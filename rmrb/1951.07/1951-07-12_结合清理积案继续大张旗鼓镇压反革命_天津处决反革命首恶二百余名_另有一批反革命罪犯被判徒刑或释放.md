　　Continuing the Vigorous Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries in Conjunction with Clearing Accumulated Cases
    Tianjin Executes Over Two Hundred Counter-Revolutionary Ring Leaders
    Another Batch of Counter-Revolutionary Criminals Sentenced to Imprisonment or Released
    [本报讯] Tianjin, in conjunction with clearing accumulated cases, continued its vigorous suppression of counter-revolutionaries, executing over two hundred counter-revolutionary ringleaders on the 10th. Based on the demands of the broad masses of the people, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government recently launched a concentrated effort to clear a batch of counter-revolutionary cases, and submitted these cases to the Municipal Public Security Bureau and People's Court for careful investigation and trial, proposing preliminary handling opinions. On July 6th, a "Counter-Revolutionary Case Review Committee" was formed, comprising fifty-seven members including all members of the Municipal Consultative Committee, some government members, responsible persons of various democratic parties, and representatives of people from all walks of life. The committee reviewed and discussed in groups the handling opinions of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and People's Court on this batch of cases. These handling opinions were then discussed and approved by a joint meeting of the Municipal People's Government Committee and the All-Circles Consultative Committee. Finally, the cases were submitted to the Municipal Military Control Commission for judgment. In accordance with the Regulations for the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, the Military Control Commission's Military Law Department sentenced a total of 605 counter-revolutionary criminals this time. Among them, 277 counter-revolutionary criminals were sentenced to death and executed immediately, 56 were sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve, 52 were sentenced to life imprisonment, 178 were sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment, and 42 were released on bail.

    The 277 counter-revolutionary criminals sentenced to death were executed in separate locations on the 10th. These counter-revolutionary criminals were all special agents, traitors, despots, habitual bandits, and heads of reactionary secret societies who had long harmed the people and were heavily in debt with blood, and their execution was insufficient to appease public anger. For example, Kuomintang agent Zhang Gongxin was trained at the "Sino-American Cooperative Organization" and massacred over 800 of our army soldiers. Li Guangzhi and others, the director and "Ti Gang Ling Zhu" of the reactionary organization "World New Buddhist Church," organized armed riots after liberation, attempting to subvert the people's government. The habitual bandit Ma Tinglan, known as the "Eighteen Arhats," sabotaged our Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan high-voltage transmission lines more than twenty times, stealing more than 200,000 catties of high-voltage transmission lines and copper wire, causing extremely serious losses to state property and transportation. In addition, criminals such as Wen Shizhen, the great traitor who served as the puppet mayor of Tianjin, and Xu Liang, the ambassador to Japan under the traitor Wang Jingwei, were all counter-revolutionary ringleaders who had consistently been enemies of the people. When these executioners, who had oppressed and slaughtered the people in those years, were escorted to the execution ground, they were all pale and trembling with fear. When they were executed, the masses who went to the execution ground to observe cheered thunderously.

    Regarding this suppression of counter-revolutionaries, Xu Jianguo, Director of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau, wrote an article in the Tianjin Daily on the 11th entitled "Correctly Implement the Policy of Combining Suppression with Leniency," stating: For more than three months, we have handled two batches of counter-revolutionary criminals, greatly upholding the people's righteousness, severely cracking down on the arrogance of counter-revolutionaries, mobilizing the masses, and safeguarding production and construction. However, because we failed to handle some counter-revolutionary cases in a timely manner, the masses are still not satisfied. Many people wrote accusations, asking the government to avenge them. At the accusation meetings recently held in various districts (with a total of about 200,000 participants), the masses proposed: "Shoot so-and-so to avenge our blood debts." Some people, who had suffered persecution from counter-revolutionary ringleaders in the past, still doubt whether the government will be lenient towards them, and fear retaliation, and dare not boldly accuse; when writing to us, they dare not sign their names. It can be seen that the counter-revolutionaries still have residual power. This shows that the demands of the masses are completely reasonable and just, and it is also entirely necessary to continue the vigorous suppression of counter-revolutionaries and crack down on their arrogance. Director Xu Jianguo, after analyzing the different treatments of counter-revolutionary elements, pointed out that this approach correctly embodies Chairman Mao's consistent instruction to combine suppression with leniency, enabling the masses to fully and comprehensively understand the people's government's policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries.

    The Tianjin Progress Daily also published an editorial on the 11th entitled "Accepting the Demands of the People and Executing Counter-Revolutionary Ringleaders," pointing out that this correct and resolute suppression of counter-revolutionaries by the government is of extremely important significance. First of all, a batch of counter-revolutionary ringleaders have been brought to justice, and those with lesser crimes have been sentenced or released. This shows that the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, on the one hand, is to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and protect the interests of the people, and on the other hand, it also points out the only way out for counter-revolutionary elements: to sincerely repent and atone for their crimes, and to bow their heads to the people. Secondly, the people have further recognized the crimes of the counter-revolutionary bandits and their serious harm to the people, and have raised their vigilance. The editorial pointed out: We must distinguish between ourselves and the enemy, strengthen vigilance, and must not relax the current work of eliminating spies and preventing special agents. The broad masses of the people must recognize that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries is a long-term and complex struggle, and should strive to assist the government in completing this political task in order to restore and develop production and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship.

　　结合清理积案继续大张旗鼓镇压反革命
    天津处决反革命首恶二百余名
    另有一批反革命罪犯被判徒刑或释放
    【本报讯】天津市结合清理积案，继续大张旗鼓镇压反革命，于十日枪决反革命首恶二百余名。根据广大人民的要求，天津市人民政府最近突击清理了一批反革命案件，并将这批案件交由市公安局、人民法院缜密调查，审理，提出初步处理意见。七月六日，市协商委员会全体委员、部分政府委员、各民主党派负责人和各界人民代表会代表共五十七人组成了“反革命案件审查委员会”，分组审查和讨论了市公安局、人民法院对这批案件的处理意见，这些处理意见又经市人民政府委员会与各界协商委员会联席会议讨论通过，最后将各案提请市军事管制委员会判决。军事管制委员会军法处依据惩治反革命条例，此次共判决反革命案犯六百零五名，计判处死刑立即执行的反革命罪犯共二百七十七人，判处死刑缓期二年执行的共五十六人，判处无期徒刑的五十二人，判处有期徒刑的一百七十八人，判令取保释放的四十二人。
    被判处死刑的二百七十七名反革命罪犯已于十日分数处执行。这些反革命罪犯，都是长期残害人民，血债累累，不杀不足以平民愤的特务、汉奸、恶霸、惯匪及反动会道门头子。如军统特务张公信曾在“中美合作所”受训，屠杀我军战士八百余人。反动组织“世界新佛教会”理事兼“提刚领主”李广志等犯，则曾在解放后组织武装暴乱，妄图颠覆人民政权。号称“十八罗汉”的惯匪马廷兰曾破坏我北京、天津、唐山间高压输电线二十余次，盗走高压输电线及铜线二十万余斤，造成了国家财产及交通事业的极为严重的损失。另外，如伪天津市长大汉奸温世珍、汪逆精卫驻日大使徐良等犯，都是一贯与人民为敌的反革命首恶。这些当年压榨与屠杀人民的刽子手，在押赴刑场时一个个吓得面如土色，浑身发抖。当他们被处决时，前往刑场参观的群众，欢声雷动。
    对于此次镇压反革命，天津市人民政府公安局长许建国以“正确贯彻镇压与宽大相结合的方针”为题，于十一日在天津日报撰文称：三个多月来，我们已经处理了两批反革命罪犯，大大伸张了人民的正气，严重地打击了反革命气焰，动员了群众，保卫了生产建设。但是，因为我们对一部分反革命案件未能及时处理，群众还不满意。很多群众写了控告信，要求政府替他们报仇。最近各区召开的控诉会上（共约二十万人参加），群众提出：“枪毙某某人，为我们讨还血债”。有些群众，过去曾遭受反革命首恶的迫害，但现在仍怀疑政府是否也会宽大他们，畏惧报复，而不敢大胆控诉；给我们写信时，也不敢署名。可见反革命还有余威。这说明群众的要求是完全合理的，正义的，继续大张旗鼓镇压反革命，打击反革命的气焰也是完全必要的。许建国局长在分析了对反革命分子的不同处理之后指出，这种作法，正确地体现了毛主席历来所指示的镇压与宽大相结合的方针，使群众完整地全面地认识了人民政府的镇压反革命政策。
    天津市进步日报也于十一日以“接受人民群众的要求处决反革命首恶分子”为题发表了社论，指出这次政府正确而坚决地镇压反革命，是有极重要的意义的。首先是一批反革命首恶伏法了，罪恶较轻的判刑或释放了，这说明镇压反革命的工作，一方面是巩固人民民主专政，保护人民利益，另一方面也给反革命分子指出了一条唯一的出路：诚意悔过赎罪，向人民低头。其次是，人民更进一步认识了反革命匪徒的罪恶和他们对人民的严重危害，而提高了警惕。社论指出：我们必须分清敌我，加强戒备，万不能松弛了当前的除奸细防特务的工作。广大人民必须认清镇压反革命是长期复杂的斗争，应努力协助政府完成这一政治任务，以恢复和发展生产，巩固人民民主专政。
