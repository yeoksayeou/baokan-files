Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

　　To the Editor:
    We are submitting the results of our investigation into the handling of the treatment of Comrade Sun Yulan's family members, along with our self-criticism.
    Comrade Sun Yulan said that the Civil Affairs Section of a certain unit sent her military service certificate to our district in 1949. Because our county was adjusting district boundaries at that time, and new and old civil affairs cadres were handing over procedures, the certificate has not been found and it is difficult to ascertain whether it was lost by us. However, in handling this issue, we mechanically emphasized that without formal military certification, we could not provide treatment as a military family; and we did not seriously solve the problem for the military family. For example, the arrival of personnel from Comrade Sun Yulan's unit and letters from leaders could in fact prove that Comrade Sun Yulan was a revolutionary soldier. But we stubbornly insisted on military certification and did not proactively contact the unit. Later, we sent a letter to the unit, but did not receive a reply, and we did not seize the opportunity to handle it, thus delaying the resolution of this problem for a long time. This shows our lack of attention to the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers and our careless work style. In addition to sincerely accepting criticism and correcting shortcomings, we have already granted Comrade Sun Yulan's family military family treatment.

### 涞水县第五区人民政府的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　涞水县第五区人民政府的检讨编辑同志：
    现将我们对处理孙玉兰同志家属待遇问题的检查结果和我们的检讨送上。
    孙玉兰同志说，某部民运科在一九四九年已给我区寄来了她的军人证明书。因当时我县正调整区划，新旧民政干部接交手续，该证明书现在没有找着，是否被我们遗失，已难查清。但我们在处理这个问题时，一直机械地强调没有军队正式证明文件，不能按军属待遇；而没有认真为军属解决问题。如孙玉兰同志所在部队来人和首长来信，事实上已能证明孙玉兰同志是革命军人。但我们仍死板地强调要军队证明书，而又没有主动地和部队联系。后来我们曾给部队去了一封信，未得答复，我们也没抓紧处理；因此使这问题拖延很久得不到解决。这说明我们对拥军优属工作的不重视和工作作风的粗枝大叶。我们除诚恳接受批评，改正缺点外，并已给孙玉兰同志家属以军属待遇。
              河北省涞水县第五区人民政府
