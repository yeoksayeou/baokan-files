New People and New Things in New China

    The Masses Love Chairman Mao
    On July 10th, the villagers of Daenlabuzi Village, Sixth District, Liaozhong County, Liaoxi Province, received good news: the Xinhua Bookstore in Xiaoxinmintun (market town) had portraits of Chairman Mao. Everyone was so happy they couldn't contain themselves and immediately urged the village cadres to buy them. The village cadres bought one hundred and twenty-eight portraits of Chairman Mao. As soon as they entered the village government, the villagers rushed in like a swarm, all competing to buy them. An old lady, Pan Hai, couldn't squeeze in and anxiously shouted from outside the crowd, "You have to sell me one, you must!" In the end, she still didn't manage to buy one, so she forcefully bought the one that the village finance and grain committee member had purchased. She said with righteous indignation, "Who told you cadres to buy so few!" The villagers happily took their portraits of Chairman Mao and went home, immediately hanging them up.

    Wang Yunshan, a Mailman at Lanzhou Post Office, Enthusiastically Helps Letter Senders Find Relatives and Friends.
    Editor:
    I am very grateful to the Lanzhou Post Office for helping me find my sister. The Lanzhou Post Office's serious attitude of serving the people represents the new spirit of the new China's postal workers. My sister lives in Lanzhou, Gansu, and I am a student at Cang County Middle School in Hebei. After May of last year, I lost contact with my sister. I missed her very much, but we were separated by thousands of miles, and I couldn't get in touch. Recently, I saw the post office's advertisement, knowing that the post office could help find lost relatives and friends, so I wrote a letter to the Lanzhou Post Office, asking them to help me find my lost sister. Half a month later, I received a reply. Wang Yunshan, a mailman from Section 11 of the Lanzhou Post Office's delivery department, finally found my sister. In Wang Yunshan's reply to me, he told me how my sister was in the hospital giving birth, the recent situation of my brother-in-law, and the reasons why my sister and I lost contact. This letter made me overjoyed. I deeply felt that only in the new China led by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao could such a thing happen.

    Farmers Praise New-Style Weddings
    Editor:
    In Zhushan Village, Wenyi Township, First District, Xiangyin County, Hunan Province, Communist Youth League members Liu Guohuang and Huang Peilan were to hold their wedding ceremony on May 25th. Their parents, like in the old society, wanted to borrow from all sides, make extravagant arrangements, prepare to slaughter a pig, host thirty tables of banquets, and hire musicians and rent sedan chairs, etc.
    The Communist Youth League branch of Wenyi Township, upon hearing this news, notified the two of them and other Youth League members to hold a discussion on how a wedding ceremony should be held so as not to be extravagant and wasteful. After returning home, they persuaded their parents separately, dispelling the original plan of extravagance and waste.
    Three days after the wedding, Huang Peilan worked with Liu Guohuang for a whole day planting cowpeas, singing songs together. This kind of loving couple who cherish labor promoted a new trend of new-style weddings in Wenyi Township, earning the praise of all the villagers.
    At the same time, the parents of both the bride and groom also happily said: "In the past, we were very anxious about our children's marriages, and we had to go through a lot of trouble. Now, thanks to Chairman Mao's leadership in the revolution and the overthrow of the feudal system, we only spent three liters of soybeans to complete our children's marriage. This is really good!"

    Carpenter Zhang Made a New Friend
    In Fu Jiaxiang, outside the East Gate of Jianshe Street, Chengguan District, Hanshou County, Hunan Province, there is a small handicraft worker named Zhang Fuchang. His family of five relies solely on his carpentry work to make a living.
    Since liberation, things have been getting better day by day. Before, he always frowned while working; now, he still works hard, but he no longer frowns. Last summer, he participated in several study sessions and heard someone explain the principles in the newspaper. From that time on, he made a new friend - the "New Hunan Daily."
    During the day, he still worked tirelessly. As soon as it got dark, it was his turn to meet his "friend." He picked up a newspaper, looked at it again and again, read it over and over, and even made a newspaper rack to put on the street. The next day, he put the newspaper on the rack for the neighboring farmers and passers-by to read. Whenever Zhang Fuchang had free time and talked to people, he talked about the content of the newspaper and the reasons for resisting America and aiding Korea. He has been reading the newspaper, explaining it, and enthusiastically publicizing it to the masses for more than a year. Carpenter Zhang's spirit of caring about politics, studying current affairs, and publicizing current affairs is worthy of everyone's learning.

    Eliminate Feudal Ideas That Discriminate Against Women
　  The Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau's Secondary Health Technical School Should Not Stipulate That It Does Not Accept Married Women in Its Unified Enrollment.
    Editor:
    The unified enrollment brochure of the Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau's secondary health technical school stipulates that married women cannot apply. I believe that this erroneous practice of depriving married women of their right to study is a violation of the spirit of the Common Program. The application period has already arrived, and I hope that the bureau will quickly abolish this unreasonable restriction so that married women can also have the opportunity to apply.
            Reader Huang Difai

    Editor's Note: The stipulation in the unified enrollment of the Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau's secondary health technical school that married women are not accepted is a manifestation of feudalistic thinking that discriminates against women. The Ministry of Personnel of the Central People's Government issued a "Notice on Abolishing the Regulation of 'Not Accepting Pregnant Women' When Recruiting Staff and Trainees" at the end of May, pointing out that this regulation "is inconsistent with the spirit of the Common Program." The Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau should immediately abolish the erroneous regulation of not accepting married women in accordance with this notice; and conscientiously study the provision in the Common Program that "The People's Republic of China abolishes the feudal system that shackles women. Women have equal rights with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, educational, and social life," and eliminate feudal ideas that discriminate against women.

    新中国新人新事
　　群众热爱毛主席
    七月十日，辽西省辽中县六区大嗯拉卜子村老乡们得了一个喜报：小新民屯（集镇）新华书店有了毛主席像。大家都乐得沉不住气，立刻催村干部去买。村干部买回来一百二十八张毛主席像，刚走进村政府，老乡们就蜂涌似地跟进去，大家争着买。有一位潘海老大娘挤不进去，急得在人群外直嚷：“不卖给我不行，你们说啥也得卖给我一张！”结果，她还是没有买着。她就强把村财粮委员买下的那一张买去了。她理直气壮地说：“谁让你们干部买少了！”老乡们拿着毛主席像乐呵呵地笑着回家去，马上把像挂了起来。

　　农民赞美新式结婚编辑同志：
    湖南省湘阴一区文义乡珠山村，青年团员刘国煌和黄佩兰要在五月二十五日举行结婚典礼。他俩的家长，像旧社会里一样，想东挪西借，大事铺张，准备杀个猪，办三十桌酒席，并请鼓乐先生，租轿子等等。
    文义乡的青年团支部听到这个消息，便通知他俩和其他团员开了一个座谈会，讨论应该怎样举行结婚典礼，才不铺张浪费。他俩回到家里，分头说服了家长，打消了原来铺张浪费的计划。
    结婚后第三天，黄佩兰就同着刘国煌栽了一天豆角，并同声唱着歌，这种热爱劳动的美满夫妻，为文义乡提倡了新式结婚的新风气，博得全乡人民赞美。
    同时男女双方家长也欢喜地说：“从前对于儿女的婚姻大事蛮着急，要打好多没脚筋斗，现在感谢毛主席领导革命，打倒了封建制度，咱只花了三升黄豆子，就完成了儿女的婚姻大事，这样真个好！

　　张木匠交了一个新朋友
    湖南省汉寿县城关区建设街东门外符家巷有个小手工业者叫张傅长，一家五口，就只靠他一人做木匠过活。
    解放以后，光景一天天不同了，以前，他老是皱着眉头地干；现在，干还是干，却不再皱眉头了。去年夏天，他参加了几次学习，听见有人跟他讲报上的道理，这时候起，他结识了一个新朋友——《新湖南报》。
    在白天，他还是手不停脚不住地做活。天一黑，就轮着他和“朋友”见面了。他拿起一张报纸，看了又看，读了又读，并且做了一个报架子摆在街上。到第二天，他就把报放在架子上，供邻近的农友们和过路的人看。张傅长一有闲空和人家谈天，他谈的就是报纸上的材料，抗美援朝的道理。他这样读报、讲报、热心向群众宣传已经一年多了。张木匠这种关心政治、学习时事、宣传时事的精神，值得大家学习。

　　肃清歧视妇女的封建思想
　  北京市公共卫生局中级卫生技术学校统一招生时不应规定不收已婚妇女编辑同志：
    北京市公共卫生局中级卫生技术学校统一招生简章规定已婚妇女不能投考。我认为：这种剥夺已婚妇女学习权利的错误做法，是违反共同纲领精神的。现在报名期已到了，希望该局迅速取消这种不合理的限制，让已婚妇女也能得到投考机会。
            读者  黄涤非
    编者按：北京市公共卫生局中级卫生技术学校统一招生时规定不收已婚妇女；这是一种歧视妇女的封建主义思想的表现。中央人民政府人事部在五月底已发出“关于废除招考工作人员及学员时‘不收孕妇’规定的通知”，指出这种规定“是和共同纲领的精神不相符合的”。北京市公共卫生局应立即根据这个通知，废除不收已婚妇女的错误规定；并认真学习共同纲领中“中华人民共和国废除束缚妇女的封建制度。妇女在政治的、经济的、文化教育的、社会的生活各方面，均有与男子平等的权利”这项规定，肃清歧视妇女的封建思想。
