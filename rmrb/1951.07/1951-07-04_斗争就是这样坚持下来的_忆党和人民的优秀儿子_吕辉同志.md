This is How the Struggle Was Sustained
    In Memory of Comrade Lü Hui, An Outstanding Son of the Party and the People
    Hu Ming

　　After the Southern Anhui Incident, in the Southern Anhui region, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, a people's guerrilla force was established to persist in arduous struggle. During this arduous struggle, a group of outstanding Communist Party members emerged. Comrade Lü Hui was one of them.

　　Before the Southern Anhui Incident, Comrade Lü Hui was a cultural instructor in a company of the New Fourth Army and was captured in the incident. However, on the way to the concentration camp, Comrade Lü Hui and several other captured comrades managed to escape. After escaping, they found the Party again. Later, Comrade Lü Hui was still sent to the guerrilla force as a cultural instructor. He and the guerrillas carried a tube-loading rifle, wore straw sandals, walked in the dark, ate bitter herbs, lived in mountain sheds, and began the life of guerrilla warfare.

　　Two years later, the Party decided to send Comrade Lü Hui with five armed work team members to open up work in the Jing (County), Ning (Guo), and Xuan (Cheng) areas. This work was not easy to do. First, they had to learn armed struggle and how to do mass work. However, Lü Hui was not familiar with armed struggle. The first time, he led this small armed work team to ambush in the mountains of Xuan City, but fired before the enemy entered the ambush circle, resulting in only one enemy being wounded, and the others running away. The battle was not well fought, and everyone complained that the command was not good. Comrade Lü Hui was not discouraged, and the second time they attacked a puppet township office in Jingde, but still failed to take it. Although he encountered several setbacks, Comrade Lü Hui was not discouraged. Later, they cooperated with other guerrilla teams in several battles and gained some spoils of war; in this way, they fought more and more battles, and their skills also improved. Later, when they attacked the enemy in Hecun and the winter defense team in Jing County, they completely eliminated the enemy. In this way, Comrade Lü Hui learned the skills of armed struggle.

　　In addition to leading the guerrillas to fight, Comrade Lü Hui also had to do mass work. The work in the Jing, Ning, and Xuan areas was difficult to do. The situation in this area was complex, there were many special agents, and the enemy's intelligence network was very tight. After Comrade Lü Hui entered this area, he firmly grasped the basic link of relying on the masses. They deeply carried out mass work and solved difficulties for the masses. After a period of work and struggle, they established a flesh-and-blood relationship with the masses. They had the strength and methods to not only overcome various difficulties, but also avoid many dangers. Once, there were several traitors in Dafang Mountain, Ningguo, who pretended to be active and gained the trust of Comrade Lü Hui. They secretly arranged a trap with the enemy, preparing to send someone to entertain Lü Hui's armed work team when they next operated in Dafang Mountain, while sending someone to inform the enemy to surround them, and wipe out Lü Hui's armed work team in one fell swoop. The traitors' conspiracy was vicious, and in the past, several Red guerrillas had suffered from them here. However, this time it was different, the masses told Comrade Lü Hui about the traitors' conspiracy in advance. Comrade Lü Hui was not harmed, on the contrary, he gave the traitors the punishment they deserved.

　　In the summer of 1946, Comrade Lü Hui underwent a severe test. At this time, a rebellion occurred in the guerrilla team he led. Several impure elements within the troops could not withstand the test of the cruel struggle, and went from wavering to colluding with the enemy. One day, these traitors took advantage of Comrade Lü Hui's absence to organize a major internal rebellion, killing three cadres and dragging away more than ten guns. The guerrilla team that Comrade Lü Hui had worked so hard to build was almost destroyed by them, leaving only eight or nine people. But Comrade Lü Hui was not discouraged, he told the organization: "I will never leave Banqiao (the guerrilla base), I will resolutely work in Banqiao." Comrade Lü Hui's confidence was based on the fact that he had a flesh-and-blood relationship with the masses, the masses said: "As long as Lü Hui is here, we will continue to work as usual, if we have the Communist Party, we will have a way." In addition, there were eight or nine comrades who had been tested with him as the backbone, plus the support of the masses, he had confidence and strength. Comrade Lü Hui buried the bodies of his comrades, reviewed the mistakes of his leadership, and continued to persist in the struggle. The Party flag still fluttered in the mountains of Banqiao.

　　1947 was a year of great development in Southern Anhui. Guerrilla warfare and mass movements were vigorously unfolding. Guerrilla teams in Southern Anhui, Southern Jiangsu, and other places grew from more than 800 people to more than 3,000 people, and base areas also began to be built. These victories echoed and cooperated with the People's Liberation Army's southward advance. The enemy, heading towards death, in order to consolidate his river defenses, organized greater forces to attack the guerrilla teams. This enemy "encirclement and suppression" lasted from the winter of 1947 to the spring of 1948. The Banqiao area of Jing, Ning, and Xuan was one of the key points of the enemy's "encirclement and suppression" at that time. At this time, the Jingningxuan guerrilla team had grown to two or three hundred people, and Comrade Lü Hui (then deputy secretary of the county party committee) led this armed force in a tenacious struggle against the enemy, and achieved continuous victories. In January 1948, the enemy, with the 63rd Division as the main force, concentrated a force of about 2,000 people and occupied Banqiao, and the struggle entered a more difficult stage. At this time, Comrade Lü Hui led a company and transferred to activities outside the line. When they transferred to the Candle Mountain area on the border of Jing and Ning. The enemy surrounded them in several directions. Comrade Lü Hui concentrated his forces, defeated one enemy force, and annihilated a platoon of the Ningguo enemy self-defense force. This battle was originally fought very beautifully, but when the battle was about to end, Comrade Lü Hui exposed his command target and was shot through the lower abdomen by the enemy's stray bullet and immediately fell down. Lying in a pool of blood, he shouted to his comrades: "I'm not going to make it, don't worry about me, you go and eliminate the enemy quickly." Comrade Lü Hui, the outstanding son of the Party and the people, thus shed his last drop of blood, he was only twenty-six years old when he died.

　　斗争就是这样坚持下来的
    忆党和人民的优秀儿子——吕辉同志
    胡明
    皖南事变后，皖南地区，在中国共产党的领导下，建立了一支人民游击队，坚持着艰苦的斗争。在这艰苦的斗争中，出现了一批优秀的共产党员。吕辉同志是其中的一个。
    皖南事变以前，吕辉同志是新四军一个连队的文化教员，在事变中被俘。但在被解往集中营的路上，吕辉同志和其他几位被俘的同志设法逃出来了。逃出来之后，又找到了党的关系。以后，吕辉同志仍被派到游击队里当文化教员。他就和游击队员们一道，背起一支套筒步枪，穿草鞋，摸黑路，吃苦菜，住山棚，开始了游击战争生活。
    二年后，党决定吕辉同志带领五个武工队员，开辟泾（县）、宁（国）、宣（城）地区的工作。这个工作是不容易作的。首先必须学会武装斗争和学会做群众工作。但是，对于武装斗争，吕辉是不熟悉的。第一次，他带这一支小武工队在宣城山里打埋伏，没有等敌人进入伏击圈就打了枪，结果只打伤了一个敌人，其他的都跑了。仗打得不好，大家都埋怨说指挥不行。吕辉同志不灰心，第二次又打旌德一个伪乡公所，也没有打下来。虽然碰了几次钉子，吕辉同志并不灰心。以后，他们配合别的游击队打了几仗，有了一些缴获；这样仗愈打愈多，本事也打出来了。以后打何村敌人，打泾县冬防队，都是干脆彻底地消灭了敌人。就这样，吕辉同志学会了武装斗争的本事。
    吕辉同志除了带游击队打仗之外，还要做群众工作。泾、宁、宣地区的工作是难做的。这个地区情况复杂，特务多，敌人的情报网也很严密。吕辉同志进入这个地区后，就紧紧掌握住依靠群众这一基本环节。他们深入地开展群众工作，并替群众解决困难。经过一个时期的工作和斗争之后，他们和群众建立了血肉相连的关系。他们有了力量和办法，不仅克服了各种困难，而且避免了多次危险。有一次，宁国大方山有几个叛徒，以假装积极的办法骗取了吕辉同志的信任。他们和敌人暗中布置好了一个圈套，准备下一次吕辉武工队活动到大方山时，一面派人招待，一面派人报信给敌人来包围，把吕辉武工队一网打尽。叛徒们的阴谋是毒辣的，过去曾有几个红色游击队员就在这里吃过他们的亏。但是，这一次不同了，群众事先把叛徒的阴谋告诉吕辉同志。吕辉同志没有受到危害，相反地，给予几个叛徒以应有的惩罚。
    一九四六年夏，吕辉同志受了一次严重的考验。这时他所带的游击队内发生了一次叛变。部队内部有几个不纯分子，经不起残酷斗争的考验，由动摇而走向和敌人勾结。有一天，这些叛徒乘吕辉同志外出工作，组织一次内部大叛变，打死三个干部，拖走十多支枪。吕辉同志辛苦经营的游击队几乎被他们搞垮，只剩下八、九个人了。但是吕辉同志并没有灰心丧气，他向组织上表示：“我决不离开板桥（游击根据地），我坚决在板桥干。”吕辉同志的信心是有根据的，他有着和群众血肉相连的关系，群众说：“只要吕辉在，我们就照样干，有共产党我们就有办法。”此外，和他在一起的，还有八、九个经过考验的同志为骨干，再加上群众的拥护，就有了信心和力量。吕辉同志掩埋了自己同志们的尸体，检讨了自己领导的错误，继续坚持斗争。党的旗帜仍然飘扬在板桥山里。
    一九四七年在皖南是个大发展的一年。游击战争、群众运动蓬蓬勃勃地展开着。皖南、苏南等地游击队由八百多人发展到三千多人，根据地也开始建设了。这些胜利和人民解放军的南下大军起了呼应和配合的作用。走向死亡的敌人为着巩固他的江防，组织更大的力量向游击队进攻。敌人这一次“清剿”，从一九四七年冬一直延续到一九四八年春。泾、宁、宣板桥地区，是当时敌人“清剿”的重点之一。这时泾宁宣游击队已经发展到二、三百人，吕辉同志（当时任县委副书记）率领着这支武装和敌人进行着顽强的斗争，并取得不断的胜利。一九四八年一月，敌人以六十三师为主力，集中约二千人的兵力，进占板桥，斗争遂进入更艰苦的阶段。这时吕辉同志率一个连，转出外线活动。当他们转到旌、宁边蜡烛山地区时。敌人分几路来包围他们。吕辉同志集中力量，击溃一路敌人，消灭了宁国敌自卫队一个排。这一仗本来打得很漂亮，但在战斗快结束时，吕辉同志暴露了自己的指挥目标，被敌人的冷枪打穿了小腹，立刻倒下去了。他躺在血泊里，对同志们喊着：“我不行了，你们不要管我，你们快去消灭敌人。”吕辉同志，党和人民的优秀儿子，就此流尽了最后一滴血，他牺牲时年仅二十六岁。
