The State Council's "Instructions on Agricultural Tax Work for 1951," issued on June 21st, stipulates, in addition to the collection methods for different regions, that "the People's Governments (Military and Political Committees) of all major administrative regions must, in accordance with the 'Implementation Outline for Agricultural Tax Land Survey and Production Assessment Work' issued by the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government, guide the People's Governments of all provinces (municipalities) to promote land survey and production assessment work with leadership and planning." Today, the "Implementation Outline for Agricultural Tax Land Survey and Production Assessment Work" has been officially issued by the Ministry of Finance of the Central Government. Land survey and production assessment is a major issue in rural areas across the country, and local people's governments at all levels must pay universal attention to this work.

According to the provisions of the Implementation Outline for Agricultural Tax Land Survey and Production Assessment Work, old areas should clarify land acreage and determine actual production in the next two years, and fix their production; new areas should strive to ascertain land acreage and determine actual production within three to four years from the year of land reform, and fix their production. After production is fixed, it shall not be changed arbitrarily, except due to changes in natural land conditions (such as water erosion, sand covering, etc.) and other legal provisions.

Without a doubt, this is an important and arduous task. Some people therefore raise the question: "Now that there are so many busy tasks in rural areas, is it necessary to carry out agricultural tax land survey and production assessment work?" In fact, this is very necessary. First, in order to guarantee the state's financial revenue. Agricultural tax is one of the important financial sources for national defense and economic construction, and land survey and production assessment is the foundation of agricultural tax work. It is necessary to clarify land acreage and determine actual production so that collection work can be effectively guaranteed. If land survey and production assessment is not done well, collection tasks often cannot be completed on time. Second, in order to make the burden fair and reasonable. Unfair burdens often cause public resentment. Therefore, this is an issue related to the relationship between the People's Government and nearly 400 million peasants, and it is also an issue related to the worker-peasant alliance. Third, in order to encourage peasants' production enthusiasm. Chairman Mao once clearly instructed in "On Economic and Financial Problems" that we should "enable peasants to calculate the amount of tax they pay according to the quantity and quality of their cultivated land. With this calculation, peasants can calculate the proportion of their annual family income and expenditure, and they can let go and engage in production, thereby increasing their enthusiasm for production and ensuring increased grain production; there will be no unfairness in government taxation." At present, in many places, land acreage has not been clarified, and land yields are temporarily assessed every time the collection season arrives. Even if the government announces the tax law and tax rate in advance, peasants often cannot calculate the amount of tax they pay. Therefore, peasants in some places say, "Production is not energetic because yields are not fixed." The Agricultural Tax Law clearly stipulates that agricultural tax should be levied according to normal annual yields, and those who work hard to increase production will not have their taxes increased, and those who are lazy in cultivation will not have their taxes reduced. The State Council's decision on agricultural and forestry production in 1951 also emphasized this policy. However, this policy is difficult to fully implement when yields have not been determined. Fourth, in order to reduce the burden on local people's governments in agricultural tax work. After land acreage is clarified and yields are fixed, agricultural tax investigation will become a general routine registration task for the financial departments of local people's governments, and collection work will be greatly simplified as a result. In this way, local governments can free up more time to lead other work, which will be a favorable condition for improving the work of local governments.

However, some other comrades have doubts: "Agricultural tax land survey and production assessment work is a complex and detailed task. Under the conditions that the old areas have not been completely done well, is it possible to require all parts of the country to do this work well within a few years?" Our answer is possible. Why?

First, our old liberated areas already have a foundation of several or more than ten years of agricultural tax work. Many mass campaigns against concealed land and yield assessment movements have been carried out. Now, in some areas, land acreage has been largely clarified, and the assessment of yields is close to reality. As long as it is reviewed and adjustments are made to individual inappropriate cases, it can be fixed. In other areas, although the yield assessment has not been carefully and repeatedly assessed, and the authenticity is somewhat poor, we already have a relatively good understanding of the local situation, and adjustments and revisions can be made on the existing basis to achieve the goal of authenticity. Only a small number of areas that were liberated later do not have the basis for yield assessment, but this is a small part, and considerable efforts can be concentrated on investigation and assessment, which is relatively easy to solve.

Second, the vast new liberated areas have completed land reform, and the remaining parts will also be completed this winter and next spring. This is an earth-shaking great mass movement, and it is also an excellent opportunity to clear up land acreage. In general new areas, landlords' concealed land has been cleared up in the process of speaking out bitterness and dividing classes; poor peasants' land has been largely clarified in the process of distributing land; and there is a general understanding of middle peasants' land when land certificates are issued. As long as the leadership does not miss the opportunity, unifies its forces, and grasps statistics, it can basically clear up land acreage statistics. After land reform, the masses' awareness has been greatly improved. As long as the government provides planned leadership, it can make a preliminary assessment of yields within one or two years. After one or two years of actual testing, it can reach a true level. Therefore, it is completely possible for new areas to clarify land acreage, determine actual production, and fix their production within three to four years from the year of land reform.

Third, we already have preliminary experience in assessing yields in a "fair, reasonable, simple, and easy" way. This is the method of "government investigation to determine production, combined with democratic appraisal." Before 1950, the agricultural tax land survey and production assessment work in various places mostly adopted this method, that is, mobilizing the masses within each township to "self-report and public discussion" and "democratic appraisal." Due to repeated assessments over the years, it can gradually reach the requirements of fairness and reasonableness. However, this handicraft method is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and often achieves half the results with twice the effort. Moreover, the degree of awareness of the masses and the strength of cadres vary from place to place, and it is difficult for this appraisal to balance the burden in the vast areas. Although some areas have adopted methods such as "joint township appraisal" and "mobile surveying," which have changed the unbalanced state to some extent, they have not yet created a relatively complete set of experiences that can be promoted on a large scale. During last year's autumn harvest, the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government put forward a new method of "investigating and determining production, combined with appraisal." Over the past six months, after experiments in various places, it has been proved that this method is basically applicable to both new and old areas, plains and mountains. As long as we can conduct in-depth investigation and research and extensively mobilize the masses, we can achieve good results. It is not only much better than the handicraft-style "self-reporting and public discussion" in each township, but also a big step forward compared with "joint township appraisal." The content of this method is roughly the same as the provisions of Article 3 of the Outline for Agricultural Tax Land Survey and Production Assessment Work: "The township (village) people's government shall mobilize the peasant masses to clarify the land category and assess the land grade. The county people's government shall review the materials reported by the township (village), conduct in-depth typical investigations, and determine the normal annual yield of various types and grades of land. For the sake of prudence, when time permits, the production plan may be submitted to the county people's congress or the district peasant representative meeting for discussion and determination." Of course, the specific steps in various regions should also be different. For example, in areas where there is a basis for yield assessment, necessary adjustments should be made on the original basis, and it should not be kicked away and started from scratch; there should also be differences between mountains and plains, northwest and south of the Yangtze River. These all need to be adapted to local conditions.

The possibility of doing a good job in land survey and production assessment exists; how to turn this possibility into reality depends on leadership. This requires people's governments at all levels to promote land survey and production assessment work with leadership and planning. The experience of many regions has proved that the "investigation and production assessment" method is relatively simple and easy to implement, which can reduce the difficulty of combining land survey and production assessment with other work. Yanshi County in Henan Province, Qinyang County, Bo'ai County, and Wen County in Pingyuan Province, and other places, due to the appropriate arrangements made by the leadership for this work, and the adoption of the "investigation and production assessment" method, have completed the county's production assessment work in about a month. Other parallel tasks such as resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, spring plowing and production, and combating drought and planting cotton have not been hindered, and patriotic education of the masses has been strengthened and the production enthusiasm of the masses has been improved in the process of determining production. This experience is worth promoting. In the land survey and production assessment work, it is necessary to widely publicize and mobilize the masses, strictly prevent coercion and commandism; it is necessary to conduct in-depth investigations, seek truth from facts, and resolutely oppose the tendency of being too high, and at the same time prevent the tendency of being too low.

Clarifying land acreage and determining production, so as to achieve fairness and reasonableness of the burden, is a major problem that has not been well resolved in my country's rural areas for thousands of years. All localities must resolutely implement the various provisions of the "Implementation Outline for Agricultural Tax Land Survey and Production Assessment Work" and strive for the victorious completion of this work.

### 有领导地有计划地推行查田定产工作

　　有领导地有计划地推行查田定产工作
    六月二十一日政务院颁发的《关于一九五一年农业税工作的指示》中，除规定了不同地区的征收办法外，并明确规定“各大行政区人民政府（军政委员会）须依照中央人民政府财政部所发《农业税查田定产工作实施纲要》，指导各省（市）人民政府有领导地有计划地推行查田定产工作”。今天，《农业税查田定产工作实施纲要》已由中央财政部正式发布了。查田定产，在全国各地农村中是一个重大问题，各级地方人民政府必须对这一工作普遍地加以注意。
    根据农业税查田定产工作实施纲要的规定，老区要在今明两年内查清田亩、订实产量，并固定其产量；新区自土地改革之年起，争取三、四年内查实田亩、订实产量，并固定其产量。产量固定之后，除因土地自然条件的变化（如水冲、沙压等）及法令别有规定者外，不得随意变动。
    毫无疑问，这是一个重要而艰巨的任务。有些人因此提出这样的疑问：“现在农村中各项工作十分烦忙，有没有必要来进行农业税查田定产工作呢？”事实上，这是很必要的。第一，为了保证国家财政收入。农业税是国防建设和经济建设的重要财政来源之一，查田定产则是农业税工作的基础，必须查清田亩，订实产量，征收工作才能有确切的保证。查田定产没有做好，征收任务往往不能按时完成。第二，为了使负担公平合理。负担不公，往往引起群众责难。因此，这是一个有关人民政府和近四亿农民的关系问题，也是有关工农联盟的一个问题。第三，为了鼓励农民的生产情绪。毛主席在《论经济问题和财政问题》中，曾经明白指示过，应当“使农民能够按照自己耕地的量和质计算交税数目。农民有了这个计算，就可计算他全年全家收支的比例，就可放手进行生产，而增加生产积极性，保证粮食的增产；政府征税时也就不发生不公平的问题了”。现在许多地方，田亩没有查清，田亩产量则是每到征收时节，临时评订，即使政府事先宣布了税法、税率，农民仍往往算不出自己交税的数目。所以有些地方农民说“产量没一定，生产不上劲”。农业税法中曾明白规定：农业税按常年应产量征收，勤劳增产者不增税，怠于耕作者不减税。政务院关于一九五一年农林生产的决定中，又强调了这一个政策。但是在产量没有订实的情况下，这一政策是难于完满实现的。第四，为了减轻地方人民政府的在农业税工作方面的负担。在地亩查清，产量固定之后，农业税的调查将成为地方人民政府财政部门一般日常的登记工作，征收工作亦将因此而大形简化，这样，地方政府就可以腾出更多的时间领导其他工作，这对于改进地方政府工作，将是一个有利的条件。
    但是另外有些同志却有这样的疑问：“农业税查田定产工作是一个复杂而细腻的工作，在老区还没有完全搞好条件下，现在要求全国各地在几年之内都要做好这一工作，是否可能呢？”我们的答复是可能的。为什么呢？
    首先，我们的老解放区，已经有了几年或十几年的农业税工作的基础。开展过许多次的群众性的反瞒田斗争和评产量运动。现在，有些地区田亩已经大体查清，产量的评订也接近真实，只要加以审查，对个别不适当者予以调整，即可以加以固定了。还有些地区的产量虽没有经过仔细地反复评定，真实性也差一些，但我们对当地的情况已经比较了解，在已有基础上加以调整改订，也可以达到真实的目的。只有一小部分解放较晚的地区，没有评产量的基础，但这是一小部分，可以集中相当力量进行调查评订，也是比较容易解决的。
    其次，广大新解放区，已经完成了土地改革，其余部分也将于今冬明春完成。这是一个翻天覆地的伟大的群众运动，也是清查田亩的绝好时机。一般新区，在诉苦、划阶级过程中，已把地主的瞒田清查出来；在分配土地过程中，已把贫农的土地大体弄清；在颁发土地证的时候，则对中农的土地也有一个大体的了解。只要领导上不失时机，统一力量，抓紧统计，就可以基本上把田亩调查统计清楚。经过土地改革，群众觉悟大大提高之后，只要政府有计划地加以领导，则可以在一年或二年之内，把产量作一初步地评订。再经过一年或二年的实际考验，就能达到真实的地步。所以说：新区从土地改革之年起，三、四年内查清田亩，订实产量并固定其产量，是完全可能的。
    第三，我们已经有了“公平合理，简便易行”的评订产量的初步经验。这就是“政府调查定产，结合民主评议”的方法。一九五○年以前的农业税查田定产工作，各地大都采用这样的方法，即在各乡之内发动群众“自报公议”和“民主评议”的方法。由于历年的多次评订，也能逐渐达到公平合理的要求。但这种手工业的方法，费时费力，往往事倍功半。且各地群众的觉悟程度不一，干部力量强弱不同，这种评议很难使广大地区的负担都趋于平衡。有些地区虽采用了“联乡评议”、“流动勘察”等方法，多少改变了一些不平衡的状态，但尚未创造出一套比较完整可以大量推行的经验。去年秋征中，浙江省人民政府提出了“调查定产，结合评议”的新方法，半年来，经过各地的实验，证明这一方法，无论对于新区、老区，平原、山地，基本上都是适用的。只要能深入调查研究，广泛发动群众，即能收到良好效果。它不仅比手工业式的各乡“自报公议”好得多，而且比“联乡评议”也大大提高了一步。这个方法的内容，大体说来，就是如农业税查田定产纲要第三条的规定“由乡（村）人民政府发动农民群众查清土地类别，评定土地等级。县人民政府应审查乡（村）所报材料，进行典型的深入调查，订出各类各等土地的常年应产量。为慎重起见，在时间许可时，可将订产方案提交县人民代表会议或区农民代表会议讨论后订定”。当然，在各种地区的具体步骤，还应有所不同。例如：在产量评订已有基础的地区，即应在原有基础上加以必要的调整，不可一脚踢开，从头做起；在山地和平原，西北和江南，也应各有不同。这都是需要因地制宜的。
    做好查田定产工作的可能性是存在的；如何把这种可能性变为现实性，关键在于领导。这就是要求各级人民政府有领导地有计划地推行查田定产工作，许多地区的经验证明：“调查定产”的方法比较简便易行，可以减少查田定产与其他工作结合的困难。河南省的偃师县、平原省的沁阳县、博爱县、温县等地，由于领导上对这一工作适当安排，并采用了“调查定产”的方法，均在一个月左右的时间内完成了全县的订产工作，与之并行的其他工作如抗美援朝、镇压反革命、春耕生产和抗旱植棉等，并没有受到妨碍，而且在订定产量工作中加强了群众的爱国主义教育，提高了群众的生产情绪。这一经验是值得推广的。在查田定产工作中必需广泛宣传，发动群众，严格地防止强迫命令；必须深入调查，实事求是，坚决地反对偏高的偏向，同时也要防止偏低的偏向。
    查清田亩订好产量，从而使负担达到公平合理，这是我国农村中几千年来没有很好解决的一大问题。各地必须坚决贯彻《农业税查田定产工作实施纲要》的各项规定，争取这一工作的胜利完成。
