Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 21st: Chinese and Korean People's Cultural Troupes are performing in various parts of Korea, offering comfort to the Chinese and Korean People's forces. After arriving at a certain place in the rear of Korea at the beginning of this month, a certain Chinese People's Cultural Troupe immediately went to various places to perform in rotation, comforting the Korean military and civilians. The Chinese folk music and dances performed by the cultural troupe, as well as operas and dramas with the theme of the Chinese people's movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, have been warmly praised by the Korean military and civilians.
    Six cultural troupes, including the Korean National Theater, the Youth Theater, the Ministry of Internal Affairs Theater, the National Art Theater, and the People's Army Concerto Troupe, have been performing in the garrisons of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers since June 17. In the past month, they have performed more than 200 times.
    The in-depth performances for the troops by the Chinese and Korean People's Cultural Troupes have not only boosted the fighting will of the Chinese and Korean People's armies, but also further enhanced the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean people. "The East is Red," "Following Mao Zedong," and "General Kim Il-sung's Song" have become the most familiar and beloved songs of the Chinese and Korean People's soldiers.

　　中、朝人民文工团在朝鲜各地劳军
    【新华社平壤二十一日电】中国和朝鲜的人民文工团正在朝鲜各地演出，慰劳中、朝人民部队。我国某人民文工团自本月初抵达朝鲜后方某地后，即到各地作巡回公演，慰问朝鲜军民。该文工团所演出的我国民族音乐和舞蹈以及以我国人民抗美援朝运动为主题的歌剧、话剧，受到朝鲜军民热烈的赞扬。
    朝鲜国立剧场、青年剧团、内务省剧团、国立艺术剧场、人民军协奏团等六个文工团，自六月十七日起，分别赴朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军各驻地演出。一个月来，共计已演出二百余次。
    中、朝人民文工团深入劳军，不但鼓舞了中、朝人民军队的战斗意志，而且进一步增进了中、朝人民的战斗友谊。《东方红》、《跟着毛泽东走》与《金日成将军之歌》，已经成为中、朝人民战士们最熟悉和最喜爱的歌曲。
