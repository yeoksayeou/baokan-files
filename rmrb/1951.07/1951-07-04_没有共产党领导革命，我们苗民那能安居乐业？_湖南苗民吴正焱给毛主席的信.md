　　Without the Communist Party Leading the Revolution, How Could We Miao People Live and Work in Peace and Contentment?
    ——A Letter from Wu Zhengyan, a Miao Farmer in Hunan, to Chairman Mao

Respected Chairman Mao:

    Under the call of the People's Government for production, the farmers in our village are all processing fertilizer, and the crops this year look particularly good. The rice seedlings in the mountains and fields are especially lush, and there will surely be a good harvest in the autumn. Now we all know how to use our own abilities and techniques to overcome difficulties, and we no longer rely on gods and spirits. When the rice ripens, we ask the relevant authorities to send personnel to the countryside to evaluate who is a labor hero for us.

    The local people all have the confidence to contribute their utmost to resist America and aid Korea through practical actions.

    Chairman Mao, "July 1st" is the greatest day. Without the establishment of the Communist Party back then, how could the Miao people have today's peaceful and happy life? The day commemorating the 30th anniversary of the Communist Party will be our happiest and most beloved day! We extend to you our most sublime respect!

                           Wu Zhengyan, Miao Farmer, Xinping Township Miao Region, Qiancheng First District, Hunan

　　没有共产党领导革命，我们苗民那能安居乐业？
    ——湖南苗民吴正焱给毛主席的信敬爱的毛主席：
    我们村子里的农民，在人民政府生产号召下，人人都加工施肥，本年的庄稼格外的好看，山里田里的秧苗特别的茂盛，秋天一定有很好的收成。现在我们都知道用自己能力技术来克服困难，不靠鬼神了。到稻子成熟时，我们要求有关机关派员下乡，为我们评一下谁为劳动英雄。
    本地人民都有用实际行动各尽其力来抗美援朝的信心。
    毛主席，“七一”是最伟大的一天。没有当年共产党的成立，苗民那能有今天的安居乐业？纪念共产党三十周年的一天将是我们最高兴最喜爱的一天！向你敬致最崇高的礼！
                           湖南乾城一区新坪乡苗区农民  吴正焱
