　　Review of the Overturned Vehicle Incident on the Ganqing Highway

Editor Comrades:

    We believe that Wu Hengqin's letter in the People's Daily's reader's column on June 16, reflecting on the overturning incident on the Ganqing Highway in Northwest China and suggesting attention to safe driving, is correct. The following is our review and response:

    (1) The vehicle involved in the accident was a 1936 ZIS car, quite old but not beyond its serviceable life, and deemed qualified after inspection by the Transportation Supervision Office. After the accident, the front wheel tie rod of the car was bent, but the "monk's head" screw was intact. This proves that there were no problems with the car's steering system. The accident was caused by the driver's poor skills, as he turned off the ignition to save fuel while going downhill too fast. After the incident, the five people who died on the spot were provided with coffins by the Transportation Company of our department, and they assisted the families of the deceased in handling the burial. The court ruled that the transportation company should provide settlement expenses. All the remaining slightly and seriously injured were sent to the Transportation Hospital of our department for treatment, at the expense of the Transportation Company. To date, all but two people are recuperating and have been discharged from the hospital.

    (2) The occurrence of the overturning incident exposed the serious irresponsible work style and unsound working system within our transportation department. To learn from the past and avoid future mistakes, we have sent the driver, Hu Dingsan, to the court for legal punishment. Other relevant personnel, such as the manager of the transportation company, the head of the management field, the head of the management station, and the head of the supervision office, have all conducted thorough self-criticisms; and have been given penalties such as removal from office, demerits, and criticism, respectively.

    (3) The fuel-saving reward system has been suspended since May; and all transportation companies and stations have been instructed to strengthen and improve ticketing and management systems (a working group is inspecting). We are currently holding the Second Northwest Regional Supervision Conference. The main topic of this conference is safe driving, and we will propose reward methods for safe driving. As for the issue of the work style of the Lanzhou Station raised by Comrade Wu, we have ordered it to be thoroughly checked.

    (4) It is true that the road surface condition of the Gansu section of the Ganqing Highway is not good. We have already noticed this problem, and this year we plan to mobilize laborers to carry out a comprehensive repair and paving with sand. The Central People's Government has allocated special funds for the remaining bridges and dangerous sections to carry out focused repairs.

### 西北军政委员会交通部　对甘青公路翻车事件的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

  　西北军政委员会交通部
　　对甘青公路翻车事件的检讨编辑同志：
    六月十六日人民日报读者来信栏内刊登吴恒钦同志对西北甘青公路上翻车事件的反映及应注意行车安全的建议，我们认为这是正确的。下面是我们的检讨与答复：
    （一）肇事的车子是一九三六年的吉斯车，车龄相当老，但未超过保用年限，而且经通监理所检验认为合格。肇事后车子的前轮拉杆碰弯，“和尚头”螺丝完好。由此可以证明汽车方向系统机件并无毛病。肇事原因是司机技术不好，为节省汽油关闭电门下坡开得太快所致。事情发生后，当场死亡的五人，均由本部运输公司负责购买棺材，协同死者家属办理埋葬，并经法院判决由运输公司给以安家费用。其余轻重伤者，全部由运输公司负责送至本部交通医院诊治。至目前止，除尚有二人在休养外，其余已全部痊愈出院。
    （二）翻车事件的发生，暴露出我们交通部门所存在的严重不负责任作风和工作制度的不健全。为了惩前毖后，我们已将司机胡定发送法院依法判处。其余如运输公司经理、管理场场长、管理站站长、监理所所长等有关人员，均已进行深刻检讨；并分别给予撤职、记过、批评等处分。
    （三）自五月份起已停止实行节油奖励制度；并已指示各运输公司、各运输站，加强和改善售票和管理制度（有工作组检查）。目前我们正在召开西北区第二届监理会议，这次会议的主要议题就是安全行驶问题，并提出安全行驶的奖励办法。至于吴同志提出兰州车站的作风问题，已令其彻底检查。
    （四）甘青公路甘肃段路面情况不好是实在的，我们已经注意到这个问题，今年准备动员民工，进行一次全面的整修并铺砂。其余几处桥梁及险道，中央人民政府已拨专款，以便进行有重点的整修。
