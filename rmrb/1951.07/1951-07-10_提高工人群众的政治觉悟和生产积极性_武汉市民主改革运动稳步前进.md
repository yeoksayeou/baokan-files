Raising the Political Awareness and Production Enthusiasm of the Working Masses
    Wuhan's Democratic Reform Movement is Steadily Advancing
    Following the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, Wuhan launched a democratic reform movement against feudal "Ba Tou" (foremen/gang leaders) in May. This movement started in large factories and enterprises. Currently, the democratic reform movement has come to an end in Jianghan Shipbuilding Company, Jiji Hydroelectric Power Company, First Cotton Mill, Zhenhuan, Shenxin, Yuhua and other cotton mills; it is underway in railway factories, packing plants, and individual handicraft industries. This movement is led by the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and in each factory, it is led by the Study Committee (because each factory launched this movement on the basis of studying the suppression of counter-revolutionaries) or the Democratic Reform Committee.

    The scope of this democratic reform movement is very broad, not only in public factories and enterprises, but also in joint public-private and private factories and enterprises; not only in factories and enterprises, but also in various industries, handicrafts, and street neighborhoods, making it a city-wide democratic reform movement.

    On June 23, Comrade Zhang Pinghua, Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a report entitled "Struggle to Implement Democratic Reform" at the first meeting of the Second Wuhan Municipal People's Representatives Conference, mobilizing people from all walks of life to carry out the democratic reform movement. The report put forward the scope and steps of "points" (each factory and enterprise), "lines" (each industry), and "surface" (street neighborhoods); the policy direction is "focus on liquidation, handle separately; oppose feudalism, not capital; oppose feudalism, not technology." "Points" and "lines" experiments are now underway to gain experience. During this stage, the First Cotton Mill and Jiji Hydroelectric Power Company have achieved better results.

    The progress of this movement is roughly as follows: cultivate activists in advance, conduct in-depth deliberation; start with small-scale typical demonstrations of accusations, and then promote them to factory-wide accusation struggles; after separate handling, the movement comes to an end for the time being. This can be said to be the first stage of democratic reform. Then, study the Labor Insurance Regulations, conduct labor insurance card registration, deepen democratic reform, and register reactionary party and league members. This stage is still in progress in some places. Finally, carry out criticism and self-criticism, conduct democratic unity movements, and re-elect trade unions, turning to production competitions. (The content of democratic unity is: workers and leaders, workers and staff, and workers criticize and self-criticize each other to achieve internal unity.)

    In this movement, some feudal, reactionary, and corrupt cliques in certain public enterprises were exposed. Before liberation, they monopolized employment and engaged in collective corruption. After liberation, they continued to engage in collective corruption; they even monopolized the election of labor models.

    This movement was launched on the basis of the suppression of counter-revolutionary movement, so workers generally have few ideological concerns, and veteran workers have also been mobilized. After launching the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the First Cotton Mill workers demanded the struggle against feudal forces such as "Ba Tou," and the movement turned to democratic reform. During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the factory struggled against, reported, and detained more than 40 people; in the democratic reform, it struggled against more than 220 people, sent six people to the Public Security Bureau, and expelled six people. After doing this, the political awareness of the workers improved step by step during the movement.

    In some factories, workers had more ideological concerns at the beginning of the movement. For example, the employees of the Jiji Hydroelectric Power Company had three fears at the beginning of the movement: fear of favoritism (some people had relationships with feudal forces), fear of having stains themselves (some people were also members of the corruption group), and fear of retaliation (feudal forces spread rumors and threats). After in-depth deliberation, the workers' thinking was opened up and the masses were mobilized; the number of emerging activists reached a quarter of the total.

    Some factories went astray because they studied the Labor Insurance Regulations from the beginning, treating the implementation of labor insurance as a purely technical work and not combining it with the political movement. For example, Shenxin did this at the beginning, and the workers got stuck in the horns of their own self-interests, only calculating treatment in terms of injury and illness, and ignoring the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and anti-feudalism; they went around in a big circle, and later turned to democratic reform.

    In factories that have undergone this movement, counter-revolutionaries have been largely eliminated; feudal forces have been largely overthrown after several struggles; and the working masses have been mobilized. After the movement in the First Cotton Mill came to an end, a mass summary was carried out among the workers, collectively called "three checks" - check awareness, check policies, and check organization. Two topics were given each day for workers to discuss, and the workers' political and ideological awareness was improved one step further in the summary, and it was further consolidated. The workers more supported and loved the Communist Party, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League. Everyone was very enthusiastic about donating airplanes and artillery. The masses demanded that feudal elements be assigned to their own groups for control and labor reform. When donating airplanes and artillery, some groups said to the "Ba Tou": "If we weren't liberated, wouldn't these things have been snatched away by you? Now that we have turned over, we will donate these things to buy airplanes and artillery to fight the American devils!" However, some factories have not done well. For example, in the Zhenhuan Cotton Mill, the leadership was weak, and they committed the mistake of being too hasty, so the movement did not go well; some workers who were already considered "activists" still did not know why they were struggling. It is necessary to continue to mobilize the masses in depth.

    At present, the democratic reform movement in Wuhan is expanding to various industries under the Industry Trade Union.

　　提高工人群众的政治觉悟和生产积极性
    武汉市民主改革运动稳步前进
    武汉市接着镇压反革命运动之后，于五月间开始展开了反封建把头的民主改革运动。这个运动，首先是在大的工厂企业中开展。目前江汉船舶公司，既济水电公司，第一纱厂，震寰、申新、裕华等纱厂，民主改革运动已告一段落；铁路工厂、打包厂以及个别的手工业行业正在进行。这个运动是由中国共产党武汉市委领导，在各厂是由学习委员会（因为各厂在学习镇压反革命的基础上开展这一运动）或民主改革委员会领导。
    这一民主改革运动的范围很广，不仅在公营工厂企业，而且在公私合营以及私营的工厂企业也同时进行；不仅在工厂企业，而且在各种行业、手工业，以及街道里巷也要进行，因而是整个城市的民主改革运动。
    六月二十三日，中国共产党武汉市委书记张平化同志在武汉市第二届第一次各界人民代表会议上作了《为贯彻民主改革而斗争》的报告，通过代表会议动员各界人民开展民主改革运动。报告中提出了“点”（各工厂企业）、“线”（各行业）、“面”（街道里巷）的范围与步骤；政策方针是“重点清算，分别处理；反封建，不反资本；反封建，不反技术”。现在正在进行“点”与“线”的试验，以取得经验。在这一阶段中，成绩较好的是第一纱厂和既济水电公司。
    这次运动的进展情况，大体上是：事先培养积极分子，深入酝酿；从典型示范的小控诉开始，再推行到全厂性的控诉斗争；到分别处理以后告一段落。这可以说是民主改革的第一阶段。接着是学习劳动保险条例，进行劳动保险卡片登记，深入进行民主改革，登记反动党、团分子。这一阶段有的正在进行。最后是开展批评与自我批评，进行民主团结运动和改选工会，转向生产竞赛。（民主团结的内容是：工人与领导干部、工人与职员、工人与工人互相间展开批评和自我批评，达到内部的团结。）
    在这运动中暴露出了某些公营企业中的封建、反动、贪污的小集团，他们在解放前包办用人，集体贪污，解放后仍进行集体贪污；甚至包办选举劳动模范。
    这一运动是在镇压反革命运动的基础上开展起来的，所以工人的思想顾虑一般的不大，老工人也发动起来了。第一纱厂在开展镇压反革命运动后，工人即要求斗争把头等封建势力，运动就转入了民主改革。该厂在镇压反革命时，斗争、检举、扣押了四十余人；在民主改革中，斗争了二百二十余人，有六人送公安局，六人开除了。这样做了之后，工人政治觉悟在运动中一步步提高起来。
    也有的厂在运动开始时，工人思想顾虑是较多的。如既济水电公司职工，在运动开始时有三怕：怕情面（有的人与封建势力有关系），怕自己有污点（有的人也是贪污集团的一分子），怕报复（封建势力造谣威胁）。经过深入酝酿，才打通了群众思想，把群众发动起来；出现的积极分子达总人数的四分之一。
    有的厂因一开始就学习劳动保险条例，把实行劳动保险当作单纯技术工作，不结合政治运动进行，就走了弯路。如申新一开始就是这样做的，工人就钻了切身利益的牛角尖，只是计算伤病方面的待遇，而忽略了镇压反革命与反封建；绕了一个大圈子，到后来才转到民主改革。
    经过这次运动的工厂，反革命分子大体上是肃清了；经过好几次的斗争，封建势力大体上被斗倒了；工人群众发动起来了。第一纱厂运动告一段落后，在工人中又开展了群众性的总结，总称“三查”——查觉悟，查政策，查组织。每天出两个题目，由工人讨论，把工人的政治思想觉悟，在总结中提高了一步，而且更加巩固起来。工人对共产党、对工会、对青年团更加拥护和爱戴了。大家对捐献飞机大炮很是踊跃。群众要求把封建分子分配到自己的小组去，以便管制和劳动改造。有的小组在捐献飞机大炮时，对把头说：“如果不解放，我们这些东西还不是叫你抢夺去？现在我们翻身了，这些东西我们要捐献出去买飞机大炮打美国鬼子去了！”但，也有的厂还作得不好。如震寰纱厂，因领导较弱，又犯了急性病，运动开展得不好；有的工人已经被认为是“积极分子”了，还不知道为什么要斗争。继续深入发动群众是很必要的。
    目前，武汉市民主改革运动，正在扩展到行业工会所属各行业中去。
