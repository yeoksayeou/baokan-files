　　Su'nan District, Nanhui County, Maoxin Yarn Factory Workers
    Warmly Welcome Farmer Brothers to Sell Cotton
    Maoxin Yarn Factory in Zhoupu Town, Nanhui County, Su'nan District, has been shut down for a long time due to a lack of cotton. On July 3rd, when the factory workers heard that farmers from Yibei Township in the county had brought more than 400 bales of cotton to sell to the Zhoupu Town Cooperative to support the worker brothers and solve the production difficulties, everyone was very happy and organized a military band and waist drum team to welcome them. They passed in front of the Zhoupu Town Cooperative and saw farmers from all over carrying bales of cotton, some weighing thirty or forty catties, and some weighing seven or eight catties, all selling to the cooperative. The workers' team arrived at the Zhoupu Town pier, and soon they saw the large boat of farmers from Yibei Township, loaded with cotton, arriving led by a township cadre. The workers were indescribably happy, and they beat waist drums and played music to express their warm welcome. The worker brothers and farmer brothers shook hands tightly. In the conversation, both sides put forward guarantees for increasing production and supporting each other:

    The township cadre, representing the farmers, said: "The factory lacks cotton, and it is our farmers' responsibility to support it, so as not to shut down the factory. When we started mobilizing the sale and storage of cotton, the farmers in our township did not have a clear understanding of this matter. After repeated publicity and explanation, everyone realized the task of patriotic cotton sales and storage. So far, more than 400 bales have been sold; but it is now estimated that there are still more than 200 bales of cotton in the homes of farmers. Today, I will guarantee to mobilize the farmer brothers to sell all of them as soon as possible. In order to further resist the US and aid Korea, our township also guarantees to harvest 140 catties per mu for 'dry rice field' cotton and 120 catties per mu for 'wheat field' cotton. We will take practical actions to complete the glorious task of increasing cotton production and supporting the factory, in order to crush the blockade of US imperialism."

    The worker comrades in the yarn factory also proposed to guarantee that during the shutdown period, they would study politics and technology hard, welcome the autumn production surge, support the countryside, increase production, and donate airplanes and cannons.

　　苏南区南汇县茂新纱厂工人
    热烈欢迎农民弟兄售棉
    苏南区南汇县周浦镇茂新纱厂，因为棉花缺乏，已经停工很久了。七月三日那天，纱厂工人听说该县怡北乡的农民带了四百多包棉花售给周浦镇合作社，来支援工人弟兄解决生产的困难，大家都非常高兴，就把军乐队、腰鼓队组织起来，前去欢迎。他们经过周浦镇合作社门前，看见四乡的农民带着一包一包的棉花，三、四十斤也有，七、八斤的也有，都在向合作社出售。工人的队伍到了周浦镇码头，不久，就看见怡北乡农民的满载着棉花的大船，由一个乡干部带领着来了。工人们心中真有说不出的高兴，他们打起腰鼓，奏起乐曲热烈地表示欢迎。工人弟兄和农民弟兄紧紧地握起手来。在谈话中，双方提出了增加生产，互相支援的保证：
    乡干部代表农民说：“工厂缺少棉花，我们农民就有责任支援，不使工厂停工。在开始动员售棉储棉时，我们乡的农民对这事还认识不清，经过多次宣传解释，大家对爱国售棉储棉的任务都认识到了，到目前为止，已经出售了四百多包；但现在估计，仍还有二百多包棉花存在农民家中，今天我回去保证动员农民兄弟赶快全部售出。为了进一步抗美援朝，我们乡里还保证‘旱稻田’花每亩收一百四十斤，‘小麦田’花每亩收一百二十斤。以实际行动完成增产棉花、支援工厂的光荣任务，来粉碎美帝国主义的封锁。”
    纱厂里的工人同志们也提出，保证在停工期中，努力学习政治，学习技术，迎接秋季大生产，支援农村，增产捐献飞机大炮。
