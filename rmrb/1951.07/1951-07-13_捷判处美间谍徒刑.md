Xinhua News Agency, July 11th: According to TASS, the Czechoslovakian State Court recently tried William Oatis, an American Associated Press reporter stationed in Prague, for espionage activities, along with his accomplices, Czechoslovakian employees Svorboda, Vojtínek, and Munkz. The trial of Oatis revealed the insidious behavior of American imperialist spies. Oatis confessed that he specialized in collecting information on Czechoslovakia's border defenses, the location, organization, equipment, and training of troops, the location of heavy industrial factories, aviation and railway lines, and the appointment and removal of personnel in government departments. He and his "reporters" published articles in bourgeois newspapers, using coded language to transmit intelligence to American intelligence agencies. Oatis also confessed that spies also engaged in espionage activities under the guise of Reuters and United Press reporters. Oatis also named several diplomats involved in espionage activities, such as US Ambassador to Prague Briggs, Counselor Thompson, First Secretary Hine, Military Attaché Atwood, British Embassy Military Attaché Wheeler, and British Information Officer Snigro.

The accomplices in this case, Svorboda and the other two, confessed to the crime of collecting various intelligence reports under the orders of Oatis and other Associated Press "reporters." Vojtínek also confessed to collecting rumors defaming the Czechoslovak Republic and supplying them to the Prague branch of the Associated Press. These materials were used by foreign propaganda organs to conduct propaganda against the Czechoslovak people.

The court heard the testimony of eleven witnesses and the final statements of the defendants. At the sentencing on the 4th, the defendants were found guilty of espionage and sentenced Oatis to ten years in prison, and Svorboda and the other two defendants to imprisonment ranging from twenty to sixteen years. All defendants were deprived of their civil rights, and their property was confiscated.
