Xinhua News Agency, London, July 17th: News: The former British Labour Minister, leader of the so-called "left-wing group" within the Labour Party, Bevan, and his followers in Parliament, the former Trade Minister Wilson, the former Under-Secretary of the Supply Ministry Freeman, and more than twenty others, published a pamphlet entitled "Only One Way" on July 10th, criticizing the Attlee government's policies. This Labour Party politician, known for his cunning and hypocrisy, took this new action after resigning from the government in late April, with the aim of competing with Attlee for the leadership of the Labour Party at the Labour Party's annual conference scheduled for October. However, the content of this pamphlet also reflects the strong dissatisfaction of the British people and the vast number of Labour Party members with the Labour government's war preparation policy and the serious division within the Labour Party leadership group.

In their pamphlet, the Bevan group admits that what the British people hate most today is the American policy of trying to provoke a world war around the world, the British government's servile submission to the United States, the unprecedented disaster caused to the British economy by the war preparation policy implemented by Britain under the command of the United States, and the arming of German and Spanish fascists. Therefore, Bevan had to put forward some proposals in his pamphlet that attempted to cater to the British people's and the ordinary Labour Party members' demands for peace and independence. The pamphlet emphasizes that Britain should ask the United States to calmly consider certain key issues related to war and peace. It openly criticizes the Attlee government's policy of excessively following the United States, calls for "a comprehensive review of British-American relations," and adopts a "proactive and independent policy" in relations with the United States. Regarding the current arms expansion and war preparation movement, although Bevan's pamphlet says on the one hand that this is necessary, on the other hand, it has to admit that the burden on the British economy is too heavy, and that the United States' war preparation activities around the world have damaged the economy of Britain and the entire capitalist world. If this continues, the United States will become the greatest threat to world peace. In addition, it also proposes that there is no need to insist on rearming Germany or having Franco's Spain join the North Atlantic Treaty.

Although Bevan said some things to win popular support, he still cannot help but expose his reactionary essence. While talking about "restraining the United States" to ensure peace, he continues to support the North Atlantic aggressive alliance formed single-handedly by US imperialism, and supports the United States in owning military bases in Britain. At the same time, Bevan also blatantly demanded to ensure full military supplies to the Yugoslav Tito bandit gang. In this way, Bevan showed that he and Attlee are just birds of a feather.

　　英工党领导集团日趋分裂
　  比万等人公开抨击政府备战政策
　  企图笼络人心与艾德礼争领导权
    【新华社十七日讯】伦敦消息：前英国劳工大臣，工党内所谓“左翼集团”的首领比万及其在议会中的追随者前贸易大臣威尔逊、前供应部次官福里曼等二十余人，在七月十日发表了题为《只有一条路》的小册子，对艾德礼政府政策提出批评。这个以奸诈和伪善闻名的工党政客，继四月下旬退出政府后所采取的这一新的行动，其目的是要在定于十月召开的工党年会上，与艾德礼争夺工党的领导权，但是这本小册子的内容却也同时反映了英国人民和工党广大党员对工党政府备战政策的强烈不满和工党领导集团内部的严重分裂。
    比万集团在其小册子中承认：英国人民今天最痛恨的是美国想在全世界挑起世界大战的政策，是英国政府对美国奴颜婢膝的屈服，是英国在美国命令下所实行的备战政策对英国经济造成的空前灾难，是对德国与西班牙法西斯的武装。因此，比万在其小册子中不得不提出一些企图迎合英国人民和工党普通党员要求和平与独立的情绪的主张。该小册子强调英国应要求美国冷静地考虑某些有关和战关键的问题。它公开抨击艾德礼政府过分追随美国的政策，要求“对英美关系作一次全面检查”，并在对美关系上采取“主动而独立的政策”。对于目前的扩军备战运动，比万的小册子虽然一方面说这是必要的，一方面却不得不承认它对英国经济的负担过分沉重，承认美国在全世界的备战活动，已经损害了英国和整个资本主义世界的经济，这样继续下去，美国将成为对世界和平的最大威胁。此外它还提出，可以无须坚持重新武装德国或使佛朗哥西班牙参加北大西洋公约。
    比万虽然说出了这么一些笼络人心的话，但是仍然不能不暴露出他的反动本质。他一面谈论“约束美国”以保障和平，一面却继续拥护以美帝国主义所一手组成的北大西洋侵略联盟，赞成美国在英国拥有军事基地。比万同时还露骨地要求保证给南斯拉夫铁托匪帮以充分的军事供应。这样，比万就表明他和艾德礼不过是一丘之貉而已。
