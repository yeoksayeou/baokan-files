　　Beijing's No. 19 Wofosi Street Courtyard
　　New Atmosphere After Adopting Patriotic Pact
    This courtyard was originally noisy, chaotic, and unclean; now it has become united and mutually helpful, clean, with busy work and attention to national affairs.

    Since adopting a patriotic pact, the No. 19 Wofosi Street Courtyard in the Second District of Beijing has shown a new atmosphere.

    This courtyard has a total of eighteen households and seventy-nine people; including four monks (the courtyard was originally a temple), twenty housewives, and twenty-eight children; most of the others are laborers and small traders. There are two military dependents' families in the courtyard. Their patriotic pact was formulated after discussion by everyone, promoted by the activists in the courtyard, such as Chen Boqin. After careful and detailed discussions, they had a preliminary understanding of the significance of formulating a patriotic pact, and combined it with their own lives to propose and discuss the specific content of the patriotic pact. The eight articles of the patriotic pact they passed are: (1) Study hard and establish a reading group; (2) Do not be late or leave early for meetings; (3) Maintain cleanliness inside and outside the courtyard, and pay attention to physical health; (4) Raise vigilance, pay attention to fire prevention, theft prevention, and anti-espionage; (5) Practice thrift, increase production, and support the front; (6) Do not fail to report household registration, and report bad people; (7) Strengthen unity and do not cause disagreements; (8) Do not believe rumors, and be able to trace the source of rumors.

    The day after the patriotic pact was established, Chen Boqin immediately proposed the establishment of a reading group to everyone. The residents happily pooled more than 50,000 yuan according to their economic situation and subscribed to two newspapers. They decided that from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM every day, the monk Chunbao would read the newspaper to the residents who were not out working. The old ladies brought needlework to do while listening to the newspaper, which did not delay production. Everyone was very interested, and after listening, they discussed it in twos and threes. During the May Festival, the reader asked everyone if they wanted to rest for a day. The old ladies said: "Don't rest, we are listening to it just fine, why rest?"

    After having a reading group, everyone not only studied current affairs regularly, but also learned from the experience of implementing patriotic pacts in other places; everyone's enthusiasm was very high. The activists took on the responsibility again, regularly checking the implementation of the patriotic pact, seizing specific examples in a timely manner, and carrying out commendation and criticism; and deeply publicized the significance of the patriotic pact. Therefore, the patriotic pact has improved the political awareness of the residents of the courtyard, strengthened unity, and renewed the atmosphere of the courtyard.

    In the past, many residents of the courtyard were not interested in political activities. When it was necessary to convene a meeting of the residents in the courtyard, some people were unwilling to come even after being invited several times, and even said some harsh words to satirize the activists; many people who went to the meeting just went to sit and cope. After the patriotic pact was established, the situation was completely different. Before the reading time arrived, everyone came early; as long as a child called out for a meeting, everyone would go to the meeting place. After the movement to donate airplanes and cannons was launched, the whole courtyard responded enthusiastically. The housewives also organized themselves to go to the factory to find work; they donated one day's wages every week. They also paid more attention to fire prevention, theft prevention, and anti-espionage work. Everyone stipulated that the stove should be placed in a certain place, and it must be extinguished before going to bed. In the past, there were many idlers coming in and out of the courtyard, and everyone did not know them or ask questions; now when they see strangers, they ask where they are going.

    In the past, many neighbors in the courtyard did not speak when they met; some even had disagreements with each other; after establishing the patriotic pact, everyone strengthened unity and could help each other. For example, if someone went out to a meeting or had other things to do, others would help them cook and take care of the children. In the past, each household only took care of sweeping in front of their own house, and no one cared about the courtyard, toilets, corners, etc., and the sanitation was very bad; now they have established a rotating duty system to manage sanitation and keep the courtyard clean. Everyone also cares more about the two military dependents' families in the courtyard; often helping them fetch water and do work.

    I went to the courtyard one evening in mid-June and talked to the residents. They said: After signing the patriotic pact, we feel that life is more meaningful and happier.

　　北京市卧佛寺街十九号大杂院
　　订立爱国公约后出现了新气象
    这个大杂院原来是吵闹、杂乱、不清洁的；现在变得团结互助、清洁、工作紧张和注意国家大事了。
    北京市第二区卧佛寺街十九号大杂院订立爱国公约后，已经出现了新的气象。
    这个大杂院共有十八户、七十九人；其中有四个和尚（该院原是寺庙），二十个家庭妇女，二十八个儿童；其他大部分是做小工的和做小买卖的。院中有两户是军属。他们的爱国公约是在该院积极分子陈伯琴等推动下，经过大家讨论订出的。他们经过认真仔细的讨论，对订立爱国公约的意义有了初步的认识，结合着自己的生活提出并讨论了爱国公约的具体内容。他们通过的爱国公约共八条：（一）努力学习，建立读报组；（二）开会不迟到、不早退；（三）保持院内外清洁，注意身体健康；（四）提高警惕，注意防火、防盗、防特务；（五）实行节约，增加生产，支援前线；（六）不漏报户口，检举坏人；（七）加强团结，不闹意见；（八）不信谣言，并能追查谣言来源。
    订立爱国公约的第二天，陈伯琴立刻向大家提出成立读报组的事情。居民们愉快地根据自己的经济情况凑了五万多元钱，订了两份报纸。他们决定每天下午二时至四时由和尚纯保向不出去做活的居民读报。老大娘们在听报时都带着针线活做，也不耽误生产。大家兴趣很高，听过之后还三三两两地进行讨论。过五月节时，读报员问大家是否要休息一天。老大娘们说：“可别休息，听得正好着呢，干吗休息呀？”
    有了读报组后，大家不但经常学习时事，并且还学习了其他地方执行爱国公约的经验；情绪都很高。积极分子们又负起责任，经常检查爱国公约执行的情形，及时抓住具体事例，进行表扬和批评；并深入地宣传爱国公约的意义。因此，爱国公约已经使大杂院的居民提高了政治觉悟，加强了团结，使大杂院的气象为之一新。
    过去大杂院很多居民，对政治活动不感兴趣。要召集院里的居民开会时，有些人请了好几次还不愿来，还要说些难听的话，来讽刺积极分子；很多去开会的人也只是去坐坐应付应付。爱国公约订立后，情况完全不同了。读报时间还没有到，大家都早来了；开会只要叫一个孩子嚷一下，大家就都到开会的地方去。捐献飞机大炮运动展开后，全院都热烈响应。家庭妇女们也组织起来，到工厂去揽活做；每星期拿出一天的工资来捐献。他们对防火、防盗、防特务的工作也提高了注意。大家规定了要把炉子放在一定的地方，睡觉前一定把它熄灭。该院过去进出闲人很多，大家不认识也不问；现在看见有生人就问清他到那里去。
    在过去，院里邻居很多人见了面还不说话；有的甚至相互闹意气；立爱国公约后，大家加强了团结，并能互相帮助。如有人出去开会或有其他事情，别人就帮他做饭、看孩子。过去每一家都只顾打扫自己家门口，院子、厕所、墙角等处都没人管，卫生情况很坏；现在他们已建立轮流值日管理卫生的制度，把院子打扫得干干净净的。大家对院子里的两户军属，也关心得多了；常常帮他们打水、做活。
    我在六月中旬晚上曾到该院和居民们谈话。他们说：订了爱国公约后，我们感到生活更有意义，更愉快了。
