　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 6th: The Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on June 21st, resolutely opposing the lifting of purges against aggressors. The statement condemned the Yoshida government's measure of lifting the purges against aggressors as a violation of the principles of the Potsdam Declaration. The statement pointed out that those whose purges have been lifted are leaders of fascist organizations, fascist politicians colluding with warlords, and financial magnates who engaged in rampant activities to extract resources from China and Southeast Asian countries during the war. Lifting the purges against them is an attempt to promote a separate peace treaty, plotting to arm Japan, and preparing to launch a new war.

　　The statement also pointed out that while the Yoshida government has lifted the purges of the leaders who drove the masses into the war of aggression, it has not taken any measures to lift the purges of all the illegally purged Central Committee members of the JCP and the famous democratic activist Matsumoto Jiichiro. The statement stated that the Japanese Communist Party will not back down and is determined to fight for the implementation of the Potsdam Declaration and the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan.

　　日共声明反对解除侵略分子整肃
    痛斥吉田政府单独媾和武装日本阴谋
    表示坚决为争取缔结全面和约而斗争
    【新华社六日讯】东京消息：日本共产党曾在六月二十一日发表声明，坚决反对解除侵略分子的整肃处分。声明斥责吉田政府对侵略分子解除整肃的措施违反波茨坦公告的原则。声明指出：被解除整肃的人物都是法西斯团体的领袖、与军阀相勾结的法西斯政客以及战时为榨取中国和东南亚各国而大肆活动的财阀。对他们解除整肃是企图促成单独媾和，阴谋武装日本，准备发动新战争。
    声明同时指出：吉田政府一方面解除了驱使人民大众进行侵略战争的领导者的整肃处分，另一方面却对被非法整肃的日共全体中央委员以及著名民主运动者松本治一郎丝毫没有采取任何措施，以解除他们的整肃。声明表示：日本共产党决不退缩，坚决为履行波茨坦公告和缔结全面对日和约而斗争。
