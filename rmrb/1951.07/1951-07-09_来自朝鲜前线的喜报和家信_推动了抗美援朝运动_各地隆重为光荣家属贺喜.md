　　Xinhua News Agency, July 7th—Good news and letters from the Korean front have been continuously arriving to the families of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers across the country. Local people have held grand celebration rallies to congratulate the honored military families. These good news reports and letters have further inspired the enthusiasm of people in various regions to resist America and aid Korea. When the good news reports, citations, and letters from home of Volunteer Army soldiers Wang Bin and Xia Baiwan reached Feixi County in the Wanbei District of Anhui Province, the county was holding a county-wide representative meeting for resisting America and aiding Korea. Wang Xianming and Xia Benqian, the family members of the two meritorious soldiers who were attending the conference, received warm congratulations from more than 670 people's representatives from the county at the meeting. On June 21st, a grand county-wide celebration rally was held. County Chief He Zhenli personally presented the good news reports, citations, and banners donated by the Wanbei Resist America, Aid Korea Branch, the Feixi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Feixi County People's Government, and people's organizations to the families of the two meritorious soldiers. In the evening, the representative meeting also held a grand banquet.
　　The Resist America, Aid Korea Branch of the Subei District received 176 good news reports and citations in late June. On June 30th, the first representative meeting of people from all walks of life in the Subei District to resist America and aid Korea solemnly held a ceremony to congratulate the families of the meritorious soldiers of the Volunteer Army. The chairman of the meeting presented two framed good news reports and two banners to the families of two meritorious soldiers. One was Zhao Xingguang, the father of Zhao Bin, a second-class meritorious soldier of the Volunteer Army, and the other was Liu Sheshi, the mother of Liu Guangxiong, a third-class meritorious soldier. Students from Yangzhou Middle School organized a hundred-person waist drum team and came to present flowers to the families of the meritorious soldiers. In the congratulatory speech, the representative of the Resist America, Aid Korea Branch of the Subei District stated: Our people of Subei will use the practical actions of donating 35 airplanes and doing a good job in preferential treatment to celebrate the achievements of the glorious families of meritorious soldiers.
　　The good news report of Volunteer Army anti-aircraft gunner Fan Xingfa (original name Zhuang Yunxi) shooting down three enemy planes reached the Jiangyin Huilun Cloth Factory where his sister, Zhuang Ermei, worked. On the same day, the workers went to Fan Xingfa's home in Liucai Bridge outside the east gate of Jiangyin to congratulate him. Zhuang Ermei wrote a letter to her brother, expressing her determination to work hard in production and fully support the front.
　　The good news that Volunteer Army soldier Wang Zhilong won a first-class merit, after being sent out by Xinhua News Agency on June 6th, reached his hometown of Liujie Township in Guan County, Western Sichuan. The town of Liujie Township immediately posted a large red good news report, and the local people went to Wang Zhilong's home to congratulate him. On the 13th, the township people's government specially held a mass rally to celebrate Wang Zhilong's merits. The county magistrate of Guan County and representatives of people from all walks of life in the county also brought letters of condolences and gifts, and went to Wang Zhilong's home to congratulate him amid the sound of gongs and drums. Wang Zhilong's mother said with emotion: "This is the greatest happy event that my family has never had in three generations!" She immediately wrote a letter to her son, encouraging him to make more contributions in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement.
　　Letters from Volunteer Army soldiers to the people of the motherland have also been continuously sent to various places. After the people of Tunxi City in Southern Anhui received a letter from a Volunteer Army soldier, the blackboard newspapers in every factory, school, organization, and street in the city immediately published it in a prominent position. This letter from the battlefield inspired the enthusiasm of people from all walks of life in the city to resist America and aid Korea. The workers of the Tunxi Automobile Maintenance Yard of the Southern Anhui Transportation Company immediately formulated a plan to increase production and donate airplanes and artillery. More than 250 middle school students automatically signed up to participate in the "Sunday Voluntary Labor Team" to dedicate all their labor income to buying airplanes and artillery.

    各地隆重为光荣家属贺喜
    【新华社七日讯】各地志愿军军人家属，最近陆续收到许多来自朝鲜前线的立功喜报、家信。各地人民并举行了隆重的贺功大会，为光荣的军属们贺喜。这些喜报与信件进一步地鼓舞了各地人民抗美援朝的热情。当志愿军战士王斌与夏百万的立功喜报、奖状与家信送到皖北区肥西县时，该县正在召开全县抗美援朝代表会议。正在出席大会的两位功臣的家属王先明、夏本谦，在会上受到了全县六百七十多位人民代表热情的庆贺。六月二十一日又隆重举行了全县贺功大会。县长何真理在会上亲自将立功喜报、奖状，及皖北抗美援朝分会、中共肥西县委员会、肥西县人民政府、各界人民团体等赠送的锦旗，授予两位功臣家属。晚间，代表会议又举行了盛大的宴会。
    苏北区抗美援朝分会于六月下旬接到喜报与奖状一百七十六份。六月三十日，苏北区第一次各界人民抗美援朝代表会议，隆重举行了向志愿军功臣家属庆贺的仪式。大会主席将装在镜框里的两张喜报，和两面锦旗，授予两位功臣家属。一位是志愿军二等功臣赵斌的父亲赵杏广，一位是三等功臣刘光雄的母亲刘佘氏。扬州中学学生组织了百人腰鼓队，赶来向功臣家属献花。苏北区抗美援朝分会代表致贺词中称：我们苏北人民将用捐献飞机三十五架、作好优抚工作的实际行动，来为光荣的功臣家属们庆功。
    志愿军高射炮手范兴发（原名庄云熙）打落三架敌机的立功喜报，传到了他姊姊庄二妹工作的江阴汇纶布厂。当天，工人们纷纷到江阴东门外留彩桥范兴发家里去贺喜。庄二妹写了书信给她弟弟，表示一定努力生产，全力支援前方。
    志愿军战士王治龙荣获一等功的喜讯，经新华社六月六日发出后，传到了他的家乡川西灌县柳街乡。柳街乡镇上立刻贴出大红喜报，当地人民纷纷前往王治龙家中去贺喜。十三日，乡人民政府特地召开群众大会为王治龙庆功。灌县县长及县各界人民代表也带了慰问信件和礼物，在锣鼓声中前往王治龙家中贺喜，王治龙的母亲感动地说：“这是我家祖宗三代从来没有过的大喜事！”她当即给儿子写了一封信，勉励他在抗美援朝运动中功上加功。
    志愿军战士们给祖国人民的信件也陆续送到各地。皖南屯溪市人民收到一位志愿军战士的来信后，市区的每个工厂、学校、机关和每条街道的黑板报立即都在显著的地位把它刊登出来。这封来自战地的信件鼓舞了该市各阶层人民抗美援朝的热情。皖南运输公司屯溪汽车保养场的工人立即订出增产捐献飞机大炮的计划。二百五十多个中学生自动报名参加“星期日义务劳动队”，以全部劳动收入致献购买飞机大炮。
