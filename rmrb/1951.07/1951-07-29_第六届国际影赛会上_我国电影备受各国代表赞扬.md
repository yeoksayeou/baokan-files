　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 28th: Since the opening of the Sixth International Film Festival in Karlovy Vary, Czechoslovakia, on the 14th, more than 30 feature films have been screened. Chinese films have been universally praised at the film festival, with many believing that Chinese cinema has made remarkable progress in the past year or so. On the evening of the 21st, the feature film "The White Haired Girl" was screened, and the theater was packed with people. Many others outside the theater negotiated to enter and watch while standing. After watching the film, Czechoslovakian Minister of Culture and Propaganda, Kopecki, excitedly said: "This film is not only full of poetry and beautiful folk songs, allowing people to appreciate China's long history of culture and art, but it also cleverly uses folk legends to movingly depict the history of the Chinese peasants' arduous struggle under the oppression of the feudal system. I am convinced that in today's struggle against American imperialism, the Chinese peasants will continue to display their spirit of perseverance and tenacity." The head of the Soviet delegation, Seminove, said: "The future development of Chinese cinema is unlimited, as New China has so many excellent and talented directors and actors." After the screening, many viewers surrounded the Chinese representatives, using expressions and gestures to express their love for this film with rich national characteristics.

　　The feature film "Steel Soldiers," which achieved great success at the film festival, was shown five times a day at the Mariánské Lázně Workers' Film Festival, and each screening was sold out. When it was screened at the open-air cinema in Karlovy Vary, there were more than 3,000 spectators at one screening. News briefings and documentary shorts about the Korean War were also well received, especially the film "Great Unity of the Chinese Nation," which was extremely popular among the audience.

　　At a joint gathering, representatives from various people's democratic countries expressed their admiration for the level reached by the New China's film industry in such a short period. In addition, progressive filmmakers from Italy, France, Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, and other countries expressed their particular desire to have New China's films exported to their countries for screening, believing that this would inspire the struggles of their own people.

　　The film festival is scheduled to close on the 28th and hold an awards ceremony. Chinese representatives Shi Dongshan and Zhang Shuihua have been selected as members of the film festival's judging committee.

　　第六届国际影赛会上
　  我国电影备受各国代表赞扬
    【新华社布拉格二十八日电】在捷克的卡罗维发利城举行的第六届国际电影赛会从十四日开幕以来，已放映了三十多部故事片。新中国电影在电影赛会中已受到普遍的赞扬，大家认为一年多来新中国电影已有突飞猛进的发展。二十一日晚放映的故事片《白毛女》，场内坐满了人，场外还有许多人交涉进场去站着看。捷克斯洛伐克文化宣传部长柯柏斯基看完以后兴奋地说：“这部影片不仅充满了诗意和幽美的民歌，令人体会到中国悠久的文化和艺术，并且巧妙地引用了民间传奇，动人地刻划出中国农民在封建制度压迫下艰苦斗争的史迹。我确信在今天反对美帝国主义的斗争中，中国农民必将继续发挥他们这种坚忍不屈的顽强精神。”苏联代表团团长赛米诺夫说：“新中国有那么多优秀的有才能的导演和演员，中国电影事业的发展前途是不可限量的。”散场后许多观众围着中国代表，用表情和手势来表达他们热爱这部富有民族色彩的电影的情绪。
    在电影赛会上获得极大成功的故事片《钢铁战士》，在马利安斯基温泉工人电影节放映时，一天连演五场都告客满，在卡罗维发利的露天电影场放映时，一场就有三千多观众。有关朝鲜战况的简报和纪录短片，也同样受到欢迎，特别是《中华民族大团结》一片极为观众喜爱。
    各人民民主国家代表在一次联欢座谈会上，对新中国电影事业在短短时期中所达到的水准都表示钦佩。此外，意、法、澳、比、荷等国的进步电影工作者特别殷切希望新中国影片能输往他们的国家放映，他们认为这样会鼓舞他们本国人民的斗争。
    本届赛会定于二十八日闭幕，并举行授奖仪式。我国代表史东山和张水华已被选为电影赛会评判委员会委员。
