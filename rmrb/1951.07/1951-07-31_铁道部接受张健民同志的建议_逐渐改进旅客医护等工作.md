Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

  　Ministry of Railways Accepts Comrade Zhang Jianmin's Suggestions
　　Gradually Improving Passenger Medical Care and Other Services
To the Editors:
    The three suggestions made by Comrade Zhang Jianmin regarding the People's Railways, published in the "Reader's Letters" section of the People's Daily on June 20th, are basically correct. We are paying attention to these issues and are finding ways to improve them. The following is a breakdown:
    1.  Regarding the medical treatment of passengers who become temporarily ill during their journey: Currently, in addition to some trains in the Northeast region having medical personnel, all other regions have set up first-aid kits on trains and trained train attendants to provide temporary first aid. For more complex illnesses, the patient can be sent to a hospital for treatment after the train arrives at a station with a hospital. Since the implementation of compulsory passenger accident insurance on July 1st, the medicines in the first-aid kits have been replenished. These measures are, of course, not perfect, but it is currently difficult to add medical personnel to all trains across the country.
    2.  Regarding the high cost of food in dining cars: Currently, the food sold in dining cars is priced similarly to the same food sold in restaurants in major cities; in some cases, it is even lower. For example, the price of a Chinese set meal in a dining car is between 3,000 and 4,000 yuan, while the price in a general restaurant in Beijing is mostly 3,500 yuan. However, the food currently provided in dining cars does not meet the demand for affordable prices from the general public. In the future, we should try to provide food that the general public needs and strive to reduce costs and lower prices. We are now strengthening the management of dining cars to achieve these goals.
    3.  Regarding the overcrowding in carriages: Currently, only a few trains implement reserved seating. Due to the shortage of passenger cars, limiting the number of tickets sold at stations would inconvenience passengers who urgently need to travel. Therefore, most trains cannot currently guarantee everyone a seat. In the future, we will strengthen our understanding of transportation conditions, add passenger cars in a timely manner, and gradually implement reserved seating or boarding.

### 铁道部接受张健民同志的建议　逐渐改进旅客医护等工作

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

  　铁道部接受张健民同志的建议
　　逐渐改进旅客医护等工作编辑同志：
    六月二十日人民日报《读者来信专页》刊登的张健民同志对人民铁路提出的三点建议，基本上是正确的，我们正在重视这些工作并设法改善中。兹分项说明如下：
    一、关于乘车旅客，临时得了病的医治问题：现在除东北地区部分列车已设有医务人员外，其他各地均在列车内设置救急药箱，并训练列车员担任临时救护工作。比较复杂的病症，可于列车到达设有医院的车站后，送医院治疗。七月一日开始实行旅客意外伤害强制保险以来，救急药箱之药品已经加以充实。这些措施，当然不够完善，不过在全国各列车一律添设医务人员，目前尚难办到。
    二、关于餐车饮食较贵的问题：现在餐车所售的食品，与各主要城市的饭馆所售的同样食品相比较，其价格相差无几，有的还低于城市中饭馆所售食品的价格。以中餐客饭而论，餐车售价为三千元至四千元，而北京市一般饭馆的售价多为三千五百元。不过目前餐车所供应的食品，的确未能满足一般群众的廉价要求。今后应尽量供应广大群众所需要的食品，并力求减少成本，降低价格。我们现在正加强餐车的管理，以达到以上的目的。
    三、关于车内拥挤问题：现在除有几个列车实行了对号入座外，由于客车不敷应用，在这种情况下如限制车站售票数额，就会使急欲乘车的旅客感到不便，因此，目前大多数列车尚不能保证每个人有一个座位。今后我们要加强掌握运送情况，及时增挂客车，并逐步地办理对号入车或对号入座。
