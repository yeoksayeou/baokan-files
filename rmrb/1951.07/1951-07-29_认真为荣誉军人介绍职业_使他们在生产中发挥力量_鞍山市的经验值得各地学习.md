　　Earnestly Introduce Occupations to Honored Veterans
　  Enabling Them to Exert Their Strength in Production
　  The Experience of Anshan City is Worthy of Learning from All Regions

Editor:

　　Anshan City, Northeast China, is making efforts to introduce occupations to revolutionary disabled veterans and demobilized soldiers. More than 2,300 revolutionary disabled veterans and demobilized soldiers in the city have been given appropriate jobs. Many have entered factories to work, most of them serving as grass-roots cadres, and some have even become technicians. They perform very well in their work, and some have even made exemplary achievements. The experience of Anshan City proves that the statement that "revolutionary disabled veterans are already disabled and cannot work" is completely wrong.

　　The director of a factory told us: "Revolutionary disabled veterans and demobilized soldiers have a high political awareness and are conscientious and responsible in their work. Although their physical strength is poor, as long as the work is appropriately assigned, they can play a great role." Many facts can prove his words. For example, Zhang Shiqing, a revolutionary disabled veteran (Second Class A), used to be a worker. After entering the factory, he united the technical team leader with his own exemplary behavior, improved the production work of the entire team, and transformed the backward workers in his team. When a machine breaks down, he rushes to repair it without regard for his own safety. His exemplary behavior has been supported by all the workers. Comrade Cui Guanglin has created new records three times. These deeds all prove that revolutionary disabled veterans and demobilized soldiers have received political education in the army in the past and have undergone the severe test of the revolutionary war; therefore, they can show amazing strength in production work.

　　It is hoped that all regions can learn from the experience of Anshan City and earnestly do a good job in introducing occupations to revolutionary disabled veterans and demobilized soldiers, so that they can exert their strength in the country's construction work.

　　认真为荣誉军人介绍职业
　  使他们在生产中发挥力量
　  鞍山市的经验值得各地学习编辑同志：
    东北鞍山市努力为革命残废军人和复员军人介绍职业，全市二千三百多名革命残废军人和复员军人都已得到了适当的工作。有许多人进入工厂工作，他们大多充任基层干部，有的且已成为技术人员。他们在工作中的表现很好，有的还做出一些模范事迹。鞍山市的经验证明，那些认为“革命残废军人已经残废，就无法工作”的说法是完全错误的。
    某工厂厂长告我们说：“革命残废军人和复员军人政治觉悟都很高，对工作认真负责。虽然他们体力较差，但只要工作分配得适当，他们可以发挥很大的作用。”不少事实可以证明他的话。如革命残废军人（二等甲级）张世清，过去曾做过工人。进入工厂后，就以自己的模范行为，团结了技术组长，健全了全组的生产工作，并改造了本组落后的工友。机器发生故障时，他就奋不顾身地进行抢修。他的模范行为，已经得到了全体工友的拥护。崔广林同志三次创造了新纪录。这些事迹都证明了：革命残废军人和复员军人，过去在军队中受过政治教育，并经过革命战争的严重考验；因此在生产工作中，是能显出惊人力量的。
    希望各地都能学习鞍山市的经验，认真作好为革命残废军人和复员军人介绍职业的工作，使他们在国家建设工作中发挥自己的力量。
