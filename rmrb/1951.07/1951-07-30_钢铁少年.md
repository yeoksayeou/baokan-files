　　On the eve of the "August 1st" Army Day, the soldiers of the Hainan Military Region recalled the glorious history of their heroic struggles against the enemy. The following is the heroic story of a "Youth Company" from the Hainan People's Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Force, the predecessor of the Hainan Military Region troops.

　　In the spring of 1942, patriotic youths from all over Hainan Island enthusiastically responded to the call of the Chinese Communist Party and flocked to the front lines. Among the thousands of young people who joined the army, dozens were teenagers aged fifteen or sixteen. The troops, because they were too young, advised them to return home. They cried all day, unwilling to go back. Some protested to the leaders of the troops, saying, "Is it failing to resist Japan, but succeeding in going back to work as farmhands for landlords and being slaves of a subjugated country?" In the end, the troops had no choice but to keep them and temporarily form them into a special service company. This was the famous Youth Guerrilla, later active in the plains of northern Hainan Island.

　　After the special service company was established, everyone called it the "Youth Company." The entire company had ninety-five people and seventy-six rifles of varying lengths. Apart from the company commander, platoon leaders, individual squad leaders, and a twenty-year-old soldier known to the whole company as "Old Man," all were teenagers aged thirteen to sixteen. Of the twenty Communist Party members in the company, twelve were sixteen-year-old Party members. When their military training course had just finished learning "platoon attacks," the entire company was ordered to move to the guerrilla area due to the Japanese invaders' offensive.

　　In the winter of 1942, when the struggle against "nibbling" was at its fiercest, the "Youth Company" began to be active on the plains of northern Hainan Island. Initially, the "Youth Company" served as the guard for the headquarters of a certain main force unit, persisting in the anti-"nibbling" struggle in the Yunlong Township area of Qiongshan County, together with the broad masses of the people. At that time, other troops had all moved away. The higher-ups ordered the "Youth Company" to fight "sparrow warfare" with the enemy, to hold them back and help the headquarters scout out the enemy's situation. The "Youth Company" completed this task with their own brave, tenacious, and resourceful combat actions. All the combatants in the company formed nine guerrilla groups, which went out separately to attack. On the first day of combat, they killed eight enemy soldiers. From then on, the "Youth Company's" guerrilla groups appeared every day in front of, behind, and to the sides of the enemy, with each group engaging the enemy once to four times a day, keeping the enemy running around in circles. The enemy was both anxious and flustered, constantly harassed by a brave and tough "child soldiers" and unable to get away. Later, the enemy learned that this "child soldiers" was the guard force for our army's headquarters and began to change their combat methods and increase their attacking forces, shouting that they would eliminate this "child soldiers" within a month. At this time, our army headquarters was forced to move, leaving only the "Youth Company" to persist in the struggle.

　　Throughout the entire winter, the "Youth Company" persisted in the anti-"nibbling" struggle in Yunlong Township, fighting the brutal Japanese invaders in a harsh environment of cold, hunger, and disease. In more than two months, the "Youth Company" fought the enemy over two hundred times, killing and wounding dozens of enemy soldiers. In every battle, the "Youth Company" was extremely brave and tenacious.

　　On one occasion, the "Youth Company" was attacked by more than three hundred enemies in Beigongshan Village, Yunlong Township, and fought for an entire day, with seven young soldiers being killed in action. After the sacrifice of Squad Leader of the Seventh Squad and Party Branch Committee member, Comrade Fu Jian, Lin Tianshuang, a fifteen-year-old soldier in the squad, used a hand grenade to fight desperately with two Japanese soldiers, avenging his squad leader. After the battle, the political instructor led all the Party members and soldiers of the company in a solemn revenge oath at the tomb of Comrade Fu Jian and the fallen soldiers, after which morale rose even higher.

　　On one occasion, the "Youth Company" headquarters, with more than twenty people, was surrounded by more than two hundred enemies in an isolated mountain forest in the township. These twenty-odd young soldiers fought fiercely with the enemy for five days and nights. Three sixteen-year-old Communist Party members, Chen Deming, Fu Ruhan, and Fu Renchun, bravely rushed out to find reinforcements one after another, allowing the company headquarters to break through the encirclement at night with the coordination of the reinforcements. Although the "Youth Company" suffered no casualties in this battle, everyone went hungry for a full five days. Several sick soldiers and Wu Shuhe, a thirteen-year-old orderly, fainted from hunger but insisted on marching continuously. The next day, as soon as the soldiers finished drinking thin rice porridge, they went out to attack in separate groups again. After that, the "Youth Company" fought every day, and there were frequent casualties. However, under the education and encouragement of the Communist Party, they fought even more tenaciously.

　　On one occasion, the second platoon of the "Youth Company" was ambushed by more than forty enemies while moving. Under the leadership of Ying Denglu, a sixteen-year-old Communist Party member and platoon political fighter, three soldiers charged left and right at the enemy, breaking through the encirclement of more than forty enemy soldiers and covering the retreat of the entire platoon.

　　After this, the "Youth Company" changed its guerrilla groups into mass work groups, leading the masses to stand guard, defend themselves, and eliminate traitors. The masses regarded the soldiers of the "Youth Company" as their own children, supplying them with food and helping them with their work. The heroic "Youth Company" joined forces with the masses to persist in the struggle, overcome the difficult period, and successfully transferred to the western base area of Qiongshan County.

　　Afterward, the "Youth Company" remained active on the anti-Japanese front line of the South China Sea islands.

    “八一”建军节前夕，海南军区部队的战士们纷纷回忆他们在与敌人作顽强的斗争中所创造的光荣战史。下面，是海南军区部队的前身——海南人民抗日游击队中一个“少年连”的英勇事迹。
    一九四二年春，海南岛各地爱国青年热烈地响应中国共产党的号召，纷纷涌上前线。在成千个参军青年中，有好几十个是十五、六岁的少年。部队因为他们年纪太小，劝他们回去。他们整天哭着不愿回去。有的向部队首长提出抗议说：“抗日不及格，回去给地主放牛、做亡国奴就及格么？”最后，部队只好把他们留下，暂时编为一个特务连。这就是后来活跃在海南岛北部平原上一支有名的少年游击队。
    特务连成立后，大家都叫它为“少年连”。全连九十五人，七十六条长短枪。除了连长、排长、个别的班长和被全连人称为“老头子”的一个二十岁的战士外，都是十三岁至十六岁的少年。全连二十个共产党员中，十二个是十六岁的少年党员。当他们的军事训练课程刚刚学完“排攻击”的时候，因为日寇的进攻，全连奉命调到游击区去。
    一九四二年冬，反“蚕食”斗争正激烈的时候，“少年连”开始活跃在岛北部的平原上。起初，“少年连”担任某主力部队指挥部的警卫工作，在琼山县的云龙乡一带，与广大人民一起坚持反“蚕食”斗争。当时，其他部队都转移了。上级命令“少年连”和敌人打“麻雀战”，拖住敌人，帮助指挥部侦察敌情。“少年连”用自己的英勇、顽强和机智的战斗行动，完成了这个任务。全连战斗员组成了九个游击小组，分头出击。第一天作战就杀死了八名敌兵。从此，“少年连”的游击小组就天天出现在敌人的前后左右，每组每天都要和敌人接火一次至四次，把敌人打得团团转。敌人又急又慌，天天被一支勇猛强悍的“小孩兵”纠缠着不能脱身。后来，敌人知道这支“小孩兵”是我军指挥部的警卫部队，开始转变作战方式和增加进攻兵力，叫着要在一个月之内消灭这支“小孩兵”。这时，我军指挥部被迫转移，只留下“少年连”坚持斗争。
    在整个冬季里，“少年连”坚持着云龙乡的反“蚕食”斗争，在寒冷、饥饿、疾病的艰苦环境中，与蛮悍的日寇战斗着。在两个多月内，“少年连”和敌人作战二百余次，杀伤敌人几十名。在每次战斗中，“少年连”都非常英勇而顽强。
    有一次，“少年连”在云龙乡北公山村遭遇到三百多名敌人的袭击，作战竟日，七位少年战士阵亡。七班长、党支部委员符坚同志牺牲后，该班十五岁的战士林天双用手榴弹同两个日寇拚死，为班长报仇。战斗结束后，政治指导员率领该连全体党员和全连战士，在支部委员符坚同志和阵亡战士墓前，举行了庄严的复仇宣誓，之后，士气更加高涨起来。
    有一次，“少年连”连部二十余人，被二百余敌人包围于该乡的一个孤立的山林中，这二十余少年战士与敌人激战了五昼夜。三个十六岁的共产党员陈德明、符儒汉、符仁春，先后英勇地冲出去找援兵，使连部在来援部队的配合下，乘夜突围。这次战斗中“少年连”虽然没有伤亡，但每人整整饿了五天。几个病号和十三岁的勤务员吴淑和饿昏了，还坚持着连续行军。第二天，战士们刚喝完稀米汤，又分头出击了。此后，“少年连”天天打仗，也经常有伤亡。但是，他们在共产党的教养和鼓舞下，战斗得更顽强。
    有一次，“少年连”第二排在移动时遭受四十余名敌人的伏击，三个战士在十六岁的共产党员、排政治战士英登卢的带头下，向敌人左右冲杀，冲破了四十余名敌兵的包围，掩护全排撤退。
    在这以后，“少年连”把游击小组改为群众工作组，领导群众放哨、自卫和肃清汉奸。群众把“少年连”的战士当做自己的孩子，供给他们粮食，帮助他们工作。英雄的“少年连”，与群众一道坚持斗争，渡过了困难时期，顺利地转移到琼山县西部根据地。
    以后，“少年连”就一直活跃在南海岛的抗日前线。
