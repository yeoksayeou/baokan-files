  I. Design and Construction
    The People's Daily consecutively published the news and editorial "Construction is Impossible Without Correct Engineering Design." This editorial received widespread support in the engineering community, and many people regarded this sentence as their motto.
    For every engineering project, from the designer to the constructor, at the time, everyone believes it to be absolutely correct. Only when "accidents" occur during construction, do they discover that the "design was incorrect." The People's Daily pointed out this phenomenon. The reason? Chairman Mao pointed out the reason in "On Practice."
    Chairman Mao said: "Only those who look at problems subjectively, one-sidedly, and superficially, who rush to a place, without investigating the circumstances, without looking at the whole picture (the history and the present state of affairs), and without touching on the essence of things (the nature of things and the internal connections of this thing with other things), and then self-righteously issue orders, will inevitably stumble."
    Judging from the reports in the People's Daily, the main reasons for many engineering accidents are twofold: one is insufficient mastery of the materials below ground, such as insufficient bearing capacity of the foundation, etc. The other is the failure to calculate the stress of materials, or incorrect calculations, resulting in insufficient strength of the frame to support the top load, leading to collapse, etc. These two reasons are the result of subjectively drawing conclusions without clarifying the external environment and internal connections of things.
    Before engineering design, there should be geological and other investigations and explorations. The materials used should also be investigated and tested first. If it is construction of railways, highways, etc., the social and geographical conditions of the surrounding area should also be investigated. Only after comprehensively understanding the surrounding environment and internal connections can a perfect design be made. There are many examples of failures caused by the inconsistency between geology and subjective wishes. As for the investigation of materials used, it can also greatly affect construction costs. For example, a certain project in Tangshan was contracted separately by Companies A and B. The expected quality was the same, but Company A's analysis unit price was higher, but the total price was lower than that of Company B. This is because timber is expensive in Tangshan, one took care to use less wood in the overall layout, while the other did not pay attention. Based on this condition, in the preliminary estimate, the two companies differed by 27,000 yuan per square meter, and the total difference was several hundred million yuan. Chairman Mao told us: "The process of cognition has two stages. The first stage is the stage of perception, which begins with contact with the external world. The second stage is the stage of conception, judgment, and reasoning, which consists of synthesizing the data of perception and reorganizing them. Only when the data of perception are very rich (not fragmentary and incomplete) and conform to reality (not illusions), can correct concepts and theories be created based on such data." Investigation and research is the first step. If the first step is not taken, or if it is taken incorrectly, and then a decision is made (equivalent to design), then when the planned plan is put into practice (equivalent to construction), it will inevitably stumble.
    In addition to design engineers, the importance of construction engineers should not be underestimated for the success or failure of a project. Chairman Mao pointed out: "However, generally speaking, whether in the practice of transforming nature or transforming society, very few of the ideas, theories, plans, and programs originally determined by people are realized without any changes. This is because those who are engaged in transforming reality are often subject to many restrictions, not only often subject to scientific and technological conditions, but also subject to the development and degree of expression of the objective process (the aspects and essence of the objective process have not been fully exposed). Under such circumstances, it is common for ideas, theories, plans, and programs to be partially changed due to the discovery of unforeseen situations in practice, and it is also possible for them to be completely changed." Chairman Mao's instruction, like a chief engineer, expertly pointed out a solemn responsibility of a construction engineer, that is, he has the obligation to propose suggestions for improving the plan to the original design engineer based on the development of objective circumstances during the construction process, and even refuse the construction of unreasonable plans. This can avoid some errors in design work. At least it can keep major design errors in the design stage without blind construction. When a construction engineer accepts the construction task of a certain plan without objection, it means that he agrees with and supports the original plan. Since the general contract stipulates the clause of "changing the plan," in fact, the more complex the project, the easier it is to change the plan (changing the plan means that the original plan is wrong). Therefore, the importance of construction engineers and design engineers is equal in the success or failure of a project. I think that the design engineer is responsible for whether a project is economical and suitable, while the construction engineer is responsible for whether it is strong and durable.
    The responsibility of a construction engineer should not be just to blindly follow the original plan, but to propose suggestions for improving the original plan when encountering new situations. When an engineer in Tianjin was repairing a dry bridge in the suburbs of Tianjin, he changed the original continuous beam to a simple beam based on new conditions during construction (some bridge piers may subside). Another example is that sand foundation was found in a certain project in Tangshan during construction. Therefore, the proportion of sand and mud was first analyzed, the size of the sand was known, direct experience was obtained, and then books were consulted and people with experience in this field were asked by phone to obtain indirect experience, before improving the footing. Some comrades feel that this method is slower, but it is correct.
    Construction engineers should maintain close contact with the original design engineers when improving the design, and should at least fully understand the original designer's intentions.
    Design and construction are unified in terms of the goal of successfully completing the project. However, there are often differences of opinion in some specific work, and attention should be paid to solving them. For example, a design engineer at a certain place, for the convenience of calculation and one-sided economic value, disregarded the convenience of construction and prescribed a water-cement ratio that was too low, making it difficult for the constructor to make it. The two should respect each other and not despise each other. Some people in the construction department call people in the design department "draftsmen," thinking: "Without them, we can still work." Some people in the design department call people in the construction department "bricklayers," thinking: "A one-sided view, knowing this, forgetting that." It should be said that these views are all wrong, and are manifestations of dogmatism and empiricism. "On Practice" tells us: "Philosophical 'rationalism' and 'empiricism' do not understand the historicity or dialectics of cognition, although each has a one-sided truth (for materialistic rationalism and empiricism, not referring to idealistic rationalism and empiricism), but they are all wrong in the entirety of epistemology." Therefore, to solve these problems, it depends on everyone's political improvement.
    Another problem between design and construction is the organizational separation. At present, the organizational form of many projects generally divides an engineering department into design, construction, and materials, which can of course improve work efficiency. However, due to insufficient contact between each other, there are often situations where after the design is completed, there is nowhere to buy materials and no workers to find. (For example, an engineer designed an asphalt project in Tangshan, but there were no skilled workers in Tangshan for this project). It can also be said that the separation of design and construction has deepened the phenomenon of the separation of theory and practice, affecting the improvement of the technical level of the technical personnel themselves. "On Practice" clearly points out: "No matter who wants to know something, there is no way to solve it without contacting that thing, that is, living in (practicing in) the environment of that thing." Of course, if design and construction are closely linked, they can communicate with each other and exchange experiences. We have tried a project in which one person is responsible for everything from design to construction, but because of the lack of manpower, some comrades feel that "the division of labor is not clear," but from the perspective of combining theory and practice, it still has its value to be adopted.

  II. Improving One Step Can Avoid Waste
    Currently, some engineers have serious waste of materials, and this phenomenon is quite common to some extent. This phenomenon can only be fundamentally avoided after the class consciousness of these many engineering personnel is improved.
    Some engineers waste materials and labor when the state emphasizes safety, without seeking economic efficiency, almost "using kiln pillars to build houses." He himself can avoid the occurrence of liability accidents, but the country's property has suffered great losses. Since the cost of capital construction currently accounts for a large part of the country's investment, if there is an average of 20% of the above-mentioned waste, the total number will be very large. Therefore, this phenomenon is worthy of our organization to oppose with greater strength.
    One of the reasons for this waste is that some engineering technicians lack the view of serving the people wholeheartedly. After accepting tasks, they are often lazy to study carefully, and decide the size of materials roughly, thinking that they have "sufficient experience," and often claim "although this use is larger, it is more insured." Most of these people have some old-fashioned sophistication and engineering experience, and do not seek progress politically or technically. They only pay attention to dealing with work, and they know that a large amount of national wealth is wasted, but the waste is often not easy for laymen to see, and they are also satisfied with their "self-preservation" attitude. Such people are mediocre in both politics and technology, and need to improve their political awareness.
    Secondly, because there are too few technicians with theoretical training in our country. If they do not understand theory, they cannot understand the interrelationship of internal stresses of many materials, resulting in inevitable waste in the use of materials. This waste is very widespread, and often exceeds the proportion of correct material use by a large margin, such as the amount of steel bars used in some places may be 100% more. For such people, we must try to improve their theory and provide standard drawings.
    Thirdly, because the performance and specifications of domestic materials are not unified, they are often used at the lowest strength when used. For example, there are many kinds of domestic steel bars on the market, and some people do not know how much force each one can bear. In addition, the construction often does not follow the prescribed methods, and the maintenance of materials is not paid attention to, which also makes designers estimate the strength of materials in a low direction.
    The three reasons mentioned above are all caused by too low levels of politics or technology. This is a huge and painful loss figure. All patriotic engineering technicians should strive to improve themselves one step further. Resolutely oppose waste.

　　工程设计施工及其他（上）

  一、设计与施工
    人民日报一连串地刊载了《没有正确的工程设计就不可能施工》的消息与社论，这篇社论获得了工程界广泛的拥护，很多人把这句话当作座右铭。
    每一个工程计划，从设计人到施工人，在当时，都是认为绝对正确的。等到在施工的中途发生“意外”，然后才发现“设计不正确”了。人民日报指出了这种现象。原因呢？原因，毛主席在实践论中指出来了。
    毛主席说：“只有那些主观地、片面地与表面地看问题的人，跑到一个地方，不问环境的情况，不看事情的全体（事情的历史与全部现状），也不触到事情的本质（事情的性质及此一事情与其他事情的内部联系），就自以为是地发号施令起来，这样的人是没有不跌交子的。”
    从人民日报的报道看来，许多工程发生事故的主要原因，有两个：一个是对地面以下的材料掌握不够，如地基承重力不足等。另一个是没有计算材料应力，或计算错误，因而造成房架力量不足以支持顶重，以致倒坍等。这两个原因，就是没弄清事物的外部环境和内部联系而主观地下断语的结果。
    工程设计之先要有地质等方面的调查钻探，使用的材料也要先调查试验，如果是建筑铁路公路等，还要调查附近的社会和地理情况，全面地了解四周环境与内部联系后，才能作成一个完善的设计。因为地质与主观愿望不符，因而造成失败的例子很多。至于使用材料的调查，也能大大地影响建筑费用。例如，唐山某工程，由甲乙两营造厂分别承包，预计质量一样，甲公司的分析单价较高，而总价反比乙公司便宜。就是由于唐山木料贵，一个在总布置上照顾到少用木料，而另一个未注意到的原故。根据这个条件，在初步概算上，两公司每平方米相差达二万七千元，总起来则相差几亿元。毛主席告诉我们：“认识的过程，第一步，是开始接触外界事情，属于感觉的阶段。第二步，是综合感觉的材料加以整顿和改造，属于概念、判断与推理的阶段。只有感觉的材料十分丰富（不是零碎不全）与合于实际（不是错觉），才能根据这样的材料造出正确的概念与论理来。”调查研究是第一步，如果不走第一步，或走错了，就作出决定（相当于设计）来，那么在将预定计划付诸实践（相当于施工）时，必定要跌交子。
    在设计工程师之外，施工工程师的重要性，对一个工程的成败上，是不可低估的。毛主席指出：“然而一般地说来，不论在变革自然或变革社会的实践中，人们原定的思想、理论、计划、方案，毫无改变地实现出来的事，是很少的。这是因为从事变革现实的人们，常常受着许多的限制，不但常常受着科学条件与技术条件的限制，而且也受着客观过程的发展及其表现程度的限制（客观过程的方面及本质尚未充分暴露）。在这种情形之下，由于实践中发现前所未料的情况，因而部分地改变思想、理论、计划、方案的事是常有的，全部地改变的事也是有的。”毛主席这个指示，就像一个总工程师那样内行地指出了一个施工工程师的一个庄严的责任，即他有义务在施工过程中，根据客观情况的发展，向原设计工程师提出改进计划的建议，甚至拒绝不合理计划的施工。这样就可以避免某些设计工作上的错误。至少可使大的设计过失停留在设计阶段，而不至于盲目施工。一个施工工程师在接受某一计划的施工任务而无异议时，就表示了他对原计划的同意与支持。由于一般合同上都规定了“变更计划”这一条，事实上工程愈复杂，愈易变更计划（变更计划即表示原计划错误），因而在一个工程的成败上，施工工程师与设计工程师的重要性是相等的。我以为一个工程的能否经济、合用，设计工程师负责要多一些；而坚固、耐久方面施工工程师负责要多一些。
    施工工程师的责任，不应该只是盲目地依照原计划工作，而应是在遇到新的情况时，提出改进原计划的建议。天津某工程师在修津郊旱桥时，根据施工中的新情况（有的桥墩可能沉陷）而将原连续梁改为简支梁。又如唐山某工程中途发现沙子地基，于是先分析了沙泥的比例，知道了沙子的大小，取得了直接经验，再翻书、打电话问这方面有经验的人，取得间接经验，才改善地脚。这样作法，有的同志觉得慢一些，但这样是对的。
    施工工程师在改进设计中，应该与原设计工程师密切联系，至少要全部明了原设计人的意图。
    设计与施工在为胜利完成工程的目的上来讲是统一的。但在某些具体工作方面常常有分歧的意见，应当注意解决。如某处设计工程师为了计算的便利与片面的经济价值，而不顾及施工的便利，过低地规定了水灰比例，使施工人不易作成。两者应互相尊重，不能互相轻视。有些施工部门的人，叫设计部门的人为“画图的”，认为：“没有他们，我们一样作活。”有些设计部门的人叫施工部门的人为“瓦匠头”，认为：“一孔之见，会了这样，忘了那样。”应该说，这种看法都是错误的，是教条主义与经验主义的表现，实践论告诉我们：“哲学上的‘唯理论’与‘经验论’都不懂得认识的历史性或辩证性，虽然各有片面的真理（对于唯物的唯理论与经验论而言，非指唯心的唯理论与经验论），但在认识论的全体上则都是错误的。”所以要解决这些问题，有赖于大家在政治上提高一步。
    设计与施工之间的另外一个问题，是组织上的分家。目前，许多工程的组织形式，一般把一个工程部门分成设计、施工、材料三部分，这当然是可以提高工作效率的。但由于彼此之间的联系不够，常有设计完成后，材料无处买，工人无处找的情形。（如某工程师在唐山设计柏油工程而唐山无是项技术工人）。也可以说，设计与施工的分家，加深了理论与实践脱节的现象，影响了技术人员本身业务水平的提高。实践论清楚地指出：“无论何人要认识什么事物，除了同那个事物接触，即生活于（实践于）那个事物的环境中，是没有法子解决的。”当然，如果设计与施工连系密切，则彼此可以沟通意见，交换经验的。我们曾试行一件工程，由一个人从设计到施工负责到底的办法，但由于人手少，因而使某些同志觉得“分工不明”，但从理论与实践结合这个角度来讲，仍有其值得采用的价值。
  二、提高一步才能避免浪费
    目前有些工程师在使用材料上存在着严重浪费的现象，而且这种现象在某种程度上讲相当普遍。这种现象，只有在这许多工程人员的阶级觉悟提高后，才可根本避免。
    有些工程师在国家强调安全的时候，便浪费材料人工，不求经济效率，几乎“用窑柱来盖房子”。他个人可以避免责任事故的发生，但国家的财产受到了很大的损失。由于基本建设的费用在目前占国家投资的一大部分，如果平均有百分之二十的上述的浪费，则其总数将是很大的。所以这种现象是值得我们组织更大的力量来反对的。
    造成这种浪费的原因有一种是由于有些工程技术人员缺乏全心全意为人民服务的观点。他们在接受任务后，往往懒于仔细钻研，自以为“经验充足”，粗枝大叶地决定用料尺寸，而且居然经常宣称“这样用，虽然大一些，但更保险一些。”这样的人，多半有一些旧社会的世故与工程经验，在政治上技术上不求进步。工作上只注意应付，自己明知这样浪费了大量的国家财富，但其浪费现象，外行往往不易看出，也满足于自己的“明哲”态度。这种人，无论在政治上技术上都是庸人，需要提高其政治觉悟。
    其次，由于我国有理论修养的技术人员还太少。如果不懂理论，便弄不清许多材料的内部应力的相互关系，因而在使用材料上造成必然的浪费。这样浪费的面很宽，往往超出正确用料的比例也很大，如有的地方使用钢筋量会多出百分之百。对于这样的人，我们要设法提高其理论，并供给标准图样。
    第三，由于国产材料的性能及规格未统一，在使用时往往按最低的强度使用。例如目前市面的国产钢筋种类很多，究竟那一种能吃力多大，有些人不知道。又在施工上往往不按规定的作法，材料的保养也不讲究，也使得设计者向低的方面去估计材料强度。
    以上所讲三种原因都是由于在政治上或技术上的水平过低而造成的。这是巨大的、可痛的损失数字。一切爱国的工程技术人员，应努力把自己提高一步。坚决反对浪费现象。
