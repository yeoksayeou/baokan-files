State-owned Huaibei Saltworks Blindly Constructs, Trusts Contractors
　Sluice Gates, Pumps, and Other Projects All Malfunction, Reducing Production and Wasting Huge Amounts of Funds

　　During capital construction in 1949 and 1950, leading cadres at the state-owned Huaibei Saltworks did not plan thoroughly, blindly invested in construction, and failed to pay attention to the political education of cadres and technical personnel, allowing cadres to become corrupt and degenerate, resulting in serious losses to state property.

　　In the past two years, Huaibei Saltworks has invested over 10 million catties of wheat in construction and earthwork projects. The larger construction projects included the four sluice gates in Guandong Saltworks (for tide control and intake) and the Xishu Pumping Station (supplying water to the Taipei, Tainan, and Fangyang Saltworks); the larger earthwork projects included the Guandong and Guanxi tide barriers (seawalls) and the Yanweigang Tuo ground (high ground for salt storage). Almost all of these major projects have encountered problems. Before the projects began, leading cadres did not conduct sufficient preparatory work, lacked necessary investigation and research, and did not distinguish between the priority of the projects. In construction, they emphasized projects for tide control and intake and the installation of machinery, but neglected projects for preventing and draining freshwater, which reduced the effectiveness of tide control and intake and even affected production. Before constructing the Jianzhong Sluice Gate, they did not conduct thorough research when selecting the location, and did not consider the problem of preventing and draining freshwater, placing the sluice gate at the Guanhe River mouth where the Yi River flows into the sea. The Jianzhong Sluice Gate was originally intended to intake saltwater tides for production, but the freshwater from the Guanhe River flowed into the polder area, diluting the brine, which in turn reduced production. The Guandong Saltworks' tide barrier (seawall) was originally designed to protect the salt flats and block seawater tides, but no freshwater prevention measures were taken. As a result, during the spring and autumn salt harvests, rainwater and freshwater filled the salt flats, diluting the brine. At the same time, saltwater tides could not be taken in, and freshwater could not be drained, which prolonged evaporation time and reduced production. In 1950, the saltworks only completed 64.5 percent of its original target (there were other reasons for the decline in production). In fact, preventing and draining freshwater was entirely feasible at the time, but the leadership did not pay attention to it.

　　Most of the saltworks' projects were not preceded by investigation and research and were entirely contracted out to a private merchant, resulting in a loss of approximately 700,000 catties of wheat due to the excessive pricing of the contractor alone. At the same time, there was no strict supervision and inspection after construction, leading to problems with the projects. After contracting for the Xintan, Pugang, and Honggang three sluice gates, the private merchant was sloppy in construction and cut corners. The three sluice gates are in a dangerous state of sinking and cracking due to insufficient foundation strength. Simply overpricing these three gates when they were contracted to the private merchant resulted in a loss of 224,000 catties. Due to the leadership's erroneous belief that uniting technical personnel meant unprincipled accommodation, and also due to a lack of political education for cadres, when constructing the Xishu Pumping Station project, the director and deputy director of the engineering department accepted gifts from private merchants and decided without principle not to put the project out for bid, contracting it to the same private merchant exclusively, which was one of the main reasons for the losses.

　　When constructing the Xishu Pumping Station project, there was no careful calculation. In order to achieve "lasting benefit," they falsely reported the shortcomings of the old waterway and the advantages of the new waterway to the East China Salt Affairs Bureau in order to obtain approval to rebuild the new waterway. In fact, although the old waterway had a longer intake channel and needed to be dredged once a year, the labor cost was not large, and it was much more cost-effective than rebuilding the new waterway. As a result of building the new waterway, it is estimated that the investment was approximately 900,000 catties of wheat more than repairing the old waterway.

　　When constructing the Yanweigang Tuo ground project, in order to store more salt, the bearing capacity of the foundation was not accurately estimated, and two storage areas were combined into one, placing the center of gravity of the salt pile in the middle. In addition, there were errors in the construction, and the salt river on the Tuo ground was dug two feet deeper, reducing the foundation bearing capacity; at the same time, the Tuo ground was not tamped firmly, resulting in subsidence (in a concave-outward convex shape), brine infiltration, and the dissolution of over 800 dan of salt; plus the cost of transferring the salt, 30,000 catties of wheat, the total loss amounted to 100,000 catties of wheat.

### 国营淮北盐场盲目修建轻信包商  水闸抽水机等工程都出了毛病  降低了生产量并且浪费了巨额资金

　　国营淮北盐场盲目修建轻信包商
　  水闸抽水机等工程都出了毛病  　降低了生产量并且浪费了巨额资金
    国营淮北盐场在一九四九年和一九五○年进行基本建设时，领导干部计划不周密，盲目投资修建，同时对干部和技术人员未注意进行政治教育，放任干部腐化堕落，使国家财产遭受严重损失。
    淮北盐场近两年来在建筑及土方工程上，共投资小麦一千余万斤。较大的建筑工程为灌东场的四个水闸（防潮纳潮用）和西墅抽水机（供台北、台南、方洋三盐场用水）；土方工程较大的为灌东、灌西挡潮大堆（海堤），燕尾港坨地（放盐的高地）等。这些较大的工程差不多都发生了问题。在工程进行之先，领导干部没有进行充分的准备工作，缺乏必要的调查研究，没有分清工程的轻重缓急。在修建中，重视防潮纳潮和装置机器的工程，但却忽略了防淡水排淡水的工程，以致降低了防潮纳潮的作用，甚至影响生产。在建筑建中水闸之先，选择地点时没有很好研究，没有估计到防淡水排淡水的问题，把水闸设在沂水入海的灌河口。建中水闸原为纳咸潮供生产之用，但是灌河淡水经过这里流入圩滩，冲淡了卤水，反而使生产量减低。灌东场的防潮大堆（海堤）原为保护盐滩，阻挡海潮而设，但是未作防止淡水冲入盐场的防淡工程。结果春季、秋季扫盐时，雨水及淡水充满盐场，冲淡了卤水。同时咸潮纳不到，淡水排不出去，延长了蒸发时间，降低了产量，一九五○年该场仅完成原定任务的百分之六十四点五（产量降低也还有其他原因）。实际上防淡排淡工程在当时是完全可以做到的而领导未予重视。
    该场大部工程事先都没有进行调查研究，完全包给一个私商，单是工方估价过高即损失小麦七十万斤左右。同时，施工后又没进行严格的监督检查，以致工程发生问题。私商包下新滩、蒲港、洪港三闸工程后，施工马虎，偷工减料。三闸因闸基不够坚固，呈现陷裂险状。这三闸包给私商时，只是工方单价高订就损失二十二万四千斤。由于领导上错误地把团结技术人员当做无原则的迁就，同时对干部缺少政治教育，建筑西墅抽水机工程的时候，工程室正副主任接受私商礼物，无原则地决定不投标，把工程仍包给同一私商独作，是造成损失的主要原因之一。
    在修建西墅抽水机工程时，没有精打细算。为了做到“一劳永逸”，向华东区盐务管理局虚报旧水道的缺点和新水道的优点，以便批准重建新水道。实际上旧水道虽然进水道较长，一年须要挖掏一次，但费工并不大，比较重修新水道要合算得多。建筑新水道的结果，据估计比修旧水道要多投资约合九十万斤小麦。
    建筑燕尾港坨地工程时，为了要多放盐，没有精确估计地基力量，就把两廪合一廪，堆盐重心压在中间。加上施工中有错误，把坨地盐河多挖深了二尺，减低了地基擎力；同时坨地打得也不坚固，以致下陷（呈中凹外凸状），卤水内浸，消化盐八百余担；加上转坨费三万斤小麦，共又损失合计小麦十万斤。
