Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, July 25th: The World Peace Council Executive Bureau at its Helsinki meeting unanimously adopted the following resolution calling for strengthening the struggle to defend peace:

    "The Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council, currently meeting in Helsinki, addresses these words to all organizations and groups, to all people worldwide who recognize that peace is in danger and must be defended.

    Examining the world situation, it is clear that the struggle to defend peace must be strengthened.

    On the one hand, the year-long fierce fighting in the Korean battlefield has proven that attempting to resolve international conflicts by force is a futile delusion. Proposals to cease hostilities in Korea have been welcomed with hope by the people of all countries. This proves that the most effective way to resolve differences and eliminate disagreements is through negotiation, not war. However, the facts show that the vigilance of the people of all countries is extremely important; only in this way can the spirit of cooperation prevail and a ceasefire be achieved.

    On the other hand, the international situation has become more complex in recent months. The arms expansion movement continues to accelerate. The meeting of the Deputy Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers, after lengthy discussions, has unfortunately failed to meet the expectations of the people. Currently, there are attempts to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan, excluding relevant countries and preventing them from participating in the peaceful resolution of the Japanese issue. The rearmament of Germany and Japan has reached the stage of establishing armies, the existence of which causes concern among the neighbors of these two countries and further endangers world peace. The number of naval and air force bases is constantly increasing, and the production of weapons of mass destruction is also escalating. In addition, new conflicts have occurred in the Near East and threaten to become more acute and expand.

    This situation shows that if we do not want to fall into the abyss, there is still much to be done.

    In the current situation, what must we do? First, we must do everything possible to support efforts to establish a ceasefire agreement in Korea. Without such public support, the war may drag on and the hopes of the people will be dashed.

    A ceasefire in Korea is a very important issue, but the people of all countries must realize that this is only the first stage in the struggle for peace. With this stage, it will be possible to conduct broader negotiations in the future, not only in military terms but also in political terms. In order to create the necessary conditions for international cooperation, new negotiations must in any case lead to the conclusion of an agreement among the five major powers, that is, the conclusion of a Five-Power Pact of Peace, which welcomes the participation of all countries.

    Only the pressure of public opinion and the will to defend peace, only these can overcome obstacles and break down resistance. Because the United Nations is no longer able to fulfill its primary task—maintaining peace—negotiations among the five major powers have become the only way to resolve existing differences.

    The first consequence of the conclusion of a Five-Power Pact of Peace should be to enable the United Nations to resume its original mission and restore its normal activities, which will ensure the cooperation of all countries.

    The second consequence is to make possible universal, gradual, simultaneous, and supervised disarmament. The first stage of this disarmament must not be limited to stopping the arms expansion movement. It must also include the complete prohibition and strict control of atomic weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction. It must also include substantial reductions in the armies and armaments of the major powers. Finally, for the sake of effectiveness, this control must be implemented not only on weapons that have been announced and their production, but must also inspect and detect weapons that have not yet been announced and their production.

    The third consequence of the peace pact is to eliminate hostility and restore cooperation between countries, which will make it possible to raise living standards and utilize the economic resources of all countries while respecting their national independence.

    The first stage of this international cooperation must be to establish and develop normal economic relations and cultural ties between different countries. The arms expansion movement—the source of wealth for a very few and poverty for the majority—must be replaced by a policy of extending scientific and technological achievements and discoveries to all mankind.

    Therefore, with a Five-Power Pact of Peace, it will not only be possible to eliminate the immediate danger of the outbreak of war, but also to establish lasting peace.

    In order to ensure that the spirit of negotiation can prevail in the handling of international issues, and in order to ensure that human activities are once again aimed at peace, the World Peace Council first calls on the national peace committees of all countries to redouble their efforts, strengthen their activities, and use all means to disseminate the propositions in this resolution.

    The World Peace Council also calls on all groups and organizations that wish to maintain peace to participate in the ongoing activities calling for the five major powers to conclude a peace pact. The World Peace Council promises to provide assistance for all measures that these groups and organizations consider necessary for peace.

    All men and women, all people of all countries, are equally concerned about peace. If they are to avoid disaster, they must, regardless of their differences, unite their will to defend peace, so that the cause of peace will be saved."

### 世界和平理事会执行局会议  号召加强保卫和平斗争的决议

　　世界和平理事会执行局会议
　  号召加强保卫和平斗争的决议
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社赫尔辛基二十四日讯：世界和平理事会执行局赫尔辛基会议一致通过号召加强保卫和平斗争的决议如下：
    “世界和平理事会执行局正在赫尔辛基举行会议，现在特向一切组织和团体，向全世界一切认识到和平已处于危险之中并必须加以保卫的人们讲几句话。
    研究一下世界的局势，可以看到保卫和平的斗争还必须加强。
    一方面，朝鲜战场一年来的激战已经证明，想用武力来解决国际冲突，是徒然的妄想。停止朝鲜敌对行动的建议，受到了各国人民满怀希望的欢迎。这就证明了：解决分歧、消除异见的最有效的办法是谈判而不是战争。但事实表明，各国人民的警觉是非常重要的，只有这样，合作的精神才能取得胜利，停战才能实现。
    另一方面，最近几个月来国际形势变得更为复杂了。扩张军备运动不断加速。四国外长助理会议经过长久的讨论之后，终于违背人民的期望而宣告失败。目前，又有人企图缔订单独的对日和约，排斥那些有关的国家，不让它们参加日本问题的和平解决。德国和日本的重新武装已经到了建立军队的地步，这些军队的存在引起了这两国的邻国的忧虑，而且更进一步地危害着全世界的和平。海军和空军基地的数目在不断增加，大规模杀人武器的生产也在激增。此外新的冲突已在近东发生，并有变得更加尖锐和扩大之势。
    这种形势表明：假如我们不愿陷入深渊，还有非常多的事情要做。
    在目前的情势下我们必须做些什么呢？首先，我们必须尽一切力量支持在朝鲜成立停战协定的努力。如果没有这种舆论的支持，战争便可能拖延下去，人民的希望将会落空。
    朝鲜的停战是非常重要的问题，但是各国人民必须认识到这只是争取和平斗争的第一阶段。有了这个阶段，今后不仅在军事方面而且在政治方面，就有可能来进行更为广泛的谈判。为了造成国际合作的必要条件，新的谈判无论如何必须使五大国缔结协定，也就是缔结欢迎一切国家参加的五大国和平公约。
    只有舆论的压力和保卫和平的意志，只有这些才能克服障碍和破除抵抗。由于联合国已没有能力履行其主要任务——维护和平，因此目前五大国举行谈判就成为解决现存分歧的唯一办法。
    五大国缔结和平公约后，第一个后果应该是使联合国再担负起它原来的使命，恢复它原来的正常活动，这样将可能保证一切国家的合作。
    第二个后果是使普遍的、逐步的、同时进行的并且有监督的裁军可能实现。这种裁军的第一阶段决不要仅限于停止扩张军备运动。它还必须包含完全禁止和严格管制原子武器以及其他一切大规模杀人的武器。它还必须包含大量裁减各大国的军队与军备。最后为了有效起见，这种管制不仅要实施于已经公布的武器及其生产上，并且必须对尚未公布的武器及其生产进行检查和侦察。
    和平公约的第三个后果是消除敌视心理，恢复各国间的合作，这样就有可能来提高生活水平，利用一切国家的经济资源而又尊重各国的民族独立。
    这种国际合作的第一阶段必须是建立与发展不同国家间正常的经济关系与文化联系。扩张军备运动——这是极少数人发财和大多数人贫穷的源泉—必须代之以把科学和技术上的成就与发现推广到全人类的政策。
    因此，有了五大国和平公约，将不仅可能消灭战争爆发的直接危险，而且可能建立持久的和平。
    为了使谈判的精神能在国际问题的处理上得到胜利，为了使人类的活动再度以和平为其目标，世界和平理事会首先向各国的全国和平委员会呼吁，号召它们加倍努力，加强它们的活动，并利用一切方法传播本决议中的主张。
    世界和平理事会也向所有希望保持和平的团体和组织呼吁，要求它们参加已经在进行着的要求五大国缔结和平公约的活动，世界和平理事会答应对于这些团体和组织认为为了和平必须采取的各种措施，一概给予援助。
    所有的男人和女人，所有国家的人民都同样关心和平。如果他们要免于浩劫，他们就要不问他们中间有何分歧，而把他们保卫和平的意志统一起来，这样，和平的事业就会得救。”
