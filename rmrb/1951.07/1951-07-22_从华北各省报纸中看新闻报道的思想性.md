　　On the Ideological Character of News Reports from Newspapers in North China Provinces
　　Wang Dingkun
　　The newspapers of the North China provinces, which grew up during the War of Resistance Against Japan, have played a good guiding role in guiding millions of people to participate in movements such as the War of Resistance Against Japan, land reform, and the War of Liberation. The newspapers have praised many advanced figures among workers and peasants, and used vivid deeds and examples to educate the people to learn from them. The newspapers have earnestly explained the Party's various policies through the people's various struggles. In the past year, the newspapers have also paid attention to carrying out criticism and self-criticism, strengthening the work of connecting with the masses, and the newspapers are gradually becoming a good weapon for self-education for millions of people. However, these achievements should be said to be not what we can be satisfied with. Newspapers must constantly guide the people to revolutionize, help the people understand the relationship between Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and the Chinese revolution, and enable the people to not only thank Chairman Mao from their beautiful lives, but also be able to understand why it is correct to follow Mao Zedong. If we examine the ideological guidance work of newspapers entering the new era according to this standard, then it should be admitted that there are indeed many problems.
　　We can briefly recall the situation in the two years since the focus of work shifted from rural areas to cities:
　　The Party's work in the cities is to wholeheartedly rely on the working class and take the restoration and development of industrial production as the central task. How have newspapers implemented this central task? Newspapers have devoted some space to publishing workers' inventions and creations, production achievements, and introduced some typical examples of factories and mines relying on workers to improve production, which is necessary. However, newspapers rarely explain the fundamental nature of issues such as why we should rely on the working class, where the advanced role of the working class is manifested, and how to understand it correctly through vivid facts, and also rarely conduct criticism of incorrect understandings. Certain responsible personnel of factories and enterprises openly advocate the argument that technology is above all else, and openly disseminate the statement that as long as there is technology, factories can be run well even without trade unions, and the newspapers can turn a blind eye; some peasant cadres do not recognize the leading role of the working class, thinking that doing so is "forgetting the peasants after winning the country," and the newspapers rarely express their attitude towards this.
　　After the completion of land reform in various parts of North China, peasants generally worried about being "communized" and eating from a communal pot. Party organizations in various provinces of North China conducted education among the peasants for this reason, but many newspapers did not guide the peasants to correctly understand this issue, but only sporadically introduced some methods and effects of education. Therefore, when peasants turned to active production and there was a tendency to bury their heads in production and not care about politics, the ideological guidance of the newspapers was unclear, and some were even encouraging selfish ideas of getting rich. This selfish idea of getting rich has been reflected in the cadres, and some cadres demanded to return home to produce without revolution, and the newspapers only lightly published a few articles of reflection from the cadres.
　　Vigorously assisting farmers in selling local products is something that no government in Chinese history has ever done. But from the reports, we only focused on introducing the methods and situations of local product exchange, and some news even blindly advocated learning from private merchants without analysis.
　　People's Congresses at all levels are an important form for the people to exercise state power, but the reports focus on writing about the form of democracy.
　　Since the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, newspapers have made progress in patriotic education. The newspapers reported the truth of "saving neighbors and saving oneself" through different forms such as news, clapper talk, and stories. They reported the hatred of people from all walks of life for the U.S. imperialism's arming of Japan, and helped the people understand from their own experiences that U.S. imperialism and Japanese fascism are consistent. In the reports on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, they also guided the people to understand the relationship between Chiang Kai-shek, the U.S., and special agents from vivid examples. In the recent reports on the cotton sale and storage movement, they helped farmers understand the relationship between individuals and the country. However, the main reason for this improvement is that these movements themselves have a high degree of ideology, and the newspapers themselves have not consciously guided the people forward from a political and ideological point of view. The widespread neglect of the discussion of "The Life of Wu Xun" in North China newspapers, and the emphasis on only reprinting the People's Daily editorial and articles without providing popular explanations and without intending to guide mass discussion, which was only corrected after criticism, is a very obvious example.
　　What do all these situations illustrate? It shows that our news reports have long been accustomed to the method of dealing with matters as they stand, and are not good at using the ideological weapons given to us by Chairman Mao to analyze and understand the things to be reported, so what is captured is only the phenomenon of things. A lot of "living people and living things" are piled up, but very few can thoroughly explain the "living principles." The theory we study is divorced from the practice of reporting. Chairman Mao's teaching that "the serious problem is educating the peasants" can be recited fluently, but the phenomenon of only caring about getting rich and not caring about national interests among the peasants is ignored. Patriotism is a driving force that often plays a role in all work, but it was not until after the vigorous movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea was launched that this theme was better expressed in the newspapers. The separation of news reports from theoretical guidance, and the lack of ability to analyze and express the significance of all fresh things with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, is the fundamental reason for the lack of ideology in our news reports.
　　But this does not mean that the newspapers had no ideology in the past. In order to solve the erroneous tendency of peasants not caring about national interests, the Shanxi Daily took Li Shunda as a banner and carried out multiple propaganda campaigns, and published an editorial stating that Li Shunda is both a production model and a patriotic model. The newspaper launched a serious criticism of the principal of Taiyuan Normal School, who only emphasized difficulties and did not care about students, and insisted on his own opinions. In the reports on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the Hebei Daily published editorials based on the different ideological understanding of the masses in various periods, analyzed them, and pointed out how to correctly understand the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. The Suiyuan Daily learned about the ideological demands of the masses by strengthening contact with reading groups, so that news reports were further combined with reality, and the newspaper thus achieved significant improvements. These practices must be affirmed and carried forward. In order to be able to systematically and purposefully publicize Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in the future, newspapers in various places need to work hard in the following aspects.
　　First, newspaper workers must strengthen their understanding and analysis of the ideological situation of the masses in various central tasks. For example, when reporting on the current patriotic bumper harvest movement in rural areas, we should not just put the production achievements and enthusiasm of a certain county or village on the newspaper, but should deeply understand the understanding of the significance of the patriotic bumper harvest competition among peasants with different levels of awareness, praise peasants who can correctly understand the relationship between patriotism and bumper harvest, educate those peasants who only know about bumper harvest and do not know the relationship between individuals and the country, and criticize the idle thoughts of not caring about the country and not actively producing. The task of the newspaper is to improve the awareness of the peasants through the reports of the patriotic bumper harvest movement, so we cannot be satisfied with reporting some phenomena in the production competition. To achieve this, newspapers must strengthen their contact with readers, strengthen their investigation and research on the actual situation, and newspaper workers must strive to improve their theoretical level of Marxism-Leninism and strengthen their analytical ability. If editors and reporters cannot correctly distinguish between the proletarian ideology, peasant ideology, petty-bourgeoisie, bourgeois ideology, and even the ideology of hostile classes manifested in various movements, the newspaper cannot correctly publicize Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and the ideology of the newspaper cannot be improved.
　　Second, based on the understanding and research of the ideological situation in the central work, determine the key points and formulate a practical reporting plan. The reporting plan must implement the spirit of improving the ideological awareness of the masses, and require that through the advanced experience, the praise of advanced figures, and the criticism of backward ideas, the people's understanding of Mao Zedong Thought be improved one step further. For example, through the reports of good and bad typical examples in the people's congresses at all levels, we should help the people understand Chairman Mao's thought on "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," and through the reports on material exchange and cotton purchase and storage, we should help the people understand the thought of the worker-peasant alliance.
　　Third, after the propaganda policy of the newspaper is determined for a certain period, it should strengthen the propaganda in this area around the center and use various forms. In the beginning of the transition process, you may encounter difficulties in the lack of manuscripts, but as long as the discussion and reports of the newspaper really touch the thoughts of the masses, the difficulties of the manuscripts are easy to solve. In the organization of the reports on the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Jishan, the Shanxi Daily focused on analyzing the paralysis thought in it. Readers from all over the country quickly reflected this thought in the newspaper, and the newspaper then seized it to launch a discussion, which not only made the source of manuscripts not difficult, but also further educated the people.
　　Fourth, in addition to strengthening the ideological guidance of the reports on the central work, the newspaper should also set up a special column to carry out ideological criticism in a planned way, such as why the working class is the leading class, what is the difference between a new democratic country and a socialist country, and why society must inevitably move towards communism, etc., should be linked to the thoughts of the masses to carry out some criticisms and debates. In the past, newspapers have also made some explanations in this regard, but because they did not grasp the specific events and the thoughts reflected by specific people and then raised them to the theoretical principles for discussion, the debate was not easy to unfold. The Party Life column should also organize some ideological discussions on the nature of the Party and the Party's organizational principles, and should not only introduce some model Party members in a flat manner.
　　Various tasks in North China are gradually deepening, and the ideological situation reflected by people from all walks of life in the movement is very complicated. Our newspapers must take on the task of ideological guidance so that all the people can distinguish between the enemy and ourselves and consciously work hard to defend the motherland and build the motherland.

　　从华北各省报纸中看新闻报道的思想性
　　王定坤
    在抗日战争中生长起来的华北各省报纸，均曾在引导千百万群众参加抗日斗争、土地改革、解放战争等运动中起了很好的指导作用。报纸表扬过许许多多工农群众中的先进人物，用活的事迹和榜样教育人民向他们学习。报纸通过人民的各种斗争，认真解释了党的各种政策。近一年来报纸并注意了开展批评和自我批评，加强了连系群众的工作，报纸正逐渐地成为千百万人民良好的自我教育的武器。但是这些成就应该说还不是我们所能满意的。报纸要不断地引导人民革命化，要帮助人民理解马克思列宁主义毛泽东思想和中国革命的关系，要使人民不仅从美好的生活中感谢毛主席，而且能认识为什么跟着毛泽东走是正确的。如果依据这个标准来检查进入新时期的报纸思想指导工作，那么，应该承认问题确实是很多的。
    我们可以简单地回忆一下工作重点由乡村转入城市后两年来的情况：
    党在城市中的工作是要全心全意地依靠工人阶级，并将恢复和发展工业生产作为中心任务。报纸对于这个中心任务是怎样贯彻的呢？报纸以一部分篇幅登载了工人的创造发明、生产成绩；介绍过一些厂矿依靠工人搞好生产的典型范例，这是必要的。但是对于为什么要依靠工人阶级？工人阶级的先进作用表现在那里？究竟应该如何理解等根本性质的问题，报纸很少通过活的事实进行解释，也很少对于不正确的认识开展批评。某些工厂企业的负责人员在那里公开提倡技术高于一切的论调，公开传播离开工会只要有技术照样可以办好工厂的言论，报纸可以不闻不问；某些农民干部不承认工人阶级的领导作用，认为这样做是“得了天下忘了农民”，报纸对此亦很少表示态度。
    华北各地土地改革完成后，农民中曾普遍产生怕“共产”吃大锅饭的顾虑，华北各省党组织为此曾在农民中进行了教育，但许多报纸并没有引导农民正确认识这个问题，而只是零星地介绍了一些进行教育的方法和效果。因此当农民转向积极生产并发生了埋头生产不问政治的偏向后，报纸的思想指导是不明确的，甚至有的还在那里助长自私的发财思想。这种自私的发财思想已反映到干部中来了，有的干部要求不革命回家生产，报纸亦只是轻描淡写地发表几篇干部的反省文章。
    大力协助农民推销土产，中国有历史以来的政府均没有做过这件事。但从报道中看，我们却只偏重介绍了土产交流的方法与情况，有的新闻中甚至盲目地不加分析地提倡向私商学习。
    各界人民代表会是人民行使政权的重要形式，但报道中着重写出的只是民主的形式。
    抗美援朝运动以来，报纸在爱国主义教育方面是有进步的。报纸通过新闻、快板、故事等不同形式报道了“救邻自救”的道理。报道了各阶层人民对于美帝国主义武装日本的愤恨，帮助人民从自己的经验中认识美帝国主义与日本法西斯是一致的。在镇压反革命运动的报道中，又引导人民从活的事例中认识蒋、美、特务三者之间的关系。最近售棉储棉运动报道中，帮助农民认识了个人与国家的关系等。但这种情况的好转最主要的还是由于这些运动的本身带有很高的思想性，报纸本身还没有有意识地从政治思想上引导人民前进。华北各报普遍忽视对于武训传的讨论，重视了的也只是转载了人民日报的社论与文章，不做通俗解释，不打算引导群众讨论，经批评后才纠正，就是极明显的例证。
    所有这些情况说明了一个什么问题呢？说明了我们的新闻报道长期地习惯于就事论事的方法，不善于运用毛主席所给予我们的思想武器去分析和认识所要报道的事物，因此所抓取的便只是事物的现象。“活人活事”堆了很多，但能透彻地说明白“活道理”的很少。我们所学习的理论与报道的实践是脱节的。毛主席所教导我们“严重的问题在于教育农民”的话尽可以在口头上背得烂熟，但对于在农民中所产生的只顾发财不关心国家利益的现象却熟视无睹。爱国主义是一切工作中经常起作用的动力，但是在报纸上较好地表现这个主题，还是在轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动开展起来以后。新闻报道中脱离理论指导，不善于用马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想去分析和表现一切新鲜事物的意义，就是我们新闻报道中思想性不强的根本原因。
    但这并不是说，报纸在过去全无思想性。山西日报为了解决农民不关心国家利益的错误倾向，曾以李顺达为旗帜，进行了多次宣传，并发表了李顺达是生产模范又是爱国模范的社论。对于只强调困难不关心学生，以自己的主张一意孤行的太原师范校长，报纸开展了严肃的批评。河北日报在镇压反革命运动报道中，依据群众在各时期的不同思想认识，发表社论，加以分析，指出应该怎样正确的理解镇压反革命政策。绥远日报从加强与读报组的联系中，了解群众思想要求，使新闻报道进一步结合实际，报纸因而取得了显著的改进。这些做法是必须加以肯定与发扬的。为了今后能做到有系统有目的地宣传马克思列宁主义毛泽东思想，各地报纸有必要从以下几方面努力。
    第一，报纸工作者必须加强对于各种中心工作中群众思想情况的了解，并加以分析。比如报道目前农村的爱国丰产运动，就不能只是把某县某村的生产成绩与热情摆在报上，而应该深入地了解一下在不同觉悟的农民中对于爱国丰产竞赛的意义的了解，要表扬能正确理解爱国与丰产的关系的农民，教育那些只是知道丰产而不知道个人与国家关系的农民，批评不关心国家、也不积极生产的二流子思想。报纸的任务是要通过爱国丰产运动的报道使农民的觉悟提高一步，因此就不能满足于报道生产竞赛中的一些现象。要做到这一步，报纸就必须加强与读者的联系，加强对于实际情况的调查研究，报纸工作者就必须努力提高自己的马克思列宁主义的理论水平，加强分析能力。编报人如果还不能正确区分在各种运动中表现出来的无产阶级思想，农民思想，小资产阶级、资产阶级思想乃至敌对阶级思想的话，报纸就不可能正确地宣传马克思列宁主义毛泽东思想，报纸的思想性也就不可能提高。
    第二，依据对于中心工作中思想情况的了解与研究，确定重点，制订切实可行的报道计划。报道计划必须贯彻提高群众思想觉悟的精神，要求通过先进经验，先进人物的表扬，通过对于落后思想的批评，使人民对于毛泽东思想的体会提高一步，比如通过各界代表会中好坏典型的报道，我们就应帮助人民理解毛主席《论人民民主专政》的思想，通过物资交流及购棉储棉等报道帮助人民理解工农联盟思想等。
    第三，报纸在一定时期的宣传方针确定后，就应围绕中心，运用各种形式加强这方面的宣传。在开始转变过程中可能遇到稿件缺少的困难，但只要报纸所讨论与报道的真正接触了群众的思想，稿件的困难是容易解决的。山西日报在组织稷山反革命叛乱报道中，着重分析了其中的麻痹思想，各地读者很快就把这思想反映到报纸，报纸再抓住开展讨论，不只稿件来源不困难，而且进一步教育了人民。
    第四，报纸除加强中心工作报道的思想指导外，还应辟出专栏，有计划地开展思想批评，如为什么工人阶级是领导阶级、新民主主义国家与社会主义国家有什么区别、社会为什么必然要走向共产主义等问题，均应联系群众思想，开展一些批评与争论。过去报纸在这方面也做过一些解释，但由于没有抓住具体事件，具体人物所反映的思想而后提到理论原则上来讨论，因此争论不易展开。党的生活栏，也应组织一些有关党的性质、党的组织原则的思想讨论，而不应只平板地介绍一些模范党员。
    华北的各种工作正在逐步深入，各阶层人民在运动中所反映出的思想情况是很复杂的，我们的报纸必须担负起思想指导的任务来，使全体人民能分清敌我，能自觉地为保卫祖国建设祖国而努力。
