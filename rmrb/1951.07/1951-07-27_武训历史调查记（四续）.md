　　A Historical Investigation of Wu Xun (Continued-4)
    (4) Wu Xun's Usurious Exploitation
    Wu Xun Historical Investigation Team
    We concentrated the investigation of Wu Xun's schools in Liulin Town, and the investigation of Wu Xun's usury in Linqing Town. This is because Liulin is typical of Wu Xun's schools, while Linqing is typical of Wu Xun's usury.
    According to the materials we have obtained from the investigation, it can be proved that Wu Xun was a feudal exploiter who started as a hooligan, followed the will of the reactionary feudal rulers, used "establishing schools" as a stepping stone to get ahead, betrayed his own class, and climbed to the position of the ruling class. His exploitation methods were usurious lending, exploitation of land rent, house rent, and forced "charity". During the period in Linqing, from the sixteenth to the twenty-second year of Guangxu (1890-1896), Wu Xun's exploitation was mainly in the form of usury. At that time, his face was more clearly exposed to the laboring people of the time. He was a usurer who colluded with bureaucrats, had a special status, was greedy and cruel, and used harsh methods.
    How much property did Wu Xun have? Because the materials we have now are still very insufficient, this question cannot be answered definitively. Moreover, several materials differ. Most materials say that Wu Xun accumulated a total of more than 17,000 strings of cash in Tangyi, Guantao, and Linqing, of which more than 9,000 strings were in Tangyi, more than 5,000 strings in Guantao, and more than 3,000 strings in Linqing.
    This is what Zhuang Honglie, a Linqing prefectural official, said in his "Biography of Wu Xun's Portrait" written in the twenty-eighth year of Guangxu (1902) ("Wu Xun's 97th Birthday Commemorative Album," page 68). Another statement is that Wu Xun's property in Linqing was more than 3,000 strings of cash, but rather 2,000 taels of silver. A year after Wu Xun's death (1897, the twenty-third year of Guangxu), seventeen Linqing gentry, such as Zhang ?, Zhong Wei Yue, etc., twice petitioned the prefectural official for awards. In their petition (ibid., pages 81-83), this is how it was recorded.
    According to their records, the items and amounts of Wu Xun's estate in Linqing were as follows:
    I. A residence for the Yishu (free school) in Yushi Lane 400 taels
    II. Repair and addition costs 100 taels
    III. Pledged farmland, six mu 87 strings of cash
    IV. Purchased a shop 26 strings of cash
    V. A pawnshop 100 strings of cash
    VI. Lent to the Chao Guan (Customs) Scripture Dealers 600 taels
    VII. Lent to individual households Over 1,000 strings of cash
    The total amount is more than 2,000 taels. From the above table, except for the first and second items, totaling 500 taels, the remaining five items, totaling 1,500 taels, are all capital for his exploitation, and the investment in real estate is much smaller than the part for lending. Moreover, the origin of some real estate is still usury. The shop bought for 26 strings of cash (the tenant was a barber shop, which will be mentioned later in this article) was given to Wu Xun because the original owner was unable to repay the debt. Therefore, we say that Wu Xun's main form of exploitation in Linqing was usury.
    How many strings of cash was the seventh item, "lending to individual households over 1,000 strings"? According to the petition of Jin E'qiu, a licentiate who was one of the heads of the Linqing "Yishu" after Wu Xun's death ("A Complete Record of the Beginning and End of Establishing Schools," page 81), the lending to individual households amounted to 1,356 strings of cash from the seventeenth year of Guangxu to the year of Wu Xun's death, the twenty-second year.
    Wu Xun greedily sucked the interest exploited from this capital. Except for spending some on the hooligan gang and the "godmother" side, he was reluctant to spend a penny more. He turned all the interest he earned into capital and continued to "roll like a donkey," pursuing greater wealth. He endured hardship and wore rags, showing "firmness and perseverance" (Chiang Kai-shek: Biography and Praise of Mr. Wu Xun), on the one hand, to expand his exploitation capital; on the other hand, he had to maintain this "ascetic" appearance, "ending as a beggar," in order to continue to deceive and exploit. This miserly style of his is one of the characteristics of some landlord usurers in Chinese feudal society.
    It is true that in his income, in addition to what has been invested in school buildings and start-up fees, the interest generated by the remaining capital must be used as regular expenses for the school, such as paying teachers' salaries, etc., but it is clear that this is a necessary expense for him. Without this expense, he would not be able to become a big creditor, a big landlord, a big celebrity, and he would not be able to climb to the feet of the feudal rulers' throne.
    Now let's take a look at the exploitation situation of this big creditor in Linqing Town.
    The object of Wu Xun's heavy exploitation was the laboring people, but he rarely lent directly to the laboring people (especially in the last few years in Linqing), unless there was collateral. He didn't trust the poor, he "recognized money and didn't recognize people," said Kong Zhaowen, a 69-year-old porter in Linqing Town who had seen Wu Xun. Wu Xun often exploited the laboring people through landlords, gentry, silver houses, or local bullies and hooligans. His own song, "The poor use it, the rich guarantee it," illustrates this point. This was his principle for usurious lending.
    There is also an additional principle: it must be a family that "lasts for three generations." If the debtor died, Wu Xun could still find his descendants to settle the account. This was told to us by Zhao Mingxuan, an 85-year-old grocery store manager in Linqing Town. Two old people from Wu Village (both wealthy middle peasants), Wu Keke (78 years old) and Wu Jie (70 years old), who were from the same village as Wu Xun, and Lin Xueting (69 years old, middle peasant) from Qiao Village, also said that Wu Doumo only lent to those with "three generations of descendants." They also remembered that Wu Xun often sang a song with curses and threats while lending money: "Whoever pits me, Wu Qi, the old and the young will not have a good life. First grow sores, then get sick, people will die and the family will be ruined."
    Whether Wu Xun lent money in Tangyi, Guantao, or Linqing, the interest rate was the highest standard at the time, 3% per month. This was unanimously affirmed by the people investigated in the above-mentioned places. But there were exceptions. When he deposited money with landlords, wealthy gentry, or silver houses, and they re-lent it at usurious rates, the interest rate would only be slightly lower than the highest standard, so that the landlords could also get some benefits for handling the lending for him, that is, cooperating in lending and sharing the benefits. For example, the 600 taels lent to the Chao Guan Scripture Dealers had an interest rate of 2.2%, as recorded in Zhang?'s petition. This situation was relatively rare. Most of Wu Xun's loans were still at 3% interest, which was higher than usual. Liang Qichao also did not shy away from saying in his biography of Wu Xun: "The interest is heavier than usual." Yu Mingxuan, a 70-year-old scholar, proved that Wu Xun's 3% interest was public and legal, and ordinary people could not do it. According to him, in the Qing Dynasty, there was a rule in the local area that if the government found that the interest rate was 3% when judging debt lawsuits, the official could confiscate the debt. But Wu Xun could ignore these things.
    Zhao Jingbo, a 76-year-old wealthy merchant, also confirmed this point. He remembered that Wu Xun often lent money to well-established shops at 3% monthly interest, settled monthly. He also said that if poor people wanted to use his money, they had to have collateral.
    Guo Huating (38 years old, middle peasant), who is now a teacher at Linqing Wu Xun Elementary School (the successor of Linqing "Yishu"), said that he had heard his grandmother say such a thing in the past. Wu Xun begged for money in their village. When people didn't give him money, saying they didn't have any, Wu Xun immediately took out the money and said: "I have money, I'll lend it to you." He just forced it on people like that. Of course, that person was a "good household" that Wu Xun estimated could repay the principal and interest.
    As long as Wu Xun accumulated a string of cash, he would take it to deposit with landlords and well-established merchants. The method he often used was to kneel down and kowtow. "One string of cash costs 30 cash per month," said Ji Xiting, a 73-year-old poor peasant. He had partnered with someone to open a money shop in the Qing Dynasty.
    In addition to Linqing Town, Wu Xun also often went to the surrounding villages to operate. Li Huilan, a large landlord in Xiaochang Village, was one of Wu Xun's usurious lending partners. Li Tingyang, a landlord in Hexi, was also one. Wei Junzhe (poor peasant, who used to be a yamen servant, 73 years old) and Zhang Zishou (middle peasant, who used to open a money shop, 70 years old) still remembered such things.
    Wu Xun did his utmost to be servile to these usurious lending partners of his. Zhao Mingxuan, mentioned above, told us: Once, Wu Doumo went to the house of Zhang Dongying, a landlord Jinshi (successful candidate in the imperial examinations) in Laoguanzhai, Hexi, to lend money. Zhang Dongying not only refused, but also clashed with him and slapped Wu Doumo. Ten days later, Wu Doumo went to Zhang's house again, apologized to Zhang Dongying, and carefully asked: "Jinshi Master! Are you still angry?" This matter was circulated among the people and was real.
    But Wu Xun's main backer in Linqing was not those ordinary landlords and wealthy households, but Shi Shanzheng, who helped him run the "Yishu" in Yushi Lane. He relied on him, lived in his house ("When he lived in Shi Shanzheng's house in Chao Guan Street, his reputation grew greatly," see Chen Enpu: Wu Xun's Stele Inscription for Establishing Schools), and also died in his house (one said that when he was seriously ill, he moved from Shi's house to the Yixue (free school) to die). What kind of person was this Shi Shanzheng? He was one of the four hereditary tax farmers of the Linqing Customs, the "Scripture Dealers" - commonly known as "Jing Cheng" - and the head of the four, a local tyrant in Linqing. He lived a very luxurious life. The old people in Linqing said he "ate and wore everything to the extreme."
    Linqing Zhili Prefecture was an important wharf on the Grand Canal, the main transportation route between the north and the south. The tax revenue of Linqing Customs was very large and directly managed by the prefectural official. The "Linqing County Chronicle" says: "Linqing Customs was founded in the early Ming Dynasty... In the middle of Qianlong, the Linqing prefectural magistrate was specially appointed to manage the tax affairs concurrently. At that time, the amount of tax paid was often six or seven thousand taels, or two or three thousand taels. The remaining extractions all went into their own pockets" (Volume 4, page 11). Although successive prefectural officials seized this business and never let go, they could not personally go out to make money. He entrusted this matter to the tax farmer "Jing Cheng" to do. They colluded with each other and cheated together. At that time, Shi Shanzheng and other "Jing Cheng" paid the Manchu autocratic court 66,000 taels of tax silver every year, and the excess money was divided among them. There is still a saying circulating in Linqing today, called "Is it enough, 66,000," which shows how sensational this business was at that time. Some old people in Linqing now say that the total income could reach ten times the tax silver, and some say it was two or three times. According to the "Linqing County Chronicle," the estimated total was at least 250,000 or 260,000 taels (ibid., previous page).
    This number was the total amount of tax paid in 1900 (the twenty-sixth year of Guangxu) after another prefectural official, Du Binyin, took office and "eliminated accumulated malpractices." Du investigated and dealt with Shi Shanzheng and other four major "Jing Cheng." This is according to Liu Jizhong. He is 62 years old this year, is a poor peasant, and used to run a printing shop.
    But this happened four years after Wu Xun's death. When Wu Xun was alive, Shi Shanzheng of Linqing was one of the richest and most powerful figures in the local area, and the "beggar" Wu Doumo clung to such a good person. The Linqing "Yixue" was contracted by him, and the large amount of usurious lending was handled by him. This Shi Shanzheng, like the executioner Yang Shufang, became a remarkable "enlightened gentleman" in the writings of Sun Yu and Li Shizhao.
    The reason why Shi Shanzheng wanted to use Wu Xun is very obvious. Shi Shanzheng was a tax farmer with a very large income, and he had to adopt various methods to maintain his coveted lucrative position. He had run a "Charity Association" to distribute porridge every winter; he had controlled an organization called "Daxianhui" (one of the predecessors of Yiguandao), which lectured and distributed good books through spirit writing. The good books sold by Wu Xun, in addition to those from the good book association he ran in Zhao Langzhai, Tangyi, were taken from there. His support for Wu Xun in running "Yixue" was beneficial to his tax farming. The "righteous" act covered up the exploitation. This hereditary, but untitled tax merchant, must have had a lot of contact with the "Five-Day Capital Official" (the Linqing prefectural officials were often replaced, and some were transferred in a few months) of the government, and Wu Xun at that time was already a prominent figure who frequently entered and exited the government. The Shandong Governor Zhang Yao, "imperial commissioner for assisting in naval affairs, junior guardian of the crown prince, minister of the Ministry of War," hung the plaque "Le Shan Hao Shi" (Happy to Do Good and Give) "presented upon request" by Emperor Guangxu in Liulin Town, and kept Zhang Yao's awarded yellow silk "official donation register" in his bag. He had "visited all the successive academies and neighboring prefectures, halls, states, and counties" (Liu Zizhou: Biography of the Righteous Schoolmaster Wu Gong), "All the prefectural magistrates, county magistrates, and even the governors and commissioners of the province, all expressed their admiration" (Sha Mingyuan: A Record of Wu Xun's Establishment of Schools). It was of course very beneficial to Shi Shanzheng to have such a "benevolent man" who was favored by the feudal rulers under his control at home.
    At that time, Wu Xun's close relationship with the government and his high reputation in the ruling class and upper-class society, in addition to the above-mentioned written records that can be used to prove it, can also be corroborated by the words of Li Hanbang (86 years old, poor peasant), who used to be a shield armor soldier: "No one dared to provoke Wu Qi, and the prefectural official Tao Xiqi did not treat him as an outsider."
    The stories we heard among the laboring people even more showed Wu Xun's face of colluding with bureaucrats. Kong Zhaowen, the porter mentioned above, told a story. Wu Xun lent 20 strings of cash to a yamen servant named Zhang. The yamen servant was a hooligan and wanted to embezzle the money. Wu Xun's solution was to sleep at the yamen gate overnight. The next morning, Wu Xun grabbed a pile of his own feces and wanted to eat it. People passing by gathered around to watch the strange thing. Wu Xun shouted that Zhang yamen servant should repay the debt, and the matter became known. This matter could not but be known to the prefectural official Tao Xiqi. It was really unsightly for the famous Wu Xun to lie at his yamen gate eating feces and refusing to leave, so he had to order the Zhang yamen servant to quickly return the principal and interest to Wu Xun. Kong Zhaowen said: "Look at how capable Wu Doumo is, even the yamen servants dare not cheat him of his money, he has connected with high officials." When this nearly 70-year-old porter talked about Zhang yamen servant, he also took off his clothes and twisted them into a rope, as a braid, put it on his head, and clenched his fists, vividly describing the hooligan's arrogant demeanor. But even such a hooligan that the common people feared like a tiger was no match for Wu Xun, a more powerful hooligan.
    Wu Xun relied on the powerful and influential, lending money and collecting interest. In Linqing, in addition to Shi Shanzheng running it for him, he also lent tens of strings of cash to the silver houses, shops, and landlords in Linqing.
    At that time, Linqing was a place for the exchange of goods between the north and the south, with grain ships coming and going in an endless stream, and the market was prosperous. There were as many as seventy or eighty silver houses (including small money shops) that exchanged silver ingots, small silver, and issued bank notes. The three largest were: "Jiyuan" on Mashi Street, "Juxing" on Guoshi Street, and "Yonghengzeng" at the mouth of Qingwanshi. The old people in Linqing said that there was a saying at the time called: "South Jiyuan, North Juxing, with Yonghengzeng in the middle."
    These three major silver houses each had affiliated houses. "Jiyuan," "Jichang," "Jitai"... were called "Ji Zihao" (Ji-character firm), all opened by Xu Datou (Big Head Xu), the large landlord in Nianzi Lane. "Juxing," "Baoxing," "Yuxing"... were called "Xing Zihao" (Xing-character firm), all opened by Ji Yaozu "Ji Lao Yao" (Old Yao Ji), who owned thirty hectares of land in the countryside and more than a hundred shops in the town. "Yonghengzeng," "Yongyuhou"... were called "Yong Zihao" (Yong-character firm), all opened by the Sun family "Sun Baiqing" (Sun Hundred Hectares), the large landlord in Dongdaxinzhuang.
    According to the investigation, Wu Xun had relations with these three large landlords, either lending money to them personally or lending money to the firms they opened. The amount of money deposited was about twenty or thirty strings of cash each time, or fifty or sixty strings.
    The above materials were provided by Guo Zongzhou (teahouse owner, 67 years old), Zhang Qinxuan (urban poor, 73 years old), and Li Yuling (peddler, who used to be a yamen servant, 69 years old).
    How Wu Xun lent money through local bullies and hooligans was said by Wei Junzhe, who used to be a yamen servant. Wei used to know a peddler who sold chicken intestines. The peddler's wife was a gambler and often used Wu Doumo's money, with each amount not exceeding two strings, and an interest rate of 3%. Wu Doumo was afraid that she would cheat, so he only lent for one month at a time, and the principal and interest were repaid at the end of the term. There was also a hooligan gambler named Lü Layueer, and Wu Doumo also often lent usurious loans to those who sold buns, did small businesses, and sold paper ingots through him on the lower street. Wei Junzhe lived on Yaowangmiao Street at that time, and often saw Wu Doumo going there every few days to lend and collect debts, but they were all small amounts.
    Wu Xun occasionally lent money directly to the laboring people, but even more fully exposed his cruel and merciless usurer's face.
    Zhang Qinxuan, who has already been mentioned above, knew that Wu Doumo had lent a sum of money (about ten strings) to two gatekeepers who managed the canal locks, named Shen Guangtai and Yin Chengfang, who were two coolies. In order to guard the river day and night on the canal at the head lock, the two built a small house on the river bank. Wu Xun used this small house as collateral for this loan. After borrowing this "rolling donkey," they were no longer able to repay it. Wu Xun exercised his creditor's rights and confiscated the house. After Wu Xun confiscated the two coolies' small mud-walled house that sheltered them from the wind and rain, he rented it to a barber who opened a barber shop at the mouth of the canal, where boatmen often rested. The new landlord, Wu Doumo, went to collect the rent every month, 800 cash per month. The "A Complete Record of the Beginning and End of Establishing Schools" also mentioned this small house and said that the barber's surname was Wang (page 83). This house is still there now, and we took a photo of it. Zhang Qinxuan expressed his opinion on this matter: "The poor dare not owe him money, the yamen is there to collect the debt for him."
    Zhu Jingbo, a 78-year-old traditional Chinese medicine doctor, said that he had a relative in Jiao Village, five miles north of Liulin Town. That year, he was sixteen years old and went to visit his relatives. It was snowing that day, and he met Wu Qi in the field. He looked different from usual, with his back bent and carrying a wooden box. Zhu was very strange and asked him what he was doing. Wu Xun told him. It turned out that a peddler who strung books and sold them owed Wu Xun a debt and could no longer repay it, so Wu Qi confiscated the book box.
    Among some of the people we visited above, all of them who were laboring people said that they looked down on Wu Xun at that time, so they called him "Doumo" (Bean Curd Residue) and "Han Qi" (Silly Seven); and because he was greedy for money, they said he was "obsessed with money"; or in the local dialect, "obsessed with money turned around."
    They said that he didn't talk much to the poor, and the poor didn't pay attention to him, "no one paid attention to anyone," "the poor have nothing to give him, why would he talk to the poor?" Wu Xun walked on the street, always lowering his head, not looking at people, but he would never miss the doors of "good households" and large shops. He either went to beg for alms or to lend and collect debts. Only the houses of landlords, gentry, and the yamen were places that Wu Xun often went to. People said: "Doumo can enter and leave the yamen at will, and even the dogs don't bite him." Someone even said it better: "Human eyes can't see through Doumo, but dog eyes can."
    The facts are very clear. Wu Xun was neither a laboring person nor had anything to do with the laboring people. Or rather, there was only one relationship, and that was the relationship between exploitation and being exploited.
    They also said that the nickname "Doumo" means not so much "confused" as "having no backbone" or "having no courage." They said that Wu Doumo was not confused at all, and he was even less confused when it came to lending money. Chen Maolin, a 65-year-old urban poor (who used to work as a broker), had heard that Wu Xun had many knots tied on his belt to mark the debts he had lent out so that he would not make mistakes. The landlord class praised such a shrewd and harsh typical usurer: "From one cash to a thousand cash, the accumulation of interest, in countless ways, and the daily interest, monthly interest, and annual interest are even more mixed and varied, and all kinds of changes occur. Xun neither knew how to read nor was familiar with mathematics, but relied on his heart to remember, so the slightest odd number was all summarized. Therefore, as a creditor for decades, there was never any debt dispute" (Sha Mingyuan: A Complete Record of the Beginning and End of Establishing Schools). The last sentence fully reveals their admiration and envy for such an outstanding usurer who colluded with the government and relied on the powerful, so no one dared to miss a penny of his account.
    But what attitude did Li Shizhao and Sun Yu take towards Wu Xun's usurious lending?
    Li Shizhao adopted an attitude of calling a stag a horse, reversing black and white: "Low-interest loans to poor peasants to buy land... to fully develop their productivity and protect their lives" ("Wu Xun Picture Album," page 98).
    Sun Yu adopted an attitude of "beautifying" and praising it to the fullest: "It was another bright spring day; the two peach trees in front of Xiao Tao's grave were full of flowers. Wu Xun, fifty years old, sat on the roots of a wild chestnut tree that two people could embrace, happily listening to Maolin talking about the total account of money accumulated over the past twenty years... When the breeze rose, a few small butterflies flew over and got lost in a shower of fragrant rain of falling flowers" (Film Novel "The Story of Wu Xun," page 157).
    But, readers, we should not be lost in such an elaborately arranged lie!

(End of this section, the whole text is not finished) (With pictures)
      Wu Xun frequently went to the houses of landlords and wealthy gentry
    This is the gate of the Xu family in Linqing Nianzi Lane. Xu was a large landlord, a wealthy gentry, and the owner of the large silver house "Jiyuan." Wu Xun often went to "Jiyuan" to deposit money and enter and exit the "Daifu Mansion." Now this house has been taken over by the public and serves as the Chamber of Commerce. The paint on the plaque of the gate has faded, but the gold color of the three characters "Daifu Mansion" is still shining, and you can imagine the power at that time.
    Remnants of the brick city wall of Dongguan in Linqing
    The Taiping Army defended this place more than 100 years ago, and the Qing army broke through it, burning and killing on a large scale. The streets were razed to farmland, and it is still desolate today. We visited a shield armor soldier at that time in Dongguan, and he said that Wu Xun and Changshi Zhouguan and others all had contacts.
    The house that Wu Xun confiscated from the coolies
    This is a house at the head lock of the Linqing Canal. It was originally built by two gatekeepers. Because they owed Wu Xun usurious loans and could not repay them, Wu Xun confiscated it to offset the debt. After Wu Xun took it as his own, he rented it to a barber named Wang and went to collect rent every month. After liberation, this house, together with the school property, was nationalized. It is still inhabited, but no one collects rent anymore.

　　武训历史调查记（四续）
    （四）武训的高利贷剥削
    武训历史调查团
    我们将武训学校的调查集中在柳林镇，将武训高利贷的调查集中在临清镇。这是因为武训的学校，柳林是典型，而武训的高利贷，则临清是典型。
    根据我们调查所得的材料，可以证明：武训是一个以流氓起家，遵从反动封建统治者的意志，以“兴学”为进身之阶，叛离其本阶级，爬上统治阶级地位的封建剥削者。他的剥削方法，就是高利放债，剥削地租、房租和强迫“布施”。在临清的时期，从光绪十六年到二十二年（一八九○年——一八九六年），武训所进行的剥削，其主要形式为高利贷。那时候，他的面貌更加清楚地暴露在当时的劳动人民之前。他是一个勾结官僚，地位特殊，居心贪残，手段苛刻的高利贷者。
    武训究竟有多少财产？由于我们现在得到的材料还很不充分，这个问题不能确定地回答。而且几种材料，互有出入。多数材料说武训前后在堂邑、馆陶、临清所积财产总数为一万七千余吊，其中堂邑九千余吊，馆陶五千余吊，临清三千余吊。
    临清州官庄洪烈于光绪二十八年（一九○二年）所作《武训遗像记》（《武训先生九七诞辰纪念册》第六十八页）中，就是这样说的。另一说是武训在临清的财产不止三千吊，而是二千两银子。武训死后一年（一八九七年，光绪二十三年）临清州绅士张?、钟维岳等十七人，曾两次禀请州官给奖。在他们的禀状（同前书第八十一至八十三页）里，就是这样记载的。
    根据他们的记载，武训在临清遗产的项目和数量是这样：
    一、御史巷义塾宅房一所                              四百两
    二、修理和添建费                                    一百两
    三、当田地六亩                                    八十七吊
    四、买铺房一所                                    二十六吊
    五、当铺房一所                                      一百吊
    六、贷放给钞关经书                                  六百两
    七、零户贷放                                      一千余吊
    合计总数为二千余两。从上表看，除第一、二项共五百两外，其余五项共一千五百两都是他进行剥削的资本，而其中投资在房地产上的，比起放债的部分来，要小得多。而且一部分房产，其来历也还是高利贷。买价二十六吊的那所铺房（租户为一剃头铺，本文后面还要提到）就是原屋主无力偿债，折给武训的。因此我们说武训在临清的主要剥削方式是高利贷。
    第七项零户贷放一千余吊，究竟是多少吊呢？根据武训死后临清“义塾”首事人之一增生靳鹗秋的禀状（《兴学始末记》第八十一页），从光绪十七年到二十二年武训死为止，零户放债部分为一千三百五十六吊。
    武训贪婪地吮吸着用这笔资本剥削得来的利息，除流氓帮内和“干娘”方面，他必然要花费一些以外，他舍不得多花一文。他把所得的利息，再全部转为资本，继续“驴打滚”，追求更大的财产。他吃得苦，穿得破，“坚苦卓绝”（蒋介石：武训先生传赞），一方面是为了可以扩大他的剥削资本；一方面也是为了必须保持这“苦行”的外形，“以乞丐终”，才能继续欺骗，进行剥削。他的这种守财奴式的作风是中国封建社会中一部分地主高利贷者的特性之一。
    不错，在他的收入中，除已投在学校校舍和开办费上以外，其余资本所生利息无论如何总还要抽出一点来用为学校的经常费，如付教师束修等，但是很显然，这是他不得不花的一点开销，没有这点开销，他就当不成大债主、大地主、大名人，也爬不到封建统治者的宝座脚边去了。
    现在让我们来看看这个大债主在临清镇的剥削情形。
    武训进行重利盘剥的对象是劳动人民，但他直接放债给劳动人民的时候却很少（特别是在临清的最后几年当中），除非有抵押品。他不相信穷人，他“认钱不认人”，这是临清镇上一个见过武训的今年六十九岁的搬运工人孔昭文说的。武训经常通过地主、绅士、银钱号，或者地痞、流氓，去剥削劳动人民。他自己的歌《穷的使，富的保》，就说明了这件事。这是他放高利贷的原则。
    还有一条附带的原则：必须是“够三辈”的人家。债务人死了，武训还可以找他的后辈算账。这是临清镇上一个八十五岁的杂货店经理赵名选告诉我们的。和武训同村的武庄的两个老年人（成份都是富裕中农）武克科（七十八岁）、武玠（七十岁）和乔庄的林雪亭（六十九岁，中农）也都说，武豆沫要“三辈人烟”才放。他们还记得，武训一面放债，一面常唱这样一个带着诅咒和威胁意味的歌：“谁要把我武七坑，老的少的不安生。先长疮，后生病，人亡家破死个净。”
    武训无论在堂邑，在馆陶、在临清放债，其利率都是当时的最高标准，月利三分。这是上述各地被调查的人所一致肯定的。但也有例外，他向地主豪绅或银号存钱，由他们转放高利贷，利率就只能比最高标准低一些，以便地主他们为他经手放债，也得到一部分好处，也就是说合作放债，利益均沾。例如放给钞关经书的六百两，其利率为二分二厘，这是张?禀状上载的。这种情形比较少、武训的多数放款还是三分利，比普通要高。梁启超在给武训作的传记中也不讳言：“息则视常加重。”今年七十岁的秀才于明轩，证明武训放三分利是公开的，合法的，普通人不行。据他说，在满清时代，当地有这么一条规矩，衙门里判断债务官司，如果发现放的是三分利，官可以没收债款。可是武训却可以不顾这些。
    七十六岁的富商赵镜波也证实了这点。他记得武训常放钱给殷实铺户，三分行息，按月结账。他也说，如果穷人要使他的钱，就必须有抵押品。
    现在在临清武训小学（临清“义塾”的后身）当教员的郭华庭（三十八岁，中农）谈，他过去曾听见他的祖母说过这样的事。武训在他们村上乞钱，当人家不给他，说没有钱的时候，武训马上掏出钱来说：“我有钱，我放给你。”他就这样硬放给人。当然，那人是武训估计能够回本付息的“好户”。
    武训只要积满一吊钱，就拿去存放给地主和殷实买卖家。他经常采用的办法是跪下磕头。“一吊钱每月要三十个制钱的利”，这是贫农冀熙亭（七十三岁）讲的。他在满清时代和人家合伙开过钱铺。
    除了临清镇上，附近乡村中，武训亦常去活动。校场村大地主李惠兰是武训的高利贷合作者之一。河西地主李廷扬也是一个。魏浚哲（贫民，过去曾做衙役，商人，七十三岁）、张紫绶（中农，过去曾开过钱铺，七十岁）都还记得有这样的事。
    武训对他的这些高利贷合作者是极尽奴颜婢膝之能事的。上面所提到的赵名选告诉我们：有一回，武豆沫上河西老官寨地主进士张东瀛家去放钱。张东瀛不但拒绝，并且和他冲突起来，打了武豆沫一巴掌。过了十来天，武豆沫又去张家，向张东瀛赔罪，小心问好：“进士老爷！你还生气不生气？”这事曾为人们所传，是实在的。
    但武训在临清的主要的靠山还不是那些普通的地主富户，而是那个替他办御史巷“义塾”的施善政。他投靠了他，住在他家（“寓钞关街施善政家时，声誉大著”，见陈恩普：武训先生兴学碑文），也死在他家（一说是病到严重时，从施家搬到义学去死的）。这个施善政是怎样一个人呢？他是临清钞关世袭四大包税者《经书》——俗称《经程》——之一，并且是四个当中的头一把交椅，临清的一霸。他生活得很是阔绰，临清的老年人说他“吃尽穿绝”。
    临清直隶州是当时南北运输要道——运河上的重要码头之一，临清关的税收为数颇巨，由州官直接经管。《临清县志》云：“临清钞关创自明初。……乾隆中叶专委临清州牧兼理税务。其时所解税款多或六、七万两，少或二、三万两。其余浮收，则均归中饱”（第四册第十一页）。历任州官虽则抓住这个买卖决不放松，但他究竟不能亲自动手去捞钱。他把这件事委托给包税者“经程”去干。上下合伙，通同作弊。那时候，施善政等“经程”向满清专制朝廷每年包缴税银六万六千两，多余的钱由他们分赃。临清至今仍流传一句话，叫做“够不够，六万六”，可见这个买卖在当时是如何耸人听闻。现在临清的一些老人们说，全部收入可达包银的十倍，有的说是二三倍。据《临清县志》所载，估计至少是二十五、六万两（同前书前页）。
    这数目是一九○○年（光绪二十六年）另一州官杜宾寅到任，“清除积弊”后，所缴的税收总额。杜查办了施善政等四大“经程”。这是根据刘季重说的。他今年六十二岁，是贫民，过去开过印刷字号。
    但这件事的发生，已在武训死后四年。当武训在时，临清施善政是当地数一数二的有钱有势的人物，而“乞丐”武豆沫就巴结上了这样一个好人。临清的“义学”是他包办的，大宗的高利贷是他经手的。这个施善政，就像杀人刽子手杨树坊一样，到了孙瑜、李士钊们的笔下，又成了一位了不起的“开明绅士”。
    施善政所以要利用武训，理由是很明显的。施善政是个收入极多的包税者，他必须采用种种方法来保持他的受人觊觎的肥缺。他曾办“募善会”，每到冬季施粥；他曾控制一个名为“大仙会”（一贯道前身之一）的组织，扶乩讲道，散发善书。武训所出售的善书，除了他自己在堂邑赵郎砦办的善书会以外，即取自该处。他支持武训办“义学”，对他的包税是有利的，“义”举掩盖了括削。这个世袭的，但是没有官衔的包税商人，自须与“五日京兆”（临清州官时常撤换，有几个月就调动的）的官府多多联络，而武训在当时已是一个煊赫一时出入官府的人物，柳林镇上挂着“钦差帮办海军大臣太子少保头品顶戴兵部尚书”山东巡抚张曜“奏奉”光绪皇帝所赐的“乐善好施”匾额，褡子里藏着张曜所赏的黄绫“官捐簿”，他曾“遍谒历任学院及邻邑府厅州县”（刘子舟：义学正武公传），“所有州牧县令，以至抚藩臬道，亦各表钦慕之诚”（沙明远：纪武训兴学始末）。施善政能控制这样一个为封建统治者所宠视的“善士”在家里，当然对他有百利而无一弊。
    那时候，武训和官府关系之密切，在统治阶级上流社会中声望之隆，除了上面这些文字记载可资证明外，曾在当时当过盾甲兵的李汉邦（八十六岁，贫民）的话，也可参证：“武七，没人敢惹他，州官陶锡祺也不当他是外人。”
    我们在劳动人民中听到的故事，更显得出武训勾结官僚的面目。上面提到过的搬运工人孔昭文讲了一个故事。武训放了二十吊钱给一个姓张的衙役，那衙役是个流氓，想吞没这笔钱。武训对付的办法是睡在衙门口过夜。到第二天早晨，武训抓起自己拉的一堆屎要吃，过路的人围着看奇事。武训嚷着要张衙役还债，这件事就闹开了。这事不能不闹得州官陶锡祺也知道了，大名鼎鼎的武训躺在自己的衙门口吃屎，死也不肯走，实在不像样子，只得命令那个张衙役赶快把本利一并还给武训。孔昭文说：“你看武豆沫本领多么大，衙役都不敢坑他的钱，他连络上了大官儿。”这位年近七十的搬运工人谈到张衙役的时候，还脱下衣服绞成一股，当作发辫，盘在头上，两手握拳，生动地形容了一下这个流氓的蛮横神气。可就是这样一个老百姓畏之如虎的流氓，也不是武训这个更厉害的流氓的对手。
    武训依附权贵，放债收息，在临清这地方，除有施善政为他经营外，他还把成十吊的钱，放给临清的银钱号、商店和地主。
    那时候临清为南北货物交流之地，粮船络绎，市面繁荣。单是兑换元宝、碎银、放款出帖（银票）的银钱号（包括小的钱铺）就有七、八十家。最大的三家是：马市街的“际元”、锅市街的“聚兴”、青碗市口的“永亨增”。临清老人们说，当时有一句俗话叫做：“南际元，北聚兴，中间夹着个永亨增。”
    这三家大银号各有联号。“际元”、“际昌”、“际泰”……叫做“际字号”，都是碾子巷大地主徐家“徐大头”所开设。“聚兴”、“宝兴”、“玉兴”……叫做“兴字号”，都是在乡下拥有三十顷土地，在镇上拥有一百来家铺子的冀耀祖“冀老耀”所开设。“永亨增”、“永馀厚”……叫做“永字号”，都是东大辛庄大地主孙家“孙百顷”所开设。
    据调查，武训与这三个大地主都有关系，不是放钱给他们本人，便是放钱给他们所开设的字号。存放钱数每次约二、三十吊，或五、六十吊。
    供给上项材料的是郭宗周（茶馆掌柜，六十七岁）、张琴轩（城市贫民，七十三岁）、李玉岭（小贩，过去曾做衙役，六十九岁）。
    武训怎样通过地痞流氓去放高利贷，是过去曾做衙役的魏浚哲说的。魏曾经认识一个卖鸡肠子的小贩。小贩的老婆是个赌鬼，经常使武豆沫的钱，每次数目不超过两吊，利息三分。武豆沫怕她坑账，每次只放一个月，到期本利清还。还有一个流氓赌棍叫吕腊月儿，武豆沫也经常通过他把高利贷放给下街卖包子的、做小买卖的、卖纸元宝的。魏浚哲那时住药王庙街，常见武豆沫三天两头上那儿去放账收账，但都是小注儿的。
    武训也偶而直接放钱给劳动人民，但更充分暴露了他的残酷无情的高利贷者的面目。
    上面已经说过的张琴轩，知道武豆沫放过一笔钱（十吊左右）给两个管理运河闸门的闸夫，名叫沈广泰、尹成方，是两个苦力。两人为了日夜在头闸口运河上守河的需要，在那河岸上盖了一间小屋。武训这笔借款即把这间小屋作抵。他们借了这笔“驴打滚”后，再也无力偿付。武训执行债权，把这间屋子没收。武训没收了这两个苦力的遮蔽风雨的泥打墙的小屋后，租给了一个剃头的，在那经常有船夫歇脚的运河口上，开了一爿剃头铺。新房东武豆沫按月去收房租，每月八百文。《兴学始末记》上也提到这所小屋，并说那剃头铺姓王（第八十三页）。这房子现在还在，我们拍了照片。张琴轩对这件事发表了他的意见：“穷人那敢欠他的，有衙门替他收账呢。”
    七十八岁的中医朱镜波说，他在柳林镇的北面五里地焦庄有一家亲戚。那年他十六岁，去亲戚家作客。那天正下雪，在田野里碰到了武七，样子不跟平时一样，弯着背，背了一只木箱。朱很奇怪，问他干么。武训告诉了他。原来一个串书馆的卖书小贩欠了武训一笔债，再也还不起，武七便把那只书箱没收了。
    在我们所访问的上面的一些人中，凡属劳动人民，都说，当时他们都看不起武训，所以叫他“豆沫”、“憨七”；又因为他贪钱如命，所以说他是“财迷”；或者用当地土话来说，是“财迷转向”。
    他们讲他不大跟穷人拉话，穷人家也不睬他，“谁也不答理谁”，“穷人又没有什么给他，他跟穷人说话干么呀？”武训走在街上，老低着头，不看人，但决不会差过“好户”和大铺子的门，他不是去募化，便是去放债要债。只有地主、绅士家和衙门是武训经常去跑的。人们说：“豆沫随意进出官衙门，狗都不咬他。”有人更说得好：“人眼看不透豆沫，狗眼却看得透。”
    事实已很明白，武训既不是劳动人民，也和劳动人民没有什么关系。或者说，只有一种关系，那就是剥削与被剥削的关系。
    他们还说“豆沫”这绰号的意思，与其说是“糊涂”，不如说他“没有骨头”、“没有一点刚气”。他们说，武豆沫哪里糊涂，在放账上更不糊涂。六十五岁的城市贫民陈茂林（过去曾作经纪）听说过，武训在腰带上打着许多结，用来标记他放出的账项，不会弄错。对这样一个精明苛刻的典型高利贷者，地主阶级歌颂道：“自一缗至千缗，其利之相积，错落万端，而日利、月利、年利又纷歧杂揉，变幻无不至。训既不知书，复不通数理，惟恃一心记忆，则纤微奇零，无弗综贯。故身为债权者数十年，未尝有债务纠葛事”（沙明远：兴学始末记）。后面这一句话，充分流露了他们对这样一个勾结官府，倚仗豪门，因此谁也不敢少他一文账的杰出的高利贷者的赞叹和羡慕。
    但李士钊和孙瑜，对武训的高利放债采取了什么态度呢？
    李士钊采取了指鹿为马、颠倒黑白的态度：“低利贷款给贫农买地……以充分发挥他们的生产力，保障他们的生活”（《武训画传》第九八页）。
    孙瑜采取了加以“美化”、尽情歌颂的态度：“又是一个明媚的春日；小桃墓前的两株桃树开满了花。五十岁的武训坐在两人合抱的野栗子大树根，欣然听着茂林向他细谈二十年来的积钱总账。……微风起处，几个小蝴蝶翩翩飞过，迷失在落花的一阵香雨中”（电影小说《武训传》第一五七页）。
    但是，读者们，我们是不应该迷失在这样一个精巧布置的谎话的迷魂阵中去的！
                                            （本节完，全文未完）（附图片）
      武训经常出入的地主豪绅家
    这是临清碾子巷徐家大门。徐是大地主、大豪绅，又是大银号“际元”的老板。武训常去“际元”存款，出入“大夫第”。现在这屋子已归公家，作为商会会所。大门匾额油漆已褪色，但“大夫第”三字的金色仍旧闪着光亮，可以想见当时的威风。
    临清砖城东关残垣
    太平军在一百余年前守此，清兵攻破之，大肆烧杀，城内有两处万人坑。市街被夷为田畴，至今荒凉一片。我们曾在东关内访问当时的一个盾甲兵，他说武训和常时州官等均有交往。
    武训没收苦力的屋子
    这是临清运河上头闸口的一所屋子，原系两个闸夫所建，因欠武训高利贷，无法清偿，被武训没收抵债。武训据为己有后，出租给王姓理发铺，每月去收租。解放后此屋连同学校校产一起归公。现仍有人住，但无人去收租了。
