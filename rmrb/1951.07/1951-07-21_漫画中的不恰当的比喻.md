Inappropriate Metaphors in Cartoons
	Fang Cheng

Using metaphors is one of the main expressive methods of cartoons, but choosing correct and appropriate metaphors requires careful consideration and serious selection by the author, especially focusing on the essence of things and their internal connections, grasping the common ground between the metaphor and the issue to be expressed, to arouse the reader's associative power. Otherwise, it will distort and damage the essence of the issue being expressed.

Some readers' letters criticizing several cartoons recently are examples of unilaterally and formally misusing metaphors, resulting in the opposite effect in propaganda.

For example, a cartoon made by Comrade Yu Baishu on the cover of Prospect magazine, volume 7, issue 17, depicts Truman sitting on a cart full of munitions going down a hill, with a thin and weak cow pulling the cart. The words "British People" are written on the cow. Attlee and Bevan are leading the cow. Bevan throws away the whip, puts his hand on his forehead, and says to Attlee pessimistically: "I can no longer serve the military expansion and war preparation policy that follows the US imperialists to the dead end of bankrupting Britain."

Such a metaphor is extremely inappropriate. To compare the British people, who are standing on the same front line as us in striving for peace and opposing aggressive war, to a thin and ugly cow raised by the warmongers, the author obviously has not recognized his own position, has no comradely sympathy for the British people, and has no hatred for the enemy; at the same time, the author has not seen the growing strength of the British people today. The broad masses of the British people are constantly demanding that the government not follow the policies of the United States through various means such as strikes, rallies, and demonstrations, demanding that the government withdraw its troops and withdraw from the war of aggression in Korea, and demanding the signing of a peace pact between the five major powers, and striving for peace, and are by no means the docile and powerless little cow that the author compares them to.

On the other hand, the author did not recognize the essence of the problem and was deceived by superficial phenomena. Bevan's resignation is merely a deceptive trick by the rulers of capitalist countries in the face of the high tide of the people's movement against aggressive war and demanding peace, and it is by no means that the Bevan clique is opposing the policies of the British government, so this painting is giving him deceptive publicity.

Another example is Comrade Zheng Shifeng's poem in the Cartoon Monthly, issue 11, which compares the voluntary withdrawal from Seoul by the Chinese and Korean people after killing and wounding more than 30,000 US aggressor troops to MacArthur "stealing a chicken and losing a picul of rice." This metaphor is already absurd. Judging from the illustrations drawn by Comrade Zhang Leping: MacArthur is carrying a large bag, filled with "30,000 officers and soldiers", and sprinkling a pile of skulls with his left hand like rice, about to "steal" a rooster likened to "Seoul." This painting cannot withstand careful analysis: first, it compares the blatant robbery of US imperialism to theft; second, it treats the US aggressor troops who suffered heavy casualties under the blows of the Chinese and Korean people as "rice" that MacArthur throws out at will; third, it compares Seoul, which belongs to the heroic and unyielding Korean people, to a weak and powerless rooster for slaughter; fourth, it turns our voluntary withdrawal from Seoul to create more favorable conditions for killing US aggressor troops into US imperialism voluntarily coming to "steal."

This work also uses a perfunctory way to make a metaphor for the heroic and tenacious struggle made by the Chinese and Korean people under all kinds of difficult conditions to defend their homeland and defend world peace, which not only vulgarizes this sacred self-defense action but also distorts the essence of the war.

Similarly, in the same issue, another painting by Comrade Lin Jianxiu, "Long Line and Deep Water Fishing for Big Fish," also has similar problems, especially using Seoul as a duck, as bait, which is also wrong.

In the creation of cartoons, we should try to absorb metaphors or idioms that are national and familiar to the people, because they can enrich the expressive methods of our cartoons and are easily accepted by the broad masses. However, the use of metaphors must be precise and critically selected, and the essential differences must not be ignored due to formal similarities. How to choose metaphors is inseparable from the author's political level.

　　漫画中的不恰当的比喻
     方成
    运用比喻，是漫画的主要表现方法之一，但选择正确适当的比喻需要经过作者的细心考虑，严肃认真地加以选择，特别要从事物的本质及其内在联系上去着眼，抓住比喻和所要表现的问题之间的共同点，以引起读者的联想力。否则就会歪曲与损害所表现的问题的本质。
    最近有些读者来信批评的几幅漫画，就是片面地，形式地乱用比喻，在宣传上起了相反的效果。
    例如展望七卷十七期封面上余白墅同志所作的一张漫画，画的是：杜鲁门坐在满载着军火走下山坡的车上，一条瘦弱不堪的牛拖着车子。牛身上写着“英国人民”。艾德礼和贝凡（比万）牵着牛走。贝凡把鞭子一丢，手按着额，向艾德礼悲观地说：“我不能为跟着美帝走向死路的使英国破产的扩军备战政策继续效力了。”
    这样的比喻是极不恰当的。把和我们站在一条阵线上争取和平反对侵略战争的战友——英国人民——比做战争贩子们所豢养的一条瘦小难看的牛，作者显然没有认清自己的立场，对英国人民没有战友的同情，对敌人没有任何憎恨；同时，作者也没看到今天的英国人民日益增长的力量。英国广大群众正在不断地用罢工、集会、示威游行等各样的方式要求政府不要追随美国的政策，要求政府撤兵，退出在朝鲜进行的侵略战争，要求进行五大国和平公约的签字，进行争取和平的斗争，绝不是像作者所比喻的，他们是一条驯顺而无力的小牛。
    另一方面，作者没有认清问题的本质，而被表面现象所迷惑了。贝凡的辞职，只是资本主义国家统治者在人民反对侵略战争要求和平的运动高潮之下所作的一种欺骗把戏，绝不是什么贝凡之流在反对英国政府的政策，因此这张画却给他做了掩饰性的宣传。
    又如在漫画月刊第十一期中，郑拾风同志的诗，把中朝人民在杀伤三万多美国侵略军之后，主动撤出汉城，比成麦克阿瑟“偷了一只鸡，蚀掉米一担”，这比喻已经不伦不类；再从张乐平同志所画的插图看来：麦克阿瑟带着个大口袋，里面装着“三万官兵”，左手像撒米一样地抛出一堆骷髅头，正在要“偷”一个比作“汉城”的大公鸡。这张画经不起仔细分析：第一，把美帝国主义明目张胆的强盗行为比作偷窃；第二，把在中朝人民痛击下而遭遇严重伤亡的美国侵略军当成了麦克阿瑟随意自动抛出的“米”；第三，把属于英勇不屈的朝鲜人民的汉城比作供人屠宰软弱无力的公鸡；第四，对于我们为创造更有利的杀伤美国侵略军的条件而自动撤离汉城，变成了美帝国主义自动来“偷取”。
    这幅作品又把中朝人民为了保卫自己的国土，保卫全世界和平，在百般艰苦的条件下所作的英勇顽强的斗争，用一种轻描淡写的方式来作比喻，不但把这一神圣的自卫行动庸俗化，而且歪曲了战争的本质。
    同样的，在同一期的另一张林剑修同志所作“长线深水钓大鱼”的画中，也有类似的毛病，特别是用汉城比作鸭子，当成钓饵，也是错误的。
    在漫画的创作上，应该尽量吸取民族的、人民所熟悉的比喻或成语，因为它可以丰富我们漫画的表现方法，也易于为广大群众所接受。但是，比喻的运用必须精密地，经过批判地加以择取，不能由于形式上的相类而忽略了本质上的差别。如何选用比喻，是与作者的政治水平分不开的。
