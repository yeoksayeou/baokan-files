My Understanding of Communists
    Feng Youlan, Professor at Tsinghua University

　　When Beijing had just been liberated, a cultural troupe came to perform at our school. In a large chorus, a young member standing in the front row, who looked to be only ten years old or so, had a face full of fervor, determination, and confidence as he sang. His small face left a deep impression on me. He was still young and certainly not a Communist Party member, but I always thought of him as one.

    Stalin said: Communists are made of special material. This certainly does not mean that Communists are born different from others, but rather that Communists, due to their class standing and the education and training they receive in struggle, are bound to have noble qualities. The fervor, determination, and confidence mentioned above are part of the noble qualities of Communists.

    In a society with classes, people of each class naturally have their different positions. For non-proletarians to stand on the proletarian position, they need to undergo a long period of transformation, because their position was originally not the proletarian position. Changing one's position is not as easy as changing one's clothes, nor is it like walking from one field to another on the playground.

    The proletariat naturally has the proletarian position. They are already standing on that position, but that is not enough. Such an original position is "spontaneous," but not necessarily "conscious"; it is "in itself," but not necessarily "for itself." A spontaneous position cannot exert its greatest power; it must go through organized struggle and theoretical study. Only those who consciously stand on that position can be firm and exert the greatest power. Communists all have such a conscious and firm position. Therefore, on the one hand, they are indeed different from people of other classes. They are the most advanced of the proletariat, they are the vanguard of the proletariat.

    When Beijing had just been liberated, the first people the general public came into contact with were the People's Liberation Army. What surprised the general public the most was that everyone in the People's Liberation Army could eloquently expound great principles. One day, I heard a soldier of the People's Liberation Army arguing with someone outside my window. This soldier said, "Do you know what the meaning of life is?" I was shocked when I heard this. "The meaning of life" is a topic that we philosophy professors often discuss in the classroom, but it has a different meaning when it comes out of the mouth of a soldier of the People's Liberation Army. What the People's Liberation Army is carrying out is a genuine and unambiguous life-and-death struggle. With such practical action in struggle, coupled with theoretical study, they also understand in theory why they live and why they die. An army organized by people with such a conscious and firm position is invincible in the world. Our Volunteer Army defeated the self-proclaimed world's strongest American imperialist army's so-called most elite troops in Korea, proving that such an army is invincible in the world.

    Communists have a theory that is combined with practice, and a practice that is combined with theory. This is a manifestation of the previous point. The theory of Communists is inseparable from their revolutionary struggle. They study theory in order to guide revolutionary practice, and revolutionary practice in turn enriches revolutionary theory. In books, people can also learn a little theory, and they can also give speeches and write articles based on what they have learned. But when we listen to these speeches and read these articles, we always have this feeling: "Resounding and grand, but empty." I admire the Communist Party's leaders at all levels. When they talk about any issue, they are "logical and clear." When you listen to them, you don't feel how "resounding and grand" at first, but you just feel that it is not empty at all. When you listen, you feel that there is a way to solve everything, and every method has a reason. They don't mention Marxism-Leninism, but Marxism-Leninism is everywhere. Later, you realize that this is the real "resounding and grand." Theory and practice are integrated into a whole, and in this whole, it is difficult to distinguish whether theory guides practice or practice enriches theory. This is the highest achievement of the combination of theory and practice.

    Communists have a strong belief in the victory of the revolution. This is again the result of the first and second points. Communists have a firm position, so they must be strong in the struggle. At the same time, their theoretical study enables them to grasp the laws of social development. From these laws, Communists know exactly what is developing and what is declining in the current society, what is nascent and what is dying. Communists themselves know that they are the vanguard of the developing forces, that is, the embodiment of the developing forces. Therefore, they believe that their cause is bound to be victorious. This is not a blind faith, but a belief based on science.

    Chairman Mao said, "We have difficulties, we have solutions, and we have hope." How can a revolutionary cause, especially a revolutionary cause led by the Communist Party that turns the world upside down, not have difficulties? But although there are difficulties, there are solutions, because the Communist Party has Marxist theory as a guide and grasps the laws of social development. According to these laws, there can be scientific methods to solve problems. The reactionary classes do not know, or dare not know, the laws of social development. Their actions are based on subjective wishes, rushing headlong. Therefore, Communists are optimistic in any difficult environment. In the experience of struggle, they deeply understand Stalin's famous saying: "Only that which is being produced and developing is invincible."

    Christians also have three words: "Faith, Hope, Love." But what they believe in is their own imagined God. What they hope for is their own imagined heaven. What they love is abstract humanity. What Communists believe in are the laws discovered by dialectical materialism and historical materialism. What they hope for is to create a paradise on earth through labor in accordance with these laws. What they love is the working people, and the working people are indeed the vast majority of all mankind. Because they love this vast majority, they cannot but overthrow the rule of the tiny minority that exploits the vast majority. As for these tiny minority, they only overthrow their class rule, and for them personally, they also transform them and ask them to become working people.

    Here we see that religion and science are fundamentally different. As mentioned above, we can see that the effect of religion is to anesthetize the people, making them content to endure the pain of reality, while the Marxist scientific theory enables the people to create their own real paradise. Some people say: Although Communists oppose religion, they themselves have a very religious spirit; this is a misuse of words, confusing thoughts, in an attempt to extend the life of religion. This should be refuted.

    In the past thirty years, the Communist Party has already led the Chinese people onto the correct revolutionary path. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese revolution succeeded. Our motherland has not only restored its historical glory and greatness, but also has an even more glorious and greater future waiting for us. These achievements are inseparable from the noble qualities of Communists.

### 我对于共产党员的认识

　　我对于共产党员的认识
    清华大学教授  冯友兰
    在北京刚解放的时候，有一个文工团到我们学校里演出。在一个大合唱里，站在最前列的一位小队员，看样子不过是十来岁，可是他唱的时候，脸上充满了热诚，坚决与信心的表情。他的小面孔给我的印象很深。他的年纪还小，当然不会是共产党员，但是我总想着他是个共产党员。
    斯大林说：共产党员是由特殊材料制成的。这当然不是说，共产党员生来就与众不同，而是说共产党员，由于他的阶级立场，及他在斗争中所得的教育与锻炼，必然有高贵的品质。上面所说的热诚，坚决与信心，就是共产党员的高贵的品质的一部分。
    在有阶级的社会里，各阶级的人，自然都有他们的不同的立场。非无产阶级要想站在无产阶级的立场，需要经过长期的改造，因为他的立场，本来不是无产阶级的立场。改变立场并不是像换身上穿的衣服那样容易，也并不是像在操场上真有两个场子，你可以随随便便就从那个场子，走到这个场子来“站”。
    无产阶级自然有无产阶级的立场，他本来就是站在那个立场，可是这还不够。这样本来的立场是“自发”的，但未必是“自觉”的，是“自在”的，但不必是“自为”的，自发的立场还不能发挥出最大的力量，必须经过有组织的斗争及理论的学习。自觉的站在那个立场上的人，才能是坚定的，才能发挥出最大的力量。共产党员都是这样具有自觉的坚定立场。所以他们一方面固然是与别的阶级的人，绝不相同，他们是无产阶级中最前进的，他们是无产阶级的先锋队。
    北京刚解放的时候，与一般人最初接触的是解放军。一般人所最感觉惊奇的是解放军里，每一个人都能滔滔不绝地讲一番大道理，有一天我听见我的窗户外面，有一个解放军与别人辩论。这个解放军说：“你知道什么是人生的意义？”我听见心里一惊。“人生的意义”是我们哲学教授常在教室讲的一个题目，可是在解放军口里出来，可就有不同的意义。解放军所进行的真正是毫不含糊的生死斗争。有这样的斗争的实际行动，再加以理论上的学习，使他也在理论上了解，他是为什么而生，为什么而死。有这样自觉的坚定立场的人组织成的军队，是无敌于天下的。我们志愿军，在朝鲜打败了自命为世界第一强国的美帝国主义的号称最精锐的部队，证明这样的军队是无敌于天下的。
    共产党员有与实践相结合的理论，及与理论相结合的实践。这一点就是前一点的表现。共产党员的理论是与他的革命斗争分不开的。他们学习理论为的是指导革命实践，革命实践又反过来丰富革命理论。在书本上，人们也可以学习一点理论，也可以本着所学的那一点，作讲演，写文章。可是我们听这些讲演，看这些文章，总有这样的一个感觉：就是：“轰轰烈烈空空洞洞”。我佩服共产党的各级领导人员。他们谈起来，不拘关于什么问题，都是“头头是道”，你听他们讲：起初也不觉得怎样“轰轰烈烈”，只觉得真不空洞。你听起来觉得事事都有个办法，而每一个办法，也都有个道理。他不提马克思列宁主义，可是到处都是马克思列宁主义，后来你才觉得这才是真正的“轰轰烈烈”。理论与实践，融化为一个整体，在这个整体中，分不清究竟是理论指导实践，或者是实践充实理论。这是理论与实践相结合的最高成就。
    共产党员对于革命胜利有坚强的信念。这一点又是第一点与第二点的结果。共产党员有坚定的立场，所以他们在斗争中必然是坚强的。同时他的理论学习，使他把握了社会发展的规律。从这些规律里共产党员确切知道在现在的社会，什么是要发展，什么是要没落，什么是方生的，什么是将死的。共产党员自己知道他们自己是正在发展的势力的先锋，也就是正在发展的势力的化身。因此他们相信，他们的事业必然是胜利的，这不是一个盲目的信仰，而是有以科学为根据的信念。
    毛主席说：“我们是有困难的，有办法的，有希望的”。革命的事业，尤其是像共产党所领导的这样翻天复地的革命事业，岂能没有困难？但是虽困难而有办法，因为共产党有马克思主义的理论为指南，把握了社会发展的规律。照着这些规律，就可以有科学的方法解决问题。反动阶级不知道，或不敢知道，社会发展的规律。他们的举动是凭主观的愿望，横闯直撞。因此共产党员，在任何艰苦的环境下，都是乐观主义的。在斗争的经验中，他们深切了解斯大林的名言：“只有正在产生正在发展的东西，才是不可战胜的”。
    基督教徒也有三个字：“信，望，爱”。可是他们所信的是什么，是自己所幻想的上帝。他们所望的是什么，是自己所幻想的天堂，他们所爱的是什么，是抽象的人类。共产党员所信的是辩证唯物论与历史唯物论所发现的规律。他们所望的是照着这些规律以劳动创造出地上的天堂。他们所爱的是劳动人民，劳动人民确切是全人类的绝大多数。因为他们爱这绝大多数，就不能不推翻剥削绝大多数的绝小少数的统治。而对于这些绝小少数，也只是推翻他们的阶级统治，对于他们个人，还是改造他们叫他们也成为劳动人民。
    这里我们看出宗教与科学，在根本上是不同的。照上面所说，我们可以看出来，宗教的效用是麻醉人民，使他安于忍受现实的痛苦，而马克思主义的科学理论，则使人民创造自己的现实的乐园。有人说：共产党员虽反对宗教，但是他们自己很有宗教的精神；这是乱用字句，淆乱思想，以企图为宗教延续生命的说法，这是应该驳斥的。
    共产党在过去三十年已经领导中国人民走上了正确的革命道路。在共产党的领导下，中国革命成功了。我们的祖国，不但恢复了历史上的光荣与伟大，而并且还有一个更光荣更伟大的将来，等待着我们。这些成就与共产党员的高贵品质是分不开的。
