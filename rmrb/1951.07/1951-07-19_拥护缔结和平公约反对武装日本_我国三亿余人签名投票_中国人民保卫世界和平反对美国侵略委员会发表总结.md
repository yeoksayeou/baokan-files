Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 18th: Summary of the Chinese People's Signature Campaign to Support the Conclusion of a Peace Pact and Voting Against the Arming of Japan.

    The Chinese people's signature campaign to support the conclusion of a peace pact and voting against the arming of Japan has victoriously concluded. From late April to mid-July, a total of 343,808,541 people across the country signed in support of China, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France concluding a peace pact, accounting for 72.4% of the total population. This included 29,247,425 people in the Northeast Region, 45,072,212 in the North China Region, 1,744,595 in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, 104,745,993 in the East China Region, 17,991,253 in the Northwest Region, 99,427,131 in the Central South Region, and 45,579,932 in the Southwest Region.

    During the same period, a total of 339,658,730 people across the country voted against the United States unilaterally concluding a peace treaty with Japan and rearming Japan, advocating for the signing of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan and promoting Japan's peace and democracy, accounting for 71.5% of the total population. This included 29,256,746 people in the Northeast Region, 45,059,845 in the North China Region, 1,744,595 in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, 104,745,993 in the East China Region, 17,991,253 in the Northwest Region, 98,300,4724 in the Central South Region, and 42,555,574 in the Southwest Region.

    In cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Baoding, Anyang, Taiyuan, Datong, Xuanhua, Gui Sui, Lüda, Fushun, Anshan, Benxi, Harbin, Jinzhou, Shanghai, Nanjing, Jinan, Qingdao, Wuxi, Hefei, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Nanchang, and Xi'an, as well as provinces and regions such as Heilongjiang, Shandong, Northern Anhui, Fujian, Shaanxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Eastern Sichuan, the number of signatures and votes exceeded 75% of the total population of each city and province. In cities such as Baoding, Anyang, Jinzhou, Benxi, and Xi'an, the number of signatures and votes even reached over 90% of the total population.

    The Chinese people's signature campaign in support of the conclusion of a peace pact and the vote against arming Japan began on April 20, 1951. Most regions concluded victoriously by April 30, with only a few regions continuing the signature and voting campaign from early May to mid-July.

    Those who signed in support of the five major powers concluding a peace pact and voted against the United States unilaterally concluding a peace treaty with Japan and rearming Japan included people from all regions, ethnic groups, social strata, different faiths, and different occupations, including workers, farmers, government personnel, commanders and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, industrialists and businessmen, youth, women, artists, writers, scientists, other urban residents, and religious figures. This demonstrates that the will of the Chinese people to defend world peace and oppose the United States' war and aggression policies is unified across the nation.

    The number of people participating in the signature campaign to support the conclusion of a peace pact and voting against the arming of Japan this time was approximately 120 million more than the number of people participating in the signature of the Stockholm Peace Appeal of the World Peace Congress from May to November 1950 (which totaled 223,739,545 signatures). This proves that the political awareness and enthusiasm of the entire Chinese people for defending national security and world peace has greatly increased in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement aimed at safeguarding national security and world peace since last October.

    In addition to the above, the Chinese people's signature campaign to support the conclusion of a peace pact and voting against the arming of Japan this time also had the following two characteristics:

    First, this signature and voting campaign was closely integrated with the movement to accuse the United States and past Japanese aggression against China, and with the movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country. According to the suggestions put forward in the "Circular on Responding to the Resolutions of the World Peace Council and Popularizing and Deepening the Movement to Resist America, Aid Korea Nationwide" issued by the Chinese People's Committee for Defending World Peace and Opposing American Aggression on March 14, people from all walks of life across the country generally held small-scale gatherings in late April (and in some regions from May to July) to discuss the work of resisting America, aiding Korea, opposing the arming of Japan, and defending world peace, and accused Japan and the United States of their crimes of aggression, as well as the crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the running dogs of the Japanese and American aggressors, in persecuting the people. At the same time, they held signatures in support of the conclusion of a peace pact and voting against the arming of Japan. The result of adopting this method of signing and voting not only enabled all the masses of people participating in the signatures and votes to clearly understand the political significance of the signatures and votes, but also closely linked the signature and voting movement with the specific situation of various regions and strata, promoted the practical work of resisting America, aiding Korea, opposing the arming of Japan, and defending world peace in various regions and sectors, thereby turning the will of the people across the country to defend world peace into a material force.

    Second, after holding signatures in support of a peace pact and votes against the US arming of Japan in late April, on May 1st, International Labor Day, all cities and the vast majority of villages in China held large-scale demonstrations and parades to resist America, aid Korea, oppose the arming of Japan, and defend world peace. On this day, more than 186,430,000 people across the country participated in demonstrations and parades, accounting for more than 39% of the total population. This included more than 20,076,000 people in the Northeast Region, more than 31,600,000 in the North China Region, more than 590,000 in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, more than 46,130,000 in the East China Region, more than 7,140,000 in the Northwest Region, more than 53,800,000 in the Central South Region, and more than 26,410,000 in the Southwest Region. The scale of this demonstration parade was unprecedented in Chinese history. This was a powerful demonstration by the great Chinese people against the imperialists and warmongers who are obstructing the conclusion of a peace pact between the five major powers and obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Japanese question, the Korean question, the Taiwan question, and other issues in the Far East.

    The Chinese people are now continuing to strengthen various tasks to resist America, aid Korea, and defend world peace, and are unswervingly fighting for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question, a just resolution of the Japanese question, the recovery of Taiwan, and the defense of peace in the Far East and world peace. We believe that with the firm will of China, with its 475 million people, to shoulder the responsibility for maintaining the cause of peace, and with the united efforts of the Chinese people and the world peace and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union and the peoples of other countries, the cause of world peace can be maintained and consolidated.

　　拥护缔结和平公约反对武装日本
　  我国三亿余人签名投票
　  中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会发表总结
    【新华社北京十八日电】中国人民拥护缔结和平公约签名及反对武装日本投票运动的总结。
    中国人民拥护缔结和平公约签名和反对武装日本投票运动已经胜利地结束了。从四月下旬开始，截至七月中旬为止，全国签名拥护中国、苏联、美国、英国、法国五大国缔结和平公约者，共达三亿四千三百八十万八千五百四十一人，占全国总人口百分之七十二点四。其中东北区二千九百二十四万七千四百二十五人，华北区四千五百零七万二千二百一十二人，内蒙古自治区一百七十四万四千五百九十五人，华东区一亿零四百七十四万五千九百九十三人，西北区一千七百九十九万一千二百五十三人，中南区九千九百四十二万七千一百三十一人，西南区四千五百五十七万九千九百三十二人。
    在同一期间，全国投票反对美国单独对日媾和、重新武装日本，主张签订全面的对日和约、促进日本的和平民主者，共达三亿三千九百六十五万八千七百三十人，占全国总人口百分之七十一点五。其中东北区二千九百二十五万六千七百四十六人，华北区四千五百零五万九千八百四十五人，内蒙古自治区一百七十四万四千五百九十五人，华东区一亿零四百七十四万五千九百九十三人，西北区一千七百九十九万一千二百五十三人，中南区九千八百三十万零四千七百二十四人，西南区四千二百五十五万五千五百七十四人。
    北京、天津、保定、安阳、太原、大同、宣化、归绥、旅大、抚顺、鞍山、本溪、哈尔滨、锦州、上海、南京、济南、青岛、无锡、合肥、武汉、广州、南昌、西安等城市，以及黑龙江、山东、皖北、福建、陕西、湖南、江西、川东等省区，签名及投票的人数都超过各该城市及省区总人口百分之七十五。保定、安阳、锦州、本溪、西安等城市签名投票者更达到总人口百分之九十以上。
    中国人民拥护缔结和平公约签名及反对武装日本投票运动是一九五一年四月二十日开始的，大部分地区在四月三十日即已胜利结束，只有一部分地区，签名、投票的运动在五月初至七月中旬的期间还在继续进行。
    签名拥护五大国缔结和平公约，投票反对美国单独对日媾和及重新武装日本的人，包括了全国各个地区、各个民族、各个阶层和不同信仰、不同职业的人民，其中有工人、农民、人民政府的工作人员、人民解放军的指战员、工商业者、青年、妇女、艺术家、文学家、科学家、城市其他居民及宗教界人士等。这表示着中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国的战争政策及侵略政策的意志是举国一致的。
    这次全国参加拥护缔结和平公约签名及反对武装日本投票的人数，较一九五○年五月至十一月参加世界和平大会斯德哥尔摩和平宣言签名的人数（那次签名者计为二亿二千三百七十三万九千五百四十五人）比较，增加了一亿二千万人左右。这证明了全中国人民，在自去年十月以来的以保卫祖国安全和保卫世界和平为目标的抗美援朝运动中，政治觉悟和保卫祖国安全、保卫世界和平的积极性，已经大大提高。
    除上述各点以外，中国人民这次拥护缔结和平公约签名及反对武装日本投票运动，还有以下两个特点：
    第一，这次签名投票运动，是与控诉美国及过去日本侵略中国罪行的运动，与抗美援朝保家卫国运动密切地结合在一起的。全国各地各界人民，根据中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会在三月十四日发出的《为响应世界和平理事会的决议并在全国普及深入抗美援朝运动的通告》中所提出的建议，在四月下旬（一部分地区是在五月到七月）普遍地举行了小型集会，讨论了抗美援朝、反对武装日本及保卫世界和平的工作，并控诉了日本和美国的侵略的罪行以及日美侵略者走狗蒋介石匪帮迫害人民的罪行，同时举行了拥护缔结和平公约的签名和反对武装日本的投票。采用这种方式来签名、投票的结果，不但使所有参加签名投票的人民群众都清楚地了解了签名、投票的政治意义，而且使签名、投票运动密切地连系了各个地区各个阶层的具体情况，推动了各地各界人民的抗美援朝、反对武装日本、保卫世界和平的实际工作，从而使全国人民保卫世界和平的意志变为物质的力量。
    第二，在四月下旬举行拥护和平公约的签名及反对美国武装日本的投票之后，在五月一日国际劳动节，全中国所有的城市和绝大多数乡村都举行了抗美援朝、反对武装日本、保卫世界和平的示威大游行。在这一天，全国各地参加示威游行的群众，共有一亿八千六百四十三万人以上，即占全国总人口百分之三十九以上。其中东北区在二千零七十六万人以上，华北区在三千一百六十万人以上，内蒙古自治区在五十九万人以上，华东区在四千六百一十三万人以上，西北区在七百一十四万人以上，中南区在五千三百八十万人以上，西南区在二千六百四十一万人以上。这次示威游行的规模之大，是中国历史上从来没有过的。这是伟大的中国人民对于阻挠五大国缔结和平公约和阻挠以和平方式解决日本问题、朝鲜问题、台湾问题及远东其他问题的帝国主义者和战争贩子的有力示威。
    中国人民现在正在继续加强抗美援朝保卫世界和平的各项工作，不屈不挠地为和平解决朝鲜问题，公正解决日本问题，收复台湾，保卫远东和平和世界和平而奋斗。我们相信，有着四亿七千五百万人民的中国表示担当维护和平事业责任的坚决意志，有着中国人民与以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营及其他各国人民团结一致的努力奋斗，世界和平事业是能够保持和巩固的。
