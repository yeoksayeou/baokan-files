How Shanxi Province Corrects the Tendency of "Focusing on Construction Without Asking About Politics"?
	He Wei

	During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the War of Liberation, and the Land Reform Movement, the people of Shanxi Province, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, demonstrated strong, courageous, and diligent spirits, making significant contributions. After the province's liberation, the broad masses of working people devoted themselves to restoring and developing production, achieving considerable success. However, new problems arose: some people gradually became less concerned with and attentive to domestic and international political events as they had been in the past, forming a tendency of "focusing on construction without asking about politics." This tendency was also reflected among some rural Communist Party members, with some developing passive and "declining" ideological sentiments of "revolutionary success." Their ideal "vision" was a pastoral life of "wife, children, warm bed, thirty mu of land, and an ox"; some even prepared to "hang up their satchels and sell their pens" to return home to production, thus losing their exemplary role as vanguard fighters of the proletariat in the people's revolutionary cause. Some leading organizations also only paid attention to the organization of various specific tasks and the implementation of various specific policies, failing to closely integrate economic construction with political struggle tasks, and neglecting the work of educating cadres and the masses ideologically. The enemy took advantage of this weakness to make trouble, resulting in a special agent attempting to subvert the people's regime in Jishan County through an armed riot; in Miaoqiao Village, Tunliu County, landlords counterattacked, killing the entire family of farmer Li Fuchang.

	Thanks to timely instructions from the CPC Central Committee and the North China Bureau, the CPC Shanxi Provincial Committee recognized this problem early on and further understood the importance of Chairman Mao's instruction that "the serious problem is educating the peasants." Therefore, in the great movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, patriotic ideological and political education was launched throughout the province from top to bottom and from inside to outside, reversing the serious situation of production and politics being divorced. The experiences are as follows:

	First, Comrade Lai Ruoyu, Secretary of the CPC Shanxi Provincial Committee, in his New Year's Day broadcast on Taiyuan Radio, severely criticized the extremely erroneous tendency of "focusing on construction without asking about politics." On February 16th, the Second Congress of the Communist Party of China in Shanxi Province emphasized the need to closely integrate economy and politics, and advocated that leading cadres learn to do political analysis, stipulating that Party committees at all levels should collectively study the political and ideological conditions inside and outside the Party at least once every two months to strengthen the Party's political and ideological leadership. On April 28th, Comrade Lai Ruoyu gave a political report to Party member cadres in provincial-level organs, further explaining the important significance of combining political struggle with current practical work. The leading organs' emphasis on political education, and the strict criticism within the Party of the erroneous tendencies of neglecting politics and neglecting propaganda, had a tremendous impact on Party members. Therefore, by April, when the anti-U.S. aggression and aid Korea movement and the vigorous suppression of counter-revolutionaries were being popularized and deepened throughout the province, political education had formed a movement.

	Second, the "summation" of political education work was carried out in various parts of the province through the people's own political experiences. The universal experience was to accuse the enemy of their crimes and recall the history of struggle. The accusation movement aroused the people's hatred for the enemy, overcame complacency, and established a sense of enemy situation. A farmer from Caojiayan, Pingding County, realized: "Special agents are the leaves, the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit gangs are the branches, and U.S. imperialism is the roots. Only by pulling them out by the roots will they not come back to harm the people." This unprecedentedly large-scale mass self-education throughout the province encouraged the people's fighting will. In Guocun, Yu County, when an illegal landlord ran away, a farmer rang the alarm, and sixty farmers chased and captured him in less than an hour. When carrying out the accusation movement, it is necessary to emphasize encouraging the masses' fighting will. The people of Qinyuan County suffered greatly from the "Three Alls Policy" of the Japanese invaders during the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, but when they accused the Japanese invaders of their crimes, they recalled the glorious history of the people's tenacious struggle against the Japanese invaders, who were finally driven away. This greatly inspired the masses' fighting spirit. The people of the whole county vowed: resolutely carry forward the tenacious spirit of fighting against Japanese imperialism in the past, and take practical actions to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, settling the old and new scores with U.S. imperialism.

	Third, the method of comparing two eras and two results was adopted in the movement to clarify its political significance. The people consciously understood the superiority of the new democratic social system, and they felt that the motherland was particularly lovable, and they actively rose up to defend the motherland. A farmer from Yushe County said: "With a lovable motherland, we have today's happy life! Resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea is to defend my houses and land, to defend the motherland." Qi Xuejing's father in Dongnie Village, Yuci, was a counter-revolutionary and was arrested by the government. After that, Qi Xuejing's brother attempted to retaliate and murder village cadres, and was immediately reported by Qi Xuejing. Qi Xuejing said: "They are not worthy of being my father and brother, they are running dogs of U.S. imperialism." This is the noble quality of loving the motherland after the people have awakened.

	Fourth, the Party has established an organized propaganda team that is closely connected with the masses. According to preliminary statistics: there are 3,500 reporters and nearly 30,000 propagandists in the province. They give political reports to the masses regularly and at any time and place, and carry out propaganda and mobilization. This has greatly increased the political atmosphere. The masses call the propagandists "keys to happiness." The Party Committee directly under the CPC Shanxi Provincial Committee organized nearly 700 reporters to give political reports to 100,000 people in Yangqu County and other places. This time the reporters went to the countryside, had a great impact, had good results, the masses welcomed them, the cadres were excited, the leading organs understood the ideological sentiments of the masses, and the political atmosphere in the organs was also thicker than in the past.

	Fifth, formulating patriotic pacts is the best way to infiltrate the spirit of patriotism into the daily lives of the people and lead the patriotic upsurge to deepen and last. In April, patriotic pacts were generally formulated throughout the province. This has consolidated the idea of combining the sacred political struggle tasks with the economic construction tasks. For example, the ore team of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant not only improved production efficiency in the formulation and implementation of patriotic pacts, but also performed well in current affairs study and donations of weapons.

	Through a series of political education, the work style in Shanxi Province has greatly changed, presenting a new atmosphere. An atmosphere has now been created so that every worker believes that their responsibility is not only to work diligently, but also to study politics and improve their awareness. They believe that not caring about politics is a shameful thing. The situation in which many masses were unwilling to attend meetings in the past has fundamentally changed. In the past three months, 4,000 reading groups have been developed throughout the province, and the number of newspaper subscriptions has increased significantly. A vigorous patriotic production competition movement, a donation of aircraft and artillery movement, and preferential treatment for families of martyrs and military personnel have been launched throughout the province.

	The CPC Shanxi Provincial Committee believes that all these achievements show that the Party's ideological work is the driving force for promoting all work forward. It cannot be satisfied with the achievements that have been made in ideological work, but must pay attention to it regularly and continue to improve the ideological awareness and political enthusiasm of the masses.

### 山西省怎样纠正“埋头建设不问政治”的偏向？

　　山西省怎样纠正“埋头建设不问政治”的偏向？
    何微
    在抗日战争、解放战争和土地改革运动中，山西省人民在中国共产党的领导下，表现了坚强勇敢和勤劳不倦的精神，有了很大的贡献。全省解放以后，广大劳动人民致力于恢复发展生产，也有相当成绩。但是，新的问题发生了，这就是一部分人逐渐对国内外政治事件没有像过去那样关心和重视，形成了“埋头建设不问政治”的偏向。这种偏向同时也在部分农村共产党员中反映出来，有些党员滋长着“革命成功”消极“退坡”的思想情绪。他们理想的“远景”，是“老婆孩子热炕头，三十亩地一头牛”的田园生活；有的甚至准备“放起挂包，卖掉水笔”回家生产，因而丧失了作为无产阶级先锋战士在人民革命事业中的模范作用。某些领导机关也只注意了各种具体工作的组织和各种具体政策的执行，没有把经济建设与政治斗争任务密切结合起来，忽视了从思想上教育干部、教育群众的工作。敌人就利用我们这个弱点进行捣乱，发生了特务在稷山企图颠覆人民政权的武装暴乱；屯留县苗翘村地主反攻，杀害了农民李福昌全家。
    由于中共中央与华北局的及时指示，中共山西省委较早地认识了这个问题，并进一步理解到毛主席所指示“严重的问题在于教育农民”的重要性。因此，在抗美援朝和镇压反革命的伟大运动中，自上而下、自内而外地在全省范围内展开了爱国主义的思想、政治教育，扭转了生产和政治脱节的严重情况。其经验有以下五点：
    一、中共山西省委书记赖若愚同志在太原广播电台广播的元旦广播词中，严厉批判了“埋头建设不问政治”的极端错误的倾向。二月十六日，中国共产党山西省第二次党代表会议强调提出了必须使经济与政治密切结合，并提倡领导干部学会做政治分析，确定各级党委每两个月至少要集体研究一次党内外的政治思想状况，以加强党的政治领导与思想领导。四月二十八日赖若愚同志向省级机关党员干部作政治报告时，又详细解释了政治斗争与当前各项实际工作相结合的重要意义。领导机关的重视政治教育，并在党内严格地批判忽视政治、忽视宣传的错误倾向，在党员中起了巨大的影响。所以到四月全省在普及深入抗美援朝和大张旗鼓镇压反革命运动时，政治教育就形成了一个运动。
    二、通过群众的切身政治体验，在全省各地进行了政治教育工作的“总结”。普遍的经验是控诉敌人罪行和回忆斗争历史。控诉运动激发了人民群众仇恨敌人的情绪，克服了麻痹思想，树立了敌情观念。平定县曹家岩农民认识到：“特务是树叶，蒋阎匪帮是树枝，美帝国主义是树根。只有连根拔掉它们，才不会再来祸害人民。”这一空前规模的全省的群众自我教育，鼓舞了人民群众的斗争意志。盂县郭村跑了一个不法地主，一个农民打钟报警，六十个农民追捕，不到一小时便抓回来了。开展控诉运动时，要强调鼓舞群众的斗争意志。沁源县人民在八年抗日战争中受尽日寇“三光政策”的摧残，但他们在控诉日寇的罪恶时，回忆了人民群众对日寇进行顽强斗争，终于将敌人赶走的光辉历史，这就大大鼓舞了群众的斗志。全县人民宣誓：坚决发挥过去与日本帝国主义斗争的顽强精神，以实际行动来抗美援朝，新仇旧恨要向美帝国主义算总账。
    三、在运动中采用两个时代、两种结果的对比方法，来阐明它的政治意义。人民自觉地懂得了新民主主义社会制度的优越性，他们就觉得祖国格外可爱，积极起来保卫祖国。榆社县农民说：“有了可爱的祖国，才有了今天美满的生活！抗美援朝就是保卫我的房屋土地，保卫祖国。”榆次东聂村齐学敬的父亲是反革命分子，被政府逮捕后，齐学敬的哥哥企图报复，谋杀村干部，立即为齐学敬检举出来。齐学敬讲：“他们不配做我的父亲和哥哥，他们是美帝国主义的走狗。”这就是人民觉悟以后热爱祖国的高贵品质。
    四、党已建立了一支有组织的与群众密切联系的宣传队伍。据初步统计：全省有报告员三千五百人，宣传员近三万人。他们定期和随时随地的向群众做政治报告，进行宣传鼓动。这样就使政治空气大大的浓厚起来。群众叫宣传员是“开心钥匙”。中共山西省委直属党委会曾组织了近七百个报告员，先后到阳曲县等地对十万群众做了政治报告。这次报告员下乡，影响很大，效果良好，群众欢迎，干部兴奋，领导机关了解了群众思想情绪，机关里的政治空气也比过去浓厚了。
    五、订立爱国公约，是把爱国主义精神渗入到人民日常生活中去，把爱国高潮引向深入持久的最好形式。四月份，在全省范围内较普遍地订立了爱国公约。这样就把神圣的政治斗争任务与经济建设任务相结合的思想巩固下来。例如，太原钢铁厂矿石小组在订立和执行爱国公约中，不仅生产效率提高，时事学习、捐献武器等方面都有很好的表现。
    经过一系列的政治教育，山西省的工作面貌大大改变，呈现了一片新气象。现在已经造成了一种气氛，使每一个劳动者认为他们的责任，并不止于勤恳地工作，而且要学习政治，提高自己的觉悟。他们认为不关心政治，那是可耻的事。过去许多群众不愿意开会的情况根本改变了。三个月来，全省读报组发展了四千个，报纸发行份数显著增加。全省各地轰轰烈烈开展了爱国生产竞赛运动、捐献飞机大炮运动和优待烈士家属、军属工作。
    中共山西省委认为所有这些成绩，都说明了党的思想工作是推动一切工作前进的动力，不能满足于目前思想工作已取得的成就，而要经常加以注意，继续不断地提高人民群众的思想觉悟和政治积极性。
