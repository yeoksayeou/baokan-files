　　Central Finance and Economics Committee's Directive on Continuing to Strengthen Pest Control Work

　　Since the beginning of summer, various insect pests have appeared one after another, among which locust nymphs, cotton aphids, and rice stem borers are the most common and serious, severely threatening this year's agricultural production. Since May, locust nymph outbreaks have occurred in nine provinces and regions, including northern Anhui, northern Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Hebei, Pingyuan, Shanxi, and Xinjiang, covering more than 150 counties and cities, with an area of approximately 2.8 million mu. After the local people's governments organized the masses to vigorously capture and eliminate them, and the People's Air Force assisted in spraying, the locust nymphs in some areas have been basically eliminated; in other areas, they have not been eliminated or not completely eliminated, and the pest situation is still developing; and in some areas, they have reappeared after being eliminated. Many remaining locust nymphs have now spread to the fields, harming crops, and some have already winged and taken flight, making capture even more difficult. Cotton aphids have gradually developed since early June, spreading throughout the cotton-growing areas of the country, with the affected cotton seedlings having curled and withered leaves. Red spiders have also begun to appear in some cotton fields, greatly affecting cotton production. Since April, rice stem borers have also been commonly found in rice-producing areas. Although many places have implemented stem borer control in rice paddies, such as Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, which have achieved great results, they have not been completely eliminated. Rice leaf rollers and armyworms have also begun to appear in Hunan, Shandong, Hebei and other provinces. Cotton leaf rollers (Yangtze River Basin), tobacco aphids and tobacco budworms are also occurring. At the same time, based on past experience, it is estimated that a large outbreak of autumn locusts this year will be inevitable. Therefore, the threat of insect pests is still very serious. In order to ensure a good harvest, the agricultural departments in various regions must build on the existing pest control efforts, redouble their efforts, strengthen leadership, rectify pest control agencies, fully prepare medicines and equipment, conduct in-depth publicity and education, mobilize and organize the broad masses, and continue to capture and eliminate pests in a timely manner. To this end, the following instructions are issued:
　　(1) In areas where locust nymphs have already occurred, it is necessary to vigorously organize the masses to continue capturing and eliminating them, striving to eliminate them quickly in the short term and resolutely prevent them from taking flight; if there are swarms of locusts taking flight, the fastest method should be used to notify the areas they are flying to, and the masses should be quickly organized to capture and eliminate them, preventing them from laying eggs, so as to avoid the occurrence of autumn nymphs. Areas where eggs have already been laid should vigorously carry out egg inspections and egg digging, and thoroughly eliminate them before hatching. Attention should also be paid to capturing and eliminating solitary locusts.
　　(2) Cotton aphids and red spiders reproduce extremely quickly and can easily spread into disasters, so they must be continuously and unremittingly controlled in order to achieve greater results. The agricultural departments of the people's governments in various regions should continue to prepare prevention and control agents (such as cotton oil soap, tobacco leaves, sulfur, lime, etc.), and lend the sprayers to the masses as soon as possible, so that all existing medicines and equipment can be fully utilized and their maximum effectiveness can be brought into play.
　　(3) Preliminary results have been achieved in the prevention and control of stem borers in many areas. In the future, the mass pest control movement should be carried out according to the specific conditions in various regions, grasping the laws of stem borer occurrence and development, and exemplary cases should be selected and commended and rewarded in a timely manner to improve and consolidate the masses' enthusiasm for pest control.
　　(4) Armyworms, rice leaf rollers, crickets, leafhoppers, cotton leaf rollers, tobacco aphids, tobacco budworms, etc. have already occurred or will soon occur. All localities must prepare in advance according to the season in which various pests occur, strictly inspect, and collect effective prevention and control methods from various localities, promote them, and promptly discover and lead the masses to capture and eliminate pests.
　　(5) The agricultural leading organs of the people's governments in various localities should improve the existing pest and disease prevention and control agencies and widely establish intelligence organizations. They should make use of slack farming seasons to convene district and village cadres and labor models for short-term technical training, so that all simple pest control techniques can be mastered by the broad masses.
　　Strengthen the publicity of the patriotic production movement, carry out education through various meetings, establish the masses' confidence in pest control, organize mobile pest exhibitions, show slides, and use real object comparisons and detailed accounting methods to explain the seriousness of pest damage and stimulate the masses' enthusiasm for pest control. At present, the prevention and control of insect pests must continue to implement the principle of artificial capture and elimination as the main method, supplemented by medicines and equipment, grasp the spirit of "fighting early, fighting small, and fighting thoroughly," and require that "where insect pests occur, they should be eliminated immediately," and resolutely prevent insect pests from spreading into disasters.

　　中央财政经济委员会关于
    继续加强害虫防治工作的指示
    入夏以来，各种虫害相继发生，其中尤以蝗蝻、棉蚜、稻螟为最普遍和最严重，严重地威胁着今年的农业生产。自五月份以来，发生蝗蝻的地区计有：皖北、苏北、山东、河南、湖北、河北、平原、山西、新疆等九个省区，一百五十余个县市，面积约达二百八十余万亩。经过各地人民政府组织群众大力捕灭和人民空军协助喷杀后，一部分地区的蝗蝻已经基本消灭；另一部分地区则没有消灭或没有彻底消灭，虫情仍在继续发展中；还有一部分地区是在扑灭之后，又重新产生。不少残余蝗蝻现已散移田间，吃害作物，有些已经羽化起飞，捕打更加困难。棉花蚜虫自六月上旬逐渐发展，遍及全国各植棉区，受害棉苗，叶子卷缩枯萎。红蜘蛛在部分棉田中亦开始发生，对于棉花生产影响极大。水稻产区自四月以来，稻螟蛾亦普遍发现，许多地方虽实行了秧田治螟，如浙江、福建等省获得很大成绩，但仍未根本消灭。稻苞虫和行军虫亦开始在湖南、山东、河北等省发现。棉花的卷叶虫（长江流域），烟叶的蚜虫和青虫亦在发生。同时，根据过去经验，估计今年大量发生秋蝗，亦将是不可避免的。因而，虫害的威胁，仍甚严重，为了保证丰收，各地区的农事机关必须在现有治虫基础上，再接再厉，加强领导，整顿治虫机构，充分准备药械，深入宣传教育，发动和组织广大群众，继续地及时地予以捕灭。为此，特作如下指示：
    （一）已经发生蝗蝻的地区，必须大力组织群众继续捕打，要争取短期内迅速消灭，坚决不使起飞；如有起飞蝗群，应采用最迅速的方法通知飞向地区，迅速组织群众力量予以捕灭，不使产卵，以免秋蝻发生。已经产卵地区应大力进行查卵、挖卵，在孵化前予以彻底消灭。并须注意捕灭散居型蝗虫。
    （二）棉蚜和红蜘蛛繁殖极快，容易蔓延成灾，必须继续不懈地进行除治，方能收到较大效果。各地区人民政府农事机关应继续准备防治药剂（如棉油皂、烟叶、硫磺、石灰等），并将喷雾器尽快地贷放到群众手里，务使现有药械，全部使用起来，并发挥它的最高效能。
    （三）防治螟虫，在许多地区已经获得初步成绩，今后应根据各地具体情况，掌握螟虫发生发展的规律，开展群众性的治虫运动，及时评选模范予以表扬和奖励，以提高和巩固群众治虫的情绪。
    （四）行军虫、稻苞虫、蟋蟀、浮尘子、棉花卷叶虫、烟蚜、烟青虫等都已发生或即将发生，各地必须按照各种害虫发生季节，预作准备，严加检查，并搜集各地行之有效的防治办法，加以推广，作到及时发现及时领导群众捕灭。
    （五）各地人民政府农业领导机关应健全已有的防治病虫机构，并广泛地建立情报组织。利用农隙召集区村干部和劳动模范等进行短期的技术训练，使一切简单的除虫技术为广大群众所掌握。
    加强爱国主义生产运动的宣传，通过各种会议进行教育，树立群众治虫的信心，组织流动的虫害展览会，放映幻灯，用实物对比和算细账的办法，说明虫害损失的严重性，激发群众治虫的情绪。目前防除虫害必须继续贯彻以人工捕打为主，药械为辅的方针，掌握“打早、打小、打了”的精神，要求作到“虫害发生在那里，立即消灭在那里”，坚决不使虫害蔓延成灾。
