First District of Cheng'an County, Hebei
　　Reversing Cadre Complacency
　　Cotton Sales Campaign Deepens
    The First District of Cheng'an County, Hebei, has reversed the complacent mood of district and village cadres who were satisfied with initial achievements, and the cotton sales and storage campaign has been comprehensively and deeply unfolded. From June 25th to July 5th, in ten days, cotton farmers sold and stored more than 420,000 jin (of seed cotton).

    After the district deployed the cotton sales and storage work to various villages on June 25th, the Communist Party members, Youth League members, and cadres in the villages were initially very active. Party members and League members in eleven villages, including Dongyaobao, Xiyaobao, and Baisiying, took the lead in reporting at the cotton sales and storage mobilization meetings, selling or storing more than 11,700 jin of seed cotton for the state. Cheng Desheng, the Party branch secretary of Heishui Village, and Zhang Yinzong, the village head, reported their more than 2,000 jin of stored cotton at the village-wide Party member and cadre meeting, which influenced all Party members and cadres to take the lead in bringing out their cotton to sell or store with the cooperative. After the meeting, all thirty-four Party members and more than twenty-eight administrative group leaders in the village divided the streets and areas to carry out patriotic cotton sales and storage propaganda and mobilization among the masses. The entire village sold and stored more than 16,000 jin of seed cotton in five days. After Xixi Village convened a meeting of Party members, cadres, and the masses, it established a cotton sales and storage committee. More than sixty Party members, cadres, and Youth League members in the village divided into four streets to mobilize the masses to sell and store cotton. Wen Shuqin, the secretary of the Youth League branch, stored her more than 200 jin of stored cotton with the state and then mobilized Meng Laocai, a production expert, to encourage his five brothers to sell and store 4,600 jin of cotton for the state. Propagandist Meng Xixian first stored his 500 jin of stored cotton with the state and then used his own experience of the benefits of storing cotton in the past to mobilize another three households to store 950 jin of cotton. After the propaganda and drive of Party members and cadres, the entire village sold and stored more than 42,000 jin of seed cotton in three days.

    However, these achievements caused a blindly optimistic and complacent mood among district and village cadres, and they relaxed their continued leadership over the cotton sales and storage work. In most villages, after Party members, cadres, or a few progressive masses brought out their cotton, they believed that "the cotton sales and storage task has been completed," and "the masses have taken out all their stored cotton, and even if there is a little left, it doesn't mean anything." After Heishui Village sold and stored more than 16,000 jin of cotton in five days, some cadres blindly estimated that "including the cotton sold by the masses to other villages, there are at least 50,000 to 60,000 jin, and this time the work will not fall behind!" So they wanted to "take a breath," and therefore no longer carried out in-depth patriotic cotton sales propaganda and education to the cotton farmers. In this way, the cotton sales and storage work only caused a temporary sensation among Party members and cadres and did not truly mobilize the broad masses, creating a mass patriotic cotton sales and storage campaign.

    In response to this situation, the district Party committee convened an enlarged meeting of village cadres on July 4th and, according to the instructions of the county Party committee, re-mobilized the cotton sales and storage work ideologically. It used the specific investigation materials of the masses' cotton storage to criticize the cadres' blindly optimistic mood of being satisfied with the status quo, the "only looking at oneself and not at others," or the "only looking for progressive masses and not for backward masses" easy-avoiding approach. At this meeting, it also specifically reported on the methods of launching model selection and model awards for cotton sales and storage, which improved the cadres' work enthusiasm and confidence.

    After this meeting, the cotton sales and storage campaign in the entire district comprehensively turned to in-depth development. After investigation, Heishui Village found that the cotton sold by the masses was only a small part, and even the 600 jin of cotton sold by the village head only accounted for half of the family's stored cotton. The cotton collection working group convened a meeting of Party members and cadres to conduct ideological mobilization, clarifying the significance of supporting the early start of the yarn factory for resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and the long-term interests of farmers, which improved everyone's patriotic enthusiasm. In a few days, it sold and stored more than 58,000 jin of cotton. In Beiyang, Xijie in Chengnenei, and Nanjie, where village cadres previously said that "the masses have no stored cotton at all," after in-depth mobilization of mass discussions and strengthening of patriotic propaganda and education, many masses reported stored cotton again. In one discussion meeting in Beiyang Village, seven cotton farmers reported an additional 360 jin of stored cotton. Another woman, after being mobilized by the village head, clarified the principle that selling and storing cotton is patriotism, and she took out 200 jin of seed cotton stored in someone else's house and stored it with the state. In the past, the cadres of Zhao Chong Village also believed that there was no more cotton in the village, but after convening small-scale mass meetings to recall the benefits of cotton planting, the masses remembered the destruction of cotton farmers by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang, which improved the masses' patriotic enthusiasm, and one group immediately reported an additional 400 jin of stored cotton. Wang Guihua, a propagandist in Houyuegu Village, led women to hold "review" discussion meetings to conduct patriotic education for women, and more than twenty women reported 610 jin of stored cotton on the spot. In Xinyi area, a total of ten villages, after in-depth ideological mobilization, the masses voluntarily sold and stored more than 6,800 jin of cotton in two days. After in-depth mobilization in Nanliuzhuang Village, Party members, cadres, and the masses took out 1,721 jin of stored cotton in one day. The cotton sales and storage campaign in the entire district is still developing in depth.

    Looking at the development process of the cotton sales and storage campaign in the district, there are several points that are particularly noteworthy. First, in order to make this work develop in depth, it is necessary to prevent and overcome the phenomenon of "slackening after a little achievement" among grassroots cadres. The way to overcome this, in addition to strengthening ideological education, is that leading cadres at higher levels must go down themselves and grasp certain investigation materials in order to convince cadres. Second, guiding farmers to recall the plundering and destruction of cotton farmers by the Kuomintang reactionary government and the Japanese invaders is an effective way to improve farmers' patriotic enthusiasm. Third, it is necessary to prevent and overcome the ideology and practice of avoiding difficulties among cadres, and it is necessary to mobilize not only the progressive masses but also the backward masses. Fourth, it is necessary to pay attention to mobilizing women at the same time. Because many farm families are women who control the cotton.

### 河北成安县第一区  扭转干部松懈情绪  售棉运动深入展开

　　河北成安县第一区
　  扭转干部松懈情绪
　  售棉运动深入展开
    河北成安县第一区扭转了区村干部满足于初步成绩的松懈情绪，售棉、储棉运动全面深入展开。从六月二十五日到七月五日十天内，棉农又售棉储棉四十二万余斤（籽棉）。
    该区自六月二十五日向各村布置售棉、储棉工作后，各村中共党员、青年团员、干部开始时都是很积极的。东姚堡、西姚堡、柏寺营等十一个村庄的党员、团员，在售棉、储棉动员大会上首先带头自报，卖给或存给国家一万一千七百多斤籽棉。河町村中共支部书记程德生、村长张荫宗，在全村党员干部大会上把自己二千多斤存棉自报以后，影响全体党员、干部都带头把棉花拿出来卖给或存到合作社。会后，全村三十四名党员、二十八个行政小组长以上干部，分街、分片向群众展开爱国售棉、储棉宣传动员，全村在五天中售储一万六千多斤籽棉。西魏村在召开了党员、干部、群众大会以后，成立了售棉储棉委员会，全村六十余名党员干部、青年团员，分四条街道动员群众售棉、储棉。青年团支部书记温书勤把自己存棉二百多斤存到国家以后，又通过生产能手孟老财动员他五个兄弟把四千六百多斤棉花卖、存给国家。宣传员孟喜贤先把自己五百斤存棉存到国家，又用他过去存棉亲身体验的好处，动员另外三户存棉九百五十斤。全村经过党员、干部宣传和带动，三天售储籽棉四万二千多斤。
    但是，这些成绩却使区、村干部产生了一种盲目乐观和自满的情绪，放松了对售棉储棉工作的继续领导。大部分村庄是党员、干部或少数进步群众把棉花拿出来以后，便认为“完成了售棉、储棉任务”，“群众存棉都拿出来了，即便剩一点，也没啥意思了”。河町村五天售棉储棉一万六千多斤，有的干部就盲目地估计说：“加上群众到外村卖棉，至少有五、六万斤，这回工作可没落了后！”于是就想“松一口气”，因而不再深入向棉农进行爱国售棉的宣传教育。这样，售棉、储棉工作只在党员、干部中轰动了一时，并没有真正把广大群众发动起来，造成群众性的爱国售棉储棉运动。
    根据这种情况，该区中共区委于七月四日分片召开了村干部扩大会议，根据县委指示，重新对售棉储棉工作作了思想动员。并用群众存棉的具体调查材料，批判了干部满足于现状的盲目乐观情绪，“只看自己、不看别人”、或“只找进步群众、不找落后群众”的避难就易作法。并在这个会议上具体报告了关于开展售棉储棉评选模范和奖励模范的办法，提高了干部工作的积极性和信心。
    经过这次会议，售棉储棉运动在全区全面转向深入。河町村经过调查，发现群众卖出的棉花只是一小部分，甚至村长卖出的六百多斤棉花，也只占家里存棉的一半。收棉工作组召开党员、干部会进行了思想动员，讲清了支援纱厂早日开工对于抗美援朝的意义和对农民的长远利益，提高了大家的爱国热情。几天中又售棉储棉五万八千多斤。北阳、城内衙西街、南街，以前村干部说“群众存棉一点也没有了”，经过深入发动群众座谈，加强爱国主义宣传教育，又有不少群众报出了存棉。北阳村一次座谈会中，即有七户棉农又报出存棉三百六十斤。另一妇女经过村长动员，弄清了售棉储棉就是爱国的道理，她把存在别人家的二百斤籽棉也拿出来存到国家。赵重村干部过去也认为村里没了棉花，但经过召开小型群众会进行种棉得利回忆，使群众想起了日寇国民党对棉农的摧残，提高了群众的爱国热情，一个小组当场就又报出存棉四百多斤。后岳固村宣传员王桂花领导妇女开“回顾”座谈会，对妇女进行了爱国教育，当场就有二十多个妇女报出存棉六百一十斤。新义片村共十个村庄，经过深入的思想动员，两天内群众又自动卖棉存棉六千八百多斤。南留庄村经过深入动员，一天中党员干部和群众又拿出存棉一千七百二十一斤。现在全区的售棉储棉运动仍在深入开展。
    从该区售棉储棉运动发展的过程看，有几点是特别值得注意的。第一，为了使这一工作深入开展，必须防止与克服基层干部中“稍有成绩，即行松懈”的现象。克服的办法，除加强思想教育外，必须上级领导干部自己下去，掌握一定的调查材料，才能说服干部。第二，引导农民回忆国民党反动政府和日寇对棉农的掠夺摧残，是提高农民爱国热情的有效方法。第三，必须防止与克服干部中避难就易的思想与作法，不仅要动员进步的群众，更要动员落后的群众。第四，必须注意同时发动妇女。因为有许多农家掌握棉花的是妇女。
