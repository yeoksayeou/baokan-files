Xinhua News Agency, July 7th dispatch from New York: Since the US Supreme Court announced on the 4th of last month that it would uphold the unconstitutional verdict of the Federal Court against the eleven leaders of the American Communist Party, the American people have continuously issued vehement protests against the actions of the American reactionaries in accelerating the nation's slide towards fascism.

The American Communist Party, the Progressive Party, the American Labor Party, the Civil Rights Congress, the American Slav Congress, many labor unions, and prominent social leaders have all spoken out to condemn the Supreme Court's decision and support the movement demanding a retrial. One hundred and eighty-seven labor leaders from across the country have jointly submitted a petition to the Supreme Court, requesting a rehearing of the case and a reconsideration of the verdict made under the Smith Act. Weisbord, secretary of the Labor Advisory Committee, which drafted the petition, said: Many leaders of the CIO, AFL, and independent unions support this petition, which shows that American workers are deeply concerned about the Supreme Court's obliteration of the constitutional provisions guaranteeing freedom of speech.

On June 26, a mass rally was held in Harlem, New York, to defend the Communist Party leaders. The rally was attended by 3,000 people, who unanimously expressed their determination to fight for the release of the Communist Party leaders, and to regard it as an indispensable part of the American people's struggle for peace and security.

Patterson, the secretary of the Civil Rights Congress and a progressive Black leader, called on the American people at the meeting to mobilize all forces to defend peace and oppose fascism. He pointed out that the purpose of persecuting communists is to eliminate the form of rule stipulated by the US Constitution and to pave the way for a third world war. Black singer Robeson sang "The American Song" for the heroic eleven American Communist leaders, winning enthusiastic applause from the masses. He said: The American people should engage in open struggle against the reactionaries. Prominent progressive writer Fast also spoke at the meeting, saying that American progressives should accomplish the task of defending the honor and security of the American people.

　　对于美政府迫害美共领袖的暴行
    美人民继续猛烈抗议
    斥责最高法院决定并要求复审
    【新华社七日讯】纽约消息：自美国最高法院于上月四日宣布维持联邦法院对美国共产党十一位领袖的违宪判决以后，美国人民对美国反动派加速把国家推向法西斯化的行动，不断发出了猛烈的抗议。
    美国共产党、进步党、美国劳工党、民权保障大会、美籍斯拉夫人大会、许多工会和著名社会领袖都发言斥责最高法院的决定，并支持要求重新审判的运动。来自全国各州的一百八十七名工会领袖已联名向最高法院提出申辩书，要求复审这一案件，并重新考虑根据史密斯法所作出的判决。拟定申辩书的劳工顾问委员会书记韦斯柏德说：许多产联、劳联和独立工会的领袖们都支持这个申辩书，这显示了美国工人对于最高法院抹杀宪法中保证言论自由的规定，深感忧虑。
    六月二十六日，纽约哈莱姆区举行了保卫共产党领袖的群众大会，到会者达三千人，他们一致表示决心为争取释放共产党领袖而斗争，并把它当作美国人民争取和平与安全的斗争中不可缺少的一部分。
    民权保障大会书记、进步黑人领袖派特逊，在会上号召美国人民动员一切力量来保卫和平反对法西斯化。他指出：迫害共产党人的目的是为了消灭美国宪法规定的统治形式，并为第三次世界大战开拓道路。黑人歌唱家罗伯逊为英勇的十一名美共领袖高歌“美国人之歌”，博得了群众热烈的喝采声。他说：美国人民应当与反动派进行公开的斗争。著名进步作家法斯特也在会上发言，他说：美国进步分子应当完成保卫美国人民的荣誉与安全的任务。
