　　Budget Delays Mainly Due to Poor Design; Cannot Be Used as Reason for Project Failure

To the Editor:

　　Regarding all the shortcomings that occur in our country's various basic construction projects, I believe the People's Daily has a responsibility to bring them up and correct them. Raising criticism is not to "completely negate" the achievements of various basic construction projects; it is mainly to make everyone realize that without correct design, basic construction will cause significant losses to national construction. It is absolutely not "scholars sitting in glass windows" finding fault with others. Comrade Chen Yougong mentioned "budget final accounts are extremely untimely – especially the budget issue, submitted but not approved for a long time…" But has Comrade Chen Yougong studied the reasons why "budgets are submitted but not approved for a long time"? As far as I know, the comrades who review the budget are generally quite responsible, and the situation of deliberately accumulating official documents is rare in the People's Government. The main reasons for late approval are:

　　First, the lack of complete engineering design and budget, repeated requests for information, and delays in approving the budget. This is the case in some areas of Beijing. Some units want to build houses, but only have a rough estimate, and some even lack the estimator's address and stamp. Drawing designs and construction instructions are not attached. Some people still think in their minds that "the Finance Bureau only manages appropriations and doesn't care about so many things." Some simply don't submit a budget and just keep asking for money. According to the decision of the Central Financial and Economic Commission, the financial departments can refuse appropriations without engineering construction design. Comrade Chen Yougong's statement shows that he has not yet realized this point.

　　Second, basic construction technical documents should be divided into: ① Basic design or planned tasks. ② Technical design. ③ Detailed engineering drawings. Whether it's the issue of cement sheds or the issue of transportation, if very detailed designs are made in advance, they can be resolved. For example, if a factory is being established, and there is already a good overall enterprise plan and various data for calculating the production outline, transportation data, calculations for steam power, fuel supply, sewers, ventilation, raw materials and material supply, calculations for cadres and their distribution and use, data and calculations on the planned enterprise's houses and buildings, and information explaining the organization of on-site engineering, then all problems will be impossible to occur after construction begins.

　　In addition to the above two points, I would like to mention another example of blindly starting construction and wasting the people's millet, which Comrade Chen Yougong is reluctant to hear. Some lessons can also be learned from this example.

　　In 1950, each fire brigade in Beijing added a ten-ton water truck. Before the water trucks arrived, they started constructing the garage and laying cement floors. Because they didn't know the height of the water trucks, the new garage of the Fourth Fire Brigade couldn't fit the large water truck; because they didn't know the weight of the water trucks, the cement floors of each brigade's garage all collapsed within half a year, affecting fire truck dispatch. Recently, re-laying the cement floors cost another 25,000 catties of millet.

　　Based on the above, I completely disagree with Comrade Chen Yougong's view that "errors in basic construction are mainly due to objective difficulties." I believe that whether the design is correct in subjective terms directly affects various basic construction projects. Please correct me if I am wrong.

### 预算迟批主要是因设计不精  不能以此作为工程失败理由

　　预算迟批主要是因设计不精
　  不能以此作为工程失败理由编辑同志：
    在我们祖国的各项基本建设中所发生的一切缺点，我认为人民日报有责任提出来纠正它。提出批评并非把各项基本建设的成就“一笔抹杀了”，主要是叫大家认清基本建设如没有正确的设计就会造成国家建设的很大的损失。绝不是“学者坐在玻璃窗内”找别人的岔子。陈有功同志提到“预算决算极不及时——特别是预算问题，报了上去，好久不批，………”但是陈有功同志是否研究了“预算报了上去好久不批”的原因呢？据我所知，审核预算的同志们一般是相当负责的，无缘无故地积压公文的情形，在人民政府中是很少的。批得迟的主要原因是：
    一，缺乏完备的工程设计和预算，往返索取，拖延了批准预算的时间。北京市有的情况就是这样。有的单位要盖房，只有一个草率的估价单，有的甚至还无估价人的住址和图章。图样设计和施工说明均不附送。有的人在思想上还以为“财政局只管拨款，管不了那么多事”。有的索性不送预算，只管一个劲要钱。按照中央财政经济委员会的决定，无工程施工设计，财政部门可以拒绝拨款。陈有功同志的说法是还没有体会到这一点的。
    二，基本建设的技术文件应该分为：①基本设计或计划任务。②技术设计。③工程详图。无论洋灰搭棚问题也罢，运输问题也罢，如果事先做了很周密的设计，是可以解决的。比如设立一个工厂，如果已经有了很好的企业总计划和关于生产大纲计算的各种资料，运输资料，关于汽力发动、燃料供给、下水道、通风、原料和材料供给的计算，关于干部的计算及其配布和使用，关于所计划企业的房屋和营造物的资料和计算，说明现场工程组织的资料等，在动工后一切的问题就都不可能发生。
    除了以上两点之外，我再提一点陈有功同志所不乐意听的关于盲目动工而浪费人民小米的事例。从这个事例里也可以得一些经验教训。
    北京市消防各中队，一九五○年各添十吨大水车一辆，水车未到即先行动工修建汽车房和打洋灰地。因为不知水车的高度，结果消防四中队新建的汽车房放不进去大水车；由于不知水车重量，结果各中队的车房洋灰地在不到半年内全部发生塌陷现象，影响了火警出车。最近重新打洋灰地又花了二万五千斤小米。
    根据以上所说，陈有功同志认为“基本建设中之发生错误，主要是由于客观的困难”，我完全不同意。我认为主观上设计的正确与否，直接在影响着各项基本建设。对否请指正。
