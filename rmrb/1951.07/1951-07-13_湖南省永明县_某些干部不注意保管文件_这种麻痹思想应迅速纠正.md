　　Yongming County, Hunan Province
　  Certain Cadres Neglect the Proper Storage of Documents
　  This Complacent Thinking Must Be Swiftly Corrected

Comrade Editor:
    The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government promulgated the "Provisional Regulations on Guarding State Secrets" on June 8th, which is very necessary. To date, many cadres are still very complacent and pay very little attention to guarding state secrets, which is very dangerous. Now I will tell you about two things that have recently happened in Yongming County, Hunan Province, to arouse everyone's vigilance.
    On June 5th, the Eighth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Yongming County piled a large number of Party documents and other documents together outdoors. It was not until June 8th, when the Yongming County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened an enlarged cadre meeting on land reform, that the cadres attending the meeting discovered it while eating there. The comrades of the County Committee then collected the Party documents. However, from June 5th to June 8th, many outsiders came to the courtyard to move things and do carpentry work, so it is not known whether any documents were lost. (Editor's note: The Yongming County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party should immediately conduct an inspection of this matter and give the personnel involved the punishment they deserve.)
    In addition, Comrade Zhou Zhimei of the Chengdong Township (a key township for land reform) work group in the Fifth District of Yongming County lived in a farmer's home. He actually threw 59 internal documents randomly on the table. People often came to the house for meetings or to hang out, but he didn't care at all. Later, Comrade Li Deyou of the Yongming County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party went to the township to inspect work and learned about this situation, and only then did he have him collect the documents.

　　湖南省永明县
　  某些干部不注意保管文件
　  这种麻痹思想应迅速纠正编辑同志：
    六月八日中央人民政府政务院公布了“保守国家机密暂行条例”，这是非常必要的。到目前为止，有许多干部思想还非常麻痹，对保守国家机密还极不注意，这是非常危险的。现在我把湖南省永明县最近发生的两件事告诉你们，以引起大家的警惕。
    中共永明县第八区区委员会在六月五日曾将大批党内文件和其他文件一同堆在屋外。直到六月八日，中共永明县委员会召开土地改革扩大干部会议时，参加会议的干部到那里吃饭才发现了，由县委会的同志把党内文件收了起来。而六月五日到八日之间曾有很多外人到院内搬东西和做木工，文件是否遗失还不知道。（编者按：中共永明县委员会应即对此进行检查，并给有关人员以应得的处分。）
    此外，永明县第五区城下乡（土地改革重点乡）工作组周芝美同志，住在一个农民家里。他竟将内部文件五十九件都乱丢在桌子上。屋内经常有人去开会或闲玩，他却毫不在意。后来中共永明县委员会李德有同志到该乡检查工作，了解到这个情况，才让他把文件收藏起来。
