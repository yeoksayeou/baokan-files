　　It is absolutely intolerable and must be exposed and eliminated that a few bad elements who seek personal gain through fraud have infiltrated our state organs. The Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate's exposing of the Chen Juhong and other cases of corruption and dereliction of duty is an important measure to uphold the law and discipline and protect state property. These bad elements used their positions to collude with private merchants in corruption and fraud, causing serious losses to state property. This is worthy of high alert. Other regions and other departments should take this as a lesson, rectify their own organs and leadership work, and strive to uphold the law and discipline, and defend state property and the purity of state organs.

　　The reason why bad elements are able to infiltrate government organs and carry out illegal activities is obviously because some of our government organs still maintain serious bureaucratic work styles. In carrying out basic construction, ordering materials, contracting for repairs, etc., they neither conduct thorough investigations and research in advance to understand the situation, nor do they have strict systems and regular supervision during the process, nor do they carefully inspect afterwards, so that unscrupulous merchants can deceive and defraud, cut corners, and the personnel involved often engage in fraud. If this situation is not brought to the serious attention of cadres in government organs at all levels, then the property and construction undertakings of our people's country will inevitably suffer serious damage.

　　Many of our cadres, after entering the city from the countryside, have encountered many unfamiliar things. However, some cadres in our business departments are unwilling to study diligently to improve their professional level; some pretend to understand when they don't, are blindly arrogant, do not follow the mass line, and do not learn from the masses, so that unscrupulous merchants can take advantage of loopholes, be deceived and deceived, and they themselves are still unaware. Shouldn't this arouse our high vigilance?

　　What is particularly alarming is that some responsible cadres are lenient and tolerant towards corrupt elements, and blindly protect law-breaking technical personnel; they even believe that punishing illegal industrialists and businessmen will hinder private capital. Therefore, they mostly handle corruption and fraud lightly, and rarely handle them seriously. Even some leading cadres lack a serious legal perspective of the people, and often handle corruption and fraud incidents themselves within their own units, and rarely transfer such cases to judicial organs for handling according to law. This makes bad elements think there are gaps to exploit, so that incidents of corruption and theft of state property occur from time to time.

　　In order to eliminate illegal phenomena such as corruption and fraud among government personnel and purify state organs, we must first resolutely oppose bureaucratic work styles, resolutely rely on the people, attach importance to investigation and research, strive to learn and master our own business, carry forward the fine tradition of hard work and simplicity, seriously treat law-breaking and discipline-violating elements, and eradicate illegal phenomena such as corruption and fraud left over from the old society.

　　Secondly, industrialists and businessmen across the country must consciously and strictly abide by the laws and decrees of the people's governments at all levels under the policy of benefiting both public and private interests, cherish the property of the motherland, and eliminate the bad habits of the old society of benefiting oneself at the expense of others in the name of public service. A few unscrupulous merchants are still speculating and taking advantage of opportunities, deceiving and stealing in the open and in the dark, and harming state property. The people must never tolerate such illegal behavior, and the people's government must severely punish them. What the people's government protects are legitimate and law-abiding industrialists and businessmen, and definitely not those few degenerates who harm the country and the people; legitimate industrialists and businessmen should consciously assist the government in exposing these black sheep in order to maintain the reputation of the business community and enable legitimate industry and commerce to develop further.

　　Finally, we hope that governments at all levels, people's organizations, and the people of the whole country will unite, uphold the law and discipline, protect state property, and always pay attention to resolutely fighting against unscrupulous elements who engage in corruption and fraud. Education on cherishing state property should be strengthened among the people, so that every Chinese person realizes that cherishing the property of the motherland is a moral that the people should consciously abide by; and corruption and fraud are extremely shameful anti-people and counter-revolutionary behaviors. Therefore, everyone should actively assist judicial organs in exposing corrupt and law-breaking elements. The people's procuratorial and judicial organs have shown remarkable achievements in investigating and trying corruption cases in the past, but they have not yet carried out this struggle more actively and in a more planned way, and there are still phenomena of being too lenient in sentencing standards. Lenin once pointed out on the issue of handling corruption and illegal cases: "It is a shameful behavior for communists and revolutionaries to give such playful, weak and light sentences instead of shooting those who take bribes." We should learn from Lenin's stern attitude towards illegal elements who steal state property. Only by thoroughly eliminating corruption and fraud can we ensure that all construction work of the country proceeds smoothly and ensure that the wealth of the people is not lost.

### 严肃法纪，为保卫国家财产和国家机关的纯洁而斗争！

　　严肃法纪，为保卫国家财产和国家机关的纯洁而斗争！
    在我们的国家机关中，有少数营私舞弊的坏分子混进来，这是决不能容忍的，是必须加以揭发与清除的。北京市人民检察署检举了陈居洪等贪污渎职案，这是严肃法纪，保卫国家财产的重要措施。这些坏分子利用职权勾结私商贪污舞弊使国家财产遭受严重损失。这是值得高度警惕的。其他地区、其他部门都应该以此为教训，整顿自己的机关和领导工作，为严肃法纪，保卫国家财产和国家机关的纯洁而斗争。
    坏分子之所以能够混入政府机关，并进行非法活动，显然是由于我们的某些政府机关，还保持着严重的官僚主义作风。他们在进行基本建设，订购物资，包修工程等工作中，事前既不进行缜密的调查研究，了解情况；在进行过程中又无严格的制度和经常的监督，事后又不仔细检查，以致奸商得以欺蒙诈骗，偷工减料，经手人员亦往往从中舞弊。这种情况，如果不提起各级政府机关的干部加以严肃的注视，那末，我们人民国家的财产和建设事业，必将蒙受严重的损害。
    我们有许多干部，由农村进入城市以后，遇到了许多生疏的事情。但是，我们业务部门的某些干部却不肯虚心钻研，以提高业务水平，有的反而不懂装懂，盲目自大，不走群众路线，不向群众学习，以致被奸商钻了空子，受了蒙蔽和欺骗，自己还一无所知。这难道还不应该引起我们的高度警惕吗？
    尤其值得警惕的，是有一些负责干部，对于贪污分子姑息放纵，对于犯法的技术人员也盲目地加以庇护；甚至以为对于违法的工商业者的处分也会妨害私人资本。因此，他们对于贪污舞弊分子从轻处理者居多，认真严办者极少。甚至某些领导干部缺乏严肃的人民法律观点，往往由本单位自行处理贪污舞弊事件，很少把这类案件移送司法机关依法处理。这样就使得坏分子认为有隙可乘，以致贪污与盗窃国家财产的事件时有发生。
    为了肃清政府人员中贪污舞弊等不法现象，纯洁国家机关，我们首先必须坚决反对官僚主义作风，坚决依靠人民群众，重视调查研究，努力学习并精通自己的业务，发挥艰苦朴素的优良传统，严肃对待违法乱纪的分子，根绝旧社会遗留下来的贪污舞弊等不法现象。
    其次，全国工商业者必须在公私两利政策之下，自觉地严格遵守各级人民政府的法令，爱护祖国财产，消灭旧社会假公济私损人利己的恶劣作风。少数奸商，现在依然投机取巧，明骗暗窃，损害国家财产。对于这种非法行为，人民绝不能予以宽容，人民政府必须加以严办。人民政府所保护的是正当的奉公守法的工商业者，而绝不是那些害国殃民的少数败类；正当工商业者应自觉地协助政府，检举这些害群之马，以维护工商界的信誉，使正当的工商业能得到进一步的发展。
    最后，我们希望各级政府、各人民团体以及全国人民，要一致起来，严肃法纪，保护国家财产，经常注意与贪污舞弊的不法分子作坚决斗争。在人民群众中应加强爱护国家财产的教育，使每一个中国人民都认识到爱护祖国财产是人民应该自觉遵守的道德；而贪污舞弊则是极端可耻的反人民反革命的行为。因此，人人都应该积极协助司法机关，检举贪污枉法之徒。人民的检察机关和审判机关过去检举与审判贪污案件，已经表现了显著的成绩，但还没有更主动地更有计划地进行这一斗争，在量刑标准上也还有失之过轻的现象。列宁对于处理贪污不法案件问题上曾经指出过：“不把受贿者枪毙，而给了这样开玩笑似的软弱而轻微的判决，这对于共产党人及革命者乃是可耻的行为。”列宁对待盗窃国家财产的不法分子的这种严正态度，我们应该学习。只有彻底肃清了贪污舞弊现象，我们才能保证国家的一切建设工作顺利地进行，才能保证人民的财富不受损失。
