　　The cotton sales campaign in Liangzhang Village has further strengthened Party-masses relations
    Liangzhang Village is a small village of sixty-two households. It was originally estimated that the village had more than 1,500 jin of stored cotton. However, after patriotic education and in-depth mobilization of the masses, everyone understood the significance of the state's purchase of cotton and became clear about the basic cotton purchasing policies. As a result, twelve households alone sold 2,530 jin of cotton. The campaign is still being carried out in depth.
  The CCP Branch organized forces to carry out in-depth publicity
    After the cotton purchasing instructions were conveyed to the village, the CCP branch held a meeting to ensure that every Party member understood the importance of cotton purchasing. The meeting also discussed: how to publicize the important meaning of selling patriotic cotton so that every household knows it; how to ensure that every cotton farmer sells their stored cotton to the state, except for what they must use themselves. After a heated discussion, the problems were specifically resolved, which greatly increased the Party members' confidence in completing cotton purchasing. Then, a meeting of cadres and masses from various systems was held, mobilizing all village cadres, Communist Youth League members, propagandists, and activists, more than forty people in total, to specifically assign the tasks of in-depth publicity and mobilization, implement a responsibility system, and propose: patiently mobilize, strictly prevent putting on big hats, and ensure that all cotton farmers, men and women, old and young, know that everyone is responsible for patriotic cotton sales. When the CCP Pingyuan Provincial Committee inspection team arrived in the village, they saw children aged seven or eight and old women in their sixties voluntarily doing propaganda on the streets. The masses in the whole village encouraged each other. The masses realized that selling cotton to the state is a glorious patriotic act.
  Party members and activists take the lead
    At the cadre meetings and mass meetings, more than twenty households of Party members and activists with stored cotton first declared their stocks on the spot, which greatly inspired the masses, who said, "We know how much property the cadres have. They are truly patriotic, and we can't lag behind!" Then many people voluntarily declared their stocks. The branch then absorbed the activists who emerged in the cotton sales, further studied the cotton storage situation in the village, and found that some households with more stored cotton still had ideological concerns, so they specifically assigned tasks to mobilize the major cotton storage households separately. For example, when the CCP branch secretary mobilized cotton farmer Ma Lizhu, he was rebuffed twice, but he continued to study and discovered his main ideological concerns. After five times of patient mobilization, guiding him to recall the destruction and oppression he suffered in the past during the enemy and puppet regime period, pointing out that American imperialism is now invading, and explaining that the People's Government has protected the interests of cotton farmers over the years, making him realize that selling cotton to the state can also realize his own production plan, he happily sold all his stored 700 jin of seed cotton and 50 jin of lint cotton to the state, and took the initiative to help cadres actively mobilize cotton purchasing. Now, not only have twelve households in the village sold more than 2,530 jin of cotton, but they have also effectively expanded the active elements in cotton purchasing, laying the foundation for in-depth mobilization.
  Conscientiously explain the policies and pay attention to uniting the middle peasants
    The village correctly implemented the policy of uniting the middle peasants in cotton purchasing. The CCP branch first reviewed the shortcomings of insufficient mobilization of the middle peasants in various movements in the past, such as land reform and suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and proposed: "Ensure that this lesson is truly made up through cotton purchasing." Therefore, in mobilization, they always paid attention to resolving the ideological concerns of the middle peasants, inspiring the middle peasants to compare the old and new societies from their own experiences, explaining the cotton purchasing policies to the middle peasants, which not only overcame the fear of many middle peasants that selling cotton would be a loss, but also further improved their political awareness and strengthened the relationship between the Party and the masses. Many middle peasants voluntarily reviewed: "In the past, we thought that Party members and cadres were just looking for trouble, but now we know that they are really working for the country and the people." At the same time, it was found that some middle peasants, affected by the past bad behavior of individual village cadres who indiscriminately borrowed things from the middle peasants, were afraid that they would not be able to keep their property if they sold cotton. After criticizing this wrong behavior, many middle peasants got rid of this "worry." Secondly, some households with more stored cotton were afraid that if they sold too much cotton, they would have to donate more. Therefore, the village also seriously explained the significance of donations in propaganda, emphasizing that only by drawing a part of the increased production to donate aircraft and cannons is the correct and active patriotic action. After doing so, the middle peasants not only boldly sold cotton, but also actively joined the patriotic production increase campaign.

### 梁张村在售棉运动中更加密切了党群关系

　　梁张村在售棉运动中更加密切了党群关系
    梁张村是一个六十二户的小村，原估计该村存棉一千五百余斤；但经爱国主义教育，深入发动群众，使人人知道国家购棉的意义，摸清购棉政策的底子之后，仅十二户即售出棉花二千五百三十斤。现在运动还在深入开展。
  中共支部组织力量深入宣传
    购棉指示传达到村以后，中共支部就召开会议，让每个党员都了解购棉的重要性。会上还讨论了：如何宣传卖爱国棉花的重要意义，确实做到家喻户晓；如何让每户棉农，除自己必用之外，将所存棉花卖给国家。经过热烈讨论后，问题得到具体解决，大大提高了党员完成购棉的信心。接着又召开各系统干部与群众会议，发动起所有的村干部、青年团员、宣传员和积极分子等四十余人，具体分配了深入宣传发动的任务，实行责任制，提出：耐心动员，严防扣大帽子，保证让种棉户男女老少都知道爱国售棉人人有责。当中共平原省委检查组到该村时，见七、八岁的儿童，六十多岁的老太婆都在街头自动宣传。全村群众互相鼓动。群众认识到把棉花卖给国家是光荣的爱国行为。
  党员、积极分子起带头作用
    在干部会议与群众会议上，所有存棉的党员与积极分子共二十余户，首先当场自报，对群众启发很大，都说：“干部的家当有多大，咱知道。人家真是爱国哩，咱也不能落了后！”接着有不少群众自报。支部随又吸收卖棉中涌现的积极分子，进一步研究本村存棉情况，发现有些存棉较多户，仍有思想顾虑，所以又具体分工，分别动员主要存棉户。如中共支部书记动员棉农马立柱时，碰了两次钉子，仍然继续研究，发现了他的主要思想顾虑。经过五次耐心动员，引导他回忆过去敌伪时所受的摧残与压迫，指明目前美帝国主义又在侵略，说明人民政府历年来保护棉农利益，使他认识把棉花卖给国家也能实现自己的生产计划后，他就愉快地把所存七百斤籽棉、五十斤皮棉全部卖给国家，并主动帮助干部积极动员购棉。现全村不仅有十二户出售了二千五百三十多斤棉花，并且有效地扩大了购棉中的积极层，打下深入发动的基础。
  切实讲清政策注意团结中农
    该村在购棉中正确地贯彻了团结中农的政策。中共支部首先检讨了过去在土地改革、镇压反革命等各个运动中对中农发动不够的缺点，提出：“保证通过购棉，确实补这一课。”所以在动员中随时注意了解决中农的思想顾虑，启发中农从切身经验中进行新旧社会的对比，对中农讲解购棉政策，不仅克服了许多中农怕卖棉吃亏的思想，而且进一步提高了他们的政治觉悟，密切了党和群众的关系。不少中农自动检讨：“过去认为党员、干部尽找麻烦，现在才知人家真是为国家为人民办事。”同时，发现有些中农，因受了过去个别作风不好的村干部向中农乱借东西的影响，怕卖了花保不住。经过对这种错误行为的批评，许多中农去掉了这块“心病”。其次，有些存棉较多的户，怕卖棉多了，要多捐献。因此，该村在宣传中又认真讲解了捐献意义，强调只有从努力增产中抽出一部捐献飞机大炮，才是正确的积极的爱国行动。这样做了之后，中农不仅大胆售棉，而且纷纷卷入爱国丰产运动。
