How Xinxiang and Anyang Counties Conducted Preliminary Ideological Mobilization in Cotton Purchase and Storage Work?

　　The people's representatives' conferences and district and village cadre meetings held in Xinxiang and Anyang counties around June 25th reflected some erroneous views and ideological concerns of district and village cadres and cotton-storing households regarding cotton selling and storage, and provided some preliminary experiences in resolving these ideological problems.

　　Before the meetings, some district and village cadres did not pay enough attention to the cotton purchase work. They had many incorrect views, believing that "whether or not to sell cotton is a matter for the yarn and cloth company" and that "the masses will naturally sell when they are in urgent need of money." Ma Shuangxi, a cadre of Xijiang Village in Anyang, had sold cotton to private merchants before the meeting. His thinking at the time was: "I will sell to whoever gives me more money." Therefore, it is very important to make reports, explain the reasons for the shutdown of yarn mills and its impact on the people of the whole country and the farmers themselves, explain the government's various assistance to cotton farmers, and criticize various incorrect ideas. Only in this way can the thoughts of cadres and representatives be focused on the issue of how to complete the task of selling and storing cotton.

　　After the report, there were roughly two kinds of ideological situations: district and village cadres and newly liberated household representatives had high awareness and little cotton in storage, and they reported all their cotton and sold it to the state; however, they felt it was difficult to mobilize the masses to sell cotton, feeling that "propaganda has no cost" and "it is not easy to mobilize." Some people advocated using coercive methods. The Communist Party branch secretary of a village in Anyang County said: "Go back and have a meeting, don't say anything else, if they don't sell cotton, ask them what they are thinking." A cadre from Donghuishangying Village said: "Go back to the village and announce a household registration check, secretly register the cotton in storage, and ask them to report it themselves, and if they don't, ask them to explain why." Many representatives from Xinxiang County advocated: "Go back and use the resistance against U.S. aggression and aid Korea to pressure them, asking if they are Chinese."

　　The representatives of cotton-storing households were silent. In principle, cotton should be sold to the state, but they also had some ideological concerns: fearing that cotton prices would continue to rise and wheat prices would fall, and that selling cotton to buy wheat would result in losses in the future. "If so much cotton is sold or stored at once, how much will be taken for donations?" "Afraid that other cotton-storing households will not agree and scold themselves; afraid that households who have borrowed cotton from themselves in the past will see that they are selling cotton this time and say that they are stingy."

　　Solving these ideological problems, holding good meetings, and raising the awareness of cadres and representatives is an important link in carrying out the cotton selling and storage campaign.

　　First, repeatedly explain the reasons for selling flowers to love the country. Use the farmers' personal experience to compare past times and raise the farmers' political awareness. For example, some village cadres and people's representatives said during discussions: "This is fighting against U.S. imperialism. They want to block us, they want to shut down our factories; if we farmers hoard cotton and wait for high prices, aren't we also blocking our own people's country? We must sell it to the state and give U.S. imperialism a head-on blow!" After recalling the past and comparing it with the present, they said: "Japanese devils and Chiang Kai-shek's troops also grew a lot of cotton. There was a time when a catty of eggplant was worth a catty of cotton, and a hundred catties of cotton could not be sold for three or four yuan; only with the people's government is the price of cotton insured." "Cotton cannot be eaten, so it must be sold; if the factory stops working and we can't buy what we want, it will also be detrimental to us farmers." After such discussions, the awareness of village cadres and people's representatives was raised, and they also felt that they had the capital to mobilize the masses when they went back.

　　Second, review the bad consequences of coercive orders in past work and establish a mass line style of work. Many village cadres and representatives said: "In the past, whether it was enlisting soldiers or collecting public grain, all work that involved mobilizing the masses from an ideological perspective and raising the awareness of the masses was completed smoothly; coercive methods always resulted in dissatisfaction on all sides. If we also use coercive methods to buy flowers this time, it will be difficult to complete the task, and it will make the masses dissatisfied, leaving worries for the future increase in cotton production." Because village cadres and people's representatives understood the reasons for selling flowers to love the country, and they also recognized the disadvantages of coercive orders, they were able to automatically come up with many ways to follow the mass line.

　　Third, conduct persuasion targeting the specific ideological concerns of cotton farmers. Those with more cotton in storage are mostly relatively wealthy middle peasants. This is a major issue related to the middle peasant policy. If it is done well, the purchase of cotton will be guaranteed; if it is not done well, it will not only affect the completion of the task, but also dampen the masses' enthusiasm for planting cotton and affect unity with the middle peasants. At the Xinxiang County People's Representatives Conference, the Director of the Commercial Department of the Provincial People's Government specifically explained the government's policy in response to the concerns of cotton farmers: (1) Wheat prices will not fall, because the government takes care of cotton farmers and also takes care of farmers who grow wheat. Cotton prices will not rise again; if they rise again, the yarn mills will not be able to weave cloth. The government must take care of farmers and also take care of factories. (2) Donating airplanes and cannons is about increasing production and donating; we advocate selling flowers to invest in production and donating a portion from the increased production. Moreover, donations must be completely voluntary and never forced. (3) Selling flowers is patriotic and glorious. If other cotton-storing households do not agree, we can use reason to open up their minds. If their ideological awareness is raised, they will automatically sell or store their cotton to the state, and they will never scold those who sell cotton first. Those who store a lot of cotton but are unwilling to sell it will be looked down upon by everyone. Those who have borrowed cotton from themselves in the past but were not given it will also understand because this time the cotton is being sold to the state. The effect was very good after the report.

　　新乡安阳两县在购棉储棉工作中怎样进行初步的思想动员？
    新乡、安阳两县六月二十五日左右召开的各界人民代表会议、区村干部会议上，反映出了区村干部、存棉户对售棉储棉的一些错误观点和思想顾虑，并提供了一些初步解决这些思想问题的经验。
    在会前，有些区村干部对购棉工作是不重视的。他们存在着许多错误观点，认为“棉花卖不卖是花纱布公司的事”，“群众急着用钱自然就卖了”。安阳西蒋村干部马双喜，会前曾把棉花卖给了私商。他当时的想法是：“谁给我钱多就卖给谁。”因此，做好报告，说明纱厂停工原因及对全国人民和农民自己的影响，说明人民政府对棉农的各种帮助，批判各种不正确的思想，是十分重要的。这样才能把干部和代表的思想集中到如何完成售棉储棉任务的议题上来。
    报告以后，大致有两种思想情况：区村干部、新翻身户代表觉悟高，存棉少，纷纷将存棉全部报出，卖给国家；但对如何发动群众卖棉，则感到困难，觉得“宣传没本钱”，“不好发动”。一部分人主张用强迫命令的方法。安阳县一个村的中共支部书记说：“回去开个会，啥也别说，不卖棉花就问他是啥思想。”东灰上营村干部说：“回村就说清查户口，暗暗登记存棉，叫他自报，不报让他说道理。”新乡县许多代表主张：“回去以抗美援朝压他，问他是不是中国人。”
    存棉户代表则表现沉默，按道理棉花应卖给国家，但又有一些思想顾虑：怕棉价还涨，麦价还要跌，卖棉买麦，将来吃亏。“一下子卖或存了这多棉花，捐献会拿多少？”“怕其他存棉户思想不通，骂自己；怕曾经向自己借棉而没借给的户，看到这次卖棉，说自己小气。”
    解决这些思想问题，开好会议，使干部和代表觉悟提高一步，是开展售棉储棉运动的重要的环节。
    第一，反复地讲清爱国卖花的道理。要用农民切身经验，对比时光，提高农民的政治觉悟。如村干部和人民代表在讨论时有人说：“这是和美帝国主义作斗争。他想封锁咱，想叫咱工厂关门；咱农民放着棉花不卖，等大价钱，不是也把咱人民自己的国家封锁起来了吗？一定要卖给国家，给美帝国主义个迎头痛击！”在回忆过去，对比现在的时光后说：“日本鬼子、蒋匪军在时也种了许多棉花，曾有过一斤茄子一斤棉，一百斤花三、四块钱还卖不了；有了人民政府，棉价才保了险。”“棉花不能吃，还是非卖不可；如果工厂停了工，要买的东西买不到，对咱农民也不利。”经过这样讨论，村干部和人民代表觉悟提高了，同时也感到回去发动群众有了本钱。
    第二，回顾过去的工作中强迫命令的恶果，建立群众路线的作风。许多村干部、代表说：“过去参军、征公粮，不论那项工作，凡是经过从思想上发动群众提高群众觉悟的，都顺利完成了；强迫办法总闹的几头不满意。这次买花如果也用强迫办法，任务就难以完成，而且使群众不满意，倒给以后群众增产棉花留下顾虑。”因为村干部和人民代表了解了爱国卖花的道理，又认识了强迫命令的坏处，所以就能够自动想出许多走群众路线的办法。
    第三，针对棉农具体的思想顾虑，进行说服。存棉较多者，多为较富裕的中农。这是关系中农政策的一个大问题。做好了，购棉就有了保证；做不好，不仅会影响任务的完成，并且会打击群众的植棉情绪，影响对中农的团结。新乡县各界人民代表会议上，省人民政府商业厅厅长针对棉农顾虑，专门解释了政府的政策是：（一）麦价不会跌，因为政府照顾棉农也要照顾种麦的农民。棉价不会再涨；再涨纱厂就织不成布。政府要照顾农民还要照顾工厂。（二）捐献飞机大炮是要增产捐献；我们提倡卖花投资生产，以增产一部分捐献。而且捐献要完全自愿，决不强迫。（三）卖花是爱国、是光荣，其他存棉户思想不通，我们可以用道理打通他们的思想。他们思想觉悟了也会自动把存棉卖给或存给国家，决不会骂先卖棉花的人。对于那些存了许多棉花而不肯出卖的人，倒是大家都会瞧不起的。曾向自己借棉而未借给的，因为这次是把棉花卖给国家，也会体谅。报告以后效果很好。
