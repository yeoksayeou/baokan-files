　　Graduating Students, Obey Unified Assignment and Participate in National Construction!
　　The State Council of the Central People's Government, in order to meet the needs of national construction, has decided that all graduates of public and private universities and colleges (excluding revolutionary universities, military and political universities, and schools directly led by various business departments) this summer will be uniformly assigned by the Ministry of Personnel and the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government.
　　This policy of the State Council is entirely based on the actual situation of our country. Our country is no longer a backward and weak country, but a strong and unified country, and a beautiful vision of economic construction has emerged before us. The construction undertakings of the new China require a large number of construction cadres in industry, finance, national defense, politics and law, culture and education, etc. However, due to the long-term reactionary rule in the past, China's education is still very underdeveloped, and the number of graduates from universities and colleges is still very small. This very small number of graduates is far from meeting the needs of the development of construction undertakings. Therefore, in addition to vigorously training various construction talents, the People's Government believes that in order to enable the existing small number of university and college graduates to play the greatest role in meeting the needs of the country, it is entirely necessary and of great significance for the state to take unified leadership and make planned allocation and use of them.
　　The young students have adopted a welcoming and supportive attitude towards this solemn call of the motherland. Recently, the vast number of students have responded to this call with practical actions. For example, the graduates of Shandong Agricultural College, Beijing University of Technology, Anhui University, Henan University, and Beijing Agricultural University have all expressed their willingness to unconditionally obey the unified assignment of the motherland. A group of students from Beijing University of Technology wrote in a letter to Chairman Mao: "Chairman Mao, we will go wherever you want us to go, and we will go wherever the motherland wants us to go!" Their actions have been praised by the people and all the students, because they fully demonstrated political consciousness, showed their love for the people's leader and the motherland, and also showed their willingness to dedicate themselves to the cause of national construction.
　　However, there are still a small number of students who have some hesitations about the call of the motherland, and their actions show hesitation. Some students are considering the work area: should they go to Beijing or Shanghai, or to remote areas? Should they go to the countryside or stay in the city? They also thought about future material treatment, family life, marriage, and other issues. It is understandable for graduating students to consider these issues, but they should first remember the truth of "serving the people" that Chairman Mao has constantly taught us, and they should first remember the oath of "responding to the call of the motherland at any time." That is to say, as a patriotic youth of the Mao Zedong era, when they consider their personal future, they should first start from the needs of the motherland, and should not first start from their own personal problems. Because the future of the country is combined with the future of the individual, and only under the condition that the people's motherland obtains broad development can there be a bright future for the individual. Think about it, what were our thousands of martyrs, thousands of volunteer army heroes, and thousands of "most beloved people" fighting for, one after another, shedding blood and sacrificing themselves? Isn't it precisely because of their spirit of sacrificing everything for the interests of the motherland that our country has an infinitely glorious present and an infinitely great future? Compared with them, after being supported by the people for a long time, after receiving the ideological education of serving the people, is it still considered a "sacrifice" to obey the unified assignment of the state upon graduation?
　　The students should also recall what the situation of our young students was like in those years when the dark rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries shrouded the land of the motherland? At that time, students' lives were not guaranteed, they were threatened by hunger in school, and "graduation meant unemployment"; at that time, students had no freedom of thought and politics; the future waiting for students was a long and dark night. Therefore, from the "May Fourth" Movement to the "December 9th" Movement and the "December 1st" Movement..., students launched many vigorous patriotic movements, which gave the Kuomintang reactionaries a major blow and became an important part of the Chinese people's liberation struggle. At that time, the goal of the student movement was to overthrow the reactionaries and build a new China. Now, the reactionary rule of the enemies of the Chinese people has been overthrown, and the Chinese students with a glorious tradition of revolutionary struggle are continuing to carry forward their past patriotic spirit, studying hard, and actively responding to various calls of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, such as resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, applying for military cadre schools, etc. Young students have shown brilliant performance. Therefore, in this unified assignment work after graduation, Chinese students should of course show the due patriotic spirit. Many students worry that the work assigned by the state is not suitable for their interests, their ideals, or their abilities. These concerns should be eliminated, because first, the Central People's Government will, as far as possible, take care of the students' working ability, interests, and other specific difficulties when assigning work in the future, and focus on implementing the principle that learning and application should be as consistent as possible; second, it is impossible and unreasonable to solve the problem completely according to the wishes of each graduating student, and it is bound to be inconsistent with the interests of the motherland. When personal interests and national interests are not completely consistent, young students must resolutely revise their opinions, obey the assignment according to the actual needs of the motherland, happily take up various jobs, and contribute everything to the people's motherland.
　　Students, the beautiful vision of the new China is in front of us, and the motherland is calling us. Our young generation should not hesitate to bravely shoulder the sacred task of consolidating and building our great motherland!

### 毕业同学们，服从统一分配，参加国家建设！

　　毕业同学们，服从统一分配，参加国家建设！
    中央人民政府政务院为了国家建设的需要，决定全国公私立高等学校（革命大学、军政大学以及由各业务部门直接领导的学校除外）今年暑期毕业生一律由中央人民政府人事部、教育部负责统一分配工作。
    政务院的这一方针，完全是从我们国家的实际情况出发的。我们的国家不再是一个落后的、贫弱的国家，而是一个强大统一的国家了，经济建设的美丽的远景已呈现在我们面前。新中国的建设事业需要大量的工业、财经、国防、政法、文教等方面的建设干部。但是由于过去长期的反动统治，中国的教育目前还很不发达，高等学校的毕业生数量目前还很小。这个很小数量的毕业生，远远不能适应建设事业发展的需要。因此，人民政府除了要大力培养各种建设人才以外，为了使现有的为数无多的高等学校毕业生，能对国家的需要发挥最大的效能起见，由国家统一领导，对他们作有计划的分配与使用，是完全必要的，有巨大意义的。
    对于祖国的这一庄严号召，青年同学们采取了欢迎和拥护的态度。最近广大同学已经用实际行动响应了这个号召。例如山东农学院、北京大学工学院、安徽大学、河南大学、北京农业大学等校本届毕业生，都表示要无条件地服从祖国的统一分配。北京大学工学院一群学生在写给毛主席的信里说：“毛主席，您要我们到那里就到那里，祖国要我们到那里就到那里！”他们这种行动，受到了人民和全体同学的赞扬，因为他们充分表现了政治自觉，表现了对人民领袖和祖国的热爱，也表现了愿意为国家建设事业献身的精神。
    但是，也还有一小部分学生对祖国的号召存着某些观望的心理，在行动上表现犹豫。有的同学考虑着工作的地区：是到北京、上海呢，还是到边远的地区呢？是到农村呢，还是在城市呢？他们还想到了将来的物质待遇、家庭生活、婚姻等等问题。毕业同学们考虑到这些是可以理解的，但是他们应该首先记住毛主席所不断教导我们的“为人民服务”的真理，他们应该首先记住“随时响应祖国号召”的誓言。这就是说，作为一个毛泽东时代的爱国青年，当他们在考虑个人的前途时，应该首先从祖国的需要出发，不应该首先从自己的个人问题出发。因为国家的前途是和个人的前途结合着的，只有在人民祖国获得广阔发展的条件下才能有个人的光明前途。想想看，我们的千千万万的先烈们，千千万万的志愿军英雄们，千千万万的“最可爱的人”，他们前仆后继，流血牺牲，是为着什么呢？难道不正是因为有了他们这种为祖国利益牺牲一切的精神，我们的国家才有了无限光荣的现在和无限伟大的将来么？和他们比一下，在受了人民的长期供养以后，在受了为人民服务的思想教育以后，在毕业时服从国家的统一分配，这难道还能称得上“牺牲”吗？
    同学们还应该回忆一下，当国民党反动派黑暗统治的阴霾笼罩着祖国土地的那些年月里，我们青年学生的处境是怎样的呢？那时候，学生的生活毫无保障，在校时被饥饿威胁，而“毕业即是失业”；那时候，学生的思想政治毫无自由；等待着学生的前途是长夜茫茫。因此，从“五四”到“一二九”、“一二一”……学生掀起了许多次轰轰烈烈的爱国运动，给了国民党反动派以重大的打击，成为中国人民解放斗争的重要组成部分之一。当时学生运动的目标就是推翻反动派，建设新中国。现在，中国人民的敌人的反动统治已被推翻，有着光荣革命斗争传统的中国学生，正继续发挥过去的爱国主义精神，努力学习，积极响应中国共产党和人民政府的各种号召，例如抗美援朝、投考军事干部学校等，青年同学们都有了光辉的表现。因此，在这次毕业后的统一分配工作中，中国的学生当然要表现出应有的爱国主义精神。许多同学们担心国家分配的工作不适合他们的兴趣，不适合他们的理想，不适合他们的能力。这些顾虑都是应该消除的，因为第一，中央人民政府将来在分配工作时，将尽可能地照顾学生们的工作能力、兴趣和其它具体困难，着重地贯彻执行学和用尽可能的一致这一原则；第二，要做到完全按照每一个毕业学生自己的愿望来解决，这也是不可能的，不合理的，势必与祖国的利益不相符合的。在个人利益和国家利益发生不能完全一致时，青年同学们就必须坚决地修改自己的意见，按照祖国的实际需要服从分配，愉快地走上各种工作岗位，为人民祖国贡献一切。
    同学们，新中国的美丽远景摆在我们面前，祖国正在向我们召唤，我们年青的一代，应该毫不犹豫地百倍勇敢地负起巩固和建设我们伟大祖国的神圣任务！
