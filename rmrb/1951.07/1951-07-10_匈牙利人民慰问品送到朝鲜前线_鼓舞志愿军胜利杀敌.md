Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 9th: Another batch of gifts from the Hungarian people to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has arrived at the Korean front lines. These gifts have greatly encouraged the Volunteer Army soldiers standing on the front lines of defending world peace.

　　During the battle of Dragon Head in the north of Hengcheng, thirteen warriors of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army held the 559 Highland. When they had defeated three enemy attacks, the Hungarian people's gifts arrived at the position. Deputy Platoon Leader Sun Rongchang shouted loudly, "Comrades! The Hungarian people are expecting us. We must answer their ardent hopes by annihilating more enemies!" After hearing this, the soldiers fought even more bravely, and some continued to fight even after being wounded. In the entire battle, the thirteen warriors killed or wounded a total of more than two hundred enemies and held the position. After receiving the gifts, Zhao Lianshan, a combat hero of a certain unit, wrote a letter to the Hungarian people saying, "When we smoke the cigarettes you sent and eat the white sugar, we feel extremely warm. We deeply feel that there are millions of peace-loving people behind us who are enthusiastically supporting us. The power of the united people of the world who love peace is invincible. The American aggressors' aggression against Korea is bound to fail."

　　匈牙利人民慰问品送到朝鲜前线
    鼓舞志愿军胜利杀敌
    【新华社朝鲜前线九日电】匈牙利人民送给中国人民志愿军的慰问品又有一批送到了朝鲜前线。这些慰问品给予站在保卫世界和平的前线的志愿军战士们很大的鼓舞。
    在横城以北龙头里的战斗中，志愿军某部的十三个勇士据守在五五九高地上。在他们打垮了敌人三次进攻的时候，匈牙利人民的慰问品送到了阵地上。副排长孙荣昌大声喊道：“同志们！匈牙利人民在期望着我们。我们要用消灭更多的敌人来回答他们的热望！”战士们听了以后，作战更加勇敢，有的负了伤还不下火线。在整个战斗中，十三个勇士一共杀伤了二百多个敌人，并且守住了阵地。某部战斗英雄赵连山在收到了慰问品以后，写信给匈牙利人民说：“当我们吸着你们送来的香烟，吃着你们的白糖的时候，感觉到无比的温暖。我们深深感觉到在我们后面有千万个爱好和平的人民在热烈支援我们。全世界和平人民团结起来的力量是无敌的。美国侵略者对朝鲜的侵略是一定要失败的。”
