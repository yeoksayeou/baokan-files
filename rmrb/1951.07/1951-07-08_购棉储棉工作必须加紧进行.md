The "Instruction on the Work of Purchasing and Storing Cotton" issued by the Government Administration Council on June 1st, and the "Call to Guarantee the Completion of the Task of Purchasing and Storing Cotton" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, have aroused great attention from the leading organs of Party organizations, governments, and mass organizations at all levels. They have actively mobilized, deployed, and organized leading organs for purchasing and storing cotton. They have conducted extensive and in-depth propaganda through cadre meetings, farmer representative meetings, and cooperative member meetings, explaining that this work is a major event related to national economic construction and the clothing of the military and civilians. They have called on Party members, Youth League members, cadres, cooperative members, etc., to take the lead in launching a patriotic cotton selling and storing campaign. After a month of efforts, considerable achievements have been made. Some areas have even launched challenges and competitions between villages and counties. Cotton farmers are enthusiastically sending patriotic cotton to the people's government, beating drums and performing Yangko dances. However, from a national perspective, the development of this movement is extremely uneven. Some areas have not yet deployed this work to districts and townships. Some areas have just begun to deploy it. In June, the national (excluding Northeast China) cotton purchase figures only completed four-tenths of the original plan. Given the current situation of nationwide public and private yarn mills suspending work and waiting for cotton, this situation cannot but draw our serious attention. Of course, it takes time for an instruction or decision to be implemented among the masses and transformed into mass action; moreover, June is a busy farming season, which also has a certain impact on cotton purchasing and storage. However, from a subjective point of view, there are also many problems that deserve the attention of various localities.

First, some local governments have insufficient understanding of the serious political significance of the Government Administration Council's instruction, and therefore do not attach enough importance to it, failing to conduct extensive and in-depth mobilization. Some district and township cadres believe: "Why bother with such a big mobilization to buy cotton with money?" The local special district and county people's governments have not seriously checked and corrected this erroneous thinking. Some areas have kept this task at the verbal level, without much understanding of the situation below, and have failed to help lower levels solve problems in a timely manner. For example, the Xingtai Special District of Hebei Province only made general communication and calls for the task of purchasing and storing cotton, without making specific arrangements for districts and townships. Xinxiang, Pingyuan Province, originally planned to hold a county and district farmer representative meeting on June 21, and officially conduct cotton purchasing from July 6 to 15. Although it was later corrected, it was still late. In some areas of southern Shanxi, the work of purchasing and storing cotton is regarded as merely the task of economic organs. Errors of this kind exist to varying degrees in various places.

Second, in some areas, some cadres and some Party members and Youth League members have failed to take the lead in selling and storing cotton. An acquisition team leader of a textile company in Pingyuan Province had 11,000 jin of seed cotton stored at home; the deputy section chief of the business section had more than 3,000 jin of lint cotton stored at home. After the first mobilization by district cadres, the secretary of the Zhangzhuang Party branch of the Communist Party of China in Wuqiao County, Shandong Province, sold 260 jin of cotton. After the second mobilization, he took out another 700 jin, and he firmly stated that he had no more; however, according to others, he still had more than 3,000 jin in storage. This situation should be brought to the attention of the local leading organs.

Third, some cadres use coercive methods to carry out their work, which seriously hinders the purchase and storage of cotton. A rich peasant in Putai County, Shandong Province, had more than 1,000 jin of cotton in storage. Village cadres, eager to complete the task, mobilized him five or six times a day, which increased the other party's concerns and made him even more reluctant to sell. Poor mobilization methods have led some farmers to mistakenly believe that the government is going to confiscate cotton, so they have hidden the cotton. Deng County, Henan Province, once launched a "one jin of cotton per household movement" (which has now been corrected). Some farmers who originally had no cotton had to buy it from other places to pay the task, which caused market fluctuations and was detrimental to cotton purchases.

According to recent typical surveys in various places, farmers do have cotton in their hands. However, due to the above-mentioned reasons and the fact that June is the wheat harvest season, the state's cotton purchase volume has failed to reach the scheduled plan.

After the brewing and preparation in June, the cotton selling and storing situation in July is expected to be better. But there is a prerequisite, that is, we must intensify our efforts subjectively and correct the deviations and shortcomings in our work.

(1) The task of cotton purchase is very heavy, and it cannot be completed by the cadres of the economic departments alone. It is also ineffective for Party and government leading organs to only issue some calls without carrying out specific organizational work. A joint office should be jointly formed by leading organs at all levels and systems to earnestly lead, grasp, and select capable cadres to form work teams and acquisition groups to go deep into the lower levels to supervise and inspect, and to discover and solve problems in a timely manner. The experiences of Shanxi, Hebei, Henan, and other provinces have proved that this is very important. It is even more important for cotton-producing areas that have not yet been mobilized.

(2) The work of purchasing and storing cotton must be combined with patriotic education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. Through various meetings, Party members, Youth League members, cadres, and farmers should be clearly explained that selling cotton to the state is a concrete manifestation of patriotism and the most glorious thing. Everyone should understand the truth that "to get rich, we must protect the country," and "to protect the country is to get rich," and link the fate of farmers with the people's country to enhance farmers' patriotic enthusiasm. Party members, Youth League members, cadres, model workers, and cooperative members are called upon to take the lead, launch challenge competitions, and sell cotton to the state as soon as possible. Some areas in Hebei, Henan, and other provinces have done this, and the result has been successful. Many people reflect: in order to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, we should also take out cotton. We must never let imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek harm us again! Therefore, as long as we can explain the truth to the farmers and break their concerns, the cotton farmers can quickly sell the cotton to the state.

(3) In some areas, the wheat harvest has just ended, and the summer tax is coming one after another, and various shock tasks must be completed. In order to avoid losing sight of one thing while attending to another, all regions should pay special attention to closely combining the task of purchasing and storing cotton with other tasks. Some areas in Henan have combined cotton purchasing and storage with summer tax work, which has proven to be possible and has achieved good results. On the contrary, in some areas of Hebei Province, because the work of eliminating pests and summer tax was not well combined, the work of purchasing and storing cotton was delayed and the opportunity was missed. For example, the two special districts of Handan and Xingtai are expected to start only in mid-July due to the late deployment.

(4) In addition to close cooperation and concerted action among various economic departments of the government, attention should also be paid to organizing cotton merchants and peddlers, mobilizing them to sell existing cotton to the state, and issuing licenses by the government to collect cotton on behalf of the state. This can eliminate the phenomenon of the separation of listed prices and market prices and increase the purchase volume. The experience of Hebei Province has proved that this is successful. In individual areas of Henan Province, the method of giving prizes for spot purchases and the method of generally increasing prices (exceeding the central government's listed price by 5 percent) are used to replace market management. As a result, it has fueled cotton farmers' mentality of being reluctant to sell due to rising prices, giving peddlers an opportunity to take advantage of, and forming a serious situation of the separation of listed prices and market prices.

Time is pressing, and the task is heavy. The situation requires us to work doubly hard and intensively, without the slightest slack or delay. Otherwise, the shutdown of yarn mills will be prolonged, and the clothing of the military and civilians across the country and the stability of prices may be affected. The difficulties of the country will bring universal difficulties to the people. We hope that leading organs, cadres, and the masses in various places will make redoubled efforts.

　　购棉储棉工作必须加紧进行
    张先文
    政务院六月一日“关于购棉储棉工作的指示”及中共中央“保证购棉储棉任务完成的号召”发出后，中共各级党组织、政府及群众团体的各级领导机关，都引起了高度重视，积极动员、布置，组织了购棉储棉领导机关，通过干部会、农民代表会、合作社社员大会等进行广泛而深入的宣传，说明这一工作是关系国家经济建设、关系军民衣着的大事，号召党员、团员、干部、社员等起带头作用，开展爱国主义的售棉储棉运动。经过一个月来的努力，已经取得相当成绩。有些地区并掀起了村与村、县与县的挑战竞赛，棉农群众打着锣鼓、扭着秧歌，到人民政府去送爱国棉，情绪极为热烈。但从全国来看，这一运动的发展是极不平衡的。有些地区至今没有把这一工作布置到区、乡。有些地区还刚在开始布置。六月份全国（缺东北）棉花收购数字只完成原计划十分之四，在目前全国公私纱厂停工待棉的情况下，这种情况不能不提起我们严重的注意。当然，一个指示、决定要贯彻到群众中，变成群众的行动，是需要经过一段时间的；而且六月份正值农忙，对购棉储棉也有一定影响。但从主观方面检查，也有不少问题，值得引起各地警惕。
    第一、部分地方政府对政务院这一指示的严重政治意义认识不足，因而很不重视，未作广泛深入的动员。有些区乡干部认为：“拿钱买棉花，还费这样大的力气动员干什么？”对于这种错误思想，当地专区及县人民政府也没有认真进行检查与纠正。有些地区把这一任务停留在口头上，对下面情况了解不多，也未能及时帮助下级解决问题。如河北省邢台专区对购储棉花任务，只作了一般的传达、号召，未向区、乡作具体布置。平原省新乡原计划六月二十一日开县、区农民代表会，七月六日至十五日正式进行购棉。后来虽经纠正，但毕竟是迟了。山西晋南有的地区，把购棉储棉工作当成只是经济机关的任务。诸如此类的错误，各地或多或少都存在着。
    第二、有些地区，部分干部和部分党员、团员未能在售储棉花中起带头作用。平原省花纱布公司的一个收购组长，家中存籽棉一万一千斤；营业科副科长家中存皮棉三千多斤；山东省吴桥县张庄中共党支部书记第一次经区干部动员，出售棉花二百六十斤，经过第二次动员，又拿出七百斤，他坚决表示没有了；但据别人了解，他还存有三千多斤。这种情形应当提起当地领导机关注意。
    第三、有些干部用强迫命令的方法进行工作，严重地妨害了购棉储棉的进行。山东省蒲台县一富农有存棉一千多斤，村干部急于完成任务，有五个人分头去动员他，每天动员五、六次，结果使对方顾虑增大，更不敢出售了。动员方式不好，使有些农民误认为政府要没收棉花，因而把棉花藏了起来。河南省邓县曾发动“一户一斤棉运动”（现已纠正），有的农民本来无棉，不得不向外地抢购来缴任务，结果引起市场波动，反而对购棉不利。
    据最近各地典型调查，农民手里确实还存有棉花。但由于上述种种原因及六月份正逢麦收季节，致使国家的棉花收购数量未能达到预定计划。
    经过六月份的酝酿与准备，七月份的售棉储棉情况估计可能好一些。但有一个先决条件，就是要主观上加紧努力，并纠正工作中的偏向与缺点。
    （一）棉花收购任务很重，单靠经济部门的干部是不能完成的。党政领导机关只发一些号召，而不进行具体的组织工作，也是不能奏效的。应该由各级各系统领导机关共同组成联合办公室，认真领导、掌握，并抽出得力干部，组成工作队、收购小组，深入下层督促检查，及时发现问题，解决问题。这一点，山西、河北、河南等省的经验已经证明是非常重要的。对于还未动起来的产棉区，则更为重要。
    （二）购棉储棉工作必须与抗美援朝的爱国主义教育相结合。通过各种会议，向党、团员、干部和农民讲解清楚：把棉花卖给国家就是爱国主义的具体表现，也是最光荣的事情。要使大家认识“发家必须保国”、“保国才能发家”的道理，将农民的命运和人民国家联系起来，提高农民爱国热情。号召党、团员、干部、劳动模范、合作社社员起带头作用，发起挑战竞赛，把棉花尽快卖给国家。河北、河南等省有些地区这样做了，结果是成功的。许多群众反映：为了抗美援朝，也应该把棉花拿出来。我们决不能让帝国主义和蒋介石再来残害我们！所以，只要能给农民讲清道理，打破顾虑，棉农群众是可以将棉花迅速卖给国家的。
    （三）有些地区麦收刚过，夏征接踵而来，各种突击任务都要完成。为了不致顾此失彼，各地区应特别注意将购棉储棉任务与其他任务密切结合起来。河南有些地区将购储棉花与夏征工作结合进行，已经证明是可能的。并收到好的效果。相反的，河北省有些地区因为没与除虫、夏征很好结合，就使购储棉花的工作推迟，耽误了时机。如邯郸、邢台两专区因布置较晚，预计要到七月中旬才能开展起来。
    （四）政府各经济部门除应密切配合、一致行动外，还应注意把棉商小贩组织起来，动员他们将现存棉花卖给国家，并由政府发给证照，代国家收棉。这样可以消灭牌价与市价脱节现象，增加收购量。河北省的经验已证明这样做是成功的。河南省个别地区采用现购有奖办法和普遍机动提价办法（超过中央规定牌价百分之五）来代替市场管理，结果是助长了棉农看涨惜售心理，给小贩以可乘之机，形成牌价与市价脱节的严重情势。
    时间是紧迫的，任务是繁重的。形势要求我们加倍努力地紧张工作，不能有丝毫松懈和耽搁。否则纱厂停工期间就会延长，全国军民的衣着和物价的稳定可能受到影响。国家的困难，将给人民带来普遍的困难。望各地领导机关、干部、群众加倍努力。
