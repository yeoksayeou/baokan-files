　　Comrade Liu Shaoqi's Speech Celebrating "July 1st"
    Published in Full by Soviet Pravda
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd. The Soviet Pravda on the 2nd published in full Comrade Liu Shaoqi’s speech at the celebration of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China in Beijing, the joint declaration of various democratic parties and non-party democratic人士 celebrating "July 1st" in China, the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and news of congratulations from fraternal parties in Germany, Poland, Hungary, Japan, Mongolia and other countries on the 30th anniversary of the founding of the CPC.
    Kemer, the defense lawyer for the seventeen Communist Party cadres, stated that the indictment was not specific enough and that he was prepared to file a motion to dismiss the indictment, therefore he requested the court to grant the defendants sufficient time to prepare the motion and to hold the trial in September. However, Judge Ryan ruled that the defendants could only be given half a month's grace and stipulated that the motion must be filed by July 18.
    On the same day that the seventeen Communist Party cadres appeared in court, Feierde, the bail fund manager of the American Civil Rights Congress, and Gelin were also summoned to court (the "Civil Rights Congress" had paid bail for the previously arrested eleven leaders of the American Communist Party). Prosecutor Seibell insisted that they tell the whereabouts of the four American Communist Party leaders who did not appear in court on July 2. When they stated that they did not know, Seibell unreasonably demanded that they hand over the list of donors to the bail fund. They immediately refused this illegal demand based on the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, and Judge Ryan even threatened to add the crime of "contempt of court." After the defendant's defense lawyer argued and requested time to present further reasons, the judge finally allowed the postponement of the verdict on the two until July 5.
    It is now increasingly clear that the US authorities are stepping up their judicial persecution of the American Communist Party and threatening those who defend civil rights with retaliatory measures. US Attorney General McGrath has explicitly declared that if anyone "assists the four Communist Party leaders to evade arrest," the government will prosecute them.

　　刘少奇同志庆祝“七一”讲话
    苏真理报全文刊载
    【新华社莫斯科三日电】二日苏联真理报全文刊载了刘少奇同志在北京中国共产党成立三十周年庆祝大会上的讲话，中国各民主党派及无党派民主人士庆祝“七一”的联合宣言，苏联共产党中央委员会致中国共产党中央委员会的贺电，和德、波、匈、日本、蒙古等国兄弟党祝贺中共成立三十周年的消息。
    十七名共产党干部的辩护律师凯姆尔声明公诉状不够具体，他准备提出申请，要求撤消这个公诉，因此他要求法庭给予被告以充分的时间以准备申请书，到九月再开庭。但法官赖恩裁判只能给被告半个月的宽限，规定于七月十八日就必须提出申请书。
    与十七名共产党干部出庭同日，美国“民权保障大会”保释金基金管理人费尔德及哥林亦被传出庭（“民权保障大会”曾出钱为前被捕十一位美共领袖保释）。检察官赛波尔一定要他们说出七月二日未到庭的四位美共领袖的下落。当他们说明自己并不知道时，赛波尔竟无理地要求他们交出保释金基金捐助人的名单。他们即根据宪法修正案第五条拒绝这种非法要求，法官赖恩竟威胁要以“蔑视法庭”罪相加。后经被告辩护律师申辩并请给予时间以便提出进一步理由，法官始准予延至七月五日再对二人作判决。
    现在已愈来愈明显，美国当局正加紧扩大他们对美国共产党的司法迫害，并以报复手段威胁保卫民权的人士。美国司法部长麦格拉斯曾明白宣告，若有人“协助四名共产党领袖逃避逮捕”，政府就将对之起诉。
