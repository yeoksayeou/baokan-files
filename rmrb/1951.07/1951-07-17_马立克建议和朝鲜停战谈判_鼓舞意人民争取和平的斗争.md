Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 12th Dispatch from TASS: The Soviet Union's representative to the United Nations, Malik's proposal regarding a Korean armistice and the commencement of Korean armistice negotiations have greatly inspired the Italian people's struggle for peace.

Democratic groups, peace committees, and peace-loving Italians throughout Italy are actively participating in the movement to strive for a Korean armistice. They are demanding that further measures be taken to eliminate the threat of war worldwide and to conclude a Five-Power Peace Pact. The Rimini Trade Union Council, representing 32,000 members, issued a statement saying: Thank you to Malik for his proposal, which has encouraged the workers of Rimini to expand the movement to defend peace and to collect signatures for the Peace Pact declaration. The newly elected democratic municipal committees of Modena, Grandolando, Pistoia, and Bescala have also unanimously passed resolutions calling for the defense of peace.

The Korean armistice negotiations have received widespread and enthusiastic support from the Italian people, and the movement to collect signatures for the Peace Pact declaration and the movement against the establishment of US military bases in Italy are also gaining momentum. This situation has made it impossible for many municipal committees controlled by the Christian Democratic Party to ignore the people's ardent desire for peace. The Rome Municipal Committee passed a resolution on the 3rd, hoping that the Korean armistice negotiations could pave the way for consolidating peace. The Venice Municipal Committee also unanimously passed a proposal put forward by opposition municipal committee members, expressing the hope that a Korean armistice could bring peace to the war-torn land of Korea, and that the major powers would conclude truly friendly agreements to ease the international situation. The municipal committees of Naples, Florence, and Bari have also passed similar resolutions.

In addition, the provincial councils of Florence, Arezzo, and Pistoia have also passed resolutions striving for peace.

　　马立克建议和朝鲜停战谈判
    鼓舞意人民争取和平的斗争
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社罗马十二日讯：苏联驻联合国代表马立克关于朝鲜停战的建议和朝鲜停战谈判的开始，大大地鼓舞了意大利人民争取和平的斗争。
    意大利全国各地的民主团体、和平委员会和热爱和平的意大利人，都积极参加争取朝鲜停战的运动。他们要求采取进一步的措施来消除全世界的战争威胁，并缔结五大国和平公约。利米尼工会委员会代表三万两千个会员发表声明说：感谢马立克的建议，它鼓励了利米尼的劳动者去扩大保卫和平的运动，去为和平公约宣言征集签名。新近选出的摩登纳、大兰多、皮斯托雅和贝斯加拉等城的民主市政委员会也一致通过决议，要求保卫和平。
    朝鲜停战谈判得到了意大利人民普遍而热烈的支持，为和平公约宣言征集签名的运动和反对美国在意大利建立军事基地的运动，也越来越声势浩大，这种情况使得连基督教民主党集团控制下的许多市政委员会也不能忽视人民热烈要求和平的意志。罗马市政委员会在三日通过决议，希望朝鲜停战谈判能开辟巩固和平的道路。威尼斯市政委员会也一致通过了由反对党市政委员所提出的提案，表示希望朝鲜停战能给朝鲜备遭蹂躏的土地带来和平，希望从此各大国缔结真正友好的协定，使国际局势缓和。那不勒斯、佛罗伦萨和巴利等城的市政委员会，也通过了同样的决议。
    此外，佛罗伦萨、阿雷佐和皮斯托雅等省的省政委员会，也通过了争取和平的决议。
