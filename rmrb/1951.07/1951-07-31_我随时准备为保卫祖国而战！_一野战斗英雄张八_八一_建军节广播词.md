　　I Am Ready to Fight to Defend the Motherland at Any Time!
　  ——First Field Army Combat Hero Zhang Ba's Broadcast Speech for the "August 1st" Army Day

Dear Comrades:
    I am a combat hero from the First Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and currently the Chief of Staff of a certain battalion. Today, as we commemorate the 24th anniversary of the "August 1st" Army Day, I feel infinitely honored and excited! I know how this honor was obtained, and I also know how to consolidate and promote this honor in the future.
    I was born into a very poor family. The whole family of six had only seven *qing* of alkaline land. My elder brother suffered outside, and I herded sheep and cattle for the landlord, enduring untold suffering and oppression. In August 1943, I broke free from a life worse than that of livestock and joined my own army, the Eighth Route Army. For nine years, under the Party's cultivation and education, I have raised my class consciousness and strengthened my determination to fight to the end for the revolutionary cause. I realize that only by completely eliminating the enemy can the Chinese people be liberated. In many past battles, I always resolutely and bravely completed every combat task assigned to me by the Party. Take the first battle I participated in as an example: that was in the Qilang Mountain battle in Wuzhai in September 1943. The Japanese devils, with several times our strength, tried to encircle us. In order to ensure the safe transfer of the main force, our class of twelve comrades took the initiative to attack the enemy and repelled them with hand grenades, allowing the main force to transfer smoothly. In November 1944, when attacking the Japanese devils' stronghold in Liangjiaping, Wuzhai, I volunteered to join the commando team. Our twelve men quickly rushed to the front of the enemy's pillbox, stuck our guns through the windows into the enemy's room, and forced more than forty enemies to surrender their guns.
    After the Japanese devils surrendered, the Kuomintang reactionaries tried to eliminate our Communist Party and frantically attacked the Liberated Areas. At that time, every one of our commanders and fighters was extremely angry and determined to wipe out the enemy. In June 1946, the first battle of the Jinbei Campaign was to attack Shuoxian. The higher-ups gave me the glorious task of blowing up the city gate. In the dark night, Comrade Feng Shuhuai and I carried the explosives and rushed quickly and bravely to the front of the city gate. When the enemy on the city wall discovered us, hand grenades kept coming down. Taking advantage of the explosion of the enemy's hand grenades, I jumped into the city gate cave in one stride, lit the explosives, and with a bang, the city gate was blown open. At this time, the enemy's hand grenades hit my head again. I quickly ran into the second city gate and blew down the second city gate as well, opening the way for the troops to charge, eliminating the enemy and creating a model of successful explosion. Then came the battle of Guoxian. Guoxian had high walls and deep water, making it difficult for the troops to approach. I was honorably assigned the task of explosion again. Together with the eight comrades in the explosion team, I braved the enemy's intensive fire, quietly waded through the waist-deep river outside the city, and put the explosives against the city gate. With a bang, the city gate was blown to pieces. Another task was successfully completed. In the winter of 1946, the Fenxiao Campaign began, and the first battle was to attack Xiaoyi City. On the night of the start of the attack, I was again assigned the task of blowing up the city gate. I felt that this task was very important, and the first battle must be fought well. Chief of Staff Chai of the regiment asked me, "Are you confident of blowing open the city gate?" I firmly said, "Yes!" I crawled in the snow and looked at the terrain three times in a row, clearly seeing the road ahead and the location for blowing up the city gate. As soon as the mountain guns fired, Comrade Feng Shuhuai and I carried the explosives and ran towards the city gate cave, putting the explosives against the door seam. I quickly pulled the fuse, and it exploded in a few minutes. Our explosion team followed the assault team into the city in the smoke and carried out street fighting with the enemy, eliminating them. None of the eight comrades in our blasting team were injured or killed in many blasting operations, and blasting experts such as Feng Shuhuai, Li Erbai, Hao Aizi, and Wang Zhongshan emerged. We not only mastered this technology, but also created pull-fire explosions and improved blasting technology. Later, a mass blasting learning movement was formed in the entire division. In our unit, even the cooks could tie explosive packs.

    Comrades! I clearly realize that without the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the people would not be liberated, and I, a cattle herder, would not be able to turn over. Although I have achieved a little bit under the Party's cultivation and education, it is still far from enough. I must study harder, learn from the experience of the Volunteer Army in fighting against American imperialism, and improve myself. At last year's National Congress of Combat Heroes and Labor Model Representatives, I learned a lot. I firmly remember Chairman Mao's instructions to play the three major roles of leading, backbone, and bridge at all times to promote the progress of the troops.

    After returning to the troops, I made more than ten reports at the military region, army, division, and regiment levels, with more than 10,000 people listening, which played a certain role in building a modern, regularized national defense force and enhancing the will of the forever fighting team. Today, American imperialism is frantically invading Korea, bombing our Chinese coast and Northeast, and actively arming Japan, preparing to make a separate peace with Japan, wanting to follow the old path of Japanese imperialism in invading our China. But our China is no longer the old China. The people of all China, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, have raised their awareness and clearly recognized who are our relatives and who are our enemies. We do not hope for war, but we are not afraid of war either. We have a strong military force to defend peace.

    We must defend our new China, defend the fruits of the people's liberation, and defend our homes. Not long ago, I received a letter from my family saying that my family of six had been allocated thirty-two *qing* of land and two cave dwellings. My old mother had never worn new clothes since I could remember, but last year the whole family put on new cotton clothes. Elementary schools and literacy classes have been established in the village, and adults and children have the opportunity to study. The letter said that the family is living very well and that the government is taking care of them. They told me not to worry about the family, to defend the country well, to add merit to merit, and to strive for greater glory. The common people are so highly aware, we should work even harder to improve ourselves. From the donations of airplanes and cannons from local areas and the movement to resist America and aid Korea, from the movement of peasants and students to join the army, it fully proves the people's awareness and confidence in victory. Moreover, the military and political training in our troops is in full swing. Take the training situation in our battalion as an example! In our battalion, regardless of cadres or support personnel, everyone is assigned to a class to study. Each company focuses on training small instructors in various military techniques such as grenade throwing and shooting, and launches a mass movement of mutual teaching and learning. I myself, like the soldiers, train on the training ground and in the field. In the two months of May and June, the military technology of the entire battalion has greatly improved, and seven excellent shooters such as Shang Rugang have emerged. Each of them can shoot at least twelve bullets per minute, and all of them are accurate, which has promoted the training of the entire battalion. Many soldiers have become training models. We are now working hard to train soldiers and improve our tactical skills, ready to fight to defend the motherland at any time!

    Comrades! The people have awarded me the glorious title of "Explosion Hero." I cannot live up to this glorious title. Today, as we commemorate the 24th anniversary of the "August 1st" Army Day, I guarantee to the Party and I swear to the people that I will never be arrogant and complacent because the people have given me this honor. In addition to more humbly studying hard and improving my political and cultural level, I must also master modern military technology, especially the military technology of close combat and night combat. I firmly express that, based on past blasting experience, I will learn from the anti-American blasting experience of the Volunteer Army and promote it in the troops, training a large number of blasting experts. We are determined to strive for more anti-tank model groups and more anti-tank heroic companies to emerge in the battle to defend the motherland against aggression.

　　我随时准备为保卫祖国而战！
　  ——一野战斗英雄张八“八一”建军节广播词亲爱的同志们：
    我是中国人民解放军第一野战军的一个战斗英雄，现在是某营的参谋长。在纪念“八一”建军节二十四周年的今天，我感到无限光荣和兴奋！我知道这种光荣是怎样得来的，同时我也知道今后怎样来巩固光荣和发扬光荣。
    我出身在一个非常贫苦的家庭里，全家老小六口人，只有七垧碱地。大哥在外边受苦，我给地主揽羊、放牛，受着说不尽的痛苦和压迫，一九四三年八月，我摆脱了牛马都不如的生活，参加了自己的队伍八路军。九年来，我在党的培养教育下，提高了阶级觉悟，坚定了为革命事业奋斗到底的决心。我认识到：只有彻底地消灭敌人，中国人民才能得到解放。在过去许多战役中，党交给我的每一件战斗任务，我总是坚决勇敢的去完成。就拿我参加的第一次战斗来说吧：那是在一九四三年九月五寨七狼山战斗中，日本鬼子用比我们多好几倍的兵力，想包围我们。为了使大部队安全地转移，我们一个班十二个同志，向敌人主动的出击，用手榴弹打退了敌人，使主力部队顺利地转移。一九四四年十一月里，在五寨梁家坪打日本鬼子的据点时，我自动报名参加了突击队。我们十二个人，迅速地扑到了敌人的碉堡前面，把枪从窗口伸进敌人的房里，逼迫四十多个敌人缴了枪。
    日本鬼子投降以后，国民党反动派想消灭我们共产党，疯狂地向解放区进攻，当时我们每个指战员气极了，都决心要消灭敌人，一九四六年六月，在晋北战役的第一个战斗是打朔县，上级给了我爆破城门的光荣任务。在黑夜里，我同冯树槐同志，扛起了炸药，迅速勇猛地冲向城门跟前，当城上的敌人发现我们时，手榴弹不断地打下来，我趁着敌人的手榴弹爆炸后，一个箭步跳进城门洞，把炸药点着，轰的一声城门炸开了。这时敌人的手榴弹又照着我的头上打，我很快又跑进了第二道城门，又把第二道城门炸倒了，给部队炸开了冲锋的道路，消灭了敌人，创造了爆炸成功的范例。接着是崞县战役。崞县城高水深，部队不容易接近，我又光荣地担任了爆炸的任务，我同爆炸组的八个同志，冒着敌人密集的火力，悄悄地淌过城外半人深的河水，把炸药靠到城门上，轰的一声，城门炸得粉碎。又胜利完成了任务。一九四六年冬天，汾孝战役开始，第一个战斗是攻打孝义城。在开始进攻的这天晚上，我又担任了爆炸城门的任务。我感到这个任务很重要，第一个战斗一定要打好。团里柴参谋长问我：“你有把握炸开城门吗？”我坚决地说：“有！”我爬在雪地里，一连看了三次地形，把前进的道路，爆炸城门的地点，全部看清楚了。山炮一开叫，我同冯树槐同志，扛了炸药跑向城门洞，把炸药靠在门缝上，我将导火索按好，很快一拉，几分钟时间就炸了起来，我们爆炸组就在烟雾中，跟随突击队冲进城去，配合部队和敌人进行巷战，消灭了敌人。我们这个爆破组的八个同志，在好多次爆破中，没有一个伤亡，并且出现了冯树槐、李二白、郝矮子、王中山等爆破能手。我们不但掌握了这个技术，还创造了拉火爆炸，改进了爆破技术。以后在全师形成了群众性的学习爆破运动。在我们就是炊事员也能绑炸药包。
    同志们！我清楚地认识到没有党和毛主席的正确领导，人民得不到解放，我这个放牛娃也翻不了身。我在党的培养教育下，虽然有这么一点点成绩，可是还很不够，我要更好的学习，学习志愿军向美帝国主义作战的经验，提高自己。在去年全国战斗英雄劳动模范代表会议上，我学习了很多东西。牢牢地记着毛主席给我们的指示，要时刻起带头、骨干、桥梁三大作用来推动部队向前进步。
    回到部队以后，在军区、军、师、团各单位作了十多次的传达报告，听的人在一万人以上，对建设现代化、正规化国防军，和增强永远战斗队的意志，起了一定的作用。在今天，美帝国主义正疯狂地侵略朝鲜，轰炸我们中国沿海和东北，并且积极地武装日本，准备单独对日媾和，想走当年日本帝国主义的老路，来侵略我们中国。但是我们中国已经不是旧的中国，全中国的人民在共产党、毛主席的领导下，觉悟提高了，已经清楚地认识到谁是亲人，谁是我们的敌人。我们不希望打仗，但也不怕打仗。我们有强大的军事力量来保卫和平。
    我们要保卫我们的新中国，保卫我们人民的翻身果实，保卫我们的家。不久以前我家来了一封信，说我家六口人，分了三十二垧地，还有两口窑洞。我老娘从我记事那年起，就没穿过新衣服，去年全家都穿上新棉衣。村子里成立了小学，还有识字班，大人小孩有了念书的机会。信上说，家里生活过得很好，还有政府照顾。叫我不要记挂家，好好保家卫国，功上加功，争取更大的光荣。老百姓觉悟都这样高，我们更应该努力提高自己。从地方上的捐献飞机大炮、抗美援朝运动看来，从农民、学生的参军运动看来，都充分证明了人民的觉悟和胜利的信心。再说，我们部队中的军政大练兵，更是热火朝天，就拿我们营里的练兵情况来说吧！我们营里，不管干部、勤杂人员，都编到班里学习。各连有重点地培养了投弹、射击等各项军事技术的小教员，展开了群众性的互教互学，我自己也和战士一样，在操场上野地里操练。五月和六月两个月中，全营军事技术有很大的提高，出现了尚如岗等七个准确迅速的优良射手。他们在一分钟内，每人最少也能射击十二颗子弹，并且都是百发百中，对全营练兵起了推动作用，很多战士当了练兵模范。我们现在正努力练兵，提高战术技术，随时准备为保卫祖国而战！
    同志们！人民封了我“爆炸英雄”的光荣称号，我不能辜负了这个光荣的称号，在纪念“八一”建军节二十四周年的今天，我向党保证，我向人民宣誓，我决不会因为人民给了自己的荣誉而骄傲自满。除了更虚心地努力学习，提高政治、文化水平外，还要掌握近代化的军事技术，特别是近战、夜战的军事技术。我坚决表示，在过去爆破经验的基础上，学习志愿军抗美的爆破经验，在部队中推广，培养大批的爆破能手。我们决心争取在保卫祖国反侵略的战斗中，出现更多的反坦克模范小组，出现更多的反坦克英雄连队。
