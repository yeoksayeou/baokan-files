Xinhua News Agency, London, July 29th: The British Labor government's continued pursuit of a policy of arms expansion and war preparations has further exacerbated Britain's economic crisis.  British Communist Party Deputy Chairman Dutt pointed out on the 22nd: "Just as people are feeling the devastating impact of the expanded arms program on the economy, the Labor government leaders have fallen into a panic."

British Trade Minister Shawcross lamented in a speech on the 24th: "Since the Korean War, rising world prices and the shortage of important raw materials have caused Britain to encounter the most serious problems." These problems are the alarming increase in the trade deficit brought about by the expanded arms program, the re-emergence of the malignant dollar crisis, and the increasing severity of inflation.

Britain's trade deficit reached £148.9 million in June, setting a new record after May. The total trade deficit for the first half of this year was as high as £552 million, an increase of 150% over the same period last year, exceeding 59% of the total deficit for the entire previous year. United Press International's London dispatch on the 22nd revealed: "This adverse trend will continue to develop." "The seriousness of this problem lies in the fact that Britain's arms expansion depends on the continued import of raw materials and related materials. If imports are to be reduced, the arms expansion movement must be delayed."

The huge trade deficit is worsening Britain's balance of payments, and the shadow of a new dollar deficit is expanding. Shawcross admitted: "Not only do we not have a surplus in international payments as we did this time last year, but we must consider dealing with a serious deficit, especially a serious one in dollars." In the second quarter of this year, the entire sterling area's gold and dollar surplus plummeted from $370 million to $54 million. Reuters admitted: This "alarming deterioration" is actually as serious as the situation that occurred before the pound was forced to devalue in 1949. At the current rate, the foreign exchange deficit will exceed £500 million annually. According to United Press International, British experts estimate that even if the income from "invisible exports" (such as insurance premiums, freight and other business income) is included, "Britain's foreign exchange deficit this year will reach 260 million pounds, while last year Britain's foreign exchange still had a surplus of 229 million pounds."

According to United Press International, the Attlee government "admits that the situation is very urgent, and it is reported that it has ordered its experts to fundamentally examine its foreign trade policy, but everyone knows that the methods to save the situation are limited, and there are very few new methods." British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gaitskell could only continue to fiercely demand stricter "wage restrictions" and further reduce people's consumption to increase exports when debating the British economic situation in the House of Commons on the 26th.

However, even at present, the British people are already suffering greatly from inflation. The prices of all kinds of food, clothing, and daily necessities have repeatedly increased, while wages are far behind prices, and the consumption power of the working people is decreasing day by day. Even the notorious Conservative Party leader Churchill recently feigned grief over Britain's inflation, saying: Since the Labor government "came to power, the value of the pound has fallen by more than five shillings." For this reason, he righteously cursed the Labor government for "six years of rule, which has caused more damage to the British economy and finance than Hitler caused."

The London Workers' Daily commented on the economic policies discussed by Gaitskell in the House of Commons on the 27th: "When the cost of living is constantly rising, the government is asking workers to restrain their wage demands." Workers across the country should take action to "strive to conclude a five-power peace pact - this is the only way to save Britain from ruin and war."

### 工党政府扩军备战的恶果  英六月份贸易入超惊人增大  财政大臣竟要人民再勒紧裤带

　　工党政府扩军备战的恶果
　  英六月份贸易入超惊人增大
　  财政大臣竟要人民再勒紧裤带
    【新华社二十九日讯】伦敦消息：英国工党政府继续奉行扩军备战政策，已使英国的经济危机进一步尖锐化。英国共产党副主席杜德在二十二日指出：“当人们正感到扩张军备计划对于经济所发生的毁灭性影响时，工党政府领袖已陷入惊惶失措的境地。”
    英国贸易大臣萧克劳斯在二十四日发表的演说中哀鸣：“自从朝鲜战争以来，世界物价的上涨和重要原料的缺乏使英国遭遇到最严重的问题。”这些问题就是扩张军备计划所带来的贸易入超的惊人增大，恶性美元危机的再度出现，通货膨胀的日趋严重。
    英国贸易入超六月份达一亿四千八百九十万英镑，继五月份之后再创新纪录。今年上半年贸易入超总额高达五亿五千二百万英镑，比去年同时期增加一倍半，超过去年全年入超总额的百分之五十九。合众社伦敦二十二日电透露：“这种恶劣趋势还要继续发展”。“这一问题的严重性在于：英国的扩张军备有赖于继续输入原料和有关物资。假如要削减输入，扩张军备运动就必须延缓下去。”
    巨大的贸易入超使英国的支付平衡每况愈下，新的美元亏空的暗影正在扩大。萧克劳斯承认：“我们不但没有像去年今日在国际支付上能有盈余。相反地我们要考虑对付一笔严重的赤字，特别严重的是在美元方面。”今年第二季，整个英镑区黄金美元盈余由三亿七千万美元剧烈下降到五千四百万美元。路透社承认：这种“惊人的恶化”实际上和一九四九年英镑被迫贬值前所发生的情况同样严重。按照目前的比率，外汇赤字每年将超过五亿英镑。合众社称，据英国专家估计，即使把“无形输出”的收入（如保险费、运费及其他事业的收入）计算在内，“今年英国外汇的赤字也将达两亿六千万英镑，而去年英国的外汇却还有两亿二千九百万英镑的盈余。”
    据合众社透露，艾德礼政府“承认情况非常紧急，而且，据悉已命令其专家根本检查它的对外贸易政策，但是谁都知道，挽救局势的方法是有限的，新办法很少”。英国财政大臣贾兹克尔二十六日在议会下院辩论英国经济情况时只能继续凶恶地要求更严格地“限制工资”和进一步减少人民消费以增加输出。
    然而，即使在目前，英国人民已经在承受着通货膨胀的巨大苦难。各类食品、衣服、日用品一再加价，而工资则远远落在物价的后边，劳动人民的消费能力已经一天比一天地降低。甚至连臭名远扬的保守党头子邱吉尔最近也假惺惺地对英国的通货膨胀表示悲叹，他说：工党政府“执政以来，英镑价值跌落了五先令以上”。为此，他振振有辞地痛骂工党政府“六年的施政，使英国经济和财政蒙受的损害比希特勒造成的损害更加厉害”。
    伦敦工人日报二十七日在评论贾兹克尔在下院所谈论的经济政策时指出：“当生活费用正在不断上涨的时候，政府却要求工人们约束他们的工资要求”。全国工人应行动起来，“努力争取缔结一个五大国和平公约——这是挽救英国免遭毁灭与战祸的唯一途径”。
