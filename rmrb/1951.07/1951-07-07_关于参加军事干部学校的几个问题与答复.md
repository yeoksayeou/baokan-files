Questions and Answers Regarding Enrollment in Military Cadre Schools

　　Q: Why is this military cadre school enrollment primarily targeting junior high school graduates?
　　A: This military cadre school enrollment primarily targets junior high school graduates to satisfy the needs of national defense construction while also considering the needs of national construction in various other aspects. Strengthening national defense is currently a top priority, and we must strive to accomplish it. However, national defense cannot develop in isolation; it is closely linked to the country's economic, cultural, and other constructions. If we only focus on satisfying the needs of national defense and neglect other aspects of construction, national defense will inevitably be affected. This year, the number of university graduates nationwide is far from meeting the needs of various national constructions. The number of high school graduates is insufficient to meet the needs of university admissions. Recruiting more university and high school students to military cadre schools is necessary for national defense, but considering the overall picture, this cannot be done. Doing so would be detrimental to the country's overall construction, which would ultimately be detrimental to national defense. As for this year's junior high school graduates, there are relatively many. Besides meeting the needs of high school admissions, there is still a significant surplus. Recruiting more junior high school graduates to military cadre schools can adequately meet the needs of national defense while also considering the needs of overall national construction, which is beneficial to the entire country.
　　Q: Can the age for enrollment in various military cadre schools be lowered?
　　A: To ensure that students from military cadre schools can take on national defense construction work after graduation, various military cadre schools have stipulated certain age standards for enrollment, which is necessary. However, this requirement should not be understood too mechanically. Generally speaking, except for the air force, artillery, and armored forces military cadre schools, which require students to be at least seventeen years old (individual students who are only two or three months away from turning seventeen, and are very healthy, relatively tall, and have considerable physical strength, can also be admitted at discretion), the age for enrollment in cadre schools of other military branches can generally be lowered by one year, as long as they are at least sixteen years old. This can appropriately expand the scope of admission, making it easier to select the most outstanding students, and ensure that young people whose ages are not too different do not lose the opportunity to participate in national defense construction.
　　Q: Can young people in society (i.e., out-of-school and unemployed youth) apply for military cadre schools? If so, what are the procedures?
　　A: Regarding the issue of young people in society applying for military cadre schools, due to different situations in various regions, the State Council of the Central People's Government has not made uniform regulations and has authorized the military cadre school enrollment committees of major administrative regions to decide on their own based on the situation in their respective regions. Young people in society who intend to apply can directly contact the military cadre school enrollment committees of their local major administrative region or province/municipality.
　　Q: What are the physical standards for enrollment in various military cadre schools?
　　A: Various military cadre schools have different physical requirements, with the air force, navy, armored forces, and artillery schools having relatively strict physical requirements (see the provisions in the enrollment brochure). However, since each of the above military branches still has different departments and jobs, the requirements for mental and physical strength are not entirely the same (for example, the difference between aircrew members in the air force, especially pilots, and general ground crew). Therefore, physical requirements should not be overly strict across the board. Objects whose differential conditions are not too disparate should be accepted as far as possible. As for other military branches, only general health conditions are required, without major diseases or incurable defects. Most students who are now applying for military cadre schools are young people under the age of twenty, who are still in the process of growth and development. Their bodies will quickly become stronger with appropriate exercise and slightly better nutrition.
　　Q: How to implement the principle of voluntary participation in the enrollment process?
　　A: Enrollment of students should be entirely based on the principle of voluntary participation. That is to say, although we hope that outstanding young people can actively respond to the government's call, each young person should decide for themselves whether or not to apply for military cadre schools in accordance with the principle of voluntary participation. Young people who do not apply should not be satirized or discriminated against; instead, they should be welcomed to express their patriotic enthusiasm in other ways.
　　To truly implement the principle of voluntary participation in practice, individual registration should be adopted instead of collective registration, challenge competitions, and other methods, which may create an atmosphere of "must go" or "embarrassed not to go." Because this can easily lead to certain coercive situations. Participating in military cadre schools to strengthen our national defense construction is a glorious cause that is in line with the needs of the country and the interests of the people, and it is also the requirement of the broad masses of the people, especially young students with patriotic traditions. Therefore, this is a conscious and voluntary action of the masses. It is necessary to adhere to the principle of complete voluntariness. Only in this way can we further stimulate the enthusiasm of the broad masses of students.
　　Another effective step in implementing the principle of voluntary participation is to clearly announce the types of military branches and units being recruited in various schools. In this way, each student can face the specific needs of the motherland, consider carefully and fully whether to apply. After registration, they can enter school according to their own wishes.

　　关于参加军事干部学校的几个问题与答复
    问：这次军事干部学校招生为什么要以初中毕业生为主要对象？
    答：这次军事干部学校招生要以初中毕业生为主要对象，主要是为了在满足国防建设需要的前提下，同时照顾到国家各方面建设的需要。充实国防建设在目前是头等重要的任务，我们必须努力去完成它。但因国防建设并不能孤立地发展，它是和整个国家的经济、文化等建设密切联系着的，如果我们只单纯孤立地去满足国防建设的需要，而对其他各方面的建设置之不管，其结果，国防建设也必将受到影响。今年全国大学毕业生远不能满足国家各方面建设的需要。高中毕业生则不敷大学招收新生的需要。多招收大学和高中学生参加军事干部学校，单纯就国防建设来说，是需要的；但从全面着想，不能这样做。因为，这样做不利于国家的全面建设，最后也必将不利于国防建设。至于今年全国的初中毕业生则比较多，除了满足高中招收新生的需要外，尚可有不少余额。多吸收初中毕业生参加军事干部学校，既可适当地满足国防建设的需要，又可照顾到国家全面建设的需要，对于整个国家是有利的。
    问：各种军事干部学校招收学生的年龄能否降低？
    答：为了使军事干部学校的学生毕业后能够担任国防建设工作，各种军事干部学校都规定了招收学生要有一定的年龄标准，这是必要的。但是对于这种规定的了解也不能过于机械。一般说，除了空军、炮兵、装甲兵等三种军事干部学校招收学生的年龄必须要在十七周岁以上外（个别只差两三个月就满十七周岁的学生，如果身体很健康，个儿又相当高，体力也相当大的，也可酌情录取。），其他兵种干部学校招收的学生一般都降低一岁，只要在十六周岁以上也就可以了。这样既可适当扩大录取范围，便于从中选择最优秀的学生；又可使年龄相差不多的青年也不失掉参加国防建设的机会。
    问：社会青年（即失学、失业青年）可否投考军事干部学校？如果可以投考，其手续如何？
    答：关于社会青年投考军事干部学校的问题，因为各地情况不同，中央人民政府政务院未做统一规定，授权各大行政区军事干部学校招生委员会根据本地区情况自行决定。各地社会青年如拟投考者，可直接向当地大行政区或省、市军事干部学校招生委员会接洽。
    问：各种军事干部学校招生的体格标准如何？
    答：各种军事干部学校有各种不同的体格要求，其中以空军、海军、装甲、炮兵等四种学校体格要求比较严格（见招生简章的规定）。但由于以上每一兵种内部仍有不同的部门和工作，其对脑力与体力等的要求也不尽相同（例如空军当中的空勤人员，特别是其中的驾驶员与一般地勤人员的区别）。因此在体格要求上不应一律的过分严格。对于区别条件相距不太悬殊的对象，应该尽量接受，至于其他兵种，则只要合乎一般的健康条件，无重大疾病或不可矫治的缺点即可。现在报名参加军事干部学校的学生，大多为二十岁以下的青年，都还在继续生长发育期中，他们的身体在获得适当的锻炼机会，和稍好的营养条件下很快就会更加强壮起来。
    问：在招生过程中怎样贯彻自愿的原则？
    答：报名学生均应完全以自愿为原则。这就是说，我们虽然希望优秀的青年能够积极响应政府的号召，但是每一个青年是否报名参加军事干部学校，应完全按照自愿的原则由个人自己决定，对于不报名的青年们，不得加以讽刺或歧视，而应该欢迎他们用别的方式来表示爱国热诚。
    为了在实际工作中真正能贯彻自愿原则，应该采用个别报名的办法，而不要采用集体报名，挑战竞赛等方式，造成“非去不可”或“不去不好意思”的气氛。因为这样容易产生某些强制的情形。参加军事干部学校加强我国国防建设，这是符合国家需要和人民利益的光荣事业，也是广大人民、特别是在具有爱国传统的青年学生的要求，因此，这是群众自觉自愿的行动。必需坚持完全自愿的原则。只有如此，才能更加发挥广大学生的积极性。
    贯彻自愿原则的又一有效步骤，即必须在各个不同的学校明确公布招考的兵种单位，这样，每一个同学就可以面对祖国的具体需要，缜密地、充分地去考虑自己是否报名。报名之后又可以按照自己的志愿入学。
