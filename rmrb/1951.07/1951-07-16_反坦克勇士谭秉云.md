Anti-Tank Warrior Tan Bingyun
　　In the late May blocking battle on the south bank of Zhaoyang River, Tan Bingyun, a Communist Party member and squad leader of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, consecutively destroyed two enemy tanks and, together with his comrade Wang Zhenyu, destroyed another, earning him a special class merit.

　　On the night of May 24th, Tan Bingyun and Wang Zhenyu chose a location, dug their fortifications, and waited to engage the tanks. It wasn't until after six o'clock the next morning that two enemy medium tanks lumbered up. The enemy tanks were firing their cannons wildly along the way. Tan Bingyun remained calm, waiting for the first tank to approach him closely, and when the tank fire couldn't hit him, he leaped out and threw an anti-tank grenade at the tank turret, silencing the cannon. He then threw another grenade, hitting the front of the tank and destroying it. Because he was so close to the tank, shrapnel bounced back and injured his head.

　　As the second tank approached, Wang Zhenyu was bandaging his wound. Hearing the rumbling sound, he grabbed an anti-tank grenade without waiting for the bandage to be finished. When the tank came close, he threw the grenade, hitting the turret. Wang Zhenyu immediately followed up with another grenade, damaging the tank. At this point, the tank turret hatch opened, and an American soldier leaned out, firing an automatic weapon, attempting to jump out and escape. Tan Bingyun shot him dead with his submachine gun. The second American soldier in the tank, using the dead body as cover, continued to crawl out and fire, wounding Wang Zhenyu. Tan Bingyun was enraged, picked up his submachine gun, rushed over, and ended that fellow's life. The enemy infantry following behind the tanks scurried back in panic. Tan Bingyun, wounded, returned to his own position. But he didn't rest, and instead fetched four more anti-tank grenades, preparing to fight again.

　　Before long, six more enemy tanks charged over, firing fiercely at Tan Bingyun's fortifications. The resourceful warrior had already moved to another position. Just as the enemy tanks were blindly firing their cannons, Tan Bingyun's anti-tank grenade exploded at the rear of the first tank, and the tank immediately burst into flames, scaring the remaining five tanks into turning around and fleeing. More than twenty tanks and thirty cars following behind these tanks, seeing the situation was unfavorable from afar, also turned around and ran away.

　　At this time, the ambushing infantry warriors used their machine guns to sweep the enemy infantry on the cars, inflicting heavy casualties on them. The superior enemy, possessing dozens of tanks, was so frightened by Tan Bingyun's heroic actions that they dared not advance for eight hours. When Tan Bingyun returned to the position with glorious wounds, he was warmly cheered by his comrades.

　　反坦克勇士谭秉云
    于凤坤　孟子皿
    在五月底的照阳江南岸的阻击战中，志愿军某部班长共产党员谭秉云连续击毁敌人坦克两辆，另外又和战友王振玉一起击毁了一辆，因而立了一次特等功。
    五月二十四日夜晚，谭秉云和王振玉选择好一处地方，挖好了工事，等着打坦克。一直到第二天早上六点多钟，有两辆敌人的中型坦克爬来。敌人的坦克一路乱打着炮。谭秉云沉住气，等第一辆坦克接近了他，而坦克炮火打不着他的时候，纵身一跃，向坦克炮塔扔去一个反坦克雷，把那门炮打哑了。他接着又扔过去一个雷，正击中坦克前部，把那坦克炸毁了。由于他离坦克很近，以致弹片蹦回来打伤了他的头部。
    当第二辆坦克爬来时，王振玉正在替他包扎伤口。他听到隆隆的声音，没有等伤口包扎好，就拿起反坦克雷。等坦克爬近时，他又把雷扔了过去，击中了炮塔。王振玉紧接着再补上一颗雷，把坦克打坏了。这时，坦克炮塔盖打开了，一个美国兵探身出来，拿着自动武器向外边射击，企图跳车逃命。谭秉云就用冲锋枪把他打死了。坦克里的第二个美国兵借着死尸作掩护，继续钻出身来射击，把王振玉打伤了。谭秉云怒不可遏，端起冲锋枪冲过去，结束了那家伙的性命。跟在坦克后面的敌人的步兵，慌忙往回窜。谭秉云带着伤也回到自己阵地上来。可是，他没有休息，又去取来了四个反坦克雷，准备再打。
    不一会，又有六辆敌人的坦克冲了过来，向着谭秉云的工事猛烈打炮。机智的勇士早就转移到另一处阵地上去了。正当敌人坦克盲目乱打炮的时候，谭秉云的一颗反坦克雷在第一辆坦克的尾部开了花，那辆坦克顿时燃起了浓焰烈火，吓得其余的五辆坦克掉头就跑。跟在这几辆坦克后面的二十多辆坦克和三十多辆汽车，远远地看见形势不妙，也扭头就逃。
    这时，埋伏着的步兵勇士们，用机枪对准了汽车上的敌人步兵猛扫，给予他们重大杀伤。拥有几十辆坦克的优势敌人，被谭秉云的英雄举动吓得八个钟头不敢前进。当谭秉云带着光荣的创伤回到阵地时，他受到了战友们的热烈欢呼。            （新华社）
