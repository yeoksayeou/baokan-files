　　Xinhua News Agency, July 13th: TASS, New York, July 12th: The "American Peace Crusaders" organization issued a report to the press, pointing out that the leaders of the organization sent a telegram to President Truman on July 11th, requesting that the Korean armistice negotiations be successfully completed as soon as possible.

　　The "American Peace Crusaders" suggested that after the Korean negotiations, major powers should discuss and resolve all Far Eastern issues to prepare conditions for negotiations between major powers to resolve all international disputes.

　　This telegram from the "American Peace Crusaders" is the first of one million letters and telegrams expected to be sent to Truman demanding the establishment of lasting peace.

　　The plan to launch this new peace movement was formulated by the leaders of the "American Peace Crusaders" in Chicago last week. In addition to sending letters and telegrams requesting the establishment of lasting peace, 100,000 rallies and symposiums to defend peace will be held across the country, and delegations will be sent to visit officials of the United Nations and the United States government.

　　The report said that local peace committees across the country are actively preparing for this movement. For example, leaders of the Maryland Peace Committee reported that they have sent ninety letters to leading cadres of local trade unions and two hundred and fifty letters to church pastors, asking them to support proposals for concluding a Korean armistice agreement and convening a conference of major powers.

　　The leadership of the "American Peace Crusaders" is preparing to send mass delegations to the United Nations Secretariat and the Security Council in the near future. Many groups that previously did not cooperate with the "American Peace Crusaders" will also send representatives to participate in the delegation to the United Nations.

　　Many cities in the United States are organizing city-wide rallies to defend peace.

　　Xinhua News Agency, July 13th: TASS, London: According to the British *Daily Worker*, many local leaders of the labor movement in Britain have expressed their support for the Korean armistice proposal, and they are calling for intensified efforts to ensure lasting and universal peace. Hawleyway, general secretary of the National Automobile Workers' Union, said: "People are delighted to hear that it is possible to establish peace in Korea. I hope this is the beginning of peace talks around the world. Mankind yearns for peace, and all good people should promote the realization of this goal."

　　Gardner, general secretary of the Foundry Workers' Union, which has 80,000 members, said that Malik's broadcast speech was well received. He supports efforts currently being made to reach a Korean armistice agreement.

　　The annual meetings of the National Union of Mineworkers and the National Union of Railwaymen last week both expressed support for peace. The *Daily Worker* emphasized in this regard that the vast majority of delegates attending the two conferences were Labour Party members, and although they would prefer a Labour government, "like the broad masses of the British people, they are very disgusted with the current dangerous war preparations. They hope that after the Korean ceasefire, they will openly seek a general peaceful solution to the Far East issue."

　　“美国和平十字军”发动和平运动
     要求早日完成朝鲜停战谈判
     英国许多工运领袖拥护朝鲜停战建议
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社纽约十二日讯：“美国和平十字军”组织向报界发表报告，指出该组织领袖已在七月十一日向杜鲁门总统发出电报，要求尽速使朝鲜停战谈判胜利完成。
    “美国和平十字军”建议在朝鲜谈判之后，大国应讨论并解决一切远东问题，以便为大国间解决一切国际争端的谈判准备条件。
    “美国和平十字军”的这封电报是预定要向杜鲁门发出的一百万封要求建立持久和平的信件与电报的第一封。
    发动这个新的要求和平运动的计划是“美国和平十字军”的领袖上周在芝加哥拟定的。除了发出信件与电报要求建立持久和平外，还要在全国各地举行十万次保卫和平的集会和座谈会，并派遣代表团访问联合国组织和美国政府的官员。
    报告说，全国各地方和平委员会正在积极准备这一运动。例如，马里兰州和平委员会的领袖们报告，他们已向各地方工会的领导干部发出了九十封信，向各教堂牧师发出了二百五十封信，请他们支持要求缔结朝鲜停战协定和召开大国会议的建议。
    “美国和平十字军”的领导机构正准备在最近将来派遣群众性的代表团前往联合国秘书处和安全理事会。许多以前不与“美国和平十字军”合作的团体也要派代表参加前往联合国组织的代表团。
    美国许多城市都要组织保卫和平的全市性集会。
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社伦敦讯：英国《工人日报》消息，英国许多地方的工会运动领袖纷纷表示拥护朝鲜停战的建议，他们并号召加紧努力，以确保持久的普遍和平。全国汽车工人工会的总书记豪里威说：“人们听到有可能在朝鲜建立和平，莫不感到欢欣。我希望，这是全世界和谈的开始。人类渴望着和平，一切善良的人们都应该促进这个目的的实现。”
    拥有八万会员的翻砂工人联合会总书记加德纳说，马立克的广播演说得到了响应。他拥护现正设法达成朝鲜停战协定的努力。
    全国矿工联盟与全国铁路工人工会上星期分别举行的年会，均表示拥护和平。《工人日报》就此着重指出，参加这两个会议的代表绝大多数是工党党员，虽然他们都宁愿要工党政府，“可是，他们象英国广大人民群众一样，非常讨厌现在的危险的战争准备。他们希望朝鲜停火以后，开诚布公地设法在远东问题上求得总的和平解决。”
