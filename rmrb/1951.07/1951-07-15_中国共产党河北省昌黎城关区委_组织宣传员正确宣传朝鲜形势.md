　　The CCP Hebei Province Changli Chengguan District Committee
    Organizes Propagandists to Correctly Publicize the Situation in Korea
    The CCP Changli Chengguan District Committee, Hebei, convened a meeting of propagandists to discuss how to correctly publicize the Korean armistice negotiations among the masses in order to strengthen the Resist America, Aid Korea work.
    Some of the masses in Changli Chengguan had developed complacency and slackness due to the start of peaceful negotiations on the Korean issue. Some said: "Now the Korean issue can be resolved peacefully, there is no need to donate airplanes and cannons." Others said: "The war is not going to be fought, let's wait and see about the donation movement!"
    After the CCP Changli Chengguan District Committee discovered these ideological situations, it immediately convened a meeting of propagandists from the entire district on July 6 to discuss how to correctly publicize the Korean armistice negotiations among the masses in order to strengthen the Resist America, Aid Korea work. During the discussion, it was also discovered that some propagandists had some confused ideas on this issue. For example, some propagandists also mistakenly believed that the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue was proposed by the United States. A heated discussion was immediately launched at the meeting. Propagandist Zhang Cuishan said: "Peaceful resolution of the Korean issue is precisely the consistent proposition of the Chinese people. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government has made several statements." Hou Jieru said: "After Malik, the Soviet representative to the United Nations, proposed a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue, the United States expressed its willingness to negotiate peacefully." Everyone also discussed the reasons why the United States accepted peace talks: mainly because the Chinese and Korean People's Army achieved great victories in the Korean War and the victory of the people's peaceful struggle around the world. Otherwise, peaceful negotiations would be impossible. Then the discussion turned to the issue of continuing to strengthen the Resist America, Aid Korea work. Bai Hanqing said: "The war is still going on in Korea, and the people of the whole country must continue to strengthen the Resist America, Aid Korea work, and there must be no slackening." Zhang Shide then added: "Even after the ceasefire and truce, we must continue to consolidate national defense in order to have the strength to stop any imperialist aggression." Finally, everyone unanimously agreed that the Chinese people are in favor of a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, which is precisely the consistent proposition of the Chinese people. However, we must not be complacent and slack, and we must continue to strengthen the Resist America, Aid Korea work. Propagandists should explain these truths to the broad masses, continue to carry out the movement to increase production and make donations, and consolidate national defense. And we must earnestly give preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the families of the People's Liberation Army.

　　中国共产党河北省昌黎城关区委
    组织宣传员正确宣传朝鲜形势
    中共河北昌黎城关区委会，召开宣传员会议，讨论如何在群众中正确地宣传朝鲜停战谈判问题，以加强抗美援朝工作。
    昌黎城关部分群众，曾因朝鲜问题开始和平谈判而产生了麻痹松懈思想。有的说：“现在朝鲜问题已可以和平解决，不用再捐献飞机大炮。”有的说：“仗不打了，捐献运动听听再说吧！”
    中共昌黎城关区委会发现这些思想情况后，即于七月六日召开全区宣传员会议，讨论如何在群众中正确地宣传朝鲜停战谈判问题，以加强抗美援朝工作。在讨论中，同样发现有些宣传员对这一问题存在一些糊涂观念。例如有的宣传员也错误地认为：和平解决朝鲜问题是美国提出来的。会上即展开了热烈的讨论。宣传员张翠山说：“和平解决朝鲜问题正是中国人民一贯的主张，中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长已作过数次声明。”侯介儒说：“苏联驻联合国代表马立克，提出和平解决朝鲜问题后，美国才表示愿意和平谈判的。”大家也就讨论到美国接受和平谈判的原因：主要是因为中、朝人民军在朝鲜战争中取得了伟大的胜利及全世界人民和平斗争的胜利。否则是不可能进行和平谈判的。接着讨论到继续加强抗美援朝工作的问题，白汉卿说：“现在朝鲜还在打仗，全国人民必须继续加强抗美援朝工作，绝不能有半点松懈。”张世德便补充说：“即便在停火休战以后，也还要继续巩固国防，才能有力量制止任何帝国主义的侵略。”最后大家一致认为：中国人民是赞成和平解决朝鲜问题的，这正是中国人民一贯的主张。但是不能因此麻痹松懈，要继续加强抗美援朝工作。宣传员就应当把这些道理向广大群众说明白，继续开展增产捐献运动，巩固国防。并要认真优待革命烈士家属、人民志愿军和人民解放军的家属。
