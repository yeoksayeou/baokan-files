　　Overcome Lax Thinking, Strengthen Leadership in Cotton Purchasing Work
　　Xingtai Special District's Cotton Selling and Storage Begins to Form a Mass Movement
　　Time is Very Tight, the Task is Increasingly Arduous, We Should Redouble Our Efforts!
    Xingtai Special District is one of the main cotton-producing areas in Hebei Province, with over 2.15 million mu of cotton planted last year. Before June 26th, the cotton selling and storage work in the special district had not been fully launched in various counties, except for significant achievements in typical demonstration villages. The main reason was that the party and government leading organs in the special district and counties did not take the lead firmly. Most county and district party and government leading cadres believed that their responsibility was only to issue instructions and make appeals; the specific execution was the business of the China National Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Corporation and cooperatives. Some counties lacked confidence in completing the task and did not study how to complete it, but instead looked for negative materials to resist. One county's task was 3 million jin; they casually calculated and said they could only complete 600,000 jin. Some counties blindly said, "The task cannot be completed anyway." Therefore, when assigning tasks to various districts, they said, "Complete as much as you can." As a result, they relaxed their ideological and organizational leadership over cotton purchasing and storage work.

    In order to reverse this situation, the Xingtai Special District Financial and Economic Committee held county financial and economic committee meetings in Wei County, Xingtai, and Nangong on June 26th, respectively, to re-mobilize and inspect. It was decided to strengthen leadership with the party committee as the core, reorganize, and catch up quickly. Then, based on the investigation materials of typical villages, it was definitely pointed out that the cotton storage volume in general villages in cotton-producing areas was around 15%. Qianwutai Village in Wei County (which can represent the situation in 1.7 million mu of cotton fields in nine counties including Nangong, Wei County, Julu, Guangzong, and Xinhe) planted 1,600 mu of cotton last year, with a yield of 110 jin per mu, a total yield of 176,000 jin, and a current storage volume of 23,000 jin, accounting for slightly over 13% of the harvest. Among them, there were eight households with more than 1,000 jin in storage, seventeen households with more than 500 jin, and fifteen households with more than 100 jin. Dongmeng Village in Nangong, with only over 50 households, sold and stored more than 5,500 jin of cotton to the state, with an average storage of 110 jin per household, accounting for 17% of the total harvest. In semi-cotton-producing areas such as Beiding Village in Ren County, 1,800 mu of cotton were planted last year, yielding 126,000 jin. Besides the public grain and the masses' own use, there are still 20,000 jin in storage, accounting for slightly over 15% of the harvest. The storage volume in newly cotton-producing areas is generally around 10%. Taking Dongjiujia in Shahe as an example, the village planted 1,300 mu of cotton last year, with a current storage volume of over 11,000 jin, accounting for 9% of the total harvest. From the perspective of various classes in the countryside, old and middle peasants have the most storage, and new middle peasants and village cadres also have a lot of cotton in storage. Taking Beiding Village in Ren County as an example, nine old and middle peasants have 4,400 jin of cotton in storage. Among them, Zhang Dianchen's family harvested 1,500 jin of cotton last year and currently has 700 jin in storage. Seven new middle peasants have 900 jin of cotton in storage. Among them, Zhao Weifu's family harvested 600 jin of cotton last year, bought a calf, built three adobe rooms, and still has 140 jin in storage. The 211 village cadres in Wei County have a total of 30,000 jin of cotton in storage at home. These investigation materials strengthened everyone's confidence in completing the task. After thorough mobilization at all levels, by early July, the patriotic cotton selling and storage work began to form a mass movement and achieved considerable results. According to statistics, the district received more than 1.23 million jin of cotton in May, 800,000 jin in the first and middle ten days of June, 890,000 jin in the last ten days of June, and 940,000 jin in the first ten days of July, for a total of more than 3.86 million jin, accounting for slightly less than 50% of the total task for May, June, July, and August.

    In the cotton purchasing and storage work since late June, various places in the district have made efforts in the following aspects.
  Thorough Ideological Mobilization · Pay Attention to Mobilizing Women
    I. Comprehensive and thorough ideological mobilization. The mobilization steps were first within the Party and then outside the Party, from organized masses to unorganized masses. Mobilization was carried out according to systems such as youth, women, cooperative members, and militia. Teachers mobilized students, and students mobilized parents. If one or two mobilizations were unsuccessful, they were patiently and repeatedly carried out. Using the facts that the Party and the government guarantee the interests of cotton farmers and improve their lives, and comparing them with the times before liberation, the peasants were able to distinguish the good and bad of the new and old social systems and understand the principle of "only by protecting the country can we prosper." At the same time, combined with the commemoration of "July 7th," the masses were inspired to recall the atrocities of the Japanese invaders, expose the current crimes of American imperialist aggression, and explain that "selling and storing cotton is supporting the front line." The village head of Xiguan Village in Nangong used the fact that the U.S. imperialism wanted to rearm Japan to alert the masses and inspire patriotic enthusiasm, making "selling and storing patriotic anti-American cotton" the action slogan of the broad masses. The whole village completed the task of 7,000 jin and exceeded it by 120 jin. After patriotic education, merchants in Nangong City sold and stored nearly 20,000 jin of cotton in three times.

    In mobilizing cotton sales, special attention was paid to mobilizing women. The Women's Federation of Nangong County fully mobilized women in Wangdaozhai Village, and sold and stored more than 15,000 jin of cotton in five days. The first mobilization in Dingjiazhuang only mobilized 2,000 jin. After mobilizing women and organizing mutual persuasion, another 3,000 jin were mobilized.
  Universally Set Up Cotton Collection Stations · Supply Necessary Materials
    II. Under the unified leadership of the Party Committee as the core, cotton collection stations were universally set up in cotton-producing areas based on the village-centered cooperative, consisting of cadres from the company, cooperative, cadres leading the village area, and propagandists from the local village. In addition to being responsible for cotton collection, they were also responsible for the supply of materials such as fertilizers, general merchandise, and grain. The cotton collection stations set up reception sheds to receive peasants. They also conducted policy propaganda, ensuring fair weighing and accurate grading. When cotton-selling peasants had opinions, they were quickly evaluated to ensure that the masses did not carry back a single bag. After the purchase, they were issued a "Patriotic Cotton Sales Certificate," which the masses were very satisfied with. Some cotton stations in Wei County went to the countryside to purchase cotton and promote the goods that the masses loved, which was even more popular. Wangshigong Village was a so-called "no cotton village," but as a result, it also received more than 2,500 jin. Among them, 1,200 jin were exchanged for favorite goods. In order to strengthen leadership, the special commissioner's office and the county level also selected capable cadres from the Party Committee, the government, and economic departments to form an inspection team to go deep into the county, district, village area, and cotton station to check the situation, solve problems, and exchange experiences. The main cadres of the district were not fixed in one village area or one village, but implemented mobile guidance, which played a significant role and solved the difficulty of having fewer cadres.
  Strict Market Management · Pay Attention to Educating Merchants
    III. In order to strictly manage the market and prevent the disturbance of small merchants, the various localities conducted patriotic education for the small merchants, explaining the reason why they should not compete with the state to purchase cotton, and mobilized the merchants to sell and store their cotton to the state. Those who had difficulties in their lives were organized to process cotton for the state. Those who violated the law were given appropriate punishment. In this way, Nangong, Xinhe, and other places did not have the phenomenon of the listed price and the market price being disconnected. Merchants in Nangong City also sold and stored 22,000 jin of cotton to the state. Wei County's policy on merchants was not clear in cotton collection, and it was mistakenly stipulated that "public companies purchase 70% in the market, and private merchants purchase 30%." In order to grab cotton, the merchants snatched more than 1,900 jin in the city at a price 200 yuan higher than the listed price, and the listed price and the market price were once disconnected to 300 yuan (per jin of seed cotton). This not only fueled the cotton farmers' idea of waiting for high prices, but also had a bad impact on the relationship between the Party and the government and the cotton farmers.

    Although the district has achieved considerable results in purchasing cotton, two-thirds of the time has passed, and half of the task has not been completed. The task in the future is even more arduous. Therefore, the leaders of the special commissioner's office and various counties must make redoubled efforts with the greatest political sense of responsibility to complete the task. Calculated at 15% of the storage volume, the district should have more than 8 million jin of ginned cotton in storage. As long as we make the greatest effort, the task can be completed.

### 克服松懈思想，加强对购棉工作的领导  邢台专区售棉储棉开始形成群众运动  时间已很紧迫，任务益形艰巨，应当加倍努力！

　　克服松懈思想，加强对购棉工作的领导
　  邢台专区售棉储棉开始形成群众运动
　  时间已很紧迫，任务益形艰巨，应当加倍努力！
    邢台专区是河北省的主要产棉区之一，去年全区植棉二百一十五万余亩。在六月二十六日以前，该专区的售棉储棉工作除在典型示范村获得显著成绩外，各县都没有全面开展起来。主要原因，是专区以至各县党政领导机关没有抓紧领导。大部分县区党政领导干部认为自己的责任只是发个指示，号召一下；具体的执行，则是花纱布公司和合作社的事情。有些县是对完成任务没有信心，也不研究如何去完成任务，只是找反面材料来抵抗。某县的任务是三百万斤；随便算了个账，说只能完成六十万斤。有的县盲目地说：“任务反正完不成。”因而在向各区布置任务时，便说：“完成多少算多少。”这样，就放松了对购棉储棉工作的思想领导和组织领导。
    为扭转这种局面，邢台专区财政经济委员会于六月二十六日分别在威县、邢台、南宫召开了县财政经济委员会议，重新进行了动员和检查。决定以党委为核心，加强领导，重整旗鼓，急起直追。接着以典型村的调查材料为依据，肯定指出产棉区一般村庄存棉量在百分之十五上下。威县前五台村（可代表南宫、威县、巨鹿、广宗、新河等九县一百七十余万亩棉田地区的情况）去年植棉一千六百亩，每亩产一百一十斤，总产量十七万六千斤，目前储存量为二万三千斤，占收获量的百分之十三强。其中存一千斤以上的八户，存五百斤以上的十七户，一百斤以上的十五户。南宫东孟庄只五十余户，售存到国家的棉花有五千五百余斤，每户平均存棉一百一十斤，占总收获量的百分之十七。半产棉区如任县的北定村，去年植棉一千八百亩，收获十二万六千余斤，除了缴公粮和群众自用外，现在还存二万斤，占收获量的百分之十五强。新产棉区的储存量，一般也都在百分之十左右。以沙河东九家为例，该村去年植棉一千三百亩，现储存量为一万一千余斤，占总收获量的百分之九。从农村各阶层来看，老中农存量最多，新中农和村干部存棉也不少。以任县北定村为例，九户老中农，存棉四千四百斤。其中张店忱一户去年收棉一千五百斤，现存七百斤。新中农七户存棉九百斤，其中赵未福一户去年收花六百斤，买了头小牛，盖了三间坯房，现在还存一百四十斤。威县二百十一个村干部总计，家中存棉三万斤。这些调查材料，使大家增强了完成任务的信心。会后经过逐级深入动员，至七月上旬，爱国的售棉储棉工作开始形成群众性的运动，获得可观的成绩。据统计，该区五月份收棉一百二十三万余斤，六月上、中旬收棉八十万斤，下旬收进八十九万斤，七月上旬收进九十四万斤，总共收进三百八十六万余斤，占五、六、七、八四个月总任务的百分之五十弱。
    在六月下旬以来的购棉储棉工作中，该区各地曾在以下各方面作了努力。
  深入思想动员·注意发动妇女
    一、全面的深入的思想动员。动员的步骤是先党内、后党外，从有组织的群众到无组织的群众。按青年、妇女、合作社社员、民兵等系统进行动员。教员动员学生，学生动员家长。一次二次动员不成功，就耐心地反复地进行动员。以党和政府保证棉农利益，使棉农生活改善的事实，和解放以前的时光进行对比，使农民能区别新旧社会制度的好坏，明白“只有保国才能发家”的道理。同时结合纪念“七七”，启发群众回忆日寇暴行，揭发现在美帝国主义侵略罪行，说明“售存棉花就是支援前线”。南宫西关村长以美帝要重新武装日本来警醒群众，激发爱国热情，使“售存爱国抗美棉”成了广大群众的行动口号，全村完成了七千斤的任务，还超过一百二十斤。南宫城内商贩经过爱国教育，三次售存棉花近二万斤。
    在动员售棉中，特别注意了发动妇女。南宫县妇女联合会在王道寨村充分发动了妇女，五天即售储棉花一万五千余斤。丁家庄头一次动员，只动员出二千斤，后经发动妇女，组织互相规劝，又动员出了三千斤。
  普遍设收棉站·供应必需物资
    二、在以党委为核心的统一领导下，产棉区以片村中心社为基础普设收棉站，由公司、合作干部和领导片村的干部及所在地村庄的宣传员组成。除负责收棉外，还负责肥料、百货、粮食等物资的供应。收棉站设立招待棚，招待农民。并进行政策宣传，保证过秤公平，验级准确。售棉农民有意见时，迅速进行评议，保证不使群众背回去一包。收购以后并发给“爱国售棉证”，群众很满意。威县有的棉站下乡收购，推销群众心爱的货，更受欢迎。王世公村是所谓“没棉村”，结果也收到二千五百多斤。其中一千二百斤换了心爱货。专署、县两级为加强领导，并抽调党委、政府、经济部门得力干部组成检查组，深入县、区、片村、棉站，检查情况，解决问题，交流经验。区主要干部不固定在一片村，一个村，而实行流动指导，作用很大，解决了干部少的困难。
  严格市场管理·注意教育商贩
    三、为严格市场管理，制止小商贩的扰乱，各地对小贩进行了爱国主义的教育，说明不应与国家争购棉花的道理，并动员商贩把存棉售、存给国家。对其中生活困难的，组织他们为国家加工。有违犯法令者，予以适当的处分。这样，南宫、新河等地就没有牌价和市价脱节的现象。南宫城内商贩并将存棉二万二千斤售存给国家。威县在收棉中对商贩的政策不明确，错误地规定“公家在市场收购百分之七十，私商收购百分之三十”，商贩为抢购棉花，在城内以高于牌价二百元的价格一集抢购一千九百多斤，牌市价一度脱节至三百元（每斤籽棉）。这不仅助长了棉农等待高价思想的滋长，且对党和政府与棉农的关系发生不好的影响。
    该区收购棉花虽已取得相当成绩，但时间已过三分之二，任务还有一半没有完成，今后任务是更艰巨的。因此，专署和各县领导干部必须以最大的政治责任心，为完成任务而加倍努力。全区按储存量百分之十五计，存有皮棉应为八百余万斤。只要作最大的努力，任务是可以完成的。
