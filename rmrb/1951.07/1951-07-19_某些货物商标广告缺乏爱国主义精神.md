  Some Goods' Trademarks and Advertisements Lack Patriotism

  (I) To the Editor:
    The Spearmint toothpaste produced by the Spearmint Company is ninety percent foreign language. The instructions on the toothpaste also emphasize that this toothpaste is "made with superior American raw materials." This advertising campaign by the Spearmint Company lacks a spirit of patriotism and is a terrible practice.
              Wu Yanheng
        (II)
    The Samsung toothpaste box states, "Considered a good product by American dental expert Dr. Delpe." I believe this kind of advertising lacks a political stance. Why must Chinese products be advertised by saying they were tested and deemed good by an American expert? Moreover, after the Chinese people have undergone patriotic education through the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign, people will not buy it because it was tested and deemed good by an American expert. On the contrary, people will feel disgusted by this kind of advertising.

  某些货物商标广告缺乏爱国主义精神
  （一）编辑同志：
    留兰香公司出品的留兰香牙膏，百分之九十是用的外国文字，牙膏的说明书上又强调说这种牙膏是“采用美国上等原料”制成。留兰香公司的这种广告宣传，是缺乏爱国主义精神的。而且是一种恶劣作风。
              五延恒
        （二）
    三星牙膏的盒子上写着“经美国牙科专家德尔佩博士试验认为良品”的字样，我认为这种宣传是没有政治立场的，中国的产品为什么一定要用经美国专家试验认为良品来宣传呢？而且当中国人民经过了抗美援朝的爱国主义教育以后，人民并不会因为经美国专家试验认为良品而去购买它，相反的人民对这种宣传会感到一种厌恶。
