　　Conspiracy to Use Spain for Aggression
　  The United States Openly Colludes with Franco
Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd: In order to accelerate the implementation of its war preparation plan in Western Europe, the United States has openly colluded further with the Spanish fascist dictator Franco, preparing to sign a bilateral military agreement between the U.S. and Spain and to pull Franco's Spain into the North Atlantic Group.
    U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Sherman flew to Madrid on July 16th and held three days of talks with Franco, discussing the conclusion of an aggressive military alliance and the United States' acquisition of military bases in Spain. U.S. President Truman stated at a press conference on the 19th: "Due to military considerations and the opinion of the Department of Defense, the United States' policy toward Franco's Spain is in the process of changing." The day before, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson also issued a statement acknowledging that "military authorities unanimously believe that Spain has strategic importance for the overall defense of Western Europe (should read: overall aggression plan)." Therefore, talks with Spain are "the inevitable result" of this conclusion.
    The preliminary results of Sherman's talks with Franco were announced in Madrid on the 18th. The Franco government has formally allowed the United States to use eight major naval and air force bases scattered throughout Spain. According to various sources, Franco requested financial and military assistance from the United States during the negotiations to stabilize his fragile regime. After the negotiations, Franco expressed "extreme satisfaction."
    During Sherman's negotiations with Franco, the Soviet newspaper "Labor" revealed that Eisenhower had recently requested Franco to provide detailed information on Spanish military strength and military industry. The Franco government sent a secret delegation to Paris to meet with Eisenhower at his headquarters. They discussed the issue of Franco's armed forces participating in the North Atlantic aggressive army.
    This open and unbridled move by the United States to utilize Franco has caused some divisions within the imperialist camp. Due to the long-standing and deep-seated hatred of the people of Western Europe for Franco's fascist dictatorship, the ruling groups of these countries are concerned about the United States' blatant policy of utilizing Franco. For this reason, even the British government, which has always shown "friendliness" towards Franco, had to express opposition to Sherman's talks with Franco.
    An Associated Press dispatch on the 16th revealed that "government spokesmen in London and Paris have said that the two countries have notified the United States that they oppose: 1. Spain joining the twelve-nation Atlantic Pact; 2. Spain and any member of the Atlantic Pact concluding a military "alliance"; 3. The United States seeking plans for Spanish naval and air force bases." Despite Acheson's statement on the 18th, attempting to appease the opposition of its Western European followers, on the same day, a British Foreign Office spokesman issued a statement reiterating its opposition to the conclusion of a U.S.-Spanish military agreement. The opposition from the French side has also "not been eliminated by Secretary of State Acheson's assurance that the obligations the United States undertakes under the Atlantic Pact will not be affected" (Agence France-Presse).

### 阴谋利用西班牙进行侵略  美国公开勾结佛朗哥

　　阴谋利用西班牙进行侵略
　  美国公开勾结佛朗哥
    【新华社二十二日讯】为了加紧推行在西欧的备战计划，美国已公开和西班牙法西斯独裁者佛朗哥实行进一步的勾结，准备签订美西两国双边军事协定，并准备把佛朗哥西班牙拉进北大西洋集团中去。
    美国海军作战部部长薛尔曼于七月十六日飞往马德里，和佛朗哥举行了三天会谈，讨论了缔结侵略性的军事联盟和美国取得在西班牙的军事基地问题。美国总统杜鲁门在十九日举行的记者招待会中表示：“由于军事上的考虑和国防部的意见，美国对佛朗哥西班牙的政策正在改变过程中。”在这前一天，美国国务卿艾奇逊也发表声明承认：“军事当局一致认为，西班牙对西欧的总防御（应读作总侵略计划）具有战略上的重要性”。因此，和西班牙进行会谈乃是这一结论的“必然的结果”。
    薛尔曼和佛朗哥会谈的初步结果已于十八日在马德里宣布，佛朗哥政府已正式允许美国使用散布西班牙全国的八个主要的海空军基地。又据各方消息透露，佛朗哥在谈判中曾要求美国给予财政和军事援助，以稳定其脆弱的政权，谈判结束后，佛朗哥曾表示“极感满意”。
    在薛尔曼与佛朗哥的谈判期间，苏联《劳动报》曾著文揭露：最近，艾森豪威尔曾要求佛朗哥提供关于西班牙兵力和军事工业的详细材料。佛朗哥政府曾派遣秘密代表团到巴黎去，和艾森豪威尔在他的总部会了面。他们讨论了佛朗哥武装部队参加北大西洋侵略军的问题。
    美国这种公开地、肆无忌惮地利用佛朗哥的举动，引起了帝国主义阵营内部的某些分歧。由于西欧各国人民长久以来对于佛朗哥法西斯独裁政权的深切痛恨，这些国家的统治集团对美国的明目张胆地利用佛朗哥的政策感到顾虑。由于这种原因，甚至一向对佛朗哥同样表示“友善”的英国政府，也不得不表示反对薛尔曼和佛朗哥的会谈。
    美联社十六日消息透露，“伦敦和巴黎的政府发言人都说：两国已通知美国，它们反对：一、西班牙加入十二国的大西洋公约；二、西班牙和大西洋公约的任何成员国订立军事“联盟”；三、美国谋取西班牙海军和空军基地的计划。”尽管艾奇逊十八日发表了声明，企图平息西欧仆从的反对情绪，但是，就在同一天，英国外交部发言人又发表声明，重申反对美西缔结军事协定的立场。而法国方面的反对情绪，也“并未因国务卿艾奇逊保证美国根据大西洋公约所承担的义务绝不会受到影响而消除”（法新社）。
