The Error Lies in My "Education" Viewpoint
    Dong Weichuan

   (I)
    First, I should explain why I am only making this self-criticism today, as many people, both acquaintances and strangers, are concerned about it.

    I went to Dalian, Lushun, and Shenyang for a tour; the round trip took a month, and I spent a few more days summarizing after returning. Although I read several articles criticizing the "Wu Xun Spirit" during the trip and heard discussions about Wu Xun, I was unable to focus my mind on this issue and had to leave it until after returning to Beijing.

    Secondly, after reading several articles of rebuttal and self-criticism, my thoughts and understanding had no difficulty in transforming, but my emotions were slow to change; suddenly throwing Wu Xun, who I had always regarded as an idol, on the ground and trampling on him was not easy to feel. Before my emotions changed, I did not force myself to write, so I carefully read those articles again and again, and my emotions slowly dropped like a thermometer. This is another reason for the delay of a few days.

   (II)
    Why do I say that my thoughts and understanding were not difficult to transform?

    Ten days ago, I met an old friend in Shenyang. During the conversation, he bluntly said to me: "You were not a very reactionary person in the past." I gladly accepted this comment. Because I held the illusion of being "above politics" and "above class," I ran education for the reactionary ruling class for nearly thirty years, that is, I relied on reactionary forces for nearly thirty years of my life. I once devoted myself to the literacy movement, and at the time I thought I had achieved great success, but its achievements, in addition to powdering the faces of the reactionary ruling class, also cultivated slaves with a certain cultural level for the reactionary ruling class to drive and exploit. I was only teaching illiterates to read and write under the guise of "reformism," and never taught them revolution; if I had taught illiterates to rise up in revolution, the reactionary ruling class would not have allowed me to do this kind of work for a long time. As for being reactionary but not "very," it was only because I did not resist the people's revolution from the front.

    I realized this principle not long after Beijing was liberated, and I repeatedly confessed it in several articles I wrote. Therefore, as soon as someone exposed that Wu Xun's running "free schools" was taking the reactionary ruling class as a backer and serving the reactionary ruling class, and that he himself later climbed up to the reactionary ruling class, I immediately felt a whip heavily striking my back. This principle was something I had already realized, so why did I still admire him and sing his praises, saying he was the "banner of cultural emancipation"? I felt that I could not tolerate this mistake myself!

           (III)
    After the liberation of Beijing, someone held a meeting in a theater to commemorate Wu Xun. They came to my house four or five times beforehand and even called me at the last minute, but I never went, because I estimated that I might be invited to speak on stage, but I didn't know how to evaluate Wu Xun after the times had changed. This was not my being clear-headed, but my avoidance. I didn't put my mind to comparing Wu Xun with the new era because of this matter.

    In February this year, I suddenly received an invitation from Kunlun Film Company to go to the Central Film Bureau to watch "The Story of Wu Xun." This film was shown in Shanghai before it came to Beijing, and it was previewed at the Central Film Bureau, which made me mistakenly believe that this "beggar for righteousness" who ran "free schools" had been affirmed and there was no problem. So I went with a kind of hope, hoping not to portray Wu Xun as Ah Q. And I expected this film to be no more than an hour and a half.

    After arriving, I watched the first part, followed by the second part, for a total of four hours. Then a forum was held. Mr. Sun Yu, who was in charge of directing and writing, was also present.

    I felt extremely dissatisfied with this film, because it was disjointed, with martial arts, gods and monsters, love, education, and... spread out into a "Film Grand View." I felt that this was the result of Shanghai-style style and the purpose of making money. When I was asked to express my opinion, I raised three points: first, there was no need to be so disjointed, and I hoped it could be cut into one reel; second, Wu Xun's fantasy journey to the underworld to spread superstition should be deleted; third, it both praised and denied, making the audience confused.

    Most of the participants in the forum were literary and art workers. Some appreciated the peach blossoms blooming on Xiao Tao's grave as a romantic technique; some said that Xiao Tao was hinting at Mr. Tao Xingzhi. I found these opinions very boring. But there were two opinions: one was that Wu Xun's various actions represented the excellent traditions of the Chinese nation, which could be combined with the new patriotism to educate the next generation; the other was that it should be changed into a small film and promoted in various counties and townships in order to promote the "publicly run and publicly assisted" popular education movement. After hearing this, I not only admired it, but also felt ashamed that I was an educator and had not thought of these things.

    After the forum, someone suggested that everyone write articles and publish them in a special issue in the newspaper. The next day, they called again to urge me. Since I felt that there was educational significance to be developed, and I was dissatisfied with the disjointedness of the film, and added to the fact that I "couldn't refuse the request," I wrote "Evaluating 'The Story of Wu Xun' from an Educational Perspective" that night, and it was taken away on the third day.

    When I was writing it, I considered that it was not appropriate to criticize the film's poor quality at the beginning, so I first praised Wu Xun's educational value in a big way. Not only did I write the two opinions I heard at the forum through my own thoughts, feelings, and language, but I also associated "publicly run and publicly assisted" with "cultural emancipation," and thus complimented him as a "banner."

    It is a fact that my knowledge of Wu Xun was limited to "picture books" and the like. It is also a fact that I did not know about the Taiping Army and Nian Party's actions in western Shandong at that time. However, this is not enough to cover up my mistakes. Before liberation, I had already understood that education should not be viewed in isolation, and I also understood that the "education saves the country theory" and the "education omnipotence theory" could not be established, and after liberation, I also understood that illiteracy was caused by the oppression and exploitation of the reactionary ruling class and imperialism, but when I was writing this article, I did not realize any of this at all. I do not admit that I was confused by something about Wu Xun, it was entirely my own confusion.

           (IV)
    Since I understood certain principles, why was I so confused, and why was the title "Educational Viewpoint"?

    After the People's Liberation Army entered Beijing, two friends who came from the old revolutionary base areas came to see me. They said: "After the May Fourth Movement, you told us about historical materialism, class struggle, etc., which gave us enlightenment education, but your position has always been unstable." Unstable position is the fundamental problem of me as me. In the past two years, although I have tried to transform myself to stand firmly on the people's position, decades of petty-bourgeois life have caused my thoughts, consciousness, speech, and actions to be often confused and contradictory, and sometimes I do not feel that they are confused and contradictory.

    For example, there were several places that made me feel disgusted and question when I watched the movie, but they flashed by. I couldn't bear to see Wu Xun kowtowing to the landlord, but I immediately forgave him for being a peasant who was used to being oppressed. When he knelt down and begged a scholar to help him run the school, I suspected that he was colluding with the "gentry," but I immediately got two answers: one was that this "gentry" was "enlightened," and the other was that he himself had not received education and had to entrust someone "educated." The movie showed that he found that the education students received was "learning is good, then be an official," he frowned and urged "Don't forget we farmers," I saw here and understood that the screenwriter deliberately acquitted Wu Xun, but I immediately thought that this was an inevitable evil result limited by the times and society, not his original intention. (I did not notice the sentence "sons and grandsons sit in eight-carried sedan chairs.") When I read "The world is so thin, the mainland is sinking," I felt that it was the tone of a village school teacher decades ago, but I also muddled through. ...All of this shows the instability of my position.

    When Zhou Da and Wu Xun broke up, I told a person next to me: "This is the difference between reformism and revolution." In fact, none of Wu Xun's things deserve to be called reformism. As for Zhou Da, although I felt happy when he burned the landlord's house, one was because I thought this was fabricated by the editor to lengthen the film, and the other was because those bandit-like scenes of coming and going did not make me feel "revolutionary." For this reason, I still focused on Wu Xun. In fact, I mistakenly regarded Wu Xun as a reformist and praised him indiscriminately, or my old consciousness of "above politics" and "above class" was unconsciously at work, or because I was afraid of serious practical struggle and relied on the petty bourgeoisie who had been in power for decades, using Wu Xun's "success" to once again make a "reformist" intoxication and propaganda.

    Therefore, when I wrote that article with an "education" viewpoint, I had to distinguish Wu Xun from "The Story of Wu Xun," and I had to distinguish Wu Xun's ugly deeds from his "righteous deeds." As a result, it must be an abstract, supra-class, and blind view of education!

    To use an analogy: a person who has suffered from lung disease for many years, after two years of treatment, the local (can only be said to be local) germs have stopped moving, but once encountering the flu, the old disease immediately relapses. This is not to blame the flu, only to blame yourself for not having enough medical skills, so that you are confused and paralyzed, unaware of prevention and vigilance!

           (V)
    The manuscript was taken away without seeing it a second time (this is of course my own fault for not being serious), and I was very worried. What I was worried about was not complimenting Wu Xun, but criticizing the screenwriter's historical view of both praising and denying.

    A day later, the person who took the manuscript telegraphed: the editor of the newspaper wanted to discuss it with me. In order to be at ease, I prepared to add a sentence at the end when the manuscript was returned: "How to deal with this historical figure should be decided by the Party Central Committee and the Ministry of Education." But the newspaper published it without anyone coming to discuss it. In fact, adding this sentence would be useless, but it only shows my worry here.

    Although I was worried, not long after it was published, I received a letter from a friend in Jinan, expressing deep appreciation. He said: "Reading the review of 'The Story of Wu Xun,' I deeply feel that your theoretical level has improved. You dare to not avoid the suspicion of supporting reformism, which is precisely where your progress lies, and it is precisely because you have worked hard on dialectics. I think that reformism, which originates from the ruling class, is indeed a paralyzing means to ease class struggle. If it originates from the oppressed class, it is the enlightenment movement of the revolution. The historical facts of the workers' movement also started from fighting for wages and working hours, and then moved on to fighting for political power, changing from 'free class' to 'self-conscious class.' In different countries, Sun Yat-sen in semi-colonial countries and the Fabian Society's gentlemen in the British Empire should not be mentioned in the same breath. Many non-historical and non-dialectical superficial speculative works need people who can write to expose them mercilessly. This article, I think, is a relatively mature one in your writing after liberation." Because I was worried about what I wrote, I have not replied to this letter until today. I don't know if this friend has read "Wu Xun, the Man and His Deeds," and understood what "class" Wu Xun represents, and whether the road Wu Xun took is "reformism," etc., will his views change?

    My article is one of the powerful works praising Wu Xun, and its impact, like this friend in Jinan, is unknown how many people!

    In the past month, I saw that in the Dalian and Lushun areas, after liberation, after the land reform, and with the help of Soviet friends, the economy has been restored, consolidated, and developed, and the foundation for industrialization has been rapidly laid. Therefore, there are conditions and needs for popularizing education; as a result, not only children over the age of seven have entered school, but also 30% of adult illiterates have been basically eliminated within two years. The work of eliminating illiteracy is under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, mobilizing a large number of mass teachers, actively responsible, and overcoming all difficulties to succeed. One night, our tour group watched fifteen classes at the same time. I saw forty-odd housewives learning a lesson on "Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries" in an hour and a half. Their reading and comprehension ability has reached the level of high elementary school, and this achievement is really admirable and pleasant. Some mass teachers can patiently teach dumb people to read; some deliver homework to students from house to house during typhoons. These teachers are working hard with revolutionary enthusiasm and class friendship under a high degree of political consciousness, which is the exact opposite of the "miracle" of the "Wu Xun Spirit" in essence. And because Dalian and Lushun have become advanced areas in all aspects, it also proves that so-called "reformism" is a fantasy. Based on the lessons of these facts alone, I have realized the absurdity of praising Wu Xun!

           (VI)
    In the past, since I thought of myself as a "reformist" but was actually a person attached to the reactionary ruling class, during the period of transformation, I boldly praised the person who surrendered to the reactionary ruling class due to my own confusion, paralysis, and lack of vigilance, blurring the awareness of class struggle and reducing and corroding the cultural and political fighting power of the masses. There is no doubt that I have committed a serious mistake of confusing the enemy and ourselves. What's more, I am an educator, and I used the "education" viewpoint, and it is not "inevitable and natural" to be whipped heavily?

    Someone said before that Dewey can put on the coat of Marx, and now it proves that Wu Xun can also put on the coat of Marx. It can be seen that all feudal, comprador, and fascist things can be disguised as Marx and mixed into the revolutionary camp, weakening the strength of the revolution.

    I heard that some people complain a lot because they were whipped. I think that as long as a person is willing to objectively compare the road he has traveled with the road of the Chinese revolution ("Thirty Years of the Chinese Communist Party"), he will turn his complaints into nothing and feel fortunate to be whipped. If I hadn't written that article, in this movement of criticizing Wu Xun, although I would have been whipped invisibly, I wouldn't have felt such hot pain, and I wouldn't have stroked this scar when it rained and the wind blew.

    The class viewpoint is the key to solving all problems, and this is the principle I have already understood. However, this key is often put in the pocket and forgotten to use, and it is often misused. Letting Wu Xun put on the coat of Marx is one of the results of misuse. The reason, of course, is that I don't really understand what class viewpoint is.

    Therefore, I not only need to read more political theory books, but also need to exercise myself in practice and among the masses, so that my thoughts, consciousness, life, and actions can be gradually improved from correctness. (As for why the emotions change relatively slowly, it is still the petty-bourgeois sentimentality that is at work.)

    I am eager for everyone's guidance on my self-criticism! I am willing to make a second, third, ... self-criticism.

### 错误在于我的“教育”观点

　　错误在于我的“教育”观点
    董渭川
   （一）
    首先我应该说明，为什么迟到今天我才作这篇检讨，因为这是好些识与不识的人所关心的。
    我到大连、旅顺、沈阳等地参观去了；往返一个月，回来又作了几天总结。虽然在旅途中读过几篇批判“武训精神”的文章，也听到过关于武训的谈论，但未能把心思专注在这个问题上，只好留待回北京以后。
    其次是，在读了若干篇驳斥与检讨的文章之后，我的思想、认识没有什么难转变的地方，转变得慢的是我的感情；把一向当作偶像的武训，忽然扔在地上，用脚践踏一番，还不易有此感情。在感情未变之前，我不勉强动笔，于是再一篇一篇地仔细读那些文章，感情才像温度计似地缓缓下降。这又是推延了几天的原因。
   （二）
    为什么说我的思想、认识不难转变呢？
    十天前在沈阳遇到一个旧友，谈话中间，他率直地对我说：“你过去是一个不很反动的人。”我欣然接受了他这个评语。因为我抱着“超政治”、“超阶级”的幻想，给反动统治阶级办了近乎三十年的教育，也就是依靠反动势力生活了近乎三十年。我曾经致力于扫除文盲运动，在当时自以为满有成绩，而其成绩，除给反动统治阶级搽粉之外，更为反动统治阶级培养具备一定文化水平可供驱使、供剥削的奴隶。我只是打着“改良主义”的幌子教文盲识字读书，而从未教他们革命；假如教文盲起来革命，反动统治阶级也就不允许我长期干这种工作了。至于反动而不“很”，就在于我未从正面抗拒人民的革命，如此而已。
    这道理，在北京解放之后不久，我就恍然了，并且在我写的几篇文章中一再作过自诉了。所以一经有人揭穿了武训的办“义学”是拿反动统治阶级作靠山，为反动统治阶级服务，并且他自己到后来也爬上了反动统治阶级，使我立即感到有一条皮鞭重重地打在我的背上。这道理是我已经觉悟了的，为什么我还那样崇拜他、歌颂他，说他是“文化翻身的旗帜”呢？我对于我自己也感到是不能容忍的过失了！
            （三）
    北京解放后，曾经有人在一家剧院里开会纪念武训，事前来我家四、五次，临时还打电话找我，而我始终未去，因为我估计有被邀登台讲话的可能，可是我不知道在时代变了之后，对于武训这个人应如何估价。这并非我的清醒，而是我的躲避。我并未因这件事而用心思把武训和新时代作一对照。
    今年二月，忽然接到昆仑影片公司一份请柬，约到中央电影局去看《武训传》。这个片子是在上海演过才到北京的，并且是在中央电影局预演，使我误认为这个办“义学”的“义丐”已被肯定而无问题了。于是我抱着一种希望前去，希望不要把武训演成阿Ｑ。并且我预料这部片子不过演一个半小时。
    走到之后，看完上集，继以下集，一共四小时之久。接着举行座谈。负编导之责的孙瑜先生也在场。
    我对于这部片子感到极大的不满，因为东拉西扯，有武侠、有神怪、有爱情、有教育、有……铺张成一部《电影大观》了。我感到这是海派作风与赚钱目的的结果。要我表示意见时，我提了三点：一是不必如此铺张，希望剪裁为一卷；二是武训的幻游地府，传播迷信，应该删去；三是既表扬之而又否定之，使观者莫明其妙。
    参加座谈的人，大部分是文艺工作者。有人欣赏小桃坟上开出桃花，是浪漫手法；有人说小桃在暗示陶行知先生。这些意见，我听着很无聊。但有两种意见：一是武训的种种代表着中华民族的优良传统，正好与新爱国主义结合起来，用以教育下一代；又一是应该改制为小片，到各县各乡去宣传，以便推进“民办公助”的普及教育运动。我听了之后，不光佩服，并且惭愧自己是一个教育工作者而想不到这些。
    座谈散后，有人提议请大家写文章，在报上出专刊。第二天又打电话来催。我既觉得有教育意义可以发挥，而又对影片的东拉西扯不满，再加上“情不可却”，于是在那天晚上写成了“从教育观点评武训传”，第三天就被拿走。
    在写的当时，我考虑着一开始就批评影片的糟糕，不太合宜，就先把武训的教育价值大事颂扬。不光把在座谈会上听到的那两种意见通过我自己的思想、感情和语言写进去，并且由“民办公助”联想到“文化翻身”，于是乎把他恭维成一个“旗帜”了。
    我对于武训的知识，仅限于“画传”之类，是事实。我不知道那时鲁西一带有太平军和捻党的行动，也是事实。然而这并不足以掩饰我的错误。在解放之前，我已懂得了不应该孤立起来看教育，也懂得了“教育救国论”和“教育万能论”的不能成立，并且在解放后，也明白了文盲是由反动统治阶级和帝国主义的压迫、剥削造成的，但是在写这篇东西时，竟然丝毫没意识到这些。我不承认是被武训的什么所迷惑，完全是我自己的糊涂。
            （四）
    既然明白了某些道理，为什么又这样糊涂，而且标题为“教育观点”呢？
    解放军进入北京城之后，曾经有两个从老区来的朋友来看我。他们说：“在五四运动之后，你给我们讲唯物史观，阶级斗争等等，使我们受到了启蒙的教育，但是你的立场一直是不稳的。”立场不稳，正是我之为我的根本问题。两年来，我虽企图把自己改造到站稳人民的立场，但几十年的小资产阶级生活，使我自思想意识以至于言论行动，时常由混乱而矛盾，并且有时自己感觉不到是混乱矛盾。
    举例说吧，在看电影的当时，很有几处使我起反感、生疑问，但一闪就过去了。武训对地主磕头，我看不下去，而我马上原谅他是一个受压迫惯了的农民。他跪求一个举人帮他办学时，我曾怀疑他去和“士绅”勾结，但立即得到两个解答：一为这个“士绅”是“开明”的，又一为他自己既未受过教育，只好委托“有学问”的人了。电影中显示他发见学生受的教育是“学而优则仕”，他愁眉苦脸地叮嘱“不要忘了咱庄稼人”，我看到这里，明白是编剧者故意替武训开脱，但又立即认为这是时代社会所限制的无可避免的恶果，并非他的本意。（我并未注意到“子子孙孙坐八抬大轿”那句话。）当我读到“世风何薄，大陆日沉”时，曾感到是几十年前的三家村私塾先生口气，但也马虎过去了。……类此种种，都说明我的立场之不稳。
    当周大和武训分手时，我告诉邻座的一位说：“这是改良主义与革命的分歧。”其实武训的一切，又何尝配称为改良主义呢？对于周大，虽然在他火烧地主的房子时，我感到痛快，但是一因我认定这是编者为把影片拖长而虚构的，二因那些响马式的忽来忽去的场面，并未使我起“革命”之感。以此之故，我还是把重点放在武训身上。其实呢，我把武训误认作改良主义者，而不顾一切地大捧特捧他，还是我的“超政治”“超阶级”的旧意识在不知不觉中作祟，还是因为畏惧严重的实践斗争而依靠了反动统治几十年的小资产阶级，借武训的“功成名就”，而再一次作“改良主义”的陶醉与宣传。
    所以在我抱着“教育”观点写那篇东西时，既要把武训和《武训传》区别开来，又要把武训的那些丑行和“义行”区别开来。其结果，自必然是抽象的、超阶级的、盲目的教育观了！
    打个比喻来说：一个患了多年肺病的人，经过两年的医治，局部的（只能说是局部）病菌已停止活动，但一遇到流行性感冒，立即旧病复发。这并不怪流行性感冒，只有怪自己医疗的功夫不够，以至于糊涂麻痹，不知防范与警惕！
            （五）
    稿子未看第二遍就被拿走（这当然怪自己不认真），很有些不放心。所不放心的，并不在于恭维武训，而在于批评编者既表扬之而又否定之那段历史观。
    隔了一天，取稿子的人电告：报社的编者要和我商量一下。为求放心起见，我准备稿子拿回来时，在最后加一句：“对于这个历史人物究应如何处理，应该请党中央和教育部决定。”可是报社未来人商量就发表了。其实加上这一句也无用，不过在这里说明我的不放心而已。
    尽管我不放心，发表不久，就接到济南一个朋友来信，深致赞许。他说：“读评《武训传》，深感你的理论水平提高。你敢于不避支持改良主义之嫌，正是你的进步的所在，正是你对辩证法下了功夫。我认为改良主义倡自统治阶级，的确是缓和阶级斗争的麻痹手段，若倡自被压迫阶级，正是革命的启蒙运动。工人运动的史实，也是由争工资，争工时，才进而争政权，由“自在阶级”变为“自为阶级”。以不同的国家而论，半殖民地的孙中山和大英帝国费边社的先生们，断不可同年而语。许多非历史的、非辩证的肤浅投机作品，正需要能写作的人予以无情的揭发。这篇文，我认为是解放后你的写作中比较成熟的一篇。”因为我对于自己所写不放心，直到今天未回复他这封信。不知道这位朋友读了“武训其人其事”，和明白了武训究竟代表的是什么‘阶级’”，以及武训走的路是否“改良主义”等等之后，看法有无改变？
    我这篇东西是歌颂武训的力作之一，影响所及，像济南这位朋友，正不知有多少人！
    在过去的一个月中，看见旅大地区在解放之后，在土地改革之后，在苏联友人的帮助下，经济由恢复而巩固而发展，迅速地奠定了工业化的基础，因之，普及教育有了条件，有了需要；于是乎不仅七岁以上的儿童都入了学，并且占百分之三十的成年文盲在两年之内也基本上肃清了。肃清文盲的工作，是在党和人民政府领导下，动员了大批的群众教师，积极负责，克服一切困难而成功的。有一天晚上，我们参观团同时看了十五个班。我看见四十几位家庭妇女，于一小时半之内，学习了一课“镇压反革命”，她们的阅读与理解能力已达到了高小的水平，这成绩实在令人钦佩愉快。有的群众教师，能耐心地教会哑吧识字；有的在台风时期，挨家挨户给学生送作业。这些教师是在高度的政治觉悟下，本着革命的热情与阶级的友爱而努力的，在本质上是和“武训精神”的“奇迹”恰恰相反的。并且由于旅大在各方面之成为先进地区，也证明所谓“改良主义”是幻想。单凭这些事实的教训，已使我体会到歌颂武训之荒谬了！
            （六）
    过去既然自以为“改良主义”者而实质上是依附反动统治阶级的人，在改造的期间，复因自己的糊涂、麻痹、不警惕，大胆地歌颂向反动统治阶级投降的人，模糊阶级斗争的意识，减低和腐蚀群众的文化和政治上的战斗力，这无疑问地是犯了混淆敌我的严重过失。何况我是一个教育工作者，而又用的是“教育”观点，重重地挨一皮鞭，不正是“势有必至，理有固然”吗？
    以前有人说，杜威可以穿上马克思的外套，现在证明武训也可以穿上马克思的外套。由此可见，一切封建的、买办的、法西斯的东西都可以伪装成马克思，混在革命的阵营里，削弱革命的力量。
    听说有的人因挨了皮鞭而大发牢骚。我想，一个人只要肯把自己走过的道路和中国革命的道路（“中国共产党的三十年”）客观地作一对照，也就会把牢骚化归乌有，而为挨这一鞭感到庆幸了。我如果没写那篇东西，在批判武训的这一运动中，虽然也在无形中挨到皮鞭，却不会感觉如此火热的疼痛，更不会在下雨刮风的时候，抚摩一下这条伤痕。
    阶级观点是解决一切问题的钥匙，这是我已经晓得了的道理。但是，这把钥匙，常放在口袋里忘记用它，也常误用它。让武训披上马克思的外套，就是误用的结果之一。原因当然是并不真懂得什么叫阶级观点。
    因此，我不光需要多读政治理论书籍，更需要在实践中，群众中锻炼自己，使自己的思想意识生活行动，由正确而逐步提高。（至于感情之所以变得比较慢，也还是小资产阶级的温情主义在作祟。）
    我在渴望着大家对于我这篇检讨的指教！我愿作第二次、第三次、……的再检讨。
                                   （原载《光明日报》）
