Xinhua News Agency, July 27th: Following the arrival of the U.S. Fourth Infantry Division in West Germany in June, the U.S. government has dispatched the Second Armored Division to West Germany, with its first batch of troops landing in Bremerhaven on July 13th. U.S. imperialism is turning West Germany into a training ground for the U.S. Army, inheriting the mantle of the Hitler bandit army on the spot. Associated Press reporter Omar Maree revealed: The U.S. occupation forces in West Germany are "engaging in training as much as possible in actual battlefield conditions," and "combat team training is being intensified." "In some respects, they are taking teaching materials from the German Wehrmacht textbooks." Omar Maree shamelessly admitted that the U.S. troops stationed in Germany are no longer the so-called "occupation forces" but have become invading forces. He said: "The occupation mission of the U.S. Army actually ended in 1948. Amidst the intensification of the Cold War against the Soviet Union, every occupying soldier has become a possible Western defender (should be read as an aggressor against the East), so his training has also changed."

The U.S. occupying authorities are massively seizing civilian houses and farmland of the West German people to be used as barracks, training grounds, and military bases. In Bavaria alone, by the beginning of June this year, the U.S. authorities had requisitioned 107,000 civilian houses, and another 1,200 dormitories will be needed within the year to accommodate the new U.S. troops. The U.S. military recently decided to expand the Hammelburg training camp tenfold, which will affect 21,000 Germans. The residents of seven villages will be evicted, and the residents of another seven villages will almost lose all their land, most of which is fertile farmland. With the arrival of the Second Armored Division, nearly 100 hectares of farmland between Würzburg and Schweinfurt have been designated as training grounds for this unit.

The U.S. military's methods are extremely brutal when seizing the land of West German farmers. In the village of Sembach in the Palatinate, in order to occupy the farmland there to build a military airport, the U.S. military sent military patrols there, poured gasoline on the ripe grain, and set fire to burn the grain. This barbaric act of the American occupiers has aroused the unparalleled anger of the local people. The village head of Sembach issued a letter to the entire German people saying: "Our land is being sacrificed for the preparation of another war. If we do not resolutely and unitedly come out to save our motherland, then first the grain will be burned, and then the cities and villages will be burned."

　　美续增兵西德加紧训练
　  蛮横侵占民房焚烧谷物
    【新华社二十七日讯】继美国第四步兵师于六月间开至西德以后，美国政府又派遣第二装甲师开赴西德，其首批部队已于七月十三日在不来梅港登陆。美帝国主义正把西德作为训练美国陆军的场所，以就地承袭希特勒匪军的衣钵。美联社记者奥玛雷透露：美国占领军在西德“尽量以实际战场情况来从事训练”，“战斗队的训练正在加紧进行中”。“在某些方面，他们正在从德国国防军教本中取得教材”。奥玛雷公然无耻地承认驻德美军现在已不是所谓“占领军”而成了侵略军。他说：“美国陆军的占领任务实际上在一九四八年就已经结束，在对苏冷战加紧声中，每个占领士兵都已成为可能的西方保卫者（应读为对东方的侵略者），因而他的训练也改变了。”
    美国占领当局大量侵占西德人民的民房和耕地，作为兵营、练兵场和军事基地。单在巴伐利亚州，美国当局到今年六月初就已征用了民房十万七千所，年内还另外需要征用一千二百处宿舍，以供美军新部队居住。美军最近决定把汉麦尔堡的练兵营扩大十倍，这就要使二万一千名德国人受到影响，七个村庄的居民将被逐出，另有七个村庄的居民差不多将丧失他们的全部土地，其中大部分都是肥沃的耕地。随着第二装甲师的到达，在威斯堡和什温福特间又有几达一百公顷的耕地，被辟为这支部队的演习场所。
    美军在侵占西德农民的土地时，手段蛮横已极。在法尔兹的森巴赫村，美军为了要占领那里的耕地来建筑军用飞机场，竟把军事巡逻队开到那里，把石油精倒在成熟的谷物上，放火把这些谷物烧掉。美国占领者的这种野蛮行动，已激起当地人民的无比愤怒。森巴赫村的村长发表告全德国人民书说：“我们的土地因准备另一次战争而受到牺牲。如果我们不坚决一致地出来挽救我们的祖国，那么，首先是谷物被焚毁，随后就将是城市和村庄被焚毁了。”
