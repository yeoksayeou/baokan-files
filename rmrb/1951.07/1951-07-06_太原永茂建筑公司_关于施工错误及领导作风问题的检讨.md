A Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

　　Taiyuan Yongmao Construction Company
    Self-Criticism Regarding Construction Errors and Leadership Style Problems
To the Editors:
    In the People's Daily's Reader's Letters column on April 30th, Comrade Zhang Jingguang published criticism of our work style. We convened a meeting to conduct a self-criticism in response to this.
    In terms of engineering, our thinking did not rely on the workers, but on feudal foremen. Furthermore, due to our lax inspection during construction, inadequate management, and insufficient work on anti-freeze stove fire measures, the indoor temperature fluctuated greatly, causing partial freezing and cracking of the cement floor, partial falling of the grey ceiling, and freezing and bursting of water pipes. Although we repaired this before handover, it caused losses to the state in terms of manpower and resources.
    In the wage system, there are still remnants of feudal exploitation, such as paying wages to the foremen. For example, foreman Sun Jie contracted the project from the company and subcontracted it to Zhao Chunyou. Although this project was handled on a delegated basis, the company handed it over to the feudal foreman Sun Jie, who then subcontracted it to the workers, exploiting them in the process. The company should bear responsibility for this. This was also caused by our failure to establish the idea of relying on the masses of workers. After self-criticism, the wage payment procedure has been changed this year to direct payment to the workers.
    In terms of work style, we still retain bad habits from the old society, such as hosting dinners and attending operas, and extravagance and waste, which are unacceptable for personnel of state-owned enterprises. We are vigilant and will ensure that similar incidents do not happen again in the future.
                                           Taiyuan Yongmao Construction Company
    Editor's Note: Taiyuan Yongmao Construction Company has made a preliminary self-criticism regarding the construction errors, which is necessary.
    We have received readers' letters criticizing the company's work more than once, and we hope that the company can conduct a more thorough self-criticism of the errors that have occurred in order to improve its work.

### 太原永茂建筑公司   关于施工错误及领导作风问题的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　太原永茂建筑公司 
    关于施工错误及领导作风问题的检讨编辑同志：
    四月三十日人民日报读者来信栏内，刊登张敬光同志对我们作风问题的批评。对此，我们曾开会进行了检讨。
    在工程方面，我们思想上没有依靠工人，而是依靠封建把头。又因我们在施工中检查不严，管理不周，对防冻炉火工作做的不够，室内温度忽高忽低、致使洋灰地发生部分冻裂，及灰顶棚部分掉落，水管冻结、跑水等现象。我们虽在交工前修理了，但已使国家人力财力受到损失。
    工资制度上，还存在残余封建剥削，发工资时还是发给把头。例如把头孙杰将工程从公司接手转包给赵春有，此工程虽系代办，但公司交给了封建把头孙杰，孙又转包给工人，从中剥削，公司应负责任的。这也是由于我们没有建立起依靠工人群众的思想而产生的。经过检讨，今年已将发工资手续改为直接发给工人。
    在作风方面，我们仍残留有旧社会恶习，如请客看戏、铺张浪费，这是公营企业人员所不应有的。并警惕今后不再有类似事情。
                                           太原永茂建筑公司
    编者按：太原永茂建筑公司关于施工的错误，已经作了初步的检讨，这是必要的。
    我们曾不止一次地接到读者来信批评该公司的工作，希望该公司能更深刻地检讨所发生的错误，以改进自己的工作。
