  Hangzhou China Children's Bookstore Deceives the Masses, Selling Old and Reactionary Books as New
  Editor:
    Our school recently, in order to find pattern materials, saw in the September and November 1950 new book bulletins of the Hangzhou China Children's Bookstore a listing for "Elementary Applied Patterns" compiled by Chen Yigui, which was prominently displayed in the November new book bulletin. We went to buy four copies, and as a result, we were deceived. This book is not a new book at all, but a reactionary old book published in "January of the 38th year of the Republic of China" [1949]. It contains reactionary slogans from the Kuomintang ruling era: "Practice propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame; be responsible, observe discipline," "Implement the New Life Movement," as well as reactionary symbols and pattern drawings such as "Boy Scout Group," "New Life," "Boy Scouts," "Zhongzheng Elementary School," and "National Elementary School." These are just the most obvious errors in the book; there are many other problematic areas. The store not only did not stop selling this kind of old book with serious errors, but also used advertising techniques to carry out deceptive promotion on a large scale, which is very inappropriate. We hope that the local authorities in charge will investigate, and the store should also conduct a thorough review.

### 杭州中国儿童书店欺骗群众　把旧的反动书籍当新书卖

  　杭州中国儿童书店欺骗群众
  　把旧的反动书籍当新书卖编辑同志：
    我校最近为了找寻图案资料，看到杭州中国儿童书店一九五○年九月份和十一月份的新书简报上载有陈一揆编的《小学应用图案》的书目，十一月份的新书简报又用大字标出。我们就去买了四本，结果是受骗了。这本书并不是什么新书，而是“民国三十八年一月”出版的反动的旧书。其中有国民党统治时代的反动标语：“明礼义，知廉耻，负责任，守纪律”，“实行新生活”，以及“童子军团”，“新生活”，“童子军”，“中正小学”，“国民小学”等反动的标记和图案画。这些不过是书中最显明的错误，其他有问题的地方还很多。该店对于这种有严重错误的旧书，不但不停止发售，反而运用广告术大作欺骗宣传，是很不应该的。希望当地主管机关予以查究，该店亦应作深刻的检讨。
