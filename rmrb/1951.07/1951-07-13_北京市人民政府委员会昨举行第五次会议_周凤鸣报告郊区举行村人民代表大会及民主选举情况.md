　　【Beijing News Agency Dispatch】The Beijing Municipal People's Government Committee held its fifth meeting yesterday (the 12th), presided over by Mayor Peng Zhen.

　　Zhou Fengming, Deputy Director of the Suburban Work Committee of the Municipal People's Government, first reported on the election of village people's governments in the suburbs. So far, 85 administrative villages in the suburbs have held village people's congresses, electing village chiefs, deputy village chiefs, and members of the village people's government. In his report, Deputy Director Zhou explained that the people's eyes are sharp, and in the elections, some cadres who violated the law, neglected their duties, had poor work styles, and were unfair in handling affairs were not re-elected. Since the democratic elections in each village and the election of new village people's governments, the relationship between the government and the masses has become closer, and with the lead and help of the representatives and village people's government cadres, various tasks have been greatly promoted. Next, Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu reported on the second session of the third Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Conference. Deputy Mayor Zhang said that this conference of people's representatives from all walks of life not only praised the work of the Municipal People's Government, but also criticized shortcomings in certain areas of work, and put forward specific suggestions. The Municipal People's Government attaches great importance to these criticisms and promptly convened an administrative meeting. The meeting unanimously agreed that the relevant departments should study methods and conduct inspections. If the criticisms are correct, they should be accepted and the work should be improved; if the criticisms are inconsistent with the facts, they should be studied and explained; if there are areas that have not been criticized, they should also be carefully inspected. Regarding the proposals of this conference of people's representatives, the Secretariat and the Research Office of the Municipal Government should study them with the relevant units, and propose treatment opinions according to what should be done and can be done, what should be done but must be postponed, and what cannot be done. The government committee members present unanimously agreed with Deputy Mayor Zhang's report. At the meeting, the additional budget for municipal construction, cultural and educational undertakings, and other undertakings for this year, as well as several personnel appointments and removals, were also approved.
