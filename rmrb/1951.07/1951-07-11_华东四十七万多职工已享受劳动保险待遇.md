　　Over 470,000 workers in East China have enjoyed labor insurance benefits. Over 477,000 workers in 1,006 factories and mines in East China have enjoyed labor insurance benefits. The production enthusiasm of the vast number of workers is increasing day by day. Many skilled and experienced workers, having been relieved of worries about birth, old age, sickness, death, injury, and disability, are actively teaching their skills to others. Eight retired workers at the Qingdao Brewery, all elderly workers over seventy years old who suffered under the oppression of German, Japanese, and American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, have expressed their intention to contribute all their skills. Wang Peixian, an old worker with over 30 years of service at the factory, is very familiar with the direction and location of the sewer pipes built during various renovations. Since the blueprints for these projects have mostly been lost, repairs have always relied on his observations. In the past, he often said, "This is my means of survival," and was unwilling to share information about the pipes with others. This time, after enjoying retirement benefits, he spent several days telling other workers about the routes of all the water pipes and sewers. He said, "Otherwise, I would be letting Chairman Mao down!" Zhou Zhongsong, a master brewer in the brewing department, patiently shared his decades of brewing experience with young workers and donated a reference book he had cherished for many years to the trade union. Lu Shanmao, a master worker at the Nanjing Machine Factory, proactively proposed to teach his apprentice the techniques and operating methods stipulated in the six-month apprenticeship contract in just three months.

　　华东四十七万多职工已享受劳动保险待遇
    华东区已有一千零六家厂矿的四十七万七千多个职工享受劳动保险待遇。广大职工生产热情日益提高。很多有技术有经验的工人，在解除了对生、老、病、死、伤、残的顾虑后，都积极地把技术教给别人。青岛啤酒厂八个享受养老待遇的职工，都是饱受德、日、美帝国主义及国民党反动派压迫的七十岁以上的老工人。他们都表示要把全部技术拿出来。有三十多年厂龄的老职工王沛贤，对厂里历次修建的下水道水管的方向和位置，都很熟悉；由于这些工程的蓝图已大都散失，每次都靠他观测修理。过去他常说：“这就是我的求生法宝。”因而不肯把水管情况告诉别人，这次他享受了退休养老待遇后，花了好几天功夫，把所有水管水道的路线，都告诉了其他工人。他说：“不然，太对不起毛主席了！”该厂酿造科老师傅周忠松，把积累了几十年的酿啤酒的经验耐心地讲给青年工人们听，并将珍藏多年的一本参考书献给了工会。南京机器厂老师傅陆山毛，主动提出要把六个月师徒合同中规定的技术和操作方法在三个月内就教给徒弟。
