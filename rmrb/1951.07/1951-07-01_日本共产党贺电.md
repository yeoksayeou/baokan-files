Telegram of Congratulations from the Japanese Communist Party to Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China:

　　On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, we express our heartfelt congratulations.

　　The Communist Party of China has liberated the Chinese people, is building a new China, and is now leading the struggle to crush American imperialist aggression in Korea. In fulfilling this great mission under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the Communist Party of China has demonstrated a brilliant example of the national liberation struggle of colonies and dependent countries. The Japanese Communist Party, which is advancing to complete the national liberation and democratic revolution of Japan, feels particularly excited on this occasion.
                     Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party
                                  June 28, 1951

　　日本共产党贺电中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东同志：
    当中国共产党创立三十周年之际，我们衷心地表示祝贺之忱。
    中国共产党解放了中国人民，建设着新的中国，现在更在朝鲜领导着为粉碎美帝国主义侵略而进行的斗争。中国共产党在毛泽东同志领导下实现这一伟大使命时，表现了殖民地、附属国民族解放斗争的光辉范例。为完成日本民族解放与民主革命而迈进的日本共产党，际此特别感觉兴奋。
                     日本共产党中央委员会
                                  一九五一年六月二十八日
