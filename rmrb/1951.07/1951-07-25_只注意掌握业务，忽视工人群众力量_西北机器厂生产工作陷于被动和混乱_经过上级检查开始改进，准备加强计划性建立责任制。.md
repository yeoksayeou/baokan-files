　　Only Focusing on Mastering Business, Neglecting the Strength of the Worker Masses
　　Northwest Machine Factory's Production Work Falls into Passivity and Chaos
　　After Inspection by Higher Authorities, Improvements Begin, Preparing to Strengthen Planning and Establish a Responsibility System.
　　Northwest Machine Factory's administrative cadres do not rely on the trade union, do not value workers' rationalization proposals, and do not organize the labor force well, causing production to fall completely into passivity and chaos. Only recently, with the assistance of the Northwest Financial and Economic Committee, the Northwest Federation of Trade Unions, and the Northwest Industrial Department's working group for inspection and improvement, has production gradually improved.
　　This year, the factory formulated a full-year monthly production schedule and submitted it to the employees for discussion. However, because this plan was too general, it did not further assist the workshops in determining the specific plan for the order of construction of various machine parts based on the machine equipment and labor allocation. The employees felt it was too vague during the discussion and could not formulate specific group and individual plans, making it impossible to grasp during implementation. In production, due to a lack of in-depth inspection and statistical work, those from above to below did not understand the true production situation, causing serious chaos and disconnections in the production of various workshops. For example, according to the production task, the planer group had a lot of work, and the original plan could not be completed without working three shifts. However, due to the supply of castings not keeping up, only a single shift was worked until April 20th.
　　The phenomenon of no one being responsible in the factory's production exists everywhere. The main ones are: First, no one is responsible for technical issues. Casting rejection is a very serious problem in the factory's production, but no one is specifically responsible for organizing research and solutions, wasting a lot of labor and materials. From December last year to February this year, a batch of large gears and burr rollers were cast, wasting 175 workdays due to rejection. For example, of the 99 cover strips cast in a small furnace on May 8th, 78 were rejected. Second, no one is responsible for pattern storage. Thousands of patterns are not classified and are placed haphazardly in the warehouse. When casting certain cotton gin parts, some patterns took a long time to find, and some had to be remade by the carpentry shop because they could not be found temporarily. However, after they were made, the original patterns were found, wasting labor and materials. Third, no one is responsible for production equipment. This year's production task cannot be completed even with three shifts because there are too few planers. However, a planer allocated to the factory could not be used because it was missing some parts, and no one seriously urged its repair. The boiler in use collapsed due to water shortage in February because the furnace workers lacked experience and no one was responsible for inspection and guidance, causing great losses and almost leading to an explosion.
　　The main reasons for the above-mentioned serious phenomena of chaos, disconnection, and no one being responsible in production are that the factory's administrative leaders lack a highly responsible spirit for the people's cause and have not fully promoted democracy in their work, not valuing mass opinions; procrastination and sluggishness, unable to actively and timely handle work.
　　Administrative leaders do not value workers' opinions. The trade union and the masses are very concerned about the chaos and disconnection in production, and they have come up with various methods to suggest that the administration find ways to overcome them. For example, when discussing the full-year monthly production schedule, the trade union repeatedly requested that the plan be made more specific, but the administration emphasized objective difficulties and did not pay attention to it. In April, worker Zhang Qinghua submitted a written proposal to the factory management committee, requesting that a dedicated person be responsible for inspecting and urging the production of each workshop to reduce the chaos, disconnection, and no one being responsible. However, the administrative leaders dismissed it with the excuse of not being able to spare anyone. For example, the systems of inspection standards, tool management, performance assessment, pattern box management, monthly assessment, and construction were decided to be established quickly at the factory management committee at the end of December last year, and the methods and clauses were drafted in January this year. However, they are still lying on the desk and have not been organized for workers to discuss and implement, resulting in the masses believing that the factory management committee cannot solve problems and are unwilling to offer more opinions.
　　Administrative leaders do not seriously help and promote the enthusiasm and creativity of employees in production. In the patriotic production competition to resist US aggression and aid Korea, the Zhang Qiyun shaper group in the factory's machine shop learned the advanced experience of the Ma Hengchang group and continuously improved tools and operating techniques in their work, achieving a major achievement of no defective products for five months. The administration did not vigorously assist the trade union in cultivating such a model production group and promoting this advanced work experience. Rationalization proposals submitted by workers are approved very slowly, often taking one or two months to get a reply. There is also a lack of patient and detailed explanation and help for proposals that are not approved. Even those that are approved are implemented very slowly. The proposal by worker Jia Shuhuai to change the shaper tool holder to automatic up and down feed has been submitted and approved for six or seven months, but it has not yet been implemented. Workers are very discouraged by this approach, believing that the administration is unwilling to help workers improve production by improving tools and operating methods. In addition, in handling daily work, they only focus on handling problems based on the reports of individual Party members and Youth League members, without conducting in-depth and comprehensive investigations, which makes employees have concerns in their minds and dare not boldly express their opinions, holding the attitude of so-called "burying themselves in hard work and speaking less idle talk," and dare not boldly take responsibility for their work.
　　Why do these shortcomings arise? The main reason is that the factory's administrative leaders only pay attention to mastering business and neglect the strength of the masses. They believe that they have many years of revolutionary experience or work experience and are fully capable of doing things well. They think that many things are troublesome and slow through the masses, and it is faster and easier to decide for themselves and tell them to do it. The fact is just the opposite. Many good plans, precisely because they neglect the strength of the masses and do not inspire the masses to consciously and voluntarily strive to complete the plan, result in the plan not being completed and things not being done well. Some are satisfied with book knowledge, thinking that workers don't understand anything, "At best, they can only be foremen." They irresponsibly dismiss the rationalization proposals made by workers, saying, "This opinion is good, but it lacks a theoretical basis and I'm afraid it won't work?"
　　Because the factory's administrative leaders neglect the strength of the masses and are satisfied with past achievements, they bow to difficulties when they encounter them, and blindly emphasize objective difficulties, without studying ways to overcome them. The large gears and burr rollers that were cast were scrapped in large quantities due to sand holes. The leading cadres did not study solutions, but attributed it to the weather being too cold, or thought that there were problems with the sand and iron quality. The serious disconnection and chaos in the current production are blamed on the higher authorities for determining the tasks too late, and the tasks are not consistent with the equipment. Therefore, they do not actively organize and rely on the strength of the vast number of employees to find ways to overcome them. Secondly, the leaders are trapped in the circle of affairs. Even workers' sick leave must be approved by the factory director, who is busy stamping documents all day long. However, they do not pay attention to studying solutions to the situation where the absenteeism rate of some workshops is over 10%. There is no inspection and supervision of various tasks, and they cannot grasp important work links.
　　In the past, the factory leaders did not report the above situation to the Northwest Industrial Department, and the Northwest Industrial Department did not conduct in-depth inspections in a timely manner, which hindered the progress of production. Recently, the Northwest Financial and Economic Committee, the Northwest Federation of Trade Unions, and the Northwest Industrial Department sent a working group to the factory to inspect the work. Only then did they discover the above problems and have assisted the factory in gradually carrying out reforms. Under the assistance of the working group, the factory's administrative leaders have made a more profound review of their past work to all employees, and mobilized the masses to expose the reasons for production disconnection and the phenomenon of no one being responsible. They have also organized a labor competition with the goal of "improving quality and reducing defective products," focusing on the foundry workshop. The enthusiasm of the employees is very high. Through this movement, they are vigorously reorganizing administrative organizations at all levels, clarifying responsibilities and division of labor, preparing to establish the main responsibility system, and strengthening planning and various statistical work, in order to gradually move towards the economic accounting system in a planned way. In order to do the above work well, a regular learning system has been established among the cadres to strengthen ideological education and further establish the thinking of relying on the working class.

　　只注意掌握业务，忽视工人群众力量
　  西北机器厂生产工作陷于被动和混乱
　  经过上级检查开始改进，准备加强计划性建立责任制。
    西北机器厂行政干部不依靠工会，不重视工人合理化建议，劳动力组织不好，使生产完全陷于被动和混乱。直到最近经西北财政经济委员会、西北总工会与西北工业部工作组协助检查与改进，生产才又逐步好转。
    今年该厂订了全年按月生产进度计划，并交职工讨论，但因这个计划太空了，没有进一步去帮助车间按照机器设备与劳动力配备情况，定出各种机件的先后施工程序的具体计划，职工讨论时感到空洞，无法订出具体的小组与个人计划，实施时没法掌握。在生产中，又因缺乏深入的检查与统计工作，从上到下，不了解真实的生产情况，使各车间的生产，不断发生严重的混乱和脱节现象。如：按生产任务，龙门刨车组活多，原计划非开三班不能完成，但由于铸件供应不上，直到四月二十日前只开单班。
    该厂生产中的没人负责现象到处存在，主要的如：一、技术问题没人负责。铸件报废是该厂生产中很严重的问题，但却没有专人负责组织研究解决，浪费了很多工料。去年十二月至今年二月间铸造了一批大牙轮与刺毛辊，就因报废而浪费了一百七十五个工。又如五月八日开小炉铸造的九十九根盖条，就有七十八根报废。二、模样保管没人负责。几千种模样没有分类，凌乱地放置库房中。当铸造某些清花机零件时，有的模样找了很久才找到，有的因一时找不到，只得让木工间重做，但做好后，原来的模样又找出来了，浪费了工料。三、生产设备没人负责。今年的生产任务因龙门刨少，虽开三班还完不成任务。但有一部调拨来的龙门刨，仅因缺少部分机件，没人认真督促进行修理，一直空着不能使用。使用的锅炉，因烧炉工人缺乏经验，又没人负责检查指导，在二月间曾因缺水烧塌锅心，几乎引起爆炸，损失很大。
    在生产中，造成上述混乱、脱节与没人负责等严重现象的主要原因，是该厂行政领导干部缺乏对人民事业高度负责的精神，在工作中没有充分发扬民主，不重视群众意见；拖拉疲蹋，不能主动及时处理工作。
    行政领导同志不重视工人意见。对生产中的混乱与脱节现象，工会和群众都非常关心，他们曾想出各种办法，建议行政方面设法加以克服。如在讨论全年按月生产进度计划时，工会就曾一再要求把计划订得更具体些，而行政却强调客观困难，不予重视。工人张清华在四月份曾用书面向工厂管理委员会建议，要求设专人负责检查与督促各车间的生产进行，减少生产中的混乱脱节与无人负责现象。但行政领导却以抽不出人为理由，一推了事。又如检验标准、工具管理、考工、牌箱管理、月终考绩、施工等制度，在去年十二月底的工厂管理委员会上，就已决定要迅速建立起来，而且办法条文也已于今年元月草拟了出来，但直到现在还压在办公桌里，没有组织工人讨论并实施，结果使群众认为工厂管理委员会解决不了问题，不愿多提意见。
    行政领导同志不认真帮助与发挥职工在生产中的积极性和创造性。在抗美援朝爱国生产竞赛中，该厂机工场张启云牛头刨小组，学习了马恒昌小组的先进经验，在工作中不断改良工具与操作技术，获得了五个月不出废品的重大成绩。对这样的模范生产小组，行政方面没有大力协助工会加以培养，并推广这种先进工作经验。对工人提出的合理化建议，审批得很慢，常有一两个月得不到答复的。对批不准的建议，也缺少耐心详细解释和帮助。就是批准的，也实施得很慢。工人贾树淮提出的改牛头刨刀台为自动上下走刀的建议，从送审和批准到现在已六、七个月了，但仍未实行。工人对这样做法很泄气，他们认为行政方面就不愿帮助工人用改良工具与操作方法来提高生产。加上在处理日常工作中，只偏重根据个别党员团员的汇报去处理问题，不作深入的全面调查，就使职工群众在思想中存有顾虑，不敢大胆表示自己的意见，抱着所谓“埋头苦干，闲话少说”的态度，不敢对工作大胆负责。
    为什么会产生这些缺点呢？主要是该厂行政领导干部只注意到业务的掌握，忽视了群众的力量。他们认为自己有着多年的革命经验或工作经验，满能把事情搞好。他们以为许多事情通过群众，既麻烦又缓慢，反不如自己决定了，就叫他们干，还来得迅速省事。事实恰好相反，许多良好的计划，正由于他们忽视群众的力量，不去启发群众自觉自愿地为完成计划而奋斗，结果，计划不能完成，事情不能做好。有的满足于书本知识，认为工人不懂得什么，“再好，顶多只能当工长。”对于工人所提的合理化建议，竟然毫不负责地抹煞，说：“这意见，好是好，就是缺乏理论根据，恐怕行不通吧？”
    由于该厂行政领导干部忽视群众力量，满足于过去的成绩，因此一遇到困难，就向困难低头，一味强调客观困难，不钻研克服办法。铸造的大牙轮、刺毛辊，因出砂眼而大量报废，领导干部不研究解决办法，反而归因于天气太冷，或是认为砂子不好和铁质等有问题。对目前生产中存在的严重脱节与混乱现象，则归咎于上级确定任务过迟，和任务与设备不相一致。因而不去主动地组织与依靠广大职工力量，设法加以克服。其次领导上陷于事务圈子。甚至连工人请病假也要厂长批准，整天忙于盖章。但对有些车间工人缺勤率达百分之十以上的情形，却不注意研究解决办法。对各种工作没有检查督促，抓不住重要工作环节。
    以上情况，过去该厂领导既未向西北工业部报告，而西北工业部也未及时进行深入检查，以致阻碍生产的进步。最近西北财政经济委员会、西北总工会与西北工业部派工作组到该厂检查工作，才发现以上问题，并已协助该厂逐步进行改革。在工作组协助下，该厂行政领导干部对过去的工作，已向全体职工作了较深刻的检讨，并发动群众揭发生产脱节原因与无人负责现象。并以铸工场为重点，组织了以“提高质量，减少废品”为中心目标的劳动竞赛，职工情绪非常高涨。通过这一运动，正进行大力整顿各级行政机构，明确职责与分工，准备建立主要的责任制，加强计划与各种统计工作，以便有计划地逐步走向经济核算制。并为做好上述工作，在干部中已开始建立经常的学习制度，以加强思想教育，进一步确立依靠工人阶级思想。（群众日报）
