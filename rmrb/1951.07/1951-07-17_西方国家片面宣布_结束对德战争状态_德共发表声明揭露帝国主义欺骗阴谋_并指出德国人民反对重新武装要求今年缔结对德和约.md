Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 16th: TASS Berlin, 16th: According to a report by the German News Agency, the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party issued a statement regarding the so-called "end of the state of war with Germany" by Western countries.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party pointed out: The purpose of the Western countries' declaration of "ending the state of war with Germany" is to establish a legal basis for refusing to sign a peace treaty with Germany and for permanently maintaining the occupation system within Germany. The declaration of "ending the state of war with Germany" is intended to divert the attention of the West German people from the actual situation, thereby preparing the psychological ground for establishing a West German mercenary army within the Atlantic military bloc. The declaration of "ending the state of war with Germany" aims to make the German people believe that this step is being taken to give them "equality," and thereby prepare them to sacrifice themselves for the war aims of American and German imperialists in a third world war, six years after the end of the Second World War.

The German people do not need this; they need the immediate conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, the restoration of the unity of their country, and the withdrawal of all occupation forces. Only the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany that stipulates the withdrawal of all occupation forces within one year can return the right to national self-determination to the German people.

The Soviet representative repeatedly suggested to the Western countries at the London Foreign Ministers' Conference in 1947, at the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference in 1949, and at the Prague Foreign Ministers' Conference in 1950 that they immediately draft a peace treaty with Germany, stipulating the withdrawal of all occupation forces within one year. This Soviet proposal fully conforms to the national interests of our people in all respects, but it was rejected by the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France because they wanted to keep their occupation forces stationed in West Germany and maintain the occupation system.

The political measures taken by the American imperialists and their representative in West Germany, Adenauer, especially the re-militarization and the Schuman Plan, are the greatest threat to peace in Europe and the greatest threat to the life and survival of our people.

"Only in a united, independent, democratic, and peace-loving Germany can peace, democracy, and the peaceful life and work of our people be guaranteed. Therefore, the German Communist Party demands:

One, stop all re-militarization measures, stop Adenauer's negotiations on forming a German mercenary army, stop measures to establish disguised military forces under the guise of border guard units, mobile police, and other names;

Two, reject the Schuman Plan;

Three, negotiations between representatives of West Germany and East Germany should begin on the restoration of the unification of the motherland;

Four, immediately conclude a peace treaty with Germany stipulating that all occupying forces withdraw from Germany within one year.

These demands are in line with the interests and will of the entire German people. In West Germany, despite the police measures, tens of thousands of people every day are responding to the call of the Central Committee of the People's Referendum, voting against German re-militarization and demanding the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany in 1951.

The People's Referendum movement is continuing uninterrupted and has become a powerful demonstration by our people to fight for peace, unity, democracy, and the independence of the motherland."

　　西方国家片面宣布“结束对德战争状态”
    德共发表声明揭露帝国主义欺骗阴谋
    并指出德国人民反对重新武装要求今年缔结对德和约
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社柏林十六日讯：据德意志通讯社报道，德国共产党中央委员会书记处就西方国家所谓“结束对德战争状态”发表了声明。
    共产党中央委员会指出：西方国家发表“结束对德战争状态”的声明，目的是要为拒绝签订对德和约和永远维持德国境内的占领制度确立法律上的根据。“结束对德战争状态”的声明，是为了转移西德人民对实际情况的注意，并从而为在大西洋军事集团内建立西德雇佣军准备心理基础。“结束对德战争状态”的声明，目的是要使德国人民相信，采取这一步骤是为了给他们以“平等”，并从而准备使他们在第二次世界大战结束六年后的今天，再在第三次世界大战中为美国与德国帝国主义者的战争目的而牺牲。
    德国人民不需要这个，他们需要立即缔结对德和约、恢复他们国家的统一并撤退一切占领军。只有缔结一个规定在一年以内撤退一切占领军的对德和约，才能把民族自决权归还给德国人民。
    苏联代表在一九四七年伦敦外长会议上、在一九四九年巴黎外长会议上以及在一九五○年布拉格外长会议上，曾屡次建议西方各国立即草拟对德和约，规定在一年以内撤退一切占领军。苏联这一建议，在各方面都符合我国人民民族利益，但遭到了美、英、法三国代表的拒绝，因为他们要使他们的占领军留驻西德并维持占领制度。
    美帝国主义者和他们在西德的代表阿登纳所采取的政治措施，特别是重新军国主义化和舒曼计划，是对欧洲和平的最大威胁，也是对我国人民的生命和生存的最大威胁。
    “只有在统一、独立、民主而爱好和平的德国，和平、民主和我国人民的安居乐业才能获得保证。因此德国共产党要求：
    一、停止一切重新军国主义化的措施，停止阿登纳所进行的编建德国雇佣军的谈判，停止在边防部队、机动警察和其他种种名目下，建立伪装的军事部队的措施；
    二、拒绝舒曼计划；
    三、西德与东德代表间就恢复祖国的统一开始谈判；
    四、立即缔结对德和约，规定一切占领军队在一年以内撤出德国。
    这些要求是符合全体德国人民的利益和意志的。在西德，尽管有着警察措施，现在每天仍有数万人响应人民投票中央委员会的号召，投票反对德国重新军国主义化并要求在一九五一年内缔结对德和约。
    人民投票运动仍在不间断地继续进行中，并且已成为我国人民争取和平、统一、民主和祖国独立的强大示威。
