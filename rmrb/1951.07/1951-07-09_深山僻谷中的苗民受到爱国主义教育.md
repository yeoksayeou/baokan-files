　　Miao People in Remote Mountain Valleys Receive Patriotic Education
    More than ninety percent of the tens of thousands of Miao people scattered in the remote mountain valleys of northeastern Fujian Province have received patriotic education, and they generally have a preliminary understanding of the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea.
    The county committees of the Communist Party of China in Luoyuan, Xiapu, Lianjiang and other counties in northeastern Fujian Province attach great importance to the propaganda and education work among the Miao people. Since the launch of the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, the county committees of the Chinese Communist Party have sent many cadres to the districts and townships where the Miao people live and where the Han and Miao people live together, to assist the local people in holding representative conferences to resist US aggression and aid Korea. The Luoyuan County Branch of the Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea Association organized five propaganda teams, each equipped with slide projectors, Pinghua (i.e., drum lyrics), waist drum teams, etc., which were most welcomed by the Miao people, to sing for the local people in the remote mountains. The team members helped the Miao people with their labor and production, and at the same time used forums and family visits to carry out propaganda work, which was warmly welcomed by the Miao people. In order to conduct regular propaganda and education work among the Miao people, the local Communist Party organization has specially developed a number of Miao propagandists.
    At various meetings, the Miao people accused the Japanese invaders, Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and local despots of various crimes against them, which deepened their hatred of American imperialism and enhanced their political consciousness and patriotic enthusiasm. They signed patriotic pacts one after another, enthusiastically signed their names in support of the conclusion of a peace pact and voted against the United States arming Japan, and voluntarily tightened their belts and donated money to comfort the Chinese and Korean People's forces. A mountain song is popular among the Miao people: "If the neighbor's house is on fire and you don't save it, it will be difficult for us to survive when it burns into our own house. If you don't kill the wild wolves in the barren mountains, they will eat cattle, chickens, and people. Everyone come to fight the American wolf, everyone come to save our good neighbor Korea, resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homeland, the Miao people will turn over forever!" Some said: "In the past, the Miao people thought that if we overthrew the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and local despots, there would be nothing wrong with the world, but now we understand that there is still American imperialism that is against us." This year, on May 1st, International Labor Day, some Miao people came from the deep mountains forty or fifty miles away, carrying rifles, shotguns, hoes, sickles, etc., to participate in the demonstration parade. They excitedly sang a fast-paced song: "In the past, we flashed around and couldn't be seen (referring to avoiding being conscripted by the Chiang Kai-shek gang and being forced to pay rent and extorted by local despots), but today we swagger and line up in a dragon formation. The Chinese people are united and powerful, and the American imperialists, Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and local despots are frightened."
    Now they have signed patriotic pacts, guaranteeing a 10% increase in production this year. The Miao people of Xialiukeng Village in Luoyuan County have launched a patriotic production increase competition to the farmers of the whole county, and have received responses from farmers in more than 30 villages near the village.

### 深山僻谷中的苗民受到爱国主义教育

　　深山僻谷中的苗民受到爱国主义教育
    散居在福建省东北部深山僻谷中的十数万苗族人民，已有百分之九十的人受到了爱国主义教育，他们对抗美援朝运动一般都有了初步认识。
    福建省东北部罗源、霞浦、连江等县的中国共产党县委员会，都很重视对苗族人民的宣传教育工作。自抗美援朝运动开展以来，各县中共县委会曾派出许多干部，到苗民聚居和汉、苗两族人民杂居的区、乡，协助当地人民召开抗美援朝代表会议。罗源县抗美援朝分会曾组织了五个宣传队，每队都备有最为苗民所欢迎的幻灯、评话（即鼓词）、腰鼓队等，到崇山僻谷中为当地人民演唱。各队队员一面帮助苗族人民劳动生产，一面利用座谈会、家庭访问等方式进行宣传工作，受到了苗民的热烈欢迎。当地共产党的组织为在苗族人民中经常进行宣传教育工作，并特发展了一部分苗民宣传员。
    苗族人民在各种会议上，控诉了日寇、蒋匪、恶霸地主摧残他们的种种罪行以后，加深了对美帝国主义的仇恨，更提高了政治觉悟和爱国热情。他们纷纷订立爱国公约，踊跃签名拥护缔结和平公约和投票反对美国武装日本，并自动节衣缩食，捐款慰劳中朝人民部队。在苗民中流行着下面一首山歌：“隔壁起火那因（若不的意思）救，烧进大门咱难存。荒山野狼不打死，吃牛吃鸡又吃人。齐人（大家的意思）都来打那美国狼，齐人都来救那朝鲜好邻房，抗美援朝保家园，苗家翻身万万年！”有的说：“过去苗家以为打倒蒋匪军和恶霸地主，天下就无事了，现在明白了还有美帝国主义和我们作对。”今年“五一”国际劳动节，有的苗民从四、五十里以外的深山里，扛着步枪、鸟枪和锄头、镰刀等，赶来参加示威游行。他们兴奋地唱起快板道：“过去闪来闪去不见人（指躲避蒋匪帮抓丁和恶霸地主逼租勒索），今朝大摇大摆排龙阵。中国人民团结力量大，美帝蒋匪恶霸地主吓落魂。”
    现在他们已经订立爱国公约，保证今年增产一成。罗源县下流坑村全村苗族人民向全县农民提出爱国增产竞赛的挑战，已得到该村附近三十多个村庄农民的应战。
