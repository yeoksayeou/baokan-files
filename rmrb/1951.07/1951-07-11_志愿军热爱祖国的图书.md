Volunteer Soldiers Love Books of the Motherland
    Liu Lanshan

    The movement to collect books and periodicals for the Volunteer Army, initiated by Xinhua Bookstore and enthusiastically responded to by the people of the whole country, has collected more than two million books from February to the end of May. In order to send these books to the hands of the Volunteer Army, Xinhua Bookstore organized battlefield cultural service teams to be responsible for transferring and organizing reading. They sent books to the front line by the truckload, and carried them in sacks to the barracks and trenches.

    Since the Volunteer Army soldiers and service personnel entered the Korean battlefield to fight last winter, most of them have not read books from their motherland, and some have not even seen printed Chinese characters for a long time. Sometimes, they repeatedly read a small piece of old Korean newspaper with Chinese titles printed on it, and then reluctantly cut it off to roll cigarettes. This was still a rare cultural food in the trench life! Under such circumstances, how happy would the soldiers be when they saw the books sent by the people of the motherland.

    Every soldier not only asks for cultural food in the garrison, but also hopes to see books from the motherland on the battlefield full of artillery fire. They used the books and periodicals they received to establish small libraries in their companies, and organized collective reading and rotation reading in a strict manner, so that every soldier had the opportunity to read all the books.

    Company life is often tense, and there is very little time to read, but the brave and hardworking soldiers seize all the free time to read widely. Sometimes, they ask a soldier to read while they eat, and everyone listens while eating. In the squad, literate and illiterate soldiers are organized on a voluntary basis, with one literate soldier "teaching" two or three illiterate ones. Whenever there is free time, they gather together to read. Therefore, every Sunday or during weekday breaks, the kang mats, courtyards, under the trees, and by the streams of the company's residence have become places for learning, filled with pleasant reading sounds.

    The soldiers not only like to read, but also take great care of the books. They have mostly established "Book Care Pledges," stipulating that under normal circumstances, they will not write on the books, tear them, or put them in their trouser pockets to avoid damaging them. The soldiers often say, "The people of the motherland have put in so much effort to send us books. We would be letting down the people of the motherland if we don't study hard, and we would also be letting down the people of the motherland if we don't take good care of them!" Some soldiers even compared books to weapons for killing the enemy, proposing the slogan: "We must cherish books as we cherish our weapons!"

    In the arduous and tense combat life, Volunteer Army soldiers like to read combat-oriented comic strips, especially those depicting the deeds of Volunteer Army combat heroes, which are widely and enthusiastically welcomed; quick-patter talks, poems, and short plays also have a large readership. Cadres like to read some medium and short war novels, such as "Days and Nights" and "Courage and Fear" from the Soviet Patriotic War, which are works that everyone never tires of reading. They not only improved their cultural level from reading, but also improved their political awareness and increased their courage to kill the enemy. Luo Mingtang, a machine gunner in a certain unit, said after hearing someone read "Combat Hero Chen Baofu": "Being brave and calm will win battles. Comrade Chen Baofu fought well, won the title of hero, and met Chairman Mao. We must follow his example." In the companies that have established libraries, reading books has become an indispensable part of the Volunteer Army's combat life.

    Many book donors wrote their names, addresses, and simple, powerful, and sincere words of comfort on the books, which also greatly encouraged the soldiers. For example, Zhang Xueying from the Public Security Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government wrote on a copy of "Catching and Releasing American Soldiers" that he donated: "You (referring to the Volunteer Army) are bravely killing the enemy in Korea and defeating the American invaders; we are working hard to eliminate special agents and protect the security of the motherland at home." Xu Defa, a worker from Tianjin, wrote on a copy of "Production Front" that he donated: "Your great spirit has encouraged us to overfulfill our production tasks!" Starting from their own business work and linking the Korean front with the motherland, vividly illustrating the people of the motherland's high enthusiasm for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and their love for the Volunteer Army as if they were their own brothers, is a great encouragement to the Volunteer Army soldiers and officers who are fighting bravely. In particular, the words written by Wang Xiulan, a fourth-grade elementary school student from Andong City, on a copy of "The History of American Imperialist Aggression Against China" deeply moved the Volunteer Army soldiers. These words were: "Volunteer Army brothers: American planes bombed Andong, and I can't go to school; I'm sending you a small book, kill more American bandits!" After reading these lines, the soldiers were all determined to kill more American devils in the next battle and avenge the children of the motherland.

### 志愿军热爱祖国的图书

　　志愿军热爱祖国的图书
    刘岚山
    由新华书店发起的为志愿军募集书刊的运动，在全国人民热烈响应之下，从二月开始，到五月底为止，已经募集了图书二百多万册。为了把这些图书送到志愿军手里，新华书店组织了战地文化服务队，担负转送和组织阅读的工作。他们一车又一车地把图书送上了前线，又一麻袋一麻袋地分别背负到军营和战壕里。
    志愿军指战员和战勤人员们，自从去年冬天进入朝鲜战场作战以来，大多数都没有读到祖国的图书，有的甚至在很长的时间内连铅印的方块字也没有看见过。有时，他们把一小块印有中文标题的朝鲜旧报纸，反复地念了几遍，然后才恋恋不舍地裁掉卷烟吸，这还是战壕生活中难得的文化食粮哩！在这种情形下，当指战员们看到祖国人民送来的图书时，他们该是多么高兴呀。
    每一个指战员，不但在驻军中要求获得文化食粮，就是到了炮火炽烈的战场上，也希望能够看到祖国的图书。他们用收到的书刊建立了连队的小型图书馆，又以严密的办法组织集体阅读和轮流阅读，使每一个战士都有机会看完全部的图书。
    连队生活经常是紧张的，能够看书的时间很少，但英勇勤劳的战士们却抓紧一切空隙时间，普遍地进行阅读。有的时候，他们在吃饭时推一名战士念书，大家一边吃饭一边听。在班里，识字的和不识字的战士，都在自愿的基础上组织起来，一个识字的“包教”两三个不识字的，一有闲空，就围在一块阅读起来。因此，每到星期天或平日休息的时候，连队驻地的炕席上、院场里、树荫下、涧溪边，都成了学习的场所，充满了愉快的朗朗的书声。
    战士们不但欢喜看书，对于图书的爱护，也是非常细心而周到的。他们大都订立了“爱书公约”，规定在平常的情况下，不在书上涂写，不把书撕破，不将书装在裤袋里，以免磨坏。战士们常常这样说：“祖国人民费了好大心血，为我们送来图书，要不好好学习，就对不起祖国人民；爱护得不好，也对不起祖国人民！”有的战士甚至把图书比做杀敌的武器，提出口号来说：“我们要像爱护武器一样来爱护图书！”
    在艰苦的紧张的战斗生活中，志愿军战士都很喜爱看富有战斗性的连环画，尤其是描绘志愿军战斗英雄人物事迹的，更受到普遍而热烈的欢迎；快板、诗歌、短剧等也拥有广大的读者。干部们则欢喜阅读一些中篇和短篇的战争小说，如苏联卫国战争时期的《日日夜夜》、《恐惧与无畏》等，都是大家百读不厌的作品。他们不但从阅读中提高了文化水平，更从阅读中提高了政治觉悟，增加了自己杀敌的勇气。某部机枪班射手罗明堂，在听人念过“战斗英雄陈宝富”之后说：“勇敢沉着，就能打胜仗。陈宝富同志打得好，得了英雄称号，见过毛主席，我们要向他看齐。”建立了图书馆的连队，阅读图书已成为志愿军战斗生活的不可少的一部分。
    许多赠书人在图书上面，写下了自己的姓名、地址和简单有力而恳切的慰问词，这也对战士起了很大的鼓舞作用。如黑龙江省人民政府公安厅张学英在他所捐献的一本《捉放美国兵》上写道：“你们（指志愿军）在朝鲜英勇杀敌，把美国侵略军打垮；我们在国内努力肃清特务，保卫祖国的安全。”天津市工人徐德发在他捐献的《生产战线》一书上写着：“你们伟大的精神，鼓舞了我们超额完成生产任务的情绪！”这种从本身的业务工作出发，把朝鲜前线和祖国联系在一起，生动地说明了祖国人民抗美援朝的高度热情和对志愿军亲如手足的热爱，给予正在英勇作战的志愿军指战员们的鼓舞，是非常之大的。尤其是安东市四年级小学生王秀兰在一本《美帝侵华史》上写的几句话，更使志愿军战士们深受感动。这几句话是：“志愿军哥哥：美国飞机炸安东，我念不成书；送本小书给您，多杀美国贼！”战士们看了这几行字以后，大家都下定决心，要在下次战斗中，多杀美国鬼子，为祖国孩子们复仇。
