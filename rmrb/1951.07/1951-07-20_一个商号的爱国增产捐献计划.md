　　Editor's Note: Jinzhou City's Shanhai Sundries Store, Fushenghe, has formulated a six-month patriotic donation plan centered on improving business management, accelerating capital turnover, and developing urban-rural trade. This plan can serve as a reference for industrial and commercial circles in various regions.
　　Jinzhou City's industrial and commercial circles have responded to the "June 1st" call of the Chinese People's Committee Against American Aggression and Aid Korea and have initially decided to donate three fighter planes. Our firm is determined to actively increase income, save expenses, contribute our possible strength, and donate generously to achieve this overall goal. We recognize that our ability to operate normally and gradually develop is due to the establishment of the People's Republic of China and the victories in resisting American aggression and aiding Korea over the past six months. After joint discussion by all staff members, based on the expansion of existing funds, the business situation in the first half of the year, and the favorable conditions in the second half of the year, we have decided to donate 23 million RMB. The six-month production increase and donation plan is as follows:

  I. Improve Business Management and Increase Income
    (1) Expand Capital. The original capital was 37.67 million RMB. By investing the accumulated funds from 1950 and the net profit from the first half of this year, the capital will be increased to 73.8166 million RMB, nearly doubling it, which will greatly increase the purchase volume.
    (2) Increase income during the off-season months of July, August, and September in a planned manner. Based on past experience, we will specifically dispatch salesmen to rural areas to contact sales channels and develop urban-rural trade. The sales locations will be Chaoyang, Beipiao, Lingyuan, Yixian, Liujiazi, Xingcheng, Jinxi, Jinxian, Gaoqiao, etc., and can be expanded at any time depending on the situation. We will adopt the principle of small profits and quick turnover to increase income without being limited by the off-season.
    (3) Have accurate targets for purchasing and selling goods in advance. Purchases from Shenyang, Taonan, Andong, Tianjin, and other places will all have appropriate sales channels. Before each purchase, we will understand the market conditions and demand in various places, hold meetings to discuss, avoid buying unsalable goods, and prevent the accumulation of capital, ensuring that goods are purchased and sold quickly, guaranteeing that capital turns over at least two more times in the second half of the year.
    (4) Establish a strict capital management system, reduce internal overspending and underpayments, and reduce external borrowing. Borrowing by "contracted" individuals must be decided after a meeting to ensure that it does not affect capital flow.
    (5) Increase retail sales, attract more customers, and conscientiously implement clear and marked prices, not relying solely on wholesale.
    (6) Change the old habits of merchants in the past. Managers and all personnel should participate in various tasks, with clear division of labor internally and externally, to improve work efficiency and prevent loopholes in management.
    By improving business management and accelerating capital turnover through the above aspects, we guarantee that the minimum sales volume in six months can reach 770.98 million RMB. With a gross profit of 2%, after deducting taxes and all expenses (including an increase of 700,000 RMB in employee salaries), the net profit can reach 64.24 million RMB, an increase of 28.094 million RMB compared to the first half of the year, donating 20 million RMB to purchase airplanes and cannons.

  II. Save Expenses and Reduce Waste
    The expenses in the first half of the year totaled 33.39 million RMB. In the second half of the year, we will reduce waste in food expenses (without lowering food quality), use more of our own trucks for delivery and reduce hiring horse carts, and reduce unnecessary electricity and other miscellaneous expenses in empty rooms. We can save at least 500,000 RMB per month, totaling 3 million RMB in six months, which will be donated in full.

  III. Payment Date
    Three million RMB will be paid in July, and the remaining amount will be paid in installments each month, completing the payment within six months.
    All personnel of our firm have confidence in realizing this plan and strive to exceed it. We will also work hard to study current affairs, study business, strive for more production increase, and more donations to express our love for the motherland and our love for the Chinese People's Volunteers. We will also use this to launch a patriotic donation competition with other firms in the city.

　　一个商号的爱国增产捐献计划
    编者按：锦州市山海杂货业福生合号，以改善经营管理，加速资金周转，开展城乡贸易为中心，订出了半年的爱国捐献计划。这个计划可供各地工商界参考。
    锦州市工商界响应中国人民抗美援朝总会“六一”号召，已初步决定捐献战斗机三架。本号决心为完成这一总的目标而积极增加收入，节省开支，贡献可能的力量，大量捐献。我们认识到：我们所以能正常营业，并逐步得以发展，是由于中华人民共和国的成立，半年来抗美援朝的胜利。经全体柜伙共同商讨，从现有资金的扩大、上半年营业情况及下半年的有利条件等方面算细账的结果，决定捐献人民币二千三百万元。兹订出半年增产捐献计划如下：
  一、改善经营管理，增加收入
    （１）扩大资金。原资金三千七百六十七万元，把一九五○年积金与今年上半年的纯益投入，使资金增到七千三百八十一万六千元，扩大近一倍，从而将大大增加购货量。
    （２）有计划地增加七、八、九月淡季的收入。根据过去的经验，我们要专门派推销员，面向农村，联系销路，开展城乡贸易。推销地点为朝阳、北票、凌源、义县、六家子、兴城、锦西、锦县、高桥等，并可根据情况随时扩大，采取薄利多销的方针，不为淡季所限，以增加收入。
    （３）购货销货预先有准确目标。向沈阳、洮南、安东、天津等地购货，均有适当的销路。每次购货前了解各地行情及市场需要量，开会讨论，不买押手货，不积压资金，做到随购随销，保证下半年资金多周转二次。
    （４）建立严格的资金管理制度，对内减少长支短欠，对外减少挪借。“相契”人家挪借，须经过开会研究决定，以不影响资金流动为原则。
    （５）增加零售量，多招揽主顾，认真执行明码实价，不单靠批发。
    （６）改变过去商人中的旧习气，经理与全体人员均应参加各种工作，内外有明确分工，提高工作效率，使经营方面不出漏洞。
    从上述几方面改善经营管理，加速资金周转，保证在半年内最低卖钱额可达七亿七千零九十八万元，以毛利二分计，除纳税与一切开支（店员薪金增加七十万元），纯益可达六千四百二十四万元，较上半年增加二千八百另九万四千元，捐献二千万元购买飞机大炮。
  二、节省开支，减少浪费
    上半年的开支计三千三百三十九万元，下半年从减少伙食方面的浪费（不是降低伙食）；多用本柜货车子送货，少雇马车；减少空房不必要的电灯及其他杂支费用，最低每月可节省五十万元，半年计三百万元，全部捐献。
  三、交款日期
    七月份交三百万元，余款每月陆续交，半年交齐。
    本号全体人员一致有信心实现这一计划，并争取超过计划。我们并将努力学习时事，研究业务，争取更多的增产，更多的捐献，以表示我们对祖国的热爱，对中国人民志愿军的热爱。我们并以此向本市各商号作爱国捐献竞赛。
