    Leading Organs of Jing County, Hebei Province
　　Have Not Conscientiously Publicized and Implemented the Marriage Law
To the Editor:
    In the rural areas of Jing County, Hebei Province, the phenomenon of forced and arranged marriages is still very serious; many women are still under the yoke of feudal marriage. The reason for this is that the local party and government leading organs have not conscientiously implemented the Marriage Law and have not waged an irreconcilable struggle against feudal remnant ideas, but have instead adopted an attitude of indifference towards the behavior of some people who violate the Marriage Law.
    According to our understanding, many people in the county have a very poor understanding of the Marriage Law. In Jia Lü Village in the Fourth District of the county, many people do not understand the content of the Marriage Law, and some have not even heard the term Marriage Law. Therefore, when young people in the village get married, most of them still rely on "the command of their parents and the words of a matchmaker," and do not register with the district people's government in accordance with the Marriage Law; early marriage is also very serious. However, the local government does not pay attention to these illegal phenomena. This kind of forced arranged marriage makes many young men and women in the village, especially women, live in pain. Although they are extremely dissatisfied with their marriages, they are bound by feudal concepts such as "a hen follows the rooster, a dog follows the dog" and fatalistic ideas of resignation, and dare not file for divorce. For example, Liu Lanfen, a sixteen-year-old girl from Jia Lü Village, was betrothed by her parents last year. She was very dissatisfied with this matter; but she did not dare to say so, but only cried secretly. After she got married this year, she was often beaten and abused, and her life was very painful, but she did not dare to file for divorce, but said pessimistically and desperately: "My life is over. There is no good way other than death." Her situation has already affected the emotions of many unmarried young women in the village.
    We suggest that the Party and government leading organs of Jing County deeply publicize and conscientiously implement the Marriage Law, and educate the masses to get rid of the influence of feudal ideas, in order to gradually eliminate the feudal marriage system of forced arranged marriages.

### 河北景县领导机关　未认真宣传贯彻婚姻法

    河北景县领导机关
　　未认真宣传贯彻婚姻法编辑同志：
    河北省景县农村中，强迫包办婚姻的现象还很严重；许多妇女还处在封建婚姻的枷锁下。其原因是当地党政领导机关没有认真贯彻婚姻法、没有和封建残余思想作不调和的斗争，而却对某些人违反婚姻法的行为采取了置之不理的态度。
    据我们了解，该县许多人对婚姻法的认识是很差的。该县四区贾吕村就有很多人不了解婚姻法的内容，甚至有些人还没有听到过婚姻法这个名词。因此，该村青年结婚，大部还是凭“父母之命，媒妁之言”，不按照婚姻法到区人民政府登记；早婚的现象也很严重。而当地政府对这些违法现象却并不过问。这种强迫包办的婚姻，使该村很多青年男女，尤其是妇女，生活在痛苦之中。她们虽然对自己的婚姻感到极端不满，但却被“嫁鸡随鸡，嫁狗随狗”的封建观念和听天由命的宿命论思想所束缚，不敢提出离婚的要求。如贾吕村十六岁的女孩刘兰芬，去年由父母作主订了婚。她对这件事很不满；但却不敢提出，只是暗自哭泣。今年她结婚后，经常挨打受气，生活很痛苦，但她也不敢提出离婚，只是悲观绝望地说：“我这一生算完了，除了死以外，没有别的好办法。”她这个事情，已经影响了该村很多未婚青年妇女的情绪。
    我们建议景县党政领导机关深入宣传并认真贯彻婚姻法，教育群众摆脱封建思想的影响，以逐步消灭强迫包办的封建婚姻制度。
