Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 25th: Farmers in Wushi Township, Xiangtan County, Hunan Province—the hometown of General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army—wrote a letter to Commander Peng before the "August 1st" Army Day, reporting on the situation of anti-American and aid-Korea work in their township. The original letter is as follows:

　　Dear Commander Peng:

　　When we learned that the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army was under your command fighting against the American aggressor bandits, we felt infinite glory! Your hometown, Wushi Township, after the movement to resist America and aid Korea, the land reform, and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the entire township has shown a thriving scene. The vast number of farmers have already been distributed land. Politically, the number of members of the township farmers' association has grown to account for 46 percent of the total population, and the township people's government and militia armed forces have been established and are becoming increasingly consolidated. Zhou Jiwu, Chen Keben, and two other major despots in Wushi Township, who had colluded with the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past, massacred more than ten Communist Party members and revolutionary farmers in Wushi Township, and twice dug up your ancestral graves, have been subjected to the legal sanctions of the people's government in the land reform and suppression of counter-revolutionaries.

　　All the farmers in Wushi Township know that today's happy life was earned by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party leading the people in struggle for decades, and it can only be preserved by the heroic volunteer army defeating the American bandits. After we understood this truth, our patriotic production enthusiasm continued to rise. We also invested the fruits of victory in grain seized from landlords into production. The entire township has increased by fourteen cattle, more than two hundred and seventy hoes, rakes, dozens of plows, and a large amount of fertilizer this year. Farmland throughout the township has generally been plowed and harrowed four times, and the amount of fertilizer applied has increased by about 30 percent compared to normal years. Now, the rice in Wushi Township is growing vigorously and has begun to bud and head, and a bumper harvest is promising. In response to the call to "plant cotton patriotically," the cotton field area in the entire township this year has expanded four times compared to normal years. In addition, 65 farmers have voluntarily combined to organize five mutual aid groups. These mutual aid groups have become the important backbone of the township's participation in donating to the "Mao Zedong Hometown" fighter plane campaign. For example, after the eleven households in the Liang Guiqiu mutual aid group set a production increase donation plan of 1,200 jin of grain, they motivated the surrounding farmers to also set production increase donation plans. In the patriotic production increase donation movement, farmers in Wushi Township have learned that patriotic production increase donation is a practical action to support our most beloved people and also to defend their own fruits of victory.

　　The great "August 1st" Army Day is approaching. The farmers of your hometown have decided to hold a grand celebration on that day, and in the ten days before, they will carry out in-depth anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda and education, check on the preferential treatment and cultivation work for the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers, the donation plan for the "Mao Zedong Hometown" fighter plane, and generally establish patriotic covenants. We know that doing these tasks well is a sincere support and highest respect for you and the heroic volunteer army you lead!

　　Wish you health and victory!

　　All farmers in Wushi Township, Xiangtan County

　　July 23rd

　　湖南湘潭乌石乡农民
　  致函彭德怀司令员
　  报告家乡抗美援朝工作
    【新华社长沙二十五日电】中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军故乡——湖南省湘潭县乌石乡的农民，于“八一”建军节前写信给彭司令员，报告他们乡里抗美援朝工作的情形。原信如下：亲爱的彭司令员：
    当我们知道英雄的中国人民志愿军是由你指挥着在打击美国侵略强盗的消息时，我们感到无限的光荣！你的故乡——乌石乡经过抗美援朝、土地改革及镇压反革命运动后，全乡已呈现出欣欣向荣的景象。广大农民已经分到了土地。在政治上，全乡农民协会会员已发展到占总人口百分之四十六，并建立了日益巩固的乡人民政权和民兵武装。乌石乡大恶霸周季武、陈可本等四人，过去曾与国民党反动派勾结，在乌石乡屠杀过十多个共产党员和革命农民，并曾两次挖掘你的祖坟，他们已先后在土地改革及镇压反革命运动中受到人民政府的法律制裁。
    全乌石乡农民都知道：今天的幸福生活，是毛主席和共产党领导人民斗争了几十年才得来的，也是英雄的志愿军打败了美国强盗才能保住的。我们懂得了这个道理后，爱国生产的热情就不断高涨起来。我们把从地主手里夺来的谷子的胜利果实也投入了生产。全乡今年增加了十四头牛、二百七十多把锄头、耙头、数十张耕犁和大量肥料。全乡农田普遍作到四犁四耙，施肥量较常年提高了百分之三十左右。现在，乌石乡的水稻已长得茂盛茁壮，并已开始打苞抽穗，丰收大有希望。为了响应“爱国植棉”的号召，今年全乡棉田面积较常年扩大了四倍。此外，还有六十五户农民自愿结合组织了五个互助组。这些互助组成为本乡参加捐献“毛泽东故乡号”战斗机的重要骨干，如梁桂秋互助组的十一户农民，订出了一千二百斤谷的增产捐献计划后，带动了周围农民也纷纷订了增产捐献计划。乌石乡农民在爱国增产捐献运动中，知道了爱国增产捐献是支援我们最可爱的人，同时也是保卫自己的胜利果实的实际行动。
    伟大的“八一”建军节快到了。你故乡的农民决定在当天举行盛大的庆祝会，并在前十天即开始进行深入抗美援朝的宣传教育，检查对革命烈士家属、革命军人家属的优抚代耕工作和“毛泽东故乡号”战斗机的捐献计划，以及普遍订立爱国公约。我们知道作好这些工作，就是对你和你领导的英雄的志愿军所表示的衷心支援和最高敬意！
    祝你健康和胜利！
    湘潭县乌石乡全体农民
          七月二十三日
