　　Universities in Beijing Discuss the Korean Armistice Negotiations, Resolve to Intensify the Resist-America, Aid-Korea Campaign

[This Newspaper Reports] Eight hundred professors and staff members from Beijing Normal University, the Engineering Institute of North China University, and Yenching University have jointly issued declarations regarding the Korean armistice negotiations, unanimously agreeing that it is necessary to continue strengthening the Resist-America, Aid-Korea work. The declaration jointly issued by 302 members of the Beijing Normal University Trade Union, including Li Jinxi, stated: "The Korean armistice negotiations prove how heavy the blows of the Chinese people's Resist-America, Aid-Korea, and Defend-the-Homeland movement and the heroic battles of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army have dealt to the American aggressors." "But this does not mean that the Korean issue can be completely resolved, nor can it be said that the United States will abandon its conspiracy and actions of aggression; on the contrary, even if the US imperialists are forced to cease fire in Korea, it is only the first step in resolving the Korean issue. It still occupies our territory of Taiwan and is increasingly stepping up the arming of Japan. All these facts tell us: if we have any illusions about US imperialism because of the Korean armistice negotiations, lower our vigilance, and relax our Resist-America, Aid-Korea work, it is absolutely wrong."

More than 30 professors from the Engineering Institute of North China University, including Zeng Yi, Li Shoutong, and Li Linyu, signed and issued a declaration after holding a forum on the 6th, pointing out: "True peace can never be obtained in fantasy, but must be strived for with concrete actions; striving for lasting peace will be a long-term political struggle, and every Chinese people has the responsibility to engage in this struggle, so that this struggle will ultimately be victorious."

Four hundred and fifty-six members of the Yenching University Trade Union, including Lin Geng, and four non-Trade Union staff members, jointly issued a declaration stating that to stop imperialist aggression and strive for peace in Asia and the world, the key lies in consolidating our national defense and strengthening our strength.

In their declarations, the professors and staff of the above three schools unanimously expressed their enthusiastic response to the call of the Resist-America, Aid-Korea General Association, and pledged to earnestly implement the patriotic pact and step up production and donations. The professors of the Engineering Institute of North China University also said in their declaration: "We are determined to use the summer vacation, use all our technical knowledge, to manufacture instruments and medicines, repair machines, translate books, and in various ways, increase production and donations."

In addition, Furen University professors Zhao Guangxian, Chai Degeng, and Ye Cangcen held a forum on the Korean armistice negotiations on the evening of the 5th. The professors pointed out in the forum that under the heavy blows of the Chinese and Korean people's forces and the demand for a ceasefire by peace-loving people around the world, the American aggressors had to express their willingness to accept Malik's proposed armistice negotiations. This is the result of the Chinese people's resolute resistance to America and aid to Korea and the Korean people's heroic struggle. We must continue to strengthen the Resist-America, Aid-Korea work, strive to donate airplanes and artillery, encourage students to actively participate in military cadre schools, strengthen national defense construction, and strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue so that it is possible to ensure the smooth progress of the motherland's construction in all aspects, and world peace will have the strength to be maintained.

　　京各大学讨论朝鲜停战谈判问题
    决加紧抗美援朝工作
    【本报讯】北京师范大学、华北大学工学院、燕京大学的教授、员工八百人，分别就朝鲜停战谈判问题联名发表宣言，一致认为必须继续加强抗美援朝工作。师范大学工会会员黎锦熙等三百零二人联名发表的宣言中说：“朝鲜停战谈判，证明了中国人民的抗美援朝保家卫国运动和中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军的英勇作战，对于美国侵略者的打击是何等的沉重。”“但这并不是说朝鲜问题就可以彻底解决了，也更不能说美国就会放弃它侵略的阴谋及行动；相反的，美帝国主义者即使被迫在朝鲜停战，也只是解决朝鲜问题的第一步。它还占据着我们的领土台湾，并且越来越加紧地武装日本。这一切事实，就告诉我们：如果因朝鲜停战谈判而对美帝国主义抱有任何幻想，降低我们的警惕性和松懈我们的抗美援朝工作，那是绝对错误的。”
    华北大学工学院曾毅、李寿同、李麟玉等三十多位教授在六日举行座谈会后，签名发表宣言指出：“真正的和平决不能在空想中得到，而必须用具体的行动去争取；争取持久和平将是一个长期的政治斗争，我们每一个中国人民都有责任从事这个斗争，使这个斗争最后得到胜利。”
    燕京大学工会会员林庚等四百五十六人及非工会会员职工四人，联名发表宣言称：要制止帝国主义侵略，争取亚洲及世界的和平，关键在于巩固我们的国防，壮大我们的力量。
    上述三校教授、员工在宣言里，一致表示热烈响应抗美援朝总会的号召，保证认真执行爱国公约和加紧增产捐献工作。华北大学工学院教授们并在宣言中说：“我们决心利用暑假，利用我们所有的技术知识，制造仪器药品，修理机器，翻译书籍，用各种各样的方式，增产捐献。”
    又，辅仁大学教授赵光贤、柴德赓、叶苍岑等于五日晚座谈了朝鲜停战谈判问题。教授们在座谈中指出：在中朝人民部队的沉重打击，世界爱好和平人民要求停火的情况下，美国侵略者不得不表示愿意接受马立克建议的停战谈判。这是中国人民坚决抗美援朝和朝鲜人民英勇斗争的结果。我们必须继续加强抗美援朝工作，努力捐献飞机大炮，同学们踊跃参加军事干部学校，加强国防建设，争取朝鲜问题的和平解决才有可能，才能保障祖国各方面建设的顺利进行，世界和平才有力量维持。
