　　"Grammar and Rhetoric Talks" Help Us
    Learn to Use Language Correctly
    Editor's Note: Mr. Lü Shuxiang and Mr. Zhu Dexi's "Grammar and Rhetoric Talks" have been published in our newspaper for two installments, and the third installment is about to be published. During this period, we received many letters from readers warmly welcoming these talks because they meet their urgent needs. Many parts are original creations, which have not been discussed in any past grammar and rhetoric books, or have not been systematically discussed. What is published here is a part of these reader letters. Some readers have raised some questions about the talks and requested answers. Some of them asked questions that had already been discussed in the previous parts because they had not read the talks from the beginning; some of the questions will be discussed later; we do not intend to answer these. In addition, some questions need to be answered publicly, and we will ask the authors to summarize and selectively answer them after the talks are published to avoid overburdening the authors. As for some individual, more specialized questions that need to be gradually solved in future research and discussion, we do not intend to answer them one by one, but we will definitely forward all these letters to the authors for reference when revising the talks or continuing research in the future.

　　《语法、修辞讲话》帮助我们
    学会正确使用语言
    编者按：吕叔湘、朱德熙二位先生的《语法、修辞讲话》，已在本报陆续发表了两讲，现在第三讲即将发表。这个期间，我们接到许多读者来信，热烈欢迎这个讲话，因为这个讲话满足了他们的迫切的需要，其中有许多部分是一种创作，是过去任何文法修辞书上所没有讲过，或没有有系统地讲过的。这里所发表的就是这些读者来信中的一部分。还有一部分读者对于讲话提出若干问题，要求回答。他们有的是因为没有把讲话从头读起，所以提出的问题是前面已经讲过的；有的问题是以后要谈到的；这些我们都不预备答复了。另外有些问题是需要公开回答的，我们将待讲话登完以后，再请作者综合择要作答，以免作者负担过重。至于个别的较专门的问题，需要在今后的研究讨论中慢慢求得解决的，我们也不预备一一答复，但我们一定将所有这些来信转给作者在修订讲话时或今后继续研究时作参考。
