To the Editors of the People's Daily:

We sincerely accept and thank Comrade Tang Guang for the criticism published in the reader's letter column of your newspaper on May 30th, regarding our insufficient leadership in labor competitions, with too many general appeals and too little specific help. We are now sending you our self-criticism and work report for publication.

When the patriotic labor competition to Resist America and Aid Korea began last November, we called on workers in various factories to challenge the Wu Kaiyun team. However, after the movement started, there was insufficient inspection; the Wu Kaiyun team's achievements were not announced in the newspapers in a timely manner; at that time, we were also busy with convening the Third Second Representative Congress of Tangshan City, and trade unions at all levels, including the city's Federation of Trade Unions, were busy with elections, summaries, and the transmission of resolutions. Therefore, we did not grasp it tightly, which caused the competition to show a state of decline in January and February 1951.

After the Ma Hengchang-style team competition was launched, we did not widely introduce the experience of the Ma Hengchang team during the process of formulating challenge conditions, and our help and inspection were not specific and timely. As a result, the conditions set were sometimes too high and became a formality.

There was indeed a lot of work in April, and much of it had deadlines. This did place a significant burden on comrades in the grassroots trade unions. At that time, in addition to the Ma Hengchang-style team competition, there were also large-scale campaigns to suppress counter-revolutionaries, sign in support of the conclusion of a peace treaty, oppose American imperialism's rearmament of Japan, prepare for the May Day parade and demonstration, implement labor insurance publicity and card registration, and inspect the Trade Union Law, etc. Although we also worked hard and wanted to further study leadership methods to better arrange the work, we did not fully achieve our wishes.

Regarding the convening of the representative meeting of teams challenging Ma Hengchang, we originally planned to convene it in April, but on the one hand, the higher authorities had not yet approved the expenditure of funds, and on the other hand, we felt that there was indeed too much work in April, so it was postponed to May 8th. This should be explained.

The labor competition achieved considerable results in May. Cadres were assigned to factories to take charge, provide specific leadership, and exchange advanced experiences from various factories, enabling the movement to develop steadily. There was a general over-fulfillment of production targets, and the quality also improved significantly. The development of rationalization proposals, technological improvements, adjustments to labor organization, and reductions in the rate of industrial injuries became the characteristics of the May competition, and the phenomenon of crash campaigns was basically prevented.

### 唐山市总工会关于领导劳动竞赛不深入的检讨答复

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    唐山市总工会关于领导劳动竞赛不深入的检讨答复人民日报编辑同志：
    五月三十日贵报读者来信栏发表的唐广同志对我们领导劳动竞赛不够深入、一般号召多、具体帮助少的批评，我们诚恳地接受，并致谢意。现在将我们的检讨和工作情况寄给你们，请予发表。
    去年十一月间开始开展抗美援朝爱国主义劳动竞赛时，我们曾号召各厂职工向吴开云小组应战。但是运动起来之后，检查不够；对吴开云小组成绩，在报上公布也不及时；当时又赶上召开唐山市三届二次代表大会，各级工会以至市总工会都忙于选举、总结及决议的传达；因此，我们抓的不紧，使一九五一年一、二月间竞赛呈现了消沉状态。
    马恒昌式小组竞赛开展后，在订立应战条件的过程中，我们未广泛地介绍马恒昌小组经验，帮助和检查也不具体和及时，因而订出的条件，曾经发生有的订的过高、流于形式主义的现象。
    四月份工作，确实较多，而且多是限期完成的。这的确给了基层工会的同志以重大的负担。当时除马恒昌式小组竞赛外，如大张旗鼓镇压反革命，拥护缔结和平公约的签名，反对美帝国主义重新武装日本，准备“五一”游行大示威，实行劳动保险的宣传和卡片登记，检查工会法等等。我们虽然也曾努力，想从领导方法上进一步研究，使工作排列的更好一些，但并没有完全达到愿望。
    关于召开向马恒昌应战小组代表会问题，我们原计划在四月份召开，但是一方面因为经费开支问题上级尚未批下来，另一方面感觉四月份工作确实太多，所以延到五月八日才开，这是应该说明的。
    劳动竞赛五月份获得不少成绩，干部分厂负责，具体领导，交流了各厂先进经验，使运动稳步地向前开展。在产量上普遍超额完成任务，质量上也有显著提高。合理化建议的展开，技术改进，劳动组织的调整，工伤率的降低，成为五月竞赛的特点，并基本上防止了突击现象。
          唐山市总工会
