　　Regarding the Issue of the Withdrawal of Foreign Troops from Korea
　  The U.S. Representative Persistently Refuses to Include it on the Agenda
　  The Korean Negotiation Conference Adjourns for Three Days to Allow Both Sides to Consider Carefully
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 21st] This reporter learned from the headquarters on the Korean front: The eighth meeting of the Korean armistice negotiation conference began at 9:00 AM (Korean time) on July 21st and ended at 10:35 AM.
    Since the first day of the negotiation conference, the delegation of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers has proposed that the negotiation conference should discuss and determine the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line between the two sides, withdraw all foreign troops from Korea, and specific arrangements for ceasefire and armistice. Although in the past seven meetings, the two sides have reached partial agreement on the issue of the conference agenda, the United Nations Command delegation has consistently refused to include the issue of the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea on the agenda, that is, refused to discuss this issue in the meeting. Because the issue of the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea is of great importance to ensuring that the Korean War does not break out again, at the eighth meeting, when the United Nations Command delegation once again refused to include this issue on the agenda, the delegation of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers proposed a three-day adjournment, so that both sides would have sufficient time to carefully consider this issue.
    After agreement by both sides, it was decided that the ninth meeting would be held at 10:00 AM on July 25th.

　　关于外国军队撤出朝鲜问题
　  美方代表始终拒绝列入议程
　  朝鲜谈判会议休会三天以便双方慎重考虑
    【新华社平壤二十一日电】本社记者自朝鲜前线总部获悉：朝鲜停战谈判会议第八次会议，在七月二十一日上午九时（朝鲜时间）开始，十时三十五分结束。
    自从谈判会议的第一天起，朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军代表团就提出，谈判会议应该讨论确定三八线为双方的军事分界线，从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队，及停火与休战的具体安排等主要问题。虽然在过去的七次会议之中，双方在会议议程的问题上已经取得了部分协议，但是联合国军代表团始终拒绝将一切外国军队撤出朝鲜的问题列入议程，即拒绝在会议中讨论这一问题。因为一切外国军队撤出朝鲜的问题，对于保证朝鲜战争不再爆发有着重大的关系，所以在第八次会议中，当联合国军代表团再度表示拒绝将这一问题列入议程时，朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军代表团即提议休会三天，以便双方有充分时间对于这一问题加以慎重的考虑。
    经过双方同意后，决定第九次会议在七月二十五日上午十时举行。
