　　Marriage (Novel)
    Ma Feng
    Editor's Note: This novel by Comrade Ma Feng, through the vivid and concise depiction of the marriage of two young rural men and women, demonstrates how young people in rural China, under the leadership and education of the Chinese Communist Party, actively participate in social activities and correctly handle the relationship between the individual and the collective, private life and political life. The novel is full of new, optimistic spirit. The language of the novel is also the healthy language of the Chinese people. This is one of the excellent short stories with educational significance produced by literary and art workers faithfully implementing Mao Zedong's line on literature and art.

　　Tian Chunsheng, the secretary of the Youth League branch in Qingshui Village, woke up four times in one night, anxious to go to the district to get his marriage certificate. He got up before dawn, ate breakfast, changed into a white cotton shirt, and hurried off. The sun had just risen over the mountains when he left the village.

    Tian Chunsheng's fiancée is named Yang Xiaoqing, the daughter of Yang Wanyou, a labor hero from Liulin Village. She is three years younger than Chunsheng, and is twenty years old this year. Chunsheng and Xiaoqing had never met each other before. They met and fell in love during the district's village theater troupe competition last Spring Festival. They wrote to each other frequently, and soon it was a success.

    The elders of both families were very happy to hear about this. It was really a coincidence that Chunsheng's father and Yang Wanyou were also acquainted. Seven or eight years ago, because they couldn't pay their rent, they were both sent to the black house of the detention center by the landlords with two-finger-wide strips, and lived together for more than half a month. Unexpectedly, in the new society, they became relatives, and they both urged them to hold this happy event as soon as possible. But this happy event has been going on for a year now, and it hasn't been done yet.

    Last year after the summer harvest, it was originally said that they would get married. Chunsheng's whole family was busy preparing for the wedding: building a house, making bedding... everything was ready, and the date was also chosen, but suddenly Xiaoqing sent a letter saying that the wedding date had to be postponed. Chunsheng hurried to Liulin Village to ask Xiaoqing the reason. Xiaoqing said, "The county recently held a 'Maternal and Child Health Training Class', and the village and district agreed for me to study there. What do you think?" Chunsheng didn't stop her, he smiled and said, "This is learning the skills to serve the people, I can't delay your future, I agree!" So the matter was put aside, and the old couple were happy for nothing. When Xiaoqing came back from studying, it was already winter, and the old couple urged their son to seize the opportunity to hold the wedding quickly. Chunsheng went to Xiaoqing to negotiate, Xiaoqing said, "Look how anxious you are! I just came back from studying, and the village's maternal and child health work hasn't started yet. If I'm busy with personal matters, the masses will be affected badly! I was thinking of waiting until after the Lunar New Year..." Chunsheng didn't wait for her to finish, he smiled and said, "I'm too individualistic, I agree with your opinion."

    Once the Lunar New Year was over, preparations for spring plowing began. This year is the year of the Great Production Movement, and the central task of the Youth League is to lead the youth to step up production. Chunsheng is both the secretary of the Youth League branch and the leader of the mutual aid group, mobilizing everyone to select seeds, buy new farm tools, dig wells, plant trees, and there is a lot of work to do. He is busy from morning till night every day, and he can't even think about getting married. Only his mother sometimes says, "When will this be done! Oh, my little ancestors!" Now that the spring plowing is over, and there are still half a month or twenty days before the wheat harvest, the old couple urged their son again and again. Yesterday afternoon, Chunsheng took a trip to Liulin Village and talked to Xiaoqing for a long time. At first, Xiaoqing said, "Can't we wait another month or so, until after the wheat harvest? Why the hurry now?" But she couldn't resist Chunsheng's repeated persuasion, and finally Xiaoqing smiled and said, "You! Really... Okay, as you wish!" That's how it was decided. They agreed to meet at the district office today, rain or shine.

    Tian Chunsheng left the village and walked along the road. On both sides of the road were rows of neat small trees, which he led the youth of the village to plant on Qingming Festival. He thought to himself: In another ten years, I wonder how tall these trees will grow...

    At the bend ahead, there were a dozen or so small willows. One of them was crooked and about to fall, probably hit by a cart. Chunsheng hurried over, straightened it, and used his foot to pack some soil around it. When he saw these small willows, he felt an inexplicable surge of warmth in his heart. These willow cuttings were carried back from Liulin Village by him personally. That day, Xiaoqing smiled and said to him, "You must guarantee that they all survive!" Chunsheng also smiled and said, "These were cut from your trees, they will definitely want to live in our village!" Xiaoqing "giggled" with laughter.

    Xiaoqing is so lovely when she laughs! Her laughter is loud and crisp, like ringing a bell. Chunsheng has never seen her angry. It seems that she doesn't have even a shadow of sorrow in her heart. On her rosy round face, there is a pair of sparkling eyes. When Chunsheng sees those two big eyes, he thinks of the two headlights on the front of a car in the dark night, illuminating people's hearts.

    Chunsheng walked and thought: Xiaoqing is probably on her way to the district too. Before noon, he will be able to see Xiaoqing, and the two of them will put their fingerprints on that bright red marriage certificate... Chunsheng couldn't help but smile secretly when he thought about his future life. Just then, he suddenly heard the shouts of "De - Yoho, De - Yoho" ahead. He quickly looked up and saw a three-team rubber-wheeled cart stuck in a mud pit. The cart was loaded with a load of goods: there were wooden boxes, there were sacks, piled up like a small mountain. The driver was desperately whipping the mules, desperately shouting. The animals were sweating all over, their nostrils were spewing out rough air, like bellows, their hooves had dug the road into pits, but the cart didn't move at all. Chunsheng ran over to help for a long time, but it didn't help at all. The driver cursed the animals, and then angrily whipped them a few more times. The lead mule bent its front legs and simply lay down in the mud. The driver threw the whip on the ground and squatted on the side of the road in anger. Chunsheng rubbed the mud on his hands and asked:
    "Where is this cargo from?"
    "It's relief goods from the district, to be sent to the station!" The driver wiped the sweat from his head with his sleeve and said anxiously, "Each district has to send them today, and they will be loaded on the train to Korea this afternoon, and there are still eighty miles to go! This, this, what bad luck!"

    When Chunsheng heard that these were gifts from the masses to comfort the volunteers, he knew that there could be no delay. His family also sent them, and there was a letter of condolence written by him personally. Xiaoqing also sent two comfort bags with embroidered words. Chunsheng went back to the cart and looked carefully, and said to the driver:
    "It rained heavily here the day before yesterday. Look, the mud has sucked the wheels. The cart is heavy. I think we have to unload the goods first, pull the empty cart out first, and then load the goods back on. Come on, I'll help you!"

    The driver looked at Chunsheng and said happily:
    "Oh! That's what we have to do! But it will be slow with just two people. Don't you have anything important to do?"

    Chunsheng thought of his appointment with Xiaoqing, but he said, "It doesn't matter! It's getting late, hurry up and untie the ropes." He climbed onto the cart and unloaded, thinking that this cart of relief goods was more important than a marriage certificate. This is the heart of 300,000 people, we can't miss the train loading time.

    Two young women passed by on the road. Chunsheng said to them, "Hey! Give us a hand, this is relief goods for our volunteers!" When the two women heard that this was the case, and some of it was sent by them, they quickly came to help. Later, a few more people passed by, and Chunsheng called them all to stop. Everyone worked together to unload the things from the cart, and it took a lot of effort to pull the empty cart out of the mud pit. Everyone helped to load the relief goods back onto the cart, and tied them tightly. By this time, it was almost noon. The driver breathed a sigh of relief and said with a smile:
    "We finally got through this hurdle. If it wasn't for everyone, we would have missed a big thing!" He turned around and asked Chunsheng, "Which village are you from? Thank you so much!"
    Chunsheng wiped the sweat from his forehead and said:
    "Hurry up and get going, it's getting late!"

    Chunsheng watched the driver flick his whip, and the cart went north. Then he walked towards the district office. It was still fifteen miles to Baihe Town. He hurriedly strode forward, feeling anxious. It seemed that the sun was moving faster than usual. He thought: Xiaoqing must have arrived at the district office already, she must be anxiously waiting for him, maybe Xiaoqing is complaining that he is walking too slowly? Chunsheng wished he had wings to fly to Baihe Town. He rushed like a trot, the sun was like a ball of fire, and Chunsheng's heart was also like a ball of fire. After a burst of running, the Limin River appeared in front of him. This is the new river that was dug last year. The yellow river embankment is like a low earthen wall. Chunsheng knew that he had finished another ten miles, and he could see Baihe Town from the bridge. Thinking of Xiaoqing, he quickened his pace even more. He thought: In less than half an incense stick's time, he would be able to see Xiaoqing. The dazzling red marriage certificate would be in his hands...

    He climbed up the river embankment, and just as he reached the bridge, he suddenly saw a person running anxiously from the opposite side, and he saw several people chasing behind him, shouting loudly:
    "Don't let him run away! Spy! Spy!"

    Chunsheng was shocked. He stretched out his hands and rushed over. The person had just reached the other end of the bridge. When he saw someone blocking him, he turned around and ran south along the river embankment. Chunsheng took off his legs and chased after him. It was noon at this time, and the people planting crops had all gone home, so the spy was emboldened and ran for his life. Chunsheng used all his strength to chase closely. The spy turned around and threw something, and shouted, "Look at the grenade!" Chunsheng didn't pay any attention and kept chasing without taking a breath. The sweat on his head flowed into his eyes, stinging his eyes. He wiped it with his sleeve and chased for five or six miles. He was almost catching up, only a dozen steps away, five or six steps away..., but unexpectedly, he suddenly fell, and the shoe on his left foot fell off. He didn't even bother to put it on, and quickly got up and chased with one bare foot, shouting loudly, "Catch the spy! Catch the spy!"

    There were still a few people in the distance in the fields who hadn't finished work. When they heard someone shout to catch a spy, they ran over with hoes. After chasing for a while, there was a shepherd ahead who heard someone calling to catch a spy, and ran over with a sheep shovel. The spy saw that the situation was not good, and pounced on the river embankment from the side. When Chunsheng chased up the river embankment, the spy had already jumped into the river. The river water was waist-deep. The spy crossed the river while turning his head and panting:
    "We have no old grudges, no recent... resentments, you, old brother..."

    Chunsheng looked back and saw that the people behind him hadn't caught up yet. Seeing that the spy had already reached the center of the river. At this time, Chunsheng couldn't care about anything, he jumped into the river with a plop, and after two or three splashes, he pounced on the spy. The two of them started fighting. The spy bit Chunsheng's ear and pressed him into the water. Chunsheng screamed in pain, and suddenly swallowed two mouthfuls of water, with a spicy taste in his nose, rushing straight to his brain. But he grabbed the spy's hand and wouldn't let go. Just then, the group of people behind him and the shepherd all caught up, and everyone jumped into the river together to catch the spy.

    Chunsheng was helped to the river bank, his whole body turned into a drowned chicken, and he sat on the ground panting. His ear was also bitten, and blood flowed down his neck, staining the white shirt he wore for the wedding red. His left foot was also cut, and after being soaked in water, it hurt like needles. Everyone tied the spy up securely, and asked him how he was. Chunsheng shook his head and said, "It's okay!" He only asked them which village they were from, and how the spy escaped. The two people who chased him at first told him that they were from Qingshui Town. They were watering the fields and were on their way back when they saw the spy cutting the wires, so they chased after him. ...

    Everyone discussed sending the spy to the district quickly. At this time, Chunsheng thought of his own affairs, and thought of Xiaoqing still waiting in the district! He stood up abruptly and only said vaguely: "Okay, you take that son of a bitch there, I still have something important to do!" After speaking, he left, leaving everyone confused.

    He picked up the shoe he lost on the way, and hurried to Baihe Town. By this time, his clothes were dry, and the blood on his ear had stopped flowing. He ran to the district office, and the first thing he asked was, "A woman from Liulin Village, named Yang Xiaoqing, has she been here?"

    The people in the district office said in surprise, "Yang Xiaoqing? She hasn't come! How did you get like this?"

    Chunsheng was angry when he heard this. Without saying a word, he turned around and left. He thought Xiaoqing had already arrived and must be waiting impatiently, but he didn't know that she hadn't even come. Could it be that there was another change of heart this time, and they couldn't get married? Just as he came out of the gate of the district office, Xiaoqing arrived, covered in sweat. She said with a smile, "You must have been waiting anxiously, right? I got up early in the morning, and just as I was about to leave, a woman happened to be giving birth, so I went to deliver the baby. I finally finished. I was afraid you would be waiting anxiously in the district, so I hurried over. How did you get your clothes so dirty? Ah? Blood?..."

    When Chunsheng heard that Xiaoqing was also delayed for the sake of the people, he wasn't angry anymore. He quickly smiled and said, "I just arrived too." Then he told her about what he encountered on the road. At this time, the people from the district office also came out and surrounded him, listening very attentively. Just as they were talking, the people escorting the spy arrived. When those people saw Chunsheng and a woman being intimate together, they realized why he ran away in such a hurry. Xiaoqing couldn't restrain her enthusiasm at this time, and she rushed over and grabbed Chunsheng's hand, unable to speak for a long time; but her big eyes seemed to say:
    "You are so lovely!"

　　结婚（小说）
    马烽
    编者按：马烽同志的这篇小说，通过对两个农村青年男女的婚事的生动简洁的描写，表现了新中国的农村青年，在中国共产党的领导和教育下，怎样积极参加社会活动，怎样正确地处理个人与集体、私生活与政治生活的关系。小说充满新的、乐观主义的气息。小说的语言也是中国人民的健康的语言。这是文艺工作者忠实地执行毛泽东文艺路线所产生的、具有教育意义的优秀短篇创作之一。              
    清水庄青年团支部书记田春生，一夜醒来四次，急着要到区上领结婚证。天还不大明就起来了，吃完饭，换了件白洋布小褂，急急忙忙就起身。走出村子的时候，太阳刚刚才出山。
    田春生的对象叫杨小青，是柳林村劳动英雄杨万有的闺女，比春生小三岁，今年没零没整二十岁了。柳林村离清水庄二十里地，春生和小青以往谁也没见过谁，去年春节，全区村剧团比赛的时候才认识，一认识就恋爱上了，两个人经常书来信往，很快就成功了。
    两家的大人们，听到这事都很高兴。说起来也真巧，春生爹和杨万有老汉也认识。七、八年以前，两个人因为缴不起租子，被各家的地主用二指宽的条条送到看守所的黑房子里，一块住过半个多月。没想到新社会里他们变成亲家，都催着快快办这喜事。可是这喜事已经闹上够一年了，到如今还没办成。
    去年夏收以后，本来已经说好要结婚了。春生全家忙着筹办喜事：又是修房子，又是做被褥……什么都准备齐全了，日子也挑定了，可是忽然小青捎来封信，说是结婚的日子要往后推。春生急忙跑到柳林村，找小青问原由。小青说：“县里最近办了个‘妇婴卫生训练班’，村里和区上都同意我去学习。你觉得怎样？”春生没有拦阻，他笑说：“这是学习为人民服务的本事，我不能耽误你的前途，我同意！”就这样把件事搁过了，老俩口空喜欢了一场。小青学习完回来的时候，已经到冬天了，老俩口又催儿子快快抓紧时机办喜事。春生去找小青谈判，小青说：“看你急得！我刚学习回来，村里妇婴卫生工作还没开展，忙着就闹个人问题，群众影响多不好！我想过了旧历年再……”春生没等她说完就笑着说：“我太个人主义了，我同意你的意见。”
    一过旧历年，春耕准备工作就开始了，今年是大生产运动年，青年团的中心任务也是领导青年加紧生产。春生又是青年团支部书记，又是互助组小组长，发动大家选种啦，买新式农具啦，打井啦，植树啦，工作一大堆，每天从明忙到黑，结婚的事连想都顾不上想了。只有他娘有时候还说两句：“这可拖到什么年月啊！好我的小祖宗们咧！”现在，春耕已经结束了，离麦收还有半月二十天的工夫，老俩口又三番五次催儿子。昨天下午，春生去柳林村跑了一趟，和小青谈了老半天。起初小青说：“再过个把月，等麦收以后不好吗？现在急急忙忙的。”可是架不住春生左说右说，最后小青才笑着说：“你这个人呀！真是……好，由你吧！”就这样算是确定了。他俩约好今天到区公所碰头，不管刮风下雨，不见不散。
    田春生出了村子顺着大路往前走。路两旁是一行行整齐的小树，这是清明节那天，他领导全村青年们栽的。他心里想：再过十年，这些树不知会长得多么高大呢……。
    前边拐弯的地方，有十几棵小杨柳，有一棵歪歪斜斜的快倒了，大概是被大车挂的。春生紧走几步过去，把它扶正，又用脚拥了些土埋实。他看到这些小杨柳，心里就说不来的一股热劲。这些杨柳栽子，是他亲自从柳林村背回来的。那天，小青笑着对他说：“你可要保证都栽活啊！”春生也笑着说：“这是从你家树上砍下来的，一定愿意到我们村里去活！”说得小青“咯咯咯”的笑了。
    小青可爱笑哩！笑声又响又脆，笑起来和敲铃差不多，春生从来也没见她恼过，她好像心里连一点忧愁的影子也没有。她红扑扑的圆脸上，长着一对闪闪发光的大眼，春生一看见那两只大眼，就想起黑夜里汽车前头的那两盏灯，照的人心里都亮了。
    春生边走边想：小青这时大概也正往区上走咧，用不了晌午头，就能够看到小青了，两个人在那鲜红的结婚证上把手印一按……。春生想到以后的生活不由得偷偷的笑了。正在这时，忽听得前边“嘚——吆吼，嘚——吆吼”的叫喊声。忙抬头一看，只见一辆三套胶皮轮大车陷在泥坑里了。车上满载着一车货物：有木箱子，有麻袋，垒得像座小山。赶车的拚命甩鞭子，拚命叫喊。牲口浑身都淌汗了，鼻孔里喷着粗气，好像拉风箱一样，蹄子把路都刨成了坑，车却一动也不动。春生跑过去帮着赶了半天，仍然一点事也不顶。赶车的一面咒骂牲口，一面又恨恨地甩了几鞭子，辕骡前腿一打弯，索性卧到稀泥里了。赶车的把鞭子往地下一丢，气得蹲在路旁了。春生搓着手上的泥问道：
   “这是从那里拉的货？”
    “从区上拉的慰劳品呀，往车站送咧！”赶车的用袖子揩揩头上的汗，着急地说：“今天各区都要送到，下午就装火车往朝鲜送，还有八十里路咧！这，这，真倒霉！”
    春生一听这是群众慰劳志愿军的礼物，知道耽误不得。他家也送了，还有他亲手写的慰问信。小青也送了两个绣着字的慰问袋。春生重新到车跟前仔细看看，对车夫说：
    “前天这里雨下的大，你看稀泥把车轮吸住了，车又重，我看只有把货卸下来，先把空车拉出来，再把货装上。来来来，我帮你！”
    赶车的看了看春生，高兴地说：
    “哦！就得那么办哩！可是两个人弄得慢，你没紧要事吗？”
    春生想起他和小青约定了，可是他说：“没关系！天不早啦，你快解绳子吧。”他爬到车上就卸，心里想着这一车慰劳品比结婚证更重要，这是三十万人民的心，可别误了装火车的时间。
    路上过来两个年青妇女，春生向她们说：“喂！帮帮忙吧，这是送给咱志愿军的慰劳品啊！”两个妇女一听说是这么回事，其中也有她们送的，连忙过来帮着搬。后来又过来几个走路的人，春生把他们都叫住，大家七手八脚把车上的东西卸下来，费了很大劲，才把空车拉出泥坑。大伙又帮着把慰劳品装到车上，捆绑结实，这时已经是快晌午的时候了。赶车的长出了一口气，笑着说：
    “可算是过了一关，要不是大伙，准误下大事哩！”又回头问春生说：“你是那个村的？可要谢谢你啦！”
    春生擦着头上的汗水说：
    “你快赶上走吧，时光不早了！”
    春生看着赶车的把鞭子一甩，大车朝北走了，他才往区公所走。这里离百合镇还有十五里地，他急急忙忙迈开大步走着，心里着急，好像太阳也比平时走得快多了。他想：小青一定已经到区公所了，小青一定急得等他，说不定小青抱怨他走得慢呢？春生恨不得长个翅膀飞到百合镇，他像小跑一样赶路，太阳像一团火，春生的心也像一团火，一阵紧跑，利民河已经出现在前面了。这是去年才挖下的新河。黄色河堤像一条低的土墙。春生知道又把十里地走完了，站到桥上，就能望见百合镇了，心里想着小青，更加快了脚步。他想：再用不了半柱香工夫，就能见到小青了。大红耀眼的结婚证，就能拿到手里……。
    爬上了河堤，刚到桥跟前，忽见从对面慌慌急急跑来一个人，又见后边有几个人追赶，大声叫喊：
    “不要放跑！特务！特务！”
    春生心里一惊，两手往开一伸，就扑过去。那个人刚走到桥那头，一见有人拦住了，回身就顺河堤往南跑，春生拔腿就随后追。这时正是晌午头上，种地的人都回家了，特务放大了胆子，死命奔跑。春生用尽了全身气力，紧紧追赶，特务回身扔来个什么东西，并且大叫道：“看手榴弹！”春生连理也没理，仍然不松一口气的追。头上的汗水流到了眼里，渍的眼珠子发疼，他用袖子擦了一把，一直追了五六里远。看看快追上了，只差十几步了，五六步了……，却不料忽然摔了一跤，左脚上的鞋子掉了。他也顾不得穿，连忙爬起来，赤着一只脚追赶，一面大声喊叫：“抓特务！抓特务！”
    远处地里还有几个没收工的人，拿着锄头也追赶起来了。又追了一气，前边有个放羊的，听到有人叫抓特务，拿着羊铲迎头跑过来。那个特务看看架势不妙，从斜刺里扑上河堤，春生追上河堤的时候，特务已经跳到河里了。河水深到半腰间，特务一面过河，一面回过头来喘着气说道：
    “咱们远日无仇，近，近……日无冤，你，老老哥……”
    春生回头看了看，后边的人还没追上来，眼看特务已经走到河心了。这时春生什么也顾不得了，一扑也跳到了河里，三扑两扑就扑到了特务跟前，两个人就打起来了。特务一口就咬住了春生的耳朵，并且把他按在水里。春生疼得刚一叫喊，猛然喝了两口水，鼻子里一股辣辣的味，直冲脑子。但他抓住特务的手死死不放。正在这时，后边的那一伙人和放羊的都追上来了，大家一齐跳下河里，才把特务抓住。
    春生被扶到河岸上，浑身变成落汤鸡了，坐在地上一口接一口的喘气。耳朵也被咬破了，血顺脖子流下来，把结婚时穿的白小褂染红了一片。左脚也割破了，又经水一浸，疼得像针扎一样。大伙七手八脚把特务结结实实地捆起来了，都问他怎样，春生摇了摇头说：“不要紧！”只问他们是那个村的，怎么把特务跑了。起先追的那两个人告诉他说：他们是清水镇的，在地里浇水完了，正往回走，看见这个特务割电线，他们就连忙追赶。……
    大伙商议着把这个特务快送到区上去。春生这时想起了自己的事，想起了小青还在区上等着哩！他猛得站起来，只含含糊糊说了一句：“好，你们押着送那狗日的吧，我还有点要事咧！”说完就走了，弄得众人都莫明其妙。
    他在半路上捡上丢了的鞋子，一口气急走到了百合镇。这时衣服已干了，耳朵上的血也不流了。他跑到区公所，第一句就问：“柳林村一个女的，叫杨小青的，来过没有？”
    区上的人惊讶的说：“杨小青？没有来呀！你怎么弄成这个样子的？”
    春生一听可生气了，二话没说，扭头就走。他满以为小青早已来了，一定等的不耐烦，谁知连来都没来。难道这回又有了什么变卦，不能结婚了？刚出了区公所的大门，小青走得满头大汗的来了。她笑嘻嘻的说：“你一定等急了吧？我一早就起来，刚要走，凑巧一个妇女要生小孩，我就去给人家接生。好容易才弄完。我怕你在区上等的着急，赶紧就跑。你怎把衣裳弄这么脏哩？啊？血？……”
    春生一听小青也是为了人民的事耽搁了，哪里还生气，连忙笑着说道：“我也是刚到。”就把他路上遇的事说起来。这时区公所的人也出来，围住他十分注意地听着。正说间，押特务的来了。那些人一见春生和一个女的在一块亲热的样子，才知道他急急忙忙跑了的原因。小青这时捺不住她的热情了，一下就扑过来拉住春生的手，半天说不出话来；可是她那双大眼睛好像说：
    “你真可爱啊！”
