　　Pay Attention to Politics!
    The People's Bank's offering of prize-bearing savings is beneficial to both the nation and the people. Therefore, when conducting promotional activities for prize-bearing savings, we should first call on the people to actively save and assist the country in its economic construction, which is in line with the long-term interests of the people. After the people start saving, they can save some unnecessary expenses and may receive material rewards from the state, which is also beneficial to the current economic life of the people. Carrying out such publicity can not only complete the task of mobilizing the masses to save, but also enable the people to take a step forward politically through this work. However, the publicity made by the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank on this issue lacks political content. It can only simply guide the people to pursue personal interests and promote the backward ideas of some people, which is extremely harmful.
    Facts have proved that business that is divorced from political guidance will inevitably become something without prospects and without life. We hope that the comrades of the Beijing Municipal People's Bank will examine the non-political tendencies in their publicity work, strengthen political guidance for business work, and earnestly formulate methods to improve publicity work in the future.

　　注意政治！
    人民银行举办有奖储蓄，是既利于国家、又利于人民的。因此，在进行有奖储蓄宣传的时候，应该首先号召人民积极储蓄，协助国家进行经济建设，这是符合人民的长远利益的。人民实行储蓄以后，可以节约些不必要的开支，并可能获得国家的物质奖励，这对于人民当前的经济生活也是有利的。进行这样的宣传，不仅可以完成动员群众储蓄的任务，而且可以使人民通过这件工作，在政治上提高一步。而像人民银行北京分行在这个问题上所作的宣传，则是缺乏政治内容的，它只能单纯引导人民追逐个人利益，助长某些人的落后的思想，因此是极端有害的。
    事实证明：脱离了政治指导的业务，就一定会变成毫无前途、毫无生命的东西。我们希望北京市人民银行同志检查自己宣传工作中非政治化的倾向，加强对业务工作的政治指导，并认真订出今后改进宣传工作的办法。
