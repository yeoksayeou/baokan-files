(I) Conscientiously Establish and Inspect Production Increase and Donation Plans

The movement to donate airplanes and cannons has unfolded across the country. The number of airplanes for which donations have been decided or initiated in various regions has reached 2,146, in addition to some tanks, cannons, and other equipment. At present, this movement should be carried out universally and in depth to strive for greater donation achievements and consolidate existing results. Further mobilizing the masses to establish practical and feasible donation plans for increasing production and income, and conscientiously implementing them, is the key to deepening the movement.

The principle of this donation movement is to complete the donations from increased production and increased income. This principle has already proven to be completely correct. Many factories, rural areas, government agencies, schools, and industrial and commercial households in various regions, as a result of carefully planning donation plans, have further stimulated the enthusiasm of the masses and made new achievements in production, business, and work. For example, the Zhang Guangyuan group of the Shanghai Hui Gong Iron Factory, after establishing a production increase and donation plan, produced a total of 1,083 sewing machine housings in June, exceeding the monthly production quota of 600 by 80 percent. Farmers in Liuhe Village, Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province, after establishing a production increase and donation plan, may produce 90 more *shi* of grain just by increasing hoeing and fertilization. Jinzhou Fushenghe increased its profits in the second half of the year by about 80 percent compared to the first half of the year by improving business management. These facts illustrate the enormous significance of establishing and implementing production increase and donation plans for ensuring the completion of donation tasks and promoting various construction undertakings. However, there is also a situation where some workers, students, and teachers save on their meal expenses, reduce their living standards, or use their own clothing for donations. This high degree of patriotism is good and should be commended, but we do not need to donate by tightening our belts and reducing expenses. We should mainly increase donations by increasing production and increasing income.

In order to universally mobilize the masses to establish production increase and donation plans, we must first do a good job of publicity and education, explaining to all the people the significance of establishing production increase and donation plans for supporting the front lines, consolidating national defense, and promoting production and construction, and explaining that increasing production and donations must rely on everyone's highly patriotic enthusiasm, everyone thinking of ways to determine specific goals, and reaching these goals in a planned and step-by-step manner.

Because leading organs and the people lack experience in establishing donation plans to increase production and income, each region and unit can adopt the method of cultivating typical examples, gaining experience, and promoting comprehensive progress. Jinzhou City, Liaoxi Province, and the industrial and commercial circles in Beijing have promoted their work by using this method. These experiences can be used for reference by other regions.

Furthermore, large-scale production increase and donation plans must be guaranteed by the plans of grassroots units and the masses in order to be truly realized and not fall through. Liuhe Village, Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province, first mobilized all the villagers to think of their own methods for increasing production and donations, and formulated production increase and donation plans for mutual aid groups and individuals, and then centralized them to formulate a plan for the entire village. This plan is practical and has a guarantee of being realized. All parts of the country must do this.

In order to ensure the realization of the production increase and donation plan, the main contents of the donation plan must be included in the patriotic pact, and a regular inspection system must be established. Only in this way can we understand the implementation of the donation plan at any time, discover and promote successful experiences, and discover and solve various problems that occur in the movement. Otherwise, even if the donation plan is well-formulated, it may become a mere formality.

### （一）切实订立和检查增产捐献计划

  （一）切实订立和检查增产捐献计划
    捐献飞机大炮运动已在全国展开，各地决定捐献和发起捐献的飞机已经达到两千一百四十六架，此外还有一些坦克大炮等。目前还应该普遍和深入地开展这个运动，以便争取更大的捐献成绩并巩固已有的成绩，而进一步发动群众，订立切实可行的增加生产和增加收入的捐献计划，并认真地加以执行，就是使运动深入开展的关键。
    此次捐献运动的方针，是从增加生产和增加收入中来完成捐献。这一方针已经证明是完全正确的。各地已有不少的工厂、农村、机关、学校和工商户，由于精打细算订出捐献计划的结果，进一步发挥了群众的积极性，在生产、营业和工作上作出了新的成绩。如上海市惠工铁工厂的张光远小组，在订立增产捐献计划以后，六月份共生产了一千零八十三支缝纫机车壳，超过了每月六百支的生产定额百分之八十。黑龙江省绥化县六合村农民在订出增产捐献计划之后，仅在增加铲趟和多施肥方面，就可能多打粮食九十石。锦州市福生合号从改善经营管理着手，下半年的盈利可比上半年增加百分之八十左右。这些事实可以说明，订立与执行增产捐献计划，对于保证完成捐献任务，推进各项建设事业有着怎样巨大的意义。可是，也有这样一种情况，即各地有一些工人、学生、教职员要节省了他们的饭费，减低了他们的生活水平，或将他们自己的衣物用来捐献，这种高度的爱国主义的热情是很好的，是应该受到表扬的，但我们用不着以节衣缩食的办法来捐献，主要应该以增加生产增加收入来增加捐献。
    为着普遍发动群众来订立增产捐献计划，首先必须做好宣传教育工作，向所有的人民群众说明订立增产捐献计划对于支援前线、巩固国防和对于推进生产建设的意义，并说明增产捐献必须依靠每个人高度发挥爱国的积极性，大家来想办法，确定具体的目标，并有计划、有步骤地去达到这个目标。
    由于领导机关和人民群众对于订立增加生产和增加收入的捐献计划都缺乏经验，各地区各单位可以采用培养典型、取得经验、推动全面的办法。辽西省锦州市和北京市工商界都因为采用这个方法，推动了工作。这些经验可供各地参考。
    再次，较大范围的增产捐献计划一定要有基层单位群众的计划来保证，才是确实可以实现的，才不致落空。黑龙江省绥化县六合村首先发动全村群众，想出各个人自己的增产捐献办法，订出互助组与个人的增产捐献计划，然后集中起来订出全村的计划。这种计划是踏实的，是有实现的保证的。全国各地都必须这样做。
    为了保证增产捐献计划的实现，必须把捐献计划的主要内容订入爱国公约，并建立定期的检查制度。只有这样，才能随时了解捐献计划执行的情况，发现和推广成功的经验，并发现和解决运动中发生的各种问题。否则，捐献计划纵然订得很好，也可能流于形式。
