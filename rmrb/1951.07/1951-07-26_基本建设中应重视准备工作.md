　　Importance of Preparatory Work in Basic Construction
    "Industrial Technology Communications" Editorial Department
    Editor's Note: In order to further discuss the issue of "Construction is impossible without correct engineering design" raised by this newspaper, the editorial department of "Industrial Technology Communications" invited thirteen comrades engaged in industrial construction to hold a symposium. This article is the opinions put forward by everyone at the symposium, compiled by the editorial department of the journal and submitted to this newspaper for publication. "Industrial Technology Communications" is one of the excellent reading materials for junior technicians and technical workers in the industrial sector. It was founded on October 1, 1949, originally named "Science and Technology Communications," and changed to its current name on January 15, 1951. Readers are welcome to actively participate in the discussion of the issues raised in this article.
  Shortcomings in Basic Construction
    We believe that the following shortcomings exist in the past basic construction work:
    (1) Most of the losses in our basic construction work occur in civil engineering construction. Generally speaking, civil engineering construction often accounts for 40% to 50% of the entire basic construction project, so it is worthy of our attention. The reason is that China lacks experienced factory design engineers, and most engineers have only done residential design; but even such engineers are few in number. On the other hand, many of the losses in civil engineering are due to insufficient attention to foundation engineering. For example, the house itself is not damaged, but the foundation sinks, the bottom of the steam hammer and boiler sinks, and so on. Poor foundation engineering is mostly due to lack of investigation and research, geological drilling; irresponsible supervision; improper mixing ratio of sand, cement, and gravel; incorrect use of steel bar ratio; and subcontracting at all levels. The state's money is spent, but when it is used for actual projects, it has been greatly reduced. Therefore, if these projects were carried out according to the design, they could have been done well, but losses were caused due to insufficient subjective effort.
    (2) Some cadres have a dilatory and perfunctory attitude towards the implementation of the Interim Measures for the Basic Construction Work Procedures formulated by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council. The higher authorities stipulated that it must be done according to the procedure, otherwise no money would be given, so they had to make do. Therefore, the preliminary design and technical design done from this "perfunctory point of view" will certainly have a big discount on the actual situation. As for the detailed construction drawings, according to the regulations, they are made in the factory and are not sent to the higher authorities for review separately; from the perspective of coping, it is easier to take it lightly and perfunctory. Therefore, attaching importance to work procedures should become one of the important educational tasks in our future basic construction work.
    (3) In basic construction, building materials cannot yet achieve unified standard specifications, unified material inspection, and unified engineering standards; design work cannot be carried out on a certain quota. Each has its own school of thought, each has its own reference numbers, which are poorly combined with various actual conditions, and there is no standard.
    Basic construction work is a delicate scientific work and planning and organization work. Often, "a miss is as good as a mile" affects the overall situation. Therefore, a sound system must be established and thoroughly implemented into every specific work of design and construction in order to ensure quality and complete the task.
  We must pay attention to preparation work and use the system to ensure the execution of preparation work
    "Construction is impossible without correct engineering design" is part of the basic construction problem. Basic construction must first determine the policy, factory production capacity, nature, variety, resources, and then consider the site, transportation, market needs, and a series of exploration and investigation work. Therefore, only by doing the preparation work in the first stage can it be possible to carry out correct engineering design, and only then can it be possible to construct without causing failure.
    The failure of some existing basic construction work is due to insufficient preparation in the previous stage, uncertain policies, immature considerations, and rash construction. Therefore, when the policy changes or there are other reasons, it will cause a lot of losses.
    Assuming that a factory is built, and there are no defects in terms of technical construction and other conditions, but it lacks economic and political significance, this factory should not be included in the successful experience. Although it has completed the general engineering design, it does not have a comprehensive policy and a global view of industrial distribution, etc. This design should be incomplete.
    Assuming that the factory building is completed, but soon the phenomenon of tilting occurs due to the unconsolidated stratum. From the perspective of the building conditions, it may fully meet the specifications and standards, but because there is a lack of geological drilling work in advance, this design is also incomplete.
    Therefore, design is a very important part of basic construction. Correct design includes many conditions, the most important of which is to do a series of preparation work.
    Failure to pay attention to the preparation work before the design will inevitably lead to failure. However, there are still many comrades engaged in industrial work, or even some leading comrades, who do not have a clear understanding of this issue. The source is several wrong ideas in basic construction:
    The first is a local point of view: It is manifested in the lack of an overall planning view of industrial construction, being fond of greatness and eager for quick success, and blindly constructing when objective conditions (human, material, and financial resources) are insufficient. Thinking that more money is easier to handle, lacking a realistic and meticulous attitude, the project increases or decreases according to the amount of money, rather than making plans based on a certain purpose. Failing to deeply understand the high degree of organization and planning of modern industry. Relying only on subjective estimates, without making scientific plans and statistics, emphasizing the current production needs, or fantasizing about overly distant future needs, and lacking a correct development perspective.
    The second is the lack of a responsible attitude towards the people. The designer only considers his own convenience and does not consider the construction conditions. The constructor constructs according to the design and does not reflect the actual situation. For example, when the entire project is nearing completion, it is discovered that the stress calculation of the beam frame is wrong, or the water volume of the drain pipe and the water supply pipe is inconsistent. The designer only relies on a piece of paper and does not actually investigate; although it seems to be responsible in form, it is actually a kind of employment thinking, which is the working attitude of the old society.
    Based on the above situation, we unanimously believe that the basic method to overcome these shortcomings is to attach importance to preparation work. Without preparation work, there will be no correct engineering design, and construction will be impossible. Any other objective reason cannot negate this basic working principle.
    In order to correct mistakes, we must establish a written system for basic construction. This year, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council discussed this issue at the February Industrial Conference, and then promulgated the Interim Regulations on Basic Construction Procedures, which played a great role in turning the basic construction work into a regular path.
  How to strengthen basic construction work
    In order to do a good job in future basic construction work, we believe that:
    (1) We must strengthen the idea of economic accounting in basic construction. This has been clearly put forward in the summary of basic construction in Northeast China in 1950. Economic accounting system is the independent operation of basic construction enterprises under planned management. It can overcome the view of blindly building without a plan and operating with one's own money. It can strengthen the planning view and overcome the wrong ideas of not paying attention to preparation work and starting from the local. At the same time, it can also correct the supply system thinking.
    (2) Designers should be used in a centralized manner. The state can establish design institutions and make unified standard designs (such as dormitories, offices, etc.). This not only saves manpower, but also facilitates planning. The government should guide and supervise design institutions that may be prone to rough manufacturing due to "large-scale contracting," and correct the "starization" tendency of architectural design engineers.
    (3) We must abolish subcontracting at all levels and feudalistic boss organizations. Only by doing a good job in political work, raising workers' awareness, and carrying out mass quality assurance and in-depth inspection work can basic construction work truly enter a sound state. The idea that construction workers are "small workers" and are purely physical laborers must be corrected. This is a political work issue, and also a mass viewpoint and a viewpoint of relying on the working class.
    (4) Strengthen the reporting work of basic construction, grasp the progress through reports, and check in time. Check achievements, check shortcomings, and summarize experience. The idea that reporting is a burden is wrong. Cadres must be educated that blind basic construction is more loss-making than production, because this is a "century-old plan" career, and even small mistakes will cause long-term losses.
    (5) Gradually stipulate engineering standards and technical quotas for various designs (such as how much money, how much labor, how much wood, and how much steel are required for one square meter of dormitory). Only by gradually stipulating such quotas can the budget be reviewed. Otherwise, a basic construction project will propose 20 billion yuan for a while, and then propose 30 billion yuan for a while. This method of "taking the money and talking about it" is very inappropriate. Similarly, we must gradually stipulate some basic items that must be filled in. Filling in these items is the most basic condition for design. In addition, what procedures should the design itself go through for approval, what should be reviewed, and how should the conditions of the designers be determined, should also be clearly stipulated; otherwise, it will form a situation where problems cannot be seen and only approval is possible.
  Our conclusion
    The result of our discussion is that solving ideological problems and establishing necessary systems are the two main methods to improve basic construction work. Objective difficulties can be overcome. We should admit difficulties, but we must never bow to difficulties. We should face up to the call of "sitting in glass windows" and be wary of the bad tendency of guiding work to deviate from the actual situation of the site. But it cannot be used as a reason to cover up shortcomings.
    The result of our discussion is that the achievements made in basic construction under the correct leadership of the central government are the main aspect, and these achievements should be affirmed. But on the other hand, the shortcomings in basic construction work in various places, whether in design or construction, are still numerous. Judging from the examples published in the People's Daily, there are already many; if an in-depth and comprehensive basic construction inspection is carried out, many similar or more serious shortcomings or errors will be found. These errors or shortcomings are intolerable. We believe that the exposure of errors is not equal to "erasing the achievements with one stroke," but is a necessary condition for consolidating and improving the achievements already made, and at the same time, it can lay a good foundation for large-scale construction in the future.
    We believe that the call of "Construction is impossible without correct engineering design" is correct. At the same time, we believe that a series of preparation work is a necessary step for correct engineering design. The former and the latter are an inseparable whole. The above opinions are welcome to participate in the discussion.

　　基本建设中应重视准备工作
    “工业技术通讯”编辑部
    编者按：《工业技术通讯》编辑部为了进一步地讨论本报所提出的“没有正确的工程设计就不可能施工”这一问题，曾邀请十三位从事工业建设工作的同志举行了座谈会。此文就是这个座谈会上大家提出的意见，由该刊编辑部整理出来交本报发表。按，《工业技术通讯》是工业部门初级技术人员和技术工人的优良读物之一，于一九四九年十月一日创刊，原名《科学技术通讯》，于一九五一年一月十五日起改为现在的名称。对本文所提出的问题，希望读者热烈参加讨论。
  基本建设中的缺点
    我们认为过去基本建设工作中存在着下列几种缺点：
    （一）我们基本建设工作的损失，大部分是在土木建筑工程方面发生问题。一般说来，土木建筑工程往往占整个基本建设工程的百分之四十到五十，所以值得我们重视。究其原因，一方面：中国缺少有经验的工厂设计工程师，大部分工程师只是做过住宅设计；但即使这样的工程师，人数也很少。另一方面：土木建筑方面的损失，很多是对于基础工程注意不够。例如：房子本身没有坏，而地基下陷，汽锤、锅炉的底脚下陷等等。基础工程不好，多由于没有调查研究、进行地质钻探；监工不负责；沙、水泥、石子混合的比例不恰当；钢筋比例使用不正确；施工层层转包，国家的钱是花了，但用至实际工程时，已经大为削减。所以说，这些工程如按设计进行，本来是可以做好的，但是因主观努力不够，因而造成损失。
    （二）对政务院财政经济委员会所制定的基本建设工作程序暂行办法的执行，有若干干部有拖沓应付的思想。上级规定要按程序办，不办不给钱，所以只好凑合着办。因此，从这种“应付观点”下所做的初步设计、技术设计，当然对实际的情况会有很大的折扣。至于施工详图，按规定是在工厂中做的，不另送上级审核；从应付观点去看，那就更容易等闲视之，草率马虎。因此，重视工作程序，应成为我们今后基本建设工作中的重要教育工作之一。
    （三）基本建设中，建筑材料还不能做到统一的标准规格，统一的材料检验，和统一的工程标准；设计工作就不可能在一定定额上进行设计。各有学派，各有自己的参考数字，跟各种实际条件结合很差，漫无标准。
    基本建设工作，是一个细腻的科学工作和计划组织工作。往往因为“失之毫厘”就牵动全局。所以必须建立健全的制度，深入贯彻到设计、施工的每一项具体工作中去，才能够保证质量，完成任务。
  必须重视准备工作，用制度来保证准备工作的执行
    “没有正确的工程设计，就不可能施工”，这是基本建设问题的一部分。基本建设首先要确定方针、工厂生产能力、性质、品种、资源，从而考虑厂址、交通运输、市场需要，以及一系列的勘察、调查工作。所以只有做好前一段的准备工作，才有可能进行正确的工程设计，也才有可能施工而不招致失败。
    现有某些基本建设工作的失败，是由于前一部分准备工作不足，方针不确定，考虑不成熟，而就贸然进行施工。因此当方针改变，或有其他原因时，就造成很多损失。
    假设修建一个工厂，从技术施工等条件来说，并没有任何缺陷，但它缺乏经济的和政治的正确意义，这个工厂就不应列入成功的经验。虽然他完成了一般工程设计，但是他没有全面的方针，和工业分布等等的全局观点，这个设计应是不完整的。
    假设工厂厂房修盖完成，但不久因地层不坚固，发生倾斜的现象，从房屋的修建条件来说，可能全部合乎规格标准，但因事前缺乏地质钻探的工作，这个设计也是不完整的。
    因此设计是基本建设极重要的一环。正确的设计，包括很多条件，最主要的是要做好一系列的准备工作。
    不重视设计前一段的准备工作，必然会造成失败。但是还有很多从事工业工作的同志，甚或一部分领导同志，对这个问题的认识不够明确。其来源是基本建设中的几种错误思想：
    首先是局部观点：表现在缺少从工业建设的整体的计划观点，好大喜功，急于求成，客观条件（人力、物力、财力）不足，就盲目施工。认为钱多好办事，缺乏实事求是、精打细算的态度，工程随钱的多少而增减，而不是根据一定的目的做计划。不深刻认识现代工业的高度组织性和计划性。只凭主观估计，而不作科学的计划与统计，强调目前生产需要，或空想过分遥远的将来的需要，而缺少正确的发展观点。
    其次是缺少对人民负责的态度。设计的只顾自己方便，不考虑施工条件。施工的按设计施工，不反映实际情况。如整个工程已接近完成时，才发现梁架应力的计算错误，或如排水管与送水管的水量不一致，设计者只凭一纸之辞，没有实际去勘察；虽在形式上好像还负责，但实际上却是一种雇佣思想，是旧社会的工作态度。
    根据上述情况，我们一致认为：克服这些缺点的基本方法，就是重视准备工作。没有准备工作，就不会有正确的工程设计，就不可能施工。任何其他客观原因，都不可能否定这个基本的工作原则。
    为了纠正错误，我们必须建立基本建设的成文的制度。本年政务院财政经济委员会，在二月工业会议上讨论了这个问题，并且随即颁布了基本建设程序的暂行条例，这条例使基本建设工作逐步地走入正规起了很大的扭转作用。
  如何加强基本建设工作
    为了做好今后基本建设工作，我们认为：
    （一）必须加强基本建设的经济核算思想。这在东北一九五○年基本建设总结中已明确提出。经济核算制是计划管理下基本建设企业的独立经营。它可以克服没有计划，自己有钱自己经营的盲目兴建的观点。它可以加强计划观点，克服不重视准备工作和从局部出发的错误思想。同时也可以纠正供给制思想。
    （二）设计人员应集中使用。国家可建立设计机构，并统一作出标准设计（如宿舍、办公室等）。这样不仅节省人力，同时也有利于计划。对“大宗包揽”而可能发生粗制滥造偏向的设计机构，要由政府予以指导监督，纠正建筑设计工程师的“明星化”倾向。
    （三）必须废除层层转包，及封建性的把头组织。只有做好政治工作，提高工人觉悟，开展群众性的保证质量深入检查的工作，才有可能使得基本建设工作真正地进入健全的境地。认为建筑工人是“小工”，是单纯体力劳动者的思想，必须纠正。这是一个政治工作问题，也是群众观点、依靠工人阶级观点的问题。
    （四）加强基本建设的表报工作，通过表报，掌握进度，及时检查。检查成绩、检查缺点、总结经验。认为表报是一种负担的思想，是错误的。必须教育干部，盲目的基本建设，比生产的损失大，因为这是“百年大计”的事业，那怕是小小的错误，都会造成长期的损失。
    （五）逐步规定工程标准，和各种设计的技术定额（如一平方公尺宿舍需多少钱、多少人工、多少木料、多少钢料等）。只有逐步规定了这种定额，才可能审核预算。否则一个基本建设，一会儿提出要二百亿元，一会儿又提出要三百亿元，这种“拿了钱再说”的办法是极不妥当的。同样的，我们也必须逐步规定一些必须填写的基础项目，填了这些项目，就是设计的最基础的条件。此外设计本身经过什么手续批准，审查什么，设计人员的条件如何决定，也应该明确规定；否则，便会形成看不出问题，只好批准。
  我们的结论
    我们讨论的结果，认为解决思想问题和建立必要的制度，是健全基本建设工作的两个主要的方法。客观的困难，是可以克服的，应该承认困难，但决不可向困难低头。我们应该正视“坐在玻璃窗内”的呼声，警惕指导工作脱离现场实际的不良倾向。但是也不能引为理由，掩饰缺点。
    我们讨论的结果，认为在中央正确的领导下，基本建设获得的成绩，是主要的一面，这些成绩应予肯定。但在另一方面，各地的基本建设工作，无论在设计或施工上的缺点还很多。从人民日报上已公布的例子来看，已经不少；如果经过一次深入的全面的基本建设检查，一定会发现许多类似或更严重的缺点或错误。这些错误或缺点是不能容忍的。我们认为：对于错误的揭发，不等于“一笔抹煞了成绩”，反而是巩固与提高既得成绩的必要条件，同时更可以打下将来大规模建设的良好基础。
    我们认为“没有正确的工程设计，就不可能施工”的号召是正确的。同时我们更认为一系列的准备工作，是正确的工程设计的必要步骤。前者与后者是不可分割的整体。以上意见，还请大家参加讨论。
