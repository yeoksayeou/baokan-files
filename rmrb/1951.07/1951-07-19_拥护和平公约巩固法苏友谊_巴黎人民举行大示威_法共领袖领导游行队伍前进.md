Xinhua News Agency, July 17th, dispatch from TASS, Paris, July 15th: On July 14th, hundreds of thousands of people in Paris celebrated French National Day—the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille during the French Revolution. On this day, Paris held a grand peace demonstration, with the participation of more than fifty democratic groups.

Leading the march were members of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, headed by Duclos. Fascist thugs, in an attempt to disrupt the march, threw a tear gas canister at the feet of Duclos and Cachin. The marchers immediately caught the provocateur, but the police quickly came to the rescue and drove him away in a car.

The procession proceeded from the Place de la Bastille to the Place de la Nation, and was warmly welcomed by the residents of Paris along the way. Slogans resounded everywhere: "Support the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact!" "Support friendship with the Soviet Union!" "Oppose the Korean War!" "Oppose the Vietnam War!" "Release peace fighter Henri Martin!"

Standing on the rostrum of the Place de la Nation were leaders of the National Peace Council, the French Communist Party, and other democratic organizations. The contingents of the General Confederation of Labor, the French Women's Union, and former guerrillas marched past the rostrum in succession. A team of reserve officers, led by General Petit, marched past in orderly steps. The "Friends of the Commune" marched past, holding a banner that read: "The descendants of the Paris Commune will never fight against the victorious socialist country!" The heroine Raymonda Dien, who bravely fought for peace, led the contingent of the French Young Women's Union. The young women held up a banner that read: "Casanova's country will never fight against Tan's country!"

Amidst warm applause, the delegation of the British Peace Committee, headed by Mrs. Politt, also marched past the rostrum in the ranks of the French people. The British workers held up banners that read: "British democrats are with you in the struggle for peace!" "We will never fight against the fortress of peace, the Soviet Union!" The contingent of the French Republican Youth Union and the contingent of Algerian workers in Paris marched past the rostrum singing the Democratic Youth March. They carried signs that read: "French people, help us destroy the Bastille of colonial rule!" "We want independence!"

This grand march and demonstration by the workers of Paris is the best answer to the warmongers who are trying to turn France into a bridgehead for attacking the camp of peace and democracy. The freedom-loving French people have expressed with new strength their will for peace, their will to support the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact, and their will to consolidate friendship with the Soviet Union.

　　拥护和平公约巩固法苏友谊
　  巴黎人民举行大示威
　  法共领袖领导游行队伍前进
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十五日讯：七月十四日，巴黎有数十万人庆祝法国国庆节——法国革命时攻占巴斯底狱的纪念日。这一天，巴黎举行了盛大的和平示威，参加的有五十多个民主团体。
    走在游行队伍的最前面的，是以杜克洛为首的法国共产党中央委员会的委员们。法西斯暴徒为了破坏游行，把一个催泪瓦斯瓶投在杜克洛与加香的脚下。游行者当场抓住了这个挑衅的家伙，但是警察连忙赶来营救，把他用汽车送走了。
    游行队伍从巴斯底广场向国民广场进发，沿途受到巴黎居民的热烈欢迎。到处响遍了这样的口号：“拥护缔结五大国和平公约！”“拥护对苏友好！”“反对朝鲜战争！”“反对越南战争！”“释放和平战士亨利·马丁！”
    国民广场的主席台上站着全国和平理事会、法国共产党和其他民主组织的领袖。法国总工会、法兰西妇女联盟和前游击队员的队伍，相继走过主席台。以柏蒂将军为首的一队后备军官以整齐的步伐走过去了。“公社之友”的队伍高举着“巴黎公社的子孙决不与胜利了的社会主义国家作战！”的标语，走过去了。英勇地为和平而斗争的女英雄雷蒙达·第安率领着法兰西女青年联盟的队伍。女青年们举着这样的标语：“卡萨诺娃的国家决不对丹娘的国家作战！”
    在人们热烈的掌声中，以波立特夫人为首的英国和平委员会代表团也在法国人民的行列中走过主席台。英国的劳动者高举着这样的标语：“英国的民主分子和你们一道争取和平！”“我们决不与和平的堡垒苏联作战！”法兰西共和青年联盟的队伍和在巴黎的阿尔及利亚工人的队伍唱着民主青年进行曲走过主席台。他们打着这样的标语牌：“法国人，援助我们摧毁殖民统治的巴斯底狱！”“我们要独立！”
    巴黎劳动者这次盛大的游行示威，对于企图把法国变为进攻和平与民主阵营的桥头堡的战争贩子们，乃是一个最好的回答。爱好自由的法国人民以新的力量表示了自己希望和平的意志，表示了自己拥护缔结五大国和平公约的意志，表示了自己要巩固同苏联的友谊的意志。
