  III. Others
    1.  The Unity and Transformation of Technical Personnel

    The majority of our Chinese technical personnel lived in the old society for a long time, and a few had political stains. Most of them are now willing to serve the people. Uniting the broad masses of technical personnel to serve the construction of the new China is a very important task.

    Currently, much of the work in uniting technical personnel is correct. However, in some areas, there are two deviations. One is rightist, that is, relying unconditionally on old technical personnel. Whatever the engineers want to do, they do. In general, it means tailing after the old technical personnel. The other is complete distrust of old technical personnel and supervisors, even refusing to consult with workers on any engineering plans, acting as an amateur while insisting on making decisions arbitrarily and recklessly.

    Many of our veteran comrades have experience and methods in military work, mass work, and organizational work, but they are amateurs when it comes to technical work. If they act recklessly, they are bound to fail. It is like playing chess without seeing two or three steps ahead, making it easy to lose. Old technical personnel have a set of methods in technology and old management practices. While they have many shortcomings in other aspects, their management methods and technology are worth critically accepting; they cannot be completely written off.

    I believe that the best method at present is for the old technical personnel to command the "battle" on the engineering front, while the political leaders grasp policy, decide plans, and prevent deviations. For each project, technical personnel should create a plan, and political leaders should organize workers and supervisors to participate in discussions and revisions to make a decision, which is then handed over to the technical personnel for execution. At the same time, workers should be mobilized to ensure the completion of the plan, and the plan should be monitored to prevent deviations.

    Old technical personnel, as long as they are not politically reactionary, should be resolutely united and transformed. We should avoid a purely utilitarian perspective. On the other hand, we should also avoid the phenomenon of unconditional obedience and following orders blindly.

    2.  The Foreman System

    The foreman system has mostly been abolished in state-owned construction companies, but disguised foreman systems still exist in some places. There are roughly three forms of disguised foreman systems: one is the "tiger team." The "tiger team" is essentially a form where workers organize themselves to contract for work, with the contracted money "divided equally among the group," which is essentially a "piece-rate wage system," also called a small-scale contract system, which is good in itself. However, because workers often lack the ability to estimate work and have no fixed organization, it is easy for foremen to exploit them.

    Another is the bonus system, which stipulates that a certain project should be completed in a certain number of workdays, for example, fifty workdays. If it is actually completed in only forty workdays, a percentage of the remaining ten workdays can be given as a bonus. If the percentage is 100%, it is essentially a piece-rate wage. This method is sometimes exploited by foremen as mentioned above.

    The most serious problem with piece-rate wages is the issue of quality standards because standards are not easy to set. When workers' awareness is not high enough, there is often a situation of cutting corners.

    The third is that when the company needs workers, it often asks old foremen to find them on their behalf. These foremen often act as temporary supervisors during construction. Although wages are paid directly to the workers, the workers, for the convenience of finding work next time, often give the foremen some "straw sandal money" whenever the foremen say, "I wore out several pairs of shoes finding work for you." Another is the kitchen group. When workers work in the suburbs, and it is necessary to start their own kitchen, the foremen often use relatives and friends to manage the food, skimming off the profits.

    When we first entered Tangshan City, we started to organize construction workers, attempting to establish production cooperatives, but we were unsuccessful. It was not until this year that we finally organized them. Experience has shown that organizing construction worker production cooperatives under the correct leadership of the cooperative's headquarters is a good way to avoid exploitation by foremen. The cooperatives can also unite a large number of non-members, providing free job referrals for them. However, some comrades view the issue from non-principle issues such as too little capital (worker cooperatives do not need investment from capitalists, so the capital must be small) and too few technical personnel, failing to recognize from a policy perspective that this is a collective economic organization of workers themselves that is worth vigorously cultivating.

    3.  Objective Difficulties in Capital Construction

    Comrade Chen Yougong raised some objective difficulties in carrying out capital construction in the second edition of the People's Daily on July 10th, and his arguments are very inappropriate. Just because we have many objective difficulties does not mean we must make mistakes. The focus of the People's Daily editorial on June 16th is on strengthening design work, and the importance of design work and the importance of construction work cannot be denied. "Careless design" is one of the objective difficulties, and the People's Daily is calling on us to overcome this difficulty. The existence of objective difficulties often has objective reasons for their existence, such as "urgent time and lack of manpower." However, overcoming all interdependent objective difficulties is the direction of our efforts. In summary: "Construction is impossible without correct engineering design." Otherwise, it will lead to failure.

    On the other hand, the objective difficulties mentioned by Comrade Chen Yougong do exist. Some of them need to be overcome jointly by departments outside of the capital construction departments, such as delivering tasks in advance and approving preliminary and final accounts in a timely manner.

    If a large project requires three months for design, two months for reviewing the design and approving the budget, and one month for preparing materials and organizing construction, then it is best to deliver the task half a year in advance. Some comrades may think that this requirement is too high, but facts tell us that some large tasks are decided hastily and completed quickly. Some projects have been completed, but the budget has not yet been approved. Some projects have already spent borrowed money, but the budget has been reduced, and the person in charge has to recover the used funds from the workers or contractors.

    A relatively large task, due to the development of objective circumstances and the involvement of many aspects, often cannot be decided quickly, or if it is decided quickly, construction must be carried out quickly, often causing people engaged in capital construction to encounter many difficulties. This phenomenon is worth bringing up for everyone to pay attention to and overcome. "Deliver tasks in advance and approve plans and preliminary and final accounts quickly." This should be put forward as a slogan here.

  IV. Suggestion to Establish a "General Construction Administration"

    It is suggested that the Central People's Government establish a General Construction Administration to lead civil engineering and other capital construction and local urban construction. The reasons are as follows:

    1.  For the sake of implementing unified leadership

    Due to the lack of "General Construction Administration, branch administrations" and other agencies to lead urban construction at the central and provincial levels, the staff feels that they have no reliance in their work, which will weaken the planned nature of new democratic construction. If the construction is completed and becomes unsuitable after a few years, it is a pity to demolish it. Since urban construction expenditures account for 30% to 50% or more of the city's expenditures, the losses are great if it is done poorly.

    Some people say that our country has not yet reached a peak in urban construction. The Soviet Union also established a "Ministry of Urban Construction" only after World War II, when it had to restore many cities destroyed in the war. However, construction is a long-term plan. We now feel that some of the houses built in the past need to be demolished. Therefore, it is always better to do the work in an organized and planned way in advance, rather than waiting until the future to demolish the houses we are building now.

    In addition, the current capital construction is led by various units, which is always less economical in terms of manpower and material resources than unified leadership and centralized deployment.

    The regulation that all projects must have detailed plans and charts submitted to the Financial and Economic Committee before funds can be allocated can only solve the problem of having engineering designs; to solve the problem of "correct" engineering design and construction, excellent technical personnel should be concentrated in the "General Construction Administration" for review and guidance. The greatest benefit is that it can avoid the serious waste of using more labor and materials and not seeking economy and efficiency as mentioned above.

    2.  Formulate Engineering Codes

    Engineering must have standard codes suitable for national conditions for easy design and construction, to avoid those who studied in Germany saying that German regulations require this, and those who studied in the United States saying that American regulations require that, and it should be our own regulations on how to do it.

    Engineering codes are not dead things and can be modified based on new successful experiences. However, the engineers who are legally authorized to change the regulations must be certain chartered engineers and research institutions with significant achievements in theory and experience. They should also report the reasons for the changes, the construction process, and the results after completion to the "General Construction Administration" in detail to accumulate experience and improve the codes. When an individual believes that "I have never laid a foundation when building houses for my fellow villagers" and therefore refuses to implement any of the code's clauses, it should be considered illegal construction.

        3.  Testing of Domestic Materials

    The performance of domestic materials should be tested and announced for everyone to use, to avoid waste. For example, our country has always made rammed earth in the same old way, without understanding the specifics. This time, Tianjin University published the results of its ten years of testing, which is very valuable. However, if various different methods can be tested, and it is pointed out whether it is necessary to improve the current construction methods, the guiding role for practice will be even greater.

    Currently, some engineers do not like to use domestic materials, which is wrong. In the testing of domestic materials, the advantages and disadvantages of their performance should be pointed out, and manufacturers should be advised to improve their methods. Engineers should be told how to master the performance of the materials so that the construction results can be good.

        4.  Formulate Standard Drawings

    Standard drawings can be formulated for reference by various technical workers. This approach can solve some of the problems of a lack of theoretical technical personnel in our country. With standard drawings, general supervisors can do some design work that is better than without them.

    Comrades from the Harbin Municipal Construction Bureau have worked hard in this direction, which is a correct direction facing the masses.

    However, organized and systematic work in this area requires unified leadership.

        5.  Define Material Standards

    Currently, there are no material standards, such as for radiator fins, where sizes vary greatly, and prices differ greatly, so there is no standard for calculating heat release, resulting in waste and causing difficulties in design and construction. Standard specifications should be researched and formulated for use.

    6.  Investigate Work Rates and Develop Towards Mechanization

    At present, civil engineering and construction projects still have a large component of handicraft industry, so the standards for estimating labor and materials are very inconsistent, resulting in confusion in preliminary and final accounts. It is necessary to investigate the actual quantities of labor and materials used in various projects under various circumstances.

    In the future, more new machines should be designed to replace manual labor to enhance work efficiency and quality.

  V. Conclusion

    I have been working and studying in the "technical field" for more than ten years. In recent years, I have gained some experience, mainly from hitting snags. Generally speaking, things that go smoothly pass by quickly, and nothing can be grasped. The harder you hit a snag, the greater the harvest. I have many perceptual understandings that I want to write down. Although I summarize every month and year, I am never satisfied. This time, by studying and delving into the theory of practice, I discovered the key areas and wanted to write them down. The theory of practice tells me that this is exactly a process of practice: first, you have perceptual knowledge in your work, and you want to summarize it, but repeated summaries are never satisfactory. Or rather, that is exactly the practice of making summaries. Then, after studying, you deepen your understanding, and then you write this article. In the eyes of people with richer perceptual knowledge and stronger summarization ability than me, it may seem unsatisfactory. If I continue to progress in the future, I will revise it because I am not satisfied. This is the "theory of practice" learned from practice.

    Our wise Chairman Mao is guiding us forward in all aspects, pointing out our shortcomings, and prescribing the right remedy. For scientific and technical workers, this remedy is equally effective. Every scientific and technical worker must study Mao Zedong Thought, properly digest and absorb it, to improve themselves.

  三、其他
    一  技术人员的团结改造问题
    我们中国大多数的技术人员，曾长期生活在旧社会，有少数人在政治上有过污点。他们绝大部分现在都愿意为人民服务。团结广大技术人员为新中国的建设服务，是很重要的任务。
    目前在团结技术人员的工作上，有许多地方是正确的。但有些地方，则有两种偏向，一种是右的，即一切无条件依靠旧技术人员。工程师要怎么办，就怎么办。总起来说是作了旧技术人员的尾巴。另一种是完全不信任旧技术人员与监工，甚至一切工程计划也不与工人商量，自己是外行，但要独断独行地蛮干。
    我们许多老同志在军事工作、群众工作、组织工作上有经验、有办法，但对于技术工作却是外行，如果蛮干，一定失败。就像不能先看两三步棋的人，下棋易于失败一样。旧技术人员在技术上与旧的管理方法上有一套办法，在其他方面有很多缺点，但旧技术人员的这一套管理方法与技术，值得我们批判接受，不能一概抹煞。
    我以为在目前最好的方法是，旧技术人员指挥工程上的“战斗”，而政治上的领导干部则掌握政策，决定计划，防止偏差。每一个工程都由技术人员作出计划，由政治上的领导干部组织工人、监工参加讨论修改，作出决定，然后交由技术人员执行，并发动工人保证该计划的完成，并掌握计划，使不生偏差。
    旧技术人员，只要在政治上不是反动的，我们应坚决团结改造他们，应避免单纯使用观点。另方面也要避免毫无原则、唯命是从的现象。
    二  把头制问题
    把头制，在国营建筑公司中多已取消，但变象把头制则有的仍然存在。变象把头制现在大致有三种形式：一种是老虎班。老虎班本是工人自己组织起来包工，“大伙平分”包工钱的一种形式，亦即“计件工资制”，又叫小包制，这本是很好的。但由于工人多不会估活，没有固定组织，这样就容易被把头钻进来剥削工人。
    另一种是奖励制，亦即规定某工程几个工作完，例如五十个工。如果实际只四十个工作完了，所余的十个工可提百分之几作为奖励，如果所提部分是百分之百，实即计件工资了，此法有时为把头利用有如上述。
    计件工资中最严重的问题还是质量标准问题，因为标准不易定，在工人觉悟程度不够的时候，往往发生偷工情形。
    第三种是，由于公司要工人时，多通过旧把头代找，施工时往往由他们任临时监工；虽然工资直接发到工人手里，但工人为了下次找工便利，每当把头说“为你们找工，鞋都跑破了几双”时，大伙便送几个“草鞋钱”给他。再一种是锅伙，工人在郊外工作，有必要自己起伙时，把头往往用亲戚朋友来代管伙食，从中揩油。
    在我们初进唐山市时，即着手组织建筑工人，企图成立生产合作社，但未成功。延至今年始组织成了。经验证明，在合作总社的正确领导下组织建筑工人生产合作社，是避免把头剥削的好方法；合作社并可团结大批非社员，为非社员义务介绍工作。但有个别的同志，从资本太小（工人合作社不要资本家的投资，资本一定是小）、技术人员太少等非原则性的问题上看问题，不从政策上认识这是一个值得大力培植的工人们自己的集体性的经济组织。
    三  基本建设中的客观困难问题
    陈有功同志在七月十日的人民日报第二版上提出了一些进行基本建设时的客观困难，其论点是很不妥当的。我们有很多客观困难不等于必须错误。人民日报六月十六日社论的重点在加强设计工作，而设计工作的重要性与施工工作的重要性是不能否认的。“设计草率”，是客观困难之一，人民日报正号召我们去克服这一困难。客观困难之所以存在，往往有他存在的客观原因。例如“时间又急，人手缺乏”等。但克服一切互为因果的客观困难，是我们努力的方向。总起来讲：“没有正确的工程设计还是不可能施工。”否则就要招致失败。
    另方面，陈有功同志所说的客观困难确实存在。有一些是要进行基本建设部门以外的部门来共同克服的。例如提前交待任务，及时批准预决算等。
    如果一个大工程，设计需要三个月，审核设计、批准预算需要两个月，准备材料组织施工需要一个月的话，那么最好在半年前就把任务交待下来。这样的要求，有的同志也许认为太高，但事实告诉我们：有的大任务是仓卒决定，火速完成的。有的工程已完，而预算尚未批准的。有的工程钱已借着花了，但预算核减了，还要经手人从工人或包商手中追回已用的款项。
    一个比较大的任务，由于客观情况发展，由于多方面的牵连，往往是不能迅速决定，或迅速决定了又要火速施工，往往使从事基本建设的人遇到很多困难。这现象是值得提出来，大家注意克服的。“提前交待任务，迅速批准计划及预决算。”在这儿应该当一个口号提出来。
  四、建议成立“建设总署”
    建议中央人民政府设立建设总署，领导土木建筑等基本建设和地方城市建设。其理由于下：
    一  为了实行统一领导
    由于城市建设在中央、省没有“建设总署、分署”之类的机关领导，使工作人员，感到在工作中无依靠，这样会削弱新民主主义建设的计划性。如果建设完了，等到若干年后不合用，拆之又可惜。由于城市建设经费占市开支的百分之三十到百分之五十以上，如果作坏了，损失是很大的。
    有人说目前我国未达城市建设高潮，苏联也是第二次大战以后，要恢复很多战争中破坏了的城市才设立“城市建设部”的。但建设是百年大计，我们现在已觉得过去盖的房子有些要拆掉，因此，提前有组织有计划地作工作总是好一些，不要等到将来拆现在盖的房子。
    另外，目前的基本建设分由各单位领导，总是不如统一领导、集中调配来得节省人力物力。
    一切工程必须有详细计划图表送交财政经济委员会方能拨款的规定，只可解决必须有工程设计的问题；而要能解决“正确”的工程设计与施工的问题，则应该集中优秀技术人员于“建设总署”，来审核指导。最大好处是能避免前述多用工料、不求经济与效率的严重浪费。
    二  制定工程规范
    工程要有标准的、适合国情的规范，才易于设计施工，才能避免留德的说德国规定这样作，留美的说美国规定那样作，而应该是我们自己规定怎样作。
    工程规范不是死东西，是可以根据新的成功的经验修改的。但应该法定可以改变规定作法的工程师，必须是在理论上经验上都有显著成就的某一些特许工程师与研究机关，他们并应把改变的理由，施工经过，完工以后的效果，详细报告“建设总署”，以便累积经验，改进规范。个别的人员认为：“我给老乡盖房子就没打过地脚。”因而拒绝执行规范中任何一条时，应认为非法施工。
        三  国产材料的试验
    国产材料要试验其性能，公布给大家采用，这样可避免浪费。例如我国打灰土，向来就是依老样作，不明究竟。这次津沽大学发表其十年来试验的结果，很可珍贵。但如能作各种不同作法的试验，因而指出是否需要改进目前施工方法时，对实践的指导作用就会更大。
    目前有些工程师不爱使用本国材料，这是不对的。国产材料试验中，应指出其性能中的优劣点，建议厂商改进作法。告诉工程师如何掌握材料的性能，施工结果才可以良好。
        四  制订标准图样
    标准图样制订后可供各技术工作者参考，这样作可以解决一部分我国有理论的技术人员缺乏问题。一般监工有了标准图样，就可以作比没有时好一些的设计工作。
    哈尔滨市建设局的同志们曾在这方向上努力过，这是一个面向群众的正确方向。
    可是要有组织有系统地来作这一工作，是需要统一的领导的。
        五  规定材料标准
    目前材料没标准，如暖气炉片，大小尺寸不一，价钱差很多，因而计算放热量没有标准，造成浪费，造成设计及施工的困难，应该研究制订标准规格，以便使用。
    六  调查工作率并向机械化方向发展
    目前土木建筑工程，还是手工业成份居多，因此估工估料的标准很不一致，造成预决算的混乱情形。如能调查各种情况下所作各种工程的工料实用数量，目前是需要的。
    将来应该多设计新的机械来代替手工工作，以增强工作效率及质量。
  五、结束语
    我在“技术上”工作、学习了十几年。在最近的几年，获得了一些经验，这些经验主要是从碰钉子中获得的。一般讲顺利成功的东西一幌过去，抓不到什么。钉子碰的越痛，收获越大。有很多感性认识想写将出来，虽然逢月过年都作总结，但总不满意。这回由于学习钻研实践论，因而发觉了肯要地方，又想写出来。实践论告诉我这正是一串实践的过程：先在工作中有了感性认识，想总结起来，但一再总结总不满意。或者说那正是在进行作总结的实践。然后经过学习，把自己的认识深化了一些，如是就写出这篇东西。在感性认识比我丰富，总结能力比我强的人看来，会觉得它不满人意，如果我自己继续进步的话，在将来也会因不满意而修改它。这是从实践中去体会的“实践论”。
    英明的毛主席在各方面指导着我们前进，指出了我们的毛病，又给开了对症的药方。对科学技术工作者来说，这药方是一样有效的。任何一个科学技术工作者，都要学习毛泽东思想，好好地消化、吸收，以便提高自己。
