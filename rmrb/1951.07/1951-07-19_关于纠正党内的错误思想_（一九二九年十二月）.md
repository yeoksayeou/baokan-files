Title: On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party (December 1929)

This is a resolution written by Comrade Mao Zedong for the Ninth Party Congress of the Fourth Red Army. The construction of the Chinese People's Army has gone through a difficult road. The Chinese Red Army (the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army during the Anti-Japanese War, now the People's Liberation Army) was founded from the Nanchang Uprising on August 1, 1927, to December 1929, after more than two years. During this period, the Communists in the Red Army struggled against various erroneous ideas, learned many things, and accumulated considerable experience. This resolution written by Comrade Mao Zedong is a summary of these experiences. This resolution completely established the Red Army on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and eliminated all the influences of the old-style army. This resolution was not only implemented in the Fourth Red Army, but later all parts of the Red Army did so successively, thus making the entire Chinese Red Army a truly people's army. In the past two decades, the Party work and political work in the Chinese People's Army have seen great development and creation, and the current appearance is very different from the past, but the basic line is still the line of this resolution.
            Mao Zedong Selected Works Publishing Committee

    Various non-proletarian ideas exist within the Communist Party of the Fourth Red Army, which greatly hinders the implementation of the Party's correct line. If these are not thoroughly corrected, the tasks given to the Fourth Red Army by the great Chinese revolutionary struggle will inevitably be impossible to undertake. The source of all kinds of incorrect ideas in the Fourth Army Party is naturally due to the fact that the largest part of the Party's organizational foundation is composed of peasants and other petty-bourgeois elements; however, the Party's leading organs' lack of consistent and resolute struggle against these incorrect ideas, and the lack of education for Party members on the correct line, are also important reasons for the existence and development of these incorrect ideas. In accordance with the spirit of the Central Committee's letter of September, the Congress pointed out the manifestations and sources of various non-proletarian ideas in the Fourth Army Party and the methods for correcting them, and called on comrades to thoroughly eliminate them.

  On the Purely Military Viewpoint

    The purely military viewpoint is very developed among some comrades in the Red Army. Its manifestations are:

    (1) It is believed that military and political affairs are opposed to each other, and it is not recognized that military affairs are only one of the tools for completing political tasks. Some even say "If military affairs are good, politics will naturally be good; if military affairs are not good, politics will not be good," which further believes that military affairs lead politics.

    (2) It is believed that the task of the Red Army is similar to that of the White Army, which is only to fight. They do not know that the Chinese Red Army is an armed group that carries out revolutionary political tasks. Especially now, the Red Army is by no means simply fighting; in addition to fighting to eliminate the enemy's military forces, it must also bear the important tasks of publicizing the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, helping the masses to establish political power, and even establishing the organization of the Communist Party. The Red Army's fighting is not purely for fighting, but for publicizing, organizing, and arming the masses, and helping the masses to build revolutionary political power. Without the goals of propaganda, organization, arming the masses and building revolutionary political power, the meaning of fighting is lost, and the meaning of the Red Army's existence is lost.

    (3) Therefore, in terms of organization, the political work organs of the Red Army are subordinate to the military work organs, and the slogan "the headquarters faces outwards" is put forward. If this idea develops, there is a danger of detaching from the masses, controlling the political power with the army, and deviating from the leadership of the proletariat, just like the warlordism that the Kuomintang army has taken.

    (4) At the same time, in propaganda work, the importance of propaganda teams is ignored. In mass organizations, the organization of army soldiers' associations and the organization of local workers and peasants are ignored. As a result, propaganda and organizational work have become a state of cancellation.

    (5) Be proud when winning battles, and be passive when losing battles.

    (6) Departmentalism, only knowing to plan for the Fourth Army, not knowing that arming the local masses is one of the important tasks of the Red Army. This is an enlarged form of small-group mentality.

    (7) A few comrades are limited to the local environment of the Fourth Army, thinking that there are no other revolutionary forces besides this. Therefore, the idea of preserving strength and avoiding struggle is very strong. This is a remnant of opportunism.

    (8) Regardless of subjective and objective conditions, committing revolutionary impatience, unwilling to do hard, meticulous and strict mass work, only want to do big things, full of illusions. This is a remnant of putschism [1].

    The sources of the purely military viewpoint:

    (1) Low political level. Therefore, they do not recognize the role of political leadership in the army, and do not recognize that the Red Army and the White Army are fundamentally different.

    (2) The idea of a mercenary army. Because many prisoners of war have been captured in previous battles, these elements joined the Red Army, bringing a strong idea of a mercenary army, which laid a lower-level foundation for the purely military viewpoint.

    (3) Because of the above two reasons, the third reason arises, that is, excessive belief in military power and disbelief in the power of the people.

    (4) The Party's lack of active attention and discussion of military work is also a reason for the formation of the purely military viewpoint of some comrades.

    Methods of correction:

    (1) Improve the political level within the Party through education, eliminate the theoretical source of the purely military viewpoint, and recognize the fundamental difference between the Red Army and the White Army. At the same time, it is also necessary to eliminate the remnants of opportunism and putschism, and break down the departmentalism of the Fourth Army.

    (2) Intensify the political training of officers and soldiers, especially the education of captured elements. At the same time, as far as possible, select workers and peasants with combat experience from local political power organs to join the Red Army, and weaken or even eliminate the source of the purely military viewpoint from the organizational level.

    (3) Launch criticism of the Red Army Party by the local Party and criticism of the Red Army by the mass political power organs, to influence the Red Army's Party and the Red Army's officers and soldiers.

    (4) The Party should pay active attention to and discuss military work. All work should be carried out by the masses after discussion and resolution by the Party.

    (5) Compile the Red Army regulations, clearly stipulating the tasks of the Red Army, the relationship between the military work system and the political work system, the relationship between the Red Army and the people, the powers and functions of the soldiers' association and its relationship with the military and political organs.

  On Ultra-Democracy

    After the Fourth Red Army accepted the instructions of the Central Committee, the phenomenon of ultra-democracy has been greatly reduced. For example, Party resolutions are relatively able to be implemented; the erroneous proposals to implement the so-called "democratic centralism from bottom to top" and "discuss with the lower level first, then resolve by the upper level" in the Red Army have not been raised again. But in practice, this reduction is only a temporary and superficial phenomenon, and it is not the elimination of the idea of ultra-democracy. That is to say, the roots of ultra-democracy are still deeply rooted in the minds of many comrades. For example, expressing various reluctant attitudes towards the implementation of resolutions is evidence.

    Methods of correction:

    (1) Eliminate the roots of ultra-democracy in theory. First of all, it is necessary to point out that the danger of ultra-democracy lies in damaging or even completely destroying the Party's organization, weakening or even completely destroying the Party's combat effectiveness, making the Party unable to bear the responsibility of struggle, which will inevitably lead to the failure of the revolution. Secondly, it is necessary to point out that the source of ultra-democracy lies in the freedom and laxity of the petty bourgeoisie. This freedom and laxity brought into the Party becomes the idea of political and organizational ultra-democracy. This idea is fundamentally incompatible with the struggle tasks of the proletariat.

    (2) In organization, strictly implement democratic life under centralized guidance. The route is:

    1 The Party's guiding organ must have a correct guiding line, and must come up with solutions when things happen, to establish a central hub of leadership.

    2 The higher-level organs must understand the situation of the lower-level organs and the living conditions of the masses, so as to become the objective basis for correct guidance.

    3 The Party's organs at all levels should not be too casual in solving problems. Once a resolution is made, it must be resolutely implemented.

    4 The resolutions of the higher-level organs, those that are important, must be quickly transmitted to the lower-level organs and Party members. The method is to hold activists' meetings, or branch meetings or even Party congresses of columns (depending on the possibility of the environment), and send people to attend and give reports.

    5 The Party's lower-level organs and Party members should conduct detailed discussions on the instructions of the higher-level organs, to thoroughly understand the meaning of the instructions, and decide on the method of implementing them.

  On Non-Organizational Viewpoints

    The manifestations of the non-organizational viewpoints existing in the Fourth Army Party are as follows:

    A. A minority disobeys the majority. For example, if a minority's proposal is rejected, they do not sincerely implement the Party's resolution.

    Methods of correction:

    (1) During meetings, people who attend should be allowed to express their opinions as much as possible. If there are controversial issues, the rights and wrongs should be clarified, and there should be no reconciliation or perfunctory. If it cannot be resolved once, discuss it again twice (provided that it does not hinder the work), in order to obtain a clear conclusion.

    (2) One of the Party's disciplines is that the minority submits to the majority. After the minority's opinions are rejected, they must support the resolution passed by the majority. Except when necessary, it can be proposed again for discussion at the next meeting, and no expression of opposition is allowed in action.

     B. Non-organizational criticism:

    (1) Criticism within the Party is a weapon to strengthen the Party's organization and increase the Party's combat effectiveness. However, some of the criticisms within the Red Army Party are not like this, but have become attacks on individuals. As a result, not only is the individual ruined, but the Party's organization is also ruined. This is a manifestation of petty-bourgeois individualism. The method of correction lies in making Party members understand that the purpose of criticism is to increase the Party's combat effectiveness in order to achieve the victory of the class struggle, and should not use criticism as a tool to attack individuals.

    (2) Many Party members do not criticize within the Party but go outside the Party to criticize. This is because ordinary Party members do not understand the importance of the Party's organization (meetings, etc.), and think that there is no difference between criticizing within the organization or outside the organization. The method of correction is to educate Party members to understand the importance of the Party's organization, and if there is any criticism of the Party committee or comrades, it should be raised at the Party meeting.

  On Absolute Egalitarianism

    Absolute egalitarianism in the Red Army developed very seriously for a period of time. For example: when issuing expenses for wounded soldiers, they opposed distinguishing between minor and serious injuries, and demanded equal distribution. Riding a horse by officers was not considered a work need, but was considered an unequal system. Distribution of goods required extreme equality, unwilling to give a little more to parts with special circumstances. Carrying rice did not ask about the strength of adults and children, but required equal carrying. Housing should be divided equally, and if the headquarters lived in a slightly larger house, they would be scolded. Assigning service had to be assigned equally, and they were unwilling to do a little more. Even in the case of two wounded soldiers on a stretcher, they would rather everyone fail to carry it than have one person carried away. These all prove that the absolute egalitarianism among Red Army officers and soldiers is still very serious.

    The source of absolute egalitarianism, like political ultra-democracy, is a product of handicrafts and small-peasant economy, but one is seen in political life and the other is seen in material life.

    Methods of correction: It should be pointed out that absolute egalitarianism is only a fantasy of farmers and petty-bourgeois elements not only in the period when capitalism has not been eliminated; even in the socialist period, the distribution of materials must also be in accordance with the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work" and the needs of work, and there is no such thing as absolute equality. The material distribution of Red Army personnel should achieve general equality, such as equal salaries for officers and soldiers, because this is needed by the current struggle environment. However, it is necessary to oppose absolute egalitarianism regardless of all reasons, because this is not a need for struggle, but the opposite, and it hinders the struggle.

  On Subjectivism

    Subjectivism exists strongly in certain Party members, which is very unfavorable for analyzing the political situation and guiding work. Because the inevitable result of the subjectivist analysis of the political situation and the subjectivist guidance of work is either opportunism or putschism. As for the subjectivist criticism within the Party, reckless talk without evidence, or mutual suspicion, often leads to unprincipled disputes within the Party and destroys the Party's organization.

    Regarding the issue of criticism within the Party, there is one more point to be mentioned, that is, some comrades' criticisms do not pay attention to the big aspects, but only pay attention to the small aspects. They do not understand that the main task of criticism is to point out political and organizational errors. As for personal shortcomings, if they are not related to political and organizational errors, then there is no need to criticize too much, so that comrades are at a loss. Moreover, if this kind of criticism develops, the Party's spirit will be completely focused on small shortcomings, and everyone will become cautious gentlemen, and will forget the Party's political tasks, which is a great danger.

    Methods of correction: The main thing is to educate Party members to politicize and scientize the thoughts of Party members and the life within the Party. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to: (1) Educate Party members to use Marxist-Leninist methods to analyze political forms and estimate class forces, to replace subjectivist analysis and estimation. (2) Make Party members pay attention to the investigation and research of socio-economics, thereby determining the strategy of struggle and the method of work, so that comrades know that leaving the investigation of the actual situation will fall into the abyss of fantasy and putschism. (3) Party criticism should prevent subjective arbitrariness and vulgarizing criticism, speak with evidence, and criticism should pay attention to politics.

  On Individualism

    The tendencies of individualism within the Red Army Party have the following manifestations:

    (1) Revenge-seeking. After being criticized by soldier comrades within the Party, they find opportunities outside the Party to retaliate against him, and beating and scolding is a means of retaliation. They also seek revenge within the Party; if you said something about me at this meeting, I will find fault with you at the next meeting to retaliate against you. This revenge-seeking completely starts from a personal point of view, not knowing that there are class interests and the interests of the entire Party. Its target is not the hostile class, but other individuals in its own ranks. This is a corrosive agent that weakens the organization and weakens combat effectiveness.

    (2) Small-group mentality. Only paying attention to the interests of their own small group, not paying attention to the interests of the whole, superficially not for individuals, but actually containing extremely narrow individualism, and similarly has a great corrosive and centrifugal effect. The trend of small groups has always been very strong in the Red Army. After criticism, it is better now, but its remnants still exist and must be worked hard to overcome.

    (3) Mercenary thinking. Not recognizing that the Party and the Red Army are tools for carrying out revolutionary tasks, and that they themselves are members of them. Not recognizing that they themselves are the subject of the revolution, thinking that they are only responsible to the superiors personally, not responsible to the revolution. This passive idea of mercenary revolution is also a manifestation of individualism. This idea of mercenary revolution is the reason why there are not many active activists who strive unconditionally. If the idea of mercenaries is not eliminated, active activists will not be able to increase, and the heavy burden of revolution will always be placed on the shoulders of a few people, which is extremely unfavorable to the struggle.

    (4) Hedonism. Individualism is also seen in the enjoyment aspect, and there are many people in the Red Army. They always hope that the team will go to big cities. They want to go to big cities not to work, but to enjoy themselves. They are most unwilling to work in the red areas where life is difficult.

    (5) Passive sluggishness. If they are slightly dissatisfied, they become passive and do not do work. The reason is mainly the lack of education, but there are also cases where leaders handle problems, assign work, or enforce discipline inappropriately.

    (6) Leaving the team. The number of people working in the Red Army who request to leave the team and be transferred to local work is increasing day by day. The reasons are not entirely personal, but also: first, the material life of the Red Army is too poor; second, long-term struggle, feeling tired; third, improper handling of problems, assignment of work, or enforcement of discipline.

    Methods of correction: The main thing is to strengthen education and correct individualism ideologically. Furthermore, problems should be handled, work should be assigned, and discipline should be enforced properly. And we must try to improve the material life of the Red Army, and take advantage of all possible opportunities to rest and reorganize in order to improve material conditions. The social source of individualism is the reflection of the thoughts of the petty bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisie within the Party, and this must be explained when conducting education.

  On the Idea of Wandering Bands

    Due to the large number of vagrant elements in the Red Army and the existence of a large number of vagrant masses in the whole country, especially in the southern provinces, the political thought of roving banditry has emerged in the Red Army. This idea is manifested in: First, unwilling to do hard work to establish base areas, establish the political power of the people, and thereby expand political influence, but only want to expand political influence by means of mobile guerrilla warfare. Second, to expand the Red Army, not taking the route from expanding local militia, local Red Army to expanding the main Red Army, but wanting to take the route of "recruiting soldiers and buying horses" and "recruiting and surrendering traitors." Third, impatient to work with the masses in arduous struggles, only hoping to run to big cities to eat and drink. All the manifestations of this idea of roving banditry greatly hinder the Red Army from carrying out correct tasks, so eliminating the idea of roving banditry is an important goal of ideological struggle within the Red Army Party. It should be recognized that the roving banditry of Huang Chao [2] and Li Chuang [3] in history is no longer permitted by today's environment.

    Methods of correction:

    (1) Intensify education, criticize incorrect ideas, and eliminate the idea of roving banditry.

    (2) Intensify the education against hooligan consciousness for the existing basic Red Army team and the newly arrived prisoners of war.

    (3) Strive for workers and peasants with combat experience to actively join the Red Army team and change the composition of the Red Army.

    (4) Create new Red Army units from the struggling workers and peasants.

  On the Remnants of Putschism

    The Red Army Party has already fought against putschism, but it is still insufficient. Therefore, there are still remnants of the idea of putschism in the Red Army. Its manifestations are: First, reckless work regardless of subjective and objective conditions. Second, the city policy is not fully and resolutely implemented. Third, military discipline is lax, especially when losing battles. Fourth, some troops still have arson. Fifth, the system of shooting deserters and the system of corporal punishment also have the nature of putschism. The social source of putschism is the combination of the thoughts of lumpenproletarians and the thoughts of the petty bourgeoisie.

    Methods of correction:

    (1) Eliminate putschism ideologically.

    (2) Correct putschist behavior from the system and policies.

    Annotation:

    [1] In the short period after the failure of the 1927 revolution, a "left" leaning putschist tendency appeared in the Communist Party, believing that the nature of the Chinese revolution was the so-called "continuous revolution," and the situation of the Chinese revolution was the so-called "continuous rise," so they were unwilling to organize an orderly retreat, and wrongly used commandism to attempt to rely on a few Party members and a few masses to organize many local uprisings across the country without hope of victory. This putschist action was once popular at the end of 1927, and gradually stopped at the beginning of 1928. But some Party members still have this emotion. Putschism is adventurism.

    [2] Huang Chao was the leader of the peasant uprising at the end of the Tang Dynasty, a native of Caozhou, Shandong. In 875 AD, the second year of Emperor Xizong of Tang Dynasty, Huang Chao gathered people to respond to the uprising held by his fellow villager Wang Xianzhi. After Wang Xianzhi was killed, Huang Chao collected Wang's remnants and called himself "General Chongtian." The uprising team led by Huang Chao had twice went out of Shandong to fight. The first time it went from Shandong to Henan, transferred to Anhui and Hubei, and returned to Shandong from Hubei. The second time it went from Shandong to Henan again, transferred to Jiangxi, went through eastern Zhejiang to Fujian and Guangdong, transferred to Guangxi through Hunan to Hubei, then went east from Hubei to Anhui, Zhejiang and other places, and then crossed the Huai River into Henan, captured Luoyang, broke through Tongguan, and occupied Chang'an. After Huang Chao entered Chang'an, he established the Qi State and called himself emperor. Later, due to internal divisions (General Zhu Wen surrendered to the Tang Dynasty), and the attack by the army of the Shatuo chieftain Li Keyong, Huang Chao lost Chang'an, entered Henan again, returned to Shandong from Henan, and finally failed and committed suicide. Huang Chao's war continued for ten years and is one of the famous peasant wars in Chinese history. The history books of the old ruling class said: At that time, "the people who were troubled by heavy taxes competed to return to him." But he simply carried out mobile warfare and never established a relatively stable base area, so he was called a "roving bandit."

    [3] Li Chuang, namely Li Zicheng, was the leader of the peasant uprising at the end of the Ming Dynasty, a native of Mizhi, Shaanxi. In 1628 AD, the first year of Emperor Chongzhen of Ming Dynasty, peasants in northern Shaanxi formed a trend of uprising. Li Zicheng joined Gao Yingxiang's uprising team, and once entered Henan from Shaanxi, to Anhui, and returned to Shaanxi. In 1636, Gao Yingxiang died, and Li Zicheng was elected as King Chuang. Li Zicheng's main slogan among the masses was "Welcome King Chuang, no taxes." He restrained the discipline of the team, and once had the slogan "killing one person is like killing my father, raping one person is like raping my mother." Therefore, many people supported him and became the mainstream of the peasant uprising at that time. But he also did not establish a relatively stable base area, and always drifted east and fled west. After he was elected as King Chuang, he led his troops into Sichuan, turned back to southern Shaanxi, passed through Hubei and entered Henan again, and then occupied Xiangyang, Hubei, and then occupied Xi'an, Shaanxi through Henan. In 1644, he attacked and entered Beijing through Shanxi. Soon after, he was defeated by the combined attack of the Qing army led by Ming general Wu Sangui.

　　关于纠正党内的错误思想  （一九二九年十二月）
　　毛泽东
    这是毛泽东同志为红军第四军第九次党的代表大会写的决议。中国人民军队的建设，是经过了艰难的道路的。中国红军（抗日时期是八路军、新四军，现在是人民解放军）从一九二七年八月一日南昌起义时期创始，到一九二九年十二月，经过了两年多的时间。在这个时期内，红军中的共产党和各种错误思想作斗争，学到了许多东西，积累了相当丰富的经验。毛泽东同志写的这个决议，就是这些经验的总结。这个决议使红军完全建立在马克思列宁主义的基础上，将一切旧式军队的影响都肃清了。这个决议不但在红军第四军实行了，后来各部分红军都先后不等地照此做了，这样就使整个中国红军完全成为真正的人民军队。二十几年来，中国人民军队中的党的工作和政治工作有广大的发展和创造，现在的面貌和过去大不相同了，但是基本的路线还是这个决议的路线。
            毛泽东选集出版委员会
    红军第四军的共产党内存在着各种非无产阶级的思想，这对于执行党的正确路线，妨碍极大。若不彻底纠正，则中国伟大革命斗争给予红军第四军的任务，是必然担负不起来的。四军党内种种不正确思想的来源，自然是由于党的组织基础的最大部分是由农民和其他小资产阶级出身的成份所构成的；但是党的领导机关对于这些不正确的思想缺乏一致的坚决的斗争，缺乏对党员作正确路线的教育，也是使这些不正确思想存在和发展的重要原因。大会根据中央九月来信的精神，指出四军党内各种非无产阶级思想的表现来源及其纠正的方法，号召同志们起来彻底地加以肃清。
  关于单纯军事观点
    单纯军事观点在红军一部分同志中非常发展。其表现如：
    （一）认为军事政治二者是对立的，不承认军事只是完成政治任务的工具之一。甚至还有说“军事好，政治自然会好，军事不好，政治也不会好”的，则更进一步认为军事领导政治了。
    （二）以为红军的任务也和白军相仿佛，只是单纯地打仗的。不知道中国的红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。特别是现在，红军决不是单纯地打仗的，它除了打仗消灭敌人军事力量之外，还要负担宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众、帮助群众建立政权以至于建立共产党的组织等项重大的任务。红军的打仗，不是单纯地为了打仗而打仗，而是为了宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众、并帮助群众建设革命政权才去打仗的，离了对群众的宣传、组织、武装和建设革命政权等项目标，就是失去了打仗的意义，也就是失去了红军存在的意义。
    （三）因此，在组织上，把红军的政治工作机关隶属于军事工作机关，提出“司令部对外”的口号。这种思想如果发展下去，便有走到脱离群众、以军队控制政权、离开无产阶级领导的危险，如像国民党军队所走的军阀主义的道路一样。
    （四）同时，在宣传工作上，忽视宣传队的重要性。在群众组织上，忽视军队士兵会的组织和对地方工农群众的组织。结果，宣传和组织工作，都成了被取消的状态。
    （五）打胜仗就骄傲，打败仗就消极。
    （六）本位主义，一切只知道为四军打算，不知道武装地方群众是红军的重要任务之一。这是一种放大了的小团体主义。
    （七）有少数同志囿于四军的局部环境，以为除此就没有别的革命势力了。因此，保存实力、避免斗争的思想非常浓厚。这是机会主义的残余。
    （八）不顾主客观条件，犯着革命的急性病，不愿意艰苦地做细小严密的群众工作，只想大干，充满着幻想。这是盲动主义的残余〔一〕。
    单纯军事观点的来源：
    （一）政治水平低。因此不认识军队中政治领导的作用，不认识红军和白军是根本不同的。
    （二）雇佣军队的思想。因为历次作战俘虏兵甚多，此种分子加入红军，带来了浓厚的雇佣军队的思想，使单纯军事观点有了下层基础。
    （三）因有以上两个原因，便发生第三个原因，就是过分相信军事力量，而不相信人民群众的力量。
    （四）党对于军事工作没有积极的注意和讨论，也是形成一部分同志的单纯军事观点的原因。
    纠正的方法：
    （一）从教育上提高党内的政治水平，肃清单纯军事观点的理论根源，认清红军和白军的根本区别。同时，还要肃清机会主义和盲动主义的残余，打破四军本位主义。
    （二）加紧官兵的政治训练，特别是对俘虏成份的教育要加紧。同时，尽其可能由地方政权机关选派有斗争经验的工农分子，加入红军，从组织上削弱以至去掉单纯军事观点的来源。
    （三）发动地方党对红军党的批评和群众政权机关对红军的批评，以影响红军的党和红军的官兵。
    （四）党对于军事工作要有积极的注意和讨论。一切工作，在党的讨论和决议之后，再经过群众去执行。
    （五）编制红军法规，明白地规定红军的任务，军事工作系统和政治工作系统的关系，红军和人民群众的关系，士兵会的权能及其和军事政治机关的关系。
  关于极端民主化
    红军第四军在接受中央指示之后，极端民主化的现象，减少了许多。例如党的决议比较地能够执行了；要求在红军中实行所谓“由下而上的民主集权制”、“先交下级讨论，再由上级决议”等项错误主张，也没有人再提了。但是在实际上，这种减少，只是一时的和表面的现象，还不是极端民主化的思想的肃清。这就是说，极端民主化的根苗还深种在许多同志的思想中。例如对于决议案的执行，表示种种勉强的态度，就是证据。
    纠正的方法：
    （一）从理论上扫除极端民主化的根苗。首先，要指出极端民主化的危险，在于损伤以至完全破坏党的组织，削弱以至完全毁灭党的战斗力，使党担负不起斗争的责任，由此必然造成革命的失败。其次，要指出极端民主化的来源，在于小资产阶级的自由散漫性。这种自由散漫性带到党内，就成了政治上的和组织上的极端民主化的思想。这种思想是和无产阶级的斗争任务根本不相容的。
    （二）在组织上，厉行集中指导下的民主生活。其路线是：
    １  党的指导机关要有正确的指导路线，遇事要拿出办法，以建立领导的中枢。
    ２  上级机关要明了下级机关的情况和群众生活的情况，成为正确指导的客观基础。
    ３  党的各级机关解决问题，不要太随便。一成决议，就须坚决执行。
    ４  上级机关的决议，凡属重要一点的，必须迅速地传达到下级机关和党员群众中去。其办法是开活动分子会，或开支部以至纵队的党员大会（须看环境的可能），派人出席作报告。
    ５  党的下级机关和党员群众对于上级机关的指示，要经过详尽的讨论，以求彻底地了解指示的意义，并决定对它的执行方法。
  关于非组织观点
    四军党内存在着的非组织的观点，其表现如下：
    甲  少数不服从多数。例如少数人的提议被否决，他们就不诚意地执行党的决议。
    纠正的方法：
    （一）开会时要使到会的人尽量发表意见。有争论的问题，要把是非弄明白，不要调和敷衍。一次不能解决的，二次再议（以不妨碍工作为条件），以期得到明晰的结论。
    （二）党的纪律之一是少数服从多数。少数人在自己的意见被否决之后，必须拥护多数人所通过的决议。除必要时得在下一次会议再提出讨论外，不得在行动上有任何反对的表示。
     乙  非组织的批评：
    （一）党内批评是坚强党的组织、增加党的战斗力的武器。但是红军党内的批评有些不是这样，变成了攻击个人。其结果，不但毁坏了个人，也毁坏了党的组织。这是小资产阶级个人主义的表现。纠正的方法，在于使党员明白批评的目的是增加党的战斗力以达到阶级斗争的胜利，不应当利用批评去做攻击个人的工具。
    （二）许多党员不在党内批评而在党外去批评。这是因为一般党员还不懂得党的组织（会议等）的重要，以为批评在组织内或在组织外没有什么分别。纠正的方法，就是要教育党员懂得党的组织的重要性，对党委或同志有所批评应当在党的会议上提出。
  关于绝对平均主义
    红军中的绝对平均主义，有一个时期发展得很厉害。例如：发给伤兵用费，反对分伤轻伤重，要求平均发给。官长骑马，不认为是工作需要，而认为是不平等制度。分物品要求极端平均，不愿意有特别情形的部分多分去一点。背米不问大人小孩体强体弱，要平均背。住房子要分得一样平，司令部住了一间大点的房子也要骂起来。派勤务要派得一样平，稍微多做一点就不肯。甚至在一副担架两个伤兵的情况，宁愿大家抬不成，不愿把一个人抬了去。这些都证明红军官兵中的绝对平均主义还很严重。
    绝对平均主义的来源，和政治上的极端民主化一样，是手工业和小农经济的产物，不过一则见之于政治生活方面，一则见之于物质生活方面罢了。
    纠正的方法：应指出绝对平均主义不但在资本主义没有消灭的时期，只是农民小资产者的一种幻想；就是在社会主义时期，物质的分配也要按照“各尽所能各取所值”的原则和工作的需要，决无所谓绝对的平均。红军人员的物质分配，应该做到大体上的平均，例如官兵薪饷平等，因为这是现时斗争环境所需要的。但是必须反对不问一切理由的绝对平均主义，因为这不是斗争的需要，适得其反，是于斗争有妨碍的。
  关于主观主义
    主观主义，在某些党员中浓厚地存在，这对分析政治形势和指导工作，都非常不利。因为对于政治形势的主观主义的分析和对于工作的主观主义的指导，其必然的结果，不是机会主义，就是盲动主义。至于党内的主观主义的批评，不要证据的乱说，或互相猜忌，往往酿成党内的无原则纠纷，破坏党的组织。
    关于党内批评问题，还有一点要说及的，就是有些同志的批评不注意大的方面，只注意小的方面。他们不明白批评的主要任务，是指出政治上的错误和组织上的错误。至于个人缺点，如果不是与政治的和组织的错误有联系，则不必多所指摘，使同志们无所措手足。而且这种批评一发展，党内精神完全集注到小的缺点方面，人人变成了谨小慎微的君子，就会忘记党的政治任务，这是很大的危险。
    纠正的方法：主要是教育党员使党员的思想和党内的生活都政治化，科学化。要达到这个目的，就要：（一）教育党员用马克思列宁主义的方法去作政治形式的分析和阶级势力的估量，以代替主观主义的分析和估量。（二）使党员注意社会经济的调查和研究，由此来决定斗争的策略和工作的方法，使同志们知道离开了实际情况的调查，就要堕入空想和盲动的深坑。（三）党内批评要防止主观武断和把批评庸俗化，说话要有证据，批评要注意政治。
  关于个人主义
    红军党内的个人主义的倾向有如下各种表现：
    （一）报复主义。在党内受了士兵同志的批评，到党外找机会报复他，打骂就是报复的一种手段。在党内也寻报复；你在这次会议上说了我，我就在下次会议上找岔子报复你。这种报复主义，完全从个人观点出发，不知有阶级的利益和整个党的利益。它的目标不在敌对阶级，而在自己队伍里的别的个人。这是一种削弱组织、削弱战斗力的销蚀剂。
    （二）小团体主义。只注意自己小团体的利益，不注意整体的利益，表面上不是为个人，实际上包含了极狭隘的个人主义，同样地具有很大的销蚀作用和离心作用。红军中历来小团体风气很盛，经过批评现在是好些了，但其残余依然存在，还须努力克服。
    （三）雇佣思想。不认识党和红军都是执行革命任务的工具，而自己是其中的一员。不认识自己是革命的主体，以为自己仅仅对长官个人负责任，不是对革命负责任。这种消极的雇佣革命的思想，也是一种个人主义的表现。这种雇佣革命的思想，是无条件努力的积极活动分子所以不很多的原因。雇佣思想不肃清，积极活动分子便无由增加，革命的重担便始终放在少数人的肩上，于斗争极为不利。
    （四）享乐主义。个人主义见于享乐方面的，在红军中也有不少的人。他们总是希望队伍开到大城市去。他们要到大城市不是为了去工作，而是为了去享乐。他们最不乐意的是在生活艰难的红色区域里工作。
    （五）消极怠工。稍不遂意，就消极起来，不做工作。其原因主要是缺乏教育，但也有是领导者处理问题、分配工作或执行纪律不适当。
    （六）离队思想。在红军工作的人要求脱离队伍调地方工作的与日俱增。其原因，也不完全是个人的，尚有一，红军物质生活过差；二，长期斗争，感觉疲劳；三，处理问题、分配工作、或执行纪律不适当等项原因。
    纠正的方法，主要是加强教育，从思想上纠正个人主义。再则处理问题，分配工作，执行纪律要得当。并要设法改善红军的物质生活，利用一切可能时机休息整理，以改善物质条件。个人主义的社会来源是小资产阶级和资产阶级的思想在党内的反映，当进行教育的时候必须说明这一点。
  关于流寇思想
    由于红军中游民成份占了很大的数量和全国特别是南方各省有广大游民群众的存在，就在红军中产生了流寇主义的政治思想。这种思想表现在：一，不愿意做艰苦工作建立根据地，建立人民群众的政权，并由此去扩大政治影响，而只想用流动游击的方法，去扩大政治影响。二，扩大红军，不走由扩大地方赤卫队、地方红军到扩大主力红军的路线，而要走“招兵买马”“招降纳叛”的路线。三，不耐烦和群众在一块作艰苦的斗争，只希望跑到大城市去大吃大喝。凡此一切流寇思想的表现，极大地妨碍着红军去执行正确的任务，故肃清流寇思想，实为红军党内思想斗争的一个重要目标。应当认识，历史上黄巢〔二〕、李闯〔三〕式的流寇主义，已为今日的环境所不许可。
    纠正的方法：
    （一）加紧教育，批评不正确思想，肃清流寇主义。
    （二）对现有红军基本队伍和新来的俘虏兵，加紧反流氓意识的教育。
    （三）争取有斗争经验的工农积极分子加入红军队伍，改变红军的成份。
    （四）从斗争的工农群众中创造出新的红军部队。
  关于盲动主义残余
    红军党内对盲动主义已经做了斗争，但尚不充分。因此，红军中还有盲动主义思想的残余存在着。其表现如：一，不顾主观和客观条件的盲干。二，城市政策执行得不充分，不坚决。三，军纪松懈，特别是打败仗时。四，还有某些部队有烧屋行为。五，枪毙逃兵的制度和肉刑制度，也是带着盲动主义性质的。盲动主义的社会来源是流氓无产者的思想和小资产阶级的思想的综合。
    纠正的方法：
    （一）从思想上肃清盲动主义。
    （二）从制度上和政策上纠正盲动的行为。
    附注：
    〔一〕  一九二七年革命失败后的短期间，在共产党内曾经出现一种“左”倾盲动主义倾向，认为中国革命的性质是所谓“不断革命”，
  中国革命的形势是所谓“不断高涨”，因而不肯去组织有秩序的
  退却，错误地用命令主义的方法，企图依靠少数党员和少数群众
  在全国组织毫无胜利希望的许多的地方起义。这种盲动主义的行
  动曾经在一九二七年底流行过，到了一九二八年初渐渐地停止了
  下来。但有些党员也还存在着这种情绪。盲动主义就是冒险主义。
    〔二〕  黄巢是唐朝末年农民起义的领袖，山东曹州人。公元八七五年，即唐僖宗乾符二年，黄巢聚众响应他的同乡王仙芝举行的起义。
  王仙芝被杀后，黄巢收集王的余部，号“冲天大将军”。黄巢带
  领的起义队伍曾经两次出山东流动作战。第一次由山东到河南，
  转入安徽和湖北，由湖北回到山东。第二次又由山东到河南，转
  到江西，经浙东到福建及广东，转广西经湖南到湖北，再由湖北
  东进安徽浙江等地，然后渡淮入河南，克洛阳，攻破潼关，据有
  长安。黄巢入长安后建立齐国，称皇帝。后因内部分裂（大将朱
  温降唐），又被沙陀族酋长李克用的军队进攻，黄巢失长安，又
  入河南，由河南回到山东，终于失败自杀。黄巢的战争继续了十
  年，是中国历史上有名的农民战争之一。旧统治阶级的史书称：
  当时“民之困于重敛者争归之”。但他只是简单地进行流动的战
  争，没有建立过比较稳固的根据地，所以被称为“流寇”。
    〔三〕  李闯即李自成，是明朝末年农民起义的领袖，陕西米脂人。公元一六二八年，即明思宗崇祯元年，陕西北部农民形成起义的潮流
  。李自成参加高迎祥的起义队伍，曾经由陕西入河南，到安徽，
  折回陕西。一六三六年高迎祥死，李自成被推为闯王。李自成在
  群众中的主要口号是“迎闯王，不纳粮”。他约束队伍的纪律，
  曾有“杀一人如杀我父、淫一人如淫我母”的口号。因此，拥护
  他的人很多，成为当时农民起义的主流。但他也没有建立过比较
  稳固的根据地，总是东流西窜。他于被推为闯王后，率部入川，
  折回陕南，经湖北又入河南，旋占湖北襄阳，再经河南攻陕占西
  安，于一六四四年经山西攻入北京。不久为明将吴三桂勾引清兵
  联合进攻而失败。
