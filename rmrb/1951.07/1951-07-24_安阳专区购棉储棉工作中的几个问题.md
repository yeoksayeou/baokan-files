Several Problems in Cotton Purchase and Storage Work in Anyang Special District
　　Kang Weizhong
　　The cotton purchase and storage work in Anyang Special District, Pingyuan Province, began to be deployed to villages in late June. All counties held meetings of district and village cadres, representative meetings of various circles, and cotton farmer symposiums to carry out patriotic ideological education, improve the political awareness of cadres and cotton farmers, and cultivate activists who take the lead in selling cotton. Subsequently, leading organs at all levels uniformly organized cadre forces to go deep into the countryside, cooperate with village cadres, fully mobilize the masses, and launch a cotton selling and storage movement. According to statistics from the Anyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, as of July 5th, the entire district had collected 800,000 jin of ginned cotton, completing one-fifth of the district's total cotton purchase and storage task (4 million jin). This movement is still ongoing.

  It is necessary to correctly publicize the State Council's instructions on cotton purchase and storage work
　　Generally speaking, Anyang Special District has correctly implemented the State Council's instructions on cotton purchase and storage work. However, in specific implementation, some grassroots cadres made deviations. For example, when cadres in the Nan Zhang Wang base point village in Tangyin County conveyed the message to the masses, they said: "Currently, factories across the country have stopped working, and the country urgently needs cotton. The government calls on us to dedicate cotton. We should dedicate cotton and love the country." As a result, cotton farmers mistakenly believed that the state was not purchasing cotton but asking everyone to donate cotton; some cotton farmers also reported a little, but all reported very little, mostly one or two liang, four liang, or half a jin. Sixteen cotton farmer households in Bei Zhang Wang Village reported a total of half a jin of cotton. Some village cadres, after returning to the village, only gave the farmers a speech on patriotism at the general meeting, and in individual mobilization after the meeting, they all emphasized the individual interests of the farmers, calculated economic accounts, talked about prices, talked about interest, and said that storing it at home requires self-care, and it may catch fire, be eaten by rats, or rot. Because farmers did not clearly understand the consistency of national and individual interests and only saw that the cadres were very anxious, they were even more thinking that cotton prices would rise and hesitated to sell. Some cotton farmers even said: "To get rich, save cotton." Yang Haozhi, a cotton farmer in Nan Chen Wang Village, Tangyin First District, said: "We have been growing cotton for decades and have never seen the government send someone to our village to buy cotton; this time, more than a dozen cadres came to the village to mobilize cotton sales. The price of cotton must rise greatly, so let's wait!" As a result, he did not sell any of his cotton. In individual publicity and mobilization in Xia Mao Yi Jian, Anyang Ninth District, the same psychology occurred among cotton farmers because of emphasizing economic accounts and simply talking about personal interests, and most reported very little. In addition, some cadres combined the publicity of donating planes and cannons in the publicity of cotton purchase and storage work. However, the relationship between the two tasks was not made clear, which made cotton farmers mistakenly believe that after selling cotton, all or most of it would have to be donated, so they had concerns and were unwilling to sell. Xi Gao Ping Village, Anyang Sixth District, estimated that cotton farmers had 20,000 jin of cotton in storage, but only reported 50 jin, mainly for this reason. These all show that in implementing the instructions for cotton purchase and storage, it is necessary to explain the principles and policies clearly to grassroots cadres so that they can understand the spirit of the policies. Otherwise, when conducting publicity to the masses, there will be phenomena of misrepresentation, unclear explanation, or incorrect spirit, which will have a very bad impact on the movement.
　　To overcome these phenomena, the special district has currently formed inspection teams of more than a thousand people, mainly composed of cadres from the Party Committee and County Committee organs, to go deep into the countryside separately for inspection. When it is found that there are deviations in the implementation of policies in some places, they immediately make up for the lesson to eliminate various mass ideological concerns and misunderstandings caused by unclear policy explanations and promote the early completion of cotton purchase and storage tasks.

  Correct the tendency of blind optimism or blind pessimism among district and village cadres
　　Currently, some district and village cadres in Anyang Special District have two tendencies in their thinking. One is to be satisfied with the superficial hustle and bustle, and with a little achievement, they show blind optimism, even thinking that the task has been completed, and therefore relax their leadership. The other is to blindly believe that the task is too big, there are too many difficulties in the work, and there is not enough confidence to complete the task.
　　The former situation mostly occurs like this: after district and village cadres return to the village and hold branch meetings, cadre meetings, women's meetings, cotton farmer symposiums, and mass meetings, and after initial patriotic ideological education, some activists have reported their cotton storage one after another, which appears to be bustling and lively on the surface, and cadres think that the movement has started, and all or most of the cotton has been sold. However, in-depth inspections often reveal that they are underreporting, and there is still a lot of cotton in storage, some even only reporting a fraction.
　　The latter situation is also due to a lack of in-depth investigation and publicity work, not knowing the bottom line, thus generating blind pessimism. After the cadres of many districts and villages in Tangyin County returned to the village and held several mobilization meetings, the masses did not move, so they said discouragedly: "Anyway, I can't complete the cotton purchase and storage task, let the superiors criticize and punish me!" The Secretary of the Party Committee of the Ninth District of Anyang said when the cotton purchase and storage work was just deployed: "The assigned task cannot be completed no matter what. I will just do my best." The way to overcome this should be to educate and help them to carry out in-depth publicity and investigation work, master the materials, and increase confidence.

  Political mobilization should be combined with material supply and purchase business
　　In cotton purchase and storage, political mobilization must be combined with material supply. The state has stipulated many measures to take care of the interests of cotton farmers, such as appropriate prices and the supply of materials needed by cotton farmers, which must be effectively realized. Many cotton farmers ask this question: "Is what you are saying so good really going to happen?" They are afraid that "patriotic cotton sales will give less money," afraid that the scales will be unfair, and afraid that they will not be able to immediately buy the necessary materials after selling cotton. Cui Jinrong, a cotton farmer in Xiba Lizhuang, Anyang, first took forty jin to try it out when selling cotton. After actually getting the wheat ticket, he sold all the three hundred jin of cotton. Then he used his own experience to tell four neighbors to sell their five hundred jin of cotton. When the Secretary of the Communist Party Branch of Qingyu Village mobilized farmers to sell cotton, he also asked everyone to go to the Shuiye Cotton Station to try it out first. The farmers saw that the cotton station was fair in weighing, quick in accounting, and good in hospitality. After returning to the village and publicizing it, the whole village sent four thousand jin of cotton to the cotton station in one day.
　　According to the experience of the special district, the economic work should mainly grasp two points: 1. In addition to cotton receiving stations, a large number of mobile cotton receiving teams should also be organized. At present, there are eighteen cotton receiving teams in the whole district, and they are still being organized. The mobile cotton receiving teams have given great convenience to the masses: because it is the busy farming season, the masses can sell cotton and exchange for necessities without leaving the village. Before the acquisition team arrived in Qincun, only 400 jin were reported in five or six days; however, after the cotton receiving team went to the countryside and collected cotton on the spot and gave the masses grain tickets, coal tickets, cash, and savings certificates, 3,500 jin of cotton were collected in half a day. 2. It is necessary to organize inspections from top to bottom and strictly enforce economic discipline. Because some economic cadres still have a tendency to not ask about politics, this point should be paid special attention to. For this reason, the Prefectural Committee and the Commissioner's Office specially organized a dozen cadres to conduct inspections at various cotton receiving stations, which had a great effect. However, it was recently discovered that there are still many problems in the Shang Mao Yi Jian cotton purchasing station: for example, if there is not enough food money, they do not report to the superior in time to solve it; they issue receipts to the masses without stamping them, and the masses cannot get food with the unsealed receipts; some masses sell a little cotton and have to wait two or three days in the cotton depot. The Financial and Economic Committee of the current Commissioner's Office is being improved.

  General publicity and mobilization must be combined with individual publicity and mobilization
　　The experience of Anyang Special District proves that the general publicity of the principle of "loving the country and selling cotton" can only initially solve the relationship between individual cotton farmers and the country. But when cotton farmers really want to take out cotton, there are still many specific concerns, each person is different. Without individual publicity to solve each person's specific concerns, cotton cannot be taken out, or the amount taken out is very small. Ma Lizhu, a cotton farmer in Liang Zhang Village, Anyang Ninth District, had more than 700 jin of cotton and was unwilling to sell it. After the Secretary of the Communist Party Branch of the village had an in-depth conversation with him, he realized that he had two problems in his mind: one was that he had a plan to buy a mule, and he wanted to wait until the seventh day of the seventh lunar month to see if the new cotton was preserved and then sell the cotton to buy a big mule; if the cotton seedlings were not good, he would buy grain. He didn't want to sell now. The other problem was that the Japanese invaders had forcibly collected his cotton during their rule, so he was afraid of "public officials" when he saw them, afraid of not being paid. The Branch Secretary helped him understand these two problems. He knew that the People's Government had always protected the interests of cotton farmers, and he knew that selling cotton to the country could also realize his plan to buy a mule or buy grain. He sold all the 700 jin of cotton and actively helped cadres mobilize other cotton farmers to sell cotton. Another cotton farmer, Wang Chouzi, had 500 jin of cotton and refused to sell it. Later, after careful investigation, it was found that he had been plundered by the "big scales" of the Kuomintang reactionary government's flower collectors in the past and did not believe in "public officials." The cadres explained to him that the current People's Government would never deceive the farmers, and let him take a small amount of cotton to try to sell. Finally, seeing that the weighing comrades were very fair, he sold all 500 jin. In addition, some people are afraid of being borrowed money, afraid of making donations, and afraid of being "struggled" in the future. They sold after the individual clarified their thoughts and dispelled their concerns. However, in some villages, only general principles are discussed at the meetings (this principle certainly needs to be clarified), and the specific concerns of each person are not investigated or resolved, resulting in the masses not daring to openly sell cotton. Shang Mao Yi Jian Village, Anyang, is an example of cotton farmers secretly selling more than 10,000 jin of cotton to private merchants during the initial mobilization period.

　　安阳专区购棉储棉工作中的几个问题
　　康伟中
    平原省安阳专区的购棉储棉工作于六月下旬开始布置到村，各县都召开了区村干部会议、各界代表会议和棉农座谈会，进行了爱国主义的思想教育，提高干部与棉农的政治觉悟，并培养带头卖棉的积极分子。接着各级领导机关都统一组织了干部力量，深入农村，配合村干部，全面发动群众，展开售棉储棉运动。据中共安阳地委统计，全区截至七月五日，共收皮棉八十万斤，完成该区此次购棉储棉总任务（四百万斤）的五分之一。现在这一运动仍在继续开展。
  要正确地宣传政务院关于购棉储棉工作的指示
    一般说来，安阳专区是正确贯彻了政务院关于购棉储棉工作的指示的。但在具体执行中，则有一部分基层干部做出了偏差。比如，汤阴县南张王基点村干部给群众传达时说：“目前全国工厂已经停工，国家急需棉花，政府号召咱们献出棉花，我们应该献棉花，爱国家。”棉农因此误认为国家不是购棉，而是要大家捐棉；有的棉农也报出了一点，但都报得很少，多半是一两、二两、四两、半斤。北张王村十六户棉农，共报棉花半斤。有的村干部回村后，仅在大会上对农民进行了一次应该爱国的讲话，而在会后个别动员时，都是强调农民个人的利益，算经济账，说价钱，说利息，说存在家里要自己操心，可能着火，老鼠咬，腐烂等。农民因为认识不清国家与个人利益的一致性，光看见干部挺着急，便越发想着棉花要涨价，犹疑不卖。有的棉农甚至说：“要发家，保存花。”汤阴一区南陈王村棉农杨好智说：“咱种棉花几十年，从来未看到政府派专人来咱村买棉花；这次十几个干部来村动员卖棉，棉价一定要大涨，等一等吧！”这样，他的棉花一点也没有卖出。安阳九区下毛义涧在个别宣传动员时，也因强调算经济账，单纯讲个人利益使棉农发生同样心理，大多数报得很少。另外，有的干部在宣传购棉储棉工作中，结合宣传捐献飞机大炮。但两件工作的关系没有讲清，使棉农误认为卖出棉花，就要全部或大部捐献，因而心怀顾虑，不肯出卖。安阳六区西高平村估计棉农存棉两万斤，只报了五十斤，主要原因就在这里。这些都说明：在贯彻购棉储棉指示中，必须给基层干部讲清道理，讲清政策，使他们把政策的精神搞通。否则在向群众进行宣传时，就会发生讲错、讲不明白、或者精神不对头的现象，对运动发生很不好的影响。
    该专区为克服这些现象，目前已以地委、县委机关干部为主、组成千余人的检查小组，分头深入农村，进行检查。发现有些地方在贯彻政策有偏向时，即重补一课，以解除因政策交待不清而发生的各种群众性的思想顾虑与误会，促进购棉储棉任务及早完成。
  纠正区村干部盲目乐观或盲目悲观的偏向
    目前安阳专区部分区村干部思想上存在着两种偏向。一种是满足于表面的轰轰烈烈，稍有成绩，即表现盲目的乐观，甚至认为任务已经完成，因此放松了领导。另一种是盲目地认为任务太大，工作中困难太多，没有足够的信心来完成任务。
    前一种情形，大半是这样发生的：在区村干部回村召开了支部会、干部会、妇女会、棉农座谈会及群众大会，初步进行了爱国主义思想教育之后，某些积极分子纷纷自报存棉，表面上轰轰烈烈，干部便以为运动起来了，棉花全部或大部都卖出来了。但深入检查，却往往发现以多报少，存棉还多，有的甚至只是报了一个零头。
    后一种情形，也是由于缺乏深入的调查和宣传工作，心里不摸底，因而产生盲目的悲观情绪。汤阴县不少区村干部在回村开了几次动员大会之后，群众没有动静，就泄气地说：“反正我完不成购棉储棉任务，让上级批评处分我吧！”安阳九区区委书记在购棉储棉工作刚布置下去时就表示：“分配的任务无论如何不能完成，自己尽力作就对了。”克服的办法，应该是教育和帮助他们进行深入的宣传和调查工作，掌握材料，提高信心。
  政治动员要与物资供应及收购业务相结合
    在购棉储棉中，政治动员必须与物资供应相结合。国家规定了许多照顾棉农利益的办法，如适当的价格和棉农所需要的物资的供应等，必须使之切实兑现。有许多棉农这样发问：“说的这样好，能不能办到呢？”他们怕“爱国售棉少给钱”，怕秤不公道，怕卖了棉不能立即买到需要的物资。安阳西八里庄棉农崔金荣卖棉时，曾先拿四十斤去试一下。待实际拿到麦票后，就把所有的三百斤棉全部卖了。接着他又以自己的经验去告诉四户邻居，让他们把存棉五百斤也都卖出。清峪村中共支部书记动员农民卖棉时，也是让大家到水冶棉站先试试看。农民看到棉站秤公道，算账快，招待好，回去一宣传，全村一天就送到棉站四千斤棉花。
    根据该专区经验，经济工作上主要应掌握两点：一、除收棉站外，还要大量组织流动收棉小组。目前全区已有十八个收棉小组，还在继续组织中。流动收棉小组给了群众很大方便：因为正是农忙季节，使群众不用出村便能卖出棉花，换回必需品。秦村在收购小组未到以前，五、六天只报了四百斤；但经收棉小组下乡当场收了棉花交给群众粮票、煤票、现款、储蓄证，半天即收花三千五百斤。二、必须自上而下的组织检查，严格经济纪律。因为有些经济干部还有不问政治的倾向，这一点就更应当十分注意。为此，地委和专署专门组织了十几个干部到各个收棉站进行检查，作用甚大。但最近仍发现上毛义涧购棉站存在着许多问题：如粮款不够也不及时报上级解决；给群众开条不盖章，群众凭没章条子不能取粮；有的群众卖点棉花，要在棉栈等两三天。现专署财政经济委员会正进行改进中。
  一般的宣传动员必须与个别的宣传动员相结合
    安阳专区的经验证明，一般的宣传“爱国家、卖棉花”的道理，只能初步解决棉农个人与国家的关系问题。但棉农真正要拿出棉花时，还有许多具体的顾虑，各个人都不一样。不经过个别的宣传去解决各个人的具体顾虑，棉花还是拿不出来，或者拿出的数目很少。安阳九区梁张村棉农马立柱有七百多斤棉花，一直不肯卖。经过该村中共支部书记和他深入谈心，才知道他思想上有两个问题：一个是自己有个买骡子的计划，想等阴历“七月七”看看新棉花保住了就卖棉花，买个大骡子；棉苗如果不好，就买粮食。现在不想卖。另一个问题，是日寇统治时曾经强征过他的棉花，所以一见“公家人”就害怕，怕不给钱。支部书记帮助他把这两个问题想通后，他知道了人民政府历来保护棉农利益，知道了把棉花卖给国家也能实现自己的买骡子或买粮食的计划，就把七百多斤棉花都卖了；并且积极帮助干部动员其他棉农售棉。另一棉农王臭子有棉五百斤，不肯卖。后来仔细调查，才知他过去受过国民党反动政府收花人员“大秤”的掠夺，不相信“公家人”。干部们一面给他解释现在的人民政府决不欺哄农民，一面让他拿少数棉花去试卖。最后看到司秤的同志非常公正，就把五百斤都卖了。此外，有的人怕人家向他借钱，怕捐献，怕将来还要“斗争”，都是在个别的打通思想、解除顾虑之后才卖了出来。但是，也有一部分村庄，只是在会议上讲一般道理（这道理当然需要讲清），不调查、解决各人的具体顾虑，结果群众不敢公开卖棉。安阳上毛义涧村棉农在最初动员期间两天内偷偷卖给私商棉花万余斤，即是一例。
