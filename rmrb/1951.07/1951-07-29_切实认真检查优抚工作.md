Earnestly and Conscientiously Inspect Preferential Treatment Work
    Xiong Tianjing, Director of the Preferential Treatment Department of the Central Ministry of Internal Affairs

    The General Association of the Chinese People's Resistance Against U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea issued a call on June 1st to strengthen preferential treatment work. In a notice on July 4th, it further "called on all cities and villages across the country to conduct a comprehensive and practical inspection of the status of preferential treatment and pensions within a week before and after this year's 'August 1st' Army Day of the People's Liberation Army, and to launch a mass preferential treatment campaign." This is extremely necessary. We, the personnel engaged in preferential treatment work, should mobilize the people to assist the government in thoroughly completing this inspection work.

    Our preferential treatment work has always been successful. Preferential treatment work has played a significant role in boosting morale, strengthening the armed forces, and consolidating national defense. The broad masses of people warmly support the people's armed forces—the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army—care for their families in various ways, solve the difficulties of their families in production and life, and give them a lofty status politically. However, in some places, because the cadres have not explained these principles in detail to the people, some people do not fully understand why they should give preferential treatment and pensions to the families of revolutionary martyrs and disabled veterans, and a mass, conscious preferential treatment movement has not been formed. Some places believe that preferential treatment work is only a matter for the civil affairs departments, and it is rarely discussed at government meetings, so it does not receive the cooperation of other departments. The employment, production, and education of the families of revolutionary martyrs and disabled veterans have not been well resolved. In some places, the preferential treatment work relies entirely on the government, forgetting to mobilize the masses, and the work has not been done well. The reason for these shortcomings is that some of our cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the basic idea that preferential treatment work is a long-term political task and that social forces should be organized and mobilized to do a good job in preferential treatment work. They are not good at integrating preferential treatment work with the current central work, and they have not paid widespread attention to organizing and educating the families of revolutionary martyrs and disabled veterans to participate in national construction and make them positive factors. This has caused preferential treatment work to lag behind the requirements of the objective situation. In order to overcome shortcomings and improve work, we believe that in-depth inspections must be carried out.

    How should the inspection be carried out? The following points should be emphasized:

    First, it should be checked whether the leading organs at all levels attach importance to preferential treatment work? How do they coordinate with relevant departments and people's organizations to carry out preferential treatment work in conjunction with the central work? Have the people's representative conferences at all levels discussed preferential treatment work and made resolutions? Has the government committee at all levels discussed the implementation measures and frequently supervised, inspected, and summarized experiences? Have the families of revolutionary martyrs and disabled veterans truly enjoyed the various preferential treatments given to them by the state and society? Has a universal and in-depth preferential treatment education been carried out among the broad masses of the people, so that the people can recognize the importance of the people's armed forces, thereby consciously and willingly giving preferential treatment and respecting the families of revolutionary martyrs and disabled veterans, and transforming preferential treatment work into a mass movement?

    Second, the leading departments at all levels can first select several districts or townships for in-depth inspection in order to discover problems and promote experience. Can we check how the substitute farming is organized? What is the effect? Has a movement to give preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs been launched? What is the method? Has attention been paid to the enrollment of children of revolutionary martyrs, employment issues, and political treatment issues? Has the employment and production of disabled veterans and the establishment of families been started? The preferential treatment work in cities should also be inspected with emphasis.

    Third, it should be checked whether the governments at all levels have convened meetings of the families of revolutionary martyrs and disabled veterans, or model representative meetings to support the army and give preferential treatment to families, in a timely and prepared manner, with the county or district and township as the unit, to solicit opinions, summarize experiences, commend models, and establish banners. The experience of many places has proved that holding such meetings is of great help in discovering problems in preferential treatment work.

    Fourth, it should be checked whether the local governments have mobilized the broad masses of people to frequently visit and comfort the families of revolutionary martyrs and disabled veterans, help them learn politics and culture, and help them communicate with the front lines? Because they receive the care and comfort of the revolutionary big family, they can give more play to their revolutionary enthusiasm and become a force for consolidating national defense and participating in national construction.

　　切实认真检查优抚工作
    中央内务部优抚司司长　熊天荆
    中国人民抗美援朝总会六月一日号召加强优抚工作。七月四日的通知中，更“号召全国所有的城市和乡村，在今年‘八一’人民解放军建军节之前后各一个星期内，对优待和抚恤工作状况，作一次普遍的切实的检查，开展群众性的优抚运动”。这是非常必要的。我们从事优抚工作的工作人员，应该发动人民群众协助政府彻底完成这一检查工作。
    我们的优抚工作从来就是做得有成绩的。优抚工作对鼓舞士气，壮大部队，与巩固国防都起了重大作用。广大人民热烈地拥护人民的武装——人民解放军、人民志愿军，多方地照顾他们的家属，解决他们家属在生产、生活中的困难，并在政治上给以崇高的地位。但有的地方，因为干部没有把这些道理详尽地向人民群众进行宣传，一部分群众还不十分了解为什么应该优待与抚恤烈军属及革命残废军人，没有形成群众性的自觉的优抚运动，有些地方以为优抚工作只是民政部门的事，政府会议上很少讨论，因而得不到其他部门的配合，烈军属及革命残废军人的就业、生产、学习等问题也没有得到很好解决。有些地方的优抚工作全靠政府来作，忘记了发动群众，工作也没有作好。产生这些缺点的原因，是因为我们的某些干部对优抚工作是一个长期性的政治任务以及组织、发动社会力量来做好优抚工作这一基本思想认识得不够。他们不善于把优抚工作与当前中心工作结合进行，对于组织与教育烈军属及革命残废军人参加国家建设并使之成为积极因素，尚未引起普遍的注意。这样就使优抚工作落后客观形势的要求。为了克服缺点，改进工作，我们认为，必须进行深入的检查。
    怎样进行检查呢？应着重以下几点：
    第一，应检查各级领导机关是否重视优抚工作？怎样配合各有关部门、人民团体结合中心工作进行优抚工作？各级人民代表会议是否讨论了优抚工作并作出了决议？各级政府委员会是否讨论了实施办法并经常督促检查，总结经验？烈军属及革命残废军人是否真正享受了国家与社会给他们的各种优待？在广大人民群众中曾否进行了普遍而深入的优抚教育，使人民群众认识到人民武装的重要性，从而自觉自愿地优待和尊重烈军属和革命残废军人，把优抚工作变为群众性的运动？
    第二，各级领导部门可先选择几个区或乡进行深入检查，借以发现问题，推广经验。可检查代耕是怎样组织的？效果如何？曾否发动过优待烈军属运动？其方式如何？烈军属子弟入学问题，就业问题，政治待遇问题，是否已注意？革命残废军人的就业生产，建立家务问题，是否已着手解决？城市的优抚工作，也应作重点的检查。
    第三，应当检查各级人民政府是否适时地，有准备地，以县或区、乡为单位召开烈军属、革命残废军人会议，或拥军优属模范代表会议，征求意见，总结经验，表扬模范，树立旗帜。许多地方的经验证明，召开这样的会议，对发现优抚工作中的问题有很大帮助。
    第四，应检查各地政府是否曾发动广大人民群众经常走访和慰问烈军属及革命残废军人，帮助他们学习政治与文化，帮助他们和前方通讯联系？因为他们得到革命大家庭的关怀和安慰，才能更多地发挥革命积极性，成为巩固国防与参加国家建设的力量。
