Xinhua News Agency, New York, July 11th: According to TASS news from New York: On June 30th, approximately twenty unidentified Americans arrived in front of the office of the Soviet Delegation to the United Nations in New York. They harbored obvious hostility, spewing malicious words and clamoring, interfering with people entering and leaving the delegation office, and using sharp instruments to make countless deep scratches on the delegation's two cars parked in front of the office. While these people were engaging in harassment, American police officers who had come with them were present. The Soviet Representative to the United Nations, Malik, wrote a letter to the United States Representative to the United Nations, Austin, on July 3rd, lodging a serious protest regarding this matter. In his letter, Malik demanded that Austin "immediately take appropriate measures to investigate and punish the people who clamored and shouted in front of the Soviet delegation's office on June 30th, compensate for the losses they caused, and take measures to prevent such incidents from recurring."

However, on the afternoon of July 7th, another sixty to eighty unidentified people arrived in front of the Soviet Union's United Nations office and conducted the same harassment. Prior to the arrival of this group, a special detachment of American police officers arrived on the scene in advance and remained there watching them engage in wanton harassment, which shows that the American authorities were aware of this matter beforehand. The Acting Representative of the Soviet Union to the United Nations, Tsarapkin, wrote to the American Representative Austin again on July 9th, pointing out: "The recurrence of this harassing action hostile to the Delegation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to the United Nations proves that the American authorities have not taken the appropriate measures requested by the delegation in its letter of July 3rd." Tsarapkin reiterated the demands made in the letter of July 3rd in his letter.

　　苏代表团致函奥斯汀抗议美政府纵容行凶
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社纽约消息：六月三十日，约有二十个来历不明的美国人到纽约苏联驻联合国代表团办事处的门前，怀着明显的敌意，口出恶言，喧嚷叫骂，干涉进出代表团办事处的人们，并手持利器在停在办事处门前的代表团两辆汽车身上刺划无数深痕。当这些人在进行滋扰时，有和他们一同来的美国警察在场。苏联驻联合国代表马立克在七月三日写信给美国驻联合国代表奥斯汀，就此事提出严重抗议。马立克在信中要求奥斯汀“立即采取适当的措施，调查并惩处六月三十日在苏联代表团办事处门前喧嚷叫嚣的人，赔偿他们所造成的损失，并采取措施使这种事情不再重演”。
    但是到七月七日下午，又有六十个至八十个来历不明的人到苏联驻联合国办事处门前进行同样的滋扰。而在这批人到达以前，就有美国警察特派队先行到场，并一直在场看着他们肆意滋扰，这显示了美国当局是预先知道这件事情的。苏联驻联合国代理代表查拉普金特于七月九日再度写信给美国代表奥斯汀，指出：“这种敌视苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟驻联合国代表团的滋扰行动的重演，证明美国当局没有采取代表团在七月三日的信中所要求采取的适当措施。”查拉普金在信中重申七月三日信中所提出的要求。
