　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 19th: The newspaper "Labor News" stated in an article entitled "South Korean Economy Collapses, People Impoverished": When the American interventionists launched their aggression against Korea, they were confident they could seize all of Korea's wealth and turn the Korean people into slaves of American capitalists. However, the heroic resistance of the peace-loving Korean people shattered this plan.

　　The newspaper further described the consequences of the American interventionists' rule in South Korea in the years before launching the aggression. Some American sources estimate that the level of South Korean industrial output is only 20 percent of what it was before World War II. In the metal manufacturing industry, only 5 percent of enterprises are operating. At the outbreak of the Korean War, more than two-thirds of industrial enterprises were shut down, and three million people were unemployed, plunged into hunger and death.

　　The newspaper pointed out that American intervention caused great damage to industry. Many factories were dismantled, and equipment was either damaged or shipped to Japan by the Americans. In Seoul alone, 785 enterprises were burned down and bombed. When the American interventionists withdrew from Seoul, they shipped the equipment of dozens of factories to Japan. South Korean mines have all ceased operations.

　　The agricultural situation in South Korea, which has always been known as Korea's main granary, is particularly serious. This year's sown area is almost 30 to 40 percent less than in 1949. The war has further damaged agricultural production. Farmers have been driven from their homes and subjected to terrible plunder by landlords, usurers, and the local authorities of the Syngman Rhee government, making it impossible for them to cultivate the land. Last year, the total harvest was particularly low. However, the Syngman Rhee government still used intimidation and violence to plunder the last bit of rice stored by the farmers. The threat of a terrible famine looms over South Korea. Before the outbreak of the war, thousands of residents withered and died, and now it is difficult to even calculate the number of people who die of starvation each month.

　　The American interventionists and the Syngman Rhee bandit army forced residents to evacuate, leaving tens of thousands of people to spend the night in the open air, suffering from disease and chronic death. The roads in South Korea are crowded with groups of ragged and hungry refugees.

　　"Labor News" said: The collapse of the South Korean economy has caused the prices of food and major necessities to skyrocket, bringing deep suffering to the people. Trade is in a state of great chaos, and the prices of rice and other grains are constantly rising.

　　Road bridges and public buildings have been greatly damaged, most of which were destroyed by American demolition personnel and bombers. In Seoul alone, 118,000 houses were burned down and bombed by the Americans.

　　Constant inflation has had a particularly disastrous impact on the South Korean economy. The Syngman Rhee government is taking brutal measures to levy new taxes on the people to make up for the budget deficit. In 1950 alone, the puppet government revised the budget five times, increasing it. Under the pretext of "wartime needs," the South Korean puppet government levied extra taxes on the people, which amounted to 140 percent of the original taxes set for 1950.

　　"Labor News" concluded by pointing out that the people of southern Korea are resolutely resisting the measures taken by the American and Li bandit gangs to plunder the people, and are organizing a struggle against the interventionists and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang.

### 在美李匪帮长期掠夺和破坏下　南朝鲜经济崩溃　人民陷于饥饿与死亡境地

　　在美李匪帮长期掠夺和破坏下
　　南朝鲜经济崩溃
　　人民陷于饥饿与死亡境地
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社平壤十七日讯：《劳动新闻》在一篇题为《南朝鲜经济崩溃人民贫穷》的文章中说：美国干涉者对朝鲜发动侵略时，满以为可以将整个朝鲜的财富拿过去，并将朝鲜人民变为美国资本家的奴隶。可是，爱好和平的朝鲜人民的英勇抵抗，粉碎了这个计划。
    该报进一步叙述美国干涉者在发动侵略以前几年中统治南朝鲜的后果。某些美国人士估计，南朝鲜的工业产量水平只抵二次大战以前的百分之二十。在金属制造业中，只有百分之五的企业开工。朝鲜战争爆发时，有三分之二以上的工业企业停工，有三百万人没有工作，陷于饥饿与死亡的境地。
    该报指出：美国的干涉使工业受到了很大的破坏。许多工厂都被拆毁了，设备不是被打坏，就是被美国人运到日本去。仅在汉城一地，就有七百八十五家企业被放火烧毁和炸毁。美国干涉者从汉城撤退时，把几十个工厂的设备都运到日本去了。南朝鲜的矿山都停了工。
    一向以朝鲜主要谷仓著名的南朝鲜的农业状况，尤其严重。今年播种的面积差不多比一九四九年少百分之三十到四十。战争使农业生产进一步受到破坏。农民从家乡被赶出去，并遭受地主、高利贷者和李承晚政府地方当局的可怕的掠夺，根本不能进行耕种。去年，总收成特别低。但是，李承晚政府仍然用威吓和暴力，把农民储藏的最后一点大米掠夺一空。可怕的饥荒的威胁笼罩着南朝鲜。战争爆发以前，成千居民憔悴而死，而现在，连计算一下每月饿死的人数，都很困难。
    美国干涉者和李承晚伪匪军强迫居民撤退，使成千成万的人民在露天下过宿，遭受疾病和慢性死亡。在南朝鲜的道路上，挤满了成群的衣服破烂和饥饿的难民。
    《劳动新闻》说：南朝鲜经济的崩溃已经使粮食和主要必需品的价格漫天高涨，给人民带来了深重的苦难。贸易处于非常混乱的状态，大米和其他粮食的价格正在不断上涨。
    公路桥梁和公共建筑已经大受破坏，大部分都是被美国破坏人员和轰炸机破坏的。单在汉城，就有十一万八千所房子被美国人烧毁和炸毁了。
    不断的通货膨胀对南朝鲜的经济有特别灾难性的影响。李承晚政府正采取残酷的措施，向人民强征新税，来弥补预算的赤字。在一九五○年一年中，傀儡政府曾五次修改预算，把预算增加。在“战时需要”的借口下，南朝鲜傀儡政府向人民强征额外捐税，这种捐税为一九五○年原定的捐税数目的百分之一百四十。
    《劳动新闻》在结语中指出：朝鲜南部的人民正坚决抵抗美、李匪帮掠夺人民的一切措施，并正组织反对干涉者和李承晚匪帮的斗争。
