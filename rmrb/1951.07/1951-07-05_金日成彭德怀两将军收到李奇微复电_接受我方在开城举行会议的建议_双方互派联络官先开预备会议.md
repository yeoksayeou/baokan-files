　　Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai Received Ridgway's Reply
    Accepting Our Suggestion to Hold Meetings in Kaesong
    Both Sides Will Send Liaison Officers to Hold Preliminary Meetings First
    [Xinhua News Agency, 4th] Frontline in Korea Dispatch: This office has received a reply from Ridgway, agreeing to hold a meeting in Kaesong on July 10th. He also suggested that both sides send liaison officers to hold a preliminary meeting beforehand to discuss the details of the meeting. Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai have replied today, agreeing to this.
    The following is the reply: General Ridgway:
    We have received your reply of July 3rd. In order to ensure the effective arrangement of many details regarding the first meeting of the representatives of both sides, we agree to your suggestion that both sides send three liaison officers each to hold a preliminary meeting in the Kaesong area. If you agree, we suggest that the meeting time for the liaison officers of both sides be set for July 8th. We have notified our commanders in the Kaesong area regarding preparations for receiving your liaison officers.
                                 Commander-in-Chief of the Korean People's Army, Kim Il-sung
                                   Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, Peng Dehuai
                                            July 4, 1951
    [Xinhua News Agency, 4th] Ridgway's reply is as follows: General Kim Il-sung: General Peng Dehuai:
    I have received your reply to my telegram of June 30th. I am prepared to send my representatives to meet with your representatives in Kaesong on July 10th, or earlier, if your representatives can complete preparations before that day. Since an agreement on armistice conditions must precede the cessation of hostilities, delaying the meeting or delaying reaching an agreement will prolong the fighting and increase losses. In order to ensure the effective arrangement of many details regarding the first meeting, I propose that no more than three of my liaison officers meet with an equal number of your liaison officers in Kaesong on July 5th, or as soon as practically possible after that date. If you agree, my liaison officers (the highest-ranking of whom will not exceed the rank of colonel) will depart from Kimpo Airport, southwest of Seoul, via helicopter at 23:00 Greenwich time on July 4th, or 09:00 Tokyo time on July 5th, or at the same time on another day agreed upon by both sides for holding this meeting, and fly directly to Kaesong. If the weather is bad, these officers will travel in a convoy of three one-and-a-quarter-ton unarmed vehicles, commonly known as jeeps, along the main road from Seoul to Kaesong. Each vehicle will display a large white flag. The convoy will cross the Imjin River on the road from Seoul to Kaesong at approximately 23:00 Greenwich time on July 4th, or 09:00 Tokyo time on July 5th, or at the same time on another day agreed upon by both sides for holding this meeting. If you inform me of the route, time, and easily identifiable convoy formation for the convoy carrying your liaison officers, the convoy will be guaranteed immunity from attack by my forces on the way to or from the meeting. I look forward to receiving your reply. Commander-in-Chief, United Nations Command, Ridgway
                                             July 3rd, 14:30
