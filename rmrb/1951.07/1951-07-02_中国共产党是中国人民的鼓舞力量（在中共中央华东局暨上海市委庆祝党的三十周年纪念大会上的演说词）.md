Today, on the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese Communist Party has risen to an unprecedentedly lofty position in the hearts of the people. This is due to the Chinese Communist Party's adherence to serving the people and its unwavering confidence in the power of the people.

The Chinese Communist Party has gained unparalleled respect from the masses of all strata, and it has inspired a love for our motherland that the people have never had before. I will cite just one example:

During the Anti-Japanese War, there were constant appeals for our medical personnel to serve the soldiers on the front lines in the struggle against the invaders. The response to these calls was very lukewarm. The vast majority of doctors, nurses, and other technicians lingered in the cities, engaging in lucrative businesses, forgetting the suffering of the wounded. How different the situation is today! When our motherland is once again threatened by imperialist aggression, doctors, nurses, and others immediately answer the call, following the ranks of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers to rescue and treat the wounded and sick of the heroic Korean People's Army. This vast difference in attitude and action is directly due to our heartfelt support for the Party that leads our People's Government, a heartfelt support that can now be said to be nationwide.

It is worth studying why the Chinese Communist Party can awaken our sense of responsibility.

First of all, we know that the Chinese Communist Party is close to the worker-peasant masses. In fact, the Chinese Communist Party is part of the worker-peasant masses. It thoroughly understands them, and all its actions are for them. Therefore, when the Chinese Communist Party takes action, it receives the sympathy and support of the broad masses of the people.

The second cornerstone of the Chinese Communist Party's success is its united front policy. By clearly distinguishing between friends and enemies in all aspects—between individuals, between parties, and between countries—it has consolidated all domestic democratic forces and international forces friendly to China. This policy is the foundation for us to give relentless blows to the enemies of the people and to obtain the sincere cooperation of all our friends. This policy has achieved repeated victories in the past and will continue to achieve victories in the future.

Starting from the second basic viewpoint, the historical achievements of the Chinese Communist Party and its members have set an example for us. We learn from them how to face our mistakes squarely and how to resolutely correct them. We learn from them the value of continuous learning and the necessity of raising the political and cultural levels of ourselves and the entire country. We experience from them the meaning of loving the motherland and making the greatest contribution to the motherland.

In other words, the main factor in the success of the Chinese revolution is the policies and unremitting efforts of the Chinese Communist Party under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong.

The tasks currently facing our motherland are as arduous as they were when we achieved revolutionary victory. In fact, this is a continuation of the revolutionary struggle. First, we must defend our motherland and our neighbors from imperialist aggression. Second, we must consolidate and further develop the people's power throughout the country. Third, we must continue to steadily advance the construction of our motherland. In order to correctly implement these tasks, we need to rely on the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The widespread celebration of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party will show how broad the masses support the Communist Party, and how powerful the masses have been inspired by the Communist Party's self-sacrifice and firm belief. Such great unity is destined to enable New China to overcome all difficulties and achieve the greatest success in national construction. These successes will further strengthen the force in the struggle to defend world peace.

Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
Long live Chairman Mao, the leader of the Chinese people!

    中国共产党是中国人民的鼓舞力量
  （在中共中央华东局暨上海市委庆祝党的三十周年纪念大会上的演说词）
    宋庆龄
    在中国共产党成立三十周年纪念的今天，中国共产党在人民的心目中已经上升到空前崇高的地位。这是由于中国共产党坚持着为人民服务以及它对于人民力量坚决不移的信心。
    中国共产党已经从各阶层群众里获得了无比的尊敬，它激发了我们祖国对人民从来没有过的热爱，我仅举一个例子：
    在抗日战争时期，曾经有不断的呼吁要我国的医务人员在反抗侵略者的斗争中，为前线的士兵服务。对这些号召的反应，真是冷落得很，绝大部分的医生护士和其他技术人员们留恋在都市里，做着获利丰厚的业务，忘记了伤员们的痛苦，今天的情形是多么不同啊！当我们的祖国再度受到帝国主义侵略的威胁的时候，医生、护士和其他的人们，立刻回答了号召，随着英勇的中国人民志愿军的队伍，去救护和医疗他们以及英勇的朝鲜人民军的伤病员了。这种态度上和行动上的大不相同，是直接由于我们现在对领导我们人民政府的党的衷心拥护，这种衷心拥护现在可以说是全国一致的了。
    为什么中国共产党能够唤起我们大家的责任感，这是值得研究的。
    首先我们知道，中国共产党是接近工农大众的，事实上，中国共产党就是工农大众的一部分，它彻底了解他们，而它的一切行动，也都是为了他们，因此当中国共产党有所行动时，它就得到广大人民群众的同情和拥护。
    中国共产党成功的第二个基石，是他的统一战线政策，由于在各方面——个人与个人之间，党派与党派之间，国家与国家之间，这样分清了友和敌，已经巩固了所有国内民主力量，以及国际上的对中国友好的力量。这个政策是我们对人民的敌人给以无情的打击，和取得了一切朋友们的真诚合作的基础，这个政策在过去已经取得了一再的胜利，在将来还是要同样取得胜利。
    从第二个基本观点出发，中国共产党和他的党员们的历史性的成就，已经给我们树立了榜样，我们从他们学习如何正视自己的错误，以及如何坚决加以纠正，我们从他们知道了不断学习的宝贵，以及提高我们个人和整个国家的政治和文化水准的必要，我们从他们体验到热爱祖国和为祖国作最大贡献的意义。
    换一句话说，中国革命成功的主要因素，是在毛泽东主席领导下的中国共产党的政策和坚持不懈的努力。
    目前我们祖国面临的任务，正如在取得革命胜利时一样的艰巨。实际上，这就是革命斗争的延续。首先我们要保卫我们祖国和我们的邻邦不受到帝国主义的侵略。第二，我们要在全国范围内巩固和进一步发展人民的政权。第三，我们要继续稳步推进我们祖国的建设，为了正确地贯彻这样的任务，我们就需要依靠中国共产党的领导。对于中国共产党建党三十周年纪念的广泛庆祝，会显示出共产党是有着多么广大的群众的拥护，以及广大群众从共产党的自我牺牲和坚定信仰，获得了何等有力的鼓舞，这样伟大的团结注定了新中国将克服一切困难，达到国家建设中的最大成功，有了这些成功将会更加强保卫世界和平斗争中的力量。
    中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民的领袖毛主席万岁！
