To the Editor:

I found an article entitled "Paul Korchagin and Wu Xun" by Mr. Sun Yu in the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao's "Weekend Drama" on January 20th of this year. Although this is a short article of only three hundred words, I think its poison is very deep.

In this article, the author stubbornly equates Wu Xun, a reactionary, vile, and utterly shameless person, with Paul Korchagin, a heroic and tenacious proletarian fighter. Undeniably, the technique and content of this article are extremely despicable, because the author is not praising Paul, but distorting Paul, and deliberately using Paul to praise Wu Xun.

We know that Paul and Wu Xun are, respectively, a revolutionary hero and a shameless slave. Paul has deep and unwavering class hatred. He believes that the landlords' young masters and young ladies "have no heart at all," and "my fists itch when I see these people." He was also subjected to beatings and scoldings by the shameless ruling class, but what attitude did he take? "He calls me a stinking beggar, and I beat him!" This is Paul's heroic response. Paul also realized from the life practice of the poor: "Our life is not well arranged." He needs to create a reasonable life, he wants to wage a merciless struggle against the reactionary rulers; he dedicated his life to the revolution, and even when he was paralyzed and blind, he was still infinitely loyal to the revolutionary cause!

However, let us look at the attitude that Wu Xun, as praised by Mr. Sun Yu, takes towards the beatings and scoldings given by the class enemy. He endures it shamelessly. His answer is to kowtow, kneel, smile obsequiously, and beg for money. Wu Xun ran schools to consolidate the feudal order. Wu Xun was not only indifferent to the revolution, but also slandered it.

In particular, the author's last sentence in the article: "In the surging tide of patriotism, Paul Korchagin and Wu Xun are two brilliant examples in Europe and Asia," is even more intolerable! He seems to have forgotten the great achievements created by the countless martyrs who heroically sacrificed themselves for the cause of human liberation in the people's liberation struggle in Asia, especially in the revolutionary struggle led by the Chinese Communist Party. He seems to think that none of these people are worthy of being examples for mankind, and only the reactionary and shameless Wu Xun is.

After the criticism of the film "The Life of Wu Xun" unfolded, I felt that Mr. Sun Yu's self-criticism was not profound enough. When I read this article, I felt that he needed to make a new self-criticism.

### 孙瑜拿保尔与武训相比是污辱了英雄的保尔

  　孙瑜拿保尔与武训相比是污辱了英雄的保尔编辑同志：
    在本年一月二十日上海大公报《周末影剧》上，发现了一篇孙瑜先生的《保尔·柯察金与武训》一文。这虽是一篇三百多字的短文，可是我认为他的毒素也是很深的。
    在这篇文中，作者硬把武训这样一个反动、卑劣、无耻透顶的人，与英勇顽强的无产阶级战士保尔·柯察金相提并论。无可置疑的，这篇文章的手法和内容都是极其卑劣的，因为作者不是歌颂保尔，而是歪曲保尔，而是蓄意借保尔来歌颂武训。
    我们知道，保尔和武训一个是革命的英雄，一个是无耻的奴才。保尔有着深切的无可动摇的阶级仇恨。他认为地主的少爷小姐们“根本没有人心”，他“见了这些人拳头就痒痒”。他也遭受到无耻的统治阶级的打骂，但是他是采取什么态度呢？“他骂我臭要饭的，我就打他！”这就是保尔英勇的回答。保尔又从穷人的生活实践中认识到：“我们的生活，安排得不好。”他需要创造合理的生活，他要对反动统治者作无情的斗争；把自己生命献给了革命，直到他身体瘫痪，双目失明了，还是无限忠诚地为着革命事业奋斗！
    但是，我们再来看看如孙瑜先生所歌颂的武训对于阶级敌人所给予的打骂，却是采取什么态度呢？他是无耻的忍受。他的回答是叩头、下跪、陪笑、要钱。武训办学是为了巩固封建秩序。武训对于革命不但无动于衷，反而污蔑它。
    特别是作者在文章最后说：“在澎湃高涨的爱国主义热潮中，保尔·柯察金和武训是欧亚两个辉煌的榜样”，更是令人难以容忍！他似乎忘了在亚洲的人民解放斗争中，尤其是在中国共产党所领导的革命斗争中，多少为人类解放事业英勇牺牲的烈士所创造的伟绩。他似乎认为这些人都不堪称人类的榜样，而只有反动无耻的武训才是。
    在电影《武训传》的批判展开之后，我觉得孙瑜先生的检讨是不深刻的，在我读到这篇文章时，更觉得他须要重作检讨的了。
