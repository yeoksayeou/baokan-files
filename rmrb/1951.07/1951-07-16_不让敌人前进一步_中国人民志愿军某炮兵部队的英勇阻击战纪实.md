	Not Letting the Enemy Advance a Single Step
	——A Record of a Heroic Blocking Action by a Certain Artillery Unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
	Li Yuzhu
	On May 25th, just after the conclusion of the Fifth Campaign, the American aggressors, having suffered heavy blows, brazenly gathered the US Third Division, the Twenty-Fourth Division, and the Canadian "Royal Infantry Regiment" and other troops, advancing in three routes towards our position in a risky attempt to cover up the truth of their defeat. However, the enemy's plan was completely smashed by a certain division of our Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The enemy's so-called central route, in the area of Zhibu-ri, was blocked by this division for six days and nights, not advancing a single step, but instead retreating more than twenty *li*, and paying the price of the lives of three thousand officers and soldiers, dozens of tanks and vehicles, two aircraft, as well as tens of thousands of howitzer shells and several tons of bombs.
	On the evening of the 28th, the soldiers of a certain artillery unit of our artillery force were busy tidying up their equipment and tools when they suddenly received the order: "Enter the position and shell the enemy!" The soldiers were overjoyed upon hearing this, only fearing that there wouldn't be enough time. So everyone stepped up their preparations and set off immediately. Regardless of enemy aircraft circling for reconnaissance, dropping flares everywhere, strafing, and bombing, the soldiers arrived at their destination on time and quickly entered their positions, completing all camouflage, fortifications, and firing preparations before dawn. Everyone was waiting for the opportunity with joy in their hearts, "Let the American devils taste the flavor of our shells!"
	The soldiers of the first gun position, apart from squad leader Shao Zhenjia and deputy squad leader Li Deyuan, were all new recruits with no combat experience and lacked confidence, fearing that they would not be able to complete their tasks well when the fighting started. "Will we be able to operate as skillfully as we do in peacetime when the fighting starts?" "Will I be able to pull the firing pin well?" "Will I be able to keep up with the loading?" Everyone had been pondering these questions all the way while marching. Comrade Shao Zhenjia saw this situation and mobilized everyone, saying: "This is the time to test us, the time to win glory for the motherland, and the time to realize our determination." At the same time, Shao Zhenjia gave a brief and concise explanation of the battlefield actions and precautions that should be taken, so as to dispel everyone's concerns and better exert their combat effectiveness.
	It dawned. The comrades had eaten and took turns resting to recover from the fatigue of not sleeping all night. Near ten o'clock, dark clouds suddenly gathered and it poured with rain. The soldiers couldn't sleep anymore and only hoped that the command post would give the order immediately to open fire on the enemy while it was raining. Sure enough, a little after ten o'clock, the order came down: "The entire company will fire in the direction directly ahead." The first gun position fired dozens of shells in less than three minutes. In peacetime drills, the soldiers could only fire ×× shells per minute, but now they had reached a firing rate of double that per minute, causing the enemy to flee in panic. The infantry brothers in front clapped and cheered with joy. After a while, the command post called and said: "An enemy battalion has collapsed, and the cars have all been destroyed."
	At dusk, the artillery team was ordered to move its position to another location. The soldiers quickly moved over, hurriedly built fortifications, and prepared for another battle the next day. Each person dug a single-person trench and added a cover, preparing to rest inside when there was no fighting. At dinner, everyone happily talked about the day's battle. Some said: "It's been more than two months since we came abroad, and we've been troubled by enemy planes every day, but today we finally vented our anger." Immediately, someone disagreed: "Is this considered venting our anger? No, this is just the beginning!"
	The squad leader convened a meeting to talk about the day's battle, commended the soldiers who operated nimbly in the battle, and then talked about the lessons learned. He pointed out that the camouflage that day was not good enough. Cao Wensheng, the third gunner, who usually didn't talk much, said: "It's not difficult, isn't it just a little bit of sweat?" Everyone immediately set to work, adding to the fortifications and making the camouflage even more perfect, preparing to give the enemy a bloody nose again the next day.
	There were no battles for a day and two nights, and everyone hoped that the battle order would come down soon. On the third day, still a little after ten o'clock, the command post's phone rang: "There are more than a dozen enemy vehicles in front, one following the other, advancing towards our forward position's small bridge, and there are large numbers of enemies gathered in the Weiyan-li area, seemingly preparing to attack us. Order each gun to fire at once." The first and second guns simultaneously hit an enemy vehicle with their first shots. The other guns also followed and fired at once. The enemy's trucks, like startled birds, hurried to speed forward. Our guns immediately changed the distance and continued to bombard, causing the enemy to flee backward again, and our shells closely pursued, resulting in the destruction of six enemy trucks and the killing and wounding of fifty or sixty enemies.
	During the operation, the enemy's reconnaissance planes constantly circled over our position, trying to find targets to indicate for the enemy's artillery to retaliate. But the enemy's reconnaissance was futile, because our artillery positions were camouflaged very cleverly, and there were also people specifically monitoring the enemy's aircraft movements. On this day, these witty heroes fired hundreds of shells at the enemy, stopping the enemy's advance.
	The next day, the enemy, thinking they had discovered our position, densely shelled it with howitzers, and enemy aircraft also concentrated their bombing, blasting the land. But at this time, our soldiers and their guns had already moved to new positions. The soldiers were preparing to meet new combat missions, and were determined not to let the enemy advance a single step.

　　不让敌人前进一步
     ——中国人民志愿军某炮兵部队的英勇阻击战纪实
    李玉珠
    五月二十五日，五次战役刚则结束，遭受了沉重打击的美国侵略者竟纠集了美军第三师、第二十四师以及加拿大“皇家步兵团”等部队，分三路向我冒险进犯，以掩盖其失败真象。但是敌人的计划完全被我志愿军所粉碎。敌人的所谓中路，在芝浦里一带，即被我志愿军某部的一个师阻击了六昼夜，未得前进一步，反而一退二十余里，而且付出了三千名官兵的生命、几十辆坦克和汽车、两架飞机以及成万发的榴弹炮炮弹和好几吨炸弹的代价。
    二十八日晚上，我炮兵部队某部的战士们，正在忙着整理套具和工具，突然接到命令：“进入阵地炮击敌人”。战士们听到了无不高兴万分，就只是怕时间来不及，于是大家加紧准备工作，立刻出发。不管敌机盘旋侦察，到处投照明弹、扫射、轰炸，战士们按时赶到了目的地，并迅速进入阵地，在拂晓前把一切伪装、工事和射击准备布置完成。大家怀着愉快的心情在等待时机，“让美国鬼子尝尝咱们炮弹的滋味。”
    第一炮位的战士，除了班长邵振加和班副李德元之外，都是新战士，没有作战的经验，信心不足，怕打起仗来不能很好的完成任务。“打起来能像平时操作一样熟练吗？”“我是否能拉好火呢？”“我能赶得上装填吗？”大家在行军的时候就一路思虑。班长邵振加同志看出这种情形，就动员大家说：“这是考验我们的时候，为祖国争光的时候，实现自己决心的时候了。”同时邵振加又把战场动作和应当注意事项，简单扼要地讲述一遍，使大家解除顾虑，更好地发挥战斗效能。
    天亮了。同志们吃过饭，轮班休息，以恢复一夜未瞌眼的疲劳。快到十点钟的时候，突然乌云密布，大雨倾盆。战士们都睡不下去了，只盼指挥所马上来命令，趁雨天向敌人开火。果然，到十点多，命令下来了：“全连向正前方的地方发射。”第一炮位不到三分钟便发射了好几十发炮弹。战士们在平时操练的时候，每分钟只能发射××发，现在达到了一分钟的发射速度提高一倍，打得敌人狼狈逃命。前面的步兵弟兄们高兴得拍掌叫好。一会儿，指挥所来电话说：“敌人的一营垮了，汽车都被打坏了。”
    到黄昏的时候，炮队奉令把阵地转移到另一处地方。战士们迅速地转移过去，赶紧修筑工事，准备第二天再战。每人都挖了单人壕，并加上盖，预备在没有战斗的时候可以在里面休息。吃晚饭的时候，大家愉快地畅谈白天的战斗。有的说：“出国两个多月，天天和敌机打麻烦，今天才算出了气。”立刻就有人表示不同意：“这就算出了气了？不，这才是开始哩！”
    班长召集大家开会，谈谈当天的战斗，表扬了在战斗中操作敏捷的战士，跟着就谈经验教训。他指出当天的掩蔽还不够好。一向不大爱说话的第三炮手曹文生说：“这不费难，不就是出点汗吗？”大家就立刻动起手来，加修工事，把伪装也弄得更完善。准备第二天再把敌人打个头破血流。
    一天两夜没有战斗，大家都盼望战斗的命令快些下来。第三天，还是十点多钟的时候，指挥所的电话来了：“前面有个地方有敌人十多辆汽车，一辆跟着一辆向我前沿阵地的小桥前进，并有大股敌人拥集在威岩里一带，有准备向我进攻的模样。命令各炮一齐发射。”第一、二两座炮第一炮就同时打中敌人的一辆汽车，其他各炮也跟着一齐发射，敌人的卡车如惊弓之鸟，赶忙加快向前奔驶。我们的各炮立刻改换距离，继续轰击，打得敌人又往后窜逃，而我们的炮弹紧追不放，结果打毁了敌人六辆卡车，打死打伤敌人五六十名。
    在作战的时候，敌人的侦察机不断在我方阵地上盘旋，企图找寻目标指示敌人的炮兵还击。但敌机的侦察是徒劳的，因为我们的炮兵阵地伪装得非常巧妙，并且还有专人监视敌机动向。在这一天中，我们这些机智的英雄们，就这样向敌人打了成百发炮弹，阻住了敌人的进犯。
    第二天，敌人自以为发现了我们的阵地，榴弹炮密集射来，敌机也集中投弹，炸得土地开花。而这时候，我们的战士和他们的炮，早已转移到新的阵地了。战士们又在准备着迎接新的战斗任务，并且决心不让敌人前进一步。
