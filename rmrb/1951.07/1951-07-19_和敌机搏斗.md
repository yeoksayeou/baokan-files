Korean Correspondence:

    The fighters of a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers near Tieyuan have persisted in fighting for four days and nights, but their hatred for the American air pirates makes them forget their fatigue. They stay on the position day and night, waiting for the opportunity to avenge the Korean people.

    Many times, enemy planes circled and bombed the valleys near the position, but they just didn't come to the anti-aircraft artillery position, which made the soldiers' eyes turn red with anger.

    On this very morning, unexpectedly, four jet enemy planes flew towards the position. The soldiers were immediately invigorated. Everyone was calculating: "Let's give them a head-on blow before they find the target!"

    The enemy planes were within the range of fire. "Boom, boom, boom..." A burst of head-on attack. In less than a minute, one enemy plane, with its wings askew and its tail trailing a plume of black smoke, fell into a nearby valley.

    Probably the position was discovered. The remaining three enemy planes circled far away and turned back again, and also brought four more. They spread out and launched a frantic, repeated attack on the area near the position. A fierce battle between the sky and the ground began.

  One Eye and One Hand Also Fight
    The enemy planes' machine gun bullets, bombs, and napalm bombs filled the ground with smoke and fire, and dust, but they could not scare the heroic anti-aircraft gunners. They calmly fired at the enemy planes in the sky.

    Comrade Ma Jingui's right eye was hit, and fresh blood gushed out from the wound, covering his right eye, making it impossible to open. He thought in his heart: "This is the end, my eyes are blind, how can I see the target!" But another thought immediately arose in his mind: "If the right eye is blind, there is still the left eye!" When the medic took advantage of the battle gap to bandage him, he instructed: "Just bandage the right eye, but don't cover the left eye, I will continue fighting soon!" He relied on one eye to persist in the battle to the end.

    An enemy plane swept a burst of machine gun fire towards the position, and three holes were pierced in Comrade Bai Yongwang's left palm by bullets. But he gritted his teeth, endured the pain, and used his right hand to pull the grip, continuing to fire.

    Comrades Wang Zhenguo, Zhu Zhenhua, Ni Zimei, Lou Kangyi, and others were burned on their faces and hands by napalm bombs, but they still insisted on not leaving the front line, fighting stubbornly with the enemy planes, and realizing their combat determination.

  Heroes Protecting Heroes
    When the battle was in full swing, an enemy plane dropped a napalm bomb, and the position caught fire. The rather small medic, Zhu Fusen, regardless of the danger, led the rescue team to the rescue. Just as they were about to put out the fire, the crazy enemy planes swept the position again. Zhou Zhenbao, the leader of the telephone squad who participated in the rescue, had his right leg bone broken and lay on the ground unable to move. Zhu Fusen immediately ran to him, wanting to carry him down for bandaging. But he was not strong enough to carry him, and there was no hidden place nearby, and he was afraid that the injured would lose too much blood if he was late. He decided to move him to a nearby single-person bunker and squatted outside, bending over to bandage him. He thought in his heart: "As long as the wounded person is not in pain, it doesn't matter about myself."

    The enemy planes' machine gun bullets hit around Zhu Fumu, dust rose, and broken stones bounced on him. This medic, who only knew "everything for the wounded," calmly used splints to bandage his injured comrade, and injected him with painkillers, and kept comforting him: "Comrade, don't worry, I guarantee there is no danger, we will definitely avenge you!" He turned around and encouraged the comrades in battle: "Come on, comrades, avenge the injured comrades!"

  Abundant Results
    When the enemy planes dived for the fourth time, several soldiers had been wounded on the position. The fire of revenge for the comrades burned in everyone's hearts. Several cannons, listening to the commander's command, focused on aiming at the lead plane that was about to dive. This fellow swayed a few times, and a plume of black smoke emerged, and it crashed towards the position. With a boom, a ball of fire rose in the field, and thick smoke soared into the sky.

    The soldiers fought more and more vigorously. The sky was full of clouds of smoke from the explosion of anti-aircraft artillery shells. Ten minutes later, another plane fell. Seeing the situation was not good, the other enemy planes dared not fly low. After circling a few times in the high altitude, they fled one after another.

    In half an hour of battle, they created a brilliant record of shooting down three enemy planes and wounding two.

　　和敌机搏斗
　　刘泽堂
    在铁原附近某阵地的中国人民志愿军某高射炮部队的战士们，已经坚持了四昼夜的战斗，但是对于美国空中强盗的痛恨使他们忘记了疲乏。他们日日夜夜守在阵地上，等待时机，为朝鲜人民复仇。
    多少次了，敌机在阵地附近的山沟上空盘旋轰炸，就是不到高射炮阵地这边来，气得战士们眼睛发红。
    就在这一个早晨，出乎意料的，四架喷气式的敌机向着阵地飞来。战士们精神为之一振。大家都在盘算：“不等它们发现目标就来一个猛打！”
    敌机到了火力圈内了。“轰，轰，轰……”一阵迎头痛击。还不到一分钟，就有一架敌机歪着翅膀，尾巴拖着一股黑烟，向着附近的一个山沟跌落下去了。
    大概是阵地被发现了，其余的三架敌机远远兜了一个圈子又拐回来，而且又另外带来了四架。它们摆开了阵势，就向着阵地附近一带进行疯狂的轮番袭击。天空和地面的激烈战斗开始了。
  一只眼睛一只手也要战斗
    敌机的机枪弹、炸弹、汽油弹，把地面打得烟火弥漫，尘土飞扬，但是却吓不倒英勇的高射炮手们。他们沉着地向着天空的敌机射击。
    马金贵同志的右眼角挂彩了，鲜血从伤口涌出来，把右眼蒙住，睁也睁不开。他心里想：“这一下可完了，眼睛瞎了，怎样看目标呀！”但是他心中立刻产生另外一个思想：“右眼瞎了还有左眼！”当卫生员趁战斗空隙给他裹伤时，他关照说：“把右眼包扎好就行，可别把左眼也蒙住，我马上还要继续战斗！”他就靠着一只眼坚持战斗到最后。
    敌机一梭子机关枪朝着阵地扫来，白永旺同志的左手掌被子弹打穿了三个窟窿。但是他咬紧牙关，忍着痛苦，用右手拉住握把，继续射击。
    王振国、朱振华、倪子美、娄康义等几位同志，脸上和手上被汽油弹烧伤了，还是坚持不下火线，顽强地与敌机搏斗，实现了自己的战斗决心。
  保护英雄的英雄
    战斗正激烈的时候，一架敌机投下一枚汽油弹，阵地着火了。个子挺小的卫生员朱富森，不顾危险，带领着救护组上前抢救。他们刚要把火扑灭，疯狂的敌机又向着阵地扫射。参加抢救的电话班班长周振保同志右腿骨被打断了，躺在地上不能动。朱富森立即跑到他的跟前，想把他背下去包扎。可是力气小，背不动，附近又没有隐蔽的地方，迟了又怕受伤者流血过多。他便决定把他移到附近一个单人掩体里，自己蹲在外面弯着身子替他包扎。他心里想：“只要伤员不受痛苦就行。自己没有关系。”
    敌机的机关枪弹打在朱富木的周围，尘土四起，被打碎的石块往他身上蹦。这位只知道“一切为了伤员”的卫生员同志，镇静地用夹板把受伤的战友包扎好，并给他注射了止痛剂，而且还不住口地安慰他说：“同志，放心吧，保证没有危险，我们一定给你报仇！”他又回过头去鼓励在战斗中的同志：“加油呀，同志们，给受伤的同志报仇呀！”
  丰饶的战果
    当敌机第四次俯冲扫射的时候，阵地上已经有好几个战士负伤了。大家的心中燃起了为战友们复仇的怒火。几门炮听着指挥员的指挥，集中瞄准那架正要俯冲下来的领航机进行射击。这家伙摇摆了几下，就冒出一股黑烟，向着阵地摔下来。轰的一声，田野上起了一团火光，浓烟冲天。
    战士们愈打愈起劲，满天是一朵一朵的高射炮炮弹炸裂的烟云，十分钟后又是一架掉下来了。其他几架敌机，见势不好，不敢低飞。在高空作了几个盘旋就一个跟着一个逃跑了。
    半小时的战斗，他们创造了打下三架、打伤两架敌机的辉煌战果。
