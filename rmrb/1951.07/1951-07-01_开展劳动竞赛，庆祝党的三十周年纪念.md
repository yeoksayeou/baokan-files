　　(I)
　　July 1st this year is the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, the great, glorious, and correct party of the Chinese working class. All Chinese workers are joyfully preparing to celebrate this great festival, and are enthusiastically launching labor emulation drives, striving to increase production to welcome this festival, as a gift to this great festival, as a gift to the Party and Chairman Mao. It is by no means accidental that Chinese workers and all the people celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Party with such sincerity and enthusiasm. As the staff and workers of the Tianjin Clothing Factory said in their letter to Chairman Mao in celebration of "July 1st": "All facts prove that only under the leadership of the Communist Party can the working class get rid of the life of beasts of burden and slaves in the past, gain true freedom, happiness, and glory, and give full play to their wisdom and ability to create a happy life for all the people and themselves. Recalling the past, looking at the present, and looking forward to the beautiful socialist and communist society in the future, we sincerely thank you and the Communist Party you lead. We will definitely make persistent efforts, launch labor emulation drives, and strive for resisting America, aiding Korea, building a great motherland, and finally realizing a communist society."
　　Labor emulation is the most valuable and meaningful gift that liberated workers give to the Party and to their leader, because it is the best expression of liberated workers "giving full play to their wisdom and ability to create a happy life for all the people and themselves," because it is the most basic method for liberated workers to "strive to build a great motherland and finally realize a communist society."

　　(II)
　　After liberation and victory, the working class got rid of the slave life of being subjected to the triple oppression of imperialism, feudal forces, and the bourgeoisie in the past, stood up from the abyss of poverty, hunger, and darkness, accepted the class education of Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought given by the Party, and understood that they had changed from the slave status of the past to the leading class of the country. Naturally, the idea of being the masters of the country arose, and a new attitude of being masters of labor was established. The main manifestation of this new labor attitude is labor emulation.
　　During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, the workers in the Liberated Areas, especially the ordnance workers, increased production by means of labor emulation to ensure the supply to the front lines, which made a lot of contributions to the victory of the War of Liberation. After the victory of the War of Liberation, the labor emulation movement gradually launched in factories and enterprises in major cities and industrial centers. The New Record Movement in Northeast China further improved the labor emulation movement. The city-wide competition in Tianjin for three months last year launched a large-scale labor emulation movement within the customs. The National Model Workers Congress held on the eve of National Day last year played a major role in promoting the labor emulation movement. Chairman Mao's call for "China must establish a strong national defense force and a strong economic force" gave the working class across the country great encouragement and a clear goal to struggle for. Therefore, after the National Model Workers Congress, the labor emulation movement has been more widely launched throughout the country. Especially when American imperialism invaded Taiwan and North Korea, the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses of workers rose to an unprecedented level. Workers in Northeast China took the lead in calling for a patriotic labor emulation movement, and workers everywhere shouted slogans such as "The factory is the battlefield, the machine is the gun, producing one more product is increasing the power to kill the enemy," "Reducing one defective product is equivalent to eliminating one enemy," and so on. Amazing production records continue to emerge. For example, in January this year, the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant set eight new steelmaking records in a row, the Tangshan Iron and Steel Plant set four new steel ingot production records in a row, the Huainan Coal Mine and the Fengfeng Coal Mine created new coal mining records one after another, and the workers of the Wuxi Huachang Silk Factory created the highest record of raw silk product quality in the country in the past fourteen years. Last year, railway workers across the country completed their annual production tasks 22 days ahead of schedule, and textile workers across the country overfulfilled the task of producing 20 yarns on a crash basis, which are the great achievements of workers in the entire industrial sector in launching labor emulation movements. At present, the labor emulation movement has been popularized in factories and enterprises throughout the country. According to incomplete statistics, more than 2,222,000 people across the country have participated in labor emulation, and 11,159 groups have participated in the Ma Hengchang team competition movement.
　　The most meaningful development in the labor emulation movement is that the masses of workers have not only greatly improved their labor enthusiasm, but also used their brains and developed their wisdom to solve various complex problems of how to improve production. The masses of workers have changed from slaves who were originally controlled by machines to real craftsmen who manage machines. Therefore, the technical improvement and rationalization proposal movement has gradually launched in the labor emulation movement. According to last year's statistics, 24,875 rationalization proposals were adopted across the country. The value saved by the railway system alone last year due to the adoption of rationalization proposals was 23.22 billion yuan. The significance of labor emulation and rationalization proposals is not only reflected in the huge value saved, but more importantly, it plays a major role in promoting the restoration and improvement of our industry.
　　Experience has proved that labor emulation and rationalization proposal movement are the main driving forces for transforming old enterprises. Through labor emulation, the labor enthusiasm of the masses of workers can be promoted, and the attitude of being masters can be improved and consolidated; it can promote the masses to learn technology and study technology, so that labor and technology are combined; it can promote technical personnel to change old technical views, so that technical personnel and workers can combine to improve production. Through labor emulation, work methods can be improved, and outdated work procedures can be changed; labor organization can be improved, and unreasonable phenomena such as having too many people doing too little work and hindering work and semi-manual division of labor methods can be eliminated. Through labor emulation, new technical standards and production quotas can be created, laying the foundation for implementing quota management and piece-rate wage system. Especially important is that through labor emulation, the weaknesses and irrationality of the old management system can be exposed, prompting enterprise leaders to review and improve the old management system, and even abolish those outdated management systems that hinder and bind the improvement of labor productivity, and establish new management systems that are suitable for the requirements of new labor productivity and can promote its development. Therefore, the labor emulation movement can be said to be a revolutionary movement, a communist movement of the broad masses of workers in our socialist enterprises. It wants to break through all the old things that bind labor productivity: old production quotas, old procedures, old systems, old organizations, and establish reasonable and progressive new production quotas, new procedures, new systems, and new organization. Labor emulation can not only transform the old system regulations, but also transform people, transform everyone involved in this movement, break their old and decadent concepts: individualistic selfish and self-interested concepts, concepts that despise workers, technical conservative concepts, and other kinds of conservative and backward concepts, accept new and progressive ideas, establish a new outlook on life, and become new people in the new society. The result is the establishment of a brand-new new democratic, that is, a socialist new enterprise.

　　(III)
　　The basic reason why the labor emulation movement has developed so vigorously is first of all the great victory of the people's revolution won by the working class under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, uniting the people of the whole country, after thirty years of arduous and great struggle. The broad masses of working people personally felt that the things that oppressed them in the past have been swept away, and they have truly become the masters of the country, the masters of society, and the masters who can control their own destiny. They know that the miserable fate of being cruelly oppressed and exploited and falling into poverty, hunger, and death has passed, and the prospect of a happy life has emerged, and the speed of increasing this happy life completely depends on their own labor creativity. Labor has changed from something that was despised not long ago to a glorious cause of creating a new society, creating a happy life for all the people and themselves. Therefore, a new attitude of being masters of labor has emerged, a vigorous labor emulation movement has emerged, and new figures such as labor models and labor heroes who stand at the forefront of this movement and lead this movement to continue to advance have emerged.
　　The second reason for promoting the vigorous development of the labor emulation movement is that the material and cultural lives of the broad masses of workers have been significantly improved with the restoration and development of the national economy. In terms of material life, first of all, due to the consolidation of the national finance, the malignant inflation that has caused great pain to the working people for more than ten years during the Kuomintang rule has been stopped. This one thing alone has greatly improved the lives of workers. Regarding the wages of workers, there have been universal increases in enterprises where production has been normal and is gradually developing and in areas where wages were originally too low. Taking the Northeast as an example, wages increased by 27% in 1949, 12.5% in 1950, and an average of about 15% this year. Regarding labor insurance, only the Northeast implemented it the year before last, and it was extended to industrial sectors such as railways and postal and telecommunications and regions such as Tianjin and Shijiazhuang last year. This year, the State Council formally promulgated the Labor Insurance Regulations, which will be initially implemented in factories and enterprises employing more than 100 workers across the country from May 1. According to existing statistics, approximately 2.3 million workers and staff members across the country have enjoyed labor insurance. If their families are included, 8 million to 10 million people have enjoyed labor insurance benefits. This is the revolutionary victory fruit that the Chinese working masses have dreamed of and fought for for decades. The implementation of labor insurance has provided certain material guarantees for the events that workers originally felt the most painful, such as birth, old age, illness, death, injury, and disability. The establishment of many nursing homes, disabled homes, sanatoriums, and spare-time rest homes has made workers feel great excitement and experience the vision of a happy life in the future. Regarding the issue of labor protection, due to the bad consequences caused by the past bureaucratic capital's view of valuing machines and despising people, the safety equipment of general industrial and mining enterprises was originally very poor. Since the Ministry of Labor promulgated the draft of the Factory Safety and Hygiene Regulations last year, with the joint efforts of all parties, especially the results of three major safety inspections in the Northeast last year, the safety and hygiene conditions of factories have been greatly improved. The number of work-related injuries and deaths this year has been greatly reduced compared with last year. For example, in coal mining enterprises, comparing the first quarter of this year with the first quarter of last year, work-related deaths have decreased by 83.1%, and work-related injuries have decreased by 59.7%, which is a good example. The problem of unemployment is a problem that workers in the original semi-colonial China felt particularly painful. Now, because the Central People's Government has allocated a large amount of funds to relieve unemployed workers (this is an unprecedented thing in Chinese history), the living difficulties of unemployed workers have been alleviated. Especially due to the restoration and development of national production, not only has the development of unemployment stopped, but also the unemployment phenomenon has been shrinking day by day. There is no doubt that after a considerable period of time, this plague - the phenomenon of unemployment, which is prevalent throughout the capitalist world, especially in colonial and semi-colonial countries and is most harmful, can be completely eliminated in New China.
　　In terms of cultural life, in the past under the reactionary rule, cultural life was almost exclusively owned by the ruling class, and the broad masses of workers were almost completely deprived of it. In modern industrial and mining enterprises, 50% to 80% of the workers are illiterate. This example alone can illustrate that workers are deprived of the right to enjoy cultural life. After the victory of the revolution, the situation has changed greatly. The enthusiasm of workers to learn culture and demand cultural life has risen to an unprecedented level. According to incomplete statistics, more than 1.3 million people in industrial and mining enterprises across the country are participating in amateur cultural learning, and in some industrial and mining enterprises, more than 80% of the employees are participating in amateur learning. Regarding cultural entertainment, labor cultural palaces have been established in major cities across the country, and there are more than 1,700 factory and enterprise clubs. The cultural undertakings founded by the National Railway Trade Union system alone include five large cultural palaces, six hundred and three clubs, four cultural trains, ten professional art troupes, seven hundred and twenty amateur drama troupes, five hundred and forty-seven libraries (or rooms), thirty film projection teams, one thousand and twenty-three sports teams (or groups), three hundred and forty-three Yangko waist drum teams, and two hundred and forty-four music groups. Other industrial systems have also made many achievements in organizing workers' cultural and entertainment undertakings. Now the lives of many workers' residential areas are completely different from the past. For example, the Shijingshan workers' residential area in Beijing, during the enemy puppet and Kuomintang rule, was a world where playing cards, gambling, and even prostitutes and drug offenders were rampant (these were all bad consequences created by the ruling class in the past, and this atmosphere was deliberately supported to corrupt the workers). Now it is a world where work, study, reading newspapers, meetings, and cultural activities such as sports, music, and singing are popular. Even the faces of people have changed. In the past, most of them were frowning or angry, but now they are full of joy and amiable. This is the new atmosphere of the new society. This is the great power of transforming enterprises, transforming society, and at the same time transforming workers themselves, as demonstrated by Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought after it is grasped by the masses of workers.
　　All of this is the fundamental reason for the vigorous development of the labor emulation. As Comrade Stalin said at the Soviet Stakhanov Workers Conference: "Life is getting better, life is getting happier. Since life is happy, work is more energetic. Therefore, there are high production records, and there are labor heroes and heroines." Therefore, the labor emulation movement can only appear in countries where workers have been liberated, workers have become the masters, and the lives of workers have been increasingly improved. Therefore, labor emulation is a beautiful flower blooming on the land of the victory of the Chinese revolution, a beautiful flower of the new democratic society, and a brilliant flower planted and cultivated by the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. It will bloom more and more beautifully year after year, and bear fruitful fruits. The accumulation of these fruits, the change of quantity into quality, will produce great results, which will be the industrialization of New China, which will be the realization of socialism and even communism.

　　(IV)
　　Past experience in labor emulation shows that the development process of labor emulation is a process from a crash effort to regularization, from strengthening labor intensity to combining labor with technology, and from combining with the improvement of the management system of industrial and mining enterprises. When industrial and mining enterprises have been taken over by the people's state, workers are no longer producing for exploiters, but producing for their own and the people's happiness, and preliminary democratic reforms have been carried out in industrial and mining enterprises, the old management system that binds workers has been broken, and the new labor attitude of workers has been initially established. At this time, it is possible and should launch and organize labor emulation to promote workers' labor enthusiasm and improve labor productivity (in private enterprises, labor emulation can also be organized after the capitalists change the old management methods based on oppression and coercion). This initial labor emulation movement will inevitably be a crash effort and will be mainly based on intensive labor intensity. Because once the masses of workers have the initial idea of being masters of the country and realize that they should not adopt a grinding attitude to work in people's enterprises, they will naturally try their best to work hard with intensive labor intensity. This is the initial concrete manifestation of the new attitude of being masters of labor. At this time, the leadership should certainly recognize that this intensive labor intensity cannot last and will be harmful to the health of workers, and as a result, it will be harmful to production. However, they should not take measures to pour cold water, and should not just passively and unilaterally oppose the crash nature of labor emulation, but should be good at taking various positive steps to guide labor emulation to gradually develop from a temporary crash to regularization. The specific methods are:
　　First, promote the rationalization proposal movement, inspire workers to use their brains and develop their wisdom, find out the shortcomings in work methods, labor organization, technical procedures, and machine equipment, raw material supply, etc., that waste labor and waste raw materials and resources, propose improvement methods, and gradually promote those that have been tested and are indeed valuable. Prevent excessive overtime and fatigue from exhausting workers' physical strength.
　　Second, promote the combination of labor and technology, encourage workers to learn technology and improve their skills; encourage workers to combine with technical personnel to jointly study and improve tools and technology methods, and prevent rash and reckless actions without testing, resulting in damage to tools and machines.
　　Third, when organizing competitions, it is necessary to put forward clear competition goals, combine them with the completion of the production plan of the enterprise, and combine them with solving the current weakest or most critical link in production, avoiding generality and blindness.
　　Fourth, various new systems should be gradually established in the labor emulation movement, first of all the responsibility system, inspection system, and quality specifications, to prevent the bias of simply pursuing quantity and ignoring quality.
　　Fifth, in the competition movement, it is necessary to promote the spirit of class mutual assistance, establish patriotic covenants for the team, break the backward guild-like technical conservative views among workers, mobilize skilled workers to enthusiastically impart technology to other workers with relatively backward technology, and promote the experience of advanced producers and advanced production teams, so that the advanced can drive the backward to move forward together. Promote collective heroism and prevent individual championshipism.
　　Sixth, in the competition, gradually improve the operation and management of enterprises, create new technical standards and quotas, and lay a preliminary foundation for implementing economic accounting system. Promote the signing of linked contracts and collective contracts, so that the various production departments and between the operation and management departments and the production departments seek mutually coordinated balanced development.
　　Seventh, pay attention to cultivating labor models so that they truly become models among the masses, and truly play the role of leaders, backbones, and bridges as Chairman Mao instructed. Correct and prevent the situation where some labor models now hinder their production work and gradually lose their model role due to multiple part-time jobs, multiple meetings, multiple tasks, and multiple interviews.
　　Eighth, in the development of the labor emulation movement, gradually establish a reasonable reward system. Rewards are the material conditions for consolidating labor emulation. At the beginning, the scope of rewards can be relatively broad, and those who overfulfill the task should be given different rewards. When an enterprise has a relatively sound quota management system and implements a piece-rate wage system or a time-based bonus system, the rewards should be given to a few outstanding people who have made the greatest contribution to improving labor productivity or improving production, because most people have already received rewards from piece-rate wages or time-based bonus wages when they complete and exceed their production plans.
　　Ninth, what is particularly important is to always pay attention to stepping up class education for the broad masses of workers. Call on and organize workers to study hard: study politics, study current affairs, study the glorious struggle history of the Chinese Communist Party, study the spirit of hard work, heroic sacrifice, and wholehearted service to the people of the workers' class martyrs, study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and continuously improve class awareness, improve the sense of responsibility of being masters, and promote the high degree of fighting spirit to resolutely fight for the class, for the people, for our great motherland, and for the socialist future. Only on the basis of such continuous learning and continuous improvement of class awareness, the labor emulation movement will become more and more developed, more and more in-depth, and over time, it will become the regular labor mode and lifestyle of the broad masses of workers. This is the most important guarantee for building our great motherland and striving for a socialist future. Every worker, every employee, every laborer, should always remember what Chairman Mao said at the Shanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Labor Model Conference: "China depends on us to build, we must study hard."
　　The Chinese working class will always unite under the banner of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, carry forward the traditional spirit of heroic struggle, and fight to the end for building a prosperous and happy new China and for striving for a socialist and communist future.

　　开展劳动竞赛，庆祝党的三十周年纪念
    李立三
            （一）
    今年七月一日是中国工人阶级自己的政党，伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党的建党三十周年纪念日。全中国工人都在欢欣鼓舞地准备庆祝这个伟大的节日，都在热烈地开展劳动竞赛，努力提高生产，来迎接这个节日，作为对这个伟大节日的献礼，作为向党、向毛主席的献礼。中国工人和全体人民这样真诚热烈地来庆祝党的三十周年纪念，完全不是偶然的。正如天津被服厂全体职工为庆祝“七一”写给毛主席的信中所说：“一切事实证明，只有在共产党领导下，工人阶级才摆脱了过去牛马奴隶的生活，才获得真正的自由、幸福和光荣，才能发挥自己的智慧能力来创造全体人民和自己的幸福生活。回忆过去，看看现在，瞻望将来美满的社会主义、共产主义社会，我们衷心感谢您和您所领导的共产党。我们一定再接再厉，展开劳动竞赛，为抗美援朝、建设伟大的祖国和最后实现共产主义社会而奋斗”。
    劳动竞赛，是解放了的工人献给党、献给自己领袖的最可宝贵和最有意义的礼物，因为它是解放了的工人“发挥自己智慧能力来创造全体人民和自己幸福生活”的最好表现，因为它是解放了的工人“为建设伟大祖国和最后实现共产主义社会而奋斗”的最基本的方法。
            （二）
    工人阶级在解放胜利以后，摆脱了过去遭受帝国主义、封建势力和资产阶级三重压迫的奴隶生活，从贫穷、饥饿、黑暗的深渊中站立起来，接受了党所给予的马克思、列宁主义——毛泽东思想的阶级教育，了解了自己已从过去的奴隶地位变成了国家的领导阶级，就自然要发生国家主人翁的思想，树立起新的主人翁的劳动态度。这种新的劳动态度的主要表现就是劳动竞赛。
    还在抗日战争和解放战争时期，解放区的工人，首先是兵工工人，就曾以劳动竞赛的方法来增加生产，保证前线的供给，对解放战争的胜利有不少的贡献。在解放战争胜利以后，劳动竞赛运动就逐渐在各大城市和工业中心的工厂企业中开展起来。东北的新纪录运动，把劳动竞赛运动，更提高了一步，天津去年三个月的全市竞赛，展开了关内大规模的劳动竞赛运动。去年国庆节前夜举行的全国劳动模范代表大会，对劳动竞赛运动更起了重大的推动作用。毛主席提出的“中国必须建立强大的国防军，必须建立强大的经济力量”的号召，给了全国工人阶级极大的鼓舞和明确的奋斗目标，所以在全国劳动模范代表大会以后，劳动竞赛运动就在全国各地更广泛地开展起来了。特别在美帝国主义侵略台湾朝鲜，全国人民奋起举行抗美援朝的时候，工人群众的爱国热情，空前高涨。东北工人首先号召举行爱国主义的劳动竞赛运动，各地工人都一致喊出“工厂就是战场，机器就是枪炮，多出一件产品，就是增加一分杀敌的力量”，“减少一件废品就等于消灭一个敌人”等等口号。惊人的生产纪录不断的涌现出来，如今年一月太原钢铁厂连创八次熔钢新纪录，唐山钢铁厂连创四次钢锭产量新纪录，淮南煤矿与峰峰煤矿接二连三创造采煤新纪录，无锡华昌丝厂工人创造了十四年来全国生丝产品质量的最高纪录。去年全国铁路职工提前二十二天完成了全年生产任务，全国纺织工人超额完成了突击二十支纱的任务，更是整个产业部门的工人开展劳动竞赛运动所获得的巨大成果。现在劳动竞赛运动已普及到全国各地的工厂企业中，据不完全的统计，全国参加劳动竞赛的有二百二十二万二千余人，参加马恒昌小组竞赛运动的有一万一千一百五十九个小组。
    在劳动竞赛运动中，最有意义的发展，就是工人群众不仅大大提高了劳动积极性，而且开动了脑筋，发扬了自己的智慧，来解决如何改进生产的各种复杂问题。工人群众已从原来被机器管制的奴隶，变成了真正管理机器的匠师。因此技术改进与合理化建议运动就在劳动竞赛运动中逐渐开展起来。根据去年的统计，全国各地共采用了二万四千八百七十五件合理化建议。单只铁路系统去年一年由于采用合理化建议所节约的价值，就有二百三十二亿二千万元人民币。劳动竞赛与合理化建议的意义，不只表现在节约的巨大价值上，更重要的是对我们工业的恢复和改进起着重大的推动作用。
    经验证明，劳动竞赛与合理化建议运动是改造旧企业的主要动力。通过劳动竞赛，可以发扬工人群众的劳动热情，提高与巩固主人翁的劳动态度；可以推动群众学习技术、钻研技术，使劳动与技术结合；可以推动技术人员，改变旧的技术观点，使技术人员与工人结合起来改进生产。通过劳动竞赛，可以改进工作方法，改变陈旧的工作规程；可以改善劳动组织，消除人多活少，妨碍工作及半手工业式的分工方法等不合理现象。通过劳动竞赛、可以创造新的技术标准与生产定额，打下实行定额管理和实行计件工资制的基础。尤其重要的是，通过劳动竞赛，可以暴露旧的经营管理制度的弱点和不合理性，促起企业领导者要对旧的经营管理制度加以审查和改进，以至废除那些障碍和束缚劳动生产率提高的陈旧了的经营管理制度，建立起适合新的劳动生产率的要求并能推动它向前发展的新的经营管理制度。所以劳动竞赛运动可以说是我们社会主义性质的工厂企业中广大劳动群众的一种革命运动，一种共产主义的运动。它要冲破一切束缚劳动生产力的旧东西：旧的生产定额，旧的规程，旧的制度，旧的组织，建立起合理的进步的新的生产定额，新的规程，新的制度，新的组织机构。劳动竞赛不只是可以改造旧的制度规章，而且可以改造人、改造参加这个运动所波及的一切人，打破他们的旧的腐朽的观念：个人主义的自私自利观念，轻视工人的观念，技术保守观念，以及其他种种守旧落后的观念，接受新的进步的思想，树立起新的人生观，变成新社会的新人物。其结果就是建立起焕然一新的新民主主义的、也就是社会主义的新企业。
            （三）
    劳动竞赛运动其所以这样蓬勃发展的基本原因，首先是工人阶级在党和毛主席的领导下，团结全国人民，经过三十年艰苦伟大的斗争所获得的伟大的人民革命胜利。广大劳动群众亲身感觉到了，过去压迫他们的东西，已经一扫而光，他们真正成了国家的主人，社会的主人，能掌握自己命运的主人。他们知道，遭受残酷压迫剥削而陷于贫困、饥饿、死亡的悲惨命运已经过去，幸福生活的前途已经出现了，而且这种幸福生活增进的速度，完全决定于自己的劳动创造力。劳动已经从不久前还被人贱视的东西，变成了创造新社会，创造全体人民和自己幸福生活的光荣事业。因此就出现了新的主人翁的劳动态度，出现了蓬蓬勃勃的劳动竞赛运动，出现了站在这个运动前列，带领这个运动不断前进的劳动模范、劳动英雄这样的新人物。
    推动劳动竞赛运动蓬勃发展的第二个原因，就是广大工人群众的物质文化生活，已经随着国家经济的恢复和发展，有了显著的改善。在物质生活方面，首先由于国家财政的巩固，停止了国民党统治时代十几年来使劳动人民感受莫大痛苦的恶性通货膨胀，单只这一件事，就使工人生活有了很大的改善。关于工人的工资，在生产已经正常，并且已在逐渐发展的企业及原来工资过低的地区，都有了普遍的增加。以东北为例，在一九四九年增加了工资百分之二十七，一九五○年增加了百分之十二点五，今年又平均增加了百分之十五左右。关于劳动保险，前年只有东北实行，去年推广到铁路、邮电等产业部门和天津、石家庄等地区，今年已由政务院正式颁布劳动保险条例，从五月一日起，初步推行于全国雇用一百工人以上的工厂企业，据现有统计，全国已有二百三十万左右的工人职员享受了劳动保险，若连他们的家属计算，就有八百万到一千万人享受了劳动保险待遇。这是中国工人群众梦想了、斗争了几十年才获得的革命胜利果实。劳动保险的实施，使工人原来最感痛苦的生、老、病、死、伤、残等事件都获得了一定的物质保障。许多养老院、残废院、疗养所、业余休养所的建立，使工人感到了莫大的兴奋，体验到将来幸福生活的远景。关于劳动保护问题，由于过去官僚资本重视机器贱视人的观点所造成的恶果，一般工矿企业的安全设备原来都是非常恶劣的。自去年劳动部颁布工厂安全卫生条例草案，经过各方面的共同努力，特别是东北去年进行三次安全大检查的结果，工厂安全卫生条件已有不少的改善。今年的因工伤亡事件已比去年大大减少，如煤矿企业，今年第一季与去年第一季比较，因工死亡减少了百分之八十三点一，因工负伤减少了百分之五十九点七，便是很好的例证。关于失业问题是原来半殖民地的中国工人特别感受痛苦的问题。现在由于中央人民政府拨出大批款项救济失业工人（这是中国历史上空前未有的事情），减轻了失业工人的生活困难，特别是由于国家生产事业的恢复和发展，不仅停止了失业现象的发展，而且使失业现象日益缩小了。毫无疑问经过一个相当的时期，就可以把这个流行于整个资本主义世界，特别是在殖民地半殖民地国家为害最深的瘟疫病——失业现象，在新中国完全消灭。
    关于文化生活方面，过去在反动统治下，文化生活几乎为统治阶级所专有，广大工人群众几乎是完全被剥夺了的。在现代工矿企业中有百分之五十到八十的工人是不识字的。单是这个例子，就可以说明，工人是被剥夺了享受文化生活权利的。在革命胜利后，情形就大大的不同了。工人要求学习文化，要求文化生活的热情空前高涨。现在据不完全的统计，全国工矿企业中参加业余文化学习的有一百三十多万人，有些工矿企业，有百分之八十以上的职工参加业余学习。关于文化娱乐方面，在全国各大城市都建立了劳动文化宫，有一千七百多个工厂企业的俱乐部。单是全国铁路工会一个系统所创办的文化事业，就有五个大的文化宫，六○三个俱乐部、四个文化列车，十个专业文工团，七二○个业余剧团，五四七个图书馆（或室），三十个电影放映队，一○二三个体育队（或组），三四三个秧歌腰鼓队，二四四个音乐组。其他产业系统在组织工人文化娱乐事业方面也是有不少成绩的。现在许多工人住宅区的生活与过去比较起来，简直完全是另外一种世界了。例如北京石景山工人住宅区，在敌伪和国民党统治时代，是打牌、赌博以至暗娼、毒犯等盛行的世界（这些都是过去统治阶级制造出来的恶果，并且是有意扶植这种风气来腐化工人的）。现在是工作、学习、读报、开会、以及体育、音乐、歌唱等文化活动盛行的世界。连人的面孔都变了，过去多半是愁眉苦脸或怒气勃勃，现在是喜溢眉宇、和蔼可亲。这就是新社会的新气象，这就是马列主义——毛泽东思想为工人群众所掌握以后所表现出来的，改造企业、改造社会，并且同时改造工人自己的伟大力量。
    所有这一切，就是劳动竞赛蓬勃发展的根本原因。正如斯大林同志在苏联斯达汉诺夫工作者会议上所说的话：“生活好些了，生活快乐些了。生活既然快乐，工作也就来得有劲。于是就有高度的生产纪录出现，就有男女劳动英雄出现”。所以劳动竞赛运动只有在工人已经解放，工人已经当了主人，工人的生活已经日益提高和改善的国家才能出现。所以劳动竞赛是中国革命胜利的地土上开出来的鲜丽之花，是新民主主义社会的鲜丽之花，是中国共产党和毛主席亲手种植培养出来的光辉灿烂的花。它将要年复一年地开得愈加纷繁鲜丽，并结出累累的果实。这些果实的积累，数量变成质量，就会产生伟大的结果，这就会是新中国的工业化，这就会是社会主义以至共产主义的实现。
            （四）
    过去劳动竞赛的经验表明，劳动竞赛的发展过程，是从突击到经常化，是由加强劳动强度、到劳动与技术相结合，是与工矿企业经营管理制度的改进相结合的发展过程。当工矿企业已经收归人民的国家所有以后，工人已经不是再为剥削者生产，而是为自己和人民的幸福而生产，又在工矿企业中进行了初步的民主改革工作，束缚工人的旧的管理制度已被打破，工人的新的劳动态度也已初步树立起来了，这时就可以而且应当发动和组织劳动竞赛，以发扬工人的劳动热情，提高劳动生产率（在私营企业中，当资方改变了以压迫强制为基础的旧的管理方法后，也可以组织劳动竞赛）。这种初期的劳动竞赛运动不可避免地会是突击性的，会是以紧张劳动强度为主的。因为工人群众一旦有了初步的主人翁思想，认识了在人民企业中不应当采取磨洋工的劳动态度来工作的时候，自然就会尽可能地用紧张的劳动强度，努力工作。这就是新的主人翁的劳动态度的初步具体表现。这时领导方面，固然要认清这种紧张的劳动强度是不能持久，是会有害于工人身体健康，并且结果会有害于生产，但是不应当采取泼冷水的办法，不应当只是消极的片面的反对劳动竞赛的突击性，而要善于采取各种积极的步骤引导劳动竞赛逐渐从一时的突击向经常化发展。其具体办法是：
    第一，提倡合理化建议运动，启发工人开动脑筋发扬智慧，找出在工作方法、劳动组织、技术规程及机器设备、原料供给等等方面，浪费劳动力，浪费原料资财的缺点，提出改进的办法，并选择其中经过试验，确有价值者逐渐推行。防止过多的加班加点，疲劳工人体力的办法。
    第二，提倡劳动与技术结合，鼓励工人学习技术，提高熟练程度；鼓励工人与技术人员结合，共同研究，改善工具、改进技术的方法，防止不经试验，冒昧蛮干，以致破坏工具和机器的事件。
    第三，在组织竞赛时，要提出明确的竞赛目标，与完成本工矿企业的生产计划相结合，与解决生产当前最薄弱的或最关键的一环相结合，避免一般性与盲目性。
    第四，要在劳动竞赛运动中逐渐建立各种新的制度，首先是负责制、检验制和质量规格，以防止单纯追逐数量，忽视质量的偏向。
    第五，要在竞赛运动中提倡阶级互助精神，订立小组爱国公约，打破工人中落后的行会性的技术保守观点，发动技术工人热情地传授技术给其他技术比较落后的工人，推广先进生产者与先进生产小组的经验，使先进的带动落后的，一块前进。发扬集体英雄主义，防止个人锦标主义。
    第六，要在竞赛中逐渐改善企业的经营管理，创造新的技术标准与定额，为实行经济核算制打下初步的基础。提倡订立联系合同与集体合同，使各生产部门之间及经营管理部门与生产部门之间，求得相互配合的平衡发展。
    第七，要注意培养劳动模范，使他们真正成为群众中的模范，真正像毛主席所指示的一样，能起带头作用，骨干作用和桥梁作用。纠正和防止像现在某些劳动模范因兼职多、会议多、任务多、谈话访问多而妨碍他们的生产工作，逐渐丧失模范作用的情形。
    第八，要在劳动竞赛运动发展中，逐渐建立合理的奖励制度。奖励是巩固劳动竞赛的物质条件。在开始时，奖励的范围可以比较广，对超额完成任务者给以多少不同的奖励。到了某一工矿企业已具备了比较健全的定额管理制度和实行了计件工资制或计时奖励制时，奖励应当给与对提高劳动生产率或对生产改进最有贡献的少数杰出的人，因为大多数人已经在完成和超过其生产计划时从计件工资或计时奖励工资中得到了奖励了。
    第九，特别重要的，是要经常注意加紧对广大工人群众的阶级教育。号召和组织工人努力学习：学习政治，学习时事，学习中国共产党的光荣斗争历史，学习工人阶级的先烈们艰苦奋斗、英勇牺牲、全心全意为人民服务的精神，学习马克思、列宁主义与毛泽东思想，不断地提高阶级觉悟，提高主人翁的责任感，发扬为阶级、为人民、为我们伟大祖国、为争取社会主义前途而坚决奋斗的高度的战斗精神。只有在这样不断学习，不断提高阶级觉悟的基础上，劳动竞赛运动，才会愈加开展、愈加深入，久而久之，就会成为广大劳动群众的经常劳动方式和生活方式。这就是建设我们伟大祖国，争取社会主义前途最重要的保证。每一个工人职员，每一个劳动者，都应当永远记着毛主席在陕甘宁边区劳模大会上说的话：“中国靠我们来建设，我们必须努力学习。”
    中国工人阶级将永远团结在中国共产党和毛主席的旗帜下，发扬英勇斗争的传统精神，为建设富强幸福的新中国，为争取社会主义和共产主义的将来而奋斗到底。
