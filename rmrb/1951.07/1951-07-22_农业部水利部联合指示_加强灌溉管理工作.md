Joint Directive from the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Water Resources: Strengthening Irrigation Management

　　The Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government recently issued a joint directive on strengthening irrigation management. The main points of the directive are as follows:

　　(1) Leading organs for water conservancy at all levels must establish irrigation management departments or appoint full-time cadres. Those that have already been established should be strengthened according to actual needs, and the masses benefiting from each canal should be organized to assist the management organization in implementing democratic management. In terms of working methods, water conservancy organs at all levels may, in light of actual conditions, try to concentrate their efforts on strengthening the management of a certain canal system, deeply study rational and effective working methods, and draw experience from them to promote overall work.

　　(2) All irrigation management organs must formulate engineering maintenance methods and canal protection covenants (including reward and punishment measures) to ensure that the canals can supply water regularly. Diversion control and water measurement equipment should be installed at the head of the canals to ensure that the canals always have sufficient water and to control the amount of water flowing into the canals. Flood discharge and water release equipment should be added to the canals as needed to prevent the canals from being washed away or collapsed. During the flood season, all management organs should also adequately prepare flood fighting tools and materials, and form mass defenses.

　　(3) Regarding the water use procedures and water allocation during irrigation, each canal management agency should formulate fair and reasonable irrigation methods based on the irrigation area and crop types of each branch canal and distribution canal, and then convene representatives of the beneficiary masses to discuss, revise, and implement them to reduce water use disputes and maximize the effectiveness of irrigation.

　　(4) All irrigation management organs should investigate irrigation areas, implement land registration, formulate fair and reasonable water fee collection methods, and strictly implement the water fee revenue and expenditure budget and final account system.

　　(5) In order to maintain soil fertility, prevent alkalization, and increase agricultural production, all irrigation leadership organs should strive to study various irrigation methods for soils and crops. If conditions permit, irrigation experiment stations may be established in conjunction with agricultural technology agencies or agricultural schools to conduct joint research.

　　农业部水利部联合指示
　  加强灌溉管理工作
    中央人民政府农业部及水利部于日前发布关于加强灌溉管理工作的联合指示。指示要点如下：
    （一）各级水利事业领导机关，必须建立灌溉管理部门或专职干部，已建立者应根据实际需要予以充实，并组织各渠道的受益群众协助管理机构实行民主管理。在工作方法上，各级水利机关可参酌实际情况，试行集中力量，加强对某一渠道系统的管理，深入研究合理有效的工作方法，从中吸取经验，以推动全面工作。
    （二）各灌溉事业管理机关，必须订出工程养护办法及护渠公约（包括奖惩办法），以保证渠道能经常供水。在渠首处应设导流管制和量水设备，以保证渠道能经常有充足的用水和控制流入渠道的水量。渠道上则应视需要增建排洪及泄水设备，以免渠道被冲毁或坍塌。在汛期内，各管理机关更应适当地准备抢险工具和材料，并组成群众防守。
    （三）对于灌溉时的用水程序和水量分配，各渠道管理机构应根据各支渠和斗渠的灌溉面积和农作物类别，拟定公平合理的灌溉办法，然后再约集受益群众代表商讨修订后实行，以减除用水纠纷，发挥灌溉的最大效能。
    （四）各灌溉事业管理机关应清查灌溉面积，实行地亩登记，制订公平合理的水费征收办法，并严格执行水费收支预决算制度。
    （五）各灌溉事业领导机关为保持土壤肥沃，防止碱化及增加农田的生产量，应努力研究各种土壤及作物的灌溉方法。如条件许可，可结合农业技术机关或农业学校等筹设灌溉实验站，共同进行。
