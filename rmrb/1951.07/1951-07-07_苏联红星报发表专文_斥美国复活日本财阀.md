Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 6th: The Red Star newspaper of the Soviet Union published an article on the 4th by Inkov, Master of Economics, entitled "The Revival of Japanese Zaibatsu." The article states that since the beginning of the occupation of Japan, the American authorities have violated the provisions of the Potsdam Proclamation and embarked on the road of reviving Japanese militarism and restoring Japan's war industry. Japanese monopoly capitalists (Zaibatsu) have become the pillar of American imperialists and the most fanatical advocates of Japan's rearmament. At present, the largest Japanese monopoly capitalists, headed by war criminals, still occupy important positions in Japan's major economic sectors. Last year, they controlled 70 percent of metallurgical industry production, 48 percent of coal production, textiles, food industry, shipbuilding, and most enterprises in other economic sectors of Japan. At the same time, American monopoly capitalists unscrupulously seize important positions in Japanese industry, acquire shares that can control Japanese enterprises, and invest funds in Japanese industry without hindrance. American imperialists are not only turning Japan into their war base, but also turning Japan into their colony.

Inkov further stated: After the United States began its aggression against Korea, the entire productive capacity of Japanese enterprises was used to produce "special demand" orders for the American intervention troops. The collusion between the American ruling clique and the Japanese militarists accelerated the growth of Japanese war production.

Inkov wrote: While restoring the Japanese Zaibatsu, American imperialists are also trying to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan, hoping to consolidate the alliance between American and Japanese monopoly enterprises in this way, and to legalize the act of turning Japan into an arsenal and a base of aggression.

    斥美国复活日本财阀
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：《红星报》四日刊载经济学硕士英柯夫的一篇论文，题为《日本财阀的复活》。论文称：从开始占领日本起，美国当局就违背波茨坦公告的规定，走上了复活日本军国主义及恢复日本战争工业的道路。日本垄断资本家（财阀）成为美国帝国主义者的支柱，并且是日本重新武装的最狂热的鼓吹者。现在，以战争罪犯为首的最大的日本垄断资本家，仍在日本各主要经济部门中占着重要地位。去年，他们控制了冶金工业生产的百分之七十，煤炭生产的百分之四十八，纺织业、粮食业、造船业以及日本其他经济部门中的大多数企业。同时，美国垄断资本家毫无顾忌地夺取日本工业中的重要地位，收购可以控制日本各企业的股份，毫无阻碍地把资金投于日本工业。美帝国主义者不仅正在把日本变成他们的战争基地，并且正在把日本变成他们的殖民地。
    英柯夫进一步说：在美国开始侵略朝鲜后，日本各企业的全部生产力都被用来生产美国干涉军的“特需”订货。美国统治集团与日本军国主义者之间的勾结，加速了日本战争生产的增长。
    英柯夫写道：美帝国主义者一方面恢复日本财阀，同时又力图缔结单独对日和约，他们希望这样来巩固美国和日本垄断企业之间的联盟，把变日本为兵工厂和侵略基地的行为合法化。
