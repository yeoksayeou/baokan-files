　　Study, Study, and Study Again
    Professor Jin Kemu, Peking University
    As we celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the great Chinese Communist Party, in addition to joyfully praising and shouting "Long Live" to welcome this great day, we should also intensify our work, intensify our study, and be determined to follow the Communist Party forever.
    Study the Party's theory, study the Party's history, and study the Party's style. We have been shouting the slogan of study since liberation. However, I feel that studying is really not an easy task, and the more you study, the more difficult it becomes, "Only through learning do you realize your inadequacy." This is because what we need to learn is not just a batch of ready-made books and a set of self-contained theories, but practice.
    During the initial period of study, I learned some theories, but I always felt that it was just learning another set of things, ultimately incompatible, and superficial. Faced with the facts, there arose a feeling of "each has his own reasons" making it difficult to distinguish right from wrong. In this way, the issue of stance was gradually forced out. After determining the stance, it became easier to judge right from wrong. So, one began to check one's stance in every word and deed.
    But this was not enough. One had to be trapped for another period, bumping into many incomprehensible obstacles, to take another step forward, and a class standpoint issue was forced out in one's heart. Thus, classifying classes, one suddenly saw many problems more clearly.
    But it still wouldn't work. One could diagnose the problem but not prescribe a cure. One could only draw a mask, but not solve the problem. This proves that the theory learned was not a guide to action. This hurdle was not easy to overcome. Marxism-Leninism is different from other theories precisely because of this point. Fortunately, we had the closest, most intimate mentor who spoke in Chinese people's maxims, Mao Zedong Thought, and we had the People's Daily guiding us every day. In addition, the people had already turned themselves over and launched a vigorous Three-Anti and Five-Anti Campaigns. Thus, I opened my eyes from the practice of accepting the Party's education and saw that all problems were problems of class struggle. After studying for a year or two, I finally turned back, realizing that everything was concentrated in the first sentence of the "Communist Manifesto." All of human activity is class struggle, and to have struggle, there must be organization and the leadership of the Party; otherwise, it will still be suspended in the air, seemingly detached but actually falling to the east and tilting to the west without realizing it.
    Consciously participating in the class struggle, in China today, means consciously following the Chinese Communist Party in carrying out revolutionary struggle. In such a struggle, even though what is thrown is not a hand grenade but just a stone, one truly understands the revolution. In the past, reading books on Marxism-Leninism was like ordinary people reading Buddhist scriptures—knowing every word and understanding every sentence, but there was a layer between them, not knowing what was being said. Studying Marxism-Leninism in this way was like almost understanding but not quite, scratching an itch from outside one's boot. This is because one did not shout loudly and throw a stone along with the People's Liberation Army.
    In this way, it seemed that one had reached the end of one's studies. But not so, this was just the beginning. Once this stone was thrown, Mao Zedong Thought immediately became alive for me. It taught us how to continue throwing it until complete victory. Action requires learning theory, and learning theory must be done through action. Learning to fight must involve carrying a gun and taking steps, and not just sitting in a room reciting the infantry drill manual. For an owl accustomed to crouching in a dark hole, flying in the sunlight is painful. Similarly, for those who are accustomed to treating reading as the only form of learning, I dare say that learning to fight is extremely difficult. For intellectuals, learning class struggle is more difficult than reading ten thousand books, more difficult than mastering any language, and more difficult than knowing everything about the past and present. Only then did I understand why the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course" is the foundation of Marxism-Leninism, and why a Marxist scholar who is familiar with "Das Kapital" cannot be considered a Marxist. Learning military affairs is learning to fight wars, learning to fight wars is learning about the army, and learning Mao Zedong Thought is learning about the Party. Without the Party, everything is empty talk.
    "Go deep into the masses and do not indulge in empty talk." This is Chairman Mao's instruction.
    Having revolved with my eyes closed for a long time, thinking that I had traveled a lot of ground, today, on the Party's thirtieth birthday, I realize that I can say to the Party: "It turns out that you have been teaching me for so many years, and I still haven't moved!" Well, even if I stumble as soon as I take a step, I will get up again after falling and walk forward. From now on, I will follow you on the Long March!
    I will take this short article as my insignificant gift to the Party's great birthday.
    Long live the great Communist Party, long live the great Chairman Mao!

　　学习学习再学习
    北京大学教授  金克木
    当伟大的中国共产党三十周年纪念的时候，我们除了欢喜赞叹高呼万岁来迎接这个伟大日子以外，还应该加紧工作，加紧学习，下决心永远跟着共产党走。
    学习党的理论，学习党的历史，学习党的作风。从解放起我们就喊出学习的口号了。不过，我觉得，学习实在不是一件容易的事，而且越学越难，“学然后知不足”。这就是因为我们所要学的不是仅仅一批现成的书本和一套自成体系的理论，而是实践。
    在开始的一段学习期间，我学了一些理论，但总觉得不过是多学了一套东西，究竟格格不入，浮光掠影。面对事实，就出现了“公说公有理婆说婆有理”的是非难辨的感觉。这样，渐渐就逼出了立场问题。先确定了立场，是非就容易判明了。于是开口闭口处处不忘查立场。
    但是这还不够得很，还得再困一个时期，碰许多想不通的钉子，才更进一步，心里逼出了一个阶级立场问题。于是划分阶级，由此恍然又看清了许多问题。
    可是还是不行。能开脉案不能开药方，光会画脸谱，还不能解决问题。这证明所学到的理论还不是行动的指南。这一关可不容易过了。马克思列宁主义非其他理论之比就凭这一点。幸亏有了离我们最近的，最亲切的，讲中国人民格言的导师，毛泽东思想，又有了人民日报天天指引，再加上人民已经大翻身，而且掀起了如火如荼的三大运动，于是我从接受党的教育的实践中睁开了眼，看出一切问题都是阶级斗争问题。学了一两年才学回了头，原来一切集中在《共产党宣言》的第一句。人的一切活动过程都是阶级斗争，而要有斗争就要有组织，有党的领导，不然就还是悬在空中，仿佛超然而实际是东倒西歪不自知。
    自觉地参加到阶级斗争里去，在今天中国就是自觉地随着中国共产党进行革命斗争，在这样的斗争中，尽管投出的不是手榴弹而只是石头，可是这一来就真正认识了革命。以前看马克思列宁主义的书，仿佛一般人看佛经，字字识，句句懂，可是隔了一层，不知说的是什么。这样学习马克思列宁主义就似通非通，隔靴搔痒，这就是因为没有大喊一声，随着人民解放军投出一颗石头。
    这样一来，仿佛是学习到了头了。然而不然，这才算是刚刚起来。这一颗石头投出去，毛泽东思想对于我就立刻是活的了。他就是教我们怎样接着投下去一直投到彻底胜利的。行动才需要学理论，而学理论就必须行动。学习战斗必须扛枪举步，而决不是坐在屋里朗诵步兵操典。对于蹲惯了黑窟窿的猫头鹰，在阳光下面飞翔是痛苦的。同样，对于习惯于把读书当做唯一的学习的人，我敢说，学习战斗是极艰苦的。对知识分子说，学习阶级斗争比读遍万卷书难，比精通任何语文难，比上下古今无所不知无所不晓还要难。我这时才明白为什么“联共党史”是马克思列宁主义基础，为什么熟读《资本论》的马克思学者并不能就算马克思主义者。学军事就是学打仗，学打仗就是学军队，学马克思列宁主义毛泽东思想就是学党。离开了党一切都是空谈。
    “深入群众，不尚空谈。”这就是毛主席的指示。
    在悠长的时间中闭着眼旋转而自以为跑了不少路，今天到了党的三十岁生日，我才知道向党说：原来你教了我这么多年我还是没有动步啊！好了，尽管一动步就会跌交也罢，跌倒了再爬起来往前走，从此我跟定了你作万里长征！
    我就拿这篇小文作我对党的伟大寿辰的渺不足道的献礼吧。
    伟大的共产党，伟大的毛主席万岁！
