　　Some Experiences in Playwriting
    ——Speech at the National Art Troupe Work Conference
    Lao She
    Here, I would like to share a few words about my recent experiences in learning to write plays and my心得 from reading anti-U.S. aggression and aid Korea plays. If what I say is correct, please use it as a reference; if not, please point out my mistakes and criticize me.
    Let me divide it into points, although which one comes first and which one comes later is just a random arrangement and not very important.
    First, let's talk about the issue of "meeting deadlines." When "meeting deadlines" is mentioned, many people might frown immediately. Some people think that literary and artistic works cannot be "rushed," and that if they are "rushed," they will not be well written. Some people who have personally rushed to meet deadlines also apologetically declare to others: "It was rushed, not good, not good!" The former believes that literary and artistic workers should not rush to meet deadlines, and the latter explains that even if they do rush, they will inevitably not do well.
    I think no one knows the joys and sorrows of "meeting deadlines" as much or as deeply as the comrades working in the art troupes. That's why I'm willing to raise this issue in front of all of you representatives. I believe that the good achievements of art troupes in various places in the past are largely related to meeting deadlines. If the creators of art troupes in various places had always been leisurely and unwilling to rush to meet deadlines, I'm afraid their performance would have been greatly reduced, right? Precisely because they have the enthusiasm and courage to create in a timely manner, they can step forward, create what should be publicized, and educate the people in a timely manner. This affirms the achievements and glory of art troupes in various places. With achievements, creative accomplishments and confidence will gradually improve, this is certain; isn't literary and artistic work the same as other kinds of work, where the more you learn and practice, the more confident you become?
    Although I don't work in an art troupe myself, I also rush to meet deadlines. I don't have the ability to "predict the future," so how could I have known in advance that the Beijing Municipal People's Government was going to build the Dragon Beard Ditch? It was only after the Dragon Beard Ditch started construction that I rushed to catch up. Isn't this also meeting a deadline?
    My explanation for this issue is this:
    Meeting deadlines is not only appropriate, but also glorious.
    If others don't rush, we rush; others will have no achievements, but we will have achievements.
    Works that are rushed may not all be good, but those who never rush will not even have bad works. We should not lose the courage and enthusiasm to rush writing for fear that the work will not be good!
    What needs even more attention is that when we accept a task, we should be determined to have the confidence to succeed, instead of frowning and sighing first. There are some famous literary works in the world that were rushed. I know that Shakespeare and Dickens both rushed to meet deadlines, and they did it very well. Rushing to write is not the same as shoddy workmanship. We must set a convention for meeting deadlines: we must happily accept tasks and be determined to write them well! If we have a high degree of political enthusiasm and sensitivity to new things, we can indeed write good works in a short period of time.
    Second, we must despise the clichés of Hollywood and Broadway. When creating a play, we must seek formal integrity. But formal integrity is not the same as putting new content into an old mold, knocking out a complete but lifeless clay figure in the same way. Hollywood and Broadway often play this trick of knocking out clay figures to make money; but we must not do this. In our society today, thousands of new things appear every day; our writing materials are inexhaustible. Then why should we adopt the already stale clichés of Hollywood and Broadway to express our new things? We must boldly create, even if the form is slightly flawed, it is much better than using those clichés and platitudes. We are now Chinese people who have raised our heads, and we should enthusiastically and seriously write about our new characters and new things, and absolutely not steal artistic forms from Hollywood.
    I have seen a short play, the content of which is about how enthusiastically everyone joins the army. Joining the army is a glorious thing. However, the protagonist in this play signed up very early, but didn't say a word, so everyone suspected whether he had patriotism. It wasn't until the play was almost over that everyone realized that he had already signed up and been approved. You see, what's the point of this? This is being poisoned by Hollywood, thinking that it's not a play if it's not so "full of twists and turns." This is deliberately showing off skills, even at the expense of damaging the positive portrayal of heroic figures. As a result, the audience goes around many corners and only sees part of the hero's appearance, because his entire face has been buried by the complicated structure! After careful calculation, this kind of "sacrifice" is really not worth it! We are not against using skills, but if we leave the positive portrayal of new characters and new things because of the importance of skills, or even make the character's personality submit to skills, making him a awkward and inexplicable person, our loss will be great. Our era is an era of heroes; in factories, in rural areas, in the army, new heroes appear every day. The task of us creators is to positively portray and praise these heroes, not to make heroes become accessories of the play's structure and skills.
    I have also seen a short opera, the content of which is about a combat hero returning home to see his lover. His lover, in the years that her husband was in the army, also became a model figure in the countryside. In theory, this should be a joyful and enthusiastic play! After the husband and wife meet, they should talk about their achievements in the past few years, there should be a lot of drama to be made! However, our playwright did not make the husband and wife passionately embrace each other when they met, but made the hero suddenly think of teasing his lover, saying that he had deserted and returned, deliberately making her cry. This is unreasonable! Our playwright probably thought that it was not enough to show the high level of skills unless he did this, but in fact, this little trick fully explained how vulgar and boring he was. This is a new Mulberry Garden Meeting, and our hero has become Qiu Hu because of the manipulation of dramatic skills!
    From the two examples cited above, we can see clearly that today, among us, there are still people who think that theatrical creation is just about showing off skills, and that the task is completed as long as an old set of patterns is put on. This is not right! On the contrary, our drama today is to face new characters and new things, and make a dignified portrayal and praise; the path of Hollywood and Qiu Hu teasing his wife is the path of going into a dead end, which will turn drama into an empty format, a set of numbers, a soulless thing.
    I myself am a latecomer to writing plays. My biggest shortcoming is that I don't understand the techniques of the stage. However, this also has advantages, that is, I am not controlled by techniques, and techniques have not become my command. Today, I am very willing to learn stage techniques, but I also keep in mind that I must not take techniques as the starting point for writing plays, and I must not put dignified characters and things into curved horns to suffer.
    Third, the content should not be a set of patterns either. It is undeniable that our creation is somewhat behind the development of society. Society is advancing too fast, and our hearts and hands are too slow. Because we can't keep up with the rapid progress of society, we cling to the old and write about old things from a few years ago, or rewrite things that others have written before. This attitude is not good! Today, if we are still writing about the transformation of hooligans in the early days of liberation, we ourselves will become "third-rate"!
    Now, every day we open the newspaper, don't we immediately discover that new people and new things are appearing in factories, rural areas, troops, schools, shops, and families all over the country? Why must we hold on to the hooligans and not let go? It is true that society is moving too fast; however, we cannot excuse ourselves for this. We should also catch up. George Bernard Shaw said that when creative power declines, one thinks of writing historical plays. We don't have to completely believe this sentence. However, we must be determined not to let our pens fall behind society. It is our primary task to timely praise and commend our new people and new things. We should not always sit in the house reading works from the old liberated areas in order to imitate, but should go outside to find new, living materials.
    Fourth, we must also create with careful calculation. The economic construction of our entire country, at the current stage, requires us to be careful in everything we do. I think that we who create plays should not be an exception. When I write a play myself, I always want to use fewer people and fewer scenes, so as to save manpower and financial resources during the performance. I know that I should not adopt the method of cutting feet to fit shoes; however, I also know that striving for simplicity is not impossible to write a good play, then our artistic success will be tied to our patriotism, wouldn't it be the best of both worlds.
    I have seen plays where the costumes, scenery, and props are very exquisite, but the play is not good. I have also seen plays with no scenery or props that can be very moving. Needless to say, under our current economic conditions, the latter type of play must be more desirable, because it not only achieves the effect of drama, but also saves rice.
    I think that when art troupes exchange experiences and conduct observational performances with each other, deviations are likely to occur, that is, small art troupes with poorer material conditions will envy the stage arrangements of large art troupes with better material conditions, and want to imitate them. It is true that drama is a comprehensive art, and it is not wrong to pay attention to lighting, props, costumes, scenery, etc. However, under our economic conditions, we must make calculations and not allow waste. We all know that when Shakespeare was alive, his plays, although performed according to the simple stage conditions of that era, did not hinder his greatness. We should pay attention to scenery and lighting, etc., but we must not specialize in them to win, like juggling with mechanical scenery like a circus troupe. If a playwright, when planning to create, proudly tells us: "Wait and see, my play has fifteen scenes and uses more than seventy characters, it's very great!" We must tell him: "If you can use two scenes and ten characters, maybe you will show more skill and be greater!"
    Yes, when our economic climax comes in the future, we will definitely see magnificent and splendid dramas appearing all over the country; however, today, when we create scripts, we must think of using one penny as two, making our scripts concise, solid, and economical.
    Fifth, in my two plays "Fang Pearl" and "Dragon Beard Ditch", the first half is a depiction of the scene before liberation, so it is inevitable that it is dim and tragic. Even so, I kept in mind not to make the stage too terrible and too ugly. Today, because of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, opposing the armed forces of Japan, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, many accusation plays have appeared on our stage. These plays often emphasize the memories of how Japanese beast soldiers slaughtered us, and how counter-revolutionary elements raped, murdered, and looted, making the entire stage full of blood and tragic cries. I think we should restrain ourselves a little, and not exaggerate the enemy's spirit too much and diminish our own prestige. It seems that we should, on the one hand, describe the enemy's brutality appropriately, and on the other hand, also write about our strong resistance and indomitable facts and spirit. If we only concretely show the enemy's slaughter, wouldn't we become a group of cattle and sheep? The purpose of accusation plays is to arouse the audience's grief and indignation, and then turn grief and indignation into strength to resist and eliminate the enemy. If we only exaggerate the enemy's atrocities and create terror, I am afraid that the opposite effect will occur, making the audience afraid but not angry.
    Similarly, I feel that on the stage, our tears are too convenient, and we cry at every turn, and our knees are too soft, and we kneel down as soon as the enemy raises a hand. Crying does not necessarily move people, but it easily describes us as weak and incompetent; kneeling is also the same. Today, we are people who have raised our heads, and we must describe our composure and strength more, and not cry or kneel casually. Even literary works that are mainly about accusations must be like this. Crying, shouting, and kneeling, even if used appropriately, also have the danger of uglifying our people.
    Sixth, and the last point, I would like to talk about the use of language in the script. I feel that one of the bad phenomena in today's scripts is that the dialogue often expresses the playwright's thoughts, not the thoughts of the characters in the play. The playwright's thought is to promote resistance to U.S. aggression and aid Korea, or suppress counter-revolutionaries, so he teaches the characters in the play to shout out to overthrow American imperialism and overthrow special agents after three or two turns. In this way, the characters in the play become the playwright's microphone, and the language in the play cannot be exciting or moving. We must make the dialogue in the play inevitable due to the plot, not suddenly flying in from the outside.
    Because the playwright did not consider the above point, he often thinks that drama is a very convenient thing, he can say whatever he wants, and he can make a character in the play say many unrelated things. This is a mistake. A play must have its main facts and a certain propaganda purpose, it cannot be all-encompassing, and it cannot say everything that needs to be promoted today all at once. We must hold on to one point and say it, and not pull east and west. If we don't talk nonsense, we can write heartfelt words according to the development of the plot and characters. Only heartfelt words are enough to move people.
    Language itself is neither good nor bad. If used in the right place, one or two ordinary words can make people angry and excited; if used incorrectly, even if you use "roar," "angry grapes," or "angry flames," the audience will still be unmoved. We must use language, and not let language control us. The quality of language does not depend on whether you use "angry flames" or not, but on whether it can arouse the audience's angry flames. We should despise non-popular words like "angry flames," and should not worship them. If someone thinks that the artistic quality of a work depends entirely on "angry flames" to support it, then it is building a house on sand.
    Because we describe workers, peasants, and soldiers, we often use many terms from factories, farming, and the army. In my opinion, this method also needs to be reconsidered. If we use terminology, it must be because the plot in the play has an inseparable relationship with the terminology, and not to show off our knowledge of factories, rural areas, and troops by using terminology. Terminology is not something that the general audience can understand. To show off our knowledge with something that everyone doesn't understand is like quack doctors using yin and yang, the five elements, and upper burner fire to deceive patients. Our proper attitude is to not use terminology if we can avoid it. Even if it is unavoidable, we should try to make the audience understand. I know some artists' "坎儿", but when I wrote "Fang Pearl", I tried my best to avoid using them, for fear that the audience would not understand. Using them was originally to enhance the atmosphere, but if the audience doesn't understand, how can the atmosphere be created? Recently, I wrote another script, which required a valuable surgical instrument. I asked a surgeon for advice. He said that the blood suction device used during surgery is very valuable. "Blood suction device" is not a very difficult noun to understand, but I still think it sounds bad and not very popular. I decided not to use it. I also needed a disease name, and a doctor thought for a long time before telling me that "pulmonary hemorrhage" was the most suitable. However, I still felt it was too stiff, so I changed it to "the lung bled".
    Some people praised me, saying that my dialogue was written quite well. Maybe that's the case, because I have put a lot of effort into using language. I don't let terminology help me, but carefully select and mobilize them. More importantly, I first regard a doctor as one of us, instead of seeing him as someone who always prescribes prescriptions all day long. In this way, I can find living language from the relationship between people, instead of holding a medical dictionary to write dialogue.
    The six points mentioned above may be called experiences. However, to bring them to the workers of the art troupe is a bit like showing off one's axe in front of Lu Ban, please correct me!

　　剧本习作的一些经验
    ——在全国文工团工作会议上的发言
    老舍
    在这里，我愿就近来我自己学习写剧本的经验，和阅读抗美援朝的剧本的心得，说几句话。说对了的，请诸位代表们作参考，不对的，请指教批评。
    让我分条来说；虽然哪条在先，哪条在后，是随便排列，无关紧要的。
    第一、我们先说“赶任务”这个问题吧。一提起“赶任务”，或者就有不少人赶紧皱起眉来。有的人以为文艺作品是不能“赶”的，一“赶”就写不好。有的人亲自赶了任务，也抱歉的对别人声明：“赶出来的，不好，不好！”前者是以为文艺工作者不应当赶任务，后者是说明即使去赶，也必然赶不好。
    “赶任务”里边的甘苦，我想谁也不能像文工团的工作同志们知道的那么多，那么深，所以我愿意在诸位代表面前提出这个问题来，我以为各地文工团过去的良好成绩是与赶任务大有关系的。假若各文工团的创作者向来从从容容，不肯去赶任务，恐怕他们的表现就要减少很多了吧？唯其他们有及时创作的热情与魄力，所以才能迎上前去，把该宣传的创作出来，及时的教育了人民。这样，就肯定了各地文工团的成绩与光荣。有了成绩，也就渐渐地提高了创作上的成就与信心，这是一定的；文艺工作也和别种工作一样，不是越多学习，多练习，才越有把握么？
    我自己虽不在文工团里工作，可是我也赶任务。我没有“能掐会算”的本事，怎么能预先知道北京市人民政府要修建龙须沟呢？龙须沟动了工，我才赶上前去。这还不是赶任务么？
    对这一问题，我的解释是这样的：
    赶任务不单是应该的，而且是光荣的。
    别人不赶，我们赶，别人就没有成绩，而我们有成绩。
    赶出来的作品不一定都好，但是永远不肯赶的，就连不好的作品也没有。我们不应当为怕作品不好，就失去赶写的勇气和热情！
    更须注意的，当我们一接受任务的时候，就抱定能胜利成功的信心，而不要皱上眉，先叹一口气。世界上有一些文艺名著是赶写出来的。我知道，莎士比亚和迭更司都赶过任务，而且赶得很好。赶写并不与粗制滥造同一意义。我们须定个赶任务的公约：我们要欢欢喜喜的接受任务，而且立志要把它写好！我们若具有高度的政治热情，与深入新事体的敏感，我们确是能把作品在短时间内写好的。
    第二、我们要鄙视好莱坞与百老汇的俗套子。创作剧本，须求形式上的完整。但形式的完整并不等于把新内容放在一个老模子里，照样的磕出一个完整而没有生气的泥人儿来。好莱坞与百老汇常常玩这种磕泥人儿的把戏，为是赚钱；我们却不可如此。在我们今天的社会里，每天都有千万样新事体出现；我们的写作素材是取之不竭的。那么，我们为什么要采用好莱坞与百老汇已经陈腐了的俗套子，来表现我们的新事体呢？我们要放胆的去创作，就是形式稍有缺陷，也比袭用那些俗套滥调强的多。我们现在是抬起了头来的中国人，我们就应当热情的、严肃的，去写我们的新人物新事体，而且绝对不向好莱坞偷取艺术形式。
    我看见过一出小戏，内容是讲大家怎样热烈的参军。参军是光荣的事。可是，此剧中的主角，很早就报了名，却一声不出，以致大家都猜疑他是否有爱国心。直到戏快完了，大家才知道他早已报名，而且被批准。你看，这是何苦呢？这是中了好莱坞的毒，以为不这么“跌宕曲折”就不算个戏。这是故意耍弄技巧，虽然因此而损害了对具有英雄气概的人物的正面描写，亦在所不惜。结果呢，观众绕了许多湾子才只看见了英雄形相的一部分，因为他的全部面貌已被钩心斗角的结构给埋起去了啊。细细合计起来，这种“牺牲”实在太不上算！我们不反对运用技巧，但是因重视技巧而离开正面描写新人物新事体，或者竟自使人物的性格屈就技巧，使他成为别别扭扭莫明其妙的人，我们的损失就很大了。我们的时代是英雄的时代，在工厂，在农村，在部队里，每天都有新英雄的出现。我们创作者的任务是正面的描画，表扬这些英雄，而不是使英雄们变成剧本结构与技巧的附属品。
    我还看过一出小歌剧，内容是一位战斗英雄回家，看他的爱人。他的爱人，在丈夫从军去的几年内，在乡间也成了模范人物。按道理说，这该是多么欢快的，热情的一出戏呢！夫妻见面后，各道几年来奋斗的成绩，该有多少戏可作呢！可是，我们的剧作者，却不使夫妻相会时热烈的拥抱，而使那位英雄忽然想起去戏弄他的爱人，说他自己是开小差回来的，故意使她落了泪。这不近人情！我们的剧作者大概是以为非如此不足以见技巧的高明，而事实上，这点技巧是充分的说明了他怎样的庸俗，无聊。这是一出新桑园会，我们的英雄竟自因戏剧技巧的摆弄而变成了秋胡！
    从上面举出的两个例子，我们看清楚：今天在我们之中，还有人以为戏剧创作只是耍耍技巧，只要套好了一个旧套子便算完成了任务。这是不对的！相反的，我们今天的戏剧是要面向着新人物新事体，作堂堂正正的描画与表扬；好莱坞与秋胡戏妻的路子是钻牛犄角的路子，他会使戏剧变成空洞的格式、套数，没有灵魂的东西。
    我自己写戏，本是半路出家。我的最大的缺点是不懂舞台上的技巧。可是，这也有好处，就是我不为技巧所左右，技巧没有变成我的指挥。今天，我很愿意去学习舞台技巧，但是我也留着神，一定不以技巧作写戏的出发点，一定不要把堂堂正正的人物与事体放在弯弯曲曲的牛犄角里去受罪。
    第三、内容也不要套套子。无可否认的，我们的创作是有些落在社会发展的后边。社会前进的太快，我们的心与手太慢。我们因为赶不上社会的突飞猛进，于是就抱残守缺的写几年前的旧事，或者把别人写过的东西改头换面再写一回。这态度不好！在今天，假若我们还写解放初期的二流子改造，我们自己就成了“三流子”！
    现在，每天打开报纸，我们不是马上发现，全国各处的工厂里、农村里、部队里、学校里、商店里、家庭里都有新人新事的出现么？我们为什么一定抱着二流子不撒手呢？不错，社会的确走得太快了；可是，我们却不能以此而原谅自己。我们也应当赶上前去。萧伯纳说过，当创作力衰落的时候，才想写历史剧。我们不必完全相信这句话。但是，我们必须立志不叫我们的笔落在社会后边。能及时的歌颂表扬我们的新人新事正是我们的首要任务。我们不应当老坐在屋里阅读老解放区的作品，以便摩仿，而应当到门外去找那新的、活生生的资料。
    第四、我们也要精打细算的创作。我们整个国家的经济建设，在现阶段中，要求我们无论作什么都须精打细算。我想，我们创作剧本的人也不应该是例外。在我自己写剧本的时候，我总愿意少用人，少用景，好在演出的时候省些人力财力。我知道，我不应当采取削足适履的办法；但是，我也知道，力求精简，也不是不能写出好戏来，那么我们的艺术上的成功就和我们的爱国心结系到一处了，岂不是两全其美么。
    我看见过这样的戏：服装、布景、道具，都很讲究，可是戏很不好。我也看见过没有什么布景、道具，而很能感动人的戏。用不着细说，在我们今日的经济条件下，后一类的戏一定是更可取的，因为它不单收到戏剧的效果，而且节省了小米。
    我想，当文工团彼此交流经验，作观摩演出的时候，很可能的会发生偏差，就是小的，物质条件差一些的文工团会羡慕大的，物质条件好些的文工团的舞台上的布置，而想去摩仿。不错，戏剧是综合的艺术，注意到灯光、道具、服装、布景等等，不能算是错误。可是，在我们的经济条件之下，我们就须打打算盘，不许浪费。我们都知道，当莎士比亚活着的时候，他的戏虽是按照那时代的简陋舞台条件演出的，可是也并没妨碍了他的伟大。我们应当注意布景灯光等等，但不可专以它们见胜，像彩头班子那样耍弄机关布景似的。假若一位剧作者，在计划着创作的时候，很得意的告诉我们：“等着看吧，我的戏有十五个景，用七十多个角色，伟大的很！”我们便须告诉他：“假若你能用两个景，十个角色，也许更见本事，更伟大！”
    是的，将来我们的经济高潮来到的时候，我们一定可以看到堂皇富丽的戏剧在全国各地出现；可是，在今天，我们在创作剧本的时候，便须想到一个钱当两个钱用，教我们的剧本简练、结实，而且省钱。
    第五、在我的《方珍珠》与《龙须沟》二剧中，前半都是描写解放前的光景，所以都不免暗淡凄惨。即便是这样，我可也留着神，不叫舞台上太可怕，太丑恶。今天，因为抗美援朝，反对武装日本，和镇压反革命，我们的舞台上出现了不少控诉的戏。这些戏里往往强调了回忆日本兽兵怎样屠杀我们，和反革命分子如何奸淫杀掠，弄得满台上鲜血淋漓，悲嚎惨叫。我以为，我们应当收敛一些，别太夸张敌人的锐气，灭自己的威风。我们似乎应当一方面适可而止的描写敌人的残暴，另一方面也要写出我们的坚强抵抗，不屈不挠的事实与精神来。若是一味具体的表现敌人屠杀，我们岂不成了一群牛羊了么？控诉戏的目的在激起观众的悲愤，然后化悲愤为力量，去反抗，去消灭敌人。若只夸张敌人的兽行，造成恐怖，恐怕就要发生相反的效果，使观众怕而不愤了。
    同样的，我觉得在舞台上，我们的眼泪未免太方便，动不动的就哭起来，我们的磕膝也太软，敌人一抬手，我们就跪下。哭，不见得准能感动人，而很容易把我们形容成软弱无能；跪，也是如此。今天，我们是抬起了头来的人，我们必须多描写我们的沉毅刚强，不随便的哭，跪。即便是以控诉为主的文艺作品，也须如此。哭叫、屈膝，即使用适得当，也有丑化了我们人民的危险。
    第六、也是最后的一段，我想谈谈剧本中运用语言的问题。我觉得，今天剧本中的一个不好的现象，就是对话往往表现了剧作者的思想，而不是表现剧中人的思想。剧作者的思想是要宣传抗美援朝，或镇压反革命，于是，他就教剧中人三转两转喊叫出来打倒美帝国主义，打倒特务分子。这样，剧中人就变成了剧作者的麦克风，而剧中的语言便不能精彩，不能动人。我们必须作到，剧中的对话是情节所至，必然如此的，而不是忽然由外边飞来的。
    因为剧作者没有考虑到上面所说的一点，所以他往往以为戏剧是很方便的东西，要说什么就说什么，而且可以使一个剧中人说出许多不相关的事来。这是个错误。一本戏必有它的主要事实与一定的宣传目的，它不能包罗万象，一下子把今天所要宣传的都说干净。我们要抱定一点去说，不许东拉西扯。不乱扯，我们才能依照着情节与人物的发展写出掏心窝子的话来。也只有掏心窝子的话才足以打动人。
    语言本身是没有什么好与不好的。用对了地方，一两个普通字，便能使人愤怒、激动；用的不对，尽管用上“怒吼罢”，“愤怒的葡萄”，或“愤怒的火焰”，台下还是毫不动心。我们要运用语言，而不教语言控制着我们。语言的好坏不决定于用上“愤怒的火焰”与否，而在它能否激起听众的愤怒的火焰。我们应当鄙视“愤怒的火焰”这类的不通俗的词汇，而不应当崇拜它们。假若有人以为作品的文艺性全仗着“愤怒的火焰”来支持，那便是把房子盖在沙土上。
    我们为描写工农兵，所以往往采用许多工厂、农作、和部队中的术语。这个办法，据我看，也须再斟酌一下。我们若用术语，必是因为剧中的情节与术语有不可分离的关系，而不是借术语来夸示我们对工厂、农村、与部队的知识。术语不是一般观众所能懂的，以大家所不懂的东西来夸示我们的知识，就等于庸医用阴阳五行、上焦火旺等等，去欺骗病人一样。我们应有的态度，倒是能不用术语就不用。即使非用不可，我们也该设法使听众能够懂。我知道一些艺人们的“坎儿”，可是在我写《方珍珠》的时候，我就尽力避免利用它们，怕听众不懂。用了它们，本来是为增强气氛，不过，台下若听不懂，怎能造成气氛呢？最近，我写另一个剧本，其中需要一件贵重的外科治疗器具。我去求教一位外科医生。他说开刀时用的吸血器很贵重。“吸血器”不算很难懂的一个名词，但是我到底觉得它不好听，不顶通俗。我决定不用它。我又需要一个病名，一位医生给我想了半天，才告诉我“肺出血”最合用。可是，我还觉得它太生硬，所以把它改为“肺出了血”。
    有人夸奖我，说我的对话写得相当的好。也许是这样吧，因为我在运用语言上用过一番工夫。我不教术语来帮助我，而是谨慎选择的由我调动它们。更重要的，是我先把一位医生，看成为咱们中间的一个人，而不把他看成一天到晚老开药方的人。这样，我就可以从人与人之间的关系中找出活的语言来，而不抱着医学大词典去写对话。
    以上所提出来的六条，美其名也或者可以叫作经验之谈吧。不过，拿到文工团工作者们的面前来说，不免有点班门弄斧了，请诸位指正！
