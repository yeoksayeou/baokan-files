　　Xinhua News Agency Report: Tsinghua University Professor Hua Luogeng and others expressed that the work of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea must not be relaxed due to the Korean armistice negotiations, but must be redoubled and continuously strengthened.

　　Hua Luogeng, Feng Youlan, Lei Haizong, Wu Zuxiang, Pan Guangdan, Zhou Peiyuan, Wu Jingchao and other thirty professors from Tsinghua University gathered on the 5th to discuss the Korean armistice issue. Everyone unanimously believed that the fact that Ridgway accepted the armistice negotiation proposal fully demonstrated that the arrogant US imperialism had suffered a serious blow, and the heroic struggle of the Chinese and Korean people had achieved a major victory. They also believed that over the past year, through various practical struggles, everyone has clearly recognized the true face of US imperialism, and no matter what tricks it plays, its aggressive nature will not change. Therefore, everyone should resolutely respond to the call of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea on July 4th and continue to strengthen the work of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea. First of all, we must redouble our efforts to carry out the production increase and donation campaign, and we must complete all specific production increase and donation plans. At the same time, we must conscientiously carry out the work of providing preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel; mobilize young students to participate in military cadre schools, and continue to carry out propaganda on resisting US aggression and aiding Korea to the masses. In addition, we must ensure that the patriotic pact movement continues to be carried out in depth, and conduct inspections at any time so that every clause in the patriotic pact can be earnestly implemented.

    必须加强爱国工作  再接再厉抗美援朝
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：清华大学教授华罗庚等，表示抗美援朝工作绝不能因朝鲜停战谈判而松懈，而必须再接再厉，继续加强。
    清华大学华罗庚、冯友兰、雷海宗、吴组缃、潘光旦、周培源、吴景超等三十位教授于五日集会座谈朝鲜停战问题，大家一致认为：李奇微接受停战谈判建议的事实，充分说明一向虚骄狂妄的美帝国主义，已经受到了严重的打击，中朝人民的英勇斗争已经获得了重大胜利。他们并认为：一年以来，从各种实际斗争中，大家已清楚地认识了美帝国主义的真面目，不论它玩弄什么花样，其侵略本质是不变的。因此，大家要坚决响应中国人民抗美援朝总会七月四日的号召，继续加强抗美援朝工作。首先，我们要再接再厉，开展增产捐献运动，一定要全部完成具体的增产捐献计划。同时，要认真进行优抚革命烈士家属、军人家属的工作；动员青年学生参加军事干部学校，并继续向群众进行关于抗美援朝的宣传。此外，要保证继续深入开展爱国公约运动，并随时进行检查，使爱国公约中的每一条文，都能认真实施。
