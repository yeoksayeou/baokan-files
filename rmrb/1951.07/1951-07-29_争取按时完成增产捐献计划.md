　　Strive to Complete the Production Increase and Donation Plan on Time

People across the country have enthusiastically responded to the call from the China Peace Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea issued on June 1st to donate airplanes and cannons. As of July 23rd, they had collectively pledged and initiated pledges for 2,253 airplanes, 130 cannons, 60 anti-aircraft guns, and 10 tanks. This movement continues to develop. Many regions are successively paying the donated funds. Some units, such as the workers of the Shanghai Electric Power Company, have appropriately donated bonuses in conjunction with their increased production tasks, and have completed their pledged "Shanghai Electric Power" aircraft. This large-scale donation movement has once again demonstrated the enthusiasm of the Chinese people for loving their country and their magnificent and unparalleled power.

However, from a nationwide perspective, the depth and breadth of the patriotic production increase and donation movement are still uneven. There are imbalances between major administrative regions, and also imbalances between provinces, cities, and counties. Generally speaking, about a quarter of the country has not yet deeply launched this movement. In the regions that have already pledged and initiated pledges, the actual payment figures are still not large, and some have failed to meet the donation plan on time. Therefore, in order to strive to complete the production increase and donation plan on time, we must make great and persistent efforts. We believe that in areas where the donation of aircraft and artillery has not yet been initiated, the production increase and donation movement should continue to be promoted. In areas where aircraft and artillery have already been pledged and initiated, efforts should be made to quickly and accurately complete the pledged amounts.

What are the reasons why the donation movement has not been initiated, or why the plan has not been completed on time even though the donation movement has been initiated?

First, the publicity and education work has not been carried out in depth. Some local leading organs believe that "the masses are all patriotic, and a call will complete the task." Therefore, they do not conduct political education among the masses regarding the increase in production and donation of weapons. Some local leading organs even mistakenly adopt the method of administrative orders and equal apportionment. As a result, the local masses cannot consciously and enthusiastically participate in the movement. On the other hand, some local leading organs underestimate the patriotic enthusiasm and donation power of the masses, and inappropriately limit the amount of donations from the masses, suppressing the enthusiasm of the masses. This is also incorrect.

Second, only empty propaganda is carried out, without pointing out to the masses the direction and specific methods of the donation movement, and without turning the principle of increasing production and donation into the actions of the masses. Therefore, a considerable number of people have taken some inappropriate measures in order to fulfill their promise to donate weapons: they either simply save and donate, such as some office workers or students donating pens necessary for work and study, and even donating through fasting, or they undertake excessive and unduly heavy social labor unrelated to their own business in order to donate weapons; some workers donate wages exceeding their ability to bear; and some emancipated farmers donate all or most of the fruits of struggle. It should be pointed out that the patriotic enthusiasm of these people is commendable, but the methods are inappropriate. Simply adopting these methods will never complete the task of donating weapons.

The large-scale donation of weapons movement has led the movement to resist America and aid Korea to a climax. The problem now is to strengthen leadership, come up with more methods, and truly implement the surging patriotic enthusiasm of the masses into daily work, turning it into a great and unparalleled material force. To this end, it is necessary to:

First, continue to carry out regular and timely current affairs and political education. In the movement to resist America and aid Korea, the people have generally received patriotic education, recognized the reactionary nature of American imperialism, and enhanced their determination and confidence to resist American imperialism. However, in the future, it is still necessary to regularly conduct patriotic political education among the masses to further improve their political understanding and to correct some erroneous understandings that some people have developed due to the new development of the situation in Korea in a timely manner. Some people believe that since the Korean armistice negotiations are now underway, "there is no need to donate airplanes and cannons." This understanding is completely wrong and will hinder the progress of the donation movement. Therefore, it should be combined with specific facts to repeatedly explain to the masses: American imperialism is still occupying our Taiwan, is still actively arming Japan, and still does not intend to completely resolve the Korean issue. All of this proves that it has not abandoned its policy of aggression against China and the Far East. It proves that American imperialism was and still is our mortal enemy today. Therefore, only by establishing a strong national defense force can we guarantee the security of our country and guarantee the construction of the country and the happy life of the people. In fact, American imperialism still occasionally uses aircraft to invade our airspace during the armistice negotiations. On the 21st of this month, eight enemy aircraft invaded our northeast airspace more deeply than in the past. However, seven of them were shot down by our heroic air force. This incident once again proves the extreme importance of strengthening our national defense forces and building a strong air force and navy. As long as we conduct such vivid and practical current affairs and political education to the masses at any time, so that the masses clearly recognize the importance of strengthening the national defense forces, then the masses will consciously and actively complete the plan to donate aircraft and artillery.

Second, and more importantly, implement the principle of increasing production and donation, and lead the units and individuals who have already pledged to find ways to increase production and donation. Increasing production is the material basis of the donation movement. This principle is beneficial to both the country and the individual when put into practice. Local party and government leading organs should promote trade unions, chambers of commerce, trade associations, and other organizations to lead and help organs, workshops, businesses, and individuals to formulate production increase and donation plans that are combined with their own businesses, and promote them to gradually realize them. This plan must be specific and should include methods for increasing production, sources of donation funds, and figures for payment on time and on a monthly basis. This specific plan, coupled with mass inspection and supervision, can be completed on time and will not fail. Beijing Daoxiangchun and other businesses have determined a production increase and donation plan facing the countryside, popularizing business, making small profits and selling more, and saving expenses through labor-management consultation. This method is practical and feasible and should be promoted.

Third, in order to effectively complete the donation plan, the donation plan should be combined with the patriotic pact, and the production increase and donation plan should be listed as one of the main contents of the patriotic pact. In the process of inspecting patriotic pacts, all localities should focus on checking the implementation of production increase and donation plans. Help units that have not signed contracts to sign them quickly, and help units that have already signed contracts to modify and enrich the content of the contracts. The Ma Hengchang team revised the team's patriotic competition pact, striving to over fulfill the production task by 10% within half a year, donating 50% of the bonus and one day's salary per month to purchase airplanes and cannons. This practice of combining patriotic pacts, labor competitions, and donation plans can be adopted in all localities.

On the basis of the unprecedented upsurge of patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses, coupled with meticulous and in-depth leadership, we believe that the production increase and donation plans of the people in all localities can be successfully completed.

### 争取按时完成增产捐献计划

　　争取按时完成增产捐献计划
    全国各地人民热烈响应抗美援朝总会六月一日发出的捐献飞机大炮的号召，截至七月二十三日止，已共认捐和发起认捐飞机二千二百五十三架，大炮一百三十门，高射炮六十门，坦克十辆。这一运动仍在继续发展中。许多地区，正在陆续缴纳捐献的款项。有些单位，例如上海电力公司工人，结合增产任务，适当地捐献奖金，已把他们认捐的“上电号”飞机完成了。这一个大规模的捐献运动，再一次表现了我国人民热爱祖国的积极性及其雄伟无比的力量。
    但是，在全国范围内看来，爱国增产捐献运动的深度和广度，还是不平衡的。各大行政区间不平衡，各省、市、县间也不平衡。总的说来，全国约有四分之一的地区，尚未深入开展这一运动。而在已经认捐和发起认捐的地区，实际缴款数字也还不大，有的未能按期实现捐献计划。因此，为了争取按时完成增产捐献计划，还须作巨大、持久的努力。我们认为：在还没有发起认捐飞机大炮的地区，应该继续推广增产捐献运动。已经认捐和发起认捐飞机大炮的地区，则应争取迅速而准确地完成已认捐的数目。
    尚未发起捐献运动，或虽已发起捐献运动但未能按期完成计划的原因在那里呢？
    第一、宣传教育工作做得不深入。有些地区的领导机关，认为“群众都是爱国的，一个号召，任务就可完成”。因此，他们就不向群众进行关于增产捐献武器的政治教育，甚至有的地方的领导机关，更错误地采取了行政命令平均摊派的办法，结果，当地群众就不可能自觉地热烈地参加运动。另一方面，有的地方领导机关，过低地估计了群众的爱国热情和捐献力量，不恰当地限制群众捐献的数字，压抑了群众的积极性，这也是不对的。
    第二、只进行空洞的宣传，而不向群众指出捐献运动的方向和具体办法，没有把增产捐献的原则，变成群众的行动。因此，有相当数量的人，为了实现自己捐献武器的诺言，就采取了一些不适当的办法：他们或则是单纯节约捐献，如有的机关工作人员或学生，捐出工作、学习所必需的钢笔，甚至有绝食捐献的，或者为了捐献武器，担任了与自己的业务无关的过多过重的因而是不适当的社会劳动；有的工人捐出超过负担能力的工资；有的翻身农民捐出全部或大部斗争果实。应该指出：这些人的爱国热情是可嘉的，但是方法不适当。单纯采用这些方法，绝不能完成捐献武器的任务。
    大规模的捐献武器运动，已使抗美援朝运动走向高涨。现在的问题是要加强领导，想出更多的办法，使群众澎湃汹涌的爱国热情，真正贯彻到日常工作中，变成伟大无比的物质力量。为此，必须：
    第一、继续进行经常的、及时的时事政治教育。在抗美援朝运动中，人民群众普遍地受到了爱国教育，认清了美帝国主义的反动本质，增强了反抗美帝国主义的决心和信心。但是今后还必须经常地对群众进行爱国主义的政治教育，以进一步提高他们的政治认识，并及时地纠正某些人因朝鲜形势的新发展而发生的一些错误认识。有的人认为既然现在已进行朝鲜停战谈判了，因此就可以“不必捐献飞机大炮了”。这种认识是完全错误的，是会妨碍捐献运动的进行的。因此，应该结合具体事实，反复向群众说明：美帝国主义现在仍然侵占着我们的台湾，仍然在积极武装日本，仍然不打算彻底解决朝鲜问题，这一切都证明它并未放弃侵略中国和远东的政策。证明美帝国主义过去是今天仍然是我们的死敌。因此，只有建立强大的国防力量，才能保障我们国家的安全，保障国家的建设和人民幸福的生活。事实上，美帝国主义就在停战谈判期间，仍不时以飞机向我国领空侵扰。本月二十一日，敌机八架竟比过去更为深入地侵犯我国东北领空。但是，其中七架被我英勇的空军击落。这件事再一次证明了加强我们的国防力量，建立强大的空军、海军的极端重要性。我们只要随时向群众进行这样的生动、实际的时事政治教育，使群众清楚认识到加强国防力量的重要性，那么，群众是会自觉地积极地完成捐献飞机大炮的计划的。
    第二、更重要的，是贯彻增产捐献的原则，领导已经认捐的单位和个人，找出增产捐献的门路。增加生产是捐献运动的物质基础。这个原则见诸实行，对国家和个人都有好处。各地党政领导机关，应该推动工会、商联会、同业公会等组织，领导与帮助机关、车间、商号与个人，订出与本身业务相结合的增产捐献计划，并推动他们逐步实现。这种计划必须具体，应该包括增加生产的办法，捐献款项的来源，按期、按月缴纳的数字。这种具体计划，加上群众性的检查与监督，即可按期完成，不会落空。北京稻香春等商号，即经过劳资协商，确定了面向农村、业务大众化、薄利多销、节省开支的增产捐献计划。这种办法切实可行，应该推广。
    第三、为了切实完成捐献计划，应该使捐献计划和爱国公约结合起来，把增产捐献计划列为爱国公约的主要内容之一。各地在检查爱国公约的过程中，应该着重检查增产捐献计划的执行情况。帮助未订约的单位迅速订立，帮助已订约的单位，修改、充实公约内容。马恒昌小组修订了该组的爱国竞赛公约，争取半年内超额完成生产任务百分之十，捐献百分之五十的奖金和每月一天的工资，购买飞机大炮。这种把爱国公约、劳动竞赛和捐献计划结合起来的作法，各地都可采用。
    在广大群众爱国主义热情空前高涨的基础上，加以细致、深入的领导，我们相信，各地人民的增产捐献计划是可以圆满完成的。
