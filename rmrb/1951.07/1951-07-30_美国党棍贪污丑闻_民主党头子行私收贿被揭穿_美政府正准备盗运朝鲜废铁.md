　　Xinhua News Agency, July 29th: TASS, New York, July 28th, reports: The "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" revealed that Truman's party boss, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Boyle, is now accepting $500 in bribes monthly from the American Leesorfold Printing Company. This company pays him every two weeks as "reward" for helping the company obtain a $565,000 loan from the government Reconstruction Finance Corporation. Truman's other close friend, former Missouri Internal Revenue Bureau Director Finnigan, also received the same bribe. He received 100 shares of stock in Leesorfold Printing Company, plus a monthly bribe of $1,000.
　　According to the "St. Louis Post-Dispatch," Leesorfold Company applied three times to the government Reconstruction Finance Corporation for a loan of $465,000, and all three applications were rejected. Later, due to Boyle and Finnigan's intercession, the company actually received a loan of $565,000. Two weeks later, Leesorfold Company added Boyle and Finnigan's names to the company's payroll. The "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" also stated that the Reconstruction Finance Corporation's approval of the loan to Leesorfold Printing Company occurred in September 1949, four days after Truman celebrated Boyle's appointment as chairman of the Democratic National Committee at a banquet in Kansas City, Missouri.
　　According to Detroit newspapers, the House Subcommittee investigating illegal government contracts recently uncovered another case of corruption in Detroit. This activity involved Brigadier General Crawford, director of the Detroit Arsenal, and some of his assistants. Crawford admitted that he had accepted "gifts" from some companies under the guise of "hotel expenses." These companies obtained government orders totaling $33 million through him. Arsenal officials under him also accepted bribes totaling $200,000 from companies that received arms orders under the guise of "loans," "treats," and "sales commissions."
　　Xinhua News Agency, July 29th: TASS, New York, July 27th, reports citing "The New York Times": The US government's "General Services Administration" is preparing to send a government delegation to Korea next month to "investigate scrap iron on the battlefield that can be transported to the United States." The delegation will include representatives from various steel companies. Currently, preparations for dispatching the delegation are nearing completion.

    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十八日讯：美国“圣路易邮报”披露：杜鲁门的党老板，美国民主党全国委员会主席鲍埃尔现在每月接受美国李索福尔德印刷公司五百美元的贿赂。这个公司每两星期付款一次给他，作为感谢他帮助该公司获得政府复兴银公司五十六万五千美元的贷款的“酬劳”。杜鲁门的另一个密友，前密苏里州国内捐税局局长芬纳根也收到同样的贿赂。他得到了李索福尔德印刷公司一百股的股票，外加每月一千元的贿赂。
    据《圣路易邮报》说：李索福尔德公司曾三次申请政府复兴银公司贷款四十六万五千元，结果都遭到拒绝。后来，由于鲍埃尔和芬纳根两人出面说情，这个公司竟得到了五十六万五千元的贷款，两星期后，李索福尔德公司就把鲍埃尔与芬纳根的名字，列入了该公司的发薪簿。《圣路易邮报》并且说：复兴银公司批准贷款给李索福尔德印刷公司的这件事，就发生在一九四九年九月，杜鲁门在密苏里州堪萨斯城的宴会席上庆贺鲍埃尔就任民主党全国委员会主席后的第四天。
    另据底特律的报纸报道，最近，调查政府合同的非法行为的众院小组委员会，在底特律也发现了另一件贪污行为。这次的活动牵涉底特律兵工厂厂长克劳福准将和他的一些助手。克劳福承认，他在“旅馆费用”的名义下，接受过一些公司的“礼物”，这些公司通过他得到了总额达三千三百万美元的政府订货。他属下的兵工厂官员也在“贷款”、“请客”以及“销货佣金”等名义下，接受了那些得到军火订单的公司共二十万美元的贿赂。
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十七日电引《纽约时报》消息：美国政府的“总务管理处”筹备派遣一个政府代表团，于下月前往朝鲜，“调查可以运到美国去的战场上的废铁”。代表团将包括各炼钢公司的代表在内。目前，派遣该代表团的筹备工作即将完成。
