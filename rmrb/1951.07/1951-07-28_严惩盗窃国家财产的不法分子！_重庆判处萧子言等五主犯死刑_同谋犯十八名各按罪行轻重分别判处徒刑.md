Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 27th. The case of Xiao Ziyan and 24 other criminals, who were reported by the Southwest Branch of the Supreme People's Procuratorate for stealing huge amounts of national property in construction projects, has been concluded by the Chongqing People's Court. The five principal culprits, Xiao Ziyan, Pan Zhongping, Yang Jichang, Han Jixian, and Qin Yintong, were sentenced to death. Eighteen accomplices, including Cai Zufang and Gu Weiguo, were sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment ranging from one to fifteen years according to the severity of their crimes. An accessory, Jin Yanqing, was released after education. The bribe-takers among the above-mentioned criminals were ordered to hand over their ill-gotten gains; those who stole property were ordered to compensate the state for its losses and complete the unfinished projects, with their guarantors bearing joint and several liability.
　　The principal culprit in this case, Xiao Ziyan, was originally the head of the privately-owned Chongqing Jitai (later renamed Jihua) Architectural Firm. When Chongqing was first liberated, Xiao infiltrated the Barracks Management Section of the Logistics Department of our Southwest Military Region as an "engineer" and served as an engineering consultant. Subsequently, Xiao colluded secretly with unscrupulous contractors, successively squeezing out more than sixty private construction companies' repeated bids, monopolizing various construction projects of the department, and engaging in malfeasance. In June of last year, after the establishment of the state-owned Southwest Construction Company, Xiao again exploited loopholes to infiltrate the company as the deputy director of the design department. He then systematically colluded with several private construction factories, headed by the treacherous merchant Han Jixian, to send insiders to infiltrate our agencies, cooperating internally and externally, stealing large amounts of people's property, causing significant losses to the country's construction endeavors. According to the investigation, Xiao and others stole a total of 7,974,510,000 yuan of state property.
　　After the case was reported anonymously, the Southwest Branch of the Supreme People's Procuratorate immediately sent people to investigate and established close contact with relevant departments such as the state-owned Southwest Construction Company and the Barracks Management Section of the Logistics Department of the Southwest Military Region. After careful study, the case was solved on February 3rd of this year. Xiao Ziyan, the deputy director of the design department who infiltrated our Southwest Construction Company, and Xia Donghai, the deputy engineer; Zhao Jiwu, the engineering consultant who infiltrated our Barracks Management Section of the Logistics Department of the Southwest Military Region, and the engineer Yang Jichang; Han Jixian, the manager of the illegal contractor Dasha Construction Company; Qin Yintong, the manager of the New China Construction Factory; Cai Zufang, the manager of the Ningtai Construction Factory; Gu Weiguo, the manager of the Chunji Construction Factory, and 24 other criminals were all arrested. The Southwest Branch of the Supreme People's Procuratorate then, together with the state-owned Southwest Construction Company and the Barracks Management Section of the Logistics Department of the Southwest Military Region, established three investigation teams and one engineering inspection team to conduct detailed investigations and interrogations. After thoroughly investigating the case, the Chongqing People's Procuratorate filed a public prosecution with the Chongqing People's Court.
　　The main methods of the crimes committed by the criminals in this case were: (1) Transferring engineering designs. For example, the architectural design of the hospital of the Health Department of the Southwest Military Region was originally decided to be undertaken by the state-owned Southwest Construction Company. Xiao used the excuse of insufficient manpower to transfer it to the Jihua (formerly Jitai) Architectural Firm for design. There were more than ten similar incidents. This gave contractors an opportunity to take advantage of, enabling them to steal state property. (2) Overestimating construction prices. For example, the engineer Zhang Jiade of the state-owned Southwest Construction Company estimated the cost of the auditorium project of the Southwest Military and Political Committee to be 12 billion yuan. Xiao used his authority as the deputy director of the design department to arbitrarily change the estimate to 28 billion yuan, deliberately allowing contractors to obtain illegal profits in order to benefit from it. (3) Changing budgets and blueprints. For example, whenever the Southwest Military Region constructed a project, Yang Jichang and other criminals would first leak the confidential information such as the project address to the contractors. Then, they would draw and design based on the existing materials of the contractors and the materials that were easily available in the area in order to obtain substantial profits; otherwise, Yang and others would raise the budget or deliberately design incorrectly, leaving loopholes for malfeasance. (4) Skimping on materials and workmanship. In the projects undertaken by the contractors for the Southwest Military Region, except for the first one, the rest all skimped on materials and workmanship. For example, the stone foundation was supposed to be polished on three sides, but it was only polished on one side; new bricks were replaced with old bricks, blue bricks were replaced with red bricks, large pillars were replaced with small pillars, fair-faced brick walls were changed to stucco walls, cement was mixed with lime, the floorboards were planed one less time, and the paint was applied one less coat. There were many similar practices. (5) "Carrying the sedan chair." For example, four contractors, including Jingji Construction Factory (later joined by Laiji Construction Factory), conspired to form a cartel to exclude other construction factories, monopolize project contracting, take turns undertaking projects, and obtain illegal profits; Xiao and others shared the spoils. (6) Bribing cadres. For example, Qin Yintong, the manager of the New China Construction Factory, bribed Pan Zhongping and others, the deputy leaders of the design team of the Barracks Construction Section of the Logistics Department of the Artillery Command of the Southwest Military Region.
　　After this case occurred, the state-owned Southwest Construction Company and other units immediately conducted self-criticism. The Chongqing Municipal Finance and Trade Departments and people from the industrial and commercial sectors also widely organized discussions, unanimously demanding severe punishment for the masterminds such as Xiao Ziyan.
　　When sentencing the criminals in this case, the Chongqing People's Court accepted the recommendation of the Southwest Branch of the Supreme People's Procuratorate and issued a notice of commendation and material rewards to Zhang Jiade, Shen Shilun, Leng Yuhua and other engineers of the state-owned Southwest Construction Company who had made meritorious contributions in reporting the case.

　　严惩盗窃国家财产的不法分子！
　  重庆判处萧子言等五主犯死刑  　同谋犯十八名各按罪行轻重分别判处徒刑
    【新华社重庆二十七日电】最高人民检察署西南分署检举的萧子言等二十四名罪犯在建筑工程中窃取巨额国家财产案，已经重庆市人民法院审理终结并予判决。萧子言、潘仲平、杨继昌、韩季贤、秦隐桐等五名主犯判处死刑；蔡祖方、顾维国等十八名同谋犯，各按罪行轻重分别判处一年到十五年有期徒刑；从犯金延庆予以教育后释放。以上各犯，受贿者饬其交出赃款；窃取者饬其赔偿国家损失，完成未完工程，并要他们的保证人负连带责任。
    本案主犯萧子言，原是重庆市私营基泰（后改名基华）建筑事务所主持人。重庆刚解放时，萧犯以“工程师”身份混入我西南军区后勤部营房管理科任工程顾问。此后，萧犯即与不法包商暗中勾结，连续排挤六十余家私营建筑商的迭次投标，垄断该部各项建筑工程，从中舞弊。去年六月，国营西南建筑公司成立后，萧犯又钻空子混入该公司任设计部副主任，并有计划地与由奸商韩季贤为首的几家私营营造厂共同派遣内线，打入我机关，里应外合，大量窃取人民财产，使国家建设事业遭受重大损失。据检查结果，萧犯等共窃取国家财产达七十九亿七千四百五十一万元之巨。
    本案经人密告后，最高人民检察署西南分署立即派人进行侦查，并与国营西南建筑公司、西南军区后勤部营房管理科等有关部门取得密切联系，详加研究后，于本年二月三日破案；混入我西南建筑公司设计部任副主任的萧子言和副工程师夏东海、混入我西南军区后勤部营房管理科任工程顾问的赵济武和工程师杨继昌、不法包商大厦建筑公司经理韩季贤、新中华营造厂经理秦隐桐、宁泰营造厂经理蔡祖方、春记营造厂经理顾维国等二十四名罪犯全部被逮捕。最高人民检察署西南分署随即会同国营西南建筑公司、西南军区后勤部营房管理科成立了三个侦讯小组和一个工程检查小组，详细调查和侦讯，将案情全部调查清楚后，交由重庆市人民检察署向重庆市人民法院提起公诉。
    本案各犯犯罪的主要方法是：（一）推转工程设计。如西南军区卫生部医院建筑工程设计，原决定由国营西南建筑公司承做。萧犯借口力量不够，将其推转给基华（原名基泰）建筑事务所设计。类此事情，计十余起。这样就使包商有机可乘，得以从中窃取国家财产。（二）高估营造价格。如西南军政委员会礼堂工程，国营西南建筑公司张家德工程师估价为一百二十亿元。萧犯利用设计部副主任职权，竟擅将估价改为二百八十亿元，故意使包商获取非法利润，以便从中渔利。（三）改概算，改图样。如西南军区每兴建一工程，杨继昌等犯便将工程地址等机密先泄露给包商，然后根据包商现有材料及该地容易买到的材料来绘图设计，以获得厚利；否则，杨犯等便将概算改高，或故意设计错误，留下舞弊空隙。（四）偷工减料。包商承做的西南军区工程中，除第一件外，其余都偷工减料。如石基规定三面光，结果是一面光，新砖改用旧砖，青砖改用红砖，大柱改用小柱，清水墙改成混水墙，洋灰掺石灰，地板少刨一道，油漆少上一次。类此作法很多。（五）“抬轿子”。如静记营造厂等四家包商（以后又加入来记营造厂）阴谋组合，排挤其他营造厂，垄断工程承包，轮流承做，获取非法利润；萧犯等从中分取赃款。（六）贿赂干部。如新中华营造厂经理秦隐桐收买西南军区炮兵司令部后勤部营房建筑科设计组副组长潘仲平等。
    本案发生后，国营西南建筑公司等单位曾立即进行检讨；重庆市各财经、贸易部门及工商界人士等，也都广泛组织讨论，一致要求严惩萧子言等主谋犯。
    在判决本案各犯时，重庆市人民法院接受最高人民检察署西南分署的建议，对本案检举有功的国营西南建筑公司工程师张家德、沈士伦、冷玉华等皆予以通报表扬及物质奖励。
