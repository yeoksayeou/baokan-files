Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 1st: The Pyongyang City People's Comfort Group, composed of people from the capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, arrived at the front lines on the anniversary of the Korean People's Liberation War. After presenting a banner to the leading organs of the Chinese People's Volunteers as a sign of respect, the group went to various units of the Volunteers to offer their condolences and appreciation.

　　At the banner presentation ceremony, Kim Woo-sung, Vice Minister of Culture and Propaganda of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and head of the Comfort Group, delivered a message of greetings. He warmly congratulated the Chinese People's Volunteers on the great victories they have achieved in fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army, and expressed his heartfelt gratitude and respect to Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, and to all the Chinese people, as well as to all commanders and fighters of the Volunteers. Commander Kim Woo-sung gave a detailed account of how the Korean people, under the call of General Kim Il-sung to "mobilize everything for victory," were united in a heroic struggle to defeat the American aggressors. He said that in order to strengthen the power to strike at the enemy, the Korean people had donated 1.5 billion Korean won and a great deal of grain for the purchase of airplanes and tanks. He concluded by saying, "The noble blood shed by the beloved Chinese people on our country's soil will never be forgotten by our future generations. The heroic struggle of the Korean and Chinese people against a common enemy has received the support of peace-loving people all over the world, and final victory is destined to be ours."

　　Xu Guang-il, Deputy Secretary of the Pyongyang City Committee of the Korean Workers' Party and leader of the Third Team of the Comfort Group, said in his speech at the banner presentation: "With the fraternal support of peace-loving people all over the world, headed by the Soviet Union, and especially with the direct assistance of the great Chinese People's Volunteers, the Korean people will certainly be able to defeat the American aggressors and win the independence, freedom, and honor of our motherland. The people of Korea and China will unite more closely in the struggle against the common enemy and to defend world peace, and jointly create victorious achievements in the history of our two countries."

　　In his reply, the leader of the Volunteers expressed a warm welcome to the Comfort Group and deep gratitude for the love and condolences of the Korean people. He also warmly congratulated the comrades of the Comfort Group on their health and General Kim Il-sung on his health. The Volunteer leader pointed out that in the past year, the Korean people's just war against aggression has achieved great victories. Since last October alone, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have annihilated more than 240,000 enemy troops in coordinated operations. This great victory has laid the foundation for final victory and has put the American aggressors in a dilemma. The imperialists are also encountering serious difficulties within their own ranks as a result of the continuous setbacks of the war of aggression, and their internal contradictions are deepening day by day, as evidenced by the dismissal of MacArthur. The Volunteer leader went on to point out that the road to victory is still arduous, because we are fighting against the most powerful imperialist army in the world. However, based on the rich experience of the Chinese people in defeating enemies with superior equipment with inferior equipment, we can be sure that the Korean and Chinese people will gradually weaken the enemy and strengthen themselves in a long and arduous struggle, and achieve final victory. The Volunteer leader also pointed out that what determines the outcome of a war is manpower and morale. Korea and China have ample manpower, and the people of both countries have a strong fighting will against aggression and for freedom, which is the greatest strength. The Chinese people are vigorously launching a campaign to donate airplanes, tanks, and artillery, which will enable the people of Korea and China to achieve final victory sooner.

　　The Comfort Group is composed of 137 people, including working people, representatives from all walks of life, writers, journalists, and artists from Pyongyang City. Among them are 19 official representatives, and the comfort performance team consists of three art teams formed by the Korean National Art Theater, the Korean People's Army Concert Troupe, the Korean Central Mobile Art Team, the Korean Farmers' Troupe, and the Korean Government Industry Department Troupe.

　　The gifts brought by the Comfort Group included 22 silk banners, 8 sets of Korean national costumes, 263 boxes of Korean famous specialty ginseng, and a large number of daily necessities, as well as 2,259 letters of condolence from Pyongyang citizens and others.

　　平壤人民慰问团慰问中国志愿军
    【新华社朝鲜前线一日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国临时首都平壤市人民组成的慰问团，在朝鲜人民解放战争周年纪念日到达前线。该团在向中国人民志愿军领导机关献旗致敬后，即到志愿军各部队去进行慰问。
    慰问团团长朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府文化宣传省副相金午星在献旗典礼上致慰问词。他热烈祝贺中国人民志愿军在和朝鲜人民军并肩作战中所获得的伟大胜利，并向中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东主席和全中国人民，以及志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员，表示衷心的感激和敬意。金午星团长详细介绍了朝鲜人民在金日成将军的“一切为了胜利”的号召下，全民一致地为打败美国侵略军而英勇斗争的情形。他说：朝鲜人民为加强打击敌人的力量，已经捐献了朝鲜币十五亿元和许多粮食，以供购买飞机、坦克之用。他最后说：“亲爱的中国人民在我们祖国土地上所流的高贵的鲜血，是我们子孙万代永远不会忘记的。朝、中人民反对共同敌人的英勇斗争，得到了全世界爱好和平人民的支援，最后胜利是注定了属于我们的。”
    慰问团第三队队长朝鲜劳动党平壤市委员会副委员长许光日在献旗时致词说：“朝鲜人民在以苏联为首的全世界爱好和平的人民的兄弟般的支援下，特别是在伟大的中国人民志愿军的直接援助下，是一定能够打败美国侵略者，赢得我们祖国的独立自由和荣誉的。朝、中两国人民在反对共同敌人、保卫世界和平的斗争中，将更紧密地团结，共同创造两国历史上的胜利伟绩。”
    志愿军首长在致答词时，对慰问团表示热烈的欢迎，对朝鲜人民的热爱和慰问表示深切感谢。他并热烈祝贺慰问团同志们健康，祝贺金日成将军健康。志愿军首长指出：在过去一年中，朝鲜人民反侵略的正义战争，已经取得了伟大的胜利。仅仅从去年十月以来，朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军就在协同作战中歼灭了敌人二十四万多人。这个伟大胜利已经奠定了最后胜利的基础，使美国侵略者陷于进退维谷的境地。帝国主义内部也因为侵略战争的连续挫败而遇到严重的困难，其内部矛盾也日益加深，麦克阿瑟的被撤职就是一个最明显的例子。志愿军首长接着指出：到达胜利的道路还是艰苦的，因为我们是在和世界上最强大的帝国主义的军队作战。但是根据中国人民用劣势装备打败有优势装备的敌人的丰富斗争经验，可以确信：朝、中人民将在长期持久的艰苦斗争中，一步步地削弱敌人，壮大自己，取得最后胜利。志愿军首长并指出：决定战争胜负的是兵力和士气，朝鲜和中国有充裕的人力，两国人民又具有反侵略、争自由的坚强战斗意志，这是最伟大的力量。中国人民正在轰轰烈烈地展开捐献飞机、坦克、大炮运动，这将使朝、中人民提早取得最后的胜利。
    该慰问团由平壤市劳动人民、各界代表、作家、新闻记者及文艺工作者共计一百三十七人组成，其中正式代表十九人，随团参加慰问演出的有由朝鲜国立艺术剧场、朝鲜人民军协奏团、朝鲜中央移动艺术队、朝鲜农民剧团及朝鲜政府产业省剧团混合组成的三个艺术工作队。
    慰问团携带的礼品有锦旗二十二面，朝鲜民族服八套，朝鲜著名特产人参二百六十三盒及大批日用品，此外并有平壤市民等的慰问信二千二百五十九封。
