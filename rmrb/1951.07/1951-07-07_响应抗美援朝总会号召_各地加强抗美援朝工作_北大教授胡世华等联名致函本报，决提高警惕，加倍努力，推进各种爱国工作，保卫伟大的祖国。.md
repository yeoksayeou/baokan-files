　　Responding to the Call of the China Peace Committee
    Various Regions Strengthen the Resist-America, Aid-Korea Work
    Peking University Professor Hu Shihua and Others Jointly Write to This Newspaper, Resolving to Increase Vigilance, Redouble Efforts, Advance Various Patriotic Works, and Defend the Great Motherland.
    [Our Newspaper] The people of all circles in the capital warmly support the China Peace Committee's notice on the 4th, further expanding and deepening the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement. The people of all circles in Beijing recognize that although Ridgway has agreed to negotiate the Korean armistice, our Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement must not be relaxed; moreover, in order to facilitate the success of the armistice negotiations and to defend the great motherland and peace in the Far East, we should intensify the Resist-America, Aid-Korea work. Liu Dezhen's group, the national model worker of the Shijingshan Power Plant, has begun to review the patriotic pacts established in June in conjunction with the production increase and donation movement. All employees of the plant have also decided to universally review the patriotic pacts of the groups and the production increase and donation competition pacts of the workshops. Zhang Yihua's group, a rubber transport worker at the Beijing People's Printing Factory, guarantees no accidents in July, overfulfilling production tasks, and checking the patriotic pacts every week. Liang Zhencai, a intaglio printer, guarantees to donate all monthly bonuses to purchase planes and artillery to consolidate national defense. After heated discussions at a general meeting of Beijing's automotive industry, everyone gained a correct understanding of the armistice negotiations, and the patriotic donation figure increased by more than 20 million yuan compared to the original 250 million yuan. Daoxiangchun Food Store in Dong'an Market delivered 20 million yuan of patriotic donations six days ahead of schedule, which was originally scheduled for July 10th. Teachers and students of Northern Jiaotong University and Beijing Railway College have formulated plans for increasing production and donations, making the patriotic donation movement more planned, regular, and mass-based than before. The number of students from the school participating in military cadre schools has also exceeded the original quota. The members and group leaders of the Resist-America, Aid-Korea Committee of the Fifth Police Station in the Fifth District of Beijing have decided to immediately review and revise their own patriotic pacts, and then promote the review and establishment of patriotic pacts by all residents. They also guarantee to do a good job in patriotic donations and preferential treatment for family members of martyrs and military personnel.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 6th Dispatch] The people of all circles in Wuhan have decided to increase their donation of 15 fighter jets, bringing the total donation to 55 jets including the previous 40 jets. This donation goal was decided at the Wuhan Resist-America, Aid-Korea Representative Conference held on the 4th of this month. The representatives attending the meeting discussed the current situation of the Korean War and unanimously believed that the current armistice and even peace are not yet a reality, and the actual state is still war. Therefore, the movement to increase production and donations should not be relaxed in the slightest, but should be further strengthened to enrich the strength for striving for peace and defending peace.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 6th Dispatch] 591 representatives from Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles held a meeting on the morning of the 5th to discuss and formulate a specific plan to donate 270 aircraft. Sheng Pihua, Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, made a report at the meeting. He pointed out: The struggle of the Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world to resolutely defend world peace has forced the United States to accept Malik's proposal to peacefully end the Korean War. However, the outcome of the armistice negotiations depends on whether the United States has the sincerity to stop the Korean War. He said: Experience has proven that only a strong national defense force and a strong will of the people can win the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and protect the security of the motherland. Therefore, regardless of the outcome of the negotiations, we must complete the donation plan and strengthen the power of national defense to defend our motherland and lasting world peace. Hu Juewen, Chairman of the Supervisory Committee of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, also spoke at the meeting, calling on Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles to display a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm and strive to overfulfill the patriotic donation target with the greatest efforts. Sheng Pihua's and Hu Juewen's speeches were warmly supported by the representatives present. Following the meeting, representatives from the pharmaceutical, film, and cigarette industries reported on the specific plans for increasing production and donations in their respective industries. In the afternoon, group discussions were held by industry, and finally, the plans for increasing production and donations in each industry were established.
    [Our Newspaper] Peking University professor Hu Shihua and others wrote to this newspaper, expressing their opinions on the Korean armistice negotiations, believing that we must continue to strengthen the Resist-America and patriotic work and strike at the American aggressors. The original letter is as follows: Comrade Editor:
    After reading the news in the 2nd newspaper that Ridgway, commander of the US aggressor army, stated that he was willing to accept Malik's proposal and send representatives to negotiate an armistice with our representatives, we unanimously believe that this is another great victory for the Chinese and Korean People's Forces. For more than a year, the Chinese and Korean People's Forces have inflicted heavy blows on the United States and its vassal aggressor armies in Korea, causing it to be repeatedly defeated and putting it in a dilemma where it cannot take care of both ends. This has forced American imperialism to eagerly accept Malik's proposal and eagerly express its willingness to send representatives to negotiate an armistice. American imperialism is completely outwardly strong but inwardly weak, and the paper tiger has been completely exposed.
    However, we deeply recognize that American imperialism is inherently vicious and accustomed to deception. It will not accept the lessons of its tragic failure, and it will not completely let go of its aggression after being severely hit. On the contrary, it will never withdraw its policy of aggression before its final death, and it will definitely continue to act recklessly. In fact, American imperialism does not yet have the sincerity to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, has not stopped its occupation of our Taiwan, and has not stopped its conspiracy to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan. Even if the Korean War stops due to negotiations, American imperialism is still invading and harming our China and is still the deadly enemy of the Chinese people. We will never harbor the slightest illusion, and our Resist-America and patriotic work will never be relaxed. On the contrary, we should increase our vigilance, redouble our efforts, and use our greatest strength to promote various patriotic works, consolidate the national defense of our great motherland, and protect the security of our great motherland. The Chinese people will never allow American imperialism to carry out aggression wantonly, and we must continue to constantly strike at its acts of aggression, so that the aggressors cannot escape the fate of final death.

　　响应抗美援朝总会号召
    各地加强抗美援朝工作
    北大教授胡世华等联名致函本报，决提高警惕，加倍努力，推进各种爱国工作，保卫伟大的祖国。
    【本报讯】首都各界人民热烈拥护抗美援朝总会四日的通知，进一步扩大和深入抗美援朝运动。北京市各界人民都认识到：李奇微虽已同意谈判朝鲜停战问题，但我们的抗美援朝运动绝不能松懈；而且为了促成停战谈判的成功，为了保卫伟大祖国与远东和平，还应加紧进行抗美援朝工作，石景山发电厂全国劳动模范刘德珍小组已开始检查六月份结合增产捐献运动订立的爱国公约，全厂职工也决定普遍检查小组爱国公约和车间增产捐献竞赛公约。北京人民印刷厂胶运工人张意华小组保证七月份不发生事故，超额完成生产任务，每周检查爱国公约。凹印工人梁振才保证将每月所得奖金全部捐出来购买飞机大炮，巩固国防。北京市汽车业经过全体大会的热烈讨论，由于大家对停战谈判取得了正确认识，爱国捐献数字比原来的两亿五千万元增加了两千多万元。东安市场稻香春食品店提前六日交付了原计划在七月十日交付的爱国捐款两千万元。北方交通大学北京铁道学院师生订出了增产捐献计划，使爱国捐献运动比以前更为计划化、经常化和群众化。该校参加军事干部学校的学生也超过了原定名额。北京市第五区第五派出所抗美援朝委员会的委员及小组长决定即日起互相检查和修订他们自己订立的爱国公约，然后推动全体居民爱国公约的检查和订立。他们并保证做好爱国捐献工作和优待烈属、军属的工作。
    【新华社汉口六日电】武汉市各界人民决定增献战斗机十五架，连前捐献四十架共达五十五架。这个捐献目标是在本月四日举行的武汉市抗美援朝代表会议上决定的。到会代表讨论了目前朝鲜战争形势，一致认为目前停战乃至和平还不是现实，实际状态仍是战争，因此增产捐献运动不能有丝毫松懈，而应进一步加强，用以充实争取和平与保卫和平的力量。
    【新华社上海六日电】上海工商界代表五百九十一人于五日上午举行会议，讨论和制订了捐献二百七十架飞机的具体计划。上海市工商业联合会主任委员盛丕华在会上作了报告。他指出：中朝人民和全世界人民坚决保卫世界和平的斗争已迫使美国接受马立克关于和平结束朝鲜战争的建议。但停战谈判的结果如何，还要看美国有无停止朝鲜战争的诚意来决定。他说：经验证明，只有强大的国防力量和坚强的人民意志，才能争取朝鲜问题的和平解决和保卫祖国的安全。因此，不管谈判的结果如何，我们必须完成捐献计划，加强国防威力，以保卫我们祖国和世界的持久和平。上海市工商业联合会监察委员会主任委员胡厥文亦在会上讲话，号召上海工商界发挥高度的爱国热忱，以最大的努力来争取超额完成爱国捐献的目标。盛丕华和胡厥文的讲话，获得全场代表的热烈拥护。会议继由制药业、电影业和卷烟业等三个同业公会的代表，分别报告各该业所订增产捐献的具体计划。下午按行业进行小组讨论，最后订出了各行业的增产捐献计划。
    【本报讯】北京大学教授胡世华等致函本报，表示对朝鲜停战谈判的意见，认为我们必须继续加强抗美爱国工作，打击美国侵略者。原信如下：编辑同志：
    我们读到二日报纸刊登美国侵略军司令李奇微声明愿意接受马立克的建议，派遣代表和我们的代表谈判停战的消息以后，一致认为，这是中朝两国人民部队再一次的伟大胜利。中朝两国人民部队，在一年以来，已在朝鲜给美国及其附庸各国侵略军以沉重的打击，使它屡战屡败，使它今天到了进退两难，首尾不得兼顾的地步。这就迫使美国帝国主义急于接受马立克的建议，急于表示愿意派遣代表谈判停战。美国帝国主义完全是外强中干的，纸老虎完全被揭穿了。
    但是，我们深切认识，美国帝国主义是凶恶成性、惯于欺骗的。它不会接受其悲惨失败的教训，不会在受沉重的打击之后立即完全撒手不干其侵略的勾当。相反的，它在最后死亡之前绝不收回它的侵略政策，一定还要继续蛮干下去。事实上，美国帝国主义现在还没有和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意，还没有停止它对我国台湾的侵占，也还没有停止单独对日媾和的阴谋活动。即使朝鲜战事因谈判而停止，美国帝国主义仍然在侵略和危害我们中国，仍然是我们中国人民的死敌。我们绝不存着丝毫幻想，我们的抗美爱国工作绝不松懈。相反的，我们应该更提高警惕，更加倍努力，用最大的力量推进各种爱国工作，巩固我们伟大祖国的国防，保卫我们伟大祖国的安全。我们中国人民绝不让美国帝国主义肆行侵略，一定要继续不断地给它的侵略行为以打击，使侵略者逃避不了最后死亡的命运。
