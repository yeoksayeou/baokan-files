Based on the "Decision on the Policy Regarding the Handling of Cultural, Educational, and Relief Organizations and Religious Groups Receiving American Subsidies" from the 65th Government Administration Council meeting on December 29, 1950, and the principle in Vice Premier Guo's report approved at the same meeting that "Chinese religious organizations receiving American subsidies should be transformed into organizations completely self-managed by Chinese Christians, and the government should encourage their self-reliance, self-support, and self-propagation movement," the following measures are hereby stipulated for handling Christian organizations receiving American subsidies:

    I. All Chinese Christian churches and organizations should immediately sever relations with American missionary societies and other non-American missionary societies largely supported by American funds. The aforementioned missionary societies in China should cease their activities immediately.

    II. American personnel working in Chinese Christian churches and organizations should be handled according to the following principles:
    (1) Those with words and deeds opposing the People's Government should be removed from their positions, and those who have committed crimes should be reported to the government for punishment according to law.
    (2) Those who voluntarily wish to leave will be allowed to return to their country.
    (3) Those without reactionary words or deeds whom the church and organization deem necessary to retain and are willing to provide for their livelihood may continue to stay, but may not hold administrative positions in the church and organization.

    III. Social service undertakings such as medical and welfare institutions, originally run by Christian churches and organizations that have already achieved self-support, may continue to operate if their expenses can be self-sufficient, but a board of directors must be organized to ensure the implementation of government laws and regulations. The list of board members shall be subject to government approval. Those whose expenses cannot be maintained may apply for government subsidies or take-over. However, all primary and secondary schools (except religious schools) run by churches and church organizations should be separated from the church. The school buildings should, in principle, be assigned to the school. If the buildings are jointly used by the church and organization, the local People's Government shall formulate separate handling measures based on specific circumstances.

    IV. If foreign missionary societies voluntarily donate their assets in China (excluding land) to Chinese Christian churches and organizations, the Chinese Christian churches and organizations may accept all or part of them after government review and approval, but such donations must not be subject to any conditions.

    V. For Christian churches and Young Men's and Women's Christian Associations that have already achieved self-support, the government may exempt them from real estate tax for the buildings directly used by their churches and offices.

    VI. For properties rented out by Chinese Christian churches and organizations, the lease rights should be protected in accordance with government laws and regulations, and taxes should be paid to the government. Church buildings borrowed by the government shall be handled through consultation based on the local actual situation and the needs of the church, and contracts may be signed if necessary.

    VII. Christian churches and organizations that have already achieved autonomy, self-propagation, and self-support, if their funds belonging to the church and organization were stored abroad before December 29, 1950, and need to be repatriated, must provide accurate and detailed evidence explaining the source and purpose of the funds and submit it to the government for review and approval. If there is any deception, false reporting, or falsification of evidence, the person in charge and relevant personnel shall bear legal responsibility.

    VIII. All churches and their affiliated enterprises that have received foreign subsidies shall conduct special registration in accordance with the "Registration Regulations for Cultural, Educational, and Relief Organizations and Religious Groups Receiving Foreign Subsidies and Foreign Capital" of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government and shall not delay or resist under any pretext; the special registration should be cancelled for those who have indeed achieved self-support.

　　对于接受美国津贴的基督教团体处理办法
　  （一九五一年七月二十四日政务院公布）
    根据本院一九五零年十二月二十九日第六十五次政务会议《关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育救济机关及宗教团体的方针的决定》和同次会议批准的郭副总理报告中《接受美国津贴之中国宗教团体，应使之改变为中国教徒完全自办的团体，政府对于他们的自立自养自传运动应予以鼓励》之原则，兹规定对于接受美国津贴的基督教团体处理办法如下：
    一、中国各基督教教会及团体，应与美国差会及大部分由美国经费支持之其他非美国的差会，立即断绝关系。在中国之上述差会应即停止活动。
    二、在中国基督教教会及团体中工作之美国人员，应按下列原则处理：
    （一）有反人民政府言行者应予撤职，其犯有罪行者，报请政府依法惩办；
    （二）自愿离开者准其返国；
    （三）无反动言行而教会及团体认为有需要留下并愿供给其生活者，可以续留，但不得担任教会及团体的行政职务。
    三、已经实行自养之基督教教会和团体原来所办之社会服务事业如医疗机关、福利机关等，其经费能自给者，可继续办理，但须组织董事会，保证实行政府法令。董事会名单应由政府批准。其经费不能维持者，得申请政府补助或接办。但教会及教会团体所办大中小学校（除宗教学校外），均应与教会分开，学校使用之房屋，原则上应划归学校；如其房屋系与教会及团体共同使用者，由当地人民政府，依据具体情况，另订处理办法。
    四、外国差会如自愿将其在中国的财产（不包括土地）捐赠给中国基督教教会及团体，经政府审核批准后，中国基督教教会及团体得接受其全部或一部，但此项捐赠不得附有任何条件。
    五、已经实行自养之中国基督教教会及男女青年会，其教堂及办公处所直接使用之房屋的房地产税，政府可予免征。
    六、中国基督教教会及团体出租之房产，应按照政府法令，保障租赁权，并向政府纳税。凡由政府借用之教堂房屋，可视当地实际状况和对教堂的需要情况，协商处理，必要时得订立合同。
    七、已经实行自治、自传、自养之基督教教会及团体，在一九五零年十二月二十九日以前，其本教会及团体所有之经费如存储国外而需提回者，须提供确切详细证据，说明来源及用途，呈请政府审核批准。如有欺瞒、谎报、假造证据等情，其负责人及有关人均应负法律上之责任。
    八、凡曾接受外国津贴的教会及其附属事业，均应按照中央人民政府政务院《接受外国津贴及外资经营之文化教育救济机关及宗教团体登记条例》进行专门登记，不得借故拖延或抗拒；其已确实实现自养者，该项专门登记应予注销。
