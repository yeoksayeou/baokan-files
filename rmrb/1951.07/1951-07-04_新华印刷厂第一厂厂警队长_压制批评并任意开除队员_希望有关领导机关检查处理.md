　　The Factory Security Captain of the First Xinhua Printing Plant
    Suppresses Criticism and Arbitrarily Dismisses Team Members
    We Hope Relevant Leading Organs Will Investigate and Handle This.

Comrade Editor:

    I am a security team member of the First Xinhua Printing Plant (Beilishi Road, outside Fuchengmen), and because I reported to the People's Daily that the team leader Wang Qifu had kicked team member Yang Zikai, I was dismissed by the factory under the pretext that I was too old (I am thirty-three years old) to be a security guard. I believe that the style of Wang Qifu, the factory security team leader of the Xinhua Printing Plant, is not upright, and the treatment of Yang Zikai and me is unfair. I am now raising this matter, hoping that the relevant authorities will investigate and deal with it. The course of events is as follows:

    Security team member Yang Zikai fell asleep at his post during a night shift due to excessively long working hours. When team leader Wang Qifu discovered this, he pointed his pistol at Yang Zikai and then kicked him with his foot. Because he was wearing leather shoes, Yang Zikai's lower back was injured, and then Yang Zikai was locked in a detention room. Yang Zikai became ill as a result of such intimidation and beatings. The team leader did not think of providing treatment for Yang Zikai. I reported this matter to the People's Daily. I thought: The People's Daily is the people's newspaper, and the people can tell their newspaper anything. Unexpectedly, factory security team leader Wang Qifu and instructor Wang Liange, upon learning of this matter, immediately held a general meeting of all team members to "struggle" against me, saying that I was "reporting problems beyond my level and committing a top-level mistake." They also said that I was "attacking cadres and disintegrating the troops," and forced me to admit my mistake. After the "struggle session," the team leader and instructor called me to go to the People's Hospital to check whether Yang Zikai had been beaten. The intention was that if no injury was found, I would be punished. At the hospital, Yang Zikai's chest and bones were X-rayed and found to be uninjured; the doctor asked Yang Zikai to get out of bed, and only then was the injury to his lower back discovered. Wang Qifu insisted that the hospital issue a certificate stating that there was no injury to the bones or flesh. Because there was an injury, the hospital did not issue a certificate.

    When I returned to the factory, the person in charge of the factory's security section said that I would be assigned to another job and introduced me to the factory's personnel section. The comrades in the personnel section said that my age was over thirty and I could not do security work, and asked if it was okay to transfer me to another job. I replied, "I am willing to do any revolutionary work and will absolutely obey the transfer." However, later, the personnel section said that I had "made a mistake" and was "too old," took away my clothes, and dismissed me. When I was introduced by the Fourth Section of the Public Security Bureau to work as a security team member in the factory, I filled out a form stating that I was thirty-three years old, and the factory did not say that I was too old; moreover, because of my good work, I was promoted to squad leader. Now, to say that I am too old and dismiss me is clearly retaliation and a blow against me. If it is stipulated that people over thirty years old are not needed, why is team leader Wang Qifu, who is thirty-two years old, not dismissed? Saying that I am too old is not a reason. In addition to hoping that Comrade Wang Qifu will improve his leadership style, I propose that the factory security team should reinstate me in my job.

                                                      Lü Yongshun

### 新华印刷厂第一厂厂警队长  压制批评并任意开除队员   希望有关领导机关检查处理

　　新华印刷厂第一厂厂警队长
    压制批评并任意开除队员
    希望有关领导机关检查处理编辑同志：
    我是北京新华印刷厂第一厂（阜城门外北礼士路）厂警队员，因为向人民日报反映了队长王起富踢伤队员杨子楷的事情，被厂内借口年岁大（我三十三岁）不能作警卫员把我开除。我认为新华印刷厂厂警队队长王起富的作风不正派，对杨子楷和我的处理，不公平，现在提出来，希望有关机关检查处理。这件事情的经过是这样的：
    厂警队员杨子楷因工作时间过长，在夜里站岗时，在岗位上睡着了。队长王起富发觉后，拿起手枪对准着杨子楷，接着就用脚踢他。因为穿的是皮鞋，所以把杨子楷后腰部踢伤，后把杨子楷关到禁闭室里。杨子楷因受他这样的威吓踢打而得了病。队长也不想法给杨子楷治疗。我把这件事情报告给人民日报。我想：人民日报，是人民的报纸，人民有什么话，都可以告诉自己的报纸。谁料想厂警队长王起富、指导员王连阁，知道了这件事，立即开全体队员大会“斗争”我，说我是“越级反映问题，犯了顶大错误”。并说我是“打击干部，瓦解部队”，强迫我承认错误。“斗争会”开过后，队长和指导员又叫我一同去人民医院检查杨子楷是否被打伤。其意图是如验不出伤，就处罚我。到了医院，用爱克斯光透视杨子楷的胸部和骨内无伤；医生让杨子楷从床上起来，才发现后腰部的伤。王起富硬让医院开证明说骨肉无伤。因为有伤，医院没有开证明信。
    我回到厂里，厂的保卫科负责人说，另分配我工作，把我介绍到厂内人事科。人事科的同志说：我的年岁已过了三十，不能作警卫工作，问给我调换别的工作行不行？我回答说：“凡是革命工作，我都愿意作，绝对服从调动。”但是后来，人事科却说我“犯了错误”及“年岁大”，把我的衣服扒去，把我开除了。当我由公安局第四处介绍到厂内做警卫队员时，曾经填过表，报的是三十三岁，厂方并没有说年岁大；而且因工作好，又升为班长。现在又说年龄大，把我开除，显然是对我加以报复和打击。如果规定过三十岁的人不要，但队长王起富三十二岁，为什么不开除？说我年龄大，并不是理由。除了希望王起富同志改进领导作风之外，我提出该厂厂警队应恢复我的工作。
