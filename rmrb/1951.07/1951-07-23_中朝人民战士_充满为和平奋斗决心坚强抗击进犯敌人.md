Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 22nd: This reporter reports: After the start of the Korean armistice negotiations, the reporter went to inspect the front-line positions near Jimingli, thirty kilometers northeast of Kaesong. The Korean and Chinese People's fighters guarding the trenches have been resisting the invading enemy here for more than forty days and nights. In recent days, the invading troops of the United States, Britain, Canada, and others have launched fierce attacks one after another, but these attacks have also been relentlessly repelled by the Korean and Chinese People's fighters.

　　Enemy planes dropped bombs from the low-hanging clouds to destroy peaceful Korean villages. On the afternoon of July 12, a volunteer soldier named Zhou Chaoming came down from the position. As soon as he entered a mountain village, four enemy planes suddenly flew over and dropped four gasoline bombs. The mountain village immediately burst into flames. At this moment, Zhou Chaoming heard someone wailing in the smoke and fire. He rushed in regardless of everything and finally rescued an old Korean mother and two children. After Zhou Chaoming returned to the position, he angrily said to his comrades, "The American representatives have already gone to Kaesong to conduct peace talks, but they are still bombing Korean villages and killing peaceful people every day. Is this the sincerity of the Americans in the peace talks!?"

　　The Korean and Chinese People's fighters on the front-line positions all have a strong will to fight for peace. At the entrances of many fortifications, the fighters used green grass and wild lilies to build slogans such as "Resist America, Aid Korea for Peace, Defend the Country and Protect the Home for Tranquility." On the walls of the trenches, there were "Battlefield Express" curtains made of silk from captured enemy parachutes, which were filled with the fighters' merit plans for fighting for peace. A soldier named Li Chengzhou, who had killed twelve American soldiers, wrote on his merit plan: "Heads can be cut off, blood can flow, world peace must be fought for!" These heroic fighters read new books, newspapers, and pictorials sent from the motherland whenever they had a break. The news that the people of the motherland enthusiastically donated airplanes, artillery, and tanks greatly encouraged every fighter. The soldiers on the front line all believe: "Peace must be fought for with strength. We have more airplanes and tanks donated by the people of the motherland, and peace will be more secure."

　  充满为和平奋斗决心坚强抗击进犯敌人
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十二日电】本社记者报道：朝鲜停战谈判开始后，记者曾赴开城东北三十公里的鸡鸣里附近的前线阵地巡视。守卫在战壕中的朝、中人民战士们，在这里抗击进犯的敌人已经有四十多昼夜了。最近几天来，美、英、加等侵略军更连续发动了猛烈的进攻，但是这些进攻也同样被朝、中人民战士们无情地击退了。
    敌人的飞机从低沉的云雾中投下炸弹来毁灭朝鲜的和平村庄。七月十二日下午，有一个名叫周朝明的志愿军战士从阵地上走下来。他刚走进一个山村，忽然有四架敌机飞来，投下四颗汽油燃烧弹。这个山村立刻发生大火。这时周朝明听到在烟火中有人在嚎哭。他便不顾一切地冲进去，终于把一个朝鲜老妈妈和两个孩子抢救了出来。周朝明回到阵地上以后，愤怒地对他的战友们说：“美国的代表已经到开城去进行和平谈判了，但是他们每天还在炸毁朝鲜的村庄，杀害和平的人民。这就是美国人和谈的诚意吗！？”
    在前线阵地上的朝、中人民战士们都有着为和平而奋斗的坚强意志。在许多工事的进口处，战士们用青草和野百合花砌成了“抗美援朝为和平，卫国保家为安宁”的标语。在战壕壁上，挂着用缴获敌人降落伞的绸子做成的“战地快报”幕，上面贴满了战士们为和平而奋斗的立功计划。有一个曾打死过十二个美国兵的战士李成周在立功计划上写道：“头可断，血可流，世界和平势必争！”这些英勇的战士们一有空隙就阅读着从祖国送来的新书报和画刊。祖国人民热烈捐献飞机、大炮、坦克的消息，大大地鼓舞了每个战士。前线的战士们都相信：“和平是要用力量去争取的，我们有祖国人民捐献的更多的飞机、坦克，和平就会更有把握。”
