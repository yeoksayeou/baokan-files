　　Pay Attention to Guarding State Secrets!
  (I) Editor:
    I have two suggestions regarding the issue of guarding state secrets.
    First, when contacting people for work matters by telephone, the caller must first ask for the other party's telephone number and the name of their organization to avoid making mistakes. Often, people make a phone call and start talking about work without asking who the other party is. If the phone call is made to the wrong person, it will leak state secrets. The person answering the phone can first tell the other party their phone number and then ask where they are calling from; if it matches, then discuss work matters. Matters involving state secrets should never be discussed on the phone, because if the phone lines are crossed, a third party will hear everything.
    Second, when ordinary people go to bathhouses, according to custom, they "deposit" their money and important items for safekeeping. I have seen many cadres "deposit" their briefcases or guns for safekeeping, which is very bad. I believe that one should never carry such items to such places, and it is even more inappropriate to discuss work matters in public places.

        (II) Editor:
    Guarding state secrets is the responsibility and political task of all the people, especially revolutionary cadres. However, there are still a few staff members who do not pay enough attention to this. For example, on July 8th, when I went to the bathhouse, I heard two cadres talking about the contents of a recent central meeting and other matters related to state secrets. I believe that this kind of liberalism will cause losses to the country and should be resolutely opposed.
    In addition, many departments in our organization have not yet studied the "Provisional Regulations on Guarding State Secrets" promulgated by the Government Administration Council and the People's Daily editorial of June 11th, "Struggle to Guard State Secrets." This also shows that they do not pay enough attention to the work of guarding state secrets.
    Therefore, I suggest that all organizations should attach importance to the work of guarding state secrets, earnestly educate cadres, make them fully aware of the importance of guarding state secrets, consciously abide by the secrecy system, and develop a habit of maintaining secrecy.

### 注意保守国家机密！

　　注意保守国家机密！
  （一）编辑同志：
    我对保守国家机密问题有两点建议。
    第一，在用电话联系工作时，叫电话的人一定要先问清对方电话号码及机关名称，以免发生错误。常常有人叫通电话，不问对方是谁，开口就谈工作；如果电话叫错了，就会泄露国家机密。接电话的人可先将自己的电话号码告诉对方，然后问他要什么地方；如果相符，再谈工作。有关国家机密的问题，决不要在电话上谈，因为假使电话“串线”，就会让第三者全部听去。
    第二，一般人到澡堂洗澡，按照习惯，都把钱财及重要物品“交柜”保存。我曾看到不少干部竟把公事包或枪枝也“交柜”保存，这是很不好的。我认为到这种场所时绝不应携带以上物品，至于到公共场所谈工作问题，那就更不应该了。

        （二）编辑同志：
    保守国家机密是全国人民，特别是革命干部的责任和政治任务。但是，还有少数工作人员对此仍不够重视。如七月八日，我到澡塘洗澡时，听到有两个干部在聊天时谈起中央最近召开某会议的内容等有关国家机密的事情。我认为，这种自由主义的行为会造成国家的损失，是应该坚决反对的。
    此外，我们机关不少部门，到现在为止，对政务院公布的“保守国家机密暂行条例”及六月十一日人民日报社论“为保守国家机密而斗争”还没有进行学习。这也说明了他们对保守国家机密的工作是不够重视的。
    因此，我建议各机关应重视保守国家机密的工作，认真对干部进行教育，使他们充分认识保守国家机密的重要性，自觉地遵守保密制度，养成保密习惯。
