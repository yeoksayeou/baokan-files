　　(II) Why Are Many Patriotic Pledges Nominal?
　　Currently, many regions and units across the country are inspecting and revising their patriotic pledges. The results of these inspections have demonstrated the great role that establishing patriotic pledges plays in consolidating the achievements of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and in promoting production, work, and study. At the same time, it has also been discovered that many patriotic pledges established by units in the past were nominal and merely existed in form. The reasons why many patriotic pledges are nominal should not be sought elsewhere, but rather from the leadership's thinking and leadership style. Some leading organs and working cadres have failed to recognize, or have inadequately recognized, the role of patriotic pledges in organizing and educating the masses, and have therefore adopted a perfunctory attitude towards the patriotic pledge movement. This is a major reason why patriotic pledges become nominal. Another major reason why patriotic pledges become nominal is the style of commandism and monopolization by certain working cadres and activists who are divorced from the masses. Precisely because of these reasons, leading cadres and activists in many regions and units do not take seriously the task of publicizing the significance and methods of establishing patriotic pledges, nor do they deeply mobilize the masses to establish patriotic pledges. In those places, patriotic pledges are hastily drafted by a small number of working cadres and activists, or copied from newspapers or elsewhere. Since these patriotic pledges have not undergone serious discussion by the masses, and since they are not established consciously and voluntarily by the masses, they are naturally not pledges of the masses themselves, and are therefore merely nominal.
　　Therefore, in order to make the promotion of patriotic pledges a mass movement, it is necessary to thoroughly examine the ideological style of working cadres and activists in this inspection movement, so that they can all recognize the great significance of establishing patriotic pledges and master the method of following the mass line. Secondly, it is necessary to go a step further and fully mobilize the masses to examine the patriotic pledges in connection with their own thoughts, and to use the patriotic pledges as a yardstick to launch criticism and self-criticism. By doing so, not only can the broad masses be educated, but also the working cadres and activists. However, some places are now experiencing formalism and detachment from the masses when inspecting the patriotic pledges. For example, when the industrial and commercial circles of Kaifeng City, Henan Province, inspected their patriotic pledges, the work of the Federation of Industry and Commerce was merely to issue a form for inspecting the patriotic pledges. Many industries did not convene industry conferences or group leader meetings to actually conduct the inspection, but instead, the chairman or secretary of the trade association simply filled in the items on the form. It is obvious that using such a method to inspect patriotic pledges will not have any effect on further promoting the development of the patriotic pledge movement.

### （二）许多爱国公约为什么有名无实？

　　（二）许多爱国公约为什么有名无实？
    目前，全国许多地区和单位正在检查和修订爱国公约。检查的结果证明了订立爱国公约的办法对于巩固抗美援朝运动成果、推动生产、工作和学习，有伟大作用；同时也发现了过去许多单位所订立的爱国公约是有名无实、徒具形式的东西。许多爱国公约所以有名无实，不能从旁的地方去找原因，而必须从领导思想及领导作风上去找原因。有些领导机关和工作干部对于爱国公约的组织群众和教育群众的作用没有认识或认识不足，因而对于爱国公约运动采取了敷衍态度，这是使爱国公约有名无实的一个主要原因。使爱国公约有名无实的另一个主要原因，就是某些工作干部和积极分子的脱离群众的强迫命令、包办代替的作风。正是由于这些，许多地区和许多单位的领导干部和积极分子便不去郑重其事地宣传订立爱国公约的意义和方法，不去深入地发动群众来订立爱国公约。在那些地方，爱国公约是少数工作干部和积极分子草率拟定或者是从报纸上或别处抄来的。这些爱国公约既然没有经过人民群众的认真讨论，既然不是人民群众自觉自愿并认真来订立的，它们当然就不是群众自己的公约，当然就是有名无实的东西了。
    因此，为着使推行爱国公约成为群众运动，在这次检查爱国公约的运动中，必须深入地检查工作干部和积极分子的思想作风，使他们都能够认识订立爱国公约的伟大意义，都能够掌握走群众路线的方法。其次，必须再进一步，充分发动群众联系他们自己的思想，来检查爱国公约，以爱国公约为尺度，展开批评和自我批评。这样做，不但可以教育广大群众，而且也可以教育工作干部和积极分子。但是现在有些地方，在检查爱国公约时，也发生了形式主义、脱离群众的现象，例如，河南开封市工商界在检查爱国公约时，工商联的工作只是印发了一个检查爱国公约的表格，许多行业都没有召开行业大会或组长会议来实际进行检查，而只是由同业公会主任委员或书记按表格的项目随便填了一下。用这样的办法来检查爱国公约，对于进一步推动爱国公约运动的发展，当然是不会有什么作用的。
