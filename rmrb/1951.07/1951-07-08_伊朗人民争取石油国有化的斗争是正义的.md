　　The Iranian People's Struggle for the Nationalization of Oil is Just
    Saifuddin
    The Iranian people are waging a heroic struggle for their country's independence, sovereignty, and the nationalization of oil. We extend our infinite sympathy to the Iranian people's just struggle.

    The Iranian people's demand for oil nationalization is entirely reasonable, just, and absolutely necessary for achieving national independence. British imperialism, through the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, has long manipulated Iran's economy and politics, which is a major root cause of the extreme poverty of the Iranian people. In the past few decades, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company has extracted at least four to five billion US dollars in wealth from Iran. Iranian oil workers working for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company suffer inhuman treatment, working twelve to sixteen hours a day, while their wages are only one to three tomans (Iranian currency), barely enough to sustain a semi-starved life. There are now more than one million unemployed workers in Iran. These are the disasters that British imperialism's economic plunder has brought to the Iranian people. The Iranian people certainly cannot silently endure this situation; they resolutely oppose the cruel colonial policy that British imperialism implements in Iran. The Iranian people's struggle against British plunder and for oil nationalization surged in March of this year. It was precisely due to the demands of the broad masses that the Iranian parliament and government passed the law to implement oil nationalization at the end of April.

    After the Iranian parliament passed the oil nationalization law, British imperialism, in order to maintain its aggressive interests in Iran, used all kinds of despicable and shameless means of intimidation and bribery against the Iranian people and government, even threatening to use armed intervention to suppress the Iranian people's just actions. The US government, on the one hand, openly helped the British government threaten and bribe the Iranian government to abandon the oil nationalization law, and on the other hand, secretly attempted to take the opportunity to expand US control over Iranian oil. These shameless acts of interference by Anglo-American imperialism have once again exposed their heinous and aggressive faces before the Iranian people and the people of the world. The Iranian people have not been intimidated by the threats of imperialism; on the contrary, they have responded to the imperialist offensive with resolute actions of demonstrations by tens of thousands of people and large-scale strikes. After a period of hesitation and wavering, the Iranian government, finally under the urging of the broad masses, decided on June 20 to immediately implement the oil nationalization law and announced the dissolution of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.

    However, Anglo-American imperialism has not yet abandoned its conspiracy of interference, and they are still plotting to sabotage Iran's oil nationalization measures. British Foreign Secretary Morrison, in the British House of Commons on June 21, spoke publicly in a threatening tone about "possible military action" against Iran. US Secretary of State Acheson also issued a statement in Washington on June 27, calling on the Iranian government to "reconsider its current actions." These facts show that imperialism will never be reconciled to letting the Iranian people smoothly implement their oil nationalization law. Therefore, in order to thoroughly achieve the goal of oil nationalization, the Iranian people still need to make serious efforts. We believe that the Iranian people will unite as one, be vigilant against the conspiracies and tricks of the imperialists and the danger of halfway abandonment by the compromisers, and persist in the patriotic struggle to the end.

    The Iranian people's struggle has won the support of all progressive people in the world. The sympathy of all the people of Asia and the vast oppressed Muslims is on the side of the Iranian people. Now the aggressive policy of US and British imperialism has encountered a heroic counterattack in Korea, and the struggle of the people of the world for peace and democracy is constantly rising. The international situation is favorable to the Iranian people's struggle for their country's independence and oil nationalization. We, the Chinese people, the vast number of Muslims in China, fully support the just struggle of the Iranian people, oppose the unreasonable interference of imperialism, and believe that the Iranian people have every right to solve their own country's vital internal affairs.

　　伊朗人民争取石油国有化的斗争是正义的
    赛福鼎
    伊朗人民正在为争取自己国家的独立主权和石油国有化而进行英勇的斗争。我们对伊朗人民的这一正义斗争寄予无限的同情。
    伊朗人民的石油国有化的要求是完全合理的，正义的，是为实现国家独立所绝对需要的。英帝国主义在长期间利用英伊石油公司操纵着伊朗的经济和政治，这是伊朗人民极端贫困的一个主要根源。在过去几十年中，英伊石油公司至少已从伊朗榨取了四、五十亿美元的财富。在英伊石油公司做工的伊朗的石油工人遭受着非人的待遇，他们每天工作十二小时至十六小时，而所得的工资却只一个到三个土曼（伊币），还不够维持半饥半饱的生活。伊朗的失业工人现在已有一百万多人。这些就是英帝国主义的经济掠夺所带给伊朗人民的灾难。伊朗人民当然不能对这种情形无言地忍受下去，他们坚决反对英帝国主义在伊朗所实行的这种残酷的殖民政策。伊朗人民反对英国掠夺政策及争取石油国有化的斗争，在今年三月间高涨了起来。正是由于广大人民的要求，伊朗国会和政府才在四月底通过了实施石油国有化的法案。
    在伊朗国会通过了石油国有化法案以后，英帝国主义为了保持它在伊朗的侵略利益，对伊朗人民和政府施用了各种各样的卑鄙无耻的威吓利诱手段，甚至威胁要以武装干涉来压服伊朗人民的正义行动。美国政府一方面公开帮助英国政府威胁和利诱伊朗政府，要它放弃石油国有化法案，一方面又暗中企图乘机扩张美国对伊朗石油的控制。英美帝国主义的这些无耻的干涉行动，又一次在伊朗人民和全世界人民面前暴露了它们的穷凶极恶的侵略面貌。伊朗人民并没有被帝国主义的威胁所吓倒，相反地，他们以成千成万人的示威和大规模罢工的坚决行动回击了帝国主义的进攻。伊朗政府经过一度的动摇犹豫后，终于在广大人民的督促下在六月二十日决定立即实施石油国有化法案，并宣布了解散英伊石油公司。
    但英美帝国主义现在仍未放弃其干涉阴谋，它们仍在继续策划破坏伊朗石油国有化的措施。英国外交大臣莫里逊于六月二十一日在英国下院曾公开以威胁口吻谈到对伊朗“可能采取的军事行动”，美国务卿艾奇逊也于六月二十七日在华盛顿发表声明，要伊朗政府“重新考虑它目前的行动”。这些事实表明帝国主义是决不甘心让伊朗人民顺利实施他们的石油国有化法案的。因此，伊朗人民为了彻底达到石油国有化的目标，还需要经过一番严重的努力。我们相信，伊朗人民将团结一致，警惕帝国主义者的阴谋诡计和妥协主义者的半途而废的危险，把爱国的斗争坚持到底。
    伊朗人民的斗争已经获得全世界一切进步人民的支持。全亚洲人民和广大的被压迫的伊斯兰教徒的同情，都在伊朗人民这方面。现在美英帝国主义的侵略政策已在朝鲜遭到英勇的反击，全世界人民争取和平与民主的斗争正在不断高涨。国际形势对于伊朗人民争取自己国家独立和石油国有化的斗争是有利的。我们中国人民，中国的广大的伊斯兰教徒，完全支持伊朗人民的正义斗争，反对帝国主义的无理干涉，认为伊朗人民有充分权利解决他们自己国家的生命攸关的内政问题。
