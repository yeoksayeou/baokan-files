    Trade Union Leads Workers to Improve Production
    Successfully Completing the Increased Production Donation Plan
    The Manufacturing Department Trade Union of Chongqing Sichuan Cement Plant, focusing on the main problems in current production, led workers to improve work and successfully realized the increased production donation plan. After the department set a plan at the beginning of June to increase daily cement production by five tons, it completed 240% of the plan in the first ten days. On June 18th, it even created a record of producing 26.99 tons more than the highest record since the kiln was opened.
    Before June, the main problems in the department's production were: insufficient contact between departments and an unsound production responsibility system. For example, the technicians in the laboratory who test slurry mostly looked down on the kiln firemen. They rarely accepted the opinions of the kiln firemen, who based their opinions on practical experience, when preparing the slurry, thus affecting the improvement of the kiln output. In addition, the cement packaging machine in the department often had accidents due to the lack of a dedicated person in charge, but it was never clear who should be responsible. At the beginning of this month, when the department's workers were brewing increased production donations, the workshop trade union, at the joint meeting of all production team leaders and trade union group leaders, proposed that all departments should strengthen ties and improve the production responsibility system, focusing on the above-mentioned main problems. After the team leaders' joint meeting, the workers in each group proposed specific measures to strengthen contact and strictly divide responsibilities in the discussion, and added this issue to the patriotic pact. Therefore, within ten days after the start of the department's increased production donation campaign, the contact between the groups was greatly strengthened. For example, the kiln firemen have promptly reflected the good and bad conditions of the slurry burning in the kiln to the laboratory, and the laboratory technicians have immediately changed the test components when the kiln firemen reported that the slurry was not burning well. The coal loading group used to have poor contact with the kiln firemen, making it difficult for the kiln firemen to grasp the size of the fire. Now they have fully accepted the kiln firemen's opinions on how much coal should be supplied per hour. Accidents caused by the negligence of individual workers can now be promptly checked after the establishment of a dedicated responsibility system and inspection system, preventing and reducing the occurrence of accidents.

    工会领导工人改进生产
    顺利完成增产捐献计划
    重庆四川水泥厂制造所工会针对当前生产中的主要问题，领导工人改进工作，顺利实现增产捐献计划。该所六月初订出每日增产水泥五吨的计划后，最初十天就完成计划百分之二百四十，六月十八日更创造了多产二十六点九九吨的开窑以来的最高纪录。
    六月份以前，该所生产上存在的主要问题是：各部门的联系不够密切，生产责任制不健全。例如化验室化验料浆的技工大多看不起旋窑看火工人，在配制料浆时很少接受看火工人从实际经验中提出的意见，因而影响旋窑产量的提高。又如该所水泥包装机因无专人保管，常常发生事故，但也清查不出到底该由谁负责。本月初该所工人在酝酿增产捐献中，车间工会即在全所生产组长、工会小组长的联席会议上，针对上述主要问题，提出各部门应加强联系和健全生产责任制的努力方向。小组长联席会议后，各组工人在讨论中更提出了加强联系、严格分工负责的具体办法，并将这一问题增订到爱国公约里。因此，该所增产捐献运动开始后的十天内，各组的联系即大为加强。如看火工人已做到及时向化验室反映料浆在窑内燃烧时的好坏情形，化验室技工也做到在看火工人提出料浆不好烧时，即刻改变化验成分。加煤组工人过去和旋窑看火工人联系也很差，使看火工人不易掌握火力大小，现已做到完全接受看火工人关于每小时下煤多少的意见。因个别工人疏忽而发生的事故，在建立专责制和检查制后，也已能及时检查出来，防止与减少了事故的发生。
