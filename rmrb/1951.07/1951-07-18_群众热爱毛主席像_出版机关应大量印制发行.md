The Masses Love Chairman Mao's Portrait: Publishing Houses Should Print and Distribute Them in Large Quantities

To the Editor:
    We, the people of Yingshang County, like all the people of China, wholeheartedly love our great leader Chairman Mao. For example, during the Spring Festival this year, when Gengpeng Township in Gengpeng District held a township women's congress, old women said on the way, "Hurry to the township government, there is a portrait of Chairman Mao there. Let's pay our respects to him." When they arrived at the township government, the old women respectfully saluted Chairman Mao. Old woman Chen, who is over seventy years old, said, "After returning home, I will sell some grain and buy a portrait of Chairman Mao." After the meeting, everyone was reluctant to leave and wanted to take a few more glances at Chairman Mao before leaving. For example, during the May Day parade this year, the masses in Huangmiao Township, Xihe District, were delighted to see the large portrait of Chairman Mao and said, "Chairman Mao is here!"
    These facts show the people's love for Chairman Mao. They all hope to have a portrait of Chairman Mao hanging in their homes. However, in the countryside of our county, there are very few portraits of Chairman Mao, and the price is very expensive. We suggest that publishing houses quickly print large quantities of exquisite portraits of Chairman Mao, pay attention to distributing them to rural areas, and sell them to the masses at low prices.

　　群众热爱毛主席像
    出版机关应大量印制发行编辑同志：
    我们颍上县人民，正和全中国人民一样，衷心地热爱着中国人民伟大领袖毛主席。如今年春节时，耿棚区耿棚乡召开全乡妇女会，老大娘在路上就说：“赶快到乡政府去，那里有毛主席的像。咱们给他老人家拜年去。”到了乡政府，老大娘们就恭恭敬敬地向毛主席行礼。七十多岁的陈老大娘说：“回家后卖点粮食，一定要买张毛主席像。”会开完后，大家都不愿走，要多看毛主席几眼再走。又如在今年“五一”大游行时，西河区皇庙乡群众看到毛主席的大像，都高兴地说：“毛主席来啦！”
    这些事实，说明了群众对毛主席的热爱。他们都希望能有一张毛主席像挂在自己家里。可是在我县乡间，毛主席像很少，卖的价钱又很贵。我们建议出版机关迅速大量精印毛主席像，注意向农村发行，低价卖给群众。
