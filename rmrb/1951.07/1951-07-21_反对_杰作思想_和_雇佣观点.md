Editor's Note: What attitude should engineering and technical personnel adopt towards national construction projects? What should be the fundamental differences between engineering and technical personnel in the new China and those in the old society? Li Yizhi from Tangshan and Chen Jiahong from Wuhan have both expressed their opinions on this issue. Today, our newspaper publishes an article by three architects from Beijing, Dai Nianci and others, hoping that engineering and technical circles nationwide will enthusiastically participate in this discussion.

The People's Daily has successively disclosed many facts about "construction is impossible without correct design." These facts have greatly warned us architects and engineers who bear technical responsibility in basic construction. They have made us more highly aware of the seriousness of "incorrect design," and aware that even if we wholeheartedly want to do things for the people, a single error in thought can lead to a great disaster, causing irreparable damage to the people. However, this error in thought is not accidental. It has its specific roots. These are some of the bad ideological consciousnesses left over from the old society in our minds. Therefore, in this movement called for by the People's Daily, it would be very beneficial to dig up the old roots in our thinking.

We believe there are two main ideological roots:

The first we call "Masterpiece Thinking." People with this kind of thinking do not regard the engineering tasks in their hands as the people's construction cause; instead, they regard them as masterpieces to show their own abilities and express their "unique theories." I remember when our teacher taught us "Architectural Business and Laws" in the past, he told us: "An architect's design pattern is his personal work. He is responsible for the work and enjoys copyright. Therefore, during the project, the architect is the highest authority who decides all technical issues. Only in this way can the architect's design be brought into full play and the house built to perfection." (The general idea is like this)

Due to the existence and development of this type of thinking, some people in design work often demand that all objective conditions cater to him and satisfy his intentions. Therefore, in order to show the mystery of his structural algorithm and that he can do things that others dare not do, he will ignore the actual use and insist on his risky design. If he studied in a certain country, he would feel that everything in that country is advanced. If you don't accept his opinion, he will say that you are technologically backward. He will also think that the construction work is like the printing work in the publishing industry: printers cannot arbitrarily change articles, so construction workers are only allowed to construct according to the drawings without any deviation. Taking ourselves as an example, in the past, the construction factories in the old society were accustomed to being submissive to us. In today's work, sometimes when construction comrades raise difficult situations and request changes to the design, we will have the feeling that "you always emphasize objective reasons and are unwilling to overcome difficulties."

This type of thinking appears a lot in our own work. Some comrades, in order to feel that adding an auditorium to his design can be more "artistic," hopes that the client will build an extra auditorium. For the need for a few horizontal lines on the wall, he doesn't ask whether it is actually needed and puts bookshelves all over the wall in the hall. Some comrades who just came from the South last year designed a crushed brick and lime soil footing for a certain project. When the construction comrades told him that the northern workers couldn't do the crushed brick and lime soil, and that general northern buildings use lime soil footings, his attitude was not to enthusiastically and proactively study the performance of lime soil, but to say, "If you want to change to lime soil footings, you are responsible for signing off." Last year, there was also a project where the comrade in charge of the architectural design did not accept the advice of the structural work comrade, disregarded the current lack of technical conditions, and insisted on making exposed brick railings on the cantilevered balcony. As a result, the balcony cracked and the project was damaged. Although this damage is not considered large, we say that it and the erroneous design of the Laowangpo flood storage project in Henan, which damaged more than 30,000 acres of farmland, published in the People's Daily on July 13th, stem from the same ideological root. If we do not eliminate this kind of thinking, then equally serious errors are very likely to appear in our own work in the future.

We believe that people with this "masterpiece" thinking do not wholeheartedly serve the people, but serve their own "masterpiece."

The second type of thinking we call it "Hired Hand Viewpoint." People with this view often regard their work merely as a means of earning a living. Or, even if they don't see it as a means of earning a living, they hold a passive attitude of "anyway, I have done my best in my own work, and I can't manage anything else." This attitude is just like the familiar joke that says: "Someone got shot with an arrow, and he asked a surgeon to treat it. The doctor sawed off the arrow tail exposed outside and said that his responsibility had been fulfilled, and the arrowhead in the flesh was the business of the internist."

Due to this irresponsible thinking, we often do not investigate, research, or grasp comprehensive materials in design work, and when things go wrong, we blame it on objective reasons. For example, the Trade Union Guesthouse we designed inquired about the building line of the base from the Construction Bureau at the beginning of the design. At that time, the comrade who designed the project suspected that the width of Ligelao Hutong was too small, but he proceeded with the design according to the instructions of the Construction Bureau without any in-depth investigation. Half a year later, when the entire design was completed and an official permit was requested from the Construction Bureau, the official notice from the Construction Bureau was received, stating that the hutong should be widened and the house should be set back another five meters. As a result, it had to be redesigned, delaying the start date by one and a half months. We initially thought that this was entirely the fault of the Construction Bureau. But later we realized that our designers should bear greater responsibility. We did not investigate in depth beforehand; after half a year, as usual, we should have requested instructions from the Construction Bureau again when carrying out the formal construction drawings; but we did not do so. We only pushed the responsibility to the Construction Bureau in front of the client.

Secondly, due to this "hired hand viewpoint," we often only seek to complete the task in design work, and do not consider the overall interests of the project. For example, in a machine room of the Telecommunications Bureau that we designed, the groundwater level in that area was very high. In the middle of the design, the comrade in charge of the design leadership found that the boiler room was designed underground, and felt that it was not appropriate at the time. However, after asking, the architectural drawings and the structural calculations for that part were almost completed. Thinking that the client was urging urgently, and thinking that the boiler room being underground was also beneficial to the heating device; so I was sloppy, anyway, I just wanted to get the drawings out as soon as possible. As a result, when the construction encountered the rainy season, the earthworks collapsed everywhere, and the project was extended by three months, which was much longer than the time it would have taken to change the design at the beginning. And it cost the people about 500,000 kilograms of millet more.

Again, the "hired hand viewpoint" often makes us accommodate the client without principle in our work. And if the client is a layman, (the vast majority of clients are laymen in terms of technology) then it is easy to make mistakes. The People's Daily has revealed many such facts in recent days. A certain cadre school we designed this year also made the same mistake.

When the school was initially designed, because there was not much funding, we suggested that the client build the houses in a less important area. The reason is that due to limited funding, the current housing standards cannot be built very well. And in the future, as the state's finances improve and funding is sufficient, the standards that everyone demands will also increase. At that time, these better houses can be added in a suitable location. However, they did not accept this suggestion. They made a general layout design and arranged the buildings one by one according to their ideal formation. Except for the office building, all were bungalows. A huge base was arranged to be full. And they said that this was decided at their meeting. We felt that this arrangement was not good at the time. And it was also pointed out that this arrangement was not in line with the local terrain, and the earthwork project was very large during construction. But he said that they had a lot of labor, and if they sent a troop, they would solve the earthwork at once. In this way, we carried out the design work according to his opinion. Most of the design was completed, and most of the bungalows were built. Their leaders began to think that this way of building was not right. A large area of bungalows were arranged like trains. So it was proposed that the office building to be built must be built into a three-story building, and at the same time, it should be changed to a flat roof. (The original design was three stories in the middle and two stories on both sides, with a tiled roof.) We were asked to redesign it. We said: It is excusable for you to build one more floor because the house is not enough. If you build one more floor for the sake of appearance, then why spend more money and extend the construction time? He said: This was decided by their leader. Now they have money. It doesn't matter if the construction time is extended. We also told him that changing to a reinforced concrete flat roof would not only cost more money, but we would have to redo the structural design, and the construction time would be extended even longer. And the tiled roof can also be made to look good. He said that this was also decided by the leader and must be changed. So we redesigned it. The construction time was extended by three months. And due to the rework in the design, we completed 5,000 square meters less design work this year.

However, from the point of view of our designers, the main loss is not here. The problem is that the hasty decision of the entire general layout is the biggest mistake. First, this layout has no room for expansion. If additional students are added in the future and buildings need to be added, the bungalows that are currently built will inevitably be demolished. Otherwise, another site for expansion will have to be found. Second, due to the excessive spread of the base and the excessive distance from east to west and north to south, management will be more difficult in the future. Third, the decentralized layout increases the engineering of roads and ditches, and if buildings are built in a centralized manner, the roads and ditches can be saved by more than half. Fourth, this kind of decentralized bungalow is the most unsuitable for installing heating. If all the school buildings need to be equipped with heating in the future, it will suffer considerable difficulties and waste.

We designers feel that this is a mistake. But we always believe that our mistake was only being the tail of the client, and the main reason was that the client did not accept our opinions, so he should bear greater responsibility. Until recently, we realized that the greater responsibility lies not with the client but with ourselves. Although we put forward opinions, we did not put them forward sufficiently, and we did not take a firm stand to fight against incorrect opinions. This shows that we have not been responsible for the people's cause to the end.

Basic construction is an arduous task. The comrades who lead us often warn us, saying: "Construction workers are the vanguard of the new democratic construction cause. Any construction must first build houses. If we do not work hard, then the construction that was originally to be completed in ten years will be extended to fifteen or twenty years because of our poor work." Recently, from the People's Daily, we have further realized that the "correct design" required by the new society is so much higher than what was required by the old society that it cannot be calculated. What a great responsibility we designers have to bear!

### 反对“杰作思想”和“雇佣观点”

　　反对“杰作思想”和“雇佣观点”
    正建筑师　戴念慈　副建筑师  王坤祐  副建筑师  严星华
    编者按：工程技术人员对于国家的各项建设工程应当采取什么样的态度呢？新中国工程技术人员和旧社会工程技术人员应该有什么原则上的区别呢？唐山李一之同志和武汉市陈家珖同志均对这一个问题发表了意见，今天本报又发表北京戴念慈等三位建筑师的文章，希望全国工程技术界热烈参加这个讨论。
    人民日报接连披露了关于“没有正确设计就不可能施工”的许多事实。这些事实大大地警告了我们在基本建设中担负技术责任的建筑师们和工程师们。使我们更高度地认识到“非正确设计”的严重性，认识到虽然我们满心想替人民做事，可是只要一念之差，就反而会作下大孽，使人民受到不可弥补的损害。然而，这一念之差并不是偶然的。它有它一定的根源。那就是旧社会在我们脑子里存留下来的一些不良的思想意识。因此，在人民日报所号召展开的这个运动中，来挖一挖我们思想上的旧根子，应该是很有好处的。
    我们以为主要的思想根源有两种：
    第一种我们叫它“杰作思想”。有这种思想的人，把他手里的工程任务不看作是人民的建设事业；而看作是显示他自己的本领，表现他“一家之说”的杰作。记得过去我们的老师给我们讲授“建筑师业务及法令”的时候，就告诉我们说：“建筑师的设计图案，是他个人的作品。他对作品负责，并且享有著作权。因此在工程进行中，建筑师是决定一切技术问题的最高权威。唯有如此，才能发挥建筑师的意匠，使房子造得尽善尽美。”（大意如此）
    由于这类思想的存在和发展，有些人在设计工作中，便往往要求一切客观条件来迁就他，满足他的意图。于是，为了表现他的结构算法的奥妙，表现别人所不敢做的东西他能做得了，他就会不顾实际用途，而坚持他的冒险设计。如果他是某一国留学的，他就会觉得一切都是那一国进步。你们不接受他的意见，他就说你们技术落后。他又会认为工程的施工工作好比在出版事业中的印刷工作：印刷工作者不能乱改文章，因此施工工作者也只允许分毫不差地照图施工。拿我们自己来说，过去旧社会里的营造厂对我们唯唯诺诺惯了，在今天的工作中，有时施工同志提出困难情形而要求更改设计时，心里就会产生“你们老强调客观原因，而不愿克服困难”的感觉。
    这一类思想，在我们自己的工作中，是出现得很多的。有的同志为了觉得他的图案中加一个礼堂可以更“艺术”一些，他于是希望委托建筑者多造一个礼堂。为了墙壁上需要来几条横的线条，他就不问事实上需要与否，在门厅里做上满墙壁的书架。也有的同志去年刚从南方来，把某工程设计了碎砖三合土的底脚。当施工同志告诉他北方工人做不来碎砖三合土，一般北方的楼房都采用灰土底脚时，他的态度不是热诚地主动地去研究灰土的性能，而是说“你们要改灰土底脚，由你们签字负责”。去年还有一个工程，负责建筑设计的同志因不接受结构工作同志的劝告，不顾目前技术条件的不足，在挑出的阳台上坚持做清水砖砌的栏杆，结果阳台裂缝了，工程受了损害。虽然这个损害不算大，但是我们说它和人民日报七月十三日登载的，河南老王坡蓄洪工程灾害田地三万多亩的错误设计，是出于同一种思想根源的。如果我们不把这种思想清除，那么同样严重的错误，是很有可能在今后工作中，出现于我们自己手下的。
    我们认为具有这种“杰作”思想的人，他并没有全心全意为人民服务，而是为他自己的“杰作”服务。
    第二种思想我们叫它“雇佣观点”。有这种观点的人，往往把他的工作仅仅看作是饭碗。或者，即使并不看作饭碗，也抱着“反正我自己份内的工作已经尽心尽力，此外我根本管不着”的消极态度。这种态度，正好比我们所熟知的笑话，说：“有人身上中了一箭，他请外科医生治疗，那医生把露在外面的箭尾锯掉了，说他的责任已尽，那肉里的箭头是内科医生的事情。”
    由于这种不负责任的思想，使我们在设计工作中往往不调查，不研究，不掌握全面的材料，而事情坏了却推说是客观的原因。例如我们所设计的总工会招待所，在设计之初向建设局了解了基地的建筑线。当时设计的同志虽曾怀疑李阁老胡同宽度太小，可是毫不深究地仍旧依照建设局的指示进行设计。事隔半年，等到全部设计完成，向建设局正式请照的时候，才收到建设局的正式通知，说要放宽胡同，该屋应再退后五公尺。于是不得不重新设计，使开工日期延误了一个半月之久。我们最初认为这完全是建设局不好。可是后来认识到，我们设计人是应负较大的责任的。事前既不深究；事后隔了半年，照例应该在进行正式施工图的时候，再度向建设局请示的；可是我们并没有这样做。仅仅在委托设计者面前把责任向建设局一推完事。
    其次，由于这种“雇佣观点”，也常使我们在设计工作时只求完成任务，而不从工程的全面利益来考虑问题。例如我们所设计的电讯局某机器房，该地的地下水位很高。设计中途，负设计领导责任的同志，发现锅炉房设计在地面以下，当时感到并不合适。可是一问建筑图样和该部分结构计算都已经快要完成了，再一想委托者又催得紧急，又一想锅炉房在地面以下对于暖气装置还有些好处；于是马马虎虎，反正早点把图样搞出去就算了。结果呢，施工的时候碰上雨季，到处坍塌土方，工程因此延长了三个月，比当初更改设计所要花费的时间长得多。而且因此多花了人民小米约五十万斤。
    再次，“雇佣观点”又常常使我们在工作中无原则地迁就委托者。而如果委托者是个外行的话，（绝大多数委托者对技术是外行的）那就很容易发生毛病了。人民日报连日揭露的这类事实已经很多。我们今年所设计的某干部学校，也发生了同样的错误。
    该校在最初设计的时候，因为经费不多，我们曾建议委托者把房子集中造在一个比较不重要的地区里。理由是限于经费，目前的房屋标准不能造得很好。而将来添建的房屋，随着国家财政的好转，经费充裕了，大家要求的标准也提高了，那时就可以把这些较好的房屋，添建在适中的地位上。然而他们并没有接受这个建议。他们搞了一个总平面的设计，依照他们理想中的阵势，把一幢一幢房屋都排定了。除了办公楼以外，一概都是平房。把偌大一块基地，排得满满的。并且说这是他们开会决定的。我们当时曾感到这样的布置方式不好。并且还提出这个排法不合当地地形，施工中土方工程很大。但他说他们有的是劳动力，开一个部队来，一下就把土方解决了。这样，我们于是依照他的意见，进行了设计工作。大部分设计完成了，大部分平房盖好了，他们的首长开始认为这样造法不对，一大片平房，排得像火车一样。于是提出那即将开工的办公大楼必需造成三层楼房，同时改为平屋面才好。（原设计是中间三层，两翼二层，瓦屋面。）要求我们重做设计。我们说：你为房子不够而多盖一层，还可说得过去。如果为了好看而多盖一层，那又何必多花钱，多延长工程时间呢？他说：这是他们首长决定的。现在他们有钱了。延长工程时间也不要紧。我们又告诉他，更改为钢骨水泥平屋面不但多花钱，而且我们得重新做结构设计，工程时间将要延得更长。而且瓦屋面也一样可以做得好看的。他说这也是首长决定的，非改不可。我们于是重新做了设计。工程的时间延长了三个月。并且由于设计上的翻工，使我们今年少完成五千平方米的设计任务。
    然而，从我们设计人的观点看来，主要损失还不在这里。问题是那整个总平面布置的草率决定，就是最大的失策。第一，这个布置是没有扩充余地的。如果将来增加学员而要添建楼房时，势必把现在造好的平房拆掉。不然就得另找扩充的地盘。第二，由于基地铺展过大，东西南北距离过远，将来在管理上会增加困难。第三，分散的平面形式，增加了道路沟管的工程，如果集中起来造楼房的话，那么道路沟管可以节省一半以上。第四，这种分散的平房是最不宜于装置暖气的。假如将来全部校舍需要装设暖气的时候，就会遭受相当困难和浪费。
    我们设计人感觉到这是一个错误。但始终认为我们的错误只是做了委托者的尾巴，而主要是委托者不接受我们的意见，因此他应负较大的责任。直到最近我们才认识到，较大的责任不在委托者而在我们自己。我们虽然提出意见，但提得并不充分，更没有站定立场，向不正确的意见作斗争。这就是表示对人民事业并没有负责到底。
    基本建设是一个艰巨的工作。领导我们的同志经常警惕我们，说：“建筑工作者是新民主主义建设事业中的先锋队。任何建设都首先要造房子。如果我们不努力，那么本来十年完成的建设，就会因为我们工作不好而延长到十五年二十年。”最近从人民日报上，更认识到新社会所要求的“正确的设计”，和旧社会所要求的，是高到不能以道里计算的。我们设计工作者所要担负的责任，是何等重大！
