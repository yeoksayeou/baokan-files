Some Cadres Treat Cotton Purchase and Storage as a Purely Economic Task
    The Cotton Selling and Storage Campaign in Northern Jiangsu Has Not Yet Taken Shape

The cotton purchase and storage work in various parts of northern Jiangsu was assigned relatively late, only being deployed to the villages in the latter part of June, becoming an action, and achieving some results. However, until around July 10th, a widespread mass patriotic cotton selling and storage campaign had not yet been launched. Moreover, many areas have not been well-organized. Except for areas with cooperatives, where the work has generally been better, other areas have been sporadic and listless, and the masses have not sold large amounts of their stored cotton to the state.

The reasons for this situation, according to preliminary research, are mainly due to the insufficient understanding of the political significance of this work by the leading organs of counties and districts. They have not followed the spirit of the central government's instructions to deploy cotton purchase and storage as a campaign, but have only regarded it as a simple economic task of purchasing and storing. Many cadres believe that cotton purchase and storage is not like grain requisition. The government has already stipulated purchase and storage methods, adjusted cotton prices, and adopted a policy of "listening to rises but not falls" during cotton storage. Cotton farmers will not suffer losses whether they sell or store cotton, so there is no reason why they would be unwilling to sell. Therefore, various regions simply deployed this task at a series of meetings, lacking detailed research on specific methods and steps in the work. Although counties have established cotton purchase and storage committees, most of them are empty shells with no one specifically in charge.

Since the leading organs treat cotton purchase and storage as a simple acquisition task, they have failed to concentrate the manpower of various departments and have not paid attention to mutual coordination. Various departments only emphasize their own heavy tasks and do not regard cotton purchase and storage as their own responsibility. For example, the cooperative departments in many counties mainly focus on their own marketing and ordering of autumn cotton, placing the current intensive cotton purchase and storage work in a secondary position. The tax departments in Dongtai, Sheyang, and other counties simply emphasize fiscal revenue, even collecting commercial tax from cotton farmers who already have self-sale permits.

Generally, district and township cadres do not treat this task as a central task, and do not conduct investigations and research on the cotton storage situation among the masses. Therefore, no one can be sure whether this task can be completed, and the work is not energetic. Some cadres even store cotton at home without selling it. Some even complain that the leading organs are "making trouble out of nothing," saying, "Why do we need to mobilize people to buy cotton with money?"

On the part of the masses, many ideological concerns cannot be dispelled because they have not received in-depth propaganda and education on cotton selling and storage. Some fear that their family status will be raised due to revealing wealth, some fear that the progressive rate of agricultural tax will be increased in the autumn, some fear that they will not get loans, some fear that cotton prices will rise further, and some fear that selling cotton now will cause resentment from others because they refused to lend cotton in the spring. These thoughts seriously hinder the development of the campaign. Coupled with the lack of active leadership by cadres, it further fuels their wait-and-see attitude.

In order to change this situation, the district should immediately reverse the cadres' erroneous understanding of the cotton selling and storage campaign, unify and mobilize the forces of various departments. First, the thinking of cadres and party members must be straightened out, sufficient manpower should be drawn out, and full propaganda and education work should be carried out to rural party members and the masses, mobilizing party members to promote the development of the cotton selling and storage campaign with their own exemplary actions. In various systems, cadres must be made aware of the serious political significance of cotton purchase and storage, and various tasks should be appropriately arranged, distinguishing between priorities and urgency, and carrying them out in combination, so that cotton purchase and storage work is not squeezed out by other work.

### 有些干部把购棉储棉当成单纯经济任务  苏北售棉储棉尚未形成运动

　　有些干部把购棉储棉当成单纯经济任务
    苏北售棉储棉尚未形成运动
    苏北各地的购棉、储棉工作下达较晚，一直到六月下旬的后段才布置到乡村，成为行动，收到一些成绩。但直到七月十日左右，普遍的群众性的爱国售棉、储棉运动还未展开。而且有不少地区还没有很好地布置。除有合作社的地方大部做得较好外，其他地区一直呈现着零零落落、有气无力的状态，群众存棉未能大量售给国家。
    工作陷于这样局面的原因，据初步研究，主要由于各地县、区领导机关对这一工作的政治意义认识不足，没有遵照中央指示的精神把购棉储棉作为一个运动来布置，而只是把它当作一个简单的收购与储存的经济任务看待。许多干部认为：购棉、储棉又不是征花，政府已经规定了购、储办法，在棉价上做了调整，储棉时又“听涨不听落”，棉农卖花储花都不吃亏，没有什么原因不愿意卖。因此各地只是在一揽子的会议上把这一任务简单地布置了一下，对具体工作中的方法步骤缺乏细致的研究。各县虽然成立了购棉储棉委员会，但并无专人负责，多数成为空架子。
    领导机关既把购棉、储棉当作简单的收购任务，所以就未能集中使用各部门的干部力量，也没有注意互相配合。各部门只是强调自己的任务繁重，不把购棉储棉任务看做自己的事。如不少县份的合作部门，即是以本部门的包销和定购秋后棉花为主，将目前突击性的购棉储棉工作反而放在次要地位。东台、射阳等县的税务部门则单纯强调财政收入，棉农售花已有自销证的，也要征收行商税。
    一般区、乡干部因为没有把这一任务当做中心任务，对群众存棉情况也不作调查研究，因此对这一任务能否完成，谁也不能肯定，工作也不起劲。有的干部自己家里存着棉花，也不拿出来。有的甚至埋怨领导机关“没事找事”，说：“用钱买棉花为什么还要动员？”
    群众方面，因未受到有关售棉、储棉的深入的宣传教育，许多思想上的顾虑不能解除。他们有的怕因露富而提高家庭成份，有的怕秋后提高农业税的累进率，有的怕得不到贷款，有的怕棉价还要上涨，有的因春天拒绝了别人借棉的要求，怕现在卖了花引起别人怀恨。这些思想，严重地阻碍着运动的开展。再加上干部不积极带头，更助长了他们的观望情绪。
    为了转变此种局面，该区应该立即扭转干部中对售棉储棉运动的错误认识，将各部门的力量统一领导起来，动员起来。首先打通干部党员的思想，抽出足够的干部力量，向农村党员和群众进行充分的宣传教育工作，发动党员以自己的模范行动，推动售棉、储棉运动的开展。在各系统中都要使干部认识到购棉储棉的严重政治意义，并适当安排各种工作，分清轻重缓急，结合进行，使购棉储棉工作不被其他工作挤掉。
