    Hebei Province, Wen'an County, First District

    Inspects and Revises Patriotic Pact, Promotes Experience, Corrects Deviations

    The First District of Wen'an County, Hebei Province, recently conducted a focused and in-depth inspection of the situation of establishing patriotic pacts in some villages. This inspection has enabled everyone to further recognize the great political significance of establishing patriotic pacts and the methods of mobilizing the masses to establish them. The inspection revealed that the results of establishing patriotic pacts in the district are very uneven.

    Fenggezhuang is representative of the villages in the district that have done a better job in establishing patriotic pacts. Before establishing the patriotic pact, Fenggezhuang convened meetings of Party members and Youth League members to discuss the significance of establishing the patriotic pact and to develop the steps to be taken. Then, it mobilized all Party members, Youth League members, propagandists, teachers, and others to use blackboard newspapers, radio broadcasts, and other propaganda tools to extensively and deeply publicize the significance of establishing the patriotic pact to the masses; and led the masses of the whole village to hold group discussions, through recalling the atrocities of the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, the masses' political awareness and patriotic enthusiasm were enhanced, and their hatred of imperialism and counter-revolutionary elements deepened. On a conscious and voluntary basis, the masses established patriotic pacts by household, after discussions in family meetings. The content of the patriotic pacts includes the following two points: (1) Political content, such as "Everyone studies current affairs, everyone publicizes, and cares about national affairs"; "Support the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, respond to the government's call, expose and control counter-revolutionary elements, investigate rumors, do a good job of substitute farming, and pay public grain early and well." (2) Combined with personal business, farmers' patriotic pacts propose how to increase production, cultivate intensively and hoe more, and fight against floods and insect pests; village cadres stipulate to strengthen unity, obey the leadership of superiors, maintain close contact with the masses, not be selfish, not be greedy or wasteful, and actively serve the people; some families who often have disputes also propose to live in harmony and work hard in production.

    At the beginning of establishing patriotic pacts, Fenggezhuang also proposed that every household should hold a family meeting to reach everyone; after the establishment, it conducted in-depth inspection and revision, and established an inspection system of one inspection per month. After the first inspection, it re-mobilized households that had not held family meetings to hold family meetings to supplement the patriotic pact, so that the masses of the whole village understood the significance of establishing the patriotic pact, and many people asked district and village cadres to go to their homes to inspect and help revise the patriotic pact.

    Dazhao Village is representative of the villages in the district that have not done a good job in establishing patriotic pacts. Most cadres and the masses in Dazhao Village do not understand the significance of establishing patriotic pacts. As village branch secretary Kou Zhengzhong said afterwards: "We didn't take the establishment of the patriotic pact seriously at all." Party member Wang Chunjia believes that the establishment of the patriotic pact is for "May Day," and it is over after "May Day." The masses said: "We establish it when the cadres tell us to, who knows what it's for?" Therefore, although 90 percent of the 178 households in the village established patriotic pacts, most of the content of the patriotic pacts is not practical, but only empty one or two sentences, such as "Patriotic pact, the whole family produces," "Patriotic pact, support the front line," etc. Many households lost their patriotic pacts after they were established.

    Now the leading cadres of the district have summarized the experience of Fenggezhuang and other villages and promoted it throughout the district. For Dazhao Village and other villages where there is serious formalism in the work of establishing patriotic pacts, the district leaders have instructed them to deeply publicize, mobilize the masses, and revise the patriotic pacts, so that the patriotic pacts can truly play a role.

### 河北省文安县第一区　检查修订爱国公约推广经验纠正偏向

  　河北省文安县第一区
　　检查修订爱国公约推广经验纠正偏向
    河北省文安县第一区，最近曾有重点地深入检查了一部分村子订立爱国公约的情况。这次检查使大家进一步认识了订立爱国公约的重大政治意义和发动群众订立爱国公约的方法。在检查中发现该区订立爱国公约的成绩是很不平衡的。
    该区订立爱国公约较好的村子，以丰各庄为代表。丰各庄在订立爱国公约前，曾召开了党团员会议，讨论了订立爱国公约的意义，并订出进行的步骤。然后动员全村党团员、宣传员、教员等分别利用黑板报、广播筒等宣传工具，广泛而深入地向群众宣传了订立爱国公约的意义；并领导全村群众分组座谈，通过回忆日寇、蒋匪暴行，群众的政治觉悟和爱国热情提高了，对帝国主义、反革命分子的仇恨加深了。群众就在自觉自愿的基础上，以户为单位，经过家庭会议的讨论，订立了爱国公约。爱国公约的内容有这样二点：（一）具有政治内容，如“人人学习时事，人人宣传，关心国家大事”；“拥护共产党和毛主席，响应政府号召，检举和管制反革命分子，追查谣言，作好代耕工作，早缴和缴好公粮”。（二）结合切身业务，农民的爱国公约中都提出如何增加生产，精耕多锄，向水灾、虫灾作斗争等；村干部则订出要加强团结，服从上级领导，密切联系群众，不自私自利，不贪污浪费，积极为人民服务等；有些经常闹纠纷的家庭，还提出要全家和睦，努力生产。
    丰各庄在开始订立爱国公约时，并提出要户户开家庭会议，达到人人皆知；订立后即深入检查修订，并建立了一月检查一次的检查制度。第一次检查后，又重新发动未开过家庭会议的户开家庭会补订爱国公约，作到了全村群众都明白了订立爱国公约意义，并有不少群众要求区村干部到家中检查和帮助修订爱国公约。
    该区爱国公约订的不好的以大赵村为代表。大赵村大部分干部群众对订立爱国公约意义不了解。如村支部书记寇正中事后说：“我们根本没把订爱国公约当回事。”党员王春甲则认为订爱国公约是为了“五一”，“五一”过了就完事了。群众则说：“干部叫订就订，谁知订了干吗？”因此全村一百七十八户中虽然有百分之九十的户订了爱国公约，但绝大部分爱国公约的内容不切合实际，而只是空洞的一两句话，如“爱国公约，全家生产”、“爱国公约、支援前线”等。不少户的爱国公约在订立后就丢失了。
    现在该区领导干部已总结了丰各庄等村的经验，推广到全区。对大赵村等在订立爱国公约工作中有严重形式主义偏向的村子，区领导上已指示他们深入宣传，发动群众，重新修订爱国公约，使爱国公约真正起作用。
