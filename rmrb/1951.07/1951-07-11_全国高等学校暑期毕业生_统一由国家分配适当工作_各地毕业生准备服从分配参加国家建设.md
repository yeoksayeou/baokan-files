　　Xinhua News Agency, 4th. This year's summer graduates from national colleges and universities are completing their studies and preparing to obey the state's unified assignment to take up various work posts in national construction.

　　This year's work of unified allocation of national college graduates is being carried out under the direct leadership of the State Council of the Central People's Government. College graduates in various regions, due to receiving patriotic education, have universally improved their political consciousness, and the vast majority support the state's allocation principles and express their obedience to unified allocation.

　　The main principles of this allocation are, first, overall consideration, to meet the needs of the state's key construction and the business of various central and local departments, and to take care of individual regions with a small number of graduates. In the allocation, medical graduates are handed over to the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government and the Ministry of Health of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission for unified allocation to meet the needs of national defense. Graduates of other departments are decided to be transferred from North China, East China, Central South, and Southwest to supplement the Northeast, Northwest, and various central departments. This year's college graduates will be allocated to work in factories, mines, and other production departments as much as possible; secondly, they will supplement cadres working in organs. In addition, a small number of graduates will be assigned by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government and the Chinese Academy of Sciences to serve as teaching assistants, graduate students, and research interns in research departments affiliated with the Academy of Sciences.

　　Secondly, this allocation will implement the principle of consistency between learning and application as much as possible. The central and local competent authorities have conducted detailed investigations and research on the number of graduates from each department and subject in each college and the number of people needed in the actual work of each business department in advance, and have made preliminary allocation plans for graduates of each department and subject. For example, for graduates of banking, textile, and water conservancy departments, the relevant central departments have also formulated allocation plans for relevant central and local professional departments. Other graduates to be supplied to various central departments are also given to the professional leading organs to make specific allocations, so as to ensure that the learning and application of each graduate are not separated.

　　The number of college graduates in the country this year is only one-tenth of the number requested for allocation by various regions, which is far less than the actual needs of national construction in various aspects. Therefore, in the allocation, various agencies have repeatedly discussed and strived to achieve "reasonable distribution with limited resources." Under such circumstances, every college graduate across the country can get a suitable job after leaving school. The phenomenon of "university graduates being unemployed" under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang is completely eliminated today.

　　After this year's college graduates are assigned to work, the government generally does not stipulate a probationary period; those with original probationary periods in various factories and mines can continue to implement them. The government's treatment of graduates' work has also changed somewhat compared to last year. Except for those who voluntarily participate in the supply system, low salaries will be issued according to the length of study and degree, according to the standards of each region.

　　Before this year's summer college graduates take up their jobs, some regions will also use different methods, based on specific circumstances, to concentrate graduates from various schools for short-term education, so that they can better shoulder the responsibilities of national construction in various aspects.

### 全国高等学校暑期毕业生  统一由国家分配适当工作  各地毕业生准备服从分配参加国家建设

　　全国高等学校暑期毕业生
    统一由国家分配适当工作
    各地毕业生准备服从分配参加国家建设
    【新华社四日讯】全国各地高等学校今年暑期毕业学生，正纷纷结束学业，准备服从国家统一分配，走上国家建设的各种工作岗位。
    今年的全国高等学校毕业生统筹分配工作，是在中央人民政府政务院直接领导下进行的。各地区高等学校毕业生，由于接受了爱国主义教育，政治觉悟普遍提高，绝大部分拥护国家的分配原则并表示服从统一分配。
    这次分配的主要原则，首先是统筹兼顾，以适应国家的重点建设以及中央和地方各部门业务上的需要，并照顾个别毕业学生人数过少的地区。在分配中，医科毕业学生因适应国防需要，交由中央人民政府卫生部和人民革命军事委员会卫生部统一分配。其他各科毕业生，决定从华北、华东、中南、西南各调出一部分，补给东北、西北和中央各部门。今年的高等学校毕业生，将尽量分配到工厂、矿山等生产部门中工作；其次才补充机关工作干部。此外尚有小部分毕业生，由中央人民政府教育部与中国科学院分配担任全国高等学校的助教、研究生与科学院所属研究部门的研究实习员。
    其次，这次分配将尽可能贯彻学用一致的原则。中央和各地的主管机关事先都对各高等学校各系、科的毕业人数与各业务部门实际工作中的需要人数作了详细的调查研究，分别作出了各系、科毕业生的初步分配计划。如银行、纺织、水利等科的毕业生，还由中央各有关部门拟定了中央和地方有关专业部门的分配计划。其他补给中央各部门的毕业生，也都是将总人数交由各专业领导机关分别作具体分配，务期各毕业生学用不致脱节。
    今年全国高等学校毕业生人数，仅为各地区请求分配人数的十分之一，远不及国家各方面建设工作的实际需要。因此在分配中各机关曾再三讨论，争取作到“少得合理”。在这样的情况下，全国各地高等学校毕业生，每一个人在离开学校后，都可以得到适宜的工作岗位。象国民党反动统治下“大学生毕业就是失业”的现象，今天是已经完全消灭了。
    今年高等学校毕业生在分配工作后，见习期限政府一般不作规定；各厂矿原有见习期限者可继续施行。政府对毕业生工作待遇也较去年有所改变，除其自愿参加供给制者外，均可视学习年限、程度，按各地区标准发给低薪。
    在今年暑期高等学校毕业生走上工作岗位前，部分地区并将根据具体情况，采用不同方式，集中各校毕业生进行短期教育，使他们能够更好地担负起国家建设各方面的责任。
