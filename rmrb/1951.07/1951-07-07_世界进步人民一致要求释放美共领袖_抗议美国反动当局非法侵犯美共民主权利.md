Xinhua News Agency, 6th: The world's progressive people are furiously protesting against the fascist atrocities of the US authorities in sentencing and immediately imprisoning the leaders of the Communist Party of the United States.

Since the US Supreme Court unreasonably decided on the 4th of last month to uphold the verdict of the New York Federal Court against the eleven leaders of the US Communist Party based on the unconstitutional Smith Act, progressive people from all countries have continuously demanded that the US Supreme Court retry the case.

After the British Communist Party protested to US Supreme Court Chief Justice Vinson, it sent a delegation to meet with US Ambassador to the UK Gifford to express the British people's opposition to this "most vicious attack on the principles of democracy and freedom of speech." However, the US Embassy refused to meet with the delegation on the grounds that it was "unnecessary."

After learning that the US Communist leaders had been imprisoned, Maurice Thorez, Secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, immediately sent a telegram through the *Daily Worker* of New York to the imprisoned US Communist leaders, expressing brotherly concern. The telegram also stated: The French Communist Party, along with people from all walks of life around the world and within the United States, protests in unison against this violation of the principles of the US Constitution. The French Communist Party will actively participate in the struggle to demand the cancellation of the US Supreme Court's verdict and the cessation of the persecution of the best sons and daughters of the United States. In Paris, railway workers at the Chapelle Station sent a delegation to the US Embassy in France on the 27th of last month to protest.

The Labor-Progressive Party of Canada, the Communist Party of Uruguay, the Communist Party of Guatemala, and the Communist Party of Indonesia have also issued statements or protest letters to US President Truman and letters of condolence to the US Communist leaders. They unanimously demanded that the US judicial authorities revoke the verdict and called on the people of all countries to intensify the struggle to defend peace and strive for democracy, and to strive for the release of the imprisoned US Communist leaders.

The International Association of Democratic Lawyers sent a letter to the US Supreme Court demanding a retrial. The association also called on all legal professionals to protest against the infringement of the rights of the defendants and their defense lawyers.

The Executive Committee of the Irish Workers' Union also passed a resolution strongly protesting against the arrest of the leaders of the Communist Party of the United States by the US authorities, and called on the people of all countries to unite and strengthen the world peace movement in response to the evil actions of the US reactionaries.

Progressive newspapers in various countries, such as the British *Daily Worker*, the Italian *l'Unità*, and the Romanian *Scînteia*, have all published articles condemning the criminal actions of the US reactionaries in attempting to stifle the domestic peace and democratic movement in the United States. An editorial in *l'Unità* pointed out: The mad sentencing of American communists and democrats is ample proof that the groups responsible for American policy and their despicable and shameless allies and friends on this side of the ocean (referring to Europe) are not strong, but weak. ... Today, the organized protests of all democrats can still prevent the realization of new crimes against peace.

　　世界进步人民一致要求释放美共领袖
    抗议美国反动当局非法侵犯美共民主权利
    【新华社六日讯】世界进步人民愤怒抗议美国当局判处美国共产党领袖以徒刑并即予监禁的法西斯暴行。
    自从美国最高法院于上月四日无理决定维持纽约联邦法院依据违反宪法的史密斯法对美共十一位领袖所作判决之后，各国进步人民就一直不断地要求美国最高法院重审这个案件。
    英国共产党在向美国最高法院首席法官文生提出抗议之后，又派遣代表团往见美国驻英大使吉福特，以表示英国人民反对这一“对民主和言论自由原则的最凶恶的进攻”。但是美国大使馆竟以“无必要”为理由拒绝接见代表团。
    法国共产党中央委员会书记杜克洛在知道美共领袖被下狱之后，即经过纽约《工人日报》致电狱中美共领袖，表示兄弟的关切，电报并说：法国共产党与世界各地以及美国国内各界人士，同声抗议这种对美国宪法原则的侵犯。法国共产党将积极参加要求取消美国最高法院的判决和停止对美国最优秀的儿女之迫害的斗争。在巴黎，夏帕尔车站的铁路工人于上月二十七日派代表团向美国驻法大使馆提出抗议。
    加拿大劳工进步党、乌拉圭共产党、危地马拉共产党及印尼共产党，也纷纷发表了声明或对美国总统杜鲁门的抗议书和对美共领袖的慰问书。他们一致要求撤销美国司法当局的判决，并号召各国人民加紧保卫和平与争取民主的斗争，争取释放下狱的美共领袖。
    国际民主法律工作者协会曾致函美国最高法院要求重审。该会并号召一切法律工作者抗议对被告及其辩护律师权利的侵犯。
    爱尔兰工人联盟执行委员会也通过决议，严重抗议美国当局逮捕美国共产党领袖，并号召各国人民团结起来加强世界和平运动，以回答美国反动派的罪恶行动。
    各国进步报纸如英国《工人日报》、意大利《团结报》、罗马尼亚《火花报》等，均著论谴责美国反动派企图扼杀美国国内和平民主运动的犯罪行动。《团结报》的社论指出：对美国共产党人和民主分子的疯狂判罪，充分证明对美国政策负责的集团和他们在大洋这边（指欧洲）的那些卑鄙无耻的同盟者和友人，并不是强大的，而是软弱的。……今天所有民主分子的有组织的抗议，仍然能够制止对和平的新罪行的实现。
