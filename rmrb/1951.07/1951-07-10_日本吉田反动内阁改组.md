Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th. Yoshida Shigeru, the American lackey in Japan, reorganized his cabinet on the 4th in order to adapt to the needs of the illegal separate peace treaty with the United States. Of the original fifteen cabinet members, nine remained in their posts, and six were replaced. The newly appointed cabinet members are: Hashimoto Ryugo (former Deputy Chairman of the Policy Research Council of the Liberal Party) as Minister of Health and Welfare (Minister of Social Welfare) and concurrently Director-General of the Administrative Management Agency, Nemoto Ryutaro (former Chairman of the Policy Research Council of the Liberal Party) as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Takahashi Ryutaro (Chairman of the Green Wind Society Steering Committee) as Minister of International Trade and Industry (Minister of Trade and Industry), Sato Eisaku (former Secretary-General of the Liberal Party) as Minister of Posts and Telecommunications (Minister of Posts and Telecommunications), Noda Uichi (Chairman of the Policy Research Council of the Liberal Party in the House of Councillors) as Minister of Construction, and Masutani Hideji (former Chairman of the General Affairs Council of the Liberal Party) as Minister of State. Except for Takahashi Ryutaro, all are henchmen of Yoshida's Liberal Party.
After the cabinet reshuffle on the 4th, Yoshida stated that the reshuffle was to "further strengthen domestic politics and economy" to cooperate with the separate peace treaty. According to a dispatch from the Electric Communications Agency, Yoshida's plan to reorganize the cabinet was drafted at the beginning of this year. Originally, he attempted to co-opt the conservative opposition National Democratic Party into the cabinet, so that Yoshida could control two-thirds of the seats in the House of Representatives, so as to revise the provisions of the Japanese Constitution prohibiting Japanese rearmament, and facilitate the unbridled rearmament after the separate peace treaty. However, Yoshida's efforts ultimately failed. This cabinet reshuffle only replaced the most mediocre cabinet members with some leaders within the Liberal Party.

　　日本吉田反动内阁改组
    【新华社八日讯】东京消息：美国的日本奴仆吉田茂，为了适应与美国非法单独媾和的需要，在四日改组了他的内阁。在原有的十五个阁员中，九人留任，更换了六人。新任阁员是：厚生相（社会福利大臣）兼行政管理厅长官桥本龙伍（前自由党政务调查会副会长），农林相根本龙太郎（前自由党政务调查会会长），通商产业相（贸易与工业大臣）高桥龙太郎（绿风会会务委员会主席），邮政相兼电气通信相（邮电大臣）佐藤荣作（前自由党干事长），建设相野田卯一（参议院自由党政务调查会会长），国务相益谷秀次（前自由党总务会会长）。其中除了高桥龙太郎以外，都是吉田的自由党的爪牙。
    吉田四日在内阁改组后发表谈话说：这次内阁改组是为了“更进一步加强国内的政治和经济”，以配合单独媾和。据电通社讯，吉田的改组内阁的计划是在今年年初拟订的，原来企图拉拢保守的在野党国民民主党入阁，使吉田能够控制众院的三分之二的议席，借以修改日本宪法关于禁止日本重新武装的规定，便于在单独媾和后放手进行重新武装的工作。但是，吉田的努力终于失败。这次改组内阁只是用自由党党内的一部分领袖来代替最平庸的阁员而已。
