Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 14th: TASS reports: The Soviet Union's harvest work is in full swing. Farmers across the country, reaping the fruits of their labor, are rapidly delivering public grain to the state.

　　Grain in the central regions of the Soviet Union has gradually ripened. Harvesting has begun in the Volga region. Collective farms in the region have been delivering 4,000 to 6,000 poods of grain to state granaries in a single day. Farmers in the Kursk, Tambov, Voronezh, and Orel regions have also started harvesting. Seven regions in Kazakhstan are currently harvesting. In Ukraine, two-thirds of the harvested grain from collective farms has been threshed. The grain is transported directly from the threshing grounds to state granaries. The Odessa region has delivered 250,000 poods more public grain to the state this year compared to the same period last year. Dozens of collective farms in Moldova have harvested 16, 18, or 20 centners of grain per hectare. This year, there are twice as many combine harvesters, trucks, harvesters, and threshing machines working in the fields of Moldova compared to last year, and a large number of agricultural machine drivers have been trained. In Kuban, advanced work teams are harvesting 40 centners of barley, 25 centners of rye, and 20 to 30 centners of winter wheat per hectare in vast areas. Agricultural machine drivers in Kuban are striving to reduce harvesting time and improve quality. Hundreds of combine harvester drivers in the area can harvest 30 to 40 hectares of grain per day. Vehicles are transporting grain to state granaries day and night.

　　While harvesting grain, collective farmers in the cotton-growing regions are also carefully tending to cotton seedlings. Soviet sugar beet growers are working hard for a bumper harvest. Tatnova, a famous sugar beet grower in Kazakhstan, has set a new record goal, planning to harvest 2,000 centners of sugar beets per hectare.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 14th: Soviet machine manufacturing has exceeded its plan for the first half of this year, with a significant increase in output. According to TASS, Moscow: In the first half of this year, Soviet machine manufacturing factories have produced more machines and equipment than in the first half of last year, to supply the steel, oil, and power industries. The highest output increases were in rolling mills, high-pressure boilers, turbines, hydraulic turbines, and other equipment. Soviet heavy machinery manufacturing workers have been able to continuously produce fast, automatic elevators capable of carrying twenty people and are mastering the production methods of high-efficiency new iron smelting furnaces, pipe-making machines, and other equipment. Heavy machinery manufacturing factories across the country are striving to complete all orders required for the great communist construction projects of the Soviet Union ahead of schedule. In recent months, a large number of cranes and conveyors have been produced for the Volga-Don Canal. Heavy-duty gantry cranes required for the Tsimlyanskaya hydroelectric power project have been manufactured. Two such cranes can lift machines and parts weighing up to 300 tons. The machine manufacturing industry has also mastered the technology for producing the following machines: light cranes with a lifting capacity of up to ten tons, water gates up to thirty meters long, and powerful excavators with steel drills two meters in diameter for dredging pumps.

　　Soviet agricultural machinery manufacturing plants have exceeded their plan for the first six months of this year. The output of self-propelled combine harvesters has nearly increased sixfold compared to the first half of last year, grain harvesting combines have increased by 26 percent, flax harvesting combines have increased by 25 percent, cotton pickers have tripled, and tractor-drawn seeders have increased by 19 percent. This year, the manufacturing technology of more than fifteen new types of agricultural machinery, such as sugar beet harvesting combines and industrial crop rubber grass seeders, has been mastered. The large-scale use of these machines will further mechanize the laborious field work.

　　苏联夏季丰收各地农民迅速交纳公粮
    机器制造业已经超额完成上半年计划
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联的收获工作如火如荼地进行着。各地农民收割了丰硕的劳动果实，迅速地给国家交纳公粮。
    苏联中部各州的谷物已渐次成熟。伏尔加州已开始收割。该州集体农场在一天之内已向国家粮站交纳了四千到六千普特的谷物。库尔斯克，坦波夫、佛罗内兹和奥勒尔各州的农民已开始收割。哈萨克有七个州正在收割。乌克兰的集体农场收割完的谷物已有三分之二打好了。谷物直接从打谷场送到国家粮站。敖德萨州今年向国家缴纳的公粮比去年同一时期多二十五万普特。摩尔达维亚有几十个集体农场每公顷打了十六、十八或者二十生丁纳的谷物。今年在摩尔达维亚田地上工作的联合收割机为去年的两倍，卡车、收割机和打谷机也有两倍，现在已训练了大批农业机器司机。库班的先进工作队在广大地区上每公顷收获四十生丁纳的大麦、二十五生丁纳的裸麦和二十到三十生丁纳的冬季小麦。库班的农业机器司机正力求减少收割所需的时间并改善质量。该地几百个联合收割机的司机每天可收割三十到四十公顷的谷物。车辆日夜不停地把谷物送到国家粮站去。
    植棉各州的集体农民一方面收割谷物，一方面又细心地照料棉苗。苏联的甜菜种植者正为丰收而努力工作。哈萨克的著名甜菜种植者塔特诺娃已定下创造新纪录的目标，她计划每公顷要收获二千生丁纳的制糖甜菜。
    【新华社十四日讯】苏联机器制造业已超额完成今年上半年的计划，产量大为增加。据塔斯社莫斯科讯：今年上半年苏联机器制造工厂已比去年上半年生产了更多的机器和装备，以供应钢铁、石油和动力等工业部门。其中产量最高的是辗钢机、高压汽锅、透平、水力透平等。苏联的重机器制造工人已能够连续生产可载二十个人的快速自动升降机，并正在掌握高效率的新熔铁炉、制管机和其他装备的生产方法。各地的重机器制造工厂正争取提前完成苏联伟大共产主义建设工程所需的一切订货。最近数月内已为伏尔加河——顿河运河生产了大量的起重机和搬运机。齐姆良斯卡雅水力发电工程所需的重型制架起重机已经制造出来，两架这种起重机可以举起重达三百吨的机器和零件。机器制造业还掌握了生产下列机器的技术：举重量可达十吨的轻便起重机、长达三十公尺的水栅、供挖泥泵使用的带有直径两公尺的钢钻的强大开凿机。
    苏联农业机器制造厂已超额完成今年头六个月的计划。自动推进收割机的产量差不多增加为去年上半年的六倍，谷物收割联合机增加了百分之二十六，亚麻收割联合机增加了百分之二十五，摘棉机增加为三倍，拖拉机牵引播种机增加了百分之十九。今年已掌握了甜菜收割联合机、工业作物橡胶草播种机等十五种以上的新式农业机器的制造技术。这些机器的大规模使用，将使十分费力的田间工作进一步机械化。
