Engineering Design Personnel Must Break the "Employee Mentality"
　　Zhang Yuanshou, Technician of Chongqing Tire Factory

    The People's Daily editorial on June 16th, "Construction is Impossible Without Engineering Design," I feel, sounded an alarm for those engaged in basic construction engineering in New China. Since then, every time I read the newspaper and see this type of article and report, I organize relevant technical personnel to start discussions. During the discussions, we exposed the erroneous thinking left over from the old society, the most serious of which is the "employee mentality."

    Before liberation, there was of course no talk of what constituted basic construction. At that time, we also did so-called engineering design and other work, but these were "tasks" handed down by the bureaucrats. We could only cater to their personal intentions when doing design work. For example, if they wanted to start a factory! Regardless of whether the principles they handed down were correct or possible, we only did as they said, completing the task. We did not collect relevant data beforehand; investigation and research into things like geology, wind direction, climate, resources, etc. was out of the question. This kind of design would never be practical. If rework occurred during construction, it was considered not a big deal. Sometimes we occasionally felt that doing so was inappropriate, but in that society, we had no opportunity to speak. Those bureaucrats were only using our "technology" as stepping stones for their promotion and fortune. At that time, if your work was slightly unsuitable for their intentions, you would immediately lose your job. The technical abilities of many technical personnel were buried, and they were forced to change careers, suffering for life.

    After liberation, we felt that everything had changed. What surprised us the most was that basic construction work had already begun in the country in the short year or so since the founding of the People's Republic of China. Take the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway in Sichuan! From the Qing Dynasty to the present, for forty years, many bureaucrats shouted about building the railway, but we only saw them use it to collect more "construction donations" to fill their pockets, without ever starting construction. Now, under the leadership of the People's Government, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has partially opened to traffic. After liberation, through study, I clearly recognized that I am a member of the working class and a master of the country. In my work, we can put forward our own opinions. So, I feel that today's construction work is fundamentally different from the old society. Now it is not simply completing someone's task, but doing a good job of our own people's affairs. Our work today is no longer responsible to a few people, but to the people. In our work, we should try to consider all possible situations.

    I believe that to do a good job in engineering design, the following two points need attention:

    (1) There must be a serious and responsible work attitude. Today, technical personnel can no longer have the idea of "complete whatever task with whatever conditions are given." You must know that now we are not working for bureaucratic capital, but doing a good job of the people's own affairs, seeking happiness for ourselves and our children. Therefore, we must not only use the original working conditions, but also use our brains to create conditions. For example, in past construction projects, only foreign materials were used, believing that only their materials met the standards and specifications. Today, we must make domestic materials also meet specifications and standards, do more research, make more suggestions to the leading organs, and establish various unified engineering standards.

    (2) It is necessary to connect with the masses and combine with reality. This sentence is easy to say, but often overlooked in work. Among technical personnel, it is easiest to have the idea of looking down on workers, and they cannot consult and research well with the workers. For example, in the Beijing Paper Mill's sewer project, if the personnel in charge could consult with the workers in the factory and investigate the actual situation more, they would not have suffered a loss of more than 100 million yuan. The main reason for other project failures is also that the design is divorced from reality.

    Under the sunshine of Chairman Mao, we can happily use our abilities to work for the people. However, what one person sees is inevitably limited; the eyes of the masses are bright. We must learn from the examples of failed projects in the People's Daily, be vigilant at all times, encourage each other, and work harder to build a new China!

### 工程设计人员要打破“雇佣观点”

　　工程设计人员要打破“雇佣观点”
    重庆轮胎厂技师　张元绶
    人民日报六月十六日发表《没有工程设计就不可能施工》的社论，我觉得是向新中国从事基本建设工程人员敲了一次警钟。以后每次读报看到有这一类的文章和报道时，就组织有关技术人员展开讨论。在讨论中，我们揭发了旧社会遗留给我们的错误思想，其中最严重的就是“雇佣观点”。
    在解放前，当然谈不到什么是基本建设。那时，我们也曾做过所谓工程设计等工作，但那是官僚交下来的“任务”。我们只能迎合他个人的意图来做设计工作。譬如要创办一个工厂吧！不管他们交下来的原则是否正确或是否可能，只有照着去做，完成任务了事，事先也不收集有关资料，什么地质、风向、气候、资源等，情况的调查研究根本谈不上。这样设计就永远不会切合实际。施工时返了工也认为算不了什么。有时也偶然觉得这样做是不妥当的，但是那时的社会就没有我们说话的机会。那般官僚们不过是利用我们的“技术”做他们升官发财的垫脚石。在那时候，你的工作稍不适合他意，马上便会失业。多少技术人员的技术能力被埋没了，他们被迫改行，苦闷终身。
    解放后，我们感觉到一切都变了样。最使我们惊奇的，就是中华人民共和国成立后短短一年多中就已开始了国家的基本建设工作。就如四川成渝铁路吧！从满清到现在四十年来也曾有不少官僚喊着要修铁路，但是只看见他们借此多收些“建设捐”以充饱他们的私囊，就不曾动过工。而今，在人民政府领导下，成渝路已经部分通车。解放后，我经过了学习，明确地认识了自己是工人阶级一分子，是国家的主人翁。在工作中，我们可以提出自己的意见。所以我觉得今天的建设工作基本上是与旧社会不相同的。现在不是单纯的完成某一个人的任务，而是要搞好咱们人民自己的家务。我们今天的工作，再不是向少数几个人负责，而是要向人民负责。在我们的工作中，就应该尽量考虑可能发生的各种情况。
    我认为要把工程设计做好，需要注意下列两点：
    （一）要有认真负责的工作态度。在今天，技术人员不能再存在着“给我什么条件就完成什么任务”的思想。要知道现在不是替官僚资本做事，而是搞好人民自己的家务，为自己和儿女们谋幸福。所以，我们不但要利用原有的工作条件，还要动脑筋创造条件。譬如以往建设工程，非外国的材料不用，认为只有他们的材料合乎标准和规格。在今天，我们要使国产的材料也合乎规格和标准，多研究，多向领导机关建议，建立各种统一的工程规范。
    （二）要联系群众，结合实际。这句话说来容易，工作中时常会疏忽。在技术人员中，最容易有瞧不起工人的思想，不能很好地同工人商量和研究。就如北京造纸厂的下水道工程，经办人员若能同厂内工人商量，多调查实际情况，就不会遭受一亿多元的损失。其他工程失败的主要原因，也多是设计与实际脱了节。
    我们在毛主席的阳光照耀下，可以愉快地发挥自己的能力为人民做事。但是，一人所见，必然有限；群众眼光是明亮的。我们要从人民日报所载各项工程失败的事例中吸取经验和教训，随时警惕，互相勉励，更好地为建设新中国而努力！
