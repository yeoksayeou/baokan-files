　　Summer Grain Collection Work Deployed in the Suburbs of Beijing
    Patriotic Education Combined with Borrowing Grain
    On June 27th, the Suburban Work Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, based on the "Instructions on the 1951 Summer Grain Collection Work" promulgated by the Government Administration Council, deployed this year's summer grain collection work to the suburban districts of the city.

    Under the specific leadership and assistance of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the peasants in the suburbs of Beijing have resolved production difficulties through loans, fertilizer loans, seed loans, cart loans, livestock loans, waterwheel loans, and loans for various agricultural tools. Last autumn, a total of more than 185,000 mu of irrigated and dry land were planted in the entire suburban area; this spring, more than 55,000 mu of vegetable gardens and three-season irrigated land were planted. In April and May of this year, thanks to the timely leadership of the government, the mobilization of the masses to fight drought and eliminate diseases, various disasters were overcome, ensuring the summer harvest, with wheat generally yielding about 60%. During the wheat harvest, the government mobilized the masses to carry out field seed selection and quality seed comparison activities. The harvest of vegetable gardens and three-season irrigated land was also higher than in previous years due to the gradual use of scientific methods. In order to make this year's summer grain collection more reasonable, the Suburban Work Committee and the Finance Bureau of the Municipal People's Government jointly organized an investigation team to conduct typical summer harvest yield surveys in various suburban districts. Based on the specific conditions in the suburbs, the policy for this year's suburban collection is: summer borrowing, autumn collection (i.e., settlement in the autumn, with refunds for overpayments and supplements for underpayments), garden land and three-season irrigated land can be collected in part with currency, and for ease of calculation, local surcharges are collected together; the standard for borrowing is 20% of the summer income, and appropriately increase or decrease according to the actual situation of each village and household; fruit tree land with summer income can be borrowed by the district at its discretion; the deadline for completion is July 15th. The Suburban Work Committee instructed all districts to combine patriotic anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda when borrowing grain from farmers, and on the basis of raising farmers' awareness and doing a good job in production, to call on farmers to "pay early," "pay completely," "pay good grain," and "pay clean grain." It is estimated that, with the unprecedented rise of patriotic enthusiasm among farmers in the suburbs, the summer grain collection task will be completed quickly. (Ding Zi)

　　京郊布置夏征工作
    在借征时结合进行爱国主义教育
    北京市人民政府郊区工作委员会，在六月二十七日，根据政务院公布的“关于一九五一年夏季征收公粮工作的指示”，向各郊区布置了本市今年的夏征工作。
    京郊农民，在共产党和人民政府的具体领导帮助下，经过了贷款、贷肥、贷种、贷大车、贷牲畜、贷水车以及各种农具，解决了生产上的困难。去年秋天全郊区共种水地旱地十八万五千多亩；今春菜园地和三大季水浇地共种了五万五千多亩。今年四、五月间，由于政府领导及时，发动群众抗旱除病，战胜了各种灾害，保证了夏收，小麦一般收获在六成左右。在麦收时，政府发动了群众展开了田间选种和评比良种运动。菜园地和三大季水浇地的收获，由于逐步利用科学方法，也比往年为高。市人民政府郊区工作委员会和财政局，为了使今年夏征趋于合理，曾共同组织了调查组，到各郊区进行了夏收产量典型调查。根据郊区具体情况，规定今年郊区征收政策是：夏借秋征（即秋季结算，多退少补），园地和三大季水浇地可折收一部货币，为了计算简便，将地方附加粮合并征收；按夏季收入百分之二十为借征标准，按照各村、户实际情况，适当提高或降低；有夏季收入的果树地，可由区里酌量借征；规定七月十五日完成。郊区工作委员会指示各区，在向农民借征时，要结合抗美援朝的爱国主义宣传，在提高农民的觉悟和搞好生产的基础上，号召农民“早缴”、“齐缴”、“缴好粮”、“缴干净粮”。估计郊区农民，在爱国主义热情空前高涨情况下，夏征任务是会很快完成的。（丁紫）
