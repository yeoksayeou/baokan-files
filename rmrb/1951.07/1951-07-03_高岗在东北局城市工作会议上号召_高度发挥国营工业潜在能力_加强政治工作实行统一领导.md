　　Gao Gang Calls for Highly Developing the Potential of State-Owned Industry
    Strengthening Political Work to Implement Unified Leadership
    The Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee convened an urban work conference from May 18th to June 2nd. The first phase of the meeting (eleven days) discussed the work of state-owned factories. Attending were 382 leading cadres from the Northeast and provincial/municipal levels in charge of industrial production in administrative, Party affairs, labor unions, and the Communist Youth League, as well as managers, factory directors, Party committee secretaries, and labor union chairmen from certain important industrial and mining enterprises.

    At the meeting, the Northeast Bureau put forward three draft documents: "Resolution on Strengthening the Party's Leadership over State-Owned Enterprises," "Summary of Administrative Management Work in State-Owned Industrial and Mining Enterprises," and "Outline of Basic-Level Trade Union Work in Northeast Public Enterprises." Wang Heshou, Minister of Industry of the Northeast People's Government, Zhang Xiushan, Minister of Organization of the Northeast Bureau, Kai Feng, Secretary of the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee, and Ma Hong, Deputy Secretary-General of the Northeast Bureau, also made important reports and speeches. Several factory directors, Party committee secretaries, and basic-level trade union chairmen introduced typical experiences.

    After a week of repeated discussions, Comrade Gao Gang gave a summary at the end.
        The Great Achievements of Industrial Recovery and Development in the Northeast
    Gao Gang first made the following assessment of the recovery and development of state-owned industry in the Northeast over the past five years, especially in the recent two years: First, production has been continuously increasing. The total output value of the Ministry of Industry system increased by 117.3 percent in 1950 compared to 1949, and the plan for 1951 is an increase of 18 percent compared to 1950. Labor productivity in major departments has exceeded the highest level under the puppet Manchurian regime. Second, the working and living conditions of workers have improved to a certain extent. Workers' wages increased by 27 percent at the end of 1949 compared to the beginning of the same year, and by 12.5 percent in 1950. Further increases are planned recently. Supplementary wages account for 11 to 13 percent of the total wage bill in 1951. The construction of workers' housing was 700,000 square meters in 1949 and 1.2 million square meters in 1950. Third, the state has implemented preliminary planned management and economic accounting systems for industrial production and has gained some experience. Fourth, the specialized organs of state management of industry and the administrative structures of enterprises have been strengthened, and a system of specialized responsibility management has been initially implemented. Fifth, Party organizations (with Party members accounting for 11.4 percent of the total number of workers), Communist Youth League organizations (with League members accounting for 41.8 percent of the total number of young workers), and trade union organizations (with approximately 80 percent of industrial workers joining the union) have been established in factories and mines, and some initial experiences on how the Party and trade unions can improve production have been gained.

    Gao Gang pointed out that these achievements were made under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, relying on the entire working class, implementing democratic reforms, establishing new management systems, and with the help of Soviet experts and the efforts of all cadres and workers.
            The Current Serious Tasks of Industrial Production in the Northeast
    Based on the above situation and after research and analysis, Gao Gang proposed that the current serious political task of industrial production in the Northeast is to mobilize all forces to develop the potential of industry and strive to increase production and savings worth the equivalent of five million tons of grain for the country this year. The solutions are: First, accelerate the turnover of working capital, shorten the cycle by 45 days, and save 2 million tons of investment. Second, reduce the actual cost of various products by 10 percent compared to last year, and strive to accumulate an extra 1.5 million tons. Third, improve equipment utilization, improve operating methods, reduce waste, and improve quality, striving to increase the total value of products by 7 to 8 percent compared to the original plan, estimated at an increase of 1.5 million tons. In addition to the amount saved, the above three items can increase the country's wealth by 1.7 million tons (i.e., 1.5 million tons in reduced costs and 200,000 tons in increased production profits).
            Completing and Exceeding Production, Technical and Financial Plans
            Several Most Important Problems That Must Be Solved
    Gao Gang emphasized that this serious political task is the common task of the Party, administration, trade unions, and Communist Youth League in factories and mines. In order to accomplish this task, it is necessary to rely on the working class to solve the following most important problems:

    First, strengthen technical management and improve product quality in order to save raw materials, reduce costs, and facilitate sales. To this end, it is necessary to: 1. Correctly formulate technical standards and quality specifications for products. 2. Formulate, review, and organize the design of products. New products must be tested and used before mass production to prevent waste and ensure quality. 3. Comprehensively review and revise technical operating procedures. The principle is to maximize equipment efficiency, ensure quality, and ensure the safety of workers and mechanical equipment. 4. Strengthen independent inspection work. Strict inspections should be carried out from raw materials, semi-finished products, and finished products to each process. 5. Define the responsibilities of engineering and technical personnel. 6. Stipulate appropriate pricing policies to stimulate the improvement of product quality.

    Second, strengthen financial management and accelerate the turnover of working capital. To this end, it is first necessary to reasonably stipulate the quotas (quantity and time) for the use and reserve of raw materials, meticulously organize the production process, shorten the production cycle, and reduce the backlog of raw materials and products. Secondly, it is necessary to do a good job in the product distribution plan, conscientiously implement the contract system, and actively carry out sales work.

    Third, strengthen cost management and strive to reduce costs. The methods are: 1. Correctly formulate planned costs and oppose conservative thinking; 2. Implement financial management according to cost plans and quotas; 3. Regularly conduct cost analysis and research work to identify key issues and improve work; 4. Promote cost accounting to the workshop and transform cost reduction into a conscious action of every employee.

    Fourth, do a good job in capital construction work. To this end, it is necessary to: 1. Strengthen design work, strictly carry out construction according to plans and designs, and oppose blindness and adventurism; 2. Adopt the management methods of economic accounting for capital construction work; 3. Organize on-site inspections of projects, strengthen technical management, and ensure quality; 4. Strengthen the responsibility of local Party and government for the inspection, supervision, and guarantee of capital construction, and the basic construction materials sold by local governments (such as bricks and tiles) should be guaranteed to be of excellent quality.

    Fifth, improve working conditions and improve the lives of workers on the basis of developing production. The Party, administration, trade unions, and Communist Youth League in factories and mines should, under existing possible conditions, formulate plans to solve these problems with the most positive attitude. In particular, facilities related to improving the working conditions of workers should be resolved first. Secondly, it is necessary to promote the piece-rate wage system and the reward system. Promote the experience of collective contracts, linked contracts, and team collective covenants. In order to better complete the state's production, technical and financial plans, strive for more factory director funds, and gradually improve the lives of workers.

    Sixth, cultivate and improve cadres, especially a large number of technical cadres and technical workers.

    Gao Gang instructed all production units to quickly draw up specific implementation plans for the above tasks.
            Political Work Must Be Further Strengthened
        Implement Unified Leadership of Party, Government, Trade Union, and Youth League
    In order to rely on the working class to better complete and exceed the state's production, technical and financial plans, Gao Gang emphasized that it is necessary to further strengthen Party-mass work and implement unified leadership. To this end, it is necessary to:

    First, achieve the unified leadership of the Party, administration, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League centered on the implementation of the national economic plan. The prerequisite for implementing unified leadership lies in unifying thoughts and unifying understanding. The most basic thing is the idea of relying on the working class and resolutely completing and exceeding the national economic plan; that is, the unified understanding that the Party, administration, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League have consistent stances, consistent interests, and consistent overall tasks. Therefore, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of combining the factory director responsibility system with democratic management and overcome the view of opposing the factory director responsibility system with democratic management. Adhere to the principle of combining political work with economic work and overcome the view of opposing political work with economic work. Adhere to the principle of gradually improving the lives of workers on the basis of production development and overcome the view of opposing the development of production with improving the lives of workers. Adhere to the principle of combining the labor creation of workers with the science and technology of technical personnel and overcome the view of opposing employees, labor, and technology. It is necessary to continue to establish and strengthen the overall holistic view on these issues.

    Second, strengthen the role of basic-level Party organizations in industrial and mining enterprises to guarantee and supervise administrative production work. Based on the current situation in the Northeast and the preliminary experience of some factories and mines, it is determined that the scope of the Party's guarantee and supervision mainly includes the following five aspects: 1. Struggling to realize the state's production, technical and financial plans is the central content of the Party's basic-level organizations implementing guarantee and supervision. To this end, the Party organization should discuss the plan proposed by the factory director, study the principles and steps for implementing the plan, grasp the key issues of production, formulate a specific work plan for how the Party can guarantee and improve the national economic plan; mobilize Party members and all employees to fight for its realization. With this as the center, unify the thinking of the Party, administration, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League within the enterprise. 2. Check and supervise the enterprise's implementation of the Party's policies and the instructions and resolutions of the higher-level government and higher-level economic organs, especially the implementation of the economic accounting system and labor protection laws, criticize and correct ineffective implementation and deviations in implementation. 3. Guarantee and supervise the correct implementation of the factory director responsibility system and democratic management. 4. Understand and cultivate cadres, assist the administration in correctly allocating cadres, implement reward and punishment regulations, implement the policy of uniting technical personnel and employees, and investigate and clear out counter-revolutionary elements in the enterprise. 5. Fight against illegal and undisciplined behavior, destruction of policies, destruction of production and labor discipline, corruption and waste, misinterpretation of national policies, and bureaucratism.

    After clarifying the country's plan, discussing and studying the factory's specific plan, and formulating a plan for how the Party can guarantee it, the Party should mobilize Party members in the administration, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League to formulate their own plans, lead the masses, lead production teams and workshops to make competition plans, seize the key, overcome difficulties, and complete and exceed the plan by using political work methods. To this end, a series of propaganda and organizational work should be carried out from within the Party to outside the Party, and criticism and self-criticism should be carried out to strengthen the Party's political and ideological leadership in the enterprise.

    Third, the basis of the Party's political work in enterprises is mass work, and mass work is mainly trade union work, so it is necessary to do a good job in basic-level trade unions. On this issue, 1. it is necessary to fully promote democracy with production development as the center and do a good job in three things: production, life, and education, using persuasion and mobilization. 2. Improve the organizational leadership of trade unions, gradually establish organizations according to needs and possibilities, and oppose formalism. Reduce meetings, forms, and all unnecessary paperwork. Strengthen the leadership of local trade unions over industrial trade unions in order to unify the pace and implement the current central work. Higher-level trade unions must use their greatest strength to frequently delve into basic-level organizations to study problems, solve problems, cultivate typical examples, and promote advanced experiences.

    Fourth, regarding the relationship between local Party committees and local governments and state-owned industrial and mining enterprises, there have been great improvements in general, but the following two points should be overcome, namely: 1. Local Party and government organs regard the quality of production of state-owned enterprises as the responsibility of higher-level economic organs, and they can be irresponsible or less responsible: 2. The leading cadres of some state-owned enterprises emphasize vertical leadership, do not respect the opinions of local Party and government leading organs and local government laws and regulations, and do not actively obtain their leadership and assistance.
            Responsibilities of Local Party Committees and Local Governments
            for State-Owned Enterprises
    To this end, in addition to emphasizing that the leading personnel of all enterprises should actively obtain the leadership and assistance of local Party committees and educate all employees to model and abide by and implement the laws and regulations of local governments, Gao Gang also determined that local Party committees should bear the following work responsibilities for state-owned enterprises: 1. Discuss and check the implementation of the national production plan by local state-owned enterprises, as well as the implementation of the country's policies, laws, and regulations and the resolutions and instructions of higher-level economic organs, in a planned and regular manner. 2. Correctly lead the Party's work and mass work in enterprises, uniformly formulate plans related to the Party and mass work in factories, unify the work arranged by the Party and mass systems, unify the pace, and ensure the completion and exceeding of production tasks. Systematically cultivate and create typical examples and promote typical experiences. 3. Organize cadres from all aspects of the city, systematically educate the working class on basic revolutionary knowledge, organize and lead the study of enterprise cadres, improve the policy and ideological level of enterprise cadres, correct illegal and undisciplined behavior and corruption among some cadres, and assist higher-level enterprise administrative organs in correctly selecting and allocating enterprise cadres. 4. Unify leadership over security work in local state-owned enterprises.

    Local governments should bear the following responsibilities for local state-owned enterprises: 1. Supervise and check the implementation of national laws and regulations in state-owned enterprises, especially the implementation of labor policies. 2. In municipal construction, the viewpoint of serving the working class and serving production must be implemented. For example, in terms of factory buildings, sewers, electricity, fire protection, housing, roads, transportation, and sanitation, the needs of local state-owned enterprises should be given priority. 3. Be responsible for solving the possible product sales and raw material procurement work of local state-owned enterprises, and organize processing and ordering work between public and private sectors.

　　高岗在东北局城市工作会议上号召
    高度发挥国营工业潜在能力
    加强政治工作实行统一领导
    中共中央东北局于五月十八日至六月二日召开了城市工作会议。会议第一阶段（十一天）讨论国营工厂工作问题。出席者有东北及省市一级领导工业生产的行政、党务、工会、青年团主要领导干部与某些重要工矿企业的经理、厂长、党委书记与工会主席共三百八十二人。
    在会议上东北局提出了“关于党对国营企业领导的决议”“关于国营工矿企业行政管理工作的总结”“东北公营企业基层工会工作提纲”等三个草案。东北人民政府工业部部长王鹤寿，东北局组织部长张秀山，中共沈阳市委书记凯丰，东北局副秘书长马洪等亦作了重要的报告与发言，并有若干厂长、党委书记、基层工会主席介绍典型经验。
    会议经过一星期的反复讨论，最后由高岗同志作总结。
        东北工业恢复发展的巨大成绩
    高岗首先对五年来，特别是最近两年来东北国营工业的恢复发展情况作出如下估计：第一、生产不断提高。工业部系统的生产总值，一九五○年比一九四九年增加百分之一百一十七点三，一九五一年计划比一九五○年增加百分之十八，主要部门劳动生产率已超过伪满最高水平。第二、工人的劳动生活条件有了一定的改善。职工工资一九四九年底与同年初比较提高了百分之二十七，一九五○年提高百分之十二点五，最近还准备提高一些。附加工资一九五一年占工资总额的百分之十一至十三。修建职工住宅一九四九年为七十万平方米，一九五○年为一百二十万平方米。第三、国家已实行了对工业生产的初步的计划管理及经济核算制度，并取得了一些经验。第四、加强了国家管理工业的专业机关及企业的行政机构，初步地实行了专责制的管理。第五、在厂矿中已建立了党的组织（党员占工人总数的百分之十一点四），青年团的组织（团员占青年工人总数百分之四十一点八）及工会的组织（约有百分之八十的产业工人入会），并得到一些党和工会如何搞好生产的初步经验。
    高岗指出：这些成绩的取得，是在毛主席、党中央的领导之下，依靠全体工人阶级，实行民主改革，建立新的经营管理制度以及苏联专家的帮助和全体干部与职工努力的结果。
            东北工业生产当前的严重任务
    根据上述情况经过研究分析的结果，高岗提出：东北工业生产当前的严重政治任务就是要动员一切力量发挥工业的潜在能力，争取今年为国家增产和节约价值等于五百万吨粮食的财富。解决的办法是：一、加速流动资金周转，缩短周期四十五天，节约二百万吨投资。二、将各种产品的实际成本比去年降低百分之十，争取超额积累一百五十万吨。三、提高设备运用率，改善操作方法，减少废品，提高质量，争取产品总值较原计划增加百分之七到百分之八，约计增加一百五十万吨。以上三项除节约数目之外，可给国家增加财富利润一百七十万吨（即降低成本一百五十万吨，提高产量的利润二十万吨）。
            完成与超过生产技术财务计划
            必须解决的几个最主要的问题
    高岗强调指出：这个严重的政治任务是厂矿中的党、行政、工会、青年团的共同任务。为要完成这一任务，必须依靠工人阶级解决以下几个最主要的问题：
    第一，加强技术管理，提高产品质量，以便节约原材料，降低成本，便利推销。为此必须：一、正确地制定产品的技术标准及质量规格。二、制定、审查和组织产品的设计工作。新产品一定要经过试作试用之后才能大量生产，以防浪费并保证质量。三、全面审查与修订技术操作规程。其原则是发挥设备效能，保证质量，保证职工和机电设备的安全。四、加强独立的检验工作。从原材料、半成品、成品以至每个工序，都进行严格检查。五、确定工程技术人员的职责。六、规定恰当的价格政策，以刺激产品质量的提高。
    第二，加强财务管理，加速流动资金的周转。为此首先要合理规定原材料的使用与储备的定额（数量和时间），周密地组织生产过程，缩短生产周期，减少原材料与产品的积压。其次要搞好产品的分配计划，认真执行合同制，积极开展推销工作。
    第三，加强成本管理，争取降低成本。办法是：一、正确制定计划成本，反对保守思想；二、根据成本计划及定额实行财务管理；三、经常进行成本的分析与研究工作，找出关键问题改进工作；四、把成本核算推行到车间，把降低成本变成为每个职工自觉的行动。
    第四，搞好基本建设工作。为此必须：一、加强设计工作，严格地按计划与设计进行施工，反对盲目性与冒险性；二、采取经济核算制的经营方法进行基本建设工作；三、组织工程现场检查，加强技术管理，保证质量；四、加强地方党及政府对基本建设的检查、监督及保证的责任，地方出售的基本建设材料（如砖瓦等），应保证优良的质量。
    第五，改善劳动条件，在发展生产的基础上改善职工生活。厂矿中的党、行政、工会、青年团应在现有的可能条件下，以最积极的态度定出解决这些问题的计划。特别是有关改善职工劳动条件的设施应首先解决。其次要推行计件工资制和奖励制。推广集体合同、联系合同和小组集体公约的经验。以便更好地完成国家生产技术财务计划，争取更多的厂长基金，从而逐步地改善职工生活。
    第六，培养和提高干部，特别是大量培养技术干部与技术工人。
    高岗责成各生产单位，要迅速拟出上述各项工作的具体实施计划。
            必须进一步加强政治工作
        实行党政工团的统一领导
    为了依靠工人阶级更好地完成与超过国家的生产技术财务计划，高岗强调指出必须进一步加强党群工作与实行统一领导。为此必须：
    第一、实现党、行政、工会、青年团以实行国家经济计划为中心的统一领导。实行统一领导的前提在于统一思想统一认识，最基本的就是依靠工人阶级与坚决完成和超过国家经济计划的思想；也就是党、行政、工会、青年团立场一致、利益一致、总的任务一致的统一认识。因此必须坚持厂长负责制与管理民主化结合的方针，克服将厂长负责制与管理民主化对立的观点。坚持政治工作与经济工作结合的方针，克服将政治工作与经济工作对立的观点。坚持在生产的基础上逐步改善工人生活的方针，克服发展生产与改善工人生活对立的观点。坚持工人的劳动创造与技术人员的科学技术相结合的方针，克服职工对立、劳动与技术对立的观点。必须继续树立与加强在这些问题上的全面整体观点。
    第二、加强工矿企业基层党组织对行政生产工作的保证监督作用。根据东北当前的情况与一些厂矿的初步经验，确定党的保证监督范围主要包括以下五个方面：一、为实现国家生产技术财务计划而斗争，是党的基层组织实行保证和监督的中心内容。为此，党的组织要讨论厂长所提出的计划，研究执行计划中的方针步骤，掌握生产的关键问题，制订党如何保证与提高国家经济计划的具体工作计划；动员党员与全体职工为其实现而斗争。以此为中心，统一企业内党、行政、工会、青年团的思想。二、检查监督企业对上级党的政策和上级政府、上级经济机关的指示决议之执行情形，特别是关于经济核算制及劳动保护法令的贯彻情况，批评与纠正执行不力和执行中的偏向。三、保证与监督厂长负责制与管理民主化的正确实施。四、了解培养干部，协助行政正确配备干部，贯彻奖惩条例，贯彻团结技术人员与职员的政策，清查企业中的反革命分子。五、与违法乱纪、破坏政策、破坏生产劳动纪律、贪污浪费、曲解国家政策等行为及官僚主义作斗争。
    在弄清国家的计划，讨论研究本厂的具体计划和订出党如何保证的计划之后，党就要以政治工作的方法动员行政、工会、青年团中的党员定出自己的计划，带动群众、带动生产小组和车间做出竞赛计划，抓住关键，克服困难，完成和超过计划。为此，要从党内到党外，进行一系列的宣传工作与组织工作，并开展批评与自我批评，以加强党在企业中的政治思想领导。
    第三、企业中党的政治工作的基础是群众工作，群众工作主要是工会工作，因之必须搞好基层工会。在这一问题上，一、必须以发展生产为中心，充分发扬民主，用说服动员的方式，搞好生产、生活、教育三件事情。二、改进工会的组织领导，根据需要与可能逐步建立组织，反对形式主义。减少会议表格及一切不必要的文牍事务。加强地方工会对产业工会的领导，以统一步调，贯彻当前的中心工作。上级工会必须以最大的力量经常深入基层组织研究问题，解决问题，培养典型，推广先进经验。
    第四、关于地方党和政府对国营工矿企业的关系问题，总的方面有很大改进，但以下两点应予克服，即：一、地方党政机关把国家企业生产好坏视为上级经济机关的责任，自己可以不负责或少负责：二、某些国家企业的领导干部强调垂直领导，不尊重地方党政领导机关的意见及当地政府法令，不主动取得其领导与帮助。
            地方党委和地方政府
            对国营企业应负的责任
    为此，高岗除强调一切企业的领导人员应主动取得当地党委的领导和帮助，教育全体职工模范地遵守与执行当地政府的法令与各项规定外，并确定地方党委要对国营企业负如下的工作责任：一、有计划地经常地讨论及检查当地国营企业对于国家生产计划的实施，以及对国家的政策法令和上级经济机关决议指示的贯彻执行情形。二、正确地领导企业中的党的工作和群众工作，统一制定有关工厂党和群众工作的计划，统一党和群众各系统所布置的工作，统一步调，保证生产任务的完成和超过。有计划地培养与创造典型，推广典型经验。三、组织城市各方面的干部，系统地对工人阶级进行基本的革命知识的教育，组织与领导企业干部的学习，提高企业干部政策思想水平，纠正某些干部中违法乱纪、贪污腐化行为，协助上级的企业行政机关正确地选择与配备企业的干部。四、统一领导当地国营企业中的保卫工作。
    地方政府应对当地国营企业负如下责任：一、监督及检查国营企业中贯彻执行国家法令的情形，特别是关于劳动政策执行的情形。二、在市政建设上，必须贯彻为工人阶级为生产服务的观点。如在厂房、上下水道、电力、消防、住宅、道路、交通、卫生等方面，应首先照顾当地国营企业的需要。三、负责解决当地国营企业进行可能的产品推销及原料采购工作，并组织公私间的加工订货工作。
