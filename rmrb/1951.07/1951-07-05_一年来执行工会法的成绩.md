Achievements in Implementing the Trade Union Law in the Past Year

Since the promulgation of the Trade Union Law of the People's Republic of China, it has been warmly supported by the broad masses of the people, especially the working class. According to materials obtained from the labor bureaus of various provinces and cities, the implementation of the Trade Union Law has achieved considerable success in the past year.

	(I) Promoting Trade Union Construction

The Trade Union Law clarifies the nature of trade unions, enhances their prestige, and further expands and consolidates trade union organizations. Some trade union cadres said, "With the promulgation of the Trade Union Law, trade union work has a direction." Over the past year, the clear definition of the class nature and mass character of trade unions in the Trade Union Law has provided a correct direction for the development of trade union organizational work. The promulgation of the Trade Union Law has, on the one hand, made trade union organizations more pure, and on the other hand, overcome the closed-door policy of trade unions and corrected the phenomenon of trade unions being divorced from the masses. In the past, some grassroots trade union organizations in Northeast China did not regard clerks and technicians as part of the working class. Some also refused to accept odd-job workers, watchmen, and cooks as members, believing that organizing them into the union would not be of much use. Conversely, when more than 130 trade unions in Haifeng, Guangdong, recruited members, they almost invariably did not distinguish between labor and capital. In the private match industry in Jining, Shandong, three factory directors and three foremen were trade union members. These deviations have been basically corrected one by one due to the implementation of the Trade Union Law by trade unions in various places, enabling the normal development of trade union organizations. Before the promulgation of the Trade Union Law, trade union committee members in various places were often arbitrarily transferred or dismissed, which greatly affected trade union work. This phenomenon has been corrected since the promulgation of the Trade Union Law. For example, the Shanghai Public Utilities, Postal, and Transportation departments obtained the consent of the trade union before transferring trade union cadres. After the promulgation of the Trade Union Law, the grassroots trade union organizations of national state-owned enterprises and local trade unions across the country have largely resolved the issue of housing facilities, and there are no problems with large-scale private factories and mines. Only individual industrial trade unions in certain areas and trade unions in small shops and handicraft workshops still have difficulties, which need to be resolved through the joint efforts of all parties. Regarding trade union funds, the administrative departments of national state-owned enterprises across the country have basically allocated them on schedule over the past year, and most of the capitalists in large-scale private factories and mines have also paid them in accordance with the law. For example, most of the state-owned enterprises in North China have already allocated them. Almost all of the state-owned enterprises in Northeast China have allocated them, and there are very few private enterprises that have not paid. All public enterprises in Nanning and most public enterprises in Guangzhou have also allocated them on schedule. As for thorough implementation throughout the country, continuous efforts from all parties are still needed.

		(II) Helping Production Development

The Trade Union Law stipulates that in public enterprises, trade unions have the right to represent the masses of employed workers and staff in participating in production management, thereby promoting the democratization of the management system in public factories and mining enterprises, adjusting public-private relations, and thus helping the development of production. In some factories, the factory management committee used to be a formality. After studying the Trade Union Law, they were reorganized, worker cadres were selected to participate, and production plans were seriously discussed at the management committee. Many factories and mines have improved safety and health equipment and improved workers' cultural and welfare life. For example, in some factories and mines in western Liaoning, after initially studying the Trade Union Law, workers immediately launched rationalization proposals, and the administration purchased learning tools for workers or allocated funds to repair the staff and workers' club. After the administrative side of the Qiqihar Railway Factory and the trade union conducted specific research on the implementation of the Trade Union Law, they unanimously focused on production, improved labor conditions, and the material life of workers. The factory management committee of the factory also carefully handled the trade union's suggestions. Therefore, in just two months, the 5 billion Northeast currency deficit before the promulgation of the Trade Union Law was filled. Through the first congress of workers and staff representatives, the employees of the Shanghai State-Owned Cotton Textile Factory No. 19 submitted more than 400 suggestions to the administration for improving production and management. In private enterprises, where the Trade Union Law has been conscientiously implemented, labor-capital relations have been further improved, and production has been improved. For example, Hengyuan Yarn Factory in Tianjin and Shenxin Yarn Factory in Baoji have improved production efficiency through trade union organizations and have continuously created new production records. Guilin City, Guangxi, promoted the work of labor-capital consultation meetings and the signing of labor-capital collective contracts in the process of inspecting the implementation of the Trade Union Law. Many private factories and stores in Southwest China have also promoted production through trade union organizations, helping the recovery and development of the Southwest economy.

On the worker side, the promulgation of the Trade Union Law has made them more aware of their role as masters of the country. For example, some workers said, "With the Trade Union Law, the factory has become home." Many workers consciously changed their work attitude and improved labor efficiency. In the past, the number of trade union cadres who were divorced from production in some factories and mines, and the time occupied by the activities of the trade union committee, were often unlimited. After the Trade Union Law made specific provisions, this phenomenon has generally changed. Most of the cadres of trade unions in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xi'an, and other places who are divorced from production are within the prescribed scope. Most of the trade union committee members who do not leave production can also do trade union work without occupying production time.

		(III) Strengthening Labor Protection

When factories and stores in Kaifeng City, public and private enterprises in Pingyuan Province, public enterprises in Xi'an City, and most capitalists in Guangzhou City hire and dismiss workers, they can notify the trade union in advance in accordance with the Trade Union Law. Regarding the issue of guaranteeing workers' right to work, some of the cotton textile industry and brick and tile industry in Nanjing have made specific regulations or stipulated them in collective contracts. However, some capitalists emphasize management rights and do not notify the trade union when hiring and dismissing workers. There are also a few administrative departments of public enterprises that believe that this is a unified personnel allocation issue and do not act in accordance with the regulations. These are all due to the continued retention of the past practice of treating workers as those who can be "summoned when needed and dismissed at will." Most trade unions can adhere to the struggle in accordance with the provisions of the Trade Union Law. In addition, problems such as wages, working hours, safety and health, and labor insurance and welfare have been generally improved due to the implementation of the Trade Union Law. For example, Taiyuan Henghe Cotton Textile Factory once took the initiative to solve the welfare and wage issue in accordance with the Trade Union Law. After the workers carried out production competitions and overfulfilled their tasks, the capitalists took 800 jin of rice as a reward. After inspecting the implementation of the Trade Union Law, the capitalists re-repaired and washed the workers' dormitory. Due to the study of the Trade Union Law, four of the six public enterprises in Pingyuan Province were converted to a three-shift system. It can be said that the protection of workers' economic rights by the Trade Union Law has been gradually realized nationwide. After the promulgation of the Trade Union Law, workers' rights to join trade unions, the Communist Party, the Communist Youth League, and to attend various representative meetings have been basically legally guaranteed. However, due to the deep-rooted feudal oppression in the past and the management system left over from bureaucratic capital that could not be completely eradicated for a while, the political rights and human rights of the working masses are still sometimes violated. There are still serious incidents of capitalists in small and medium-sized enterprises and handicraft workshops cruelly abusing apprentices to death. There are also those who use threats and enticements to prevent workers from joining trade unions. Some capitalists have also explicitly refused to employ trade union members. There are also individual administrative departments that do not understand the nature and position of trade unions and believe that workers joining trade unions "must obtain administrative consent." These phenomena have mostly been educated, criticized, or legally sanctioned by relevant parties in accordance with the Trade Union Law and corrected in a timely manner.

		(IV) Basic Experience in Implementing the Trade Union Law

Over the past year, various localities have gained basic experience in implementing the Trade Union Law. The first is that it is necessary to universally and deeply publicize the Trade Union Law and organize the study of the Trade Union Law. Facts have proved that the Trade Union Law can be implemented wherever this can be done. For example, in Guilin City, no industry had paid trade union funds in the past, but within half a month after studying the Trade Union Law, 60% of the industries paid their trade union funds. The workers of the Chengdu 21st Factory each have a copy of the Trade Union Law and often take it out to study. After they learned that workers have the right to protest, they protested against the administrative department's delay in issuing bonuses for six months, and as a result, they were issued in three days. After Xi'an City publicized the Trade Union Law in current affairs education, the workers of some public enterprises immediately requested the establishment of a factory management committee in accordance with the Trade Union Law. The second is that the labor administrative organs and trade union organizations of various provinces and cities, and even factories and mining enterprises, must each establish a regular inspection system. This year, the labor bureaus and trade unions in various parts of the country have carried out inspections on the implementation of the Trade Union Law based on the actual situation, thereby playing a positive role in promoting enterprise administration or capitalists. For example, Shanxi inspected more than 300 problems and generally solved them in a timely manner. In Harbin, some administrative departments reviewed the past mistakes of "thinking that the Trade Union Law is a matter for the trade union" and "not relying on the trade union" to employees, and then proposed "striving to have no violations when the next inspection occurs." The working masses in the Central South region reflected that "once an inspection is carried out, all problems come out." Therefore, individual regions inspected more than twice, and each inspection resulted in an improvement in the implementation of the Trade Union Law. In individual factories and mines, such as Nanchang Zhenhua Dyeing and Weaving Factory, after inspection, the labor and capital sides both improved their understanding of the Trade Union Law. One side improved labor conditions, and the other side established labor discipline. In addition, it is even more common for individual practical problems, such as trade union housing equipment, payment of trade union funds, and notification of trade unions for hiring and dismissal, to be resolved through inspection.

### 一年来执行工会法的成绩

　　一年来执行工会法的成绩
    中华人民共和国工会法颁布后，得到全国广大人民特别是工人阶级的热烈拥护。根据各省、市劳动局所得材料来看，一年来，工会法的执行已有不少成绩。
        （一）促进了工会建设
    工会法明确了工会的性质，提高了工会的威信，工会组织进一步扩大和巩固了。有的工会干部说：“工会法一颁布，工会工作就有了路。”一年来，由于工会法明确规定了工会的阶级性与群众性，使工会组织工作有了正确的发展方向。工会法的颁布，一方面，使工会组织更加纯洁了，另一方面克服了工会的关门主义，纠正了工会脱离群众的现象。过去东北有的工会基层组织，不把职员、技术人员看成工人阶级的一部分。也有的不接受勤杂人员、更夫、厨夫等入会，认为组织他们入会的作用不大。相反的，广东海丰一百三十多个工会吸收会员时，却几乎一概不分劳资。山东济宁私营火柴业中，有三个厂长、三个把头是工会会员。这些偏差，由于各地工会对工会法的贯彻执行，才基本上得以逐一纠正，使工会组织正常发展。在工会法未颁布前，各地工会委员常被任意调动或解雇，使工会工作受到很大影响。工会法颁布后这种现象已经纠正。如上海公用事业、邮政、交通部门调动工会干部，事前都取得工会的同意。工会法颁布后，关于房屋设备，全国国营企业的工会基层组织以及地方工会大部分已获得解决，私营大型厂矿企业也无问题。只有个别地区的产业工会以及商店小手工业作坊的行业工会，尚有困难，须待各方协力解决。关于工会经费，一年来，全国国营企业的行政方面基本上已按期拨交，私营企业的资方，凡属大型厂矿，也大都依法缴纳。如华北区国营企业大部分已经拨交。东北区国营企业几已全部拨交，私营企业未缴纳的也很少。南宁的全部公营企业和广州的大部公营企业也已按期拨交。至于全国各地彻底执行，还需要各方不断努力。
            （二）帮助了生产发展
    工会法规定在公营企业中，工会有代表受雇工人、职员群众参加生产管理的权利，因此，在公营厂矿企业中促进了管理制度的民主化，调整了公私关系，从而帮助了生产的发展。有些工厂过去工厂管理委员会流于形式，在学习工会法以后进行了改组，拔选了工人干部参加，并认真在管理委员会上讨论生产计划。许多厂矿改进了安全卫生设备，改善了工人文化福利生活。如辽西的一些厂矿，初步学习工会法后，工人立即展开了合理化建议，行政上则为工人购置学习用具，或拨款修理了职工俱乐部。齐齐哈尔铁路工厂行政方面与工会对工会法执行作具体研究后，一致面向生产，改善劳动条件和工人物质生活。该厂工厂管理委员会也慎重地处理工会的建议。所以只两个月时间就把工会法未颁布前亏空的五百亿东北币填补起来。上海国营棉纺十九厂职工通过第一次职工代表会议，向行政方面提出改进生产和管理的建议就有四百多条。在私营企业中，凡认真执行了工会法的，劳资关系都得到了进一步的改善，改进了生产。如天津的恒源纱厂，宝鸡的申新纱厂都通过工会组织提高了生产效率，并不断地创造了生产新纪录。广西桂林市，在检查工会法执行的过程中，推动了劳资协商会议的工作和劳资集体合同的订立。西南也有不少私营厂、店，通过工会组织推进了生产，帮助了西南经济的恢复和发展。
    在工人方面，工会法颁布后，使他们更加提高了主人翁的思想。如有的工人说：“有了工会法，工厂成了家。”许多工人自觉地改变劳动态度，提高了劳动效率。过去有些厂矿工会脱离生产的工会干部的数额，以及工会委员会活动而占用生产的时间，往往漫无限制。自工会法作了具体规定后，这种现象一般地已改变了。上海、广州、西安等地工会脱离生产的干部大部在规定范围以内。不脱离生产的工会委员作工会工作也大多能不占用生产时间。
            （三）加强了劳动保护
    开封市各厂店、平原省公私企业、西安市公营企业、广州市大部分资方雇用与解雇工人时都能按照工会法事先通知工会。关于保障工人工作权的问题，南京棉织业、砖瓦业等有的作出具体规定或规定在集体合同中。也有不少资方强调经营管理权，雇佣与解雇工人不通知工会的。也有少数公营企业行政方面，认为这是人事上统一调配问题，不照章办事。这些都是对工人还保留过去“呼之即来，挥之即去”的积习所致。大多数工会对此，都能按工会法的规定坚持斗争。此外关于工资、工时、安全卫生、劳动保险福利等问题，由于工会法的执行，已普遍获得改进。如太原恒和棉织工厂曾按照工会法主动地解决福利工资问题。工人开展生产竞赛，超额完成任务后，资方拿八百斤米做奖励。经过检查工会法执行情形后，资方又将工人宿舍重新修理洗刷。平原省六个公营企业，由于学习了工会法，就有四个企业改为三班制。工会法对于工人经济权利的保护，可说已在全国范围内逐步实现。工会法颁布后，工人群众在加入工会、共产党、青年团，以及出席各种代表会议的权利上，已获得了基本的法律保障。但由于过去根深蒂固的封建压迫，以及官僚资本所遗留下来的管理制度一时未能铲除干净，工人群众的政治权利和人权，有时仍被侵犯。各地中小企业、手工业作坊中的资方，仍有残酷虐待学徒致死的严重事件发生。也有用威胁引诱的手段来阻止工人加入工会的。有的资方还明言拒用工会会员。也有个别行政方面，不明工会的性质及立场，认为工人加入工会“须得行政同意”，这些现象，大都已由有关方面根据工会法给以教育，批评或法律的制裁，及时纠正。
            （四）执行工会法的基本经验
    一年来，各地关于工会法的执行已取得了基本的经验。首先是必须普遍、深入地宣传工会法和组织学习工会法。事实证明，凡能这样作的地方，工会法就能够贯彻执行。如桂林市过去没有一个行业缴纳工会经费，但在学习工会法后半个月内，就有百分之六十的行业交齐工会经费。成都二十一厂工人，每人身上都有一本工会法，时常摸出来研究。他们知道工人有抗议权后，对于行政方面拖了六个月不发奖金的事就提出了抗议，结果，三天就发了。西安市在时事教育中宣传了工会法后，有的公营企业的工人立即要求根据工会法建立工厂管理委员会。其次是各省市劳动行政机关、工会组织以至厂矿企业，必须各自建立经常的检查制度。今年全国各地劳动局、工会，多依据实际情形，对工会法的执行情况作了检查，因而对企业行政方面或资方起了积极的推动作用。如山西就检查出三百多问题，而且大体都适时加以解决了。在哈尔滨，某些行政方面向职工检讨了过去“认为工会法是工会的事”“没有依靠工会”的错误，进而提出“争取下次检查时没有违法的现象”。中南区的工人群众反映“一检查，什么毛病都出来了”。因之，个别地区检查二次以上，每检查一次，在工会法的执行上，就有一次的进步。个别厂矿，如南昌的振华染织厂，经过检查后，劳资双方对工会法的认识都有提高。一方改善了劳动条件，一方建立了劳动纪律。此外，关于个别实际问题，如工会房屋设备，工会经费缴纳，雇用与解雇通知工会等由检查而解决的，更是很普遍的事。
