　　Jiang'an Railway Factory Trade Union Led the Reading Newspaper Movement
　　The Jiang'an Railway Factory Trade Union of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration's Hankou Branch used the method of cultivating typical examples and promptly promoting advanced experiences to carry out the reading newspaper movement among the workers and masses, which has achieved great results.
　　At present, the factory has established 101 newspaper reading groups and subscribed to more than 300 newspapers. All workers in the factory have participated in newspaper reading groups. Each newspaper reading group adheres to the system of reading newspapers on time every day. The number of participants in reading newspapers reached 95.1%. The results of the test in late May showed that more than 80% of the workers in the factory understood the basic principles of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and land reform, and knew how they should participate in and support these three major movements.
　　In late March, after the workers in the factory denounced the crimes of American imperialism and Japanese bandits, their political awareness generally improved, and they actively demanded to learn about current affairs. Some groups even began to read newspapers. However, when these groups' newspaper readers read the newspapers, they generally read according to the original text, which was not easy for the workers to understand, and their interest was not high. As a result, the number of people participating in reading newspapers gradually decreased. The factory trade union studied this situation and selected the first group of the foundry workshop, which had a higher enthusiasm for reading newspapers, as the key to cultivate typical examples and create experiences. With the help of the trade union, the group first changed reading newspapers to explaining newspapers, and then further changed to reading newspapers with pictures. For example, when preparing to read the news about the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, they drew on the blackboard the situation of counter-revolutionaries destroying factories and the People's Government suppressing counter-revolutionaries to explain. Sometimes they also compiled the main content of the news into clapper rhymes and sang it to everyone, making it easy for the workers to understand and arousing everyone's interest in participating in reading newspapers. As a result, not only could the workers in the first group arrive on time to listen quietly, but also the workers in other groups in the foundry workshop automatically came to the first group to listen. The trade union conducted a serious summary of the first group's experience in reading newspapers using literary and artistic forms, and held a cultural and educational meeting to introduce the group's experience. The trade union also organized 147 workshop cultural and educational committee members and group cultural and educational cadres from the entire factory to visit the group. At the same time, the factory's administrative side and the CCP branch also actively led and supported this work. For example, the administrative side gave each group a small blackboard for reading newspapers to help solve material difficulties; the CCP branch mobilized the factory's propagandists to actively assist in the newspaper reading work. Therefore, the newspaper reading movement was universally carried out throughout the factory.
　　After the newspaper reading movement was launched, the factory trade union further helped each newspaper reading group establish a newspaper reading convention. The workers guaranteed not to be late, not to leave early, to listen attentively, and to ask questions if they did not understand; the newspaper readers guaranteed to make full preparations in advance. Each newspaper reading group conducted inspections in accordance with the convention at the end of each week's review meeting. The trade union also conducted a current affairs test for the workers every month to understand the extent to which the workers understood current affairs, and helped each newspaper reading group explain difficult problems in the newspapers at any time.
　　The content of the factory workers' newspaper reading is closely integrated with the current central work, which has greatly promoted practical work. For example, Chen Bingxing, an old sand casting worker in his sixties, was initially afraid of retaliation from secret agents and did not dare to report them during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement. Later, after hearing the news in the newspaper that the People's Government resolutely suppressed counter-revolutionaries to support the workers, his concerns were eliminated, and he reported at the denunciation meeting Lu Mingjin, the organizer of the secret agent element - "Eight King Kongs" lurking in the factory. After hearing news from the newspapers about workers elsewhere using waste materials and the government calling for purchasing and storing cotton, Chen Ruoyun and Xu Denggui, workers in the machine shop, actively suggested that all workers in the machine shop collect and use the cotton yarn that had been left over in the past, so that the shop would not need to receive cotton yarn before mid-July, saving the country more than 90 kilograms of cotton yarn.

### 江岸铁路工厂工会领导的读报运动

　　江岸铁路工厂工会领导的读报运动
    郑州铁路管理局汉口分局江岸铁路工厂工会用培养典型、及时推广先进经验的方法开展职工群众的读报运动，收效很大。
    目前该厂已建立了一百零一个读报组，订了三百多份报纸。全厂工人都参加了读报组。各读报组坚持了每天按时读报的制度。参加读报的人达百分之九十五点一。五月下旬测验结果：全厂百分之八十以上的工人都明白抗美援朝、镇压反革命及土地改革的基本道理，并且知道自己应该怎样参加和支援这三大运动。
    三月下旬，该厂工人在控诉美帝国主义和日寇的罪行后，政治觉悟普遍提高，积极要求学习时事，部分小组并且开始进行读报。但这些小组的读报员在读报时一般都是根据报纸原文念，工人不易听懂，兴趣不高，参加读报的人数因之日渐减少。该厂工会研究了这一情况，即选择读报情绪较高的铸工场第一小组作重点来培养典型，创造经验。在工会的帮助下，该组首先把念报改为讲报，随后又进一步改为看画读报。如准备读镇压反革命的消息时，他们就在黑板上画出反革命分子破坏工厂及人民政府镇压反革命分子的情况，进行解释。有时他们还把新闻的主要内容编成快板唱给大家听，使工人容易听懂，引起大家参加读报的兴趣。这样一来，不仅第一小组的工人都能按时到场静听，连铸工场其他小组的工人也自动到第一小组来听。工会对第一小组运用文艺形式进行读报的经验，进行了认真的总结，并召开文教会议介绍该组经验。工会还组织全厂一百四十七个车间文教委员和小组文教干事到该组参观。同时，该厂行政方面和中共支部也积极领导和支持这一工作。如行政方面给每组发了一块读报用的小型黑板，帮助解决物质上的困难；中共支部动员全厂宣传员积极协助读报工作。因此读报运动即在全厂普遍开展起来。
    读报运动开展起来后，该厂工会又进一步帮助各读报组建立了读报公约。工人们保证做到不迟到，不早退，用心听，不懂的地方一定要问明白；读报员保证事先作充分准备。各读报组在每星期末的检讨会上都按公约进行检查。工会还每月对工人进行一次时事测验，了解工人对时事理解的程度，并随时帮助各读报组解释报纸上的疑难问题。
    该厂职工读报的内容是和当前中心工作紧密结合着的，因之对实际工作起了很大的推动作用。例如六十多岁的老翻砂工人陈炳兴，在镇压反革命运动中，起初因怕特务分子报复而不敢检举。后来从读报中听到人民政府坚决镇压反革命为工人撑腰的新闻，顾虑就消除了，在控诉会上检举出潜伏在该厂的特务分子——“八大金刚”的组织者鲁铭金。机械场工人陈若云和徐登贵从读报中听到别处工人利用废料的消息和政府号召购棉储棉的消息后，就积极建议机械场全体工人把过去残存的棉纱收集起来使用，使该场在七月中旬以前可以不领棉纱，为国家节省棉纱九十余公斤。（新华社）
