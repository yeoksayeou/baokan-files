　　People's Bank of China Headquarters Holds Private Business Meeting
    Principles Determined for National Banks' Future Private Business: Extensive Development, Deep Connection, Large Inflow and Outflow, Mutual Benefit for Public and Private.
    The National Private Business Conference held by the People's Bank of China Headquarters took place in Beijing from June 15th to 29th. The main purpose of this conference was to study and discuss how, under the current circumstances, to organize and absorb idle urban capital through businesses such as deposits, loans, and remittances, in order to support private industry and commerce and continue to consolidate the stability of finance and prices.
    The conference believes that, due to land reform and bumper harvests, the purchasing power of farmers has greatly increased. Over the past year, private industry and commerce have greatly developed under the leadership of the state-owned economy, but they are far behind the development of agricultural production and the needs of farmers. The current situation is that, on the one hand, private industries need to expand production but lack working capital; on the other hand, a portion of industrial and commercial capital is idle and not being rationally used. This has resulted in slow capital turnover and a supply-demand imbalance, hence the appearance of black market interest rates. At the same time, a significant degree of blindness still exists within the industrial and commercial sector.
    Based on the above situation, the conference determined that the principles for the national banks’ future private business are: "Extensive Development, Deep Connection, Large Inflow and Outflow, Mutual Benefit for Public and Private." The conference decided that the focus of the national banks' work in the second half of this year will be on lending, expanding loans to private industry and commerce, and vigorously supporting light industry and handicrafts needed for agricultural production and the broad masses of farmers; and helping private businesses solve capital difficulties in the production, transportation, and sales aspects of native produce exchanges. The conference decided that national banks should combine lending operations with widely signing business connection contracts with private industrial and commercial households in major cities across the country, requiring contracted households to deposit idle and intermittent funds into national banks, so that these funds can be used properly and rationally to promote the planned operation of private industry and commerce. Currently, there are more than 1,500 interbank clearing locations in major cities and 600 to 700 interbank clearing locations in small and medium-sized cities. The conference decided to comprehensively develop remittance work on this basis to facilitate the allocation of funds for private industry and commerce. National banks will also carry out long-term currency savings business in cities to replenish sources of funds and strengthen the power to support private industry and commerce.
    Hu Jingyun, Vice President of the People's Bank of China, made a summary at the conference. He pointed out that national banks vigorously developing deposit, loan, remittance, and other businesses in the private sector is to serve the legitimate operations of private industry and commerce. These three businesses must be connected and cannot be done in isolation. Future lending work must implement the principle of "Large Inflow and Outflow." If national banks release a large amount of loans, a large amount of deposits will certainly come in. With accelerated capital turnover, industry and commerce will prosper. He also pointed out that national banks leading and participating in market capital adjustment, enabling large amounts of currency to pass through the banks, will allow national banks to organize market currency circulation in a more planned manner, so that financial prices can continue to be stabilized, laying a more solid foundation for national economic construction.

　　中国人民银行总行召开私人业务会议
    确定了国家银行今后关于私人业务的原则：广泛开展，深入联系，大出大进，公私两利。
    中国人民银行总行召开的全国私人业务会议，已于六月十五日至二十九日在北京举行。这次会议的主要目的是研究和讨论在目前情况下如何通过存款、放款和汇兑等业务组织和吸收城市闲散资金，以扶植私人工商业和继续巩固金融物价的稳定。
    会议认为：由于土地改革和农产丰收，农民购买力大大提高。私营工商业一年来在国营经济的领导下已有了很大的发展，但远赶不上农业生产的发展和农民的需要。目前的情况是：一方面，私营工业需要扩大生产，但缺乏流动资金；另一方面，有一部分工商业资金在休闲着，没有得到合理使用。这样，就造成资金周转迟缓和供求失调的情况，因此市场出现了暗息。同时，目前工商业还存在着很大一部分盲目性。
    根据以上情况，会议确定了国家银行今后关于私人业务的原则是：“广泛开展，深入联系，大出大进，公私两利。”会议决定国家银行今年下半年的工作以放款为中心，扩大对私营工商业的放款，大力扶助有利于农业生产和广大农民所需要的轻工业、手工业；帮助私商解决土产交流中产、运、销各方面的资金困难问题。会议决定国家银行应结合放款工作在全国各大城市与私营工商业户广泛签订业务联系合同，要求合同户将闲散和间歇资金存入国家银行，使这些资金得到正当的合理的运用，以促使私营工商业的经营走向计划性。目前国家银行在大城市的通汇地点有一千五百处以上，中小城市通汇地点有六、七百处，会议决定在这个基础上，全面开展汇兑工作，以便利私营工商业资金的调拨。国家银行并将在城市中开展长期的货币储蓄业务，以充实资金来源，增强扶助私营工商业的力量。
    会议由中国人民银行副行长胡景沄做总结。他指出：国家银行大力开展私人方面的存款、放款、汇兑等业务，是为私营工商业的正当经营服务。这三种业务必须联系起来，不能孤立起来做。今后的放款工作必须贯彻“大出大进”的方针，国家银行有大量的放款出去，一定会有大量的存款进来。资金周转加速，工商业就会发达起来。他又指出：国家银行领导和参与市场的资金调剂，使大量的货币通过银行，国家银行即可更有计划地组织市场货币流通，使金融物价继续得到稳定，为国民经济建设打下更巩固的基础。
