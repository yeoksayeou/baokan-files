Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: As the 24th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army approaches, military organs and troops in the capital are preparing for celebrations. A "Preparations Committee for the Celebration of the 24th Anniversary of the Founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army," led by the General Political Department of the Military Commission, has been formed to oversee preparations. The committee consists of 16 members, including Wei Chuantong and Zhu Zaoguan. A grand commemoration meeting, get-together, and evening party will be held in the capital on August 1st. All military organs and troops stationed in Beijing will hold separate commemorative ceremonies.

The people of all circles in the capital are welcoming this great festival with joy and excitement. Beijing workers have prepared wonderful programs and are ready to entertain the troops at the Labor People's Cultural Palace and hold a get-together with commanders and fighters. Major universities and middle schools have invited responsible cadres or combat heroes from the troops to give reports. Student unions are actively organizing students to study the heroic struggle history of the People's Liberation Army. The capital's theater and balladry circles have prepared nearly two hundred recreational programs to comfort the troops, with thirty troupes and societies performing their best plays. All cinemas will provide free screenings for the troops. The Beijing Municipal People's Government will open all parks for the troops to visit, and literary and artistic workers from the troops will perform various artistic programs in the parks. The Beijing People's Art Theater's newly composed opera praising the People's Liberation Army's 25,000-li Long March, "The Long March," will be performed on "August 1st."

Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: In order to carry out a mass movement to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of soldiers, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has widely absorbed representatives from various democratic parties, people's organizations, social figures, and families of revolutionary martyrs, families of soldiers, and disabled soldiers to form the "Beijing Municipal People's Preferential Treatment Work Committee." This organization was officially established on July 28th, with Ma Yuhuai (Deputy Director of the Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau), Lao Junzhan (Representative of Democratic Parties), Gao Shouxin (Representative of the Federation of Industry and Commerce), and Chang Pu (Representative of the Farmers' Association) elected as chairman and vice-chairmen.

At the inaugural meeting of the "Beijing Municipal People's Preferential Treatment Work Committee," all committee members discussed some specific tasks for the near future. During the Army Day, each member will visit one to three families of revolutionary martyrs, families of soldiers, or disabled soldiers, and universally present honorary plaques to families of martyrs and families of soldiers.

Xinhua News Agency, July 27th: The units under the North China Military Region are enthusiastically preparing for various celebration activities to welcome the 24th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. All units will hold grand commemorative meetings and cadre meetings, and will conduct publicity on the history of army building on "August 1st" to strengthen the commanders' and fighters' determination to build national defense, defend the motherland, oppose aggression, and safeguard world peace. The Chahar Military Region invited veteran Red Army soldiers to a forum on the 23rd of this month to introduce the heroic deeds of the Red Army's Long March. The units under the Hebei, Shanxi, and Pingyuan Provincial Military Regions are now holding or will hold forums for heroic figures to review military training achievements, improve combat will, and exchange military training experience. Many units are compiling the history of their units' struggles. The "Red Ninth Company" of a certain unit has compiled the glorious history of its company's 22 years of combat. A certain special forces unit is compiling the history of how they developed from a guerrilla unit into a unit with modern equipment. Various military cadre schools are warmly welcoming new students participating in national defense construction, and a get-together for new and old students will be held on "August 1st" Army Day. The military region's newspaper, the North China Liberation Army Daily, and newspapers at all levels of the troops, as well as the company wall newspapers, will publish commemorative special issues.

Many heroes and models and creators of new records in the troops are reporting their advanced experiences and meritorious service plans to the leaders with unparalleled excitement. Luo Zhangyun, the current regimental commander of a certain unit who was originally a Red Army soldier, as well as Yao Fenglin and four others, along with famous militia heroes Hao Qingshan, Li Dianbing, and Li Ming, wrote letters to Chairman Mao on the eve of "August 1st" to report on their military training and learning achievements and their determination to defend the motherland.
