  A Plundering Plan That Can Never Be Completed
    The American occupation authorities in Japan will send a delegation composed of occupation officials and Japanese industrial experts to Southeast Asia next month to "develop" the region's natural resources for Japanese industry.
    What the Japanese warlords failed to accomplish in their Pacific War of aggression, the American imperialists now vainly attempt to complete. But the people of Southeast Asia, who once shattered the Japanese imperialists' plans of aggression, will certainly be able to shatter the American imperialist-made plans.
  American Warmongers Go To Great Lengths To Recruit Soldiers
    The American occupation authorities in West Germany and Austria recently closed several camps that housed German returnees from Southeast European countries who had lived there before the war. When these people were forced to have nowhere to live and no money, officials from the American recruiting offices approached them and "suggested" that they join the American army as volunteers, saying that they could obtain American citizenship after their service and find permanent jobs in the United States. As a result of such painstaking efforts, the American "recruiters" only recruited a small number of former Hitler SS personnel.
    It can be seen that it is difficult for American warmongers to collect cannon fodder at home and abroad!
  The "Good Times" of the Looters Don't Last Long
    While Iran is about to take back its oil fields from British imperialism, Lebanese newspapers are also reflecting the will of the people of that country, demanding that the properties of foreign companies in Lebanon be nationalized. They pointed out that the American Tapline Oil Company, the British Iraq Petroleum Company, the Beirut Electricity Company, the Beirut Port Company, etc., have not only plundered Lebanon's resources, but also have not paid a penny of taxes in the seven years since they were established.
    The people of the Near East are awakening, and the "good times" of imperialism's rampage and arbitrary plunder are not long-lasting.

  永远也不能完成的劫掠计划
    美国在日本的占领当局，下月将派一个由占领官员和日本工业专家组成的代表团到东南亚去，“开发”该地区的天然资源，供日本工业之用。
    日本军阀在太平洋侵略战争中没有能完成的劫掠计划，现在美帝国主义者妄想完成。但是曾经粉碎过日本帝国主义侵略计划的东南亚人民，也一定能够粉碎美帝国主义监制的计划的。
  美国战争贩子招兵煞费苦心
    美国驻西德与奥地利的占领当局最近关闭了几个供给战前居住东南欧各国的德国归侨居住的营房。当这些人被迫无处栖身，也没有钱的时候，美国招兵处的官员便找他们，“建议”他们参加美军当志愿兵，并且说：在他们服役期满后便可取得美国籍，在美国找到永久的职业。如此煞费苦心的结果，美国“兵贩子”也只招到了少数从前希特勒党卫军的人员。
    可以看出，美国战争贩子在国内外搜罗炮灰的艰难了！
  劫掠者“好景”不常
    在伊朗要从英帝国主义手中收回油田的同时，黎巴嫩的报纸也纷纷反映该国人民的意志，要求把黎巴嫩境内的外国公司的产业收归国有。它们指出：美国特拉达拉宾油管公司、英国伊拉克石油公司、贝鲁特电气公司、贝鲁特海港公司等等，不仅掠夺了黎巴嫩的资源，而且在它们成立至今七年当中，没有付过一个钱的捐税。
    近东人民已在觉醒中，帝国主义横行霸道、任意劫掠的“好景”不常了。
