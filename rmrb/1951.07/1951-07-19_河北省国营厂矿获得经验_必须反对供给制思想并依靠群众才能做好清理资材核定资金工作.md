State-Owned Factories and Mines in Hebei Province Gain Experience
　  It is Necessary to Oppose the Supply System Mentality and Rely on the Masses to Do a Good Job in Clearing Materials and Verifying Funds
    State-owned factories and mines in Hebei Province have clearly recognized in their work of clearing materials and verifying funds that it is necessary to oppose the supply system mentality and rely on the masses in order to do a good job. Although the management personnel of the state-owned factories and mines in the province generally recognize the importance of verifying funds in production management, some leading cadres in the factories and mines have not actively organized and led the verification of funds. They mistakenly felt: "We have cleared assets several times in the past, and there is nothing worth clearing this time!" Or they said: "The factory is small, and there is little to it; it doesn't matter whether we clear it or not!" Under the control of this erroneous thinking, they did not rely on all the staff and workers to do this work well, but pushed it to a few accounting staff and warehouse managers to handle. This made it impossible to accurately and reasonably verify the funds. For example, the amount of working capital verified by the Gaoyang Knitting and Dyeing Factory was 4.9 billion yuan. After the Provincial Department of Industry reviewed it, it was believed that they could reduce it by another 500 to 600 million yuan after careful calculation. When determining the inventory of materials and fuels, they did not combine the specific region, market, and transportation conditions and calculate them precisely; instead, they used twice the amount of materials and fuels used this month as the inventory. This kind of number, which is not based on last month's inventory, this month's purchase, this month's use, and this month's inventory, but is based on pure imagination, can never conform to the actual income and expenditure situation. The Gaoyang Knitting and Dyeing Factory also made a fixed amount of taxes paid to the state, and this expenditure should not occupy funds. The Gaoyang Knitting and Dyeing Factory also relied on a few ideas when verifying advance payments, and wrote down a few items. What needs to be prepaid? How are these calculations arrived at? There is no basis. Some leading cadres of state-owned factories and mines in the province also have the wrong idea of being generous when verifying funds. They feel that if the fund quota is larger, they will not be restricted in future production and operation. Because of the control of this supply system mentality, some factories and mines have over-occupied working capital. This situation shows that if state-owned factories and mines in the province want to correctly verify funds, they must seriously clear materials.
    Since the state-owned factories and mines in the province urgently need to clear assets and verify funds, they must earnestly rely on all the staff and workers to do it. When the leading cadres of the Tangshan Iron Factory cleared assets last year, they did not seriously mobilize all the staff and workers to do it, but relied on a few technicians to handle it; therefore, the clearing work was very incomplete. This time, the Tangshan Iron Factory accepted the lessons of the past and mobilized the staff and workers to participate in this work. As soon as they started to clear the materials, they found more than 7,000 jin of six-point round iron (the account stated it was 600 jin), and more than 12,000 jin of scrap iron. The warehouse managers also clearly distinguished the good and bad steel heads that they had never been able to distinguish before. The workers believed that the waste caused by using good steel heads as bad steel heads in the past was very painful. The workers recognized that the clearing work was beneficial to the country and the workers themselves, so they cleared it seriously and responsibly.
    Not only in counting materials, but also in verifying funds, it is necessary to rely on workers to achieve remarkable results. In the past, the Tangshan Paper Mill used part of its funds to make kraft paper, which was not profitable and did not sell well. When the workers saw that producing San Yu paper was profitable and sold well, they proposed to the factory management committee to sell the 200,000 jin of mulberry bark raw materials that were stored, and re-verify the funds to produce San Yu paper. This reasonable proposal has been adopted administratively and is being submitted to the Provincial Department of Industry for approval. Because the Gaoyang Knitting and Dyeing Factory only relied on a few technicians to handle it, as a result, it fabricated some relevant figures out of thin air, which did not conform to the actual income and expenditure situation, and the work of verifying funds failed.

　　河北省国营厂矿获得经验
　  必须反对供给制思想并依靠群众才能做好清理资材核定资金工作
    河北省国营厂矿在清理资材核定资金工作中，明确认识了必须反对供给制思想并依靠群众，才能做好这个工作。该省国营厂矿的经营管理人员，虽然一般地已认识到核定资金在生产管理中的重要性，可是有一部分厂矿的领导干部，还没有积极地组织和领导核定资金工作的进行。他们错误地觉得：“以往清理过好几次资产了，这回没什么值得清理的了！”或是说：“厂子小，家底少，清理不清理一样！”他们在这种错误的思想支配下，不去依靠全体职工来做好这项工作，仅是推给少数会计人员和管库人员去办。这样就使资金的核定不能做到准确合理的地步。比方高阳机染厂核定的流动资金数目是四十九亿元，经该省工业厅审核，认为他们再经过精打细算，还能减少五亿到六亿元。他们在确定材料和燃料的库存量时，不是结合具体地区、市场、交通情况，通过精确计算再来核定；而是把本月材料、燃料使用量的两倍当做库存量。这种不是根据上月库存、本月采购、本月使用和本月库存，而是凭空想像的数字，是绝不能符合实际收支情况的。高阳机染厂还把交付国家的税款也做了定额，这一笔支出是不应该占用资金的。高阳机染厂在预付款项的核定上也是凭脑子一想就写上了几笔，到底那些需要预付？这些计算是怎样来的？都没有根据。该省还有一部分国营厂矿的领导干部在核定资金时，还存在着宽打窄用的错误思想。他们觉着资金定额多一点，将来在生产经营上不会受蹩。由于在这种供给制的思想支配之下，有些厂矿曾过多地占用流动资金。这种情况说明了该省国营厂矿要想正确地核定资金，必须认真地清理资材。
    该省国营厂矿既然亟需清理资产，核定资金，那么就要认真地依靠全体职工来做。唐山市铁工厂的领导干部，在去年清理资产时，没有认真发动全体职工去做，只是靠少数技术人员办理；所以清理工作是很不彻底的。这一次唐山市铁工厂接受了过去的教训，发动职工来参加这一工作，在刚一着手清理资材时，就清查出六分元铁七千多斤（账上注着是六百斤），废铁一万二千多斤，还把管库人员从来分不清的好坏钢头，分的清清白白。工人们认为过去把好钢头当做坏钢头用，所造成的浪费是很痛心的。工人们认清了清理工作对国家和工人本身都是有利的，所以就认真负责地清理。
    不仅在清点物资上，而且在核定资金上也必须依靠工人，才能获得显著成绩。唐山市造纸厂过去把一部分资金用来做牛皮纸，又没利，销路还不好；工人们看到生产三芋纸又赚钱，又好卖，在核定资金时，向工厂管理委员会提出卖掉存着的二十万斤桑皮原料，从新核定资金出产三芋纸。这个合理建议，已被行政上采纳，正呈请该省工业厅批准执行。高阳机染厂因为只是依靠几个技术人员去办，结果，凭空捏造了一些有关数字，不符合实际收支情况，核定资金的工作遭到了失败。        （河北日报）
