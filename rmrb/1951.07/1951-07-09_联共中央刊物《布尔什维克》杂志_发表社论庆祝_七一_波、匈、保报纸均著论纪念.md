Xinhua News Agency, July 9th dispatch from Moscow: The latest issue of the Central Committee of the CPSU's theoretical journal "Bolshevik" published an editorial commemorating the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, pointing out the glorious path of the Chinese Communist Party from struggle to victory. The editorial said: The Chinese Communist Party has opened a path to socialism for the Chinese people, and its activities are based on the theory of Marxism-Leninism and the broad experience of the Bolsheviks. The historic achievements of the Chinese revolution under the leadership of the Communist Party are a new victory for the invincible doctrine of Marxism-Leninism and a brilliant testament to the international nature of Marxism-Leninism. The editorial pointed out: The heroic Chinese Communist Party greets its 30th anniversary with its significant victory. The Chinese Communists, holding high the banner of proletarian internationalism, regard the cause of China's liberation and its political and economic development as an integral part of the common struggle of all mankind against imperialism and in defense of peace, democracy, and socialism. The Soviet people wholeheartedly congratulate the Chinese people and their Communist Party on their further success in building a free and prosperous People's Republic.
