Xinhua News Agency Report: The Labor Daily published an article on the 13th introducing the large-scale construction being carried out in the Eastern European People's Democratic countries. The Labor Daily wrote: The People's Democratic countries have undergone tremendous changes. New cities and factories are springing up one after another, and canals and power stations are under construction. These countries' construction projects eloquently demonstrate the belief of millions of people in the future and in the inevitable victory of the peace and democracy camp.

    In Bulgaria's Youth City - Dimitrovgrad, entire districts of houses have successively appeared on land that was barren not long ago. The chimneys of factories and power stations are emitting thick smoke. The "Stalin" Nitrogen and Mineral Fertilizer Plant is under construction. Once completed, this factory will produce 70,000 tons of fertilizer annually.

    In Hungary, the Danube Iron and Steel Works, one of Europe's largest steel plants, has been built to a rough scale. This is the first product of Hungary's Five-Year Plan. Another huge construction project in Hungary is the Tisza River Hydropower Station and dike. This dike is about one hundred kilometers long, and when completed, it can irrigate 200,000 hectares of land.

    At the construction site of the "Nowa Huta" steel plant near Krakow in Poland, the sound of construction machinery continues day and night. The productivity of this largest Polish factory is equivalent to the productivity of the entire Polish steel industry before the war. Two hundred and ninety-six large industrial enterprises and seven hundred and twenty-seven medium-sized industrial enterprises are being built in various places. In addition, more than 20,000 villages of farmers in Poland are participating in the work of reclaiming swamps and irrigating dry areas.

    The speed of the Danube-Black Sea Canal project in Romania is increasing day by day. This canal will shorten the route from Romania to the Black Sea by 240 kilometers. The water of the Danube River will irrigate a total of 100,000 hectares of land; more than 30,000 hectares of land have now been irrigated. Another magnificent project is the "Lenin" Hydropower Station on the Bistrita River. The power generation capacity of this power station is 210,000 kilowatts, and the annual power generation is 430 million kilowatt-hours. The water stored in the reservoir near the hydropower station can irrigate nearly 300,000 hectares of farmland.

    Czechoslovakia is also engaged in large-scale construction. A huge new steel plant will be built in the northern Morava River basin. Slovakia is building dozens of industrial enterprises in accordance with the Five-Year Plan, including a large steel plant that can produce more than one million tons of steel annually, and a huge power station on the Danube River.

    In Albania, the construction projects of the huge "Stalin" Textile Factory, the "Lenin" Hydropower Station, and the Maliqi Sugar Refinery will all be completed in a few months. The factories are now starting to install equipment transported from the Soviet Union.

### 在东欧各人民民主国家内　新城市工厂接连涌现　反映了各国人民对和平胜利的信心

　　在东欧各人民民主国家内
　　新城市工厂接连涌现
　　反映了各国人民对和平胜利的信心
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：劳动报十三日发表一篇文章，介绍东欧人民民主国家进行的大规模建设。劳动报写道：各人民民主国家已经有了巨大的改变。新的城市与工厂接二连三地涌现出来，运河和动力站正在建筑中。这些国家的建筑工程雄辩地说明了千百万人民对于将来、对于和平民主阵营必获胜利的信念。
    在保加利亚青年城——季米特洛夫城，整区整区的房子已经陆续出现在不久前还是荒芜的土地上。工厂和动力站的烟囱正冒着浓烟。“斯大林”氮气与矿物肥料制造厂正在建筑着，这个工厂落成后，每年可生产七万吨肥料。
    在匈牙利，欧洲最大钢铁厂之一的多瑙河钢铁厂，已建筑得粗具规模了。这是匈牙利五年计划的第一个产物。匈牙利另一个巨大的建设工程是迪萨河的水电站与河堤。这个河堤长约一百公里，建筑完工后可用水灌溉二十万公顷的土地。
    在波兰克拉科附近的“诺瓦·胡塔”钢铁厂的建筑现场上，建筑机器的响声日夜不停。这个波兰最大工厂的生产力，相当于战前波兰全部钢铁工业的生产力。有二百九十六个大工业企业和七百二十七个中型的工业企业正在各地建设起来。此外，波兰还有两万多个村庄的农民，参加了开垦沼泽和灌溉干燥地区的工作。
    罗马尼亚开凿多瑙河——黑海运河工程的速度与日俱增。这条运河将使罗马尼亚通黑海的路程缩短二百四十公里。多瑙河的河水将灌溉共达十万公顷的土地；现在已有三万多公顷的土地得到灌溉。另一个宏伟的工程是俾斯特里查河上的“列宁”水力发电站。这个发电站的发电能力是二十一万千瓦，每年的发电量是四亿三千万千瓦时。水电站附近水库的蓄水可以灌溉将近三十万公顷的田地。
    捷克斯洛伐克也在大兴土木。在摩拉瓦河流域北部将建筑一个巨大的新钢铁厂。斯洛伐克正按照五年计划建筑数十个工业企业，其中包括每年可生产一百多万吨钢铁的大钢铁厂，和多瑙河上的巨大动力站。
    在阿尔巴尼亚，巨大的“斯大林”纺织厂、“列宁”水力发电站、以及马里库炼糖厂的建筑工程，都将在数月内完成。现在各厂正在着手安装从苏联运来的装备。
