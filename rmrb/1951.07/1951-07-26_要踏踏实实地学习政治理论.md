    Must Study Political Theory Steadily
    To the Editor:
    In our organization, many comrades have some incorrect understandings regarding the study of political theory, which greatly hinders the development of learning. I think this situation may also exist in other organizations.

    Some comrades who have newly joined the workforce, especially those who have just graduated from university, tend to overestimate their theoretical level. For example, they think that the content of the "Political Common Sense Reader" in the elementary version of "learning" is too superficial and not suitable for their "level," and they demand to study higher political theory. Therefore, they regard learning the most basic political common sense as a burden, and most of them are perfunctory, and some even emphasize that they are too busy with work to study.

    I think this is a manifestation of an ungrounded, ambitious learning attitude. They do not recognize or do not fully recognize that even if we have studied some political common sense in school in the past; however, because we did not participate in practical work at that time, our understanding of it will not be very profound. Moreover, from the time of liberation to the present stage, the study of political theory in general colleges and universities has not been systematic enough. "Starting from scratch" is especially important for us comrades who have newly joined the workforce. Studying political theory in practical work can better connect with reality and improve our professional level; if we are ambitious and unrealistic, it will greatly hinder our progress in political theory learning and greatly hinder the improvement of our professional level.

    Another group of comrades feel that their cultural level is low, which more or less affects their confidence in political theory learning. Of course, a low cultural level does make their difficulties greater. However, among these comrades, many have participated in actual struggles, and they have a strong understanding, which is a very favorable condition. Therefore, the main problem for them in learning theory is not the level of education, but "whether they have the determination." As long as they are determined and strive to improve their cultural level, they will definitely be able to learn well.

    I sincerely hope that the comrades working in the organs can carefully examine and correct their learning attitudes, increase their confidence, and study political theory steadily and step by step.

### 要踏踏实实地学习政治理论

    要踏踏实实地学习政治理论编辑同志：
    在我们机关中，有不少同志对于政治理论学习存在着一些不正确的认识，大大地妨碍了学习的开展。我想，这种情况，在其他机关也可能存在。
    有一部分新参加工作的同志，特别是新从大学里出来的同志，他们往往过高地估计了自己的理论水平。例如，他们认为“学习”初级版上的“政治常识读本”的内容太浅显，不适合自己的“程度”，要求学习更高的政治理论。因此，他们把学习最基本的政治常识当作一种负担，多数是敷衍敷衍，有的甚至强调工作忙而不去学习。
    我认为这是学习态度不踏实、好高鹜远的表现。他们不认识或不完全认识：我们纵使过去在学校里曾经学习过一些政治常识；可是，由于当时没有参加实际工作，对其理解是不会很深刻的。何况从解放后到目前这一个阶段，一般大、中学校的政治理论学习，事实上也不够系统化。“从头学起”对于我们这些新参加工作的同志来说，是特别重要的。在实际工作中学习政治理论，就能更好地联系实际，提高业务水平；要是好高鹜远，就会极大地妨碍我们政治理论学习的进步，就会极大地妨碍我们业务水平的提高。
    另有一部分同志，他们感觉自己的文化水平低，因而或多或少地影响了政治理论学习的信心。当然，文化水平低，的确会增加他们的困难。但是，在这一部分同志中，有好些是参加过实际斗争的，他们的理解力强，这是一个非常有利的条件。因此，他们学习理论的主要问题并不在于文化水平的高低，而是“有没有决心”。只要他们有决心，并努力提高自己的文化水平，一定可以学好的。
    我诚恳地希望机关工作的同志们，能好好检查并端正自己的学习态度，提高信心，踏踏实实地、按步就班地学习政治理论。
