Catholic Zhang Shunan Accuses the Crimes of Imperialist Elements in the Sisters of Charity

I am a Catholic, 38 years old this year. When I was twelve years old, because both my parents died and I could not bear the abuse of my warlord uncle, I joined the Sisters of Charity of the Catholic Church in Xishiku, Beijing, and since then I have believed in Catholicism. Who knew that escaping one fire pit would lead to jumping into another? I suffered five full years of torment in the Sisters of Charity.

When I entered the Sisters of Charity, it was hot weather, and I was wearing thin clothes. After a few months, the weather turned cold. I slept on an earthen kang [platform bed], without a quilt, still wearing only thin clothes. The person in charge of the home said that because no one from my family came to provide a written guarantee, I could not be given cotton clothes, but they also wouldn't let me go out. After countless times of kneeling and begging, I was finally given cotton clothes on Christmas Day (December 25th).

The food we ate in the home was completely spoiled. In the morning, it was a bowl of thin porridge with a lot of sand in it. At noon, everyone was given a small corn bun, which was not enough to eat. When we got sick, they didn't give us treatment, we just had to endure it, and in this way, many sisters were tortured to death.

But the food and lodging of those imperialist elements, compared to ours, was like heaven and hell! They lived in buildings and ate bread and milk. Even the dogs they raised ate beef.

When an old lady in the home died of illness, they asked me to put the corpse into the coffin by myself. How could a girl in her teens dare to do that! But they insisted that I do it alone, saying that this was establishing "merit" for God. But why didn't they want to establish merit themselves? Because they were afraid of infectious diseases. One year, when there was an epidemic, many children in the home died. They even put some children who were infected but not yet dead into coffins. I personally saw one child, still dazed, calling out "I'm scared! I'm scared!" as they were put in the coffin.

Before liberation, I often went to the home to listen to their sermons. When they preached, they often slandered the Communist Party, saying that the Communist Party was the devil Lucifer, doing evil and harming people, killing and arson. They said that anyone who believed in the Communist Party would betray Jesus, and would go to hell when the end of the world came. When Beijing was about to be liberated, I was afraid of the Communists coming in. I went to the home several times to offer money and say Mass, praying that the Communists would not come. When the People's Liberation Army entered the city, I didn't dare to go to the streets for several days. You see how deeply imperialism poisoned me!

Today, because Chairman Mao and the Communist Party have taught us, the eyes of our broad masses of Catholics are much brighter! We must eradicate the imperialist elements from Catholicism, and we must never be deceived and blinded by imperialism again.

### 天主教徒张淑南控诉  仁慈堂帝国主义分子的罪恶

　　天主教徒张淑南控诉
　  仁慈堂帝国主义分子的罪恶
    我是一个天主教徒，今年三十八岁。十二岁时，因父母双亡，忍受不住军阀叔父的虐待，投入了北京西什库天主教会仁慈堂，从此我便信了教。谁知道逃出一个火坑，又跳进一个火坑，我在仁慈堂整整受了五年折磨。
    我进仁慈堂时是热天，穿着单衣，过了几个月天气冷了。我睡在土炕上，没有被子，还是穿着一身单衣。堂里的负责人说我家里没有人来给立字据，就不能给棉衣服，可是又不叫我出门。经过多少次跪着哀求，直到耶稣圣诞节（十二月二十五日）那一天才给了我棉衣服。
    我们在堂里吃的饭坏透了，早晨是一碗稀粥，里边有很多沙子，中午每人给一个小窝头，大家都吃不饱。我们有了病，他们也不给医治，只得干挺，就这样折磨死了很多姐妹。
    可是那些帝国主义分子吃的住的和我们比起来，那才是一个天堂、一个地狱呢！她们住的是楼房，吃的是面包和牛奶。连她们养活的狗还吃牛肉。
    堂里有一位老太太病死了，她们让我一个人把尸首往棺材里装，我一个十几岁的女孩子，怎么敢装呀！可是她们非让我一个人装不可，还说这是给天主立“功劳”。但是她们自己为什么不愿立功劳呢？因为她们怕传染病。有一年闹传染病，堂里的小孩死了很多。她们还把一些染病未死的小孩装进棺材，我亲眼看到有一个小孩还迷迷糊糊的嘴里叫唤着“我害怕呀！我害怕呀！”就被装在棺材里了。
    解放以前，我常到堂里听她们讲道。她们在讲道时，就常诬蔑共产党，说共产党就是魔鬼路基扶尔，作恶害人，杀人放火。说谁要信共产党的话，就是背叛了耶稣，等到世界末日一到就得下地狱。在北京快解放时，我就害怕共产党进来，我好几次拿钱进堂作弥撒，祈求共产党不要来。解放军进城时，我好几天不敢上街。你看帝国主义对我的毒害是多么深啊！
    今天，因为毛主席共产党教导了我们，我们广大教友们的眼睛亮得多啦！我们一定要把帝国主义分子从天主教里铲除出去，我们决不能再受帝国主义的欺骗蒙蔽了。
