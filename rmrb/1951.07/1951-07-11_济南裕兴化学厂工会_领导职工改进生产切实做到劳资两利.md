Jinan Yuxing Chemical Factory Union
Leads Workers to Improve Production, Truly Achieving Labor-Management Benefits

The Jinan private Yuxing Chemical Factory's union is leading workers in implementing the policy of "developing production, benefiting both labor and management," enabling the factory to transition from handicraft production to machine production and improving workers' labor conditions.

Since its establishment in March of last year, the factory union has led all workers in carrying out the "Red May" production competition. During the competition, several old management systems were changed through labor-management consultation meetings, and a quota production system and Sunday holiday system were implemented, which greatly increased workers' enthusiasm for production. The average daily output per worker in the boiled alkali department gradually increased from 130 jin to 180 jin. After workers in the sodium sulfide reverberatory furnace suggested improving work methods, the daily output of sodium sulfide increased from 16 barrels to 18 barrels. After Red May, they immediately welcomed the peak production month of autumn. During the peak production month, the factory union actively led workers to improve production efficiency, and the boiled alkali department further divided the work into production and packaging, further increasing the average daily output per person to 300 jin. After the peak season, the output of boiled alkali had increased by 150% compared to 1949. As a result, the factory earned considerable profits last year.

The factory union correctly implemented the production-oriented policy, which relieved the management's concerns, and they decided to develop production and improve production equipment. The production equipment of the boiled alkali department was not only unable to meet the needs of production development, but also seriously harmed the health of workers. Workers were prone to eye irritation or coughing from the benzene fumes, causing them to be unable to work for two or three days. Workers had long demanded a change to these harsh working conditions, and the management also felt that handicraft production equipment could no longer further develop production. Therefore, at the seventh labor-management consultation meeting last year, labor and management reached an agreement on improving production equipment and improving labor conditions. This spring, the boiled alkali department began using five brand-new steam boilers for production.

Based on the development of production, the factory has appropriately improved the lives of workers. Since the wage adjustment last year, the income of general workers has more than doubled compared to before liberation. For example, the old technician Feng Dao-xiang received one bag of flour per month before liberation. After the wage adjustment last year, he earned 300 jin of millet (equivalent to about four bags of flour) per month (excluding meals). At the end of last year, the management also allocated 100 million yuan from the surplus to build a bathroom, barber shop, and club. Recently, five acres of land have been purchased, and construction of worker dormitories is planned to begin this autumn. In terms of hygiene, the factory conducts regular disinfection of the kitchen, dining hall, and toilets. In addition, because the factory is surrounded by many sewage ditches, and two-thirds of the workers contract malaria every year, everyone was given a mosquito net this year. There have also been many improvements in safety equipment, such as the addition of gas masks, masks, goggles, and gloves. The workers, recalling the past when their eyes were irritated by fumes and they could only let the wind blow on them, compared to the current situation where a doctor comes to check them every week, have even greater enthusiasm for production and are fully confident in further improving production during this year's peak season.

### 济南裕兴化学厂工会  领导职工改进生产切实做到劳资两利

　　济南裕兴化学厂工会
    领导职工改进生产切实做到劳资两利
    济南私营裕兴化学工厂工会领导职工贯彻“发展生产、劳资两利”的政策，使该厂从手工业生产开始改用机器生产，并改善了职工的劳动条件。
    该厂工会自去年三月成立后，即领导全体职工开展了红五月的生产竞赛。在竞赛中，通过劳资协商会议改变了若干旧的管理制度，实行定额生产和星期日休假制度，因此工人生产情绪高涨。煮青部工人平均每人日产量由一百三十斤逐渐增为一百八十斤。硫化碱反射炉的工友建议改进工作方法后，硫化碱每日产量由十六桶增为十八桶。红五月后，紧接着又迎接秋后的旺月生产。在旺月生产中，该厂工会积极领导工人提高生产效率，煮青部又将制作与包装分了工，使每人平均日产量进一步增加到三百斤。旺季过后，煮青产量已较一九四九年增加百分之一百五十。因此该厂去年获得不少盈余。
    该厂工会正确执行面向生产的方针，使资方解除了顾虑，决心发展生产，改善生产设备。该厂煮青部的生产设备，不但不能适应生产发展的需要，而且严重地妨害着工人健康。工人在工作时稍不谨慎，不是被苯锅里的烟薰坏眼睛，就是被薰得咳嗽，以致两三天不能工作。工人早就要求改变这种恶劣的劳动条件，资方也感到手工业的生产设备已不能进一步发展生产。于是，在去年第七次劳资协商会议上，劳资双方即取得了改进生产设备和改善劳动条件的协议。到今年春天，煮青部就开始用五口崭新的汽锅生产了。
    该厂在发展生产的基础上，适当地改善了工人的生活。自去年调整工资后，一般工人的收入已较解放前提高了一倍以上。如老技工冯道祥解放前每月一袋面粉，去年调整工资后，每月（除吃饭外）已赚到三百斤小米，约合四袋面粉。去年年终，资方还从盈余中拨出一亿元修建了浴室、理发室、俱乐部。最近并买妥五亩地，准备秋后动工修建职工宿舍。在卫生方面，厂方对厨房、饭厅、厕所都进行了定期的消毒，同时因该厂周围污水渠多，每年有三分之二工人要发疟疾，今年还给每人发了一架蚊帐。在安全设备方面，也有不少改进，如添设了防毒面具、口罩、眼镜、手套等。工友们想起过去眼睛被烟薰坏时只有扒着眼皮让风吹吹，而现在每礼拜有医生来检查一次的情景，生产情绪更为高涨，都有充分信心在今年的旺季里再把生产提高一步。
