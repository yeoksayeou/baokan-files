　　Cruel Exploitation
　　According to the Iranian newspaper *Keyhan*: The salaries of 1,300 British employees in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company are equal to the salaries of more than 70,000 Iranian workers.
　　For half a century, British monopoly capitalists have not only plundered the wealth of the Iranian people, but also cruelly sucked the blood and sweat of the Iranian people.

　　British Reactionaries Fear Peace
　　British reactionaries are conspiring to persecute the Very Reverend Hewlett Johnson, the Dean of Canterbury, a famous peace fighter who won the Stalin "Strengthening World Peace" International Prize. Six Conservative Members of Parliament have demanded the removal of the Dean of Canterbury from his holy office, saying that he "propagates subversive theories."
　　The famous declaration of Johnson, calling for peace and friendship between the people of all countries, has become a "subversive theory" in the eyes of the warmongers, because it wants to "subvert" their evil war plans.

　　"Unsinkable" Aircraft Carrier
　　The United States has more than 30,000 troops stationed in Britain, and they have at least 20 air bases in Britain. Recently, British newspapers reported that the United States is planning to send about 1,000 more aircraft and more than 50,000 troops to Britain, which means that not only will the existing American air bases in Britain be greatly expanded, but also many new bases will be established.
　　The British Isles have become an out-and-out "unsinkable" aircraft carrier of the United States.

  残酷的剥削
    据伊朗《基汉》报载：英伊石油公司中，一千三百个英国职员的工资和七万多名伊朗工人的工资相等。
    英国垄断资本家半世纪来不仅掠夺了伊朗人民的财富，而且残酷地吸吮着伊朗人民的血汗。
        英国反动派害怕和平
    英国反动派阴谋迫害获得斯大林“加强世界和平”国际奖金的著名和平斗士坎特伯雷副主教约翰逊。保守党下院议员六人要求撤销坎特伯雷副主教的圣职，说他“宣传颠覆性的理论”。
    约翰逊所发表的要求和平和世界各国人民友好的著名宣言，在战争贩子的眼里就成了“颠覆性的理论”了，因为它要“颠覆”他们的罪恶的战争计划。
        “不沉”的航空母舰
    美国驻在英国的军队已超过三万人，他们在英国至少已有二十个空军基地。最近英国报载，美国正打算再派大约一千架飞机以及五万余名军队到英国去，这表示不仅美国在英国现有的空军基地要大大地加以扩充，而且还要建立许多新的基地。
    英伦三岛已变为不折不扣的美国的“不沉”的航空母舰了。
