　　(I) Conscientiously Conduct Inspections of Preferential Treatment Work
In the notification issued by this association on July 4, it was requested that the people of the whole country conscientiously do a good job of providing preferential treatment to the families of all military personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the People's Liberation Army, and the families of revolutionary martyrs, and called on all cities and villages throughout the country to conduct a comprehensive and practical inspection of the status of preferential treatment and compensation work during the week before and after the "August 1st" Army Day of the People's Liberation Army this year, and to launch a mass preferential treatment campaign. This call is a concretization of the suggestion in this association's June 1st communique on doing a good job in preferential treatment work. The time is already very short before the "August 1st" Army Day, and the local branches of this association, all people's organizations, and government organs at all levels and the people of the whole country should immediately begin to arrange this work. Generally speaking, the people of the whole country, especially the people in the old liberated areas of the countryside, have a good tradition of giving preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and military personnel and respecting the families of martyrs and military personnel under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government in the long revolutionary war. This work has generally been carried out in a planned way throughout the country. However, it is necessary to conscientiously do this work regularly. For this purpose, a practical and comprehensive inspection must be carried out.

　　The main contents of the inspection should be: 1. How is the understanding and importance attached to this work by cadres and the people? Has it been regarded as a long-term political task? Have all relevant departments been mobilized to coordinate their actions? 2. Have the production and living problems of the families of martyrs, military personnel, and revolutionary disabled soldiers been resolved? How is the work of tilling the land on behalf of others in rural areas progressing? Do the families of martyrs and military personnel in cities have jobs and production avenues? 3. Have the families of martyrs and military personnel received various preferential treatments in accordance with the regulations on compensation promulgated by the Central People's Government last year? Has the problem of school enrollment and further education for the children of martyrs and military personnel been resolved? 4. Has preferential treatment work formed a mass movement? Has a social atmosphere of respecting and caring for the families of martyrs, military personnel, and revolutionary disabled soldiers been formed? 5. Have all localities and all sectors of the people included preferential treatment work as one of the contents in their patriotic covenants, and how is the degree of implementation?

　　The main methods of inspection: 1. First inspect the leadership. Provinces and cities should convene the responsible persons of the leading organs related to this work and the responsible persons of people's organizations to conduct joint inspections, in order to ensure that the leadership first attaches importance to this work. All those who have not cared about this work in the past and have not provided assistance to the families of martyrs, military personnel, and revolutionary disabled soldiers within the scope of their work should make a review, stipulate the methods for future implementation, and notify all subordinate organs to implement them. 2. Conduct a comprehensive inspection, mainly in rural townships and administrative villages, and urban districts and streets. Factories, organs, and schools should also conduct a comprehensive inspection. The purpose of conducting this inspection is to turn preferential treatment work into a genuine mass movement. To this end, it is necessary to combine the education of commemorating the "August 1st" Army Day to conduct universal publicity to the people about preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and military personnel and respecting the families of martyrs and military personnel, so that the people can understand the importance of the people's armed forces to the country and the people, and the necessity of continuing to resist the United States and aid Korea and consolidate national defense. This comprehensive inspection should be launched by the preferential treatment work committees to mobilize the masses to carry out, and preferential treatment work committees should be established in all villages or districts and streets that do not have them, and active elements from the masses should be absorbed to participate in the work. During the inspection, opinions from all parties should be listened to, especially opinions from the families of martyrs, military personnel, and revolutionary disabled soldiers. In rural areas, a competition can be organized to evaluate the work of tilling the land on behalf of others, and go to the fields to inspect the crops. 3. The leading organs should personally conduct key inspections, such as personally inspecting two or three streets and two or three villages, in order to gain experience, especially to gain experience on how to regularly do a good job in preferential treatment work in cities, so as to promote these experiences and improve the work. In order to listen to the opinions of the army, representatives from the army should be invited to participate in the key inspections. 4. Please ask the troops to help conduct side inspections, for example, you can investigate several companies to understand the family situation of the soldiers, and the preferential treatment and care of their families by the local government and people.

　　The purpose of the inspection is to improve and enhance the work. Therefore, problems should be solved in a timely manner, achievements should be commended, and shortcomings should be criticized or punished. In particular, attention should be paid to promoting good experiences, so that preferential treatment work can become a regular mass movement through inspection.

### （一）认真进行优抚工作的检查

　　（一）认真进行优抚工作的检查
    本会在七月四日发出的通知中，要求全国人民认真做好优待人民志愿军和人民解放军一切军人家属和革命烈士家属的工作，号召全国所有的城市和乡村，在今年“八一”人民解放军建军节的前后各一星期内，对优待和抚恤工作状况，作一次普遍的切实的检查，开展群众性的优抚运动。这个号召是本会六月一日文告关于做好优抚工作的建议的具体化。现在距离“八一”建军节的时间已经很短，本会各地分会、各人民团体以及各级政府机关和全国人民，应即着手布置这个工作。一般来说，全国人民，尤其老解放区农村的人民，在长期的革命战争中，在共产党和人民政府的领导之下，是有着优待烈属军属和尊敬烈属军属的良好传统的。全国各地对于这个工作一般都是有计划地进行的。但是必须经常认真地做好这个工作。为了这个目的，就必须进行切实的普遍检查。
    检查的主要内容应当是：一、干部和人民对这一工作的认识和重视程度怎样？是否已把它当作了长期的政治任务？各有关部门是否都已动员起来协同动作？二、烈属、军属和革命残废军人的生产与生活问题，已否获得解决？农村的代耕工作进行得怎样？城市烈属、军属是否都有职业和生产门路？三、烈属军属是否已按照中央人民政府去年公布的抚恤条例的规定，受到了各项优先待遇？烈士和军人的子弟入学升学问题，是否已得到解决？四、优抚工作是否已形成群众运动？尊重与爱护烈属、军属和革命残废军人的社会风气，是否业已形成？五、各地各界人民的爱国公约中，是否都已将优抚工作列为内容之一，其执行程度如何？
    检查的主要办法：一、首先检查领导，各省、市应召集与这一工作有关的领导机关负责人，和人民团体的负责人，共同进行检查，以求领导上首先对这一工作重视起来。凡过去不关心这一工作，没有在自己的业务范围内给烈属、军属和革命残废军人以帮助的，都应作出检讨，规定今后执行的办法，并通知各下级机关执行。二、进行普遍的检查，主要是在农村的乡和行政村，城市的区、街普遍进行检查。各工厂、机关、学校也要普遍作一检查。进行这种检查的目的，是为了把优抚工作变为真正的群众运动。为此，就必须结合纪念“八一”建军节的教育，向人民群众进行普遍的优抚烈属军属及尊敬烈属军属的宣传，使人民群众认识人民武装对于国家和人民的重要，继续反帝抗美巩固国防的必要。这种普遍的检查要通过优抚工作委员会来发动群众进行，凡乡村或区街没有优抚工作委员会的，应该建立起来，吸收群众中的积极分子参加工作。检查时，应该听取各方面的意见，特别是烈属、军属和革命残废军人方面的意见。在农村中并可组织代耕工作的评比竞赛，到田间去检查代耕的庄稼。三、领导机关要亲自进行重点检查，例如亲自检查二三条街、二三个村子等，借以取得经验，特别是要取得在城市中如何经常做好优抚工作的经验，以便推广这些经验，改进工作。为了听取军队的意见，进行重点检查时，应当邀请军队中的代表参加。四、请部队帮助进行侧面的检查，例如可以调查几个连队，了解战士的家庭情况，以及当地政府和人民对他们家属的优待和照顾情况等。
    检查的目的是为了改进与提高工作。因此，发现问题要及时解决，对有成绩的要表扬，对有缺点的要批评或处分，特别是要注意推广好的经验，以便通过检查使优抚工作成为经常性的群众运动。
