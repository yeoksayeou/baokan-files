In the Hometown of the Volunteers

	The People of Shuangying Village Celebrate the Heroic Achievements of Volunteer Soldiers
		"Our village's Song Fucang has performed great deeds on the Korean front!" When the good news reached Shuangying Village in Yanqing County, Chahar, the people in the streets were in an uproar. Early on the morning of July 9th, the villagers swept Fucang's yard clean, and also cleaned all the streets in the village, preparing for a celebration meeting at noon. Fucang's relatives all came, and his seventy-one-year-old uncle also came to celebrate his nephew. The glorious news of Fucang's meritorious service was spread by farmers hoeing the fields to neighboring villages, and many adults and children within three to five miles also came. Zhao Yulin from Zhaozhuangzi Village, who was fifty-seven years old, had just returned home from weeding when he heard the news. He quickly changed into a white shirt and trousers, put on new shoes and socks, and rushed eight miles to attend the celebration meeting.
		More than a thousand people came to celebrate. Some held portraits of Chairman Mao and the national flag, others carried honorary plaques, singing "The March of the Chinese People's Volunteers" and shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" The gongs and drums were sounding, the trumpets were blowing, and people hung honorary plaques on the home of the meritorious soldier, and pasted red couplets with gold borders on the door, which read: "Combat heroes are respected by everyone, and people's meritorious officials are honored for generations."
		The parents of the people's meritorious official, wearing new clothes, were adorned with large red flowers covering their chests. When they appeared, more than a thousand hands clapped loudly, expressing people's respect for them. Song Quan, the father of the people's meritorious official, said: "When I heard that my son had performed meritorious service, I smiled so much that I couldn't open my eyes or close my mouth. This glory was given by Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao educated my son, and the Chinese people educated by Chairman Mao, who joined the Volunteer Army, can all perform great deeds. I salute Chairman Mao here." As he spoke, he bowed deeply to the portrait of Chairman Mao. The mother of the meritorious soldier stared at the photograph of Chairman Mao, and she said to everyone: "My son had never been to school before, but Chairman Mao educated him well, he can write letters now, and he can fight American devils. I am so proud that he has performed great deeds, it's even more joyous than marrying a daughter-in-law!" Coincidentally, Fucang sent a letter home at this time, in which he instructed his parents to say: I am fighting the enemy bravely on the front line and making great achievements, and you must also make great achievements in production in the rear, so that our family can have "merit upon merit."
		Fan Xi, a model honorary soldier from the village, spoke at the meeting. He said: "Fucang is desperately shedding blood on the front line, defending our good life. I am an honorary soldier, and now I want to compete with him. He is fighting American imperialism on the front line, and I am increasing production and donating airplanes in the rear." Liu Shaoxian, the village head of the village, said at the meeting: Guarantee that the land of the meritorious soldier's family and all the families of martyrs and soldiers in this village will not be left uncultivated. The people who attended the meeting enthusiastically responded to the village head's call, and everyone also asked the village head to write a letter to Chairman Mao reporting the meeting.

	A Record of an Interview with Wu Yu, a Family Member of a Volunteer Soldier
		I visited Wu Yu, a family member of a meritorious volunteer soldier in Guisui City. When I arrived at Nan Chafang, it was very lively. People were setting up a stage, preparing to hold a celebration meeting. The neighbors were happily talking about Zhou Rui's meritorious service, saying, "Our Nan Chafang is so glorious, even our neighbors are glorious." I congratulated Grandpa Wu Yu, and he replied with extra energy: "This is a happy event for everyone!" Then, he proudly praised his nephew. He said: "I am already over sixty years old, and I didn't expect that this child would be so ambitious. He captured three American devils alive and seized American guns on the Korean front, and made a contribution. The good news has been sent from the Korean front all the way to home! Comrades from our People's Government have come to congratulate me and will hold a celebration meeting. I never dreamed of this glorious day before." He began to talk about family matters: "In the old society, life was really difficult. Of our family, some died and some were scattered, leaving only me and this child Zhou Rui. We suffered unspeakable sins. Since liberation, we have seen the light of day. Last winter, Zhou Rui joined the Volunteer Army and went to Korea to fight. He wrote to me saying: You old man must take good care of your health, I must make contributions on the front line. This child does what he says, he is really ambitious. He wrote in his letter: This meritorious service is the glory of the people. He wants to strive for more meritorious service."
		Then he talked about the care of the People's Government and the masses for the families of soldiers. He said: "After my child left, even more people care about me. Government workers and street cadres have come to ask me about my difficulties and help me solve them. They also send me gifts during the New Year and festivals. District Chief Chen of our Second District even came to give me gifts in person, and also hung honorary lanterns and honorary plaques at my house. Our government tries its best to help solve any difficulties of military families, and does not let go of even small problems. Our district government told the families of soldiers: 'If you want to write letters to the army, but you don't have envelopes and stationery, or you can't write yourself, as long as you find the district, we will take care of it.' The government is so good. However, we know that the government also has difficulties, so even if I have difficulties, I try to solve them myself first. I can't do anything else, but I can do a small business, earning two or three thousand yuan a day, plus the government's occasional subsidies, life is not bad. When I was sick, government comrades also took me to get treatment, often came to ask me about my condition, and also sent me food, subsidizing me with fifty catties of millet. Now, I have no more difficulties. I think, after the celebration meeting, I will tell my nephew about the glory of the family, so that he will also know that I am living better at home than he is, and I will never be alone again. Let him be more at ease on the front line and kill the enemy and make contributions."

　　在志愿军的家乡
  双营村人民为志愿军英雄庆功
    “咱村宋福仓在朝鲜前线上立大功啦！”捷报送到察哈尔延庆县双营村的时候，街上的人就哄动起来了。七月九日一早，老乡们把福仓家的院子扫得干干净净，又把全村的街道都打扫一遍，准备晌午开庆功会。福仓家的亲戚都来了，七十一岁的舅舅也给外甥来庆功。福仓立功的光荣消息，由锄地农民传到了邻村，三里五里内的大人小孩也来了不少。赵庄子村的赵玉林，五十七岁了，刚锄苗回家，听到这个消息，连忙换了一身白裤白褂，穿上新鞋新袜，一口气赶了八里地来参加庆功会。
    庆功的人到了有一千多。有的举着毛主席像和国旗，有的抬着光荣匾，唱着《中国人民志愿军战歌》，喊着“毛主席万岁”的口号。锣鼓响着，喇叭吹着，人们给功臣家挂上光荣匾，门口贴着带金边的红对联，写着：“战斗英雄人人敬，人民功臣世世荣”。
    人民功臣的父母，穿着新衣裳，带着盖满胸脯子的大朵红花。当他们出现的时候，一千多双手呱呱地拍着，表示人们对他们的敬意。人民功臣的父亲宋全说：“我听说儿子立了功，笑得眼睛也睁不开了，嘴也合不上了。这光荣是毛主席给的，毛主席教育了我的儿子，毛主席教育出来的中国人民，参加了志愿军都能立大功，我在这儿给毛主席敬礼。”说着，他向毛主席像片深深地鞠了一个躬。功臣的妈妈，不转眼地瞧着毛主席照片，她向大伙说：“我儿子原先就没念过书，毛主席把他教育好了，他会写信了，能打美国鬼子了。他立了大功我真光荣，比娶儿媳妇还大喜呢！”碰巧这时福仓给家里来了信，信里嘱咐爹娘说：我在前方杀敌立大功，您在后方生产也要立大功，叫咱家“功上加功”。
    本村模范荣誉军人范喜，在会上讲了话。他说：“福仓在前线拚命流血，保卫了咱们的好光景。我是荣誉军人，现在要跟他竞赛。他在前方打美帝国主义，我在后方增产捐飞机。”本村村长刘少先在会上表示：保证本村功臣家属和本村所有烈属军属的土地不荒一亩。到会的人热烈地响应村长的号召，大家还要求村长把开会的事写信报告毛主席。

  志愿军家属吴钰访问记
    我访问了归绥市的志愿军功臣家属吴钰。当我走到南茶坊的时候，那儿可热闹哪。人们在搭着戏台，准备开庆功大会。街坊邻居们高兴地谈论着周瑞立了功的事，都说：“咱们南茶坊可光荣了，连咱们街坊四邻都跟着光荣。”我向吴钰老大爷贺了喜，他分外有精神地回答：“这是咱们大家的喜事！”接着，他得意地夸奖着他的外甥。他说：“我现在已活到六十多岁了，没想到这孩子真有志气，在朝鲜前线活捉了三个美国鬼子还缴了美国枪，立了一功，喜报从朝鲜前线一直就送到家来啦！咱们人民政府的同志都上我这儿来贺喜，还要开庆功大会。我从前做梦也想不到这光荣的日子哪。”他谈起家常来了：“在旧社会的时候，真难生活。我们一家子人，死的死，散的散，就剩下我和周瑞这孩子，受的罪真说不完。自从解放以后，咱们才见了青天。去年冬天，周瑞参加了志愿军，到朝鲜去作战。他给我来信说：你老要好好地保重身体，我在前线，一定要立功。这孩子说到就作到，真有志气。他来信说：这次立功是人民的光荣。他还要争取更多的立功呢。”
    接着他又说到人民政府和群众对军属的关心。他说：“我这孩子走了，倒有更多的人关心我啦。政府的工作人员，街闾干部，都来问我，帮助我解决困难。过年、过节还给我送礼。咱二区陈区长还亲自来给我送礼，还给我家挂了光荣灯、光荣匾。咱们政府无论军属有什么困难都想尽办法帮助解决，就连一点小问题也不放松。咱们区政府向军属们讲：‘要有给军队去信的，没信封信纸，或者自己写不了，只要找到区上，全给办好。’政府真太好了。可是，咱知道政府也是有困难的，就是我有困难，也尽先想法自己解决。我不能做别的，还能做个小买卖，一天能赚个二、三千元，再加上政府不时的补助，生活过得不坏。当我闹病时，政府的同志还领着我去治，时常来问我，还给我送来了吃的，光小米就补助了五十斤。现在，我是再没有什么困难了。心里想，庆功大会以后，把家里的光荣情形都告诉我外甥，叫他也知道，我比他在家还生活得好，再也不会是孤孤单单的一个人了。叫他在前方更能安心，杀敌立功。”
