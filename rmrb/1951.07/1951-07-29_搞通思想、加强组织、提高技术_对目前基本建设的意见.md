　　Get Through Ideology, Strengthen Organization, Improve Technology
　  ——Opinions on Current Basic Construction
    Lecturer of the Department of Architecture, Tsinghua University, Wu Liangyong
    The People's Daily successively published the editorial "Without Correct Engineering Design, Construction is Impossible" and examples, which correctly pointed out the deviations existing in our current engineering construction. We must fully recognize the root of the errors and the crux of the problem in order to further overcome difficulties and solve problems.
    Analyzing the causes of failure in general basic construction projects, I think it can be divided into two aspects: (1) Problems exist in the individual aspects of technical personnel. (2) Problems exist in organization and systems. Of course, these two aspects cannot be completely separated and have no connection.
        Problems Existing in Technical Personnel
    I. The Work Attitude and Method of Technical Personnel - I agree with Comrade Chen Jiagong's view that this is the main key to accidents. Generally speaking, technical personnel are not working without effort, nor are they unaware of their responsibilities and tasks. From the perspective of the staff themselves, they think they are working very hard, but sometimes they unconsciously make mistakes. What is most noteworthy is that after an error occurs, it often takes a long time to analyze, or be pointed out by others, before it is "discovered" that it is an error. Why?
    We are all people who came from the old society. In terms of subjective wishes, we want to make progress, but perhaps we are usually busy with business, and we have not transformed ourselves well ideologically. Therefore, the attitude of being masters of our own affairs is not enough, and the spirit of being responsible to the people is not enough. In work, the ideas of being fond of greatness and success and "individual indulgence" exist. Sometimes, one does not have a thorough grasp of a certain technology, nor does one make precise research. Or, one only pays attention to objective difficulties, knowing that it should not be done this way, but in order to cater to the requirements of the client, one does not make subjective efforts on what should be insisted on. This "employment" point of view still exists, so when the task is urgent, there will be more or less the idea of simply "completing the task." Because of the lack of technical personnel, if something is not going smoothly in one's job position, the idea of "stay if it suits you, leave if it doesn't" may sometimes prevail... Irresponsible work, lack of planning, lack of a pragmatic scientific spirit, and conceited ideas all start from the same aspect. If there are incorrect tendencies in thinking, even highly skilled personnel cannot play a positive role; those with poor technical skills will naturally cause more trouble.
    To overcome this deviation, we can only carry out ideological transformation more actively, cooperate with work, learn more politics, and earnestly study Marxism-Leninism - Mao Zedong Thought; gradually overcome the various defects existing in our thinking and personal consciousness that hinder work in our work. Once the ideology is improved, the technology will certainly improve accordingly. Of course, this ideological transformation is a long-term struggle, but we must work hard ourselves.
    II. Technical Level - Due to insufficient theoretical knowledge or lack of practical experience, the losses caused in this area are not small. Many "accidents" and "problems" that have already occurred are easily detected by ordinary people; but there are also many invisible wastes that are not easy to detect immediately. Although it is impossible to count, I think this number is also considerable. For example, in order to avoid liability accidents, the safety factor is calculated too much due to the lack of technical certainty, and all dimensions are increased without principle, and the steel bars are added more. For example, although a building has been built and has not collapsed, if it is carefully designed and considered, and the layout is more precise, more useful space can be spared, and it is more practical. For example, in terms of structure, there are several ways to solve the same problem, but there must be one that is the most economical and most in line with the local conditions. Choosing the right one can also save a lot. The waste caused by insufficient technical capabilities is invisible, but it must be paid attention to.
    Although the level of technology needs to be improved slowly, the business learning of technical personnel can be improved faster through the exchange of experience and mutual assistance. After the completion of each project, it must be summarized. Where was the success? Where was the failure? It is best to sort out and publish the main points so that colleagues can absorb advanced experience and avoid similar mistakes. If a project fails completely, we should not hide it! When necessary, it is best to invite experts and colleagues to study and analyze the problem more widely and publish the research results. Because the project has failed, the people's millet has been wasted anyway; but the waste can be compensated and play a part by increasing experience and promoting understanding from the failure.
  Problems Existing in Organization and Systems
    I. Unsound Organization of Work Institutions - The lack of technical personnel and the shortage of manpower is a common phenomenon. At present, in general, government departments have established basic engineering offices and public and private construction companies of varying sizes to meet actual needs. This is a dispersion of manpower. Every unit is short of people, and the promotion of projects is naturally difficult. Of course, it is impossible to talk about the planned unification of engineering standards, and it is even more difficult to approach the style of architecture.
    II. The Imperfect Organization of Construction Workers - Construction workers have not been fully organized; the feudal remnants of the foreman system have not been eliminated; the contracting system is unreasonable after all. This issue has been discussed in the newspaper, so I will not repeat it here.
    III. Lack of Comprehensive Planning - I have been in contact with some units that want to build houses, and they have allocated several acres of land. Sometimes the geographical conditions are very good. They plan to build offices, dormitories, residences, auditoriums, playgrounds, kindergartens, elementary schools, etc. This is like a small town unit! Coordinating with the entire urban construction, this large-scale "site design", from surveying the terrain to the design of the "master plan", the problem of water supply and drainage, the connection of roads, the arrangement of buildings, is a rather complicated problem. However, some leading cadres do not seem to pay much attention to this aspect. Sometimes, in order to rush to make a budget, they find an engineer to draw a drawing and report it in a very short period of time. Sometimes, there is no "master plan" at all. When it is approved, they find a location on a piece of land and build it. If they want to build a house in the future, they find another location and build it again. This often leads to problems such as improper selection of building sites, inconvenient transportation, increased unnecessary auxiliary facilities, and difficulties in future development. At the same time, there is a lack of contact between the various construction units, and they are not in harmony with the development of the entire city.
  How Should the Problems Be Solved?
    Undeniably, the problems in basic construction are more than just these. In order to overcome difficulties in a planned and step-by-step manner, I believe that a unified leadership institution should be established to undertake the following tasks:
  I. Unified Leadership of Urban Construction Planning and Design
    The construction of large and medium-sized cities should be strengthened in planning. After a specialized agency is established to provide unified leadership, it can guide the local authorities in investigation and research, and formulate the "general plan" of the town in the direction of urban development. All local constructions, the development of various districts, the design of various units in the city, the construction of road systems, garden systems, the construction of buildings, and the demarcation of reserved areas can all be implemented according to the established plan of the "general plan." In this way, the city can avoid "spontaneous" development, and at the same time, the priorities of construction in various aspects can be coordinated, so that the road will not be dug up again to install water pipes as soon as it is repaired, and the house will be demolished shortly after it is built, so that waste will not occur because the work in various aspects is not connected.
  II. Leading and Organizing Sound Construction Organizations
    The bidding and contracting of projects, and the price comparison system, are quite considerable in terms of waste in manpower and materials. We still need to explore and establish a construction organization, system and method that is more perfect than the current one, and can truly cooperate closely with the planning and design institutions. At the same time, we should strive to improve the technical level of workers, concentrate on supplying modern construction machinery and equipment to improve work efficiency.
  III. Leading Technical Research and Improvement
    Most of the "new technologies" in basic construction today are learned directly or indirectly from abroad. This knowledge is sometimes not completely systematic, or all of it has been tested in practice; there is not much exchange of experience, and even less work is done in comprehensive research and criticism. As for the ancient construction methods of our country and the "native methods" used everywhere, they are all the creations of our working people, and the accumulated experience and achievements over a long period of time. For example, the construction method of hollow walls has very strong heat insulation performance. We have used it in the south for many years, but an architect in the United States has only recently claimed to have "invented" it. There are many such examples. Unfortunately, in the past reactionary government era, indulging in Western technology, we never knew how to value the heritage of our great motherland, let alone analyze, criticize, improve and promote the advantages of these technologies. Other work such as the testing of various domestic materials, the formulation of engineering standards, and the unification of special nouns and terms has not been done in a planned and systematic manner. With the large-scale development of our country's light industry, many by-products can be studied and used to manufacture building materials. Another example is the cinder that can be seen everywhere. As long as there is simple mechanical equipment, it can be made into cinder bricks with good performance. A certain construction office has achieved good results by manually hammering them. However, all these tasks require a specialized agency to lead and promote them.
  IV. Planning the Production, Transportation and Distribution of Building Materials
    Engineering planning and construction must be coordinated with the production and transportation of materials, otherwise it will affect the realization of the plan. For example, this year Beijing originally planned to build tens of thousands of houses in total, but for a period of time, the supply of wood, bricks, stone, and skilled workers could not keep up, thus delaying the realization of the plan. Therefore, the production, transportation and distribution of building materials should be controlled in a unified manner. This can not only increase production in a planned manner, but also directly cooperate with the actual design and construction requirements, and can absorb the achievements of technical research at any time to improve production.
  V. Guiding the Training of Technical Cadres
    In order to coordinate the theory of school education with practice, the Central Ministry of Education issued instructions in July 1950 in the decision on the implementation of curriculum reform in colleges and universities, instructing all colleges and universities to establish close ties with government business departments and their affiliated enterprises and institutions. This is of course of great significance; theory must start from practice, and the architectural departments of various universities are no exception. Otherwise, if you build a car behind closed doors, the students trained cannot quickly take on practical tasks. Therefore, the architectural departments of various schools are very hopeful to establish contact with relevant departments. There are too many departments that can establish relationships with the architectural departments, but at present, there is no institution that has the capacity to pay attention to the development of the architectural departments of various universities and provide opinions on teaching methods and curriculum content. This year, the number of graduates from architectural departments across the country is estimated to be less than sixty, while the number of architectural personnel needed by various agencies is far greater than this. Why doesn't every university's architectural department hope to expand and recruit more freshmen in order to meet current needs, but in a comprehensive university, in order to take care of the overall situation, teachers, equipment, classrooms, and student dormitories are all restricted. This summer, the building group and the urban planning group of the Department of Construction of Tsinghua University can only recruit fifty students in total. This is already the largest class in terms of the number of students in the past years. Just imagine, four years later, when this group of students graduates, it will be the time when our country is engaged in construction on a larger scale. There are too few people! Not enough! I suggest using teachers and equipment more centrally in order to cultivate the new force of basic construction more effectively and in greater numbers.
        ★            ★          ★
    Basic construction is the beginning of all construction. Our responsibility and task is significant. Undeniably, there are many objective difficulties in the current stage, but solving the problem still depends on our own efforts. "Get through ideology, improve technology, and strengthen organization" should be our current guide to action.

　　搞通思想、加强组织、提高技术
　  ——对目前基本建设的意见
    清华大学营建系讲师　吴良镛
    人民日报连接登载了《没有正确的工程设计，就不可能施工》的社论和例证，正确地指出了我们工程建设目前所存在的偏向。我们必须充分认识错误的根源和问题的症结，才能进一步的克服困难，解决问题。
    试分析一般基本建设工程失败的原因，我觉得可以分两方面，（一）问题存在于技术人员的个人方面。（二）问题存在于组织、制度方面。当然这两方面并不是可以完全截然划分而毫无联系的。
        存在于技术人员方面的问题
    一、技术人员的工作态度和方法问题——我同意陈家珖同志的看法，这是发生事故的主要关键。一般说来，技术人员的工作并非不努力，也不是不知道自己的责任和任务。在工作人员本身看起来，自以为是挺卖劲的，但有时不自觉地却犯了错误。最值得注意的是错误发生后，往往须经过长时间的分析，或由别人指明，才“发现”这是错误。为什么呢？
    我们都是旧社会过来的人，在主观的愿望上是要求进步的，但平时也许忙于业务，在思想上并没有把自己改造得很好，因此主人翁的态度不够，对人民负责的精神不够。在工作上，好大喜功，“个人过瘾主义”的思想存在着。有时对某一种技术掌握的并不透彻，也没有作精密的钻研。或者只理会到客观的困难，知道不应该这样办，但为迎合委托者的要求，对于应该坚持的事，并未做主观的努力。这种“雇佣”观点还存在着，因此在任务紧急时，便又或多或少的就有单纯为了“完成任务”的想法。因为技术人员的缺乏，自己工作岗位上有什么事不顺手，“合则留，不合则去”的思想有时也会作祟……。工作不够负责，无计划性，缺少实事求是的科学精神，和自高自大等思想，都是从同一方面出发的。思想上有了不正确的倾向，即使有高明技术的人员，也不能发挥积极作用；技术水平差的，自然更会出乱子。
    克服这种偏差，只有我们自己更积极地进行思想改造，配合着工作，更多学习政治，认真地学习马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想；在工作中逐步克服思想上所存在的种种缺陷，和妨碍工作的个人意识。思想上提高了一步，技术上一定也会随着提高。当然，这种思想改造是长期的斗争，但我们自己必须努力。
    二、技术水平问题——由于理论知识的不够或实践的经验的缺乏，在这一方面所造成的损失也并不很小。有许多已经发生的“事故”和“毛病”，容易为一般人所发觉；但还有许多不易立刻发现的浪费，虽然无从统计，我想这一个数目也相当可观。例如，为了避免责任事故，技术上没有把握，便过多地计算了安全率，将一切尺寸无原则地加大，将钢筋加多。又如一幢建筑虽然盖了起来并未垮，但如果经过精密的设计推敲，平面布局精密些，可以匀出更多有用的空间，而且更合乎实用。又如在结构方面，有好几种做法可以解决同样的问题，但必有一种是最经济最合乎所在地的条件的，选择的恰当也可以节省很多。因技术能力不及而造成的浪费是无形的，但也不能不加以注意。
    技术的水平虽然要慢慢地提高，但技术人员的业务学习可以经过交流经验彼此帮助而进步得更快。每一项工程完工后，一定要加以总结，成功在什么地方？失败在什么地方？最好能择要整理发表，使同行工作人员吸取先进的经验，避免类似的错误。如果一件工程完全失败了，我们更不应该隐瞒！必要时最好能更广泛地约请专家及同业人员研究分析这个问题，将研究结果公布。因为工程失败了，反正已经浪费了人民的小米；但从失败中增进了经验，推广了认识，这种浪费也可得到一些补偿，起一部分的作用。
  存在于组织制度方面的问题
    一、工作机构组织不健全——技术人员缺乏，人手不足，已是一个普遍现象。目前一般情形，各政府机关部门，为了配合实际需要，各自成立了大小不一的基本工程处和公私营建筑公司之类。这样在人力上是分散的，每一个单位都缺人，工程的推动自然吃力，当然谈不上工程标准有计划地走向统一，建筑的式样方面更难接近。
    二、建筑工人组织的不健全——建筑工人还没有完全组织起来；封建残余的把头制度，并未肃清；包工制度，究竟是不合理的。对这问题，报上已有讨论，兹不赘述。
    三、缺少全面性的计划——我接触到有些单位要建筑房舍，划得了若干亩地，有时地理的条件很好，他们要计划建造办公室、宿舍、住宅、礼堂、游戏场、幼稚园、小学校等。这俨然是一个小的市镇单位！配合着整个的城市建设，这种规模宏大的“地盘设计”，从勘察地形到“总图”的设计，给水排水的问题，道路的联系，建筑物的安排，这是一个相当复杂的问题。而有些领导干部对这方面似乎并不太注意，有时为了赶作预算，在极短时期内找一位工程师画一份图样报上去，有时竟连“总图”都没有，等到批准了，就在一片地上找了一个位置盖起来；以后要盖房子，再找个位置再盖。这样就常常形成建筑地址选择不当、交通不便、不必要的附属设备加大、将来的发展困难等问题。同时各建筑单位间彼此又缺乏连系，和整个城市的发展也不相谐调。
  问题应该怎样解决？
    无可否认的，基本建设中所存在的问题，不止是上述的这一些。为了能有计划有步骤地克服困难，我认为应成立统一领导的机构，担负以下的任务：
  一、统一领导城市建设的规划和设计
    各大中型城市的建设，应当加强计划性。有了专门的机构统一领导后，可以辅导地方当局调查研究，针对着城市发展的方向，拟定该市镇的“计划总图”。一切局部的建设，各区的发展，城市中各个单位的设计，道路系统、园林系统的建设，建筑物的兴建，保留地带的划定，均可循着“总图”既定的计划去实施。这样便可以使城市避免“自流”的发展，同时各方面建设的轻重缓急，也借此取得配合，不会刚修好马路又挖开装水管，盖了房子不久又要拆去，不至于因为各方面工作不相衔接而发生浪费。
  二、领导组织健全的施工机构
    工程的招包承包，比价制度，在人力物力上的浪费是相当可观的。我们还需要摸索，建立一种比现在更完善的施工组织、制度和方法，真正地能和计划设计机构密切配合。同时并努力提高工人的技术水平，集中供应现代化的施工机械设备，以提高工作效率。
  三、领导技术的研究和改进
    现在基本建设中的一些“新技术”大都是直接间接从国外学来的。这些知识，有时也并不是完全有系统，或全部经过实践的考验；经验的交流既不多，全面的研究和批判的工作做得更少。至于本国古代的营造方法，及现存各地使用的“土做法”，都是我们劳动人民的创造，长时期累积了的经验和成就，例如空斗墙的砌法，它的防热性能是很强的，我们南方不知用了多少年，但美国的某建筑师到最近才号称“发明”。这种例子很多，可惜在过去反动政府时代，沉溺于西洋的技术，一直对我们伟大祖国的遗产不知道重视，更谈不上分析、批判、提高和发扬这种种技术的优点。其他如各种国产材料的试验，工程标准的制定，专用名词术语的统一工作，都还没有有计划有系统的做过。随着我国轻工业的大规模发展，好多副产品是即可加以研究用来制造建筑材料的。又如到处可见的煤渣，只要有简单的机械设备，可以制成性能很好的煤渣砖，某修建办事处曾用人工捶制，已有很好的成绩。但这种种的工作，都需要有专门的机构来领导和推动。
  四、筹划建筑器材的生产、运输和分配
    工程计划和施工，一定要和器材的生产运输配合，否则对计划的实现是有影响的。例如今年北京原有计划总共要盖数万间房子，但有一个时期木料、砖石、技术工人都供应不上，因此使计划的实现拖延。所以建筑器材的生产、运输和分配，应当统一掌握。这样不但可以有计划地增产，同时可以直接配合实际设计施工的要求，并可随时吸取技术研究的成就以改进生产。
  五、辅导技术干部的训练
    中央教育部为了要使学校教育的理论与实际配合，曾于一九五○年七月在关于实施高等学校课程改革的决定上，指示各高等学校应与政府各业务部门及其所属的企业和机关，建立密切的联系。这当然是有重大意义的；理论必须从实际出发，各大学的建筑系更不能例外。否则闭门造车，训练出来的同学，不能很快地担负实际的任务。因此，各校的建筑系都很希望和有关部门取得联系。可以和建筑系建立关系的部门太多了，但目前还没有一个机构，有余力注意到各大学建筑学系的发展问题，提供教学方法和课程内容的意见。今年全国建筑系的毕业生有人估计不会满六十人，而各机关需要的建筑人员却远胜于此。每一个大学的建筑系何尝不希望为了配合目前需要，加以扩充，多招收新生，但在一个综合性的大学内，为了照顾全面，师资、设备、教室、学生宿舍等都受限制的，今年暑假清华大学营建系建筑组，市镇计划组合起来只能招收五十学生，这已经是历年以来学生人数最多的一班了，试想四年以后，这一批学生毕业出来，正逢到我们国家更大规模从事建设的时候，人太少了！太不够用了！我建议更集中地使用师资和设备，以便更有效地更多地培养基本建设的生力军。
        ★            ★          ★
    基本建设是一切建设的开端，我们的责任和任务是重大的，无可否认，在现阶段中存在了不少客观的困难事实，但解决问题的还是要靠我们自己的努力。“搞通思想，提高技术，加强组织”应该做为我们目前行动的指南。
