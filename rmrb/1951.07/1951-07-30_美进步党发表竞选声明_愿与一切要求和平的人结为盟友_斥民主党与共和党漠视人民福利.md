Xinhua News Agency, New York, 27th (TASS dispatch): The American Progressive Party announced that its National Committee will hold a special meeting in mid-August to discuss the 1952 election plan. The statement pointed out that the Korean armistice negotiations have aroused new hope, saying: "A wave of courageous advancement is surging among the people of all countries, and new changes have begun in all camps. The Democratic government in Washington completely lacks human moral values. The Republican leadership also disregards peace or the welfare of the people, and is impatiently waiting for the opportunity to seize power.
    The two old parties are already competing for position in 1952. The Democratic Party is busy dressing up Truman in new clothes as a "peace candidate," while the Republican Party is formulating its platform, half McCarthyism and half MacArthurism.
    Newspapers are speculating about Truman of the Democratic Party, Taft of the Republican Party, or Eisenhower, who is either Republican, Democratic, or both. But neither Truman, Taft, nor Eisenhower will put forward a program of peace, security, and freedom. Our party firmly believes that 1952 will be the time for our people to fight by voting to support national candidates who are committed to true peace, a welfare economy, the complete restoration of the Bill of Rights, and complete equality for black people. We are willing to ally ourselves with people from all walks of life—with the millions of workers who have seen deceptive price controls and vicious wage freezes, with the black people who have been cruelly betrayed by the two old parties, with the educators who see academic freedom gradually disappearing, with all those who see the entire economy increasingly turning to war, thereby lowering their living standards, and with all who demand peace."

　　美进步党发表竞选声明
　  愿与一切要求和平的人结为盟友
　  斥民主党与共和党漠视人民福利
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十七日讯：美国进步党宣布，该党全国委员会将于八月中旬举行特别会议，讨论一九五二年的竞选计划。声明在指出朝鲜停火休战谈判引起了新的希望后说：“各国人民中涌起了奋勇前进的浪潮，各方阵容已开始新的变化。华盛顿的民主党政府完全没有人类的道义价值。共和党领导机构也同样漠视和平或人民的福利，而在急不可耐地伺机夺取政府大权。
    两个老政党已经在争夺一九五二年的地位。民主党正在忙成一团，用新衣服把杜鲁门打扮成“和平候选人”，而共和党则在制订他们的麦克锡主义和麦克阿瑟主义各占一半的纲领。
    各报纷纷猜测，想到民主党的杜鲁门，想到共和党的塔夫脱，或者想到不是共和党就是民主党或同属两党的艾森豪威尔。但是，不论杜鲁门、塔夫脱还是艾森豪威尔，都一样不会提出和平、安全和自由的纲领。我党坚决认为，一九五二年必将是我国人民用投票方式进行斗争，以拥护那致力于真正和平、福利经济，致力于完全恢复权利法案及黑人的完全平等的全国候选人的时机。我们愿与一切阶层人民结为盟友——与千百万曾经看到骗人的物价管制和邪恶的工资冻结的劳动者，与曾经被两个老政党残酷地出卖的黑人，与看到学术自由在日渐消失的教育家，与一切看到了整个经济日益转向战争从而使他们的生活水准日益低落的人们，与一切要求和平的人，结为盟友。
