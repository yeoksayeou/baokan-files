The Resist America, Aid Korea Movement in Liaodong Province

As of June 15th, in Liaodong Province, over 5,980,000 people signed the declaration regarding the conclusion of a peace treaty, accounting for 70.3% of the province's total population. Over 5,990,000 people voted against the United States rearming Japan, accounting for 70.5% of the province's total population.

According to statistics from 23 cities and counties, over 2,340,000 people participated in accusation meetings, accounting for 43% of the province's population.

Guangxi Province Continues to Popularize the Patriotic Movement

After the Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda work and the "May 1st" grand demonstration in late April, the patriotic education reached 90% of the people in cities and basically eliminated "blank areas" in Guangxi Province; it reached 50% in rural areas. Before "May 1st," accusation meetings were generally held in various places, with a total of over 950,000 people participating. The number of people participating in the "May 1st" grand demonstration in various places is estimated to be over 60%. More than five million people signed in support of concluding a peace treaty and voted against the United States arming Japan. The movement has greatly promoted the production competition of workers and farmers. According to statistics in mid-June, among the 111 public and private factories and mines in the province, 64 units participated in the Ma Hengchang group competition, and most achieved significant results. Most rural areas have formulated patriotic pacts and production plans. For example, in the Guilin Special Zone, 481 villages formulated patriotic pacts and production plans. The patriotic movement in Guangxi Province is still very poor in rural areas, and 50% of the population has not received patriotic education. Therefore, the provincial leadership decided to continue to carry out universal propaganda in conjunction with the central work of the region before "July 1st" to eliminate "blank areas."

Experience of Ningxia Province in Carrying Out the Patriotic Movement

As of "May 1st," over 80% of the people in towns and cities and 60% to 70% in rural areas in Ningxia Province had received Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic education. People from all ethnic groups and walks of life in the province widely formulated patriotic pacts, which generally achieved good results.

A notable experience of Ningxia Province in carrying out the Resist America, Aid Korea movement is to carry out propaganda work among brotherly ethnic groups through various social forces. For the Hui people, propaganda was first carried out to Ahongs and religious leaders, and then Hui cadres were organized to carry out propaganda to the masses. For the propaganda of the scattered Mongolian people, training cadres is the main key to carrying out the work. At the same time, the principles of Resist America, Aid Korea were conveyed to all Mongolian yurts through some institutions or individuals with prestige among the Mongolian people, such as security teams, medical teams, trade companies, and salt bureaus, taking advantage of their work, which achieved considerable results in coordinating the propaganda work of the Mongolian people. In addition, the propaganda system of dividing regions and assigning responsibilities, holding accusation meetings, conducting propaganda through welcome meetings for volunteers going to Korea, public security exhibitions, and various art forms such as Yangko, dramas, pictorials, foreign films, and propaganda trucks, holding small meetings, and talking heart-to-heart with the masses door-to-door, also achieved great propaganda results.

  辽东省的抗美援朝运动
    辽东省的抗美援朝运动，截至六月十五日止，全省人民在关于缔结和平公约宣言上签名的有五百九十八万余名，占全省总人口百分之七十点三。反对美国重新武装日本投票的有五百九十九万余名，占全省总人口百分之七十点五。参加“五一”大示威的达三百七十九万余人，约占全省总人口百分之五十。参加控诉会的，据二十三个市县统计，有二百三十四万余人，占全省人口百分之四十三。
  广西省继续普及爱国运动
    经过四月下旬抗美援朝宣传工作和“五一”大示威，广西省人民受到爱国教育的，在城市中已达到百分之九十，“空白区”已基本消灭；在农村中已达百分之五十。“五一”前各地普遍开了控诉会，与会人数共九十五万余人。各地参加“五一”大示威的人数，估计在百分之六十以上。签名拥护缔结和平公约和投票反对美国武装日本均在五百万人以上。运动对推动工人、农民的生产竞赛起了很大作用。据六月中旬统计，全省一百一十一个公私营厂矿中，参加马恒昌小组竞赛的有六十四个单位，多数获得显著的成绩。大部分农村都订了爱国公约和生产计划。如桂林专区就有四百八十一个村订了爱国公约和生产计划。广西省的爱国运动，在农村开展得还很差，尚有百分之五十的人口未受到爱国教育。因此，该省领导机关曾决定在“七一”以前，继续结合本区中心工作进行普遍宣传，来消灭“空白区”。
        宁夏省开展爱国运动的经验
    截至“五一”止，宁夏省人民受到抗美援朝爱国教育的，在城镇已超过百分之八十，在乡村也达到百分之六十至七十。全省各族各界人民广泛地订立了爱国公约，一般都收到很好效果。
    宁夏省开展抗美援朝运动的特出的经验是通过各种社会力量，开展兄弟民族的宣传工作。对回民群众，先向阿訇教长进行宣传，然后组织回民干部，向群众宣传。对分散的蒙民宣传，训练干部是开展工作的主要关键。同时，通过一些在蒙民中有威信的机关或个人，如通过保安队、医疗队、贸易公司、盐务局等，趁工作之便，将抗美援朝的道理传达到所有蒙古包等，对配合开展蒙民宣传工作，收到相当大的效果。此外，如划分地区分工负责的宣传制度，召开控诉会，通过欢送赴朝壮士会、公安展览会与秧歌、戏剧、画报、洋片、宣传卡车等各种艺术形式进行宣传，召开小型会议及挨门逐户和群众谈心等，也收到了很大的宣传效果。
