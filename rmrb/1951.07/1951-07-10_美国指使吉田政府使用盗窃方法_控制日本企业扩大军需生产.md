Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch from Tokyo:

　　American imperialism is using various means to extensively utilize Japanese factory equipment for military production. The Yoshida reactionary government, in order to avoid criticism from international public opinion, has recently accepted US orders for arms production in Japan under the guise of "private manufacturers undertaking" and other deceptive methods. Former army and navy factories that have been designated as reparations are being transferred to the hands of US-Japanese monopoly capital through theft methods such as "bidding" and "temporary use." Tokyo Broadcasting reported on June 27 that in May alone, there were 44 cases of foreign capital entering Japan, of which the United States accounted for 40. According to the Asahi Shimbun, the situation of former army and navy factories being "bid off" is as follows: Tomakomai Paper Co. acquired the Torii Matsu factory of the former Army Arsenal in Aichi Prefecture, Kobe Steel acquired the Chofu factory in Yamaguchi Prefecture, Xingguo Rayon Co. acquired the Saeki factory in Oita Prefecture, and American Bulk Transport Co. and Nisshin Steel Manufacturing Co. were permitted to "temporarily use" the former Navy Kure Port factory. Applications are also pending for: Nippon Mining Co. and Daikyo Oil and other companies applying to acquire the former Navy Yokkaichi Fuel Plant, Kobe Steel and Takasago Heavy Industries Co. applying to acquire the Takasago Factory in Hyogo Prefecture, Nippo Chemical Co. applying to acquire the former Army Fuel Plant Iwakuni Factory, Showa Oil and other companies applying to acquire the former Navy Fuel Plant Tokuyama Factory, and Tokuyama Iron Plate Co. applying to acquire the former Navy "Hikari" factory in Yamaguchi Prefecture.

　　According to Kyodo News Agency, in order to accelerate military production, US monopoly capital is also stepping up the annexation of Japanese monopoly enterprises. For example, Central Japan Heavy Industries Co. is conducting "cooperation" with American Jeep manufacturer Willis-Overland Co. Willis-Overland Co. will establish a new company in Japan to supply Central Japan Heavy Industries Co. with automotive mechanical parts to assemble complete vehicles. It is planned to produce 200 vehicles per month, and equipment will continue to be expanded to increase production. The vehicles produced will be transported by the new company to Southeast Asia for the use of invading troops.

　　In order to achieve the above goals, US imperialism has decided to allocate funds to "aid" Japan in developing power sources. The US Overseas Technical Assistance Advisory Group stated that private American investment in Japanese power companies is also planned to be realized under the guarantee of the US government. The United States not only attempts to control Japan's production equipment and business institutions but also conspires to completely control the power of Japanese industry.

　　美国指使吉田政府使用盗窃方法
    控制日本企业扩大军需生产
    【新华社九日讯】东京消息：美帝国主义正以各种方式大量利用日本的工厂设备从事军需生产。吉田反动政府最近为了避免国际舆论的指责，以“私人制造商承办”等遮掩的方式，接受美国在日本进行军火生产的订货；并将已被指定作为赔偿的前陆、海军工厂，用“标售”与“暂时使用”等盗窃办法转到美日独占资本的手中。六月二十七日东京广播说：仅在五月份一个月中，外国资本输入日本共四十四起，其中美国占四十起之多。据朝日新闻报道，前陆、海军工厂被“标售”的情形如下：苫小牧制纸公司收购了爱知县前陆军兵工厂鸟居松工厂，神户制钢公司收购了山口县的调布工厂，兴国人绢公司收购了大分县的佐伯工厂，美国散装运输公司与日亚制钢公司被准许“暂时使用”前海军吴港工厂。正在申请中的还有：日本矿业公司与大协石油等公司申请收购前海军四日市燃料厂，神户制钢公司与高砂重工业公司申请收购兵库县的高砂工厂，日丰化学公司申请收购前陆军燃料厂岩国工厂，昭和石油等公司申请收购前海军燃料厂德山工厂，德山铁板公司申请收购山口县前海军工厂“光”工厂。
    另据共同社透露：为加紧军需生产，美国独占资本并在加紧吞并日本独占企业。例如，中日本重工业公司与美国吉普车制造商威利斯·奥佛兰公司进行“合作”。由威利斯·奥佛兰公司在日本设立新公司，以汽车机械零件供给中日本重工业公司装配成完整的车辆。预定每月生产二百辆，并将继续扩充设备，进行增产。所出车辆则由新公司输往东南亚供侵略军队之用。
    美帝国主义为了达到上述目的，已决定调拨资金，“援助”日本开发电源，美国国外技术援助顾问团表示：美国私人对日本电力企业的投资，也计划在美国政府的保证之下使之具体化。美国不但企图控制日本的生产设备和企业机构，并且阴谋完全控制日本工业的动力。
