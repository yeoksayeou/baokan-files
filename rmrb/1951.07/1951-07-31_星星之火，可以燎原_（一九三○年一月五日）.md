A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire
(January 5, 1930)
Mao Zedong
This is a letter from Comrade Mao Zedong, written to criticize a pessimistic ideology within the Party at the time.
　　　　Mao Zedong Selected Works Publishing Committee

Regarding the assessment of the current situation and the accompanying actions we should take, some comrades within our Party still lack a correct understanding. Although they believe that a revolutionary high tide will inevitably arrive, they do not believe that a revolutionary high tide can arrive quickly. Therefore, they do not approve of the plan to seize Jiangxi, but only approve of mobile guerrilla warfare in the three border areas between Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi. At the same time, they do not have a profound concept of establishing red political power in the guerrilla areas, and therefore, they do not have a profound concept of using the consolidation and expansion of this red political power to promote a national revolutionary high tide. They seem to think that doing this arduous work of establishing political power in a period far from the revolutionary high tide is futile, and they hope to expand political influence through a more convenient mobile guerrilla warfare, and then, after the work of winning over the masses has been done in all parts of the country, or to a certain extent, then launch a national armed uprising, and then add the strength of the Red Army to it, and it will become a large-scale national revolution. Their theory of a national scope, including all places, of first winning over the masses and then establishing political power is not suitable for the actual situation of the Chinese revolution. The source of their theory is mainly the failure to recognize that China is a semi-colony where many imperialist countries are vying for each other. If we recognize that China is a semi-colony where many imperialist countries are vying for each other, then, first, we will understand why only China has this strange phenomenon of long-term infighting within the ruling class, and why the infighting is becoming more and more intense, more and more extensive, and why there can never be a unified political power. Second, we will understand the seriousness of the peasant problem, and therefore, we will also understand why the peasant uprisings have developed to such a national scale. Third, we will understand the correctness of the slogan of the worker-peasant democratic political power. Fourth, we will understand another strange phenomenon that has arisen corresponding to the strange phenomenon of long-term infighting within the ruling class that only China has, namely, the existence and development of the Red Army and guerrillas, and the existence and development of small red areas growing in the surrounding white political power that accompany the Red Army and guerrillas (no such strange phenomenon exists outside of China). Fifth, we will also understand that the establishment and development of the Red Army, guerrillas, and red areas is the highest form of the peasant struggle under the leadership of the proletariat in semi-colonial China, and the inevitable result of the development of the peasant struggle in semi-colonial China, and is undoubtedly the most important factor in promoting a national revolutionary high tide. Sixth, we will also understand that a pure mobile guerrilla policy cannot realize the task of promoting a national revolutionary high tide, and that the line of Zhu De and Mao Zedong, Fang Zhimin-style, with a base area, with a planned construction of political power, deeply involved in the land revolution, and expanding the people's armed forces, is through a set of methods such as village militia, district militia brigade, county militia general team, local Red Army, and finally the regular Red Army, and the development of political power is expanding forward in a wave-like manner, and so on, is undoubtedly correct. Only in this way can we establish the belief of the national revolutionary masses, as the Soviet Union did to the whole world. Only in this way can we give the reactionary ruling class great difficulties, shake its foundations, and promote its internal disintegration. Only in this way can we truly create the Red Army and become the main tool of the future great revolution. In short, only in this way can we promote the high tide of the revolution.

Comrades suffering from revolutionary impetuosity inappropriately overestimate the subjective forces of the revolution [2] and underestimate the counter-revolutionary forces. This kind of assessment mostly starts from subjectivism. As a result, it will undoubtedly lead to the path of blind actionism. On the other hand, if we underestimate the subjective forces of the revolution and overestimate the counter-revolutionary forces, this is also an inappropriate assessment, and it will inevitably produce bad results in another aspect. Therefore, when judging the Chinese political situation, it is necessary to recognize the following key points:

(1) Although the subjective forces of the Chinese revolution are weak now, all the organizations (political power, armed forces, parties, etc.) of the reactionary ruling class that are based on China's backward and fragile socio-economic organization are also weak. This can explain why the subjective forces of the revolution in Western European countries are perhaps stronger than the subjective forces of the current Chinese revolution, but because the forces of their reactionary ruling classes are many times stronger than the forces of the Chinese reactionary ruling class, they still cannot immediately erupt into revolution. Although the subjective forces of the current Chinese revolution are weak, because the counter-revolutionary forces are also relatively weak, the trend of the Chinese revolution towards a high tide will definitely be faster than that of Western Europe.

(2) After the failure of the 1927 revolution, the subjective forces of the revolution were indeed greatly weakened. The remaining small force, if only based on certain phenomena, will naturally cause comrades (comrades who hold this view) to have pessimistic thoughts. But if viewed from the essence, it is greatly different. Here, a Chinese saying is useful: "A single spark can start a prairie fire." This means that although there is only a small force now, its development will be very fast. In the Chinese environment, it not only has the possibility of development, but it simply has the inevitability of development, which has been fully proven in the May 30th Movement and the subsequent Great Revolution Movement. We must look at the essence of things, and only regard their phenomena as guides to the door. Once we enter the door, we must grasp their essence. This is a reliable scientific method of analysis.

(3) The assessment of counter-revolutionary forces is also the same. We must never only look at its phenomena, but look at its essence. In the early days of the secession of the Hunan-Jiangxi border area, some comrades, under the incorrect assessment of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee at the time, truly believed the words of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee and regarded the class enemies as worthless. The so-called "extremely shaken" and "panic-stricken," which are still spread as jokes, were the adjectives used by the Hunan Provincial Party Committee to assess Lu Diping [3], the ruler of Hunan, at that time (May to June 1928). Under this assessment, political blind actionism was bound to arise. However, during the period from November of the same year to February of last year (before the Jiang-Gui War [4] broke out), when the enemy's third "encirclement and suppression" [5] came to Jinggangshan, some comrades raised the question of "how long can the red flag be flown?" In fact, at that time, the struggle between Britain, the United States, and Japan in China had reached a very blatant stage, and the situation of the Jiang-Gui-Feng warlord war had already formed. In essence, it was when the counter-revolutionary tide began to fall and the revolutionary tide began to revive. But at that time, not only did the Red Army and the local Party have a pessimistic ideology, but even the Central Committee at that time was inevitably deceived by the superficial situation and developed pessimistic arguments. The Central Committee's letter in February [6] is evidence representing the pessimistic analysis within the Party at that time.

(4) The current objective situation is still easy to confuse comrades who only observe the current superficial phenomena and do not observe the essence. Especially those of us who work in the Red Army, whenever we encounter defeats, or are surrounded on all sides, or are chased by strong enemies, we often unconsciously generalize and expand this temporary, special, small environment, as if the situation in the whole country and the whole world is generally not optimistic, and the prospect of revolutionary victory is very slim. Therefore, there is this kind of observation that grasps the surface and abandons the essence, because they have not scientifically analyzed the essence of the general situation. If we ask whether the high tide of the Chinese revolution is about to arrive, we can only make a decision by examining in detail whether the various contradictions that cause the high tide of the revolution have truly developed forward. Since the contradictions between imperialist countries internationally, between imperialism and colonies, and between imperialism and the proletariat in their own countries have developed, the need for imperialism to compete for China is even more urgent. The more urgent imperialism is to compete for China, the more the contradiction between imperialism and the entire China, and the contradiction between imperialists themselves, will develop in China at the same time, thus creating an increasingly expanding and increasingly fierce infighting between the various factions of reactionary rulers in China. The contradictions between the various factions of reactionary rulers are developing day by day. Accompanying the contradictions between the various factions of reactionary rulers -- the warlord wars -- is the increase in taxes, which will prompt the vast number of taxpayers to develop increasingly intense contradictions with the reactionary rulers. Accompanying the contradiction between imperialism and China's national industry is the fact that China's national industry cannot get concessions from imperialism, which has developed the contradiction between the Chinese bourgeoisie and the Chinese working class. Chinese capitalists try to find a way out by desperately squeezing workers, and Chinese workers resist. Accompanying the commodity aggression of imperialism, the exploitation of China's commercial capital, and the increase in government taxes, the contradiction between the landlord class and the peasants has become more profound, that is, the exploitation of land rent and usury has become heavier, and the peasants hate the landlords even more. Because of the oppression of foreign goods, the exhaustion of the purchasing power of the vast number of workers and peasants, and the increase in government taxes, domestic goods merchants and independent producers are increasingly heading towards bankruptcy. Because the reactionary government has unlimitedly increased the army under the condition of insufficient food and wages, and therefore makes the war more and more frequent, the soldiers are often in a difficult environment. Because of the increase in national taxes, the increase in landlord rent, and the increasing war disasters, widespread famine and banditry have been created throughout the country, making it impossible for the vast number of peasants and urban poor to survive. Because they have no money to go to school, many students in school are worried about losing their schooling; because of backward production, many graduates have no hope of employment. If we recognize the above contradictions, we will know what kind of precarious situation China is in, and what kind of chaotic state it is in. We will know how inevitable the revolutionary high tide against imperialism, warlords, and landlords is, and that it will arrive soon. China is filled with dry firewood, which will soon burn into a raging fire. The words "a single spark can start a prairie fire" are an appropriate description of the development of the current situation. Just look at the development of workers' strikes, peasant riots, soldier mutinies, and student strikes in many places, and we will know that this "single spark" is undoubtedly not far from the period of "prairie fire."

The gist of the above words was already in the letter from the former committee to the Central Committee on April 5 last year. That letter said:

"The Central Committee's letter (February 9 last year) is too pessimistic in its assessment of the objective situation and subjective forces. The Kuomintang's three "encirclements and suppressions" of Jinggangshan represent the highest tide of counter-revolution. But up to this point, the counter-revolutionary tide will gradually fall, and the revolutionary tide will gradually rise. Although the Party's combat effectiveness and organizational power are as weak as the Central Committee said, under the situation that the counter-revolutionary tide is gradually falling, recovery will be very fast, and the negative attitude of the Party's cadres will also be quickly eliminated. The masses will definitely turn to us. Slaughterism [7] is of course driving fish into deep water, and reformism can no longer appeal to the masses. The masses' illusions about the Kuomintang will definitely be quickly eliminated. Under the future situation, no party can compete with the Communist Party for the masses. The political and organizational lines indicated by the Sixth National Congress of the Party [8] are correct: the current stage of the revolution is democracy rather than socialism, and the Party's (note: the five words "in big cities" should be added) current task is to win over the masses rather than immediately launch riots. But the development of the revolution will be very fast, and the propaganda and preparation for armed riots should take a positive attitude. Under the current situation of great chaos, only positive slogans and positive attitudes can lead the masses. The recovery of the Party's combat effectiveness is also possible only under this positive attitude. ... Proletarian leadership is the only key to revolutionary victory. The establishment of the Party's proletarian foundation, the creation of industrial branches in the central area, is an important task for the Party in terms of organization at present; but at the same time, the development of rural struggles, the establishment of small-area red political power, and the creation and expansion of the Red Army are especially the main conditions for helping urban struggles and promoting the high tide of the revolution. Therefore, abandoning urban struggles is wrong; but fearing the development of peasant forces, thinking that they will surpass the forces of the workers and be detrimental to the revolution, if there are such opinions among the Party members, we think it is also wrong. Because in semi-colonial China, the revolution will only fail if the peasant struggle does not receive the leadership of the workers, and the development of the peasant struggle will not surpass the forces of the workers and be detrimental to the revolution itself." This letter gave the following answer to the question of the Red Army's action strategy:

"The Central Committee wants us to divide the troops very small, scatter them into the countryside, and Zhu and Mao leave the troops, hide large targets, the purpose is to preserve the Red Army and mobilize the masses. This is an unrealistic idea. Taking companies or battalions as units, acting alone, scattered in the countryside, using guerrilla tactics to mobilize the masses, and avoiding targets, we planned it in the winter of 1927, and implemented it many times, but all failed. Because: (1) Most of the main Red Army is not local, and its origins are different from the local militia. (2) If the division is small, the leadership is unsound, and it cannot cope with the bad environment, and it is easy to fail. (3) It is easy to be defeated by the enemy one by one. (4) The more severe the environment, the more the troops must be concentrated, and the leaders must struggle resolutely to unite internally and cope with the enemy. Only in a good environment is it good to divide the troops for guerrilla warfare, and the leaders are not as inseparable as in a bad environment."

The shortcoming of this passage is: the reasons given for not being able to divide the troops are all negative, which is very insufficient. The positive reason for concentrating forces is: only by concentrating can we eliminate larger enemies, and only by occupying towns can we eliminate larger enemies and occupy towns can we mobilize a wider range of masses and establish political power in several counties linked together. Only in this way can we stir up attention from far and near (the so-called expanding political influence) and have a practical effect on promoting the revolutionary high tide. For example, the Hunan-Jiangxi border area political power that we did the year before last, and the western Fujian political power [9] that we did last year, were the results of this policy of concentrating forces. This is the general principle. As for whether there are times when we divide the troops? There are also. The letter from the former committee to the Central Committee said about the Red Army's guerrilla tactics, which included short-range troop divisions:

"The tactics we have learned from the struggle in the past three years are really different from the tactics of ancient and modern China and foreign countries. Using our tactics, the mobilization of the masses' struggle is becoming wider and wider every day, and no powerful enemy can do anything to us. Our tactics are guerrilla tactics. Generally speaking, they are: "Divide the troops to mobilize the masses, concentrate to deal with the enemy." "The enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy camps, we harass; the enemy tires, we strike; the enemy retreats, we pursue." "Seizing fixed areas [10], using a wave-like advance policy. Strong enemies follow and chase, using a spiral-like circling policy." "In a very short time, with good methods, mobilize a large number of masses." This tactic is like casting a net, which must be opened and closed at any time. Open to win over the masses, close to deal with the enemy. For three years, we have been using this tactic."

The so-called "opening" here refers to short-range troop divisions. For example, when Yongxin was taken for the first time on the Hunan-Jiangxi border, the 29th Regiment and the 31st Regiment divided their troops within Yongxin. For example, when Yongxin was taken for the third time, the 28th Regiment went to the Anfu border, the 29th Regiment went to Lianhua, and the 31st Regiment went to the Ji'an border. For example, the troop divisions in various counties in southern Jiangxi from April to May last year, and the troop divisions in various counties in western Fujian in July. As for long-range troop divisions, they are only possible under the two conditions of a better environment and a more sound leadership organ. Because the purpose of dividing the troops is to better win over the masses, better engage in the land revolution and establish political power, and better expand the Red Army and local armed forces. If these goals cannot be achieved, or if the division of troops suffers failure and weakens the strength of the Red Army, such as the troop division to attack Chenzhou on the Hunan-Jiangxi border in August the year before last, it is better not to divide the troops. If the above two conditions are met, then it should undoubtedly divide the troops, because under these two conditions, dispersal is more beneficial than concentration.

The spirit of the Central Committee's letter in February was not good, and this letter had a bad influence on some comrades in the Fourth Army Party. The Central Committee also had a circular at that time, saying that the Jiang-Gui War would not necessarily break out. But since then, the Central Committee's assessment and instructions have been generally correct. The Central Committee has issued a circular to correct that inappropriate assessment. Although the letter to the Red Army has not been corrected, the subsequent instructions have not had those pessimistic arguments, and the proposals for the Red Army's actions are also consistent with our proposals. But the bad influence that the Central Committee's letter had on some comrades still exists. Therefore, I feel that it is still necessary to explain this issue at the present time.

The plan to seize Jiangxi in one year was also proposed to the Central Committee by the former committee in April last year, and then a decision was made in Yudu. The reasons pointed out at that time were seen in the letter to the Central Committee, as follows:

"The Jiang-Gui troops are approaching each other in the Jiujiang area, and a major war is about to break out. The recovery of the masses' struggle, coupled with the expansion of internal contradictions in the reactionary rule, makes the revolutionary high tide likely to arrive soon. In this situation, we feel that in the southern provinces, the comprador landlords' military forces in Guangdong and Hunan provinces are too large, and Hunan has almost lost all Party members and masses inside and outside the Party due to the mistakes of the Party's blind actionism. The three provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang have formed another situation. First, the enemy's military forces in the three provinces are the weakest. Zhejiang only has a small number of provincial defense forces of Jiang Bocheng [11]. Although Fujian has 14 regiments in five units, Guo's brigade [12] has been defeated; Chen and Lu's [13] two units are all bandit troops with very low combat effectiveness; the two marine brigades on the coast have never fought before and their combat effectiveness must not be great; only Zhang Zhen [14] is relatively capable of fighting, but according to the analysis of the Fujian Provincial Party Committee, Zhang also only has two regiments with stronger combat effectiveness. Moreover, Fujian is now in a completely chaotic and unified state. Jiangxi's Zhu Peide [15] and Xiong Shihui's [16] two units have a total of 16 regiments, which are stronger than the military forces in Fujian and Zhejiang, but much worse than Hunan. Second, the mistakes of blind actionism in the three provinces are relatively few. Except that we don't know much about the situation in Zhejiang, the foundations of the Party and the masses in Jiangxi and Fujian are better than those in Hunan. Taking Jiangxi as an example, De'an, Xiushui, and Tonggu in northern Jiangxi still have a considerable foundation. The forces of the Party and the militia in Ninggang, Yongxin, Lianhua, and Suichuan in western Jiangxi still exist; the hope in southern Jiangxi is even greater, and the Red Army's Second and Fourth Regiments in counties such as Ji'an, Yongxin, and Xingguo are developing; Fang Zhimin's Red Army has not been eliminated. This has created a situation of encircling Nanchang. We suggest to the Central Committee that during the long-term war between Kuomintang warlords, we should compete with the Jiang and Gui factions for Jiangxi, while also taking into account western Fujian and western Zhejiang. Expand the number of the Red Army in the three provinces and create the masses' secession, with one year as the time limit to complete this plan."

What is wrong with the above words about striving for Jiangxi is the stipulation of one year as the time limit. As for striving for Jiangxi, in addition to Jiangxi's own conditions, it also contains the conditions for the national revolutionary high tide to arrive soon. Because if we do not believe that the revolutionary high tide will arrive soon, we will never reach the conclusion of striving for Jiangxi in one year. The shortcoming of that suggestion is that it should not be stipulated as one year, and therefore, the so-called "soon" of the revolutionary high tide that is about to arrive inevitably has some impatience attached to it. As for the subjective and objective conditions in Jiangxi, they are very worthy of attention. In addition to the subjective conditions as mentioned in the letter to the Central Committee, there are now three objective conditions that can be clearly pointed out: First, Jiangxi's economy is mainly a feudal economy, the power of the commercial bourgeoisie is relatively small, and the landlords' armed forces are weaker than those in any other southern province. Second, Jiangxi does not have its own provincial army, and foreign provincial armies have always been stationed here. Foreign armies "suppress communists" and "suppress bandits," are not familiar with the situation, and are far from being as concerned as the local provincial army, and they are often not very enthusiastic. Third, it is farther away from the influence of imperialism, not as close to Hong Kong as Guangdong, and almost everything is dominated by Britain. If we understand these three points, we can explain why the peasant uprisings in Jiangxi are more common than those in any other province, and the Red Army guerrillas are more numerous than those in any other province.

What is the explanation for the word "soon" in the so-called revolutionary high tide that is about to arrive? This point is a common question for many comrades. Marxists are not fortune tellers. The future development and changes should and can only say a general direction, and it should not and cannot mechanically stipulate the date. But what I said about the high tide of the Chinese revolution coming soon is by no means an empty thing that has no meaning of action, such as what some people call "there is a possibility of arrival," which is something that can be hoped for but not reached. It is standing on the coast and looking at a ship in the sea with the tip of the mast already visible, it is standing on the top of a high mountain and looking at the east and seeing a round of morning sun with brilliant rays about to burst out, it is a baby about to mature and restless in the mother's womb.

Appendix:
[1] Comrade Fang Zhimin, a native of Yiyang, Jiangxi, a member of the Sixth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, was the creator of the red area in northeastern Jiangxi and the Tenth Army of the Red Army. In 1934, he led the Red Army's Anti-Japanese Vanguard Northward. In January 1935, he was arrested while fighting against the Kuomintang counter-revolutionary army. In July of the same year, he died heroically in Nanchang.
[2] The "subjective forces of the revolution" mentioned here by Comrade Mao Zedong refer to the organized revolutionary forces.
[3] Lu Diping, a Kuomintang warlord, served as the chairman of the Kuomintang Hunan Province in 1928, and the chairman of the Kuomintang Jiangxi Province from 1930 to 1931.
[4] The Jiang-Gui War refers to the war between Chiang Kai-shek, the Kuomintang Nanjing warlord, and Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi, the Guangxi warlords, in March and April 1929.
[5] Refers to the third invasion of the Jinggangshan Red Army base area by the Kuomintang warlords of Hunan and Jiangxi in 1929.
[6] The "Central Committee's letter in February" refers to the letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Front Committee on February 9, 1929. The letter from the Former Enemy Committee to the Central Committee on April 5, 1929, quoted in this article, briefly excerpted the contents of the letter, mainly regarding the assessment of the situation at that time and the Red Army's action strategy. The opinions put forward in this letter from the Central Committee were inappropriate, so the Former Enemy Committee put forward different opinions in the letter to the Central Committee.
[7] Refers to the means by which the counter-revolutionary forces use bloody massacres to deal with the revolutionary forces of the people.
[8] The "Sixth National Congress of the Party" refers to the Sixth National Congress of the Communist Party of China in July 1928. This congress pointed out that after the failure of the revolution in 1927, the nature of the Chinese revolution was still an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal bourgeois democratic revolution, and pointed out that a new revolutionary high tide was inevitable, but this new revolutionary high tide had not yet arrived, so the general line of the revolution at that time was to win over the masses. The Sixth National Congress liquidated Chen Duxiu's right-wing capitulationism in 1927, and also criticized the "left" blind actionism that occurred within the Party in late 1927 and early 1928 after the failure of the revolution in 1927.

　　星星之火，可以燎原
　  （一九三○年一月五日）
　　毛泽东
    这是毛泽东同志的一篇通信，是为批判当时党内的一种悲观思想而写的。
          毛泽东选集出版委员会
    在对于时局的估量和伴随而来的我们的行动问题上，我们党内有一部分同志还缺少正确的认识。他们虽然相信革命高潮不可避免地要到来，却不相信革命高潮有迅速到来的可能。因此他们不赞成争取江西的计划，而只赞成在福建、广东、江西之间的三个边界区域的流动游击，同时也没有在游击区域建立红色政权的深刻的观念，因此也就没有用这种红色政权的巩固和扩大去促进全国革命高潮的深刻的观念。他们似乎认为在距离革命高潮尚远的时期做这种建立政权的艰苦工作为徒劳，而希望用比较轻便的流动游击方式去扩大政治影响，等到全国各地争取群众的工作做好了，或做到某个地步了，然后再来一个全国武装起义，那时把红军的力量加上去，就成为全国范围的大革命。他们这种全国范围的、包括一切地方的、先争取群众、后建立政权的理论，是于中国革命的实情不适合的。他们的这种理论的来源，主要是没有把中国是一个许多帝国主义国家互相争夺的半殖民地这件事认清楚。如果认清了中国是一个许多帝国主义国家互相争夺的半殖民地，则一，就会明白全世界何以只有中国有这种统治阶级内部互相长期混战的怪事，而且何以混战一天激烈一天，一天扩大一天，何以始终不能有一个统一的政权。二，就会明白农民问题的严重性，因之，也就会明白农村起义何以有现在这样的全国规模的发展。三，就会明白工农民主政权这个口号的正确。四，就会明白相应于全世界只有中国有统治阶级内部长期混战的一件怪事而产生出来的另一件怪事，即红军和游击队的存在和发展，以及伴随着红军和游击队而来的，成长于四围白色政权中的小块红色区域的存在和发展（中国以外无此怪事）。五，也就会明白红军、游击队和红色区域的建立和发展，是半殖民地中国在无产阶级领导之下的农民斗争的最高形式，和半殖民地农民斗争发展的必然结果，并且无疑义地是促进全国革命高潮的最重要因素。六，也就会明白单纯的流动游击政策，不能实现促进全国革命高潮的任务，而朱德毛泽东式、方志敏〔一〕式之有根据地的，有计划地建设政权的，深入土地革命的，扩大人民武装的路线是经由乡赤卫队、区赤卫大队、县赤卫总队、地方红军直至正规红军这样一套办法的，政权发展是波浪式地向前扩大的，等等的政策，无疑义地是正确的。必须这样，才能树立全国革命群众的信仰，如苏联之于全世界然。必须这样，才能给反动统治阶级以甚大的困难，动摇其基础而促进其内部的分解。也必须这样，才能真正地创造红军，成为将来大革命的主要工具。总而言之，必须这样，才能促进革命的高潮。
    犯着革命急性病的同志们不切当地看大了革命的主观力量〔二〕，而看小了反革命力量。这种估量，多半是从主观主义出发。其结果，无疑地是要走上盲动主义的道路。另一方面，如果把革命的主观力量看小了，把反革命力量看大了，这也是一种不切当的估量，又必然要产生另一方面的坏结果。因此，在判断中国政治形势的时候，需要认识下面的这些要点：
    （一）现在中国革命的主观力量虽然弱，但是立足于中国落后的脆弱的社会经济组织之上的反动统治阶级的一切组织（政权、武装、党派等）也是弱的。这样就可以解释现在西欧各国革命的主观力量虽然比现在中国革命的主观力量也许要强些，但因为它们的反动统治阶级的力量比中国的反动统治阶级的力量更要强大得许多倍，所以它们仍然不能即时爆发革命。现时中国革命的主观力量虽然弱，但是因为反革命力量也是相对地弱的，所以中国革命的走向高潮，一定会比西欧快。
    （二）一九二七年革命失败以后，革命的主观力量确实大为削弱了。剩下的一点小小的力量，若仅依据某些现象来看，自然要使同志们（作这样看法的同志们）发生悲观的念头。但若从实质上看，便大大不然。这里用得着中国的一句老话：“星星之火，可以燎原。”这就是说，现在虽只有一点小小的力量，但是它的发展会是很快的。它在中国的环境里不仅是具备了发展的可能性，简直是具备了发展的必然性，这在五卅运动及其以后的大革命运动已经得了充分的证明。我们看事情必须要看它的实质，而把它的现象只看作入门的向导，一进了门就要抓住它的实质，这才是可靠的科学的分析方法。
    （三）对反革命力量的估量也是这样，决不可只看它的现象，要去看它的实质。当湘赣边界割据的初期，有些同志在当时湖南省委的不正确的估量之下，真正相信湖南省委的话，把阶级敌人看得一钱不值；到现在还传为笑谈的所谓“十分动摇”、“恐慌万状”两句话，就是那时（一九二八年五月至六月）湖南省委估量湖南的统治者鲁涤平〔三〕的形容词。在这种估量之下，就必然要产生政治上的盲动主义。但是到了同年十一月至去年二月（蒋桂战争〔四〕尚未爆发之前）约四个月期间内，敌人的第三次“会剿”〔五〕临到了井冈山的时候，一部分同志又有“红旗到底打得多久”的疑问提出来了。其实，那时英、美、日在中国的斗争已到十分露骨的地步，蒋桂冯混战的形势业已形成，实质上是反革命潮流开始下落，革命潮流开始复兴的时候。但是在那个时候，不但红军和地方党内有一种悲观的思想，就是中央那时也不免为那种表面上的情况所迷惑，而发生了悲观的论调。中央二月来信〔六〕就是代表那时候党内悲观分析的证据。
    （四）现时的客观情况，还是容易给只观察当前表面现象不观察实质的同志们以迷惑。特别是我们在红军中工作的人，一遇到败仗，或四面被围，或强敌跟追的时候，往往不自觉地把这种一时的特殊的小的环境，一般化扩大化起来，仿佛全国全世界的形势概属未可乐观，革命胜利的前途未免渺茫得很。所以有这种抓住表面抛弃实质的观察，是因为他们对于一般情况的实质并没有科学地加以分析。如问中国革命高潮是否快要到来，只有详细地去察看引起革命高潮的各种矛盾是否真正向前发展了，才能作决定。既然国际上帝国主义相互之间、帝国主义和殖民地之间、帝国主义和它们本国的无产阶级之间的矛盾是发展了，帝国主义争夺中国的需要就更迫切了。帝国主义争夺中国一迫切，帝国主义和整个中国的矛盾，帝国主义者相互间的矛盾，就同时在中国境内发展起来，因此就造成中国各派反动统治者之间的一天天扩大、一天天激烈的混战，中国各派反动统治者之间的矛盾，就日益发展起来。伴随各派反动统治者之间的矛盾——军阀混战而来的，是赋税的加重，这样就会促令广大的负担赋税者和反动统治者之间的矛盾日益发展。伴随着帝国主义和中国民族工业的矛盾而来的，是中国民族工业得不到帝国主义的让步的事实，这就发展了中国资产阶级和中国工人阶级之间的矛盾，中国资本家从拚命压榨工人找出路，中国工人则给以抵抗。伴随着帝国主义的商品侵略，中国商业资本的剥蚀，和政府的赋税加重等项情况，便使地主阶级和农民的矛盾更加深刻化，即地租和高利贷的剥削更加重了，农民则更加仇恨地主。因为外货的压迫，广大工农群众购买力的枯竭和政府赋税的加重，使得国货商人和独立生产者日益走上破产的道路。因为反动政府在粮饷不足的条件之下无限制地增加军队，并因此而使战争一天多于一天，使得士兵群众经常处在困苦的环境之中。因为国家的赋税加重，地主的租息加重和战祸的日广一日，造成了普遍于全国的灾荒和匪祸，使得广大的农民和城市贫民走上求生不得的道路。因为无钱开学，许多在学学生有失学之忧；因为生产落后，许多毕业学生无就业之望。如果我们认识了以上这些矛盾，就知道中国是处在怎样一种皇皇不可终日的局面之下，处在怎样一种混乱状态之下。就知道反帝反军阀反地主的革命高潮，是怎样不可避免，而且是很快会要到来。中国是全国都布满了干柴，很快就会燃成烈火。“星火燎原”的话，正是时局发展的适当的描写。只要看一看许多地方工人罢工、农民暴动、士兵哗变、学生罢课的发展，就知道这个“星星之火”，距“燎原”的时期，毫无疑义地是不远了。
    上面的话的大意，在去年四月五日前委给中央的信中，就已经有了。那封信上说：
    “中央此信（去年二月九日）对客观形势和主观力量的估量，都太悲观了。国民党三次进“剿”井冈山，表示了反革命的最高潮。然至此为止，往后便是反革命潮流逐渐低落，革命潮流逐渐升涨。党的战斗力组织力虽然弱到如中央所云，但在反革命潮流逐渐低落的形势之下，恢复一定很快，党内干部分子的消极态度也会迅速消灭。群众是一定归向我们的。屠杀主义〔七〕固然是为渊驱鱼，改良主义也再不能号召群众了。群众对国民党的幻想一定很快地消灭。在将来的形势之下，什么党派都是不能和共产党争群众的。党的六次大会〔八〕所指示的政治路线和组织路线是对的：革命的现时阶段是民权主义而不是社会主义，党（按：应加“在大城市中”五个字）的目前任务是争取群众而不是马上举行暴动。但是革命的发展将是很快的，武装暴动的宣传和准备应该采取积极的态度。在大混乱的现局之下，只有积极的口号积极的态度才能领导群众。党的战斗力的恢复也一定要在这种积极态度之下才有可能。……无产阶级领导是革命胜利的唯一关键。党的无产阶级基础的建立，中心区域产业支部的创造，是目前党在组织方面的重要任务；但是在同时，农村斗争的发展，小区域红色政权的建立，红军的创造和扩大，尤其是帮助城市斗争，促进革命潮流高涨的主要条件。所以，抛弃城市斗争，是错误的；但是畏惧农民势力的发展，以为将超过工人的势力而不利于革命，如果党员中有这种意见，我们以为也是错误的。因为半殖民地中国的革命，只有农民斗争得不到工人的领导而失败，没有农民斗争的发展超过工人的势力而不利于革命本身的。”这封信对红军的行动策略问题有如下的答复：
    “中央要我们将队伍分得很小，散向农村中，朱、毛离开队伍，隐匿大的目标，目的在于保存红军和发动群众。这是一种不切实际的想法。以连或营为单位，单独行动，分散在农村中，用游击的战术发动群众，避免目标，我们从一九二七年冬天就计划过，而且多次实行过，但是都失败了。因为：（一）主力红军多不是本地人，和地方赤卫队来历不同。（二）分小则领导不健全，恶劣环境应付不来，容易失败。（三）容易被敌人各个击破。（四）愈是恶劣环境，队伍愈须集中，领导者愈须坚决奋斗，方能团结内部，应付敌人。只有在好的环境里才好分兵游击，领导者也不如在恶劣环境时的刻不能离。”
    这一段话的缺点是：所举不能分兵的理由，都是消极的，这是很不够的。兵力集中的积极的理由是：集中了才能消灭大一点的敌人，才能占领城镇。消灭了大一点的敌人，占领了城镇，才能发动大范围的群众，建立几个县联在一块的政权。这样才能耸动远近的视听（所谓扩大政治影响），才能于促进革命高潮发生实际的效力。例如我们前年干的湘赣边界政权，去年干的闽西政权〔九〕，都是这种兵力集中政策的结果。这是一般的原则。至于说到也有分兵的时候没有呢？也是有的。前委给中央的信上说了红军的游击战术，那里面包括了近距离的分兵：
    “我们三年来从斗争中所得的战术，真是和古今中外的战术都不同。用我们的战术，群众斗争的发动是一天比一天广大的，任何强大的敌人是奈何我们不得的。我们的战术就是游击的战术。大要说来是：“分兵以发动群众，集中以应付敌人。”“敌进我退，敌驻我扰，敌疲我打，敌退我追。”“固定区域的割据〔一○〕，用波浪式的推进政策。强敌跟追，用盘旋式的打圈子政策。”“很短的时间，很好的方法，发动很大的群众。”这种战术正如打网，要随时打开，又要随时收拢。打开以争取群众，收拢以应付敌人。三年以来，都是用的这种战术。”
    这里所谓“打开”，就是指近距离的分兵。例如湘赣边界第一次打下永新时，二十九团和三十一团在永新境内的分兵。又如第三次打下永新时，二十八团往安福边境，二十九团往莲花，三十一团往吉安边界的分兵。又如去年四月至五月在赣南各县的分兵，七月在闽西各县的分兵。至于远距离的分兵，则要在好一点的环境和在比较健全的领导机关两个条件之下才有可能。因为分兵的目的，是为了更能争取群众，更能深入土地革命和建立政权，更能扩大红军和地方武装。若不能达到这些目的，或者反因分兵而遭受失败，削弱了红军的力量，例如前年八月湘赣边界分兵打郴州那样，则不如不分为好。如果具备了上述两个条件，那就无疑地应该分兵，因为在这两个条件下，分散比集中更有利。
    中央二月来信的精神是不好的，这封信给了四军党内一部分同志以不良影响。中央那时还有一个通告，谓蒋桂战争不一定会爆发。但从此以后，中央的估量和指示，大体上说来就都是对的了。对于那个估量不适当的通告，中央已发了一个通告去更正。对于红军的这一封信，虽然没有更正，但是后来的指示，就没有那些悲观的论调了，对于红军行动的主张也和我们的主张一致了。但是中央那个信给一部分同志的不良影响是仍然存在的。因此，我觉得就在现时仍有对此问题加以解释的必要。
    关于一年争取江西的计划，也是去年四月前委向中央提出的，后来又在雩都有一次决定。当时指出的理由，见之于给中央信上的，如下：
    “蒋桂部队在九江一带彼此逼近，大战爆发即在眼前。群众斗争的恢复，加上反动统治内部矛盾的扩大，使革命高潮可能快要到来。在这种局面之下来布置工作，我们觉得南方数省中广东湖南两省买办地主的军力太大，湖南则更因党的盲动主义的错误，党内党外群众几乎尽失。闽赣浙三省则另成一种形势。第一，三省敌人军力最弱。浙江只有蒋伯诚〔一一〕的少数省防军。福建五部虽有十四团，但郭旅〔一二〕已被击破；陈卢〔一三〕两部均土匪军，战斗力甚低；陆战队两旅在沿海从前并未打过仗，战斗力必不大；只有张贞〔一四〕比较能打，但据福建省委分析，张亦只有两个团战力较强。且福建现在完全是混乱状态，不统一。江西朱培德〔一五〕、熊式辉〔一六〕两部共有十六团，比闽浙军力为强，然比起湖南来就差得多。第二，三省的盲动主义错误比较少。除浙江情况我们不大明了外，江西福建两省党和群众的基础，都比湖南好些。以江西论，赣北之德安、修水、铜鼓尚有相当基础。赣西宁冈、永新、莲花、遂川，党和赤卫队的势力是依然存在的；赣南的希望更大，吉安、永新、兴国等县的红军第二第四团有日益发展之势；方志敏的红军并未消灭。这样就造成了向南昌包围的形势。我们建议中央，在国民党军阀长期战争期间，我们要和蒋桂两派争取江西，同时兼及闽西、浙西。在三省扩大红军的数量，造成群众的割据，以一年为期完成此计划。”
    上面争取江西的话，不对的是规定一年为期。至于争取江西，除开江西的本身条件之外，还包含有全国革命高潮快要到来的条件。因为如果不相信革命高潮快要到来，便决不能得到一年争取江西的结论。那个建议的缺点就是不该规定为一年，因此，影响到革命高潮快要到来的所谓“快要”，也不免伴上了一些急躁性。至于江西的主观客观条件是很值得注意的。除主观条件如给中央信上所说外，客观条件现在可以明白指出的有三点：一是江西的经济主要是封建的经济，商业资产阶级势力较少，而地主的武装在南方各省中又比那一省都弱。二是江西没有本省的军队，向来都是外省军队来此驻防。外来军队“剿共”“剿匪”，情形不熟，又远非本省军队那样关系切身，往往不很热心。三是距离帝国主义的影响比较远一点，不比广东接近香港，差不多甚么都受英国的支配。我们懂得了这三点，就可以解释为什么江西的农村起义比那一省都要普遍，红军游击队比那一省都要多了。
    所谓革命高潮快要到来的“快要”二字作何解释，这点是许多同志的共同的问题。马克思主义者不是算命先生，未来的发展和变化，只应该也只能说出个大的方向，不应该也不可能机械地规定时日。但我所说的中国革命高潮快要到来，决不是如有些人所谓“有到来之可能”那样完全没有行动意义的、可望而不可即的一种空的东西。它是站在海岸遥望海中已经看得见桅杆尖头了的一只航船，它是立于高山之巅远看东方已见光芒四射喷薄欲出的一轮朝日，它是躁动于母腹中的快要成熟了的一个婴儿。
