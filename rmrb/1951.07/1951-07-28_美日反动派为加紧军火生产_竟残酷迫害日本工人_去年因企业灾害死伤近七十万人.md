　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 26th: In order to utilize Japanese factories to step up arms production, American imperialism is cruelly oppressing Japanese workers. At the same time, due to extremely harsh working conditions and excessive labor intensity, a large number of casualties are constantly occurring. According to a July 2nd Asahi Shimbun report, "692,000 workers across Japan were killed or injured in industrial accidents in 1950, an increase of 5% compared to 1949." In particular, factories producing military supplies for the US military have the highest number of casualties.
    For example, Asano Shipbuilding Company in Japan, in order to step up the production of military supplies for the American aggressor army after the outbreak of the Korean War, forced workers to work overtime. From the end of June to mid-August last year, all workers averaged 170 hours of overtime per person in just one month (an average of more than five hours of overtime per day). Some workers even worked 300 hours of overtime in one month (an average of ten hours per day). The company authorities, fearing worker resistance, used despicable means such as persecuting union cadres and supervising the workshops all day long to suppress the workers. The US military's direct oppression of the workshops is even more brutal. For example, at Ikegai Automobile Manufacturing Plant, workers are not only denied smoking time, but even lunch time. Among the 1,310 workers in the factory, the number of injured has increased from 120 to 130 per month in the past to 300, with an average of one in four workers injured at work. Another example is Kawasaki Steel Works, which has reduced the workers' original 30-minute bathing time to only 10 minutes. Due to this excessive labor, the number of workers suffering from lung disease among the 10,393 workers in the institute has increased to 3,000, accounting for nearly one-third of the total number of workers. This brutal crime of the US-Japanese reactionaries endangering the lives of Japanese workers has aroused the anger and resistance of the Japanese working class.

　　美日反动派为加紧军火生产
　  竟残酷迫害日本工人
　  去年因企业灾害死伤近七十万人
    【新华社二十六日讯】东京消息：美帝国主义为利用日本工厂加紧军火生产，正残酷地压迫日本工人。同时，由于劳动条件的极端恶劣和劳动强度的过分增加，因而不断发生大量伤亡事件。据七月二日朝日新闻消息，日本全国在一九五○年由于“企业灾害而死伤的工人达六十九万二千人。比一九四九年增加了百分之五。”特别是为美军生产军需物资的工厂，其伤亡事件为最多。
    例如日本的浅野船渠公司，在朝鲜战争爆发后，为了加紧为美国侵略军生产军需物资，强迫工人加班工作。自去年六月末到八月中旬，全部工人仅在一个月内每人平均加班时间就有一百七十小时（平均每天加班五小时以上）。甚至有某一工人一个月内加班三百小时（平均每天十小时）。公司资方当局害怕工人反抗，用迫害工会干部和整天在车间监工的卑劣手段，来压制工人。美军直接对车间的压迫更为残暴。例如池贝汽车制造厂，不仅不许工人有吸烟的时间，甚至不许工人有吃午饭的时间。在该厂一千三百一十名工人中，负伤人数从过去每月一百二十人到一百三十人增加到三百人，平均每四人中就有一人在工作中负伤。又如川崎制铁所，把工人原有的三十分钟的洗澡时间也剥夺到只剩十分钟了。由于这种过分的劳动，该所一万零三百九十三名工人中患肺病者增加至三千名，占工人总数将近三分之一。美日反动派这种危害日本工人生命的残暴罪行，已引起日本工人阶级的忿怒和反抗。
