The school was allotted four places, but 31 students have already signed up. After Hebei High School announced the allocated enrollment quotas for this military cadre school on June 28th, many students were worried that they would not be approved due to the limited number of places. Many Youth League members went to talk to the person in charge of the school's Youth League general branch or wrote letters to the general branch, expressing their determination to join the military cadre school. More than one-third of the third-year junior high school students of Beijing Municipal No. 2 Middle School have requested to sign up since hearing the news of the military cadre school's enrollment. Students from Municipal No. 1, No. 3, No. 4, No. 6, No. 7, No. 8 Middle Schools, and No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4 Girls' Middle Schools, and Guanghua Girls' Middle School have all requested to sign up.

Many Youth League members at Beijing Agricultural University expressed their determination to the Youth League Committee to join the military cadre school. Thirty-three students from Yenching University have already signed up. Fan Yueqing, a student at Municipal No. 2 Girls' Middle School, said, "I am a glorious Youth League member. I once raised my right hand and swore before Chairman Mao to fight to the end for the construction of a New Democratic China and for the complete liberation of all mankind. Today is the time for me to fulfill my promise." Zhou Shiying, a student at No. 4 Girls' Middle School, said, "When I think of the Soviet Paul and Danya dedicating their lives to their great motherland, I feel that I should do the same." Beijing Municipal No. 6 Middle School invited students who had previously participated in military cadre schools, and No. 7 Middle School invited six comrades from a special forces unit of the People's Liberation Army to hold a forum at the school. Guanghua Girls' Middle School also invited a representative from a military cadre school to the school to introduce the situation of the military cadre school. Many students who signed up unanimously expressed their unconditional obedience to the organization's arrangements. They said they would go wherever the motherland needed them, and they would never "make trouble" if they were not approved. Many school teachers and parents of students have encouraged students and children to sign up for military cadre schools.
