Oppose the "Rocket" That Propagates for Imperialism
Zhang Yidi, Opening Up Bookstore, Second Edition, March 1951
Jin Xinchu

The "Opening Up Youth Series" published by the Opening Up Bookstore contains many books that are helpful for young readers to learn natural sciences and social sciences. However, "Rocket," one of the books in this series, is a book with very absurd content.

The book consists of twelve chapters, outlining the history of rockets, flight principles, construction, fuel, remote control, as well as the current situation and future development of rocket research and use. The author has realized: "Most of the current rockets are designed for military purposes. Its function is only to投送destructive substances to the target area, so what significance rockets have for most people has become a question." "But we firmly believe that in the near future, rocket research will turn to paths that benefit all mankind." (Page 71) If the author could start from this understanding and appropriately grasp and process the materials in the book, then this popular science work would at least not be very harmful. However, the author could not control his materials in the writing process—mainly the materials of US imperialism—and became a prisoner of those materials; this made the book violate the attempt of scientific research, turned it into a war-mongering, propaganda of imperialism's arrogant weapon-only theory of conquering the world, and turned it into an extremely harmful reading material that threatens the world's peace-loving people.

The first mistake of this book is that it praises the "achievements" of fascist Germany and US imperialists in manufacturing killing weapons everywhere. The author says: "Germany has done a wide range of research... Many missiles have been completed... The most famous of course is the V-2." (Page 12) "The Germans have such good results because they concentrated all their efforts on research." (Page 13) "The Germans have made the greatest contribution to rocket research." (Page 58) "After this war, the United States transported this type of rocket (note: referring to the V-2) to research it, and also imitated several of them, from which the success of the design can be seen." (Page 62) "The Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology in the United States has conducted more in-depth research." (Page 48) "A new type of rocket recently made in the United States is expected to perform better than the V-2." (Page 68) In short, it gives people an absurd impression: the reactionary, backward, and dark American-German fascist countries are the most developed countries in rocket "science"! Not to mention that the achievements of Soviet science (mainly not used for war) research have surpassed the United States, even if only in terms of imperialist countries, the fascist Germany's research on rockets was "meritorious" for war, for killing human beings (the author said it was for "revenge"), what is the purpose of the US imperialists doing this? Naturally, it is also for war. Such "scientific research" should be severely criticized, but the author praises this fascist aggressive "science" as "national defense scientific work"! A German who served fascism died in a rocket laboratory explosion, but the author said that he "martyred," regretting that he "martyred" for the "difficulties" of the imperialist aggressive policy! (Pages 10-11)

The second mistake of this book is that it is frightened by the weapon-only theory of imperialism. He wrote: "According to the opinion of general strategists, the most terrible weapon in the next war is the atomic bomb rocket," and "there is almost no possibility of defense." Isn't this the old tune of imperialism's atomic exaggeration mania? The author almost completely failed to consider that modern science has proved that the latest weapons such as any atomic and rocket cannot determine the victory or defeat of the war, and that any kind of weapon can be countered with the same weapon.

The author even peddles such absurd war propaganda: conquering the moon, and then conquering the earth from the moon. Without any scientific basis, imperialists fantasize about the "strategic value" of the moon and fantasize about "attacking any target on the earth from the moon." This is precisely a reflection of its weakness in reality and a reflection of its "science" going to a dead end. The book absurdly renders this dream of the beast before its death. It also believes that this illusory war "may become an international or interstellar issue of concern to everyone in a thousand years." (Page 111) In the author's view, the imperialist sinful life and the resulting possibility of war are not already on the verge of death and will be completely eliminated, but can continue until a thousand years later!

The third mistake of this book is that it blindly accepts the anti-Soviet propaganda of imperialism without any critical ability. For example: "The scientists hired (!) by the Soviet Union have recently completed the long-range shooting test of the V-2... Due to the success of remote control, every shot is accurate." Isn't this a war incitement of US imperialism to frighten the people of imperialist countries? For example, it adds an editor's note after the above: "If a war breaks out, the enemy's rockets will all fly from thousands of miles away." (Page 52) Look, the author openly refers to the great fortress of peace, the Soviet Union, as the "enemy" in the tone of US imperialism!

In another place, the author cited an imperialist rumor saying: "Previously reported that there were mysterious missiles in the Swedish sky, perhaps they were their (note: referring to the Soviet Union) achievements." (Page 14) It is so absurd that a scientific work cites imperialist rumors as the basis for narration without any attitude of seeking truth from facts!

Based on the above, the mistakes of this book are very serious. From the mistakes of this book, general authors can understand: in the writing of books on science and technology, it is very necessary to improve political vigilance and carefully distinguish and grasp materials. At the same time, general publishers can also understand: it is also very necessary to add strict review to books on science and technology, whether they are first editions or re-editions.

Editor's note: We have forwarded this criticism to the Opening Up Bookstore. The bookstore made a review and admitted the serious negligence of not checking the book when it was reprinted in Beijing in February of this year, and immediately stopped selling the book "Rocket." We believe that such problems are not unique to the book "Rocket." Similar errors also exist in some natural science books, although the nature and degree may be different. To eliminate the reactionary thoughts of imperialism and enrich the thoughts of patriotism and internationalism in natural science books is an important topic for the publishing industry.

### 反对替帝国主义宣传的“火箭”

　　反对替帝国主义宣传的“火箭”
    张以棣著  开明书店一九五一年三月再版
    靳新楚
    开明书店出版的《开明青年丛书》，其中有很多种对青年读者学习自然科学和社会科学是有一定的帮助的。但这套丛书之一的《火箭》，却是一本内容非常荒谬的书。
    全书十二章，概述了火箭的历史，飞行原理、构造、燃料、遥控制，以及火箭研究、使用的现在情况与未来发展。作者已经了解到：“目前的火箭大半是为军事用途而设计的。它的功用，只不过将破坏性的物质，投送到目标地域去，因此对于大多数的人们，火箭究竟有何种意义，颇成为疑问。”“但是我们深信，在不久的将来，火箭的研究工作，就会转到与全体人类有益的途径上去。”（七一页）如果作者能从这一认识出发，适当地掌握、处理书中的材料，那么这一本通俗的科学著作至少不会是十分有害的。可是作者在写作过程中控制不住他的材料——主要是美帝国主义的材料，作了那些材料的俘虏；就使这本书违反了科学研究的企图，变成了鼓吹战争、宣传帝国主义征服世界的狂妄的唯武器论，变成了恐吓世界和平人民的极端有害的读物。
    本书第一个错误是：全书到处歌颂着法西斯德国和美帝国主义者制造杀人武器的“成绩”。作者说：“德国所做的研究工作范围很广……。所完成的飞弹也很多…。其中最著名的当然是Ｖ——２。”（十二页）“德国人因为集中全力研究，所以有这样好的成绩。”（十三页）“德国人在火箭的研究上，功绩最大。”（五八页）“在这次战后，美国为研究火箭，曾把这种火箭（按：指Ｖ——２）运去研究，并且还仿制了几具，由此可看到设计的成功。”（六二页）“美国加州理工学院喷射推进研究室，研究更为深入。”（四八页）“美国最近新制的一种火箭，预计性能较Ｖ—２还要好。”（六八页）总之，它给人一种荒谬的印象：反动的、落后的、黑暗的美德法西斯主义国家是火箭“科学”最发达的国家！不必谈到苏联科学（主要的不是用于战争的）研究的成绩超出了美国，即使专就帝国主义国家而言，法西斯德国研究火箭著有“功绩”是为了战争，为了杀害人类（作者说是为了“报复”），美帝国主义者这样做，是为了什么呢？自然也是为了战争。这样的“科学研究”是理应痛加批判的，作者却把这种法西斯侵略性的“科学”歌颂为“国防科学工作”！一个为法西斯主义服务的德国人因火箭实验室爆炸炸死了，作者却说他“殉难”，痛惜他“殉”了帝国主义侵略政策的“难”！（十—十一页）
    本书第二个错误，是被帝国主义的唯武器论吓住了。他写道：“下次大战中最可怕的武器，据一般战略家的意见，为原子弹火箭”，而且“几无防御可能”。这不是帝国主义的原子夸大狂的老调吗？对于现代科学已经证明的任何原子与火箭之类的最新武器，都不能决定战争胜负这一点，对于任何种的武器都可用同样的武器加以回敬这一点，作者几乎完全没有考虑到。
    作者甚至贩运那样荒诞不经的战争宣传：征服月球，然后从月球上来征服地球。帝国主义者没有任何科学根据，幻想什么月球的《战略价值》，幻想“从月球攻击地球上的任何目标”，这正是它在现实中软弱无力的反映，正是它的“科学”走上绝路的反映。这种野兽在垂死前的幻梦，本书都给荒谬地渲染出来。它还以为这种虚幻的战争，“在千年后也许都会变成大家关心的国际或星际问题。”（一一一页）在作者看来，帝国主义的罪恶的生命和由此而来的战争可能性，并不是已经濒临死亡的，就要根本消灭的，却还可以持续到千年以后呢！
    本书第三个错误是对于帝国主义的反苏宣传盲目地接受过来，没有丝毫批判能力。例如：“苏联所雇用（！）之科学家，最近已完成Ｖ—２之远距离射击试验。………由于遥远控制之成功，每发必中。”这不是美帝国主义恐吓帝国主义国家的人民的战争煽动是什么？又如，它接着上面的话加按语道：“如战争一旦发生，敌人的火箭全从千里外飞来。”（五二页）请看，作者是公然用美帝国主义的口气把伟大的和平堡垒的苏联称作“敌人”了！
    在另一处地方，作者又引用帝国主义的谣言称：“以前报载瑞典上空有神秘飞弹，也许就是他们（按指苏联）的成绩了。”（十四页）一本科学性著作竟毫无实事求是的态度地引用帝国主义的谣言来作叙述根据，这是何等的荒谬！
    根据上述，本书的错误是十分严重的。从这一本书的错误，一般著作者可以了解：在科学技术一类书的写作中，提高政治性的警惕，审慎地区别、掌握材料，是非常必要的。同时，一般出版者也可以了解：对科学技术一类书籍，不论它是初版的或是再版的，加上严密的审订工夫也是十分必要的。
    编者按：这篇批评我们曾转给开明书店，该店作了检讨，承认本年二月间本书在北京重版时未加检查的严重疏忽，并立即将《火箭》一书停售。我们认为这样的问题并不是《火箭》一书所独有的，某些自然科学书籍中也存在着类似的错误，虽然性质和程度可能有所不同。在自然科学书籍中肃清帝国主义的反动思想，充实爱国主义与国际主义的思想，是出版界的一个重要的课题。
