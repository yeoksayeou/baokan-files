Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

Hengyang Railway Administration
　　Has Strengthened Coal Management Work

Editor:

We sincerely accept the criticism made by Comrade Shou Zhu in the People's Daily readers' letter section on May 16th regarding the incident of some crew members in the Wuchang, Yueyang, and Changsha locomotive depots of our bureau taking advantage of loopholes to claim more coal. We are now sending our review and prevention methods as follows:

The Wuchang, Yueyang, and Changsha locomotive depots currently have a total coal deficit of 1,027 tons. The reasons are: (1) The person in charge did not pay enough attention to coal management. The fuel management method was newly promulgated, and the leadership of these three locomotive depots did not pay enough attention to it. The fuel administrators were not proficient in their work, and their control of coal supply was not accurate enough. (2) The coal and water car's measuring scale was not up to standard. The water tank scales for various types of locomotives are different. The Ministry of Railways stipulated in February of last year that each section should imitate and install them, and if the dimensions are different, they should be re-measured and calculated. However, some self-made water tank scales are still inaccurate, and some have not been installed at all. (3) The specific gravity of Xiangjiang coal was improperly determined. The Wuchang, Yueyang, and Changsha locomotive depots mostly use Xiangjiang coal. Originally, after testing by each section, the average specific gravity was determined to be 945 kilograms per cubic meter. After the Wuchang Sub-bureau pointed out that the specific gravity of Xiangjiang coal was improperly determined, the fuel section sent people to each section to conduct joint tests and revised the standard to 995 kilograms per cubic meter. (4) Crew members taking advantage of loopholes. A few crew members, in order to show their coal-saving achievements, made the remaining coal in the coal and water car concave in the middle and raised it at the edge of the scale before loading coal, in an attempt to take advantage of loopholes. There were also crew members like those on locomotive No. 888, as cited by Comrade Shou Zhu, who put a large amount of coal into the firebox when loading coal. These are all opportunistic behaviors. This should be attributed to insufficient education of crew members by competent authorities at all levels.

We accept Comrade Shou Zhu's suggestion, and have dealt with this matter, strengthened publicity and education in response to the above-mentioned errors; and have re-tested and revised the specific gravity of Xiangjiang coal, and the Wuchang Sub-bureau has independently corrected the unreasonable scales, and also stipulated methods to prevent crew members from taking advantage of loopholes when loading coal.

### 衡阳铁路管理局  已加强用煤管理工作

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　衡阳铁路管理局
　  已加强用煤管理工作编辑同志：
    我们对瘦竹同志在五月十六日人民日报读者来信专页批评我局武昌、岳阳、长沙等机务段某些乘务员取巧多领煤的事件，表示诚恳接受。现在将我们的检讨和防止办法函覆如下：
    武昌、岳阳、长沙三机务段，现在共亏煤一千零二十七吨。原因是：（一）负责人不够重视燃煤管理工作。燃料管理办法是新颁行的，这三个机务段的领导上对此均不够重视。各燃料管理员对业务不熟练，给煤工作掌握更不够准确。（二）煤水车上的量煤标尺不合标准。各型机车水柜标尺不同，铁道部去年二月间曾规定由各段仿照安装，如尺寸不同，即应重新测量计算。但有少数自制的水柜标尺仍不准确，有的根本没有装。（三）湘江煤比重定得不当。武昌、岳阳、长沙三机务段大部分用湘江煤，原先经各段试验，决定平均每立方公尺为九百四十五公斤。武昌分局指出湘江煤比重定得不当以后，燃料科又派人至各段会同试验，并修定标准每立方公尺为九百九十五公斤。（四）乘务员取巧。少数乘务员为了表现节煤成绩，在上煤前使煤水车剩余之煤中间凹下，靠边缘标尺处弄高，以图取巧。还有如瘦竹同志所举八八八号机车乘务员，在上煤时往火室内投入大量煤炭，这都是取巧行为。这应该归咎于各级主管部门对乘务员教育不够。
    我们接受瘦竹同志建议，对此事进行了处理，针对上述错误加强宣传教育；并已重新试验改订了湘江煤的比重，以及由武昌分局自行纠正了不合理的标尺，同时还规定了防止乘务员在上煤时取巧的办法。
