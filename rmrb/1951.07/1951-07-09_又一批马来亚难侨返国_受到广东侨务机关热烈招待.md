    Warmly Received by Guangdong Overseas Chinese Affairs Agencies
    [Report from this newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency: The eighth group of 851 overseas Chinese, illegally deported by the British colonial government of Malaya, arrived in Guangzhou on June 28th. They were warmly welcomed and received by the Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City Overseas Chinese Affairs Agencies and returned overseas Chinese organizations. After returning to Guangzhou, the refugees enthusiastically participated in the Chinese people's movement to resist America and aid Korea. They donated a total of over RMB 9 million as funds for purchasing "Overseas Chinese" airplanes.
    The fifth, sixth, and seventh groups of 2,004 Malayan overseas Chinese who had been illegally deported and returned to Guangzhou earlier have all been properly settled by the People's Government. More than 1,200 people have returned to their hometowns to participate in production, and some have even been allocated land. Others have been recommended to work in government agencies or factories. Recently, the Guangzhou Office of the Returned Refugee Affairs Committee received 500 letters from these returned refugees. The letters unanimously expressed their gratitude and love for Chairman Mao and the People's Government.

    受到广东侨务机关热烈招待
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：被马来亚英国殖民政府非法驱逐出境的第八批华侨八百五十一人，于六月二十八日抵达广州。他们受到广东省和广州市侨务机关和归国华侨团体的热烈欢迎和招待。难侨们在返抵广州后，就热情地参加了祖国人民的抗美援朝运动。他们一共捐献了人民币九百多万元，作为购买“华侨号”飞机的基金。
    较早回到广州的第五、六、七三批被非法驱逐的马来亚华侨二千零四人，都已得到人民政府的妥善安置。其中一千二百余人已回乡参加生产，有的人并已分得了土地。另一部分已介绍到政府机关或工厂工作。最近归国难侨处理委员会广州办事处接到这些归国难侨的来信五百封。信中一致对毛主席和人民政府表示感谢和热爱。
