　　A Tour of the Northeast Revolutionary Martyrs Memorial Hall

　　In Harbin, on "Yiman Street," named after the martyr Zhao Yiman, stands a magnificent silver-white building, which is the Northeast Revolutionary Martyrs Memorial Hall, rebuilt by the people of Northeast China in October 1948. On the front wall of the Martyrs Hall hangs a red giant plaque, more than a丈 tall, with three lines of golden characters inscribed by Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people: "Communism is irresistible! A single spark can start a prairie fire! Long live the fallen martyrs!"

　　These philosophical words shining with the light of truth summarize the immortal achievements of the Communist Party members and the people of Northeast China in striving for the liberation of the Chinese nation.

　　The last words of Comrade Luo Dengxian, one of the outstanding leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, are also hung on the wall inside the hall. In 1931, after the "September 18th Incident," he firmly called on the Communist Party members at an emergency meeting of senior cadres of the CCP in northern Manchuria to be with the people of Northeast China and drive out the Japanese invaders. From then on, the Communist Party members in Northeast China organized armed forces in the vast rural areas and mountainous areas to establish anti-Japanese guerrilla bases. These guerrilla teams grew stronger and stronger in combat, gradually developing into the Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Army, which persisted in the anti-Japanese war in Northeast China and deterred the enemy.

　　The Martyrs Hall preserves the head of General Yang Jingyu. General Yang Jingyu gloriously died on February 13, 1940, in a large forest south of Mengjiang County in the Changbai Mountains. At that time, the anti-Japanese forces were outnumbered and surrounded by Japanese troops on all sides. He held guns in both hands and resisted resolutely until the last drop of blood was shed. After his sacrifice, the enemy brutally dissected his body and found that there was not a grain of food in his stomach, only some bark and grass roots. His head was sent to Changchun, the then puppet capital, by the enemy. In 1949, on the ninth anniversary of his death, the hero's head was reverently welcomed into the Martyrs Hall by the people and received permanent mourning.

　　Every martyr who gloriously sacrificed in the years of battle died so generously, so heroically, and so fully demonstrated the heroic spirit of the Communists. Tong Changrong, secretary of the Jidong Special Committee of the Communist Party of China and one of the founders of the Dongman Guerrilla, hid in a secret camp in a large forest in Wangqing County, Jilin Province, after suffering from severe lung disease and hemiplegia. Finally, he was discovered by the enemy. He and a Korean nurse who was responsible for taking care of him persisted in resisting until the last bullet and died heroically in the snow. General Chen Hanzhang, a young general of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army, had both legs broken and his right hand injured in a battle on December 8, 1940. However, when the enemy finally caught him, gouged out his eyes, and knocked out his teeth, he still scolded the enemy loudly and died unyieldingly. In March 1938, Zhang Zonglan, the women's minister of the Jiaomusi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and a 19-year-old female Communist Party member, and her entire family heroically died in order to protect the secrets of the Party. … This is part of the countless heroic deeds displayed in the Martyrs Hall. The heroic Chinese Communists and the armed forces they led won the greatest trust of the people with their loyalty to the motherland and the people. During the years of dark rule by the Japanese invaders, the people of Northeast China risked their lives to secretly transport food and weapons to the guerrillas. A farmer named Li Laosan in the guerrilla area of Ning'an County, Songjiang Province, was arrested and severely tortured by the enemy on his way back from delivering food to the guerrillas. Finally, his stomach was cut open and his intestines flowed out, but he never revealed a word about the activities of the anti-Japanese forces until his death.

　　In the Martyrs Hall, there are also many souvenirs and written historical materials on display. Three glass cabinets in the exhibition room are filled with the tools used by the anti-Japanese fighters in combat and work. There are two rusted single-edged swords of Xu Kuirao, the leader of the guerrillas. He used these two single-edged swords to intercept the enemy many times in the grass outside Shangzhi County, Songjiang Province, forcing the Japanese invaders to dare not enter the mountains and forests; there are daggers used by the guerrillas to attack the Datong Company, the Japanese invaders' garrison in Huadian County, which once pierced through the chests of five Japanese invaders; there are large axes used by the soldiers of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army to cut trees and open roads during marches and to cut wood to build camps during stationing, and various iron bowls and copper bowls they used to cook and drink water; and there are those worn-out rubber shoes and fur boots that have been worn for countless years and have traveled through countless mountains and plains.

　　In addition, there are commemorative items sent by people from all over the country, each of which is engraved with the deep feelings of the people of Northeast China for the Communist Party and the people's armed forces it leads.

　　东北革命烈士纪念馆巡礼
    新华社记者  方言、李俊
    在哈尔滨市，以先烈赵一曼的名字命名的“一曼街”上，矗立着一座巍峨壮丽的银白色大楼，这就是东北人民在一九四八年十月间改建而成的东北革命烈士纪念馆。在烈士馆的正面墙壁上，悬挂着一幅高达丈余的红色巨匾，上面镶有中国人民领袖毛泽东主席亲笔题写的三行金色大字：“共产主义是不可抗御的！星星之火可以燎原！死难烈士万岁！”
    这闪耀着真理光辉的哲言，概括了共产党员和东北人民为争取中华民族解放的不朽业迹。
    杰出的中共领导者之一——罗登贤烈士的遗言也悬挂在馆内的墙上。一九三一年，“九一八”事变发生后，他便在中共北满高级干部紧急会议上，坚定地号召共产党员们要与东北人民在一起，把日本侵略者驱逐干净。从那时起，东北的共产党员们就在广大农村和山区中组织武装部队，建立抗日游击根据地。这些游击队在战斗中不断成长壮大，逐渐发展成为坚持东北抗战、震慑敌胆的东北抗日联军。
    烈士馆中保存有杨靖宇将军的头颅。杨靖宇将军是在一九四零年二月十三日在长白山区蒙江县城南的一个大山林里光荣殉国的。那时，抗日部队因为寡不敌众，陷入日寇四面包围之中，他双手持枪射击，坚决抵抗，直到流尽了最后一滴血。他牺牲了以后，敌人残暴地解剖了他的尸体，发现他的肠胃里没有一粒粮食，有的只是一些树皮和草根。他的头颅被敌人送到当时的伪京长春。一九四九年，他死难九周年时，这颗英雄的头颅为人民虔敬地迎入了烈士馆，受到人们永久的悼念。
    在战斗的年月里光荣牺牲的烈士们，每一个人都是死得那样慷慨，那样壮烈，那样充分地表现出共产党人的英雄气节。中共吉东特委书记、东满游击队的创始人之一童长荣，在得了肺病和半身不遂的重症后，隐蔽在吉林省汪清县一个大森林的密营中，最后被敌人发觉，他和一位负责照顾他的朝鲜籍女护士一同坚持抗击到最后一颗子弹，在雪地上英勇牺牲。抗日联军的一位青年将领陈翰章将军，在一九四零年十二月八日的一次战斗中，两腿都被打断，右手也负了伤，然而就在敌人最后捉住他，挖出他的眼睛、敲掉他的牙齿的时候，他仍旧大声痛骂敌人，不屈而死。一九三八年三月，中共佳木斯市市委妇女部长、十九岁的女共产党员张宗兰和她的全家，为了保守党的秘密，一家四口都壮烈殉难。……这是在烈士馆里陈列的无数英雄事迹的一部分。英勇的中国共产党人和他们所领导的武装部队，以这种对祖国对人民的忠诚，取得了人民最大的信仰。在日寇黑暗统治的年代里，东北人民冒着生命危险，偷偷为游击队输送粮食和武器。松江省宁安县游击区有一个叫李老三的农民，他在给游击队送粮的归途中被敌人抓去严刑拷问，最后肚子被割开，肠子都流了出来，但他至死没有泄露一句关于抗日部队活动的秘密。
    在烈士馆里，还陈列着许多纪念品和文字史料。陈列室内的三个玻璃橱中，摆满了抗日战士们战斗和工作的用具，里面有游击队长许魁耀的两把钝锈了的单刀，他曾经拿着这两把单刀，在松江省尚志县郊外的草丛中多次截击敌人，迫使日寇不敢进入山林一步；有游击队员们攻打桦甸县日寇驻地大同公司所用的匕首，它曾经穿透过五个日寇的胸膛；有抗日联军战士们行军时砍树开路、驻军时伐木造营的大斧头，和他们煮饭、喝水用的各种铁碗、铜碗；还有那不知穿过多少年月、踏过多少高山平原的破旧的胶鞋和靰鞡。
    此外，还陈列着各地人民送来的纪念物品，每一件物品都铭刻着东北人民对于共产党及其领导的人民武装部队的深厚感情。
