Editor's Note: The experience of Nanjing in universally carrying out and inspecting the Patriotic Pact movement is good and worth referring to by various regions. The Nanjing leadership, after inspection, specifically summarized several basic experiences. This is absolutely necessary because it allows them to find the rules for carrying out the Patriotic Pact movement from the inspection work, guide the work, and educate the cadres. In order to continue strengthening the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, all regions should comprehensively and on a large scale launch a mass movement to inspect and revise the Patriotic Pacts.

　　Since the beginning of March, Nanjing has universally launched a movement to sign Patriotic Pacts. According to statistics from the end of June, over 60 percent of the city's people have signed Patriotic Pacts, summarizing the experience of signing and implementing them.

According to inspections, the Patriotic Pacts have played a significant role in promoting the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and production, work, and study. For example, the Nanjing Radio Factory, through the formulation and implementation of the Patriotic Pact, enabled the factory to complete its "Red May" production task five days ahead of schedule. Fourteen out of seventeen groups in five workshops exceeded their production targets, and fifty-two rationalization proposals were made. Li Fuquan, a farmer in Hengba Village in the suburbs of the city, greatly raised his family's patriotic consciousness after formulating and implementing a family Patriotic Pact, formulating a plan to increase grain production by forty jin per mu and donate it to purchase weapons, thereby promoting the mutual aid groups in the entire village and reforming slackers. After teachers and students of universities and middle schools formulated and implemented Patriotic Pacts, they generally established correct teaching ideas and strengthened teacher-student unity. In the business community, Patriotic Pacts not only encouraged them to continue to maintain the glory of collectively paying taxes, but also changed the phenomenon of sluggish business and disunity in some industries. Among residents, Patriotic Pacts have brought a new look to many residential sections, and the bad habits of the old society have gradually been eliminated. For example, in the Guyi Lang North Section of District One of the city, out of the original 141 households, nine were addicted to or selling opium, and sixteen lived by gambling; out of the 643 people in the entire section, about 400 often gambled, and tax arrears accounted for nearly 90 percent of the taxable households. Since the implementation of the Patriotic Pact, no one is addicted to drugs, no one gambles, and no household owes taxes. In the Xishui West Street West Section of District Four, in the past, 14 out of 25 families in the entire section had radios, and 14 listened to "Voice of America" and spread rumors; now, the shortwave of all 25 radios have been automatically cut off or sealed off, and the rumors in the section have also disappeared.

Patriotic Pacts have also become a huge driving force in various movements. In terms of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, most of the units that formulated Patriotic Pacts have formulated specific content for continuing to fight against counter-revolutionaries. Some residents even stipulated in their own pacts to assist the government in monitoring counter-revolutionaries under control, and even wrote the names of the counter-revolutionaries under control in them. In terms of patriotic actions to resist America and aid Korea, before the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association issued the "June 1st" call, many units had already stipulated their monthly donation plans and figures in the pacts. For example, in more than one-third of the family Patriotic Pacts of residents in Qiaodong Street in District Six, the amount and method of monthly donations to comfort the Chinese and Korean soldiers were stipulated.

The Nanjing Resist America, Aid Korea Branch, in implementing the "June 1st" call of the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association, mobilized the Resist America, Aid Korea branches in various sectors and districts in late June to universally inspect the situation of the people in all sectors formulating and implementing Patriotic Pacts.

After inspection, the city has summarized the following points of experience:

First, conducting sufficient patriotic propaganda and preparation work before formulating the Patriotic Pact is the primary key to formulating a good and well-implemented Patriotic Pact. For example, before formulating the Patriotic Pact, the leadership of the Nanjing Radio Factory conducted sufficient patriotic education for all employees, held three major classes, and launched group discussions, which laid the ideological foundation for the factory to formulate the Patriotic Pact. Before formulating the Patriotic Pact, the activists of the Guyi Lang North Section residents in District One of the city underwent two weeks of learning and publicity on "How to Love the Motherland," and used real people and real events to educate the masses when preparing to sign the Patriotic Pact. The Patriotic Pact was signed on the basis of the general maturity of the masses' thinking.

Second, in the method of formulating Patriotic Pacts, the focus must be on grassroots production units or work, study, and life units, and formulated according to the people's level of awareness and specific circumstances. Only in this way can the Patriotic Pact formulated be specific and feasible. Like the Nanjing Radio Factory, the focus was on production teams, and the residents of Qiaodong Street in District Six of the city focused on a family, held group or family meetings according to their own team or family situation, and formulated specific patriotic action plans based on their own shortcomings and patriotic requirements. Therefore, it is well implemented.

Third, after the Patriotic Pact is formulated, a regular inspection system must be established, summarized regularly, and constantly supplemented and revised according to new situations, in order to ensure the implementation of the Patriotic Pact; only in this way can the Patriotic Pact always maintain lively and fresh content, and constantly inspire the people's patriotic enthusiasm. He Yongzhang's group in the Nanjing Radio Factory, due to the creation of a five-person promotion and inspection team, guaranteed that the group exceeded the output by 1,119 hours in the Red May. Residents of the Xishui West Street created a method of regularly combining the central work of the section and selecting one of the Patriotic Pact to universally inspect, so that the residents of the section achieved significant results in implementing the Patriotic Pact. Li Fuquan's family Patriotic Pact has been revised and improved three times with the development of the Resist America, Aid Korea Patriotic Movement and the improvement of his own political consciousness. The donation plan has been increased from 40 percent to 100 percent. Therefore, it has become a model for suburban farmers in implementing the Patriotic Pact.

Fourth, inspecting the Patriotic Pact must be combined with commendation and criticism in order to consolidate and promote the achievements in implementing the Patriotic Pact. Like the Guyi Lang North Section and Xishui West Street, Qiaodong Street and the Shuilu Industry Guild, they all used street blackboards or mass gatherings to promptly commend and criticize good and bad examples of implementing the Patriotic Pact. The Radio Factory also created an award system, regularly selecting models and giving rewards after each monthly summary. Therefore, it strengthened the masses' sense of responsibility for conscientiously implementing the Patriotic Pact and encouraged the masses' enthusiasm for implementing the Patriotic Pact.

All contract units that violate these principles and fail to absorb these experiences have shortcomings in the formulation and implementation of the Patriotic Pact, which become a mere formality. Through this inspection, Nanjing also found that many units, due to insufficient attention to the Patriotic Pact by the leadership, failed to conduct good publicity and specific leadership, and the masses did not have a good understanding of the Patriotic Pact. Therefore, many shortcomings were generated in the formulation and implementation of the Patriotic Pact. Some are: the content of the Patriotic Pact is either empty political slogans or pure life pacts, failing to raise the pact to the ideological level of patriotism, nor combining it with its own main business, thus making it difficult for the masses to implement specifically, or failing to give play to the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses. Some are: the articles of the Patriotic Pact are too long, making it impossible for the contractors to remember; or the contracting unit is too large, and cannot be tailored to specific circumstances, thus hindering the implementation of the Patriotic Pact. Some have adopted a paternalistic approach when signing the contract. Some have "everything is fine" after signing, without inspection, or the inspection failed to properly grasp criticism and praise, and only made punishments, resulting in the opposite effect and causing dissatisfaction among the masses.

When Nanjing convened the Resist America, Aid Korea Representative Conference, the branch organized units with successful experiences in implementing the Patriotic Pact, such as the Radio Factory and Li Fuquan's family, to make typical reports at the meeting, calling on all contracting units to learn from them and launch challenge competitions to promote the Patriotic Pact movement.

　　南京市普遍检查爱国公约
    取得领导爱国公约运动基本经验
    编者按：南京市普遍开展和检查爱国公约运动的经验是好的，值得各地参考。南京市领导机关经过检查，具体地总结了几条基本经验，这是完全必要的，这样就从检查工作中找到了开展爱国公约运动的规律，指导了工作同时也教育了干部。为了继续加强抗美援朝运动，各地都应全面地大规模地开展一个检查和修订爱国公约的群众运动。
    南京市自三月初起，即普遍展开签订爱国公约的运动。据六月底的检查统计，全市百分之六十以上的人民，都已签订了爱国公约，总结出签订和执行爱国公约的经验。
    根据检查，爱国公约在推动抗美援朝运动和生产、工作、学习上，起了很大的作用。如该市有线电厂，通过了爱国公约的订立和贯彻执行，使全厂红五月生产任务提前五天完成。五个工场十七个小组，超额完成生产任务的有十四个小组，合理化建议达到五十二件。该市郊区横霸村农民李福全，订立和执行家庭爱国公约以后，大大提高了全家的爱国觉悟，订出了每亩增产粮食四十斤捐献购买武器的计划，从而推动了全村互助组，改造了懒汉。大专中学师生订立和执行爱国公约后，一般地都树立了正确的教学思想，加强了师生团结。在工商界，爱国公约不仅鼓舞他们继续保持了集体缴税的光荣，而且改变了部分行业营业不振、不团结的现象。在居民当中，爱国公约使许多居民段呈现了崭新的面貌，不良的旧社会风气逐渐扫除。像该市一区估衣廊北段，原来一百四十一户中，吸、卖鸦片的就有九户，靠赌博吃饭的有十六户；全段六百四十三人中，常赌钱的就有四百人左右，欠税的占应纳税户近百分之九十。自执行爱国公约后，现在已无一人吸毒，无一人赌博，无一户欠税。四区水西门大街西段，过去全段二十五家有收音机，有十四架收听“美国之音”，并散布谣言；现在这二十五架收音机的短波，全都自动剪掉或封掉，该段谣言也随之灭迹。
    爱国公约在各种运动中，也成了巨大的推动力量。表现在镇压反革命方面，订立爱国公约的单位，绝大部分都订了继续与反革命分子作斗争的具体内容，有的居民甚至在自己公约上订出协助政府监视被管制反革命分子的条文，并把被管制的反革命分子的姓名也写在里面。表现在抗美援朝的爱国行动上，在抗美援朝总会发出“六一”号召以前，很多单位都已在公约上订出了自己每月的捐献计划和数字。如六区桥东街居民三分之一以上的家庭爱国公约里，都订了每月捐献慰劳中朝战士的款额和办法。
    南京市抗美援朝分会，在贯彻执行抗美援朝总会“六一”号召时，曾在六月下旬动员各界各区抗美援朝支会普遍检查了各界人民订立与执行爱国公约的情况。
    经过检查，该市已总结出如下几点经验：
    第一、在订立爱国公约之前，进行充分的爱国主义的宣传酝酿工作，是爱国公约订的好、执行得好的首要关键。如该市有线电厂在订立爱国公约之前，领导上对全厂职工进行了充分的爱国主义教育，上过三次大课，并且展开了小组讨论，这就为该厂订立爱国公约打下了思想基础。该市一区估衣廊北段居民积极分子，在订立爱国公约之前，经过了两个星期“如何爱祖国”的学习和宣传，在酝酿签订爱国公约时，又用实人实事来教育群众。在群众思想普遍成熟的基础上，才签订爱国公约。
    第二、在订立爱国公约的方法上，必须以基层生产单位或工作、学习、生活单位为重点，根据人民的觉悟程度，和具体情况来订。这样订出的爱国公约才能具体可行。像该市有线电厂，都是以生产小组为重点，该市六区桥东街居民，都是以一个家庭为重点，根据自己小组或家庭情况，举行小组或家庭会议，针对自己缺点和爱国要求订出了具体的爱国行动纲领。因此，就执行得好。
    第三、爱国公约订立后，必须建立经常的检查制度，定期总结，不断根据新情况加以补充和修正，才能保证爱国公约的贯彻执行；才能使爱国公约经常保持生动新鲜的内容，随时鼓舞着人民的爱国热情。该市有线电厂贺咏璋小组，由于创造了五人推动检查小组，分工检查的办法，保证该小组在红五月产量超额一千一百十九小时。水西门大街西段居民，由于创造了定期结合本段中心工作，选择爱国公约中的一条，普遍检查的方法，使该段居民执行爱国公约获得了显著成绩。农民李福全的家庭爱国公约，随着抗美援朝爱国运动的发展，和自己政治觉悟的提高，修改提高过三次。捐献计划由百分之四十提高到百分之一百。因而成为郊区农民执行爱国公约中的模范。
    第四、检查爱国公约，必须结合表扬批评，才能巩固发扬执行爱国公约的成绩。像估衣廊北段和水西门大街西段，桥东街和水炉业同业公会，都利用街道黑板报或群众集会，对执行爱国公约的好坏事例，及时进行了表扬批评，有线电厂并创造了评奖制度，在每月总结以后，定期评选模范，给予奖励，因此，也就加强了群众认真执行爱国公约的责任感，鼓舞了群众贯彻执行爱国公约的热情。
    凡是违反以上这些原则，没有吸取这些经验的订约单位，爱国公约的订立与执行，就有缺点，就流于形式。南京市通过这次检查，也发现不少单位，由于领导上对爱国公约重视不足，没有很好进行宣传和具体领导，群众对爱国公约认识不够，因而在订立执行爱国公约时，就产生了很多缺点。有的是：爱国公约内容不是空洞的政治口号，就是单纯的生活公约，不将公约提高到爱国主义的思想水平，也不与本身主要业务结合，因而使群众难于具体执行，或是不能发挥群众的爱国热情。有的是：爱国公约条文订得太长，使订约人无法记忆；或订约单位太大，不能切合具体情况，因而妨碍了爱国公约的贯彻执行。有的是：在订约时采取了包办代替的方式，有的订了以后“万事大吉”，也不检查，或检查时没有能适当地掌握批评与表扬，只单纯作了处罚，结果起了相反的作用，招致群众不满。
    南京市在召开抗美援朝代表会议时，曾由分会组织了执行爱国公约具有成绩经验的有线电厂、农民李福全家庭等单位，在会上作了典型报告，号召各订约单位向他们学习，展开挑战竞赛，来推进爱国公约运动。
