　　The Important Significance of Preparing to Convene the North China County Magistrate Conference

    The North China Affairs Department of the Central People's Government is preparing to convene the first North China County Magistrate Conference, which will have important significance for promoting the development of political power construction in North China and throughout the country in the future. The main content of this meeting is to implement the Central People's Government and the Government Administration Council's repeated instructions on consolidating and developing the people's democratic dictatorship, further strengthen the people's democratic political power system in the North China region, and provide a stronger guarantee for the development of various construction tasks in the North China region. This meeting will also incidentally resolve some existing problems in the work of preferential treatment for military dependents in various parts of North China, and summarize and exchange experiences in the work of preferential treatment for military dependents.
    With the deepening of the three major movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the improvement of the masses' awareness, the work of strengthening the construction of people's democratic political power has become one of the important political tasks. Therefore, this preparation for convening the North China County Magistrate Conference is very timely and necessary.
    As early as the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, the Communist Party of China and the people's army under its leadership, together with the people of North China, shared life and death and created anti-Japanese democratic base areas. Since then, the people of North China have had their own political power. Throughout the Anti-Japanese War and the People's Liberation War, due to the heroic struggle of the people's army in supporting the government and cherishing the people, the continuous improvement of the people's political awareness, and the hard work of the political power work cadres, the people's democratic political power in the North China region played a huge role. It not only gloriously completed the arduous tasks of supporting the Anti-Japanese War and then supporting the National Liberation War, ensuring the victory of the revolutionary war; but also led the people to implement land reform, restore and develop production, so that the people of North China were liberated from feudal oppression and improved their lives. Therefore, the people's democratic political power in the North China region has been increasingly consolidated and developed.
    However, it must be pointed out that the work of building people's democratic political power in North China is still lagging behind the development of the objective situation. The objective situation is demanding that we further strengthen various construction tasks, first of all, to further strengthen the construction of democratic political power. However, some of our cadres are now gradually developing the erroneous idea of ​​not caring about politics. One of the specific manifestations of this erroneous idea is the neglect of political power construction. They have not yet truly understood Chairman Mao's theory of people's democratic dictatorship, and have not truly understood the truth that the fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of political power. They do not seem to realize how warmly and urgently the broad revolutionary people demand further strengthening the people's political power, and actively demand further participation in the management of the affairs of their own country. Therefore, in order to strengthen the construction of people's democratic political power, and to prepare for the convening of the North China County Magistrate Conference, sufficient ideological preparation must be carried out.
    All cadres should correctly understand the relationship between political power construction and economic construction. Some cadres ignore the great role of new democratic political power construction in new democratic economic construction, and thus blindly "bury themselves in production," and even regard political power organs as merely organs for leading production. This erroneous understanding must be corrected. Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his speech at the Third People's Congress of Beijing: "Economic construction has now become the central task of our country and people. However, new democratic economic construction must be led and guaranteed by new democratic political power." If "there is no democratization of our country, and no development of new democratic political power, we cannot guarantee the economic development of new democracy and the industrialization of the country." Facts have proved that in places where people's representative meetings are well held, the masses generally believe that they have full democracy and a place for the people to speak freely, which is another "turning over." They believe that without this "turning over" and the dictatorship over counter-revolutionary elements, "production cannot be done well." This should be a great education for our cadres.
    There are also many cadres who do not quite understand that our new democratic political power is not only democratic in essence, but we must also push it further, so that it can be more widely and closely connected with the people of all democratic classes politically and organizationally, and gradually make it complete in organizational form. This is to establish and improve the system of people's representative meetings and people's congresses formulated by Chairman Mao that is completely suitable for China's current national conditions, that is, the fundamental system of the country stipulated in the Common Program, and to make this system as quickly as possible a systematic, regular, and solid system from the bottom up in our country. We must make all cadres understand that the conditions for establishing and improving this system generally already exist sufficiently in old liberated areas like North China. The only question now is how hard we work on this task.
    At present, some places still have some bourgeois old democratic erroneous tendencies, only valuing a certain form of "democracy" without seeking substance. At the same time, on the other hand, there is still the bad style of closed-doorism of acting for others and taking over. These are most evident in the election issues of people's representative meetings in various places. These must be corrected. In addition, there are still many problems in the leading ideology of political power construction work and in the organization and working methods of political power, which should not only be resolved through meetings, but also clarified ideologically in the process of preparing for the meetings.
    The current focus of political power construction is at the county level. Preparing to convene the North China County Magistrate Conference is completely in line with actual needs. The construction of people's democratic political power in North China has a long history of experience. In particular, people's representative meetings of all circles have been held in various places, and the people have initially developed democratic habits. This meeting has also been carefully prepared. We believe that under the direct leadership of the Central People's Government, the construction of political power in North China will definitely be able to move forward from its existing foundation.

### 筹备召开华北县长会议的重要意义

　　筹备召开华北县长会议的重要意义
    中央人民政府华北事务部筹备召开的华北首次县长会议，对于今后华北以及全国各地政权建设工作的推进，将有重要的意义。这个会议的主要内容，是要贯彻中央人民政府和政务院迭次关于巩固与发展人民民主专政的指示，进一步加强华北区人民民主政权制度，使华北区的各项建设工作的发展获得更有力的保障。这个会议也要附带解决目前华北各地优抚工作中存在的一些问题，总结与交流各地优抚工作的经验。
    随着抗美援朝、土地改革和镇压反革命的三大运动的深入和群众觉悟程度的提高，加强人民民主政权建设的工作，已成为重要的政治任务之一。因此这一次华北筹备召开县长会议，是非常适时的和必要的。
    远在抗日战争初期，中国共产党及其领导下的人民军队，就和华北人民在一起，同生死共患难，创立了抗日民主根据地。从那时候起，华北各地就有了人民自己的政权。在整个抗日战争和人民解放战争的时期，由于英勇奋斗的人民军队拥政爱民，由于人民政治觉悟不断提高，由于政权工作干部艰苦努力，使华北区的人民民主政权发挥了巨大力量。它不仅光荣地完成了支援抗日战争及其后支援全国解放战争的繁重任务，保证革命战争的胜利；并且领导人民实行了土地改革，恢复与发展生产，使华北人民从封建压迫下解放出来并改善了自己的生活。因此，华北区的人民民主政权，日益获得了巩固的发展。
    但是必须指出，华北人民民主政权建设的工作，仍然落于客观形势的发展之后。客观的形势正要求我们进一步加强各项建设工作，首先是进一步加强民主政权的建设工作。而我们的有些干部，目前却正逐渐滋长着不问政治的错误思想。这种错误思想的具体表现之一，就是忽视政权建设。他们还没有真正懂得毛主席关于人民民主专政的理论，还没有真正懂得革命的根本问题是政权问题的道理。他们似乎没有觉察到广大的革命人民是怎样热烈地迫切要求进一步加强人民的政权，并积极地要求进一步参加管理人民自己的国家的事务。因此，为了要加强人民民主政权的建设工作，为了筹备召开华北县长会议，必须进行充分的思想准备工作。
    应该使所有的干部正确地认识政权建设与经济建设的关系。有一部分干部忽视新民主主义的政权建设对于新民主主义的经济建设的巨大作用，因而盲目地“埋头生产”，甚至把政权机关看成仅仅是领导生产的机关。这种错误的认识必须加以纠正。刘少奇副主席在北京第三届人民代表会议上的讲话指出：“经济建设现已成为我们国家和人民的中心任务。但是新民主主义的经济建设必须有新民主主义的政权来领导和保障。”如果“没有我们国家的民主化，没有新民主主义的政权的发展，就不能保障新民主主义的经济发展和国家的工业化。”事实证明，凡是开好人民代表会议的地方，群众普遍认为有了充分的民主，有了人民充分说话的地方，就是又一次的“翻身”。他们认为没有这个“翻身”和对于反革命分子的专政，“就不能好好生产”。这应该是对于我们干部的一个很大的教育。
    还有许多干部不甚明白，我们新民主主义的政权，不仅在实质上是民主的，而且我们还必须把它推进一步，使它在政治上和组织上更广泛更密切地联系各民主阶级的人民群众，在组织形式上也逐步地使它完备起来。这就是要把毛主席所制订的完全适合中国目前国情的人民代表会议与人民代表大会制度，即共同纲领上所规定的国家的根本制度建立与健全起来，并使这种制度尽可能迅速地成为我们国家从下至上的系统的经常的巩固的制度。我们必须使所有的干部懂得，要建立与健全这个制度的条件，在像华北这样的老解放区，一般的已经充分存在了。现在的问题只是在于我们对这一工作的努力如何了。
    目前不少地方还存在着一些资产阶级的旧民主主义的错误倾向，只看重某种形式上的“民主”，而不求实质。同时在另一方面，又还存在着包办代替的关门主义的不良作风。这些在各地人民代表会议的选举问题上表现得最为明显。这些都必须加以纠正。此外，在政权建设工作的领导思想上和政权组织及工作方法上也还有很多问题，不但应该通过会议加以解决，而且在会议的筹备过程中，就应该在思想上把它弄清楚。
    当前政权建设的重点在于县，华北筹备召开县长会议，是完全符合于实际需要的。华北人民民主政权的建设已有了长期的经验，特别是各地都已经召开过各界人民代表会议，人民已经初步地有了民主习惯；这次会议，又经过认真准备，我们相信在中央人民政府直接领导下，华北的政权建设一定能从现有的基础上推进一步。
