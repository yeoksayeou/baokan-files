Xinhua News Agency, July 14th: Tokyo News: U.S. imperialism's illegal separate peace with Japan is being accelerated in its preparation. Allison, aide to warmonger Dulles, the U.S. State Department's Far East Affairs advisor, was in Tokyo from late June to early July to conduct final "consultations" with Japanese reactionaries for a separate peace. According to reliable sources, the Japanese reactionaries' opinions on a separate peace were proposed as early as February of this year, during Dulles' stay in Japan, and have been accepted by the U.S. government. In order to manufacture public opinion, U.S. imperialism instigated the Yoshida reactionary government to mobilize a group of lackeys it had nurtured, under the name of the "Liberal Club," to submit a so-called "Declaration of Various Circles in Japan" to Dulles. The signatories included reporters and editors from some reactionary newspapers and periodicals, a small number of comprador capitalists, heads of yellow unions, and counter-communist agents, totaling fifty people.

The "declaration" admitted that the continued occupation of Japan by U.S. troops "is bound to arouse resentment among the Japanese people," and people with a correct national consciousness will be "forced to turn to the Soviet side." However, the Japanese reactionaries used this as a pretext to demand the abolition of various "restrictions" imposed on Japan under U.S. military occupation and to "transfer the substantive power of national administration to the Japanese government" before the peace treaty. In particular, they demanded the withdrawal of the "list of factories" scheduled as reparations to the Allied powers and the "complete abolition of Japan's reparations." When mentioning the territorial issue of Japan, the "declaration" demanded the "return" of the Kuril Islands, expressing that "Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands are prepared to be handed over to U.S. jurisdiction."

The most important part is regarding the so-called "defense of Japan" and the rearmament of Japan. The "declaration" openly proposed: "It is hoped that after the conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan, U.S. troops will continue to be stationed in Japan to defend Japan." And shamelessly hoped that "it is best to clearly indicate that U.S. troops will never abandon Japan under any circumstances and will even be responsible for the defense of Japan after Japan re-arms." It also proposed: "Japan should automatically establish armed forces," and "the armed forces will be national defense forces." "The army that is built should have an independent command system, rather than an international mercenary army. At the same time, the army should not be subject to any restrictions in terms of numbers. However, when necessary, the army may be under the command of the United Nations." And demanded "when building the army, the United States should provide Japan with technical, material, and economic assistance."

The various "demands" mentioned in the "declaration" are in fact completely included in the "Draft Peace Treaty with Japan" proposed by the U.S. government on April 5 of this year and the "U.S.-Japan Military Agreement" that has already been drafted. The purpose of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries playing this kind of double act is nothing more than to try to manufacture public opinion so as to permanently transform Japan into a U.S. colony and military base and make the Japanese people cannon fodder for U.S. imperialism's aggression in Asia.

　　美日反动派加紧单独媾和阴谋
    吉田指使豢养的喽啰制造舆论欺骗人民
    企图变日本为美国殖民地及军事基地
    【新华社十四日讯】东京消息：美帝国主义非法的对日单独媾和正在加速准备中。美国国务院远东事务顾问战贩杜勒斯的助手艾利逊，自六月下旬至七月初在东京与日本反动派为单独媾和作了最后的“会商”。据可靠方面透露，日本反动派对于单独媾和的意见，早在本年二月杜勒斯逗留日本期间，已经提出，并已为美国政府所接受。美帝国主义为制造舆论更嗾使吉田反动政府发动它所豢养的一批喽啰，以“自由主义者俱乐部”的名义，向杜勒斯递呈了一件所谓“日本各界声明”，参加署名的包括一些反动报刊的记者和编辑、少数买办资本家、黄色工会头子和反共特务共五十人。
    该“声明”曾供认：美军继续占领日本，“势必引起日本人民的反感”，有正确民族意识的人们将“被迫投向苏联那一面”。但日本反动派即借此为词，要求取消在美军占领下所加于日本的种种“限制”，在媾和以前“将国家行政实权转交日本政府。”特别是要求撤销预定作为对盟国赔偿的“工厂名单”，“全部取消日本的赔偿”。提到日本的领土问题时“声明”中要求“归还”千岛列岛，表示“冲绳和小笠原群岛准备移交美国管辖”。
    最主要的是关于所谓“防御日本”与重新武装日本的部分。该“声明”公然提出：“希望在对日和约缔结后，美军为继续防御日本而在日本驻扎。”并无耻地希望“最好明确指出美军在任何条件下绝不放弃日本并甚至在日本重新武装后仍然负责日本的防御”。又提出：“日本应自动地建立武装”，“该武装力量将为国防军”，“建成之军队应保有独立的指挥系统，而不是一国际性的雇佣军队。同时，该军队在数量上不应受任何限制。但是，在必要时该军队可处于联合国指挥之下。”并要求“建军时，由美国对日本予以技术、物资和经济上援助”。
    该“声明”中所提各项“要求”，事实上美国政府在本年四月五日所提出的“对日和约草案”，和已经拟定的“美日军事协定”中，已完全包括在内。美日反动派扮演此种双簧之目的，不过是企图制造舆论，以便永远变日本为美国的殖民地和军事基地，并使日本人民为美帝国主义侵略亚洲当炮灰。
