　　Build a Strong National Defense, Defend the Great Motherland!
　　Initial Donations of Over Fifteen Hundred Aircraft from Various Regions
　　Increased Production and Donation Movement Continues to Develop, Number of Donated Aircraft Increases Daily
　　[Reported by this newspaper] The people of the whole country have enthusiastically responded to the call of the China Resist America, Aid Korea General Association, launching an unprecedented patriotic movement to increase production, increase income, and donate aircraft and cannons. As of June 29th, according to incomplete statistics from local newspaper materials, people in various regions have decided to donate and initiated donations of 1,568 aircraft, 100 cannons, 33 anti-aircraft guns, and 7 tanks. (Editor's note: Any donated figures that are not completely certain are calculated according to the lowest figure. For example, the Shandong Resist America, Aid Korea Branch called for the donation of a "Shandong Air Force Division," which was between 120 and 130 aircraft, so it is calculated as 120 aircraft.)
　　This large-scale donation movement demonstrates the high level of patriotism of the people of the whole country. Since the call of the China Resist America, Aid Korea General Association was issued, local Resist America, Aid Korea branches, as well as factories, mines, rural areas, schools, institutions, industrial and commercial circles, and cultural circles, have successively held meetings to specifically discuss how to respond to and implement this patriotic call. At these meetings, each region and unit formulated donation plans to increase production and income based on their respective situations, and immediately began to take action. The Beijing industrial and commercial circles, who were the first in the country to call for the launch of a patriotic donation movement, officially decided on June 10th to donate 27 aircraft (later increasing the donation by 3 aircraft, for a total of 30 aircraft), which played a leading and exemplary role among industrial and commercial circles throughout the country. Following closely behind, the Wuhan industrial and commercial circles decided to donate 30 aircraft on the 13th. By the 13th, the Tianjin industrial and commercial circles had successively decided to donate 30 aircraft. The Shenyang industrial and commercial circles donated 30 aircraft, and the Nanjing industrial and commercial circles donated 10 aircraft. According to extremely incomplete statistics, the people of Northeast China have donated 208 aircraft; the five provinces and two cities of North China have donated a total of 234 aircraft; Hunan has donated 100 fighter jets; and the Shandong Resist America, Aid Korea Branch decided at its expanded meeting on June 10th and 11th to call on the people of the province to donate 120 to 130 aircraft to form a "Shandong Air Force Division." At the representative conference of people from all walks of life in Jiangxi Province on the 20th, it was also decided to donate 81 aircraft, named the "August 1st Air Force Division." The people of Southern Jiangsu decided to donate 120 aircraft, named the "Southern Jiangsu Air Force Division." In addition, people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life in Northwest China have donated 40 aircraft, the people of Northern Anhui have donated 25 aircraft, the people of Northern Jiangsu have decided to donate 23 aircraft, and the people of Western Sichuan have donated 20 aircraft. The people of Northern Sichuan have donated 27 aircraft, named the "New Northern Sichuan Fighter Squadron." The people of Nanchong City in that region donated 1.3 billion yuan in four hours on the afternoon of June 25th. The people of Eastern Sichuan donated 36 aircraft, the people of Southern Sichuan have donated 4 aircraft, and the people of Kangding, the capital of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Western Kang, donated a "Kangding" cannon. The people of Hainan Island donated 9 aircraft, and the people of Chairman Mao's hometown, Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, donated 5 aircraft named "Mao Zedong's Hometown." The donations from the people of Guangzhou have reached 35 billion yuan. Other regions have also enthusiastically donated many aircraft and cannons according to their actual situations. This fully demonstrates the enormous strength and magnificent spirit of the Chinese people. In order to ensure the realization of the donation plans, the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and the industrial and commercial circles of Beijing, Tianjin, Chongqing, Zhangjiakou, Baotou, Guihua, and other places, as well as the people of some places, have established Resist America, Aid Korea Increased Production and Donation Committees or Donation Committees to specifically lead and promote this work.
　　The donation plans of various regions and units generally focus on increasing production, increasing income, improving management, saving, and reducing waste. Each individual contributes a portion of their increased production or increased income to donate and purchase weapons. While formulating plans, they generally combine to revise the patriotic pledges of a unit, a workshop, a team, a rural area, or a household. This not only ensures the smooth development of the donation movement, but also promotes the development of the national economic construction. For example, after the Zhang Zhengrong team of a factory in Tianjin formulated a patriotic plan to increase production and donations, the output on June 5th exceeded the prescribed percentage by 51%. The donation movement is currently continuing to develop vigorously.

　　建立强大国防力量，保卫伟大祖国！
    各地初步献机千五百余架
    增产捐献运动继续发展，献机数目日增
    【本报讯】全国人民热烈响应抗美援朝总会号召，掀起了规模空前的爱国增加生产增加收入的捐献飞机大炮运动。截至六月二十九日为止，根据各地报纸材料的不完全统计，各地人民决定捐献和发起捐献的已有飞机一千五百六十八架、大炮一百门、高射炮三十三门和坦克七辆。（编者按：凡是捐献的数字不完全肯定的，按最低数字计算，如山东省抗美援朝分会号召捐献的“山东空军师”，是一百二十架到一百三十架，则以一百二十架计算。）
    这一规模巨大的捐献运动，表现了全国人民高度的爱国主义精神。自抗美援朝总会的号召发出后，各地抗美援朝分会及各工厂、矿山、农村、学校、机关、工商界、文化界等都相继召开会议，专门讨论如何响应和贯彻这一爱国号召。在这些会上，各地区各单位都根据各自的情况订出了增加生产增加收入的捐献计划，并马上开始行动。在全国范围内第一个号召展开爱国捐献运动的北京工商界，于六月十日正式决定捐献飞机二十七架（以后增献三架，共捐献三十架），在全国各地的工商界中起了带头示范的作用。紧接着武汉工商界于十三日决定捐献飞机三十架，天津工商界到十三日为止，已陆续决定捐献飞机三十架，沈阳工商界献飞机三十架，南京工商界捐飞机十架。各地各界人民大量捐献飞机的，据极不完全统计：东北各地人民已捐献二百零八架飞机；华北五省二市捐献飞机总数已达二百三十四架；湖南捐献战斗机一百架；山东省抗美援朝分会在六月十、十一日的扩大会上，决定号召全省人民捐献飞机一百二十架到一百三十架，组成“山东空军师”；江西省在二十日举行的各界人民抗美援朝代表会议上，也决定捐献飞机八十一架，定名为“八一空军师”；苏南人民决定捐献飞机一百二十架，命名为“苏南空军师”。此外，西北各族各界人民已捐献飞机四十架，皖北区各界捐二十五架，苏北各地人民已决定捐献二十三架，川西人民捐献飞机二十架，川北捐献飞机二十七架，命名为“新川北战斗机大队”。该区南充市人民六月二十五日下午四个小时即捐献十三亿元。川东人民捐献三十六架，川南人民已捐四架，西康省藏族自治区首府康定人民捐“康定号”大炮一门。海南岛人民捐献九架，毛主席故乡——湖南湘潭县人民捐献“毛泽东故乡号”飞机五架，广州人民的捐献则已达三百五十亿元。其他各地也都按实际情况热烈捐献了许多飞机和大炮等。这充分表现了中国人民巨大的力量和雄伟的气魄。为了保证捐献计划的实现，中国国民党革命委员会和北京、天津、重庆、张家口、包头、归绥等地的工商界以及某些地方的人民成立了抗美援朝增产捐献委员会或捐献委员会，专门领导和推动这一工作。
    各地区各单位的捐献计划，一般是以增加生产、增加收入、改善经营、节约、减少浪费等为主要内容，每一个人从自己增加生产或增加收入中提出一部分，捐献出来购买武器；在订计划的同时，一般都结合修订了一个单位、一个车间、一个小组、一个农村或一家一户的爱国公约。这不仅保证了捐献运动的顺利开展，同时又促进了国家经济建设事业的发展。如天津某工厂的张政荣小组，在制订爱国增产捐献计划以后，六月五日的产量已超过规定的百分之五十一。现捐献运动正继续蓬勃开展中。
