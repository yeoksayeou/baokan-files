How to Conduct Production Quota Setting Work in a County
	Li Shude

Regarding production quota setting work in a county, many places are still relatively unfamiliar with it. Now, the experiences of production quota setting in various parts of Henan are systematically explained, which may be helpful for production quota setting work in various regions.

I. Unified leadership by the county, with the participation of various districts, to organize joint assessment zones. The joint assessment zone is the junction between districts. Determine the scope of the joint assessment zone according to the actual situation; three or five townships are acceptable. Each district participating in the joint assessment zone must have at least one township, under the unified organization and leadership of the county. To facilitate leadership, a Production Quota Setting Joint Assessment Zone Committee should be established. The purpose is to balance the output between districts and establish land grade standards. The joint assessment zone should select areas with greater representativeness, as far as possible, to represent both plains and hills. However, it should not be completely limited to this. The number of joint assessment zones organized by a county should not be too many, as too many will disperse the county's strength, making them difficult to control, and may lead to spontaneity. The work steps are not easy to align, and the results are difficult to unify.

The task of the joint assessment zone is to move from "division into plots and grading" to "unified land grading and evaluation of the output difference between grades." The specific work process is as follows: A. Division into plots and grading; B. Comparison and merging of plots; C. Sampling and classification; D. Evaluation of unified grades, evaluation of output differences between grades.

II. With the district as the leader and the township as the participant, organize joint assessment townships. For example, if a district has ten townships, divide them into three or more joint assessment townships (divided according to the specific situation, not too large). Each township participating in the joint assessment township includes the entire area, not limited to the junction. The work of the joint assessment township is the same as that of the joint assessment zone, and the main purpose is to balance the output between townships. After the land grades of each joint assessment township are unified, they are ranked to the joint assessment zone to generate the land grades of the entire district.

There are two methods for unifying land grades: One method is for the county to evaluate the unified land grades of the entire county based on the materials from the joint assessment zones. The other method is to use a district as a unit, with the county directly controlling the production quota setting (without implementing unified land grades for the entire county), and using output to uniformly balance the output of the entire county, without seeking unified land grades. When setting production quotas, it is still concentrated in the county. Both of these methods have their advantages and disadvantages. The advantage of the former (unified land grading for the entire county) is that it unifies the output of each grade of land in the entire county, which can eliminate the concerns of imbalances in output between districts and facilitate statistics. The disadvantage is that if the county's strength is not sufficient, it is difficult to control; if districts do not understand the situation between each other, imbalances may occur. The advantage of the latter method (unified land grading by district) is that although the land grades are not unified, the set output can still be balanced, and it is easier for the county to control. The disadvantage is that it is difficult to statistically analyze; dividing into several joint assessment zones creates several land grade unit outputs, which increases the trouble of statistics. Although both methods have their advantages and disadvantages, the results of the production quota setting can be balanced, and experience has proven that both are successful. The first method is better; if the conditions are not met, the second method can be used. However, no matter which method is adopted, responsibility must be assigned at each level.

The specific methods of production quota setting are roughly divided into the following steps:

First step: Division into plots. For land types that are obvious, divide the plots and set the grades according to the type; for land types that are not obvious, divide the plots; for mountainous areas or areas with complex soil and topography, the plots should be smaller. Plot division should be based on the following conditions: (1) Land quality; (2) Natural land conditions (including sunlight, wind direction, water conservancy, etc.); (3) Elevation of the land; (4) General operating conditions and planting habits.

After mass discussion, organized surveys are carried out to divide areas with the same conditions as described above into one plot.

Second step: Comparison and merging of plots. Evaluate the plots through certain meeting formats, and merge the same plots into one grade. After merging the grades, publicly announce them to the masses to solicit opinions and make adjustments.

Third step: Sampling and classification. In order to further achieve fairness in land grades, extract individual good and bad plots within a plot and include them in the same grade. Or establish another grade, but the standard for sampling and classification must be based on the three conditions of natural land conditions, general operating conditions, and planting habits. Prevent those who work diligently and harvest more from being considered as particularly good land, and those who are lazy and harvest less from being considered as particularly bad land.

Fourth step: Unified evaluation of land grades. The district convenes a district-wide production quota setting meeting. After in-depth and repeated discussions, the good and bad land are arranged in order, which is the most important key to production quota setting work. The township must master the soil quality, topography, natural conditions, and other materials of various types and grades of land, and convene more forums with experienced local farmers to listen to their opinions.

Fifth step: Evaluation of the output difference between grades. This is to more meticulously evaluate land grades and lay the foundation for setting production quotas, and to identify the quality of land grades. Doing so can make those participating in the evaluation of output differences objective and calm, and proceed from reality.

Sixth step: The county drafts a production quota setting plan. The production quota setting should be based on the following materials, carefully analyzed and studied, and a plan drafted: A. Investigate and find out various materials investigated and understood during the production quota setting process. B. Materials obtained from forums with experienced farmers and labor models. C. Opinions discussed at the county production quota setting meeting. D. Historical materials from past burdens. Based on the above materials, analyze and study them, and draft a preliminary plan, which is submitted to the county production quota setting meeting for discussion, revision and approval, and a decision is made.

Then submit it to the county people's congress or farmers' representatives' meeting for revision and approval, and it becomes the county's final production quota setting resolution. The county's production quota setting must be democratic and proceed from reality. Coercive orders, assigning output, or letting things drift are all wrong.

Seventh step: Announce the plan to townships and make individual adjustments. After the production quota setting plan is decided, it should still be announced to the townships for mass discussion. If there are any discrepancies with the actual situation, they can be reported to the county people's government for appropriate adjustments.

Eighth step: Register by household. After the county people's government announces the production quota setting plan and after individual adjustments, it shall, on the basis of township, create a household land output register, which will serve as the basis for the agricultural tax register. The grade output should be carefully reviewed when registering households.

Ninth step: Report to the superior government for approval. After the household register is compiled, list and statistically analyze "population" by district, the number of mu of each grade of land, output, and the average output per mu of the entire county, and report it to the provincial people's government for approval. If the provincial people's government believes that the output set by the county is too high or too low, it will instruct the ratio to increase or decrease the output. For the sake of prudence, it is best for the county to report the production quota setting plan to the higher level before the county sets the output, and announce it to the townships after obtaining consent, so as to avoid trouble afterwards.

The scope (focus) of land survey and production quota setting should be placed in land reform areas, and should be organically combined with the central work. During the land reform period, only combine land surveys without setting production quotas, so as not to affect the central work. It can be combined with class division, anti-concealment, review, and issuance of land certificates.

In the southern provinces, the conditions should be distinguished, and general land measurement should generally not be carried out before the autumn harvest. After calling for self-reporting and focusing on spot checks, production quota setting should be carried out (general land measurement will be carried out when conditions permit); even in non-land reform areas, if rent reduction and anti-local tyrant campaigns have been carried out and the peasant masses have been basically mobilized, production quota setting can also be carried out first, and the output will be increased proportionally after black land is found in the future. In terms of specific practices, the government can verify the output based on the materials it has, or adopt a simple joint assessment method by joint districts and townships. When conditions mature in the future, conduct county-wide production quota setting work.

　　怎样进行一个县的定产工作
    李树德
    对于一个县的定产工作，到现在为止，各地还是比较生疏的，现将河南各地定产经验加以系统说明，对各地定产工作或有裨益。
    一、由县统一领导，由各区参加，组织联评区。联评区是各区之间的接合部。按实际情况，确定联评区的范围，三个乡或五个乡均可。参加联评区的每一个区至少要有一个乡，由县加以统一的组织和领导。为便于领导，应成立定产联评区委员会。目的在于平衡区与区之间的产量，树立地等标准。联评区要选择代表性较大的地区。尽可能做到既能代表平原，又能代表丘陵。但也不要完全局限于此。一个县所组织的联评区不宜过多，过多会分散县的力量，不好掌握，会形成自流，工作步骤不易一致，结果不好统一。
    联评区的任务是由“划片分等”到“统一地等，评出等与等之间的产量差额”。其具体工作经过为：甲、划片分等；乙、片比片并等；丙、抽块归等；丁、评出统一等级，评定等与等之间产量差额。
    二、以区为领导，由乡参加，组织联评乡。比如一个区有十个乡，划三个或三个以上联评乡（根据具体情况划分，不宜过大）。参加联评乡之每一个乡包括全部地区，不是限制在接合部。联评乡的工作和联评区同，主要目的在于平衡乡与乡之间的产量。各联评乡地等统一之后，即向联评区进行排等级，产生全区土地等级。
    统一地等有两种方法：一种方法是由县根据各联评区的材料，评出全县土地统一地等；另一种方法是以一个区为单位，由县掌握直接定产（不实行全县统一地等），用产量统一平衡全县产量，不求地等统一。定产时仍集中到县里来定。这两个办法都有其优缺点：前一种（全县土地统一评定等级）做法的优点是：统一了全县各等土地的产量，可以消除区与区之间怕产量不平衡的顾虑，同时便于统计。其缺点是：如县的力量不够充足，难以掌握；各区之间不了解情况时，可能发生不平衡现象。后一种（以区为单位统一评定土地等级）方法的优点是：地等虽不统一，但是所定产量也可达到平衡，而且县里掌握比较容易。缺点是：不好统计，划几个联评区就有几个地等的单位产量，增加了统计的麻烦。这两种办法虽均有其优点和缺点，但所定产量的结果都可达到平衡，经验证明都是成功的。二者以第一种办法比较好；如果条件不具备，可采用第二种办法。但无论采用那种办法，都必须逐级负责。
    定产的具体做法，大体上分以下几个步骤：
    第一步：划片。土地类别明显者，按类划片、定等；地类不明显者划片；山区或土质地形复杂者，片应划小。划片应根据以下几个条件：（１）土地质量；（２）土地自然条件（包括阳光，风向，水利等）；（３）地势的高低平凹；（４）一般经营条件及种植习惯。
    经过群众讨论，有组织地实施勘察，将上述这些条件相同者，划为一片。
    第二步：片比片并等。通过一定的会议形式进行评片，将相同的片，并为一个等。并等以后，再向群众口头公布，征求意见，进行调整。
    第三步：抽块归等。为进一步地求得地等公平，把片内个别好坏地块抽出，归入相同的等内。或另立一等，但抽块归等的标准一定要根据土地自然条件、一般经营条件、和种植习惯三个条件。防止因勤劳耕作多收成者作为特好地，因怠于耕作而收成少者作为特坏地。
    第四步：统一评定地等。由区召开全区定产会议，经过深入反复讨论之后，将好坏地依次排列起来，这是定产工作最主要的关键。乡必须掌握各类各等地的土质、地势、自然条件等材料，并多召集熟悉当地情况的老农座谈，听取他们的意见。
    第五步：评定等与等的产量差额。这是为了更细致的评定地等，打下定产量的基础，鉴别地等的好坏程度。这样做，可使参加评定产量差额的人客观冷静，从实际出发。
    第六步：县拟订定产方案。定产应根据以下几种材料，慎重分析研究，拟订方案：甲、查出定产过程中所调查了解的各种材料。乙、召开老农、劳动模范座谈会所获得的材料。丙、县定产会议所讨论的意见。丁、过去负担中的历史材料。根据以上各种材料，加以研究分析，拟出初步方案，交县定产大会讨论修正通过，作出决定。
    然后交县人民代表会或农民代表会修正通过，成为全县最后定产决议。全县定产，必须做到民主和从实际出发。强迫命令、派产量或放任自流都是错误的。
    第七步：分乡公布，个别调整。定产方案决定后，仍应分乡公布，让群众讨论。如有与实际情况不符者，可层报县人民政府，酌情进行调整。
    第八步：归户造册。县人民政府公布定产方案，经过个别调整后，即以乡为单位造具分户土地产量清册，作为农业税清册的基础。入户时要慎重审查其等级产量。
    第九步：报请上级政府核准。分户清册编好后，以区为单位列表统计“人口”，各等地的亩数，产量及全县每亩平均产量，报请省人民政府批准。省人民政府如认为该县所定产量有过高或过低者，即指示比例增减产量。为慎重起见，最好在县未订定产量前，县先向上级报告定产方案，得同意后再分乡公布，以免事后麻烦。
    查田定产的范围（重点）应放在土地改革区，并要与中心工作有机结合起来进行。在土地改革期间，只结合查田不定产，以免影响中心工作。可以在划阶级、反隐瞒、复查、颁发土地证时结合进行。
    在江南各省应区别条件，在秋收以前一般不进行普遍丈量土地。在号召自报，重点抽查后，就进行定产（待条件许可时再进行普遍丈量土地）；就是未土地改革区，已经过减租反恶霸，农民群众已有基本发动的，也可先进行定产，将来查出黑田再比例增加产量。具体作法上，可由政府根据掌握的材料进行核定产量，或采取联区，联乡简单评定的办法。将来条件成熟时再进行全县的定产工作。
