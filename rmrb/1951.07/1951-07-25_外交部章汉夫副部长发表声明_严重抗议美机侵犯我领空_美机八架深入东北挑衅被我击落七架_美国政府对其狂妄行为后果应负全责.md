　　Xinhua News Agency, July 24th—Zhang Hanfu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, issued the following statement regarding the intrusion of U.S. military aircraft invading Korea into our Northeast airspace:
　　At 8:29 AM on July 21, 1951, eight U.S. F94 jet fighters intruded into our Northeast airspace, flying from Kuandian first towards Shenyang and then turning towards Liaoyang and Fengcheng. Our Air Force resolutely rose to defend our motherland's inviolable airspace, shooting down seven intruding U.S. aircraft, with the other one escaping.
　　The July 21st incident is a serious provocation. The fact that this occurred during the Korean armistice negotiations is particularly noteworthy.
　　The July 21st provocation by the U.S. Air Force is a new development in a series of provocative acts by the U.S. Air Force invading Korea, which have continuously violated the airspace of the People's Republic of China since August 27, 1950. It should be pointed out that the U.S. Air Force invading Korea has not stopped these provocations even during the recent Korean armistice negotiations. From July 11th to 16th, U.S. aircraft repeatedly intruded into the airspace over Ji'an, Andong, Kuandian, Huanren, and other places in our Northeast. At 21:00 on July 15th, U.S. aircraft intruding over Gaijialing Village in Andong even dropped three bombs. On July 17th, U.S. aircraft intruded into the airspace over Ji'an, Andong, Kuandian, and other places in our Northeast five times. On the 18th, they intruded into the airspace over Ji'an, Andong, and other places three times. The July 21st provocation by the U.S. Air Force is the most brazen of all these provocations. The U.S. Air Force has previously used the excuse of the difficulty of distinguishing borders in the air to justify its actions, but this time, the U.S. Air Force has so deeply intruded into our airspace that it will be impossible to find any excuse.
　　The Central People's Government expresses its serious protest against the continued and expanded atrocities of the U.S. Air Force invading Korea in violating our airspace. The U.S. Government must bear full responsibility for the consequences caused by this arrogant and provocative behavior of its air force.

　　外交部章汉夫副部长发表声明
　  严重抗议美机侵犯我领空
　  美机八架深入东北挑衅被我击落七架
　  美国政府对其狂妄行为后果应负全责
    【新华社二十四日讯】中央人民政府外交部副部长章汉夫对于美国侵略朝鲜的军用飞机深入地侵入我国东北领空一事，发表声明如下：
    一九五一年七月二十一日上午八时二十九分，美国Ｆ９４式喷气战斗机八架侵入我国东北领空，经宽甸先向沈阳后又折向辽阳、凤城方向飞进。我空军当奋起保卫我祖国不可侵犯的领空，击落了侵入的美机七架，其另一架逃去。
    七月二十一日的事件是一个严重的挑衅事件。这事发生在朝鲜停战谈判期间，尤足令人注意。
    七月二十一日美国空军的挑衅事件，是美国侵朝空军从一九五○年八月二十七日以来一连串侵犯中华人民共和国领空的挑衅行为的新发展。应当指出：美国侵朝空军在最近朝鲜停战谈判期间也没有停止这种挑衅。在七月十一日至十六日，美国飞机曾多次侵入我东北之辑安、安东、宽甸、桓仁等地上空，在七月十五日二十一时，侵入安东盖家堎村上空的美国飞机竟投弹三枚。在七月十七日，美机侵入我东北之辑安、安东、宽甸等地上空五次。在十八日侵入辑安、安东等地上空三次。七月二十一日美国空军的挑衅，则是所有这些挑衅中最放肆的一次。美国空军过去曾经利用在空中不易辨别边界为其诡辩的借口，但在这一次，美国空军如此深入地侵犯我国领空，将无法寻找任何借口。
    中央人民政府对美国侵朝空军继续并扩大侵犯我国领空的暴行，表示严重的抗议。美国政府对其空军的这种狂妄的挑衅行为所引起的后果，必须负起全部责任。
