Many Wastes Can Be Avoided with Serious Responsibility to the People—Opinions on Comrade Chen Yougong

In this short period of just over two years, the achievements in construction in various fields across the country have been truly astonishing. Everyone knows this, and everyone cheers and rejoices. The same is true in basic construction. The newspaper pointing out biases in the work is precisely to improve the work, reduce waste, and consolidate achievements. We believe that all revolutionary work is inherently a process of continuously overcoming difficulties and eliminating obstacles.

Comrade Chen Yougong's argument—that he does not believe there are some serious problems in the current basic construction, and emphasizes that these problems have objective reasons—we feel that this is inappropriate. It is entirely correct, necessary, and timely for the People's Daily to point out some serious tendencies in basic construction as we are about to embark on larger-scale economic construction. This is neither sitting in a room and talking empty words, nor is it negating achievements. Rather, there is indeed a lot of waste in engineering construction that can be avoided if the leadership maintains a firm grip and the staff take a serious, conscientious, and cautious attitude beforehand, preventing unnecessary losses and waste. Take our Construction Bureau, for example. We believe that there are also significant shortcomings in road construction projects. Due to the purely task-oriented viewpoint and the rush-to-complete mentality of some comrades in our bureau, in the past, road construction only focused on quantity, not quality; some roads were damaged as soon as they were built. In order to rush the project, oiled roads were still being built in the freezing cold of November, and crushed stone roads were being built in the winter, despite workers' objections. As a result, remedial measures had to be taken again this year. In the design department, some projects were not thoroughly investigated and studied beforehand. For example, in the past, the Yi-Xiang convenience line project designed the roadbed on a drainage ditch. As a result, stone materials were delivered, but it was found to be impossible, and the line had to be re-routed. This not only created economic waste, but also brought about adverse political effects. These problems are completely avoidable. There are also many comrades here who have the same way of thinking as Comrade Chen Yougong, attributing many problems to "the budget being approved too late," "lack of cadres," "increased material freight," and "tight deadlines." Of course, these problems have affected our work. However, the question is whether we can exert our subjective strength in these existing facts to promote the work. For example, there is a shortage of cadres everywhere in the country. The question is how to better leverage the role of cadres in the current cadre situation. Obviously, not all difficulties can be attributed to "lack of cadres." Can we say that incorrect earthwork estimates, inappropriate alignment, or unsuitable road construction seasons are due to a lack of cadres? If we think this way, we are likely to overlook our own subjective shortcomings, neglecting considerations of cadre work, personnel organization and allocation, and leadership style. This would also eliminate the possibility of improving the work, and it would be impossible to take the initiative. Work can only be improved through subjective efforts, and we must grasp difficulties with planning and foresight, creating conditions to avoid mistakes.

We feel that Comrade Chen Yougong's view is probably shared by many cadres. That is to say, regarding the discussion that "construction is impossible without a correct design," many comrades still have not fully understood some basic ideas, which hinders us from exposing problems in basic construction projects and hinders the improvement of work. We hope that everyone will engage in criticism and self-criticism in this regard.

### 只要对人民严肃负责许多浪费都可以避免——对陈有功同志的意见

    只要对人民严肃负责许多浪费都可以避免——对陈有功同志的意见
    在这短短的二年多时间中，在全国范围内，各方面的建设成绩是非常惊人的。谁都知道，谁都欢呼、高兴。基本建设方面也是如此。报纸上指出工作中的偏向，正是为了改进工作，减少浪费，巩固成绩。我们觉得：一切革命工作，本身就是不断克服困难，排除障碍的过程。
    陈有功同志的论点：不认为在目前基本建设中存在着一些严重的毛病，而且强调这些毛病有他客观上的原因，我们觉得这样说是不恰当的。人民日报在我们即将展开更大规模经济建设的时候，提出基本建设中的一些严重倾向，是完全正确的、必要的、及时的，既不是坐在屋子里说空话，也不是抹杀成绩。而是有很多工程建设上的浪费，的确只要领导上掌握得紧，和工作人员事先采取严肃、认真、谨慎的态度，不必要的损失浪费是可以避免的。就拿我们建设局来说，我们认为在筑路工程上也存在很大的缺点，由于我局一部分同志在思想上有单纯任务观点，赶工思想，过去修路只贪多，不重质；有的路修了就坏。为了赶工，十一月大冷的天还在做泼油路，冬天还做石碴路，工人提意见也不听。结果，不得不在今年重新补救处理。在设计部门，有些工程事先调查研究也不周到。如过去颐香便线工程，把路基设计在水沟上，结果石料也运到了，发现不行，又重新改线。这样不但形成经济上的浪费，同时也带来了不良的政治影响。这些毛病，是完全可以避免的。我们这里也有不少同志，正和陈有功同志有同样的思想方法，很多问题都归结到“预算批得太晚”、“干部缺”、“材料运费涨了”、“任务紧”。当然，这些问题是使我们工作受到了影响。可是，问题就在于我们是不是在这些既存在的事实中，发挥我们主观上的力量，使工作推进。譬如，干部缺，全国到处都这样。问题就在于在现有的干部情况中，如何更好的发挥干部的作用。很显然的，不是一切困难可以归结于“干部缺”。我们难道能说，土方没有估算正确、定线定得不恰当、修路季节不合，能是干部缺的原故吗？如果我们这样想的话，就很可能忽视自己主观上的毛病，忽视对于干部工作、人力组织配备、领导作风等问题的考虑。也就失掉了改进工作的可能，工作也不可能争取到主动。工作只有主观上努力才有可能改进，困难也须要我们有计划、有预见地来掌握它，创造避免错误的条件。
    我们觉得陈有功同志这样的看法，在干部中恐怕还不少。那就是说，对于“没有正确的设计，就不可能施工”这一讨论，很多同志中还有一些基本思想没有搞通，因而也就妨碍我们对基本建设工程中毛病的揭发，妨碍工作的改进。我们希望在这一方面大家展开批评和自我批评。
