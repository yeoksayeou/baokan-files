Henan University Faculty and Staff Implement Patriotic Pledges, Promoting Work

The faculty and staff of Henan University, by implementing patriotic pledges, have promoted work and study.

The patriotic pledges of Henan University were established under the unified leadership of the university's Patriotic Construction Movement Promotion Committee, after a long period of patriotic ideological education among the entire faculty, staff, and students. After the establishment of the university-wide patriotic pledge, each college, department, class, as well as administrative group, teaching and research group, labor union group, and study group, formulated patriotic pledges level by level based on the principles of the university-wide patriotic pledge and in light of the specific tasks of their respective units. At the same time, more than 90 percent of the people in the university also formulated personal patriotic plans. The establishment of these patriotic pledges and patriotic plans was preceded by thorough deliberation and discussion, focusing on determining ways to complete work tasks and correct shortcomings within a certain period and under certain conditions. After the draft of the patriotic pledge or patriotic plan was drawn up, the opinions of relevant units were solicited, repeatedly studied, and then revised to ensure that it was specific and practical.

In order to ensure that the patriotic pledges could be effectively implemented, each unit formulated an implementation plan for the patriotic pledges. Units or individuals with similar business characteristics also launched competitions based on the main contents of their own patriotic pledges or patriotic plans. At the same time, the university's Patriotic Construction Movement Promotion Committee and each college and department established inspection teams. Each group has an inspector, and each group spends about ten minutes each day checking the implementation of the patriotic pledge by each group member on that day. The entire department is inspected once a week, the entire college is summarized once a month, and the university inspection team conducts spot checks at any time. Each unit regards the implementation of the patriotic pledge as the main content of the life criticism meeting. Recently, students have been filling out bi-weekly reports on the implementation of the patriotic pledge every two weeks and filling out personal patriotic work competition log sheets every day, making the inspection of the implementation of the patriotic pledge a regular job and gradually deepening it.

As a result of the diligent implementation of the patriotic pledge by the faculty and staff of Henan University, the university has taken on a new look. Personnel in all departments have set out weekly work schedules, the planning of work has been greatly strengthened, and work efficiency has therefore been significantly improved.

　　河南大学师生员工执行爱国公约推动了工作
    河南大学师生员工执行爱国公约，推动了工作与学习。
    河南大学的爱国公约是在该校爱国建校运动推进委员会的统一领导下在全校师生员工经过了长期的爱国主义思想教育的基础上订立的。在全校性的爱国公约订立后，各院、系、班以及行政小组、教学研究组、工会小组和学习小组，都根据全校爱国公约的原则，结合本单位的具体任务，逐级订立了爱国公约。同时，全校有百分之九十以上的人还订立了个人的爱国计划。这些爱国公约和爱国计划的订立，事前都经过了充分的酝酿与讨论，着重确定在一定时间内和在一定的条件下，完成工作任务与改正缺点的办法。他们在爱国公约或爱国计划的草案订出后，并征询有关单位的意见，反复研究，然后加以修正，务求订得具体而切合实际。
    为了保证爱国公约能够切实执行，各单位都订立了爱国公约的实施计划。业务性质相近的单位或个人之间，并以自己的爱国公约或爱国计划的主要内容为条件，展开竞赛。同时，该校爱国建校运动推进委员会及各院、系都成立了检查组。每个小组都设有检查员，各组每天以十分钟左右的时间检查当天各个组员执行爱国公约的情形。全系每周检查一次，全院每月总结一次，全校检查组则随时抽查。各单位都把执行爱国公约的情形作为生活检讨会的主要内容。最近学生们每两周填写一次爱国公约执行情况的双周报告表，每日填写个人爱国主义工作竞赛日志表，使检查爱国公约的执行情形成为经常工作，并得以逐步深入。
    河南大学师生员工认真执行爱国公约的结果，使该校面目一新。各部门的人员都按周订出工作日程，工作的计划性大为加强，工作效率因而显著地提高。
