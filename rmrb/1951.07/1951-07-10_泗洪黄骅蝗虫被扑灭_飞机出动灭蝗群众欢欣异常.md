　　The locust plague in Sihong and Huanghua eradicated.
    Airplanes Deployed, People Rejoice.
    Xinhua News Agency: The two airplanes dispatched by the Central People's Government to Sihong County, Northern Anhui, to assist farmers in eradicating locusts have successfully completed their mission. Since June 18th, the two airplanes have been continuously deployed to spray "666" insecticide powder in the dense grass and reed areas where manual capture was difficult, during the early morning and evening hours when there was dew. From the 18th to the 23rd, except for one day of intermittent work due to heavy fog, a total of 101 spraying sorties were conducted over five days, with 40 hours and 55 minutes of work, spraying an area of over 9,500 mu and using 10,000 kilograms of pesticide. Inspection six hours after the spraying of the pesticide powder showed that the mortality and poisoning rate of flying locusts and 4th and 5th instar nymphs accounted for more than 70%.

    The people of Sihong County, who have suffered from the Huai River floods for years, saw the great project of harnessing the Huai River being undertaken by the People's Government last winter. Now, when their crops are severely threatened by locusts, the Central People's Government has sent airplanes to assist them in eradicating the locusts. Therefore, they spread the news and rejoiced immensely. The 70,000 farmers distributed in the wasteland along the lake to eradicate locusts took even more rapid and thorough action to thank Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government for their concern. On the morning of the 18th, the two airplanes eliminated locusts in a dense area of more than 2,000 mu in Pianzitai, Xuefeng District, which greatly boosted the morale of the masses. More than 7,000 farmers eradicating locusts in that area braved the rain to fight the locusts that day, some even catching them with torches at night. Within four days, they completely eliminated the locusts within 40,000 mu around the dense area. Through the efforts of the masses and the assistance of airplanes, the locusts distributed throughout the county, covering more than 300,000 mu, were basically eradicated by the 23rd.

    When the two locust eradication airplanes left Su County, they were warmly seen off by the Northern Anhui Administrative Office, the Su County Commissioner's Office, and various agencies and organizations in Su County. The People's Air Force also received four silk banners from the East China Department of Agriculture and Forestry and other units.

    The locust nymphs in Huanghua County, Hebei Province, have been successfully eradicated by the local People's Government leading the masses in the fight, and with the assistance of airplanes sent by the Central People's Government by late June.

    Huanghua County is located near the Bohai Sea, with low terrain and extremely high alkali content in the soil. Cultivated land accounts for only 25% of the county, with the rest being reeds and wasteland. Therefore, the county has always been a breeding ground for locust nymphs.

    The locust nymph infestation in Huanghua County this year was the most serious in more than 60 years. In mid-May, when locust nymphs were first discovered in the county, there were only a few hundred mu. This quickly expanded to several thousand mu, and then to 230,000 mu. If the locust nymphs in the county were not completely eradicated before they became flying locusts, the people of Huanghua, and even many areas in Hebei, would suffer serious harm.

    After learning about the locust situation in Huanghua County, the Central People's Government immediately allocated a large number of equipment and medicines for eradicating locust nymphs to the county. A total of 250,000 kilograms of "666" insecticide powder and more than 1,200 sprayers were transported there (a small part of the medicines and equipment were transported by the Hebei Provincial People's Government and the Cang County Commissioner's Office). The Central People's Government also sent four airplanes on June 13th to assist in the eradication. Yang Xiandong, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, Li Shijun, Director of the Pest and Disease Control Department, Zhang Kerang, Deputy Director of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, Wang Luming, Commissioner of the Cang County Commissioner's Office, and others also rushed to organize the masses to fight the locusts. At the same time, the county established a locust eradication command headquarters, and each district established a locust eradication brigade headquarters to lead the masses in vigorously catching locust nymphs. More than 15,000 people participated in this locust nymph catching team.

    The cadres and masses of the county were extremely moved by the concern and assistance of the People's Government, and their enthusiasm for locust eradication was extremely high. They worked tirelessly day and night, using various methods to fight the locusts, such as digging head-on ditches to lure and kill them, digging ditches or setting fires to encircle and kill them, and spraying insecticide powder. The locust nymph area was quickly reduced. Airplane spraying played an even better role. Although the use of airplanes to kill insects was the first time in China, the work efficiency was rapidly improved due to the constant research by the pilots and cadres, and the on-site guidance of Soviet experts, with each airplane increasing from spraying 700 to 800 mu per day to more than 3,100 mu.

    Through the efforts of the masses and the assistance of airplanes, the 230,000 mu of locust nymphs in the county were basically eliminated by June 26th.

　　泗洪黄骅蝗虫被扑灭
    飞机出动灭蝗群众欢欣异常
    中央人民政府派往皖北泗洪县协助农民灭蝗的两架飞机，已胜利完成任务。两架飞机自上月十八日起，即在飞蝗密集、人工难以捕打的深草苇地带，在每日早晚有露水时连续出动喷射“六六六”杀虫粉。自十八日至二十三日，除因有浓雾间歇一天外，五日内共喷射一百零一次，工作四十小时五十五分，喷射面积达九千五百余亩，用药一万公斤。在喷射药粉六小时后检查，飞蝗与四、五龄跳蝗的死亡与中毒率即占百分之七十以上。
    历受淮河水灾的泗洪县人民，去年冬天看到人民政府开始进行根治淮河的伟大工程，现在当他们的庄稼受到蝗虫的严重威胁时，中央人民政府又派来飞机协助他们灭治蝗虫，因此纷纷奔走相告，欢欣若狂。分布于沿湖荒草地带扑灭蝗虫的七万农民，即以更打得快、打得净的实际行动，来感谢毛主席和中央人民政府的关怀。十八日晨，两架飞机在雪枫区骈台子消灭了二千多亩密集地带的蝗虫后，更大大鼓舞了群众的灭蝗情绪，在该处灭蝗的七千多农民，当日冒着暴雨扑打，有的夜晚打着火把捕捉，四天内即将密集地带周围四万亩内的蝗虫全部肃清。经过群众努力捕打和飞机协助扑杀，分布全县达三十余万亩的蝗虫，至二十三日即已基本被扑灭。
    当两架灭蝗飞机在离开宿县前，曾受到皖北行署、宿县专署及宿县城各机关团体的热烈欢送。人民空军并收到华东农林部等处送来的锦旗四面。

    河北省黄骅县的蝗蝻，经当地人民政府领导群众扑打，并经中央人民政府派飞机协助扑杀后，至六月下旬即已胜利扑灭。
    黄骅县临渤海，地势低下，土地含碱分极多，全县耕地只占百分之二十五，其余全为芦苇、荒草地，因而该县向为蝗蝻发源地。
    今年黄骅县发生的蝗蝻，为六十余年来最严重的一次。五月中旬该县开始发现蝗蝻时仅有数百亩，紧接着发展到数千亩，后竟发展到二十三万亩。该县蝗蝻如不在成为飞蝗前彻底扑灭，黄骅人民甚至河北等好多地区将受其严重祸害。
    中央人民政府得悉黄骅县的蝗情后，立即拨付该县大批扑灭蝗蝻的器材和药品，先后运去的有“六六六”杀虫粉二十五万斤，喷粉器一千二百多架（内有一小部药械是河北省人民政府及沧县专署运去的）。中央人民政府并于六月十三日派飞机四架前往协助剿灭。中央人民政府农业部副部长杨显东、病虫害防治司司长李世俊、河北省人民政府农林厅副厅长张克让、沧县专署专员王路明等，均先后带领干部及专家赶往组织群众扑打。同时，该县又成立了灭蝗指挥部，各区设立灭蝗大队部，领导群众大力捕捉蝗蝻。参加此次捕蝻队伍的有一万五千多人。
    该县干部和群众对人民政府如此的关怀和帮助，极为感动，因而扑蝗情绪极为高涨。每天日夜紧张地采用各种办法扑打，如挖迎头沟诱杀，挖沟或放火围杀，喷粉器撒药等，将蝗蝻区迅速缩小。飞机撒粉更起了良好的作用。使用飞机杀虫在我国虽是第一次，但因驾驶人员和干部时刻钻研，又得苏联专家实地指导，因此工作效率迅速提高，每架飞机每日由撒粉七、八百亩，提高到三千一百余亩。
    经过群众捕打和飞机的协助扑杀，该县二十三万亩的蝗蝻，至六月二十六日，即大体消灭。
