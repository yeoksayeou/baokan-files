Since the beginning of this month, rainfall has been widespread in the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, causing the water levels of the Yangtze and its tributaries to rise sharply in recent days. In the Leshan area of the Min River basin, a tributary of the upper Yangtze, a total of 114.1 millimeters of rain fell from the 8th to the 15th. The water level at the Yibin station on the Min River rose sharply by 7.44 meters on the 9th and 10th. At the same time, the Jialing River, Tuo River, Fu River, and Qian River and other tributaries also generally swelled. The water level at the Chongqing station on the Yangtze River rose sharply by 12.04 meters in the two days of the 10th and 11th, and the water levels on the 11th and 12th were both 183.27 meters, exceeding the highest water level during last year's flood season by 2.22 meters. On the 12th, the flood peak reached Wanxian, where the water level on that day was 125.7 meters, rising sharply to 129.85 meters by the 13th, 11.98 meters higher than on the 11th. On the 14th, the water level at the Chongqing station on the Yangtze River began to fall, and the flood flowed downstream. On that day, the water level at Yichang reached 52.72 meters, and the water level at Shashi reached 43.27 meters, both exceeding the local danger levels. On the 19th, the water level at Hankou also rose to 23.46 meters, an increase of 0.37 meters compared to the 18th. The Hubei Provincial Flood Control Headquarters and the local flood control agencies along the Jingjiang Dike have mobilized a large number of people to go to the dikes, guarding them day and night.

On the downstream side of the Yangtze River, although the flood peak has not yet arrived, the base water level in the main channel of the Yangtze River is relatively low. However, due to continuous rainfall in the past half month, mountain torrents have erupted in various places, and inland rivers have surged, causing river dikes to breach and flooding to occur in some areas. According to a survey of counties along the Yangtze River in southern Anhui alone, the total rainfall in the area from the 11th to the 17th of this month was more than twice the average total rainfall in July for the area in the past 50 years. In Qingyang and Langxi counties in southern Anhui alone, more than 57,000 mu of farmland have been flooded due to waterlogging. At present, the East China Flood Control Headquarters and local flood control headquarters have issued emergency instructions, calling on government cadres at all levels to vigorously lead the masses in preventing waterlogging and floods, and to fight against the floods.

　　长江水势普遍上涨
　  防汛机关紧急动员固守堤防
    本月上旬以来，长江上中下游各地普遍下雨，因此长江及其支流的水势连日急遽上涨。长江上游的支流岷江流域的乐山一带，在八日至十五日共降雨一一四点一公厘，九、十两日岷江宜宾站水位急涨七点四四公尺。同时，嘉陵江、沱江、涪江、黔江等支流也普遍涨水。长江重庆站水位在十、十一两日内猛涨十二点零四公尺，十一、十二两日的水位均为一八三点二七公尺，超过去年汛期内的最高水位二点二二公尺。十二日，洪水峰到达万县，万县当日的水位为一二五点七公尺，至十三日急涨至一二九点八五公尺，较十一日高出十一点九八公尺。十四日，长江重庆站的水位开始下降，洪水下泄，当日宜昌的水位达五二点七二公尺，在沙市的水位达四三点二七公尺，均超过当地的危险水位。十九日，汉口水位亦涨达二三点四六公尺，较十八日涨零点三七公尺。湖北省防汛指挥部及沿荆江大堤的各地防汛机关均已动员大批人工上堤，昼夜防守堤防。
    长江下游方面，目前洪水峰虽然尚未到达，长江干河河漕的底水较低，但因近半月来连续降雨，各地山洪暴发，内河猛涨，以致部分地区发生河堤漫决和内涝。仅据皖南沿长江各县的调查，该地区从本月十一日到十七日一周内的总降雨量，已达该地区五十年来七月份平均总雨量的两倍以上。仅皖南青阳、郎溪等县因内涝被淹的农田即达五万七千多亩。现在，华东防汛总指挥部及各地防汛指挥部均已发出紧急指示，号召各级人民政府工作干部大力领导群众防涝、防汛，与洪水作斗争。
