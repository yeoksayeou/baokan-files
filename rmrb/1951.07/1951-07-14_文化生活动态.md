*   "Hubei Peasant" Newspaper Inaugurated on "July 1st"
    The "Hubei Peasant" newspaper was inaugurated on July 1st of this year. It is a four-page, four-folio publication issued every three days. Comrade Li Xiannian, Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, published a paper entitled "Using the Idea of Worker-Peasant Alliance to Guide Rural Work" in the inaugural issue of the newspaper, pointing out that: First, this newspaper must be easy to understand, targeting the reading level of cadres below the township level and the broad masses of peasants. It should be understandable to peasants who know more than a thousand characters, and understandable even to illiterate peasants. Second, it must vividly reflect the lives and struggles of the peasants, basically achieving "peasants writing about peasants," and meeting the requirements and interests of the broad masses of peasants. Third, all departments' work, under the principle of serving the people, should currently first face the countryside and serve the broad masses of peasants. Use the correct idea of the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class to guide the peasants forward, giving the broad masses of peasants and cadres a clear understanding of the future. Fourth, it should also use a certain amount of space to report on the lives and struggles of workers, so that peasants can specifically learn from workers, accept the leadership of the working class, and move forward hand in hand.

*   Northwest Radio Network Gradually Established
    The Northwest Radio Network has been gradually established. Since November of last year, the region has established radio stations in twenty-four special districts, one hundred and ninety-eight counties (cities), and the Alxa and Ejin Banner autonomous regions; trained three hundred and fifteen announcers (including those from government agencies and troops); and organized mass listening groups in some areas.
    Because the Northwest region is vast, transportation is inconvenient, and it is relatively difficult to disseminate current events and convey policies and decrees. Therefore, the radio network has become an important organization for the masses to learn about current events and policies and decrees. Radio stations in various places regularly provide local blackboard newspapers and mimeographed newspapers with news materials, so that the people can keep abreast of major domestic and international events in a timely manner; therefore, blackboard newspapers and mimeographed newspapers in various places have also developed rapidly. Since the establishment of a radio station in Baihe County, Shaanxi Province, the number of blackboard newspapers in the county has increased from forty to one hundred and twenty-eight. In remote areas such as Yushu County, Qinghai Province, it used to take more than a month to see a newspaper, but now they can see newly发生的 current events news on the blackboard newspapers run by the radio station. Radio stations in fifty-six counties in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, jointly run mimeographed newspapers with local propaganda agencies. In places where listening groups have been established, various forms of oral broadcasting, such as rooftop broadcasting and mobile broadcasting, have also been organized.
    In the movements to Resist America and Aid Korea and to Suppress Counter-Revolutionaries, all provinces have made full use of radio stations to organize the masses to listen to broadcasts, which has played a significant role in promoting the movements. In Xi'an, Dihua, Lanzhou, and other places, more than 500,000 people listened to the broadcast of the public trial meeting for suppressing counter-revolutionaries. During the broadcast meeting in Xi'an to welcome the First Branch of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea for Consolation, the audience initiated donations of airplanes and cannons, and they donated more than 99 million yuan in Renminbi within three hours.

  《湖北农民》报“七一”创刊

  西北广播收音网已逐步建立
    西北区广播收音网已逐步建立。该区自去年十一月以来，在二十四个专区，一百九十八个县（市）和阿拉善、额济纳两个旗自治区建立了广播收音站；训练了三百一十五名收音员（包括机关、部队）；部分地区并组织了群众收听小组。
    西北因地区辽阔，交通不便，宣传时事和传达政策法令都比较困难。因此，广播收音网就成为群众学习时事和政策法令的重要组织。各地收音站经常供给当地黑板报和油印报以新闻资料，使人民群众能及时地了解国内外大事；因此，各地黑板报和油印报也有了迅速的发展。陕西省白河县自建立收音站后，全县黑板报自四十块增加到一百二十八块。青海省玉树县等偏远地区过去要一个多月才能看到报纸，现在能从收音站办的黑板报上看到新发生的时事新闻。陕西、甘肃两省现有五十六个县的收音站，收音站并和当地宣传机构合办油印报纸。建立收听小组的地方，还组织了屋顶广播、巡回广播等各种形式的口头广播。
    在抗美援朝和镇压反革命运动中，各省都充分利用收音站，组织群众收听广播，对运动起了不小的推动作用。西安、迪化、兰州等地先后收听镇压反革命公审大会广播的群众达五十万人以上。西安市举行欢迎中国人民赴朝慰问团第一分团广播大会时，听众发起捐献飞机大炮，他们三小时内就捐出了人民币九千九百余万元。（新华社）
