　　Xinhua News Agency, July 7th—The National Performing Arts Troupe Work Conference, convened by the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, concluded on June 29th after twelve days of plenary sessions and group discussions.

　　The conference made a preliminary summary of the achievements and experiences of the national performing arts troupes. According to statistics from the conference, there are currently 305 performing arts troupes nationwide, with nearly 20,000 members (military performing arts troupes far exceed this number and were not included in the statistics). Performing arts troupes, in coordination with the political tasks of each period, have conducted extensive propaganda among the masses through various new art forms. Over the past decade, they have created many excellent plays and lyrics, and created and promoted new operas and mass dances. The conference fully appreciated the role of the performing arts troupes.

　　The conference defined the future direction, tasks, and division of labor of the performing arts troupes based on the new situation. The conference determined that the general task of the performing arts troupes is to vigorously develop the people's new opera, new drama, new music, and new dance, and to educate the broad masses of the people with revolutionary spirit and patriotic spirit. The work of the performing arts troupes should be divided and cooperate with the work of opera reform: on the one hand, reform old opera, and on the other hand, develop new drama, new music, and new dance, complementing each other and moving towards the overall goal of building a new national art.

　　Regarding the division of labor of the national performing arts troupes, the conference stipulated: central, greater administrative regions, and large cities with conditions should establish theaters or specialized troupes, focusing on theater performances, and gradually building theater art; provinces and medium-sized cities should establish troupes or comprehensive performing arts troupes that mainly perform dramas, with both theater performances (in provincial capitals) and touring performances (in affiliated cities and rural areas); special districts should establish comprehensive performing arts teams that mainly perform dramas or sing, mainly touring in towns and rural areas, as needed and possible. Generally speaking, the national performing arts troupes should still focus on serving the vast rural areas and towns, with touring performances as the mainstay; popularization work is the primary task of the performing arts troupes. All kinds of performing arts troupes must, within a certain range, guide the amateur drama and other art activities of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and establish fixed and regular guidance relationships with mass amateur art organizations.

　　In order to improve the creation and performance level of the performing arts troupes, the conference believes that performing arts troupes across the country must establish working systems and learning systems; take two to three months each year to conduct annual summaries and rectifications. The conference particularly emphasized the importance of creation. Major administrative regions and provinces and cities with conditions should concentrate a certain amount of creative power and organize creation in a planned manner according to the political tasks of each period. During the conference, responsible comrades of the Art Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Culture exchanged views with the heads of the delegations of the major administrative regions and initially assigned the creative tasks for the second half of this year to the performing arts troupes of the major administrative regions.

　　The conference listened to and discussed the report of Minister of Culture Shen Yanbing on the direction, tasks, and division of labor of the performing arts troupes. In order to exchange work experience from all aspects, representatives from Northeast, Northwest, East China, Central South, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Hebei, Shanghai, Beijing, and the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delivered typical speeches; Lao She, Tian Han, Li Bozhao, Song Zhi's, Zhang Geng, Lü Ji, Jiao Juyin, Wu Xiaobang and others made thematic speeches on creation and business learning of the performing arts troupes. Finally, Deputy Minister Zhou Yang made a summary of the conference. All the representatives reached a consensus on the future direction, tasks, and division of labor of the performing arts troupes. After listening to various thematic speeches and typical speeches, they felt that they had learned a lot.

　　全国文工团工作会议闭幕
    【新华社七日讯】中央人民政府文化部召开的全国文工团工作会议，经过十二天的大会和小组讨论，已于六月二十九日闭幕。
    会议初步总结了全国文工团工作的成绩和经验。据此次会议统计，全国现有文工团三○五个、团员近二万人（部队文工团远超过此数，未统计在内）。文工团配合每个时期的政治任务，通过各种新艺术形式对群众进行了广泛的宣传。近十年来，它们已创作了不少优秀的剧本，歌词，并创造与推广了新的歌剧与群众性的舞蹈。会议对文工团的作用，给与了充分的估价。
    会议根据新的情况规定了今后文工团的方针、任务与分工。会议确定文工团的总任务为大力发展人民的新歌剧、新话剧、新音乐、新舞蹈，以革命精神和爱国精神教育广大人民。文工团工作应与戏曲改革工作分工合作：一方面改革旧戏曲，一方面发展新戏剧、新音乐、新舞蹈，两方面相辅相成，向着建设民族新艺术的总目标迈进。
    关于全国文工团的分工，会议规定：中央、大行政区及有条件的大城市，设剧院或专门化的剧团，以剧场演出为主，逐步建设剧场艺术；省及中等城市设剧团或以演剧为主的综合性文工团，剧场演出（在省会）与巡回演出（在所属城市与农村）并重；专区视需要与可能设以演剧或演唱为主的综合性文工队，主要在城镇与农村巡回演出。全国的文工团，整个的说来，仍应以面向广大农村和市镇，作巡回演出为主；普及工作是文工团第一位的任务。各种文工团均必须在一定范围内辅导工厂、农村群众业余的戏剧及其他艺术的活动，并与群众业余艺术组织建立固定的、经常的辅导关系。
    为提高文工团的创作与演出水平，会议认为全国各地文工团都必须建立工作制度和学习制度；每年抽出两个月到三个月的时间，进行全年的总结和整训。会议特别强调创作的重要。各大行政区和有条件的省、市，应集中一定的创作力量，根据各个时期的政治任务，有计划地组织创作。会议期间，中央文化部艺术管理局负责同志与各大行政区代表团团长分别交换了意见，初步分配了各大行政区文工团今年下半年的创作任务。
    会议听取并讨论了文化部沈雁冰部长关于文工团的方针、任务与分工的报告。为交流各方面的工作经验，会上有东北、西北、华东、中南、内蒙各区，山西、河北两省，上海、北京两市及中国人民志愿军总政治部文工团等代表作了典型发言；老舍、田汉、李伯钊、宋之的、张庚、吕骥、焦菊隐、吴晓邦等作了有关创作与文工团业务学习的专题发言。最后由周扬副部长作了会议总结。全体代表关于今后文工团的方针、任务与分工获得了一致的意见。他们在听取了各种专题发言与典型发言后，感到学习了不少东西。
