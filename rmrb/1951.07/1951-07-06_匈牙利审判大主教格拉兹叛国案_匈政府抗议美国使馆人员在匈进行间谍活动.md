Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 3rd: The Budapest Revolutionary Tribunal of Hungary tried and sentenced Archbishop Grősz for treason from June 22nd to 28th. During the public trial from the 22nd to the 27th, all the criminals in the treason case confessed their crimes. Their confessions uniformly confirmed the conspiracy of American imperialism to subvert people's democratic countries by utilizing religion.

The principal culprit in the case, Grősz, Archbishop of Kalocsa in Hungary, confessed that in the autumn of 1948, he participated in a secret meeting of senior clerics convened by the traitor Archbishop Mindszenty, where they jointly conspired to subvert the Hungarian People's Republic. After Mindszenty was arrested in February 1949, he continued to lead the subversive activities in the autumn of the same year according to Mindszenty's pre-arranged plan. Grősz confessed that he intended to restore the Habsburg dynasty "by overthrowing the government of the People's Republic, armed rebellion, and by means of American aid." His activities were supported by the U.S. Embassy in Hungary, and he once sent a written report detailing his conspiracy activities to the U.S. Embassy through his accomplice Farkas. He also maintained contact with Otto von Habsburg, the Hungarian royal family exiled abroad, U.S. Cardinal Spellman, and Vatican Secretary of State Montini through the U.S., British, Italian, and Belgian embassies in Hungary. Grősz had decided on the list of candidates for the "new government." The "ministers" of the "new government" decided in the drafted "political program" to return 500 holds of land to each landlord and to guarantee full compensation for the "losses" of the landlords.

The defendant Farkas, a former church administrator, had participated in various fascist organizations. Farkas confessed during the trial that he had connections with the secretary of the U.S. Embassy in Hungary and Pongrácz, who worked at the embassy, and that he passed information to foreign countries on behalf of Grősz. Farkas also confessed that at the request of the U.S. Embassy, he had begun to form armed commando units from former Horthy officers and police officers and had begun to organize a special conference to replace the parliament after the coup. Farkas also confessed that they were expecting Tito's help. Father Poszik, who served as Mindszenty's secret advisor, confessed that he had actively participated in fascist organizations as early as 1920 and had close ties with Mindszenty's conspiracy organization after 1946. He confessed that he had been ordered to organize armed groups including former police and gendarmerie officers. The traitor Vessely confessed to killing Soviet soldiers who liberated Hungary, and the traitor Hevey confessed that he had been ordered to organize armed terrorist groups. Traitors such as Pongrácz also admitted their crimes.

On the 26th, the court also listened to the statements of the defense lawyers and the final statements of the defendants. The court pronounced its verdict on the 28th, sentencing Grősz, the principal culprit who led the subversive activities, to fifteen years of imprisonment, sentencing Farkas and five other accomplices, including Poszik, to imprisonment ranging from eight to fourteen years, and sentencing Vessely, the murderer, to death. Pongrácz, who was guilty of espionage for stealing military intelligence, will be handed over to a military court for handling. The crimes of the defendant Hevey in organizing armed groups have not yet been determined and will be tried separately. Prosecutor Alapi announced that he agreed with the verdict against the defendant Vessely, but would appeal the verdict against the five defendants, including Farkas, requesting more severe punishment. The case will be transferred to the Hungarian Supreme Court for handling.

Xinhua News Agency, 4th: According to TASS, Budapest: The Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered a note to the U.S. Embassy in Hungary on the 2nd. The note stated that, according to the recent trial of the Grősz and his accomplices by the competent Hungarian court, the confessions of the defendants and witnesses, as well as various pieces of physical evidence, have proven that nine officials who have served or are currently serving at the U.S. Embassy have violated the most basic requirements of international law and have interfered in the internal affairs of the Hungarian state in an extremely unreasonable manner. They abused diplomatic privileges to engage in illegal activities hostile to the Hungarian working people and their country. Officials of the U.S. Embassy have established close ties with the anti-people Horthy and Szálasi elements, instigating them to engage in espionage activities and organizing conspiracies aimed at abolishing land reform, nationalization, and democratic rights. These officials ordered the leaders involved in the conspiracy to establish a bloody counter-revolutionary terrorist government to replace the legitimate government of the Hungarian People's Republic. The U.S. Embassy also hired Pongrácz after obtaining his past criminal materials. Pongrácz systematically carried out espionage missions for the U.S. Embassy while also serving as a bridge between the leaders of the anti-people conspiracy and the U.S. Embassy.

The note emphasized that the U.S. Embassy in Hungary has, in fact, without exception, participated in all the fascist conspiracies that have been exposed in recent years. This is closely linked to the overall policy of the United States, which is to support in various ways the remnant Hitlerian dogs of Szálasi who have fled abroad and to cooperate with them.

The note concluded by saying that the Hungarian government solemnly protests this behavior of the U.S. government and suggests that the U.S. government immediately replace those U.S. Embassy officials who have been proven to have engaged in espionage and sabotage activities during the Grősz trial; otherwise, the Hungarian government will have to take necessary measures. The Hungarian government suggests that the U.S. government should close all U.S. Information Service libraries, cinemas, and concert halls used to disguise espionage and sabotage activities.

　　匈牙利审判大主教格拉兹叛国案
    匈政府抗议美国使馆人员在匈进行间谍活动
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：六月二十二日到二十八日，匈牙利布达佩斯革命委员会法庭审讯并判决了大主教格拉兹叛国案。在二十二日到二十七日公开审讯的过程中，叛国案中各罪犯都供认了自己的罪行。他们的供词一致证实美帝国主义利用宗教颠覆人民民主国家的阴谋。
    本案主犯格拉兹是匈牙利卡洛萨地方的大主教，他供认：在一九四八年秋天，他曾参加叛国犯明曾蒂大主教召集的高级教士秘密会议，共同商量颠覆匈牙利人民共和国的阴谋。一九四九年二月明曾蒂被捕后，他就在同年秋天按照明曾蒂的预定计划，继续领导颠覆活动。格拉兹供认：他打算“用推翻人民共和国政权、武装暴动，以及借美国援助的方法”来恢复哈布斯堡王朝。他的活动得到美国驻匈牙利公使馆的支持，他曾经通过他的同谋法卡斯，给美国公使馆送去一份叙述自己的阴谋活动详情的书面报告。他并且经过美国、英国、意大利和比利时的驻匈使馆，和流亡国外的匈牙利旧王族奥托·哈布斯堡，美国红衣主教斯培尔曼以及梵蒂冈国务总理孟提尼等人保持联系。格拉兹曾经决定了“新政府”的人选，“新政府”的“部长”们在所拟定的“政纲”中，决定交还每一个地主五百霍尔德的土地，并保证对地主的“损失”给予充分的补偿。
    被告法卡斯是前教会管理人，曾参加各种法西斯组织。法卡斯在审讯中供认他和美国驻匈公使馆的秘书以及在公使馆工作的朋格拉契有联系，并替格拉兹向国外传递情报。法卡斯并供出他在美国公使馆的要求下，已开始把以前霍尔梯的军官和警官组成武装别动队，并已着手组织在政变后代替议会的特别会议。法卡斯又供认他们还期待着铁托的帮助。曾任明曾蒂秘密顾问的神父波希克供认他在一九二○年就积极参加法西斯组织，一九四六年以后又和明曾蒂的阴谋组织有密切联系。他供认曾奉命组织包括过去警察和宪兵军官的武装团体。叛国犯维塞供认曾杀害解放匈牙利的苏军战士，叛国犯海威供认他曾奉命组织武装恐怖团体，朋格拉契等叛国犯也都承认了他们的罪行。
    法庭在二十六日并听取了辩护律师的发言和各被告的最后申辩。法庭于二十八日宣判，判处领导颠覆活动的主犯格拉兹有期徒刑十五年，判处法卡斯及波希克等五名从犯八年到十四年的有期徒刑，判处杀人凶手维塞死刑。犯有窃取军事情报的间谍罪的朋格拉契将移交军事法庭处理。被告海威在组织武装团体方面的罪行尚未确定，将单独加以审理。检察官阿拉皮宣布同意对被告维塞的判决，但对被告法卡斯等五人的判决则将提出上诉，要求予以更严厉的惩处。此案将移交匈牙利最高法院处理。
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：匈牙利外交部二日以照会一件递交美国驻匈公使馆。照会说：根据最近匈牙利主管法庭对格拉兹及其同谋犯一案的审讯，被告和证人的口供以及各种物证业已证明：有九名曾在美国公使馆供职或现在仍在美国公使馆供职的官员，曾违反国际法的最基本的要求，极端无理地干涉匈牙利国家的内政。他们滥用外交特权，进行敌视匈牙利劳动人民及其国家的非法活动。美国公使馆的官员曾与反人民的霍尔梯及查拉绥分子建立密切联系，唆使他们从事间谍活动，组织旨在废除土地改革、国有化及民主权利的阴谋。这些官员命令参与阴谋的首领们建立血腥的反革命的恐怖政府，以代替匈牙利人民共和国的合法政府。美国公使馆并在获得霍尔梯的卑鄙间谍和秘密警察朋格拉契过去的罪恶材料后录用了他。朋格拉契一方面有计划地执行美国公使馆的间谍任务，一方面又充当反人民的阴谋的首领们与美国公使馆之间的桥梁。
    照会强调指出：美国驻匈公使馆实际上毫无例外地参加了近几年来被揭露了的一切法西斯阴谋。这与美国的总的政策是紧密联系着的，美国的这种政策就是多方支持逃往国外的残留的希特勒走狗查拉绥分子，并与他们合作。
    照会最后说：匈牙利政府郑重抗议美国政府的这种行为，并建议美国政府立即撤换那些在审讯格拉兹一案时证明曾进行间谍及破坏活动的美国公使馆官员，否则匈牙利政府将不得不采取必要措施。匈牙利政府建议美国政府应封闭所有用以掩饰间谍和破坏活动的美国新闻处的图书馆、电影院和音乐厅。
