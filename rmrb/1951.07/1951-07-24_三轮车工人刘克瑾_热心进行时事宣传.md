　　Tricycle Worker Liu Kejin
　　Enthusiastically Conducts Current Affairs Propaganda
　　Liu Kejin, a tricycle worker in the Third District of Beijing, is a propaganda member of the labor union. He conscientiously implemented the article in the city's tricycle workers' patriotic convention that "advertise to passengers while pulling them, and advertise at the vehicle stop when parked," and conducted anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda to the masses at all times and places.
　　Liu Kejin is twenty years old this year and came from a poor family since childhood. He picked coal cinders at the age of eight, picked waste paper at the age of twelve, sold newspapers at the age of fifteen, and started pedaling at the age of eighteen. He has never studied in school. After the liberation of Beijing, he participated in adult night school. After a year and a half of hard work, he can already write simple letters and can barely read newspapers. This April, he was selected as a propaganda member in the labor union. How to propagandize? And to whom? He remembered the article in the city's tricycle workers' patriotic convention that "advertise to passengers while pulling them, and advertise at the vehicle stop when parked." But what to propagandize? He decided to study first.
　　First of all, he began to strengthen his reading of newspapers. He often went to the People's Daily newspaper board across from the Youth League and the China Youth Daily newspaper board at the entrance of the Youth Service Department to read newspapers and find propaganda materials. The newspaper board happened to be the parking spot, so reading the newspaper didn't delay picking up passengers.
　　He also took advantage of his work to talk about current affairs with passengers at any time. If the passenger understood more principles than him, he would raise some questions that the tricycle workers asked him but he could not solve himself and ask them for advice. After he understood the problem himself, he would propagandize to the tricycle workers. If the passenger was very unfamiliar with current affairs, he would propagandize the anti-American and aid-Korea principles he understood to the passengers. In this way, many passengers became very familiar with him.
　　After he became a propaganda member, he bought magazines such as "Current Affairs Handbook" and "Learn Culture." When he rested at the vehicle stop, he would take out the books and distribute them to the tricycle workers to read. Some workers were illiterate, so he read and explained to them at the same time.
　　After the movement to donate airplanes and cannons was launched, in addition to going out early and returning late to pull more passengers to actively donate himself, he also publicized the great significance of the donation movement to tricycle workers and passengers. Some tricycle workers were worried that "too much is unaffordable, and too little is useless." He explained to them: "Donation is not about the amount, as long as you do your best. If the people of the whole country rise up, our national defense construction can be greatly strengthened." He also introduced his own situation of going out early and returning late to pull more passengers, increasing income, and donating weapons to everyone, which influenced many tricycle workers to actively participate in the donation movement.

　　三轮车工人刘克瑾
　  热心进行时事宣传
    北京市第三区三轮车工人刘克瑾，是工会的宣传队员。他认真执行了全市三轮车工人爱国公约中“拉座向乘客宣传，停车在车口宣传”的条文，随时随地向群众进行抗美援朝的宣传。
    刘克瑾今年二十岁，自小家庭贫苦。他八岁拣煤核，十二岁拣烂纸，十五岁卖报，十八岁开始蹬车，从来没有念过书。北京解放后，他参加了成人夜校学习。经过一年半的努力，他已经能够写简单的信，还能凑合着看报纸。今年四月，他在工会被选为宣传队员。怎样宣传呢？向谁宣传呢？他想起了全市三轮车工人爱国公约中订有“拉座向乘客宣传，停车在车口宣传”的条文。可是，宣传些什么呢？他决定先学习。
    首先，他开始加强阅读报纸。他常到青年会对面的人民日报报牌和青年服务部门口中国青年报报牌等处去看报，找宣传材料。报牌那里正好是停车处，看报还不耽误拉座。
    他又利用自己工作的方便，随时和乘客谈时事。如果乘客懂的道理比他多，他就提出一些三轮车工友们问他而他自己不能解决的问题向他们请教。自己把问题搞懂后，再向三轮车工友们进行宣传。如果乘客对时事很不熟悉，他就把自己懂得的抗美援朝的道理向乘客宣传。这样，许多乘客都和他搞得很熟悉。
    他当了宣传队员后，就买了《时事手册》、《学文化》等杂志。到车口休息时，他就把书拿出来，分给三轮工友们看。有些工友不识字，他就一面念一面向他们讲解。
    捐献飞机大炮运动展开后，他除了自己早出晚收多拉座来积极捐献外，还向三轮车工友和乘客们宣传了捐献运动的伟大意义。有些三轮车工人顾虑“多了拿不起，少了不顶事”。他就向他们解释：“捐献不在数目多少，只要自己尽到力量。如果全国人民都起来，我们的国防建设就能大大加强。”他又把自己早出晚收多拉座、增加收入捐献武器的情况向大家介绍，影响了很多三轮车工人积极参加捐献运动。
