　　Cadres of the China National Food Corporation's Tangshan Branch
　　Severely Punished for Embezzlement and Dereliction of Duty

　　Manager Lin Tong, former Deputy Manager Sun Naiting, Deputy Manager Wang Wei, and several other cadres of the China National Food Corporation's Hebei Province Tangshan Branch, engaged in serious dereliction of duty, bribery, embezzlement, theft, and other illegal and undisciplined behavior, plunging the company's operations into chaos and causing severe damage to national assets and the government's prestige. In terms of losses to national assets alone, incomplete statistics show a figure of around 600 million yuan. The Hebei Provincial People's Supervisory Committee has now thoroughly investigated the case and, with the approval of the Central People's Supervisory Committee, has imposed severe punishments on the cadres responsible for illegal acts and dereliction of duty. The Discipline Inspection Committee of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has also, with the approval of the Discipline Inspection Committee of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, imposed disciplinary measures within the Party on the Party member cadres responsible for illegal acts and dereliction of duty.
  A. Facts of Embezzlement and Illegal Activities
　　(1) Colluding with Private Merchants to Damage National Assets: Manager Lin Tong, former Deputy Manager Sun Naiting, Chief of the Secretariat Section Zhu Youmin, and other cadres of the company frequently accepted banquets, gifts, and other bribes from private merchants. Wang Chunfen, a clerk in the company, even succumbed to the seduction of being provided prostitutes by private merchants. As a result, these individuals consciously used national assets to "repay favors" to private merchants. For example, they transferred company funds to private merchant Zhang Kejin to organize the "Fu Ju Xing Trading Company," causing the company to be owed over 10,000 jin of millet; allowed private merchant Xiangtailong to purchase railway sleepers for profit, earning 30,000 jin of millet (which could have been purchased directly by the company); and allowed private merchant Dongxingda to sell soybean oil on consignment, failing to adjust prices as the oil price rose, allowing them to illegally profit more than 9 million yuan. During inspection and processing, they deliberately created difficulties or stopped processing for private merchants who did not offer bribes.
　　(2) Disorderly System, Serious Theft and Waste: According to preliminary checks, there were 53 instances of missing original receipts for the purchase of mats and railway sleepers alone between January and September 1950. Entire grain stacks were not recorded in the accounts, and the amount of grain in storage did not match the amount recorded in the books. For example, a shortage of more than 310,000 jin of grain was discovered in the mine grain depot, while another depot had an excess of 130,000 jin, resulting in a net difference of 170,000 jin. Grade A grain was sold as Grade B grain. Grain was not weighed when paid to private merchants for processing. The private merchant Xiangtailong claimed to be short 10,000 jin when delivering grain, which could not be verified. Incidents of cadre embezzlement and theft occurred continuously, resulting in the loss of over 10,000 mats and more than 5,900 sacks, totaling over 480 million yuan in Renminbi. The leadership either failed to discover these problems for a long time or failed to handle them seriously after they were discovered.
　　(3) Embezzlement and Self-Interest, Mutual Cover-Up: Manager Lin Tong, former Deputy Manager Sun Naiting, and four other individuals borrowed public funds 60 times in half a year; and used tens of millions of yuan of company funds for employee cooperatives to engage in speculative commerce, earning profits of approximately 30 million yuan in four months, which were distributed among the members, forming a form of disguised collective embezzlement. Gao Junwen, a cadre stationed in Tianjin, engaged in gambling and corruption and conducted private business, depositing over 30 million yuan in the bank. When he returned to the company to settle accounts, former Deputy Manager Sun Naiting knew that his problems were serious but did not listen to the opinions of the masses to investigate and deal with the matter, resulting in Gao Junwen abandoning his post and absconding. Chen Xiutian frequently embezzled and had a very bad work style, and had previously surrendered his gun to the enemy; but because he was an acquaintance of Sun Naiting and frequently invited leading cadres to dinner, he was promoted to Deputy Chief of the Secretariat Section. Yu Jianhua deserted while being transferred south; but because he knew Lin Tong, he was also recruited to participate in the company's work and was promoted to manager of the employee cooperative.
　　(4) Submitting False Reports to Deceive Superiors: Ma Yunfu, Chief of the Storage and Transportation Section, and Deputy Manager Wang Wei, in order to make up for grain shortages, falsely reported losses of 574,000 jin of grain to the superior company, while the actual losses were only 195,000 jin.
  B. Results of Handling
　　Manager Lin Tong (Communist Party member) was irresponsible in his work, appointed and promoted personal acquaintances, colluded with private merchants, condoned bribery by cadres who were derelict in their duties, failed to intervene in private merchant malpractice, and used company funds for employee cooperatives to engage in speculative trading. Therefore, he should bear important responsibility for this case. Lin Tong not only failed to examine his own mistakes after the fact, but instead resisted leadership. The government has given him the punishment of dismissal from his post and investigation, and the Party has given him the punishment of probation within the Party for two years.
　　Former Deputy Manager Sun Naiting (Communist Party member, already transferred to the Tongxian Branch) had the closest relationship with private merchants, took the lead in colluding with private merchants and accepting bribes from them. He violated company resolutions by privately lending sacks to Yin Pinde, manager of the Dongxingda firm, whom he knew; and colluded with Zhang Yaoting, Chief of the Business Section, to give private merchants "repayment for human feelings" using state assets when entrusting private merchants with processing and consignment sales of soybean oil and grain; and appointed his acquaintance Chen Xiutian and protected and condoned the embezzler Gao Junwen. The government has given him the punishment of dismissal from his post, and the Party has given him the punishment of expulsion from the Party.
　　Deputy Manager Wang Wei (Communist Party member) was irresponsible in his work after taking office, neither reported the serious problems existing in the company to the superior level, nor criticized and educated the subordinates; and submitted false reports to the superior level, falsely reporting grain damage and loss. The government has given him the punishment of dismissal from his post, and the Party has given him the punishment of removal from his post.
　　Zhang Yaoting, Chief of the Business Section (Communist Party member), colluded with private merchants, intentionally caused the company to suffer serious losses when private merchant Xiangtailong processed grain and purchased railway sleepers on consignment, and when private merchant Dongxingda sold soybean oil on consignment; and shielded Yang Zhenhuan and Wang Chunfen, cadres who accepted bribes during inspection and processing; and sold Grade A grain as Grade B grain when selling grain. The government has given him the punishment of dismissal from his post and legal action, and the Party has given him the punishment of expulsion from the Party.
　　Zhu Youmin, Chief of the Secretariat Section and concurrently Chief of the Personnel Section (Communist Party member), was corrupt and degenerate, embezzled and accepted bribes, and personally bought railway sleepers on behalf of the company, profiting more than 2 million yuan from it. The government has given him the punishment of dismissal from his post and legal action, and the Party has given him the punishment of expulsion from the Party.
　　Pei Qingduo, Director of the Employee Cooperative (Communist Party member), borrowed company funds for the cooperative to engage in speculative trading and obtain illegal profits, was given the punishment of dismissal from his post, and the Party gave him the punishment of probation within the Party for one year.
　　Deng Shuxun, Instructor of the Transportation Team (Communist Party member), Dou Qingxiang, Chief of the Storage and Transportation Section (Communist Party member), Cai Jifeng, Chief of the Storage and Transportation Section (Communist Party member), and Ma Yunfu, Chief of the Storage and Transportation Section (Communist Party member), were irresponsible in their work and unaware of the theft of materials. The government gave them education and dismissal punishments respectively, and the Party gave them public warning punishments.
　　Chen Xiutian, former Deputy Chief of the Secretariat Section, colluded with private merchants and was corrupt and degenerate, and has been given the punishment of dismissal from his post and investigation. Wang Chunfen, a clerk, and Yang Zhenhuan, an intern, embezzled and accepted bribes, and were both dismissed. Yu Jianhua, manager of the employee cooperative, should bear certain responsibility for the incident in which private merchants earned huge profits for the company by buying railway sleepers on consignment from private merchants; but his self-examination and review are still profound, so he is temporarily leniently exempted from punishment to observe future performance.
　　In addition, the Party branch of the company neither criticized nor corrected this problem, nor did it report it to the higher level in a timely manner. The Party gave the punishment of partial reorganization; the Party branch secretary, Li Xing, received a public warning punishment. The Hebei Provincial Department of Commerce and the Hebei Provincial Grain Company, which administratively led the company, should bear certain responsibility for the long-term serious errors existing in the company, and should also conduct a review.

　　中国粮食公司唐山分公司
　  干部贪污失职受到严厉处分
    中国粮食公司河北省唐山分公司经理林彤、前副经理孙乃亭、副经理王维及该公司若干干部，发生严重的失职、受贿、贪污、偷盗等违法乱纪的行为，使该公司的业务陷于混乱状态，国家资财、政府威信受到严重的损失。仅就国家资财损失来说，据不完全统计，即达六亿元左右。现河北省人民监察委员会已将此案调查清楚，并呈准中央人民监察委员会给违法失职干部以严厉处分；中共河北省委员会纪律检查委员会亦已呈准中共中央华北局纪律检查委员会，对违法失职的党员干部，给以党内处分。
  甲、贪污违法事实
    （一）勾结私商，损害国家资财：该公司经理林彤、前副经理孙乃亭、秘书科长朱佑民等干部，经常接受私商宴请、馈赠以及财物等贿赂。该公司办事员王春芬竟接受私商宿娼的引诱。因而，这些人就有意识地用国家资财，向私商“补报人情”。如以公司资金转借给私商张克进组织“复巨兴商号”，使该号拖欠公司小米万余斤；让私商祥泰隆代购枕木取利三万斤小米（本来是可以自买的）；让私商东兴大代售豆油，油价上涨不换牌价，使其非法获利九百多万元。在检查加工时，对不给贿赂的私商，则故意为难或停止其加工。
    （二）制度紊乱，偷盗、浪费严重：据初步检查，一九五○年一月至九月间，只买席及枕木两项，就有五十三笔没有原始单据。整囤粮食不写账，库存粮数与账载粮数不符。如矿场粮库曾发现短粮三十一万余斤，另一库则长粮十三万余斤，长短相抵差十七万余斤。甲字粮当成乙字粮卖。付私商加工粮时不过磅，私商祥太隆交粮时硬说缺少一万斤，也无法查考。干部贪污、偷盗事件不断发生，损失席子万余领、麻袋五千九百余条，两项计算，折合人民币四亿八千余万元。以上问题，领导上有的长期没有发现，发现后也不认真处理。
    （三）贪污营私，互相包庇：经理林彤、前副经理孙乃亭等五人，半年中借公款六十次；并以公司数千万元的资金，供职工合作社从事投机商业，四个月获利约三千万元，为社员分用，形成变相的集体贪污。驻天津的干部高俊文，赌博腐化，私人作买卖，在银行存款三千余万元。他回公司交账时，前副经理孙乃亭明知其问题严重，但并不听取群众意见调查处理这件事，结果使高俊文弃职潜逃。陈秀田经常贪污，作风很坏，过去又曾向敌人缴过枪；但因为他是孙乃亭的熟人，并且时常请领导干部吃饭，因此，竟被提拔为秘书科副科长。于建华南调时开小差；但因和林彤相识，亦被吸收参加公司工作，并被提升为职工合作社经理。
    （四）做假报告，欺骗上级：储运股长马云福及副经理王维，为弥补粮食缺数，向上级公司假报伤耗五十七万四千余斤，实际只有十九万五千斤损耗。
  乙、处理结果
    经理林彤（中共党员），工作不负责任，任用并提拔私人，与私商拉拢，纵容受贿失职干部，对私商舞弊不加过问，并以公司资金给职工合作社作投机买卖。因此，他对此案应负重要责任。林彤事后不但不检讨自己的错误，反而对抗领导。政府已予以撤职查办处分，党内给以留党察看二年处分。
    前副经理孙乃亭（中共党员，已调通县分公司工作），和私商关系最密切，带头拉拢私商、接受私商贿赂。他与私商东兴大号经理尹聘德相识，就违犯公司决议，私自借予麻袋，并和业务科长张耀庭勾结，在委托私商加工及代售豆油、粮食时，以国家资材给私商“补报人情”；并任用私人陈秀田，包庇放纵贪污分子高俊文。政府已予撤职处分，党内给以开除党籍处分。
    副经理王维（中共党员），到职后工作不负责任，对公司中存在的严重问题，既不向上级反映，又不对下级进行批评教育；并向上级作假报告，虚报粮食伤耗。政府已予撤职处分，党内给以撤销工作处分。
    业务科长张耀庭（中共党员），与私商拉拢，让私商祥泰隆粮食加工、代购枕木和让私商东兴大代售豆油时，有意使公司受到严重损失，并包庇在检查加工时受贿的干部杨振寰、王春芬；卖粮时把甲字粮当乙字粮卖。政府已予撤职法办处分，党内给以开除党籍处分。
    秘书科长兼人事科长朱佑民（中共党员），腐化堕落，贪污受贿，本人并代公司买枕木，从中获利二百多万元。政府已予撤职法办处分，党内给以开除党籍处分。
    职工合作社主任裴庆多（中共党员），借公司资金由合作社经营投机买卖，博取非法利润，予以撤职处分，党内给以留党察看一年处分。
    运输队指导员邓树勋（中共党员）、储运股长窦庆祥（中共党员）及储运科长蔡季丰（中共党员）、储运股长马云福（中共党员），对工作不负责任，对物资失盗毫无所知，政府分别予以教育及撤职处分，党内给以当众警告处分。
    前秘书科副科长陈秀田，勾结私商，贪污腐化，已予撤职查办处分。办事员王春芬、练习生杨振环，贪污受贿，均予开除。职工合作社经理于建华，对私商给公司代买枕木赚取国家厚利事件，应负一定责任；但其反省检讨尚属深刻，暂从宽免予处分，以观后效。
    此外，该公司党支部对此问题既不批评纠正，亦不及时向上反映，党给予部分改组处分；党支部书记李兴受当众警告处分。在行政上领导该公司的河北省商业厅、河北省粮食公司，对该公司长期存在的严重错误应负一定责任，也应进行检讨。
