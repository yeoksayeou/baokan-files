Reader's Letter

To the Editor:

We railway public security personnel are very distressed because we don't receive good treatment when we get sick or injured. Many of our comrades were transferred from the army. When we were in the army, we received excellent treatment whether we were wounded or sick. Now we are on a salary system, so we can't get free medical treatment like we did under the army's supply system. But we also can't enjoy labor insurance benefits like ordinary railway workers. In addition, the work style of some medical personnel in railway hospitals is not good, so we are all afraid of getting sick and being hospitalized.

Here are a few examples from the Jinan Public Security Section of the Jinan Railway Bureau: Public security officer Pan Yunjie of the section fell and injured his left hand while patrolling the road at night in October 1950, fracturing his thumb bone. He went to Jinan Railway Hospital for treatment. Initially, the doctor said that removing the bone fragments and giving injections of streptomycin would be enough. However, after removing the fragments, they emphasized that the hospital had no medicine and delayed treatment, which has continued for over half a year. Pan Yunjie's injury has not only failed to heal, but he has also developed bone tuberculosis and contracted pulmonary tuberculosis, and his condition is very dangerous. According to the doctor, he now needs surgery to amputate his arm, which requires 30 bottles of streptomycin and 15 bottles of penicillin, the cost of which must be borne by him or his work unit. This problem cannot be solved at present. Pan Yunjie was injured on duty while patrolling the road, so why should he have to pay for the medicine himself? The hospital emphasizes that it has no medicine, but I think this is a matter of the hospital's work attitude. They see money as the first priority and human life as the second, which is completely the old society's style.

For example, railway public security officer Zheng Jincheng, who died in Jinan Railway Hospital in April this year, was a veteran of honor who was wounded in the lungs during the Huaihai Campaign. Recently, due to overwork, his wound relapsed and he was hospitalized. From November last year to April this year, the hospital did not give him proper medication and treatment. Zheng Jincheng was clearly injured on duty, and the Public Security Department had proof, but the hospital insisted that he buy five bottles of streptomycin himself. When he died, there were still four unused bottles left.

Public security officer Wang Shixin of the Jinan Plant Protection Office was wounded in the throat. The doctor said at the time that it was okay and could be treated, but he died two days later. When the mother of Yao Lianyuan, a public security officer living in Jinan, had an emergency, she called the railway hospital to send a car to pick her up, but the hospital refused. Yao Lianyuan had to carry the patient for more than ten miles to the hospital. By the time they arrived, it was already late, and the hospital emphasized that it did not meet the procedures and refused to admit her. The patient died due to the long delay. It was already midnight, but the hospital did not allow them to stay and forced them to carry the dead person out in the middle of the night.

In the past, we have reported these situations to the leading cadres of the Jinan Railway Bureau many times and personally reflected them to the Health Department of the Railway Bureau, but they have never been resolved. This problem seriously threatens the health of railway public security personnel and affects their work morale. Some people have been unable to get treatment for their illnesses, leading to pessimistic suicide, and this has happened more than once. Of course, it is wrong for them to commit suicide, but it also shows that this problem urgently needs to be resolved.

We now have two requests: first, we hope that the higher leading organs can formulate appropriate measures for the treatment of illnesses and injuries of railway public security personnel; second, we hope to thoroughly correct the bureaucratic and negligent attitude towards human life of some medical personnel in Jinan Railway Hospital and establish a new medical work style of serving the people wholeheartedly.

Jinan Railway Public Security Department, Fang Ruixin

Editor's Note: The medical treatment of railway public security personnel is a widespread and urgent problem that needs to be solved. At present, the public security personnel and police of the national people's railways are all on a low-salary system. When they encounter illness or injury, most of them have no money for treatment and recuperation. They cannot enjoy free treatment under the supply system, nor can they enjoy labor insurance benefits like ordinary workers because they are public servants of the state. Therefore, many of them cannot get treatment for their illnesses, which affects their health and work. We believe that the two requests made by reader Fang Ruixin are correct. Regarding the first point, please respond to the Ministry of Railways as to whether it is feasible; regarding the second point, we hope that Jinan Railway Hospital will investigate and respond.

### 铁路公安人员伤病医疗问题有关领导机关应予适当解决

专栏：读者来信

    铁路公安人员伤病医疗问题有关领导机关应予适当解决编辑同志：
    我们铁路公安人员得病或受伤后，得不到很好的治疗，大家对这事很感苦恼。我们有很多同志原是从部队上转来的，当在部队的时候，不论负伤或得病，都得到很好的治疗。我们现在是薪金制，不能象在部队的供给制那样，可以免费治病；但又不象一般铁路职工那样，可以享受劳动保险待遇；再加铁路医院某些医务人员的作风不好，我们都怕生病住医院。这里我举出济南铁路局济南公安段的几个例子：该段公安员潘云杰于一九五○年十月夜间巡路时将左手跌伤，手拇指骨头跌断。他到济南铁路医院医治，最初大夫说，取出碎骨打上链霉素药针就可以好。但取出碎骨后，却强调院里没有药，迟迟不理，至今已半年多。潘云杰非但伤处未好，反又增加了骨结核，并又给传染上了肺结核，病情已很危险。据大夫说，现在必需动手术把胳膊锯掉，但这需要打链霉素三十瓶、盘尼西林十五瓶，药费需由本人或本单位来负担，这问题现在就无法解决。潘云杰为了巡路而跌伤，是因公受伤，为什么还要个人买药呢？医院强调没有药，我认为这是医院的工作态度问题。他们把钱看成第一位，把人命看成第二位，完全是旧社会的作风。如今年四月死在济南铁路医院的铁路公安人员郑金成同志，他原是荣誉军人，在淮海战役时肺部负伤，近因工作疲劳，伤口复发，住到医院。自去年十一月至今年四月，医院不给好好用药医治。郑金成明明是公伤，公安处有证明，但医院硬要他个人出钱买了五瓶链霉素，到他死时还剩下四瓶未用。济南护厂所公安员王世信同志喉部负伤，当时大夫说没关系，可以治疗，但过两天就死了。济南住在所公安人员姚连元的母亲有急病，打电话叫铁路医院派汽车去接，医院不去，姚连元只好抬着病人走了十多里路去医院。到时，天已晚了，医院强调不合手续，不收；病人因拖延时间过长而死亡。当时已是半夜了，医院不叫停留，硬逼着深夜把死人抬出去。过去我们曾将这些情况三番五次地报告给济南铁路局领导干部，并亲去铁路局卫生处反映，但始终得不到解决。这问题严重威胁着铁路公安人员的健康，影响着他们的工作情绪。曾有人得病无法治疗，以致悲观自杀，且这样的事情不止一次。他们自杀当然不对，但也说明这问题迫切需要解决。现在我们有两点要求：第一、希望上级领导机关对铁路公安人员的病伤医治，能定出适当的办法；第二、彻底纠正济南铁路医院某些医务人员官僚主义和玩忽人命的态度，建立新的忠心为人民服务的医疗作风。
                济南铁路公安处  方锐心
    编者按：铁路公安人员的病伤治疗是一个普遍存在的和亟待解决的问题。现在全国人民铁路的公安人员和警察都是低薪制待遇，他们遇到病伤，多半自己无钱治疗和休养；而他们既不能享受供给制待遇的免费治疗，又因为他们是国家的公役人员，不能象一般职工那样可以享受劳动保险待遇。所以，他们很多人得了病没办法治，影响健康，影响工作。我们认为读者方锐心所提的两点要求是正确的，对第一点，是否可行，请铁道部给以答复；对第二点，希望济南铁路医院检查答复。
