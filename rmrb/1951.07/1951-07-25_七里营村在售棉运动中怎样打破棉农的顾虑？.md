　　How Did Qiliying Village Dispel Cotton Farmers' Concerns During the Cotton Selling Campaign?
    In the comprehensive patriotic cotton selling and storing campaign in Xinxiang County, Plain Province, Qiliying Village was the first to achieve good results. In the thirteen days since early July, the village's farmers have sold nearly 50,000 jin of cotton.
  Many Cotton Farmers Have Concerns
    The process of purchasing and storing cotton in the village was not smooth sailing, but rather developed after overcoming biases. At the beginning of the work, the village held meetings of Party members, Youth League members, people's representatives, and mass meetings, explaining both inside and outside the Party that selling and storing cotton was a patriotic action to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and was of great significance to national defense and economic construction, and publicizing the specific methods of selling and storing cotton, and the state's consideration of the interests of cotton farmers. After these meetings, Party members, Youth League members, and some politically active cotton farmers brought out their cotton; however, most of the masses were still unwilling to bring it out. The reason was that they had many specific concerns that had not been dispelled. Some cotton farmers said: "If the cotton is stored in the cooperative, will we be able to take it out at will when we want to marry, or build a house?" Some said: "The government is calling for selling cotton and donating, now if we sell more cotton, will it be less glorious if we donate less in the future? People will say we are backward!" Some suspected that storing cotton in the cooperative would be "confiscated and nationalized" in the future. Some were afraid that they would not be able to buy wheat after selling cotton, saying: "No matter what you say, I have an old idea: don't release the hawk until you see the rabbit (meaning don't sell cotton until you see wheat)!"
  Coercive Orders Won't Work
    Cadres and activists did not go deep into each household to understand these concerns, only talking about general principles. As a result, at the meetings, those who had less cotton to store spoke more, and those who had more cotton to store did not speak. Cadres and activists became impatient, and some wanted to use "labeling" or other coercive methods to force cotton out. They said to the masses: "Whoever has cotton and doesn't bring it out is not resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea! It won't look good if it is found out in the future!" Some even said: "Don't think you won't bring it out, we will have to force it out in the future!" However, these methods did not work, and the cadres and activists were left to play a lone game.
  Address Concerns to Dispel Concerns
    Later, the village cadres conducted a review, accepted this lesson, and corrected their wrong practices. They carried out in-depth mobilization separately in the youth, women, civil school, and Young Pioneer systems. The activists of each system then went separately to their families, relatives, neighbors, and ordinary farmers with more cotton to store but who had concerns to carry out individual mobilization. In the fields, at meal times, and on the streets, people persuaded each other. They explained the principles of "protecting the country to prosper the family" and "loving the country and selling cotton"; at the same time, they explained the specific concerns of each household. For those who were afraid of donating, they emphasized that donation was not assigned, but a conscious and voluntary increase in production donation. For those who were afraid that it would be inconvenient to use the cotton if it was stored in the cooperative, they guaranteed that they would use various methods to make it convenient for them to use. For those who were afraid of nationalization in the future, they explained the state's policy of guaranteeing the fruits of labor. For those who were afraid of not being able to buy wheat or other needed materials, they guaranteed to supply their needs. At the same time, they guided everyone to recall the plunder and oppression suffered by cotton farmers during the rule of the Kuomintang and Japanese invaders, recalling the time when the Japanese invaders robbed fifty large carts of cotton at one time, putting many cotton farmers in dire straits, and conducting a comparison between the old and new societies.
  Village Enters Cotton Selling Climax
    Party members, Youth League members, and Young Pioneer team members went deep into the farmers' homes day and night, forgetting to eat and sleep to mobilize them, which gradually changed the cotton farmers' thinking and emotions. The village began to see the phenomenon of three, five, or ten households selling cotton collectively. These model deeds stirred the whole village, gradually bringing the whole village into a cotton selling climax. Women jointly sold "small portions of cotton." Civil school students beat drums and gongs, carried flags, carried cotton, shouted slogans, and promoted along the streets, calling on all cotton to be sold and stored to the state. Hundreds of teachers and students of the primary school also fully participated in this movement. Cotton farmers who were still a little hesitant before, under the mobilization of all parties, gradually made up their minds to sell and store cotton. An old man surnamed Liu was unwilling to sell cotton, and his granddaughter Liu Haoqin (a Young Pioneer team member) mobilized him without eating or sleeping; finally, he was persuaded and sold the cotton. In this way, the whole village sold and stored nearly 50,000 jin of cotton in thirteen days. Now, combined with aphid control, this movement is still being carried out. Their method of combining is to control aphids during the day and sell cotton in the evening. The enthusiasm of the masses in the whole village for selling cotton and controlling aphids is very high.

### 七里营村在售棉运动中怎样打破棉农的顾虑？

　　七里营村在售棉运动中怎样打破棉农的顾虑？
    平原新乡县在全面开展爱国售棉储棉运动中，七里营村首先取得了较好的成绩。在七月初以来的十三天中，该村农民出售棉花已近五万斤。
  许多棉农有顾虑
    该村的购棉储棉工作过程并不是一帆风顺的，而是经过克服偏向才开展起来的。工作一开始，该村曾召开党团员会议、人民代表会议及群众会议，在党内外讲解售棉储棉即是抗美援朝的爱国行动，对国防和经济建设有重大意义，宣传售棉、储棉的具体办法，和国家对棉农利益的照顾。经过这些会议，党员团员和一部分政治上积极的棉农把棉花拿出来了；但大部分群众却仍然不肯拿出来。原因是他们有许多具体的顾虑没有消除，棉农有的说：“花存到合作社里，咱要娶老婆、盖房子时究竟能不能随意取用？”有的说：“政府又叫卖花，又叫捐献，现在卖花多了，将来捐献少了不光荣，人家要说咱落后！”有的怀疑存到合作社将来会被“没收归公”。有的怕卖了棉花买不到麦子，说：“不管你说什么，反正我有个老主意：不见兔子不放鹰（即不见麦子不卖棉）！”
  强迫命令行不通
    干部、积极分子没有深入各户去了解这些顾虑，光讲一般道理，结果在开会时总是存棉少的人说话多，存棉多的人不说话。干部、积极分子们急了，有的就想用“戴帽子”或其他强迫命令的办法往出逼棉花。他们对群众说：“谁有花不拿出来，就是不抗美援朝！以后查出来可是不好看！”有的甚至说：“不怕你们不拿，将来硬压也得压出来！”但是，这些办法都没有起作用，形成干部、积极分子唱独脚戏。
  针对顾虑打破顾虑
    以后该村干部经过检讨，接受了这一教训，改正了错误的做法。他们在青年、妇女、民校、少年儿童队各系统中分头进行了深入的动员。各系统的活动分子又分头向自己的家庭、亲友、邻舍、存棉多而有顾虑的一般农户进行个别动员。田地里、饭场上、街道上，到处互相规劝。讲解“保国才能发家”、“爱国家、卖棉花”的道理；同时针对各户的具体顾虑进行解释。对怕捐献的，强调说明捐献不是派捐，而是自觉自愿的增产捐献。怕存入合作社用着不方便的，保证用各种方法使他们用着方便。怕将来归公的，给他们解释国家保证劳动所得的政策。怕买不到小麦或其他所需物资的，保证供应他们的所需。同时引导大家回忆国民党、日寇统治时期棉农所受的掠夺、压榨，回忆日寇一次抢花五十大车，使许多棉农陷于绝境的往事，进行新旧社会的对比。
  全村进入售棉高潮
    党员、团员和少年儿童队员们，不分昼夜、废寝忘食地深入农户去动员，使棉农思想情绪逐渐转变过来，村里开始出现了三户、五户、十来户集体卖棉的现象。这些模范事迹激荡着全村，使全村逐渐进入售棉高潮。妇女们联合卖出了“小份花”。民校学员敲锣打鼓，打着旗子，挑着棉花，喊着口号，沿街宣传，号召把所有的棉花都卖、存给国家。小学的数百师生也全部投入这一运动。以前还有点犹疑的棉农，在各方面的动员下，逐渐下定决心，售储棉花。有一个姓刘的老头不愿卖棉，他的孙女刘好勤（少年儿童队员）不吃饭、不睡觉地动员他；最后他终于打通思想，卖出来了。就这样，全村在十三天中售储棉花近五万斤。现在仍在结合治蚜，继续开展这一运动。他们结合的办法，是白天治蚜，晚间售棉。全村群众售棉治蚜的情绪都很高。（平原日报）
