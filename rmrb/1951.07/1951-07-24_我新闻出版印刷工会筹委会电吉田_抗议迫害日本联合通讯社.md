Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd—Fan Changjiang, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of News, Publication and Printing Workers, sent a cable to Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida, protesting the Japanese government's persecution of the progressive Japan United News Agency. The cable stated: "The Chinese news, publication, and printing workers express their serious protest against the Japanese government's unreasonable order on July 12, 1951, to the progressive Japan United News Agency to cease the nationwide distribution of 'United News,' and the simultaneous dispatch of Japanese police to illegally search the Tokyo headquarters of the United News Agency and more than 40 branch offices throughout Japan. This is a criminal act by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries who are actively plotting a separate peace treaty and rearming Japan, following the unreasonable closure of four progressive newspapers, namely 'The Worker,' 'Peace Women's News,' 'For the Motherland and Learning,' and 'New Youth News,' on May 24th of this year, attempting to further stifle the voice of the Japanese people. We demand that the Japanese government immediately rescind the reactionary order to cease the distribution of 'United News' by the United News Agency, and immediately rescind the order to close 'The Worker' and the other four progressive newspapers and prohibit their distribution."

　  抗议迫害日本联合通讯社
    【新华社二十三日讯】中国新闻出版印刷工会筹备委员会主任范长江致电日本首相吉田，抗议日本政府迫害日本进步的联合通讯社。电文称：“中国新闻出版印刷业职工，对日本政府在一九五一年七月十二日无理迫令日本进步的联合通讯社停止《联合通讯》对全国的发行，同日并派遣日本警察非法搜查联合通讯社东京总社及日本全国各地四十余个分社的反动措施，提出严重抗议。这是美、日反动派在积极策划单独媾和，重新武装日本时，继今年五月二十四日无理封闭《劳动者》、《和平妇女新闻》、《为了祖国和学问》、《新青年新闻》等四家进步报纸后，又企图进一步扼杀日本人民喉舌的罪恶行为。我们要求日本政府立即取销对联合通讯社停止发行《联合通讯》的反动命令，并立即取销封闭《劳动者》等四家进步报纸与禁止其发行的命令。
