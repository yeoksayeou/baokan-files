The Standing Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association
    Resolution on Developing Organizations for Small and Medium Industrial and Commercial Business Owners (Summary)
    The Standing Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association recently passed the "Resolution on Developing Organizations for Small and Medium Industrial and Commercial Business Owners." The summary is as follows:
    In the past year or so, our association's organizational work has been successful, with branches increasing from four to twenty-two, and membership increasing more than fivefold. However, our association's work in developing membership among small and medium industrial and commercial business owners has been quite insufficient in the past. Now, in order to implement this organizational development policy, the General Association has specially decided that future membership development should focus on small and medium industrial and commercial business owners.
    The reasons are: First, our association's current political task is to organize the broad masses of industrial and commercial business owners to universally participate in the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement. Among the industrial and commercial circles in various regions, small and medium industrial and commercial business owners always account for the absolute majority. In the past, we have not paid sufficient attention to small and medium industrial and commercial business owners in the development of organizations. In order to better complete our association's political tasks, we should closely cooperate with relevant parties and actively organize and promote the broad masses of small and medium industrial and commercial business owners to participate in various patriotic movements.
    Second, small and medium industrial and commercial enterprises account for a large proportion of the national industry and commerce today. After the completion of land reform, the broad masses of small and medium industrial and commercial business owners have development prospects. Our association must help them organize themselves, improve their management methods, and use collective strength to solve various specific problems in management and technology. According to the principle of division of labor and cooperation, under the leadership of the state-owned economy, they will exert great power for the construction of a new democratic economy.
    Third, in the current nationwide severe suppression of counter-revolutionary movements, in order to thoroughly eliminate counter-revolutionary elements, our association must more widely organize small and medium industrial and commercial business owners, rely on the strength of the masses, and boldly report counter-revolutionary elements, in order to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship.
    Fourth, in terms of the industrial and commercial circles themselves, small and medium industrial and commercial business owners were the ones who suffered the deepest oppression from imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capitalists in the past, and they have greater progressiveness. The basic task of our association is to widely organize industrial and commercial business owners and make them an important part of the people's democratic united front. In the future, we must absorb a large number of activists from small and medium industrial and commercial business owners. Because only by relying on them to unite the broad masses of small and medium industrial and commercial business owners can our association become a truly mass-based political group, consolidating and expanding the united front of the industrial and commercial circles.
    This is a great stage of development in our association's organizational line. May all our comrades work together to strive to complete this historic task!

    为向中小工商业者发展组织的决定（摘要）
    民主建国会常务委员会最近通过“为向中小工商业者发展组织的决定”。摘要如下：
    一年多来，本会组织工作是有成绩的，分会由四个发展到二十二个，会员增加了五倍多。但是本会过去在中小工商业者方面发展会员这一工作做得还是十分不够。现在总会为了贯彻这一发展组织的方针，特再决定今后发展会员，应以中小工商业者为主要对象。
    理由是：一、本会当前的政治任务是组织广大的工商业者普遍参加抗美援朝爱国运动。在各地区工商界中，中小工商业者在数量上总是占绝对的多数，过去我们在发展组织方面对于中小工商业者未曾加以充分的重视，为着更好地完成本会的政治任务，应和有关方面密切配合，积极组织和推动广大的中小工商业者，参加各种爱国运动。
    二、在今天全国工商业中，中小工商业占有很大的比重。土地改革完成以后，广大的中小工商业者有了发展前途。本会必须帮助他们组织起来，改善经营方式，以集体的力量，来解决经营和技术上的各种具体问题，根据分工合作的原则，在国营经济领导之下，为新民主主义经济建设而发挥巨大的力量。
    三、在目前全国各地严厉镇压反革命运动中，为了彻底肃清反革命分子，本会必须把中小工商业者更广泛地组织起来，依靠群众力量，大胆的检举反革命分子，以巩固人民民主专政。
    四、就工商界本身来说，中小工商业者，过去是受帝国主义、封建势力、和官僚资产阶级压迫最深的，他们有较大的进步性。本会的基本任务是要把工商业者广泛地组织起来，使成为人民民主统一战线重要的一环。今后就必须把中小工商业者的积极分子大量吸收进来。因为只有依靠他们团结了广大的中小工商业者，才能使本会成为一个真正有群众基础的政治团体，巩固和扩大工商界的统一战线。
    这是本会组织路线上一个伟大的发展阶段，愿我全体同志共同努力，为完成这一历史性的任务而奋斗！
