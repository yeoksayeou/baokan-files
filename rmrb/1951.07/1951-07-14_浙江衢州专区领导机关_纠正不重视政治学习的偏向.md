　　Leadership Organs of Quzhou Prefecture, Zhejiang Province Correct the Tendency of Not Emphasizing Political Study
To the Editor:
    The CCP Quzhou Prefectural Committee of Zhejiang Province conducted a political test on some cadres attending the enlarged meeting of the Prefectural Committee on May 15th. The results of the test showed that many county-level leading cadres did not pay enough attention to learning.
    A total of twenty-eight people participated in the test, including sixteen members of the county party committee, nine section-level cadres from the agencies of the Prefectural Committee and Commissioner's Office, and three other county-level cadres. The test results showed that eighteen people failed, and two people answered everything wrong. Many comrades did not fully answer important questions such as "Why should the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement be thoroughly popularized?" and "Why should the suppression of counter-revolutionaries be carried out with great fanfare?". Some comrades even answered completely wrong.
    This is a problem that deserves attention. Currently, Party organizations and governments in various places are leading the people of the whole country in carrying out movements such as resisting the United States and aiding Korea and various production and construction works. However, in places like our Quzhou Prefecture, many leading cadres in the counties have insufficient or even incorrect understanding of these tasks, which will prevent us from carrying out our work well. The erroneous idea that "you can work without studying" still exists among many cadres. Because they did not study seriously, there has been a serious phenomenon of indiscriminate propaganda to the masses.
    The CCP Quzhou Prefectural Committee has begun to pay attention to this situation and is studying specific methods to urge cadres to carry out political studies conscientiously, so as to improve their political and ideological level and do a good job.

### 浙江衢州专区领导机关  纠正不重视政治学习的偏向

　　浙江衢州专区领导机关  纠正不重视政治学习的偏向编辑同志：
    中共浙江省衢州地委会在五月十五日曾对参加地委扩大会议的一部分干部进行了一次政治测验。测验结果说明：很多县级领导干部对学习是极不重视的。
    参加这次测验的共二十八人，其中县委委员十六人，地委专署机关科长级干部九人，其他县级干部三人。测验结果，不及格者达十八人，有两人竟全部答错了。许多同志对“为什么要深入普及抗美援朝运动？”“镇压反革命为什么要大张旗鼓？”等重要问题也答不完全，个别同志甚至完全答错了。
    这是一个值得重视的问题。当前我们各地党组织和政府正领导着全国人民进行着抗美援朝等运动和各项生产建设工作。但像我们衢州专区，有许多县的领导干部，竟对这些工作认识不足甚或认识错误，这就会使我们的工作不能很好地开展。在很多干部中还存在“不学习也能工作”的错误思想。由于没有认真学习，因之产生了向群众胡乱宣传的严重现象。
    中共衢州地委会对这个情况已开始重视，并研究具体办法，来督促干部认真进行政治学习，为提高政治思想水平、搞好工作而努力。
