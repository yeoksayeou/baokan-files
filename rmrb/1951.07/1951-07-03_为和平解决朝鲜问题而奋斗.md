On June 30th, General Matthew Ridgway, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces in Korea, issued a statement indicating his willingness to accept the proposal made by Soviet Representative to the United Nations, Malik, for the warring parties in Korea to negotiate a ceasefire and armistice, and prepared to hold armistice talks. On July 1st, General Kim Il-sung, Commander-in-Chief of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, jointly issued a statement endorsing the holding of armistice talks with Ridgway. Indeed, a military armistice is only the first step towards a peaceful resolution of the Korean problem. However, if the U.S. government and the governments of other countries participating in the Korean War have the sincerity to end the Korean War, enabling the Korean armistice talks to be held and successfully complete their task, then the Korean armistice talks will be a significant step towards a peaceful resolution of the Korean problem. A peaceful resolution of the Korean problem is what the Korean people, the Chinese people, the Soviet people, the Asian people, and peace-loving people of all countries have consistently demanded and continuously striven for.

Since the outbreak of the Korean War, the Chinese people and the Central People's Government have repeatedly put forward proposals for a peaceful resolution of the Korean problem. In mid-July of last year, the Chinese people expressed their enthusiastic support for the proposals made by Stalin and Nehru regarding a peaceful resolution of the Korean problem. Subsequently, the Chinese people repeatedly expressed their desire for a peaceful resolution of the Korean problem. However, the U.S. government disregarded the world's people's desire for peace, ignored the repeated warnings of the Chinese people, and stubbornly ordered its invading forces to cross the 38th parallel, advancing rapidly and aggressively towards the Yalu and Tumen Rivers on China's border. The Chinese people, of course, could not ignore this serious situation that directly threatened our national security. Therefore, our people rose up to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, forming their own volunteer forces to help the Korean People's Army resist the aggression of the United States and other accomplice countries, thereby aiding our neighbor and protecting ourselves. However, as stated in the joint declaration of various democratic parties in our country on November 4th of last year: "The Chinese people are peace-loving. We have always wanted peace in the past, and we will always want peace in the future. We want peace for China, we want peace for Asia, and we want lasting peace for the entire world and all of humanity." The purpose of the Chinese People's Volunteers participating in the anti-aggression war in Korea is to seek a peaceful resolution of the Korean problem. Therefore, even after this, the Chinese people still advocated resolving the Korean problem through peaceful means and repeatedly expressed their support for reasonable proposals from other countries regarding a peaceful resolution of the Korean problem. However, the U.S. government still harbored illusions of relying on its military force to conquer all of Korea and further threaten Northeast China, thus causing all these efforts towards a peaceful resolution of the Korean problem to fail. Only until recently, due to the continuous and courageous resistance of the Chinese and Korean peoples, which inflicted serious blows on the U.S. military, and the widespread demands for peace from the people of the world, including the American people, which placed increasing difficulties on the U.S. ruling clique, did the U.S. government begin to realize that the Chinese and Korean peoples could not be insulted and that conquering all of Korea was difficult and dangerous. Therefore, for the first time, they expressed their willingness to consider accepting Malik's reasonable peace proposal regarding negotiating a ceasefire and armistice.

The Chinese people fully support Malik's proposal and are willing to work for its realization. Malik said: "The Soviet people believe that the cause of maintaining peace is possible. The armed conflict in Korea – currently the most acute problem – can also be resolved. To achieve this, all parties must have the will to peacefully resolve the Korean problem. The Soviet people believe that the first step is that the warring parties should negotiate a ceasefire and armistice, and both sides should withdraw their troops from the 38th parallel." There is no doubt that as the first step towards a peaceful resolution of the Korean problem, Malik's proposal is fair and reasonable. The entire history of the Korean War up to now confirms the consistent peaceful aspirations of the Chinese and Korean peoples. Based on this consistent peaceful aspiration, the Commander-in-Chief of the Korean People's Army and the Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers responded to Ridgway's proposal to begin armistice talks and quite reasonably suggested that the talks be held in Kaesong, located on the 38th parallel, with the time of the talks set for July 10th to 15th. Since this armistice uses the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line, the most suitable location for the armistice talks would naturally be Kaesong, located on the 38th parallel and once the ancient capital of Korea. Considering the state of transportation in Korea after the war's destruction, as well as the need for appropriate preparations for the armistice talks, holding the talks between July 10th and 15th should be considered very prompt. The question now is whether the U.S. government and the other governments participating in the Korean War also have the same sincere desire as we do to end the bloodshed in Korea? This cannot be judged by empty words but only by facts. Although the armistice talks are strictly military in nature, they will inevitably involve several important issues such as the specific arrangements for the ceasefire and the determination of demilitarized zones. The handling of these issues will be a concrete test of the sincerity of the U.S. government and certain other governments in ending the bloodshed in Korea.

The people of the world are eagerly demanding that a ceasefire and armistice be achieved in Korea on a fair and reasonable basis as the first step in resolving the "most acute problem at present" in the world, thereby opening the road to a peaceful resolution of other problems in the Far East. The Chinese people are peace-loving and have been fighting for a peaceful resolution of the Korean problem. Now that the Korean armistice, as the first step towards a peaceful resolution of the Korean problem, has become possible, let us first seriously strive to achieve this step of the armistice.

Of course, it is necessary to pay serious attention to the fact that a ceasefire and armistice are not yet a reality; the current reality is still war. Whether a ceasefire and armistice can be achieved depends on the negotiations between the representatives of both sides. Before a ceasefire and armistice are truly achieved, all Chinese and Korean troops fighting on the Korean front must be on high alert, preventing possible sneak attacks by the enemy. This is extremely important and must not be relaxed in the slightest. All work to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea in the rear and throughout the country must also not be slackened in the slightest before a ceasefire and armistice are truly achieved. Even after the armistice is achieved, the construction of national defense is still very important. We must have a strong national defense force to effectively oppose possible conspiracies and aggressions by imperialism in the future. This is the iron will of the people of the whole country, and there is no doubt about it.

### 为和平解决朝鲜问题而奋斗

　　为和平解决朝鲜问题而奋斗
    六月三十日，朝鲜联合国军总司令李奇微将军发表声明，表示愿意接受苏联驻联合国代表马立克提出的由朝鲜交战双方谈判停火与休战的提议，并准备举行停战谈判。七月一日，朝鲜人民军总司令金日成将军和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军联合发表声明，赞成与李奇微举行停战谈判。诚然，军事上的停战只是和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步，但如美国政府及其他参加朝鲜战争的各国政府确有停止朝鲜战争的诚意，使朝鲜的停战谈判得以举行并顺利完成其任务；那么，朝鲜的停战谈判将是走向和平解决朝鲜问题的重大的一步，而和平解决朝鲜问题则是朝鲜人民、中国人民、苏联人民、亚洲人民和世界各国爱好和平的人民所一贯要求，并为之不断奋斗的。
    从朝鲜战争爆发以来，中国人民和中央人民政府就再三提出和平解决朝鲜问题的主张。去年七月中旬，中国人民对于斯大林和尼赫鲁关于和平解决朝鲜问题的提议，表示了热烈的支持。在这以后，中国人民又多次表示了自己的和平解决朝鲜问题的愿望。但美国政府无视世界人民的和平愿望，不顾中国人民一再的警告，一意孤行，命令他的侵略军队越过三八线，长驱直入，向中国边境线的鸭绿江和图们江凶恶地进攻。对于这种直接威胁我国安全的严重形势，中国人民当然不能置之不理。于是我国人民纷纷起而抗美援朝，组成自己的志愿部队，帮助朝鲜人民军抵抗美国及其他帮凶国家的侵略，借以援助邻人和保卫自己。但正如去年十一月四日我国各民主党派联合宣言所说：“中国人民是酷爱和平的。我们以前一向要和平，我们今后永远要和平。我们要中国的和平，我们要亚洲的和平，我们要全世界全人类的持久和平。”中国人民志愿军参加朝鲜的反侵略战争，其目的就在于求得朝鲜问题的和平解决。所以即在此后，中国人民仍然主张以和平方式解决朝鲜问题，并曾不止一次地表示支持其它国家关于和平解决朝鲜问题的合理建议。而美国政府却依然幻想依靠它的武力来征服全部朝鲜，进而威胁我国东北，因此，使所有这些关于和平解决朝鲜问题的努力归于失败。只是到了不久以前，由于中朝两国人民的再接再厉的英勇抗战，给与美国军队以严重的打击，世界人民包括美国人民在内的普遍和平要求给与美国统治集团以日益加深的困难，美国政府才开始认识到中朝人民的不可侮和征服全朝鲜的困难与危险，因此，才第一次地表示愿意考虑接受马立克关于谈判停火与休战的合理的和平建议。
    中国人民完全支持马立克的建议，并愿为其实现而努力。马立克说：“苏联人民认为，维护和平事业是可能的。朝鲜的武装冲突——目前最尖锐的问题——也是能够解决的。而要做到这一点，就必须各方有和平解决朝鲜问题的意愿。苏联人民认为，第一个步骤是交战双方应该谈判停火与休战，而双方把军队撤离三八线。”毫无疑问，作为和平解决朝鲜问题的第一个步骤，马立克的提议是公平而又合理的。朝鲜战争截至现在为止的全部历史事实，证实了中朝两国人民一贯的和平愿望。朝鲜人民军总司令和中国人民志愿军司令员根据这一贯的和平愿望答复了李奇微关于开始停战谈判的建议，并完全合理地建议谈判的地点在三八线上的开城举行，谈判的时间定为七月十日至十五日。由于这一次的停战是以三八线为军事分界线，停战谈判的地点自然以位于三八线上并曾为朝鲜的古都的开城为最适宜。考虑到经过战争破坏后的朝鲜的交通情况、以及停战谈判必须有适当的准备，在七月十日至十五日举行谈判应该说是很迅速的。现在的问题是，美国政府及其他参加朝鲜战争的政府是不是也和我们一样具有结束朝鲜境内流血冲突的真诚愿望呢？这不能由空话而只能由事实来判断。停战谈判虽是一个严格军事性质的谈判，它势必牵涉到停火的具体布置，非武装地带的确定等若干重要的问题，这些问题的处理，都将是对美国政府及其他若干政府有无结束朝鲜流血冲突的诚意的具体考验。
    全世界人民热烈要求在公平合理的基础上，首先实现朝鲜境内的停火与休战，作为解决世界上“目前最尖锐的问题”的第一步，并由此而打开和平解决远东其他问题的道路。中国人民是爱好和平的，并且一直为朝鲜问题的和平解决而斗争。现在，作为和平解决朝鲜问题第一步的朝鲜的停战既已有了可能；那么，就让我们首先为实现停战的这一个步骤而严肃地奋斗吧。
    当然必须严重地注意：停火和停战目前还不是事实，目前的事实还是战争。停火和停战是否能实现，决定于双方代表的谈判。在停火和停战真正实现以前，在朝鲜前线作战的一切中朝军队必须严阵以待，防止敌人的可能的乘机袭击，这一点是极端重要的，决不能松懈。在后方在全国的一切抗美援朝工作，在停火和停战真正实现以前，同样不能有丝毫的松懈。即在停战实现以后，国防的建设还是十分重要的。我们必须有强大的国防力量才能有力地反对帝国主义在今后的可能的阴谋侵略，这是全国人民的钢铁一样的意志，这是毫无疑义的。
