　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 30th: Japanese police are intensifying their persecution measures against the Japanese Communist Party and progressive elements. The headquarters of the three National Police Districts (equivalent to the three military districts in pre-war Japan) in Tokyo, Osaka, and Fukuoka simultaneously issued requests to the autonomous police and local Special Investigation Bureaus within their respective districts on the 23rd, asking for assistance from the National Police in "suppressing" the Japanese Communist Party and progressive elements during the "Japanese Communist Party Special Investigation Week." During this "Investigation Week," local officials will be mobilized to investigate vehicles and ships, and monitor the residences of Japanese Communist Party members, bustling streets, theaters, shrines, etc. At the same time, they will also investigate the distribution and delivery of progressive newspapers and the activities of Japanese Communist Party members and progressive elements. In addition, they will collect information about the illegally "purged" Tokuda Kyuichi and other eight members of the Japanese Communist Party Central Committee, attempting to continue to search for them.
　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, 29th (via TASS): According to the Compass newspaper, the heads of the Special Investigation Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Justice have arrived in the United States to study the American experience in fighting "groups conspiring to subvert the country." These people include Yoshikawa Mitsusada, the director of the Special Investigation Bureau. According to the newspaper, his position is equivalent to that of the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (American secret service).
　　The newspaper said that the Special Investigation Bureau, currently under the Ministry of Justice, inherited the "Security Bureau" of the former Japanese Ministry of Home Affairs, and almost half of its employees are former employees of Japanese secret service agencies.
　　The Compass newspaper pointed out that due to the indictments by this Special Investigation Bureau and the Japanese police, the Japanese Communist Party has been increasingly prohibited from public activities in recent years, progressive labor unions have been dissolved, hundreds of activists have been detained under the charge of so-called resistance to the occupying authorities and anti-American activities, and more than 1,700 kinds of progressive newspapers and magazines have been banned.
　　The Japanese secret service chiefs visited the Supreme Court building, where, as everyone knows, the leaders of the American Communist Party were tried.

　　日警在东京等处进行搜查
　  加紧迫害日共及进步分子
    【新华社三十日讯】东京消息：日本警察正加紧对日本共产党与进步分子的迫害措施。东京、大阪、福冈三个国家警察管区（相当于战前日本三个军管区）的本部，于二十三日同时向各该管区内的自治警察与地方特别审查局提出要求，协助国家警察在“日共特别搜查周”内，“取缔”日共和进步分子。在这个“搜查周”内，要动员各地负责官员，调查车辆和轮船，并对日共党员的住宅、繁华街道、剧场、神社等进行监视。同时还要调查进步报刊的发行与投递的情形以及日共党员和进步分子的活动情况。此外，并将搜集有关被非法“整肃”的德田球一等八名日共中央委员的情报，企图继续搜捕他们。
    【新华社三十日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十九日讯：指南针日报消息，日本法务府特别审查局的首脑们已抵美国，研究美国和“阴谋颠覆国家的团体”斗争的经验。这些人里面包括特别审查局局长吉河光贞。据该报说，他的地位与联邦调查局（美国特务机关）局长的地位相等。
    报纸说：目前属于法务府的特别审查局，继承了前日本内务省的“警保局”，几乎有一半的职员都是以前日本特务机关的职员。
    指南针日报指出：由于这个特别审查局与日本警察的检举，最近数年内日本共产党日益被禁止公开活动，进步的工会被解散，数百活动分子以所谓反抗占领当局与反美活动的罪名而被拘禁，一千七百余种进步报纸与杂志被禁。
    日本的特务头子们曾往最高法院大厦参观，大家知道，美国共产党的领袖们曾在那里受审讯。
