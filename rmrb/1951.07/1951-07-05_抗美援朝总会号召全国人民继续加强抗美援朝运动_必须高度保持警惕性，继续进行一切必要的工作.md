　　The Chinese People's Resist-America Aid-Korea General Association Calls on the People of the Whole Country
    To Continue to Strengthen the Resist-America Aid-Korea Movement
    Must Maintain a High Degree of Vigilance and Continue to Carry Out All Necessary Work
    [Report from this newspaper] The Chinese People's Resist-America Aid-Korea General Association issued a notice on July 4th. The full text of the notice is as follows:
    The Chinese people's vigorous movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country, and the victorious battles of the brave soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army on the anti-aggression front have dealt a heavy blow to the American aggressors, forcing them to admit that "the Korean War is a bottomless pit," thus creating the possibility of a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.
    Now the American side has accepted the Soviet Union's representative to the United Nations, Malik's, June 23rd proposal for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and has also accepted the time and location for ceasefire negotiations proposed by Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai, preparing to hold negotiations at Kaesong on the 38th parallel in Korea from July 10th to 15th.
    We, the Chinese people, have always advocated a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. It is precisely in order to realize this proposition that we resolutely resist America and aid Korea. However, although a ceasefire in Korea is now possible, it has not yet become a reality; even if a ceasefire becomes a reality, it is only the first step towards a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Therefore, we must maintain a high degree of vigilance regarding the future of the Korean issue, and we must continue to carry out all necessary work.
    Compatriots! Today, the war in Korea has not stopped, the Korean issue has not been resolved, and our sacred task of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country has not been completed. We call on the brave soldiers fighting on the front lines in Korea to be on high alert and guard against enemy sneak attacks. We call on the people of the whole country to make persistent efforts, continue to strengthen the movement to resist America and aid Korea, and not to slack off in the slightest. Only a strong military force and an indomitable people's will can strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Moreover, we must remember that the American aggressors are still occupying our Taiwan, still preparing to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan, and still rearming Japan. Therefore, even after the Korean issue is peacefully resolved, the people of our country must still continue to defend our great motherland, oppose American aggression, and defend peace in the Far East and world peace, and wage unremitting struggles. Therefore, this association requests all general branches and branches across the country to intensify their efforts, and asks all compatriots to continue to struggle to complete the following urgent tasks:
    1. Continue to work hard to develop the production increase and donation movement. Since this association issued the call to launch a production increase and donation movement on June 1st, preliminary statistics show that donations of aircraft have reached 1,970 in various regions. In addition, there are some cannons and tanks. This large-scale production increase and donation movement has not only greatly strengthened the strength of resisting America, aiding Korea, and national defense, but also greatly increased the production and income of all sectors of industry, agriculture, and commerce. This is a great force for defeating the enemy. However, the development of the donation movement is still very uneven, and many places have not yet launched it. In order to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, strengthen national defense, and liberate Taiwan, we should make persistent efforts, continue to work hard, and strive for the universal realization of the production increase and donation plan throughout the country.
    2. Conscientiously give preferential treatment to the families of all military personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the People's Liberation Army and the families of revolutionary martyrs. We call on all cities and villages across the country to conduct a comprehensive and practical inspection of the situation of preferential treatment and compensation work within one week before and after this year's "August 1st" Army Day of the People's Liberation Army, and launch a mass movement of preferential treatment.
    3. Continue to mobilize young students to sign up to join military cadre schools and complete the enrollment plan of military cadre schools in order to rapidly strengthen our national defense construction.
    4. Continue to deepen the patriotic pact movement. The establishment of patriotic pacts is a long-term task for the people of the whole country; we request that people from all walks of life in all parts of the country further popularize and deepen the patriotic pact movement, increase the number of people participating in the establishment of patriotic pacts as much as possible, make the content of the patriotic pacts more specific, and conduct a comprehensive inspection of this work in July, and then improve and promote this work based on the inspection results. At the same time, we request that the people of the whole country continue to popularize patriotic propaganda and education, enhance and consolidate the patriotic enthusiasm of the people of the whole country, and implement the patriotic production plan.
    5. Continue to help the visiting groups to Korea and the representatives of the Volunteer Army to complete the propaganda work in various parts of the country according to the original plan.
                                    Chinese People's Resist-America Aid-Korea General Association

### 抗美援朝总会号召全国人民继续加强抗美援朝运动  必须高度保持警惕性，继续进行一切必要的工作

　　抗美援朝总会号召全国人民
    继续加强抗美援朝运动
    必须高度保持警惕性，继续进行一切必要的工作
    【本报讯】中国人民抗美援朝总会于七月四日发出通知，通知全文如下：
    中国人民轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝保家卫国的运动，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的勇士们在反侵略前线的胜利战斗，给了美国侵略者以沉重的打击，使他们不能不承认“朝鲜战争是无底洞”，因而产生了和平解决朝鲜问题的可能性。
    现在美国方面已经接受了苏联驻联合国代表马立克六月二十三日关于和平解决朝鲜问题的建议，并且接受了金日成、彭德怀两将军所提出的关于举行停战谈判的时间和地点，准备于七月十日至十五日在朝鲜三八线上的开城举行谈判。
    我们中国人民是历来主张和平解决朝鲜问题的。正是为了实现这个主张，我们才坚决地抗美援朝。但是目前朝鲜停战虽然有了可能性，还没有成为事实；即使停战成为事实，也还只是和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步。因此，对于朝鲜问题的前途，我们还必须保持高度的警惕性，并且必须继续进行一切必要的工作。
    同胞们！今天朝鲜的战争还没有停止，朝鲜问题还没有解决，我们抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣任务还没有完成。我们号召在朝鲜前线作战的勇士们，务必严阵以待，谨防敌人乘机袭击。我们号召全国人民务必再接再厉，继续加强抗美援朝运动，不能有丝毫的松懈。只有强大的军事力量和不屈不挠的人民意志，才能争取朝鲜问题的和平解决。而且我们要记着：美国侵略者还在侵占着我国台湾，还在准备着单独对日媾和，还在重新武装着日本，因此，即在朝鲜问题和平解决以后，我国人民也仍然必须继续为保卫我们伟大的祖国，为反对美国侵略，为保卫远东和平和世界和平，而进行坚持不懈的斗争。因此，本会要求全国各总分会各分会一致加紧努力工作，要求全国同胞一致继续奋斗，以完成下列的迫切任务：
    一、继续努力开展增产捐献运动。自本会六月一日号召开展增产捐献运动以来，初步统计各地捐献飞机已达一千九百七十架，此外，还有一些大炮和坦克，这一规模巨大的增产捐献运动，不但大大地加强了抗美援朝和国防的实力，而且同时使工农商各界大大地增加了生产和收入，这是打败敌人的伟大力量。但是捐献运动的发展还很不平衡，许多地方至今还没有开展。为了争取朝鲜问题的和平解决，增强国防力量，解放台湾，我们应该再接再厉，继续努力，为在全国普遍实现增产捐献的计划而奋斗。
    二、认真优待人民志愿军和人民解放军一切军人家属和革命烈士家属。我们号召全国所有的城市和乡村，在今年“八一”人民解放军建军节之前后各一个星期内，对优待和抚恤工作状况，作一次普遍的切实的检查，开展群众性的优抚运动。
    三、继续动员青年学生报名参加军事干部学校，完成军事干部学校的招生计划，以便迅速加强我们的国防建设。
    四、继续深入开展爱国公约运动。订立爱国公约是全国人民的长时期的任务；我们要求全国各地各界人民进一步普及和深入爱国公约运动，使参加订立爱国公约者的人数尽量增多，爱国公约的内容更加具体，并且在七月份内把这一工作普遍检查一次，然后根据检查结果，对这一工作加以改进和推广。同时，我们要求全国人民继续普及爱国主义的宣传教育，提高与巩固全国人民的爱国热情，贯彻执行爱国生产计划。
    五、继续帮助赴朝慰问团和志愿军代表按照原定计划完成在全国各地的宣传工作。
                                    中国人民抗美援朝总会
                                          一九五一年七月四日
