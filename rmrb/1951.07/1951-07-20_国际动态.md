    Royal Fascists are the Real National Traitors
    In Greece, Seremosas, a patriotic personage who was twice sentenced to death, recently wrote to the Greek Court of Appeal, opposing the request for clemency made by his defense lawyer. He asked not for clemency for himself, but for a fair trial.
    A patriotic personage is innocent, why should he ask for clemency? That group of treasonous Royal Fascists are the real national traitors, and the Greek people will never forgive them.
　　
    Norwegian People Oppose "Americanization"
    The Norwegian Gerhardsen government intends to grant American imperialism the right to exploit Norway's northern natural resources, and the Norwegian people are very angry. The Narvik local newspaper "Northern Workers' Daily" published an article vehemently opposing the "Americanization" of northern Norway. The newspaper said: "The question is definitely not, as Mr. Gerhardsen said when defending his trick, that it can provide food for 10,000 people. Developing the natural resources of northern Norway is enough to employ 100,000 people. If the Gerhardsen government sincerely wants to do something for the people of northern Norway, then with a relatively small investment, it can provide millions of people with permanent, well-paid jobs that can guarantee them a reasonably good life."
    "Can provide food for 10,000 people" is just an excuse for the Gerhardsen government to sell out national interests. The Norwegian people will never be deceived by such lies.
　　
    Rogue Behavior of American Soldiers
    Recently, the rogue behavior of American soldiers in Tokyo has become increasingly unrestrained. Even Japanese bourgeois newspapers have had to report these facts. The Jiji Shinpo recently reported that American soldiers beat and robbed a Japanese employee. The Mainichi Shimbun reported two incidents of American soldiers beating taxi drivers in Tokyo. The behavior of American soldiers in Osaka is equally unrestrained. According to the Osaka Shimbun, in mid-June, American soldiers in Osaka robbed taxi drivers of their belongings and beat women.
    The Japanese people will turn their resentment into action against these shameless acts of American thugs.

　保皇法西斯分子才是民族罪人
    在希腊，两次被判死刑的爱国志士塞尔莫萨斯最近致函希腊上诉法院，反对辩护律师所提出的宽恕的请求，他要求的不是宽恕他，而是作公正的审判。
    爱国志士是无罪的，他为什么要求宽恕？那群卖国的保皇法西斯分子才是民族罪人，希腊人民永远也不会宽恕他们。
　挪威人民反对“美国化”
    挪威基哈德森政府意图使美帝国主义获得挪威北部天然资源的开采权，挪威人民非常愤怒。那尔维克地方的《北方工人日报》著文激烈地反对挪威北部“美国化”。这个报纸说：“问题决不是如基哈德森先生替他的诡计辩护时所说的那样，可以使一万人有饭吃。开发挪威北部的天然富源，就足以使十万人就业。如果基哈德森政府真心要为挪威北方人民做点事情，那么，只要用比较少的投资，就可以使千千万万人获得永久的、有报酬的、足以保障他们能过一种相当好的生活的职业了。”
    “可以使一万人有饭吃”，只是基哈德森政府出卖国家利益的借口，挪威人民决不致被这样的谎言所迷惑的。
　美国兵士的流氓行径
    近来，美国兵士的流氓行为在东京已经越来越放肆了。甚至日本的资产阶级报纸也不得不报道这些事实。时事新报不久前报道，美国兵士殴打并抢劫了一个日本职员。每日新闻报道了美国兵士在东京殴打出租汽车司机的两件事情。大阪美国兵士的行为也有同样放肆。据大阪新闻说，在六月中旬，大阪的美国兵士抢劫了出租汽车司机的财物，并殴打妇女。
    对于这些美国流氓的无耻行为，日本人民是会将愤恨变成行动的。
