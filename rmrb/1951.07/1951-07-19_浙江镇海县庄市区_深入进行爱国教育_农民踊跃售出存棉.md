　　Zhejiang Zhenhai County, Zhuangshi District

　　Thorough Patriotic Education

　　Farmers Enthusiastically Sell Stored Cotton

　　Leading cadres in Zhuangshi District, Zhenhai County, Zhejiang Province, have attached great importance to the work of selling and storing cotton, and have conducted thorough patriotic education among the masses. After receiving education, cotton farmers enthusiastically sold their stored cotton to the state.

　　After receiving instructions from higher authorities regarding the launch of cotton storage and purchasing, the Secretary of the Zhuangshi District Party Committee and the Deputy District Head, along with other responsible cadres, braved heavy rain on June 14th to deploy this work in Cotton Sea Township. They first went deep into the masses, conducted individual interviews, and held small-scale symposiums to understand that cotton farmers still had a considerable amount of stored cotton. However, due to various ideological concerns and a lack of patriotic thought, many were unwilling to sell immediately. For example, some cotton farmers said, "We don't need the money right now, it won't be too late to sell after the new grain is harvested." Some were afraid of being reclassified as a higher class if they sold a lot of cotton at once, and were afraid that others would borrow money from them. Some were afraid of being seen selling cotton, saying, "Please set up the cotton collection point at Guisi Bridge, we will carry it there to sell in the middle of the night."

　　Based on the ideological situation of the masses, district cadres conducted in-depth patriotic education among the masses, making farmers realize that if it weren't for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao leading the Chinese people to defeat the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and establishing a new China, and the People's Government implementing various policies to protect the interests of cotton farmers, farmers would not have today's good life, and would not be able to store cotton. For example, before liberation, the Chiang bandit gang built an airport in the township, leveled 800 mu of cotton fields, and forced farmers to demolish more than 200 houses; but now, under the leadership of the People's Government, more than 600 mu of cotton fields have been expanded. In the past, American cotton flooded the market, and cotton prices were not guaranteed; now, prices are stable, and the government has stipulated cotton-grain price ratios, and provides loans for fertilizer and seeds. When there was a drought, the People's Government led the dredging of 13 li of rivers and used two machines to pump water. After comparison, the cotton farmers' awareness improved. Cotton farmer Fang Arui said, "If there is not enough cotton, factories will shut down. As long as everyone is of one mind, little things add up, grains of sand form a pagoda, selling cotton to the state will allow factories to start, and we will have cheap and good-looking cloth to buy, which is good for both the country and ourselves." The cadres also carried out education on the worker-peasant alliance through the fact that workers installed machines to pump water and help local farmers fight drought. Everyone said: "If it weren't for the worker brothers helping us, our cotton would have died from drought long ago. Now that the factories are shut down, how can we not help them?" The cadres also publicized the policies of developing agricultural production and free lending. Finally, they also checked the patriotic covenants. Yang Daode said: "When I signed the patriotic covenant, I said: I want to listen to Chairman Mao's words; now that the government calls on us to sell and store cotton, we must respond with practical actions!"

　　After initially gaining experience by going deep into one village, the district and village cadres convened a meeting of village representatives to conduct ideological mobilization. After the village representatives returned, they separately convened women's meetings, farmers' association member meetings, Communist Youth League member meetings, and villagers' meetings to check the patriotic covenants, and publicized patriotic cotton selling and storage, forming a vigorous patriotic cotton selling and storage movement throughout the township. In a very short time, the township has sold more than 10,000 catties of cotton.

　　浙江镇海县庄市区
    深入进行爱国教育
    农民踊跃售出存棉
    浙江省镇海县庄市区领导干部十分重视售棉储棉工作，向群众进行了深入的爱国售棉储棉教育。棉农受到教育后踊跃将存棉卖给国家。
    中共庄市区区委书记和副区长等负责干部接到上级关于开展储棉购棉的指示后，就在六月十四日冒大雨到棉海乡布置这一工作。他们首先深入群众，进行个别访问，召开小型座谈会，了解到棉农尚有不少存棉；但因棉农存在各种思想顾虑，缺乏爱国思想，多不愿立即出售。如有的棉农说：“现在又不等钱用，等新谷登场再卖也不迟。”有的怕因一下出售很多棉花而被提高阶级成份，怕别人向他借贷。有的怕卖棉花被别人看见，说：“请政府把收棉处设在贵驷桥，我们三更半夜挑去卖。”
    根据群众的思想情况，区干部向群众深入进行爱国主义的教育，使农民认识到，如果不是共产党和毛主席领导中国人民打跑蒋介石匪帮，建立了新中国，和人民政府实施了各项保护棉农利益的政策，农民就不可能有今天的好光景，就不可能存下棉花。如解放前蒋匪帮曾在该乡造飞机场，平了八百亩棉田，强迫农民拆毁房屋二百多间；但是现在在人民政府的领导下，却扩大了六百多亩棉田。过去美国棉花充斥市场，棉价没有保证；现在物价稳定，政府又规定棉粮比价，贷肥料，贷种籽。天一旱，人民政府就领导疏通河道十三里，并用两部机器打水。经过对比以后，棉农觉悟提高了。棉农方阿瑞说：“棉花不够，工厂停工，只要大家齐心，积少成多，聚沙成塔，把棉花卖给国家，工厂开工，我们有又便宜又好看的布买，对国家对自己都好。”干部们还通过工人装机器打水帮助当地农民抗旱的事，进行工农联盟的教育。大家都说：“没有工人兄弟帮我们一把，我们棉花早就旱死了。今天工厂停工，我们怎么能不援助他们？”干部们还宣传了发展农业生产和自由借贷的政策。最后还检查了爱国公约。杨道德说：“我订爱国公约时说：要听毛主席的话；现在政府号召我们售棉储棉，我们就要用实际行动来响应！”
    区村干部在深入一村初步取得经验后，就召集各村村代表开会，进行思想动员。村代表回去以后，即分别召开妇女会、农会会员会、青年团员会、村民大会等，检查爱国公约，宣传爱国售棉储棉，使全乡形成轰轰烈烈的爱国售棉储棉运动。在很短时间，全乡已售出棉花一万余斤。
