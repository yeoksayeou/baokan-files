Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, 22nd dispatch from TASS: At the World Peace Council Executive Bureau meeting on the 20th, World Peace Council Chairman Joliot-Curie delivered a report on the movement currently underway worldwide to demand that the five major powers conclude a peace pact. Joliot-Curie said: This movement is a struggle to liberate humanity from the oppression of nightmares. The significance of the movement is so great that we must make it victorious. To achieve this great goal, all peace defenders must contribute their strength. We must recognize the full fundamental significance of the Peace Pact Declaration. Peace defenders can only succeed by using correct and concrete evidence to lead those who still stand on the sidelines, those in whom the enemy can sow confusion, onto the path of peace. I am referring to the millions who are still estranged from us; without them, we cannot finally and completely consolidate peace.

Joliot-Curie said: Regardless of the people's views on the causes of the threat of world war, we must help them recognize that the declaration is in line with the effort to ensure that the spirit of peaceful resolution overrides attempts to forcibly decide issues by means of war.

Joliot-Curie emphasized the importance of combining the current struggle for peace with specific demands for stopping the arms race. He said: Experience tells us that the policy of launching an arms race by relying on armies often interrupts negotiations aimed at maintaining peace. This policy often leads to war. Therefore, I feel it is necessary to particularly emphasize that, within the scope of our demand that the five major powers hold meetings to negotiate the conclusion of a peace pact, we attach great importance to the issues related to disarmament, the establishment of supervision over disarmament work, the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction, and thus stopping the arms race. The resolution of the Warsaw World Peace Congress on disarmament, the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction, and the establishment of appropriate controls to supervise the implementation of these measures, most clearly expresses our main ideas. I believe that now is the time to take advantage of the movement in support of the Peace Pact Declaration to emphasize this point. This issue has become increasingly concerning to the broad masses.

Joliot-Curie pointed out: The issues related to the remilitarization of Germany and Japan have caused serious anxiety among the people of the world. These issues can only be properly resolved within the scope of a general resolution of the international situation; and a general resolution of the international situation can be sought in the negotiations of the five major powers.

Speaking about the current armistice negotiations in Korea, Joliot-Curie said: We are very pleased to see that the spirit of peace negotiations has had concrete manifestations and that there is hope for an armistice in the Korean War. The decision to start negotiations is undoubtedly the result of pressure from the people (including the majority of the American people who oppose this bloody slaughter). This important event has brought great hope to many upright people. We must not let these people be deceived, we must maintain these hopes. To achieve this goal, negotiations to end the Vietnam War must be launched; greater efforts must be made to intensify the struggle so that our declaration can be realized. In this way, the spirit of peace negotiations can override the attempt to resolve issues by violence, which would bring disaster.

Joliot-Curie pointed out the difficulties encountered by the World Peace Council delegation when visiting the United Nations headquarters, saying: I believe that the act of the government of the country where the United Nations is located in refusing to issue entry visas has seriously violated the powers of the President of the Security Council and the Secretary-General of the United Nations. This act proves that the United States government has begun to regard the United Nations as an organization subordinate to it.

Joliot-Curie finally suggested: The Executive Bureau must emphasize the need to stop the arms race and stop all measures already implemented or planned to be implemented for rearmament – such as the North Atlantic Treaty and the remilitarization of Japan and Germany – so that the spirit of peace negotiations overrides the spirit of violence; we must do everything possible to effectively expand our movement.

The Executive Bureau meetings on the 20th and 21st discussed Joliot-Curie's report.

　　在世界和平理事会执行局会议上
　  居里报告拥护缔结和平公约运动
    指出：朝鲜停战谈判是人民加压力的结果，必须努力加紧进行斗争，才能实现和平
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社赫尔辛基讯：世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里在二十日世界和平理事会执行局会议上作了关于正在全世界展开的要求五大国缔结和平公约的运动的报告。约里奥—居里说：这个运动就是把人类从梦魔的压迫下解放出来的斗争。运动的意义是如此重大，我们必须使它获得胜利。为要达到这个伟大的目标，一切和平保卫者都必须拿出他们的力量来。我们必须认识到和平公约宣言的全部基本意义。和平保卫者只有用正确和具体的证据把那些迄今仍然站在旁边的人们，把那些敌人能够在其中散播混乱的人们引到和平的道路上来，他们才能够成功。我所指的是千百万仍然和我们疏远的人们，没有他们，我们就不能最后和万全地巩固和平。
    约里奥—居里说：不管人民对于引起世界战争威胁的原因的看法如何，我们必须帮助他们认识宣言是和这样的努力符合的，就是：使和平解决的精神压倒以战争方式强行决定问题的企图。
    约里奥—居里着重说明把目前的和平斗争和停止扩张军备运动的具体要求结合起来的重要性。他说：经验告诉我们：凭借军队而发动扩张军备运动的政策，常常使以维护和平为目的的谈判中断。这种政策常常引起战争。因此我觉得必须特别着重地指出：在我们要求五大国举行会议谈判缔结和平公约的范围内，我们极重视的是有关裁减军备、建立对裁减军备工作的监督、禁止大规模毁灭人类的武器从而停止扩张军备运动的问题。华沙世界和平大会关于裁减军备、禁止大规模毁灭人类的武器和建立适当的管制以监督这些措施执行的决议，最明确地表明了我们的主要思想。我认为：现在正是借拥护和平公约宣言运动的机会来强调这一点的时候。这个问题已越来越为广大群众所关心了。
    约里奥—居里指出：与德日两国重新军国主义化有关的问题，引起了全世界人民的严重不安。这些问题只有在国际局势总解决的范围内，才能得到适当的解决；而国际局势的总解决是可以在五大国谈判中求得的。
    约里奥—居里讲到目前在朝鲜进行的停战谈判时说：看见和平谈判的精神已有具体的表现，而且朝鲜战争有了停战的希望，我们很高兴。开始谈判的决定无疑是人民（包括反对这种血腥屠杀的大部分美国人民在内）加压力的结果。这个重要的事件给许多正直的人民带来了很大的希望。我们不能让这些人民受骗，我们必须保持这些希望。为了达到这个目的，必须展开结束越南战争的谈判；必须更加努力加紧进行斗争，以使我们的宣言得以实现。这样，和平谈判的精神就能压倒那种以暴力决定问题并且会带来灾难的企图。
    约里奥—居里指出世界和平理事会代表团访问联合国总部时所遭遇的困难说：我认为，作为联合国所在地的国家的政府拒绝颁发入境签证的行为，已严重地侵犯了安全理事会主席及联合国秘书长的权力。这种行为证明美国政府已开始认为联合国是一个附属于它的组织了。
    约里奥—居里最后建议：执行局必须强调指出制止扩张军备运动及停止一切已经实施或计划实施的整顿军备的措施——例如北大西洋公约和日本、德国重新军国主义化——的必要性，以使和平谈判的精神压倒暴力的精神；必须竭尽全力来有效地扩大我们的运动。
    二十日和二十一日的执行局会议讨论了约里奥—居里的报告。
