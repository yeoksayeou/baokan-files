Since the imperialist element Li Peili arrived in Nanjing at the end of 1946 as the Papal Nuncio to the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek government, he has been colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek government and American imperialism, plotting to be an enemy of the Chinese people and engaging in criminal activities that harmed the Chinese people.

In 1946, Chiang Kai-shek, with the support of American imperialism, launched an unprecedented anti-people civil war and convened the so-called "National Assembly" to formulate a "constitution." It was at this time that Li Peili came to China, and he praised all of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary and traitorous measures. When he "presented his credentials" to Chiang Kai-shek, he called Chiang Kai-shek's anti-communist and traitorous words and deeds "lofty insights." He said to Chiang Kai-shek, "The Catholic people all over the world admire all kinds of grand theories previously expressed by your chairman," "I personally admire Chairman Chiang very much." He praised Chiang Kai-shek's anti-people civil war as "continuing to lead the great cause of national construction" and "moving towards a civilized future." On New Year's Day in 1947, when the war criminal Yu Bin took office as the Catholic Bishop of the Nanjing Diocese, Li Peili publicly praised the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's "constitution" as a "description of progress" in Chinese politics and shamelessly prayed for Chiang Kai-shek: "Asking God to bless Chairman Chiang's health and protect those who cooperate with Chiang." In his first letter to all Chinese bishops on January 6, 1947, he promoted Chiang Kai-shek, saying, "The Chinese nation now has very wise leaders who have escaped unprecedented dangers."

In order to continue to expand the civil war, Chiang Kai-shek created a so-called "refugee petition" farce in 1947, organizing traitors and fleeing landlords from Shandong and northern Jiangsu to "petition" the puppet National Assembly, demanding the "recovery" of the "lost land" of these traitors and landlords. Li Peili actively participated in this conspiracy, hypocritically running to Xiaguan in Nanjing to "comfort the refugees," saying "I wish you all an early end to the disaster in your hometowns so that you can return to your hometowns," encouraging this group of counter-revolutionaries to "return to their hometowns" to oppose the people.

In 1947, Li Peili traveled throughout the provinces south of the Yangtze River, carrying out counter-revolutionary mobilization for imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. He personally gave secret instructions to his bishops, advising them to be loyal to imperialism and its running dog, Chiang Kai-shek. When he arrived in Changsha at the end of March, he blatantly declared to the Catholics in Changsha: "My mission in China is to assist the government in completing the work of national rejuvenation." He called on Catholics to actively assist the Chiang Kai-shek government. In Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, in June of the same year, he told the Catholics: "I especially hope that in the future, we will concentrate our efforts to closely contact the government."

In the second half of 1947, the People's Liberation Army turned to the counter-offensive, and at the same time, land reform was implemented in the liberated areas. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang suffered heavy blows militarily and politically. As a result, this "envoy" became nervous and actively carried out sabotage activities through Yu Bin and other imperialist missionaries, trying to save their fate. When the American war-monger Wedemeyer arrived in Northeast China to "inquire" about the defeat of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, Li Peili immediately sent Yu Bin to Northeast China to organize Catholics and puppet groups to petition Wedemeyer, demanding that American imperialism step up its assistance to Chiang Kai-shek. At the same time, he himself rushed to North China and Northeast China to instigate Catholics to serve the reactionary regime of Chiang Kai-shek. He slandered the democratic and free liberated areas as being "in deep water" and incited Catholics, "whether they are members or non-members, Chinese or foreigners," to "cooperate" to oppose the Communist Party, the People's Liberation Army, and the land reform movement.

However, Li Peili's conspiracies did not achieve their goals, and the Chinese people's war of liberation and land reform movement continued to achieve victories. Li Peili then openly declared war on the Chinese people through his reactionary propaganda tool, the Yishi Weekly. In October 1947, Yishi Weekly published an article openly calling on Catholics to organize a "Catholic Party," saying, "The time has come, and we, with five million Catholics, should rise up to defend ourselves." By December, Yishi Weekly published an article entitled "From Christmas to Suppressing the Rebellion and Saving the Country," saying, "This is about using guns, that is, we must have gun training," further calling on Catholics in the liberated areas to organize armed rebellions. And without admitting it, he confessed: "Religion is not neutral," "Religious neutrality is morbid, it is an epidemic."

On New Year's Day in 1948, Li Peili, while "blessing the New Year," issued orders to Chinese Catholics, asking them to "earnestly give play to our missionary spirit and strength," and "use the truth and justice of the church to assist in China's construction," in order to achieve "building the country through religion."

In the autumn of that year, the People's Liberation Army launched a thunderous offensive, achieving brilliant victories in the Northeast, North China, and Central Plains battlefields. The people in the Chiang-controlled areas also rose up to oppose Chiang Kai-shek's rule, and Li Peili became even more flustered. He hurriedly summoned the international spy Mockler from the United States and sent him to North China to organize a Catholic reactionary secret organization - the Legion of Mary; Li Peili himself took a US military plane and ran to Beijing for the second time, mobilizing Catholics to support the crumbling Chiang Kai-shek government; and launched reactionary telegrams by puppet groups such as the "Catholic Cultural Association" to support Chiang Kai-shek's "clearing of communist spies," arresting and killing a large number of patriotic people.

After the Huaihai Campaign, Chiang Kai-shek's dynasty was fundamentally destroyed. Li Peili concealed his arrogant and domineering counter-revolutionary ferocity, and intensified his sabotage activities through his henchmen. In addition to sending Yu Bin to the United States again to seek assistance, and sending Mockler to southern China to organize the Legion of Mary, he also engaged in a "family defense movement" through his running dogs, mobilizing Catholics to organize counter-revolutionary activities with the family as the core. Li Peili even demanded that Catholics never "change course" even after liberation, bewitching them to "organize ubiquitous militia and guerrillas," and to "unite to respond to changes."

On the eve of the liberation of Nanjing, the American and Chiang elements fled, and Li Peili sent the secretary of the "Embassy," Ge Ligeng, to flee with the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, while he himself remained in Nanjing, attempting to continue his imperialist aggression. But in liberated China, it was no longer possible for Li Peili to continue riding on the heads of the Chinese people and act as a bully. Now the people of the whole country and patriotic Catholics unanimously demand that Li Peili be expelled from China, which is the minimum punishment that the imperialist element Li Peili deserves.

　　黎培里怎样勾结蒋匪帮进行反共反人民活动
    新华社记者  艾长青
    帝国主义分子黎培里，自一九四六年年底以罗马教廷驻蒋介石卖国政府公使的身份来到南京以后，就一直和蒋介石政府、美帝国主义勾结在一起，处心积虑地与中国人民为敌，进行着危害中国人民的罪恶活动。
    一九四六年蒋介石在美帝国主义的支持下，发动了空前规模的反人民内战，并召开所谓“国民大会”，制订“宪法”。正是在这个时候来到中国的黎培里，对于蒋介石的一切反动卖国措施都赞扬不止。当他向蒋介石“呈递国书”时，他把蒋介石反共卖国的言行称之为“见解崇高”。他向蒋介石说：“贵主席前所发表之各种宏论，全球天主教人士莫不钦佩”，“我个人对蒋主席的为人是万分景仰的”。他把蒋介石反人民的内战，誉之为“继续领导建国大业”，“向文明前程迈进”。一九四七年元旦，在战犯于斌就职天主教南京教区主教时，黎培里又公开歌颂蒋匪帮的“宪法”是中国政治“进步的说明”，并无耻地为蒋介石祈祷：“要求天主保佑蒋主席政躬康泰，护佑与蒋合作的人员。”他在一九四七年一月六日第一次给中国全体主教的信中又为蒋介石宣扬说：“中国民族现在有很贤明的领袖，已经逃脱了前所未有的危险境地。”
    蒋介石为了继续扩大内战，曾在一九四七年制造了所谓“难民请愿”的丑剧，把山东、苏北的汉奸、逃亡地主等组织起来向伪国民大会“请愿”，要求“收复”这批汉奸、地主的“失地”。黎培里积极参加了这一阴谋，假惺惺地跑到南京下关去“慰问难民”，说什么“祝福各位家乡灾难早除，俾使各位能返回家乡”，鼓励这批反革命分子“还乡”反对人民。
    一九四七年，黎培里曾走遍了江南各省，为帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮作反革命动员。他亲自对他的主教们授以机密，劝告他们效忠于帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石。他在三月底到达长沙时，即对长沙市的天主教徒赤裸裸地宣称：“本人被派驻中国的使命，是在协助政府完成民族复兴的工作。”他号召教徒积极地协助蒋介石政府。同年六月，他在江西南昌，向教徒们说：“尤望今后集中力量与政府密切联系。”
    一九四七年下半年，人民解放军转入反攻，同时在解放区内实行了土地改革，蒋介石匪帮在军事上、政治上都受到了沉重的打击。于是，这位“公使”便紧张起来，积极地通过于斌及其他帝国主义传教士进行破坏活动，力图挽救他们的命运。当美国战争贩子魏德迈抵达东北，“垂询”蒋匪帮的败局时，黎培里即派遣于斌去东北组织教徒和御用团体向魏德迈请愿，要求美帝国主义加紧援助蒋介石。同时，他自己也连忙赶到华北、东北，煽动天主教徒来为蒋介石的反动政权效命。他污蔑民主自由的解放区“处于水深火热之中”鼓动天主教徒“无论有会籍的，无会籍的中国人、外国人”，都要“合作”起来反对共产党、人民解放军和土地改革运动。
    但是，黎培里的阴谋活动并没有收到功效，中国人民的解放战争和土地改革运动继续不断地取得了胜利。黎培里便通过他的反动宣传工具——益世周刊公开向中国人民宣战。一九四七年十月，益世周刊登出一篇文章，公开号召天主教徒组织“天主教党”，说什么“已届其时矣，我拥有五百万之天主教徒急应起而自卫”。到十二月，益世周刊更发表了一篇《从圣诞节说到戡乱救国》的文章，说“这是要运用枪炮了，也就是非有枪炮的组训不可了”，进一步号召解放区的天主教徒组织武装暴乱。并且不打自招地供认：“宗教无中立”，“宗教上的中立是病态，是疫症”。
    一九四八年元旦，黎培里在“祝福新年”时，又向中国天主教徒发号施令，要他们“切实发挥我们传教精神和力量”，“用教会的真理正义辅助中国的建设事业”，以达成“兴教建国”。
    这年秋天，人民解放军发动了雷霆万钧的攻势，在东北、华北和中原战场，连续获得了辉煌的胜利，在蒋管区的人民也纷纷起而反对蒋介石的统治，于是黎培里更加慌张起来。他急忙从美国召来国际间谍莫克勤，派他去华北组织天主教的反动秘密组织——圣母军；黎培里自己则坐了美国军用机第二次跑到北京，动员天主教徒支持摇摇欲坠的蒋介石政府；并发动“天主教文化协会”等御用团体发表反动通电，拥护蒋介石“清除匪谍”，逮捕和杀害大批爱国志士。
    淮海战役以后，蒋介石的王朝已被根本摧毁。黎培里即掩藏起嚣张跋扈的反革命凶相，而变本加厉地通过其爪牙进行破坏活动。他除了再次派于斌去美求援，以及派莫克勤去华南组织圣母军以外，并通过他的走狗搞什么“家庭保卫运动”，发动天主教徒以家庭为核心组织反革命活动。黎培里更要求天主教徒在解放以后也决不要“改弦易辙”，蛊惑他们“组织遍地义勇军，游击队”，“团结应变”。
    南京解放前夕，美、蒋分子逃跑了，黎培里派了“公使馆”的秘书葛理耕随着蒋匪残余逃走，而他自己却仍然留在南京，企图继续其帝国主义的侵略活动。但是在解放了的中国，黎培里还想继续骑在中国人民头上作威作福，这是再不可能了。现在全国人民和爱国天主教徒一致要求将黎培里逐出中国，这是帝国主义分子黎培里应该得到的起码的惩罚。
