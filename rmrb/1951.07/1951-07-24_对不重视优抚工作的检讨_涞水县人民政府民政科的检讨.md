　　Self-criticism Regarding Neglecting Preferential Treatment Work
　　Self-criticism from the Civil Affairs Section of the Laishui County People's Government

To the Editor:

On May 21st, the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily published criticisms from Comrade Sun Yulan and the Organization Section of a certain division's Political Department regarding our county's Fifth District People's Government's lack of attention to supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to the families of soldiers. After our investigation, it is true that the district did not pay enough attention to the issue of Comrade Sun Yulan's family's preferential treatment. We are also responsible for the poor inspection of the district People's Government's preferential treatment work. In addition to criticizing the Fifth District People's Government and resolving the issue of Comrade Sun Yulan's family's treatment, we will strengthen the leadership of the preferential treatment work in each district and earnestly do this work well as a practical action for resisting America and aiding Korea. We are sending the self-criticism of our county's Fifth District People's Government for publication.

### 对不重视优抚工作的检讨  涞水县人民政府民政科的检讨

　　对不重视优抚工作的检讨
    涞水县人民政府民政科的检讨编辑同志：
    五月二十一日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊登了孙玉兰同志和某师政治部组织科对我县第五区人民政府不重视拥军优属工作的批评。经过我们检查，该区对孙玉兰同志家属优待问题，的确注意不够。我们对区人民政府优抚工作检查较差，对此事亦应负责。现在我们除已给五区人民政府以批评及解决孙玉兰同志家属待遇问题外，今后一定加强对各区优抚工作的领导，认真做好这个工作，作为我们抗美援朝的实际行动。现将我县第五区人民政府检讨寄上，请发表。
