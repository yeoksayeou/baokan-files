Shijiazhuang Special District

    Attention to Cotton Market Management
    Significantly Increased Cotton Purchase Quantity

    In June, the Shijiazhuang Special District of Hebei Province purchased over 1,561,000 jin of ginned cotton, an increase of 95% compared to May. In this cotton purchase and storage work, the Shijiazhuang Special District paid attention to strengthening market management, resulting in a significant increase in cotton collection. Before strengthening market management, small vendors' competition to purchase cotton caused a disconnect between the listed cotton price and the market price, seriously affecting the completion of the government's cotton collection work. For example, the local Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company's cotton collection volume accounted for 80% of the total market transaction volume last year, but by May of this year, it had dropped to 40%. Before the start of this cotton purchase and storage work, the Administrative Office's Industry and Commerce Section examined the erroneous view that "market management would hinder free trade and the exchange of local products" and decided to strengthen market management measures. Starting in June, all counties in the special district conducted review and registration work for small vendors, and cotton purchase permits were issued to ginning households that engaged in cotton business year-round. Vendors with cotton purchase permits were required to participate in joint purchasing, conducting unified procurement and unified distribution. The government helped the remaining vendors temporarily switch to other occupations. For example, in Yuanshi County, more than 70 small vendors switched to production or salt peddling, totaling 45 households. After more than 40 small vendors in Weibao Town, Shulu County switched professions, they collected old quilted cotton on behalf of the local native products company. In order to effectively manage the market, various economic departments divided their responsibilities and cooperated with each other. In larger markets, the Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company's cotton collection team was responsible for purchasing and preventing illegal activities by individual vendors, while supply and marketing cooperatives controlled small markets. The tax bureau used tax revenue to understand whether the cotton collection quantity of the traders (vendors participating in joint purchasing) was accurate. In addition, each county universally convened symposiums for small vendors in various markets to strengthen their ideological education and raise their political awareness, so that they would consciously abide by the state's cotton collection work regulations.

    Due to the implementation of the above series of market management measures, the Shijiazhuang Special District eliminated the phenomenon of disconnection between the listed cotton price and the market price, creating favorable conditions for the development of cotton collection work.

### 石家庄专区  注意棉花市场管理  收购棉花数量显著增多

　　石家庄专区
    注意棉花市场管理
    收购棉花数量显著增多
    河北省石家庄专区六月份收购皮棉一百五十六万一千多斤，较五月份增加了百分之九十五。石家庄专区在此次购棉储棉工作中，注意加强市场管理，使收棉量显著增多。该专区在未加强市场管理以前，小贩争购棉花，曾造成市场棉花牌价与市价脱节的现象，严重地影响到政府的收棉工作的完成。如当地花纱布公司去年收棉量占市场总成交量的百分之八十，但至今年五月即降为百分之四十。此次进行购棉、储棉工作之前，专署工商科检查了过去认为“市场管理会妨碍自由贸易和土产交流”的错误观点，决定了加强市场管理的办法。自六月份起，该专区各县都进行了小商贩的审查登记工作，凡常年经营棉花的轧花户发给购棉证。有购棉证的小贩必须参加联购，进行统一采购和统一分配。其余的小贩由政府设法帮助临时转业。如元氏县七十多户小贩，转入生产或贩盐的有四十五户，束鹿县位泊镇四十余户小贩转业后，为当地土产公司代收旧套花。为了有效地管理市场，各经济部门又分工负责，互相配合。较大的集市，由花纱布公司收棉小组负责收购和防止个别小贩的非法活动，小集市由各地供销合作社掌握。税局通过税收，了解交易员（参加联购的商贩）的收棉数量是否确实。此外，各县普遍召开了各集市小贩座谈会，对小贩加强思想教育，提高他们的政治觉悟，使他们自觉地服从国家收棉工作的规定。
    石家庄专区由于实行了以上一系列管理市场的措施，消除了棉花的牌、市价脱节的现象，给收棉工作的开展创造了有利条件。（新华社）
