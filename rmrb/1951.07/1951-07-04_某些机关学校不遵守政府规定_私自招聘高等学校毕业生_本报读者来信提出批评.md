Reader's Letters

Some Agencies and Schools Disregard Government Regulations
Privately Recruit University Graduates
Readers' Letters to This Newspaper Offer Criticism

(I) To the Editors:

On May 20th, the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily criticized certain agencies and schools for not adhering to the principle of unified allocation of university graduates; I completely agree with this criticism. As far as I know, there are still some agencies and factories that are hiring university graduates through various personal connections. For example, a person in charge of the People's Insurance Company, who is also a part-time lecturer at our Tsinghua University, once urged students to choose to work at the insurance company when filling out their application forms. Recently, he even invited the students who volunteered to go to the insurance company to his home for dinner. Comrade Li Li of the state-owned Yongmao Construction Company (a former Tsinghua University graduate) returned to the school to promote the company, saying that the company needs a lot of cadres and that the cadre treatment is good; and said that students who are willing to go can contact him. A professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering wants to "introduce" a student to work in a private factory in Tianjin and let him visit the factory in Tianjin first. A professor in the Department of Civil Engineering also announced in class that a certain soil mechanics laboratory of the Ministry of Railways needs people, and those who are willing to go can sign up with him. A Mr. in the Department of History even asked students to fill out forms to disobey the government's allocation, and to fill in "find their own work" in order to stay at the school as teaching assistants. This erroneous behavior, which violates the government's regulations on the unified allocation of university graduates, has created ideological confusion among the students, made it impossible to implement the principle of unified allocation well, and undermined the country's plans. In order to strictly stop this phenomenon, I request that you disclose this letter and hope that the aforementioned factories, agencies, and schools will conduct a review of this erroneous behavior.

(II) To the Editors:

We fully agree with the criticism of the fourth-year student of the Physics Department of Zhejiang University in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on May 20th regarding certain schools and agencies directly recruiting teaching assistants from various schools. However, this has not yet attracted the attention of the leaders of certain schools and agencies. For example, the Department of Civil Engineering of Peking University and the Department of Civil Engineering of Zhejiang University are still directly asking some graduating students from the Department of Civil Engineering of our Tsinghua University to become teaching assistants. Although the final decision-making power is in the government, this has already caused ideological fluctuations among some students and made it more difficult for the government to carry out the unified allocation work. In addition, a comrade from the state-owned Yongmao Construction Company actually said to several of our classmates: You can come to me, and it will be no problem to introduce a few to work in our company.

The government's unified allocation of university graduates is based on the principle of "combining learning with application and the needs of work" to rationally use cadres. We fully support this principle and obey the government's allocation. We want to seriously criticize the departmentalism of some schools and agencies that "negotiate" with students privately, without considering the overall needs of the motherland and the people.

### 某些机关学校不遵守政府规定  私自招聘高等学校毕业生  本报读者来信提出批评
立之　周玉醴　程学文

专栏：读者来信

　　某些机关学校不遵守政府规定
    私自招聘高等学校毕业生
    本报读者来信提出批评
    （一）编辑同志：
    五月二十日人民日报“读者来信”栏对某些机关学校不遵守高等学校毕业学生统筹分配工作的原则，提出了批评；我完全同意这个批评。据我所知，现在仍有些机关和工厂通过各种私人关系洽聘高等学校毕业同学到该单位工作。例如人民保险公司某负责人在我们清华大学兼课，他就曾号召同学填志愿表时要求到保险公司去工作，最近还把志愿去保险公司的同学邀到家里吃饭。公营永茂建筑公司李立同志（前清华大学毕业学生）回校宣传：该公司需要干部甚多，干部待遇好；并说，愿意去的同学可以找他接洽。电机系某教授要“介绍”一个学生到天津某私营工厂工作，并让他先去天津参观该厂。土木系某教授也在课堂上宣布，铁道部某土工实验室需要人，愿意去的可以找他报名。历史系某先生甚至叫同学填表不服从政府分配，而填“自找工作”，以便留在本校当助教。这种违反政府统筹分配高等学校毕业学生规定的错误行为，在同学中造成思想混乱，并使统一分配原则不能很好贯彻，破坏了国家的计划。为了严格制止这种现象，我要求你们将这封信披露，并且希望上述工厂、机关、学校对这种错误行为进行检讨。
                      清华大学毕业学生  立之
   （二）编辑同志：
    我们完全同意五月二十日人民日报“读者来信”栏中浙江大学物理系四年级同学对某些学校机关直接向各学校招聘助教的批评。但是，这还没有引起某些学校、机关领导方面的注意。譬如北京大学土木系及浙江大学土木系等仍直接要我们清华大学土木系某些毕业同学去做助教。虽然说最后决定权是在政府，但是这已经引起了一些同学思想波动，给政府统一分配工作增加了困难。此外，公营永茂建筑公司某工作同志竟对我们几个同学这样说：你们来找我好了，介绍几个到本公司工作没有问题。
    政府统一分配高等学校毕业学生，是根据“学以致用和工作需要相结合”的原则，合理地使用干部。我们完全拥护这一原则，并服从政府的分配。我们要对某些学校、机关私下和同学“协商”，不考虑祖国人民全面需要的本位主义作风提出严重的批评。
