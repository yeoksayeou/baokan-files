　　Truth Newspaper London Dispatch: "Britain and Separate Peace Treaty with Japan"
　  British Government Shamelessly Bows to US Concessions
    Xinhua News Agency, 28th. Moscow dispatch: The "Truth" newspaper published a London dispatch by Mayevsky on the 27th, entitled "Britain and the Separate Peace Treaty with Japan." He said: The recent negotiations between Washington and London on the draft of the separate peace treaty with Japan clearly illustrate the extent to which the British government's policy of bowing to and making concessions to US imperialism has reached. According to newspaper reports, the negotiations were conducted under strong US pressure, which led to an almost complete consensus between the US and Britain.
    Duress, the notorious special envoy of the US president, who came to London in early June to continue negotiations, insisted that the British government should revise its Far Eastern policy, and first of all revise Britain's relations with the People's Republic of China and Britain's position on the Taiwan issue. Mayevsky emphasized: Duress's request obviously made the representatives of the British government very embarrassed. Due to the rapid increase of sympathy for the People's China among the people of the British Empire and Britain itself, the Labor government still dared not openly sever relations with China.
    The British government's agreement to allow Japan to "freely" decide whether to sign a peace treaty with the People's Republic of China or with the US puppet Chiang Kai-shek is a continuation of its hypocritical policy towards the People's Republic of China.
    British newspapers do not hide the fact that the Labor government supports Duress's proposal in exchange for the US promise of "assistance" in order to overcome the crisis in the Near East, mainly the crisis in Iran.
    Mayevsky continued: The US draft peace treaty with Japan establishes a new situation after the US has tried its best to exclude Britain's position in the Far East and the Pacific region for ten years. The Manchester Guardian wrote: After the conclusion of the treaty and the US-Japan military agreement, the situation will be very similar to that after the conclusion of the Anglo-Japanese alliance in 1902. The United States will occupy the position that Britain occupied at that time. The US-Japan military agreement signed together with the separate treaty will undoubtedly strengthen Japan's position as the main US ally in implementing Washington's aggressive policy in the Far East.
    Mayevsky concluded: Therefore, Britain's hope of uniting the British Empire and supporting US policy to strengthen its position in the Far East has failed. Moreover, Britain has actually encountered a US-Japan group in the Pacific region, which will further cut off the ties between the countries under the British Empire and Britain, and make their policies subject to Washington's aggressive purposes.

### 真理报伦敦通讯：“英国与单独对日和约”  英政府无耻地向美国低头让步

　　真理报伦敦通讯：“英国与单独对日和约”
　  英政府无耻地向美国低头让步
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报二十七日发表马耶夫斯基的伦敦通讯，题为《英国和单独对日和约》。他说：华盛顿与伦敦最近关于单独对日和约草案的谈判，清楚地说明了英国政府向美帝国主义低头让步的政策到了什么地步。据报纸报道，谈判是在美国的强大压力下进行的，这样才使美英两国间几乎完全取得了一致的意见。
    六月初旬来伦敦继续谈判的美国总统特使、臭名远扬的杜勒斯，坚持英国政府应修改其远东政策，而首先应修改英国与中华人民共和国的关系以及英国在台湾问题上的立场。马耶夫斯基着重说：杜勒斯的这种要求显然使英国政府的代表非常狼狈。由于对人民中国的同情心在英帝国以及英国本国的人民中迅速增加，工党政府还不敢公开和中国断绝关系。
    英国政府同意让日本“自由”决定日本愿与中华人民共和国还是与美国傀儡蒋介石签订和约的行动，是从它对中华人民共和国的伪善政策一脉相传下来的。
    英国报纸一点也不隐瞒，工党政府支持杜勒斯的建议，为的是换取美国许诺的“援助”，以便克服近东的危机，主要是伊朗的危机。
    马耶夫斯基继续说：美国的对日和约草案确立了十年来美国极力排斥英国在远东和太平洋地区的地位后的新形势。曼彻斯特卫报写道：和约和美日军事协定签订之后，情形将和一九○二年英日同盟缔结以后极为相似。美国将占据英国当时的那种地位。和单独和约一同签订的美日军事协定，无疑将会加强日本作为执行华盛顿在远东的侵略政策的美国主要盟友的地位。
    马耶夫斯基总结说：因此，英国想团结英帝国并支持美国政策来加强它在远东的地位的这种希望，是落空了。而且，英国在太平洋区实际已遇到一个美日集团，这个集团将更进一步地割断英帝国属下各国与英国的联系，使它们的政策都服从于华盛顿的侵略目的。
