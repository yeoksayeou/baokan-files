　　National Half-Month Agricultural Situation (June 21st to July 5th)
Xinhua News Agency
In the half-month from June 21st to July 5th, most parts of the country completed the sowing of summer fields and the transplanting of rice seedlings. Farmers in North China, Northwest China, Northeast China, and provinces south of the Yangtze River are working intensely on pest control and weeding, while people in areas along rivers are actively engaged in drought and flood prevention.

  Most parts of the country complete summer sowing and transplanting
　　Transplanting of rice seedlings in paddy fields in East China, Central South China, Southwest China, and Southern Manchuria has ended. Sowing of dry land crops in Henan, Hubei, the Plains area, and most parts of Hebei has also been basically completed. Except for Shandong Province, all other provinces and regions in East China have completed summer sowing. Qinghai Province, where the season is later, has also planted potatoes in a timely manner, and the Northeast region is replanting late-maturing crops. Before sowing, drought was prevalent in various places, severely affecting the sowing of summer fields. At this time, local people's governments led farmers to fight drought and plant seeds, and irrigate to protect seedlings, which played a significant role in completing summer sowing in a timely manner. In late June, timely rain fell in parts of East China, Central South China, Northwest China, and North China. Provinces and regions such as Shandong, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Chahar, which had not completed sowing, are now making a final sprint to sow summer fields. In Southwest China, Central South China, and other places, early-planted rice is generally growing well. The early rice in various parts of Hunan has already headed, with long and uniform ears, promising a good harvest.

  Pest Control and Weeding
　　Significant achievements have been made in pest control work in various places. In terms of locust control, according to preliminary statistics, more than one million people have been mobilized in Hebei, the Plains area, Northern Anhui, Shandong, Northern Jiangsu, Henan, Xinjiang, and other provinces and regions in the past half-month, eliminating more than three million mu of locust nymphs. The locust nymphs that occurred early in the East China region have all been eliminated. Locust nymphs in Huanghua County, Hebei Province, and Sihong County, Northern Anhui Province, where the locust plague was severe, have been basically eliminated. Only locust nymphs in a few areas have become winged locusts, harming crops. Farmers are continuing to kill them. In addition to locust nymphs, cotton aphids have also become widespread in cotton fields in various places. The most serious is Handan Prefecture in Hebei Province, where cotton aphids have occurred in two million mu of cotton fields, accounting for 40% of the total cotton field area in the prefecture; cotton aphids have also occurred in more than 30 counties in Shandong Province. People's governments in various places attach great importance to the prevention and control of cotton aphids. Cotton-producing areas such as the Plains area, Hubei, and Henan have generally established organizations for pest control. Shandong and Northern Jiangsu have also held short-term training courses on pest control, training a large number of pest control backbone personnel. The provinces of the Plains area and Henan have trained more than 50,000 people to control cotton aphids. The Central South and North China regions, including the Plains area and Shanxi Province, have lent out more than 10,000 sprayers and more than 600,000 jin of insecticides to help farmers control cotton aphids. Currently, cotton fields in Hebei and the Plains area have generally been treated with pesticides once or twice. Cotton aphids in some areas of Henan Province have been completely eliminated. In the rice-growing areas south of the Yangtze River, rice borers, rice leaf rollers, and case-bearing leaf beetles have recently occurred, harming rice crops. The people's governments in these areas have vigorously mobilized and led farmers to carry out prevention and control. Hunan Province alone has mobilized more than 5 million people, capturing and killing more than 380 million moths and other pests, and more than 12 million clusters of borer eggs.
　　In addition to pest control, farmers in various places are also stepping up weeding. This summer, thanks to the vigorous promotion of more hoeing and weeding by local people's governments to strive for bumper harvests of various crops, the weeding time in various places this year has been advanced compared to previous years, and the number of weeding passes has also increased compared to previous years. At present, cotton fields in Northwest, Central South, Northeast, East China, Hebei, and Shanxi have been hoeed two to three times, and cotton fields in key cotton-producing areas of the Plains Province have been hoeed four to five times. Rice fields in the rice-growing areas of provinces south of the Yangtze River and the Northwest region have generally been weeded once or twice, and early rice fields in the East China and Southwest regions have been hoeed for the third time. Large autumn crops in Northwest, Northeast, Chahar, and Suiyuan have generally been hoeed once, and areas that started hoeing earlier have begun hoeing for the second time. Dryland crops such as sorghum and millet in the East China region have been hoeed for the third time.

  Various places intensify drought and flood prevention
　　At present, the drought situation in many areas has not been resolved. In Xingxian Prefecture, Shanxi Province, 400,000 mu of land has not been sown due to drought, and more than 10,000 mu of grain seedlings in Chahar Province have been killed by drought. Although rain fell in various provinces in the Northwest and Central South regions in late last month, the rainfall was insufficient, and the drought situation is still very serious. In order to intensify drought prevention, the Northwest Military and Political Committee has issued instructions to launch a drought prevention campaign. Jiangxi, Hubei, and Henan provinces have established drought relief committees to uniformly manage water sources, dig canals and repair ponds, regulate water use, and lead farmers to rescue drought-stricken crops. Nanchang Prefecture in Jiangxi has rescued more than 300,000 mu of drought-stricken crops. Jianyang County in Southern Sichuan, Southwest China, has also rescued 440,000 mu of cotton seedlings. In addition, due to excessive rainfall in late June, embankments collapsed in Zhejiang, Southern Anhui, Jilin, and other provinces and regions, flooding 160,000 mu of fields. The people's governments in the above-mentioned areas are leading farmers to repair dikes and drain accumulated water.
　　In the second half of the month, the main agricultural activities in various places will be to continue pest control and weeding. In order to ensure a bumper cotton harvest, topdressing fertilizer should be applied to cotton fields in various places. In addition, various places should also strengthen flood and drought prevention work.

　　全国半月农情  （六月二十一日至七月五日）
    六月二十一日到七月五日的半个月，全国大部地区完成了夏田播种和稻田插秧。华北、西北、东北和长江以南各省农民，正在紧张进行防治虫害和中耕除草，沿江河地区的人民积极进行防旱防涝。
  全国大部地区完成夏种和插秧
    华东、中南、西南和南满地区的水田插秧已经结束。河南、湖北、平原和河北大部地区的旱地播种也已基本完成。华东区除山东省外，其他各省区都完成了夏田播种。季节较晚的青海省也都适时种上了洋芋，东北区正在补种晚熟作物。在播种前，各地曾普呈旱象，严重地影响了夏田的播种。这时，各地人民政府即领导农民抗旱点种和浇水保苗，在适时完成夏种上，作用很大。六月下旬，华东、中南、西北和华北部分地区普降时雨，未完成播种的山东、陕西、甘肃、青海、宁夏、察哈尔等省区，现正在最后突击播种夏田。西南、中南等地今年早种的水稻一般生长良好。湖南各地的早稻已经抽穗，禾穗又长又齐，可望丰收。
  防治虫害和中耕除草
    各地防治虫害的工作已获得很大成绩。在防治蝗蝻方面，据初步统计：河北、平原、皖北、山东、苏北、河南和新疆等省区，半月来共动员一百多万人扑灭了三百余万亩的蝗蝻。华东区早期发生的蝗蝻已全被消灭。蝗灾严重的河北黄骅县和皖北泗洪县的蝗蝻已基本被扑灭，仅有少数地区的蝗蝻已变成飞蝗，为害禾苗。农民正继续扑杀中。除蝗蝻外，各地棉田又普遍发生了棉蚜，最严重的河北省邯郸专区有二百万亩棉田发生棉蚜，占该专区棉田总面积的百分之四十；山东省亦有三十多个县发生棉蚜。各地人民政府对于防治棉蚜极为重视，平原、湖北、河南等棉区普遍设立防治虫害的组织，山东、苏北又举办了防治虫害的短期训练班，培养出大批治虫骨干，平原、河南两省共训练防治棉蚜的人员五万多人。中南区和华北区平原、山西两省共贷放喷雾器一万多部，杀虫药剂六十多万斤，帮助农民防治棉蚜。现在，河北、平原两省的棉田已普遍用药剂治了一遍至两遍。河南省部分地区的棉蚜已全部被消灭。长江以南水稻地区近来均发生螟虫、稻苞虫和负泥虫为害稻禾。这些地区的人民政府已大力动员和领导农民防治，仅湖南省就动员了五百多万人，捕杀螟蛾及其他害虫三亿八千多万只，螟卵一千二百多万块。
    各地农民除防治虫害外，又加紧进行中耕除草。今夏由于各地人民政府大力提倡多锄多耘，争取各种作物丰收，因此，今年各地的锄草时间较往年提早，锄草的遍数也比往年增加。目前，西北、中南、东北、华东和河北、山西的棉田已锄完两遍到三遍，平原省产棉重点区的棉田已锄了四遍至五遍。长江以南各省和西北区的水稻地区的稻田，已普遍耘草一次至两次，华东和西南两区的早稻田，已锄了第三遍。西北、东北和察哈尔、绥远等地的大秋作物已普遍锄了一次，开锄较早的地区已开始锄第二次，华东区旱地作物高粱、谷子等已锄完第三遍。
  各地加紧防旱防涝
    目前，许多地区的旱象仍未解除，山西省兴县专区有四十万亩土地因旱还未下种，察哈尔省一万多亩谷苗被旱死。西北、中南两区各省于上月下旬虽已落雨，但雨量不足，旱象仍很严重。为加紧防旱，西北军政委员会已发出开展防旱运动的指示。江西、湖北、河南各省并成立了抗旱委员会，统一管理水源，开渠修塘，调剂用水，并领导农民抢救受旱禾苗。江西南昌专区已救出受旱禾苗三十多万亩。西南区川南简阳县亦抢救了四十四万亩棉苗。此外，浙江、皖南、吉林等省区六月下旬因雨水过多，河堤溃决，淹田十六万亩。上述地区人民政府正在领导农民修复圩堤，排除积水。
    下半月各地的主要农事活动，是要继续防治虫害和中耕除草。为了保证棉花丰收，各地棉田要施追肥。此外，各地还要加强防涝防旱的工作。
