　　The Party Cultivated Me to Become a People's Air Force Fighter
    Li Han
    Since the day I joined the embrace of the Party, I began to live a new and meaningful life. I am grateful to the Party for its twelve years of cultivation and education, which has enabled me to become a People's Air Force fighter now. I feel honored! This honor is given to me by the Party, by the wise leader Chairman Mao! I will never forget the education and cultivation the Party has given me; and I will always remember: what I should do for the Party and for the people.
    I, the son of a poor peasant, lost my father when I was three years old, leaving behind a group of orphans—my sister and I. The heavy burden of life weighed on my mother. In the evil old society, the poorer you were, the less likely anyone would help. My mother barely managed to raise us by spinning, weaving, selling tofu, and working as a hired hand, eating bran and wild herbs. When I was eight years old, I wanted to study and cried to go to school. My mother, like all kind mothers who loved their children, did not want to refuse her son's request. She would rather go without food herself and sell the land to let her son study. In the end, she sold her only means of production—the loom—and勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强勉强就这样勉强地供我念了几年书. Life became more and more difficult. What would happen in the future?
    The Communist Party came, the Eighth Route Army came. The people were saved, and my family was saved. From then on, I devoted myself to the embrace of the revolution and gradually grew up under the glorious nurture of the Party. When I was working in the district Youth Salvation Association doing children's work, I lived with an old Communist Party member, a party representative, and the district party secretary. He was very busy with his work and suffered from severe tuberculosis, coughing up blood every morning; but he still spent some time and energy to educate me. He gave me political lessons every day, told me what the Party was, what a Party member was, taught me how to work, and taught me how to make political reports at the teachers' joint meetings. During this period, I began to understand the Party, appreciate the greatness of the Party, and receive the warmth of the revolutionary family. I got closer to the Party, accepted the Party's education, and I requested to join the Party. From then on, I became a Communist Party member. What an honorable title that is!
    At that time, I was only sixteen years old. In order to make me a useful person, the Party sent me to a school led by the Party to receive education. The education I received at the United University and Yan'an University is unforgettable. Under the patient teaching of the teachers and the enthusiastic help of the students, not only did my cultural level improve, but my political level also gradually improved.
    Flying—this is the career I have been idealizing and hoping for since I was a child. Now, the ideal has become a reality, which is the result of the Party's tireless concern and nurturing. Let me recall how the Party cultivated me to become a People's Air Force fighter:
    In 1945, Japanese imperialism surrendered. Under difficult conditions, the Party carried out preparations for building the People's Air Force. The Party sent many outstanding sons and daughters to study aviation, and I was one of those transferred at that time. We shouldered the infinite expectations of the Party and the people, and joyfully entered aviation school. After a period of ground study, we began our flying life. I remember very clearly that on May 8, 1947, I sat in my own people's plane for the first time, with the instructor sitting behind me, flying. Day after day, we flew and gradually learned to master the technology. I thought that in the future, I would be more likely to use the technology the Party gave me to defend the motherland's airspace and repay the Party and the people for their nurturing.
    At that time, equipment was very scarce. But under the leadership of the Party, no difficulty could not be overcome. Under extremely difficult conditions, flight training continued. The Party led us to come up with many methods, some of which were unexpected. In this way, we were still able to fly solo after a short period of dual instruction.
    Thinking of the Party's concern for our studies in such difficult circumstances, we are truly grateful from the bottom of our hearts. I remember that when I was flying alone for the first time, I couldn't help but sing "Without the Communist Party, there would be no China" in the air. Later I learned that many students sang so excitedly at the time.
    However, the more important task is still ahead! We need to learn to fight in the air. Only by skillfully learning aerial combat can we eliminate aerial invaders. Under the Party's active cultivation, I learned to fly new fighter jets.

### 党培养我成为人民空军战士

　　党培养我成为人民空军战士
    李汉
    自从我投入党的怀抱那一天起，就开始度着新的、有意义的生活。感谢党对我十二年来的培养教育，使我现在能成为一个人民空军战士，我感到了光荣！这光荣是党给我的，是英明的领袖毛主席给我的。我永远忘不了党给我的教育和培养；也永远记着：为了党、为了人民，自己应该作些什么。
    我，一个贫农的儿子，三岁时就死了父亲，留下我们一群孤儿寡女——我和我的姐姐，沉重的生活负担压着我的母亲。在罪恶的旧社会里，人越穷越没有人肯帮助，仅仅靠着母亲纺线、织布、卖豆腐、作雇工，吃糠咽菜地把我们拉扯大了。八岁的时候，我想念书，哭着要上学，母亲像所有善良的、爱自己儿女的母亲一样，不愿拒绝儿子的要求，宁可自己不吃，卖了地也要让自己的儿子念书。最后她把自己唯一的生产工具——织布机也卖了，就这样勉强地供我念了几年书。生活越来越困难了，以后怎么办呢？
    共产党来了，八路军来了。人民得救了，我家也得救了。从此，我就投入了革命的怀抱，在党的光辉抚育下，渐渐地成长起来。我在区青救会作儿童工作时，和一位老共产党员、党代表、区委书记住在一起。他工作很忙，而且患着严重的肺痨病，每天早晨都要吐血；但他仍花些时间和精力来教育我。他每天给我上政治课，告诉我党是什么，党员是什么，教给我如何工作，教给我怎样在教员联席会上作政治报告。在这一个时期中，我开始认识了党，体会到党的伟大，领受了革命大家庭的温暖。我靠近了党，接受了党的教育，我请求入了党。从此我就成为一个共产党员了。共产党员，这是多么光荣的称号啊！
    那时，我才十六岁。党为了使我成为一个有用的人，就把我送到党所领导下的学校去受教育。联大、延大对我的教育是不能忘怀的。在教师诲人不倦的教导、同学热情的帮助之下，不但提高了我的文化水平，而且政治水平也逐步地提高了。
    飞行——这是我从小就理想着，企望着的事业。现在，理想已成为现实了，这是党对我不倦的关心和哺育的结果。让我回忆一下党是怎样培养我成为人民空军战士的：
    一九四五年日本帝国主义投降，党在困难的条件下，进行了建设人民空军的准备工作。党送了许多优秀的儿女去学航空，我也是在那时被调去的一个。我们承受了党和人民的无限期望，欢欣鼓舞地进入航校。经过了一段地面学习后，就开始了飞行生活。我记得很清楚，那是在一九四七年的五月八日，我第一次坐上人民自己的飞机，后边坐着教员，飞行了。一天天飞下去，也一天天学会掌握技术。我想到今后将更有可能将党交给我的技术来捍卫祖国的领空，回答党和人民对我的抚育了。
    那时器材非常缺乏。但是在党的领导下，没有任何困难是克服不了的。在极端困难的条件下，飞行训练依然继续着。党领导我们想出许多办法，甚至有些办法是令人意想不到的。就这样，我们依然在短时间带飞后能单独飞行了。
    想到党在这样困难的情况下对我们的学习如此关怀，我们真是衷心地感戴。我记得，在我第一次一个人飞行时，到空中后情不自禁地唱起“没有共产党就没有中国”。以后才知道，许多同学当时都这样兴奋地唱过。
    但是，更重要的任务还在后头呢！我们需要学会在空中作战。只有熟练地学会了空中战斗，才能消灭空中的侵略者。在党的积极培养下，我学会了新式战斗机的飞行。
