Ren Baige, chairman of the Chongqing Branch of the Resist America and Aid Korea Association, reported on the general situation of Chongqing's Resist America and Aid Korea work, pointing out that the main shortcomings of the current movement are that some patriotic pacts have become a formality, and some donations have not been combined with increased production and increased income. The meeting decided: to conduct a city-wide inspection of patriotic pacts before the end of July, to effectively formulate and revise patriotic pacts, and to conduct another major inspection throughout the city by the end of the year to evaluate models for implementing patriotic pacts; to strengthen leadership over the donation movement, so that the donation movement is combined with increased production and increased income; this year's "August 1st" Army Day should launch a large-scale campaign of preferential treatment work and conduct a major inspection.
