    Oppose the Tendency of Not Asking About Politics!
　　Liaoning Province, Xi'an County Cooperative Cadres Should Pay Attention to Correcting the Tendency of Not Asking About Politics. Editor:
    In our Xi'an County, Liaoning Province, there is a prevalent tendency among cooperative cadres to not concern themselves with politics, which consequently affects the improvement and development of cooperative business. This tendency is first manifested in the leadership of the county cooperative. In the past, when convening meetings of cooperative cadres, the leaders only led everyone to discuss business matters, rarely talking about political issues. Also, when county cooperative cadres went to lower-level cooperatives to inspect work, they mostly limited themselves to business aspects. For example, if they saw that a cooperative accountant's books were up-to-date, they would consider him a good cadre. If they saw that a cooperative's business was relatively active, they would consider the cooperative to be good, rarely inquiring about the political awareness and political learning of the cadres. Many cooperative cadres confine themselves to the business circle, not studying Marxist-Leninist theory, not studying current affairs policies. They do not understand the laws of social development, do not know the current political situation, and are not clear about the cooperative's bright future. Especially some accounting workers, who bury themselves in their books all day long, do not read, do not read newspapers, like Comrade Sun Guoqing, the accountant of Jiashan Village Cooperative, who knows very little about the large-scale suppression of counter-revolutionaries. As time goes on, this produces various undesirable tendencies: some think there is no future in working in the cooperative, earning little money, and are unwilling to do it; some are tired of work and passively go slow; some even embezzle and become corrupt.
    Since the fourth quarter of last year, the leadership has arranged for the rectification of cooperative work. The leaders of the county cooperative have convened various large and small meetings, calling on everyone to "serve the members and improve the organizational structure." The cadres of lower-level cooperatives have also been busy with this, but many cooperatives have not made much progress to date. I think the tendency of cooperative cadres to not concern themselves with politics is an important reason affecting the development of cooperative business.
    In addition, I also feel that in the past, many cooperative cadres only emphasized how cooperatives serve their members when promoting cooperatives to members and the masses. They simply encouraged people to join the cooperative from an economic point of view, without adequately explaining the economic nature and economic status of cooperatives in our country, enhancing the masses' understanding of cooperatives from a political perspective, and educating the masses to more actively support the cooperative.
    Regarding how to correct the tendency of cooperative cadres not concerning themselves with politics, I have the following suggestions: (1) The county cooperative should strengthen the leadership of political study, uniformly arrange study materials, conduct regular inspections and summaries, and hope to conduct universal retraining of cooperative cadres this year, focusing on political and current affairs ideological education; (2) Urge all cooperatives to seriously study important policy issues such as resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, establishing patriotic pacts, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and appoint a cadre with a higher level of political and cultural knowledge to serve as a propagandist in each cooperative, to publicize policies and current affairs to cadres and members; (3) When county cooperative cadres go to the countryside, they should prepare certain political current affairs propaganda materials, to publicize and explain to cadres in each cooperative, and can also hold temporary quizzes; (4) When the county cooperative convenes lower-level cooperative cadres to arrange or summarize work, do not isolate business, and be sure to pay attention to political issues.

　　I examined my own ideological tendency of not concerning myself with politics. Editor:
    After studying the People's Daily article "Oppose the Tendency of Not Asking About Politics," it was like taking a political lesson. Because I also have the same tendency of not asking about politics. In the沁阳(Qinyang) County Committee of the Communist Party's test of current affairs, county cadres are not as good as district cadres, and district cadres are not as good as village cadres. I think, if we were to give a test to county leaders, there would be a similar situation. In the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the leadership sent me to Guo Village to participate in the inspection work. At that time, the village cadres asked me "What is a counter-revolutionary element?" and I vaguely said a few words about stubbornness and incorrigibility.... When I came back and looked at the explanations of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in the current affairs manual, I realized that the answer was very unspecific. The simple business views and bureaucratic work style of our agency cadres are very serious. If there are similar situations among our vast number of cadres, it will cause irreparable losses to the cause of the Party and the people, and to the construction work of the motherland.
    Why do the above ideas arise? Mainly: (1) Insufficient political awareness. In daily work, I only know that it is right to complete my own business and the work arranged by the superiors, but I don't know that my own business work is to serve politics. (2) The serious existence of hedonistic thinking. It is manifested in not being arduous in work, doing whatever the leadership asks to do, and not being proactive. Political work is considered to be the affair of the leadership, or the affair of relevant departments, and has little to do with oneself. But one is very thoughtful about one's daily life, without thinking about the deeds of our People's Volunteers, who sacrificed themselves and worked hard on the Korean battlefield for the motherland and the people.
    Due to the serious existence of the above situation, there is a tendency of not asking about politics and not caring about national affairs. It is believed that the leaders will naturally have a way to deal with current affairs issues, and we do not need to worry about them. Sometimes, when comrades talk about political issues, they are very annoyed and do not want to listen.
    After this study and self-examination, I realized that these past views were very wrong. In the future, I will be determined to overcome these shortcomings, seriously study revolutionary theory, pay attention to political issues, improve my political level, and strive harder for the revolutionary cause.

    Oppose Vulgar Business Propaganda!
    The Guangdong Branch of the People's Insurance Company Should Not Print Publicity Pictures with Incorrect Content. Editor:
    Recently, I saw in Pingshan Market, Huaxian County, Guangdong, a poster printed by the Guangdong Branch of the People's Insurance Company of China publicizing various types of people's insurance. I think the content of this picture is very wrong.
    Most of the picture is a dim, dark gray. On the left half, there is a worker with a sad and troubled face, infinitely dejected. Behind the worker is a factory building burning fiercely, with some unclear lines next to it, as if it were a bomb. In the middle of the picture is a ship in distress, the waves outside the ship are turbulent, and the ship also seems to be on fire. In addition, there are cars and trains colliding on the tracks. On the right side of the picture is a dying patient struggling, next to a middle-aged farmer holding a bundle of rice ears with two large worms on it (almost longer than the farmer's face). In the lower right corner are two weak and emaciated cows, probably sick cows. On this dim and terrifying picture, the blood-red words "There is always danger, insurance is not afraid of danger!" are written in large characters. The entire propaganda idea of the artist and the insurance company is vividly expressed in these ten words.
    But, in fact, is there really "always danger" in the people's New China? As long as one is not a muddle-headed person, one can know that the safety of railway transportation and shipping in New China is unprecedented in history; fires, etc. have also been greatly reduced compared to the past; insect plagues, floods, and livestock diseases in agricultural production have been greatly reduced under the leadership of the People's Government and the efforts of the masses to prevent and control them. Although "danger" is not non-existent in New China, this picture depicts New China as being in a state of turmoil, as if one cannot live without insurance, which is obviously extremely wrong. In order to actively develop the insurance business, we should correctly publicize to the people that insurance is to ensure the smooth progress of the people's lives and national economic construction; and we should never, like the Guangdong Branch of the People's Insurance Company of China, use bad, terrifying pictures to scare people into buying insurance.

    (According to a reader's letter published by Southern Daily, the text has been slightly modified.)
    Editor's note: The erroneous propaganda picture pointed out by the Southern Daily reader Li Tian typically reflects the vulgar bourgeois propaganda views of certain business departments. They only know how to develop their own business in isolation, and do not hesitate to use various false and harmful things to promote to the masses. No public or private enterprise in New China should carry out propaganda in this way.

  Correct the Tendency of Neglecting Political Study. Editor:
    The letter from Comrade Shulin published in the People's Daily reader's column on June 21 criticizing some comrades in our bureau for neglecting political study was very helpful to us. In the past, our bureau did have a tendency to neglect political study, which greatly hindered our progress. Now we have conducted an inspection on the neglect of political study based on this criticism.
    The neglect of political study is primarily because the leadership of our bureau has neglected the organization, leadership, supervision and inspection of political study, causing political study to fall into a state of free flow. After the publication of the criticism against us in the newspaper, we conducted ideological inspections in conjunction with the "July 1st" study. Among the nineteen comrades, five older comrades have serious politically negative "regression" thinking, such as some believing that they are old and cannot accomplish anything even if they study again; some cadres from peasant backgrounds with lower levels of education feel that intellectuals have all joined the work, so we are useless, and it is not home after two or three more years, so they do not want to study. There are also a few comrades who have neglected political study for a long time, and work in the old way, doing everything based on experience, believing that they can work without studying politics. In addition, eleven comrades only pay attention to studying culture and neglect political study.
    Combined with the study of the party's thirty-year history and the "Notice on Opposing the Tendency of Not Asking About Politics" issued by the Xinxiang Local Committee of the Communist Party of China in Pingyuan Province, everyone exposed and criticized the above-mentioned erroneous ideas that hinder political study, and realized that neglecting political study is the basic reason for making mistakes in past work and not making rapid progress.
    On the basis of having a further understanding, we first stipulated the system and methods of study, and included adhering to political and cultural study as one of the items in our bureau's patriotic pact; some comrades, in order to strengthen the study of policies and current affairs, also prepared to establish a reading group to read newspapers every day.

### 反对不问政治的倾向！

    反对不问政治的倾向！
　　辽东省西安县合作社干部应注意纠正不问政治倾向编辑同志：
    在我们辽东省西安县合作社干部中，普遍存在着不问政治的倾向，并因而影响到合作社业务的改进和发展。不问政治的倾向首先表现在县合作社的领导上，过去在每次召开合作社干部会议时，只是领导大家讨论合作社的业务问题，很少谈论政治问题；同时县合作社干部到下级社检查工作时，也多是仅限于业务方面，如看到那个合作社会计的账目没有拉下，就认为是好干部，再看到这个合作社的业务活跃些，就认为这个合作社不错，至于干部的政治觉悟和政治学习，就很少过问。而不少合作社干部，只是把自己限制在业务圈子里，不学习马克思列宁主义的理论，不学习时事政策，自己不了解社会的发展规律，不知道现在的政治形势，不清楚合作社的远大前途。特别是一些会计工作者，整天埋头整账，不读书，不看报，如甲山村合作社会计孙国庆同志，连大张旗鼓镇压反革命，也知道得很少。这样日子常了，就产生了各种不良倾向：有的认为在合作社工作没有前途，挣钱少，就不愿干；有的工作疲蹋，消极怠工；有的甚至贪污腐化。
    自从去年第四季度起，领导上布置了整顿合作社的工作。县合作社领导上召开各种大小会议，号召大家“为社员服务，健全组织机构”，下级合作社干部为此也一直在奔忙着，但有不少合作社，至今成绩不大。我想，合作社干部不问政治的倾向，不能不是影响合作社业务开展的重要原因之一。
    另外，我还感到不少合作社干部过去在对社员及群众的宣传上，只是宣传合作社如何为社员服务，单纯从经济利益上宣传群众入合作社，而未很好说明合作社在我们国家中的经济性质和经济地位，从政治上提高群众对合作社的认识，教育群众更加积极地拥护和支持合作社。
    对于如何纠正合作社干部不问政治的倾向，我有以下几点建议：（一）县合作社应加强政治学习的领导，统一布置学习材料，按期检查总结，并希望今年对合作社干部普遍轮训一次，着重进行政治及时事思想教育；（二）督促各社认真学习抗美援朝、订立爱国公约、镇压反革命等重要政策问题，并指定各社有一名政治、文化较高的干部担任宣传员，向干部及社员宣传政策时事；（三）县合作社干部下乡，要准备一定的政治时事宣传材料，向各社干部宣传讲解，还可举行临时测验；（四）县合作社在召集下级社干部开会布置或总结工作时，不要孤立地搞业务，一定要注意政治问题。

　　我检查了自己不问政治的思想倾向编辑同志：
    我学习了人民日报《反对不问政治的倾向》一文后，等于给我上了一次政治课。因为我也同样有不问政治的倾向。中共沁阳县委会在测验时事中，县干部不如区干部，区干部不如村干部。我想，我们县领导上来个测验的话，也会有类似的情形。在镇压反革命工作中，领导上派我到郭村参加检查工作，当时村干部问我“什么叫作反革命分子”，我就含含糊糊地说了两句怙恶不悛……。回来看了看时事手册上对镇压反革命问题的解释，才知道答的很不具体。我们机关干部的单纯业务观点，和事务主义的工作作风是很严重的。如果我们广大干部之间存在着类似情况的话，那就会使党使人民的事业，使祖国的建设工作，受到不可补偿的损失。
    为啥会产生以上思想呢？主要是：（一）政治觉悟不够。在日常工作中，只知道把自己的业务和上级布置的工作完成了就对了，而不知道自己的业务工作是为政治服务的。（二）享乐思想的严重存在。表现在工作中不艰苦，领导上叫干啥就干啥，不主动。对政治工作认为是领导上的事情，或有关部门的事情，与自己关系不大。但是对自己的日常生活上的事情，打算的非常周到，而没有想到我们的人民志愿军，为祖国为人民在朝鲜战场上，牺牲自己艰苦奋斗的事迹。
    由于以上情况的严重存在，而产生了不问政治，不关心国家大事的倾向。认为时事问题，领导上自然有办法，用不着我们去管，有时，同志们在一块谈论政治问题，自己还很厌烦，不想听。
    经过了这次的学习与自我检查，才认识到过去的这些观点是十分错误的。今后定要下决心克服这些缺点，认真学习革命理论，注意政治问题，提高自己的政治水平，更好的为革命事业而奋斗。

    反对庸俗的业务宣传！
    人民保险公司广东省分公司不该印制内容错误的宣传画编辑同志：
    最近我在广东花县平山墟看见一幅中国人民保险公司广东分公司印制的宣传各种人民保险的招贴画，我认为这张画的内容是十分错误的。
    画面的大部分是暗淡的深灰色的。左半面，画有一个工人愁眉苦脸，无限颓丧。工人后面画着一座正在被熊熊大火燃烧着的工厂房屋，旁边有些看不清的线条，仿佛是个炸弹。画面中间是一只遇险的轮船，船外波涛汹涌，船上也像是着了火。另外还有汽车和火车在铁轨上相撞。画面的右方是一个垂死的病人在挣扎着，旁边有一个中年农民，拿着一束田禾，上面有两条大虫（几乎比那农民的脸还要长）。右下方有两条羸弱不堪的牛，大概是病牛吧。在这一幅黯淡恐怖的画面上，血红的大字写着“随时都有险，保险不怕险！”作画者和保险公司的全部宣传思想，生动地表现在这十个字上面。
    但是，事实上，在人民的新中国，是否真是“随时都有险”呢？只要不是昏头昏脑的人，都可以知道：新中国的铁路交通和航运的安全是历史上未有过的；火灾等也比过去大大地减少；农业生产上的虫灾、水患、畜病，在人民政府领导群众努力防治下，已大大减少了。在新中国，“险”虽不是没有，但这幅画把新中国描绘得水深火热，似乎不保险就不能活下去，显然是极端错误的。为了积极开展保险业务，应该正确地向人民宣传说明保险是为了保障人民的生活和国家经济建设的顺利进行；而绝不应当像中国人民保险公司广东分公司这样，用恶劣的恐怖的画来恐吓人民去保险。

    （据南方日报发表的读者来信，文字略有修改。）
    编者按：南方日报读者李田所指出的这幅错误的宣传画，典型地反映了某些企业部门的庸俗的资产阶级的宣传观点，他们只知孤立地发展自己的业务，不惜用各种虚伪的有害的东西向人民群众进行宣传。新中国的一切公私企业，都不应该这样进行宣传。

  纠正忽视政治学习的倾向编辑同志：
    六月二十一日人民日报读者来信栏发表了树林同志批评我局有些同志忽视政治学习的来信，这个批评对我们很有帮助。过去我局确实存在着忽视政治学习的倾向，并因此大大妨碍了我们的进步。现在我们已根据这个批评，进行了关于忽视政治学习的检查。
    忽视政治学习，首先是因为我局的领导方面忽视了关于政治学习的组织领导和督促检查，使政治学习陷于自流状态。报纸上发表了对我们的批评以后，我们就结合着“七一”的学习，进行学习思想检查。在十九个同志中，有五个年龄比较大的同志存在着严重的政治上的消极“退坡”思想，如有的认为自己年纪大了，再学习也干不成什么了；有的文化程度较低的农民出身的干部感到知识分子都参加工作了，咱们不中用了，再干二三年还不是回家，所以就不想去学习了。还有几个同志，长期忽视政治学习，工作起来是老一套，一切凭经验办事，认为不学政治也可以工作。另外有十一个同志，只注意学习文化而忽视了政治学习。
    大家结合着学习党的三十年历史和中共平原省新乡地方委员会“反对不问政治的倾向”的通报，揭发和批评了上述妨碍进行政治学习的错误思想，认识到了忽视政治学习是过去工作中犯错误和自己进步不快的基本原因。
    在这样有了进一步觉悟的基础上，我们首先规定了学习的制度和办法，并且把坚持政治和文化学习这一项，订为我局爱国公约中的一项；有的同志为了加强政策时事学习，还准备成立读报组，每天读报。
