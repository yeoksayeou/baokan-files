　　How the Chinese People Defeated the Armed Chiang Kai-shek Reactionary Clique of American Imperialism
　　Zhu De
　　As we commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the heroic struggle of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese revolution has achieved a nationwide victory. The reactionary rule of the powerful enemies of the Chinese people—the alliance of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism—has been finally overthrown. A great new China under the people's democratic dictatorship has been firmly established and developed. This is a great victory that marks the entry of the entire history of China into a new era. It is also a great victory of historical significance, following the victory of the October Revolution and the victory of the World Anti-Fascist War, which has changed the face of the entire East and the world. This victory has greatly strengthened the forces of the world's peace and democracy camp and has shaken the entire imperialist aggression camp.
　　It is meaningful to recall how the Chinese people defeated the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang reactionary clique armed by American imperialism and finally achieved national victory.
　　The Communist Party of China, armed with Marxism-Leninism and led by the great Comrade Mao Zedong, independently led the Chinese people after the failure of the revolution from 1924 to 1927. After ten years of domestic war from 1927 to 1936, it created a people's revolutionary force and a political and military line suitable for the actual situation of the Chinese revolutionary struggle. After eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan from 1937 to 1945, this people's revolutionary force was further developed and strengthened, and the liberated areas with a population of approximately 100 million and the People's Liberation Army with 1 million soldiers, as well as 2.2 million militiamen, were created. All of these constitute the solid foundation on which the Chinese people relied to defeat the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang reactionary clique armed by American imperialism.
　　After the end of World War II, the people of the world urgently demanded to maintain peace. The Chinese people, who had suffered from long-term war and were threatened by a new domestic war, especially urgently demanded to realize peace. However, American imperialism, which replaced the position of fascist Germany, Italy, and Japan after World War II, was frantically pushing forward its plan to enslave the world, threatening the people of the world with war, and directly creating wars in China and elsewhere. Although American imperialism agreed at the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States in December 1945 not to interfere in China's internal affairs and expressed its hope that China would achieve peace and democracy, in practice, after the surrender of Japanese imperialism, it sent land, sea, and air forces and military missions to China, occupied the majority of strategic locations in the country, supplied the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique with a large amount of military equipment and war materials, and helped Chiang Kai-shek, who had been hiding in the far rear during the War of Resistance Against Japan, to move his large army to coastal cities and the front lines of the anti-people civil war, in order to seize the fruits of the Chinese people's victory through Chiang Kai-shek and turn China into a colony of the United States. Under the support and instigation of American imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek fully implemented the traitorous and dictatorial reactionary policy. American imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique believed that the Chinese People's Liberation Army was the fundamental obstacle to their realization of their reactionary plan. Without eliminating the People's Liberation Army, American imperialism's aggression and Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship could not be realized. At the same time, they believed that the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people's demand for domestic peace was a manifestation of weakness and could be easily bullied. They believed that the smaller and poorly equipped Chinese People's Liberation Army was vulnerable, while the millions of Kuomintang troops who had received a large amount of aid from American imperialism could run rampant throughout the country. Therefore, they decided to launch an anti-people civil war in China. Only to buy time to prepare for this civil war did they temporarily pretend to agree with the peace aspirations of the people.
　　Under such circumstances, the Communist Party of China, on the one hand, resolutely held high the banner of peace, democracy, and unity, and led the Chinese people with great efforts to seek ways to avoid war and realize peace; on the other hand, it mobilized the entire Party, the military and civilians in the liberated areas, and even the people of the whole country to make full preparations, so that when Chiang Kai-shek resolutely undermined peace, they would be prepared to defeat his anti-people and counter-revolutionary military offensive. The Communist Party of China represented the demands of the broad masses of the people and continuously issued many calls for peace, democracy, and unity; Comrade Mao Zedong personally went to Chongqing to conduct peace talks with Chiang Kai-shek; forced Chiang Kai-shek to issue a ceasefire order; convened a political consultation conference of various parties, and established a resolution on realizing peace, democracy, and unity, which was attended and passed by representatives of the Kuomintang government. All these steps were fully in line with the demands of the broad masses of the people for domestic peace, democracy, and unity. Because the Communist Party of China adopted a firm, selfless, and just position in this fierce struggle, and because Chiang Kai-shek and his master, American imperialism, repeatedly exposed their perfidy and their conspiracy to "mediate" the civil war conflict on the one hand and actively arrange the civil war on the other hand in front of the Chinese people, the broad masses of the people were able to eliminate their illusions about American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique from their own personal experience. Therefore, when American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang reactionary clique felt that they had completed large-scale anti-people and counter-revolutionary civil war preparations, they also became politically isolated and lost the sympathy of the people.
　　In early July 1946, with the strong support of the United States, Chiang Kai-shek, disregarding the opposition of the Chinese people and world democratic public opinion, launched an unprecedented full-scale civil war against the People's Liberation Army in Chinese history. The initial situation of this civil war was once serious for the Chinese people. The world's largest imperialism vigorously supported the world's largest traitorous clique. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique at that time had a total force of 4.3 million, with modern equipment and materials such as airplanes, artillery, tanks, etc. worth approximately 6 billion US dollars supplied by American imperialism, a ruling area with a population of over 330 million, large cities and abundant resources, and modern industrial and transportation conditions. On the other hand, the Chinese People's Liberation Army at that time had less than one-third of the Kuomintang army in terms of troop strength, and its equipment and resources were even more inferior. The liberated areas also had less than one-third of the population of Chiang Kai-shek's ruling area. In terms of the comparison of military forces between the two sides, except for the political qualities of the People's Liberation Army and its connection with the people being superior to Chiang Kai-shek, all other aspects were at a disadvantage. Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek dared to use 1.8 million regular troops at the beginning of the war, launching a full-scale offensive against the liberated areas of Northeast, Central Plains, East China, and North China with great momentum, attempting to eliminate the People's Liberation Army in one fell swoop. But as Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The Communist Party of China, based on the science of Marxism-Leninism, soberly estimated the international and domestic situation, and knew that the attacks of all domestic and foreign reactionaries must not only be defeated, but can also be defeated." "The enemy's superiority in military strength is only a temporary phenomenon, and this is only a temporarily functioning factor; the aid of American imperialism is also only a temporarily functioning factor; and the anti-people nature of Chiang Kai-shek's war, and the popular sentiment, are constantly functioning factors; and in this respect, the People's Liberation Army has the advantage. The patriotic, just, and revolutionary nature of the People's Liberation Army's war will inevitably win the support of the people throughout the country. This is the political foundation for defeating Chiang Kai-shek." The course and outcome of the war fully proved the correctness of Comrade Mao Zedong's judgment.
　　Based on Comrade Mao Zedong's scientific analysis and judgment, the Communist Party of China and the People's Liberation Army, on the one hand, closely united the broad masses of the people in the liberated areas and the broad masses of the people throughout the country, providing material and spiritual support for this large-scale people's revolutionary war; on the other hand, resolutely implemented the military guiding line of concentrating absolutely superior forces and annihilating the enemy one by one, which was personally stipulated by Comrade Mao Zedong. At the same time, the revolutionary political work of uniting the people, uniting officers and soldiers, disintegrating the enemy army, and transforming prisoners was fully implemented in the army, so that we could continuously weaken the Kuomintang army and strengthen ourselves in the People's Liberation War, and seize the Kuomintang army's armaments to arm ourselves. In the early stage of the war when Chiang Kai-shek launched a full-scale offensive and invaded our liberated areas, although we lost many cities and vast rural areas, the People's Liberation Army annihilated approximately eight brigades of the Kuomintang army's effective strength on average every month. After eight months, because Chiang Kai-shek's troop strength was greatly weakened, Chiang Kai-shek was forced to abandon the full-scale offensive and could only launch so-called "key offensives" on the two wings of the front line, namely Shandong and Shaanxi. The troops used by Chiang Kai-shek to attack the Shandong liberated area accounted for approximately one-third of its total offensive force, namely 60 brigades, while the enemy troops attacking the Shaanxi liberated area were equivalent to ten times the local People's Liberation Army. However, because the People's Liberation Army implemented the correct strategic principle of concentrating absolutely superior forces and annihilating the enemy one by one in each battle, and did not take conserving cities or localities as the main goal, the Chinese People's Liberation Army not only quickly smashed Chiang Kai-shek's "key offensives," but also launched local counter-offensives against Chiang Kai-shek on the Northeast and North China battlefields during this period.
　　By the end of the first year of the war, the People's Liberation Army had annihilated 97 and a half brigades of the enemy, 1.12 million people, and developed its regular army from 1.2 to 1.3 million to 2 million. The war situation underwent a fundamental change as a result: the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, which had lost huge effective forces, had to shift from strategic offensive to strategic defense.
　　From the second year of the Chinese People's Liberation War, the Chinese People's Liberation Army shifted from strategic defense to strategic offensive. This was a change of overall importance to the history of the Chinese People's Revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong at that time declared: "This is the turning point in the development to the elimination of Chiang Kai-shek's twenty years of counter-revolutionary rule. This is the turning point in the development to the elimination of imperialism's rule in China for more than a hundred years." In the offensive against the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique, the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yellow River southwards, smashed the Kuomintang army's defense system, and entered the Kuomintang's ruling area, extending the front line to the Yangtze River area. This destroyed Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary plan to destroy the Chinese People's Liberated Areas with an anti-people civil war, and led the flames of revolution to the base area from which Chiang Kai-shek launched the anti-people civil war, thereby fundamentally shaking the Kuomintang's reactionary rule and promoting the high tide of the national people's revolutionary struggle. At the same time, the People's Liberation Army on each front, after continuously annihilating the Kuomintang army, recovered the vast majority of the liberated areas such as Northeast, Shandong, Shaanxi, and North China, and began to launch victorious attacks on the Kuomintang's strongly defended cities with populations of more than 100,000 to hundreds of thousands, annihilating tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of Kuomintang troops in each battle. In the annihilation battles against the Kuomintang, the People's Liberation Army continuously seized a large number of modern weapons to strengthen its equipment and established a powerful artillery and engineering corps. This enabled the People's Liberation Army to destroy the enemy's defense system with powerful firepower and quickly complete combat missions in subsequent siege battles and huge annihilation battles. In terms of troop replenishment, the People's Liberation Army mainly relied on prisoners of war and a large number of Kuomintang soldiers who surrendered. They came from the working class and, after education and transformation, could quickly be transformed into loyal and brave soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. Because of the above-mentioned struggles and efforts, although the People's Liberation Army had been in continuous and fierce battles from the beginning of the war, it not only did not lose and weaken its strength as American imperialism and its lackeys had hoped, but on the contrary, the strength of the People's Liberation Army grew and strengthened rapidly.
　　In November 1948, nearly two and a half years after American imperialism supported the Kuomintang reactionary clique to launch the war, another fundamental change occurred in the war situation: after nearly a hundred annihilation battles against the Kuomintang army, our People's Liberation Army achieved a great victory in the battle in western Liaoning Province in the Northeast, sweeping away the Kuomintang reactionary army in northeastern China in one fell swoop, and annihilating the majority of Chiang Kai-shek's elite troops personally equipped and trained by American imperialism. After this battle, the Kuomintang army changed from a long-term advantage in troop strength to a disadvantage, while the People's Liberation Army changed from a disadvantage in troop strength to an advantage. At that time, the total strength of the Kuomintang army had dropped to 2.9 million, while the People's Liberation Army had increased to more than 3 million. From then on, the national war situation took a sharp turn for the worse.
　　In January 1949, the Chinese People's Liberation Army victoriously completed the decisive battle against the main force of the Kuomintang army on the southern front in the vicinity of Xuzhou, annihilating seven corps of Chiang Kai-shek's elite troops, most of which were equipped with American equipment, and directly exposing Nanjing, the ruling center of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, to the front of our attacking army. During the same period, the People's Liberation Army occupied cities such as Zhangjiakou and Tianjin on the North China battlefield, and victoriously strived for the peaceful liberation of Beijing, eliminating the Kuomintang army in the North China region. Thus, after the Liaoshen Campaign, the Huaihai Campaign, and the Pingjin Campaign, the nationwide victory of the Chinese People's Revolution had been determined.
　　At this time, the remaining Kuomintang counter-revolutionary clique south of the Yangtze River, under the instigation of American imperialism, used Chiang Kai-shek's temporary retreat to the background and Li Zongren's taking the stage on his behalf to negotiate peace with the Communist Party of China as a delaying tactic, attempting to prevent the People's Liberation Army from advancing into Jiangnan, in order to realize its dream of lingering on and making a comeback. The Communist Party of China agreed to hold peace talks with the Nanjing Kuomintang government; however, the draft peace agreement jointly drafted by the Communist Party of China and the Nanjing negotiating representatives was rejected by the Nanjing Kuomintang government. Therefore, the trick of American imperialism's false "peace" was exposed.
　　On April 21, 1949, the Chinese People's Liberation Army marched south and northwest to liberate all of China. After only three days of fighting, Nanjing, the center of the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang reactionary clique's twenty-two years of reactionary rule over the people of the country, was liberated. Subsequently, from late April to the end of December, central cities such as Taiyuan, Hangzhou, Wuhan, Xi'an, Shanghai, Lanzhou, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Chengdu, and Guiyang were also liberated one after another. Hunan, Suiyuan, Xinjiang, Xikang, and Yunnan were liberated peacefully. The reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique was completely destroyed, and its remnants fled like rats to the island of Taiwan under the armed protection of the United States.
　　In 1950, the Chinese People's Liberation Army continued to liberate Hainan Island and the Zhoushan Islands, and began a victorious march into Tibet. In May 1951, representatives of the Central People's Government and the Tibetan local government signed an agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet. Now, except for Taiwan, which is still occupied by American imperialism, all of China has been liberated.
　　In nearly four years of war, the People's Liberation Army annihilated more than 8.07 million Kuomintang troops, and won over more than 1.77 million Kuomintang troops to revolt and surrender, killing and capturing 1,668 senior Kuomintang military officers, seizing more than 50,000 various artillery pieces, more than 300,000 machine guns, more than 1,000 tanks and armored vehicles, more than 20,000 vehicles, and all other weapons and equipment.
　　Obviously, this result is not insignificant for American imperialism.
　　The rapid and tragic demise of Chiang Kai-shek, the lackey of American imperialism, is not accidental. It is the inevitable end of reactionaries who ignore the will of the people and ignore the strength of the people. It is the inevitable end of adventurers who only see their temporary and superficial strength in military force and do not see their political isolation, and therefore implement opposition to the people. This is the historical judgment that should have been made long ago by Chiang Kai-shek's twenty-two years of bloody reactionary rule in China and the imperialists' more than a hundred years of bloody reactionary rule in China.
　　But the Chinese People's Liberation War is not completely over, because as mentioned above, the Taiwan Province of the People's Republic of China has not yet been liberated. In June 1950, the American aggressors, while launching a tyrannical armed intervention against Korea, announced that they would control Taiwan with force. This is a barbaric and shameless aggression similar to the Japanese imperialists' seizure of Northeast China in 1931. There is no doubt that the heroic Chinese people will definitely liberate Taiwan from American imperialism and bring the 6.7 million compatriots in Taiwan back to the embrace of the great motherland.
　　In fact, American imperialism's aggression against Taiwan is only part of the entire conspiracy plan of the United States to invade our country by force. The real purpose of the United States' aggression against Korea is to threaten Northeast China through Korea. If possible, the American aggressor army would invade our country from there, just as the Japanese imperialists did in the past. In October 1950, the American troops invading Korea surged towards our border, reaching the vicinity of the Yalu River and the Tumen River. American planes bombed and strafed our northeastern border, causing losses of life and property to our compatriots. Under this serious threat, our people had to form the Chinese People's Volunteers to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea to defend our homes and country, and fight alongside the Korean People's Army against the American aggressors. The Chinese People's Volunteers demonstrated great heroism on the front line of the anti-aggression war in Korea. Regardless of the absolute advantage of the American aggressors in aircraft, tanks, and artillery, and regardless of the difficulties caused by the brutal bombing of the American air force, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army have achieved great victories in five battles since they fought side by side on October 25, 1950. From then until June 3 this year, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese Volunteers have annihilated more than 193,000 enemy troops, including more than 89,000 American aggressor troops. The initial crazy plan of the American aggressors to occupy northern Korea and invade northeastern China was shattered, and MacArthur, the most famous aggressor in the East, was dismissed from his post in this defeat. The American aggressor army will find no way out but to withdraw from Korea. There is no doubt that the heroic Chinese people will definitely assist the Korean people in repelling aggression in order to defend the security of the northeastern border of China, and we will definitely be able to accomplish this glorious task.
　　The victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War has changed the fate of the Chinese people and changed the international status of the Chinese people. The Chinese people are using all their strength to consolidate their national defense, so that imperialist aggressors will no longer be able to do whatever they want on Chinese soil as they have done in the past 100 years. The Chinese people must make foreign governments respect our territorial sovereignty and legitimate interests, and we will definitely not tolerate American imperialism's aggression against Taiwan and Korea, as well as its plans for a separate peace treaty with Japan, long-term occupation, and rearmament. At such a time, American imperialism should especially review the history of how Chiang Kai-shek, whom it armed and commanded, was thoroughly defeated by the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Since American imperialism has not yet learned the lessons it deserves, the Chinese people must make any adventurer who learns from Chiang Kai-shek's example suffer the same shameful and tragic end as Chiang Kai-shek.

　　中国人民怎样击败了美帝国主义武装的蒋介石反动派
    朱德
    正当现在我们来纪念中国共产党英勇奋斗的三十周年的时候，中国革命已经获得了全国性的胜利。中国人民强大的敌人——帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义联合的反动统治，已被最后地推翻。一个伟大的人民民主专政的新中国，已经巩固地建立和发展起来。这是中国全部历史进入新时代的伟大胜利，同时也是继十月革命与世界反法西斯战争胜利之后，改变整个东方与世界面貌的有历史意义的伟大胜利。这个胜利大大地增强了世界和平民主阵营的力量，并且震撼了整个帝国主义的侵略阵营。
    现在，来回忆一下中国人民怎样击败了美帝国主义武装的蒋介石国民党反动派，而最后取得了全国胜利的经过情形，是有意义的。
    用马克思、列宁主义武装起来，以伟大的毛泽东同志为领袖的中国共产党，在一九二四年至一九二七年的革命失败之后，独立地领导中国人民，经过了一九二七年至一九三六年十年的国内战争，创造了一支人民革命的力量及适合中国革命斗争实际情况的政治路线与军事路线；又经过了一九三七年至一九四五年八年的抗日战争，进一步地发展并壮大了这一支人民革命的力量，并创造了约有一亿人口的解放区与一百万的人民解放军，以及二百二十万的民兵。所有这些，就是中国人民赖以战胜美帝国主义所武装的蒋介石国民党反动派的强固基础。
    第二次世界大战结束之后，世界人民迫切地要求维护和平，受过长期战争痛苦并为新的国内战争所威胁的中国人民，尤其迫切地要求实现和平。但是第二次世界大战后代替法西斯德义日地位的美帝国主义，却疯狂地推行着奴役世界的计划，以战争威胁着世界人民，并且在中国和其他地方直接制造了战争。美帝国主义虽然在一九四五年十二月莫斯科苏英美三国外长会议上同意了不干涉中国内政，并表示希望中国实现和平民主，但是在实际上，却在日本帝国主义投降之后，派遣了陆海空军与军事使团来到中国，盘据了全国多数战略要地，以大批的军事装备与战争物资供给了蒋介石卖国集团，并以各种方法帮助在抗日战争中躲在远后方的蒋介石把他的大军开到沿海大城市和反人民内战的前线，以便经过蒋介石夺取中国人民的胜利果实，变中国为美国的殖民地。蒋介石在美帝国主义支持和策动之下，全力奉行着卖国和独裁的反动政策。美帝国主义者和蒋介石反动集团，认为中国人民解放军是他们实现其反动计划的基本障碍，不消灭人民解放军就不能实现美帝国主义的侵略和蒋介石的独裁，同时认为中国共产党和中国人民要求国内和平的行为是软弱可欺的表现，认为数量较小、装备较差的中国人民解放军不堪一击，而获得美帝国主义大量援助的数百万的国民党军队则可以横行全国。因此，他们就决定在中国发动反人民的内战，仅仅为了取得时间准备这一内战，他们才暂时假装同意全国人民的和平愿望。
    在这样的形势之下，中国共产党一方面坚决地高举和平、民主、团结的旗帜，以极大的努力领导着中国人民寻求避免战争、实现和平的道路；另一方面，又动员全党和全解放区军民以至全国人民作充分的准备，以便在蒋介石坚决破坏和平时有准备地打败他的反人民反革命的军事进攻。中国共产党代表了广大人民的要求，连续地发出了关于和平、民主、团结的多次号召；毛泽东同志亲往重庆与蒋介石进行和平谈判；迫使蒋介石发布了停战令；召开了各党派政治协商会议，成立了有国民党政府代表参加并举手通过的关于实现和平民主团结的决议。所有这些步骤，都是完全符合于广大人民为争取国内和平、民主、团结的要求的。由于中国共产党在这一场剧烈的斗争中采取了坚定的大公无私的正义立场，由于蒋介石及其主人美帝国主义在中国人民面前再三地暴露了他们的背信弃义，暴露了他们一手“调处”内战冲突，一手积极布置内战的阴谋诡计，所以广大人民得以从自己的切身经验中，消除了对美帝国主义及蒋介石反动派的幻想。因此，当美帝国主义及蒋介石国民党反动派觉得他们已经完成反人民、反革命大规模的内战准备的时候，他们在政治上也就孤立起来，失掉全国人民的同情了。
    一九四六年七月初，蒋介石在美国大力援助之下，不顾全中国人民和全世界民主舆论的反对，向人民解放军发起了中国历史上空前的全面的大内战。这个内战的初期的形势，对于中国人民曾经是严重的。世界上一个最大的帝国主义竭力支持着世界上一个最大的卖国贼集团。蒋介石卖国集团当时有总兵力四百三十万，有由美帝国主义供应的价值六十亿美元左右的飞机、大炮、坦克等等近代装备与物资，有三亿数千万以上人口的统治区，有大城市和丰富资源，有近代工业与近代交通条件。而中国人民解放军方面，当时的兵力还不及国民党军的三分之一，装备与资源更居劣势，解放区也还只有不及蒋介石统治区三分之一的人口。在双方军事力量的对比上，除了人民解放军的政治素质及与人民的联系优于蒋介石之外，其他各方面的条件，都处于劣势。因此，蒋介石敢于在战争一开始就动用正规军一百八十万的兵力，声势汹汹，向东北、中原、华东、华北各解放区全面地发动进攻，企图一举消灭人民解放军。但是正如毛泽东同志所说：“中国共产党依据马克思、列宁主义的科学，清醒地估计了国际与国内的形势，知道一切国内外反动派的进攻，不但是必须打败的，而且是能够打败的。”“敌人军事力量的优势，这只是暂时的现象，这只是临时起作用的因素；美帝国主义的援助，也只是临时起作用的因素；而蒋介石战争的反人民的性质，人心的向背，则是经常起作用的因素；而在这方面，人民解放军则占着优势。人民解放军的战争所具有的爱国的正义的革命的性质，必然要获得全国人民的拥护。这就是战胜蒋介石的政治基础。”战争的进程和结局，充分地证明了毛泽东同志这一论断的正确。
    中国共产党与人民解放军根据毛泽东同志这一科学的分析与论断，一方面紧紧地团结解放区的广大人民以及全国的广大人民，从物质上和精神上来支援这个规模巨大的人民革命战争；另一方面，又坚决地执行了毛泽东同志所亲自规定的集中绝对优势兵力、各个歼灭敌人的军事指导路线，同时在军队中充分地实行了团结人民群众、团结官兵与瓦解敌军、改造俘虏等项革命的政治工作，所以我们就能从人民解放战争中不断地削弱国民党军而壮大自己，夺取国民党军的武装而武装自己。在蒋介石发动全面进攻，侵入我各解放区的战争初期，我们虽然丧失了很多城市和广大的乡村，但人民解放军平均每月歼灭国民党军约为八个旅的有生力量。经过八个月，由于蒋介石兵力有很大削弱，就迫使蒋介石放弃了全面进攻，而只能在战线的两翼，即山东和陕北，举行所谓“重点进攻”。蒋介石用以进攻山东解放区的兵力约为其进攻总兵力的三分之一即六十个旅，而进攻陕北解放区的敌军则相当于当地人民解放军的十倍。但是由于人民解放军在每次作战时实行了集中绝对优势兵力，各个歼灭敌人的正确的战略方针，而不以保守城市或地方为主要目标，所以中国人民解放军不但迅速地粉碎了蒋介石的“重点进攻”，而且在此时期就在东北和华北战场上对蒋介石举行了局部的反攻。
    到战争的第一年度结束，人民解放军已歼灭了敌人九十七个半旅，一百一十二万人，而使自己的正规军由一百二、三十万发展成为二百万。战争形势由此发生了根本的变化：丧失了巨大的有生力量的蒋介石卖国集团，不得不从战略的进攻转为战略的防御了。
    从中国人民解放战争的第二年度开始，中国人民解放军即由战略的防御转为战略的进攻。这是一个有关中国人民革命历史的全局性的变化。毛泽东同志当时曾经宣告：“这是蒋介石二十年反革命统治由发展到消灭的转折点。这是一百多年以来帝国主义在中国的统治由发展到消灭的转折点。”在向蒋介石反动派的进攻中，人民解放军大军南渡黄河，粉碎了国民党军的防御体系，打入了国民党的统治区，把战线伸展到长江一带。这就破坏了蒋介石以反人民内战毁灭中国人民解放区的反革命计划，而把革命的火焰引向蒋介石发动反人民内战的根据地，从而在根本上撼动了国民党的反动统治，推进了全国人民革命斗争的高潮。同时，各线的人民解放军又于连续地歼灭国民党军之后，收复了东北、山东、陕北和华北等解放区的绝大部分，并开始了对有十余万以至数十万人口的国民党强大设防城市举行胜利的攻坚战，每役歼灭数万以至十数万的国民党军。人民解放军在对国民党歼灭战中，不断地缴获了大量的近代化武器以增强自己的装备，建立起强大的炮兵和工兵，这就使人民解放军在以后的攻坚战和巨大的歼灭战中，能够以强大的火力摧毁敌人的防御体系，迅速完成战斗任务，在兵员补充上，人民解放军主要地依靠俘虏和投降过来的大批国民党军的士兵。他们出身于劳动阶级，经过教育改造，就可以迅速转变为人民解放军忠勇的战士。因为经过以上的种种斗争和努力，所以人民解放军虽然从战争一开始就处在连续的激烈的战斗中，但是不仅没有像美帝国主义及其走狗所期望的那样因此丧失和削弱了自己的力量，而且恰恰相反，人民解放军的力量却迅速地增长和壮大起来了。
    一九四八年的十一月，即美帝国主义支持国民党反动派发动战争之后将近两年半的时候，战争形势发生了另一个根本变化：我人民解放军经过近百次的对国民党军的歼灭战役之后，在东北辽宁省西部的战役中取得了巨大的胜利，一举扫清了中国东北部的国民党反动派的军队，歼灭了美帝国主义亲自装备训练的蒋介石精锐部队的大部。经过这次战役，国民党军就从长期兵力上的优势变为劣势，而人民解放军则从兵力上的劣势转成优势。当时国民党军总兵力已降为二百九十万人，人民解放军则增至三百余万人。从此以后，全国战局即急转直下。
    一九四九年一月，中国人民解放军又在徐州附近地区胜利地完成了对于南线国民党军主力的决战，歼灭了大部分由美械装备的蒋介石精锐部队七个兵团，并使蒋介石卖国集团的统治中心——南京直接暴露在我进攻大军的面前。在同一时期，人民解放军在华北战场又占领了张家口、天津等城市，并胜利地争取了北京的和平解放，肃清了华北地区的国民党军。这样，经过了辽沈战役，淮海战役和京津战役，中国人民革命的全国性的胜利局面，就已经确定了。
    在这个时候，长江以南的残余的国民党反革命集团，在美帝国主义指使之下，用蒋介石暂时退到后台、李宗仁代而登台向中国共产党谈判和平的缓兵之计，企图阻止人民解放军进军江南，以遂其苟延残喘、卷土重来的梦想。中国共产党同意了与南京国民党政府进行和平谈判；但是中国共产党与南京的谈判代表经过谈判所共同起草的和平协定的草案，却被南京国民党政府所拒绝。因此，美帝国主义的假“和平”的诡计就被揭穿了。
    一九四九年四月二十一日，中国人民解放军向南方和西北进军，以解放全中国。仅仅经过三天的战斗，就解放了蒋介石国民党反动派对全国人民进行了二十二年反动统治的中心——南京。随后，从四月下旬到十二月底，太原、杭州、武汉、西安、上海、兰州、广州、重庆、成都、贵阳等中心城市也相继解放。湖南、绥远、新疆、西康、云南等地则以和平办法获得了解放。蒋介石卖国集团的反动统治完全灭亡了，它的残余像老鼠一样地逃到了在美国武装保护下的台湾岛。
    一九五○年，中国人民解放军继续解放了海南岛和舟山群岛，并向西藏开始了胜利的进军。一九五一年五月，中央人民政府与西藏地方政府代表签定了和平解放西藏办法的协定。现在，除了台湾一处还受着美帝国主义霸占以外，全中国都已经解放了。
    在将近四年的战争中，人民解放军消灭了国民党军八百零七万多人，争取国民党军起义和投诚改编共有一百七十七万多人，击毙和俘掳国民党军高级军官一千六百六十八人，缴获各种炮五万多门，机枪三十多万挺，坦克与装甲车一千多辆，汽车二万多辆，以及其他所有的武器和装备。
    很明显，这个结果，对于美帝国主义并不是无足轻重的。
    美帝国主义走狗蒋介石的如此迅速的和悲惨的覆亡，不是偶然的，这是忽视人民意志、忽视人民力量的反动派的必然的结局，这是只看见自己在武力上暂时的表面的强大，而看不见自己在政治上的孤立，因而实行反对人民的冒险家的必然的结局。这是蒋介石在中国二十二年血腥反动统治和帝国主义者在中国一百多年血腥反动统治所早已应当作出的历史的裁判。
    但是中国人民解放战争还没有完全结束，因为如上所说，中华人民共和国的领土台湾省还没有解放。一九五○年六月，美国侵略者在发起了对于朝鲜的横暴的武装干涉同时，宣布以武力控制我国的台湾。这是和日本帝国主义在一九三一年夺取我国东北同类的野蛮无耻的侵略。毫无疑问，英勇的中国人民一定要从美帝国主义手中解放台湾，使台湾的六百七十万同胞回到伟大祖国的怀抱。
    事实上美帝国主义对于台湾的侵略还只是美国以武力侵略我国的整个阴谋计划的一部分。美国侵略朝鲜的真正目的，就在经过朝鲜来威胁我国的东北，只要有可能，美国侵略军就会从那里侵入我国，像过去日本帝国主义所作过的一样。一九五○年十月，美国侵略朝鲜的军队就曾经向我国边境汹涌前进，直到鸭绿江边和图们江的附近。美国飞机轰炸扫射我国东北边境，使我国同胞遭受生命财产的损失。在这种严重威胁下，我国人民不得不组成抗美援朝保家卫国志愿军与朝鲜人民军并肩向美国侵略者作战。我国人民志愿军在朝鲜反侵略前线表现了极大的英勇。不顾美国侵略者在飞机、坦克、大炮等方面占绝对的优势，不顾美国空军残酷轰炸所造成的困难，我国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军从一九五○年十月二十五日并肩作战以来，却已经在五次战役中取得了伟大的胜利。从那时到今年六月三日为止，朝鲜人民军和中国志愿军已经歼灭了敌军十九万三千多人，包括美国侵略军八万九千多人。美国侵略者占领朝鲜北部并侵入我国东北的最初的疯狂计划被粉碎了，美国在东方最著名的侵略罪魁麦克阿瑟在这个失败中被撤职了。美国侵略军除开从朝鲜撤退以外，是找不到旁的出路的。毫无疑问，英勇的中国人民一定要协助朝鲜人民击退侵略，以保卫中国东北边境的安全，而我们也一定能够完成这个光荣的任务。
    中国人民解放战争的胜利，已经改变了中国人民的命运，改变了中国人民在国际上的地位。中国人民正在用一切力量巩固自己的国防，不让帝国主义侵略者再像过去一百多年中那样地在中国土地上为所欲为。中国人民一定要使外国政府尊重我们的领土主权和正当利益，而一定不能容忍美帝国主义对台湾和朝鲜的侵略，以及对于日本的单独媾和、长期占领和重新武装的计划。在这样的时候，美帝国主义特别应当温习一下它所武装和指挥的蒋介石怎样被中国人民和中国人民解放军所彻底击败的历史。美帝国主义既然还没有学到应得的教训，那么，中国人民就一定要使学着蒋介石榜样的任何冒险家遭受与蒋介石同样可耻的悲惨的结局。
