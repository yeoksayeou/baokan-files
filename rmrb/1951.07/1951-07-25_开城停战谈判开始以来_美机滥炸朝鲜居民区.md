　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 23rd (TASS): Since the armistice talks began in Kaesong, the US Air Force has continuously intensified its attacks on residential areas. US planes bomb cities and villages day and night, strafing roads and rice paddies. Pyongyang is subjected to barbaric bombing every day. Dozens of US planes attacked Anju, Sariwon, Nampo, Sunan (transliteration), and other cities. US warships also shelled the ruins of Wonsan.
　　US jet fighters are bombing highways and rice paddies where farmers are working every day. They dropped napalm bombs and time bombs on residential areas. In South Pyongan Province and Hwanghae Province, hundreds of peaceful residents have been killed and injured due to the thuggish US air raids. In the past three days, American aerial bandits, using dense clouds as cover, indiscriminately dropped bombs on Pyongyang, Hwangju, Sariwon, and Sunan (transliteration).

　　开城停战谈判开始以来
　  美机滥炸朝鲜居民区
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社平壤二十三日电：自从停战谈判在开城开始以来，美国空军不断加紧袭击居民地区。美国飞机不分昼夜地轰炸城市和乡村，扫射公路和稻田。平壤每天都受到野蛮的轰炸。几十架美国飞机袭击安州、沙里院、南浦，顺安（译音）和其他城市。美国军舰也发炮轰击元山的废墟。
    美国喷气战斗机每天都在轰炸公路和有农民们在耕作的稻田。它们对居民区投下了凝固汽油弹和定时炸弹。在平安南道和黄海道，由于美国强盗般的空袭，几百个和平居民被杀害和受伤。在最近三天中，美国的空中强盗利用密云作掩护，对平壤、黄州、沙里院和顺安（译音）乱投炸弹。
