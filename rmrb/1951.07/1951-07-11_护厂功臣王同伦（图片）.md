    Factory-Protecting Hero Wang Tonglun
    By Yang Boda
    (Ten) At 1:20 AM on May 10th, Wang Tonglun was observing the electric roller temperature, preparing to start the machine, when he came on shift; workers in the calendering workshop were holding a meeting to discuss problems. The lights suddenly went out.
    (Eleven) Wang Tonglun quickly went around the iron plate and saw a figure at the door. He was about to ask who it was when two people darted out from the side. One grabbed his throat, and the other smashed the only light in the room – the indicator light.
    (Twelve) Wang Tonglun understood everything at this point, and he fought desperately with the special agents. The special agents wanted to pour oil on the electric roller in an attempt to burn the machine. Wang Tonglun was gagged by another special agent and couldn't shout, but he finally snatched the oil barrel away, and the oil spilled on the ground.

    护厂功臣王同伦
    杨伯达 作
    （十）五月十日上午一点二十分，王同伦上班时正观察电滚温度，准备开车；压延车间工人这时正在开会讨论问题。电灯突然灭了。
    （十一）王同伦急忙绕过铁板，发现门口有人影，他正要问是谁，这时从旁边窜过来两个人，一个掐住了他的喉咙；另一个打碎了全屋唯一的光亮——标志灯。
    （十二）王同伦这时明白了一切，他拚命和特务博斗。特务想用油往电滚上浇，企图烧毁机器，王同伦这时被另一特务堵住嘴，喊不出声来；但终于把油桶抢下，油都洒在地上。
