Xinhua News Agency Report: Commanders and fighters of the Central South Military Region and the Fourth Field Army held discussion meetings and reminiscence evenings to commemorate the 14th anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War. Some units also held small-scale accusation meetings. Li Changfa, deputy battalion commander of a certain unit, recounted the brutality of the Japanese invaders in his hometown of a certain place in Shandong. The Japanese invaders burned down sixteen villages near his hometown, massacred more than 120 people, and stabbed his father and brother to death, leaving his family destroyed. He said, "We cannot let the dark days of the past return! We cannot allow American imperialism to rearm Japan, we must defend the victory and happiness we have gained through hard work!" Zhou Zhengji, a soldier from a certain unit who has been awarded three major merits and is from Wanping County, Hebei Province, recalled the situation when the Japanese invaders launched an attack on his hometown on July 7, 1937, and said, "Now I am a soldier defending the motherland. Recalling the past disasters, I resolutely oppose the United States arming Japan." Sun Lixue, the company commander of the 7th Company of a certain unit stationed in Wuhan, was a militiaman during the War of Resistance against Japan. He used landmines to overturn two Japanese military vehicles and killed seven Japanese devils. He recalled the difficult situation more than ten years ago and said, "Although it has been more than ten years, the scene of my eldest brother being buried alive, and the tragic scene of the Japanese devils cutting my sister-in-law's breasts with bayonets, are all still vivid in my mind. The blood debt owed by the Japanese invaders has not yet been repaid, and American imperialism is about to arm Japan again. I will definitely lead the whole company to practice hard to defend the motherland." After the discussion and accusation of the atrocities of the Japanese invaders in invading China, the broad masses of commanders and fighters unanimously and resolutely expressed their opposition to the United States' separate peace treaty with Japan, and approved of the Soviet Union's note and memorandum on the Japanese peace treaty issue. The military region and the field army will hold separate meetings on the 7th, and the leaders of each unit will report to the commanders and fighters. At that time, each company will organize newspaper reading and current affairs speeches.
