　　The Chinese Communist Party and Me
　　Professor of Yenching University Hou Renzhi
　　While celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, I deeply feel that the Party has not only led our motherland onto the path of new life, but also led me personally onto the path of new life.

　　Under the leadership of the Party, I realized from the bottom of my heart that I must be thoroughly reformed—not only must my thinking be thoroughly reformed, but even my academic research work, which I have always regarded as my "second life," must also be thoroughly reformed. This was something I could never have dreamed of a year and a half ago, but now it has become the most real, most concrete, and most fundamental thing for me. For myself, this is truly a great "revolution," the result of the Party's direct and indirect, patient enlightenment and education.

　　A year and a half ago, I had just returned from Europe to the liberated motherland, and seeing the vigorous development of the new atmosphere of the motherland, I had endless excitement and joy. But at that time, I never thought that my own thinking and professional work needed to be thoroughly reformed; because at that time, I felt that my thinking was progressive, my intentions were upright, and I was confident in my own research work. I thought: since the reactionaries have been completely defeated, and the people's democratic power has been firmly established, what else could I ask for? I only hope to firmly guard my post, steadfastly, wouldn't that be able to work "smoothly" from now on? What other problems could arise? However, serious problems arose right here!

　　At first, I heard that the thinking of intellectuals had to be reformed, and the courses in schools had to be reformed. I thought that it was talking about the thinking of other intellectuals to be reformed, and the courses of other teachers to be reformed, and that I was not included. I didn't feel at all that there was anything in my own thinking that needed to be reformed, or anything in my own courses that needed to be reformed. However, in the various kinds of learning over the past year and a half, under the Party's direct and indirect education, I gradually became aware. I began to realize that my origin, my education, and even the training I received in specialized academics, could only enable me to live more appropriately in a narrow world centered on myself, engage in personal, self-proclaimed noble and detached "academic research" and be complacent, but could never enable me to live in a infinitely bright and infinitely vast world dominated by the broad masses of the people, and undertake my due work and be competent and happy. This is just like a person who has long been accustomed to living in his own dark room, if he once enters the brilliant sunshine, not only can't see the light of the sun, but instead feels the glare of the sun; not only doesn't feel the vastness of the outside world, but instead feels that his surroundings are empty and out of reach. The workers who have turned over, the peasants after the land reform can use incomparable emotion and incomparable excitement to sing: "The Communist Party is like the sun, shining wherever it shines..."; but I can only recite its lyrics, learn its tunes, and cannot comprehend the simple and ardent emotions it conveys. But the Party gave me the opportunity to visit the land reform. After returning from the land reform, the above situation changed rapidly for me. Because in the land reform I established the viewpoint of class for the first time in actual life, and was infected with the emotions of class; in the land reform I saw the "sun" for the first time in the broad masses, and no longer could only see the "small lamp" on my desk. -- "The sun" can shine on all the oppressed and exploited working people, but the "small lamp" on my desk can only shine on myself. From this time on, I was determined to throw away the "small lamp" on my desk that could only shine on myself, jump out of the small house I had always been accustomed to, I want to follow the broad masses of working people, rush into the bright sunshine, and sing with them in the same voice and with the same emotions: "The Communist Party is like the sun, shining there, there is bright..."! I have discovered an infinitely vast world, I can no longer return to the small house I originally thought was appropriate and comfortable; I have seen the incomparable light of the sun, I can no longer return to the darkness! The world of the working people is my vast world, and the Chinese Communist Party is the sun I saw for the first time in the broad masses! It gave me new meaning in life, it gave me a new life.

　　In recent days, I have seen in the newspapers that worker brothers and farmer brothers, in order to welcome the thirtieth anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party, enthusiastically presented their brilliant achievements in labor production to Chairman Mao and the Communist Party as a gift to the Party. I myself feel very ashamed; because although I have felt the Party's concern and education for me in the past year and a half, I cannot produce anything concrete as a gift to celebrate the Party's thirtieth birthday. I can only take this opportunity to explain the process of my own initial awakening after accepting the Party's education, and I guarantee to continue to develop this process, and to rely on further learning of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and on the Party's tireless leadership and education, to more thoroughly transform my own thinking and work. Finally, I would also like to take this opportunity to express my utmost gratitude and respect to the comrades in the Party who are relatively close to me in work and therefore have helped me more directly.

### 中国共产党和我

　　中国共产党和我
    燕京大学教授  侯仁之
    在庆祝中国共产党成立三十周年的时候，使我深深地感到党不但领导我们的祖国走上了新生的道路，而且也领导我个人走上了新生的道路。
    在党的领导下，我从心里认识了我自己是必须彻底改造的——不但是我的思想必须彻底改造，就是我一向认为自己“第二生命”的学术研究工作，也必须彻底改造。这是我一年半以前做梦也想不到的事，现在却对我成了最真实、最具体、最基本的事。对我自己说，这真是一个大“革命”，是党的直接间接耐心启发教育的结果。
    一年半以前，我刚从欧洲回到解放后的祖国，眼看着祖国蓬勃发展的新气象，真是有说不尽的兴奋，说不尽的快乐。但是我那时决没有想到我自己的思想和业务还需要彻底改造；因为那时我觉得自己的思想是进步的，存心是正直的，对自己的研究工作是有自信的。我想：反动派既然彻底被打垮了，人民的民主政权也巩固地被建立起来了，我还有什么要求呢？我只希望能够确守自己的岗位，坚定不移，岂不是就可以从此以后“一帆风顺”地工作下去了吗？还会有什么问题发生呢？可是，严重的问题就在这里发生了！
    最初我听说知识分子的思想要改造，学校里的课程要改革，我以为那都是说的别的知识分子的思想要改造，别的教员的课程要改革，我自己并不包括在内。我一点也不觉得我自己的思想有什么需要改造的地方，我自己的课程有什么需要改革的地方。可是，在这一年半的各式各样的学习中，在党的直接间接的教育下，我渐渐地觉悟了。我开始认识到我的出身，我的教养，以至于我在专门学术上所受的训练，都只能使我比较妥贴地生活在一个以自我为中心的局促狭小的天地中，弄弄个人自以为清高的超然的“学术研究”而沾沾自喜，却决不能使我生活在一个以广大人民为主的无限光明无限远大的大世界中，担当起我应有的工作而胜任愉快。这正如一个久已习惯了在自己阴暗的斗室中生活着的人，如果一旦走入了灿烂的阳光下，非但看不见太阳的光明，反而觉得太阳的刺目；非但不觉得外面世界的辽阔广大，反而觉得自己的四周空虚摸不着边际是一样的。翻身的工人、土地改革后的农民可以用无比的情感无比的兴奋去歌唱：“共产党像太阳，照到那儿，那儿亮………”，我却只能背诵背诵它的歌辞，学习学习它的调子，而不能对它所传达的纯朴热烈的感情有所体会。但是党给了我参观土地改革的机会，在参观土地改革回来之后，上述的情形就对我迅速地改变起来。因为在土地改革中我第一次在实际的生活里建立了阶级的观点，感染了阶级的感情；在土地改革中我第一次在广大的群众中看见了“太阳”，而不再是只能看见我自己书桌上的那盏“小灯”。——“太阳”可以照耀着一切被压迫被剥削的劳动人民，我书桌上的那盏“小灯”却只能照耀着我自己。从这时起我就决心再甩掉我书桌上那盏只能照耀着我自己的“小灯”，跳出我自己一向习惯了的小房子，我要追随着广大的劳动人民，冲入光明灿烂的阳光里，要和他们用一样的声音，一样的感情，来高唱：“共产党像太阳，照到那里，那里亮……”！我已经发现了一个辽阔无比的大世界，我不能再回到原先我那个自以为妥贴舒适的小房子中去了；我已经看见了太阳的无比的光明，我不能再回到黑暗中去了！劳动人民的世界就是我辽阔广大的世界，中国共产党就是我平生第一次在广大的群众中看到的太阳！它给了我新的人生意义，它给了我新的生活。
    连日在报纸上看见工人兄弟农民兄弟们为了迎接中国共产党的三十周年纪念，热烈地向毛主席，向共产党，提出了他们劳动生产的辉煌成绩，作为对于党的献礼。我自己觉得非常惭愧；因为我虽然处处感觉到在过去一年半的时期中党对于我的种种关切，种种教育，我却拿不出任何具体的东西来作为庆祝党的三十岁的生日的献礼。我只有借这机会说明在接受了党的教育之后我自己一个初步觉悟的过程，而且保证要把这个过程继续发展下去，要把自己的思想和业务依靠了对于马克思列宁主义毛泽东思想更进一步的学习，依靠了党的不倦的领导和教育，更彻底地改造起来。最后，也愿意借此机会向党内在工作上比较和我接近因而也比较更多地更直接地帮助了我的同志们，表示无尚的感激和敬意。
