　　US Draft of a One-Sided Peace Treaty with Japan
　  Opposed by the Philippine People
    Xinhua News Agency, 22nd dispatch: The American-made one-sided draft peace treaty with Japan is even facing widespread opposition in the Philippines. TASS New York Dispatch: According to the New York Times correspondent in Manila, the "Liberal Youth League," which is associated with the Quirino government, held a grand demonstration of five thousand people in Manila on the 17th, under the intense emotion of the Philippine people opposing the American draft peace treaty with Japan. They burned the portrait of Dulles, the drafter of the American draft peace treaty with Japan and a notorious war-monger, in the central square to protest the American draft peace treaty with Japan.
    The reporter said: The Philippine Council of State approved Quirino's attitude of opposing the American draft treaty.
    As everyone knows, Quirino opposes this draft because the draft does not stipulate Japanese reparations to the Philippines and does not guarantee the security of the Philippines.

　　美制片面对日和约草案
　  遭到菲律宾人民反对
    【新华社二十二日讯】美国片面制订的对日和约草案，甚至在菲律宾也遭到普遍的反对。塔斯社纽约讯：据纽约时报驻马尼拉记者报道，与季里诺政府有联系的“自由青年联盟”，在菲律宾人民反对美国对日和约草案的激昂情绪下，十七日在马尼拉举行了五千人的盛大示威游行，并在中央广场上焚毁美国对日和约草案起草人、著名的战争贩子杜勒斯的肖像，表示抗议美国的对日和约草案。
    该记者说：菲律宾国务会议批准了季里诺反对美国和约草案的态度。
    大家知道，季里诺所以反对这一草案，是因为草案里没有规定日本对菲律宾赔偿，并且没有保证菲律宾的安全。
