The exhibition's preparatory committee, under the auspices of the North China Affairs Department, was established in Tianjin on the 10th of this month. The preparatory committee is composed of 47 responsible cadres from the financial and economic committees, commercial departments, industrial and commercial bureaus, and cooperatives of the five provinces and two cities of North China and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, as well as labor models from industry and agriculture, representatives from industry and commerce, and representatives of ethnic minorities, all invited by the North China Affairs Department. Huang Jing, the Mayor of Tianjin, was appointed as the chairman, and Li Zheren, the Deputy Director of the Financial and Economic Work Committee of the North China Bureau of the CCP Central Committee, and Li Gengtao, the Deputy Director of the Tianjin Financial and Economic Committee, were appointed as the vice-chairmen. The preparatory committee has set up a general office and eight committees for exhibition collection and arrangement, site architectural design, publicity, finance, safety and hygiene, material exchange, liaison and reception, and evaluation. These institutions will begin operations on the 15th of this month.
    At the inaugural meeting of the preparatory committee on the 10th of this month, Li Zheren, Deputy Director of the Financial and Economic Work Committee of the North China Bureau, gave a report on the draft work plan for the exhibition.
    Mayor Huang Jing of Tianjin then spoke. He said: With the direct leadership of the North China Affairs Department and the active participation of responsible cadres of financial and economic work in various provinces and cities, we are confident that we can successfully hold the exhibition. He also instructed Tianjin to do its best in the preparatory work. How many people the preparatory committee needs, Tianjin will provide; what the preparatory committee needs to do, Tianjin will do.
    Representatives from various regions conducted group discussions and finally adopted the exhibition work plan, the main points of which are as follows:
    I. Tasks
    Strengthening urban-rural material exchange is one of the six major tasks in North China in 1951. In order to further accomplish this task, it has been decided to hold the "North China Region Urban-Rural Material Exchange Exhibition" in Tianjin this autumn. Its tasks are:
    1. Vigorously promote the sales of agricultural, sideline, special, and handicraft products, medicinal materials, aquatic products, and livestock and mineral products. The exhibition venue is the market. During the exhibition, we must actively solicit business, sign various contracts and agreements, and use this to organize the material exchange between urban and rural areas, between provinces, between North China and other major regions, and between China and foreign countries this autumn and winter and next spring. Consolidate existing commercial networks, develop new commercial networks, and establish regular trade relations with all parties. This is the main task.
    2. The exhibition of industrial products should focus on industrial and handicraft products needed by the urban and rural people for production and life, so as to increase output, reduce costs, further expand sales, and promote the development of industrial production.
    3. Ascertain and publicize the origin, output, production period, uses, specifications, prices, sales channels, and other information of various products, so as to promote sales in a planned manner and enable visitors to obtain a clear direction of what industry and agriculture need to produce and how to improve production.
    4. Introduce the creations of labor models in industry and agriculture and the achievements of industrial and commercial improvements, organize and invite labor people, cooperatives, and representatives of public and private industrial and commercial enterprises to visit the exhibition, and organize various forums and get-togethers during the meeting to increase everyone's enthusiasm for production and management, and enable urban agricultural scientists and the broad masses of farmers to learn from each other and jointly obtain the opportunity to combine theory and practice.
    5. The entire exhibition must fully reflect the policy of considering all aspects and the spirit of the city leading the countryside, industry leading agriculture, workers leading farmers, and the worker-peasant alliance. In particular, the spirit of patriotism must be permeated into every exhibition hall of the conference, so that visitors can experience the superiority of the new Chinese political system, thereby enhancing everyone's enthusiasm for loving the motherland.
    II. Scope and Content
    The collection of exhibits should focus on the five provinces and two cities of North China and Inner Mongolia. Agricultural products: including agricultural products, sideline products, mountain goods, medicinal materials, aquatic products, special products, livestock products, etc. Industrial products: mainly products from Tianjin, and those from other provinces and cities with exhibition value should also be collected to participate. Handicraft products: the five provinces and two cities should select major or famous products (such as Beijing handicrafts, Anping horsehair cloth, Pingyuan straw braid, Shanxi Fenjiu, etc.) to be sent to the exhibition. The collection of exhibits must combine comprehensiveness and focus. And it must be products with a larger output; those with too little output can be excluded, and high-quality varieties with guiding significance and unsalable products can be collected with attention to prevent a general exhibition. Products from other regions that are needed by North China are also welcome to participate. The typical deeds of labor models in industry and agriculture in various parts of North China and industrial and commercial improvements should be widely collected, sorted out, and sent.
    In addition to setting up separate pavilions for other places, the products of various provinces and cities in North China will be exhibited in unified pavilions according to their nature. The pavilions will be divided by region for comparison, roughly divided into seven categories of exhibitions:
    1. Agricultural products: divided into grain, beans, cotton, flax, tobacco leaves, oil crops, and other crops.
    2. Local and special products: divided into mountain goods, medicinal materials, dried and fresh goods, aquatic products, livestock products, and other special products.
    3. Industrial products: divided into agricultural tools, hardware, machinery, cotton products, chemical industrial products (including insecticides, chemical dyes, rubber products, papermaking, and other chemical industries, etc.), food industry, handicraft products, and handicrafts.
    4. Mineral products: divided into metals, fuels, asbestos, natural alkali, and other minerals.
    5. Creations of labor models: their deeds will be distributed and exhibited in various pavilions according to their nature, striving to highlight them.
    6. Industrial and commercial improvements: mainly comparing the production and management effects before and after the improvements, a special pavilion is required.
    7. Prevention and control of pests and diseases: introducing the achievements and experiences of the people of North China in conducting large-scale struggles against disasters such as water, drought, insects, hail, and jaundice in agriculture under the leadership of the People's Government over the years.
    8. Comprehensive exhibition: This pavilion systematically introduces the overall economic situation of North China and the entire picture of material exchange between urban and rural areas and between domestic and foreign ports. The layout of all exhibits must be systematic, popular, artistic, with a clear purpose, prominent center, clear explanation, and simple and generous, showing the victory of our country's economic struggle against imperialist countries and the development and importance of our country's trade relations with the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries.
    Various models or specimens should be able to move as much as possible. Various machines, agricultural tools, etc., should be able to be demonstrated or tested on the spot as much as possible.
