	Farmers' Patriotic Enthusiasm Increases
	Successful Summer Grain Collection Work in Western Sichuan
	Xinhua News Agency: The summer grain collection in the Western Sichuan area has been mostly stored in warehouses. As of late June, the entire area had completed more than 80% of the summer grain collection task. The summer grain collection work in more than ten counties, including Meishan and Jiajiang, has been fully completed.
	The increase in farmers' patriotic enthusiasm is the main reason for the rapid and smooth progress of this year's summer grain collection work in the Western Sichuan area. Farmers believe that this is "paying patriotic grain" and "paying emancipation grain," so all the grain paid is dried and winnowed clean. In Xiaogan Township, Deyang County, all the summer grain that should be paid this year was paid in one day.
	In order to protect the grain entering the warehouses, farmers in various places have organized warehouse protection committees. People's armed forces in various places, including militia and self-defense forces, have also strengthened their guard work on the granaries, closely preventing sabotage by counter-revolutionary elements.

　　农民爱国热情提高
    川西夏征工作顺利
    川西区夏征公粮已大部入仓。截至六月下旬，全区已完成夏征任务百分之八十以上，眉山、夹江等十多县的夏征工作，都已经全部完成。
    农民爱国热情的提高，是今年川西区夏征工作迅速顺利进行的主要原因。农民认为这是“缴爱国粮”，“缴翻身粮”，所以凡缴的公粮，都晒得干，扬得净。德阳县孝感乡一天之内，就缴完了今夏应缴的全部公粮。
    为保护入仓的公粮，各地农民已组织了保仓、护仓委员会。各地人民武装，包括民兵和自卫队亦加强了他们对粮仓的警卫工作，严密地防范着反革命分子的破坏。
