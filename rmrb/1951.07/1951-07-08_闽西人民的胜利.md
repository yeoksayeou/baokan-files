　　The Victory of the People of Western Fujian
　　Wang Shuren
　　The Western Fujian Revolutionary Base is located in the mountainous area of southwestern Fujian, including the counties of Longyan, Yongding, Shanghang, Changting, Wuping, Liancheng, and Zhangping, with a population of over one million. For a long period, this area was connected with the Jiangxi Central Revolutionary Base, becoming part of the Central Revolutionary Base at the time. The famous "Gutian Conference" was held in Gutian, Shanghang. After the main force of the Red Army went north to resist Japan, the people of Western Fujian, under the leadership of the local party, persisted in the struggle for seventeen years, and later, in coordination with the southward army, liberated more than ten cities including Shantou, Meixian, Longyan, and Shanghang, until the entire territory of Fujian was liberated.
　　As early as 1927, under the leadership of the Communist Party, secret peasant associations were established in some areas of Western Fujian. In 1928, under the leadership of the Party, the peasants of Western Fujian first launched uprisings in Jinsha in Yongding, Baituo in Longyan, and Jiaoyang in Shanghang. Hundreds of peasants used bird guns, machetes, pitchforks, and nine-section whips as weapons to attack the county towns of Longyan and Yongding. These uprisings shook the entire Western Fujian and raised the consciousness of the peasants. In April 1929, the Fourth Army of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, led by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, entered Western Fujian from Jiangxi. The peasants of Western Fujian used uprisings to welcome their leaders. The scale of the uprisings was very large. According to the peasants who participated in the uprising at the time: It was like "burning the mountains," from Changting to Longyan, to Yongding, Shanghang... The flames of revolution burned all over the mountains and valleys of Western Fujian. The slogans "Down with the local tyrants, divide the land" were written on the walls of villages, and the land and property of landlords and despots were confiscated and distributed to poor peasants according to law. In Longyan, Yongding, Wuping and other counties, more than 800,000 peasants were distributed land. Revolutionary committees and workers' and peasants' governments were then established. Even now, when the peasants talk about the uprising that year, everyone is beaming and radiant. Qiu Maorong, a sixty-year-old from Leige Village, Longyan, said: "At that time, we were so happy that we couldn't sleep... At that time, everyone had a piece of red cloth, some hung on their chests, some buttoned on their buttons... At that time, most women cut their hair, unbound their feet, and participated in meetings, guarding posts, and drills. The feudal system of thousands of years was broken... At that time, we lived a very good life. At that time, we first knew that we had our own army and party, which were the Red Army and the Communist Party..."
　　After the Red Army went north to resist Japan in 1934, the Kuomintang bandit gangs successively mobilized eight divisions of troops to occupy all the important towns in Western Fujian and attack the small number of people's armed forces. The people of Western Fujian then entered a very difficult three-year guerrilla war.
　　In those years, the struggle was very difficult. The Kuomintang reactionary army used the policy of burning, killing, looting, arresting, and moving to destroy Western Fujian. As a result, as Chiang Kai-shek confessed in his report that year: "No house is not burned, no tree is not felled, no chicken or dog is not killed, no able-bodied man can be left behind, no smoke is seen in the village, and only ghosts are heard crying in the fields." The local tyrants and landlords returned with the reactionary army, organized reactionary "local corps," took back the land, settled scores, and massacred revolutionary people.
　　However, the people of Western Fujian stubbornly persisted in the struggle. In Longyan, Yongding, and other places, peasants organized guerrilla groups to cooperate with the Red Army guerrillas to launch heroic struggles. Every time they arrived at a place, they posted slogans and notices such as "Strictly prohibit landlords from taking back land and collecting rent" and "Those who take back land will be killed." The year 1935 was the most acute year of the struggle. In Baituo, Longyan, the peasant guerrilla group, in cooperation with the Red Army guerrillas, sneaked to the enemy's bunker on a moonless night and killed more than ten stubborn landlords and despots, including Chen Guitang. General landlords were also educated. In this way, the peasants of Nanxi, Yongding, took back the land taken by the landlord class. In most areas of Longyan, part of Shanghang, including areas with a population of 150,000, the peasants, relying on the leadership and support of the Communist Party and the Red Army guerrillas, defeated the joint offensive of the Kuomintang reactionary army, local corps, and the landlord class in a long-term armed struggle, and defended the fruits of the land revolution. The peasants clearly knew: "With the Red Army, there is hope; with the Communist Party, there is hope." They did everything they could to support their army. Therefore, in the three-year guerrilla war, the Red Army guerrillas were not weakened, but developed from 2,000 to 5,000 people.
　　Here, we should highlight the struggle in Houtian Village, the revolutionary stronghold of Western Fujian. Houtian Village is located on the edge of a large mountain pit south of Longyan City. In 1928, the peasants of Houtian Village, under the leadership of the Party, launched an armed uprising. This was one of the first villages to launch an uprising in Western Fujian. During the three-year guerrilla war, Houtian Village suffered countless destruction and looting by the Kuomintang reactionaries. But the people of Houtian Village stubbornly and bravely persisted in the struggle. In 1934, Chen Ke Ma, a military family member in her fifties from Houtian Village, used secret signals to report the enemy's situation to the Longyan County Party Committee. She was discovered by the enemy and captured in Baituo. The enemy asked her: "Where are the Communist Party members?" "Who is related to the Communist Party?" She said: "I don't know." The enemy burned her chest with handfuls of incense sticks and cut off one of her breasts. But she said nothing. The enemy had no choice but to execute her and four other victims on the evening of September 28. The enemy's bullet hit her in the mouth, and she fainted, but did not die. In the middle of the night, Chen Ke Ma woke up and secretly crawled to Quanjing Village, two miles away from Baituo, and hid in her daughter's house. Later, she returned to Houtian Village and hid. The Red Army guerrillas heard that she had escaped and often brought medicine to treat her. Later, Chen Ke Ma's injuries healed, and she worked more actively for the Party and the Red Army. At that time, the enemy adopted the "bunker policy" (seven were built in Houtian Village alone) to block the mountain passes, attempting to starve the guerrillas on the mountain to death. What the guerrillas on the mountain needed most was food. Chen Ke Ma and many other brave people unhesitatingly took on the task of delivering food to the guerrillas. At the same time, she also helped the guerrillas deliver intelligence and find clues. After a few months, the enemy discovered that she was not dead and investigated her whereabouts. On the evening of December 7, she was arrested again. The enemy said: "Well, you are not bad, you can't be killed by bullets." Chen Ke Ma said fearlessly: "It doesn't matter, you can execute me again!" The enemy said: "Death is not so cheap." The enemy took her to a blockhouse five miles away from Houtian Village and burned her alive... Before Chen Ke Ma died, she shouted: "It is glorious to die for the revolution!" "The Red Army will avenge me!" "Long live the Red Army!"... The heroic Chen Ke Ma died generously in the flames.
　　When the War of Resistance Against Japan began, the Western Fujian Communist Party made its best efforts to mobilize the people of Western Fujian to carry out various anti-Japanese work and support the front line. However, in 1939, the Kuomintang reactionaries again supported the "owners' groups" organized by local tyrants and landlords to take back land and collect rent from the peasants. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the peasants shattered this conspiracy of the landlord class. Chen Goulan, a landlord in Baituo Town, had more than 1,000 buckets of rice fields (about 400 mu). He participated in the "owners' group" and prepared to collect rent from the peasants. One night, more than 100 peasants ran to Chen Goulan's vegetable garden and pulled out all the vegetables. Everyone also took a stone and threw it at Chen Goulan's house. The next day, Chen Goulan was frightened and ran away. Because the peasants showed great strength, the landlords dared not collect rent from the peasants.
　　Later, the Kuomintang reactionaries used other methods to help the landlords take back the land in order to consolidate the landlord's rule. But they all failed.
　　On January 9, 1941, the Kuomintang reactionaries revealed their man-eating faces and launched the "Western Fujian Incident," carrying out a large-scale massacre of the people of Western Fujian. The Kuomintang reactionary army surrounded the resident of the Western Fujian Special Committee - Houtian Village, and the resident of the Longyan County Committee - Xichen Tiaowei Village, with two regiments of troops respectively. The Special Committee evacuated in advance, and the Minister of Propaganda of the County Committee was arrested. Then, the Kuomintang carried out large-scale arrests in Longyan, Shanghang, Yongding and other places. Nearly a thousand Communist Party members, revolutionary family members and masses were arrested and killed during this period. The enemy also used the vicious "self-renewal policy" to force the masses to go through the "self-renewal" procedures in order to attack the prestige of the Communist Party. They also threatened the revolutionary family members to go to the mountains to call their husbands or sons back to "self-renew."
　　However, all intimidation and deception could not shake the Communist Party members' determination to fight. The guerrilla war in the mountains persisted extremely hard. In order to avoid the enemy's encirclement and attacks, the guerrillas built shacks with mulberry bark and bamboo in many mountainsides and mountain pits such as Jiulong Cave in Longyan to shelter from the wind and rain. In winter, the climate in the mountains was very cold, and the comrades had no cotton clothes or quilts, so they had to light a fire to keep warm. Due to the Kuomintang reactionaries' strict blockade, eating became a big problem. At this time, the working people of Western Fujian did everything they could to support their armed forces. Peasants in Dongpi, Xichen, Dachi, Xiaochi and other villages in Longyan risked their lives to sneak through the enemy's bunkers and blockades to deliver grain to the mountains. In the autumn of 1942, the comrades who persisted in the struggle on the mountain scattered to reclaim wasteland and produce. They irrigated the grain they needed with their own blood and sweat.
　　From 1944 to 1945, the revolutionary situation in Western Fujian began to improve. In September 1944, the Western Fujian People's Armed Forces - Wang Tao Detachment (Comrade Wang Tao served as the Secretary of the Western Fujian Party Committee of the Communist Party of China in the early days of the Anti-Japanese War and sacrificed in August 1941) was officially established. In 1949, this team developed into the Min-Guangdong-Ganzhou Border Column. In August of the same year, this team cooperated with the southward army to liberate the cities of Dabu, Meixian, Jiaoling, Xingning, Pingyuan in Guangdong, and Longyan, Yongding, Shanghang in Western Fujian, and finally liberated Shantou, and victoriously met with the southward People's Liberation Army.

　　闽西人民的胜利
    王树人
    闽西革命根据地位于福建西南部的山地，包括龙岩、永定、上杭、长廷武平、连城、漳平等县约一百余万人口的地区。这个地区曾有很长时期，和江西中央革命根据地联在一起，成为当时中央革命根据地组成部分之一。著名的“古田会议”就是在上杭古田召开的。红军主力北上抗日后，闽西人民在地方党领导之下，坚持了十七年的斗争，以后配合南下大军，解放了汕头、梅县、龙岩、上杭等十多个城市。直至福建全境解放。
    早在一九二七年，在共产党领导下，闽西部分地区就建立了秘密的农民协会。一九二八年，闽西农民在党的领导下，首先在永定的金砂、龙岩的白土、上杭的蛟洋三个地方举行起义。数百农民用鸟枪、马刀、三股叉、九节龙做武器，攻打龙岩和永定县城。这些起义震撼了整个闽西，提高了农民的觉悟。一九二九年四月，工农红军第四军在毛主席、朱总司令率领下，由江西进入闽西。闽西农民用起义来迎接自己的领袖。起义的规模是很大的。据当时参加起义的农民谈：像“烧山”一样，从长汀而龙岩，而永定、上杭……革命的烽火烧遍了闽西的山野与峡谷。村村的墙壁上写满了“打土豪，分田地”的标语，地主恶霸的田地和财产依法没收，分配给贫苦农民。在龙岩、永定、武平等县，就有八十万以上的农民分得了土地。革命委员会和工农政府随即成立了。至今农民谈起当年起义情形时，个个是眉飞色舞，神采焕发。龙岩雷隔村六十岁的邱茂荣说：“那时我们都喜欢得睡不着觉……，那时我们每个人都有块红布，有挂在胸上的，有扣在钮扣上的……，那时妇女大都剪了发，放了脚，参加开会，放哨，出操，几千年的封建制度打破了……那时我们的日子过得很好，那时我们第一次知道，我们有了自己的队伍和党，就是红军和共产党……”
    一九三四年红军北上抗日后，国民党匪帮就先后调动了八个师的兵力，侵占了闽西所有的重要城镇，向人数不多的人民武装进攻。闽西人民于是进入极艰苦的三年游击战争生活中。
    在这些年月里，斗争是非常艰苦的。国民党反动军队用烧、杀、抢、抓、移等五光政策来毁灭闽西。结果正如蒋匪介石在当年的报告书中所自供的：“无不焚之屋，无不伐之树，无不杀之鸡犬，无可遗留之壮丁，闾阎不见炊烟，田间但闻鬼哭”。豪绅地主随着反动军队回来，组织反动“民团”，夺田倒算，屠杀革命人民。
    但是，闽西人民顽强地坚持了斗争。在龙岩、永定等地，农民组织了游击小组，配合红军游击队展开英勇的斗争。每到一地，就贴起“严禁地主夺田收租”、“夺田者杀”的标语和布告。一九三五年是斗争最尖锐的一年。在龙岩的白土，农民游击组配合红军游击队，在一个无月的夜晚，摸到敌人的碉堡旁边，杀死顽固地主恶霸陈桂堂等十余人。又集中教育了一般地主。这样，永定南溪的农民，又把地主阶级夺去的土地夺回来了。在龙岩大部分地区、上杭一部分地区包括十五万人口的地方，农民依靠共产党与红军游击队的领导与支持，在长期武装斗争中，打败了国民党反动军队、民团和地主阶级的联合进攻，保卫了土地革命的果实。农民们清楚地知道：“有红军，就有希望；有共产党，就有希望。”他们用尽一切办法来支持自己的军队。因此，在三年游击战争中，红军游击队不但没有被削弱，反而从二千人发展到五千人。
    这里，应该突出地介绍一下闽西革命的胜地——后田村的斗争。后田村在龙岩城南一个大山坑的边缘上。一九二八年，后田村的农民在党的领导下，举行了武装起义。这是闽西最先起义的村庄之一。在三年游击战争中，后田村曾遭受国民党反动派无数次摧残与洗劫。但后田村的人民顽强、勇敢地坚持着斗争。一九三四年，后田村五十多岁的军属陈客嫲，用暗号向龙岩县委报告了敌情，被敌人发觉了，她被抓到白土。敌人问她：“共产党员都在那里？”“那些人和共产党有关系？”她说：“我不知道。”敌人用成把的香火烧她的胸部，又割去她一个奶子。但是她什么都没有说。敌人没有什么办法，就在九月二十八日傍晚，把她和其他四个受难者枪决了。敌人的子弹从她嘴上打过去，她晕倒了，但没有死。半夜里，陈客嫲醒过来，偷偷地爬到离白土二里路的泉井村，藏到她女儿家里，以后又回到后田村藏起来。红军游击队听说她脱险回来了，经常带药给她医治。以后，陈客嫲的伤好了，更积极地为党为红军工作。那时，敌人采用“碉堡政策”（仅在后田村就造了七个）封锁山口，企图困死山上的游击队。山上的游击队最需要的是粮食。陈客嫲和其他许多英勇的人民一样，毫不犹豫地担任起给游击队送粮送饭的任务。同时，她还帮助游击队送情报、找线索。过了几个月，敌人发觉她还没有死，又侦察她的行踪。在十二月七日晚上，她又被捕了。敌人说：“嗯，你倒不错，枪都打不死。”陈客嫲毫无畏惧地说：“没关系，你再枪毙我好了！”敌人却说：“死，没有这样便宜。”敌人又把她带到白土，用各种酷刑拷问她，要她供出“接头”的关系。但是陈客嫲忍受了一切痛苦，只回答：“不知道。”最后，敌人把她押到离后田村五里的一个炮楼里，活活烧死……陈客嫲在死前高喊：“为革命而死是光荣的！”“红军会给我报仇！”“红军万岁！”……英雄的陈客嫲在烈火中慷慨就义了。
    抗日战争开始，闽西共产党以最大的努力，动员闽西人民，进行各种抗日工作，支援前线。但是，国民党反动派在一九三九年又支持恶霸地主组织的“业主团”，向农民夺田收租。农民在共产党领导之下粉碎了地主阶级这种阴谋。白土镇地主陈狗卵有一千多桶谷田（约合四百亩）他参加了“业主团”，准备向农民收租，一天晚上，一百多农民跑到陈狗卵的菜园里，把菜都拔掉了。每个人还拿了一块石头，一齐向陈狗卵房子打去，第二天，陈狗卵就被吓跑了。由于农民表现了巨大的力量，地主就再也不敢向农民收租了。
      以后国民党反动派又用其他办法，帮助地主夺田，以巩固地主的统治地位。但都失败了。
    一九四一年一月九日，国民党反动派暴露了吃人生番的面目，发动了“闽西事变”，对闽西人民进行大规模的屠杀。国民党反动军队以两个团的兵力，分别包围了闽西特委驻地——后田村，和龙岩县委驻地——西陈条围村。特委事先撤出，县委宣传部长被捕。接着，国民党就在龙岩、上杭、永定等地大肆逮捕。这一时期被捕杀的共产党员、革命家属和群众近千人。敌人又运用了毒辣的“自新政策”，逼迫群众履行“自新”手续，以打击共产党的威信。还威胁革命家属，到山地去叫自己的丈夫或儿子回去“自新”。
    但是，一切恫吓和欺骗都不能动摇共产党人的斗争决心。山上的游击战争极端艰苦地坚持着。为了避免敌人的包围、袭击，游击队在龙岩九龙洞等许多山腰里、山坑里，用桑树皮和竹子搭起寮房，以蔽风雨。冬天，山间的气候很冷，同志们没有棉衣和棉被，只好升起火来取暖。由于国民党反动派的严密封锁，吃饭发生了大问题。这时，闽西劳动人民用尽一切办法，支持自己的武装队伍。龙岩东皮、西陈、大池、小池等村农民，冒着生命的危险，摸过敌人的碉堡和封锁线，将粮食送到山上。一九四二年秋天，在山上坚持斗争的同志分散开荒生产。用自己的血汗，灌溉自己需要的粮食。
    一九四四年到一九四五年，闽西革命形势开始好转。一九四四年九月，闽西人民武装——王涛支队（王涛同志在抗战初期任中共闽西党委书记，在一九四一年八月牺牲）正式成立。一九四九年，这支队伍发展成为闽粤赣边区纵队。同年八月，这支队伍配合南下大军，解放了广东的大埔、梅县、蕉岭、兴宁、平远，闽西的龙岩、永定、上杭等城市，最后解放了汕头，与南下的人民解放军胜利会师。
