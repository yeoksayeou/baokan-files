    Preferential Treatment Work in Shaanxi Province and Guangzhou City

    In response to the call of the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association to do a good job in preferential treatment work, organs, troops, schools, and peasant masses in various parts of Shaanxi Province have actively helped the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel in the summer harvest. Before the summer harvest, most units carried out ideological mobilization, set out the conditions for helping with the summer harvest, and determined the specific objects of assistance. Many peasants and members of mutual aid groups conscientiously implemented the patriotic covenant. They not only helped the families of martyrs, military personnel, and workers with the harvest, but also threshed, cleaned, and dried the grain in advance. Peasants in many areas have also established plans to help the families of martyrs and military personnel with production in the future. Through the movement of helping the families of martyrs and military personnel with the summer harvest, the masses' understanding of Resist America, Aid Korea has been further enhanced. At the same time, the political consciousness of the families of martyrs and military personnel has also been raised. Many military families have written letters to their relatives in the army, encouraging them to work hard to defend their homes and the country.

    The Guangzhou Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau recently formulated a work plan for preferential treatment of the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel. The plan mainly includes: continuing to assist various districts in organizing committees and production organizations for the families of martyrs, military personnel, and workers, so that the poor families of martyrs, military personnel, and workers can collectively organize production for self-reliance. Continuing to provide small production loans to poor families of martyrs, military personnel, and workers who have the ability to work. In the suburbs, it is planned to organize tilling groups to till or help till for the families of martyrs, military personnel, and workers who have no ability to work. For the widowed, orphaned, lonely, helpless, and destitute families of martyrs, military personnel, and workers who have no ability to work, subsidies will be provided, or they will be placed in the bureau's elderly care home on a voluntary basis.

            陕西省及广州市的优抚工作
    陕西省各地机关、部队、学校和农民群众，响应抗美援朝总会关于做好优抚工作的号召，在夏收中，积极帮助烈属、军属进行夏收工作。各单位在夏收前大都进行了思想动员，订出了帮助夏收的条件，确定了帮助的具体对象。许多农民们、互助组组员们都认真执行爱国公约，他们不但帮助烈、军、工属收割，而且还提前给碾净、干晒。许多地区的农民并订立了今后帮助烈、军属生产的计划。通过帮助烈、军属夏收的运动，更提高了群众对抗美援朝的认识。同时，也提高了烈、军属的政治觉悟。许多军属写信给他们参加部队的亲人，鼓励他们努力保家卫国。
    广州市人民政府民政局最近订立了优抚烈军属的工作计划。计划主要是：继续协助各区组织烈、军、工属委员会和生产机构，使贫苦烈、军、工属都能集体组织生产自救。继续对有劳动能力的贫苦烈、军、工属进行小型生产贷款。在郊区，计划组织代耕小组，对无劳动力的烈、军、工属进行代耕或帮耕。对鳏寡孤独、无人倚靠、生活无着而又无劳动力的烈、军、工属，发给补助粮，或在自愿原则下把他们安置到该局的老人教养院。
