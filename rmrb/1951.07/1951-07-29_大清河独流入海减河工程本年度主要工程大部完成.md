　　Daqing River Independent Entry into the Sea and Flood Diversion Project
　　Main Projects Largely Completed This Year
    The main projects within the annual plan for the Daqing River's independent entry into the sea and flood diversion project have been largely completed. The foundation works, such as earthwork, foundation piles, and sheet piles, for the locks and control gates of the upstream diversion project of the South Grand Canal, and the sluice gate of the downstream diversion project of the South Grand Canal, were completed in mid to late May respectively. For the upstream locks and control gates of the South Grand Canal, the stone slopes, concrete, masonry, and wire cages have been completed by an average of about 80%, except for the concrete work, which is half completed. The work on the intake gate in the downstream section of the South Grand Canal has now completed about 65% of the total project. It is expected that these three sluice gates will be fully completed by December of this year at the latest.
    In addition, the foundation soil exploration work for the control mechanism at the mouth of the flood diversion channel has also been completed, and the foundation work will commence in the second half of this year.
