Sinister Deeds Under the Mask
　　——An Exhibition of Imperialist Crimes of Aggression Against China Under the Guise of Religion
　　Xu Kecheng
The religious masks worn by imperialist elements have been repeatedly torn off by the Chinese people. Hypocritically dressed in cassocks, they engage in despicable, shameless, insidious and vicious criminal activities. In the "Exhibition of Imperialist Crimes of Aggression Against China Under the Guise of Religion" held by the Tianjin-Guji University Summer Life Committee, we can clearly see the ugly and ferocious true faces of the imperialist elements.

Under the cover of religion, imperialist elements carried out espionage activities that endangered the Chinese people. Tianjin-Guji University was originally a stronghold for their counter-revolutionary activities. The former president of the university, a French priest named Shang Jianxun, was the American spy who used the Catholic Church in Xianxian, Hebei, in 1947 as a cover to collect intelligence on the Liberated Areas. All his intelligence was transferred to the U.S. military intelligence agency through Tianjin-Guji University. At the exhibition, there are two photos that were torn up and then pieced together. One shows a foreign priest taking out intelligence placed under the bicycle seat and in the tires. The other shows Xu Baohe, the former Dean of Students of Tianjin-Guji University, a special agent priest, sending and receiving telegrams. These photos, used by these imperialist elements and their lackeys to seek rewards from their American masters, were intended to be destroyed by them after liberation to escape the just judgment of the people. But today, the torn photos have been pieced together and remain powerful evidence for the Chinese people to demand repayment of blood debts from the imperialists.

Not only that, but in the basement of Tianjin-Guji University, American spies Bu Xiangxian, Bao Yihua, and others specially opened a secret room to carry out criminal activities. Now the secret room has been opened by the people for all to visit; a machine gun originally hidden in the secret room for attempted riots and the radio station they used to send and receive intelligence have also become exhibits in the "Exhibition of Crimes."

These imperialist elements have an even more sinister face. Sang Zhihua, the former "Director" of the "Beijiang Museum" within Tianjin-Guji University, and another imperialist element, Ming Xingli, roamed around China under the protection of a French flag, collecting intelligence, and then placed the intelligence in boxes with French flags attached to transport it abroad without hindrance. In Bu Xiangxian's former office, there was also a French flag issued by the "French Concession Engineering Bureau" with the words "Detective Office No. 4" written on it. They openly appeared before the Chinese people with such an imperialist face, engaging in espionage activities. These things are yet another piece of evidence of the crimes of the imperialist elements.

After liberation, these spies continued their activities. In Fang Ruhui's file, there was openly placed a mechanical arrangement diagram of the No. 5 Textile Factory. Obviously, this blueprint is just a part of their espionage crimes.

The past Tianjin-Guji University was also a major tool for imperialist elements to carry out cultural aggression. In addition to openly preaching in classrooms, spreading anti-communist, anti-people remarks, and promoting the decadent culture of U.S. imperialism, they also used slides for reactionary propaganda. Dozens of reels of slides secretly hidden by Bao Yihua and Fang Ruhui contained the ugly images of the top war criminal Chiang Kai-shek, Yan Xishan, and the traitorous puppets Pu Yi and Wang Jingwei, as well as shameless pictures fabricated to promote the "strength" of U.S. imperialism. Moreover, they also used the slides as intelligence, containing the terrain and maps of certain areas.

The imperialist element Bu Xiangxian also personally wrote a reactionary pamphlet, "Atomic Bomb and Cosmic Spirit," to promote the atomic bomb. Similar reactionary propaganda materials were found in large quantities in the library of Tianjin-Guji University and in the residences of imperialist elements such as Bu Xiangxian. The "Beichen" magazine, edited by Deng Huaguang, an imperialist running dog who has been arrested by the People's Government, slandered communism and the socialist construction of the Soviet Union, but it was a "treasure" of this library; "Red Lily," which shamelessly slandered the Yihetuan (Boxer) movement of the Chinese people against imperialist aggression, was also placed in the library in more than one copy. Hundreds of other secret reactionary propaganda materials published by the "Catholic Church Affairs Coordination Committee" in Hong Kong and Shanghai were found in Tianjin-Guji University. Imperialist elements such as Bu Xiangxian widely distributed these reactionary propaganda materials through the reactionary organization "Legion of Mary." Bu Xiangxian once ordered Xiao Zhiqin, the director of the branch of the "Legion of Mary," to list the booklet "China's Return to God" as the main learning material of the "Legion of Mary." In this booklet, absurd remarks from "China's Destiny" were extracted and disseminated.

After liberation, the imperialist elements and their running dogs continued to run rampant, repeatedly obstructing the regular studies of Tianjin-Guji University and the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea within the school. The imperialist element, Priest Tao Tianjing, destroyed more than fifty basketball and volleyball bladders when he was the director of the school's physical education department; Zhao Yuanjun, the director of the branch of the "Legion of Mary" and the former director of the school library, had forged the seals of all the teachers, students, staff, and workers living in the school before liberation to privately collect "rationed flour"; after liberation, he stole books, some of which he secretly burned, while others were searched out from his residence. These broken ball bladders and seals are yet another piece of evidence of the crimes of the imperialist elements and their running dogs.

Among the exhibits, there are also two torn cartoons. Half of the cartoon "Imperialist Elements Get Out of China" was found in Fang Ruhui's briefcase. As for the other one, "Truman's Prayer," Fang Ruhui had already taken a full picture of it, but he also openly tore off the original painting from the wall. The students snatched it back from him and re-pasted it, but he tore it off again. Now the students have exhibited the half of the painting that was snatched back the second time.

These "priests" who engaged in anti-people activities also had very dirty private lives. Fang Ruhui threw the crucifix under the bed, covered with dust, but in the drawer of the table next to his bed, he carefully preserved the most obscene and shameless things. He had three specially made magnifying glasses, with photos behind them. Looking through the lenses, one could see pictures of men and women embracing and pictures of female genitalia. He also had a large number of semi-nude pictures of women cut from American magazines. Not only that, but he also had a bottle of anesthetic that could cause a person to faint on the spot when sprayed, allowing him to do whatever he wanted. And in Tianjin-Guji University, such scandals did happen.

In room number twelve on the second floor of the priest's dormitory, a package of "Salvarsan for treating syphilis" produced by the Xianxian Catholic Church was found in another priest's room. The reading materials of Qi Zhengui, the principal of the affiliated high school of Tianjin-Guji University and a priest, were actually "Modern Venereology" and obscene books such as "The Source of Life." Also, on the bookshelf of the imperialist element Bei Xingren, a large number of meticulously collected clippings were found, the contents of which were: "How Beautiful Ladies Get Healthy Beauty" and "Modern Women's Beauty Methods" and other vulgar works from yellow newspapers. These are the reading materials of the sanctimonious priests, which is the most powerful answer to their professed prohibition of fornication.

The "Legion of Mary" rampantly carried out reactionary activities in Tianjin-Guji University. Among the exhibits, there is a lot of evidence of the "Legion of Mary's" crimes: military flags, manuals, membership cards, and meeting records. Other knives and threatening letters that Man Jishi attempted to use for assassination were also exhibited at the meeting.

This exhibition is only a part of the evidence of imperialist aggression against China using Catholicism. But even just these things can make us recognize the true face of this group of beasts.

　　假面具掩盖下的罪恶勾当
　  ——记帝国主义利用宗教侵略中国罪证展览会
　　许可成
    帝国主义分子戴着的宗教假面具，已一再被中国人民所揭穿，他们伪善地穿着袈裟，却干着卑鄙无耻、阴险恶毒的罪恶勾当。在津沽大学暑期生活委员会举办的“帝国主义利用宗教侵略中国罪证展览会”上，我们可以清楚地看到帝国主义分子丑恶狰狞的真面目。
    帝国主义分子以宗教为掩护，进行了危害中国人民的间谍活动。津沽大学原是他们进行反革命活动的堡垒。该校前身工商学院院长法籍神甫尚建勋，也就是一九四七年在河北献县利用天主堂作掩护，搜集解放区情报的美国间谍。他的情报全部由天津津沽大学转交美军间谍机关。在展览会上，有两张被撕碎后又拼凑起来的照片，一张上，有一个外籍神甫在取出放在自行车座子下及车胎里的情报。另一张上，是特务神甫前津沽大学训育长徐保和正在收发电报。这些帝国主义分子及其走狗用来向他们的美国主子邀功领赏的照片，他们在解放后企图把它销毁，以逃避人民的正义裁判。但是今天，撕碎了的照片，拼了起来，依旧是中国人民向帝国主义讨还血债的有力证据。
    不但如此，在津沽大学的地下室里，美国间谍卜相贤、鲍翊华等还特地开辟了一个密室，来进行罪恶活动。现在密室被人民打开了，任人参观；原来藏在密室里的一挺企图暴动用的机关枪，和他们收发情报的无线电台也成为“罪证展览会”的展品了。
    这些帝国主义分子有一副更狠毒的面目。津沽大学内的前“北疆博物院”“院长”桑志华和另一个帝国主义分子明兴礼，就以一面法国国旗，在中国境内到处横行，搜集情报，又把情报放在贴着法国国旗的箱子里，不受阻挠地运出国外。在卜相贤过去的办公室里也有着一面“法租界工部局”发给的法国国旗，上写“侦探处四号”。他们就以这样的帝国主义面目公开出现在中国人民面前，进行间谍活动。这些东西，也就是帝国主义分子的又一罪证。
    解放后，这些间谍仍在进行活动。在房如晦的档案卷里，公然放着中纺五厂的机械排列图。很明显，这张蓝图不过是他们间谍罪证的一部分。
    过去的津沽大学也是帝国主义分子进行文化侵略的一个主要工具。他们除了在课堂上公开传教，散布反共、反人民言论，宣扬美帝国主义的没落文化外，还利用幻灯来进行反动宣传。鲍翊华、房如晦密藏着的几十卷幻灯片，内容有头号战犯蒋介石、阎锡山和汉奸傀儡溥仪、汪精卫等的丑态，也有虚构的宣传美帝国主义“强大”的无耻画。而且，他们还把幻灯片作为情报，里面有某些地区的地形和地图。
    帝国主义分子卜相贤，还亲自写了反动小册子《原子弹与宇宙精神》，来宣传原子弹。类似的反动宣传品在津沽大学的图书馆里和帝国主义分子卜相贤等的住室里，被大量发现。已被人民政府逮捕的帝国主义走狗邓华光主编的《北辰》杂志，诋毁共产主义、诋毁苏联社会主义建设，却是这个图书馆的“宝藏”；无耻诬蔑中国人民反对帝国主义侵略的义和团的《红百合花》，也不止一部放在图书馆里。其他香港及上海“天主教教务协进委员会”出版的秘密反动宣传品，在津沽大学内有数百种。帝国主义分子卜相贤等通过反动组织“圣母军”，广为散发这些反动宣传品，卜相贤就曾命令“圣母军”支会指导司铎萧志清，将小册子《中国归主》列为“圣母军”的主要学习材料。在这本册子里，《中国之命运》中的荒谬言论被摘录下来传布。
    在解放后，帝国主义分子及其走狗，仍横行霸道，一再阻挠津沽大学的正规学习和校内的抗美援朝运动。帝国主义分子神甫陶天经，在任学校体育部主任时，毁坏了五十多个篮排球胎；“圣母军”支会的指导司铎，前学校图书馆主任赵元俊，在解放前曾假造全校住宿师生工友的图章，私领“配给面”；解放后，又偷盗图书，有的图书已被他秘密烧毁，有的却从他住室里被搜查了出来。这些破球胎和图章，又是帝国主义分子及其走狗的另一罪证。
    展品中，还有两幅被撕破了的漫画。半张漫画“帝国主义分子滚出中国去”是从房如晦的皮包中找出来的。另一幅“杜鲁门的祈祷”，房如晦已经把它全幅照了相，但他还公开从壁上撕去了原画，同学们从他手里抢回来重贴上，又被他撕去，现在同学们把第二次抢回来的半幅画展览出来了。
    这些进行反人民活动的“神甫”，他们的私生活也十分污秽。房如晦把十字架甩在床底下，上面积满了尘土，可是在他床边的桌子抽屉里，却细心保存着最下流无耻的东西。他有三架特造的放大镜，镜后放着照片，从镜头上往里看竟是男女搂抱的图画和女性生殖器的图画。他还有大批从美国画报上剪下来的半裸体的女人像。不仅如此，他还有一瓶迷药，药喷出来能够使人当场昏迷，任其所欲。而在津沽大学内，也确实发生过这样的丑行。
    在神甫宿舍二楼十二号，另一个神甫的房里，发现了献县天主堂出品的“杀杨梅毒”药包。津沽附中校长、神甫齐振国的读物竟是《现代性病学》和诲淫书籍《生命的源泉》等。又在帝国主义分子贝兴仁的书架上，找出了大批细密收藏的剪报，内容是：“美丽的小姐是怎样得来的健康美”和“现代妇女美容法”之类的黄色报纸上的下流作品。这些就是道貌岸然的神甫们的读物，这也就是对他们口称不准邪淫的最有力的回答。
    “圣母军”在津沽大学曾猖獗进行反动活动，展品中就有不少的“圣母军”的罪证：军旗、手册、会员证及会议记录。其他满济世企图用来暗杀的刀子和恐吓信，也在会上展览出来了。
    这个展览会，还只是帝国主义利用天主教侵略中国罪证的一部分。但仅此一些，也能使我们认识这群野兽的真面目了。
