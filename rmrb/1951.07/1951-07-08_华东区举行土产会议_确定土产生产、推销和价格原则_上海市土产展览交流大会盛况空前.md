　　East China Region Holds Native Products Conference
　　Defining Principles for Production, Promotion, and Pricing of Native Products
　　Shanghai Native Products Exhibition and Exchange Conference a Great Success
　　The East China Region Native Products Conference was held in Shanghai from June 15th to 30th. This conference was conducted under the leadership of Rao Shushi, Chairman of the East China Military and Political Committee, and Vice Chairman Zeng Shan. Over 700 representatives from relevant parties inside and outside the region attended and participated in the meeting. The output value of native products, specialty products, and handicrafts in the East China Region accounts for 34% of the total grain output value of the region. After vigorous promotion since February this year, the region's native products are generally in the process of developing from sluggish sales to good sales, and from good sales to hot sales. The conference specifically defined the guiding principles for the production, sales, and prices of various native products: (1) For popular native products that are generally in short supply, the sales prices must be adjusted with reference to the prices in the producing areas, under the premise of reducing trafficking profits, in order to accelerate the development of production and strengthen market management. (2) For marketable native products that can be produced and sold in greater quantities, both producers and sellers should adopt the principle of small profits and quick turnover. (3) For relatively slow-selling native products, it is necessary to open up sales channels or develop broader markets, adjust the relationship between production and sales, and continue to improve quality and specifications. In general, the prices in the producing areas should be temporarily subordinate to the prices in the selling areas. (4) For individual native products that are sluggish due to stagnation in foreign sales, consideration may be given to suspending or reducing production as appropriate. (5) Native products related to the supply of industrial raw materials should be vigorously developed. According to the reports from representatives of various regions, the current production level of native products in the region has not generally reached the due level of recovery; about 15% of the total output of native products in the region in 1950 has not yet been sold. In order to open up the sales of slow-selling native products and restore and develop production, the conference decided that it is necessary to overcome the many obstacles that still exist in the current exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and the exchange of native products, such as malpractices in transportation and sales, feudal monopoly, unreasonable commissions, handling labor costs, and the poor quality and specifications of native products. The People's Government should attach importance to this reform and provide specific leadership. At the closing of the East China Native Products Conference, all the representatives passed ten covenants for implementing the conference's summary and resolutions, and unanimously pledged to implement the covenants in all regions and industries.
　　The East China Region Native Products Conference cooperated with the Shanghai Native Products Exhibition and Exchange Conference, holding meetings and conducting transactions simultaneously. By June 29th, the total value of native products transaction contracts, agreements, and spot transactions reached more than 400 billion yuan.

　　Since its opening on June 10th, the Shanghai Native Products Exhibition and Exchange Conference has attracted extremely enthusiastic visitors. On the first day after the conference closed, the number of visitors reached 114,000. Subsequently, due to unfavorable weather, the number of visitors decreased slightly, but averaged over 50,000 per day. June 17th was the eighth day of the exhibition, and it was a Sunday with good weather, with 135,000 visitors. As of June 20th, the total number of visitors exceeded 700,000. The entire venue was crowded from morning to night. The scale was unprecedented in any exhibition in Shanghai.
　　Due to the strong policy orientation in the layout of each pavilion, the exhibition effect was generally very good. Mr. Zhu Qiming said, "The treasures of the motherland are deep and huge. With diligent development, the country will be rich and the people will be strong." The 11th group of the Zhabei District Industry and Commerce Training Class collectively visited the conference and wrote, "The native products exhibition and exchange conference held by the government this time has enhanced our understanding and love for the motherland. The glory of the new China is radiant." An office cadre wrote after visiting the Handicraft Products Pavilion, "It is equivalent to learning a lesson on how labor creates the world in the history of social development." Lu Fusheng wrote, "After visiting, I realized that our country has rich products, surpassing imported goods. If everyone promotes their application in the future, we will definitely be able to break the imperialist blockade." After visiting, the general audience had a deeper understanding of the greatness of the motherland and aroused a deeper love for the motherland.
　　In terms of business exchanges, there were two sessions, morning and evening, before June 14th. From the 15th, in coordination with the East China Native Products Conference, only one afternoon session was held. At present, the four exchanges have held a total of 36 sessions. There were 71 spot transactions, 35 contracts, and 106 agreements, totaling 212 transactions. Agreements accounted for 50% of the total. Because agreements mostly involve large transactions, the amount of agreements accounted for 94.26% of the total transaction amount. Contracts accounted for 3.09%, and spot transactions only accounted for 2.65%. In terms of sales, Subei took the lead, accounting for 26.72% of the total sales amount. The North China region is rich in native products, and the promotion is planned, and the number of sales transactions is also large, accounting for 24.55% of the total sales amount, ranking second. Central South, Southwest, Northwest, Shandong and other regions also have a large proportion. It is reported that the business preparations of the delegations from various regions are now more sufficient, and the number of transactions will continue to increase in the future.

　　华东区举行土产会议
    确定土产生产、推销和价格原则         
    上海市土产展览交流大会盛况空前
    华东区土产会议自六月十五日到三十日在上海举行。这次会议在华东军政委员会主席饶漱石和副主席曾山领导下进行。出席、列席会议的区内外有关方面代表共七百多人。华东区土产、特产、手工业品的产量折值全区粮产总值百分之三十四。经过今年二月以来的大力推销，全区土产目前一般地正处在从滞销到行销、行销到畅销的发展过程中。这次会议具体地确定了各种土产的产、销和价格指导原则：（一）一般已感供不应求的畅销土产，须在降低贩运利润的前提下，参照产地价格调整销地价格，以加速发展生产，并加强市场管理。（二）对于行销和可能多产多销的土产，产销双方都应采取薄利多销的方针。（三）比较滞销的土产，需要打开销路或开辟更广阔的市场，还须调整产、销关系，继续改进品质规格。一般地并应暂时使产地价格服从销地。（四）个别因外销停滞而滞销的土产，可酌情考虑停产或减产。（五）有关工业原料供应的土产，要大力发展。根据各地代表的汇报推算，目前全区土产生产水平一般地还没有达到应有的恢复程度；全区一九五零年土产总产量百分之十五左右还未销出。为了打开滞销土产的销路，恢复与发展生产，会议决定必须克服目前城乡物资交流、土产交流中还存在着的许多障碍，如运销中的陋规，封建性把持，不合理的佣费、搬运力资，以及土产品质、规格的低劣。人民政府应该重视这一改革，并且加以具体领导。华东土产会议闭幕时，全体代表通过十条执行会议总结和决议的公约，并且一致保证把公约贯彻到各地各行业中去。
    华东区土产会议配合上海市土产展览交流大会，一面开会一面交易，到六月二十九日止，订定的土产交易合同、协议和现货买卖总值已达四千多亿元。

    上海市土产展览交流大会自六月十日开幕以来，连日前往参观者极为踊跃。大会闭幕第一日，观众即达十一万四千人。其后因气候不好，观众略减，但平均每日仍达五万人以上。十七日为大会展出的第八天，适逢星期，天气又好，参观人数达十三万五千人。截至六月二十日止，全部观众人数已超过七十万人。自朝至晚，整个会场都很拥挤。盛况为上海任何展览会所未有。
    由于各馆布置的政策性较强，展出的效果一般很好。一位朱启明先生说：“祖国宝藏，既深且巨，努力发展，国富民强。”闸北区工商讲习班第十一组集体参观了大会后，写道：“政府这次举办的土产展览交流大会，使我们增强了对祖国的认识和热爱。新中国的光辉光芒万丈。”一个机关干部看了手工业品馆后，写道：“等于学了社会发展史中劳动创造世界的一课。”鲁夫生写道：“参观后才知我国出产丰富，胜过舶来品。以后大家提倡应用，一定能打破帝国主义的封锁。”一般观众参观之后，对祖国的伟大都有了更深一层的认识，激发起对祖国更深的热爱。
    在业务交流方面，六月十四日以前开早晚两场。十五日起为配合华东土产会议，改开下午一场。现四个交易所合计已开三十六场。成交有现交七十一笔，合同三十五笔，协议一百零六笔，合计二百一十二笔。属于协议性质者，恰占百分之五十。因协议多属大笔买卖，故协议的金额占总成交额达百分之九四·二六。合同占百分之三·○九，现交只占百分之二·六五。就售出而论，苏北占先，占售出总金额百分之二六·七二。华北区土产丰富，推销有计划，出售成交的数量也不少，占总销售额的百分之二四·五五。居第二位。中南、西南、西北、山东等地区，比重亦大。据悉，各地代表团业务准备目下更臻充分，交易数额今后将不断增加。
