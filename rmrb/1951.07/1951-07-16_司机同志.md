　　Driver Comrade
    Pan Jijiong
    Everyone who has lived on the Korean battlefield will never forget the driver comrades.
    A strong, vivid image often emerges before our eyes: among high mountains and steep ridges, on open plains, by babbling mountain streams, how many brave and fearless driver comrades, braving enemy aircraft bombing and strafing, drove their cars at lightning speed! When performing tasks, their eyes never knew fatigue. They overcame all the obstacles to driving that the desperate enemy had arranged.
    Many driver comrades, since going to Korea at the end of last October, have not had a full day of rest for half a year. They work every day, carrying out the tasks entrusted to them by the Chinese people, the Korean people, and all the honest people of the world. They transport abundant supplies up, and bring back glorious wounded and sick soldiers. The enemy may damage their health or even their lives, but in no way can it diminish their iron will.
    A twenty-five-year-old young driver, Wang Dong, is an outstanding member of the Youth League. In six months and ten days, he has safely driven more than 14,400 kilometers. Last winter, while working in a certain area, because the road was narrow, the car tilted; despite the enemy's frantic bombing with twelve heavy bombers at the time, he and his assistant, Li Zemin, still risked their lives to rescue the vehicle. On another occasion, in the severe cold season, he took off his trousers and jumped into the river to unload the supplies from two stalled cars. When encountering overturned cars during driving, he always tried his best to pull them up. When transferring the wounded, the two of them further demonstrated a high degree of proletarian friendship, personally carrying the wounded in and out of the car, finding them houses and cooking for them. They received collective letters of praise and thanks from the wounded. Comrade Wang Dong has been awarded a special merit. This time when we returned to China, he also asked me to bring a letter to his beloved wife, Comrade Mu Chunyan. His letter said: "I know that you are working there, and I am very excited. I hope that you will strive to establish merit in production and participate in organizations. I am very healthy and safe, don't worry about me."
    Driver squad leader and Communist Party member Cai Zhongyuan and assistant Cui Rentai were transporting gasoline to a certain place on one occasion. When nearing their destination, the car was spotted by enemy aircraft because the moonlight was very bright. The enemy aircraft's first burst of machine gun fire hit a barrel of gasoline on the car. They immediately stopped the car and bravely climbed onto the car to put out the fire. Unexpectedly, the enemy aircraft circled back and fired another burst of machine gun fire, hitting another barrel of gasoline that had been moved down, and the flames burned more than a丈high. He disregarded everything and used luggage, coats, and snow to put out the fire, finally rescuing most of the supplies, and only later discovered that his hand had been burned. He said: "Completing the tasks assigned by the higher authorities in the most dangerous situations is precisely the excellent quality that a Communist Party member should possess."
    Twenty-two-year-old driver Comrade Shen Rongguo was awarded a major merit for overfulfilling his task. He was scheduled to make two trips in twenty days, but he made four and a half trips in fifteen days, often driving for eleven hours every day. He recently received a letter from home, knowing that his family was receiving preferential treatment and care from the government, which further encouraged his enthusiasm for work. Recently, he suffered from dysentery, but he still insisted on working.
    Driver squad leader Cheng Dexian, along with Dong Xiuyun, Li Chengxiang, and Xia Shanjiu, after safely delivering supplies to the front line, discovered five seriously wounded soldiers in a gully. Cheng Dexian immediately led three comrades to carefully carry the wounded onto the car, cover them with quilts, and cautiously pull them back. On the road, when the wounded had no food to eat, they gave their own dry rations and vegetables to the wounded. After driving for six nights, when they arrived at the lodging place, they gave the wounded the warm room with a heated kang to live in, and the four of them took turns taking care of their bowel movements. The wounded soldiers' clothes were soaked by the rain, and they used fire to dry them. In this way, they kept sending the wounded to the hospital.
    The volunteer aid-Korea driver comrades live the most arduous life of automobile driving workers in the world, but they also enjoy the highest honor. People will never forget the driver comrades' immortal feats in the just war.

　　司机同志
    潘际垧
    每一个在朝鲜战地生活过的人，是永远不会忘记汽车司机同志的。
    一种强烈、生动的形象常常会在我们眼前浮现：在高山峻岭间，在开阔的平原上，在流水潺潺的山溪边，有多少英勇无畏的司机同志，冒着敌机的轰炸扫射，驾着汽车在风驰电掣地飞驶！在执行任务时，他们的眼睛是永远不知道疲倦的。他们克服了绝望的敌人所安排下来的一切行车障碍。
    有许多司机同志，从去年十月底赴朝以来，半年没有获得一整天的休息。他们每天工作着，执行着中国人民、朝鲜人民和全世界正直的人民托付给他们的任务。他们把丰富的物资运上去，把光荣的伤病员转回来。敌人纵或可以损害他们的健康以至生命，然而无论如何，一点也不能减损他们的铁的意志。
    一个二十五岁的青年司机王栋，他是一个优秀的青年团员，在六个月零十天的期间，已经安全行车一万四千四百多公里。去年冬天在某地工作时，因为路狭，车子倾侧了；尽管敌人当时以十二架重轰炸机进行疯狂的轰炸，他和他的助手李泽民依然冒险抢救出了车辆。另一次在严寒的季节，他曾脱掉裤子跳到河里，把抛锚的两辆汽车上的物资卸下。行车中遇到翻倒的车，他总是想尽办法给拉起来。在转运伤员时，他两个更发挥了高度的阶级友爱的精神，亲自背伤员上下车，替他们找房子、做饭，他们受到伤员们集体来信赞扬和感谢。王栋同志已经立了特等功。这次我们回国，他还托我带一封信给他的爱人穆春燕同志，他的信上说：“我知道你在那里工作，很是兴奋。希望你在工作中争取生产立功和参加组织。我很健康和平安，不要挂记我。”
    司机班长、共产党员蔡仲元和助手崔仁太，某次装运汽油去某地。将近目的地时，因为月光很亮，汽车被敌机发现。敌机第一梭机枪子弹打着了车上的一桶汽油，他们立刻停车，勇敢地爬上车去扑火。不料敌机绕回来又打了一梭子机枪，又打着了搬下来的一桶汽油，火苗烧得有一丈多高。他不顾一切地用行李、大衣，裹着雪去救火，终于抢救了大部分物资，事后才发觉手烧伤了。他说：“在最危险的情况下完成上级交下的任务，正是共产党员应有的优秀品质。”
    二十二岁的司机同志沈荣国，因为超额完成任务立了大功。规定二十天跑两趟的行程，他却在十五天跑了四趟半，每天经常行驶十一小时。他最近收到家中来信，知道家里受到政府的优待照顾，这更鼓舞了他的工作热情。最近他患痢疾，也仍然坚持工作。
    司机班长程德显与董秀沄、李成祥、夏善久，他们把物资安全送到前线后，在山沟里发现五位重伤员。程德显立即领着三个同志把伤员小心地抬到车上，给他们盖好被子，谨慎地拉回来。在路上伤员没饭吃，他们把自己的干粮和菜给伤员吃。行车六夜，到住处时他们就把有火炕的暖房给伤员住，大小便由四个人接着倒。伤员们的衣服被雨淋湿，他们把它用火给烤干。这样，他们一直把伤员送到医院里。
    志愿援朝的司机同志们过着全世界汽车驾驶工人最艰苦的生活，但也享有最高的荣誉。人们将永远不会忘却司机同志在正义战争中的不朽功勋。
