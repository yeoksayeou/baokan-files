Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 17th: The National Railway Union and over 5,000 representatives from all sectors of Wuhan held a public trial on the 16th at the Jiang'an Railway Station in Hankou for Zhao Jixian, the main culprit in the "February 7th" massacre twenty-eight years ago. After the public trial, Zhao Jixian was executed at the very spot where Martyr Lin Xiangqian was murdered in the "February 7th" incident.

At 8:55 AM, Zhao Jixian was escorted into the public trial venue. Zhang Xuetao, President of the Wuhan Municipal People's Court and Presiding Judge of the Provisional People's Tribunal of the public trial, announced the opening of the court. Wu Jie, Deputy Chief Prosecutor of the Wuhan Municipal People's Procuratorate, first presented the indictment, listing Zhao Jixian's crimes in instigating the "February 7th" massacre of the Beijing-Hankou Railway in 1923, and requested the People's Tribunal to sentence Zhao Jixian to death in accordance with the Regulations for the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries. Subsequently, veteran workers from the "February 7th" incident and family members of the martyred, who had suffered persecution by Zhao Jixian, testified one after another, accusing Zhao Jixian of his murderous crimes. Zheng Guojun, a veteran worker from the Zhengzhou Locomotive Depot, said: "In January 1923, our Beijing-Hankou Railway workers, unable to endure the tyrannical rule, organized the Beijing-Hankou Railway General Labor Union under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. At that time, this insidious and treacherous Zhao Jixian, on the one hand, feigned permission for us to change our regular Sunday holiday of January 28th to February 1st, so that our fellow workers could participate in the founding conference of the General Labor Union; on the other hand, he secretly telegraphed the warlord Wu Peifu, plotting to strangle the establishment of the workers' organization. On February 1st, Wu Peifu sent troops to surround the venue of our General Labor Union's founding conference, forcing us to dissolve the conference. However, the workers persisted unyieldingly and courageously held the opening ceremony amidst the military encirclement. Under this extremely unreasonable oppression, the General Labor Union, on the evening of that day, accepted the unanimous request of the attending representatives and decided to implement a general strike of all railway workers on February 4th. On the fourth day of the strike, it was met with the bloody suppression of this executioner – bandit Zhao Jixian. Hundreds of workers were killed and injured along the entire line, and more than a thousand workers were forced to become displaced, causing many workers to be ruined and their families destroyed." Zheng Guojun pointed angrily at Zhao Jixian and said: "Today, your end has come. We demand that the People's Government execute you, this bloodthirsty culprit, to avenge the martyrs who died in the 'February 7th' incident!" Chen Guizhen, the wife of "February 7th" Martyr Lin Xiangqian, came specially from Fuzhou to participate in the public trial. She said: "My husband's blood was not shed in vain. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the motherland has been liberated, and we have turned over. Now, I want to see with my own eyes this executioner who murdered my husband brought to justice before the people." After her husband, Martyr Lin Caiyong, was killed, Mei Huiqing, his wife, became a nun at the age of twenty because she could not bear the persecution. She said at the public trial: "Today, the People's Government has avenged me. From now on, I want to take off my kasaya and join the work of the railway union." (Her wish has already been fulfilled, and the Zhengzhou District Committee of the China Railway Union has approved her request.) Zhang Shihan and Lü Zhixing, veteran "February 7th" workers from Jiang'an Station, and Wu Yanrong, the daughter of Wu Zhen, a "February 7th" martyr from Changxindian, successively accused Zhao Jixian of causing their families to be ruined and destroyed. Those present unanimously shouted: "Shoot Zhao Jixian to avenge the dead martyrs!"

After the accusations by the victimized workers and family members of the deceased martyrs were completed, the presiding judge began the interrogation. Because the evidence was conclusive, Zhao Jixian admitted to the criminal facts without denial. The presiding judge immediately announced that Zhao Jixian was sentenced to death, deprived of his political rights for life, and all his property, except for a portion reserved for the living expenses of his family, was confiscated. Wu Defeng, the Mayor of Wuhan, announced on the spot the approval of the presiding judge's verdict. At this point, this executioner, whose hands were stained with the blood of the people, was escorted to the site where Lin Xiangqian and other martyrs were killed and executed by firing squad.

In the afternoon of the same day, all the representatives held a public memorial meeting for the "February 7th" martyrs. Wu Defeng, the Mayor of Wuhan and the principal officiant, said in his speech: "Today, the deep-seated hatred of our Beijing-Hankou Railway workers has been settled. This is a great victory achieved under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao." He called on the railway worker representatives present to inherit the great spirit of the "February 7th" martyrs, to do a good job in the democratic reform of the railway system, and to consolidate the victory of the revolution.

　　全国铁路工会和武汉人民代表
    公审“二七”惨案主要凶犯
    赵匪继贤在林祥谦烈士被害处执行枪决
    【新华社汉口十七日电】全国铁路工会和武汉市各界人民代表共五千多人，十六日在汉口江岸火车站公审二十八年前制造“二七”惨案的主要凶犯赵匪继贤。公审大会后，赵匪即在当年“二七”杀害林祥谦烈士的地方伏法。
    上午八时五十五分，赵匪继贤被押进公审大会会场。武汉市人民法院院长兼公审大会临时人民法庭审判长张雪涛宣布开庭。武汉市人民检察署副检察长吴杰首先提起公诉，列举了赵匪在一九二三年制造京汉铁路“二七”惨案的罪行，要求人民法庭依据惩治反革命条例将赵匪判处死刑。接着，曾受赵匪迫害的“二七”老工人和死难烈士家属纷纷作证，控诉赵匪的杀人罪行。郑州机务段老工人郑国钧说：“一九二三年一月，我们京汉铁路工人因为不堪暴虐统治，在中国共产党领导下，组织京汉铁路总工会。当时，这个阴险奸诈的赵继贤，一方面假意允许我们把一月二十八日的星期日例假改在二月一日，以便工友们参加总工会的成立大会；另一方面却暗中打电报给军阀吴佩孚，阴谋扼杀工人组织的成立。二月一日，吴佩孚派兵包围了我们总工会成立大会的会场，强迫我们把大会解散。但是工人们坚持不屈，在军队包围中英勇地举行了开幕式。在这种极端无理的压迫下，总工会在当天晚上接受到会代表的一致要求，决定在二月四日实行全路工人同盟总罢工。罢工的第四天，就遭到了这个刽子手——赵匪继贤的血腥镇压。全路被打死、打伤的工人有数百人，另有一千多工人被迫流离失所，很多工人被害得家破人亡。”郑国钧愤怒地指着赵匪继贤说：“今天你活到头了，我们要求人民政府枪毙你这个杀人不眨眼的罪魁，替‘二七’死难烈士报仇！”“二七”烈士林祥谦的夫人陈桂贞特地从福州赶来参加公审大会。她说：“我丈夫的血没有白流，在毛主席和共产党的领导下，祖国已经获得解放，我们已经翻了身。现在，我要亲眼看着这个杀害我丈夫的刽子手在人民面前伏法。”烈士林材咏的夫人梅慧清在她丈夫遇难以后，因不堪迫害，从二十岁起就当了尼姑。她在公审大会上说：“今天，人民政府替我报了仇了，从现在起，我要脱掉袈裟，参加铁路工会的工作。”（她的志愿已经实现了，中国铁路工会郑州区委员会已经批准她的要求。）江岸车站“二七”老工人张士汉、吕志兴和长辛店“二七”死难烈士吴珍的女儿吴艳荣，先后控诉了赵匪继贤害得他们家破人亡的罪行。到会者一致高呼：“枪毙赵继贤，为死难烈士报仇！”
    被害工人和死难烈士家属控诉完毕后，审判长开始审问。因证据确凿，赵匪对犯罪事实均直认不讳。审判长当即宣布将赵匪判处死刑，褫夺公权终身，所有财产除酌留其家属生活费用外，全部没收。武汉市市长吴德峰当场宣布批准审判长的判决。至此，这个双手沾满人民鲜血的刽子手，被绑赴林祥谦等烈士遇难处执行枪决。
    当天下午，全体代表举行了公祭“二七”死难烈士大会。主祭人武汉市市长吴德峰致词说：“今天，我们京汉铁路工人的血海深仇得到了清算，这是在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下得到的伟大胜利。”他号召到会的铁路工人代表继承“二七”先烈的伟大精神，做好铁路系统的民主改革工作，巩固革命胜利。
