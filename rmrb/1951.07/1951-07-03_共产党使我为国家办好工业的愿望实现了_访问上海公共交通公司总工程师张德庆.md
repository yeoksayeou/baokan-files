　　"The Communist Party Has Fulfilled My Wish to Run Industry Well for the Country"
    ——An Interview with Zhang Deqing, Chief Engineer of Shanghai Public Transportation Company
     Chen Ji
    For Zhang Deqing, who has been an engineer for over twenty years, his over two-decade-long aspiration – "to run industry well for the country" – has only truly begun to be realized under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

    Zhang Deqing is currently the Chief Engineer of the Shanghai Public Transportation Company. In 1923, he left the gates of Nanyang Public School (the predecessor of Jiaotong University), harboring a wish to "run industry well for the country," and went to work at the Daye Iron Mine of the Hanyeping Coal and Iron Company. At that time, he worked diligently, hoping that his country's iron production would continuously increase. Iron production did increase, with more than four hundred tons of iron flowing out of the furnace at the Daye Ironworks every day. How happy he was! But soon after, he saw these irons, which were condensed with the blood and sweat of the Chinese working people, being handed over to Japanese imperialism batch after batch. He was very sad, and he thought, "So I am serving imperialism!"

    The year before the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, at an engineers' annual meeting held in Hangzhou, someone suggested establishing a "China Motor Manufacturing Company" and hoped that Zhang Deqing would participate in this work. Zhang Deqing gladly joined this endeavor. He painstakingly studied the principles of automobile manufacturing, went to Germany to investigate the manufacturing process of automobiles, and collected various drawings. After returning to his country, he discovered that Chen Biling, the manager in charge of the "China Motor Manufacturing Company," was using the name of automobile manufacturing to buy large amounts of gold and US dollars, engaging in speculative business, and making "national crisis fortunes." Chen Biling said, "When I engage in this business, I only need a phone call, and large amounts of gold will be sent to me continuously. Why should I bother with the automobile manufacturing work, which doesn't earn much money and is strenuous?" Zhang Deqing's hope of manufacturing automobiles was thus dashed.

    After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, he was convinced that he could "build the country," so he worked hard to improve the factory's equipment, reduce worker injuries, and pay wages to workers as early as possible to prevent workers from starving due to price fluctuations. Because of this, the Kuomintang secret agents in the company attacked him vigorously, saying that his work was the worst. His classmate, Zhao Zengyu (the puppet Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau Director), also followed the secret agents' orders and publicly scolded him severely at a business meeting. He was extremely angry and argued with Zhao Zengyu. Zhao Zengyu said to him, "According to American experience, technology is not important, personnel is."

    "When can we truly dedicate our technology to the country?" Zhang Deqing searched for a way out whenever his work encountered obstacles. Later, he became a professor at a university. However, even at the university, he could not teach in peace. He saw that the highest institutions of learning were often surrounded by reactionary troops and police, and excellent students were imprisoned in batches. He was extremely pained and depressed. He thought, "When will there be a way out?"

    In May 1949, the Communist Party liberated Shanghai, bringing hope to the people of Shanghai. Zhang Deqing took the position of Chief of the Mechanical Affairs Section in the Shanghai Public Transportation Company after liberation. He saw that the revolutionary cadres were so hardworking and enduring, and the leading cadres were so humble and sincere. He saw no rampant imperialism or signs of corruption. He thought, "The time for us to serve the people has truly arrived!"

    US imperialism shamelessly blockaded Shanghai, and the source of gasoline became difficult. "Saving gasoline" became the goal of the Shanghai Public Transportation Company's employees' struggle. Zhang Deqing suggested to the administrative leaders that they try using white coal instead of gasoline and was willing to be responsible for the design work of converting automobiles. He knew that if automobiles used white coal, not only could it defeat imperialism's blockade in this area, but it could also reduce costs significantly (the cost of white coal is only one-seventh of the cost of gasoline). His suggestion was immediately approved by the higher authorities, who encouraged him: "If you have any difficulties, we will definitely solve them." For more than twenty years, Zhang Deqing had never received such encouragement from his superiors in his work. He was determined to do a good job in designing white coal vehicles. He went through books on white coal vehicle design from various countries, carefully studied them, and formulated various drawings. Next to the oil-stained automobiles under the scorching sun, he discussed, experimented, and researched the design work with workers and technicians. Once the design was successful, the automobiles had to be converted. At the time, some people objected, saying, "I've never heard of using white coal to start an automobile!" During the conversion process, there were indeed many difficulties. Zhang Deqing knew, "If it doesn't succeed, the conversion costs will be wasted a lot!" He had some concerns, but they were quickly dispelled because the General Manager of the Shanghai Public Transportation Company strongly supported him: "Do it with peace of mind, spending some money doesn't matter." He converted the first type of white coal furnace; it could not be used because the furnace body was too heavy. He converted the second type of white coal furnace; however, because it was installed on the left side of the driver's cab, it interfered with the driver's work, and this type of white coal furnace could not be used either. The people who opposed the white coal vehicle clamored even louder: "We said it wouldn't work! You see, it doesn't work! It's really wasting state property!" But the leading cadres in the company encouraged Zhang Deqing even more: "Make one more effort, and you'll succeed!" The trade union also mobilized drivers and stokers to help Zhang Deqing install the white coal furnace better. Zhang Deqing's confidence was even higher. He often worked late into the night, sometimes not even bothering to eat. Drivers and stokers also constantly told Zhang Deqing the shortcomings they discovered in actual testing. Zhang Deqing finally made the white coal vehicle.

    Zhang Deqing was so excited when he saw the white coal automobile he designed himself, carrying people from all walks of life, driving non-stop on the streets of Shanghai! Because he saw for the first time that his technology was truly dedicated to the people. At the age of fifty-one, Zhang Deqing, who had been an engineer for more than twenty years, had been pursuing the wish to "run industry well for the country" for more than twenty years, which only began to be realized today under the leadership of the Communist Party. Last year, when people elected Zhang Deqing as a representative to attend the National Congress of Model Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers and called him a people's engineer, he said: "I have never received such an honor. This is an honor given to me by the Communist Party. I thank the Chinese Communist Party."

    People say: Zhang Deqing created the white coal automobile because he had the technology. This statement is not entirely correct. Let Zhang Deqing answer this question. He said: "In the past, I also had technology, and I also wanted to make a career, but I did not succeed. Today, without the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the enthusiastic help of the working comrades, could I have created the white coal vehicle? Absolutely not! My past tragic experiences prove this point." Zhang Deqing's history shows that technology must be combined with politics; it shows that a technician can truly serve the people only under the education and cultivation of the Chinese Communist Party.

    At the National Congress of Model Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, Zhang Deqing heard Chairman Mao call on the people of the whole country to work hard to build a strong economic power. He said: "We must realize this great call." Under this great call, Zhang Deqing is working doubly hard. He created a substitute for lubricating oil, so that the supply of lubricating oil no longer faces difficulties. He is working hard to lead the design of trolleybuses, which will bring new development to Shanghai's transportation industry. The industrialized China that he dreamed of all the time in the past has begun to sprout. He knows that the enemy that hindered the industrialization of the motherland in the past has been eliminated, and the factors that hindered technological development have been eliminated. He deeply realized: "Today is the time for us to step up our efforts to work. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, we have such a great era, can we not work hard?" He looked at the photo Chairman Mao gave him and said to me: "Under the banner of Mao Zedong, engineering and technical personnel will surely create a brilliant victory!"

　　“共产党使我为国家办好工业的愿望实现了”
    ——访问上海公共交通公司总工程师张德庆
     陈迹
    当了二十多年工程师的张德庆，他的二十多年的志愿——“为国家办好工业”，在中国共产党领导下，才真正开始实现了。
    张德庆现在是上海公共交通公司总工程师。他在一九二三年走出了南洋公学（交通大学前身）的大门，就抱着一颗“为国家办好工业”的心愿，到汉冶萍煤铁厂矿公司大冶铁矿工作。那时候，他辛辛苦苦地工作着，希望祖国的铁的产量不断地增加。铁的产量是增加了，每天大冶铁厂有四百多吨铁从炉里流出来，他是多么的高兴呵！但是没有多久，他看见这些凝结着中国劳动人民的血汗的铁，却一批一批地交给日本帝国主义了。他很难过，他想“原来我是为帝国主义服务呢！”
    抗日战争爆发的前一年，在杭州召开的工程师年会上，有人建议要成立一个“中国汽车制造公司”，希望张德庆参加这一工作。张德庆欣然地参加了这一工作。他苦心地钻研有关制造汽车的原理，跑到德国考察汽车的制造程序，收集各种图样。他回到祖国以后，发现主持“中国汽车制造公司”的经理陈筚霖，是在以制造汽车的名义，大买黄金、美钞，做投机生意，发“国难财”。陈筚霖说：“我干这一行，只用一个电话，大批的黄金就源源地送到我手里，我何苦还搞那种赚不了多少钱而又费力气的汽车制造工作呢？”张德庆制造汽车的希望从此落了空。
    抗战胜利后，他满以为能够“建国”了，于是他努力于改善厂房的设备，减少工人的伤亡；并尽可能地早日发工资给工人，以免工人因物价波动而忍饥挨饿。正因为如此，公司中的国民党特务分子就对他大肆攻击，说他的工作做得最不好。他的同学——赵曾钰（伪上海市公用局局长）也遵照特务分子的命令，公然在业务会议上狠狠地辱骂他。他气愤极了，曾与赵曾钰讲理。赵曾钰对他说：“根据美国的经验，技术并不重要，重要的是人事。”
    “在什么时候，我们才能把技术真正献给祖国呢？”张德庆每当工作碰壁的时候，就这样地找寻着出路。后来他到大学里做了教授。但在大学里，还是不能安心教书。他看见最高学府常常被反动派军警包围着，优秀的学生成批地被押入牢狱，他痛心极了，苦闷极了。他心里想：“几时才能有出路呵？”
    一九四九年五月，共产党解放了上海，给上海人民带来了希望。张德庆在解放后的上海公共交通公司担任了机务处处长。他看见革命干部都是那样地刻苦耐劳，领导干部总是那样地虚心诚恳；他看不见帝国主义的横行，看不见贪污腐化的迹象。他想：“我们为人民服务的时候真来了！”
    美帝国主义无耻地封锁上海，汽油的来源困难了；“节省汽油”成了上海公共交通公司职工们奋斗的目标。张德庆向行政领导干部建议试用白煤代替汽油，并愿意负责改装汽车的设计工作。他知道，如果汽车使用白煤，不仅可以击败帝国主义在这一方面的封锁，而且可以使成本减低很多（白煤成本，只值汽油的七分之一）。他这个建议立刻得到了上级的同意，并且鼓励他：“你有什么困难，我们一定解决。”二十多年来，张德庆在工作中，从来没有得到过上级这样的鼓励。他决心做好白煤车的设计工作。他翻遍了各国关于白煤车设计的书籍，细心研究，制订各式图样，在烈日照耀下的油污的汽车旁边，和工人、技术人员讨论、实验和研究设计工作。设计成功了，就要改装汽车。当时，有人反对说：“从没听说过用白煤，来发动汽车！”在改装过程中，确有不少困难，张德庆知道：“万一不成功，改装费可要浪费不少！”他有些顾虑，但迅速地消灭了；因为上海公共交通公司总经理大力支持他：“你安心做下去，花些钱不要紧。”他改装了第一种白煤炉；因炉身太重，不能用。他又改装了第二种白煤炉；但因装在驾驶室左边，妨碍司机的工作，这一种白煤炉又不能用。反对白煤车的人更喧嚷起来：“我们说不行！你们看，不行吧！真是浪费国家财产！”但公司里的领导干部反而越发鼓励张德庆：“再努一把力，就成功了！”工会也发动司机、司炉帮助张德庆使白煤炉装得更好。张德庆的信心更高了。他常常工作到深夜，有时连饭都顾不得吃。司机和司炉也不断地把在实际试验中所发现的缺点，告诉张德庆。张德庆终于把白煤车做好了。
    张德庆看见他亲手设计的白煤汽车，载着各人界民，不停地在上海马路上行驶，他多么兴奋呵！因为他第一次看见他的技术真正献给了人民。五十一岁的张德庆，当了二十多年的工程师，追求了二十多年“为国家办好工业”的愿望，到今天在共产党领导下才开始实现。去年当人们选举张德庆为出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议代表，称他为人民工程师的时候，他说道：“我从来没有得到过这样的荣誉，这是共产党给我的荣誉，我感谢中国共产党。”
    人们说：张德庆因为有技术，所以才创造了白煤汽车。这句话没有完全说对。还是让张德庆来回答这句话吧。他说：“在过去我也有技术，我也想做一番事业，但是我没有成功。今天，要是没有中国共产党的领导，没有工人同志的热情帮助，我能创造出白煤车吗？绝对不能！我过去的惨痛遭遇就证明了这一点。”张德庆的历史，说明了技术必须与政治结合；说明了一个技术人员只有在中国共产党教育与培养下，才能真正为人民服务。
    张德庆在全国工农兵劳动模范会议上，听见毛主席号召全国人民努力建设强大的经济力量。他说：“我们必须实现这个伟大的号召。”张德庆正在在这个伟大号召下加倍努力地工作着，他创造了代机油，使机油的供应不再发生困难；他正努力领导着无轨电车的设计工作，这个工作将给上海人民交通事业带来新的发展。他过去时时刻刻梦想的工业化的中国，已开始萌芽了。他知道今天阻碍祖国工业化的敌人已被铲除，阻碍技术发展的因素已被消灭。他深深地体会到：“今天是我们加紧努力工作的时候了。我们在共产党的领导下，有了这样伟大的时代，我们能不发奋努力吗？”他看着毛主席赠给他的照片，他对我说：“在毛泽东旗帜下，工程技术人员一定会创造出辉煌的胜利！”
