　　The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government
　　Sends Letter of Condolences to Families of Martyrs and Disabled Soldiers

Dear comrades of families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, and revolutionary disabled soldiers:

The 24th anniversary of the "August 1st" Army Day is approaching. As the people of the whole country warmly welcome this festival, we sincerely remember you. We extend our highest respects and cordial greetings to you.

The great victory of the Chinese People's Revolution was achieved through the bloodshed and sacrifice of countless revolutionary martyrs and the heroic fighting of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Today, the People's Liberation Army and the People's Armed Police still stand on the front lines of defending the motherland's national defense. They are the main guarantee of the people's happy life and the country's independence and security. The Chinese People's Volunteers, fighting alongside the Korean People's Army, have struck a blow against the aggressive flames of American imperialism and played a significant role in safeguarding peace in Asia and the world. As the people of the whole country live a free and happy life, they cannot help but first think of the revolutionary martyrs who gave their lives for the people. Their selfless spirit of sacrifice is the highest standard of revolutionary morality. Glory to the immortal revolutionary martyrs! The people cannot forget the disabled soldiers who bled and were wounded in the revolutionary war, and the glorious families of revolutionary martyrs and families of revolutionary soldiers. We wish you good health!

Dear comrades of families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, and revolutionary disabled soldiers: In order to promote your honor and guarantee your livelihood, this Ministry promulgated five preferential treatment regulations on December 11, 1950, and these regulations are now being gradually implemented. On June 1 this year, the China People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea General Association issued a call to strengthen preferential treatment work, and the people in various regions responded enthusiastically, gradually forming a widespread and mass-based preferential treatment movement. Certain tendencies that once existed in some areas, such as "preferring those nearby over those far away" and "favoring those with personal connections," are also gradually being overcome. In our future preferential treatment work, we will pay special attention to the following two points:

　　1. Strengthen education on supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers, create a social atmosphere of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers, so that everyone consciously and willingly values the revolutionary armed forces, supports the People's Army, and respects and helps the families of martyrs, families of soldiers, and disabled soldiers.

　　2. Urge people's governments at all levels to lead the people to actively help you solve difficulties in production and life. In rural areas, the main task is to do a good job of plowing fields on behalf of impoverished and labor-lacking families of martyrs, families of soldiers, and disabled soldiers of the second class or above. In cities, the main task is to effectively help you organize production or introduce employment.

Dear comrades of families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, and revolutionary disabled soldiers: In order to promote the glorious revolutionary tradition, we hope that you will guard against arrogance and rashness, actively participate in production, and strive to become models for the masses in various social activities or work. At the same time, you should also write more letters to your children and husbands, encouraging them to continue to work actively and fight bravely against the enemy, and make greater contributions to the people. This is your glorious responsibility.

　  致函慰问烈军属残废军人
    【新华社二十七日讯】中央人民政府内务部，于“八一”建军节前致函慰问革命烈士家属、革命军人家属和革命残废军人。全文如下：亲爱的革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人同志们：
    “八一”建军节二十四周年到来了。当全国人民热烈地迎接这个节日的时候，我们十分诚挚地怀念着你们。谨向你们致以崇高的敬礼和亲切的慰问。
    中国人民革命的伟大胜利，是无数革命烈士的流血牺牲，和中国人民解放军的英勇战斗换来的。在今天，人民解放军和人民公安部队，仍然站在保卫祖国国防的最前线，他们是人民幸福生活和国家独立安全的主要保障。中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，打击了美帝国主义的侵略凶焰，对保卫亚洲与世界和平起了重大作用。全国人民在这过着自由幸福生活的时候，不能不首先想起为人民献出了生命的革命烈士。他们忘我的牺牲精神，是革命道德的最高标准。光荣的革命烈士们永垂不朽！人民也不能不想起在革命战争中流血负伤的残废军人同志们，和光荣的革命烈士家属、革命军人家属们。祝你们身体健康！
    亲爱的革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人同志们：为了发扬你们的荣誉，保障你们的生活，本部于一九五○年十二月十一日公布了五项优抚条例，现在这个条例正在逐渐贯彻。今年六月一日，中国人民抗美援朝总会发出了加强优抚工作的号召，各地人民热烈地响应，逐渐形成了广泛的、群众性的优抚运动。某些地区曾经存在着的“优近不优远”、“人在人情在”等偏向，也正在逐渐克服中。我们今后在优抚工作中将特别注意以下两点：
    一、加强拥军优属的教育，造成拥军优属的社会风尚，使人人自觉自愿地重视革命武装，支援人民军队，尊重并帮助烈属、军属和残废军人。
    二、督促各级人民政府领导人民积极地帮助你们解决生产和生活中的困难。在农村，主要的是对贫苦无劳动力的烈属、军属和二等以上的残废军人做好代耕工作；在城市，主要的是切实帮助你们组织生产或介绍职业。
    亲爱的革命烈士家属、革命军人家属和革命残废军人同志们：为了发扬光荣的革命传统，希望你们戒骄戒躁，积极地参加生产，争取在各种社会活动或工作中成为群众的表率。同时，还应当多给你们的子弟和丈夫写信，勉励他们继续积极地工作和奋勇地对敌人作战，为人民立更大的功劳。这是你们的光荣责任。
          中央人民政府内务部
              七月二十七日
