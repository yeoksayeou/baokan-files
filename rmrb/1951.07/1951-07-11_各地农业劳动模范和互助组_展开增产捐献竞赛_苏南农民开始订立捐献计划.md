　　Agricultural Labor Models and Mutual Aid Teams in Various Regions
    Launch Emulation Drive for Increased Production and Donations
    Farmers in Southern Jiangsu Begin Formulating Donation Plans
    Agricultural labor models and mutual aid teams in various regions have launched an emulation drive for increased production and donations. The Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team in Shanxi Province, in addition to striving to overfulfill its original high-yield plan, has further formulated specific methods for expanding agricultural and sideline production for increased production and donations: utilizing small plots of reclaimed wasteland to increase planting of late autumn crops such as naked oats and barley, and organizing animal power to transport coal during summer hoeing. All nine households in their team plan to donate 5 million yuan (old RMB) from increased income before the end of October. Zhang Fugui, Yu Qingshou, Yu Songchang, and others in Shandong Province have all made specific plans for increased production and donations, calling on farmers throughout the province to launch an emulation drive for increased production to fulfill the donation plan for the "Shandong Air Force Division." Zhang Fugui's specific plan is to improve farming techniques and open a vermicelli mill after the autumn harvest, donating 3,000 jin of corn in installments from the increased production of agriculture and sideline occupations before the end of this year. The Chen Lianzhang Mutual Aid Team in the Subei Administrative Region challenged agricultural labor models and mutual aid teams throughout the region, guaranteeing an increase of 20 jin per mu in autumn rice fields, with all twelve households in the team donating 1,000 jin of grain. The Jia Huibang Mutual Aid Team in Chuxian County, and the Lü Dongyang and Wang Jinzhuo Mutual Aid Teams in Fuyang County, in the Wanbei Administrative Region, plan to donate a total of 1,338 jin of wheat from increased production and have challenged agricultural mutual aid teams throughout the region. The Jia Huibang Mutual Aid Team's increased production plan is to hoe cotton seven times, sorghum five times, rice three times, and soybeans, etc., three times, and to universally apply fertilizer once, striving for a 20% increase in production.

    Farmers in more than ten counties in Southern Jiangsu, including Liyang, Nanhui, Jiading, Songjiang, and Wujin, have begun to formulate patriotic increased production and donation plans, with labor models in various regions playing a leading role.
    Since the middle of last month, the above counties have held farmers' representative meetings, and the total number of aircraft donated initiated by the farmers' representative meetings in various counties has reached eleven. Agricultural labor models and farmer representatives who attended the meetings actively took the lead in formulating increased production and donation plans after the meetings. Wu Zhaogeng, a labor model from Tangyin Village, Liyang County, who attended the National Labor Model Representative Conference, took the lead in formulating a plan on the 14th of last month, guaranteeing an increased production of 1,400 jin of rice, 400 jin of watermelon, 2,200 jin of muskmelon, 15 jin of cotton, and 50 jin of soybeans, and donating all of these increased agricultural crops. Under his promotion, all 155 households in the village have made plans. The whole village plans to increase production and donate a total of 17,560 jin of rice. Liu Tianyou, a labor model from Huangnitang, Jiangning County, and the mutual aid team he leads, publicized the increased production and donation plan to the farmers in the whole village after it was formulated, prompting all 82 farmers in the village to make plans.
    Many villages have launched patriotic propaganda and education when formulating donation plans. When villages in Hujia Township, Liyang County, convened village meetings to discuss the formulation of plans, propagandists and primary school teachers throughout the township voluntarily organized to carry out propaganda, explaining to the farmers the significance of patriotic increased production and donations, and doing a good job in the substitute farming work for the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers, as well as the principles of formulating and implementing patriotic covenants.

　　各地农业劳动模范和互助组
    展开增产捐献竞赛
    苏南农民开始订立捐献计划
    各地农业劳动模范、互助组展开增产捐献竞赛。山西省李顺达互助组除争取超额完成原定丰产计划外，并进一步订出扩大农业和副业生产的具体增产捐献办法：利用小块熟荒增种莜麦、大麦等晚秋作物，夏锄时组织畜力运煤。他们全组九户要在十月底以前从增加收入中捐献人民币五十万元。山东省张富贵、于青绶、于松长等都作出了增产捐献的具体计划，他们向全省农民提出为完成“山东空军师”的捐献计划而展开增产竞赛。张富贵的具体计划是：提高耕作技术，秋后开粉坊，今年年底以前从农业和副业的增产中分期捐献玉米三千斤。苏北行政区陈连章互助组向全区农业劳动模范和互助组挑战，他们保证秋季水稻田每亩增产二十斤，全组十二户捐献一千斤粮。皖北行政区滁县贾惠邦及阜阳吕东阳、王金琢等三个互助组准备从增产中捐献小麦共一千三百三十八斤，并向全区农业互助组挑战。贾惠邦互助组的增产计划是：棉花锄七遍，秫秫锄五遍，稻子耨三遍，黄豆等锄三遍，并普遍增施肥料一次，争取增产二成。

    苏南区溧阳、南汇、嘉定、松江、武进等十余县的农民，开始订立爱国增产捐献计划，各地的劳动模范起了带头的作用。
    上述各县自上月中旬以来分别举行了农民代表会议，由各县农民代表会议发起捐献的飞机总数已有十一架。参加会议的各地农业劳动模范和农民代表们，在会后积极地带头订出增产捐献计划。曾出席全国劳动模范代表会议的溧阳县棠荫村劳动模范吴兆庚，于上月十四日首先订出计划，保证增产稻子一千四百斤、西瓜四百斤、香瓜二千二百斤、棉花十五斤、黄豆五十斤，将这些增产的农作物全部捐献。在他的推动下，该村一百五十五户都订了计划。全村计划共增产捐献稻子一万七千五百六十斤。江宁县黄泥塘劳动模范刘天有和他所领导的互助组，在订出了增产捐献计划后，就向全村农民宣传，推动了全村八十二户农民也都订出计划。
    许多村庄在订立捐献计划时，展开了爱国主义宣传教育。溧阳县胡家乡各村召开村民大会讨论订立计划时，全乡的宣传员和小学教师都自动组织起来进行宣传，向农民们讲解爱国增产捐献和做好革命烈士家属和革命军人家属的代耕工作的意义，以及订立和贯彻执行爱国公约的道理。
