Xinhua News Agency, July 29th: Heroic units and combat heroes of various units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, with outstanding achievements in battle, wrote letters to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu before the "August 1st" Army Day. They unanimously expressed that as long as imperialism exists for one day, they must hold the weapons in their hands tightly and fight to defend the motherland and world peace.

These heroic units and combat heroes include: the "Red Ninth Company," established in 1929 during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War; the "Tashan Heroic Regiment," which fought the famous Tashan Blockade in the Jinzhou Campaign of the Chinese People's Liberation War; the "Xu Hanlin Platoon," named after the combat hero Xu Hanlin, who sacrificed himself to destroy an enemy bunker while suppressing bandits in Guangdong; Ge Zhenlin, one of the Five Heroes of Langya Mountain who defended Langya Mountain ten years ago; five hundred and twenty-three combat heroes of the Central-South Military Region and the Fourth Field Army; Wang Yushan, a combat hero who blocked an enemy machine gun nest with his back while suppressing bandits in Qinzhou, Guangdong; and Liang Kuiting, who won the title of Maritime Hero in the battle to liberate the Wanshan Islands.

The letter from the "Red Ninth Company" states: For twenty-two years, the "Red Ninth Company" has always stood at the forefront of the Chinese People's Revolutionary War. Under your guidance, the "Red Ninth Company" has always been praised as a model company. Since 1947 alone, it has been awarded collective merits fifteen times, won fifteen flags of honor, and produced fifteen model platoons and squads and one hundred and eight combat heroes and model workers; at the same time, our company has also transferred ninety-eight cadres above the platoon level. Therefore, the "Red Ninth Company" is also known as a training team for cultivating cadres. The letter from the "Red Ninth Company" continues: "We have been able to achieve the above results mainly because we have followed Chairman Mao's thinking on army building in our work. We have brought into play the fortress-like core role of the Communist Party branch in the company, consistently carried out proletarian ideological education and revolutionary honor tradition education for the troops, and paid timely attention to cultivating cadres, promoting democracy, and caring for soldiers, so as to achieve internal unity and consolidation." The "Red Ninth Company" finally stated: "We must study harder, build ourselves into a modern national defense force, vigilantly defend national defense, and be ready to fight to defend the motherland at any time."

The "Tashan Heroic Regiment" reported that in the five months of bandit suppression operations last year, they annihilated 3,819 bandits and seized 5,312 guns. The entire regiment drew cadres to organize nine work teams, carried out mass mobilization work in twenty-four townships, transformed one hundred and eighty-five village governments, established farmers' associations in one hundred and seventy-five villages, and helped lay a solid foundation for land reform in the area. The heroes of the "Tashan Heroic Regiment" finally stated: "As long as imperialism still exists in the world, we must hold the guns in our hands tightly to defend the motherland and defend world peace!"

Combat hero Ge Zhenlin, one of the Five Heroes of Langya Mountain who defended Langya Mountain during the Anti-Japanese War, resolutely opposed US imperialism's rearmament of Japan and illegal separate peace treaty with Japan. He stated: "I will always be a soldier who defends the motherland and defends peace, and I will bring the fighting spirit of defending Langya Mountain to wherever the motherland needs me!"

Naval combat hero Liang Kuiting, who is defending the motherland's coastal defense, stated: I am willing to always be a maritime sentinel, and strive to build a strong Chinese People's Navy and consolidate the motherland's coastal defense!

    这些英雄单位与战斗英雄有：一九二九年第二次国内革命战争时期建连的“红九连”，中国人民解放战争锦州战役中进行了名震中外的塔山阻击战的“塔山英雄团”，以在广东剿匪中舍身炸毁敌堡的战斗英雄徐汉林烈士命名的“徐汉林班”，十年前坚守狼牙山的五壮士之一、战斗英雄葛振林，中南军区暨第四野战军五百二十三位战斗英雄，在广东钦州剿匪中以背堵住敌人机枪眼的战斗英雄王玉山，与解放万山群岛战役中荣获海上英雄称号的梁魁庭。
    “红九连”的信上写道：二十二年来，“红九连”始终站在中国人民革命战争的最前线。在你们的教养下，“红九连”始终被誉为模范连队，仅从一九四七年至今，就立了十五次集体功，荣获奖旗十五面，先后出现模范班、排十五个与战斗英雄和模范工作者一百零八名；同时，我们连里还调出排以上干部九十八人，因此，“红九连”又被誉为培养干部的教导队。“红九连”的信继称：“我们能获得以上成绩，主要是遵照了毛主席的建军思想进行工作。我们发挥了连队里共产党支部的堡垒核心作用，经常贯彻对部队进行无产阶级思想教育和革命荣誉的传统教育，及时注意培养干部、发扬民主与爱护战士，达到内部的团结巩固。”“红九连”最后表示：“我们一定要更加努力学习，把自己建设成一支现代化的国防军，警惕地保卫国防，随时准备为保卫祖国而战斗。”

    抗日战争中坚守狼牙山五壮士之一的战斗英雄葛振林坚决反对美帝国主义重新武装日本和非法的对日单独媾和。他表示：“我永远做一个保卫祖国、保卫和平的战士，把坚守狼牙山的战斗精神带到祖国需要我的地方去！”
    保卫着祖国海防的海军战斗英雄梁魁庭表示：愿永远做一个海上哨兵，为建设强大的中国人民海军，为巩固祖国的海防而奋斗！
