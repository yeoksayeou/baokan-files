　　Guangdong and Guangxi Large-Scale Rent Reduction Movement Successfully Unfolds in Most Parts
    In Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, apart from the areas with a population of seven million that have already implemented land reform, large-scale rent reduction and anti-local tyrant movements are currently underway in most areas. In the rural areas of 43 counties in 8 special districts, including Qujiang, Dongjiang, and Xijiang in Guangdong Province, rent reduction is now being carried out universally. In more than 40 other counties in the province, the rent reduction movement is also gradually expanding from key villages outwards. In Guangxi Province, peasants in more than 3,800 administrative villages in the four special districts of Liuzhou, Nanning, Yulin, and Wuzhou have achieved victory in rent reduction. The rent reduction movement in Longzhou, Yishan, and other special districts is also unfolding from points to areas.
    According to rough statistics, the rent reduction movement currently underway in Guangdong Province involves a population of 10 million. Peasants have gained more than 200 million jin of grain and 2.4 billion yuan in Renminbi from the rent reduction, which can basically solve their livelihood difficulties between summer and autumn. In Guangxi Province, according to statistics from Tengxian County alone, peasants have already received more than 5 million jin of grain. The rent reduction movements in various places are closely combined with the work of opposing local tyrants, eliminating bandits, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. In Maoming County, Guangdong Province, peasants have exposed a total of more than 680 Kuomintang secret agents and bandits and seized more than 11,000 guns during this movement.
    The rent reduction movement currently underway in Guangdong and Guangxi started in April and May this year and is the largest since liberation. It is expected that before autumn this year, rent reduction will be completed in areas with a population of more than 30 million in the two provinces, and land reform can be further implemented this winter and next spring.

　　广东广西大部地区
    减租运动胜利展开
    广东和广西两省的农村除已有七百万人口的地区实行了土地改革以外，目前正在大部地区展开大规模的减租和反恶霸运动。广东省曲江、东江、西江等八个专区四十三个县的农村，现正普遍进行减租；该省另四十多县的减租运动也正从重点乡村逐步向外扩展。广西省柳州、南宁、郁林、梧州等四个专区有三千八百多个行政村的农民已经取得了减租的胜利；龙州、宜山等专区的减租运动也正由点到面展开。
    据约略统计：广东省目前正在进行减租的地区已达一千万人口，农民从减租中，已得到粮食二亿多斤和人民币二十四亿元，大体可以解决夏秋之间的生活困难。广西省仅藤县一个县的统计，农民就已得到了五百多万斤粮食的果实。各地的减租运动，都是密切地结合着反对恶霸、清除土匪和镇压反革命等工作进行的。广东省茂名县农民，在这次运动中间，前后共检举了六百八十多个国民党特务和土匪，收缴了一万一千多支枪。
    广东和广西目前正进行着的减租运动，是从今年四五月间先后开始的，是解放以来规模最大的一次。预计今年秋前，两省将有三千多万人口的地区完成减租，今冬明春就可进一步实行土地改革。
