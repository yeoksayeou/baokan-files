　　Resolutely Rely on Workers to Abolish the Feudal Contractor System!
    The incident at the Laizhen Project Office in Guangxi, under the Hengyang Railway Bureau, where feudal contractors cruelly exploited workers, leading to deaths, is a serious lesson for current construction projects. The Laizhen Project Office in Guangxi completely entrusted the fate of over 30,000 workers to feudal contractors. The workers suffered cruel exploitation, some even starving to death, yet the Project Office remained unaware for a long time. Where did the class viewpoints of these comrades go? How can work be done well if they don't rely on the workers but instead rely on feudal contractors? Of course, relying on workers is a bit more "troublesome," requiring organization and education, far less trouble than simply handing everything over to feudal contractors. However, the result of relying on feudal contractors is that the project will certainly not be done well, and the workers will certainly suffer greatly. This lesson has been repeated countless times throughout the country. Now is the time to thoroughly accept past lessons and change our thinking and style of work.
    The Laizhen Project Office has already filed charges with the people's judicial organs against certain feudal contractors who illegally exploit and oppress workers, and has organized workers to struggle against feudal contractors. This is absolutely necessary. The people's judicial organs will certainly punish these feudal contractors severely according to the law. The people's government and the people's laws absolutely do not allow feudal contractors to act recklessly in this way.

　　坚决依靠工人废除封建包工制度！
    衡阳铁路管理局所属广西来镇工程处所发生的封建包商残酷剥削以致害死工人的事件，是当前建筑工程中一个严重的教训。广西来镇工程处把三万多工人的命运，完全交到封建包商手中，工人受了残酷的剥削，有的甚至饿死了，工程处却长期不知道。这些同志的阶级观点跑到那里去了呢？不依靠工人，而依靠封建包商，工作怎么能作好呢？当然，依靠工人，是比较“麻烦”一些，要组织，要教育，远不如一手推给封建包商省事，但是，依靠封建包商的结果，工程一定作不好，工人一定吃大亏，这种教训，在全国已经重复了多少遍，现在是彻底接受过去教训，改变自己的思想与作风的时候了。
    来镇工程处对于某些非法剥削压迫工人的封建包商，已向人民司法机关提出控诉，并组织工人向封建包商进行斗争，这是完全必要的。人民司法机关定将依法给这些封建包商以严厉的惩处。人民的政府和人民的法纪，是绝对不允许封建包商这样胡作非为的。
