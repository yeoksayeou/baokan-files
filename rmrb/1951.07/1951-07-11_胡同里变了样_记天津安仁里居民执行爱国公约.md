　　The Hutong Has Changed
    ——Residents of Anren Lane in Tianjin Implement the Patriotic Pact
    (Xinhua News Agency Reporter Zhao Yuxin)
    Yang Shouming, a small businessman living in Anren Lane, Eleventh District of Tianjin, had a wife who died of illness in May of this year, leaving behind a baby, Yang Rong, who was less than eight months old. He was very worried: "I can't afford a wet nurse, and I'll have to watch this child starve to death!" Unexpectedly, at this time, seven or eight women from neighboring courtyards, including Aunt Gao and Sister Wu, who were breastfeeding their own children, came to offer to feed his child. Little Yang Rong was taken away and cared for by them in shifts day and night, and grew even stronger than before. Yang Shouming was able to continue his business in the city. He said: "The Patriotic Pact saved my little Yang Rong's life!"
    Indeed, since the establishment of the Patriotic Pact, the residents of Anren Lane have become as close as family. This Patriotic Pact was jointly established by all 124 households in the lane at the end of April this year. The first article is to ensure the study of current affairs and culture, so that the work of resisting America and aiding Korea in the lane is regularized. Second, to carefully monitor the controlled elements; to immediately report any suspected elements to the police station. Third, to attend meetings without fail, and ask the household registration representative for leave if there is a matter. Fourth, each household maintains cleanliness and hygiene, and ensures unity and mutual assistance, no quarrels, no gambling. After they established the Patriotic Pact, a group leader was selected from each courtyard to be responsible for checking and supervising the implementation of the Patriotic Pact in their courtyard. Every Saturday, all the residents of the lane hold a Patriotic Pact inspection meeting to summarize the achievements and shortcomings of the Patriotic Pact's implementation over the past week. Because the Patriotic Pact was discussed and established by themselves, as long as a notice is given, they can all arrive within twenty minutes for the big meetings and small meetings. At each Patriotic Pact inspection meeting, without notice, there are always more than a hundred people attending. Everyone actively speaks at the meeting, conducting criticism and praise. After the meeting, the things that were praised and criticized are published on the blackboard newspaper.
    The residents of Anren Lane are now very attentive to floating populations. Once, the Wang family had relatives from the countryside who did not register their household, and people in the same courtyard criticized them. The Wang family member also made a self-criticism at the regular meeting. In mid-June, Ni Hongyu, a housewife in the lane, also reported a relative of a traitorous bully who had fled from Wuqiao County to Tianjin.
    They established a literacy class and a newspaper reading group in the lane, with four or five literate housewives in the lane serving as volunteer teachers. Now there are more than fifty women who come to study culture every morning while their children are still asleep. The newspaper reading group is even more lively, with more than a hundred people participating each time. They all like to hear about the heroic deeds of the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean front and the stories of some model figures in the city. Many old ladies in the big courtyards often hold small meetings in the courtyards to discuss the stories after hearing them.
    In the past, although everyone was neighbors who met as soon as they got out of bed, they were unrelated and had no contact with each other. Since the establishment of the Patriotic Pact and hearing many stories of unity and mutual assistance in the newspaper reading group, all the residents of the lane have also begun to pay attention to unity and mutual assistance. Resident Ning Tongquan discovered that his doorway had already been swept by someone else when he came out to sweep the alley in the morning, and from then on, he got up early every day to rush to sweep the alley. An old woman named Liu lives at the north end of the alley. In the past, she loved to play cards the most and was also accustomed to quarreling with her daughter-in-law, which disturbed the neighbors. Now she no longer gambles or quarrels. Every day, she carries her grandson happily to find her daughter-in-law who works in the cigarette factory to breastfeed. When others asked her, "How did you change your old temper?" She said, "Our volunteers are fighting on the front lines, eating snow and fried noodles, so that we can live a good life. If we have a good life and don't live it well, quarreling all day long, is that human?"
    Last month, the people in the lane added two new items to the Patriotic Pact: donating airplanes and artillery, and doing a good job in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen. Everyone is busy making donation plans. On the Dragon Boat Festival, they also prepared gifts such as zongzi and pork, and sent them to the five families of servicemen in the lane with gongs and drums. The family member of a volunteer, Old Lady Lu, was so moved that she wrote a letter to her son saying, "Don't worry about home, the government and neighbors are taking good care of us. Since the establishment of the Patriotic Pact in Anren Lane, the whole alley has become a family. Kill more American devils to repay everyone's kindness!"

### 胡同里变了样  ——记天津安仁里居民执行爱国公约

　　胡同里变了样
    ——记天津安仁里居民执行爱国公约
    （新华社记者  赵玉昕）
    天津市第十一区安仁里的居民杨守明，是个做小买卖的。今年五月间他妻子生病死了，撇下不满八个月的娃娃杨荣。他心里直发愁：“咱又雇不起奶母，要眼看着这孩子饿死喽！”谁知道，这时候邻院的高家大婶、吴大嫂等七、八位奶着孩子的妇女都来了，争着要替他喂孩子。小杨荣被抱走了，由她们白天、黑夜地轮流着抚育，长得比先前还结实些。杨守明可以照旧到市上做生意。他说：“爱国公约救了俺小杨荣的命！”
    真的，自从订立了爱国公约以后，安仁里的居民都亲似一家人了。这个爱国公约是在今年四月底，由全里一百二十四户居民共同订立的，第一条是保证学习时事和文化，使本里的抗美援朝工作经常化。第二、要小心监视被管制分子；发现嫌疑分子立即报告公安局派出所。第三、开会必须参加，有事情向户政代表请假。第四、每户保持清洁卫生，并保证团结互助，不口角、不赌钱。他们订立了爱国公约以后，每个院子里选出一个小组长，负责检查督促本院爱国公约的执行。每星期六全里居民开一次爱国公约检查大会，总结一周来执行爱国公约的成绩和缺点。因为爱国公约是他们自己讨论订立的，所以开大会、开小会，只要一声通知，二十分钟内一定能到齐。在每次检查爱国公约的例会上，不要通知，总有百余人出席。大家在会上都积极发言，进行批评和表扬。会后，又把表扬和批评的事情公布在黑板报上。
    安仁里的居民现在对于流动户口都很注意。有一次，王家来了乡亲没有报户口，同院的人就提出批评，姓王的在例会上也作了检讨。六月中旬，该里家庭妇女倪红玉还检举了一个由吴桥县潜逃天津的汉奸恶霸的亲戚。
    他们在本里内建立了一个识字班和一个读报组，由里内四、五位识字的家庭妇女担任义务教员。现在已有五十多位妇女，每天早晨趁着孩子未醒时来学习文化。读报组更是热闹，每次都有一百多个人参加。他们都喜欢听朝鲜前线中国人民志愿军的英勇事迹，和本市一些模范人物的故事。许多大院里的老大娘们，常常听过了故事还在院子里开个小会讨论讨论。
    以前，大家虽然是下了炕就见面的近邻，但是互不相关，并没有什么往来。自从订了爱国公约，在读报组中又听到不少团结互助的故事以后，全里居民也开始注意团结互助了。居民宁统泉早晨出来扫胡同时，发现自己的门口已被别人扫过了，他以后便每天老早起来抢着扫胡同。胡同北头住着个刘大娘，以前最爱斗牌，又惯和儿媳妇吵嘴，吵起来四邻不安。现在已经不赌博、不吵架了，每天笑嘻嘻地背着孙子去找在烟厂做工的儿媳喂奶。别人问她：“怎么改了老脾气？”她说：“咱们志愿军在前方吃雪吃炒面打仗，是为了咱能过好日子的，咱有了好日子再不好好过，整天吵吵闹闹的，那还有人味吗？”
    上个月，该里人民又在爱国公约上增加了捐献飞机大炮、做好拥军优属工作两项新内容。大家忙着订捐献计划。农历端午节那天，他们还准备了粽子、猪肉等礼物，打着锣鼓送给里内的五家军人家属。志愿军家属吕老太太感动得写信对儿子说：“你不要挂念家，政府和邻居们都很照顾咱们。安仁里自从订立爱国公约以后，全胡同变成了一家人，你多杀几个美国鬼子，来报答大家的好心吧！”
