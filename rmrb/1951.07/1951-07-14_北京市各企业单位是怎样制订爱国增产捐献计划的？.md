Editor's Note: The formulation of production increase and donation plans by leading cadres and workers in some state-owned enterprises in Beijing, and the development of a planned and step-by-step mass movement on this basis, is a correct approach. The benefits are: First, the goal of striving for increased production and donations can become part of the patriotic pledge, further enhancing the patriotic production enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers. Second, it can reduce the blindness of mass production increase and donation, promote mass production improvement in a planned way, and strive to overfulfill the state's overall production plan and increase revenue.

More than two-thirds of the 21 larger enterprises in Beijing have initially formulated their plans for patriotic production increase and donation for the second half of the year (some only have production increase plans at this stage), and are conducting inspection, revision, and implementation of the patriotic pledges in conjunction with this. This ensures the continued advancement of the patriotic donation movement in the future, and closely integrates the donation movement with the production work of each unit, thereby correcting the tendency in some units in the early stages of the donation movement to focus only on donating wages, engaging in side businesses, and engaging in amateur voluntary labor, while neglecting or relaxing the main tasks of completing production tasks, improving quality, and reducing costs.

The initial experiences of each unit in formulating patriotic production increase and donation plans are:

(1) Conduct in-depth patriotic propaganda and education work, and mobilize the masses to come up with ideas and methods. When the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau formulated its patriotic production increase and donation plan, it first discussed it at the General Branch Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and determined the policy of expanding business, increasing revenue, saving expenses, reducing costs, and striving to overfulfill the task of turning over profits to the state. Then, the administration submitted this opinion to the Standing Committee Enlarged Meeting of the Enterprise Management Committee for study. At the same time, the trade union held a forum for technical personnel and labor models, and extensively mobilized workers to launch a week-long "brainstorming" campaign. The leaders then collected these methods, and the Party, government, and trade union jointly formed a research group to sort out and analyze them. At the same time, they went deep into the lower levels, directly and repeatedly studying with the responsible cadres of the current business units, carefully calculated, and drafted a draft plan, which was finally submitted to the workers' representative meeting for discussion and revision. All the representatives unanimously adopted this plan: to strive to overfulfill the administrative task of turning over 3.7 billion yuan to the state in 1951. Both leaders and the masses expressed their determination and confidence in achieving this.

(2) Identify the main key issues of production increase, determine the goals to strive for, and stipulate the methods to achieve them: The content of the production increase and donation plan should basically include two parts: First, realistic production increase goals; Second, specific methods to achieve them. The Beijing Electric Power Bureau first studied the business situation and found that over-fulfilling the electricity sales task was the most effective way to increase excess surplus for the state, so it decided to focus on this when formulating the plan. Based on past business conditions and future conditions, they determined to strive to over-sell 5.39 million kilowatt-hours of electricity. In addition to other income, the total excess surplus in half a year could reach 6 billion yuan, equivalent to the price of four fighter planes. To achieve this plan, they decided to take a series of measures: such as, in terms of engineering, completing new installation, expansion, deployment, and maintenance projects in advance to expand power supply, reduce line losses, and improve equipment utilization; in terms of business, strengthening parallel meters, meter replacement, adjusting load curves, and opening up the reporting of completion of power projects; in terms of management, strengthening the implementation of the economic accounting system, compressing working capital, further clearing up assets, and repairing waste products. The North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, based on the cost analysis of plows, the production potential of workers and equipment, and technical conditions, determined to reduce costs by 10% in the second half of the year, and to overproduce 2,000 plows, increasing the surplus for the state by more than 489 million yuan. In order to ensure the implementation of these plans, the factory established specialized institutions under the Donation Committee, such as the Technical Materials Group, the Production Cost Reduction Group, the Management Cost Reduction Group, and the Labor Organization Group, to promptly identify problems and study solutions. The Changxindian Railway Factory planned to save expenses and take various technical improvement measures, as well as save materials and utilize waste materials, and could generate an excess surplus of more than 13 billion yuan in the second half of the year.

(3) The formulation of a plant-wide production increase and donation plan must be combined with the revision of patriotic pledges and the development of competitions to ensure completion. The Shijingshan Power Plant, in conjunction with the plant-wide patriotic safety and production increase plan, adopted the methods of typical demonstration, group discussion, and leadership review to universally inspect and revise the patriotic pledges, overcoming the shortcomings of the past patriotic pledges, which were abstract, fragmented, and lacking an overall goal for the entire plant. Everyone has incorporated specific methods for increasing production, saving money, and eliminating accidents into the pledges. Now, the entire plant is taking the plan to create 1.5 billion yuan of wealth for the state as its goal, and is launching a patriotic competition based on groups, and there is full confidence that the plan will be achieved. The Telecommunications Bureau has also revised its patriotic pledges and launched a competition. The staff of the Traffic Office has now come up with 147 methods, which have become a powerful guarantee for the completion of the patriotic production increase plan.

(4) Strengthen propaganda and mobilization work, and conduct regular inspections and summaries. Propaganda and mobilization are powerful weapons for promoting the production increase and donation movement. The Agricultural Machinery General Factory and other factories have established specialized propaganda institutions under the Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Donation Committee to unify planning and promote propaganda and mobilization work throughout the plant. The Shijingshan Power Plant also printed "Propaganda and Mobilization Tickets" for groups, so that the factory and workshop committees could regularly grasp the situation of the masses, promptly commend advanced figures, introduce experiences, and criticize backward ones and correct shortcomings. Units such as the People's Printing Factory have established a monthly inspection and summary system, so that the production increase and donation work can be improved step by step, and the patriotic enthusiasm of the workers can be consolidated and enhanced, so that they can consciously strive to complete and exceed the production increase and donation plan.

　　北京市各企业单位是怎样制订爱国增产捐献计划的？
    编者按：北京市部分国营企业领导职工制订增产捐献计划，并在这一基础上形成有计划、有步骤的群众运动，这是正确的作法。它的好处是：一，可以把增产捐献的奋斗目标成为爱国公约的一部分，进一步提高广大职工群众的爱国生产热情。第二，可以减少群众增产捐献的盲目性，有计划地推动群众提高生产，为争取超额完成国家总的生产计划和增加收入而斗争。
    北京全市二十一个较大企业中，已有三分之二以上的单位初步订出了下半年的全厂的爱国增产捐献计划（其中有的现在还只有增产计划），并与此相结合开展了检查、修订与贯彻执行爱国公约的竞赛运动。这样，就保证了今后爱国捐献运动的继续推进，并使捐献运动与各单位的生产工作紧密结合，从而纠正了捐献运动初期某些单位只着重捐工资、搞副业、搞业余义务劳动，反而忽视或放松了完成生产任务、提高质量、降低成本等主要工作的倾向。
    各单位在制订爱国增产捐献计划中的初步经验是：
    （一）深入进行爱国主义的宣传教育工作，发动群众出主意，想办法。北京电信局制订爱国增产捐献计划时，首先在中共总支委员会上进行了讨论，确定了扩大业务、增加收入、节约开支、降低成本，争取超额完成上缴任务的方针。然后由行政把这一意见提到企业管理委员会常委扩大会议上进行研究。同时，工会召开了技术人员、劳动模范座谈会，并广泛发动职工展开了为时一周的“想办法”运动，领导上将这些办法集中起来后，由党、政、工三方面组成研究组加以整理分析，同时深入下层，直接与现业单位负责干部反复研究，周密计算，拟出计划草案，最后提到职工代表会议上讨论修正。全体代表一致通过了此一计划：为争取超额完成一九五一年行政上缴任务三十七亿元而奋斗。领导与群众都表示有决心、有把握实现。
    （二）找出增产的主要关键问题，确定奋斗目标，规定实现办法：增产捐献计划内容基本上应包括两部分，一、切合实际的增产奋斗目标；二、具体实现的办法。北京电业局首先根据业务情况，研究出超额完成售电任务是为国家增加超额盈余的最有效方法，因之即确定以此为中心来拟订计划。他们根据过去业务情况及今后条件，确定以超额售电五百三十九万度为奋斗目标，加上其他收入，半年中全部超额盈余可达六十亿元，相当于四架战斗机的价格。为了实现这一计划，他们决定采取一系列的措施：如在工务方面，提前完成新装、增装、调配、检修工程以扩大供电，减少线路损失，提高设备利用率；在业务方面，加强并表、换表，调整负荷曲线及开放电力催报竣工工作；在管理方面，加强执行经济核算制，压缩流动资金，进一步清理资财，修复废品等。华北农业机械总厂根据犁的成本分析，职工和设备的生产潜力与技术条件等，确定下半年降低成本百分之十，并超额生产二千部犁，为国家增加盈余四亿八千九百余万元。为了保证实现这些计划，该厂在捐献委员会下分设技术材料组、生产费用减低组、管理费用减低组、劳动组织组等专门机构，及时发现问题，研究解决。长辛店铁路工厂计划节省开支，并采取各种改进技术的措施以及节约材料，利用废料等，下半年可超额盈余一百三十余亿元。
    （三）订立全厂增产捐献计划，必须与修订爱国公约相结合，开展竞赛，才能保证完成。石景山发电厂结合全厂爱国安全、增产计划，采取典型示范、小组讨论、领导审查的方法，普遍检查修订了爱国公约，克服了过去爱国公约内容抽象、零碎，全厂没有一个总的奋斗目标的缺点，大家把增产、节约、消灭事故的具体办法都订在公约里。现在全厂正以为国家多创造十五亿元财富的计划为目标，以小组为基础，展开了爱国竞赛，计划的实现已有了充分把握。电信局也修订了爱国公约，展开了竞赛，话务处职工现已想出一百四十七种办法，成为完成爱国增产计划的有力保证。
    （四）加强宣传、鼓动工作，定期检查总结。宣传鼓动是推动增产捐献运动的有力武器，农业机械总厂等在抗美援朝捐献委员会下，均设了专门的宣传机构，统一计划、推动全厂的宣传鼓动工作。石景山发电厂还印制了小组“宣传鼓动票”，使工厂、车间委员会能经常掌握群众情况，及时表扬先进人物，介绍经验，并批评落后的，纠正缺点。人民印刷厂等单位都建立了每月一次的检查总结制度，使增产捐献工作能步步提高，并巩固、提高职工的爱国热情，自觉地为完成超过增产捐献计划而奋斗。
