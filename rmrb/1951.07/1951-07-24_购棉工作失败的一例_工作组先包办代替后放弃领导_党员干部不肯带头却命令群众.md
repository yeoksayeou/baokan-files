A Case of Failed Cotton Procurement

　　The Work Team First Took Over Everything, Then Abandoned Leadership

　　Party Members and Cadres Refused to Take the Lead but Ordered the Masses

　　Mi Rongyun

　　In Linlibao, the first district of Cheng'an County, Handan Special District, the cotton purchasing demonstration work team committed the mistake of taking over everything at the beginning of the cotton purchasing and storage work. Later, the village cadres used coercive methods, and the work team did not correct them, showing a tailism tendency. As a result, the work failed.

　　Linlibao Village planted 2,400 mu of cotton last year, producing about 360,000 jin of seed cotton. According to the survey by the county people's government, the masses still have at least 70,000 jin of cotton in storage, excluding what has been sold. After the Handan Special District cotton purchasing demonstration work team arrived in the village on June 15, it held a series of meetings for the CCP branch committee, party members and cadres, and the masses for four consecutive days, generally talking about the cotton purchasing and storage policy, and then considered the propaganda work to be mature. The work team personally wrote and asked the masses to register their cotton sales. Only then did they discover that even the village cadres' thinking had not been straightened out. Zhang Wenguang, the CCP branch secretary, and Zhang Bing, the militia instructor, jointly ran a flower shop in the village. Because the cotton selling and storing tasks hindered their personal interests, they were passive and unenthusiastic about the cotton selling and storing work. Branch committee members Zhang Shufang and Wang Fengming, and four others, secretly transported more than 700 jin of stored cotton to the city to store it after hearing that they were supposed to report their stored cotton. The masses had many more doubts about selling and storing cotton: most of the masses were afraid of revealing their wealth, while others were afraid that the procedures for withdrawing money from the bank would be troublesome, and that they would not be able to buy anything after selling the cotton. Therefore, they all watched and waited, without reporting or underreporting.

　　Later, the work team reviewed that the work method of taking over everything was wrong, and completely handed over the cotton selling and storing task to the village cadres. Because the ideological mobilization of the village cadres was not mature enough, the village cadres neither led the masses with their own exemplary behavior nor publicized well to the masses, but simply asked the masses to compete in selling cotton and let the masses set the conditions to guarantee completion. During the discussion in Zhang Dawei's group, cotton farmers questioned branch committee member Zhang Wenhua: "The government calls on us to sell cotton, why don't you report your 300 jin of stored cotton? Our whole group challenges you!" Zhang Wenhua retorted: "I still keep my cotton for wearing!" When Zhang Jinming's group organized the masses to discuss, village cadre Zhang Shuxun asked: "What should be done if someone has stored cotton but does not sell it?" He asked everyone to express their attitude. Some said: "Limit three days to sell all the cotton, and if it is found that there is stored cotton that is not sold after the deadline, it will be confiscated and turned over to the public." Others said: "If it is found out, they will be made to wear tall hats and paraded through the streets." Some groups even made the masses write and sign pledges. After this happened, some cadres of the work team believed that this was a "spontaneous challenge by the masses" and not "coercion." As a result, because the ideological concerns of the masses were not resolved, many cotton farmers did not dare to publicly sell cotton. Although some cotton farmers challenged and set conditions, they did not take out the cotton.

Editor's Note: From the failure of the cotton purchasing and storage work in Linlibao, Cheng'an, Hebei, what lessons should we learn and what issues should we pay attention to? First, the cotton purchasing work team and other cadres sent to the countryside to carry out this work must pay attention to the specific ideological problems existing among the basic-level party members, cadres, and farmers, carry out in-depth propaganda and education on these ideological problems, and effectively resolve them, and break the cotton farmers' concerns that they will not be able to buy things after selling cotton with a sufficient supply of materials, and not stop at the propaganda of general principles and general policies. In particular, it is necessary to effectively straighten out the thinking of party members and cadres, and through them, carry out propaganda to the vast number of farmers, and lead the masses with their own exemplary behavior. The work team and the superior cadres taking over everything or abandoning leadership will lead to the failure of the work.

Second, party members who cannot respond to the call of the government and the Party, cannot play an exemplary role, and only know how to implement coercive orders to the masses must be strictly criticized and educated to enable them to quickly correct their mistakes, restore the Party's prestige among the masses, and enable the work to proceed smoothly. Party members who are unwilling to correct their mistakes and cannot subordinate their personal interests to the interests of the Party and the people should be subject to disciplinary sanctions in accordance with the provisions of the Party Constitution.

　　购棉工作失败的一例
    工作组先包办代替后放弃领导
　  党员干部不肯带头却命令群众

    河北邯郸专区收棉示范工作组在成安县一区林里堡开展购棉储棉工作中，开头犯了包办代替的毛病；后来村干部使用了强迫命令方式，工作组不加纠正，表现了尾巴主义倾向。结果，工作失败了。
    林里堡村去年种棉二千四百亩，约产籽棉三十六万多斤。根据该县人民政府的调查，群众的棉花除卖了的以外，目前至少还存七万斤左右。邯郸专区收棉示范工作组六月十五日到这村后，经过一连四天召开中共支委会、党员干部会、群众大会，一般地谈了一下购棉储棉政策，便认为宣传工作成熟了。工作组亲手执笔，让群众进行卖棉登记。这时才发现连村干部思想也没搞通。中共支部书记张文光和民兵指导员张炳等在本村合伙开着个花店，因售棉、储棉任务妨碍着个人利益，对售棉储棉工作消极不前。支部委员张书芳和王凤明等四人听说让自报存棉，偷着把七百多斤存棉运到城里储藏起来。群众对售棉储棉更有许多怀疑：多数群众怕露富，有的则怕存到银行领取时手续麻烦，怕卖了棉花买不到东西。因此都观望不前，不报或少报。
    后来工作组检讨出包办代替的工作方法不对头，就把售棉储棉任务完全交给村干部来作。因为对村干部思想发动不够成熟，村干部们既不以自己的模范行为带动群众，也不很好地向群众宣传，只是简单要求群众竞赛售棉，让群众自订保证完成的条件。张大文组在讨论时，棉农就向支部委员张文华质问：“政府号召卖棉，为什么你有三百斤存棉不报？我们全组向你挑战！”张文华反说：“我有棉花还留着穿呢！”张金明组在组织群众讨论时，村干部张书训提出：“如果有存棉不卖怎么处理？”让每个人表示态度。有的说：“限三天把花卖完，过后查出有存棉不卖，没收归公。”还有的说：“查出来戴高帽子游街。”有的组还让群众立字画押。发生这种情况后，工作组有的干部却认为这是“群众自发挑战”，不算“强迫”，这样做的结果，因为群众思想顾虑并没有解除，有很多棉农不敢公开卖棉。有些棉农虽然挑战订了条件，可是并没有把棉花拿出来。
                （米荣运）
    编者按：从河北成安林里堡购棉储棉工作的失败中，我们应该吸取些什么教训，注意些什么问题呢？第一、购棉工作组和其他派赴农村中进行这一工作的干部，必须注意基层党员干部和农民群众中存在着那些具体的思想问题，针对这些思想问题进行深入的宣传教育，切实予以解决，并以充分的物资供应打破棉农怕卖了棉花买不到东西的顾虑，而不能停止于一般道理和一般政策的宣传。尤其需要切实打通党员、干部的思想，经过他们去对广大农民进行宣传，并以他们自己的模范行为带动群众。工作组和上级干部的包办代替或放弃领导，都会招致工作的失败。
    第二、对于不能响应政府和党的号召，不能起模范作用，只知道对群众实行强迫命令的党员，必须进行严格的批评、教育，使他们迅速纠正错误，恢复党在群众中的威信，使工作能顺利进行。对于不肯纠正错误，不能以个人利益服从党与人民利益的党员，应该按照党章的规定予以纪律制裁。
