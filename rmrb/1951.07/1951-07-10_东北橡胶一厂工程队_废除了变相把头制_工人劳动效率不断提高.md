　　Northeast Rubber Factory No. 1 Engineering Team
    Abolishing Disguised Foreman System
    Workers' Labor Efficiency Continuously Improves
    After abolishing the disguised feudal foreman system – the “small contracting” system – the engineering team of Northeast Light Industry Bureau's Rubber Factory No. 1 has unleashed the workers’ production enthusiasm.

    Since February of this year, the engineering team of Rubber Factory No. 1 has recruited many workers from various locations. They formed small groups of three to five people. Each small group had a so-called "worker representative" (a disguised foreman; the same applies below) who did not participate in actual labor. When signing small contracting agreements, they bargained and haggled, and falsely reported the number of workers. During construction, they only sought speed, resulting in substandard quality of dormitory repair projects, and they casually burned leftover wood for heating. When distributing wages, most of the time they did not allocate based on the workers' technical level and nature of work, but rather adopted an egalitarian distribution method. Some "representatives" even deceived workers and exploited their wages.

    In early April, the Basic Construction Department of the Northeast Light Industry Bureau decided to abolish the "small contracting" system, reorganize all seasonal workers into registered workers directly led by the engineering team, and implement piece-rate wages. Based on this decision, after discussion at a cadre meeting, a general meeting of all seasonal workers was convened to expose the exploitation of the foremen and announce the abolition of the representative system (actually the foreman system). Those former worker representatives with skills and abilities were to participate in actual labor; those who could do other work were assigned other work; and those who could not participate in work were given travel expenses to return home. At the meeting, the new wage system, based on the principle of more work, more pay and piece-rate wages, was explained to everyone. After repeated ideological education, the workers unanimously supported the new system and democratically elected their own foremen.

    After the organizational rectification, short-term training classes were held to improve the political and professional level of the newly elected foremen. The training focused mainly on political study, while also studying some professional aspects, such as foremen responsibilities, on-site technical guidance, construction management, learning advanced experience, and rationally organizing the labor force. After studying, everyone made great progress and conscientiously went into the masses and relied on the masses, responsible for technical inspection and command work; there were also improvements in the use of materials and allocation of labor. In addition, supervisory and security systems were established, and engineering quality inspections were strictly implemented, which played a significant role in ensuring project quality and improving production efficiency.

    The workers felt very satisfied with the new system. After the new wage system was implemented at the end of April, the workers unleashed their enthusiasm. Workers specializing in doors and windows continuously improved their labor efficiency, exceeded the required quality standards, and reduced the material consumption quota. They voluntarily proposed competitions to ensure that the percentage of qualified products reached 100%, not wasting a single nail or piece of wood, and completing tasks ahead of schedule.

### 东北橡胶一厂工程队  废除了变相把头制  工人劳动效率不断提高

　　东北橡胶一厂工程队
    废除了变相把头制
    工人劳动效率不断提高
    东北轻工业管理局橡胶一厂工程队废除了变相的封建把头制——“小包工”制后，发挥了工人的生产积极性。
    自今年二月份以来，橡胶一厂工程队陆续由各地招来很多工人。他们都是三、五个人一伙，结成一个小团体。每一小团体有一名所谓“工人代表”（变相的把头，下同），不参加实际劳动。对外订立小包工合同时，讨价还价，虚报人数。在施工中只图快，使补修宿舍工程质量不合标准，并随便将剩余的木材烧掉取暖。分配工资时，大部分不按工人技术水准和工作性质来分配，而是采用平均主义的分配办法。有的“代表”甚至欺骗工人，剥削工人工资。
    四月上旬，东北轻工业管理局基本建设处决定，取消“小包工”制，将全体季节性工人改编为工程队直接领导的在籍工人，实行计件工资。根据这一决定，经干部会议讨论后，召开了季节性工人全体大会，向大家揭露了把头的剥削行为，宣布取消代表制（实际上是把头制），让原先工人代表中有技术有能力的参加实际劳动，能做其他工作的分配其他工作，不能参加工作的发给回家路费。会上并向大家解释了今后的新工资制度是根据多劳多得的原则实行计件工资。经过反复思想教育后，工人一致拥护新制度，民主选出了自己的工长。
    整顿组织后，为了提高新选出工长的政治和业务水平，开办了短期训练班。以学习政治为主，同时研究一些业务，如工长责任、现场技术指导、施工管理、学习先进经验、合理组织劳动力等。大家经过学习后有了很大进步，都认真地深入群众和依靠群众，负责技术检查和指挥工作；在使用材料和配备劳动力方面也都有了改进。此外，还建立了监工、保安等制度，严格地执行了工程质量检查，对保证工程质量及提高生产效率起了很大作用。
    工人们对新制度感觉很满意。四月末开始实行新工资制度后，工人发挥了积极性。专做门窗的工人，劳动效率不断提高，超过了要求的质量标准，并降低了材料消耗定额。他们自动提出竞赛，保证合格品达到百分之百，不浪费一钉一木，提前完成任务。        （工）
