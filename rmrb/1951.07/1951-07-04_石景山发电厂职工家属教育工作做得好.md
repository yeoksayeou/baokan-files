The Shijingshan Power Plant has paid attention to strengthening the propaganda and education work for the families of its employees during the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. This has allowed more than 1,800 family members (excluding young children) to receive patriotic education on Resist America, Aid Korea, improving their understanding and making them realize that Resist America, Aid Korea is to protect their good lives. As a result, their enthusiasm for participating in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement has been greatly enhanced. They have all participated in the signature voting to support the Five Great Powers concluding a peace pact and oppose the United States arming Japan, and have generally established patriotic covenants. When establishing the patriotic covenants, under the slogan of "doing a good job in housework and assisting employees in doing a good job in production," they made guarantees to all employees of the plant and to their husbands: "If you complete 0.7 (referring to reducing coal consumption), we will work hard to study current events," "Wash clothes every three days, don't eat the same meal for seven days, you don't need to fetch water from the tank, and we won't let the children disturb you when you want to sleep." They also guaranteed that their husbands would not ask for leave or miss work due to housework. Recently, they actively responded to the call of the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association and enthusiastically donated weapons. Many family members donated their gold rings. When donating their gold rings, Zhu Shurong and Guo Meilin wrote to the union saying, "For the happiness of the children of China and Korea, I have taken out this beloved item."

Due to the increased political awareness of the employees' families, they have changed their old habits and actively participated in various social activities and labor production. Currently, 380 family members participate in the employees' spare-time cultural school, accounting for more than 38% of the young and middle-aged family members; about 80 people participate in the reading group. After studying, their cultural level has rapidly improved. Currently, there are 10 people in the middle school class and 40 people in the senior primary school class. Organizations such as the waist drum team, singing team, and theater troupe among the family members have also been established. In addition, under the leadership of the union's family committee, they have established a laundry department, sewing group, and reclamation group to engage in labor production. They also actively participate in public welfare activities such as removing garbage and digging ditches. The old habits of family members who were unwilling to work, unwilling to study, greedy for enjoyment, and quarreling and fighting in the past have now undergone fundamental changes. Dr. Jiang from the clinic said, "There hasn't been a single case of illness due to family disputes and fights recently."

The Shijingshan Power Plant's family education work has been successful and achieved great results, mainly due to the following reasons:

　　1. The Party organization and the trade union of the plant attached importance to the work of the families of the employees, regarding the publicity and education of the families of the employees as an important part of the entire publicity work within the plant. The trade union has set up a family committee to be responsible for leading the work of the families of the employees, and has a cadre who has left production to be specifically responsible for this work. During the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the Party and the trade union organized a great propaganda force to work with the families.

　　2. Attention has been paid to cultivating activists among family members, selecting them as cadres and propagandists for family work, and relying on them to carry out family work. The plant has cultivated 54 backbones from the family reading group and allowed them to listen to the reports and then go to different areas to spread the word. When popularizing the education of Resist America, Aid Korea, active members from the families were absorbed to form 29 door-to-door propaganda groups to carry out propaganda from door to door. Zong Zhimin, a family member, held her child and publicized to more than a dozen families in one day, demonstrating a high degree of enthusiasm. In the past, there were already two Party propagandists in the families, and currently there are two more who are about to be formally approved by the Party as propagandists. A very important reason why the work of the employees' families in the plant can be done well is thanks to the help of these family activists. It is impossible to do a good job in publicizing the families by relying only on a few working cadres from above.

　　3. Carrying out propaganda and education work for family members of employees based on the characteristics of their lives. Generally speaking, propaganda methods such as kang-head propaganda, door-to-door propaganda, street propaganda, informal talks, accusations, and storytelling are more suitable for the families of employees. This kind of "delivered to the door" propaganda solves the difficulties of family members who have many children and old men and women who do not often go out and cannot receive education. In addition, it is also easy to achieve results through propaganda by family activists, because this makes it easier to grasp the ideological situation and can suit the tastes of the family members. Cartoons, dramas, movies, broadcasts, reading newspapers, etc. have also played a great role in carrying out propaganda and education for family members, and these propaganda forms are loved by the families of employees.

　　4. Pay attention to absorbing family members to participate in various practical tasks, such as cooperatives, libraries, broadcasting stations, health work, etc., and improve family members' working abilities through practical activities. This point is also very important. Some family members of employees said: "Do it yourself, think of ways yourself, and slowly overcome the shortcomings of 'being at a loss when encountering something'."

　　5. Appropriately solve the difficulty of family members taking care of children. On average, each young and middle-aged family member has two young children. Without solving the problem of taking care of children, family members cannot participate in various activities. In order to solve this problem, the plant organized temporary nurseries to take care of the children. In addition, there are temporary mutual assistance methods to allow mothers to help each other take care of children, so that mothers are not held back by young children.

　　石景山发电厂职工家属教育工作做得好
    魏光
    石景山发电厂在抗美援朝运动中，注意加强了对职工家属的宣传教育工作，使一千八百多职工家属（幼童除外）都受到了抗美援朝的爱国教育，提高了她们的认识，使她们都懂得了抗美援朝就是为了保卫自己的好日子，因而大大提高了她们参加抗美援朝运动的积极性。她们全体已参加了拥护五大国缔结和平公约和反对美国武装日本的签名投票，并已普遍地订立了爱国公约。在订立爱国公约时，她们在“搞好家务，协助职工搞好生产”的口号下，向全厂职工，向自己的丈夫提出了保证：“你们完成○·七（指降低煤耗而言），我们努力学时事”“三天衣服洗一遍，七天不吃重样饭，缸里没水不用你挑，你要睡觉不叫孩子吵。”并保证不让自己的丈夫因家务而请假误工。最近她们又积极响应抗美援朝总会号召，热烈捐献武器，不少家属献出了自己的金戒指。朱树荣、郭梅林在捐献自己的金戒指时，写信给工会说：“为了中朝孩子们的幸福，我拿出了这心爱的东西。”
    职工家属由于政治觉悟的提高，已改变了过去的旧习惯，积极地参加了各种社会活动，参加了劳动生产。目前家属参加职工业余文化学校者即达三百八十人，占青壮年家属百分之三十八以上；参加读报组者八十人左右。经过学习以后，她们的文化程度迅速提高，现在上中学班的十人，上高小班的四十人。家属中的腰鼓队、歌咏队、剧团等组织也都成立了起来。此外，她们并在工会家属委员会的领导下，成立了洗衣部、缝纫组和开荒组，从事劳动生产。她们对清除垃圾，挖水沟等公益活动，也都积极参加。过去家属中不愿劳动、不愿学习、贪图享受、吵嘴打架的旧习气，现在已有了根本的改变。医务室姜大夫说：“因为闹家务打架得病的，最近一个也没有了。”
    石景山发电厂职工家属教育工作，所以能做得好，收到很大成绩，其主要原因有以下几点：
    一、是由于该厂党的组织和工会重视了职工家属工作，把对职工家属的宣传教育工作，看成是厂内整个宣传工作的一个重要部分。工会成立了家属委员会，专门负责领导对职工家属的工作，并有一位脱离生产的干部专门负责此项工作。在抗美援朝运动中，党和工会曾组织了很大宣传力量去对家属进行工作。
    二、注意培养了家属中的积极分子，选拔她们为家属工作的干部和宣传员，依靠她们去进行家属工作。该厂从家属读报组中，培养了五十四名骨干，让她们听了报后，再去分片宣传。普及抗美援朝教育时，吸收家属中的积极分子组成了二十九个串门宣传小组，挨门进行宣传。家属宗志敏抱了孩子，一天就宣传了十几家，发挥了高度的积极性。过去家属中已有两个党的宣传员，目前还有两个即将被党正式批准为宣传员。该厂职工家属工作能做得好，很重要的一个原因，就是得力于这些家属积极分子的帮助。仅靠上面少数的工作干部，要做好家属的宣传工作是不可能的。
    三、根据职工家属生活的特点，去对家属进行宣传教育工作。一般说，炕头宣传、串门宣传、街头宣传、漫谈、控诉、说唱等宣传方式，是比较适合于职工家属的。这种“送上门去”的宣传，就解决了家属中因孩子多和老头、老太太们不常出门得不到教育的困难。另外，通过家属积极分子去宣传，也易于收效，因为这样就容易掌握思想情况，并能合乎家属的口味。漫画、戏剧、电影、广播、读报等在对家属进行宣传教育中，也起了很大的作用，这些宣传形式，都是职工家属所爱好的。
    四、注意吸收家属参加各种实际工作，如合作社、图书馆、广播台、卫生工作等，从实际活动中提高家属的工作能力。这点也是很重要的。有的职工家属说：“自己动手，自己想办法，慢慢就克服了‘遇事没辙’的缺点了。”
    五、要适当解决家属看孩子的困难。每个青壮年家属平均起来都有两个小孩子，不解决看孩子问题，家属就无法参加各种活动。该厂为了解决这一问题，曾组织了临时托儿所去照管孩子。此外并有临时互助的办法，让母亲们自己相互帮助看孩子，这样母亲们就不致被小孩子拖住腿了。
