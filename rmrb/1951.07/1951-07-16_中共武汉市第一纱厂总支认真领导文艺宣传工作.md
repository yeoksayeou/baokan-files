　　The Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill has achieved great results by using folk art forms for propaganda and mobilization. The folk art forms they use include clapper talk, doggerel, flower drum tunes, "Twelfth Month" tunes, hoe song tunes, lotus boat tunes, etc. In the past three months, more than 120 pieces of work have been printed and widely circulated. In February of this year, during the patriotic labor emulation drive, when the Zhou Jiyin group of the Maintenance Department challenged the Jiang Chenqun group, they first used doggerel to write the challenge letter: "To modify the single-roller spinning frame, first install four units by the end of March, without adding night shifts or rework, first install the leaf version, establish a good master-apprentice relationship, after installing one unit, conduct a review, criticize each other and learn from each other, combine theory with practice." After receiving the challenge, the Jiang Chenqun group immediately wrote a response letter in doggerel as well. This kind of competition plan written in literary and artistic form is easy for workers to remember, and thus greatly promoted the development of the competition movement. After discovering this form of propaganda, the general branch of the Chinese Communist Party in the factory made efforts to promote it. For example, in the early stage of the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, they used this form to spread news and solicit workers' opinions on the handling of special agents and local bullies. This method promoted the rapid development of the movement. When Zhou Xisong, the former chairman of the pseudo-trade union, KMT secret agent, and major local bully of the factory, was arrested, the factory leadership immediately compiled a clapper talk to solicit opinions and printed it as a quick report. The quick report quickly spread throughout the factory and among the residents near the factory. A movement to accuse Zhou Sanmao quickly unfolded in the workshop.
　　Later, in the implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations, the promotion of the Patriotic Pact, and the donation of airplanes and artillery, this form of propaganda, which was popular among the workers, played a great role.
　　The general branch of the Chinese Communist Party in the factory earnestly led this very effective propaganda work. After discovering the role of this propaganda form, the general branch of the Chinese Communist Party first set about reorganizing the original literary and artistic group, absorbing activists from the literary and artistic activities of various workshops to participate, expanding the literary and artistic group from the original nine members to twenty-eight. They also led them to change from writing large dramas and novels to writing works in various folk art forms familiar to the workers. This literary and artistic group, together with 120 propagandists, became the backbone of literary and artistic propaganda and mobilization work. Good works were broadcast to all the workers in the factory through the factory's radio station, and printed as quick reports to be distributed to the workers. The propagandists then performed and sang to the workers based on the quick reports. When a work task arrived, a movement began to unfold, or work had new developments, the propaganda committee member of the general branch of the Chinese Communist Party would discuss with the literary and artistic group and the propagandists how to carry out propaganda and mobilization, and how to help the workers in the workshop to write. The members of the literary and artistic group and the propagandists mostly wrote collectively with the workers in the workshop. Now, whenever something happens in the workshop, the workers urge those who can write to write it out quickly. Under the leadership of the general branch of the Chinese Communist Party, this propaganda and mobilization work using folk art forms has formed a mass activity in the factory.

### 中共武汉市第一纱厂总支认真领导文艺宣传工作

　　中共武汉市第一纱厂总支认真领导文艺宣传工作
    武汉市第一纱厂用民间文艺形式进行宣传鼓动，收效很大。他们所用民间文艺形式包括快板、顺口溜、花鼓调、十二月调、锄头歌调、采莲船调等等，三个多月以来，经印发流传较广的作品就有一百二十多件。在今年二月，爱国主义劳动竞赛中，该厂保全部周基银小组向蒋成群小组挑战时，就首先用顺口溜写成挑战书：“改装单滚筒细纱机，先装四台在三月底，不加夜班不返工，先把叶子版安装起，师徒关系建立好，一台装后开检讨，互相批评互相学，理论实际相结合。”蒋成群小组接到后，马上也用顺口溜写了应战书。这样用文艺形式写成的竞赛计划，很便于工人们记忆，因之大大推动了竞赛运动的开展。该厂中共总支发现这一宣传形式后，便努力加以推广。例如在镇压反革命运动的初期，就运用这种形式传播消息，征求职工们对处理特务分子和恶霸分子的意见，这个办法推动运动很快展开。当该厂伪工会理事长、中统特务、大恶霸周西松被捕时，该厂领导方面立即编出征求意见的快板，印成快报。快报迅速传遍全厂和厂外附近的居民中。车间里很快就展开了控诉周三毛的运动。
    后来，在实施劳动保险条例、推行爱国公约和捐献飞机大炮等运动中，这种为工人喜闻乐见的宣传形式都发挥了很大的作用。
    该厂中共总支认真地领导了这种收效很大的宣传工作。中共总支在发现这种宣传形式的作用后，首先就着手改组原来的文艺组，吸收各车间工人文艺活动中的积极分子参加，使文艺组由原来的九人扩大到二十八人。并领导他们由写大剧本、小说改为写工人熟悉的各种民间文艺形式的作品。这个文艺组加上一百二十个宣传员，就成为文艺宣传鼓动工作的骨干力量。好的作品通过本厂广播台向全厂工人广播，并印成快报发给工人。宣传员就根据快报向工人说唱。当一个工作任务到来，一个运动开始展开或工作有了新的发展的时候，中共总支宣传委员就和文艺组、宣传员研究如何进行宣传鼓动，如何帮助车间工人写作。文艺组员和宣传员大都和车间工人一块儿集体写作。现在车间一有事情，工人就催促能写的人快写出来。在中共总支的领导下，这种利用民间文艺形式的宣传鼓动工作已在该厂形成群众性的活动。    （新华社）
