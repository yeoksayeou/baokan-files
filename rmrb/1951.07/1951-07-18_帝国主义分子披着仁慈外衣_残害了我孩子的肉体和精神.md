　　Imperialist Elements, Cloaked in Benevolence, Mutilated My Child's Body and Spirit
　  To the Editors:
　　In 1943, driven by poverty, I sent my nine-year-old only daughter to the Ren Ci Tang (Benevolence Hall) run by the French Catholic Church in Xishiku, Beijing, to be fostered. At the time, I thought they were truly "benevolent," and I foolishly signed my name on a pre-printed contract, never realizing that once this "indentured servitude contract" was signed, my child could no longer leave. Children were only allowed to see relatives once or twice a month (limited to the 5th and 6th), and conversations could not exceed one hour. If a child absolutely had to go out, the Ren Ci Tang would send someone to monitor them (in reality, my child was never allowed to go out with me even once). Every time my child saw me, she would ask for pickled vegetables, salt, and other food items. According to my child, they spent half the day "studying" and half the day working. The so-called "study" was reading scriptures; their work before liberation was embroidering tablecloths and doing needlepoint, which were then shipped to France and the United States. The children were busy from morning till night, but they were only fed thin porridge twice a day, morning and evening, and two small, sour, and dark steamed buns for lunch, with not even enough salt. If they fell ill, they would be sent to the sickroom, with no medicine or doctors, and only told to drink boiled water every day. Those with good health could endure for a few days and survive, but those with poor health could only "ascend to heaven." My child lost her mother when she was two years old, and I loved her very much. When I didn't live in the city, I would still come every month to bring her things, which is why she is still alive; but a once very lively child has become dull and lifeless. In 1948, my child once ran away, but she was caught and brought back. After that, my child's life became even worse, and when I went to see her, she didn't even dare to say much to me. After liberation, I became a cook at North China University. My child said to me, "Dad, you've become a Communist, don't worry about me anymore. We can't be together in life, and we can't be together in death either. Because when I die, I will ascend to heaven, and when you die, you will go to hell." I asked her if she knew about Chairman Mao, and she said, "Isn't it just 'The East is Red, the sun rises'?" Now, whenever I think of my child, I feel extremely sad. I bitterly hate the imperialist elements who use the cloak of religion and charity to mutilate the bodies and spirits of Chinese children. I believe that one day, we will drive these wolves in sheep's clothing out of China.

　　帝国主义分子披着仁慈外衣
　  残害了我孩子的肉体和精神编辑同志：
    一九四三年，我为生活所迫，将我九岁的独生女儿送到北京西什库法国天主教所办的仁慈堂去寄养。当时我以为他们真是“仁慈”的，并且糊里糊涂在他们印好的契约上写上了我的名字，谁知这个“卖身契约”一写下之后，孩子就不能再出来了。孩子被规定每月只能接见亲人一至二次（限五、六号），说话不能超过一点钟。如果孩子一定要出来的话，仁慈堂就要派一个人跟着监视（实际上我的孩子并没有被允许跟我出来过一次）。我的孩子每次见着我的时候，总是要咸菜和盐以及其他吃的东西。据孩子说：她们在里边是半天“学习”，半天作工。所谓“学习”就是读经；她们的工作在解放前是绣台布，挑花，做成就运往法国、美国。孩子们一天忙到晚，但是吃的却是早晚两顿稀粥，中午两个又酸又黑的小馒头，而且连盐都不够。要是生了病，那就往病房一送，没有药也没有医生，每天只叫喝些开水。身体好的忍受几天可以度过，身体不好的只有“升入天堂”。我这孩子由两岁上就没有了母亲，我很爱她，当我没有在本市住着的时候，我每月也要来给她送点东西，所以她还在活着；可是一个很活泼的孩子，已痴呆的不成样子了。在一九四八年我的孩子曾偷跑出来一次，后来又被捉回去了。从此以后，我的孩子的生活就更糟糕了，我再去的时候，孩子见了我连话都不敢多说。解放后我到华北大学当炊事员，孩子对我说：“爸爸，你当了共产党啦，你不要再挂念我吧，我们生着不能在一起，死了也不能在一起了。因为我死了要升天堂，你死了要入地狱的。”我问她知道毛主席不知道？她说：“还不是东方红太阳升。”现在我一想起我的孩子，心里就非常难过。我对帝国主义分子披着宗教和慈善的外衣，来残害中国儿童的肉体和精神的事万分痛恨，我想终有一天，我们会把这些披着羊皮的狼赶出中国去的。
