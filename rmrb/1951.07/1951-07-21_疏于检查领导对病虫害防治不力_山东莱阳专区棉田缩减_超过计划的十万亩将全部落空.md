　　Negligence in Inspection and Ineffective Leadership in Pest and Disease Control
　  Cotton Fields in Laiyang Prefecture, Shandong, Shrink
　  Exceeding Planned Acreage by 100,000 Mu, All Efforts to be in Vain
    A phenomenon of shrinking cotton field area has occurred in the cotton-growing areas of Laiyang Prefecture, Shandong. The reasons for this serious phenomenon are the cotton seedling blight and the poor germination rate of cotton seeds. The lack of seedlings is very serious in some areas. At present, cotton aphids have become widespread throughout the region. Some cotton farmers have low confidence in cotton planting. Leading cadres are only satisfied with the cotton planting area and neglect inspection and leadership, resulting in farmers switching to other crops in large numbers. Looking at the entire Laiyang Prefecture, although the sown area exceeded the original plan by nearly 100,000 mu, the cotton field area has been greatly reduced due to the damage from seedling blight, lack of seedlings, crop changes, and cotton aphids. It is estimated that only the originally planned 230,000 mu can be completed, and the excess of 100,000 mu will all be in vain.
    The serious situation of cotton field reduction in Laiyang Prefecture has affected the completion of this year's cotton production increase task. At present, leaders in some areas have begun to pay attention to this problem and are organizing the masses to transplant seedlings and control pests. However, the following problems still exist in the leadership of most areas:
    (1) Insufficient understanding of pest and disease prevention and control, inability to grasp the timing and patterns of pest and disease occurrence, resulting in a passive response after pest and disease outbreaks; In some areas (especially areas with no cotton planting habits), because the working cadres did not conduct sufficient mobilization and education work for cotton farmers at the beginning of cotton planting, and failed to continue education and inspection afterwards, the concerns of some people about cotton planting have not been eradicated, and they hold the view of perfunctorily responding to higher authorities.
    (2) Although there are many methods for preventing and controlling cotton pests and diseases and transplanting seedlings, they have not been accepted by the majority of cotton farmers. Most cotton farmers (except in areas with pest control and seedling transplantation habits) still lack confidence in pest control and seedling transplantation; Most cadres hold the simple view of asking for methods from higher authorities and cannot personally conduct experiments or educate the masses by setting examples through the masses.
    The phenomena of missing seedlings and crop changes and the damage caused by cotton aphids will not only affect the completion of this year's cotton production increase task but will also affect the increase in cotton planting next year. Therefore, leading cadres at all levels must attach great importance to this issue, earnestly lead cotton farmers to actively transplant seedlings, eliminate pests, and prune cotton to protect the growth of cotton seedlings to ensure increased cotton production.

　　疏于检查领导对病虫害防治不力
　  山东莱阳专区棉田缩减
　  超过计划的十万亩将全部落空
    山东莱阳专区棉区发生棉田面积缩小现象。造成这种严重现象的原因，是由于棉花立枯病和棉种发芽率较差，部分地区缺苗现象甚严重，目前全区又较普遍地发生了棉蚜，部分棉农对植棉信心不高，而领导干部又只满足于棉花播种面积，疏于检查及领导，以致农民大量改种其他作物。就莱阳专区全区来看，虽播种时已超过原计划近十万亩，但经立枯病、缺苗、改种、和棉蚜的损害，棉田面积已大为缩减，估计现仅可完成原订计划二十三万亩，超出的十万亩将全部落空。
    莱阳专区棉田缩减的严重情况，已影响今年棉花增产任务的完成。目前部分地区领导干部已开始重视这一问题，组织群众移苗、治虫，但大部地区领导上尚存在着以下问题：
    （一）对病虫害的防除认识不足，不能掌握病虫害发生的时间和规律，因而病虫害发生后即显得被动应付；部分地区（特别是无种棉习惯的地区）因开始植棉时工作干部对棉农未进行充分地动员教育工作，事后又未能继续教育、检查，因而部分群众对植棉的顾虑未能根除，有应付上级的观点。
    （二）防除棉花病虫害、移苗等办法虽很多，但未被广大棉农所接受，大部分棉农（除有治虫、移苗习惯的地区外）对治虫、移苗仍然缺乏信心；大部分干部又抱着单纯向上级要办法的观点，不能将已有办法亲作试验或通过群众作出样子教育群众。
    缺苗、改种现象与棉蚜为害，不仅影响今年棉花增产任务的完成，且将影响到明年增种棉花。因此，各地领导干部必须高度重视这一问题，认真领导棉农积极移苗、除虫、修棉，保护棉苗成长，以保证棉花增产。
