　　Who is the Creator of History?
    ——A Visit to the "Chinese Primitive Society Exhibition Room"
    Chen Weiren
    The "Chinese Primitive Society Exhibition Room" of the National Beijing History Museum is a miniature of Chinese primitive society. For those who study Chinese history and learn "The History of Social Development," it is undoubtedly a clearly annotated reference book. It can tell you how labor created the world, how apes became humans, thereby allowing you to recognize who are the true creators and masters of history.
    The exhibition room has a total of forty-two display cases. In addition to displaying unearthed objects related to various periods, the room also systematically uses models, diorama boxes, oil paintings, and charts to aid in explanation.
  I. The Discovery of "Peking Man"
    The entire content of the exhibition room includes a long period from the emergence of humans to the dissolution of primitive communal society and the emergence of class society, which is the Neolithic Age and the Paleolithic Age in Chinese history. The exhibition room begins by showing us the general process of human evolution; among which, the most striking is "Peking Man." "Peking Man" was discovered at Zhoukoudian, Fangshan County, Hebei Province. His era was at the beginning of the Quaternary Period of geology, about 500,000 years ago. This type of hominid is representative of the first stage of ape evolution into humans, a type of human that still possessed ape-like characteristics.
    Obviously, the discovery of "Peking Man" is a significant contribution not only in China but also in the history of academic culture worldwide. First, the various characteristics of the "Peking Man" skull prove that this type of hominid evolved from "ancient apes." Second, because this type of hominid knew how to make tools, archaeologists judged that this was the first "human" to appear on the Chinese mainland, the first "human" to be separated from animals. More importantly, the emergence of "Peking Man" not only further proves that "from ape to human" is an irrefutable truth, but also eloquently refutes myths such as the so-called "Pangu" being born simultaneously with heaven and earth and "Nüwa" creating humans from yellow earth in the study of the origin of the Chinese race; in addition, it also proves the theory of the great revolutionary teacher Engels that "labor created man" and the developing doctrine of Marxism-Leninism.
    As to whether "Peking Man" is the true ancestor of modern Chinese people, it remains to be further verified. Because until now, the "intermediate human types" between "Peking Man" and modern Chinese people, besides the "Ordos Man" (about 200,000 to 300,000 years ago) and the "Upper Cave Man" (100,000 years ago), of whom only one incisor has been discovered so far, there are no more systematic discoveries. However, one thing is certain, that the discovery of "Peking Man" proves that on the land of our great motherland, as early as five million years ago, there were already human activities and labor creations, which represent the early culture of the Chinese Paleolithic Age.

  II. The Kindred of "Ordos Man"
    The exhibition room also provides a detailed explanation of Paleolithic culture. This era is the obscure era in Chinese history. The primitive groups of the early obscure era, because they had just left forest life, their physical form had not completely transformed from "arboreal type" to "terrestrial type," and their arms and toes were still very long, with not very significant differences from "hominoids." But since coming to the ground, they began to straighten their bodies, that is, they began to labor with their thick hands, making tools, and gradually changing their hands in labor, making their hands more flexible, and at the same time, in order to make their hands labor more freely, the hind limbs took on the role of supporting the whole body, and the body straightened up. In this way, the curtain of human history was opened. However, the tools at this time were still only crude stones and wooden sticks, and they could not effectively conquer ferocious beasts.
    However, in order to obtain all the means of livelihood from nature, these primitive groups, under the conditions of common labor and common enjoyment, once fought against all the difficulties of nature with unparalleled courage and wisdom, gradually improving the technology of making fighting and production tools, and knowing how to use fire, pushing Chinese history forward to the middle of the obscure era.
    The middle of the obscure era is also the middle of the Paleolithic Age. The primitive group of this period is the "Ordos Man," of whom only one incisor has been discovered so far. From the display case, we can already see that the stone tools used by "Ordos Man" were relatively advanced, with skinning tools and pointed tools. This shows that humans at that time could carry out hunting more effectively and had a large amount of meat food.
    Among the primitive groups, the application of "fire" is most worthy of special mention. Because the application of "fire" changed the face of ancient human history. From the display case, we can see that with stone tools, bone tools, and "fire," primitive groups have become the masters of nature. At this time, they could not only "cook raw food," which fundamentally changed human life; but also use fire to drive away wild beasts. At this time, the economic life of primitive groups no longer completely relied on collecting; they also launched large-scale hunting activities to obtain means of livelihood. The forests and wildernesses that were originally rampant with wild beasts were now filled with the victorious voices of hunters, and the silence of the primordial world was gone forever.

  III. The Culture of "Upper Cave Man"
    By the time of the so-called post-glacial period in geology, Chinese history had entered the upper stage of the obscure era, which is also the upper stage of the Paleolithic Age. The production tools of this period were undoubtedly more improved. The culture of the "Upper Cave Man" in Zhoukoudian is an important discovery representing the historical traces of this period.
    In the culture of the "Upper Cave Man," what best illustrates the high wisdom of humans at that time is the appearance of the "perforated bone needle." This type of perforated bone needle proves that humans at that time already knew how to sew leather. We can also clearly see this fact from the display case: many disheveled primitive groups were no longer naked, but were wearing aprons made of various animal skins, and a large number of drilled animal teeth and other bone tools were also used as ornaments. The production tools not only shrank in size, but also generally tended to be uniform in shape. This proves that the primitive groups at that time were already able to control stone materials in a planned way. After this, humans developed forward and entered the period of Neolithic culture, which is also the barbaric era in Chinese history.

  IV. The Appearance of Pottery and Polished Stone Tools
    There are a total of twenty-five display cases related to Neolithic culture in the exhibition room. The way of life of humans during this period was also common labor and common enjoyment. However, due to the progress of production tools and the development of productivity, the social and economic organization of humans also changed. In particular, the marriage system had evolved from promiscuity, group marriage, and endogamy in the obscure era to exogamy in the late Neolithic Age, and had progressed to pairing marriage.
    The life of humans during this period was more stable and there were specialized handicrafts. It is said that in the later period there was also relatively constant trade. In terms of production tools, the beginning of the Neolithic culture is mainly characterized by the appearance of pottery and polished stone tools. People had pottery, which solved the difficulties in storing water and cooking food in life; with stone axes and stone knives, they could cut down trees to build houses. As a result of long-term large-scale hunting and gathering activities, people gradually learned to domesticate livestock and plant crops. In addition, large-scale fishing also appeared during this period. There was also a gradual division of labor between men and women. Women mostly engaged in making pottery and weaving. Men mostly engaged in farming, hunting, fishing, and combat, and thus controlled economic power, so that the social organization had to change from the previous female-centered to male-centered. People began to live a life of "men tilling and women weaving," and agriculture occupied a major position in people's economic life.
    In addition, in the display case of this period, the introduction of "pottery" is particularly worth mentioning. The pottery at that time can be roughly divided into two major systems: "painted pottery and black pottery." The invention of pottery greatly improved people's lives and solved the difficulties of storing water and cooking food. Like the invention and improvement of other production tools, the invention of pottery also demonstrated the high wisdom of mankind. This wisdom was also created by labor, and it is the accumulation of the production experience and knowledge of predecessors. In particular, the "painted pottery culture" is exquisitely made and the painting art is extremely subtle. This fully demonstrates that after humans have division of labor and the development of productivity, they naturally tend to create art.

  V. Bronze Ware and the Dissolution of Primitive Communes
    The exhibits finally illustrate the invention of bronze ware, the frequency of wars, and the emergence of class society. This was already the upper stage of barbarism. The creation of humans in history and culture during this period was already quite brilliant. Not only has the technology of making war and production tools been improved as never before, but also the invention of hand mills, vehicles, textiles, and the manufacture of oil and wine, and they already know how to make metal tools, and even know how to use levers and pulleys to transport large stones, build tomb bases and build houses.
    Obviously, the discovery of copper promoted the dissolution of the primitive commune system. Due to the improvement of production tools and the improvement of productivity, people's production had a surplus, thus making exploitation possible; in addition, wars were frequent, and some powerful military chiefs became dictators, and the system of publicly elected chiefs in the past was naturally abolished. This is the so-called transformation from "public ownership of the world" to "family ownership of the world." According to the speculation of archaeologists and historians, agricultural production at that time also changed from cultivation anywhere to rotating cultivation on a fixed piece of land, and the ownership of farmland also changed from public ownership and distribution to hereditary and private ownership due to the collapse of the clan system towards the disintegration of large families and the differentiation of large families. Animal husbandry, hunting, and fishing also tended to be individualized due to the development of productivity and the division and occupation of land. Private property gradually appeared under such circumstances. In particular, prisoners of war also became private property at this time, and instead of being killed, they were forced by the rulers to engage in productive labor for them. This prepared important material conditions for the slave society; and "slaves" were actually the foundation of the brilliant and splendid historical culture of mankind thereafter. From then on, humans on the Chinese mainland crossed the threshold of class society, and the classes were no longer "sharing hunger and cold," and the driving force for the progress of history was not anything else but cruel class struggle.
    Who is the master of history? Who created the world and changed the world? History has already answered this question for us.

　　谁是历史的创造者？
    ——“中国原始社会陈列室”参观记
    陈维仁
    国立北京历史博物馆的“中国原始社会陈列室”，是一幅中国原始社会的缩影。它对于研究中国历史与学习《社会发展史》的人，无异是一部注解明析的参考书。它可以告诉你：劳动怎样创造世界，猿怎样变成人，从而使你认识到谁是真正历史的创造者和主人。
    陈列室共有四十二个陈列柜。室内除陈列着与各个时期有关的出土物外，还系统地用模型、布景箱、油画、图表来帮助说明。
  一、“中国猿人”的发现
    陈列室的全部内容，包括从人类的发生到原始公社制解体、阶级社会出现为止的一段漫长时间，也就是中国历史上的新石器时代与旧石器时代。陈列室开始显示给我们的就是人类进化的大概过程；其中最引人注目的是“中国猿人”。“中国猿人”是在河北房山县周口店发现的。他的时代是在地质学第四纪之初，距今约五十多万年前。这种猿人是猿演变成人的第一个阶段的代表者，是一种尚有猿性质的人类。
    显然，“中国猿人”的发现，不但在中国，在世界学术文化史上，也是一个重大的贡献。首先从“中国猿人”头盖骨的诸种特征，证明了这种猿人是从“古猿”演变而来的。其次，由于这种猿人是知道制造工具的，因此，考古学家判断：这就是中国大陆上最初出现的“人类”，是从动物中划分出来的第一种“人类”。更重要的，“中国猿人”的出现，不但更有力地证明了“从猿到人”是一个颠扑不破的真理，而且雄辩地驳斥了中国人种起源学上所谓“盘古”与天地并生、“女娲”用黄土造人等类的神话；另外，还证明了伟大革命导师恩格斯“劳动创造了人”的理论和马克思列宁主义发展的学说。
    至于“中国猿人”是否就是现代中国人的真正祖先，尚有待于进一步的考证。因为直到现在，从“中国猿人”到现代中国人之间的“中间诸人种型”，除了至今仅发现一个门齿的“河套人”（约二三十万年前）及“山顶洞人”（十万年前）之外，尚无更多有系统的发现。不过，有一点却是可以肯定的，即“中国猿人”的发现，证明了在我们伟大祖国的土地上，远在五千多万年前，就已经有了人类的活动和劳动创造，它代表着中国旧石器时代初期的文化。
  二、“河套人”的类族
    对旧石器文化，陈列室亦作了详细的说明。这个时代即是中国历史上的蒙昧时代。蒙昧时代初期的原始人群，因初离森林生活，其体质形态，还没有完全从“树上型”转化为“地下型”，手臂和脚趾都还很长，与“类人猿”的差别尚不甚显著。但自从下到地面上来之后，他们开始挺直了身躯，即用粗壮的双手，开始劳动，制造工具，并在劳动中逐渐改变着他们的手，使手运用更灵活，同时为使手更自由地劳动，于是后肢担负起来支持全身的作用，身躯挺直起来。这样，就揭开了人类历史的帷幕。不过，这时的工具，还只是些粗糙的石头和木棍，他们还不能有效地征服凶恶的野兽。
    但是，这些原始人群，为了取得自然界的一切生活资料，他们在共同劳动共同享用的条件下，曾经以无比的勇气和智慧，同自然界的一切困难作斗争，逐渐提高了战斗与生产工具的制作技术，并知道了用火，把中国历史向前推进到蒙昧中期。
    蒙昧中期亦即旧石器时代中期，这个时期的原始人群，就是至今仅发现一个门齿的“河套人”，从陈列柜中，我们已经可以看出：“河套人”所用的石器已比较进步，有削皮器，尖头器。这说明当时的人类已可以更有效的进行狩猎，有了大量的肉食。
    在原始人群中，最值得大书特书的是“火”的应用。因为“火”的应用，改变了远古人类历史的面貌。从陈列柜中，我们可以看出：有了石器、骨器和“火”的原始人群，已经成为大自然的主人了。这时，他们不但可以使食物“炮生为熟”，使人类的生活起了根本的变化；而且可以用火来驱逐猛兽。这时原始人群的经济生活，不完全依靠采集生活了，他们还展开大规模的狩猎活动，获取生活资料。原来猛兽横行的森林和原野，这时已充满了猎人们胜利的声音，洪荒世界的沉寂从此一去不复返了。
  三、“山顶洞人”的文化
    到了地质学上所谓后冰河期的时代，中国的历史已经进到蒙昧上期，亦即旧石器时代上期。这一时期生产工具无疑是更加改进了。周口店的“山顶洞人”文化就是代表这个时期史迹的重要发现。
    在“山顶洞人”文化中，最足以说明当时人类高度智慧的，就是“有孔的骨针”的出现。这种有孔骨针，证明了当时的人类，已经知道缝制皮革。这一个事实，我们也可以从陈列柜中，清楚地看到：许多蓬首垢面的原始人群，不再是赤身裸体，而是穿着各种兽皮做成的围裙了，大批钻孔的兽齿等骨器亦被用作装饰品。生产工具不但体形缩小，外形也大体上趋向统一。这就证明当时的原始人群，已经能够有计划地控制石材。此后，人类向前发展进入了新石器文化的时期，亦即中国历史上的野蛮时代。
  四、陶器与磨光石器的出现
    陈列室中有关新石器文化的陈列柜，一共是二十五个。这个时期人类的生活方式亦是共同劳动共同享用。但由于生产工具的进步，生产力的发展，人类的社会经济组织也有所改变，特别是婚姻制度已经从蒙昧时期的杂交、群婚、族内婚演进到族外婚的到新石器时代末期，并已进步到对偶婚姻了。
    这个时期的人类生活已更加安定并有了专门化的手工业，据说后期还有了比较恒常的交易。就生产工具来说，新石器文化的开始，就是以陶器及磨光石器的出现为其主要特征。人们有了陶器，就解决了生活中储水及烹煮食物的困难问题；有了石斧石刀，就可以砍伐林木，用以搭架房屋。长期的大规模的狩猎和采集活动的结果，人们渐渐知道了驯养牲畜和种植植物。此外，大规模的渔捞，亦在这个时期出现。男女之间也逐渐有了分工。女子多从事制陶器、纺织。而男子则多从事耕作、狩猎、捕渔、作战，并因而掌握了经济大权，使社会组织不能不从以前的女性中心变成了男性中心。人们开始过着“男耕女织”的生活，农业遂在人们的经济生活中占据了主要的地位。
    此外，在这个时期的陈列柜中，特别值得提出的是“陶器”介绍。当时的陶器大体上可分“彩陶和黑陶”两个大系统。陶器的发明，使人们的生活得到大大的改善，解决了储水及烹煮食物的困难。正如其他生产工具的发明和改进一样，陶器的发明也表现了人类的高度智慧。这种智慧同样是劳动创造出来的，是前人生产经验和知识的积累。特别是“彩陶文化”，制作精巧，绘画艺术亦极高妙。这充分说明了人类在有了分工及生产力发展之后，便自然而然地趋向于艺术的创造。
  五、铜器与原始公社的解体
    陈列品最后说明了铜器的发明、战争的频仍与阶级社会的产生。这时已是野蛮上期。这个时期的人类，在历史文化上的创造，已经是相当的辉煌了。不但战争与生产工具的制作技术已经空前提高，还发明了手臼、车、纺织、及油酒的制造，并已知道制造金属工具，甚至还知道利用杠杆及滑车搬运大石，修造坟基与建筑房屋。
    很显然，铜的发现促成了原始公社制的解体。由于生产工具的改进，生产力提高了，人们的生产便有了剩余，于是使剥削成为可能；加以战争频仍，有些强有力的军务酋长便成了独裁者，过去公选酋长的制度也自然被废除。这就是所谓“公天下”向“家天下”的转变。据考古学家及历史学家的推断，当时的农业生产也从随地耕种变为固定在一块土地上的轮耕，农田所有权也由于氏族制向着大家族崩溃及大家族的分化而从公有、分配变成世袭和私有。牧畜、狩猎、打渔等亦因生产力发展，土地的分划和占有而趋向个人化。私有财产就在这样的情形下逐渐出现。特别是战争中的俘虏，这时也变成私有财产，不再被杀而是被统治者们强迫着为他们从事生产劳动。这就为奴隶社会准备了重要的物质条件；而“奴隶”实际上就是此后人类光辉灿烂的历史文化的基础。从此，中国大陆上的人类即跨入了阶级社会的门槛，阶级之间再也不是“共饥其饥、共寒其寒”的了，推动历史前进的动力也不是别的而是残酷的阶级斗争。
    谁是历史的主人？谁创造了世界、改变了世界？历史已给我们回答了这个问题。
