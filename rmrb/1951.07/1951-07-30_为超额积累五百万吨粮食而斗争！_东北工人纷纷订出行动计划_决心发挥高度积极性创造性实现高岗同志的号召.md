Strive to Accumulate Five Million Tons of Grain in Excess!
　　Workers in Northeast China Have Successively Drafted Action Plans
　　Determined to Bring into Play a High Degree of Enthusiasm and Creativity to Realize Comrade Gao Gang's Call
The working class in Northeast China has universally and enthusiastically responded to Comrade Gao Gang’s call at the Urban Work Conference convened by the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, determined to unleash the potential of industry and strive to produce and save wealth equivalent to five million tons of grain for the country this year. Industrial bureaus and factories and mines under the Northeast Industrial Department have successively formulated specific action plans for implementation.
    The Mechanical Industry Bureau held a joint meeting of factory directors, general branch secretaries of the CPC, and trade union chairmen of its subordinate factories on July 14. Based on the specific conditions of each factory and after in-depth and thorough discussions, it was decided to further unleash the creativity and enthusiasm of the working masses and launch patriotic labor competitions. The factories under the bureau are to increase production and save 489,000 tons of grain in the second half of this year. The mechanical workers in Northeast China, who have a glorious history in the great cause of building the industrial base of the motherland and first initiated the movement to create new records, have demonstrated their inherent enthusiasm and creative spirit in this great movement. Before the meeting held by the Mechanical Industry Bureau, the workers of the No. 2 Machine Tool Plant had already formulated a plan to respond to Comrade Gao Gang's call to increase production and economize. All employees of the Supply and Marketing Section guaranteed to save 2.8 billion yuan in the second half of the year. Technicians and workers in the Sixth Workshop also proposed: to ensure the reduction of the scrap rate to 2 percent, saving 570 tons of grain. Other departments have also formulated specific plans for increasing production and saving. In total, the plant will produce and save more than 10.229 billion yuan for the country in the second half of the year. The trade union of the No. 3 Machine Tool Plant convened a meeting of labor models and worker representatives, and the representatives present made guarantees on the spot. After the representatives conveyed the message to all the workers in the plant, they also put forward specific plans to guarantee the completion of this glorious task.
    The Light Industry Bureau convened a meeting of factory directors in early July to make arrangements, deciding to start with improving production efficiency, improving quality, and reducing costs. The trade union of the No. 6 Paper Mill convened a general membership meeting. Based on the specific conditions of their plant, they will further reduce costs by 10 to 12 percent on the basis of doing a good job in quality inspection. The capital turnover period will be accelerated from the original 120 days to 80 days, and the production task will be overfulfilled by 12 percent. The workers of Yingkou Paper Mill have already taken action under the call of Comrade Gao Gang. The "papermaking" workshop overcame the past inconsistencies in three-shift operations, improved quality, and increased the weight per square meter from 640 grams to 680 grams. The papermaking width increased from 2.55 meters to 2.7 meters, and they are striving to complete the annual task one month ahead of schedule. Female worker Li Xiuying from the "finishing" workshop previously needed 41 seconds to count one ream of paper (500 sheets). After listening to the general branch secretary of the plant convey Comrade Gao Gang’s call, she realized the importance of the working class's responsibility and further brought into play her enthusiasm, using only 39 seconds to count one ream of paper. She also wants to strive to shorten it to 37 seconds.
    The Fushun Mining Bureau has drafted a specific plan to respond to Comrade Gao Gang's call and accumulate wealth equivalent to five million tons of grain for the country above the planned target. It has decided to make full use of and unleash equipment capacity, strive to exceed production tasks, reduce costs, improve quality, and accelerate capital turnover. In the second half of the year, it will increase production and save 600,000 tons of grain for the country. The Northeast Forestry Industry Bureau wrote a letter to Comrade Gao Gang on "July 1st," guaranteeing to complete and exceed production tasks. In accelerating capital turnover alone, it will save the country 200,000 tons of grain in working capital from July this year to the end of September next year. The workers of Jinzhou Textile Factory, based on the fact that they exceeded the production task by 14.6 percent and reduced costs by 4.76 percent from January to May this year, are further unleashing industrial potential and will increase production and save 150,000 tons of grain for the country by the end of the year. Other important factories and mines are either holding various meetings to formulate specific plans or further mobilizing workers to deliberate and discuss. Workers in all factories are prepared to make more contributions to the motherland in this great movement.
    The working class in Northeast China, which has made glorious contributions to the great cause of restoring and rebuilding Northeast industry and creating an industrial base for the motherland, is now further unleashing its unique enthusiasm and creative spirit on the basis of its existing achievements, to increase production and save wealth equivalent to five million tons of grain for the country above the planned target. The victorious unfolding and success of this movement will play a huge role in the country's industrial construction, national defense construction, and supplying farmers with more industrial products, thereby meeting the needs of farmers and supporting agricultural production.

    东北工人阶级普遍而热烈地响应高岗同志在中共中央东北局召开的城市工作会议上的号召，决心发挥工业的潜在能力，为在今年给国家增产和节约价值五百万吨粮食的财富而斗争。东北工业部所属各工业管理局、各厂矿纷纷订出具体实现的行动计划。
    机械工业管理局在七月十四日举行了所属各厂的厂长、中共总支书记、工会主席的联席会议。根据各厂的具体情况，经过深入而周详的讨论后，决定进一步发挥工人群众的创造性、积极性，展开爱国主义的劳动竞赛，全局所属各厂要在今年下半年增产节约四十八万九千吨粮食。在建设祖国工业基地的伟大事业中有着光辉历史、首先发起创造新纪录运动的东北机械工人，在此伟大的运动中，表现了他们固有的积极性与创造精神。在机械局举行会议之前，机器二厂的职工就已经订出响应高岗同志号召的增产节约计划。供销科全体职工，保证在下半年节省二十八亿元。第六车间的技术人员和工人也提出：保证降低废品率到百分之二，节约五百七十吨粮食。其他各部门都订出增产和节约的具体计划。总计全厂在下半年内，将为国家增产和节约一百零二亿二千九百余万元。机器三厂工会则召开了劳动模范和工人代表会议，到会的代表当场提出保证。全厂工人在听到代表们传达后，也都提出保证完成这一光荣任务的具体计划。
    轻工业管理局七月初召开厂长会议进行布置，决定从提高生产效率、提高质量、降低成本入手。第六造纸厂工会召开了全体会员大会。他们根据本厂的具体情况，要在搞好质量大检查的基础上，再降低成本百分之十到十二。加速资金周转期由原来的一百二十天缩短到八十天，超额百分之十二完成生产任务。营口造纸厂职工已经在高岗同志的号召下行动起来，“抄纸”车间克服了过去三班操作不统一的现象，改善质量，使每平方公尺的重量由六百四十公分提高到六百八十公分，抄宽由二点五五公尺增到二点七公尺，并争取提前一个月完成全年任务。“完成”车间女工李秀英以前数一令纸（五百张）需四十一秒，在听过该厂中共总支书记传达高岗同志号召后，她体会到工人阶级责任的重大，进一步发挥了积极性，数一令纸只用三十九秒。她还要争取缩短到三十七秒。
    抚顺矿务局已拟出响应高岗同志号召、为国家超计划积累五百万吨粮食的财富的具体计划，决定充分运用和发挥设备能力，争取超过生产任务、降低成本、提高质量、加速资金周转，下半年为国家增产和节约六十万吨粮食。东北森林工业总局“七一”写信给高岗同志，保证完成并超过生产任务。仅在加速资金周转中，从今年七月至明年九月末就要为国家节省流动资金二十万吨粮食。金州纺织厂职工，根据今年一月至五月超过生产任务百分之十四点六，降低成本百分之四点七六的事实，更进一步发挥工业潜力，至年底为国家增产节约十五万吨粮食。其他重要厂矿，有的在举行各种会议，拟订具体计划；有的在进一步动员职工酝酿讨论。各厂职工都准备在这一伟大的运动中，对祖国作更多的贡献。
    在恢复与重建东北工业、创建祖国工业基地的伟大事业中有着光辉贡献的东北工人阶级，现正在已有的成就上，进一步发挥特有的积极性与创造精神，为国家超计划增产与节约价值五百万吨的粮食。这一运动的胜利展开与成功，对于祖国的工业建设、国防建设，以及供给农民更多的工业品，从而满足农民需要和支援农业生产等方面，都将起巨大的作用。
