　　Errors in the Article "Introduction to the Wu Xun Problem"
Editor:
    Today, after such a long and in-depth discussion of the Wu Xun problem, it is inappropriate that the eighteenth issue of "Talking and Singing," published on June 20th, still contains an article with incorrect viewpoints, "Introduction to the Wu Xun Problem." I think this is very wrong. The author, Ji Cheng, introduced Wu Xun's motivation for running "free schools" in the first paragraph of the article, roughly stating: Wu Qi, who begged for food, "mistakenly thought" that because he had been bullied by landlords in the past, it was because he had not studied, so he wanted to raise money to run "free schools" so that "children of the poor could also study and make progress." This acknowledges that Wu Xun's motivation for "running free schools" was good; the only thing worthy of criticism is that he did not understand the problem clearly. All his sins are excused with a single word, "mistakenly." In fact, Wu Xun had been angered by landlords; he could and should have revolted (he had the conditions), and he could also have returned home to work in production (he also had the conditions). But because he did not love labor and hoped to "sit in a sedan chair carried by eight people," he chose to be a beggar and used the so-called "begging for education" as a stepping stone to sell himself to the reactionary feudal landlord class. Many critical articles have made detailed analyses of these points, but the author did not mention a word.
    The second paragraph of the article also says: At a time when imperialism and feudal forces were oppressing the peasants, running free schools was only to teach a few poor children to recite the Four Books and Five Classics, become successful, and help the ruling class oppress other poor children, "which could not solve the problem of the poor being bullied." Therefore, "sensible peasants" did not support Wu Xun. Here, the author is still defending Wu Xun's "mistake" and showing him infinite sympathy. The so-called "sensible peasants" are tantamount to saying that Wu Xun was just an "unreasonable" peasant, and his essence was good. But today, everyone knows that although Wu Xun worked for landlords when he was young, he lived a vagrant life from the beginning, and later even engaged in usury, and did not belong to the peasant class at all.
    The third paragraph only talks about the use and praise of Wu Xun by the ruling classes of past dynasties, and with the help of the reactionary ruling class at the time, he established three slave elementary schools, "so happy that he couldn't find his way, and counted himself as one of them, but still felt several generations smaller than them, and dared not sit on an equal footing with them." Here, the author did not criticize Wu Xun's reactionary essence. Why didn't Wu Xun dare to sit on an equal footing with them? This was precisely to show his slave status in order to win the favor of his masters. It was precisely because he was such a loyal slave that he won the praise of his masters. In order to consolidate his position, he had to do so, but the author did not explain this.
    From the whole article, the author did not criticize the essence of the Wu Xun spirit, and even revealed infinite sympathy for him. This fully shows that the author's own thinking is confused. The "Talking and Singing" editorial board should be responsible to the vast number of readers and should not publish such articles.

### 《说说唱唱》第十八期　《“武训问题”介绍》一文有错误

　　《说说唱唱》第十八期
　　《“武训问题”介绍》一文有错误编辑同志：
    在对武训问题已深入讨论了如此之久的今天，六月二十日出版的第十八期《说说唱唱》上仍登载了一篇观点错误的《“武训”问题介绍》。我觉得这是很不应该的。该文作者吉成，在该文的首段介绍了武训办“义学”的动机，大意谓：要饭的武七，因当年受过地主的欺负，“误以为”是因为自己没读过书，因此想弄钱办“义学”，“让穷人的孩子们也能读书上进”。这就承认了武训“办义学”的动机是好的；值得非议的，只不过是因为他对问题认识的不清楚。他的一切罪恶，用一个“误”字就给开脱了。事实上，武训曾受过地主的气，他可以而且应该革命（有条件），也可以回家生产（也有条件）。但由于他不爱劳动，希望“坐八台大轿”，所以选择了做乞丐；并以所谓“行乞兴学”向反动的封建地主阶级作卖身投靠的敲门砖。对于这些，许多批评的文章都已作了详尽的分析，而作者却只字未提。
    该文第二段又说：在当时帝国主义和封建势力的压迫下，农民不得活的时候，办义学也不过是叫少数穷孩子念四书五经，功成名就，帮助统治阶级压迫别的穷孩子，“那里能解决穷人受欺负的问题”。所以“懂事的农民”都不支持武训，这里作者仍是在对武训的“误以为”辩护；并寄以无限的同情。所谓“懂事的农民”无异说武训只不过是个“不懂事”的农民，他的本质是好的，但今天谁都知道了武训虽在年青时给地主扛过活，但自始即过着游民生活，后来更放高利贷，根本不属于农民阶级。
    第三段只说历代的统治阶级对武训的利用和捧场，并在当时反动统治阶级的帮助下，办成了三座奴才小学，“乐得他摸不着头脑，和人家算成一伙，不过还觉得比人家小几辈子，不敢和人家平起平坐。”这里作者对武训的反动本质也没加以批评。武训为什么不敢和人家平起平坐呢？这正是为了显示他的奴才身份，以取得其主子的欢心。正因为他是如此一个忠实的奴才，才博得其主子的夸奖。为了巩固他的地位，他必须如此做，作者并未予以说明。
    从全篇看来，作者对武训精神的本质是没有批判的，甚至对他流露了无限的同情。这充分说明了作者本人的思想是混乱的，《说说唱唱》编委会应对广大读者负责，不应发表这样的文章。
