　　The democratic, equal, mutually beneficial, and contractual new democratic labor-capital relationship has been basically established nationwide.

　　The establishment of the new democratic labor-capital relationship has gone through the following three stages:

　　The first stage was from the beginning of liberation to early 1950. During this period, due to insufficient understanding of the policy of "labor-capital mutual benefit and development of production" by both labor and capital, many disputes occurred. On the one hand, capitalists lacked confidence in management, closed factories, suspended operations, and reduced business on a large scale, leading to disputes over dismissal and wage arrears. On the other hand, workers, who had long been in a state of oppression and exploitation, did not correctly understand the meaning of being masters of their own destiny after liberation, resulting in excessive welfare demands, lax labor discipline, and strike actions against some capitalists. The labor-capital relationship in this stage was basically chaotic and abnormal. However, after the government and trade unions educated both labor and capital on the policy, the convening of local people's representative conferences, and the promulgation of the three major documents on handling labor-capital relations, the chaotic state of labor-capital relations was gradually improved.

　　The second stage was the period from March to June 1950, when industry and commerce experienced temporary difficulties. The nature of labor disputes was mostly dismissal, requests for reinstatement, and wage increases. Although many disputes occurred during this period, most of them were resolved through negotiation and mediation, and strikes rarely occurred. According to statistics from the labor bureaus of the four major cities of Shenyang, Beijing, Wuhan, and Tianjin, among the 2,199 dispute cases handled in the first half of 1950, 27.5 percent were resolved through negotiation, 57.9 percent were resolved through mediation, only 1.85 percent were resolved through arbitration, and only 7.5 percent were handled by the courts. This shows that labor disputes could basically be resolved according to the procedures stipulated by the government. On April 29, the Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government issued the "Instructions on Establishing Labor-Capital Consultation Meetings in Private Enterprises," and labor-capital consultation meetings were quickly established in private enterprises in major cities. This played a positive role in resolving labor disputes. Therefore, the labor-capital relationship in this stage gradually moved towards normalcy on the basis of democracy, equality, and consultation.

　　The third stage was the period since July 1950, when the business situation of industry and commerce improved. The number of dispute cases decreased significantly, and the nature of the disputes also changed substantially. According to incomplete statistics, labor bureaus in 41 cities handled as many as 12,635 dispute cases in the first half of 1950, while labor bureaus in 62 cities handled only 5,132 dispute cases in the second half of the year. Among them, dismissal cases accounted for 34.6 percent of the total cases in the first half of the year, but only 16.9 percent in the second half of the year; cases requesting reinstatement and wage increases accounted for 35.2 percent of the total cases in the first half of the year, but only 6.2 percent in the second half of the year. In this stage, the content of labor-capital consultation meetings also shifted from simply overcoming difficulties in industry and commerce and resolving disputes to focusing on production consultation, while appropriately taking care of employee welfare. For example, the labor-capital consultation meeting of the Shanghai Meiya Silk Factory, after the factory's business situation improved, focused on production consultation. On the one hand, the capitalists restored the reduced wages during the difficult period and stipulated Sunday holidays. On the other hand, the workers guaranteed to increase production and quality. As a result, the factory's output increased from 62,746 meters in September of last year to 81,680 meters in December. Currently, the labor-capital relationship is basically normal, and labor disputes can be reasonably resolved based on the principles of democracy, equality, and mutual benefit.

　　The current problems in the labor-capital relationship are mainly that labor and capital reluctantly sign comprehensive and systematic collective contracts without considering whether objective conditions are possible, resulting in formalism after the contracts are signed. Labor and capital cannot handle dismissal issues in accordance with the actual situation, resulting in many disputes. Labor and capital lack a correct understanding of the role of labor-capital consultation meetings, resulting in many labor-capital consultation meetings being suspended.

　　According to incomplete statistics, since liberation, 2,148 collective contracts have been signed in cities across the country. Signing collective contracts can specifically and clearly reflect the policy of "labor-capital mutual benefit and development of production" in the form of contracts, which plays a significant role in developing production. However, local experience proves that the problems solved by collective contracts should develop from partial to comprehensive, and from piecemeal to systematic, because the signing of collective contracts is closely related to the improvement of production technology, the rationalization of labor organization, and the establishment of various production management systems. When these conditions are met, comprehensive and systematic collective contracts can be signed; otherwise, comprehensive and systematic collective contracts should not be reluctantly signed, but rather collective contracts should be signed focusing on the current urgent and solvable problems. Currently, local labor administrative organs are promoting labor and capital to improve this situation in accordance with this spirit. Regarding the issue of dismissal, according to statistics from the Wuhan Labor Bureau, dismissal cases and some wage cases accounted for 78 percent of the labor dispute cases handled in January and February 1951. In order to correctly solve this serious problem, the Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government has proposed a policy of handling different situations separately, that is: reasonable dismissals should be allowed, unreasonable dismissals should be restricted, and capitalists who violate the Trade Union Law by retaliating against trade union cadres and dismissing activists should be criticized, and severe cases should be punished according to law. Trade unions and labor bureaus should not excessively restrict those who need to be dismissed due to production and business conditions, but should provide relief to unemployed workers after dismissal and help them find employment or change careers. Regarding labor-capital consultation meetings, the main reason why labor and capital lack a correct understanding of labor-capital consultation meetings is that they do not understand that labor-capital consultation meetings are not only the best organizational form for negotiating to overcome difficulties and resolve disputes between the two parties, but also the best organizational form for consulting on the development of production. Some capitalists, after the business situation improves, are unwilling to convene labor-capital consultation meetings because they are afraid that workers will raise demands for restoring wages and improving welfare at the labor-capital consultation meetings. Some workers also prematurely or excessively raise demands for wage increases and welfare improvements because they do not understand that production has only just begun to recover and welfare and wages cannot be demanded too much, which hinders the smooth convening of labor-capital consultation meetings. Local labor administrative organs and trade union organizations are currently paying attention to correcting this situation.

### 新民主主义的劳资关系的建立和目前存在的问题

　　新民主主义的劳资关系的建立和目前存在的问题
    民主的、平等的、两利的、契约的新民主主义的劳资关系，目前已在全国范围内基本上建立起来。
    新民主主义的劳资关系的建立，经过以下三个阶段：
    第一阶段是解放初期至一九五零年初。这一时期，由于劳资双方对“劳资两利，发展生产”的政策了解不够，发生纠纷很多：一方面是资方缺乏经营信心，大批关厂、歇业、缩减营业，而引起解雇和欠资等纠纷；另一方面是工人过去长期处于被压迫被剥削的地位，解放后对翻身作主人的意义了解不正确，产生过高的福利要求，同时劳动纪律松懈，并对某些资方采取了罢工等斗争方式。这一阶段的劳资关系基本上是混乱的、不正常的。但经过人民政府和工会对劳资双方的政策教育，各地人民代表会议的召开以及处理劳资关系的三大文件的颁布，劳资关系的混乱状态随即得到逐步改进。
    第二阶段是一九五零年三月至六月工商业发生暂时困难的时期，劳资争议性质多为解雇、要求复工和增加工资。这一时期发生的纠纷虽多，但大部分都用协商、调解等方式获得解决，罢工的事已很少发生。据沈阳、北京、武汉、天津四大城市劳动局的统计，一九五零年上半年处理的二千一百九十九件纠纷案件中，经协商解决的占百分之二十七点五，经调解解决的占百分之五十七点九，经仲裁解决的只占百分之一点八五，经法院处理的也只占百分之七点五。这说明劳资纠纷基本上已能按照政府规定程序解决了。四月二十九日，中央人民政府劳动部颁布了“关于在私营企业中设立劳资协商会议的指示”，各大城市的私营企业中随即纷纷建立了劳资协商会议。这对解决劳资争议起了良好的作用。因此，这一阶段的劳资关系即在民主、平等、协商的基础上逐步走向正常。
    第三阶段是一九五零年七月份工商业经营情况好转以来的时期。这一时期的争议案件显著减少，争议性质也基本上有了改变。据不完全统计，一九五零年上半年四十一个城市的劳动局受理争议案件多达一万二千六百三十五件，下半年六十二个城市的劳动局受理争议案件只有五千一百三十二件。其中解雇案件在上半年占总案件的百分之三十四点六，下半年只占百分之十六点九；要求复工和增加工资的案件，上半年占总案件的百分之三十五点二，下半年只占百分之六点二。在这一阶段，劳资协商会议的内容，也由单纯克服工商业困难、解决纠纷转向以协商生产为中心，并适当照顾职工福利。例如上海美亚绸厂劳资协商会议，在该厂经营情况好转后，即以协商生产为中心，一方面由资方恢复了困难时期降低了的工资，并规定了星期日的休假，另一方面由工人保证提高产量和质量。因而该厂产量就由去年九月份的六万二千七百四十六公尺增加到十二月份的八万一千六百八十公尺。目前劳资关系基本上已经正常，劳资纠纷已能根据民主、平等、两利的原则获得合理解决。
    目前劳资关系中尚且存在的问题，主要是劳资双方不看客观条件是否可能而勉强签订全面的系统的集体合同，以致合同签订后流于形式主义；劳资双方对解雇问题不能确实按照实际情况处理，以致发生不少争议；劳资双方对劳资协商会议的作用缺乏正确的认识，以致有不少劳资协商会议陷于停顿。
    据不完全统计，自解放以来，全国各城市签订的集体合同已有二千一百四十八件。签订集体合同可以使“劳资两利，发展生产”的政策在契约的形式中具体明确地体现出来，这对发展生产作用很大。但各地经验证明，集体合同所解决的问题应当是由局部的发展到全面的，由零碎的发展到系统的，因为集体合同的签订是与生产技术的提高、劳动组织的合理以及各种生产管理制度的建立密切联系着的，当这些条件具备时就可以签订全面的系统的集体合同，否则即不应勉强签订全面的系统的集体合同，而应有重点地就当前急须解决而又可能解决的问题来签订集体合同。目前各地劳动行政机关正根据这种精神，推动劳资双方来改进这方面的情况。关于解雇问题，据武汉市劳动局的统计，一九五一年一、二月份受理的劳资争议案件中，解雇案件和一部分工资案件竟占百分之七十八。为正确解决这一严重问题，中央人民政府劳动部已提出分别情况处理的方针，即：对合理解雇者应允许解雇，对不合理的解雇应予限制，对违反工会法打击工会干部解雇积极分子的资方应予批评，严重的应依法制裁。工会和劳动局不应对因生产、营业情况而需解雇者过分限制，而应以解雇后对失业工人予以救济，帮助其就业或转业。在劳资协商会议方面，劳资双方对劳资协商会议缺乏正确认识的原因，主要是不了解劳资协商会议不仅是协商克服困难解决双方争议的最好的组织形式，而且也是协商发展生产的最好的组织形式。有些资方在经营情况好转后，因为害怕工人在劳资协商会议上提出恢复工资和改善福利的要求，不愿再召开劳资协商会议。有些工人也由于不理解目前生产才开始恢复，对于福利和工资还不能要求过高，而过早或过高地提出增加工资、改善福利的要求，以致妨碍劳资协商会议的顺利召开。这种情况，目前各地劳动行政机关和工会组织正在注意纠正。
