Southwest Region Cooperative Enterprises Will See Great Development

    The Southwest Region Cooperative Affairs Bureau held its second regional cooperative work conference from June 21st to July 5th, formulating the working principles and tasks for developing cooperatives in the second half of this year. The Southwest Region Cooperative Affairs Bureau held its first cooperative work conference from November to December last year, deciding to focus on establishing cooperatives. As a result of the implementation of this resolution in various regions over the past six months, urban consumer cooperatives have gradually developed, and supply and marketing cooperatives have also been established on a trial basis in rural areas. By the end of May this year, there were 171 grassroots cooperatives in the region, with more than 230,000 members. This conference believes that the Southwest Region will have 30 million people complete land reform this autumn, and if cooperatives do not strive to develop, they will not be able to meet the needs of farmers. Therefore, the conference reviewed the current mindset among cadres of not daring to develop boldly and decided to vigorously develop cooperatives in areas where land reform has been completed. Each district should establish a cooperative, and more should be established in areas with local products, specialties, and cash crops. In areas where land reform is still in progress, county-level federation agencies should be established quickly, and key points should be selected to create experience. At the same time, in order to welcome the situation of great development of cooperative enterprises next year, the conference will train 10,000 cooperative cadres in the second half of this year. In addition, the conference also made specific decisions on the continued development of urban consumer cooperatives and the improvement of business operations.

East China Tea-Producing Areas Enjoy a Prosperous Scene

    The East China National Trading Company's spring tea purchasing work has ended, and the urban and rural economies of the tea-producing areas have seen unprecedented prosperity.

    This year, the purchasing power of tea farmers in the northern Anhui area has generally increased by about 100% compared to last year. The cloth sold by the state-owned company in the tea-producing area of ​​Fu'an, Fujian in May was equal to 18 times the average monthly sales volume from January to March. Most noteworthy is the astonishing sales volume of cultural supplies in tea-producing areas. Fountain pens sell well in tea-producing areas in southern Anhui; in Ruokou Village, Qimen County, tea farmers bought an average of two pens per household. All 27 basketballs in stock at the county's state-owned department store were also bought by tea farmers. After selling tea, many tea farmers in various places, in addition to purchasing means of production and living materials and paying off tea loans, deposited the remaining funds in state banks in large quantities. In the second half of May, more than 2,600 tea farmers in 36 tea-producing villages in Taiping County, southern Anhui, deposited 150 million yuan with the People's Bank service team.

    Since the tea season, the institutions and business of state-owned trading companies in tea areas have seen new development. Private industrial and commercial enterprises in tea-producing areas have also been further restored.

    Now the summer tea picking and production season in East China has begun. Tea farmers in Zhejiang, southern Anhui, northern Anhui, Fujian and other places are determined to continue to increase production and improve quality. Tea farmers in some villages in the tea-producing areas of Zhejiang Province have launched a patriotic production increase competition.

Central South Inspects Flood Prevention Preparations in Various Regions

    In order to strengthen flood prevention, the Central South Flood Control Headquarters and the Middle Reaches Engineering Bureau of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission recently sent personnel to the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, Dongting Lake, and along the Gan River in Jiangxi to inspect flood prevention preparations. The four inspection teams dispatched by the Middle Reaches Engineering Bureau of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission are conducting a general inspection of the Jianghan Main Embankment using drilling methods. According to preliminary inspection reports: Flood prevention organizations have been generally established in various regions. The Yangtze River middle reaches have generally organized three types of flood prevention teams: embankment protection teams, rescue teams, and reserve teams. Every kilometer along the river embankment has four flood prevention sentry posts. Nan County, Hunan Province, has installed a telephone every kilometer in the lake and river areas to mutually report water conditions. Flood prevention materials have been prepared in various places, especially along the Yangtze River. However, according to the inspection, some shortcomings still exist in flood prevention work. For example, in many places, cadres and the masses still have a paralyzing and careless mindset regarding flood prevention. During the peach blossom flood on the Gan River in Jiangxi this year, the breaches in Shitou and other places were due to the people's paralysis, believing that Shitou had not been breached for 30 years, and therefore negligence. In many other places, the embankments are not strong enough, or the height does not meet the specified standards. After the inspectors pointed out these shortcomings, various places are stepping up remedial measures. In addition, during the peach blossom flood on the Gan River in Jiangxi, the flood prevention agencies lacked calculation in leading the rescue, resulting in a lot of waste of rescue materials such as sack bags. It is estimated that the value of the rescue materials wasted in Jiangxi Province at that time was more than 3 billion yuan. The discovery of this problem has aroused great attention from the Central South Flood Control Headquarters, and it has ordered various places to pay attention to improvement.

  西南区合作事业将有大发展
    西南区合作事业管理局于六月二十一日到七月五日召开全区第二次合作社工作会议，制定了今年下半年发展合作社的工作方针与任务。西南区合作事业管理局在去年十一月到十二月间召开过第一次合作社工作会议，决定有重点地创办合作社。半年来各地执行这一决议的结果，城市消费合作社已逐步发展起来，农村中也试办了供销合作社。到今年五月底止，全区已有基层社一百七十一个，社员二十三万多人。这次会议认为：今秋西南区将有三千万人口地区完成土地改革，合作社如不力求发展，将不能满足农民的需要。因此，会议检讨了目前干部中存在的不敢放手发展的思想，并决定在已经完成土地改革地区大力发展合作社；每个区要建立一个合作社，土产、特产及经济作物地区更应多办；土地改革尚在进行的地区，应迅速建立县联社机构，并应选择重点创造经验。同时，会议为迎接明年合作事业大发展的局面，将在今年下半年内训练一万名合作社干部。此外，会议对城市消费合作社的继续发展与业务经营的改进，也作了具体决定。

  华东产茶区一片繁荣景象
    华东区国营贸易公司春茶收购工作结束，产茶区城乡经济出现了前所未有的繁荣景象。
    今年皖北区茶农的购买力一般都比去年增加一倍左右。福建福安产茶区国营公司五月份出售的布匹，等于一月份到三月份每月平均销售量的十八倍。最值得注意的是产茶区的文化用品销售量惊人，皖南产茶区畅销自来水笔；祁门县弱口村平均每户茶农买了两支。该县国营百货公司存货中的二十七个篮球，也全部被茶农买去。各地很多茶农售茶后除购买生产资料和生活资料，还清茶贷以外，把余款大量存入国家银行。皖南太平县三十六个产茶村的二千六百多家茶农，五月份下半月向人民银行服务组存款一亿五千万元。
    茶季以来，国营贸易公司在茶区的机构和业务有了新的发展。产茶区私营工商业也已进一步恢复。
    现在华东区夏茶采制时期已经开始。浙江、皖南、皖北、福建等地茶农决心继续增产，并提高品质。浙江省产茶区部分乡村茶农已展开爱国增产的竞赛。

  中南检查各地防汛准备工作
    为加强防汛，中南防汛总指挥部和长江水利委员会中游工程局，最近再度派员前往长江中游、洞庭湖和赣江沿岸各地，检查防汛准备工作。长江水利委员会中游工程局派出的四个检查组，正在对江汉干堤，用钻探的方法进行普遍检查。据初步的检查报告：各地防汛的组织都已经普遍成立了。长江中游沿岸各地普遍组织有护堤队、抢险队和预备队三种防汛队伍，沿江堤上每公里搭有四个防汛哨棚。湖南省南县在沿湖沿河地区，每公里就装设了一部电话机，用来互报水情。各地防汛材料都已准备齐全，尤以长江沿岸为好。但据检查，防汛工作中仍然存在着一些缺点。例如许多地方，干部和人民群众对防汛还有麻痹大意的思想。江西省赣江今年桃汛时，石口等地的决口，就是由于人民麻痹地认为石口已有三十年没有决口，因而疏忽所致。还有许多地方，堤防不够巩固，或者高度没有达到规定的标准。这些缺点，经检查人员指出后，各地都在加紧补救。此外，江西赣江桃汛时，由于防汛机关在领导抢险中缺乏计算，以致对麻袋等抢险物资，浪费很多。估计江西全省当时浪费的抢险物资，价值三十亿元以上。这个问题发现后引起了中南防汛总指挥部的极大的注意，已责令各地注意改进。
