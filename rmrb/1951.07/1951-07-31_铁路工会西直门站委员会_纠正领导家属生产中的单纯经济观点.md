  　Railway Workers' Union Xizhimen Station Committee
　　Corrects the Purely Economic Viewpoint in Family Members' Production

Editor:
    When the Xizhimen Station Committee of the Chinese Railway Workers' Union led the family members of employees in production, it neglected political education, forming a purely economic viewpoint.
    Since June, Xizhimen Station has transported a lot of bricks. Local employees' family members requested to participate in unloading the trucks. The union divided them into groups and assigned them unloading tasks. The family members were willing to voluntarily unload one truck per week and donate the income to purchase weapons. However, the union only organized the family members in form, without carrying out political education for them. The family members' purely money-making viewpoint was very serious. They did not pay attention to their health and safety. The truck bodies were very high, and pregnant women climbed up on three or four bricks to unload bricks. Once, a pregnant woman fell and had a miscarriage due to overwork. The groups could not unite and cooperate with each other, and often quarreled over the amount of money divided, sometimes prolonging the unloading time, affecting vehicle turnaround, and causing losses to the country.
    After criticism from local workers, the union has begun to pay attention to correcting these deviations.

### 铁路工会西直门站委员会　纠正领导家属生产中的单纯经济观点

  　铁路工会西直门站委员会
　　纠正领导家属生产中的单纯经济观点编辑同志：
    中国铁路工会西直门站委员会领导职工家属进行生产时，忽视政治教育，形成单纯经济观点。
    从六月以来，西直门站运来很多砖。当地职工家属要求参加卸车。工会就把她们划分小组，分配卸车任务。家属们并愿在每周义务卸一辆车，将收入捐献，购买武器。但是，工会只是在形式上把家属组织起来，没有向她们进行政治教育。家属们单纯赚钱观点很严重。她们不重视自己的健康和安全。车身很高，怀孕的妇女也登着三、四块砖去卸砖。有一次一个怀孕妇女就因为过度劳累而跌伤流了产。小组之间也不能互相团结合作，往往因为分钱多少而争吵，有时并因此延长卸车时间，影响车辆周转，造成国家损失。
    经当地工友提出批评后，该工会已经注意纠正这些偏向。
