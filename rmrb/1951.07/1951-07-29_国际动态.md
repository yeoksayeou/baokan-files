International Developments

  The Anger of the Austrian People
　　The Americans stationed in Neuburg, Austria, destroyed the local Austrian Communist Party branch office. This shameless act aroused strong anger among the Austrian people. In the conferences held in several enterprises, the working people demanded severe punishment for the American thugs. The employees of various enterprises in Lobau wrote to the US High Commissioner for Austria, Donnelly, saying: "We know that in the United States, it is commonplace to close down all democratic organizations, destroy their buildings, and throw their leaders into prison. But in Austria, these methods have aroused the revulsion of all honest people."
　　American imperialism believes that the more tyrannical and even rogue it becomes, the more people will fear it; in fact, this will only arouse more hatred and contempt for it.

  Two Worlds on the Same Land
　　The Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic decided to further reduce the prices of food and industrial products from July 30th. The price of rice will be reduced by 25%, sugar by 45%, and socks by 18%. The living conditions of the working people will be further improved.
　　However, in West Germany, the opposite is happening. Prices are constantly rising. From July 1950 to April 1951, the average price of grain increased by 20%, and the price of manufactured goods increased by 30%. Workers' wages, on the other hand, have been greatly reduced relatively.
　　On the same land, people have different fortunes. The increasing poverty of the people in West Germany is the inevitable result of the Adenauer puppet government's implementation of the war preparation policy of US-British imperialism.

  A Plot of National Betrayal and Humiliation
　　A delegation of right-wing political parties in the Dutch Parliament submitted a report to the Queen of the Netherlands, suggesting that the country's sovereignty be abandoned, the Parliament be abolished, and a reactionary dictatorship be established. In addition, it also suggested that the country's right to declare war be deprived, and "that others declare the Netherlands' participation in the war." They want to use the revision of the constitution to further turn the Netherlands into a thorough vassal state of the United States.
　　It is really hard to believe that the people who say these things are still Dutch.

　　国际动态
  奥地利人民的愤怒
    驻在奥地利纽堡的美国人把当地的奥地利共产党支部办公处捣毁，这一无耻行为，激起了奥地利人民的强烈愤怒。在若干企业举行的大会中，劳动人民要求严惩美国暴徒。洛堡各企业的职工们给美国驻奥高级专员董尼利的信说：“我们知道：在美国，封闭一切民主组织，捣毁属于它们的建筑物并把它们的领袖投入监狱，已经是司空见惯的事情。但在奥地利，这些方法已引起了一切正直人民的反感。”
    美帝国主义自以为它愈横暴，甚至耍无赖，人们就会害怕它；其实这只会激起人们对它的更加仇恨和鄙视。
  同一国土上的两个世界
    德意志民主共和国部长会议决定，自七月三十日起，再度降低食品和工业品的价格，大米减价百分之二十五，食糖减价百分之四十五，袜子减价百分之十八。劳动人民的生活条件将获得进一步的改善。
    但是，在西德却刚刚相反，物价在不断上涨。从一九五○年七月至一九五一年四月，粮食平均上涨了百分之二十，制成品价格上涨了百分之三十。而工人工资则相对的大大降低。
    在同一个国土上，人民却有幸有不幸。西德人民生活的日益贫困，是由于阿登纳傀儡政府执行美英帝国主义备战政策的必然结果。
  丧权辱国的阴谋
    荷兰议会中右翼各政党代表团向荷兰女王提出报告，建议放弃国家主权，取消议会，并建立反动独裁政权。此外，还建议剥夺国家的宣战权，“由别的人来宣布荷兰参战。”他们想利用修改宪法进一步把荷兰变成美国彻头彻尾的附属国。
    说这话的人，实在很难使人相信他们还是荷兰人。
