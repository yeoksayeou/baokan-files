The "August 1st" of 1951 marks the 24th anniversary of the founding of the glorious and great Chinese People's Liberation Army. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is an armed force of the people organized by the most outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people. This army was nurtured by the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and after a long and arduous struggle, overthrew the Kuomintang reactionary rule directly supported by the heinous American imperialism, and achieved the great victory of establishing a new China. The just action of the Chinese People's Volunteers in resisting America, aiding Korea, defending their homes, and defending the country has victoriously struck at the aggressive arrogance of American imperialism, and safeguarded world peace and the security of the motherland; at the same time, they are forever the defenders of our motherland and people. Without the heroic struggle of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, there would be no security for the motherland and a peaceful and happy life for the people. Therefore, our local people's governments at all levels must regard the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers as a regular and important political task, and must actively and responsibly lead the masses to do this work well, further consolidate our People's Liberation Army and strengthen national defense construction.

Our people in North China have undergone arduous training in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, and have a good tradition in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers. However, due to the victorious peaceful environment, there is a serious lack of political awareness and a slackening of fighting spirit among the leading organs and some cadres in certain areas. Therefore, in the current work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment, there are also quite serious shortcomings that urgently need to be corrected. This year, our people's governments at all levels in North China and all the people should commemorate the "August 1st" Army Day by focusing on strengthening the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment, carrying out mass movements to support the army, and effectively promoting the patriotic ideology of the masses and strengthening their political understanding of national defense construction, educating the masses to love the motherland and love the people's army. First of all, we should earnestly examine and correct the shortcomings existing in the work of preferential treatment, and effectively formulate regular and effective measures to strengthen the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to commemorate this great festival. For this reason, the main items for commemorating the "August 1st" Army Day are specifically stipulated as follows:

	1.	People's governments at all levels should conduct a serious inspection of the work of substituting for cultivation in the half-month period before and after "August 1st," and then list this inspection work as a regular system. Those families of martyrs and soldiers who are doing well in production and exemplary figures in the work of substituting for cultivation should be commended and rewarded, and their experiences should be promoted; those units and individuals who do not pay attention to this task should be criticized and educated; those leading units or individuals who seriously neglect this work, resulting in damage to the production of the families of martyrs and soldiers and thus affecting their lives, should be punished. Strictly correct the tendencies in some areas of the work of substituting for cultivation where the "martyrs, soldiers, and workers" are treated in reverse order of importance, unduly emphasizing workers and neglecting the families of martyrs and soldiers, and the tendency of "favoritism." Necessary measures should be taken to ensure that the production level of poor and labor-free families of martyrs and soldiers is not lower than that of the general public.

	2.	In accordance with the "Provisional Regulations on Preferential Treatment for Families of Revolutionary Martyrs and Families of Revolutionary Soldiers" promulgated by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central Government, conduct an inspection to ensure the conscientious implementation of the various preferential treatment measures that the families of martyrs and soldiers should enjoy. All education departments, state-owned enterprises, stores, cooperatives, health, relief, and other institutions in the entire region should conduct a serious inspection of the implementation of the various priority rights that the families of martyrs and soldiers should enjoy, and formulate future implementation measures. Strive to improve the social status of families of martyrs and soldiers and disabled soldiers in all aspects.

	3.	People's governments at all levels should, in the location of government offices, invite families of martyrs and soldiers and disabled soldiers to hold forums or conduct key individual visits by the heads of the government to understand the specific situation among them, give them spiritual comfort, and publicize the respect of the state and the people for them. Use this to promote work and expand influence.

	4.	In places where there are wounded and sick soldiers, the masses should be mobilized to conduct consolation and visits.

	5.	Wherever there are troops stationed, the local government should take the initiative to jointly hold celebration meetings or joint parties with the troops, depending on the specific situation. Appropriately organize representatives of various agencies, organizations, and local masses to participate, and invite leaders of the troops, combat heroes, families of martyrs and soldiers, and representatives of disabled soldiers to speak in order to strengthen the relationship between the army, government, and people and educate the masses.

	6.	In order to regularize the work of preferential treatment, people's governments at all levels should combine the political education of resisting America and aiding Korea, lead the masses to include the conscientious implementation of the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment as one of the contents of the patriotic convention, regularly inspect and conscientiously implement it.

The above points are to be implemented conscientiously by the people's governments at all levels in accordance with the specific circumstances, and the implementation shall be reported level by level; the people's governments of each province and city shall submit a comprehensive report to the headquarters by the end of August.

　　中央人民政府华北事务所
    关于纪念“八一”建军节
    给县级以上人民政府的指示
    一九五一年的“八一”是光荣伟大的中国人民解放军建军二十四周年纪念日。中国人民解放军是中国人民最优秀的儿女组织起来的人民武装力量。这支军队是中国人民伟大的领袖毛主席亲手培育起来的，经过长期的艰苦的斗争，推翻了万恶的美帝国主义直接支持的国民党反动统治，取得了建立新中国的伟大胜利。中国人民志愿军抗美援朝保家卫国的正义行动，胜利地打击了美帝国主义的侵略气焰，保卫着世界和平和祖国的安全；同时他们永远是我们祖国和人民的保卫者，没有中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军的英勇奋斗，就不可能有祖国的安全和人民安居乐业的生活。因此我们各级地方人民政府就必须把拥军和优待烈、军属的工作视为经常的重要的政治任务，必须积极负责领导群众做好此项工作，进一步巩固我们的人民解放军加强国防建设。
    我们华北人民，经历了抗日战争和人民解放战争的艰苦锻炼，在拥军优属工作方面，有良好的传统。但是，由于胜利的和平环境，在某些地区的领导机关和部分干部中间，存在着严重的忽视政治，松懈斗志的麻痹思想，因而在目前的拥军、优抚工作中，也存在着相当严重的缺点，亟待纠正。我们华北各级人民政府和全体人民今年纪念“八一”建军节，应以加强拥军优抚工作为中心，开展群众性的拥军运动，切实发扬群众爱国主义思想和加强对国防建设的政治认识，教育群众热爱祖国、热爱人民的军队，而首先应认真检查与纠正优抚工作中存在的缺点，切实订出加强拥军优属工作的经常有效办法，来纪念这个伟大的节日。为此特规定纪念“八一”建军节的主要事项如下：
    一、各级人民政府在“八一”前后的半个月期间内，应认真地进行关于代耕工作的检查，而后将此项检查工作列为经常制度。对生产好的烈、军属和代耕工作模范人物应加以表扬与奖励，并推广他们的经验；对不重视此项任务的单位和个人应进行批评和教育；对严重忽视此项工作以致损害烈、军属生产因而影响其生活者，其领导单位或个人则应予以处分。严格地纠正代耕工作中某些地区存在着“烈、军、工”属轻重倒置，不正确地过分重视工属，而忽视烈、军属，和“人在人情在”等偏向。应采取必要的措施，保证贫苦无劳力的烈、军属的生产水平不低于一般群众。
    二、依照中央内务部颁布之“革命烈士家属革命军人家属优待暂行条例”，对烈、军属应享受之各项优待办法，进行检查认真执行。全区各教育部门，公营企业、商店，合作社、卫生、救济等机关，应对烈、军属应享受之各种优先权的执行情况，认真地进行一次检查，并订出今后的贯彻办法。务求从各方面提高烈、军属及荣誉军人的社会地位。
    三、各级人民政府应在机关驻地，由政府首长邀请烈、军属及荣誉军人举行座谈会或进行重点的个别访问，了解他们中间的具体情况，给予他们精神上的安慰，宣传国家和人民对他们的尊敬。借此推动工作和扩大影响。
    四、有伤、病员的地方，应发动群众进行慰劳和慰问。
    五、凡有驻军的地方，视具体情况，地方政府主动地与军队联合举行庆祝会或联欢晚会。适当组织各机关、团体代表及当地群众参加，邀请部队首长，战斗英雄，烈、军属，荣誉军人代表讲话，以密切军、政、民关系，教育群众。
    六、为使优抚工作经常化，各级人民政府应结合抗美援朝政治教育，领导群众将认真执行拥军优属工作列为爱国公约内容之一，经常检查，切实执行。
    以上各点，希各级人民政府按照具体情况切实执行，并将执行情况逐级上报；各省、市人民政府务于八月底综合报告本部。
