　　The Propaganda Department of the CPC Tangshan District Committee
    Emphasizes Leadership of Radio Broadcasting Work
    Zhao Ying
    The radio broadcasting work in the Tangshan Special District was established at the beginning of this year under the leadership of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Tangshan District Committee. According to statistics from twelve counties in the district (excluding Luannan County), 2,953 radio broadcasting groups have been developed in the past six months, with more than 11,600 radio broadcasters, distributed in more than 1,500 towns and villages. At the same time, due to the timely supply of radio equipment, broadcasting stations have been generally established in various places. Blackboards have also been established accordingly.
    The propaganda departments of the county committees frequently transcribe broadcast news, compile it into "Radio Express," and distribute it to various radio broadcasting groups, and through them, the news is quickly transmitted to the broad masses. The Propaganda Department of the Yutian County Committee established a mass broadcasting room through the People's Cultural Center, organizing farmers to listen on market days. The propaganda departments of the Funing, Qian'an, Yutian, Fengrun, and Linyu county committees organized radio broadcasters to go to the countryside to carry out radio broadcasting work.
    The peasant masses call this propaganda method "living newspaper." As soon as they hear the news of the arrival of the radio, they come to participate in listening as if they were going to a fair. The folks say: "The new society is good in every way. I didn't expect that people living in the mountains could also hear people from Beijing speaking!" An old man in his sixties in Dongchengguan Village, Funing, pointed to the young children after listening to the broadcast and said: "I just caught the beginning of such a good society. You are really happy!" Farmers in Taoyuan Village, after listening to the government's call to plant more cotton, increased the planting of cotton by eighteen mu the next day.
    In March of this year, in order to expand the scope of radio work, the District Committee Propaganda Department planned and focused on selecting one district in each of Yutian, Zunhua, Luanxian, Funing, Changli, and Linyu counties to trial the establishment of district-level radio stations. In advance, education was carried out among cadres to make them understand the purpose and task of establishing district-level radio stations, and it was clearly stipulated that the district committee should control and lead this work. In addition, part-time radio broadcasters were assigned, and a strict radio work system was established, prohibiting the use of radios as a tool for pure entertainment. Technical training was conducted for radio broadcasters to teach them how to use and manage radios.
    The regular work of the radio station is to transcribe the recorded news from the Central People's Broadcasting Station, and after sorting it out, first send it to various broadcasting groups, and then distribute it by the broadcasting groups to various blackboards. In this way, the broad masses can regularly and quickly understand major events at home and abroad.
    Radio is not only a tool for educating the masses but also a good weapon for helping cadres to learn. District-level cadres currently listen to "Historical Lectures" on time. This is also the case for cadres participating in theoretical studies in Zunhua, Luanxian, and other counties. They take notes according to the progress of the lectures and conduct organized discussions.
    With the expansion of the scope of radio work, the business of the electrical materials supply and marketing cooperative has also been further developed. It not only guarantees the supply of radio equipment in the entire region and undertakes the task of repairing machines, but also uses the surplus money to purchase equipment or collect old parts to assemble dozens of radios. In addition, it also manufactured a large number of batteries.
    The radio work in the Tangshan Special District, under the leadership of the CPC Tangshan District Committee, has been developing step by step. It has not only promoted various tasks but will also become a hub linking cadres and the broad masses.

　　中共唐山地委宣传部
    重视领导收音广播工作
    赵英
    唐山专区的收音工作，是在中共唐山地委宣传部的领导下于今年年初建立起来的。据全区十二个县的统计（缺滦南县），半年来共发展收音广播小组二千九百五十三个；收音广播员有一万一千六百余名，分布在一千五百多个城镇和村庄。同时由于收音器材的及时供给，各地普遍建立起广播台。黑板报也随着建立起来了。
    各县县委宣传部经常把广播新闻抄录下来，编印成“收音快报”，发给各个收音广播小组，并通过它们把消息迅速地传到广大群众中去。玉田县委宣传部，通过人民文化馆，建立了大众播音室，每逢集日就组织农民收听。抚宁、迁安、玉田、丰润、临榆等县县委宣传部，组织收音员下乡开展收音广播工作。
    农民群众都把这种宣传方法叫作“活报纸”。他们一听见收音机来到的消息，都像赶会一样地来参加收听。老乡们说：“新社会样样好，没想到住在山沟里的人也能听到北京人说话了！”抚宁东城贯村一位六十多岁的老大爷，在听了广播以后，指着青年孩子们说：“这样好的社会，我刚赶上个头呀，你们真是幸福！”桃园村农民，听了人民政府号召多种棉花的广播，在第二天就增种了十八亩棉花。
    今年三月，为了扩大收音工作范围，地委宣传部曾有计划有重点地在玉田、遵化、滦县、抚宁、昌黎、临榆等县各选择一个区试建区级收音站。事先，在干部中进行了教育，使他们了解建立区级收音站的目的和任务，同时明确规定由区委员会掌握领导这一工作。此外，配备了兼职收音员；又建立了严格的收音工作制度，禁止把收音机当作单纯娱乐的工具。对收音员则进行了技术训练，使他们学会使用和管理收音机的方法。
    收音站的经常工作是抄收中央人民广播电台的记录新闻，经整理以后，先传送给各个广播小组，再由广播小组分发给各黑板报。这样，就使广大的群众能经常而迅速地了解国内外的大事。
    收音机不仅是教育群众的工具，而且是帮助干部学习的良好武器。专区级干部目前都按时收听“历史讲座”；遵化、滦县等县参加理论学习的干部也是如此，他们按照讲座的进度记笔记，并有组织地进行了讨论。
    随着收音工作范围的扩大，电料供应社的业务工作也有了进一步的发展。它不仅保证了全区收音机器材的供应，担负起了修理机器的任务，而且用节余的钱购买器材或搜集破旧的零件，装置了数十架收音机。此外，还制造了大量的电池。
    唐山专区的收音工作，在中共唐山地委的领导下，已一步步地开展起来；它不仅推动了各种工作，而且将成为联系干部和广大群众的枢纽。
