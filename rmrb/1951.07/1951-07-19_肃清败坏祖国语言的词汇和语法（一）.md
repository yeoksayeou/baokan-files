    Purging Vocabulary and Grammar that Corrupt the Mother Tongue (1)
    To the Editor:
    I fully support the editorial published in the People's Daily on June 6th, entitled "Correctly Use the Mother Tongue and Strive for the Purity and Health of the Language!"
    In the Northeast—a place ravaged by Japanese imperialism for fourteen years—the phenomenon of language confusion is very serious. Many words are Japanized; for example, "搬运 (bānyùn - to transport)" is said as "运搬 (yùnbān)", "负责人 (fùzérén - person in charge)" is said as "责任人 (zérènrén)", buses are called "白死 (báisǐ)", and beer is called "比鲁 (bǐlǔ)". The grammar here is also extremely chaotic. On the street, you can hear vendors saying, "钱的给? (Qián de gěi? - Money give?)" What's especially unacceptable is that many newspapers and publications are also spreading this chaotic grammar, such as "Songjiang Literature," which has many such examples in each issue. I believe that these vocabulary and grammar that corrupt the mother tongue must be purged to make our great mother tongue purer and healthier.

        (2) To the Editor:
    The editorial published in the People's Daily under the title "Correctly Use the Mother Tongue and Strive for the Purity and Health of the Language!" is of great significance today. We should strive for the purity and health of the mother tongue and resolutely oppose all phenomena that corrupt it.
    Among the phenomena that corrupt the mother tongue, I believe that the excessive use of transliterated foreign words is particularly bad. Some people like to use bizarre words like "烟士披利纯 (yānshìpīlìchún - phonetic transliteration of "inspiration")" to replace "灵感 (línggǎn - inspiration)" or other more precise Chinese words. They separate language from writing and want to create a monopoly on writing, making it difficult for the broad masses of working people to use. Therefore, I suggest that we resolutely eliminate this phenomenon that corrupts the mother tongue.

### 肃清败坏祖国语言的词汇和语法（一）

    肃清败坏祖国语言的词汇和语法（一）编辑同志：
    六月六日人民日报发表了题为《正确地使用祖国的语言，为语言的纯洁和健康而斗争！》的社论；我完全拥护。
    在东北——这曾被日本帝国主义蹂躏十四年的地方，语言混乱的现象十分严重。有许多词都是日本化的，例如把“搬运”说成“运搬”；把“负责人”说成“责任人”；把公共汽车叫作“白死”；把啤酒叫作“比鲁”。这里的语法也是极其混乱，在街上你可以听到卖东西的人说：“钱的给？”尤其不应该的，许多报纸刊物也传播着这种混乱的语法，如《松江文艺》，每期都有不少这种例子。我认为：这些败坏祖国语言的词汇和语法必须清洗掉，使我们伟大的祖国语言更纯洁，更健康。

        （二）编辑同志：
    人民日报以《正确地使用祖国的语言，为语言的纯洁和健康而斗争！》为题所发表的社论，在今天是有重大意义的。我们应当为祖国语言的纯洁和健康而努力，坚决反对一切败坏祖国语言的现象。
    在败坏祖国语言的现象中，我认为特别是滥用音译的外国语，是不好的。有些人喜欢用“烟士披利纯”等稀奇古怪的词汇，来代替“灵感”或其他更为确切的中国词。他们把语言和文字分了家，并想造成文字上的独占，使广大劳动人民难以使用它。因此，我建议应坚决扫清这种败坏祖国语言的现象。
