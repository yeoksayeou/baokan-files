Xinhua News Agency, 28th dispatch: Attempting to alleviate the difficulties of implementing war mobilization plans, the US is plotting to use Japan to control the economies of Southeast Asian countries. According to a dispatch from the Dentsu News Agency, Washington, on the 26th, Wilson, Director of the US Defense Mobilization Agency, admitted that US and Japanese industrialists plan to acquire raw materials from all of Southeast Asia and restore these countries to their pre-war colonial status as part of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." Wilson has suggested to the State Department, the Department of Defense, and the "Economic Cooperation Administration" that if the United States uses raw materials from Southeast Asia to supply Japan's unutilized industrial capacity, it will alleviate the pressure on the US economy caused by war mobilization plans. This will bring the economy of Southeast Asia under US control "as a whole," just as the economies of Western European countries are controlled by the United States through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and its economic arm, the Marshall Plan.

A jointly formed "Allied Headquarters - Japan Survey Team" is currently investigating raw material resources for Japanese industry, such as iron ore in the Philippines, Malaya, and India, bauxite in the Bauru Islands, as well as minerals, fibers, and textile raw materials.

Xinhua News Agency, 28th dispatch: Dentsu News Agency, London, 26th dispatch: A group of British Members of Parliament expressed serious concern on the evening of the 25th about the threat posed by US policy towards Japan to British interests. Liberal Party leader Davies expressed the fears of the British textile industry about the competitive threat from the US-controlled Japanese textile industry. Ashworth, the Conservative MP for Blackburn, said, "I will not go to Blackburn to promote 'Long Live Japan'." Yates, the Labour MP for North Birmingham, said, "I cannot think it is right for the British government to completely obey the wishes of the Americans." He called for immediate negotiations with the Soviet Union to improve relations. Another Labour MP, Smiths, said that it can be seen from the draft peace treaty with Japan: "Obviously, everything has been subordinated to the military needs of the United States, even British trade."

　　妄图减轻进行战争动员计划的困难
　  美阴谋利用日本控制东南亚经济
　  英一批议员忧虑美国扶植日本与英竞争
    【新华社二十八日讯】美帝国主义阴谋通过日本控制东南亚各国的经济。据电通社华盛顿二十六日讯：美国国防动员署署长威尔生供认：美国和日本工业家计划收购整个东南亚的原料，并使这个地区的国家回复它们在战前的殖民地地位，作为“大东亚共荣圈”的一部分。威尔生顷向国务院、国防部和“经济合作总署”建议，美国若以东南亚的原料供应日本未利用的工业能力，则将减轻美国自己的经济因进行战争动员计划所遭受的压力。这将使东南亚的经济在美国控制下“成为一个整体”，就像西欧国家的经济通过北大西洋战争公约和它的经济臂膀马歇尔计划而为美国所控制一样。
    一个联合组成的“盟军总部——日本考察团”，目前正替日本工业调查原料资源，如菲律宾、马来亚和印度的铁矿砂，巴鲁群岛的铁矾土，以及矿物、纤维品、纺织原料等。
    【新华社二十八日讯】电通社伦敦二十六日讯：英国下院一批议员二十五日晚对美国的对日政策所给予英国利益的威胁，表示严重忧虑。自由党领袖戴维斯表示了英国纺织界对于美国管制下的日本纺织业的竞争威胁的恐惧情绪。布莱克柏恩选区的保守党议员阿希顿说：“我是不会到布莱克柏恩去宣传‘日本万岁的’”。北明翰工党议员叶芝说：“我不能认为英国政府完全服从美国人的心意是对的”。他要求立即和苏联举行改善关系的谈判。另一个工党议员施米斯说：从对日和约草案可以看出：“很明显的，每件事都已服从于美国的军事需要，甚至英国的贸易也是如此”。
