Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 16th: "Democratic Korea" published an editorial on the 14th titled "A Just Proposal for the Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Question," supporting the specific ceasefire proposal put forward by General Nam Il, the chief representative of the Korean People's Army Supreme Command, at the first meeting of the armistice negotiations.

The editorial wrote: The ceasefire proposal put forward by General Nam Il reflects the unanimous desire of the patriotic people of Korea. The editorial pointed out: The Korean people love peace and have consistently advocated peace and fought for peace. Therefore, the Korean people enthusiastically support General Nam Il's proposal as the first step to stop the war, that is, the belligerent parties cease combat actions; determine the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line, and the armed forces of both sides simultaneously withdraw ten kilometers from the 38th parallel; make the area a demilitarized zone, and restore the civil administration of the area to the state before June 25, 1950.

The editorial pointed out: The war was launched by US imperialism. It ordered the armies of itself and its servant countries to invade Korean territory. The editorial therefore emphasized: Among the proposals put forward by General Nam Il, the most important condition is that foreign troops withdraw from our country as soon as possible. The editorial concluded: Does the US government have the sincerity to stop the war of aggression against Korea? If so, it should agree to our representative's proposal and enable it to be realized. All the Korean people are watching the attitude that the US government and the US representatives will take with keen eyes.

　　“民主朝鲜”发表社论
    支持南日将军建议
    强调外国军队应尽速撤出朝鲜
    【新华社平壤十六日电】“民主朝鲜”十四日以《和平解决朝鲜问题的正当提案》为题发表社论，支持朝鲜人民军总司令部首席代表南日将军在停战谈判首次会议上提出的具体停战建议。
    社论写道：南日将军所提出的停战建议，反映了朝鲜爱国人民一致的愿望。社论指出：朝鲜人民热爱和平，一贯主张和平，并为和平而斗争。因此，朝鲜人民热烈地支持作为制止战争的第一步的南日将军的提案，即交战双方停止战斗行为；确定三八线为军事界线，双方的武装部队同时撤离三八线十公里；使该地区成为非军事地带，并使该地区的民政恢复一九五零年六月二十五日以前的状态。
    社论指出：战争是美帝国主义发动的。它命令它和它的仆从国家的军队侵犯朝鲜领土。社论因此强调说：在南日将军所提出的建议中，最重要的条件是外国军队尽速撤出我国疆土。社论最后说：美国政府有没有停止侵朝战争的诚意呢？如果有的话，就应该同意我方代表的提案，并使其获得实现。全朝鲜人民正以敏锐的眼光，密切地注视着美国政府和美国代表所将采取的态度。
