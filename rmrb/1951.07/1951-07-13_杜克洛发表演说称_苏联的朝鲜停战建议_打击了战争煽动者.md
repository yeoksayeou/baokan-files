Xinhua News Agency, Paris, July 10th -- Tass dispatch from Paris, July 10th: Maurice Thorez, Secretary of the French Communist Party, delivered a speech on July 8th at a rally of peace fighters in Digne, Basses-Alpes, commenting on the current international situation, particularly Malik's proposal for a Korean armistice.

Duclos said: "If the sound of gunfire in Korea subsides, we should thank the Soviet Union. The Soviet proposal is in line with the wishes of the people of all countries, and therefore the United States had to accept it. This deals a blow to the warmongers. This is a victory for the forces of peace."

Duclos concluded: "We should redouble our efforts to ensure that the five major powers conclude a peace pact."

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: According to a Telepress dispatch on the 10th, the French Communist Party organ *L'Humanité* published an editorial on the Korean armistice negotiations, saying: "The Soviet Union's peace policy, the heroic achievements of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and the demand for peace from people all over the world—all this has forced those warmongering fellows to negotiate." The editorial also warned that, on the eve of the Korean armistice talks, the rulers in Washington, London, and Paris brazenly violated the Yalta and Potsdam agreements by deciding to end the state of war with West Germany. This is quite significant. The imperialists' logic is that their allies cannot nominally remain their enemies.

    苏联的朝鲜停战建议  打击了战争煽动者
    【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社巴黎十日电：法国共产党书记杜克洛七月八日在下阿尔卑斯省丁涅镇和平战士的集会上发表演说，评论目前的国际形势，特别是马立克的朝鲜停战建议。
    杜克洛说：“如果朝鲜的炮声平息下来，我们应该感谢苏联。苏联的建议符合各国人民的意愿，因此美国不得不接受。这就给了战争煽动者一个打击。这是和平力量的胜利。”
    杜克洛最后说：“我们应该加倍努力，使得五大国缔结和平公约。”
    【新华社讯】据电通社十日讯：法国共产党机关报《人道报》就朝鲜停战谈判问题发表社论说：“苏联的和平政策，朝鲜人民和中国志愿军的英雄业绩，全世界人民的要求和平——这一切使得那些穷兵黩武的家伙们不得不进行谈判。”该报社论同时又警告说，就在朝鲜停火谈判的前夕，华盛顿、伦敦和巴黎的统治者们，悍然违反雅尔塔和波茨坦协定，决定结束对西德的战争状态。这是颇为意味深长的。帝国主义者的逻辑是：他们的盟国不能在名义上仍然是他们的敌人。
