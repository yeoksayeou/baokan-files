Strive for Greater Success in Cotton Procurement and Storage

Cotton procurement and storage remains one of the most pressing and important tasks at present. Since the State Council of the Central People's Government issued the "Instructions on Cotton Procurement and Storage Work" on June 1, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the call to launch a patriotic cotton selling and storage movement, cotton-producing areas have successively launched cotton procurement and storage work. Local people's governments, especially the trade system and cooperatives, have done a lot of work. The Party organizations in some places have used great efforts to carry out the publicity and organizational work of the patriotic cotton selling and storage movement. Many Party members and members of the Communist Youth League have played exemplary roles in the cotton selling and storage movement. Many cotton farmers have also responded to the government's call. It is precisely because of these positive factors that the cotton procurement and storage work has achieved certain results. However, the planned cotton procurement and storage target was only about 50% completed in June, which is far from meeting the needs of the country.

Why was this task not completed?

The failure to complete the cotton procurement and storage task has some objective difficulties. The main one is that there were too many rural tasks in June. Cotton procurement, storage, summer grain collection, summer planting, pest control, flood prevention, and donating aircraft and artillery were all squeezed together. Many rural cadres were not good at arranging their work, which naturally had a considerable impact on cotton procurement and storage work. However, the main reason is not here. There are two main reasons: one is that many cadres and farmers have some cognitive deviations and concerns about cotton procurement and storage work. The other is the insufficient and untimely supply of materials. At present, what cotton farmers need most is wheat, cloth, and coal, and the state trade departments have not done enough in this regard; however, this situation is changing. In order to strive for greater success in cotton procurement and storage before the end of August, in addition to improving the supply of materials to cotton farmers, we should also focus on solving the ideological problems of cadres and the masses in cotton-producing areas.

What are some ideological problems in the cotton procurement and storage work among cadres?

The first problem is that some cadres do not attach importance to or do not attach enough importance to cotton procurement and storage work. They do not understand the importance of cotton procurement and storage work to the supply of clothing and price stability for the military and civilians across the country, and believe that this is a general buying and selling behavior, allowing the buying and selling parties to trade freely. Therefore, in some areas, this task is handed over to the Federation of Industry and Commerce to handle, or only to the state trade organs and cooperatives to handle, and is not regarded as a central task of the government and the Party. They do not understand the urgency of this cotton procurement and storage work in terms of time, that is, they do not understand that the task must be basically completed in the three months of June, July, and August in order to be sure to meet the needs after the resumption of work of the spinning mills. Because of these, the leading organs in some areas have not arranged this work in a timely manner. For example, a major cotton-producing area had not arranged this major task to the village by June 20, and the trade department in a certain place only began to specifically arrange this work around June 15. There were even individual organs in charge of cotton procurement and storage work, when this work was being carried out intensively, all the staff were reviewing cadres behind closed doors, and there were cases where they did not work all day. This neglect of major tasks related to the interests of the majority of the people across the country is the main obstacle to the progress of cotton procurement and storage work. This phenomenon of not attaching importance to cotton procurement and storage work is related to blind optimism in some cases; they do not yet understand the profound significance of Chairman Mao's instruction: "The serious problem is to educate the peasants."

The second problem is that some cadres underestimate the existing cotton stock of cotton farmers and have no confidence in the cotton procurement and storage work. In the case where the task was not completed in June, this pessimistic and disappointed mood may also develop. They believe that "there is not much cotton stock in the folk, and the cotton procurement task cannot be completed." This is the result of not proceeding from reality, not conducting investigation and research, and being "unaware" of the cotton stock situation. According to typical surveys and fairly cautious estimates in various cotton-producing areas, the cotton stock in the folk is roughly equivalent to 10% to 15% of last year's total cotton production, that is, at least 1.5 million dan or so. From the survey in some areas, it even exceeds this number. Also from the actual situation of cotton procurement and storage work, it proves that underestimating the amount of cotton stock is not in line with the facts. For example, in Beiyukou Village, Cheng'an County, Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province, the cadres initially had no confidence in the cotton procurement work, thinking that they could collect up to 2,000 jin, but the masses took out 10,180 jin. The Northwest Trade Department initially believed that there was not much cotton stock in Guanzhong, the main cotton-producing area, and therefore did not actively carry out cotton procurement work. However, later, as a result of the cooperative organization's vigorous publicity and mobilization in Jingyang County, Guanzhong, the number of cotton procurement and storage greatly exceeded the planned target. These facts prove that underestimating the amount of cotton stock of cotton farmers is wrong, and pessimism and disappointment are unfounded.

The third problem is that some cadres are not correctly using the method of combining political mobilization and material exchange, but are already or are attempting to use coercive orders to complete this serious task. The method of taking coercive orders for cotton procurement and storage basically reflects a mood of failure. Facts have proved that coercive orders will not work, because the more coercion, the greater the concerns of cotton farmers, and the less willing they are to sell cotton. Doing so will not only make it difficult to complete the current task, but also have a negative impact on the future promotion of cotton planting and the strengthening of the worker-peasant alliance, this basic political task. On the other hand, some people advocate using purely commercial methods to purchase cotton farmers' cotton. They oppose open political mobilization. They believe that the reason why the cotton procurement and storage task has not been completed is the mistake of open mobilization. They think that if the news of the spinning mills' shutdown is not told to the farmers, and the purchase is carried out as usual, the effect will definitely be better than open mobilization. The acquisition results in June were not as good as in May, and they believed that this was evidence that open mobilization was bound to fail. This thinking underestimates the level of awareness of the peasants in the new China, and believes that the cotton farmers' selfish and self-interested psychology has reached an incurable level. In fact, as long as political mobilization can be carried out correctly, deeply, and universally, and combined with a correct material supply plan, it can achieve good results. The experience of typical experiments in various places has answered this question.

The fourth problem is that many local work cadres do not understand that when carrying out such a serious task as emergency cotton procurement and storage, they should adopt a policy of patriotic education and market management for cotton merchants. In May and June, various places generally adopted a policy of laissez-faire for cotton merchants. We advocate and implement free domestic trade, but this refers to free trade within the state's unified economic plan, not unrestricted free trade. Article 37 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference clearly stipulates: "Freedom of domestic trade shall be implemented within the framework of the state's unified economic plan, but speculative commerce that disrupts the market must be strictly prohibited." It can be seen from this that it is absolutely not allowed for private merchants to take advantage of the state's urgent need for cotton to undermine the state's reasonable price by constantly raising market prices. Some people do not know how to lead private merchants, but instead demand that the list price be raised again and again to act as the tail of private merchants, which is completely wrong. This will not only fail to stop the manipulation of private merchants, but will further create market chaos and cotton farmers' reluctance to sell. The experience of Hebei Province proves that only by strictly managing the market and strengthening patriotic education for private cotton purchasers can the price of cotton be effectively stabilized. For example, Jin County held a meeting of 34 cotton peddlers, conducted education on resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and promoting the patriotic convention, and stipulated specific market management methods. Thirty of them automatically sold 15,000 jin of cotton to the state and proposed to guarantee assistance to the government to stabilize prices. This experience should be learned by all places.

The reason why the cotton procurement and storage work has not completed the task is not only a problem in the leading ideology, but also some ideological problems on the part of the cotton farmers.

"Reluctance to sell in anticipation of rising prices" is the main ideological obstacle to cotton farmers' unwillingness to sell and store cotton immediately. According to survey materials from various places, the existing cotton stocks in rural areas are mainly in the hands of old middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasants. Due to the victory of the people's democratic revolution, their lives are becoming increasingly prosperous, and they do not need money urgently. Their purpose of storing cotton is to wait for high prices in order to obtain greater profits. Under the current economic conditions of farmers, it is natural for farmers to have this kind of thinking, but this kind of thinking is wrong. Our task is to persuade farmers to change this thinking and make farmers understand the correct relationship between themselves and the new country. First of all, it should be clear that it is the responsibility of cotton farmers to sell cotton. In the new China (the same is true in all countries where the revolution has been successful), the main social division of labor for farmers in restoring and developing the country's production is to supply grain and industrial raw materials. For this purpose, the state has formulated a series of policies that are beneficial to both the public and private sectors for farmers. Therefore, if farmers cannot complete the task, it is first of all because they have not fulfilled their responsibilities. Secondly, with regard to the working class and industry, farmers should correctly recognize its leading role for the peasant class and agriculture. For farmers in areas where land reform has been implemented, in the past, if there was no working class (the Communist Party is the political party of the working class), it would have been impossible for farmers to overthrow the landlord class and obtain land and democracy; now and in the future, without the working class and modern industry, it would be impossible to improve the productivity and living standards of farmers. The fabrics, coal, bean cakes, waterwheels, pest control equipment, bicycles, and Mei Lanfang mirrors that are now universally welcomed by cotton farmers cannot be achieved without the working class and industry. The reason why cotton is receiving special attention now is precisely the result of the initial recovery and development of the textile industry. Indifference to the difficulties of the working class and industry will make oneself lose the future. Third, cotton farmers should support the call of the People's Government for cotton procurement and storage. Cotton farmers are now relatively wealthy, which is a good thing. But this is inseparable from the leadership of the People's Government. Under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, this kind of wealth was completely impossible, and the farmers themselves have this experience. For the old middle peasants who did not receive land in the land reform, their position in the new China is also completely different from that in the old China. In the old China, they were the oppressed, now, they are the masters, and the state is no longer a machine that exploits them, but a machine that protects their due interests. Fourth, the People's Government's price policy should also be explained to cotton farmers. The People's Government is adopting a policy of stabilizing prices. Before March of the previous year and last year, due to price fluctuations, cotton farmers had obtained greater benefits from cotton prices. This situation is unlikely to be repeated in the future. Therefore, this year, under the circumstances that the reasonable ratio of cotton to grain has been absolutely guaranteed, the idea of "waiting for a price to sell" for cotton is not only wrong, but also impossible to realize.

In addition to this, cotton farmers now have some ideological concerns. The main concern is the fear of "revealing wealth," and some middle peasants are also afraid of raising their class status because of this. This is the result of their not thoroughly understanding the economic policies of the People's Republic of China. First of all, class status is determined by the relations of production, that is, the relationship of possession of the means of production, not by the amount of wealth, and it will never affect the status just because of selling more cotton. Not only that, but the People's Government is working hard to "restore and exceed the pre-war production level of grain, industrial raw materials, and export goods" in accordance with Article 34 of the Common Program "according to the needs of the national plan and the people's livelihood." Cotton is one of the important industrial raw materials, and the People's Government is vigorously rewarding and helping farmers to plant it. How can there be any reason to crack down on farmers who sell more cotton instead?

Some cotton farmers are afraid of forced loans, so they dare not sell cotton. Wherever forced loans are implemented in the name of "free loans," they should be resolutely corrected. The policy of the People's Government is to advocate freedom of lending. If there is any behavior that violates the above principles, farmers have the right to appeal to the local government.

Another concern of farmers is the fear of donating all the cotton they sell to aircraft and artillery. In some places, cotton procurement and storage work and the donation of aircraft and artillery were arranged and mobilized at the same time, calling such a mobilization meeting: "Patriotic Cotton Selling and Storage Donation Aircraft and Artillery Conference," which is of course easy to cause misunderstandings. It should be made clear to the farmers that the "Notice on Specific Measures for Donating Weapons to Support the Chinese People's Volunteers" issued by the General Association of the Chinese People to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea on June 7 clearly stipulates the donation principle of "must be completely voluntary, and no one shall be forced to donate." Therefore, there should be no forced phenomena. Selling cotton for storage and donating aircraft and artillery are two different things, and there should be no misunderstanding because of this.

The task of cotton procurement and storage is arduous, and the time is pressing. The leading organs in cotton-producing areas should regard this as the most important work at present; they must conscientiously do a good job in publicity and clarify the confused thinking among cadres and the masses. Now is the season for cotton to exchange for wheat. After August, new cotton will be on the market soon, and many farmers have the habit of "not seeing both new and old"; the cotton procurement work in various places has also been generally arranged to the village, and the supply of materials is also being strengthened; as long as the cadres and the masses in the cotton-producing areas across the country work together, the cotton procurement and storage work will surely have greater success, and we should strive for this.

### 为购棉储棉的更大成绩而斗争

　　为购棉储棉的更大成绩而斗争
    购棉储棉，仍是目前紧迫的重要任务之一。自六月一日中央人民政府政务院发布了《关于购棉储棉工作的指示》，中共中央发出了开展爱国售棉储棉运动的号召以后，各产棉区先后开展了购棉储棉工作；各地人民政府、特别是贸易系统和合作社，做了不少工作；有些地方党的组织用很大力量开展了爱国售棉储棉的宣传运动和组织工作；许多地方的党团员在售棉储棉运动中，起了模范作用；许多棉农也响应了政府的号召；正由于这些积极的因素，使购棉储棉工作得到了一定的成绩。但是，预定的购棉储棉任务，在六月份只完成了约百分之五十，这是远不能满足国家需要的。
    为什么没有完成这个任务呢？
    购棉储棉任务之所以没有完成，客观的困难是有的。这主要是，在六月份，农村任务太多，购棉、储棉、夏征、夏种、除虫、防汛、捐献飞机大炮等挤在一起，许多农村干部还不善于安排自己的工作，这对于购棉储棉工作，当然有相当的影响。但是，主要的原因不在这里，主要原因有两个：一个是，许多干部和农民群众对于购棉储棉工作，有些认识上的偏差和顾虑。另一个是，物资供应不足和不及时。在目前棉农所需要的主要是小麦、布和煤，国家贸易部门在这一方面还有些工作没有作到；不过，这种情况，正在改变中。为了争取购棉储棉在八月底以前能有更大的成绩，除应改进对棉农的物资供应工作外，还应当注重解决产棉区干部和群众的思想问题。
    在购棉储棉工作上，在干部方面有些什么思想问题呢？
    首先一个问题，是有些干部不重视或不够重视购棉储棉工作。他们不了解，购棉储棉工作对于全国军民衣着的供应和物价的稳定的重要性，认为这是一般的买卖行为，让买卖双方自由地交易就行了，因此，有些地区，把这一任务交给工商联合会去办，或者仅仅交给国家贸易机关和合作社去办，并不作为政府和党的工作的一个中心。他们更不了解这次购棉储棉工作在时间上的迫切性，即不了解必须在六、七、八三个月基本上完成任务，才能有把握地满足纱厂复工以后的需要。因为这些，有些地区的领导机关布置这一工作就很不及时，如某主要产棉区到了六月二十日还未把这一重大任务布置到村，某地贸易部门到六月十五日左右才开始具体布置这一工作，甚至有个别主管购棉储棉工作的机关，在这一工作正在紧张进行的时候，全部人员都在关门审查干部，有成天不办公的情形。这种对有关全国大多数人民利益的重大任务的忽视，就是购棉储棉工作进行的主要障碍。这种不重视购棉储棉工作的现象，在有些情形下，与盲目乐观情绪有关；他们还不了解毛主席所指示的：“严重的问题是教育农民”的深刻意义。
    第二个问题，是有些干部低估了棉农现有的存棉数量，对购棉储棉工作没有信心。在六月份任务没有完成的情况下，这种悲观失望情绪，还可能发展。他们认为“民间存棉本来不多，购棉任务无法完成”。这是不从实际出发，没有调查研究，对存棉情况“心中无数”的结果。根据各产棉区的典型调查和相当审慎的估计，民间存棉大抵相当于去年棉产总量百分之十到百分之十五，即最低有一百五十万担上下。从有些地区的调查来看，甚至还超过这个数目。又从购棉储棉工作的实际情形来看，也证明过低估计存棉数量是不合事实的。如河北邯郸专区成安县北鱼口村，干部开始对购棉工作毫无信心，认为最多能收购二千斤，结果群众却拿出了一万零一百八十斤。西北贸易部门开始认为主要产棉区关中的存棉已不多，因而不积极展开购棉工作，但是后来经过合作社组织在关中泾阳县大力宣传动员的结果，购棉储棉数字大大超过预定计划。这些事实都证明：低估棉农存棉数量是不对的，悲观失望是没有根据的。
    第三个问题，是有些干部不是正确地运用政治动员和物资交换相结合的方法，而是已经或正在企图用强迫命令的方法，来完成这一严重任务。对于购棉储棉采取强迫命令的方法，基本上反映了一种失败情绪。事实证明，强迫命令是行不通的，因为愈强迫，棉农的顾虑愈大，他们愈不肯卖棉花。这样作，不但目前任务不易完成，而且对于今后推广植棉，以及加强工农联盟这个基本政治任务，都将有不良影响。另一方面，还有些人主张用单纯商业方法去收购棉农的棉花，他们反对公开的政治动员。他们认为：现在购棉、储棉任务之所以没有完成，是公开动员的错误。他们以为如果不把纱厂停工的消息告诉农民，实行平时一样的收购，效果必然比公开动员好一些。六月份收购成绩反而不如五月份，他们认为即是公开动员必然失败的证据。这种思想，是过低估计了新中国农民的觉悟程度，认为棉农的自私自利心理已到无可救药的程度。事实上，只要政治动员能够正确深入与普及，并与正确的物资供给计划相结合，是能收到良好的效果的。各地典型试验的经验，已经回答了这个问题。
    第四个问题，是许多地方工作干部不懂得在进行紧急购棉储棉这样严重的任务时，对于棉花商贩应当采取爱国主义的教育和市场管理政策。在五、六月份，各地对于棉花商贩，一般采取了自由放任的政策。我们是主张并且实行国内贸易自由的，但是这是指在国家统一的经济计划内的贸易自由，而不是毫无限制的贸易自由。中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第三十七条明白地规定：“在国家统一的经济计划内实行国内贸易的自由，但对于扰乱市场的投机商业必须严格取缔。”由此可见，私人商贩乘着国家紧急需棉的时机，用不断提高市价的方法，打击国家的合理牌价，是绝对不能允许的。有些人不知对私商进行领导，反而要求一再提高牌价，去作私商的尾巴，是完全错误的。这样，不但不能停止私商的操纵，反而更进一步造成市场的混乱与棉农的惜售心理。河北省的经验证明，只有严格管理市场，加强对购棉私商爱国主义的教育，才是稳定棉价的有效方法。如晋县召开三十四个棉贩会议，对他们进行抗美援朝与推行爱国公约的教育，并规定了具体的市场管理办法后，其中三十个人即自动把一万五千斤棉花卖给国家，并提出要保证协助政府稳定物价。这个经验各地都应学习。
    购棉储棉工作之所以没有完成任务，不但在领导思想方面有问题，在棉农方面也是有一些思想问题的。
    “看涨惜售”，是棉农不愿立即售棉、储棉的主要思想障碍。根据各地调查材料，农村现有存棉，主要是在老中农与富裕中农手中。由于人民民主革命的胜利，他们的生活日渐富裕，不等钱用。他们存棉的目的是等待高价，以图获得更大的利润。在目前农民的经济条件下，农民有这种思想是很自然的，但这种思想是错误的。我们的任务就是要说服农民改变这种思想，使农民懂得自己和新国家的正确关系。首先应当明白，棉农卖棉花是自己的责任。在新中国（在一切革命已经成功的国家都一样），农民在恢复和发展国家生产事业中的社会分工中，主要就是供给粮食和工业原料，为了这一个目的，国家曾对农民制定了一连贯的公私两利的政策。因此，农民如果不能完成任务，首先就是自己没有尽到责任。其次，对于工人阶级，对于工业，农民应当正确认识它对于农民阶级和农业的领导作用。对于已实行土地改革地区的农民来说，在过去，如果没有工人阶级（共产党即工人阶级的政党），农民就不可能推翻地主阶级，得到土地和民主；在现在和今后，如果没有工人阶级和近代工业，农民的生产力和生活水平，就不可能提高。现在棉农普遍欢迎的布匹、煤、豆饼、水车、治虫药械、自行车以及梅兰芳镜子等，没有工人阶级和工业是办不到的。现在棉花之所以受特殊重视，也正是纺织工业初步恢复和发展的结果。对工人阶级和工业的困难，漠不关心，将使自己失去前途。第三，棉农应当拥护人民政府的购棉储棉号召。棉农现在生活比较富裕，这是好事情。但这是和人民政府的领导分不开的。在国民党反动统治时期，这种富裕的现象，是完全不可能的，农民本身是有这个经验的。对于在土地改革中没有分到土地的老中农来说，他们在新中国的地位，也和旧中国完全不相同。在旧中国，他们是被压迫者，现在，他们是主人，国家不再是剥削他们的机器，而是保护他们应得利益的机器了。第四，还应向棉农说明人民政府的物价政策。人民政府是采取稳定物价政策的，在前年和去年三月以前，由于物价波动，棉农曾在棉价上得到较大利益，这种情况，以后是不可能重复的。因此，在今年，在棉粮合理比价已有绝对保证的情形下，对于棉花仍采取“待价而沽”的想法，不仅是错误的，也是不可能实现的。
    除此之外，棉农现在还有若干思想顾虑。主要的顾虑是怕“露富”，有些中农还怕因此提高成份。这是由于他们还不彻底了解中华人民共和国的经济政策的结果。首先，阶级成份是按生产关系，即对于生产资料的占有关系来决定的，而不是按财富的多少来决定的，决不会因为多出卖了多少棉花就会影响成份。不仅如此，人民政府正按共同纲领第三十四条的规定：“根据国家计划和人民生活的需要”，努力“恢复并超过战前粮食、工业原料和外销物资的生产水平”。棉花是重要工业原料之一，人民政府正以大力奖励和扶助农民种植，那有对于多卖棉花的农民反而加以打击的道理。
    有些棉农怕强迫借贷，因而不敢卖棉花。凡有以“自由借贷”为名，实行强迫借贷的地方，应坚决加以纠正。人民政府的政策，是主张借贷自由的。如果有违反以上原则的行为，农民是有权向当地政府申诉的。
    农民另一种顾虑，是怕把所卖棉花都捐了飞机大炮。有些地方把购棉储棉工作与捐献飞机大炮同时布置，同时动员，称这样的动员大会为：“爱国售棉储棉捐献飞机大炮大会”，这当然容易发生误会的。应当向农民讲清楚，中国人民抗美援朝总会六月七日《关于捐献武器支援中国人民志愿军的具体办法的通知》上，已明白规定“必须完全出于自愿，任何人不得强迫”的捐献原则，因此，也不应当发生强迫的现象。售棉储棉与捐献飞机大炮是两件事，不能因此发生误会。
    购棉储棉的任务是艰巨的，时间是紧迫的。棉产区的领导机关，应当把这作为当前头等重要的工作来做；要认真做好宣传工作，把干部中和群众中的混乱思想加以澄清。现在正是棉花换麦子的季节，八月以后，新棉花即将上市，许多农民有“新旧两不见”的习惯；各地购棉工作，也一般已经布置到村，物资供给也在加强中；只要全国产棉区干部和群众，一齐努力，购棉储棉工作一定会有更大成绩，我们应当为此而奋斗。
