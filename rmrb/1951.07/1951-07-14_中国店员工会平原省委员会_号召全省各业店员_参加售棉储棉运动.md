The work of purchasing and storing cotton has reached a critical juncture. The China Store Employees Union of Pingyuan Province issued an instruction on July 1st, calling on all store employees in the province to take immediate action and do the following work well:

	1. Store employees' union organizations at all levels should immediately convene meetings of all members, or organize study and discussion through symposiums and group meetings, to convey the calls of the government and the Communist Party, clear the minds of store employees, so that store employees gain a correct understanding of cotton selling and storing, and further mobilize the shopkeepers, family members, parents and relatives who have cotton in storage, and persuade them to sell or store the cotton to the state.

	2. Launch an "patriotic letter writing" campaign to write letters, explain the principles clearly, and advise shopkeepers, family members, parents, and relatives to immediately sell cotton to the state. The trade union committees of cities and counties should grasp the working situation, and should promptly commend exemplary deeds; and should incorporate this mobilization work more specifically into the patriotic conventions of the grassroots teams.

	3. The trade union grassroots committees of institutions such as cooperatives, cotton and yarn companies, and the People's Bank should launch work competition campaigns with this as the content, to ensure the work of purchasing, storing, transporting, storing, and exchanging, to provide convenience to cotton farmers, and to simplify procedures. All employees of cotton and yarn companies and the People's Bank should guarantee the implementation of the "Cotton Selling and Storing Contract", and the employees of the cooperatives should vigorously expand the propaganda and mobilization work for the members to ensure the completion of the "Cotton Purchasing Contract" signed with the cotton and yarn company.

	4. The trade union grassroots committees of trade companies, cooperatives, and the People's Bank at all levels should realize that cotton purchasing is the current central task in economic work, and all employees should cooperate closely with each other with the greatest enthusiasm and support each other, and strive to make greater achievements in cotton purchasing and storing. Department stores, retail companies and other trade union committees should make the greatest efforts to cooperate with private stores to supply the needs of cotton farmers. (Finance)
