The National Literary and Art Work Troupe Conference convened by the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government has preliminarily summarized the achievements and experiences of literary and art work troupes in artistic and propaganda work, and defined the future direction and tasks.

Literary and art work troupes, commonly referred to as "wen gong tuan" (cultural work troupes), are one of the important organizational forms of revolutionary art and propaganda work. The predecessor of the "wen gong tuan" was the Red Army's propaganda team. As early as the Gutian Conference of the Fourth Army of the Red Army in December 1929, Chairman Mao gave a full assessment of the role of the propaganda team. He believed that the Red Army's propaganda team was an important tool for the Red Army's propaganda work, and therefore the Party must strive to manage and train the propaganda team. The literary and art work troupes, which developed from the Red Army propaganda teams, and the drama troupes formed by progressive drama workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas in the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, merged together to develop into a new artistic fighting force of tens of thousands of revolutionary drama, music, and dance workers today. The development history of the "wen gong tuan" has always been combined with the Chinese people's revolutionary war and democratic construction. Over the past twenty years, they have done a lot of heroic, arduous, and glorious work in mass propaganda.

Since the national liberation, the people in the vast new areas, especially the peasants after the land reform, have a very urgent demand for new culture, and the existing local "wen gong tuan" are far from meeting their needs. At the same time, the original nature of the "wen gong tuan" as a mobile propaganda team can no longer fully adapt to the new environment after entering the cities. In the past two years, the local "wen gong tuan" targeting peasants as the main audience has developed considerably; on the other hand, the "wen gong tuan" in large cities have also begun to embark on the path of theaterization. Among the programs performed by the "wen gong tuan", the more successful ones in drama include "Red Flag Song," "Growing Up in Battle," and "Dragon Beard Ditch," and in opera include "Steel Warrior" and "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang." New operas and new dances are continuing to gain new experiences in their own creative process.

This conference stipulated that the general task of the national "wen gong tuan" work is to vigorously develop new people's operas, new dramas, new music, and new dances, and to educate the broad masses of people with revolutionary spirit and patriotic spirit. This is completely correct. These new art forms, because they express new revolutionary content, have played a huge role in mobilizing and educating the broad masses, and have been loved by the broad masses. However, these new art forms are relatively young, and therefore not completely mature. Therefore, to popularize new art to the masses and further develop and build new art on the basis of popularization requires a great and persistent effort. The National Opera Work Conference convened by the Ministry of Culture last year decided to encourage free competition among various opera forms in order to achieve the goal of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new." The work of the "wen gong tuan" should be divided and cooperated with the opera reform work. That is to say, on the one hand, we should vigorously reform the old operas and turn them into new operas, and on the other hand, we should vigorously develop new operas, new dramas, new music, and new dances to make them further popular and nationalized. The two aspects complement each other and work together towards the overall goal of building a national new art.

In order to enable various "wen gong tuan" to adapt to various different needs, the conference stipulated the following general division of labor for various national "wen gong tuan" (except for the "wen gong tuan" belonging to the armed forces and mass organizations such as trade unions and the Communist Youth League, which will be stipulated separately):

I. The central major administrative regions and large cities should establish theaters or specialized troupes (such as opera troupes, drama troupes, song and dance troupes, etc.). These theaters or troupes should have fixed theaters and a certain number of programs that can be performed regularly, so as to gradually build theater art; at the same time, they should allocate appropriate time and manpower to conduct demonstrative touring performances in various places.

II. Each province (administrative office, autonomous region) and each medium-sized city should establish a troupe or a "wen gong tuan" mainly engaged in drama performances; its activities should focus on both theater performances (in the provincial capital) and touring performances (in subordinate cities and rural areas). When conditions permit, it can be divided into two teams, one team often performing touring performances.

III. Special districts should establish comprehensive "wen gong dui" mainly engaged in drama or singing, depending on needs and possibilities, and mainly use short drama forms or singing forms to perform touring performances in rural areas and small towns.

Among the existing "wen gong tuan" (teams) in the country, the "wen gong tuan" (teams) that mainly target rural areas and small towns and mainly engage in touring performances are the most numerous, which is completely suitable for the needs of the broad masses today and is also the main direction of future development. Establishing specialized troupes or theaters with fixed theaters is necessary, but this can only be done in large cities and under other necessary conditions. Therefore, in general, "wen gong tuan" should not demand specialization prematurely and inappropriately. The eyes of the "wen gong tuan" members should always look downward, looking at the masses. The "wen gong tuan" can only achieve proper development and improvement in longer and more in-depth mass work.

All "wen gong tuan", from the highest-level theater to the smallest "wen gong dui", should attach importance to and strengthen the guidance work for the amateur artistic activities of the masses. The amateur artistic activities of the working class and peasants in our country, the amateur drama troupes in rural factories, and other cultural and recreational organizations have now developed to an unprecedented scale. Each "wen gong tuan" should establish a fixed and regular guidance relationship with the amateur artistic organizations in factories and rural areas within a certain range, so that on the one hand, it can absorb nourishment from the creation of the masses, and on the other hand, it can effectively help and guide the cultural life of the broad masses and their artistic creation activities.

To strengthen the "wen gong tuan", we must first strengthen the attention and leadership of the cultural authorities of governments at all levels to the "wen gong tuan". The cultural authorities of governments at all levels should regularly discuss the work of the "wen gong tuan", specifically stipulate the work tasks of the subordinate "wen gong tuan" at each period, especially stipulate the creation and performance plans and learning plans of the "wen gong tuan", and check their implementation. The "wen gong tuan" has always been a kind of school for training artistic cadres; in the future, we should establish and strengthen the learning system for the members of the "wen gong tuan" to improve their political and artistic cultivation level, so as to gradually cultivate a large number of outstanding actors, directors, music, dance, and other artistic talents in the practical work exercise. The work of the "wen gong tuan" is intense, and many members of the "wen gong tuan" have worked in difficult conditions for a long time; the leadership should pay great attention to protecting their health, especially to protecting the physical strength and singing voice necessary for their performances. All specialized art schools should regard the task of transferring and training the on-the-job cadres of the "wen gong tuan", guiding and assisting the amateur learning of the "wen gong tuan" as an important task. Since creation is the soul of the "wen gong tuan", the leadership should take effective steps to strengthen the leadership of creation, organize creation in a planned way, and centrally use creative forces to overcome the past spontaneous state of decentralized creative forces and lack of centralized leadership.

Under the leadership of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line, the "wen gong tuan" has achieved preliminary results. They are facing very arduous tasks, so they must not be complacent in the slightest. In the future, they should carry forward their fine traditions, further integrate with the masses, and strive to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line and vigorously develop new people's operas, new dramas, new music, and new dances.

### 加强文艺工作团，发展人民新艺术

　　加强文艺工作团，发展人民新艺术
    中央人民政府文化部召开的全国文艺工作团工作会议，初步总结了文艺工作团在艺术工作与宣传工作上的成绩和经验，规定了今后的方针和任务。
    文艺工作团，平常简称为文工团，是革命的艺术工作和宣传工作的重要组织形式之一。文工团的前身是红军的宣传队。毛主席早在一九二九年十二月红军第四军的古田会议中，就对宣传队的作用作了充分的估计。他认为红军的宣传队，是红军宣传工作的重要工具，因此党必须努力于宣传队的管理和训练。由红军宣传队发展起来的文艺工作团，和抗日战争初期在国民党统治区由进步戏剧工作者所组成的演剧队，两股力量汇合起来，就发展为今天拥有数万革命的戏剧、音乐、舞蹈工作者的一支新文艺的战斗部队。文工团的发展历史，是一直和中国人民革命战争与民主建设相结合的。二十年来，他们在群众宣传工作方面做了很多英勇的艰苦的光荣的工作。
    全国解放以后，广大新区人民，特别是经过土地改革后的农民，对于新文化的要求很迫切，现有的地方文工团远不能满足他们的需要。同时文工团原来带有的流动宣传队的性质，又已不能完全适应进入城市后的新的环境。两年以来，以农民为主要对象的地方文工团有相当大的发展；另一方面，大城市的文工团也开始走上剧院化的道路。文工团演出的节目中，比较成功的在话剧方面有《红旗歌》、《在战斗里成长》、《龙须沟》等，在歌剧方面有《钢铁战士》、《王贵与李香香》等。新歌剧、新舞蹈在它们自身的创造过程中，正继续取得新的经验。
    这次会议，规定了全国文工团工作的总任务是大力发展人民的新歌剧、新话剧、新音乐、新舞蹈，以革命精神和爱国精神教育广大人民。这是完全正确的。这些新的艺术形式，由于表现了新的革命的内容，对广大群众起了巨大的动员与教育的作用，并已为广大群众所喜爱。但是这些新的艺术形式都是比较年青的，因而也是不完全成熟的。因此，要把新艺术普及到群众中去，并在普及的基础上进一步发展与建设新艺术，还需要有一个极大的坚持不懈的努力。去年中央文化部召开的全国戏曲工作会议，决定鼓励各种戏曲形式自由竞赛，以达到“百花齐放，推陈出新”的目的。文工团的工作，应当与戏曲改革工作分工合作。这就是说，应当在一方面大力改革旧有戏曲，使之变成新的戏曲，另一方面大力发展新歌剧、新话剧、新音乐、新舞蹈，使之进一步地大众化、民族化，两方面相辅相成，共同地向着建设民族的新艺术的总目标努力。
    为了使各种文工团适应各种不同需要，会议规定全国各种文工团（除部队文工团及工会、青年团等群众团体所属的文工团另行规定外）的大体上的分工如下：
    一、中央各大行政区及大城市设剧院或专门化的剧团（如歌剧团、话剧团、歌舞团等）。这种剧院或剧团，应当做到有固定剧场及一定数量的能经常上演的节目，借以逐步建设剧场艺术；同时分出适当的时间和人力到各地作示范性的巡回公演。
    二、各省（行署、自治区）及各中等城市设剧团或以演剧为主的文工团；其活动方式是剧场演出（在省会）与巡回公演（在所属城市、农村）并重，在有条件时，可以分为两队，一队经常作巡回公演。
    三、专区视需要与可能设以演剧或演唱为主的综合性文工队，主要运用短小戏剧的形式或演唱的形式，在农村与小城镇巡回演出。
    在全国现有各种文工团中，以农村及小城镇为主要对象，以巡回演出为主要活动方式的文工团（队）为数最多，这是完全适合今天广大群众的需要的，也是今后发展的主要方向。建立有固定剧场的专门化的剧团或剧院是需要的，但这只有在大城市并具备其它必要的条件下，才能做到。因此一般文工团不可过早的、不适当的要求专门化。文工团员的眼睛，应当永远看着下面，看着群众。文工团只有在更长久、更深入的群众工作中，才能得到正当的发展和提高。
    所有文工团，从最高级的剧院到最小型的文工队，都应当重视与加强对群众的业余艺术活动的辅导工作。我国工农群众的业余艺术活动，农村工厂的业余剧团及其它文娱组织，目前已发展到空前广大的规模。每个文工团都应当在一定范围内，与工厂农村的业余艺术组织，建立固定的、经常的辅导关系，这样一方面从群众的创造吸取营养，一方面切实帮助与指导广大群众的文化生活与他们艺术创造的活动。
    要加强文工团，首先必须加强各级政府文化主管机关对文工团的重视与领导。各级政府的文化主管机关，应当定期讨论文工团的工作，具体规定所属文工团在每个时期的工作任务，特别是规定文工团的创作演出计划与学习计划，并检查其执行程度。文工团向来是培养艺术干部的一种学校；今后应当建立与加强文工团员的学习制度，提高他们的政治与艺术修养的水平，以便在实际工作锻炼中，逐渐培养出大批的优秀演员、导演、音乐、舞蹈及其他艺术人材。文工团的工作是紧张的，许多文工团员又曾长期地在艰苦条件下工作；领导方面应当十分注意保护他们的健康，尤其要注意保护他们表演所必需的体力与歌喉。各专门艺术学校，应当把调训文工团的在职干部、指导与协助文工团的业余学习，当做重要的任务。由于创作是文工团的灵魂，领导方面应采取有效步骤，加强对创作的领导，有计划地组织创作，集中地使用创作力量，以克服过去创作上力量分散，缺乏集中领导的自流状态。
    文工团在毛主席文艺方针领导之下，已获得了初步成果，他们前面摆着十分艰巨的任务，因此丝毫不能自满。今后应当发扬自己的优良传统，进一步和群众相结合，为坚决贯彻毛主席的文艺方针，为大力发展人民的新歌剧、新话剧、新音乐、新舞蹈而努力奋斗。
