Construction is Impossible Without Proper Engineering Design!
	Taiyuan and Shanxi Construction Companies Design Carelessly and Construct Arbitrarily
	Jinan Flour Mill's Construction Project Repeatedly Abandoned and Reworked

The factory buildings and other projects of the Jinan Flour Mill in Shanxi, which were designed by the Taiyuan Construction Company and built by the Shanxi Construction Company last year, have caused serious waste due to crude and impractical designs, resulting in several abandonments and reworks.

The Taiyuan Construction Company, responsible for designing the mill's construction project, blindly formulated designs without surveying the suitability of the foundation. As a result, the Shanxi Construction Company discovered mud and water only 60 centimeters into the ground when building a Class B warehouse. Similarly, the originally designed Class B dormitory for employees also encountered mud and water less than 40 centimeters into the ground. At the same time, because the location of the above buildings hindered the laying of railway tracks within the factory, all construction had to be abandoned, and a large number of waste bricks and tiles accumulated in the factory had to be cleared again for new construction. However, during the second construction phase, the Shanxi Construction Company neglected supervision, resulting in poor overall project quality, with cracks soon appearing in doors and windows, walls tilting, and parts of the project requiring rework or repair.

This year, the design of the five-story flour milling building was delayed for too long, causing investment funds to become stagnant and insufficient to complete the original project plan, forcing the reduction of certain projects. The design drawings for this five-story building were too simplistic and were not followed during the actual construction. Therefore, when the first floor of the building was constructed, it was demolished and rebuilt due to non-compliance with specifications, wasting labor and materials equivalent to 38,000 catties of millet. During the construction of the second floor, construction was halted for a month due to insufficient supply of timber or the unavailability of timber meeting the required specifications. This greatly delayed the commencement plan of the Jinan Flour Mill.

The construction of the Jinan Flour Mill is a relatively large-scale project in Shanxi. However, the Taiyuan Construction Company and the Shanxi Construction Company only relied on subjective estimations and judgments, and crude designs before proceeding with construction, resulting in the disastrous consequences of wasting manpower and financial resources.

　　没有正确的工程设计就不可能施工！
    太原、山西两建筑公司设计潦草随便施工
    晋南面粉厂修建工程一再弃工、返工
    山西晋南面粉厂去年委托太原建筑公司设计、由山西建筑公司修建的厂房等项工程，因设计粗糙和不切合实际，造成了数次弃工、返工的严重浪费。
    太原建筑公司负责设计该厂修建工程，没有勘测地基是否适用，就盲目制定图案，使山西建筑公司修筑乙种仓库时，挖掘地面六十公分就发现泥水；原设计的乙种职工宿舍，挖掘不足四十公分也发现泥水。同时，又因上述建筑物地点有碍厂内铺设铁轨，只得全部被迫弃工，重新清除厂内堆积的大批废砖瓦砾，另行施工。但在第二次施工时，山西建筑公司又因疏于监工，致整个工程质量低劣，门窗不久即呈裂痕，墙壁倾斜，部分工程又得返工或补修。
    今年，该厂的五层制粉大楼，因设计时日拖延太长，致使投资资金死滞，不足完成原定工程计划，只得减缩某些工程。这个五层大楼的设计图表是过于简略的，在具体施工时，也没照这设计进行。所以在筑成该楼的第一层楼时，因不合规格，全部拆除重新修建，约浪费工料费折合小米三万八千斤。建筑至第二层楼时，因木料的供应不足或有木料而规格不合，致停工待料一个月的时间。这就使晋南面粉厂的开工计划拖延了很久。
    晋南面粉厂的建筑是山西规模较大的一项工程。而太原建筑公司、山西建筑公司却只凭主观上的估计判断、粗枝大叶的设计即行施工，致造成损失人力财力的恶果。
