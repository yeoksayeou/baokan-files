Xinhua News Agency, July 15th: US and British soldiers on the Korean battlefield are increasingly weary of the war, and they all hope for an early end to the fighting. According to a TASS dispatch from Moscow on the 14th, *Pravda* published a dispatch from Dechengke in Pyongyang stating that the number of enemy soldiers surrendering voluntarily has greatly increased in recent months. For example, in May and the first half of June this year, more than 300 American and British soldiers surrendered to the Korean People's Army in a certain area of the Western Front alone. As the battlefield situation became increasingly unfavorable, troops of the Li Seung-man army surrendered in entire platoons or even companies.

According to one prisoner, a group of American soldiers protested against being transferred to the Korean front, and the Ridgway headquarters carried out brutal bloody suppression. Dozens of American soldiers were shot, and many more were imprisoned or sent to the Korean front to redeem their "crimes" with blood.

Dechengke said: We have spoken with many prisoners of war, such as British soldier Desmond, American soldier Lino, and Turkish soldier Harimete, who came from various battlefields in Korea, all of whom opposed the continued US and British intervention in Korea.

Sergeant Motes, of "M" Company, 19th Regiment, 24th Infantry Division of the US Army, said: We are all tired of war, and no one does not feel that this war is meaningless. After a year of war, we are increasingly convinced that it is wrong for us to destroy and burn peaceful Korean cities and villages and massacre innocent Korean people.

British soldier Desmond said that since June 23 this year, what the Soviet representative to the United Nations, Malik, said has become the most popular thing in his company, that a peaceful solution to the Korean problem and an end to the bloody Korean War are possible. He said that all British soldiers are eager for this.

Dechengke concluded by saying that the desire of American and British soldiers to stop the intervention in Korea can also be proved by the appeal to the major powers by the prisoners of war published in the latest issue of *New Korea* magazine. In this appeal, they asked the five major powers to conclude a peace treaty as soon as possible.

　　美英士兵厌战益烈
    渴望朝鲜早日停战
    【新华社十五日讯】在朝鲜战场的美、英军士兵厌战情绪日益增长，他们都盼望着早日停止战争。据塔斯社莫斯科十四日讯：《真理报》登载德卡诚科的平壤通讯说：最近数月来，自动投降的敌军士兵大大增加。例如，在今年五月与六月的上半月中，仅在西线某一地区就有三百多名美、英士兵向朝鲜人民军投诚。当战场形势日趋不利的时候，李承晚的部队整排甚至整连地投降。
    据一个俘虏说，一批美国士兵抗议调往朝鲜前线，李奇微总部施行了残酷的血腥镇压。有好几十个美国兵被枪决，还有许多被监禁或派到朝鲜前线以便用血来赎“罪”。
    德卡诚科说：我们曾和许多战俘谈话，例如英国兵狄士蒙德、美国兵黎诺、土耳其兵哈日默特，他们来自朝鲜的各个战场，全都反对美、英在朝鲜继续进行干涉。
    美军步兵第二十四师第十九团“Ｍ”连的中士摩茨说：我们全都厌战，没有一个人不觉得这种战争毫无意义。经过一年的战争，我们日益相信：我们破坏与焚毁朝鲜和平的城市与村庄以及屠杀朝鲜无辜人民，是错误的。
    英国兵狄士蒙德说，从今年六月二十三日起，苏联驻联合国代表马立克所说的话已成了他那一连中最受人欢迎的话，即和平解决朝鲜问题以及停止血腥的朝鲜战争是可能的。他说，所有的英国兵都渴望着这一点。
    德卡诚科最后说，美、英士兵要求停止干涉朝鲜的愿望，从最近一期《新朝鲜》杂志所刊载的战俘们致各大国的呼吁书也可以得到证明。他们在这个呼吁书中要求五大国从速缔结和平公约。
