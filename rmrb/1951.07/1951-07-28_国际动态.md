  The "Achievements" of the Marshall Plan
    Because the Turkish market is flooded with American goods, Turkish industry is rapidly heading towards complete bankruptcy. Unemployment is extremely serious; among Turkey's approximately 19 million people, the number of unemployed reaches 2 million to 4 million. According to the Turkish newspaper "Force," "Three-quarters of the Turkish people cannot make a living. 15 million Turkish people live an unhappy life." These are the "achievements" of the reactionary Turkish government relying on the "Marshall Plan" to solve its serious financial and economic crisis.
  Futile Slander
    While the United States is actively preparing for a separate peace treaty with Japan, Sebald, the political advisor to the US headquarters in Japan, recently instigated the Japanese puppet Prime Minister Yoshida to extensively spread slanderous remarks, propagating that the Soviet and Chinese authorities had abused Japanese prisoners of war who have now returned home, in an attempt to stir up anti-Soviet and anti-Chinese sentiments among the Japanese people and dispel their demands that the peace treaty must include the Soviet Union and China.
    The US-Japanese reactionaries have long been engaged in such slanderous propaganda in Japan, but the Japanese people's response has been to enthusiastically support the just proposals of China and the Soviet Union for a peace treaty with Japan, and firmly oppose the US's plot for a separate peace treaty and the rearmament of Japan. The slanderous propaganda of the US-Japanese reactionaries is nothing but a futile effort!
  The Death of the Old Traitor Pétain
    Pétain, the infamous French traitor who signed the surrender document to Hitler on behalf of the French government during World War II, died of illness on the 23rd in a hospital in exile. The reactionary French government has consistently attempted to reduce Pétain's sentence. After the results of the June 17th general election were revealed, it immediately announced that Pétain's life imprisonment would be reduced to permanent confinement in a hospital.
    Today, those who are selling out France to the United States, such as de Gaulle and Schuman, cannot avoid feeling a sense of "the rabbit mourning the fox's death" at the death of this old traitor!

  马歇尔计划的“成绩”
    由于美国货物充斥土耳其市场，土耳其工业正在迅速走向全面破产。失业现象极为严重，在土耳其约一千九百万人口中，失业人数达二百万至四百万。据土耳其《力报》消息，“土耳其四分之三的人无法糊口。土耳其一千五百万人过着不幸的生活。”这是反动的土耳其政府依靠“马歇尔计划”来解救它严重的财政与经济危机的“成绩”。
  徒劳的诽谤
    在美国积极准备对日单独媾和的时候，美国驻日总部政治顾问赛鲍尔最近主使日本傀儡首相吉田，准备大事散布诽谤言论，宣传苏联和中国当局曾经虐待现在已经回国的日本俘虏，以图鼓动日本人民的反对苏联反对中国的情绪，打消他们主张和约必须有苏联和中国参加的要求。
    美日反动派在日本早就进行着这种诽谤宣传，但是日本人民的回答却是热烈拥护中苏对日媾和的公正主张，坚决反对美国单独媾和、重新武装日本的阴谋。美日反动派的诽谤宣传徒然心劳日拙！
  老卖国贼贝当之死
    在第二次世界大战中代表法国政府向希特勒签降书的著名法奸贝当，已于二十三日病死在流放地的医院中。法国反动政府过去一贯企图为贝当减刑，在六月十七日大选结果揭晓以后，又立即宣布把贝当由无期徒刑减为永久监禁于医院中。
    今天正在把法国出卖给美国的戴高乐与舒曼之流，对于这个老牌卖国贼之死难免不无“兔死狐悲”之感吧！
