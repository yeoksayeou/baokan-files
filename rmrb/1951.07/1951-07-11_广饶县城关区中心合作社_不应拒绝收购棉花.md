　　Guangrao County Chengguan District Central Cooperative
    Should Not Refuse to Purchase Cotton

    It is very wrong for the Chengguan District Central Cooperative in Guangrao County, Shandong Province, not to accept cotton sold by the masses to the state. According to reports from Li Haoxue, Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Branch in Zhujia Township, and Si Huifeng, Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Branch in Sijia Township, both in Chengguan District, several cotton farmers in these two townships sent cotton for sale to the Chengguan District Central Cooperative, but the cooperative refused to accept it and told the farmers to take the cotton back home. It is said that the cooperative's reasons for not accepting cotton were twofold: first, they had not received instructions from higher authorities and could not accept it; second, the quantity of cotton was too small and not worth accepting. This practice fully demonstrates that the cooperative's cadres have neither a sense of the state nor a sense of the masses. I suggest that the cooperative's cadres seriously study the instructions on cotton purchase and storage work issued by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government and the instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and recognize the serious significance of cotton purchase and storage work. Even if the masses sell one or two pounds of cotton, they should be warmly welcomed and should never be refused purchase because of the small quantity.

　　广饶县城关区中心合作社
    不应拒绝收购棉花
    山东广饶县城关区中心合作社，不收群众向国家售出的棉花，这是很不对的。据该县城关区朱家乡中共支部书记李好学及司家乡中共支部书记司惠风报告，该两乡若干棉农把出售的棉花送到城关区中心合作社，但合作社不收，又让农民把棉花带回家去。据谈，该合作社不收棉花的理由有二：一是未接到上级指示，不能收；二是棉花数量太少，不值得收。这种作法，充分表现了该合作社干部既无国家观念，又无群众观念。我建议该合作社干部认真学习中央人民政府政务院公布的关于购棉储棉工作的指示及中共中央的指示，认识购棉、储棉工作的严重意义。那怕是群众售一斤一两棉花，都应该热诚欢迎，决不应因其数量太少而拒绝收购。
