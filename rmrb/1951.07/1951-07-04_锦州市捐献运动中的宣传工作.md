　　Jinzhou City's Propaganda Work in the Donation Movement
    On June 13th, the Jinzhou City branch of the Liaoxi Province Anti-American and Aid Korea Association held a full committee meeting, which determined that propaganda work for the donation movement should be carried out extensively and in depth. The method was to convey the content and spirit of the three appeals of the Anti-American and Aid Korea General Association completely to the masses through various mass organizations and various forms of propaganda. The meeting also suggested that the Communist Party reporters and propagandists in the city immediately begin comprehensive propaganda activities, and at the same time, organize propaganda work brigades to both promote and assist various sectors and units in formulating patriotic production increase and donation plans, which would then be combined to formulate a city-wide donation plan.
    After the meeting, the city's Federation of Trade Unions, Federation of Industry and Commerce, literary and art circles, and the Anti-American and Aid Korea branches in various streets, as well as the Anti-American and Aid Korea representative meetings in the suburbs, held separate meetings to discuss the transmission, propaganda, and formulation of donation plans. Beginning on the 15th, the city's 90 reporters and 1,700 propagandists launched a widespread propaganda campaign to the city's people, focusing on implementing the spirit of increasing production, improving management, and donating weapons to support the front from increased income. The business community also established a donation committee and organized a large number of personnel to conduct propaganda to various industries and businesses, and to help formulate donation plans for strengthening business management, improving urban and rural trade, and increasing business income. On the afternoon of the 18th, a propaganda work brigade composed of 1,200 people went deep into the residential groups in various streets to both promote and assist residential groups in revising patriotic covenants and formulating production increase and donation plans.
    The city's propaganda work first educated everyone with the heroic deeds of the volunteer army in the Korean War and the personal experiences of the masses, in order to further inspire the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses. The propaganda work brigade and street propagandists told the masses some vivid and touching stories from the front lines in Korea (Liaoxi Daily reprinted many Korean communications in succession to cooperate with the province's patriotic propaganda). Some areas also organized local street cadres and experienced people to tell the true stories of the imperialists oppressing, insulting, and killing the Chinese people during the "Eight-Power Allied Forces," the "September 18th Incident," and the War of Resistance Against Japan, in the form of seminars and chats, and then connected them to the current political status and living conditions of the Chinese people. The comparison of these facts educated most of the youth, women, and children, making everyone feel ashamed and hateful of the previous humiliating encounters, and thus associate themselves with the fact that modern Chinese people are truly proud and elated. In this way, the masses' love for the motherland and the emotion of supporting the front were greatly encouraged and inspired.
    Secondly, the propaganda paid attention to correctly explaining the meaning and method of the donation movement, and dispelled the concerns of some of the masses. At the beginning of the donation movement, some of the masses in the city had incorrect views. Some said, "Isn't it just donating money? Wouldn't it be enough to divide up whatever the superiors send down?" Some people also said, "It's enough to donate money, why bother making plans?" Others were afraid of "evaluating family property" and "comparing and competing with each other." Therefore, the propagandists, in response to these ideological problems of the masses, used methods such as giving examples and using metaphors to repeatedly explain the two basic spirits of donating from increased production and increased income and that donation should be entirely based on conscious willingness, so that the masses could understand that this donation could not only support the front and consolidate national defense, but also promote the country's construction and increase the wealth of the masses themselves. In this way, everyone's patriotic enthusiasm was guided to finding ways to increase production and increase income, and the concerns of the masses were eliminated.
    Thirdly, the wisdom of the masses was brought into play, and everyone was mobilized to think of ways, make plans, and revise patriotic covenants. For example, in the fourth residential group of Xiaoling Street in the city, many people felt that they could not find a way to increase production before making a production increase and donation plan. The propaganda staff convened a meeting of all the residents of the group, calling on everyone to use their brains and think of ways. After mutual inspiration and serious study at the meeting, everyone came up with eighteen better ways to increase income. For example, Yongzengchang Grain and Rice Store planned to sell more kidney beans and small beans and other raw grains that suit the needs of customers, and at the same time, pay attention to sweeping up scattered miscellaneous grains at any time every day. The increased income from these two items is equal to 10% of the store's average net profit. Many housewives have also come up with production methods. At the meeting, the masses also initially planned mutual assistance and cooperation methods for saving manpower and time, such as elderly women who have nothing to do taking care of children for busy people, children taking and delivering work for working people, and the masses jointly organizing small-scale production undertakings. These methods are all practical and feasible. Everyone made plans based on these methods and donated a portion of the increased income. Then, with the assistance of the propaganda staff, the residents of the group elected one male and one female representative, under the leadership of the group leader, to be responsible for: 1. Helping the masses make plans and solve the difficulties and problems in the production of the masses; 2. Regularly understanding the implementation of the plan by the masses and urging its realization; 3. Holding resident meetings every month to check production achievements, commend good models, introduce experience, and mobilize the masses to compete; 4. Handling calculation, custody, payment and other affairs related to donation work. Finally, the propaganda staff also mobilized the masses of the group to discuss and revise the patriotic covenant, and included the main contents of the production increase and donation plan and the specific methods for doing a good job in preferential treatment into the patriotic covenant.
    With the extensive and in-depth development of the propaganda work, the patriotic production increase and donation movement of the people of all strata in Jinzhou City is flourishing. The Jinzhou City Branch of the Anti-American and Aid Korea Association has convened a full congress of representatives, and based on the situation of the donation movement of people from all walks of life, has tentatively determined to donate five airplanes, including three airplanes donated by the business community and one airplane each from the "Jinzhou Workers" and "Jinzhou Citizens."

　　锦州市捐献运动中的宣传工作
    六月十三日，辽西省锦州市抗美援朝分会召开了全体委员会议，确定了广泛深入开展捐献运动的宣传工作，办法是通过各种群众团体，运用各种宣传形式，把抗美援朝总会三项号召的内容和精神，完整地传达给群众。会议并建议该市中共的报告员和宣传员，立即开始全面的宣传活动，同时组织宣传工作大队，一面宣传，一面协助各界、各单位订出爱国增产捐献计划，然后集中起来再订全市的捐献计划。
    会后，该市总工会、工商联合会、曲艺界和各街道抗美援朝支会、郊区抗美援朝代表会等，都分别召开了会议，讨论了传达、宣传和制订捐献计划等事宜。十五日开始，全市九十名报告员和一千七百名宣传员，即广泛地向全市人民展开了宣传工作，着重贯彻增加生产、改善经营、从增加收入中来捐献武器支援前线的精神。工商界并成立了捐献委员会，组织了大批人力，向各行业、各工商户进行宣传，并帮助订立加强经营管理、作好城乡贸易、增加营业收入的捐献计划。十八日下午，由一千二百人组成的宣传工作大队，深入到各街道居民小组，一面宣传，一面帮助居民小组修订爱国公约，订立增产捐献计划。
    该市的宣传工作，首先是以志愿军在朝鲜作战的英勇事绩和群众所亲历的切身经验来教育大家，进一步启发群众的爱国热情。宣传工作大队和街道宣传队员向群众讲述了一些朝鲜战地通讯中的生动感人的事例（辽西日报为配合该省的爱国宣传，连续转载了朝鲜通讯多篇）。有的地区还组织当地街道干部和经历较多的群众，以座谈会、漫谈等形式，讲述亲身经历的“八国联军”、“九一八”和抗日战争时期帝国主义者欺压、侮辱、杀害中国人民的实事，然后联系到中国人民现在的政治地位和生活情况。这些事实的对比，教育了大部分青年、妇女、儿童，使大家感到以前屈辱遭遇的可耻可恨，从而联想到身为现代中国人真是扬眉吐气了。这样，就大大地鼓舞、激砺了群众的热爱祖国与支援前线的情绪。
    其次，宣传中注意正确地解释捐献运动的意义和方法，解除了部分群众的顾虑。在捐献运动开始时，该市部分群众有不正确的看法。有的说：“不就是捐钱吗？看上边派下来多少大家一分派不就得了吗？”也有人说：“出钱就得了，还订计划干啥？”还有人怕“估家当”、“互比互攀”等。因此，宣传人员就针对群众的这些思想问题，用举例、打比喻等办法，反复解说从提高生产，增加收入中捐献和捐献要完全出乎自觉自愿这两个基本精神，使群众了解到这次捐献不仅可以支援前线，巩固国防，而且可以推动国家的建设事业，增加群众自己的财富。这样就把大家的爱国热情引导到想办法增加生产、增加收入上去，并消除了群众的顾虑。
    第三，发挥群众智慧，发动大家想办法、订计划，修订爱国公约。例如该市小凌街第四居民小组，在订立增产捐献计划前，许多人感到找不到增产的门路。宣传工作人员就召开了该组的全体居民会议，号召大家动脑筋，想办法。经过会上群众的相互启发和认真钻研，大家想出来的较好的增加收入的办法就有十八种。例如，永增长粮米店，计划增卖芸豆、小豆等适合顾主需要的原粮，同时每天注意随时扫拾散落的杂粮，这两项增加的收入，就等于该店平均纯利的百分之十。许多家庭妇女也想出了生产办法。会上群众并初步计划了节省人力，时间的互助合作办法，如没事的老太太给工作忙的人看孩子，儿童给做工的人取活送活，群众合伙组织小型的生产事业等。这些办法都是切实可行的。大家就根据这些办法，订出了计划，捐献增加收入的一部分。接着，该组居民又在宣传工作人员的协助下，推选了男女代表各一人，在组长领导下，负责：一、帮助群众、订计划，解决群众生产当中的困难和问题；二、经常了解群众执行计划的情况，督促其实现；三、每月召开居民会，检查增产成绩，表扬好的典型，介绍经验，发动群众比赛；四、办理捐献方面的计算、保管、缴纳等事务工作。最后，宣传工作人员并发动该组群众讨论修订了爱国公约，把增产捐献计划的主要内容和做好优抚工作的具体办法列入了爱国公约。
    随着宣传工作的广泛深入开展，锦州市各阶层人民的爱国增产捐献运动蓬勃展开了。该市抗美援朝分会已召开全体代表大会，根据各界人民捐献运动的情况，初步确定了捐献飞机五架，包括工商界捐献的三架和“锦州职工号”，“锦州市民号”各一架。
