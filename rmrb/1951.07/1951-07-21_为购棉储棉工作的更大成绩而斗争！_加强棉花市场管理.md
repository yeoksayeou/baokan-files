Strive for Greater Achievements in Cotton Purchasing and Storage!
　　Strengthen Cotton Market Management

　　The Phenomenon of Cotton Market Prices Being Higher Than List Prices is Unreasonable
　　The phenomenon of cotton market prices being higher than list prices has been widespread in various cotton-producing areas, and continues to exist in many regions to this day.
　　The existence of unreasonable market prices in cotton-producing areas has seriously affected the state's cotton purchasing efforts. In the business areas of the branches affiliated to the Baoding Branch of the Hebei Cotton, Yarn & Cloth Company, speculation by peddlers caused market chaos, reducing the company's purchase volume to 60-70% of the market supply. In the Mancheng market, the company's purchase volume was reduced to 30% of the market supply. The Shijiazhuang Cotton, Yarn & Cloth Company's cotton purchase volume accounted for 80% of the market supply last year, but when list prices and market prices diverged in May this year, it decreased to 40%. In Cheng'an County, Hebei, in May this year, peddlers not only rushed to buy in the market, but also intercepted purchases at intersections, encouraging cotton farmers to hoard and wait for prices to rise, which gradually reduced market supply and reduced the company's purchase volume accordingly.
　　Two Opinions on Handling the Price Difference Problem
　　How should the problem of cotton market prices being higher than list prices be handled? There are two different opinions: One opinion believes that the current list price of state-owned trading companies is reasonable and guarantees the interests of cotton farmers. In order to eliminate the phenomenon of list prices diverging from market prices, maintain market stability, and facilitate government cotton purchasing and farmer cotton sales, the market should be strictly managed, and merchants and peddlers should be managed. Another opinion believes that managing the market will hinder the exchange of goods and violate the policy of free trade, so list prices should be adjusted to market prices. The Industry and Commerce Section of Ningjin County, Shandong, once relaxed its management of the market due to one-sidedly emphasizing the "free trade policy." The Industry and Commerce Section of the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Commissioner's Office also held the same view in the past. Some cadres in Pingyuan and other places echoed the masses in shouting that "list prices are too low." Cadres of the Industry and Commerce Section of Wuqiao County, Shandong, saw that private merchants were offering higher prices in the market, and said to the cadres of the cooperatives: "Private peddlers can offer high prices, why can't you offer high prices?" Shandong, Henan and other provinces once used material rewards to increase prices in disguise, keeping pace with market prices.
　　Does Market Management Violate the Free Trade Policy?
　　Which opinion is correct? It should be affirmed that the former is correct. Managing the market is one of the main tasks of government industry and commerce departments, a necessary measure to keep social production and commerce on the right track, and an important step for the state to lead private merchants. Failure to manage the market will allow the activities of private merchants and peddlers in the market to go beyond the scope of legitimate business, hindering the progress of national economic construction. A private merchant in Wenxiang, Henan, used a cotton-wheat price ratio of 1:15 to purchase one jin of lint cotton in the market; as soon as the news spread, the local state cotton purchasing work was immediately seriously affected. A serious incident was discovered in Handan in which cotton merchants evaded more than 10 million yuan in taxes in ten days. Other places have also discovered illegal acts by private merchants such as adding water and adulterating cotton. In order to stabilize the market, maintain reasonable price ratios for various commodities, and guarantee reasonable income for farmers, it is entirely necessary for the government to manage the market and strictly restrict or even ban activities that disrupt the market. Article 37 of the Common Program stipulates: "Protect all legal public and private trade. ...Implement freedom of domestic trade within the unified national economic plan, but speculative commerce that disrupts the market must be strictly prohibited." Some cadres regard the government's management of the market and the ban on illegal merchants as "violating the free trade policy," which in fact means abandoning the state's leadership over private commerce and allowing speculators to do whatever they want. The consequences of doing so are very bad.
　　Does Market Management Hinder the Exchange of Goods?
　　Does managing the market and banning illegal merchants hinder the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas? Facts have proved that not only does it not hinder it, but it can promote the acceleration of the exchange of goods. In the past, due to private merchants transporting goods randomly in various places and pursuing excessive profits, cotton areas in Hebei and Pingyuan provinces and the triangular area of ​​Hebei, Pingyuan and Shandong provinces experienced the phenomenon of cotton flowing backwards and chaotically. Cotton in southern Shanxi also flowed to the cotton-producing areas around Lingbao, Henan. These phenomena have disrupted the law of material circulation, causing cotton that should have been transported from rural areas to cities to circle greatly in rural areas. This violates the meaning of exchanging goods between urban and rural areas and should never be advocated. On the contrary, through the purchases of state-owned trading organizations and cooperatives, cotton can be normally and quickly supplied to the textile industry from the hands of producers. This is beneficial to both cotton producers and the textile industry.
　　Can Cotton Be Purchased by Following Market Prices?
　　Some cadres thought that as long as they paid more money, they could buy cotton, and advocated following market prices. Facts have also proved that this cannot solve the problem because this approach stimulates farmers' expectations of rising prices, making them even more reluctant to sell. Private merchants can continue to raise prices and purchase cotton through tactics such as adding water and adulterating, and evading taxes, making cotton prices even more chaotic. The experience of Henan and other provinces has already proved this.
　　The Role of Market Management in Cotton Purchasing
　　What is the role of market management in cotton purchasing? There are many facts to illustrate this. After the industry and commerce departments of Qiu County, Hebei, strengthened market management, implemented joint purchasing, and eliminated the phenomenon of list prices diverging from market prices, the daily market supply of cotton gradually increased. In early June, the daily market supply was 4,000-5,000 jin, and by late June, it had increased to 40,000-50,000 jin. After the Shijiazhuang area strengthened market management in June and strengthened mass propaganda and education, the purchase volume increased by 95% compared with May. Before the implementation of market management, the Dianshang Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Cheng'an County collected more than 1,000 jin of seed cotton every day. On the second day after implementing market management and strictly inspecting merchants, it collected more than 11,000 jin of seed cotton. Similar situations exist in other regions.
　　How to Manage the Market?
　　Based on the experience of several regions in Hebei Province, the main methods of market management are reviewing and registering merchants and implementing joint purchasing. When adopting this method, a cotton purchasing committee can be formed by the local people's government, tax bureau, cotton, yarn and cloth company, market committee, and representatives of merchants and cotton farmers, with groups set up for grading and pricing, weighing, bookkeeping, payment, publicity, registering cotton merchants, and checking licenses. Purchases are made at a unified price, and cotton is distributed after the daily market closure according to the proportion of public and private investment or the distribution ratio agreed upon through consultation.
　　Patriotic Education Should Be Conducted for Cotton Merchants and Peddlers
　　When adopting these methods, patriotic education should be conducted for cotton merchants and peddlers to make them consciously abide by various regulations. When implementing market management, various counties in the Shijiazhuang area universally convened symposiums for merchants in various markets to make merchants understand the political significance of the government's cotton purchasing and storage and the government's market management policy. In the process of managing the market, Gaotang County, Pingyuan, convened a county-wide meeting of merchants. Cotton merchants signed a patriotic pact at the meeting, guaranteeing not to rush to buy cotton; to sell whatever they bought to the state; and to guarantee no adding water or adulterating.
　　Help Some Cotton Merchants and Peddlers Change Careers
　　As a result of implementing market management and joint purchasing, some merchants and peddlers will temporarily lose their jobs, and the government should provide appropriate assistance. The main methods for solving this problem in various parts of Hebei are to let merchants purchase on behalf of the state, or temporarily serve as state employees. Some can be organized to change careers. In Yuanshi County, Hebei, 45 peddler households have already changed to production or salt peddling industries with the help of the local government. In Weibo Town, Shulu County, more than 40 peddler households have also switched to purchasing local products for the local native products company. In the process of managing the market, the Nangong County government not only helped cotton merchants change careers, but also absorbed 36 cotton merchants who had temporary difficulties in changing careers to do processing work for the Cotton, Yarn & Cloth Company. In some areas, after the implementation of market management, merchants saw that the company's cotton purchasing grades were strict, and they could no longer add water or adulterate. At the same time, because the regional price difference was reduced, it was impossible to seize high profits through transportation and sales between cotton areas, so they successively changed careers on their own. The number of cotton merchants in Mancheng Market has decreased from the original 20-30 to 4-5 after the implementation of market management.
　　Market Management Work Should Be Regularized and Implemented Comprehensively
　　The work of reviewing and registering merchants and implementing joint purchasing should be regularized, and should not be intermittent, sometimes tight and sometimes loose, in order to maintain the effectiveness of management. It has been noted that black markets were discovered in Xinji, Shijiazhuang and other places when market management was slightly relaxed.
　　At the same time, the management of the cotton market should be comprehensively implemented in all cotton-producing areas and cities and towns adjacent to cotton-producing areas. If area A is managed and area B is not managed, a black market may occur in area A, causing cotton to flow chaotically.
　　Accurately Grasp the Grade and Quality of Cotton
　　While managing the cotton market, the grade and quality of cotton should also be accurately grasped. The inconsistent classification of cotton grades and qualities by various purchasing departments has created opportunities for merchants to exploit loopholes. In June, cotton merchants bought cotton from southern Shanxi and transported it for sale south of the Yellow River, partly because of regional price differences, and partly because the grades in Lingbao, Henan were higher. Therefore, accurately grasping grades and quality is very important.

　　为购棉储棉工作的更大成绩而斗争！
　  加强棉花市场管理

  棉花市价高于牌价的现象是不合理的
    棉花市价高于牌价的现象在各棉产区曾普遍存在，许多地区直到目前仍继续存在。
    棉产区市场上不合理的市价的存在，曾经严重地影响了国家购棉工作的进行。花纱布公司河北保定分公司所属支公司业务区域各市场，曾因小贩抬价争购，市场混乱，使公司的收购数量缩减到上市量的百分之六、七十。满城市场上公司的收购量缩减到上市量的百分之三十。石家庄花纱布公司去年收棉量占上市量百分之八十，今年五月牌价市价脱节时，降低为百分之四十。河北成安县今年五月间，小贩们不仅在市场上抢购，并且到路口截购，助长了棉农惜售等涨的心理，使上市量日渐缩减，公司的收购量也随之减少。
  对于差价问题的两种处理意见
    如何处理棉花市价高于牌价的问题呢？有两种不同的意见：一种意见认为：现在国营贸易公司的牌价就是合理的，保证了棉农利益的。为了消灭市价与牌价脱节的现象，保持市场平稳，便利政府购棉和农民售棉，应该严格管理市场，管理商贩。另一种意见认为：管理市场会妨碍物资交流，并且违反自由贸易的政策，因此应该以牌价适应市价。山东宁津县的工商科即曾因片面强调“贸易自由政策”而放松对市场的管理。石家庄专署工商科过去也曾有过同一观点。平原等地有的干部跟着群众喊“牌价低”。山东吴桥县工商科干部在市场上看见私商出的价钱大，便对合作社的干部说：“人家小贩能出大价，你们就不能出大价？”山东、河南等省曾一度用物质奖励的办法变相加价，向市价看齐。
  管理市场违反贸易自由政策吗？
    那种意见是正确的呢？应该肯定，前者是正确的。管理市场是政府工商部门的主要任务之一，是使社会生产事业和商业沿着正当轨道前进的必要措施之一，也是国家领导私商的重要步骤之一。对市场不加管理，便会使私商小贩在市场上的活动越出正当经营的范围，妨碍国家经济建设的进展。河南阌乡有一个私商，用一比十五的棉麦比价在市场收购皮棉一斤；消息一传出去，当地的国家购棉工作马上受到重大影响。邯郸曾发现棉商在十天中偷漏税款一千多万元的严重事件。其他各地也都发现私商在棉花中使水、搀杂等违法的行为。政府为了稳定市场，保持各种物品的合理比价，保证农民合理的收益，对市场加以管理，对于扰乱市场的行为，加以严格的限制以至取缔，是完全必要的。共同纲领第三十七条规定：“保护一切合法的公私贸易。……在国家统一的经济计划内实行国内贸易的自由，但对于扰乱市场的投机商业必须严格取缔。”有些干部把政府管理市场和取缔非法商贩看做“违反贸易自由政策”，实际上就是要放弃国家对私营商业的领导，一任投机商人为所欲为。这样做去，其后果是很坏的。
  管理市场妨碍物资交流吗？
    管理市场、取缔非法商贩是不是妨碍城乡物资交流呢？事实证明，不仅不妨碍，反而可以促使物资交流加速。过去由于私商在各地来往乱运，追逐超额利润，河北、平原等省棉区和河北、平原、山东三角地区曾发生棉花倒流、乱流现象。山西南部的棉花，也有流向河南灵宝一带产棉区的现象。这些现象，破坏了物资流转的规律，使应该由农村运到城市的棉花，在农村中大兜圈子。这是违反交流城乡物资的意义的，决不应该提倡。相反地，通过国营贸易机构和合作社的收购，棉花则可以由生产者的手里正常地迅速地供应给纺织工业。这对棉花的生产者和纺织工业都有利。
  跟着市价跑就能买到棉花吗？
    有些干部以为只要多掏钱就能买到棉花，主张跟随市价跑。事实也已证明这是不能解决问题的。因为这种作法刺激农民看涨心理，使农民更加惜售。私商则能以掺水掺假、漏税等伎俩，继续提价收购，使棉价更加混乱。河南等省的经验已经证明。
  管理市场对购棉工作的作用
    管理市场对购棉工作的作用怎样呢？这有很多事实可以说明。河北邱县工商部门在加强对市场的管理、实行联购、消灭了牌、市价脱节的现象之后，棉花每日上市量逐渐增加。六月上旬每日上市四、五千斤，至六月下旬增到四、五万斤。石家庄专区在六月份加强市场管理后，并加强了群众宣传教育工作，收购量较五月份增加了百分之九十五。成安县店上供销社在实行市场管理前每天收籽棉一千多斤，在实施市场管理、严加检查商贩的次日，即收进籽棉一万一千多斤。其他地区也有类似情况。
  怎样管理市场？
    综合河北省若干地区的经验，管理市场的主要方法是审查登记商贩，实行联购。在采用这种办法时，可由当地人民政府、税务局、花纱布公司、集市委员会和商贩、棉农代表等组成购棉委员会，下设分级定价、过秤、记账、付款、宣传、登记棉贩、检查牌照等组。在统一的价格下进行收购，每日收市后按公私投资比例或经过协商而规定的分配比例分配棉花。
  要对棉商小贩进行爱国主义教育
    在采用这些办法时，应该对棉商小贩进行爱国主义的教育，使他们自觉地遵守各种规定。石家庄专区各县在实行市场管理时，普遍召开了各集市商贩座谈会，使商贩了解政府购棉储棉的政治意义和政府管理市场的方针。平原高唐县在管理市场中，召开了全县规模的商贩会议，棉花商贩在会上订了爱国公约，保证不抢购；买了一定卖给国家；保证不掺水、掺杂。
  要帮助部分棉花商贩转业
    实行管理市场和联购的结果，部分商贩会因此暂时失业，政府应该适当加以帮助。河北各地解决这一问题的办法，主要是让商贩为国家代购，或暂作国家的雇员。有的可以组织转业。河北元氏县有四十五户小贩，已经在当地政府帮助下转入生产或贩盐等行业。束鹿县位伯镇也有四十余户小贩转向为当地土产公司收购土产。南宫县政府在管理市场中除帮助棉贩转业外，并吸收了一时转业困难的三十六户棉贩为花纱布公司做加工活。有的地区在实行市场管理后，商贩见公司收棉品级严格，自己再想掺杂使水已不可能，同时由于地区差价缩小，也不可能在棉区之间通过运销攫取高利，也就相继自行转业。满城集市上原有棉贩二、三十人，实行市场管理后已减少至四、五人。
        市场管理工作要经常化并全面实行
    审查登记商贩和实行联购的工作应该经常化，不能时有时无，忽紧忽松，以保持管理的成效。辛集、石家庄等地，在管理市场稍显松弛时，即发现黑市，这现象值得注意。
    同时，管理棉花市场应该在各产棉区和邻近产棉区的城市、集镇全面实行。甲地管理，乙地不管理，则甲地可能发生黑市，引起棉花乱流。
  要准确地掌握棉花的等级和品质
    在管理棉花市场的同时，并应准确地掌握棉花的等级、品质。各收购部门对棉花的等级、品质的划分不一致，给商贩制造了钻空子的机会。六月间棉贩从晋南买棉花运到黄河以南出售，一方面是因为存在着地区差价，另一方面也是因为河南灵宝一带评级较高。所以，准确掌握等级和品质是非常重要的。
