　　Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China
    ——Written in Commemoration of the Thirtieth Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China
    Chen Qiyou
    Under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, we have already overthrown the two great mountains of feudalism, which had weighed on the heads of 500 million people for thousands of years, and imperialism, which had weighed on them for over a hundred years. Overthrowing such heavy mountains is no easy task; one might even say it was unimaginable. Simply considering this fact, our commemoration of the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China fills us with unspeakable joy and excitement, to the point of not knowing how to commemorate it in a way that truly expresses our gratitude and celebration.
    The modern Chinese revolution began over a hundred years ago, with the stamp of the jackboots of capitalist imperialism on our sacred soil. For over a hundred years, before the founding of the Communist Party, our predecessors engaged in revolution using various methods and shed the blood and sweat of countless people. Yet they all failed. Only after the birth of the Communist Party of China thirty years ago today did our revolution begin to embark on the correct path, gaining the possibility of achieving such unprecedented victories as we see today.
    Why does the Communist Party possess such power? The most fundamental reason is that it possesses the ideological weapons of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Marxism-Leninism is a scientific truth "applicable to all corners of the world," and Mao Zedong Thought is the result of Chairman Mao combining the practice of the Chinese revolution with this truth. Moreover, Chairman Mao's creativity further developed and amplified Marxism-Leninism, making it the sharpest weapon for humanity, especially in the East, to liberate itself. Without this weapon, it is impossible for humanity to achieve true liberation.
    However, speaking of Marxism-Leninism and its integration with the actual conditions of the Chinese revolution is not as easy as writing the words. Without the wholehearted, selfless dedication to serving the people by the members of the Communist Party, and more importantly, without a great scientist and revolutionary like Chairman Mao as the leader of the Party and the people, Marxism-Leninism could not have played such a great role in the Chinese revolution.
    In the thirty years that the Communist Party has led us to complete victory, it has experienced and created countless unprecedented events, unlike anything in Chinese history or even in world history (such as the 25,000-li Long March). These events prove that the Communist Party of China, with the ideological weapons of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and possessing the steel-like qualities of its members, is invincible. At the same time, as we commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of its founding, we should especially remember that countless heads of revolutionary martyrs were sacrificed to create our happiness. When we drink water, we should remember its source. We should be doubly grateful to the Communist Party and revere it.
    Today, the great enemy of the Chinese people, imperialism, is still using every method and every means to harm our beloved motherland. To safeguard the victory of the New Democracy and our happy lives, we still need to wage a life-and-death struggle against the imperialist aggressors led by the United States. This struggle is undoubtedly the last struggle of humanity, and therefore will be the most brutal. But as long as we sincerely follow Chairman Mao and the Communist Party forward, final victory will surely be ours.
    Long live the Communist Party of China!
    Long live Chairman Mao, the greatest leader of the Chinese people!

### 没有共产党没有新中国——为纪念中国共产党建党三十周年而作

　　没有共产党没有新中国
    ——为纪念中国共产党建党三十周年而作
    陈其尤
    在伟大的中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导之下，我们已经把压在五万万人民头上几千年的封建主义和一百余年的帝国主义这两座大山推翻了。推翻这样沉重的两座大山，不是容易的事，甚至可以说不敢想像的事。只要想一想这事实，我们对于中国共产党建党三十年的纪念，就会有说不出的欢欣与兴奋，甚至不知道应当以怎样的方式来纪念它，才能表示我们对于它的感激与庆祝。
    中国人民近代的革命，是从一百余年前资本帝国主义的兽蹄踏上我们神圣的国土就开始的。一百余年来，在共产党未成立以前，我们的先辈，曾经以各种各样的方法进行过革命，也流了不知多少人的血汗。然而他们都失败了。只有到了三十年前的今天，中国共产党诞生后，我们的革命才开始走上了正确的道路，才具有得到像今天这样空前胜利的可能。
    共产党何以有这样的力量呢？最基本的原因就是它有了马克思、列宁主义和毛泽东思想这一个思想武器。马克思、列宁主义是“放之四海而皆准”的科学真理，毛泽东思想则是毛泽东主席以中国革命的实践与这个真理相结合所产生的结果。不过毛主席的创造力，更发扬光大了马克思、列宁主义，使它成为人类，特别在东方，解放自己的最犀利的武器。没有这个武器，人类要得到真正的解放是不可能的。
    然而，谈马克思、列宁主义和与中国革命的实际相结合，并不是像我们用文字来写这句话那样容易的。如果没有中国共产党党员们全心全意大公无私为人民服务的奋斗精神，更重要的是，如果没有像毛主席这样伟大的科学家和革命家作为党与人民的领袖，马克思、列宁主义是不可能在中国革命中起这样伟大的作用的。
    共产党在领导我们得到彻底胜利的三十年中，经历了和创造了无数史无前例的大事，不仅在中国的历史上没有过。甚至在世界历史上也没有过（譬如二万五千里的长征）。这些大事，证明了具有马克思、列宁主义和毛泽东思想的思想武器和拥有像钢铁一样坚强品质的党员的中国共产党，是所向无敌的。同时，在纪念它的建立三十周年的时候，我们尤应当想到是先烈们牺牲了无数的头颅，才造成我们的幸福。饮水思源，我们应当加倍的感激共产党，崇敬共产党。
    今天，中国人民的大敌，帝国主义还在以一切方法从一切方面来危害我们可爱的祖国。我们要保障新民主主义的胜利与幸福的生活，还需要和以美国为首的帝国主义侵略者作殊死的斗争。这个斗争无疑地是人类中最后的斗争，因此，将是最残酷的斗争。但是只要我们诚心诚意跟着毛主席与共产党前进，最后胜利一定是我们的。
    中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民最伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
