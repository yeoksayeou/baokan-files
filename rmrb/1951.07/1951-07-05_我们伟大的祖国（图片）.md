    Our Great Motherland
    It is currently the peak season for fish production. With the active support of the local people's government, fishermen in East China have achieved a harvest this year that has not been seen for many years. Fishermen in Shanbeitou, Muping, Yantai, Shandong, caught a large number of premium croakers from the sea, each weighing more than six catties. Here, cooperative members and other buyers are gathering around, and everyone is saying, "The land has a good harvest, and the water also has a good harvest."

    目前正是产鱼的旺季，华东渔民在当地人民政府的积极扶持下，今年得到了多年来所没有的丰收。山东烟台牟平山北头一带的渔民，从海口捕到的大批加级鱼，每头重达六斤以上。在这里，合作社人员和其他购买者都围拢来了，大家都说：“地里丰收，水里也丰收了。”
