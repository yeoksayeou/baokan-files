The East China Meeting on Handling American-Subsidized Relief Organizations was held in Shanghai for seven days, from the 14th to the 21st of last month. At the meeting, representatives from many relief organizations that accepted American subsidies denounced the crimes of imperialist elements who harmed Chinese children under the guise of "relief." Li Guijin, an orphan who lived in the Shanghai Sacred Heart Infant Asylum for eighteen years, accused the organization: One summer, more than one hundred infants died in the orphanage in a single day. Zhou Yueying of the Jinan Taishan Nursing Home accused: We orphans ate chaff and locust leaves, and drank cold water in all seasons. Older children were forced to knit two dozen socks every day; if they couldn't, they would be starved by the foreign nuns. Those foreign nuns often beat us with whips and iron rods, and sometimes forced us to eat feces and flies. The foreign nuns said, "This is God's punishment." Shi Zhaiyun, a deaf-mute girl from the Nanjing School for the Blind and Deaf, used gestures to accuse (translated by another person) that she had been drugged and raped by Wu Xingya, a henchman of the imperialist elements in the school. She sobbed during her accusation, but when she spoke of how the People's Government had taken charge for her and arrested Wu Xingya, she expressed deep gratitude. She raised her hand and tried her best to utter the barely discernible sounds: "Down with American imperialism!" "Long live the Communist Party!"

After the accusations and group discussions, all representatives unanimously supported the "Implementation Measures for Handling American-Subsidized Relief Societies and Relief Organizations," and expressed their determination to sever all ties with American imperialism and run their own welfare and relief undertakings for the Chinese people. They also passed a resolution demanding that the People's Government severely punish Libri, the imperialist element who actually controlled Catholic orphanages in various places.

　　华东处理接受美国津贴救济机关会议
    决议要求政府严惩黎培里
    华东区处理接受美国津贴救济机关会议从上月十四日到廿一日在上海开了七天会。会上有许多接受美国津贴的救济机关的代表控诉了帝国主义分子在“救济”名义下残害我国儿童的罪行。在上海圣母院育婴堂住了十八年的孤女李桂金控诉说：有一个夏天，她所在的育婴堂内一天就死了一百多个婴儿。济南泰山教养院的周月英控诉说：我们孤儿们吃的是糠秕和槐叶，四季喝的都是冷水，年龄大一点的孩子，每天被迫要织好二打袜子；织不出就要被外国修女罚饿。那些外国修女还常用皮鞭、铁棍毒打我们，有时还要罚我们吃粪便和苍蝇。外国修女却说：“这是上帝的责罚”。南京盲哑学校哑女生史斋云用手势控诉（由另一人翻译），她曾被该校帝国主义分子的爪牙吴醒亚用蒙药蒙倒后实行强奸。她在控诉中泣不成声，但当她讲到人民政府已替她作主，逮捕了吴醒亚时，流露出万分感激的心情。她举起手来，竭力地拚出了依稀可辨的声音：“打倒美帝国主义！”“共产党万岁！”
    全体代表在经过控诉并经过小组讨论以后，一致拥护“关于处理接受美国津贴救济社团及救济机关实施办法”，并表示要坚决割断与美帝国主义的一切联系，办好中国人民自己的福利救济事业。他们并且通过了一项决议：要求人民政府严厉惩办实际上控制着各地天主教孤儿院的帝国主义分子黎培里。
