Ruijin, Jiangxi Province, the central Red Army base area during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, its garrison troops and people from all walks of life are enthusiastically preparing to celebrate the "August 1st" Army Day. The county will hold a grand celebration on "August 1st" and review the garrison troops and people's armed forces. The Ruijin County People's Government had long prepared many honorary plaques to be sent to the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers, and it is scheduled to host a banquet for them on August 1st. The People's Government also plans to celebrate the merits of Chen Guisheng's family, a hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, who lives in Helong Township, the county.

The Ruijin County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the County People's Government organized a large number of reporters and propagandists in late July to publicize the history of the Chinese Communist Party leading the people's army in arduous struggle, and the importance of continuing to strengthen national defense construction. Before "August 1st", the People's Governments of all districts and townships held forums for the families of martyrs and soldiers to thoroughly examine the preferential treatment work and solicit their opinions on improving the preferential treatment work. These days, the masses in various townships and villages are holding meetings and discussions, recalling the situation in which the Communist Party led them to carry out armed struggles during the Second Revolutionary Civil War.

A certain unit of the local garrison studied the history of army building in carrying out the hard study and hard training campaign, and organized propaganda teams, yangko teams, and living newspaper teams to publicize the history of army building to the masses. On "August 1st", the garrison also plans to hold a "military-civilian friendship sports meeting" and theatrical performances.

The people of Yeping Village, Ruijin County, where the central democratic government was located during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, are actively rebuilding the "Red Army Martyrs Memorial Tower" in order to welcome the "August 1st" Army Day, striving for early completion.

　　瑞金军民迎接“八一”大力宣传建军史检查优抚工作
    第二次国内革命战争时期中央红军根据地——江西省瑞金县的驻军和各界人民，正热烈筹备庆祝“八一”建军节。该县将在“八一”那天举行盛大庆祝会，并检阅驻军和人民武装。瑞金县人民政府早就做了很多光荣牌，准备送给革命烈士家属和革命军人家属，并订于八月一日设宴招待他们。人民政府还准备给住在该县合龙乡的中国人民志愿军功臣陈桂生的家属庆功。
    中共瑞金县委会和县人民政府在七月下旬就组织了大批报告员、宣传员向人民宣传中国共产党领导人民军队艰苦奋斗的历史，和现在继续加强国防建设的重要性。各区乡人民政府在“八一”前都曾召开烈士家属、军人家属座谈会，彻底检查优抚工作，并征求他们对于改进优抚工作的意见。各乡、村群众这几天都在集会座谈，回忆第二次国内革命战争时期共产党领导他们进行武装斗争的情形。
    当地驻军某部在开展勤学苦练运动中学习了建军史，并且组织了宣传队、秧歌队和活报队，向群众宣传建军史。“八一”那天，驻军并准备举行“军民联谊运动大会”和演剧等活动。
    第二次国内革命战争时期中央民主政府所在地——瑞金县叶坪村人民，为了迎接“八一”建军节，正在积极重建“红军烈士纪念塔”，争取提早完工。
