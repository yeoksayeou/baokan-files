　　Xinhua News Agency, July 19th, Rome dispatch: The Italian Gasperi government, due to the escalating crisis within the Christian Democratic Party, submitted its resignation on the evening of July 16th. Italian President Einaudi accepted Gasperi's resignation and began consultations with representatives of various political parties on the 17th to resolve the cabinet crisis.
　　The resignation of the Gasperi government, which had continuously ruled Italy for five years and seven months since December 1, 1945, is the result of a long-simmering crisis within the Christian Democratic Party and the growing dissatisfaction of the people with the party. The immediate trigger for this event was the resignation of Treasury and Budget Minister, Christian Democrat Pella. Pella submitted his resignation to Gasperi because his fiscal and economic policies were fiercely criticized by many members of his own party. After this, Gasperi tried desperately to prevent a crisis in the entire cabinet, but failed, and finally had to resign.
　　This event exposed that the crisis within the Christian Democratic Party has reached an irreparable point, and its rule in Italy has reached an unsustainable state. As early as January of this year, the Speaker of the Italian Chamber of Deputies, Christian Democrat Gronchi, demanded at a parliamentary meeting of the party that Foreign Minister Sforza, Defense Minister Pacciardi, and Treasury Minister Pella be replaced, on the grounds that they "overly support a policy that is increasingly closely cooperating with the United States." Later, this rift continued to widen. On July 11th, when the Chamber of Deputies voted on the fascist "civil defense" bill, thirty or forty Christian Democratic deputies voted against it along with the Communist and Socialist deputies. Thus, although the Christian Democratic Party controls an absolute majority in both the upper and lower houses of parliament, it can no longer guarantee the rule of the Gasperi government. Regarding this point, the reactionary Roman newspaper *Il Tempo* once said: "It is a completely novel fact that a government with an absolute majority in parliament is unstable." This time, a United Press International dispatch from Rome on the 17th couldn't help but exclaim in shock: "In the history of the Italian Parliament, it is the first time that a cabinet has resigned without a vote of no confidence from the parliament."
　　Now, the entire imperialist camp is watching the Italian cabinet crisis with great anxiety, because it not only reflects the crisis of the Italian reactionaries, but also reflects the serious failure of American imperialism in Italy.

　　Xinhua News Agency, July 19th, Rome dispatch: After the Gasperi government submitted its resignation, the Italian Communist Party has officially demanded that a general election be held and peaceful policies be implemented in order to eliminate the current government crisis.
　　Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti met with Italian President Einaudi on the 18th, requesting Einaudi to order the dissolution of parliament and hold new general elections so that the people would have the opportunity to express their opinions on the current treacherous policies. The day before, Togliatti told reporters from *Il Paese* : "We ask the Italian people to use new elections to judge the government and the policies that have been implemented so far. We believe that the new government that presides over the elections should be led by people who transcend all parties. The outbreak of a serious crisis within a party that holds a majority in parliament is the result of implementing policies full of errors. Today, even Gasperi's own Christian Democratic Party recognizes that the country has become tired of policies based entirely on the North Atlantic Treaty and the anti-communist program."
　　On the 18th, the Secretariat of the Italian Communist Party also issued a statement on the domestic political situation after the resignation of the Gasperi government. The statement pointed out that the government crisis is not merely a manifestation of the internal struggle of the ruling Christian Democratic Party, but also a manifestation of the dissatisfaction of people from all walks of life in Italy with the Gasperi government's implementation of the US policy of war preparations. The statement emphasized the necessity of holding general elections, and pointed out that Italy now needs a peaceful policy more urgently than ever before. If this fundamental issue is not raised to the whole country, then no matter what new conspiracies and tricks are played, the current difficulties cannot be overcome, and instead the situation can only be worsened. The statement finally called on all those loyal to democracy to resolutely demand the implementation of a peaceful policy.

　　Xinhua News Agency, July 19th, Rome dispatch: According to TASS, the collapse of the Gasperi government has caused widespread reactions throughout Italy. Now, the call for the establishment of a peaceful government has resounded throughout Italy.
　　In Florence, Livorno, Ancona, Terni, major industrial centers in northern Italy, and Naples, Brindisi, Bari, Salerno and other places in southern Italy, democratic groups organized demonstrations and mass rallies demanding the establishment of a new government that can defend peace and the construction work of the Italian people. Workers at the famous Italian factories, the Fiat factory in Turin and the Alfa Romeo factory in Milan, and the trade union committees and trade unions in Modena, Ravenna and many other cities have passed resolutions firmly demanding the implementation of a new, peaceful and constructive economic policy.
　　The Italian Communist Party's newspaper *L'Unità* published an editorial commenting on the fall of the Gasperi government, saying: The resignation of the Gasperi government is a direct result of the recent provincial and municipal council elections. As early as March of this year, it was clear that the government was censured by the country and even lost the trust of its own majority party. Gasperi had hoped that the newly launched anti-communist terror and new election laws would help him change the situation. But this was just an illusion. In the local autonomous body elections in late May and early June, Gasperi received the people's answer: the Christian Democratic Party lost 2.5 million votes, while the people's bloc led by the Communist Party won a major victory. Italy now urgently needs a government of peace and construction. Let the will of the people be respected!

　　加斯贝利政府推行卖国政策被迫辞职
　  意共要求举行大选实施和平政策
　  全意人民正为建立和平政府展开斗争
    【新华社十九日讯】罗马消息：意大利的加斯贝利政府已因基督教民主党内长期存在的危机趋于尖锐化而在七月十六日晚提出总辞职。意大利总统伊诺第已接受了加斯贝利的辞呈，并于十七日开始和各政党代表协商解决内阁危机的办法。
    自从一九四五年十二月一日以来，在意大利连续执政了五年七个月的加斯贝利政府之总辞职，是基督教民主党内长期酝酿着危机的结果，也是全国人民日益对该党不满的结果。这次事件是以国库与预算部长、基督教民主党人贝拉的辞职为直接引火线的。贝拉因为他的财政经济政策受到本党许多议员的猛烈抨击而向加斯贝利提出辞呈。在此以后，加斯贝利曾拚命设法防止整个内阁发生危机，但都失败，最后才不得不提出总辞职。
    这次事件暴露了基督教民主党党内的危机已到了无可弥补的程度，它在意大利的统治已到了无法维持的地步。早在今年一月，意大利议会下院议长、基督教民主党人格隆齐就在该党议会党团会议上要求撤换外交部长史佛卓、国防部长巴齐亚第和国库部长贝拉，理由是他们“过分支持一个愈来愈亲密地与美国合作的政策”。以后，这种裂痕继续扩大，到七月十一日，下院表决法西斯的“民防”法案时，竟有三、四十名基督教民主党议员随着共产党和社会党议员一道投反对票。这样，基督教民主党虽然在议会上、下两院都控制着绝对多数，却已不能保证加斯贝利政府的统治。关于这一点，罗马反动的《时代报》过去曾经说过：“在议会中拥有绝对多数的政府居然不稳，是完全新奇的事实。”这一次，合众社罗马十七日电更不禁失声惊呼：“在意大利议会史上，议会未投不信任票而内阁径行辞职，这还是破题儿第一遭。”
    现在，整个帝国主义阵营都在十分忧虑地注视着意大利的内阁危机，因为它不但反映了是意大利反动派的危机，而且也反映了美帝国主义在意大利的严重失败。
    【新华社十九日讯】罗马消息：在加斯贝利政府提出总辞职以后，意大利共产党已正式要求举行大选并实施和平政策，这样来消除目前的政府危机。
    意大利共产党总书记托里亚蒂在十八日晤见意大利总统伊诺第，要求伊诺第下令解散议会，举行新的大选，好让人民有机会对现行的卖国政策表示意见。在这前一天，托里亚蒂就对《国家晚报》记者发表谈话说：“我们要求意大利人民借新的选举来评判政府和到现在为止所执行的政策。我们认为：主持选举的新政府，应该由超越一切党派的人来领导。一个在议会中占大多数的政党内部爆发了严重危机，这是实行充满了错误的政策的结果。今天，连加斯贝利自己的基督教民主党也认识到：全国已经厌倦了完全以北大西洋公约和反共纲领为基础的政策。”
    十八日，意共书记处也就加斯贝利政府辞职后国内的政治形势发表声明。声明指出：政府危机并非单纯表现了当权的基督教民主党的内部斗争，同时也表现了意大利各阶层人民不满加斯贝利政府执行美国的备战政策。声明强调必须举行大选，并指出：意大利现在比过去任何时候更迫切需要和平政策。如果不向全国提出这个根本问题，那么，无论玩弄什么新的阴谋和花样都克服不了当前的困难，而且反而只能使局势更加恶化。声明最后号召所有忠于民主的人都坚决要求实行和平政策。
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社罗马讯：加斯贝利政府的垮台在意大利全国引起了广泛的反应。现在，建立和平政府的呼声已经响遍了意大利全国。
    在意大利北部主要的工业中心佛罗伦萨、里窝那、安科纳、特尔尼和意大利南部的那不勒斯、布林的西、巴利、萨勒诺等地，民主团体组织了示威游行和群众大会，要求成立一个能够保卫和平、保卫意大利人民的建设工作的新政府。意大利有名的大工厂都灵菲亚特工厂和米兰阿尔法·罗米欧工厂的工人，摩登纳、拉温那和其他许多城市的工会委员会和工会，都通过了决议，坚决要求实行新的、和平与建设的经济政策。
    意大利共产党机关报《团结报》发表社论，评论加斯贝利政府垮台一事说：加斯贝利政府的辞职，是最近举行的省、市政委员会选举的直接后果。早在今年三月间，人们就已经看清楚：政府受到了全国的斥责，甚至失去了自己多数党方面的信任。加斯贝利曾希望新发动的反共恐怖和新选举法令帮助他改变形势。但是，这只是个幻想。在五月底和六月初的地方自治机构选举中，加斯贝利得到了人民的答案：基督教民主党丧失了二百五十万票，而以共产党为首的人民集团却获得了重大胜利。意大利现在迫切需要一个和平与建设的政府。让人民的意志受到尊重罢！
