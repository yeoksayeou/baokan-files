　　Strengthening the Distribution of Books and Periodicals in Rural Areas
　　To the Editor:
　　In order to better improve the distribution of books and periodicals, I suggest that all bookstores (mainly Xinhua Bookstore, China Book Distribution Company) establish a system of distributors in rural areas to carry out distribution work there. The broad masses of peasants have been liberated politically and economically, and as a result they need a lot of spiritual nourishment, especially today when the movement to resist America and aid Korea is being carried out in depth, and their needs are even more extensive and urgent. Unfortunately, this demand has not been well met.
　　Take my workplace, De County, Shandong, for example. It is only sixty or seventy li away from Dezhou, and the People's Daily can be seen the next day, so it cannot be considered a remote area. However, the Xinhua Bookstore in Dezhou rarely goes to the countryside on weekdays, and even when it does, it only goes to government offices and schools, and rarely interacts with farmers. Although the post office is also helping to promote books and periodicals, it is not very frequent. A postman has to visit thirty or forty villages a day, and it is impossible for him to go among the masses to promote sales. The peasant masses demand books and periodicals, but they cannot describe what they want, cannot name the books, and do not know where to buy them. It is very inappropriate for this to continue for a long time.
　　Therefore, a contradiction has arisen in the supply of books and periodicals: many enthusiastic authors have spent painstaking efforts writing many books for farmers, but the farmers do not have the opportunity to see them. Even in cities, where there are many bookstores and all kinds of books are displayed in front of readers, it is difficult for readers to choose the books they like and need in a short period of time. This shows that our distribution work is currently mainly limited to intellectuals and cadres, and is basically divorced from the actual needs of the workers and peasants. If we can establish a good distributor system, I think this problem can be largely solved.
　　Distributors who volunteer or are trained are bound to be avid readers and activists. Through contact with bookstores, they are familiar with the publishing industry and can introduce new books from the publishing industry to the masses around them at any time. In rural areas, they can write directly to the bookstore and purchase books through the post office.
　　The distributor is the leader of the masses' reading life, and at the same time a member of the masses. He is familiar with the masses' thinking, cultural level, hobbies and needs. Combining these factors to introduce books and periodicals will be of great help to the masses.
　　Some may say that we can rely on criticism and introductions in newspapers and periodicals to promote good reading materials and help the masses choose books and periodicals. But at present, how many district and township cadres or farmers can regularly read articles that criticize and introduce new books? In fact, isn't the distributor's oral introduction a "critical introduction" that goes deep into the masses? Moreover, for the workers and peasants, the critical introductions in newspapers and periodicals can only play the guiding role required through distributors. Otherwise, it is difficult for the critical introductions in newspapers and periodicals to directly take effect.
　　With distributors, publishers can also learn what books the masses need, what content, and what forms are most popular. This not only directly helps writers and publishers, enabling books to be judged good or bad, but also makes future publishing work more in line with the needs of the masses and gradually move towards planning.
　　Lenin said: "Correspondents are the pillars of newspapers." I think that if our "distributors" are well established, they can also be said to be the "pillars" of publishers.
　　To establish a good distributor system, I think we should focus on doing the following:
　　(1) Xinhua Bookstores in various places should select several villages for key pilot projects to gain experience and gradually promote them.
　　(2) The propaganda cadres of the Party's district committee organs should lead the work of distributors in all their subordinate villages and make the rural reading movement well integrated with the work.
　　(3) Compile a good new book catalog, and it is best to publish a "Distributor's Handbook" to introduce the content of new books and exchange distribution experience.
　　(4) Bookstores can provide distributors with some conveniences, such as unified payment of postage by the bookstore for letters to the bookstore, preferential treatment for distributors to buy books, and rewards for good work, etc.
　　When a person reads a good book, he naturally wants to recommend it to others. The masses have this need, and as long as we organize and promote it, we will definitely be able to achieve rapid development.

　　Editor's Note: Comrade Yang Li's suggestion is very good, and it is hoped that relevant agencies will take it into consideration.

### 加强书刊在农村中的发行工作

　  加强书刊在农村中的发行工作编辑同志：
    为了更好地搞好书刊发行工作，我建议各书店（主要是新华书店、中国图书发行公司）在农村建立发行员的制度，借以开展农村的发行工作。广大的农民在政治和经济上都翻身了，跟着就需要很多精神食粮，尤其在深入开展抗美援朝运动的今天，他们的要求更为广泛、迫切。但是，可惜得很，这要求没有能够得到很好的解决。
    就拿我所工作的地点——山东德县来说吧。这里离德州市只有六、七十里地，人民日报第二天就能看到，不能算是偏远地区。但是，设在德州市的新华书店平日很少有人下乡，就是下乡，也只能到机关学校走走，和农民很少有来往。邮局固然也在帮助推销书刊，但很不经常。一个邮递员，一天要走三、四十个村子，也不可能到群众中去推销。农民群众要求书刊，但他们说不出样子来，叫不出书名来，也不知道到哪里去买，这样长久自流下去，是很不应该的。
    因此，在书刊供应中出现了这样一种矛盾：许多热心的作者费尽心血为农民写作了许多书，农民可没有看见的机会。就是在城市中，书店很多，各色各样的书摆在读者面前，也很难使读者在很短的时间内选择到他所喜欢而且需要的书。这说明我们的发行工作，目前主要还局限在知识分子和干部内，基本上是脱离工农群众的实际需要的。如果我们能把发行员制度建立好，我想大体可以解决这个问题。
    自愿参加或经过培养建立起的发行员，必然是喜欢读书的积极分子。他们经过和书店的联系，熟悉出版界的情况，可以随时把出版界的新书，介绍给他们周围的群众。在农村里，可以由他们直接写信给书店，经邮局购买。
    发行员是群众读书生活的领导者，同时也是群众中的一分子，他熟悉群众的思想、文化程度、爱好和需要。结合这些情况介绍书刊，对于群众的帮助一定很大。
    也许有人说，我们可以依靠报刊上的批评介绍来推广优良读物，帮助群众选择书刊。但是在目前，有多少区乡干部或农民能经常读到批评介绍新书的文章呢？事实上，发行员的口头介绍，不正是深入群众的“批评介绍”吗？而且，对工农群众来说，报刊上的批评介绍只有通过发行员才能发挥所要求的指导作用，不然，要想使报刊上的批评介绍直接发生作用是困难的。
    有了发行员，出版家通过他们，还可以经常了解群众需要些什么书籍，什么内容、什么形式的最受欢迎。这样，不但直接帮助了作家和出版家，使书刊好坏受到鉴定，还可以使今后的出版工作更切合群众的需要，并逐步走向计划化。
    列宁说：“通讯员是报纸的柱石”，我想，我们的“发行员”建立好了，也可说是出版家的“柱石”。
    要建立好发行员制度，我想应着重作好下面几点：
    （一）各地新华书店应选择几个村庄作重点试办，以取得经验，逐步推广。
    （二）党的区委机关的宣传干部，应该领导所属各乡村的发行员的工作，使农村读书运动很好地和工作结合起来。
    （三）编好新书目录，最好出版“发行员手册”，介绍新书内容，并交流发行经验。
    （四）书店可以给予发行员一些便利，如向书店去信联系，可以由书店统一支付邮资，发行员买书给予优待，工作好的有奖励等等。
    一个人，看了一本好书，很自然地要推荐给别人看。群众既有这种要求，只要我们加以组织和推广，一定能得到很快的发展。

    编者按：杨力同志这一建议很好，希望有关机关参考。
