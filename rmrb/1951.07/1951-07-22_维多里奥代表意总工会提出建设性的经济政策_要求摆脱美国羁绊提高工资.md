　　Xinhua News Agency, Rome, July 19th (TASS): Italian General Confederation of Labor Secretary Vittorio, addressing the press regarding the Italian government crisis, pointed out that the causes of the crisis, in addition to the foreign factors that brought the government to an impasse, included the severe domestic economic crisis caused by the rule of the Christian Democratic Party. He represented the General Confederation of Labor in proposing constructive economic policies.

　　Vittorio pointed out: The current economic situation in Italy is: the economic situation of the middle class has seriously deteriorated, and an increasingly large number of workers are becoming impoverished. Except for the production of a few monopolistic cartels, other production is now stagnant, and unemployment is constantly increasing. The severity of the Italian economic crisis can be seen from the alarming increase in bankruptcies and bounced checks. The average number of bankruptcies per month has increased from 88 in 1948 to 280 in the first few months of 1951, while the average number of bounced checks per month has increased from 12,000 to 100,000 during the same period. Simultaneously with the bankruptcy of family handicrafts, small and medium-sized industrialists and merchants, the profits of large capitalists have increased to a shameful extent. In 1950, their profits increased by 200 billion lire compared to 1949.

　　These are all the result of the fiscal policies of Finance Minister Pella, whose purpose is to reduce civilian production and the needs of the people. This is a short-sighted policy, which will inevitably lead to further deterioration of the economic situation, further aggravation of unemployment and mass poverty, and ultimately means inflation.

　　Vittorio then pointed out: Unfortunately, the opposition within the Christian Democratic Party that opposes Pella's policies, although expressing the increasingly strong dissatisfaction of the broad masses of the people, has not been able to formulate constructive economic policies that are contrary to the policies implemented so far. Then, Vittorio solemnly announced: The recent plenary meeting of the Italian General Confederation of Labor leadership committee put forward such a constructive approach. This is the three-point program adopted by the plenary meeting: (1) Increase the wages of workers in all industries to expand domestic demand, thereby promoting a general economic upswing. (2) Increase the employment rate of labor by increasing investment in production, eliminating all forms of excessive exploitation imposed on employed workers, and eliminating artificially expanded unemployment. (3) Allow Italy to break free from American shackles and the obligation to supply funds for expanding armaments, and implement a policy of conducting trade equally with all countries in the world, especially with Eastern European and Asian countries, because these countries are in a period of rapid economic recovery, which creates huge regular possibilities for Italy, enabling it to conduct beneficial trade with them.

　　维多里奥代表意总工会
　  提出建设性的经济政策
　  要求摆脱美国羁绊提高工资
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社罗马十九日讯：意大利总工会总书记维多里奥就意大利发生政府危机一事向报界发表谈话，指出发生危机的原因，除了使政府陷入绝境的国外因素以外，就是基督教民主党统治所造成的国内严重的经济危机，并代表总工会提出了建设性的经济政策。
    维多里奥指出：意大利目前的经济状况是：中等阶层经济状况严重恶化，越来越广大的劳动者日益穷困。除了少数垄断性的康采恩的生产外，其他的生产现在都停滞了，失业不断增加。意大利经济危机的严重性只要从破产与拒绝支付票据情事险恶地增加一事就可以看得出来。每月平均破产的数目已从一九四八年的八十八起增加到一九五一年前几个月份的二百八十起，而每月平均拒绝支付票据的数目则已在同一时期内，从一万二千起增加到了十万起。与家庭手工业、中小工业家和商人破产的同时，大资本家的利润却增加到可耻的程度，在一九五○年，他们的利润比一九四九年的利润增加了二千亿里拉。
    这些都是财政部长贝拉的财政政策所造成的结果，这个政策的目的，是要缩减民用生产与人民的需求。这是一个近视的政策，它必然要引起经济状况的进一步恶化、失业与群众贫困的进一步加剧，而最后意味着通货膨胀。
    维多里奥接着指出：不幸的是，基督教民主党内部反对贝拉政策的反对派，虽然表现了广大阶层人民的愈益厉害的不满情绪，可是，并没有能够制订与迄今实施的政策相反的建设性的经济政策方针。然后，维多里奥郑重宣布：最近举行的意大利总工会领导委员会全体会议就提出了这种建设性的方针。这就是全体会议通过的三点纲领：（一）提高各业劳动者工资，以扩大国内需求，从而促成普遍的经济高潮。（二）提高劳动力的就业率，其办法就是增加生产投资，消除加在就业工人身上的一切形式的超额剥削，消除人为扩大的失业。（三）使意大利摆脱美国的羁绊和供给扩充军备经费的义务，执行与世界各国一视同仁地进行贸易的政策，特别是与东欧及亚洲国家进行贸易，因为这些国家正在急速地恢复经济的时期，而给意大利创造了巨大的经常的可能性，使它可以与它们进行有利的贸易。
