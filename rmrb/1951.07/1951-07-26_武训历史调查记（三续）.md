　　A Historical Investigation of Wu Xun (Continued, Part 3)
    (III) The Nature of Wu Xun's Schools
    Wu Xun Historical Investigation Team
    Wu Xun established three schools. The "Chongxian Yishu" in Liulin Town, Tangyi County, was founded in 1888 (the 14th year of the Guangxu reign). The "Yishu" in Yang'erzhuang, Guantao County, was established in 1889, or the 15th year of the Guangxu reign, through cooperation between Wu Xun and the monk Liao Zheng, mainly using Liao Zheng's property. This date differs from previous accounts about Wu Xun; we are basing it on the inscriptions on two stone tablets that still exist in Yang'erzhuang. The "Yishu" in Yushi Lane, Linqing Town, was established in the year of Wu Xun's death, 1896 (the 22nd year of the Guangxu reign). After investigation, we believe that the nature of the three schools was the same: they were all schools for landlords and merchants. However, the "Chongxian Yishu" was the most typical, so we focused our investigation on this school. Because the "Chongxian Yishu" was Wu Xun's first school, and Wu Xun died in the ninth year after its establishment, he undoubtedly put more effort into this school. Liulin Town is located in the northwest of Tangyi County, about forty li from both Tangyi City and Linqing City. It is a market town larger than Tangyi County City.

    According to the materials we investigated, this school in Liulin Town, whether in terms of student composition or the composition of teachers and directors (school board members), can be called an unjust school for the laboring people.

    The unjust nature of Wu Xun's schools has been embellished and concealed for decades by the propaganda of the reactionary rulers of the Manchu Qing government, the Northern Warlord government, the Kuomintang government, Japanese imperialism, and the traitor Wang Jingwei. They propagated that Wu Xun established "charity schools" for the "poor." However, current Wu Xun propagandists, such as Sun Yu, who has studied Wu Xun for seven or eight years and personally investigated in Tangyi, and Li Shizhao, a native of Liaocheng (45 li from Tangyi) who claims to have studied and investigated Wu Xun for nearly twenty years, say: "Wu Xun stood firm on the class position," "established charity schools for poor children," "served the people" (Sun Yu); "This conscious person of the oppressed and exploited laboring people" had already "practiced" "education for the people," and was a "great model of the laboring people" and the "ox of the people" (Li Shizhao). All of these are completely wrong, spreading reactionary ideas and deceiving the masses from the standpoint of the landlord class and the bourgeoisie.

    Regarding Wu Xun's schools, there are two completely different views in Tangyi, Guantao, and Linqing counties. The landlord class calls them "charity schools"; the laboring people call them unjust schools. For example, the opinion of Mu Zhongshan (a landlord from Liulin Town, Tangyi, who served as a director of "Chongxian Yishu" in 1913, age 66) represents the landlord class's view of Wu Xun's schools. He believes that Wu Xun's schools were "charity schools," saying that Wu Xun once said: "I am poor and cannot afford to study, so I want poor people to study." When we asked if he had heard it himself, he said he had, and added: "I was already thirteen or fourteen years old at that time!" In fact, he was only eleven years old when Wu Xun died. The most wonderful thing is that, in order to talk to us, he suddenly grew four years older, telling us he was seventy years old. We learned through other investigations that he was only sixty-six years old. However, Xiao Zhenlu (a 70-year-old resident of Xiaoji Village, Tangyi County, who was a poor peasant in the past and is now a new middle peasant) protested to us: "The poor could not afford to attend Wu Doumo's school, how can it be called a charity school? Today's schools are charity schools, and the poor can all go to school." His opinion represents the view of the general laboring people in Tangyi, Linqing, and Guantao counties on Wu Xun's schools.

    In order to thoroughly investigate the inside story of Wu Xun's schools, we visited many elderly people. Among them, Ni Zhanyun from Ni Tun Village, Tangyi County, remembered the most clearly and spoke the most detailedly. He admired Wu Xun and praised the "charity school," but he was willing to tell the truth, saying what he knew and not saying what he did not know. He came from a landlord family, is now 81 years old, studied at "Chongxian Yishu" for seven years (1890-1896, i.e., the 16th to 22nd years of the Guangxu reign), and was also a Xiucai (a degree holder in the imperial examination). This old man, who has a good memory and is in good spirits, also said to us with a smile: "Wu Xun even acted as my matchmaker!" He told us that "Chongxian Yishu" had no introductory classes at all in the first seven years (1888-1894), only classics classes. And the students in the classics classes were mostly from "good families" (landlords), and the rest were rich peasants or merchants. There were no middle peasants, let alone poor peasants or farm laborers. Some of the students were Xiucai who came to study with the teachers. They studied books such as the Book of Poetry, the Book of Documents, the Book of Changes, the Book of Rites, the Spring and Autumn Annals, and the Zuo Zhuan. Only those who could write "full-length" eight-legged essays were qualified to enter the school. There were more than fifty students in his class, but because it was too long ago, he only remembered thirty-four. Among these thirty-four, twenty-three passed the Xiucai examination, and one passed the Juren examination. The following survey table of classics class students is mainly based on Ni Zhanyun's account, supplemented by the opinions of some other people.

    Survey Table of Classics Class Students of Wu Xun's "Chongxian Yishu" (1890-1896)

(Table data here - see original document)

    According to the requirement that one must be able to write a "full-length" eight-legged essay to be admitted, the admission qualifications for "Chongxian Yishu" were very high. Therefore, the qualifications of the teachers were also very high, requiring Jinshi (the highest degree in the imperial examination), Juren (the second-highest degree in the imperial examination), or Bagong (students recommended to the imperial college). Ni Zhanyun said that Cui Zhun, Gu Zhong'an, Teng Xiufeng, etc., were all very famous teachers at the time. Wherever they went to teach, they were always followed by a group of students. The so-called "students from several counties and hundreds of li came to study with their books" (Liu Zizhou: Biography of Righteous School Master Wu Gong) refers to highly qualified students who came either following the teachers or attracted by their reputation, many of whom were already Xiucai. The situation of the teachers can be seen in the table below:

(Teacher Data - See Original Document)

    "Chongxian Yishu" established introductory classes in 1895, the eighth year after the establishment of the classics classes in the school, and the year before Wu Xun's death. Four years later, in 1898, these introductory classes were discontinued. Wu Xun and the landlords who cooperated with him were not interested in establishing these lower-level introductory classes. The reason why Wu Xun and his collaborator Yang Shufang ran introductory classes for these four years was because the merchants in Liulin Town expressed dissatisfaction that their children could not attend school. Wu Xun and Yang Shufang reluctantly ran an introductory class to perfunctorily satisfy them.

    Regarding the composition of the students, after our investigation, not only were there no children of poor peasants in the classics classes, but there were also very few children of poor peasants in the introductory classes. Guo Jiwu, 79 (resident of Liulin Town, formerly a poor peasant, who was allocated six mu of land during the land reform), told us: "At that time, we couldn't even afford to eat, how could we study?" Han Zhuling, 72 (resident of Liulin Town, middle peasant), said: "The charity school did not charge tuition fees, but gifts had to be given to the teachers, four hundred qian for each of the two major festivals, the Dragon Boat Festival and the Mid-Autumn Festival. At that time, three hundred qian bought a dou of sorghum, and four hundred qian bought a dou of millet." Han Zhuling, a middle peasant, studied in the introductory class in 1895, but dropped out because he was beaten for not being able to afford the festival gifts. He said that there were about twenty students in his class, and he could only remember fifteen. The following table is mainly based on his account.

    Survey Table of Introductory Class Students of Wu Xun's "Chongxian Yishu" (1895)

(Table data here - see original document)

    The above students, except for Wu Lulin and Wu Fanglin, who were from Wu Village, were all from Liulin Town.

    The above table proves that among the students in the introductory class, only one was a poor peasant, three were middle peasants, and one was an outsider selling baked wheat cakes, who could be considered laboring people. The rest were merchants and relatively wealthy families in Liulin Town.

    Regarding the teachers of the introductory class, according to Han Zhuling, his teacher was Zhang Danchu, a Xiucai. He dropped out of school after a year and did not know the situation in the school anymore. Another teacher was Li Jinduo, also a Xiucai, according to Yang Guanghan (resident of Liulin Town, grandson of Yang Shufang, landlord who was struggled against, age 70). Zhang Danchu taught for one year (1895), and Li Jinduo taught for three years (1896-1898).

    Now let's take a look at the directors of Wu Xun's schools, and we can see the ferocious camp of local bullies and landlords in Tangyi, Guantao, and Linqing counties. On a stone tablet in the Wu Xun Normal School in Liulin Town, we found a list of the first batch of directors of "Chongxian Yishu," totaling forty-one people. The masses told us that only Wu Xun's nephew Wu Maolin was a poor peasant. He was included in the inscription because he worked for Wu Xun year-round, urging the payment of rent and collecting debts. The vast majority of the other directors were local bullies and landlords with official titles. It is this group of guys who exploited and oppressed the laboring people who have been turned into "enlightened gentry" or "progressive people" with a sense of justice in Sun Yu's "Biography of Wu Xun" and Li Shizhao's "Illustrated Biography of Wu Xun"!

    Yang Shufang (resident of Liulin Town, student recommended to the imperial college, local tyrant landlord, head of the militia, who died in 1900), who is still hated by the laboring people of Tangyi County, was the main director of "Chongxian Yishu." After his death, his children and grandchildren continued to control this school. Yang Shufang was the uncle of Yang Mingqian (head of the "Yongqing Regiment" in Liulin), a resolute counter-revolutionary who fought against Song Jingshi. Not long after Yang Mingqian was killed by Song Jingshi, Yang Shufang became the head of the "Yongqing Regiment." In the year of Song Jingshi's defeat (1863), he was already 37 years old, while Wu Xun was 25 years old. Wu Xun's being appreciated by him was not accidental, but had political and economic reasons. From a political point of view, the Yang family was then the mortal enemy of the laboring people of Tangyi County. It is unknown how many people were directly or indirectly killed by them. They completely flattened Xiaoliuguan Village (about ten li west of Liulin Town, Song Jingshi's home), and the laboring people will never forget this bloody feud. From the year Song Jingshi's uprising began (1860) to now, it has been 91 years, but the laboring people of Tangyi can still vividly recount this history in detail. This not only expresses their remembrance and praise of the heroes, but also expresses that they want their children and grandchildren to not forget this hatred! Wang Licheng, 81 (resident of Xiaoliuguan Village, poor peasant), could not continue speaking when he talked about Song Jingshi's mother being nailed to the city gate of Dongchang Prefecture (Liaocheng). Yang Shufang was an extremely cunning guy. He understood that force alone would not work, and that he had to do something to win people's hearts. Therefore, Wu Xun, who clamored to "build a charity school for the poor," became a good tool for him to deceive the people. Economically, Yang Shufang wanted to get his hands on Wu Xun's property. At this time, Wu Xun had accumulated a large amount of property, more than seven thousand strings of cash, in Tangyi alone. Once the "charity school" was established, it would have to be controlled by Yang Shufang. So at this time, Yang Shufang asked Wu Xun to run the "charity school," and it was impossible for Wu Xun not to run it even if he wanted to. After Wu Xun died, the Yang family seized the school as their private property and focused solely on plundering property. Sometimes there were only a few students in the school, and later it was simply closed down for several years, showing that they had no intention of running a charity school at all. The above are the main reasons why the school was established. Of course, at this time, the landlord class also had the need to educate their children. They could use Wu Xun's debt interest, land rent, and donations to build a school for their children, why not? The "Record of the Beginning and End of Establishing the School" says: "Tangyi and Guantao are adjacent to the borders of Linqing County, and since the military disaster of Xianfeng Jia Yin, there are more poor families who cannot study than in other counties" (page 36). The "military disaster" referred to here is that the Northern Expeditionary Army of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom once captured many county towns in this area in 1854. The "poor families" referred to here are the landlord class themselves. In this way, on the one hand, the landlord class in Yang Shufang and other places needed to run schools, and on the other hand, Wu Xun had already ridden on the tiger's back. After making a name for himself for thirty years, he had accumulated seven thousand strings of cash, and he was forced to run a school. Therefore, Wu Xun established a school for the landlord class, and under the leadership of the landlord class.

    The funds for building the school buildings of "Chongxian Yishu" mainly came from Wu Xun's debt interest and land rent, all of which were scraped from the laboring people. In addition, there was also a part of Wu Xun's forced fundraising, relying on Yang Shufang's power to "kowtow everywhere, and you had to give even if you didn't want to" (Guo Jiwu). However, in terms of labor and building materials, Yang Shufang personally took the lead, using his own prestige and pretending to "be for the poor" to force each village to send vehicles and people. Guo Jiwu said: "At that time, we were required to send more from large villages and less from small villages. Those with vehicles sent vehicles, those with livestock sent livestock, and those without vehicles and livestock had to send people. You had to come! My family was so poor that we couldn't make ends meet, and we were still asked to carry bricks and tiles for a few days." Yang Shufang was such an "enlightened gentry" whose hands were covered with the blood of the laboring people and who forced the laboring people to contribute labor to build the "charity school"!

    The above list is a verbatim copy from the inscription. Lou Junling is listed first, and Yang Shufang, who actually presided over the school, is listed second, because Lou Junling was a Wu Jinshi (a Jinshi specializing in military affairs), and his "official title" was higher than that of Yang Shufang. Zhao Biguang, who is listed third, was appointed by the official government as one of the two "helpers" of the school after Wu Changda, a distant relative of Wu Xun, accused the Yang family of seizing the school. He was the leader of another faction of landlords.

    Wu Xun, the traitor of the laboring people, the big gangster, the big creditor, and the big landlord, relied on the power of feudal rule to exploit and extort the wealth of the laboring people and establish three schools for the landlords and merchants. This situation is in line with the laws of the feudal system. The relations of production in the feudal system are that the landlord class controls the main means of production. The landlord class has political power and an army to protect this relationship of production. Therefore, only the landlord class can monopolize culture and run schools. The exploited and oppressed peasant class cannot have the opportunity to be educated and learn culture. In the eyes of the feudal landlord class, there is no need to educate and teach culture to peasants who engage in agricultural labor using simple tools. This is the law of the feudal system for thousands of years, and it is the principle indicated by historical materialism. The exploited and oppressed peasant class must turn over in cultural education, run their own schools, learn culture, and receive education, only under the leadership of the working class, overthrow the political power of the landlord class, establish a political power based on the worker-peasant alliance, and abolish the feudal relations of production between landlords and peasants, that is, the landlord's ownership of land, and change it into the peasant's ownership of land, then this is possible. This is possible in the liberated areas of China and throughout China after the establishment of the People's Republic of China. Wu Xun lived in the Manchu Qing Dynasty, and he was willing to serve the landlord class, deceiving the peasants with the slogan of "for the poor," and in fact, he established three schools for the landlords and merchants. This is in line with the laws of feudal society. Only those Wu Xun propagandists who have no Marxist common sense and stand on a reactionary position, such as Sun Yu and Li Shizhao, would insist that the children of landlords and the children of merchants are the children of the laboring people; they would insist on dressing up a group of local bullies and resolute counter-revolutionaries as "enlightened gentry" and "progressive people," saying that these people are also willing to run schools for the laboring people; they would insist on putting a "revolutionary" coat on Wu Xun, and say that a reactionary faction is a revolutionary faction; all of this, if it is not intentional rumor-mongering and deception, is an extreme error in thinking.

　　武训历史调查记（三续）
    （三）武训学校的性质
    武训历史调查团
    武训办了三所学校。堂邑县柳林镇的“崇贤义塾”，是一八八八年（光绪十四年）办成的。武训和了证和尚合作，而主要是用了证的财产办成的馆陶县杨二庄“义塾”，成立于一八八九年，即光绪十五年，这个年代，和以前一些关于武训的著作的说法不同，我们是根据现存于杨二庄的两块石碑上的记载。临清镇御史巷“义塾”成立的那年，也就是武训死的那年，即一八九六年（光绪二十二年）。经过调查，我们认为，三所学校的性质是一样的，都是为地主和商人办的学校，但“崇贤义塾”是最典型的一所，我们就把重点放在这所学校的调查上。因为“崇贤义塾”是武训的第一所学校，而武训在这所学校成立的第九个年头才死去，无疑的，他在这所学校上用的心计是特别多些。柳林镇位于堂邑县的西北部，距堂邑城和临清城均为四十余里，是一个较堂邑县城还要大些的集镇。
    根据我们调查的材料看来，柳林镇这所学校，无论是在学生成份方面，或者是在教师和首事人（校董）的成份方面，对于劳动人民说来，都称得起是一所不义之学。
    武训学校的不义的性质，几十年来被满清政府、北洋军阀政府、国民党政府、日本帝国主义和汉奸汪精卫等反动统治者的宣传所粉饰和掩盖着，他们宣传武训兴的是“义学”，为的是“贫寒”。而目前的武训宣传者们，例如研究武训七、八年之久，并亲自到堂邑调查过的孙瑜；聊城（距堂邑四十五里）人氏，自称研究和调查武训将近二十年的李士钊，却说：“武训站稳了阶级的立场”，“为穷孩子们兴办义学”，“为人民大众服务”（孙瑜）；“这位被压迫被剥削的劳动人民的先觉者”，早已“实践”了“教育为人民”，是“劳动人民的伟大典型”和“人民大众的牛”（李士钊）。这些都是完全错误的，是站在地主阶级和资产阶级的立场上来散布反动思想，欺骗人民群众的。
    对于武训学校，在堂邑、馆陶、临清等县，有着两种完全不同的看法。地主阶级说是“义学”；劳动人民则说是不义之学。例如穆仲山（堂邑柳林镇人，地主，一九一三年任过“崇贤义塾”的校董，六十六岁）的意见，即代表地主阶级对武训学校的看法。他认为武训学校是“义学”，他说武训曾经说过：“我穷，念不起书，我要穷人念书。”当我们问是否他自己听见过，他说他听见过，并且补充说：“我那时已经十三、四岁了！”其实武训死的那年他才十一岁。最妙的是他为了和我们谈话，陡然长了四岁年纪，对我们说他是七十岁。我们经过其他方面的调查，知道他只有六十六岁。可是，劳动人民萧振禄（堂邑县萧集村人，七十岁，过去是贫农，现为新中农）却抗议地对我们说：“武豆沫的学校穷人上不起，怎么能叫义学？现在的学校才是义学，穷人都能上学了。”他的这个意见，代表了堂邑、临清、馆陶等县一般劳动人民对武训学校的看法。
    为了彻底查清武训学校的内幕，我们访问了不少的老年人。其中记忆得最清楚、讲说得最详细的，是堂邑县倪屯村的倪瞻云。他崇拜武训，称赞“义学”，可是他肯说老实话，知道的就说，不知道的就不说。他出身于地主家庭，现年八十一岁，在“崇贤义塾”读书达七年之久（一八九○年——一八九六年，即光绪十六年至光绪二十二年），并且是个秀才。这位记忆力很好、精神颇佳的老人，还笑迷迷地对我们说：“武训还做过我的媒人哪！”他告诉我们，“崇贤义塾”在头七年（一八八八年——一八九四年），根本没有蒙班，只有经班。而经班的学生，大多数都是“好户”（地主），其余也是富农或商人，没有一个中农，更不要说贫雇农了。学生中，有一些是跟着老师来念书的秀才。读的是诗、书、易、礼、春秋、左传等书。能够做“满篇”八股文章的人，才有入学的资格。他那一班学生共有五十余人，因为年代太久，他只记得起三十四人。这三十四人当中，就有二十三人进了学（秀才），一人中了举。下面这份经班学生调查表，主要是根据倪瞻云的述说，加上其他一些人的意见列出来的。
    武训“崇贤义塾”经班学生调查表（一八九○年——一八九六年）
    上表所称外课生，是指不住在学校的学生，他们把文章作好送请学校老师去修改。
    根据要能做“满篇”八股文章的才能入学这一点看来，“崇贤义塾”的学生入学资格是很高的。因此，教师的资格也很高，须要进士、举人或拔贡才行。倪瞻云说：崔准、顾仲安、滕绣封等，都是当时极有名望的先生，他们不管到那儿去教书，身边总是跟着一批学生。所谓“数县学生数十百里负笈来学”（刘子舟：义学正武公传），正是跟着老师来的或者慕老师之名而来的程度很高的学生，其中许多已经是秀才。教师的情况，看下表便知：
    “崇贤义塾”在一八九五年，即在该塾经班开办之后第八年，亦即武训死的前一年，才设立蒙班，四年以后，即一八九八年以后，这种蒙班就废止了。武训及和他合作的地主们对于设立这种程度较低的蒙班是不感兴趣的。武训及其合作者杨树坊之所以在这四年内开办了蒙班，是因为柳林镇上的商人们表示不满，他们的子弟不能上学，武训和杨树坊才勉强办了个蒙班，敷衍他们一下。
    在学生的成份方面，经过我们调查，不但经班学生中一个贫苦农民的子弟也没有，就是蒙班学生中贫苦农民的子弟也很少。七十九岁的郭继武（柳林镇人，过去是贫农，土地改革分到六亩地）对我们说：“那时候，我们饭都吃不上，还能念书？”七十二岁的韩祝龄（柳林镇人，中农）说：“义学不收学费，可是要给老师送礼，每年端午、中秋两大节，每节四百钱。那时候，三百钱一斗高粱，四百钱一斗小米。”韩祝龄是个中农，于一八九五年在蒙班读过书，后因送不起节礼挨打而退学。他说他那一班有二十来个学生，他只能记起十五个。下面这个表，主要是根据他的述说。
    武训“崇贤义塾”蒙班学生调查表（一八九五年）
     以上的学生，除了武鲁林和武芳林是武庄人而外，余皆柳林镇人。
    上表证明，蒙班学生中只有一个贫农，三个中农和一个卖火烧的外来户，算是劳动人民，其余都是柳林镇上的商人和比较有钱的人家。
    关于蒙班的教师，据韩祝龄说，他的老师叫张丹初，是个秀才。一年以后他退了学，就不知这个学校里的情形了。另一个叫李金铎，也是个秀才，是杨光汉（柳林镇人，杨树坊之孙，被斗地主，七十岁）说的。张丹初教了一年（一八九五年），李金铎教了三年（一八九六年——一八九八年）。
    我们现在来看一看武训学校的首事人，就可以看出一个堂邑、馆陶、临清等县的豪绅地主们的凶恶阵营。我们在柳林镇武训师范学校里的一块石碑上，找到了“崇贤义塾”的第一批首事人的名单，共有四十一人。群众告诉我们，其中只有武训的族侄孙武茂林，是个贫农。他因为常年替武训催租、讨债做跑腿工作，被列入了碑文。其他首事人，绝大多数是有功名的豪绅地主。就是这样一批剥削、压迫劳动人民的家伙，在孙瑜的《武训传》和李士钊的《武训画传》中，却变成了富有正义感的“开明士绅”或“进步人士”了！
    现在尚被堂邑县劳动人民所痛恨的杨树坊（柳林镇人，岁贡生，恶霸地主，民团团长，于一九○○年死去），就是“崇贤义塾”的主要首事人。他死后，他的儿孙一直把持这所学校。杨树坊就是打宋景诗的坚决反革命分子杨鸣谦（柳林“永清团”团长）的亲侄。杨鸣谦被宋景诗打死以后，没有多久，杨树坊就做了“永清团”的团长。在宋景诗失败的那年（一八六三年），他已经三十七岁，武训则是二十五岁。武训之被他赏识，并不是偶然的，是有着政治和经济的原因的。从政治方面来说，杨家当时是堂邑县劳动人民的死敌。被他们直接、间接屠杀的人民不知有多少，他们把小刘贯庄（柳林镇以西约十里，宋景诗的家）全平了，劳动人民永远记着这个血海深仇。从宋景诗起义的那年（一八六○年）算起，到现在已有九十一年，可是，堂邑的劳动人民尚能详细而生动地述说这段历史。这并不仅是表示着他们对于英雄们的怀念与歌颂，而且也表示了要他们的儿孙别忘记这个仇恨！八十一岁的王立成（小刘贯庄人，贫农），讲到宋景诗的老娘被钉死在东昌府（聊城）的城门上的时候，难过得讲不下去了。杨树坊是一个极狡猾的家伙，他明白单靠武力不行，还得做一些收买人心的事情。因此，嚷着“修个义学为贫寒”的武训，就成了他欺骗人民的良好工具。在经济方面，杨树坊想打武训财产的主意。武训这时单在堂邑方面，已集了很大一笔财产，计七千多吊，“义学”一办成就不得不受杨树坊的控制。所以此时杨树坊叫武训办“义学”，武训虽欲不办也不可能了。武训一死，杨家将学校霸为私产，专在财产的掠夺上做文章，学校学生有时少到只有几个人，后来有几年率性停办，毫无意于什么义学不义学，就证明了这点。以上是学校所以办成的主要原因。当然，这时地主阶级也有教育自己子弟的必要。他们利用武训的债利、地租和捐款，就可以为他们的子孙建立一所学校，何乐而不为。“兴学始末记”中说：“堂邑、馆陶与临郡接境，自咸丰甲寅兵燹后，贫家不能读书者较之他郡尤多”（第三十六页）。这里所指的“兵燹”，就是一八五四年太平天国的北伐军曾经攻克过这一带好些县城。这里所指的“贫家”，就是地主阶级自己。这样，一方面杨树坊等地主阶级需要办学校，一方面武训已骑在老虎背上，打了三十年招牌，积了七千吊款子，也逼得不能不办，因此武训就替地主阶级、并在地主阶级主持下，办起学校来了。
    “崇贤义塾”建立校舍的经费，主要是武训的债利和地租，这些都是从劳动人民身上刮来的。此外，还有武训依仗杨树坊的势力“到处磕头，不给不行”（郭继武）强迫募捐的部分。但在劳动力和建筑材料方面，却是杨树坊亲自出马，以自己的威势，假“为贫寒”之名，强迫各村派车、派人。郭继武说：“当时是要俺们大村多派，小村少派，有车的出车，有牲口的出牲口，没有车和牲口的就得出人，不来不行！俺家穷的上顿接不上下顿，还叫俺去搬了几天砖瓦。”杨树坊就是这样一个两手涂满了劳动人民的鲜血、并且强迫劳动人民出力修“义学”的“开明士绅”！
    上面这个名单是从碑上一字不易地照抄的。娄峻岭列在第一名，实际上主持学校的杨树坊列在第二名，是因为娄峻岭是武进士，“功名”比杨树坊为高的缘故。第三名赵壁光，就是在武训的疏族武昌达控告杨家霸占学校后，由官厅任为该校两名“帮理”之一，是另一派地主的首领。
    劳动人民的叛徒、大流氓、大债主兼大地主的武训，依靠封建统治的势力，剥削、敲诈劳动人民的财富，替地主和商人办成三所学校，这种情形，是合乎封建制度的规律的。封建制度的生产关系，是地主阶级掌握主要的生产资料。地主阶级有政权，有军队，保护这种生产关系。因而只有地主阶级能够垄断文化，办学校。被剥削被压迫的农民阶级是不可能有受教育学文化的机会的。在封建地主阶级看来，使用简单工具从事农业劳动的农民，也没有要使他们受教育学文化的必要。这是几千年封建制度的规律，是唯物史观所指示的法则。被剥削被压迫的农民阶级要在文化教育方面翻身，要自己办学校，学文化，受教育，只有在工人阶级领导之下，推翻地主阶级的政权，建立以工农联盟为基础的政权，并取消地主与农民间的封建的生产关系即地主的土地所有制，改变成为农民的土地所有制，才有这种可能。在中国的解放区和中华人民共和国建立以后的全中国，就有这种可能了。武训生在满清时代，他甘心为地主阶级服务，以“为贫寒”的口号欺骗农民，而实际上为地主和商人办成了三所学校，这是合乎封建社会的规律的。只有那些毫无马克思主义的常识，并且是站在反动立场上的武训宣传者们，例如孙瑜和李士钊，才硬说地主子弟、商人子弟是劳动人民的子弟；硬把一批恶霸地主和坚决反革命分子装扮成“开明士绅”和“进步人士”，说这些人也愿意为劳动人民开办学校；硬给武训披上“革命”的外衣，把一个反动派说成一个革命派；这种种，如果不是有意的造谣欺骗，就是思想上的极端错误。（本节完，全文未完）（附图表）
