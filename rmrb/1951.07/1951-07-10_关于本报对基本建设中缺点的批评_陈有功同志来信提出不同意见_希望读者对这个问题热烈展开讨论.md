Concerning Criticism in This Newspaper Regarding Shortcomings in Capital Construction
    Comrade Chen Yougong Writes a Letter Presenting a Different Opinion
    Hoping Readers Will Actively Engage in Discussion on This Issue
    Editor's Note: We are publishing a letter from Comrade Chen Yougong here. In this letter, he believes that this newspaper's continuous criticism of the phenomenon of blind construction without proper design in capital construction is the argument of "scholars sitting in glass windows," who "do not know the difficulty of the matter." His main points are two: First, he believes that this newspaper's criticism "completely negates" the achievements of capital construction. Second, he believes that the errors in capital construction are mainly due to objective difficulties. For example, "various enterprise organizations have just been established," "budget settlements are extremely untimely," there is a lack of technical personnel, and "the tasks are heavy, the time is urgent, and the resources are insufficient." Comrade Chen Yougong's argument is obviously inappropriate, but it represents the views of some enterprise leading cadres, and in order to truly solve the problem of the importance of design in capital construction, these views must be clarified in the discussion. Therefore, we have decided to publish Comrade Chen Yougong's letter here, hoping that comrades and readers will engage in a heated discussion on this.
             Comrade Editor:
    Regarding the articles on capital construction problems that your newspaper has recently published continuously, I would like to offer the following opinions for your reference.
    Judging from the news recently published continuously in your newspaper, it seems that our capital construction work in all aspects is all shortcomings, either "serious waste" or "careless," without a trace of achievement.
    If you pay attention to observation, the fact is not the case.
    The People's Republic of China has been established for only two short years. The old enterprises were taken over not long ago, and many factories and mines are still in the recovery stage. Some units, not to mention implementing economic accounting, do not even know what economic accounting is. Among the leading cadres, most have not learned modern industrial management. Although the general technical personnel have been educated and reformed for two years, their labor attitude has not completely changed from bureaucratic enterprises, and their enthusiasm still needs to be further inspired. Under these circumstances, we are gritting our teeth to do capital construction work. The time is too short, but we have made great achievements in this area, but these achievements have been ignored and completely negated!
    None of the leading cadres among the enterprises is not subjectively trying to do a good job in capital construction. No one wants to "watch the hard work of the working people wasted there" (!). Then why have some errors occurred? We must look at it from the perspective of objective conditions.
    No one can deny the fact that we have extremely many objective difficulties. These facts are: the organizations of various enterprises have just been established, some democratic management is only formal, wages have not been fully adjusted, asset inventories are only preliminary, cost accounting has just been learned, and budget settlements are extremely untimely - especially the budget problem, it is reported, and it is not approved for a long time, and serious tasks are pressing on the head. Should capital construction be done or not?
    In order to complete the task, we must do it. But the problem comes. How can capital construction be done solely based on political level? There must be many engineering and technical personnel. But these people are very lacking. One person has to do the work of two, three, or even five people. The task is heavy, the time is urgent, and the resources are even more insufficient. Cement is piled up in the open air. Who doesn't know that it will rain and suffer losses? There is not enough money to build a mat shed. Can you build an iron roof? Without suitable pants to wear, of course, you can't fantasize about satin jackets. Scholars sit in glass windows, with a set of principles, not knowing the difficulty of specific things. Take the contract as an example: the deadline is written, and it is estimated that it can be completed, but transportation problems occur; vehicles are solved, and transportation is hindered; labor organization is done well, and workers have raised opinions on wages. How can the supervisor's two eyes see through several miles inside and outside? Corruption is an individual phenomenon and cannot be generalized. Winter has arrived. Knowing that work should be stopped, it has to be done because the task is urgent. ... The like, scholars sitting in glass windows, are not easy to see clearly.
    Isn't the design not perfect because of the lack of technical personnel? There should be 50 technical personnel, but in fact there are only 20, and these 20 are not necessarily competent. Do you do it or not? The newspaper should have 100 reporters, but in reality there are only 10, and the newspaper must be published. The work is different, but the situation is the same. We cannot put all these sins on the leading cadres. How can you just scold the health department if there are too many flies and mosquitoes? The problem of capital construction is no exception. It is related to all aspects, and we should study the reasons from many aspects.      Chen Yougong

　　关于本报对基本建设中缺点的批评
    陈有功同志来信提出不同意见
    希望读者对这个问题热烈展开讨论
    编者按：我们这里发表了陈有功同志一封信。在这封信里，他认为：本报对于基本建设中没有正确设计即行盲目施工的现象的连续批评，是“学者坐在玻璃窗内”，“不知事情难办”的议论。他的论点，主要有两个：第一，认为本报这种批评，是把基本建设的成绩，“一笔抹杀了”。第二，认为基本建设中之所以发生错误，主要是由于客观的困难。譬如“各企业组织刚刚建立”，“预算决算极不及时”，缺乏技术人员，“任务既重，时间又急，资材更不充裕”等。陈有功同志的论点，显然是不妥当的，但它代表着一部分企业领导干部的意见，而为了真正解决基本建设中的设计的重要性问题，就不能不在讨论中把这些意见加以澄清。因此我们决定把陈有功同志的信发表在这里，希望读者同志们对此展开热烈的讨论。
              编辑同志：
    我对于贵报目前连续发表的关于基本建设问题，提出以下意见，请做参考。
    从贵报最近连续发表的消息中看，我们各方面的基本建设工作好像全是缺点，不是“严重浪费”，就是“马马虎虎”，没有一丝一毫成绩可言。
    留心观察一下，事实并非如此。
    中华人民共和国成立不过短短二年，旧的企业接管不久，许多厂矿还在恢复阶段，有的单位，不要说是实行经济核算，就连经济核算之为何物，也不清楚。领导干部之中，大部没有学会现代工业的管理，一般技术人员虽经二年教育改造，但是劳动态度并未从官僚企业完全转过来，积极性还待继续启发。在这种情况之下，我们是硬着头皮来干基本建设工作。时间太短，我们却在这一方面做出了很大成绩，然而这些成绩却被人们忽视，一笔抹煞了！
    各企业间的领导干部没有一个不是在主观上努力要把基本建设工作做好的，没有一个人愿意“眼睁睁地看着劳动人民的血汗在那里浪费”（！）。然则为什么又会发生了一些错误呢？我们不能不从客观条件方面看一看。
    谁也不能否认我们客观方面的困难的极多的事实。这些事实是：各企业的组织刚刚建立，有的民主管理还只是形式，工资亦未全面调整，资产清理只是初步，成本核算刚刚学会，预算决算极不及时，——特别是预算问题，报了上去，好久不批，而严重的任务又压在头上，基本建设干是不干？
    为了完成任务，不能不干。可是问题就来了，基本建设，单是靠着政治水平怎么能行？必须很多工程技术人员。偏偏这些人又很缺乏，一个人要做两个、三个甚至五个人的事。任务既重，时间又急，资材更不充裕。洋灰堆在露天，谁还不知道下要雨受损失？搭个席棚钱都不够，你能修盖铁顶么？没有合适的裤子可穿，当然不能幻想缎子马褂。学者坐在玻璃窗内，道理一套一套，不知具体事情难办。即以合同一项来讲：期限写好，估计也能完工，可是运输发生问题；车辆解决，交通又有阻碍；劳动组织搞好了，职工对工资又提出了意见。监工天生两只眼睛，怎能望穿几里内外？贪污乃是个别现象，不能一概而论。冬季到了，明明知道应该停工，但任务急迫不得不干。………诸如此类，学者坐在玻璃窗内，是不大容易看真切的。
    设计不周，还不是因为技术人员缺乏么？应有技术人员五十名，事实只有二十名，而这二十名并不见得个个胜任，干不干呢？报馆应有记者一百，实际只有十名，也得出报。工作不同，情况则一。我们不能把这些罪过完全推在领导干部身上。苍蝇蚊子太多，单骂卫生机关怎能行呢？基本建设问题也不例外，关系各个方面，我们应从诸多方面研究原因。      陈有功
