　　At the West Lake Workers' Sanatorium
    (Narrated by Xue Zhaozhang of the Taiyuan Railway Locomotive Depot)
    On the afternoon of May 21st, I arrived in Hangzhou by train. Comrades from the sanatorium had already prepared a pleasure boat on West Lake to take me to the "Liu Manor," where the workers' sanatorium is located. Sitting on the boat, I watched the emerald green lake water rise and fall, as if welcoming us working people. I felt an indescribable excitement and joy in my heart. People often say, "Above there is heaven, below there are Suzhou and Hangzhou." In the past, only bureaucrats, landlords, and capitalists could come here to enjoy themselves, but now, thanks to the victory of the Chinese revolution under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, this paradise of West Lake belongs to us working people.
    The "Liu Manor" workers' sanatorium is a two-story Western-style building. The outside of the building is planted with various flowers and plants, and the inside of the building has spring beds and new quilts. I and old hero Ji Gengsheng lived in a building called "W望山楼望山楼angshan Building." The room was painted beautifully, the floor was washed shiny, and there were colored glass windows all around. Opening the window, you could see South Peak, North Peak, and the entire beautiful West Lake. The sanatorium has various books, newspapers, and cultural and recreational supplies such as chess and balls. We ate very exquisite food every day and were often given vitamin shots. On the evening of the day we arrived at West Lake, old hero Ji said to me: "I have worked for more than fifty years, and I never dreamed that I could come to West Lake for a stroll." I myself kept not being able to fall asleep, not knowing if the bed was too soft or if I was too excited. I thought of old hero Ji's words: after working for decades, being able to come to West Lake today is really something I never dreamed of; therefore, I love West Lake even more, and I know that West Lake is now by my side. All this good fortune is due to Chairman Mao's leadership.
    The sanatorium stipulates that each person can stay for fifteen to thirty days. During these days, we enjoyed and happily toured the famous historical sites of West Lake. The comrades in the sanatorium treated us too well, soliciting our opinions every day. Wherever we wanted to go, they accompanied us.
    When we were recuperating at West Lake, more than ten members of the British People's Delegation came to visit us. Old hero Ji and I told them: "Under the wise leadership of our great people's leader Chairman Mao, the working people of our country have truly turned themselves over. We are recuperating here, and our wages are still paid as usual. This is something that Chinese workers have never had before." The members of the British People's Delegation envied the glorious status and happy life of the Chinese working class, and they said that they would introduce these situations to the British people after returning home.
    On June 5th, old hero Ji and I returned by car. I hated that the car was driving too slowly, and I wanted to quickly return to my job, to think of more ways to increase production and defend our beloved motherland.

　　在西湖工人休养院里
    （太原铁路机务段薛照章口述）
    五月二十一日下午，我乘火车到了杭州，休养院里的同志早已在西湖准备了游船，要把我接到工人休养院所在地“刘庄”去。我坐在船上看着碧绿的湖水，一起一伏，好像在欢迎我们劳动人民，我心里有说不出的兴奋和愉快。人们常听说“上有天堂，下有苏杭”，在过去，只有官僚、地主、资本家们，才能到这里来享受，而现在，由于共产党和毛主席领导中国革命得到胜利，西湖这个天堂是属于咱们劳动人民的了。
    “刘庄”工人休养院是一处两层楼的洋房，房子外面种满了各种花草，房子里面是弹簧床，新被子。我和计根生老英雄住在称为“望山楼”的一所楼房里，房间里面油漆得很漂亮，地板洗得光油油的，四周都是彩色的玻璃窗，打开窗子就可以看南高峰，北高峰，和整个美丽的西湖。休养院有各种书报和棋子、球类等文化娱乐用品。我们每天吃的是很精美的食物，还时常给打维他命针。到西湖的当天晚上，计老英雄对我说：“我做了五十多年的工，连作梦也想不到能到西湖来逛逛。”我自己也老是睡不着觉，也不知床太软呢？还是自己太兴奋？我想着计老英雄的话：做了几十年的工，今天能到西湖，真是做梦也想不到的；因此，我就更加爱西湖，我知道现在西湖就在我的身边。这个福气，全是毛主席领导我们得来的。
    休养院规定每人可以住十五天到三十天，我们在这几天当中尽情地愉快地游览了西湖各处名胜古迹。休养院里的同志对我们招待太好了，每天征求我们的意见，我们想到那里，他们就陪同我们去。
    我们在西湖休养的时候，曾有英国人民访问团的十多个团员来访问我们，我和计老英雄告诉他们说：“在我们伟大的人民领袖毛主席英明领导下，我国劳动人民真正翻身了。我们在这儿休养，工资照常发给，这是中国工人从来没有过的事情。”英国人民访问团的团员们很羡慕中国工人阶级的光荣地位和幸福生活，他们表示返国后要把这些情形介绍给英国人民。
    六月五日，我和计老英雄乘车回来，我恨车子开得太慢，我想赶快回到工作岗位上，要多想办法提高生产，来保卫我们可爱的祖国。
            （张宗煌记）
