The Ideological Leadership of the Dalian Railway Factory Party Organization in Production
    Huang Yi

    Editor's Note: In the production departments of enterprises, the ideological leadership of the Party organization is the fundamental key to mobilizing all forces to ensure the completion of production tasks. Ideological leadership is the primary task of the Party organization. This newsletter raises this issue and is worthy of study in various regions.

    The Dalian Railway Factory began implementing the economic accounting system in May 1950, and by the end of the year, it had successfully completed 129 percent of its eight-month production and financial plan. As a result, it won the Central-Chang Railway Administration's "Excellent Red Flag" award four times. In the process of over fulfilling the production and financial plan, the factory's CCP Party Committee grasped and carried out in-depth ideological leadership, playing a supervisory and guaranteeing role.

    At the beginning of the factory's production and financial plan, the ideological understanding of cadres and employees was extremely inconsistent. First, the idea of the supply system was resisting the implementation of the plan. Some people said, "We have a clear conscience. We worked honestly for the country in the past and will continue to work honestly for the country in the future. Accounting or not doesn't matter to us!" Some said, "We have a low level of education and can't do accounting. We only need to ensure the completion of production tasks." Others believed, "Accounting and researching costs are the business of the factory director and the cost accounting department, and have nothing to do with me." Another idea was to mistakenly regard economic accounting as "reducing personnel" and "increasing the labor intensity of workers." Therefore, among the cadres, on the one hand, there was a fear of not being able to complete the task due to the reduction of production personnel; on the other hand, in order to complete the production and financial plan, they simply planned to increase labor intensity. Among the workers, some worried that their jobs would be jeopardized due to the implementation of the economic accounting system and the tightening of staffing quotas. In response to the above situation, the factory Party Committee not only organized all Party members to study the production and financial plan, but also educated all employees through the trade union, thereby resolving the ideological concerns of cadres and workers, establishing a correct economic accounting ideology, and laying a good foundation for the successful completion of the eight-month production and financial plan.

    In the factory's completion of the production and financial plan, a crucial link was whether the use of raw materials was appropriate. Because the expenditure on raw materials accounted for more than 70 percent of the factory's financial plan. The Party Committee seized this important link, calling on and organizing all Party members to lead all employees to make full use of waste materials, save raw materials, and clean up accumulated materials, fighting to eliminate waste and reduce and strive to eliminate defective products and rework. After the education of "anti-waste, detailed accounting," all employees automatically exposed many serious waste phenomena. The initial inspection results of the boiler branch factory in the anti-waste study showed that the waste of raw materials, only oil and grease, reached 15 kilograms per day, and 450 kilograms per month. Because no one was responsible for the tools, 340 taps were wasted in just one and a half months in June. Also, due to unreasonable labor organization and improper use of labor, 3,379 hours were wasted in June, equivalent to 422 man-hours. There was also a lot of waste due to defective products and rework. Then, the Party called on Party members to unite all employees and strive to save materials, use waste materials, eliminate rework, and shorten the repair time of locomotives and boilers. All employees of the branch factory immediately responded enthusiastically to the Party's call, and the production and financial situation of the branch factory underwent a major transformation.

    Another extremely important link in completing the production and financial plan is to ensure the implementation of technical measures proposed by the administration in the workshop. However, when a new technical measure and operation method is conveyed from the leadership to the masses, or gathered from the masses and then widely promoted, it often encounters great resistance among the masses. The Party paid attention to fighting against this kind of conservative view and narrow empiricism. At the beginning of the promotion of the Soviet advanced work method of "electric welding stay bolts" in the boiler branch factory, a large number of people in the riveting group believed that it was "not safe"; some people refused to accept it on the grounds that "they had never done it this way since working for the railway." Therefore, although the branch factory administration arranged to promote this advanced work method very early, no one responded and no one experimented. At this time, the Party organization of the branch factory criticized the conservative views of Wu Diansheng, the Communist Party member who was the leader of the electric welding group; on the other hand, it proposed to the branch factory administration the suggestion of "organizing experiments by the branch factory." Because Wu Diansheng changed his attitude, and the cadres of the branch factory personally carried out experiments, the advanced work method was quickly accepted by the masses. Some even began to learn the Soviet Kovalev work method, increasing the cutting speed by 128 percent in one month.

    In the process of completing the production and financial plan, the Party Committee deeply grasped the existing problems in production and mobilized the whole Party and all employees to actively carry out the rationalization proposal movement. In September 1950, due to the poor quality of materials from the alloy factory, all copper tiles of six locomotives in the locomotive branch factory were reworked, which seriously affected the branch factory's plan to complete the production task on the 26th. The branch factory Party branch committee immediately resolved that the copper tile group should convene a meeting of Party members and activists to study "whether there is a way to complete the task on schedule without working overtime." At this meeting, Chen Zhaoxin put forward a method, which was unanimously agreed upon after discussion, and then suggested it to the administration. Later, the copper tile group completed the task ahead of schedule due to the improvement of the work method. In the same month, the same branch factory suffered a serious backlog of steady car cylinders due to the shortage of lathes, and from the branch factory director to the team leader and group leader were at a loss. At this time, the Party instructed the Communist Party member Yu Hongsheng to try his best to find a solution to this major problem. After Yu Hongsheng's one month of painstaking research, he finally converted an abandoned old lathe into a horizontal lathe, which increased efficiency by 50 percent compared to the original lathe, and successfully solved the cylinder backlog phenomenon.

    Due to the Party organization's strengthening of ideological leadership, rationalization proposals have become a regular mass movement in the factory. In 1950, as a result of the implementation of rationalization proposals, the factory saved the state more than 16.2 billion yuan.

　　大连铁路工厂党组织在生产中的思想领导
    黄夷
    编者按：在企业生产部门中，党组织的思想领导是动员一切力量保证完成生产任务的基本关键。思想领导是党组织的首要工作。这一篇通讯提出了这一问题，值得各地研究。
    大连铁路工厂从一九五○年五月开始实行经济核算制，到年底胜利的完成了八个月的生产财务计划的百分之一百二十九。因此曾获得中长铁路管理局优胜红旗奖四次。在超额完成生产财务计划中，该厂中共党委曾抓紧进行了深入的思想领导，发挥了监督与保证作用。
    该厂生产财务计划公布之初，干部和员工的思想认识极不一致。首先是供给制的思想在抵抗着计划的实施。有人说：“我们问心无愧，过去老老实实为国家工作，将来也会老老实实地为国家工作，算不算账对我们没用！”有的说：“我们文化水平低，不会算账，只要保证完成生产任务就可以了。”还有的认为：“算账和研究成本是厂长和成本核算部门的事，与我无关。”另一种思想是错误地将经济核算看成“要减少人员”、“要提高工人的劳动强度”。因此在干部中，一方面怕减少了生产人员完不成任务；另方面为完成生产财务计划，单纯的在提高劳动强度上打算。在工人中，有人担心，因实行经济核算制、紧缩编制定员，自己的职业会失去保障。针对上述情况，该工厂党委除组织全体党员学习生产财务计划外；又通过工会，对全体员工进行教育，从而解决了干部和工人的思想顾虑，树立起正确的经济核算思想，为胜利完成八个月的生产财务计划打下了良好的基础。
    在该厂完成生产财务计划中，极重要的一环是原材料的使用是否得当的问题。因为原材料的一项开支，占全厂财务计划的百分之七十以上。党委就抓住这一重要环节，号召和组织全体党员带领全体员工尽量利用废料、节省原材料，清理堆集的物资，为杜绝浪费，减少和争取消灭废品、返手活而斗争。全体员工经过“反浪费、算细账”的教育后，即自动揭发了很多严重的浪费现象。锅炉分厂在反浪费的学习中，初步检查结果，原材料浪费只油脂一项每日即达十五公斤，每月要浪费四百五十公斤。工具因无人负责，只六月份一月中即浪费丝锥达三百四十根。又因劳动组织不合理，劳动力使用不当，六月份就浪费三千三百七十九小时，合四百二十二个人工。其他因产生废品和返手活而浪费的还很多。接着，党号召党员要团结全体职工，为节用材料、利用废料、消灭返手活、缩短机车锅炉修理时间等而努力。分厂全体员工立即热烈响应党的号召，使分厂的生产财务状况有了重大转变。
    完成生产财务计划的另一个极重要的环节，即是在车间保证实施行政提出的技术措施。但在一种新技术措施和作业方法，由领导贯彻到群众中去，或由群众中集中上来，再普遍推广时，往往在群众中受到很大的阻力。党就注意了向这种保守观点和狭隘的经验主义作斗争。锅炉分厂在推广苏联先进工作方法“电焊螺撑”之初，铆钉组中就有很大部分人认为“不保险”；有些人则借口“干铁路以来，没这样干过”而拒不接受。因此分厂行政虽很早布置了推广这种先进工作方法，但无人响应，无人试验。这时分厂的党组织一方面批评了电火组组长共产党员吴殿生的保守观点；另方面向分厂行政提出“由分厂组织试验”的建议。由于吴殿生转变了态度，加上分厂干部亲自动手试验，先进的工作法就很快地为群众所接受。有些并开始学习苏联郭瓦廖夫工作方法，一个月内提高切削速度百分之一百二十八。
    在完成生产财务计划中，党委深入的抓住生产中存在的问题，动员全党和全体员工积极地开展合理化建议运动。一九五○年九月份机车分厂铜瓦组因合金厂的材料不良，六辆机车的铜瓦全部返工，使该分厂在二十六日完成生产任务的计划受到严重影响。分厂党支部委员会当即决议由铜瓦组召开党员和积极分子会议，研究“在不加班的原则下，有没有办法按期完成任务”。在这个会议上，陈兆新提出了办法，经讨论后一致同意，便向行政上建议。后来铜瓦组因改进了工作方法，而提前完成了任务。该分厂在同一个月份中，因镟床不足，造成稳车汽缸的严重积压现象，而从分厂厂长到班长、组长都束手无策。此时，党即责成共产党员于洪盛尽力想法解决这一重大问题。经于洪盛一个月的苦心钻研，终于将一台丢弃不用的旧镟床改成了一台躺镟床，并且比原有镟床提高效率百分之五十，顺利地解决了汽缸积压现象。
    由于党组织加强了思想领导，合理化建议已成为该厂经常的群众性运动。一九五○年该厂因实施合理化建议的结果，为国家节约了一百六十二亿元之多。
