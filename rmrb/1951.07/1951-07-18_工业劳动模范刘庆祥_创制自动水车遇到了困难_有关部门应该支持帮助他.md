Industrial Model Worker Liu Qingxiang
	Encounters Difficulties in Creating Automatic Waterwheel
	Relevant Departments Should Support and Help Him
To the Editor:
	Liu Qingxiang, a national industrial model worker from the No. 2 Factory of the Jinan Municipal Industrial Bureau, has been working with worker Liu Qingfen for the past two years, painstakingly researching and creating an automatic waterwheel. This waterwheel does not require any power; it uses only its own reaction force to rotate on its own. Its water intake speed is equivalent to that of a Liberation-type waterwheel, but it saves a lot of labor. As long as someone watches the ditch, it can be used for irrigation. This automatic waterwheel has been basically successful after model experiments. If it can further receive assistance from relevant departments and agricultural tool experts, its final successful manufacture will create infinite wealth for China's agricultural production. Currently, Liu Qingxiang has encountered difficulties in manufacturing this automatic waterwheel. Liu Qingxiang has repeatedly proposed trial manufacturing to the factory department of the No. 2 Factory of the Jinan Municipal Industrial Bureau, but the administrative leaders of the factory have not paid enough attention to this. They either say that the factory mainly focuses on industrial construction and has no capacity to manufacture agricultural tools, or that this waterwheel is expensive and no one would buy it even if it were made. I believe these are all irresponsible statements. This attitude does not encourage but rather strikes a blow to the creative talents of the working people. Comrade Liu Qingxiang said to me: "I don't know how much brainpower and money I have spent researching this waterwheel. I didn't expect that after the experiment was successful, it still couldn't be made." I suggest that the No. 2 Factory of the Jinan Industrial Bureau and its leading organs attach great importance to this matter, seriously study whether this automatic waterwheel should be manufactured and promoted, and if it should be manufactured and promoted, it should be supported and helped.

　　工业劳动模范刘庆祥
　  创制自动水车遇到了困难
　  有关部门应该支持帮助他编辑同志：
    济南市工业局二厂全国工业劳动模范刘庆祥，与工人刘庆芬合作，经过两年来的苦心钻研，创造了一种自动式水车。这种水车不用任何动力，只用它本身的反动力，即能自行转动。其引水速度相等于解放式水车，但能节省很多劳力。只要有人看水沟，就可灌溉了。这种自动式水车，经过模型实验，已经基本成功。如能进一步得到有关部门和农具专家的帮助，最后制造成功，将给我国的农业生产创造无穷的财富。现在，刘庆祥在制造这种自动式水车时，遇到了困难。刘庆祥曾屡次向济南市工业局二厂厂部提议试造，但该厂行政领导干部对此却不够重视，或者说本厂以工业建设为主，无力制造农具；或者说这种水车价格高，即使作成了也没有人买。我认为这些都是毫不负责的说法。这种态度不是鼓励而是打击劳动人民的创造才能。刘庆祥同志对我说：“研究这种水车，我不知用了多少脑子，花了多少钱，想不到试验成功了，还不能造。”我建议济南工业局二厂及其领导机关，要十分重视这件事，认真研究一下，看这种自动水车应不应制造、推广，如果应该制造、推广，就该加以支持和帮助。
