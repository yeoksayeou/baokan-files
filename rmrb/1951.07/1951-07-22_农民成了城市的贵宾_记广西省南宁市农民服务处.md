　　Farmers Become Honored Guests of the City
　  ——A Record of the Nanning Municipal Farmers Service Center in Guangxi Province
    By our reporter Zhu Bo
    With the victory of bandit suppression, the connection between Nanning City and the countryside has become closer day by day, and the number of farmers entering and leaving the city has been increasing. In order to help farmers entering the city solve their difficulties, the Municipal People's Government established the Farmers Service Center on April 13th. The service center has seven staff members, plus a service team composed of ten people.
    The establishment of the Farmers Service Center has been warmly welcomed by the farmers, and the number of people coming to inquire about matters has been increasing day by day: 539 people in April, 1,186 in May, and 1,629 in June. Some of them came from Longjin, Ningming, Sile, Shangsi and other places near the Vietnamese border; some came from Qinzhou and other places near the coast of the Gulf of Tonkin; and some came from Zhenbian, Nama, and Du'an. They brought local products and seafood, crossed high mountains and ridges, and crossed large and small rivers to Nanning.
    Farmers who come to the Farmers Service Center feel like they have arrived at their own home. Here, beds with mosquito nets are prepared for them, and hot water is often available for them to drink, wash their faces, and wash their feet. The service center writes out the market prices of the day every day for farmers to refer to when buying and selling goods. For illiterate farmers, the staff helps them sell their local products and buy the daily necessities they need, and clearly tells them the prices of these goods.
    On June 29th, Chen Weiting, a farmer from Sile County, came to Nanning for the first time with cowhide. As soon as he entered the city, he could not tell the direction. A traffic policeman helped him find the Farmers Service Center. The staff of the Farmers Service Center warmly received this distinguished guest who had come from afar, arranged him in a very clean room, and helped him boil water and cook. He said with emotion: "I didn't know there was such a good service center. I only knew that the bandits had been wiped out and people could walk alone; if I had known that the city was so good, I would have come earlier." After he rested for a while, the staff of the service center told him the location of the trading company, the buying and selling procedures, and helped him send the cowhide to the trading company. When he came back after selling the cowhide, he told the comrades of the service center that the price he sold this time was much higher than in his hometown; only one cowhide was sold to a private merchant at a low price of 1,000 yuan per catty because it was not up to standard. The comrades of the service center immediately told him that cowhide that was not up to standard should also be sold for more than 3,000 yuan per catty. Only then did he realize that he had been deceived. The staff accompanied him to the private merchant, educated the merchant, and compensated him at a price of 3,000 yuan per catty. This incident moved Chen Weiting and made him feel that the service center was truly serving the people. Another time, a farmer named Zhong Hao from Nama brought more than one hundred catties of tung oil. It happened to be Sunday, and the oil company was not open. Zhong Hao was in a hurry to go back, so he wanted to sell the tung oil to private merchants, but some private merchants deliberately lowered the price. In order to prevent Zhong Hao from suffering losses and to enable him to go back a day earlier, the comrades of the service center collected more than one hundred catties of tung oil at the oil company's listed price and bought daily necessities for him on his behalf. When Zhong Hao was leaving, he said: "You are too good to me, I will come again."
    The Farmers Service Center has already played a great role in the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. Farmers from various places transport local products to Nanning and buy back the daily necessities they need. The transported local products include salt and seafood from Qinzhou, tung oil, anise oil, star anise from Baise and Longzhou, various medicinal materials from the mountains, cowhide, pigs, chickens, etc. According to the statistics in May: the local products transported by farmers from various places were worth a total of 1.251 billion yuan, and in June it increased by 360 million yuan compared with May. The farmers who come here have bought a lot of daily necessities. Wang Mingyuan, a farmer from Longming, looked at the plow, kitchen knife, salt, cloth, matches, etc. he bought and said happily: "This time I bought everything, I will do a good job in production when I go back." Huang Tianjiao, a farmer from Zhenbian County near the Yunnan border, pointed to the salt he bought and said: "Now salt is much cheaper than before, only more than 2,000 yuan per catty; when the bandits were rampant, three catties of salt could be exchanged for one hundred catties of white rice in our place, and the poor couldn't afford salt at all." A farmer from Du'an County bought kerosene in addition to salt, matches, and cloth, because kerosene lamps are more convenient and cheaper than tung oil and tea oil lamps.
    The farmers who came to Nanning unanimously praised the victory of the People's Liberation Army in suppressing bandits and the achievements of the People's Government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries. He Qiu, a fifteen-year-old salt farmer from Qinzhou, and another salt farmer transported salt to Nanning this time, climbing over the Shiwan Mountain, Qipo Ao, Mumian Ao, Wu Mian Ao and other mountains. He said: "These mountains used to have bandits, and people in our area got a headache when they heard about the Shiwan Mountain. In the past, people didn't dare to walk in groups, but now we two can swagger through. If it weren't for bandit suppression, there wouldn't be such a stable year." Lin Guifang from Heng County said: "When Heng County was besieged by bandits last year, there were bandits everywhere in the countryside, and the common people dared not go out of the village to farm, for fear of being captured by the bandits; this caused every household to drink porridge, and they couldn't even eat a little salt water. Now that the bandits have been wiped out, everyone can eat white rice and dry rice, and they can also eat meat, fish, and various vegetables. People in our area all say: 'The Communist Party and Chairman Mao saved us!'"

　　农民成了城市的贵宾
　  ——记广西省南宁市农民服务处
    本报记者　朱波
    随着剿匪的胜利，南宁市和农村的联系一天天的密切起来，出入城市的农民一天天在增多。市人民政府为了帮助进城的农民解决困难，在四月十三日成立了农民服务处。服务处有七个干部，另有由十个人组成的服务小组。
    农民服务处的成立，受到了农民的热烈欢迎，前来问事的人一天比一天地增加：四月份为五百三十九人，五月份一千一百八十六人，六月份增加到一千六百二十九人。其中有的来自靠近越南国境的龙津、宁明、思乐、上思等地；有的来自靠近东京湾海岸的钦州等地；有的来自镇边、那马和都安。他们带着土产、海货，翻过高山峻岭，渡过大川小河到了南宁。
    来到农民服务处的农民，都觉得好像到了自己的家。这里给他们准备了带有蚊帐的床铺，还经常备有供他们饮用、洗脸、洗脚的热水。服务处每天把当日的市场价格写出来，供农民作买卖东西时的参考。对不识字的农民，工作同志就帮助他们卖出土产，买进他们所需的日用品，并清楚地告诉他们这些货物的价格。
    六月二十九日，思乐县的农民陈伟廷，带着牛皮，第一次到了南宁。他一进城就辨不清方向了。交通警察帮助他找到了农民服务处。农民服务处的工作人员热情地接待了这位远道赶来的贵宾，把他安置在一间很干净的房子里，并帮助烧水煮饭。他感动地说：“我不知道有这样好的服务处。我光知道股匪已肃清了，人们可以单独走路了；要早知道城里这样好，我早就来了。”待他休息了一会，服务处的工作人员便告诉他贸易公司的地点，买卖的手续，并帮他把牛皮送到了贸易公司。他卖完牛皮回来，对服务处的同志说，这次卖的价钱比家乡高出很多；只有一张牛皮因为不合规格，以每斤一千元的低价卖给了私商。服务处的同志立即告诉他，不合规格的牛皮一斤也要卖三千元以上。他这才知道受骗了。工作同志就陪他到私商那儿，对商人进行了教育，按一斤三千元的价格补偿了他。这件事情感动了陈伟廷，使他感到服务处真正是为人民服务的。又一次，来自那马的一位名叫钟号的农民，担来了一百多斤桐油。可巧那天是礼拜天，油脂公司不办公。钟号赶着要回去，便想把桐油卖给私商，可是，有的私商却故意压低价格。服务处的同志为了不叫钟号吃亏，又能使他早一天回去，就按油脂公司的牌价，把一百多斤桐油收下了，还代他买了日用品。钟号临走时说：“你们对我太好了，我还要来。”
    农民服务处对城乡物资交流已经起了很大的作用。各地农民把土产运到南宁，又买回他们所需要的日用品。运来的土产包括钦州的食盐、海味，百色、龙州一带的桐油、茴油、八角（茴香）山地的各种药材、牛皮、猪、鸡等。据五月份的统计：各地农民运来的土产品共值十二亿五千一百余万元，六月份比五月增加了三亿六千万元。来这里的农民都购买了很多日用品。龙茗的农民王明远看着他买的犁、菜刀、食盐、纱布、火柴等，高兴地说：“这次可买齐全了，回去以后好好搞生产吧。”靠近云南边境的镇边县的农民黄天教指着买来的食盐说：“现在食盐比过去贱得多了，仅两千多元一斤；闹土匪时，在我们那里三斤食盐就可以换一百斤白米，穷人谁也吃不起盐。”都安县的一个农民除了买食盐、火柴、纱布以外，还买了煤油，因为煤油灯比桐油、茶油灯要方便，而且又省钱。
    来南宁的农民，一致称赞人民解放军剿匪的胜利，和人民政府镇压反革命的成绩。钦州十五岁的盐民何球，这次和另一个盐民运盐到南宁来，爬过了十万大山、七婆坳、木棉坳、吴棉坳等大山。他说：“这些山过去都有土匪，我们那里的人一听说十万大山就头疼。过去人们成群结伙也不敢走，现在我们两个人就大摇大摆地走过来了。要不是剿匪，那里有这样平稳的年头。”横县的林桂芳说：“去年横县城被土匪包围时，乡里到处是土匪，老百姓都不敢出村种田，生怕被土匪抓走；这样就闹得家家户户都喝稀饭，连一点盐水也吃不到。现在土匪被剿光了，大家都能吃白米干饭了，还可以吃到肉、鱼和各种青菜。我们那里的人都说：‘共产党毛主席救了我们！’”
