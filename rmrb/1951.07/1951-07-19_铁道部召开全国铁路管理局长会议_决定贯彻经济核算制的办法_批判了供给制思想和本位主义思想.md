　　The Ministry of Railways convened a National Railway Bureau Directors Conference from June 20th to 26th, focusing on the issue of how to implement the economic accounting system. Based on the experience of the China Changchun Railway Bureau's implementation of the economic accounting system and the experiences of key economic accounting system experiments in various localities since the Bureau Directors Conference in February of this year, the conference decided to carry out the following work in the second half of this year: (1) Thoroughly convey and organize discussions of production and financial plans among the workers, making them production and financial plans for each unit, and even each workshop team. (2) Verify capital funds. Efforts to further investigate working capital will be completed by the end of August. The investigation of fixed assets will begin in September after necessary preparations and the formulation of necessary forms by the Ministry of Railways, and will end at the end of November. (3) On the basis of production competitions and the anti-waste movement, formulate various major production quotas. (4) Improve the accounting system and strengthen cost management. Cultivate a sufficient number of skilled accounting personnel and strengthen the organizations and work of the planning, statistics, and labor wage departments. Establish a responsibility system and a job title responsibility system for major tasks. (5) Units with the conditions should implement the eight-grade wage system. Establish a sound reward system.

　　The attending representatives unanimously agreed that the economic accounting system is the basic method for managing state-owned enterprises under the guidance of the national planned economy. The experience of the China Changchun Railway is a concrete example of the implementation of advanced Soviet experience in Chinese railways. In order to smoothly promote the economic accounting system, the conference strictly criticized the supply system mentality of lacking cost concepts and emphasizing quantity over quality, and also criticized localism.

　　铁道部召开全国铁路管理局长会议
　  决定贯彻经济核算制的办法
　  批判了供给制思想和本位主义思想
    中央人民政府铁道部于六月二十日至二十六日召开了全国铁路管理局局长会议，着重地讨论了如何贯彻经济核算制问题。会议根据中长铁路局实行经济核算制和自今年二月管理局长会议以后各地重点实验经济核算制的经验，决定在今年下半年进行以下工作：（一）在工人群众中深入传达和组织讨论生产及财务计划，使其成为每个单位的以至每个车间小组的生产财务计划。（二）查定资金。进一步清查流动资金的工作争取在八月底完成。固定资产的清查工作，先由铁道部进行必要的准备工作和制定必要的表格，九月份开始，在十一月底结束。（三）在生产竞赛及反浪费运动的基础上，制定各种主要生产定额。（四）健全会计制度，加强成本管理工作。培养足够的熟练的会计人员，加强计划、统计、劳动工资部门的机构和工作。建立主要工作的负责制和职名责任制。（五）有条件的单位实行八级工资制度。建立健全的奖励制度。
    到会代表一致认为经济核算制是在国家计划经济的指导下，经营管理国营企业的基本方法。中长铁路的经验便是苏联先进经验在中国铁路实行的具体榜样。为了顺利推行经济核算制，会议严格地批判了没有成本观念，重量不重质的供给制思想，同时也批判了本位主义思想。
