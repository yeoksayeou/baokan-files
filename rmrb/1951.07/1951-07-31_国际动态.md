　　Dollar and Blood
　　According to the July issue of the American Labor Research Association publication "Economic Notes," the total value of direct American investment abroad has almost doubled in the past eight years, reaching $13 billion. The U.S. Department of Commerce has explained the enormous profits from these direct investments: "The increase in the value of direct foreign investment is largely due to the reinvestment of undistributed profits from branches and subsidiaries, and most of the outflow of capital also comes from income earned abroad in 1948 and 1949. The total income earned by foreign branches and subsidiaries is almost equal to the total capital outflow from the American parent companies."
　　The Wall Street monopolists' money abroad is like a snowball that keeps getting bigger and bigger, but it is covered with the blood of the people of the vassal states and colonies.

　　"Un-American Activities Committee" West German Branch
　　The West German Bonn puppet government recently planned to establish a "Non-Federal Republic Committee" modeled after the American "Un-American Activities Committee." It has the power to deprive all people designated as "non-Federal Republic" and can be implemented on anyone who maintains relations with any individual or organization within the German Democratic Republic. Although members of parliament have privileges, they are also subject to the power of this committee.
　　This "committee" is actually a branch of the "Un-American Activities Committee" because it is dealing with the German people who love peace and democracy and have "Un-American activities."

  美元与鲜血
    据美国劳工研究协会刊物《经济札记》七月号登载，美国最近八年来在海外直接投资的全部价值已差不多增加了一倍，达到一百三十亿美元。这些直接投资的利润之大，美国商务部曾加以说明：“直接对外投资价值的增加，大部分是出自分公司和子公司的未经分配的利润的再投资，而且外流资本的大部分也是从一九四八年和一九四九年国外所获得的收入中得来的，国外的分公司和子公司所取得的收入总计，几乎等于由美国母公司外流的全部资金。”
    华尔街垄断资本家在国外的金元就像一个愈滚愈大的雪球一样，而它上面却沾满着附庸国与殖民地人民的鲜血。
  “非美活动委员会”的西德支会
    西德波恩傀儡政府最近计划仿照美国的“非美活动委员会”设立一个“非联邦共和国委员会”，它有权剥夺一切被指为“非联邦共和国”的人民，并可以实施到任何与德意志民主共和国内任何个人和组织保持关系的人的身上。议员虽有特权，但他们也要受这个委员会的权力的管辖。
    这个“委员会”实际上就是“非美活动委员会”的一个支会，因为它所要对付的乃是有“非美活动”的德国爱好和平、民主的人民。
