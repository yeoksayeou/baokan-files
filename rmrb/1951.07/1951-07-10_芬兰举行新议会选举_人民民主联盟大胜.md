　　Finnish New Parliamentary Elections Held
    People's Democratic League Achieves Major Victory
    [Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, 9th] News: The Finnish People's Democratic League achieved a major victory in the Finnish 13th parliamentary elections held on July 2nd and 3rd. According to the election results that have now been revealed, the Finnish People's Democratic League, composed of the Finnish Communist Party and the Unified Socialist Party, won 45 seats in the new parliament, an increase of seven seats compared to the 12th parliamentary elections in July 1948, accounting for 22.5 percent of all 200 seats in the parliament. The People's Democratic League's vote also increased significantly, and Mr. Kuusinen, chairman of the League's parliamentary group, was the member of parliament who received the most votes in the election. However, without exception, the seats and votes of the remaining major parties in Finland all declined, with the most severe decline being the Coalition Party (Conservative Party), which lost 70,000 votes and seven seats, occupying only 26 seats in the new parliament. In addition, the seat distribution is as follows: Social Democratic Party: 53 seats, a decrease of one seat compared to the previous parliament; Agrarian League: 52 seats, a decrease of four seats. The other two smaller parties—the Swedish People's Party and the People's Party (formerly the Liberal Party)—won a total of 24 seats, an increase of five seats compared to the previous parliament (which won a total of 19 seats).
    Before this election, under the instigation of the United States, the Finnish reactionaries attempted to imitate the methods of the French and Italian reactionaries to amend the election law in order to reduce the People's Democratic League's seats in parliament to a minimum. However, under the opposition of the people, the conspiracy to amend the election law failed. Later, during the election campaign, the Finnish reactionaries exhausted all means of fabricating rumors and slander against the People's Democratic League, and at the same time openly nominated figures like the war criminal Donner as candidates. However, the election results proved that the Finnish people are increasingly dissatisfied with the war policy pursued by the Finnish reactionaries, and support the Finnish People's Democratic League, whose election program is: to fight for peace and democracy, to fight for strengthening Finnish-Soviet relations, to fight for improving the living conditions of the working people and abolishing the exploitation power of big capitalists.

　　芬兰举行新议会选举
    人民民主联盟大胜
    【新华社九日讯】赫尔辛基消息：芬兰人民民主联盟在七月二日和三日举行的芬兰第十三届议会选举中，获得了巨大的胜利。根据现已揭晓的选举结果，由芬兰共产党和统一社会党组成的芬兰人民民主联盟，在新议会中获得了四十五个议席，比一九四八年七月第十二届议会选举时增加达七席，占议会全部二百个议席的百分之二十二点五。人民民主联盟的选票亦有显著增加，该盟议会党团主席库西宁是选举中获得选票最多的议员。但是，芬兰其余各大党的议席和选票都无例外地下跌，其中跌得最惨重的是联合党（保守党），失去选票达七万票，议席达七席，在新议会中仅占二十六席。此外议席分配为：社会民主党：五十三席，较上届议会减少一席；农民联盟：五十二席，减少四席。其他两小党——瑞典人民党和人民党（即以前的自由党）共得二十四席，较上届议会（共得十九席）增加五席。
    在这次选举以前，芬兰反动派在美国指使下，曾企图仿效法国和意大利反动派的手法，修改选举法，以便把人民民主联盟在议会中的议席减低到最低限度，但是，在人民的反对下，修改选举法的阴谋未能得逞。后来，在竞选期间，芬兰反动派又对人民民主联盟竭尽造谣诬蔑之能事，同时又公然提出战犯唐纳这样的人物为候选人。但是，选举的结果证明，芬兰人民已越来越不满芬兰反动派所奉行的战争政策，而拥护芬兰人民民主联盟，这一盟联的竞选纲领是：为和平、民主而斗争，为加强芬苏邦交而斗争，为改善劳动人民的生活条件和取消大资本家的剥削势力而斗争。
