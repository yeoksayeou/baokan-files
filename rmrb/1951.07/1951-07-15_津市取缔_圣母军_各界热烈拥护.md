Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 14th -- Following the Tianjin Military Control Commission's order on the 13th banning the "Legion of Mary," a secret reactionary organization within the Catholic Church, leading figures from various democratic parties and people's organizations in the city, as well as Catholic figures and faculty and students from various church schools, have expressed their enthusiastic support.

Ling Mianzhi, a member of the Preparatory Committee of the Tianjin Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said: "The Legion of Mary" is one of the most insidious tools used by imperialist groups under the guise of religion. Imperialists are actively using this international secret fascist organization to engage in their death throes. The Tianjin Military Control Commission's measure to ban this reactionary organization is extremely correct, fully in line with the demands of the broad masses of the people, and is enthusiastically supported by the people.

Wang Zhenhua, a member of the Provisional Working Committee of the Tianjin Branch of the China Democratic League, said: I firmly support this wise measure by the government. These chief culprits who willingly act as accomplices of tigers should be severely suppressed in accordance with the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries" to thoroughly eliminate this reactionary secret organization, so that the good Catholics in China will no longer be deceived and misled by these imperialist elements.

Li Zhuchen, Chairman of the Tianjin Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said: "The Legion of Mary" was only organized in Tianjin on the eve of liberation, which shows how meticulously the imperialists were plotting to carry out sabotage work in the People's China. Now, it is hoped that those who have been deceived into joining this reactionary organization will quickly register or withdraw from the "Legion" and should try their best to expose the crimes of the "Legion of Mary" to completely destroy this reactionary organization.

Wang Laowu, Vice Chairman of the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions, said: Our 400,000 workers in Tianjin sincerely thank the Military Control Commission for this wise measure. We hope that any workers who have been deceived into joining the "Legion of Mary" should quickly declare their withdrawal from this reactionary organization and expose its criminal activities.

The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the Tianjin Democratic Youth Federation, and the Tianjin Student Federation jointly issued a statement saying: "The Legion of Mary" uses fascist means to severely rule "members," conducts reactionary activities, and is hostile to the people and the People's Government. We cannot tolerate its continued existence. We call on the city's Youth League members, the broad masses of youth, and students to help the "Legion of Mary members" around them to recognize the reactionary nature of the "Legion of Mary" so that they can confess and register with the government or declare their withdrawal. Yang Shixian, Chairman of the Tianjin Educational Workers' Union, said: The Tianjin Military Control Commission's banning of the reactionary organization "Legion of Mary" not only conforms to the interests of the Chinese people but also conforms to the interests of Catholics. This is precisely the necessary measure to protect the freedom of religious belief of Catholics in the New China.

Faculty and students from Tianjin University, Sheng Gong Girls' High School, and other schools also held rallies to accuse the "Legion of Mary" of its crimes. Wu Kezhai, Director of the Tianjin Catholic Reform Movement Promotion Association, Catholic priests Li Depei and Liu Pinyi, Tianjin University Vice President Li Baozhen, Vice Principal of Fa-Han School Nie Guoping, Principal of Sheng Gong Girls' High School Fan Enkun, Principal of Xikai High School Shi Yi, and others have published articles in various newspapers, resolutely supporting this legitimate measure of the People's Government.

　　津市取缔“圣母军”
    各界热烈拥护
    【新华社天津十四日电】天津市军事管制委员会于十三日发布命令，宣布取缔天主教内的秘密反动组织“圣母军”后，本市各民主党派、人民团体负责人及天主教人士、各教会学校师生一致表示热烈拥护。
    中国国民党革命委员会天津分部筹备委员会委员凌勉之说：“圣母军”是帝国主义集团以宗教作为掩护的最阴险的工具之一，帝国主义者积极利用这一国际性的秘密法西斯组织来进行垂死的挣扎。天津市军事管制委员会取缔这一反动组织的措施是非常正确的，极符合广大人民的要求，更为人民所热烈拥护。
    中国民主同盟天津市支部临时工作委员会委员王振华说：我坚决拥护政府这一英明措施。对这些甘心为虎作伥的首恶，应当按“中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例”给以严厉镇压，彻底消灭这个反动秘密组织，使中国的善良教徒不再受这些帝国主义分子的欺骗和蒙蔽。
    民主建国会天津分会主任委员李烛尘说：“圣母军”在天津是解放前夕才组织成立的，足见帝国主义如何处心积虑地阴谋在人民中国进行破坏工作。现在，希望被骗参加这个反动组织的人员赶快办理登记或退“团”，并且应该尽量揭露“圣母军”的罪行，彻底摧毁这一反动组织。
    天津市总工会副主席王老五说：我们天津市四十万职工衷心感谢军事管制委员会的这一英明措施。希望职工中有被骗加入“圣母军”的，应迅速声明退出该反动组织，并揭发它的罪恶活动。
    中国新民主主义青年团天津市工作委员会、天津市民主青年联合会、天津市学生联合会联合发表声明说：“圣母军”用法西斯手段严厉统治“团员”，进行反动活动，与人民为敌，与人民政府为敌，我们万不能容忍它继续存在。我们号召全市的青年团员，广大青年和学生，帮助周围的“圣母军团员”认识“圣母军”的反动本质，使他们向政府坦白登记或声明退出。天津市教育工会主席杨石先说：天津市军事管制委员会取缔反动组织“圣母军”，不但符合中国人民的利益，同时也符合天主教徒的利益，这正是保障新中国的天主教徒信仰自由的必要措施。
    津沽大学、圣功女中等校师生并举行集会，控诉“圣母军”的罪行。天津市天主教革新运动促进会主任委员吴克斋、天主教神父李德培、刘品一，津沽大学副校长李宝震、法汉学校副校长聂国屏、圣功女中校长范恩锟、西开中学校长史易等，都在各报发表文章，坚决拥护人民政府这一正当措施。
