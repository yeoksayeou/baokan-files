Response to People's Daily Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions:

To the Editors:

After the People's Daily on April 18th and the Workers' Daily on April 14th published criticisms of the Tangshan Steel Plant for not paying enough attention to labor protection, the plant's administrative leadership and the responsible comrades of the trade union both believed that the newspaper's criticisms were correct. They immediately convened a factory management committee to study improvements to the plant's safety and sanitation equipment, and temporarily formed a committee to improve ventilation equipment, specifically responsible for solving the plant's most serious ventilation problems. At the same time, since the newspaper's criticism, the relationship between the plant's administration and the trade union has become closer. The Central Ministry of Heavy Industry sent four of us to the plant, together with relevant parties, to inspect their acceptance of the criticism and improvement work. We are now informing you of our understanding of the plant's improvements in safety and sanitation.

(1) Regarding ventilation, many of the windows in the rolling mill plant building could not be opened or closed originally. Now they have all been modified to be opened and closed freely, and 28 new large windows have been opened. In addition to sending people to the Huaxin Textile Factory to learn about automatic window opening and closing devices, the plant also plans to send people to the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant in Northeast China to learn about blower installation. The converters in the steelmaking plant have all had their chimneys enlarged, and the workshops are no longer filled with carbon monoxide. They are now working on repairing the roof, opening up larger vents, and removing hot slag. Water spray pipes have been installed inside the plant to regularly spray water and keep the ground moist. Methods will also be devised to remove red ingots. Part of the surrounding windbreak walls and buildings are being planned for demolition. Since April, the foundry has replaced smelly oil bricks with bittern bricks for building electric furnaces, and the skylights that could not be opened have been removed, so the room is no longer filled with fumes. The electric furnace and the ingot casting pool in the department are too close together. When charging materials, the loading workers are subjected to high heat radiation from the steel ingots. Preparations have been made to move the position of the ingot casting pool.

(2) Regarding workers' protective equipment, the rolling mill stipulates that each worker be issued a mask every ten days, and work clothes are replaced when torn. Workers operating on the furnace can borrow glasses. Because the ground in the rolling mill's operating room is often splashed with water, workers' feet are easily damaged when wearing cloth shoes. High-top leather boots have now been issued to the workers to prevent burns and water damage. In the past, the steelmaking department had two types of gloves, one six inches long and the other one and a half feet long. Now an eight-inch glove has been added to solve the problem of hand burns due to short gloves. In addition, workers are issued wooden-soled shoes, goggles, fire-watching glasses, pointed straw hats, wicker hats, work clothes, masks, leggings and other protective equipment as needed.

(3) Regarding the cleanliness of the workshops, each department has divided into shifts to clean up according to the work area during shift changes, rotating once a week. The waste slag accumulated in the steelmaking department in the past has now been completely removed; however, the molten steel troughs and tools on the workshop floor are still not neatly placed. The foundry has a lot of accumulated finished products, sandboxes, and waste slag, which cannot be sorted out in time due to insufficient cranes. Other problems include too few toolboxes, and some tools are still placed haphazardly.

(4) In the past, there were few and dirty toilets in the plant. Now the rolling mill has built two new flush toilets; new-style toilets are planned to be built near the foundry and the steelmaking department.

(5) The steelmaking, foundry, and rolling mill departments all have locker rooms, but some are too small and some are very unclean. We have suggested that the plant find ways to improve them.

(6) Drinking water. The plant uses river water, and the filtration is rudimentary. According to doctors' examinations, the water contains many intestinal bacteria. This problem needs to be well resolved after a large filter pool is added. At present, drinking water and general-purpose water will be separated first, the water system will be sorted out, and the drinking water will be processed and filtered.

(7) Regarding food heating equipment, a new boiler room has been built in the rolling mill, with two steamers inside, for workers who bring food from home to heat their food. The remaining departments will continue to install food heating equipment.

In general, the plant has made great improvements in labor protection after accepting newspaper criticism. However, some problems involve the plant's inherent construction issues. Although efforts have been made to improve and remedy them, they cannot be completely resolved at once. The problem of eliminating carbon monoxide in the steelmaking department is such an example. Secondly, the plant's safety education for workers was not done well enough in the past and should continue to be strengthened in the future.

### 唐山钢铁厂安全卫生设备已有改进

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　唐山钢铁厂安全卫生设备已有改进编辑同志：
    四月十八日人民日报和四月十四日工人日报发表了对唐山钢铁厂不重视劳动保护的批评以后，该厂行政领导方面及工会负责同志都认为报纸的批评是正确的，当即召开了工厂管理委员会，研究改进厂内的安全卫生设备，并临时组成了改进通风设备的委员会，专门负责解决该厂最严重的通风设备问题。同时，自报纸批评以后，该厂行政与工会的关系也更密切了。中央重工业部曾派我们四人会同有关方面至该厂检查他们接受批评改进工作的情形，现把我们所了解的该厂改进安全卫生的情况告诉你们。
    （一）关于通风问题，该厂轧钢部厂房的窗户原来多不能开关，现均已改装，可以自由开关，并新开大窗户二十八个。厂部除已派人到华新纺织工厂学习窗户自动开关装置外，并打算派人到东北鞍山钢铁厂学习吹风机的装置。炼钢部转炉烟囱均已改大，车间已不再弥漫一氧化炭。现正着手修理屋顶，开大排风口，并运出热渣。厂房内已按设喷水管，以便经常喷水，保持地面湿润。红钢锭也要设法运出。四围挡风墙及房屋正计划拆除一部。四月份起铸造部已改用卤水砖代替臭油砖砌电炉，并将不能开关的天窗拆除，因此室内已不再充满油烟。该部的电炉和造块池相距太近，装料工人在装料时受着钢锭高热的辐射，已准备移动造块池的位置。
    （二）关于工人的防护用品，轧钢部规定每十天发给每个工人口罩一个，工作服穿破即换发，在炉上操作的工人，可以借用眼镜。轧钢机操作室因地面经常淋水，工人着用布鞋足部易于受损，现已发给工人高筒皮靴，以便防烫防水。炼钢部以前手套分为两种，一为六寸的，一为一尺半的，现增加八寸的一种，以解决因手套短发生烫手的问题。此外并按需要发给工人木底鞋、风镜、看火眼镜、尖顶草帽、柳条帽、工作服、口罩、裹腿等防护用品。
    （三）关于车间的清洁问题，各部均已依照工作地段，在交接班时分班清扫，每周轮换一次。炼钢部过去积存的废渣子，现已完全运出；但车间地面上的流钢水槽及工具等放置还不整齐。铸造部堆积的成品、沙箱及废渣等很多，因吊车不够用，不能及时整理。其他如工具箱太少，工具放置还有些零乱。
    （四）过去厂内厕所少而脏，现轧钢部已新建两个冲洗式厕所；铸造部和炼钢部附近均计划建筑新式厕所。
    （五）炼钢部、铸造部及轧钢部均有更衣室，但有的太小，有的很不清洁，我们已建议该厂设法改善。
    （六）饮水问题。该厂所吃的是河水，过滤简陋，据医生检查，水内含有很多肠菌。此问题需要在添造大滤水池以后才能很好地解决。目前先将饮水和一般用水分开，整理水系，对饮水加工过滤。
    （七）关于饮食加热设备，轧钢部已新建锅房一处，里边设置了蒸锅两个，以供从家里带饭的工人将食物加热之用。其余各部也将继续设置热饭设备。
    总起来说，该厂在接受报纸批评以后，劳动保护方面已有了很大的改进，但是，有一些问题，因为牵涉到工厂固有的建设问题，虽然努力作了改进和补救，一时还不能得到彻底的解决。例如炼钢部排除一氧化炭的问题就是这样的。其次，该厂工人的安全教育，过去做得很不够，今后应该继续加强。
