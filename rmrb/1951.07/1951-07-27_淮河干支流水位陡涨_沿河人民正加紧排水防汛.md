　　The water levels of the main and tributary rivers of the Huai River have risen sharply.
　　People along the river are stepping up drainage and flood prevention.
    Since mid-July, there has been widespread rainfall in the Huai River basin, causing mountain torrents. As a result, the water levels of the Huai River's mainstream and tributaries have risen sharply. Some low-lying areas in Henan and northern Anhui have suffered from waterlogging due to insufficient drainage. Flood control headquarters in various regions are now leading the people along the river in intense drainage and flood prevention work.
    From the 10th to the 13th of this month, the Huoshan County area in the Pishi River basin, a tributary of the Huai River, received a total rainfall of 232.4 millimeters. The water level of the Pishi River also rose sharply to 37.8 meters during the same period, exceeding the highest water level in 1950. On the 18th and 19th, there was widespread rainfall in the Huai River basin. On the 20th, the water level of the Hong River, a tributary of the upper reaches of the Huai River, surged by 6.15 meters. The water level of the Huai River's mainstream near Xixian County in Henan also surged by 5.6 meters, and the water level of the Ying River, a tributary in the middle reaches, rose by 2.3 meters. On the 23rd, the flood peak reached Zhengyangguan in northern Anhui, where the Huai River's water level surged, exceeding the flood alert level there. Currently, 180,000 mu of farmland in some areas along the Pishi River have been waterlogged, and 80,600 mu of lake area in Suxian, Sixian, Sihong, Lingbi, and Wuhe counties in the Suxian area of northern Anhui have been flooded. 300,000 mu of farmland have accumulated water in Zhengyang and other counties in Henan Province, in the upper reaches of the Huai River. At present, the flood control headquarters in the above-mentioned areas have mobilized a large number of people to the dikes, guarding them day and night, while mobilizing farmers to intensify drainage to save seedlings and replant.

　　淮河干支流水位陡涨
　  沿河人民正加紧排水防汛
    本月中旬以来，淮河流域各地普遍降雨，山洪暴发，淮河干河和支河的水位因此陡涨，河南、皖北的部分洼地已因排水不及，内涝成灾。各地防汛指挥机关现正领导沿河人民投入紧张的排水和防汛工作。
    本月十日至十三日淮河支流渒河流域霍山县一带，共降雨二三二点四公厘，渒河水位也于同时期内陡涨至三十七点八公尺，超过一九五零年最高水位。十八、十九两日，淮河流域普遍降雨。二十日，淮河上游支流洪河水位猛涨六点一五公尺，河南息县一带淮河干流的水位亦猛涨五点六公尺，中游支流颍河的水位涨二点三公尺。二十三日，洪水峰到达皖北正阳关，该处淮河水位猛涨，超过该处的设防水位。现在渒河两岸部分地区遭受内涝的田已达十八万亩，皖北宿县专区的宿县、泗县、泗洪、灵璧、五河等县有八万零六百亩湖地受淹，淮河上游河南省的正阳等县亦有三十万亩农田积水。目前，上述地区的防汛指挥机关已动员了大批人工上堤，昼夜守护堤防，同时发动农民加紧排水救苗和补种。（新华社）
