Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: Chairman Huang Guo Viet of the Vietnamese People's Delegation to China delivered the following reply speech at the welcoming ceremony:

Vice Chairman Li of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, distinguished representatives, comrades:

On behalf of the Vietnamese People's Delegation to China, I sincerely thank you all. In this first minute of meeting with you, who are so close and joyful, I am deeply excited.

First of all, I would like to convey President Ho Chi Minh's cordial respect and greetings to Chairman Mao, the Central People's Government, all democratic parties, people's organizations, and the entire Chinese people. President Ho repeatedly instructed us to do this when we set out.

President Ho, the Viet Minh Front, and the Vietnamese people have sent us to visit China. Our task is to report to the Chinese people on the long and arduous resistance of the Vietnamese people under the leadership of President Ho and the Vietnamese Labor Party, to strengthen the original friendship between our two peoples. At the same time, we must strive to learn from China's valuable experience in order to widely disseminate it back home and strengthen our resistance forces.

Comrades, thanks to the care of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Central People's Government, we have received thoughtful and warm hospitality from the heads of local governments and people's organizations in China as soon as we crossed the border. We are very excited to see the vigorous development of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and the great achievements of the Chinese people in supporting the Chinese People's Volunteers with donations of aircraft and artillery. It strengthens our confidence that the Chinese people, the Korean people, and the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, General Kim Il-sung, and President Ho Chi Minh, will achieve complete victory.

We hope that this visit will further enhance the friendly unity between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples, and under the leadership of Marshal Stalin, actively participate in the struggle to defend world peace and democracy.

Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!

Long live President Ho Chi Minh!

Long live the unity of the Chinese and Vietnamese people!

Long live Marshal Stalin!

    【新华社二十三日讯】越南人民访华代表团团长黄国越在欢迎会上的答词如下：
    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会李副主席，各位代表，各位同志：
    我谨代表越南人民访华代表团，诚敬地感谢诸位，在和你们这样亲密而欢欣地见面的头一分钟，我深为兴奋。
    我首先要转达胡志明主席向毛主席、中央人民政府、各民主党派、人民团体及全体中国人民的亲密敬意和问候。这是胡主席在我们启程时再四叮嘱我们的。
    胡主席、越联战线及越南人民委派我们前来访问中国，我们的任务是向中国人民报告越南人民在胡主席及越南劳动党领导下长期艰苦抗战的情形，来增强我们中越两国人民原有的友谊。同时，我们要努力学习中国的宝贵经验，以便回国普遍传达，来增强我们的抗战力量。
    各位同志，由于中国人民政治协商会议及中央人民政府的关照，我们一踏过边界，就得到中国各地方政府诸位首长及人民团体周到和殷勤的招待。我们路经各地，看见抗美援朝运动的蓬勃发展以及中国人民拥护中国人民志愿军捐献飞机大炮运动的伟大成绩，我们感到非常兴奋，并且加强了对中国人民、朝鲜人民及越南人民在毛主席、金日成将军和胡主席领导下获得完全胜利的信心。
    我们希望这次访问更能增进中国人民与越南人民间的友好团结，并在斯大林大元帅的领导下，积极参加保卫世界和平、民主的斗争。
    毛泽东主席万岁！
    胡志明主席万岁！
    中越两国人民团结万岁！
    斯大林大元帅万岁！
