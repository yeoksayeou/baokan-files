Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 6th: Dr. Saifuddin, Chairman of the All India Peace Council, met with a reporter from this agency and made a statement on the issue of signing a peace treaty with Japan, stating: "Our goal should be to make Japan a free, democratic, and peaceful country again as soon as possible. Today's Japan is not an independent country; it is occupied by the United States. Its current government is completely controlled by the Americans, who are using Japanese territory and resources to achieve their own goals. The United States has occupied Japan for more than five years; for Japan's independence and for peace in the Far East, this occupation must end quickly. To achieve this goal, a peace treaty must be concluded with Japan quickly, and the occupying forces must withdraw from Japan. The treaty must guarantee that Japan becomes an independent, democratic, and peaceful country. The treaty must safeguard the democratic rights of the Japanese people and the free development of Japan's peaceful economy. Given Japan's history of aggression against its neighbors, the treaty can and must strictly limit the size of Japan's armed forces. Japan's armed forces should never be allowed to exceed what is needed for self-defense. Japanese militarism must not be allowed to revive. Furthermore, Japan must guarantee that no foreign country stations troops or maintains military bases in Japan, and Japan must guarantee that it will not participate in any alliance aimed at opposing countries that sent troops and fought fascist Japan. If a peace treaty is concluded on this basis, I believe it would be a great contribution to maintaining peace in Asia."

The reporter then asked him about the United States' attempts to separately conclude peace with Japan and re-arm Japan. The questions and answers were as follows:

Q: What are your views on the US government's attempt to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan?

A: This attempt is doomed to failure. Any peace treaty with Japan must be signed not only by the United States, Britain, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union, but also by all countries that sent troops and fought Japan. The United States intends to exclude the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China from the peace treaty with Japan. But that is impossible. First, doing so would clearly violate some international agreements that the US government participated in signing, such as the Cairo Declaration, the Yalta Agreement, and the Potsdam Proclamation. Second, if any major power like the Soviet Union or the People's Republic of China is excluded from the peace treaty, how can this treaty be effective? The Chinese people resisted Japanese aggression for the longest period of time and made significant sacrifices in the cause of defeating Japanese militarism. How can the voices of 500 million Chinese people be ignored? A peace treaty with Japan is worthless without the approval of the Chinese people. Even if the US government obtains the support of the remnants of the Kuomintang group in Taiwan, who are now hiding behind American warships, it will not change the situation. The Kuomintang group has lost all right to speak for the Chinese people. Everyone with a clear head recognizes that only the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China can represent the Chinese people. I would like to state clearly: The Indian people do not recognize any peace treaty with Japan that excludes the People's Republic of China. The All India Peace Conference recently held in Bombay condemned the occupying countries' attempts to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan, and this is the voice of India. India is a major country in Asia and plays an important role in today's world situation. The Indian peace movement demands that the drafting of a peace treaty with Japan must be attended not only by People's China and the Soviet Union, but also by other countries that sent troops and fought Japan.

Q: What are your views on the re-arming of Japan that the United States is carrying out, and what impact does this re-arming action have on the interests of the Indian people?

A: India has expressed its firm opposition to any action to re-arm Japan. First, the Prime Minister of India has publicly opposed the re-arming of Japan. Second, the All India Peace Conference held in Bombay from May 11th to 13th strongly condemned the occupying countries' work of remilitarizing Japan in violation of the will of the Japanese people and international agreements. The conference declared that this re-militarization is a threat to the peace and freedom of the people of all Asian countries (including the Japanese people).

Dr. Saifuddin then explained the position of the Indian peace movement, saying: "Millions of people in several Asian countries have suffered terrible pain at the hands of Japanese militarists. They will never forget the barbaric atrocities committed by Japanese invaders in the occupied areas. We in India have also suffered under Japanese aggression. We are also fully aware of the suffering of the people of other Asian countries - especially the Chinese people - at the hands of Japanese militarists. Today's re-arming of Japan is aimed at Asian countries; the Asian people must stop the re-arming of Japan. This re-arming is not for the benefit of the Japanese people themselves. If the Japanese people want to live in peace and friendship with their neighbors, they must bury Japanese militarism and resolutely oppose the occupying countries' plan to rebuild Japan as a military base. Japan cannot benefit from this re-militarization plan in any way. But if Japan develops into a peaceful and democratic country and establishes friendly relations with its Asian neighbors - first and foremost China - it will reap boundless benefits."

　　全印和平理事会主席谈话
    认为草拟对日和约  中苏两国必须参加
    印度人民坚决反对重新武装日本
    【新华社新德里六日电】全印和平理事会主席赛福丁博士接见本社记者，就签订对日和约问题发表谈话称：“我们的目标应当是尽快使日本重新成为独立、民主与和平的国家。今天的日本不是独立的国家，它被美国占领了。它目前的政府完全掌握在美国人手里，美国人正在利用日本的领土和资源达到他们自己的目的。美国占领日本已有五年多；为了日本的独立，为了远东的和平，必须迅速结束这种占领。要达到这个目的，就必须迅速与日本缔结和约，占领军必须从日本撤退。和约必须保证使日本成为独立、民主与和平的国家。和约必须保障日本人民的民主权利和日本和平经济的自由发展。鉴于日本以往侵略它的邻国的历史，和约可以而且必须对日本武装力量的规模加以严格限制。决不容许日本武装力量超过自卫的需要。不应当让日本军国主义复活。此外，必须使日本保证不让任何外国在日本驻扎军队或保有军事基地，必须使日本保证不参加以反对曾派军队和法西斯日本作战的任何国家为目的的联盟。如果在这个基础上缔结和约，我认为这对维持亚洲和平是一个巨大的贡献。”
    记者接着向他提出关于美国企图单独对日媾和与重新武装日本的问题。问答如下：
    问：您对美国政府打算与日本缔结单独和约的企图有什么意见？
    答：这种企图是注定要失败的。任何对日和约不但必须由美国、英国、中华人民共和国和苏联签字，而且必须由曾派军队和日本作战的一切国家签字。美国打算把苏联和中华人民共和国摈斥于对日和约之外。但是那是不可能的。第一，这样做显然将违背美国政府参加签订的一些国际协定，如开罗宣言、雅尔塔协定、波茨坦公告等。第二，如果任何像苏联或中华人民共和国那样的大国被排斥于和约之外，那末，这个和约怎能有效呢？中国人民反抗日本的侵略历时最久，在战胜日本军国主义的事业中付出了重大的牺牲。怎能对五亿之众的中国人民的声音置之不理呢？对日和约如果得不到中国人民的批准，就毫无价值可言。即使美国政府得到现在躲在美国军舰背后的台湾的国民党残余集团的支持，也不能使情况有所改变。国民党集团已丧失代表中国人民发言的一切权利。每一个头脑清醒的人都承认，只有中华人民共和国中央人民政府才能代表中国人民。我愿意明白地说：印度人民不承认把中华人民共和国排斥在外的任何对日和约。最近在孟买举行的全印和平大会，曾斥责占领国打算与日本缔结单独和约的企图，这是印度的声音。印度是亚洲的一个大国，在今天的世界局势中起着重要的作用。印度和平运动要求：草拟对日和约的工作，不但必须有人民中国和苏联参加，而且必须有曾派军队和日本作战的其他国家参加。
    问：您对美国正在进行的重新武装日本一事的看法如何，这种重新武装的行动对印度人民的利益有怎样的影响？
    答：印度曾表示坚决反对任何重新武装日本的行动。第一，印度总理曾公开反对重新武装日本。第二，五月十一日至十三日在孟买举行的全印和平大会，曾坚决斥责占领国违背日本人民意志和国际协定而进行的使日本重新军国主义化的工作。大会宣称：这种重新军国主义化对所有亚洲国家的人民（包括日本人民在内）的和平与自由是一种威胁。
    赛福丁博士继即解释印度和平运动的立场说：“亚洲若干国家的千百万人民，曾在日本军国主义者手中遭受到可怖的痛苦。他们永远不会忘记日本侵略者在其占领地区犯下的野蛮暴行。我们印度也同样在日本侵略下遭受了痛苦。我们也充分了解亚洲其他国家的人民——特别是中国人民——在日本军国主义者手中受到的痛苦。今天的重新武装日本是针对着亚洲国家的；亚洲人民必须阻止日本的重新武装。这种重新武装并不是为了日本人民自己的利益。如果日本人民希望与他们的邻国和平友好共处，他们必须把日本军国主义埋葬掉，并坚决反对占领国家把日本重建为军事基地的计划。日本并不能从这种重新军国主义化的计划中获得任何好处。但如果日本发展成为一个和平民主的国家并与其亚洲邻国——首先是中国——建立友好关系的话，那末它就会获得无穷的裨益。”
