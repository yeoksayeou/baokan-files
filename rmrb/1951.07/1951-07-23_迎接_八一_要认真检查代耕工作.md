　　To Welcome "August 1st", Conscientiously Inspect the Work of Substitute Tilling
    Since the beginning of this spring, with the deepening of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, all parts of the country have universally inspected the work of substitute tilling, and improved the system of substitute tilling for the land of revolutionary martyrs and military dependents. During the spring plowing and summer harvest, many difficulties in the production and life of revolutionary martyrs and military dependents were resolved, which played an important role in encouraging the frontline soldiers to kill the enemy and boosting the morale of unity and production in the rear. However, the phenomenon of neglecting the work of substitute tilling still exists seriously in many areas. The leading cadres of party organizations and government organs in these areas have not educated the people to regard doing a good job in substitute tilling as the people's obligation to the motherland, but simply tried to solve the difficulties for the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel, resulting in deviations from politics and from the masses, carrying out the work of substitute tilling in isolation. In the preferential treatment and substitute tilling work in the Southwest Region, it was discovered that some places in Qu County in eastern Sichuan and Hongya County in western Sichuan even turned the substitute tilling teams into "forced labor teams," forcibly forming substitute tilling teams with landlords, bullies, reformed bandits, hooligans, and even so-called "backward farmers who fail to attend meetings." In the old liberated areas, according to a survey of the entire province of Shanxi and 13 counties including Xingtai in Hebei, the use of temporary labor assignment methods for substitute tilling in rural areas still accounts for 20 percent of all villages. This wastes both the people's labor and easily neglects the land. The masses regard the work of substitute tilling as an extra burden. The reason for these deviations is mainly that some cadres put the work of substitute tilling in opposition to other central tasks, thinking that "in order to grasp the key points and complete the tasks, the work of preferential treatment has to be ignored," and therefore they can only temporarily "draw people to help." They do not understand that doing a good job in substitute tilling is a concrete task to strengthen the resistance against U.S. aggression and aid Korea, to support the front lines, and to strive for victory. Therefore, they have neglected political education for the masses, mobilizing and organizing the masses to carry out preferential treatment work. As a result, the work of substitute tilling has encountered unnecessary difficulties.
    The General Association to Resist America, Aid Korea calls on all localities to conscientiously inspect the work of preferential treatment once in the week before and after "August 1st". In rural areas, the focus of inspecting preferential treatment work is the work of substitute tilling. Leading organs in various localities should extensively carry out education on loving the motherland and loving the army, and mobilize the masses to inspect the work of substitute tilling in various localities. Promote the inclusion of doing a good job in substitute tilling into the patriotic pacts by the peasants, and establish fixed systems for substitute tilling and inspection. Commemorating the August 1st Army Day in rural areas should include inspecting and improving the work of substitute tilling for the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel as an important item.

### 迎接“八一”要认真检查代耕工作

　　迎接“八一”要认真检查代耕工作
    今春以来，随着抗美援朝运动的深入开展，全国各地普遍检查了代耕工作，改进了对烈属军属土地的代耕制度。在春耕夏收中，解决了许多烈属军属在生产和生活上的困难，对于鼓舞前线将士杀敌斗志和巩固后方团结生产的情绪，都起了重要作用。但是，忽视代耕工作的现象在很多地区仍然严重地存在着。这些地区党组织和政府机关的领导工作者没有把做好代耕工作当作人民对祖国应尽的义务去教育人民，而只是单纯设法给烈、军属解决困难，结果发生了脱离政治，脱离群众孤立地去搞代耕工作的偏向。在西南区的优属代耕工作中，发现川东渠县和川西洪雅县有些地方竟把代耕队搞成了“苦工队”，强迫地主、恶霸、自新土匪、二流子，甚至将所谓“开会不到的落后农民”组成代耕队。在老解放区，据山西全省和河北邢台等十三县的调查，在农村中用临时派工办法进行代耕的，仍占全部村庄的百分之二十。这样既浪费民力，又易荒芜土地。群众把代耕工作当作了一种额外的负担。产生这些偏向的原因，主要是有些干部把代耕工作和其他中心工作对立起来，认为“为了抓住重点完成任务，优抚工作只好不管”，因而也就只好临时“抽人帮忙”。他们不懂得：作好代耕工作，就是加强抗美援朝，支援前线争取胜利的一个具体的工作。因此，他们忽略了对群众进行政治教育，发动和组织群众进行优抚工作，结果，当然就使代耕工作遇到了不应有的困难。
    抗美援朝总会号召各地，在“八一”前后各一个星期要认真检查一次优抚工作。在农村中，检查优抚工作的重点，就是代耕工作。各地领导机关，应该广泛开展热爱祖国、热爱军队的教育，发动群众检查各地的代耕工作。推动农民把作好代耕工作一项，普遍地订到爱国公约中去，并且订出固定的代耕制度和检查制度。在农村中纪念八一建军节，应当把检查与改进对烈属军属的代耕工作作为一个重要项目。
