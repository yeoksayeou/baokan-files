　　Northeast's Experience in Organizing Urban Revolutionary Martyrs' Families for Production
　　By our special correspondents Zhang Panxin and Su Ji

　　Editor's Note: One of the main contents of urban preferential treatment work is to organize the families of revolutionary martyrs to participate in production and introduce them to employment. This is the most fundamental way to solve the difficulties in the lives of the families of revolutionary martyrs. The Northeast region has gained important experience in this regard, that is, first of all, to overcome the various incorrect ideas about preferential treatment work that exist among cadres, and to organize various production institutions according to the characteristics of different cities to absorb the families of revolutionary martyrs to participate in production. This experience is worth promoting and learning from.

(I)
　　The work of according preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary servicemen (hereinafter referred to as families of revolutionary martyrs) in cities in the Northeast region is carried out in accordance with the principle of "organizing production and introducing employment as the main task, and material subsidies as supplementary." In all places where this principle is conscientiously implemented, the difficulties in the lives and production of the families of revolutionary martyrs have been properly resolved. In the past, some cities focused on material subsidies, which made the preferential treatment work lag behind the rural areas, and the lives of some families of revolutionary martyrs failed to improve with the improvement of the people's living standards.

　　After the launch of the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the cadres of preferential treatment work and the broad masses of people in various places further recognized the importance of this work related to national defense construction. In March of this year, the Northeast held a regional conference of model representatives of revolutionary martyrs' families and support-the-army preferential treatment, which clearly put forward the principles of preferential treatment work, exchanged work experience, and studied ways to organize revolutionary martyrs' families to participate in production, so that the preferential treatment work has been further developed. According to the situation in Shenyang, Qiqihar, Mudanjiang, Fushun, Tumen, Baicheng, Keshan and other cities during this period, the main reason for the improvement of the preferential treatment work in various cities is that the cadres have changed their understanding of this work. In the past, some cadres in charge of preferential treatment work in some cities did not have a clear understanding of the principles of preferential treatment work or did not pay enough attention to preferential treatment work. It is manifested in: First, emphasizing passive subsidies: believing that there are no conditions for carrying out preferential treatment work in cities, which is not as good as rural areas with land and livestock; most of the families of revolutionary martyrs are not highly educated and lack production technology and knowledge, so it is difficult to organize them to produce and introduce them to employment, and only rely on material subsidies. For example, the cadres of preferential treatment work in Baicheng County reviewed and said: "In the past, we thought that the preferential treatment work in cities can only be done with money; if the higher authorities do not give money, there is no way!" Second, aiming too high and being unrealistic: believing that to organize them to produce, we must do it on a large scale, and small-scale production or temporary sideline production cannot solve the problem. A civil affairs assistant in Baizhen District once said: "What can a little bit do? We need to build a big factory to solve the problem." As a result, the big factory was not built, and the small-scale production was delayed. Third, understanding in principle that we should vigorously organize the families of revolutionary martyrs to produce and introduce them to employment, and also have patience, but not understanding that preferential treatment work is a social mutual assistance undertaking, and not knowing how to use the power of the masses, resulting in very little achievement. After the Northeast Regional Conference of Model Representatives of Revolutionary Martyrs' Families and Support-the-Army Preferential Treatment, the cadres of preferential treatment work in various places generally changed the above-mentioned ideas and practices, and began to recognize the favorable conditions for urban preferential treatment work: that is, with the development of urban economic construction, the prosperity of industry and commerce, the places that need labor are increasing day by day. And when carrying out specific work, it is necessary to start from the big picture and start from the small, gradually developing from small to large; and it is necessary to mobilize social forces and think of more ways to help the families of revolutionary martyrs to do a good job in production.

(II)
　　Due to the change in the ideological understanding of the cadres, the cities have all organized the families of revolutionary martyrs to participate in production according to the specific conditions of their localities. For example, the Huanggu District People's Government of Shenyang City has conscientiously studied the relevant instructions on preferential treatment work, and on the fourth day after the Northeast Regional Conference of Model Representatives of Revolutionary Martyrs' Families and Support-the-Army Preferential Treatment (March 16), it organized a temporary production institution for the families of revolutionary martyrs—the rope net tethered hemp processing factory. Eighty percent of those participating in production are women. In twenty-five days, each person earned 4,000 to 6,000 yuan per day, thereby reducing the government's subsidy to the families of revolutionary martyrs from 120 households to 80 households. In the mining area of Fushun City, in March, more than 120 families of revolutionary martyrs were organized to participate in coal mining in Wanghua and Xinfu districts, which solved their living difficulties. Bao Jingyang, a model of military families in Wanghua District, led 80 families of revolutionary martyrs to pick more than 700 tons of coal in 40 days. After paying wages and the mining bureau's commission, they also accumulated a preferential treatment fund and a preferential treatment welfare fund; they plan to strive to ensure that the preferential treatment work in the district does not require state expenditures in a short period of time. Xinan District has also established two laundry facilities (one has already started), washing clothes for single workers in factories and mines, and it is estimated that it can accommodate 200 people to work, which can solve the employment problems of most of the families of revolutionary martyrs in Xinan and Wanghua districts. The Tumen City Military Family Production Department organized four small workshops for sugar making, flour making, tofu, and bean sprouts, all of which are doing well. There are now 102 families of revolutionary martyrs working in the workshops. Learning sessions and life review sessions have been established to continuously improve the political consciousness and production enthusiasm of the families of revolutionary martyrs. In the Northeast, the preferential treatment work in various small cities has also been improved. For example, Taian County Urban District took 90 million yuan of funds from the military family store to set up a sack factory. The existing 45 female military family workers can earn 3,000 yuan per day; in the future, it can absorb more than 200 families of revolutionary martyrs to participate in work. The factory is operating very well, with sufficient raw materials and a wide sales market. There are many orders from outside. The factory can also use the profits to relieve the individual families of revolutionary martyrs who have living difficulties. In addition, because the government's civil affairs department and various production departments have good contacts, they have found many jobs for the families of revolutionary martyrs, such as picking beans for the grain company and planting trees for the farm, which solved the employment problems of 40 families of revolutionary martyrs, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized soldiers.

(III)
　　According to the past and present urban preferential treatment work in the Northeast region, the following experiences have been obtained:

　　First, to organize the production of urban revolutionary martyrs' families, we must determine the production plan according to the characteristics of different cities. Large and medium-sized cities should organize diverse and decentralized small-scale light industry and manual processing industry, centering on the production needs of factories and enterprises, and absorb revolutionary martyrs' families to participate in production; mining areas should organize processing or sideline production centering on industrial and mining production; small cities and urban areas should face the countryside and engage in small handicrafts or seasonal temporary sideline production. The practice of indiscriminately "mechanically copying" should be opposed. For example, some cities organize sack factories and make a lot of profits, but changing to another place may result in losses.

　　Second, the urban preferential treatment work, especially organizing the families of revolutionary martyrs to produce, must oppose the practice of not having long-term plans. The existing production organizations of revolutionary martyrs' families should also be planned to make them regular and standardized. In the past, many cities established stores or cooperated with state-owned stores to run consumer cooperatives to make profits in order to subsidize the lives of the families of revolutionary martyrs, which did not fundamentally solve the problem, and this should be quickly corrected. Recently, Siping City has changed such welfare organizations into construction companies, rice mills, or grass bag factories, which have absorbed 61 revolutionary martyrs' families, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized soldiers to participate in production, which is very correct.

　　Third, after the families of revolutionary martyrs participate in production and their lives are improved, the leadership must conscientiously help them study politics and culture. The practice of the Harbin Revolutionary Martyrs' Family Sack Factory and the recently established Tumen City Revolutionary Martyrs' Family Production Department is very good. On the one hand, it has improved the political consciousness of the revolutionary martyrs' families, and on the other hand, it has assisted the government, led the masses, and promoted various tasks.

　　Organizing the production of revolutionary martyrs' families is the main task of urban preferential treatment work. The key lies in giving play to the strength of the masses, relying on the masses to think of more ways, and everyone contributing money and efforts. Therefore, the organization of the support-the-army preferential treatment committee is particularly important. Recently, when some counties in Heilongjiang Province were reorganizing this organization, they absorbed personnel from cooperatives, tax bureaus, industry and commerce associations, factories, enterprises, hospitals, and representatives of the military and the masses to participate in the study of support-the-army preferential treatment work. This practice is worth promoting.

　　东北组织城市烈军属生产的经验
    本报特约记者　张盘新、苏蓟
    编者按：城市优抚工作的主要内容之一，是组织烈军属参加生产和介绍烈军属就业。这是解决烈军属生活困难的最根本的办法。东北区在这方面已取得了重要经验，即首先要克服干部中所存在的对优抚工作的各种不正确思想，并根据不同城市的特点，组织各种不同的生产机构，吸收烈军属参加生产。这个经验值得推广，值得各地学习。
  （一）
    东北区城市的优待革命烈士、革命军人家属（以下简称烈军属）的工作，是本着“组织生产、介绍职业为主，物质补助为辅”的方针进行的。凡是认真执行这一方针的地方，烈军属在生活、生产中的困难，都得到了适当的解决。过去有些城市曾偏重于物质补助，因而使优抚工作落后于农村，部分烈军属的生活未能随着群众生活水平的提高而提高。
    在抗美援朝运动开展后，各地优抚工作干部及广大群众，进一步认识了这一有关国防建设的工作的重要性。今年三月间，东北召开的全区烈军属、拥军优属模范代表会议上，又明确提出了优抚工作的方针，交流了工作经验，研究了组织烈军属生产的办法，这样就使优抚工作得到了进一步的开展。根据这一时期沈阳、齐齐哈尔、牡丹江、抚顺、图们、白城、克山等城市的情况来看，各城市的优抚工作得到改进的主要原因是因为干部对这一工作在认识上有了转变。过去部分城市的优抚工作干部，对优抚工作的方针认识得不够明确或对优抚工作不够重视。表现在：一、强调了消极的补助：认为在城市中进行优抚工作没有条件，不如农村有土地、有牲畜好办；烈军属多半文化程度不高，缺乏生产技术和知识，因此组织他们生产、介绍职业都有困难，只有依靠实物补助。如白城县优抚工作干部检讨说：“过去认为城市的优抚工作只有用钱办事；上级不给钱，就没有了办法！”二、好高鹜远，不实事求是：认为要组织他们生产就要大规模地搞，小规模的生产或临时性的副业生产不能解决问题。拜泉城区民政助理员曾说：“一星半点的能当啥？要搞个大工厂才解决问题。”结果大工厂没搞成，小规模的生产也耽误了。三、从道理上懂得了应该大力组织烈军属生产、给他们介绍职业，并且也有耐心，但不懂得优抚工作是社会互助事业，不会运用群众力量，结果成绩很小。在东北全区烈军属、拥军优属模范代表会议以后，各地优抚工作干部普遍转变了上述想法与做法，开始认识了城市优抚工作的有利条件：即随着城市经济建设事业的发展，工商业的繁荣，需要劳动力的地方一天比一天增多起来了。而具体进行工作时，又必须是从大处着眼、小处着手，由小到大逐步发展；并必须发动社会力量，多想办法，才能帮助烈军属把生产搞好。
  （二）
    由于干部思想认识的转变，各城市便都根据本地的具体情况组织了烈军属参加生产。如沈阳市皇姑区人民政府曾认真学习了有关优抚工作的指示，在东北区烈军属、拥军优属模范代表会议后的第四天（三月十六日），即组织了烈军属的临时生产机构——绳网拴麻加工厂。参加生产的百分之八十是妇女。二十五天中，每人每日得工资四千至六千元，从而使政府对烈军属的补助由一百二十户减至八十户。矿区抚顺市，三月间在望花、新抚两区共组织了一百二十余名烈军属参加了挖煤工作，解决了他们的生活困难。望花区军属模范包景阳领导八十名烈军属在四十天内拣煤七百多吨，除开支工资和矿务局提成外，还积累了一笔优抚基金和优抚福利金；他们计划在短时间内，争取做到本区优抚工作不用国家开支。新安区并成立了两处洗衣所（已有一处开工），为工厂、矿山独身工人洗衣服，估计能容纳二百人做工，可解决新安、望花两区大部分烈军属的职业问题。图们市军属生产部组织了制糖、制粉、豆腐、豆芽四个小作坊，都经营得很好，现在已有一百零二名烈军属在作坊内工作。并建立了学习会和生活检讨会，使烈军属的政治觉悟与生产积极性不断提高。在东北，各个小城市的优抚工作也有了改进。如泰安县城区把军属商店的资金九千万元拿来办了麻袋工厂，现有的四十五名军属女工，每人每天能挣三千元；将来可吸收二百多名烈军属参加工作。该厂经营情况很好，原料充足，产品销路很广，外面订货的很多。这个工厂并可将所得利润救济个别生活困难的烈军属。此外，由于政府民政部门与各生产部门联络得较好，给烈军属又找到了很多工作，如给粮食公司挑豆子，给农场栽树等，解决了四十名烈军属及革命残废军人、复员军人的职业问题。
  （三）
    根据东北区过去及现在的城市优抚工作的情况，得到以下几点经验：
    一、组织城市烈军属生产，必须根据不同城市的特点来确定生产计划。大中城市应随着经济建设事业的发展，围绕着工厂企业的生产需要，组织多样的、分散的小型轻工业、手工加工业，吸收烈军属参加生产；矿区应围绕工矿生产组织加工或副业生产；小城市和城区应面向农村，搞小手工业或季节性的临时副业生产。不加分别的“生拉硬套”的作法应当反对。譬如有的城市组织麻袋工厂获利很多，换个地方可能就要赔本。
    二、城市的优抚工作，特别是组织烈军属生产，必须反对那种没有长远打算的做法。现有的烈军属生产组织也应有计划地使之经常化与正规化起来。过去有很多城市为补助烈军属的生活，成立了商店或在国营商店协助下办消费合作社图利，不从根本上解决问题，这是应当迅速改正的。最近四平市已把这样的福利组织改变为建筑公司、制米厂或草袋工厂，收容了六十一名烈军属及革命残废军人、复员军人参加生产，这样做是很对的。
    三、烈军属参加生产、生活改善后，领导上必须认真帮助他们学习政治和文化。哈尔滨烈军属麻袋工厂及最近图们市烈军属生产部的作法就很好，一方面提高了烈军属的政治觉悟，同时又协助政府，带动群众，推动了各项工作。
    组织烈军属生产，是城市优抚工作的主要工作，关键在于发挥群众力量，倚靠群众多想办法，大家出钱出力。因此，拥军优属委员会的组织就特别重要。最近黑龙江省有些县在整顿这一组织时，吸收合作社、税务局、工商会、工厂、企业、医院的人员及驻军、群众代表参加，研究拥军优属工作，这种作法值得提倡。
