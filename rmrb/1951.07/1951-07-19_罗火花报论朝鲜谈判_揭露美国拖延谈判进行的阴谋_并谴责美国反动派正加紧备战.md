Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 16th: The Romanian Workers' Party organ, *Spark* (I'm preserving the tone and so rendering the name literally), commented on the Korean armistice talks on July 14th, saying: The start of the Korean armistice talks foreshadows a relaxation of the international situation, and hundreds of millions of honest people are heartily rejoicing over this situation, but a bunch of American tycoons who are eager to drink human blood and make huge profits are trembling with fear. The *Wall Street Journal* shamelessly admitted: "The threat of a successful peace could greatly reduce projected profits." The paper said on another day: "The feeling that the war will soon end makes us feel uncomfortable." "In order to ensure that the arms expansion program continues to be implemented when the war stops, a propaganda plan must be drawn up to give the mobilization effort a new stimulus." Another newspaper, the *Kansas City Star*, which serves as a mouthpiece for monopoly capitalists, said: "The stock market and the people who lead the stock market should be able to weigh the current situation so that if the worst happens and peace is achieved in Korea, they can feel comforted by the hope that there are still war crises elsewhere."

The political representatives of American monopoly capitalists are frantically and intensely executing Wall Street's sinister orders. Truman said: "Relaxing the work of expanding armaments would be one of the most harmful things that could happen, and therefore this should not be allowed to happen." Dewey, the leader of the "opposition" Republican Party, said: "The Cold War will continue for the rest of our lives." One of the most cunning warmongers, Truman's special diplomatic advisor Harriman, also clamored: "We must be prepared to fight anywhere, by any means." The new high tide of war hysteria was immediately expressed in action. Shortly after Malik made his proposal, Truman asked Congress to approve a new $4.5 billion in military spending for the construction of American military equipment and bases.

*Spark* went on to say: At the behest of monopoly capitalists, the US ruling clique is trying at all costs to create a war crisis in another place, and is blatantly stepping up the re-militarization of their main springboard. In Korea, the US imperialists had to start armistice talks against their will, and now they are doing their best to delay the negotiations. *Spark* concluded: Even so, the US imperialists must now consider more carefully than before a powerful force, which is the will of the people of the world who sincerely hope for peace.

　　罗火花报论朝鲜谈判
　  揭露美国拖延谈判进行的阴谋
　  并谴责美国反动派正加紧备战
    【新华社十六日讯】罗马尼亚通讯社布加勒斯特讯：罗马尼亚工人党机关报《火花报》七月十四日评论朝鲜停战谈判说：朝鲜停战谈判的开始，预示了国际情势的缓和，数亿正直人民因为这种情况而衷心庆幸，可是美国一帮急于要喝人血并大捞利润的富豪们却害怕得发抖了。《华尔街日报》无耻地承认：“和平成功的威胁，可能大大减少预计的利润。”该报在另一天又说：“认为战争不久就要停止的那种感觉，叫我们心中难受。”“为了使战争停止时扩张军备计划仍得施行，就必须拟订出一项宣传计划来，好给动员工作一个新的刺激。”另一家作为独占资本家喉舌的报纸《堪萨斯明星报》说：“股票市场和领导股票市场的人们应该能够权衡目前的形势，好使一旦最可怕的事情果然发生而朝鲜和平实现时，自己能够因怀有在其他地方仍有战争危机存在的希望而感到宽心。”
    美国独占资本家的政治代表们，正在狂热而且紧张地执行华尔街的罪恶命令。杜鲁门说：“松弛扩张军备的工作将是可能发生的最有害的事情之一，因此不应该让这种事情发生。”“反对党”共和党的领袖杜威说：“终我们一生，冷战都要继续存在。”最奸险的战争贩子之一，杜鲁门的外交特别顾问哈里曼也叫嚣：“我们必须准备好用任何方法在任何地点作战。”战争歇斯底里的新高潮，立即以行动表现了出来。就在马立克提出建议以后不久，杜鲁门要求国会通过新的军费四十五亿美元，供建设美国军事设备及基地之用。
    《火花报》接着说：美国统治集团根据独占资本家的要求，正在不惜一切代价地努力在另一个地方制造战争危机，正在明目张胆地加紧把他们主要的跳板重新军国主义化。在朝鲜，美帝国主义者不得不违背本来心愿来开始停战谈判，现在它正在尽力拖延谈判的进行。《火花报》最后说：虽然是这样，美帝国主义者现在必须比以前更慎重地考虑一种强大的力量，那就是全世界人民诚恳希望和平的意志。
