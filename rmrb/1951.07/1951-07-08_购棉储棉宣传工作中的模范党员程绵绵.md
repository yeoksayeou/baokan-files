    The Central People's Government Administration Council's instructions on cotton purchasing and storage work and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's call for cotton selling and storage reached Angucheng Village, Shulu County, Hebei Province, on June 9th. All fifty-four Communist Party members in the village held an emergency mobilization meeting that night. The meeting passed a resolution that Party members should go to the masses to carry out propaganda and mobilization. Cheng Mianmian was assigned to carry out propaganda and mobilization work in Shizhang Street. She is a laboring woman in her thirties and a model Communist Party member. Although she had been ill for more than a month and was physically weak, she was determined to persevere in order to complete the task given by the Party. In three days, she mobilized twenty cotton farmers to sell and store 1,250 jin of cotton to state economic organizations, despite her illness.

    In the course of propaganda and mobilization, Cheng Mianmian discovered that most cotton farmers had a "wait and see" mentality, hoping for prices to rise. Shi Laosheng was a well-known old miser in the village and had a lot of cotton stored. Cheng Mianmian thought: It would be good to mobilize others if I could first get through to Lao Sheng's thinking. After dinner, she met Lao Sheng and talked about how the cotton seedlings were growing better this year than last year, but unfortunately some were infested with aphids. Cheng Mianmian asked, "The government is lending sprayers to prevent aphids. Do you want one?" Lao Sheng thought for a moment and said, "Lending sprayers is a good thing the government is doing for us ordinary people. Why wouldn't we want one?" From this, Cheng Mianmian went on to talk about how the country is currently short of cotton, and factories will have to stop production if there is no cotton. Can we farmers just stand by and watch while the American devils try to block us? Then she explained to Lao Sheng that the state, in order to buy cotton, is also taking into account the interests of cotton farmers, adjusting the listed prices, and providing preferential treatment and insurance for cotton storage, as well as paying an interest of 1.2% per month. Lao Sheng's mind cleared up when he heard these reasons, and he readily agreed to sell all his stored cotton, 170 jin, to the state. He also reviewed his past conservative thinking, saying, "In the past, I always felt that 'what's in my pocket is better than what's in my hand,' and only wanted to wait for a high price. This was all old thinking of only caring about myself and not the country." Cheng Mianmian told Cui Luomao about Lao Sheng's cotton sale. Lao Cui said, "That's right! Our family also has ninety jin of seed cotton. Let's sell it to help the factory start work early, and it will also benefit us." Following that, Cheng Mianmian spread the word about Shi Laosheng's cotton sale everywhere, and in one evening, she mobilized six cotton farmers to sell their stored cotton.

    She saw that the cotton of several cotton farmers with 100-200 jin of stored cotton was controlled by women. She thought that to mobilize such households, she must start with the women. Therefore, she first went to Qin Lao Dong's house on the east side of the street. Lao Dong's wife was spinning thread in the doorway. Cheng Mianmian helped her calculate: Which is more cost-effective, weaving homespun cloth or buying fine cloth? After calculating, it was cheaper to buy fine cloth than to weave homespun cloth. If you don't weave homespun cloth, you can still go to the fields to hoe seedlings. Lao Dong's wife nodded repeatedly and said, "That's right! Let's sell our seventy jin of cotton to the government!" Cheng Mianmian then added, "We often say 'Resist America and love the country.' Selling cotton to the country is resisting America and loving the country!" Shi Xiaochun's wife and Qin Waizi, who were sitting next to her, both said, "Let's sell the dozens of jin of cotton in our hands to the country. The factory can keep running; the price is not bad, so it really benefits both the country and ourselves."

    Cheng Mianmian heard that Shi Junman had just come to her mother's house in this village, and her husband's family was also a cotton-growing household, so she went to find her. She mentioned the state's purchase of cotton and also helped her calculate that weaving homespun cloth was not as cost-effective as buying fine cloth. After listening, Shi Junman said, "I trust your words. Since the country needs cotton, let's sell all the twenty jin of cotton that I got from my husband's family to the country!"

    Cheng Mianmian not only took the lead herself, but also led more than a dozen Communist Party members on Shizhang Street to publicize the principle of patriotic cotton selling and storage to every household, and also introduced specific and vivid facts about cotton selling and storage, which enhanced the farmers' patriotic enthusiasm. The three blackboards on the whole street were updated every three days, and newly compiled street poems about patriotic cotton selling were written on the walls. Party member Zhang Zhidong was a straightforward young man who rarely explained the principles during propaganda and was also rigid in his methods. He simply asked people door-to-door, "Do you have cotton at home?" He did not achieve any results after working for two days. Cheng Mianmian found Lao Zhang and said, "It's not too late to talk about selling cotton after you have gotten through to the cotton farmers' thinking!" She also told Lao Zhang about some mass psychology and flexible propaganda and mobilization methods.

    Cheng Mianmian's propaganda and mobilization methods and achievements quickly spread throughout the nearby villages. Under her impetus, Communist Party members in various villages conducted patriotic cotton selling and storage propaganda and mobilization competitions. Cheng Mianmian became a model for Communist Party members in the Angucheng Village area to carry out patriotic cotton selling and storage mobilization.

　　购棉储棉宣传工作中的模范党员程绵绵
    新华社记者  世恺
    中央人民政府政务院关于购棉、储棉工作的指示和中共中央关于售棉、储棉的号召，六月九日传到了河北省束鹿县安古城村后，全村五十四名共产党员就连夜举行了紧急动员大会。会上通过了党员应分头向群众进行宣传动员的决议。程绵绵被分配到师张街去进行宣传动员工作。她是个三十多岁的劳动妇女，是模范共产党员。为了完成党所给与的这个任务，她虽然已经闹病一个多月，身体很弱，仍决心坚持下去。在三天内，她一个人就带病动员了二十户棉农向国家经济机关售棉、储棉一千二百五十斤。
    程绵绵在进行宣传动员中发现棉农大都存在着“看涨等售”的心理。师老绳是村中有名的老财迷，棉花存的又多。程绵绵想：先打通老绳的思想，就好动员别人了。晚饭后她见到老绳，谈起今年棉苗长得比去年还强，可惜有的生了溺虫（即蚜虫）。程绵绵就问：“为了防溺虫，政府贷给喷雾器，你要不要？”老绳想了一下，说：“贷给喷雾器，是政府帮助咱老百姓的好事，咱还不要吗？”程绵绵又从此谈到现在国家缺棉花，工厂没有棉花就要停工，美国鬼子想封锁住咱们，咱们农民能眼巴巴的看着吗？接着又给老绳讲了国家为了买棉花，也照顾到棉农的利益，调整了牌价，储存棉花有优待，又保险，每月又能得一分二的利息。老绳一听这些道理，心里也亮堂了，一口答应把全部存棉一百七十斤卖给国家，并且检讨自己过去的保守思想说：“过去咱总觉得‘怀里揣着不如手里拿着’，只想等个大价钱，这都是只看自己，不管国家的老思想。”程绵绵把老绳卖棉花的经过告诉了崔洛茂。老崔说：“对！咱家还有九十斤籽花，卖了吧，帮助工厂早天开工，自己也有好处。”跟着，程绵绵又把师老绳卖棉花的事到处宣传，一晚上就动员六家棉农出售了存棉。
    她看到存棉百八十斤的几户棉农，棉花都掌握在妇女手里。她想动员这样的农户一定得从女人那儿下手。因此她先找到街东头秦老东家。老东的老婆正在门洞里纺线。程绵绵就帮着算账：织土布和买细布那个上算？算来算去，织土布不如买细布便宜。要不织土布，还可下地锄苗。老东的老婆连连点头说：“对！咱那七十斤花卖给政府吧！”程绵绵这时更加上一句：“咱们常说抗美爱国。把棉花卖给国家，就是抗美爱国哪！”旁边坐着的师小纯老婆和秦娃子都说：“把咱手里的几十斤花也卖给国家。工厂可以不停工；价钱又不小，真是利国家又利自己。”
    程绵绵听说师俊满刚来本村住娘家，婆家也是种棉户，就去找她，提起国家买棉花的事，也帮她算了算织土布不如买细布合算这笔账。师俊满听了，说：“我信得着你的话，国家需要棉花，就把俺在婆家分来的二十斤花统统卖给国家吧！”
    程绵绵不光自己带头干，还领导了师张街的十几个共产党员，把爱国售棉、储棉的道理宣传得家喻户晓，还介绍具体生动的售棉、储棉的事实，提高了农民的爱国热情。全街三处黑板报三天出一回，墙上也写上了新编的关于爱国售棉的街头诗。党员张之洞是个口直心快的小伙子，宣传时道理讲得很少，方式又生硬。他只是按户逢人就问：“家里有棉花没有？”工作了两天都没有一点成绩。程绵绵就找到老张说：“先打通了棉农的思想，再提卖棉花也不迟呀！”并且讲了些群众心理和灵活宣传动员的办法给老张听。
    程绵绵宣传动员的方法和成绩，很快便传遍了附近各村。在她的推动下，各村的共产党员进行了售棉宣传动员竞赛。程绵绵成了安古城村一带共产党员进行爱国售棉、储棉动员的榜样。
