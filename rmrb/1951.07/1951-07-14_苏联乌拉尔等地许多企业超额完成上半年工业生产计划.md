Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: Many enterprises in the Soviet Union have exceeded their production plans for the first half of the year. According to TASS news: At the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works in the Urals, blast furnace operators had already begun producing metal for the second half of the year in late June. Steelworkers and blast furnace operators at the "Serov" Metallurgical Plant have completed their six-month production plan ahead of schedule. In the past two months, various production teams at this plant have saved 800,000 rubles by conserving fuel and raw materials. The efficiency of the Martin furnaces at the "Stalin" Metallurgical Plant in Ukraine has increased by 11.7 percent compared to pre-war levels, the steel output per square meter of furnace area has increased by 34.3 percent, and the productivity of rolling mills has increased by 18.4 percent. Workers at the Baku No. 4 oil field completed their six-month production plan before June 25th.

Workers in the machinery manufacturing, steel, power, chemical, and shoemaking industries in Chirchik, Uzbekistan, produced a large quantity of products exceeding the plan by the end of June. For example, the Chirchik Electric Chemical Combine exceeded its plan by producing two train cars of mineral fertilizer in June and saved an additional three million rubles. Food industry enterprises in the Georgian Republic completed their six-month production plan ten days ahead of schedule, increasing the production of food worth more than 20 million rubles. The felt factory in the capital, Yerevan, after completing its production plan ahead of schedule, produced an additional 33,000 meters of felt, one-third of which was made from saved raw materials. Workers at the "Kondopoga" paper mill in the Karelia-Finnish Republic exceeded their six-month plan by producing several hundred tons of paper.

Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch: According to TASS, Tashkent: The Soviet Central Asian republics are building houses on a large scale. In the Kyrgyz Republic, 780,000 square meters of residential space has been built in cities and workers' residential areas since the war, and 46,000 houses have been built in rural areas. In addition, urban residents have obtained state loans to build several thousand private houses. In the republic's capital, Frunze, about 2,500 new buildings have been completed since the war. Many workers, staff, scientists, and teachers have moved into exquisite apartment buildings. The number of houses built in Kyrgyzstan this year will exceed the total number built during all pre-war five-year plans.

The Tajik Republic has built more than 500,000 square meters of residential space since the war. The Republic's capital, Stalinabad, which used to be a remote village, has now become a metropolis with many beautiful houses. During the post-war period, about 850 new houses and many private houses were built there. Leninabad, a major industrial center in Tajikistan, has also built 400 houses since the war. This year, large-scale housing construction projects are underway throughout Tajikistan.

This year, more than 50 apartment buildings with modern equipment have been built in Tashkent, the capital of the Uzbek Republic. Many workers' houses are being built in Chirchik. Residents of Uzbek cities will receive houses with a floor area of about 200,000 square meters this year.
