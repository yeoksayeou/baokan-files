　　Believe in the Great Strength of the Working Class
    Some leading cadres in our enterprises constantly say, "We must rely on the working class to run the people's enterprises well." But in their actual work, they often violate this basic principle.
    In carrying out state transportation tasks, the leading cadres of the Qiqihar Railway Administration only saw objective difficulties but failed to see the great strength of the working masses in overcoming difficulties. The leading cadres of the Northwest Machine Factory believed that they had many years of revolutionary experience and work experience, and even thought that doing many things through the masses was "both troublesome and slow." Although a factory management committee was established, it was like "a deaf man's ear," placed there without any effect. This reflects that some of our enterprise leading cadres still have an unclear understanding of the fundamental issue of relying on the working class to improve production.
    The most fundamental reason why our state-owned enterprises have achieved unprecedented brilliant results in the past two years is that, under the correct leadership and education of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese working class has raised its class consciousness and begun to exert the creativity and initiative of the working class. However, some enterprise leading cadres fail to see this fact. They still do not believe in the strength and wisdom of the working masses. Sometimes, even when the masses present good solutions to them, they still do not rely on the masses to solve difficulties, causing losses in production. Generally, our enterprise leading cadres are very enthusiastic about completing state tasks, which is very good and should be maintained and carried forward. But if personal enthusiasm is not built on the basis of the masses' enthusiasm, that is, if we do not rely on the working class, it is impossible to improve production. The lessons of the Qiqihar Railway Administration and the Northwest Machine Factory should arouse the vigilance of leading cadres in factories and mines across the country.

　　要相信工人阶级的伟大力量
    我们有些企业领导干部，口口声声地说：“我们必须依靠工人阶级，办好人民企业。”但在实际工作中，他们往往违背了这个基本原则。
    齐齐哈尔铁路管理局领导干部在执行国家运输任务中，只看见客观的困难，却看不见工人群众克服困难的伟大力量。西北机器厂的领导干部认为自己有多年的革命经验和工作经验，甚至以为许多事情通过群众是“既麻烦又缓慢”；虽然也成立了工厂管理委员会，却是“聋子的耳朵”，摆在那里不起作用。这反映出我们某些企业领导干部对于依靠工人阶级搞好生产这个根本的问题，还认识不清。
    我们的国家企业之所以能够在这两年内有了史无前例的辉煌成绩，最根本的原因，是中国工人阶级在中国共产党的正确领导和教育之下，提高了阶级觉悟，开始发挥了工人阶级的创造性和积极性。但是有些企业领导干部却看不清这个事实，他们依然不相信工人群众的力量和智慧，有时甚至群众把好办法摆在他们眼前，他们还是不依靠群众来解决困难，使生产遭受了损失。我们的企业领导干部一般的对完成国家任务的积极性都很高，这是很好的，是应当永远保持和发扬光大的。但如果不把个人的积极性建筑在群众的积极性的基础上，即不依靠工人阶级，搞好生产是不可能的。齐齐哈尔铁路管理局和西北机器厂的教训，应当引起全国各厂矿领导干部的警惕。
