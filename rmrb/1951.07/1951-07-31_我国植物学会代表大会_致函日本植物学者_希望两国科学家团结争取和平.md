Xinhua News Agency, 30th -- The First National Congress of the China Botanical Society, currently meeting in Beijing, has written a letter to Japanese botanical workers. The letter states that China has achieved true independence and freedom. Science and scientific workers are receiving due attention from the People's Government and the people. As a result, China's scientific work has seen initial development. Chinese scientific workers, including botanical workers, are contributing their strength to the country's peaceful construction and the happiness of mankind. The letter points out that American imperialism has suffered heavy blows from the Chinese and Korean people in Korea, and its aggressive plans have failed disgracefully; however, it has not learned the lessons it should have from its failure, and is actively pursuing a separate peace treaty with Japan and rearming Japan. This not only threatens the security of all peace-loving countries, but will also destroy the prospects for Japan's peaceful development, leading Japan and the Japanese people to destruction and death. The letter emphasizes that the Chinese people and the Japanese people share the same goal of defending world peace, and the scientific workers of China and Japan should resolutely unite to fight for Japan's democratic peace and to defend world peace!

　　我国植物学会代表大会
　  致函日本植物学者
　  希望两国科学家团结争取和平
    【新华社三十日讯】正在北京举行会议的中国植物学会第一届全国代表大会写信给日本植物学工作者。信中说，中国已获得了真正独立和自由。科学和科学工作者受到人民政府和人民应有的重视，因而，中国的科学工作已有了初步的发展。中国的科学工作者，包括植物学工作者在内，正为国家的和平建设和人类的幸福而贡献出自己的力量。信中指出：美帝国主义在朝鲜遭受中朝人民的沉重打击，它的侵略计划已经可耻的失败了；但是它并没有从失败中获得应有的教训，却积极地进行单独对日媾和，重新武装日本。这不但威胁各爱好和平国家的安全，也将破坏日本和平发展的前途，把日本和日本人民导向毁灭和死亡。信中着重指出：中国人民和日本人民保卫世界和平的目标是一致的，中日两国的科学工作者应该坚决地团结起来，为争取日本的民主和平，保卫世界和平而奋斗！
