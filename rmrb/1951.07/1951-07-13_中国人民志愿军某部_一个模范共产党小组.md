　　A Model Communist Party Group of a Unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army

　　The Communist Party Group of the Fourth Squad of the Third Company of a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has recently been commended by the Communist Party Committee of the unit as a model group. This group consists of eight Communist Party members. They have consistently played a core and leading role in combat and work, ensuring the successful completion of various tasks in peacetime and wartime by the squad. As a result, the squad has successively won the honorary titles of "Combat Model Squad," "Drill Model Squad," and "Resist-America-Aid-Korea Model Squad," and has been awarded a collective Second Class Merit.

　　When the unit entered Korea, the Communist Party members of the group displayed a high degree of class fraternity during continuous long marches, carrying out mutual assistance in thought and physical strength throughout the squad, maintaining high morale, and ensuring that no one fell behind. During the Battle of Changjin Lake, there was a period of great supply difficulties. The Communist Party members of the group preferred to go hungry themselves, giving their limited food to non-Party comrades. In combat, Communist Party members He Baichao, Wang Kechuan, and Gao Wanjia not only charged ahead but also found good terrain for non-Party comrades to use, which moved the non-Party soldiers to propose the slogan "Resolutely follow the Communist Party members." When breaking through the enemy's firepower blockade, the Communist Party members cleverly organized all the squad comrades, bravely penetrated the enemy's ranks, and successively seized three heavy machine guns, eliminating the enemy in front of them. After the battle, the entire squad was awarded the title of "Resist-America-Aid-Korea Model Squad."

　　During the training period, the Communist Party members of the group were not afraid of difficulties and led the masses to successfully complete the training tasks. Six of the eight Party members were awarded merits, and two were selected as training models. The entire squad was awarded the title of "Drill Model Squad."

　　After the Han River defense battle began, the Communist Party members of the squad not only dug strong fortifications for themselves but also helped non-Party comrades dig. Under the leadership and assistance of the Communist Party members of the group, the Fourth Squad's fortifications were the fastest and best dug in the entire company. During the battle, the squad was tasked with defending Height 298.3. This was one of the enemy's key points of attack. The squad held its position for seven hours, repelling five successive attacks by enemy companies and battalions, killing and wounding more than one hundred enemies. In the battle, the Communist Party members demonstrated a high degree of revolutionary heroism. Party member Li Jinshan continued to fight even after being seriously wounded, and constantly put forward inspiring slogans to encourage his comrades to fight tenaciously. When the enemy launched an attack on the Fourth Squad's position with two companies in three directions, non-Party soldier Zhang Chaoyuan, encouraged by Li Jinshan, jumped out of the fortifications and fought the enemy with hand grenades. His right arm was broken, but he refused to leave the front line and continued to throw hand grenades with his left hand. When the enemy launched its fifth counterattack, the four Communist Party members and one non-Party soldier defending the hilltop used their last few anti-tank grenades to counter the enemy. After the anti-tank grenades were exhausted, Communist Party member Wang Kechuan organized his comrades to fight the enemy with stones, finally repelling the enemy's fifth counterattack. After the battle, the entire squad was collectively awarded a Second Class Merit.

　　中国人民志愿军某部
    一个模范共产党小组
    中国人民志愿军某部第三连第四班的中国共产党小组，最近被该部中国共产党党委会嘉奖为模范小组。这一个小组一共有八个共产党员。他们在战斗和工作中一贯起着核心作用和带头作用，保证了该班圆满地完成平时和战时的各项任务。该班因此曾经先后荣获“战斗模范班”“练兵模范班”“抗美援朝模范班”的光荣称号，并且立过集体二等功。
    当该部进入朝鲜的时候，该组共产党员即在连续的长途行军中，发挥高度的阶级友爱精神，在全班中展开了思想上和体力上的互助，使全班保持旺盛的情绪，没有一个人掉队。在长津湖战役中，有一个时期供应很困难。该组共产党员们宁愿自己挨饿，把自己仅有的粮食让给非党战友们吃。在战斗中该组的共产党员何百超、王克传、高万加不但冲锋在前，而且找好地形给非党战友利用，感动得非党战士们提出“坚决跟着共产党员走”的口号。在突过敌人的火力封锁时，共产党员们巧妙地组织全班战友，勇猛插入敌阵，接连夺了三挺重机枪，消灭了当面的敌人。战后全班荣膺“抗美援朝模范班”的称号。
    在练兵时期，该组共产党员不怕困难，带领群众，出色地完成了练兵任务。八个党员有六个人立了功，二个人当选为练兵模范。全班荣获“练兵模范班”的称号。
    汉江地区的阻击战开始后，该班的共产党员们不仅自己挖了坚固的工事，还帮助非党战友们挖。在该小组共产党员的带头和帮助下，第四班的工事是全连队中挖得最快最好的。在战斗过程中，该班担任坚守二九八点三高地的任务。这里是敌人进攻重点之一。该班坚守阵地七小时，击退敌人成连成营的五次轮番进攻，杀伤敌人一百多。在战斗中共产党员们表现了高度的革命英雄主义精神。党员李金山在身负重伤后，仍然坚持战斗，并且不断提出鼓动口号，鼓励战友们顽强战斗。当敌人以两个连的兵力分三路向第四班阵地进攻时，非党战士张朝元在李金山的鼓动下，跳出工事和敌人拚手榴弹。他的右胳膊被打断了，还拒绝下火线，继续用左手打手榴弹。当敌人发动第五次反扑时，据守在山头上的四个共产党员和一个非党战士，用最后几颗反坦克手榴弹迎击敌人。反坦克手榴弹打光以后，共产党员王克传就组织他的战友们用石头和敌人拚，终于把敌人第五次反扑击退。战后全班集体立了二等功。
