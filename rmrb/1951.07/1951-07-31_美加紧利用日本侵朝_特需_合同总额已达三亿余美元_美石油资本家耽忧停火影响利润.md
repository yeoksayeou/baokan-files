Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 30th: According to the Economic and Scientific Bureau of the U.S. occupation forces in Japan, as of July 1, the total value of so-called "special procurement" contracts signed between the United States and Japan to utilize Japanese resources and manpower for the Korean War has reached over $331.86 million. Among them, the value of materials is over $235 million, and the value of labor services is over $96 million.

    At the same time, the United States is illegally using Japanese construction companies to build military bases on Okinawa. On the 23rd, the "Tokyo Office of the Okinawa Works Area" of the U.S. military signed construction contracts with the Japanese "Shimizu" and "Obayashi" construction companies. The contracts stipulate that these two companies will repair ammunition depots, build factories, and construct roads for the U.S. military on Okinawa. The total cost of the project is $4.72 million.

    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 30th: The New York "Daily Worker" reported on July 20 that the U.S. oil industry, whose profits have soared, is worried that a Korean armistice will affect their interests, according to the Hearst-owned Los Angeles "Examiner" and the latest issue of "World Oil" magazine.

    Lloyd, the petroleum news editor of the "Examiner," said: "The U.S. oil industry has bet that the Korean War will continue and that civilian consumption will remain high." Lloyd complained: "Now we may lose one or more of these bets, and oil inventories may soon be large enough to threaten the interests of the oil industry."

    Cordell, publisher of "World Oil" magazine, and Becker, editor, said that military demand for oil is currently about 400,000 barrels per day. A Korean armistice and peace will eliminate this lucrative demand, and California's heavy oil "will become a slow-selling commodity in the market and will not be as popular as it is now."

　　美加紧利用日本侵朝
　  “特需”合同总额已达三亿余美元
　  美石油资本家耽忧停火影响利润
    【新华社三十日讯】东京消息：据美国驻日占领军总部经济科学局透露：截至七月一日为止，美国为利用日本物力、人力进行侵朝战争而和日本签订的所谓“特需”合同，总额已达三亿三千一百八十六万多美元。其中物资方面为二亿三千五百多万美元，劳务方面为九千六百多万美元。
    同时，美国还非法利用日本建设公司修建冲绳岛军事基地。美军“冲绳工务区东京办事处”二十三日和日本“清水”、“大林”两建设公司签订工程合同。合同规定这两家公司为冲绳岛美军修理军火仓库、建设工厂和修筑道路。工程费共计四百七十二万美元。
    【新华社布拉格三十日电】纽约《工人日报》七月二十日报道：赫斯特系的洛杉矶《考察者》报和最近一期的《世界石油》杂志透露：利润激增的美国石油工业界，都耽忧朝鲜停火将影响他们的利益。
    《考察者》报的石油新闻编辑洛埃德称：“美国的石油工业已经下了赌注，认为朝鲜战争将继续打下去，民用消费仍会很大。”洛埃德叫苦说：“现在可能输去一个或更多的赌局了，石油存货不久就可能多到足以威胁石油工业利益的程度了。”
    “世界石油”杂志的发行人寇德莱与编辑贝克尔说：石油的军事需求目前每日约为四十万桶。朝鲜停火与和平、将打消这种有利可图的需求，加利福尼亚的重油“在市场上将变成一种滞销的货物，不会像在目前那样吃香了。”
