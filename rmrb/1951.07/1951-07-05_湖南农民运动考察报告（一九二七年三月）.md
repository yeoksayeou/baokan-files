Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 5, 1951

The following report was written by Comrade Mao Zedong to counter the right-wing pressure within and outside the Party at that time. To address this issue, Comrade Mao Zedong conducted a 32-day investigation in Hunan and wrote this report. At that time, the right-wing opportunists led by Chen Duxiu within the Party did not accept Comrade Mao Zedong's views and insisted on their erroneous opinions. Their main error was being intimidated by the reactionary tide of the Kuomintang, not daring to support the great peasant revolutionary struggle that had already risen and was rising. To appease the Kuomintang, they were willing to abandon the peasants, who were the most important allies, leaving the working class and the Communist Party isolated and helpless. The Kuomintang's betrayal and the launch of the "anti-communist purge" and anti-people's war in the summer of 1927 were mainly due to this weakness of the Communist Party.

The seriousness of the peasant question

This time, I went to Hunan and conducted an on-the-spot investigation of the situation in the five counties of Xiangtan, Xiangxiang, Hengshan, Liling, and Changsha. From January 4 to February 5, a total of 32 days, I held investigation meetings in the countryside and county towns, listening carefully to the reports of experienced peasants and agricultural movement comrades, and obtained a lot of materials. Many truths about the peasant movement are completely opposite to what I heard from the gentry class in Hankou and Changsha. Many strange things are seen and heard for the first time. I think these situations exist in many places. All kinds of arguments against the peasant movement must be quickly corrected. The revolutionary authorities' various wrong handling of the peasant movement must be quickly changed. Only in this way can the revolution benefit. Because the current rise of the peasant movement is a very big issue. In a short period of time, tens of millions of peasants from the central, southern, and northern provinces of China will rise up, with a momentum like a sudden storm, extremely swift and violent. No matter what great force will be able to suppress it. They will break through all the nets that bind them and rush forward on the road to liberation. All imperialists, warlords, corrupt officials, local tyrants, and evil gentry will be buried by them. All revolutionary parties and revolutionary comrades will be examined by them and decide to abandon or support them. Will you stand at the front and lead them? Or stand at the back and criticize them with gestures? Or stand in front of them and oppose them? Every Chinese person has the freedom to choose among these three, but the situation will force you to choose quickly.

Organize

The peasant movement in Hunan, in the counties of Xiangzhong and Xiangnan that have already developed, can roughly be divided into two periods. January to September of last year was the first period, the organizational period. During this period, January to June was the period of secret activities, and July to September was the period of public activities after the revolutionary army drove away Zhao Hengti. During this period, the total number of peasant association members was only about 300,000 to 400,000, and the number of direct leaders was only about 1 million. There was no struggle in the countryside, so there was no criticism from all walks of life. Because peasant association members could act as guides, spies, and porters, the officers of the Northern Expeditionary Army still had a few good words to say. From October to January of this year was the second period, the revolutionary period. The number of peasant association members increased to 2 million, and the number of directly led masses increased to 10 million. Because most peasants joining the peasant association only wrote one person's name per family, 2 million members meant about 10 million people. In the total number of peasants in Hunan, almost half have been organized. In counties such as Xiangtan, Xiangxiang, Liuyang, Changsha, Liling, Ningxiang, Pingjiang, Xiangyin, Hengshan, Hengyang, Leiyang, Chen County, Anxiang, etc., almost all peasants have gathered under the organization of the peasant association and are under the leadership of the peasant association. Since the peasants have such a vast organization, they have begun to take action, thus creating an unprecedented peasant revolution in four months.

Overthrow local tyrants and evil gentry, all power to the peasant association

The main targets of the peasants' attacks are local tyrants and evil gentry, lawless landlords, and various feudal thoughts and systems. This attack momentum is like a sudden storm and a violent wind, those who follow it survive, and those who resist it perish. The result is that the privileges of feudal landlords for thousands of years have been swept away like fallen flowers. The dignity and authority of landlords have been completely swept away. Once the power of landlords is overthrown, the peasant association becomes the only power organ, truly achieving what is called "all power to the peasant association." Even small quarrels between husbands and wives have to be resolved in the peasant association. All matters, if the peasant association does not attend, cannot be resolved. The peasant association in the countryside is simply dictatorial, truly "saying what you can do and doing what you say." Outsiders can only say that the peasant association is good and cannot say that the peasant association is bad. Local tyrants and evil gentry, lawless landlords, have completely lost their right to speak, and no one dares to say a word against them. Under the power of the peasant association, the local tyrants and evil gentry of the first class fled to Shanghai, the second class fled to Hankou, the third class fled to Changsha, the fourth class fled to the county town, and the local tyrants and evil gentry of the fifth class and below surrendered to the peasant association in the countryside.

"I'll pay ten yuan, please let me join the peasant association," said a small evil gentry.

"Hey! Who wants your stinking money!" the peasants replied.

Many middle and small landlords, rich peasants, and even middle peasants who used to oppose the peasant association now want to join the peasant association but cannot. I went to various places and often encountered such people who pleaded with me, "Please let the provincial commissioner vouch for me!"

In the Qing Dynasty, local household registration was divided into two kinds: the main register and the supplementary register. Good people were entered in the main register, and bandits and other bad people were entered in the supplementary register. Now in some places, peasants use this matter to scare those who used to oppose the peasant association: "Put them in the supplementary register!"

Those people were afraid of being entered in the supplementary register and tried every means to join the peasant association, hoping to write their names on the peasant association's register to be at ease. But they often encountered strict rejection from the peasant association, so they always lived in suspense; excluded from the peasant association, they seemed homeless, and in the local dialect, it is called "floating."

In summary, the so-called "peasant association" that was looked down upon by everyone four months ago has now become the most glorious thing. Those who used to kneel down under the power of the gentry now kneel down under the power of the peasants. No matter who it is, they all acknowledge that the world before and after October of last year is completely different.

"Terrible" and "Great"

The peasants' rebellion in the countryside has disturbed the gentry's sweet dreams. News from the countryside spread to the city, and the gentry in the city immediately cried out in alarm. When I first arrived in Changsha, I met people from all walks of life and heard many street talks. From the middle class and above to the right-wing of the Kuomintang, all agreed that "it is terrible." Even those who are very revolutionary, under the pressure of the "terrible" faction's citywide rumors, closed their eyes and thought about the situation in the countryside, and also became discouraged, unable to deny the word "terrible." Even progressive people only said, "This is something that should happen in the process of revolution, although it is terrible." In short, no matter who it is, they cannot completely deny the word "terrible." In fact, as mentioned earlier, it is the vast peasant masses rising up to complete their historical mission, it is the democratic forces in the countryside rising up to overthrow the feudal forces in the countryside. The feudal forces of local tyrants and evil gentry, lawless landlord class, are the foundation of autocratic politics for thousands of years, the cornerstone of imperialism, warlords, corrupt officials. Overthrowing these feudal forces is the true goal of the national revolution. Sun Yat-sen dedicated his life to the national revolution for forty years, doing what he wanted to do but did not achieve. The peasants achieved it in a few months. This is a great merit that has not been achieved in forty years or even thousands of years. This is great. There is nothing "terrible," it is not "terrible at all." "Terrible" is clearly a theory that strikes at the peasants from the standpoint of landlord interests, clearly a theory that the landlord class tries to preserve the old feudal order and obstruct the construction of a new democratic order, clearly a counter-revolutionary theory. Every revolutionary comrade should not follow blindly. If you are a person who has determined your revolutionary standpoint and has run to the countryside to take a look, you must feel a kind of unprecedented exhilaration, tens of millions of slaves—peasants—are there overturning their man-eating enemies. The actions of the peasants are completely correct, their actions are great! "Great" is the theory of peasants and other revolutionary factions. All revolutionary comrades must know: the national revolution needs a great change in the countryside. The Xinhai Revolution did not have this change, so it failed. Now there is this change, which is an important factor in the completion of the revolution. All revolutionary comrades must support this change, otherwise they will stand on the counter-revolutionary position.

The so-called "excessive" problem

There are also some people who say, "The peasant association should be established, but the current actions of the peasant association are a bit too excessive." This is the opinion of the middle faction. What is the actual situation? It is true that peasants in the countryside are somewhat "out of control." The power of the peasant association is supreme, and landlords are not allowed to speak, their dignity is swept away. This is equivalent to knocking down the landlords and stepping on them with a foot. "Put you in the supplementary register!" Fining and donating to local tyrants and evil gentry, breaking sedan chairs. In the homes of those who oppose the peasant association, a group of people rush in, kill pigs and take grain. The beds of the daughters and wives of local tyrants and evil gentry can also be stepped on and rolled on. They often arrest people and make them wear high hats to parade around the countryside, "Evil gentry! Today you recognize us!" Doing whatever they want, everything is abnormal, and a terrifying phenomenon is created in the countryside. This is what some people call "excessive," "over-correcting," "unacceptable." This argument seems reasonable but is actually wrong. First, the above-mentioned things are all forced out by the local tyrants and evil gentry, lawless landlords themselves. Local tyrants and evil gentry, lawless landlords, have always relied on their power to bully the peasants, so the peasants have such great resistance. Wherever the resistance is the strongest and the trouble is the biggest, it is where the local tyrants and evil gentry, lawless landlords, are the most evil. The peasants' eyes are completely correct. Who is evil, who is not evil, who is the most evil, who is slightly less evil, who should be severely punished, who should be lightly punished, the peasants have a very clear calculation, and there are very few cases of punishment not fitting the crime. Second, revolution is not inviting people to eat, not writing articles, not painting or embroidering, it cannot be so elegant, so leisurely, so polite and humble, so gentle and frugal. Revolution is an uprising, a violent action of one class overthrowing another class. The peasant revolution is the revolution of the peasant class overthrowing the power of the feudal landlord class. If the peasants do not use great force, they will never be able to overthrow the deeply rooted landlord power for thousands of years. There must be a great revolutionary upsurge in the countryside to inspire tens of thousands of masses to form a great force. The so-called "excessive" actions mentioned above are all the power created by the great revolutionary upsurge in the countryside. These actions are very necessary in the second period (revolutionary period) of the peasant movement. In the second period, it is necessary to establish the absolute power of the peasants. It is necessary not to allow malicious criticism of the peasant association. It is necessary to overthrow all gentry power and trample the gentry on the ground, even stepping on them with a foot. All the so-called "excessive" actions in the second period have revolutionary significance. In short, every village must create a short-term terrifying phenomenon, otherwise it will not be able to suppress the activities of the counter-revolutionaries in the countryside, it will not be able to overthrow the gentry power. Over-correcting is necessary to correct the bias, but not over-correcting cannot correct the bias. This argument, although it seems different from the previous one on the surface, actually stands on the same standpoint as the previous one, still supporting the interests of the privileged class, the landlord theory. This theory obstructs the rise of the peasant movement, and the result is to destroy the revolution. We must resolutely oppose it.

The so-called "ruffian movement"

The right-wing of the Kuomintang says, "The peasant movement is a ruffian movement, a lazy peasant movement." This argument is quite popular in Changsha. I went to the countryside and saw the gentry saying, "The peasant association can be established, but the current workers are not good, they need to be replaced." This argument is the same as the right-wing's, all saying that the peasant movement can be done (because the peasant movement has risen, no one dares to say it cannot be done), but the current workers are not good, especially hating the lower-level peasant association workers, saying they are all "ruffians." In short, all those who were looked down upon by the gentry in the past, all those who were thrown into the mud by the gentry and had no standing in society and no right to speak, have now raised their heads. Not only have they raised their heads, but they have also taken power. They are kings in the village peasant association (the lowest level of the peasant association) and the village peasant association has become a very fierce thing in their hands. They raise their rough, black hands and put them on the heads of the gentry. They tie up the evil gentry with ropes, put high hats on them, and lead them around the countryside (in Xiangtan and Xiangxiang, it is called parading the team, in Liling, it is called parading the fields). Their harsh and unfeeling scolding sounds are sent into the ears of the gentry every day. They issue orders and command everything. They stand above everyone—once they stood below everyone, so it is called abnormal.

Revolutionary vanguard

For a thing or a person, there are two opposite views, and two opposite arguments come out. "Terrible" and "great," "ruffians" and "revolutionary vanguard," are all examples.

As mentioned earlier, the peasants have accomplished the revolutionary cause that has not been accomplished for many years, and the peasants have done the important work of the national revolution. But is this great revolutionary cause, this important revolutionary work, done by all peasants? No. Among the peasants, there are rich peasants, middle peasants, and poor peasants. Their three conditions are different, and their feelings about the revolution are also different. In the first period, the rich peasants heard that Jiangxi had suffered a great defeat, Chiang Kai-shek had injured his foot and returned to Guangdong by plane. Wu Peifu had recaptured Yuezhou. The peasant association would definitely not last long, and the Three Principles of the People would not rise, because these were things that had never been seen before. The workers of the village peasant association (mostly of the so-called "ruffian" type) took the peasant association's register and entered the door of the rich peasant, saying to the rich peasant, "Please join the peasant association." How did the rich peasant respond? "Peasant association? I have lived here for decades, farmed for decades, and have never seen a peasant association, and I can still eat. I advise you not to do it!" The rich peasants with better attitudes said, "What peasant association, beheading association, don't harm people!" The rich peasants with bad attitudes said. It is very strange that the peasant association has been established for several months and dares to oppose the gentry. The neighboring gentry, because they did not hand over the opium gun, were caught by the peasant association and paraded around the countryside. The county town even killed a big gentry, such as Yan Rongqiu in Xiangtan and Yang Zhize in Ningxiang. The October Revolution Memorial Meeting, the Anti-Imperialist Meeting, the Northern Expedition Victory Celebration, every village had tens of thousands of peasants holding big and small flags, mixed with hoes and shovels, marching in a grand procession to demonstrate. At this time, the rich peasants began to be confused. In the Northern Expedition Victory Celebration, they heard that Jiujiang had been opened, Chiang Kai-shek had not injured his foot, and Wu Peifu had indeed been defeated. Moreover, "Long live the Three Principles of the People," "Long live the peasant association," "Long live the peasants," etc., were clearly written on the "red and green notices" (slogans). "Long live the peasants, are these people also long live?" The rich peasants expressed great confusion. The peasant association thus became very confident. The peasant association said to the rich peasants, "Put you in the supplementary register!" or said, "In another month, the membership fee for each person joining is ten yuan!" Under such a situation, the rich peasants slowly joined the peasant association, some paid five jiao or one yuan (originally only one hundred cash) as the membership fee, and some asked for help to get the peasant association's permission. There are also many stubborn people who have not yet joined the peasant association. The rich peasants joined the peasant association, mostly letting an old man of sixty or seventy years old in their family register a name in the peasant association, because they always feared "conscription." After joining, they did not actively work for the peasant association, their attitude was always passive.

The middle peasants? Their attitude is wavering, they think that the revolution does not bring them much benefit. They have rice in their pots and no one comes to knock on their doors at midnight to collect debts. They also base their reasoning on whether there has ever been a peasant association or not, frowning alone and thinking, "Can the peasant association really stand?" "Can the Three Principles of the People really rise?" Their conclusion is, "I'm afraid not!" They think it all depends on fate, "Doing the peasant association, do you know if fate is willing?" In the first period, the peasant association workers took the register and entered the door of the middle peasants, saying to the middle peasants, "Please join the peasant association!" The middle peasants replied, "Don't be so hasty!" It was not until the second period, when the power of the peasant association was greatly increased, that the middle peasants joined the peasant association. They are better in the peasant association than the rich peasants, but they are not very active for the time being, they still want to see. The peasant association's efforts to attract middle peasants to join and do more explanatory work for them are completely necessary.

The main force that has been fighting hard in the countryside for a long time is the poor peasants. From the secret period to the public period, the poor peasants have been actively fighting. They listen to the leadership of the Communist Party the most. They are mortal enemies with local tyrants and evil gentry, and they attack the camp of local tyrants and evil gentry without hesitation. They say to the rich peasants, "We have already joined the peasant association, why are you still hesitating?" The rich peasants said with a sneering tone, "You have no roof over your head and no place to stick a needle, what is there to hesitate about joining the peasant association!" Indeed, the poor peasants do not fear losing anything. Among them, there are many people who are truly "without a roof over their head and no place to stick a needle," what is there to hesitate about joining the peasant association? According to the investigation in Changsha: in the rural population, poor peasants account for 70%, middle peasants account for 20%, and landlords and rich peasants account for 10%. Among the 70% of poor peasants, there are two categories: extremely poor and relatively poor. Those who are completely unemployed, that is, have neither land nor capital, have completely lost their means of livelihood, and have to go out to join the army, work outside, or become beggars, are all "extremely poor" and account for 20%. Those who are half unemployed, that is, have a little land or a little capital, but eat more and earn less, and live in hard work and worry all year round, such as manual workers, tenants (excluding rich tenants), and semi-self-cultivating farmers, are all "relatively poor" and account for 50%. This large group of poor peasants, totaling 70% of the rural population, is the backbone of the peasant association, the vanguard of overthrowing feudal forces, and the heroes who have accomplished the great revolutionary cause that has not been accomplished for many years. Without the poor peasant class (in the words of the gentry, without "ruffians"), it would not be possible to create the current revolutionary situation in the countryside, it would not be possible to overthrow the local tyrants and evil gentry, and complete the democratic revolution. The poor peasants, because they are the most revolutionary, have taken the leadership of the peasant association. All the chairmen and committee members of the lowest-level peasant associations in the first and second periods are almost all of them (in Hengshan County, the poor peasant class accounts for 50% of the village association staff, the relatively poor peasant class accounts for 40%, and the poor intellectuals account for 10%). This poor peasant leadership is very necessary. Without the poor peasants, there would be no revolution. If they are denied, it is a denial of the revolution. If they are attacked, it is an attack on the revolution. Their revolutionary direction has always been correct. They have damaged the dignity of the local tyrants and evil gentry. They have knocked down the big and small local tyrants and evil gentry on the ground and stepped on them with a foot. Their many so-called "excessive" actions during the revolutionary period are indeed the needs of the revolution. Some counties in Hunan have already made some mistakes in the county government, county party branch, and county peasant association, and have even sent troops to arrest lower-level peasant association workers at the request of landlords. The prisons in Hengshan and Xiangxiang counties have imprisoned many chairmen and committee members of village peasant associations. This mistake is very serious and has encouraged the reactionaries. Just look at the arrest of peasant association committee chairmen and committee members, the local lawless landlords are very happy, and the reactionary atmosphere is very high, you know whether this is a mistake. We must oppose the so-called "ruffian movement," "lazy peasant movement" counter-revolutionary arguments, and especially pay attention not to make mistakes that help the local tyrants and evil gentry attack the poor peasant class. In fact, among the poor peasant leaders, although some of them had flaws in the past, most of them have improved now. They are working hard to ban gambling and clean up bandits. The peasant association is powerful, and gambling and banditry are banned in the area. Some places are really safe and secure. According to the investigation in Hengshan, 85 out of 100 poor peasant leaders have become very good, very capable, and very hardworking. Only 15% still have some bad habits. This can only be called "a few bad elements," and it cannot be followed by the local tyrants and evil gentry's words to generally curse "ruffians." To solve the problem of "a few bad elements," it can only be done under the banner of the peasant association's discipline, to do propaganda to the masses, to train them personally, to discipline the peasant association well, and it is not possible to arbitrarily send troops to arrest people, to lose the trust of the poor peasant class, and to encourage the local tyrants and evil gentry. This point is very important to note.

Fourteen major events

Those who criticize the peasant association say that the peasant association has done many bad things. I have already pointed out in the previous section that the peasants' action of attacking local tyrants and evil gentry is a revolutionary action and there is nothing to criticize. However, the peasants have done many things, and to answer people's criticisms, we must carefully examine all the actions of the peasants and see what they have done. I have classified and summarized the actions of the peasants over the past few months, and the peasants have done a total of fourteen major things under the leadership of the peasant association, as recorded below.

First, organizing the peasants in the peasant association

This is the first major thing done by the peasants. In counties like Xiangtan, Xiangxiang, and Hengshan, almost all the peasants have been organized, and there is almost no peasant who has not risen from the "dark corner." This is the first class. In some counties, a large part of the peasants have been organized, but a small part has not been organized, such as Yiyang and Huacheng counties, this is the second class. In some counties, a small part of the peasants have been organized, but a large part has not been organized, such as Chengbu and Lingling counties, this is the third class. In the western part of Hunan, under the influence of Yuan Zuming, the peasant association propaganda has not reached, and the peasants in many counties have not been organized at all, this is the fourth class. Generally, the counties in the central part of Hunan with Changsha as the center are the most developed, followed by the counties in the southern part of Hunan, and the western part of Hunan is just beginning to organize. According to the statistics of the provincial peasant association in November of last year, there were 37 counties with organizations out of 75 counties in the province, with a total of 1,367,727 members. Among this number, about 1 million were organized during the period when the peasant association was powerful in October and November of last year, and there were only 300,000 to 400,000 before September. Now, after another two months of December and January, the peasant movement is developing rapidly. By the end of January, the number of members has at least reached 2 million. Since each family joining only registers one person, with an average of five people per family, the number of people is about 10 million. This astonishingly rapid development is the reason why all the local tyrants and evil gentry, corrupt officials, and bandits are isolated, why society is amazed at the two different worlds, and why the countryside creates a great revolution. This is the first major thing done by the peasants under the leadership of the peasant association.

Second, politically striking at the landlords

After the peasants have organized, their first action is to strike at the power of the landlord class, especially the local tyrants and evil gentry, from a political point of view, that is, to strike at the power of the landlords from the social position in the countryside, and to raise the power of the peasants. This is a very serious and important struggle. This struggle is the central struggle of the second period, the revolutionary period. This struggle must be victorious, otherwise all economic struggles, such as reducing rent, reducing interest, capital, land, etc., will have no possibility of victory. In many places in Hunan, such as Xiangxiang, Hengshan, and Xiangtan counties, the power of the landlords has been completely overthrown, forming the sole power of the peasants, and there is no problem. However, in counties like Liling, there are still some places (such as the southwest two districts of Liling) where the power of the landlords is lower than the power of the peasants on the surface, but in fact, because the political struggle is not fierce, the power of the landlords still secretly opposes the power of the peasants. These places cannot be said to have won political victory for the peasants, and they must continue to fight politically until the power of the landlords is completely overthrown by the peasants. In summary, the methods by which the peasants politically strike at the landlords are as follows:

Audit. Local tyrants and evil gentry handle local public funds, and most of them embezzle from them, and the accounts are not clear. This time, the peasants took the audit as a topic, and many local tyrants and evil gentry were overturned. In many places, audit committees were organized to specially audit the accounts of local tyrants and evil gentry, and the local tyrants and evil gentry trembled when they saw such organs. Such audit movements were very common in the counties where the peasant movement rose, and the significance was not to recover the money, but to announce the crimes of the local tyrants and evil gentry, to overthrow the political position and social position of the local tyrants and evil gentry.

Fines. As a result of the audit, embezzlement was discovered, or there were past records of bullying peasants, or current actions of destroying the peasant association, or violating the ban on gambling, or not handing over opium guns. Under these charges, the peasants decided that a certain local tyrant should be fined so much, and a certain evil gentry should be fined so much, ranging from tens of yuan to thousands of yuan. Those who have been fined by the peasants naturally have their dignity swept away.

Donations. Donating to the rich but unkind landlords to save the poor, to establish cooperatives, to establish peasant loan offices, or for other uses. Donations are also a kind of punishment, but lighter than fines. Landlords who voluntarily donate to the peasant association to avoid disasters are also quite a few.

Small interrogation. When there are actions and speeches that destroy the peasant association but the charges are relatively light, many people are invited to rush into their homes, and relatively less serious interrogations are made. The result is often to write a "rest letter," stating that they will stop actions and speeches that destroy the reputation of the peasant association.

Large demonstration. Commanding the masses to demonstrate against the local tyrants and evil gentry who have enmity with the peasant association, and eating in their homes, it is inevitable to kill pigs and take grain, and there are many such things. Recently, in Mahe River, Xiangtan, there was an incident where 15,000 people were led to question six evil gentry, lasting four days, and killing more than 130 pigs. The result of the demonstration is often to impose fines.

Wearing high hats and parading around the countryside. This is done in many places. A high paper hat is put on the local tyrants and evil gentry, and the words "local tyrant so-and-so" or "evil gentry so-and-so" are written on the hat, and they are led by a rope, surrounded by a large crowd in front and behind. There are also those who beat gongs and drums, and raise flags to attract attention. This punishment is the most terrifying to the local tyrants and evil gentry. Those who have worn high hats once have their faces completely lost, and they cannot stand up as humans. Therefore, those with money are willing to pay fines and are not willing to wear high hats. But the peasants do not agree, and they still have to wear them. A peasant association was very clever, catching an evil gentry and saying today they would give him a high hat. The evil gentry was frightened black-faced. However, the peasant association decided that today they would not give him a high hat. Because if they gave him a high hat today, this evil gentry would be determined not to fear the crime, it is better to let him go back and wait for another day to wear. The evil gentry did not know when he would wear the high hat, and he was uneasy every day, unable to sit or sleep.

Imprisonment in the county prison. This is a heavier crime than wearing a high hat. The local tyrants and evil gentry are caught and sent to the magistrate's prison, locked up, and the magistrate is asked to punish them. Now the prison is different from before. Before, it was the gentry who sent peasants to be locked up, and now it is the peasants who send the gentry to be locked up.

Expulsion. This is for the local tyrants and evil gentry whose crimes are obvious. The peasants do not want to expel them, but to catch them or kill them. They fear being caught or killed and flee abroad. Important local tyrants and evil gentry in the counties where the peasant movement has developed have almost all fled, and the result is equivalent to being expelled. Among them, the first-class fled to Shanghai, the second-class fled to Hankou, the third-class fled to Changsha, and the fourth-class fled to the county town. These fleeing local tyrants and evil gentry, the safest are those who fled to Shanghai. Those who fled to Hankou, such as the three evil gentry of Huacheng, were eventually caught and brought back. Those who fled to Changsha were more likely to be captured by students from various counties studying in the province at any time, and I personally saw the capture of two in Changsha. Those who fled to the county town have the lowest status, and the peasants' ears and eyes are many, and it is easier to discover them. The financial difficulties of the Hunan government, the financial authorities blamed the peasants for expelling the rich, making it difficult to raise funds, which also shows that the local tyrants and evil gentry are not tolerated in the countryside.

Execution. This must be a very big local tyrant and evil gentry, and it is done by the peasants and people from all walks of life together. For example, Yang Zhize in Ningxiang, Zhou Jiajun in Yueyang, Fu Daonan and Sun Bozhu in Huacheng, were executed by the peasants and people from all walks of life urging the government. Yan Rongqiu in Xiangtan was taken out of the prison by the peasants and people from all walks of life and executed by the peasants themselves. Liu Zhao in Ningxiang was directly killed by the peasants. Peng Zhifan in Liling, Zhou Tianjue and Cao Yun in Yiyang, are waiting to be sentenced and executed by the "Special Court for the Trial of Local Tyrants and Evil Gentry." Such big evil gentry and big local tyrants, executing one will shock the whole county, and it is very effective in eliminating the remnants of feudalism. Such big local tyrants and evil gentry, each county has several dozen, and the least has a few. Each county must execute a few who are extremely evil to be an effective method of suppressing the reactionaries. When the local tyrants and evil gentry were powerful, they killed peasants without blinking an eye. He Maichuan, the head of the local defense bureau in Xinkang Town, Changsha, had been in charge of the local defense for ten years, and nearly a thousand poor peasants were killed in his hands, and he called it "killing bandits." In my hometown, Xiangtan County, the heads of the local defense bureau in Yintian Town, Tang Junyan and Luo Shulin, killed more than fifty people and buried four alive in the fourteen years since the Republic. Among the fifty-odd people who were killed, the first two were completely innocent beggars. Tang Junyan said, "Kill two beggars to open the way!" These two beggars were thus killed. The cruelty of the local tyrants and evil gentry in the past, the white terror in the countryside created by the local tyrants and evil gentry was like this, and now the peasants rise up to execute a few local tyrants and evil gentry, creating a small terrifying phenomenon of suppressing the counter-revolutionaries, what reason is there to say it should not be done?

Third, economically striking at the landlords

Not allowing grain to be taken out of the county, not allowing grain prices to be raised, not allowing hoarding and speculation. This is a major event in the economic struggle of the peasants in Hunan in recent months. From last October to now, the poor peasants have blocked the grain of the landlords and rich peasants from being taken out of the county and have prohibited the raising of grain prices and hoarding and speculation. The result is that the poor peasants' goal has been completely achieved, the grain is blocked like water, the grain price has dropped greatly, and hoarding and speculation have disappeared.

Not allowing rent and deposit to be increased, advocating rent and deposit reduction. In July and August of last year, when the peasant association was still in a period of weak power, the landlords still followed the old practice of heavy exploitation and notified the tenants to increase rent and deposit. However, in October, the power of the peasant association increased greatly, and it unanimously opposed the increase of rent and deposit, so the landlords did not dare to mention the four words of increasing rent and deposit again. By November, the power of the peasants overwhelmed the power of the landlords, and the peasants went a step further to advocate the reduction of rent and deposit. The peasants said, "It's a pity that last autumn, when the rent was paid, the peasant association had no power, otherwise the rent would have been reduced last autumn." For this autumn's rent reduction, the peasants are doing a lot of propaganda, and the landlords are also asking about the rent reduction method. As for the reduction of deposit, it is already being carried out in counties like Hengshan.

Not allowing the withdrawal of tenants. In July and August of last year, there were still many cases of landlords withdrawing tenants and renting to others. After October, no one dared to withdraw tenants. Now, withdrawing tenants and renting to others is completely unthinkable, and only withdrawing tenants to self-cultivate is a bit of a problem. In some places, landlords withdraw tenants to self-cultivate, and peasants do not allow it. In some places, if landlords withdraw tenants because of self-cultivation, it can be allowed, but at the same time, the problem of tenant unemployment arises. This problem has not yet been solved unanimously.

Reducing interest. Anxiang has generally reduced interest, and other counties also have cases of reducing interest. However, in places where the peasant association is powerful, landlords fear "communism" and completely "refuse to lend," and there are almost no lending cases in the countryside. At this time, the so-called reduction of interest is limited to old debts. Old debts not only reduce interest but also do not allow the creditor to demand repayment. The poor peasants say, "No wonder, the year is big, let's repay next year!"

Fourth, overthrowing the feudal rule of local tyrants and evil gentry—overthrowing the district and village

The old-style district and village (that is, the district and village) political power organs, especially the district level, which is close to the county level, are almost completely occupied by local tyrants and evil gentry. The "district" governs a population of one to five or six million, has independent armed forces such as the local defense bureau, has independent financial collection rights such as the land tax, and has independent judicial power such as arbitrarily arresting, imprisoning, interrogating, and punishing peasants. The evil gentry in such organs are simply the kings of the countryside. The peasants pay little attention to the government such as the president, governor, county magistrate, etc., but this group of countryside kings is truly their "superiors," and when they hum once, the peasants know that this is something to pay special attention to. This time, the result of the countryside uprising is that the dignity of the landlord class has been universally overthrown, and the countryside political organs controlled by the local tyrants and evil gentry have naturally collapsed. The district and village heads hide and dare not come out, and all local affairs are pushed to the peasant association to handle. Their response is:

"Do not interfere in other people's business!"

The peasants discuss among themselves, and when they talk about the district and village heads, they say angrily:

"Those things, they are useless!"

"The useless" three words indeed describe the old-style countryside political organs that have experienced the revolutionary storm.

Fifth, overthrowing the landlord's armed forces and establishing the peasant's armed forces

The old-style district and village (that is, the district and village) political power organs, especially the district level, which is close to the county level, are almost completely occupied by local tyrants and evil gentry. The "district" governs a population of one to five or six million, has independent armed forces such as the local defense bureau, has independent financial collection rights such as the land tax, and has independent judicial power such as arbitrarily arresting, imprisoning, interrogating, and punishing peasants. The evil gentry in such organs are simply the kings of the countryside. The peasants pay little attention to the government such as the president, governor, county magistrate, etc., but this group of countryside kings is truly their "superiors," and when they hum once, the peasants know that this is something to pay special attention to. This time, the result of the countryside uprising is that the dignity of the landlord class has been universally overthrown, and the countryside political organs controlled by the local tyrants and evil gentry have naturally collapsed. The district and village heads hide and dare not come out, and all local affairs are pushed to the peasant association to handle. Their response is:

"Do not interfere in other people's business!"

The peasants discuss among themselves, and when they talk about the district and village heads, they say angrily:

"Those things, they are useless!"

"The useless" three words indeed describe the old-style countryside political organs that have experienced the revolutionary storm.

Title: The Revolutionary Significance of the Hunan Peasant Movement
Author:
Date: 1927-02-01
Page: 1

The landlord class in Hunan has relatively few armed forces in the central region but more in the southwest. On average, each county has about six hundred rifles, and with seventy-five counties, there are a total of forty-five thousand rifles. In reality, there might be even more. In the areas where the peasant movement is developing, particularly in the central and southern regions, the peasant uprising is very fierce. The landlord class cannot withstand it, and most of their armed forces have surrendered to the peasant associations and stand on the side of the peasants' interests. For example, in counties like Ningxiang, Pingjiang, Xiangtan, Changsha, Liling, Hengshan, Hengyang, etc., a small part stands in a neutral position but leans towards surrendering, such as in Baojing County. An even smaller part stands in opposition to the peasant associations, such as in Yizhang, Linwu, and Jiahe counties. However, the peasants are currently attacking them and may soon eliminate their forces. The weapons taken from these reactionary landlords will all be converted into "household defense teams" and managed under the new rural self-governing bodies—the peasant associations' rural self-governing bodies. This is one aspect of building the peasant armed forces. Another aspect of building the peasant armed forces is the spear teams of the peasant associations. The spear—a single-edged, double-bladed knife with a long handle—has ten million of them in Xiangtan alone. In other counties like Xiangtan, Hengshan, Liling, Changsha, etc., there are seven to eight million, five to six million, three to four million, and so on. In every county with a peasant movement, spear teams are rapidly developing. These peasants with spears will become the "household defense reserve teams." This vast spear force is greater than the aforementioned old armed forces and is a new rising armed force that makes all local tyrants and evil gentry tremble. The revolutionary government of Hunan should ensure that this armed force is genuinely spread among the twenty million peasants in seventy-five counties. Every young and strong peasant should have a spear, and it should not be restricted, thinking that it is something to be feared. If one is frightened by these spear teams, that person is truly a coward! Only the local tyrants and evil gentry should be afraid, and the revolutionary party should not be afraid.

The sixth point: Overthrowing the power of county magistrates and their subordinates

County politics must be cleaned up by the peasants rising up. Guangdong's Haifeng has already proven this. This time in Hunan, it has been even more thoroughly proven. In counties where local tyrants and evil gentry hold power, no matter who becomes the magistrate, they are almost always corrupt officials. In counties where the peasants have risen up, no matter who becomes the magistrate, they are honest governments. In the few counties I have visited, the magistrates have to consult the peasant associations on every matter. In counties where peasant power is very strong, the peasant associations' words are "magical." If the peasant associations decide to arrest local tyrants and evil gentry in the morning, the magistrate dares not wait until noon; if they decide to arrest them at noon, they dare not wait until the afternoon. When the peasants' power first rises in the countryside, the county magistrates and local tyrants and evil gentry collude to suppress the peasants. When the peasants' power rises to the level of the landlords' power, the county magistrates take a conciliatory attitude towards both the landlords and the peasants. The peasant associations' words are sometimes accepted and sometimes rejected. The aforementioned "magical" words of the peasant associations are spoken when the landlords' power is completely overthrown by the peasants' power. Now, in counties like Xiangtan, Xiangtan, Liling, Hengshan, etc., the political situation is:

(1) All matters are decided by the county magistrate and the joint conference of revolutionary mass organizations. This conference is convened by the county magistrate and held at the county office. In some counties, it is called the "Public Law Alliance Joint Conference," and in others, it is called the "County Affairs Conference." The attendees, besides the county magistrate, include representatives from the county peasant association, county general labor union, county merchant association, county women's union, county teachers' union, county students' union, and the county branch of the Kuomintang. In such conferences, the opinions of various mass organizations influence the county magistrate, and the county magistrate always obeys. Therefore, in Hunan, adopting a democratic committee system for county politics is undoubtedly feasible. The current county government, in form and substance, is already quite democratic. This situation has been achieved in the past two to three months, that is, after the peasants from the countryside have overthrown the power of local tyrants and evil gentry. The magistrates see that their old supporters have fallen, and to hold office, they must find new supporters. This is when they begin to curry favor with the mass organizations, leading to the aforementioned situation.

(2) The judicial officials have no cases. Hunan's judicial system is still such that the magistrate oversees judicial matters, and the judicial officials assist the magistrate in handling cases. The magistrates and their subordinates make money by handling grain taxes, conscription, and extortion in civil and criminal lawsuits. The latter is a reliable source of income. In the past few months, the local tyrants and evil gentry have fallen, and there are no more litigants. The peasants' big and small matters are all handled within various levels of the peasant associations. Therefore, the judicial officials in the county office have almost nothing to do. The judicial official in Xiangtan told me: "Before the peasant association, the county office received an average of sixty civil and criminal lawsuit petitions per day; after the peasant association, the average is only four or five per day." Thus, the magistrates and their subordinates' pockets are left empty.

(3) The security forces, police, and runners have all disappeared. They dare not go to the countryside to extort. In the past, the countryside feared the city, but now the city fears the countryside, especially the county government's police, security forces, and runners, these evil dogs. They are afraid to go to the countryside, and even if they do, they no longer dare to extort. They see the peasants' spears and tremble.

The seventh point: Overthrowing the clan power of ancestral halls and the god power of city gods, earth gods, and Buddhas, as well as the male power of husbands

Chinese men are generally subject to three systematic powers: (1) the national system from the country, province, county, to the village (political power); (2) the clan system from ancestral halls, branch halls, to the family head (clan power); (3) the underworld system from the King of Hell, City God, to the Earth God and Buddha, and the heavenly system from the Jade Emperor to various gods and demons—collectively referred to as the ghost and god system (god power). As for women, in addition to being subject to the aforementioned three powers, they are also subject to the power of men (husband power). These four powers—political power, clan power, god power, and husband power—represent the entire feudal patriarchal ideology and system, and are four extremely large ropes binding Chinese people, especially peasants. How the peasants in the countryside overthrew the landlords' political power has been mentioned earlier. The landlords' political power is the foundation of all powers. Once the landlords' political power is overthrown, the clan power, god power, and husband power will all be shaken. In places where the peasant associations are strong, the clan heads and those who manage the ancestral hall funds no longer dare to oppress their descendants and no longer dare to embezzle the ancestral hall funds. The bad clan heads and managers have been beaten down as local tyrants and evil gentry. The cruel corporal and capital punishments such as "beating the buttocks," "drowning in the pond," and "burying alive" in the ancestral halls are no longer dared to be used. The old rule that women and the poor cannot enter the ancestral hall to drink wine has also been broken. In the Baigao area of Hengshan, women formed groups and entered the ancestral hall, sat down, and drank wine. The clan elders had no choice but to let them have their way. In another place, because the poor farmers were forbidden to enter the ancestral hall to drink wine, a group of poor farmers rushed in, drank and ate heartily, and the local tyrants and evil gentry in long gowns fled in fear. The shaking of god power is also universal with the development of the peasant movement. In many places, the peasant associations have taken over the gods' temples as their meeting places. All peasant associations in various places advocate taking temple property to establish peasant schools and as funds for the peasant associations, naming it "superstition public funds." In Liling, the ban on superstition and the destruction of Buddhas are prevalent. In the northern villages, various districts of peasants have banned the family gods (Nuo gods) from going on pilgrimages. In the Mupo Wubo Ridge temple, many Buddhas were stacked in a corner because there was not enough room for the Kuomintang district party branch. The peasants had no objections. Since then, when someone dies, respects the gods, holds rituals, and sends lanterns for the king, it has become very rare. This is because the peasant association chairman Sun Xiaoshan initiated it, and the local Daoists hated Sun Xiaoshan. In the northern third district, the peasants and schoolteachers of Longfeng Temple chopped up wooden Buddhas and cooked meat to eat. In the southern district, the students and peasants together burned thirty or so Buddhas, leaving only two small Buddhas named "Bao Gong Old Master," which were snatched away by an old peasant who said, "Don't commit sins!" In places where the peasants' power is dominant, only old peasants and women believe in gods, and young and strong peasants do not believe anymore. The peasant associations are run by young and strong peasants, so the overthrow of god power and the elimination of superstition are being carried out everywhere. As for husband power, this thing has always been relatively weak among poor peasants because economically, poor peasant women have to participate more in labor than women of richer classes, so they have more opportunities to speak and decide on household matters. In recent years, the rural economy has become even more bankrupt, and the basic conditions for men to control women have been destroyed. Recently, with the rise of the peasant movement, many places have organized rural women's unions, and women have the opportunity to raise their heads. Husband power is gradually being shaken. In short, all feudal patriarchal ideologies and systems are being shaken with the rise of peasant power. However, at this time, the peasants' energy is concentrated on overthrowing the landlords' political power. If the landlords' political power is completely overthrown, the peasants will begin to attack the family, gods, and male-female relationships; but this attack is still in its "beginning." To completely overthrow these three, it will have to wait until the peasants' economic struggle is fully victorious. Therefore, at present, we should lead the peasants to carry out political struggles to thoroughly overthrow the landlords' power. And immediately begin economic struggles to fundamentally solve the poor peasants' land and other economic problems. As for the destruction of familyism, superstition, and incorrect male-female relationships, these are the natural results of the victory of political and economic struggles. If too much force is used to forcibly destroy these things, then the local tyrants and evil gentry will use it as an excuse to spread counter-revolutionary propaganda slogans such as "the peasant associations are disrespectful to ancestors," "the peasant associations bully gods and destroy the way," and "the peasant associations advocate communal wives," to destroy the peasant movement. Recently, in Hunan's Xiangtan and Hubei's Yangxin, there have been incidents of landlords using peasants' opposition to destroying Buddhas. This is a clear example. The Buddhas are set up by the peasants, and at a certain time, the peasants will throw them away with their own hands. There is no need for others to do it prematurely. The Communist Party's propaganda policy on these things should be: "Draw the bow but do not release the arrow, and be ready to leap." The Buddhas should be thrown away by the peasants themselves. The temples of chaste women and archways of filial piety should be destroyed by the peasants themselves. It is not right for others to do it for them.

I also propagandized the elimination of superstition in the countryside. My words were:

"Believing in the Eight Characters to walk a good path, believing in Feng Shui to make the tombs auspicious. In the past few months, the local tyrants, evil gentry, corrupt officials, and bribe-takers have all fallen. Is it that a few months ago, the local tyrants, evil gentry, corrupt officials, and bribe-takers were all walking good paths, and their tombs were all auspicious, and in these few months, they suddenly walked bad paths, and their tombs were no longer auspicious? The local tyrants and evil gentry describe the peasant associations' words as: 'It's clever, now it's the commissioners' world. Look, even urinating hits a commissioner.' Indeed, in the city, countryside, labor unions, peasant associations, Kuomintang, Communist Party, there is not one without executive commissioners. Indeed, it is a commissioners' world. But is this also the Eight Characters and tombs' doing? Clever! The countryside's poor devils' Eight Characters suddenly all improved! The tombs also suddenly all became auspicious! Gods? They are very respectable. But without the peasant association, just relying on the Emperor Guan, Guan Yin Bodhisattva, can you overthrow the local tyrants and evil gentry? Those emperors and bodhisattvas are also pitiful. They have been worshipped for hundreds of years, but not a single local tyrant or evil gentry has been overthrown for you! Now you want to reduce rent, I ask you, what method do you have? Believing in gods or believing in the peasant association?"

My words made the peasants laugh.

The eighth point: Popularizing political propaganda

Opening a thousand law and politics schools, can they popularize political education among the poor and remote men, women, old, and young in such a short time, like the political education done by the peasant associations now? I think not. Overthrowing imperialism, overthrowing warlords, overthrowing corrupt officials and bribe-takers, overthrowing local tyrants and evil gentry, these political slogans have truly flown without wings, flying to the faces of countless young, old, men, women, and children in the countryside, directly into their brains, and then from their brains to their mouths. For example, if you see a group of children playing, if you see a child glaring, stomping, waving, and getting angry at another child, you can immediately hear a sharp voice, that is: "Overthrow imperialism!"

In the Xiangtan area, children herding cows start fighting, one becomes Tang Shengzhi, and one becomes Ye Kaixin. After a while, one is defeated, and one chases after, the one chasing is Tang Shengzhi, and the one being chased is Ye Kaixin. The song "Overthrow the powers..." is not only known by almost every child on the street, but even many children in the countryside know how to sing it.

Sun Yat-sen's will is also known by some peasants in the countryside. They took out words like "freedom," "equality," "Three Principles of the People," and "unequal treaties" from that will and applied them to their lives in a somewhat awkward way. A gentleman-like person on the road bumped into a peasant, and the gentleman, with his airs, did not want to give way. The peasant angrily said: "Local tyrant and evil gentry! Do you know the Three Principles of the People?" Near Changsha, vegetable farmers from the suburbs go to the city to sell vegetables and are often bullied by the police. Now, the peasants have found a weapon, and this weapon is the Three Principles of the People. When the police beat and scold the vegetable-selling peasants, the peasants immediately use the Three Principles of the People to resist, and the police have nothing to say. In a district of Xiangtan, the peasant association had a dispute with a village peasant association over a matter, and the chairman of the village peasant association declared: "Oppose the unequal treaty of the district peasant association!"

The popularization of political propaganda in the countryside is all the merit of the Communist Party and the peasant associations. Simple slogans, posters, and speeches have made the peasants feel as if they have all attended a political school, with very broad and rapid effects. According to reports from comrades working in the countryside, political propaganda was very widespread during the three major mass rallies: the anti-British demonstration, the October Revolution commemoration, and the celebration of the victory of the Northern Expedition. In these rallies, political propaganda was held wherever there were peasant associations, mobilizing the entire countryside, with great effects. In the future, what needs to be paid attention to is to use various opportunities to gradually enrich the content of the aforementioned simple slogans and make their meanings clearer.

The ninth point: The peasants' prohibitions

The Communist Party leading the peasant associations has established authority in the countryside, and the peasants have prohibited or restricted things they do not like. The most strictly prohibited are gambling, betting, and opium, these three things.

Gambling: In places where the peasant associations are strong, mahjong, dominoes, and playing cards are all strictly prohibited.

In the Shisi Du area of Xiangtan, a district peasant association once burned a load of mahjong cards.

Running to the countryside, there is no gambling, and those who violate the prohibition are immediately punished, with no leniency.

Betting: The former "gamblers" are now prohibiting betting themselves. In places where the peasant associations are strong, like gambling, it is also clean.

Opium: It is strictly prohibited. The peasant associations order the surrender of opium pipes, and no one dares to disobey. In Liling, an evil gentry did not surrender his opium pipe and was caught and paraded through the village.

The peasants' "opium pipe surrender movement" is not weak compared to the Northern Expedition army's disarming of Wu Peifu and Sun Chuanfang's armies. Many revolutionary army officers' elderly grandfathers, who rely on a "pipe" to save their lives, have all been disarmed by the "long live" (evil gentry's derogatory term for peasants). The "long live" not only prohibit planting and smoking but also prohibit transporting. Opium from Guizhou to Jiangxi via Baojing, Xiangtan, Youxian, and Liling was intercepted and burned. This has led to a conflict with the government's finances. The result is that the provincial peasant association, in order to maintain the Northern Expedition's military funds, ordered the lower-level peasant associations: "Temporarily suspend the prohibition of transportation." But the peasants are not happy.

In addition to the three, the peasants have prohibited or restricted many other things, briefly listed as follows:

Lion dance: A small opera, many places prohibit performances.

Sedans: Many counties have incidents of breaking sedans, especially in Xiangtan. The peasants hate those who ride in sedans the most and always want to break them, but the peasant associations prohibit them. The people running the peasant associations say to the peasants: "You break the sedans, and you are actually saving money for the rich. The sedan bearers will lose their jobs, isn't that harming yourselves?" The peasants thought it over and came up with a new method, which is to greatly increase the sedan bearers' wages to punish the rich.

Making wine and sugar: It is universally prohibited to use grain to make wine and sugar. The wine and sugar shops are in great distress. In the Futingpu area of Hengshan, it is not prohibited to make wine, but the wine price is limited to a very small amount. The wine shops have no money to make, so they have to stop.

Pigs: Limit the number of pigs each family can raise because pigs eat grain.

Chickens and ducks: Xiangtan prohibits raising chickens and ducks, but the women oppose it. In the Yangtang area of Hengshan, each family is limited to raising three, and in the Futingpu area, five. In many places, raising ducks is completely prohibited because ducks not only eat grain but also trample the crops.

Banquets: Luxurious banquets are universally prohibited. In the Shaoshan area of Xiangtan, it was decided that guests can only eat three animals, that is, only eat chicken, fish, and pork. Bamboo shoots, seaweed, and glutinous rice cakes are prohibited. In Hengshan, it was decided to eat eight dishes, not one more. In the Dongsan area of Liling, only five dishes are allowed, in the Beier area, only three meats and three vegetables, and in the Xisan area, inviting spring guests is prohibited. Xiangtan prohibits "egg cake banquets"—a banquet that is not very luxurious. In the Erdu area of Xiangtan, a family had a wedding with an egg cake banquet. The peasants, because he did not follow the prohibition, rushed in and messed it up. In the Jiamo Town of Xiangtan, they implemented not eating good food and used fruit to worship ancestors.

Cows: This is the peasants' treasure. "Those who kill cows will become cows in their next life," it has become a religion, so cows cannot be killed. When the peasants had no power, they could only use religious ideas to oppose killing cows and had no power to prohibit it. After the peasant associations rose up, the power reached the cows, and killing cows in the city was prohibited. In Xiangtan, there were originally six beef shops in the city, now five have closed, leaving only one that kills sick and useless cows. In Hengshan, the entire county has prohibited killing cows. A peasant had a cow that broke its leg, and after asking the peasant association, he dared to kill it. The Chamber of Commerce in Zhuzhou rashly killed a cow, and the peasants went to the street to demand justice. In addition to paying money, they also apologized with firecrackers.

Vagrant life: Such as spring festivals, worshipping the earth, and lion dances. Liling decided to prohibit them. Some counties prohibit them, and some naturally disappear with no one doing these things. There is a kind of "strong beggars" also known as "vagrants," who are usually very fierce, but now they also have to submit to the peasant associations. In the Shaoshan area of Xiangtan, there is a Rain God Temple, which has always gathered vagrants, and no one is afraid. After the peasant associations rose up, they quietly left. In the same area, the Lake Dike Village peasant association caught three vagrants to carry soil and burn bricks. The custom of paying New Year's visits is prohibited.

In addition, there are many small prohibitions in various places, such as Liling prohibiting Nuo gods from going on pilgrimages, prohibiting buying southern goods and fruit to send gifts, prohibiting burning clothes in the middle of the year, and prohibiting sticking lucky signs in the New Year. In the Gushui area of Xiangtan, water pipes are also prohibited. In the Erdu area, firecrackers and three-barrel guns are prohibited, with a fine of $1.20 for setting off firecrackers and $2.40 for firing guns. In the Qidu and Ershi Du areas, performing rituals is prohibited. In the Shiba Du area, sending funeral money is prohibited. There are many such prohibitions, collectively known as the peasants' prohibitions.

These prohibitions contain two important meanings: First, they are a resistance to social evils, such as prohibiting gambling, betting, and opium, which are products of the landlords' evil political environment. Once the landlords' power is overthrown, these things are also swept away. Second, they are a self-defense against the exploitation of city merchants, such as prohibiting banquets, prohibiting buying southern goods and fruit to send gifts, etc. Because industrial products are very expensive, and agricultural products are very cheap, the peasants are extremely poor and suffer greatly from merchants' exploitation. They have to advocate frugality to defend themselves. As for the aforementioned peasants' obstruction of grain exports, it is because the poor peasants themselves do not have enough grain to eat and still have to buy from the market, so they do not allow the grain price to rise. These are all due to the peasants' poverty and the contradiction between the city and the countryside, and not because the peasants reject industrial products and city-countryside trade, implementing so-called Eastern culturalism. For economic self-defense, the peasants must organize cooperatives and implement joint purchasing and consumption. They also need the government's assistance to enable the peasant associations to organize credit (loan) cooperatives. In this way, the peasants will not have to use the obstruction of grain as a method to limit food prices, nor will they use the rejection of certain industrial products entering the countryside as a method of economic self-defense.

The tenth point: Clearing out bandits

From Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu onwards, up to the Qing Dynasty emperors and the Republic of China presidents, I think there has never been a ruler with the power to clear out bandits like the peasant associations now. What bandits, in places where the peasant associations are strong, even their shadows are not seen. It's strange, in many places, even petty thieves who steal small vegetables are gone. Some places still have petty thieves. As for bandits, in all the counties I have visited, they have completely disappeared, even in places that were once notorious for bandits. The reason: First, the peasant association members are everywhere, and with a call, hundreds will respond, and the bandits have nowhere to hide. Second, after the peasant movement rose up, the price of grain was cheap, and last spring, a load of grain that was six yuan, last winter was only two yuan, so the food problem is not as serious as before. Third, the secret societies have joined the peasant associations, and in the peasant associations, they can openly and legally show off their heroism, vent their grievances, and the secret organizations of "mountain, hall, incense, and water" have no need to exist. Killing pigs and sheep, heavy fines and punishments, venting their grievances on the local tyrants and evil gentry class, they have vented enough. Fourth, various armies are recruiting soldiers, and many "unruly elements" have gone. Therefore, with the rise of the peasant movement, banditry has disappeared. On this point, the gentry and rich also sympathize with the peasant associations. Their argument is: "Peasant associations? To be honest, they have a little bit of good."

On the prohibition of gambling, betting, opium, and clearing out bandits, the peasant associations have gained the sympathy of the general public.

The eleventh point: Abolishing oppressive taxes

The country is not yet unified, and the power of imperialism and warlords has not been overthrown, so the peasants' heavy burden of government taxes and levies, in other words, the military expenses of the revolutionary army, still cannot be lifted. However, the oppressive taxes such as the land tax imposed by the local tyrants and evil gentry on the peasants have been abolished or at least reduced due to the rise of the peasant movement and the fall of the local tyrants and evil gentry. This should also be counted as one of the merits of the peasant associations.

The twelfth point: Cultural movement

In China, only the landlords have culture, and the peasants do not have culture. However, the landlords' culture is created by the peasants because the things that create landlords' culture are not others, but precisely the blood and sweat taken from the peasants. China has ninety percent of the people who have not received cultural education, and the largest part of this is the peasants. Once the landlords' power in the countryside is overthrown, the peasants' cultural movement begins. Look, the peasants have always hated schools, but now they are working hard to establish night schools. "Western schools," the peasants have always disliked them. When I was a student, I went back to the countryside and saw the peasants opposing "Western schools," and I, as a "Western student" and "Western teacher," also stood on the side of Western schools' interests, always feeling that the peasants were somewhat wrong. In the fourteenth year of the Republic, I lived in the countryside for half a year. At that time, I was a Communist Party member and had a Marxist perspective, and only then did I realize that I was wrong, and the peasants' logic was correct. The textbooks of rural primary schools are all about urban things and do not meet the needs of the countryside. The attitude of primary school teachers towards peasants is also very bad, not only are they not helpers of the peasants, but they have become people the peasants dislike. Therefore, the peasants welcome private schools (they call them "Han schools") and do not welcome schools (they call them "Western schools"), and they welcome private school teachers and do not welcome primary school teachers. Now they are establishing night schools, naming them "peasant schools." Some have already been established, and some are being prepared, with an average of one school per village. They are very enthusiastic about establishing such schools, believing that such schools are truly theirs. The funds for night schools are taken from superstitious public funds, ancestral hall public funds, and other idle public funds. These public funds, the county education bureau wants to take them to establish national schools, that is, the "Western schools" that do not meet the peasants' needs. The peasants want to take them to establish peasant schools. The result of the dispute is that both sides get some, and in some places, the peasants get all. The development of the peasant movement has rapidly improved the peasants' cultural level. In a short time, the entire province will have tens of thousands of schools emerging in the countryside, unlike the intellectual class and the so-called "educators," who shout "popularize education," shouting and shouting, it is still an empty talk.

The thirteenth point: Cooperative movement

Cooperatives, especially consumption, sales, and credit cooperatives, are indeed what the peasants need. They are exploited by merchants when buying goods, suppressed by merchants when selling agricultural products, and exploited by usurers when borrowing money and grain. They urgently need to solve these three problems. Last winter, when the war broke out on the Yangtze River, salt was expensive in Hunan, and the peasants organized many cooperatives for the need for salt. Landlords "control loans," and peasants, because of borrowing money, tried to organize "loan associations," which are everywhere. The big problem is that there is no detailed and regular organization method. The cooperatives organized by peasants in various places often do not conform to the principles of cooperatives, so the comrades doing peasant work always eagerly ask for "regulations." If there is appropriate guidance, the cooperative movement can develop with the development of the peasant associations in various places.

The fourteenth point: Repairing roads and dikes

This is also a merit of the peasant associations. Before the peasant associations, the roads in the countryside were very bad. Without money, they could not be repaired, and those with money did not want to contribute, so they had to let it be. A little repair was also done as a charitable deed, collecting a few from those who "want to accumulate merit," and repairing some narrow and thin roads. The peasant associations rose up, issued orders, three chi, five chi, seven chi, ten chi, according to the road's suitability, divided into grades and widths, and ordered the landlords along the road to repair a section each. The order was issued, and who dared not obey? In a short time, many walkable roads appeared. This is not a charitable deed but is done by force, but this bit of force is really forced quite well. Dikes are the same, the heartless landlords always want to take things from the tenants, but they do not want to spend a few dollars to repair the dikes, letting them dry up and starve the tenants to death, but they only know how to collect rent. With the peasant associations, they can issue orders to force the landlords to repair the dikes. When the landlords do not repair, the peasant associations very politely say to the landlords: "Good! You do not repair, you provide grain, one basket per labor!" The landlords find it not worth it to provide one basket of grain per labor, so they quickly repair it themselves. Therefore, many bad dikes have become good dikes.

In summary, the above fourteen points are all things done by the peasants under the command of the peasant associations. From the basic spirit and revolutionary significance, please think, is there anything bad? I think, only the local tyrants and evil gentry will say these things are bad. It is strange that news from the Nanchang side says that Chiang Kai-shek and Zhang Jianjiang's opinions are not pleased with the actions of the Hunan peasants. The right-wing leaders of Hunan, Liu Yuezhi and others, have the same opinion as Chiang and Zhang, all saying: "This is simply communizing!" I think, if there is no bit of communizing, what kind of national revolution is it? Talking about "arousing the masses" every day, but when the masses rise up, they are afraid to death, what is the difference between this and the story of the Leaf Prince who loved dragons?

(1) Hunan is the center of the national peasant movement at that time.
(2) Zhao Hengti is the proxy of the Beiyang warlords ruling Hunan at that time. In 1926, the Northern Expedition army overthrew his rule.
(3) The Xinhai Revolution is the revolution in 1911 that overthrew the Qing Dynasty's autocratic rule. In that year, on October 10th, part of the new army, under the instigation of the revolutionary parties of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, rebelled in Wuhan. Later, various provinces also rebelled, and the Qing Dynasty's rule quickly collapsed. On January 1st, 1912, the Provisional Government of the Republic of China was established in Nanjing, and Sun Yat-sen was elected as the Provisional President. This revolution was achieved through the alliance of the bourgeoisie, peasants, workers, and urban petty bourgeoisie, but this revolution also failed due to the compromising nature of the revolutionary leadership, did not give the peasants real benefits, and accepted the pressure of imperialism and feudal forces, so the power fell into the hands of the Beiyang warlord Yuan Shikai, and the revolution failed.
(4) "Overcorrecting" is an idiom, originally meaning to correct a mistake but exceed the appropriate limit. But in the past, people often used this phrase to restrict people's activities, that is, only allowing activities within the scope of correcting old rules, and not allowing the complete destruction of old rules. Activities within the scope of correcting old rules are called "correct," and if old rules are completely destroyed, it is called "overcorrecting." This is also the theory of the reformists and opportunists within the revolutionary camp. Mao Zedong here refutes this kind of reformist theory. The so-called "overcorrecting is necessary to correct a mistake, and not overcorrecting cannot correct a mistake" means that to end the old feudal order, one must use the masses' revolutionary methods, not the correcting—reforming methods.
(5) In the winter of 1926 and the spring of 1927, when the Northern Expedition army reached the Yangtze River basin, Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary face had not yet been fully exposed, and the peasant masses still regarded him as a revolutionary. The landlords and rich peasants were not happy with him, spreading rumors that the Northern Expedition army was defeated and Chiang Kai-shek was injured. Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary face was fully exposed after the April 12th counter-revolutionary coup in Shanghai and other places, carrying out the massacre of workers, suppressing peasants, and attacking the Communist Party. From this time on, the landlords and rich peasants took a supportive attitude towards him.
(6) Guangdong is the earliest revolutionary base area during the first domestic revolutionary war.
(7) Wu Peifu is a famous representative of the Beiyang warlords, and in 1923, he was known for the infamous election of the president Cao Kun, both belonging to the Zhili clique of the Beiyang warlords, and they were known as "Cao Wu." Wu Peifu, after defeating the Anhui clique warlord Duan Qirui in 1920, controlled the political situation of the Beiyang warlord government, acting as an agent for British and American imperialism. He killed many workers on strike on the Jinghan Railway on February 7, 1923. In the war with Zhang Zuolin in 1924 (generally known as the "Zhili-Fengtian War"), he was defeated, losing the political power of Beijing. But in 1926, with the instigation of Japanese and British imperialism, he joined forces with Zhang Zuolin again, and thus rose again. The Northern Expedition army, starting from Guangdong, first directly defeated Wu Peifu.
(8) The Three Principles of the People are the principles of nationalism, democracy, and livelihood proposed by Sun Yat-sen for the bourgeois revolution in China. In 1924, Sun Yat-sen, in the "Declaration of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang," reinterpreted the Three Principles of the People, interpreting nationalism as opposing imperialism and expressing active support for the workers' and peasants' movements. The old Three Principles of the People thus developed into the new Three Principles of the People of the three major policies of allying with Russia, allying with the Communist Party, and aiding the workers and peasants. This new Three Principles of the People became the political basis for the cooperation between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang during the first domestic revolutionary war. Please refer to the "New Democraticism" tenth section.
(9) It is not appropriate to allow rich peasants to join the peasant associations. During the 1927 period, the peasant masses did not know this.
(10) The "extremely poor" mentioned by Comrade Mao Zedong here refers to hired laborers (rural proletarians) and rural vagrant proletarians.
(11) Refers to the rural semi-proletariat.
(12) Refers to the Kuomintang county party branch at that time.
(13) Yuan Zuming is a Guizhou warlord who occupied Xiangxi at that time.
(14) The "du" and "tuan" in Hunan are equivalent to "district" and "village." The old-style "du" and "tuan" village political organs are tools for landlords to rule peasants. The heads of "du" and "tuan" are called "duzong" and "tuantou."
(15) The title of the military governor is the title of the military head set up by the Beiyang warlords in various provinces. The "military governor" actually controls the military and political power of the entire province, is a dictator within the scope of the province, and colludes with imperialists to implement local feudal military separatism.
(16) The "household defense reserve team" is a kind of rural armed organization at that time. "Household" means that almost every household participates. In 1927, after the revolution failed, many places' "household defense teams" were seized by the landlords and became counter-revolutionary armed organizations.
(17) At that time, under the leadership of the Kuomintang Central in Wuhan, many local Kuomintang county party branches were organizations that implemented Sun Yat-sen's three major policies of allying with Russia, allying with the Communist Party, and aiding the workers and peasants, and were revolutionary alliances of Communist Party members, left-wing Kuomintang members, and other revolutionaries.
(18) This sentence is quoted from "Mencius," meaning that a good teacher draws the bow but does not release the arrow, and is ready to leap. Here it is used to compare the Communist Party leading the peasants to obtain sufficient anti-superstition awareness, and then wait for the peasants to voluntarily and spontaneously break away from superstition, but not to issue orders or replace the peasants to break away from superstition.
(19) Tang Shengzhi is a general who participated in the Northern Expedition at that time. Ye Kaixin is a general who opposed the revolution at that time.
(20) Sun Chuanfang, the warlord who ruled the five provinces of Jiangnan at that time, the executioner of the Shanghai workers' uprising. His main forces were defeated by the Northern Expedition army in winter 1926 in Nanchang and Jiujiang, Jiangxi.
(21) Eastern culturalism is a reactionary ideology that advocates preserving the backward agriculture and feudal culture of the East and rejects modern science and civilization.
(22) "Mountain, hall, incense, and water" are some sectarian names of original secret societies.
(23) Refers to the land tax imposed by the gentry power in addition to the original land tax.
(24) The Northern Expedition army occupied Nanchang in November 1926. Chiang Kai-shek took the opportunity to set up his headquarters there, gathering right-wing Kuomintang members and some Beiyang warlords' politicians, colluding with imperialism, and plotting counter-revolutionary conspiracies to oppose the revolutionary Wuhan at that time, and finally launched the April 12th counter-revolutionary coup and massacre.
(25) Zhang Jianjiang is one of the right-wing leaders of the Kuomintang at that time, a strategist for Chiang Kai-shek.
(26) Liu Yuezhi is the head of an important anti-Communist organization in Hunan at that time.
(27) The story of the Leaf Prince who loved dragons is a story in the "New Discourses" written by Liu Xiang during the Han Dynasty: "The Leaf Prince loved dragons, drawing dragons with hooks, carving dragons with chisels, and carving dragon patterns on the walls and rooms. Then the heavenly dragon heard about it and came down, peeking its head through the window and placing its tail in the hall. The Leaf Prince saw it and fled in fear, losing his soul and spirit, and his five colors were in disarray. This shows that the Leaf Prince did not love dragons but loved things that looked like dragons but were not dragons." Here, Comrade Mao Zedong uses it to compare Chiang Kai-shek and others who talk about revolution but are actually afraid of revolution and oppose revolution.

　　湖南农民运动考察报告
   （一九二七年三月）
    毛泽东
    毛泽东同志此文是为了答复当时党内党外的右倾压力而写的。为了答复这个问题，毛泽东同志到湖南做了三十二天的考察工作，并写了这一篇报告。当时党内以陈独秀为首的右倾机会主义者，不愿意接受毛泽东同志的意见，而坚持自己的错误见解。他们的错误，主要地是被国民党的反动潮流所吓倒，不敢支持已经起来和正在起来的伟大的农民革命斗争。为了迁就国民党，他们宁愿抛弃农民这个最主要的同盟军，使工人阶级和共产党处于孤立无援的地位。一九二七年夏季国民党之所以敢于叛变，发动“清党运动”和反人民的战争，主要地就是乘了共产党的这个弱点。
                                      毛泽东选集出版委员会
            农民问题的严重性
    我这回到湖南〔一〕，实地考察了湘潭、湘乡、衡山、醴陵、长沙五县的情况。从一月四日起，至二月五日止，共三十二天，在乡下，在县城，召集有经验的农民和农运工作同志开调查会，仔细听他们的报告，所得材料不少。许多农民运动的道理，和在汉口、长沙从绅士阶级那里听得的道理，完全相反。许多奇事，则见所未见，闻所未闻。我想这些情形，很多地方都有。所有各种反对农民运动的议论，都必须迅速矫正。革命当局对农民运动的各种错误处置，必须迅速变更。这样，才于革命前途有所补益。因为目前农民运动的兴起是一个极大的问题。很短的时间内，将有几万万农民从中国中部、南部和北部各省起来，其势如暴风骤雨，迅猛异常，无论什么大的力量都将压抑不住。他们将冲决一切束缚他们的罗网，朝着解放的路上迅跑。一切帝国主义、军阀、贪官污吏、土豪劣绅，都将被他们葬入坟墓。一切革命的党派，革命的同志，都将在他们面前受他们的检验而决定弃取。站在他们的前头领导他们呢？还是站在他们的后头指手画脚地批评他们呢？还是站在他们的对面反对他们呢？每个中国人对于这三项都有选择的自由，不过时局将强迫你迅速地选择罢了。
            组织起来
    湖南的农民运动，就湘中、湘南已发达的各县来说，大约分为两个时期。去年一月至九月为第一时期，即组织时期。此时期内，一月至六月为秘密活动时期，七月至九月革命军驱逐赵恒惕〔二〕，为公开活动时期。此时期内，农会会员的人数总计不过三、四十万，能直接领导的群众也不过百余万，在农村中还没有什么斗争，因此各界对它也没有什么批评。因为农会会员能作向导，作侦探，作挑夫，北伐军的军官们还有说几句好话的。十月至今年一月为第二时期，即革命时期。农会会员激增到二百万，能直接领导的群众增加到一千万。因为农民入农会大多数每家只写一个人的名字，故会员二百万，群众便有约一千万。在湖南农民全数中，差不多组织了一半。如湘潭、湘乡、浏阳、长沙、醴陵、宁乡、平江、湘阴、衡山、衡阳、耒阳、郴县、安化等县，差不多全体农民都集合在农会的组织中，都立在农会领导之下。农民既已有了广大的组织，便开始行动起来，于是在四个月中造成一个空前的农村大革命。
            打倒土豪劣绅，一切权力归农会
    农民的主要攻击目标是土豪劣绅，不法地主，旁及各种宗法的思想和制度，城里的贪官污吏，乡村的恶劣习惯。这个攻击的形势，简直是急风暴雨，顺之者存，违之者灭。其结果，把几千年封建地主的特权，打得个落花流水。地主的体面威风，扫地以尽。地主权力既倒，农会便成了唯一的权力机关，真正办到了人们所谓“一切权力归农会”。连两公婆吵架的小事，也要到农民协会去解决。一切事情，农会的人不到场，便不能解决。农会在乡村简直独裁一切，真是“说得出，做得到”。外界的人只能说农会好，不能说农会坏。土豪劣绅，不法地主，则完全被停止了发言权，没有人敢说半个不字。在农会威力之下，土豪劣绅们头等的跑到上海，二等的跑到汉口，三等的跑到长沙，四等的跑到县城，五等以下土豪劣绅崽子则在乡里向农会投降。
    “我出十块钱，请你们准我进农民协会。”小劣绅说。
    “嘻！谁要你的臭钱！”农民这样回答。
    好些中小地主、富农乃至中农，从前反对农会的，此刻求入农会不可得。我到各处，常常遇到这种人，这样向我求情：“请省里来的委员作保！”
    前清地方造丁口册，有正册、另册二种，好人入正册，匪盗等坏人入另册。现在有些地方的农民便拿了这事吓那些从前反对农会的人：“把他们入另册！”
    那些人怕入另册，便多方设法求入农会，一心要想把他们的名字写上那农会的册子才放心。但他们往往遭农会严厉拒绝，所以他们总是悬心吊胆地过日子；摒在农会的门外，好像无家可归的样子，乡里话叫做“打零”。总之，四个月前被一般人看不起的所谓“农民会”，现在却变成顶荣耀的东西。从前拜倒在绅士权力下面的人，现在却拜倒在农民权力之下。无论什么人，都承认去年十月以前和十月以后是两个世界。
            “糟得很”和“好得很”
    农民在乡里造反，搅动了绅士们的酣梦。乡里消息传到城里来，城里的绅士立刻大哗。我初到长沙时，会到各方面的人，听到许多的街谈巷议。从中层以上社会至国民党右派，无不一言以蔽之曰：“糟得很。”即使是很革命的人罢，受了那班“糟得很”派的满城风雨的议论所压迫，他闭眼一想乡村的情况，也就气馁起来，没有法子否认这“糟”字。很进步的人也只是说：“这是革命过程中应有的事，虽则是糟。”总而言之，无论什么人都无法完全否认这“糟”字。实在呢，如前所说，乃是广大的农民群众起来完成他们的历史使命，乃是乡村的民主势力起来打翻乡村的封建势力。宗法封建性的土豪劣绅，不法地主阶级，是几千年专制政治的基础，帝国主义、军阀、贪官污吏的墙脚。打翻这个封建势力，乃是国民革命的真正目标。孙中山先生致力国民革命凡四十年，所要做而没有做到的事，农民在几个月内做到了。这是四十年乃至几千年未曾成就过的奇勋。这是好得很。完全没有什么“糟”，完全不是什么“糟得很”。“糟得很”，明明是站在地主利益方面打击农民起来的理论，明明是地主阶级企图保存封建旧秩序，阻碍建设民主新秩序的理论，明明是反革命的。每个革命的同志，都不应该跟着瞎说。你若是一个确定了革命观点的人，而且是跑到乡村里去看过一遍的，你必定觉到一种从来未有的痛快，无数万成群的奴隶——农民，在那里打翻他们的吃人的仇敌。农民的举动，完全是对的，他们的举动好得很！“好得很”是农民及其他革命派的理论。一切革命同志须知：国民革命需要一个大的农村变动。辛亥革命〔三〕没有这个变动，所以失败了。现在有了这个变动，乃是革命完成的重要因素。一切革命同志都要拥护这个变动，否则他就站到反革命立场上去了。
            所谓“过分”的问题
    又有一般人说：“农会虽要办，但是现在农会的举动未免太过分了。”这是中派的议论。实际怎样呢？的确的，农民在乡里颇有一点子“乱来”。农会权力无上，不许地主说话，把地主的威风扫光。这等于将地主打翻在地，再踏上一只脚。“把你入另册！”向土豪劣绅罚款捐款，打轿子。反对农会的土豪劣绅的家里，一群人涌进去，杀猪出谷。土豪劣绅的小姐少奶奶的牙床上，也可以踏上去滚一滚。动不动捉人戴高帽子游乡，“劣绅！今天认得我们！”为所欲为，一切反常，竟在乡村造成一种恐怖现象。这就是一些人的所谓“过分”，所谓“矫枉过正”，所谓“未免太不成话”。这派议论貌似有理，其实也是错的。第一，上述那些事，都是土豪劣绅、不法地主自己逼出来的。土豪劣绅、不法地主，历来凭借势力称霸，践踏农民，农民才有这种很大的反抗。凡是反抗最力、乱子闹得最大的地方，都是土豪劣绅、不法地主为恶最甚的地方。农民的眼睛，全然没有错的。谁个劣，谁个不劣，谁个最甚，谁个稍次，谁个惩办要严，谁个处罚从轻，农民都有极明白的计算，罚不当罪的极少。第二，革命不是请客吃饭，不是做文章，不是绘画绣花，不能那样雅致，那样从容不迫，文质彬彬，那样温良恭俭让。革命是暴动，是一个阶级推翻一个阶级的暴烈的行动。农村革命是农民阶级推翻封建地主阶级的权力的革命。农民若不用极大的力量，决不能推翻几千年根深蒂固的地主权力。农村中须有一个大的革命热潮，才能鼓动成千成万的群众，形成一个大的力量。上面所述那些所谓“过分”的举动，都是农民在乡村中由大的革命热潮鼓动出来的力量所造成的。这些举动，在农民运动第二时期（革命时期）是非常之需要的。在第二时期内，必须建立农民的绝对权力。必须不准人恶意地批评农会。必须把一切绅权都打倒，把绅士打在地下，甚至用脚踏上。所有一切所谓“过分”的举动，在第二时期都有革命的意义。质言之，每个农村都必须造成一个短时期的恐怖现象，非如此决不能镇压农村反革命派的活动，决不能打倒绅权。矫枉必须过正，不过正不能矫枉〔四〕。这一派的议论，表面上和前一派不同，但其实质则和前一派同站在一个观点上，依然是拥护特权阶级利益的地主理论。这种理论，阻碍农民运动的兴起，其结果破坏了革命，我们不能不坚决地反对。
            所谓“痞子运动”
    国民党右派说：“农民运动是痞子运动，是惰农运动。”这种议论，在长沙颇盛行。我跑到乡下，见绅士们说：“农民协会可以办，但是现在办事人不行，要换人啦。”这种议论，和右派的话是一个意思，都是说农运可做（因农民运动已起来，无人敢说不可做），但是现在做农运的人不行，尤其痛恨下级农民协会办事人，说他们都是些“痞子”。总而言之，一切从前为绅士们看不起的人，一切被绅士们打在泥沟里，在社会上没有了立足地位，没有了发言权的人，现在居然伸起头来了。不但伸起头，而且掌权了。他们在乡农民协会（农协的最下级）称王，乡农民协会在他们手里弄成很凶的东西了。他们举起他们那粗黑的手，加在绅士们头上了。他们用绳子捆绑了劣绅，给他们戴上高帽子，牵着游乡（湘潭、湘乡叫游团，醴陵叫游垅）。他们那粗重无情的斥责声，每天都有些送进绅士们的耳朵里去。他们发号施令，指挥一切。他们站在一切人之上——从前站在一切人之下，所以叫做反常。
            革命先锋
    对于一件事或一种人，有相反的两种看法，便出来相反的两种议论。“糟得很”和“好得很”，“痞子”和“革命先锋”，都是适例。
    前面说了农民成就了多年未曾成就的革命事业，农民做了国民革命的重要工作。但是这种革命大业，革命重要工作，是不是农民全体做的呢？不是的。农民中有富农、中农、贫农三种。三种状况不同，对于革命的观感也各别。当第一时期，富农耳里听得的是所谓江西一败如水，蒋介石打伤了脚〔五〕坐飞机回广东〔六〕了。吴佩孚〔七〕重新占了岳州。农民协会必定立不久，三民主义〔八〕也兴不起，因为这是所谓从来没有的东西。乡农民协会的办事人（多属所谓“痞子”之类），拿了农会的册子，跨进富农的大门，对富农说：“请你进农民协会。”富农怎样回答呢？“农民协会么？我在这里住了几十年，种了几十年田，没有见过什么农民协会，也吃饭。我劝你们不办的好！”富农中态度好点的这样说：“什么农民协会，砍脑壳会，莫害人！”富农中态度恶劣的这样说。新奇得很，农民协会居然成立了好几个月，而且敢于反对绅士。邻近的绅士因为不肯缴鸦片枪，被农民协会捉了去游乡。县城里并且杀了大绅士，例如湘潭的晏容秋，宁乡的杨致泽。十月革命纪念大会，反英大会，北伐胜利总庆祝，每乡都有上万的农民举起大小旗帜，杂以扁担锄头，浩浩荡荡，出队示威。这时，富农才开始惶惑起来。在北伐胜利总庆祝中，他们听见说，九江也打开了，蒋介石没有伤脚，吴佩孚究竟打败了。而且“三民主义万岁”，“农民协会万岁”，“农民万岁”等等，明明都写在“红绿告示”（标语）上面。“农民万岁，这些人也算作万岁么？”富农表示，很大的惶惑。农会于是神气十足了。农会的人对富农说：“把你们入另册！”或者说“再过一个月，入会的每人会费十块钱！”在这样的形势之下，富农才慢慢地进了农会〔九〕，有些是缴过五角钱或一块钱（本来只要一百钱）入会费的，有些是托人说情才邀了农会允许的。亦有好些顽固党，至今还没有入农会。富农入会，多把他那家里一个六七十岁的老头子到农会去上一个名字，因为他们始终怕“抽丁”。入会后，也并不热心替农会做事，他们的态度始终是消极的。
    中农呢？他们的态度是游移的，他们想到革命对他们没有什么大的好处。他们锅里有米煮，没有人半夜里敲门来讨账。他们也根据从来有没有的道理，独自皱着眉头在那里想：“农民协会果然立得起来么？”“三民主义果然兴得起来么？”他们的结论是：“怕未必！”他们以为这全决于天意：“办农民会，晓得天意顺不顺咧？”在第一时期内，农会的人拿了册子，进了中农的门，对着中农说道：“请你加入农民协会！”中农回答道：“莫性急啦！”一直到第二时期，农会势力大盛，中农方加入农会。他们在农会比富农好，但暂时还不甚积极，他们还要看一看。农会争取中农入会，向他们多作解释工作，是完全必要的。
    乡村中一向苦战奋斗的主要力量是贫农。从秘密时期到公开时期，贫农都在那里积极奋斗。他们最听共产党的领导。他们和土豪劣绅是死对头，他们毫不迟疑地向土豪劣绅营垒进攻。他们对着富农说：“我们早进了农会，你们为什么还迟疑？”富农带着讥笑的声调说道：“你们上无片瓦，下无插针之地，有什么不进农会！”的确，贫农们不怕失掉什么。他们中间有很多人，确实是“上无片瓦，下无插针之地”，他们有什么不进农会？据长沙的调查：乡村人口中，贫农占百分之七十，中农占百分之二十，地主和富农占百分之十。百分之七十的贫农中，又分赤贫、次贫二类。全然无业，即既无土地，又无资金，完全失去生活根据，不得不出外当兵，或出去做工，或打流当乞丐的，都是“赤贫”〔一○〕占百分之二十。半无业，即略有土地，或略有资金，但吃的多，收的少，终年在劳碌愁苦中过生活的，如手工工人、佃农（富佃除外）、半自耕农等，都是“次贫”〔一一〕，占百分之五十。这个贫农大群众，合共占乡村人口百分之七十，乃是农民协会的中坚，打倒封建势力的先锋，成就那多年未曾成就的革命大业的元勋。没有贫农阶级（照绅士的话说，没有“痞子”），决不能造成现时乡村的革命状态，决不能打倒土豪劣绅，完成民主革命。贫农，因为最革命，所以他们取得了农会的领导权。所有最下一级农民协会的委员长、委员，在第一第二两个时期中，几乎全数是他们（衡山县乡协职员，赤贫阶层占百分之五十，次贫阶层占百分之四十，穷苦知识分子占百分之十）。这个贫农领导，是非常之需要的。没有贫农，便没有革命。若否认他们，便是否认革命。若打击他们，便是打击革命。他们的革命大方向始终没有错。他们损伤了土豪劣绅的体面。他们打翻了大小土豪劣绅在地上，并且踏上一只脚。他们在革命期内的许多所谓“过分”举动，实在正是革命的需要。湖南有些县的县政府、县党部〔一二〕和县农会，已经做了若干错处，竟有循地主之请，派兵拘捕下级农会职员的。衡山、湘乡二县的监狱里，关了好多个乡农协会委员长、委员。这个错误非常之大，助长了反动派的气焰。只要看拘捕了农协委员长、委员，当地的不法地主们便大高兴，反动空气便大增高，就知道这事是否错误。我们要反对那些所谓“痞子运动”、“惰农运动”的反革命议论，尤其要注意不可做出帮助土豪劣绅打击贫农阶级的错误行动。事实上，贫农领袖中，从前虽有些确是有缺点的，但是现在多数都变好了。他们自己在那里努力禁牌赌，清盗匪。农会势盛，地方牌赌禁绝，匪患潜踪。有些地方真个道不拾遗，夜不闭户。据衡山的调查，贫农领袖百人中八十五人都变得很好，很能干，很努力。只有百分之十五，尚有些不良习惯。这只能叫做“少数不良分子”，决不能跟着土豪劣绅的口白，笼统地骂“痞子”。要解决这“少数不良分子”的问题，也只能在农会整顿纪律的口号之下，对群众做宣传，对他们本人进行训练，把农会的纪律整好，决不能随便派兵捉人，损失贫农阶级的信仰，助长土豪劣绅的气势。这一点是非常要注意的。
            十四件大事
    一般指摘农会的人说农会做了许多坏事。我在前面已经指出，农民打土豪劣绅这件事完全是革命行为，并没有什么可指摘。但是农民所做的事很多，为了答复人们的指摘，我们须得把农民所有的行动过细检查一遍，逐一来看他们的所作所为究竟是怎么样。我把几个月来农民的行动分类总计起来，农民在农民协会领导之下总共作了十四件大事，如下所记。
        第一件  将农民组织在农会里
    这是农民所做的第一件大事。像湘潭、湘乡、衡山这样的县，差不多所有的农民都组织起来了，几乎没有那一只“角暗里”的农民没有起来，这是第一等。有些县，农民组织起来了一大部分，尚有一小部分没有组织，如益阳、华容等县，这是第二等。有些县，农民组织起来了一小部分，大部分尚未组织起来，如城步、零陵等县，这是第三等。湘西一带，在袁祖铭〔一三〕势力之下，农会宣传未到，许多县的农民还全未组织起来，这是第四等。大概以长沙为中心的湘中各县最发展，湘南各县次之，湘西还在开始组织中。据去年十一月省农民协会统计，全省七十五县中，三十七县有了组织，会员人数一百三十六万七千七百二十七人。此数中，约有一百万，是去年十月、十一月两个月内农会势力大盛时期组织的，九月以前还不过三四十万人。现又经过十二月、一月两个月，农运正大发展。截至一月底止，会员人数至少满了二百万。因入会一家多只登记一人，平均每家以五口计，群众便约有一千万。这种惊人的加速度的发展，是所以使一切土豪劣绅贪官污吏孤立，使社会惊为前后两个世界，使农村造成大革命的原因。这是农民在农协领导之下所做的第一件大事。
            第二件  政治上打击地主
    农民有了组织之后，第一个行动，便是从政治上把地主阶级特别是土豪劣绅的威风打下去，即是从农村的社会地位上把地主权力打下去，把农民权力长上来。这是一个极严重极紧要的斗争。这个斗争是第二时期即革命时期的中心斗争。这个斗争不胜利，一切经济斗争，如减租、减息、资金、土地等等，决无胜利之可能。湖南许多地方，像湘乡、衡山、湘潭等县，地主权力完全推翻，形成了农民的独一权力，自无问题。但是醴陵等县，尚有一部分地方（如醴陵之西南两区），表面上地主权力低于农民权力，实际上因为政治斗争不激烈，地主权力还隐隐和农民权力对抗。这些地方，还不能说农民已得了政治的胜利，还须加劲作政治斗争，至地主权力被农民完全打下去为止。综计农民从政治上打击地主的方法有如下各项：
    清算。土豪劣绅经手地方公款，多半从中侵蚀，账目不清。这回农民拿了清算的题目，打翻了很多的土豪劣绅。好多地方组织了清算委员会，专门向土豪劣绅算账，土豪劣绅看了这样的机关就打颤。这样的清算运动，在农民运动起来的各县做得很普遍，意义不重在追回款子，重在宣布土豪劣绅的罪状，把土豪劣绅的政治地位和社会地位打下去。
    罚款。清算结果，发现舞弊，或从前有鱼肉农民的劣迹，或现在有破坏农会的行为，或违禁牌赌，或不缴烟枪。在这些罪名之下，农民议决，某土豪罚款若干，某劣绅罚款若干，自数十元至数千元不等。被农民罚过的人，自然体面扫地。
    捐款。向为富不仁的地主捐款救济贫民，办合作社，办农民贷款所，或作他用。捐款也是一种惩罚，不过较罚款为轻。地主为免祸计，自动地捐款给农会的，亦颇不少。
    小质问。遇有破坏农会的言论行动而罪状较轻的，则邀集多人涌入其家，提出比较不甚严重的质问。结果，多要写个“休息字”，写明从此终止破坏农会名誉的言论行动了事。
    大示威。统率大众，向着和农会结仇的土豪劣绅示威，在他家里吃饭，少不得要杀猪出谷，此类事颇不少。最近湘潭马家河，有率领一万五千群众向六个劣绅问罪，延时四日，杀猪百三十余个的事。示威的结果，多半要罚款。
    戴高帽子游乡。这种事各地做得很多。把土豪劣绅戴上一顶纸扎的高帽子，在那帽子上面写上土豪某某或劣绅某某字样，用绳子牵着，前后簇拥着一大群人。也有敲打铜锣，高举旗帜，引人注目的。这种处罚，最使土豪劣绅颤栗。戴过一次高帽子的，从此颜面扫地，做不起人。故有钱的多愿罚款，不愿戴高帽子。但农民不依时，还是要戴。有一个乡农会很巧妙，捉了一个劣绅来，声言今天要给他戴高帽子。劣绅于是吓黑了脸。但是，农会议决，今天不给他戴高帽子。因为今天给他戴过了，这劣绅横了心，不畏罪了，不如放他回去，等日再戴。那劣绅不知何日要戴高帽子，每日在家放心不下，坐卧不宁。
    关进县监狱。这是比戴高帽子更重的罪。把土豪劣绅捉了，送进知事公署的监狱，关起来，要知事办他的罪。现在监狱里关人和从前两样，从前是绅士送农民来关，现在是农民送绅士来关。
    驱逐。这是土豪劣绅之罪恶昭著的。农民不是要驱逐，而是要捉他们，或杀他们。他们怕捉怕杀，逃跑出外。重要的土豪劣绅，在农民运动发达县份，几乎都跑光了，结果等于被驱逐。他们中间，头等跑到上海，次等跑到汉口，三等跑到长沙，四等跑到县城。这些逃跑的土豪劣绅，以逃到上海的为最安全。逃到汉口的，如华容的三个劣绅，终被捉回。逃到长沙的，更随时有被各县旅省学生捕获之虞，我在长沙就亲眼看见捕获两个。逃到县城的，资格已是第四等了，农民耳目甚多，发觉更易。湖南政府财政困难，财政当局曾归咎于农民驱逐阔人，以致筹款不易，亦可见土豪劣绅不容于乡里之一斑。
    枪毙。这必是很大的土豪劣绅，农民和各界民众共同做的。例如宁乡的杨致泽，岳阳的周嘉淦，华容的傅道南、孙伯助，是农民和各界人民督促政府枪毙的。湘潭的晏容秋，则是农民和各界人民强迫县长同意从监狱取出，由农民自己动手枪毙的。宁乡的刘昭，是农民直接打死的。醴陵的彭志蕃，益阳的周天爵、曹云，则正待“审判土豪劣绅特别法庭”判罪处决。这样的大劣绅、大土豪，枪毙一个，全县震动，于肃清封建余孽，极有效力。这样的大土豪劣绅，各县多的有几十个，少的也有几个，每县至少要把几个罪大恶极的处决了，才是镇压反动派的有效方法。土豪劣绅势盛时，杀农民真是杀人不眨眼。长沙新康镇团防局长何迈泉，办团十年，在他手里杀死的贫苦农民将近一千人，美其名曰“杀匪”。我的家乡湘潭县银田镇团防局长汤峻岩、罗叔林二人，民国二年以来十四年间，杀人五十多人，活埋四人。被杀的五十多人中，最先被杀的两人是完全无罪的乞丐。汤峻岩说：“杀两个叫化子开张！”这两个叫化子就是这样一命呜呼了。以前土豪劣绅的残忍，土豪劣绅造成的农村白色恐怖是这样，现在农民起来枪毙几个土豪劣绅，造成一点小小的镇压反革命派的恐怖现象，有什么理由说不应该？
            第三件  经济上打击地主
    不准谷米出境，不准高抬谷价，不准囤积居奇。这是近月湖南农民经济斗争上一件大事。从去年十月至现在，贫农把地主富农的谷米阻止出境，并禁止高抬谷价和囤积居奇。结果，贫农的目的完全达到，谷米阻得水泄不通，谷价大减，囤积居奇的绝迹。
    不准加租加押，宣传减租减押。去年七八月间，农会还在势力弱小时期，地主依然按照剥削从重老例，纷纷通知佃农定要加租加押。但是到了十月，农会势力大增，一致反对加租加押，地主便不敢再提加租加押四字。及至十一月后，农民势力压倒地主势力，农民乃进一步宣传减租减押。农民说：可惜去秋交租时农会尚无力量，不然去秋就减了租了。对于今秋减租，农民正大做宣传，地主们亦在问减租办法。至于减押，衡山等县目下已在进行。
    不准退佃。去年七八月间，地主还有好多退佃另佃的事。十月以后，无人敢退佃了。现在退佃另佃已完全不消说起，只有退佃自耕略有点问题。有些地方，地主退佃自耕，农民也不准。有些地方，地主如因自耕，可以允许退佃，但同时发生了佃农失业问题。此问题尚无一致的解决办法。
    减息。安化已普遍地减了息，他县亦有减息的事。惟农会势盛地方，地主惧怕“共产”，完全“卡借”，农村几无放债的事。此时所谓减息，限于旧债。旧债不仅减息，连老本也不许债主有逼取之事。贫农说：“怪不得，年岁大了，明年再还吧！”
        第四件  推翻土豪劣绅的封建统治——打倒都团〔一四〕
    旧式的都团（即区乡）政权机关，尤其是都之一级，即接近县之一级，几乎完全是土豪劣绅占领。“都”管辖的人口有一万至五六万之多，有独立的武装如团防局，有独立的财政征收权如亩捐等，有独立的司法权如随意对农民施行逮捕、监禁、审问、处罚。这样的机关里的劣绅，简直是乡里王。农民对政府如总统、督军〔一五〕、县长等还比较不留心，这班乡里王才真正是他们的“长上”，他们鼻子里哼一声，农民晓得这是要十分注意的。这回农村造反的结果，地主阶级的威风普遍地打下来，土豪劣绅把持的乡政机关，自然跟了倒塌。都总团总躲起不敢出面，一切地方上的事都推到农民协会去办。他们应付的话是：
    “不探（管）闲事！”
    农民们相与议论，谈到都团总，则愤然说：
    “那班东西么，不作用了！”
    “不作用”三个字，的确描画了经过革命风潮地方的旧式乡政机关。
            第五件  推翻地主武装，建立农民武装
    湖南地主阶级的武装，中路较少，西南两路较多，平均每县以六百枝步枪计，七十五县共有步枪四万五千枝，事实上或者还要多。农运发展区域之中南两路，因农民起来形势甚猛，地主阶级招架不住，其武装势力大部分投降农会，站在农民利益这边，例如宁乡、平江、浏阳、长沙、醴陵、湘潭、湘乡、安化、衡山、衡阳等县。小部分站在中立地位，但倾向于投降，例如宝庆等县。再一小部分则站在和农会敌对地位，例如宜章、临武、嘉禾等县，但现时农民正在加以打击，可能于不久时间消灭其势力。这样由反动的地主手里拿过来的武装，将一律改为“挨户团常备队”〔一六〕，而在新的乡村自治机关——农民政权的乡村自治机关管理之下。这种旧武装拿过来，是建设农民武装的一方面。建设农民武装另有一个新的方面，即农会的梭镖队。梭镖——一种接以长柄的单尖两刃刀，单湘乡一县有十万枝。其他各县，如湘潭、衡山、醴陵、长沙等，七八万枝、五六万枝、三四万枝不等。凡有农运各县，梭镖队便迅速地发展。这种有梭镖的农民，将成为“挨户团非常备队”。这个广大的梭镖势力，大于前述旧武装势力，是使一切土豪劣绅看了打颤的一种新起的武装力量。湖南的革命当局，应使这种武装力量确实普及于七十五县二千余万农民之中，应使每个青年壮年农民都有一柄梭镖，而不应限制它，以为这是可以使人害怕的东西。若被这种梭镖队吓翻了，那真是胆小鬼！只有土豪劣绅看了害怕，革命党决不应该看了害怕。
            第六件  推翻县官老爷衙门差役的政权
    县政治必须农民起来才能澄清，广东的海丰已经有了证明。这回在湖南，尤其得到了充分的证明。在土豪劣绅霸占权力的县，无论什么人去做知事，几乎都是贪官污吏。在农民已经起来的县，无论什么人去，都是廉洁政府。我走过的几县，知事遇事要先问农民协会。在农民势力极盛的县，农民协会说话是“飞灵的”。农民协会要早晨捉土豪劣绅，知事不敢捱到中午，要中午捉，不敢捱到下午。农民的权力在乡间初涨起来的时候，县知事和土豪劣绅是勾结一起共同对付农民的。在农民的权力涨至和地主权力平行的时候，县知事取了向地主农民两边敷衍的态度，农民协会的话，有一些被他接受，有一些被他拒绝。上头所说农会说话飞灵，是在地主权力被农民权力完全打下去了的时候。现在像湘乡、湘潭、醴陵、衡山等县的县政治状况是：
    （一）凡事取决于县长和革命民众团体的联合会议。这种会议，由县长召集，在县署开。有些县名之曰“公法团联席会议”，有些县名之曰“县务会议”。列席的人，县长以外，为县农民协会、县总工会、县商民协会、县女界联合会、县教职员联合会、县学生联合会以及国民党县党部〔一七〕的代表们。在这样的会议里，各民众团体的意见影响县长，县长总是唯命是听。所以，在湖南采用民主的委员制县政治组织，应当是没有问题的了。现在的县政府，形式和实质，都已经是颇民主的了。达到这种形势，是最近两三个月的事，即农民从四乡起来打倒了土豪劣绅权力以后的事。知事看见旧靠山已倒，要做官除非另找靠山，这才开始巴结民众团体，变成了上述的局面。
    （二）承审员没有案子。湖南的司法制度，还是知事兼理司法，承审员助知事审案。知事及其僚佐要发财，全靠经手钱粮捐派，办兵差和在民刑诉讼上颠倒敲诈这几件事。尤以后一件为经常可靠的财源。几个月来，土豪劣绅倒了，没有了讼棍。农民的大小事，又一概在各级农会里处理。所以，县公署的承审员，简直没有事做。湘乡的承审员告诉我：“没有农民协会以前，县公署平均每日可收六十件民刑讼诉禀帖；有农会后，平均每日只有四五件了。”于是知事及其僚佐们的荷包，只好空着。
    （三）警备队、警察、差役，一概敛迹。不敢下乡敲诈。从前乡里人怕城里人，现在城里人怕乡里人，尤其是县政府豢养的警察、警备队、差役这班恶狗。他们怕下乡，下乡也不敢再敲诈。他们看见农民的梭镖就发抖。
            第七件  推翻祠堂族长的族权和城隍土地菩萨的神权以至丈夫的
        男权
    中国的男子，普通要受三种有系统的权力的支配，即：（一）由一国、一省、一县以至一乡的国家系统（政权）；（二）由宗祠、支祠以至家长的家族系统（族权）；（三）由阎罗天子、城隍庙王以至土地菩萨的阴间系统以及由玉皇上帝以至各种神怪的神仙系统——总称之为鬼神系统（神权）。至于女子，除受上述三种权力的支配以外，还受男子的支配（夫权）。这四种权力——政权、族权、神权、夫权，代表了全部封建宗法的思想和制度，是束缚中国人民特别是农民的四条极大的绳索。农民在乡下怎样推翻地主的政权，已如前头所述。地主政权，是一切权力的基干。地主政权既被打翻，族权、神权、夫权便一概跟着动摇起来。农会势盛地方，族长及祠款经管人不敢再压迫族下子孙，不敢再侵蚀祠款。坏的族长、经管，已被当作土豪劣绅打掉了。从前祠堂里“打屁股”、“沉潭”、“活埋”等残酷的肉刑和死刑，再也不敢拿出来了。女子和穷人不能进祠堂吃酒的老例，也被打破。衡山白果地方的女子们，结队拥入祠堂，一屁股坐下便吃酒，族尊老爷们只好听她们的便。又有一处地方，因禁止贫农进祠堂吃酒，一批贫农拥进去，大喝大嚼，土豪劣绅长褂先生吓得都跑了。神权的动摇，也是跟着农民运动的发展而普遍。许多地方，农民协会占了神的庙宇做会所。一切地方的农民协会，都主张提取庙产办农民学校，做农会经费，名之曰“迷信公款”。醴陵禁迷信、打菩萨之风颇盛行。北乡各区农民禁止家神老爷（傩神）游香。渌口伏波岭庙内许多菩萨，因为办国民党区党部房屋不够，把大小菩萨堆于一角，农民无异言。自此以后，人家死了人，敬神、做道场、送大王灯的，就很少了。这事，因为是农会委员长孙小山倡首，当地的道士们颇恨孙小山。北三区龙凤庵农民和小学教员，砍了木菩萨煮肉吃。南区东富寺三十几个菩萨都给学生和农民共同烧掉了，只有两个小菩萨名“包公老爷”者，被一个老年农民抢去了，他说：“莫造孽！”在农民势力占了统治地位的地方，信神的只有老年农民和妇女，青年和壮年农民都不信了。农民协会是青年和壮年农民当权，所以对于推翻神权，破除迷信，是各处都在进行中的。夫权这种东西，自来在贫农中就比较地弱一点，因为经济上贫农妇女不能不较富有阶级的女子多参加劳动，所以她们取得对于家事的发言权以至决定权的是比较多些。至近年，农村经济益发破产，男子控制女子的基本条件，业已破坏了。最近农民运动一起，许多地方，妇女跟着组织了乡村女界联合会，妇女抬头的机会已到，夫权便一天一天地动摇起来。总而言之，所有一切封建的宗法的思想和制度，都随着农民权力的升涨而动摇。但是现在时期，农民的精力集中于破坏地主的政治权力这一点。要是地主的政治权力破坏完了的地方，农民对家族神道男女关系这三点便开始进攻了；但是这种进攻，现在到底还在“开始”，要完全推翻这三项，还要待农民的经济斗争全部胜利之后。因此，目前我们对农民应该领导他们极力做政治斗争，期于彻底推翻地主权力。并随即开始经济斗争，期于根本解决贫农的土地及其他经济问题。至于家族主义、迷信观念和不正确的男女关系之破坏，乃是政治斗争和经济斗争胜利以后自然而然的结果。若用过大的力量生硬地勉强地从事这些东西的破坏，那就必被土豪劣绅借为口实，提出“农民协会不孝祖宗”、“农民协会欺神灭道”、“农民协会主张共妻”等反革命宣传口号，来破坏农民运动。湖南的湘乡、湖北的阳新，最近都发生地主利用了农民反对打菩萨的事，就是明证。菩萨是农民立起来的，到了一定时期农民会用他们自己的双手丢开这些菩萨，无须旁人过早地代庖丢菩萨。共产党对于这些东西的宣传政策当是：“引而不发，跃如也。”〔一八〕菩萨要农民自己去丢，烈女祠、节孝坊要农民自己去摧毁，别人代庖是不对的。
    我在乡里也曾向农民宣传破除迷信。我的话是：
    “信八字望走好运，信风水望坟山贯气。今年几个月光景，土豪劣绅贪官污吏一齐倒台了。难道这几个月以前土豪劣绅贪官污吏还大家走好运，大家坟山都贯气，这几个月忽然大家走坏运，坟山也一齐不贯气了么？土豪劣绅形容你们农会的话是：‘巧得很啰，如今是委员世界呀，你看，屙尿都碰了委员。’的确不错，城里、乡里、工会、农会、国民党、共产党无一不有执行委员，确实是委员世界。但这也是八字坟山出的么？巧得很！乡下穷光蛋八字忽然都好了！坟山也忽然都贯气了！神明么？那是很可敬的。但是不要农民会，只要关圣帝君、观音大士，能够打倒土豪劣绅么？那些帝君、大士们也可怜，敬了几百年，一个土豪劣绅不曾替你们打倒！现在你们想减租，我请问你们有什么法子，信神呀，还是信农民会？”
    我这些话，说得农民都笑起来。
            第八件  普及政治宣传
    开一万个法政学校，能不能在这样短时间内普及政治教育于穷乡僻壤的男女老少，像现在农会所做的政治教育一样呢？我想不能吧。打倒帝国主义，打倒军阀，打倒贪官污吏，打倒土豪劣绅，这几个政治口号，真是不翼而飞，飞到无数乡村的青年壮年老头子小孩子妇女们的面前，一直钻进他们的脑子里去，又从他们的脑子里流到了他们的嘴上。比如有一群小孩子在那里玩吧，如果你看见一个小孩子对着另一个小孩子鼓眼蹬脚扬手动气时，你就立刻可以听到一种尖锐的声音，那便是：“打倒帝国主义！”
    湘潭一带的小孩子看牛时打起架来，一个做唐生智，一个做叶开鑫〔一九〕，一会儿一个打败了，一个跟着追，那追的就是唐生智，被追的就是叶开鑫。“打倒列强……”这个歌，固然街上的小孩子几乎人人晓得唱了，就是乡下的小孩子也有很多晓得唱了的。
    孙中山先生的那篇遗嘱，乡下农民也有些晓得念了。他们从那篇遗嘱里取出了“自由”、“平等”、“三民主义”、“不平等条约”这些名词，颇生硬地应用在他们的生活上。一个绅士模样的人在路上碰了一个农民，那绅士摆格不肯让路，那农民便愤然说：“土豪劣绅！晓得三民主义么？”长沙近郊菜园农民进城卖菜，老被警察欺负。现在，农民可找到武器了，这武器就是三民主义。当警察打骂卖菜农民时，农民便立即抬出三民主义以相抵制，警察没有话说。湘潭一个区的农民协会，为了一件事和一个乡农民协会不和，那乡农民协会的委员长便宣言：“反对区农民协会的不平等条约！”
    政治宣传的普及乡村，全是共产党和农民协会的功绩。很简单的一些标语、图画和讲演，使得农民如同每个都进过一下子政治学校一样，收效非常之广而速。据农村工作同志的报告，政治宣传在反英示威、十月革命纪念和北伐胜利总庆祝这三次大的群众集会时做得很普遍。在这些集会里，有农会的地方普遍地举行了政治宣传，引动了整个农村，效力很大。今后值得注意的，就是要利用各种机会，把上述那些简单的口号，使它们的内容渐渐充实，意义渐渐明了起来。
            第九件  农民诸禁
    共产党领导农会在乡下树立了威权，农民便把他们所不喜欢的事禁止或限制起来。最禁得严的便是牌、赌、鸦片这三件。
    牌：农会势盛地方，麻雀、骨牌、纸叶子，一概禁绝。
    湘乡十四都地方一个区农会，曾烧了一担麻雀牌。
    跑到乡间去，什么牌都没有打，犯禁的即刻处罚，一点客气也没有。
    赌：从前的“赌痞”现在自己在那里禁赌了，农会势盛地方，和牌一样弊绝风清。
    鸦片：非常之禁得严。农会下命令缴烟枪，不敢稍违抗不缴。醴陵一个劣绅不缴烟枪，被捉去游乡。
    农民这个“缴枪运动”，其声势不弱于北伐军对吴佩孚、孙传芳〔二○〕军队的缴枪。好些革命军军官家里的年尊老太爷，烟瘾极重，靠一杆“枪”救命的，都被“万岁”（劣绅讥诮农民之称）们缴了去。“万岁”们不仅禁种禁吃，还要禁运。由贵州经宝庆、湘乡、攸县、醴陵到江西去的鸦片，被拦截焚烧不少。这一来，和政府的财政发生了冲突。结果，还是省农会为了顾全北伐军饷，命令下级农会：“暂缓禁运”。但农民在那里愤愤不乐。
    三者以外，农民禁止或限制的东西还有很多，略举之则有：
    花鼓。一种小戏，许多地方禁止演唱。
    轿子。许多县有打轿子的事，湘乡特甚。农民最恨那些坐轿子的，总想打，但农会禁止他们。办农会的人对农民说：“你们打轿子，反倒替阔人省了钱，轿工要失业，岂非害了自己？”农民们想清了，出了新法子，就是大涨轿工价，以此惩富人。
    煮酒熬糖。普遍禁止用谷米煮酒熬糖，糟行糖行叫苦不迭。衡山福田铺地方，不禁止煮酒，但限定酒价于一极小数目，酒店无钱赚，只好不煮了。
    猪。限制每家喂猪的数目，因为猪吃去谷米。
    鸡鸭。湘乡禁喂鸡鸭，但妇女们反对。衡山洋塘地方限制每家只准喂三个，福田铺地方只准喂五个。好些地方完全禁止喂鸭，因为鸭比鸡更无用，它不仅吃掉谷，而且搓死禾。
    酒席。丰盛酒席普遍地被禁止。湘潭韶山地方议决客来吃三牲，即只吃鸡鱼猪。笋子、海带、南粉都禁止吃。衡山则议决吃八碗，不准多一碗。醴陵东三区只准吃五碗，北二区只准吃三荤三素，西三区禁止请春客。湘乡禁止“蛋糕席”——一种并不丰盛的席面。湘乡二都有一家讨媳妇，用了蛋糕席，农民以他不服从禁令，一群人涌进去，搅得稀烂。湘乡的嘉谟镇实行不吃好饮食，用果品祭祖。
    牛。这是农民的宝贝。“杀牛的来生变牛”，简直成了宗教，故牛是杀不得的。农民没有权力时，只能用宗教观念反对杀牛，没有实力去禁止。农会起来后，权力管到牛身上去了，禁止城里杀牛。湘潭城内从前有六家牛肉店，现在倒了五家，剩下一家是杀病牛和废牛的。衡山全县禁绝了杀牛。一个农民他有一头牛跌脱了脚，问过农会，才敢杀。株州商会冒失地杀了一头牛，农民上街问罪，罚钱而外，放爆竹赔礼。
    游民生活。如打春、赞土地、打莲花落，醴陵议决禁止。各县有禁止的，有自然消灭没人干这些事的。有一种“强告化”又叫“流民”者，平素非常之凶，现在亦只得屈服于农会之下。湘潭韶山地方有个雨神庙，素聚流民，谁也不怕，农会起来，悄悄地走了。同地湖堤乡农会，捉了三个流民挑土烧窑。拜年陋俗，议决禁止。
    此外各地的小禁令还很多，如醴陵禁傩神游香，禁买南货斋果送情，禁中元烧衣包，禁新春贴瑞签。湘乡的谷水地方水烟也禁了。二都禁放鞭炮和三眼铳，放鞭炮的罚洋一元二角，放铳的罚洋二元四角。七都和二十都禁做道场。十八都禁送奠仪。诸如此类，不胜枚举，统名之曰农民诸禁。
    这些禁令中，包含两个重要意义：第一是对于社会恶习之反抗，如禁牌赌鸦片等，这些东西是跟了地主阶级恶劣政治环境来的，地主权力既倒，这些东西也跟着扫光。第二是对于城市商人剥削之自卫，如禁吃酒席，禁买南货斋果送情等等。因为工业品特贵，农产品特贱，农民极为贫困，受商人剥削厉害，不得不提倡节俭，借以自卫。至于前述之农民阻谷出境，是因为贫农自己粮食不够吃，还要向市上买，所以不许粮价高涨。这都是农民贫困和城乡矛盾的缘故，并非农民拒绝工业品和城乡贸易，实行所谓东方文化主义〔二一〕。农民为了经济自卫，必须组织合作社，实行共同买货和消费。还须政府予以援助，使农民协会能组织信用（放款）合作社。如此，农民自然不必以阻谷为限制食粮价格的方法，也不会以拒绝某些工业品入乡为经济自卫的方法了。
            第十件  清匪
    从禹汤文武起吧，一直清朝皇帝、民国总统，我想没有那一个朝代的统治者有现在农民协会这样肃清盗匪的威力。什么盗匪，在农会势盛地方，连影子都不见了。巧得很，许多地方，连偷小菜的小偷都没有了。有些地方，还有小偷。至于土匪，则我所走过的各县全然绝了迹，那怕从前是出土匪很多的地方。原因：一是农会会员漫山遍野，梭镖短棍一呼百应，土匪无处藏踪。二是农民运动起后，谷子价廉，去春每担六元的，去冬只二元，民食问题不如从前那样严重。三是会党加入了农会，在农会里公开地合法地逞英雄，吐怨气，“山、堂、香、水”〔二二〕的秘密组织，没有存在的必要了。杀猪宰羊，重捐重罚，对压迫他们的土豪劣绅阶级出气也出够了。四是各军大招兵，“不逞之徒”去了许多。因此，农运一起，匪患告绝。对于这一点，绅富方面也同情于农会。他们的议论是：“农民协会么？讲良心话，也有一点点好处。”
    对于禁牌赌、鸦片和清匪，农民协会是博得一般人的同情的。
            第十一件  废苛捐
    全国未统一，帝国主义军阀势力未推翻，农民对政府税捐的繁重负担，质言之，即革命军的军费负担，还是没有法子解除的。但是土豪劣绅把持乡政时加于农民的苛捐如亩捐〔二三〕等，却因农民运动的兴起，土豪绅劣的倒塌而取消，至少也减轻了，这也要算是农民协会的功绩之一。
            第十二件  文化运动
    中国历来只是地主有文化，农民没有文化。可是地主的文化是由农民造成的，因为造成地主文化的东西，不是别的，正是从农民身上掠取的血汗。中国有百分之九十未受文化教育的人民，这个里面，最大多数是农民。农村里地主势力一倒，农民的文化运动便开始了。试看农民一向痛恶学校，如今却在努力办夜学。“洋学堂”，农民是一向看不惯的。我从前做学生时，回乡看见农民反对“洋学堂”，也和一般“洋学生”、“洋教习”一鼻孔出气，站在洋学堂的利益上面，总觉得农民未免有些不对。民国十四年在乡下住了半年，这时我是一个共产党员，有了马克思主义的观点，方才明白我是错了，农民的道理是对的。乡村小学校的教材，完全说些城里的东西，不合农村的需要。小学教师对待农民的态度又非常之不好，不但不是农民的帮助者，反而变成了农民所讨厌的人。故农民宁欢迎私塾（他们叫“汉学”），不欢迎学校（他们叫“洋学”），宁欢迎私塾老师，不欢迎小学教员。如今他们却大办其夜学，名之曰农民学校。有些已经举办，有些正在筹备，平均每乡有一所。他们非常热心开办这种学校，认为这样的学校才是他们自己的。夜学经费，提取迷信公款、祠堂公款及其他闲公闲产。这些公款，县教育局要提了办国民学校即是那不合农民需要的“洋学堂”，农民要提了办农民学校，争议结果，各得若干，有些地方是农民全得了。农民运动发展的结果，农民的文化程度迅速地提高了。不久的时间内，全省当有几万所学校在乡村中涌出来，不若知识阶级和所谓“教育家”者流，空唤“普及教育”，唤来唤去还是一句废话。
            第十三件  合作社运动
    合作社，特别是消费、贩卖、信用三种合作社，确是农民所需要的。他们买进货物要受商人的剥削，卖出农产要受商人的勒抑，钱米借贷要受重利盘剥者的剥削，他们很迫切地要解决这三个问题。去冬长江打仗，商旅路断，湖南盐贵，农民曾为盐的需要组织合作社的很多。地主“卡借”，农民因借钱而企图组织“借贷所”的，亦所在多有。大问题，就是详细的正规的组织法没有。各地农民自动组织的，往往不合合作社的原则，因此做农运的同志，总是殷勤地问“章程”。假如有适当的指导，合作运动可以随农会的发展而发展到各地。
        第十四件  修道路、修塘坝
    这也是农会的一件功绩。没有农会以前，乡村的道路非常之坏。无钱不能修路，有钱的人不肯拿出来，只好让它坏。略有修理，也当作慈善事业，从那些“肯积阴功”的人家化募几个，修出些又狭又薄的路。农会起来了，把命令发出去，三尺、五尺、七尺、一丈，按照路径所宜，分等定出宽狭，勒令沿路地主，各修一段。号令一出，谁敢不依？不久时间，许多好走的路都出来了。这却并非慈善事业，乃是出于强迫，但是这一点子强迫实在强迫得还可以。塘坝也是一样，无情的地主总是要从佃农身上取得东西，却不肯花几个大钱修理塘坝，让它干旱，饿死佃农，他们却只知收租。有了农会，可以不客气地发命令强迫地主修塘坝了。地主不修时，农会却很和气地对地主说道：“好！你们不修，你们出谷吧，斗谷一工！”地主为斗谷一工划不来，赶快自己修。因此，许多不好的塘坝变成了好塘坝。
    总上十四件事，都是农民在农会指挥之下做出来的。就其基本的精神说来，就其革命意义说来，请读者们想一想，那一件不好？说这些事不好的，我想，只有土豪劣绅们吧！很奇怪，南昌方面〔二四〕传来消息，说蒋介石、张静江〔二五〕诸位先生的意见，颇不以湖南农民的举动为然。湖南的右派领袖刘岳峙〔二六〕辈，与蒋、张诸公一个意见，都说：“这简直是赤化了！”我想，这一点子赤化若没有时，还成个什么国民革命？嘴里天天说“唤起民众”，民众起来了又害怕得要死，这和叶公好龙〔二七〕有什么两样？
    （一）湖南是当时全国农民运动的中心。
    （二）赵恒惕是当时北洋军阀统治湖南的代理人。一九二六年北伐军推翻了他的统治。
    （三）辛亥革命即一九一一年推翻满清专制朝廷的革命。该年十月十日，一部分新军在当时资产阶级和小资产阶级的革命团体的策动下，起义于武昌，其后各省亦相继起义，满清的统治很快即土崩瓦解。一九一二年一月一日南京成立中华民国临时政府，选举孙中山为临时大总统。这次革命是经过资产阶级和农民、工人及城市小资产阶级的同盟而取得胜利的。但这次革命又由于革命领导集团的妥协性，没有给农民以真正的利益，并接受帝国主义和封建势力的压力，因而使政权落入北洋军阀袁世凯之手，革命遂告失败。
    （四）“矫枉过正”是一句成语，原意是纠正错误而超过了应有的限度。但旧时有人常用这句话去拘束人们的活动，即只能够在修正旧成规的范围内活动，而不许完全破坏旧成规。在修正旧成规的范围内活动，叫做合乎“正”，如果完全破坏旧成规，就叫做“过正”。这也正是改良派和革命队伍内机会主义者的理论。毛泽东同志在这里驳斥了这类改良派的理论。所谓“矫枉必须过正，不过正不能矫枉”，就是说，要终结旧的封建秩序，必须用群众的革命方法，而不是用修正的——改良的方法。
    （五）一九二六年冬季及一九二七年春季北伐军进到长江流域的时候，蒋介石的反革命面目还没有充分地暴露出来，农民群众还认为他是革命的。地主富农则不高兴他，造出了北伐军打败仗及蒋介石伤脚的谣言。蒋介石反革命面目的充分暴露，是在一九二七年四月十二日他在上海等地举行反革命政变，实行屠杀工人、镇压农民和打击共产党以后。从这时起，地主富农就对他改取拥护态度了。
    （六）广东是第一次国内革命战争时期的最早的革命根据地。
    （七）吴佩孚为北洋军阀著名的代表之一，与一九二三年著名的贿选总统曹锟同属于北洋军阀中的直系（即直隶省派系），并奉曹锟为首领，世合称“曹吴”。吴佩孚从一九二○年战败皖系军阀段祺瑞后，即左右北洋军阀政府的政局，为英美帝国主义的代理人，曾在一九二三年二月七日大杀京汉铁路的罢工工人。一九二四年在与张作霖的战争（一般人叫做“直奉战争”）中失败，吴佩孚乃失却北京政权。但一九二六年，经过日英帝国主义的策动，他又和张作霖联合，因而再起。一九二六年北伐军从广东出发，首先直接打倒的敌人即吴佩孚。
    （八）三民主义即孙中山对于中国资产阶级革命所提出的民族、民权、民生三个原则。一九二四年孙中山在“国民党第一次代表大会宣言”中，重新解释三民主义，把民族主义解释为反对帝国主义，并表示积极拥护工农运动，旧三民主义因此发展为联俄、联共、扶助农工的三大政策的新三民主义。这三大政策的新三民主义成为第一次国内革命战争时期中共产党与国民党合作的政治基础。请参看“新民主主义论”第十节。
    （九）不应当容许富农加入农会。一九二七年时期，农民群众还不知道这一点。
    （一○）毛泽东同志在这里所指的“赤贫”，是包括雇农（乡村无产者）和乡村游民无产者而言。
    （一一）指乡村半无产阶级。
    （一二）指当时的国民党县党部。
    （一三）袁祖铭是当时盘据湘西的一个贵州军阀。
    （一四）湖南的都和团相当于区和乡。旧式都团的乡政机关是地主统治农民的工具。都、团的负责人称“都总”、“团总”。
    （一五）督军是北洋军阀的统治在各省省级所设置的军事首脑的称号。“督军”实际上总揽全省军事政治大权，为一省范围内的独裁者，他们和帝国主义者相勾结，实行地方性的封建军事割据。
    （一六）挨户团常备队，是当时农村武装组织的一种。“挨户”是形容几乎每一户人家都要参加的意思。在一九二七年革命失败后，许多地方的“挨户团”被地主所夺取，变成了反革命的武装组织。
    （一七）当时在武汉国民党中央领导下的各地国民党县党部，很多是属于执行孙中山联俄、联共、扶助农工三大政策的组织，是共产党人、左派国民党员和其他革命分子的革命联盟。
    （一八）这句话是从“孟子”上引来的，大意是说善于教人射箭的人，引满了弓，不射出去，却摆着跃跃欲动的姿势。在这里是借来比喻共产党引导农民得到了充分的反迷信的觉悟，然后便等待农民自愿地自动地去破除迷信，却不自己发号施令，代替农民去破除迷信。
    （一九）唐生智，是当时站在革命方面参加北伐战争的一个将军。叶开鑫，是当时站在北洋军阀方面反对革命的一个将军。
    （二○）孙传芳，当时统治江南五省的军阀，镇压上海工人起义的刽子手。他的军队主力于一九二六年冬天在江西的南昌、九江为北伐军所打垮。
    （二一）东方文化主义，是以保存东方落后的农业生产和封建文化为满足、而排斥近代科学文明的一种反动思想。
    （二二）山、堂、香、水，是原始秘密结社的一些宗派的称号。
    （二三）指当时豪绅政权除抽收原有田赋外另行苛剥农民的田亩捐。
    （二四）北伐军于一九二六年十一月间占领南昌，蒋介石利用机会把他的总司令部设在这个地方，集合了国民党右派和一部分北洋军阀的政客，勾结帝国主义，布置反革命的阴谋，以对抗当时革命的武汉，最后发动了叛变革命的一九二七年四月十二日的大屠杀的政变。
    （二五）张静江是当时国民党右派的头子之一，为蒋介石设谋画策的人。
    （二六）刘岳峙是湖南当时一个重要的反共团体的头子。
    （二七）叶公好龙，是汉朝刘向所作“新序”一书中讲的一个故事：“叶公子高好龙，钩以写龙，凿以写龙，屋室雕文以写龙。于是天龙闻而下之，窥头于牖。施尾于堂。叶公见之，弃而还走，失其魂魄，五色无主。是叶公非好龙也，好夫似龙而非龙者也。”此处毛泽东同志用以比喻蒋介石辈的口谈革命，实际则畏惧革命，反对革命。
