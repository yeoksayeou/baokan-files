    (X) Song Xiankui and four others nervously secured each bomb. More than thirty workers hauled them back and forth in five trips. No one was intimidated by the danger. The timed bombs, like prisoners, were hauled away by fearless workers; some exploded with a "boom" as soon as they were pulled onto the riverbank.
    (XI) After dinner, leading comrades announced the engineering plan, calling on everyone to repair the bridge within five days to ensure transportation to the front lines. Song Xiankui and the bridge-repairing heroes discussed it, and everyone's opinion was: "Let's organize our manpower well and strive to open the bridge to traffic within three days!"
    (XII) As soon as it got dark, the repair heroes began to act. Those carrying sleepers, building wooden piles, and lifting steel beams challenged each other, ensuring speed and stability. Everyone had only one will: to quickly repair the bridge, support the front lines, and defeat the American aggressors.

    特等功臣宋显魁
    英韬画
    （十）宋显魁等五个人，紧张地拴牢了每个炸弹。三十多个工人来回拉了五趟。谁也没有被危险吓住。定时炸弹在无畏的工人面前，像俘虏样的被拉走了；有的刚拉到河滩上，就“轰”的一声炸开了。
    （十一）晚饭后，领导同志宣布了工程计划，号召为保证前线运输，在五天内把桥修好。宋显魁和修桥英雄们合计了一下，大家的意见是：“咱们把人力组织好，争取在三天内通车！”
    （十二）天色一黑，抢修的英雄开始行动了。抗枕木的、打木垛的、起钢梁的互相挑了战，保证又快又稳。大家的意志只有一个：快修好桥梁，支援前线，打垮美国侵略者。
