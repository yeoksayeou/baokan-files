　　Success of Currency Unification
　　By our Special Correspondent Wang Qizhi
　　Following the order issued by the Government Administration Council and the Northeast People's Government on April 1st to implement currency unification, the work of recalling the Northeast local currency circulating in the Northeast region with RMB within a limited time has been successfully completed. After the implementation of currency unification, the market order is good, and prices are stable; the exchange of goods between inside and outside the Shanhaiguan is smoother; various production undertakings have developed significantly; monetary credit has been further consolidated; and the prestige of the People's Government has also been further enhanced. Workers said: With the currency unification, the scope of material exchange has expanded, production will definitely develop, and people's lives will inevitably improve gradually. We support currency unification and guarantee our efforts in production and work with action. Farmers said: The Northeast has many local products. Now that the banknotes inside and outside Shanhaiguan are the same, it will be easier to sell local products. The Chairman of the Shenyang Machine Parts Manufacturing Industry Association said: "Since the liberation of Shenyang, our industry has developed from the original 127 companies to 1,144 due to stable prices. However, because of the rapid development, there is currently a slight backlog of products, and we need to open up sales channels. The People's Government decided to unify the currency inside and outside Shanhaiguan at this time, which is convenient for a large number of products to enter the customs. The government's policy is really excellent." An old gentleman in Bei'an wrote to the bank saying: "China has never unified its currency since ancient times. Now, from Hainan Island to Heilongjiang, the same money is used. This can only be done in a new country. I have lived for more than sixty years and can see these things with my own eyes. I am getting happier and happier."
　　The success of currency unification is primarily due to the Central People's Government and the Northeast Administrative Region's careful consideration based on the development of financial and production conditions. When deciding on the exchange rate, prices, and exchange period, they adopted a responsible attitude, proceeded from the interests of the broad masses of the people, and took effective measures to avoid all possible deviations. Especially for several materials with large regional price differences due to the past currency disunity and different exchange rates, transitional control measures were taken to prevent excessive impact and affect the lives of people inside and outside Shanhaiguan, so that the prices in the Northeast and inside Shanhaiguan remained stable and unaffected by fluctuations, achieving the purpose of smooth flow of goods.
　　Secondly, the conscientious leadership and implementation of the decision by the Party organizations and governments at all levels in the Northeast provinces, cities, and counties, and the coordinated and consistent actions between various departments, are also important reasons for the success of currency unification.
　　First, to do a good job in currency unification, leading cadres of the Party and government at all levels in the Northeast provinces, cities, and counties conducted in-depth mobilization and deployment, designated special personnel to be responsible for monitoring the situation, and convened meetings of industrial and commercial representatives on the afternoon of the day before currency unification to convey the currency unification policy and specific measures. They enlightened them to implement patriotic covenants to ensure no speculation and no price increases. In addition, some also convened consultative committee meetings, people's representative meetings, or resident group leader meetings to mobilize people from all walks of life to guarantee the implementation of this decision; and mobilized all the people to be vigilant at all times, expose rumors, track down special agents, and report any behavior that undermines financial order to the government for legal punishment. These practices have played a very good role.
　　Second, the Northeast Trade Department is responsible for organizing the material preparation and dispatch work in large, medium, and small cities to ensure sufficient supply of materials and meet market needs. The Northeast Regional Bank prepared to sell a large amount of gold in various places to stabilize finance and consolidate monetary credit. At the beginning of the announcement of the currency unification order, some private merchants held a skeptical attitude, temporarily did not mark prices, or marked prices for cold goods but not for hot goods; in transactions, they showed a wait-and-see attitude and were not eager to make deals. Some wealthy people were also afraid that currency unification would cause them losses, afraid of exposing their wealth, and unwilling to exchange at the bank, so they purchased a large number of goods and gold at state-owned stores and gold shops. However, because the state-owned stores and gold shops had sufficient inventory of goods and gold, they quickly corrected these people's wrong ideas. The most obvious is that the price of gold fell from 1.47 million yuan per tael of RMB to 1.3 million yuan, and it was still falling. By the end of May, not many people were buying gold in large quantities, but many people were selling it to state gold shops.
　　Third, state-owned enterprises, tax authorities, public utilities, and cooperatives, without exception, implemented the government's policy of stabilizing prices and played a leading role. When new prices were marked, they were completely converted at the original price of 9.5 (9.5 yuan of Northeast local currency) to 1 (1 yuan of RMB); therefore, it influenced local private industrial and commercial enterprises, enabling them to implement the government's decision.
　　Fourth, after the announcement of currency unification, the propaganda department actively carried out propaganda and explanation work: compiled a propaganda manual on currency unification, explaining the currency unification policy and exchange procedures in a popular question-and-answer format, so that propagandists had a basis for explaining questions, which played a great role in consolidating currency credit and stabilizing market morale. The Northeast Daily and newspapers in various provinces and cities, in addition to publishing relevant news and commentaries in important sections, also exposed the phenomenon of individual bad elements deceiving farmers and peddlers, which aroused timely attention and prevented everyone from being deceived again. In addition, it introduced several times in the newspapers the simple algorithm for converting various numbers at a ratio of 9.5 to 1, solving the difficulties in calculation.
　　Fifth, local banks received strong support from governments at all levels in deploying the exchange work. For example, they temporarily transferred cadres to assist, found exchange office addresses, dispatched armed protection, and organized rural mobile exchange teams to go to the countryside for exchange, or entrusted rural cooperatives to exchange on their behalf, so that the exchange work was completed as scheduled.

　　币制统一的成功
    本报特约记者  王企之
    遵照政务院和东北人民政府四月一日的命令，实行币制统一。限期以人民币收回东北地区发行之东北地方流通券的工作，已经全部胜利结束了。币制统一实行之后，市场秩序良好，物价稳定；关内外物资交流更加畅通；各种生产事业显著发展；货币信用益加巩固；人民政府威信也更加提高。职工们说：币制统一了，物资交流范围扩大了，生产一定发展，人民生活必然随着逐步提高。我们拥护币制统一，同时并以行动保证努力生产，做好工作。农民们说：东北土产很多。关内外钞票一样了，土产就更好销了。沈阳机器零件制造业理事长说：“我们这一行业在沈阳解放以后，由于物价稳定，已经由原来的一百二十七家发展到一千一百四十四家。但因发展过于迅速，目前产品稍有积压，正需要打开销路，而人民政府恰在这时候决定关内外币制统一，便于产品大量进关，政府的政策真是再好也没有了。”北安一位老先生给银行来信说：“中国自古以来币制也没有统一过。现在从海南岛到黑龙江都用一样钱，这只有在新国家里才能办到。我活了六十多岁，能亲眼看到这些事情，真是越活越高兴。”
    币制统一的成功，首先是由于中央人民政府与东北大行政区能根据金融和生产条件的发展，慎重考虑；在决定比价、物价与兑换时期上，抱着认真负责的态度，从广大人民利益出发，采取有效步骤，避免了一切可能发生的偏向。尤其对过去因货币不统一、比值不同而地区差价较大的几种物资，为了防止冲击过大，影响关内外人民生活，采取了过渡性的管制办法，使东北与关内物价都保持平稳，不受波动，而达到物畅其流的目的。
    其次，东北各省、市、县党的组织和政府认真领导，贯彻决定；各部门之间协同动作，步调一致，也是统一币制成功的重要原因。
    第一、东北各省、市、县党政领导干部，为做好币制统一工作，曾进行了深入的动员、布置，指定专人负责掌握情况，并均于币制统一前一日下午召开工商业代表会议，传达币制统一政策与具体措施，启发他们实行爱国公约，保证不投机，不抬高物价。此外，也有的召开了协商委员会议，人民代表会议或居民组长会议，动员各阶层人民来保证贯彻这一决定；并动员全体人民随时警惕，揭穿谣言，追查特务，发现破坏金融行为要报告政府，依法予以处分。这些做法，都起了很好的作用。
    第二、东北贸易部负责组织大中小城市的物资准备与调度工作，保证物资充分供应，满足市场需要。东北区银行在各地准备抛售大量黄金，稳定金融，巩固货币信用。在开始公布币制统一命令时，有一部分私商曾抱怀疑态度，暂不标价，或冷货标价，热货不标价；交易上表现观望，不急于求成交。也有一部分有钱人怕币制统一使自己受到损失，怕暴露财富，不愿到银行兑换，而到国营商店、金店大量购买物品与黄金。但因国营商店和金店存货和存金十分充裕，很快就纠正了这些人的错误想法。最显明的是金价由每两人民币一百四十七万元跌到一百三十万元，还要下跌。至五月底，已经不是很多人大量购买黄金，而是很多人向国家金店出售了。
    第三、公营企业、税收机关、公用事业、合作社，无例外地贯彻执行政府稳定物价的政策，起带头作用，在新标价时完全以原价九·五（东北地方流通券九元五角）比一（人民币一元）折算；因此影响了各地私人工商业，使他们也都能执行政府的决定。
    第四、在宣布币制统一之后，宣传部门即积极进行宣传解释工作：编制了关于币制统一的宣传员手册，以通俗问答形式说明币制统一政策与兑换手续，使宣传员在解释疑问时有所根据，对巩固币制信用与安定市场人心起了很大作用。东北日报以及各省市报纸，除以重要篇幅刊载有关的新闻、评论之外，并揭露了个别坏分子欺骗农民、小贩的现象，及时引起注意，使大家免再受骗。此外，又几次在报纸上介绍了各种数目按九·五比一折算的简易算法，解决计算中的困难。
    第五、各地银行在布置兑换工作时，均得到各级政府大力支持。如临时抽调干部协助，代找兑换办公地址，加派武装保护，并组织农村流动兑换组下乡兑换，或通过农村合作社代为兑换，使兑换工作如期完成。
