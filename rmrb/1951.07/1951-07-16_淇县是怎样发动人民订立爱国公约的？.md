　　Editor's Note: One of the experiences of Qi County in mobilizing the people to establish patriotic pacts is to conduct a series of patriotic education activities for the masses by seizing various specific facts (including accusing the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang of crimes, distinguishing between the new and old social systems, comparing the lives of the front and the rear, etc.). It relies on the conscious demands of the masses to formulate patriotic pacts. Therefore, the formulated articles are simple, specific, and reflect the ideological emotions of the masses. However, according to the inspection of the Anyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, such better patriotic pacts are still a minority, and there is still a considerable serious tendency toward formalism in general. The way to overcome this tendency is, first of all, to conduct a serious inspection and strive to promote existing successful experiences.

　　Since this spring, Qi County, Pingyuan Province, has widely mobilized the people to establish patriotic pacts. In addition to county-wide patriotic pacts, most agencies, organizations, and schools have formulated patriotic pacts for their own units. In rural areas, 135 villages have established patriotic pacts, accounting for 89% of the total number of administrative villages in the county. Since the widespread launch of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, small units such as mutual aid groups, families, and shops in various villages and towns have formulated specific patriotic pacts. For example, in the second and third districts of the county, 68 out of 78 villages had militias establish patriotic pacts; in the second district, 203 mutual aid groups established patriotic pacts; in the urban industrial and commercial circles, 270 out of 330 households in six industries have established pacts; and in Dong Street, 200 out of 334 households have established family patriotic pacts. Through the establishment of patriotic pacts, the county successfully completed tasks such as cotton planting, summer harvest, summer planting, field protection, and pest control, and promoted the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement. The county's experience in promoting patriotic pacts mainly includes the following points:

  I. Based on the accusation movement, deepen patriotic education, so that the establishment of patriotic pacts
       becomes a conscious requirement of the masses

　　In the past few months, Qi County has mobilized the broad masses to participate in the accusation movement, making everyone realize that "U.S. imperialism is the root of counter-revolution"; then, it enlightened the masses to compare the "times" before and after liberation, and conducted education to distinguish between the new and old social systems. The masses said, "When we pick up our rice bowl, we think of our government!" Realizing that their good times are inseparable from the motherland. At the same time, the county universally conveyed the reports of the returning representatives of the Volunteers, and organized the masses to study the Korean communications "Who are the Most Beloved People?" and "Soldiers and the Motherland." It also mobilized the masses to compare the lives of the front and rear, and asked everyone to learn from the frontline soldiers. After that, the masses discussed and proposed their own patriotic action plans, and wanted to "say it on their lips and write it on paper," turning the establishment of patriotic pacts into a conscious requirement. After the pacts were established, they automatically posted them in the village offices, posted them at home, and sent them to the county to express their determination. Some carried them with them, for fear of forgetting.

  II. Cultivate a large number of key members to lead the masses

　　Through the anti-U.S. aggression and aid Korea representative meeting and other meetings, the county successively cultivated 1,500 key members, who used various occasions to publicize to the masses and took the lead in establishing patriotic pacts. Some villages established anti-U.S. aggression and aid Korea committees to unite the key members of their villages. The county party committee also organized cadres to conduct key inspections, and discovered typical units with better results in establishing and implementing patriotic pacts, and then summarized their experiences and gradually promoted them. In rural areas, the Communist Party branch and the Communist Youth League generally make plans to lead the masses to establish patriotic pacts, and then mobilize the masses to establish patriotic pacts separately.

  III. Closely integrate with the central work

　　The content of the patriotic pacts of each unit includes: (1) Specific content of a political nature, such as: responding to the government's call, doing whatever they are asked to do; reporting saboteurs, exposing rumors, and controlling counter-revolutionaries; increasing production, supporting the front line, taking the lead in handing over public grain, and achieving "clean, thorough, and full"; doing a good job in substitute farming. (2) Content combined with their own business: Farmers mostly ensure bumper harvests of cotton and grain, hand over public grain well, and do a good job in substitute farming. Businessmen mostly stabilize prices, make small profits and sell more, and pay taxes on time. People from other walks of life also have different contents, such as blacksmiths who have a clause: "Work hard to make agricultural tools and equipment to supply the masses; improve technology, do not be conservative, and study more with other blacksmiths." Shepherds have a clause: "Ensure that the sheep are grazed well, do not damage the lambs, and benefit both the country and the people." (3) Content on learning, such as "The whole family studies current affairs, and everyone acts as a propagandist." In addition, some are aimed at their own shortcomings and propose improvement methods: for example, if the family is not harmonious, a special clause is formulated: "The family is harmonious, and things are discussed democratically." Most family pacts have a clause on hygiene work, such as "To achieve clean houses, clean courtyards, clean pots, clean bowls, and clean clothes." All patriotic pacts that have been fully discussed by the masses, "everyone says, everyone makes, everyone acts," and are specific, simple, easy to remember, and easy to do, have played a great role.

　　Some units have also stipulated an inspection system within a certain period of time to ensure the full realization and sustainability of the pact. For example, in checking the patriotic pacts, businessmen in Chengguan found that the white flour shops adulterated the flour, violating the "genuine goods at fair prices" clause; the grocery stores raised market prices, violating the "stabilize prices" clause. The businessmen said, "Don't speculate and violate the pacts anymore." The inspection of the pacts has formed a mass self-education movement.

　　However, the units in the county that have established and implemented patriotic pacts well are still a minority; most of the patriotic pacts have not been fully discussed by the masses, and some places still have formalism tendencies such as cadres taking over and copying the clauses of other people's patriotic pacts. Therefore, it is still necessary to launch the masses to check the implementation of the patriotic pacts and supplement and revise the patriotic pacts through this patriotic donation movement.

　　淇县是怎样发动人民订立爱国公约的？
　　中共平原省安阳地方委员会
    编者按：淇县发动人民订立爱国公约的经验之一，是抓住各种具体事实向人民群众进行一系列的爱国主义教育（包括控诉美蒋匪帮罪行，区别新旧两种社会制度，对比前线和后方的生活等），依靠群众的自觉要求来制订爱国公约，因而所订条文通俗、具体，反映了群众的思想情绪。不过根据中共安阳地委的检查，这种较好的爱国公约还是少数的，一般还存在着相当严重的形式主义偏向。克服这种偏向的办法，首先就是通过认真的检查，努力推广已有的成功经验。
    今春以来，平原省淇县普遍发动人民订立了爱国公约。除全县性的爱国公约外，各机关、团体、学校大多订立了本单位的爱国公约；农村中订立爱国公约的已达一百三十五村，占全县行政村总数的百分之八十九。从镇压反革命运动广泛开展以后，各村镇的互助组、家庭、商店等小单位订立了具体的爱国公约。例如该县二、三区共有七十八个村，其中六十八个村的民兵订立了爱国公约；二区订立爱国公约的互助组有二百零三个；城关工商界六个行业三百三十户中，订公约者已有二百七十户；东街三百三十四户，订家庭爱国公约者达二百户。通过订立爱国公约，该县顺利完成了植棉、夏收、夏种、护场、治虫等工作，并推动了镇压反革命运动。该县推行爱国公约的经验，主要有下列几点：
  一、在控诉运动的基础上，深入爱国主义教育，使订立爱国公约
        成为群众自觉的要求
    淇县数月来发动广大群众参加了控诉运动，使大家认识到“美帝国主义是反革命的老根”；进而启发群众对比了解放前后的“时光”，进行了区别新旧社会制度的教育，群众说：“端起饭来，就想到咱的政府了！”认识到自己的好时光与祖国是不可分的。同时，该县普遍传达了志愿军归国代表的报告，又组织群众学习了朝鲜通讯《谁是最可爱的人？》和《战士与祖国》。又发动群众作前、后方的生活对比，要求大家向前方战士看齐。之后，群众就纷纷讨论，提出了自己的爱国行动计划，并要“说在嘴上，写在纸上”，把订立爱国公约变成了自觉的要求。公约订立后，他们自动地把它贴在村公所，贴在家里，送到县里，以表示决心，有的带在身边，惟恐忘记。
  二、培养大批骨干分子，带动群众
    经过抗美援朝代表会及其他各种会议，该县先后培养了骨干分子一千五百人，通过他们，利用各种场合，向群众宣传，并带头订立爱国公约。有些村成立了抗美援朝委员会，以团结本村的骨干分子。中共县委又组织干部进行了重点检查，发现订立与执行爱国公约成绩较好的典型单位，即总结其经验，逐步推广。农村中一般是先由中共支部、青年团作出领导群众订立爱国公约的计划，然后分头发动群众订立爱国公约。
  三、紧紧结合中心工作
    各单位爱国公约内容，包括：（一）具有政治性的具体内容，如：响应政府号召，叫干啥就干啥；检举破坏分子，揭发谣言，管制反革命分子；增加生产，支援前线，带头缴公粮，作到“一干二净三饱满”；作好代耕工作。（二）结合本身业务的内容：农民多为保证棉粮丰产，缴好公粮，作好代耕。商人多为稳定物价，薄利广销，按期缴税。其他各界各业人民，也各有不同的内容，如铁匠有一条是：“努力作好农具家伙，供给群众；提高技术，不保守，和别的铁匠多研究。”放羊工人有一条是：“保证把羊放好，不叫损坏羊羔，对国家、对人民两利。”（三）学习方面的内容，如“全家学时事，人人作宣传”。另外，还有一些是针对各自的缺点，提出改进办法的：如因家庭不和，就专订一条“家庭和睦，有事民主商量”。家庭公约中，大多有卫生工作一条，如“要作到屋净、院净、锅净、碗净、衣服净”。凡是经过群众充分讨论，“大家说，大家订，大家作”，而又订得具体通俗，好记好作的爱国公约，所起的作用都很大。
    有的单位并规定了在一定时间内的检查制度，以保证公约的全部实现并使之持久化。如城关商人在检查爱国公约中，发现白面铺掺杂面，违犯了“货真价实”一条；杂货铺抬高了市价，违犯了“稳定物价”一条。商人说：“再不要投机违犯公约了。”对公约的检查，形成了群众的自我教育运动。
    但是，该县订立与执行爱国公约较好的单位还是少数；大部分爱国公约是未经群众充分讨论的，有些地方还有干部包办、照抄别人爱国公约条文等形式主义的偏向。因此，还须要通过这次爱国捐献运动，发动群众检查爱国公约的执行情形，并补充、修订爱国公约。
