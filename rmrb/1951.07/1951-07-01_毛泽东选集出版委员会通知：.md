Notice from the Editorial Committee of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong:

　　The 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China has aroused widespread enthusiasm within the Party for studying the history of the Party. There is no doubt that systematically studying the history of the Party will greatly strengthen the Marxist-Leninist education of the entire Party, thereby greatly increasing the awareness and confidence of all Party cadres and members in the future revolutionary and construction endeavors of the Chinese people. The basic materials for studying the history of the Party should be the main works of Comrade Mao Zedong during various periods of the Chinese revolution. Because some of Comrade Mao Zedong's works have only recently been collected, and some have been collected in the past, but many people have not had the opportunity to read them, we have decided, before the publication of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong", to first select dozens of the most important works written by Comrade Mao Zedong since 1926 and publish them successively in the People's Daily starting today, except for those that are too long and need to be published as separate editions. Some of these articles have been slightly revised by the author himself in terms of wording. The explanations and annotations of each article have been reviewed by the author.

　　毛泽东选集出版委员会通知：
    中国共产党的三十周年纪念，引起了党内学习党的历史的广泛的热情。毫无疑问，有系统地学习党史，将极大地加强全党的马克思列宁主义教育，从而使全党的干部和党员在今后中国人民革命事业和建设事业中增加极大的觉悟性和信心。学习党的历史的基本材料，应当是毛泽东同志在中国革命各个时期的主要著作。因为毛泽东同志的这些著作有些直到最近才收集起来，有些过去虽然收集过，但有很多人没有获得阅读的机会，所以我们决定在《毛泽东选集》未出版前，先选择毛泽东同志从一九二六年以来所写的几十篇最重要著作，除篇幅很长的须出单行本者外，从今天起在人民日报陆续发表。这些文章中，有些经过作者自己在文字方面作了一些小的修改。各文的题解和注释均经作者审阅过。
