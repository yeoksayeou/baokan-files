Greedy for More and Bigger, Arbitrarily Increasing Established Engineering Projects
　　A Factory in Taiyuan Arbitrarily Constructs Without Approval
  　Resulting in the Misappropriation of Production Funds and Putting Work in a Passive Position
    In 1950, a certain factory in Taiyuan, during its capital construction, arbitrarily changed the engineering projects approved by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council (hereinafter referred to as the Financial Committee) and carried out construction without approval, resulting in the misappropriation of production funds and putting work in a passive position.
    In March 1950, the factory submitted a budget estimate for capital construction projects, including a construction and repair department, encompassing two engineering projects, requiring a total of over 15 billion RMB. In April, the Financial Committee approved the budget estimate. In May, the factory, based on the approved budget estimate, prepared a budget, changing the engineering projects of the construction and repair department from two to seven, requiring a total of over 44 billion RMB. The budget was submitted in May. Before the budget was submitted, the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau of the Central Heavy Industry Department ordered the factory to start construction. By June, the main projects had already commenced. In addition to the submitted budget, two more engineering projects were added and commenced in May and September, respectively. By October, the Financial Committee instructed that the project be "reserved." The Iron and Steel Bureau did not convey this instruction to the factory, and the aforementioned project continued, with most of it completed by the end of the year, costing over 26 billion RMB, mainly from misappropriated production funds. Construction continued into 1951. All projects have now been completed. After the completion of the project, two of the factory buildings had to be utilized after the fact because the original plan was inappropriate (too large). This practice violated the national investment plan and showed a degree of blindness.
    The Central Heavy Industry Department did not correct the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau and the factory’s actions, which was wrong. Similar incidents should be prevented in the future.

　　贪多好大，随意增加既定工程项目
　  太原某工厂不经批准任意施工
  　结果挪用生产资金使工作陷于被动
    太原某工厂在一九五○年进行基本建设中，曾发生自行改变政务院财政经济委员会（以下简称财委）批准的工程项目，并不经批准即行施工，结果挪用了生产资金，使工作陷于被动。
    一九五○年三月该厂提出之基本建设工程概算中，有一项为建设修造部，包括两个工程项目，共需人民币一百五十余亿元，四月，财委核准概算，五月，该厂根据核准之概算编制预算，即将修造部之工程项目由两项改为七项，共需人民币四百四十余亿元。五月，预算送出。在预算送出之前，中央重工业部钢铁工业局即令该厂先行施工，六月主要工程均已施工，并且在已报预算之外，又增加了两项工程，分别于五月和九月先后施工。至十月，财委批示该项工程“保留”；钢铁局并未把这个批示下达该厂，上述工程仍继续进行，到年终大半完成，共用人民币二百六十余亿元，其中主要是挪用的生产资金。至一九五一年工程仍继续进行。现工程均已完成。工程完成后，其中有两个厂房因原定计划不适当（大了），而不得不事后设法利用。这种做法一则抵触了国家投资计划，再则表现某种程度的盲目性。
    中央重工业部对钢铁工业局和该厂的这种做法并未加以纠正，是不对的，以后应防止同类事件发生。
