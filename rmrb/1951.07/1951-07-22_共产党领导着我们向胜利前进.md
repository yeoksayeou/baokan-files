　　The Communist Party Leads Us Forward to Victory
　　Wang Shu
    Why has the People's Liberation Army been able to achieve such great victories today? What kind of force makes it so strong and invincible?

    I would like to answer this question with some events from a regiment of the Third Field Army. This regiment is an ordinary regiment in the People's Liberation Army. When it was first established at the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, it only had four veteran Red Army companies, plus some local armed forces at the time. During the severe struggles and difficult years of the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War, relying on the leadership of the Communist Party, it continuously developed and grew stronger. Like other brother units, it was forged into a people's armed force armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, possessing a high degree of political awareness and tactical and technical skills. In the Liberation War, it annihilated enemies five or six times its own size, and the weapons and ammunition it captured were enough to equip one or two divisions. Forty model units, such as the "Luoyang Battalion," "Xuchang Company," "An Baoquan Platoon," and "Chen Jinhe Squad," emerged in the regiment, along with two to three thousand people's meritorious servants and heroes.

    Every commander and fighter of the Third Field Army knows that there is an immortal hero in this regiment: Chen Jinhe.

    One night five years ago, this regiment was fighting Kuomintang bandit troops in Boshan, northwest of Lincheng, Shandong. The enemy stubbornly resisted from a large bunker on the top of Boshan. If this bunker could not be taken before dawn, the hard work of the whole night would be wasted. At this critical moment, Chen Jinhe, the machine gun squad leader of the Second Company, stepped forward and said to the company commander, "I am a Communist Party member. For the sake of the Party and the people, my sacrifice is nothing." He immediately rushed to the bunker, pulled the pin on the only quick-firing grenade he had, and destroyed the large bunker, sacrificing himself in the violent explosion.

    Chen Jinhe was an ordinary soldier from a blacksmith background. Under the education and cultivation of the Communist Party, he felt immensely honored to be a proletarian soldier and a Communist Party member, and had a high sense of responsibility for the cause of people's liberation. Therefore, he did not hesitate to sacrifice everything, even his own life, for the liberation of the Party and the Chinese people.

    More than a year after Chen Jinhe's martyrdom, during the Tai'an Campaign, soldiers Sun Xiyou, Xu Guangming, and Xia Qipan of the First Company were besieged by hundreds of times their number of Chiang bandit troops on Haoli Mountain, a commanding height in the suburbs. They encouraged each other, saying, "Bring out the courage of Communist Party member Chen Jinhe." Inspired by Chen Jinhe's great spirit, they repelled several fierce attacks by the enemy in succession. They persisted from morning until night, until fraternal units launched an attack and annihilated the enemy. The three of them were not yet Communist Party members at that time, but they always took Communist Party members as examples and learned from them how to be strong people's fighters.

    The Communist Party organizations at all levels in the People's Liberation Army conduct class education for the troops, so that every soldier has a high degree of political awareness, knows who to love and who to hate, and has a clear stand. In the winter of 1947, when the People's Liberation Army switched to a large-scale counter-offensive, this regiment was ordered to cooperate with fraternal units to liberate the city of Luoyang. At this time, the Party organizations at all levels had just led the troops in telling their sufferings and conducting three investigations, and the soldiers' class consciousness had been significantly improved. On the way to Luoyang, the Communist Party branches of each company mobilized everyone to investigate the crimes of the Chiang bandits and landlords along the way, so that the soldiers understood more clearly for whom they were fighting. On the eve of the battle, they wrote letters of determination to the branch, saying, "We will resolutely take Luoyang, eliminate the class enemies, and avenge the suffering class brothers!"

    After the battle began, the first battalion of the regiment, which was assigned the task of assault, destroyed fifteen enemy fortifications in one night and was the first to break through the Dongguan. In the bloody battle to finally break through the two city gates, many commanders and fighters of the assault troops had been wounded several times, but they still bravely charged forward in the enemy's fire net. Some wounded soldiers crawled forward, tearing down the enemy's fortifications with their hands to allow their comrades to pass through smoothly. Many lightly wounded soldiers leaned against the city walls, allowing their comrades to climb up the city walls on their shoulders. Some soldiers ran out of bullets, so they tore stones from the city walls to strike the enemy, tore at the enemy with gun butts, and threw the enemy from the city towers. Soldier Liu Ziming was wounded three times, and one arm was broken, so he used the other hand to shoot. When the enemy concentrated its forces to launch a fierce counterattack on the city tower, the heroes shouted in unison, "As long as we are here, the city tower will be here!" Those who were lightly wounded struggled to stand up, and those who were seriously wounded also crawled up to help drive the enemy back. They ensured that the follow-up troops entered the city smoothly and annihilated the enemy.

    The Communist Party not only teaches every commander and fighter to have a high degree of political awareness, to know for whom to fight, and to fight bravely and resolutely, but also arms them with Mao Zedong's military thought, teaching them how to fight, how to combine courage with ingenuity, and how to achieve the greatest victory at the smallest cost. The Party organizations at all levels in the troops regard leading the study of tactics and techniques and promoting military democracy as one of their most important tasks. For example, in the Battle of Luoyang, the troops had not long switched to the counter-offensive, and they did not have much experience in attacking modern fortified cities. After the first battalion of the regiment accepted the task of attacking the most heavily defended east gate, the battalion Party committee immediately put forward the slogan of "Don't panic, don't be impulsive, think of ways together, don't fight unprepared battles," and launched a military democracy movement on the battlefield. Every commander and fighter carefully observed the enemy's fortifications and conducted specific and in-depth investigations and studies among the masses. Each class made a sand table based on the enemy's fortifications, and constantly held "Zhuge Liang Meetings" (tactical research meetings) to study ways to deal with each of the enemy's fortifications. All the commanders and fighters of the battalion were closely organized, and according to various possible situations in the battle, the combat tasks and combat positions of each person were specified, and exercises were repeatedly carried out to adjust their combat organization. Finally, they broke through the Dongguan first in one night.

    The Party also teaches the troops to love the people and protect the interests of the people. Not long after the liberation of Ningbo, a ship from Zhenhai carrying more than a hundred passengers was fiercely strafed by Chiang bandit planes at low altitude in the Yong River. Liu Wenhui, the battalion commander of the third battalion of the regiment and a member of the Communist Party, quickly organized anti-aircraft fire and led the commanders and fighters to jump into the river to rescue them despite the enemy planes' strafing. After rescuing the passengers ashore, they bandaged and treated the wounded, properly buried the dead, and cared for the children who had lost their parents. This spirit of loving the people demonstrated by the commanders and fighters was praised by the broad masses of the people, forming an inseparable relationship between the army and the people.

    The Party's tireless education has turned countless working people who have suffered in the old society into outstanding people's fighters and Communist Party members. For example, Zhang Ming, the famous combat hero who recently returned from visiting the Soviet Union, was originally a child from a poor peasant family. Under the Party's fourteen years of cultivation and education, he has transformed from a service member into an outstanding commander of the regiment. Liu Jingde, the company commander of the "Xuchang Company," was originally an old hired worker who had been exploited and bullied by landlords for eighteen years, and is now an outstanding combat hero and model Party member. In the Suibei Campaign, combat hero Zhang Ming was ordered to lead a battalion to capture the important commanding height, the summit of Fengshan. After a bloody battle all night, when he led his troops to launch the final assault, a piece of shrapnel flew into his head, causing him so much pain that he almost fainted. At this moment, he remembered the Party and Chairman Mao, which gave him strength all over his body. He stood firm and shouted, "We are Mao Zedong's troops, this is the time to test us, are you heroes, are you Communist Party members, follow me and charge!" All the soldiers, including those who were lightly wounded, followed him and charged up the mountain in one breath, annihilating the enemy with bayonets. In the People's Liberation Army, commanders and fighters regard striving to become a Communist Party member as their greatest desire. On the eve of every battle and in various tasks, the soldiers write letters of determination to the Party branch, requesting the Party to test them on the front lines and in their work, and to admit them into the Party.

    The development of this regiment and its various deeds fully prove that the Party's strong leadership and tireless education have made the People's Liberation Army a powerful military force with a high degree of political awareness, a high level of tactical and technical skills, and a high degree of organization and discipline. The Party makes every soldier in the People's Liberation Army the most courageous, most resolute, and most noble person who strives wholeheartedly for the cause of the people's liberation to the end. Now, this regiment, like other fraternal units, is full of determination to accelerate its construction into a powerful modern national defense force and strive to defend the motherland and world peace.

### 共产党领导着我们向胜利前进

　　共产党领导着我们向胜利前进
　　王殊
    人民解放军为什么能取得今天这样伟大的胜利？究竟是一种什么力量使得它如此坚强无敌呢？
    我想用第三野战军一个团的一些事情来回答这个问题。这个团是人民解放军中的一个普通的团。它在抗日战争初期开始建立时只有四个老红军连队，加上当时的一些地方武装。在抗日战争与解放战争的严重的斗争与艰难的岁月中，依靠着共产党的领导，它不断地发展壮大起来，像其他兄弟部队一样，它锻炼成为一个以马克思、列宁主义和毛泽东思想武装着的、具有高度的政治觉悟和战术技术素养的一支人民武装力量。它在解放战争中歼灭了超过自己五、六倍的敌人，缴获的武器弹药足够装备一、两个师。在该团中出现了“洛阳营”、“许昌连”、“安保全排”、“陈金合班”等四十个模范单位，涌现了两、三千个人民功臣和英雄模范。
    第三野战军的每一个指战员都知道在这个团里有一个不朽的英雄陈金合。
    五年以前的一个夜晚，这个团在山东临城西北的柏山和国民党匪军作战。敌人最后据守在柏山顶上的一个大碉堡里顽抗。如果在天明以前攻不下这个碉堡，一夜苦战便将全功尽弃。在这千钧一发的时刻，二连机枪班长陈金合挺身而出，他对连长说：“我是共产党员，为了党和人民，我一个人牺牲算不了什么。”他立即冲到碉堡跟前，拉响了仅有的一个快速手雷，炸毁了这个大碉堡，而自己也就在猛烈的爆炸中牺牲了。
    陈金合是一个铁匠出身的普通的战士。在共产党的教育和培养之下，他对自己是一个无产阶级战士和共产党员感到莫大的光荣，对人民解放事业具有高度的责任感；因而为了党和中国人民的解放他不惜牺牲一切，乃至自己的生命。
    在陈金合殉国一年多以后的泰安战役中，一连战士孙喜友、许光明、夏启盘三人在城郊制高点蒿里山上遭受数百倍于己的蒋匪军的围攻。他们互相鼓励说：“拿出共产党员陈金合的勇气来。”他们就在陈金合的伟大精神的鼓舞下，接连击退了敌人好几次的猛攻。从早上一直坚持到夜晚，直至兄弟部队发起攻击消灭了敌人。他们三个人那时还不是共产党员，但是他们时时刻刻以共产党员作榜样，向他们学习如何做一个坚强的人民战士。
    人民解放军中的共产党各级组织，对部队所进行的阶级教育，使每个战士都具有高度的政治觉悟，知道应该爱谁恨谁，立场分明。一九四七年冬天，人民解放军转入大反攻时，这个团奉命配合兄弟部队解放洛阳城。这时各级党的组织刚刚领导部队进行了诉苦与三查，战士们的阶级觉悟显著提高。在向洛阳进军途中，各个连队的共产党支部又发动大家沿路调查蒋匪和地主的罪行，使战士们更加清楚地明白了他们是为谁打仗的。战斗前夕他们纷纷向支部写了决心书说：“坚决打下洛阳城，消灭阶级敌人，为受苦受难的阶级兄弟报仇！”
    战斗发起后，担任突击任务的该团一营一夜间便摧毁敌人十五道坚固工事，首先突破了东关。在最后突破两道城门的血战中，突击部队的很多指战员已数次负伤，但他们仍英勇地在敌人的火力网中冲锋前进。有些负伤的战士爬着前进，用手拆毁敌人的工事，让战友们顺利通过去。很多轻伤的战士靠在城墙上，让战友们踏着他们的肩膀爬上城墙。有的战士子弹打光了，就从城墙上扒下石块来痛击敌人，用枪柄与敌人撕打，把敌人从城楼上摔下来。战士刘自明三次负伤，一只胳膊打坏了，他就用另一只手射击。当敌人集中兵力向城楼猛烈反扑的时候，勇士们一齐高呼：“有我们在就有城楼在！”负轻伤的都挣扎着站起来，重伤的也用手爬上去，一起把敌人打了下去。他们保证后续部队顺利地进入了城内，歼灭敌人。
    共产党不但教导每个指战员具有高度的政治觉悟，知道为谁而战，打得勇敢坚决，而且以毛泽东军事思想来武装他们，教导他们怎样作战，怎样使勇敢与机智相结合，以最小的代价取得最大的胜利。部队中各级党的组织都把领导学习战术技术、发扬军事民主作为他们最重要的任务之一。比如在洛阳战役中，那时部队转入反攻不久，对攻击敌人近代化设防城市的经验还不多。该团一营接受攻击设防最坚固的东门的任务后，营党委立即提出了“不着慌，不冲动，大家想办法，不打无准备的仗”的号召，展开了战场上的军事民主运动。每个指战员都仔细地观察敌人工事，向群众进行具体深入的调查研究。每个班都根据敌人的工事情况制作成沙盘，不断召开“诸葛亮会”（战术研究会），一起研究对付敌人每一道工事的办法。全营的指战员都严密地组织起来，根据战斗中各种可能发生的情况，规定了每个人的战斗任务与战斗位置，并反复进行演习，调整了自己的战斗组织，终于一夜间就首先突破了东关。
    党又教导部队热爱人民，爱护人民的利益。宁波解放后不久，有一艘从镇海驶来的满载百余乘客的轮船，在甬江中遭蒋匪飞机低空猛烈扫射。该团三营营长、中共党员刘文会，迅速组织火力对空射击，并率领指战员冒着敌机的扫射跳下江去抢救。把旅客抢救上岸后，他们又替伤者包扎治疗，妥善埋葬牺牲者，和照料失去父母的孩子。指战员这种热爱人民的精神，受到了广大人民的赞扬，使军队与人民之间形成血肉不可分离的关系。
    党的不倦的教育，使无数受尽旧社会折磨的劳动人民成为优秀的人民战士和共产党员。如最近访问苏联回国的著名战斗英雄张明，原先是一个贫苦农民家里的孩子，在党十四年的培养教育下，他从一个勤务员变成为该团的优秀的指挥员。“许昌连”连长刘景德原先是一个被地主剥削与欺侮了十八年的老雇工，而现在是一个出色的战斗英雄和模范党员。在宿北战役中，战斗英雄张明奉命率领一个营夺取重要的制高点——峰山顶。血战一夜后，当他率领部队进行最后一次突击时，一片弹片飞进他的头部，痛得他几乎昏倒下去。在这一刻他想起了党和毛主席，这使他浑身产生了力量，他站稳身子高喊道：“我们是毛泽东的队伍，这正是考验我们的时候，是英雄、是共产党员，跟我冲上去呀！”所有战士，连负轻伤的在内，都跟着他一口气冲上山顶，用刺刀消灭了敌人。在人民解放军里指战员们都以争取作一个共产党员为最大的愿望。在每一次战斗的前夕和各种工作中，战士们都向党的支部写决心书，请求党在火线上，在工作中考验他们，吸收他们入党。
    这一个团的发展及其各种事迹，充分证明了：党的坚强的领导与不倦的教育，使人民解放军成为一支具有高度政治觉悟、高度战术技术素养、高度组织性纪律性的强大军事力量。党使人民解放军中的每个战士成为全心全意为人民解放事业奋斗到底的最勇敢、最坚决和最高尚的人。现在，这一个团像其他兄弟部队一样，满怀决心，要加速把自己建设成为一支强大的近代化的国防军，为保卫祖国和世界和平而奋斗。
