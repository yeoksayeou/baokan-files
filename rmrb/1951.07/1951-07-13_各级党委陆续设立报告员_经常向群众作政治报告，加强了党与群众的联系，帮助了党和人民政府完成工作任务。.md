　　Party Committees at All Levels Establish Correspondents One After Another
    Frequently Making Political Reports to the Masses, Strengthening the Ties Between the Party and the Masses, and Helping the Party and the People's Government Complete Their Tasks.
    [Our Newspaper News] Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the "Decision on Establishing a Propaganda Network for the People's Masses in the Whole Party" on January 1st of this year, stipulating the establishment of a system of Party correspondents, Party committees at all levels above the district or county level in many parts of the country have successively established correspondents, taking on the task of making political reports to the people's masses. Correspondents have now become an important force for the Party to carry out mass propaganda work. Their work has achieved great results and has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the people.
    There are no complete statistics on the number of correspondents currently available nationwide. The following are just some figures from individual regions: In Northeast China, there were more than 6,500 correspondents at all levels by the end of April. In the Central and Southern District, the number of correspondents in the entire district, according to incomplete statistics at the end of March, was more than 2,300; there has been great development since then. For example, in Hunan, there were only 370 correspondents at the end of March, but by the end of May, this had increased to 1,183; in Guangxi Province, there were 222 correspondents at all levels by late May. In Hebei Province in June, there were 5,011 correspondents at the provincial, municipal, local, county, district, town levels and in industrial and mining enterprises. The directly affiliated organs of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee established more than 130 correspondents in April. Taiyuan City has established 111 municipal-level correspondents. In Shandong Province, according to statistics from eleven prefectural committees, four municipal committees, 112 county committees and 47 district committees at the end of April, there were a total of 1,563 correspondents. In Northern Anhui, there were 404 correspondents above the county level. In Southern Jiangsu, 169 correspondents above the prefectural and county committee levels had been established by late May. The Jinjiang Special District of Fujian has established 274 correspondents at all levels. Shanghai established 41 municipal-level correspondents in March. The Party Committee of the East China Bureau, the Party Committee of the East China Military and Political Committee, and the Party Committee of the Shanghai Railway Bureau have jointly established 151 correspondents. The Xinjiang Branch Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the provincial committees of Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia have jointly established 111 provincial-level correspondents. Xi'an has established 88 municipal and district-level correspondents. The Nanchong Special District of Northern Sichuan has established 41 county-level correspondents. Adding up only the incomplete figures from the above regions, there are already more than 18,000 correspondents at all levels. These correspondents are mostly secretaries and members of Party committees at all levels, as well as Party cadres holding leading positions in Party organs, People's Governments, People's Organizations, and major industrial and mining enterprises.
    Local correspondents have actively cooperated with the Resist-America, Aid-Korea Movement and the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, making political reports to the people's masses, which has greatly promoted the Resist-America, Aid-Korea Movement and the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries. The more than 6,500 correspondents in Northeast China worked with 170,000 propagandists in Northeast China during the large-scale Resist-America, Aid-Korea propaganda campaign in April this year to widely conduct propaganda work among the people's masses. The correspondents of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee and the municipal committees of Changsha, Hengyang, and Xiangtan, and the prefectural committees of Changde and Yuanling, etc., made political reports to more than 500,000 listeners around "May Day." From March 24th to April 5th, 54 correspondents of the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee made 91 reports on the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries to workers, students, and street residents, with an audience of over 100,300 people. From March 31st to April 29th, the correspondents of the directly affiliated organs of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee continuously went to 292 villages in Yangqu, Jinyuan, Taigu, Xugou, Yuci, Taiyuan and other counties, making reports on resisting America, aiding Korea and suppressing counter-revolutionaries to more than 93,000 people (accounting for 54 percent of all villagers), greatly enhancing the enthusiasm of the masses for resisting America, aiding Korea and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Many peasants automatically expressed their determination to resist America and aid Korea with practical actions after listening to the reports, and many people automatically reported counter-revolutionary elements to the correspondents. In Qingyuan County, Hebei, 42 county-level and district-level correspondents made more than 310 reports in a period of more than a month until May 15th, with an audience of more than 140,000 people. During the Resist-America, Aid-Korea propaganda campaign in April, 26 correspondents from the Tangshan Prefectural Committee of Hebei went to nine factories and the rural areas of thirteen counties to make reports. In addition, they also made reports to some cadres and students, with a total audience of 62,230 people, exceeding the audience of the reports and speeches made by all members of the Tangshan Prefectural Committee in the past year. After listening to the reports of the correspondents and understanding the content and significance of the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries", the people of all circles in Baoding City greatly increased their enthusiasm for suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and all automatically reported and secretly reported counter-revolutionary elements to the government, and assisted the government in monitoring counter-revolutionary elements. In the movement against the US arming of Japan, 32 correspondents in Xuzhou made reports to more than 40,000 people. In April, 31 municipal-level correspondents and 15 district-level correspondents in Xi'an made reports to more than 80,000 people. These reports had a great educational effect on the people's masses.
    The people's masses in various places warmly support the Party's correspondent system and welcome correspondents to make reports to them. When the workers of the Shenxin Yarn Factory in Wuhan heard the news that Mayor Wu Defeng was going to give a report, they jumped up with joy. After listening to the report, they all said, "I hope you come a few more times," and said, "It is really different from the past that a mayor automatically comes to the factory to speak to us." Comrade Zhou Zhenhua, a correspondent of the Tangshan Prefectural Committee, traveled to Liuzhai Village in the western mountainous area of Qian'an County, 350 miles away from Tangshan, to give a report, which moved the residents of the village very much. Some even shed tears. They said, "The Communist Party always cares about this remote place, fearing that we will not have a good life. Now the leader is here to give us ideas and talk about national affairs. We must produce well and turn the poor mountains into rich mountains to repay this kindness!" After listening to the reports of the correspondents of the directly affiliated organs of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee, the peasants in the counties near Taiyuan City asked them to "come often" and "stay longer," and submitted their opinions on the government and the Party's various tasks and the work style of cadres to the correspondents. After listening to the reports of the correspondents, the people of Xuzhou said, "It would be great if we could hear such reports once or twice a month," and said, "In the past, when we asked leaders to report, we were afraid that the leaders were busy, and we also lacked many reasons to ask them to come. Now that the Party has regulations, we can ask the leaders to report."
    The experience of various places proves that the Party's correspondent system can not only greatly improve the Party's propaganda work to the people's masses, so that the people's masses can have a more systematic understanding of the Party's political views and various policies in a certain period, so as to supplement the shortcomings of the work of propagandists; but also help correct the phenomenon that some Party cadres do not pay attention to politics at ordinary times, enliven the Party's political life, and urge Party leaders to directly contact the masses and strengthen the Party's ties with the people's masses. Comrade Tao Lujia, Deputy Secretary and Minister of Propaganda of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee, explained the situation of the directly affiliated organs of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee after the establishment of the correspondent system in a report: "After the establishment of the correspondent system, the effect is very good. The masses welcome it, the cadres are excited, and the political atmosphere in the organs is also obviously different. In the past, although there were regular four-hour study sessions on current affairs policies every week, the atmosphere was very dull, and the cadres felt bored. Now, because learning is for use, everyone is nervous, debates, seminars, and speech practice are all carried out." There are many similar examples in other places. These facts show that the correspondent system has had a good impact on the Party's internal life.
    In order to make the work of the correspondents more planned and regular, the Party committees in many regions have formulated some good systems, such as formulating report work plans on a regular basis; specifically dividing the report areas and targets of the correspondents, implementing a "contract system" to establish regular contact between the correspondents and the masses; implementing a report inspection card system to regularly inspect the work of the correspondents, etc. In all places where these systems are implemented, the work of the correspondents can be continuously improved and gradually become regular. In places that have not done so, the work of the correspondents seems very irregular. Some local Party committees have not even given due attention to the work of the correspondents, allowing it to drift without leadership. Individual local correspondents are even nominal, and do not make political reports to the masses. There are also some Party cadres who use the excuse of being afraid of delaying business work to express their unwillingness to take on the work of correspondents. All these hinder the further strengthening of the Party's correspondent system and must be resolutely corrected.

　　各级党委陆续设立报告员
    经常向群众作政治报告，加强了党与群众的联系，帮助了党和人民政府完成工作任务。
    【本报讯】自从中共中央于今年一月一日发布了“关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定”，规定建立党的报告员制度以来，全国许多地方的区或县以上各级党的委员会都已陆续设立了报告员，担任对人民群众作政治报告的任务。报告员现在已成为党进行群众宣传工作的一个重要力量，他们的工作已经获得很大成绩，并受到广大人民的热烈欢迎。
    现在全国已有的报告员的数目尚无完全统计，下面只是一些个别地区的数字：东北至四月底已有各级报告员六千五百多名。中南区全区的报告员数目，在三月底时，据不完全统计是二千三百余名；以后又有很大发展，例如湖南在三月底只有报告员三百七十名，至五月底已增至一千一百八十三人；广西省至五月下旬已有各级报告员二百二十二名。河北省在六月间已有省、市、地方、县、区、镇级及工矿企业报告员五千零一十一名。山西省委直属机关在四月间已设立了报告员一百三十多名。太原市已设立了市级报告员一百一十一人。山东省在四月底，据十一个地委、四个市委、一百一十二个县委及四十七个分区委的统计，共有报告员一千五百六十三名。皖北已有县级以上报告员四百零四名。苏南至五月下旬已设立地委及县委级以上报告员一百六十九名。福建晋江专区已设立各级报告员二百七十四名。上海在三月间即已设立了市级报告员四十一名。华东局机关党委、华东军政委员会机关党委及上海铁路局党委已共建立了报告员一百五十一名。中共中央新疆分局及甘肃、青海、宁夏等省委已共设立省级报告员一百一十一名。西安已设立市及区级报告员八十八名。川北南充专区已设立县级报告员四十一名。仅把以上一些地区的不完全数字合计，即已共有各级报告员一万八千多名。这些报告员大都是各级党的委员会的书记和委员，及在党的机关、人民政府、人民团体和各主要工矿企业中担任领导工作的党员干部。
    各地报告员都曾积极地配合抗美援朝运动及镇压反革命运动向人民群众作了政治报告，对于抗美援朝运动及镇压反革命运动起了很大的推动作用。东北区的六千五百多名报告员在今年四月大规模抗美援朝宣传运动中曾与东北十七万个宣传员一起广泛地向人民群众进行了宣传工作。湖南省委及长沙、衡阳、湘潭等市委和常德、沅陵等地委的报告员在“五一”前后共向五十多万听众作了政治报告。武汉市委五十四名报告员从三月二十四日至四月五日共向工人、学生及街道居民作了九十一次关于镇压反革命问题的报告，听众达十万零三千多人。山西省委直属机关的报告员从三月三十一日至四月二十九日连续到阳曲、晋源、太谷、徐沟、榆次、太原等县的二百九十二个村庄，向九万三千多群众（占全部村民的百分之五十四）作了关于抗美援朝及镇压反革命的报告，大大提高了群众对抗美援朝及镇压反革命的积极性，许多农民在听过报告后都自动表示决心以实际行动抗美援朝，并有许多人自动向报告员检举反革命分子。河北清苑县四十二名县级及区级报告员在至五月十五日止的一个多月的时间里共作了三百一十多次报告，听众达十四万多人。河北唐山地委二十六个报告员在四月间的抗美援朝宣传运动中，到九个工厂和十三个县的农村作了报告，此外并对一部分干部及学生作了报告，听众共达六万二千二百三十人，超过了唐山地委各委员在去年一年中报告和讲话的听众。保定市各界人民在听过报告员的报告，了解了“中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例”的内容和意义后，大大提高了镇压反革命的积极性，都自动向政府检举、密报反革命分子，并协助政府监视反革命分子。徐州市的三十二名报告员在反对美国武装日本的运动中向四万多群众作了报告。西安市的三十一名市级报告员和十五名区级报告员在四月份共向八万多人作了报告。这些报告对人民群众都有极大的教育作用。
    各地人民群众都热烈拥护党的报告员制度，欢迎报告员去向他们作报告。武汉市申新纱厂工人听到市长吴德峰去作报告的消息后，高兴得跳起来，听过报告后都说：“希望多来几次”，并说：“一个市长自动地下厂来给我们讲话，这真是与前不同了。”唐山地委报告员周振华同志远到离唐山三百五十里的迁安县西部山区刘寨村作报告，使该村居民十分感动，有的竟掉下泪来，他们说：“共产党始终是惦念这块偏僻的地方，怕咱们日子过不好，现在首长来给我们出主意，讲国家大事，我们一定要好好生产，变穷山为富山，来报答这份心！”太原市附近各县的农民听过山西省委直属机关报告员的报告后，要求他们“常来”“多住”，并纷纷把对政府及党的各项工作和干部作风的意见提交报告员。徐州市人民在听过报告员的报告后，说：“像这样的报告，我们每月能听到一次到两次就好了”，并且说：“我们过去请首长报告时，怕首长忙，也缺乏很多理由要他们一定来，现在党已有了规定，我们就可请首长作报告了。”
    各地的经验证明，党的报告员制度不但可以大大改善党对人民群众的宣传工作，使人民群众能比较有系统地了解党在一定时期的政治主张和各种政策，以补宣传员工作之不足；而且可以帮助纠正一部分党员干部平时不注意政治的现象，活跃党内的政治生活，并督促党的领导干部去直接接触群众，加强党与人民群众的联系。山西省委副书记兼宣传部长陶鲁笳同志在一个报告中说明山西省委直属机关在建立报告员制度以后的情形道：“报告员制度建立起来后，效果很好，群众欢迎，干部兴奋，机关里的政治空气也显然不同了，过去每星期虽然照常有四小时学习时事政策，但是空气是很沉闷的，干部感到厌烦。现在因为学是为了用，大家就紧张起来了，辩论呀，座谈呀，练习演讲呀，都搞起来了。”其他各地也有不少类似的例子。这些事实说明报告员制度已给党内生活以良好影响。
    许多地区的党的委员会为了使报告员的工作做得更有计划，并能经常化，已制定了一些很好的制度，例如按期制定报告工作计划；具体划分报告员的报告地区和对象，实行“包干制”，使报告员与群众建立经常联系；实行报告检查卡片制度，以经常检查报告员的工作情况等。凡是实行了这些制度的地方，报告员的工作都能得到不断的改进，并逐渐趋于经常化。未这样作的地方，报告员的工作就显得很不经常。有些地方的党委甚至尚未对报告员工作给以应有的重视，任其自流而不加领导。有个别地方的报告员甚至形同虚设，不向群众作政治报告。也有一些党员干部借口怕耽搁业务工作，表示不愿担负报告员的工作。这些都妨碍党的报告员制度的进一步加强，必须坚决加以纠正。
