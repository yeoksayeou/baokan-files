　　【Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Kaesong, July 29th】 Our newspaper's special correspondent reports: The eagerness of American soldiers and lower-ranking officers to immediately cease fire and go home is clearly demonstrated by the American engineers participating in the repair of Panmunjom Bridge. Panmunjom Bridge is located near Panmunjom, about thirty miles east of Kaesong, and is the only way for the United Nations Command delegation to enter the Kaesong Neutral Zone. This bridge had long been bombed by American planes after the outbreak of the war, so the United Nations Command delegation's motorcade had to wade through the river. On July 20, the river suddenly rose, and vehicles could not pass, causing the negotiations to be interrupted for a day. The engineers of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers on the west side of the bridge decided to repair this bridge, which is about 100 meters long, so that the United Nations Command motorcade could pass over the bridge. American engineers also participated in this repair work. The two sides took the center of the bridge as the boundary, each repairing the east and west ends, and agreed to start work at 2:00 PM on July 20th and complete it within four hours. The Volunteer engineers guaranteed to complete the task on time. The general call of the American engineers was: "We must repair the bridge today, and we must not delay tomorrow's negotiations!" One American soldier said: "Repairing the bridge will allow the negotiations to succeed one day earlier, and we can go home one day earlier!" For this desire to return home as soon as possible, the American soldiers also worked actively. During the break, some American engineers took out photos of their wives and said to people: "Let the war stop as soon as possible, so I can go home and reunite with my family." An American truck driver said: "I can't fight this war for another day! My mother is worried about me every day. Let's negotiate successfully as soon as possible! I want to go home and get married." An American officer said: "In the past, I was really confused, but this time I am no longer confused. I want to see who is preventing us from going home earlier, and who sincerely wants peace."
    At 6:00 PM, both sides completed their bridge repair tasks on time. The American engineers happily ran to the Volunteer engineers and said: "Listen for good news from the peace talks tomorrow!" A Volunteer engineer said to them: "I hope that this bridge that we jointly repaired today will help the cause of peace and construction in Korea in the future." The American engineers immediately replied: "No more war! No more war!"
    July 26th was the day when the two delegations reached an agreement on the agenda of the armistice negotiations. An American officer ran to the center of the bridge and shook hands with the Volunteer engineers to express his congratulations. He took off his steel helmet and made a gesture to throw it away, and then said: "I don't want to wear this heavy thing anymore!" When an American engineer talked about our side's proposal that all foreign troops withdraw from Korea, they said one after another: "Why don't we withdraw? Everyone wants to go home as soon as possible!"

　　美军在开城修桥工兵急盼停战回家
    【本报开城二十九日电】本报特派记者报道：美军士兵和下级军官们希望立即停战回家的急切心情，从参加修复板门桥的美国工兵们身上，明显地表现了出来。板门桥在开城以东约三十华里的板门店附近，为联合国军代表团进入开城中立区的必经之地。这座桥在战争爆发后，早就被美国飞机炸坏了，所以联合国军代表团的汽车队是涉水而过的。七月二十日，河水陡涨，车辆不能通过，使谈判中断了一天。在桥西的中国人民志愿军某部工兵，决定修复这座约一百公尺长的桥梁，以便联合国军汽车队从桥上通过。美军的工兵也参加这项修复工作。双方以桥中心为界，各修东、西两端，并约定在七月二十日下午两点钟动工，四小时内完工。志愿军工兵保证按时完成任务。美军工兵们的普遍呼声是：“一定要在今天把桥修好，绝不能再耽误明天的谈判！”一位美军士兵说：“把桥修好，让谈判早成功一天，我们就可以早一天回家！”美国兵为了这个早日停战回家的愿望，也积极工作起来。在休息的时候，美国工兵有的就拿出自己妻子的照片来对人说：“让战争早日停止下来吧，我就可以回家去和家人们团聚。”一个美军汽车司机说：“这个战争我一天也打不下去了！母亲天天在替我耽心事。赶快谈成功吧！我好回家去结婚。”一个美军军官说：“过去我的确是糊里糊涂的，这次我可不再糊涂了。我要看看到底是谁不让我们早些回家去，谁是真心想和平。”
    下午六点钟，双方都按时完成了自己的修桥任务。美军工兵高兴地跑到志愿军工兵面前说：“明天听和谈会议的好消息！”志愿军的一位工兵对他们说：“我希望我们今天共同修复的这座桥，对以后朝鲜的和平建设事业有所帮助。”美国工兵们立即回答说：“再不要战争！再不要战争！”
    七月二十六日是双方代表团在停战谈判议程上取得协议的一天，一个美军军官跑到桥中心，找志愿军工兵握手，表示庆祝。他摘下头上的钢盔，作了一个要摔掉它的动作，接着说：“我再也不愿意戴这个沉重的玩意儿了！”一位美国工兵在谈到我方所主张的一切外国军队撤出朝鲜的问题时纷纷表示：“我们为什么不撤走呢？谁都希望早些回家去呀！”
