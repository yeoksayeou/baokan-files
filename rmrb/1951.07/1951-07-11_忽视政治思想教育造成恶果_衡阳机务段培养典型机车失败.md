Neglecting Political Thought Education Leads to Bad Results
    Hengyang Locomotive Depot Fails to Cultivate Model Locomotive

    In the model locomotive team movement, the Hengyang Railway Administration's Hengyang Locomotive Depot only provided material care for model locomotives, neglecting the political education of the crew, leading to the model crew becoming detached from the masses. Several attempts to cultivate model locomotives have failed.

    In promoting the model locomotive team movement, the bureau, after determining certain locomotives at the Hengyang Locomotive Depot as objects for cultivation, only told the Hengyang Locomotive Depot chief, "If the model fails, you are responsible!" In daily work, they only asked for plans and reports, without providing concrete help, and even less was done in political and ideological education. Fearing the failure of the model, and lacking positive measures, the depot cadres developed several extremely incorrect ideas and practices: (1) Shielding the model locomotive and concealing accidents. For example, the "No. 914" locomotive had a signal overrun accident in August of last year (passing a signal indicating no further progress), and the driver, Gu Jun (a Communist Party member), informed the depot's Communist Party branch secretary of the accident. The branch secretary told the depot chief. Fearing the failure of the model, the depot chief concealed the accident and did not report it to higher authorities. At that time, the depot's drivers already knew that the "No. 914" locomotive had an accident, but they did not dare to report it to higher authorities. They said, "The higher-ups want us to cultivate a model, whether it's good or bad. We'd better keep quiet to avoid being labeled." As a result, thirty-three accidents involving the depot's eleven locomotives were concealed. (2) Giving special, unprincipled material care to the locomotives being cultivated, without conducting political and ideological education. For example, the model locomotive crew could receive more kerosene and cotton yarn for cleaning, as well as more repair materials; the deputy chief of operations, Cui Chengming, said, "We must take care of the model locomotive's mileage." (3) Cultivating models solely for the sake of the depot's "good performance," simply encouraging the crew to pursue bonuses and red flags. The depot chief told the model locomotive crew, "If you do well, you can get more bonuses and win more red flags for our depot." This caused some crew members to think that participating in competitions was just about getting bonuses, only considering personal glory, merit, and bonuses, and looking down on ordinary locomotive crew members. The model crew became detached from the masses, and the masses were very dissatisfied with the model crew's arrogance and complacency. When the model locomotive created a new record, the leading cadres did not help summarize the experience and promote it, but let it fend for itself. This made the model isolated, unable to improve, and unable to play its due role.

    Using this method to cultivate model locomotives, the depot has selected several objects but failed to achieve any results. The Hengyang Railway Administration has noticed this mistake at the Hengyang Locomotive Depot and has sent people to conduct an in-depth inspection. The depot's model locomotive crew members have also voluntarily reported the concealed accidents and made self-criticisms to the masses. The depot chief has also made a self-criticism.

### 忽视政治思想教育造成恶果  衡阳机务段培养典型机车失败

　　忽视政治思想教育造成恶果
    衡阳机务段培养典型机车失败
    衡阳铁路管理局衡阳机务段，在开展模范机车队运动中，单纯地在物质上照顾典型机车，忽视了对于乘务员的政治教育，以致模范乘务员脱离了群众，先后培养几个典型机车都失败了。
    该局在推行模范机车队运动中，确定以衡阳机务段的某些机车为培养典型的对象以后，只是向衡阳机务段段长说：“典型垮了，你负责任！”在日常工作中只是要计划、要表报，而没有进行具体的帮助，在政治思想教育方面做的更差。该段干部因害怕典型垮台，而又没有积极的办法，就产生了几种极不正确的思想和做法：（一）包庇典型机车，隐瞒事故。如“九一四号”机车曾于去年八月份发生冒进信号事故（看到不得前进的信号却越过了），司机顾钧（党员）把事故情况告知该段中共支部书记，支部书记转告了该段段长。段长因为怕典型垮台，就把这件事故隐瞒起来，不向上级报告。当时该段司机已经知道“九一四号”机车出了事故，但都不敢向上级反映。他们说：“上级叫培养的典型，好也是好，不好也是好。我们最好不作声，免得扣帽子。”这样，该段十一台机车，出了三十三件事故，都被隐瞒了。（二）对于正在培养的典型机车，单纯从物质上给以无原则的特殊照顾，而不进行政治、思想教育。比如典型机车乘务员可以多领擦车用的火油、棉纱以及检修材料；典型机车可以多跑车次；运转副主任崔成明说：“要照顾典型机车的走行公里。”（三）只是为本段的“成绩好”而培养典型，单纯地鼓励乘务员追求奖金和红旗。该段段长对典型机车乘务员说：“你们好好干，可以多得奖，多给我们段上争两面红旗。”使得有些乘务员认为搞竞赛就是拿奖金，专为个人的光荣、功绩和奖金打算，并且看不起一般机车乘务员。模范乘务员脱离了群众，群众对于模范乘务员的骄傲自满也非常不满。典型机车创造了新纪录，领导干部也不帮助总结经验，加以推广，而是让它自生自灭。这就使典型陷于孤立，没法提高；也不能发挥它应有的作用。
    该段用这样的方法培养典型机车，先后选择了好几个对象都没有培养出什么成绩。对于衡阳机务段的这种错误，衡阳铁路管理局已经注意，并派人进行了深入的检查。该段典型机车乘务员们，也自动地报告了隐瞒的事故，并向群众作了检讨。该段段长也作了自我检讨。
