To the Editor:

　　Comrade Han Chunyu, a worker at the Handan Wharf Distillery, after listening to the propaganda about patriotic cotton sales, understood the importance of selling stored cotton to support the production of yarn mills. He took a day off to go home and sell his stored cotton. On the afternoon of the day he returned home, he carried more than eighty kilograms of stored cotton to Handan City. It was after five o'clock in the afternoon when he carried the cotton to the warehouse of the Cotton, Yarn & Cloth Company. The comrades at the warehouse said, "We don't accept cotton here, go to the Second Cotton Collection Point to sell it." When he arrived at the Second Cotton Collection Point, the comrades there said, "We are off work, come back tomorrow." Han Chunyu said, "I only took one day off, please accept it no matter what." The reply he received was, "The weigher is not here, and the accountant has left." So he carried it to the Trust Company, but he received the same reply at the Trust Company: "We are off work, come back tomorrow." Comrade Han Chunyu was afraid of being late for work the next day, and also wanted to sell the cotton. There was no way but to carry the cotton to his organization - the Handan Town Federation of Trade Unions. The trade union cadres immediately helped him negotiate with the Trust Company, and the cotton was sold that evening.

　　This incident, on the one hand, showed the worker comrades' concern for the country's difficulties and their emphasis on patriotic cotton sales, and on the other hand, it fully illustrates that some state-owned trading organizations' staff in Handan Town have not understood the important significance of cotton purchase and storage work for the country from a political perspective. Their bureaucratic attitude towards this work is intolerable.

　　邯郸镇某些国营贸易工作人员用官僚主义态度对待购棉工作编辑同志：
    邯郸码头酒厂工人韩春雨同志，听了关于爱国售棉的宣传以后，了解到出售存棉支援纱厂生产的重要，他就请假一日，回家出卖存棉。他回家的当天下午，就把家中的八十多斤存棉担到邯郸城里。那是下午五点多钟，他把棉担到花纱布公司仓库，仓库的同志说：“这里不收花，你到第二收棉处去卖吧。”他到了第二收棉处，第二收棉处的同志说：“下班了，明天再来吧。”韩春雨说：“我就只请了一天假，无论如何请你收下吧。”他得到的回答是：“称官不在，会计也出了门。”于是他又担到信托公司，但是他在信托公司也得到了同样的回答：“下班了，明天来吧。”韩春雨同志又怕误了明天上班，又愿意卖棉花，没有办法，只好担着棉花去找自己的组织——邯郸镇总工会，工会干部立刻帮助他向信托公司办了交涉，在当天晚上将棉花出售了。
    这件事一方面表现了工人同志关心国家困难及对爱国售棉的重视，同时也充分说明邯郸镇某些国营贸易机关的工作人员未从政治上了解购棉储棉工作对国家的重要意义，他们以这种官僚主义的态度来对待这件工作，是不能容忍的。
