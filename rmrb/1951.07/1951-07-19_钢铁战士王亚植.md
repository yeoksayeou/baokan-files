　　American aggressor soldiers, in order to escape the battlefield, wound themselves. The volunteer army's brave soldiers, even when wounded, refuse to leave the front lines. This explains why the Korean and Chinese People's Army, fighting for anti-aggression, can defeat the American aggressor army, which has superior equipment. Steel Warrior Wang Yazhi is one of the thousands of such soldiers in the Volunteer Army.
　　Wang Yazhi is from southern Anhui. He was a ammunition handler in a small artillery squad of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army. On April 22nd, when the Korean and Chinese People's forces launched a strong counterattack, Wang Yazhi traveled through the enemy's artillery fire net to transport ammunition. On his fifth trip to deliver ammunition to the front, he was hit in the chest by shrapnel and fainted. After a while, he struggled to get up, bandaged the wound, and continued to carry the heavy ammunition box to the front. He did not go to the dressing station on the way back, but instead walked to the ammunition depot, carried another box of ammunition, and advanced with heavy steps. He knew that as long as his comrades had more ammunition, they could kill more enemies. Although his legs were weak, he was covered in sweat, and the wound was in severe pain, he still insisted on completing the task.
　　That night, the troops began to pursue the enemy. Wang Yazhi, as before, carried a 40-odd-pound ammunition box and marched with his comrades. He supported himself with amazing perseverance, not letting others discover that he was injured. The next night, he was hit in the buttocks by shrapnel while performing a task. He bandaged the wound himself and still refused to tell anyone. April 26th was the fourth day he had been pursuing the enemy with the troops, wounded. Due to the continuous heavy rain and muddy roads, he did not know how many times he had fallen, and when he fell, he would prop himself up. The wound throbbed with pain, but he did not utter a sound. His incomparable hatred for the enemy allowed him to overcome the physical pain. In the end, the wound festered, and he had to go to the doctor. When the doctor uncovered the bandage, he not only found that the wound had festered, but also discovered that there was a piece of shrapnel inside that had not been removed. He couldn't help but pay his respects to this firm and tenacious warrior.
　　After the company commander learned of this, he immediately decided to send him to a rear hospital for recuperation. This steel warrior said anxiously: "Now is the time when the fighting is fierce, I would rather die than leave the front line!" The company commander still wanted him to return to the rear immediately. He said even more anxiously: "As long as I don't sacrifice, I will fight to the end. Once the shrapnel is taken out, it won't hinder my combat, I will never leave the front line!" In the end, the company commander had no choice but to decide to keep him at the front-line medical station to recover from his injuries. When the second phase of the counterattack began, this steel warrior, whose injury had not fully healed, resolutely demanded to join the ranks of combat.

　　钢铁战士王亚植

    美国侵略军的士兵们，为了想脱离战场而自己把自己打伤，志愿军的勇士们却负了伤都不肯下火线。这也就说明了为反侵略而战的朝、中人民军队，为什么能战胜在装备上占优势的美国侵略军。钢铁战士王亚植就是志愿军里千万个这样的战士之中的一个。
    王亚植是皖南人，在志愿军某部小炮班当弹药手。四月二十二日朝、中人民部队发起强大反击时，王亚植穿行在敌人炮火网中运送弹药。在他第五次把弹药运上阵地时，胸部被炮弹片击伤，晕倒在地上。停了一会，他挣扎起来包扎好伤口，继续把沉重的弹药箱送上阵地。往回走时他没有上包扎所去，却依旧向弹药所走去，又扛上一箱弹药，拖着沉重的脚步前进。他知道战友们只要有了更多的弹药，就能杀死更多的敌人。虽然他双腿发软，浑身流汗，创口发生剧痛，但是他仍坚持完成了任务。
    当天晚上，部队开始追击敌人，王亚植和以前一样背着四十多斤的弹药箱，和战友们一起行军。他用惊人的毅力支持着自己，不让别人发现他受了伤。第二天夜晚，他在执行任务时臀部又被炮弹片打伤，他自己包扎了伤口。还是不肯告诉别人。四月二十六日，这是他带伤随着部队追击作战的第四天。由于连日大雨，道路泥泞，他不知摔了多少次跤，跌倒了他又撑起来。创口一阵阵地作痛，他却没有哼一声，对敌人的无比仇恨心使他战胜了肉体上的痛苦。到最后，伤口溃烂了，他不得不去找医生。医生揭开绷带一看，不仅伤口已经溃烂，而且发现里面还有一块炮弹碎片没有取出，不由对这位坚毅顽强的战士肃然起敬。
    连长知道了这件事以后，立刻决定要他到后方医院去休养。这位钢铁战士发急说：“现在正是打得激烈的时候，我死也不下火线！”连长还是要他立刻回后方，他更着急地说：“只要我不牺牲，我是要战斗到底的。弹片取出了，就不会妨碍我作战，我决不下火线！”最后连长只得决定把他留在前线医疗所养伤。当第二阶段反击战开始的时候，这个伤还没有完全好的钢铁战士，又坚决要求参加战斗的行列。
