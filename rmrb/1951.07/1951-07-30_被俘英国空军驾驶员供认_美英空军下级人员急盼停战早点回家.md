Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, July 29th – Harry Mitcharl, a British Air Force pilot captured by the Chinese People's Volunteers, confessed that lower-ranking personnel in the U.S. and British Air Forces all hope that the armistice negotiations will succeed so they can go home sooner. He said, "When the news that Malik proposed a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue reached the American airfields, it attracted everyone on the field like a magnet. American mechanics who were repairing planes happily jumped off the planes, airport personnel who were carrying ammunition to the planes immediately stopped working, and even some pilots who were feigning illness out of fear of being killed jumped out of bed. Everyone was shouting: We're going home!" Then he said with annoyance, "Just as we were happy, orders came down from the superiors for us to take off and bomb. I really don't understand why the American generals are holding armistice negotiations with you on the one hand, and on the other hand sending planes to bomb the Korean people even more frequently!"

Harry Mitcharl is a Second Lieutenant pilot in the Second Squadron of the Anglo-American mixed 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing, who was transferred to Korea from South Africa on June 9th of this year. On the afternoon of July 23rd, four P-51 aircraft from the squadron flew to strafe and bomb the highway and villages 20 kilometers northeast of Kaesong, and three of them were immediately shot down by the Volunteers' anti-aircraft gunners. Harry Mitcharl parachuted and was captured. The two pilots in the other two planes parachuted down onto village houses that had been set on fire by their own strafing and were both burned to death. According to Harry Mitcharl, although the activities of the U.S. and British Air Forces have become more frequent during the negotiation period, the blows they have suffered have also become heavier. In the two weeks since the Kaesong negotiations began on July 10th, the squadron has bombed, strafed, and scouted the area south of Pyongyang every day, and has suffered losses every day. During this period, with continuous losses and continuous replenishment, 20 aircraft in the squadron have been shot down or damaged (note: a squadron consists of 12 aircraft, 20 aircraft is equal to one and two-thirds squadrons), and 16 pilots have lost their lives. He said, "The American government should sincerely seek peace, quickly withdraw us from Korea, and let us go home sooner."

　　被俘英国空军驾驶员供认
　  美英空军下级人员急盼停战早点回家
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十九日电】被中国人民志愿军俘掳的英国空军驾驶员哈里·米查里，供认美、英空军中的下级人员都希望停战谈判能够成功，让他们可以早点回家。他说：“当马立克提出和平解决朝鲜问题的消息传到美军飞机场上时，它就像磁石一样吸引住了机场上的人们。正在修理飞机的美国机械师高兴得从飞机上跳了下来，正向飞机上搬运弹药的机场人员马上停止了工作，连一些因为害怕被打死而装病的驾驶员也从床上跳了下来。大家都嚷着：我们就要回家了！”接着他又懊恼地说：“正当我们高兴的时候，上级要我们出发轰炸的命令却又下来了。我真不明白，为什么美国的将军们一面和你们举行停战谈判，一面却又更加频繁地派飞机轰炸朝鲜人民！”
    哈里·米查里是美英混合第十八战斗轰炸联队英国空军第二中队的少尉驾驶员，本年六月九日才从南非调来朝鲜。七月二十三日下午，该中队的四架Ｐ——五一型飞机，飞到开城东北二十公里的公路和村庄上空扫射轰炸，当即被志愿军的对空射击手击落了其中的三架。哈里·米查里跳伞被俘。另外两架飞机里的两个驾驶员，跳伞降落在被他们自己扫射得烧起来了的村庄房屋上，都被烧死了。据哈里·米查里供称：美、英空军在谈判期中的活动虽然更加频繁，可是它们受到的打击也更沉重。自七月十日开城谈判开始后的两周内，该中队每天都到平壤以南地区轰炸、扫射和侦察，每天都遭到了损失。在此期间，该中队在不断损失不断补充的情况下，已有二十架飞机被击落或击伤（按：一个中队为十二架飞机，二十架等于一又三分之二个中队的编制），有十六个驾驶员送了命。他说：“美国政府应该诚心诚意地谋求和平，赶快把我们从朝鲜撤走，让我们早些回家去。”
