    Communist Party Members in the May Counterattack

    In the May battles south of the Chaoyang River, which annihilated the 38th and 23rd Regiments of the US 2nd Infantry Division, the Chinese Communist Party members in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army led their non-Party comrades in over forty continuous forced attacks, penetrating the enemy's heart and wiping them out.

    The US 38th Regiment had built many碉堡 (碉堡 - blockhouses) and bunkers on Gary Mountain, which they occupied. They set up three to five layers of barbed wire in front of their positions, hung flares in the trees, and buried trip flares containing illuminating projectiles underground. The enemy also used tons of bombs and shells to bombard the forty-mile-wide area between the Chaoyang River and Gary Mountain day and night. The enemy called this fire zone a "zone where living things cannot survive." But the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army charged up Gary Mountain from this fire zone. And the Chinese Communist Party members were the ones who took the lead in opening up the road to victory.蔺有土 (Lin Youtu), the Communist Party member and squad leader of an engineer squad of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, first used explosives to blow open a gap in the barbed wire. He shouted, "Comrades, charge through this gap!" The warriors surged through the gap, avoided the landmines, and, using the light of the flares fired by the enemy, climbed the cliffs, seized the machine guns in the enemy bunkers, and covered the advance of their comrades attacking from the front.

    Another unit attacking the mountaintop broke through several layers of the enemy's barbed wire and charged into the enemy's position in the face of intense enemy fire. The first to rush into the enemy's position was Communist Party member 田际法 (Tian Jifa), who held his injured stomach with one hand and fired his automatic gun non-stop with the other. The comrades behind him also broke into the enemy's position and engaged the enemy in hand-to-hand combat.

    After occupying the main peak of Gary Mountain, the Volunteer Army warriors rushed straight to Dashuidong (大水洞), the south entrance of Gary Mountain, where the headquarters of the US 38th Regiment was located. Communist Party members demonstrated unparalleled heroism in the battle. 田学孔 (Tian Xuekong), a Communist Party member of the 9th Company, was wounded in both hands and both feet but remained on the front line. 白美堂 (Bai Meitang), a Communist Party member of the 4th Squad of the 3rd Company, automatically took over as squad leader after the squad leader was killed in action, and successively took down three bunkers, capturing more than twenty enemies. 张三孔 (Zhang Sankong), a Communist Party member of the 1st Platoon of the 3rd Company, stepped forward to act as platoon leader. He led his comrades in defeating a counterattack by the enemy, who outnumbered them by dozens of times. Although the US 38th Regiment resisted desperately, it still could not escape the fate of being mostly annihilated.

    While the battle of Gary Mountain was in full swing, the Volunteer Army took advantage of the victory and sent a detachment deep into the enemy's rear, quickly crushing the French battalion blocking both sides of the Hongchuan-Yanggu Highway and cutting off the US 23rd Regiment. The enemy organized tanks and armored vehicles to launch a counterattack in an attempt to escape. At this time, the Communist Party members in the Volunteer Army stood at the forefront to meet the enemy. 张则云 (Zhang Zeyun), the Communist Party member and leader of the demolition team, rushed up and blew up the first tank in the face of intense enemy tank fire. Then he rushed into the rolling smoke and bombed the enemy's armored vehicles and cars behind the tank. 魏海荣 (Wei Hairong), a Communist Party member and machine gunner guarding the flank of the road junction, let the enemy's tanks pass and swept the enemy's car group behind the tanks. The enemy's tank fire was directed at him intensively, his fortifications were destroyed, and he was buried in the soil. After he climbed out, he continued to fire fiercely at the fleeing enemy cars. The enemy failed to break through to the south and turned to the west. The Volunteer Army warriors who had been ambushing there had already concentrated their fire on the enemy's tanks with the rocket launchers and recoilless guns they had just captured. After a fierce battle, three enemy tanks were destroyed and eleven were set on fire. At dusk, a large number of enemy tanks came from the direction of Hanxi (寒溪). The Volunteer Army warriors deliberately let the tanks pass, and then closely followed behind the tanks, cleverly using the enemy's tanks as cover to charge at the enemy. The enemy, who had been beaten to a pulp by the Volunteer Army during the day, was happy to hear that reinforcements had arrived, but unexpectedly the Volunteer Army warriors suddenly opened fire in the car group behind the tanks. At this time, the Volunteer Army troops from all directions besieged the disorganized enemy. Under the Volunteer Army's pincer attack, the enemy's tanks, armored vehicles, and cars collided with each other. A high ground on the enemy infantry's escape route was blocked by 魏汉福 (Wei Hanfu), a Communist Party member of the Volunteer Army, with a machine gun. More than a hundred enemies who had nowhere to go had to kneel down with their hands on their heads and surrender. Two companies of the 3rd Battalion of the US 23rd Regiment, as well as most of the 1st Battalion, were annihilated. The highway was filled with the enemy's destroyed tanks, cars, and piles of guns and artillery.

　　共产党员在五月反击战中
    新华社记者阎吾、王玉章
    在五月里照阳江南岸痛歼美军第二师第三十八团和二十三团的战斗中，中国人民志愿军里的中国共产党党员们，带领着非党战友们，以连续四十多次的强行攻击，一直打进敌人的心脏里去，歼灭了敌人。
    美军第三十八团在其所据守的加里山上筑了许多碉堡和地堡，在阵地前架设了三道到五道的铁丝网，树上挂了拉雷，地下埋了装有照明弹的踏雷。敌人还用成吨的炸弹、炮弹日夜不停地轰击照阳江和加里山之间的四十里宽的地带。敌人把这一火网区叫做“生物不能生存区”。可是英勇的中国人民志愿军却就从这个火网区杀上了加里山。而带头开辟胜利道路的是中国共产党的党员们。志愿军某部一连的共产党员工兵班长蔺有土首先用炸药将铁丝网炸开了缺口。他叫喊着：“同志们：从这个缺口冲上去吧！”勇士们涌过缺口，避开地雷，借着敌人打出的照明弹的亮光，攀上悬崖，夺取了敌人地堡中的机枪，掩护从正面攻击的战友前进。
    另一路向山头攻击的部队在破坏了敌人几道铁丝网以后，冒着敌人密集火力冲入敌阵。第一个冲入敌阵的是共产党员田际法，他一只手按住负了伤的肚子，一只手拿着自动枪不停地射击。在他后面的战友们随着也突入敌阵，和敌人展开了面对面的厮杀。
    志愿军勇士们在攻占加里山主峰后，一路直扑美军第三十八团团部所在地加里山南口大水洞。共产党员们在战斗中表现了无比的英勇。九连共产党员田学孔两手两脚四处负伤，仍然不下火线。三连四班共产党员白美堂在班长牺牲后，自动代理班长指挥作战，接连打下了三个地堡，俘敌二十多人。三连一排共产党员张三孔挺身出来代理排长。他带着战友打垮了比自己人数多几十倍的敌人的反扑。美军第三十八团虽然拚死顽抗，但仍然没有逃脱大部被歼的命运。
    在加里山战斗正在激烈进行时，志愿军乘胜分兵一支向敌人纵深杀去，迅速冲垮了挡在洪川到杨口公路两侧的法国营，并将美军第二十三团拦腰截断。敌人组织了坦克和装甲车发起反扑，企图夺路逃命。这时志愿军里的共产党员们就站到最前沿去迎击敌人。爆破组长共产党员张则云冒着敌人坦克的密集炮火，冲上去炸毁了第一辆坦克。接着他又冲进滚滚浓烟里去猛炸坦克后面的敌人的装甲车和汽车。守在路口侧翼的机枪射手共产党员魏海荣放过敌人坦克，猛扫坦克后面的敌人的汽车群。敌人坦克的炮火密集地向他射击，他的工事被打坏了，人被埋在土里。他爬出来以后，继续向逃跑的敌人汽车猛烈射击。敌人向南突围不成，掉转头来向西窜。早就埋伏在那里的志愿军勇士们用才缴获来的火箭筒和无后座力炮集中火力打敌人坦克。一场恶战以后，敌人的坦克三辆被击毁，十一辆被打得起了火。黄昏时，敌人又从寒溪方向开来了大队坦克，志愿军勇士们故意放坦克过去，自己就紧跟在坦克后面，巧妙地以敌人的坦克作掩护，向敌人冲锋。白天里被志愿军打得落花流水的敌人，听说援兵到来，正在高兴，不料志愿军勇士们却突然在坦克后面的汽车群中杀开了。这时志愿军各路部队从四面八方围攻被打乱了的敌人。在志愿军里外夹击之下，敌人的坦克、装甲车、汽车都自相冲撞。敌人步兵逃路上的一个高地又被志愿军的共产党员魏汉福用一挺机枪封锁住。走头无路的一百多敌人只得双手抱着头跪下投降了。美军第二十三团三营的两个连，还有一营的大部，都被歼灭了。公路上摆满了被打坏了的敌人的坦克、汽车和堆积如山的枪支、大炮。
