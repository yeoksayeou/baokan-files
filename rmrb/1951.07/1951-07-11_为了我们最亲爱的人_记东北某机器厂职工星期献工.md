　　For Our Dearest People
    ——A Record of a Sunday of Voluntary Labor by Workers of a Machinery Factory in Northeast China

    June 17th was the first day the workers of a machinery factory in Northeast China began their Sunday of voluntary labor.

    “Valiantly, with high spirits, we stride into the factory; produce more, buy airplanes, to protect our homeland…” Even though there was still an hour before work started, workers began entering the factory gate from 6:00 AM, singing their self-adapted songs. Zhang Zhaobi, who lived far away, told his wife on Saturday night to cook rice at 4:30 AM. That day, he also arrived an hour early, busy wiping down the lathes, oiling them, and organizing the tools. Many of the factory's machines were running before 6:30 AM. Veteran workers Liang Runzhi and Liu Hongli, who lived in the suburbs, rushed to catch the first tram in the morning, but it was too crowded and they missed it, arriving five minutes late. They said, "We must work harder in production to make up for the loss of these five minutes!"

    The workers considered increasing production for donation to be more important than anything else. Ma Qiyun's mother asked him to go home to prepare for his wedding, but he decided not to go. He said, "Personal marriage is a small matter; donating planes to resist America and aid Korea is a big deal!" Li Maolun, a foundry worker, had already taken leave to go home for a visit, but upon hearing about the voluntary labor, he refused to leave.

    In the workshops plastered with militant slogans, workers were putting into practice their proposed slogans: "Producing one more master machine is equivalent to producing one more airplane; producing one more screw is equivalent to producing one more bullet." They said, "For our dearest people, voluntary labor should be as energetic as the Volunteers fighting the American devils."

    Many of the factory's cadres were promoted from the ranks of skilled workers, and they were all "both civil and military." Hearing about increasing production to donate airplanes and cannons, they immediately organized production shock brigades and used their spare time to participate in production. They proposed to complete the assembly of six eight-foot lathes and the trial assembly of two ten-foot lathes by the end of June, and donate all their wages to buy airplanes. Zhang Zhengbang, the security section chief who came from a fitter background, had not worked for four years, but he did quite well with a file that day. Li Zhimin, the director of the foundry, finished a day's administrative work in the morning and went down to the factory in the afternoon to work. Even the factory director and deputy director came to help oil, scrape sand, and deburr… Technical personnel and staff who had no work automatically carried soil, dug mud, and renovated the factory environment.

    That day, the workers' output increased significantly compared to usual. Wang Maotang made small frames for textile machines, increasing from fifty boxes to seventy boxes. Jiang Fuxing made chucks for four-foot lathes, previously making nine a day, but completing them in just five hours that day. Dou Yutang also increased his production of ring gears from fifteen to twenty-two per day. The entire workshop of the West Foundry completed its eight-hour task in just six hours!

### 为了我们最亲爱的人  ——记东北某机器厂职工星期献工

　　为了我们最亲爱的人
    ——记东北某机器厂职工星期献工
    六月十七日，是东北某机器厂职工开始星期献工的第一天。
    “雄赳赳，气昂昂，大步进工厂；多生产，买飞机，就是保家乡。……”离上工的时间还差一小时，工人们从六点钟起就唱着自己改编的歌子，陆续进入工厂大门。路远的张兆弼星期六晚上就嘱咐他老婆在四点半钟煮好饭。这天，他也提前一个钟头上了工，在那里忙着抹车床子，浇油和收拾工具。全厂的好些机器，六点半以前就都开动了。住在市郊的老工人梁润芝、刘洪礼等一大早去赶第一班电车，因为人多没有挤上，迟到了五分钟。他们说：“咱得在生产上加把劲，补救这五分钟的损失！”
    工人们把增产捐献看得比什么都重要。马起云的母亲叫他回家准备结婚，但他决定不走，他说：“个人结婚是小事，捐献飞机抗美援朝才是大事！”翻砂场工人李茂伦已请好了假准备回家一趟，听说献工，也不肯走了。
    在贴满了战斗性的口号的车间里，工人们都在实践着自己提出的口号：“多生产一台母机，等于多生产一架飞机；多生产一颗螺丝，等于多生产一颗子弹。”他们说：“为了我们最亲爱的人，献工就应该象志愿军打美国鬼子一样地使劲。”
    这个厂的许多干部是从技术工人中提拔出来的，都是“文武全才”。他们听说增产捐献飞机大炮，也马上组织了生产突击队，利用工作的空隙来参加生产。他们提出要在六月底完成六台八英尺车床的装配任务，和两台十英尺车床的试作装配任务，将所得工资全部捐出买飞机。钳工出身的保卫科长张政邦，四年没有做工了，这天他拿起锉刀干得挺好。翻砂主任李植敏一上午做完了一天的行政工作，下午也下厂干起活来。连正副厂长也来帮助浇油，刮砂子，倒牙角……。技术人员和职员们没有工作的就自动抬土，挖泥，修整厂容。
    这一天，工人们的产量都比平常提高了许多。王茂堂做纺织机上的小架子，从五十箱增加到七十箱。姜福兴做四英尺车床的卡盘，过去一天干九个，这天只五小时就干完了。窦玉堂做牙轮也从一天十五个提高到二十二个。西翻砂场全车间八小时的任务，只用六小时就全部完成了！
