To correctly Carry Out Propaganda Work in the Cotton Selling and Storing Campaign
    —Discussing Several Problems in the Cotton Purchasing and Storing Work in the Nantong Prefecture of Northern Jiangsu
    Zhang Gan
    The cotton selling and storing campaign in some areas of the three major cotton-producing counties of Nantong, Qidong, and Rudong in the Nantong Prefecture of Northern Jiangsu has been initially launched since mid-last month and has achieved results. According to incomplete statistics, nearly one million jin of ginned cotton have been collected in the three counties by the end of June. However, there are still many problems in the campaign, and a mass movement has not yet been formed in most areas. The most important problem is:

  It is not acceptable to one-sidedly emphasize the immediate economic interests of farmers or to give empty political lectures.
    First, the political significance of patriotic cotton selling and storing has not been promoted completely and there are deviations. In most areas, district and township cadres often emphasize the economic interests of the masses in their propaganda and fail to mobilize and persuade the masses from a political perspective. They simply put forward slogans such as "Cotton stored in the bank earns interest" and "Cotton stored at home will be damaged by wind and rats and will be depleted," and emphasize the bank's "principal-protected and value-maintained" deposit regulations. As a result, the more the masses listen, the more they doubt: "Where does the government get so many benefits for us?" Although some areas have also promoted the reasons for selling and storing cotton, they are only abstractly promoting slogans such as "Factories lack raw materials, the country needs cotton" and "Selling cotton is loving the country," lacking specific and vivid content that is easy for the masses to accept. They are not good at inspiring farmers to recall the past and recognize that only under the leadership of the People's Government can production be increased and cotton have good sales and prices, so that cotton farmers can understand the truth of "protecting the country to become prosperous" from their actual lives. In areas where propaganda is biased, the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses for patriotic cotton selling and storing has not been raised, and the selfish and conservative farmer consciousness still prevails. For example, the instructor of Xinji Township in Haidong District has more than 100 jin of stored cotton at home, but he always denied having "even one jin of cotton" at the branch meeting. The village committee member of Xiazhakou Village in the same township runs far away whenever he hears about selling cotton, and does not even attend meetings. Generally, cadres are not confident and do not actively promote or take the lead in action.

  It cannot be allowed to distort the correct meaning of the worker-peasant alliance with narrow-minded peasant thinking.
    Second, narrow-minded peasant thinking is used to replace the idea of the worker-peasant alliance. Many areas have put forward wrong slogans in the propaganda and mobilization such as "Poor people all over the world are one family" and "We must help the working class brothers who are about to lose their jobs." Instead of proceeding from the interests of the people of the whole country, it should be explained that the shutdown of spinning mills will affect the supply of clothing for the military and civilians across the country, as well as the stability of prices. It should also explain the truth that "the working class is the leading class in the state power" and "industry leads agriculture."

  It is necessary to correctly publicize and explain relevant policies, and mobilization and investigation should not be carried out in a rigid manner.
    Third, the necessary publicity and explanation have not been given to the relevant policies. For example: (1) The policy of free lending. In areas with many lending disputes, the phenomenon of borrowing without repayment is relatively common, which is the main reason for the masses' fear of "revealing wealth." For example, Gu Bangneng, a middle peasant in Guangyun Township, Sanyu District, Nantong, borrowed 100 jin of cotton from Cao Yundao, a middle peasant, to buy land before the land reform. During the land reform, Gu's thinking was blocked because some of his rented land was extracted and adjusted, and the debt has not been repaid so far. Huang Zhengchang, a disabled soldier in Gong'an Township, borrowed seven and a half dou of corn from Zhang Yuanming, a middle peasant, last year and spent it on drinking in the street, and has not repaid it so far. When the lending policy was publicized, the masses reflected: "The policies of the higher-level government are good, but they don't work in our township." The local leaders did not deal with these complex lending disputes and impure elements in the cadres in a timely manner, and the concerns of the masses could not be eliminated. After the mobilization, it was discovered that a farmer in the township transported cotton out at night and sold it to private merchants, suffering a great loss. After selling it, he said: "It doesn't matter if I suffer a little loss, it's better than lending it to others." Other areas have the same phenomenon. This not only affects the development of this campaign, but also affects the enthusiasm of cotton farmers for production. (2) In the new areas, the masses are still worried about "being promoted to a higher class." (3) Because banking business has only begun to enter the countryside and has not yet generally aroused the trust of the masses, there is more or less fear that the bank is "unreliable." In addition, due to the rigid mobilization methods or the inappropriate investigation methods, a few cotton farmers mistakenly regarded the pre-purchase, sale and storage of cotton as "implementing socialism" and doubted that "socialism is coming soon." Because these doubts have not been eliminated in time, the phenomenon of selling more and reporting less, and selling far away instead of selling nearby is very common among cotton farmers, and the sale and storage of cotton has failed to form a mass movement.

    The key to effectively solving the above problems lies in leadership. Responsible cadres of party committees and governments at all levels in cotton-producing areas must personally take action, immediately organize forces, strengthen ideological leadership, improve the patriotic ideology of cadres and the masses, overcome the backward ideology of selfishness and conservatism, and correct certain wrong understandings among cadres and the masses, so as to rapidly develop the cotton selling and storing campaign.

　　售棉储棉运动中要正确地进行宣传工作
    —谈苏北南通专区购棉储棉工作中的几个问题
    张旰
    苏北南通专区主要产棉区南通、启东、如东三县部分地区的售棉储棉运动，自上月中旬以来，已有初步开展，并获得了成绩。据不完全的统计，至六月底三个县已收皮棉近百万斤。但运动中还存在不少问题，大部地区还没有造成群众性的运动。其中最主要的问题是：
  片面强调农民眼前经济利益和空洞的讲政治都是不行的
    第一、对爱国主义售棉储棉的政治意义宣传得不完整，有偏差。大部地区区、乡干部在宣传中往往强调群众经济利益的一面，没有从政治上去动员、说服群众，单纯提出“棉花存在银行里有利息”、“放在家里风吹、老鼠咬要蚀耗”等口号，强调银行“保本保值”存款条例。因此群众越听越怀疑：“政府这么多好处给我们，是那里来的？”不少地区虽也宣传了为什么要售储棉花的道理，但只是抽象的宣传“工厂少原料，国家要棉花”、“卖棉花就是爱国家”等口号，而缺乏具体生动的群众容易接受的内容。不善于启发农民回忆过去，认识只有在人民政府领导下才能增加生产，棉花才有好销路和好价钱，使棉农从实际生活中理解“保国才能发家”的真理。凡是宣传有偏差的地区，干部、群众中爱国售棉储棉的热情即未提高，自私保守的农民意识仍占着上风。如海东区新建乡指导员家有存棉百余斤，在支部大会上始终推说“一斤花也没有”。该乡小闸口村农会委员每当听到卖花的事情就跑得远远的，连会也不参加。一般干部都信心不高，也不积极宣传、带头行动。
  不能容许以狭隘的农民思想曲解工农联盟的正确的意义
    第二、以狭隘的农民思想代替工农联盟思想。不少地区在宣传动员中提出了“天下穷人是一家”、“工人兄弟要失业了，我们要救济他们”等错误口号。不是从全国人民利益出发，说明纱厂停工将会影响到全国军民衣着供应，及物价的稳定。说明“工人阶级是国家政权中的领导阶级”、“工业领导农业”的真理。
  要正确地宣传解释有关政策动员与调查不能用生硬方式
    第三、对有关的政策没有做必要的宣传、解释。比如：（一）自由借贷政策。在借贷纠纷较多的地区，有借无还的现象比较普遍，是造成群众怕“露富”的主要根源。如南通三余区广运乡中农顾邦能土地改革前借中农曹云道棉花一百斤买田，土地改革时顾因有部分佃田抽出调整，思想不通，债务至今未还。贡安乡荣军黄正昌去年借中农张远明玉米七斗半，上街喝酒，至今未还。当宣传借贷政策时，群众反映：“上级政府政策是好的，在我乡行不通。”当地领导上对这些复杂的借贷纠纷及干部中的不纯分子未及时处理，群众顾虑不能消除。动员后，该乡曾发现有一农户夜间把棉花运出卖给私商，吃亏很大，卖掉以后他却说：“吃点亏不要紧，总要比借给人家不还好得多。”其他地区亦同样有此现象存在。这不但影响着此次运动的开展，而且影响着棉农生产积极性的提高。（二）在新区群众中还存在着怕“升成份”的顾虑。（三）由于银行业务才开始下乡，尚未普遍引起群众的信仰，对银行或多或少的怕“靠不住”。此外，由于动员方式的生硬或调查方式的不适当，使少数棉农错误地把预购、售储棉花工作当作“实行社会主义”，疑虑“快社会主义了”。因为这些疑虑没有及时消除，棉农中卖多报少、近处不卖远处卖的现象很普遍，售棉储棉未能形成群众运动。
    有效解决以上问题的关键在于领导。棉区各级党委、政府负责干部必须亲自动手，立即组织力量，加强思想领导，提高干部群众爱国主义思想，克服自私保守的落后思想，纠正干部和群众中某些错误的认识，才能使售棉储棉运动迅速开展。
