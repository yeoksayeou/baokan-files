　　Learning from Chairman Mao's Marxist-Leninist Creative Style
　  (Written in Commemoration of the 24th Anniversary of "August 1st")
　　Chen Yi
　　When celebrating the Party's birthday, people first pay attention to understanding Chairman Mao's creative position in the Party's history. When commemorating the anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army, Chairman Mao's creativity in building the army should also be given primary consideration.
　　Marxism-Leninism, concerning military issues, refuted the reactionary ideas of all exploiting classes, such as armies being above politics, above the state, and above class. It argues that military affairs are a continuation of politics, and a people's army must be led by a proletarian party. A people's army is a tool for serving the people, while the army of the exploiting classes is a tool for serving the exploiting classes. There is a fundamental class distinction between the two. The army of the reactionary ruling class is the most important pillar of the reactionary ruling class. If the people's revolution cannot disintegrate and eliminate the army of the reactionary ruling class, there can be no revolutionary victory.
　　The Chinese people's revolution disintegrated and eliminated the counter-revolutionary army, and finally overthrew the counter-revolutionary dictatorship of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang. People's democratic dictatorship was realized throughout the country. This was achieved through the long-term struggle between the people's army and the counter-revolutionary army, with the people's army ultimately defeating the counter-revolutionary army. This is a characteristic of the Chinese revolution. Comrade Stalin pointed out in 1926: "In China, it is armed revolution against armed counter-revolution. This is one of the characteristics of the Chinese revolution and one of its advantages. The unique significance of the revolutionary army in China lies in this." The correctness of Comrade Stalin's statement has been fully proven by the long-term development of the Chinese revolution.
　　During the domestic revolutionary war of 1924-27, the Chinese Communist Party cooperated with the Kuomintang, which was still in revolution at that time, to create a revolutionary army. The independent creation of a completely people's army by the Chinese Communist Party began with the Nanchang Uprising on August 1, 1927. This was the response of the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary workers and peasants to the Kuomintang's rebellion against the revolution led by Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei. However, what ultimately enabled this uprising to succeed and become the initial starting point for the victory of the people's revolution was Chairman Mao's leadership of the worker-peasant armed forces in advancing to the Jinggang Mountains. The small part of the military strength preserved after the Nanchang Uprising only came to play its role in the long revolution after it merged with the armed forces and base areas directly led by Chairman Mao.
　　The creation of the Chinese People's Army is entirely credited to Chairman Mao's genius political and strategic thought of Marxism-Leninism.
　　It would be beneficial for us to recall how Chairman Mao solved the following major revolutionary problems in the early stage of the Second Domestic Revolutionary War.
　　First, I want to mention Chairman Mao's brilliant analysis of the political situation after the failure of the 1927 revolution.
　　At that time, Chairman Mao vehemently opposed both the capitulationism represented by Chen Duxiu and the "Left" leaning adventurism. Chairman Mao believed that although the revolution had suffered a setback due to the Kuomintang's betrayal, none of the contradictions that caused the great revolution from 1925 to 1927 had been resolved. The Kuomintang could not resolve these contradictions, and the Kuomintang's counter-revolutionary policy only promoted the deepening of these contradictions. Moreover, under the manipulation of various imperialist powers, the Kuomintang's rule would not be stable and would inevitably develop into a long-term warlord melee, which would give our Party and the Chinese people an opportunity to revive the revolutionary movement. On the other hand, Chairman Mao believed that the Party's ranks had suffered a great blow after the failure of the revolution, and the Party's policies should be re-examined and re-formulated. Based on this political analysis, Chairman Mao concluded that it was necessary to oppose "Left" leaning adventurism and right-leaning capitulationism, and to choose to develop guerrilla warfare in the rural areas of the border regions where the mass movement had a foundation during the Great Revolution, in order to resist the white terror and gradually accumulate strength to promote a nationwide revolutionary upsurge. I remember that from the winter of 1928 to the spring of 1929, Chairman Mao analyzed the political situation at that time and predicted that a new warlord melee would break out again. However, at that time, the Kuomintang warlords' encirclement and suppression of the Jinggang Mountains was intensifying, and there was no sign of withdrawal due to infighting. Many people inside and outside the Party doubted the argument that a warlord melee was bound to occur. Chairman Mao had to explain this issue almost constantly until the Chiang-Gui War broke out in the spring of 1929, which confirmed the correctness of Chairman Mao's argument. The accuracy of Marxism-Leninism's judgment on the development of the situation is the primary condition for gaining leadership over the masses. Chairman Mao was precisely a master at grasping this accuracy. Some comrades at that time believed that the Kuomintang warlord melee would not break out and advocated shrinking the guerrillas, and even believed that Comrades Mao Zedong and Zhu De should leave the team and go to large cities to do underground work. If this proposal were actually implemented, its impact on the entire revolutionary leadership during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War would be unimaginable.
　　What form would the Second Domestic Revolutionary War take? Some people were still pursuing the victory of the nationwide revolution through urban uprisings, while others were still fantasizing about a reappearance of the Northern Expedition. If the victory of the urban uprising was impossible and the Northern Expedition could not be repeated, then how long would the red flag of Jinggang Mountain last? What was the destination of the Jinggang Mountain struggle? This was the question of some comrades at that time. Based on the revolutionary experiences at home and abroad and the new conditions, Chairman Mao made a concrete analysis and put forward the policy of encircling the cities from the countryside and establishing rural base areas to advance to the whole country in a wave-like manner. Some comrades most looked forward to the so-called "daily expansion" and the rapid capture of large cities, and were afraid to talk about long-term arduous struggle. But what could be done? Under the conditions of the enemy being strong and we being weak at that time, even if one did not want to struggle for a long time, the fact was that the long-term struggle would continue to exist. In order to carry out a long-term war, it was necessary to choose a base area as the support for the struggle. When choosing a base area, Chairman Mao often emphasized that the local area was less affected by adventurism, that the foundation of the Party and the masses was still largely retained, that the terrain was very good, and that it was far away from large cities and the strength of the ruling class was relatively weak. Moreover, Chairman Mao personally led the team to make a tour-style selection. Chairman Mao first selected Jinggang Mountain as the base area, then selected nine counties and districts in southwestern Jiangxi as the second base area, and then merged the border areas of Fujian, Jiangxi, and Guangdong provinces to establish the central Red Army base area, raising the Second Domestic Revolutionary War from a local scope to a national scale. Later, he turned to northern Shaanxi and insisted on the northern Shaanxi base area as the base point for the anti-Japanese and anti-surrender struggle. In the recent People's Liberation War, Chairman Mao insisted on leading the national struggle in northern Shaanxi until he defeated the enemy before crossing the Yellow River eastward. Here we can see Chairman Mao's consistent emphasis on base areas and the tenacity of adhering to the base area struggle. The process of the Chinese revolution pointed out that the form of the Chinese revolutionary war could not be the way of urban uprisings first, nor could it be a repetition of the Northern Expedition, but rather a wave-like advancement of the rural base area struggle, so that the Chinese revolution could achieve victory in a long-term struggle. Chairman Mao believed that the idea of base area struggle was produced based on the following conditions: First, China was a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country that was invaded and divided by various imperialist powers; Second, the various factions of warlords in China were not unified internally under the manipulation of imperialism, and there was a long-term melee; Third, the socio-economic development of China was unbalanced, several economies coexisted, and no economic center dominating the whole country had been formed. Many areas economically retained a self-sufficient state, making the persistence of base area struggle economically difficult but possible; Fourth, China was a large country with vast land and abundant resources and a large population; Fifth, the long-term nature of the Chinese war and the Marxist-Leninist leadership of the Chinese Communists. Chairman Mao also often emphasized the great importance of the subjective condition of the Party's correct leadership. The idea of base area struggle is a unique strategic thought in China based on the above characteristics. Its main content lies in first establishing various small and large rural base areas, and establishing close ties with the broad masses of workers and peasants through correct land reform policies; in enabling various policies to obtain large and small-scale experiments; in allowing military preparations and long-term training; in making various preparations on organizational issues and cadre issues; in issuing revolutionary appeals to the people of the whole country, mobilizing and inspiring them to carry out revolutionary struggles, gradually strengthening the revolutionary forces, and striving to change the balance of power between the enemy and us; in enabling the Party to gain experience to enhance the Party's subjective mastery ability, so as to be able to smoothly cope with and lead major and minor events across the country. Our Party has the above-mentioned Mao Zedong-style scientific base area guiding ideology, thus breaking through numerous difficulties and leading the Chinese revolution to the final road to victory. Dogmatists look down on Chinese history, do not study Chinese history, cut off Chinese history, or fall into the mud pit of Chinese history and cannot climb out. Dogmatists, that is, "Left"-leaning adventurists, look down on the countryside. Moreover, they do not admit that the countryside can be the starting point for the victory of the Chinese revolution; when they hear Chairman Mao's proposal to establish rural base areas, if they do not call it conservatism, they call it a reflection of backward peasant consciousness. But the facts make us deeply realize the greatness of the strategic significance of Chairman Mao's early proposal of the base area idea.
　　Speaking of organizing and building the army, Chairman Mao insisted on the Party's political leadership over the army, insisted that the Party's branch be set up in the company, put forward the slogan that all work should go through the mouth of the branch, pointed out that the Nanchang Uprising troops did not build Party branches in the company, but put the branches in the regiment, which was a big mistake, so that the Party could not go deep into the masses to grasp the army. Chairman Mao advocated implementing the Party's leadership in every corner of the army, and opposed drawing out exceptional parts in the army that do not accept the Party's leadership; insisted that the class political boundary between the People's Army and the Kuomintang army, and insisted that the revolutionary political leadership and political work system are the lifeline of the People's Army; educated and persuaded the broad commanders and fighters that without the Party's leadership and political work, the People's Army would not be able to consolidate and improve its combat effectiveness. Chairman Mao advocated establishing a democratic system in the army to consolidate army discipline and combat effectiveness and strengthen the unity of officers and soldiers, declared that officers and soldiers are equal, abolished scolding and beating, abolished shooting deserters, and used metaphors such as the relationship between fish and water and flesh and blood to emphasize military-civilian cooperation. Chairman Mao advocated building a new-style People's Army with political work ability, mass work ability, discipline, culture, and combat effectiveness. Such an army was initially realized during the Jinggang Mountain struggle, and was based on Chairman Mao's personal research, inspection, and help in company work, using such in-depth and arduous political work to lay the foundation.
　　Speaking of the role and style of the Chinese People's Army, Chairman Mao put forward that the troops are the propagandists and organizers of the Party's policies. The military struggle of the troops should be good at combining with the struggle of the people's masses. Only by using the troops to participate in the land revolution and the worker-peasant movement can the troops be strengthened, the quality of the troops be improved, and the troops and the people be closely combined and share weal and woe. Chairman Mao pointed out: Any attempt to make the troops leave the mass movement, put forward a purely military viewpoint, and believe that the troops should do nothing else but fight is an extremely wrong military proposition. Believing his words will inevitably make the Red Army isolated and helpless and fail. Chairman Mao advocated a mass work style. Organize troop commanders and fighters to participate in mass work, participate in the mass work of a township and a village, conduct a specific investigation of the local political and economic situation of a township, a district, and a county, in order to obtain the necessary social knowledge as an aid to educate the troops and decide on the actions of the troops. In this way, the Chinese People's Army, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, is not only an armed army, but also an army of political propaganda.
　　Speaking of strategic and tactical issues: Chairman Mao advocated that the strategy and tactics of the People's Army should be based on a concrete analysis of the enemy and our situation in front of our army, and to carry out new construction and new creation. Chairman Mao hated the style of doing things based on subjectivity, making empty remarks, and not specifically analyzing the situation, and repeatedly ridiculed that scholars who use troops would inevitably fail. Chairman Mao, with the guiding principles of Marxism-Leninism, faced the military reality of the Chinese revolution and carried out great ideological creation, solving the most difficult revolutionary problem of how a weak Red Army could defeat a strong enemy. We recall that during the Jinggang Mountain struggle, Chairman Mao put forward the sixteen-character formula, put forward dividing troops to mobilize the masses, concentrating to deal with the enemy; put forward that guerrilla warfare should adopt a policy of wave-like advancement; put forward that the Red Army's strategy should be different in the period of internal rupture of the ruling class and the period of its relative stability, opposed dividing troops and advancing rashly, and opposed passive conservatism; put forward proactively influencing the situation, actively mobilizing the enemy, and avoiding fighting against a powerful enemy in unfavorable circumstances, while also advocating creating and seizing the enemy's weaknesses and giving the enemy a destructive blow, thus establishing the genius idea of annihilation warfare that maintains the vitality of our army, annihilates the enemy's vitality, and changes the balance of power between the enemy and us in continuous battles. Chairman Mao advocated choosing terrain, arranging the battlefield, and using the geographical conditions in our hands, combined with other favorable conditions, to achieve the annihilation of a superior enemy with our inferiority. Fully utilizing and giving full play to the various conditions and strengths of the People's Army, while avoiding the enemy's strengths and being good at attacking and utilizing the enemy's weaknesses, is the essence of Chairman Mao's revolutionary strategy. It is of course unimaginable to the average military strategist that these systematic scientific strategic and tactical propositions could be correctly put forward in the Jinggang Mountain era. The average military strategist can only talk about military affairs in terms of military affairs, and cannot see anything other than military affairs. Chairman Mao, from the beginning of grasping military issues, first regarded them as political issues, social issues, and people's revolution issues, and conducted concrete theoretical investigations, thus penetrating the essence and being able to carry out the creation of military thought. The average military strategist always only sees the issue of offense as the issue of offense, and cannot see other factors included in it. The issue of defense is always only the issue of defense, and similarly cannot see other factors included in it. However, when offense and defense, these two basic modes of warfare, fall into Chairman Mao's hands, new content and new perspectives are discovered. For example, retreat can be expressed as a completely defeated form in which form and content are consistent, and it can also be expressed as a victorious offensive form in which form and content are transformed from contradiction to unity, and retreat is used as advance. The former is a general war law familiar to general military strategists, and the latter is a special war law that goes beyond the usual scope and cannot be understood by general military strategists. Also, the average military strategist talks about strategy and tactics from abstract concepts. Those who can recite a few pages of war history are considered to be superior. Chairman Mao talks about strategy and tactics is how to enable the Chinese People's Army to defeat a strong enemy. This has concrete content, is fleshy, and is a strategy and tactics linked to long-term warfare. In this way, new experiences are naturally provided and new principles are created from solving new problems. Chairman Mao's military theory explains the special military laws of the Chinese revolution, starting with the Jinggang Mountain struggle. Chairman Mao's strategic and tactical guiding principles in Jinggang Mountain laid the foundation for more than 20 years of military struggle thereafter. The great generalization ability of Marxism-Leninism, which can foresee and foresee events, is once again proven here.
　　Chairman Mao also created typical examples of maintaining the main force of the army and saving the crisis in the leadership of the Jinggang Mountain struggle in the Xiang-Gan border area. Before August 1928, the Jinggang Mountain struggle in the Xiang-Gan border area was a situation of victorious development. Due to the rash advance of the main force of the Red Army into southern Hunan in August, it suffered a defeat. This was caused by the error of some comrades who violated Chairman Mao's instructions to persist in the Jinggang Mountain base area to cope with the enemy's encirclement and suppression, and rashly advanced into southern Hunan without any preparation. After the main force of the Red Army advanced to the south, Chairman Mao led a part of the Red Army to persist in the base area struggle, thwarting the enemy's attempt to seize the Jinggang Mountain base area; at the same time, he learned that the troops advancing to the south had suffered setbacks and were in great difficulty, so he decided to personally lead a battalion of troops to detour to southern Hunan to find the main force. Finally, it converged with the main force advancing to southern Hunan in the suburbs near Guidong County. The troops advancing to the south were in a state of disappointment. After Chairman Mao led the team to converge in person, the excitement and emotion of moving were difficult to describe in words. After the two units converged, Chairman Mao personally presided over the marching and camping and inspected the supply situation of the troops, and paid attention to the guidance of the local peasants' struggle. In this way, the main force of the troops was preserved, and the Jinggang Mountain struggle situation in the Xiang-Gan border area was also saved from the August failure. Through Chairman Mao's leadership, a very small situation was expanded, but obstacles were encountered in the middle, and due to the mistakes of some comrades, an expanded situation was ruined again. Chairman Mao had to fundamentally save this ruined situation with great perseverance and wisdom. This is another leadership example created by Chairman Mao in the Jinggang Mountain struggle. Chairman Mao not only maintained close contact with cadres and the people under general circumstances, but also maintained close contact with cadres and the people under extremely difficult circumstances. From the repeated tests of turning danger into safety and turning defeat into victory, the outstanding leadership ability of the leader and commander could not but be discovered, and the deep love of the Party and the people could not but be obtained.
　　Speaking of the persistence of the base area and the strategic transfer of anti-encirclement and suppression, Chairman Mao created an extremely outstanding leadership example in the decision to lead the action from Jinggang Mountain to southern Jiangxi. In the winter of 1928, the enemy carried out a larger-scale deployment to encircle and suppress Jinggang Mountain. In order to break the encirclement and suppression, Chairman Mao personally presided over the meeting to discuss the anti-encirclement and suppression policy, and repeatedly and exhaustively discussed in no less than dozens of meetings. For example, it analyzed the possibility of victory in anti-encirclement and suppression and the possibility of its failure; analyzed the favorable conditions for anti-encirclement and suppression and its unfavorable conditions; analyzed various possibilities of the main force repelling the enemy on the spot in Jinggang Mountain and mobilizing the enemy to advance into the enemy area to maintain the base area; put forward various advancing routes and various plans to resist the enemy's obstruction. Chairman Mao mobilized and deployed the troops staying in Jinggang Mountain. Chairman Mao's solution to the problem of maintaining the old base area and developing new base areas fully demonstrated his extremely responsible attitude towards the interests of the Party and the people. In addition to tightly grasping the main strategic issues, he also did not relax the investigation of every detail. Such a tight deployment and meticulous plan enabled him to lead the entire army to achieve the victory of anti-encirclement and suppression. As a result, it advanced into southwestern Jiangxi, expanded and created a new base area, and the Party and troops staying in the old base area of Jinggang Mountain were still able to persist after the anti-encirclement and suppression, becoming the basis for the large base area in the Xiang-Gan border area in the future.
　　The above points are only some of my personal recollections of the Nanchang Uprising to the Jinggang Mountain struggle era. These recollections are not only not comprehensive but also not very precise. For example, how Chairman Mao studied the land issue and put forward correct land policies; how to study the masses' immediate political and economic demands combined with the national political situation to formulate the struggle program of the people in the base area; how to preside over the Party's construction and oppose various biases within the Party; how to patiently educate cadres and comrades, etc., are all major revolutionary issues of a fundamental nature. Chairman Mao began to study and explore these issues and other important issues in the Jinggang Mountain struggle, and all had a glorious beginning. All of this is limited by space and cannot be covered one by one. Here, I only want to use some recollections that are biased towards the military aspect to illustrate the great creative role played by Chairman Mao in the transition between the First Domestic Revolutionary War and the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, as well as in the early stage of the Second Domestic Revolutionary War. During the Jinggang Mountain period, in the winter of 1928, when we were preparing for the Long March, we received the resolution of the Sixth National Congress of the Party. Chairman Mao led us to study the resolution of the "Sixth Congress", proving that the policies of Jinggang Mountain were basically consistent with the resolution of the "Sixth Congress". However, because Chairman Mao's leadership was based on the revolutionary practice of Jinggang Mountain, he naturally surpassed the resolution of the "Sixth Congress" on many issues and went deeper into practice to solve problems, which was also proven by the subsequent revolutionary war. I believe that Chairman Mao's creative spirit is based on the spirit of Marxism-Leninism in every place, and abides by the principles of Marxism-Leninism in every place, while never mechanically copying any ready-made conclusion or phrase of Marxism-Leninism to bind the hands and feet of revolutionary practice. Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin will not prepare us with strategies to solve all problems and let us enjoy their achievements in peace. Instead, they want us to follow the principles and instructions of Marxism-Leninism, delve into specific realities, and independently solve problems in order to realize the interests of the people. We must have the courage to think independently, the courage to solve problems independently, learn the revolutionary spirit of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and understand how to use historical materialism and materialist dialectics. We must go deep into reality, work with the masses in revolutionary practice, learn from the masses, be tempered in actual struggle, improve reality and transform reality, instead of sitting in the Big Five Wells and Small Five Wells on Jinggang Mountain, sitting in a well and looking at the sky. These are the words that Chairman Mao often used to publicize and educate people in the Jinggang Mountain era. Of course, during the Jinggang Mountain era, the Party's situation had not formed the dogmatism and narrow empiricism that emerged in the Party after 1930, but there was indeed a tendency within the Party to specialize in political gossip and not be practical at that time, and Chairman Mao's opposition to this tendency was very correct. Chairman Mao often said that if we advocate the land revolution, but have no interest in participating in the land revolution movement of a township, a district, or a county, then this advocacy of the land revolution is false. He also said that in the land revolution, those who verbally advocate attacking the rich peasants do not actually oppose the landlords in their actions. This is a pointed remark against verbal revolutionaries. Chairman Mao attached great importance to theory, and leading us to study the resolution of the "Sixth Congress" is an example.
　　As described above, the face of a creative Marxist-Leninist is vividly before us. Because Chairman Mao was proficient in Marxism-Leninism, he had the courage to carry out Marxist-Leninist creation, so starting from Marxism-Leninism, through the practice of the Chinese revolution, he closely combined the two to achieve the victory of the Chinese revolution, thus making the content of Marxism-Leninism richer and more developed. This is the most concrete and vivid dialectical development process of Marxist-Leninist thought, and it is the most worthy of our lifelong study.
　　The Chinese people are facing the economic construction of the new China after the nationwide victory, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army is facing the new national defense construction after the nationwide victory. In order to smoothly solve the economic construction and national defense construction of the new China, we can only start by learning Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought, and follow its principles and guidance to delve into reality and independently solve problems. Chairman Mao is full of creative examples in China's four great revolutions. Here, I will only cite the military creation in the Jinggang Mountain struggle as an example of my own study.

　　学习毛主席的马克思列宁主义的创造作风
　  （为纪念“八一”二十四周年而作）
　　陈毅
    在庆祝党的生日的时候，人们首先注意去认识毛主席在党史中的创造地位。在纪念人民解放军的建立的日子，毛主席在建军上的创造，同样是应该首先提出的。
    马克思列宁主义对军事问题，驳斥了从来各种剥削阶级所谓军队超政治、超国家、超阶级等反动思想，而认为军事是政治的继续，人民军队必须有无产阶级政党的领导。人民军队是为人民服务的工具，而剥削阶级的军队则是替剥削阶级服务的工具，两者是有其根本的阶级区别的。反动的统治阶级的军队是反动的统治阶级最主要的支柱，人民革命如不能瓦解和消灭反动的统治阶级的军队，就不能有什么革命的胜利。
    中国人民革命瓦解和消灭了反革命的军队，终于推翻了蒋介石国民党的反革命专政，而在全国范围内实现了人民民主专政，这是人民的军队和反革命的军队在长期的斗争中，人民的军队最后战胜了反革命的军队而达到的。这是中国革命的特点。斯大林同志在一九二六年曾经指出：“在中国，是武装的革命反对武装的反革命。这是中国革命的特点之一，也是中国革命的优点之一。革命军队在中国的独特的意义，也在乎此。”斯大林同志这个指出的正确性，完全由中国革命长期发展的过程所证明了。
    中国共产党在一九二四——二七年国内革命战争时期，是和当时还在革命中的国民党合作创建革命的军队的。中国共产党独立地创建完全的人民的军队，开始于一九二七年八月一日的南昌起义。这是中国共产党和革命工农对于蒋介石、汪精卫领导国民党叛变革命所给的答复，但是，使这个起义终于获得结果，并成为人民革命胜利的最初出发点的，乃是毛主席领导工农武装向井冈山的进军。南昌起义后所保存的一小部分军事力量，是在和毛主席所直接领导的武装及根据地汇合以后，才得发挥其在长期革命中的作用的。
    中国人民军队的创造，完全归功于毛主席的马克思列宁主义的天才政治思想和战略思想。
    我们现在来回忆一下毛主席在第二次国内革命战争初期是如何去解决下列重大的革命问题，是会有些益处的。
    首先我要说到毛主席对于一九二七年革命失败后的政治局势所作的英明分析。
    毛主席当时一方面激烈地反对陈独秀所代表的取消主义，另方面又积极地反对“左”倾盲动主义。毛主席认为：虽然革命由于国民党的叛变而遭受了失败，但是，引起一九二五年到一九二七年大革命的一切矛盾一个也未解决，国民党绝不能解决这些矛盾，国民党的反革命政策只是促进这些矛盾更加深刻化。而且在各帝国主义的操纵之下，国民党的统治不会稳定，一定要发展成为长期性的军阀混战，这就给我党和中国人民以复兴革命运动的机会。另方面，毛主席则认为：革命失败后党的队伍遭受了很大的打击，党的政策应该重新检讨，重新制定，根据这样的政治分析，毛主席得出了结论，指出必须反对“左”倾盲动主义和右倾取消主义，而选定在大革命有群众运动基础的边区农村开展游击战争，以抵抗白色恐怖，逐步积蓄力量，以促进全国革命高潮。记得在一九二八年冬到一九二九年春，毛主席分析当时的政治情况，预断新的军阀混战将要再起，可是那时国民党军阀围攻井冈山正在加紧，看不出有因内哄而退兵的痕迹，党内外有不少的人怀疑军阀混战必起的论点。毛主席差不多经常要为此问题作解释，直至一九二九年春蒋桂战争爆发，才证实了毛主席的论断正确。马克思列宁主义对于局势的发展的论断的准确性，是取得领导群众的首要条件，毛主席正是能掌握此种准确性的能手，当时有些同志的意见，认为国民党军阀混战不会爆发，主张缩小游击队，甚至认为毛泽东同志和朱德同志应离队到大城市作地下工作。此主张如真正实行起来，其对于第二次国内革命战争时期整个革命领导的影响将是难以设想的。
    第二次国内革命战争将采取何种形式？有人仍然追求以大城市暴动取得全国革命胜利，有人仍然幻想是北伐形式的再现。如果大都市暴动的胜利方式不可能和北伐形式不能再来的话，则井冈山的红旗打得久吗？井冈山斗争的归宿是什么呢？这是当时有些同志的疑问。毛主席根据国内外革命经验和新的条件进行具体分析，提出农村包围城市和建立农村根据地向全国作波浪式推进的方针。有的同志最盼望所谓“天天扩大”和很快的夺取大城市，怕谈长期的艰苦奋斗。但是有什么办法呢？在当时敌强我弱的条件之下，纵使不想长期奋斗，事实上长期奋斗仍继续存在下去。为了进行长期战争必须选择根据地作为斗争的依托。在选择根据地时毛主席每每着重当地受盲动主义影响较小，党与群众的基础保留尚多，而地势又很好，以及离大城市较远而统治阶级力量较薄弱的地方，而且毛主席还亲自带队作巡回式的选择。毛主席第一次选定井冈山作为根据地，以后又选定赣西南九个县区作为第二个根据地，以后又汇合闽、赣、粤三省边区建立中央红军根据地，把第二次国内革命战争由地方范围提到全国的规模，以后转到陕北，坚持陕北根据地作为反日、反投降斗争的基点。在最近人民解放战争中，毛主席坚持在陕北领导全国的斗争，直到打败敌军才东渡黄河。这里我们看出毛主席一贯的重视根据地，坚持根据地斗争的顽强性。中国革命的过程指出中国革命战争形式既不可能是大城市首先暴动的方式，也不可能是北伐形式的重复，而是采取农村根据地斗争的波浪式推进的方式，使中国革命在长期斗争中取得胜利。根据地的斗争思想，成为使中国革命取得胜利的思想，毛主席认为是根据下述条件而产生的：第一、中国是被各帝国主义侵略与分割的半殖民地半封建的国家；第二、中国各派军阀在帝国主义的操纵之下，内部不统一，存在着长期混战；第三、中国社会经济发展不平衡，几种经济并立，并未形成支配全国的经济中心，许多地区经济上保存自给自足状态，使根据地斗争在经济上的坚持虽然十分困苦但成为可能；第四、中国是一个地大物博人口众多的大国；第五、中国战争的长期性和中国共产党人的马克思列宁主义的领导。毛主席更经常着重地说明党的领导正确这个主观条件的极大重要性。根据地斗争思想是根据上述特点而产生的中国所特有的战略思想，其主要内容在于先建立各种小块大块农村根据地，通过正确的土地改革政策与广大工农群众取得密切联系；在于使各项政策取得大小规模的试验；在于让军事上作各种准备与进行长期的锻炼；在于在组织问题上、干部问题上能作各种准备；在于向全国人民发出革命的号召，动员和鼓舞他们进行革命斗争，逐步壮大革命力量，争取改变敌我力量对比；在于使党取得经验以增强党的主观掌握能力，以便能顺利地应付和领导全国的大小事变。我党有了如上所述的毛泽东式的科学的根据地指导思想，因而打破重重困难，带领中国革命到最后胜利之路。教条主义者看不起中国的历史，不研究中国的历史，切断中国历史，或者落在中国历史的泥坑中爬不起来。教条主义者也即“左”倾冒险主义者看不起农村。更不承认农村可以作为中国大革命胜利的起点；他们听见毛主席建立农村根据地的主张如不称之为保守主义，便称之为是落后的农民意识的反映。但事实使我们深刻地认识到毛主席很早就提出根据地思想的战略意义的伟大。
    讲到组织军队与建设军队，毛主席坚持党对于军队的政治领导，坚持党的支部设在连队，提出一切工作经过支部的口号，指出南昌起义部队不建设连的党的支部，而把支部放在团，是一个大的错误，以致使党不能深入群众去掌握军队。毛主席主张在部队中任何角落贯彻党的领导，反对在部队中划出不接受党的领导的除外部分；坚持人民军队与国民党军队的阶级的政治的界限，坚持革命的政治领导与政治工作制度是人民军队的生命线；教育与说服广大指战员，如果没有党的领导与政治工作，人民军队必不能巩固，不能提高其战斗力。毛主席主张在军队中建立为巩固军队纪律与战斗力，并加强官兵团结的民主制度，宣布官兵平等，废除打骂，废除枪毙逃兵以及用鱼水关系血肉联系等比喻来强调军民合作。毛主席主张建设一支有政治工作能力、有群众工作能力、有纪律、有文化、又有战斗力的新式的人民军队，这样的军队在井冈山斗争时期是初步实现了，而且是通过毛主席本人亲身研究、检查和帮助连队工作，以这样的深入而艰苦的政治工作去奠定基础的。
    讲到中国人民军队的作用及其作风问题，毛主席提出部队是党的政策的宣传者与组织者。部队的军事斗争应善于与人民群众的斗争相结合，只有使用部队去参加土地革命，去参加工农运动，才能使部队壮大，才能使部队质量提高，才能做到使部队与人民密切结合，而休戚相关。毛主席指出：任何企图使部队离开群众运动，提出单纯军事观点，认为部队除打仗外不应做别的事的主张，这是极其错误的军事主张，信他的话必使红军陷于孤立无援而失败。毛主席提倡一种群众工作作风。组织部队指战员参加群众工作，参加一个乡一个村的群众工作，对一个乡一个区一个县的地方政治、经济状况进行具体调查，以获得必具的社会知识，作为教育部队，决定部队行动的帮助。这样一来，中国人民军队隶属在毛主席领导之下，不仅是一支武装的军队，而且是一支政治宣传的军队。
    讲到战略战术问题：毛主席主张人民军队的战略、战术，要根据我军当面的敌我情况作具体分析，来进行新的建设与新的创造。毛主席痛恨凭主观办事、发空洞议论而不具体分析情况的作风，屡屡嘲笑书生用兵必败无疑。毛主席以马克思列宁主义的指导原则，面对中国革命的军事实际，进行了伟大的思想创造，解决了以弱小的红军而能战胜强大敌人的最困难的革命课题。我们回忆在井冈山斗争时期，毛主席提出十六字诀，提出分兵发动群众，集中对付敌人；提出游击战争应采取波浪式推进的政策；提出红军战略应分别统治阶级内部破裂时期与其内部相对稳定时期而有所不同，反对分兵冒进，反对被动保守；提出主动影响时局，主动调动敌人，以及在不利情况下避免与强大敌人作战，同时又主张制造和抓住敌人的弱点，予敌人以歼灭的打击，从而建立了保持我军有生力量，歼灭敌人有生力量，从不断战斗中改变敌我力量对比的天才的歼灭战思想。毛主席主张选择地形，布置战场，利用我方手中掌握的地利条件，配合其他有利条件，以达到以我们的劣势去歼灭优势的敌人。把人民军队的各种条件和力量充分利用，充分发挥，而避开敌人的长处，善于打击和利用敌人的弱点，是毛主席的革命战略的精髓。这些有系统的科学的战略、战术的主张，在井冈山时代即能够正确的提出，当然是为一般军事家所梦想不到的。一般军事家只能就军事言军事，除军事外看不到别的东西。毛主席一开始抓军事问题，就首先作为是政治问题，是社会问题，是人民革命问题，加以具体的理论的考察，这样就透入本质，而能进行军事思想的创造。一般军事家对进攻问题永远只是进攻问题，看不见其中包括别的因素，对防御问题永远只是防御问题，同样看不见其中包括别的因素，而进攻与防御这两个战争的基本方式，落在毛主席手上，便发现新的内容与新的角度。例如退却可以表现为形式与内容相一致的完全的败退形式，又可以表现为形式与内容从矛盾到统一的，以退为进的胜利的进攻形式。前者是一般战争规律为一般军事家所熟悉，后者是一种特殊的战争规律超出通常范围，是一般军事家所不能了解的。又如一般军事家谈战略、战术是从抽象的概念出发，其中能背诵几页战史便算高人一等。毛主席谈战略、战术是如何使中国人民军队能够打胜强大敌人，这是有具体内容的，连血带肉的，与长期战争相联系的战略战术，这样便自然而然地从解决新的问题中，提供新的经验和创造新的原则。毛主席的军事学说说明了中国革命的特殊军事规律，是以井冈山斗争为起点。毛主席在井冈山的战略战术的指导原则为尔后二十多年的军事斗争打下基础。马克思列宁主义的伟大概括能力，可以前知，可以预见事变，于此又得到证明。
    毛主席在井冈山斗争的领导上，也创造出保持军队主力与挽救危局的典型的例子。湘赣边区的井冈山斗争，在一九二八年八月以前是一个胜利的发展局面，由于八月红军主力向湘南冒进，以致遭受失败。这是一部分同志违背毛主席的坚持井冈山根据地以应付敌人围剿的指示，毫无准备地向湘南冒进的错误所造成的。毛主席于红军主力南进后，率一部红军坚持了根据地斗争，打破了敌人夺取井冈山根据地的企图；同时又获悉南进部队受挫，遭受极大困难，乃决计亲率一营兵力迂道往湘南寻找主力。终于与进军湘南的主力汇合于桂东县城近郊。南进部队于失利情况下，得到毛主席率队亲来汇合，其兴奋与感动的情绪是难以言词形容的。毛主席于两部汇合后，亲自主持行军宿营及检查部队的给养状况，并注意当地农民斗争的指导。这样，使主力部队得到保全，而湘赣边区的井冈山斗争局势也从八月失败中挽救过来。从一个极小的局势经过毛主席的领导把局面扩大，可是中间遇着障碍，由于部分同志的错误又把一个扩大的局势弄坏，又要由毛主席以极大的坚忍与明智，把这一弄坏的局势根本挽救过来。这就是毛主席在井冈山斗争中所创造的又一领导范例。毛主席不仅是在一般的情况下与干部、与人民保持密切联系，而且是在极艰苦的情况下与干部、与人民保持密切联系。从转危为安、转败为胜的屡次考验中，领袖与统帅的卓越领导能力不能不被发现，不能不取得党与人民的深切爱戴。
    讲到根据地的坚持与反围剿的战略转移问题，毛主席在领导从井冈山向赣南进军的行动决定上，更创造了极为卓越的领导范例。一九二八年冬敌方进行围剿井冈山的更大规模的部署。为了打破围剿，毛主席亲自主持会议讨论反围剿的方针问题，先后不下数十次会议作了反复而详尽的讨论。例如分析了反围剿的胜利可能性及其失败的可能性；分析了反围剿的有利条件及其不利的条件；分析了主力在井冈山就地退敌与向敌区进军调动敌人以保持根据地的各种可能；提出了各种进军路线，各种反对敌人阻击的计划。毛主席对留守井冈山的部队作了动员和部署。毛主席解决保持老根据地和发展新根据地问题，完全表现出他对党与人民的利益极其负责的态度，除对主要的战略问题紧紧掌握外，同时不放松每一细节的考察。这样的严密部署与精细打算，故能领导全军取得反围剿的胜利。其结果是进军赣西南，扩大和创造了新根据地，而留守井冈山老根据地的党与部队经过反围剿后仍能坚持下去，成为尔后湘赣边区大根据地的基础。
    上述几点仅系我个人参加南昌起义到井冈山斗争时代的一些回忆，这些回忆不仅不是全面的而且也不是很精密的。例如毛主席如何研究土地问题，提出正确的土地政策；如何研究群众的切身的政治、经济要求结合全国政治形势以制定根据地人民的斗争纲领问题；如何主持党的建设，反对党内各种偏向；如何耐心地教育干部与同志等，均是带根本性质的重大的革命问题，这些问题以及其他重要问题，毛主席在井冈山斗争中均着手研究与发掘，均有光辉的开始。这一切都限于篇幅不能一一涉及，我在这里只想以偏于军事方面的一些回忆来说明毛主席在第一次国内革命战争与第二次国内革命战争交替之间，以及第二次国内革命战争初期所起的伟大的创造作用，我们在井冈山时期，于一九二八年冬天正准备长征时，才收到党的六次大会的决议，毛主席领导我们对“六大”决议作了研究，证明了井冈山的政策与“六大”决议基本上是一致的。但因为毛主席的领导是以井冈山的革命实践为基础很自然地在许多问题上又超过“六大”决议而更深入实际地去解决问题，这又是为以后的革命战争所证明了的。我认为毛主席的创造精神，无一处不根据马克思列宁主义的精神，无一处不遵守马克思列宁主义的原则，同时又从来不是机械抄袭马克思列宁主义原来现成的任何一个结论和词句去束缚革命实践的手足。马、恩、列、斯不会把解决一切问题的方策都替我们准备的好好的，让我们安享其成，而是要我们依据马克思列宁主义的原则指示，钻入具体的实际，为实现人民利益去独立解决问题。要有独立思考问题的勇气，要有独立解决问题的勇气，要学习马、恩、列、斯的革命精神和懂得运用历史唯物主义和唯物辩证法。我们是要深入实际，在革命实际中与群众一道，向群众学习，在实际斗争中得到锻炼，提高实际并改造实际，而不是坐在井冈山上的大小五井，坐井观天，以上是毛主席在井冈山时代经常对人作宣传作教育时所说的话。当然，在井冈山时代，党内状况并未形成如一九三○年以后党内所产生的教条主义与狭隘经验主义，但当时党内确存在着一种专作政治游谈不切实际倾向，毛主席反对此种倾向是非常正确的。毛主席经常说，我们既主张土地革命，而又对一个乡、一个区、一个县的土地革命运动无参加的兴趣，则这种主张土地革命是假的。又说，在土地革命中口头主张进攻富农的人，实际上他们的行动并不反对地主。这是反对口头革命家的一针见血的话。毛主席对于理论非常重视，领导我们研究“六大”决议便是一个例子。
    如以上所述，一个创造的马克思列宁主义者的面貌便活跃在我们面前了。由于毛主席精通马克思列宁主义，便有勇气进行马克思列宁主义的创造，故从马克思列宁主义出发，通过中国革命实践，使两者紧密结合取得中国革命的胜利，因而使马克思列宁主义的内容更丰富更发展起来，这是最具体最生动的马克思列宁主义思想的辩证式的发展过程，这是最值得我们终身研究和学习的。
    中国人民面临全国胜利后的新中国的经济建设问题，中国人民解放军面临全国胜利后的国防新建设问题。要能顺利解决新中国的经济建设与国防建设，便只有从学习马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想去着手，根据其原则指导，钻入实际去独立解决问题。毛主席在中国四次大革命中充满了创造的范例。我在此仅举出井冈山斗争中的军事创造作为自己学习的一个举例。
