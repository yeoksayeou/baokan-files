　　All-France Peace Protection Congress Held Successfully
　　Calling on People to Strive for Cessation of the War of Aggression Against Korea and the War of Aggression Against Vietnam
　　More Than Five Million Five Hundred and Fifty Thousand People Have Signed the Peace Covenant Declaration
　　[Xinhua News Agency, 17th] Paris Dispatch: The National Peace Congress for the Defense of Peace, convened by the French National Peace Council, was held on the 15th at the "Mutualité" in Paris. More than three thousand representatives of working people from ninety provinces across the country participated in the congress; they also submitted signatures collected from various regions for the Peace Covenant Declaration to the National Peace Council.
　　The congress was opened by Professor Villar, an academician of the French Academy of Sciences. Mr. Fajon, Chairman of the National Peace Council, delivered a lengthy speech at the meeting. He vehemently denounced the French reactionary authorities for prohibiting the holding of the National Peace Congress and emphasized, "No force can prevent honest people from uniting to jointly defend peace." Fajon then pointed out that concluding a peace covenant among the five great powers is an effective way to ease the tense international situation and is closely related to the French and world people. Finally, Fajon called on all French people to unite and participate in the victorious struggle for peace. Casanova, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, Mr. Dumaine, Secretary of the General Confederation of Labor, the famous film director Autant-Lara, the father of the heroic peace fighter Henri Martin, and many others delivered speeches at the meeting. They unanimously pointed out that the enthusiasm of ordinary French people in the struggle for peace is growing day by day. They pledged to work even harder in the future to thwart the plans of the warmongers.
　　Amidst warm applause, the congress officially announced that as of the 15th, 5,558,400 people in France had signed the Peace Covenant Declaration.
　　Finally, the congress passed an open letter to the French people, calling on all honest French people to sign the Peace Covenant Declaration and to fight for the cessation of the Korean War and the Vietnamese colonial war. The congress concluded victoriously amidst the high tide of enthusiasm for the struggle for peace.
　　This congress was a great demonstration of the French peace forces. As early as April 15th, the French Peace Council decided to hold a national peace demonstration congress in Paris, with the participation of hundreds of thousands of representatives from all over the country. However, the Queuille government blatantly issued an order on June 27th prohibiting it. Under these circumstances, the French Peace Council announced that it would transform the traditional July 14th National Day demonstration into a great peace demonstration, and announced its determination to hold the National Peace Congress at the "Mutualité" in Paris as scheduled. The French people responded to the government's fascist measures with various protests and an expanded peace signature campaign. Protest rallies were held throughout the country, with participants including workers from the French General Confederation of Labor, as well as workers from the Catholic Labor League and "Workers' Force," as well as farmers and small property owners, who unanimously condemned the French government's shameless act of undermining the Republic's constitution. At the same time, the peace signature campaign developed at an astonishing rate. Before the French government's illegal ban was issued, only 1.5 million people in France had signed the Peace Covenant Declaration, but in the half-month after the ban was issued, more than 4 million people signed. Thus, the French reactionaries' plan to suppress the French peace movement ultimately failed, and the French people victoriously turned July 15th into a day of national unity for the struggle for peace.

　　全法保卫和平大会胜利举行
　  号召人民争取停止侵朝战争与侵越战争
　  五百五十余万人已在和平公约宣言上签名
    【新华社十七日讯】巴黎消息：法国全国和平理事会召集的保卫和平全国大会十五日在巴黎“团结宫”举行。参加大会的有全国九十个省劳动人民的三千多个代表；他们同时要把各地为和平公约宣言征集的签名递交全国和平理事会。
    大会由法国科学院院士维拉尔教授主持开幕。全国和平理事会主席法奇在会上发表长篇演说。他痛斥法国反动当局禁止举行全国和平大会，并且着重指出：“无论什么力量都无法阻止正直的人们团结起来共同捍卫和平。”法奇接着指出：缔结五大国和平公约是缓和紧张的国际局势的有效方法，是和法国及世界各国人民血肉相关的事情。最后，法奇号召全体法国人团结起来，参加争取和平的胜利斗争。法国共产党中央委员会政治局委员卡桑诺伐、总工会书记杜马、有名的电影导演奥丹—拉拉、英勇的和平战士亨利·马丁的父亲和许多其他的人，都在会上发表了演说。他们一致指出：法国普通人民为争取和平而斗争的积极性正在一天天增长。他们保证今后将更加努力，以挫败战争贩子的计划。
    在热烈的掌声中，大会正式宣布：截至十五日为止，法国已经有五百五十八万四千人在和平公约宣言上签了名。
    最后大会通过了告法国人民书，号召全体正直的法国人都在和平公约宣言上签名，并为争取停止朝鲜战争和越南殖民战争而斗争。在为和平而斗争的高涨热情中，大会胜利闭幕。
    这次大会是法国和平力量的一个伟大示威。早在四月十五日，法国和平理事会决定在巴黎举行有全国各地代表数十万人参加的全国保卫和平示威大会。但是葛义政府却于六月二十七日公然下令予以禁止。在这种情形下，法国和平理事会宣布把七月十四日传统的国庆日示威变成为伟大的和平示威，并宣布决心如期在巴黎“团结宫”举行全国保卫和平大会。法国人民以各种抗议的行动和扩大和平签名运动来答复政府的法西斯措施。全国各地都举行了抗议大会，参加抗议行动的，除法国总工会所属工人外，还有天主教劳工联盟和“工人力量”所属的工人们，而且也有农民和小资产阶级，他们一致痛斥法国政府破坏共和国宪法的无耻行为。与此同时，和平签名运动也以惊人的速度向前发展。在法国政府的非法禁令颁布以前，法国人民在和平公约宣言上签名的还只有一百五十万人，但在禁令颁布以后，不过半个多月，就有四百多万人签了名。这样，法国反动派妄想压杀法国和平运动的计划终归失败，法国人民胜利地把七月十五日变成了一个全国团结为和平而斗争的日子。
