  Cannot Rely Solely on the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company's Isolated Efforts
    The Tianmen County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government in Hubei Province only made general appeals and arrangements for cotton purchase and storage, issuing announcements and then paid little attention to the matter. The specific work was left to the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, and the county party secretary and most county committee members had little understanding of the cotton purchase and storage situation. The situation in the vast majority of counties in Hubei Province was the same. The county committee pushed the work to the government, and the government handed it over to the industry and commerce section. County and district cadres were all "busy" preparing for the land reform review work. District cadres especially emphasized the busy summer planting season and believed that cotton acquisition was solely the responsibility of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company. They did not assign cadres to cooperate or carry out political publicity and mobilization work. Provincial-level agencies were conducting closed-door rectification and examining cadres. The Provincial Finance and Economics Committee and the Commerce Department focused on holding financial and economic meetings to discuss plans for the second half of the year and next year but paid little attention to cotton purchase and storage. Other economic departments also did not pay attention to coordinating the supply of materials. Allowing the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company to fight alone in this way would make it difficult to complete the major political task of cotton purchase and storage.

  Beijing Workers and Shop Assistants Expose Tax Evasion
    In the popular and in-depth movement to Resist America and Aid Korea, people from all walks of life in Beijing have taken the initiative to assist the government in completing tax revenue tasks, and there have been many reports of tax evaders. According to preliminary statistics from the Sixth Tax Bureau of Beijing Municipality, from April to June of this year, a total of 263 reports of tax evasion and avoidance were received, with reporting methods including telephone notification, face-to-face reporting, and anonymous letters. With the assistance of the masses, the tax bureau uncovered a major case of unreported business volume amounting to 500-600 million yuan. Over the past three months, the Sixth Tax Bureau has verified and closed 201 cases based on anonymous reports, involving 304 instances of evaded business, income, stamp, provisional business, goods, and banquet taxes. In addition to rewarding informants in accordance with regulations to show encouragement, tax arrears and fines have reached more than 100 million yuan. These informants include shop employees, office cadres, night school teachers, students, and citizens, with shop employees accounting for two-thirds of all cases. The widespread reporting of tax evasion by shop employees fully demonstrates their patriotism and attitude as masters of the country, which is a very gratifying phenomenon.

  不能只要花纱布公司孤军作战
    湖北省天门县中共县委和人民政府，在购棉储棉工作中只是作了一般的号召和布置，出了布告，就不大关心这件事了。具体工作只是让花纱布公司做，县委书记和大部分县委委员对购棉储棉的情况很少了解。湖北省绝大多数县份的情况都是如此。县委推给政府，政府交给工商科；县区干部都为准备土地改革复查工作而“忙”，区干部特别强调夏种农忙，都认为收购棉花只是花纱布公司的事，不抽调干部配合，也不作政治宣传动员工作。省级机关在关门整风审查干部。省财政经济委员会，商业厅把开财经会议研讨下半年和明年计划作为工作重心，却很少管购棉储棉的事。其他经济部门也不注意配合供应物资。这样让花纱布公司孤军作战，无论如何是难以完成购棉储棉这一重大政治任务的。
  北京市职工店员检举漏税
    在普及深入抗美援朝运动中，北京市各界人民主动协助政府完成税收任务，检举漏税者已有多起。据北京市税务第六分局初步统计：自本年四月至六月，先后共收到检举漏税偷税情报二百六十三件，检举方式有电话通知、当面报告及投寄密报信等。在群众协助下，税局曾查获漏报营业额数达五、六亿元的巨案。三个月来税务六分局根据密报查实结案者，共计二百零一户，偷漏营业、所得、印花、临商、货物、筵席等税计三百零四件。除依章向检举人提奖以示鼓励外，补税及罚金已达一亿余元。这些检举人中有店员职工、机关干部、夜校教员、学生、市民等，其中店员职工检举者占全部案件的三分之二。广大店员职工检举漏税，充分发扬了爱国主义精神和国家主人翁的态度，这是非常可喜的现象。
