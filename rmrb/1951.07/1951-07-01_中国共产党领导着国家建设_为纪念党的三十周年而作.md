The Chinese Communist Party, after thirty years of struggle, led the Chinese people to victory in the revolution and, after the victory of the revolution, is now leading the construction of the country.

To examine the measures and progress of national construction in the new China over the past year and a half, one must first understand what old foundation this construction is being carried out on. That is, what kind of country was the old China on which the new China is built?

Our country is a country with a vast territory, rich products and resources, a population of 475 million, and a history of five thousand years. We are a great nation. However, for the past hundred years, our country has been in the following situation: First, it has suffered from imperialist aggression for more than a hundred years, and Japanese imperialism occupied the Northeast for fourteen years. Chinese feudalism and monopoly bureaucratic capitalism were tools for imperialism to rule the people, and the people were subjected to the oppression of these three for a long time; Second, due to imperialist aggression and the long-term rule of the reactionaries, China's economic situation is backward, with the total output value of modern industry accounting for only about 10 percent of the total national product. Although this figure comes from a rough estimation and may be revised somewhat after more approximate estimations or more precise calculations, it is certain that the proportion of modern industry is very small, and the proportion of agriculture and handicrafts is very large. Merely stating the proportion does not fully explain the seriousness of the situation. The serious situation lies in the fact that a large part of the small amount of modern industry is controlled by imperialism. The Northeast is China's primary heavy industry area, but the industry there was directly controlled by Japanese imperialism. Relying on armed aggression and economic aggression, imperialism directly and indirectly controlled many industries in China. On the other hand, China's agriculture and handicrafts account for a large proportion, and China is known as an agricultural country. In principle, agricultural products should be self-sufficient. But on the contrary, in the past, our country imported a large amount of grain and cotton every year; Third, our country has undergone twenty-five years of warlord wars and domestic revolutionary wars, followed by eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and four years of the People's Liberation War, which greatly damaged our economy. The year 1949 was a year of floods, and its total agricultural output was only 75 percent of the average level before the War of Resistance Against Japan. Industrial production in 1949 was even worse than agriculture compared to 1943, the peak year. The recent twelve years of war have greatly damaged the commercial relations of material exchange between urban and rural areas and between domestic and foreign countries. These are the outlines of old China. The Central People's Government led by the Chinese Communist Party is carrying out the construction of the new China on such an old foundation.

Since the establishment of the Central People's Government, in the past year and a half, the work done has been in the political, economic, and cultural aspects. The important tasks in the political field are as follows:

1.  Unified people's governments have been established from the central, provincial, municipal, and county levels down to the villages.
2.  Millions of routed soldiers, bandits, and Kuomintang remnants have been wiped out. The remaining few scattered bandits will soon be completely eliminated.
3.  Among the 400 million agricultural population, 290 million have implemented the reform of the land ownership system. Peasants have been allocated the landlords' land. Except for a few minority areas, land reform can be completed next year.
4.  Counter-revolutionaries such as secret agents, bandit leaders, and despots have been suppressed throughout the country. A large number have been arrested, and some have been sentenced to death. The counter-revolutionaries sentenced to death are those who, whether during the rule of the Northern Warlords, the rule of the Kuomintang, or the Japanese occupation, were able to ride on the backs of the people, poison the people, were heavily in debt for blood, and refused to repent and continued to sabotage during the era of the People's Government. Counter-revolutionaries sentenced to imprisonment will be reformed through labor.
5.  Since the US imperialists launched an attack on Korea and invaded our territory of Taiwan last June, a great patriotic movement has been launched among the people of our country. The people of our country have formed a volunteer army to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect their homes and defend the country. This movement has been carried out in all strata and regions of the country.

In the economic field, we have carried out the following important tasks:

1.  All factories, mines, railways, ships, and banks of Japanese imperialism and Kuomintang bureaucratic capital have been taken over, and these enterprises have been transformed into state-owned enterprises owned by the People's Republic of China. Relying on the masses of workers, uniting technicians and staff, the bureaucratic enterprises have been transformed into people's enterprises. Due to the improvement of the workers' political status and the state's concern for the welfare of employees, the enthusiasm of workers, technicians, and staff has greatly increased, and labor productivity has generally exceeded the standards of the Japanese and Kuomintang periods.
2.  The hyperinflation of the past twelve years has been curbed. The method is to unify the management of national financial and economic work, implement the management of all cash of state organs by the National Bank, rectify income, save expenses, and bring fiscal revenue and expenditure close to balance. Due to the curbing of inflation, state-owned trade has replaced speculators in the market's dominant position, and financial stability has greatly stabilized people's lives.
3.  Increase agricultural production. Due to the reform of the land system, the state implements a policy of supporting agriculture, the enthusiasm of farmers to produce has increased, and the weather conditions are generally normal. In 1950, China's total grain output increased by 14 percent compared to 1949, the year of floods. Taking the country as a whole, it has not yet recovered to pre-war output, but most of the old liberated areas have reached pre-war output. Although cotton production in 1950 was still lower than in 1936, the year with the highest output in Chinese history, it has exceeded the annual output of other pre-war years. As long as there are no disasters, China's cotton production this year will exceed 1936. The importance of increased grain and cotton production for our country is not only because China's agricultural economy accounts for a large proportion, but also because it has always relied on large imports of grain and cotton. In terms of grain, not only has the difficulty caused by the severe flood in 1949 been overcome, but this year it is possible to conclude an export contract of 516,000 tons with the Indian government to help the food-deficient people of neighboring India. The US imperialists are implementing an economic blockade and not allowing our people to exchange their own products for foreign cotton, but we are firmly convinced that we will fully supply the needs of the people with our own cotton, just as we handled the grain problem. The foreign exchange saved after grain and cotton are self-sufficient will greatly increase our ability to purchase industrial equipment.
4.  Promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and between domestic and foreign countries. In old China, farmers' commercial grain and industrial raw materials were the objects of price suppression by landlords, commercial usury capital, and imperialism. "A bumper harvest becomes a disaster" and "grain is cheap and hurts farmers" were the farmers' historical pain. Due to the People's Government's large-scale purchase of agricultural products at reasonable prices, the interests of farmers have been protected. Farmers' sideline products generally account for no less than 10 percent of the total annual income of farmers, so whether sideline products can be sold is a major event related to the lives of farmers, and the state assists farmers in selling them with great effort. The commercial ties between urban and rural areas and between domestic and foreign countries, which were stagnated by the twelve years of war, have been restored. In 1950, China's total foreign trade value exceeded any year after the September 18 Incident in 1931, when the Northeast was occupied, and it was the first surplus in seventy-three years. The customs autonomy longed for by the people since 1842 has been fully realized. Imperialists are blockading China's foreign trade, but the countries that account for the main proportion of China's foreign trade are no longer capitalist countries, but the Soviet Union and new democratic countries.
5.  Restoring state investment in the economy. The Central People's Government has not been established for two years, and the financial situation cannot have a large amount of state investment. Despite this, however, the total value of state economic investment, whether in 1950 or 1951, exceeded any year during the rule of the Kuomintang government. Our investment focuses on railways, water conservancy, and heavy industry. Except for 9 percent, all railways on the mainland have been repaired and opened to traffic, and new railways are under construction. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, for which the people of Sichuan have fought and bled for forty years without achieving their goal, has been completed for 130 kilometers. Chinese farmers have suffered from water and drought disasters. The total value of state investment and loans in farmland water conservancy in the past two years far exceeds the total value of all the money spent by the Kuomintang government in this area during the entire twenty-two years of its rule. The heavy industry sector is recovering. The economic investment of the Central People's Government in two years has given the people of the whole country a common feeling: only this government is a government that serves the people; only this government can lead the people of our country to happiness.

With the recovery of the national economy and the development of culture, the panic among students that "graduation means unemployment" no longer exists. There is no longer a surplus of graduating students above high school, but a shortage; the graduating students of universities and colleges are far lower than the needs of the economic, cultural, educational, and administrative departments, and the state can guarantee the jobs of every university graduate. As a result of land reform and the improvement of farmers' lives, the number of primary schools and adult literacy schools has also greatly increased. The schools and hospitals run by US imperialism in China under the guise of hypocrisy for the purpose of aggression have all been taken over by the state, and the subsidies from US imperialism have been rejected. At present, one of the tasks of China's cultural construction is to adapt to the needs of the country's future economic construction with a brand-new cultural construction plan.

The above are the outlines of the work in the political, economic, and cultural aspects of the new China in the past year and a half. These tasks are of great importance to the country, and they mark the great achievements of national construction. However, all of these are only the beginning of our national construction. The goal of the Chinese people's century-long struggle is to transform China, which has been insulted by imperialism, into an independent and prosperous China. Expelling imperialism from China and overthrowing the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang are only part of the struggle to achieve this goal. The full realization of this goal requires transforming an agricultural country into an industrial country, and the country must undergo a large-scale economic construction. The period of large-scale economic construction has not yet arrived, and is currently in the preparation stage. The work done in the past year and a half, such as consolidating the people's regime, reforming the land ownership system, restoring the national economy, and the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, are all, in a sense, preparing conditions for large-scale national economic construction. The preparation stage has not yet ended and will take some time. However, we will successfully complete the preparatory work and welcome the arrival of large-scale national planned economic construction.

        ×                         ×                      ×

The people of our country have unlimited confidence in economic construction. We have 475 million industrious people, our country contains countless resources, and the Chinese Communist Party, which has been tested for a long time, and Comrade Mao Zedong, who is rich in Marxist-Leninist wisdom, are leading our people to carry out economic construction. The people believe that, like the armed struggle to overthrow the imperialist Kuomintang reactionary rule, the economic construction work will also be carried out victoriously. At present, the living standards of the people of our country are low. But the people know that its source is due to a century of imperialist aggression, long-term reactionary rule and continuous wars. Imperialism and reactionary rule have stagnated and slowed the progress of China's economy for decades or even centuries. The people of our country will continue to work hard and redouble their efforts to fill this gap. Now our country has been unified, and there will be no more wars in the country. As long as we can guarantee world peace together with the peace-loving people of the world, in a few years, the economic development of our country will catch up with and later surpass the imperialist countries.

The ultimate goal of our country's development is socialism and communism, because only socialism and communism are the most perfect social systems for mankind, and the people of our country will strive to realize the socialist and communist social systems. But to reach the goal of socialism and communism, it is not possible to skip over, but must go through the current stage - the stage of new democracy. The nature of the regime in this stage: is the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class, based on the worker-peasant alliance, and uniting all democratic classes and all nationalities in the country. The economic structure of this stage: is the coexistence of five economies, namely the state-owned economy, the cooperative economy, the individual economy of farmers and handicraftsmen, the private capitalist economy, and the state capitalist economy, and the state-owned economy of a socialist nature is the leader. Due to special historical conditions, the current class relations and economic relations in our country need and can be handled in this way. Therefore, in the new democratic stage of our country, when implementing national economic construction, a new issue has been raised, that is: we must enable the five economies to exert their respective strengths, and must not conflict with but obey the overall plan for the main economic sectors of the country, public and private, formulated by the state. There is no doubt that due to the different enterprise ownership systems, uncoordination will inevitably occur. But two favorable conditions exist. First of all, our country is not only led by the working class in the political system of the people's democracy, but also led by the state-owned economy of a socialist nature in the economy. The progress of national economic construction will not weaken but greatly strengthen the state-owned economy. Therefore, we firmly believe that in the economy, as in politics, the state-owned economy of a socialist nature will have sufficient strength to lead other economies to coordinate their actions. Secondly, the private capitalist economy has felt and will continue to feel that under the new democratic regime, it is not subject to imperialist economic aggression, and the vastness of the domestic market is unprecedented. Their development opportunities are not reduced, but greatly increased, compared to the imperialist Kuomintang reactionary rule. Therefore, they also support this regime and, under appropriate conditions, can obey the state's economic plan.

The economic construction of our country must rely on the efforts of our own people. This of course does not mean that there is no need for foreign assistance in technology and other aspects. We do need this assistance, but this assistance cannot come from imperialism. Many working people and progressive people in imperialist countries sympathize with us, but it is the imperialists who decide the policies of their countries, and the imperialists hate us. Therefore, the Chinese people know that it is not others who can help China's economic construction, but the socialist Soviet Union and the fraternal countries of the new democracy. The two fronts of the world are very clear, and we stand on the side of the struggle for lasting peace and people's democracy. Our struggle to overthrow the imperialist and Kuomintang reactionary rule is part of this front's struggle, and national economic construction is a continuation of this struggle.

The Chinese Communist Party, the party of the Chinese proletariat with a history of thirty years, after twenty-eight and a half years of struggle, led the people of our country to overthrow the reactionary rule of the imperialist Kuomintang, and has been leading the national construction for a year and a half. National economic construction is a new task for us. We need to study hard, but we firmly believe that our party, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, will victoriously build our country, just like the armed struggle to overthrow the imperialist Kuomintang reactionary rule. In order to liberate themselves and build the country, the Chinese people have searched for all roads and tested all leadership groups for a hundred years. The Chinese people finally chose the Chinese Communist Party.

　　中国共产党领导着国家建设
    为纪念党的三十周年而作
    陈云
    中国共产党经过了三十年的奋斗，领导中国人民取得了革命的胜利，在革命胜利以后又领导着国家的建设。
    要考察新中国一年半以来国家建设的措施及其进展程度，首先必须明白这种建设是在什么旧基础上进行的？就是说，赖以建立新中国的旧中国是一个什么样的国家。
    我们的国家是一个这样的国家，国土广大，物产和蕴藏丰富，有四万万七千五百万人口，有五千年历史，我们是一个伟大的民族。但是近一百年来，我们国家处在这样一种境况中：第一、遭受帝国主义的侵略超过了一百年，日本帝国主义把东北侵占了十四年。中国的封建主义和垄断的官僚资本主义是帝国主义统治人民的工具，人民长期处在这三者的压迫之下；第二、由于帝国主义的侵略和反动派的长期统治，我国经济情况是落后的，新式工业的生产总值仅占全部国民生产总值的百分之十左右。这个数字，虽然来自一种粗略的推算和估计，在作了更近似的推算和估计或者在比较精确的计算之后，可能有若干修正，但是新式工业的比重很小，农业和手工业的比重很大，这是确定的。仅仅说明比重，还没有完全说明严重的情况，严重的情况在于：很少的新式工业中有很大的部分是被帝国主义控制的。东北是中国重工业的首要地区，但是那里的工业是日本帝国主义直接控制的。帝国主义依靠武装侵略和经济侵略，在中国直接间接地控制了许多工业。另一方面，中国的农业和手工业既占很大比重，中国又号称农业国，照理，农业生产品应该可以自给了。但是正相反。过去我国每年有大量粮食和棉花的入口；第三、我们国家经过了二十五年的军阀战争和国内革命战争以后，又经过了八年抗日战争和四年人民解放战争，使我国经济受到了很大的破坏。一九四九年是遭受水灾的年份，其农业总产量，仅达抗日战争以前的平均水平的百分之七十五。一九四九年工业生产如与最高年份的一九四三年比较，则比农业情况还要坏。最近的十二年战争，又把城乡、内外之间物资交流的商业关系，大大地破坏了。这些就是旧中国的概要。中国共产党领导的中央人民政府就在这样一个旧基础上进行新中国的建设。
       ×                   ×                        ×
    中央人民政府成立以来，一年半中，所做的工作，有政治方面，也有经济文化方面的。政治方面的工作，重要者是下列各项：
    一，自中央、省、市、县直到乡村，建立了统一的人民政府。
    二，剿灭了成百万溃兵土匪和国民党的残余武装，剩下的少数散匪，不久将全部肃清。
    三，在四万万农业人口中，有二万万九千万人口实行了土地所有制度的改革，农民分得了地主的土地，除一般少数民族地区外，明年可以全部完成土地改革。
    四，在全国范围内，镇压了特务、匪首、恶霸等反革命分子，逮捕了一大批，有一批被判处死刑；被判处死刑的反革命分子是一些：不论北洋军阀统治时代，国民党统治时代，日本占领时代都能骑在人民头上，毒害人民，血债累累，而又在人民政府时代拒不改悔、继续破坏的分子。判处徒刑的反革命分子将放在劳动中加以改造。
    五，自去年六月美国帝国主义进攻朝鲜、侵略我国领土台湾以来，在我国人民中掀起了伟大的爱国运动，我国人民组成了抗美援朝的志愿部队，在全国各个阶层、各个地区开展了抗美援朝保家卫国的运动。
    在经济方面我们进行了下列各项重要工作：
    一、接收了日本帝国主义和国民党官僚资本的一切工厂、矿山、铁路、轮船、银行，把这些企业变为中华人民共和国所有的国营企业。在国营企业中依靠工人群众，团结技师、职员，变官僚主义的企业为人民的企业。由于工人政治地位的提高，国家对于职工福利的关心，工人、技师、职员的劳动积极性大大提高了，劳动生产率一般地超过了日本和国民党时期的标准。
    二、制止了十二年来的恶性通货膨胀。其办法是：统一国家财政经济工作的管理，实行由国家银行管理国家机关的全部现金，整顿收入，节约支出，使财政收支接近平衡。由于制止了通货膨胀，国营贸易代替了投机商人在市场上的统治地位，金融稳定，这就大大地安定了人民生活。
    三、增加农业产量。由于土地制度的改革，国家实行扶持农业的政策，农民生产的积极性提高，气候条件一般的正常：一九五○年我国的粮食总产量比水灾年份的一九四九年提高了百分之十四。拿全国说，还未恢复战前产量，但是大部老解放区达到了战前产量。一九五○年棉花产量虽然还比一九三六年中国历史上仅有的产量最高的年份为低，但是已经超过了战前其他各年的年产量。只要没有灾害，今年我国棉花产量将超过一九三六年。粮棉增产对于我们国家的重要性，不但因为我国的农业经济比重大，而且因为历来依靠大量粮食棉花进口。在粮食方面，不但克服了一九四九年严重水灾而来的困难，而且今年度已有可能为援助邻国印度的缺粮人民，而与印度政府订立了五十一万六千吨的出口合同。美国帝国主义者实行经济封锁，不让我国人民以自己的生产品去交换外棉，但是我们确信无疑：我们将像处理粮食问题一样，以自己的棉花充分供应人民的需要。粮棉自给后所节省的外汇，将大大增加我们购置工业装备的能力。
    四、促进城乡内外物资交流。农民的商品粮食和工业原料在旧中国曾经是地主、商业高利贷资本和帝国主义实行压价收购的对象，“丰收成灾”、“谷贱伤农”，是中国农民历来的痛苦。由于人民政府以合理价格大量收买农产品，农民的利益得到了保护。农民的副业产品，一般地不低于农民全年总收入的百分之十，所以副产能否脱售，是有关农民生活的大事，国家以极大力量协助农民脱售。被十二年战争停滞的城乡、内外的商业联系已经恢复了。一九五○年我国的对外贸易总值超过了一九三一年九一八事变东北被占以后的任何一年，而且是七十三年来的第一次出超。一八四二年来人民渴望的海关自主，已经完全实现。帝国主义者正在封锁我国的对外贸易，但占我国对外贸易主要比重的国家，已经不是资本主义各国，而是苏联和新民主主义国家。
    五、恢复经济中的国家投资。中央人民政府成立未到两年，财政情况还不可能有大量的国家投资。虽然如此，但是，无论是一九五○年度的或是一九五一年度的国家经济投资的总值，超过了国民党政府统治时期的任何一年。我们投资的重点是铁路、水利和重工业。大陆上的铁路除百分之九以外都已修复通车，新的铁路已在修筑。四川人民四十年来流血奋斗未达目的的成渝铁路已经修通了一百三十公里。中国农民苦于水旱灾荒，两年来农田水利的国家投资和贷款的总值远远超过了国民党政府统治时期整整二十二年用在这一方面的全部总值。重工业部门正在恢复。中央人民政府两个年度的经济投资，使全国人民普遍地有了一种感觉：仅仅这个政府才是为人民服务的政府；只有这个政府才能领导我国人民走向幸福。
    随着国家经济的恢复和文化的发展，学生群众中那种“毕业就是失业”的恐慌，已不复存在。高中以上的毕业学生已经不是多余，而是不足；大学、专科的毕业学生，远远低于经济、文教、行政部门的需要，国家可以保证每个大学毕业生的职业。土地改革和农民生活改善的结果，小学和成人补习学校的数量也大大增加。美国帝国主义在伪善掩饰之下为了侵略而在中国所办的学校、医院，都已由国家接管，并拒绝了美帝国主义的津贴。目前我国文化建设的工作之一，是要以一种簇新的文化建设计划来适应国家今后经济建设的需要。
    上述各项，是新中国一年半来在政治、经济、文化各方面的工作概况。这些工作，对于国家具有极大的重要性，它标志着国家建设的巨大成就。但是，所有这些还只是我们国家建设的开始。我国人民百年来奋斗的目标，是要把被帝国主义侮辱的中国，变为独立、富强的中国。驱逐帝国主义出中国，推翻国民党反动统治，仅仅是实现这个目标的斗争的一部分。这个目标的全部实现，必须变农业国为工业国，国家必须经过一个巨大规模的经济建设。大规模经济建设时期还未到来，目前还处在准备阶段。过去一年半所做的工作，像巩固人民政权，改革土地所有制度，恢复国家经济，抗美援朝运动等等，在一定意义上说，统统是为大规模国家经济建设准备条件。准备阶段还未结束，还需相当时间。但是，我们将胜利地完成准备工作，迎接大规模的国家计划经济建设的到来。
        ×                         ×                      ×
    我国人民对于经济建设抱有无限的信心。我们有四万万七千五百万勤劳的人民，我们的国土内蕴藏着无数富源，领导我国人民进行经济建设的是久经考验的中国共产党，是富有马克思列宁主义的广大智慧的毛泽东同志。人民相信：像推翻帝国主义国民党反动统治的武装斗争一样，也将胜利地进行经济建设工作。目前我国人民的生活水准是低的。但是人民知道，其来源是由于百年来帝国主义的侵略、长期反动统治和连续不断的战争。帝国主义和反动统治使我国经济停滞和缓进了几十年，甚至上百年。我国人民将继续刻苦并加倍努力来填补这个空白。现在我们的国家已经统一，在国内再不会有战争了，只要我们能够和世界爱好和平的人民一道保障世界的和平，在若干年后，我们国家的经济发展将要赶上并在以后还要超过帝国主义国家。
    我们国家向前发展的最后目的是社会主义和共产主义，因为只有社会主义和共产主义才是人类最美满的社会制度，我国人民将为社会主义和共产主义社会制度的实现而努力奋斗。但是达到社会主义和共产主义的目的，不是跳过而必须走过目前的阶段——新民主主义的阶段。这个阶段的政权性质：是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础、团结各民主阶级和国内各民族的人民民主专政。这个阶段的经济结构：是国营经济、合作社经济、农民和手工业者的个体经济、私人资本主义经济和国家资本主义经济五种经济同时存在，而又以社会主义性质的国营经济为领导。由于特殊的历史条件，我国目前的阶级关系和经济关系需要而且也可能这样处理。因此，在我国新民主主义阶段，实行国家经济建设时，提出了一个新的课题，就是说：必须使五种经济发挥各自的力量，又必须不是抵触而是服从国家制定的全国公私主要经济部门的总计划。毫无疑问，由于企业所有制度的不同，不协调是必然会发生的。但是两个有利条件是存在的。首先，我们国家不仅在人民民主专政的政治制度上是以工人阶级为领导的，而且在经济上也是以社会主义性质的国营经济为领导的。国家经济建设的进展将不是削弱而是大大加强国营经济。因此，我们深信在经济上将与政治上一样，社会主义性质的国营经济将有充分的力量来领导其他经济协同动作。其次，私人资本主义经济已经感觉到还将继续感觉到，在新民主主义政权下，不受帝国主义的经济侵略，国内市场之广阔为前所未有，他们的发展机会，比之在帝国主义国民党反动统治时期，不是减少，而是大大增加。因此，他们也拥护这个政权，并在适当的条件下能够服从国家的经济计划。
    我们国家的经济建设，必须依靠我国人民自己的努力。这当然不是说不需要在技术和其他方面的国外协助，我们是需要这种协助的，可是这种协助，不能来自帝国主义。帝国主义国家的许多劳动人民和进步人士是同情我们的，但是决定他们国家政策的是帝国主义分子，帝国主义分子是仇视我们的。所以中国人民知道：能够援助我国经济建设的不是别人，乃是社会主义的苏联和新民主主义的兄弟国家。世界的两条阵线分得很清楚，我们站在为持久和平、人民民主而奋斗的一边。我们推翻帝国主义国民党反动统治的斗争，是这个阵线的斗争的一部分，国家经济建设又是这个斗争的继续。
    有三十年历史的中国无产阶级的政党—中国共产党，经过了二十八年半的奋斗，领导我国人民推翻了帝国主义国民党的反动统治，又领导着国家建设为时已经一年半。国家经济建设对我们来说是一项新的工作，我们需要努力学习，但是深信我们党在毛泽东同志领导下，将像推翻帝国主义国民党反动统治的武装斗争一样，胜利地建设我们的国家。中国人民为了解放自己、建设国家，在一百年中找遍了各条道路，考验了一切领导集团，中国人民是最后地选择了中国共产党的。
