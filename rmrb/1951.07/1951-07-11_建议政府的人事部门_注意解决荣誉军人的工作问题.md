　　Suggest that the Personnel Department of the Government
    Pay Attention to Solving the Employment Problems of Honored Veterans
    (Yang Li, Hebei Provincial Bureau of Honored Veterans) Comrade Editor:
    Currently, many revolutionary honored veterans are eagerly requesting to participate in national construction: For example, in Shijiazhuang Prefecture, an average of more than twenty honored veterans per day are requesting work from the government. Although they are physically disabled, they have a high degree of patriotism and a sense of responsibility. Seeing that the people across the country are stepping up production and work to resist America and aid Korea, they are eager to participate in appropriate work. Many organizations value this proactive request from honored veterans. When employing staff, they appropriately take care of honored veterans. For example, the Hebei Provincial People's Government Civil Affairs Department recently recruited five staff members, four of whom were second-class honored veterans. However, there are still many organizations and schools that are unwilling to hire honored veterans to work or study. They believe that honored veterans simply do not meet the "physically healthy" requirements. Of course, it is impossible to have honored veterans do work that requires good physical condition. However, we should recognize that honored veterans were injured and disabled in the struggle for the victory of the people's revolutionary cause. It is completely appropriate and necessary for us to provide appropriate care for the work and study of honored veterans. For example, honored veterans who have lost one or two legs but have cultural knowledge can be allowed to do printing, receiving and dispatching, accounting, or storage work. For honored veterans with lower levels of education, we can also find ways to organize them to participate in indoor light handicraft production. The Honored Veterans Printing Factory (printing and dyeing fabrics) established in Gaoyang County, Hebei Province, is a good way to absorb honored veterans into production.
    I suggest that the government's personnel department pay attention to the employment problems of honored veterans, meet the requirements of honored veterans to participate in work, and enable them to exert their strength in the construction of the new China.

　　建议政府的人事部门
    注意解决荣誉军人的工作问题
    （河北省荣誉军人管理局杨力）编辑同志：
    现在有很多革命荣誉军人迫切要求参加国家建设事业：如石家庄专区有的县就一天平均有二十多个荣誉军人向政府要求工作。他们虽然身体残废了，但是却有高度的爱国热情及责任感，他们看到全国人民都在加紧生产，加紧工作，抗美援朝，自己迫切要求能够参加适当的工作。有许多机关对荣誉军人这个积极性的要求是很重视的，他们在任用工作人员时适当地照顾了荣誉军人。如最近河北省人民政府民政厅吸收了五个工作人员，其中就有四个二等荣誉军人。可是，还有不少机关、学校不愿吸收荣誉军人参加工作或学习。他们认为荣誉军人实在太不合“体格健康”的条件了。当然，让荣誉军人去做必须具备良好身体条件的工作，是不可能的。但是，我们应该认识到，荣誉军人是为了争取人民革命事业的胜利而受伤残废的，我们对荣誉军人的工作和学习给予适当的照顾是完全应当而必要的。例如失掉一条腿或两条腿，而具备文化条件的荣誉军人，就可以让他们做些文印、收发、会计或保管等工作；对于文化较低的荣誉军人，也可以设法组织他们参加室内的轻便的手工业生产。河北省高阳县成立了荣誉军人印花厂（印制花布），就是吸收荣誉军人参加生产的好办法。
    我建议政府人事部门注意荣誉军人的工作问题，满足荣誉军人参加工作的要求，使他们能够在新中国的建设事业中发挥自己的力量。
