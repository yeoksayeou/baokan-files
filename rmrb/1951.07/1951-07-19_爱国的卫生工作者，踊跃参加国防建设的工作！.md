　　Patriotic health workers, enthusiastically participate in national defense construction!
    The State Council of the Central People's Government has today promulgated the "Decision on Enriching Health Personnel in National Defense Construction," calling on health personnel in national public health organizations and private practitioners across the country to enthusiastically participate in health work in national defense construction on a voluntary basis. All patriotic health workers should warmly respond to this call from the motherland, take up posts in national defense construction, serve the glorious People's Liberation Army, and serve the great national defense construction of the motherland.
    Health workers across the country have generally received patriotic education in the movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and they have shown unprecedented patriotic enthusiasm in the movement; health workers in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other cities across the country have spontaneously formed volunteer medical teams, surgical teams, and epidemic prevention teams to serve on the Korean front. In Nanjing alone, 1,605 people signed up at one time to participate in the Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea medical team. Health workers in various places established organizations such as the United Association for Practical Actions to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, donating or lending various medical equipment and medicines to the country, signing patriotic covenants, and increasing production to donate airplanes and artillery. These patriotic actions show that under the leadership of the Central People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party, the political consciousness of Chinese health workers has been unprecedentedly improved, which makes the implementation of the State Council's "Decision on Enriching Health Personnel in National Defense Construction" possible. Therefore, in order to implement this decision of the State Council, all localities should, on the existing patriotic political basis, launch a heated discussion on this decision among public and private health workers, so that everyone can deeply understand that health work in national defense construction is an indispensable part of building a modernized army, navy, and air force. From the perspective of health workers, guaranteeing the healthy life of all officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and improving the health level of commanders and combatants is the glorious task of patriotic health workers. As long as this idea can be grasped by the majority of health workers, they will consciously take up the glorious posts in national defense construction. Of course, there are some specific problems among health workers. Some people have livelihood concerns, and some people have learning requirements. Therefore, while carrying out political mobilization, the care measures stipulated in the State Council's decision for health workers participating in national defense construction in terms of salary, benefits, and advanced studies should be explained. After ideological mobilization and discussion, and under the principle of voluntarism, all localities can conduct registration in a guided manner.
    At present, China is extremely short of health workers. Based on one doctor per thousand people, the current number of doctors can only reach one-tenth of the required number. Therefore, after a group of health workers participate in national defense construction, all localities should pay close attention to continuing to strengthen social health care work. Under the current circumstances, the main method to solve this problem is to better utilize the role of existing manpower. First of all, private practitioners should be encouraged to participate in the work of public health organizations with all or part of their time according to the principle of voluntarism, helping and guiding them to serve social health work in a wider range. This can not only improve them politically and professionally, but also allow them to treat more patients, thereby achieving mutual benefit for both public and private parties. For private practitioners who cannot participate in national defense construction or public health organizations due to actual difficulties, local health administrative organs can, according to their willingness and needs, mobilize them to participate in joint public-private or private medical institutions. These joint medical institutions can conditionally solve some medical equipment and instruments that individuals cannot afford, exchange business experience with each other, help each other and benefit each other, and, where possible, implement specialized medical treatment, so that private practitioners can improve their business skills and specialize in their respective fields.
    Whether it is mobilizing public and private health workers to participate in national defense construction, encouraging private practitioners to participate in public health institutions, or organizing joint public-private or private medical institutions, governments at all levels, all democratic parties, all people's organizations, especially medical organizations and trade unions, should carry out in-depth mobilization, adhere to the principle of voluntarism, and avoid and prevent all possible tendencies of coercion and commandism. We believe that public and private health workers, who have undergone the great patriotic education of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and have shown unlimited love for the motherland in practical actions, will consciously and happily assume the glorious tasks given by the state.

　　爱国的卫生工作者，踊跃参加国防建设的工作！
    中央人民政府政务院已于今日公布了《关于充实国防建设中的卫生人员的决定》，号召全国公立卫生机关中的及私人开业的卫生人员在自愿的基础上踊跃参加国防建设中的卫生工作。一切爱国的卫生工作者都应当热烈地响应祖国这一号召，走上国防建设的岗位，为光荣的人民解放军服务，为伟大的祖国的国防建设服务。
    全国卫生工作者在抗美援朝运动中曾经普遍地受到了爱国主义教育，他们在运动中表现了空前的爱国热忱；北京、上海、天津及全国各城市的卫生工作者曾自动组成志愿赴朝医疗队、手术队、防疫队等组织到朝鲜前线服务，仅南京一地，一次报名参加抗美援朝医疗队的即达一千六百零五名；各地卫生工作者成立了抗美援朝实际行动联合会等组织，捐献或借给国家各种医疗器材、药品，订立爱国公约，增产捐献飞机大炮等。这些爱国举动表示：在中央人民政府和中国共产党领导下，中国卫生工作者的政治觉悟是空前地提高了，这就使政务院《关于充实国防建设中的卫生人员的决定》的实现成为可能。因此，为了实现政务院这个决定，各地应在已有的爱国主义的政治基础上，发动公私卫生工作人员对这一决定展开热烈讨论，使大家深切地懂得：国防建设中的卫生工作是建立现代化的陆海空军必不可少的组成部分，从卫生工作人员来说，保障人民解放军全体将士的健康生活，提高指挥员、战斗员的健康水平，是爱国的卫生工作者光荣的任务。只要这一个思想能够为广大卫生人员所掌握，他们就能自觉地走上国防建设的光荣岗位。当然，卫生工作人员中，是有些具体问题的，有些人有生活顾虑，有些人有学习要求，因此，在政治动员的同时，应解释政务院决定中对于参加国防建设的卫生工作人员在薪金待遇和进修深造等方面所规定的照顾办法。经过思想动员和讨论，在自愿原则下，各地即可以有领导地进行报名。
    现在中国的卫生工作人员是极端缺乏的，以每千人一个医生计，目前医生人数只能达到所需人数的十分之一，因此，在一批卫生工作人员参加国防建设后，各地应十分注意继续加强社会的保健工作。在目前的情况下，解决这一问题的主要方法就是更好地发挥现有人力的作用，首先要鼓励私人开业的卫生人员，按照自愿原则以全部或一部时间参加公立卫生机关工作，帮助和引导他们在更广大范围内服务社会卫生工作，这样既可以在政治上业务上更加提高他们，同时，也可以使他们多诊治一些病人，从而作到公私两利。对于因实际情况困难不能参加国防建设或公立卫生机关的私人开业的卫生人员，各地卫生行政机关可以按照他们的自愿与需要，动员他们参加公私联合的或私人联合的医疗机构。这种联合的医疗机构，可以有条件解决某些个人无法置备的医疗设备与器材，交流彼此业务经验，互助互利，并在可能条件下，实行分科医疗，使私人开业的卫生人员在业务上提高一步，作到各有所专。
    无论是动员公私卫生工作者参加国防建设的工作，或是鼓励私人开业的卫生人员参加公立卫生机构以及组织公私联合或私人联合的医疗机构，各级人民政府，各民主党派，各人民团体，尤其医学团体与工会，都应当进行深入的动员，坚持自愿原则，避免和防止一切可能发生的强迫命令倾向。我们相信，经过伟大的抗美援朝爱国教育的并在实际行动上表现了无限热爱祖国的公私卫生人员一定会自觉地愉快地担负起国家给予的光荣的任务。
