Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: TASS, New York: On June 29th, Security Council President Malik submitted a letter to the UN Secretariat addressed to each member of the United Nations Security Council, requesting it be distributed to representatives of all member states of the UN Security Council and published as a Security Council document. Malik's original letter is as follows:

"To the Members of the United Nations Security Council:

Despite repeated requests by the delegation of the World Peace Council to diplomatic and consular personnel of the United States stationed in several foreign countries for entry visas to the United States, in order to present the World Peace Council's letter to the United Nations Organization to the President of the United Nations Security Council in New York from June 25th to 27th, 1951, the United States government has not issued the aforementioned World Peace Council representatives entry visas.

The President of the Security Council telegraphed Mr. Austin, the head of the United States Delegation to the United Nations, on June 23rd, and later telegraphed Mr. Acheson, the United States Secretary of State, requesting him to quickly issue entry visas to members of the World Peace Council delegation. However, these two telegrams did not produce positive results and, in fact, were not answered.

Due to the lack of American visas, the twelve-person delegation of the World Peace Council was unable to come to New York to meet with the President of the United Nations Security Council. The attitude of the authorities of the host country of the United Nations Organization towards the visa applications of members of international organization delegations seeking to come to New York to meet with the President of the United Nations Security Council cannot be justified by any reason. This attitude blatantly violates the rights of the President of the Security Council and obstructs the President from properly performing his duties, because the President of the Security Council has been unable to receive the aforementioned delegation due to the refusal of American authorities to issue visas to the representatives of the World Peace Council. The President of the Security Council believes that it is necessary to make all of this known to the member states of the Security Council, and he himself protests the actions of the United States State Department, which obstruct the President of the United Nations Security Council from properly performing his duties, preventing him from receiving those who request to meet him to discuss issues of strengthening international peace and security.

The correspondence related to the issues described in this letter is included in the corresponding documents of the Security Council.

                                      Security Council President Malik
                                   June 29, 1951"

Xinhua News Agency, New York, 2nd: TASS, New York, June 2nd: Malik, President of the Security Council for June, sent a letter to the UN Secretariat on June 29th. The original letter is as follows:

The President of the Security Council has just received a letter from Robertson, a member of the delegation of the World Peace Council, stating: "The World Peace Council expresses its gratitude to you - the President of the United Nations Security Council - for receiving Mr. Robertson and Mr. Ufas, representatives of this council, on June 28th, giving them the opportunity to protest on behalf of this council against the actions of the United States State Department in refusing to issue entry visas to the representatives of this council delegation (whose purpose was to present the Peace Council's peace proposals to the United Nations).

"The World Peace Council will continue its efforts to ensure that members of its delegation can enter the United States so that various documents and proposals can be formally submitted to the United Nations as soon as possible. Further information regarding the denial of entry to representatives of the Peace Council will be sent shortly."

I request that this letter be published as a document of the Security Council so that all member states of the Security Council are aware.

                                     Security Council President Malik
                                        June 29, 1951

　　美拒发入境签证给和平理事会代表
    马立克函安理会各国
    抗议美侵犯安理会主席权利
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：六月二十九日，安全理事会主席马立克将致联合国安全理事会各理事国的信递交联合国秘书处，要求将这封信分发给联合国安全理事会所有理事国的代表，并把这封信作为安全理事会的文件公布。马立克的原信如下：
    “联合国安全理事会各理事国：
    尽管世界和平理事会代表团一再向美国驻在若干外国的外交人员及领事馆人员要求发给美国入境签证，以便于一九五一年六月二十五日至二十七日在纽约向联合国安全理事会主席递交世界和平理事会致联合国组织书，但是美国政府却不把入境签证发给上述世界和平理事会代表。
    安全理事会主席于六月二十三日致电美国驻联合国代表团团长奥斯汀先生，以后又致电美国国务卿艾奇逊先生，要求他迅速把入境签证发给世界和平理事会代表团团员。但是，这两封电报没有产生肯定的结果，而且事实上没有得到答复。
    由于没有得到美国的签证，世界和平理事会的十二人代表团就不能到纽约来会见联合国安全理事会主席。联合国组织东道国当局对待国际组织代表团团员申请到纽约来会见联合国安全理事会主席的签证的态度是不能用任何理由来辩解的。这种态度彰明较著地侵犯了安全理事会主席的权利，并阻挠了主席正常地履行他的职责，因为由于美国当局拒发签证给世界和平理事会的代表，安全理事会主席已不能接见上述代表团。安全理事会主席认为必须把这一切让安全理事会各理事国知道，他自己方面则抗议美国国务院的行为，这种行为阻挠了联合国安全理事会主席正常履行其职责，使他不能接见请求他接见的人士以讨论加强国际和平与安全问题。
    有关这封信中所说明的问题的来往函电，包括在安全理事会的相应文件中。
                                      安全理事会主席马立克
                                   一九五一年六月二十九日”
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社纽约二日讯：安全理事会六月份主席马立克于六月二十九日致函联合国秘书处。原函如下：
    安全理事会主席顷收到世界和平理事会代表团团员罗伯逊的一封信，内称：“世界和平理事会对你——联合国安全理事会主席表示感谢，因为你在六月二十八日接见了本理事会的代表罗伯逊先生及乌法斯先生，使他们有机会为本理事会对美国国务院拒绝发给本理事会代表团各代表（该团目的是要向联合国提出和平理事会的和平建议）以入境签证的行动提出抗议。
    “世界和平理事会将继续努力，争取其代表团团员能进入美国，以便早日正式向联合国提出各种文件和建议。关于和平理事会代表被拒绝入境的进一步的情况将随即送上。”
    我要求把这封信作为安全理事会的文件公布，以便安全理事会各理事国都能知道。
                                     安全理事会主席马立克
                                        一九五一年六月二十九日
