Comrades:

　　The existence of Japanese militarism has always been a serious threat to world peace. It carried out long-term and barbaric aggression against Asian countries, and hundreds of millions of people suffered its enslavement, bombing, burning, looting, rape, and massacre. In particular, the Korean people have endured decades of national subjugation, and the Chinese people have suffered fifty years of aggression. The people of Vietnam, Malaya, the Philippines, Burma, Indonesia, and Thailand have suffered its long-term devastation. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people waged a resolute, courageous, and selfless long-term struggle and an eight-year War of Resistance against Japan. The people of Vietnam, Burma, Malaya, the Philippines, Indonesia, and other countries waged arduous anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare, finally cooperating with the Soviet Red Army and British and American forces to completely defeat Japanese militarism. Because of the suffering they have endured in the past, the people of Asia have a bloody feud with Japanese militarism and want to completely eradicate it, establish a democratic Japan, and ensure peace in Asia and the world.

　　However, after the Second World War, the American imperialists violated the will of the peace-loving and liberation-seeking Asian people and attempted to replace and revive Japanese militarism to enslave the Asian people again. Following the defeat of the Japanese bandits, the American imperialists immediately launched aggression against China, supporting the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to slaughter millions of Chinese people. This conspiracy was completely shattered by the victory of the Chinese people. However, the American imperialists are still not reconciled to defeat. They have invaded our Taiwan, attacked Korea, and directed a group of lackeys and running dogs to suppress the liberation struggles of the Asian people. They are copying Tanaka Giichi's old path, attempting to swallow China and sweep the Pacific by invading Taiwan and Korea.

　　The Korean people, who have gained light and liberation, are standing on the front line of defending their country and defending world peace, resisting the American aggressor army. The victorious Chinese people, seeing the American troops approaching our Yalu River border and the flames of war burning at our doorstep, could not but rise up unanimously to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country, forming the People's Volunteers to fight alongside the Korean people, giving the aggressors a severe blow.

　　The American imperialists have not accepted the lessons of the series of failures of the Japanese bandits and themselves. Instead, they have intensified their efforts, betrayed all international agreements, and disregarded the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Asian countries. They are attempting to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan, to openly rearm Japan and revive Japanese militarism, so that they can expand their aggression under their direct command and provoke a new world war.

　　Comrades, Asian peace and world peace are facing a more serious threat! We must call on the workers of the world who defend peace, all kind men and women, especially the Asian worker brothers and sisters who have suffered the poison of the Japanese bandits for a long time, to unite as one and resolutely oppose the warmongering crimes of the American imperialists and take effective measures to stop them.

　　Therefore, I hereby submit the following report to the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions:

　　I. The American Conspiracy to Conclude a Separate Peace Treaty with Japan Will Be a Great Threat to Peace in Asia and the World.

　　Reviving Japanese militarism and rearming Japan, turning Japan into an American colony, and preparing for a war of aggression against Asian countries has been the consistent policy of the American government for the past five years. After the American occupation forces entered Japan, they abused their powers, completely violated the Potsdam Proclamation and the regulations of the Allied Control Council, arbitrarily released war criminals whose hands were stained with the blood of the Asian people, lifted the purge of militarist elements, suppressed the democratic movement of the Japanese people, supported Japanese reactionary forces, and secretly established Japanese military forces, and tried their best to delay the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan.

　　However, after the outbreak of the Korean War, the American aggressor army was defeated again and again by the Chinese and Korean People's Armies. Although the American aggressors were eager to expand the war of aggression, they have exposed the weakness of their long supply lines and insufficient manpower in Asia. Therefore, they believed that the scale of secretly arming Japan in the past was not enough to meet the needs of aggression. So, they changed their previous trick of delaying the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan and actively prepared to realize the separate conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, so as to openly and on a large scale rearm Japan. At the same time, the American government attempted to use this absurd method to end the state of war between the Allies and Japan, eliminate the name of the Allied occupation, and have the United States occupy it alone. It thought that this would allow it to achieve its predetermined goal as it pleases - to "legally" arm Japan on a large scale and without restriction, turning Japan into an American colony and a base for carrying out a war of aggression.

　　Chapter 8, Article 18 of the American government's "Draft Treaty of Peace with Japan" deliberately excludes the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other countries from the preparation of the peace treaty with Japan and is handled solely by the United States. This practice is a complete violation of international agreements. Because the Joint Declaration of the United Nations, signed by 26 countries including the United Kingdom, the United States, China, and the Soviet Union on January 1, 1942, clearly declared: "Each government undertakes to cooperate with the signatory governments of this declaration and not to conclude a separate armistice agreement or peace treaty with the enemy countries." The Potsdam Agreement of August 2, 1945, stipulates the establishment of a conference of foreign ministers of the five countries of the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, China, and France, and stipulates that the purpose of the establishment of the conference of foreign ministers is first for "the preparation of the peace treaty" and "in drafting each peace treaty, the conference will be composed of member states that signed the surrender terms of the relevant enemy country." The Allied peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland were all prepared and signed in accordance with the above provisions. Why should Japan be an exception and not follow the above provisions and be jointly prepared by the four countries of China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States, which signed the surrender terms in Japan?

　　We must point out that the preparation of the peace treaty with Japan without the participation of the Soviet Union and without the participation of the People's Republic of China is not allowed. Because: First, the Soviet Red Army finally defeated Japan. China has been subjected to the barbaric aggression of Japanese militarism for a long time since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894. It has carried out many years of heroic resistance against Japanese imperialism and suffered the greatest losses and disasters in history due to the aggression of Japanese imperialism. At the same time, the People's Republic of China is a large country in Asia with a population of 475 million and is deeply related to the Japanese issue. It is absolutely impossible to conclude a comprehensive and fair peace treaty with Japan that is beneficial to the people of Japan, China, and Asian and Australian countries without the participation of the People's Republic of China. Second, the future status of Japan and its peace treaty have no meaning without the participation of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. This peace treaty is of course illegal and therefore invalid. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has already formally declared this many times.

　　The content of the American government's "Draft Treaty of Peace with Japan" completely violates the clear provisions of the Cairo Declaration of 1943, the Potsdam Proclamation of 1945, and the Yalta Agreement on the issue of Japanese territory, the issue of Japanese democratization, and the issue of developing Japan's peaceful economy. On military issues, it particularly violates the above-mentioned international agreements.

　　Chapter 4, the security clause of the American government's "Draft Treaty of Peace with Japan" fully exposes the American attempt to use the separate conclusion of peace to achieve the evil purpose of openly "legally" rearming Japan without restriction, using Japan as a base, and using the Japanese people as cannon fodder, as a tool for the United States to continue and expand its aggression against Korea, China, and Asian countries. First, it does not have any guarantee to prevent the revival of Japanese militarism, nor does it place any restrictions on Japanese military strength. The Potsdam Proclamation clearly stipulated that the forces of Japanese militarism should be completely eliminated and that the revival of Japanese militarism should not be allowed. However, the American draft deliberately fails to provide guarantees for fulfilling this provision. In the peace treaty with Italy, which was also a major aggressor country in World War II along with Japan, the Allies clearly limited the number and quota of Italian land, sea, and air forces. However, the American draft does not place any restrictions on Japanese military strength. In this way, the American conspiracy to openly revive Japanese militarism is very obvious. Accordingly, the Japanese reactionaries can decide for themselves how much military power is needed to carry out so-called "self-defense," which is tantamount to an open approval of the revival of Japanese militarism and the rearmament of Japan. Second, according to the American draft, after the separate conclusion of the peace treaty, the United States will sign a "U.S.-Japan Security Agreement" with the Japanese reactionaries in the name of collective security, so that the American occupation forces will continue to be stationed in Japan for a long time and retain military bases. In this way, Japan will become an American colony and a military base for the United States to continue to expand its aggression against Korea, China, and Asian countries. This will be a great threat to peace in Asia and the world.

　　II. The United States Concludes a Separate Peace Treaty to Use the Japanese People as Cannon Fodder

　　A method of separate peace treaty with Japan like the United States not only completely violates international agreements and thoroughly damages the legitimate rights and interests of other Allies, but for Japan, it is also to make Japan a long-term American colony, and the Japanese people become slaves of American imperialism and become American cannon fodder.

　　According to the American draft, the American occupation forces will not withdraw after the conclusion of the peace treaty, and the Japanese base will continue to be occupied by the United States. In this way, the American army will still control the territory of Japan; the American air force will still be stationed in the densely packed airports in Japan and can fly back and forth; the American navy can freely use and enter and exit Japanese military ports and territorial waters. The United States completely controls Japan's national defense sovereignty and territory. The United States is also economically binding Japan layer by layer. In the past five years, the United States has controlled most of Japan's industries, and American capitalists have used the dissolution order of the Zaibatsu to cheaply purchase Japanese stocks. Now, the United States' forty trading companies and twelve shipping companies have completely controlled Japan's trade. Many of Japan's industries have become and are becoming American industries. In the future, after the peace treaty is signed, the United States will definitely sign a broad commercial treaty with Japan to protect the vested interests of the United States. The American draft treaty also stipulates that Japan must give the United States most-favored-nation treatment or national treatment. As a result, Japan cannot implement protective tariffs, nor can it control import and export trade. In this way, Japan cannot prevent the United States from further manipulating its economic life, nor can Japan develop peaceful and normal trade with other countries. After the American-made peace treaty is concluded, Japan will completely become the most humble colony of the United States. The Japanese people will become slaves of the American aggressors.

　　As mentioned above, this "Draft Treaty of Peace with Japan" permits Japan to rearm, and it is to rearm Japan with the help of the United States. Who is it armed for? Armed for the United States; what is the armed for? To fight for the United States and be cannon fodder. Under the leadership of Yoshida, the Japanese reactionaries, like Hitler, are using revenge psychology and vigorously arming Japanese aggressive forces under the command of the American occupation authorities. As a result, it will inevitably burn itself under American enslavement and cause the Japanese people to suffer the tragedy of war again. Past history has proved that the result of the Japanese imperialists' aggressive ambitions is only a dead end; even American imperialism has suffered a major defeat in the war of aggression against Korea, and it will eventually be defeated like the Japanese imperialists in the past. If Japan is harnessed to the American war chariot, it will only have a destructive future of being burned with the chariot. The first to suffer this sacrifice is the Japanese working people.

　　III. The Conclusion of a Separate Peace Treaty Endangers the Asian People

　　The American government's essence of aggression against Asian countries, whether it uses the name of "aid" or the excuse of "anti-communism," is becoming increasingly clear. The American government has taken a series of aggressive measures in Asia and carried out a series of aggressive activities. Copying the old path of the Japanese bandits, "To conquer Asia, one must first conquer China," it first concentrated its efforts on conquering China. However, its aggression in China failed. The People's Republic of China was established and has grown stronger. The American government has turned around and continued to step up its aggression against other Asian countries, attempting to turn Japan, Korea, Vietnam, and Thailand into American colonies and bases for attacking China and Asia. At the same time, it has strengthened economic and military "aid" to the Philippines, turning it into an aggressive base in the South Pacific. For other countries, the American government uses the so-called "Point Four Program" to achieve the purpose of economic, political, and military infiltration.

　　All these aggressive steps of the American government have developed into an armed war of aggression against Korea. The main purpose of the American government's aggression against Korea is to re-invade China and the whole of Asia after occupying Korea. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is a close neighbor of the People's Republic of China, separated from China only by the Yalu River. The American armed aggression against Korea directly threatens the security of the People's Republic of China, and the United States has occupied China's Taiwan Province and bombed China's northeastern border. Therefore, the Chinese people cannot ignore the serious situation of American aggression against Korea and the trend of expanding the war. All democratic parties, people's organizations, people from all walks of life, and overseas Chinese in China have successively protested against the American aggression and have been inspired by indignation and organized volunteer troops to aid Korea and resist American aggression.

　　After the American aggressors suffered heavy blows from the iron fists of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies in Korea, they actively prepared to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan in order to arm Japan on a large scale and without restriction, force the Japanese people to serve as their cannon fodder, and expand the war of aggression. Acheson had said as early as January 10, 1950: "The United States must support Japan and make it a major fortress in Asia against communism (i.e., aggression)." This further confirms that the American government's policy of concluding a separate peace treaty with Japan and rearming Japan will first and foremost be directed at Korea and China.

　　The Korean people have already suffered long-term enslavement and oppression by Japanese imperialism, and the United States has now begun to partially use Japanese manpower and material resources to invade Korea. It is truly an old hatred plus a new hatred. As for the Chinese people, they believe that Japanese imperialism is their most vicious enemy. Japanese imperialism has been invading China since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894. After occupying several provinces in Northeast China in 1931, it launched a full-scale armed invasion of China in 1937, causing great disasters to the Chinese people. The vast territory of China was ravaged by the iron hooves of the Japanese invaders, more than 10 million people died under the swords of the Japanese invaders, and more than 10,000 towns and villages were destroyed by the artillery fire of the Japanese invaders, with property losses of more than 50 billion US dollars. The Chinese people finally achieved victory in the War of Resistance against Japan after a difficult struggle. Therefore, the Korean and Chinese people cannot allow the American government to revive the forces of Japanese militarism.

　　The American government's policy of concluding a separate peace treaty with Japan and rearming Japan also endangers the interests of the people of Asian and Australian countries. During World War II, the people of Asian countries suffered cruel massacres and enslavement by the Japanese invaders. Vietnam, Burma, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaya were directly occupied by the Japanese invaders, and India, Ceylon, Australia, and New Zealand were threatened by the Japanese invaders. If the United States really revives Japanese militarism and the Japanese aggressive forces are rearmed, then the flames of a new war will be rekindled throughout the Far East, and the people of all countries will suffer new disasters again.

　　At present, the American government is trying to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan in order to openly "legally" rearm Japan on a large scale and without restriction. At the same time, it is variably recovering Japan's aggressive forces. The American occupation authorities have now armed 200,000 Japanese police officers, which is equivalent to the total number of Japanese regular troops in 1930. The United States has recently planned to establish a regular Japanese army of 450,000 people, as well as a navy with 500,000 tons of ships and an air force with 1,500 aircraft. The American occupation authorities are also actively restoring Japan's military industry. Many of the supplies used by the American troops invading Korea are produced by Japanese arms factories. By the end of May of this year, the number of general military orders accepted by Japanese industry from the United States was close to 300 million US dollars. Japan's airports and seaports have long become bases for the American troops invading Korea. Many of the planes bombing Korea and the northeastern border of China take off from Japan; the military supplies of the American troops invading Korea are either directly shipped from Japan or transferred from Japanese seaports.

　　Today, the American aggressors can use Japan's bases, manpower, and material resources to attack Korea; tomorrow, the American aggressors can use Japan's bases, manpower, and material resources to attack Asian countries. Therefore, the people of Asian and Australian countries must be vigilant and must take further concrete actions to oppose the illegal and criminal policy of the American government to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan and rearm Japan.

　　Contrary to the American government's draft treaty of peace with Japan is the "Opinion of the Soviet Government on the American Draft Treaty of Peace with Japan" submitted by the Soviet government on May 7. This opinion has been supported by the government and people of the People's Republic of China and has also been supported by the Japanese people and the people of other Asian countries. That is because the opinions put forward in this opinion are completely in line with the opinions of the People's Republic of China and are completely in line with the opinions and interests of the Japanese and Asian countries. Concluding a peace treaty with Japan based on the opinion of the Soviet government will truly end the state of war between Japan and the Allies, Japan and all countries can live in peace, Asian countries will no longer be threatened by Japanese aggression, and Japan will not be reduced to a long-term American colony and war base; Moreover, Japan's peaceful economy will be developed, mutually beneficial trade between Japan and various countries will be carried out smoothly, the Japanese people will be spared from being forced to serve as cannon fodder for American aggression, and they will live a peaceful and democratic life. Therefore, while opposing the American government's separate peace treaty, the people of all Asia must take active actions and strive for a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan based on the opinion of the Soviet government supported by the Chinese government.

　　IV. Further Develop the Struggle Against the American Separate Peace Treaty

　　The Asian people have already started the movement against the American government's separate peace treaty and rearming Japan. This is very necessary, and this movement should be further expanded and deepened. For the peace and security of the Far East, and for the happiness and benefit of mankind, all peace and democratic fighters must more resolutely and more bravely carry out the struggle against the American imperialists' separate peace treaty and arming Japan. We are convinced that as long as we take the correct steps and use all means to persist in the struggle, we will definitely be able to shatter the American imperialists' warmongering conspiracy.

　　So, how should the working class and peace-loving people of all countries carry out the struggle against the American separate peace treaty and rearming Japan? We believe that:

　　First, the working class of Asian countries must immediately launch a broad and in-depth movement among the vast people against the American separate peace treaty with Japan and rearming Japan, and strive to conclude a comprehensive and fair peace treaty with Japan based on the "Opinion of the Soviet Government on the American Draft Treaty of Peace with Japan" supported by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. The people of all countries can hold meetings, parades, and demonstrations, issue declarations, and publish books and periodicals to express their firm will to oppose the American separate peace treaty and rearming Japan and support the principles and suggestions in the "Opinion of the Soviet Government on the American Draft Treaty of Peace with Japan," and they can hold accusation meetings accusing the American and Japanese imperialists of their aggressive atrocities.

　　Second, unite the working class of Asian countries and call on all peace-loving people from all walks of life to form a broad peace and democratic front against American aggression, to oppose the American separate peace treaty with Japan and strive to conclude a comprehensive peace treaty. Workers and trade unions in Asian and Australian countries should actively support the World Peace Council's proposal to convene a broad conference of Asian and Australian people against American aggression and against arming Japan.

　　Third, the workers and peace-loving people of the world should support the war of resistance against aggression by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers and strive for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. Workers in all countries should oppose the production of munitions and the transportation of troops and supplies to Korea for aggression on the basis of the unity of all workers and with the support of the broad masses of people.

　　Fourth, the workers and peace-loving people of the world should support the Japanese people's struggle for peace, democracy, independence, and against the separate peace treaty and rearming Japan. To this end, the people of all countries should first write letters to Japanese trade unions, organizations, political parties, parliaments, and newspapers, telling them that the interests of the people of all countries are consistent with the interests of the Japanese people, and that the Japanese people should unite with the people of Asian countries to oppose the American reactionary policy toward Japan, oppose the Yoshida Shigeru government's collusion with the United States, sell out the interests of the Japanese people, allow the United States to occupy Japan for a long time, force the people to serve as cannon fodder, and turn Japan into an American colony and military base.

　　Fifth, the Japanese people should refuse to be cannon fodder, refuse to produce and transport munitions, and refuse to transport troops to Korea for aggression.

　　Sixth, workers and peace-loving and democratic people of all countries should take active actions to support the national liberation struggles of the oppressed people of Asian countries. The purpose of the American rearming of Japan is to use Japan to suppress the national liberation movements of the Asian people, so as to achieve the goal of dominating Asia and then dominating the world.

　　As long as we take action, we can stop and smash the American plan to conclude a separate peace treaty and rearm Japanese aggressive forces. Today, in Asia, opposing the American rearming of Japan has become an urgent task. This is not only related to the peace and security of Asia, but also to the peace and security of the world. Therefore, the working class and peace-loving and democratic people of all countries should actively participate in this struggle until victory is achieved.

专栏：

　　反对美国重新武装日本
    刘宁一在世界工联执行局会议上的报告同志们：
    日本军国主义的存在，历来就是世界和平的严重威胁，它曾对亚洲各国实行过长期的野蛮侵略，成千成万的人民遭受过它的奴役、轰炸、焚烧、抢掠、奸淫和屠杀。特别是朝鲜人民，曾度过几十年的亡国痛史，中国人民曾受过它五十年的侵略灾难。越南、马来亚、菲律滨、缅甸、印尼、泰国的人民遭受到它的长期蹂躏。中国人民在毛泽东主席领导之下，进行了坚决勇敢、不顾牺牲的长期斗争与八年抗日战争，越南、缅甸、马来亚、菲律滨、印度尼西亚等国人民进行了艰苦的抗日游击战争，终于配合苏联的红军和英美军队将日本军国主义完全击溃。亚洲人民由于过去所受的苦难，对日本军国主义是血海深仇，要彻底地加以根绝，建立民主的日本，确保亚洲与世界的和平。
    但是，在世界第二次大战后，美帝国主义者却违背了爱好和平、要求解放的亚洲人民的意志，竟企图代替与复活日本军国主义，再行奴役亚洲人民。继日寇失败之后，美帝国主义者即对中国进行侵略，支持蒋介石匪帮屠杀了几百万中国人民，这一阴谋已随着中国人民的胜利而被彻底粉碎了。但是美帝国主义者仍不甘于失败，它又侵占我国台湾，进攻朝鲜，并指使着一群喽啰走卒压迫亚洲各国人民的解放斗争。它抄袭了田中义一的旧路，企图从侵占台湾、朝鲜，鲸吞中国、席卷太平洋。
    已经获得光明和解放的朝鲜人民，站在保卫祖国保卫世界和平的前线，抗击美国侵略军。胜利了的中国人民，看到了美军逼近我鸭绿江边，战火烧到自己的门前，不能不一致奋起，抗美援朝，保家卫国，组成了人民志愿军与朝鲜人民并肩作战，给侵略者以严重的打击。
    美帝国主义者，并没有接受日寇和他们自己一连串的失败的教训，却更变本加厉，背叛一切国际协定，置苏联、中华人民共和国与亚洲各国于不顾，竟要与日本单独缔结和约，要公开重新武装日本、复活日本军国主义，以便在其直接指挥下来扩大侵略，挑动新的世界大战。
    同志们，亚洲和平与世界和平受到了更严重的威胁了！我们不能不号召全世界保卫和平的工人们、一切善良的男女们，特别是久经日寇荼毒的亚洲工人兄弟姊妹们，一致团结起来，坚决地反对美帝国主义者这种好战罪行，而采取有效的办法予以制止。
    因此我特向世界工会联合会执行局提出如下报告：
    一、美国单独缔结对日和约的阴谋，将是亚洲与世界和平的极大威胁
    复活日本军国主义及重新武装日本，变日本为美国殖民地，以准备侵略亚洲各国的战争，是美国政府五年来的一贯政策。美国占领军当局进驻日本后，就滥用职权，完全违反波茨坦公告及盟国管制委员会的规定，擅自释放双手沾满亚洲人民血迹的战争罪犯，解除对军国主义分子的整肃，镇压日本人民的民主运动，扶植日本反动势力，并秘密建立日本军事力量，极力拖延缔结全面对日和约。
    但是，在朝鲜战争发生后，美国侵略军被中朝人民军队打得一败再败。美国侵略者虽然急于想扩大侵略战争，但是在亚洲已暴露了它供应线过长，人力不足的弱点。因此，它对于过去秘密武装日本的规模，认为不足以满足侵略的需要，遂一变以往拖延缔结全面对日和约的诡计，转而积极准备实现单独缔结对日和约，借以公开地大规模地重新武装日本。同时，美国政府企图用这种荒谬办法，来结束盟国与日本之间的战争状态，消除盟国占领的名义，而由美国一国独自占领。它以为这样就可以为所欲为地实现其预定目的——“合法地”大规模无限制地武装日本，变日本为美国殖民地及进行侵略战争的基地。
    美国政府的《对日和约草案》第八章第十八条，蓄意排除苏联、中华人民共和国及其他国家于对日和约的准备工作之外，而由美国一手包办。这种作法是完全违反国际协议的。因为一九四二年一月一日英、美、中、苏等二十六个国家签字的联合国家共同宣言中曾明白宣布：“每一政府承允与本宣言签字国政府合作，并不与敌国缔结单独停战协定与和约。”一九四五年八月二日波茨坦协定中规定建立英、美、苏、中、法五国外长会议，并规定外长会议的建立目的首先是为了“和约的准备工作”，“在草拟各个和约时，会议将由在有关敌国投降条款上签字之会员国组成之”。盟国对意、罗、匈、保、芬五国的和约，都是根据上述规定准备与签订的。对日本又何能例外地不依照上述规定由在日本投降条款上签字的中、苏、英、美四国来共同准备呢？
    我们必须指出，对日和约的准备工作没有苏联参加，没有中华人民共和国参加，是不能允许的。因为：第一、苏联红军最后击溃了日本。中国自一八九四年中日战争以来，长期遭受日本军国主义的横蛮侵略，曾对日本帝国主义进行了多年的英勇抵抗，且因日本帝国主义的侵略而受到历史上最大的损失和灾难。同时，中华人民共和国是亚洲拥有四亿七千五百万人口的大国，与日本问题有深切的关系，要缔结一个有利于日本、中国及亚澳各国人民的全面的公正的对日和约，没有中华人民共和国的参加是决不可能的。第二、关于日本的未来地位及其和约如没有苏联和中华人民共和国的参加，是没有任何意义的。这个和约，也就当然是非法的，从而是无效的。这一点中华人民共和国中央人民政府早已迭次正式声明了。
    美国政府的《对日和约草案》的内容，在日本领土问题、日本民主化问题及发展日本和平经济问题上完全违反一九四三年的开罗宣言、一九四五年的波茨坦公告及雅尔塔协定的明白规定，在军事问题上，特别违反上述的国际协定。
    美国政府的《对日和约草案》第四章的安全条款，充分暴露了美国企图利用单独缔和达到公开“合法的”无限制地重新武装日本，以日本为基地，以日本人民为炮灰，作为美国继续并扩大侵略朝鲜、中国以及亚洲各国的工具的罪恶目的。第一，它没有防止日本军国主义复活的任何保证，也没有对日本军力作任何限制。波茨坦公告明白规定要完全肃清日本军国主义势力，不允许日本军国主义复活的，而美国草案却恰恰有意不作履行此项规定的保证。盟国在与日本同为第二次大战主要侵略国的意大利的和约中，明白限定意大利的陆、海、空军人数与限额。而美国草案并没有对日本军力作任何限制。这样，美国要公开复活日本军国主义的阴谋，已非常明显。据此，日本反动派就可自行决定为进行所谓“自卫”，需要建立多少军力，就建立多少军力，这无异是对日本军国主义的复活与日本重新武装的公开批准。第二、根据美国草案，美国在单独缔结和约后，将以集体安全名义与日本反动派订立《美日安全协定》，而使美国占领军继续长期留驻日本，并保有军事基地。这样，日本就变成美国的殖民地，并变成美国继续扩大侵略朝鲜、中国与亚洲各国的军事基地。这将是亚洲与世界和平的极大威胁。
  二、美国单独缔和要日本人民作炮灰
    象美国这样的单独对日缔和的办法，既完全违反国际协定及彻底损害其他盟国的合法权益，对日本来说，又是使日本长期沦为美国的殖民地，日本人民变成美国帝国主义的奴隶，变为美国的炮灰。
    根据美国草案，美国占领军在和约缔结后并不撤退，日本基地继续由美国占用。这样，美国陆军便依然控制着日本的领土；美国空军依然停驻在日本密如蛛网的飞机场上，并可往来飞驰；美国海军则又可自由使用和进出日本的军港及领海。美国便完全控制了日本的国防主权和领土。美国更在经济上层层束缚着日本。过去五年以来，美国已经控制了日本大部分产业，美国资本家则利用财阀解散令，廉价购去日本的股票。现在，美国的四十家贸易公司和十二家轮船公司，已经完全控制了日本的贸易。日本的许多产业已变成并正在变成美国的产业。将来和约签订后，美国必定与日本签订广泛的商约，以保护美国的既得利益。美国和约草案还规定，日本须给美国以最惠国待遇或国民待遇，结果，日本便不能实行保护关税，更不能控制进出口贸易。这样日本更无法防止美国进一步地操纵其经济生活，日本也不能与其他国家发展和平的正常的贸易。日本在美制和约缔结后，将完全成为一个美国最卑贱的殖民地。日本人民将变为美国侵略者的奴隶。
    如上所述，这个《对日和约草案》是准许日本重新武装，而且是要在美国帮助之下使日本再武装起来的。为谁武装呢？为美国武装；武装了干什么呢？替美国打仗，当炮灰。日本反动派在吉田领导下，和希特勒一样，利用复仇心理，正在美国占领当局指挥下起劲地武装着日本侵略势力。其结果，必然是在美国奴役之下引火烧身，而使日本人民重遭战争的惨祸。过去的历史已经证明，日本帝国主义的侵略野心的结果只有死路一条；就是美国帝国主义，它也已在侵朝战争中遭受了重大失败，而且最后也将会象过去日本帝国主义那样地被击溃的。日本如果被套上美国的兵车，也只有与车俱焚的一条毁灭前途。首先遭受这种牺牲的是日本的劳动人民。
  三、单独缔和危害亚洲人民
    美国政府不管它利用“援助”的美名也好，或利有“反共”的借口也好，其侵略亚洲各国的实质与日俱彰。美国政府，在亚洲采取了一联串的侵略措施，实行了一联串的侵略活动。它照抄着日寇“欲征服亚洲，必先征服中国”的老路，首先集中力量于征服中国。但是，它在中国的侵略失败了。中华人民共和国成立而且壮大了。美国政府转而继续加紧对亚洲其他国家的侵略，企图把日本、朝鲜、越南、泰国变为美国殖民地及进攻中国与亚洲的基地。同时又加强对菲律滨的经济与军事“援助”，使之变为南太平洋的侵略基地。对于其他国家，美国政府则通过所谓“第四点计划”，来达到经济、政治与军事渗入的目的。
    美国政府这一切侵略步骤，一直发展到对朝鲜的武装侵略战争。美国政府侵略朝鲜的主要目的，就是要在侵占朝鲜以后，进而重新侵略中国与整个亚洲。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国是中华人民共和国亲密的邻邦，它与中国只隔一条鸭绿江。美国武装侵略朝鲜，就直接威胁着中华人民共和国的安全，而且美国已侵占中国的台湾省，并轰炸了中国的东北边疆。因此，中国人民对于美国侵略朝鲜的严重形势与扩大战争的趋势，不能置之不理。全中国各民主党派、人民团体、各阶层人民及海外华侨，相继抗议美国侵略暴行，并激于义愤而纷纷组织援助朝鲜的志愿部队，反抗美国侵略。
    美国侵略者在朝鲜遭受中朝人民军铁拳痛击后，遂积极地准备单独缔结对日和约，以便大规模无限制地武装日本，迫使日本人民充当它的炮灰，扩大侵略战争。这一点，艾奇逊早在一九五○年一月十日就已说过：“美国必须扶植日本，使其成为亚洲反共（即侵略）的一个主要堡垒。”这更证实了美国政府单独缔结对日和约与重新武装日本的政策将首先直接指向朝鲜与中国。
    朝鲜人民已经遭受过日本帝国主义的长期奴役和压迫，而美国今天又已开始部分地利用日本人力物力来侵略朝鲜，真是旧恨又加上了新仇。至于中国人民，更认为日本帝国主义是他们最凶恶的敌人。日本帝国主义从一八九四年中日战争以来，一直侵略中国。一九三一年侵占中国东北数省后，它又于一九三七年发动对中国的全面武装侵略，使中国人民遭受巨大的灾难。中国广大的国土曾遭日寇的铁蹄蹂躏，一千余万人民死于日寇锋刃之下，万余城镇乡村毁于日寇的炮火，财产损失五百余亿美元。中国人民经过艰苦的斗争，好容易才取得了抗日战争的胜利。因此，朝鲜与中国人民都不能容许美国政府复活日本军国主义势力。
    美国政府单独缔结对日和约与重新武装日本的政策也危害亚澳各国人民的利益。在第二次大战中，亚洲各国人民都曾遭受日寇的残酷屠杀与奴役。越南、缅甸、泰国、印尼、菲律滨、马来亚都被日寇直接侵占过，而印度、锡兰、澳洲与新西兰也受到日寇的威胁。如果让美国真正的把日本军国主义复活了，日本侵略势力重新武装起来了，那么，新的战争火焰将又会在整个远东重新燃烧，各国人民将再度遭受新的灾难。
    目前美国政府一面力图单独缔结对日和约，以便公开“合法的”大规模无限制重新武装日本，一面正在变相地灰复日本侵略力量。美国占领当局现在已经武装了二十万日本警察，这个数目相当于一九三○年日本常备军的总数。美国最近还计划建立日本正规陆军四十五万人，并建立一支有五十万吨舰船的海军和一千五百架飞机的空军。美国占领当局也正在积极恢复日本的军事工业，美国侵朝军队所用的物资，有很多是日本军火工厂生产的。到今年五月底，日本工业所接受的美国一般军事定货，为数已接近三亿美元了。日本的飞机场与海港，早已成为侵朝美军的基地。轰炸朝鲜和中国东北边疆的飞机，有许多就是从日本起飞的；侵朝美军的军用物资，不是从日本直接起运，就是由日本海港转运的。
    今天，美国侵略者既可利用日本的基地、人力与物力进攻朝鲜，明天，美国侵略者就可利用日本的基地、人力与物力进攻亚洲各国。因此，亚澳各国人民必须警惕起来，必须进一步采取具体行动反对美国政府的单独缔结对日和约与重新武装日本的非法的与罪恶的政策。
    与美国政府对日和约草案相反的，是苏联政府五月七日提出的《苏联政府关于美国对日和约草案的意见书》，这一意见书已获得中华人民共和国政府与人民的支持，而且也已获得日本人民及亚洲其他各国人民的拥护。那是因为这一意见书中所提出的意见与中华人民共和国的意见完全符合，与日本及亚洲各国人民的意见与利益完全符合。根据苏联政府的意见来缔结对日和约，则日本与盟国之间的战争状态将会真正结束，日本与各国将可和平相处，亚洲各国将不会再遭日本侵略的威胁，而日本也不致长期沦为美国的殖民地及战争基地；并且，日本的和平经济将获得发展，日本与各国互利的贸易将能顺利进行，日本人民将可免于被迫充当美国侵略的炮灰，而过着和平民主的生活。因此，全亚洲的人民在反对美国政府单独缔和的同时，又必须采取积极行动，争取为中国政府所支持的以苏联政府的意见作基础的全面对日和约而斗争。
        四、进一步展开反对美国单独媾和的斗争
    亚洲人民已经开始了反对美国政府单独缔和与重新武装日本的运动，这是非常必要的，而且应该使这一运动更加扩大与深入。为了远东的和平与安全，为了人类的幸福与利益，一切和平民主的斗士，必须更坚决与更勇敢地进行反对美国帝国主义单独缔和及武装日本的斗争。我们确信，只要我们采取正确的步骤，利用一切办法坚持不懈地斗争，就一定可以粉碎美国帝国主义的好战阴谋。
    那么，各国工人阶级及爱好和平的人民应该如何进行反对美国单独媾和与重新武装日本的斗争呢？我们认为：
    第一、亚洲各国工人阶级要在广大人民中间立即广泛而深入地展开一个反对美国单独缔结对日和约与重新武装日本、争取缔结以中华人民共和国中央人民政府所支持的《苏联政府关于美国对日和约草案的意见书》为基础的全面公正对日和约的运动。各国人民可以举行集会、游行示威、发表宣言和发行书刊等办法来表示反对美国单独媾和与重新武装日本和支持“苏联政府关于美国对日和约草案的意见书”中的原则与建议的坚决意志，并可举行控诉美国、日本帝国主义侵略暴行的控诉会。
    第二、团结亚洲各国的工人阶级，号召一切爱好和平的各阶层人民形成一个广泛的反对美国侵略的和平民主阵线，来反对美国单独缔结对日和约，并争取缔结全面和约。亚澳各国工人和工会应积极支持世界和平理事会的建议，召开一个广泛的亚澳人民反对美国侵略、反对武装日本的会议。
    第三、全世界工人与爱好和平的人民应该声援朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军的反侵略战争，并争取朝鲜问题的和平解决。各国工人应该在全体工人团结一致并取得广大人民支持的基础上，反对生产军火和运输军队与物资到朝鲜去进行侵略。
    第四、全世界的工人与爱好和平的人民应该声援日本人民争取和平民主独立及反对单独媾和及重新武装日本的斗争。为此，各国人民首先应该向日本工会、社团、政党、议会及报纸写信，告诉他们，各国人民与日本人民利益是一致的，日本人民应该与亚洲各国人民联合一致，反对美国对日反动政策，反对吉田茂政府勾结美国，出卖日本人民的利益，使美国长期占领日本，强迫人民充当炮灰，把日本变为美国殖民地与军事基地的阴谋。
    第五、日本人民应该拒绝当炮灰，拒绝生产和运输军火，并拒绝运输军队到朝鲜去进行侵略。
    第六、各国工人及爱好和平民主的人民，应该采取积极行动，支援亚洲各被压迫国家人民的民族解放斗争。美国重新武装日本的目的，就是要利用日本一同来镇压亚洲人民的民族解放运动，达到独霸亚洲进而独霸世界的目的。
    只要我们行动起来，我们就可以制止并打烂美国单独媾和及重新武装日本侵略势力的计划。今天，在亚洲，反对美国重新武装日本已成为当务之急，这不仅关系亚洲的和平与安全，也关系着全世界的和平与安全。因此，各国工人阶级与爱好和平、民主的人民，都应积极地参加这一斗争，一直到获得胜利为止。
