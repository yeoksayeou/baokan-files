　　To clear up misunderstandings and disputes on minor issues to facilitate peaceful negotiations
    Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai Reply to Ridgway
    Neutral zone and reporter issues appropriately resolved, removing various excuses recently put forward by the US side, making the Kaesong meeting possible to reopen.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 14th] Our reporter learned from the Korean front headquarters: Yesterday, the US delegation, using the excuse that news reporters had not come to Kaesong for the meeting without our consent, caused the meeting to be suspended for another day. Yesterday afternoon, a notice from Ridgway was received here, raising a new issue of demarcating a neutral zone. Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai replied today. In order to clear up misunderstandings and disputes on some minor issues so that the peace negotiations can proceed smoothly, our side has, in principle, agreed to designate the Kaesong area as a temporary neutral zone during the meeting. Some specific matters related to this issue will be left to the two delegations to resolve. At the same time, the US side was given convenience regarding the issue of news reporters. In this way, all the excuses recently put forward by the US side have been removed, making the reopening of the Kaesong meeting possible.
    The notification from Generals Kim and Peng to Ridgway is as follows:
    General Ridgway:
    Your letter of July 13 has been received. In order to clear up misunderstandings and disputes on some minor issues so that the peace negotiation work can proceed smoothly, we agree to your suggestion to designate the Kaesong area as a neutral zone during the meeting, in which both sides cease any hostile activities and completely exclude armed personnel from the meeting site area and the routes connecting our delegations to the meeting site area. As for the size of this meeting site area and other related specific issues, we suggest that the two delegations resolve them in a meeting.
    The issue of news reporters, which caused this suspension of the meeting, is unrelated to the issue of demarcating a neutral zone. The latter issue was only mentioned once by your liaison officer on July 8, and your delegation has not raised it again. The task of liaison officers is to discuss details, and they have no right to discuss issues of the nature of demarcating a neutral zone.
    The issue of news reporters, which caused this suspension of the meeting, is a small issue and not worth causing a suspension of the meeting, let alone causing the breakdown of the meeting. Your delegation raised this issue at the meeting, and our delegation believed at the time that it was inappropriate for news reporters from various countries to come to Kaesong when the meeting had not achieved any results and even the agenda had not been adopted. Therefore, this issue has not been agreed upon.
    We insist on the principle that all issues must be implemented only after both parties agree, and we believe that this principle is fair and indisputable. Since the issue of news reporters has not been agreed upon, it should not be unilaterally enforced by your side.
    In order to prevent this trivial matter from causing the meeting to be suspended or broken down for a long time, we now agree to your suggestion to regard your news reporter representatives as part of your delegation staff. We have ordered our delegation to give you convenience on this issue as well.
    (Signed) Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army
            Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers
                July 14, 1951

　　扫除枝节问题上的误会和争论以利和平谈判
    金日成彭德怀两将军答复李奇微
    中立区及记者问题均作适当解决，解除了美方最近提出的各种借口，使开城会议有可能重开。
    【新华社平壤十四日电】本社记者从朝鲜前线总部获悉：昨日美方代表团借口新闻记者未得我方同意仍然不来开城开会，以致会议又停顿一天。昨日下午，此间收到了李奇微的一个通知，提出了划中立区的新问题。金日成将军和彭德怀将军本日已予以答复。为了扫除在一些枝节问题上的误会和争辩，使和平谈判得以顺利进行起见，我方在原则上同意将开城地区划为在会议期间的暂时的中立区。有关此问题的一些具体事项，则交双方代表团去解决。同时对于新闻记者问题也给了美方以便利。这样，就解除了美方在最近提出的一切借口，使开城会议有可能重开。
    金、彭两将军给李奇微的通知如下：李奇微将军：
    你的七月十三日的来信收到了。为了扫除在一些枝节问题上的误会和争论，使和平谈判工作得以顺利进行起见，我们同意你所提的将开城地区划为在会议进行期间的中立区，在此区域内双方停止任何敌对活动，及将武装人员完全摒除于会址区域及你我代表团通往会址区域的通路之外的建议。至于这个会址区域的大小及其他有关的具体问题，我们建议交给双方代表团在一次会议上去解决。
    关于引起这次停会的原因的新闻记者问题，是和划中立区的问题无关的。后一个问题自从七月八日贵方连络官提过一次之外，贵方的代表团再也没有提出过。而联络员的任务是讨论细节问题的，无权讨论像划中立区这样性质的问题。
    此次引起停会的原因的新闻记者问题是一个小问题，值不得为这个问题引起停会，更加值不得为这个问题而引起会议的破裂。贵方代表团曾经在会议上提出这个问题，我方代表团当时认为在会议还没有任何成就，并且连议程也没有通过的时候，各国新闻记者来到开城是不适宜的，这个问题因而没有取得协议。
    我们坚持一切问题必须由双方协议才能执行的原则，我们认为这个原则是公平的，无可辩驳的。新闻记者问题既然没有达成协议，就不应当由贵方一方面片面地强制执行。
    为了不因这件小事而使会议陷于长期停顿或破裂起见，我们现在同意你的建议，即将贵方新闻记者代表二十人作为你的代表团工作人员的一部分。我们已命令我方代表团在这个问题上也给贵方以便利。
              （签字）朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成
            中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀
                一九五一年七月十四日
