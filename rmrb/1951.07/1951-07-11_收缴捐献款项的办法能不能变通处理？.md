　　Question from Reader:

　　Can the Methods of Collecting Donations Be Handled Flexibly?
    Question: The General Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea's specific methods for donating weapons stipulate: "For donations from urban residents, please have the donors or organizations/groups directly send the donations to the local People's Bank, obtain a receipt from the receiving bank, and simultaneously write a letter to notify the local branch of the Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea." The donation collection methods agreed upon by the Beijing branch of the Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and the People's Bank branch stipulate that "urban areas can contact the local police station and nearby banks to periodically dispatch mobile donation collection teams." Donating gold and silver jewelry or silver dollars involves going directly to five designated locations for exchange, etc. These methods are inconvenient for the masses in practice. Can they be handled flexibly based on the specific circumstances of a district?
    Answer: The General Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and the Beijing branch's donation methods for urban residents' weapon donations are primarily based on the principles of facilitating the masses and avoiding currency loss during collection. Therefore, as long as these principles are not violated, it is certainly permissible to formulate more specific and feasible collection methods based on the specific circumstances of a district. It is understood that the Sixth District of Beijing has adopted such a flexible method: several donation collection teams composed of representatives from each police station, district, and street handle resident collections, with civil affairs cadres inspecting and supervising to avoid confusion. Funds are collected daily and handed over to the district Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and then transferred to the People's Bank the next day. Workers and industrialists/businessmen hand over funds to the district trade union and the Federation of Industry and Commerce respectively, for transfer to the People's Bank. The advantages of this method are: (1) it reduces the inconvenience for donors who donate thousands of yuan, having to queue at the bank and write letters, which is more conducive to the development of the donation campaign; (2) with the assistance of district and street representatives, the shortage of bank cadres can be compensated for, and their connection with the masses is more conducive to the development of donation work. However, this method also has shortcomings, namely: (1) the absence of bank receipts easily leads to currency loss; (2) especially when collecting gold and silver jewelry, non-professionals do not recognize the goods and it is difficult to grasp the price; (3) the method of collecting funds from residents every day is not entirely practical and increases the workload of activists.
    Therefore, when collecting donations, the methods stipulated by the General Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and the Beijing branch should still be followed fundamentally. In urban areas, the police station should be the base, periodically dispatching mobile donation collection teams (which can be composed of district and street representatives) for collection, while the police station should assign someone to handle daily collection matters to avoid the inconvenience of donors traveling back and forth, and also appropriately solve the problem of activists being too busy every day. However, the police station must negotiate with the nearby People's Bank to obtain a portion of receipt slips to be promptly given to the donors, which both facilitates the masses and avoids confusion. Those donors who wish to directly send donations to the local People's Bank should be allowed to do so voluntarily. As for donating gold and silver jewelry or silver dollars, they should still be exchanged at the designated bank. This is a more appropriate way to handle it, and the masses are reassured.

　　收缴捐献款项的办法能不能变通处理？
    问：抗美援朝总会关于捐献武器的具体办法，规定：“城市人民的捐款，请捐款人或机关、团体一面将捐款直接送交当地人民银行，并向收款之银行索取收据，一面写信通知当地抗美援朝分会。”北京市抗美援朝分会和人民银行分行商定的捐献款项收缴办法，规定“城区者可由派出所与就近银行联系，定期派流动代收捐款小组往收。”而捐献金银首饰银元者，迳到五处指定地点兑缴等办法，在执行起来对群众有很多不便，可否根据一个区的具体情况，变通处理？
    答：中国人民抗美援朝总会和北京市抗美援朝分会，关于城市人民捐献武器的缴款办法，主要是根据便利群众及避免收缴中发生流币的原则而规定的。因此，只要不违背这一原则，根据一个区的具体情况，再拟出更具体可行的收缴款项办法，当然也是允许的。据了解，北京市第六区曾采用了这样的变通办法：即由各派出所区街代表组成若干代收捐款小组，办理居民收款事宜，由民政干事检查、督导，以免发生错乱；每天将款汇集交区抗美援朝会，第二天转交人民银行。工人、工商界则分别交区工会、工商联合会，转交人民银行。这个办法的好处是：（一）可以减少捐款者因捐数千元，而在银行排队缴款和写信的麻烦，也就更有利于捐献运动的开展；（二）有了区街代表的协助，既可补救银行干部的不足，又因他们与群众有一定的联系，更有利于捐献工作的开展。但这个办法亦有缺点，即：（一）没有银行的收据，易生流币；（二）特别是收缴金银首饰，因非专业人员，不识货色，更难掌握价格；（三）每天往居民中收款的办法，也不完全切合实际需要，反加重积极分子的工作。
    因此，在收缴捐款时，基本上仍应根据抗美援朝总会和北京市分会所规定的办法执行。在城区者应以派出所为基点，一面定期派流动代收捐款小组（由区街代表组成亦可）往收，一面由派出所设专人办理每日收缴事宜，以免捐款者往返之劳，亦可适当解决积极分子每日太忙的问题。不过，这里必须由派出所向附近人民银行交涉，领一部分收据单，及时付给捐款者，这样既便利群众，又可避免错乱现象。有些捐款人愿直接送当地人民银行者，应听其自愿。至于捐献金银首饰银元者，仍应按指定银行兑缴。这样办更妥贴，群众也放心。
