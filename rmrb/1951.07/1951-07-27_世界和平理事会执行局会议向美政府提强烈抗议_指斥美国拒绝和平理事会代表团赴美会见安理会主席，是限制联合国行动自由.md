Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, 25th TASS Dispatch: The Executive Bureau meeting of the World Peace Council unanimously passed the "Protest Against the United States' Refusal to Issue Entry Visas to Members of the World Peace Council Delegation Invited by the President of the Security Council." The protest stated:

　　"In February 1951, the World Peace Council passed a resolution to send a delegation to the United Nations. After taking appropriate steps, the World Peace Council received notification that the then-President of the Security Council, Malik, would meet with the delegation at Lake Success. Therefore, members of the delegation individually applied for visas at their local U.S. consulates in order to be able to reach Lake Success at the invitation of the President of the Security Council. However, the U.S. consulates informed them that visas could not be issued.

　　The U.S. authorities' reason was that, according to the 'Agreement Regarding the Headquarters of the United Nations,' their request for visas could not be granted. The U.S. authorities said that the issuance of visas required 'careful study,' but it was too late to consider the delegation members' requests according to normal procedures, and therefore the request could not be considered.

　　The Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council now lodges the strongest protest against this decision. This Executive Bureau does not intend to engage in legal arguments about the meaning of the 'Agreement Regarding the Headquarters of the United Nations.' We only need to point out that, due to the fault of the U.S. authorities, the representatives of the World Peace Council failed to meet with the President of the Security Council as agreed. Regarding this matter, the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council asks people to pay attention to the following:

　　(1) The World Peace Council's adoption of the resolution to send a delegation to the United Nations indicates its willingness to establish contact with this largest international organization in order to convey to it the opinions of hundreds of millions of people regarding the defense of peace. The World Peace Council submits its requests to certain agencies of the United Nations through normal procedures, and these agencies have every right to judge how they should consider this request. If their decisions depend on the prior permission of the United States, then their prestige and independence cannot but be damaged.

　　(2) When the matter concerns a delegation traveling to the United Nations at the invitation of the President of the Security Council or any other agency of the United Nations, violating the above principle is even more serious. If the U.S. government's decision remains in effect, it will greatly restrict the freedom of action and freedom to understand the situation of the highest organs of the United Nations, which should be able to discuss current international issues with any delegation or individual they deem necessary to invite.

　　Based on the above circumstances, the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council protests the decision of the U.S. government. In addition, the Executive Bureau urges international public opinion to pay attention to the dangerous consequences of this decision and reminds the U.S. government that although the headquarters of the United Nations is located within its territory, it is not controlled by it. The Executive Bureau also requests the United Nations to take the necessary measures to fully guarantee its activities and independence in all aspects (including understanding the situation), free from interference and obstruction from any country."

　　世界和平理事会执行局会议向美政府提强烈抗议
　  指斥美国拒绝和平理事会代表团赴美会见安理会主席，是限制联合国行动自由
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社赫尔辛基二十五日讯：世界和平理事会执行局会议一致通过了《对美国拒发入境签证给应安全理事会主席邀请的世界和平理事会代表团团员的抗议》。抗议说：
    “一九五一年二月，世界和平理事会通过了派代表团到联合国的决议。在采取了适当的步骤以后，世界和平理事会接到通知说，当时的安全理事会主席马立克将在成功湖接见代表团。于是代表团团员就分别向他们当地的美国领事馆申请发给签证，以便能够应安全理事会主席的邀请到达成功湖。但是美国领事馆告诉他们说：不能发给签证。
    美国当局的理由是：按照‘关于联合国会址的协定’，不能答应他们申请发给签证的要求。美国当局说：发签证的事情需要经过‘慎重的研究’，但如果按照寻常的手续把代表团团员的请求提出来考虑，也太晚了，因此不能考虑这个要求。
    世界和平理事会执行局现在对这个决定提出最强烈的抗议。本执行局并不打算就‘关于联合国会址的协定’的意义进行法律上的争论。我们只要指出：由于美国当局的过错，世界和平理事会的代表未能如约会见安全理事会主席。关于这件事情，世界和平理事会执行局要求人们注意下述情况：
    （一）世界和平理事会通过关于派代表团到联合国去的决议，就是表示愿意和这个最大的国际机构建立联系，以便把千百万人民有关保卫和平的意见告诉它。世界和平理事会按正常的手续向联合国某些机构提出它的要求，这些机构完全有权判断应该怎样考虑这个要求。如果它们的决定取决于美国的事前许可，那么它们的威信和独立就不能不受到损害。
    （二）当事情关涉到一个应安全理事会主席或联合国其他任何机构的邀请而前往联合国的代表团的时候，违反上述原则就更加严重了。假如美国政府的决定继续有效，那就会大大地限制了联合国最高机构的行动自由和了解情况的自由，这些机构本来是能够和它们认为有必要邀请的任何代表团或个人讨论当前的国际问题的。
    根据上述情况，世界和平理事会执行局抗议美国政府的决定。此外，执行局促请国际舆论注意这个决定的危险结果，并提醒美国政府：联合国总部虽设在它的领土内，但却不是受它控制的。执行局还要求联合国采取必要的措施，以充分保证它在任何方面（包括了解情况方面）的活动和独立，不受任何国家的干涉和阻碍。”
