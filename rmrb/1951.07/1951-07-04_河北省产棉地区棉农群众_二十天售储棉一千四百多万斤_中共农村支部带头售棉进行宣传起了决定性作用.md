Cotton farmers in cotton-producing areas of Hebei Province sold and stored 14.73 million jin of seed cotton from June 1st to 20th.

The leadership at all levels in Hebei Province attached great importance to the instructions of the State Council of the Central People's Government regarding cotton purchase and storage work, and deployed this work to the villages in a very short period of time. The Shijiazhuang, Dingxian, Hengshui, Handan and other special districts and their subordinate counties in the province convened meetings of leading cadres of the Party, government, and various economic departments, as well as professional meetings; and established cotton purchase and storage committees at all levels, responsible for transferring materials to supply farmers, organizing cadres to go to the countryside to inspect and assist work. In order to create working experience in cotton purchase and storage, the leading organs of each special district, county, and district in the province selected key counties and key districts and villages to carry out demonstration work. The leading organs of each special district and county organized a large number of cadres to go to the lower levels to help with the work. All propaganda forces were mobilized to universally carry out patriotic propaganda and education. For example, the Shijiazhuang Special District sent 56 cadres to the counties under its jurisdiction, and Shenxian County sent more than 80 cadres to various villages to conduct cotton purchase demonstrations. Shulu County mobilized more than 1,000 propagandists from the county to carry out propaganda and mobilization in more than 300 villages.

Under the vigorous organization of the Party and the People's Government, the patriotic cotton sales and storage campaign gradually unfolded throughout the province. On the first day of acquisition and storage (June 10th) by the Zhentou Town cotton collection station in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang City, cotton farmers from nearby villages came in groups to sell cotton collectively. On the same day, more than 4,600 jin of seed cotton and more than 1,000 jin of ginned cotton were purchased. Shulu County in the special district purchased and stored more than 900,000 jin of seed cotton in less than half a month. The CCP branch of Beiyukou Village in Cheng'an County, Handan Special District, in its sales challenge letter to the whole country, estimated that 90 percent of all stored cotton would be sold by the end of June, but due to the rapid development of the movement, all 11,000-plus jin of stored cotton had been sold to the state by the 16th.

In this cotton purchase work, the rural branches of the CCP played a decisive role. In villages with great achievements in cotton sales and storage, the Party members took the lead and did arduous work. For example, after receiving instructions from their superiors on cotton sales and storage, the CCP branch of Shouling Village in Mancheng County first conducted studies within the Party to unify the thinking of all Party members. The Party members took the lead in selling all of their stored cotton to the state; and carried out vivid patriotic propaganda and mobilization among the cotton farmers. They also used various methods to carry out arduous education among some cotton farmers who were ideologically backward and had more stored cotton. As a result, more than 4,000 jin of seed cotton from the whole village were sold to the state in two days. Cheng Mianmian, Deputy Secretary of the Angucheng Branch of the CCP in Shulu County, promoted cotton sales to fifteen households with stored cotton, mobilizing them to sell 756 jin of seed cotton.

In the work of purchasing and storing cotton, the province adopted the method of strengthening market management. Before the markets in various cotton-producing areas were strengthened, some cotton merchants did not abide by state policies and raised prices to purchase cotton, which caused a disconnection between the listed price and the market price. In Zhangguzhuang, Bozhuang and other cotton markets in Shulu County, the market price of seed cotton per jin was once 300 to 400 yuan higher than the listed price, and most of the cotton on the market was snapped up by private merchants and peddlers. The purchase volume of the Flower, Yarn, and Cloth Company was less than 20 percent of the amount on the market. The result of the peddlers' raising cotton prices further increased the cotton farmers' psychology of "waiting for higher prices and reluctance to sell." Based on this situation, in addition to conducting patriotic ideological education for private merchants and peddlers to raise their political awareness, state-owned flower, yarn, and cloth companies and cooperatives implemented joint purchases with private merchants at a unified listed price, completely overcoming the phenomenon of disconnection between the listed price and the market price, so that the market cotton purchase situation returned to normal. Some peddlers, after being educated, not only stopped snapping up cotton, but also voluntarily sold their stored cotton to the state. Twenty-four peddlers in the Zhangguzhuang cotton market in Shulu County sold 9,350 jin of seed cotton to the state.

After selling their stored cotton, cotton farmers all needed to purchase some production and living materials to a greater or lesser extent. Therefore, while deploying cotton purchase and storage, state-owned companies in the province transferred more than 11.9 million jin of grain and 240,000 tons of coal to various cotton-producing areas. Dingxian Special District also supplied cotton farmers with a large amount of bean cake and edible salt. When cotton farmers in Xinxing Village, Lixian County, saw that it was convenient to buy things, 124 households sold more than 10,000 jin of cotton to the state in two days.

　　河北省产棉地区棉农群众
    二十天售储棉一千四百多万斤
    中共农村支部带头售棉进行宣传起了决定性作用
    河北省棉产区棉农群众从六月一日到二十日售、储籽棉已达一千四百七十三万斤。
    河北省各级领导机关对中央人民政府政务院关于购棉储棉工作的指示极为重视，在很短时间内，就把这一工作布置到村。该省石家庄、定县、衡水、邯郸等专区及所属各县，都召开了党、政及各经济部门主要干部会议、专业会议；并建立了各级的购、储棉委员会，负责调运物资供应农民，组织干部下乡检查及帮助工作。为创造购储棉的工作经验，该省各专区、县和区的领导机关，都选定重点县和重点区、村，进行示范工作。各专区、县的领导机关，都组织了大批的干部到下层帮助工作。动员了所有的宣传力量，普遍地开展爱国主义宣传教育。如石家庄专区派出五十六个干部到所属各县，深县派出八十多个干部到各村进行购棉示范。束鹿县动员了全县一千多个宣传员到全县三百多个村庄展开宣传动员。
    在党和人民政府的大力组织下，售、储爱国棉运动在全省范围内逐步展开。石家庄市郊区振头镇收棉站收购储存的头一天（六月十日），附近村庄的棉农即成群结队前来集体售棉。当天收购籽棉四千六百多斤，皮棉千多斤。该专区之束鹿县不到半月工夫，收购储存籽棉九十多万斤。邯郸专区成安县北鱼口村中共支部向全国发出的售棉挑战书中，预计六月底售出全部存棉百分之九十，但因运动开展迅速，至十六日即已将全部存棉一万一千多斤都卖给国家。
    在此次购棉工作中，中共农村支部起了决定性的作用。凡售、储棉成绩大的村庄，都是党员带头，并作了艰苦的工作。如满城县守陵村中共支部，在接到上级售、储棉指示后，首先在党内进行了学习，统一了全体党员的思想。党员首先把存棉全部卖给国家；并向棉农进行了生动的爱国主义宣传动员。对一些思想落后而存棉较多的棉农，更用各种方法进行了艰苦的教育。结果，两天就把全村四千多斤籽棉卖给国家。中共束鹿县安古城支部副书记程绵绵带病向十五家存棉户进行宣传，动员他们售出籽棉七百五十六斤。
    在购、储棉工作中，该省采取了加强市场管理的办法。各棉产区的集市在未加强管理前，部分棉商不遵守国家政策，抬价收购，曾造成牌价和市价的脱节。束鹿县张古庄、泊庄等棉花市场，每斤籽棉市价曾高出牌价三、四百元，上市棉花多为私商小贩抢购而去，花纱布公司收购量不及上市量的百分之二十。小贩哄抬棉价的结果，更增加了棉农的“看涨惜售”心理。该省根据这一情况，除向私商小贩进行爱国的思想教育，提高其政治觉悟外，同时由国营花纱布公司、合作社与私商按照统一牌价实行联购，完全克服了牌价与市价脱节的现象，使市场购棉情况恢复正常。有些小贩经过教育，不仅不再抢购，还自动地把自己的存棉卖给国家。束鹿县张古庄棉花市场的二十四名小贩，将籽棉九千三百五十斤卖给国家。
    棉农卖掉存棉后，都或多或少的要购进一些生产和生活资料。因此该省各国营公司在布置购棉储棉的同时，便调运了粮食一千一百九十多万斤，煤炭二十四万吨到各产棉区。定县专区还供给了棉农大量的豆饼和食盐。蠡县辛兴村棉农见到买东西方便了，在两天内就有一百二十四户卖出一万多斤棉花给国家。
