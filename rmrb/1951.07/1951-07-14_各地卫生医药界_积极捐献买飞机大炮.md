　　Xinhua News Agency, 13th -- Health and medical circles in various regions are actively donating to buy airplanes and cannons, and are extensively carrying out work to provide preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and military personnel.

　　After the Northeast Health Workers Association General Association initiated the call to donate for three "Northeast Health" airplanes, health workers in Jilin City, Heilongjiang Province, and other places responded enthusiastically. In addition to already donating ten million yuan, the Chinese Medical Association General Association has specifically suggested to the national health and medical community to launch a movement to donate ambulances and medical vehicles. The medical community in Hubei Province has also initiated a donation for one "Hubei Health" fighter plane. Health and medical workers in Jiangxi Province are also actively launching a donation movement. The medical community in Guangzhou has already donated over two billion yuan in Renminbi.

　　During the donation movement, health and medical groups or individuals in various regions have established many ways to increase income in order to complete the donation plan. Medical and health workers in Dalian and Lushun have formed an amateur clinic, donating all of their income. All students of the Nurses School attached to the Wanbei Southeast Medical School in Anhui Province are using their spare time to participate in washing, sewing, making masks, etc., donating all of their income.

　　In conjunction with carrying out the donation movement, the medical community in various regions is making the preferential treatment of the families of martyrs and military personnel a major part of their patriotic pacts. Hospitals, clinics, and practicing physicians in Jilin City have all established preferential treatment plans to ensure that the families of martyrs and military personnel can enjoy free or half-price treatment. The medical community in Jinan City, the Health Workers Association in Lichuan County, Jiangxi Province, and the medical community in Mamuzhen, Shangqiu, Henan Province, have all decided that the cost of medicine for the families of martyrs and military personnel will be discounted by 20%, and registration fees will be waived. The cost of medicine for impoverished families of martyrs will be reduced or waived entirely at their discretion.

    【新华社十三日讯】各地卫生医药界积极捐献飞机大炮，并广泛开展优待烈士家属、军人家属的工作。
    东北卫生工作者协会总会发起捐献“东北卫生号”飞机三架的号召以后，吉林市、黑龙江省等地的卫生工作者都热烈响应。中华医学会总会除已捐出一千万元外，特向全国卫生医药界建议展开捐献救护机、救护汽车的运动。湖北省医药界亦发起捐献“湖北卫生号”战斗机一架。江西省卫生医药工作者也积极展开捐献运动。广州市医药界已捐献了人民币二十亿元以上。
    各地卫生医药团体或个人在捐献运动中，订出许多增加收入的办法，来完成捐献计划。旅大市医药卫生工作者组成业余诊所，把收入全部捐献。皖北东南医学校附属护士学校全体学生利用课余时间参加洗衣、缝纫、做口罩等等，将收入全部捐献。
    和开展捐献运动同时，各地医药界都把优待烈士家属、军人家属的工作作为爱国公约的主要内容。吉林市各医院、诊所及开业医师都订出优待计划，保证使烈士家属和军人家属能享受到免费或半免费的优待。济南市医药界、江西黎川县卫生工作者协会及河南商邱马牧镇等地医药界，都决定烈士家属、军人家属治病所用药价一律按八折优待，并免收挂号费。贫苦烈士家属的药费酌予减收或全免。
