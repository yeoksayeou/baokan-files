Several Problems that Should be Addressed in Developing Agricultural Production in the Xingxian Special District
    By our special correspondent Wu Guangtang

Editor's Note: This report, in the spirit of "adapting to local conditions," puts forward important suggestions for agricultural production in the Xingxian Special District of Shanxi. These suggestions proceed from the local reality (such as various natural conditions, the level of awareness of farmers, farming habits, etc.), and advocate taking some working steps that are both beneficial to the present and beneficial to the future, in order to guide farmers to gradually get rid of poverty and move towards prosperity, which is worthy of attention.

    Some of the viewpoints put forward in this article, such as developing transportation, promoting local products, developing animal husbandry and forestry, and changing farming methods, are even more worthy of study for some areas with inconvenient transportation.

    The natural conditions of the Xingxian Special District in Shanxi are relatively complex. The climate is cold, and naked oats are the main crop. Only along the river is it slightly warmer, where spring wheat and cotton can be planted, and millet is also a major crop. The counties of Shenchi, Wuzhai, Kelan, and Lanxian produce more grain, have surplus grain to sell, and produce a large number of oilseeds. Linxian and Lishi have slightly insufficient grain. Due to inconvenient transportation and difficulties in trade, people's economic lives are greatly affected. After several years of production movements following land reform, production in the special district has recovered, and the masses' grain consumption has gradually increased, but the scissors difference between industrial and agricultural products is large, and the masses have extreme difficulty in obtaining clothing and supplies. In some mountainous areas, such as the Second District of Pianguan, the First and Fourth Districts of Baode, the Third and Sixth Districts of Xingxian, the North Fifth District of Linxian, and some areas of Lanxian and Fangshan, about 100,000 people still eat bran wowo (steamed cornbread) and oat flour paste. Clothing and bedding are particularly difficult. This is a major problem that the masses in the Xingxian Special District urgently need to solve.

    The Xingxian Special District is an old liberated area, and the people have made great contributions to the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War. The damage caused by the war to the people's economic life is also very serious. However, for more than ten years, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people of the Xingxian Special District have raised their awareness, and various tasks have a good foundation. The villages we have visited do indeed have a new atmosphere after land reform. The task before us is: to adapt to the local characteristics, further develop agricultural production in the Xingxian Special District, organize the people's economic life, so that the people of the Xingxian Special District can completely get rid of poverty and gradually move towards prosperity.

    We have studied the agricultural production, forestry, and animal husbandry situation in the Xingxian Special District, as well as the transportation construction and material exchange situation. The following are several major issues:

    First, transportation construction is an important key to the further development of agricultural production in the Xingxian Special District. The Northwest is mostly mountainous, and transportation is inconvenient. Grain and local products cannot be transported out, and prices are very low. In Lanxian (240 li from Taiyuan), the market price of millet on March 20 was 6,800 yuan per dou (a unit of dry volume, approximately 10 liters), and wheat was 8,300 yuan per dou, which is about half the price in Taiyuan. Last summer, eggs were only 50 yuan each, but this year, as a result of the establishment of an egg processing factory in Lishi and vigorous promotion, the price has risen to 150 yuan each. Prices are even lower in other more remote areas. Also due to inconvenient transportation, daily necessities are not easily transported in, especially cotton cloth and other daily necessities are extremely expensive, and the price ratio to grain is very different, which is the main reason why the farmers in the Xingxian Special District have particular difficulty in obtaining clothing and bedding. Therefore, how to open up transportation has become an important key to developing agricultural production. The Shanxi Provincial People's Government once used 2 million jin of millet to build the Heihe-Shexian Highway. Farmers in Xingxian, Lanxian, and other counties paid a considerable amount of labor to build this road. The Party, government, and people of the Xingxian Special District have infinite enthusiasm for opening up transportation lines. The masses along the way were extremely excited when the transportation company test-drove in Xingxian. They fully understand that cars will bring them happiness. Therefore, it is very urgent to repair the Heihe-Shexian line in a short period of time and immediately organize transportation to answer the people's hopes.

    However, it is not enough to only open the Heihe-Shexian line. According to the specific local conditions, we should do everything possible to increase the construction of highways and cart roads, and provide the masses with sufficient vehicles (establish a cart manufacturing factory and provide loans to support it, etc.), so that the transportation in the Xingxian Special District can be gradually organized. If the result of opening up transportation in the Xingxian Special District can increase the price of grain and other local products by 20%, the people will greatly benefit.

    Second, vigorously promoting local products and carrying out necessary agricultural product processing in the Xingxian Special District are also problems that need to be solved urgently. At present, only the Grain and General Merchandise companies have institutions in the Xingxian Special District, and they have played a great role. Other departments such as local products, oils, egg products, and pig bristles also need to pay special attention to the work in the Xingxian Special District and establish permanent institutions as much as possible. The Oil Company sent people to Xingxian in early April to purchase oilseeds. The price of flaxseed rose from 12,000 yuan per dou to 20,000 yuan, and the price of hemp rose from 7,000 yuan per dou to 12,000 yuan. Such prices, plus freight, are lower than the market price in Taiyuan. Other pig bristles, egg products, and mountain goods are also mostly like this. This situation fully shows that the Xingxian Special District not only has transportation difficulties, but also organizing the promotion and regular purchase of local products is a problem that needs to be solved urgently. Carrying out agricultural product processing to reduce freight is also an important way to increase the price of agricultural products. The quality of eggs in the Xingxian Special District is very high, and 35 million to 40 million eggs can be produced each year. If sales are good, more can be produced. However, there is only one egg processing factory in Lishi, and the factory can only process a maximum of 10 million eggs each year, and the location is very biased to the south, so it is not easy to transport the eggs from the north. Therefore, new egg processing factories should be built in suitable locations to solve the problem. In addition, we can also consider establishing machine oil extraction factories, which can reduce the freight of oilseeds and retain oil cakes as fertilizer.

    Developing the liquor industry in mountainous areas is also one of the historical ways to solve the problem of grain output in mountainous areas. Before the war, there were more than 150 liquor houses in the eleven counties of the Xingxian Special District, with an annual output of about 3 million jin of liquor (requiring more than 10 million jin of grain). In addition to local sales (250,000 jin of naked oats are needed for seed mixing each year), a large amount is sold to Fenyang, Xinzhou, and other places. At present, there are only four liquor houses in the entire special district. In 1950, a total of 360,000 jin of liquor were produced, only one-tenth of that before the war. According to calculations by comrades from the Liquor Monopoly Bureau of the Xingxian Special District, if the price of liquor in the Xingxian Special District plus freight is added, each jin of liquor can still earn a profit of 425 yuan more. If large factories are built to produce liquor, the cost of each jin of liquor can be reduced by one jin of grain. That is to say, although we have to pay part of the construction cost of liquor factories in mountainous areas at the beginning, the grain saved by reducing costs within one year can reach one time the construction cost of the factory (each factory needs 150,000 jin of millet, and each factory can save 300,000 jin of millet per year). Therefore, it is suggested that liquor production should be stopped in the plains with convenient transportation, and most of the liquor industry should be transferred to the mountainous areas with inconvenient transportation and low grain prices. This has three advantages, namely, the mountainous areas have a market for grain, the plains can export grain, and the profits of the liquor monopoly can be increased.

    Third, animal husbandry and forestry are also the main development directions of the Xingxian Special District in addition to agriculture. Before the war, there were about 92,000 head of cattle, 68,000 head of mules, horses, and donkeys, totaling 160,000 head of livestock in the eleven counties of the entire special district. Now there are a total of 80,700 head of cattle and more than 31,900 head of mules, horses, and donkeys, totaling 112,600 head, which is about 70% of that before the war. Before the war, the livestock in the special district was not only used for service but also bred and sold in large quantities. The cattle in Xingxian and the donkeys in Linxian were both famous. The livestock breeding rate in the special district is also relatively high. According to statistics from Xingxian and other places, the cattle breeding rate is over 20%. Xingxian County alone sold 1,695 large cattle to other areas last year, with an estimated income of 25,000 shi of millet. Sheep flocks are also a specialty of the Xingxian Special District. Before the war, there were about 1.2 million sheep in the eleven counties (more than one per person), but now there are only 460,000, which is about 38.3% of that before the war. Pig raising has now reached one pig per three households, and some villages, such as Baijiagou and Hejiagetai in Xingxian, have reached two pigs per household. There are already 800,000 chickens raised, close to one per person. This is a good foundation. If we can strengthen the leadership of animal husbandry and further develop it, it is entirely possible to reach one female livestock per two households, one female sheep and one sow per household, and one hen per person in the next few years. In this way, each household can increase its income by 10 to 12 shi of millet per year, which is about equal to the average annual grain income of farmers in Xingxian at present. According to the historical situation before the war, the natural conditions in the Northwest, and the experience of advanced villages in developing animal husbandry, the above goals are entirely achievable. Therefore, animal husbandry in the Xingxian Special District should be one of the key points, and in some areas, it can be given the same importance as agriculture. At present, the following problems should be gradually solved: (1) Delineate animal husbandry areas, cultivate wild pasture in a planned way, and promote the planting of improved pasture varieties. The Xingxian Special District has a large area of land, and some areas already have the habit of planting alfalfa. Vigorous promotion can be achieved. (2) Improve breeding livestock in a planned way, and impart scientific breeding techniques to improve quality and increase survival rates. With the gradual opening up of transportation and the development of transportation, the raising of mules and horses should be promoted. (3) Improve feeding management, establish epidemic prevention organizations, transform traditional Chinese veterinarians, establish veterinary stations, and promote livestock insurance to improve livestock health. (4) Reward breeding, provide loans for breeding livestock and female livestock, promote cooperation, and encourage and support farmers to develop animal husbandry under the conditions of mutual combination and mutual support between agriculture and animal husbandry.

    The Xingxian Special District also has natural conditions for developing forestry. However, the Northwest has a vast area with a sparse population, and the masses have a hard life. Large-scale afforestation is still difficult at present. Therefore, we should start from the following three aspects: (1) First, we should resolutely stop land reclamation, and carry out mountain closure and afforestation, and stop reclamation and afforestation in areas with conditions. There are still nearly 10,000 people in the mountainous areas who are living in extreme difficulty, and most of them live scattered in individual households. It is difficult to carry out political education and implement democratic life, and they often become loopholes in public security work. These areas have actually become dead corners of all work. Due to poor production conditions, the local masses indiscriminately reclaim barren slopes, which makes it impossible to conserve water and soil. They also often burn down forests, causing heavy losses. Therefore, from a long-term perspective, is it possible to consider moving these scattered mountain people down the mountain in a planned way and properly resettling them? Of course, it may be difficult to do this after land reform, but it is estimated that in the Xingxian Special District, with its wide land area, it is still possible to settle one household in one village. (2) Focus on promoting cooperative afforestation and first try it out in areas with a foundation for organization. (3) Promote mixed afforestation, first plant mountain peaches, mountain apricots, and other forest trees that are harvested earlier, and gradually develop. Along the Yellow River, vigorously promote the cultivation of fruit trees, and fruit trees can also be tried in mountainous areas.

    Fourth, changing farming methods, promoting the repair of sloping land into terraced fields, and promoting intensive cultivation to gradually change the geology and improve soil fertility are also one of the important keys to agricultural construction in the Xingxian Special District. At present, farmers reclaim wasteland when they have surplus labor. Therefore, more than 80% of the land is sloping land, which cannot store water and cannot accumulate the vitality of the land. This method of using land is unscientific and violates the long-term interests of farmers. It must be vigorously promoted to change. The second is to experiment with pasture rotation. In the Northwest, with its vast land area and the development of animal husbandry, pasture rotation is easier to achieve. Agricultural farms, advanced mutual aid teams, and rural cooperatives in various places are required to implement it first. The third is to increase the planting of industrial crops. Planting cotton and ramie in the river areas of Hequ, Baode, Pianguan, Xingxian, Linxian, and Lishi has greater gains than grain crops. Hehui Village in Hequ has a total of 1,300 mu of land. In recent years, it has been promoting cotton planting. Last year, it reached 600 mu, and each mu can produce 20 jin (lint), which is five times higher in value than planting grain crops. Therefore, Hehui Village has become increasingly prosperous. If assistance can be provided in terms of varieties and technology, there is still a lot of land that can be converted to cotton. The northern counties have the habit of planting oilseeds such as flaxseed and hemp, which can also be vigorously promoted. In addition, winter wheat and other possible autumn crops can also be tried. Finally, we should pay great attention to the combination of agricultural and sideline production. With the low grain prices in the Xingxian Special District, developing sideline production is an urgent requirement of farmers at present, and it also has a major supporting role for agriculture. At present, most of the advanced mutual aid teams in the Xingxian Special District are established on the basis of the combination of agricultural and sideline production. This fact should attract our sufficient attention. Therefore, rural production in the Xingxian Special District should be organized, improve technology, and combine with sideline production. The scope of sideline production is very wide. In addition to animal husbandry and forestry, various workshops, handicrafts, and transportation industries can be promoted according to local conditions.

    In short, agricultural production is diverse, and various conditions are complex. The Xingxian Special District is even more diverse and complex. It is necessary to adapt to local conditions and determine the key points. At the same time, it should also be admitted that agriculture in the Northwest is still lagging behind other regions. In terms of leadership ideology, we must dare to break historical habits, oppose conservatism, and boldly promote what has been affirmed through experiments and research among the masses. This is a very important issue.

　　兴县专区发展农业生产应注意解决的几个问题
    本报特约记者  武光汤
    编者按：这篇报道，根据“因地制宜”的精神，对于山西兴县专区的农业生产提出了重要的建议。这些建议从当地的实际情况（如各种自然条件，农民的觉悟程度，耕作习惯等）出发，主张采取一些既利于现在又利于将来的工作步骤，以引导农民逐步摆脱贫困、走向富裕，是值得重视的。
    这篇文章中提出的若干观点，如发展交通，推销土产，发展牧畜与林业，改变耕作方法等，对于若干交通不便的地区，更值得加以研究。
    山西兴县专区的自然情况，是较复杂的。气候寒冷，莜麦是主要作物。唯沿河稍暖，可以种植春小麦和棉花，糜谷亦为大宗。神池、五寨、岢岚、岚县出产粮食较多，有余粮要求出售，并产大批油籽。临县、离石粮食稍嫌不足。由于交通不便，贸易困难，人民经济生活颇受影响。经过土地改革后几年来的生产运动，该专区生产已经恢复，群众用粮逐渐增加，但工农产品剪刀差额较大，群众衣服用品极为困难。部分山区如偏关二区，保德一、四区，兴县三、六区，临县北五区，岚县、方山等一部地区，约十余万人口，群众仍多以糠窝窝、莜面糊为食。衣被特别困难。这是兴县专区群众，迫切要求解决的大问题。
    兴县专区是老解放区，人民对抗日战争与解放战争的贡献是很大的。战争对人民经济生活的破坏也是十分严重的。但在十余年来，兴县专区人民在共产党领导下，觉悟程度提高了，各种工作亦有很好的基础，我们走过的村子，确实有土地改革后的新气象。摆在我们面前的任务是：适应当地的特点，进一步发展兴县专区农业生产，组织人民的经济生活，使兴县专区人民彻底摆脱贫困，逐步走向富裕。
    我们研究了兴县专区的农业生产及林牧情况，也研究了交通建设与物资交流情况。兹将几个主要问题分述如下：
    第一、交通建设是目前兴县专区农业生产进一步发展的重要关键。西北多山，交通不便。粮食土产运不出来，价格很低。岚县（离太原二百四十里）三月二十日小米市价每斗六千八百元，小麦每斗八千三百元，约等于太原市价的半数。鸡蛋去夏每个仅五十元，今年因在离石设立了打蛋厂及大力推销的结果，每个涨到一百五十元。在其他更偏僻的地区价格更低。也由于交通不便，日用必需品很不容易运进来，特别是棉布等日用品价格极高，和粮食比价相差很远，这就是兴县专区农民衣被特别困难的主要原因。因此，如何开辟交通，成为发展农业生产的重要关键。山西省人民政府曾以小米二百万斤，修通了黑涉公路。兴县、岚县等县农民，为了修这条路，支付了相当数量的劳力。兴县专区党、政及人民对开辟交通线是具有无限热望的，此次运输公司在兴县试车，沿途群众异常兴奋。他们十分了解，汽车将会给他们带来幸福。因此如何能在短时期内将黑涉线修通并立即组织运输，以回答人民的热望，是非常急迫的。
    但仅开辟黑涉线是非常不够的。应该根据当地具体情况，尽一切可能，增修公路与大车路，并供给群众以足够车辆（建立大车制造厂，并给以贷款扶植等），这样就可以使兴县专区的交通运输逐步组织起来。如果因为开辟兴县专区交通运输的结果，能使粮食及其他土产价格提高百分之二十，人民获利即是很大的。
    第二、大力推销土产，并在兴县专区进行必要的农产加工，同样是目前迫切要求解决的问题。目前仅有粮食、百货两公司在兴县专区设有机构，都起了很大的作用。其他如土产、油脂、蛋品、猪鬃等部门，亦需要特别注意兴县专区的工作，尽可能设立常驻机构。油脂公司在四月初派人赴兴县采购油籽，胡麻每斗由一万二千元涨到二万元，大麻每斗由七千元涨到一万二千元，这样的价格加上运费到达太原，比太原市价还低。其他猪鬃、蛋品、山货亦大都如此。这种情况充分说明，兴县专区不仅是交通困难，组织推销及定期收购土产，也是一个迫切要求解决的问题。进行农产品加工以减低运费，也是提高农业产品价格的重要方法。兴县专区的鸡蛋质量是很高的，每年可产三千五百万个到四千万个。销路好了，还可多产。但仅离石有一个打蛋厂，该厂每年最多仅能打蛋一千万个，且地址很偏于南面，北面的蛋即不易运出。因此，还应选择适宜地点，新建打蛋厂，方能解决问题。此外，并可考虑设立机器榨油厂，既可以减低油籽运费，并可截留油饼充作肥料。
    在山地发展烧酒业，也是历史上解决山地粮食出路的办法之一。战前兴县专区十一县共有酒房一百五十座以上，年产酒约三百万斤（需粮千余万斤），除本地推销外（莜麦拌种即年需二十五万斤），大量行销汾阳、忻州等地。目前全专区仅有四座酒房，一九五○年共产酒三十六万斤，仅及战前十分之一。经与兴县专区酒业专卖处同志计算，若在兴县专区烧酒加上运费价，每斤酒尚可多获利润四百二十五元。若建立大厂烧酒，则每斤酒可减低成本粮食一斤。也就是说我们在山地烧酒，最先虽然要支付一部酒厂修建费用，但一年内减低成本节余之粮食，即可达建厂费之一倍（每建一厂需小米十五万斤，每厂一年可节约小米三十万斤）。因此建议停止平原交通便利地区的烧酒，把烧酒业大部转入交通不便、粮食价低之山地。这样有三利，即山地粮食有销路，平原粮食可出口，酒业专卖利润可提高。
    第三、牧畜与林业也是兴县专区除农业之外主要发展的方向。全专区十一个县，战前约有牛九万二千头，骡马驴六万八千头，合计有牲畜十六万头。现在共有牛八万○七百余头，骡马驴三万一千九百头，共计十一万二千六百头，约当战前百分之七十。战前该专区牲畜除役用外，并大量繁殖出售。兴县之牛、临县之驴都具盛名。该专区牲畜繁殖率亦较高，据兴县等地统计，牛繁殖率达百分之二十以上。仅兴县一县去年即卖给外区大牛一千六百九十五头，约计收入小米二万五千石。羊群亦为兴县专区特产，战前十一县约计一百二十万只（每人一只还多），现在仅有四十六万只，约当战前百分之三八点三。养猪现在已达三户一猪，有些村子如兴县白家沟贺家圪台等村，则已达一户二猪。养鸡已达八十万只，接近每人一只。这是很好的基础。如果我们能加强对牧畜工作的领导，使之进一步的发展，在最近几年之内，达到每两户一只母牲畜，每户一只母羊、一口母猪，每人一只母鸡，则是完全可能的。这样，可使每户每年增加小米十石至十二石的收入，约等于目前兴县农民每年平均粮食收入。根据战前的历史情况和西北的自然条件，及目前先进村发展牧畜事业的经验，上述目标是完全可以实现的。因此兴县专区的牧畜业应当作重点之一，在若干地区并可与农业同等重视。目前应逐步解决以下问题：（一）划定牧畜区，有计划地培养野生牧草，并提倡种植优种牧草。兴县专区土地较广，部分地区已有种植苜蓿习惯，大力提倡当可办到。（二）有计划地改良种畜，传授科学配种技术，以提高质量增加成活率。在交通逐渐开辟、运输发展的条件下，应提倡多养骡马。（三）改善饲养管理，建立防疫组织，改造中兽医，建立兽医站，提倡家畜保险，以增进牧畜健康。（四）奖励繁殖，举办种畜母畜贷款，提倡合作，鼓励与扶植农民在农牧互相结合、互相支援的条件下，发展牧畜事业。
    发展林业，兴县专区亦具有天然条件。但西北地广人少，群众生活较苦，大量造林目前尚有困难，因此目前应从以下三方面动手：（一）首先应坚决停止开荒，有条件地区进行封山育林，停垦造林。山区尚有近万人口生活极端困难，且大多一家一户分散居住，进行政治教育与实行民主生活都有困难，往往成为治安工作的漏洞。这些地区实际上成为一切工作的死角。当地群众因生产条件不好，乱垦荒坡，使水土不能保持；又常焚毁山林，造成重大损失。因此，从长远利益出发，是否可以考虑将这些零星山民有计划地移下山来，予以妥当安置。当然在土地改革后这样做可能有困难，但估计在兴县专区土地宽广的条件下，如果一个村安置一户还是可能做到的。（二）有重点地提倡合作造林，在有组织起来基础地区首先试办。（三）提倡混合造林，先种山桃山杏等收获较早的林木，逐渐发展。沿黄河一线，大量提倡栽培果树，山地亦可试种果木。
    第四、改变耕作方法，提倡修坡地为梯田；提倡精耕细作，以求逐步改变地质，提高地力，这也是兴县专区农业建设的重要关键之一。目前农民有了剩余劳力就开荒，因此，百分之八十以上是坡地，不能涵储水份，不能积蓄土地的生命力。这样利用土地的方法是不合科学的，是违背农民长远利益的，必须大力提倡改变。其次是试验牧草轮作。在西北土地宽广，牧畜发展的条件下，牧草轮作更易实现，要求各地农场、先进的互助组、农村合作社首先实行。再次增植工艺作物。河曲、保德、偏关、兴县、临县、离石等沿河地区种植棉花、洋麻，较粮食作物收获为大，河曲河会村共地一千三百亩，在近几年来提倡种棉，去年已达六百亩，每亩可产二十斤（皮棉），较种植粮食作物价值高出五倍，因之河会村已日渐富裕。如能在品种及技术等各方面予以帮助，尚有不少土地可以改种棉花。北边各县有种胡麻、大麻等油籽的习惯，亦可大量提倡种植。此外，并可试种冬小麦及其他可能的大秋作物。最后应十分重视农副业结合。在兴县专区粮食价格较低的情况下，发展副业为农民当前的迫切要求，对于农业亦有重大支援作用。目前兴县专区的先进互助组，大多数建立在农副业结合的基础上，这一事实应引起我们足够重视。因此，兴县专区的农村生产，应是组织起来，提高技术，并结合副业。副业范围很广，除牧畜、林业外，各种作坊手工业、运输业，都可因地制宜加以提倡。
    总之，农业生产是多样性的，各种条件是复杂的，兴县专区更加多样与更加复杂。必须因地制宜，确定重点。同时也应该承认西北农业尚落后于其他地区，在领导思想上要敢于打破历史习惯，反对保守，经过试验研究肯定了的东西，要大胆在群众中提倡。这是很重要的一个问题。
