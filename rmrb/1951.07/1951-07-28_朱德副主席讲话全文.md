Fellow representatives, fellow students:
    The 15th National Student Congress of China is about to close today. Your congress has been fruitful, and I extend my congratulations to you on behalf of the Central People's Government!

    Chinese students have a glorious tradition of revolutionary struggle. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, Chinese students have truly become masters of the country and an important reserve force for building a new China. The enslaved and oppressed status of students in old China has been fundamentally changed, and the threat of hunger and unemployment will no longer exist; a bright and splendid future lies before you. Your current task is to learn your skills well, prepare your strength, participate in the construction of our great and lovable motherland, and strive to oppose the new war plans of imperialism, consolidate national defense, and defend the peaceful construction of the motherland.

    The task of building a new China is very important. In order to successfully complete this task, I hope that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, you will work hard to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, study various scientific knowledge of national defense construction, economic construction, and cultural construction, pay attention to physical exercise, and cultivate a strong and indomitable will and the virtue of observing discipline. Only in this way can we dedicate our greatest strength to building today's New Democracy and the future socialism and communism.

    Youth is the future of the country. Students! You live in the happy era of Stalin and Mao Zedong, and you should cherish your youth, strive to train yourselves, and prepare sufficient strength to struggle for the beautiful life of all the working people of China!

　　朱德副主席讲话全文各位代表、各位同学：
    中华全国学生第十五届代表大会今天要闭幕了。你们的大会是有收获的，我代表中央人民政府向你们致以贺意！
    中国学生有光荣的革命斗争的传统。自中华人民共和国成立以后，中国学生真正地成为国家的主人，成为建设新中国的重要后备力量。过去旧中国学生的被奴役、被压迫的地位已经根本改变，受饥饿和失业的威胁也不会再有了；光辉灿烂的远景，摆在大家的面前。你们现在的任务，就是要学好本领，准备力量，参加建设我们这个伟大、可爱的祖国；并为反对帝国主义新的战争计划，巩固国防，保卫祖国的和平建设而努力。
    建设新中国的任务是很重大的。为了胜利地完成这个任务，希望你们在中国共产党和中央人民政府领导之下，努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，学习国防建设、经济建设和文化建设的各种科学知识，注意体格的锻炼，养成坚强刚毅的意志和遵守纪律的美德。只有这样，才能为建设今天的新民主主义和将来的社会主义、共产主义而献出自己最大的力量。
    青年是国家的未来。同学们！你们生活在幸福的斯大林和毛泽东的时代，应该十分爱惜自己的青春，努力锻炼自己，准备好充分的力量，为建设全中国劳动人民美好的生活而奋斗！
