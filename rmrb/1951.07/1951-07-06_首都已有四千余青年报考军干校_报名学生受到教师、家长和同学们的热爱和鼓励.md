　　Over Four Thousand Youths in the Capital Have Applied to Military Cadre Schools
    Enrolling Students Receive Love and Encouragement from Teachers, Parents, and Classmates
    [Reported by this newspaper] As of July 5th, 4,668 youths in the capital have applied to various military cadre schools, including 4,309 students from major universities and middle schools, and 359 social youths and senior elementary school graduates. Students determined to join military cadre schools have received love and encouragement from teachers, parents, and classmates. Municipal No. 8 Middle School, New Life Boys' Middle School, and other schools decorated the registration sites magnificently, hanging portraits of Chairman Mao and national flags, and using loudspeakers to recite congratulatory messages to the registering students. Some classmates even played gongs and drums or waist drums to congratulate them. Hongda Middle School hung a giant banner more than three zhang long from the building and wrote on the exquisite registration forms: "Write down my determination to defend the motherland before the portrait of Chairman Mao." When classmates went to register, someone put red flowers on them and carried them around the classroom, receiving enthusiastic applause from the classmates. Tsinghua University, Peking University, Agricultural University, Jiaotong University, Beijing Railway Institute, and other schools held grand farewell parties immediately after the registration of the students was approved, and each class also held small farewell parties separately. The New Life Boys' Middle School Recommendation Committee invited students who had already registered and were preparing to register to a forum on the 4th. At the meeting, many students reported on their ideological struggles during registration. Shen Yunpu, the vice-principal of the school, reported how he encouraged his daughter to join a military cadre school last year and introduced her current study situation and the glory felt by the family, which gave great encouragement to the students who had already registered and those who had not yet registered. After Jiang Hongda, a member of the Communist Youth League of Huiwen Middle School, signed up to join the military cadre school, his father (a professor at the Agricultural University) wrote to encourage him, saying, "When the motherland and the Party need you, you resolutely go to the most glorious post, which is something to be proud of." After Fu Xiu, a junior high school student from Jingcun Girls' Middle School, registered, her mother made her new quilts and new clothes. Gao Yongkuan's father, Gao Zhiqing, from New Life Boys' Middle School, heard the news of the military cadre school's enrollment in Mentougou and specially rushed to the city to encourage his son to register. Some parents initially disagreed with their children's registration, but after being persuaded by their children, they also agreed. Sixteen students from Jingcun Girls' Middle School happily registered after persuading their parents. Most of the registered students are now stepping up their studies of politics and physical exercise. The Municipal No. 7 Middle School Recommendation Committee established a "Home of Glory" for registered students as a place for them to study and carry out cultural and recreational activities. The registered students of the school also made a covenant, guaranteeing to obey the organization's allocation, be prepared to endure hardship and hard work, and go to the place where the motherland needs them most.
