    Henan Xin'an and Pingyuan Huojia Counties
    Correct Deviations in the Donation Campaign
        (I)
    In some villages of Xin'an County, Henan Province, forced quotas appeared in the donation campaign. The Xin'an County Resist-America Aid-Korea Branch promptly corrected this situation after discovering it.
    The deviation in these villages' donation campaign was the failure to launch the masses and raise their political awareness, combining donation with the establishment of patriotic covenants and patriotic production increase plans. Instead, they adopted methods such as "self-reporting and public discussion" and "calculating the turn-over account," which were disguised forms of coercion. For example, in Siqu (Fourth District) Matou Village, village cadres called on the masses at a mass meeting to self-report the amount of donations. Middle peasant Zhang Changsheng reported donating 30 jin of wheat; many people said he donated too little, and as a result, he was publicly discussed and the amount was raised to 100 jin on the spot. Lei Tongya reported donating 30 jin of wheat and was discussed and raised to 80 jin. They were very dissatisfied with this. Lei Tongya said, "I didn't harvest much wheat this year and still owe people money. How can I give it?" Cai Zhuang in Sanqu (Third District) used a quota system. One peasant household of four people donated 25,000 yuan. The cadres said, "Think about how much land your family was allocated? In the old society, not to mention buying land, how much would it cost just to eat grain? Do you think donating this little money is enough?" Forcing peasants to donate more. Some peasants could only donate more at the time, but afterward worried about not being able to collect enough grain and regretted it very much.
    The Xin'an County Resist-America Aid-Korea Branch has now pointed out the above errors, raised cadres' understanding of the donation campaign, so that the donation campaign can be correctly carried out on the basis of raising the political awareness of the masses and increasing production.

  (II)
    The call by the Pingyuan Province Huojia County Resist-America Aid-Korea Branch for donations for a "Huojia" aircraft has been warmly responded to by the people of the county. The donation campaign has already had considerable success; the people of the county have full confidence in completing the donation for the "Huojia" aircraft.
    However, some deviations have also occurred in the donation campaign in individual areas of this county. Some village cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the great political significance of the donation campaign, have not actively mobilized the masses ideologically, so that the broad masses can further enhance their political awareness and understanding of the Resist-America Aid-Korea movement, and do a good job in the patriotic production increase competition movement to increase production and donate weapons; instead, they have a simple task viewpoint of donating for the sake of donating. Therefore, some of the masses do not understand the significance of the donation campaign. For example, some people in Xiyong'an Village discussed with each other: "If they tell us to donate, we'll just donate!"
    After discovering this situation, the Huojia County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Pingyuan Province has paid attention to educating cadres and correcting this deviation, so that the donation campaign can achieve greater success.
          Huojia County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Pingyuan Province, Li Ming
     Editor's Note: The production increase and donation campaign has been launched nationwide, and the broad masses of people have quickly become involved in this movement, actively contributing their strength to the motherland, and have raised their political awareness in the movement. The harvest is great. However, in a few areas, and among some cadres, some deviations have occurred. They have not explained the significance of increasing production and donating correctly and thoroughly to the masses, but have adopted simple command methods, simply pursuing numbers to "complete the task"; therefore, the result is bad. The leaders of Xin'an County, Henan, and Huojia County, Pingyuan, discovered this deviation in time and have made corrections, which is very necessary. It is hoped that other areas with this deviation will also conduct in-depth inspections and correct them in a timely manner.

    河南新安和平原获嘉两县
    纠正捐献运动中的偏向
        （一）
    河南省新安县某些乡村在捐献运动中发生强迫摊派偏向。新安县抗美援朝分会发现这个情况后，已及时予以纠正。
    这些乡村在捐献运动中的偏向是没有在发动群众、提高群众政治觉悟的基础上，结合订立爱国公约和爱国增产计划来进行捐献；而却采取了“自报公议”、“算翻身账”等变相强迫的办法。如四区马头乡村干部在群众大会上号召群众自报捐献数量。中农张长生自报捐献小麦三十斤；很多群众说他捐得太少，结果当场被议为一百斤。雷同亚自报捐献小麦三十斤，被议为八十斤。他们对此都很不满。雷同亚说：“我今年收麦不多，还欠人账，叫我怎么拿得出来？”三区蔡庄则用摊派办法。一户农民四口人捐献了二万五千元。干部说：“你想想，你家分了多少地？在旧社会，不用说买地，光吃粮食得多少钱？你看捐这点儿钱够吗？”强迫农民多捐。有些农民当时只得多捐献些；但过后又愁没法凑粮，很后悔。
    新安县抗美援朝分会现已指出上述错误，提高干部对捐献运动的认识，以使捐献运动在提高群众政治觉悟及增加生产的基础上正确地展开。

  （二）
    平原省获嘉县抗美援朝分会关于捐献“获嘉号”飞机的号召，已经得到全县人民的热烈响应。现在捐献运动已有了不小的成绩；全县人民有充分信心来完成“获嘉号”飞机的捐献。
    但是，本县个别地区在捐献运动中也发生了一些偏向。有些村干部对捐献运动的伟大政治意义认识不够，没有积极地从思想上发动群众，使广大群众更进一步提高政治觉悟和对抗美援朝运动的认识，搞好爱国主义丰产竞赛运动，增加生产捐献武器；而有着为捐献而捐献的单纯任务观点。因此，有些群众也就不了解捐献运动的意义。如西永安村有些群众互相议论：“叫我们捐，我们就捐吧！”
    中共平原省获嘉县委员会发现这个情况后，已注意对干部进行教育，纠正这一偏向，使捐献运动取得更大的成绩。
          中共平原省获嘉县委员会  黎明
     编者按：增产捐献运动已在全国范围内展开，广大人民迅速卷入这个运动中，对祖国积极地贡献了自己的力量，并在运动中提高了自己的政治觉悟，收获是很大的。但在少数地区，以及某些干部中，发生了一些偏向。他们没有把增产捐献的意义正确地、深入地向群众讲清楚，而采取了简单的命令的方法，单纯追求数字，来“完成任务”；因之，结果是坏的。河南新安县及平原获嘉县领导上及时发现了这个偏向，已进行了纠正，是很必要的。希望其他有此偏向的地区也进行深入的检查，及时加以纠正。
