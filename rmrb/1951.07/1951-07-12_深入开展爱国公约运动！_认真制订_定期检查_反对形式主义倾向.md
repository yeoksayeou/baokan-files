Editor's Note: The three successful examples of promoting the patriotic compact movement published in today's newspaper offer a common experience: Deepening the patriotic compact movement requires earnest inspection. Railway workers in Baoding established a Patriotic Compact Inspection Committee and compact inspection teams, the Jiang'an Inspection Section established a system of regular and random inspections, and the Tianjin Postal Administration delivery team inspected and revised the patriotic compact, and established a personal guarantee system for the realization of the compact. These methods are good and worthy of promotion. Regions or units that have established patriotic compacts should conduct a serious inspection. Inspecting the implementation of patriotic compacts will further enhance the ideological understanding of the masses, correct formalism, carry out mass criticism and self-criticism, and truly form a conscious patriotic compact movement.

Railway Workers in Baoding Region Carry Out Criticism and Improve Work Based on the Compact

　　The patriotic compact of railway workers in the Baoding region was formulated through democratic discussion based on the ideology of resisting America and aiding Korea and loving the country, and in response to the main problems in their work. In addition to the compacts of large factory and section units, 100 out of the 128 production teams in the entire region have formulated their own patriotic compacts. They universally wrote the compact of the entire section on the whitewashed walls, and 89 teams posted the compact in their workshops. The train crew teams even printed and distributed the compact, which had been discussed and revised twice, to each person to carry with them. The patriotic compact has become their action program and work target. According to the inspection of the Baoding Railway Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, 38 teams inspected and summarized their work according to the compact. The power station of the power section conducts criticism and self-criticism every week during the team meeting, based on the compact as the criterion. When the power section inspected the implementation of the compact, worker Wang Ruming became anxious when he saw that the item of saving raw materials had not yet been fulfilled, and he quickly mobilized everyone to think of ways. After two days of discussion, they shortened the high-voltage line by 200 meters and saved 17 meters of iron wire.

　　The leading role of Party members and the increased patriotic enthusiasm of workers and staff, as well as the formulation of various specific systems and methods, are a strong guarantee for the realization of the patriotic compact. The train work here was originally very chaotic, with crew assignments not according to schedule, and the whole team could not get together, could not hold meetings, and could not study, so the work naturally had no plan. After the establishment of the compact, everyone conducted practical discussions and decided to assign crews according to trade union teams and take turns on duty; each team would hold team meetings or study during off-duty hours. Since then, the state of disorganization has been overcome, ensuring that 563 trains had no accidents in May, exceeding the original plan by 25%; and preventing 19 cases of illegal transshipment and misuse of vehicles.

　　In the practice of the patriotic compact by railway workers in the Baoding region, the use of the weapon of criticism and self-criticism has also played an effective role. He Xishan and Wang Guocai of the power section used to be lax in their work, touching the transformer and leaving during inspections. Communist Party members Wang Ruming and Zhang Zhenhua actively took the lead in implementing the compact, which moved Wang Guocai. Wang said to He: "If you are not active in your work, you are letting down Chairman Mao. We made the compact. What's the point of just talking and not doing?" He Xishan reviewed himself, changed his work style, and changed his attitude of "touching and leaving" during inspection work to disassembling and overhauling the equipment, taking practical responsibility. Foreman Su Wanpeng also changed his shortcomings of drinking heavily and ignoring his work, and went to the site to lead the work.

　　According to the inspection of the Baoding Railway Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, there are still formalistic problems in the patriotic compact movement here. The loading and unloading unit has not yet established its own patriotic compact, but simply replaced the name of the Railway Bureau's compact with the name of the Baoding loading and unloading unit. Among the 18 units of the engineering section, only 5 units can be said to have their own "compact," but this "patriotic compact" was drafted by the administration, "passed" by the masses, and then put in a drawer. The other 13 teams simply regarded the original safety compact as the patriotic compact without any political content.

　　In order to promote the patriotic compact movement among railway workers in the Baoding region, in addition to calling on lower-level Party organizations and trade unions to seriously lead and universally mobilize the establishment of compacts, the Baoding Railway Party Committee of the Communist Party of China has also formulated several inspection systems. It requires the establishment of a Baoding Railway Workers' Patriotic Compact Inspection Committee, and each section should establish a compact inspection team, specifically responsible for inspecting the formulation and implementation of the compact, and promptly mobilizing the masses to supplement the content of the compact. In terms of specific methods, it stipulates that each inspection team should conduct inspections once a week and report the implementation of the compact by each production team to the regional inspection committee; the branch and trade union should go deep into the teams to provide specific help and solve the difficulties of each team in the implementation of the compact. Summaries should be reported at the end of each month; a reward and criticism system should be established for the establishment and implementation of the patriotic compact. Teams or individuals with outstanding achievements in implementing the compact should be promptly commended, and teams and individuals who do not implement or violate the compact should be advised, criticized by the team, and criticized on the blackboard or on the radio station. The above methods will be implemented by the masses in detail.

Jiang'an Inspection Section of Zhengzhou Railway Bureau Fully Discusses the Formulation of Compacts and Consciously Implements Them

　　The Jiang'an Inspection Section of the Hankou Branch of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration is a model for establishing and implementing patriotic compacts.

　　The section established a section-wide patriotic compact in late March. The compact includes supporting the Communist Party and the Central People's Government, supporting the Chinese People's Volunteers, doing a good job in patriotic competition to strive for over-fulfillment of production tasks, and strengthening safety and security work. Under the general patriotic compact of the entire section, each team formulated specific articles for the implementation of the patriotic compact by the team (i.e., the team's patriotic compact).

　　In the process of formulating and implementing the patriotic compact, the workers' political consciousness and production enthusiasm have been greatly improved. In order to implement the compact of "striving to over-fulfill production tasks," each team has established a system for studying technology. The mechanical team alone has created and improved more than ten kinds of tools in the past two months. The section's production task in May increased by 30.5% compared with February, but the actual output for the entire month still exceeded the original task by 37.1%, and the overall production efficiency increased by 80% compared with February. In order to implement the compact of "strengthening the picket team and protecting the safety of the factory," 70% of the young workers voluntarily requested to join the picket team. The picket team members produce during the day and patrol in shifts at night, never stopping even when it rains. When the returning representatives of the Volunteers came to Hankou, the entire section of workers enthusiastically launched a consolation and donation campaign, donating more than 3 million yuan in Renminbi. After the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea issued a call for donations of airplanes and artillery on June 1, the entire factory's workers enthusiastically responded, and proposed to volunteer one day of labor each month, donating all the wages earned.

　　The reason why the patriotic compact of this section has achieved good results is first and foremost because all the workers conducted full deliberation and discussion when establishing the compact, making the implementation of the patriotic compact truly a conscious action of every worker. The section's trade union first convened a joint meeting of team leaders to draft a draft patriotic compact, and then sent it to each team for repeated discussion and revision three times, obtaining the consent of all the workers in the section. When each team formulated the specific articles for the implementation of the patriotic compact by the team, it was only finally passed after obtaining the consent of every worker in the team. From these discussions, the erroneous understandings of some workers were corrected, and all the workers actively took action. For example, worker Zhang Zhichao of the mechanical team initially disagreed with the regulations on improving labor organization in the team's patriotic compact in order to gain more opportunities to learn technology. The team conducted repeated discussions, making him realize that personal interests should be combined with national interests. As a result, he not only made a written review to the trade union, but also became an active participant in the implementation of the patriotic compact. Secondly, when each team established the patriotic compact, they checked the work situation of the team and put forward requirements based on the current urgent problems that needed to be solved. Therefore, the content of the compact was practical and specific, and the effect was very great after implementation. For example, the sawmill team used to have too many people and too little sawing, wasting labor and failing to complete tasks on time. They stipulated in the patriotic compact that the whole team should be divided into day and night shifts, "resting people and not resting horses" (referring to two shifts of people working in shifts without stopping the machines). As a result, they completed 35 days of work in 28 days, ensuring the timely supply of wood. For another example, the materials room always failed to balance the accounts in the past, hindering the timely calculation of costs. They stipulated in the patriotic compact "accounts should be settled on the same day." Now they settle the accounts and send them to the accounting room at 6 pm every day.

　　In order to ensure the realization of the patriotic compact, the section's trade union established a bi-monthly inspection system. Each team conducts regular inspections two to four times a month, and also conducts random inspections at any time, publishing the inspection results on blackboards and big-character posters. The trade union connects the patriotic compact to every joint meeting of team leaders and when arranging work, calling on workers to earnestly implement it. They also write the articles of the patriotic compact in every eye-catching place, so that workers can see it at any time.

Tianjin Postal Administration Delivery Team's Compact Revised to Be Specific, Easy to Implement, and Highly Effective

　　The staff of the Tianjin Postal Administration Delivery Team (the delivery team is divided into four teams) has basically eliminated errors in their work and greatly increased the number of newspaper and magazine publications due to the specific and easily implemented patriotic compact they established. In May, the team handled an increase of 6,368 newspaper subscribers, an increase of 3,185 subscribers to four major publications such as Current Affairs Manuals, and an increase of more than 10,000 copies of retail newspapers and magazines. Because of the good work performance, the team has received three pennants awarded by the administration and the trade union and presented by Tianjin Daily.

　　The patriotic compacts established by the team in the past were mostly political slogans, which were difficult to implement and difficult to inspect. Therefore, they made a revision in May. When revising, they tried to make the articles specific and easy to implement based on the team's business situation. For example, they changed "Distributing one more newspaper is adding one more point to resist America and aid Korea" to "Developing newspaper subscribers from house to house and consolidating the original number of newspaper subscriptions." In order to eliminate errors in the delivery of letters and publications and adhere to administrative systems, they stipulated "Do not deliver without re-examination, do not deliver without re-verification, do not deliver without an answer, and do not delay once," as well as "Be on time for work, be on time for departure, stamp the name stamp accurately, record the actual number accurately, and sign the point of return to the office." In addition, they also stipulated "Do not be absent from cultural studies and insist on reading the newspaper for 15 minutes every day," so that their political and cultural level can be continuously improved and their work enthusiasm can be maintained.

　　After the patriotic compact was revised, all the delivery personnel of the team actively implemented it. They came up with many ways to increase the number of newspaper and magazine publications. For example, Meng Zhaoliang and Yang Maolin discovered that the traders at the Jincheng Grain Exchange often bought newspapers to read, so they promoted the benefits of subscribing to newspapers to these people, and therefore subscribed to more than 30 newspapers. They also promoted this method to tobacco, oil, and grain exchanges, and also subscribed to many newspapers. The delivery staff also used the time to deliver letters to promote the importance of resisting America and aiding Korea and studying current affairs to residents, and helped citizens organize newspaper reading groups to subscribe to newspapers jointly based on the economic situation and reading ability of residents. In order to ensure that they arrived at the bureau on time, the delivery personnel promoted the spirit of mutual assistance and changed the past phenomenon of uneven workload.

　　In order to ensure the earnest implementation of the patriotic compact, the team established a "Personal Work Registration Card" system. Everyone fills in the number of operations and errors on the card every day; review meetings are held once a week based on the card; the trade union's cultural and educational committee also cooperates with the team leader to inspect once every two weeks.

### 深入开展爱国公约运动！  认真制订·定期检查·反对形式主义倾向

　　深入开展爱国公约运动！
    认真制订·定期检查·反对形式主义倾向
    编者按：今日本报发表的三个有关推行爱国公约运动成功的例子，提供了一个共同的经验：深入开展爱国公约运动必须认真地进行检查。保定铁路职工成立爱国公约检查委员会及公约检查小组，江岸检车段建立了定期检查和抽查制度，天津邮政管理局投递组检查修订了爱国公约，并建立了个人保证实现公约的制度。这些办法都是好的，值得推广。已订立爱国公约的地区或单位应认真进行一次检查。检查爱国公约的执行，将会进一步提高群众思想认识，纠正形式主义，开展群众性的批评和自我批评，真正形成一个自觉的爱国公约运动。
  保定地区铁路职工依据公约开展批评改进工作
    保定地区铁路职工的爱国公约，是在抗美援朝热爱祖国的思想基础上，针对工作中的主要问题，经过民主讨论制订出来的。除厂段大单位公约外，全区一百二十八个生产小组中，有一百个小组订了自己的爱国公约。他们把全段公约普遍地书写在用白灰涂过的粉墙上，八十九个小组把公约贴在自己的车间，列车所小组更把经两次讨论修改的公约，印发每人一份，随身携带。爱国公约成了他们的行动纲领和工作标的。据中国共产党保定铁路党委会的检查，有三十八个小组按公约检查和总结了他们的工作。电力段电力站每星期晚上开小组会时，都是以公约为准则进行批评和自我批评。电力段当检查公约执行情况时，工人王汝明见节省原料一条还没办到，他着了急，赶紧动员大家想办法。大家经过两天讨论，把高压线缩短了二百公尺，并节省铁线十七公尺。
    党员带头和工人职员爱国热情的提高，各种具体制度和办法的制订，是实现爱国公约的有力保证。这里的列车工作原来很乱，派乘不按班，全组全班的人凑不到一块，不能开会，也不能学习，工作自然也就没有计划。订立公约后，大家进行了切实的讨论，决定按工会小组出乘，轮流值班；各组休班时开小组会或进行学习。从此克服了无组织状态，保证了五月份五百六十三个列车无事故，超过原订计划百分之二十五；并防止了十九件违法转运、误用车辆的事件。
    保定地区铁路职工实践爱国公约中，批评与自我批评武器的运用，也起了有效的作用。电力段的何西山和王国财过去工作松懈，检查变压器时一摸就走。同组的共产党员王汝明、张振华积极带头执行公约，感动了王国财。王向何说：“你工作再不积极，对不起毛主席了，公约是咱们订的，光说不做，那算什么？”何西山检讨了自己，转变了工作作风，做检查工作时改变了“一摸就走”的态度，变为大拆大卸，切实负责。领工苏万鹏也改变了喝大酒不顾工作的缺点，亲到现场领导工作。
    据中国共产党保定地区铁路党委会检查，这里在爱国公约运动中也还有形式主义的毛病。装卸单位到现在还没订立自己的爱国公约，只是把铁路局的公约换上了保定装卸单位的名字。工务段十八个单位中，只有五个单位算有了自己的“公约”，但这个“爱国公约”是由行政方面拟定，在群众中“通过”了一下，就放在抽屉里了。其他十三个组，把原来的安全公约原封不动地当成了爱国公约，根本没有政治内容。
    为在保定地区铁路职工中推广爱国公约运动，中国共产党保定地区铁路党委除号召下级党组织和工会认真领导，普遍发动订立以外，特别又制订了几项检查制度。要求建立保定地区铁路职工爱国公约检查委员会，各段设立公约检查小组，专门负责检查公约制定与执行情况，及时发动群众补修公约内容。在具体办法上规定：各检查小组每周检查一次，将各生产小组执行公约情况报告给地区检查委员会；支部与工会深入小组具体帮助，解决各组在公约执行中的困难。每月底总结上报；建立订立与执行爱国公约的奖励与批评制度，对执行公约成绩优越的小组或个人，及时表扬，对不执行或违犯公约的小组和个人，分别进行劝告，小组批评与登黑板报或在广播台广播批评。以上办法都将通过群众具体执行。

  郑州铁路局江岸检车段充分讨论制订公约自觉执行
    郑州铁路管理局汉口分局江岸检车段是订立和执行爱国公约的范例。
    该段在三月下旬就订立了全段的爱国公约。公约内容包括拥护共产党和中央人民政府、支援中国人民志愿军、搞好爱国竞赛争取超额完成生产任务、加强安全保卫工作等。在全段总的爱国公约下，各组都拟订了本组执行爱国公约的具体条文（即小组爱国公约）。
    在爱国公约的制订和执行的过程中工人的政治觉悟和生产积极性都大为提高。为了执行“争取超额完成生产任务”的公约，各组都建立起研究技术的制度，仅机械组两个月来就创造和改进工具十余种。全段五月份的生产任务较二月份增加了百分之三十点五，但全月实际产量仍超过原订任务的百分之三十七点一，总的生产效率较二月份提高了百分之八十。为了执行“加强纠察队，保卫工厂安全”的公约，有百分之七十的青年工人自动要求参加纠察队。纠察队员们白天生产，夜间轮流巡逻，即使下雨也从不停止。当志愿军归国代表来汉时，全段职工热烈展开慰劳和捐献运动，共捐出人民币三百余万元。六月一日中国人民抗美援朝总会发出捐献飞机大炮的号召后，全厂职工热烈响应，纷纷提出每月义务劳动一日，将所得工资全部捐献。
    该段的爱国公约收到很好效果的原因，首先是由于在订立公约时全体职工进行了充分酝酿和讨论，使执行爱国公约真正成为每个工人的自觉的行动。该段工会先召开了小组长联席会拟出爱国公约草案，然后发到各小组反复进行了三次讨论和修改，得到全段工人的同意。各小组在拟制本组执行爱国公约的具体条文时，也是直到征得全组每一个工人的同意，才最后通过。从这些讨论中，部分工人的错误认识纠正过来了，全体工人都积极行动起来。如机械组工人张志超，开始为使自己多得一些学习技术的机会，不同意小组爱国公约中改进劳动组织的规定。小组就作了反复讨论，使他认识到个人利益应和国家利益结合起来。结果他不仅向工会作了书面检讨，而且成为执行爱国公约的积极分子。其次，各小组在订立爱国公约时，都检查了本组的工作情况，根据当前迫切需要解决的问题提出要求，因之公约内容切实具体，执行以后成效很大。如锯木组过去人多锯少，浪费了劳动力又不能按时完成任务，他们就在爱国公约中规定，全组分为日夜两班，“歇人不歇马”（指两班人轮流工作，不停机器），结果在二十八天内就完成了三十五天的工作，保证了木料的及时供应。又如材料室过去总是结不出账来，妨碍及时计算成本，他们就在爱国公约中规定“当天账目当天算完”。现在每天下午六点钟他们就把账目算好送到会计室。
    为了保证爱国公约的实现，该段工会建立了每月两次的检查制度。各小组则除每月定期检查两次到四次外，并进行随时抽查，将检查结果在黑板报、大字报上发表。工会在每次小组长联席会及布置工作时，都联系到爱国公约，号召工人认真执行。他们并把爱国公约的条文写到每一个引人注意的地方，使工人们随时都可以看到。

  天津邮政管理局投递组公约修订后具体易行效果大
    天津邮政管理局投递组（投递组共分四个小组）职工，由于订的爱国公约具体易行，已使工作中的差错基本上消灭，报刊发行数量激增。五月份该组经手的报纸订户增加六千三百六十八户，时事手册等四种主要书刊订户增加三千一百八十五户，零售报刊数量增加一万多份。因为工作成绩好，该组已得到行政、工会奖给的和天津日报赠送的锦旗三面。
    该组过去订的爱国公约多半是政治口号，很难执行，也很难检查。因此他们在五月间作了一次修订。修订时，他们根据本组业务情况，尽量使条文具体易行。如他们把“多发行一份报纸就是多增加一分抗美援朝的力量”，改订为“挨户发展报纸订户，巩固原有订报份数”。为了消灭投递信件和书刊中的差错，坚持行政制度，他们订出“不复问不退、不复核不投、不叫应不投、不延误一次”以及“准时上班、准时出局、准盖名戳、准记实数、回局签准点”。此外，他们还订了“文化学习不旷课，每日坚持读报十五分钟”等项，使他们的政治、文化水平能不断地提高，工作热情得以经常保持。
    爱国公约修订以后，全组投递人员都积极地去执行。他们想了许多办法去增加报刊发行数量。如孟昭良、杨茂林发现金城粮食交易所的交易人员，时常买报看，就向这些人宣传订报的好处，因而订出报纸三十多份。他们又把这种办法向烟草、油粮等交易所推行，也订出不少份报纸。投递员们并利用投递信件的时间，向住户宣传抗美援朝及学习时事的重要性，根据住户的经济及读报能力，帮助市民组织读报小组合订报纸。为了保证准时到局，投递员们发扬了互助精神，改变了过去忙闲不匀的现象。
    为了保证爱国公约的认真执行，该组建立了“个人工作登记卡片”制度。每人每天把自己作业的数量、差错等填在卡片上；每周根据卡片开检讨会一次；工会文教委员又协同小组长每两周检查一次。
