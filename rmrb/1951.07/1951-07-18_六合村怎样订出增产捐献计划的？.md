How Liuhe Village Formulated its Increased Production Donation Plan?

Liuhe Village in Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province, after sufficient publicity and deliberation, formulated an increased production donation plan centered on the patriotic production increase movement, combined with checking preferential treatment work and revising the patriotic pact.

When Liuhe Village launched the donation of airplanes and cannons movement in early June, it first organized all the Communist Party members, cadres, propagandists, and Communist Youth League members in the village to carry out propaganda household by household and person by person in production teams, during work, and during breaks. At the same time, it organized two teachers and senior students with propaganda ability to promote to family members and neighbors; it also summoned production team leaders in the village to conduct education and mobilize them to participate in propaganda work; in addition, it also posted political mobilization slogans and screened "local movies." The propaganda mainly talked about the great victory of the Fifth Battle on the Korean battlefield in annihilating more than 46,000 enemies and the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, and then turned to why donate airplanes and cannons, how to donate, etc. Through propaganda, the masses' awareness was raised, the incorrect understanding of some people about the donation movement was corrected, and the concerns of some of the masses were dispelled. The masses of the whole village consciously and voluntarily invested in the donation movement (159 out of 166 households participated in the donation).

After the propaganda mobilization, the village's CCP branch specifically led labor model Jiang Rong's mutual aid team, women's representative Wang Rong, and others to first check the original production increase plan and, based on possible conditions, formulate a donation plan to increase production and increase income, and propose a competition with the whole village. Subsequently, all 35 mutual aid teams in the village supplemented and revised the original production increase plan to increase yields by increasing hoeing and fertilizing. Many masses also proposed to engage in more sideline occupations, pick up crops after autumn, dedicate labor, and save money, based on their own actual conditions, and formulated their own increased production donation plans. These plans were carefully calculated by the masses and were practical and feasible.

Concentrating the plans of the masses of the whole village, the total value of the donations is about nearly 15 million yuan. These include: (1) Of the 728 hectares of land in the village, 68 hectares are planned to increase seedling manure; 362 hectares are planned to increase the number of hoeing, which can increase grain production by about 90 shi. Some donate part of the increased production, and some donate all of the increased production, totaling 50 shi of grain. (2) Women, children, the elderly, etc., plan to go to the fields to pick up crops during the autumn harvest and donate part or all of them, donating a total of five shi of grain. (3) Engage in more sideline production. There are 27 items, including grass cutting, fishing, weaving straw hats, raising more pigs, and raising chickens, with a total donation value of over 800,000 yuan. In addition, some of the masses plan to donate by dedicating labor or reducing waste.

During the donation movement, the village also checked the cultivated land of military dependents by village, and then held a forum for military dependents to solicit their opinions, help them solve difficulties, and improve the work of cultivating on their behalf. Finally, the masses of the whole village were mobilized from individuals to groups to the whole village to formulate a patriotic pact (the village originally had a patriotic pact for the whole village, but the content was not practical, so it was revised), and the donation work and the preferential treatment work were included in the patriotic pact. The whole village also elected a seven-person patriotic pact implementation and inspection committee, with the village chief and the CCP branch secretary as the director and deputy director respectively, to regularly supervise and inspect to ensure its realization.

　　六合村怎样订出增产捐献计划的？
    黑龙江省绥化县六合村，经过充分的宣传、酝酿之后，围绕爱国丰产运动，结合检查优抚工作和修订爱国公约，订出了增产捐献计划。
    六合村在六月初发动捐献飞机大炮运动时，首先组织了全村的共产党员、干部、宣传员和青年团员，以生产小组为单位，在干活中间，在休息时间，挨户挨人进行了宣传。同时又组织了两名教员和有宣传能力的高年级学生，向家里人和邻居宣传；又以屯为单位，召集生产小组长进行了教育，动员他们参加了宣传工作；此外，还张贴了政治鼓动标语，放映了“土电影”。宣传时主要讲朝鲜战场上第五次战役歼敌四万六千余人的伟大胜利与和平解放西藏问题的获得协议，然后转入为什么要捐献飞机大炮，怎样捐献等。通过宣传，提高了群众的觉悟，纠正了某些人对捐献运动的不正确的认识，解除了部分群众的顾虑。全村群众都自觉自愿地投入了捐献运动（一百六十六户中，参加捐献的有一百五十九户）。
    宣传动员之后，该村中共支部又具体领导劳动模范姜荣互助组、妇女代表王荣等，首先检查了原有的丰产计划，根据可能的条件，订出增加生产、增加收入的捐献计划，并提出和全村竞赛。接着全村三十五个互助组都补充和修改了原来的丰产计划，以增加铲趟，多施肥等办法提高产量。还有许多群众根据自己的实际情况，提出多搞副业、秋后拾庄稼、献工、节约等办法，订出了自己的增产捐献计划。这些计划，都是经过群众精打细算的，是切实可行的。
    集中全村群众的计划，捐献的总值约近一千五百万元。其中包括：（一）全村七百二十八垧地，有六十八垧计划增加苗粪；三百六十二垧增加铲趟遍数，共可增产粮食九十石左右，有的捐献增产的一部，有的捐献增产的全部，共计捐献粮食五十石。（二）妇女、儿童、老年人等，计划秋收时下地拾庄稼，捐出一部或全部，共认捐了五石粮食。（三）多搞副业生产。计有打草、打鱼、编草帽、多养猪、养鸡等二十七项，认捐总值在八十万元以上。此外，还有部分群众计划以献工或减少浪费来捐献。
    在捐献运动中，该村又以屯为单位，检查了军属的代耕地，然后召开军属座谈会，征求军属意见，帮助他们解决困难，改进了代耕工作。最后，又发动全村群众从个人到小组到全村，订立了爱国公约（该村原有全村的爱国公约，但内容不切实际，故重新修订），把捐献工作和优抚工作都列入了爱国公约。全村并推选七人组成了爱国公约执行检查委员会，由村长与中共支部书记任正副主任，经常督促检查，以保证其实现。
