　　Workers Overcome Mountain Floods in Rainy Rush Repairs
    Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Opens to Yongchuan on "July 1st" as Scheduled
    Nanchang Railway Branch Bridge Engineering Team Creates New Record
    The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway opened to Yongchuan from Chongqing on "July 1st" as scheduled. In early June, the employees of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway proposed a guarantee to build the road to Yongchuan by July 1st to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. On June 26, when the rails were laid to a place two kilometers away from Yongchuan, it suddenly rained heavily, and more than 1,600 cubic meters of the roadbed were washed away by the rain. The workers immediately rushed to repair it overnight in the rain, vowing: "Even if it rains knives, I have to repair the road." They worked continuously for two days and two nights, finally overcoming the mountain floods, and the rails were laid to Yongchuan on schedule on the eve of "July 1st". At this point, the 165-kilometer section from Chongqing to Yongchuan is fully open to traffic.

    The Nanchang Branch Bridge Engineering Team of the Shanghai Railway Bureau, on the eve of "July 1st," set a new national record of replacing a bridge span in ten minutes while constructing the Fuhe Bridge. This record broke the team's national record of eighteen minutes set in February this year. The bridge engineering team specially wrote a letter to Chairman Mao to report this as a gift to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.

　　工人冒雨抢修战胜山洪
    成渝路“七一”如期通至永川
    南昌铁路分局桥工队创新纪录
    成渝铁路如期于“七一”由重庆通车到永川。六月初，成渝路职工就提出保证，要在七月一日把路修到永川，来庆祝中国共产党诞生三十周年。六月二十六日，车轨铺到距永川两公里的地方，突然下起暴雨来，路基被雨水冲塌了一千六百多公方。工人们立刻冒雨连夜抢修，他们发誓：“你下刀子，我也得把路修好。”这样连续工作了两天两夜，终于战胜了山洪，车轨如期在“七一”前夕铺到了永川。至此，重庆至永川一百六十五公里即完全通车。

    上海铁路局南昌分局桥工队，在“七一”前夕，修建抚河大桥中，创十分钟换一孔桥梁的全国最新纪录。此一纪录突破了该队今年二月创造的十八分钟的全国纪录。该桥工队特写信报告毛主席以此作为中国共产党成立三十周年纪念的献礼。
