As a member of the Central Southwest Visiting Group:

Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups, Tibet has been able to break free from the shackles and oppression of reactionary forces at home and abroad, and return to the fraternal and cooperative family of the motherland. This is the starting point for Tibetan compatriots to move from darkness and suffering towards brightness and happiness.

For a long historical period, the Tibetan people were subjected to the enslavement, oppression, and exploitation of successive feudal reactionary governments in China. In the past century, British and American imperialism also invaded Tibet one after another, carrying out frenzied plundering and extraction, plunging our Tibetan compatriots into the abyss of suffering. The oppression and enslavement of Tibetan compatriots by reactionary forces at home and abroad was carried out simultaneously in the political, military, economic, and cultural spheres. Now, I will briefly describe the economic exploitation and extraction.

  The "Using Tea to Govern the Border" Policy of Successive Feudal Rulers

The Kangzang Plateau is a world-famous plateau, with an average altitude of over 3,000 meters. The air is thin, the climate is dry, and the moisture in the human body evaporates quickly, causing constant thirst; at the same time, because Tibetan compatriots mainly eat beef, mutton, and zanba, they often experience digestive difficulties. Therefore, drinking tea has become a habit, and tea has become an indispensable necessity of life. Successive feudal rulers, seeing this point, implemented comprehensive control over tea from production, manufacturing, and sales, using tea to exert economic and even political control over Tibetan compatriots. The "Tea-Horse Law," "Tea Monopoly System," and "Tea Permit System" and other decrees that controlled border tea trade were all infused with the reactionary policy of "using tea to govern the border" and enslaving Tibetans. In order to seize horses from brotherly ethnic regions to enrich military equipment, the feudal emperors of the Song Dynasty ordered the establishment of large-scale "Tea-Horse Offices" dedicated to "exchanging" tea for horses. At that time, it was stipulated that all civilian tea in Sichuan and Shaanxi should be bought by the government, and people were not allowed to trade privately. Liu Liangqing, a censor in the Ming Dynasty, said even more fiercely: "The Tibetans rely on tea for their livelihood, so strict laws are used to prohibit it, and horses are exchanged to reward them, in order to control the lifeblood of the Tibetans." Therefore, the Ming Dynasty added "Tea-Horse Office" institutions to the southwestern and northwestern borders to expand the scope of control.

The Qing Dynasty not only did not relax control over border tea trade, but also made the laws stricter. During the Qianlong period, it was stipulated that tea merchants registered and approved by the government should pay taxes to purchase tea and sell it to Tibetan areas. Tea farmers could only sell tea to designated tea merchants and could not sell it privately; tea merchants could not sell tea beyond the prescribed quantity. Tea farmers and tea merchants who violated the law were not only subject to confiscation of the price, but also to the death penalty in severe cases, and deportation to the army or flogging in minor cases.

  The Kuomintang Reactionary Government Was Even More Ferocious Than the Feudal Dynasties

After the Kuomintang reactionary government officially established Xikang Province in 1939, the first priority was to establish the Kangzang Tea Company, manipulated by bureaucratic capital, to implement official purchase, official production, official transportation, and official sale of all the tea needed by Kangzang compatriots. It purchased tea at low prices, exploiting tea farmers; monopolized the manufacture of tea packages, merging legitimate tea merchants; and cruelly exploited Tibetans to obtain high profits. As a result, tea farmers were forced to "cut and hoe tea plants, seeking distant exploitation" (see the document submitted by tea farmers to the pseudo-Xikang Provincial Government in 1940). Tea workers cut corners and produced inferior products. Although Tibetan compatriots paid high prices, they could only buy "bitter tea." At that time, the Kangqing inspection group organized by the Kuomintang reactionary government itself had to admit that after the establishment of the Kangzang Tea Company, "tea prices were high, the people of Kangzang resented it, and their feelings deteriorated," and that they even wanted to cut off trade with the Han people. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, prices soared and the pseudo-currency depreciated, putting the border tea industry, on which hundreds of thousands of tea farmers depended for their livelihoods, in dire straits. In 1949, the year before the liberation of Xikang, only 170,000 packages of Xikang border tea were produced. Due to the poor security situation and the indistinguishable division between soldiers and bandits, only half of them were actually sold to Tibetans. Compared with the 540,000 packages limited to annual sales by the Qing government, this was a drop of several times. In order to ensure the monopoly of tea, reactionary governments in history, in addition to implementing a policy of unified purchase and sales, also strictly prohibited the import of tea tree seedlings into Tibetan areas. Therefore, in the Han areas east of Erlang Mountain and Daxiang Ridge, tea bushes were everywhere; while on the west side of the mountains, there had never been tea trees.

  The People's Era Has Begun!

Last year, when the People's Liberation Army arrived in Xikang, the Communist Party and the People's Government immediately announced a policy of restoring and developing tea production, encouraging tea planting, and increasing the purchase price of raw tea, so that tea farmers generally benefited. At the same time, loans were given to legitimate tea merchants to vigorously develop tea production, purchase stored tea, and rush it to Kangding for timely supply to Tibetan compatriots. Last November, the People's Government of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province was declared established in Kangding, and vigorously planting tea trees in the Tibetan area was listed as one of the central tasks. When the Tibetan people heard this news, they immediately smiled and cheered. When the Liberation Army arrived in Xikang and continued to march towards the Kangzang Plateau, Tibetan compatriots erected a paifang (decorative archway) with four large wooden pillars on the top of Erlang Mountain, with the words "Connecting Kangzang" written on the paifang, to welcome the Liberation Army to Kangzang to liberate all Tibetan compatriots. Today, Erlang Mountain has indeed become the road "connecting Kangzang," no longer a blockade line. Under the illumination of Chairman Mao's ethnic policy and trade policy, the tea needed by Tibetan compatriots will be continuously transported westward through this road and fully supplied without any restrictions. Tea seedlings will also be planted and propagated in the vast Tibetan areas, fundamentally satisfying the needs of the Tibetan people themselves.

After the liberation of Kangding, in order to open up the sales channels for Tibetan people's local products that had been shrinking for many years, the Xikang Provincial Trade Company used tea packages rushed to Kangding to fairly exchange for Tibetan people's local medicinal materials. The prices of local products were reasonably and gradually increased, and the prices of tea packages were reasonably and steadily reduced, so that the economic interests of the Tibetan people were appropriately taken care of. Taking musk as an example, when it was first liberated in June last year, one liang (a unit of weight) could be exchanged for 1.1 packages of tea, but by the end of last year, it had increased to 5 packages of tea. During the same period, wool also increased from 2.6 packages of tea per dan (another unit of weight) to 7 packages of tea. These measures made the Tibetan people realize that the trade company under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government was completely different from the Kangzang Tea Company of the Kuomintang reactionary government. Therefore, Tibetan compatriots everywhere sang such songs: "The Liberation Army is coming soon, bringing a trade company with them, and the trade company is bringing tea packages!"

  The End of Imperialist Aggression

As early as the second half of the 18th century, British imperialism began to invade our Tibet, forcibly occupying the Chumbi Valley and forcing the opening of the Yatung trading port. In 1904, it even occupied Lhasa for a time, forcing the Qing government to abolish customs posts and allow British goods to be imported, all tax-free. At the same time, Indian tea, along with the military and political aggression of British imperialism, freely entered and was heavily promoted.

During the Anti-Japanese War, the economy in the areas ruled by the Kuomintang reactionary government was extremely chaotic, and goods from British and American imperialism were continuously dumped from the back door of Tibet. Before the liberation of Kangding and Garze last year, the market was full of British and American broadcloth, khaki, cosmetics, and high-grade cigarettes, as well as so-called surplus materials from American imperialism, such as military呢 coats, mercerized khaki, milk powder, chewing gum, and machetes, much like the foreign concessions in Shanghai before liberation.

With the victorious advance of the People's Liberation Army, the rule of imperialism here was overthrown. But like other cities across the country, false purchasing power disappeared when the currency initially stabilized after liberation. The goods accumulated by Tibetan industrialists and merchants, especially high-end consumer goods from imperialism, could not be sold, funds could not be circulated, and commerce came to a standstill. Seeing this situation, the People's Government actively sought ways to purchase these unsold goods, so that the Tibetan people's funds could be circulated; strengthened the transportation of local products, and promoted the exchange of materials between Han and Tibet. These measures made the Tibetan people realize the benefits of the People's Government even more, and thus they became increasingly fond of the people's motherland.

The reactionary policy of "using tea to govern the border" has ended, and the reactionary rule of imperialism is about to end completely. In the Tibetan areas of Xikang Province, which were liberated earlier last year, the Tibetan people's own autonomous government has been established. The Tibetan compatriots have stood up for the first time in history to be masters of their own destiny, and have obtained the happiness and joy of being masters in the great family of the People's Republic of China. No one dares to deceive, exploit, or oppress them anymore. Their local products have sales channels and reasonable prices, and at the same time, they have cheap tea and can grow tea themselves. Therefore, they deeply appreciate Chairman Mao, appreciate the Communist Party, sing the praises of Chairman Mao, and sing the praises of the Communist Party. Now, the Tibetan people say to everyone they meet: "Chairman Mao is the living Buddha." "Chairman Mao is the savior of the Tibetan people." Many kind Tibetan religious believers are reciting the Longevity Sutra for Chairman Mao!

　　藏汉贸易关系的历史性大转变
    中央西南访问团团员  马志柏
    在中国各族人民伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，西藏已可能挣脱了国内外反动派的羁绊和压迫，回到祖国友爱合作的大家庭来。这是藏族同胞从黑暗和痛苦走向光明和幸福的起点。
    在很长的历史时期中，西藏民族是处在中国历代封建反动政府的奴役、压迫、剥削下面的。近百年来，英美帝国主义也先后侵入西藏，实行疯狂掠夺和榨取，使我藏族同胞陷于水深火热的痛苦深渊。内外反动派对藏族同胞的压迫奴役，是政治、军事、经济、文化各方面同时进行的。现在仅就经济上的剥削榨取略加叙述。
  历代封建统治者的“以茶治边”政策
    康藏高原是世界有名的高原，海拔平均在三千公尺以上。空气稀薄，气候干燥，人体内水分蒸发很快，时时感觉干渴；同时，因藏族同胞以牛羊肉和糌粑为主要食品，常感消化困难，因此饮茶成习，茶叶成了不可或缺的生活必需品。历代封建统治者看到这一点，就把茶叶从生产、制造和运销各方面施行全面统制，通过茶叶来对藏族同胞实行经济上以至政治上的控制。在“茶马法”、“榷茶制”、“引茶制”等统制边茶贸易的法令里，都贯注了“以茶治边”、奴役藏族的反动政策。宋代封建帝王为夺取兄弟民族区域的马匹，充实军备，曾下令设立规模庞大的“茶马司”，专门以茶“交换”马匹。当时规定川峡民茶尽买入官，不准人民私行交易。明代御史刘良卿更狠狠地说：“番人恃茶以生，故严法以禁之，易马以酬之，以制番人之死命。”所以明代更于西南西北边境添设“茶马司”机构，扩大控制范围。
    满清一代，对于边茶贸易非但没有放松统制，且立法更严。乾隆年间，曾规定由登记核准的茶商向政府缴税购茶卖往藏区，茶农只能将茶售给指定的茶商，不能私卖；茶商贩茶也不能超出规定数量。茶农茶商如有违反法令情事，除没收价款外，重则死刑，轻则押发充军或鞭打。
        国民党反动政府比封建王朝还凶狠
    国民党反动政府于一九三九年正式建立西康省后，第一个首要任务便是设立由官僚资本操纵的康藏茶叶公司，把康藏同胞需要的茶叶全部实行官收、官制、官运、官卖。它贱价统购茶叶，剥削茶农；独家制造茶包，兼并正当茶商；残酷剥削藏胞，获取高利。这样一来，茶农被迫“砍锄茶株，借远剥削之媒”（见一九四○年茶农呈伪西康省政府文）。茶工则偷工减料，粗制滥造，藏族同胞虽出高价，也只能买到“苦茶”。当时国民党反动政府自己组织的康青视察团，也不得不承认康藏茶叶公司成立后是“茶价高昂，康藏人民怨恨，感情日乖”，“并欲与汉人断绝交易”。抗日战争胜利后，物价飞涨，伪币贬值，更把数十万茶农依以为生的边茶事业弄得山穷水尽，陷入绝路。在西康解放的前一年，即一九四九年，西康边茶只制造了十七万包。而由于当时兵匪不分，治安不好，实际售给藏胞的还只及半数。以此与满清政府限制年销五十四万包相比，跌了好几倍。历史上反动政府为确保茶叶的垄断专卖，除实行统购统销政策外，还严格禁止茶树种苗输入藏族区域。因此，在二郎山和大相岭之东的汉人地区是茶丛遍野；而在山之西，就从来没有茶树。
  人民的时代开始了！
    去年，人民解放军到了西康，共产党和人民政府马上宣布恢复和发展茶叶生产的政策，奖励种茶植茶，提高毛茶收购价格，使茶农普遍获得益处。同时贷款给正当茶商，大力展开制茶，并收购存茶，赶运康定，及时供应藏族同胞。去年十一月，西康省藏族自治区域人民政府在康定宣告成立，便把在藏族区大力栽种茶树列为中心任务之一。藏族人民听到这一消息，马上喜笑颜开，欢声雷动。解放大军到了西康，继续向康藏高原进军时，藏族同胞便在二郎山巅用四根大木柱竖立了一座牌坊，牌坊上写了“贯通康藏”四个大字，欢迎解放军前往康藏解放全体西藏同胞。今天的二郎山，确实成了“贯通康藏”的大道，不再是封锁线了。在毛主席的民族政策贸易政策的照耀下，藏族同胞所需要的茶叶，将源源经此西运，充分供应，不再受一点限制了。茶叶种苗也将在广大的藏族区域内栽种繁殖，从根本上满足藏族人民自己的需要。
    康定解放后，西康省贸易公司为打开萎缩多年的藏族人民的土产销路，就用赶运到康定的茶包公平交换藏族人民的土产药材。土产价格合理地逐步提高，茶包价格合理地步步减低，使藏族人民的经济利益得到适当照顾。以麝香为例，去年六月份刚解放时每两换茶一·一包，去年底即增加到换茶五包。同一期间，羊毛也由每担换茶二·六包增加到换茶七包。这些措施，使藏族人民认识到共产党和人民政府领导下的贸易公司，和国民党反动政府的康藏茶叶公司完全不同。因此，藏族同胞到处唱出这样的歌声：“解放军快快来，来了带个贸易公司来，贸易公司带了茶包来！”
  英美帝国主义侵略的结束
    远在十八世纪后半期，英帝国主义就开始侵入我们的西藏地方，强占春丕河谷，逼开亚东商埠。至一九○四年，更一度侵占拉萨。迫使满清政府撤销关卡，让英货进口，一律免税。与此同时，印度茶即随着英帝国主义的军事政治侵略，自由入口，大肆推销。
    抗日战争期间，国民党反动政府统治地区经济极度混乱，美英帝国主义的商品便源源不绝地自西藏后门倾销而来。在去年康定和甘孜解放之前，市场上，到处是美英帝国主义的哔叽、咔叽、化装用品、高级卷烟，还有美帝国主义的所谓剩余物资，如军呢大衣、丝光咔叽、乳粉、口香糖和马刀之类，和解放前半殖民地的上海洋场很相像。
    随着人民解放军的胜利进军，帝国主义在这儿的统治被推翻了。但是也和全国其他城市一样，虚假的购买力在解放以后货币初稳定时消失了。藏族工商业者积存的商品，特别是帝国主义的高级消费品，无法推销出去，资金不能周转，商业陷于停顿。人民政府看到这种情形，就积极想办法收购这些滞销商品，使藏族人民资金得以周转；加强土产贩运，促进汉藏物资交流。这些措施，更使藏族人民体会到人民政府对自己的好处，因而对人民的祖国日益热爱起来。
    “以茶治边”的反动政策结束了，帝国主义的反动统治也快要完全结束了。在去年先解放了的西康省藏族地区，已经成立了藏族人民自己的自治政府。藏族同胞在历史上第一次站起来做了自己的主人，在伟大的中华人民共和国大家庭里得到了主人翁的幸福和快乐。再没有什么人敢来欺骗、剥削、压迫他们了。他们的土产有了销路，有了合理的价格，同时有了便宜的茶叶，也可以自己栽种茶叶了。所以他们深深地感激毛主席，感激共产党，歌唱毛主席，歌唱共产党。现在藏族人民逢人便说：“毛主席是活菩萨。”“毛主席是藏族人民的救星。”很多善良的藏族宗教信徒在为毛主席念长生经！
