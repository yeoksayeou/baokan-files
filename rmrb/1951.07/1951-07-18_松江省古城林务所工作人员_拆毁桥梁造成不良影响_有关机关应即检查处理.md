　　Staff of Gucheng Forestry Station in Songjiang Province
    Demolish Bridges, Causing Negative Impact
    Relevant Authorities Should Immediately Investigate and Handle
Comrade Editor:
    The Gucheng Forestry Sub-bureau of Linkou County, Songjiang Province, has successively transferred to other forest farms due to the exhaustion of timber in the area. In order to handle the aftermath, the sub-bureau was reorganized into a forestry station. Comrade Shi, the head of the station, began demolishing the forest railway and important bridges, about 50 kilometers long, from Gucheng District to Jiantang District within Linkou County this February, following orders from the General Bureau. From the beginning to early June, nearly two months were spent, completing the demolition of 15 kilometers of railway and three bridges. Near the Dabandao Administrative Village, the masses requested that the bridge not be demolished for the convenience of production. However, the forestry station paid no attention, and after demolishing the bridge, they exchanged the wood for white flour in the village to eat. The masses reflected, saying, "Has the Forestry Bureau forgotten that we provided labor to help you build the railway in 1947? Now you are destroying it like this!"
    In the past, the Gucheng forest railway played a certain role in the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, communications, and gatherings in our county. Now, due to national needs, it can be dismantled. However, regarding the demolition of bridges, the masses have expressed their opinions: bridges should not be demolished, and state timber should not be stolen and sold in exchange for flour to eat. The county's leading organs also believe that this should not be done. Because the amount of bridge timber is actually not large, and at the same time, this timber has been used for a long time, even if it is dismantled, it cannot be reused, which does not greatly benefit the Forestry Bureau, but instead brings difficulties to the masses and affects transportation. The county's leading organs sent people to the forestry station to negotiate, and they admitted that they were acting on the orders of Xu Chang, the Director of the Mudanjiang Forest Industry Administration, and could not but demolish it.
    We believe that some cadres in the Forestry Bureau seriously lack a mass perspective in the demolition of bridges, and have created a very bad political influence among the masses. The leading cadres of the Mudanjiang Forest Industry Administration also disregard the correct suggestions of the local government. Our county government contacted the bureau with an official letter and sent the head of the transportation section to negotiate. Shi, the head of the Gucheng Forestry Station, also conveyed the suggestions of our county government to Director Xu, but none of this had any effect. At the same time, near the Sanhetun lumberyard, six hundred plum trees planted by the women of the entire village last year were all trampled and destroyed by the bureau's personnel.
    I believe that such serious behavior that disregards the interests of the people should be criticized and appropriately punished.

### 松江省古城林务所工作人员  拆毁桥梁造成不良影响  有关机关应即检查处理

　　松江省古城林务所工作人员
    拆毁桥梁造成不良影响
    有关机关应即检查处理编辑同志：
    松江省林口县古城林务分局，由于该地木材伐尽，已先后转移其他林场。为了处理善后，该分局又缩小组织为林务所。该所所长史同志，曾于今年二月奉总局命令，开始拆毁林口县境由古城区至建堂区约五十公里之森林铁道及重要大桥，从开始至六月上旬，已近两月，共拆完铁道十五公里，桥三座。靠近大盘道行政村之桥梁，群众为了便利生产，曾要求不要拆毁。但林务所毫未介意，而且把桥梁拆掉后，以木材去村中换了白面吃。群众反映说：“林务局忘掉一九四七年我们出民工帮你们修铁道啦？现在这样破坏！”
    过去古城森林铁道曾在我县在城乡物资交流和通讯、集会上起了一定作用。现在由于国家需要，是可以拆的。但关于拆毁桥梁一事，群众曾提出意见：不应拆毁桥梁，更不应盗卖国家木材换面吃掉。县的领导机关也认为不应如此。因为桥梁木材实际不多，同时，此项木材已利用了很长时间，即拆毁亦不能再用，对林务局无大的补益，反而给群众带来困难，影响交通。我县领导机关曾派人前去林务所交涉，他们承认是受牡丹江森林工业管理局长徐昌同志的命令，不能不拆。
    我们认为林务局的某些干部在拆毁桥梁这一件事情上，是严重缺乏群众观点的，并已在群众中造成很不好的政治影响。牡丹江森林工业管理局领导干部，对当地政府正确的建议，也置之不理。我县政府曾用公函与该局联系，并派交通科长前去交涉，古城林务所史所长也曾转达我县县政府的建议给徐局长，都没有生效。同时，在三合屯木场附近，去年全村妇女栽植的六百棵李树，也全被该局人员践踏毁掉。
    如此严重地不顾人民利益的行为我认为应当受到批评和适当处分。
