The Main Experiences of Li Shunda's Leadership of the Mutual Aid Team

Li Shunda's mutual aid team has been further consolidated in the patriotic production increase campaign, and its work has also made significant progress. The spring plowing and sowing of the team's eighty-five mu of autumn fields was completed thirty days earlier than in previous years. All autumn fields have now been hoed once, completing the work five days ahead of the original plan. The team has also made significant improvements in agricultural techniques. This year, the team has improved the soil on another fifteen mu of land, and half of the autumn fields have used single-blade plows and improved weeding hoes, increasing plowing and hoeing efficiency by 30% and plowing depth by 75%. This year, all the team's autumn fields have implemented crop rotation and seed disinfection.

In the past six months, Li Shunda's mutual aid team has also gradually established a regular system of political and cultural learning. The whole team reads the newspaper collectively every five days and studies culture regularly. In addition to the teacher, they have also widely launched a movement of mutual teaching and learning among team members. The whole team and each household have annual and seasonal patriotic production increase plans, as well as short-term (five to ten days) plans and seasonal evaluations and summaries. Problems that occur within the team can be resolved democratically at the mutual aid team meeting, and all team members are united very well.

Li Shunda has summarized his main experiences in leading the mutual aid team:

First, conduct frequent patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea during the spring plowing to raise the political consciousness and production enthusiasm of all team members. During the tense spring plowing, the whole team used the time during lunch breaks and evenings to collectively read the newspaper, listen to lectures by civilian school teachers, and organize discussions and chats. This not only raised the political consciousness of general team members, but also transformed some backward-thinking team members. For example, team members Lu Heshan and his son Lu Xinhu were not enthusiastic about participating in the mutual aid team because they did not lack labor and animal power, and they were also not enthusiastic about the movement to resist America and aid Korea. During the rectification of the mutual aid team this spring, everyone criticized them for "not having the spirit of competition" and "not being like liberated households." Some team members suggested expelling them, but Lu Heshan was unwilling to leave the team. Li Shunda persuaded everyone to keep them in the team to strengthen education. After continuous political education and everyone's help, Lu Heshan and his son finally changed, reviewed their backward thinking, and actively participated in various activities.

Second, the production of Li Shunda's mutual aid team has achieved unified planning and arrangement, and the rational use of labor and animal power. Last year, the team's production activities were not arranged well enough. At the beginning of this year's spring plowing, although the whole team and each household had production plans, the production efficiency was not high because the production activities were not arranged in a unified manner. After they challenged the national mutual aid teams, Li Shunda led the mutual aid team to hold two special meetings to carefully study how to arrange production activities in a unified manner. After this work was improved, the production efficiency was significantly improved. For example, before the unified arrangement of soil improvement, the whole team only completed four and a half mu of land in fifteen days. After strict arrangement, it completed eight and a half mu in the same time, and the speed was nearly doubled. For example, when plowing with a five-inch walking plow, the method of plowing with a native plow was adopted at the beginning, and whoever's land was plowed by whoever's family. Only two mu of land were plowed every day. Later, Li Shunda and Li Caifu were specifically responsible for using the new plow to plow the land in sequence, piece by piece. Under the same animal power conditions, three mu of land were plowed every day, and the plowing was flat and deep. The whole team's manure delivery was also greatly improved due to unified planning, giving full play to the power of people and animals. The whole team's 11,000 dan of manure was delivered in only fifteen days, which was not only ten days faster than last year, but also 3,000 dan more manure was delivered.

Third, frequently carry out inspection and evaluation activities within the mutual aid team, promptly solve the production difficulties within the team, and encourage the production enthusiasm of all team members. For example, when Li Shunda inspected the fertilization problem of the mutual aid team, he found that team member Han Xuelan only fertilized 70 dan per mu due to the lack of animal power, which was 50 dan less than the team's plan. Li Shunda immediately allocated the sheep flock to tread the enclosure for Han Xuelan for ten days, which solved Han Xuelan's fertilizer difficulties and ensured that each household in the whole team reached the original planned fertilization amount. Small inspections every five days and large inspections every ten days have become the system of Li Shunda's mutual aid team.

Finally, Li Shunda often pays attention to the internal unity of the mutual aid team. At every mutual aid team meeting, each team member conducts criticism and self-criticism, and the differences of opinion among team members can be resolved in a timely manner, which is of great benefit to the consolidation of the mutual aid team.

### 李顺达领导互助组的主要经验

　　李顺达领导互助组的主要经验
    李顺达互助组在爱国丰产竞赛运动中进一步得到巩固，工作也有显著进步。该组八十五亩秋田的春耕播种工作，比往年缩短三十天完成。全部秋田现已普遍锄过一遍，比原计划提前五天完成。该组在农作技术方面也有很大改进，全组今年又有十五亩土地改良了土壤，半数的秋田使用了单把犁和改良耘锄，耕锄效率提高了百分之三十，耕的深度提高百分之七十五。今年该组所有秋田都实行了调茬换种和进行了种籽的杀菌消毒。
    半年来，李顺达互助组并逐步建立了正规的政治学习和文化学习制度。全组每五天集体读报一次，经常学习文化。除教员外，他们又广泛开展了组员之间的互教互学运动。全组和各户除有全年和季节性的爱国丰产计划外，并有短期（五天至十天）的计划和季节性的评比总结。组内发生的问题，能及时在互助组会议上民主解决，全组组员团结得很好。
    李顺达总结出了他领导互助组的主要经验：
    首先，在春耕中经常进行抗美援朝爱国主义教育，提高全组组员的政治觉悟和生产热情。全组在紧张的春耕中，每天利用晌午歇晌的时候和晚间，集体读报，听民校教员讲课，组织讨论漫谈，这样，不但使一般组员提高了政治觉悟，连一些思想落后的组员亦有了转变。如组员路河山和他的儿子路新虎因不缺乏劳畜力，对参加互助组不积极，对抗美援朝运动也不热心。今春整顿互助组时，大家批评他们“没有竞赛劲头”，“不像个翻身户”，有些组员提议把他们开除出去，但路河山又不愿意出组；李顺达就说服大家把他们留在组内加强教育。经过不断的政治教育和大家的帮助，路河山父子俩终于有了转变，检讨了自己的落后思想，积极参加了各种活动。
    其次，李顺达互助组的生产已做到统一计划和统一安排，合理地使用劳畜力。去年全组生产活动安排的不够好，今年春耕开始时，虽然全组和每户都有生产计划，但由于生产活动未统一安排，生产效率也不高。他们在向全国互助组提出挑战后，李顺达就领导互助组专门开了两次会，仔细研究了如何统一安排生产活动，这一工作改善后，生产效率就显著提高。如改良土壤，未统一安排前，全组十五天只完成了四亩五分地，严密安排后，同一时间内就完成了八亩五分，速度加快近一倍。又如用五寸步犁耕地，开始时采用土犁耕地方法，谁家的地就由谁家的人掌犁，每天只耕地二亩，以后由李顺达、李财福专门负责使用新犁耕地，一块一块顺序耕，在同一畜力条件下每天耕地三亩，犁得又平又深。全组送粪也由于统一作了计划，发挥了人、畜力量，效率大大提高。全组一万一千担粪，只用十五天工夫就送完了，这不但较去年快了十天，还多送了三千担粪。
    再次，在互助组内经常开展检查评比运动，及时解决了组内的生产困难，鼓舞了全组组员的生产热情。如李顺达在检查互助组的施肥问题时，发现组员韩雪兰因没有畜力，每亩上粪七十担，离小组计划还差五十担；李顺达就立即调拨羊群，给韩雪兰踩圈十天，解决了韩雪兰的肥料困难，保证了全组每户达到原计划的施肥量。五天一小检查，十天一大检查，已成为李顺达互助组的制度。
    最后，李顺达经常注意互助组内部的团结问题。在每一次互助组会议上，每个组员都进行了批评和自我批评，组员之间的分歧意见都能及时得到解决，这对互助组的巩固有很大好处。
