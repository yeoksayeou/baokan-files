　　Steel Transportation Line
    Tang Hai
    I sat in a captured American-made ten-wheel truck, loaded with all sorts of military supplies. Driving this truck was a young driver, everyone called him "Little Guangdong," only nineteen years old, with short hair and a white scarf cut from a parachute around his neck. In the rumble of the engine, our truck passed through the high mountains of Korea, along wide roads, across the Cheongcheon River, carrying supplies all the way to the front lines.
    The truck sped quickly. The lights from our truck illuminated the busy road at night, with a constant flow of pedestrians and vehicles. Comrade "Little Guangdong" was busy with both hands and feet, his eyes always looking ahead. His only free part, his mouth, was talking, laughing, and singing, making us forget the fatigue of the journey.
    A crisp gunshot rang out from the distance, followed by one shot after another all around. This indicated that enemy planes were approaching overhead. The headlights on our truck immediately went out. The front of us instantly became pitch black. Suddenly, two flares dropped by the enemy appeared in the sky; soon after, we heard bursts of machine gun fire and booming explosions. "Little Guangdong" said, "At least twenty li away." Our truck didn't stop, but continued slowly forward.
    Before long, Comrade "Little Guangdong" braked the truck. After the rumbling engine stopped, we listened as the sound of the enemy planes gradually moved from near to far. Comrade "Little Guangdong" poked his head out and signaled to the vehicles coming from behind, saying, "Lights on, go!" We heard the rumbling of engines again, and the two beams of white light from the truck shone especially bright in the darkness, and the truck ran with particular energy.
    Thousands upon thousands of brave and resourceful Volunteer Army drivers raced on the roads of Korea. "Planes overhead, timed bombs underfoot," in snowy winter nights, on muddy, slippery rainy days, in the pitch black of night, they passed through the fire of artillery, avoided burning gasoline bombs, and drove safely in the face of machine gun fire, flying shrapnel, and flares that turned night into day. Relying on courage and resourcefulness, and a high sense of patriotic responsibility, they delivered the military supplies to the front, ensuring that the soldiers had food and ammunition.
    I often stayed with the driver comrades in places where cars were hidden, in motor vehicle units, and while the cars were speeding. After understanding their work and life, I deeply felt that the deepest and highest respect should be shown to every driver comrade on the Korean battlefield. They often drove all night, their eyes wide open, without resting all night. When they arrived at the campsite, they first had to hide the vehicles well before they could sleep. "Repairing and protecting cars during the day, driving at night." They worked almost day and night, with little rest.
    The American devils were constantly trying to destroy our transportation lines, and they tried all sorts of vicious methods. At one time, they used planes to drop large numbers of special agents. Those damned things hid in the mountains near the highway, waiting for cars to pass by before firing signal flares into the sky. Every night, enemy planes flew back and forth in the sky like large flies, looking for targets everywhere. Sometimes they dropped gasoline bombs to burn the mountains and people, sometimes they dropped a row of flares to illuminate the area brightly, and even dropped pens and watches that were toy bombs in a vile manner. Anyone who touched them would explode. Once, the enemy suddenly claimed to have a "new invention" that could destroy our steel transportation line. It turned out to be scattering four-cornered nails on the road, which could deflate tires when cars drove over them. But such "new inventions" were too ineffective. With the efforts of our air defense sentries and the Korean people, these "new inventions" were swept off the road with a broom.
    The driver comrades defeated all the enemy's vicious tricks with courage and resourcefulness. Shortly after the start of the Fifth Campaign, a long line of vehicles rushed to transport ammunition to the front, and the enemy dropped a large number of timed bombs on the road ahead. A leading driver-captain got out of the car first to check the situation. After checking, he stood next to the timed bomb and calmly waved his hand and shouted, "Comrades, go!" The first car passed, followed by all the vehicles. The captain later told people, "Who knows when the timed bomb will explode? The front is waiting for ammunition, we don't have time to wait slowly, just go!"
    "Just go!" Our driver comrades were so bold and brave. Transportation on the Korean battlefield has never stopped for a single day. Every road is covered with rolling dust every day. Our transportation line has become a steel transportation line that cannot be broken or bombed.
    Stories about the car drivers on the ground "fighting" the enemy pilots in the sky are also often heard at the front. A particularly prominent example is that Comrade Zhao Baoyin, a driver of a certain regiment, shot down an enemy plane with four bullets from an American-made .30 caliber rifle.
    At eight o'clock in the morning on March 21, Comrade Zhao Baoyin's car, after driving all night, was hidden in a village. Two enemy planes strafed and bombed the village, followed by a second batch. Comrade Zhao Baoyin was very anxious, fearing that his car would be hit. He pulled up his assistant, Cao Xingyi, who had just fallen asleep, and said that he had to shoot down the plane. "If you don't shoot it down, it will bomb and strafe. If you shoot it down, it will still bomb and strafe." The two of them picked up their rifles and started firing. Cao Xingyi fired three shots without hitting, and Zhao Baoyin took over and fired four shots, and the enemy plane fled. Half an hour later, a rescue plane came. Zhao Baoyin knew that the enemy plane had been hit by him. He followed up to investigate and found that a fighter plane had indeed been "taken down" by him.
    The heroic deeds of the driver comrades are endless. Drivers Zhang Jingfu and Wang Zhikui of the 5th Platoon, 4th Company of the Qi × Regiment, encountered a gasoline bomb dropped by an enemy plane while driving, and the car and driver's cab caught fire. They first used their quilts and coats to extinguish the fire in the driver's cab, and then used full power, braving the flames and thick smoke on the car, to drive the car to a safe area, at which point they began to extinguish the flames on the car. Other driver comrades, when enemy planes strafed overhead, turned the car left and right on the road, suddenly braking and suddenly moving forward, making it impossible for the enemy plane to aim during strafing. This is called "twisting the yangko." One driver comrade once found a few pine branches and a broken wooden board, and he used these to build a cover, deliberately making the enemy plane think that it was a "disguised car." His clever plan succeeded. The enemy plane soon discovered the "target," using rockets to bomb it and machine guns to strafe it back and forth without stopping. Our comrade admired the "firepower" of the American imperialists not far away.
    The working hours are particularly long, driving every night, and fighting enemy planes on the road every night. In the past six months or so, a hero who has driven safely for 17,000 li has emerged in the ranks of car drivers. Those who have driven safely for 10,000 kilometers have been credited with a "special merit." Since the launch of the merit-making campaign, they have put forward the slogans of "five fasts" and "four musts": "Start fast, load fast, unload fast, drive fast, repair fast." "Must always check and maintain vehicles, must concentrate on overcoming fatigue, must pay attention to air defense camouflage, must cherish public property and prevent damage." They live with their cars day and night, sitting in the driver's cab to drive, and lying under the car to repair it. Because "the car came from the motherland" and "the supplies came from the motherland," they have a deep affection for the cars and supplies. They load more, drive faster, drive safely and shorten driving time. Therefore, not only have they completed the tasks assigned by their superiors, but they have generally exceeded the tasks. Countless driver comrades have made small, big, and special contributions for the people.
    I once talked with "Little Guangdong," the driver, and I said, "Every driver comrade on the Korean battlefield is qualified to wear the merit medal given by the Chinese and Korean people." This nineteen-year-old apprentice from a car repair shop in Guangdong smiled and said, "It's good to wear a medal, of course. One day I will wear a medal. But now we are fighting the enemy, and the important thing is to complete the task every night."
    I remembered a very popular saying among the driver comrades, which was a heroic saying: "Lights on, go!" Under the strafing and bombing of enemy planes, thousands of cars turned on their headlights, taillights, and turned off their lights, and never stopped working, safely delivering military supplies to the front.

　　钢铁运输线
    唐海
    我坐在一辆缴获来的美制十轮大卡车上，车上堆满了各种各样的军用物品。驾驶这辆大卡车的是一位青年司机，大家都叫他“小广东”，年纪才十九岁，短短的头发，颈上围了一条白色的用降落伞剪成的领巾。在隆隆的马达声里，我们的大卡车经过朝鲜的高山，经过宽阔的大道，越过清川江，载运着物资一直奔向前线。
    大卡车开得飞快，从我们车上射出去的灯光，可以看到夜晚忙碌的公路上来往不断的行人和车辆。“小广东”同志两只手两只脚都在忙碌的工作，两只眼睛总是望着前面。唯一有空闲的嘴吧，又说、又笑、又唱歌，使我们坐在他的旁边，忘记了路上的疲劳。
    一声清脆的枪声从远远的地方传过来，接着四周都是一声接一声的枪声。这表示：敌机快到头顶了。我们车上的大灯立即熄灭。眼前顿时成了漆黑一片。突然间，天空中出现敌人投下的两颗照明弹；不久就听到一阵阵机枪扫射和轰轰爆炸声。“小广东”同志说：“至少有二十里。”我们的卡车没有停，依旧慢慢地前进。
    没隔多久，“小广东”同志煞住了车，隆隆的马达声停住以后，我们听着敌机的声音逐渐由近而远了；“小广东”同志伸出头去，向后面到来的车子招呼说：“打大灯，干！”我们耳朵里又是隆隆的马达声，车上射出去的两道白光，在黑暗里显得特别亮，大卡车也跑得特别有劲。
    千千万万英勇机智的志愿军中的司机，奔驰在朝鲜公路上。“头顶飞机，脚踏定时弹”，在风雪交加的冬夜，在泥泞路滑的雨天，在漆黑的晚上，他们穿过排炮的火网，避开火光熊熊的汽油弹，在机枪扫射、弹片四散、照明弹照得像白昼一样的紧急情况下，安全行车。靠勇敢和机智，靠高度的爱国主义的责任感，他们将军需物资送到了前方，保证了战士们有粮食，有弹药。
    我常常在隐蔽汽车的地方，在汽车兵团里，在汽车正在疾驶的时候，和司机同志在一起。当我了解他们的工作和生活以后，我深深感觉：对于朝鲜战场上的每一位司机同志，都要表示最深最高的敬意。他们经常全夜出车，睁大两只眼睛，整夜不休息。到了宿营地，首先要将汽车隐蔽好，然后才能睡觉。“白天修车、护车，夜晚开车。”他们几乎是日日夜夜都在工作着，很少休息。
    美国鬼子无时无刻不在设法要破坏我们运输线，他们想尽了各种各样的恶毒办法。有一个时候曾用飞机投下大批特务，那些该死的东西就躲在公路附近的山头上，等汽车经过的时候，向天空打信号枪。每到晚上，敌机就像大苍蝇一样，在天空上飞来飞去，到处找目标。有时丢下了汽油弹烧山烧人，有时丢下了一排照明弹照得四处通亮，甚至下流地丢下钢笔和手表玩具炸弹，谁去碰它就爆炸。有一次敌人忽然扬言已经有“最新的发明”可以破坏我们的钢铁运输线了，原来是往公路上撒一种四角钉子，汽车驶过可以使车胎泄气。但是这样的“新发明”太没有作用了。经过我们的防空哨和朝鲜人民的努力，一扫帚就将这些“新发明”从公路上扫光了。
    司机同志们以英勇和机智战胜了敌人种种恶毒的诡计。五次战役开始后不久，一长列汽车赶运弹药到前方，敌人在前进路上丢下了大批定时弹。一位带头的司机队长先下车察看情形；察看以后，他就立在定时炸弹的旁边，镇静地挥手喊道：“同志们，干！”第一辆车开过去了，跟着所有车辆都开过去了。那位队长后来对人说：“谁知道定时弹什么时候爆炸？前方等着要弹药，我们那有时间慢慢地等，干了再说！”
    “干了再说！”我们的司机同志就是这样的大胆和勇敢。朝鲜战场上从来没有一天停止过运输，每一条公路上，每天都是滚滚的尘烟，我们的运输线，成为打不烂、炸不坏的钢铁运输线。
    我们地上的汽车驾驶员和天空敌机驾驶员“斗法”的事情在前方也是常常听到的。一个比较突出的例子是某团司机赵宝印同志用美制三零步枪以四发子弹打下一架敌机。
    三月二十一日上午八点钟，赵宝印同志的汽车赶了一夜路程后，隐蔽在一个村庄里，敌机两架向那村庄扫射轰炸，跟着又来了第二批。赵宝印同志很焦急，怕自己的汽车被打着。他拉起了刚睡下的助手曹兴义，说非要打飞机不可。“你不打它，它轰炸扫射，你打了它也不过轰炸扫射。”两个人就这样拿起步枪干起来。曹兴义打了三枪没有中，赵宝印接过来干了四下，敌机就逃走了。过了半小时，来了一架救护机，赵宝印知道那架敌机被他打中了，他跟着去调查，发现果然一架战斗机就这样被他“干”了下来。
    司机同志们的英勇事迹是说不尽的。汽×团四连五班司机张景福和王志奎同志，在行车中碰上了敌机投下的汽油弹，车上和驾驶台都着了火。他们先用被包和大衣扑灭了驾驶台上的火，然后用足马力，冒着车上的烈火和浓烟，将车子开到安全地带，这时候才动手扑灭车上的火焰。另一些司机同志，在敌机临空扫射时，他们将汽车在公路上左转右转，突然刹车，突然前进，使敌机扫射无法瞄准，这叫做“扭秧歌”。有一位司机同志他有一次找到几根松树枝，一块破木板，他就用这些搭盖起来，故意让敌机以为这是一辆“伪装的汽车”。他的妙计成功了。敌机不久便发现了“目标”，用火箭炮轰，用机枪来回不停扫射。我们那位同志就在不远的地方欣赏美帝国主义者的“火力”。
    工作时间特别长，夜夜出车，夜夜都在公路上和敌机战斗，半年多来在汽车司机的队伍里，已经出现了安全行车一万七千里的英雄。人车平安行驶一万公里的都被记上了一个“特功”。自从展开立功运动后，他们提出了“五快”、“四要”的口号：“发动快，装车快，卸车快，行驶快，修理快。”“要随时检查保养车辆，要集中精力克服疲劳，要注意防空伪装工作，要爱护公物不使损伤。”他们白天黑夜都和他们的车子生活在一起，坐在驾驶台开车，躺在车底下修车。由于“车子是祖国来的”，“物资是祖国来的”，他们对于汽车和物资都有了深厚的感情。他们装得多，开得快，安全行车而且缩短了行车时间。因此，不仅完成了上级交下的任务，一般的都超过了任务。数不清楚的司机同志都为了人民立下了小功、大功和特功。
    我曾经和开车的“小广东”同志谈过，我说：“朝鲜战场上每一位司机同志都有资格挂上中朝人民给的立功奖章。”这位十九岁、来自广东一个汽车修理厂的学徒笑着说：“挂奖章当然好，总有一天我要挂上奖章的。但是现在我们正在和敌人作战，要紧的还在夜夜完成任务。”
    我记起了司机同志中一句很流行的话，那是一句富有英雄气概的话：“打大灯，干！”在敌机扫射轰炸下，成千的汽车都在打起大灯、小灯、熄灭了灯，从来不停止地干，把军用物资安全地送到了前方。
