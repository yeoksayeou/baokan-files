　　Most Locusts in Hebei Eliminated
　  Small Areas Still Being Sprayed and Beaten

Under the leadership and assistance of the Central People's Government and with the concerted efforts of the vast number of cadres and farmers in the province, most of the million mu of locusts in Hebei Province have been eliminated.

Since late May, locusts have been discovered successively in reed marshes, weedy wastelands, and low-lying wetlands along the coast and rivers of 72 counties, including Huanghua, Fengnan, and Xincheng, in Hebei Province, totaling approximately one million mu.

The local people's government immediately organized the people to spray and beat them. Yang Xiandong, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, and Li Shijun, Director of the Plant Protection Department, immediately rushed to Huanghua County, where the locust infestation was severe, to guide the spraying and beating. The Central People's Government successively allocated 250,000 jin of insecticide powder and more than 1,000 sprayers to Huanghua County, and on June 13, dispatched four airplanes to the county to assist in the control. The Hebei Provincial People's Government also issued an emergency directive, calling on all localities to vigorously mobilize farmers to inspect and eliminate locusts on the spot in a timely manner. At the same time, the Provincial People's Government also transferred more than 200 cadres, experts, and students from government offices to form an insecticide work team, led by Zhang Jiguang, Director of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, and Zhang Kerang, Deputy Director, to go to the countryside separately to assist the prefectural and county people's governments where locusts occurred in organizing the masses to carry out spraying and beating. Each prefecture and county established a locust control headquarters to be responsible for unified leadership and command. Commissioners, county heads, and county and district cadres went deep into the countryside to help local farmers devise various methods of spraying and beating, ensuring that every village had leaders and every place had people responsible, mobilizing nearly one million farmers in locust-infested areas to form a large locust control force, camping out in the fields and eating in the open, and working day and night in a concentrated and arduous effort for more than 40 days. As of early July, more than 750,000 mu of the million mu of locusts in the province had been eliminated, and the remaining 200,000 mu are still being sprayed and beaten.
