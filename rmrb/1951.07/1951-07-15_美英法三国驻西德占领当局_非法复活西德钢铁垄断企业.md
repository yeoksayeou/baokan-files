Xinhua News Agency, July 13th: Frankfurt News: The U.S., British, and French occupation authorities in Germany illegally and arbitrarily approved the official revival of twenty-eight steel companies formerly owned by German steel monopoly capitalists on June 28th. The first five of these companies were officially declared established on July 10th. The predecessors of these twenty-eight steel companies were the pre-war six major steel cartels and several smaller steel companies that possessed 85 to 90 percent of West Germany's steel production capacity. According to the Potsdam Agreement, these monopoly enterprises should have been completely dissolved, but for six years after the war, the American occupiers have kept them under their so-called trust companies and continued to operate them. Now, in order to expand its large-scale production more effectively for its war preparations, the United States nominally splits them into twenty-eight new companies and returns them to their original owners. On the one hand, it uses this to disguise the so-called "de-cartelization" as having been completed, so that they can obtain public and legal status and fully restore steel production. On the other hand, it also attempts to use this to appease the Western European people who firmly oppose the revival of German monopoly capital, and prepare the foundation for implementing the Schuman Plan for joint Western European coal and steel industries.
    U.S. imperialism is exercising strict control over these companies. The Associated Press has revealed: In the restoration of West German steel companies, "the next major issue to be decided is the final distribution of the new company's stock and the satisfaction of the old company's creditors (including 'many' American interests)." This fully shows that the United States will actually use its position as a creditor to West German capitalists to direct the West German steel industry to serve its war policy to the end.

　　美英法三国驻西德占领当局
    非法复活西德钢铁垄断企业
    【新华社十三日讯】法兰克福消息：美、英、法三国驻德占领当局已于六月二十八日非法擅自批准为前德国钢铁垄断资本家所有的二十八家钢铁公司正式复活，其第一批五个公司已于七月十日正式宣告成立。这二十八个钢铁公司的前身乃是拥有西德产钢能力百分之八十五至九十的战前六大钢铁卡特尔及几个较小的钢铁公司。根据波茨坦协定，这些垄断企业本来应该予以彻底解散，但是，战争结束后六年以来，美国占领者却一直把它置于自己的所谓信托公司之下，继续经营。到现在，美国为了要放手扩大其大生产，使之更有效地为自己的备战计划工作，就把它们在名义上分散为二十八家新公司，发回原主，一方面以此伪装所谓“非卡特尔化”已经完成，使之取得公开合法的地位，来全力恢复钢铁生产；一方面也企图以此来搪塞坚决反对德国垄断资本复活的西欧人民，而为实行联营西欧煤钢工业的舒曼计划准备基础。
    美帝国主义对这些公司正实行严格的控制。合众社业已透露：在恢复西德各钢铁公司方面，“下一个尚待决定的主要问题：是新公司股票的最后分配及满足旧公司的债权人（其中包括‘很多’美国利益）。”这就充分表示了美国实际上将以对西德资本家的债主地位，而指挥西德钢铁工业为其战争政策服务到底。
