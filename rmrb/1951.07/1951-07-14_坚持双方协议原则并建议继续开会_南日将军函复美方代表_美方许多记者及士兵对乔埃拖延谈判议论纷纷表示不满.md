Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 13th: This reporter has learned from the headquarters on the Korean front that General Joy, the chief representative of the United Nations Command delegation, sent a letter yesterday to General Nam Il, the chief representative of our delegation. This morning, General Nam Il replied as follows:

General Joy:

I have received your letter. My reply is as follows:

(1) We did not obstruct your delegation from coming to the meeting at 7:45 a.m. on the 12th. As for the journalists who came with the cars, they were naturally not allowed to enter the negotiation area because no agreement had been reached between the two sides. Therefore, it is unreasonable for your delegation to refuse to attend the meeting.

(2) Regarding the issue of press reporters and news representatives' coverage, our opinion is: without mutual agreement, press reporters and news representatives from either side shall not enter the negotiation area.

(3) We suggest continuing the meeting at 9:00 a.m. (Pyongyang time) today.

	General Nam Il, Chief Representative of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers Delegation

Joy's letter yesterday was as follows:

General Nam Il:

(1) At 9:30 a.m. on July 12, 1951, my motorcade carrying the personnel I needed at the meeting location, traveling along the Munsan-Kaesong road, was refused passage through your sentry post by your armed guards.

(2) I have ordered this motorcade to return to the United Nations front.

(3) Upon receiving notification from you that the personnel I have selected, including the news representatives I deem necessary, will not be hindered from reaching the meeting location, I am prepared to come again with my delegation and continue the discussions that were adjourned yesterday.

	Vice Admiral Joy, Chief Representative of the United Nations Command

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 13th: Many reporters concentrated at the United Nations Command delegation's station are discussing the temporary interruption of the Korean armistice negotiations. According to a United Press reporter, Becker, in a telegram on the 12th: "The press corps sitting on the peace train here is troubled; they hope that the negotiations will not be terminated because of the request to allow them to enter Kaesong during the negotiations." "The strong tone of Joy's reply has caused criticism from many here. The wording of the previous notification from the Communists (referring to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers delegation) was quite tactful. Many people believe that Joy's attitude in his reply seems too rash." "An experienced Korean war correspondent summarized the attitude of most people as follows: 'They don't want to play by our rules, so we picked up our stones (a type of stone used in children's games) and went home.' This argument is terribly trivial." A United Press reporter cabled again on the 13th: "We cannot believe that we are the cause of the interruption of negotiations on such a decisive matter (referring to the armistice negotiations). We don't know what kind of trickery is going on in the secret rooms of Tokyo and Washington. We certainly don't believe that Joy announced the suspension of peace negotiations because he was angered by the Communist's attitude towards journalists. We don't know what Washington (or Tokyo) told him before he issued his decisive and historic note." The reporter also said: "Joy's notification sounds as if our side wants to suspend negotiations. People certainly cannot allow such a small matter as whether to allow twenty reporters to enter Kaesong to hinder the effort to end the war. This war, which has lasted for a year, has sacrificed countless millions of people. Why doesn't Vice Admiral Joy send a representative to Kaesong to negotiate with the Communists on the issue of allowing reporters into the city? Why doesn't he ask the Communists on what grounds they won't let our people enter Kaesong? Why doesn't he leave room for negotiation? In other words, why is he using such a trivial and less important matter to hinder the resolution of a major war?"

Soldiers on the front lines of the United Nations Command are also dissatisfied that the United Nations Command delegation did not go to Kaesong to continue the armistice negotiations. According to a Reuters reporter in a telegram on the 12th: "Most soldiers on the front line say: Let us first make the ceasefire a reality, and then argue. Tanker Staff Sergeant Arlin said: 'Let's continue negotiations while there is still a chance. Indeed, our right to send reporters to interview is only a secondary consideration. If we are sincere, we should stop the war, start saving lives, and then argue about some minor details.' Private Cain said he believes the primary responsibility of the United Nations negotiators is to resolve the ceasefire issue. He said: 'Let us first make the ceasefire a reality, and then argue. We have already wasted a day, which makes me restless. Because people are dying every day we argue. For God's sake, let's end the war first and then argue about things that seem irrelevant to the fate of the combat soldiers!'"

　　坚持双方协议原则并建议继续开会
    南日将军函复美方代表
    美方许多记者及士兵对乔埃拖延谈判议论纷纷表示不满
    【新华社平壤十三日电】本社记者从朝鲜前线总部获悉，联合国军代表团首席代表乔埃昨日有函给我方代表团首席代表南日将军。今晨，南日将军复函如下：乔埃将军：你的来函收到了。兹答复于下：
    （一）我们十二日上午七时四十五分并未阻难你的代表团前来开会。至于随车同来的新闻记者，因为双方并未达成协议，自然不能允许他们来谈判地区。你们的代表团因而拒绝到会，是没有道理的。
    （二）对于新闻记者及新闻代表人员采访问题，我们的意见是：未得双方协议，任何一方的新闻记者与新闻代表人员，均不得进入谈判地区。
    （三）我们建议：今天上午九时（平壤时间）继续开会。
          朝鲜人民军、中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表南日将军
    乔埃昨日来函如下：南日将军：
    （一）一九五一年七月十二日九时三十分，载有我在会议地点所需要的人员的沿汶山、开城路上行驶的我方汽车队，被贵方的武装卫兵拒绝通过贵方的哨岗。
    （二）我已命令这个车队驶回联合国前线。
    （三）在接获贵方通知，携带我所遴选的人员，其中包含我认为必须的新闻代表人员，将不受阻难而到达会议地点时，我准备偕同我的代表团重来，并继续昨天休会了的商谈。
       海军中将、联合国军首席代表乔埃
    【新华社平壤十三日电】许多集中在联合国军代表团驻地的记者，对于朝鲜停战谈判的暂时中断议论纷纷。据美联社记者贝克尔十二日电称：“坐在此地和平列车上的记者团是烦恼的，他们希望不致因允许他们在谈判期间进入开城的要求而使谈判终止。”“乔埃的复文强硬的语调引起此地许多人的批评，共产党（按指朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军代表团）先前发来的通知的措词倒是相当委婉的。许多人认为乔埃复文的态度似乎太莽撞。”“阅历丰富的朝鲜战地记者综结大多数人的态度如下：‘他们不愿照我们的规则玩，所以我们拿起我们的石弹子（一种儿童游戏所用的石子）就回家了。’这个争论琐细得要命。”美联社记者十三日电又称：“我们不能相信在这样一件具有决定意义的事情上（指停战谈判），我们是谈判中断的原因。我们不知道东京和华盛顿的秘室内在搞什么鬼。我们当然不相信乔埃宣告中止举行和平谈判是因为共产党对待新闻记者的态度使他动了火。我们不知道华盛顿（或东京）在他发出他的干脆和具有历史意义的照会之前跟他说过什么话。”该记者又说：“乔埃的通知听起来好像我们这一方面想中止谈判似的。人们无疑地不能让是否准许二十名记者进入开城这样一个小问题阻挠结束战争的努力，这个历时一年的战争已经使数不清的千千万万的人牺牲了生命。为什么乔埃中将不派一个代表到开城去和共产党谈判准许记者入城的问题呢？他为什么不问共产党他们根据什么理由不让我们的人进入开城呢？他为什么不留一个谈判的余地呢？换句话说他为什么把这样一个琐碎的、比较不重要的问题去阻挠一个大战的解决呢？”
    在前线的联合国军士兵也不满意联合国军代表团没有到开城去继续举行停战谈判。据路透社记者十二日电称：“前线士兵大多数说：让我们首先使停火实现，然后再来争论吧。坦克手阿林上士说：‘让我们在还有可能时，继续谈判吧。的确，我们派记者去采访的权利不过是一个次要的考虑。如果我们是诚恳的话，我们就应使战争停止，开始拯救人命，然后再来争论一些细微末节的事情。’二等兵凯因说，他认为联合国谈判者的首要责任是解决停火问题。他说：‘让我们首先使停火实现，然后再来争论。我们已经浪费了一天，这使我坐立不安。因为我们争论的每一天都有人在死亡。看老天面上，让我们首先使战争结束，然后再来争论那些对作战士兵的命运看来毫不相干的事情吧！’”
