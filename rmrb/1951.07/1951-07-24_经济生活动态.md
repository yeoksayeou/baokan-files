　　Economic Life Trends
  Mobilize More Women to Production Posts
    According to statistics, in seventy cities, counties, and banners in the three provinces of Heilongjiang, Rehe, and Jilin, approximately two million women have participated in agricultural production. In Rehe Province, almost all rural women with labor power have participated in agricultural production this year. They not only perform auxiliary agricultural tasks such as seed selection, trial planting, seed soaking, manure delivery, and chopping straw, but many have also participated in major tasks such as plowing, sowing, and weeding. In Yixian County, a key cotton-growing area in Liaoxi Province, the mobilization of over 18,000 women to participate in drought-resistant cotton planting helped complete the task of planting 230,000 mu of cotton ahead of schedule, and timely cotton field protection and pest control work was carried out. Many places have established childcare organizations during the busy farming season; mutual aid groups have also adopted methods of evaluating work based on labor and equal pay for equal work. Furthermore, the increased political awareness of women through patriotic education has enabled many women to actively participate in agricultural production with determination and possibility. This has enabled many male laborers to go to national defense construction and industrial production posts, and can have greater power to continuously improve agricultural production and sideline production. Encouraging the broad masses of women to participate in production is of great significance.
  "Off-season" Becomes Peak Season
    The economic situation in Luohe City, Henan Province, this year is much more prosperous than in the past. Handicraft workers and businesses engaged in the manufacturing and sale of agricultural tools are particularly prosperous. The total capital of blacksmithing, smelting, ironware, bamboo, and wood industries increased tenfold in May this year compared to May last year, but still cannot meet the needs of farmers. In May, 13,000 bamboo brooms for sweeping wheat fields were sold in seven days, more than the total sales for the entire year last year; the sales of iron-wheeled ox carts and livestock increased fivefold compared to last spring. The state-owned department store sold 120 boxes of matches in two hours on one day at the end of May, more than eight and a half times the total sales for the entire month of May last year. The sales volume of cloth in March, April, and May was two and a half times higher than in the same three months last year, and the quality was also much better than last year. The state-owned department store sold four times more fountain pens this spring than last spring. Many goods are in short supply and often out of stock. The old habit of "living off one's savings during the off-season," which handicraft workers in the city have always had, is gone forever. Why is this? It is because the surrounding twenty-plus counties completed land reform last spring, and the summer and autumn agricultural output increased by one-fifth, increasing farmers' purchasing power. Such a big change in a small city in this year foreshadows the broad prospects of China's industrial production.
  Broad Road for Cultural and Medical Supplies Industry
    Before liberation, there were only 189 cultural and educational instrument factories in Shanghai, with more than 4,100 employees. Now, the number has increased to more than 1,000, with about 15,000 employees. In 1950, the output of stationery and instruments in Shanghai increased fourfold compared to 1949, with an annual turnover of more than 340 billion yuan. Fountain pens made in Shanghai sell as far as the border regions. Among them, gold nib pens are durable and most popular among the People's Liberation Army and general workers, students, and cadres; steel pens are cheap and suitable for the needs of workers and peasants after their emancipation. The monthly output has increased to 3 million pieces. Other duplicating equipment, carbon paper, wax paper, and ink are also in short supply. Many well-known products are already booked several months in advance. Some instrument factories have received orders for half a year later. The universal development of people's cultural and recreational activities has greatly increased the sales of musical instruments. Mass recreational equipment such as ping-pong balls and billiards are also generally in short supply. Due to the government's care and attention to the people's medical and health undertakings, hospitals and clinics have been established in factories, mines, and rural areas, and the medical device industry is developing rapidly. The number of factories manufacturing medical devices in Shanghai has increased from twenty or thirty before liberation to 311, with a total monthly product value of 14 billion yuan.
    This reflects the improvement of people's cultural life after the liberation of the Chinese people and after the land reform in the countryside. This is also one of the results of the Chinese people taking control of their customs autonomy and ending the dumping of foreign goods. The situation of American Parker pens, ballpoint pens, as well as American ink, American paper, and American stationery flooding the Chinese market will never happen again; the days of sluggish business for the cultural and educational supplies manufacturing industry in various parts of our country will never come again.

　　经济生活动态
  把更多妇女动员到生产岗位上去
    据统计，黑龙江、热河、吉林三省七十个市、县、旗，已有两百万左右妇女参加了农业生产。其中热河省有劳动力的农村妇女，今年几乎全部都参加了农业生产。她们不仅做选种、试种、浸种、送粪、铡草等农业辅助劳动，而且有很多人已参加了犁地、播种、锄地等主要劳动。辽西省重点植棉区义县，在抗旱植棉中，由于动员了一万八千多名妇女参加，提前完成了植棉二十三万亩的任务，并及时地进行了棉田保苗、防虫等工作。许多地方都在农忙时成立托儿组织；各互助组也采取了按劳评工、同工同酬的办法；加以妇女在爱国主义教育中政治觉悟提高，就使许多妇女有了决心并有了可能积极参加农业生产。这就使很多男劳动力能够走到国防建设与工业生产的岗位上去，并能有更大力量使农业生产、副业生产不断提高。鼓励广大妇女参加生产，是有重大意义的。
  “淡季”变成了旺季
    河南漯河市今年经济情况比过去那一年都繁荣得多。制造和贩卖农具的手工业者和商号生意特别兴隆，打铁、冶炼、铁货、竹行、木行各业资金总数今年五月比去年五月增加了十倍，但仍不能满足农民的需要。五月份有七天中销了一万三千把打扫麦场的竹扫帚，比去年全年的销量还多；铁轮牛车和牲口比去年春天多销了五倍。国营百货公司在五月底有一天两小时内卖了一百二十箱火柴，比去年五月份全月销量多了八倍半。布匹在三、四、五三个月中销售量比去年这三个月多两倍半，而且质量也比去年好得多。国营百货公司卖出的自来水钢笔，今年春天比去年春天多卖了四倍。许多货品供不应求，经常缺货。该市手工业者历来“淡月啃老本”的老例已经一去不复返了。这是因为什么呢？就因为该市周围二十多县在去春完成了土地改革，夏、秋农产量提高了五分之一，农民购买力提高了。这样一个小城市在这一年中的大变化，预示着中国工业生产的广阔前途。
  文化医疗用品工业的广阔道路
    上海市文教仪器工厂，在解放前只有一百八十九家，职工四千一百余人，现在已增加到一千余家，职工人数达到一万五千人左右。一九五○年上海文具仪器的产量比一九四九年增加了四倍，全年营业额达三千四百余亿元。上海制造的自来水笔销路远达边疆。其中金笔坚固耐用，最受解放军及一般工人、学生、干部的欢迎；钢笔因价格低廉，适合翻身后工人农民的需要，月产量已增至三百万枝。其他腾印用具、复写纸、腊纸、油墨等也供不应求，许多名牌产品，几个月以后的货都被订下了。有些仪器厂已接到半年以后的订货。人民文化娱乐活动的普遍发展，使乐器的销路大增。乒乓球、康乐球等大众化的娱乐器具，也普遍供不应求。由于政府对人民医药卫生事业的关怀重视，工厂、矿山、农村中纷纷设立医院、诊疗所，医疗器械工业迅速发展。上海制造医疗器械的工厂已从解放前的二、三十家增加到的三百十一家，每月产品总值达一百四十亿元。
    这反映了中国人民解放后、农村土地改革后人民文化生活的提高。这也是中国人民自己掌握了海关自主权，终止了外货倾销的结果之一。美国派克笔、原子笔以至美国墨水、美国纸张、美国信笺泛滥于中国市场的情况是永远不会再来了；我国各地文教用品制造业生意萧条的日子永远不会再来了。
