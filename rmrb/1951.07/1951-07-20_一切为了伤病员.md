Korean Correspondence

　　Everything for the Wounded and Sick
　　Xie Ning
　　On the Korean front, the Chinese People's Volunteers stretcher team, with their great spirit of loving the motherland and loving the wounded and sick, used their blood and sweat to write glorious and immortal heroic deeds.
　　During the battle on the south bank of the Han River, a company of the Shuangcheng stretcher team, which had rushed from the Yalu River to a certain place south of the 38th parallel, accepted the urgent task of carrying the wounded. Every night, they had to wade several times and climb nearly a hundred miles of mountain roads to transport the lightly and severely wounded down. Moreover, sometimes the roads, and even remote paths, were harassed by enemy artillery fire and aircraft, and sometimes they had to cross high mountains and ridges, climbing up and down in uninhabited places, and opening up new roads in the wilderness. They persisted in this area for more than ten days and nights—climbing more than a thousand miles of mountain roads and crossing countless rivers, so that the wounded from the Battle of Qixingli could be quickly and safely transferred down and receive timely treatment.
　　One rainy night, Han Decai, the leader of the fifth group of the first company of the stretcher team, and two team members carried a wounded soldier down from the front line. They had just waded across a small river and were not far up the ridge when they encountered a steep slope of sixty or seventy feet high, with only a narrow path to climb. Two of them carried, and one helped, but they couldn't get up; one carried on their back, and two helped, but they still couldn't get up. Other places were even steeper and more dangerous, almost like cliffs. Han Decai was a strong and sturdy young man of twenty-seven or eight years old, but now there were cliffs and precipices in front of him, and enemy planes were buzzing overhead, and flares were constantly flashing overhead; enemy artillery fire was constantly bombarding the flanks of the road and mountain path, and the sparks could be seen clearly. Han Decai was sweating profusely, but still couldn't get up. Finally, they came up with a solution: dismantle the ropes on the stretcher, and then tie all the ropes and belts around everyone's waist together. One person climbed up first, hung the rope on the big rock above, and then spread cotton-padded clothes on the icy and slippery slope. Then, another person put the wounded soldier on their back, pulled the rope, stepped on the cotton-padded clothes and climbed up. The two people helped and pushed from the side. Finally, with the greatest perseverance, they overcame all difficulties and climbed the steep slope before dawn.
　　The stretcher bearers don't know how many times they have encountered such difficulties, and they don't know how many times they have overcome them. This can be imagined from a "clapper talk" popular in their team:
　　“Climbing one ridge after another, ridges connecting ridges,
　　Desolate mountain trails, cliffs are steep,
　　Every step forward is full of sweat!
　　The left hand clings to a small branch,
　　The right hand pulls on a large rock,
　　Climbing up the mountainside and looking down,
　　The ravine is deep and the cliff is steep, making the eyes dizzy!
　　All hardships can be endured,
　　All for the sake of the wounded and sick."
　　They take meticulous care of the wounded. When it's cold, they would rather freeze themselves and take off their cotton clothes to spread on and cover the wounded. Experienced migrant workers who had worked as stretcher bearers during the domestic Liberation War, each carried two iron bowls or an extra gourd ladle when they went abroad this time—to be used as urinals for the wounded; those who didn't have them used their own rice bowls to collect the wounded's feces and urine. In the early days of their going abroad, many people accidentally fell into mountain gullies at night, but they never dropped a wounded soldier once. No matter how low the planes flew, how bright the flares shone, or how fierce the artillery fire was, they always lifted them gently and slowly, and quickly and safely transferred the wounded.
　　One morning, a squad was carrying several wounded soldiers, preparing to rest. Before dawn, two American fighter planes came and blindly strafed a small village at the foot of the mountain. A small house caught fire, and four seriously wounded soldiers had not yet been carried out. Team members Gao Changqing, Zhang Anxi, Kou Defeng, etc., immediately rushed to the rescue, regardless of everything. They carried out three the first time. Kou Defeng and Zhang Anxi placed two wounded soldiers under the bridge hole and asked Gao Changqing to take care of them, and said to the wounded: "Comrades, take shelter here first, we will be back soon, there are still comrades in the house who have not been carried out!" After saying that, they rushed to the house where the fire was getting bigger and bigger. It was during this run, under the strafing of enemy planes, that Comrade Kou Defeng, an excellent Communist Party member, sacrificed his life to rescue his wounded brothers. Kou Defeng's sacrifice aroused Zhang Anxi's hatred for the American robbers even more. He immediately plunged into the thick smoke and raging fire and carried out the last wounded soldier whose clothes were already burning. When they sent the wounded soldiers to the designated location, one of the wounded Volunteer Army platoon leaders asked them to leave their names. The platoon leader said with emotion: "I will definitely report your heroic deeds to the higher authorities. You are more like brothers to us than our own brothers..."
　　The heroic actions of the Volunteers on the battlefield educated every stretcher bearer and inspired the fighting enthusiasm and confidence in victory of every stretcher bearer. And the model deeds of the volunteer stretcher bearers who came from afar from the motherland, cherishing the wounded, overcoming difficulties, and working hard, also inspired the determination and courage of the Volunteer Army soldiers to kill the enemy. The hard work of the heroic stretcher bearers ensured that the wounded Volunteer Army soldiers were transferred down for treatment in time. Therefore, the Volunteer Army leaders and soldiers cared about their work and life like brothers. The soldiers would rather go barefoot and give their shoes to the stretcher bearers whose shoes were worn out; they would rather eat less and share their food with them. What the stretcher bearers felt most happy about and were most proud of was the care and rewards given to them by the Volunteer Army commanders, fighters, and leading organs. On the entrance of the air-raid shelter where this company of the Shuangcheng stretcher team lived, the red flag of "Rescuing heroes, supreme glory" made them feel infinite glory and also gave them the greatest encouragement.

### 一切为了伤病员

　　一切为了伤病员
    谢宁
    在朝鲜前线，中国人民抗美援朝志愿担架队以爱祖国、爱伤病员的伟大精神，用自己的血汗写下了光辉不朽的英雄事迹。
    在汉江南岸的战斗中，由鸭绿江边一直赶到三八线以南某地的双城担架队的一个中队，接受了紧急的抬运伤员的任务。他们每一个夜晚都要趟几次水，爬近百里的山路把轻重伤员运下去。而且有时公路、甚至偏僻的小路都有敌人的炮火和飞机骚扰，有时还得横越高山大岭，从没有人迹的地方爬上爬下，在荒山旷野里开辟新的道路。他们仅在这个地区就坚持了十几个昼夜——爬了一千多里的山路，渡过无数的河川，使七星里战斗的伤员迅速安全地转运下来，得到及时地治疗。
    在一个雨后的黑夜里，担架队一中队五组组长韩德才和两个队员从火线上抬下来一个伤员。他们才趟过一条小河向岭上攀登不远，就遇到一个六七丈高的陡坎，只有一条很窄的小路可以爬上去。他们两个抬着，一个人扶着上不去；一个人背着，两个人扶着还是上不去。别的地方更陡更险，简直和绝壁一般。韩德才是个二十七八岁刚强而健壮的小伙子，可是现在前面是悬崖陡壁，而且敌机还在头上嗡嗡乱叫，照明弹也不断地在头上闪亮；敌人的炮火不断地轰击着侧翼的公路和山道，火花都看得清清楚楚的。韩德才急得满身流汗，仍然是上不去。最后，他们想出一个办法：拆掉担架上的绳子，再把每个人腰间所有的绳带结在一起，先由一个人爬上去，把绳子挂在上面的大石头上，又把棉袄铺在冰滑的陡坡上，然后由另一个人把伤员放在背上，曳着绳带踩着棉袄往上爬，两个人在旁边连扶带推，终于以最大的毅力克服了一切困难，在拂晓前攀上了陡壁。
    像这样的困难，担架队员们不知遇到多少次，又不知克服了多少次。从他们队里流行着的一个“快板”便可想见了：
    “爬上一岭又一山，山岭不断岭连山，
    荒山僻道悬崖陡，前进一步满身汗！
    左手攀住小树枝，右手拉住大石岩，
    爬上山腰往下看，涧深崖陡眼发眩！
    千辛万苦都能受，一心为了伤病员。”
    他们爱护伤员是体贴入微的。天冷，他们宁可自己受冻，把棉衣脱下给伤员铺上盖上。曾在国内解放战争做过担架工作的有经验的民工们，这次出国时每人都携带两个铁碗，或另外带一个葫芦瓢——给伤员做大小便器用；没有的人，他们就用自己的饭碗给伤员接屎接尿。他们出国的初期，在夜里走路有不少人不小心摔到山沟里去，但是就没有摔过一次伤员。那怕飞机飞得再低；照明弹照得再亮，炮火打得再厉害，他们都是轻抬慢放，迅速地安全地转运伤员。
    一天早晨，一个小队抬着几名伤员准备休息，天还没亮就来了两架美国战斗机，向着山下的小村庄盲目扫射，一座小房被打起了火，里面有四名重伤员还没有背出来。队员高长清、张安锡、寇德峰等马上就不顾一切奔去抢救。第一次背出了三个，寇德峰和张安锡把两个伤员放在桥洞下叫高长清照护，并且向伤员说：“同志，先在这里避一避，我们马上回来，屋里还有没背出来的同志哩！”说罢又奔向火势越来越大的房屋去，就在这奔跑途中，在敌机的扫射下，优秀的共产党员寇德峰同志为了抢救负伤的兄弟，献出了自己的生命。寇德峰的牺牲，更激起了张安锡对美国强盗的仇恨。他立刻钻进浓烟烈火之中，背出来最后一个衣服已经烧着了的伤员。当他们把伤员送到指定地点的时候，其中一个负伤的志愿军的排长要他们留下名字，这位排长他感动地说：“我一定把你们的英勇事迹，报告上级，你们对我们真是比亲兄弟还亲……”
    志愿军在战场上的英雄行为教育着每个担架队员，鼓舞着每个担架队员的战斗热情和胜利信心。而从祖国远道奔来的志愿担架队员爱护伤员、克服困难艰苦奋斗的模范事迹，也同样鼓舞着志愿军战士们的杀敌决心和勇气。英雄的担架队员的艰苦奋斗，保证了志愿军战士们负伤后及时转下治疗。因而志愿军的首长和战士们都兄弟般地关心他们的工作和生活，战士们宁可自己打赤脚，而把鞋子给鞋穿破了的担架队员；自己少吃点，而把粮食分给他们吃。担架队员们最感到愉快和引为光荣的，是志愿军指战员和领导机关对他们的关怀和奖励。在双城担架队这一个中队住的防空洞口上，那面“抢救英雄，无上光荣”的红旗，使他们感到无限的光荣，同时也给予他们最大的鼓舞。
