　　Annihilation of the U.S. Army 187th Airborne Regiment
    The U.S. 187th Airborne Regiment, numbering approximately three thousand, parachuted into the area around Munsan-ni, north of Seoul, and the nearby areas of Paju-ri, Seonyu-ri, and Bongseo-ri on March 23rd of this year, attempting to encircle Korean People's Army units.

    What particularly aroused the anger of the Korean people was that the army of the Japanese militarists – the age-old enemy of the Korean people – parachuted alongside the American paratroopers to participate in the combat.

    It is said that this group of paratroopers was personally directed in combat by then-Eighth U.S. Army Commander General Ridgway. However, this adventurous operation by the U.S. paratroopers was completely crushed by the heroic and invincible People's Army.

    Before dawn on March 23rd, a unit of the Kim Chang-bong detachment, after a long march, arrived near Munsan-ni north of Seoul and immediately set up positions.

    Dawn broke, and the surrounding morning mist began to dissipate. The quiet sky of the morning was suddenly filled with the sound of enemy aircraft. More than four hundred various fighters and light bombers flew like a flock of crows over the area of Munsan-ri, Paju-ri, Seonyu-ri, and Bongseo-ri where our army units were positioned.

    Enemy aircraft bombed, strafed, and dropped napalm bombs on the highlands, villages, and mountain streams above our positions, while also dropping smoke bombs, enveloping the surrounding area in black smoke. This air raid continued for about thirty minutes.

    The combatants of the Kim Chang-bong detachment had long seen through the fact that the purpose of this enemy air raid was by no means simple.

    "Do not be shaken by any action of the enemy aircraft. Each combatant must not allow the enemy to discover their position and be prepared for battle." The orders from above were transmitted to all units.

    Just then, about one hundred enemy transport planes, under the cover of fighters and bombers, circled two or three times before beginning to drop parachutes.

    About three thousand enemy paratroopers, along with 105mm howitzers, light tanks, jeeps, trucks, ammunition, grain, etc., attached to parachutes of various colors, began to descend over our positions.

    "You've come just in time; we'll wipe you all out today!" The soldiers, looking at the American paratroopers in mid-air, were filled with confidence in victory.

    After a while, the enemy paratroopers approached the ground. The People's Army soldiers, prepared to engage, began to fire on the descending enemy.

    The enemy, expecting to land in an uninhabited area, was thrown into panic and extreme confusion by the unexpected blow. This situation put the enemy in a dilemma: if they stopped the landing, all the soldiers already on the ground would be annihilated. Therefore, in order to reinforce the paratroopers on the ground, the enemy hastily and hurriedly continued to drop the remaining paratroopers.

    In about an hour or so, the enemy paratroop units were completely scattered and landed everywhere. Many parachutes failed to open, causing some of the enemy to fall to their deaths. Many weapons and vehicles were also destroyed in the fall. The Japanese devils who parachuted along with the American soldiers cried out sadly, "Kuso!" (Japanese for "Damn it!") and "Shimatta!" (Japanese for "We're done!").

    Our soldiers calmly aimed at the enemy as they descended, shooting and killing some of them on the spot.

    At the same time as the enemy paratroopers began to land, reinforcements from the U.S. military and the Rhee Syngman's "Kyoto Division" attacked north from the Bongseo-ri area, attempting to cover the enemy paratroop units. The battle became even more intense, but the People's Army soldiers continued to calmly confront an enemy several times their number.

    In this battle, the members of Li Zhengfan's detachment of the Kim Chang-bong detachment displayed an infinitely heroic spirit of patriotism.

    Comrade Choi Soon-ak, first platoon leader of the second battalion of the Li Zhengfan detachment, calmly commanded the company's combatants, continuing the battle for more than forty hours despite losing contact with the battalion headquarters. He appropriately used the company's firepower, flexibly moved positions, fought with five hundred enemies, repelled four enemy counterattacks, killing more than three hundred enemies and destroying many jeeps and other weapons.

    Comrade Li Se-gwan, squad leader of the first squad of the first platoon of the same company, disregarding the hail of bombs and shells from the sky and ground, accurately continued to fire on the enemy with a light machine gun, inspiring the combat will of the soldiers. Comrade Kim Ryeo-woon captured an enemy 105mm howitzer and used the enemy's shells to destroy the enemy.

    The combatants of the first battalion, responding to the call of the battalion commander to "hold the position and annihilate the enemy," fought a bloody battle with two enemy paratroop battalions for more than three hours, completely repelling the enemy's three-sided encirclement. In this battle, Comrade Han Young-chun, the light machine gunner and deputy squad leader of the first squad of the second platoon of the third company, who was responsible for the left flank on the high ground of Munji-ri, was wounded in the left arm while fighting the invading enemy, but he still persisted in fighting to the end, killing and wounding many enemies, and played an important role in repelling the enemy.

    The soldiers of the 45mm artillery company, second platoon, directly subordinate to the Li Zhengfan detachment, performed meritorious service in annihilating the enemy in combat without the coordination of infantry.

    At around 10:00 a.m. on the 23rd, about fifty enemies, with heavy and light machine guns, charged towards the high ground held by the second platoon of the directly subordinate artillery company. Under the command of Captain Hong Jun-seop, they used three men to guard the cannon, while placing another three men on the high ground, fighting the fifty enemies with cannons and hand grenades.

    At this time, a column of enemy vehicles appeared in front of the high ground, and the soldiers fired densely at the column, instantly setting more than ten enemy vehicles on fire. The enemy, suffering a heavy blow, became even more frantic, firing artillery from more than twenty tanks at the high ground held by the second platoon. However, the heroic People's Army artillery soldiers completely disregarded the enemy's artillery fire and continued to fight the enemy with cannons and hand grenades. In this battle, they killed and wounded fifty enemies, calmly and bravely holding the position.

    Comrade Li Eung-geol of the Eom Myung-soon detachment commanded a company that inflicted a devastating blow on six hundred enemies on the high ground in front of Imjin-ri. They took advantage of the high ground to lure the enemy to within forty meters, and then unleashed a fierce barrage, eliminating many enemies. Comrade Li Eung-gu, deputy squad leader of the first squad of the second platoon, bravely rushed forward and attacked the enemy with hand grenades, killing and wounding more than twenty enemies.

    The enemy launched four consecutive counterattacks up to 5:00 p.m. on the 23rd. However, Captain Li Eung-geol's bold and calm command inspired the soldiers, and they finally repelled the enemy's counterattacks, killing and wounding three hundred enemies in this battle.

    In this battle to annihilate the enemy paratroop units and their covering forces, the People's Army artillery units destroyed many enemy tanks and vehicles with accurate fire. Under the command of Captain Jo Ik-soo, the second company destroyed three enemy tanks and three enemy vehicles.

    The fierce battle continued from the 23rd to the 24th. The warriors of the Kim Chang-bong detachment displayed a spirit of infinite loyalty to the motherland and brave fighting in this battle.

    By the 24th, most of the enemy had been annihilated in this way.

    In this battle, our army units killed and wounded more than two thousand one hundred and ninety enemies, captured dozens of prisoners, destroyed nine tanks, forty-five trucks and jeeps, and shot down three enemy aircraft.

### 歼灭美军空降第一八七团

　　歼灭美军空降第一八七团
    美国空降第一八七团约三千名，于本年三月二十三日在汉城以北的汶山周围及其附近的坡州里、善有里、峰西里一带降落，企图包围朝鲜人民军部队。
    特别激起朝鲜人民愤怒的是：朝鲜人民的世仇——日本军国主义者的军队与美军伞兵一起降落，参加了作战。
    据说这群伞兵是当时美军第八军司令官李奇微亲自指挥作战的。但是，美军伞兵的这次冒险作战，是被英勇无敌的人民军所彻底粉碎了。
    在三月二十三日黎明前，金昌峰区分队的一部，经过长时间的行军后，到达了汉城以北汶山附近，并立即布置了阵地。
    天已拂晓，四周的朝雾开始消散。早晨，清静的天空，突然响起了敌机的声音。四百余架各种战斗机和轻轰炸机，像鸦群一样飞到了我军部队阵地的汶山里、坡州里、善有里、峰西里一带的上空。
    敌机在阵地上空，一面向高地、村庄和山涧进行轰炸、扫射、投汽油弹，一面投掷烟幕弹，使黑烟笼罩附近一带。这样的空袭继续了约三十分钟。
    金昌峰区分队的战斗员们，早就看透了敌机这次空袭的目的绝不单纯。
    “对敌机的任何行动不要动摇，各战斗员不要被敌人发现自己的阵地，并做好一切战斗准备。”上面的命令传到各部队来了。
    就在这时候，约一百架敌人的运输机，在战斗机和轰炸机的掩护下，盘旋了两三个圈后，开始投下降落伞。
    敌伞兵一团约三千名和一○五公厘榴弹炮、轻坦克、吉普、卡车、弹药、粮食等，系在各种颜色的降落伞上，在我军阵地上空开始降落。
    “来得正好，今天要把你们全部消灭干净！”战士们望着半空的美国伞兵，充满着胜利的信心。
    过了一会儿，敌人的伞兵已接近地面，在阵地上准备应战的人民军的战士们，便开始向降落的敌人射击。
    预计要在无人地带降落的敌人，由于遭受到了意外的打击而惊惶失措，陷于极度的混乱。这种情形使敌人进退两难：如果停止降落，则已降落在地面上的士兵就要全部被歼，因此敌人为了增援地面的伞兵，便狼狈而匆忙地继续把其余的伞兵投掷下来。
    大约有一小时左右，敌人的伞兵部队就完全分散降落在各处了。其中许多降落伞没有能张开，因而一部分敌人便跌死了。许多武器和车辆也都摔毁了。随同美国兵降落的日本鬼子们悲哀地喊叫着“库索”（日语“他妈的”）、“西马达”（日语“完蛋”）。
    我军战士每当敌人降落时，便沉着地对准敌人射击，当场把一部分敌人击毙。
    与敌伞兵开始降落的同时，美军和李承晚匪军“京都师团”的增援部队从峰西里方面向北攻来，企图掩护敌伞兵部队。战斗因此更加激烈了，但人民军战士们依然沉着地继续迎击着数倍于自己的敌人。
    在这个战斗中，金昌峰区分队的李正范区分队的队员们，发挥了无限英勇的爱国主义精神。
    李正范区分队第二大队第一中队长崔淳岳同志，在与大队本部失去联系的情况下，沉着地指挥中队战斗员，继续了四十多小时的战斗。他适当地利用中队的火力，灵活移动阵地，与五百名敌人搏斗，前后打退敌人四次反冲锋，杀敌三百余名并击毁了许多吉普车和其他武器。
    该中队一小队一分队分队长李世观同志，不顾从天上和地面来的雨雹般的炸弹和炮火，以轻机枪准确地继续射击敌人，鼓舞了战士们的战斗意志。金丽云同志缴获了敌人一○五公厘榴弹炮，以敌人的炮弹来消灭敌人。
    第一大队的战斗员们响应大队长“必须坚守阵地，痛歼敌人”的号召，与敌伞兵两个大队血战了三个多小时，完全击退了敌人的三面包围。在这个战斗中，在汶地里高地担任左翼的三中队二小队一分队的副分队长轻机枪射手韩永春同志，在与来犯的敌人搏斗时，虽左臂受了伤，依然坚持战斗到底，杀伤了许多敌人，在击退敌人的战斗中起了重要的作用。
    李正范区分队直属的四十五公厘炮中队第二小队的战士们，在没有步兵配合的战斗条件下，歼灭敌人，立了战功。
    二十三日上午十时左右，约五十名敌人以重机枪、轻机枪，向直属炮兵中队第二小队所据守的高地冲上来了。在队长洪俊燮同志的指挥下，他们以三个人守住炮，而以另外三个人布置在高地，以炮和手榴弹与五十名敌人作战。
    这时敌人汽车行列出现在高地的前方，战士便向汽车行列密集射击，一瞬间十余辆敌人汽车便中弹起火。遭受了沉重打击的敌人更加疯狂，以二十余辆坦克上的炮火向第二小队据守的高地上轰击。但是，英勇的人民军炮兵战士完全不顾敌人的炮火，继续以炮和手榴弹与敌人战斗。他们在这个战斗里杀伤了敌人五十名，沉着勇敢地守住了阵地。
    严明顺区分队的李应杰同志指挥的中队，在临津里的前山高地，给予六百名敌人以歼灭性打击。他们利用高地，把敌人引诱到四十公尺的距离，一齐向敌人猛烈射击，消灭了不少敌人。二小队一分队副分队长李应九同志，奋身向前，以手榴弹打击敌人，杀伤敌人二十多个。
    敌人至二十三日下午五时为止，前后连续进行了四次反冲锋。但是，李应杰中队长的大胆和沉着的指挥，鼓舞着战士们，终于击退了敌人的反冲锋，并在这战斗中杀伤了三百个敌人。
    在这次歼灭敌伞兵部队和其掩护部队的战斗中，人民军的炮兵部队以准确的射击，击毁了敌人许多坦克和汽车。二中队在队长赵益寿同志的指挥下，就击毁了敌人的三辆坦克和三辆汽车。
    激烈的战斗，一直由二十三日继续到二十四日。金昌峰区分队的勇士们，在这次战斗中，发挥了对祖国无限忠诚和勇敢战斗的精神。
    二十四日为止，大部敌人就这样被歼灭了。
    我军部队在这次战斗中，杀伤了二千一百九十多名敌人，俘虏了数十名，炸毁九辆坦克、四十五辆卡车和吉普车，并击落三架敌机。
