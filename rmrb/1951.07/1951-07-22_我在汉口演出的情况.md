　　My Performance Situation in Hankou
　　Mei Lanfang
    Editor's Note: This article is an excerpt from a letter from Mr. Mei Lanfang to responsible comrades of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government.
    I was in Hankou for two months and performed more than fifty shows (from April 23rd to June 1st—Editor). In addition to evening parties for various agencies and troops, I also performed a charity performance for the Hankou fire disaster, two performances to show respect for workers, two charity performances for the "Lu Xun" airplane (raising more than 100 million yuan), and a demonstration performance for all the city's opera workers. Every week, I added matinee performances to entertain cadres from various agencies. My child, Baojiu, performed a show at the Army Hospital for seriously wounded volunteers returning from the Korean battlefield. Originally, I planned to perform for them myself, but because that day was the "Donate a Plane" charity performance and I couldn't make it in time, I asked Baojiu to perform on my behalf. This kind of performance is very meaningful. It gives children and soldiers a chance to get close. Baojiu told me after the performance that he was very moved when he saw these loyal and brave soldiers on stage. The repertoire performed in Hankou all followed the principles instructed by the State Council and the Ministry of Culture. Some plays with anti-people elements were abandoned (such as plays like "Huang Tianba"), some plays with minor problems were partially revised before being performed, and plays with more significance were performed several times. "Resisting the Jin Troops" was greatly revised before being staged, and it received the help and support of comrades in Wuhan who were responsible for opera reform, so the general feedback after the performance was not bad. After the performances, I originally planned to stay in Hankou for a few days to observe and investigate the development of some local operas, but after the two performances to show respect for workers, I became fatigued and contracted the flu and tracheitis, and my voice became hoarse. Then, the three evening parties that the Political Department of the Fourth Field Army had arranged long ago were all vocal performances, so I temporarily changed "Woman's Release" to another play (I had partially revised "Woman's Release," removing the section of bidding farewell to prison, so I was asked to perform this play). During the break, a soldier came on stage to explain the reason for my illness and the change of play, which everyone understood. It was originally scheduled to perform three shows in Wuchang after the performances in Hankou to entertain model workers and combat heroes, but later Chairman Li Xiannian heard that I was ill and sent someone to notify the cancellation of these three shows. I was able to complete the mission of the "Donate a Plane" charity performance because I got these three days of rest. I am truly moved by the leaders' concern for my health. Various local operas in Hankou, such as Han Opera, Chu Opera, and Peking Opera, are actively rehearsing new plays to cooperate with the current tasks and are engaged in competitions with very high spirits. The Chu Opera "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" and the Han Opera "Blood Debt Must Be Paid in Blood" are both very vivid and realistic, and their future development is unlimited. I asked the Hubei Federation of Literary and Art Circles to find some scripts of local operas, and I also interviewed some materials, which I will bring to Beijing and hand over to the Chinese Academy of Traditional Opera for preservation. I originally planned to return to Beijing after the performances, but now I have to go to Shanghai for treatment because of my illness.

### 我在汉口演出的情况

　　我在汉口演出的情况
　　梅兰芳
    编者按：本文是梅兰芳先生致中央人民政府文化部负责同志的一封信的摘录。
    我在汉口两月，共演五十余场（从四月二十三日起到六月一日止——编者）。除各机关部队晚会而外，又为汉口大火灾义演了一场，为优待工人表演两场，为鲁迅号飞机义演两场（得款一亿余），为全市戏曲工作者观摩演出一场，每逢星期为招待各机关干部加演日场，我的孩子葆玖为朝鲜战地归来的重伤志愿军在陆军医院表演了一场。本来我准备自己演给他们看，因是日为献机义演时间赶不过来，故嘱葆玖代演。这种表演是很有意义的。借此叫小孩子和战士们有一个接近的机会。葆玖演完回来告诉我，他在台上看到这些忠勇的战士，心里非常感动。在汉口上演剧目，均系遵照政务院及文化部指示的方针，将一部分含有反人民的成份的戏放弃不演（如黄天霸一类的戏），有点小问题加以部份修改后演出，比较有点意义的多演几次。“抗金兵”是经过大修改而后上演，得到了武汉市负责戏曲改革工作的同志的帮助和支持，所以演出后一般反映还不错。我本想演完以后，个人在汉口住几天，观摩考察一些地方戏的发展情况，可是当我演毕优待工人的两场以后，因身体疲劳，得了流行感冒气管炎，嗓子哑了，接着四野政治部早就约定的三个晚会，都是唱工戏，临时将“女起解”改旁的戏（按“女起解”我有部分的修改，将辞别狱禁一节删去，所以要求我演这出）。在休息的时候，由一位战士登场说明我的抱病登台所以改戏的缘故，大家都很谅解，本定在汉口演毕到武昌演三场，招待劳动模范及战斗英雄，后来李先念主席听见我病了，派人来通知取消了这三场戏。我得到这三天休息，才可能完成献机义演的任务。首长们这样关心我的健康，真是使人感动。汉口市的各种地方戏，如汉剧、楚剧，以及京剧，都在积极排演配合当前任务的新戏，展开竞赛，情绪非常高昂。楚剧的《太平天国》，和汉剧的《血债血还》，都非常生动而逼真，前途发展未可限量。我托湖北文联找了一些地方戏的本子，同时也采访了一些资料，将来带到北京交与中国戏曲研究院保存。我原定演毕返京，现因病只得到上海疗治。
