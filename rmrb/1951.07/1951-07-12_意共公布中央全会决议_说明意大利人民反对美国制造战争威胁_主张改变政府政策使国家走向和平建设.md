　　Xinhua News Agency, Rome: The resolution of the Italian Communist Party Central Committee plenum was released in Rome on the 10th. The resolution discussed the results of the recent elections for the provincial and municipal councils of Italy's fifty-seven provinces and the Sicilian Regional Assembly, saying: "The Central Committee expresses its approval of the resolute and vigorous actions of the democratic forces in carrying out the election struggle, and expresses its satisfaction with the brilliant victories achieved by the people's parties in the elections. Despite all the persecution during the election campaign and the illegal interference by the authorities and priests, 'forty percent of Italians still fully support the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the democratic groups allied with them in the common program of peace and construction.'"
    The resolution said: "The election results show that the policies of the Christian Democratic Party have aroused extreme dissatisfaction and concern in Italy. The war threats manufactured by American imperialists and their vassal states have deeply shaken the majority of the Italian people. Voters have voiced their opposition to this dangerous and serious situation and demanded a fundamental change in the government's current policies, so that Italy can embark on a new path of peace, construction, and friendship with all countries."
    The Central Committee is deeply aware that, due to the increasingly broad support of the people for the Communist Party, its responsibilities have become even greater. Therefore, it calls on workers, peasants, and all middle-class people engaged in production to "bravely and resolutely promote the cause of establishing a broad and powerful democratic national force group, a group that can save the motherland and ensure that the will of the people is respected."
    The resolution put forward the Communist Party's practical demands, calling for guarantees of "changes in the institutions and life" of the country. These demands are: to implement control over the sectors of the Italian economy that manipulate the national economy and people's livelihoods, to implement land reform, to improve the living standards of workers, employees, and those receiving pensions, and to establish a government that can pursue a policy of peace in Italy. In order to realize these demands, the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party especially calls on all working people of Italy to "consolidate the unity of the working class, strengthen the concerted action of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, and the unity with all labor forces."

　　意共公布中央全会决议
    说明意大利人民反对美国制造战争威胁
    主张改变政府政策使国家走向和平建设
    【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社罗马讯：意大利共产党中央委员会全体会议的决议于十日在罗马公布。决议论到意大利不久以前举行的意大利五十七个省的省、市政委员会选举和西西里区议会选举的结果说：中央委员会对于坚决大力地进行选举斗争的民主力量的行动表示赞许，对于各人民党派在选举中取得的光辉胜利表示满意。尽管有竞选运动中的一切迫害及当局和神父的非法干涉，“百分之四十的意大利人仍全力支持共产党、社会党及与它们结成联盟的民主集团所共同提出的和平与建设的纲领。”
    决议说：选举结果表明基督教民主党的政策已在意大利引起了极度的不满和忧惧。美帝国主义者和它们的附庸国所制造出来的战争威胁，深深地震动了意大利大多数人民。选民发出呼声，反对这种充满了危险的严重形势，并要求根本改变政府目前的政策，使意大利走上和平、建设与各国友好的新道路。
    中央委员会深知：由于人民对共产党的支持日益广泛，它的责任也就愈加重大，因此，它号召工人、农民和一切参与生产工作的中产阶级的人民“勇敢而坚决地促进建立广泛的、强大的民主民族力量集团的事业，这样一个集团能挽救祖国，并使人民的意志得到尊重。”
    决议提出了共产党的实际要求，要求保证在国家的“机构和生活中能有所改变”。这些要求就是：对意大利经济中操纵国计民生的部分实行管制，实行土地改革，改善工人、雇员和领受年金的人的生活水准，成立一个能在意大利奉行和平政策的政府。为了实现这些要求，意大利共产党中央委员会特号召意大利全体劳动人民“巩固工人阶级的团结，加强共产党与社会党的一致行动及与一切劳工力量的团结。”（附图片）
