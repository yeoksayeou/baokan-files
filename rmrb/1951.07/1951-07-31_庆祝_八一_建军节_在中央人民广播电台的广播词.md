　　Celebrating "August 1st" Army Day
　  ——Radio Address on the Central People's Broadcasting Station
　　Guo Moruo
　　As we welcome the glorious and great 24th anniversary of the "August 1st" Army Day, I now, on behalf of the China Resist-America Aid-Korea General Association, which is also the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, extend warm congratulations and high respect to all comrades of the revolutionary armed forces of China—the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and the Public Security Forces!
　　Chairman Mao said: "Without a people's army, the people have nothing." All of us in China deeply understand this incisive reminder from Chairman Mao, and we will do our utmost to support our great revolutionary army. Under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, our revolutionary army, after more than twenty years of arduous struggle, annihilated the counter-revolutionary armed forces of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, totaling 8.07 million, overthrew the reactionary rule of feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism, and expelled the aggressive forces of imperialism, making our motherland a people's democratic republic where the people are the masters. Today, our motherland is not only a great stabilizing force in the East but also an important cornerstone of the global peace and democracy camp. We should thank Chairman Mao, thank the Chinese Communist Party, and thank all our revolutionary armed comrades.
　　Our people's revolutionary army is a great military force, and at the same time, it is also a great political force, cultural force, and production force. Under strict discipline, our revolutionary armed comrades are closely connected with the masses of the people, and they are excellent organizers and propagandists for the people. Wherever our revolutionary army goes, Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought go, and revolutionary cultural education goes. Under the conditions permitted by military tasks, our revolutionary army not only helps the working people to carry out production but also takes on huge production and construction tasks on its own with great organizational strength. All of us in China take immense pride in having such a glorious people's army.
　　The great victory of our people's revolution has world significance, and the great victory achieved by our Chinese People's Volunteer Army fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army in Korea also has world significance. We must consolidate our victory, expand our victory, and build our motherland well, transforming it from an agricultural country into an industrialized country, and steadily moving from the construction of New Democracy to the construction of socialism and communism. To accomplish this sacred task, we must first strengthen our national defense and make our people's army a stronger and fully modernized national defense force. Only in this way can the fruits of our revolutionary victory be guaranteed, and the work of our national construction can be guaranteed.
　　Although our enemies have been defeated by us, they have not given up. In particular, our most stubborn enemy at present, American imperialism, is still trying every possible means to obstruct our construction and sabotage our construction. On the one hand, it is妄想(wang xiang) trying to prolong its hopeless aggressive behavior in Korea,妄想(wang xiang) trying to separately conclude peace with Japan, and openly rearming Japan; on the other hand, it is stubbornly supporting the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang, occupying our Taiwan, and colluding with the remaining counter-revolutionary forces in our country, attempting to carry out sabotage work from within. American imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people and the mortal enemy of the people of the world. As long as its policy of aggression is not eliminated, our struggle against aggression cannot be relaxed for a single day. We must use our increasingly strengthened strength to oppose the aggression of American imperialism, resolutely suppress and thoroughly eliminate the remaining counter-revolutionary forces in the country, and safeguard the security of our motherland and international security.
　　Today, it is worth comforting all comrades that the level of political awareness of all the Chinese people has been universally improved, and the love of all the Chinese people for the motherland has reached an unprecedented climax. Since the launch of the Resist-America Aid-Korea movement, more than 80 percent of our compatriots in China have received patriotic ideological education. Today, we are striving for comprehensive popularization and moving from the stage of popularization to the stage of in-depth development. We must make everyone have ardent patriotic emotions, and everyone's patriotic emotions must be expressed as concrete patriotic actions. The people's patriotic actions today have already had many concrete manifestations. The land reform has been completed in an area with a population of 290 million. The work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries is being carried out vigorously and resolutely throughout the country. Workers and peasants have taken out the attitude of masters and are enthusiastically increasing production. Taking the production of cotton and grain as an example, the output in 1950 has approached the highest level before the war, and this year it is prepared to exceed it. Taking the production of heavy industry as an example, the total output in 1950 reached 325 percent of that in 1949. Transportation has been restored, trade has prospered, and the financial economy has been unified and stabilized. These are all obvious to all.
　　It is also worth comforting all comrades that the three major appeals issued by our China Resist-America Aid-Korea General Association on June 1st have received enthusiastic and universal responses from the people of the country in just two months. Our three major appeals are to have the people of the whole country universally establish patriotic pacts and earnestly implement them, to have the people of the whole country work hard to increase production to donate weapons, and to have the people of the whole country universally carry out consolation to the families of revolutionary armymen and revolutionary martyrs. Where is the enthusiastic response manifested? The enthusiastic response is manifested in the numbers of increased production and donations. As of July 23, the donation of airplanes alone has reached 2,253. The enthusiastic response is manifested in the voting movement against American imperialism rearming Japan, with a total of 339,658,730 people, accounting for 71.5 percent of the total population of the country. The enthusiastic response is manifested in the signature campaign to support the conclusion of a peace treaty by the five major powers, with a total of 343,808,541 people, accounting for 72.4 percent of the total population of the country. The enthusiastic response is even more manifested in the enthusiastic participation of young students in military cadre schools. Last year, the movement to participate in military cadre schools enrolled 40,000 students, and the number of applicants was six or seven times that number. This year it is even more enthusiastic, with more than 330,000 people already applying. These fully prove that the level of political awareness of the Chinese people has been universally improved, and the great significance of national defense construction has been universally recognized.
　　But we believe that these achievements are only preliminary achievements. We must continue to work hard to make our movement more in-depth and our achievements more expanded. In particular, we are stepping up our efforts in the work of consoling, giving preferential treatment to, and providing pensions for the families of revolutionary martyrs, the families of revolutionary armymen, and revolutionary disabled soldiers. Revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary armymen are great heroes of the motherland, good examples for the people, and creators and defenders of the happiness and glory enjoyed by all the Chinese people today. We must take revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary armymen as models, love our motherland with the same spirit of self-sacrifice, love the creators and defenders of the motherland, and repay the creators and defenders of the motherland by doing a good job in preferential treatment. Our China Resist-America Aid-Korea General Association has already issued a notice on July 4, requiring all cities and villages in China to conduct a comprehensive and practical inspection of the work of preferential treatment and pensions within one week before and after the Army Day, and to launch a mass movement. The editorial "We Must Do a Good Job in Preferential Treatment Work" in the *People's Daily* on July 22 further describes the great significance and implementation steps of this work in a very sincere and detailed manner. We believe that in today's unprecedented upsurge of patriotic enthusiasm, all of us in China will invariably attach importance to this work and will do this work well with unlimited enthusiasm.
　　Glory belongs to the creators and defenders of the motherland!
　　Eternal glory to the martyrs who sacrificed for the motherland!
　　Long live our motherland!
　　Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
　　Long live Chairman Mao!

　　庆祝“八一”建军节
　  ——在中央人民广播电台的广播词
　　郭沫若
    我们迎接到光荣伟大的“八一”建军节第二十四周年，我现在代表抗美援朝总会，也就是中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会，向全中国的革命武装部队——中国人民解放军、中国人民志愿军、公安部队的全体同志，致热诚的庆贺和崇高的敬礼！
    毛主席说过：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”我们全中国人民都深切地体会到毛主席的这个剀切的提示，我们要竭尽我们的热诚来拥护我们的伟大的革命军队。我们的革命军队，在毛主席和中国共产党的正确领导之下，经过了二十多年的艰苦奋斗，消灭了蒋介石匪帮八百零七万人的反革命武装力量，推翻了封建主义与官僚资本主义的反动统治，驱逐了帝国主义的侵略势力，使我们的祖国成为了人民作主人的人民民主共和国。我们的祖国在今天不仅是东方的一个伟大的安定力量，而且是全世界和平民主阵营的一个重要的柱石了。我们应该感谢毛主席，感谢中国共产党，感谢我们全体的革命武装同志。
    我们的人民革命的军队，是一个伟大的军事力量，而同时也是一个伟大的政治力量、文化力量、生产力量。我们的革命的武装同志们在严明的纪律之下，紧密地联系着人民大众，是人民大众极好的组织者和宣传者。我们的革命军队所到的地方，便是马克思、列宁主义和毛主席思想所到的地方，革命的文化教育所到的地方。在军事任务许可的条件之下，我们的革命军队不仅在帮助劳动人民进行生产，而且以伟大的组织力量在自行担负着巨大的生产建设任务。我们全中国人民以有这样辉煌的人民军队为无上的光荣。
    我们的人民革命的伟大胜利是具有世界意义的，我们的中国人民志愿部队在朝鲜境内和朝鲜人民军并肩作战所获得的伟大胜利同样是具有世界意义的。我们要巩固我们的胜利，扩大我们的胜利，要把我们的祖国好好地建设起来，由农业的国家转化成工业化的国家，稳步地通过新民主主义的建设而走向社会主义、共产主义的建设。要想完成这个神圣的任务，我们首先就必须要更加巩固我们的国防，要使我们的人民的军队成为更加强大的完全现代化的国防军。要这样，我们的革命胜利的果实才能有保障，我们的国家建设的工作也才能有保障。
    我们的敌人虽然被我们打败了，但他们还没有死心。特别是我们当前的最顽恶的一个敌人，美帝国主义，它还在想尽种种方法来阻挠我们的建设，破坏我们的建设。它一方面在妄想拖延在朝鲜境内的毫无出路的侵略行为，妄想单独和日本媾和，明目张胆地重新武装日本；另一方面又死死地支持蒋介石残余匪帮，霸占着我们的台湾，和我们国内的反革命残余力量勾结，企图从内部来从事破坏工作。美帝国主义是我们中国人民的死敌，是全世界人民的死敌，它的侵略政策一天不消灭，我们的反抗侵略的斗争是一天也不能松懈的。我们必须用日益加强的力量来反对美帝国主义的侵略，坚决镇压并彻底消灭国内的反革命残余力量，保卫我们祖国的安全和国际的安全。
    今天值得向各位同志们告慰的，是我们全中国人民的政治觉悟的水平已经普遍地提高了，我们全中国人民对于祖国的热爱已经达到了空前未有的高潮。自从抗美援朝的运动发动以来，全中国已经有百分之八十以上的同胞接受了爱国主义的思想教育，在今天我们正在努力争取全面的普及，并由普及的阶段进入到深入的阶段。我们要使每一个人都要具有热烈的爱国情绪，而每一个人的爱国情绪都要表现而为具体的爱国行动。人民的爱国行动在今天是已经有了不少的具体的表现的。土地改革已经在二亿九千万人口的区域完成了。镇压反革命的工作在全国范围内，正在大张旗鼓地雷厉风行。工人农民都拿出了主人翁的态度，在热烈地增加生产。拿棉花和粮食的生产来说，一九五○年的产量已经接近了战前的最高水平，今年更准备超过。拿重工业的生产来说，一九五○年的总产量达到了一九四九年的百分之三百二十五。交通恢复了，贸易繁荣了，财政经济统一而稳定了，这都是有目共睹的事。
    还有值得向各位同志们告慰的，是我们抗美援朝总会在六月一日所发出的三大号召，为时仅仅两个月，已经得到了全国人民的热烈的普遍的响应。我们的三大号召，是要全国人民普遍订立爱国公约而且切实地执行，是要全国人民努力增加生产，用以捐献武器，是要全国人民普遍地进行慰劳革命军人家属和革命烈士家属。热烈的响应表现在什么地方呢？热烈的响应表现在增产捐献的数目字上，到七月二十三日为止，单是飞机的捐献已经达到二千二百五十三架了。热烈的响应表现在反对美帝国主义重新武装日本的投票运动上，全人数是三亿三千九百六十五万八千七百三十人，占全国人口总数百分之七十一点五。热烈的响应表现在拥护五大国缔结和平公约的签名运动上，全人数是三亿四千三百八十万八千五百四十一人，占全国人口总数百分之七十二点四。热烈的响应更表现在青年学生参加军事干部学校的踊跃上，去年的参加军事干部学校运动收录了学生四万名，而报名的人数有六七倍，今年是更加踊跃，报名的已有三十三万多人了。这些都充分证明我们中国人民政治觉悟的水平普遍地提高，对于国防建设的重大意义已经有了普遍的认识。
    但这些成就，我们认为还只是初步的成就。我们还要不断地努力使我们的运动更加深入，成就更加扩大特别是对于革命烈士家属、革命军人家属和革命荣誉军人的慰劳、优待和抚恤的工作，我们正在加紧努力。革命烈士和革命军人是祖国的大功臣，是人民的好榜样，是今天全中国人民所享受到的幸福和光荣的创造者和保卫者，我们一定要以革命烈士和革命军人为模范，以同样的自我牺牲的精神来热爱我们的祖国，热爱祖国的创造者和保卫者，以做好优抚工作来报答祖国的创造者和保卫者。我们抗美援朝总会在七月四日已经发出了通知，要全中国所有的城市和乡村，在建军节的前后各一星期之内，对于优待和抚恤工作作一次全面的切实检查，并展开群众性的运动。《人民日报》七月二十二日的社论《必须做好优抚工作》，更把这一工作的重大意义和实行步骤，叙述得非常恳切详细。我们相信，在今天爱国热情空前未有的高潮中，我们全中国人民一定会无例外地重视这项工作，而且会以无限的热诚来把这项工作作好。
    光荣属于祖国的创造者和保卫者！
    为祖国而牺牲的烈士们永垂不朽！
    我们的祖国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
