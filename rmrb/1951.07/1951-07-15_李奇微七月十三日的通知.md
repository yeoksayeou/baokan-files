Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 14th: The following is Ridgway's notification of July 13th:
To General Kim Il Sung and General Peng Dehuai:

　　In my initial notification to you on June 30th, I suggested that representatives meet on a Danish hospital ship. I suggested this location because it would allow both sides equal freedom of access, including personnel such as journalists from either side. This location would provide a completely neutral atmosphere, without the presence of armed forces from either side to create a threatening effect.

　　This location would also provide ample communications equipment. Your response to my notification did not mention the meeting place I suggested; instead, you suggested Kaesong as the meeting place.

　　In order to expedite the end of the bloodshed and to demonstrate the sincerity of the United Nations Command, I accepted Kaesong as the location for our talks.

　　In doing so, I hoped that the conditions mentioned above, which are extremely important for the success of such talks, would be fully met in Kaesong.

　　To further ensure that the meeting place actually possessed these conditions, my liaison officer, at the preliminary meeting with your liaison officer on July 8th, suggested establishing a ten-mile-wide corridor along the Kimchon-Kaesong-Munsan highway, extending north to Kimchon and south to Munsan-ri, as a neutral area, in which both sides would cease all hostilities. They further suggested that the United Nations forces in this corridor withdraw south of an east-west line along the southern boundary of Kaesong, and that your forces withdraw north of an east-west line along the northern boundary of Kaesong, leaving Kaesong vacant. Only personnel from the negotiating delegations would be allowed to enter.

　　If an agreement were reached on this proposal, it would guarantee the freedom of movement for both delegations to and from the meetings and within Kaesong. However, your liaison officer rejected this proposal, saying that there was no need to guarantee satisfactory conditions for both delegations at the meeting place. To show sincerity and avoid delay, I no longer insisted on establishing a neutral zone and accepted your assurances. Since the beginning of the meetings, the facts have shown that the treatment of both sides is unequal, and equal treatment is necessary for conducting armistice negotiations. Since the first meeting in Kaesong, your delegation has placed restrictions on the movements of our delegation. Your delegation has placed our personnel under the strict guard of your armed guards, harassed our couriers and obstructed their passage.

　　Although your delegation has agreed to immediately establish communication links with our base, it has failed to cooperate. Your delegation has refused to allow certain personnel in our convoy to enter the meeting place, personnel whom I wished to be present, and I have stated that I take full responsibility for their actions.

　　The current extension of the recess and the delay in our delegation's ability to resume the meeting are entirely due to these unreasonable and unnecessary restrictions, against which my representatives have repeatedly protested.

　　Lieutenant General Joye, my own representative who participated in the first meeting on July 10th, pointed out to your representatives that the hope for the success of these negotiations rests entirely on the sincerity of both sides. If both sides are sincere, mutual trust can be established, a genuine atmosphere can be created, and a glorious and lasting solution can be greatly approached.

　　The actions of the United Nations Command delegation to date are open to inspection by the entire world. It undeniably proves their upright intentions and sincerity at every stage of the meeting. The United Nations Command delegation fully and seriously recognizes the immense importance of our meeting to the people of the world and is prepared to continue our talks at any time in the same spirit of sincerity, provided that we are assured that your delegation will act in the same spirit.

　　The guarantees I require are simple and minimal. These guarantees include establishing a mutually agreed meeting area of appropriate size, completely free of armed personnel from either side. This is the primary prerequisite. Both delegations must receive completely identical treatment, including complete and equal freedom of movement to and from the mutually agreed meeting area and within that area, and complete and equal freedom to choose their own delegation members at any time, including representatives of the press.

　　Therefore, I now propose that we agree to demarcate a circular area as a neutral zone, roughly centered on Kaesong, with a radius of five miles. The eastern boundary of this neutral zone would be Panmunjom, the current contact point of our forces. I propose that we both agree not to engage in any hostilities within this neutral zone throughout our meeting. I propose that we agree that the meeting area and the roads used by both delegations to travel to and from the area shall be completely free of armed personnel.

　　I further propose that we both agree that the total number of personnel from each delegation within this neutral zone shall not exceed one hundred and fifty at any time. I propose that we agree that the composition of each delegation within the above limit shall be determined entirely by the commander of that side. And it is agreed that the personnel permitted to enter the actual meeting room shall be limited to those agreed upon by your representatives and my representatives.

　　If you agree to these proposals, the current recess can be terminated, and the meeting can be resumed without delay and with the prospect of progress. Your reply can be communicated to me by radio telephone.

　　If you wish to send a liaison officer to deliver your reply, I guarantee his safety within our lines during the day, provided you notify me of the time, the route he will take, and the identification marks.

　　If you continue to insist that restrictions are necessary for the safety of our personnel or for any other reason, I suggest that the meeting address be moved to a location that can provide the few simple guarantees I have listed in this notification.

　　　　Commander-in-Chief, United Nations Command, General of the Army, United States Army

　　　　Ridgway (Signed)

### 李奇微七月十三日的通知

　　李奇微七月十三日的通知
    【新华社平壤十四日电】下面是李奇微七月十三日的通知：金日成将军和彭德怀将军：
    在我六月三十日初次给你们的通知里，我曾建议代表们在一艘丹麦医院船上会晤。我所以建议这个地点，是因为那样可使双方都有同等的出入自由，包括属于任何一方的新闻记者这种人士在内。这种地点可以有一种完全中立的气氛，不致有任何一方的武装部队在场而产生威胁的作用。
    这种地点也可以提供充分的各种通讯设备。你们对我的通知的答复没有提到我所建议的会晤地点，相反的，你们建议以开城为会议地点。
    为了促使流血战争早日结束，并表明联合国军司令部的行动出于诚意，我接受了以开城为我们会谈的地点。
    在我这样做的时候，我原希望上述对于这种会谈的成功极为重要的条件，在开城能够完全具备。
    为了进一步保证会议地点事实上具备这种条件，我的联络官在七月八日与你们的联络官举行预备会议时，曾建议沿着金川——开城——汶山公路建立一道十英里宽的走廊，北至金川南至汶山里，作为中立地区，在这地区双方均停止任何敌对行动。他们更建议，在这个走廊内的联合国军队退至开城南界的东西向一线以南，而你们的军队则退至开城北界东西向一线以北，让出开城。只有谈判代表团的人员方能入内。
    如果就这个建议达成协议，便可以保证双方代表团在出席会议时往返途中及在开城市内行动自由。然而，你们的联络官却拒绝这个建议，说无须在会议地点为双方代表团保证满意的条件。为了表示诚意并避免耽延，我不再坚持建立中立区的建议，而接受了你们的保证。自从会议开始以来，事实表明双方的待遇是不平等的，而平等待遇是进行停战谈判所必需的。自从开城的第一次会议以来，你们的代表团对我方代表团的行动加以限制。你们代表团使我方人员处于你们武装卫队的严密警卫之下，留难我方信差并阻挠其通行。
    你们代表团虽然已同意立即建立与我方基地的来往通讯联络，但是却又不予以合作。你们代表团拒绝允许我方车队内的某些人员进入会议地点，而这些人员是我所愿意他们前去的，我并已声明我对他们的行为负全部责任。
    目前会议休会时间的延长和我方代表团迟迟没有能够恢复会议，完全是由于这些无理和不必要的限制，我的代表对这些限制已屡次提出抗议。
    参加七月十日的第一次会议的我本人的代表乔埃中将已向你方代表指出，这次谈判成功的希望完全寄托在双方的诚意上。如果双方都有诚意，就可以建立互信，造成真诚的气氛，并使光荣而持久的解决大为接近。
    联合国军司令部代表团到现在为止的行为，可以任凭全世界检查。它令人无可置疑地证明他们在会议的每一个阶段中的正大光明的意图和诚意。联合国军司令部代表团充分而严肃地认识到我们的会议对全世界人民的极大重要性，准备随时本着同样的诚意的精神，随时继续进行我们的会谈，只要我方得到保证你们的代表团将按照同样的精神行事。
    我要求的保证是简单而微少的。这些保证包括建立一个双方同意的会议地区，有适当面积，完全没有任何一方的武装人员。这是首要的先决条件。双方代表团必须受到完全一样的待遇，包括往返双方同意的会议地区和在这个地区以内行动的完全而平等的自由，和在任何时候都有选择自己的代表团一行人员的完全而平等的自由，包括报界代表在内。
    因此，我现在建议彼此协议划定一个圆形地区为中立区，这地区大致以开城的中心为圆心，半径为五英里。这个中立区的东面以我们的部队目前的接触地点板门店为界。我建议，我们双方同意在我们整个会议期间在这个中立区内不得从事任何敌对行动。我建议，我们同意会议地区和双方代表团一行人员前往该地区所经过的各条公路完全不驻扎武装人员。
    我还建议，我们双方同意每一方代表团在这个中立区之内的人员总数任何时候最多不得超过一百五十人。我建议，我们同意每方的代表团在上述限度内的人员构成应完全由该方司令官决定。并约定准许进入实际会议室的人员，应限于经你们的代表和我的代表所同意的人员。
    如果你方同意这些建议，目前的休会即可终止，会议即可恢复，不致迟延，而且可望有所进展。你方的答复可用无线电电话通知我。
    如果你们愿意派联络官把你们的答复送来，我保证日间他在我方防线之内的安全。只要你们把时间、他所走的路线以及辨认他的标识通知我。
    如果你们继续坚持为了我方人员的安全或其他任何理由而有限制的必要，我建议把会议地址移到一个可以提供我在这通知内所列举的几个简单保证的地点。
          联合国军总司令、美国陆军上将
            李奇微（签字）
