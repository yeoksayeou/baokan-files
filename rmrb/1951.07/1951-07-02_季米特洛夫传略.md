Biography of Dimitrov

　　July 2nd marks the second anniversary of the death of Dimitrov, the leader of the Bulgarian people and an outstanding leader of the international workers' movement. Dimitrov was born on June 18, 1882. He came from a printing worker's family and joined the revolutionary movement at the age of fifteen. At the age of eighteen, he was elected secretary of the Printing Workers' Union. In 1902, Dimitrov became a Social Democrat and firmly stood on the side of the revolutionaries. In 1919, this revolutionary faction, under the leadership of Dimitrov, was reorganized into the Bulgarian Communist Party, and later joined the Communist International. In September 1923, Dimitrov moved abroad to participate in the leadership of the international communist movement, and served as the secretary of the Balkan Communist Alliance. At the end of 1923, Dimitrov launched a struggle against fascism in Vienna, and continued to lead this struggle. His famous work "Fascism - This is War" was widely circulated and had a great impact. In March 1933, the German fascists fabricated the crime of "burning the Reichstag" and tried Dimitrov in the Leipzig court. In court, he exposed Hitler's arson conspiracy, promoted communism, and set an example for communists to fight bravely in enemy courts. Due to the strong momentum of the international solidarity movement, Dimitrov was released from prison in 1934. In 1935, Dimitrov was elected as the General Secretary of the Executive Committee of the Communist International at the Seventh Congress of the Communist International. Until the dissolution of the Communist International in May 1943, he made outstanding contributions to the international communist movement. Throughout his tenure in the leadership of the Communist International, Dimitrov paid close attention to the Chinese revolution. From 1937 to 1939, under the call of the Communist International, the working classes of various countries gave valuable sympathy and assistance to the Chinese people and soldiers who were fighting against Japan. In 1936, on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, Dimitrov wrote an article focusing on the issue of the Chinese Communist Party's national united front policy. In November 1945, Dimitrov returned to Bulgaria to lead the construction work, serving as the General Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Prime Minister of Bulgaria. In 1949, he went to the Soviet Union for medical treatment due to a serious illness and died. (Xinhua News Agency) (with picture)
