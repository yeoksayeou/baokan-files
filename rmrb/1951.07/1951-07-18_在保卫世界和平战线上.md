　　On the Frontline of Defending World Peace
  American People Support Korean Armistice Negotiations
    For a year, the American imperialist war of aggression in Korea has brought many disasters to the American people, threatening their peaceful and economic lives. The broad masses of the American people are urgently demanding an end to this bloody war of imperialism. They have expressed warm support for Malik's proposal for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and eagerly hope for the early completion of the armistice negotiations currently underway in Kaesong.
    The "American Peace Crusade," an organization representing peace-loving people from all walks of life in the United States, telegraphed Truman on July 11, demanding the speedy completion of the Korean armistice negotiations and suggesting that after the negotiations, the major powers should discuss and resolve all Far Eastern issues. The American people from all walks of life are expected to send one million telegrams to Truman. In addition, the "American Peace Crusade" will also hold 100,000 peace rallies across the country and send delegations to visit officials of the United Nations and the United States government.
    The growing peace movement of the American people is powerfully striking at the American government's policy of attempting to continue aggression and war.
  Japanese People Oppose Separate Peace
    As the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries intensify their conspiracy to conclude a separate peace and rearm Japan, more and more Japanese people have signed declarations demanding a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan. According to the Japanese Peace Protection Committee, the number of people who have signed in support of a comprehensive peace treaty has reached two million. Many people in Japanese business and industry have realized that a separate peace is not their way out. If normal trade with New China is not conducted, Japan's national industry and commerce cannot prosper. Therefore, most people in Japanese business and industry support the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan.
  French and Italian People Demand Peace
    After the French and Italian Communist Parties won great victories in the parliamentary elections, striking at the conspiracies of imperialism and its running dogs, they have further put forward the proposition of defending world peace. The French Communist Party's parliamentary group has submitted many bills to the French National Assembly, demanding measures to improve the lives of working people and demanding the conclusion of a five-power peace pact. The resolution of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party calls on workers, peasants, and people from all walks of life to strengthen broad unity, demand that the government respect the will of the people, implement democratic reforms, improve people's lives, and pursue a policy of peace. The many propositions put forward by the French and Italian Communist Parties once again demonstrate that they are the only parties that represent and fight for the interests of the French and Italian people.

　　在保卫世界和平战线上
  美国人民拥护朝鲜停战谈判
    一年来，美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的战争，给美国人民带来了许多灾难，使他们的和平生活与经济生活感受到威胁，广大的美国人民，迫切要求结束帝国主义的这个血腥的战争。他们对于马立克提出的和平解决朝鲜问题的建议，都表示热烈的支持，并且热望现在在开城举行的停战谈判早日完成。
    代表美国各阶层爱好和平人民的“美国和平十字军”组织，已在七月十一日打电报给杜鲁门，要求尽速使朝鲜停战谈判完成，并建议在谈判之后，各大国应讨论并解决一切远东问题。美国各阶层人民预定要发给杜鲁门的电报将达一百万份。除此之外，“美国和平十字军”还要在全国各地举行十万次的和平集会，并将派遣代表团去访问联合国组织和美国政府的官员。
    规模愈来愈大的美国人民的和平运动，有力地打击着美国政府企图继续进行侵略与战争的政策。
  日本人民反对单独媾和
    由于美日反动派加紧进行单独媾和与重新武装日本的阴谋，愈来愈多的日本人民已在要求缔结全面对日和约的宣言上签名了。据日本拥护和平委员会宣布，签名要求全面媾和的人数已达二百万。日本许多工商界的人士，认识到单独媾和并不是他们的出路，如果不与新中国进行正常的贸易，日本的民族工商业就不能兴盛繁荣，因此，日本的工商界人士大部分都拥护缔结全面对日和约。
  法意人民要求和平
    法共与意共在议会选举中获得巨大胜利，打击了帝国主义及其走狗的阴谋以后，现已进一步提出保卫世界和平的主张。法共议会党团向法国国民议会提出了许多法案，要求采取措施，改善劳动人民生活，并要求缔结五大国和平公约。意共中央委员会全体会议的决议中，号召工人，农民和各阶层人民加强广泛的团结，要求政府尊重人民的意志，实行民主改革，改善人民生活，奉行和平政策。法共与意共所提出的许多主张，再一次表明了他们是唯一代表法意人民利益并为之而坚持斗争的政党。
