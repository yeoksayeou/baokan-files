(13) The heroic railway workers supporting Korea, for the glory of the motherland, put forward the slogan "Rather let the enemy bomb the water supply, than let the enemy bomb the bridge!" In two and a half days, the bridge was repaired, and more than twenty military trains waiting to cross the bridge all drove to the front.

(14) The story of Comrade Song Xiankui and others risking their lives to remove time bombs spread throughout the engineering teams. On another occasion, he also risked his life to rescue a large amount of materials from a burning ammunition train. It was the morning of March 8th when he saw a train catch fire midway after being hit by enemy planes.

(15) Enemy planes damaged the front and rear of the train. The ammunition caught fire, black smoke filled the air, and bullets flew everywhere. Song Xiankui saw that two cars in the middle of the train had not yet caught fire, so he, along with squad leader Liu Yan, and workers Li Changfu, Zhao Zhenji, and Liu Lianfa, braved the enemy's strafing and jumped into the cars.

    特等功臣宋显魁
    英韬作
    （十三）英勇的援朝铁路工人们，为了祖国的光荣，提出了“宁让敌人炸断水，不让敌人炸断桥”的口号。两天半功夫，桥修好了，等着过桥的二十多辆军用列车都开到了前方。
    （十四）宋显魁等同志冒着生命的危险移开定时炸弹的故事，在各地工程队里传开了。另一次，他还曾在燃烧的弹药列车上，奋不顾身地抢救出大批物资。那是三月八日的清晨，他看见一列车在半途被敌机打起了火。
    （十五）敌机把列车的前后部都打坏了。弹药着了火，黑烟迷漫，子弹乱飞。宋显魁看见列车中部有两节车还没起火，就和中队长刘炎、工人李昌富、赵振基、刘连发冒着敌机的扫射，跳进车去。
