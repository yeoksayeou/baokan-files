　　The Korean People's Army Advancing from Victory to Victory
　　Wu Ming
　　It is not enough to simply use the word "heroic" to describe the excellent qualities of the Korean People's Army, this just army. They possess a deep patriotism and internationalism, they have lofty ideals, they are the most outstanding sons and daughters of the hardworking, simple, brave, and energetic Korean people.

　　On the Han River front, I saw a new unit of the Korean People's Army. Half a year ago, the soldiers were still workers, farmers, and students. The atrocities of the American invading army aroused their irreconcilable hatred, and they left the factories, farms, and classrooms, took up weapons, and rushed to the front line of the battle. In the famous Suyeong Mountain battle on the south bank of the Han River, they cooperated with the Chinese People's Volunteers and fought day and night; Shen Tianjun, a worker, and his comrades repelled twenty-nine American invasion attempts. He was wounded four times and in the end, only he and his three comrades remained on the position, still holding firm on the frozen hilltop. When the enemy planes bombed in turn, they didn't move; when the artillery fired in volleys, they didn't move; when the enemy charged from all directions, each of them faced one side, throwing grenades, sweeping with submachine guns, encouraging each other to see who could pile up more enemy corpses in front of them. In this way, they finally defeated the enemy's last attack. On another occasion, when the enemy wanted to cross the Han River, the enemy's machine guns and artillery fired wildly, scorching the mountain peaks and turning the river surface red. The soldiers of this People's Army became even more heroic, one falling down, another charging forward. Under the enemy's superior firepower, they were fearless, each like a steel giant. At a critical moment, the brave Yoon Chang-hap led his comrades, passed through layers of fire nets, jumped into the icy Han River, and counterattacked the enemy. Because of his bravery and resourcefulness, catching the enemy by surprise, he inflicted great casualties on the enemy and defeated the enemy attempting to cross the river.

　　It was this heroic unit that established glorious achievements at the end of last year. After the launch of the Third Campaign – the powerful offensive to break through the "38th Parallel," they once inserted into the enemy's rear with lightning speed. In more than half a month of operations on the eastern front, they successively captured the three counties of Pyeongchang, Yeongwol, and Jeongseon. When they attacked Pyeongchang, the enemy's bunkers blocked the way at a narrow pass. The enemy fired wildly at them. The situation was very urgent. If they passed through any later, they might be surrounded. At this time, the squad leader shouted to all the comrades: "The bunkers are in front of us, comrades, if we want to move forward, we must blow them up!" Before he finished speaking, two young men carrying revolving machine guns jumped in front of the squad leader, almost saying at the same time: "Give me the large grenade!" The squad leader went up and shook their hands, tears almost bursting out: "Comrade! You still have—?" The two young heroes, their voices trembling with excitement: "Squad leader, we have nothing to say. After the war, if our family members have not been killed by the American bandits, please tell them: we responded to the call of the motherland and sacrificed ourselves to open the road to victory for the Korean people." The machine guns on both sides of the road fired fiercely at the enemy bunkers. The two of them held guns in their left hands and large grenades in their right hands, rolling forward in the fire net. In an instant, they rolled out more than fifty meters, knocking down two enemies who were counterattacking them. But as they continued to advance, one of them was hit in the abdomen and bled profusely. Could blood stop the heroes from advancing? No. Three minutes later, "Boom!" A deafening roar. This People's Army rushed up to the bunker in the sound of "Long live the Korean people!" annihilated all the enemies and opened the way forward. The two heroes heroically sacrificed themselves with the collapse of the bunker. The code name of this unit is the Second Squad of the First Detachment, and the names of the two young heroes are Kim Won-joon and Lee Ja-soo.

　　Now, after forty-nine days of bloody battles on the Han River front, this unit has been tempered into an invincible force. Like many other People's Army soldiers, just a few months ago, when they had just put down their hammers, hoes, and books, who could fire a cannon? Loading bullets into the revolving machine gun had to be done in the light, let alone tactics and military actions. But the will to defend the motherland and avenge their compatriots enabled them to learn everything. Kim Young-woon, a "Republic Hero" who shot down five enemy planes, was originally an ordinary farmer who didn't even dare to raise his head when he heard the sound of planes. After joining the army, he used the stars as targets at night and real objects as aiming points during the day, practicing hard day and night, and finally became an excellent anti-aircraft shooter, creating brilliant achievements. Wu Yong-dae, a student, used seven shells to destroy five enemy tanks across the river; and used five shells to kill a platoon of enemies who were crossing the Han River in the water. At the Suwon front, Lee Byung-woo, a hero who fought alone with the enemy for three days and nights, killed thirteen enemies, and finally picked up the enemy's grenades to fight the enemy when the bullets ran out, was just a nineteen-year-old ordinary worker from Gyeonggi Province. This iron army that has been tempered through a hundred battles has already created ten "Republic Heroes" who have repeatedly made outstanding achievements and thousands of commanders and fighters who are resourceful and brave, wearing medals.

　　Why can the Korean People's Army, which has only three years of military history, be so brave and good at fighting? General Kim Il, Deputy Director of the General Political Bureau of the People's Army, gave a good explanation. He pointed out: "The Korean People's Army, like the armies of other democratic countries, is highly politically conscious, and was personally cultivated by the great General Kim Il Sung, who has rich experience in resisting imperialist aggression. It is more accurate to say that the soldiers of the People's Army took up guns not voluntarily, but were forced to organize. After August 15th, the Korean people saw the sharp contrast between the north and south of the 38th Parallel with their own eyes; under the direct instructions of American imperialism, the Li pseudo-army had invaded us more than a thousand times before June 25th last year. How could the people not take up guns to defend their good life after liberation? Hatred is the source of strength. All the crimes of the American invading army in Korea have ignited the flames of revenge in the heart of every soldier of our People's Army, so they all fight without fear for their lives." He concluded powerfully: "We have the peace-loving people of the world behind us, and we have the determination and strength to advance from victory to victory. Although the People's Army is young, we are willing to stand at the forefront of defending human peace and wipe out all invading armies in front of us."

### 从胜利走向胜利的朝鲜人民军

　　从胜利走向胜利的朝鲜人民军
    吴明
    单单用“英勇”二字来形容朝鲜人民军这支正义军队的优良特质是不够的。他们具有深厚的爱国主义与国际主义精神，他们有崇高的理想，他们是勤劳、朴实、勇敢而且有朝气的朝鲜人民最优秀的儿女。
    在汉江前线，我看见一支朝鲜人民军的新部队。半年前，战士们还是工人、农民和学生。美国侵略军的兽行激起了他们不共戴天的仇恨，他们走出了工厂、田庄和课堂，拿起武器，奔向战斗的最前线。在汉江南岸著名的修理山战斗中，他们和中国人民志愿军互相配合，日以继夜地奋战着；工人出身的申天均和他的战友们，击退了美国侵略军二十九次进犯，他自己负伤四处，最后阵地上只剩下他和他的三个战友，仍然坚守在冰冻的山岗上。敌人飞机轮番轰炸，他们不动；大炮连珠排射，他们不动；敌人从四面八方冲上来，他们每人对付一面，打手榴弹，扫冲锋枪，互相激励着，看谁面前敌人的尸体堆的多。就这样终于打垮了敌人最后的一次进攻。又一次，当敌人要爬过汉江时，敌人的机枪大炮齐鸣，炮火打焦了山头，燃红了江面。这支人民军的战士们也更英勇了，这个倒下，那个向前冲。在敌人优势的火力下，他们毫无惧色，一个个象钢铁巨人。在一个异常紧要的时机，勇士尹昌合带着他的战友，穿过层层的火网，跳入冰冷的汉江水中，向敌人反扑过去。由于他勇猛机智，出敌不意，予敌人以极大杀伤，击溃了企图渡江的敌人。
    就是这支英勇的部队，在去年年底，树立了光辉的功勋。第三次战役——突破“三八”线的强大攻势发动以后，他们曾以神速的行动插入敌人后方，在东线半个多月的作战中，连续克复了平昌、宁越、旌善三郡。他们向平昌进击时，在一个狭隘的山口，敌人的碉堡挡住了去路，敌人疯狂地向他们射击，情况很紧迫，再晚一点通过，就可能被包围，这时，小队长向全体同志喊道：“碉堡摆在我们面前，同志们，我们要前进首先得炸毁它呀！”他的话还未说完，两个背着轮盘枪的青年跳到小队长面前，几乎是同时说出：“把大手雷拿给我！”小队长上去握住他们的手，眼泪几乎迸了出来：“同志！你还有——？”这两个青年英雄，声音激动得有些发颤：“小队长，我们没有什么话可说。战后，如果我们的家庭里的人还没有被美国强盗杀光，请告诉他们：我们响应了祖国的召唤，为朝鲜人民开辟胜利的道路而牺牲了。”公路两旁机枪猛烈地向敌人碉堡射击起来。他们二人左手持枪，右手紧握着大手雷，在火网中向前滚去。一霎时，他们滚出五十多米，打倒了向他们反击的两个敌人。但再继续前进时，其中的一个被打中了腹部，鲜血直流。鲜血能挡英雄的前进吗？不能。三分钟后，“轰”！一声震天的巨响。这支人民军在“朝鲜人民万岁！”声中冲上了碉堡，将敌人全部歼灭，打开了前进的道路。这两位英雄随着碉堡的崩裂而壮烈殉国了。这支部队的代号为一支队二小队，这两个青年英雄的名字是金元俊和李子寿。
    现在这支部队，经过汉江前线四十九天的血战，锻炼成了一支不可战胜的力量了。和其他许多人民军战士一样，数月前，他们刚刚放下铁锤、锄头和书本时，有什么人会开炮呢？往轮盘枪里压子弹还必须在光亮里，更谈不到战术和军事动作了。但是保卫祖国和复仇的意志，使他们学会了一切。击落敌机五架的“共和国英雄”金永云，原是一个平常的农民，以前听到飞机声，连头也不敢抬起来。入伍后，他晚间以星斗当目标，白天以实物作瞄准点，日以继夜地苦练着，终于成了优良的对空射手，创造了光辉的业绩。学生出身的禹龙台，以七发炮弹，隔江击坏了敌人的五辆坦克；又以五发炮弹，把偷渡汉江的一排敌人打死在水中。在水原前线，一人一枪和敌人混战三昼夜，杀死了十三个敌人，最后子弹打光拾起敌人的手榴弹打敌人的英雄李秉雨，只不过是京畿道一个十九岁的普通工人。这支百炼成钢的铁军，已经创造了十名屡建奇功的“共和国英雄”和数千名身佩勋章智勇双全的指战员。
    只有三年建军历史的朝鲜人民军为什么能这样英勇善战，人民军总政治局副局长金日将军有很好的说明。他指出：“朝鲜人民军和其他民主国家的军队一样，是具有高度政治觉悟的，在有着丰富反抗帝国主义侵略经验的伟大的金日成将军所亲手培育起来的，与其说人民军的战士是自动拿起枪来，还不如说是被迫拿起枪组织起来的更恰当些。八、一五以后，朝鲜人民亲眼看到三八线南北强烈的对比；在美帝国主义直接指示下的李伪军，去年六月二十五号前就向我们进犯过一千多次，人民要保卫自己翻身后的好生活，怎么能不拿起枪来呢？仇恨就是力量的泉源，美国侵略军在朝鲜的一切罪行，使我们每一个人民军的战士都燃起了复仇的火焰，所以打起仗来都奋不顾身。”他最后有力地说：“我们背后有全世界爱好和平的人民，我们有决心有力量从胜利走向胜利。人民军虽然年青，但我们愿意站在保卫人类和平的最前线，把一切侵略军消灭在我们的面前。”
