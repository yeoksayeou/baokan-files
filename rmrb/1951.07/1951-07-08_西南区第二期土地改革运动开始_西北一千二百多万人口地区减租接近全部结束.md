　　The second phase of the land reform movement in the Southwest region began in mid-June. This phase of land reform is being implemented in the following areas: the seven entire counties of Hechuan and Liangshan in the Eastern Sichuan region, and parts of six counties including Jiangbei and Kai County; ten entire counties including Meishan and Qiongxia in the Western Sichuan region; fourteen entire counties including Yilong and Xichong in the Northern Sichuan region; twenty-five entire counties including Lu County and Emei in the Southern Sichuan region, and the suburbs of Luzhou and Zigong cities; forty-three entire counties including Qingzhen and Guizhu in Guizhou Province, and the suburbs of Guiyang City; ten entire counties including Tianquan and Rongjing in Xikang Province; and the three entire counties of Kunming, Chenggong, and Yiliang in Yunnan Province. The rural population in the above areas totals over 30 million. Except for the twenty-five counties and two suburban areas in the Southern Sichuan region, which will be fully completed in the coming winter and spring, the remaining areas can be largely completed before the autumn harvest this year.
　　In order to better complete this phase of land reform, a large number of cadres have been trained in various places. The training method is to hold meetings to summarize the experience of the first phase of land reform and rectify ideological style. For example, Xichong County in the Northern Sichuan region trained more than 2,300 peasant cadres before and after. Now, these cadres have gone to the countryside. In addition, the local organizations of various democratic parties and people from all walks of life in various provinces (regions) and cities are also participating in this phase of land reform. In Chongqing City alone, more than 800 people from various parties and all walks of life (including some cadres from the directly affiliated organizations of the Southwest Military and Political Committee) have gone to the countryside to participate in land reform. The first and second work teams, consisting of more than 600 people from Beijing to the Southwest to participate in land reform, arrived in the rural areas of Eastern Sichuan, Southern Sichuan, Western Sichuan, and Northern Sichuan in early June.
　　In the areas where land reform is being implemented, the peasants' anti-despot and rent reduction movement was launched last winter and this spring. Through this movement, the feudal forces were weakened, and the strength of the peasants was developed. Moreover, the peasants' awareness has been improved, and they are eager to implement land reform. This time, after the local people's governments posted notices about the implementation of land reform, the peasants said, "The day of land distribution is coming!" They guaranteed that they would complete the patriotic production increase task while carrying out land reform this summer.

　　A vast rural area in the Northwest region implemented rent reduction last winter and this spring. The areas where rent reduction was implemented include: more than 1,980 townships in 30 counties (cities) under the Hanzhong, Ankang, and Shangluo special districts in southern Shaanxi Province, more than 2,600 townships in 53 counties in Gansu Province, 129 townships in 5 counties in Ningxia Province, and 253 townships in 12 counties in Qinghai Province; a total of 100 counties (cities), more than 4,900 townships. The population totals more than 12 million, accounting for more than 45% of the total population of the Northwest region. As of now, except for more than 100 townships in Gansu Province where the rent reduction movement has not yet ended, the rent reduction work in other areas has been completed.
　　Like other parts of the country, the landlords in the Northwest region heavily exploited the peasants through land rent. Except for a few areas, the amount of land rent generally accounted for about 50% of the total land income, with the highest reaching more than 80%. Although the "regular rent" in Qinghai Province was relatively light, various additional forms of exploitation accounted for 20-30% of the total land income. The peasants described the exploitation they suffered as "cutting a radish into several pieces." In Linxia Special District of Gansu Province, there was also a prevailing serf system of "recruiting retainers," where the recruited retainers (peasants) had to serve the landlords for generations. Through this rent reduction, the exploitation suffered by the peasants in the Northwest region has been greatly reduced.
　　Through this rent reduction movement, the strength of the peasants in various parts of the Northwest region has greatly developed. The number of peasant association members in southern Shaanxi Province and Gansu Province generally accounts for more than 25% of the total rural population, with the highest reaching more than 30%. The political consciousness of the peasants has also generally improved. In this rent reduction, the Hui peasants and Han peasants in Gansu and Qinghai unanimously struggled against the landlord class, further strengthening national unity.
　　All localities paid attention to the work of training cadres in the rent reduction movement. For example, in more than 2,000 townships in Gansu Province, more than 21,000 outstanding peasant activists were selected to work in the rural government. The cadres in various places have also improved their ideological methods and work styles after the exercise of this rent reduction work. These laid a favorable foundation for the implementation of land reform in the above-mentioned areas this winter and next spring.

### 西南区第二期土地改革运动开始  西北一千二百多万人口地区减租接近全部结束

　　西南区第二期土地改革运动开始
    西北一千二百多万人口地区减租接近全部结束
    西南区第二期土地改革运动已在六月中旬开始。这一期实行土地改革的地区，包括川东区合川、梁山等七个整县，和江北、开县等六县的各一部分；川西区眉山、邛峡等十个整县；川北区仪陇、西充等十四个整县；川南区泸县、峨眉等二十五个整县，和泸州市、自贡市两市郊区；贵州省清镇、贵筑等四十三个整县，和贵阳市的郊区；西康省天全、荣经等十个整县；云南省昆明、呈贡、宜良三个整县。以上地区农村人口共计三千多万。其中除川南区二十五县和两个市郊区须今冬明春才能全部完成以外，其余地区在今年秋收以前可大体完成。
    为更好地完成这一期土地改革，各地都曾训练了大批的干部。训练方法是开会总结第一期土地改革工作经验和整顿思想作风。如川北区西充县前后就训练了两千三百多个农民干部。现在，这些干部都已经下乡了。此外，参加这一期土地改革工作的，还有各省（区）、市的各民主党派地方组织、各界人士。仅重庆市这次下乡参加土地改革工作的各党派、各界人士（包括一部分西南军政委员会直属机关的干部），就有八百多人。从北京前来西南参加土地改革的第一、第二两个工作团六百多人，六月初已经分别到了川东、川南、川西和川北的各地农村。
    上述实行土地改革的地区，在去冬今春都曾发动农民反恶霸和减租运动，经过这个运动，削弱了封建势力，发展了农民的力量。而且农民的觉悟都提高了，他们对于实行土地改革迫不及待。这次，各地人民政府贴出实行土地改革的布告后，农民都说：“分田的日子可来到了。”他们保证：今年夏天一面进行土地改革，一面还要完成爱国增产任务。

    西北区有广大的农村在去冬今春实行了减租。减租的地区包括：陕西省南部汉中、安康和商雒三专区所属三十个县（市）的一千九百八十多个乡，甘肃省五十三个县的二千六百多个乡，宁夏省五个县的一百二十九个乡，和青海省十二个县的二百五十三个乡；以上共一百个县（市），四千九百多个乡。人口共为一千二百多万，占西北全区总人口的百分之四十五强。截至目前为止，上述实行减租的地区，除甘肃省有一百多个乡的减租运动还没有结束以外，其余各地减租工作都已经完成了。
    和全国其他各地一样，西北区地主对农民的地租剥削是很重的。除少数地区外，地租额一般占土地总收入的百分之五十左右，最高达百分之八十以上。青海省“正租”虽较轻，但各项额外剥削达土地总收入的百分之二、三十。农民们把自己所受的剥削，形容为“一个萝卜几头切”。甘肃省临夏专区还流行着一种“招门客”的农奴制度，被招的门客（农民），世世代代要给地主服劳役。经过这次减租，西北农民所受的剥削已大大减轻。
    经过这次减租运动，西北各地农民的力量有很大的发展，陕西省南部和甘肃省等地农民协会会员数，一般都占农村总人口的百分之二十五以上，最高达百分之三十多。农民的政治觉悟也普遍提高了一步。在这次减租中，甘肃和青海的回族农民和汉族农民，一致对地主阶级进行了斗争，进一步加强了民族的团结。
    各地在减租运动中，都注意了培养干部的工作。如甘肃省二千多个乡中，即有二万一千多名农民优秀分子被选拔到乡村政权中工作。各地干部经过这次减租工作的锻炼，在思想方法和工作作风等方面也都有提高。这些，就为今冬明春在上述地区实行土地改革奠定了有利的基础。
