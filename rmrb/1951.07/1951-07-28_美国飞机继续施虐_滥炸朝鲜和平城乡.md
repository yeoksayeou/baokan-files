　　美国飞机继续施虐
　  滥炸朝鲜和平城乡
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社平壤讯：美机多架于二十六日晨再度滥炸平壤。美机从密云中投下了一百多枚炸弹，其中有许多是定时炸弹。在此以前，美机曾于二十四日晨滥炸平壤市区和近郊的农田、道路。据平壤市人民委员会报告，从七月十日至十五日，就有美机一百二十多架对平壤进行了四十五次空袭。
    从大城市到农民的茅舍都受到了美机的野蛮袭击。据朝鲜中央通讯社报道：在平安南道，过去二十天中，约有八百所农舍被毁。
    在南浦，美机从七月十七日至十九日，共投下炸弹一百七十多枚。
    在平安南道平原县，美国喷气机多架轰炸并扫射了该县三群（译音）区的农民家园。美机的野蛮行动同时得到在海上的美国军舰的支持。美舰发射的炮弹摧毁了许多农民的家园。若干在田里劳动的农民被残忍的美国强盗杀死或打伤了。
    尽管目前在开城举行停战谈判，但是，美国强盗却继续进行着他们的罪恶屠杀和破坏。朝鲜人民对此表示莫大的愤怒。
