　　Youth Palace Cinema Manager and China Youth Art Theater
    Self-Criticism Regarding the Waste of Land During Cinema Construction
  (I)
        To the Comrades of the People's Daily Editorial Board:
    On June 20th, the People's Daily published a criticism from the Youth Palace Branch of the Beijing Film Industry Trade Union regarding the Youth Palace Cinema Manager Zhuang Kunpeng's condoning of the contractor's cutting corners during the construction project. At the time, we were in the process of handling this issue, and after it was published, we conducted a further investigation and study. We are now informing you of the results of the handling and the self-criticism of the China Youth Art Theater (the leading body of the Youth Palace Cinema) regarding administrative aspects.
    Before and during the land repair, Youth Palace Manager Zhuang Kunpeng did eat in restaurants with Yang Guanqun, Huang Youlin, and others, and accepted gifts. During construction, due to the lack of supervision and material inspection, the contractor was able to cut corners, resulting in a loss of 5 to 8 million yuan for the entire repair project. After the error was discovered, Zhuang Kunpeng was able to admit his mistakes promptly, actively requested punishment, and wrote several written self-criticisms. We have decided to give him a demerit.
    The China Youth Art Theater also exhibited the following shortcomings in handling the land repair issue:
    (1) We over-trusted Zhuang Kunpeng and did not check the contractor's construction situation early enough. This is a manifestation of our work not being thorough enough.
    (2) When the project went bad, we only deducted 4 million yuan from the project payment and organized a temporary land repair committee to be responsible for repairing the land. We only made mild criticisms of Zhuang Kunpeng eating with the contractor and other issues, and did not immediately conduct research with the workers to further discover other errors. The inspection of waste was also postponed until after the land was repaired. This shows that we did not pay enough attention to the workers' opinions and did not handle the issue quickly and seriously.
    (3) After the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions' Fifth District Office sent a letter stating that Zhuang Kunpeng may have engaged in corruption after contractor Huang Youlin was detained by the public security organs for theft, we paid more attention to this issue. At that time, we immediately sent special personnel to conduct investigations and gradually handle it. In early May, we submitted preliminary handling opinions to higher authorities for approval. In late May, we received the investigation materials from the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate and, based on these existing materials, decided on the punishment for Zhuang and the handling method for the land repair issue. However, during the handling process, we did not solicit the opinions of the worker comrades or explain how the leadership was handling the matter, which made the worker comrades feel that they only saw the investigation but no results. This shows that we lacked a mass perspective.
    The last paragraph of the original criticism stated that the workers "had reflected their opinions to the leadership of the Youth Palace several times, but they always thought that the workers were deliberately making trouble and ignored them;" and so on. This statement does not correspond to the actual situation. In fact, no one in the leadership of the Youth Palace said that the workers' opinions were deliberately making trouble. In addition, we did not think that the workers' opinions were a conflict between the trade union and the administration. We said that there was prejudice between individual trade union cadres and Zhuang Kunpeng, which is a fact; but we did not link this fact with the trade union's criticism of Zhuang Kunpeng, and therefore underestimated the handling of this criticism.
    The written self-criticism of Zhuang Kunpeng is attached, please publish it together.

  (II)
  Zhuang Kunpeng's Self-Criticism
    In the project of repairing the land in front of the Youth Palace and the flower beds, the main errors I committed are as follows:
    (1) I did not stand firm and displayed a bureaucratic work style. When contracting, I did not look for a reliable construction company but listened to private introductions; I had no experience with the provisions of the contract on labor and materials, but I did not humbly consult others more. I was not familiar with the fact that the climate would affect the firmness of the cement's solidification and that the new cement surface should be allowed to sit for ten days before people could walk on it. After the start of construction, I did not insist on supervising the work and inspecting the materials, thus giving the contractor the opportunity to commit fraud. The main reason for these errors is that I lacked a strong sense of responsibility.
    (2) I harbored the idea of ​​seeking petty gains. Before the land repair, I ate with the contractor Huang Youlin and others several times. At that time, I thought they had money anyway and did not ask about the source of the money. After the contract was signed, Huang Youlin invited me to dinner again and sent dumplings. Because there was such involvement with each other, I could no longer strictly fight against the shortcomings in the project. After hearing the comrades' opinions, I still did not supervise the work and inspect the materials, but instead helped Huang Youlin raise cash, standing on the side of the contractor. This shows that extreme individualism has developed to a rather serious degree.
    (3) I lacked a mass perspective and did not value the opinions of the masses. When the workers questioned the cement's lack of adhesion, I did not pay attention to it. The reason is that I harbored the idea of ​​looking down on the workers. My attitude in daily conversations always showed that I was superior, and I could not humbly learn from the masses. I knew I was wrong, but I was unwilling to admit it, fearing that it would be embarrassing. As a result, it affected the unity between cadres and made the work not go well.
    Because I brought many non-proletarian ideas from the old society, lacked understanding of the revolution, and did not actively study, I still cannot stand firm. I sincerely accept the punishment given to me by the organization and the criticisms from the comrades this time, and I am willing to intensify my study in the future to improve my class consciousness.

### 青年宫电影院经理及中国青年艺术剧院  关于电影院修建场地发生浪费问题的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　青年宫电影院经理及中国青年艺术剧院
    关于电影院修建场地发生浪费问题的检讨  
  （一）
        中国青年艺术剧院的信编辑同志：
    六月二十日人民日报发表了北京市电影业工会青年宫支会对青年宫电影院经理庄昆鹏在修建工程中纵容包商偷工减料的批评，当时，我们正在处理这一问题，见报后又作了更进一步的检查和研究。现将处理结果和青年艺术剧院（青年宫电影院的领导机关）行政方面的检讨告诉你们。
    修地前及修地期内，青年宫经理庄昆鹏确曾和杨冠群，黄友林等人在饭馆吃饭，并接受礼物，在施工中因为没有监工和验收材料，以致使包商得以偷工减料，全部修理工程损失五百至八百万元。错误发现后，庄昆鹏尚能及时承认错误，主动请求处分，并写过数次书面检讨。我们决定给予记大过一次的处分。
    青年艺术剧院对处理修地问题上也表现了以下缺点：
    （一）过分信任庄昆鹏，没有及早检查包工施工情况，这是我们工作不深入的表现。
    （二）工程坏了，仅限于扣下工程款四百万元及组织了临时修地委员会负责把地重新修好。对庄昆鹏和承包商在一起吃饭等问题，只作了轻淡的批评，而且没有立即和工人一道进行研究，以便进一步发现其他错误。对浪费的检查，也推延到将地修好以后进行。这说明我们对工人意见重视不够，没有迅速认真处理问题。
    （三）承包商黄友林因偷窃行为被公安机关扣押，北京市总工会五区办事处来信谈及庄昆鹏可能有贪污行为后，我们才比较重视了这问题，当时即派专人进行调查研究和逐步处理。五月上旬提出初步处理意见交上级机关批示，五月下旬接到北京市人民检察署的调查材料，即根据这些已有的材料，决定了对庄的处分及修地问题的处理办法。但是在处理过程中，没有征求工人同志的意见并讲明领导上在如何进行处理等等，所以使得工人同志们感到只见调查不见结果，这说明我们缺乏群众观点。
    原批评信的最末一段说到：工人们“曾经几次把自己的意见反映给青年宫的领导机关，但是他们总认为是工人故意捣乱，置之不理；”等等。这个说法是不符合实际的。事实上青年宫的领导机关并没有人说工人提意见是故意捣乱。此外，我们对工人提出意见，也没有认为这是工会和行政闹对立，我们说个别工会干部与庄昆鹏之间有成见，这一点是事实；但是我们并没有把这个事实与工会对庄昆鹏的批评牵连在一起，因而轻视对这个批评的处理。
    另附上庄昆鹏的书面检讨，请一并发表。

  （二）
  庄昆鹏的检讨
    在修整青年宫门前场地及花池这一工程中，我所犯的错误，主要有以下几点：
    （１）没有站稳立场，表现出官僚主义作风。包工时不去找可靠营造厂而听信私人介绍；合同上工料部分的规定，自己既无经验，但也没有虚心多请教别人。气候会影响洋灰凝结的坚固程度，新洋灰面应待十天后方能走人，这些事情，我事先均不熟悉。开工后更未坚持监工验料，因此给包工者舞弊机会。这些错误的发生，主要的是因为我责任心不强。
    （２）自己存有贪小利的思想。修地前我与包商黄友林等吃了几次饭，那时认为反正他们有钱，亦不问钱的来源。订合同后黄友林又约吃饭及送来饺子等。因为彼此有了这种牵连，我就不能再和工程中存在的缺点作严格的斗争。听到同志们的意见后，仍不去监工验料，反帮助黄友林筹措现款，站在包工一边。这说明了极端个人主义思想发展到相当严重的程度。
    （３）缺乏群众观点，不重视群众意见。工人对洋灰黏不牢提出疑问时，我未加注意。原因是我存有看不起工人的思想，平日谈话态度总表示高人一等，不能虚心向群众学习。自己明知错了，还不肯承认，怕面子不好看。结果就影响到干部间的团结，使工作搞不好。
    由于我从旧社会带来了许多非无产阶级的思想，对革命缺乏认识，又没有积极学习，因此还不能站稳立场。我诚恳地接受这次组织上给我的处分和同志们的批评，并愿在今后加紧学习，提高自己的阶级觉悟。
