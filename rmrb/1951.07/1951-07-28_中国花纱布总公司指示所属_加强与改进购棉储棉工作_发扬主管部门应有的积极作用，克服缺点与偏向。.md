The China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation issued instructions on July 25th to its affiliated branches and sub-branches, requesting them to promote the advantages of past work, correct shortcomings and errors, and strive for greater achievements in cotton purchasing and storage. The instructions stated: In the cotton purchasing and storage work, companies at all levels in various regions, under the leadership of the local CCP committees and people's governments, have done a lot of work and made certain achievements in completing this task. However, because many units and some working cadres have the idea of relying on Party and government organs, believing that the current cotton purchasing and storage campaign is mainly the responsibility of Party and government organs, they have adopted a passive attitude, so that they have not played the active role that the competent department should have played in the campaign. Recently, based on the spirit of the July 21st People's Daily editorial "Strive for Greater Achievements in Cotton Purchasing and Storage" and the reports of work groups in various regions, the head office has made a preliminary study of the advantages and disadvantages of companies at all levels in this campaign in the past, and put forward the following opinions on future work:

(1) In the past month or so, companies at all levels have done a lot of work, much of which has been done very well. For example, companies in Hebei, Henan, Pingyuan, Zhejiang, Shanghai, Hubei, Shanxi, Shandong, and Northern Jiangsu, combined with cadres from other local institutions, have organized many mobile cotton purchasing teams to go deep into the countryside. Shijiazhuang, Nangong and other companies in Hebei Province have universally set up cotton collection stations and reception sheds to facilitate the masses in selling cotton; and used methods such as comic strips and a letter campaign to carry out propaganda combining politics and business, which have played a significant role. Comrade Zhang Tuo, the leader of the Sucun purchasing team in Lingbao County, Henan Province, carried out cotton sales propaganda while helping farmers rush to plant in the rain; the second mobile team in Fancheng, Hubei Province, mobilized the masses to sell cotton while helping farmers thresh wheat, teaching literacy, and teaching singing, which had a good impact on the masses. Many lower-level companies have adapted to the needs of the masses and opened the scales early and late to collect cotton. The Qidong Cotton Collection Station in Northern Jiangsu opened the scales as early as 4:30 every morning and closed the scales very late. In terms of transportation, companies at all levels have been more tense than before. Shangqiu and other companies in Henan Province have also established transportation teams to specifically supervise the centralized transportation of cotton, so that the cotton does not stay in the primary market and is accelerated to industrial cities. Some Party and government leaders in Nantong, Qidong and other places in Northern Jiangsu lacked confidence in cotton purchasing, and the company cadres took the initiative to provide typical investigation materials for research, so that the leaders strengthened their confidence and re-deployed the work. The above practices have been of great help to the development of the cotton purchasing and storage campaign.

(2) The main problem in the work of companies at all levels in this campaign is reliance on Party and government organs and insufficient initiative. Some companies still work in the old way and have not strengthened and improved cotton purchasing and transportation work through the campaign. They lack investigation and research on the progress of the campaign, so they cannot provide information and suggestions to the local Party and government organs and higher-level leading organs in a timely manner. Many leading cadres of companies at all levels believe that the company's task is only to "receive and transport"; propaganda mobilization and organizational leadership are not the company's responsibility. The Hubei Provincial Company handed over the cotton purchasing work to lower-level companies, but closed the door to engage in "cadre review" learning, abandoning or relaxing leadership. The deputy manager of the Shandong Provincial Company went to Dezhou District to inspect the work, but hurriedly returned after only three days, without solving any problems or understanding the situation very well. The manager of the Wuan branch company in Hebei Province did not participate in the cotton purchasing work group report and adopted an indifferent attitude towards the campaign. In the county's cotton purchasing and storage office, the company only sent one trainee to participate. After the Pingyuan Provincial Company handed over most of the tasks to the cooperative, the cooperative was understaffed and too busy; but some cadres of the company believed that since they "had already paid the handling fee, they could no longer compensate the cooperative with cadres." Some cooperatives in Shandong, Northern Jiangsu and other places did not dare to purchase on behalf of the company due to the lack of grading technicians; and the company's technical assistance was also very insufficient. This phenomenon of not starting from the overall situation is wrong. In the purchasing work, some companies mistakenly adopted methods such as raising prices or disguised price increases and giving bonuses, which caused the phenomenon of cotton flow, and cotton farmers were more optimistic about price increases and reluctant to sell, which affected the development of the campaign. Some companies failed to change their working methods according to the requirements of cotton farmers, and even adopted a bureaucratic attitude, emphasizing going to and from work on time, which aroused farmers' dissatisfaction. The Shangmaoyijian Cotton Purchasing Station in Anyang County, Pingyuan Province, lacked preparation before purchasing cotton, and the masses lacked money and grain coupons when they wanted them during cotton purchasing, which aroused the masses' suspicion. All of the above shows that in order to strive for greater achievements in cotton purchasing and storage, it is indeed necessary for us to change our thinking, change our style, and improve our work.

(3) In order to continue to deeply develop the cotton purchasing and storage campaign, all cadres of the company must conscientiously study the People's Daily editorial and other relevant documents. It should be recognized that mobilizing cotton farmers to sell and store cotton will be a relatively long-term political task in the future. The personnel of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company should give full play to the due role of the competent department under the leadership of the local Party and government organs, make redoubled efforts, change their style, and improve work efficiency. To this end, we must:

    1. Strengthen the work of understanding the situation, summarize and study the progress of the cotton purchasing and storage campaign in a timely manner, put forward suggestions for improving our own work and promoting the entire campaign, and submit them to the local Party and government organs and higher-level leading departments.

    2. We must do a good job of relations with cooperatives and brother companies. Proceed from the overall interests, help each other, and overcome the "small abacus" viewpoints existing on both sides. Strengthen the understanding of the needs of the masses, overcome all difficulties, and prepare for the supply of materials at present and after autumn.

    3. Resolutely implement the listed price stipulated by the Central Committee. According to the decision of the Central Price Conference, all levels have no maneuverability on cotton prices. If the market price is higher than the listed price, we must suggest and assist the local leading organs to strengthen market management, and not allow the use of methods such as raising prices, upgrading grades, and other disguised price increases.

    4. Organize all forces to carry out cotton purchasing and storage work in a way that facilitates the masses. In addition to combining the forces of cooperatives and brother companies, Hebei also organized private merchants to purchase on their behalf, or temporarily hired cotton merchants to purchase for us. Zhechuan, Henan combined with the summer conscription cadres, carried samples of graded cotton, went deep into the countryside, and purchased from household to household. The company sent people to conduct roving guidance on technology. These methods can be used for reference in various places. And hope that companies at all levels will create more and better new methods.

    5. The processing, packaging and transportation of raw cotton that has been mastered has now become a very important task. Cotton mills in various places have resumed work one after another, and 50% of the cotton stored in our company system is still scattered in small and medium-sized towns and rural areas. This phenomenon is not allowed. The current cotton storage volume of all branches and sub-branches shall not exceed half a month's purchase volume, and the received cotton must be processed, packaged and shipped out within half a month. District and provincial companies should organize special groups to be responsible for inspection, and organize all forces through the local Party and government leading organs to overcome all difficulties and make it happen.

### 中国花纱布总公司指示所属  加强与改进购棉储棉工作  发扬主管部门应有的积极作用，克服缺点与偏向。

　　中国花纱布总公司指示所属
　  加强与改进购棉储棉工作
　  发扬主管部门应有的积极作用，克服缺点与偏向。
    中国花纱布公司于七月二十五日向所属各级分、支公司发出指示，要求发扬过去工作中的优点，纠正缺点错误，为购棉储棉工作的更大成绩而斗争。指示中说：在购棉储棉工作中，各地各级公司曾在当地中共党委和人民政府领导下，为完成此项任务作了许多工作，做出了一定成绩。但由于不少单位及部分工作干部有依赖党政机关的思想，认为此次购棉储棉运动主要由党政机关负责，自己便采取了被动态度，以致在运动中没有起主管部门应有的积极作用。最近总公司根据七月二十一日人民日报社论《为购棉储棉的更大成绩而斗争》的精神，及各地工作组汇报的情况，对过去各级公司在这一运动中的优缺点作了初步研究，并对今后工作提出下列意见：
    （一）一个多月来各级公司做了很多工作，其中有许多做得很好。如河北、河南、平原、浙江、上海、湖北、山西、山东、苏北等地公司，结合当地其他机构的干部，组织了很多流动购棉小组，深入农村。河北石家庄、南宫等公司普设收花站、招待棚，以便利群众售棉；并采用连环画、一封信运动等方式进行了政治与业务结合的宣传，都起了不少作用。河南灵宝县苏村收购组组长张坨同志，在雨后帮助农民抢种中进行售棉宣传；湖北樊城第二流动组在帮助农民打麦、教识字、教唱歌中动员群众售棉，都给群众以良好影响。许多下级公司适应群众要求，早晚均开秤收花。苏北启东收花处每晨四时半就开秤，很晚才收秤。在调运工作上，各级公司也比以前更紧张了。河南商邱等公司还成立了运输组，专门督导棉花集中调运工作，使棉花在初级市场没有停留，加速运向工业城市。苏北的南通、启东等地某些党政领导同志对购棉缺乏信心，公司干部即主动把典型调查材料提供研究，使领导同志加强了信心，重新布置了工作。以上这些做法，对购、储棉运动的开展都有很大帮助。
    （二）在此次运动中，各级公司工作中存在的主要毛病，是依赖党政机关，本身的主动精神不足。部分公司依然照老样子工作，没有通过运动来加强和改进购棉运棉工作。对于运动的进展情况缺乏调查研究，因此不能及时向当地党政机关和上级领导机关提供资料和建议。各级公司领导干部中，有不少认为公司的任务仅仅是“收进来运出去”；宣传动员和组织领导则不是公司的责任。湖北省公司把购棉工作交给下级公司去做，自己却关起门来搞“审干”学习，放弃或放松了领导。山东省公司副经理到德州区检查工作，仅仅三天就匆匆回去，什么问题也没有解决，连情况也了解得很少。河北武安支公司经理不参加购棉工作组汇报，对运动采取漠不关心态度。该县购储棉办公室中，公司仅派一练习生去参加。平原省公司把大部分任务交给合作社以后，合作社力量不足，忙不过来；而公司有的干部却认为自己“既出了手续费，就不能再给合作社赔干部进去”。山东、苏北等地有些合作社因分级技术人员少，不敢代公司收购；公司方面在技术上协助也很不够。这种不从整体出发的现象是错误的。在收购工作中，有些公司错误地采用了提价或变相加价、给奖金等办法，曾造成棉花乱流的现象，棉农更加看涨惜售，影响了运动的开展。有些公司未能根据棉农要求，改变工作方式，甚至采取官僚主义态度，强调按时上下班，引起农民不满。平原省安阳县上毛义涧购棉站，购棉之前缺乏准备，购棉中群众要款没款，要粮票没粮票，引起群众怀疑。以上种种，都说明我们为争取购棉储棉更大成绩，确有改变思想、改变作风与改进工作的必要。
    （三）为继续深入开展购棉储棉运动，公司全体干部必须认真学习人民日报社论及其他有关文件。应认清今后动员棉农售棉储棉将是比较长期的政治任务，花纱布公司人员要在各地党政机关领导下发挥主管部门应有的作用，加倍努力，改变作风，提高工作效率。为此，我们必须：
    １、加强了解情况的工作，及时把购储棉运动进展情况汇总研究，提出改进本身工作及推进整个运动的建议，提交当地党政机关及上级领导部门。
    ２、必须搞好和合作社、兄弟公司的关系。从整体利益出发，互相协助，克服双方存在的“小算盘”观点。加强对群众需要的了解，克服一切困难，准备目前与秋后的物资供应。
    ３、坚决执行中央规定的牌价。根据中央物价会议决定，棉花牌价各级均无机动权。如市价高于牌价的情况发生，我们要建议并协助当地领导机关加强市场管理，不允许再用提高价格、提升等级与其他变相提价的方法。
    ４、组织一切力量，以便利群众的方式进行购棉储棉工作。河北除结合合作社、各兄弟公司一切力量外，并曾组织私商代购，或临时雇棉商为我收购。河南浙川结合夏征干部、携带分级棉样，深入农村，按户收购，在技术上由公司派人巡回指导，这些方法，都可供各地参考。并希各级公司创造更多更好的新方法。
    ５、已掌握的原棉的加工打包和调运，目前已成为十分重要的工作。各地纱厂已先后复工，而我公司系统存棉还有百分之五十散在中小城镇与农村，这一现象是不允许的。一切分、支公司目前存棉量不得超过半个月的收购量，一定要在半月内把收到的棉花加工打包运出。区、省级公司要组织专门小组负责检查，并通过当地党政领导机关组织一切力量，克服一切困难，使之实现。
