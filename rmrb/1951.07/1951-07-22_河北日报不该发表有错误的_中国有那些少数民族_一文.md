    To the Editors:
    On June 17th, the People's Daily's "Book and Newspaper Review" criticized the "Chahar Education" publication for publishing the article "What Ethnic Minorities Are There in China?", which insulted ethnic minorities. Shortly thereafter, the "Chahar Education" publication and the Cultural and Educational Department of the Chahar Provincial People's Government made a public self-criticism in the People's Daily on July 8th. However, the Hebei Daily published this erroneous article again in its "Cultural Palace" column on July 8th. This shows that the editors of the newspaper adopted a careless and casual attitude when selecting manuscripts for publication. This kind of mistake is intolerable. I hope the Hebei Daily will make a public self-criticism.

### 河北日报不该发表有错误的“中国有那些少数民族”一文

    河北日报不该发表有错误的“中国有那些少数民族”一文编者同志：
    六月十七日人民日报的《书报评论》，曾对刊载侮辱少数民族的“中国有那些少数民族”一文的《察哈尔教育》进行了的批评。此后不久，《察哈尔教育》社与察哈尔省人民政府文教厅，在七月八日的人民日报上作了公开检讨。但河北日报于七月八日的《文化宫》栏内，又发表了这篇有错误的文章。这说明该报编辑人员在选发稿件时，采取了马虎、随便的态度。这种错误是不能容忍的。希望河北日报公开检讨。
