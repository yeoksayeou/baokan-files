　　The Soviet Union Widely Introduces the Chinese People's Liberation Army
　　Writers Such as Simonov Write Books Narrating the Great Role of Our People's Liberation Army in the Chinese Revolution
    【Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 26th】 The Soviet Union widely introduces the combat history of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The famous Soviet writer Simonov wrote a long impressionistic account of the People's Liberation Army, "Fighting China," in which he said: "The Chinese People's Liberation Army, led by the Communist Party, played a great and decisive role in the history of the Chinese revolution. Writing the history of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is writing a history of the Chinese revolution." Many Soviet books introducing the Chinese revolution have used extensive sections to introduce the People's Liberation Army. For example, the famous Soviet historian George Elenberg, in his "Collection of Essays on the National Liberation Struggle of the Modern Chinese People," describes in detail the Nanchang Uprising of 1927, the meeting of Chairman Mao and Zhu De in Jinggangshan, the establishment of the Fourth Army of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, the establishment of revolutionary base areas, the Chinese Red Army's several counter-encirclement campaigns, the great 25,000-li Long March, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the combat history of the Chinese People's Liberation Army during the Third Revolutionary Civil War period. These descriptions are also accompanied by many valuable photographs and diagrams. Yurev, in his book "The Historically Significant Victory of the Chinese People Against American Imperialism and the Kuomintang Reactionaries," analyzed the factors contributing to the victory of the Chinese revolution, writing: "One of the greatest advantages of the Chinese revolution is that the Communist Party established and nurtured a powerful People's Liberation Army. In the more than twenty years since the 1925-1927 revolution, the Chinese Communist Party has been able to build a strong army of millions of Chinese people from small revolutionary ranks. This army defeated the army of the Kuomintang reactionaries supported by American imperialism."
    The Soviet people saw the combat actions of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the documentary "The Victory of the Chinese People" screened last year, and also saw the image of the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the famous Chinese film "Steel Soldier" recently screened. The Soviet audience unanimously expressed their love for these films, especially the many scenes depicting the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The Pravda published a film review on "Steel Soldier" on July 2nd, saying: "This film truthfully and with great moving power narrates the heroic spirit of the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and narrates their indomitable determination to defeat the reactionary forces."

　　苏联广泛介绍中国人民解放军
　  西蒙诺夫等作家著书叙述我解放军在中国革命中的伟大作用
    【新华社莫斯科二十六日电】苏联广泛介绍中国人民解放军的战斗史迹。苏联著名作家西蒙诺夫写了一本介绍人民解放军的长篇印象记《战斗着的中国》，他说：“共产党领导的中国人民解放军，在中国革命史上起了伟大的决定性的作用。写中国人民解放军史就是写一部中国革命史。”苏联许多介绍中国革命的书籍，都用大量篇幅介绍了人民解放军。例如，苏联著名历史学家乔治·爱伦堡在《近代中国人民民族解放斗争论文集》一书中，就详尽地叙述了一九二七年的南昌起义，毛主席和朱德在井岗山的会师，中国工农红军第四军的成立，革命根据地的建立，中国红军几次反围剿的斗争，伟大的二万五千里长征，抗日战争，和第三次国内革命战争时期中国人民解放军的战斗历史。这些叙述还附有许多宝贵的照片和图解。尤列夫在《中国人民反对美帝国主义和国民党反动派的历史意义的胜利》一书中，分析了中国革命胜利的因素，他写道：“中国革命一个最大的优越性，就是共产党建立和培养了强大的人民解放军。在一九二五—一九二七年革命以来的二十多年中，中国共产党能够从小小的革命队伍中建立了强大的几百万中国人民的军队。这个军队击破了美帝国主义所支持的国民党反动派的军队。”
    苏联人民在去年放映的文献纪录片《中国人民的胜利》中看到了中国人民解放军的战斗行动，又在最近放映的中国名片《钢铁战士》中看到了中国人民解放军指战员的形象。苏联的观众们异口同声地表示喜爱这些片子，特别是描写中国人民解放军的许多镜头。真理报七月二日发表介绍《钢铁战士》的影评说：“这个片子真实而带着巨大的动人的力量叙述了中国人民解放军官兵的英雄精神，叙述了他们要战胜反动势力的不屈不挠的决心。”
