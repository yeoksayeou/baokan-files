Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 19th: Both the London *Daily Worker* and the Paris *l'Humanité* published editorials on the 13th, commenting on the U.S. draft treaty with Japan. The *Daily Worker* said: The recently published U.S.-made draft treaty with Japan is one of the most shameless abandonments of principle in history, and its essence is to rearm Japan and encourage Japan to prepare for war. The *Daily Worker* said: "All the British people must rise up against this treaty which does not lead to peace but to devastating war."
    The *l'Humanité* editorial said: It is now formally shown that the United States advocates unrestricted rearmament of Japan, complete freedom from reparations obligations, and immediate participation of Japan in the U.S. endeavor to conquer Asia, participating in a Pacific pact openly aimed at anti-Sovietism. It is also known that China, which suffered the most from Japanese aggression and sacrificed millions of people in the War of Resistance Against Japan, has been excluded from participating in the peace treaty with Japan.

　　斥美制对日和约导向战争
　　并反对排除中国正当权利
    【新华社布格拉十九日电】伦敦《工人日报》和巴黎《人道报》均于十三日发表社论，评论美国对日和约草案。工人日报说：最近发表的美制对日和约草案，是历史上最无耻的一件放弃原则的事，它的本质是要重新武装日本和鼓励日本准备战争。《工人日报》说：“全体英国人民都必须奋起反对这种不是导向和平而是导向毁灭性的战争的和约。”
    《人道报》社论说：现在已经正式地表明：美国主张使日本进行无限制的重新武装，完全摆脱赔偿的义务，并且使日本立即参加美国征服亚洲的事业，参加公开以反苏为目标的太平洋公约。人们又已经知道：最先遭受日本侵略而且在抗日战争中牺牲成百万人民的中国，竟然被排除参加对日媾和。
