Why Can China's Red Political Power Exist? (October 5, 1928)
    Mao Zedong
    This is a part of the resolution written by Comrade Mao Zedong for the Second Congress of the Xianggan Border Region Party, originally titled: "Political Issues and the Tasks of the Border Region Party."
        Mao Zedong Selected Works Publishing Committee
  I. The Domestic Political Situation
    The rule of the new warlords of the Kuomintang is still the rule of the comprador class in the cities and the landlord gentry class in the countryside. They surrender to imperialism externally, and internally replace the old warlords with new warlords. Their economic exploitation and political oppression of the working class and peasantry are even more severe than before. The bourgeois democratic revolution that started from Guangdong was usurped by the comprador and landlord gentry class halfway, and immediately turned to the road of counter-revolution. The workers, peasants, and ordinary people, and even the bourgeoisie [1], are still under counter-revolutionary rule, without gaining the slightest political or economic liberation.
    The Kuomintang's new warlords, the Jiang, Gui, Feng, and Yan factions [2], had a temporary unity against Zhang Zuolin [3] before Beijing and Tianjin were captured. After Beijing and Tianjin were captured, this unity immediately dissolved, turning into a situation of fierce internal struggles among the four factions, with the Jiang and Gui factions even brewing war. The contradictions and struggles among the various warlord factions in China reflect the contradictions and struggles among the imperialist countries. Therefore, as long as the situation of various imperialist powers dividing China exists, the various warlord factions will never be able to compromise, and all compromises are temporary. Today's temporary compromise is brewing a bigger war tomorrow.
    China urgently needs a bourgeois democratic revolution, which must be completed under the leadership of the proletariat. The revolution from 1926 to 1927, which started from Guangdong and developed towards the Yangtze River, was taken over by the comprador and landlord gentry class because the proletariat did not resolutely exercise its leadership, and counter-revolution replaced revolution. The bourgeois democratic revolution encountered a temporary failure. The Chinese proletariat and peasants suffered great blows in this failure, and the Chinese bourgeoisie (non-comprador and landlord gentry class) also suffered blows. However, in recent months, organized urban strikes and rural uprisings of the working class and peasantry under the leadership of the Communist Party have developed in the north and south. Soldiers in the warlord armies are brewing great unrest due to hunger and cold. At the same time, under the instigation of the Wang Jingwei and Chen Gongbo factions, the bourgeoisie is also developing a considerable reformist movement [4] in the coastal and Yangtze River regions. The development of this movement is a new fact.
    According to the instructions of the international and central authorities, the content of China's democratic revolution includes overthrowing the rule of imperialism and its warlord tools in China, completing the national revolution, and carrying out land revolution to eliminate the feudal exploitation of peasants by the landlord gentry class. The actual movement of this revolution has been developing day by day since the Jinan Massacre in May 1928 [5].
  II. The Reasons for the Occurrence and Existence of China's Red Political Power [6]
    Within a country, a small piece or several small pieces of red political power existing for a long time surrounded by white political power is something that has never happened in any country in the world. The occurrence of this strange phenomenon has its unique reasons. And its existence and development must also have considerable conditions. First, its occurrence cannot be in any imperialist country, nor in any colony directly ruled by imperialism [7], but must be in China, a semi-colonial country with a backward economy indirectly ruled by imperialism. Because this strange phenomenon must be accompanied by another strange phenomenon, that is, wars between white political powers. The various factions of new and old warlords in the country, supported by the comprador and landlord gentry class, have been engaged in continuous wars with each other since the first year of the Republic of China. This is one of the characteristics of semi-colonial China. Not only does no imperialist country in the world have this phenomenon, but also no colony directly ruled by imperialism has this phenomenon. Only countries like China, indirectly ruled by imperialism, have this phenomenon. There are two reasons for this phenomenon, namely, the local agricultural economy (not a unified capitalist economy) and the imperialist policy of dividing and exploiting spheres of influence. Because of the long-term division and war between the white political powers, it provides a condition for a small piece or several small pieces of red areas led by the Communist Party to occur and persist in the middle of the surrounding white political power. The separation of the Xianggan border region is just a small piece among these many small pieces. Some comrades often doubt the existence of such red political power in times of difficulty and danger, and develop pessimistic emotions. This is because they have not found the correct explanation for the occurrence and existence of this red political power. We only need to know that the division and war of China's white political power are continuous, then the occurrence, existence, and increasing development of the red political power are beyond doubt. Second, the places where China's red political power first occurred and can exist for a long time are not those places that have not been affected by the democratic revolution, such as Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and the northern provinces, but those places where the masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and civilians greatly rose up in the bourgeois democratic revolution in 1926 and 1927, such as Hunan, Guangdong, Hubei, Jiangxi, and other provinces. Many places in these provinces once had very large organizations of trade unions and peasant associations, and there were many economic and political struggles of the working class and peasantry against the landlords, gentry, and bourgeoisie. Therefore, Guangzhou produced a three-day urban people's political power, and Haifeng, Lufeng, Xiangdong, Xiangnan, Xianggan border region, Huang'an in Hubei, and other places had peasant separatist regimes [8]. As for the occurrence of the Red Army at this moment, it is also differentiated from the National Revolutionary Army that has undergone democratic political training and accepted the influence of the worker and peasant masses. Those armies that have not undergone democratic political training and have not accepted the influence of workers and peasants, such as the armies of Yan Xishan and Zhang Zuolin, cannot be differentiated into components that can create the Red Army at this time. Third, whether the people's political power in small places can exist for a long time depends on the condition of whether the national revolutionary situation is developing forward. If the national revolutionary situation is developing forward, then the long-term existence of small red areas is not only without doubt, but also must be a force among the many forces that will acquire national power. If the national revolutionary situation is not continuously developing forward, but has a relatively long period of stagnation, then the long-term existence of small red areas is impossible. Now China's revolutionary situation is continuously developing forward following the continuous division and war between the domestic comprador and landlord gentry class and the international bourgeoisie. Therefore, not only is the long-term existence of small red areas without doubt, but these red areas will continue to develop and gradually approach the acquisition of national power. Fourth, the existence of a formal Red Army with considerable strength is a necessary condition for the existence of red political power. If there are only local Red Guards [9] without a formal Red Army, they can only deal with household regiments [10], but cannot deal with formal white armies. Therefore, even if there are very good worker and peasant masses, if there is no formal armed force of considerable strength, it is impossible to create a separatist situation, let alone a long-term and increasingly developing separatist situation. Therefore, the idea of "worker-peasant armed separatism" is an important idea that the Communist Party and the worker-peasant masses in the separatist regions must fully possess. Fifth, the long-term existence and development of red political power, in addition to the above conditions, must also have an important condition, that is, the strength of the Communist Party organization and the correctness of its policies.
  III. The Separation of the Xianggan Border Region and the Failure in August
    The division and war between the warlords weakened the ruling power of the white regime. Therefore, the red regime in small places can emerge in time. However, the war between the warlords is not non-stop every day. Whenever there is a temporary stability of the white regime between one or several provinces, the ruling class of that province or several provinces must unite and do their best to eliminate this red regime. In places where the various conditions necessary for establishing and maintaining the red regime are not perfect, there is a danger of being overthrown by the enemy. Many red regimes that arose before April of this year, such as Guangzhou, Haifeng, Lufeng, Xianggan Border Region, Xiangnan, Liling, Huang'an, etc., have all been devastated by the white regime, which is the reason. The separation of the Xianggan Border Region after April coincided with the temporary stability of the ruling power in the South. The troops sent by the Xiang and Gan provinces to suppress it always had more than eight or nine regiments, and sometimes as many as eighteen regiments. However, we fought the enemy with less than four regiments for four months, making the separatist area expand day by day, the land revolution deepen day by day, the organization of the people's regime promoted day by day, and the Red Army and Red Guards grow day by day. The reason lies in the correctness of the policies of the Communist Party (local party and military party) in the Xianggan Border Region. At that time, the policies of the Special Committee and the Military Committee were: resolutely fight against the enemy, create a regime in the middle section of the Luoxiao Mountains [11], and oppose escapeism. Deepen the land revolution in the separatist areas. The army party helps the development of the local party, and the regular army helps the development of the local armed forces. Concentrate the Red Army to deal with the current enemy as appropriate, oppose the division of troops, and avoid being defeated by the enemy one by one. The expansion of the separatist areas adopts a wave-like advancement policy, and opposes the policy of rash advance. etc. Because of the appropriateness of these strategies, coupled with the advantage of the terrain for struggle, and the inconsistency of the attacking troops from the Xiang and Gan provinces, there were victories in various times in the four months from April to July. Even with an enemy several times our size, not only could it not destroy this separation, but it could not stop the increasing expansion of this separation. The influence of this separation on the Xiang and Gan provinces has become increasingly greater. The failure in August was entirely due to the fact that some comrades did not understand that it was a time of temporary stability of the ruling class, but instead adopted the strategy of the political breakdown of the ruling class, divided their forces and advanced rashly, causing the border region and Xiangnan to fail together. Comrade Du Xiujing, representative of the Hunan Provincial Committee, did not observe the current environment, ignored the resolutions of the joint meeting of the Special Committee, Military Committee, and Yongxin County Committee, and only knew to formally implement the orders of the Hunan Provincial Committee, echoing the opinion of the 29th Regiment of the Red Army to avoid struggle and return to their hometown. The error is indeed very large. This situation of failure was salvaged after the Special Committee and the Military Committee took steps to correct the errors after September.
  IV. The Position of the Separated Situation in the Xianggan Border Region in the Three Provinces of Xiang, E, and Gan
    The significance of the worker-peasant armed separation in the Xianggan Border Region centered on Ninggang is by no means limited to several counties in the border region. This separation has great significance in the process of the worker-peasant riots in the three provinces of Xiang, E, and Gan seizing the power of the three provinces. To extend the influence of the land revolution and the people's regime in the border region to the downstream of the Xiang and Gan provinces and even to Hubei; to make the Red Army increase its quantity and quality day by day from the struggle, and to be able to carry out its necessary mission in the overall riots of the three provinces in the future; to make the quantity of local armed forces in various counties, namely the Red Guards and the worker-peasant riot teams, increase and the quality improve, so that they can fight against household regiments and a small number of troops at this time, and be able to protect the border regime in the future; to make the local work talents gradually reduce their reliance on the help of the work talents in the Red Army, be able to completely stand on their own, and to appoint the talents in the border region to work in the border region, and further be able to supply the work talents of the Red Army and the work talents for expanding the separated areas: These are all extremely important tasks of the Border Region Party in the development of the riots in the three provinces of Xiang, E, and Gan.
  V. Economic Issues
    Surrounded by white forces on all sides, the lack of daily necessities and cash for the military and civilians has become a huge problem. For a year, the areas separated by the border regime have been in great lack and great expense of daily necessities such as salt, cloth, and medicine due to the enemy's strict blockade, which has caused anxiety in the lives of the workers, peasants, petty bourgeoisie [12], and Red Army soldiers, sometimes reaching the extreme. The Red Army has to fight on the one hand and raise funds on the other. Even the five cents of food expenses per day excluding grain are lacking, and malnutrition is common, with many illnesses, and the wounded soldiers in the hospital suffer even more. This difficulty is of course unavoidable before the national power is acquired, but the relatively resolution of this difficulty, making life relatively better, especially making the Red Army's supplies relatively sufficient, is urgently needed. If the Border Region Party cannot have an appropriate solution to the economic problem, and under the condition that the enemy's power is still stable for a relatively long period, the separation will encounter great difficulties. The considerable solution to this economic problem is really worth the attention of every party member.
  VI. Military Base Area Issues
    The Border Region Party also has a task, which is to consolidate the two military base areas of Daxiaowujing and Jiulong. The Daxiaowujing mountainous area at the junction of Yongxin, Lingxian, Ninggang, and Suichuan counties, and the Jiulong mountainous area at the junction of Yongxin, Ninggang, Chaling, and Lianhua counties [13], these two places with superior terrain, especially Daxiaowujing, which is both supported by the people and has extremely dangerous terrain, are not only important military base areas in the border region at this time, but will still be important military base areas in the future development of riots in the three provinces of Xiang, E, and Gan. The methods to consolidate this base area are: first, build complete fortifications; second, reserve sufficient grain; third, build a better Red Army hospital. Doing these three things well is what the Border Region Party should strive for.
    Appendix:
    [1] Comrade Mao Zedong is referring to the national bourgeoisie here. In "On Tactics Against Japanese Imperialism," written in December 1935, and "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," written in December 1939, Comrade Mao Zedong gave a detailed explanation of the difference between the comprador big bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie.
    [2] The Jiang faction refers to the Jiang Jieshi faction. The Gui faction refers to the Guangxi warlords Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi factions. The Feng faction refers to the Feng Yuxiang faction. The Yan faction refers to the Shanxi warlord Yan Xishan faction. They had jointly fought against Zhang Zuolin and occupied Beijing and Tianjin in June 1928.
    [3] Zhang Zuolin was the leader of the Feng clique warlords. After Wu Peifu was defeated by Zhang Zuolin in the Second Zhili-Fengtian War in 1924, Zhang Zuolin became the most powerful warlord in the north. In 1926, he joined forces with Wu Peifu to occupy Beijing. In June 1928, he retreated from Beijing to the northeast and was bombed to death by the Japanese imperialists, who had always used him as a tool, on the way.
    [4] After the Japanese bandits occupied Jinan on May 3, 1928, and Chiang Kai-shek openly and shamelessly compromised with Japan, a part of the national bourgeoisie, who had followed the counter-revolutionary coup in 1927, began to gradually form an opposition faction in the Chiang Kai-shek regime because of their own interests. At that time, the speculative counter-revolutionary factions such as Wang Jingwei and Chen Gongbo carried out activities in this movement, forming the so-called "reorganization faction" in the Kuomintang.
    [5] In 1928, Chiang Kai-shek, with the support of British and American imperialism, went north to attack Zhang Zuolin. In order to prevent the expansion of British and American forces to the north, Japanese imperialism sent troops to occupy Jinan, the capital of Shandong Province, cutting off the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. On May 3, the Japanese invading army massacred many Chinese people in Jinan. This massacre is called the "Jinan Massacre."
    [6] The organizational form of China's red political power is similar to that of the Soviet regime. The Soviet, meaning the council of representatives, was a political system created by the Russian working class during the revolution in 1905. Lenin and Stalin, proceeding from the theory of Marxism, concluded that the Soviet republic is the most appropriate socio-political organizational form in the transition period from capitalism to socialism. In the Russian October Socialist Revolution in 1917, under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party of Lenin and Stalin, the socialist Soviet republic of the dictatorship of the proletariat was realized for the first time in the world. After the failure of the Chinese revolution in 1927, the local people's revolutionary uprisings led by the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong took the council of representatives as the form of the people's political power. However, at this stage of the revolution in China, the nature of this political power is the people's democratic dictatorship of the new democratic revolution against imperialism and feudalism under the leadership of the proletariat, which is different from the nature of the proletarian dictatorship in the Soviet Union.
    [7] During the Second World War, many eastern colonies originally under the rule of British, American, French, and Dutch imperialisms were occupied by Japanese imperialists. The workers, peasants, urban petty bourgeoisie, and national bourgeoisie there, under the leadership of the Communist Party, took advantage of the contradictions between British, American, French, and Dutch imperialisms and Japanese imperialism, organized a broad united front against fascism, established anti-Japanese base areas, and carried out arduous anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare, which had begun to change the political situation before the Second World War. With the end of World War II and the expulsion of Japanese imperialism, the American, British, French, and Dutch imperialisms attempted to continue their original colonial rule, but the people in various colonies had already developed a fairly powerful armed force in the anti-Japanese war. They were unwilling to live as before; and due to the strength of the Soviet Union, due to the fact that all imperialist countries except the United States were either overthrown or weakened in the war, and even more due to the victory of the Chinese revolution breaking through the imperialist front in China, the entire imperialist system has undergone great upheavals in the world. In this way, the people of various colonies in the East, at least some colonies, have the possibility, almost the same as China, to persist in revolutionary base areas and revolutionary political power of varying sizes for a long time, to persist in revolutionary wars of encircling the cities from the countryside for a long time, and to gradually advance from this to acquire the cities and the victory of the entire colony. According to the development of this new situation, Comrade Mao Zedong's observation in 1928 on this issue under the conditions of colonies directly ruled by imperialism has changed.
    [8] This refers to the initial counterattacks against the counter-revolutionary forces launched by the people in various places under the leadership of the Communist Party after Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei successively betrayed the revolution in 1927. In Guangzhou, on December 11, 1927, workers and revolutionary soldiers united to launch an uprising and established the people's regime. They fought fiercely with the counter-revolutionary army directly aided by imperialism, but because of the great disparity in strength, this people's uprising failed. The peasants in Haifeng, Lufeng, and other places in eastern Guangdong Province had formed a powerful movement under the leadership of Comrade Peng Pai, a Communist Party member, from 1923 to 1925, which greatly helped the victory of the Guangzhou National Revolutionary Army's two eastern expeditions against the counter-revolutionary Chen Jiongming. After Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolution on April 12, the peasants in the area launched three uprisings successively in April, September, and October, and established a revolutionary regime in the Haifeng and Lufeng area, which persisted until April 1928. In the eastern part of Hunan Province, in September 1927, the uprising peasants had occupied the towns of Liuyang, Pingjiang, Liling, Zhuzhou, etc. At the same time, in Xiaogan, Macheng, Huang'an, and other places in northeastern Hubei Province, there were armed uprisings of tens of thousands of peasants, who occupied Huang'an County for more than 30 days. In southern Hunan, in January 1928, the uprising peasants of Yizhang, Chenzhou, Leiyang, Yongxing, Zixing, and other counties established a revolutionary regime for as long as three months.
    [9] The Red Guards are mass armed organizations in revolutionary base areas that do not separate from production.
    [10] Household regiments are local landlord class counter-revolutionary armed organizations.
    [11] The Luoxiao Mountains are a large mountain range on the border between Jiangxi and Hunan provinces. Jinggangshan is located in the middle section of the Luoxiao Mountains.
    [12] The petty bourgeoisie referred to here by Comrade Mao Zedong refers to handicraftsmen, small merchants, various self-employed professionals, and intellectuals from petty-bourgeois origin other than peasants. These social components in China are mainly in towns, but also account for a considerable number in rural areas. Refer to the article "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society."
    [13] The Daxiaowujing mountainous area refers to the Jinggang Mountains at the junction of Yongxin, Ninggang, and Suichuan in western Jiangxi and Lingxian in eastern Hunan, because there are places such as Dajing, Xiaojing, Shangjing, Zhongjing, and Xiajing in the Jinggang Mountains. The Jiulong mountainous area is located at the junction of Chaling in Hunan and Lianhua, Yongxin, and Ninggang in Jiangxi.

　　中国的红色政权为什么能够存在？  （一九二八年十月五日）
    毛泽东
    这是毛泽东同志为湘赣边区党的第二次代表大会写的决议的一部分，原题为：《政治问题和边界党的任务》。
        毛泽东选集出版委员会
  一  国内的政治状况
    现在国民党新军阀的统治，依然是城市买办阶级和乡村豪绅阶级的统治，对外投降帝国主义，对内以新军阀代替旧军阀，对工农阶级的经济的剥削和政治的压迫比从前更加厉害。从广东出发的资产阶级民主革命，到半路被买办豪绅阶级篡夺了去，立即转向反革命路上，全国工农平民以至资产阶级〔一〕，依然在反革命统治底下，没有得到丝毫政治上经济上的解放。
    国民党新军阀蒋桂冯阎四派〔二〕，在北京天津没有打下以前，有一个对张作霖〔三〕的临时的团结。北京天津打下以后，这个团结立即解散，变为四派内部激烈斗争的局面，蒋桂两派且在酝酿战争中。中国内部各派军阀的矛盾和斗争，反映着帝国主义各国的矛盾和斗争。故只要各国帝国主义分裂中国的状况存在，各派军阀就无论如何不能妥协，所有妥协都是暂时的。今天的暂时的妥协，即酝酿着明天的更大的战争。
    中国迫切需要一个资产阶级的民主革命，这个革命必须是由无产阶级领导才能完成。从广东出发向长江发展的一九二六年到一九二七年的革命，因为无产阶级没有坚决地执行自己的领导权，被买办豪绅阶级夺取了领导，以反革命代替了革命。资产阶级民主革命乃遭遇着暂时的失败。中国无产阶级和农民在此次失败中，碰着很大的打击，中国资产阶级（非买办豪绅阶级）也碰了打击。但最近数个月来，工农阶级在共产党领导之下的有组织的城市罢工和农村暴动，在南北各地发展起来。军阀军队中的士兵因饥寒而酝酿着很大的不安。同时资产阶级在汪精卫、陈公博一派鼓动之下，亦在沿海沿江各地发展着颇大的改良主义运动〔四〕。这种运动的发展是新的事实。
    中国的民主革命的内容，依国际及中央的指示，包括推翻帝国主义及其工具军阀在中国的统治，完成民族革命，并实行土地革命，消灭豪绅阶级对农民的封建的剥削。这种革命的实际运动，在一九二八年五月济南惨案〔五〕以后，是一天一天在发展的。
  二  中国红色政权〔六〕发生和存在的原因
    一国之内，在四围白色政权的包围中，有一小块或若干小块红色政权的区域长期地存在，这是世界各国从来没有的事。这种奇事的发生，有其独特的原因。而其存在和发展，亦必有相当的条件。第一，它的发生不能在任何帝国主义的国家，也不能在任何帝国主义直接统治的殖民地〔七〕，必然是在帝国主义间接统治的经济落后的半殖民地的中国。因为这种奇怪现象必定伴着另外一件奇怪现象，那就是白色政权之间的战争。买办豪绅阶级支持着的国内各派新旧军阀，从民国元年以来，相互间进行着继续不断的战争，这是半殖民地中国的特征之一。不但全世界帝国主义国家没有一国有这种现象，就是帝国主义直接统治的殖民地也没有一处有这种现象，仅仅帝国主义间接统治的中国这样的国家才有这种现象。这种现象产生的原因有两种，即地方的农业经济（不是统一的资本主义经济）和帝国主义划分势力范围的分裂剥削政策。因为有了白色政权间的长期的分裂和战争，便给了一种条件，使一小块或若干小块的共产党领导的红色区域，能够在四围白色政权包围的中间发生和坚持下来。湘赣边界的割据，就是这许多小块中间的一小块。有些同志在困难和危急的时候，往往怀疑这样的红色政权的存在，而发生悲观的情绪。这是没有找出这种红色政权所以发生和存在的正确的解释的缘故。我们只须知道中国白色政权的分裂和战争是继续不断的，则红色政权的发生、存在并且日益发展，便是无疑的了。第二，中国红色政权首先发生和能够长期地存在的地方，不是那种并未经过民主革命影响的地方，例如四川、贵州、云南及北方各省，而是在一九二六和一九二七两年资产阶级民主革命过程中工农兵士群众曾经大大地起来过的地方，例如湖南、广东、湖北、江西等省。这些省份的许多地方，曾经有过很广大的工会和农民协会的组织，有过工农阶级对地主豪绅阶级和资产阶级的许多经济的政治的斗争。所以广州产生过三天的城市民众政权，而海陆丰、湘东、湘南、湘赣边界、湖北的黄安等地都有过农民的割据〔八〕。至于此刻红军的发生，也是由经过民主的政治训练和接受过工农群众影响的国民革命军中分化出来的。那些毫未经过民主的政治训练、毫未接受过工农影响的军队，例如阎锡山、张作霖的军队，此时便决然不能分化出可以造成红军的成份来。第三，小地方民众政权之能否长期地存在，则决定于全国革命形势是否向前发展这一个条件。全国革命形势是向前发展的，则小块红色区域的长期存在，不但没有疑义，而且必然地要作取得全国总政权的许多力量中间的一个力量。全国革命形势若不是继续地向前发展，而有一个比较长期的停顿，则小块红色区域的长期存在是不可能的。现在中国革命形势是跟着国内买办豪绅阶级和国际资产阶级的继续的分裂和战争，而继续地向前发展的。所以，不但小块红色区域的长期存在没有疑义，而且这些红色区域将继续发展，日渐接近于全国政权的取得。第四，相当力量的正式红军的存在，是红色政权存在的必要条件。若只有地方性质的赤卫队〔九〕而没有正式的红军，则只能对付挨户团〔一○〕，而不能对付正式白色军队。所以虽有很好的工农群众，若没有相当力量的正式武装，便决然不能造成割据局面，更不能造成长期的和日益发展的割据局面。所以“工农武装割据”的思想，是共产党和割据地方的工农群众必须充分具备的一个重要的思想。第五，红色政权的长期的存在并且发展，除了上述条件之外，还须有一个要紧的条件，就是共产党组织的有力量和它的政策的不错误。
  三  湘赣边界的割据和八月的失败
    军阀间的分裂和战争，削弱了白色政权的统治势力。因此，小地方红色政权得以乘时产生出来。但军阀之间的战争不是每天不停的。每当一省或几省之间的白色政权有一个暂时稳定的时候，那一省的统治阶级或几省的统治阶级必然联合起来用尽力量来消灭这个红色政权。在为建立和坚持红色政权所必须的各种条件尚不完备的地方，便有被敌人推倒的危险。本年四月以前乘时而起的许多红色政权，如广州、海陆丰、湘赣边界、湘南、醴陵、黄安各地，都先后受到白色政权的摧残，就是这个道理。四月以后湘赣边界的割据，正值南方统治势力暂时稳定的时候，湘赣两省派来进剿的军队，随时都有八、九个团以上的兵力，多的到过十八个团。然而我们以不足四个团的兵力和敌人斗争四个月之久，使割据地区一天一天扩大，土地革命一天一天深入，民众政权的组织一天一天推广，红军和赤卫队一天一天壮大，原因就在于湘赣边界的共产党（地方的党和军队的党）的政策是正确的。当时党的特委和军委的政策是：坚决地和敌人作斗争，创造罗霄山脉〔一一〕中段政权，反对逃跑主义。深入割据地区的土地革命。军队党帮助地方党的发展，正规军队帮助地方武装的发展。集中红军相机应付当前之敌，反对分兵，避免被敌人各个击破。割据地区的扩大采取波浪式的推进政策，反对冒进政策。等等。因为这些策略的适当，加上地形之利于斗争，湘赣两省进攻军队之不尽一致，于是才有四月至七月四个月中的各次胜利。虽以数倍于我之敌，不但不能破坏此割据，并且不能阻止此割据的日益扩大，此割据对湘赣两省的影响则有日益加大之势。八月失败，完全在于一部分同志不明了当时正是统治阶级暂时稳定的时候，反而采取统治阶级政治破裂时候的战略，分兵冒进，致边界和湘南同归失败。湖南省委代表杜修经同志不察当时环境，不顾特委、军委及永新县委联席会议的决议，只知形式地执行湖南省委的命令，附和红军第二十九团逃避斗争欲回家乡的意见，其错误实在非常之大。这种失败的形势，因为九月以后特委和军委采取了纠正错误的步骤，而挽救过来了。
  四  湘赣边界的割据局面在湘鄂赣三省的地位
    以宁冈为中心的湘赣边界工农武装割据，其意义决不限于边界数县，这种割据在湘鄂赣三省工农暴动夺取三省政权的过程中是有很大的意义的。使边界土地革命和民众政权的影响远及于湘赣两省的下游乃至于湖北；使红军从斗争中日益增加其数量和质量，能在将来三省总的暴动中执行它的必要的使命；使各县地方武装即赤卫队和工农暴动队的数量增加质量提高起来，此时能够与挨户团和小量军队作战，将来能够保全边界政权；使地方工作人材逐渐减少依靠红军中工作人材的帮助，能完全自立，以边界的人材任边界的工作，进一步能够供给红军的工作人材和扩大割据区域的工作人材：——这些都是边界党在湘鄂赣三省暴动发展中极其重要的任务。
  五  经济问题
    在白色势力的四面包围中，军民日用必需品和现金的缺乏，成了极大的问题。一年以来，边界政权割据的地区，因为敌人的严密封锁，食盐、布匹、药材等日用必需品，无时不在十分缺乏和十分昂贵之中，因此引起工农小资产阶级〔一二〕群众和红军士兵群众的生活的不安，有时真是到了极度。红军一面要打仗，一面又要筹饷。每天除粮食外的五分钱伙食费都感到缺乏，营养不足，病的甚多，医院伤兵，其苦更甚。这种困难，在全国总政权没有取得以前当然是不能免的，但是这种困难的比较地获得解决，使生活比较地好一点，特别是红军的给养使之比较地充足一点，则是迫切地需要的。边界党如不能对经济问题有一个适当的办法，在敌人势力的稳定还有一个比较长的期间的条件下，割据将要遇到很大的困难。这个经济问题的相当的解决，实在值得每个党员注意。
  六  军事根据地问题
    边界党还有一个任务，就是大小五井和九陇两个军事根据地的巩固。永新、酃县、宁冈、遂川四县交界的大小五井山区，和永新、宁冈、茶陵、莲花四县交界的九陇山区〔一三〕，这两个地形优越的地方，特别是既有民众拥护、地形又极险要的大小五井，不但在边界此时是重要的军事根据地，就是在湘鄂赣三省暴动发展的将来，亦将仍然是重要的军事根据地。巩固此根据地的方法：第一，修筑完备的工事；第二，储备充足的粮食；第三，建设较好的红军医院。把这三件事切实做好，是边界党应该努力的。
    附注：
    〔一〕毛泽东同志在这里指的是民族资产阶级。毛泽东同志在一九三五年十二月作的《论反对日本帝国主义的策略》和一九三九年十二月作的《中国革命和中国共产党》中，对于买办大资产阶级与民族资产阶级的区别，曾作了详细的说明。
    〔二〕蒋派指蒋介石派。桂派指广西军阀李宗仁白崇禧派。冯派指冯玉祥派。阎派指山西军阀阎锡山派。他们曾联合对张作霖作战，于一九二八年六月占领了北京和天津。
    〔三〕张作霖是奉系军阀首领。一九二四年吴佩孚在第二次奉直战争中被打败后，张作霖成为北方最有势力的一个军阀。一九二六年他联合吴佩孚入据北京。一九二八年六月从北京退回东北，在路上被向来利用他做工具的日本帝国主义者所炸死。
    〔四〕一九二八年五月三日日寇占领济南及蒋介石公开无耻地对日妥协之后，曾经追随过一九二七年反革命政变的民族资产阶级，有一部分因为自己的利益，开始逐步形成蒋介石政权的在野反对派。当时汪精卫陈公博等这个投机的反革命政派，曾在这个运动中进行活动，形成了国民党中的所谓“改组派”。
    〔五〕一九二八年蒋介石在英美帝国主义支持下，北上攻打张作霖。日本帝国主义为阻止英美势力向北方发展，出兵侵占山东省会济南，截断津浦铁路。五月三日，日本侵略军在济南屠杀很多的中国人。这个屠杀称为“济南惨案”。
    〔六〕中国红色政权的组织形式近似于苏维埃政权。苏维埃即代表会议，为俄国工人阶级于一九○五年革命时创造的一种政治制度。列宁斯大林从马克思主义的理论出发而得出结论，认为苏维埃的共和国是从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期中最适当的社会政治组织形式。一九一七年俄国十月社会主义革命，在列宁斯大林的布尔塞维克党的领导之下，第一次在世界上实现了这种无产阶级专政的社会主义的苏维埃共和国。在中国一九二七年的革命失败之后，中国共产党以毛泽东同志为首所领导的各地民众革命起义，即以代表会议为民众政权的形式。但在中国这个革命阶段，这种政权的性质，是无产阶级领导的反帝反封建的新民主主义革命的人民民主专政，这是和苏联的无产阶级专政的政权性质有区别的。
    〔七〕在第二次世界大战期间，原来属于英、美、法、荷各帝国主义统治下的东方许多殖民地，被日本帝国主义者所占领，那里的工人、农民、城市小资产阶级群众及民族资产阶级分子在共产党领导下，利用英、美、法、荷各帝国主义与日本帝国主义的矛盾，组织了反法西斯侵略的广泛统一战线，建立了抗日根据地，进行了坚苦的抗日游击战争，已开始改变了第二次世界大战以前的政治情况。第二次世界大战结束，日本帝国主义被逐出，美、英、法、荷各帝国主义企图继续原来的殖民地统治，但各殖民地人民已在抗日战争中锻炼出了一种相当有力的武装力量，他们不愿意照旧生活下去；而由于苏联的强大，由于除美国以外的一切帝国主义国家在战争中或被推翻或被削弱，更由于中国革命的胜利使帝国主义阵线在中国被突破，因而使整个帝国主义制度已在世界上发生很大的动摇。这样，就使东方各殖民地至少是某些殖民地的人民也和中国差不多一样地有可能长期坚持大小不一的革命根据地和革命政权，有可能长期坚持由乡村包围城市的革命战争，并有可能由此逐步推进而取得城市、取得该殖民地全国范围内的胜利。根据这种新情况的发展，毛泽东同志于一九二八年对于在帝国主义直接统治的殖民地条件下这一个问题上所作的观察，已有了改变。
    〔八〕这是指在一九二七年蒋介石汪精卫相继叛变革命后，各地人民在共产党领导下最初爆发起来的对反革命势力的反击行动。在广州，一九二七年十二月十一日，工人和革命士兵联合起义，建立了人民的政权，曾和那在帝国主义直接援助下的反革命军队进行激烈的战斗，但因力量相差很大，这个人民的起义是失败了。广东省东部沿海的海丰、陆丰等地的农民，当一九二三年至一九二五年，在共产党员澎湃同志的领导下，已经形成了强大的运动，对于广州国民革命军两次东征反革命派陈炯明的胜利，给了很大的帮助。一九二七年四月十二日蒋介石反革命后，该地农民于四月、九月、十月，先后举行三次起义，在海丰陆丰一带建立过革命政权，一直坚持到一九二八年四月。在湖南省东部，一九二七年九月，起义的农民曾经占据过浏阳、平江、醴陵、株州等城镇。与此同时，在湖北省东北部的孝感、麻城、黄安等地，曾有数万农民的武装起义，占领黄安县城三十余日。在湖南南部，一九二八年一月，宜章、郴州、耒阳、永兴、资兴等县的起义农民，建立过革命政权达三月之久。
    〔九〕赤卫队是革命根据地中群众的武装组织，不脱离生产。
    〔一○〕挨户团是地方性的地主阶级的反革命武装组织。
    〔一一〕罗霄山脉是江西湖南两省边界的大山脉，井冈山居于罗霄山脉的中段。
    〔一二〕毛泽东同志这里所说的小资产阶级，是指农民以外的手工业者、小商人、各种自由职业者和小资产阶级出身的知识分子。中国此等社会成份主要在城镇，但在乡村中也占有相当数量。参考《中国社会各阶级的分析》一文。
    〔一三〕大小五井山区就是指界于江西西部的永新、宁冈、遂川和湖南东部的酃县四县之间的井冈山，因为在井冈山上有大井、小井、上井、中井、下井等地。九陇山区在湖南的茶陵和江西的莲花、永新、宁冈四县交界。
