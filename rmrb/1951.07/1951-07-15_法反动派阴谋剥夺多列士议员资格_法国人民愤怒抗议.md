　　French Reactionaries Conspire to Deprive Thorez of His Parliamentary Seat
    French People Angrily Protest
    [Xinhua News Agency, July 12th] Paris Dispatch: De Gaulle's fascist party, the Rally of the French People, recently used the pretext of French Communist Party General Secretary Thorez receiving medical treatment in the Soviet Union to demand that the National Assembly declare Thorez's parliamentary qualification invalid. The right-wing majority in the National Assembly is even prepared to discuss this issue. This shameless act by the French reactionaries has aroused angry protests from the French people. Protest rallies are being held in various French cities to oppose the conspiracy to deprive Thorez of his parliamentary seat.
    In the Seine Department, where Thorez was elected as a member of parliament, the Communist Party's Provincial Committee issued a protest stating: The National Assembly actually intends to debate the legitimacy of the election of Thorez, our country's most enthusiastic defender of peace, our people's finest son, the National Assembly's top member, and our party's General Secretary. The Communist Party Seine Provincial Committee calls on all its members to rise up and organize and lead a broad protest movement. The protest emphasizes: Let the sound of protest be heard everywhere! Let all honest people express their indignation and declare their determination to stop this shameful fascist conspiracy!

　　法反动派阴谋剥夺多列士议员资格
    法国人民愤怒抗议
    【新华社十二日讯】巴黎消息：戴高乐的法西斯党法兰西人民联盟最近以法国共产党总书记多列士在苏联治病为借口，要求国民议会宣布多列士的议员资格为无效，国民议会中的右翼多数并已准备对这个问题进行讨论。法国反动派的这种无耻行径，已经激起了法国人民愤怒的抗议。法国各城市都在举行抗议集会，反对企图剥夺多列士议员资格的阴谋。
    在多列士当选议员的塞纳省，共产党省委员会发出抗议书说：国民议会竟打算就我国最热情的和平保卫者、我国人民最优秀的儿子、国民议会的第一名议员、我们党的总书记多列士当选的正当性，进行辩论。共产党塞纳省委会号召所属全体党员起来组织并领导广泛的抗议运动。抗议书强调：让各处都听到抗议的声音吧！让一切正直人们表示他们的愤慨，并申明他们决心阻止这个可耻的法西斯阴谋吧！
