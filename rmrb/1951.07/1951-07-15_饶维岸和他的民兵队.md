　　Rao Weian and His Militia Team
　　Chen Chuang
    At the recent hero model representative conference held by the Zhejiang Military Region, there was an outstanding militia model, Rao Weian, who made great contributions in defending the motherland's coast.
    Rao Weian is a patriotic fisherman whose home is on a crab-claw-shaped peninsula in southern Zhejiang that juts into the East China Sea. It faces the island of Nanji, where sea bandits are entrenched. Since 1949, his hometown has become a passage for sea bandits to land and land bandits to go to sea, especially a necessary route for sea bandits from Nanji Island to land and sabotage the motherland's construction. Rao Weian is a man who has suffered greatly from the Kuomintang bandits. He himself was arrested four times by the reactionary Kuomintang government, and even his mother and wife were arrested by the bandits and their whereabouts are still unknown. After the liberation of his hometown, Rao Weian's life gradually improved, but bandits continued to harass his hometown. In order to protect his happy days and prevent the "plague" from recurring, Rao Weian, under the leadership of the local people's government, organized fishermen and farmers to establish a militia team to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to defend the gate of the motherland.
    At noon on July 3rd last year, a militiaman suddenly ran to report: "Four! Quick! Four bandit ships are rushing in!" Rao Weian jumped up upon hearing this, immediately put his gun on his back, and gathered a dozen militiamen to go up the mountain. This time the situation was very serious! Fifty or sixty sea bandits shouted and cheered each other on the ships, and small cannons, rocket launchers, and machine guns sent rocks flying on the mountain. Rao Weian told everyone: "The enemy is just a flash in the pan – fierce at the beginning. As long as we stay calm, we'll make those grandsons unable to get up here." As he spoke, he organized everyone, firing a few shots in the east for a while, and then a few shots in the west, confusing the sea bandits. They didn't know how many people were defending the mountain, so they rushed over from both sides. The militia team aimed at the leading bandit ship and fired. As a result, the sea bandits had to turn the bow of their ship to avoid it. Although the sea bandits launched more than ten consecutive attacks, they still couldn't get onto the mainland. Looking down from the mountain, the bandit ships were like headless flies, anxiously spinning around in the sea. When the bandit ships concentrated and charged from the front for the last time, Rao Weian waved his hand and the militia fired together, breaking the mast of the leading bandit ship. With a crash, the canvas immediately fell down. By this time, the sun was almost setting, and the tide was crashing against the cliffs. Seeing that there was no way to succeed, the sea bandits had to lower their heads and row back dejectedly.
    After that, the sea bandits came to attack several more times, but still had no way to succeed, and never crossed the mainland. However, Rao Weian and his militia team not only did not become paralyzed because of this, but became even more vigilant. During the day, they carried their guns and went to the sea to produce collectively, sometimes helping fishermen push boats and carry fish; at night, the militia slept together, taking turns on sentry duty and patrolling. Once, when sea bandits robbed a merchant ship sailing north from Fuzhou, Rao Weian's militia team took the initiative to cooperate with the district squadron to attack, driving the sea bandits to flee in panic and ensuring the safety of the merchant ship.
    One day, Rao Weian received intelligence again: "Bandits are going to sea in a certain place." While reporting the situation to the district squadron, he quickly led the militia to the sea to investigate. It was already 8:00 p.m. He faintly saw a seagoing ship heading towards Nanji Island. They steered their boat around to the front, and when the boat approached, he led everyone to jump on it and search. They seized 13 rifles, 2 pistols, and more than 400 catties of rice on the spot. It turned out to be a bandit ship. Rao Weian also learned from the prisoners that the sea bandits entrenched on Nanji Island were short of food, and one person could not even eat 12 taels of sweet potato flour a day. Based on this situation, he led the militia to patrol and inspect the sea day and night. He said to the militia: "If we guard the coast well and don't let a grain of food go to sea, the sea bandits will starve to death."
    Under the active attack of Rao Weian's militia team, it was difficult for the sea bandits to even go out for activities, let alone grab food. The bandit detachment leader Lin Xuezheng and squad leader Chen Tinglin and four others were caught by Rao Weian and his militia team shortly after they sneaked ashore from Taiwan. Rao Weian's militia team drove the sea bandits to a dead end.
    In the past two years, they have defeated six harassments by sea bandits and captured alive the most famous sea bandit leader in the coastal area of ​​Minzhe - Wang Dingzhi, commander of the First Division of the Anti-Communist National Salvation Army of the Southeast People's Bandit. They also cooperated with the People's Liberation Army to liberate the three islands of Dongtou Island, Damen Mountain, and Luqi Mountain.
    In order to commend Rao Weian and his militia team for their heroic deeds in defending the motherland's national defense, the local people's government awarded them eleven certificates, and the fishermen and farmers enthusiastically held a celebration meeting and collected two earthen cannons to send to Rao Weian's militia team. They said: "With the People's Liberation Army and Rao Weian's militia team, we can sleep peacefully at night."
    Now, Rao Weian has established a strong joint defense organization along the coast, and has launched a competition to defend the coast with the militia on the nearby coastal defense line. As long as enemy situation is discovered, with one signal, militiamen from all over the place will attack the enemy from all directions. They have become a capable assistant to the People's Liberation Army in defending the national defense.

　　饶维岸和他的民兵队
　　陈窗
    浙江军区最近召开的英雄模范代表大会上，有一个出色的民兵模范饶维岸，他在守卫祖国海防中立了大功。
    饶维岸是一个爱国的渔民，他的家在浙南一个伸入东海的蟹钳形的半岛上。那里正和海匪盘据的孤岛南麂山遥遥相对。从一九四九年开始，他的家乡就变成了海上土匪登陆和陆地土匪下海的要道，特别是变成了南麂山海匪登陆破坏祖国建设的必经之路。饶维岸是个受尽蒋匪摧残的人，他自己曾被国民党反动政府抓去过四次，连母亲妻子都给蒋匪抓去，至今下落不明。家乡解放以后，饶维岸的生活渐渐好转，但是土匪却又不断地来骚扰他的家乡。为了保卫幸福的日子，不使“瘟疫”重临，饶维岸就在当地人民政府领导下把渔民和农民组织起来，建立了一支民兵队，配合人民解放军坚守着祖国的大门。
    去年七月三号中午，忽然一个民兵跑来报告：“四只！快！四只匪船冲进来了！”饶维岸一听蹦了起来，立即背好枪，集合十几个民兵上了山。这次情况可严重啊！五、六十个海匪，在船上互相呐喊助威，小炮、火箭炮、机关枪，打得山头上石块乱飞。饶维岸告诉大家：“敌人只是三把火——开头凶，只要沉住气，管叫龟孙子上不来。”说着，他把大家组织好，一忽儿在东面打几枪，一忽儿又在西面打几枪，把海匪打得糊里糊涂，不知道山头上究竟有多少人防守，赶忙分两边冲过来。民兵队对准领头的匪船就打，这样一来，海匪只好掉过船头向侧面躲避。海匪虽然连续进攻了十多次，还是上不了大陆。从山上望下去，匪船就像几只没头的苍蝇，急得在海里乱打转。当匪船最后一次集中从正面冲过来时，饶维岸将手一挥，民兵一齐开火，把最前面那只匪船上的桅杆打断了。只听得哗啦啦一声，帆布立即掉了下来。这时太阳已快下山了，海潮哗啦、哗啦地扑打着崖岸，海匪眼看没有办法，只好垂头丧气地摇着橹退回去了。
    以后海匪又来进攻了好几次，依然是毫无办法，始终跨不上大陆一步。但是饶维岸和他的民兵队不仅没有因此而麻痹，却反而更加警惕了。他们白天背着枪集体下海生产，有时还帮助渔民推船、挑鱼；晚上，民兵集中睡觉，轮流放哨巡逻。有一次，海匪在海上抢劫一只从福州向北开的商船，饶维岸民兵队就主动配合区中队出击，把海匪打得狼狈逃窜，使商船安全出险了。
    有一天，饶维岸又得到情报：“某地有土匪下海。”他一面把情况报告区中队，一面就迅速带领民兵下海盘查。那时，已经是晚上八点钟了，他隐隐地看到一只海船向南麂山开去。他们驾船绕到前面，等到那只船靠近了，他带领大家跳上去一搜查，当场缴到步枪十三支，手枪两支，大米四百余斤，原来正是一只匪船。饶维岸还从俘虏口里得到消息：盘据在南麂山的海匪正缺乏粮食，一个人一天连十二两蕃芋干也吃不到。他根据这个情况，就日夜带领民兵，在海上巡逻盘查。他对民兵说：“我们好好守卫海岸，不让一粒粮食下海，管叫海匪活活地饿死。”
    在饶维岸民兵队的主动打击下，海匪不要说抢粮食，就是稍为外出活动一下也很困难了。匪支队长林薛政、分队长陈亭林等四人，从台湾偷偷上岸不久，就被饶维岸和他的民兵队逮住了。饶维岸民兵队把海匪打得走头无路。
    这两年来，他们曾打败海匪六次骚扰，活捉了闽浙沿海最著名的海匪头子——匪东南人民反共救国军浙闽第一师司令王丁植。他们还配合人民解放军解放了洞头岛、大门山、鹿栖山三个海岛。
    为了表扬饶维岸和他的民兵队在保卫祖国国防中的英勇事迹，当地人民政府曾授予他们十一张奖状，渔民和农民为此热烈地召开了庆祝大会，并搜集了两门土炮送给饶维岸的民兵队。他们说：“有了解放军，又有了饶维岸的民兵队，我们晚上睡觉就安稳了。”
    现在，饶维岸已经在沿海建立了强大的联防组织，和附近海防线上的民兵展开了保卫海防的竞赛。只要发现敌情，一声讯号，各地的民兵就从四面八方向敌人进攻。他们已成为人民解放军保卫国防中的得力助手。
