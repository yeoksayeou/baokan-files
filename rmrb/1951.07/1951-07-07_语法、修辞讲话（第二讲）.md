Grammar and Rhetoric Talk (Lecture 2)
    Section 3: Word Meaning
    Lǚ Shūxiāng, Zhū Déxī
    Explaining the meaning and usage of words is the job of dictionaries. If we had a good dictionary, we wouldn't need to write this section, and we could simply tell everyone to consult the dictionary. But the reality is not like that. Existing dictionaries tend to focus on explanations of ancient language, while neglecting modern vocabulary that is actively used in speech. Although newly compiled dictionaries claim to pay attention to modern vocabulary, their explanations are still not precise enough and cannot provide us with much help. To grasp the meaning and usage of words, the more reliable method is to pay attention and experience them yourself in daily life. Below, we list some things to pay attention to when using words, for your reference.
    Word meaning contains praise or criticism. When describing the same event, two people with different standpoints can have different ways of saying it. For example, in fact, we are "supporting" the Korean people in resisting the aggression of American imperialism, but the American imperialists insist on saying that we are "invading" Korea. Here, two people with opposing standpoints use two different words ("support" and "invade") to describe the same event, and their intentions are completely different. Many words look very similar, but some carry a meaning of praise, some carry a meaning of criticism, and some are neutral. The boundaries are clear and cannot be confused. Using them incorrectly can lead to great jokes or major errors. For example:
    (1) So, expressed in the works, it praises the people and slanders the devils, traitors, and landlords. (Periodical)
    Attacking others without basis is called "slander." Is our attack on "devils, traitors, and landlords" without basis? Those who call our attack "slander" are none other than "devils, traitors, and landlords." The word opposite to "praise" is "curse," but "expose" would be more appropriate in this sentence.
    (2) It should be said that the gains of the Peking University Student Representative Conference exceeded the initial expectations. The basic crux lies in absorbing the experience of the People's Representative Conference, giving full play to democracy, and correctly using democratic centralism to solve possible and necessary problems. (Periodical)
    "Crux" is a classical Chinese word that originally meant "root of the disease." Therefore, it can only be used for examples containing derogatory meaning, such as saying "Lack of unity among ourselves is the crux of not doing a good job." This sentence should use "key" or "reason" (if "key" is used, one cannot say "basic").
    (3) Attlee and Bevin and their ilk still hypocritically say that they are friends and protectors of the British working people. (Periodical)
    "Protect" contains the meaning of "bias." Attlee and Bevin would not be foolish enough to choose such a word to expose themselves. This is a confusion of "protect" and "defend."
    (4) Although my ability is poor, as long as I study hard and control my time, there is still hope. (Work)
    "Control" is a word with a derogatory meaning, such as saying "corrupt officials control politics." Here, "grasp" should be used.
    Using big words in small situations. The meaning of words has differences in size and weight. A common problem is "using big words in small situations," which is like using a knife for slaughtering cattle to kill a chicken; it's a bit inappropriate.
    (5) The family stopped me from participating in the cultural work troupe. (Work)
    (6) Every afternoon from 5:00 to 6:00 is the period for students to exercise. (Work)
    (7) His father is a national capitalist, so our marriage situation is very big. (Letter)
    The "stopped" in (5) should be "prevented," the "period" in (6) should be "time," and the "situation" in (7) should be "scene." There's no need to explain them in detail.
    Single-syllable words and double-syllable words. Generally speaking, the meaning of a double-syllable word is more abstract than the meaning of its equivalent single-syllable word. For example, "singing" is not equal to "sing," but is similar in meaning to "praise," such as saying "singing Mao Zedong."
    (8) We entered the main hall, and facing us was a statue of Maitreya Buddha. (Book)
    (9) After coming down from the front line, I slept for twelve hours in a row. (Periodical)
    (10) Watching the train moving forward. (Periodical)
    (8) should say "walked into the main hall" (compare "Our army entered Tibet"); (9) should say "slept for twelve hours" (compare "sleep deprivation"); (10) should say "watching the train moving forward" (compare "hesitating to move forward").
    Referring to people and referring to things. We only say "He is interested in new poetry," but not "This new poem is very interested." Because "interest" can only be used for people (people have "interest" in things), and "interest" is only used for things (things have "interest").
    (11) But it is estimated that 60 million to 100 million mu of land nationwide has suffered from severe disasters such as floods, droughts, and insect pests, making agricultural production feel great difficulty. (Periodical)
    "Agricultural production" has no feelings and will not "feel." It should say "making agricultural production encounter great difficulties."
    Active and passive. Passive sentences will be discussed in detail in the third lecture. Here, we will only give some examples of the confusion between active and passive caused by the use of words.
    (12) Fluttering the banner of Mao Zedong, singing the song of triumph. (Manuscript)
    The banner can "flutter" itself, but we cannot "flutter" the banner. We should say "waving."
    (13) I still clearly remember that extremely touching scene. (Periodical)
    It is people who are "touched," not the "scene." It must say "touching."
    (14) But the "reed stalk" (human name) is able to endure the suffering day by day (Book)
    (15) Ancient Asia, an Asia shackled by thousands of years of feudal chains... (Newspaper)
    (14) It is not "reed stalk" (human name) who torments others, but others torment "reed stalk." It should say "enduring suffering day by day." (15) should be changed to "Asia, which has been shackled by feudal chains for thousands of years."
    (16) The editor said in the "Foreword": "It is hoped that in the future more strength can be concentrated to produce a relatively complete textbook on the history of the New Democratic Revolution in China." (Newspaper)
    If you say "Hope that a textbook will appear in the future...", that is correct. The sentence says "Hope that in the future more strength can be concentrated...", which contains an unspoken subject "I" or someone else, which is incorrect. Because one can only say "a book appeared" or "a book was published," but one cannot say "so and so published a book." "Appear" should be changed to "write."
    Verbs that echo each other.
    Some verbs, such as "make," "use," "provide," "suffer," etc., are often used in conjunction with other verbs (see Section 4 "Complex Predicates" in the first lecture). When used alone, there are other similar but not identical verbs.
    (17) Using painting to express the war situation, the life of the People's Liberation Army, and the model facts of actively mobilizing to join the army (Periodical)
    We only say "write with a pen" or "eat with the mouth," not "use a pen to write" or "use the mouth to eat." The "use" in this sentence does not echo "express." It should be changed to "with."
    (18) And introduce the actual situation below to provide a reference for the conductors. (Letter)
    "Provide" must be used in conjunction with other verbs, such as saying "provide the conductor comrades with reference." This sentence combines "provide" with a noun (a reference), so the front and back cannot echo each other. Here, "supply" should be used. It can be combined with nouns, such as "supply the conductor comrades with a reference"; it can also be combined with other verbs, such as "supply the conductor comrades with a reference."
    (19) Promote a closer unity between all peace-loving countries and people in the world. (Periodical)
    "Promote" can only be combined with nouns, such as "promote world peace" or "promote the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people." This sentence should use "cause" in order to echo the verb "unite."
    Negation and affirmation.
    (20) Because I am thin and my physique is not very good, I don't have much interest in sports. (Work)
    "Very much" is only used in sentences with an affirmative tone. One can say "have very much interest," but not "do not have very much interest." This sentence should be changed to "have no interest" or "do not have much interest."
    (21) Therefore, the problem could not be resolved for a time. (Periodical)
    "For a time" is also only used in sentences with an affirmative tone, such as saying "He was once unemployed for a time." This sentence should change "for a time" to "for a period of time."
    (22) He took me here and there to participate in any activities. (Work)
    We only say "participate in various activities," or say "do not participate in any activities." (Only when emphasizing the meaning of "any" can it be used in sentences with an affirmative tone, such as "I am willing to do any work.")
    Splitting double-syllable words. Although double-syllable words are formed by combining two characters, they express only a single concept, just like single-syllable words, and cannot be forcibly separated. For example, "Coptis chinensis" (Huang Lian) is not a "yellow" "connecting"; "wife" (laopo) is not an "old" "woman." Now we often see examples of forcibly separating double-syllable words. The most common are verbs, for example:
    (23) I have swum several times with my classmates. (Work)
    (24) No matter what speech he gives, he always inserts a passage about the great principles of "the way of heaven" and "the way of man." (Periodical)
    (25) The children ran around, calling Mom, coaxing and laughing, making a fuss. (Book)
    "Swimming," "giving a speech," and "coaxing and laughing" were originally compound words, but they were forcibly separated and used as verb-object words, which is logically untenable. If they are verb-object words, they are more suitable for splitting, such as "Get a haircut twice a month" or "Get divorced and remarry." But it also depends on whether custom allows it. Words like "take the lead," "type," and "demonstrate" still cannot be split arbitrarily. Sometimes, words are deliberately split to express humor, but quotation marks must be added. For example:
    (26) But in the past year, not only have I not "created" any "works," but I have also read few of the works that you have already published.
                              (Mao Dun)
    Section 4: "Synonyms"
    Some words look almost the same and are generally called "synonyms." In reality, there are no words with completely identical meanings and usages. The differences between them are often subtle, but this is precisely the proof of the richness and precision of our language. If we cherish our language, we should always pay attention to the meaning and usage of words, and when writing, we should seriously and carefully choose vocabulary. Below are some incorrect examples:
    Facts, situations. "Facts" refers to established events and cannot be expanded. What can be expanded is "situation."
    (1) Not understanding the situation and not asking us to clarify, deliberately expanding the facts. (Letter)
    Atmosphere, impression. "Atmosphere" is similar in meaning to "scene," such as saying "a tragic atmosphere." What can give people something is "impression," not "atmosphere."
    (2) Give people an atmosphere of the whole factory being invested in a production upsurge. (Book)
    Value, price. The meaning of "value" is more abstract. To say that something "has value" is equivalent to saying that it "is useful," "is important," or "is meaningful." For commodities, we only say "price" or "price," not "value."
    (3) And through the accountant's precise calculation, we determined the value of the promotion. (Manuscript)
    Order, sequence. "Order" refers to the tidiness or chaos of things, and has nothing to do with "priority." The following sentence should say "sequence."
    (4) The order of discussion is to start with heavy industry first, and then move on to general products. (Periodical)
    Opposition, contrast. "Opposition" means "hostile." The following sentence should use "contrast."
    (5) The two societies before and after liberation are exactly in opposition. (Work)
    Position, status. "Position" refers to a person's status, or the importance of things, such as saying "The Diary of a Madman occupies a particularly important position in the new literature since the May Fourth Movement." In this case, "status" can also be used. But the length of an article can only use "status," not "position."
    (6) Such a major issue only occupies five pages of position in the two compilations.
    Psychology, mood. "Psychology" refers to a person's thoughts. What is similar in meaning to "emotion" is "mood."
    (7) But the people's psychology appeared even heavier. (Periodical)
    Slogan, banner. What is shouted in the mouth is called a "slogan," and what is written on paper is called a "banner."
    (8) The venue was filled with slogans and charts related to completing the May production task and the April production results. (Book)
    Invention, discovery. Creating a new thing is called "invention." Some things originally existed, but everyone didn't know about them. Now they are found, which is called "discovery." The "invention" and "discovery" in the following two examples are used incorrectly and should be switched.
    (9) Becquerel invented the radioactivity of uranium, and the Curies invented radium ingots. (Book)
    (10) Our great motherland is the ancestor who discovered tea as a beverage. (Newspaper)
    Expectation, hope. "Expectation" is for others, such as "parents' expectations for their children" or "teachers' expectations for students." "Hope" can be for oneself or for others.
    (11) Every social worker... must also eagerly expect to undertake the tasks indicated by this article. (Periodical)
    Exchange, swap. "Exchange" is usually used with "experience." For "opinions," we only say "swap," not "exchange." The following sentence should be changed to "fully exchange opinions" or "fully negotiate."
    (12) After the conference fully exchanged, a total of 20 labor heroes, including Ren Qingmei, were elected. (Manuscript)
    Requisition, recruit. What is compulsory is called "requisition," which can be used for people or things. Generally, only the government has the right to requisition. Inviting staff is called "recruit."
    (13) The association now needs to requisition a secretary. Interested applicants can contact the association's office. (Document)
    Develop, increase. It is not necessarily wrong to say "the number develops" in the following sentence, but it is a bit of an overreaction. It is more customary to use "increase."
    (14) The transformation of comic strips has already attracted the attention of many people. The number of new comic strips published is gradually developing.
    Cater, greet. "Cater" has the meaning of "flattering" or "ingratiating." The following sentence should say "greet."
    (15) Transform yourself to greet this great era. (Work)
    Guarantee, assure. "Guarantee" means to maintain something that already exists so that it is not damaged. "Assure" means to guarantee the completion of a task or the realization of an ideal.
    (16) Guarantee that the Yellow River will not go wrong. (Periodical)
    (17) The economic mutual assistance of the six European countries of the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Poland, and Czechoslovakia also guarantees the wealth and prosperity of the people's democratic countries in Europe. (Periodical)
    Test, check. Using chemical methods to test is called "test." Otherwise, you can only say "check."
    (18) The "hemoglobin comparison" test has reached a severe state of anemia. (Book)
    Full, rich. "Full" is generally only used to describe things with a physical form. The following sentence should use "rich."
    (19) My life experience is richer than before. (Work)
    Serious, significant. "Serious" is a word with a bad meaning, such as saying "the problem is serious," "the condition is serious," or "the situation is serious." The good meaning word opposite it is "significant."
    (20) We know that improving labor productivity is of extremely significant significance to China's new economic construction. (Manuscript)
    Precise, certain. "Precise" means "accurate" or "appropriate," such as saying "comparing Chiang Kai-shek to a transportation captain is very precise." The following sentence should use "certain."
    (21) Be certain to achieve mutual assistance between urban and rural areas. (Periodical)
    Whole, entire. A whole thing can be said to be "whole," such as "the whole school" or "the whole of Korea." Things made up of many individuals should be said to be "entire," such as "entire inventory" or "entire firearms." If it is people, use "all," such as "all personnel."
    (22) In order to take care of the overall speed of mail delivery, direct delivery to the courtyard is not currently possible. (Letter)
    There are very many such words that have similar but not identical meanings. It is not possible to list them all here. Please pay attention to them at any time.

　　语法、修辞讲话（第二讲）
    第三段  词义
    吕叔湘　朱德熙
    说明词的意义和用法是辞典的事。如果有一本好辞典，我们这一段讲话就可以不必写，只要告诉大家去查辞典就行了。但是事实却不是这样。旧有的辞典多着重古语的解释，活在口头的现代词汇反而忽略了。新编的词典虽说注意现代词汇，但是解释也还不够精密，不能给我们很大的帮助。要掌握词的意义及用法，比较可靠的办法还是自己平时留意体会。下面我们举出用词应该注意的几件事，供大家参考。
    词义含褒贬。叙述同一件事，两个人的立场不同，说法也就可以不同。比如事实上我们是“支援”朝鲜人民反抗美帝国主义的侵略，美帝国主义者却硬说我们“侵略”朝鲜。在这里，两种立场相反的人用两个不同的词（“支援”和“侵略”）去说同一件事，用意就完全不同。有很多词看来很相像，可是有的带赞许的意味，有的带贬斥的意味，有的是中性的，界限分明，不容混淆。用错了就可能闹很大的笑话或者犯很大的错误。例如：
    （一）所以表现在作品里，歌颂的是人民，诽谤的是鬼子、汉奸和地主。（期）
    毫无根据地攻击别人叫做“诽谤”。我们攻击“鬼子、汉奸和地主”难道是没有根据的吗？把我们的攻击称为“诽谤”的不是别人，正是“鬼子、汉奸和地主”。跟“歌颂”对待的词是“诅咒”，但本句用“暴露”更妥贴些。
    （二）应该说，北大师生代表大会的收获，是超过最初的预期的，基本的症结就在于吸取了人民代表会议的经验，发挥高度民主，并正确地运用民主集中制来解决可能并必须解决的问题。（期）
    “症结”是一个文言词，原来是“病根”的意思。因此它只能用于含有贬斥之意的事例，如说“彼此不团结是工作做不好的症结所在”。本句应该用“关键”或“原因”（如果用“关键”，就不能再说“基本的”了）。
    （三）艾德礼和贝文之流还是假惺惺地说自己是英国劳动人民的朋友和庇护者。（期）
    “庇护”含有“偏袒”的意思。艾德礼和贝文是不会愚蠢到选择这样一个词来暴露自己的。这是把“庇护”与“保护”用混了。
    （四）我的能力虽差，但是只要努力学习，把持时间，仍是有希望的。（作）
    “把持”是带贬斥意味的词，如说“贪官污吏把持政治”。这里该用“把握”。
    大词小用。词的意义有大小、轻重之别，常见的毛病是“大词小用”，这等于用杀牛的刀杀鸡，有点不伦不类。
    （五）家庭制止我参加文工团。（作）
    （六）每天下午五点到六点是同学们运动的期间。（作）
    （七）他的父亲是民族资本家，所以我们结婚的局面很大。（信）
    （五）的“制止”该用“阻止”，（六）的“期间”该用“时间”，（七）的“局面”该用“场面”，都不必细说。
    单音词与双音词。一般地说，双音词的意义比跟它相当的单音词的意义抽象些。譬如“歌唱”并不等于“唱”，却与“歌颂”的意义近似，如说“歌唱毛泽东”。
    （八）我们进入大殿，迎面是一尊弥勒佛。（书）
    （九）从火线上下来，一连睡眠了十二小时。（期）
    （十）观望火车前进。（期）
    （八）该说“走进大殿”（比较“我军进入西藏”）；（九）该说“睡了十二小时”（比较“睡眠不足”）；（十）该说“看着火车前进”（比较“观望不前”）。
    指人与指物。我们只说“他对于新诗感觉兴趣”，不说“这首新诗很有兴趣”。因为“兴趣”是只能用于人的（人对事物发生“兴趣”），“趣味”是只用于物的（事物有“趣味”）。
    （十一）但全国估计有六千万至一万万亩土地受到严重的水旱虫雹等灾，使农业生产感到极大困难。（期）
    “农业生产”是没有感觉的，不会“感到”。应说“使农业生产遭遇极大困难”。
    主动与被动。关于被动式，在第三讲里要详细谈，这里只举一些由于用词引起的主动与被动的混淆。
    （十二）招展着毛泽东的旗帜，高唱着凯旋之歌。（稿）
    旗帜自己可以“招展”，我们却不能“招展”旗帜，应该说“挥舞”。
    （十三）我还清楚地记得那个极感动的场面。（期）
    “感动”的是人，不是“场面”，必须说“令人感动”。
    （十四）而像“芦柴棒”一般的偏能一天天的磨难下去（书）
    （十五）古老的亚洲，束缚着几千年的封建锁链的亚洲……（报）
    （十四）不是“芦柴棒”（人名）磨难别人，而是别人磨难“芦柴棒”，应说“一天天的受着磨难”。（十五）应改为“几千年来被封建锁链束缚着的亚洲”。
    （十六）编者在“前言”里说：“希望将来能集中较多的力量，出现一部比较完善的中国新民主主义革命史的教科书”。（报）
    如果说“希望将来出现一部……教科书”，那是通的。本句说“希望将来能集中较多力量……”，这里包含着一个没有说出的主语“我”或别人，那就不通了。因为只能说“一本书出现了”或是“出现了一本书”，却不能说“某某出现了一本书”。“出现”应改为“编写”。
    前后呼应的动词。
    有一些动词，如“使”“用”“供”“遭受”之类，往往跟别的动词连用（参阅第一讲第四段“复杂的谓语”节），单独用的时候另有近似而不相同的动词。
    （十七）把战争形势，解放军的生活，以及积极动员参军模范事实，使用画把它表现出来，（期）
    我们只说“用笔写字”“用嘴吃饭”，不说“使用笔写字”“使用嘴吃饭”。本句的“使用”跟“表现”不能呼应，应该改成“用”。
    （十八）并把实际情形介绍在下面供乘务员同志一个参考。（信）
    “供”必须跟别的动词连用，如说“供乘务员同志参考”。本句把“供”与名词（一个参考）搭配，前后就无法呼应了。这里该用“供给”。它可以跟名词配，如“供给乘务员同志一个参考”；也可以跟别的动词配，如“供给乘务员同志参考”。
    （十九）促进全世界一切爱好和平的国家与人民更加亲密的团结起来，（期）
    “促进”只能跟名词搭配，如“促进世界和平”“促进中苏人民的友谊”，本句应该用“促使”，才能跟动词“团结起来”呼应。
    否定与肯定。
    （二十）因为身体消瘦，体格不很好，所以对体育没有十二分的兴趣。（作）
    “十二分”只用在肯定语气的句子里。可以说“有十二分的兴趣”，不能说“没有十二分的兴趣”。本句应该改为“没有什么兴趣”，或“没有很大的兴趣”。
    （二一）因此，问题一度未能解决。（期）
    “一度”也只用在肯定语气的句子里，如说“他曾经一度失业”。本句应把“一度”改做“有一时期”。
    （二二）他把我带到这儿，又带到那儿，参加任何的活动。（作）
    我们只说“参加各种活动”，或说“任何活动也不参加”。（只有强调“任何”的意义的时候，才能用在肯定语气的句子，如“任何工作我都愿意做”。）
    分裂双音词。双音词虽然是由两个字拚成的，但是它跟单音词一样，只表示一个单纯的概念，不能硬把它们拆开。譬如“黄连”，并不是“黄”的“连”；“老婆”不是“老”的“婆”。现在常看见把双音词硬拆开的例子。最多的是动词，例如：
    （二三）我跟同学们游过好几次泳。（作）
    （二四）无论他演什么讲，总要插上一段“天道”与“人道”的大道理。（期）
    （二五）娃娃们跑来跑去，喊着妈，哄着笑，闹成一片。（书）
    “游泳”“演讲”“哄笑”原是联合式的词，却硬把它们拆开当做动宾式的词用，这在逻辑上是说不通的。如果是动宾式的词，就比较宜于分裂，例如“一个月理两次发，”“离了婚再结婚。”但是也要看习惯允许不允许，“带头”“打字”“示范”之类的词仍是不能任意拆开的。有时候故意把单词拆开，表示幽默，但必须加引号。例如：
    （二六）可是最近一年不但没有“创”过什么“作”，就连各位已经发表过的作品也读得不多。        
                              （茅盾）
    第四段  “同义词”
    有些词看上去差不多，一般称为“同义词”。实际上，意义和用法完全相同的词是没有的。其间的区别往往很细微，但这正是我们的语言的丰富与精密的证明。我们爱护我们的语言，就应该经常注意词的意义和用法，下笔的时候，要严肃地、细致地选择词汇。下面举一些错误的例子来看：
    事实、事态。“事实”指既成的事，不能扩大。能扩大的是“事态”。
    （一）既不了解情况，又不向我们问清，故意扩大事实。（信）
    气氛、印象。“气氛”跟“景象”的意思相近，如说“悲惨的气氛”。能够给人的是“印象”，不是“气氛”。
    （二）给人一个全厂都投入生产高潮的气氛。（书）
    价值、价格。“价值”的意思比较抽象，说一件事物“有价值”，等于说它“有用处”，“有重要性”，或“有意义”。对于商品，我们只说“价钱”或“价格”，不说“价值”。
    （三）并由会计的精确计算，使我们确定了推销的价值。（稿）
    秩序、次序。“秩序”是指事物的整齐或混乱说的，跟“先后”没有关系。下面这一句里应说“次序”。
    （四）讨论的秩序，是先从重工业起，然后及于一般的生产品。（期）
    对立、对比。“对立”是“敌对”的意思。下面这句里该用“对照”或“对比”。
    （五）解放前与解放后两个社会恰成对立。（作）
    位置、地位。“位置”指人的地位，或指事物的重要性，如说“狂人日记在五四以来的新文学中占有特别重要的位置”。在这种场合，也可以用“地位”。但文章篇幅的长短，只能用“地位”，不能用“位置”。
    （六）这样一个重大的问题，在两编内仅仅占了五页的位置。
    心理、心情。“心理”指人的想法，跟“情绪”的意思相近的是“心情”。
    （七）可是人民心理上却显现得更加沉重。（期）
    口号、标语。嘴里喊的叫“口号”，纸上写的叫“标语”。
    （八）会场上布满了有关完成五月生产任务和四月生产成绩的口号、图表，（书）
    发明、发现。创造一种新的事物叫“发明”。有些事物原先就存在，只是大家不知道，现在找出来了，叫“发现”。下面两个例子里的“发明”和“发现”用错了，应对调。
    （九）伯凯瑞发明铀的放射性，居里夫妇发明镭锭。（书）
    （十）我们伟大的祖国是发现以茶为饮料的始祖。（报）
    期望、希望。“期望”是对别人的，如“父母对子女的期望”，“教师对学生的期望”。“希望”可以对自己，也可以对别人。
    （十一）每一个社会工作者……也必然热烈的期望担负起这项条文所指示的任务的。（期）
    交流、交换。“交流”通常跟“经验”连用。对于“意见”，我们只说“交换”，不说“交流”。下句或改为“充分交换意见”，或改为“充分协商”。
    （十二）经过大会充分交流，共选出劳动英雄任清美……等二十名。（稿）
    征用、征聘。带强制性的叫“征用”，可以用于人，也可以用于物，一般只有政府有征用权。招请工作人员叫“征聘”。
    （十三）本会现需征用书记一名，有意应征者可来本会办公室接洽。（件）
    发展、增加。下句说“数量发展”，意思也不能算错，但是有点“小题大做”，用“增加”更合于习惯。
    （十四）连环图画的改造问题，已经引起了很多人的注意。新连环画的出版数量正在逐渐的发展。
