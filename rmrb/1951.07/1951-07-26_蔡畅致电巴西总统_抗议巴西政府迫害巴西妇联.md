　　Cai Chang Sends Telegram to Brazilian President
　　Protesting Brazilian Government's Persecution of the Brazilian Women's Federation
    [Xinhua News Agency, 24th] Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, sent a telegram to Getúlio Vargas, President of the Republic of Brazil, protesting the Brazilian government's persecution of peace-loving Brazilian women and their organization, the Brazilian Women's Federation. The telegram stated:
    Your fear of peace-loving Brazilian women and their organization, the Brazilian Women's Federation, as well as other peace-supporting Brazilian people, is demonstrated by your continuous persecution of them. This only shows the weakness of your power and your willingness to act as shameful servants of the American warmongers. We, the women of China, express our great anger and lodge a serious protest to you and the government authorities you lead. We demand that you immediately change these reactionary measures so that all Brazilian mothers, women, and all peace-loving people in Brazil can have full freedom to protect the safety of their children and express their desire for peace!

　  抗议巴西政府迫害巴西妇联
    【新华社二十四日讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会主席蔡畅致电巴西共和国总统格杜里阿·法加斯，抗议巴西政府迫害爱好和平的巴西妇女和她们的组织——巴西妇联。电文称：
    你们对热爱和平的巴西妇女和她们的组织巴西妇联，以及其他拥护和平的巴西人民，表现得如此畏惧而不断加以迫害，这只是说明你们力量的脆弱和甘心可耻地作美国战争贩子的仆从。我们中国妇女，怀着极大的愤怒向你及你领导的政府当局提出严重的抗议。并要求你们立即改变这些反动措施。让全巴西的母亲们、妇女们及全巴西爱好和平的人民，能得到保卫自己孩子们的安全与表达自己热爱和平的愿望的充分自由！
