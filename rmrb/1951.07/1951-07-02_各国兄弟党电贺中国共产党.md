The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia’s Congratulatory Telegram
Dear Comrades:
	On the glorious anniversary of the founding of your Party, we, on behalf of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and all the people of Czechoslovakia, extend to you the warmest fraternal congratulations.
	The Communist Party of China, drawing on the rich experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), under the long-tested leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, leader of the Communist Party of China, has won freedom for the Chinese people.
	Dear Comrades, we wish you more great achievements in the work of building a strong and happy People's Republic of China—a strong pillar of the world peace and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

The Bulgarian Communist Party's Congratulatory Telegram
To Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China:
	Dear Comrade Mao Zedong, on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, please allow me, on behalf of the entire Bulgarian Communist Party, the Central Committee, and the working people of our country, to extend warm greetings to you and, through you, to the Central Committee of the fraternal Communist Party of China and all members of the Communist Party of China.
	Under your wise and long-tested leadership, Comrade Mao Zedong, armed with the doctrines of the great Lenin and Stalin, relying on the world-historically significant experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), the heroic Communist Party of China led the forces of the Chinese people and led this struggle to victory in the struggle to overthrow the reactionary feudal aristocracy and eliminate the rule of the imperialists in vast and rich China. Now 475 million Chinese people, with the selfless help of the great Soviet Union, in cooperation with the people's democratic countries, and under the iron leadership of the Communist Party of China, are victoriously building their new free and happy life.
	The self-sacrificing participation of the Chinese People's Volunteers in the struggle in Korea against the American aggressors and executioners and in the struggle to defend China's independence and the freedom of the Korean people has consolidated the peace front and increasingly strengthened the fraternal feelings and love of the peace-loving peoples of all nationalities for the Communist Party of China and its leader Mao Zedong.
	The Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the working people of Bulgaria heartily congratulate the fraternal Communist Party of China on its new achievements in the struggle to consolidate the Chinese people's democracy and to enhance the power of the People's Republic of China in all aspects.
	Long live the glorious Communist Party of China and its Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong!
	Long live the eternal and indestructible friendship between the peoples of our two countries and the great Soviet Union!
	Long live the great Stalin, the leader and teacher of all progressive mankind!

	On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, the Vietnam Workers' Party extends warm greetings to the vanguard of the Chinese working class, the leader of the Chinese people, and the Communist Party of China, the torch that illuminates all the people of Asia who are fighting resolutely against the imperialist aggressors.
	The Vietnam Workers' Party, on behalf of the Vietnamese working class, the working people, and the entire nation, hails the great victories won by the Chinese people under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China.
	We are willing to work hard to learn the spirit of the Chinese working class and the Chinese people in their long and arduous struggle, to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, to strengthen the unity between the Chinese and Vietnamese nations, to defeat the American and French imperialists, to strive for national independence, to develop people's democracy, and to fight to defend world peace.

The German Communist Party's Congratulatory Telegram
To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China:
	The thirty-year history of the Communist Party of China is a history of the heroic and victorious liberation struggle of Chinese workers and peasants against the imperialists, headed by American imperialism, and the domestic feudal forces colluding with them. In the struggle in West Germany against the rearmament of Germany and for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany in 1951, "Friendship with the great Chinese people" is also one of the main slogans. On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the Communist Party of China, we pay tribute to the political party of the Chinese people—the Communist Party of China and its wise leader Mao Zedong.
