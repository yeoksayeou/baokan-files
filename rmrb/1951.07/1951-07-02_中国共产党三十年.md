　　Thirty Years of the Chinese Communist Party
    Huang Yanpei
       I
    Great! Great!
    The sunshine universally shines in the homes of the people.
    Sweetly,
    Warmly,
    Like falling together into the embrace of a mother.
    Is it still worth recalling?
    Last night,
    The merciless wind blew fiercely,
    The rain lashed violently,
    Pitiful and lovable this tender sprout of democracy.
          II
    Truly fortunate,
    What line,
    What line;
    Some in the middle perhaps believed that doing it this way was an effective contribution.
    Failed,
    Failed,
    But accumulated a lot of experience,
    Finally, truth was discovered by the philosophers.
    Truth was discovered by the philosophers long ago,
    But unfortunately, the conditions for it to mature were not yet present.
    Several important junctures in the past,
    Are all worth greatly commemorating today.
    Most worth commemorating,
    Is the Zunyi Conference of 1935,
    Which only then brought about a correct fundamental change in thought and leadership.
    Things were already very urgent,
    Fortunate! Fortunate!
    Finally, unanimous awareness was achieved,
    Unanimous support,
    Proving the universality of truth.
          III
    The Party,
    Ten years,
    Twenty years,
    Thirty years,
    The number of people, increasing year by year,
    The strength, becoming stronger year by year.
    These are natural.
    What is rare, is—
    The quality, becoming better year by year.
    This is not accidental.
    To the people, closely connect with the masses,
    To oneself, self-criticism;
    These weapons,
    Will release boundless light from the people.
    Only flowing water is not stagnant,
    The facts have already proven,
    It is not an exaggeration.
    Today, I recognize,
    That at the time, during that conversation in Yan'an,
    My estimation was too low;
    The answer received was correct,
    "Only when everyone rises to take responsibility,
    Will this good government last long."
          IV
    A very precious discovery,
    Is the People's Democratic United Front.
    The leadership of the working class has been resolved,
    The worker-peasant alliance has been resolved,
    Discovering it,
    Enabled the Party and the revolution to develop more rapidly.
    A point in the middle,
    The Chinese bourgeoisie,
    Has two different groups,
    One of them,
    The national bourgeoisie,
    Can be won over,
    Only with certain conditions,
    Cannot be regarded as a dangerous enemy.
    These have their basic viewpoints,
    "Marxism-Leninism has been Sinicized."
    Please read the philosophical article that is both profound and accessible,
    On Practice.
           V
    Endless torture,
    The "People's Republic of China,"
    What was it forged from?
    The blood of millions upon millions of people's heroes.
    From the first to the fifth encirclement campaigns,
    The waters of the Dadu River,
    The snows of the grasslands,
    What is deeply imprinted on them?
    The footsteps of the 25,000-li Long March.
    Furthermore, having gone through eight years of struggle against the domestic reactionaries while resisting Japan,
    Everything, everything,
    Cannot be remembered clearly,
    Cannot be written completely,
    "Even if all the trees in the world were turned into pens"!
           VI
    "Red flags wave in the west wind,"
    People have been awakened,
    From long-term slumber;
    Have been inspired,
    The large and small revolutionary movements of different nationalities surrounding it.
    It is an incomparably powerful people's democratic fortress,
    Is an incomparably elite people's revolutionary vanguard.
    Resisting America, Aiding Korea, is its victorious and heroic attack on imperialism.
    The reason it succeeded,
    Is that it infiltrated political thought into the army composed mainly of workers and peasants.
    It has mastered New Democracy,
    It has developed the various styles of work under New Democracy.
    Great! Great!
    Every corner of the world is singing:
    "China has produced a Mao Zedong!"
      July 1, 1951

### 中国共产党三十年

　　中国共产党三十年
    黄炎培
       一
    伟大！伟大！
    阳光普遍地照耀在百姓之家。
    甜蜜蜜地，
    暖和和地，
    像一齐倒在母亲之怀。
    还堪回忆么？
    昨夜，
    无情的风猛吹着，
    雨猛打着，
    可怜而又可爱的这民主的嫩芽。
          二
    真欣幸的，
    什么路线，
    什么路线；
    中间有些，也许认为这样地干，是有效的贡献。
    失败了，
    失败了，
    倒积下了不少经验，
    到底真理给哲人发现。
    真理是早给哲人发见了，
    无奈一时还没有成熟的条件。
    过去若干重要关头，
    到今朝都值得大大地纪念。
    最值得纪念的，
    是一九三五年遵义一场会议，
    才在思想上在领导上得到了正确的基本的改变。
    事情已经很急迫了，
    欣幸！欣幸！
    终于获得一致的觉悟，
    一致的拥护，
    证明了真理普遍。
          三
    党，
    十年，
    二十年，
    三十年，
    人，一年比一年加多，
    力，一年比一年加强。
    这些是自然的了。
    难得的，是——
    质，一年比一年加良。
    这不是偶然的。
    对人要和大众紧密联系，
    对己要自我批评；
    这些武器，
    会从人群中放出万丈光芒。
    只有流水是不腐的，
    事实已经证明，
    并不是夸张。
    到今天，我识得了，
    当时延安一席谈，
    我估计过低了；
    所得到的答复，是正确的，
    “只有人人起来负责，
    这好政府才会久长。”
          四
    很宝贵的发现，
    是人民民主统一战线。
    工人阶级领导问题解决了，
    工农联盟问题解决了，
    发现了它，
    使党和革命更得到迅速的发展。
    中间的一点，
    中国资产阶级，
    有两个不同的集团，
    其中一个，
    民族资产阶级，
    是可以争取的，
    只须有一定的条件，
    不能认做敌人危险。
    这些有他的基本观点，
    “马列主义中国化了。”
    请读又深刻又通俗的哲学文章，
    论实践。
           五
    说不尽的折磨，
    “中华人民共和国”，
    用什么铸成的？
    是千千万万人民英雄们之血。
    从第一次到第五次围攻，
    大渡河的水，
    草原的雪，
    深深地印在上边的是什么？
    二万五千里长征脚迹。
    更经过了八年间一面和国内反动派斗争，一面抗日，
    一切的一切，
    记也记不清，
    写也写不完，
    “即使把天下的树都变成笔”！
           六
    “红旗漫卷西风”，
    人们被叫醒了，
    在长期沉睡中；
    被鼓舞了，
    环绕在它周围的大大小小不同民族的革命运动。
    它是强大无比的人民民主堡垒，
    是精锐无比的人民革命先锋。
    抗美援朝，是它向帝国主义胜利地英勇地进攻。
    它之所以成功，
    它把政治思想渗透在以工农为主要成分的军队中。
    它掌握了新民主主义，
    它发挥了新民主主义下的种种作风。
    伟大！伟大！
    世界每一个角落在歌颂着：
    “中国出了一个毛泽东！”
      一九五一年七月一日
