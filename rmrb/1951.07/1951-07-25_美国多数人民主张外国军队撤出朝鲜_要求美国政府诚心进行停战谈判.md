　　Majority of Americans Advocate for Withdrawal of Foreign Troops from Korea
　　Demand U.S. Government Negotiate Ceasefire with Sincerity
    Xinhua News Agency, July 24th - The fact that the majority of Americans advocate for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea is also reflected in the results of a Gallup poll. The poll, released on the 23rd, showed that 54 percent of those surveyed favored the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, 35 percent opposed it, and 11 percent had no opinion.
    Xinhua News Agency, July 24th - According to a Dentsu news agency report from New York on the 23rd: Americans holding various viewpoints unanimously demanded last week that the U.S. government conduct Korean armistice negotiations with sincerity. The National Labor Conference for Peace called on American labor to remain vigilant against attempts to undermine the Korean peace talks. Conference Chairman Sharal telegraphed one hundred national union leaders who were elected to the National Labor Peace Committee at the Chicago Peace Conference, saying, "We must demand assurance that there is no conspiracy to sabotage the ceasefire negotiations." In a telegram to Truman, he insisted that nothing should hinder "swift, uninterrupted, and successful negotiations to implement a ceasefire, withdraw all foreign troops, and hold negotiations to resolve all disputed issues."
    Several peace groups in New York announced that they will visit the U.S. and other national delegations to the United Nations tomorrow to urge the swift completion of the Korean peace talks and to hold a great power conference to peacefully resolve all other outstanding issues. The groups participating in the visit will include the American Women's Association for Peace, the New York Labor Peace Conference, and veterans', youth, and black peace groups.
