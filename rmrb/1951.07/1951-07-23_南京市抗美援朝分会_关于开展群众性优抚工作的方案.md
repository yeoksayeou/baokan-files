Editor's Note: The "Implementation Plan for Carrying Out Mass Preferential Treatment Work" passed by the Nanjing Anti-U.S. and Aid-Korea Representative Conference correctly embodies the spirit of the China People's Anti-U.S. and Aid-Korea Headquarters' call to earnestly do a good job in preferential treatment work. The main advantage of the plan is that, based on the urban situation, it determines to mobilize people from all walks of life to organize preferential treatment committees from top to bottom and carry out work under the leadership of the local Anti-U.S. and Aid-Korea branches. This can ensure the reliable development of mass preferential treatment work and give the implementation of the people's government's preferential treatment policies a broad mass base. The plan proposes to give timely and appropriate preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers in terms of politics, material goods, and spirit, and stipulates many specific measures for this purpose. If these measures can be conscientiously implemented, preferential treatment work will achieve new development. We hope that anti-U.S. and aid-Korea branches and relevant departments in various regions will formulate methods for conscientiously carrying out preferential treatment work like those in Nanjing, based on the specific conditions of their localities, so that the national preferential treatment work can be done better.

The ability of the people of Nanjing to gain liberation, enjoy a peaceful and prosperous life, and engage in peaceful construction is mainly due to the heroic struggle of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the People's Public Security Forces, and especially the Chinese People's Volunteers. Therefore, truly taking care of the lives of the families of martyrs and soldiers and striving to do a good job in preferential treatment work has become one of the three central tasks of the current anti-U.S. and aid-Korea movement and has become the glorious task of the people of Nanjing. In response to the anti-U.S. and aid-Korea Headquarters' "June 1st" call and to implement the East China Anti-U.S. and Aid-Korea General Branch's instructions on earnestly and regularly doing a good job in preferential treatment and pensions for the families of martyrs and soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers, and based on the "Provisional Regulations on Preferential Treatment for Families of Revolutionary Martyrs and Families of Revolutionary Soldiers" promulgated by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government on December 11, 1950, and in conjunction with the specific conditions of this city, this plan is specially formulated to call on the people of the city to take active action based on this plan and launch preferential treatment work.
