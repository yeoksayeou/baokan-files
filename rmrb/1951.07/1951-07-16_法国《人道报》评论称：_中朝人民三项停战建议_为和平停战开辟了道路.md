Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 14th.  "L'Humanité" published an editorial on the 12th, stating that anyone with honesty, after even a cursory study of the proposals put forward by the Korean and Chinese people, would recognize that this proposal contains the conditions for a swift armistice, an armistice that opens the way for peace.

The editorial said: "If the United States insists on playing tricks that no one understands, they are simply proving that they are only using the pretense of accepting negotiations as an opportunity to whitewash themselves in front of the people, with the intention of sabotaging the negotiations and ultimately shifting the responsibility for the failure of the negotiations onto the other party."

The editorial continued: "The first condition—an immediate cessation of hostilities—is obviously a guarantee of the sincerity of both parties and a guarantee of the necessary relaxation of tensions between the two sides."

Speaking of the barbaric bombing carried out by the United States after agreeing to negotiate, the editorial said: "Now the responsibility is very clear: the Korean and Chinese people advocate an immediate cessation of hostilities. But in the process of negotiations, the United States hopes to continue fighting to the end."

The editorial further stated: The first condition put forward by the Korean and Chinese people stems from a deep concern for humanity and a genuine abhorrence of war and the disasters it causes. The second condition is even a matter of simple common sense. Both sides withdrawing ten kilometers from the 38th parallel is, in effect, the only way to avoid future accidents. Some Americans object, arguing that the 38th parallel is not a "strategic line," which shows that they inwardly believe that it is possible to re-launch the war. They are not thinking about peace, but about future strongholds for launching attacks. From this, it can be seen that only the Korean proposal can guarantee a swift armistice in the simplest way.

The editorial pointed out: The rapid withdrawal of foreign troops is a necessary condition for a true armistice and a peaceful settlement. But "Washington says this is a political condition. From this question, it can be known who wants a political solution—a peaceful solution, and who wants a 'military' solution—war."

### 法国《人道报》评论称：  中朝人民三项停战建议  为和平停战开辟了道路

　　法国《人道报》评论称：
    中朝人民三项停战建议
    为和平停战开辟了道路
    【新华社布拉格十四日电】《人道报》十二日发表社论说：每一个诚实的人只要粗略地研究一下朝鲜和中国人民提出的建议，就会承认这个建议中有着迅速停战的条件。这种停战，是为和平开辟道路的停战。
    社论说：“如果美国一定要玩弄天晓得的圈套，他们正好证明他们只不过用假意接受谈判的办法找机会在人民面前替自己搽粉，其用意只是破坏谈判，最后把谈判失败的责任推到对方肩上。”
    社论又说：“第一个条件——立即停止战斗——显然是双方的诚意的保证和使双方之间的紧张状态得到必要的缓和的保证。”
    社论在说到美国在同意谈判以后进行野蛮的轰炸时说：“现在责任是很明白的：朝鲜人民和中国人民主张立即停止战斗。而在进行谈判的过程中，美国却希望继续作战到底。”
    社论进一步说：朝鲜人民和中国人民提出的第一个条件，是出于对人类的深切关怀和对战争及其所引起的灾难的真正痛恨。第二个条件更是一个简单的常识问题。双方从三八线撤离十公里，实际上这是避免以后的事故的唯一办法。有些美国人提出反对的理由说三八线不是一条“战略界线”，这正表示他们承认他们内心认为有可能重新发动战争。他们不在想和平，而在想将来发动进攻的据点。由此可见，显然只有朝鲜的建议才能保证用最简单的办法迅速停战。
    社论指出：尽快撤退外国军队，乃是真正的停战和和平解决的必要条件。但是“华盛顿说这是政治条件。从这个问题正可以知道是谁希望政治解决——和平解决，谁希望‘军事’解决——战争。”
