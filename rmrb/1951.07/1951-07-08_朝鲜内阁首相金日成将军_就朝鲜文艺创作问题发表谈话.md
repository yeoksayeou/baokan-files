Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang: Premier Kim Il-sung of the Cabinet of North Korea recently met with prominent writers and artists from North Korea and delivered the following talk on literary and artistic creation:

　　Today, as our Korean people are engaged in a sacred Fatherland Liberation War to defend the independence and freedom of our country and resist the brutal American imperialist aggressors, the mission and tasks of our Korean writers and artists are very important. Our writers and artists are engineers of human spiritual life. In their works, they should not only vividly express the lofty patriotism and firm fighting spirit of our people, as well as their firm determination and confidence in winning the final victory; but also, they should make their works powerful and sharp weapons in the hands of our people in struggle, inspiring and propelling the entire people towards the path of final victory.

　　Our Korean writers and artists have not yet achieved the creative results that the country and the people demand. Our writers and artists have not been able to express the thoughts, feelings, and work of the people at a high artistic level; they have failed to keep up with reality to point out the direction the people should take; on the contrary, they have fallen behind reality and failed to reflect reality itself in their artistic works. Our writers and artists have not been able to clearly depict the figures who are creating a new life with high imagery and artistry; they have failed to raise the role of artistic works to the level of becoming textbooks for life. Our writers and artists have not yet been able to thoroughly describe the creative labor and struggle of the people in all areas of people's lives; they have failed to express well the criticism and hatred of the old and the love of the new. During the Fatherland War, although our writers and artists created many literary and artistic works, in terms of their ideological content and artistry, they have not been able to create artistic works of a high level worthy of our heroic people.

　　I would like to take this opportunity of today's simple gathering to talk to you writers and artists about several important issues that have not been well expressed in our Korean literary and artistic works.

　　Our Korean writers and artists, in their works, should write about the lofty patriotism that our people have displayed and are displaying in the past and present. Only by having a good understanding of the past of our country, understanding the excellent traditions, culture, and customs of our nation, can patriotism be generated. Patriotism is by no means derived from any abstract concept; but is expressed from the love of one's own country's land, history, and culture, the nostalgia for one's hometown, the remembrance and feelings for the people of one's hometown, and the love for one's parents, wife, and children. Patriotism lives concretely in people's emotions, and its expression can be seen concretely. Therefore, when our writers and artists express the patriotism of the Korean people, they should never put forward a series of abstract slogans; but should write about the most concrete, image-filled emotions and characters, and thoughts. Only in this way can the patriotism expressed in the works conform to reality and have concreteness and authenticity. Indeed, through a long history, our Korean people have never displayed patriotism as they are doing today in the great Fatherland Liberation War. Our people, on the front lines and in the rear, in cities and villages, are displaying a level of patriotism that was unimaginable in the past. This fact shows that our people's understanding of their historical mission and the fate of their country has been raised higher than at any time. This also shows that our people have broken away from the narrow limitations of nationalism and are standing on the position of world history, profoundly recognizing their situation and role. In other words, it shows that the Korean people of today are not only not the Korean people who were under the rule of Japanese imperialism in the past; but are also not the Korean people before the war. This historical transformation that has taken place in our national history should be written in literary and artistic works. Our writers and artists must express patriotism and our nation's high degree of self-confidence in their works. Only after eliminating all the old remnants and bad habits of obsolete xenophobia can there be true love for the country and the people. Therefore, there must be no unfounded sense of national superiority or contempt for other nations. Undoubtedly, it is necessary to instill a high degree of internationalism.

　　Our writers and artists, in their works, must express and depict the heroism and tenacity of our People's Army. Although our People's Army is young, it has accumulated an astonishing amount of combat experience. During the first counter-offensive, our People's Army learned offensive warfare of annihilating the enemy and advancing in battle; during the strategic retreat, they learned how to rally their troops in the face of a powerful enemy and how to prepare combat forces to launch a new offensive. Therefore, our People's Army has been completely transformed into a modern army in tactics.

　　The heroism of our People's Army is not a heroic spirit displayed by any individual, but a mass heroism. Therefore, it is of great significance. The heroism and tenacity displayed by our officers and soldiers in battle illustrate the fact that our soldiers are not only ideologically and politically prepared, but also recognize the sacred tasks they bear before the country and the people and have well fulfilled their tasks.

　　Our writers and artists must depict many heroes of the Republic in their works. As soon as they talk about writing heroes, some writers and artists try to find novel facts and legendary extraordinary people. This attitude towards creation cannot correctly depict our heroes. Our heroes are yesterday's workers, peasants, staff, students, or their children. If they can directly write about their rich emotions and personalities, as well as their thoughts and beliefs, then that is today's hero of our Republic. This should also not start from abstract concepts, but from the most concrete reality. Our writers and artists must not forget that abstract things are stale in art. However, regrettably, there is still the fact that some writers clearly do not know the hero's own deeds, but only want to describe the hero after hearing a very short summary. This is not only an insult to the hero himself; but also an unforgivable crime against our readers. Our writers must never forget for a moment that their works will be passed on to the people, and they must not forget that the people do not read artistic works as a pastime to replace a nap, but to gain knowledge, improve their fighting spirit, and to obtain weapons to fight the enemy from works that express themselves. Do not forget the fact that our people today have such a serious attitude. Along with the heroic spirit of our army, there is also the fierce struggle and unparalleled heroism of our people in the rear and in the areas temporarily occupied by the enemy, which should also be well written in our literary and artistic works.

　　Our writers and artists must create artistic works that strengthen the people's and army's confidence in victory. As is well known, confidence in victory is a great force that can only be possessed when one has a good understanding of one's own strength and situation, and a good assessment of the enemy's situation and strength. In other words, when our writers and artists describe our people and army officers and soldiers, they must write about the high ideological foundation and national standpoint and understanding they possess. They must depict figures who correctly estimate their own strength based on the current situation; at the same time, they must write about the enemy's fatal weaknesses and situation.

　　Here, it is necessary to write from a highly artistic point of view the fact that the war we are waging now is a just war, a war for the happiness of the country and future generations.

　　Our writers and artists, in their works, should correctly express their hatred for the enemy. In this issue, the question arises of how to describe the enemy. It is certainly correct for our writers to portray the American imperialist aggressors as cunning; however, they often forget that American imperialists are not only cunning, but also the most fierce, ugliest, and barbaric. What kind of cunning have the American imperialists, who have indiscriminately bombed our cities and villages into ashes and massacred our people in large numbers, displayed? The American imperialists in Korea have exposed their incomparably fierce inhumanity and unprecedented cruelty and barbarism, and they are proud of this behavior in order to let people know their ambition to conquer the people of the world. The American missionaries who came to Korea in the past holding crosses and shouting "God" are now holding carbines instead of crosses, tying dozens of pregnant women together and shooting them, and running over children with tanks. The "gentlemen" of Wall Street, who flaunt the "Statue of Liberty" to the world, are today stripping Korean girls of their clothes, stuffing them into cars and tanks, and carrying out unimaginable insults and atrocities. The people of the world must know the atrocities of American imperialism. People must be awakened to forever be angry and curse the crimes of American imperialists against humanity and the shame against future generations. However, our writers must not forget that only by seeing the enemy's atrocities is not enough to create art, and is not enough to further strengthen the people's hatred of the enemy. Any artistic work can only create realistic artistic works by eliminating naturalistic elements. Regrettably, there is still a strong naturalistic approach in the works of our writers and artists. If we do not carry out a thorough struggle against this tendency, then our literature and art cannot develop in the right direction. Writers and artists must expose the ugly faces of the enemies of our Korean people, and expose the American imperialist robbers and the Lee Seung-man traitorous bandits.

　　Our writers and artists should bear in mind that the creator of great art is the people. Excellent artistic works cannot but be loved by the people. It cannot become an excellent artistic work if it is not understood by the people or if it does not have the people's evaluation.

　　Our writers must study and widely utilize people's literature, especially folk songs, classical literature, etc. However, it cannot be said that all folk songs are good, nor can it be said that classical literature can be fully utilized. But some artists believe that only by preserving the past folk songs as they are is it truly inheriting national culture. This tendency forgets the basic path of developing our national culture. In folk songs, music, dance, and other departments, we must preserve the excellent characteristics inherent in our nation; at the same time, we must create new rhythms, new melodies, and new movements that meet the requirements of the new life. Our writers and artists must use a critical approach to develop the art possessed by our people, eliminate unscientific and vulgar art, and bring art to a high level. At the same time, our writers and artists must use many artistic forms possessed by the people with new and appropriate content.

　　Our writers and artists, in their creative work, must vigorously launch criticism and self-criticism. After liberation, works with formalist tendencies and works with cosmopolitan tendencies have appeared in our literary and artistic works. Nevertheless, our literary and critical circles have been extremely backward. There is no doubt that there will be no development in creative work without sound criticism. However, it must be remembered that the focus of all criticism should not be on "striking down," but should put the basic spirit on achieving greater results and taking the correct path. However, regrettably, in the past there has been a tendency to not only not correct the mistakes of writers and works, but to "overthrow" writers and works. This kind of "criticism" is not the literary criticism we require. In addition to the most thorough and calm criticism, there should also be literary criticism based on a spirit of thorough fairness and mutual assistance, so as to quickly and timely correct the mistakes made by writers, so that they can develop in the right direction and achieve greater results. It is not terrible to make mistakes. There will be mistakes in creative work. The most terrible thing is not to ask about mistakes and not to correct them in time. At the same time, in the literary and artistic circles, we must carry out a relentless struggle against various sectarian actions and tendencies.

　　Our writers and artists should absorb a large amount of the world's advanced culture, especially the culture of the various people's democratic countries headed by the great Soviet Union. Our Korean literature and art not only have many backward departments so far, but also have many aspects that need to be corrected in the basic aspects of literary and artistic development. Our writers and artists should adopt a very solemn and serious learner's attitude towards advanced literature and art. We should remember that only by learning from the advanced culture and art of the Soviet Union can we build a splendid national culture. When absorbing the culture of the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries, the most noteworthy thing is the spirit of internationalism possessed by the culture of these countries. Our writers and artists must create artistic works with a high degree of internationalism. Our literature and art have not yet been able to well describe the fortress of world peace – the Soviet Union, the great liberator of my country – the Soviet Union, the eternal friend of our people – the Soviet people, and have not been able to well describe the image of the great comrades-in-arms of the Chinese People's Volunteers who are gloriously fighting side by side with us in our people's sacred war against the American imperialist beasts, and have not been able to well write about the situation of the people of various people's democratic countries who are giving our people warm fraternal support and assistance. Our Korean writers and artists should express this scene with a high degree of artistry, so that it becomes a serious warning to the aggressors and warmongers, making them tremble; let the peace-loving people of the world enthusiastically regard it as a song of friendship, as a song of the people for freedom and happiness.

　　Respectable writers and artists! The Korean people have put forward important tasks to you. You should introduce our people's heroic struggle and brilliant victory to the people of the world, and should pass it on to our future generations. Our people believe that you will surely be able to gloriously complete this sacred task. Therefore, we are paying unprecedented attention to your creative activities. The art required by the heroic people should be heroic. The level of art required by the people standing on the world stage should be raised to the world level. The people ask you to devote all your efforts to creating that kind of literature and art. Everyone! You are the creators of the great weapon of literature and art required by our people in struggle. Therefore, you are fighters. If you are not a writer who loves the country, how can you create patriotic works? How can an artist who is not liked by the people create art for the people? The great writers and artists of the world are all great patriots, great fighters for the happiness of the people. Therefore, they are forever loved and respected by all people and praised by mankind. Today, our Korean people are advancing towards the final victory of the Fatherland War, regardless of all suffering and trials. I, together with all the people, believe that you—the outstanding sons and daughters of our heroic people—will also contribute to the world with great artistic works before the country and the people; and will be able to clearly and gloriously convey our heroic era to future generations.

　　朝鲜内阁首相金日成将军
    就朝鲜文艺创作问题发表谈话
    【新华社讯】平壤消息：朝鲜内阁首相金日成将军最近接见了朝鲜的著名作家和艺术家，就文艺创作问题发表谈话如下：
    今天在我们朝鲜人民为保卫祖国的独立自由、反抗野兽般的美帝国主义侵略者而进行着神圣的祖国解放战争的时候，我们朝鲜的作家、艺术家的使命和任务是很重大的。我们的作家、艺术家是人类精神生活的技师，在自己的作品里，不但应该鲜明地表现出我们人民所具有的崇高的爱国主义精神和坚决的斗志，以及争取最后胜利的坚强决心和信心；而且，应该使自己的作品在我们斗争中的人民的手中，成为强有力的锐利武器，鼓舞和推动全体人民走向最后胜利的道路。
    我们朝鲜的作家、艺术家尚未取得祖国与人民所要求的那种创作的成果。我们的作家、艺术家还未能在很高的艺术水平上，表现出人民的思想、感情及工作；未能赶上现实，来指出人民应走的方向；相反地，却落在现实的后面，未能把现实本身反映到艺术作品里。我们的作家、艺术家还未能明确地以高度的形象和艺术来描写创造着新生活的人物；未能将艺术作品的作用，提高到成为生活教科书的水平。我们的作家和艺术家到现在还没有能通过人民生活的各个领域，来很好地描写人民创造性的劳动和斗争；未能很好地表现出对旧事物的批判、憎恶和对新事物的爱好。在祖国战争期间，我们的作家和艺术家虽然创作了许多文艺作品，但就其思想内容和艺术性来说，还没有能创作出我们英雄的人民所应有的高度水平的艺术作品。
    我想利用今天简单聚会的机会，与各位作家、艺术家就我们朝鲜的文艺作品尚未很好地表现出来的几个重要问题谈一谈。
    我们朝鲜作家、艺术家在自己的作品里，应该写出我们人民在过去和现在所发挥了和正在发挥着的崇高爱国主义精神。只有很好地了解自己祖国的过去，了解自己民族所具有的优秀传统、文化及风俗习惯，方能产生爱国主义精神。爱国主义精神绝不是从任何抽象概念里得来的；而是从对自己祖国土地、历史和文化的热爱、对自己故乡的留恋、对故乡人民的怀念和情感、对父母妻子的爱情里表现出来的。爱国主义精神具体地活在人们的情感中，可以具体地看到它的表现。因此，我们的作家、艺术家在表现朝鲜人民的爱国主义精神时，绝不是要提出一系列的抽象口号；而是要写出最具体的、形象的感情和人物、思想。只有这样表现在作品里的爱国主义精神，才能符合现实而有具体性和真实性。的确，我们朝鲜人民通过悠久的历史，从没有象今天在伟大的祖国解放战争中这样发挥过爱国主义精神。我们人民在前线和后方，在城市和乡村，发挥着过去所想像不到的高度的爱国主义精神。这一事实说明：我们人民对自己的历史使命和自己祖国命运的认识，比任何时期都更加提高了。这又说明我们人民摆脱了狭隘的民族的局限性，而站在世界历史的立场上，深刻地认识了自己的处境和作用。换句话说，它说明今天的朝鲜人民不但不是过去受日本帝国主义统治时代的朝鲜人民了；而且也不是战前的朝鲜人民了。在我们民族史上所发生的这种历史性的转变，应该写在文学、艺术作品里。我们的作家、艺术家必须把爱国主义精神和我们民族的高度的自信心表现在作品里。只有在肃清陈腐的排外主义的一切旧的残余和恶习后，方能对祖国和人民有真正的热爱。所以，在这里是绝不能容许毫无根据的民族主义的优越感或对其他民族的鄙视存在。无疑地，需要贯输有高度的国际主义精神。
    我们的作家和艺术家在自己的作品里，必须表现和描写我们人民军的英雄主义和顽强性。我们的人民军虽然年青，但它已积累了惊人的许多战斗经验。在第一次反攻时期，我们人民军在战斗中学习了歼敌前进的攻击战；在战略撤退时期，学会了在强大的敌人面前怎样收拾自己的队伍，怎样来准备战斗力量，以发动新的攻势。因此，我们人民军在战术上完全变成了现代化的军队。
    我们人民军的英雄主义，不是任何个人发挥的英雄精神，而是完全具有群众性的英雄主义。因此，也就具有重大意义。我们官兵在战斗中所发挥的英雄主义与顽强性说明了这样的事实：我们的战士不仅在思想上、政治上有所准备，而且认识到自己在祖国与人民面前所负有的神圣任务和很好地执行了任务。
    我们的作家和艺术家们在作品里必须描写许多共和国的英雄。一说写英雄，就有些作家和艺术家想努力寻找新奇的事实和传说性的非凡的人。这种创作的态度是不能正确地描写我们的英雄的。我们的英雄是昨天的工人、农民、职员、学生，或是他们的子弟。要是能够直接写出他们丰富的感情和性格以及他们所具有的思想与信心的话，那就是今天我们共和国的英雄。这也不应该从抽象的概念出发，而应该从最具体的现实出发。我们的作家、艺术家不要忘记，抽象的东西在艺术上是陈腐的。但是，遗憾的是还存在着这样的事实，即某些作家明明不知道英雄本身的事迹，只是听了极短的略历就要描写英雄。这不仅是对英雄本人的侮辱；而且是对我们读者的不能容许的罪过。我们的作家一时一刻也不要忘记自己的作品要传到人民手里这件事，并且不要忘记人民不是把艺术作品当作代替午觉的消遣品来阅读，而是为了从中得到知识、提高斗争情绪，是为了从表现自己的作品中取得对敌斗争的武器而阅读的。不要忘记今天我们人民所具有的那种严肃态度的事实。和我们军队的英勇精神同时存在的，还有我们人民在后方和敌人暂时侵占的地区所进行的激烈的斗争与勇敢无比的英雄主义，这也应该好好地写在我们的文艺作品里。
    我们的作家、艺术家必须创作足以加强人民和军队的胜利信心的艺术作品。如所周知，胜利信心是只有在很好地了解自己的力量和形势，很好地估计敌人的处境和力量的时候，才能具有的一种伟大力量。换句话说，我们的作家、艺术家在描写我们人民和军队官兵的时候，必须写出他们所具有的高度的思想基础和国家的立场与认识。要描写根据目前的形势而正确地估计自己力量的人物；同时要写出敌人的致命弱点和处境。
    在这里，必须以高度的艺术观点来写出现在我们所进行的战争是正义的战争，是为祖国的幸福与后代的战争的事实。
    我们的作家、艺术家在自己的作品中，应该正确地表现出对敌人的憎恨心。在这一问题上就出现了怎样描写敌人的问题。我们的作家把美帝国主义侵略者描写成狡猾之徒，这当然是正确的；但是，常有忘却美帝国主义者不仅狡猾，而且是最凶狠、最丑恶的野蛮人的事实。把我们的城市和乡村滥炸成灰烬、大批地屠杀着我们人民的美帝国主义者，表现了怎么样的狡猾性呢？美帝国主义者在朝鲜暴露了自己凶恶无比的非人性和史无前例的残忍性与野蛮性，而他们却以这种行为为荣，以便让人们知道他们企图征服世界人民的野心。过去拿着十字架来到朝鲜高喊“上帝”的美国传教师们，今天拿着的不是十字架，而是拿起卡宾枪，把数十名怀孕的妇人绑在一起枪毙，用坦克轧死小孩。向全世界夸示“自由女神”的华尔街的“绅士”们，今天剥光朝鲜姑娘的衣服，装在汽车和坦克里，实施着人们难以想像的凌辱和暴行。世界人民必须知道美帝国主义的暴行。必须唤起人们，为美帝国主义者对人类的罪恶和对后代的耻辱而永远愤怒和诅咒。但是，我们的作家不要忘记只凭看到的敌人暴行是不能成为艺术的，是不能够进一步加强人民的敌忾的。任何一个艺术作品只有肃清自然主义的要素，方才能创作出现实主义的艺术作品。遗憾的是：在我们的作家、艺术家的作品里，还存在着浓厚的那种自然主义的手法。要不和这种倾向进行彻底的斗争，那么我们的文学、艺术就不能向正确的方向发展。作家、艺术家必须揭露我们朝鲜人民的仇敌的丑恶面貌，揭露美帝国主义强盗及李承晚卖国匪帮。
    我们的作家、艺术家们应该谨记伟大的艺术的创造者是人民这件事。优秀的艺术作品没有不受人民爱护的。为人民所不能理解或没有人民的评价就不能成为优秀的艺术作品。
    我们的作家必须研究和广泛地利用人民文学，其中特别是民谣、古典文学等。但是，也不能说民谣都是好的，也不能说古典文学就能完全利用。但有一部分艺术家认为，只有原封不动地保存过去的民谣，才真是继承民族文化。这种倾向忘却了发展我们民族文化的基本路线。在民谣、音乐、舞踊等各部门，要保存我们民族固有的优秀的特点；同时，必须创造新生活要求的新的节奏、新的旋律和新的动作。我们的作家和艺术家必须用批判的方式来发展我们人民所具有的艺术、排除非科学的庸俗的艺术，使艺术达到高度的水平。与此同时，我们的作家、艺术家要以新的适当的内容，来利用人民所具有的许多艺术形式。
    我们的作家、艺术家在自己的创作工作中，必须激烈展开批评与自我批评。解放后，在我们的文学、艺术作品中，出现过带有形式主义倾向的作品，也出现过带有世界主义倾向的作品。虽然如此，我们文艺、批评界却表现得极为落后。毫无疑问，在创作工作上要没有健全的批评，是不会带来任何发展的。但是，要记住，一切批评的重点不应该放在“打击”上面，而应该把基本精神放在为取得更大的成果、采取正确路线的方面。但是，遗憾的是：过去有过不但不给作家和作品纠正错误，反而要“打倒”作家和作品的倾向。这种“批判”不是我们所要求的文学批评。除了最彻底和冷静的批评外，还应该有基于彻底公正的相互协助精神的文学批评，以便迅速和及时地纠正作家所犯的错误，使其向正确的方向发展，而取得更大的成果。犯错误并不可怕。在创作工作上是会有错误的。最可怕的是不过问错误和不及时纠正错误。与此同时，在文学、艺术界，必须和各种宗派的行动和倾向进行无情的斗争。
    我们的作家和艺术家要大量地吸收世界的先进文化，特别是以伟大苏联为首的各人民民主国家的文化。我们朝鲜的文学、艺术迄今不仅有许多落后的部门，而且在文学、艺术发展的基本方面也有许多需要纠正的地方。我们的作家和艺术家对先进的文学、艺术，应该抱着极郑重而认真的学习者的态度。我们应该记住，只有学习苏联先进的文化和艺术，才能建设灿烂的民族文化。在吸收苏联、中国和其他各人民民主国家的文化时，最值得注意的是这些国家的文化所具有的国际主义精神。我们的作家、艺术家必须以高度的国际主义精神来创作艺术作品。我们的文学、艺术到现在还未能很好地描写世界和平的堡垒——苏联、我祖国的伟大的解放者——苏联、我们人民的永远的朋友——苏联人民，未能很好地描写为反对美帝国主义野兽而在我们人民的神圣战争中光荣地和我们并肩作战的伟大的战友——中国人民志愿军的形象，未能很好地写出给予我们人民以热烈的兄弟般的声援和帮助的各人民民主国家人民的情形。我们朝鲜的作家和艺术家应该以高度的艺术性来表现这一场面，使它成为对侵略者和战争贩子们的严重警告，使他们发抖；让世界爱好和平人民热情地把它当作友谊之歌，当作人民为自由幸福之歌来歌唱。
    可敬的作家、艺术家们！朝鲜人民向你们提出了重大的任务。你们应该把我们人民的英雄的斗争和光辉的胜利介绍给世界人民，而且应该把它传给我们的后代。我们人民相信你们一定能够光荣地完成这一神圣任务。所以，我们空前地注意着你们的创作活动。英雄人民所要求的艺术，应该是英雄的东西。站在世界舞台上的人民所要求的艺术水平，应该提高到世界水平。人民要求你们为创作那种文学、艺术而倾注所有的心血。各位！你们是我们斗争中的人民所要求的伟大的武器——文学艺术的创作者。所以，你们是斗士。如果不是热爱祖国的作家，怎能创作出爱国主义的作品呢？人民所不喜欢的艺术家怎能创作出为人民的艺术呢？世界的伟大作家和艺术家们都是伟大的爱国者，是为人民幸福的伟大的斗士。所以，他们永远受着所有人民的爱护与尊敬，为人类所赞颂。今天我们朝鲜人民为了祖国战争的最后胜利，不顾一切痛苦和考验而前进。我和全体人民一起相信你们——英雄的我们人民的优秀儿女，也将在祖国与人民面前，以伟大的艺术作品贡献给全世界人民；并且能够很清楚地光荣地向后代传达英勇的我们的时代。
