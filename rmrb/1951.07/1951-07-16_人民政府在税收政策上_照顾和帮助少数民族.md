　　Since its establishment, the Central People's Government has followed the provisions of the Common Program and implemented a policy of care and assistance to all ethnic minorities in the country in terms of tax policy. In the autumn of 1950, the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government specially approved the exemption of goods tax on Yushu snuff, Usu cottonseed oil, and Tibetan incense in the Northwest Region. In early May of this year, the goods tax rate for border-sale tea (tea sold to border regions) on the southern Sichuan-Kangding Road and western Sichuan Road and Yunnan compressed tea (a type of border-sale tea) sold to Tibet was reduced from 25 percent to 5 percent. At the same time, in order to take care of the special living habits of the Yao people, it was decided that self-brewed and self-consumed wine in the Yao ethnic areas of Hunan Province would be temporarily exempt from goods tax. In terms of slaughter tax, on December 6 last year, the State Council of the Central People's Government issued a circular stating that during the three major festivals of Islam—Eid al-Adha (called Rouzi Festival in Xinjiang), Qurban (i.e., the Festival of Sacrifice), and Mawlid (called Molude Festival in Xinjiang)—cattle and sheep slaughtered for self-consumption by people of all ethnic groups who believe in Islam would be exempt from slaughter tax. It was also stipulated that in areas with restrictions on cattle slaughter, the tax authorities of the relevant provinces and cities should consult with the local people's governments to relax inspection standards. In terms of real estate tax, the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government issued a notice on January 26 this year, stipulating that the real estate occupied by Islamic mosques, prayer halls, tombs of saints (Gongbei), and Lamaist temples (Zha) themselves would be exempt from real estate tax. In addition, in terms of salt tax, differential tax rates were also adopted for various ethnic minority areas. For example, the tax rate for Mengqing salt in the Northwest is generally 40,000 yuan per dan, but the tax rate for salt sold to Songpan in western Sichuan is 28,000 yuan per dan; the general salt tax rate in Yunnan is 50,000 yuan per dan, but the tax rate for salt sold to ethnic minority areas is reduced to four levels: 40,000 yuan, 30,000 yuan, 20,000 yuan, and 10,000 yuan. The tax rate for Sichuan salt was originally 56,000 yuan per dan, but it was 20,000 yuan for salt sold to Guizhou. This greatly reduced the price of salt in ethnic minority areas.
　　The above-mentioned measures of the Central People's Government are in sharp contrast to the Kuomintang reactionary rulers' past cruel exploitation of ethnic minority areas through financial extortion and economically unequal exchanges, and have therefore won the heartfelt support of the people of all ethnic minorities.

　　人民政府在税收政策上
    照顾和帮助少数民族
    中央人民政府自成立以来，遵照共同纲领的规定，在税收政策上，对国内各少数民族实行了照顾和帮助的方针。一九五○年秋季，中央人民政府财政部特准西北区玉树鼻烟、乌苏棉油及藏香免征货物税。今年五月初，又将川康南路、四川西路的边销（销边疆地区）茶叶和销西藏的云南紧茶（边销茶的一种）的货物税税率由百分之二十五减为百分之五。与此同时，为照顾瑶胞特殊的生活习惯，决定湖南省瑶民区内自酿自饮的酒，暂时免征货物税。在屠宰税方面，去年十二月六日，中央人民政府政务院通令，遇伊斯兰教的尔代（新疆称肉孜节）、古尔邦（即宰牲节）、圣祭（新疆称冒路德节）三大节日，信仰伊斯兰教各民族人民自己食用的牛羊免征屠宰税；并规定：凡有限制宰牛的地方，各该省、市税务机关应商承当地人民政府放宽检验标准。在房地产税方面，中央人民政府财政部于今年一月二十六日发出通知，规定伊斯兰教的清真寺、礼拜寺、拱北（其教主墓地），和喇嘛教的喇嘛庙（召）等本身所占之房地，免征房地产税。此外，在盐税方面，对各少数民族地区，也采用了等差税制。如西北的蒙青盐，税率一般为每担四万元，但销川西松潘的盐，税率为每担二万八千元；云南的食盐税率一般为每担五万元，但销向少数民族地区的盐，税率就减为四万元、三万元、二万元、一万元四种。川盐税率本为每担五万六千元，但销往贵州的为二万元。这样就大大降低了少数民族地区的盐价。
    中央人民政府的上述措施，恰好与国民党反动统治者过去在少数民族地区进行财政上的横征暴敛和经济上的不等价交换等残酷剥削形成强烈的对照，因此得到了各少数民族人民的衷心拥护。
