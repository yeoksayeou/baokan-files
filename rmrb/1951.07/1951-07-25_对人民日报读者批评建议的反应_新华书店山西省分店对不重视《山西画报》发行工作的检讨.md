Response to Readers' Criticism and Suggestions in People's Daily
To the Editorial Board:

    The article "The Editing and Distribution of Shanxi Pictorial" written by Li Qun and published in the "Pictorial Review" section of the People's Daily on May 27th criticized our bookstore for not emphasizing the distribution of the pictorial. This opinion is of great help to improving our distribution work, and we sincerely accept it. We did not consider the political impact of the pictorial in its distribution, and we had a purely economic viewpoint, fearing economic losses if it could not be sold. Therefore, we did not think of ways to promote sales, so that the distribution of the pictorial could not be developed as it should be. This is something we should examine. We must improve ourselves through the examination of this matter, and educate our internal staff, and in the future, we must attach importance to and improve the distribution of books and periodicals.

    对人民日报读者批评建议的反应
　　新华书店山西省分店对不重视《山西画报》发行工作的检讨编辑同志：
    五月二十七日人民日报“画报评论”上发表了力群所写的“山西画报的编辑和发行”一文，其中批评本店对该画报的发行没有重视，这意见对我们发行工作的改进有着很大帮助，我们表示诚恳地接受。我们对该画报发行没有从它的政治影响上去考虑，存在着单纯的经济观点，怕销不出去受到经济上的损失，因而没有很好地想办法多推销，使该画报的发行不能得到应有的开展。这是我们应该检讨的。我们要从这件事的检讨中提高自己，并教育内部工作同志，今后要重视并改进书刊的发行工作。
            新华书店山西省分店
