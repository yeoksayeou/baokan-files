Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 28th: TASS reports that *Izvestia*'s foreign affairs commentator, Mikhailov, wrote an article in the international commentary section commenting on Truman's semi-annual economic report to the US Congress a few days ago, stating that the US President insists on further increasing the US armed forces and arms production "regardless of whether peace is restored in Korea."

　　This means that the US ruling clique is unwilling to consider the demands of the world's people to stop the arms race. The current rulers of the United States openly state that they intend to continue the artificially created atmosphere of military "boom" in the economy, increase international tensions, and intensify preparations for a new war.

　　Truman's current idea that "Korea is insignificant" is completely contradictory to the countless statements he made throughout the past year, using the Korean incident as a "pretext" for his every new demand for increased military spending. But Truman is not at all embarrassed by this contradiction. Now, Truman curses all those who, seeing that the armistice negotiations have begun in Korea and that methods are being taken to peacefully resolve this most acute issue, are demanding a reduction in military spending.

　　The US ruling clique has thus once again shown that their propaganda about so-called promoting the environment for the militarization of the American economy is completely false. Truman now insists that the arms race must be carried out because there is a "potential threat" to the United States in other parts of the world. However, it is well known that no other country but the United States is establishing military bases all over the world, sending troops to other countries, interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, and using its President's roving envoys to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. It was the United States that created the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and used it as the main tool for preparing aggression against peace-loving countries. It is the US ruling clique that has shamelessly violated their international obligations and used obstructionist tactics to undermine the possibility of peaceful settlement of international disputes. In order to conceal the true purpose of their measures to maintain a state of war at home, they need to fabricate lies about military dangers, insisting that this danger threatens the United States.

　　The American billionaires are unwilling to give up the huge profits given to them by the arms race, and hope that the continuation of the military "scene" can avoid economic panic. Truman said in his economic report that in the first six months of 1951, US spending on the arms race increased by 50%; it is expected to increase to almost double by mid-1952. According to this report, most of this huge expenditure will go into the pockets of large manufacturers of aircraft, tanks, and other weapons, whose profits have increased by one and a half or two times in the past year alone.

　　Therefore, the purpose of the US ruling clique's policy is to guarantee new extremely high profits for US military monopoly capital enterprises. It is equally clear that the US ruling clique's hope that the arms race will save the US capitalist economy from a new crisis is unfounded. In his economic report, Truman had to admit to the growth of inflation, the rise in wholesale and retail prices, and the reduction in people's purchasing power. Truman cannot hide the fact that millions of people are unemployed.

　　Mikhailov concluded by saying that the US ruling clique's aggressive policy will only lead the United States to new failures on the international stage and to another economic crisis.

　　消息报发表米哈依洛夫论文
　  评美国坚持备战政策
　  美垄断资本家妄图制造战争空气
　  进行超额榨取和避免经济恐慌
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十八日讯：《消息报》外交评论家米哈依洛夫在国际述评栏中撰文评论杜鲁门数天前向美国国会提出的半年经济报告说：美国总统坚持进一步增加美国的武装部队和军备生产，“不论朝鲜的和平是否恢复”。
    这意味着美国统治集团不愿意考虑世界人民提出的停止扩张军备运动的要求，美国的目前的统治者公开表示他们打算继续那种人工制造的经济中的军事“景气”的气氛，增加国际的紧张局势，和加紧准备新战争。
    杜鲁门目前所谓“朝鲜非关紧要”的想法，和他在去年整整一年中所发表的、用朝鲜事件作为他每一次增加军事拨款的新要求的“口实”的无数声明，是完全矛盾的。可是杜鲁门一点不因为这种矛盾而感到狼狈。现在杜鲁门咒诅一切因为看到停战谈判已在朝鲜开始并且已在采取方法和平解决这个最尖锐问题而要求减少军事拨款的人们。
    美国统治集团就这样又一次表明，他们所进行的关于所谓促成美国经济军事化的环境的宣传是完全虚伪的。杜鲁门现在硬说所以必须进行扩张军备运动，是由于世界其他地区存在着对美国的“潜在威胁”。但是，尽人皆知，没有其他的国家、只有美国正在全世界建立军事基地，派遣军队到别的国家去，干涉别国的内政，并且以它的总统的巡回特使来做干涉别国内政的事情。正是美国制造了北大西洋公约，把它作为准备侵略爱好和平国家的主要工具。正是美国统治集团无耻地违反了他们的国际义务，并且以阻挠手段，来破坏和平解决国际纠纷的可能性。为了要掩饰他们想维持国内战争状态的措施的真正目的，他们需要制造一些关于军事危险的谎言，硬说这种危险威胁着美国。
    美国的亿万富翁们不愿放弃扩张军备运动给与他们的巨额利润，并且希望军事“景象”的继续能使经济恐慌得以避免。杜鲁门在他的经济报告中说，在一九五一年头六个月，美国用于扩张军备运动的费用增加了百分之五十；到一九五二年年中还可望增加到差不多两倍。由这份报告看来，这笔庞大经费中的大部分将装进飞机、坦克及其他武器的大制造商的腰包，单单在最近一年中，他们的利润就增加了一倍半或者两倍。
    因此，美国统治集团的政策的目的是要为美国军事垄断资本企业保证新的极高额的利润。同样明显，美国统治集团所抱的扩张军备运动会挽救美国资本主义经济免于新危机的希望是毫无根据的。杜鲁门在他的经济报告中不得不供认通货膨胀的增长，批发和零售价格的上涨，以及人民购买力的缩减。杜鲁门掩饰不了几百万人失业的事实。
    米哈依洛夫在结语中说：美国统治集团的侵略方针，将只能引导美国在国际舞台上走向新的失败，和走向另一次经济危机。
