　　美驻匈使馆人员进行间谍活动
    匈政府将其驱逐出境
    【新华社六日讯】塔斯社布达佩斯讯：匈牙利外交部新闻处宣布：匈牙利政府二日要求美国政府召回那些在审讯格拉兹及其同谋犯一案时证明曾进行间谍及破坏活动的美国驻匈公使馆人员。美国驻匈公使馆代办莫克马特根据这一要求，请求匈牙利政府发给美国公使馆秘书谢莱尔和参赞特里昂以出境签证，准许他们在七月五日离开匈牙利国境。但在同一天，美国公使馆又通知匈牙利外交部说，需要匈牙利政府宣布上述人员为“不受欢迎的人”之后，美国政府才让他们离开匈牙利。匈牙利外交部五日以照会一件递交美国驻匈公使馆，宣布美国公使馆的上述两人是“不受欢迎的人”，并建议他们在二十四小时之内离开匈牙利国境。
