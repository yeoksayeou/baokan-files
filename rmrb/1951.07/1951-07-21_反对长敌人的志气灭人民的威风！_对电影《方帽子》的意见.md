　　Oppose Aggrandizing the Enemy's Ambition
　　Diminishing the People's Prestige!
　　——Opinions on the Film "The Square Hat"

To the Editor:

　　The film "The Square Hat" (written by Tao Qin, directed by Li Pingqian and Liu Qiong, produced by Great Wall Film Company), recently shown in Beijing, is a bad film. It depicts university students from the "September 18th Incident" to the "July 7th Incident." However, its theme is not the vigorous student movement for national salvation, but the story of a tailor who is single-mindedly trying to climb up the social ladder and his spineless son. This tailor despises his own profession and is determined for his son to go to university, wear a "square hat," become an official, and get rich. Therefore, he begs his son to go to school and sends him to a Westernized university. A university student who is the son of a minister takes advantage of and buys him off, but abandons him after graduation. At this time, the War of Resistance Against Japan breaks out, and this disappointed university student goes to fight the Japanese. There is also a lower-level civil servant's daughter in the film who is portrayed as a positive character. She runs a free school and refuses to be humiliated by the minister's son. However, her father desperately tries to curry favor with this minister's "young master," and finally gets promoted because of it. Later, because his daughter refuses to befriend the minister's son, he loses his official position as well. He then vents his anger on his daughter, and in the end, this daughter also goes to fight the Japanese.

　　What are the important scenes on the screen? On the one hand, it is the tailor and the civil servant's obsequious behavior towards the minister's young master, as well as the tailor's tyranny towards his wife and apprentices, and the civil servant's unreasonable behavior towards the tailor; on the other hand, it is the minister's young master's imposing manner and the sycophancy of his followers. These reactionary or critical characters dominate the entire screen. The progressive daughter and some progressive students and professors are only used as supporting characters to highlight the dark side and appear only occasionally. It is utterly absurd that the writers and directors have the reactionary principal deliver a fallacious speech against patriotism, while the progressive students only say a few words to promote national salvation. I think there is a problem worth mentioning here, and this problem is not completely isolated, but has a certain degree of universality. In some dramas or films, in order to emphasize the ferocity and brutality of the enemy, the enemy's power is particularly exaggerated, while the people's resistance struggle is downplayed or even ignored. What appears on the stage or screen is the activity of arrogant and domineering negative characters, which on the surface seems to be saying, "Look how bad they are!" but in reality gives the impression: "Look how impressive they are!" It makes progressive people nauseous and confuses backward people; it aggrandizes the enemy's ambition and diminishes the people's prestige. We oppose negative characters dominating our stage or screen, and we should exercise dictatorship over reactionaries in all respects.

　　Secondly, I think that portraying the handicraft tailor as a shameless social climber is also an intolerable insult to the working people. Even the lower-level civil servant is not an object we should focus on satirizing. It is not to say that there were no such people in the past real life as the tailor and the lower-level civil servant in the film. There were, but these were only extremely isolated cases. The reason why they had the idea of climbing up the social ladder was also the result of being influenced by the ideology of the ruling class in the old society. The duty of artistic workers is not to satirize the shortcomings and backward aspects of the working people, but to adopt an attitude of education and transformation.

　　Furthermore, the film's depiction of students and historical facts is also distorted. To depict the university situation from the "September 18th Incident" to the "July 7th Incident," choosing a Westernized university with only dozens of students, which is dominated by a few "minister's" and "director's" young masters and misses, is not representative. The few progressive students and professors in the school only give speeches and scold the young masters and misses... This is not enough to illustrate their practical role in making progress. The two young men and women, one failed to climb up the social ladder, and the other disliked the minister's son and suffered from his father's anger, and finally went to fight the Japanese. Is this the general motivation for students to participate in the national salvation movement? This is an insult to patriotic young students and a distortion of the vigorous student anti-Japanese national salvation movement from the "September 18th Incident" to the "July 7th Incident."

### 反对长敌人的志气灭人民的威风！——对电影《方帽子》的意见

　　反对长敌人的志气
　  灭人民的威风！
　  ——对电影《方帽子》的意见编辑同志：
    最近在北京上演的影片《方帽子》（陶秦编剧，李萍倩、刘琼导演，长城公司出品）是一部坏影片。它是描写从“九一八”到“七七”的大学学生的。但它的主题不是轰轰烈烈的学生救亡运动，而是描写一个一心想向上爬的裁缝和他的没有骨头的儿子。这个裁缝很厌弃自己的职业，一心想让儿子上大学戴“方帽子”，做官发财，于是跪求儿子上学，把儿子送进一所洋化大学。有一位大学生是部长的儿子，便利用和收买了他，而毕业后却又把他抛在一旁。这时正是抗日战争爆发，这位失望的大学生就抗日去了。影片中还有一个低级公务员的女儿是被当作正面人物表现的。她办义务学校，不愿受部长儿子的侮辱。但是她的父亲却拼命巴结这位部长的“少爷”，终于借此升了官。后来因为女儿不肯和部长的儿子要好，以致他也失掉了官。他便对女儿大发脾气，最后，这位女儿也抗日去了。
    银幕上的重要情景是什么呢？一方面是裁缝和公务员对部长少爷的卑躬屈膝，以及裁缝对妻子及学徒，公务员对裁缝的蛮横无理；一方面是部长少爷的威风凛凛及其走狗的奉迎。这些反动的或值得批判的人物统治着整个银幕。而那位进步的女儿和一些进步的学生和教授，只是当作烘托黑暗面的配角，偶然出现而已。十分荒谬的是，编导者让反动校长发表了一篇反对爱国的谬论，而进步学生鼓吹救亡的话反倒只有几句。我认为其中有一个值得提出的问题，这问题不是完全孤立的，它带有某种程度的普遍性。在某些戏剧或电影中，为了强调敌人的凶恶和残暴，把敌人的威风作了特别夸张的描写，而把人民的反抗斗争加以轻描淡写，或甚至忽略了。舞台上或银幕上出现的是耀武扬威横行霸道的反面人物的活动，表面上似乎是说：“你看他们多坏！”实际上却给人的印象是：“你看他们多神气啊！”它使进步的人作呕，使落后的人迷惑；长敌人的志气灭人民的威风。我们反对反派人物统治我们的舞台或银幕，我们对反动派应该是无往而不专政。
    其次，我认为影片中把那个手工业者裁缝描写成为无耻的向上爬的狗，也是一种对劳动人民不可容忍的侮辱。即如那位下级公务员，也不是我们应该着重讽刺的对象。像影片中那位裁缝和那位下级公务员，不是说过去现实生活中没有这样的人，有的，但这只是极其个别的，他们所以有向上爬的思想，也是在旧社会中，受统治阶级思想影响的结果。对于劳动人民的缺点和落后的方面，艺术工作者的职责不应是讽刺，而应该采取教育改造的态度。
    再者，这部影片对学生和对历史事实的描写也是歪曲的。要描写“九一八”到“七七”的大学情形，选择一个只有几十个学生的洋化大学，这个大学被少数的“部长”“处长”的少爷小姐统治着，这也不是具有代表性的。学校中的几个进步学生和教授，他们只对少爷小姐讲演，骂……，这也不足以说明他们进步的实际作用。那两位男女青年一个是向上爬不成功，一个是厌弃部长的儿子，受爸爸的气，最后抗日去了，难道这是学生参加抗日救亡的普遍动机吗？这是对于爱国的青年学生的侮辱，对于从“九一八”到“七七”全国轰轰烈烈的学生抗日救亡运动的歪曲。
