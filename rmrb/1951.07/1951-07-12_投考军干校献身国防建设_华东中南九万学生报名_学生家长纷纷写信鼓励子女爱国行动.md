Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 11th: The application work for young students in most areas of East China to participate in military cadre schools has basically ended. According to preliminary statistics from seven regions including Shandong, Shanghai, Nanjing, Fuzhou, Northern Jiangsu, Southern Anhui, and Zhejiang, the number of applicants has reached 58,000.

Due to the increased political awareness of the majority of students and their parents during the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the number of students applying in various regions this time has exceeded the planned enrollment quota by several times. In many areas, the application work was successfully completed in just one or two days. The total number of student applicants in Fuzhou City exceeded the enrollment quota by ten times. At Jinan No. 2 Middle School, more than 800 people applied within one hour of the start of registration. Students at Yangzhou Middle School in Northern Jiangsu discussed the Korean armistice negotiations and unanimously agreed that as long as imperialism exists in the world, we must strengthen national defense construction, because only in this way can peace be guaranteed. In two days, the number of applicants increased from 548 to 808. When Nanjing City officially processed registration procedures on the morning of the 7th, the news of the American imperialists' indiscriminate bombing of Pyongyang was published in the newspaper; this further aroused the indignation of young students, who actively applied to participate in military cadre schools. On that day, the number of student applicants in the city reached 5,000. Zhang Caihong, a student at the Affiliated Middle School of Nanjing University, said: "Amidst the sounds of the Korean armistice negotiations, the American imperialists indiscriminately bombed Pyongyang, which made me further recognize the face of imperialism. I must participate in a military cadre school."

Many students not only wrote "Resolutions to Resolutely Respond to the Call of the Motherland" before applying, but also expressed during registration that they would resolutely obey the assignments. If they were not accepted, they would stay in school to study and guarantee the implementation of the patriotic convention.

Parents in various regions enthusiastically encouraged their children to apply to military cadre schools. Li Shufang, a woman from Hangzhou City, already had three children who participated in military cadre schools last time. This time, she encouraged her fourth daughter to apply. The Guarantee Committees of various schools in Northern Jiangsu received many letters from parents. These letters all requested that the Guarantee Committees approve their children to go to national defense construction posts. Li Yuting's mother, a student at Yangzhou Middle School, wrote to the school's Guarantee Committee, saying: "Last year, when the military cadre schools were recruiting, my thinking was not clear, so I prevented my son from participating in the military cadre school. Over the past seven months, I have participated in the reading group and received education about Resist America, Aid Korea. My understanding has improved, and I feel that when the motherland needs my son, I should dedicate him to the motherland." The mother of Li Yuntong, a student at Siyi Industrial School in Wuhu City, Southern Anhui, wrote from her distant hometown to encourage her son to participate in a military cadre school. Many parents are now busy preparing gifts to send off their children.

Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 11th: Students in various parts of the Central South region are enthusiastically applying to participate in various military cadre schools. According to incomplete statistics from some areas of Jiangxi, Hubei, Henan, and Guangxi provinces, and Wuhan and Guangzhou cities, the number of college and middle school students applying to participate in various military cadre schools has reached 34,400, greatly exceeding the planned enrollment quota for various military cadre schools in the Central South region.

This time, the recruitment work for various military cadre schools in the Central South region proceeded very rapidly. Before the start of registration, students in various regions extensively and thoroughly discussed the Korean armistice negotiations and studied relevant documents on participating in various military cadre schools, establishing the belief that "only by consolidating national defense can we achieve and consolidate lasting peace for the motherland and the world." At the same time, due to the series of patriotic and current affairs education that schools in various regions have carried out among students in the past six months, the students' political awareness throughout the region has been unprecedentedly enhanced. Therefore, when the recruitment committees of military cadre schools in various regions began processing registration procedures, students eagerly and enthusiastically registered. In Wuhan and Guangzhou, after holding symposiums on the "Korean Armistice Negotiations," the number of applicants quickly reached more than 11,000. In Jiangxi Province, within four days from July 1st to 4th, 8,156 people applied. In Henan Province, students applying from only four cities and counties, namely Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Xinyang, and Yuxian, numbered more than 4,500. In Hubei Province, students applying from fifty secondary schools in five special districts, namely Daye, Jingzhou, Xiangyang, Yunyang, and Huanggang, and two cities, namely Shashi and Yichang, numbered 7,900. In Guangxi Province, more than 2,800 students have already applied. All students meeting the requirements from private Dayu Middle School in Jiangxi, Zhixin Girls' Middle School in Guangzhou (junior high graduation class), Wuhan No. 1 Middle School, and Hubei No. 1 Girls' Middle School have applied.

Students in various regions who applied to participate in military cadre schools were enthusiastically encouraged by their parents. In Wuhan, 120 mothers not only encouraged their children to apply to military cadre schools, but also actively participated in publicity and mobilization work, making more parents willing for their children to take on glorious national defense posts.

Currently, except for Guangdong, Hunan, and Guangxi provinces, where the recruitment work is still in progress due to its recent start, the registration work in Jiangxi, Hubei, Henan provinces, and Wuhan and Guangzhou cities has basically ended. The recruitment committees and guarantee committees in the aforementioned areas where registration has been completed are busy examining students' physical fitness and reviewing guarantee work.

    【新华社上海十一日电】华东大部分地区青年学生参加军事干部学校的报名工作已基本结束。据山东、上海、南京、福州、苏北、皖南、浙江等七个地区的初步统计，报名人数达五万八千人。
    由于广大学生和他们的父母在抗美援朝运动中提高了政治觉悟，这次各地报名的学生人数都几倍地超过了预定招收的名额，许多地区的报名工作在一、两天内即顺利结束。福州市学生报名总数超过了招收名额的十倍。济南市第二中学在开始报名的一小时内就有八百多人报了名。苏北区扬州中学的学生讨论了朝鲜停战谈判问题后，一致认为世界上有帝国主义存在一天，我们就要加强国防建设，只有这样和平才有保障。两天中报名人数由五百四十八名增加到八百零八名。南京市在七日上午正式办理报名手续时，报上刊载了美帝国主义滥炸平壤的消息；更加激起了青年学生们的义愤，纷纷报名参加军事干部学校。当天全市报名学生即达五千人。南京大学附属中学学生张才鸿说：“在朝鲜停战谈判声中，美帝国主义竟然滥炸平壤，这使我进一步认清了帝国主义的面目。我一定要参加军事干部学校。”
    许多学生不仅在报名前写下了“坚决响应祖国号召”的决心书，在报名时还表示：坚决服从分配，如不录取就留校学习，保证贯彻爱国公约。
    各地学生家长热情地鼓励子女们报名参加军事干部学校。杭州市的一位妇女李淑芳已有三个儿女在上次参加了军事干部学校，这次她又鼓励她的第四个女儿去报名。苏北区各校保送委员会收到很多家长的来信。这些信件都要求保送委员会批准他们的子女走上国防建设的岗位。扬州中学学生李育庭的母亲写信给该校保送委员会说：“去年军事干部学校招生时，我的思想搞不通，所以阻止了我的儿子参加军事干部学校。七个多月来我参加了读报组，受到了抗美援朝的教育，我的认识提高了，我觉得当祖国需要我的儿子的时候，我应该把他献给祖国。”皖南区芜湖市内思工职学校学生李允同的母亲，从辽远的家乡来信，鼓励她的儿子参加军事干部学校。很多学生家长现在正忙着准备礼物欢送自己的子女。
    【新华社汉口十一日电】中南区各地学生热烈报名参加各种军事干部学校。据江西、湖北、河南及广西等省部分地区和武汉、广州两市的不完全统计，各地报名参加各种军事干部学校的大、中学校学生已达三万四千四百余人，大大地超过了各种军事干部学校在中南区的预定招生名额。
    此次各种军事干部学校在中南区的招生工作进行得非常迅速。在报名开始前，各地学生普遍深入地讨论了朝鲜停战谈判问题，并学习了有关参加各种军事干部学校的文件，树立了“只有巩固国防才能取得和巩固祖国与世界的持久和平”的信念。同时，由于半年来各地学校向学生进行了一连串的爱国主义时事教育，全区学生的政治觉悟空前提高，因之当各地军事干部学校招生委员会开始办理报名手续时，学生们便迫不及待地踊跃地报了名。武汉和广州两市学生在开过“朝鲜停战谈判问题”的座谈会后，报名人数迅即达到一万一千余人。江西省各地学生从七月一日到四日四天内，报名者达八千一百五十六人。河南省仅开封、郑州、信阳、禹县四个市、县报名的学生就有四千五百余人。湖北省大冶、荆州、襄阳、郧阳、黄冈五个专区和沙市、宜昌两市五十个中等学校报名的学生达七千九百余人。广西省报名的学生已有两千八百名以上。江西私立大庾中学、广州执信女中本届初中毕业班、武汉市第一中学、湖北省第一女中等校适合条件的学生全部都报了名。
    各地报名参加军事干部学校的学生纷纷受到了家长们的热情鼓励。武汉市有一百二十个母亲不仅鼓励自己的子女报名参加军事干部学校，并积极地参加了宣传动员工作，使更多的学生家长愿意自己的子女走上光荣的国防岗位。
    目前，除广东、湖南、广西等省的招生工作因开始不久，还在继续办理报名手续外，江西、湖北、河南等省和武汉、广州两市的报名工作已基本上结束。上述报名完毕的地区的招生委员会和保送委员会正忙于检查学生体格和审查保送工作。
