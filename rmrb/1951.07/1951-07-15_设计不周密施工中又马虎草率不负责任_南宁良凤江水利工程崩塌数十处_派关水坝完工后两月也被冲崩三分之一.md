Due to Poor Design and Careless, Sloppy, Irresponsible Construction
    Dozens of Collapses in Nanning's Liangfeng River Water Conservancy Project
    Paiguan Dam Collapses One-Third Two Months After Completion
    The Liangfeng River Water Conservancy Project in the suburbs of Nanning City, Guangxi, suffered dozens of collapses after a test run of water release in June this year due to a lack of thorough design before construction and sloppy, careless construction practices. The Guangxi Suilu Paiguan Water Conservancy Project also collapsed by one-third of the dam due to the same reasons, two months after its completion in April.
    The Liangfeng River Water Conservancy Project started in September last year. At that time, the Nanning Municipal People's Government only saw that undertaking the Liangfeng River Water Conservancy Project could provide relief to unemployed workers and suburban farmers in the city and stabilize social order, so construction began blindly before a construction plan was drafted. The design of the Liangfeng River Water Conservancy Project was not thorough enough, and the necessary investigation and research on the soil quality of the construction site was not conducted. After the earth excavation project on Turtle Back Mountain began, it was discovered that the mountain was weathered rock, and the soil quality of the weathered rock was very poor, and it would collapse after being scoured by water. After discovering this problem during construction, the project leaders still did not pay attention to research, and the earth excavation project continued as usual. During the earth excavation project at Cangheilv, traces of springs were found, but the amount of spring water could not be determined. The project leaders did not conduct in-depth surveys or seek advice from the masses, and the project continued as usual. As a result, spring water slowly gushed out, soaking the filled soil, and the project collapsed for eighty meters. The construction of the project was also very sloppy. During the construction of Gaoshantang and other fill-soil projects, it was found that the filling and compaction work was very insufficient. However, the responsible cadres of the project department did not supervise and educate the compaction workers to improve the work. Therefore, the compaction workers were slack and only did the surface well to complete the work. After the water was released, these fillings slowly subsided, and even fillings three or four meters high subsided by one meter, causing the channel water to fail to flow into the aqueduct and pour out to the sides. The seventh culvert of the project also completely collapsed after water release due to the lack of structural integrity.
    The people in charge of the Liangfeng River project took an extremely irresponsible attitude toward the project. After nine months of construction, the project cost was repeatedly increased, totaling more than 5 billion yuan. In early June, the entire line was basically completed, and a test run of water release was carried out. During the first, second, and third water tests, water leakage and collapse were found one after another before the water reached the end, and repairs were carried out several times. However, during the fourth water test, the responsible cadres of the project department took a very irresponsible attitude. They neither sent people to patrol the canal to report the water flow situation at any time, nor did the responsible personnel close the gate when they went to bed. As a result, due to the heavy rain all night, the amount of water in the canal suddenly increased, causing the collapse of the project. Throughout the entire project, the cadres never reported the situation, and the leading cadres did not convene cadres to discuss and study the problems that had been discovered. There was also disunity among the cadres. Administrative cadres believed that technical cadres were undisciplined and unwilling to guide them; technical cadres believed that administrative cadres did not understand technology, and were unwilling to raise problems for research when they were discovered; there were also factions among technical cadres, and they did not cooperate. There was a serious purely task-oriented view among the general cadres. In order to rush the task, they sought quantity over quality in earthwork, and completely did not consider how serious consequences would be caused by sloppy work.
    After the project had problems, the people in charge of the project still did not have a sufficient understanding of the problems, and used the excuse that the personnel were not gathered to fail to conduct group discussions in accordance with the instructions of the superiors to find out the ideological roots and overcome the difficulties. They also used the excuse of rain to fail to promptly dispatch to check the project situation. The relevant leading organs should urge them to quickly change this irresponsible attitude towards the people's cause.
    The Paiguan Water Conservancy Project started construction on January 13th this year. The main errors in the project design were that the slope was too steep (about 40 degrees), and the water flow was very rapid; the distance from the end of the slope to the stilling basin (a structure under the gate to slow down the water flow) of the sea-man (a structure behind the gate to reduce the impact of water flow) was too short (only about six feet). Moreover, the stilling basin was slightly triangular, and after the water flowed down, it was greatly resisted as soon as it hit the stilling basin. When it turned back, it still had a great force to counterattack the dam body. The masses saw that the sea-man was too short and raised opinions to the engineer, telling him that it would be safer to extend it by a few feet. But the engineer said: "It doesn't matter, we have always done this in the past, and we guarantee that there will be no problems, so you can rest assured! — Moreover, the drawing has already been drawn like this, and it is not good to change it again." The leading cadres of the project also did not pay attention to this problem, so they started construction carelessly according to the drawings. Before construction started, a contract was not signed with the contractor, so that the project could not be inspected after construction started. The supervisors had neither experience nor thoroughly inspected the project at any time. The construction of the project was extremely sloppy. In many places, stones were simply placed and lime was poured, without further processing and consolidation, so the foundation was extremely unstable. These situations were not discovered until the dam body was washed away. After the project was completed in April this year and water was released, there were several heavy rains, and the river water rose sharply, and one-third of the newly built dam body was washed away. In addition to seriously conducting self-criticism, Suilu County has reported to the Nanning Prefecture and requested that personnel be sent to study remedial measures. (Guangxi Daily)

### 设计不周密施工中又马虎草率不负责任  南宁良凤江水利工程崩塌数十处  派关水坝完工后两月也被冲崩三分之一

　　设计不周密施工中又马虎草率不负责任
    南宁良凤江水利工程崩塌数十处
    派关水坝完工后两月也被冲崩三分之一
    广西南宁市郊良凤江水利工程，由于施工前未做周密设计，施工中草率马虎，因此，今年六月试行放水后，工程崩塌数十处。广西绥渌派关水利工程，也由于同样的原故，四月完工放水后，到六月中，水坝就被大水冲崩了三分之一。
    良凤江水利工程是去年九月开工的。当时南宁市人民政府只看到兴办良凤江水利工程可以救济该市失业工人和市郊农民，安定社会秩序，所以施工计划尚未拟好，就盲目施工。良凤江水利工程的设计是不够周密的，对工地土质未做必要的调查研究。龟背山挖土工程开始后，才发现该山是风化石，风化石土质很坏，水流冲刷后即塌陷。施工中发现了这个问题以后，工程负责人员仍未注意研究，挖土工程照常进行。苍黑驴挖土工程进行中，发现了泉迹，但不能判断泉水的多少，工程负责人员既不深入勘察，也不找群众研究，工程照样进行。结果泉水慢慢涌出，浸湿填土，工程塌陷了八十公尺长。该工程施工也非常马虎。高山塘及其他填土工程进行中，发现填土和硪工做得非常不够。但该工程处负责干部仍未监督教育硪工加工，因此硪工松懈，仅将表面打好就应付交工。放水后这些填土即慢慢下陷，甚至三、四公尺高的填土竟下陷一公尺，使渠水不能流入渡槽，而向两旁倾泻。该工程第七涵洞也因工程不坚固，放水后全部崩塌。
    良凤江工程的负责人员对工程采取了极不负责的态度。工程经过九个月的建筑，工程费屡次追加，共用五十余亿元。六月初，全线基本竣工，试行放水。第一、二、三次试水时，水未放到头就先后发现有漏水和崩缺现象，进行了数次修补。但是在第四次试水时，工程处负责干部竟然采取十分不负责任的态度，既未派人巡查渠道，随时报告水流情况，负责人员睡觉时又不关闭闸门，结果因为整夜大雨，渠道水量骤增，促成工程的崩塌。在整个工程进行中，干部从不汇报情况，领导干部也未召集干部商讨研究已经发现了的问题。干部之间也不团结。行政干部认为技术干部自由散漫，不愿加以指导；技术干部认为行政干部不懂技术，发现问题也不肯提出研究；技术干部之间也闹派别，不合作。一般干部中间存在着严重的单纯任务观点，为了赶任务，在土方工作上求量不求质，完全没有考虑到马虎从事将要引起怎样严重的后果。
    工程发生问题后，该处负责人员对问题仍认识不足，借口人员召集不齐，而不依照上级指示分组检讨，找出思想根源和克服办法。又以天雨为借口，未及时出动检查工程情况。有关领导机关应督促他们迅速改变这种对人民事业不负责任的态度。
    派关水利工程是今年一月十三日开始修建的。工程设计的主要错误是坡度太大（约四十度），水流很急；由斜坡尽头到消水坎（闸门下面使水流缓慢的一种建筑物）的海漫（闸门后面减少流水冲击力的一种建筑物）距离又太短（仅六尺左右）。并且消水坎略似三角形，水流下来后，一冲到消水坎，就受到很大阻力，转回头时，仍有很大力量向坝身反击。群众看到海漫太短，曾向工程师提出意见，告诉他延长几尺较有把握。但工程师却说：“不要紧，我们过去都是这样做，保证没有问题，你们放心吧！——而且图已这样画了，不好再改。”该工程领导干部也没有重视这个问题，就马马虎虎照图开工。开工前也未与包工者签订合同，以致开工后无法检查工程。监工的人既无经验，也未对工程随时详加检查。工程修建极为草率，很多地方只是放下石头，倒下石灰，而未再加工打牢，所以基础极不稳固。这些情况，直到坝身被冲崩后才发现。今年四月工程完工，放水后下了几次大雨，河水陡涨，新修的坝身就被冲崩三分之一。绥渌县除认真进行检讨外，已报告南宁专署，请求派员研究补救办法。        （广西日报）
