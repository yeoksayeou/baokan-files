"Glory is given to us by the Party and Chairman Mao!"
—A report to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao by Zheng Shoufa, the Party Group Leader of a Model Platoon of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, in commemoration of the 30th anniversary of the Party—

I am Zheng Shoufa, the deputy platoon leader and Party group leader of the Fourth Platoon, First Company, of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army. Our Fourth Platoon is an ordinary platoon in the People's Liberation Army, just like platoons in other units. Since our platoon was established in July 1945, it has been six full years, and there have been no non-combat attrition. All the comrades in our platoon are very happy, feel very honored, and say, "This glory is given to us by Chairman Mao, and is the result of the correct leadership of the Party and higher authorities." Today, in order to welcome the 30th anniversary of the Party, I am here to report on the work of our platoon to the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the people of the whole country.

Our platoon was initially a local detachment, later it grew and was upgraded to a local main force, and then it was upgraded to a field army. Since our platoon started fighting in 1946, it has fought in thirteen siege battles and six pursuit battles, twice marching west to Suiyuan, and participating in several major campaigns such as Baoding South, Baoding North, Pingzhang, and Taiyuan. After the liberation of North China, our unit launched training and production, and took on the glorious task of defending the national defense. Up to now, for six full years, we have carried forward the glorious tradition of unity and consolidation of our People's Liberation Army. There has not been a single desertion in the platoon, and not a single person has been sent to the hospital due to illness. Since the Liberation War in 1946, we have completed many important tasks in numerous large and small battles, and have received several rewards from higher authorities, but there has never been a single casualty. In the Taiyuan Campaign alone, our platoon captured twenty-nine enemies, seized two light machine guns, two small cannons, and more than ten rifles. During training, our platoon won the "Model Fortress Grand Merit Platoon" award banner for consolidating the troops; during production, our platoon won the title of "Model Production Platoon." Three company-level cadres, five platoon-level cadres, and eleven squad leaders have been promoted from our platoon. Fourteen comrades have gloriously joined the Communist Party, and two have joined the Communist Youth League. Over such a long period, the platoon leader and veteran soldiers have been constantly promoted and transferred, and new members have been constantly added, but our platoon has always been united and consolidated. All our comrades have been inheriting and developing this glorious tradition.

	Conducting Communist Party and class education regularly
	Party group helps everyone improve their ideological level

The People's Liberation Army is an army of the people. The soldiers are all people who were oppressed in the old society and voluntarily joined the army to make revolution. Our troops have the correct leadership of the Communist Party, and the army is built according to Chairman Mao's military thought and instructions, so it cannot be defeated or disintegrated. Our Fourth Platoon is the same. Since the establishment of the platoon, the Party and higher authorities have constantly educated us, saying: Our troops are the people's army, a force that wholeheartedly serves the people and seeks liberation for the people. Comrades work together to make revolution, they are all class brothers, even closer than real brothers. Everyone should carry forward class love, unite and make progress, to complete the tasks given to us by the people. This is how we have done it. No matter when, everyone is always of one heart and mind. However, because the comrades are mostly from peasant backgrounds, sometimes they cannot see things in the long term, and they also have some wrong ideas. At this time, the higher authorities and the Party branch immediately point them out to us, so that we can quickly correct them. The Party group in our platoon also pays special attention to the comrades' ideological activities. When problems are discovered, the group first holds a meeting to study them, first straightens out the thinking within the Party, unifies understanding, and then solves them. Party members can also take the initiative to help the masses solve problems and play a backbone role.

Our platoon's Party group helps comrades solve ideological problems, and there are no special tricks, only one: to explain the revolutionary principles clearly and enlighten class consciousness. For example, in the winter of 1947, we began to counterattack, and our troops were to be upgraded to a field army. At this time, some comrades in the platoon had some ideological fluctuations, fearing that being in the field army would mean being far from home, and not knowing how hard and tiring life in the field army would be. Party members held group meetings to examine their own thinking. Everyone repeatedly thought through the principles and realized that the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army serve the people and seek liberation for the people. Being a soldier is not just for oneself to turn over and live a good life, but also to liberate all the people of China, so that they will no longer suffer and can live a good life. If we don't become a field army and don't fight out, how can we help all the suffering people of China turn over? Thinking like this, everyone knew that their past thinking was wrong, and they made mutual guarantees to resolutely fight out, expand the liberated areas, and liberate all of China. Then we held a platoon meeting. Party members first examined their own wrong thinking, and then told the comrades this principle. Everyone's understanding was also improved, and they all examined their own thinking. At this platoon meeting, everyone gave Yao Kuan some feedback. Yao Kuan was a peasant who had turned over, and because he wanted to ask for leave to go home, but the higher authorities did not approve it, he became emotional. Everyone said: "You are a peasant who has turned over, you have just been allocated land and a tiled house, and your family is living a good life. Isn't this the result of making revolution? Now Chiang Kai-shek won't let us live a good life and is attacking us, so we must actively defend the fruits of victory and fight him. We have turned over and are living a good life, we can't forget that there are still many people suffering! Now you don't think about where the tiled house and land came from, and you don't actively defend them, but you want to go home, do you think that's right?!" This made Yao Kuan understand in his heart, and he confessed on the spot that he had forgotten his roots, and expressed his determination to overcome his problems. In this way, everyone realized why being in the field army was glorious, and they all made plans to ensure that they would not have family thoughts, would not be afraid of hardship, and would go wherever the higher authorities directed them, always maintaining glory.

Our troops always conduct class education according to Chairman Mao's instructions, so that the comrades all follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao. In the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, our troops launched denunciations. Zhang Fuming's uncle was beaten to death by Japanese devils, and he himself was buried alive by the devils halfway, but he was shy and dared not say it. The platoon leader, Party members, and Youth League group leader chatted with him casually, guiding him to tell the facts of hatred and inspiring his hatred. After he denounced, everyone also denounced. We then discussed who caused these hatreds and what should be done? Everyone recognized that this was all caused by the Kuomintang reactionaries and imperialism. Today, American imperialism is invading Korea, arming Japan, and wants to inflict disaster on the Chinese people again. We resolutely refuse to do so, and we must practice our martial arts well and be ready to strike at the invaders at any time. After this denunciation, the comrades' awareness was further improved. Everyone realized that as long as imperialism exists in the world for one day, we must hold our guns tightly and be prepared to invade us at all times. Everyone further realized the correctness and importance of Chairman Mao's instruction that "the People's Liberation Army is always a fighting force."

It is in this way that under the leadership and education of the Party, our class consciousness has been improving day by day. The comrades all know that making revolution and being a People's Liberation Army soldier is for liberating the people, so that everyone can live a good life. The Party and Chairman Mao constantly educate us, so that we not only know what to do now, but also know what to do in the future. We thank the Party and Chairman Mao, who have made each of us a revolutionary fighter with lofty ideals.

	Using the weapon of criticism and self-criticism at any time
	Promoting the spirit of class love to strengthen combat determination

Our People's Liberation Army has many glorious traditions, and we attach great importance to our glorious traditions. What I said above is one of them. In addition, we in our platoon strive to maintain and carry forward democratic leadership style, following the mass line, unity and mutual assistance, class love... and other traditions. Since our platoon was established, we have changed six platoon leaders. Every platoon leader has carried forward these glorious traditions, cared for the soldiers, and inspired everyone's enthusiasm. The first platoon leader, Cao Deyuan, cared for and loved the soldiers, treating each comrade as if they were his own brothers. The second platoon leader, Comrade Bai Jingquan, developed Cao Deyuan's good style a step further. He not only cared for the comrades in life, but especially cared for the comrades ideologically. He usually paid close attention to what kind of thoughts the comrades had and what kind of developments and changes they had. When he discovered them, he quickly tried to help solve them. In this way, a good foundation was laid. Later, no matter which platoon leader was replaced, they all knew that there was such a good tradition in the platoon, and no one wanted to tarnish it, and everyone wanted to carry it forward and do the work better. In order to carry forward this glorious tradition, we pay attention to criticism and self-criticism at all times to improve everyone's shortcomings. These platoon leaders not only cared for the soldiers in peacetime, but also cared for them more in battle, paying close attention to loving the soldiers on the battlefield. During the Battle of Taiyuan, Platoon Leader Wang Jiaxi patiently told everyone how to eliminate the enemy and conceal themselves. He also dug a shell shelter for the soldier Zhang Jinbo and told him to hide first, and then dig his own. In the Yinxian battle in 1946, Platoon Leader Jing Yuxiu disregarded his own life and death, breaking through the enemy's encirclement three times to rescue the new soldier Yang Guimao who had not withdrawn. In our platoon, the platoon leader cares for the soldiers, and the comrades also care for the platoon leader. Everyone helps each other. If anyone has difficulties, everyone helps him solve them. If anyone has something that he can't figure out in his mind, everyone also helps each other solve it. Party members unite the masses and educate the masses. You help me, I help you, it's really a revolutionary family!

	Promoting the exemplary role of Communist Party members
	Proposing a heroism competition to the unit

The situation in our platoon is roughly like this. In these six years, under the education of the Communist Party, everyone's class consciousness has been improved, we have completed the various tasks given to us by the Party and higher authorities, and we have received many glorious titles. Today, while celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Communist Party of China, we are very happy, and we feel that these glories are given to us by the Party and Chairman Mao. Therefore, we all especially love the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. When all the comrades in our platoon were discussing how to welcome the 30th anniversary of the Party, everyone cherished this glory very much and were determined to maintain this glory and further develop this glory. Now we have responded to the call of the higher Party committee to strive to create a model unit of unity and consolidation. After discussion by all the comrades in our platoon, in the great anti-US aggression and aid Korea movement of the motherland, we have proposed a patriotic revolutionary heroism competition to our unit.

Our platoon is a young platoon in the People's Liberation Army. We know that many platoons in fraternal units are doing even better than us, and they have more good experiences. We hope that the comrades in the troops across the country can give us more advice and instructions through newspapers, radio, and writing letters. Introduce your valuable experience. We are determined to humbly learn from our elder brothers and make our platoon better!

　　“光荣是党和毛主席给我们的！”
     ——人民解放军某部模范班党的小组长郑守发为纪念党的三十周年向党中央和毛主席所作的报告——
    我是人民解放军某部一连大功第四班的副班长，也是党的小组长，我叫郑守发。我们四班是人民解放军里一个普通的班，跟别的部队的班一样。我们班自从一九四五年七月成立那天，到现在整整六年，没有发生过非战斗减员。我们全班同志都很高兴，都觉着很光荣，都说：“这个光荣是毛主席给我们的，是党和上级领导的正确。”今天为了迎接党的三十周年纪念，我在这里向党中央、毛主席和全国人民报告报告我们班的工作。
    我们班刚成立的时候，还是地方支队，后来发展壮大了，才升编为地方主力部队，以后又升编为野战军，我们班从一九四六年开始作战起，打过十三次攻坚战，六次追击战，曾经两次西征绥远，参加过保（定）南、保北、平张及太原好几个大战役。华北解放以后，我们部队又展开了练兵、生产，担当起了保卫国防的光荣任务。直到现在六年整，发扬了我们人民解放军团结巩固的光荣传统，班里没有发生过一个逃亡，没有一个得病送到医院去的。从一九四六年解放战争以来，在无数次的大小战斗中，完成了许多重要的任务，得过上级好几次奖励，但是从来没有一个伤亡。我们班仅在太原战役中，曾经俘虏二十九个敌人，缴获轻机枪两挺、小炮两门、步枪十多枝。练兵的时候，我们班得过巩固部队“模范堡垒大功班”的奖旗；生产的时候，我们班得过“生产模范班”的称号。从我们班里前后提升出去三个连级干部，五个排级干部，十一个班长。有十四个同志光荣地参加了共产党，有两名参加了青年团。在这么长的时间里，班长和老战士不断地提升、调走，新成份也不断地补充进来，可是我们班却一直是团结巩固的。我们全班同志一直继承着和发展着这个光荣传统。
            经常进行共产党和阶级的教育
            党小组帮助大家提高思想水平
    人民解放军是人民的军队。战士们都是在旧社会里受压迫的人，自觉自愿地参加了军队干革命的。我们的部队有共产党的正确领导，是按着毛主席的军事思想和指示来建军的，所以打不垮，拖不烂。我们四班也是这样。自从建班到现在，党和上级不断地教育我们说：咱们的部队是人民的军队，是全心全意为人民服务，为人民求解放的部队，同志们一块干革命，都是阶级弟兄，比亲兄弟还亲，大家要发扬阶级友爱，团结进步，来完成人民给我们的任务。我们就这样作了。不论什么时候，大伙总是一条心一个劲的干。可是因为同志们多是农民出身，有时候看事看不远，也有些错误的想法。这时候上级和党的支部马上就给我们指出来，使我们很快的改过。我们班里党的小组也特别注意同志们的思想活动，发现了问题，小组里先开会研究，先在党内把思想搞通了，认识一样了，再去解决，党员们平时也能主动的帮助群众解决问题，起骨干作用。
    我们班党的小组帮助同志们解决思想问题，也没有什么特别窍门，只有一条，就是：讲清革命道理，启发阶级觉悟。比如一九四七年冬天，我们开始反攻了，我们的部队要升编为野战军。这时候班里有的同志思想上有些波动，怕当野战军离家远，不知道野战军生活有多苦，有多累。党员就开小组会检讨自己的思想，大家翻来覆去地把道理想通了，认识到共产党和解放军是为人民服务，为人民求解放的，当兵也不是光为自己翻身过好日子，还要解放全中国的老百姓，都不再受苦，都过好日子。如果不当野战军，不打出去，怎么能帮助全中国的受苦人翻身呢？这样一想，都知道自己过去的思想错了，便互相提出保证，坚决打出去，扩大解放区，解放全中国。接着我们又开了个班务会，党员们先把自己的错误思想检讨了，再把这个道理向同志一说，大家的认识也提高了，全都检讨了自己的思想。在这次班务会上，大家给姚宽提了意见。姚宽是个翻身农民，因为想请假回家，上级没批准，就闹起情绪来。大家都说：“你是个翻身农民，刚刚分了水地，分了瓦房，家里过上了好日子，这还不是干革命得来的？现在蒋介石不让咱过好日子，打咱们来了，咱们就得积极保卫胜利果实，跟他干。咱们翻了身，过了好日子，不能忘了有好多老百姓还受苦哩！你现在不想想瓦房水地是怎么来的，不积极保卫他，反倒想回家，你想想对吗？！”说得姚宽心里明白过来，当场检讨自己是忘了本，表示要下决心克服。这么一来，大家都认识到当野战军为什么是光荣的，便都订了计划，保证不闹家庭观念，不怕苦，上级指到那打到那，永远保持光荣。
    我们部队总是根据毛主席的指示，进行阶级教育，使同志们都按着毛主席指示的道路走。在抗美援朝运动中，我们部队展开了控诉。班里张福明的大爷被日本鬼子打死，自己被鬼子活埋过半截，可是他怕羞，不敢说。班长、党员、团小组长就跟他闲扯，引导他讲出了仇恨事实，启发了他的仇恨心。他控诉了以后，大家也都控诉起来。我们接着就讨论这些仇恨是谁给的，该怎么办？大家认清这都是国民党反动派和帝国主义给的，今天美帝国主义侵略朝鲜，武装日本，又想叫咱中国人民再受祸害，我们坚决不干，一定要好好练武，随时准备打击侵略者。从这回控诉后，同志们的觉悟又提高了一步，大家都认清了世界上有帝国主义存在一天，我们就得握紧枪杆子，时时刻刻防备它来侵略我们。大家更进一步地体会到毛主席指示的“人民解放军永远是个战斗队”的正确和重要。
    我们就是这样在党的领导和教育下，阶级觉悟一天一天地提高了。同志们都知道干革命，当解放军，就是为解放人民，就是叫人人都能过好日子。党和毛主席不断地教育我们，使我们不光知道眼前要干什么，也知道将来要干什么。我们感谢党和毛主席，他使我们每个同志都成了有远大理想的革命战士。
            随时运用批评与自我批评武器
        发扬阶级友爱精神加强战斗决心
    我们人民解放军有很多光荣传统，我们很重视我们的光荣传统。上边我说的就是里边的一个。另外像领导作风上发扬民主，走群众路线，团结互助，阶级友爱……等等，我们班努力的保持并且发扬了这些传统。我们班从建班以来，前后换了六个班长。每一个班长都发扬了这些光荣传统，都很关心战士，启发大家的积极性。第一任班长曹德元，关心战士，爱护战士，对待每个同志，就像对待自己亲兄弟一样。第二任班长白净全同志把曹德元的好作风又发展了一步。他不光在生活上关心同志，特别是在思想上关心同志，他平常很注意同志们产生了什么样的思想，有了什么样的发展变化。发现了以后，就赶紧想办法帮助解决。这么一来，好底子就打下来了。以后不论换了那个班长，都知道班里有这么个好传统，谁也不愿沾辱了它，谁也想发扬它，把工作作得更好。为了发扬这种光荣传统，我们随时注意批评与自我批评，改进大家的缺点。这几位班长，不光平时关心战士，打起仗来更加关心，很注意战场上爱兵。打太原的时候，班长王甲喜先耐心地告诉大家消灭敌人隐蔽自己的方法。并且给战士张金波挖好了避弹壕告诉他先隐蔽起来，然后再挖自己的。一九四六年阴县战斗中，班长靖玉秀不顾自己生死，三次冲破敌人的包围，把没有撤下来的新战士杨贵毛救出来。我们班里，班长关心战士，同志们也关心班长，大家互相帮助，谁有了困难大家就帮助他解决，谁思想上有事想不通，大家也互相帮助解决，党员们团结群众，教育群众，你帮我，我帮你真是一个革命大家庭！
            发扬共产党员的模范作用
        向本部队提出英雄主义竞赛
    我们班的情况大致上就是这样。这六年来，我们班在共产党的教育下，大家的阶级觉悟提高了，完成了党和上级给我们的各种任务，得到不少光荣称号。今天，在庆祝中国共产党三十周年的时候，我们非常高兴，我们觉着这些光荣是党和毛主席给我们的。因此，我们大家特别热爱共产党，毛主席。我们全班同志在讨论迎接党的三十周年的时候，大家都很爱惜这个光荣，都下决心要保持这个光荣，进一步地发扬这个光荣。现在我们已经响应了上级党委关于争取创造团结巩固模范单位的号召，我们全班同志经过讨论，在祖国人民伟大的抗美援朝运动中，已经向我们本部队，提出了爱国主义的革命英雄主义竞赛。
    我们的班在人民解放军里，是一个年轻的班，我们知道很多兄弟部队的班，比我们搞的还好，他们有更多好的经验。我们希望全国部队的同志们，能通过报纸、广播、写信，多多给我们提意见，给我们指示。介绍你们宝贵的经验。我们有决心向老大哥们虚心学习，把我们的班搞得更好些！
                                                六月二十六日
