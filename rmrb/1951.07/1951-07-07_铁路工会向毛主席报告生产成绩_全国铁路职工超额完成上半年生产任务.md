　　Railway Union Reports Production Achievements to Chairman Mao
　　National Railway Workers Exceed Half-Year Production Target
　　The National Committee of the Railway Union of China, on June 30th, wrote to Chairman Mao, reporting that national railway workers had overfulfilled the state's transportation tasks for the first half of the year two days ahead of schedule. At the same time, the track-laying work for newly built railways has also completed 528 kilometers.
　　The original text of the letter from the National Committee of the Railway Union of China to Chairman Mao is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:
　　We, representing 540,000 railway workers and staff across the country, celebrate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China with extremely warm and joyful hearts, and extend our heartfelt congratulations and lofty salute to you and the Central Committee of the Party.
　　Since the "February 7th" strike in 1923, railway workers across the country have been waging unyielding struggles against imperialism and its running dog feudal warlords under your wise and correct leadership. When the People's Liberation War progressed victoriously, railway workers across the country enthusiastically responded to the call of you and the Central Committee of the Party: "Wherever the People's Liberation Army fights, the railway will be built," which powerfully supported the advance of the People's Liberation Army. After the basic victory of the country and the establishment of the Central People's Government, railway workers across the country responded to the call of you and the Central Committee of the Party, completing the state's transportation tasks for 1950 twenty-one days ahead of schedule, making a good start for the country to embark on economic construction. This year, railway workers across the country all know that it is the 30th anniversary of the founding of their Party, and in order to celebrate the Party's birthday – the great "July 1st," they have once again displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm. On the operational lines, they completed 101.5% of the transportation tasks for the first half of 1951 on June 28th, ahead of schedule. In the first half of the year, 528 kilometers of track-laying work were completed on the new line construction projects such as Lai-Zhen, Chengdu-Chongqing, Baoji-Tianshui, Tianshui-Lanzhou, and Beitongpu, as well as nearly 30,000 cubic meters of earth and stone work and bridge and culvert projects. This is a major event that railway workers across the country feel excited about and proud of. Now we hereby report to you and the Central Committee of the Party as a gift from railway workers across the country to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the founding of their Party.
　　For the needs of national economic construction and national defense construction, the state has increased the new task of railway transportation by 20% in June, and the new line projects are also required to be carried out more rapidly. On the occasion of celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Party's birth, we, on behalf of the railway workers, assure you and the Central Committee of the Party: We will definitely, under your and the Party Central Committee's wise and correct leadership, more loyally study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, enhance our class consciousness, strive to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, improve our technical level, strive to study culture, improve our cultural literacy, and concentrate our efforts to complete the state's overall railway transportation tasks for 1951, and strive to further exert the great support role of railways in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea. Strive to consolidate the national defense of our great motherland and defend peace in Asia and the world.
　　This year's railway transportation task, including the newly added ones, is very arduous. We know that due to the wise and correct leadership of you and the Central Committee of the Party, all the objective conditions for completing the task are fully available. As long as the subjective efforts of the railway workers across the country are consistent, we will definitely be able to complete and strive to overfulfill the task.
　　Today, we present the completion of the transportation task for the first half of the year two days ahead of schedule as a gift to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Party's birth. When 1952 comes, we will definitely congratulate you and the Central Committee of the Party with the completion of the state's annual transportation task ahead of schedule.
　　We shout: Long live the People's Republic of China! Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live Chairman Mao!
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　National Committee of the Railway Union of China

    我们代表全国五十四万铁路工人和职员，以非常热烈而愉快的心情庆祝中国共产党诞生的三十周年纪念日，并向您及党中央委员会致衷心的祝贺与崇高的敬礼。
    全国铁路工人自一九二三年“二七”以来，就一直在您的英明正确领导下，向帝国主义及其走狗封建军阀们进行着不屈不挠的斗争。当人民解放战争胜利地进展的时候，全国铁路工人热烈地响应了您和党中央的号召：“解放军打到那里，铁路修到那里”，曾有力地支援了人民解放大军的前进。当全国基本胜利，中央人民政府成立后，全国铁路工人又响应了您和党中央的号召，提前二十一天完成了一九五○年的国家运输任务，为国家走上经济建设作了良好的开端。今年，全国铁路工人都知道是自己的党建党的第三十周年，为了庆祝党的诞辰——伟大的“七一”，又发挥了高度的劳动热情，在通车线路上，于六月二十八日提前完成了一九五一年上半年运输任务的百分之一百点五。在来镇、成渝、宝天、天兰和北同蒲等新线修建工程上半年内完成了五二八公里铺轨工程，近三万方土石方和桥梁水道工程。这是全国铁路工人感到兴奋并引为光荣的一件大事，现在我们谨向您和党中央报告，作为全国铁路工人庆祝自己的党建党三十周年的献礼。
    国家为了经济建设和国防建设的需要，六月份又增加铁路运输的新任务百分之二十，新线工程也要求更加迅速进行。在庆祝党诞生的三十周年的时候，我们代表铁路工人向您和党中央保证：我们一定更忠诚地在您和党中央英明正确的领导下，努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，提高我们的阶级觉悟，努力学习苏联先进经验，提高我们的技术水平，努力学习文化，提高我们的文化素养，并集中力量完成国家给予我们的一九五一年全年铁路运输总任务而奋斗，为更加发挥铁路在抗美援朝运动中的伟大支援作用而奋斗。为巩固我们伟大祖国的国防，保卫亚洲和世界的和平而奋斗。
    今年的铁路运输任务，连同新增加的，是十分艰巨的，我们知道，由于您和党中央英明正确的领导下，所有完成任务的客观条件是完全具备的，只要全国铁路工人主观的一致努力，就一定能够完成并争取超过完成。
    今天我们以提前二天完成上半年运输任务作为庆祝党诞生的三十周年的献礼，一九五二年来临的时候，我们定将以提前完成国家全年运输任务向您和党中央贺年。
    我们高呼：中华人民共和国万岁！中国共产党万岁！毛主席万岁！
                      中国铁路工会全国委员会
