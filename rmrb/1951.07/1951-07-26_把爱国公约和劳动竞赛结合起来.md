　　Combine Patriotic Pledges and Labor Emulation

Recently, some factory workers have begun to establish patriotic emulation pledges. This is a good way for the workers to consciously combine the content of patriotic pledges with the conditions of labor emulation. The benefit is that, on the one hand, it can effectively overcome the problems of patriotic pledges being empty, trivial, and existing only in name; on the other hand, it can enrich the political content of labor emulation and avoid the ideas of championism and participating in the competition solely for the sake of bonuses. This is a driving force for the continuous advancement of labor emulation and an effective method for regularizing patriotic pledges. However, when combining the two, the following issues should be noted: (1) The political significance and role of the patriotic pledge should not be reduced. One should not simply slightly change the original competition conditions or leave them unchanged, rename it a "Patriotic Emulation Pledge," but should truly combine the political requirements of labor emulation with the specific goals of labor emulation in production and work. (2) The content of the competition should not be generalized. One should not write a few political slogans just because the name is a "pledge" rather than "competition conditions," or only care about appearances and make everything seem complete; instead, one should focus on the most important current problems in production or work in one's own small unit and the main problems hindering production improvement in each period, and set out effective solutions and specific goals. (3) The units signing the pledge should not be too large, and the period should not be too long. When promoting such patriotic emulation pledges, on the one hand, attention should be paid to cultivating advanced groups and establishing concrete examples, and on the other hand, attention should be paid to the balanced development between groups, so that the pledge can truly mobilize everyone to participate in labor emulation based on patriotism. Within the group, it is also necessary for each person to make a production plan, but it must be consistent with the group's common plan. In addition to the group pledge, it is also necessary to establish pledges in a larger scope (such as workshops, sections, departments) and the entire factory, so that everyone has a more concentrated goal and a consistent direction, but these should be based on the group pledge.

In June this year, the Chinese People's Committee for Resisting America and Aiding Korea issued a call for the promotion of patriotic pledges: "We suggest carrying out competition movements to realize patriotic pledges among signing units with similar characteristics. And in January next year, universally check the results of this patriotic competition, evaluate the merits and demerits, and reward models to ensure that the pledges everyone has made can be fully realized." Establishing and implementing patriotic emulation pledges is the most appropriate way to realize this call.

### 把爱国公约和劳动竞赛结合起来

　　把爱国公约和劳动竞赛结合起来
    最近，有些工厂的职工开始订立爱国竞赛公约。这是职工群众自觉地把爱国公约和劳动竞赛条件结合起来的良好的形式。它的好处是，一方面可以有效地克服爱国公约内容空泛、琐碎、有名无实等毛病；一方面可以充实劳动竞赛的政治内容，避免发生锦标主义和单纯为了得奖金而参加竞赛的思想。这是使劳动竞赛不断前进的推动力，也是使爱国公约经常化的有效方法。但在把两者结合起来的时候，应该注意下面几个问题：（一）不应降低爱国公约的政治意义和作用，不应该只把原来的竞赛条件稍为变动一下或原封不动，改个名字叫做“爱国竞赛公约”，而应该真正把劳动竞赛的政治要求和劳动竞赛在生产上和工作上的具体目标结合起来。（二）不应把竞赛内容一般化。不应该因为名称是“公约”而不是“竞赛条件”，就写上几条政治口号，或者只顾表面，弄得样样齐全；而要针对每一时期自己这个小单位生产上或工作中当前最重要的问题和阻碍生产改进的主要问题，定出有效的解决办法和具体的奋斗目标。（三）订约的单位不应太大，时期不宜太长。在推行这样的爱国竞赛公约时，一方面要注意培养先进小组，树立具体的榜样，一方面要注意组与组间的平衡发展，使公约真正能把每一个人动员到以爱国主义为基础的劳动竞赛中来。在小组内，每个人订立生产计划也是必要的，但也必须与本小组的共同计划一致。除小组公约之外，订立较大范围（如车间、工段、部门）及全厂的公约也是必要的，可以使大家有更集中的目标和一致的方向，但这些都要以小组公约为基础。
    中国人民抗美援朝总会今年六月关于推行爱国公约的号召中说：“我们建议在性质相近的订约单位间，开展实现爱国公约的竞赛运动。并于明年一月普遍检查这种爱国竞赛的结果，评定优劣，奖励模范，以保证大家所订立的公约能够圆满地实现。”订立与实行爱国竞赛公约就是实现这一号召的最适当的形式。
