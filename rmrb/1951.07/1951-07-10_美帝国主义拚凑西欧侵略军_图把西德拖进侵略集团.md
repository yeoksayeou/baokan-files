Xinhua News Agency, July 7th—U.S. and British imperialism's steps to rearm West Germany have intensified further after manipulating the French elections and causing the breakdown of the Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' meeting. On this point, the British *Manchester Guardian* shamelessly and openly said: "Now that Gromyko has returned home and the French elections are over, one can expect the matter of rearmament to emerge."

Currently, two secret meetings, which began several months ago to plan how to arm West Germany and drag it into the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, have concluded, and both meetings have put forward sinister plans.

The first of the two meetings was held in Petersberg, Bonn, from January this year by military experts from the U.S., Britain, and France, along with Adenauer's military experts—former Hitlerite generals Speidel and Heusinger. This meeting drafted a report in mid-June to be submitted to the governments of the U.S., Britain, and France. According to a June 26th United Press dispatch from London, the report recommends that West Germany should initially provide a total of approximately 250,000 troops to the proposed North Atlantic army and establish an air force. West German military personnel would "participate in the work of the command headquarters, or even in the operational departments of the general headquarters." Furthermore, according to the Dutch *Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant*, the most important content of the report is to give West Germany privileges in the matter of West European military build-up. The newspaper said: The discussion at the meeting was not about West Germany's "equality" in the amount and scale of rearmament, but about its "priority" in this regard.

The second meeting was the so-called "European Army Conference" held in Paris from February this year by the governments of France, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the West German puppet government. This meeting was initiated by France, with the aim of proposing a plan to incorporate West German troops into the so-called "European Army" in smaller units, thereby avoiding the establishment of West German divisions and a West German General Staff Headquarters as originally demanded by the United States, in order to alleviate popular opposition. However, according to a June 29th Agence France-Presse dispatch from Paris, during the course of the meeting, France has abandoned the so-called "Pleven Plan," which only allowed the establishment of 6,000-man German "battle groups," and agreed that German troops would join the European Army in larger units. The meeting has "seemingly taken for granted" that "the basic unit will be larger and will have at least 10,000 men." Therefore, the meeting "no longer disputes the principle of German participation (in the North Atlantic Army)." The meeting is scheduled to submit a so-called "interim report" to the relevant governments on July 10th. The *New York Times* quoted "authoritative sources" in Paris on June 26th to explain that the upcoming meeting report will include this "concession" from France.

Now, the aforementioned two reports will be submitted together to Washington for "study" and "comparison" by the U.S. government in order to make a decision. Moscow *Pravda* commentator Viktorov, in commenting on this event, pointed out: The results of the secret negotiations have clearly shown that the U.S. imperialists are constantly realizing their plan to organize the armed forces of the Atlantic aggressive bloc. This plan not only cobbles together the aggressive army, but also, with the hypocritical posture of "common defense," completely buries the national sovereignty of the West European countries, turning them into obedient cannon fodder suppliers. The results of these negotiations have inflicted new damage on the national interests of Britain and France.

### 美帝国主义拚凑西欧侵略军  图把西德拖进侵略集团

　　美帝国主义拚凑西欧侵略军
    图把西德拖进侵略集团
    【新华社七日讯】美英帝国主义重新武装西德的步骤在操纵法国大选和使四国外长助理会议破裂以后，已更形加紧。关于这一点，英国《曼彻斯特卫报》曾无耻地公然说：“现在葛罗米柯已经回国，法国大选已经结束，人们可以指望重整军备的事情出现了。”
    目前，在几个月以前就开始策划如何武装西德和把西德拖入北大西洋侵略集团的两个秘密会议，都已告一段落，两个会议都提出了罪恶的计划。
    两个会议中的第一个，是美、英、法三国军事专家与阿登纳的军事专家——前希特勒将领斯派达尔和豪辛格，从今年一月起在波恩彼得斯堡举行的会议。这个会议已在六月中旬拟出提交美英法三国政府的报告。据合众社伦敦六月二十六日电透露：这个报告建议，西德应向拟议中的北大西洋军队初步提供总数约二十五万人的军队并建立空军，西德军人得“参加司令部的工作，甚或参加总司令部作战部门的工作”。此外，据荷兰“新鹿特丹报”透露，报告最重要的内容是要在西欧整军备战的问题上，给西德以特权。该报说：会议所讨论的，不是西德在重整军备的多寡和规模上“平等”的问题，而是它在这一方面的“优先权”的问题。
    第二个会议是法国、意大利、比利时和卢森堡四国政府和西德傀儡政府从今年二月起在巴黎举行的所谓“欧洲军会议”。这个会议是法国发起的，其目的在于提出一种方案，把西德军队以较小的单位编入所谓“欧洲军”内，而避免建立美国原来所要求建立的西德师团和西德参谋总部，以此缓和人民的反对。但是，据法新社巴黎六月二十九日电称：在会议过程中，法国已放弃了关于只准建立六千人的德国“战斗队”的所谓“普利文计划”，而同意德国军队以更大的单位加入欧洲军。会议对“基本单位将较大，且至少有一万人”，已经“似乎是认为当然的”了。因此，会议“对于德国参加（北大西洋军）的原则，已经不再有所争论了”。会议已定于七月十日向各有关政府提出所谓“临时报告”。《纽约时报》六月二十六日引用巴黎“权威人士”的谈话说明，即将提出的会议报告中，将包含有法国的这种“让步”。
    现在，上述两个报告将一同提交华盛顿，由美国政府来进行“研究”和“比较”，以便作出决定。莫斯科《真理报》评论家维克托罗夫在评论这一事件时指出：秘密谈判的结果已经很清楚地表明，美帝国主义者正在不断地实现他们的组织大西洋侵略集团的武装力量的计划。这一个计划不但把侵略军拚凑在一起，并且用“共同防务”的虚伪的姿态，把西欧各国的国家主权全部埋葬，把它们变成唯命是听的炮灰供应者。这些谈判的结果，对英法两国的国家利益给与了新的损害。
