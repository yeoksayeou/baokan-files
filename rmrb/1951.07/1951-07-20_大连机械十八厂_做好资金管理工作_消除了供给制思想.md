　　Dalian Machinery No. 18 Factory
　　Does a Good Job in Capital Management
　　Eliminates the Idea of the Supply System
    Since Dalian Machinery No. 18 Factory began independent economic activities in August of last year, it has initially dispelled the idea of the supply system among cadres and attached importance to capital management. As a result, it has been able to flexibly circulate capital with a relatively small amount of working capital, without borrowing from the bank. Furthermore, it has been able to turn over to the leadership organs over 100 million yuan of surplus working capital from the factory.
    The factory has achieved these results in capital management mainly by paying attention to three key points: rationally storing raw materials, shortening the production cycle, and accelerating the circulation process.
    In terms of raw material reserves: Because of the prevalence of the supply system mentality among cadres in the past, there were erroneous ideas such as "the more inventory, the better," "convenient to use," and "better safe than sorry." Since the implementation of independent accounting, it has been recognized that excessive raw material reserves will affect capital turnover. Therefore, the warehouse was promptly cleaned up, and all raw materials that were temporarily not needed or would not be needed in the future were handed over to the leadership organs for disposal, thereby freeing up stagnant capital. When making raw material plans, the existing inventory situation should be considered to see if there are any raw materials that can be substituted. For example, sometimes smaller round iron is needed, but it is not easy to buy on the market, while the warehouse has large round iron that is temporarily not needed. It was decided to forge the large round iron into smaller round iron for substitution. The reserve amount of raw materials is also stipulated to be no more than one month's usage. Each time raw materials are purchased, a sample must first be taken to the factory for testing and opinions must be solicited from relevant departments. After everyone agrees that it can be used, it is purchased to avoid buying things that cannot be used and accumulating capital. In the past, the "scrap heads" cut off when blacksmiths forged iron were considered waste and no one used them; now, the material staff often checks to see if these "scrap heads" can still be used. In short, every possible way is found to use internal resources, prevent capital outflow, and prevent inventory accumulation.
    Shortening the production cycle is a very important issue. In the past, many cadres did not pay attention to this point. When receiving a batch of tasks, many people wanted to produce them all at once, thinking that such mass production could improve the workers' technical operation skills and ensure the completion of the task, but they did not consider that a long production cycle would accumulate capital and be detrimental to the country. Therefore, when manufacturing the second batch of eight-foot lathes, it was decided to manufacture them in two batches, shortening the production cycle and making one yuan of capital work as two yuan. During the production period, the production department strictly controlled the production progress to prevent the production of each workshop from being disjointed and extending the production cycle. For example, when making six-foot lathes last year, a boring machine was initially used to bore the headstock eyes. Later, it was found that one machine was too busy and would affect the fitter's assembly work. A lathe was added in time to help with the boring, solving this difficulty.
    Do a good job in product sales. Accelerate the circulation process. In order to ensure that goods are sold smoothly, they must be "high quality and low price." On this point, because the factory leadership has always attached importance to product quality and adopted many methods to improve quality, the quality of its products can initially meet the needs of users under the existing conditions. Especially because the leadership has clarified the policy of "unqualified products must not be sold externally," the product quality has established a high reputation among users. Because the factory management work is becoming more correct and reasonable, the use of raw materials is moderate, the machinery and equipment are fully utilized, and the workers have demonstrated patriotic labor enthusiasm, improving production efficiency. This has resulted in a significant reduction in costs and an increase in national wealth. Comrade Wang Zhaoda, a worker who makes lead screws, planned to spend 1070 minutes for each lead screw in the first batch, but actually only spent 840 minutes; the planned time for the second batch was 760 minutes, but the actual average was only 630 minutes. When the factory manufactured single-back six-foot lathes, the cost of the second batch of products was 35 percent lower than the cost of the first batch.

### 大连机械十八厂  做好资金管理工作  消除了供给制思想

　　大连机械十八厂
　  做好资金管理工作
　  消除了供给制思想
    大连机械十八厂从去年八月份进行独立的经济活动以来，在干部中初步打消了供给制的思想，重视了资金管理工作，因而能在流动资金并不宽余的情况下，使资金灵活周转，没有向银行贷款，并且，能上缴上亿元的工厂所富余的流动资金。
    该厂所以能在资金管理工作上做出这些成绩来，主要是注意了资金管理工作中的三个要点，即合理地储备原材料；缩短生产周期；加速流通过程。
    在原材料储备方面：因为过去干部的供给制思想作怪，也就产生了“库存愈多愈好”；“使用方便”，“有备无患”等错误思想。自从实行独立会计后，已认识到原材料储备多了就要影响资金的周转，所以及时地清理了仓库，将库存的暂时用不着或者将来仍用不着的原材料，全部交领导机关处理完毕，从而解放了呆滞的资金。作原材料计划时，也要根据库存的情况，考虑是否有可以代用的原材料。如有时需要较小的圆铁，市场上不易买到，而仓库存有暂时用不着的大圆铁，就决定把大圆铁锻造成小圆铁来代用。原材料的储备量也规定了最多不超过一个月的使用量。每次采购原材料时首先要拿一点样品到工厂进行试验，并征求有关部门的意见，在大家都认为可以使用之后，再购买回来，免得买到厂里来不能用而积压了资金。过去铁工间打铁时裁下来的“残料头”就成了废料，没人使用；现在材料员经常去看这些“残料头”是不是还可以利用。总之：想出一切办法来动用内部资材，不使资金外流，不使库存积压。
    缩短生产周期是个很重要的问题。过去很多干部没重视这一点。每接到一批任务时，很多人都想一次制作出来，认为这样大批生产，可以提高工人的技术操作熟练程度，对完成任务有把握，但没考虑到生产周期长了，就会积压资金，对国家不利。所以在制造第二批八英尺车床时，就决定分两批制造，缩短了生产的周期，使一块钱的资金能当两块钱用。在生产期间，生产科严格掌握生产进度，不使各车间生产脱节而延长了生产周期。如去年做六英尺车床时，当初是用一台床子搪床头眼，后来发现一台床子忙不开，要影响钳工装配工作，就及时增设一台车床帮助搪，解决了这一困难。
    做好产品推销工作。加速流通过程，要想货物畅销无阻，就必须做到“物美价廉”，关于这一点，因为该厂领导上一向重视产品质量，并采用了许多提高质量的办法，所以使所出的产品的质量，在现有的条件下，尚能初步满足用户的要求；尤其是因为领导上明确了“不合格的产品，一律不向外推销”的方针，所以使产品质量在用户中建立了很高的信誉。由于工厂管理工作日趋正确合理，原材料使用适度和机器设备的充分运用又由于工人发挥了爱国主义劳动热忱，提高了生产效率，这样就使得成本显著降低，增加了国家财富。做丝杠的王兆达工友在车第一批丝杠时，每根计划时间是一○七○分钟，实际只用八四○分钟；第二批的计划时间是七六○分钟，实际平均只用六三○分钟。该厂制造单背式的六英尺床子时，第二批产品的成本就比第一批产品成本降低了百分之三十五。
