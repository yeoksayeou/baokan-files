  　Village Cadres in Hongkou Village, Muping County, Shandong Province
　  Interfere with Freedom of Marriage, Forcing People to Death
　  Muping County People's Government Should Immediately Investigate and Deal with It
    Village cadres in Hongkou Village, 16th District, Muping County, Shandong Province, interfered with freedom of marriage, forcing people to death. The Muping County Democratic Women's Federation has suggested that the County People's Government handle this matter.
    Young people Yang Shuhu (male) and Yang Xianling (female) from Hongkou Village often worked together in production, developed feelings for each other, and began a romantic relationship. Village cadre Yang Xiuding believed that they had the same surname and the generations were not right, so they could not be in love, saying they were messing around. On June 25th, he convened a village militia meeting to criticize Yang Shuhu (Qu Ridong, a cadre of the District People's Government, also attended the meeting and did not stop it). After being criticized, Yang Shuhu went back and fell ill. On June 27th, the village convened another meeting of militia, women, and youth, presided over by Yang Pijuan, the secretary of the village Communist Youth League branch, to criticize Yang Xianling, demanding that she admit to having physical relations with Yang Shuhu. Yang Xianling firmly denied it. Village cadre Yang Xiuding said, "We will continue to hold a meeting to criticize you tomorrow (but it didn't happen), to see if you admit it or not." Because Yang Shuhu was criticized and became ill, the village cadres decided to fine Yang Xianling by making her harvest wheat for Yang Shuhu, and said that if Yang Shuhu died, Yang Xianling would be fully responsible.
    After being criticized, Yang Xianling and Yang Shuhu went together to the District People's Government (located in the village) to register their marriage, but no one was there. Later, Yang Xianling's father went to the District People's Government to find civil affairs assistant Huang Baoxu, asking him to deal with his daughter's problem; but Huang Baoxu ignored him. Because her problem could not be resolved, Yang Xianling felt very depressed and committed suicide by hanging herself on the morning of July 10th. Yang Shuhu was stimulated by this and his illness worsened, and now his life is also in danger.
    After learning about this matter, the Muping County Democratic Women's Federation immediately sent people to the village to investigate, and suggested that the Muping County People's Government give the law-breaking village cadre Yang Xiuding and others who interfered with freedom of marriage and forced people to death the punishment they deserve. We believe that the 16th District People's Government of Muping County, stationed in the village, should also be responsible for this incident, as it did not stop the village cadres' illegal behavior beforehand, nor did it inquire about it afterward. We suggest that the Muping County People's Government investigate the responsibility and give appropriate punishment.

  　山东牟平县洪口村村干部
　  干涉婚姻自由逼死人命
　  牟平县人民政府应即调查处理
    山东省牟平县第十六区洪口村村干部干涉婚姻自由，逼死人命。牟平县民主妇女联合会已建议该县人民政府对此进行处理。
    洪口村青年杨书胡（男）、杨宪令（女）两人，经常在一起生产，就发生感情，进行恋爱。该村村干部杨秀丁认为他们俩人同姓，辈份不对，不能恋爱，说他们是胡搞。六月二十五日，他召开了该村民兵会斗争杨书胡（区人民政府干部曲日东也参加了这个会，对此竟不加制止）。杨书胡被斗争后，回去就病了。六月二十七日，该村又召集民兵、妇女、青年开会，由该村青年团支部书记杨丕娟掌握，对杨宪令进行斗争，要她承认和杨书胡发生肉体关系。杨宪令坚决否认。村干部杨秀丁说：“明天继续开会斗争你（结果没有开），看你承认不承认。”因为杨书胡被斗争得病了，村干部们就决定要罚杨宪令给杨书胡代拔麦子，并说如果杨书胡病死了，要杨宪令负全责。
    杨宪令被斗争后，曾和杨书胡同到区人民政府（驻在该村）去登记结婚，但区人民政府却没有人在。后来杨宪令的父亲又到区人民政府找民政助理员黄保绪，要求处理他女儿这个问题；而黄保绪竟置之不理。杨宪令因为她的问题得不到解决，心里很苦闷，就在七月十日上午上吊自杀了。杨书胡受此刺激，病势加重，现在生命也很危险。
    牟平县民主妇女联合会知道这个事情后，当即派人到该村进行了调查，并建议牟平县人民政府给干涉婚姻自由、逼死人命的违法村干部杨秀丁等以应得处分。我们认为牟平县第十六区人民政府驻在该村，对村干部违法行为事前既不制止，事后亦不过问，对这个事件也应负责。我们建议牟平县人民政府查清责任，给以适当处理。
