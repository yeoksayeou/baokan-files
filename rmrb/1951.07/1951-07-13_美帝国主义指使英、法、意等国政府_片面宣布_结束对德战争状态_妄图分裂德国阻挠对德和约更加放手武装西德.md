　　Xinhua News Agency, 12th. Under the direction of U.S. imperialism, the governments of over forty Western countries, including Britain, France, Italy, Canada, and Mexico, have unilaterally declared the "end of the state of war with Germany" starting July 9th. U.S. President Truman also wrote to Senate President Barkley and House Speaker Rayburn on the 9th, requesting the U.S. Congress to pass a resolution to "formally end the state of war between the United States and Germany that has existed since December 11, 1941."

　　This action by Western countries is the result of long-term planning by U.S. imperialism. As early as last September, the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France openly proposed to do so at a meeting in New York. The purpose is to allow West Germany to "break away" from its current enemy status towards these countries, making it an "equal" "ally" of Western countries and join the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, so that the United States can more freely arm West Germany, while insisting on splitting Germany and obstructing the conclusion of a treaty with Germany.

　　In his letters to Barkley and Rayburn, Truman clearly admitted the conspiracy of the United States to insist on splitting Germany, saying that the United States "is determined to do its best to promote" the aggressive policy of the United States "in the part of Germany it controls." At the same time, Truman particularly emphasized that although it is necessary to "end the state of war with Germany," the supreme power and occupation status enjoyed by the United States, Britain, and France in West Germany, as well as the so-called "occupation regulations" for West Germany, will continue indefinitely. He said: "The end of the state of war with Germany does not affect the occupation regulations. The rights of the occupying countries... will not be affected by the legal end of the state of war. ... We will not surrender these rights because the state of war is over."

　　TASS Washington, 11th, telegram exposes Truman's intention, saying: This point alone is enough to show that the decision of the United States, Britain, and France to "end the state of war with Germany" is only to deceive public opinion. In fact, it is very clear that the entire incident of "ending the state of war with Germany" is pursuing a definite goal: to prolong the division of Germany and create another excuse to delay the conclusion of a treaty with Germany as much as possible, ignoring the Soviet Union's proposal to immediately begin drafting and concluding a treaty with Germany. Undoubtedly, this step taken by the U.S. government and supported by the British and French governments has once again seriously undermined the Potsdam Agreement. The Potsdam Agreement stipulates that the state of war with Germany shall not be ended by unilateral declarations of these or those countries, but a treaty shall be concluded with the government of all Germany.

### 美帝国主义指使英、法、意等国政府  片面宣布“结束对德战争状态”  妄图分裂德国阻挠对德和约更加放手武装西德

　　美帝国主义指使英、法、意等国政府
    片面宣布“结束对德战争状态”
    妄图分裂德国阻挠对德和约更加放手武装西德
    【新华社十二日讯】在美帝国主义指使之下，英国、法国、意大利、加拿大、墨西哥等四十余个西方国家的政府，已于七月九日起，片面地宣告了“结束对德战争状态”。美国总统杜鲁门亦于九日分别写信给参议院议长巴克莱和众议院议长雷朋，要求美国国会通过决议，“正式结束自一九四一年十二月十一日以来所存在的美国对德战争状态”。
    西方国家的这一行动是美帝国主义长期策划的结果。早在去年九月，美、英、法三国外长在纽约举行会议时，就已公然提出要这样做了。其目的，就是要在坚持分裂德国和阻挠缔结对德和约的情况下，使西德“脱离”目前对这些国家所处的敌国地位，而使之得以作为西方国家“平等的”“盟友”加入北大西洋侵略集团，以便美国可以更加放手地武装西德。
    杜鲁门在写给巴克莱与雷朋的信中，明显地供认了美国坚持分裂德国的阴谋，他说：美国“决心在它所控制的德国那一部分尽力推行”美国的侵略政策。同时，杜鲁门又特别强调地宣布，虽然要“结束对德战争状态”，但是，美、英、法三国在西德所享有的无上权力和占领地位以及对西德的所谓“占领法规”，却还要无限期地延续下去。他说：“对德战争状态的结束不影响占领法规。占领国的权利………不会因为战争状态在法律上的结束而受到影响。………我们不会因为战争状态结束就交出这些权利。
    塔斯社华盛顿十一日电揭露杜鲁门这种说法的居心说：只是这一点，就足以说明：美、英、法三国决定“结束对德战争状态”，只是为了欺骗舆论。事实上，十分明显，关于“结束对德战争状态”的整个事件，是在追求一个确定的目标，就是：延长德国的分裂，并制造另一个借口来尽可能地拖延缔结对德和约，而置苏联主张立即开始草拟并缔结对德和约的建议于不顾。无疑的，美国政府所采取的而为英法政府所支持的这个步骤，又一次严重地破坏了波茨坦协定。波茨坦协定规定：不得以这些或那些国家的片面声明结束对德战争状态，而应与全德政府缔结和约。
