　　"Backward Village" Becomes Advanced Village
　　(Xinhua News Agency reporter Liu Xiuxue)
　　Xima Village was originally a "backward village" in Gaocheng County, Hebei Province. Since the village launched the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries this spring and executed some of the main counter-revolutionary criminals, various tasks have progressed smoothly, and the "backward village" has been transformed into an advanced village.
　　Why was Xima Village called a "backward village" in the past? The village cadres described its history this way: During the Anti-Japanese War, after the Japanese invaders occupied Gaocheng County, reactionary landlords such as Wang Laoyong colluded with the Japanese invaders and seized control of the village's political power, killing seven anti-Japanese district and village cadres, including Gan Zetao. After the Japanese invaders surrendered, Wang Laoyong and other reactionary landlords ran to Shijiazhuang and invited Chiang Kai-shek's troops to Xima Village. At that time, they drove out thirty-two revolutionary cadres and their families from the village, colluding with Chiang Kai-shek's army to demolish more than two hundred houses of the peasants. From August 10, 1946, they began a massacre, using bayonets to kill Wang Laosui, the director of the village peasants' association; they killed poor peasant Gan Laoxiong and peasant association cadres Gan Si and Gan Xiaozhu, and disemboweled these people and dug out their hearts. Li Laolian, a sixty-year-old peasant leader, was cut to death alive with knives, and the mother of Zhu Xiang, the secretary of the Communist Party branch in the village, was also killed with bayonets. The counter-revolutionary elements Wang Laoyong and other bandits killed thirty people in Xima Village in this way.
　　The peasants of Xima Village made a vow regarding this blood feud, saying: "If one day we catch Wang Laoyong and these executioners, we will cut off their heads to offer sacrifices to our dead relatives."
　　After the liberation of Gaocheng, the peasants of Xima Village indeed captured counter-revolutionary elements such as Wang Laoyong, Wang Baotian, and Gan Qingrui, and handed them over to the People's Government. However, not long after, the People's Government "leniency" towards them. After Wang Laoyong and others returned to the village, they continued to do evil and sabotage production. The people watched the executioners, whose hands were stained with the blood of their relatives, going unpunished, and were filled with anger, and production and work were discouraged. Since then, Xima Village, which had fought against the Japanese invaders, the Kuomintang bandits, and the local tyrants for many years, became a "backward village."
　　This spring, after the People's Government's movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries began, the attitude of the peasant masses in Xima Village was very indifferent. When personnel from the People's Government's public security organs went to the village to investigate the criminal materials of counter-revolutionary elements, many peasants dared not speak, or avoided talking about it. They were afraid that the government would "leniency" again, resulting in "not being able to kill a fly, just making oneself sick." Later, the people of the village saw that the People's Government had executed several extremely evil counter-revolutionary elements in the surrounding villages, and only then did they believe that the opportunity for revenge had arrived.
　　The village cadres immediately convened a mass meeting and decided to report the criminal facts of counter-revolutionary elements such as Wang Laoyong to the County People's Government, writing their bloody crimes one by one on the walls, and posting comic strips depicting the tragic situation of the people being slaughtered at that time on every street. Then, the people of the whole village held an accusation meeting. At the meeting, many people made accusations and shouted "Long live Chairman Mao" and demanded that the People's Government execute murderers like Wang Laoyong, Wang Baotian, and Gan Qingrui to avenge their relatives. Soon, these three deeply sinful counter-revolutionary elements were brought to justice in front of the people.
　　After the stone weighing on the hearts of the people of Xima Village was removed, the village was filled with a new atmosphere. During the "May Day" holiday, 70% of the villagers participated in the demonstration parade, and the elderly in their fifties and sixties also shaved their beards to participate in the parade and celebrate the victory of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. People happily said: "May Day" is not only Labor Day, but also the "Revenge Day" of the people of Xima Village. Everyone happily said: "The People's Government has eliminated the scourge for us, let's produce well!"
　　Because of this, the village planted less than 3,000 mu of cotton last year, and this year it overcame drought and completed the planting of more than 4,000 mu of cotton ahead of schedule. To ensure a bumper harvest and increased production of cotton, the peasants automatically insured 1,300 mu of cotton in the People's Insurance Company; in order to achieve "prosperity for both people and livestock," they also insured 300 head of livestock.
　　Various tasks in the village have also become active. The village originally had fourteen propagandists, but now it has grown to thirty-seven. The propagandists are actively carrying out patriotic education against American aggression and aiding Korea to the masses, and publicizing the regulations on punishing counter-revolutionaries. The militia has also been further organized to patrol and guard, protecting production. The village cadres and propagandists have also educated the families of counter-revolutionary elements, helping them distinguish between the enemy and ourselves and stand firm on the people's position.
　　In order to consolidate the victory of this suppression of counter-revolutionaries, Xima Village held a village people's representative meeting on June 3rd. After heated discussions by the sixty-eight representatives, a convention on preventing spies and eliminating special agents was established. All the representatives also challenged each other, guaranteeing that they would earnestly implement this convention among the masses they represented. The meeting also resolved to check the implementation of the anti-espionage convention once a month and establish a village public security committee to make the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries a regular practice.

### “落后村”变成了先进村

　　“落后村”变成了先进村
    （新华社记者刘修学）
    西马村原是河北省藁城县的一个“落后村”。自从今春该村展开了镇压反革命运动，处决了一些首恶的反革命分子以后，各种工作顺利开展，“落后村”才变成了先进村。
    西马村过去为什么被称为“落后村”呢？该村村干部这样叙述了它的来历：抗日战争时期中，自日寇占领了藁城县后，西马村的反动地主王老雍等投靠日寇，掌握着村里的政权，杀死了该村甘泽涛等七个抗日的区村干部。日寇投降后，王老雍等反动地主又跑到石家庄，把蒋匪部队请到西马村来。这时，他们把村里三十二个革命干部和他们的家属赶出去，勾结蒋匪军拆毁了农民的房子二百多间。从一九四六年八月十日起，他们又开始大屠杀，将村农会主任王老随用刺刀挑死；杀死了贫农甘老熊和农会干部甘四、甘小朱等，并把这些人开膛破肚，把心也挖了出来。六十岁的农民领袖李老连，被他们活活用刀割死，中共村支部书记朱祥的母亲也被挑死。反革命分子王老雍等匪徒，就这样前后杀死了西马村三十个人。
    西马村的农民对这血海深仇，曾立下过誓愿说：“倘有一天，捉住了王老雍这些刽子手后，一定割下他们的头来，祭奠我们死去的亲人。”
    藁城解放后，西马村的农民果然抓到了王老雍、王保田、甘庆瑞等反革命分子，并把他们交给了人民政府。但是不久，人民政府“宽大”了他们。王老雍等回村以后，却仍是继续作恶，破坏生产。人民眼望着两手沾满了亲人鲜血的刽子手们逍遥法外，气愤万分，生产、工作就都泄气了。从此，和日寇、国民党匪帮、恶霸地主搏斗多年的西马村，就变成了“落后村”。
    今春，人民政府镇压反革命运动开始后，西马村的农民群众态度很冷淡。人民政府公安机关人员到该村调查反革命分子的罪恶材料时，很多农民不敢说，或是避而不谈。他们害怕政府再来一次“宽大”，落个“打不死苍蝇，白闹个呕心”。后来，该村人们看到人民政府把周围村的几个罪大恶极的反革命分子处决后，才认为报仇的机会到来了。
    村干部立即召开了群众会议，决定把王老雍等反革命分子的罪恶事实报告县人民政府，把他们的血腥罪行一条条地写在墙上，把当时人民被屠杀的惨状画成连环画贴满各街。接着，全村人民又举行了控诉大会。会上，很多人进行控诉，并举手高呼“毛主席万岁”，要求人民政府枪决王老雍、王保田、甘庆瑞等凶手为亲人报仇。不久，这三个罪恶深重的反革命分子就在人民面前伏法了。
    压在西马村人民心上的石头搬掉之后，村中充满了一片新气象。“五一”节时，全村百分之七十的人参加了示威游行，五、六十岁的老人也刮了胡子去游行和庆祝镇压反革命的胜利。人们喜悦地说：“五一”不只是劳动节，还是西马村人民的“复仇节”。人人高兴地说：“人民政府给咱除了祸害，好好生产吧！”
    因为这样，全村去年种棉不足三千亩，今年便抗旱和提前完成种棉四千多亩。为保证棉花丰收增产，农民自动在人民保险公司保了一千三百亩棉花险；为达到“人畜两旺”，还保了三百头牲畜险。
    村中各项工作也活跃起来了。该村原有十四名宣传员，现已发展到三十七名。宣传员都积极地向群众进行抗美援朝爱国教育，宣传惩治反革命条例。民兵也更进一步地组织起来，放哨巡逻，保卫生产。村干部、宣传员并对反革命分子的家属进行了教育，帮助他们分清敌我，站稳人民立场。
    为巩固这次镇压反革命的胜利，西马村在六月三日举行了村人民代表会议。经六十八位代表的热烈讨论，订立了防奸细肃清特务公约。全体代表并互相挑战，保证在自己所代表的群众中认真执行这个公约。会议还决议每月检查一次执行防奸公约的情形和建立村治安委员会，把镇压反革命工作转向经常化。
