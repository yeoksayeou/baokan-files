　　Northeast Railway Locomotive No. 1008 Contract Group Sets New National Record for Daily Kilometers

　　The Youth Contract Group of Locomotive No. 1008, Type 1, of the Ang'angxi Locomotive Depot in Northeast China, traveled 1,113.4 kilometers in one day and night from June 26 to 27, setting a new national record for locomotive daily kilometers. The original standard for locomotive daily kilometers in Northeast China was 410 kilometers. Since the launch of the 500-kilometer daily locomotive movement last year, the daily kilometers have generally increased, and a large number of locomotives have reached or exceeded 500 kilometers, greatly improving the efficiency of locomotive use. During the 500-kilometer movement, Locomotive No. 1008 contract group traveled 1,003 kilometers on June 4, creating a new national record, and this time it set an even newer national record.
