　　The Indonesian Government Violates International Norms
　  Actually Refuses Entry to Our Consulate Personnel
　  Our Government Expresses Deep Regret and is Currently Negotiating on Just Grounds.
    【Xinhua News Agency, dated 25th】 He Ying, our Consul General stationed in Jakarta, Indonesia, along with nineteen staff members and their families from other consulates, arrived in Jakarta on the 22nd of July by ship. The Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs notified our embassy in Indonesia the day before the ship's arrival that only Consul General He and three others holding diplomatic passports would be permitted to disembark, refusing entry to the remaining sixteen individuals holding official passports. As a result, these sixteen individuals were forced to leave Jakarta with the ship and were unable to land. All personnel from our country traveling to Indonesia this time had obtained entry visas from the Indonesian Embassy in our country. However, the Indonesian government's refusal to allow the sixteen individuals holding official passports to disembark is a violation of international norms. Our government expresses deep regret over this matter and is currently continuing to negotiate with the Indonesian government on just grounds.

    【新华社二十五日讯】我驻印尼雅加达总领事何英及驻其他领馆的职员与家属等十九人，于七月二十二日乘轮抵达雅加达，印尼外交部竟于该轮到达前一日，通知我驻印尼大使馆，只准许持有外交护照之何总领事等三人上岸，拒绝其余持有官员护照之十六人入境，致此十六人被迫随轮离雅，未能登陆。我国此次所有去印尼人员均已取得驻我国印尼大使馆之入境签证，而印尼政府竟拒绝其中持官员护照的十六人登陆，这是违反国际惯例的行为，我政府对此表示非常遗憾，现正据理向印尼政府继续交涉中。
