To the Editor:

    I was very moved and grateful when I saw in the newspaper the news of the charity performances in Beijing and Shanghai by veteran Peking Opera artists Guo Diexian, Zhao Ruquan, Xiao Lanying, Shang Heyu, and Liu Xikui. They are already over sixty or seventy years old. Such a thing could only happen in the new China of the people. When our China Acrobatic Troupe went to the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union filmed a documentary about their activities. I hope the Film Bureau will also film the performances of these veteran artists. This will be a great encouragement to the Peking Opera community and will also promote the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea among the people of the whole country.

    京剧界老艺人的义演活动使我感动编辑同志：
    我在报上看见京剧界老艺人郭蝶仙、赵如泉、筱兰英、尚和玉、刘喜奎等在北京、上海义演的消息，使我非常的感动和感激。因为他们已经是六、七十岁以上的人了。像这样的事也只有在人民的新中国才会发生。我们中华杂技团到苏联去了一趟，苏联就把他们的活动拍了一部纪录片。我希望电影局把这些老艺人的演出情形也拍成电影，这对京剧界将是莫大的鼓励，对全国人民的抗美援朝运动也有推动作用。
