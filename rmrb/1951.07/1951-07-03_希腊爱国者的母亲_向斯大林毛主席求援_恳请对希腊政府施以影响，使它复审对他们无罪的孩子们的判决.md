　　Mothers of Greek Patriots
    Appeal to Stalin and Chairman Mao
    Requesting Influence on the Greek Government to Review the Sentences of Their Innocent Children
    [Xinhua News Agency, Athens, 2nd dispatch] According to TASS, Athens, 1st dispatch: The mothers of twelve Greek patriots sentenced to death by the Greek royalist-fascist government have sent a memorandum to Premier Stalin, Chairman Mao Zedong, Soviet representative to the United Nations Malik, and International Association of Democratic Lawyers President Pritt, requesting help to save their children.
    The memorandum points out that the Athens authorities have refused to retry the cases of the twelve patriots - Qiudas, Bosadias, Suodilakis, Modekesaduos, Haidakis, Falilesi, Aifeios, Yishalis, Kangstantinias, Luomias, Paipeiyanuoplas and Halampis - on the pretext that they were not sentenced before August 1, 1950, and therefore cannot appeal the verdicts of the special military court in accordance with the so-called leniency law. However, in fact, their case began to be heard as early as June 17, 1950, but the authorities deliberately delayed the verdict until August 10 of the same year.
    The memorandum emphasizes that the real reason why the Athens authorities refuse to retry this case is because these twelve patriots refuse to abandon their political views.
    The mothers of the twelve Greek patriots earnestly request influence be exerted on the Greek government, so that it orders a review of the sentences of their innocent children.

　　希腊爱国者的母亲
    向斯大林毛主席求援
    恳请对希腊政府施以影响，使它复审对他们无罪的孩子们的判决
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社雅典一日讯：被希腊保皇法西斯政府判处死刑的十二个希腊爱国者的母亲，以备忘录一件分致斯大林总理、毛泽东主席、苏联驻联合国代表马立克和国际民主法律工作者协会主席普里特，请求援救她们的孩子。
    备忘录指出：雅典当局已经拒绝重审十二个爱国者——邱达斯、波萨第亚斯、索底拉基斯、墨德克萨多斯、哈依达基斯、法利雷斯、埃费奥斯、依沙利斯、康斯坦丁尼亚斯、罗米亚斯、派培扬诺普拉斯和哈兰皮斯——的案件，借口他们不是在一九五○年八月一日以前宣判的，所以不能按照所谓宽大法的规定对特别军事法庭的判决提出上诉。但是，事实上他们的案件早在一九五○年六月十七日就开始审理了，后来当局故意拖延到同年八月十日才判决。
    备忘录着重指出：雅典当局拒绝重审这个案件的真正原因，是因为这十二个爱国者不肯放弃他们的政治见解。
    希腊十二个爱国者的母亲恳请对希腊政府施以影响，使它下令复审对她们无罪的孩子们的判决。
