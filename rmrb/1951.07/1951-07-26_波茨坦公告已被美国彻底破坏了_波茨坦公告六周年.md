　　The Potsdam Proclamation Has Been Thoroughly Sabotaged by the United States
　  ——Sixth Anniversary of the Potsdam Proclamation
　　Lin Tianmo
    On July 26, 1945, China, the United States, and the United Kingdom signed a solemn proclamation in Potsdam, southwest of Berlin, Germany, urging Japan to immediately cease resistance and end the war. This is the famous Potsdam Proclamation. Later, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan and also joined in signing this proclamation. The Potsdam Proclamation then became the main document for China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom to end the war against Japan and peacefully resolve the Japanese issue.
    After the Soviet Union declared war on Japan, it immediately crushed the Japanese elite force, the Kwantung Army. Seeing that the overall situation was irreversible, Japanese imperialism had no choice but to accept the terms of the Potsdam Proclamation and declare its surrender.
    With Japan's surrender, the stage of peacefully resolving the Japanese issue began. How to peacefully resolve the Japanese issue? The terms of Japan's surrender listed in the Potsdam Proclamation are the yardstick for peacefully resolving the Japanese issue. The Potsdam Proclamation was unconditionally accepted by Japan upon surrender and was jointly signed by China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Therefore, this proclamation not only places obligations on Japan that must be fulfilled, but also places responsibilities on China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom that must be observed. This solemn proclamation, this sacred international agreement, has been recognized as the most basic common program for peacefully resolving the Japanese issue after the war. Without the Potsdam Proclamation, peace in the Far East would be undermined, and a new Japan of independence, democracy, and freedom could not be established. This is because the Potsdam Proclamation provides clear guidelines on how to eliminate Japanese aggression, how to safeguard the rights and interests of the Allied powers, and how to ensure the independence and autonomy of the Japanese nation, as well as the democratic freedom and stable life of the Japanese people.
    Today is the sixth anniversary of the Potsdam Proclamation, and it has been almost six years since Japan's surrender. If, during these six years, the Allied countries and Japan could have consistently adhered to the Potsdam Proclamation, faithfully fulfilled the obligations and responsibilities of the Potsdam Proclamation, and handled the Japanese issue in accordance with the principles stipulated in the various clauses of the Potsdam Proclamation, it is believed that Japan would have embarked on the path of genuine peace and democracy, and peace in the Far East would have been fundamentally guaranteed. However, the United States has gone in the opposite direction. For six years, the United States has dominated Japan, and its actions have completely violated the principles of the Potsdam Proclamation. Moreover, the United States itself has replaced Japanese imperialism, violated the Potsdam Proclamation and other international agreements, and is pursuing a new policy of aggression and war in the Far East along the old path of Japanese imperialism.
    The Potsdam Proclamation pointed out that peace, security, and a just new order in Japan and Asia could not be established unless Japanese militarism was eliminated. Therefore, it determined that the authority and influence of those who deceived and misled the Japanese people into desiring to conquer the world must be permanently eradicated; the Japanese invading forces must be completely disarmed; Japanese war criminals, including those who mistreated Allied prisoners of war, would be subject to legal judgment; and industries that could enable Japan to rearm for war would not be maintained. These are necessary measures to eliminate the militaristic aggression of Japanese militarism, but the United States has not followed them. On the contrary, it has always shielded the authority and influence of those whom the Potsdam Proclamation condemned for deceiving and misleading the Japanese people into desiring to conquer the world, released war criminals with hands stained with the blood of the people of Asia and Australia, lifted the purge of a large number of militarists, and encouraged them to return to their old ways and use them for its own purposes. It has also restored and expanded land, sea, and air force bases everywhere in Japan, rebuilt Japanese armed forces under various names, and revived and expanded Japanese war industries in many ways, turning Japan into a base for new aggressive wars. The United States has already used Japan in this way in its war of aggression against Korea. Recently, the United States has accelerated preparations to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan, further intensifying its efforts to destroy the Potsdam Proclamation at its roots, and to "legalize" and "treatify" the acts of illegally rearming Japan and reviving Japanese militarism. The draft peace treaty with Japan, unilaterally drawn up by the United States in conjunction with the United Kingdom, even claims that Japan has the "natural right to individual or collective self-defense" and places no restrictions on Japanese armament; and under the guise of "Japan's automatic participation in collective security measures," it is preparing to use Japanese armed forces as cannon fodder for aggression. Clearly, the United States intends to arm Japan without limit and fully revive Japanese militarism.
    The Potsdam Proclamation stipulated that Japanese territory should be occupied by the Allied powers for a certain period of time, the main purpose of which was to supervise the complete disarmament of the Japanese invading forces and the destruction of Japan's war-making capabilities. It also stipulated that as soon as the objectives of the occupation were achieved, and a peace-loving and responsible government was established in accordance with the freely expressed will of the Japanese people, the occupying forces should be withdrawn immediately. However, the U.S. occupying forces in Japan have completely abandoned the trust of the Allied powers. As mentioned above, not only have they not completely disarmed the Japanese invading forces, but they have re-armed them; they have not only not destroyed Japan's war-making capabilities, but have nurtured them. Under these circumstances, a peace-loving government that can express the free will of the Japanese people naturally cannot be established. The reactionary Japanese government, with the support of the United States, has consistently failed to fulfill the obligations that the Potsdam Proclamation requires it to fulfill. The United States now also attempts to station troops in Japan for a long time. Although the U.S.-made draft peace treaty with Japan ostensibly states that the occupying forces will withdraw from Japan within ninety days after the treaty comes into effect, it also stipulates that foreign troops may "station or remain in Japanese territory" under "bilateral or multilateral agreements." The foreign troops referred to are actually U.S. troops; the so-called "bilateral or multilateral agreements" are "U.S.-Japan military agreements" and the like. In this way, U.S. troops will be stationed in Japan indefinitely based on "agreements." The United States not only regards Japan as a base of aggression, but also wants to make Japan a colony under direct U.S. military control. The Potsdam Proclamation solemnly declares that the Allied powers have no intention of enslaving the Japanese nation or destroying its country, but the intention of the United States is precisely to enslave the Japanese nation and destroy the Japanese state. The peace treaty with Japan, concluded on the basis of the U.S.-made draft treaty, is also a treaty for the subjugation and extermination of Japan.
    The Potsdam Proclamation stipulated that all obstacles preventing the revival and strengthening of democratic tendencies among the Japanese people must be removed, and that the Japanese people's freedom of speech, religion, and thought, as well as basic human rights, must be respected; it also permitted Japan to maintain the economic production and international trade necessary for its peaceful life. However, under the rule of the United States, which regards Japan as a colony and a military base, the political and economic life of the Japanese people has deteriorated in the past six years. The United States has used fascist means to suppress the democratic forces in Japan by any means possible. The blood-sucking plunder and military burden of U.S. monopoly capital have made the Japanese people live an extremely miserable life. The United States does not allow the Japanese people to have a democratic, free, and stable life, which is also clearly manifested in the U.S.-made draft peace treaty with Japan. This draft does not provide any guarantee for the democratic and free rights of the Japanese people. And the so-called "most-favored-nation treatment" and "national treatment" are merely for the convenience of U.S. monopoly capital to control the Japanese economy to a greater and more extensive degree. The Japanese economy, which is in the position of an arsenal, and the blood-sucking policy of U.S. monopoly capital have created a hellish life for the Japanese people.
    The Potsdam Proclamation stipulated that the Cairo Declaration of China, the United States, and the United Kingdom must be implemented, and the Cairo Declaration clearly stated that the purpose of the three countries in waging war against Japan was to stop and punish Japan's aggression, with no intention of seeking gains for themselves or expanding their territory; it also stipulated that Taiwan and Penghu should be returned to China, and Korea should be free and independent. However, the United States does not fulfill the sacred promise of the Cairo Declaration. It embraces Japan, occupies islands near Japan, invades Korea, and occupies Taiwan. Although the U.S.-made draft peace treaty with Japan stipulates that Japan relinquish all rights to Taiwan and Penghu, it does not stipulate that they should be returned to China in accordance with the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation. While arming and invading Taiwan, it also intends to make the attribution of Taiwan and Penghu ambiguous in the peace treaty with Japan, so as to seize them as its own. The U.S.-made draft peace treaty also intends to usurp all of the Pacific islands formerly under Japanese mandate, as well as many islands near Japan south of 29 degrees north latitude—the Ryukyu Islands, the Ogasawara Islands, the Iwo Jima Islands, Nishinoshima, Okinotori Island, Minami-Tori-shima, etc.—as its own territory and permanently occupy them in the name of "United Nations trusteeship" and "the United States as its sole administering authority." The selfish and self-interested imperialist aims and the ambition to expand territory of the United States are clearly revealed.
    It can be said that none of the actions of the United States in Japan in the past six years has been in line with the Potsdam Proclamation. The solemn clauses of the Potsdam Proclamation have been thoroughly sabotaged by the United States.
    The absurd and outrageous actions of the United States do not stop there. As the whole world knows, China is the country that fought against Japanese imperialism for the longest time, with the greatest effort, and with the greatest sacrifices. The Potsdam Proclamation was also jointly signed by China and the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. However, in its unilaterally convened San Francisco conference and the draft peace treaty with Japan jointly drafted with the United Kingdom, the United States excluded China from the list of Allied powers. Even in Chapter 5 of the draft, which deals with the handling of the property and rights and interests of the Allied powers and their nationals in Japan during the war, the starting and ending dates are only stipulated as December 7, 1941, to September 2, 1945, completely erasing the period of China's independent resistance against Japan before December 7, 1941. This is a deliberate attempt by the United States to obliterate the great achievements of the Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japan. The Chinese people will never tolerate such an unconscionable and hostile act by the United States.
    The United States' abandonment of the Potsdam Proclamation, its insistence on a policy of aggression and war, and its reckless actions have caused great harm to the people of Asia and Australia, as well as the Japanese people. The peace-loving people of Asia and Australia and the people of the world, as well as the Japanese people who do not want to be slaves or cannon fodder, are fighting against the United States' destruction of the Potsdam Proclamation and other international agreements, against the United States' arming of Japan, and against the United States' conclusion of a separate peace treaty with Japan. Although U.S. imperialism is extremely vicious, we believe that the power of the people of Asia and Australia, the people of the world, and the Japanese people united is not to be underestimated, and U.S. imperialism will surely fail in the face of the powerful force of the people.
    Today is the sixth anniversary of the Potsdam Proclamation. We must strengthen our struggle against U.S. imperialism in order to safeguard the Potsdam Proclamation.

　　波茨坦公告已被美国彻底破坏了
　  ——波茨坦公告六周年
　　林天摩
    一九四五年七月二十六日，中、美、英三国在德国柏林西南波茨坦地方，签署了一个庄严的文告，促令日本立即停止抵抗，结束战争。这就是著名的波茨坦公告。其后苏联对日宣战，也即加入签署这个文告，波茨坦公告遂成为中、苏、美、英四大国结束对日战争及和平解决日本问题的主要文件。
    苏联对日宣战后，立即击溃了日本精锐部队关东军。日本帝国主义见大势已去，乃不得不接受波茨坦公告的条款，宣告投降。
    随着日本的投降，即进入了和平解决日本问题的阶段。怎样和平解决日本问题呢？波茨坦公告所列日本投降条款，也就是和平解决日本问题的准绳。波茨坦公告是日本投降时无条件接受的，也是中、苏、美、英四国所共同签署的。因此，这个公告不但日本有必须履行的义务，中、苏、美、英也有必须遵守的职责。这个庄严的文告，这个神圣的国际协议，已被公认为战后和平解决日本问题的最基本的共同纲领。离开了波茨坦公告，远东和平就会被破坏，独立、民主、自由的新日本也就不可能建立。因为，波茨坦公告对于怎样肃清日本侵略势力，怎样维护盟国的权益，怎样保障日本国家民族的独立自主和日本人民的民主自由及安定的生活，都有了明确的提示。
    今天是波茨坦公告六周年纪念日，日本投降也已经快近六年了。六年间如果各盟国和日本都能一致信守波茨坦公告，忠实履行波茨坦公告的义务和职责，依照波茨坦公告各条款所规定的方针处理日本问题，相信日本必已走上真正和平民主的大道，而远东和平也必能得到基本的保障。可是，美国却反其道而行。六年来美国独霸日本，所作所为，完全违反了波茨坦公告的原则。不仅如此，美国自己已代替了日本帝国主义，破坏波茨坦公告及其他国际协议，沿着过去日本帝国主义的老路，在远东进行新的侵略政策和战争政策。
    波茨坦公告指出：非将日本军国主义消灭，则日本和亚洲的和平安全及正义的新秩序势不可能建立，因此它确定：欺骗及错误领导日本人民使其妄欲征服世界者之威权及势力，必须永久铲除；日本侵略军队须完全解除武装；包括虐待盟国俘虏在内的日本战争罪犯将处以法律的裁判；可以使日本重新武装作战的工业，将不予维持。这些，是肃清日本军国主义黩武侵略势力的必要措施，然而美国并没有依照这样做。相反，它始终庇护着波茨坦公告所指斥的欺骗及错误领导日本人民使其妄欲征服世界者之威权及势力，释放满手沾染亚澳人民鲜血的战争罪犯，解除大批军国主义分子的整肃，鼓励他们重操旧业，以为己用。它又在日本到处恢复并扩建陆海空军基地，用各种名义重建日本武装部队，多方面复兴并扩充日本战争工业，把日本当作进行新的侵略战争的基地。美国在侵略朝鲜的战争中，已经这样利用了日本。最近美国加速准备缔结单独对日和约，更变本加厉地要把波茨坦公告连根毁掉，使非法重新武装日本与复活日本军国主义的行为，“合法化”、“条约化”。美国会同英国所片面拟成的对日和约草案，竟以日本得拥有“单独或集体自卫之自然权利”为名，对日本武装不加任何限制；并在“日本得自动加入集体安全之措施”的幌子下，准备利用日本武装部队作为侵略炮灰。显然，美国是要无限制武装日本，全面复活日本军国主义。
    波茨坦公告规定日本领土在一定时期内须经盟国占领，其主要目的是监督日本完全解除侵略军队的武装，毁灭日本制造战争的力量。又规定：一俟占领目的达到，及依据日本人民自由表示之意志成立一倾向和平及负责之政府后，占领军当即撤退。然而，美国在日本的占领军却完全背弃了盟国的重托，如前述，它不但没有完全解除日本侵略军队的武装，而且重新给与日本侵略军队以武装；它不但不曾毁灭日本制造战争的力量，而且培养日本制造战争的力量。在这种情况之下，可表示日本人民的自由意志而倾向和平的政府，自然无由建立。日本反动政府受着美国的支持，一直没有履行波茨坦公告必须履行的义务。美国现在还企图长期驻军日本。美制对日和约草案虽然表面上说占领军将于和约生效后九十日内撤离日本，但另外却又规定外国军队可以“双边或多边协定”，“在日本境内驻扎或留守”。所指外国军队实际上就是美国军队；所谓“双边或多边协定”，就是“美日军事协定”之类。这样，美国军队便根据“协定”而无限期在日本驻下去了。美国不但把日本当作侵略基地，而且要使日本成为美国直接军事控制下的殖民地。波茨坦公告郑重昭示：盟国无意奴役日本民族或消灭其国家，而美国的意图却正是要奴役日本民族，灭亡日本国家。根据美制和约草案进行签订的对日和约，也便是日本亡国灭族的条约。
    波茨坦公告规定必须将阻止日本人民民主趋势之复兴及增强之所有障碍予以消除，必须尊重日本人民之言论、宗教、与思想自由以及基本人权；又准许日本得维持其和平生活所必需的经济生产与国际贸易。可是在美国把日本当作殖民地和军事基地的统治下，六年来日本人民的政治生活和经济生活，每况愈下。美国运用法西斯手段，镇压日本民主力量，无所不用其极。美国独占资本吸血敲髓的搜刮及军事的重负，使日本人民过着极端悲惨的生活。美国不让日本人民有民主自由及安定的生活，在美制对日和约草案中也明显地表现了出来。这个草案对于日本人民的民主自由权利，没有丝毫予以保障的规定。而所谓“最惠国待遇”与“国民待遇”，不过是为着便利美国独占资本更高度更广泛地控制日本经济而已。处于兵工厂地位的日本经济及美国独占资本的吸血政策，造成了日本人民的地狱生活。
    波茨坦公告规定中、美、英三国开罗宣言必将实施，而开罗宣言则明示：三国对日本进行战争之目的，在于制止及惩罚日本之侵略，决不为自身图利，亦无拓展领土之意；又规定台湾、澎湖应归还中国，朝鲜应自由独立。可是，美国并不履行开罗宣言的神圣约言，它囊括日本，占据日本附近岛屿，侵略朝鲜，霸占台湾。美制对日和约草案虽然规定日本放弃其对于台湾和澎湖的一切权益，但并不规定遵照开罗宣言和波茨坦公告归还中国。它一面武装侵霸台湾，一面又打算在对日和约中把台湾澎湖的归属含混其词，以攫为己有。美制对日和约草案同时又打算把前由日本委任统治的太平洋岛屿，以至北纬二十九度以南的日本附近的许多岛屿——琉球群岛、小笠原群岛、硫磺群岛、西之岛、冲之鸟岛、南鸟岛等，以“联合国托管”、“美国为其唯一管理当局”的名义，一律篡窃为它自己的领土而永久占有。美国自私自利的帝国主义目的及拓展领土的野心，昭然若揭。
    可以说，六年来美国在日本的行为，没有一件是符合波茨坦公告的。波茨坦公告的庄严条款已被美国彻底破坏了。
    美国的荒谬绝伦的行动还不止此。举世皆知，中国是对日本帝国主义作战最久最力、牺牲最大最多的国家，波茨坦公告也是中国和美国、英国及苏联所共同签署的。但美国在它片面召开旧金山会议及与英国合拟而成的对日和约草案中，竟把中国排除于盟国名单之外。甚至草案第五章关于处理盟国及其国民于战争时期在日本的财产和权益的条文中，其起迄日期仅规定为一九四一年十二月七日至一九四五年九月二日，而把一九四一年十二月七日以前中国人民单独对日抗战那一个时期，完全抹去了。这是美国有意要把中国人民抗日战争的伟绩，横加抹煞。中国人民决不能容忍美国这样丧尽天良的敌对行为。
    美国背弃波茨坦公告，坚持侵略政策和战争政策，胡作非为，对亚澳各国人民以及日本人民，都有莫大祸害。爱好和平的亚澳各国人民与世界人民，不愿做亡国奴当炮灰的日本人民，正在为着反对美国破坏波茨坦公告等国际协议，反对美国武装日本，反对美国缔结单独对日和约而斗争。美帝国主义虽然穷凶极恶，但我们相信，亚澳各国人民与世界人民以及日本人民联合起来的力量，是不可轻侮的，美帝国主义一定要在强大的人民力量面前失败。
    今天是波茨坦公告六周年，我们要为维护波茨坦公告而加强与美帝国主义作斗争。
