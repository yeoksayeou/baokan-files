In Wangshang Township, Seventh District, Dengfeng, Henan, during this cotton purchase and storage campaign, because the district and township cadres lacked sufficient understanding and mastery of the policies, and failed to properly publicize them to the masses beforehand, many unreasonable phenomena occurred. This completely violated the spirit of "advising farmers with cotton to sell their stored cotton to the state immediately at reasonable listed prices." Instead of patiently mobilizing them politically and ideologically, and persuading them to voluntarily sell their stored cotton to the state, they used the simple method of "assigning tasks" and even rudely searched farmers' homes.

Wangshang Township is a semi-mountainous, semi-plain area. Last year, there were about 760 mu of cotton fields. This time, the district assigned a task of purchasing and storing 7,000 jin of cotton. After the task was distributed to the township, it was further distributed to each village, and each natural village mobilized households to report their cotton. The natural village cadres held many mass meetings to mobilize the sale and storage of cotton while the farmers were busy with rush planting. The meetings failed to clearly explain the reasons for selling cotton to the state out of patriotism in connection with the specific lives of the farmers. As a result, the masses only reported very little cotton. Some farmers said, "We are so busy, whether we take the cotton out or not, we will be searched anyway, so we might as well hand it over and avoid meetings that delay production." The cadres also got angry and started searching. The women in Liu Baode's family did not often attend meetings and were not ideologically convinced, so none of them reported their cotton. During the search, some hid, some concealed, and some took it out through the back door.

In some villages, the village cadres discussed and directly assigned the tasks to each household. One village had a total of 84 households with a task of 1,050 jin. Almost none of the tasks assigned to each household were completed.

Some villages used the method of "self-reporting and public discussion." Wangshang, Mawan, and Hangou villages all did this. As a result, everyone told each other how much to contribute. There were 254 households like this. Some were dissatisfied and said, "At that time, you couldn't refuse to report, it was like struggling against a local tyrant." When assigning the task of delivering cotton to Wang Yongsheng's family, they looked back five years and calculated that his family should have 90 jin of cotton. Once calculated, they demanded these 90 jin of cotton from him.

The above-mentioned erroneous practices have now been corrected by the local leading organs.

### 河南登封七区王上乡  购棉采用强迫手段  结果没有完成任务

　　河南登封七区王上乡
    购棉采用强迫手段
    结果没有完成任务
    登封七区王上乡，在这次购棉储棉工作中，因为区、乡干部对政策的了解和掌握不够，事前又没有很好地向群众宣传，所以出了不少不合理的现象，完全违犯了“劝告有棉花的农民在合理牌价下将存棉立即卖给国家”的精神，不是耐心地从政治上思想上进行动员，劝他们把自己的存棉自愿地卖给国家，而是用“分配任务”的简单方法来作，甚至粗暴地在农民家里进行搜查。
    王上乡是个半山半川的地区，去年棉田有七百六十亩左右，这一次区里分配的购棉储棉任务是七千斤。任务分到乡里以后，再由乡往各闾分配，由各自然村自行动员各户报棉花。各自然村干部在农民忙于抢种的时候开了不少的群众会来动员售棉储棉。会上没有把爱国售棉的道理和农民的具体生活结合起来谈清楚，结果群众只报了很少一点棉花。有的农民说：“这样忙，有花就拿出来，不拿出来就搜，省得开会，耽误生产。”干部们也起火了，就开始搜。刘保德家的各个妇女，因为不常参加开会，她们思想不通，各个人的花都没有报。搜的时候，躲的躲、藏的藏，有的从后门往外拿。
    有些村是由村干部讨论后就把任务分到各户。有一个村共八十四户，任务是一千零五十斤。差不多分到各户的任务，都没有完成。
    有些村是用的“自报公议”办法，王上、马湾、韩沟村都是这样办的。结果大家叫谁出多少，谁就得出多少。像这样的户，有二百五十四家。有的就不满意地说：“那时候不报也不中，像斗恶霸一样。”分配王永盛家交棉任务时，把他家的情况，向前推算五年，算了九十斤棉花；一算好，就要向他要这九十斤棉花。
    以上错误作法，现已由当地领导机关进行了纠正。
