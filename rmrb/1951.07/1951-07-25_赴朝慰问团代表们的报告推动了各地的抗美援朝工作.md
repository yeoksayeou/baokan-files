Reports from Delegation to Korea Boost Anti-American, Aid-Korea Efforts Across the Country

Representatives from the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea are currently traveling in groups throughout cities and counties nationwide to deliver reports to the general public. According to local newspapers, in twenty-four cities alone, including Tianjin, Baoding, Tangshan, Xinxiang, Taiyuan, Zhangjiakou, Xuanhua, Datong, Ulanhot, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Chongqing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Nanning, Kaifeng, Nanchang, Shanghai, Nanjing, Jinan, Qingdao, Wuhu, Wuxi, and Hangzhou, over 4.7 million people have directly heard the representatives' reports, with millions more listening to their radio broadcasts. The representatives shared the true situation they witnessed firsthand on the Korean frontlines with the general public. The delegation's film, performing arts, and folk art troupes conveyed the heroic deeds of the Chinese People's Volunteers to the people of the motherland through artistic expression, enabling the entire nation to more deeply appreciate the great victories of the Chinese and Korean people in their struggle against American aggression, to more clearly understand the brutality of American imperialism, and to learn about the arduous combat conditions faced by the Chinese People's Volunteers. These reports have brought the Korean frontlines and the people of the motherland closer together. After hearing the reports, the general public's enthusiasm for resisting America and aiding Korea has surged even higher, leading to more active efforts in donating planes and cannons, providing preferential treatment to families of martyrs and soldiers, and promoting patriotic pacts. Workers and farmers are intensifying their patriotic production increase campaigns, and young people are launching a wave of joining military cadre schools.

While the representatives of the First Sub-Delegation were working in Xi'an, they received 1,135 letters of慰问 from local people addressed to the representatives and to the Chinese and Korean People's forces. In these letters, people from all walks of life offered assurances of strengthening the work of resisting America and aiding Korea. After hearing the report, workers at a factory in Chongqing completed the repair work of a horsepower machine, originally scheduled to take twelve days, in just nine days. The workers said, "The Volunteers are not afraid of difficulties and fight bravely, so we must work even harder." Employees of the Tangshan Qixin Yanghui Factory presented the Volunteers with gifts of overproducing 1,000 tons of cement and 800 to 900 tons of gray blocks in June. Farmers in Huiji Township and Dacheng Township in the suburbs of Wuhan, while listening to the representatives' reports, immediately elected representatives to the stage to express: "The farmers in our whole township guarantee to promote the patriotic pact and include this clause in the patriotic pact: strive to increase production by 15 jin of grain per dou of land to support the Volunteers." After listening to the reports, farmers in Puyang and Changyuan counties in Pingyuan Province, while paying the summer public grain, put forward the patriotic slogan of "Good citizens, deliver good grain, have the strength to resist America, aid Korea, and defend our homes and country," and launched patriotic competition campaigns of "One cannon blast, villages complete delivery" and "One cannon blast, half-day complete delivery." After hearing the reports, 223 students from the Party School of the CPC Xin County Local Committee in Shanxi Province and the cadre training class of the Xin County Special District requested to go to Korea to kill the enemy. Inspired by the representatives' reports, students from the No. 1 Middle School in Anyang City, Pingyuan Province, had two classes entirely request to register for military cadre schools on the same day. Female student Gu Xiurong asked to go to the front lines in Korea. She said: After hearing the representatives say that a nurse at the front has to take care of more than thirty wounded soldiers: "If I go, can't I take care of fifteen for her?" After hearing the reports, the industrial and commercial circles in Guangzhou accelerated the campaign to donate planes and cannons, increasing their pledged donations from ten to thirty-one planes. The ceramic industry in the industrial and commercial circles of Tangshan City originally donated 35.78 million yuan, which increased to 55.96 million yuan after hearing the report.

People in various places expressed extreme welcome to the representatives. When the representatives of the First Sub-Delegation arrived in Lanzhou on June 29, there were 120,000 people lining the streets to welcome them, accounting for about half of the city's population. More than 30% of the people in Taiyuan City have heard the representatives' reports. The leading organs in many areas have also assisted the work of the delegation's representatives well. Shandong, Zhejiang, Shanxi and other provinces have sent some personnel to assist the representatives to go to various counties to make reports. Before the arrival of the representatives of the delegation to Korea, some areas convened symposiums of representatives from all walks of life by the local branch of the Resist America and Aid Korea Association, and prepared all the preparatory work, so that the representatives could smoothly start their work after arriving. Many cities organized broadcast report meetings and organized the people who had listened to the representatives' reports, asking them to go back to deliver the reports or hold discussions, which expanded the influence of the representatives' reports. The Pingyuan Provincial Urban Work Group of the Fifth Sub-Delegation, the Northwest General Sub-Association of Resisting America and Aiding Korea, the Taiyuan City and Tangshan City Associations of Resisting America and Aiding Korea and other units, summarized the work experience of the representatives' reports in a timely manner to improve their work. According to the experience of the representatives' reports in Xi'an, Xinxiang, Anyang, Tangshan, Taiyuan and other cities, it is generally most appropriate to go deep into various units and various strata to hold report meetings of about 1,000 to 2,000 to 3,000 people. Such report meetings are easier to convene because the degree of the audience is relatively similar, and the effect is also better, especially in small cities with poor material conditions. Under the current hot weather conditions, general report meetings should not be too large. Before and after the report, the ideological situation and mass reactions of the local masses should be provided to the representatives making the report in a timely manner so that the representatives' reports can have a greater effect.

　　赴朝慰问团代表们的报告推动了各地的抗美援朝工作
    中国人民赴朝慰问团的代表们，现正分组深入全国各市、县向广大人民作传达报告。据各地报纸所载，仅天津、保定、唐山、新乡、太原、张家口、宣化、大同、乌兰浩特、西安、兰州、重庆、武汉、广州、南宁、开封、南昌、上海、南京、济南、青岛、芜湖、无锡、杭州等二十四个城市，即已有四百七十万余人直接听过代表们的传达报告，另有成百万的群众收听了代表们的广播报告。代表们把在朝鲜前线耳闻目见的真实情况，告诉了广大人民；代表团的电影队、文工队、曲艺队等，则将志愿军的英勇事迹，通过艺术的形式来传达给祖国人民，使全国人民更深切地体会到了中、朝人民在抗击美国侵略斗争中的伟大胜利，更清楚地明了了美帝国主义的残暴，也知道了中国人民志愿军艰苦作战的情况。这些报告，把朝鲜前线与祖国人民更紧密地联系在一起了。广大人民在听了报告之后，抗美援朝的情绪更加高涨，更积极地推进捐献飞机大炮、优待烈属军属、推行爱国公约等工作，工人、农民加紧开展爱国增产运动，青年们掀起了参加军事干部学校的热潮。
    慰问团第一分团代表在西安工作时，收到了当地人民给代表们的慰问信和请代表们转给中、朝人民部队的慰问信一千一百三十五封。在这些信里，各界人民纷纷提出加强抗美援朝工作的保证。重庆某工厂的工人，在听了报告之后，以九天的时间完成了原计划十二天作完的马力机修复工作。工人们说：“志愿军不怕困难，英勇作战，我们也要加倍工作才行。”唐山启新洋灰厂的职工，以六月份超额生产洋灰一千吨、灰块八百至九百吨等项成绩作为对志愿军的献礼。武汉市郊区惠济乡、大成乡的农民，在听取代表们的报告时，当场推选代表上台表示：“我们全乡农民保证推行爱国公约，并在爱国公约里订上这一条：争取每斗田增产十五斤粮食来支援志愿军。”平原省濮阳、长垣两县农民听了报告之后，在缴纳夏季公粮中，提出了“好公民，交好粮，抗美援朝保家卫国有力量”的爱国口号，并开展了“一声炮响、村村交齐”和“一声炮响，半天交齐”的爱国竞赛运动。山西省中共忻县地方委员会党校和忻县专区干部训练班的学员，在听了报告之后，有二百二十三人请求赴朝杀敌。平原省安阳市第一中学学生为代表们的报告所鼓舞，当天便有两个班的学生全体要求报名投考军事干部学校。女生顾秀容要求到朝鲜前线去。她说：听代表们说前方一个护士要照顾三十多个伤员：“我去了不是可以替她照顾十五个吗？”广州市的工商界，在听了报告之后，加紧进行捐献飞机大炮运动，他们认捐的飞机已由十架增至三十一架。唐山市工商界的陶瓷业，原捐三千五百七十八万元，听了报告之后增至五千五百九十六万元。
    各地人民对代表们表示了极度的欢迎。第一分团的代表于六月二十九日抵兰州时，夹道欢迎的群众有十二万人，约占全市人口的半数。太原市人民有百分之三十以上听过代表们的报告。许多地区的领导机关，都很好地协助了慰问团代表的工作。山东、浙江、山西等省，都派了一部分人员协助代表们分赴各县作报告。有的地区并在赴朝慰问团代表到达之前，由当地抗美援朝分会召开了各界代表座谈会，作好了各项准备工作，使代表们到达之后即能顺利地展开工作。许多城市都组织了广播报告大会，并把听过代表们报告的人组织起来，请他们回去作传达或举行讨论，这些都扩大了代表们作报告的影响。慰问团第五分团平原省城市工作组，西北抗美援朝总分会、太原市和唐山市抗美援朝分会等单位，都及时总结了代表们作报告的工作经验，以改进工作。据代表们在西安、新乡、安阳、唐山、太原等市作报告的经验，一般以分别深入各单位、各阶层，召开千人左右至二、三千人的报告会为最适宜。这样的报告会因听众的程度比较相近，召集也较容易，收的效果也较好，特别是在物质条件较差的小城市，在目前天气炎热的情况下，一般的报告会不宜太大。报告前后，要将当地群众的思想情况和群众反应等及时供给作报告的代表，使代表们的报告能发生更大的效果。（附图片）
