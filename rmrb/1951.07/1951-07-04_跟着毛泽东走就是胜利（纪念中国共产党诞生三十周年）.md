　　Following Mao Zedong Means Victory
   (In Commemoration of the Thirtieth Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China)
    Xi Zhongxun
    We warmly celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, and warmly celebrate the victory of Mao Zedong Thought.
    The reason why we Chinese Communists have been able to achieve such a great victory after thirty years of arduous and extraordinary revolutionary struggle is because we have the wise leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and Mao Zedong Thought, which is the combination of Marxist-Leninist theory and the practice of the Chinese revolution. Mao Zedong Thought is nothing but a new development of Marxism-Leninism in the Chinese revolution. It has created a model for the world's colonial and semi-colonial revolutionary movements. Since this theory came into being, the wheel of the Chinese people's revolution has been advancing along the road to victory. This theory has educated the Chinese Communists and the Chinese people. Following Mao Zedong means victory.
    On the occasion of commemorating the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, I would like to give a brief account of the history and current situation of the Party's struggle in the Northwest region.
    The revolutionary struggle led by the Communist Party of China began in the Northwest between 1922 and 1923. Initially, a small number of Communist Party members and communists spread Marxist ideas in schools in Guanzhong, northern Shaanxi, and other places, and established and developed Communist Party organizations. With this condition, the Northwest revolutionary movement, centered on Xi'an, developed greatly during the Great Revolution of 1926-27. At that time, we formed a united front with the progressive forces of the Kuomintang, and did a lot of work in the military, political power, culture, education, and mass movements. The number of party members developed to several thousand. However, the leaders at that time did not understand the reactionary nature of the Kuomintang rightists, and did not prepare for sudden incidents, committing right-leaning opportunism. In the summer of 1927, after the Kuomintang's Zhengzhou meeting, the Kuomintang became counter-revolutionary, killing and driving away communists. The Communist Party and the revolutionary people suffered extremely serious losses.
    The Communists were not discouraged, but regrouped and fought the enemy. Moreover, led by Comrades Liu Zhidan and Gao Gang, they found a correct line in the eight years from the failure of the Great Revolution in 1927 to 1935, in the struggle against the enemy and in the struggle against opportunism within the Party. This struggle was carried out under the call and influence of Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Zhu De to develop revolutionary armed forces and establish revolutionary base areas in the South.
    What method should be adopted to fight the enemy? We chose to mainly adopt the method of armed struggle, picking up guns. In order to carry out armed struggle for a long time, it is necessary to establish revolutionary base areas. This kind of base area must be in the countryside, in the mountainous areas where the enemy's ruling power is weak. At the beginning, a base area was established in the middle section of Qiao Mountain on the border between Shaanxi and Gansu. Later, in order to gain room for maneuver in the face of the enemy's superior forces, several base areas were established in northern Shaanxi and Guanzhong. In the base areas, revolutionary regimes were established, the peasants were mobilized, and the land property of the landlords and the leased land of the rich peasants were confiscated and distributed; peasant struggles were launched, extensive guerrilla warfare was carried out, and the Red Army and militia were established, adopting guerrilla warfare tactics to fight the enemy, constantly eliminating the enemy, strengthening ourselves, and achieving victory. However, the "left"-leaning opportunists within the Party at that time opposed this practice, believing that guerrilla warfare was "flightism" and that creating guerrilla base areas was "banditry." The "left"-leaning elements wanted the Red Army to fight regular warfare, attack cities and plains, and link the Shaanxi-Gansu base area with the revolutionary movements in Sichuan, Qinghai, and Xinjiang. This was simply absurd at a time when the Red Army had only a few thousand people and was clearly at a disadvantage against the enemy.
    In order to carry out the armed struggle victoriously, it is necessary to use the greatest strength to win over allies, divide and isolate the enemy, and avoid falling into isolation ourselves. At that time, we had worked to win over many parts of the miscellaneous troops of the Northwest Army who were squeezed out by the Kuomintang Central Government, and local armed forces and gang forces who did not resolutely oppose the revolutionary movement, to make them maintain neutrality. These efforts were effective. However, the "left"-leaning opportunists said that this was "colluding with warlords." Even the policy of differentiating between landlords and rich peasants when distributing land in the base areas was regarded by them as the "rich peasant line."
    At that time, the vast majority of comrades united under the correct line led by Comrades Liu Zhidan and Gao Gang, and carried out heroic and victorious struggles. As a result, revolutionary forces were gathered, and large revolutionary base areas were established in the Shaanxi-Gansu border region and northern Shaanxi, becoming the banner of the people's liberation struggle in the Northwest. However, the tense combat environment at that time made it impossible to systematically summarize these experiences and use them to educate the entire Party. This allowed the "left"-leaning opportunists to take advantage of loopholes. They wore the cloak of Marxist-Leninist "theory," occupied the leading position in the Party several times, and adopted extremely sectarian methods, causing extremely serious damage to the revolutionary cause.
    In 1935, Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee arrived in northern Shaanxi, immediately stopped the criminal activities of the "left"-leaning opportunists, rescued the revolutionary struggle in the Northwest region, and led us to continue to advance victoriously, expanding the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region revolutionary base area. From then on, until early 1948, the Party's work in the Northwest region was under the direct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee.
    During the Anti-Japanese War, our Party once again formed a united front with the Kuomintang. At this time, the original "left"-leaning opportunists committed the mistake of right-leaning capitulationism. They not only allowed the Kuomintang reactionaries to seize many border areas of the base areas, but also advocated "everything through the united front," that is, everything through the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek, binding themselves. However, Chairman Mao pointed out this mistake in time and led us to thoroughly correct it.
    While correcting the right-leaning, Chairman Mao also prevented the "left"-leaning. In 1940, Chairman Mao led us to convene the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Assembly, established a "three-thirds system" democratic regime, and passed the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Administrative Program, which was the first complete New Democratic Administrative Program in China during the Anti-Japanese War.
    After necessary ideological and organizational preparations, the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, under the leadership of Comrade Gao Gang, convened a meeting of senior cadres of the Party in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region in 1942, and made a systematic conclusion on the history of the Party in the Northwest region in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions. This conclusion pointed out that the line led and implemented by Comrades Liu Zhidan and Gao Gang was correct, while the line of the "left"-leaning elements was an erroneous line of "left"-leaning opportunism. This meeting greatly improved the political and theoretical level of the Northwest Party.
    From the autumn of 1935 to the spring of 1948, for thirteen years, Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee lived in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. He led us, in this area with less than two million people, to educate the people, rely on the people, break the Kuomintang's military attacks and economic blockade, develop the people's production and cultural and educational undertakings, and support the national people's War of Resistance Against Japan and democratic struggle. Yan'an became a world-famous democratic holy land and the guiding center of the Chinese revolution. Chairman Mao commanded a War of Resistance Against Japan to victory here, and also commanded a People's Liberation War to victory. Chairman Mao's rich theoretical works, whether on political, military, financial and economic work, cultural thought, or philosophical issues, were mostly written here. Chairman Mao, who loved the people of the Border Region, insisted on staying in northern Shaanxi during the difficult period when the Hu and Ma bandit troops attacked the Border Region in 1947, commanding the revolutionary war in the Northwest and the whole country. Chairman Mao's insistence in northern Shaanxi greatly strengthened the fighting spirit and confidence in victory of the army and people throughout the region. It was not until after the liberation of Yan'an in 1948 and the complete retreat of the Hu and Ma bandit troops that Chairman Mao left northern Shaanxi in order to better guide the work of the whole country.
    The People's Liberation War in the Northwest region lasted for two and a half years, from the attack on Yan'an by the Hu and Ma bandit troops in March 1947 to the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang in October 1949. This war was commanded by Comrade Peng Dehuai, and correctly implemented Chairman Mao's military line. Most of the battles, such as Qinghuabian, Yangmahe, Shajiadian, Qingjian, Wazi Street, and Libei, were fought inside or on the edge of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. After entering Xi'an, the Fumei battle was fought, and then the Lanzhou battle, which basically solved the problem in the Northwest. In November 1949, under the personal direction of Comrade Peng Dehuai, an enlarged meeting of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee was held in Lanzhou, and the victory in the Northwest was estimated as follows: "The five provinces in the Northwest have been basically liberated. After more than two years of great and arduous war in the Northwest battlefield, the glorious historical task has been basically victoriously completed. This is due to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, the Central Northwest Bureau and the frontline committee of the First Field Army of the People's Liberation Army resolutely implementing the Party Central Committee's line and policies, the heroic and tenacious efforts of all commanders, fighters, and workers, the efforts of the rear support work, the support of the people in the war zone and the liberated areas, and the coordination of the troops in the liberated areas. Especially the correct leadership of the Party's wise leader Comrade Mao Zedong is the decisive factor in achieving the victory of the People's Liberation War."
    Such an estimate is completely correct. Just imagine: Without the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, without Chairman Mao's military thinking, without the ten major military principles, without Chairman Mao's personal guidance in every major battle, could we have achieved such a rapid and great victory? Didn't the fact that some of our individual parts and individual battles were not fought well just because we did not deeply understand and firmly grasp Chairman Mao's military thinking?
    After the liberation of the Northwest, we implemented the people's democratic dictatorship in the entire Northwest region in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions and in accordance with the Common Program. In about two years, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, we united the various ethnic groups, revolutionary classes, and patriotic democratic people from all walks of life, and together with them, we carried out practical and effective work in financial and economic work, people's regime construction, various democratic reforms, suppression of bandits and counter-revolutionaries, and cultural and educational work, consolidating the people's victory. Today, the atmosphere of unity and progress in the Northwest region is unprecedented in history. The face of the Northwest has changed greatly. People of all ethnic groups, revolutionary classes, and all walks of life have deeply felt this change.
    Indeed, our work has achieved great success. Especially after the three major movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the masses have risen up, and their revolutionary enthusiasm has been unprecedentedly high, and many tasks have been carried out very smoothly. What does this show? It shows that Mao Zedong Thought, once combined with the masses and grasped by the masses, will inevitably become an infinite revolutionary force. Any work that has implemented Chairman Mao's instructions, taken the policies and tasks of the Party and the People's Government to the masses, widely publicized them, carefully listened to the voices of the masses, believed in the strength of the masses, and mobilized the masses to do it together, has been victorious. On the contrary, those who adopted coercive methods went astray and suffered setbacks in ten out of ten cases. These experiences have educated many of our working cadres and made progress in their ideological style.
    Now, the work is developing forward, and the masses are progressing very quickly, which has raised many new questions for us and requires us to solve them. The Party's leadership responsibility has increased. However, most of our cadres have not received systematic theoretical education, and their understanding of Mao Zedong Thought is not deep. In the way of thinking of most cadres, the tendency of empiricism is still very common, and the problems of bureaucracy and commandism still appear frequently in their work. This state is very inconsistent with the needs of objective work. It is not that all the things that the people have asked us to do have been done well, and all the problems that they have asked us to solve have been solved, but that there are still many things that have not been done well, and there are still many important problems that have not been solved in time.
    For example, in the work of urban workers. Chairman Mao has repeatedly instructed us to attach importance to urban work and to clarify the idea of relying on the working class. We have also done a lot of work among the working masses, but the results are not great. The main reason is that we have not gone through a warm factory democratic reform movement. Now we must make up for this lesson, so that it is possible to implement a democratic style in the management of factories and enterprises and in the work of trade unions, gradually reform unreasonable systems, constantly improve the ideological consciousness of workers, do a good job in production, and appropriately improve the lives of workers on the basis of increasing production.
    Secondly, in the work of rural peasants. To lead the peasants to achieve liberation, it is necessary to implement land reform and abolish the feudal system of exploitation. All agricultural areas in the entire Northwest (including various ethnic minority areas) must complete land reform within one or two years. This is correct. However, rural work is by no means limited to land reform. All places where land reform has been completed must immediately turn to fully leading the peasants to develop production, so as to ensure the supply of food and industrial raw materials to the cities and improve the lives of the peasants themselves. This requires a series of complex, meticulous, and specific tasks to be done well. At the same time, we must never stop conducting political education among the peasant masses, and gradually improve their ideological awareness. Chairman Mao said: "The serious problem is to educate the peasants." This is a long-term and careful work that cannot be relaxed at all. In the old areas of northern Shaanxi, we have made slower progress, and the masses have criticized us. Only by earnestly doing a good job in uniting and educating workers and peasants, constantly improving the working class, leading the peasants to continue to move forward, and at the same time earnestly doing a good job in other work, especially economic work, can our worker-peasant alliance make progress, thereby enabling the people's democratic united front to make progress.
    The work in various ethnic minority areas has its own characteristics. That is: it is necessary to train a large number of local cadres and rely on cadres of their own ethnic groups to educate and mobilize the people of their own ethnic groups; all work must adopt specific steps and methods suitable for the local environment; it is necessary to organize the broadest united front, and all those who are willing to follow the Communist Party must be united with them, and one cannot easily break away from a person who should not be broken away from. These are all very important. However, the most basic work, in cities and areas with industrial economies, must be to do a good job in worker work, rely on the working class, and do a good job in production. In agricultural economic areas, it must be to mobilize peasants to implement land reform and develop agricultural production. In pastoral areas, it is also necessary to actively improve the lives of herdsmen and carry out long-term education and organization work among the working masses. Only through these efforts can the political, economic, cultural, and educational undertakings of various ethnic minorities be developed. These are all very clear.
    In order to make our work continuously advance and improve, and to always recognize the direction and path of progress, it is necessary to strive to improve the political and theoretical level of the entire Party. The way to improve is to study, that is, to organize all Party cadres and all revolutionary activists to systematically study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.
    The enemy of learning is complacency. First of all, it is necessary to earnestly eliminate the sentiments of stagnation and lack of progress that already exist within the Party, awaken everyone, and recognize the importance of learning. In accordance with the Central Committee's regulations, mobilize everyone to start systematically studying the prescribed Marxist-Leninist theoretical books and Comrade Mao Zedong's theoretical works in a planned manner. The basic method of learning is to combine theory with practice. It is necessary to greatly promote the specific application of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to solve practical problems, affirm correct things, and deny erroneous things. It is necessary to carry out necessary criticism and self-criticism in light of the shortcomings in the work. The leading organs must attach importance to summarizing the work. It is necessary to be diligent in summarizing and good at summarizing. Frequently use the vivid experiences in summarizing practical work to educate and improve all Party members. The Party committees at all levels should immediately start to strengthen the leadership of cadre education work, stipulate systems, instruct methods, diligently urge and diligently check, study and solve specific problems in this area more, and promote the theoretical study of the entire Party to rise rapidly.
    We believe that as long as the political and theoretical level of the entire Party is continuously improved, and the degree of understanding of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought by Party cadres and other revolutionary activists is continuously deepened, we will surely be able to unite the people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest, continue to do a good job in the Northwest region, and, together with the people of the whole country, build a new democratic society and advance towards our long-term goals—socialism and communism.
    Long live Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought!
    Long live the great Comrade Mao Zedong!

　　跟着毛泽东走就是胜利
   （纪念中国共产党诞生三十周年）
    习仲勋
    我们热烈庆祝中国共产党诞生三十周年，热烈庆祝毛泽东思想的胜利。
    我们中国共产党人，所以能够经过三十年艰苦卓绝的革命斗争，取得现在这样的伟大胜利，是由于有了毛泽东同志的英明领导，有了马克思列宁主义理论与中国革命实践相结合的毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想，不是别的，就是马克思列宁主义在中国革命中的新发展，它创造了世界殖民地半殖民地革命运动的典型。自从有了这个理论，中国人民革命的车轮，便一直沿着胜利的道路行进。这个理论，教育了中国共产党人，也教育了中国人民。跟着毛泽东走，就是胜利。
    在纪念中国共产党成立三十周年的时候，我想对于西北区的党的斗争的历史和现状，作一个扼要的说明。
    中国共产党所领导的革命斗争，从一九二二至一九二三年间，就在西北开始了。起初，是由少数的共产党员和共产主义者，在关中、陕北等地学校中，传播马克思主义思想，建立和发展了共产党的组织。有了这个条件，就使一九二六至二七年的大革命期间，西北革命运动以西安为中心，有很大发展。当时，我们曾与国民党进步势力结成统一战线，在军队、政权、文化教育和群众运动方面，都做了很多工作，党员发展到几千人。但是，当时的领导者，不懂得国民党右派的反动本质，没有应付突然事变的准备，犯了右倾机会主义。一九二七年夏，国民党的郑州会议一开，国民党反革命了，杀的杀，赶的赶，共产党和革命人民遭受极严重的损失。
    共产党人，并不灰心丧气，重新集合起来，与敌人战斗。而且，以刘志丹同志和高岗同志为首，从一九二七年大革命失败后到一九三五年的八个年头内，在与敌人斗争中，与党内机会主义斗争中，找到了一条正确的路线。这个斗争，是在毛泽东同志和朱德同志在南方发展革命武装与建立革命根据地的号召和影响下进行的。
    与敌人斗争，主要的是要采用什么方式？我们选定了主要的采取武装斗争的方式，拿起枪杆子。为着长期地进行武装斗争，就要建立革命根据地。这种根据地，又必须是在乡村，在敌人统治力量薄弱的山地。开始是在陕、甘边的桥山中段建立了一处根据地，以后，为了在敌人优势兵力面前，获得回旋余地，便在陕北、关中建立了几处根据地。在根据地里，建立了革命政权，发动了农民，没收了地主的土地财产及富农的出租土地，加以分配；发动了农民斗争，开展广泛的游击战争，并建立了红军和赤卫队（即民兵），采取游击战争的战法，和敌人作战，不断的消灭敌人，壮大自己，取得胜利。但当时党内“左”倾机会主义者，却反对这种做法，认为打游击战是“逃跑主义”认为创造游击根据地是“梢山主义”。“左”倾分子要红军打正规战，向城市和平川出击，把陕、甘根据地和四川、青海、新疆的革命运动联系起来。这在当时红军只有几千人，对敌人显然占劣势的情况下，简直是荒谬绝伦的。
    为了胜利地进行武装斗争，就必须用最大力量，去争取同盟者，分化和孤立敌人，而避免自己陷于孤立。当时，我们曾经对那些受国民党中央排挤的杂牌军即西北军的许多部分，对那些不坚决反对革命运动的地方团队和帮会势力，做争取工作，使他们守中立。这些工作是有成效的。但“左”倾机会主义者，却说这是“勾结军阀”。连在根据地内分配土地时，对待地主与富农加以区别的政策，也被他们认作是“富农路线”。
    当时，绝大多数同志都团结在刘志丹同志和高岗同志领导的正确路线下，进行了英勇的胜利的斗争。其结果，是聚集了革命力量，建立了陕、甘边和陕北的大块革命根据地，成为西北人民解放斗争的旗帜。可是当时紧张的战斗环境，还没有可能把这些经验都系统地总结起来，并用以教育全党。这就使“左”倾机会主义者钻了空子。他们披着马克思列宁主义“理论”的外衣，几度占据了党内的领导地位，并采取极端宗派主义的方法，给了革命事业极严重的损害。
    一九三五年毛主席和党中央到了陕北，立即制止了“左”倾机会主义者的罪恶活动，挽救了西北区的革命斗争，并领导着我们继续胜利前进，扩大了陕甘宁边区革命根据地。从此以后，直到一九四八年初，西北区的党的工作，就一直在毛主席和党中央的直接领导之下。
    在抗日战争时期，我党再次与国民党结成统一战线。这时原来的“左”倾机会主义者，却又犯了右倾投降主义的错误。他们不仅把根据地的许多边沿地区，听任国民党反动派抢去，而且提倡“一切经过统一战线”，即一切经过国民党蒋介石，把自己束缚起来。但是毛主席及时地指出这个错误，领导我们把它彻底纠正了。
    毛主席在纠正右倾的同时，又防止了“左”倾。在一九四零年，毛主席领导我们召开了陕甘宁边区参议会，建立了“三三制”的民主政权，并通过陕甘宁边区施政纲领，这是抗日战争时期中国第一个完备的新民主主义的施政纲领。
    此后，经过了必要的思想准备和组织准备，中共中央西北局在高岗同志领导下，在一九四二年召开了陕甘宁边区党的高级干部会议，按照毛主席的指示，对西北区党内的历史，做出了系统的结论。这个结论指出：刘志丹同志和高岗同志所领导执行的路线是正确的，而“左”倾分子的路线乃是“左”倾机会主义的错误路线。这个会议，把西北党的政治理论水平大大提高了一步。
    从一九三五年秋季，到一九四八年春季，这十三个年头内，毛主席和党中央一直住在陕甘宁边区。他领导着我们，在这不足二百万人口的地区，教育人民，依靠人民，打破了国民党的军事进攻和经济封锁，发展了人民的生产和文化教育事业，支援了全国人民的抗日战争和民主斗争。延安，成为世界闻名的民主圣地，成为中国革命的指导中心。毛主席在这里，指挥了一个抗日战争到胜利，又指挥了一个人民解放战争走向胜利。毛主席的丰富的理论著作，无论是关于政治的、军事的、财政经济工作的、文化思想的、以及哲学问题的，大部分都是在这里写出的。热爱边区人民的毛主席，当一九四七年胡、马匪军进攻边区的困难时期，坚持留在陕北，指挥西北和全国的革命战争。毛主席在陕北的坚持，极大地加强了全区军民的斗志和胜利信心。直到一九四八年延安光复，胡、马匪军全线溃退之后，毛主席才为了更好地指导全国工作，离开了陕北。
    西北区的人民解放战争，从一九四七年三月胡、马匪军进攻延安算起，到一九四九年十月新疆和平解放，共两年半的时间。这个战争是由彭德怀同志指挥的，是正确地执行了毛主席的军事路线的。其中大部分的战役，如青化砭、羊马河、沙家店、清涧、瓦子街、荔北等战役，都是在陕甘宁边区内部或边沿打的。进入西安后，打了一个扶郿战役，再一个兰州战役，便基本上解决了西北的问题。一九四九年十一月，由彭德怀同志亲自主持，在兰州召开中共中央西北局的扩大会议，对西北区的胜利，作了这样的估计：“西北五省已基本解放。西北战场经过两年多伟大而艰苦的战争，已基本上胜利地完成了光荣的历史任务。这是由于毛主席和党中央领导的正确，中央西北局和人民解放军第一野战军前线委员会坚决执行党中央的路线和政策，全体指战员工作员的英勇顽强，后方支前工作的努力，战区和解放区人民的拥护，以及各解放区部队的配合所获得的成果。尤其是党的英明领袖毛泽东同志的正确领导，是取得人民解放战争胜利的决定因素。”
    这样的估计，是完全正确的。试想：如果没有毛主席和党中央的正确领导，没有毛主席的军事思想，没有十大军事原则，没有历次重大战役中毛主席的亲自指导，我们能够得到这样迅速这样伟大的胜利么？我们曾有个别的部分，个别的战役，打得不好，不就是因为对于毛主席的军事思想体会不深，掌握不紧的原故吗？
    西北解放后，我们按照毛主席的指示，按照共同纲领，在西北全区实施了人民民主专政，在两年左右的时间内，我们在毛主席和党中央的领导下，团结了各民族、各革命阶级以及各方面的爱国民主人士，和他们一道，在财政经济工作方面，人民政权建设方面，各项民主改革方面，剿匪和镇压反革命方面，以及文化教育工作等等方面，都开展了切实的有效的工作，巩固了人民的胜利。今天，西北区团结、进步的气象，是历史上从来未有过的。西北的面貌是大大地改变了。各民族、各革命阶级和各方面的人们都已经深刻地感觉到了这种变化。
    的确，我们的工作，是获得了很大的成绩。特别是经过抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命三大运动，群众起来了，革命热情空前高涨，很多工作都进行得非常顺利。这是说明什么呢？说明了：毛泽东思想，一经和群众结合，掌握了群众，就必然变成无穷尽的革命力量。任何工作，凡是执行了毛主席的指示，把党和人民政府的政策、任务，拿到群众中去，广泛宣传，细心听取群众的呼声，相信群众力量，动员群众一块去做的，都胜利了。而和上面所说相反，采取强迫命令办法的，十个就有十个，都走了弯路，栽了跟头。这些经验，教育了我们许多工作干部，使他们的思想作风有了进步。
    现在，工作向前发展，群众进步很快，给我们提出了很多新的问题，要求我们解决。党的领导责任是加重了。但是，我们大多数干部没有受过系统的理论教育，对毛泽东思想的领会不深。在多数干部的思想方法上，经验主义倾向还很普遍，工作上官僚主义、命令主义的毛病还时常出现。这种状态，是与客观工作的需要，十分不相称的。并不是人民要求我们做的事情，都做好了，要求我们解决的问题，都解决了，而是还有很多事情没有做好，有很多重要问题，没有及时地加以解决。
    例如说城市工人工作方面。毛主席一再指示我们，要重视城市工作，要明确依靠工人阶级的思想。我们在工人群众中，也做过不少工作，但成绩不大，主要的，就是没有经过一个热烈的工厂民主改革运动。现在必须补上这一课，才有可能在工厂企业管理工作中，在工会工作中，贯彻民主作风，逐步改革不合理的制度，不断提高工人思想觉悟，搞好生产，并在增加生产的基础上适当改善工人生活。
    其次，是乡村农民工作方面。要领导农民获得解放，就必须实行土地改革，废除封建剥削制度。全西北的一切农业地区（包括各少数民族地区在内），都要在一、二年内，完成土地改革。这是正确的。但是，农村的工作，决不止于土地改革。一切完成了土地改革的地方，要立即转到全力领导农民发展生产，以保证城市粮食和工业原料的供给，并改善农民自己的生活。这就要做好一系列的复杂的细致的具体工作。同时，要一刻也不停止地向农民群众进行政治教育，逐步提高他们的思想觉悟。毛主席说：“严重的问题是教育农民。”这是一个长期的细心的工作，一点也放松不得的。陕北老区，我们进步慢了些，群众就批评我们。只有切实做好团结和教育工人、农民的工作，不断提高工人阶级，领导农民继续前进，同时，又切实做好其他的工作，特别是经济工作，才能使我们的工农联盟获得前进，从而使人民民主统一战线获得前进。
    在各少数民族地区的工作，是有其特点的。这就是：必须大量培养当地干部，依靠本民族的干部，去教育和发动本民族的人民；一切的工作，都要采用适合当地环境的具体步骤和方法；要组织最广泛的统一战线，一切愿意跟着共产党走的人，都要团结他们，不能轻易脱离一个不应脱离的人。这些，都是十分重要的。但是，最基本的工作，在城市及有工业经济的地区，必须是做好工人工作，依靠工人阶级，搞好生产。在农业经济地区，必须是发动农民实行土地改革，发展农业生产。在游牧区，也要积极改善牧民生活，向劳动群众进行长期的教育组织工作。经过这些工作，才能发展各少数民族的政治、经济及文化教育事业。这都是很明白的。
    要使我们的工作不断地前进和提高，时刻认清前进的方向和道路，就必须努力提高全党的政治理论水平。提高的办法，就是学习，就是组织全党干部和所有革命积极分子系统地学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想。
    学习的敌人是自满，首先要认真清除党内已经存在的停顿起来不求进步的情绪，唤醒大家，认识学习的重要性。按照中央的规定，动员大家开始有计划地学习规定的马克思列宁主义理论书籍和毛泽东同志的理论著作。学习的基本方法，是理论与实际相联系。要大大提倡具体应用马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，去解决实际问题，肯定正确的东西，否定错误的东西。要针对工作中的缺点，开展必要的批评与自我批评。领导机关必须重视总结工作。要勤于总结，善于总结。经常用总结实际工作中的生动经验，教育和提高全体党员。各级党委应即着手加强对干部教育工作的领导，规定制度，指示办法，勤督促，勤检查，多多研究和解决这个方面的具体问题，推动全党的理论学习迅速高涨起来。
    我们相信：只要全党政治理论水平不断地提高起来，党的干部和其他的革命积极分子对马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的领会程度不断地加深起来，就一定能够团结西北各族人民，继续做好西北地区的工作，与全国人民一起，建设新民主主义社会并向我们的远大目标——社会主义和共产主义社会前进。
    马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想胜利万岁！
    伟大的毛泽东同志万岁！
