Reply to Opinions on the Comic Book "Young Master Soldiers"

To the Editorial Department:
    In the "Readers' Letters" column on page five of your newspaper on June 25th, Comrade Li Xichang from the Mentougou Cultural Center expressed his opinion on the comic book "Young Master Soldiers," which our store was selling and which contains pro-American viewpoints. We believe this opinion is very valuable. As a state-owned bookstore, we should not sell such books and periodicals that are harmful to the people. In addition to sincerely accepting the criticism and ceasing to sell the book, we will certainly be more conscientious and responsible in the selection of books and periodicals for sale in the future, and strive to completely eliminate the occurrence of similar incidents.

### 对连环画《少爷兵》的意见的答复

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　对连环画《少爷兵》的意见的答复编辑同志：
    六月二十五日贵报第五版“读者来信”栏载有门头沟文化馆李希昌同志对我店代售有崇美观点的连环画《少爷兵》的意见，我们觉得这个意见是非常宝贵的。作为一个国营书店来讲，是不应该代售这种对人民有害的书刊的，除诚恳接受批评并停止出售该书外，今后一定在代售书刊的选择工作上更加认真负责，努力作到根绝类似事情的发生。
