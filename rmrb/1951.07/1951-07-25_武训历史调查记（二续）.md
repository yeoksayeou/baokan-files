　　A Continued Investigation into the History of Wu Xun

　　(II) Wu Xun's Character

　　Wu Xun was born into a poor peasant family. He had two older brothers (Wu Qian, Wu Rang) and four older sisters. He was the seventh child, nicknamed Wu Qi. We examined the ancestral tablets of the Wu family at the home of Wu Jinxing, Wu Xun's great-great-nephew in Wu Village, Tangyi, and learned that Wu Xun's father, Wu Zongyu, died in the twenty-fifth year of the Daoguang reign (1845), and his mother, Cui, did not die until the twelfth year of the Tongzhi reign (1873). At that time, Wu Xun was already thirty-five years old, not as many biographies and the film depict, with Wu Xun's mother dying when he was young. It is evident that what the working people said, that Wu Xun did not care for his family and mother after he became successful, aligns with the facts.

　　When his family was struggling, Wu Xun followed his mother to beg for food. Although he was not a professional beggar at that time, he developed a vagrant habit of not caring about farm work and not loving labor. When he was sixteen or seventeen years old, his mother managed to get him to work at Zhang Bianzheng's house in Xuedian, Guantao, but he lacked even the basic knowledge of farm work. Wang Tangchuan (75 years old, middle peasant) from Cuizhuang (his mother's family village) said: "Doumo [Wu Xun's nickname] didn't understand farm work, he couldn't even tell the difference between soybeans and cotton. Once, he was asked to pick cotton tips in the field, but he cut off the soybean tips instead."

　　Zhang Bianzheng, also known as Zhang Lao Bian or Zhang Lao Bianzi, was a distant uncle of Wu Xun and a *gongshi* (a tribute student). He owned four or five *qing* of land and hired several people to farm it. Zhang Xiaofeng (74 years old, poor peasant) from Xuedian said: "Wu Qi didn't really work, his aunt's family treated him as a relative. He couldn't do anything, he couldn't spread manure or chop straw. He couldn't push a cart straight, it would wobble, and he didn't use his hands to carry water, he just sauntered along." Therefore, Zhang Lao Bian only asked him to watch the "tree line" (orchard) or do some light work like feeding pigs and livestock. As for his wages, the old people in Xuedian said that it was at most the standard of "three whips"—four strings of cash. At that time, the annual wage for "head whip" (the strongest laborer) was eight or nine strings, and the wage for "second whip" was five or six strings. If we follow the masses in Xuedian, Wu Xun only worked at Zhang Lao Bian's house for one year, so the wage was at most four strings; if we follow the masses in Tangyi, who say he worked for two years, then the wage was at most eight strings. Did Zhang Lao Bian cheat him out of this wage? The masses have different opinions. Some say it was given to his brother, some say it was given to him, and some say it was not given at all, with more saying it was given to him. Zhang Shizhen (50 years old, poor peasant) from Xuedian said: "Wu Qi only worked for one year, the wage was very small, and his brother took it away. Wu Qi made a big fuss and left, never working again."

　　After our extensive investigation, we could not find any other family besides Zhang Lao Bian's where Wu Xun had worked. There was no other "Zhang *juren*" (a successful candidate in the imperial examinations at the provincial level), and no other "Li Lao Bianzi." In Wu Xun's fifty-nine years of life, there was only one year (or two years) that could be said to be "labor," and nothing else.

　　After Wu Xun returned home from Zhang Lao Bian's, he had a conflict with his mother and brothers over whether to work or beg in the future. Wu Jinxing said: "My great-grandmother and my great-grandfather both wanted him to work, they didn't want him to be a beggar." But Wu Xun believed that begging was more comfortable than working, "better to beg and be free." He swore: "I'm leaving home, don't bother me!" From then on, he broke away from his poor peasant family, abandoned the working people, and "became a big beggar" (Wu Jinxing). No wonder the feudal ruling class praised his so-called "cutting off all relations with relatives and friends" attitude, because in reality, it meant he had "cut off all relations" with the working people. From that time on, he only associated with ruffians, bachelors, landlords, bullies, rich monks, and officials of all sizes. The local masses said that when he was young, he liked to go to Cuizhuang to find his uncle, Cui Lao Hua, who was a famous rogue, "he only ate other people's food." Wang Tangchuan said that Cui Lao Hua had worked as the "chief of the tax office" in the yamen, and Wu Xun got along with him the best. It is conceivable that Wu Xun learned a lot of "only eating other people's food" skills from Cui Lao Hua. Later, Wu Xun begged in many counties, befriended ruffians from various counties, and became a powerful leader of ruffians.

　　Wu Xun was already a young man of nearly twenty when he officially started begging. According to the social habit of despising those who do not work for a living, a person as young and strong as him would not receive sympathy for begging, and not many people would give him anything. Therefore, in order to achieve the goal of not working for a living, his first method was to pretend to be crazy and act foolish. Zhang Honglu (86 years old, middle peasant) from Furenzhai, Tangyi, said: "Doumo was so strong!" He gestured with his hands and said: "His face was this wide, his waist was as thick as a chopping board!" We asked: Why would people give alms to such a strong person? Zhang Honglu said: "He was crazy!" But others said: "He was crazy, but he wasn't confused about money." This means that people understood he was pretending to be crazy, and not many people were fooled.

　　Since pretending to be crazy could not deceive people for long, he later came up with a brilliant method, putting up the signboard of "establishing free schools." But "free schools" were not his invention, let alone something he came up with after some mysterious "three-day dream." "Free schools" existed before Wu Xun. According to the "Linqing County Gazetteer": "The establishment of free schools began in the early Qing Dynasty, expanding gradually from the city to the countryside" (Volume 3, page 11). The vast majority of these "free schools" were established by the Manchu Qing Dynasty. From the Kangxi to the Qianlong reigns, there were nine "free schools" in Linqing, only three of which were privately established (donated by gentry), and the rest were "officially established" by the prefect. By the Guangxu reign, the number of "free schools" in Linqing had increased to twenty-five. It can be seen that the more it came to the later years, the more the Manchu Qing autocratic rulers loved to "establish free schools," and "free schools" developed more in that area. The same was true in Tangyi and Guantao. In the villages of Xiaoji, Yanglin, and Qianhuji, which Wu Xun frequented, "free schools" had already existed before Wu Xun. Wu Xun begged and traveled everywhere, and came into contact with the upper echelons of feudal society, and realized that putting up the signboard of "establishing free schools" would definitely benefit him. Sure enough, once this signboard was raised, it was appreciated by the landlord class, and the *wujinshi* (martial graduate) Lou Junling from Louta, Guantao County, immediately took a liking to him. The local masses said that Lou *jinshi* did not praise anyone, but said: "Wu Qi can accomplish great things."

　　Wu Xun used many methods to pretend to be crazy and act foolish to cheat money, but he had a basic principle, which was that his attitude towards landlords was different from his attitude towards working people. He kowtowed everywhere to the landlord class, calling them "old grandfathers" and "old grandmothers," or "grandfathers" and "grandmothers." He called the children of landlords "little uncles" and "little aunts." The landlords of Tangyi and Guantao said that Wu Xun had a "sweet mouth!" "He has a good temper, he doesn't get angry no matter how you play with him." What about the working people? Tang Qinxie (75 years old, new middle peasant), Wu Xun's grandson, said that once Wu Xun took a few apricots to his house and gave them to Tang Qinxie's brothers. Tang Qinxie and his brothers thought they were given by their great-uncle and ate them. As soon as they finished eating, Wu Xun reached out for money. Zhang Honglu said: "Don't let Doumo put anything down, whatever he puts down, it will increase. He put down two *sheng* of red sorghum at my house, and the next day when he came to take it, he wanted it to increase." Shi Donghai (74 years old, poor peasant) said: "Whoever touches him will be harmed." "Putting money out at 700 *wen* to a *diao*."

　　Since Wu Xun officially started begging, did he do work such as spreading manure, chopping straw, pulling rollers, ginning cotton, spinning thread, and grinding mills as his propagandists said? According to our investigation, he did none of those except chopping straw and grinding mills. And even chopping straw and grinding mills were just performances when he was begging, with the purpose of reaching out for money or asking for dry food. We asked dozens of old people, and only two said they had seen him grinding mills. One of them said that he put a "donkey blindfold" on when grinding mills, and when many children gathered around to watch him, he would imitate the braying of a donkey. Lu Yanlin, a 103-year-old man from Lianerzhai, said: "I only heard him shouting 'grinding mills,' I never saw him really grinding." When we interviewed Zhang Chunhua (83 years old, middle peasant) from the same village about Wu Xun's labor in those years, as soon as we mentioned chopping straw, he said: "Chopping straw, chopping straw, no one comes to find." This is the working people's evaluation of Wu Xun, and it should be said that it is very appropriate. Even Wu Xun's own family members, Wu Keke (78 years old, middle peasant) and Wu Jie (70 years old, middle peasant), said: "Begging is his main business, working is rare."

　　While shouting "establishing schools," Wu Xun pretended to be crazy and foolish, using all kinds of tricks and scams to extort the blood and sweat from the working people. He gave his first sum of money (according to the masses in Guantao, it was forty or fifty *diao*) to Lou Junling, the martial graduate from Guantao, to lend out at an interest rate of three percent. Wu Xun realized that lending money "increased" quickly, so he went home and demanded to sell land. Guo Chunxu, the magistrate of Tangyi County, said in his "Orthodox Monument Inscription for Free Schools": "In the early years of the Tongzhi reign, he sold three *mu* of his pre-divided land for 120,000 cash." In fact, the people of Wuzhuang and Wu Jinxing said that the sale of land was true, but they did not divide the family property, and it was not three *mu* that was sold. Wu Jinxing said: "My family would rather die than sell land, but he sold five point seven *mu*." Wu Xun and his three brothers shared twelve *mu* of land, and his share was four *mu*, so how could he sell five point seven *mu*? It is said that his reason was that he had not married, but Wu Jinxing said that it was more important that they were afraid of his fierceness, so they had to obey him. Wu Xun added the money from the sale of land to the interest earned from lending, and with the help of the big bully Yang Shufang and others to lend money, his property accumulated more and more. Zhang Honglu said: "Doumo wouldn't even keep 500 cash on his person, he would watch it increase every other day." If they didn't give it to him, he would kneel down, and if they couldn't pay it back, he would say that they had "cheated" (meaning to default on debt) his "free school" money. In this way, Wu Xun quickly became a landlord through the path of usury. Some farmers could not repay his high-interest loans and gave him their land; some farmers could not pay their rent and mortgaged their land to him. In this way, his land and the amount of his usury gradually increased, eventually reaching 17,000 *diao* ("Linqing County Gazetteer," Volume 12, pages 90-91). Wu Xun finally got his wish, raising the banner of "establishing schools," wearing the clothes of a beggar, and climbing into the ranks of the exploiting class.

　　The base for Wu Xun's Liulin "Free School" was donated by Guo Fen, a small landlord. Why was Guo Fen willing to donate this piece of land? Guo Peixian (73 years old, new middle peasant), a member of Guo Fen's family, told us this story: Guo Fen did not believe that Wu Doumo was really running a school. One day, he ran into Doumo and asked: "Doumo, you've been shouting about establishing schools for decades, why haven't you done it?" Wu Xun said: "I don't have land to build a house." Guo Fen said: "It's easy to get land, I have land outside the east gate." Wu Xun had nothing to say, kowtowed and left. Later, Yang Shufang talked to Wu Xun, and Wu Xun had to agree, which "Liu Bei proposed to marry Sun Quan's sister, making a fake into reality." Under the orders of Yang Shufang and others, in the year Wu Xun was fifty-one years old, that is, thirty years after he raised the banner of "establishing schools" at the age of twenty-one, he and Yang Shufang jointly established the "Chongxian Free School" in Liulin Town.

　　Since this school was established, Wu Xun has not only been the leader of ruffians and a regular guest of landlords, but also an honored guest of the government. Guo Chunxu, the magistrate of Tangyi County, invited him to dinner, and Zhang Yao, the Shandong governor, summoned him. At Guo Chunxu's banquet, Wu Xun proudly sang: "Take off your hat, put out the fire, I'm the one who establishes free schools." Why did Guo Chunxu want to get to know Wu Xun? Ni Zhanyun, an 81-year-old former student of the Liulin "Free School," told us: Guo Chunxu's nickname was Guo Hutu (Guo Confused). He was about to lose his job because of something, but suddenly discovered Wu Xun and hurriedly reported it, thus gaining merit and keeping his official hat.

　　Following the Liulin "Free School," Wu Xun also established the "Free School" in Yang'erzhuang, Guantao County, but Wu Xun contributed less money, mainly using the temple property of the monk Liao Zheng. Speaking of the monk Liao Zheng, he was also a character quite similar to Wu Xun. He was also born into a poor family, but after becoming a monk, he went to Beijing to network. After returning to Guantao, he gradually took charge of the temple property of three temples. The temple property of Xiliuzhuang alone had 170 *mu* of land. In addition to land, Liao Zheng also lent out more than 4,000 *diao* of money at high interest. Although he was a big landlord and a big usurer, he also practiced a *bitter meat strategy* like Wu Xun, deliberately "wearing the same cotton pants for nine years." Towards his own poor family members, he would not "lend even half a bowl of *sheng*." According to the masses, Wu Xun became Liao Zheng's disciple around the age of thirty, in order to get his hands on Liao Zheng's money, while Liao Zheng used Wu Xun's reputation and influence to collude with the government, using the establishment of schools to protect the temple property. They combined in this way to establish the Yang'erzhuang "Free School."

　　As for Wu Xun's third school in Linqing, it was under the control of Shi Shanzheng, a big bully and the leader of a secret society in Linqing. It was only opened the year Wu Xun died, and Wu Xun died as soon as it opened.

　　Wu Xun's propagandists are happy to praise Wu Xun's "filial piety" and "friendship," and we have also investigated this matter. Contrary to this praise, Wu Xun was an unfilial and unfriendly person. In order to not engage in honest work and become a rogue, Wu Xun had long broken with his family. In order to sell the property, he had a big fight with his brother. Guo Jiwu, 79 years old, said: "His mother and brother didn't benefit from him, and his mother's death was not like a dog's death." Someone said that his brother asked him to go back for the funeral when his mother died, but he said he wouldn't go if there was no "crying money." This may be true, as Wu Xun was suffering from a money-obsessed disease. The masses said that Wu Xun would take the dry food he begged for and sell it to people to feed livestock, but he would not give his mother and brother a bite to eat. He was such a ruthless and unrighteous person.

　　Li Shizhao said in his "Wu Xun Painting Biography" that "Wu Xun released forty *shi* of red sorghum to relieve disaster victims in order to promote a high degree of class friendship." After our extensive investigation, the masses said that this was not the case.

　　Regarding the story of Wu Xun not marrying a wife, Wu Xun's propagandists also consider it an important "ascetic practice." According to our investigation, Wu Xun did not marry a wife, but he worshiped many women as his so-called "godmothers." Chen Daiqing, a Wu Xun propagandist in the late Qing Dynasty, said in his "Wu Qi" article in the "Shenjiezai Wen Cun" volume: "In the years before Wu Qi died, whenever he saw a young woman, he would kowtow and beg to be her adopted son. When someone was surprised and questioned him, he would say: I am punished by heaven to be a cold beggar, and I am illiterate. My life is already over, I wish to be born in a good place with blessings to study in the next life." Why must he worship a godmother to cultivate the next life, and why must he worship a young godmother? This makes it difficult for people to understand. But Wu Xun used superstitious words to cover up his behavior of worshiping godmothers, to deal with those who were "surprised and questioned," this is possible. Luo Zhengjun, the Shandong Education Commissioner in the late Qing Dynasty, compiled "The Complete Account of the Beggar Wu Xun Establishing Schools," which included Chen Daiqing's article, renamed "A Short Biography of Wu Qi," but deleted this paragraph. Guo Jintang, the principal of Linqing Wu Xun Primary School and a member of the Kuomintang, also did the same in the "Commemorative Album for Mr. Wu Xun's Ninety-Seventh Birthday" in 1934. This should be the reason for these Wu Xun propagandists' so-called "concealing things for the virtuous," believing that if this point is not deleted, Wu Xun would not appear to be a complete "saint." But "seeing a young woman every few years before death" is not very accurate either. According to the masses, Wu Doumo worshiped many young or middle-aged widows who he selected as godmothers throughout his life. Wu Xun himself also openly sang: "Say a hundred matchmakers, recognize a hundred godmothers, eat a bite of mama, die on the side of the road" ("eating mama" means breastfeeding). Wu Xun had a godmother in Linqing in his later years, who is now over seventy years old, a widow in her youth, who gave birth to a child. People rushed to call him "Little Doumo." When we visited Wuzhuang, we saw an old lady in her eighties, who did not hide her relationship with Wu Xun, saying that Doumo had eaten her "mama." Wu Jinxing's wife, who was present, was angry and said, "Why are you saying this!" The old lady said, "Why can't I say it, people (referring to Wu Xun) are not ordinary people!" In her mind, Wu Xun had not only become famous, but also become a god, and she felt that she was honored to have this kind of relationship with Wu Xun. But this person was not Wu Xun's "godmother," but his cousin's wife, who was widowed when she was young.

　　Wu Xun, who became rich after the age of forty-two, still wore a beggar's clothes and traveled between Tangyi, Linqing, Guantao, and Guan County, but he was no longer a beggar, but a big usurer and a big landlord. Yang Guanghan (70 years old, landlord), the grandson of Yang Shufang, said: "Wu Xun's work in his later years mainly consisted of urging rent, collecting interest, inspecting schools, carrying a donation book established for him by the gentry of various counties to solicit donations, and selling 'Good Books' such as 'Tai Shang Gan Ying Pian,' 'Yin Zhi Wen,' 'Zao Wang Jing,' and 'Quan Shi Wen.'"

　　Sun Yu and Li Shizhao both said that Wu Xun opposed building memorial archways. According to our investigation, there was indeed no memorial archway, only a plaque with the words "Happy to Do Good and Give Alms." We took a picture of it. The basis for Sun Yu and Li Shizhao's statement was probably because Guo Chunxu said in his "Detailed Report on the Initial Request for Awards" ("The Complete Account of Establishing Schools," hereinafter referred to as the same book): "This case deserves an award and could have been used to build an archway. However, the villagers do not like fame, and even if it is approved, they will not do so, which means that this grand ceremony is still a formality. In the future, I plan to follow the award plan and change to giving a plaque to hang in the free school, and declare it jointly." We believe that this "statement" has a reason. Guo Chunxu was only speaking for Yang Shufang, who did not want Wu Xun to build an archway. Because in the society at that time, building an archway had a great impact, and it must be built in Wuzhuang and separated from the Liulin "Free School," which was very unfavorable to Yang Shufang. A plaque has less impact and can be "hung in the free school," which is more beneficial to Yang Shufang. Later, Zhang Yao did not listen to Guo Chunxu and still requested the Qing Emperor to "approve the construction of an archway by Wu Qi, a resident of Tangyi County, and grant the words 'Happy to Do Good and Give Alms,'" and it was approved. But this conflicted with Yang Shufang's interests and could not be implemented after all, so it was only a plaque and no archway. Why is building an archway considered "liking fame," while hanging a plaque is not considered "liking fame"? This does not make sense, so Sun Yu and Li Shizhao simply concealed this story of hanging a plaque and said that Wu Xun opposed building an archway and opposed accepting the Qing Emperor's honor. But the local masses said that Wu Xun had people carry this plaque through the streets of Liulin Town for several days. After Wu Xun's death, the Wu family and the Yang family continued to fight, and the Wu family was persecuted to death by the Yang family. These two lives were Wu Maolin, Wu Xun's assistant (this person appeared in Sun Yu's film), and Wu Lulin, Wu Xun's adopted grandson. Later, the Wu family snatched the "Happy to Do Good and Give Alms" plaque from the Liulin School in the dark of night and hung it in the Wu family in Wuzhuang. We saw this plaque in Wu Jinxing's home, and heard the story of Yang's victory and Wu's defeat and the "final victory" of snatching the plaque in the dark of night from Wu Jinxing and the masses of Liulin and Wuzhuang.

　　Even during Wu Xun's lifetime, there were still contradictions between Wu Xun, this rogue landlord, and his cooperating great landlord friends. We can see that there used to be great contradictions between them. They made use of each other. When it came to a conflict of interest, Wu Xun could not beat them, and always made concessions and compromises, but he was not willing in his heart. According to the masses, Wu Xun really wanted to build a ancestral hall for himself after his death, but Yang Shufang was unwilling. Wu Maolin, Wu Xun's loyal assistant, felt bad about it, and he also wanted to inherit Wu Xun's career of begging to establish schools after Wu Xun's death, so he said to Wu Xun: After you die, I will definitely build an ancestral hall for you. Wu Xun immediately jumped off the bed and kowtowed to Wu Maolin, expressing his gratitude and entrustment. This happened not long before Wu Xun's death. Because Wu Maolin had managed Wu Xun's property, and after the Liulin School was established, he could still represent Wu Xun and the people sent by the Yang family to jointly manage the school's property. In addition, Wu Xun may have still had a portion of private property that had not been handed over to the school, such as certain real estate and certain loans, which were managed by him. Therefore, as soon as Wu Xun died, Wu Maolin built the ancestral hall despite Yang Shufang's opposition. The masses said that Yang Shufang's opposition was very firm, saying that "the money belongs to the free school, and cannot be used to build an ancestral hall," and did not allow Wu Maolin to interfere with Wu Xun's property and the school. But Wu Maolin still wanted to build it. If he didn't have money, he would buy materials on credit from merchants and start construction. The ancestral hall was actually built. Yang Shufang firmly refused to acknowledge it, claiming that Wu Maolin had nothing to do with the "free school." As a result, the people who sold materials on credit and the contractors panicked, and everyone asked Wu Maolin for money. Yang Shufang also threatened Wu Maolin, saying that the merchants were going to sue him in the county. Only then did Wu Maolin realize that he had entered a dead end, and hanged himself at the entrance of the Wu Xun ancestral hall. The masses believed that Wu Maolin was also a rogue, but they expressed great sympathy for his pitiful death. They all said in unison: Wu Maolin was "forced to death by the Yang family." Only Mu Zhongshan (66 years old, used to be a landlord and is now a middle peasant), who served as a director of the Wu Xun School in 1913, put forward a different opinion. He said: The rogue Wu Maolin had nothing to do with Wu Xun, and had never even done errand work. He died because he wanted to die himself, and no one forced him. We believe that this statement obviously distorts the facts. Mu Zhongshan also said that Wu Maolin made two ancestral tablets before his death and put them in the ancestral hall, one written with Wu Xun's name and the other with Wu Maolin's own name, and then he hanged himself. We believe that this may be true, because Wu Maolin regarded himself as Wu Xun's successor, and Wu Xun may have entrusted him with this during his lifetime. Although Wu Xun cooperated with Yang Shufang, there were great contradictions, and Wu Xun believed that only people like Wu Maolin were the most reliable.

　　Wu Maolin was Wu Xun's distant great-nephew, and he helped Wu Xun with his so-called begging to establish schools throughout his life. As a result, he was forced to death by Yang Shufang. Wu Lulin was the grandson of Wu Qian and the son of Wu Kexin. In his later years, Wu Xun adopted Wu Lulin as his grandson. The Yang family accused him of "resisting the payment of school rent." The county magistrate arrested him, tortured him severely, and released him. He died the next day. We said earlier that Wu Xun did not care for his family. This was the case in his youth and middle age. In his old age, probably dissatisfied with Yang Shufang's excessive control, and at the same time dissatisfied with social opinion, he still requested the Yang family to allow the allocation of more than forty *mu* of land to Wu Kexin, Wu Lulin's father, in the name of Wu family sacrificial land, and at the same time satisfied the Yang family with the condition of paying ten strings of rent to the school every year. This matter was recorded in the official yamen (see the Complete Account of Establishing Schools, which says it was forty *mu*, but Wu Jinxing told us it was more than forty *mu*). But the Yang family later forcibly took it back, denying that it was sacrificial land, insisting that it was school land, and sent Wu Lulin to deliver heavy rent. Wu Lulin could not afford it, and a dispute occurred. Therefore, the person was beaten to death alive, and the land was taken away. This is the public case of the Wu family's "two lives." The masses generally sympathized with the Wu family in this matter. When Wu Jinxing told us about these things, we and he both felt sad. Wu Jinxing said sadly: "We have a feud with the Yang family!"

　　Regarding the issue of Wu Xun's rogue gang, the issue of whether Wu Xun had private property, and the issue of the situation of the three schools after Wu Xun's death, we also conducted some investigations. These three issues are related, so we will discuss them together.

　　We mentioned earlier that Wu Xun's uncle, Cui Lao Hua, who had served as the "chief of the tax office," was a rogue. We also mentioned that Wu Maolin was a rogue, and Wu Maolin was also a close confidant of Wu Xun who was in charge of most of his property in Tangyi.

　　In Tangyi, Wu Xun also had a confidant named Xu Jinzhuan. He was from Zhaolangzhai and died many years ago. We found a copy of Wu Xun's "Land Account" in his descendants' home, proving that he had managed a portion of land for Wu Xun. According to this "Land Account," Wu Xun bought more than fifty-six *mu* of land from December of the seventeenth year of Guangxu to November of the nineteenth year of Guangxu, worth about 1,000 *diao*. This included the land in Zhaolangzhai. But these more than fifty-six *mu* of land were bought by Wu Xun after he opened the Liulin School in the fourteenth year of Guangxu. Not only could this money not have been included in the seven thousand *diao* of Wu Xun's school-establishing donations listed in the "Detailed Report on the Initial Request for Awards" by Tangyi Zhishi Guo Chunxu in June of the fourteenth year of Guangxu (Complete Account of Establishing Schools), but the Wu Xun school-establishing donations listed in the "Detailed Report on the Second Request for Awards" by Tangyi Zhishi Jinlin in September of the twenty-second year of Guangxu (Complete Account of Establishing Schools), after Wu Xun's death (Wu Xun died in April of this year), were still the same amount as Guo Chunxu's in the fourteenth year of Guangxu, without any increase. Therefore, we conclude that the property that Wu Xun increased in Tangyi after the fourteenth year of Guangxu was his private property and was not donated to the school. Xu Jinzhuan was one of the people who managed this part of his private property for Wu Xun. After Wu Xun's death, Xu Jinzhuan's eldest son, Xu Gongjue, was imprisoned by the Yang family on the charge of "resisting the payment of school rent." Based on this, it can be known that the private property that Wu Xun did not hand over during his lifetime, as long as the landlords knew about it, was taken away by the landlords in the name of school land after Wu Xun's death. Wu Maolin may also have had property of this nature in his hands. It is also doubtful whether all the property that Wu Xun accumulated before the fourteenth year of Guangxu was donated to the Liulin School. It is very likely that a part of it was not handed over and was managed by Wu Maolin. Wu Maolin's death may also be related to this, but we have not found any conclusive evidence.

　　What kind of person was Xu Jinzhuan? There is a passage in Jin E'qiu's petition recorded in the "Complete Account of Establishing Schools": "In the villages of Zhaolangzhai, Wang'erda Village, etc., there was an old *Good Book Society* (original as it is, suspected of being wrong - author), and Wu Xun donated more than 200 *diao* of cash. All the zero donations every year were not included. Xu Jinzhuan and others wanted to erect a monument for Wu Xun, but Wu Xun did not allow it. The *Qishe* (village community) was held once a year, and Wu Xun would personally attend the community regardless of any accidents, and would read through the annual printed Good Book records. He would also take several volumes of each Good Book with him and distribute them everywhere." This "Good Book Society" seems to be a secret society organization, and Xu Jinzhuan was the leader. Wu Xun became the big boss of this organization because he spent a lot of money. From this, it can be known that Xu Jinzhuan was also a person who supported Wu Xun's set and helped Wu Xun's work. He was one of Wu Xun's confidants. He was a bit like Wu Maolin, but he was engaged in "Good Books," not "establishing schools."

　　According to our investigation in Guantao, there was also a confidant of Wu Xun there named Wang Xinyuan. This person was a small rich man with ninety *mu* of land. According to the masses, this person liked to gamble and interfere in other people's affairs. Because of gambling, he borrowed Wu Xun's debt for more than ten years and could not repay it. He gave forty *mu* of land and nine houses to Wu Xun to be used as Yang'erzhuang school property. But the land was still farmed by him, and therefore Wang Xinyuan became Wu Xun's agent in the Yang'erzhuang School, serving as one of the heads and stewards of this school. Therefore, Wu Xun was kind to Wang Xinyuan, and their relationship was very close. Another head and steward was the monk Liao Zheng's nephew, a *juren* official, from Yang'erzhuang, named Wang Yuzao. He was Liao Zheng's confidant and later taught in this school for five years. Wang Xinyuan and Wang Yuzao represented the Wu Xun and Liao Zheng factions, and after Wu Xun and Liao Zheng died, they sued each other for school property and became rivals. The opinions of their descendants are also conflicting. On the one hand, Wang Jingdong (49 years old, now a middle peasant), Wang Xinyuan's son, and Wang Yufang (39 years old, middle peasant), Wang Jingdong's nephew, both said that the Yang'erzhuang Free School was established by Wu Xun relying on Wang Xinyuan, and Liao Zheng only contributed some money. On the other hand, Wang Xianzhang (78 years old, used to be a landlord and is now a middle peasant),

　　武训历史调查记（二续）
　　武训历史调查团　  
    （二）武训的为人
    武训出身于一个贫农家庭。他有两个哥哥（武谦、武让），四个姐姐，他排行第七，唤做武七。我们在堂邑武庄武训的曾侄孙武金兴家里查看了武家的神主，知道武训的父亲武宗禹是道光二十五年（一八四五年）死的，母亲崔氏直到同治十二年（一八七三年）才死，那时武训已三十五岁，并非像许多传记以及电影所描写的那样，武训的母亲也是在他年幼时死的。可见劳动人民所说的，武训发迹后不顾家，不顾母亲，倒切合事实。
    当家里生活困难的时候，武训曾跟着他母亲要过饭。虽然那时候他还不是一个职业叫化子，但他从此染上了不关心庄稼活、不爱劳动的游民习气。到他十六、七岁的时候，他母亲设法弄他到馆陶薛店张变征家抗活，就连一些庄稼活的基本常识也没有。崔庄（他母亲的娘家）的王汤传（七十五岁，中农）说：“豆沫不懂庄稼活，连豆子跟棉花都分不清。有一次人家叫他到地里去打棉尖，他把豆尖给招掉了。”
    张变征即张老变，或张老辫，是武训的远房姨夫，是个贡生，有四、五顷地，家里雇了几个人种地。薛店的张晓峰（七十四岁，贫农）说：“武七不算抗活，姨家拿亲戚待承他。他啥活也不会做，出粪铡草都不会。推车子架不准，摇摇晃晃，担水不使手，遛遛跶跶。”因此，张老变只叫他看管“树行子”（果树园），或者做一些喂猪、喂牲口的轻便活。至于他的工钱，薛店的老人说，顶多不过“三鞭”的标准——四吊钱。当时“头鞭”（劳动力最强的雇工）一年的工钱是八、九吊，“二鞭”的工钱是五、六吊。如果照薛店群众的说法，武训仅在张老变家抗活一年，那么工钱顶多四吊；如果照堂邑群众的说法，抗活两年，那么工钱顶多是八吊。张老变是否骗了这笔工钱？群众的说法不一样。有说给了他哥哥，有说给了他自己，有说没有给，其中说给了的较多。薛店的张士珍（五十岁，贫农）说：“武七只抗了一年活，工钱很少，给他哥哥支走了。武七大闹了一场就走了，没有再抗活。”
    经过我们多方调查，除了张老变家之外，再也找不出还有第二家武训曾去抗过活。既没有另一家“张举人”，更没有另一个“李老辫”。武训一生五十九年中，就只有一年（或两年）比较上还算能说是“劳动”过，此外再也没有了。
    武训从张老变那儿回家以后，在决定今后抗活还是要饭的问题上，和他母亲、哥哥起了冲突。武金兴说：“俺老老奶奶和俺老爷爷都叫他抗活去，不愿他当要饭的。”可是武训认为要饭比抗活舒服，所谓“不如讨饭随自己”。他赌咒说：“我出家了，你们别管我！”从此，他就脱离了贫农家庭，背离了劳动人民，“当了大要饭的”（武金兴）。无怪封建统治阶级要表扬他的所谓“亲戚朋友断个净”的态度，因为实际上就是他和劳动人民的关系“断个净”。从那时起，他结交的尽是些流氓、光棍、地主、恶霸、阔和尚和大小官僚。当地群众说他年轻时最欢喜上崔庄找他的舅舅崔老华，那人是个有名的光棍，“他专吃别人”。王汤传说崔老华干过衙门里的“赋房老总”，武训和他最合得来。可以设想，武训从崔老华那儿学到了不少“专吃别人”的本事。后来，武训就在许多县行乞，结识了各县的流氓，竟成了一个有势力的流氓头子。
    武训正式行乞的时候已经是一个将近二十岁的青年。按照社会鄙视不劳而食的习惯，像他那样年轻力壮的人，要饭是不会得到同情的，也不会有多少人给他。因此，为了达到不劳而食的目的，他的第一个方法就是装疯卖傻。八十六岁的张洪鲁（堂邑夫人寨人，中农）说：“豆沫壮着哪！”他还用手比划着说：“脸有这么宽，腰像案板那么粗！”我们问：这样壮实的人要饭，人家为什么肯给呢？张洪鲁说：“他疯迷了呀！”但是另外的人却说：“疯迷了，他对钱财可不糊涂。”这就是说，人们懂得他是装疯，上当的人不多。
    装疯既不能长期骗人，到后来他就想出了一个绝妙的方法，打起“兴义学”的招牌来了。但“义学”决不是他的发明，更不是装神弄怪什么“大梦三天”以后想出来的。“义学”在武训之前便有了。据“临清县志”说：“义学之设，始于清初，由城及乡，逐渐扩充”（第三册第十一页）。这种“义学”，绝大多数是满清王朝办的。从康熙到乾隆年间临清有九个“义学”，其中只有三个是私立（绅士捐建），其余都是“官立”，由知州创办。到了光绪年间，临清“义学”增至二十五处。可见越到后来，满清专制统治者越爱“兴义学”，“义学”在那一带越是发展。在堂邑、馆陶也是如此，在武训常跑的村庄萧集、杨林和千户集，就都在武训之前有了“义学”。武训行乞，到处跑，又接触封建上层分子，便悟出了打起“兴义学”招牌必然对他有利的道理。果然，这块招牌一打，就得到地主阶级的赏识，馆陶县娄塔头的武进士娄峻岭马上看重了他。当地群众说，娄进士谁都不夸奖，却说：“武七能成大事。”
    武训装疯卖傻骗钱的方法是很多的，但是他有一条基本原则，那就是他对地主的态度和对劳动人民的态度不同。他对地主阶级是到处磕头，满口“老爷爷”、“老奶奶”，或“爷爷”、“奶奶”。对地主的子女一律叫“小叔叔”、“小姑姑”。堂邑、馆陶的地主们说武训的“嘴甜着哪！”“脾气好，怎么耍他也不恼。”对劳动人民呢？武训的外孙唐勤习（连二寨人，七十五岁，新中农）说，有一回武训拿了几个杏子到他家，给了唐勤习兄弟们，唐勤习他们以为是舅爷爷送的，就吃了。刚吃完，武训就伸手要钱。张洪鲁说：“就别让豆沫撂下东西，他撂下什么涨什么。他撂在俺家二升红高粱，第二天来拿就要涨。”七十四岁的贫农石东海说：“谁沾着他，谁被害。”“放钱七百算一吊。”
    自从武训正式要饭以后，是否如武训宣传者们所说他干过出粪、铡草、拉砘子、轧棉花、纺线、推磨等项工作呢？据我们调查，除了铡草、推磨之外，其余都没有。而铡草、推磨也不过是在要饭时候所表演的节目，目的是好伸手要钱或要干粮。我们问过几十位老人，只有两人说见过他推磨。其中之一说他推磨带上“驴遮眼”，当许多孩子围着他看的时候，他又学起驴叫来了。连二寨一百零三岁的老人路延林说：“光听他喊推磨，没见他真推过。”当我们向该村的张春华（八十三岁，中农）访问武训当年的劳动情况时，刚一提到铡草，他便说：“铡草铡草，没人来找。”这是劳动人民对武训的评语，应该说是很恰当的。连武训本家的武克科（七十八岁，中农），武玠（七十岁，中农）等人也说：“要饭是正事，干活稀松。”
    武训一边嚷着“兴学”，一边装做疯傻，用尽各种哄骗讹诈的办法，从劳动人民身上搜括血汗。他把第一笔钱（据馆陶的群众说有四、五十吊），交给馆陶武进士娄峻岭替他放债，利息三分。武训明白了放债“涨”得快，就回家闹着要卖地。堂邑县官郭春煦的“义学正碑文”说：“同治初年，将前分业地三亩，变卖得价京钱一百二十千。”事实上，武庄的人们和武金兴都说卖地是真，但并未分家，卖的也不是三亩。武金兴说：“俺家宁死不出地，他一卖就是五亩七。”武训三兄弟共有十二亩地，他的份地是四亩，怎么能卖五亩七呢？据说他所持理由是没有娶妻，但是武金兴说更重要的是怕他凶，只得依他。武训把卖地的钱加上放债所得利息，又经过大恶霸杨树坊等人帮他放债，他的财产就越积越多了。他把整注的找娄峻岭和杨树坊等人替他经营，零碎的自己放。张洪鲁说：“豆沫五百钱也不肯存在身上，隔一天就看涨。”不使他的就下跪，还不起的他就说是“坑”（即赖债的意思）了他的“义学”钱。武训就这样经过高利贷的道路，很快又变成一个地主。有的农民还不起他的高利贷，把土地给了他；有的农民交不起租子，也把土地抵押给他。这样他的土地和高利贷数目便逐渐增加，到最后共达一万七千吊（“临清县志”第十二册第九十页至九十一页）。武训终于如愿以偿，打着“兴学”的招牌，披着乞丐的衣裳，爬进了剥削阶级的行列。
    武训柳林“义塾”的基地是一个小地主郭芬捐的。郭芬为什么肯捐这块地呢？郭芬的本家郭培先（七十三岁，新中农）告诉我们这样一段故事：郭芬不相信武豆沫真办学，有一天碰上豆沫就问：“豆沫，你老喊兴学，为啥几十年不兴？”武训说：“没地盖房子。”郭芬说：“没地好办，东门外有我的地。”武训没得话说，磕了个头就走了。后来杨树坊和武训谈了话，武训不得不答应，这才“刘备招亲，弄假成真”，在杨树坊等人的命令之下，在武训五十一岁的那一年，也就是从他二十一岁打“兴学”招牌起正满三十个年头的那一年，他才和杨树坊合办了柳林镇的“崇贤义塾”。
    自从这个学校办成之后，武训就不仅是流氓的首领，地主家的熟客，又成了官府的上宾。堂邑县官郭春煦请他吃饭，山东巡抚张曜召见了他。武训在郭春煦的宴席上得意地唱道：“摘摘帽，出出火，修义学的就是我。”郭春煦为什么要结识武训呢？柳林“义塾”的学生，现年八十一岁的老秀才倪瞻云对我们说：郭春煦外号郭糊涂，本来因事就要丢官了，忽然发现了武训，赶忙上禀，因此有功，保住了纱帽。
    继柳林“义塾”之后，武训又办了馆陶县杨二庄“义塾”，但武训出钱较少，主要是用的了证和尚的庙产。说到了证和尚，也是一个和武训颇为相像的人物。他同样是穷苦出身，但当了和尚以后，就到北京活动过。回到馆陶，陆续掌管了三个庙的庙产。仅其中西刘庄一个庙，便有土地一百七十亩。除土地外，了证也放了四千余吊钱的高利贷。虽则是一个大地主和大债主，他也和武训一样，实行苦肉计，故意“一条棉裤穿九年”。对自己的穷本家，则是“一升半碗都不借”。据群众说，武训在三十岁左右就拜了证为师，是为了想在钱上打了证的主意，而了证则是利用武训勾结官厅的名望和势力，借兴学以保庙产，他们就这样互相结合起来办了杨二庄“义塾”。
    至于武训在临清的第三所学校，则是在临清的大恶霸兼会门首领施善政的控制之下直到武训临死的那一年才开办的，刚一开办，武训就死了。
    武训宣传者们高兴歌颂武训的“孝行”和“友爱”，这事我们也作了调查。和这种歌颂相反，武训是一个不孝不友的人。为了不务正业，当流氓，武训早和他的家庭闹翻了。为了变卖地产，又曾和他哥哥大闹。七十九岁的郭继武说：“他娘他哥都没沾他的光，他娘死的时候还不是像一条狗一样。”有人说他娘死了他哥叫他回去发丧，他说没有“哭钱”不去，在武训正患财迷病的时候，这可能是事实。群众说，武训把要来的干粮拿去卖给人家喂牲口，却不愿给他的母亲和哥哥吃一口，他就是这样一个无情无义的人。
    李士钊在他的《武训画传》中说：“武训为了发扬高度的阶级友爱”，放过四十石红高粱赈济灾民。我们多方调查，群众都说没有这回事。
    关于武训不娶妻的故事，武训的宣传者也认为是一项重要的“苦行”。据我们调查，武训确没有娶妻，却是拜了许多女人做他的所谓“干娘”。清末的武训宣传者陈代卿，在他的“慎节斋文存”卷上的《武七》一文内说：“武七未没数年前，每见少妇，必叩头乞为义子。或讶而诘之，则曰：吾天罚寒乞，目不识丁，今生已矣，愿来生投善地有福读书耳。”为什么修来生一定要拜干娘，而且一定要拜年轻的干娘呢？这使人们很难理解。但武训用迷信的话头掩盖他拜干娘的行为，去对付那些“讶而诘之”的人们，这是可能的。清末山东提学使罗正钧所编“乞人武训兴学始末记”收录陈代卿此文，改称《武七小传》，却把这一段叙述删去。一九三四年临清武训小学校长国民党人郭金堂所编《武训先生九七诞辰纪念册》，也是这样。这应当是这些武训宣传者们所谓“为贤者讳”的道理，认为这一点如不删去，会显得武训不像个完全的“圣人”。但“未没数年前每见少妇”也不甚确切，据群众说，武豆沫是在他一生中拜了经过他选择的许多年青的或中年的寡妇做干娘。武训自己也公开地唱：“说一百个媒，认一百个干娘，吃一口妈妈，死在路旁”（“吃妈妈”即吃奶）。武训晚年在临清有一位干娘，现年七十多岁，青年守寡，生了个孩子，人们赶着叫“小豆沫”。我们在武庄访问时，见过一位老太太，八十多岁了，他自己也不隐讳她和武训的关系，说豆沫吃过她的“妈妈”。在场的武金兴的妻子听了生气地说：“你干么说这个！”这位老太太说：“干么不能说，人家（指武训）不是凡人！”在她的心目中，武训不但成了名，而且成了神，她感觉她和武训有这类关系是光荣的。但此人却非武训的“干娘”，而是他的族弟妇，年轻时就守寡。
    四十二岁以后大发起来的武训，确实还是披着一件叫化子衣服，往来于堂邑、临清、馆陶、冠县一带地方，但已经不是乞丐，而是一个大债主和大地主了。杨树坊的孙子七十岁的杨光汉（地主）说：“武训晚年的工作主要是催租、讨息、检查学校，拿着各县绅士们替他立的缘簿到处募捐，并推销《太上感应篇》、《阴骘文》、《灶王经》、《劝世文》等《善书》。
    孙瑜和李士钊，都说武训反对立牌坊。据我们调查，确实没有牌坊，只有一块“乐善好施”的匾额，我们拍了照片。孙瑜和李士钊的根据，大概是因为郭春煦在其“初次请奖详文”（兴学始末记，即罗正钧所编书，下同）里说过：“此案例奖，本可建坊。惟该乡民并不好名，即蒙奏准，断不为此，则是旷典仍同虚设。将来拟由卑职遵照奖案，改给匾额，悬挂义学，合并声明。”我们认为这一“声明”是有原因的，郭春煦不过用自己的嘴代替杨树坊说了话，不愿意武训建坊的是杨树坊。因为在当时社会上，建坊影响极大，且必建于武庄而与柳林“义学”分开，这对杨树坊很不利。匾则影响较小，且可“悬挂义学”，对杨树坊较有利。后来张曜不听郭春煦的话，还是奏请清帝“俯准堂邑县民武七自行建坊，给予乐善好施字样”，并已获准。但这和杨树坊的利益冲突，到底不能实行，还是挂匾而不建坊。为什么建坊就算“好名”，挂匾则不算“好名”呢？这是说不通的，因此孙瑜和李士钊率性把这段挂匾的故事也隐讳起来，说成武训反对建坊，反对接受清帝的荣典。但当地群众却说，武训曾着人抬着这块匾在柳林镇上游街数日。武训死后，武家和杨家不断斗争，武家竟至被杨家迫死两条人命。这两条人命，一条是武训的助手武茂林（此人上了孙瑜的电影），一条是武训的过继来的孙子武鲁林。到后来，武家才从柳林学校将这块“乐善好施”匾额打黑夜里抢回去，挂在武庄的武家。我们是从武金兴家里看见这块匾，并从武金兴和柳林、武庄的群众口里听到武杨两家长期残酷斗争中杨胜武败的经过以及黑夜抢匾的“最后优胜”故事。
    就在武训生前，武训这个流氓大地主和他的合作者那些有功名的大地主朋友们之间，也不是没有矛盾的。我们看出，他们之间曾经有过很大的矛盾。他们之间，互相利用。一到利害冲突，武训斗他们不过，总是迁就妥协，但是心里不甘。据群众说，武训很想在死后替他自己修个祠堂，但杨树坊不肯。武训的忠实助手武茂林，看了过意不去，他又有心在武训死后承继武训的行乞兴学事业，他就向武训说：你死之后我一定要替你修个祠堂。武训立即从炕上跳下来给武茂林磕了一个头，表示感激和拜托。这是武训临死以前不久的事情。因为武茂林经管过武训的财产，柳林学校立起以后他也还能代表武训和杨家所派人员共同经管学校的财产，此外，武训很可能还有一部分未交给学校的私产，例如某些房产和某些放债是由他管理着，所以武训一死，武茂林就不顾杨树坊的反对，修起祠堂来了。群众说，当时杨树坊反对很坚决，说“钱是义学的，不能修祠堂”，并且不许武茂林过问武训的财产和学校。但是武茂林还是要修。没有钱就向商人赊购材料，动起工来，祠堂居然修成了。那边杨树坊坚决不认账，声言武茂林和“义学”无关。这样一来，赊卖材料的和包工的人们发慌了，大伙儿向武茂林要钱。杨树坊又威胁武茂林，说商人们要向县里告他了。武茂林这才知道自己走进了绝路，一索子吊死在武训祠堂的门口。群众认为武茂林也是个流氓，但对他死得可怜这一点，却表示很大的同情。他们异口同声地说：武茂林是“活活被杨家逼死的”。只有在一九一三年任过武训学校董事的穆仲山（柳林镇人，六十六岁，过去是地主，现在是中农），提出了不同的意见。他说：流氓武茂林，和武训没有任何关系，连跑腿工作也没有做过，死是他自己要死的，并没人逼迫他。我们认为这种说法显然歪曲了事实。穆仲山又说，武茂林死前做了两块神主，放在祠堂里，一块写的是武训，一块写的是武茂林自己，然后才上吊。我们认为这点可能是事实，因为武茂林是以武训的继承人自居的，武训生前也可能以此托付他。武训虽然和杨树坊合作，但有很大的矛盾，武训认为只有武茂林这一类人才是最可靠的人。
    武茂林是武训的远房侄孙，一生帮助武训干所谓行乞兴学，结果被杨树坊逼死。武鲁林是武谦的孙子，武克信的儿子，在武训晚年过继武训为孙，被杨家控以“抗不交学租”，县官捉去拷打重伤，放出来，第二天就死了。我们在前面说过武训不顾家，这是他少年和中年的事。到他老年，大约是对杨树坊控制过严不满，同时社会舆论也对他不满，还是请求杨家允许拨出了四十余亩地以作武家祭田的名义交给武鲁林的父亲武克信耕种，同时以每年交租钱十串给学校的条件满足了杨家。此事曾在官厅立了案（见兴学始末记，说是四十亩，武金兴告诉我们是四十余亩）。但杨家后来硬夺回去，否认祭田，肯定是学田，派武鲁林送重租，武鲁林出不起，发生争讼，因此人被活活打死，地被夺去。这就是武家“两条人命”的公案。群众对于此事一概同情武家。当武金兴向我们说到这些事的时候，我们和他都感觉难过。武金兴沉痛地说：“我们和杨家有仇！”
    关于武训的流氓帮口问题，武训是否有私产问题和武训死后三所学校的情况问题，我们也作了一些调查。这三个问题有连带性，我们就将这些说在一起。
    我们在前面已经提到了当过“赋房老总”的武训舅父崔老华是个流氓。我们又提到武茂林是个流氓，武茂林并且是武训用做在堂邑方面替他经管大部分财产的一个贴身亲信人物。
    在堂邑方面，武训还有一个亲信人物，名叫许谨传。他是赵郎寨人，死了多年了。我们在他后代的家里找到一本武训的“地亩账”抄本，证明他曾替武训管理过一部分土地。根据这篇“地亩账”所载，光绪十七年十二月至光绪十九年十一月武训买地五十六亩多，约值一千吊左右，这里边就有赵郎寨的地。但这五十六亩多的地是武训在光绪十四年开办柳林学校以后买的，不但在光绪十四年六月堂邑知事郭春煦的“初次请奖详文”（兴学始末记）所列武训兴学捐款七千余串之内不可能有这一笔，就是光绪二十二年九月武训死后（武训是这年四月死的）堂邑知事金林的“二次请奖详文”（兴学始末记）所列武训兴学捐款，还是光绪十四年郭春煦的同一个数目，并未增加一文。因此我们断定，光绪十四年以后武训在堂邑方面所增加的财产是他的私产，并未捐入学校。许谨传就是替武训管理这部分私产的一个人。在武训死后，许谨传的长子许功珏，曾被杨家以“抗不交学租”的罪名关进牢里过。根据这一点，就可知道武训生前没有交出的私产，凡是被地主们知道了的，在武训死后都被地主们以学田名义夺去了。武茂林手中也很可能有这种性质的财产。武训在光绪十四年以前所积的财产是否全部捐给柳林学校，也是可疑的，很可能有一部分未交出而由武茂林管着，武茂林之死可能也和这点有关，不过我们未找到确实证据。
    许谨传究竟是个什么样的人物呢？“兴学始末记”所载靳鹗秋的呈文里有一段说：“赵郎寨、王二大寨等村，旧有善书会一道（原文如此，疑有误——笔者），武训捐助京钱二百余吊，每年所有零捐不在其内。许谨传等欲为武训立碑，武训不许。每年齐社一次，武训不论有何事故，必亲身到社，并遍阅每年所印善书簿记。又自取各善书若干卷随身携带，到处施放”。这个“善书会一道”看来像是个会门组织，许谨传是个头儿。武训则因出了许多钱，成了这组织的大头儿。由此可知，许谨传也是一个拥护武训那一套，并帮助武训工作的人，是武训的亲信人物之一。他很有些像武茂林，不过他干的是“善书”，不是“兴学”罢了。
    根据我们在馆陶的调查，那里也有一个武训的亲信人物，名叫汪信远。此人是个有九十来亩地的小财主，杨二庄人。据群众说，此人好赌，爱管闲事。因为赌的原故，他借了武训十几年的债，还不起，将四十亩地和九间房子折给了武训，充为杨二庄学产，但地还是归他种，并且因此汪信远就成了武训在杨二庄学校的代理人，做了这个学校的首事和管事员之一。因此武训于汪信远有恩，他们的关系很密切。另一个首事和管事员是了证和尚的外甥，举人老爷，杨二庄人，名叫汪毓藻。他是了证的亲信，后来在这学校教过五年书。汪信远和汪毓藻代表武训和了证两派，武训和了证死后，他们二人为争学产打官司，成了对头。两人子孙的意见也是冲突的。一方面汪信远的儿子汪景东（四十九岁，现在是中农）和汪景东的侄儿汪毓芳（三十九岁，中农）都说，杨二庄义学是武训依靠汪信远办的，了证只出了一些钱。另方面汪毓藻的儿子汪宪章（七十八岁，过去是地主，现在是中农）则说，义学是了证办的，武训只出了“十吊钱”。我们又在杨二庄义学里看见两块碑，同是光绪十五年所立，同是馆陶县知事彭元熙写的。一块完全吹嘘了证，根本不提武训。另一块则以吹嘘了证为主，附带替武训吹了几句。这种怪事，当然只能以地主和流氓的矛盾来解释。
    在临清方面，也有一个帮助武训管财产的亲信人物，叫于殿元，也是个流氓。于殿元在光绪二十二年武训刚死几个月后向临清州官控诉靳鹗秋的禀状上说：武训“有心在临清另创义学一所，伊一人因独力难办，伊知身（于殿元自称——笔者）自幼专心善事，命我与伊帮办。有赵一琴主盟，与身结拜生死之交。……讵武训于光绪二十二年四月间染病，身日夜侍奉，至将死之时，命身当面立誓，以后如不诚心接办，天诛地灭。讵有恶衿靳鹗秋……将义学霸持，诓去缘簿不给，复不准接办”（兴学始末记）。临清州绅士张?等则代替靳鹗秋反诉于殿元：“武训创修义学，于殿元巧与结盟，不过与武训作伴，义学中并无伊之姓名。且于殿元之素行邪正，职等概不得知，但伊在夏津因盗案被押，武训当堂保释。嗣后在义学看门谋食，此外毫无操劳。伊于缘簿内竟托使京钱三十余吊，职等知伊从中取利，因此将伊逐出不用”（同上书）。于殿元，鲁西夏津人，打上述那个官司的时候他是五十三岁（同上书）。于殿元诉状中所说的赵一琴，是当时临清的有声望的大绅士，是个举人。武训和于殿元“结拜生死之交”，要赵一琴主盟，赵一琴也肯出面为他们主盟，我们判断是和争夺临清学校管理权一事有关的。武训愿意赵一琴一派辅导于殿元在他死后接管这个学校，而不愿意靳鹗秋一派管这个学校。故靳鹗秋方面的人也不能否认武于结盟赵为主盟一事，而只能说“巧与结盟”。
    上述诸武训亲信流氓人物，除崔老华做“赋房老总”，许谨传为武训经管《善书》，未干“兴学”这把戏之外，武训、武茂林、汪信远、于殿元，都是干“兴学”的一型人物。武训一死，武茂林、汪信远、于殿元都受到地主阶级的打击，武茂林被迫自杀，汪信远被排斥，于殿元被逐出学校。他们和阿Ｑ不同，不是“不许革命”，而是不许“兴学”，因为地主阶级不要这类人物了。
    因此我们断定，武训生前，在鲁西一带，有一个相当大的流氓帮口，而武训、武茂林、许谨传、汪信远、于殿元及其他我们尚未查出的人们，则是这个帮口的核心人物。武训的社会基础是流氓帮口，以此去与地主和官僚合作，加上特殊的“兴学”关系，地主就临时地利用他，官僚则想利用得更广更久些。这一点，我们从武训死后各处“义学”皆先后因争学产停办，后经官府扶持才又继续办下去这一事实，获得了证明。
    武训和他的合作者大地主们之间的矛盾，在武训生前就有了，只是没有爆发。其原因之一，是武训有省城官僚的支持。州县官是听大地主的话的，但也不得不顾及省城官僚的意旨，因此武训还吃得开，还能和大地主杨树坊等共同管理校产。武训一死，三所学校都发生对财产的争讼。地主们把武训的亲信一脚踢开，不要他们。接着是几派地主互相争斗，闹得乌烟瘴气。在堂邑方面，是巡抚出来调停，挂上“武训初级小学堂”的牌子，名义上不算杨家学堂了（兴学始末记载武训疏族“陆军司务长”“五品顶戴”武昌达，在宣统元年控告杨家说：“前数年与今年之学生，俱系姓杨者，与杨名远在四服之内，郭、穆、常、柳、韩、赵等姓一个无有”），管理权也从杨家分出一份给另一派地主，称为“帮理”，敷衍一时。在临清方面，学校本来是武训和临清关包税商人施善政合作办起的。武训死后，施善政也因贪赃被抄没，学校就被另一派大地主夺去，并且说钱都是他们出的，武训并没有什么大功劳。以上堂邑临清两方面的斗争，大部分可从“兴学始末记”所载流氓和地主、地主和地主间的控诉、反诉及官厅往来文件中找到根据，一部分是我们从群众中查得的。馆陶方面，则是汪信远和汪毓藻为争校产打官司，结果是学校由官办，校产归公。这方面的材料，是我们从馆陶群众中查得的。我们从武训生前和死后这三所学校的情况看出，不管地主也好，武训这批流氓也好，主要地都不是什么真正为了兴学，而是为了争这笔财产的管理权。
    根据上述各种材料，使我们了解武训是一个在鲁西许多县里的流氓群中有势力的流氓头子，他与鲁西数县的地主特别是大绅士大恶霸相勾结，与县城府城省城的大小官员相勾结，使自己成为大债主、大地主和大名人。武训就是这样一个在流氓、地主、官僚三种集团中极为活跃，因而脱离一切劳动人民，并和人民处于对立地位的特殊人物。武训及其流氓兄弟们和地主阶级有矛盾，但在他生前这种矛盾还没有表面化，主要靠了官僚尤其省城官僚方面的维持。武训一死，他的学校先后瓦解，财产被地主霸占侵蚀，他的亲信都被打击。当地群众对于武训是嫌恶的，但对于受打击最惨的他的代理人，例如武茂林，则是寄与同情的。武训的始终不变的形象是行乞，武训和一切普通乞丐或流氓不同的特点是兴学。而这两点（行乞和兴学）互相结合在一起，就为一切时期的反动统治者所喜爱，而为之尽力宣扬。某些思想错误的人们也喜爱这样一个人物，而为之尽力宣扬。这样，就迷惑了许多天真的头脑简单的人们。因此，揭露武训和武训宣传者的真相，就成了必要的工作。
    在武训死后，在鲁西及别地出现了一批吃武训饭的人。其中的一人是临清的号称“武训第二”的王丕显，是一个借兴学发财的学棍，这里不来详说。另一人是堂邑的武金栋。武金栋，堂邑武庄人，是武训的疏族，现年七十八岁，他就是现存的一个活武训。他在武训死后一意学武训，见有钱人就磕头，低眉顺眼，出口成词，到处募捐，很积了一笔钱。他在抗日战争爆发前到过南京，为国民党所赏识，捧为活宝。他和我们见面，还是口中念念有词。他对群众的态度很坏，当地群众很不满意他，在土地改革时把他当作了斗争的对象。我们找他谈话，柳林镇的群众很感诧异。他从街上走过的时候，群众指着说：“为啥这家伙又来了！”
