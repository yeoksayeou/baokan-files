　　Comrade Liu Baiyu, Stalin Prize Winner, Donates Entire Prize Money to the People's Liberation Army
　　Liu Baiyu, a Chinese film worker who participated in the production of the film "The Victory of the Chinese People" and won the Stalin Prize for Literature and Art, donated all the prize money awarded to him on the 13th of this month by the Soviet Ambassador to China on behalf of the Stalin Prize Committee to the Chinese People's Liberation Army for cultural construction expenses of the troops. He also sent a letter to the General Political Department of the Central People's Government's Revolutionary Military Commission, which reads in part: "Due to my participation in the production of the film 'The Victory of the Chinese People,' I am honored to have received the Stalin Prize for Literature and Art awarded by the Soviet Union. This is not my personal honor; it is the result of the arduous struggle and heroic combat of our People's Liberation Army, which achieved the great victory of the Chinese people. Our excellent cadres and soldiers not only enriched this film with their bloodshed, sacrifice, and heroic and unparalleled actual struggles, but also directly participated in and assisted in organizing various filming tasks. Now this film has received its due glory, and this glory should belong to every comrade who participated in the work, especially our comrades in the troops. Our Liberation Army is not only a heroic and well-fighting army but also an army with culture. We are willing to strive to create higher cultural and artistic achievements in the future. Now I offer all the prize money I have received, 18,555,700 yuan, hoping it will be used as part of the cultural construction expenses of the troops."

　　The North China Region University Graduates Summer Study Group, which opened in Beijing on the 6th of this month, concluded on the 13th after eight days of study. During the study process, students listened to reports from the heads of relevant departments of the Central People's Government on various construction tasks, learned about the country's construction situation in various aspects, and understood the relationship between the country and individuals, which improved their thinking. Therefore, at the end of the study, they unanimously expressed their determination to obey the government's assignment.
　　At the closing meeting of the summer study group held on the 13th, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De attended and spoke. Commander-in-Chief Zhu De pointed out that university graduates have a great responsibility and called on students to serve the people wholeheartedly. He hoped that the students would make the greatest determination to go to work wherever it is difficult and overcome any difficulties in their work. An Ziwen, Minister of Personnel of the Central People's Government, explained the significance of the unified allocation of university graduates and the principles of unified allocation, requiring students to obey the unified allocation of the government, firmly resolve to serve the people, and become cadres with both ability and integrity, becoming loyal servants of the people. He hoped that the students would have a honest working attitude, be humble and prudent, and unite and love each other. Minister An Ziwen also pointed out that there are still many shortcomings in our various tasks today, but these shortcomings can be overcome. When everyone encounters shortcomings in their work at their work posts, they should not be pessimistic and disappointed, but should work hard in a down-to-earth manner and help improve the shortcomings in the work. Representatives of graduates from Peiyang University, Yenching University, Tsinghua University, and Hebei Institute of Technology also spoke at the meeting. They unanimously expressed their determination to obey the unified allocation of the government. (Xinhua News Agency)
