Party organizations should always pay attention to correcting the masses' various erroneous understandings of the Korean situation

Editor's note: The Second District Committee of the Communist Party of China in Dongguang County, Shandong Province, closely monitors the ideological trends of the masses and conducts timely political education to correct their erroneous understandings of the Korean situation. Party organizations in rural areas should pay attention to this issue, pay attention to the ideological situation of the masses at all times, and educate them.

After hearing the news of the Korean armistice negotiations, farmers in Datun Village, Second District, Dongguang County, Shandong Province, experienced two types of reactions. One group developed complacency, thinking that "now there is no need to resist America and aid Korea." The other group failed to recognize that the possibility of a ceasefire arose only after the US imperialist invading forces suffered severe blows. After learning about this situation, the Party District Committee immediately convened a forum for farmers. First, Party workers explained the situation of the Korean War, pointing out that the reason why US imperialism accepted the proposal for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue was due to the severe blows of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies and the coercion of the powerful forces of people around the world striving for peace. After the forum, the masses' thinking greatly improved. Farmer Jin Fusheng said: "US imperialism's acceptance of the armistice negotiation proposal is the result of the great victory of the Chinese and Korean People's forces, but we cannot be complacent." Chen Wansheng said: "We must not be complacent and be fooled; don't let US imperialism use delaying tactics to attack us." The masses who attended the meeting raised their vigilance. They said: If US imperialism wants to continue its aggression, we also have the strength to defeat it. The meeting also decided to do the following: (1) Continue to carry out the patriotic campaign of increasing production and making donations. (2) Do a good job of farming on behalf of the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel, so that their production and life have no difficulties. (3) Mobilize young and middle-aged people to join the main forces and militia, consolidate national defense, and strengthen local public security. (4) Universally review and revise patriotic covenants, and ensure that every covenant is fulfilled.

　　党组织要随时注意纠正群众
    对朝鲜形势的各种错误认识
    编者按：中共山东省东光县二区区委，密切注视群众的思想动态，并对群众及时进行政治教育，纠正他们对朝鲜形势的错误认识。各地农村党的组织应重视这个问题，随时注意群众的思想情况，向他们进行教育。
    山东省东光县二区大屯村农民听到朝鲜停战谈判消息后，一种人是产生了麻痹思想，认为“现在可以不必抗美援朝了”；另一种人是认不清美帝国主义侵略军遭受严重打击后，才有停战的可能。党的区委会了解这一情况后，即召集农民开座谈会，首先由党的工作者讲解了朝鲜战争形势，指出美帝国主义所以接受和平解决朝鲜问题的建议，是在中朝人民军队的严重打击及全世界人民争取和平的强大力量胁迫下才有可能的道理。经过座谈后，群众思想大大提高了一步。农民靳福胜说：“美帝国主义接受停战谈判的建议，是中朝人民部队打了大胜仗的结果，可是我们不能麻痹”。陈万胜说：“可不能麻痹上当，别叫美帝国主义用缓兵计来袭击我们。”参加会的群众都提高了警惕，他们说：美帝国主义要继续侵略，我们也有力量打垮它。会上并决定做好以下几件事：（１）继续开展爱国增产捐献运动。（２）作好烈属、军属的代耕，使他们的生产、生活没有困难。（３）动员青壮年参加主力军及民兵，巩固国防，加强地方治安。（４）要普遍地检查修订爱国公约，每条公约都要做到。
