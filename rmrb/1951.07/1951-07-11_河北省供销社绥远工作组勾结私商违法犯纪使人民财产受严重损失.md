    Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative Suiyuan Work Group Colluded with Private Merchants in Illegal Activities, Causing Serious Losses to People's Property
To the Editor:

    I am a member of the New Democratic Youth League, and I am deeply saddened by the actions of the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative Suiyuan Work Group in colluding with private merchants, seriously violating national policies and laws, and damaging the interests of the people. Now I am reporting these matters to you, hoping that you will publish them to attract the attention of economic work departments in various regions, and I hope that the Supreme People's Procuratorate will investigate and deal with them, and publish the results of the handling in the newspaper.

    The serious errors of this work group are as follows:

    (1) Private merchant has long owed the cooperative over 750,000 jin of grain, causing great losses to the people's property. From October 1949 to July 1950, the Suiyuan Work Group of the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative resided in a private grain and goods store in Guisui. The store manager, Xing Zongzhou, was a fellow villager and friend of Zhou Ying, the person in charge of the work group. Because of this relationship, the cooperative work group signed a contract with Xing Zongzhou, giving him a large quantity of cloth to exchange for grain for the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative. But by the time the accounts were settled in May 1950, Xing Zongzhou owed the cooperative over 750,000 jin of grain, deliberately delaying repayment until June of this year, when he finally paid it off. The long-term delay in repaying these grains has seriously affected the turnover of the cooperative's funds, and the grain was repaid through various improper means and at excessively low grain prices. Because Xing Zongzhou could not repay the grain, the cooperative signed another contract with Xing in September 1950, giving him a large amount of cloth and cash to do business with, so that he could earn money to repay the cooperative's grain debts. In the meantime, Xing Zongzhou sold a large amount of grain to the cooperative, and converted the cash into grain prices to repay hundreds of thousands of jin of grain owed to the cooperative; however, when the cooperative purchased Xing's grain, the price was higher than the market price, and when Xing used cash to repay the cooperative's grain debt, the price was lower than the market price, resulting in losses to the cooperative of no less than hundreds of thousands of jin of millet. For example, the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative purchased 1.08 million jin of red sorghum from Xing Zongzhou in Sa County for 430 yuan per jin, while the local grain company's red sorghum price was 346 yuan per jin, with the cooperative paying 84 yuan more per jin of grain. Another example is in March of this year, when Xing Zongzhou converted cash into 150,000 jin of wheat to repay the Hebei Provincial Cooperative, the price of wheat was 600 yuan per jin, but the market and grain company price was 900 yuan per jin at the time, and the cooperative received 300 yuan less per jin of wheat. Similar things have happened five or six times.

    (2) Sheltering private merchant Xing Zongzhou in smuggling and tax evasion. When the cooperative gave Xing Zongzhou money and cloth to do business, fearing that the business would not make money and he would not be able to repay the grain owed to the cooperative, it also issued a certificate in the name of the cooperative, allowing Xing Zongzhou to do business in various places without paying taxes at all. This allowed Xing Zongzhou to conceal the sales of 1.5 million jin of grain and 17,000 bolts of native cloth without paying taxes. This spring, the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative used more than 200 million yuan to have Xing Zongzhou buy cowhide in Suiyuan and sell it in Beijing. The earned money was to let Xing Zongzhou pay off the debts. At this time, the government had banned private trafficking in cowhide, but the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative did not hesitate to violate the law to do so.

    (3) Cadre style issues: Some cadres of the Suiyuan Work Group of the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, under the leadership of Zhou Ying and others, have a very improper style, often mingling with private merchants for banquets and meals, which they call "mingling with private merchants to facilitate business"; some people even accept gifts such as leather shoes and watches from private merchants.

    The above-mentioned matters that I have written have factual evidence to be verified. I have also raised these issues to the leaders of the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Suiyuan Work Group orally or in writing, but they have not paid attention to them or dealt with them. I think their approach is even more incorrect, and I hope they will conduct a thorough self-criticism on this matter.
                Reader Wang Zhenjiu

    Editor's note: Certain cadres of the Suiyuan Work Group of the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative colluded with private merchants, violated policies, and seriously damaged the interests of cooperative members and the country. This demonstrates the serious misconduct of these cooperative cadres. Why has the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative still not dealt with these situations after learning about them? We hope that relevant departments will help the Hebei Provincial Cooperative thoroughly investigate and deal with this matter.

### 河北省供销社绥远工作组勾结私商违法犯纪使人民财产受严重损失

    河北省供销社绥远工作组勾结私商违法犯纪使人民财产受严重损失编辑同志：
    我是一个新民主主义青年团员，我对河北省供销合作总社绥远工作组勾结私商、严重违犯国家政策法令及损害人民利益的行为十分痛心。现在我把这些事报告给你们，请予刊登，以引起各地经济工作部门的注意，并希望最高人民检察署调查处理，且将处理结果在报上公布。
    该工作组的严重错误有这样几宗：
    （一）私商曾长期拖欠合作社七十五万余斤粮食，使人民财产受到很大损失。河北省供销合作总社绥远工作组，从一九四九年十月到一九五○年七月，是住在归绥一个私营粮货栈里。货栈经理邢宗洲，和工作组负责人周英是同乡和朋友。由于这种关系，合作社工作组便和邢宗洲订立合同，交给邢大批布匹，由他给河北省供销合作总社换粮食。但到一九五○年五月结账，邢宗洲已欠下合作社粮食七十五万余斤，故意拖延不还，直到今年六月才还清。长期拖欠这些粮食，已严重影响了合作社资金的周转，而还粮又是通过各种不正当的办法和按过低的粮价折款偿还的。因为邢宗洲还不了粮，合作社又在一九五○年九月和邢订合同，给他大批布和现款，让他拿去作生意，赚了钱再还合作社的粮账。在这中间，邢宗洲曾以大批粮食倒卖给合作社，并以现款折成粮价，偿还所欠合作社的数十万斤粮食；但在合作社收买邢的粮食时，则所定粮价高于市价，而当邢用现款向合作社还粮食账时，则所定粮价又低于市价，合作社因此所受的损失不下数十万斤小米。如河北省供销合作总社在萨县收买邢宗洲的一百零八万斤红粮，每斤价四百三十元，而当时当地粮食公司红粮牌价为每斤三百四十六元，每斤粮食合作社多出了八十四元。又如今年三月份邢宗洲用现款折成小麦十五万斤，还了河北省社，小麦每斤作价六百元，但当时市场及粮食公司牌价为每斤九百元，合作社每斤麦少得三百元。类似这样的事情还有五、六次之多。
    （二）包庇私商邢宗洲走私漏税。当合作社把款和布交给邢宗洲作买卖时，怕买卖不能赚钱，还不了所欠合作社的粮食，于是又以合作社的名义开证明文件，让邢宗洲到各地作买卖，完全不纳税。这样使邢宗洲瞒了一百五十万斤粮食及一万七千匹土布的销货未上税。今年春天，又由河北省供销合作总社用两亿多元，由邢宗洲在绥远买牛皮到北京去卖。赚了钱让邢宗洲还账。这时政府已禁止私人贩运牛皮，河北省供销合作总社竟不惜违法这样作。
    （三）干部作风问题：河北省供销合作总社绥远工作组的某些干部在周英等领导之下，作风很不正派，经常与私商混在一起请客吃饭，他们称此为“和私商打成一片，好搞业务”；有的人并接受私商送给的皮鞋、手表等礼物。
    我所写的以上这些事情，都有实据可查。对这些问题，我也曾向河北省供销合作总社及绥远工作组的领导上口头或书面提出过，但他们都不予重视，不予处理，我认为他们这种作法更是不对的，希望他们对此进行深刻检讨。
                读者  王振九      
    编者按：河北省供销合作总社绥远工作组某些干部，勾结私商，违犯政策，严重损害了社员群众及国家的利益。这表现了这些合作社干部的严重不良作风，而河北省供销合作总社为何在知道这些情形以后仍不加处理？希有关部门帮助河北省合作总社对此事彻底查纠处理。
