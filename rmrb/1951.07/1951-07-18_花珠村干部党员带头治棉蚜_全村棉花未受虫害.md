　　Village Cadres and Party Members in Huazhu Village Take the Lead in Treating Cotton Aphids; Cotton in the Entire Village is Free from Insect Pests

　　The cadres and Communist Party members of Huazhu Village in Zanhuang County, Hebei Province, actively led the peasants in eliminating cotton aphids, so that the cotton in the entire village was free from insect pests.

　　On June 10th, the village cadres generally inspected the cotton fields in the entire village and found that cotton aphids were very serious. Of the more than 900 mu of cotton in the village, one-third had cotton aphids. Li Yichang's one mu of cotton was completely withered by cotton aphids. Even in the least affected fields, 15% of the cotton seedlings were damaged. The secretary of the village's CCP branch immediately reported the situation of the cotton aphids to the district. On the one hand, the village cadres mobilized mutual aid groups and bought three sprayers. According to the instructions from the district, all the village cadres, party members, militiamen, propagandists, and members of the production technology group first learned how to treat cotton aphids, and then mobilized households one by one, calling on cotton farmers to take emergency prevention and control measures to ensure that the cotton would not be harmed. Cotton farmer group meetings were also held to explain the methods of treating aphids to everyone. The cooperative prepared a large number of aphid control agents to supply the masses. After nine days of hard work, the affected cotton has been treated once in general, and some have been treated twice. Now the cotton aphids in the village's cotton fields have been eliminated, and the green cotton seedlings have grown to more than a foot tall.

　　花珠村干部党员带头治棉蚜
    全村棉花未受虫害
    河北省赞皇县花珠村的干部和共产党员，积极领导农民除治棉蚜，使全村的棉花未受虫害。
    在六月十日，该村干部普遍查看了全村的棉花地，发现棉蚜虫很严重。全村九百多亩棉花，有三分之一生了棉蚜，李义昌的一亩棉花全部被棉蚜害枯了。最轻的也有百分之十五的棉苗被害。该村中共支部书记立即向区上报告了棉蚜的情况，一面由村干部动员互助组，买了三架喷雾器。全村干部、党员、民兵、宣传员及生产技术组组员，根据区上的指示，自己先学会治棉蚜办法，然后挨户动员，号召棉农紧急防治，决不让棉花受害。还分别召开棉农小组会，向大家讲解治蚜虫的办法。合作社配制了大批治蚜药剂，供应群众。经过九天的努力后，被害的棉花已普遍治了一遍，有的治了两遍。现在该村棉田中的棉蚜已被消灭，绿油油的棉苗已经长到一尺多高了。
