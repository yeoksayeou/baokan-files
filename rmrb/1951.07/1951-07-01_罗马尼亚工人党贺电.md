　　To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China:

　　On the occasion of the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the heroic Communist Party of China, the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party extends warm congratulations to you. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, headed by its beloved leader Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have experienced a glorious path of revolutionary struggle, and have won their liberation from the shackles of American and Japanese imperialism and the domestic feudal reactionary rule.

　　The victory of the Chinese working class and the entire Chinese people is a great example, filling the colonial and oppressed people of Asia with confidence and hope in their struggle to break away from imperialist enslavement and strive for national liberation.

　　Our people are watching the historical victory of the Chinese people with warm sympathy. We wish the Communist Party of China new victories in its historically significant struggle to build a strong and happy China, and in the struggle against the American imperialist bandit gang's plan to dominate the world. Every victory of the Chinese people is a victory for the invincible camp of peace headed by the great Soviet Union and its standard-bearer, the great Comrade Stalin.

                        Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party
                            General Secretary Groza

    欣逢英勇的中国共产党建党三十周年之际，罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会特向您们致以热烈的祝贺。中国人民在以其敬爱的领袖毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党领导之下，经历了光荣的革命斗争的道路，从美国及日本帝国主义的羁绊下和国内封建反动统治下，获得了自己的解放。
    中国工人阶级及全中国人民的胜利，是一个伟大的榜样，它使亚洲各殖民地及被压迫的人民在其摆脱帝国主义的奴役争取民族解放的斗争中，充满了信心与希望。
    我国人民正满怀热烈的同情，注视着中国人民的历史性的胜利。谨祝中国共产党在其为建立强大而幸福的中国的具有历史意义的斗争中，在反对美帝国主义匪帮称霸世界的计划的斗争中，获得新的胜利。中国人民的每一个胜利就是以伟大苏联及其旗手伟大斯大林同志为首的不可战胜的和平阵营的胜利。
