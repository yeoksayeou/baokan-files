    [Xinhua News Agency, July 7] Li Dequan, head of the Chinese delegation to the Executive Committee of the International Democratic Women's Federation, and members Bai Lang and Qi Yun returned to Beijing on the afternoon of the 7th. The chairman and heads of various departments of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation welcomed them at the airport.

    The Executive Committee of the International Democratic Women's Federation was held in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, in late June. The meeting heard a report from Mrs. Rosette, head of the International Democratic Women's Federation's investigation team on the atrocities of American troops invading Korea, and resolved to urge all member organizations of the International Democratic Women's Federation, women's organizations that have not joined the International Women's Federation, and all people's organizations that support peace to cooperate in launching a broad protest movement against the atrocities of the American aggressor troops in Korea. The meeting heard a report from Mrs. Gordon, chairman of the International Democratic Women's Federation, on the tasks of women in the struggle for peace, and resolved to more deeply and broadly mobilize the people to actively participate in the signature campaign to support the conclusion of a peace pact and to participate in the peace movement with practical actions. The meeting focused on discussing the convening of the International Conference for the Defense of Children in September and related preparations for the conference. In addition, the meeting passed a resolution supporting Mrs. Felton, the British representative of the investigation team on the atrocities of American troops invading Korea, who was persecuted by the British government.
