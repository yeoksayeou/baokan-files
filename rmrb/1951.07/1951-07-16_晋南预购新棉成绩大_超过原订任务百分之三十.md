The state-owned trading companies and cooperatives in the cotton-producing areas of southern Shanxi Province pre-purchased more than 7,015,000 jin of new cotton from cotton farmers with grain and means of production before and after planting, exceeding the original target by 30 percent. Through the pre-purchase of new cotton, cotton farmers generally recognized the importance of growing more cotton to support national industry. As a result, the cotton planting area in the region has generally expanded this year. According to statistics from 17 counties in the Linfen area alone, the area originally planned for cotton planting in the area was more than 765,000 mu, but now more than 789,000 mu have been planted, exceeding the original plan by 24,000 mu. At the same time, because cotton farmers received the means of production in a timely manner, increased cotton production this year is even more guaranteed. According to a survey in Xima Village, Yuxiang County, the village earned a total of more than 7,600 jin of grain from pre-selling cotton, most of which, apart from a small portion for consumption, was used to purchase agricultural tools, waterwheels, and fertilizers and other means of production. In addition, the state-owned trading companies and cooperatives in the region also gained a practical understanding of the cotton production situation in the entire region through this pre-purchase of new cotton, providing a basis for how to focus investment in the future. Cotton farmers increased their trust in the cooperatives when signing pre-purchase contracts with them, and they requested to join the cooperatives one after another, so the cooperatives also achieved development. For example, the Xiangling County Cooperative originally had 6,000 members, but in this pre-purchase of cotton work, it has grown to 16,000 members.

　　晋南预购新棉成绩大
　  超过原订任务百分之三十
    山西省南部产棉区各国营贸易公司、合作社，在种棉前后以粮食和生产资料向棉农预购新棉共七百零一万五千多斤，超过原订任务百分之三十。通过预购新棉工作，棉农普遍认识到多种棉花支援国家工业的重要性。因此今年该地区种棉面积普遍扩大。仅据临汾专区十七个县的统计，该专区原计划种棉七十六万五千多亩，现已种了七十八万九千亩，超过原计划数二万四千亩。同时，由于棉农及时得到了生产资料，今年棉花增产就更有了保证。据虞乡县西马村的调查，全村收入预售棉花的粮食共七千六百多斤，除小部分食用外，大部用来购买农具、水车和肥料等生产资料。另外，该地区各国营贸易公司、合作社也通过这次预购新棉工作切实掌握了全区产棉情况，对今后如何有重点地进行投资有了根据。棉农在与合作社订立预购合同中，增加了对合作社的信任，纷纷要求入社，因此合作社也获得了发展。如襄陵县合作社原有社员六千人，在这次预购棉花工作中，已发展到一万六千人。
