　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 8th: The Korean "Labor News" published an editorial on the 7th, calling on the Korean people to heighten their vigilance against the enemy before a ceasefire is achieved. The editorial stated: The U.S. imperialists' expression of willingness to negotiate a ceasefire and armistice is a desperate measure taken today after their attempt to invade our motherland and enslave our people has completely failed. The editorial pointed out that the war over the past year has exposed the military and political corruption and incompetence of the American aggressors, and at the same time demonstrated the invincibility of the heroic Korean people who have taken up arms to resist the aggressors and fight for the salvation of their motherland.

　　The editorial pointed out: What needs special attention is that the expression of the U.S. imperialists is by no means equivalent to the realization of peace, and it must not be assumed that the U.S. imperialists have abandoned their ambition to invade us. This can be fully proved by everything the U.S. imperialists have done in the past on the international stage and in Korea. The editorial emphasized that imperialists are always cunning, insidious and treacherous, so we Korean people should be more vigilant against the enemy at this moment. The editorial issued a call to the Korean people: All the people and officers and soldiers of the People's Army must not mistakenly believe that peace has been achieved, and there must be no slackening or paralysis in their combat readiness or on the labor front. All officers and soldiers of the People's Army should be fully prepared for combat, ready to respond to possible enemy attacks with doubled blows. The people in the rear should further consolidate the ties between the front and the rear, redouble their efforts on the labor front, fully guarantee the needs of the front and the rear, and be vigilant against all enemies, saboteurs, special agents and rumor-mongers who attempt to disrupt our rear.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 8th: TASS, Pyongyang, 7th: All Korean newspapers continue to comment on the ceasefire proposal. The editorial of "Labor News" on July 6th stated: The Korean people are deeply convinced that this negotiation will be the first step towards a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. Since the United States launched its aggression against Korea a year ago, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has repeatedly proposed a peaceful solution to the Korean issue; however, these proposals have been rejected by the American aggressors. Only now, facing the complete failure of their adventure in Korea, and under the pressure of world public opinion demanding the withdrawal of the US-British intervention forces, has the US government had to agree to ceasefire negotiations.

　　The American imperialists launched armed aggression against Korea in an attempt to launch a war to dominate the world. The heroic struggle of the Korean people against the aggressors shattered this adventurous plan. Now, our people are no longer like they were during the Japanese rule before August 15, 1945. Today, our people have the means to decide their destiny and defend their freedom and independence.

　　Our entire people unanimously and firmly express their determination to fight to consolidate our ranks, heighten vigilance, and prevent the imperialists' conspiracy from hindering our just struggle for a peaceful, democratic, unified and independent Korea.

　　朝鲜《劳动新闻》号召朝鲜人民提高警惕
    准备随时回击敌人的可能进攻
    【新华社平壤八日电】朝鲜《劳动新闻》七日发表社论，号召朝鲜人民在停战实现之前提高对敌人的警惕性。社论称：美帝国主义者表示愿意谈判停火与休战，是在其侵略我们祖国奴役我们人民的企图完全遭到破产的今天不得已而采取的。社论指出，一年来的战争暴露了美国侵略者在军事和政治上的腐败无能，同时也显现了手执武器反抗侵略者为解救祖国命运而奋起进行正义斗争的英雄的朝鲜人民的不可战胜。
    社论指出：需要特别注意的是：美帝国主义者的表示，决不是就已经等于和平的实现，决不能认为美帝国主义者已放弃了侵略我们的野心，这在美帝国主义者过去在国际舞台上和在朝鲜所做的一切行动中可以得到充分的证明。社论着重指出：帝国主义者永远是狡猾阴险而奸诈的，因此我们朝鲜人民在此时此刻更应该提高对敌人的警惕性。社论对朝鲜人民发出号召说：全体人民和人民军官兵，决不可误以为和平业已取得，而在自己的战斗准备上或在劳动战线上有丝毫松懈或麻痹。人民军全体官兵应有充分的战斗准备，准备随时以加倍的打击来回答敌人的可能的进攻。后方人民要进一步巩固前方后方的联系，在劳动战线上加倍努力，完满地保障前后方的需要，对于妄图扰乱我们后方的一切敌人、暗害分子、特务破坏分子及造谣分子，要提高警惕性。
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社平壤七日电：全朝鲜各报继续评论停战建议。七月六日《劳动新闻》的社论称：朝鲜人民深信，这次谈判将是和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步。自从一年前美国侵略朝鲜以来，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府曾屡次建议和平解决朝鲜问题；但是这些建议都被美国侵略者拒绝了。只有现在，美国政府面临着他们在朝鲜冒险的彻底失败，同时在全世界公众要求撤退美英干涉军的压力下，才不得不同意谈判休战。
    美国帝国主义者对朝鲜发动武装侵略，是想借此发动独霸世界的战争。朝鲜人民反对侵略者的英勇的斗争，粉碎了这个冒险计划。现在，我国人民已经不像一九四五年八月十五日以前日本统治时期那样了。今天我国人民有办法决定他们的命运，保卫他们的自由与独立。
    我国全体人民一致坚决表示：决心要为巩固我们的队伍而斗争，提高警惕性，使帝国主义者的阴谋无法阻碍我们争取和平、民主与统一、独立的朝鲜的正义斗争。
