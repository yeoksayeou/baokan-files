The Communist Party of China is the leading party of the people's democratic united front which organized the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Today is the thirtieth anniversary of its founding. We are very honored to participate in this grand ceremony, and we cannot express enough our joy and excitement. We should first extend our heartfelt congratulations and highest respect to this great party and the great leader Chairman Mao.

For more than a hundred years, the Chinese people have waged continuous struggles against imperialism and feudalism, but they have all failed and could not find a correct path. The success of the Russian October Revolution in 1917 inspired the people of the world and changed the face of world history. Marxism-Leninism was also introduced to China. Under this influence, our great leader Chairman Mao and many revolutionary pioneers founded the Communist Party of China on this day thirty years ago.

Since the establishment of our leading party, the face of the Chinese revolution has completely changed, the direction of the revolution has become correct, and the strength of the revolution has become strong. Although it has gone through countless hardships and twists, it has finally been successfully achieved.

Regarding China, after achieving victory nationwide, it led us to establish the People's Republic of China, led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. In just twenty-one months, China has changed from a semi-colonial country to an independent and autonomous country, from being disunited to united, from being weak, poor, and culturally backward to becoming stronger and more prosperous day by day. China has not only stood up, but has also grown stronger, becoming a strong fortress for the liberation movement of the Eastern people and an important pillar for the anti-imperialist struggle of the world people.

Speaking of its impact on the world, the three valuable experiences that our leading party has gained in thirty years of revolutionary practice—a strong party, a united front, and revolutionary armed forces—have had a major guiding role in the revolutionary movements of colonial and semi-colonial countries around the world, and have increased their confidence in victory. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China has flexibly combined the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution. This glorious example will profoundly influence the revolutionary movements of people all over the world.

However, the history of thirty years has not passed peacefully. Its achievements have not been achieved smoothly. How the reactionary forces launched bloody attacks on the people, and how our leading party carried out arduous struggles, this generation has seen with its own eyes. "The 25,000-li Long March is a concrete manifestation of its unparalleled hardship and unparalleled glory."

Today, when we celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the Communist Party of China, we must not stop at verbal celebrations, or temporary celebrations, but must turn our enthusiasm for congratulations into practical actions. Resolutely and permanently follow the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, contribute all our strength, and strive to build a new China. Finally, on behalf of the members of the Democratic National Construction Association, I would like to pay tribute to all the comrades of the Communist Party of China, and pay tribute to the great people's leader Chairman Mao, and congratulate

Long live the glorious, great, and correctly led Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao.

　　民主建国会全国会务推进委员会召集人
    黄炎培的讲话
    中国共产党，是中华人民共和国人民政治协商会议靠他组织成功的人民民主统一战线的领导党，今天是它建立三十周年的日子。我们很荣幸地来参加这个盛大典礼，我们说不尽的愉快和兴奋。我们首先应该向这伟大的党和伟大的领袖毛主席致衷心的庆贺和崇高的敬礼。
    中国人民一百多年来，对帝国主义，对封建主义，进行了不断的斗争，但是都失败了，并且找不到正确的出路。一九一七年俄国十月革命成功，鼓舞了世界人心，转变了世界历史的面貌，马克思、列宁主义跟着也传到了中国。在这种影响之下，我们伟大的领袖毛主席和许多革命先进，就在三十年前的今天，创立了中国共产党。
    从我们的领导党建立以后，中国革命的面貌完全改变了，革命的方向正确了，革命的力量强大了，虽然还经过无数的艰难曲折，终于胜利地成功了。
    对中国，在取得全国范围的胜利后，它领导我们建立了以工人阶级为领导，以工农联盟为基础的中华人民共和国。仅仅二十一个月，中国由半殖民地的国家成为独立自主的国家了，由不统一而统一了，由衰弱、贫困、文化落后，变为一天一天强盛，一天一天繁荣了。中国不但是站起来了，并且壮大起来了，成为东方人民解放运动的坚强堡垒，成为世界人民反帝国主义斗争的重要支柱。
    就对世界的影响说起来，我们领导党经三十年的革命实践中所取得的三件宝贵经验——坚强的党，统一战线，革命的武装，已对全世界殖民地、半殖民地型的革命运动，发生了重大的指导作用，提高了他们胜利的信心。中国共产党在毛主席领导之下，把马列主义的普遍真理，和中国革命的具体实践，灵活地结合起来了。这种光辉的范例，将深刻地影响到全世界人民的革命运动。
    但是，三十年历史，不是和平地过去的。它的成就，不是顺利地取得的。反动势力怎样向人民进行血腥的进攻，我们领导党怎样进行艰苦的斗争，这一代的人，都是亲眼看到的。“二万五千里长征，是它无比的艰苦、无比的光荣的一种具体表现。”
    今天，我们庆祝中国共产党的三十周年，就不能停止于言词的庆祝，一时的庆祝，定要把我们祝贺的热忱，变为实际的行动。坚决地、永久地跟着中国共产党和毛主席，贡献一切力量，为建设新中国而奋斗。最后我代表民主建国会会员，谨再向中国共产党的全体同志致敬，向伟大的人民领袖毛主席致敬，祝贺
    光荣的、伟大的、领导正确的中国共产党和毛主席成功万岁。
