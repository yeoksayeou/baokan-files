　　Serious Attitude Lacking in Planning, Design, and Construction:
    Yangquan Mining Bureau Suffers from Severe Waste in Capital Construction;
    A Thorough Inspection Should Be Conducted According to the Instructions of the Central Financial and Economic Commission

    The State-owned Yangquan Mining Bureau's attitude towards capital construction is not serious or conscientious enough. Many construction projects have fallen into a state of chaos, and waste is very serious.

    The Third and Fourth Coal Mines and attached repair factory belonging to the bureau are large in scale. From March of last year to May of this year, the bureau carried out many major construction projects, with a total investment of over 15 million catties of millet. However, the bureau did not have long-term plans or a unified plan for capital construction, resulting in serious waste.

    The bureau did not have a unified plan for the use of land, resulting in the phenomenon of construction being changed in the morning and dismantled in the evening. For example, the Fourth Mine built eight workers' dormitories, which were demolished entirely less than two months after completion and less than a month of worker occupancy because another project needed the site. The foundation of a culvert nearly a thousand meters long was also completely abandoned due to changes in engineering design. The fence of the material warehouse was changed three times in less than half a year. The above three items alone wasted more than one million catties of millet.

    Many of the bureau's projects were blindly constructed without careful design. The Fourth Mine was building an extremely important warehouse, but designed the blueprint and began construction without a proper site inspection. As a result, the project address was changed twice after construction began, and a large amount of materials were moved back and forth. Some workers said angrily: "Bricks, tiles, wood, and stone are all on parade, millet is being thrown away recklessly! Are the bureau chief, mine manager, and engineers all asleep?" The water pipeline project of the Fourth Mine was changed and redone after nearly a thousand meters were completed because of serious obstructions that were discovered after the fact. The original design for the headlamp room of the Fourth Mine was eleven rooms, but the ground only allowed for seven rooms, and some people thought this was still "close enough." More seriously, the leading cadres of the bureau described this irresponsible attitude towards the people as "we have no experience" and "we are learning," even glorifying it as "seeking truth from facts." Their plans were often changed again and again, and the financial budget was repeatedly increased. One project's design was changed and the budget was increased as many as eight times. The 1950 statistics show that 17 projects (almost a quarter of the total) had their budgets increased once or several times, with a total increase of 4,774,400 catties of millet. The additional budget was mostly due to waste. The aforementioned construction of the warehouse in the Fourth Mine is an example. The additional 111,000 catties of millet for the project was almost equal to the cost of moving materials twice due to changes in the project address.

    In the bureau's capital construction, various systems were chaotic, and no one was responsible. Why could the bureau change plans and increase budgets at will? Because they did not implement an economic accounting system. The funds and equipment allocated by the North China Coal Industry Management Bureau, whether state investment or production funds, were used "wherever needed." The construction section, materials section, engineering section, and accounting section all worked independently. The construction section changed plans and increased budgets several times, but did not connect with the accounting section. The materials section had purchased the materials required for a project according to specifications, but the engineering section then contracted the entire project, including materials and labor, so the purchased materials had to be stored. After the completion of a project, the construction department did not notify the relevant departments to inspect the project or settle the accounts. Some projects had been completed for half a year and were already in use, but the accounting section's report to the higher authorities still stated that "the project has not been completed." A large amount of remaining material was discarded, with no one in charge. The responsibilities for project design, review, and construction were unclear. After a blueprint was designed and reviewed, no one signed or sealed it, making it difficult to hold anyone responsible after an accident. At the same time, after most projects were contracted to private merchants, there was no serious supervision or guidance, and no strict inspection system, so that private merchants had opportunities to exploit, and shoddy workmanship was rampant. The original design for the beams of the Third Mine's fan room was 30 centimeters, but the contractor used beams that were less than 25 centimeters. Within a dozen hours after completion, the main beam was bent and broken, almost causing a major accident in which workers were crushed and machines were destroyed. The original design for the headlamp room of the Fourth Mine was a double-brick wall, but it was changed to one and a half bricks during construction. As a result, the house collapsed before it was completed. In the newly built workers' dormitory of the Fourth Mine, the contractor violated the contract and split one rafter into two. The on-site supervisors of the bureau saw this but did not stop it or report it to the higher authorities. Most of the houses built by the bureau leaked rain. Many of them suffered from foundation subsidence and wall cracks after rain due to poor foundation tamping, and some had already collapsed. The new houses built by the Fourth Mine in the autumn of 1950 had already collapsed in the spring of this year.

    Since May of this year, the Yangquan Mining Bureau has conducted preliminary inspections and self-criticisms of this situation; but it is far from enough, and a serious inspection must be carried out to thoroughly improve the situation. (Wang Jinlin, Han Yongshou)

### 在计划、设计和施工上，态度都不严肃  阳泉矿务局基本建设浪费严重   应根据中央财经委员会指示彻底进行检查

　　在计划、设计和施工上，态度都不严肃
    阳泉矿务局基本建设浪费严重
    应根据中央财经委员会指示彻底进行检查
    国营阳泉矿务局对待基本建设的态度不够严肃认真，许多修建工作陷于混乱状态，浪费现象非常严重。
    该局所属第三、第四煤矿及附设修理厂规模宏大，从去年三月到今年五月，该局进行了许多重大建设，修建投资总额在一千五百万斤小米以上。但是，该局对待基本建设却没有长远打算和统一计划，以致造成严重浪费。
    该局对于地面的运用没有统一计划，因而建筑工程中有朝建暮改的现象。如四矿修建了八栋工人宿舍，竣工不到两个月，工人占用不满一月，就因另一工程需要这一块地基而全部拆除。近千公尺的涵洞根基，也因工程设计改变而全部废弃。材料库的围墙在不足半年的时间内更改三次。以上三项即浪费小米一百余万斤。
    该局不少工程没有周密设计就盲目施工。四矿建筑一所极端重要的库房，没经过很好地实地视察，就设计出图案，并进行施工。结果因地点选择不当，施工后工程地址又变更两次，大量材料来回搬运。有的工人气愤地说：“砖、瓦、木、石大游行，小米瞎球扔！局长、矿长、工程师都睡了觉了？”四矿的自来水道工程因事前未很好测量，完成近千公尺后，因遇严重阻碍，又改线重做。四矿修建头灯房原设计修十一间，而地面只允许修七间，有些人还认为这总还“八、九不离十”。更严重的是该局领导干部把这种对人民不负责的作风，说成“我们是没经验的”，“是在学习”，甚至美其名曰是“实事求是”。他们的计划往往一变再变，财政预算再三追加。有一件工程变更设计追加预算达八次之多。一九五○年统计即有十七件工程（几占全数的四分之一）经过一次或数次追加预算，总共追加小米四百七十七万四千斤。而追加的预算又大部是因浪费所致。前述四矿修建库房就是一例，该项工程追加的小米十一万一千斤，差不多只等于两次变更工程地址移动材料的费用。
    该局在进行基本建设中，各种制度混乱，无人负责。为什么该局能够随便变更计划追加预算呢？因为他们没有实行经济核算制。华北煤业管理总局拨来的款项、器材，不管是国家的投资还是生产经费，该局是“那儿需要就那儿用”。建筑科、材料科、工程科、会计科各自为政。建筑科数次变动计划与追加预算，但不与会计科连系。材料科已把某项工程所用材料按照规格采办妥当了，而工程科却又把这项工程工料全部包出去，所买材料只好存放起来。工程竣工后施工部门不通知有关部门检收工程，不结算账目。有的工程竣工已经半年，并且业已使用，而会计科向上的报告还一直是“工程尚未完竣”。所余大量材料全部抛弃，无人经管。工程设计、审核、施工职责不明确，一个图案设计审核后没有人签名盖章，发生事故后不易追究责任。同时大部工程出包给私商后，既不进行认真的监督与指导，又没有严格的检查制度，致使私商有机可投，偷工减料现象层出不穷。三矿风机房梁木原设计为三十公分，但包商用的是不足二十五公分的，在竣工后十数小时内即发生大梁弯曲折断，几乎造成砸死工人砸毁机器的重大事故。四矿头灯房原设计为双砖墙垛，施工后改为一砖半。结果房未做起，即发生倒塌现象。四矿新建工人宿舍，包商违背合同，将一根椽木劈开顶两根用。该局现场监工人员，见到后既未制止，也未向上级报告。该局所建房屋大部漏雨，其中不少因根基打夯不力，下雨后根石下陷，墙壁崩裂，有的已经倒塌。四矿一九五○年秋季建的新房，今年春季即有倒塌的。
    今年五月以来，阳泉矿务局对此种情况已作了初步检查与检讨；但还非常不够，尚须认真进行检查，以求彻底改进。（王金林、韩永寿）
