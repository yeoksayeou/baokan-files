　　Jinzhou's Production Increase and Donation Campaign is Flourishing

　　"Get the five donated planes to the front lines ahead of schedule!" The people of Jinzhou are taking action under this battle cry of patriotic slogan. They have already generally established production increase and donation plans, and are vigorously launching the production increase and donation campaign according to these plans. So far, the donation plans of factories, government agencies, schools, and rural masses in the suburbs have been basically completed; 70% of street residents have established their plans; and the business community has established preliminary donation plans for 30 industries.

　　These plans were formulated after deliberation and discussion by the masses. During the process of formulating the plans, people from all walks of life realized their enormous production potential, and their confidence in completing the donation tasks was further consolidated. Everyone felt: "Donating five planes is absolutely no problem." Moreover, what made everyone even happier was that "these planes are produced by extra production."

　　The establishment of production increase and donation plans by the people of Jinzhou was conducted in a guided manner. At the beginning of the donation campaign, the leadership at all levels carefully studied and discussed the proclamation issued by the General Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea on June 1st, and understood the spirit of launching the donation campaign on the basis of increasing production and increasing income. Starting in mid-June, the city first mobilized forces from all aspects to launch a large-scale publicity campaign to convey the spirit of the call of the General Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea to the masses. At the same time, the Jinzhou Branch of the Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea selected key points in factories, shops, and among street residents to help the masses formulate plans, and then summarized their experiences and promoted and introduced them to all aspects through newspapers, radio broadcasts, meetings, or printed materials. The branches of the Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea also carried out pilot demonstration work for formulating plans among the masses, and organized other small units to learn and observe, comprehensively promoting the work of formulating plans.

　　Before formulating plans, all small units underwent deliberation and discussion by the masses, under the encouragement of patriotic enthusiasm. Everyone used their brains to come up with many ways to increase production and increase income. Many units came up with more than a dozen or even dozens of practical and feasible methods for increasing production and donations.

　　Judging from the production increase and donation plans of people from all walks of life, the enormous production potential of the people is astonishing. Zhu Guohua, a model worker in a factory, led the workers in his workshop to learn advanced working methods and rationally allocate labor organization. Within half a year, the value of increased production for the country was equivalent to 57 tons of grain; after formulating a plan to improve business management, Fushenghe Grocery Store's income in the second half of the year could increase by about 80% compared to the first half of the year; after careful calculation, the income of the fourth residents' group in Nü'er Street would increase by 13%. These facts educated the masses and also educated many cadres, making everyone clearly see that the production increase and donation campaign can not only support the front lines and consolidate national defense, but also promote the country's construction cause and increase the wealth of the masses themselves. In the past, many cadres believed that "plans cannot be made," "nothing can be made," and "it is easier to apportion tasks." Now, these erroneous theories have been refuted by facts.

　　The masses who have formulated plans have begun to pour their patriotic enthusiasm into actions to increase production and increase income according to the plans. In just one month, there have been many achievements. Liaoxi Construction Company, Food Company, and three other factories have reported frequent good news: they have improved output and quality, reduced costs, overfulfilled or completed production tasks ahead of schedule, and reduced defective and rework products. Employees of the transportation company dedicated a day of labor on July 1st, dispatched 10 cars and 580 carts, and donated 28 million yuan from the increased income of that day. In the rural areas of the suburbs, in order to complete the plan of intensive cultivation and fine farming, four hoeings and three weedings, and increasing grain production by 10 to 15 kilograms per mu, men, women, and children went to the fields, and most of the suburban farmland has now completed three hoeings and two weedings. The group led by agricultural labor model Yao Yuzhang has hoeed the crops four times and weeded three times. They plan to hoe the large fields five times and weed four times, hoe the cotton fields six times and weed six times, and prepare to apply a large amount of topdressing fertilizer and adopt scientific insect control methods, resolutely completing the production increase and donation plan of increasing gaoliang production by 30 kilograms or cotton by 20 kilograms per mu. All the women and militiamen in Jintun Village have already donated the first batch of 1.8 million yuan earned from increased production and savings. Many stores in the city have begun new management methods, increasing capital, organizing sales, and preparing for joint operations. The fur processing industry is preparing to purchase raw hides from the northwestern provinces to increase income. The Democratic Women's Federation of Xiaoling Street organized a large number of women to learn to sew gloves, and will soon be able to earn more than 2 million yuan in wages. On Tian'an Street, 67 women were the first to enter factories to sew burlap bags, and many women opened laundries. A large number of elderly people and children are collecting scrap iron. The literary and art circles have held 21 donation performances. Under the influence of everyone's patriotic enthusiasm, the relatively backward strata have also been mobilized. Some wealthy households with backward ideas have also actively participated in the donation campaign.

　　In order to ensure that the patriotic production increase and donation plans of people from all walks of life can be implemented, the Jinzhou branches of the Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea began a general inspection in early July. The inspection revealed that a small part of the plans were formulated relatively hastily. This was mainly caused by the eagerness of the leadership, and there were also individual small units that only considered saving money and reducing expenses, and did not think of ways to increase production and increase income. In addition, there were individual plans that set the conditions too low, which did not match the actual situation. Now, the city is mobilizing the masses of these units to revise the production increase and donation plans, while vigorously publicizing and mobilizing the masses to discuss preferential treatment work, concretizing these two patriotic tasks, and incorporating their main content into patriotic covenants.

　　After the news of the Korean armistice negotiations was announced, the Jinzhou Branch of the Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea successively held two symposiums for people from all walks of life; people from all walks of life also discussed this issue, and everyone realized that: "Regardless of whether the negotiations are successful or not, we must be vigilant and guard against U.S. imperialism playing tricks and conspiracies. The work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea cannot be relaxed in the slightest, and the patriotic donation campaign must continue to advance, and we must work harder to dedicate the planes earlier, consolidate our national defense, and peace will be more guaranteed."

### 锦州市的增产捐献运动在蓬勃开展中

　　锦州市的增产捐献运动在蓬勃开展中
　　李坚
    “把捐献的五架飞机，提前开上前线去!”锦州人民在这一战斗的爱国口号下行动起来了。他们已经普遍订立了增产捐献计划，又按着计划，蓬勃地展开了增产捐献运动。到目前为止，各工厂、机关、学校和郊区农村群众的捐献计划，基本上已全部订完；街道居民已有百分之七十订出了计划；工商界则已有三十个行业订出了初步的捐献计划。
    这些计划，是经过群众的酝酿讨论后订出来的。在订计划的过程中，各阶层人民都发觉了自己有巨大的生产潜力，完成捐献任务的信心因而更加巩固。大家都感到：“捐献五架飞机绝没有问题。”而且，更使大家高兴的是：“这些飞机是额外增产出来的。”
    锦州人民的订立增产捐献计划，是有领导地进行的。捐献运动开始时，各级领导机关就很好地学习和讨论了抗美援朝总会六月一日发出的文告，体会了必须在增加生产、增加收入的基础上来开展捐献运动的精神。从六月中旬起，全市首先动员各方面的力量，展开了大规模的宣传工作，把抗美援朝总会号召的精神贯彻到群众中去。与此同时，市抗美援朝分会又在工厂、商店与街道居民中间，选择重点帮助群众订计划，然后总结他们的经验，通过报纸、广播、开会或印刷材料向各方面推广介绍。各抗美援朝支会，也在群众中作了订计划的试点示范工作，并组织其他小单位学习观摩，全面推动了订计划的工作。
    各小单位在订立计划之前，都经过了群众的酝酿讨论，在爱国热情的鼓舞下。大家都开动脑筋，想出许多增加生产、增加收入的办法。有许多单位想出的切实可行的增产捐献办法，都有十几种甚至几十种。
    从各阶层人民的增产捐献计划来看，人民群众生产潜力的巨大是惊人的。某工厂的劳动模范朱国华，领导全车间工人学习先进工作方法，合理调配劳动组织，半年内可为国家增产的价值相当于五十七吨粮食；福生合杂货店，订出改善经营、管理的计划之后，下半年的收入可比上半年增加百分之八十左右；女儿街第四居民组，精打细算的结果，他们的收入将能增加百分之十三。这些事实，教育了群众，也教育了许多干部，使大家确切地看到增产捐献运动，不仅能支援前线、巩固国防，而且将推动国家的建设事业，也增加群众自己的财富。过去，不少干部认为“计划没法订”，“订不出什么来”“不如摊派省事”。现在这些错误的理论、已经被事实驳倒了。
    订出了计划的群众，已经开始按计划把爱国热情灌注到增加生产，增加收入的行动中去。短短的一个月，就有了许多成绩。辽西建设公司、食品公司以及另外的三个工厂，都是喜报频传：提高了产量、质量，降低了成本，超额或提前完成了生产任务，减少了废品和返工品。搬运公司职工，在七月一日献工一天，出动了汽车十辆和大车五百八十辆，捐献了这一天所增加的收入二千八百万元。在郊区农村，为完成精耕细作、四铲三趟，每亩增产粮食十斤至十五斤的计划，男女老幼都下了地，现在郊区农田大部完成了三铲两趟。农业劳动模范么玉章领导的小组，庄稼地已经铲了四遍，趟了三遍，他们计划大田五铲四趟，棉田六铲六趟，并预备大量施追肥，并采用科学除虫方法，坚决完成每亩增产高粮三十斤或棉花二十斤的增产捐献计划。金家屯全村的妇女、民兵，已经把第一批增产、节约所得的一百八十万元捐献了出来。市内许多商店开始了新的经营、管理方法，增加资金、组织推销，并准备联营。皮毛加工业正在筹备到西北各省采购原料皮张，以增加收入。小凌街的民主妇女联合会，组织了大批妇女学习缝手套，不久就可收入工资二百多万元。天安街有六十七名妇女首批进入工厂缝麻袋，还有许多妇女开设了浆洗房。大批老年人和儿童，正在收集废铁。文艺界已举办了二十一场捐献义演。在大家的爱国热情的影响下，较落后的阶层也被带动起来了。某些思想落后的殷实户，也踊跃参加了捐献运动。
    为了使各界人民的爱国增产捐献计划能贯彻执行，锦州市各抗美援朝支会在七月上旬开始了普遍检查。检查中发现已订的计划中，有一小部分订得比较草率。这主要是因为领导人员急于求成所造成的，也有个别的小单位。单纯从节衣缩食方面打算盘，而没有从增加生产、增加收入上想办法。另有个别的计划，所订条件太低，不合实际情况。现在该市正发动这些单位的群众修订增产捐献计划，同时大力宣传和发动群众讨论优抚工作，把这两项爱国工作具体化，并将其主要内容订入爱国公约之内。
    朝鲜停战谈判的消息发表以后，锦州市抗美援朝分会又接连召开了两次各界人民的座谈会；各界人民群众也纷纷讨论了这一问题，大家都认识到：“不管谈判能不能成功，我们必须提高警惕，严防美帝国主义耍阴谋，玩花招。抗美援朝工作丝毫也不能松懈，爱国捐献运动要继续推进，而且要更加努力，早些把飞机献出来，巩固我们的国防，和平才会更有保障。”
