  The Method of Establishing Study Groups for Industrialists and Businessmen in Beijing Should Be Advocated and Promoted
　　Under the leadership of the district consultative committees and district public offices, most industrialists and businessmen in Beijing have established organizations for study groups for industrialists and businessmen based on the spirit of self-management and self-study, and have systematically studied policies, laws and decrees, and current affairs, which has played a significant role in promoting the government's policies, laws and decrees, and enhancing the understanding of industrialists and businessmen on the current situation. The working class has taken the initiative to unite with the capitalists to improve production, resulting in a significant shift in labor-capital relations. However, improving labor-capital relations is a two-way street. Therefore, systematically guiding capitalists to study will play a significant role in improving labor-capital relations, enhancing the enthusiasm of capitalists in management, and improving the understanding of industrialists and businessmen on the current situation and political awareness. This method of organizing capitalists to study in Beijing should be advocated and promoted.
  People's Bank of China Issues Fixed-Amount Railway Freight Checks
　　The People's Bank of China and the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government jointly formulated the "Measures for the Issuance and Use of Fixed-Amount Railway Freight Checks," which was approved by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government and decided to implement it from August 1st. The fixed-amount railway freight checks are in denominations of 10 million yuan, 5 million yuan, 1 million yuan, 500,000 yuan, and 100,000 yuan. In addition to being issued by the General Business Office of the People's Bank of China, branches in 18 cities including Beijing, Tianjin, Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang, Zhangjiakou, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Jinan, Bengbu, Xuzhou, Xi'an, Hankou, Wuchang, Nanchang, Zhengzhou, Hengyang, Liuzhou, and Guangzhou are designated as the first batch of issuing banks. After August 1st, government agencies and state-owned enterprises in the above-mentioned locations where railway freight checks are issued can exchange them at local People's Banks based on the amount of railway freight needed for their transportation plans. These checks are accepted for use at any freight handling station within the customs, but are not applicable in Northeast China and Inner Mongolia for the time being. Railway freight checks can only be accepted by railway stations and are not allowed to be circulated on the market or used for other purposes, nor can they be cashed at banks. The purpose of issuing these fixed-amount checks is to save cash and simplify railway freight payment procedures.

  北京市建立工商业者学习会的办法应该提倡和推广
    北京市大多数区的工商业者，在区协商委员会和区公所的领导下，本着自办自学的精神，已建立起工商业者学习会的组织，有计划地学习政策、法令和时事，对推行政府政策法令，提高工商业者对目前时局的认识，起了很大作用。工人阶级主动地团结资方搞好生产，使劳资关系有了很大的转变。但是，搞好劳资关系是两方面的事，因而有计划地引导资本家学习，对搞好劳资关系，提高资本家的经营积极性及提高工商业者对目前时局和政治认识等方面将起重大的作用。北京市组织资本家学习的这一办法应该提倡和推广。
