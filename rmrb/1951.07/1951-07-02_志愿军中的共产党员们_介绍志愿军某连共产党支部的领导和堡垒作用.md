　　Communist Party Members in the Chinese People's Volunteers
　　--An Introduction to the Leadership and Fortress Role of a Communist Party Branch in a Company of the Chinese People's Volunteers
　　Zhou Wenjiang (Oral Account) Wu Ming, Gu Weijin (Reporters)

　　I am a Communist Party member, serving as the battalion chief of staff in a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers. As we commemorate the 30th anniversary of our Party's birthday – "July 1st" – I am further reminded that the reason our Chinese People's Volunteers were able to defeat the world's most powerful and ferocious American imperialism so decisively is due to the Party's strong leadership. Now, I will talk about the leadership and fortress role of a Communist Party branch in a combat company I commanded on the Korean Eastern Front last year.

　　In mid-November last year, heavy snow was constantly falling, and the Yalu River was frozen over. The American invading army, with over 100,000 troops from the 1st Marine Division, 3rd Division, and 7th Division, advanced towards our motherland's border. Under these intolerable circumstances, we answered the call of the motherland, formed the Chinese People's Volunteers to resist America, aid Korea, and defend our homes and country, and stepped onto the front lines of national defense. At that time, I was the battalion chief of staff in the 2nd Battalion of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers and a member of the battalion Party committee. According to the division of labor within the battalion Party committee, I was responsible for leading the work of the Fifth Company's branch and commanding the Fifth Company in combat. The Fifth Company, like other companies in the Volunteers, had a Communist Party organization that played a central and leading role. Party members accounted for more than half of the company's personnel, and there were twenty-two members of the Communist Youth League. These highly conscious people's soldiers, carrying the hopes of the people of the motherland, crossed the Yalu River and advanced towards the direction of the enemy's attack.

　　We entered the mountainous terrain of North Korea, where everywhere we saw houses burning after being struck by enemy planes, women and children displaced in the ravines, and Korean civilians being killed on the roads and in the towns and villages. These tragic and unbearable facts aroused the righteous indignation of each and every one of us. Under the leadership of the Party branch, we faced our motherland, gripped our guns tightly, and made a solemn oath: "Avenge the Korean people! Resolutely prevent the disaster from befalling our motherland! Earn merit for the people of our motherland!" We continued to advance towards the direction of the enemy's attack!

　　The harsh winter in North Korea often meant water turning to ice and breath condensing into frost. Deep snow covered the sparsely populated mountain villages and continuous mountain ridges. The extreme cold, coupled with arduous tasks, created many difficulties for us. However, in the face of the Communists, in the face of the Volunteers fighting for justice, the difficulties were overcome. We marched day and night. The branch called out: "Overcoming difficulties is the primary condition for defeating the American invading army." Comrades responded to the call of the branch, gritted their teeth, and persevered in moving forward! On the road ahead, a large mountain – Duck Head Ridge, fifteen li high – stood in our way. The snow on the mountain was knee-deep, and the road was submerged in the snow. Under the encouragement and leadership of the branch and led by Party members, the soldiers climbed to the top of the mountain in one hour. Descending was even more difficult, but we came up with a way to overcome the difficulties and slid down from the top of the mountain. Zhou Yueshe, a member of the Youth League in the Fifth Platoon who was suffering from malaria, did not fall behind a single step. He was determined to earn merit and join the Party in the first battle test.

　　After the troops arrived at the assembly point, the Party branch and the administration separately convened meetings of Party members, Youth League members, cadres, soldiers, and model workers to conduct in-depth mobilization and formulate the company's "Plan for Striving for Victory in the First Battle, Earning Merit, and Creating a Model"; the company was called upon to "We cannot rely solely on courage to fight the American invading army; we must pay attention to tactics, improve skills, strengthen air defense, study how to fight tanks, and fight battles we are sure of winning."

　　The Fifth Platoon was the first to respond to the call of the Party and the administration. The Fifth Platoon had the most Party members in the company and was known as the "Backbone Model Platoon." Platoon Leader Fan Yutian was the deputy branch secretary. The entire platoon wrote a letter of request to the higher authorities with a guarantee. Liu Shengzuo, the Youth League Committee member and deputy platoon leader of the First Platoon, also expressed his determination to the youth of the entire company, and the youth of the entire company submitted letters requesting to fight. Under the leadership of Party and Youth League members, each platoon sent its letters of determination to the company headquarters. Gao Shouhe, the deputy platoon leader of the Fifth Platoon, said at the meeting: "We will not bow to any difficulties; we are the Chinese people educated by Chairman Mao." All the soldiers of the company rolled up their sleeves and checked their weapons. The company commander seized the time to provide military education to everyone.

　　The branch also mobilized all Party members to lead the masses in implementing mutual assistance in ideology, technology, and physical strength, and conducted in-depth explanations and mobilizations to address the ideological concerns of some people. To comrades who were afraid of airplanes, they said: "Airplanes fly fast but are not accurate. As long as you pay attention to concealment, it doesn't matter." To comrades who had never seen tanks, they explained in detail: "Tanks are clumsy, not flexible in movement, and have small observation holes, so they can't see far. As long as we can use the terrain and hit their tracks from the side, we can definitely subdue them." ... After universal ideological mutual assistance, the morale of the entire company became even more full. Under the unified leadership of the branch, each platoon formulated its own plan for earning merit. When the company called for volunteers to attack tanks, seventy-six comrades immediately volunteered (after research, twenty-seven were selected).

　　On the day of the battle, the work of "checking preparations and checking morale" was carried out again. After conveying the specific tasks, everyone was in high spirits, full of confidence, and entered the interception battle of Xixingli.

　　At 9:00 PM, the troops searched and advanced, illuminated by the snow. In the snow-covered mountains without roads, we passed through dense pine forests and thorny bushes. Our mission was to insert ourselves into the middle of the enemy's 1st Marine Division's position, cut off the enemy in the middle, so as to divide and encircle them. This was an extremely difficult task. Tens of thousands of enemies were stationed along the twenty-plus li of the highway from Liutanli to Xiajieyuli, with forces far exceeding ours. However, the Fifth Company, under the strong leadership of the Party, disregarded everything and inserted itself into the heart of the enemy like a sharp knife. When we climbed a large mountain, we saw raging fires ignited by the American bandits everywhere below the mountain, burning from south to north, all the way towards the Yalu River. Filled with anger towards the enemy, the soldiers disregarded the height of the mountains, the danger of the roads, and the cold weather, and rolled down the mountain. Thorns tore through people's clothes and scratched people's hands and faces. At dawn, we had already inserted ourselves onto the highway. This was the enemy's major north-south transportation artery, and all the enemies advancing north were moving along this highway. As soon as we arrived, a small jeep came head-on. The "Backbone Model" Fifth Platoon rushed down the mountain, and after a burst of machine gun fire, more than a dozen gleaming bayonets were pointed at the chests of five American devils in the car. Comrade Fan Yutian, the platoon leader of the Fifth Platoon, shouted two sentences in English about treating prisoners leniently, and the five American devils immediately knelt down on both knees and obediently became prisoners. After completing the task, the soldiers' confidence in eliminating the enemy was further enhanced. The branch committee promptly convened a flying meeting and carried out mobilization. The entire company then deployed its forces on the mountain north of the enemy's 1st Marine Division headquarters (Xiajieyuli), cut off the enemy's wires, deployed the anti-tank team on the highway, and the troops guarded the road junctions. At this point, the enemy's north-south transportation was cut off by our Fifth Company.

　　Around 8:00, two tanks and four trucks loaded with enemy soldiers suddenly appeared on the highway. When the enemy approached us about 100 meters away, I ordered all weapons to fire at once, immediately destroying the tanks and overturning the trucks, and the troops rushed forward. The driver on the first tank had just exposed half of his body when he was killed. A guy on another tank, flustered and without even wearing his coat, with two socks on his hands for some reason, was captured alive by us. Most of the remaining enemies were killed or wounded. We had no casualties. The soldiers' morale was even higher. But the branch immediately estimated that the enemy had been annihilated so easily twice because they were caught off guard. Now the enemy has realized that we are like a sword stabbed beside its heart, and it will certainly not be willing to accept this. We must prepare quickly. I ordered a readjustment of the deployment. The soldiers built strong fortifications on the mountain tops.

　　A quarter of an hour later, a dozen airplanes came. Followed by four tanks, covering more than two hundred infantry, and launched an attack on our position on several routes. Two tanks rushed near our position. Model Party member Liu Peisan, the deputy platoon leader of the Third Platoon, led two soldiers to pounce on the tanks. A few meters from the tank, he raised a grenade and prepared to throw it at the tank when he was unfortunately hit by enemy machine gun fire and gloriously sacrificed himself. When he threw the grenade, one leg was kneeling, his left hand was pressing on the ground, and after the sacrifice, his body did not fall, his right hand was still holding up the grenade that he had not thrown. Like a heroic statue, he stood on the enemy's tank advancing road. The two tanks behind him never dared to move forward. Another tank wanted to rush up our army's position from the side. Comrade Gong Zhenhua, a soldier who asked to join the Party before the war, stood up, braving the sweeping of several heavy machine guns on the tank, aimed at the tank's observation hole, and fired a burst of machine gun bullets, killing the enemy driver. The enemy's tank never moved again. Then the two tanks behind were also destroyed. Our Second Platoon then launched several consecutive attacks and repelled the enemy. Due to enemy reinforcements, the soldiers did not have time to check the number of enemy deaths and actively prepared for another battle.

　　A more fierce battle began. The enemy probably already realized its impending doom, and therefore fiercely attacked our position. Twenty or thirty planes bombed in turn, and cannons fired in bursts. The small pine trees on the mountain were destroyed, and the position was filled with smoke. The white mountain top turned black. On our two-li wide and long position, there was a large artillery shell pit every two meters. The devils counterattacked us frantically from all directions. All the comrades of the Fifth Company fought hard.

　　The most intense battle was also the time when the Party's work was most active.

　　Instructor Zhu Liangyu shuttled back and forth through the fire net, directing the battle. Based on the changing situation and everyone's combat situation, he conducted on-the-spot flying mobilization, and handed the "Certificate of Honor" to the comrades who had made meritorious achievements in combat. Soon, he was hit by an enemy shell and shouted before sacrificing himself: "Win glory for the motherland! Don't forget our hatred and determination, avenge the Chinese and Korean people! Long live the Communist Party!" The noble qualities and heroic actions of this Communist Party member and excellent political worker greatly encouraged the fighting spirit of the troops. Cui Shengkun, a twenty-one-year-old Communist Party member and deputy squad leader of the Eighth Squad, immediately jumped out of the position to replace the political instructor in mobilizing and commanding the troops.

　　The battle was extremely fierce.

　　Comrade Zhang Jinlong, a young soldier who had always expressed his desire to join the Youth League in battle before the war, rushed into the enemy ranks alone and was surrounded by the enemy. He held on in a mountain depression, and the enemy attacked him continuously, and he killed two of them. He held on until dark and returned to the position safely. In the evening, he gloriously joined the Youth League.

　　On the first day of the battle, we repelled the enemy's twenty-three large and small charges. Inflicting extremely heavy casualties on the enemy. After 10:00 PM that night, the enemy dared not attack again. Li Mingkun, the organization committee member of the branch and deputy platoon leader of the Third Platoon, and the deputy company commander immediately convened a branch committee meeting, adjusted the squad and platoon organization, and promoted and supplemented the casualties of the branch committee group leaders and administrative cadres at all levels. The leadership of the branch was replenished in a timely manner.

　　In the subsequent six days of battle, the enemy attacked every day. Because on the first day I gave the enemy a head-on blow, seriously frustrating the enemy's fierce flame, its attacking spirit was far inferior to the first day. But the bombing of the planes and the bursts of artillery fire became more and more intensified day by day. The extreme cold of minus thirty degrees was also a severe test for the soldiers. Many people's hands, feet, and faces were frostbitten. Party members and cadres took the lead, gritted their teeth and persevered. Li Mingkun, the organization committee member of the branch, had frostbite on both feet, but he did not complain at all, running up and down to arrange work, and using the gaps in the battle to get food for the soldiers. In the event of an emergency with artillery fire, Party members and cadres told the soldiers to hide and monitored the enemy themselves. Party member Chen Guozhi touched down the mountain at night and picked up a dozen enemy blankets, tore them open and wrapped the soldiers' hands and faces, and he went to the mountain ditch to find some straw and spread it in the fortifications for the comrades.

　　In the continuous battle, the branch put forward the slogan "Avenge the instructor and the sacrificed comrades," and launched each class to discuss how to overcome difficulties and strive to be a large meritorious company in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and defending the country. In the latter few days, the enemy attacked less often, and the branch promptly proposed: "Prevent slackness and complacency, overcoming difficulties is victory." It held an enlarged meeting of the branch committee, conveyed the superior Party committee's commendation to the company, and the news that fraternal troops had won a great victory in Liutanli because the Fifth Company had blocked the enemy's reinforcements in Xiajieyuli. The Party's small group meetings seized the time to meet, commended combat models, widely exchanged combat experience, and studied ways to fight American devils. And with Party members as the core, encouraged everyone to be prepared for battle at any time.

　　In the seven days and nights of arduous battle, the Party branch committee held five meetings, which always ensured the high fighting spirit of the troops, overcame difficulties, and killed and wounded more than 300 enemies at a smaller cost, powerfully cooperating with our army's battle to annihilate more than 10,000 enemies in the Changjin Lake area, and successfully completed the combat mission.

　　Thanks to the strong leadership of the Party branch and the exemplary role of the Communist Party members, the Fifth Company made great contributions to the people of the motherland in this battle. It was commended by the higher authorities. At the division's conference of model workers, eighteen meritorious persons above the second-class merit from the Fifth Company participated. I was also rated as a meritorious hero and combat hero as a commander. The reason I was able to get this glorious title is entirely the result of the correct command of the higher authorities, the efforts of the Party branch of the Fifth Company, all the Communist Party members, and all the comrades, and the immortal merits of the gloriously sacrificed martyrs. In the glorious days of commemorating the 30th anniversary of the Party, it made me feel even more deeply the greatness, glory, and correctness of our Party. Let us shout!

　　Long live the great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party!

　　Long live Chairman Mao!

　　志愿军中的共产党员们
    ——介绍志愿军某连共产党支部的领导和堡垒作用
    周文江  口述  吴明  古维进  记
    我是一个共产党员，在中国人民志愿军某部担任营参谋长。在纪念我们党的生日——“七一”三十周年的时候，我进一步想到我们志愿军所以能将世界上最强大凶恶的美帝国主义打得落花流水，都是由于党的坚强领导。现在我谈谈去年朝鲜东线我所指挥的一个战斗连队共产党支部的领导和堡垒作用。
    去年十一月中旬，天上不断地飘着鹅毛大雪，鸭绿江水封起来。美国侵略军以陆战第一师、第三师、第七师十万余众，向我祖国边疆进犯。在这忍无可忍的情况下，我们响应了祖国的召唤，组成抗美援朝保家卫国志愿军，踏上了国防最前线。那时我在志愿军某部二营任营参谋长，并是营党委委员，按营党委的分工，由我来领导五连支部工作，指挥五连战斗。五连，和志愿军其他连队一样，有共产党的组织在其中起着核心与领导作用。党员占全连人数半数以上，青年团员有二十二名。这些具有高度觉悟的人民战士，背负着祖国人民的希望，跨过鸭绿江迎着敌人进攻的方向前进。
    我们进入北朝鲜多山的土地，到处都是被敌人飞机击中燃烧的房屋，妇女孩子在山沟里流离，城镇山村或公路上不断有被打死的朝鲜老百姓。这些惨不忍闻的事实，激起我们每一个人的义愤。在党的支部领导下，我们面对着祖国，紧握着我们的枪，举行了庄严的宣誓：“为朝鲜人民报仇！坚决不让灾难落到祖国的大地上！为祖国人民立功”。我们继续迎着敌人进攻的方向前进！
    北朝鲜的严冬，经常是滴水成冰，呵气凝霜。深厚的积雪覆盖着稀落的山村和连绵的山岗。奇寒的天气，加上艰巨的任务，给我们造成许多困难。但是，在共产党人的面前，在为正义而战的志愿军面前，困难都被战胜了。我们日夜兼程的挺进。支部号召：“克服困难是战胜美国侵略军的首要条件。”同志们响应支部的号召，咬紧牙关，坚持前进！在前进的路上，横着一座高十五里的大山——鸭头岭，山上积雪过膝，路都被大雪淹没了。战士们在支部的鼓舞号召和党员带领之下，一小时便爬上了山顶。下山时更艰难，但我们想出了克服困难的办法，从山顶上滑了下去。五班正发疟疾的周玉社也没有掉下一步。他是青年团员，坚决要在首次战斗的考验中立功入党。
    部队到达集结地点后，支部与行政即分别召开党员、团员、干部、战士、功臣等会议，作深入动员，制订了全连《争取首战胜利立功创模方案》；向全连提出了“我们不能只靠勇气和美国侵略军作战，必须讲究战术，提高技术，加强防空，研究如何打坦克，要打有把握的仗”。
    五班首先响应党与行政的号召。五班是全连党员最多的一个班，号称“骨干模范班”，班长范玉田同志是副支部书记。全班向上级写了有保证的请战书。支部青年委员一排副刘生左同志也向全连青年表示决心，全连青年纷纷上书请战。各班都在党、团员带领之下，把自己的决心书送到连部。五班副高守河同志在会上表示：“我们不向任何困难低头，我们是毛主席教育出来的中国人民”。全连战士们摩拳擦掌，检查自己的武器。连长抓紧时间给大家进行军事教育。
    支部又发动全体党员，带领广大群众，实行思想、技术、体力三方面的互助，并针对某些人思想上的顾虑，进行深入的解释动员。对怕飞机的同志说：“飞机它飞的快，打不准，只要注意隐蔽就没关系”。对没见过坦克的同志详细解释：“坦克是笨家伙，运动不灵，了望孔小，看不远，只要我们能利用地形，从侧面打它的履带，一定能制住它。”……经过普遍思想互助，全连情绪更为饱满。在支部统一领导下，各班都制定了自己的立功计划。连里号召自动报名打坦克时，立刻便有七十六个同志报名（经过研究后确定了二十七人）。
    投入战斗的当天，又进行了“查准备，查斗志”的工作，传达了具体任务后，大家情绪高涨，信心百倍，投入了西兴里的截击战。
    夜九时，部队映着雪光搜索前进。在没路的大雪山上，穿过密集的松林和刺人的灌木丛。我们的任务是插到敌人陆战第一师阵地的中间，将敌人拦腰斩断，以便分割围剿。这是一个异常艰巨的任务。几万敌人分驻在柳潭里到下碣隅里二十余里的公路线上，兵力大过我们不知若干倍。但是在党坚强领导下的五连，却不顾一切，像一把尖刀似的一直插入敌人的心脏。当我们爬上一座大山时，见山下到处是美国强盗燃起来的熊熊大火，由南向北，一直向鸭绿江烧过去。战士们满怀着对敌人的愤怒，顾不得山高路险，天寒地冻，从山上滚了下来。荆棘刺破了人们的衣服，挂伤了人们的手、脸。拂晓时，我们已插到了大公路上。这是敌人南北交通的大动脉，北犯的敌人全部是沿着这条公路走的。我们刚一到达，迎面开来了一辆小吉普。“骨干模范”第五班一个跑步飞下山来，一阵机枪扫射之后，十余把亮晶晶的刺刀对准了车上五个美国鬼子的胸口。五班长范玉田同志用英语喊了两句宽待俘虏的话，五个美国鬼子连忙双膝跪倒，乖乖地当了俘虏。完成任务后，战士们消灭敌人的信心更加增强了。支委会及时召开了飞行集会，进行了鼓动。全连随即在紧靠敌陆战第一师师部驻地（下碣隅里）以北的山上，摆开兵力，割断了敌人的电线，反坦克组布置在公路上，队伍把好路口。至此敌人南北交通被我五连切断了。
    八点钟左右，公路上突然出现了两辆坦克和四辆满载敌兵的汽车。等敌人接近我们约百米左右时，我指挥所有武器一齐开火，立时炸毁了坦克，打翻了汽车，部队冲上前去。第一辆坦克上的驾驶兵刚露出半截身子，就被打死了。另一辆坦克上的一个家伙，慌得连外衣也没穿，两只手上不知为什么套着两只袜子，被我们生俘过来。其余敌人被我杀伤大部。我无伤亡。战士们的劲头更大了。但支部马上估计到，敌人两次被歼灭得这样容易，是因为出其不意，现在敌人已经感到我们像一把剑刺在它的心旁，它一定不会甘心。我们必须赶快准备。我命令重新调整了布署。战士们在山头上做起了坚强的工事。
    一刻钟以后，来了十几架飞机。接着是四辆坦克，掩护着二百余步兵，分数路向我阵地进攻。有两辆坦克冲到我阵地附近。模范党员三班副刘培三同志，带着两个战士向坦克扑去。在距坦克数公尺的地方，他举起炸弹准备向坦克投掷时，不幸被敌机枪击中，光荣地牺牲了。他投弹时，一只腿跪着，左手按地，牺牲以后尸体未倒，右手仍然高举着他那未投出的炸弹。他像英雄的塑像，矗立在敌人坦克前进的路上。后边的两辆坦克始终不敢前进一步。另一辆坦克想从一旁冲上我军的阵地。战前要求立功入党的巩振华同志，冒着坦克上数挺重机枪的扫射，站起身来，瞄准坦克的了望孔，打了一梭子机枪子弹，将敌驾驶员击毙。敌人的坦克就再也不动了。接着后边的两辆坦克也被炸毁。我二排随即连续数次出击，将敌人打退。由于敌人的增援，战士们来不及清查敌人死亡的数目字，便积极地准备再战了。
    更激烈的战斗开始了。敌人大概已经意识到它的即将被歼的命运，因而狠命地向我们阵地猛攻起来。二三十架飞机轮番轰炸，大炮连珠排射，山上的小松树被打光了，阵地弥漫在烟雾之中。白白的山头变成了黑的。在我们纵横两里路的阵地上，每两公尺便有一大的炮弹坑。鬼子们从四面八方，向我疯狂反击。五连全体同志艰苦奋战。
    战斗最激烈的时候，也就是党的工作最活跃的时候。
    指导员朱良玉同志穿梭一样地进出于火网之中，来回指挥作战。他根据情况变化和大家作战的情形，进行火线上的飞行鼓动，把“光荣证”当场交给作战有功的同志。不久，他被敌人的炮弹打中了，牺牲前高呼：“为祖国争光！不要忘记我们的仇恨和决心，为中朝人民报仇！共产党万岁！”他这种共产党员、优秀政治工作者的高贵品质和英勇行为，大大地鼓舞了部队的战斗情绪。二十一岁的共产党员、八班副崔胜昆马上跳出阵地，代替政治指导员进行鼓动与指挥部队。
    战斗异常激烈。
    战前一直表示要在战斗中入团的青年战士张金龙同志，一个人冲入敌群，被敌包围。他坚守在一个山凹里，敌人连续向他攻击，被他打死了两个。坚守到天黑，安全地返回阵地。晚上，他光荣地参加了青年团。
    战斗的第一天，我们打退了敌人大小二十三次冲锋。给敌人以极大的杀伤。当夜十时后，敌人再不敢攻击了。支部组织委员三排副李明坤同志和副连长马上召开支委会，调整了班排组织，将伤亡的支委小组长和各级行政干部提升补充起来。及时充实了支部的领导。
    以后连续六天战斗中，敌人每天都有攻击。因为第一天我给敌以迎头痛击，严重地挫败了敌人的凶焰，其攻击精神远不如第一天了。但飞机的轰炸和大炮的排射，却一天比一天加紧了。而零下三十度的奇寒，对战士们也是一个严重的考验。许多人冻坏了手、脚和脸。党员、干部带头，咬紧牙关坚持下去。支部组织委员李明坤同志的两脚冻烂了，但他毫不叫苦，跑上跑下地布置工作，并利用战斗间隙给战士们弄饭吃。炮火紧急时，党员、干部叫战士隐蔽起来，自己监视敌人。党员陈国治夜晚摸下山去，拣来了敌人十来条毯子，撕开给战士们将手脸包好，他又到山沟里找来些稻草，给同志们铺在工事里。
    在连续的战斗中，支部提出了“为指导员及牺牲的同志报仇”的口号，并发动各班讨论如何克服困难，争取做抗美援朝保家卫国的大功连队。在后几天中，敌人攻击次数较少，支部又及时提出了：“防止松懈麻痹，克服困难就是胜利。”召开支委扩大会，传达了上级党委对连里的表扬，及兄弟部队因五连阻住了下竭隅里敌人的增援而在柳潭里取得了大胜利的消息。党的小组会抓紧时间开会，表扬战斗模范，广泛地交流打仗的经验，研究打美国鬼子的办法。并以党员为核心，鼓舞大家随时作战斗的准备。
    在七昼夜的艰苦战斗中，党的支委会开了五次会议，始终保证了部队战斗情绪的高涨，战胜了困难，并以较小的代价杀伤敌人三百多名，有力地配合了我军歼灭长津湖一带万余敌人的战斗，圆满地完成了战斗任务。
    五连由于党的支部坚强领导和共产党员的模范作用，在这次战斗中，为祖国人民立下了大功。受到上级的通令嘉奖。在师的功臣大会上，五连有十八个二等功以上的功臣参加。我也以一个指挥员的身份被评为大功功臣和战斗英雄。我所以能够得到这个光荣的称号，完全是上级正确的指挥，和五连党的支部、全体共产党员、和全体同志努力的结果，是光荣牺牲的烈士们的不朽的功勋。在纪念党的三十周年的光辉的日子中，使我更加深深地感觉到我们党的伟大、光荣、正确。让我们高呼！
    伟大光荣正确的中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
