Eliminating pests is the most important combat task on the agricultural production front right now. Various pests have been occurring frequently recently, and if we do not step up pest control, it will inevitably affect this year's production increase plan. Leading agencies in various regions must pay close attention to this issue and further strengthen the leadership of pest control work in order to eradicate pests.

Since the beginning of summer, due to the dry climate, various pests have occurred widely in vast areas, among which locusts, cotton aphids, and rice borers are the most harmful. Locusts have occurred in more than 150 counties and cities in Anhui North, Jiangsu North, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Hebei, Pingyuan, Shanxi, Xinjiang and other provinces, with a spread area of more than 2.8 million mu. Among them, Sihong in Anhui North and Huanghua in Hebei are the most serious. After the local people's government organized the masses to capture and kill them, and the People's Air Force assisted in spraying and killing them, they have now been basically wiped out. However, locusts that escaped the net have re-aggregated into small groups and moved to the fields, eating seedlings. In some areas, millet, sorghum, corn, etc. have been eaten bare; at present, most of these locusts have molted and taken off, making capture more difficult; in some areas, new locusts are still emerging. Cotton aphids occurred widely in all cotton-producing areas across the country in June. In Hebei Province, 30% of cotton fields have aphids, and in severely affected areas, cotton leaves are curled up to 26%; they have spread to more than 20 counties in Pingyuan Province, and in Shandong Province, 14 counties in Dezhou Prefecture alone; cotton aphids have also been found in Henan, Shaanxi, Jiangsu North, Anhui North, and various cotton-producing areas in the Southwest. Cotton red spiders have also been found in some areas, with Huimin in Shandong and Pinggu in Hebei being the most numerous, and there have been phenomena of leaf curling and destroying other crops. Rice borers are one of the main pests in Jiangnan. Various regions have paid attention to pest control in the spring, especially Zhejiang, Fujian, and Hunan provinces, which have achieved the greatest results. However, rice borers have not been eradicated in the vast areas south of the Yangtze River, and the second generation of rice moths is currently occurring in large numbers, which is the most harmful stage. Other pests such as rice leaf rollers, leafhoppers, crickets, armyworms, leaf rollers, millet stem borers, tobacco aphids, and tobacco budworms have also begun to be found in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Jiangsu North, Anhui North, Shandong, Hebei, Chahar, Northeast and other places, among which the stem borer in Chahar is the most common, and 15,000 mu of millet seedlings have been destroyed.

As mentioned above, now that it is the fastest season for pest breeding, and the threat to agricultural production is still very serious, we must actively work hard to quickly eliminate them.

Strengthening the leadership of pest control work is a prerequisite for overcoming pests. Pest-affected areas must establish pest control command organizations at all levels, and at the same time, the following four ideological problems must be resolved.

First, we must break the pessimistic and despairing thinking. Some people appear at a loss in the face of the rampant pests; some people have already felt tired after the pests have been repeatedly killed and re-emerged. This emotion is very dangerous. Leading agencies in various regions should immediately give spiritual encouragement and technical assistance to places where the emotions of failure have begun to sprout, in order to strengthen the confidence of cadres and the masses in pest control, and to make them know that as long as they are good at mobilizing and organizing the masses, inspiring their enthusiasm for pest control struggles, and fighting pests repeatedly and stubbornly, then no pests cannot be overcome. For example, wheat midges were difficult to control last year, but this year farmers in Henan, Hubei and other places created various simple pest control methods and achieved great results. This example eloquently illustrates the great wisdom and power of the peasant masses in overcoming natural disasters. As long as we are good at inspiring and organizing the masses, we can achieve victory in the fight against various pests.

Second, we must oppose complacency and reliance. Some areas have not suffered from pests for many years, so the cadres and farmers there have developed serious complacency and are indifferent to the work of preventing pests. Some farmers in some areas have narrow regional concepts, thinking that locusts will fly to other places when they grow up, and capturing them will trample on their own crops. In some newly liberated areas where pest control work has no foundation, there is still a serious superstitious idea that these pests are "born and destroyed by heaven" and that "there is surplus grain in the mouths of insects" and there is no need to capture them. Some people say, "Aphids don't need to be treated, rain will solve the problem." Therefore, they are specifically waiting for rain. In some areas where cotton insurance has been implemented, some cadres have the idea that "cotton has already been insured, why bother to treat aphids." All these ideas are wrong. If there is insufficient understanding of the harmfulness of pests and no necessary measures are taken, once pests occur, it will inevitably lead to panic. If pests have already occurred and you don't work hard yourself, but only rely on heaven to control pests, the so-called "born and destroyed by heaven", there is no way not to fail. As for the People's Insurance Company's promotion of cotton insurance, the purpose is to provide cotton farmers with living security when they encounter irresistible natural disasters and suffer reduced harvests, in order to increase cotton farmers' enthusiasm for production, and it should not be that they do not fight pests because of this.

Third, we must resolutely implement the pest control policy of mainly manual capture and supplemented by medicines and machines. At present, our production of medicines and machines cannot keep up with the needs of pest control. Therefore, the idea of relying solely on medicines and machines to control pests will inevitably delay the timing of pest control and lead to serious losses. At present, aircraft locust control can only be tried in severely affected areas, and even hand-cranked powder sprayers and locust control agents are not sufficient; medicines and machines for controlling other pests are also insufficient. All regions must grasp the policy of mainly manual capture and supplemented by medicines and machines, and immediately mobilize the masses to capture them once pests are found; at the same time, for certain pests, local materials should be used as much as possible to prepare local medicines for elimination and treatment, and there should be no waiting and watching, missing the timing of pest control.

Fourth, we must break the "no manpower" and "no time" emotion of helplessness. Because the capture of pests requires a lot of manpower, and at present, pest control work and other agricultural work such as cultivating, weeding, watering, and topdressing have conflicts in terms of manpower and time, many cadres in pest-affected areas feel helpless. In fact, there are solutions, but we need to be responsible and use our brains to think about them. For example, in order to solve the manpower problem, we should mobilize a large number of women and children to participate in pest control work. Rural women in Daming County, Hebei Province, once proposed the slogan "Men cultivate and water, women take care of pest control," and a large number of women poured into the aphid eradication movement, thus solving the difficulty of insufficient labor and enabling the county's cotton fields to be universally treated with cotton aphids once, and some have been treated two to three times, achieving great results. The people's governments in various severely pest-affected areas should pay attention to solving these contradictions in the arrangement of rural work and the use of force. In severely pest-affected areas, pest control work should be listed as the most urgent task.

Grain and industrial raw materials are major national affairs, and we should resolutely fight pests in order to strive for a continued bumper harvest this year.

### 消灭虫害，争取丰收

　　消灭虫害，争取丰收
    除治害虫，是当前农业生产战线上最主要的战斗任务。近来各种虫害不断发生，如不加紧除治，必将影响今年的增产计划。各地领导机关对这一问题必须严密注意，进一步加强治虫工作的领导，以求扑灭虫害。
    入夏以来，由于气候干燥，各种虫害在广大地区普遍发生，其中以蝗蝻、棉蚜和稻螟为害最大。蝗蝻在皖北、苏北、山东、河南、湖北、河北、平原、山西、新疆等省区的一百五十余县市发生，蔓延面积达二百八十余万亩。其中以皖北泗洪和河北黄骅两县最为严重。经当地人民政府组织群众捕打，以及人民空军协助喷杀之后，现已基本扑灭。但漏网蝗蝻又复聚成小群转移田间，吃害禾苗，个别地区，谷子、高粱、玉米等有的已被吃秃；目前这些蝗蝻已大部羽化起飞，捕打更加困难；有些地区，新蝗尚在继续出土。棉花蚜虫，在六月间，已在全国各产棉区普遍发生，河北全省有百分之三十的棉田发生蚜虫，虫害严重地区，棉叶卷缩达百分之二十六；平原省已蔓延二十余县，山东省仅德州专区即有十四县，河南、陕西、苏北、皖北及西南各产棉区也均已发现棉蚜。棉花红蜘蛛，在部分地区中，也已有发现，以山东惠民和河北平谷最多，已有卷叶和毁种其他作物的现象。水稻螟虫是江南主要虫害之一，各地在春季即已注意除治，特别是浙江、福建、湖南三省所获成绩最大。但在长江以南广大地区内，螟虫仍未根绝，而且目前正是第二代螟蛾大量发生，为害最烈的阶段。其他如稻苞虫、浮尘子、蟋蟀、行军虫、卷叶虫、谷子钻心虫、烟蚜、烟青虫等也在湖南、湖北、江西、苏北、皖北、山东、河北、察哈尔、东北等地开始发现，其中以察哈尔的钻心虫最普遍，已有一万五千亩谷苗被毁。
    如上所述，目前既然是害虫繁殖最速季节，对于农业生产的威胁，既然仍是十分严重，我们就必须积极努力，迅速加以扑灭。
    加强治虫工作的领导，是战胜虫害的先决条件。虫害地区必须建立各级灭虫指挥组织，同时还必须解决以下四个思想上的问题。
    第一，必须打破悲观失望的思想。有些人在丛生的各种虫害面前，表现手足无措；有些人在虫害屡打屡生的情况下，已经感觉疲倦，这种情绪是很危险的。各地领导机关对于失败情绪已见萌芽的地方，应即给以精神上的鼓励和技术上的帮助，以坚定干部和群众治虫的信心，要使他们知道，只要善于发动和组织群众，启发其治虫斗争的积极性，反复不断地顽强地对虫害进行斗争，那就没有任何虫害不可能被战胜的。例如，小麦吸浆虫去年曾苦于无法除治，今年河南湖北等地农民创造了各种简易捕虫办法，获得了很大成效。这一事例，雄辩地说明了农民群众克服自然灾害的伟大的智慧和力量，只要我们善于启发和组织群众，即能取得和各种虫害斗争的胜利。
    第二，必须反对麻痹大意和依赖的思想。有些地区多年未受虫害，因而那里的干部和农民便产生了严重的麻痹思想，对防止虫害的工作漠不关心。有些地区部分农民存在着狭隘的地域观念，以为蝗蝻长大就会飞往外地，进行捕打反会践踏自己庄稼。在治虫工作没有基础的有些新解放区，还严重地存在着迷信思想，认为这些害虫是“天生天灭”，“虫子嘴里有余粮”，不必进行捕打。有些人则说，“蚜虫不用治，下雨就了事。”因而他们专门等待下雨。在有些实行了棉花保险的地区，部分干部产生了“棉花已经保险，何必再治蚜虫”的思想。所有这些思想，都是错误的。对于虫害的危害性认识不足，不采取必要的措施，一旦虫害发生，必致手忙脚乱。已经发生虫害，自己又不努力，只是靠天治虫，所谓“天生天灭”，也没有不失败的。至于人民保险公司推行棉花保险，目的在于使棉农遇到不可抗拒的自然灾害因而歉收时，能得到生活上的保障，以提高棉农生产的积极性，不能因此反而不同虫害作斗争。
    第三，必须坚决贯彻以人力捕打为主药械为辅的治虫方针。目前我们的药械生产还赶不上治虫的需要。因此，单纯依靠药械治虫的思想，必将贻误治虫时机，招致严重损失。目前飞机灭蝗还只能在严重地区试办，即手摇喷粉器和灭蝗药剂也不够充分；除治其他害虫的药械，也不敷应用。各地必须掌握以人工捕打为主，药械为辅的方针，一经发现虫害立即发动群众进行捕打；同时对某些虫害，并应尽量就地取材配制土药，予以除治，绝不应等待观望，错过治虫时机。
    第四，必须打破“没有人力”“没有时间”的无办法情绪。由于捕打害虫需用人力很大，而目前治虫工作与其他农事工作如中耕、锄苗、浇水、追肥等在人力上和时间上又发生了矛盾，因此虫害地区的许多干部感觉没有办法。其实办法是有的，但是要我们负责任动脑筋去想。例如为了解决人力问题，就应当大量动员妇女儿童参加治虫工作。河北省大名县农村妇女曾提出“男子锄苗浇水，妇女包治虫害”的口号，大批妇女涌入了灭蚜运动，因而解决了劳力不足的困难，使全县棉田已普遍除治了一次棉蚜，有的已治了两遍到三遍，取得很大成绩。各虫害严重地区的人民政府在农村工作的安排上和力量的使用上应注意解决这些矛盾。在虫害严重的地区，应将治虫工作列为最紧急的任务。
    粮食和工业原料是国家的大事，我们应当坚决地和虫害作斗争，以争取今年继续丰收。
