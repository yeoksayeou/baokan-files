Respected Chairman Mao:

I have lived for forty-one years. In the old society, I labored for twenty-six years; but in these twenty-six years, I didn't have a single day of good life. The Communist Party came, and my life changed. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, I have lived three and a half years of happy and blessed life. Moreover, since the year before last, I have been a glorious Communist Party member. Commemorating the thirtieth anniversary of the Party, and thinking about my life for the past half-century, how grateful I am to the Party and Chairman Mao!

The painful life of the past twenty-six years is endless to talk about. I started herding pigs for landlords at the age of twelve, then became a "half-laborer," and when I grew up, I carried heavy loads, enduring hunger and starvation for eighteen years. From the age of thirty to thirty-eight, I worked as a worker for eight years. During the puppet Manchukuo period, I worked twelve to eighteen hours a day, and the wages I earned were not enough to eat or wear. My clothes were patched and patched again, and when they couldn't be patched anymore, I tied them with ropes. The small dark room I lived in was narrow and small. When the Kuomintang bandits came, it was the same, forcing workers to work and using beatings and scoldings instead of wages. The Kuomintang bandits were in Jilin for twenty-two months, and I almost starved to death.

In the spring of 1948, I was thirty-eight years old. This was a real spring. The Communist Party came to Jilin City, and Chairman Mao's brilliance shone on Jilin City, bringing me warmth and strength. As soon as the People's Government came, it distributed millet to the workers. After eating my fill, I thought: I must treat our workers' Party and the People's Government with sincerity. On the third day of the liberation of Jilin City, I went to the factory to sign up for work. In fact, the factory did not exist at that time. All there was, was a ruin. I accepted the task given to me by the leadership and took on the responsibility of restoring the factory. We overcame the difficulties of lack of materials and the difficulties in technology. Everyone used their hands and minds to restore the factory. Under the Party's cultivation and education, I realized my position as the master of my country, and I realized that the Communist Party is the working class's own political party. I had the ideal of building a communist society in the future. In June 1949, I joined the Party. Since then, I have been working even harder. I am wholeheartedly committed to improving production. If there are difficulties, I will overcome them with everyone; if the technology is not enough, I will study; if I don't have culture, I will study. More importantly, I must improve myself politically and make my class consciousness higher. The year before last, I was elected as a model in the factory, last year I was elected as a model in the city, a provincial labor model, and I also participated in the National Congress of Labor Models, Peasants, and Soldiers. In Beijing, I met Chairman Mao. When I listened to Chairman Mao's speech, when I ate with Chairman Mao, I had a lot to say, but I didn't say anything. I just said to myself in my heart: I have to do better, and make more contributions to repay the Party and Chairman Mao.

Now, the production in our factory has improved, and our lives have also improved greatly. We have implemented labor insurance, our children are going to school, and the factory has built nursing homes and clubs. Our food, clothing, and housing are completely different from the past. This good life was brought by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. I became a model and improved my literacy (in the past three years, I have learned more than a thousand characters and can read newspapers and write letters). Since May of this year, I have been the deputy director of the workshop. Now I am also a member of the Jilin Provincial People's Government. This is the result of the Party and Chairman Mao's cultivation and education. The Party and Chairman Mao have given me happiness and glory. In order to resist America and aid Korea and defend our country; in order to create a happier life under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party, I am determined to further increase production and respond to the call of the General Association to Resist America and Aid Korea to donate planes and cannons to support the front lines. Now, we have formulated a patriotic pact and a long-term donation plan. I promise to do the following tasks as a gift to the Party and Chairman Mao:

\tFirst, improve quality and ensure that first-class products account for more than 70%.
\tSecond, respond to the call of the General Association to Resist America and Aid Korea, and complete the donation plan by exceeding production targets and improving quality.
\tThird, raise vigilance, do a good job in four preventions (anti-spy, fire prevention, air defense, anti-theft), and assist the government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries.
\tFourth, unite technical personnel and learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union.

\t\t\t\t\tRespectfully,
\t\t\t\t\tWang Yazhou

### 党使我这个苦工人成为省政府委员  ——工业劳动模范王亚洲给毛主席的信

　　党使我这个苦工人成为省政府委员
    ——工业劳动模范王亚洲给毛主席的信敬爱的毛主席：
    我活了四十一岁。在旧社会里，我劳动了二十六年；可是在这二十六年里，我没有过一天好生活。共产党来了，我的生活改变了。在共产党和毛主席的领导下，我过了三年半快乐、幸福的生活了。而且，从前年起，我是一个光荣的共产党员了。纪念党的三十周年时，想想我这半辈子生活，我是多么感激党和毛主席啊！
    过去那二十六年的痛苦的生活，是说不完的。我从十二岁起就给地主放猪，后来当“半拉子”，长大了又扛活，忍饥挨饿干了十八年。从三十岁到三十八岁，我作了八年工人。伪满的时候，一天做十二个钟头到十八个钟头，挣的工钱不够吃不够穿。衣服破的补了又补，补不住了用绳子拴上。住的小黑屋子又狭又小。国民党匪帮来了也是一个样，强迫工人干活，用打骂来代替工钱。国民党匪帮在吉林二十二个月，我差点没饿死。
    一九四八年春天，我三十八岁。这是个真正的春天，共产党来到了吉林市，毛主席的光辉照到了吉林市，给我带来了温暖和力量。人民政府一来，就发给工人小米。吃了饱饭，我想：我得拿出真心来对待咱们工人的党和人民政府。吉林市解放第三天，我就到工厂去报名上工。实际上，当时工厂是不存在的。有的只是一片废墟。我接受领导上给我的任务，把恢复工厂的责任承担起来。我们克服材料缺乏的困难，克服技术上的困难，大家用手和头脑把工厂恢复起来了。在党的培养教育下，我认识到自己的国家主人翁地位，认识到共产党是工人阶级自己的政党，我有了为将来建设共产主义社会的理想。一九四九年六月，我参加了党。从那以后，我干的更起劲了。我一心一意要把生产搞好。有困难，和大家一块儿去克服；技术不够，我学习；没有文化，我学习。更重要的是在政治上提高自己，使自己阶级觉悟更高。前年我被选为工厂里的模范，去年被选为市的模范，省的劳动模范，又参加了全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议。在北京，我见了毛主席。我听毛主席讲话的时候，我和毛主席在一起吃饭的时候，我有很多话想说，可是什么也没说出来。我只是在心里对自己说：还要干得更好，拿更多的贡献，来报答党和毛主席。
    现在，我们工厂的生产提高了，我们的生活也大大改善了。我们实行了劳动保险，我们的子弟上学了，工厂里又修了养老院、俱乐部，我们的吃、穿、住跟过去都完全不同了。这好生活是共产党、毛主席带来的。我当了模范，提高了文化（三年来我已经认一千多字，能看报写信），从今年五月我做了车间副主任。我现在又是吉林省人民政府委员。这都是党和毛主席培养教育的结果。党和毛主席，给了我幸福和光荣。为了抗美援朝，保卫我们的国家；为了在毛主席和党的领导下，创造更幸福的生活，我决心进一步提高生产，响应抗美援朝总会的号召，捐献飞机大炮支援前线。现在，我们已经订出来爱国公约和长期的捐献计划。我保证做好下面几项工作，作为给党和毛主席的献礼：
    第一、提高质量，保证一等品占百分之七十以上。
    第二、响应抗美援朝总会号召，用超过生产任务，提高质量完成捐献计划。
    第三、提高警惕，做好四防（防特、防火、防空、防盗）工作，协助政府镇压反革命。
    第四、团结技术人员，学习苏联的先进经验。
              王亚洲  敬上
