Xinhua News Agency, Paris, July 27th: Since the French elections, the French reactionaries have been unable to piece together a government that can obtain a majority of 314 votes in the 627-member National Assembly.

Since July 12th, the French President has successively invited former Prime Minister Queuille, former Minister of Finance Petsche, the Popular Republican Movement's Schuman, the Radical Socialist Party's Mayer, the Popular Republican Movement's Bidault, and Reynaud, the French "surrender prime minister" during World War II, to form a cabinet.

However, Queuille, Schuman, Bidault, and Reynaud dared not accept the task. Although Petsche and Mayer attempted to win over various reactionary parties to cobble together a "Third Force" cabinet, they both failed. After five days of activity, when Mayer requested the National Assembly's approval to form a cabinet, the National Assembly, after all-night debate, still expressed no confidence in Mayer on the morning of the 25th with 241 votes against 105. Mayer's vote count was 73 votes short of the absolute majority required by the constitution.

Auriol is preparing to convene a meeting of the leaders of all French political parties in an attempt to resolve this cabinet crisis. The fundamental reason for this French cabinet crisis is the growing strong anti-fascist sentiment among the French people, which makes the right-wing Socialist Party, the Popular Republican Movement, the Radical Socialist Party, and other so-called "Third Force" parties hesitant to collude with the fascist de Gaulle party (which occupies the most seats in the anti-communist parliament). Furthermore, the "Third Force" parties themselves are at odds, filled with contradictions. The right-wing *Combat* newspaper admitted that "everyone expects the crisis to continue for a long time."

### 法国反动派拼凑不出新内阁  人民反法西斯情绪日益增长

　　法国反动派拼凑不出新内阁
　  人民反法西斯情绪日益增长
    【新华社二十七日讯】巴黎消息：法国大选以后，法国反动派到现在为止始终拼凑不出一个能在六百二十七个议员的国民议会中获得三百一十四票过半数支持的政府来。
    自本月十二日起，法国总统先后请原内阁总理葛义，原内阁财政部长比许，人民共和党人舒曼，激进社会党人迈耶，人民共和党人皮杜尔，第二次大战时的法国“投降总理”雷诺等人组阁。
    但是，葛义、舒曼、皮杜尔和雷诺都不敢应命，比许和迈耶虽也曾企图拉拢各反动党派拼凑个“第三种力量”的内阁，但都失败了。迈耶在活动了五天之后请求国民议会批准他组阁时，国民议会经彻夜辩论后，还是在二十五日清晨以二百四十一票对一百零五票表示对迈耶不信任。迈耶所得的票数，距宪法规定的绝对多数票少了七十三票。
    阿里奥尔正拟召集法国一切政党领袖会议，企图解决这个内阁危机。这次法国内阁危机的根本原因是法国人民中增长着强烈的反法西斯情绪，使右翼社会党、人民共和党、激进社会党等所谓“第三种力量”不敢贸然与法西斯的戴高乐党（反共议会中占最多席位）勾结，而“第三种力量”各党派间也同床异梦，充满着矛盾。右派的《战斗报》承认，“大家预料危机将继续一个长时期”。
