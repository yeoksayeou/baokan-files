Regarding the issue of lending public funds to private individuals

Self-criticism letter from the manager of Shijiazhuang Department Store

To the Editorial Department:

After reading the article "The Manager of Shijiazhuang Department Store Should Not Randomly Lend Public Funds to Private Individuals" in the People's Daily's June 22nd Reader's Letters column, I offer the following self-criticism:

(1) In January of this year, the deputy section chief of the Planning Section requested a loan of three million yuan, stating it was for urgent use. I approved the loan, and it was repaid within twenty days. The deputy section chief of the Accounting Section also borrowed 1.5 million yuan of public funds for purchasing land for his family, repaying 600,000 yuan within a month and the entire amount within two months. Some comrades raised objections at meetings, but at the time, I considered this to be "taking care of the cadres' emotions" and not a major issue. I did not seriously consider accepting the criticism. Later, after the higher-level Party Committee discovered this, pointed out my error, and asked me to make a profound self-criticism, I have now realized the error I committed. In handling this issue, I did not proceed from the interests of the country and the people, but emphasized so-called "taking care of the cadres' emotions," lending a huge amount of public funds to private individuals, violating the cash management system, and damaging the use of state funds. The main reason for committing this error is insufficient political training, a very poor understanding of policies, and bad habits of acting like a guerrilla and being overly sentimental. At the same time, the fault also lies with my petty-bourgeois heroic tendencies, failing to accept comrades' criticisms and correct my errors in a timely manner, which further exacerbated the severity of the problem and hindered my progress.

(2) Regarding the issue of approving welfare funds for sick cadres, although I obtained the consent of the trade union committee at the time, it was not discussed by the group. This is because I had insufficient knowledge of the Trade Union Law and did not handle the matter in accordance with regulations, treating the matter hastily.

In the future, I must strengthen my study of theory and policies, improve myself, unite the cadres politically, overcome the tendency to act solely on emotion without principle, correct my guerrilla-style work habits, strengthen discipline, adhere to and improve various formal systems, and improve my work.

### 关于以公款借给私人的问题  石家庄百货公司经理来信检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　关于以公款借给私人的问题
　  石家庄百货公司经理来信检讨编辑同志：
    读了人民日报六月二十二日读者来信栏《石家庄百货公司经理不应随便借公款给私人》一稿，我作如下检讨：
    （一）今年一月份，计划科副科长提出借款三百万元，说有急用，我即批准借给，二十天内归还了。会计科副科长因家购地亦借了公款一百五十万元，一个月内还六十万元，两个月内全部还清。在会议上有的同志提出意见，我当时还认为这是“照顾干部情绪”，不是什么大问题，未很好地考虑接受批评，后经上级党委发觉，指出错误，让我作深刻检讨。今天我已认识到我所犯的错误。我处理这个问题，不从国家人民利益出发，强调所谓“照顾干部情绪”，把巨额公款借与私人，违犯现金管理制度，使国家资金的使用受到损害。犯错误主要原因是由于政治锻炼不够，对政策学习很差，有游击习气和感情用事的不良作风。同时，由于个人小资产阶级的英雄主义思想作怪，未能接受同志的批评及时改正错误，更加重了问题的严重性，障碍了自己的进步。
    （二）干部有病批准福利金问题，虽在当时征得工会委员同意，而未经小组研究，这是由于对工会法学习不够，未按规定办事，草率地处理了问题。
    我今后必须加强理论政策的学习，提高自己，从政治上团结干部，克服单纯从感情出发的无原则倾向，纠正游击作风，加强纪律性，坚持与健全各种正规制度，改进工作。
