　  Prepares to Convene the First North China County Magistrate Conference
　  To Discuss Democratic Governance and Inspect Commendation Work
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Central People's Government North China Affairs Department is currently preparing to convene the first North China County Magistrate Conference in mid-September. In recent years, North China's political power construction has achieved great success. Except for Suiyuan, the entire region is an old liberated area. Bandits have been eradicated, land reform has been completed, and the masses have been generally organized. All 332 counties, general medium-sized cities, and leagues and banners in the region have universally held people's representative conferences. Among them, people's representative conferences in ten counties have exercised the functions and powers of county people's congresses, and two-thirds of the counties have convened people's representative conferences of all sectors more than five times. Especially since the launch of the Resist America and Aid Korea and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movements, many regions have strongly organized and promoted various important tasks through people's representative conferences, enhanced the people's political enthusiasm, and further consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship. This shows that the vast majority of areas in North China have sufficient conditions and urgently need to implement a people's democratic political power system with the People's Congress or people's representative conferences of all sectors exercising the functions and powers of the People's Congress. However, in fact, very few places have done this. Many places that have convened people's representative conferences of all sectors many times still have many shortcomings. For example, the due functions and roles of the people's representative conferences are confused with ordinary cadre meetings, simply arranging work, and adopting an insufficiently serious and responsible attitude towards the proposals and requests of the people and their representatives. The residual influence of bourgeois "democratic" forms and the leadership's paternalism, closed-doorism, and undemocratic work styles still exist to a considerable extent. At the same time, some regions and some responsible comrades do not care about politics, neglect overall leadership, and objectively weaken the work of political power construction; all of these are not in line with the current situation in North China.
    From the people's perspective, the economic life of the people in North China has undergone great changes. Urban (including small and medium-sized cities) industry has generally recovered and has developed considerably. Agriculture and household handicraft industry have generally reached the production level before the Anti-Japanese War. Economic development inevitably leads to an increasing demand for political participation by the people. Especially after the Resist America and Aid Korea and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movements, the people's political enthusiasm has been unprecedentedly heightened. They have experienced the superiority of the people's democratic dictatorship in actual struggles. Therefore, the broad masses of the people will inevitably demand to further strengthen the work of political power, so as to enhance the great unity of the people of all revolutionary classes and consolidate the victorious fruits of revolutionary struggle and the three major movements. That is to say, the people demand to strengthen democratic political life and strengthen the organizational form of exercising state power—the People's Representative Conference system. These are the greatest demands of the people in North China at present. Failing to meet the people's demands is to go against the will of the people.
    Based on the above situation and requirements, the Central People's Government North China Affairs Department plans to convene the first North China County Magistrate Conference in mid-September. In addition to county magistrates or deputy county magistrates from each county, commissioners or deputy commissioners from various regions, provincial chairmen or vice chairmen, and relevant cadres from large and medium-sized municipal governments will also attend. The central task of the conference is to further consolidate and develop the people's democratic dictatorship, promote and improve the county-level People's Representative Conference system, consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front, and strengthen the political leadership and core leadership of governments at all levels. The conference will also provide a brief report and discussion on the situation and future tasks in North China. At the same time, the conference will also conduct a thorough inspection and deployment of commendation work.
    The above conference plan has been approved by the State Council of the Central People's Government. Relevant departments of the Central Government, including the State Council, the Political and Legal Committee of the State Council, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, have each sent responsible cadres to assist the North China Affairs Department in forming the "Preparatory Committee for the First North China County Magistrate Conference." Tao Xijin, Deputy Minister of the North China Affairs Department, serves as the chairman of the committee, and Wu Xinyu, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and Bai Jian, Director of the General Office of the North China Affairs Department, serve as the vice chairmen.
    In order to fully prepare for the conference ideologically, the North China Affairs Department has printed and distributed important instructions and documents related to political power construction by Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Liu, and the State Council, instructing cadres above the county magistrate level to organize reading. At the same time, in order to deeply understand the situation, under the leadership of the Preparatory Committee, an inspection team including cadres from the above-mentioned relevant departments was organized; and Lou Bangyan, professor of the Department of Political Science of Peking University, lecturers Zhu Qiwu, Rui Bing, professor of the Department of Law, assistant Li Youyi; Zeng Bingjun, director of the Department of Political Science of Tsinghua University, professors Zhao Dejie and Yu Zhenpeng; Chen Fangzhi, director of the Department of Political Science of Yenching University, associate professor Zhang Xitong, and lecturer Wang Qingyuan and other people participated in the inspection. At 9:00 a.m. on July 4, the inspection team held a symposium to discuss the preparatory work and inspection plan for the conference. Dong Biwu, Vice Premier of the State Council, Liu Lantao, Minister of the North China Affairs Department, Tao Xijin, Deputy Minister, and Wu Xinyu, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, were invited to attend. At the meeting, Vice Premier Dong clearly pointed out that the current political power construction should focus on the county level, and the People's Representative Conference of all circles in the county must be well held; the vast majority of areas in North China should also exercise the functions and powers of the County People's Congress on behalf of the conference, so that the representative conference truly becomes the basic system for the people to exercise state power. If the People's Representative Conference at the county level is well held, it will further provide conditions for strengthening the construction of district and village political power from the leadership. In addition, Vice Premier Dong, Minister Liu Lantao and other responsible comrades gave detailed instructions on the election of people's representatives, the leadership ideology, and the tasks and methods of this inspection. All participants engaged in a lively discussion. The day after the meeting ended, the team split up and went to Hebei, Shanxi, and Chahar to conduct inspections, and are expected to return to Beijing in early August.

　　中央人民政府华北事务部
　  筹备召开华北首次县长会议
　  讨论民主建政问题并检查优抚工作
    【本报讯】中央人民政府华北事务部现正筹备于九月中旬召开华北首次县长会议。近年来华北政权建设获得很大成绩。全区除绥远外均为老解放区，土匪已告肃清，土地改革已经完成，群众已普遍地组织起来。全区三百三十二个县、一般中等城市及各盟、旗，普遍地开过各界人民代表会议，其中有十个县人民代表会议代行了县人民代表大会职权，有三分之二的县均召开过五次以上的各界人民代表会议。特别是在开展抗美援朝和镇压反革命运动以来，不少地区通过人民代表会议，强有力地组织与推动了各项重要工作，提高了人民的政治积极性，进一步巩固了人民民主专政。这就说明了华北绝大部分地区已有充分的条件、并且迫切需要实行人民代表大会或由各界人民代表会议代行人民代表大会职权的人民民主政权制度。但是，事实上这样做了的地方，还是很少的。许多虽已召开过多次各界人民代表会议的地方，尚存在着很多缺点。如将人民代表会议应有的职权和作用与普通干部会议相混淆，单纯布置工作，对人民群众和人民代表的提案和要求，采取不够严肃负责的态度。资产阶级“民主”形式的残余影响和领导上包办代替，关门主义，不民主的作风还相当严重地存在着。同时有些地区、有些负责同志不关心政治，忽视全面领导，客观上亦削弱了政权建设工作；而这些都与华北当前的形势不相适应。
    就人民方面来说，目前华北人民的经济生活已有很大改变，城市（包括中小城市）工业一般的已经恢复并有相当发展，农业、家庭手工业一般的已达到抗日战争以前的生产水平。经济的发展必然地引起人民的政治要求日益增高，特别是经过抗美援朝、镇压反革命运动之后，人民的政治情绪空前的提高了，他们在实际斗争中体验了人民民主专政的优越性，因而，广大人民必然要求进一步地加强政权工作，借以增强各革命阶级人民的大团结，巩固革命斗争与三大运动的胜利果实。这就是说人民要求加强民主的政治生活，加强行使国家政权的组织形式——人民代表会议制度。这些就是华北人民当前的最大要求，不满足人民的这种要求，就是违背人民的意志。
    基于上述情况和要求，中央人民政府华北事务部拟于九月中旬召开华北第一次县长会议。除各县县长或副县长将参加会议外，各地专员或副专员，省主席或副主席及大中城市市府有关干部亦将出席参加。会议的中心任务，在于进一步地巩固与发展人民民主专政，推进与健全县级人民代表会议制度，巩固与扩大人民民主统一战线，加强各级政府的政治领导与核心领导。会议对华北的形势与今后任务，并将概要地举行报告与讨论。同时会议对优抚工作，亦将切实予以检查和布置。
    上述会议计划，已获中央人民政府政务院批准。中央各有关部门，包括中央人民政府政务院、政务院政治法律委员会、内务部及中共中央华北局，已各派负责干部，协助华北事务部组成了“华北首次县长会议筹备委员会”，华北事务部陶希晋副部长任主任委员，内务部武新宇副部长及华北事务部办公厅白坚主任任副主任委员。
    为了使会议在思想上有充分准备，华北事务部已印发了毛主席、刘副主席及政务院有关建政工作的重要指示和文件，责成县长以上干部组织阅读。同时为了深入地了解情况，在筹委会领导下，组织了包括上述各有关部门干部参加的视察组；同时吸收了北京大学政治系教授楼邦彦、讲师朱奇武，法律系教授芮冰、助教李友义；清华大学政治系主任曾炳钧、教授赵德洁和于振鹏；燕京大学政治系主任陈芳芝、副教授张锡彤、讲师王庆源等人参加视察。七月四日上午九时该视察组举行座谈会，讨论会议准备工作和视察计划，政务院董必武副总理，华北事务部刘澜涛部长、陶希晋副部长，及内务部武新宇副部长应邀出席。会上董副总理明确指出目前政权建设应以县为重点，必须开好县各界人民代表会议；华北绝大部分地区并应代行县人民代表大会职权，使代表会议真正成为人民行使国家政权的基本制度。把县一级的人民代表会议开好了，也就是为加强区村政权建设从领导上进一步地具备了条件。此外关于人民代表的选举问题，领导思想问题，以及此次视察的任务与方法问题，董副总理、刘澜涛部长及其他负责同志均有详细指示，全体与会人员展开了热烈讨论。会议结束的次日，该组即分赴河北、山西、察哈尔各地从事视察，预计八月初返京。
