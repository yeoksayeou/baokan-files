How Should Counter-Revolutionary Elements Be Controlled in Rural Areas?
Zhang Jingmin

Strengthening the control of counter-revolutionary elements is an important and very complex task in suppressing counter-revolution. At present, there are some problems and deviations in the control work in the rural areas of Anyang Prefecture, Pingyuan Province, which deserve attention and improvement.

The main problem currently existing in the control work is the lack of policy thinking in determining the targets of control, and the failure to clearly distinguish between the enemy and ourselves. That is to say, some rural cadres still do not understand who should be controlled and who should not be controlled. In many villages, the counter-revolutionary elements to be controlled are simply decided upon by a few cadres after a simple discussion. According to investigations, many villages have placed former puppet soldiers, former puppet officials, hooligans, lazy people, and some middle peasants who say backward things under control. In Xinzhen Village, Junxian County, with less than 300 households, 96 households were under control. In Xiaozhuang Village, Tangyin County, two middle peasants quarreled and fought over the use of a pulley; the village cadres, fearing that they would retaliate against each other by burning wheat, put them under control. Because village cadres were hasty in determining the targets of control, even abusing their power for personal gain, they expanded the scope of control, confused their own ranks, and lost the effectiveness of the control.

The control methods also urgently need to be improved. Many villages do not mobilize the masses to control bad elements, but limit it to public security personnel and a few village cadres. The main reason for this phenomenon is that the village cadres do not yet recognize that control work is a means of dictatorship by the people against the enemy, and that the purpose of control is to continue to attack and disintegrate the enemy, and consolidate the victory of suppressing counter-revolution. Instead of mobilizing the masses to control counter-revolutionary elements, they simply use administrative power. Therefore, in some villages, the masses do not know who is being controlled in the village and why they are being controlled. The controlled elements only report their activities to the village cadres every day. Individual bad elements take this opportunity to deliberately make things difficult for the cadres, reporting every little move they make; over time, not only are the counter-revolutionary elements not well controlled, but the village cadres are burdened with a “package.” Some villages have changed the oral reports of the controlled elements to written reports. However, control is relaxed during the busy farming season. For example, the controlled elements in Zhangxizhuang Village, Junxian County, said to the village cadres: “Now we are busy harvesting wheat, it’s too much trouble to report every day, let’s talk about it in a few days.” Some controlled elements even plan to buy off village cadres to sabotage the control system. Because the masses are not mobilized to control counter-revolutionary elements, the counter-revolutionary elements still flaunt their power in front of the masses. The masses reflect: "They are still getting along well with the cadres!" Because the cadres do not understand the meaning of dictatorship and think that control is ineffective, they want to send problems to the district and county governments for handling. Some villages have adopted other inappropriate methods. Some controlled elements have sentries standing guard at their doors, which makes the masses very tired. This approach can only be formal control; they are numb to the real sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements.

Another problem is that some counties and districts need to strengthen their organization and leadership of control work, as well as timely summarize experience and correct deviations.

Now, based on the situation and experience of control work in the rural areas of Anyang Prefecture, the following suggestions are made for future control work:

1.  It is necessary to mobilize the masses and explain the policies to them so that control work becomes mass-based. First of all, the counter-revolutionary activities of counter-revolutionaries in this village or locality should be exposed, and the counter-revolutionary crimes of the controlled elements should be announced in front of the masses, in order to raise the masses' awareness of counter-revolutionaries, arouse vigilance, and attach importance to control work. The controlled elements should be educated so that they can truly confess their crimes to the masses, be law-abiding, abide by the government's policies and decrees, and strive to transform themselves through labor.

2.  The targets of control should be accurately determined. When determining the targets of control, it is best to have them discussed by the masses, reviewed by the people's representatives, and approved by the district level. For example, Yongheji, Yexian County, initially determined to control twelve people, but after discussion by the masses, the control of five hooligans was revoked, and two more counter-revolutionary criminals were exposed and placed under control.

At the same time, when determining the targets of control, it is necessary to draw a clear line between the enemy and ourselves in accordance with the policies. Only by drawing a clear line and treating them differently can we effectively disintegrate and weaken the enemy.

3.  In order to strengthen the people's democratic dictatorship, a village public security committee should be established under the leadership of the village people's congress to regularly study the activities of saboteurs in the village and solve the problems that occur in the control. The best method of control is to combine the control group with the production mutual aid group. In this way, on the one hand, the purpose of transforming counter-revolutionary elements through labor can be achieved, and on the other hand, the malpractice of cadres doing everything on their own will be reduced because the strength of the masses is brought into play. Secondly, the method of combining mass supervision with administrative control should be used in the control, so as to grasp the activities of the controlled elements in a timely manner.

4.  Establish a regular control work system. This is very important. It is best that the village public security committee reviews the controlled elements every fifteen days or so; according to the results of the review, the controlled elements should be educated separately. For those who are changing their thinking quickly, they should be encouraged to speed up their transformation; those who are bad should be recorded, or struggled against, and more strictly controlled. In addition, the method of combining administrative control with labor reform should be used to regularly check the degree of completion of their production plans, so that they can be transformed in forced labor.

　　农村中应怎样管制反革命分子？
    张敬民
    加强对于反革命分子的管制工作，是镇压反革命的一项重要的而又十分复杂的工作。目前，平原省安阳专区农村中的管制工作尚存在某些问题与偏向，值得引起注意，并求得改进。
    目前管制工作中存在的主要问题，是确定管制对象时缺乏政策思想，划不清敌我界限。即是说，部分农村干部，还弄不清什么人应被管制，什么人不应被管制。不少村的被管制分子，是由几个干部简单商量一下，就被管制起来的。据调查，好多村把过去当过伪军的、任过伪职的，以及流氓、懒汉与某些说落后话的中农都当成了管制对象。浚县新镇村不到三百户，被管制的就有九十六户。汤阴县小庄村两个中农，因为使用辘轳事争吵打架；村干部怕他们互相报复——烧麦子，便把他们管制起来。由于村干部确定管制对象时草率从事，甚至假公报私，而扩大了管制面，混乱了自己的阵营，失掉了管制的效用。
    管制方法也亟须改进。不少村不是发动群众起来管制坏分子，而是局限在公安人员和几个村干部身上。所以发生这种现象的原因，主要是村干部还不认识管制工作是人民群众对敌人的一种专政手段，管制的目的是为了继续打击、分化敌人，巩固镇压反革命的胜利成果，而不去发动群众来管制反革命分子，只是单纯使用行政力量。因此，某些村的群众不知道村里究竟管制着那些人，和为什么要管制？被管制分子每日只是向村干部报告活动情况。个别坏分子就借此故意和干部为难，动一动就报告一次；久而久之，反革命分子不但没被管制好，村干部却背上了一个“包袱”。有的村把被管制分子的口头报告改为书面报告。但农忙时也就放松了管制。如浚县张西庄被管制分子对村干部说：“现在忙于收麦，每天报告多麻烦，过几天再说吧。”甚至有的被管制分子，有计划地收买村干部，破坏管制制度。因为不是发动群众起来管制反革命分子，所以反革命分子在群众面前还抖威风。群众反映：“还是人家在干部跟前吃得开！”因为干部不了解专政的意义，又认为管制不顶事，所以一有问题，就要送区、县政府处理。也有的村采取了另外的不适当的方式。某些被管制分子的门口都站有岗哨，弄得群众很疲劳。这种作法，只能是形式上的管制；对反革命分子的真正破坏活动，却又麻木不仁。
    再一个问题是，部分县、区对于管制工作的组织与领导，以及及时总结经验、纠正偏向等工作还有待加强。
    现在依据安阳专区农村管制工作的情况与经验，对今后管制工作提出如下意见：
    一、要发动群众，向群众讲明政策，使管制工作成为群众性的。首先应揭露本村或当地反革命的反动活动，并把被管制分子的反动罪行在群众面前公布出来，以提高群众对反革命的认识，引起警惕，重视管制工作。对管制分子，应进行教育，一定使他们能真正向群众服罪，能安分守己，遵守政府的政策法令，争取在劳动中改造自己。
    二、要准确地确定管制对象。在确定管制对象时，以经过群众讨论、人民代表会审查、区级复审批准为最好。如邺县永合集开始确定管制十二人，经群众讨论后，撤销了对五名流氓的管制，并又检举了两名反革命罪犯，管制起来。
    同时，在确定管制对象时，应根据政策划清敌我界限。只有划清界限，分别对待，才能有效地分化、瓦解敌人。
    三、为了加强人民民主专政，应在村人民代表会的领导下，建立村治安保卫委员会，定期研究本村破坏分子的活动情况，解决管制中所发生的问题。管制方法，最好是采取管制小组与生产互助组相结合的办法。这样一方面能达到在劳动中改造反革命分子的目的，另一方面也会因发挥了群众力量，而减少干部的包办代替的弊病。其次，在管制中应运用群众监督与行政控制相结合的办法，以便及时掌握被管制分子的活动情况。
    四、建立正规的管制工作制度。这是很重要的。最好是十五天左右村治安保卫委员会对被管制分子评审一次；根据评审的结果，分别向被管制分子进行教育。对于思想转变快的，勉励他们加紧改造自己；对坏的则记过，或进行斗争，更加严格地管制起来。另外，就是运用行政力量控制与劳动改造相结合的办法，定期检查他们的生产计划完成的程度，使他们能在强迫劳动中得到改造。
