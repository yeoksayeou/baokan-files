　　Today, thirty years ago, the Communist Party of China was born. From that day on, the liberation struggles of the oppressed nations of the East began to converge into the torrent of the world's proletarian social revolution. Before this, the entire East, including our China, had risen up against imperialist oppression one after another, but all had failed because of the lack of correct leadership. Since the founding of the Communist Party of China, the future of the revolution has gradually moved towards light and achieved today's brilliant victory. The Communist Party of China has brought today's independence, freedom, equality, and happiness to the Chinese people, established a powerful revolutionary fortress for the nations of the East, and strengthened the anti-aggression forces for the world's peace and democracy camp. Isn't this worthy of our rejoicing and holding grand celebrations?

　　Sun Yat-sen of our party launched the revolution from 1884, and with his spirit of continuous progress and unwavering perseverance, he did not achieve his revolutionary ideals despite long-term struggle. It was not until after the October Revolution in the Soviet Union that he accepted the experience of the Soviet revolution and further accepted the proposal of the Communist Party of China to establish a revolutionary united front, that he saw new light and determined a new revolutionary line, laying the foundation for the subsequent victory of the Northern Expedition. Therefore, during the First Domestic Revolutionary period from 1924 to 1927, the Communist Party of China actually bore the responsibility of leadership.

　　After Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal, thanks to the persistence of the Communist Party of China, the worker-peasant regime and the worker-peasant Red Army were established. During the Anti-Japanese War, thanks to the Communist Party of China's insistence on uniting to resist Japan and promoting democracy and progress, the conspiracies of the Chiang gang to fail and surrender were shattered, and victory was achieved. After the victory, American imperialism supported Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang and conspired to usurp the fruits of the people's victory during the Anti-Japanese War. It was even more due to the Communist Party of China mobilizing the people of the whole country, eliminating the Chiang bandit army, liberating the whole of China, and driving the American imperialists and their running dog Chiang bandit gang out of mainland China. This series of victories is inseparable from the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the great Chairman Mao.

　　Imperialism and all reactionary forces will not be reconciled to their demise. Last year, the U.S. imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea, which was the first step in attacking us. Since the democratic parties issued the joint declaration on November 4, correctly putting forward the demands of the people of the whole country and launching the volunteers to resist America and aid Korea, decisive victories have been achieved on the Korean front for more than seven months. However, the U.S. imperialists are still making a desperate struggle. This struggle will inevitably be long-term and arduous, but the final victory will inevitably belong to us. While warmly celebrating the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, we should give full play to our strength, enthusiastically respond to the recent three major calls of the General Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea, cooperate with the broad movements of suppressing counter-revolutionaries and land reform this year, universally formulate patriotic pacts, donate airplanes and artillery, and do a good job in providing preferential treatment. Our celebration today will have even greater significance.

　　Long live the great and glorious Communist Party of China!
　　Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao!

　　中国国民党革命委员会主席
    李济深的讲话
    三十年前的今天，中国共产党诞生了。从这一天起，东方被压迫民族的解放斗争，开始汇入了世界无产阶级社会革命的洪流。在这以前，整个的东方，包括我们中国，在帝国主义的压迫之下，前仆后继地起来反抗，但都因为没有正确的领导而失败。自从有了中国共产党，革命的前途，便逐步走向光明，取得今天光辉灿烂的胜利。中国共产党为我们中国人民带来了今天的独立、自由、平等、幸福，为东方各民族建立了强大的革命堡垒，为世界和平民主阵营增强了反侵略力量，这难道还不值得我们欢欣鼓舞地来举行盛大的庆祝吗？
    本党孙中山先生从一八八四年起发动革命，以其不断求进步的精神，坚持不屈，可是虽然长期奋斗，却没有达到他革命的理想，直到苏联十月革命之后，接受了苏联革命的经验。并进而接受了中国共产党建立革命统一战线的建议，才看到了新的光明，确定了新的革命路线，立下以后北伐胜利的基础。因此在一九二四到一九二七的第一次国内革命时期，中国共产党实际上是负着领导责任的。
    蒋介石叛变以后，由于中国共产党的坚持，建立了工农政权和工农红军。抗日期间，又由于中国共产党的坚持团结抗战和民主进步，而粉碎了蒋匪帮的失败投降的阴谋，取得胜利。胜利以后美帝国主义又支持蒋介石匪帮，阴谋篡夺抗日期间人民胜利的果实，更由于中国共产党的动员全国人民，消灭了蒋匪军，解放了全中国，将美帝及其走狗蒋匪帮逐出中国大陆去。这一连串的胜利，都是与中国共产党和伟大的毛主席的正确领导分不开的。
    帝国主义和一切反动势力都是不会甘心于死亡的。去年美帝发动侵朝战争，正是向我们进攻的第一步，自各民主党派发表了十一月四日的联合宣言，正确地提出全国人民的要求，发动志愿军抗美援朝，七个多月以来，在朝鲜前线，已取得决定性的胜利。不过美帝国主义还要作垂死的挣扎，这斗争，必然是长期的，艰苦的，而最后胜利必然是归于我们的。在热烈庆祝中国共产党建党三十周年纪念的时候，更应充分发挥我们的力量，热烈响应抗美援朝总会最近的三大号召，配合本年度镇压反革命和土地改革的广大运动，普遍订立爱国公约，捐献飞机大炮，并做好优抚工作，我们今天的庆祝才更有重大的意义。
    伟大的光荣的中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的中国人民领袖毛主席万岁！
