Reader's Letters

    To the Editor:
    The letter "Zhejiang Quzhou Prefecture Leading Organs Correct the Tendency of Not Emphasizing Political Study" was published in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on July 14th. As far as we know, the tendency of not emphasizing political study is common among cadres in various regions. This issue should attract everyone's attention.
    Our Suiyuan Province Tuoketuo County Study Committee held a test for cadres participating in theoretical study at the end of June. The test content included questions about the Chinese revolution and current affairs and policies. Cadres from various county-level units, a total of 89 people, participated in the test. The test results showed that as many as 70 people failed, accounting for 78.7% of the total number of participants. Many comrades still do not know the nature of the Chinese revolution at the present stage. Some answered "national revolution led by the bourgeoisie," and some said it was "a proletarian socialist revolution." Many comrades did not know when the Chinese Communist Party was founded. Regarding the policy of "sentencing to death, suspended for two years, forced labor, to see the effect" in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the vast majority of comrades did not answer completely, and some even mistakenly said it was "to increase China's population," or "these people have science and technology and are of great benefit to the construction of the new China."
    This is a serious problem. A revolutionary cadre who is not clear about the nature of the Chinese revolution at the present stage and the country's current important policies cannot lead the masses well to do revolutionary work. In our county, there are still many comrades who regard political study as a "burden" and believe that "study is irrelevant to work." This erroneous thinking must be corrected immediately.
    We have begun to pay attention to this issue and are studying ways to strengthen leadership over cadre study.

　　开始注意领导政治学习编辑同志：
    七月十四日人民日报《读者来信》栏刊载了《浙江衢州专区领导机关纠正不重视政治学习的偏向》一信。据我们所知，不重视政治学习的偏向，在各地干部中是普遍存在的。这个问题应该引起大家的重视。
    我们绥远省托克托县学习委员会在六月底对参加理论学习的干部举行了一次测验，测验内容包括中国革命问题及时事、政策问题。参加测验者有县级各单位的干部共八十九人。测验结果，不及格的竟达七十人，占参加测验总人数百分之七八·七。许多同志对中国现阶段的革命性质还不知道，有的答成“资产阶级领导的民族革命”，有的说是“无产阶级的社会主义革命”。许多同志不知道中国共产党是那一年成立的。对于镇压反革命运动中“判处死刑，缓刑两年，强迫劳动，以观后效”的政策，绝大部分同志都没有答完全，有的竟错误地说是“为了增加中国的人口”，或“这些人有科学技术，对新中国建设有很大利益”。
    这是一个严重的问题。一个革命干部，对中国现阶段革命的性质和国家当前重要政策等问题都搞不清楚，是不能很好地领导群众做好革命工作的。在我县，还有很多同志把政治学习看做是“负担”，认为“学习与工作无关”。这种错误思想必须立即纠正。
    我们已开始重视这个问题，正在研究办法加强对干部学习的领导。
