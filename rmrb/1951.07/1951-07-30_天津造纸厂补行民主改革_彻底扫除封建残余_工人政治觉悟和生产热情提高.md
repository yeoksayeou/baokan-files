　　Tianjin Paper Mill Carries Out Remedial Democratic Reform
　　Thoroughly Eliminating Feudal Remnants
　　Enhancing Workers' Political Consciousness and Production Enthusiasm
　　After the state-owned Tianjin Paper Mill carried out remedial democratic reforms, the consciousness of the staff and workers has generally improved, and the atmosphere in each workshop has been refreshed.

　　For more than two years since liberation, although the factory had established a system of workers' representative conferences, established a factory management committee, implemented democratic management, and abolished some unreasonable old management systems such as body searches, the leading cadres in the factory did not have a clear understanding of relying on workers and had a purely technical viewpoint. The feudal forces that oppressed workers left over from the old enterprise were not completely overthrown, so the workers' enthusiasm for production could not be fully realized. For example, most of the feudal elements known as the "Thirty-Six Friends" continued to serve as foremen, head foremen, and even workshop directors after liberation. Song Fangting, the feudal head of the repair workshop, had consistently beaten and scolded workers before liberation, and forced workers to give gifts for weddings, funerals, and festivals. After liberation, the factory's leading cadres, holding a purely technical viewpoint, not only did not deal with him but promoted him to deputy director of the workshop. Therefore, Song was able to continue to maintain a feudal clique of so-called "Twenty-One Friends," attack activists, slack off, and steal rubber boots, tin plates, etc. from the factory. During wage adjustments, he deliberately used overly left-wing slogans to encourage workers to demand more wages. Sun Zhenying, the head element of the pulping workshop, had privately set up a court before liberation, severely beating workers and forcing them to give gifts, directly deducting gift money from workers' wages, amounting to 20% to 30% of a month's salary. Sun Zhenying had already left the factory before liberation, but the factory's leading cadres, considering that Sun Zhenying's skills were still good, ignored the workers' opposition and recalled him, asking him to serve as head foreman. After returning to the factory, he continued to beat, scold, and exploit workers. The workers often said: "Tianjin has been liberated for more than two years, but we have not yet been liberated!" Therefore, production enthusiasm was not high.

　　During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the factory's leading cadres became vigilant after Wu Shutian and other three counter-revolutionary elements from the "Thirty-Six Friends" who frequently disrupted production were arrested and executed by the government. In April of this year, the factory management committee resolved to carry out remedial democratic reforms to completely defeat the remaining feudal forces in the factory. In carrying out this work, the leadership first made all cadres clearly recognize the necessity of relying on workers, and then vigorously mobilized workers to launch accusations. For example, the repair workshop had the largest remaining feudal forces. After the workshop director, Mao Fulu, clearly recognized the need to rely on workers, he went deep into the masses, first finding several workers who had suffered the most, enlightened their consciousness, and enabled them to dispel their concerns and take the lead in making accusations. At the same time, he also conducted propaganda and explanation aimed at the general workers' ideological concerns, such as fear of retaliation, fear that speaking out would be useless, fear of offending people, and fear that the leadership would not support them to the end. He also prevented and exposed the sabotage and threats of some feudal elements, finally enabling the worker masses to be universally mobilized and actively participate in the accusations.

　　After the accusations, the factory leadership made decisions based on the different circumstances of these feudal elements, either dismissing them and demoting them, or temporarily retaining them in their original positions for observation.

　　After the remedial democratic reforms in each workshop of the factory, the political consciousness of the worker masses has generally improved, and their enthusiasm for production has greatly increased. Yang Fengshan, a worker in the repair workshop, said: "The grievances of more than ten years have been released today. I will not only work hard, but also guarantee to teach everyone how to read drawings technically." After Li Chenghua, the foreman of the No. 3 machine in the papermaking workshop, was dismissed and demoted to a worker, the workers in his team created four new production records since the establishment of the factory in May and June. The pulping workshop, which had more than 20 accidents in April, eliminated accidents in June. The workers also asked to study politics. In the past, there were no newspaper reading groups in the repair, pulping, and papermaking workshops, but now each group in each workshop has established regular newspaper reading groups. Trade union group meetings could not be held in the past, but now workers consciously abide by the group meeting system and can conduct criticism and self-criticism at the meetings. The newly promoted workers are able to use democratic management methods, which greatly improves the relationship between leaders and the masses.

### 天津造纸厂补行民主改革  彻底扫除封建残余  工人政治觉悟和生产热情提高

　　天津造纸厂补行民主改革
　  彻底扫除封建残余
　  工人政治觉悟和生产热情提高
    国营天津造纸厂补行民主改革后，职工觉悟普遍提高，各车间气象一新。
    该厂解放两年多以来，虽曾建立了职工代表会议制度，成立了工厂管理委员会，实行了民主管理，废除了搜身制等若干不合理的旧管理制度；但因厂内领导干部依靠工人的思想不明确，存在单纯技术观点，对旧企业遗留下来的压迫工人的封建势力未彻底打倒，因而工人生产积极性不能充分发挥。如号称“三十六友”的封建分子，解放后大部分继续担任车间领班、总领班甚至车间主任。修理车间的封建把头宋芳亭，解放前一贯打骂工人，每逢婚、丧、节期都强迫工人送礼，解放后该厂领导干部因抱有单纯技术观点，不仅未加处理，反而提升为车间副主任。因而宋得以继续保持所谓“二十一友”的封建小集团，打击积极分子，消极怠工，偷窃厂内胶靴、锡板等。调整工资时，他又故意用过左口号，鼓动工人多要工资。打浆车间的把头分子孙振英，解放前曾私设公堂，毒打工人；强迫工人送礼，直接从工人工资内私自扣除礼金，所扣之数多达一月工资的百分之二、三十。孙振英在解放前本已离厂，但该厂领导干部以孙振英技术还好，竟不顾工人反对，将他召回，要他担任总领班职务。他回厂后又继续打骂和剥削工人。工人们常说：“天津解放两年多了，我们还没有解放！”因而生产情绪不高。
    在镇压反革命运动中，该厂经常破坏生产的“三十六友”中的吴树田等三个反革命分子被政府逮捕处决后，该厂领导干部方警惕起来。今年四月份，该厂管理委员会决议补行民主改革，以彻底打垮厂内封建残余势力。在进行这一工作时，领导方面首先使所有干部明确认识依靠工人的必要，然后大力发动工人展开控诉。例如修理车间的封建残余势力最大，车间主任毛富禄明确认识必须依靠工人后，就深入群众，首先找到几个受苦最深的工人，启发他们的觉悟，使他们打消顾虑，带头控诉。同时他又针对一般工人怕报复、怕说了不顶事、怕得罪人、怕领导上不撑腰到底等思想顾虑，进行宣传解释，并防止与揭发一部分封建分子的破坏、威胁，终于使工人群众普遍发动起来，积极参加了控诉。
    经过控诉，该厂领导方面即根据这些封建分子的不同情况，分别作了撤职降级使用，或暂留原职察看，以观后效。
    该厂各车间补行民主改革后，工人群众的政治觉悟普遍提高，生产热情大为高涨。修理车间工人杨凤山说：“十多年的冤气今天吐出来了，我不但要在工作上努力，还要在技术上保证教会大家看图。”造纸车间三号机领班李承华被撤职降为工人后，该班工人在五、六月份曾连创四次建厂以来的生产新纪录。四月份发生事故二十多次的打浆车间，六月份已消灭了事故。工人们并纷纷要求学习政治。过去修理、打浆、造纸等车间根本没有读报组，现在各车间每个小组都建立了经常性的读报组。工会小组会过去总是开不起来，现在工人们都自觉遵守小组会制度，并能在会上展开批评与自我批评。新提升为领班的工人，却能够运用民主管理方法，因而使领导与群众的关系大为改善。
