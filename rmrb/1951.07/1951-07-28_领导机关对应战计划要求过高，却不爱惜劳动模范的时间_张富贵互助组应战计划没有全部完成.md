　　According to the recent inspection by the CPC Wendeng County Committee, the Zhang Fugui Mutual Aid Team has largely completed the plan it set in the spring when challenging the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team. Some parts of the plan have even been exceeded, but some production plans have fallen short. For example, the team only plowed the spring land once and failed to plow it a second time; the plan was to press sand and replace soil on three mu, but only half a mu was completed; the original plan was to plant five mu and four fen of cotton, but two mu and two fen less were planted; plans to dig two wells, add a donkey, and raise two pigs were not realized; cultural studies were also relaxed.

　　The reason why the Zhang Fugui Mutual Aid Team did not fully complete the challenge plan is mainly that the local leading organs made excessive demands on the Zhang Fugui Mutual Aid Team's challenge plan, making some plans impossible to achieve. For example, the team of five households has a total of 78.4 mu of cultivated land, two semi-laborers, and four full laborers. Two of them often go out to work as tilers, and Zhang Fugui often goes out to meetings, leaving only one full laborer and two children under the age of sixteen or seventeen to work in the team. Given the team's situation, there was already a shortage of labor, but the local leading organs still required the team to dig two wells in the spring, press sand and replace soil on three mu, and organize a well-digging team to go out to dig wells, etc. After the plan was drawn up, the local leading organs did not strengthen the specific leadership of the team in all aspects, earnestly inspect the implementation of the plan, and help the team solve difficulties. Therefore, some of the team's challenge conditions were not met.

　　Secondly, the failure of the local leading organs to pay attention to cultivating Zhang Fugui and not cherishing his working time is also an important reason why the team failed to complete the plan in full. Zhang Fugui has 22.2 mu of cultivated land, with only himself as a full laborer and one head of livestock. In addition, he had to build eight thatched houses this spring, which made it difficult for him to cultivate the land carefully. However, the local leading organs treated Zhang Fugui as a cadre and added all kinds of work to him. Currently, Zhang Fugui holds twenty positions, which has resulted in many work delays. According to statistics, from January to mid-June, Zhang Fugui went out to meetings for a total of ninety-nine days, and only had seventy days at home. The local leading organs had high demands on the Zhang Fugui Mutual Aid Team's challenge plan, but did not give him enough working time to complete the plan, which not only made his personal production work unsuccessful, but also greatly weakened his production leadership in the team.

　　In order to strengthen the specific leadership of the Zhang Fugui Mutual Aid Team, the local leading organs have put forward the following improvement suggestions: First, strengthen the leadership of the team and the village, and assign a special person to regularly stay in the village to specifically help and summarize the team's work. Secondly, cherish Zhang Fugui's working time, and in the future, county and district meetings should allow him to ask for leave as much as possible, so that he has enough time to engage in production and lead production. Again, further strengthen the connection between the team and the county farm to help the team improve its technology and ensure high yields.

### 领导机关对应战计划要求过高，却不爱惜劳动模范的时间  张富贵互助组应战计划没有全部完成

　　领导机关对应战计划要求过高，却不爱惜劳动模范的时间
　  张富贵互助组应战计划没有全部完成
    根据最近中共文登县委检查的结果，劳动模范张富贵互助组今年春季向李顺达互助组应战时所订的计划已大部完成，部分计划且已超过，但是还有一些生产计划已经落空。如该组春地只刨了一遍，未能作到再耕一遍；计划压沙换土三亩，只完成了半亩；原计划种棉花五亩四分，结果少种了二亩二分；至于打井两眼，增添驴一头，猪二只等计划均未实现；文化学习也放松了。
    张富贵互助组没有全部完成应战计划的原因，主要是当地领导机关对张富贵互助组的应战计划要求过高，因此有些计划无法实现。如该组五户共有耕地七十八亩四分，半劳动力二人，整劳动力四人，内有二人经常外出做瓦工，张富贵又经常外出开会，组里只剩下一个整劳动力和两个不满十六、七岁的小孩子干活。根据该组上述情况，劳动力已经不足，但是，当地领导机关还要求该组在春季打井两眼，压沙换土三亩，并组织打井队外出打井等。在计划订出后，当地领导机关又没有从各方面加强对该组的具体领导，认真检查计划执行情况，帮助该组解决困难。因此，该组有些应战条件就落了空。
    其次，当地领导机关对张富贵不注意培养，不爱惜他的劳动时间，也是该组未能全部完成计划的重要原因之一。张富贵共有耕地二十二亩二分，只有他本人一个整劳动力和一头牲口，加上今春要盖草房八间，对精耕细作原已感到吃力。但是当地领导机关却把张富贵当作干部来使用，什么工作都加到他身上去，目前张富贵一身兼二十个职务，因此，误工很多。据统计，自一月至六月中旬，张富贵共外出开会九十九天，在家只有七十天的时间。当地领导机关对张富贵互助组的应战计划要求很高，但却不给他充分的劳动时间去完成计划，因此，不仅使他个人的生产工作没有搞好，而且使他对小组的生产领导也大大减弱。
    为着加强对张富贵互助组的具体领导，当地领导机关已提出以下改进意见：首先，要加强对该组和该村的领导，指定专人经常驻村具体帮助和总结小组工作。其次，爱惜张富贵的劳动时间，今后县区有些会议尽量准许其请假，使他有充分的时间去从事生产和领导生产。再次，要进一步加强该组与县农场的联系，以便帮助该组提高技术，保证丰产。
