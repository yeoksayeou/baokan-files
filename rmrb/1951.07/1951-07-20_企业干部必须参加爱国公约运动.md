　　Enterprise Cadres Must Participate in the Patriotic Pact Movement
    According to the Lüda People's Daily, many factory directors, workshop directors, technicians, and Party, labor union, and Communist Youth League cadres in the Lüda Canal have been leading the worker masses to formulate patriotic pacts every day, but they themselves have not yet formulated their own patriotic pacts. Many cadres believe that "Patriotic pacts are the business of workers and have nothing to do with cadres," "Patriotic pacts are to encourage workers' enthusiasm, do cadres still need encouragement?" "What patriotic pact or no patriotic pact, completing the production tasks is better than anything!" Now more than ninety percent of the workers in the canal have formulated and are implementing patriotic pacts. Their political consciousness is increasing day by day, and they are increasingly dissatisfied with the incorrect tendencies of cadres being detached from politics and the masses. Workers in many workshops have begun to question and criticize cadres, saying, "Patriotism is everyone's business, everyone must sign the pact, no one is an exception!" "If only the workers are mobilized and the cadres are not, can the patriotic pact be thoroughly implemented?" This situation reflected by the Lüda Canal deserves attention from all regions. The patriotic pact is a nationwide pact, a concrete action program for the people to unite and struggle together under the banner of patriotism, on a voluntary basis. Therefore, the broader the mass base participating in the patriotic pact, the better. In factories and enterprises, it should include not only workers but also cadres; cadres have the responsibility to lead the patriotic pact movement, but first they must personally participate in the movement and use practical actions to show that they are model implementers of the patriotic pact, truly leading by example and playing a leading role in the movement.
    Currently, in some enterprises, some cadres believe that the patriotic pact is just a means to stimulate production enthusiasm, which is completely wrong. In areas where such thinking exists, Party organizations must conscientiously conduct criticism and self-criticism among Party members and cadres, examine the root causes of these erroneous ideas, ideologically educate cadres to recognize the political significance of the patriotic pact, and break the erroneous view that the patriotic pact movement is opposed to production work; call for the formation of a patriotic pact movement in enterprises, based on voluntarism and aimed at patriotic production increase, including all departments. And resolutely overcome the phenomenon of separation between cadres and the masses and the uneven development of the movement among production departments in the movement. Experience has proven that any production enterprise department, if there is only a patriotic pact among workers but no patriotic pact of the factory leadership cadres, only a team patriotic pact but no workshop patriotic pact, then a truly lasting mass movement cannot be formed. Even if the movement is temporarily launched among the worker masses, it is impossible to coordinate and unify the steps between departments, so that the collective strength cannot be fully exerted.
    The lesson of the serious disconnection between cadres and the masses in the Lüda Canal's patriotic pact movement should be noted by all regions. We hope that the Lüda Party Committee will quickly find ways to correct this deviation. According to the Lüda People's Daily on July 16, although the Canal Enterprise Party Committee has already paid attention to this, it has not yet studied specific methods to reverse this situation in a timely manner. This shows that it is necessary to continue to strengthen the Party's leadership, ideologically solve the cadres' non-political, purely production-oriented views, educate cadres to conscientiously participate in the movement, seriously and responsibly put forward their own patriotic pacts, and accept the inspection and supervision of the masses in the movement. Party members and members of the Communist Youth League among enterprise cadres should especially play the leading role of the Party in implementing the patriotic pact and strive to become models in implementing the patriotic pact.

### 企业干部必须参加爱国公约运动

　　企业干部必须参加爱国公约运动
    据旅大人民日报载：旅大船渠有许多工厂厂长、车间主任、技师和党的、工会的、青年团的干部虽然天天在领导工人群众订立爱国公约，可是自己却一直到现在还没有把爱国公约订出来。许多干部认为“爱国公约是工人的事，与干部无关”，“爱国公约是鼓励工人情绪的，干部还用得着鼓励么？”“什么爱国公约不爱国公约，生产任务完成了比什么都好！”现在船渠工人有百分之九十以上已经订立和执行了爱国公约。他们的政治觉悟一天比一天地提高，因而对于干部脱离政治、脱离群众的不正确倾向，日益表示不满。不少车间的工人已开始向干部提出质问和批评，他们说：“爱国是大家的事，大家都要订公约，任何人不能例外！”“光是工人动起来，干部不动，爱国公约能执行得彻底吗？”旅大船渠所反映的这一情况值得各地注意。爱国公约是全民公约，是人民在爱国主义旗帜下，在自愿的基础上，团结起来共同奋斗的具体行动纲领。因此，参加爱国公约的群众基础愈广泛愈好。在工厂企业中，不但要包括工人而且要包括干部；干部有责任领导爱国公约运动，但首先必须是亲身参加到运动中去，用实际行动表现自己是爱国公约的模范执行者，真正做到以身作则，在运动中起带头作用。
    现在在某些企业单位中，有些干部认为爱国公约只是用来刺激生产热情的一个手段，这是完全错误的。凡是存在这样思想的地区，党的组织都要认真地在党员和干部中展开批评与自我批评，检查产生这些错误思想的根源，从思想上教育干部认识爱国公约的政治意义，打破那种把爱国公约运动同生产工作对立起来的错误看法；号召在企业单位中形成一个以自愿为基础的、以爱国增产为主要目的的包括一切部门的爱国公约运动。并在运动中坚决克服干部与群众脱节以及生产部门间运动发展不平衡的现象。经验证明，任何生产企业部门，如果只有工人间的爱国公约而没有厂方领导干部的爱国公约，只有小组爱国公约而没有车间爱国公约，便一定不能形成真正持久的群众运动。即使在工人群众中把运动一时搞起来了，也不可能作到各部门间步骤协调和一致，这样，就不能充分发挥集体的力量。
    旅大船渠在订立爱国公约运动中，干部和群众严重脱节的教训，应当提起各地注意。我们希望旅大党委迅速设法纠正这一偏向。据七月十六日的旅大人民日报报道：船渠企业党委对此虽早已引起了注意，但是仍未研究出具体办法来及时扭转这一情况。这就说明必须继续加强党的领导，从思想上解决干部中不问政治、单纯的生产观点，教育干部认真参加运动，严肃负责地提出自己的爱国公约，并在运动中接受群众的检查和监督。企业干部中的党员、团员尤应在贯彻执行爱国公约中发挥党的领导作用，争取自己成为执行爱国公约的模范。
