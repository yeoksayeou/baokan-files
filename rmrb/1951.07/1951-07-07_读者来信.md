    Responding to the Motherland's Call, Join the Military Cadre School!
    (I)
    Our great and beloved motherland has once again issued a solemn call to our younger generation, calling on us young people to participate in the national defense construction. I am a member of the Youth League, a student of the Mao Zedong era, and I am determined to respond to the call of the motherland with practical actions.
    I love my learning environment and I love everything about our great motherland. We love it, cherish it, and we must use our strength to defend it.
    I have heard some reports about Korea and know that since American imperialism launched its war of aggression against Korea, the factories, mines, schools, rural areas… built by the Korean working people with countless sweat and blood have been severely damaged and continue to suffer. The Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, fighting side by side, have dealt a fatal blow to the American aggressors, shattering the American imperialists' arrogant plan to conquer Korea, China, and the world. However, American imperialism is still illegally intensifying the arming of Japan and West Germany and is still occupying our Taiwan. Therefore, strengthening national defense construction has become our important task.
    I have long decided to dedicate everything I have to the motherland with infinite loyalty. At the end of last year, when the motherland called on young people to join the military cadre school, I immediately signed up; but I was not approved. I worked even harder to study and exercise, ready to respond to all the calls of the motherland at any time. Now, the moment I have been longing for has arrived. I will happily sign up for the military cadre school and go to the place where the motherland needs me most.
                   Huang Zhixian, Second Branch of Normal University (manuscript fee donated for airplanes and cannons)
   (II) Comrade Editor:
    After seeing the Government Administration Council's "Decision on Recruiting Students for Various Military Cadre Schools," we immediately jumped up with joy. We had long been prepared to dedicate ourselves to the motherland's national defense. Last year, when the military cadre school recruited students, we signed up, but we were not approved. At that time, we were determined to fight for the realization of our aspirations. In the past six months, we have worked hard to study and exercise, so that we are qualified to participate in the motherland's national defense construction. Now, the motherland has once again issued a call to young people across the country. We resolutely respond to this solemn call, sign up to take the entrance examination for the military cadre school, and strive to become soldiers of the people to defend the motherland and smash the imperialist aggression plot.
    Ma Zhanling, Duan Fuhai, Zhang Bokai, Yang Fengxiang, Wang Jiaqi, Lu Kai, Dai Deming, Students of Tongxian County Normal School
    (III) Comrade Editor:
    I am an overseas Chinese student who returned from Siam. I resolutely respond to the call of the motherland and join the military cadre school.
    In the past, we overseas Chinese were orphans without a motherland. We suffered all kinds of oppression from imperialism abroad; the Kuomintang reactionary government not only did not seek welfare for the overseas Chinese but also acted as a running dog of imperialism and oppressed the overseas Chinese. After the birth of the new China, we overseas Chinese have a motherland. The overseas Chinese are all beaming with joy and are happy for the prosperity and strength of the motherland.
    Two years ago, I returned to the embrace of the motherland and studied at Beijing Huiwen Middle School. After two years of education at the school, especially the anti-American and aid-Korea patriotic education, I love our great motherland and the People's Government even more.
    In order to defend our beloved motherland, I am determined to dedicate myself to the motherland's national defense. Now the motherland has called on its young sons and daughters to go to the glorious national defense construction post. I am determined to respond to this great call and contribute all my strength to the motherland's national defense construction!
                            Li Wenlan, Student of Class A, Junior Grade 3, Beijing Huiwen Middle School
    (IV)
    The motherland calls on us young people to participate in the national defense construction. I excitedly respond to this call and will take practical actions to strive to be a soldier who is most needed by the people to defend the motherland.
    The main reason why I can resolutely subordinate my personal interests to the needs of the motherland this time is that the anti-American and aid-Korea movement has educated me for more than half a year. I remember when the military cadre school was recruiting students last year, I also signed up; but at that time I only thought that I was a member of the Youth League and should obey the needs of the people; ideologically and emotionally I was quite reluctant, so I was not approved that time.
    During the deepening of the anti-American and aid-Korea patriotic movement, for several months, I went with my classmates to factories, rural areas, and among urban residents to carry out anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda work. In my work, I further realized how lovable the motherland is. The People's Volunteers are fighting heroically with the enemy on the Korean battlefield for our lovable motherland, to defend the people's peace and happiness. Some have already contributed their precious lives. When I think of them, I no longer consider personal interests, because that is such a selfish and shameful thing!
    Today, the great motherland has issued a solemn call to us young people. I am a youth of the new China, nurtured by Mao Zedong and the great Chinese people, and inspired by patriotic thought, I have become stronger. I welcome this call from the motherland to me with unparalleled enthusiasm.
                                    Yang Kaiming, Student of Peking University
            Strengthening National Defense is the Only Way to Ensure Peace!
        (I)
    Li Qiwei has expressed his willingness to accept Malik's proposal for ceasefire and armistice negotiations between the warring parties in Korea, and is preparing to hold armistice talks. This is because our struggle has inflicted serious blows on the American imperialists, forcing them to accept Malik's proposal.
    We Chinese people have always been peace-loving. We have always advocated a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. However, we are not afraid of enemy aggression. In order to defend peace, we have used our own strength to seriously strike the aggressors, effectively preventing the mad dogs from attempting to invade our sacred border, reversing the situation on the Korean front, and forcing Li Qiwei to consider and accept Malik's proposal to hold armistice talks.
    The Chinese people have rich experience in the long revolutionary struggle. We should be vigilant, guard against all enemy conspiracies, and eliminate all complacency. The People's Daily editorial tells us: "Before the ceasefire and armistice are truly realized, all Chinese and North Korean troops on the Korean front must be on high alert to prevent possible sneak attacks by the enemy, which is extremely important and must not be relaxed. In the rear, all anti-American and aid-Korea work throughout the country must not be relaxed in the slightest before the ceasefire and armistice are truly realized. Even after the armistice is realized, the construction of national defense is still very important." This instruction is very correct. We must resolutely implement this spirit into every specific task!
                                          Reader Zhao Xi
    (II) Comrade Editor:
    After the People's Daily published the news on July 2 that "Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai notified Li Qiwei that they agreed to hold Korean armistice talks," some people believed that the upcoming armistice talks meant "peace" and developed a kind of complacency.
    This idea is wrong. Because whether American imperialism has the sincerity to ceasefire and armistice, and peacefully resolve the Korean issue, remains to be proven by its future actions. We must be highly vigilant about American imperialism's expression of armistice talks.
    The facts fully prove that the more the Chinese people's anti-American and aid-Korea movement develops and deepens, the stronger the Chinese people's unity becomes, and the greater their strength; the more panicked American imperialism becomes; and the more consolidated the peace camp becomes. The People's Daily editorial on July 3 reminds us: all anti-American and aid-Korea work in the rear and throughout the country must not be relaxed in the slightest before the ceasefire and armistice are truly realized. This is what all our people must firmly remember.

     Are Wu Xun and Ah Q Similar?
    ——Opinions on Jia Ji’s article “Wu Xun Who Is Not Worthy of Emulation”
    Comrade Jia Ji said in his article "Wu Xun Who Is Not Worthy of Emulation": "The film tells us that Wu Xun's character is similar to Ah Q, but Wu Xun has a miracle that Ah Q does not have, that is: begging to run schools." I think that the "characters" of Ah Q and Wu Xun are completely different, therefore, the endings of the two are exactly the opposite. If we lump the two together, it is tantamount to covering up Wu Xun's true face and the reactionary nature of *The Life of Wu Xun*.
    The character of Ah Q written by Mr. Lu Xun is a character with a strong desire for life, a tenacious character. Ah Q is very self-respecting and never gives in: he is "often dissatisfied"; he "often wins"; he "is three generations higher than the scholar of the Zhao family"; he looks down on the "fake foreign devils"; he "wants to make revolution"; he sings "Holding a steel whip, I will beat you,...;" When he is about to be beheaded, he also says "Twenty years later, I will be another...". Of course, because Ah Q does not yet have the revolutionary consciousness, he fights in a chaotic manner, resulting in "struggling" every day and failing in everything. But what about Wu Xun? His character is to kowtow to everyone he meets, to bow to everyone he meets; especially in front of the feudal forces, he is a lump of soft flesh without bones.
    Precisely because Wu Xun has such a character, he has a different ending from Ah Q: Ah Q was shot by representatives of the feudal forces; Wu Xun soared among the feudal class.
    Ah Q and Wu Xun are representative typical figures of two classes since the Opium War. Ah Q represents the peasants of the Xinhai Revolution who did not have revolutionary consciousness, while Wu Xun was a pawn of the landlord class to paralyze the peasants in the era of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Ah Q's struggle should be given some sympathy, and criticized for his backwardness and "lack of goodness". Mr. Lu Xun treated Ah Q with such an attitude. Wu Xun's evil deeds should be deeply hated, while Mr. Sun Yu praised him. What else is this if not a matter of attitude and standpoint?

    We Must Face Our Mistakes
    ——Some Opinions on Mr. Duanmu Hongliang's Self-Criticism
    In his article *On the Life of Wu Xun*, Mr. Duanmu Hongliang listed many far-fetched reasons to praise Wu Xun. But in his self-criticism *Wu Xun is a Model Figure Affirmed by the Feudal Rulers*, he believes: "This is mainly due to the lack of materials we have mastered and the deviation in understanding, which is a rough and careless work style." He doesn't understand what kind of self-criticism he has made, but says: "...this is because the remnants of feudal thought in China cannot be completely eliminated at once, and we still retain the narrow altruistic thinking: the thinking of 'enduring a stomach ache will pass', the thinking of enduring humiliation, etc...." It seems to say: Why did I mistakenly praise Wu Xun? This is all because the remnants of feudal thought in China cannot be completely eliminated at once, and all Chinese people are like this! Such a self-criticism is not satisfactory.
    Why would there be "insufficient mastery of materials," "deviation in understanding," and "rough and careless work style"? In *On the Life of Wu Xun*, Mr. Duanmu Hongliang clearly wrote: "Our attitude towards history must be a scientific attitude, and a correct historical view must be used to deal with it. Only by mastering scientific methods can we see through the external Wu Xun and find the internal Wu Xun...". So, what is the author's "historical view"? How did the author "see through the external Wu Xun and find the internal Wu Xun"? The self-criticism does not touch on it at all. I think this attitude towards mistakes is very unserious. Mr. Duanmu Hongliang's second article, although superficially different from his first article, is consistent in its ideological essence. I hope that Mr. Duanmu Hongliang can face his mistakes squarely and make a further serious self-criticism.

    响应祖国的号召，参加军事干部学校！
    （一）
    伟大可爱的祖国又一次向我们年青一代发出庄严的号召，号召我们青年参加国防建设事业。我是青年团员，毛泽东时代的学生，决心以实际行动来响应祖国的号召。
    我热爱我的学习环境，热爱我们伟大祖国的一切。我们热爱它、珍惜它，就必须用我们的力量来保卫它。
    我曾经听了一些关于朝鲜的报告，知道自从美帝国主义发动侵朝战争以来，朝鲜劳动人民用无数血汗建设起来的工矿、学校、农村……，已经遭到了而且继续遭受着严重的破坏。中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，已经给美国侵略军以致命的打击，粉碎了美帝国主义企图征服朝鲜、中国和全世界的狂妄的侵略计划。但是，美帝国主义还在非法地加紧武装日本和西德，还在占领着我们的台湾。因此加强国防建设就成了我们重要的任务。
    我早已决定以无限忠诚把自己的一切献给祖国。去年年底，当祖国号召青年参加军事干部学校的时候，我立刻报了名；但是却没被批准。我就更加努力地学习和锻炼身体，随时准备着响应祖国的一切号召。现在，我所渴望的时机到了。我将愉快地报名参加军事干部学校，到祖国最需要我的地方去。
                   师范大学二院  黄智显（稿费捐献飞机大炮）
   （二）编辑同志：
    看到政务院《关于各种军事干部学校招收学生的决定》后，我们立刻高兴得跳了起来。我们早就准备着献身祖国的国防事业。去年军事干部学校招收学生时，我们报了名，但却没被批准。当时，我们决心要争取我们的志愿实现。这半年多来，我们努力学习，锻炼体格，使我们有条件参加祖国的国防建设事业。现在，祖国已经再次向全国青年发出了号召。我们坚决响应这个庄严的号召，报名投考军事干部学校，争取做一个人民的战士，来保卫祖国、粉碎帝国主义的侵略阴谋。

    （三）编辑同志：
    我是一个从暹罗归国的华侨学生。我坚决响应祖国的号召，参加军事干部学校。
    过去，我们华侨是没有祖国的孤儿。我们在国外受尽了帝国主义的压迫；国民党反动政府不但不给华侨谋福利，反而充当帝国主义的走狗，压迫华侨。新中国诞生后，我们华侨有了祖国。华侨们都眉开眼笑，为祖国的繁荣、壮大而高兴。
    两年前，我回到了祖国的怀抱，在北京汇文中学读书。经过学校两年来的教育，尤其是抗美援朝爱国主义教育，我更加热爱我们的伟大祖国和人民政府。
    为了保卫可爱的祖国，我决心献身给祖国的国防事业。现在祖国已经号召他的青年儿女走向光荣的国防建设岗位。我决心响应这个伟大的号召，在祖国国防建设事业中贡献出自己的一切力量！
                            北京汇文中学初三甲班学生  李文澜
    （四）
    祖国号召我们青年参加国防建设事业。我兴奋地响应这个号召，并将以实际行动来争取做一个人民所最需要的保卫祖国的战士。
    我这次所以能够毅然以个人利益服从祖国的需要，主要原因是半年多来抗美援朝运动教育了我。记得在去年军事干部学校招生时候，我也报了名；但当时只是认为自己是一个青年团员，应该服从人民的需要；在思想上感情上是相当勉强的，所以那次我就未被批准。
    在抗美援朝爱国运动转向深入时，几个月来，我曾与同学们一道走进工厂，走到农村，深入市民群众，进行抗美援朝的宣传工作。在工作中，我进一步认识了祖国的可爱。人民志愿军为了我们可爱的祖国，保卫人民的和平与幸福，在朝鲜战场上与敌人进行着英勇的战斗。有些已经贡献了他们宝贵的生命。当我想到他们的时候，我就不再考虑个人的利益了，因为那是多么自私与可耻的事啊！
    今天伟大的祖国向我们青年发出庄严的号召。我是一个新中国的青年，在毛泽东和伟大的中国人民的教养下，在爱国主义思想的鼓舞下，我坚强了起来。我以无比的热情来迎接这次祖国对我的召唤。

            加强国防才能确保和平！
        （一）
    李奇微已表示愿意接受马立克提出的由朝鲜交战双方谈判停火与休战的提议，并准备举行停战谈判。这是因为我们的斗争已经给予美帝国主义者以严重的打击，使它不得不接受马立克的建议。
    我们中国人民一向就是酷爱和平的。我们一贯主张和平解决朝鲜问题。但是，我们并不畏惧敌人的侵略。我们为了保卫和平，已经用自己的力量严重地打击了侵略者，有效地制止了疯狗们侵犯我国神圣边疆的妄图，扭转了朝鲜战局，而迫使李奇微不得不考虑和接受马立克的建议，举行停战谈判。
    中国人民在长期革命斗争中，已经有了丰富的经验。我们应该提高警惕，严防敌人一切阴谋，消灭一切麻痹思想。人民日报社论告诉我们：“在停火和停战真正实现以前，在朝鲜前线的一切中朝军队必须严阵以待，防止敌人的可能的乘机袭击，这一点是极端重要的，决不能松懈。在后方在全国的一切抗美援朝工作，在停火和停战真正实现以前，同样不能有丝毫的松懈。即在停战实现以后，国防的建设还是十分重要的。”这个指示是非常正确的。我们一定要把这种精神，坚决贯彻到每一件具体工作中去！
                                          读者  赵曦
    （二）编辑同志：
    七月二日人民日报发表了《金日成彭德怀两将军通知李奇微，同意举行朝鲜停战谈判》的消息后，有些人就认为将要进行的停战谈判就是“和平”了，产生了一种麻痹思想。
    这种思想是不对的。因为美帝国主义是否有诚意停火停战、和平解决朝鲜问题，还有待于其今后的行动来证明。我们对于美帝国主义停战谈判的表示，必须提高警惕。
    事实完全证明，中国人民的抗美援朝运动愈开展，愈深入，中国人民的团结就更坚强，力量就更大；美帝国主义就更恐慌；和平的阵营也就更巩固。人民日报七月三日的社论提醒我们：在后方在全国的一切抗美援朝工作，在停火停战真正实现以前，不能有丝毫的松懈。这是我们全国人民必须牢牢记住的。

     武训与阿Ｑ相类似吗？
    ——对贾霁《不足为训的武训》一文的意见
    贾霁同志在《不足为训的武训》一文中说：“影片告诉我们：武训的性格与阿Ｑ相类似，但是，武训有阿Ｑ所没有的奇迹，那就是：行乞兴学。”我认为，阿Ｑ和武训两个人物的“性格”是截然不同的，因此，他们两人的结局也正好相反。如果我们把二者混为一谈，那就等于把武训的真实面目和《武训传》的反动性掩盖起来了。
    鲁迅先生所写的阿Ｑ的性格是一个具有强烈的生活欲望的性格，是一个顽强的性格。阿Ｑ很自尊，从不服气：他“常不平”；他“常优胜”；他“要比赵家秀才高三辈”；他看不起“假洋鬼子”；他“要革命”；他唱“手执钢鞭将你打，……；”临到杀头他还说“过了二十年，又是一个……。”当然，由于阿Ｑ还没有革命的觉悟，乱斗一气，以致天天“斗争”，而事事失败。然而武训呢？他的性格是逢人就叩头，逢人就弯腰；特别在封建势力的面前，他是一摊没有骨头的软肉。
    正因为武训有这样一种性格，就有了和阿Ｑ不同的结局：阿Ｑ被封建势力的代表者枪毙了；武训在封建阶级中间飞黄腾达了。
    阿Ｑ和武训是代表了鸦片战争以来两个阶级的典型人物。阿Ｑ是代表了辛亥革命时期没有革命觉悟的农民，而武训则是太平天国时代地主阶级麻痹农民的爪牙。对阿Ｑ的斗争应予以某些同情，而批评其落后与“不善”，鲁迅先生是以这样的态度对待了阿Ｑ。武训的罪恶行径应当深恶痛绝，而孙瑜先生则歌颂了他，这不是态度立场问题又是什么呢？

    要正视自己的错误
    ——对端木蕻良先生自我检讨的一点意见
    端木蕻良先生在《论＜武训传＞》一文中，列举了许多牵强附会的理由来歌颂武训。但在他的检讨《武训是封建统治者所肯定的示范人物》一文里，他却认为：“这主要是由于我们所掌握的材料不足及认识的偏差，是一种粗枝大叶的作风。”他不懂没有进行什么检讨，却说：“……这是由于中国残存的封建思想还不能一下子就肃清的原故，我们还残存着狭义的利他主义思想：“忍个肚子痛就过去了”的思想，逆来顺受的思想等等……。”仿佛说：我为什么错误地歌颂了武训呢？这都是因为中国残存的封建思想，还不能一下子就肃清的缘故呀，中国人大家都如是呀！这样的检讨是不能令人满意的。
    为什么会“掌握材料不足”、“认识偏差”和“粗枝大叶”呢？在《论＜武训传＞》一文中，端木蕻良先生分明写着：“我们对历史的态度，必需用科学的态度，正确的历史观来对付他不可，惟有掌握科学的方法，才能透过外在的武训，寻找内在的武训……。”那么，什么是作者的“历史观”呢？作者又是怎样“透过外在的武训，寻找内在的武训”的呢？检讨中却丝毫没有触及。我认为这种对待错误的态度，是十分不严肃的。端木蕻良先生的第二篇文章，和他第一篇文章，虽然从表面上看来说法不同，但在其思想实质上是一致的。希望端木蕻良先生能正视自己的错误，并进一步作严肃的自我检讨。
