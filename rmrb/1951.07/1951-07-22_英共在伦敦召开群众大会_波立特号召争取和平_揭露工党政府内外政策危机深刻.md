Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 17th: A report from the *Pravda* correspondent in London, Mayevsky: To promote the Communist program "Britain's Road to Socialism," the British Communist Party organized a mass rally in London on July 15th, attended by over 10,000 people. This rally was a clear manifestation of the British people's desire for peace. On that day, Trafalgar Square was densely packed with people. These were representatives of workers, staff, and intellectuals from various London enterprises. Among them were British people, Indians, Ceylonese, and black people from African colonies; there were mothers holding children; there were veterans wearing medals. In front of the stage stood huge banners: "The Communist Party fights for peace, higher wages, and national independence!"

The General Secretary of the Communist Party, Pollitt, stepped onto the platform and was warmly welcomed by the participants. In his speech, Pollitt pointed out the deep crisis in the domestic and foreign policies pursued by the Labour government, which was subservient to Washington's dictates, and explained the most important parts of the Communist Party's program. Pollitt emphasized that the Communist Party's program, "Britain's Road to Socialism," answered all the major questions facing the British working class. He pointed out that Britain is currently a weak link in the peace movement. He said: "We must strive to make the entire chain of peace solid." Pollitt called on the British people to intensify the struggle for peace, for genuine democracy, and for national independence.

During the meeting, hundreds of attendees signed the Peace Pact declaration. At the same time, dozens of people joined the Communist Party. At the end of the meeting, all participants made a solemn vow: "In order to save world peace, I pledge to promote the conclusion of a Peace Pact by the five major powers." Then, warm cheers resounded three times in the square. The meeting ended with everyone singing "The Red Flag" and "The Internationale."

Mayevsky pointed out: Rallies of this nature have been held many times in Britain. As the Labour government's reactionary policies bring endless disasters to the British people, the Communist Party's call, based on its program "Britain's Road to Socialism," has received increasingly strong support from the masses of working people across the country.

Mass rallies held by the Communist Party in Manchester, Nottingham, and other cities show that the Communist Party, which stands at the forefront of the struggle for peace and British national interests, has increased its prestige and influence. Hundreds of British patriots are joining the ranks of the Communist Party.

　　英共在伦敦召开群众大会
　  波立特号召争取和平
　  揭露工党政府内外政策危机深刻
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十七日讯：《真理报》驻伦敦记者马耶夫斯基报道：英国共产党为了宣传共产党纲领“英国走向社会主义之路”，于七月十五日在伦敦组织了一个有一万多人参加的群众大会。这次大会是英国人民渴望和平的明显表现。当天下午，特拉法加广场密密地聚满了人。这是伦敦各企业的工人、职员以及知识分子的代表。其中有英国人与印度人、锡兰人与非洲殖民地的黑人；有抱着孩子的母亲；有挂着奖章的退伍军人。主席台前摆着巨大的标语牌：“共产党为争取和平、提高工资与国家独立而斗争！”
    共产党总书记波立特走上讲台，受到与会者热烈的欢迎。波立特在发言中指出仰承华盛顿鼻息的工党政府所奉行的内政外交政策的深刻危机，并说明了共产党纲领的最重要部分。波立特强调说，共产党纲领“英国走向社会主义之路”回答了英国工人阶级所面临的一切主要问题。他指出，英国目前在和平运动中还是薄弱的一环。他说：“我们应当努力使和平的整个连锁都成为牢固的。”波立特号召英国人民加紧争取和平、争取真正民主、争取国家独立的斗争。
    在开会过程中，成百个到会群众在和平公约宣言上签了名。同时有几十个人参加了共产党。大会结束时，全体参加大会的人都发出庄严的誓言说：“为了拯救世界和平，我保证促使五大国缔结和平公约。”接着在广场上三次响起了热烈的欢呼声。大会在全体高唱《红旗歌》与《国际歌》声中结束。
    马耶夫斯基指出：这种性质的大会在英国已经举行过许多次。当工党政府的反动政策为英国人民带来无限灾难的时候，共产党根据它的纲领“英国走向社会主义之路”而发出的号召得到了全国劳动群众越来越强大的支持。
    共产党在曼彻斯特、诺定昂及其他城市召开的群众大会表明，在争取和平与英国国家利益的斗争中站在最前列的共产党，它的威信与影响已经增加了。英国的爱国分子成百地参加到共产党的队伍中来。
