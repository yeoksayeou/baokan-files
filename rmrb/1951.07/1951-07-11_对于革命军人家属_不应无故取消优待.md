　　Regarding Benefits for Families of Revolutionary Soldiers Should Not Be Cancelled Without Reason

    Comrade Hou Fuliang, a soldier at our station, is from South Main Street in the town of Sarlachi County, Suiyuan Province. He joined the People's Liberation Army in July 1946. After his hometown was liberated, our station sent Hou's enlistment certificate and a notice for families of revolutionary soldiers to Hou's family, and his family received preferential treatment. In early May of this year, Hou Fuliang's father, Hou Youfeng, wrote a letter saying: this spring he received eight dou of government subsidized grain, but now the district government says he does not have a revolutionary soldier's family certificate and requires him to obtain proof from the unit within ten days, otherwise he must return the subsidized grain in full. After seeing the letter, in addition to reporting to the higher-level political organ to reissue a notice for families of revolutionary soldiers, which Hou Youfeng personally took to the government for registration and filing, we also suggested that the Sarlachi County government conduct an in-depth inspection of the preferential treatment work in the district and villages, and should not allow the status of families of revolutionary soldiers to be deprived of their security without reason.
            A certain logistics department station of the Chinese People's Liberation Army  Zhang Qi To the Editorial Board:

    Comrade Zai Yichen of our unit is from Taiping Village, Sixth District, Shuangcheng County, Songjiang Province. He joined the army in 1946. Because his parents died when he was young, he was raised by his cousin. His cousin's family has financial difficulties. After the unit issued the revolutionary soldier certificate this time, Comrade Zai Yichen sent his certificate back. However, after Zai Yichen's certificate arrived in the village, the village chief not only did not provide relief, but also said that the certificate was forged by Zai Yichen. We believe that the attitude of the village cadres in Taiping Village in neglecting the revolutionary soldier certificate is wrong and we hope it will be corrected.
    Also, Comrade Wang Baoxiang of our unit is from Xiliu Village, Gaoyang County, Hebei Province. He joined the army in 1948. His father is old and there is no labor force in the family, and they have suffered from floods for two consecutive years, so the family life is very difficult. However, when his father took the revolutionary soldier certificate to the district or county people's government to request relief, the district and county governments irresponsibly pushed the matter to the village, and the village cadres did not resolve it. We believe that their attitude towards families of revolutionary soldiers is wrong and we hope the Gaoyang County District Government will investigate and deal with it.

　　对于革命军人家属
    不应无故取消优待编辑同志：
    我站战士侯福亮同志系绥远萨拉齐县城内南大街人，于一九四六年七月参加人民解放军。他的家乡解放后，我站便给侯福亮家寄去侯的入伍证及革命军人家属通知书，其家庭即受到优待。本年五月上旬侯福亮的父亲侯有丰来信说：今春领到政府优待粮八斗，现在区政府说他没有革命军人家属证明，限他十天取得部队证明，否则须将优待粮如数退回。我们见信后除呈报上级政治机关再次发去革命军人家属通知书一纸，由侯有丰亲自持证去政府登记备案外，并建议萨拉齐县政府应对区村的优抚工作进行深入检查，不应使革命军人家属地位无故失去保障。
            中国人民解放军某兵团后勤部兵站  张岐编辑同志：
    我部载义臣同志是松江省双城县第六区太平村人，一九四六年参加部队，因小时父母双亡，由其表兄抚养，其表兄家庭生活困难，部队这次发了革命军人证明书后，载义臣同志即将自己的证明书寄回去了。但是载义臣的证明书到村后，该村村长不但不予救济，反而说这个证明是载义臣假造的。我们认为太平村村干部这样忽视革命军人证明书的态度是不对的，希望改正。
    还有我部王保祥同志是河北省高阳县西柳村人，一九四八年参加军队，他的父亲年老，家中无劳动力，并连遭二年水灾，家庭生活很困难。可是他的父亲拿了革命军人证明书到区或县人民政府请求救济时，区、县政府很不负责地把这事推到村里，村干部也不给解决。我们认为他们以这种态度对待革命军人家属是不对的，希高阳县区政府调查处理。
