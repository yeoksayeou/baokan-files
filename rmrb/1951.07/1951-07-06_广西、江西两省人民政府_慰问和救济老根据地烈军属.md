　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, July 4th: The Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Guangxi Provincial People's Government, and the Guangxi Military Region of the People's Liberation Army jointly organized a慰问团 (comfort delegation), led by Military Region Commander Li Tianyou. Carrying cash and goods totaling 1 billion yuan, they visited the old revolutionary base areas in the Youjiang River Basin from May 29th to June 19th, to express their condolences to the families of revolutionary martyrs of the Red 7th Army, military families, and the people. The delegation of over a hundred people, upon arriving in Bose, divided into two groups: one group went to counties such as Tiandong and Tianyang, and the other went to counties such as Donglan, Wangang, and Fengshan. In each county, they held慰问大会 (comfort rallies), distributed慰劳品 (comfort goods), invited the families of martyrs and military personnel to dine together, and staged performances and film screenings. More than 2,500 families of martyrs and military personnel throughout the region received慰劳品 (comfort goods) and慰劳金 (comfort money). The慰问大会 (comfort rally) in Donglan County was held in front of the tomb of Comrade Wei Baqun, commander of the 21st Division of the Red 7th Army, a revolutionary martyr. The families of martyrs and military personnel were deeply grateful for the care shown by the Communist Party and the People's Government. Many people went to pay their respects to Martyr Wei Baqun. Huang Songjian, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Guangxi Provincial People's Government and a native of Donglan, who had served as Deputy Commander of the 21st Division of the Red 7th Army, led a team to Donglan and Wangang to express condolences to the families of martyrs and military personnel. The families felt particularly close to him. When recounting their struggles since parting, many shed tears. Huang Songjian's mother-in-law, whose daughter had been killed by the reactionaries and who was now blind, felt her way from dozens of miles away to Donglan. While touching Huang Songjian from head to toe, she said with mixed feelings of sorrow and joy, "I don't need to see; I knew you would come back. I had dreamed of you returning several times." After the comfort meetings, the families of martyrs and military personnel used the慰问金 (comfort money) to buy oxen, grain, and farm implements, in response to the People's Government's call to increase production, and pledged to lead the masses in implementing government policies and decrees. The masses also expressed their determination to diligently help the families of martyrs and military personnel who lacked labor by plowing and sowing on their behalf. Note: In 1927, the people of more than ten counties in the Youjiang River Basin of Guangxi, under the leadership of Zhang Yunyi, the current Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial People's Government, launched an armed uprising, established the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army's Seventh Army, and established the Youjiang Workers' and Peasants' Government with Bose as its center. Since the main force of the Red 7th Army left Guangxi in 1930, the revolutionary people of the Youjiang area continued to persist in fighting behind enemy lines under the leadership of Comrade Wei Baqun. After Comrade Wei Baqun's sacrifice in 1932, the local people continued to wage a life-and-death struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries, the landlord class, and Japanese imperialism for more than twenty years with unwavering loyalty.
　　
    Also: The Jiangxi Provincial People's Government allocated 7.5 million catties of rice in mid-June to provide relief to the families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and working cadres in the old revolutionary base areas during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, as well as the local people.

　　广西、江西两省人民政府
    慰问和救济老根据地烈军属
    【新华社汉口四日电】中共广西省委员会、广西省人民政府及人民解放军广西军区共同组织慰问团，由军区司令员李天佑率领，携带了总值十亿元的现金和物资，于五月二十九日至上月十九日在右江流域第二次国内革命战争时期的老根据地，慰问红七军革命烈士家属、军人家属和人民。慰问团一行百余人于抵达百色后，即分成两路：一路赴田东、田阳等县，一路赴东兰、万冈、凤山等县。在各县分别召开了慰问大会，发送慰劳品，请烈属、军属聚餐，并演剧及放电影。全区二千五百余户烈属、军属都得到了慰劳品和慰劳金。东兰县的慰问大会是在革命先烈红七军二十一师师长韦拔群同志的墓前举行的，烈属、军属对共产党和人民政府的关怀深为感激，很多人去祭祀韦拔群烈士。万冈县的慰问大会是结合镇压反革命工作举行的，当场公审并枪决了曾杀害无数革命同志的大恶霸黄河清等三人，同时对烈士举行了公祭。广西省人民政府民政厅长黄松坚是东兰人，曾任红七军二十一师副师长，当他带队去东兰、万冈一带向烈属、军属慰问时，家属们感到分外亲切，在叙述别后斗争经历时，很多人都流下泪来。黄松坚的已被反动派杀害的爱人的母亲，双眼已瞎，从几十里外摸到东兰。她一面从头到脚地摸着黄松坚，一面悲喜交集地说：“我不用看，我知道你们会回来的，我早在梦里几次看见过你们回来了。”慰问会后，烈属、军属们都把慰问金买了耕牛、粮食和农具，以响应人民政府增加生产的号召，并保证带领群众执行政府政策、法令。群众也表示一定要认真帮助缺乏劳动力的烈属、军属代耕代种。按：广西右江流域十余县的人民，一九二七年在现任广西省人民政府主席张云逸领导下举行了武装起义，成立了中国工农红军第七军，并以百色为中心建立了右江工农政府。自一九三○年红七军主力离广西后，右江地区革命人民即在韦拔群同志领导下继续坚持敌后斗争。一九三二年韦拔群同志牺牲后，当地人民仍坚贞不屈地与国民党反动派、地主阶级及日本帝国主义进行了二十余年的生死斗争。
    又：江西省人民政府于上月中旬拨出大米七百五十万斤，救济第二次国内革命战争时期的老根据地的革命烈士、军人和工作干部的家属及当地人民。
