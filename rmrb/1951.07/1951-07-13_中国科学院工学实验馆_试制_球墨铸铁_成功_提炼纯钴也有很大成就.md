Chinese Academy of Sciences Engineering Experiment Hall
　　Successfully Trials "Ductile Iron"
　　Achieves Great Success in Refining Pure Cobalt
    The Chinese Academy of Sciences Engineering Experiment Hall has completely succeeded in researching ductile iron. The researchers at the hall began studying ductile iron in July 1950 and have conducted 83 trials, producing six tons of castings (including high-pressure valves, gears, ingot molds, anvils, rock crushing plates, high-pressure pump castings, important castings for universal testing machines, glass molds, Bessemer steel furnace castings, diesel engine castings, etc.). The magnesium alloys melted included four types: copper-magnesium, nickel-magnesium, silicon-nickel-iron-magnesium, and silicon-iron-magnesium. According to the hall's multiple operational experiences, the absorption rate of magnesium is highest with nickel-magnesium alloys, followed by silicon-iron-nickel-magnesium, copper-magnesium, and silicon-iron-magnesium alloys. In the future, when ductile iron is produced in large quantities in China, copper-magnesium and silicon-iron-magnesium alloys will be more economical and suitable (in countries with abundant nickel production, nickel-magnesium alloys are often used). For each experiment, the hall systematically varied the composition and usage of various magnesium alloys, with detailed records of the raw material (pig iron) composition, iron liquid temperature, magnesium alloy particle size, method of addition, and processing time. The cast samples were also subjected to detailed chemical analysis, physical property testing, and metallographic examination.
    Ductile iron is a newly invented special cast iron because the graphite it contains is spherical, which is very different from the flake graphite in ordinary cast iron. Simply put, ductile iron has the properties of steel and malleable cast iron (i.e., wrought iron), and in some respects, it even surpasses them. Compared to making this iron versus casting steel, the equipment is simpler, the cost is lower, and it is easier to produce in large quantities. Compared to making malleable cast iron, it does not require lengthy heat treatment and is not limited by thickness. These advantages are very valuable. Ductile iron is still a new industrial material in advanced countries like the Soviet Union and others. The Chinese Academy of Sciences Engineering Experiment Hall, recognizing the importance of this type of cast iron for China's industrialization, promoted its manufacture in various regions after its successful research. The hall has also formulated promotion measures according to the instructions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

    The Chinese Academy of Sciences Engineering Experiment Hall Achieves Significant Success in Refining Pure Cobalt. The cobalt ore used by the hall contains only about two percent cobalt, making it very difficult to refine. After detailed research, the hall overcame many difficulties and recently refined pure cobalt. Chemical analysis shows that this refined pure cobalt contains 99.9% cobalt (including a small amount of nickel), 0.04% iron, 0.02% copper, 0.02% lead, 0.01% zinc, 0.007% manganese, and 0.003% sulfur. In addition to refining pure cobalt, the ore can also recover a large amount of manganese as a byproduct. Cobalt is a relatively scarce metal with a wide range of uses, such as contact agents for synthetic petroleum, permanent magnets, and hard alloys, all of which require large amounts of cobalt. In the past, China's cobalt needs relied entirely on foreign supply. After the hall's successful research, it will be possible to refine it in large quantities domestically in the future.

### 中国科学院工学实验馆  试制“球墨铸铁”成功  提炼纯钴也有很大成就

　　中国科学院工学实验馆
　  试制“球墨铸铁”成功
　  提炼纯钴也有很大成就
    中国科学院工学实验馆研究球墨铸铁完全成功。该馆的研究人员自一九五○年七月开始研究球墨铸铁，共试制八十三次，制成的铸件达六吨（包括高压凡而、齿轮、钢锭模、铁砧、轧石板、高压泵铸件、万能材料试验机重要铸件、玻璃模子、柏塞麦炼钢炉铸件、柴油机铸件等），所熔制的镁合金有铜镁、镍镁、矽镍铁镁、矽铁镁四类。据该馆多次操作经验，镁的吸收率以镍镁合金为最高，矽铁镍镁、铜镁、与矽铁镁合金次之。今后在我国大量生产球墨铸铁时以铜镁与矽铁镁合金较为廉价合用（在产镍丰富的国家，则多采用镍镁合金）。该馆的每次试验都有计划地变更各种镁合金的成分和使用量，对于原料（生铁）的成分、铁液温度、镁合金粒子大小、加入方法、处理时间等都有详细的记录。所铸成的试样也都做了详细的化学分析、物理性质检验和金相检验。
    球墨铸铁是一种最新发明的特殊铸铁，因为它所含的石墨是球形的，和普通铸铁里的片状石墨大不相同。简单地来说，球墨铸铁是具有钢和延性铸铁（即马铁）的性质，在有些地方还超过了它们。如果把制这种铁和铸钢相比，则设备简单，成本低廉，易于大量生产；如果和制延性铸铁相比，则无需冗长时间的热处理，且不受厚度的限制。这些优点都是十分可贵的。球墨铸铁在先进国家苏联和别的国家也还是一种新的工业材料。中国科学院工学实验馆鉴于此种铸铁对于中国工业化的重要，在研究成功后，就提倡各地制造。该馆并根据中国科学院的指示，已拟定推广办法。

    中国科学院工学实验馆提炼纯钴获重大成就。该馆所用的钴矿，含钴仅约百分之二左右，因此很不易提炼。该馆经过详尽的研究，克服了很多困难，最近已炼成纯钴。经化学分析这种提炼后的纯钴含钴（包括少量之镍）百分之九九·九，铁百分之○·○四，铜百分之○·○二，铅百分之○·○二，锌百分之○·○一，锰百分之○·○○七，硫百分之○·○○三。该矿除提炼纯钴外，并可收回大量的锰为副产品，钴系一种比较稀少的金属，用途很广，如人造石油用的接触剂、永久磁钢和硬质合金等，都需用大量的钴。过去国内需要的钴全仗国外供给，该馆的研究成功后，国内将来可以大量提炼。
