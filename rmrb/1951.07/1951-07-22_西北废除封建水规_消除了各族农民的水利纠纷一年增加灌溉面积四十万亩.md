The Northwest Abolishes Feudal Water Regulations
　  Eliminates Water Disputes Among Ethnic Farmers, Increases Irrigated Area by 400,000 Mu Annually
　　While carrying out rent reduction, anti-local tyrant, and land reform movements, farmers in the Northwest region abolished the long-standing feudal water regulations and unreasonable canal management systems in the area. Now, farmers in various places have established their own management organizations in major canals. This tremendous change has not only increased the irrigated area of each canal but also fundamentally eliminated water disputes among farmers of various ethnic groups over the years, strengthening the unity of all ethnic groups. According to incomplete statistics, in the past year, due to the improved management system, the new and old canals in the Northwest region have increased the irrigated area by approximately 400,000 mu. The irrigated area of the Jinghui Canal in Shaanxi Province alone has increased by 80,000 mu.
　　The Northwest region has a high terrain, and most of the farmers' cultivated land is irrigated by water from canals. In the past, the water rights of canals in various parts of the Northwest were mostly controlled by local tyrant landlords. According to statistics of about 600 water disputes that occurred in Qinghai and Gansu provinces last year, the vast majority were caused by the instigation and manipulation of local tyrant landlords and the unreasonable water system. The "water lords" and "dragon officials" in the Yarkand River basin in southern Xinjiang and the more than 4 million mu of irrigated area west of the Yellow River in Gansu Province were almost all directly headed by local tyrant landlords. Before liberation, they colluded with reactionary bureaucrats, used various malpractices such as "water passing ceremonies" and "favoritism water," illegally stole and sold water, and deliberately created disputes, resulting in tragic mutual killings among farmers of various ethnic groups. For example, farmers in the 7th and 3rd townships in the eastern district of Jiuquan County, Gansu Province, have often had water disputes for more than 100 years. Countless lives and property have been lost in fights every year. In 1942 alone, the silver dollars spent on water conservancy litigation by farmers in the two townships amounted to more than 3,000, and the losses in agricultural production were even more incalculable. Last summer, after persuasion and education by working cadres of the local people's government, the farmers of the two townships began to realize that their common enemies were the local tyrant landlords who controlled water rights and the rulers such as the Chiang and Ma bandit gangs. From then on, the farmers of the two townships became reconciled.
　　The abolition of feudal water regulations and unreasonable canal management systems in the Northwest region was mainly carried out in the rent reduction, anti-local tyrant, and land reform movements of farmers throughout the region. Last year, millions of farmers in the Northwest region waged reasoned struggles against local water tyrants. More than 600 farmers in the 5th township of Zhaowu District, Linze County, Gansu Province, once held withered soybeans and sorghum seedlings and reasoned with Tian Shiying, a local tyrant landlord who occupied water rights and put water into the sandy land. Tian Shiying could not deny it and handed over the management rights of the Nine-Eye Canal to the farmers on the spot. The people's governments at all levels and local water conservancy authorities have tried to make appropriate and quick handling of water disputes that have occurred in various places. After the handling, they immediately assisted local farmers in rectifying management organizations or establishing new management systems. For example, the Kan'er well dispute among the people of the Uygur, Han, Kazak, and Hui ethnic groups in Shazaoquan Village, Sanbao District, Hami County, Xinjiang, which had been disputed for 13 years, was resolved this spring when Se-ti-ba-tu, the county magistrate of the county people's government, personally went to the village to mediate, and mobilized the masses to develop water sources and save water by excavating old wells and digging new wells.
　　After farmers of all ethnic groups abolished feudal water regulations and unreasonable canal management systems, they paid more attention to the maintenance of canals and consciously abided by water use discipline. Last year, the canal repair efficiency of migrant workers in Gaotai County, Gansu Province, doubled compared with the previous year. This year, the spring canal repair project efficiency of migrant workers in Ningxia Province also increased by more than 30% compared with last year, and the quality of the projects has also been significantly improved.
　　In order to train the leading backbone of the management organizations of each canal, the Northwest Water Conservancy Department has held local water management personnel training classes in each major canal. Seventy-one water management personnel from Chenggu, Xixiang, and other counties in southern Shaanxi have learned agricultural production policies and water conservancy management methods under the leadership of the local water conservancy bureau this spring. All these measures are extremely important for ensuring the increase of irrigated area by 1.5 million mu in the Northwest region this year and ensuring the bumper harvest of agricultural products in the region.

### 西北废除封建水规  消除了各族农民的水利纠纷一年增加灌溉面积四十万亩

　　西北废除封建水规
　  消除了各族农民的水利纠纷一年增加灌溉面积四十万亩
    西北区农民在进行减租、反恶霸和土地改革运动的同时，废除了该地区多年来的封建水规和不合理的渠道管理制度。现在，各地农民已在各主要渠道成立了自己的管理组织。这一巨大的变革，不但增加了各渠道的灌溉面积，并且从根本上消除了各民族农民历年来的水利纠纷，加强了各民族的团结。据不完全统计：一年来，西北全区的新旧渠道因为改善了管理制度，共增加灌溉面积约四十万亩，仅陕西省泾惠渠的灌溉面积就增加了八万亩。
    西北全区地势高亢，农民的耕地绝大部分是靠水渠的水灌溉。过去西北各地水渠的水权，大都操在恶霸地主的手里。根据去年青海、甘肃两省所发生的大小约六百件水利纠纷的统计，绝大部分是由于恶霸地主的煽动、操纵和用水制度的不合理所造成的。新疆南部的叶尔羌河流域和甘肃省黄河以西四百多万亩灌溉区域的“水佬”、“龙官”几乎全是恶霸地主直接出头担任。他们在解放前勾结反动官僚，利用“过水礼”、“人情水”等各种陋规，非法偷水、卖水，并故意制造纠纷，酿成各族农民间互相仇杀的惨剧。如甘肃省酒泉县城东区七、三两乡的农民，一百多年来常因用水闹纠纷，双方每年因械斗所伤损的人命和财产无数。仅一九四二年，两乡农民因水利诉讼所耗费的银元即达三千多元，在农业生产上的损失更无法计算。去年夏天，两乡农民经过当地人民政府工作干部说服教育以后，才开始认识到他们共同的敌人是把持水权的恶霸地主和蒋、马匪帮等统治者，两乡农民从此和好起来。
    西北区废除封建水规和不合理的渠道管理制度，主要是在全区农民的减租、反恶霸和土地改革运动中进行的。去年，西北全区曾有数百万农民向当地的水霸进行了说理斗争。甘肃省临泽县昭武区五乡的农民六百余人曾经手拿着被旱枯的大豆和高粱苗，向霸占水权将水放入沙地的恶霸地主田世英讲理，田世英无可抵赖，当场将九眼渠的管理权交给农民。对于各地所发生的水利纠纷，各级人民政府和当地的水利机关都尽可能很快地作出适当的处理，处理之后，立即协助当地农民整顿管理组织或建立新的管理制度。如曾经争执了十三年的新疆哈密县三堡区沙枣泉村的维、汉、哈、回各族人民的坎井纠纷，今春，该县人民政府县长色一提巴图亲到该村进行调解，以发掘旧井、增挖新井的办法，发动群众开辟水源，节约用水，这一水利纠纷便迎刃而解。
    各族农民废除了封建水规和不合理的水渠管理制度以后，更加注意了渠道的养护工作，对于用水纪律都能自觉地遵守。去年甘肃高台县民工的修渠效率即较前年提高了一倍，今年宁夏省民工的春修水渠工程效率也较去年提高了百分之三十以上，所作工程的质量也有显著的改进。
    西北水利部为培养各渠道管理组织的领导骨干，已在各主要渠道举办了地方行水人员训练班。陕西南部城固、西乡等县的七十一名行水人员，今春已在当地水利局的领导下学习了农业生产政策和管理水利的方法。这一切措施，对于保证西北全区今年增加灌溉面积一百五十万亩，和保证全区农产的丰收都有极其重要的作用。
