　　The Sanwan Reorganization
    Tan Zheng
    As early as the autumn of 1927, after the failure of the Autumn Harvest Uprising in Hunan, the troops were gathered from the battlefield. Every day, they set off before dawn and didn't camp until after dusk. After passing through Pingjiang, Liuyang, Tonggu, and Pingxiang, they arrived at Sanwan, within the Yongxin territory southeast of Lianhua, and began reorganizing the troops. This was considered a difficult hurdle in the history of the Red Army's development. Since the defeat in the Changshou Street battle, the Hunan enemies desperately chased after us, always trying to wipe out these revolutionary seeds. How could untrained "little kids" withstand such storms? They got sick, died, got tired, and got scared, and their morale was very low. It was as if we had fought dozens of losing battles.
    On the second day after arriving in Sanwan, the division commander gathered the troops and spoke: "...Now the number of personnel has decreased, and the troops must be reduced in size, reorganized from a division into a regiment; even a regiment is not enough, reorganized into two battalions..." I couldn't listen anymore, and only saw everyone in the audience staring blankly at him, looking very sad. Suddenly, the newly appointed regimental commander introduced Comrade Mao Zedong to speak. A tall man walked out from the crowd, with long, unkempt hair, wearing a tattered cotton-padded coat of the common people, and leggings on his legs, and straw sandals on his feet. He walked to the front of the troops with a kind attitude and a smiling face, and everyone immediately smiled and applauded. "...Comrades, the enemy is only firing cold shots at our backs, what's so great about that?... Everyone is born of a mother, the enemy has two feet, and we also have two feet... Comrade He Long started with two kitchen knives and is now an army commander, leading an army of people. We now have more than just two kitchen knives, we have two battalions of people, are we still afraid of not being able to make something of ourselves?... You all came out of the uprising, one of you can be worth ten enemies, and ten of you can be worth a hundred. We now have a few hundred people in our ranks, what are we still afraid of!?... Without setbacks and failures, there would be no success!..." Everyone nodded and smiled continuously, showing a particularly excited appearance. After the troops were dismissed, I only saw groups of people talking about it: "Comrade Mao Zedong is not afraid, what are we still afraid of?" "Comrade He Long was able to start with two kitchen knives, can't we start with a few hundred people?"

　　三湾改编
    谭政
    远在一九二七年的秋天，湖南秋收起义失败以后，部队从战场上收拾下来。每天总是从天未明就出发，一直走到黄昏以后才宿营。经过平江、浏阳、铜鼓、萍乡到达莲花东南永新境内的三湾，着手改编部队。这算是红军发展史上的一个难关。自从长寿街战斗失败以后，湖南的敌人，拚命地跟着我们后面追赶，总想把我们这些革命种子，一下弄个精光。没有经过锻炼的“小娃娃”，那容易经得起这样的风波？弄得病的病，死的死，累的累，怕的怕，情绪非常不好。真象打了几十个败仗一样。
    到了三湾的第二天，师长集合部队讲话：“……现在人员减少了，部队要缩编，从一个师改编为一个团；一个团还不足，改编为两个营。……”听不下去了，只看到全场的人，大家都瞪着眼睛，痴呆似的望着他，非常难过。忽然由新任团长介绍毛泽东同志出来讲话。从人丛中走出一个又高又大的人来，头上蓄着长久未剪的头发，身上穿着一件老百姓的烂棉袄，腿上却打上一双绑腿，脚上套着一双草鞋。他以和蔼的态度，含笑的脸色，走到部队前面，登时大家笑容可掬地鼓起掌来。“……同志们，敌人只是在我们后面放冷枪，这有什么了不起？……大家都是娘生的，敌人他有两只脚，我们也有两只脚。……贺龙同志两把菜刀起家，现在当军长，带了一军人。我们现在不只两把菜刀，我们有两营人，还怕干不起来吗？……你们都是起义出来的，一个可以当敌人十个，十个可以当他一百。我们现在有这样几百人的队伍，还怕什么！？……没有挫折和失败，就不会有成功！……”大家不住地点头微笑，显示着特别兴奋的样子。当着队伍解散以后，只看到一群一群的在那里讲论着：“毛泽东同志不怕，我们还怕什么？”“贺龙同志两把菜刀能够起家，我们几百人还不能起家吗？”
