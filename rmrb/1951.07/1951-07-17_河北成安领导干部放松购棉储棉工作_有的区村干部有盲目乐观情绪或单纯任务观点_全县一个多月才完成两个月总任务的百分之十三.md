Hebei Cheng'an Leaders Relaxed on Cotton Purchase and Storage Work
    Some District and Village Cadres Have Blindly Optimistic Sentiments or a Purely Task-Oriented View
    County Only Completes 13 Percent of Two-Month Total Task in Over a Month
    The cotton purchase and storage work in Cheng'an County, Hebei Province, although having achieved certain results since its commencement, has not yet been fully mobilized. Cheng'an County is a key county in the Handan Special District's cotton purchase and storage work, with a total acquisition and storage task requiring completion by the end of July. However, statistics from June 1st to July 3rd show that the entire county only completed 13.8 percent. The main reasons for this phenomenon are as follows:
    Firstly, Party and government leaders at all levels lack sufficient attention to this patriotic cotton sales and storage political task. They blindly believe that cotton farmers do not have much cotton in storage, and they lack confidence in completing the cotton purchase and storage task. It was not until around June 26th that the districts specifically deployed this work to the villages. In the specific work arrangement, they did not determine the key work points based on the actual local situation, according to the importance and urgency and the size of the task. Instead, they mechanically followed the special district's work deployment, determining that patriotic bumper harvest pest control was the central task, placing the small summer grain requisition task and the cotton purchase and storage task, which accounted for nearly one-fifth of the entire special district's task, on an equal footing. District and village cadres' thoughts were not clear, and they only focused on the pest control and summer grain requisition tasks, leaving the cotton purchase and storage task aside. In the Xiwu Village area of the first district, where cotton aphids were not serious, cadres were also concentrated to lead the aphid control. Beixiao District in the second district is a cotton-producing area, and cotton farmers have the most cotton in storage, but the leadership drew most of the cadres to Nanxiao District to rush aphid control. As a result, among the sixty-eight villages in the district, by June 30th, only a few villages such as Dazhai and Zhanghedian had begun to take action on the patriotic cotton sales and storage work.
    Secondly, some district and village cadres have blindly optimistic sentiments about the cotton purchase and storage work. They mistakenly believe that after the cotton price adjustment, the interests of cotton storage households have been further guaranteed, and cotton farmers will naturally take out their stored cotton to sell or store to the state. They underestimated cotton farmers' conservative and reluctant-to-sell mentality and relaxed their leadership. The patriotic cotton sales and storage committees in most villages throughout the county have not yet been established. After holding general meetings of Party members, cadres, and the masses in each village of the first district, they believed that the publicity work had been done well, and cotton farmers could all take action to actively sell cotton. As a result, only a few Party members, cadres, and a small number of cotton farmers sold cotton. Most cotton farmers did not sell their stored cotton. Cotton farmer Zhang Guifang secretly transported more than 2,400 jin of cotton stored for three years to other villages to sell or store. After cotton farmers in Linlibao Village sold more than 10,000 jin of cotton, the cadres believed that the cotton farmers had taken out all their stored cotton. After inspection, it was found that many cotton farmers each stored 1,000 to 2,000 jin of cotton, and they have not sold any of it to this day.
    There are also some district and village cadres who have a purely task-oriented view on completing the cotton purchase and storage work, ignoring in-depth patriotic ideological education for cotton farmers. This prevents the patriotic cotton sales and storage movement from being carried out effectively. Some village cadres have even resorted to compulsory threats to cotton farmers to sell cotton in order to complete the cotton purchase and storage task. Cadres in Huangling Village, Third District, inspected cotton farmers' homes for stored cotton under the pretext of searching for spies. Cadres in Xijie Village, Chengguan, said to cotton farmers: "Anyone who has stored cotton and does not sell it in three days will have it confiscated and turned over to the public." This coercive approach not only fails to get cotton farmers to take out their stored cotton to sell to the state, but instead increases cotton farmers' ideological concerns and blocks the door for cotton farmers to sell and store cotton.
    The Cheng'an Branch of the China Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company downgraded the purchase of cotton purchased by the county supply and marketing cooperative on its behalf. The county supply and marketing cooperative was afraid of losing money and has delayed formally signing a purchase agreement until now. This has also caused some losses to the cotton purchase and storage work. Furthermore, because the cotton prices at the junction of Cheng'an and Linzhang counties are unbalanced, a large amount of cotton stored in Cheng'an is transported to Linzhang County for sale. This has affected the cotton purchase and storage work in Cheng'an County.
    The Cheng'an County Committee of the Communist Party of China has begun to pay attention to the above problems, and on July 3rd, it once again issued an urgent instruction to the district committees of each district to rapidly complete the two major political tasks of cotton purchase and storage and the elimination of cotton aphids. The county party secretary has gone to each district to supervise and inspect the progress of the cotton purchase and storage work.

### 河北成安领导干部放松购棉储棉工作  有的区村干部有盲目乐观情绪或单纯任务观点  全县一个多月才完成两个月总任务的百分之十三

　　河北成安领导干部放松购棉储棉工作
    有的区村干部有盲目乐观情绪或单纯任务观点
    全县一个多月才完成两个月总任务的百分之十三
    河北省成安县的购棉储棉工作，自开始到现在，虽获得一定成绩，但还没有全面行动起来。该县是邯郸专区购棉储棉工作的重点县，总的收购储存任务要求在七月底全部完成；可是从六月一日到七月三日的统计，全县才完成百分之十三点八。产生这种现象主要有以下几个原因：
    首先是各级党、政领导干部，对这一爱国售棉储棉的政治任务缺乏足够重视。盲目地认为棉农存棉不多，对完成购棉储棉任务信心不足。直到六月二十六日左右，各区才把这一工作具体布置到村。在具体工作安排上，没有根据当地实际情况，按着轻重缓急、任务大小，确定工作重点，只是机械地按专区的工作布置，确定以爱国丰产除虫为中心，把数量很小的夏征任务和占全专区将近五分之一的购棉储棉任务放到平列地位。区、村干部思想不明确，只突击了除虫、夏征工作，把购储棉任务丢在一边。一区西魏村一带，本来棉蚜并不严重，也集中干部去领导治蚜；二区北小区是产棉区，棉农存棉也最多，领导上却把大部分干部抽到南小区去突击治蚜。结果，该区六十八个村庄，到六月三十日，爱国售储棉工作，只有大寨、漳河店等几个村庄才开始行动起来。
    其次是有的区、村干部，对购棉、储棉工作有盲目乐观情绪。错误地认为棉价经过调整，进一步保证了存棉户利益，棉农自然就会把存棉拿出来卖给或存给国家。对棉农的保守、惜售思想估计不足，放松了领导。全县大多数村庄的爱国售棉、储棉委员会，到现在还没有着手建立。一区各村在普遍开过党员、干部、群众大会以后，便认为宣传工作做好了，棉农全可以行动起来积极卖棉。结果只是几个党员干部和少数棉农卖棉。大多数棉农存棉不卖。棉农张贵芳把三年的存棉二千四百多斤偷着运到外村卖掉或储藏起来。林里堡村棉农卖棉一万多斤后，干部便认为棉农把存棉都拿出来了。经过检查又发现不少棉农各存棉一、两千斤，到现在一点还没有卖。
    还有一部分区、村干部对完成购棉储棉工作有单纯任务观点，忽视了对棉农进行深入的爱国思想教育。使爱国售棉储棉运动不能很好的开展起来。甚至有的村干部为完成购棉储棉任务，发生了强迫威胁棉农卖棉的现象。三区黄岭村干部，以搜查特务为名，到棉农家里检查存棉。城关西街村干部对棉农说：“谁有存棉过三天不卖，查出来没收归公。”这种强迫命令的做法，不光不能使棉农把存棉拿出来卖给国家，相反倒增加了棉农的思想顾虑，堵塞了棉农售棉储棉的大门。
    花纱布公司成安支公司降级收购县供销社代购的棉花，县供销社怕赔钱，一直拖延到现在还没有正式签订代购合同。这也使购棉储棉工作受到一定损失。又因为成安、临漳两县交界处的棉价不平衡，使成安的存棉大量运到临漳县出卖。使成安县购棉储棉工作受到影响。
    中共成安县委对以上问题已开始注意，并于七月三日再次向各区区委发出为迅速完成购棉储棉与消灭棉蚜两大政治任务的紧急指示。县委书记已到各区督促检查购棉储棉工作的开展。
