[Report from our newspaper] After the notification from the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Administration Council of the Central People's Government regarding the strict inspection of basic construction project designs was issued on June 19, some enterprise-managing organs and construction units have earnestly arranged or prepared to inspect the status of basic construction projects; however, some leading organs still do not pay enough attention to this.

The Central Ministry of Textile Industry issued a notice on July 4, ordering all bureaus and factories under its jurisdiction to conduct discussions and inspections based on the notification. On June 29, the ministry also issued instructions to its subordinate units regarding precautions for basic construction work, providing specific instructions on personnel organization, material management, reporting systems, and security issues during construction. The Central Ministry of Light Industry, learning from the failure of the sewage project at the Beijing Paper Mill under its jurisdiction, had its Paper Industry Administration Bureau issue a notice on June 23, instructing all affiliated and trusteed factories to seriously study and inspect in conjunction with the second quarter work summary.

The Central Ministry of Heavy Industry has also decided to focus on discussing the ministry's basic construction issues several times within the next week.

The Beijing Municipal People's Government Construction Bureau issued instructions on June 29, requiring the Beijing Construction Industry Association to organize all construction units to conduct serious discussions and inspections based on the notification from the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Administration Council. The bureau will also convene a forum for design and construction personnel in the city to discuss various important issues existing in design and construction work. At the same time, an architectural engineering visit group composed of relevant organs and organizations will conduct key inspections of projects under construction. Bureau cadres will conduct study and discussions after the 11th of this month. The Beijing Municipal People's Government Sanitation Engineering Bureau, Beijing Public Yongmao Architectural Design Company, and other units are also preparing for basic construction design project inspections.

However, as of July 6, half a month has passed since the Central Financial and Economic Committee's notification was issued, and some departments have not yet conducted study and discussions in accordance with the notification, nor have they notified their subordinate bureaus, divisions, factories, and mines to conduct study and inspections. Some responsible comrades in some departments are still completely unaware that the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Administration Council has such a notification. The notification from the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Administration Council stipulates that the aforementioned discussions and inspections should be completed before the end of July. All departments that have not paid attention to this notification should quickly change this situation, seize the time, and lead and supervise their subordinate units to conduct serious discussions and inspections.

　　中央纺织工业部及京市建设局等部门
    开始进行检查基本建设工程
    有些领导机关应迅速改变不重视这一工作的现象
    【本报讯】中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会关于严格检查基本建设工程设计的通知于六月十九日发出后，有些企业主管机关和修建单位，已认真布置或准备对基本建设工程状况进行检查；但有些领导机关对此仍重视不够。
    中央人民政府纺织工业部已于七月四日发出通知，通令该部所属各局、厂，根据通知进行讨论和检查。该部并曾于六月二十九日向所属各单位发出关于基本建设工作应注意事项的指示，对修建工作中的人事机构、材料管理、报告制度、建设期间保安问题等作了具体指示。中央人民政府轻工业部接受该部所属北京造纸厂下水道工程失败的教训，已由该部所属造纸工业管理处于六月二十三日发出通知，指示所属及托管各厂结合第二季工作总结，认真进行学习和检查。
    中央重工业部亦决定于下周内着重讨论几次该部的基本建设问题。
    北京市人民政府建设局已于六月二十九日发出指示，要求北京市建筑业同业公会组织各施工单位，根据政务院财政经济委员会的通知，认真进行讨论和检查。该局并将召集市内设计施工人员座谈，讨论设计施工工作中存在的各种重要问题，同时通过各有关机关团体组成的建筑工程参观团，对正在施工的工程进行重点检查。局内干部将于本月十一日后进行学习讨论。北京市人民政府卫生工程局、北京市公营永茂建筑设计公司等单位，也正在进行基本建设设计工程检查的准备工作。
    但是，截至七月六日，中央财政经济委员会的通知发出已经半月，有些部门还未遵照通知进行学习讨论，也未通知所属局、处、厂、矿进行学习和检查。有些部门的负责同志，还根本不知道政务院财政经济委员会有这样一个通知。政务院财政经济委员会的通知规定，上述讨论和检查应于七月底以前完成。凡未注意这一个通知的各部门应迅速改变此种情况，抓紧时间，领导并督促所属单位认真进行讨论和检查。
