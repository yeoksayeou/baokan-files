  (7) Zhang Zhaoxun of the rolling mill second shift (a special agent who plotted to sabotage the large electric rolling mill) once went to the electric rolling mill and, while eating, asked about the structure and performance of the large electric rolling mill. Wang Tonglun refused to answer him, only saying, "I don't understand either."
    (8) In late April, the Public Security Bureau arrested Zhang Xueping, a counter-revolutionary who had been a major general staff officer for the Japanese and puppet regime and infiltrated the factory. This incident educated the workers and raised their vigilance.
  (9) The factory's Party General Branch secretary, through the Zhang Xueping incident, educated the workers, calling on everyone to prevent special agents from sabotage and retaliation, to defend the factory, and to defend national construction.
