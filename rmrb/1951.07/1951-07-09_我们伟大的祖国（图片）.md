    Our Great Motherland
    Beidaihe seaside is a good place to escape the summer heat, but in the past it was occupied by Kuomintang warlords and bureaucratic capitalists. The People's Government has now established many workers' sanatoriums here. This is a scene of workers swimming at the seaside.
