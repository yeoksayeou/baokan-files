To the Volunteer Army A Poem for the Volunteer Army
    Zhou Lianjiang
    Editor's Note: The following poem was written by Zhou Lianjiang, a family member of a soldier in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, to the comrades of the Volunteer Army. This poem has been widely circulated among the Volunteer Army.

    A wolf invaded Korea, cruel and shameless, defying morality.
    Outwardly strong but inwardly weak, Truman started a war and hurt people.
    Occupying our Taiwan and bombing our borders, dreaming of invading the entire world.
    Korea is the east wall of our courtyard; if the wall falls, the wolf will enter our hall.
    To protect our home, we must first protect our motherland; resisting America and aiding Korea is the right thing to do.
    You kill more enemies at the front, and the people of the whole country are honored.
    Do more work and hand in more grain, I am busy day and night for you.
    The front and the rear work together to defeat the American wild ambition wolf.

    周莲江
    编者按：下面这首诗是中国人民志愿军军属周莲江写给志愿军同志的。这首诗在志愿军中已经广泛流传。
    闯进朝鲜一只狼，残暴无耻丧天良。
    外强中干杜鲁门，发动战争把人伤。
    占我台湾炸我边境，梦想把世界侵占光。
    朝鲜是我东院墙，墙倒狼要入我堂。
    保家必先保祖国，抗美援朝理应当。
    你们在前方多杀敌，全国人民都荣光。
    多做工、多缴粮，我为你们日夜忙。
    前方后方齐努力，打败美国野心狼。
