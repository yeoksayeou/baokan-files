Xinhua News Agency, 19th. Soviet newspapers *Pravda* and *Izvestia* published commentaries denouncing the U.S. draft peace treaty with Japan. According to TASS: *Pravda* published an article on the 16th by Markov entitled "A Separate Peace Treaty with Japan—an Instrument of U.S. Aggression." Markov said: The draft "treaty" advertised by the U.S. State Department does not consider peace at all. The purpose of the drafters of the U.S. draft is to turn Japan into an accomplice of U.S. aggression. The U.S. attempt to force Japan to accept a separate treaty can not only maintain the current U.S. control over Japan, but also guarantee additional benefits that were not obtained during the occupation.

Markov pointed out: The aggressive nature of the U.S. separate peace treaty draft with Japan is clearly manifested in the chapter on territorial issues. The U.S. draft makes no mention at all that Taiwan and the Penghu Islands are an inalienable part of Chinese territory, seized by the United States through banditry, and should be returned to their rightful owner—the People's Republic of China.

Markov denounced the U.S. for undermining the legitimate procedures for concluding a peace treaty with Japan and excluding the Soviet Union and China from participating in the drafting of the treaty. He pointed out that the U.S. conspiracy to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan aims to turn Japan into a docile tool of U.S. aggression. In contrast to this conspiracy, the Soviet Union has consistently advocated the conclusion of a comprehensive and democratic peace treaty.

*Izvestia* commentator Kudryavtsev wrote in a discussion of the U.S. plan against the Asian people: The more frantically the U.S. ruling clique prepares to illegally conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan, the stronger the tide of resentment and anger against U.S. imperialism's policy towards Japan becomes in Asian countries.

The government of the People's Republic of China and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have expressed the will of their people, condemning in official notes the draft separate peace treaty with Japan illegally drawn up by the U.S. government, and advocating the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan. Statements made by the press and public leaders of other Asian countries also resolutely oppose the U.S. draft separate peace treaty with Japan. As for the attitude of the Japanese people, one fact is most telling: under police terror, more than two million people in Japan have signed petitions demanding the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan and the prevention of the revival of Japanese militarism.

The commentator pointed out: According to the intentions of the U.S. ruling clique, a separate peace treaty with Japan will make it easier for the U.S. to establish an aggressive system in the Pacific region to deal with the national liberation movements in South and Southeast Asian countries. *The New York Times* said: This aggressive system will be similar to the North Atlantic Treaty system. The people of all countries know very well how the U.S. imperialists use the North Atlantic Treaty to undermine the sovereignty and national independence of other countries.

　　苏联各报斥责美国把日本变成侵略帮凶
　　揭露美制对日和约草案侵略阴谋
　　谴责美国非法排斥中苏参加和约草拟工作
    【新华社十九日讯】苏联《真理报》和《消息报》发表评论，斥责美国的对日和约草案。据塔斯社讯：《真理报》十六日发表马可夫所撰的论文《单独对日和约——美国侵略的工具》。马可夫说：美国国务院所宣传的《和约》草案，一点也没有考虑到和平。美国草案的起草人的目的是：把日本变成美国侵略的帮凶。美国企图强迫日本接受单独和约，这不仅可以维持美国目前对日本的控制，并且可以保证在占领中没有得到的额外好处。
    马可夫指出：美国单独对日和约草案的侵略性，在关于领土问题的那一章里面清楚地表现出来。美国草案根本没有提到：台湾和澎湖列岛是中国领土的不可让与的一部分，是被美国用盗匪的方法夺去的，应该归还给它们的合法所有者——中华人民共和国。
    马可夫斥责美国破坏缔结对日和约的正当程序，排斥苏联和中国参加和约的草拟工作。他指出：美国单独缔结对日和约的阴谋旨在变日本为美国侵略的驯良工具。与这个阴谋相反，苏联则一贯主张缔结全面的民主的和约。
    《消息报》评论员库德里雅夫采夫在论述美国反对亚洲人民的计划时写道：美国统治集团越是疯狂地准备非法缔结单独对日和约，亚洲各国境内所产生的对美帝国主义对日政策的愤恨怒潮就越来得强大。
    中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府曾经表示它们的人民的意志，在官方照会中谴责了美国政府非法拟订的单独对日和约草案，并且主张缔结全面对日和约。亚洲其他各国的报界和民众领袖所发表的言论，也都断然反对美国的单独对日和约草案。至于日本人民的态度，有一件事实最足以说明——在警察恐怖的情况下，日本各地已有二百多万人签名要求缔结全面对日和约和防止日本军国主义复活。
    评论员指出：依照美国统治集团的意图，单独对日和约一定会使美国便于在太平洋区域建立侵略体系，来对付南亚和东南亚各国的民族解放运动。《纽约时报》说：这个侵略体系将和北大西洋公约体系相似。各国人民已知道得很清楚，美帝国主义者是怎样利用北大西洋公约破坏其他国家的主权和民族独立。
