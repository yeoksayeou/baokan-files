The Runheji Diversion Sluice Project, which controls floods in the entire mainstream of the Huai River, ensuring the safety of dykes, was successfully completed on July 20th. The first phase of the project to fundamentally control the Huai River is thus declared complete. This is a tremendous achievement in China's water conservancy construction.

The Runheji Diversion Sluice is key to controlling floods in the entire mainstream of the Huai River and a focal point of this year's Huai River control project. After the completion of this project, more than 7.2 billion cubic meters of floodwater from the Huai River mainstream can be retained in lakes such as Chengxi Lake in Huoqiu County, maintaining the flow of the Huai River at the Runheji Diversion Sluice between 3,500 and 5,500 cubic meters per second. This ensures that the flood flow of the Huai River below Zhengyangguan will generally not exceed 6,500 cubic meters per second. Therefore, it can currently ensure the safety of the dykes in the middle and lower reaches of the Huai River, reducing the disasters suffered by the people in the vast areas on both banks of the Huai River in the middle and lower reaches. When the upstream and downstream regulation projects of the Huai River are completed in the future, it can also play a role in regulating the floods in the middle reaches of the Huai River, fundamentally freeing the people on both banks of the Huai River from water disasters and developing water conservancy.

The entire construction process of the diversion sluice was also a process of continuous overcoming of difficulties by tens of thousands of engineers, cadres, workers, and laborers. The entire sluice is 1,300 meters wide, 200 meters long, with a total area of 260,000 square meters. The sluice base and body require more than 20,000 cubic meters of concrete, and the entire project requires more than 200,000 tons of various equipment and materials such as yellow sand, gravel, and steel bars. Just transporting such a large batch of materials from all over the country to the construction site in a timely manner required an extremely complex transportation system and a large transportation force. Coupled with the fact that the construction time was only more than three months, and the engineers, cadres, workers, and laborers all lacked experience, there were therefore many great difficulties. However, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, with the help of Soviet experts, and with the support of the people of the whole country, these difficulties were finally overcome. The huge diversion sluice was completed as scheduled in just over three months. This is a miracle in the construction of new China.

In order to celebrate the victory, the Runheji Sluice Dam Project Headquarters held a celebration rally of 40,000 people at the end of the project, and 800 meritorious personnel were rewarded at the meeting. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　控制整个淮河干流洪水，保障堤防安全
　  润河集分水闸工程胜利完工  根治淮河的第一期工程宣告全部完成
    控制淮河干流洪水的润河集分水闸工程已于七月二十日胜利完工。根治淮河的第一期工程至此宣告完成。这是我国水利建设上一个巨大的成就。
    润河集分水闸是控制整个淮河干流洪水的关键，也是今年治淮工程的重点。这一工程完成后，可将淮河干流七十二亿多立方公尺的洪水拦蓄在霍邱县的城西等湖中，使淮河在润河集分水闸的流量保持在三千五百秒立方公尺到五千五百秒立方公尺之间，这样就可以保证淮河在正阳关以下的洪水流量基本上不超过六千五百秒立方公尺。因此，它在目前即可以保障淮河中下游堤防的安全，减轻淮河中下游两岸广大地区人民所受的灾害；待将来淮河上下游整治工程完成后，它还可以起着调节淮河中游洪水的作用，使淮河两岸人民根本免除水患，并可发展水利。
    整个分水闸的建造过程，也是数万工程人员、干部、工人和民工们不断克服困难的过程。全闸计宽一千三百公尺，长二百公尺，总面积二十六万平方公尺。闸基、闸身需用混凝土两万公方以上，全部工程共需用黄砂、石子、钢筋等各种器材物资达二十多万吨。单单把这样大批的物资及时从全国各地运到工地上，就需有一个极其复杂的运输系统和庞大的运输力量。加以施工时间仅有三个多月，工程人员、干部、工人、民工等全都缺乏经验，因此，困难是很多很大的。但是在毛主席的领导下，在苏联专家的帮助下，在全国人民的支援下，这些困难终于都被克服了，巨大的分水闸毕竟在三个多月内如期修建完成了，这是新中国建设中的奇迹。
    为了庆祝胜利，润河集闸坝工程指挥部在工程结束时曾召开了一个四万人的庆功大会，有八百个有功人员在大会上受到奖励。  （新华社）
