　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd: Nenni, Chairman of the Italian National Peace Council, published an article in *Pravda*, commenting on the Italian people's struggle for peace.

　　Nenni first pointed out: The Christian Democratic group dragged Italy into the "Marshall Plan" and the North Atlantic Treaty, which the United States is preparing to create another world war, causing Italy's economy to fall into a deep crisis and causing millions of people across the country to fall into unemployment and extreme poverty. In this way, the struggle for peace is increasingly closely linked with the struggle for life and bread.

　　Nenni then said: For several months, Italy has seen continuous large-scale strikes. Even university professors, middle school teachers, and civil servants of major government agencies, social strata who have never participated in the anti-exploitation struggle, have also gone on strike. Seventeen million people in Italy signed the Stockholm Appeal, and various democratic parties won great victories in the recent local autonomous organization elections. All this shows that the masses' awareness is increasing day by day, and their desire for peace is becoming stronger and stronger.

　　Nenni finally talked about the enthusiastic development of the movement to collect signatures for the Declaration for a Peace Pact in Italy, saying: Millions of Italians have already signed the declaration. Hundreds of new peace committees have been established throughout the country. The activists in these committees have deepened the signature campaign to every street and every family. Now, in Rome alone, 350,000 people have signed and 560 peace committees have been established; in Naples and Naples Province, 400,000 people have signed; in Livorno, every enterprise has established a peace committee, and people are engaged in a heroic struggle against turning the port into an American military base. In other places, the signature campaign is also being carried out victoriously. Nenni emphasized that the people's rapid and active response to the call for signatures shows that the Italian people's movement for peace has become more mass-oriented and militant in recent months.

　　南尼论意大利和平运动
    人民争取和平的运动最近更具有群众性和战斗性
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科三日讯：意大利全国和平理事会主席南尼在《真理报》发表文章，评论意大利人民争取和平的斗争。
    南尼首先指出：基督教民主党集团把意大利拖入了美国准备制造另一次世界大战的“马歇尔计划”和北大西洋公约，使得意大利经济陷入了深重的危机，使得全国有好几百万人陷于失业与极端贫穷。这样，争取和平的斗争就越来越紧密地和争取生活和面包的斗争结合在一起了。
    南尼接着说：几个月以来，意大利连续发生了大规模的罢工，连大学教授、中学教员和政府各主要机关的公务员这些从来不曾参加过反剥削斗争的社会阶层，也纷纷举行罢工。意大利有一千七百万人在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名，各民主党派在最近举行的地方自治机构选举中又获得了伟大的胜利。这一切都说明了人民群众的觉悟一天天提高，他们对和平的渴望已越来越强烈。
    南尼最后谈到为和平公约宣言征集签名的运动在意大利热烈开展的情形说：千千万万意大利人已经在宣言上签了名。全国各地又成立了好几百个新的和平委员会，这些委员会中的积极分子使签名运动深入到每条街，每个家庭。现在，仅罗马一地就有三十五万人签了名，并且成立了五百六十个和平委员会；在那不勒斯市和那不勒斯省，有四十万人签了名；在里窝那，每个企业都成立了和平委员会，人们在进行英雄的斗争，反对把这个港口变成美国军事基地。在别的地方，签名运动也在胜利开展。南尼着重指出：人民迅速而积极地响应签名的号召，这表示意大利人民争取和平的运动在最近几个月以来已经更加具有群众性和战斗性了。
