Sell More Cotton to the State
Liaoning Province First-Class Cotton Growing Labor Model Yue Defu

My home is in Gengjia Village, Tenth District, Liaoyang County. I was very happy to hear the news that the state was implementing planned purchase and supply of cotton cloth and planned purchase of cotton.

Our family has been growing cotton for two or three generations. But in the past, under the rule of the enemy, puppets, and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, cotton growers could not afford cloth and had no clothes to wear. Our family of seven didn't even have quilts, let alone clothes. At that time, growing cotton not only meant paying rent to the landlord and "shipment cotton" to the Japanese devils, but also suffering exploitation by private merchants. One winter, near the end of the twelfth lunar month, our children and adults still hadn't put on cotton clothes. One day, I carried six bundles of cotton to Liaoyang City early in the morning, hoping to exchange them for a few feet of cloth to mend the children's cotton clothes. Unexpectedly, as soon as I arrived at the market, the private merchants began to drive down the price, and it wasn't until dark that I sold it, and six bundles of cotton only fetched the price of three bundles. Thinking about these things makes me sad!

Since liberation, the situation of "cotton growers unable to afford clothes" has disappeared. In the past few years, thanks to the state's help, our cotton production has developed considerably, and our lives have improved year by year, and we have been using more and more cloth. Before 1951, our family could only add an average of six or seven feet of cloth per person per year, but by 1951 it had increased to ten or so feet, and in 1952 it had increased to seventeen or eighteen feet. Now, calculating it, we can add twenty feet of cloth per person per year. We are truly wearing warmer and better clothes year by year.

In the current situation, is it okay for the state not to implement the unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth and the unified purchase of cotton? No matter how I think about it, I don't think it will work. Take our family's situation as an example, we buy more cloth every year, but the amount of cotton produced each year doesn't increase much. In 1950, we picked 350 jin of cotton per mu of cotton field. In 1951, it increased to 380 jin. In 1952, because of the poor harvest, we only picked 290 jin per mu. In 1953, it recovered to 340 jin. In this way, the increase in cotton production cannot keep up with the increase in demand. How can the state not implement the unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth? If the state does not implement the unified purchase of cotton, it will not work either. Like in the past two years, every year at this time, cotton peddlers would come to the village in twos and threes to try to buy cotton, saying they would give more money, but in fact, they would lower the price of first-class cotton to second-class cotton. In this way, not only do we cotton growers suffer losses when selling cotton, but private merchants hoard all the cotton, which affects the production of the state's cotton textile factories even more. If the factory produces less, we will not be able to wear enough cheap cloth.

I am the director of an agricultural production cooperative. In order to support the unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth and the unified purchase of cotton, in addition to actively publicizing the significance of the state's implementation of this policy to the masses in the village, so that everyone will sell cotton to the state, I must also lead the members of our cooperative to carefully prune the plants, cultivate the autumn ridges, and remove large weeds, and strive to have each cotton plant bloom two more bolls before the frost. The 170 mu of cotton fields in the entire cooperative can pick an additional 15,000 jin of pre-frost cotton to sell to the state.

### 把更多的棉花卖给国家

    把更多的棉花卖给国家
    辽宁省一等植棉劳动模范　岳德孚
    我家住在辽阳县第十区耿家村。我听到国家实行棉布计划收购、计划供应和棉花计划收购的消息以后，心里很高兴。
    我们家已经种了两三辈子棉花。可是在过去敌伪和蒋贼统治时代，种棉花的人却买不起布，穿不上衣裳。我们全家七口人，连被子都没有，穿的就更不用说了。那时候，种棉花不但要给地主缴租，给鬼子缴“出荷棉”，还要受私商的剥削。有一年冬天，快到腊月底了，我们家孩子大人还没有穿上棉衣裳。有一天，我背了六捆棉花起大早到辽阳市去卖，想换几尺布给孩子添补一下棉衣。没想到一到市场，私商就压起价来，直到天黑才卖出去，六捆棉花只卖了三捆的钱。想起这些事情来，真叫人难过！
    自从解放以后，“种棉人穿不上衣裳”的事情再也没有了。几年来，因为有国家帮助，我们的棉花生产有了不小的发展，我们的生活也一年比一年好，穿用的布疋就越来越多。在一九五一年以前，我们全家每人平均一年只能添六、七尺布，到一九五一年增加到十来尺，一九五二年又增加到十七八尺，现在计算起来，我们每人一年得添二十尺布。真是一年比一年穿的暖，穿的好。
    国家在现在的情况下，不实行棉布统购统销和棉花统购行不行呢？我怎么想也觉得不行。就拿我们家的情况来说，买的布一年比一年多，可是生产出来的棉花每年增加的却不太多。一九五零年我们一亩棉田拣三百五十斤棉花，一九五一年增加到三百八十斤，一九五二年因为年成不好，一亩才拣二百九十斤，到一九五三年才又恢复到三百四十斤。这样，棉花产量的增加赶不上需用量增加的快，国家要不实行棉布统购统销怎么能行呢？如果国家不实行棉花统购，也同样不行。像头两年，每年一到这时候，棉花贩子就三三两两地到村里来套购棉花，嘴里说多给钱，实际上却把一等花压价成二等花。这样不但我们种棉花的人卖花时吃了亏，私商把棉花都囤积起来，更影响了国家棉织工厂的生产。工厂生产少，咱们也就穿不上足够的便宜布了。
    我是农业生产合作社主任，为了拥护棉布统购统销和棉花统购，我除了向村里群众积极宣传国家实行这个政策的意义，让大家都把棉花卖给国家以外，还要领导我们社的社员好好打尖打杈，放秋垅、拿大草，争取每棵棉花在霜前再多开两个桃，全社一百七十亩棉田就可以多拣一万五千斤霜前花卖给国家。
