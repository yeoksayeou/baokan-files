    My Thoughts on Implementing Vegetable Production and Sales Combination Contracts
    Ma Dezheng, Manager of the Tianqiao Vegetable Station of the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative

    This spring, the Tianqiao Vegetable Station of the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative signed fifty-nine vegetable production and sales combination contracts with organized vegetable farmers. Through these contracts, the vegetable station secured a sufficient quantity of various vegetables, meeting the substantial vegetable needs of residents daily, and effectively combating vegetable merchants who were driving up prices, thereby stabilizing vegetable prices. Both producers and consumers were very satisfied with this.

    The Tianqiao Vegetable Station was established in August 1951. At that time, the basic tasks of establishing the vegetable station were: to organize and lead the market, to fight against illegal vegetable merchants, to stabilize vegetable prices, and to strive to meet the growing vegetable needs of the urban population. However, because the supply and marketing cooperative's vegetable station was newly established and lacked experience in operating the vegetable business, and because private vegetable firms had a large proportion of the market, the quantity of vegetables we supplied daily only accounted for a little over ten percent of the total market supply. Speculative vegetable merchants seized on this weakness and recklessly raised prices, adulterated goods, and stirred up trouble in the market, cruelly exploiting producers and consumers.

    Let's take the vegetable prices in the market at five o'clock in the morning as an example. This was the time of day when vegetable prices were the highest. Why? Because the vegetable merchants knew that this was the time when purchasing personnel from various municipal organizations, groups, and factory canteens, as well as the general public, were concentrated in the market to buy vegetables. They would then raise the vegetable prices to a high level in order to exploit consumers more. Especially when the market supply of a certain vegetable was small, they would do everything possible to "corner the market," and only sell when the vegetable price had risen to a certain level. But once morning passed and the purchasing personnel had left, the vegetable prices would immediately plummet, and the vegetable merchants would sell off their goods at low prices. Vegetables such as celery, fennel, and tomatoes were no longer sold by the pound, but by the pile or by the basket, which caused great losses for the vegetable farmers. In the past, whenever there were festivals or because of rainy weather, when the vegetable supply could not keep up, the market vegetable prices were even more volatile. For example, during the Spring Festival in 1953, the market price of Chinese cabbage quickly rose from 400 yuan per pound to more than 1,000 yuan. In late August of the same year, due to continuous rain, the vegetable supply was insufficient, and the prices of many vegetables increased by three or four times.

    Of course, in the past, the vegetable station had also made great efforts to stabilize vegetable prices and combat speculative vegetable merchants. For example, in 1952 and 1953, in order to expand the supply, my station had also established additional retail outlets, but because our vegetable station controlled too little of the supply, our ability to lead and control the market was still small. In addition, private vegetable merchants and firms adopted various cunning means to create rumors and provoke our relationship with producers and consumers. They told farmers that the cooperative's vegetable station's price limits were preventing farmers from earning more money. In order to monopolize the market, they secretly intercepted and purchased vegetables from farmers on the road. In order to drive up vegetable prices, they bought and sold on different sides of the vegetable market to raise prices and seek high profits. Under these circumstances, many producers and consumers felt that the supply and marketing cooperative's vegetable station did not play a significant role in the market and could not solve their vegetable supply problems, and they expressed dissatisfaction.

    After the vegetable station signed combination contracts with agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs in the first half of this year, we gained control of a large amount of supply, and our share of the market has increased. Now, the vegetables we handle every day account for more than half of the total market volume, and the price difference between morning and evening vegetables is no longer as large as before. What is particularly obvious is that vegetable prices are generally very stable during festivals. For example, during this year's Dragon Boat Festival, in order to ensure the supply, the vegetable station proposed an expanded vegetable supply plan to various agricultural production cooperatives on the eve of the festival, and each cooperative transported vegetables according to the plan. For example, the Xiaohongmen Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs rushed to pick eleven large baskets of cucumbers overnight the day before the festival, and agricultural production cooperatives such as Huangtugang also transported twice as many vegetables as usual, ensuring the vegetable supply on the day of the Dragon Boat Festival. For example, recently, due to continuous rainy weather, various vegetables could not be transported to the market for sale in time, and the vegetable supply was very tight, but the vegetable prices at our Tianqiao Vegetable Station basically remained stable. This is all due to the results of our implementation of vegetable production and sales combination contracts, control of vegetable sources, and planned regulation and supply.

    Although the Tianqiao Vegetable Station has achieved the above-mentioned results in implementing vegetable production and sales combination contracts and ensuring vegetable supply, we must not be complacent with this. There are still many shortcomings and errors in our work. Many of the cadres in the vegetable station are transferred from vegetable merchants, and they still have varying degrees of capitalist business thinking, and the principle of serving producers and consumers has not been implemented well enough. For example, we have not yet effectively implemented the pricing policy of "superior grade, superior price" and "pricing according to quality" in the pricing of vegetables for the supplying units, and there are still some procedures that are not convenient enough for the purchasing units. These need to be further improved. We believe that with the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement of vegetable farmers in the suburbs, the signing of vegetable production and sales combination contracts between the vegetable station and the organized vegetable farmers will continue to expand. We will definitely ensure that the capital's vegetable supply work is done well.

    我对实行蔬菜产销结合合同的感想
    北京市供销合作总社天桥菜站经理　马德政
    今年春天，北京市供销合作总社天桥菜站和组织起来的菜农签订了五十九份蔬菜产销结合合同。通过产销结合合同，菜站掌握了足够数量的各种蔬菜，每天供应着居民大量蔬菜需要，有力地同哄抬菜价的菜商进行斗争，稳定了蔬菜价格。广大的生产者和消费者对此都非常满意。
    天桥菜站是从一九五一年八月建立的，当时成立菜站的基本任务是：组织和领导市场，同不法菜商作斗争，平稳菜价，力求满足城市人民日益增长的蔬菜需要。但因供销合作社菜站刚刚成立，对经营蔬菜业务缺乏经验，同时私人菜行经营比重很大，我们每天供应蔬菜数量只占整个市场供应数量的百分之十几，投机倒把的菜商们，就抓住了这一弱点，在市场上妄自提价抬价、掺水使假、兴风作浪，对生产者和消费者进行残酷的剥削。
    我们拿早晨五点钟市场的菜价来说吧，这是一天中蔬菜价格最高的时候，为什么呢？因为菜商们知道，这正是市内各机关、团体、工厂管伙食的采购人员和广大市民集中到市场买菜的时候，他们便把菜价提得高高的，以便更多地剥削消费者。特别是当某种蔬菜上市量少时，他们更是千方百计地
  “蹩行市”，直到菜价涨到一定程度时，他们才出售。但当早晨一过，采购人员都走了时，蔬菜价格就立刻大跌，菜商们就低价大甩卖，像芹菜、茴香、西红柿等，就不是论斤卖了，而是论堆论筐卖，这就使菜农受到很大损失。过去，每逢节日或因阴雨，蔬菜供应不上，市场蔬菜价格更是变化无常，如在一九五三年春节时，市场白菜由每斤四百元迅速涨到一千多元，同年八月下旬因连续下雨，蔬菜供应不及，许多蔬菜涨价达三、四倍。
    当然，过去菜站为了平稳菜价，打击投机菜商，也曾作了很大努力。譬如我站在一九五二年和一九五三年两年中，为了扩大供应，还曾另外建立门市部，但都由于我们菜站掌握货源少，因而领导和控制市场的力量还小。加以私人菜商、菜行采取各种狡猾手段，制造谣言，挑拨我们和生产者、消费者的关系。他们向农民说，合作社菜站限价是不让农民多赚钱；他们为了垄断市场，偷偷摸摸地在半路上向农民截购蔬菜。他们为了哄抬菜价，在菜市上东边买西边卖，以便抬高价格后，谋取高额利润。在这种情况下，许多生产者和消费者都感到供销合作社菜站在市场上所起作用不大，不能为他们解决蔬菜供应问题，表示不满。
    菜站今年上半年和郊区农业生产合作社签订结合合同后，我们掌握了大批货源，市场上经营比重增加了，现在每天经营蔬菜占整个市场经营数量在一半以上，蔬菜早晚价格也不再像以前悬殊了。尤其明显的，每逢节日，菜价一般都很平稳，如今年端午节时，菜站为了保证供应，就在节日前夕，向各农业生产合作社提出扩大蔬菜供应计划，各社都按计划运来了蔬菜。如郊区小红门农业生产合作社在节日前一天，连夜突击摘下了十一大筐的黄瓜，黄土岗等农业生产合作社也都较平时加倍运送了蔬菜，结果保证端午节这天蔬菜供应。又如最近因连续阴雨，各种蔬菜不能及时运到市场出售，蔬菜供应很紧张，但我们天桥菜站的菜价还基本上保持平稳的。这都是由于我们推行蔬菜产销结合合同、掌握了菜源、有计划进行调剂和供应所得到的结果。
    天桥菜站在执行蔬菜产销结合合同、保证蔬菜供应方面虽然获得了上述成绩，但我们决不能以此心满意足；在我们的工作中还存在许多缺点和错误。菜站的许多干部，多数是由菜商转来的，他们还存在着程度不同的资本主义经营思想，对为生产者和消费者服务的方针还贯彻得不够好。譬如对送菜单位的蔬菜作价方面还没有切实贯彻“优级优价”、“以质论价”的价格政策，对买菜单位也还有一些手续不够简便，这些都需要继续加以改进的。我们相信，随着郊区菜农互助合作运动的发展，菜站和组织起来的菜农订立蔬菜产销结合合同定会日益扩大。我们一定保证把首都蔬菜供应工作作好。（附图片）
