    Interim Measures for Accepting Mineral Reporting from the Masses by the Central Geological Department
    I. To mobilize and organize the broad masses to report mineral deposits, integrate geological work with the masses, and facilitate the discovery of mineral resources in our country, these measures are formulated.
    II. The masses may report any mineral deposits or mineral conditions they hear about or see to the Ministry of Geology or its affiliated Geological Bureaus or Sub-bureaus, Prospecting Teams, or Exploration Teams.
    III. To facilitate timely investigation and research, and to avoid affecting the production and work of the masses, it is generally advisable to report mineral deposits to the local Prospecting Team or Exploration Team nearby. If there is no Prospecting Team or Exploration Team locally, it can be reported to the local government for forwarding to the Central Geological Department's Geological Bureaus or Sub-bureaus in various regions (the East China region forwards reports to the Central Geological Department).
    IV. The content of the mineral report should include the following information as much as possible:
    1. Name of the mineral occurrence, location of discovery, including the province, county, district, township, village, small place name, and transportation conditions.
    2. Time and circumstances of the mineral occurrence discovery.
    3. The distribution range, shape, size, color, etc., of the mineral outcrop known to the reporter.
    4. Has it been mined or investigated before? What was the situation at that time? Are there any old tunnels, old ore piles, slag, etc.?
    5. Topography and other conditions near the mineral deposit.
    V. It is best to attach mineral specimens to the report for identification and research. When collecting specimens, collect some good ones, some inferior ones, and rocks that are associated with or near the ore. The size of each specimen should preferably be about two inches in length, width, and thickness, wrapped in paper (if it is a liquid, it can be put in a bottle), numbered separately, and the sampling location should be indicated according to the number to avoid confusion. If mailing, it should be packed in a wooden box or cloth bag and mailed together with the letter. The specimen postage and packaging costs can be reimbursed upon receipt of a written explanation and attached receipts.
    VI. Please indicate the reporter's name, occupation, gender, address, and mailing address in the mineral report letter for contact purposes. Write "Mineral Report" in the upper left corner of the envelope to avoid postage, which will be paid by the mineral reporting organization.
    VII. After receiving the letter and mineral samples, the results will be replied to the reporter after research and identification, and it will be decided whether to send someone to investigate based on the situation.
    VIII. If the reported mineral deposit is proven to be newly discovered and valuable through on-site investigation or exploration, the Ministry of Geology or the local Geological Bureau will consult with the local government to provide the reporter with active encouragement, including commendation, awarding certificates, prizes, bonuses, etc.
    IX. These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation upon approval by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government.

    中央地质部接受群众报矿暂行办法
    一、为了发动和组织广大群众报矿，使地质工作和群众相结合，以利于我国矿藏的发现，特制定本办法。
    二、凡人民群众所耳闻目见的矿产地或矿产情况，都可向地质部或其所属地质局或分局、普查队、勘探队进行报矿。
    三、为便于及时调查研究，并避免影响群众生产和工作，报矿一般以就近报给当地普查队、勘探队为宜。如当地没有普查队或勘探队，可报给当地政府代为转报中央地质部的各地质局或分局（华东区转报给中央地质部）。
    四、报矿内容应尽可能包括下列说明：
    1、矿苗名称，发现地点，其所隶属的省、县、区、乡、村、小地名和交通情况。
    2、矿苗发现的时间及经过情况。
    3、报矿人所知道的矿苗露头分布范围及其形状、大小、颜色等。
    4、以前曾否开采或调查过？当时情况如何？现在有无老硐、旧矿堆、炼渣等。
    5、矿产地附近地形及其他情况。
    五、报矿最好附来矿石标本，以便鉴定和研究。采取标本时，可将好的、次的及与矿石共生或矿石附近的岩石都采取一些。每块标本的大小，最好是长、宽、厚各约两寸，用纸包好（如为液体，可用瓶子装好），分别编号，并按号注明采取地点，以免混乱。如用邮寄，应装在木箱或布袋内，连信一齐付邮。标本寄费及包装费，来信说明并附单据，即可汇还。
    六、报矿来信请注明报矿人的姓名、职业、性别、住址及通讯处，以便联系。信封左上角写
  “报矿”两字，即可免贴邮票，由主办报矿机构总付。
    七、收到来信及矿样，经过研究和鉴定后，即将结果回复报矿人，并得视情况决定是否派人前往调查。
    八、所报矿产地，经实地调查或勘探，证明为新发现和有价值时，由地质部或各地质局会同当地政府商定给报矿人以积极鼓励，包括表扬，发给奖状、奖品、奖金等。
    九、本办法经中央人民政府政务院批准自公布之日起施行。
