Xinhua News Agency, 31st:

The Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party issued instructions to its local organizations at all levels, calling on all members of the Zhi Gong Party to earnestly study and publicize the Joint Declaration of all democratic parties and people's organizations of the People's Republic of China for the liberation of Taiwan. The instructions stated that all members of the China Zhi Gong Party and the overseas Chinese masses they are connected with resolutely support the Joint Declaration for the Liberation of Taiwan, and solemnly signed the Joint Declaration. This declaration not only demonstrates the determination of our people to liberate Taiwan, but also points out the direction in which all the people of our country must work hard to liberate Taiwan. Every comrade in our party must participate in this sacred work with a revolutionary spirit and complete this great historical task. The instructions require that in this study, every comrade must correctly recognize that the liberation of Taiwan is an arduous task that must be completed through unyielding struggle, based on the analysis of the current international situation and our country's military, diplomatic, and domestic affairs. Every comrade must deeply recognize that the liberation of Taiwan will inevitably be victorious, and no matter what conspiracies and tricks the American imperialists and their running dogs play, the great cause of our people to liberate Taiwan will be victoriously completed under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, and with the united efforts of the people of the whole country. The instructions called on all cadres and members of the Zhi Gong Party to work hard in their respective positions, mobilize the masses they are connected with as much as possible, and use various methods to publicize the lenient policy of our Central People's Government to all those who are still living in Taiwan, and to persuade them to abandon the darkness and turn to the light as soon as possible, and atone for their crimes by performing meritorious service, so as not to cut themselves off from the people.
