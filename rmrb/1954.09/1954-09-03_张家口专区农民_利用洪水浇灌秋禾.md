Farmers in the Zhangjiakou Special District of Hebei Province are actively using floodwater to irrigate autumn crops. According to incomplete statistics, over 900,000 mu of autumn crops have been irrigated with floodwater throughout the special district. The crops grow well after irrigation. It is estimated that the yield per mu can be increased by more than 50 jin compared to unirrigated autumn crops. This year, all regions have been paying attention to improving irrigation techniques, implementing shallow and frequent irrigation methods. In Xuanhua County, of the more than 200,000 mu irrigated with floodwater, more than 50,000 mu were irrigated twice, and more than 2,500 mu were irrigated three times. As a result, the fields have been silted up with a layer of fertile new soil one or two cun thick, which will not only increase production this year but also create favorable conditions for increasing production next year. At present, various regions are continuing to use floodwater to irrigate autumn crops. It is estimated that over 1.2 million mu can be irrigated throughout the special district. This alone can increase grain production by 62 million jin this year.

    张家口专区农民
    利用洪水浇灌秋禾
    河北省张家口专区农民积极利用洪水浇灌秋禾。据不完全统计，全专区已引洪水浇灌秋禾九十多万亩。浇灌后的庄稼生长良好，估计每亩可比未浇灌的秋禾增产五十多斤。今年各地都注意改进浇水技术，实行了浅浇勤浇的办法。宣化县用洪水浇灌的二十多万亩内，有五万多亩浇灌了两次，浇灌三次的有二千五百多亩。因此，地里都淤了一、二寸厚的肥沃的新土，这不但今年能增产，也为明年的增产创造了有利条件。目前，各地还正在继续利用洪水浇灌秋禾，估计全专区能浇灌一百二十多万亩。仅这项今年就能增产粮食六千二百万斤。
