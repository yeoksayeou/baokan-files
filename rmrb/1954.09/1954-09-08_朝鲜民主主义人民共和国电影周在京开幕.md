From 'Reconnaissance Soldier,' we can see the heroic and resourceful image of the reconnaissance soldiers of the Korean People's Army; 'Anti-Aircraft Shooting Team' tells the story of how the soldiers of the Korean People's Army, in the Fatherland Liberation War, studied shooting techniques with infantry weapons and defeated the 'air superiority' boasted by American imperialism; 'Masters of the Land' records the exemplary deeds and victorious achievements of Korean farmers in supporting the front line with abundant harvests during the Fatherland Liberation War.
