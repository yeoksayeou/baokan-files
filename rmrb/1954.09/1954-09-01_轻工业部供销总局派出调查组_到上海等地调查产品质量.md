    The Supply and Marketing General Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry Sends Investigation Team to Shanghai and Other Places to Investigate Product Quality
    In order to understand the actual usage effects of state-owned light industrial products and further improve product quality, the Supply and Marketing General Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry dispatched investigation teams to Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang and other places in mid-August to conduct investigations.
    In this investigation, they will deeply understand the quality of main products such as automobile tires, newsprint, offset printing paper, cigarette bobbin paper, cement bag paper, short-wave electrotherapy apparatus, universal operating beds, sugar canned goods, and soap. They will also learn about the benefits that improved product quality brings to users, and the impact of reduced product quality on users. They will also extensively solicit user departments' requirements for product quality.
    The main investigation methods are: First, individual visits will be conducted, that is, they will go to various direct user departments to collect information on the actual use of products and solicit users' opinions on product quality; second, various symposiums will be held; and third, they will go deep into the field to understand the practical effect of the products.

    轻工业部供销总局派出调查组
    到上海等地调查产品质量
    轻工业部供销总局为了了解国营轻工业产品的实际使用效果，进一步提高产品质量，特于八月中旬派出调查组分赴上海、天津、沈阳等地进行调查。
    在这次调查中，将深入地了解汽车轮胎、新闻纸、胶版印刷纸、卷烟盘纸、水泥袋纸、短波电疗器、万能手术床、食糖罐头、肥皂等主要产品质量情况，了解产品质量提高给用户一些什么好处？产品质量降低对用户有些什么影响？并广泛的征求使用部门对产品质量的要求。
    调查的主要方法是：一是进行个别访问，即分赴各直接使用部门搜集产品实际使用情况，征求用户对产品质量的意见；二是召开各种座谈会；三是深入现场，具体了解产品实用效果。　（王保林）
