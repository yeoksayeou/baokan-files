    The Highly Developed and Comprehensive Soviet Industry
    --An Introduction to the Heavy Industry Hall in the Exhibition of Achievements in Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction
    By our reporters Pei Lan and Ge Xian
    The Heavy Industry Hall is the largest hall in the Exhibition of Achievements in Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction. Stepping inside, one feels as if entering the workshop of a gigantic factory.

    (I)
    Large-scale artistic pictures and charts hang on the walls of the main hall of the Heavy Industry Hall, illustrating the growth of Soviet production of oil, coal, iron, steel, and so on. In these pictures, we see: huge blast furnaces are spewing fiery red molten iron; silvery white molten steel is flowing out of huge steelmaking furnaces; steel rolling mills are filled with steel plates and bars; in a large-scale open-pit coal mine, combined coal mining machines are at work; the trestle bridges of the famous “Oil Rocks” oil field in the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic stand majestically. On the twelve exhibition platforms below these pictures, more than a hundred kinds of steel and mineral samples are displayed, including black and white steel plates, alloy steel sheets, iron wire, ball bearing tubes, stainless steel tubes, welded tubes, seamless tubes, boiler tubes, steam pipes, and so on. There are also heavy industrial raw materials and supplies such as iron ore, manganese ore, chromite ore, anthracite, and asbestos. The more than sixty kinds of petroleum products include aviation gasoline, automotive gasoline, solvent oil, diesel oil, lubricating oil, and so on.

    In 1953, the Soviet Union produced more than 38 million tons of steel, approximately equal to the total steel production of France, Britain, Belgium, and Sweden; produced more than 133 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, exceeding the total electricity production of Britain and France; produced more than 320 million tons of coal and more than 52 million tons of oil. The development speed of Soviet heavy industry is astonishing. By 1955, steel production will increase more than tenfold compared to 1913; coal production will increase more than twelvefold compared to 1913; and oil production will increase more than sevenfold.

    With so much steel, electricity, coal, and oil, plus a highly developed machinery industry, the Soviet Union provides all sectors of the national economy with modern equipment, enabling them to realize modern technological transformation.

    (II)
    The machinery industry is the heart of national industrialization and also the center of this exhibition. Upon entering the Heavy Industry Hall, the first thing one sees is various new types of metal cutting machine tools, electrical equipment, printing machines, and textile machines. Among the more than sixty machines, there are large machines weighing more than ten tons and small machines with very precise and complex structures. Metal cutting machine tools are the most numerous, accounting for about 50 percent. They are all very precise, automated, or semi-automated lathes, grinders, milling machines, boring machines, and so on. Among the twenty-six metal cutting machine tools, sixteen were produced in 1953, and ten are new products this year. Several lathes are particularly eye-catching. The 1A136 single-spindle hexagonal automatic lathe, produced in 1953, can process various bar materials into standard parts of various shapes. This lathe is fully automated, capable of automatic tool changing, automatic material cutting, and automatic feeding, resulting in high work efficiency. For example, loosening, feeding, and clamping materials take only one second, changing a tool holder takes only 0.67 seconds, and changing speed takes only 0.5 seconds. The worker operating the machine tool only needs to press a button, and the machine starts to sing like a symphony. The production efficiency of a single-spindle hexagonal automatic lathe is equivalent to the total production efficiency of eight to ten ordinary lathes or three to four ordinary hexagonal lathes. This kind of machine tool can only发挥发挥 its effectiveness in socialist countries; it cannot be adopted in capitalist countries with unplanned production. The Model 528 semi-automatic spiral bevel gear milling machine, stamped with the words "Produced in 1954," particularly attracts people's attention. This milling machine is indispensable in industrial production. It specializes in manufacturing various spiral bevel gears to supply the needs of automobiles, tractors, machine tools, and so on. It can automatically and continuously cut teeth until all are completed, at which point it automatically stops. This milling machine demonstrates the characteristics of the development of the Soviet machinery industry. The Soviet Union has many machine tools specially designed for manufacturing certain parts, which can greatly increase output and quality. The Model 395 optical profile grinder, produced in 1953, is a very precise machine tool. It specializes in grinding parts for precision instruments and can grind precision parts of various complex shapes. This grinder itself is equipped with a special optical device that can magnify the parts being ground fifty times and project them onto a 50-centimeter square screen. Workers can see on the screen whether the precision of the processed parts meets specifications.

    To the left of the main hall of the Heavy Industry Hall, various types of electric motors, generators, and oil switches are displayed, as well as models of two huge hydroelectric and steam turbine generators. The 72,000-kilowatt Dnieper hydroelectric generator and the 100,000-kilowatt hydrogen-cooled steam turbine generator are rare large generators in the world, but the Soviet Union had already trial-produced a 150,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator in 1952. The Soviet Union is now building a 400,000-volt ultra-high-voltage transmission line. China's largest ultra-high-voltage transmission line is only 220,000 volts, and the United States also only has a 287,000-volt ultra-high-voltage transmission line.

    Of particular interest to people is the electric seam welding machine created by the famous Soviet engineer Ignatiev. People can sew cloth into clothes, but no one has ever heard of steel plates being sewn together. The electric seam welding machine is such a machine. It has a mercury rectifier and a set of vacuum tube control equipment to control the size and duration of the current. When you adjust the current, you only need to stack two steel plates together and roll them through the middle of the machine, and the steel plates will be sewn together. The Soviet Union now widely uses this machine. It can seam weld 2 mm thick low-carbon steel, 1.2 mm thick stainless steel, and 1 mm thick hard aluminum alloy.

    Standing alongside the electrical equipment are four automated and semi-automated printing machines. The semi-automatic slug casting machine produced by the Leningrad Printing Machine Factory has a production capacity equivalent to the work of six to eight people, and the quality is even higher. There is also a fully automated three-knife trimmer, which can cut sixteen to twenty knives per minute.

    To the north of the printing machines, nine textile machines are displayed. Most of these machines are the latest products. Among the textile machines, there is a highly efficient AT-1754 fully automatic loom used to manufacture high-quality wool fabrics. It can automatically adjust the warp, automatically change the weft, and automatically stop. One person can supervise ten of these looms, while in China, each person can only supervise two. This machine has a high production efficiency, weaving 3.6 meters of wool fabric per hour. There is also a small worsted spinning machine, which takes up a quarter less space than ordinary spinning frames. The machine has a broken-end cotton suction device and signal lights. Its spindles can rotate from 7,900 to 14,000 revolutions per minute, and 1,000 spindles can spin up to 28 kilograms of yarn per hour. Soviet textile expert A.F. Bychkov, who also came to the Soviet exhibition to help install textile machines, said after seeing these textile machines: "I came to China in 1952. When I was in my motherland, I had not yet seen such new-style machines." The ever-changing development of the Soviet machinery manufacturing industry is all too clear here.

    The many machine tools that people see here, although only small and exquisite machine tools convenient for transportation, clearly show the high and comprehensive development of the Soviet machinery manufacturing industry. The Soviet machinery manufacturing industry was established and developed during the period of national industrialization, and it has achieved such great results in just over thirty years. By the end of the Soviet Union's Fifth Five-Year Plan in 1955, the machinery industry will increase 230 times compared to pre-war 1913. In 1953, the Soviet machinery manufacturing industry manufactured about 700 kinds of important new machines. The Soviet Kolomensk Heavy Machine Tool Plant recently manufactured a vertical lathe weighing more than 500 tons, which looks like a four-story building. The productivity of this giant vertical lathe is equivalent to 200 to 250 ordinary lathes. The Gorky Machine Building Plant manufactured a giant milling machine that is ten times larger than ordinary milling machines. It is fully automated, with more than 20,000 kinds of parts, but only one person is needed to manage the machine tool.

    (III)
    In the hall on the left side of the Heavy Industry Hall, fifty-three electrical measuring instruments, sixteen modern communication equipment, twenty-five railway and highway transportation equipment, and seven models of seagoing and river vessels are displayed. The DK3-70 type dispatch exchange, only as tall as an ordinary table, has a very complex structure, including an amplifier equipment, an electric horn, and an electric microphone. Large-scale factories and mining enterprises can use this exchange to talk to sixty workshops and offices at the same time. It has two lines directly connected to the offices of the factory director and chief engineer. The factory director and chief engineer can sit in their offices to dispatch and direct the production of each workshop and understand the production situation of each workshop. There are also two sets of wireless telephone transceiver stations, which can be used by collective farms and tractor stations 30 kilometers apart to talk freely.

    A construction model of an arched reinforced concrete bridge built between 1949 and 1952 is particularly eye-catching. This is the reinforced concrete bridge arch with the largest span in the world, with a span of 228 meters and an arch height of 34 meters. It has two layers of structure, with a motor vehicle road laid on the bottom layer and a double-track railway laid on the upper layer. There is also a huge bridge-building crane model. This crane can install or disassemble structures up to 45 meters long, made of metal, reinforced concrete, or wood, on the piers. The models of oil tankers and inland river tugboats installed in glass baskets are very beautiful.

    Exiting the north gate of the left hall, people can see many beautiful pictures hanging in the northeast corner of the Heavy Industry Hall, each picture showing the beautiful architecture of the Moscow subway stations.

    Going to the hall on the right side of the Heavy Industry Hall, people can see many precision integrators, computers, meteorological instruments, and optical instruments. The electron microscope is the most eye-catching, which can magnify from 200 times to 40,000 times. On the base of the microscope, there is also a camera that can take pictures of the magnified objects. The electric integrator is used to study the physical phenomena represented by differential equations. The speed of solving problems is very high. It only takes one day for the integrator to solve some equations, but it would take several months to calculate by hand. The integrator thus frees engineers, scholars, and college students from complicated calculations.

    Going south from the right hall, you will arrive at the south corridor of the Heavy Industry Hall. Many precision testing machines and various hardness testers are displayed here. The 50-ton universal material testing machine is fully automated. A longitudinal and a circular indexing machine can engrave precise scales on metal, glass, and other processed parts. The longitudinal indexing machine can engrave workpieces up to 500 mm long.

    高度全面发展的苏联工业
    ——介绍苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会中的重工业馆
    本报记者　培蓝　葛娴
    重工业馆是苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会各馆中规模最大的一个。人们进到里边，就感觉到仿佛走进了一个规模巨大的工厂的厂房。
    （一）
    重工业馆正厅两壁上悬挂着大幅美术图片和图表，说明苏联石油、煤、铁、钢等的产量增长的情况。在这些图片上面，我们看到：巨大的炼铁炉正在喷射火红的铁水；巨大的炼钢炉里流出了银白色的钢水；轧钢厂里摆了很多钢板、钢条；在一个规模很大的露天煤矿上，联合采煤机在工作着；著名的阿塞拜疆苏维埃社会主义共和国“石油石”油田的义架桥，巍巍地矗立着。在这些图片下边的十二个展品台上，陈列着一百多种钢材、矿物样品，有黑色、白色的钢板，有合金钢铁皮、铁丝，有滚珠轴承管、不锈钢管，有焊接管、无缝管、锅炉管、蒸汽管等。还有铁矿、锰矿、铬矿、无烟煤、石棉等重工业原料及用品。六十多种石油制品中包括有航空汽油、汽车汽油、溶剂油、柴油、润滑油等。
    苏联在一九五三年中，生产了三千八百多万吨钢，约等于法、英、比、瑞典四国钢产量的总和；生产了一千三百三十亿度电，超过了英、法两国电力生产的总和；煤生产了三亿二千多万吨，石油生产了五千二百多万吨。苏联重工业发展速度是很惊人的，到一九五五年，钢铁产量将比一九一三年增长十倍多；煤的产量将比一九一三年增长十二倍多；石油将增长七倍多。
    苏联有了这样多的钢铁、电力、煤和石油，加上高度发展的机械工业就给国民经济一切部门提供了现代化装备，使它们能够实现现代化的技术改造。
    （二）
    机械工业是国家工业化的心脏，也是这次展览的中心。走进重工业馆，首先看到的是各种新型的金属切削机床、电气设备、印刷机器和纺织机器。在六十多种机器中，有十多吨重的大型机器，有结构十分精确、复杂的小型机器。其中金属切削机床最多，约占百分之五十。它们都是结构非常精密的、自动化的或半自动化的车床、磨床、铣床、搪床等。二十六部金属切削机床中，十六部是一九五三年出产的，十部是今年的新产品。有几部车床特别引人注目。一九五三年出产的1A136型单轴六角自动车床，可以把各种棒料加工制成各种形状的标准零件。这个车床完全是自动化的，可以自动换刀、自动切料、自动加料，工作效率很高。比如松料、送料、夹料一共只要一秒钟，转换一个刀架只要零点六七秒钟，变速度也只要零点五秒。操纵机床的工人，只要一按电钮，机器就像交响乐似地合唱起来了。单轴六角自动车床的生产效率相当于八台到十台普通车床、三台到四台普通六角车床生产效率的总和。这种机床在社会主义国家里才能发挥它的效能，在资本主义国家无计划生产的情况下，它是无法被采用的。铸着一九五四年出品字样的528型半自动螺旋伞齿轮铣床特别吸引人们的注意。这种铣床在工业生产中是不可缺少的，它专门制造各种螺旋伞齿轮，供应汽车、拖拉机、工作母机等的需要。它可以自动连续切齿，一直到全部完工才自动停车。这台铣床表现了苏联机械工业发展的特点。苏联有很多机床是专门为制造某种零件而设计的，这样可以大大提高产量和质量。一九五三年出产的395型光学曲线磨床是一台非常精密的机床，它是专门研磨精密仪器零件的，可以磨制各种复杂形状的精密零件。这个磨床本身备有一套特殊的光学设备，能把被磨削的零件放大五十倍，投射在五十公分见方的屏板上，工人可以在屏板上看到加工零件的精密程度是否合乎规格。
    在重工业馆正厅的左边，陈列着各种类型的电动机、发电机、油开关，还有两台巨大的水力、汽轮发电机的模型。七万二千瓩的德湼泊河水力发电机、十万瓩的氢冷式汽轮发电机是世界上稀有的大发电机，但苏联在一九五二年已经试制了一台十五万瓩的汽轮发电机。苏联现在正在建设一条四十万伏的超高压输电线。我国最大的超高压输电线只有二十二万伏，美国也只有二十八万七千伏的超高压输电线。
    特别使人们感到兴趣的，是苏联著名工程师伊格纳奇夫创造的电力缝焊机。人们可以把布缝成衣服，但是没有听说过可以把钢板缝在一起。电力缝焊机就是这样的机器。它有水银整流器和一套真空管控制设备，用以控制电流的大小、时间的长短。当你调整好了电流，只要把两块钢板叠在一起，在机器中间滚过去，钢板就缝成一块了。苏联现在已普遍使用这种机器。它可以缝焊二粍厚的低炭钢、一、二粍厚的不锈钢、一粍厚的硬铝合金。
    和电气设备并立的还有四部自动化、半自动化的印刷机器。列宁格勒印刷机制造厂出产的半自动化铅条排字机的生产能力可以抵六个人至八个人的工作，质量还高。还有一台完全自动化的三面切书机，一分钟内可以切十六刀到二十刀。
    在印刷机的北边，陈列着九部纺织机器。这些机器大多是最新的产品。在纺织机中有一台用来制造上等毛织品的效率很高的AT—1754型的完全自动织机。它可以自动调节经纱，自动换纬，自动停车。这种织机一个人可以看管十台，而在我国每人只能看管两台。这台机器生产效率很高，一小时可以织三点六公尺毛织品。还有一台小型精纺机，它的占地面积比普通的细纱机小四分之一。机器上有断头吸棉装置和信号灯。它的锭子每分钟可转七千九百转到一万四千转，一千锭子每小时最高能纺二十八公斤纱。苏联纺织专家阿·弗·白契柯廖夫这次也到苏联展览会帮助安装纺织机器，他看了这些纺织机器后说：“我是在一九五二年到中国来的，当我在祖国的时候，还没有看到这样新式的机器。”苏联机器制造业日新月异地发展的情形，在这里看得再清楚不过了。
    人们在这里看到的许多机床，虽然仅仅是便于运输的小型、精致的机床，但它们已经清楚地显示了苏联机械制造业高度、全面发展情况。苏联的机械制造业是在国家工业化时期建立与发展起来的，仅仅经过三十几年的时间，就获得了这样大的成果。到一九五五年苏联第五个五年计划结束，机械工业将比战前一九一三年增长二百三十倍。在一九五三年中，苏联机械制造业制造了约七百多种重要的、新型的机器。苏联科洛曼斯克重机厂不久前制造了一种立式车床，体重五百吨以上，看上去就像
  一座四层楼房高的建筑物。这种巨人似的立式车床的生产力相当二百至二百五十台普通的车床。高尔基机械制造厂制造了一种比普通铣床大十倍的巨大铣床，它完全是自动化的，大小机件有两万种以上，但管理机床的却只需要一个人。
    （三）
    重工业馆左侧的厅中，陈列着五十三件电气测量仪器，十六件现代通讯器材，二十五件铁路和公路运输装备，还有七个海运和河运轮船的模型。ДК3—70型调度交换台，只有普通桌子那么高，构造却非常复杂，其中包括一套扩大器设备、一个电动式喇叭和一个电动式麦克风。规模巨大的厂、矿企业，可以用这个交换台同时和六十个车间、科室通话。它有两条线直接通到厂长和总工程师的办公室，厂长和总工程师可以坐在自己的办公室里调度与指挥各车间的生产，了解各车间的生产情况。这里还有两套无线电话收发电台，相距三十公里的集体农庄和拖拉机站，可以利用它来自由地通话。
    一九四九年到一九五二年间建造的一个拱式钢筋混凝土桥梁建筑模型，特别引人注目。这是世界上跨距最大的钢筋混凝土桥拱，跨距二百二十八公尺；拱高三十四公尺。有两层结构，底层敷设汽车公路，上层敷设双轨铁路。还有一个巨大的架桥起重机的模型，这架起重机可以在桥墩上装置或拆卸长达四十五公尺的、金属的、钢筋混凝土的或木料的结构。装在玻璃筐里的油船和内河拖船模型，十分美观。
    出左侧厅的北门，人们可以看到重工业馆东北角悬挂着好多美丽的图片，每一张图片都表现了莫斯科地下铁道车站的美丽建筑。
    到重工业馆右侧厅，人们可以看到很多精密的积分机、计算机、气象仪器、光学仪器。电子显微镜最引人注意，它可以从二百倍一直放大到四万倍。在显微镜的底座上，还有一个照像机，可以把放大的物体照下来。电动积分机是用来研究微分方程式所表示的物理现象的，解题的速度是很高的，积分机解某些方程式只要一天时间，要是用笔算，得花上几个月的时间，积分机就是这样使工程师、学者、大学生摆脱了繁杂的计算工作。
    从右侧厅向南就到了重工业馆的南廊。这里陈列着很多精密的试验机及各种硬度计。五十吨万能材料试验机，完全是自动化的。一台纵向和一台圆形分度机，可在金属、玻璃和其他加工件上刻出精确的度标。纵向分度机可刻长达五百公厘的工件。（附图片）苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会重工业馆内景  本报记者　高　粮摄
