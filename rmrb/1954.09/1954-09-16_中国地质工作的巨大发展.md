In early 1950, after the peaceful liberation of Yunnan Province, the People's Government sent people to take over the Dongchuan Copper Mine. This is a world-famous copper mine that was discovered in the Han Dynasty and mined in the Yuan Dynasty. Someone at the mine greeted the comrades taking over, holding a piece of ore in one hand and wild grass in the other, saying, "Dongchuan has such a good copper mine, but we still eat grass roots."

This is an accusation against the reactionary ruling class of old China.

In old China, rich mineral resources and national sovereignty were sold to imperialism. Imperialist countries spread lies such as "China is a country with poor resources" in an attempt to strangle the Chinese people's hope of realizing industrialization; on the other hand, they plundered China's mineral resources and reduced China to a colony. In old China, countless treasures were suffocated underground. More than 100 underground fires in the Datong coal field burned for a whole century. The placer tin in Gejiu Tin Mine was a rare treasure in the world, but it was washed away day and night by the endless mountain water.

In the face of this shocking scene, every Chinese geologist was filled with enthusiasm. They had also traveled thousands of miles, written reports, and looked forward to the future, but all their efforts became empty talk on paper. Geological work received little support. In the field, they often only had two or three students and a few iron hammers. In the office, they could only use a spectroscope or a rotating stage to look at thin sections of rocks and minerals. The lack of practical experience in various scientific and technical work caused China's geological work to stagnate for a long time. The few discoveries in more than 30 years were often shelved. Mr. Ding Daoheng, a representative of the National People's Congress, discovered a large iron mine in a certain place in North China in 1927, estimating the reserves at 100 million tons. In retrospect, this was a too low estimate, but the Kuomintang reactionary government at that time regarded it as nonsense and arbitrarily changed it to 20 million tons without any basis.

The People's Republic of China was founded, and the tragic era is gone forever. Geological science has been reborn. In the past five years, Chinese geologists have provided many important mineral data for national construction, changing people's understanding of China's underground resources.

For a long time, China was called a country lacking iron ore. The magazine of the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgy said: "Iron is the most lacking thing in China." Chinese geologists have also expressed pessimism. The "First China Mining Record" published in 1921 said that the national iron ore reserves, calculated at an average of 0.25 tons per person per year, "are only enough to supply for five years." The lack of iron ore is "obvious." The "Chinese Minerals" published in 1926 even believed that the national iron ore reserves, calculated based on the production and consumption rate of the United States, "can be exhausted within four years," and "the hope of my country's iron industry is very small."

In just five years, Chinese geologists have proved that China is a country rich in iron ore deposits, and have quickly and effectively provided the country with mineral data for two iron ore areas, namely Daye Iron Mine and an iron mine in a certain place in North China. Daye Iron Mine was judged 25 years ago to have "passed its heyday and the ore quality has deteriorated," but after more than a year of large-scale exploration after liberation, it showed its true value. The actual reserves of Daye Iron Mine not only exceeded the estimate of Japanese imperialism by several times, but also exceeded the national expected figure by 193%. The discovery of Daye Iron Mine and an iron mine in a certain place in North China will be forever recorded in the history of China's socialist industrialization.

China was also called a country poor in oil. Some magazines said: China "has almost no possibility of oil reserves." The conclusion of the U.S. Mobil Oil Company's exploration of the northern Shaanxi oil field from 1914 to 1916 was also "the reserves are not large." In the five years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, both theoretically and through field exploration, it has been proved that China is not only not a country poor in oil, but also a country with abundant oil, and the "small reserves" of the northern Shaanxi oil field have also been re-evaluated and will become one of the new China's oil bases.

As for the fallacies that China is a country poor in copper and China is a country lacking in manganese, etc., they have also been refuted one by one in the past five years.

Five years of work have shattered decades of imperialist slander, changed decades of people's views, and laid an important material foundation for national socialist industrialization. This is a great achievement of Chinese geological work.

In these short five years, China's geological work has also achieved unprecedented development. The geological work of New China has changed the historical appearance of solitary operations. The state has transferred a large number of cadres to the geological department and trained a large number of geological personnel and technicians. Before liberation, there were only more than 200 geological personnel engaged in geological work in the country. After liberation, the number increased year by year. In the summer of 1954, the students who graduated from the geology departments of various universities, geological institutes, and secondary geological schools reached more than 2,000. The state supports geological exploration work with all the latest technical equipment. In 1949, the China Geological Work Planning Steering Committee received only a few drilling rigs from old China. In 1954, the Central Geological Department alone had hundreds of drilling rigs in operation. Many prospecting methods that were rarely used in the past are being used extensively by the geological work of New China. Geophysical prospecting was a niche within a niche in the past. Now, the Physical Prospecting Department of the Central Geological Department alone has a team of hundreds of people. They are equipped with new instruments such as magnetometers, gravimeters, resistivity meters, and natural current meters, and have become a strong force in China's geological exploration work. Since last year, the Physical Prospecting Department of the Central Geological Department has also tried airborne magnetic surveys, opening up another way for China's geophysical prospecting industry.

Geological exploration projects are increasing year by year. In 1954, the exploration projects of the Central Geological Department increased by nearly double compared with 1952. In the past five years, from North Manchuria to the Kangzang Plateau, to Hainan Island, there have been traces of geological workers all over the vast land of the motherland. Many field teams have thousands of employees and have developed into giant modern exploration teams with complete types of work and perfect equipment. They have changed the old habit of seasonal work and work in the field year after year.

China's geological work has embarked on a broad path of development.

    中国地质工作的巨大发展
    范荣康
    一九五零年年初，云南省和平解放后，人民政府派人去接管东川铜矿。这是一个在汉朝就已发现，在元朝就已开采的，世界上著名的铜矿。矿上有人一手拿着矿石，一手拿着野草去迎接接管的同志说：“东川有这么好的铜矿，可是我们还吃草根”。
    这是对旧中国反动统治阶级的控诉。
    在旧中国，富饶的矿产和国家主权一起出卖给帝国主义。帝国主义国家一面散布“中国是资源贫乏的国家”等谎言，企图扼杀中国人民实现工业化的希望；一面掠夺我国的矿产资源，把中国沦为殖民地。在旧中国，无数的宝藏被窒息在地下，大同煤田一百多处地下火燃烧了整整一个世纪，个旧锡矿遍地的砂锡，是世界稀有的珍宝，却被长年不息的山水日夜冲击，随波逐流。
    在这幅触目惊心的景象面前，每一个中国的地质工作者都空有满腔热情。他们也曾经远涉千山万水，写过报告，瞻望过远景，但一切努力都只成为纸上空谈。地质工作很少得到支持。在野外，他们所有的，常常只是三两个学生和几把铁锤。在室内，只能用分光镜或旋转台来看一看岩石矿物的薄片。由于缺少种种科学技术工作的实践，使中国的地质工作长期停滞不前。三十多年中仅有的若干发现，也常被打入冷宫。全国人民代表大会代表丁道衡先生，一九二七年在华北某地发现一个大铁矿，估计储量一亿吨，现在看来，这原是一个太低的估计，但当时国民党反动政府却视为胡言，毫无根据地擅改为两千万吨。
    中华人民共和国成立了，惨痛的时代一去不复返了。地质科学新生了。五年来，中国地质工作者为国家建设提供了许多重要的矿产资料，改变了人们对中国地下资源的认识。
    长期以来，中国曾被称为一个缺少铁矿的国家。美国采矿冶金学会杂志上说：“铁为中国最缺乏之物”。中国地质工作者也曾表示悲观。一九二一年出版的“第一次中国矿业记要”上说：全国的铁矿储量，按平均每人每年用零点二五吨计算，“仅足勉供五年”，铁矿的缺乏“彰彰明矣”。一九二六年出版的“中国矿产”更认为：全国铁矿储量以美国之出产及消费率计算，“四年内尽可用尽”，“我国铁业希望实微也”。
    短短的五年里，中国的地质工作者证明了中国是一个铁矿蕴藏丰富的国家，迅速有效地为国家提供了两个铁矿区的矿产资料，这就是大冶铁矿和华北某地的铁矿。大冶铁矿在二十五年前就被判决为“已过盛隆时期，矿质已较变差”，但解放后经过一年多大规模的勘探，她才显示了真正的价值。大冶铁矿的实际储量，不仅较日本帝国主义的估计超过好几倍，而且也较国家预期数字超过百分之一百九十三。华北某地的铁矿，数量之大，含铁率之高，更是世界上少有的。大冶铁矿和华北某地铁矿的探明，将永远记载在我国社会主义工业化的史册中。
    中国也曾被称为石油贫乏的国家。有些杂志上说：中国“几无石油蕴藏之可能”，一九一四年至一九一六年，美商美孚油行勘探陕北油田的结论也是“储量无多”。中华人民共和国建国五年来，从理论上，从实地勘探中，都证明了中国不但不是石油贫乏的国家，而且是多油的国家，“储量无多”的陕北油田也得到新的估价，将成为新中国石油基地之一。
    至于中国是贫铜的国家，中国是缺锰的国家等等谬论，在这五年中也被一一击破。
    五年的工作，粉碎了数十年来帝国主义的污蔑，改变了数十年来人们的见解，为国家社会主义工业化奠定了重要的物质基础。这是中国地质工作的巨大成就。
    在这短短的五年中，中国的地质工作也获得空前的发展。新中国的地质工作改变了历史上匹马单枪的面貌。国家向地质部门输送了大批干部，培养了大批地质人员和技术工人。解放前全国从事地质工作的地质人员只二百余人，解放后逐年增加，一九五四年暑期各大学地质系、各地质学院及各中等地质学校毕业的学生即达二千余人。国家以一切最新的技术装备来支持地质勘探工作。一九四九年，中国地质工作计划指导委员会从旧中国接收到的只有几部钻机，一九五四年，仅中央地质部开动的钻机就有数百余台。许多过去绝少采用的探矿方法，被新中国的地质工作大量采用着。地球物理探矿在过去是冷门中的冷门，现在仅中央地质部的物理探矿处就拥有数百人的队伍，他们配备有磁力仪、重力仪、电阻仪，自然电流仪等新式仪器，成为我国地质勘探工作中一支强大的力量，从去年开始，中央地质部物理探矿处并试行了航空磁测，为我国的地球物理探矿事业开辟了又一条道路。
    地质勘探项目一年比一年增加，一九五四年中央地质部的勘探项目就较一九五二年增加了将近一倍。五年来，从北满到康藏高原，到海南岛，在祖国辽阔的土地上，到处都有地质工作者的足迹。许多野外队拥有数千名员工，发展成工种齐全，设备完善的巨型近代化勘探队。他们改变了季节性工作的旧习，长年累月地在野外工作。
    中国地质工作已走上了广阔发展的道路。
