Soviet Newspapers Celebrate the Opening of the National People's Congress Meeting

[Moscow, September 15th, by our correspondent Li He] On September 15th, the day of the opening of the first session of the First National People's Congress of our country, Soviet newspapers extensively reported on matters concerning our country. "Pravda," "Izvestia," "Red Star," and others published the communique issued by the State Statistical Bureau of the Central People's Government of our country regarding the results of the national economic development and state plan execution in 1953. "Pravda" published a dispatch from its reporter, Koren, entitled "China in These Days." The dispatch described the thoughts and feelings of the people's representatives, workers, peasants, and intellectuals, gathered in Beijing. "Izvestia" published an article by Sudarikov entitled "The Development and Consolidation of the State System of the People's Republic of China." The article stated: "Chinese laborers, in discussing the draft constitution, unanimously declared their determination to steadfastly advance along the road of building socialism under the banner of the Communist Party, consolidating the camp of peace and democracy led by the world's first socialist state, the Soviet Union. The strength and invincible determining condition of the new democratic China lies in this. The Soviet people, all just people in the world, are filled with profound respect and friendship for the great Chinese people and wish the National People's Congress of China success in its work." "Gudok" published an article by N. Nikitin, Master of Laws, entitled "A Historic Victory, Great Goals," introducing the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China. The article stated: "About three-quarters of the adult population directly participated in the discussion of the draft. Hundreds of millions of people put in their share of wishes, wisdom, and life experience. This is the true highest expression of the people's will." The article said: "Friends of New China in the world know that the constitution will further consolidate the young democratic country, the great cause of peace, and the friendship between all nations." "Uchitelskaya Gazeta" published an article by Fiduni, Master of Laws, entitled "A Great Event in the History of the Chinese People." The article also introduced the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China. The article stated: "The constitution of the People's Republic of China belongs to the type of socialist constitutions. At the same time, the constitution takes into account the characteristics of China's development throughout the entire transition period until the socialist society is built domestically." "The constitution of the People's Republic of China not only reflects the reality in which the Chinese people live today but also illuminates their path towards the great goal—building a socialist society." The article stated: "The adoption of the constitution of the People's Republic of China will become an event of great international significance. The constitution illuminates the path for all colonial and dependent countries' laborers struggling against feudal and imperialist oppression to break away from long-term enslavement and poverty." The article continued: "On the great festival of the people of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet people wholeheartedly wish their Chinese friends more new achievements in the economic and cultural construction of their beautiful motherland and in the struggle for world peace." "Selskaya Zhizn" and "Moskovskaya Pravda" also published similar articles.
