    The wish is about to be realized
    Tie Dasheng
    When the newspaper carrying the joint declaration of various democratic parties and people's organizations for the liberation of Taiwan reached an air force airport, the pilots and mechanics who were undergoing intensive training on the airport were immediately stirred. Every word in the joint declaration excited the hearts of the soldiers, especially the call to the People's Liberation Army, which greatly inspired everyone and made them feel the importance and glory of the mission. Everyone expressed that they would certainly act in accordance with the call of the joint declaration, "Strengthen political and military training, master modern military technology, carry forward revolutionary heroism, and strive for the victory of every battle until the complete elimination of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique!"
    After reading the joint declaration, Wu Baoshan, the deputy commander of a certain flight squadron of the unit, immediately recalled the conversation a leader had with him when he transferred to the Air Force. At that time, the leader repeatedly said: "Today, we have achieved victory on the mainland, but we have not eradicated the remaining bandits of Chiang Kai-shek. After Chiang flees to Taiwan, he will still make a desperate struggle. In order to liberate all of China, completely eliminate the Chiang bandits, and defend the fruits of the revolution, we must continue to fight in the future." Then he kindly instructed him: "Remember! To complete this arduous combat mission, we need the strong cooperation of the Navy and Air Force. After you arrive at the aviation school, you must quickly learn aviation technology with a combat attitude." Today, when he recalls the leader's instructions again, he feels even more cordial. After he went to aviation school to study, he encountered many difficulties in the face of complex science and technology, just like many comrades who came from the army, but whenever he thought of the leader's instructions, he felt that he was carrying a heavy responsibility, and the courage to overcome difficulties increased accordingly. He finally completed the study task assigned to him by the Party and the people. Today, when he thinks that his wishes and determination are about to be realized, he excitedly says: "When we were studying, we did not forget the liberation of Taiwan, and during training, we did not forget that Taiwan is waiting for us to liberate it. Now that the people of the motherland have issued a call to us, we must conduct training more actively, master the weapons in our hands more skillfully, and contribute all our strength to the complete completion of the liberation cause of the motherland."
    Yang Zhihua, the commander of a certain flight squadron of the unit, said excitedly: "During the period when the country is engaged in arduous construction, it is not easy for the Party and the people to cultivate young people like us who lacked cultural and scientific knowledge in the past into air force soldiers who can master modern aviation technology. Therefore, when the motherland needs us, we must resolutely complete the task of liberating Taiwan." On his proposal, the Party branch committee unanimously adopted a resolution to respond to the call to liberate Taiwan by successfully completing the current training task. This resolution, which reflected the requirements of all comrades, immediately turned into a force for action, and challenge competitions were launched between crews. They also unanimously expressed to the Party Committee of the unit: We guarantee to continuously strengthen organization and discipline and improve combat effectiveness in the current training, make full preparations ideologically and technically, and when the motherland issues an order, we will immediately enter the battle and cooperate with the Army and Navy to complete the task of liberating Taiwan.

    愿望将要实现了
    铁大陞
    当刊载着各民主党派各人民团体为解放台湾联合宣言的报纸传到空军某部机场时，正在机场上进行紧张训练的飞行员和机械员们立即被轰动了，联合宣言中的一字一句都在激动着战士们的心，尤其是对人民解放军的号召，更使得大家受到极大的鼓舞，感到任务的重大和光荣。大家都表示一定按照联合宣言的号召，“加强政治军事训练，掌握现代军事技术，发扬革命英雄主义，争取每一个战斗的胜利，直到蒋介石卖国集团的彻底消灭！”
    该部某飞行大队副大队长武保山同志读了联合宣言以后，立刻想起了当他转入空军时一位首长对他的谈话，当时，首长曾再三地说：“今天，我们在大陆上是取得了胜利，可是还没有把蒋介石残余匪帮斩草除根，蒋贼逃到台湾以后还要作临死的挣扎，为了解放全中国，彻底消灭蒋匪帮，保卫革命的胜利果实，今后我们还要继续战斗下去。”接着并亲切地嘱告他：“要记住！为了完成这个艰巨的战斗任务，我们需要海军和空军的有力配合。你到了航空学校后，一定要以战斗姿态，迅速地学好航空技术。”今天当他再次回忆起首长的嘱咐时，就更加感到亲切了。他到航空学校学习以后，在复杂的科学技术面前，他像许多从陆军来的同志一样，曾经碰到过不少困难，但每当他想起了首长的嘱咐，便感觉到自己背负着重大的责任，克服困难的勇气就随着增强了。他终于完成了党和人民交给他的学习任务。今天，当他想到自己的愿望与决心将要实现时，他兴奋地说：“在学习时我们没有忘记解放台湾，在训练中更没有忘记台湾等待我们去解放。现在祖国人民向我们发出了号召，我们一定要更加积极地进行训练，更熟练地掌握自己手中的武器，为彻底完成祖国的解放事业贡献一切力量。”
    该部某飞行大队长杨志华同志激动地说：“当国家正在从事艰苦的建设的时期，党和人民把我们这些过去缺乏文化科学知识的青年，培养成为能够掌握现代航空技术的空军战士，该是多么不容易的事，因此，我们要在祖国需要的时候，坚决地去完成解放台湾的任务。”在他的提议下，党支部委员会一致通过了要以圆满完成目前的训练任务，来响应解放台湾的号召的决议。这项反映了全体同志要求的决议，立即变成了行动的力量，机组与机组之间纷纷展开了挑战竞赛。他们并一致向部队党委会表示：保证在目前的训练中，不断地加强组织性、纪律性，提高战斗力，从思想上和技术上充分作好准备，祖国什么时候下达命令，我们就什么时候投入战斗，一定配合陆军和海军，完成解放台湾的任务。
