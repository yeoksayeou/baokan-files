Dear friends!

We are very honored and happy to be able to visit your beautiful and powerful country and participate in the celebration of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

The great Chinese people have achieved tremendous success in peaceful construction, and therefore they can celebrate the fifth anniversary of liberation and national construction with pride. The recently adopted constitution once again demonstrates the Chinese people's firm will for peace, and their willingness to coexist peacefully and amicably with all countries with different systems. At the same time, it clearly points out to the warmongers that the Chinese people are determined to defend the fruits of their victory.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people are advancing towards a happy future. Like the German people, they can always receive tremendous assistance and support from the great socialist country, the Soviet Union, on this road. American imperialism attempts to collude with its puppets—Chiang Kai-shek and the Adenauer traitorous clique—to undermine the peaceful construction of our two countries. I am convinced that the friendship between our two peoples will become closer in the common struggle against American imperialist interference and for the defense of national self-determination.

I would like to take this opportunity to extend the warmest congratulations to the government of the People's Republic of China and the great Chinese people on behalf of the government of the German Democratic Republic and all peace-loving German people, and express my heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese government for inviting us to participate in the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Long live the unbreakable friendship between the people of China and Germany!

Long live the unity and strength of the world peace camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live world peace!

    民主德国政府代表团团长博尔茨的谈话亲爱的朋友们！
    我们这次能够前来访问你们美丽和强大的国家，并且参加中华人民共和国五周年国庆典礼，感到非常光荣和高兴。
    伟大的中国人民在和平建设中获得了巨大的成就，因此他们可以怀着自豪的心情来庆祝第五周年解放和建国纪念。新近通过的宪法又一次表明了中国人民坚强的和平意志，表明他们愿意和一切不同制度的国家友好与和平共处。同时，宪法也向战争贩子清楚地指出：中国人民是有决心保卫他们的胜利果实的。
    中国人民在中国共产党和伟大的领袖毛泽东同志的领导下，正在向着幸福的未来前进。他们和德国人民一样，在这条道路上能够永远得到伟大的社会主义国家苏联的巨大援助和支持。美帝国主义企图勾结它的傀儡——蒋介石和阿登纳卖国集团，来破坏我们两国的和平建设。我深信，我们两国人民之间的友谊在反对美帝国主义干涉和维护民族自决权的共同斗争中将会更加密切起来。
    我愿借此机会代表德意志民主共和国政府和全体爱好和平的德国人民向中华人民共和国政府和伟大的中国人民致以最热烈的祝贺，并对中国政府邀请我们参加中华人民共和国五周年国庆表示衷心感谢。
    德中两国人民之间的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的世界和平阵营的团结和强大万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
