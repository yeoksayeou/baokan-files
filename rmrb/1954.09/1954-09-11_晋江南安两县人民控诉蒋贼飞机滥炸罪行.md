Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, September 10th: The masses in Jinjiang and Nan'an counties, Fujian Province, who suffered from the indiscriminate bombing by Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft, are angrily denouncing Chiang Kai-shek's heinous crimes of massacring the people and destroying peaceful villages, and expressed their determination to resolutely support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan and demanding blood debts from the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

On the morning of the 7th, Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft bombed and strafed Shijing Village (formerly mistakenly reported as Shilin Village) in Chenggong Township, Nan'an County, the hometown of overseas Chinese and the hometown of the national hero Zheng Chenggong, twice in succession. A total of seven people were killed and injured by Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft in this village, and five civilian houses were destroyed; the Chenggong Middle School (now Shijing Central Primary School), which was funded and built by overseas Chinese in memory of Zheng Chenggong, was also repeatedly strafed and hit by two bullets. The local people witnessed Chiang Kai-shek's atrocities, and everyone hated them with their teeth, and expressed one after another: We must liberate Taiwan, capture Chiang Kai-shek alive, and demand blood debts!

Wucuo Village, Yangxi Township, the hometown of overseas Chinese in Jinjiang County, was also bombed by Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft at about 5:40 a.m. on the 7th, injuring seven farmers and family members of overseas Chinese, and destroying nine civilian houses. Wu Mianfu, a family member of an overseas Chinese whose legs were injured in the bombing, said: "Chiang Kai-shek lures overseas Chinese youths to be cannon fodder overseas, extorts money from overseas Chinese, bombs overseas Chinese hometowns at home, and massacres family members of overseas Chinese. Our people and overseas Chinese across the country must work together to liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique." On the evening of the 7th, all the people of Wucuo Village held a meeting to denounce Chiang Kai-shek's atrocities, and unanimously expressed their determination to work hard in production and do everything possible to support the liberation of Taiwan. Shenhu Town, Jinjiang County, was bombed by Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft on the morning of the 7th, injuring one adult and three children. Chen Qingyao, the eleven-year-old son of Chen Yanhai, was injured in the head by the bombing. Chen Yanhai said angrily: "Before liberation, Chiang Kai-shek caught me to be a soldier, and I only came back after my leg was broken; after liberation, they robbed fishing boats and killed fishermen, making it impossible for us to go to sea to fish with peace of mind, and now they have injured my son. We must liberate Taiwan, and even if Chiang Kai-shek escapes to the ends of the earth, we will catch him back!" The fishermen of Shenhu Port unanimously stated: When liberating Taiwan, we must have boats when we need boats and people when we need people, and we will never give up until Taiwan is liberated.

The "Kaixuan" passenger and cargo ship of Xiamen Shipping Company, which was sailing from Xiamen Port to Anhai Port in Jinjiang County, was also attacked by three Chiang Kai-shek aircraft. Five bombs fell near the ship, and Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft dived and strafed the ship, killing and wounding four crew members and passengers. Chen Jinqi, a twenty-six-year-old construction worker, and his young wife, Chen Xiuying, suffered fatal bullet wounds. Chen Jinqi's legs were broken, and Chen Xiuying's leg was also broken. The People's Government immediately sent them to the hospital in Anhai Port for treatment, but Chen Jinqi eventually died from excessive blood loss. Before his death, he said: "I just got married recently, and Xiuying is already pregnant. How can I leave them? You must avenge me!..." The local people witnessed this tragic scene and said angrily: We must avenge the dead compatriots! Resolutely liberate Taiwan, eliminate Chiang Kai-shek, and prevent this tragedy from happening again.

    晋江南安两县人民控诉蒋贼飞机滥炸罪行
    【新华社福州十日电】遭到蒋贼飞机滥炸的福建省晋江、南安两县受害群众愤怒控诉蒋贼屠杀人民、炸毁和平村庄的滔天罪行，并表示要坚决支援人民解放军解放台湾，向蒋介石卖国集团讨还血债。
    七日晨，蒋贼飞机先后两次轰炸扫射南安县侨乡、民族英雄郑成功的故乡——成功乡的石井村（前误为石林村）。这个村庄里被蒋贼飞机炸死炸伤的共有七人，炸毁的民房有五所；海外华侨为纪念郑成功而集资兴建的成功中学（现为石井中心小学）也被反复扫射，并中弹二枚。当地人民目睹蒋贼暴行，个个切齿痛恨，纷纷表示：一定要解放台湾，活捉蒋贼，讨还血债！
    晋江县华侨家乡阳溪乡吴厝村，在七日上午五时四十分左右也遭到蒋贼飞机轰炸，农民和华侨家属七人受伤，民房九所被毁。两脚被炸伤的华侨家属吴绵伏说：“蒋贼在海外诱骗华侨青年当炮灰，勒索华侨钱财，在国内轰炸华侨家乡，屠杀华侨家属。我们全国人民和海外华侨一定要同心协力解放台湾，把蒋介石卖国集团消灭掉。”七日晚，吴厝村全村人民集会控诉蒋贼暴行，并一致表示要努力生产、尽一切力量支援解放台湾。晋江县深沪镇在七日上午遭到蒋贼飞机轰炸，炸伤一个大人三个小孩。陈烟海十一岁的儿子陈清尧被炸伤头部，陈烟海气恨地说：“解放前，蒋贼抓我去当兵，脚弄坏了才回来；解放后，他们又抢劫渔船，杀害渔民，使得我们无法安心下海捕鱼，现在又炸伤我儿子。我们一定要解放台湾，就是蒋贼逃到天涯海角也要把他抓回来！”深沪港的渔民一致表示：在解放台湾时，一定做到要船有船、要人有人，不解放台湾决不罢休。
    从厦门港驶近晋江县安海港的厦门轮船公司的“凯旋号”客货轮也遭到三架蒋贼飞机的袭击，五枚炸弹落在轮船附近，蒋贼飞机又向轮船俯冲扫射，打死打伤了船员和旅客四人。二十六岁的建筑工人陈金启和他年青的妻子陈秀英，遭到致命的弹伤。陈金启两腿被打断，陈秀英一条腿也被打断。人民政府当即把他们送到安海港的医院治疗，但陈金启终因流血过多死去。临死前他说：“我最近才结婚，秀英已经怀孕了，我怎能离开她们呢？你们一定要给我报仇啊！……”当地人民目睹这一悲惨情景，都愤怒地说：我们一定要替死难的同胞报仇！坚决解放台湾，消灭蒋贼，让这种惨事不再发生。
