(Our correspondent in Guangzhou, September 1st) The British Labour Party delegation, invited to visit China, left Guangzhou by train at noon today for Hong Kong after a 19-day visit and tour.

On the eve of their departure from Guangzhou, the Labour Party delegation issued a statement, representing the collective views of the delegation, regarding their visit to China. This statement was read by Mr. Philips, General Secretary of the British Labour Party, at a press conference.

After Philips read the statement, reporters from the Southern Daily, Guangzhou Daily, Guangzhou People's Broadcasting Station, and Hong Kong's Ta Kung Pao raised questions on how to further ease the international situation, how to strengthen cultural, economic, and trade exchanges between China and Britain, and what comments the Labour Party delegation had on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence between countries with different social systems put forward in the joint statement by the Prime Ministers of China, India, and Burma. Mr. Philips answered them one by one based on the spirit of the Labour Party delegation's visit to China statement. Philips also said that the statement just released has indicated the delegation's approach. After returning to Britain, the delegation will also submit a "comprehensive report" on their visit to China to the Labour Party's National Executive Committee. This British Labour Party delegation's visit to China was decided upon by the British Labour Party's National Executive Committee at the invitation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs.

The press conference lasted half an hour. Reporters from the People's Daily, Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong's Wen Wei Po, British Reuters, London's Daily Worker, The Times, Daily Herald, Manchester Guardian, Daily Express, and Daily Telegraph also attended the conference.

    英工党代表团离广州前举行记者招待会
    发表访问我国的声明并回答记者的问题
    【本报记者广州一日电】应邀前来中国的英国工党代表团，经过十九天的访问、参观，已于今日中午乘火车离开广州，前往香港。
    在离开广州的前夕，工党代表团发表了一个代表该团全体意见的关于这次访问中国的声明。这一声明是由英国工党总书记菲利普斯先生在记者招待会上宣读的。
    在菲利普斯宣读声明后，南方日报、广州日报、广州人民广播电台和香港大公报的记者就如何进一步缓和国际局势、如何加强中英两国之间的文化、经济、贸易交流，以及工党代表团对于中印、中缅总理联合声明中所提出的、不同社会制度国家间和平共处的五项原则有何评论等，提出了问题。菲利普斯先生根据工党代表团访华声明的精神一一作了答复。菲利普斯还说，刚才发表的声明已表明了代表团所持的方针。代表团回英国后还要向工党全国执行委员会提出一个关于访问中国的“全面报告”。按这次访问中国的英国工党代表团，是英国工党全国执行委员会应中国人民外交学会的邀请而决定派遣前来中国访问的。
    这次记者招待会历时半小时，参加招待会的还有北京人民日报、新华社、香港文汇报、英国路透社、伦敦工人日报、泰晤士报、每日先驱报、曼彻斯特卫报、每日快报、每日电讯报的记者。
