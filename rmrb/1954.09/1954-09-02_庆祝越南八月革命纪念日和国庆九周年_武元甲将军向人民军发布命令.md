Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, September 1st: General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, issued the following order on the occasion of the anniversary of the August 19th Vietnamese August Revolution and the September 2nd ninth anniversary of Vietnamese National Day:

Commanders and fighters of the national regular army, local forces, militia, and guerrillas throughout the country:

After eight or nine years of heroic and victorious resistance, this is the first time that our people and army have celebrated the anniversary of the August Revolution and National Day in a peaceful environment.

Nine years ago, shortly after the Soviet Union achieved a great victory and the German and Japanese fascists were eliminated, the liberation army units, self-defense forces, and combat self-defense forces of the Vietnamese people, together with all the people, under the wise leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Indochinese Communist Party, and the National Liberation Committee, rose up in armed uprising. As a result of the victory of the August Revolution, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was established. On September 2, 1945, President Ho Chi Minh declared Vietnam's independence to the whole country and the world.

However, the imperialist aggressors launched the war again, attempting to reconquer our country. Our heroic People's Army, first in South Vietnam, then in central and southern Vietnam, and finally throughout the country, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely carried out the resistance war for independence and unity, democracy and peace, and to defend the rights that the August Revolution brought to our country. In this great patriotic war, thanks to the infinite support of the entire people, our army has won greater victories one after another, and has become stronger day by day. Our victory at Dien Bien Phu and the other victories achieved in the campaigns on various fronts last winter and this spring are proof of this rapid growth of strength.

Thanks to the achievements gained in the victorious resistance war of the past eight or nine years, thanks to the support of fraternal countries and peace-loving people all over the world, and thanks to the correct leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, we have achieved a great victory at the Geneva Conference. Peace is being restored in our beloved motherland. Nevertheless, peace has not yet been consolidated, unification has not yet been achieved, and independence and democracy have not yet been completed. The American imperialists, the French warmongers, and their running dogs are now trying to undermine the ceasefire and disrupt the peace by all possible means, and create difficulties for our struggle for independence and unification.

Therefore, in order to realize President Ho Chi Minh's proclamation, I solemnly order all commanders and fighters of the Vietnamese People's Army on this year's August Revolution anniversary and National Day:

One, maintain and further consolidate the fighting spirit, enhance revolutionary vigilance, carry forward the tradition of heroic fighting and fearlessness of difficulties of the People's Army, and be ready at all times to fight to defend and consolidate peace, and to achieve unification under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese Labor Party, and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and to complete the independence and democracy of our people;

Two, strive to study politics, improve tactics and military technology, in order to continuously strengthen the strength of our army;

Three, strengthen the discipline of the People's Army and strictly implement the ceasefire agreement;

Four, correctly implement all the policies of the Party and the government, abide by the ten disciplines in the task of restoring the newly liberated areas, especially the newly liberated cities, and strive to help the people in the southern temporary assembly areas.

The Vietnamese People's Army, with the heroic tradition of the August Revolution and nine years of long and arduous resistance war, is determined to accomplish the glorious tasks entrusted to it by President Ho Chi Minh, the Party, and the government: the heroic Vietnamese People's Army is the strong pillar for consolidating peace, realizing unification, and completing the independence and democracy of the whole country.

General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army (signed)

    庆祝越南八月革命纪念日和国庆九周年
    武元甲将军向人民军发布命令
    【新华社一日讯】越南通讯社北越一日讯：越南人民军总司令武元甲将军就八月十九日越南八月革命纪念日和九月二日越南国庆九周年发布命令如下：
    全国正规军、地方部队、民兵和游击队的指挥员和战斗员们：
    在我们经过八、九年的英勇和胜利的抗战以后，这是我们的人民和军队第一次在和平的环境中欢庆八月革命纪念日和国庆日。
    九年前的现在，在苏联取得了伟大的胜利、德国和日本法西斯主义者被消灭以后不久，越南人民的解放军各部队、自卫队和战斗自卫队同全体人民在胡志明主席、印度支那共产党和民族解放委员会的英明领导下，一齐起来进行了武装起义。由于八月革命的胜利，越南民主共和国成立了。在一九四五年九月二日，胡志明主席向全国和全世界宣布了越南的独立。
    但是，帝国主义侵略者再度发动了战争，企图重新征服我国。我们英勇的人民军，最初在南越、其后在中越南部、最后在全国，同全国人民一起，为了独立和统一、民主与和平，为了保卫八月革命所带给我国的权利，坚决地进行了抗战。在这一伟大的爱国战争中，由于全体人民无限的支持，我们的军队获得了一次比一次巨大的胜利，并且一天比 一天强大了。我们在奠边府的胜利和去冬今春在各个战线上的战役中所取得的其他胜利，就是这种力量迅速壮大的证明。
    由于过去八、九年胜利抗战中所获得的成就，由于兄弟国家和全世界爱好和平人民的支持，由于胡志明主席的正确领导，我们在日内瓦会议上取得了巨大的胜利。和平正在我们可爱的祖国恢复。尽管如此，和平现在还没有得到巩固，统一还没有实现，独立和民主还没有完成。美帝国主义者、法国的好战分子和他们的走狗们现在正想以一切可能的办法来破坏停战、破坏和平并给我们争取独立和统一的斗争制造困难。
    因此，为了实现胡志明主席的文告，我在今年八月革命纪念日和国庆日庄严地命令越南人民军全体指挥员和战斗员：
    一、保持并进一步巩固战斗精神，提高革命警惕性，发扬人民军英勇战斗和不怕困难的传统，时刻准备为保卫和巩固和平而斗争，在胡志明主席、越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府的领导下实现统一，完成我国人民的独立和民主；
    二、努力学习政治，改进战术和军事技术，以不断加强我们军队的力量；
  三、加强人民军的纪律性，严格执行停战协定；
      四、正确执行党和政府的一切政策，在光复新解放区、特别是新解放的城市的任务中遵守十项纪律，在南部临时集结区中努力帮助人民。
    越南人民军具有八月革命和九年长期艰苦抗战的英勇传统，有决心完成胡志明主席、党和政府托付给它的光荣任务：英勇的越南人民军是巩固和平、实现统一、完成全国的独立和民主的坚强砥柱。
        越南人民军总司令武元甲将军（签字）
