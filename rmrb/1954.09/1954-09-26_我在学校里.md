    I'm in School
    Hao Jianxiu, National People's Congress Representative, National Textile Industry Model Worker
    Two years ago, I worked in the fine spinning workshop of the Qingdao No. 6 State-owned Cotton Mill. Now, I'm studying at the Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School attached to the Renmin University of China.
    Since entering the factory in November 1949, many things have made me feel the pain of lacking education. Our factory implements planned production. Various charts are hung in the workshop. People with education can see at a glance how much each group and each worker completes each day. But I only saw red and blue lines curving up and down. If no one explained it to me, I wouldn't understand anything. The workers in the group often elected me to listen to reports from leading comrades, but I couldn't take notes, so I forgot what I heard as soon as I heard it. After listening to a report for half a day, when I came back to relay it to the comrades, I ran out of things to say in just a few minutes. I was very envious of the sisters who were educated. The year before last, after going to the Soviet Union to attend the "May Day" International Labor Day celebrations and visiting some automated factories that required a high level of technical expertise to produce, I felt even more urgently that raising the cultural level of our workers is one of the indispensable and important conditions for accelerating the realization of national industrialization.
    After I came back from the Soviet Union, I was thinking about how to carry out spare-time cultural studies. It was at that time that the Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Committee in our factory told me that the Party and the government were going to send me to the Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School to study! I was so happy that I couldn't speak for a moment. I was born into the family of a porter. When I was seven or eight years old, my father tried everything he could to send me to school. However, because my family was so poor that we couldn't even eat enough, I had to be absent from school for months at a time, taking my younger brother to the cinder pile to pick up coal nuggets to help the family make a living. In the old society, I don't know how many times I ran to factories to find work, but I couldn't get in because I didn't have money to buy gifts for the managers. In the new society, the Communist Party and the People's Government not only gave me work to do, but also sent me to secondary school! This is something I never even dreamed of before.
    "Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School" was established specifically for us workers and peasants to rapidly improve our cultural level. This is an unprecedented event in the history of our country. Most of the students in our school are like me, having not read much before, and coming from factories, rural areas, or government offices and the army. Hang Peilan, representative of the National People's Congress and national model worker in the textile industry, is my classmate. Actually, not only in our school, but also in the preparatory course of the Renmin University of China, which is next to our school, there are many students who, like me, are from worker and peasant backgrounds. For example, Li Fenglian, who was elected as a labor model in the revolutionary base area as early as the Liberation War, and Chen Shulan, a national textile industry labor model, are both people I knew before.
    Our original level of education was lower than that of general elementary school graduates, but we are completing the courses that general middle school students take six years to complete in three years. When I was in the factory, I couldn't even calculate addition and subtraction with four-digit numbers, and I didn't even know the meaning of the word "tour" that the engineer used when helping me summarize work methods; but now, I have to study literature, language, geography, history, physics, chemistry, biology... ten subjects at the same time. The difficulty is considerable. But I am not afraid of difficulties, because the school helps us concretely through the teachers. Our teachers are truly working wholeheartedly to improve the culture of workers and peasants and to train worker-peasant cadres for the country, working hard and without complaint. In class, they always explain the textbooks in combination with our practical experience, making it easier for us to understand the content of the textbooks. In order to consolidate our learning achievements, they give us a quiz of about ten minutes almost every day, in order to promptly urge us to study. In their spare time, they do not hesitate to sacrifice their rest time to help us study individually. This summer vacation, Teacher Yang, who teaches us language, and Teacher Li, who teaches arithmetic, came every day to help me make up for these two subjects. Sometimes, their children had no one to look after, so they brought their children with them.
    The school pays great attention to promoting the spirit of love and mutual assistance among students, and organizes students with good grades to help those who have difficulties in learning. Last semester, I was always falling behind the progress of the group in arithmetic and literature, so the class sent comrades Liu Baozhang and Yu Changming to specifically help me. Comrade Liu Baozhang came from the Xinhua Bookstore and is very good at mathematics; Comrade Yu Changming was originally an electrical worker and has a special love for literature. It was under the patient guidance of the teachers and the help of these two that I was able to catch up with my classmates in these two subjects.
    The promulgation of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China encourages our enthusiasm for learning. Article 94 of the Constitution states that citizens of the People's Republic of China have the right to education, and the state establishes and gradually expands various schools and other cultural and educational institutions to ensure that citizens enjoy this right. In fact, in order to guarantee that we enjoy the right to education, the state not only specifically established accelerated secondary schools for us, but also continues to pay our wages during our studies to guarantee our family life and enable us to study with peace of mind. Under the care of the state, we have the confidence to achieve victory in our studies.

    我在学校里
    全国人民代表大会代表 纺织工业劳动模范  郝建秀
    两年前，我在国营青岛第六棉纺织厂的细纱车间做工，现在，我在中国人民大学附设工农速成中学学习。
    从一九四九年十一月进工厂以后，许多事情都使我感到没有文化的痛苦。我们工厂是实行计划生产的，车间里挂着各种图表，有文化的人一看便知道哪一个小组、哪一个工人每天完成计划多少；而我只看见红线、蓝线向上向下弯曲，要是没有人给我解释，什么也不懂得。小组里的工人们常常推选我去听领导同志的报告，但我不能写笔记，边听边忘，听了半天报告，回来给同志们传达时，只几分钟便没话讲了。我非常羡慕有文化的姐妹们。前年
  “五一”国际劳动节去苏联观礼，在那里参观一些要具有高度技术水平才能生产的自动化工厂以后，更迫切地感到：我们工人提高文化水平，是加速实现国家工业化所不可缺少的重要条件之一。
    我从苏联回来以后，就盘算着怎样进行业余文化学习。就在那个时候，我们厂里的中共党委书记告诉我说，党和政府要送我到工农速成中学学习！我高兴得一时说不出话来。我出生在一个搬运工人的家里，七、八岁的时候，爸爸曾想尽一切办法送我上了学校。但是，由于家里穷的连饭都吃不饱，我就不得不整月整月地旷课，领着我的弟弟到煤渣堆去拾煤核，帮助家里维持生活。在旧社会里，为了找活做，我不知跑了多少趟工厂，结果都因为没钱给经理买礼物而进不去。在新社会里，共产党和人民政府不仅给我工作做，并且送我进中学读书！这真是我从前连做梦也没想到的事情。
    “工农速成中学”就是专为我们工人、农民迅速提高文化而建立的，这是我国历史上破天荒的事儿。我们学校里的绝大部分同学都跟我一样，以前没读过多少书，是从工厂、农村或者机关和部队来的。全国人民代表大会代表、全国纺织工业劳动模范杭佩兰同志，就是我的同学。其实不只在我们学校里，就是在紧靠着我们学校的中国人民大学预科里也有许多同学跟我一样，是工、农出身的。例如早在解放战争中就当选为革命根据地的劳动模范的李凤莲同志，全国纺织工业劳动模范陈树兰同志等，都是我以前所认识的。
    我们原来的文化程度比一般高小毕业生的都低，但我们却在三年内学完一般中学生要六年才能学完的课程。在工厂的时候，我连四位数字的加法和减法都算不出来，连工程师帮助我总结工作方法时用的“巡回”两个字的意思也不知道；而现在，要同时学好文学、语言、地理、历史、物理、化学、生物……十门功课，困难是相当大的。但我不怕困难，因为学校通过老师来具体帮助我们。我们的老师真是一心一意地为提高工人、农民的文化而努力，为国家培养工农干部任劳任怨的工作。在上课的时候，他们总是结合着我们的实践经验解释课本，使我们更容易理解课本内容。为了巩固我们的学习成绩，他们差不多每天对我们进行十分钟左右的测验，以便及时地督促我们学习。在课余的时候，他们不惜牺牲休息时间，个别帮助我们学习。今年暑假，教我们语言的杨老师和教算术的李老师，每天都来帮助我补习这两门课，有的时候，他们的小孩没人看管，他们就带着小孩一起来。
    学校很注意发扬同学间的友爱互助精神，组织功课好的同学来帮助有困难的人学习。上学期，我的算术和文学两门功课老赶不上大伙的进度，班里就派刘保璋、于常明两位同学来专门帮助我。刘保璋同志是从新华书店来的，数学很好；于常明同志原来是一位电业工人，对文学特别爱好。我是在老师的耐心教导和他们两位的帮助下，这两门功课才跟上同学们的。
    中华人民共和国宪法的公布鼓舞我们的学习热忱。宪法第九十四条说，中华人民共和国公民有受教育的权利，国家设立并且逐步扩大各种学校和其他文化教育机关，以保证公民享受这种权利。事实上，国家为了保证我们享受受教育的权利，不仅为我们专门成立了速成中学，并且在我们学习期间，还照常给发工资，以保证我们的家庭生活，使我们能安心学习。在国家的关怀下，我们有信心取得学习上的胜利。
