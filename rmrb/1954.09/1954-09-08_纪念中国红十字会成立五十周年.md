    Commemorating the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Founding of the Red Cross Society of China
    Li Dequan, President of the Red Cross Society of China

    The Red Cross Society of China has reached its fiftieth year since its establishment in Shanghai in 1904.

    Half a century signifies the long and eventful history of the Chinese Red Cross. However, if we consider its formal reorganization into a public health and rescue organization on September 8, 1950, it is still young. It is growing and developing, full of newborn vitality, creating its own cause step by step.

    The original name of the Red Cross Society of China was the Shanghai Branch of the International Red Cross. It was renamed the Great Qing Red Cross in 1907. After the Revolution of 1911, it was renamed the Red Cross Society of China, formally organizing a board of directors and establishing a membership system. Since its establishment, it has attracted many kind and socially enthusiastic people to participate in its various activities.

    Thanks to the efforts of these individuals, the Red Cross Society of China has done some beneficial things for the people. From its establishment until the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan in 1937, it used donations and materials to provide relief to earthquake victims in San Francisco, USA, and Kagoshima, Tokyo, Yokohama, and other places in Japan; provided relief to refugees in Turkey and other countries, as well as European countries during World War I; and assisted overseas Chinese in Japan, Russia, Germany, and Austria to return to China. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, it also organized rescue teams, first aid teams, and rescue hospitals to rescue wounded soldiers in various war zones. During these years, the Red Cross Society of China also provided relief to victims of various disasters, established medical institutions to treat the masses, and conducted medical education, training some intermediate-level medical personnel.

    However, in the past years, under the control of the Manchu feudal emperors—warlords Yuan Shikai, Xu Shichang—and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the Red Cross Society of China was almost always busy dealing with various disasters and epidemics. Its activities were limited to incomplete relief, medical services, and rescue, all the way to providing coffins, burials, and establishing charitable graveyards. After the Anti-Japanese Allied Army of Changcheng rose up in 1933, the reactionary rulers of the Kuomintang began to manipulate and restrict it. In 1943, they further established a special party branch and political department of the Kuomintang within the Red Cross Society. In the early stages of the War of Resistance Against Japan, although some upright and kind Red Cross workers participated in the rescue work of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, they were quickly transferred back or dismissed under the suppression of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Due to the increasing restrictions and obstructions imposed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang on the work of the Red Cross, it was extremely difficult for those who truly wished to engage in Red Cross work to continue their work. The influence of the Red Cross among the people gradually weakened, and its activities stagnated.

    In 1949, the People's Republic of China was founded, and the Chinese people became the masters of the country, opening up broad prospects for the redevelopment of Red Cross work. With the development of national construction, people from all walks of life felt an increasingly urgent need to develop the Red Cross cause. Therefore, on September 8, 1950, through the efforts of a consultative conference composed of various relevant parties, the reorganization of the old Red Cross was completed. A new board of directors with broad representation was elected, and new regulations were promulgated with the principles of "prevention first" and "mobilizing and organizing the people to practice self-rescue and help others," declaring it to be a public health and rescue organization of the people. This decisive turning point brought new tasks to the Red Cross Society of China, and it began to carry out a series of tasks starting from the most long-term and fundamental interests of the people.

    From 1950 to 1954, it united the vast number of medical workers, organized various forms of medical and preventive service teams, and participated in various water conservancy projects to completely eliminate water and drought disasters. In the Huai River control project, the Jingjiang River flood diversion, and the Yellow River control in Henan, the South Dongting Lake renovation in Yueyang, the Chengxi Canal widening, and the Jinpen Yuli Reservoir, the Red Cross medical and preventive service teams demonstrated a selfless working spirit and contributed their strength. Especially in the great Huai River control project, they worked in the Huai River basin for four years. These medical and preventive service teams also actively participated in the construction projects of the Xiang-Gui Railway and the Cheng-Yu Railway, and are currently participating in the work of the Feng-Sha Railway and the Guanting Reservoir Hydropower Station. The Red Cross also went deep into factories, mines, and construction sites in large and medium-sized cities to work.

    Not only that, but in the past four years, the Red Cross Society of China has also actively promoted primary health training in more than 60 cities, educating and organizing the people to protect their own health. At present, first aid training has been promoted among workers in some factories, mines, construction, and water and land transportation industries, as well as among students, farmers, and residents. The activities of the first aiders have proven that when the masses master scientific health knowledge, they will exert great power. According to incomplete statistics from the Nanchang City Branch in 1953, the more than 2,000 Red Cross first aiders in the city provided a production value equivalent to approximately 1.5 billion yuan in terms of saved work hours and reduced losses during one year of work. All Red Cross first aiders also play a key role in the patriotic health campaign, engaging in health and safety inspections and supervision while also conducting extensive health education to the masses.

    Although family nursing training for workers' families is still in the trial stage, in the Jingsi Mine Electrical and Mechanical Plant in Beijing alone, it has already done a lot of work in publicizing health knowledge and preventing coal gas poisoning and the spread of measles, providing workers with a clean and healthy living environment so that they can concentrate more on production.

    The Red Cross Society also organized medical and preventive service teams to work in rural areas and minority areas, basically controlling local diseases that had long threatened ethnic minorities and reducing infant mortality rates. For example, the Li people of Hainan Island had very low levels of health and culture due to the long-term oppression of the reactionary rulers, and the infant mortality rate was very high. After the Red Cross medical and preventive service team trained a large number of new midwifery workers there in 1952, this situation has been basically reversed.

    In order to continuously meet the people's needs for improving their health and cultural level, the local branches of the Red Cross Society of China have also conducted health propaganda in various forms that the masses love, in conjunction with the central tasks of the local health departments. The Red Cross branches in Beijing, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Hangzhou, and other places have held regular health lectures. In addition, the medical institutions of the Red Cross Society of China in various places have also treated diseases and carried out vaccinations for the masses.

    The Red Cross Society of China conducts various international activities in accordance with the Chinese people's will to love peace and uphold humanitarian principles. It has organized eight international medical and preventive service teams to serve the Korean people who have suffered from the disasters of war and has provided medical care to American and British prisoners of war; it has repeatedly put forward proposals to maintain world and Far Eastern peace at various international conferences; and has called for negotiations among countries to stop the wars in Korea and Indochina. It has worked to protect the Korean people from the disasters of war and the atrocities of aggression. It has called for a ban on the use of weapons of mass destruction. After the Korean armistice, the Red Cross Society of China participated in the joint Red Cross team to assist in the repatriation of prisoners of war. In addition, it has donated funds to provide relief to disaster victims in India, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Iraq, and has assisted more than 26,000 Japanese nationals in China to return to Japan. In the future, it will redouble its efforts and work with the Red Cross Societies of various countries engaged in humanitarian causes to promote international peace, unity, cooperation, and freedom from human disasters.

    In the four years since the reorganization of the Red Cross Society of China, it has received tremendous help from the Union of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies of the Soviet Union. The establishment of the Soviet Red Cross Hospital in Beijing has not only brought good news to patients but has also become a center for spreading advanced Soviet medicine. In the future, in order to better develop Red Cross work, we should strengthen the study of the rich experience of the Soviet Red Cross.

    All the work and activities of the Red Cross Society of China in the past four years have been carried out according to the will of the people and through the masses. Its various activities in coordination with national construction have proved that it has truly been reborn. It is no longer the passive force of the past that coped with disasters in a narrow scope, but an active force that can participate in the struggle to build a better life, provide various medical services to the working masses, and promote revolutionary humanitarianism in rescuing the dying and healing the wounded.

    The Red Cross Society of New China is still young and lacks a mature and systematic set of experiences to guide its work. However, with the correct leadership of the Central People's Government and the experience of the Red Cross Societies of the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries as a reference, it is believed that relying on the conscientious and active work of the Red Cross workers in various places and relying on the love and support of the broad masses of the people, it will more widely attract the broad masses of the people to participate in its various activities and give full play to its role as an assistant to the government's health departments.

    This year we are celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the Red Cross Society of China, and we are also celebrating the fourth anniversary of its reorganization and rebirth. To this end, we must love the people's Red Cross cause even more and contribute all our strength to the socialist construction and peace cause of the motherland.

    纪念中国红十字会成立五十周年
    中国红十字会总会会长  李德全
    中国红十字会自一九○四年在上海成立起，到今年已整整五十年。
    半个世纪，说明了中国红十字会饱经沧桑，历史悠久。但是，若从一九五○年九月八日它正式改组成为人民自己的卫生救护团体算起，它又是年轻的。它正在发展壮大，它充满着新生的活力，一步一步地创造着自己的事业。
    中国红十字会最初的名称是万国红十字会上海支会。一九○七年改名为大清红十字会。一九一一年辛亥革命之后改名为中国红十字会，正式组织董事会，并制定会员制度。自成立以来，它吸引了不少善良的、热心社会事业的人士参加了它的各项活动。
    由于这些人士的努力，中国红十字会曾经作过一些有益于人民的事情。自成立起到一九三七年抗日战争开始，它曾运用募捐款物等方式，救济过美国旧金山和日本鹿儿岛、东京、横滨等地遭受地震的灾民；救济过土耳其等国及第一次世界大战期间欧洲各国的难民；还曾协助在日本、俄国、德国和奥国的华侨回国。抗日战争时期，又曾组织过救护队、急救队、救护医院等到各战区救护伤兵。在这些年代中，中国红十字会还曾救济了遭受各种灾害的灾民，设立医疗机构给群众治病，并举办医事教育，培养了一些中级医护人员。
    但是，在过去的年月里，在满清封建帝王——军阀袁世凯、徐世昌——蒋介石匪帮掌握下的中国红十字会，几乎没有一年不是忙于应付各种灾害和瘟疫等等。它所进行的活动，也只能是一些不彻底的赈济、施诊、抢救，一直到施棺、掩埋、筹设义冢。一九三三年长城抗日同盟军起，国民党的反动统治者更开始对它实行操纵和限制，一九四三年，进而在红十字会设立了国民党的特别党部和政治部。在抗日战争初期，一些正直的、善良的红十字工作者，虽曾参加八路军、新四军的救护工作，但在蒋介石匪帮的压制下，很快就被调回或遣散了。由于蒋介石匪帮对红十字会工作日甚一日的限制和阻挠，使真正愿意从事红十字事业的人极难继续进行工作，红十字会在人民群众中的影响日趋减弱，会务活动陷于停滞状态。
    一九四九年，中华人民共和国成立，中国人民作了国家的主人，给红十字工作的重新发展开辟了广阔的道路。随着国家建设事业的发展，各界人民对发展红十字会事业的要求也日感迫切，因此在一九五○年九月八日，经过各有关方面所组成的协商会议的努力，完成了对旧红十字会的改组工作，选出了具有广泛代表性的新的理事会，公布了以“预防为主”和“动员与组织人民实行自救助人”为方针的新会章，并且宣布它成为一个人民自己的卫生救护团体。这个决定性的转折，给中国红十字会带来了新的任务，它开始从人民最长远、最根本的利益出发展开了一系列的工作。
    由一九五○年到一九五四年的四年中，它团结了广大的医务工作者，组织了各种形式的医防服务队，参加了为彻底消灭水旱灾害的各项水利工程。在治淮、荆江分洪和河南的治黄、岳阳的南洞庭湖整修、澄锡运河拓浚以及金盆浴鲤水库等各项水利建设中，红十字医防服务队都发挥了忘我的工作精神，贡献了自己的力量。特别是在伟大的治淮工程中，他们在淮河流域巡回工作了四年。这些医防服务队还积极地参加了湘桂铁路、成渝铁路的建设工程，目前则正参加丰沙铁路、官厅水库水力发电站等建设工程的工作。红十字会并深入到工厂、矿山和大、中城市的建筑工地工作。
    不仅如此，四年来，中国红十字会还积极地在六十余座城市中推行了初级卫生训练工作，教育和组织人民自己来保护自己的健康。目前，已经在一些厂矿、建筑及水陆运输等工种的工人中，以及在学生、农民、居民中推行了急救训练。急救员们的活动证明，当群众掌握了科学卫生知识的时候，将会发挥巨大力量。仅据南昌市分会一九五三年不完全的统计，全市二千余红十字急救员在一年工作中，节省工时损耗所提供的生产价值约合十五亿元。所有的红十字急救员还在爱国卫生运动中起着骨干作用，他们一面从事卫生、安全的检查和监督工作，同时，还广泛地向群众进行卫生宣传。
    以工人家属为对象的家庭护理训练虽然还在试办，但是仅在北京京西矿区机电厂一地，已经在宣传卫生常识、防止煤气中毒和麻疹的流行等方面做了不少工作，给工人们安排了整洁的、健康的生活环境，使他们能更专心地从事生产。
    红十字会还组织了医防服务队到农村和少数民族地区工作，使长期威胁兄弟民族的地方性疾病基本上得到控制，降低了婴儿的死亡率。如海南岛黎族人民过去由于反动统治者的长期压迫，卫生文化水平很低，婴儿死亡率很高，一九五二年红十字医防服务队在当地训练了大批新法接生员以后，已基本上扭转了这种情况。
    为了不断满足人民群众提高卫生文化水平的要求，中国红十字会各地分会还结合着当地卫生部门的中心任务，运用各种群众喜爱的方式进行了卫生宣传。北京、广州、福州、杭州等地红十字分会举办了定期的卫生讲座。此外，中国红十字会各地的医疗机构，还为群众治疗疾病和作预防接种等工作。
    中国红十字会遵照中国人民热爱和平、维护人道原则的意志进行各项国际活动。它曾经组织过八个国际医防服务队为遭受战争灾难的朝鲜人民服务，并给予美英战俘以医药照顾；它在各种国际会议上多次提出维护世界及远东和平的建议；呼吁各国进行协商，停止朝鲜及印度支那战争。并为维护朝鲜人民免受战争灾难及侵略暴行而努力。它呼吁禁止使用大规模毁灭性武器。朝鲜停战后，中国红十字会即参加了联合红十字小组，协助战俘遣返工作。此外，它曾捐款救济了印度、英国、荷兰、比利时和伊拉克等国的灾民，并协助两万六千余名在华日侨返回日本。今后它将加倍努力和各国从事人道事业的红十字会在一起，为促进国际和平团结合作，免除人类灾难而工作。
    中国红十字会改组四年以来，曾获得苏联红十字会与红新月联合会的巨大的帮助，北京苏联红十字医院的建立，不仅为病患者带来了福音，而且成为传播苏联先进医学的中心。今后为了更好地发展红十字会工作，应当加强学习苏联红十字事业的丰富经验。
    四年来中国红十字会的一切工作、活动，都是按照人民的意志，通过群众来进行的。它用自己配合国家建设的各种活动证明了，它是真正地获得了新生。它不再是过去在狭小范围内应付灾难的消极力量，而是能够参加到建设美好生活的斗争之中，为劳动群众进行各种医疗服务，并发扬救死扶伤的革命人道主义的积极力量。
    新中国的红十字会还是年轻的，还缺乏一套成熟的、系统的经验来指导工作。可是，由于有中央人民政府的正确领导，有苏联和各人民民主国家红十字会的经验可作借镜，相信依靠各地红十字工作者的认真积极地努力工作，依靠广大人民群众的爱护和支持，它将会更广泛地吸引广大人民群众参加它的各项活动，充分发挥它作为政府卫生部门的助手的作用。
    今年我们要庆祝中国红十字会成立五十周年，同时也要庆祝它改组新生四周年。为此，我们要更加热爱人民红十字事业，为祖国社会主义建设与和平事业，贡献我们的一切力量。
