	Shaanxi Province's Over-Production Campaign Flourishing Everywhere
	Southern Shanxi Province's Cotton Growing Well, Over-Production Expected
	The campaign to over-fulfill the agricultural production increase plan has been vigorously launched in various parts of Shaanxi. In mid-August, the leading Party and government organs of Shaanxi Province issued instructions requiring the province to strive to increase the output of grain and oil crops by another 4% over the original plan and to ensure cotton production, reaching 43.34 jin of ginned cotton per mu. In the second half of August, various localities held meetings one after another to study and implement the province's instructions. The Weinan Special District decided to increase grain production by more than 32.3 million jin and oil crop production by 1.53 million jin over the original plan; the Hanzhong Special District proposed increasing rice production by 10 jin per mu; although the Suide Special District has many hillside fields and poor production conditions, it also wants to increase the production of various crops by 2 jin per mu; Chang'an County plans to increase grain production by 4.8 million jin and ginned cotton by 220,000 jin.
	In order to ensure the realization of this plan, many leading cadres have personally gone deep into districts, townships, and key agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams to guide the work. Now, under the leadership of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, the broad masses of farmers are actively strengthening field management and preventing various natural disasters. The Xujingzhang Agricultural Cooperative in Xingping County has weeded all the cotton fields one more time, carried out timely pruning, and studied methods to improve the harvesting of new cotton. The masses in the sixth district of Chang'an County eliminated cotton bollworms on more than 16,000 mu in three days. Counties such as Foping, Lueyang, and Ningqiang have launched hunting campaigns to protect the autumn harvest, preventing birds and animals from damaging crops. At the same time, all counties plan to harvest carefully and meticulously during the harvest season, increasing the amount of crop harvested by reducing losses.

	The southern part of Shanxi Province has a total of 3.06 million mu of cotton fields, accounting for more than 72% of the province's cotton fields. Although spring sowing was carried out under drought conditions, the cotton farmers have worked hard to process and apply fertilizer and prevent pests and diseases, resulting in very lush growth. At present, the cotton seedlings in irrigated land in the Yuncheng Special District are generally more than two chi tall, with 11 or 12 fruit branches per plant and more than 10 mature cotton bolls. The cotton plants in dry land are one chi six or seven cun tall, with seven or eight fruit branches per plant and five or six mature cotton bolls. In the Quwo County of the Linfen Special District, the cotton seedlings in irrigated land generally have 11 or 12 fruit branches and eight or nine mature cotton bolls, while the cotton seedlings in dry land have five to eight fruit branches and five or six mature cotton bolls per plant. According to the current situation, it is estimated that the above-mentioned areas will not only be able to complete the 1954 cotton production plan, but also achieve the plan of exceeding the production of 10 jin of seed cotton per mu. In various places, mature cotton bolls have begun to open, and in some areas of Linfen, Zhaocheng, and Hongtong, the harvesting of new cotton has begun. (Our reporter station in Shanxi)

    陕西省超额增产运动已在各地蓬勃展开
    山西省南部棉花生长良好超额增产有望
    超额完成农业增产计划运动，已在陕西各地蓬勃展开。八月中旬，陕西省党、政领导机关发出指示，要求全省粮食、油料作物的产量争取较原计划再提高百分之四，并确实保证棉花生产，达到每亩产皮棉四十三点三四斤。各地在八月下半月都先后召开会议，研究、贯彻了省里的指示。渭南专区决定较原计划增产粮食三千二百三十多万斤、油料作物一百五十三万斤；汉中专区提出每亩水稻增产十斤；绥德专区虽然山坡地多，生产条件较差，各种作物每亩也要增产二斤；长安县计划增产粮食四百八十万斤、皮棉二十二万斤。
    为了保证这一计划的实现，许多领导干部亲自深入区、乡和重点农业生产合作社、互助组指导工作。现在广大农民在互助合作组织的带动下，积极加强田间管理工作、防治各种自然灾害。兴平县许敬章农业社已把全部棉花多锄了一次草，并及时进行了整枝，研究了改进采摘新棉的方法；长安县六区群众在三天内治钻心虫一万六千多亩；佛坪、略阳、宁强等县都掀起了打猎保秋运动，防止鸟兽糟蹋作物。同时，各县都计划在收割时，要细收细打，从减少损失上来提高作物的收获量。

    山西南部地区共有三百零六万亩棉田，占全省棉田百分之七十二以上，今春虽是抗旱播种，但由于棉农努力加工加肥、防止病虫害，生长非常茂盛。目前运城专区水地棉苗，一般有二尺多高，每株果枝十一、二个，已成熟棉桃十个以上。旱地棉株高一尺六、七，每株果枝七、八个，成熟棉桃五、六个。临汾专区曲沃县水地棉苗，一般有果枝十一、二个，成熟棉桃八、九个，旱地棉苗每株果枝五至八个，成熟棉桃五、六个。根据目前情况估计，上述地区不仅能完成一九五四年棉花生产计划，并可实现每亩超额增产十斤籽棉的计划。各地成熟棉桃已开始吐絮，临汾、赵城、洪洞部分地区已开始摘新棉。（本报山西记者站）
