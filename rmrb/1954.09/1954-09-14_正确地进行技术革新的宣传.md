    Correctly Conduct Propaganda for Technological Innovation
    Shi Xin

    To struggle for the completion and over-fulfillment of the national plan, to increase labor productivity, and to accelerate the process of national socialist industrialization are the major tasks of our newspapers in the period of economic construction. As an important part of the labor emulation drive, the technological innovation movement plays a huge role in stimulating the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers, increasing labor productivity, completing and over-fulfilling the national plan, and accelerating the development of our country's industry. Therefore, newspapers should attach importance to the propaganda of technological innovation. Its responsibility in this regard is to attract the broad masses of workers to actively participate in the ranks of technological innovation through its own propaganda and reports, and to promote the movement to advance along the correct path.

    Since the achievements of Anshan Iron and Steel's technological innovation and the deeds of production innovators such as Zhang Mingshan and Wang Chonglun began to spread in the second half of last year, especially since the Anshan Iron and Steel Technological Innovation Exhibition was held in Beijing in April this year, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued the "Decision on Launching a Technological Innovation Movement on a National Scale" in May, newspapers in various places have gradually launched propaganda for technological innovation and have achieved initial successes. This is manifested in a relatively prominent introduction of the experience of Anshan Iron and Steel's technological innovation, a relatively wide-ranging report on technological innovation deeds from other places and local areas, the initial establishment of models of technological innovation in their own regions, and a certain struggle against some ideological obstacles in the technological innovation movement. The efforts made by newspapers are undoubtedly worthy of affirmation. But on the other hand, our newspapers' propaganda on technological innovation also has some shortcomings. This is mainly manifested in the tendency of some newspapers to be divorced from current production, labor emulation, and the broad masses of workers in this propaganda. Our newspapers must promptly improve the propaganda of technological innovation in order to more powerfully promote the widespread, in-depth, and healthy development of the movement.

    The purpose of carrying out the technological innovation movement is to push the mass labor emulation drive a step forward and strive to comprehensively complete and over-fulfill the national plan. The newspapers' propaganda of technological innovation must have this clear purpose, so as to guide people to advance along the correct path. Therefore, newspapers should regard technological innovation as an important part of the labor emulation drive in their propaganda and closely integrate it with the requirements of enterprise management. That is to say, in the entire propaganda of technological innovation, the newspapers must be permeated with the spirit that the technological innovation movement must be carried out in an organized and led manner on the basis of labor emulation, focusing on the key problems and weak links in enterprise production. In this regard, some newspapers have provided better examples. For example, the Chongqing Xinhua Daily has focused on publicizing the experience of the 101 Factory's Iron Smelting Plant, which started with the promotion of the Soviet advanced experience "furnace top regulation method," which is decisive for production, carried out technological innovation, widely mobilized the masses to launch a mass labor emulation drive, thereby improving labor productivity, over-fulfilling the national plan, improving production management level, and improving the technical level of workers, as well as the good experiences of other units. The Hebei Daily has also repeatedly elaborated through commentaries and news reports that technological innovation must be closely integrated with improving enterprise management and solving key production problems, and has timely criticized the phenomenon of so-called "thousands of technological innovations, but production tasks are not completed" in some factories and mines that carry out technological innovation in isolation. In this way, the newspaper can guide the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers to carry out technological innovation to solving the main problems in current production. However, some newspapers have, to varying degrees, a tendency to be divorced from labor emulation, divorced from the key problems in current production, and to report on technological innovation in isolation. When reporting on the deeds of technological innovation, these newspapers often focus on how much output a certain innovation can increase or how much value it can create, rather than mainly focusing on its actual effect on the enterprise's comprehensive completion of the national plan. Some newspapers even blindly support the erroneous practice of carrying out technological innovation for the sake of technological innovation in actual work. For example, in order to support and cultivate a "Wang Chonglun-style production innovator," the Yunnan Iron Factory once deviated from the current urgent production tasks and the requirements of improving enterprise management, and allowed him to independently perform simple batch backup tasks that were not affected by upstream and downstream processes, in order to achieve the plan of "completing one year's workload in one quarter." The Yunnan Daily not only failed to timely put forward serious criticisms of the shortcomings and biases of the Yunnan Iron Factory in cultivating production innovators, so as to improve the understanding of the technological innovation movement among the broad masses of workers, especially the leading cadres of enterprises, but instead made blind propaganda at one time. It should be pointed out that a newspaper is a tool of leadership; it can neither become the tail of spontaneous tendencies in actual work, nor can it allow the slightest deviation from the Party's policies.

    In order to promote the widespread, in-depth, and healthy development of the technological innovation movement, the newspaper must also comprehensively reflect the spirit of technological innovation. The content of technological innovation is multi-faceted, including not only the improvement of production equipment and production tools, but also the improvement and enhancement of technical processes, technical standards, operating methods, and labor conditions, etc. Only by fully reflecting the rich content of technological innovation can the newspaper attract more workers to enthusiastically participate in the ranks of technological innovation. Some newspapers have regarded mechanization and automation as the only content of technological innovation, and have required all factories and mines to carry out a mechanization and automation movement. This propaganda is one-sided and not entirely realistic. Because although mechanization and automation are the direction of our enterprises' efforts, and should also be a realistic goal for some enterprises, we cannot hope that all enterprises will mechanize and automate the production process on the basis of our original backward technical foundation. For those enterprises that cannot be mechanized and automated at present, workers should be encouraged to carry out labor emulation according to the specific conditions of the enterprise, put forward rationalization proposals, improve technology, and fully utilize the potential of the equipment. On the other hand, in some newly built and expanded factories and mines, modern equipment has been adopted and there is a high technical foundation. The current problem is how to mobilize workers to better master new equipment and new operating methods. Considering the technological innovation movement merely as mechanization and automation, and encouraging all enterprises to engage in mechanization and automation regardless of the needs and possibilities of production, easily divorces the movement from the actual situation of the enterprises, and easily leaves many people standing outside the movement. Technological innovation certainly originates from the active creation of the broad masses of workers, but on the other hand, it also originates from the study and promotion of existing advanced experience, especially Soviet advanced experience. Soviet advanced experience represents the outstanding achievements of socialist advanced science and technology; our existing advanced experience is the crystallization of the long-term production practice of the Chinese working class and the accumulation of mass wisdom. Facts have proved that conscientiously implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts, learning and promoting Soviet advanced experience and the decisive advanced experience of the masses can effectively improve our production technology and production management and greatly increase labor productivity. One of the common shortcomings of many newspapers in the propaganda of technological innovation at present is that they only focus on reporting the inventions and creations of the broad masses of workers, but do not simultaneously emphasize the learning and promotion of advanced experience; newspapers rarely reflect how the important production innovation achievements that have already been reported are promoted on a larger scale. This kind of propaganda is also one-sided. Some one-sidedness in propaganda, on the one hand, certainly reflects the shortcomings in actual work, and on the other hand, also reflects the lack of complete understanding of technological innovation by the newspaper editorial department. If newspapers want to better guide actual work, they must overcome various one-sidedness and promote the development of the technological innovation movement from various aspects. Recently, some newspapers, such as the Shenyang Daily and the Heilongjiang Daily, have paid attention to publicizing that enterprises must carry out the technological innovation movement realistically according to production needs and possibilities, and have publicized the importance of learning and promoting Soviet advanced experience in the technological innovation movement, which is very necessary.

    The advanced driving the backward, and the backward catching up with the advanced, is the law of socialist enterprises moving forward, and it is the essence of mass labor emulation. Vigorously publicizing production innovators, and using the advanced ideas and advanced deeds of production innovators to influence and drive millions of masses to advance together, is an extremely important aspect of the newspaper's technological innovation propaganda. The so-called advanced ideas mainly refer to socialist consciousness, collectivist thinking, love of science, spirit of overcoming difficulties, and so on. Although our newspapers have reported many technological innovation deeds, there are still not many examples of deeply publicizing the advanced ideas of production innovators. What is particularly weak in this regard is the propaganda of collectivist thinking. It should be seen that collectivism is the noble quality of the working class, and it is a solid ideological foundation for the in-depth development of the technological innovation movement. The newspaper is to educate the broad masses of workers to establish a collectivist spirit through the vivid examples of advanced figures. However, in the past, some newspapers often exaggerated the role of individuals in publicizing the achievements of production innovators. For example, in an article entitled "More than Two Hundred Times," the Shanghai Liberation Daily described in detail how Wang Zhiqiang, a staff member of the Shandong Xinhua Pharmaceutical Factory and a Communist Party member, racked his brains, overcame difficulties, and experimented more than two hundred times over a period of two years and eight months in the process of trial-producing "enameled glass jars," and finally succeeded in manufacturing them. As for the leadership and mass support organized in the trial production process, it was written abstractly and weakly, such as "under the encouragement of the superior Party committee" and "with the help of everyone," which was far less vivid and specific than writing about the activities of advanced producers. Some newspapers' reports on the deeds of production innovators not only failed to truly reflect their socialist consciousness, but instead objectively spread the sentiment of personal ambition and competitiveness. For example, when talking about production innovators learning from Wang Chonglun, they often described their ideological situation in this way: "Wang Chonglun created a universal tool tire, can't we also improve tools?" "Others are technicians and can do it; I am also a technician, why can't I do it!" It must be pointed out that any tendency in propaganda to exaggerate the role of individuals and spread individualism is incompatible with the nature and tasks of the Party's newspaper. The newspaper should not only not publicize these, but should also pay attention to conducting in-depth ideological education for advanced producers and the general masses of workers, helping them to prevent pride and overcome individualism. Recently, the Hebei Daily, Qingdao Daily, Southwest Workers' Daily, Shanxi Daily, and other newspapers have successively launched ideological discussions to educate the broad masses of workers to recognize the relationship between individuals and collectives, the difference between competition and rivalry, and to establish a correct attitude towards participating in labor emulation and technological innovation. The Jiangsu Xinhua Daily reported the fact that Wu Chuanjing, a worker at the Nanjing Light Bulb Factory, relaxed his own production work in order to engage in "inventions" and "creations" out of personal fame and gain, resulting in a major production accident, and through this fact, raised the issue that the broad masses of workers must overcome individualist thinking in the technological innovation movement. Newspapers attach importance to conducting ideological education for the broad masses of workers in the propaganda of technological innovation, and seriously and appropriately criticize various incorrect ideas, which can improve the class consciousness of the broad masses of workers and the conscientiousness of participating in technological innovation.

    At present, the technological innovation movement is gradually unfolding on a national scale. However, the road to technological innovation is not all smooth sailing. On the one hand, many leading cadres of enterprises and the broad masses of workers lack a deep understanding of the significance of technological innovation. They either oppose technological innovation to the central work of factories and mines, or emphasize that their own production conditions are special, or are satisfied with the existing production level, and therefore do not actively carry out and participate in technological innovation movements. On the other hand, this movement in some factories and mines is very spontaneous and blind, and is not carried out in an organized and led manner, so the movement cannot become a powerful guarantee for completing the national plan. In order to promote the widespread, in-depth, and correct development of the technological innovation movement, our newspapers need to better grasp the movement's guiding principles and policies, and go deeper into reality, so as to improve the propaganda of technological innovation a step further.

    正确地进行技术革新的宣传
    湜辛
    为完成和超额完成国家计划，为提高劳动生产率，为加速国家社会主义工业化的进程而斗争，是我们报纸在经济建设时期的重大任务。作为劳动竞赛重要内容的技术革新运动，对于发挥职工群众的积极性和创造性，提高劳动生产率，完成和超额完成国家计划，加速我国工业的发展，有着巨大的作用。因此，报纸应当重视技术革新的宣传。它在这方面的责任，就是要通过自己的宣传报道吸引广大职工积极地参加到技术革新的行列中来，并推动运动循着正确的道路前进。
    自从去年下半年鞍钢技术革新的成就和张明山、王崇伦等生产革新者的事迹开始传播以来，特别是今年四月鞍钢技术革新展览会在北京举行、五月中华全国总工会发布“关于在全国范围内开展技术革新运动的决定”以来，各地报纸都逐步展开了技术革新的宣传，并取得了初步的成就。这就是比较突出地介绍了鞍钢技术革新的经验，比较广泛地报道了外地和本地的技术革新事迹，开始树立了本地区的技术革新的榜样，向技术革新运动中的某些思想障碍进行了一定的斗争。报纸所做的这些努力，无疑是应当加以肯定的。但是在另一方面，我们的报纸关于技术革新的宣传，也存在着一些缺点。这主要表现在：有些报纸在这一宣传中有脱离当前生产，脱离劳动竞赛，脱离广大职工群众的倾向。我们的报纸必须对技术革新的宣传及时加以改进，才能更有力地推动运动广泛深入地、健康地开展。
    开展技术革新运动的目的，在于把群众性的劳动竞赛向前推进一步，争取全面完成和超额完成国家计划。报纸进行技术革新的宣传，必须具有这种鲜明的目的性，这样才能引导人们沿着正确的道路前进。因此，报纸在宣传中就应当将技术革新当作劳动竞赛的一项重要内容，并和企业管理的要求紧密地结合起来。这就是说，报纸在技术革新的全部宣传中，必须贯穿着一个精神，即技术革新运动必须在劳动竞赛的基础上，围绕着企业生产上的关键问题和薄弱环节，有组织有领导地开展。在这方面，有些报纸已经提供了较好的例子。例如，重庆新华日报就曾着重地宣传了一零一厂炼铁场从推广对生产有决定意义的苏联先进经验“炉顶调剂法”入手，开展技术革新，广泛地发动群众性的劳动竞赛，从而提高了劳动生产率，超额完成了国家计划，提高了生产管理水平，并提高了职工技术水平的经验，以及其他单位的好的经验。河北日报也曾通过评论和新闻报道反复阐明技术革新必须和改进企业管理、解决生产关键问题紧密结合，并对某些厂矿孤立地开展技术革新的所谓“技术革新千千万，生产任务完不成”的现象，适时地提出了批评。这样，报纸就能把广大职工进行技术革新的积极性引导到解决当前生产上的主要课题方面来。但是有些报纸却在不同的程度上存在着脱离劳动竞赛、脱离当前生产中的关键问题而孤立地报道技术革新的倾向。这些报纸在报道技术革新的事迹时，常常局限于某一项革新能够提高多少产量或创造多少价值，而不是主要地着眼于它对于企业全面地完成国家计划的实际效果。有的报纸甚至对实际工作中为技术革新而技术革新的错误做法盲目加以支持。例如，云南铁工厂为了支持和培养一个“王崇伦式的生产革新者”，曾经脱离了当前迫切的生产任务和改进企业管理的要求，让他去单独执行不受上下道工序影响的简单成批的后备任务，以便实现“一季完成一年工作量”的计划。云南日报对云南铁工厂在培养生产革新者工作中的缺点和偏向不但没有及时提出严肃的批评，以提高职工群众特别是企业领导干部对技术革新运动的认识，反而一度作了盲目的宣传。应当指出，报纸是一种领导的工具；它既不能成为实际工作中自流倾向的尾巴，也不能容许离开党的政策的最微小的偏差。
    为了推动技术革新运动广泛深入地、健康地开展，报纸还必须全面地体现技术革新的精神。技术革新的内容是多方面的，既包括生产设备和生产工具的改进，也包括技术过程、技术标准、操作方法和劳动条件等等的改善和提高。报纸只有充分地反映出技术革新的丰富内容，才能吸引更多的职工踊跃地参加到技术革新的行列中来。有的报纸曾经把机械化自动化当作技术革新的唯一内容，要求所有的厂矿都开展一个机械化自动化的运动。这种宣传是片面的，不完全切合实际的。因为机械化自动化虽然是我们企业的努力方向，对于有些企业来说也应是现实的奋斗目标，但在我国原来落后的技术基础之上，目前我们还不能希望所有的企业都把生产过程机械化自动化。对于那些目前还不可能机械化自动化的企业，应当鼓励职工群众根据企业的具体情况开展劳动竞赛，提出合理化建议，改进技术充分发挥设备潜力。另一方面，在有些新建和扩建的厂矿中，已经采用了近代化的设备，有着高度的技术基础，当前的问题是如何动员职工更好地掌握新的设备和新的操作方法。将技术革新运动仅仅看作机械化自动化，鼓励一切企业不问生产的需要和可能，都来搞机械化自动化，这就容易使运动脱离企业的实际状况，并且容易使许多人站在运动的外面。技术上的革新固然来源于职工群众的积极创造，但是另一方面，也来源于现有先进经验特别是苏联先进经验的学习与推广。苏联先进经验代表着社会主义先进科学技术的卓越成就；我们现有的先进经验，是我国工人阶级长期生产实践的结晶，是群众智慧的积累。事实证明，认真贯彻苏联专家的建议，学习和推广苏联的先进经验以及群众中有决定意义的先进经验，就可以有效地改进我们的生产技术和生产管理，大大提高劳动生产率。目前不少报纸在技术革新宣传中带有普遍性的缺点之一，就是只着重报道职工群众的发明创造，而没有同时强调学习和推广先进经验；报纸对于已经报道的重要的生产革新成就，也很少反映它们如何在更大的范围内得到推广。这种宣传同样是片面的。宣传上的某些片面性，一方面固然反映了实际工作中的缺点，另一方面也反映了报纸编辑部对于技术革新的认识不够完整。报纸要更好地指导实际工作，就必须克服各种片面性，从多方面去推动技术革新运动的开展。最近有些报纸，如沈阳日报、黑龙江日报等，注意宣传了企业必须根据生产需要和可能实事求是地开展技术革新运动，宣传了在技术革新运动中学习和推广苏联先进经验的重要，这是十分必要的。
    先进的带动落后的，落后的赶上先进的，乃是社会主义企业向前发展的规律，是群众性的劳动竞赛的实质。大力宣扬生产革新者，用生产革新者的先进思想和先进事迹，来影响和带动千百万群众一同前进，是报纸技术革新宣传的一个极其重要的方面。所谓先进思想，主要是指社会主义觉悟，集体主义思想，热爱科学的态度，克服困难的精神，等等。我们的报纸虽然报道了不少的技术革新事迹，但是深刻地宣传了生产革新者的先进思想的例子还是不多的。在这方面宣传得特别薄弱的是集体主义思想。应当看到，集体主义是工人阶级的高贵品质，是技术革新运动得以深入开展的坚实的思想基础。报纸就是要通过先进人物的活生生的榜样，来教育广大职工树立起集体主义精神。可是过去有些报纸宣传生产革新者的成就，常常夸大个人的作用。例如，上海解放日报在一篇题为“两百多次”的文章中，详细描述了山东新华药厂工作人员、共产党员王志强在试制“搪玻璃罐”过程中如何绞尽脑汁，克服困难，试验了两百多次，历时两年零八个月，终于制造成功。至于在试制过程中组织的领导和群众的支持却被写得抽象无力，如“在上级党委的鼓励下”、“在大家的帮助下”，远不如写先进生产者个人的活动那样生动具体。有些报纸报道生产革新者的事迹，不仅没有真正反映出他们的社会主义觉悟，反而在客观上传播了个人逞强好胜的情绪。如在谈到生产革新者学习王崇伦时，常常这样描写他们的思想情况：“王崇伦创造了个万能工具胎，难道咱就不能也来改进工具吗？”“别人是技工，能行；我也是技工，为啥不行！”必须指出，宣传上的任何夸大个人作用、传播个人主义的偏向，都是和党的报纸的性质和任务不相容的。报纸不仅不应当宣传这些，而且应当注意对先进生产者和一般职工群众进行深入的思想教育，帮助他们防止骄傲情绪，克服个人主义。近来河北日报、青岛日报、西南工人日报、山西日报等先后开展了思想讨论，教育广大职工认识个人和集体的关系，竞赛和竞争的区别，树立参加劳动竞赛和技术革新的正确态度。江苏新华日报报道了南京灯泡厂工人吴传经从个人名利出发，放松本身生产工作来搞“发明”“创造”，以致造成重大生产事故的事实，并通过这个事实提出了职工群众在技术革新运动中必须克服个人主义思想的问题。报纸在技术革新的宣传中重视对职工群众进行思想教育，严肃地适当地批判各种不正确的思想，就能提高职工群众的阶级觉悟和参加技术革新的自觉性。
    目前技术革新运动正在全国范围内逐步展开。但是在技术革新的道路上并不是一帆风顺的。一方面，不少企业领导干部和职工群众对技术革新的意义还缺乏深刻的认识，他们或者将技术革新和厂矿的中心工作对立起来，或者强调自己的生产条件特殊，或者满足于现有的生产水平，因而不去积极地开展和参加技术革新运动。另一方面，这一运动在某些厂矿又带有很大的自发性和盲目性，没有有组织有领导地进行，因而运动还不能成为完成国家计划的有力保证。为了推动技术革新运动广泛深入地并且是正确地开展起来，就需要我们的报纸更好地掌握运动的方针政策，更加深入实际，以便把技术革新的宣传提高一步。
