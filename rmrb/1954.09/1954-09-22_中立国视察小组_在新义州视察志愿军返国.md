    在新义州视察志愿军返国
    【新华社新义州二十日电】驻新义州的中立国视察小组在十九日继续视察撤出朝鲜的中国人民志愿军军事人员和他们携带的武器弹药。
    十九日撤出朝鲜的中国人民志愿军军事人员共二千五百四十二名。从十六日到十九日，撤出朝鲜的中国人民志愿军军事人员总计已达一万七千五百一十八名。十九日执行视察任务的是瑞士组员和捷克斯洛伐克组员组成的分组。虽然十九日是星期日，但分组人员仍照常执行视察任务。和过去三天一样，分组人员清点了出境的各次列车上的军事人员，并分别抽查了军事人员携带的武器弹药。分组人员对十九日的视察没有提出任何意见或问题，也没有因为数字不符进行过复查。
    【新华社新义州二十一日电】中国人民志愿军返国部队二十日开始从朝鲜撤出各种大炮和装甲车辆。驻新义州口岸的中立国视察小组二十日视察了载运作战物资和军事人员的各次列车。中立国监察委员会波兰候补委员尤莱维奇上校和瑞士委员格罗斯将军也先后从开城抵达新义州，参加二十日的视察工作。
    二十日，当载运坦克和炮弹以及高射炮、无后坐力炮、牵引车辆和装箱的高射机枪等作战物资的四列火车陆续到达新义州车站时，由当天执行视察任务的瑞典组员和波兰组员组成的分组视察了每一车厢内的作战物资，并曾进入坦克炮塔内进行视察，还抽查了无后坐力炮和牵引车辆。
    中立国视察小组在视察过程中，仍像前四天一样，没有向朝中联络官提出疑问，也没有进行复查。视察在下午五时三十分结束。
