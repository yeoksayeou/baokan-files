    The Profound Changes in Higher Education in New China
    Qian Weichang, Representative of the National People's Congress and Provost of Tsinghua University

    In the past five years, China's higher education has seen significant improvements in both quantity and quality. In 1953, the number of students in national universities and colleges reached 216,765. This summer, over 90,000 more young people were admitted, a number that was incomparable to the old universities and colleges before liberation. Taking Tsinghua University as an example, the number of new students this year is roughly equal to the total number of students in the entire university before liberation.

    In the past five years, due to the implementation of the policy of serving workers and peasants in schools at all levels, the proportion of worker-peasant students has increased year by year. Among the new students enrolled in national universities and colleges in the autumn of 1953, worker-peasant students accounted for more than 40 percent. The state has given great care and attention to the issue of worker-peasant students entering universities and colleges. Many universities and colleges have set up worker-peasant rapid middle schools, creating favorable conditions for worker-peasant youth to enter universities and colleges. For example, the worker-peasant rapid middle school attached to Tsinghua University had thirty graduates this summer, all of whom were admitted to universities. One of them even ranked first in North China for admission to Tsinghua University. After worker-peasant youth enter universities and colleges, each school establishes special classes or assigns special teachers to guide their studies, based on the characteristics and circumstances of worker-peasant youth. Because worker-peasant youth have higher political awareness and stronger perseverance, their progress in learning is also more significant. The twenty-eight worker-peasant students in the mechanical manufacturing major at Tsinghua University achieved excellent and good results in 80 percent of their studies over the past year. Before liberation, children of the working people rarely had the opportunity to enter the gates of universities and colleges; but now, under the people's democratic system, higher education implements the policy of serving workers and peasants, and much work has already been done in this regard.

    Since liberation, Chinese women have shattered the feudal shackles of thousands of years, and their political and economic status has been universally improved. This situation is also reflected in the scope of higher education. In the past five years, the number of female students in universities and colleges has continued to grow. Among the new students enrolled this year, female students in schools in North China alone exceeded one-third. Female students not only participate in the study of literature, law, normal, finance and economics, science, medicine, and agriculture, but also participate in the study of various industrial technologies in large numbers. Before liberation, female students in university engineering departments could be said to be few and far between, and even if they graduated, they rarely obtained positions as technicians or engineers due to discrimination in the old society. Now it is different. According to statistics on new students in ten industrial universities in North China, the number of female students has exceeded one-third. In Tsinghua University, female students account for 40 percent of the new students studying civil engineering and architecture. Female students are generally active and hardworking in their studies and achieve excellent results. Last year, one-third of the 140-odd classes in Tsinghua University had female class leaders, who led and united all the students in their studies.

    Due to the continuous expansion of universities and colleges, the number of graduates has also increased year by year. This year alone, more than 40,000 graduates from universities and colleges have taken up various work posts in the socialist construction of the motherland under the unified allocation of the state. Looking back at the pre-liberation era, the national universities and colleges could not graduate even 10,000 or 20,000 people a year, and the employment problem of graduates seemed to be an unsolvable problem forever. But after liberation, due to the rapid development of the motherland's construction undertakings, although the number of graduates each year is larger than in the past, it still cannot meet the needs of the country's construction undertakings. This shows that in New China, the path of life and work for a young person is infinitely broad.

    China's higher education has not only expanded in number, but also enriched in content. Since 1952, after the adjustment of departments and faculties, and according to the needs of national construction and with reference to Soviet experience, more than 170 specialties have been established. Each specialty has a clear training goal. Many of these specialties were not considered independent disciplines before liberation, or some were even unheard of. However, due to the rapid progress of national industrial construction, it is necessary to train cadres for these specialties within a certain period of time. For example, the specialty of foundry and foundry machinery, in capitalist countries, except for the University of Toronto in Canada, which has a similar specialty, there are no independently established ones, but China now has four foundry specialties. Another example is the specialty of electrification of water energy utilization enterprises, which cannot be found at all in capitalist countries. After more than two years of effort, some of these specialties have reached a certain scale, and some have had the first batch of graduates enter factories and mines to work.

    In order to ensure the quality of these specialized cadres, universities and colleges, under the unified leadership of the Central Higher Education Department, have revised the teaching plans and necessary teaching outlines, and are implementing a planned and purposeful teaching policy. University and college teachers are working day and night to improve themselves and have opened hundreds of new courses to meet the requirements of the teaching plan. For the first time in Chinese universities and colleges, brand-new courses and textbooks such as civil construction, industrial design, process automation, relay protection, water energy utilization, foundry machinery, mechanical manufacturing engineering, house erection, and electric drive have appeared. Thanks to the selfless help of Soviet experts, many new types of advanced scientific bases have gradually been formed in universities and colleges across the country.

    Before liberation, universities and colleges reflected the characteristics of semi-colonial teaching. Only a few courses were taught in our own language, and some people even absurdly believed that it was impossible to teach science and technology in the language of the Chinese people. After liberation, this shameful phenomenon has been completely eliminated in universities and colleges. Through the efforts of thousands of teachers, we have compiled and translated thousands of textbooks and reference books. From entering school to graduation, students have been using Chinese textbooks. In order to compile and translate these textbooks, scientific workers across the country have also reviewed and approved hundreds of thousands of scientific and technical terms. This work not only relieved students of the difficulties of language barriers in learning and improved learning outcomes, but also prepared very important conditions for the development and popularization of science in China.

    After five years of reform, the political ideology of teachers and students in universities and colleges has also made significant progress. The viewpoint of serving the people has been established, and the leadership position of the working class ideology has been established and consolidated. In universities and colleges, not only have common compulsory courses such as "History of the Chinese Revolution," "Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism," and "Political Economy" been universally offered, but some schools have also further established philosophy courses such as "Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism." Moreover, teachers are conducting universal political and ideological education to students through all courses. In higher industrial schools, architectural design requires "concern for people" as the leading ideology, constantly criticizing the architectural thoughts of structuralism, cosmopolitanism, and formalism, and requiring a high degree of unity between form and content. All production courses emphasize concern for the working people, paying attention to mechanization and automation to reduce physical labor and improve working conditions. All design courses comprehensively implement the economic viewpoint of saving funds for the working people and the overall viewpoint that all construction must be coordinated with each other. Through strict requirements on students in the teaching process, the sense of responsibility of students as future new-type engineers is established, so that they can realize that any slight negligence will bring huge losses to the motherland. Through the teaching process, students' independent working ability is consciously cultivated, so that students can realize that as a high-level construction talent, they must have the spirit of creatively overcoming difficulties. Through all teaching activities, students' professional ideology is cultivated, so that students can realize that serving the construction of the motherland through their respective specialties is the most glorious responsibility of high-level construction talents. At the same time, teachers are also striving to carry out education in patriotism and internationalism, so that every student enthusiastically pays attention to the construction achievements of our country and the Soviet Union related to their specialties. Students in the Department of Water Conservancy will tell you everything about the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station as if they were familiar with its treasures, and their great ideals for the Yangtze River Hydroelectric Power Station. The great scientific creations of Zhang Heng and Lomonosov have gradually become known to students, and they are proud to learn the brilliant achievements of these great scientists. New qualities are rapidly growing in students. When students leave factories, construction sites, relevant business departments, and research institutions after production internships and return to school, people in these departments will tell you, "These students work very well, and are not at all like the young masters and misses of the old universities. We hope they can graduate earlier and join our work." They left a good impression in their internship places that a new type of labor intellectual should have.

    The principle of linking theory with practice has been established as the guiding principle for the teaching work of universities and colleges across the country. Not only are our specialized settings and training numbers determined according to the actual needs of the motherland's construction, but also various teaching measures in universities and colleges are implementing the principle of linking with the actual situation of the motherland's construction. In the classroom, we can hear about the structural problems of the Fozi Ridge Reservoir arch dam, the construction layout of the Zhengzhou Power Plant, the erection of high-voltage lines in Northeast China, the factory construction problems of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, Zheng Xikun's separate starting method, and the analysis of high-speed cutting and multi-blade tools in mechanical manufacturing plants across the country. We can see that specific data on industrial construction in various places are used in course design and graduation design, and even the design of actual problems is being carried out. Every summer, tens of thousands of university and college students across the country conduct production internships in various construction sites, factories and mines, business departments, and research institutions, and delve into various practical problems under the leadership of internship instructors. Their graduation theses and graduation designs are summary learning processes that combine theory and practice. They not only draw subjects from practice, but also use the theoretical knowledge they have learned over the past few years to deal with these practical problems. Higher industrial schools have received strong support from various enterprise departments in training new-type engineers, and schools and enterprise departments have signed various types of contact contracts. This contract ensures the realization of the teaching policy of linking theory with practice, and also ensures the continuous improvement of teaching quality.

    Every summer, thousands of university teachers conduct various scientific activities in factories, mines, construction sites, and agencies across the country. Similarly, a large number of engineers and technicians enter universities and colleges every year to participate in amateur study or part-time teaching. These exchanges have made the connections between universities and colleges and enterprise departments and agencies increasingly close. This brings practical scientific research topics to universities and colleges, and promotes and leads our teachers to move forward.

    The continuous improvement of the teaching quality of universities and colleges can be fully reflected in the situation of graduates. This summer, the graduating class of specialized students from Tsinghua University studied entirely according to the teaching plan after the teaching reform. Although they only studied for two years, from their specific performance in graduation internships and from their graduation design defenses, it can be clearly seen that they have definitely surpassed the level of the old four-year graduates in both theoretical knowledge and practical experience.

    Under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, and due to the unremitting efforts of all teachers, many difficulties have been overcome and great achievements have been made. However, at a time when the state is carrying out large-scale economic construction in a planned way, the state's need for senior technical cadres is also increasing day by day. The 141 large-scale projects that the great Soviet Union is helping our country to rebuild and build require a large number of cadres who have mastered advanced technology. Therefore, in the future, universities and colleges must not only train more cadres in quantity, but also give these cadres more modern and higher-quality training in quality; and the types of training specialties will also be more complex and extensive than in the past. We higher education workers fully recognize the arduousness of these tasks, but based on the work experience of the past five years, we have full confidence in completing these glorious tasks.

    新中国高等教育的深刻变化
    全国人民代表大会代表 清华大学教务长  钱伟长
    五年来，我国的高等教育，不论在数量上或质量上，都有了显著的提高。一九五三年全国高等学校的学生已达二十一万六千七百六十五人，今年暑假又招收了九万余青年入学，这个人数是解放以前的旧高等学校无法相比的。仅以清华大学为例，单是今年新生的数量就和解放前全校的学生总数约略相等。
    这五年来，由于各级学校贯彻了为工农服务的方针，工农学生的比例逐年增高。一九五三年秋季入学的全国高等学校新生中，工农学生占有百分之四十以上。国家对于工农学生进入高等学校学习的问题，给予了极大的关怀和重视。许多高等学校附设了工农速成中学，给工农青年进入高等学校创造了良好的条件。像清华大学附设的工农速成中学，今年暑期毕业生三十人，不仅全部考上了大学，中间还有一人是华北区考上清华大学的第一名。工农青年进入高等学校以后，各校根据工农青年的特点和情况，都设立专班或指派专门教师指导他们的学习。由于工农青年政治觉悟较高，毅力较强，因而在学习上的进步也较显著。清华大学机械制造专业的二十八个工农学生，一年来学习的结果，百分之八十达到了优秀和良好的成绩。解放前，劳动人民的子女，很少有走进高等学校大门的机会；而现时，在人民民主制度下，高等教育执行着为工农服务的方针，并且在这方面已经做了许多工作。
    解放以来，新中国妇女粉碎了数千年来的封建枷锁，政治、经济地位普遍提高，这种情况也反映在高等教育的范围内。五年来，高等学校的女生人数不断增长。在本年度入学新生中，仅华北区各校的女生便超过了三分之一。女生不仅参加文、法、师范、财经、理、医、农等科的学习，并且也大量地参加各种工业技术的学习。解放前，在大学工科里的女生可以说是寥寥可数的，就是毕业了也因受到旧社会的歧视，很少能获得技术员或工程师的职位。现在不同了。根据华北区十个工业大学的新生统计，女生人数已超过三分之一。清华大学学习土木建筑的新生中，女生人数达到了百分之四十。女生在学习当中一般都积极努力，成绩优秀。清华大学上年度一百四十几个班中有三分之一的班长是女生，她们领导着、团结着全班同学进行学习。
    由于高等学校的不断扩大，毕业生人数也年有增加。只今年高等学校就有四万多名毕业生在国家统一分配下走上祖国社会主义建设事业的各种工作岗位。回想解放前，全国高等学校一年也毕业不了一两万人，而且毕业生的就业问题好像永远是解决不了的难题。但在解放以后，由于祖国建设事业的迅速发展，每年毕业生虽较以往为多，却仍不能满足国家建设事业的需要。这说明，在新中国，一个青年的生活和工作的道路是无限宽广的。
    我国的高等教育，不仅人数扩大了，而且内容也丰富了。自一九五二年后，经过了院系调整，根据国家建设的需要，并参照苏联经验，设置了一百七十多种专业。每个专业都有明确的培养目标。这里面有很多专业在解放前并不认为是一个独立的学科，甚或有些专业是闻所未闻的。但是由于国家工业建设的飞跃进步，就在一定时期内要求培养这些专业干部。例如铸工及铸工机械这样一个专业，在资本主义国家内除了加拿大都朗多大学有这样一个类似的专业外，就没有独立设置的，但是我国现在有四个铸工专业。又如水能利用企业电气化这样的专业，在资本主义国家内就根本找不到。这些专业经过了两年多来的努力，有的已具有一定规模，有的已有第一批毕业生进入工厂矿场工作了。
    为了保证这些专业干部的质量，高等学校在中央高等教育部统一领导下，修订了教学计划和必要的教学大纲，执行着有计划有目的的教学方针。高等学校教师们夜以继日地努力提高自己，开出了数以百计的新课程，来满足教学计划的要求。在我国高等学校内首次出现了像土木施工、工业设计、工序自动化、继电器保护、水能利用、铸造机械、机械制造工学、房屋架设、电力拖动等崭新的课程和教材。由于苏联专家的无私帮助，在全国各个高等学校内逐渐形成了不少新型的先进科学的基地。
    在解放前，高等学校里反映着半殖民地教学的特点，只有很少的课程用我们自己的语言讲授，有些人甚至荒谬地认为用中国人民的语言不可能讲授科学和技术。解放以后，高等学校里已经完全扫除了这种可耻的现象。经过千百个教师的努力，我们编著和翻译了上千种教材和参考书。学生从进学校到毕业，已经全部使用中文的教材。为了编著和翻译这些教材，全国的科学工作者还审定了几十万个科学技术名词。这些工作不仅解除了学生在学习上语言隔膜的困难，提高了学习效果，并且为我国科学的发展和普及，准备了很重要的条件。
    高等学校经过五年来的改革，师生的政治思想也有了显著的进步，确立了为人民服务的观点，树立和巩固了工人阶级思想的领导地位。在高等学校里，不仅普遍开设了“中国革命史”、
  “马克思列宁主义基础”和“政治经济学”等三门共同必修的课程，有些学校还进一步设立了“辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义”的哲学课程，而且教师们通过一切课程，向学生在进行着普遍的政治思想教育。在高等工业学校里，建筑设计要求以“对人的关怀”作为领导思想，不断地批判着结构主义、世界主义和形式主义的建筑思想，要求形式和内容的高度统一。一切生产课程无不强调对劳动人民的关怀，注意机械化和自动化以减少体力劳动和提高劳动条件。一切设计课程全面贯彻着为劳动人民节省资金的经济观点，和一切建设必须要互相配合的全面观点。通过在教学过程中对学生的严格要求，建立学生作为一个未来的新型工程师的责任感，使他们体会到任何细微的疏忽都会给祖国带来巨大的损失。通过教学过程，并有意识地培养学生的独立工作能力，使学生体会到做为一个高级建设人才，必须具有创造地克服困难的精神。通过一切教学活动，培养着学生们的专业思想，使学生们体会到通过各自的专业来为祖国建设服务，乃是高级建设人才最光荣的职责。同时，教师们也努力进行着爱国主义和国际主义的教育，使每个学生热情地关注着我国和苏联有关专业的各种建设的成就。水利系的学生，会如数家珍地告诉你关于古比雪夫水电站的一切和他们对于扬子江水电站的伟大理想。张衡和罗蒙诺索夫等伟大的科学创造已逐渐为学生们所通晓，并且为学习着这些伟大科学家的光辉成就而感到骄傲。新的品质在学生中迅速地成长着，当生产实习后学生们离开工厂、工地和有关业务部门及研究机关返校的时候，这些部门的人会告诉你，“这些学生工作得很好，和旧大学的那些少爷小姐毫无相像之处。希望他们能早些毕业，参加我们的工作。”他们在实习场所给人们留下了一个新型的劳动知识分子所应有的良好的印象。
    理论联系实际已经确立为全国高等学校教学工作的指导原则，不仅我们的专业设置和培养数量是根据祖国建设的实际需要来决定的，就是高等学校各种教学措施也都贯彻着联系祖国建设的实际的原则。我们在讲堂里可以听到像佛子岭水库连拱坝的结构问题、郑州发电厂的施工布置问题、东北高压线的架设问题、第一汽车制造厂的工厂化施工问题、郑锡坤的分别起动法，以及全国各地机械制造厂的高速切削和多刀多刃等问题的分析。我们看见在课程设计和毕业设计里运用着各地工业建设的具体资料，甚至就在进行着实际问题的设计。每年夏季全国有数以万计的高等学校学生在各工地、各厂矿、各业务部门、各研究机关进行生产实习，在实习指导人员领导下钻研着各种的实际问题。他们的毕业论文、毕业设计是理论和实际结合的总结性的学习过程，不仅从实际中吸取了题材，并且运用着几年来所学的理论知识，来处理这些实际问题。高等工业学校在培养新型的工程师上获得了各个企业部门的大力支持，学校和企业部门之间订立了各种各样的联系合同。这种合同保证了理论联系实际的教学方针的实现，同时也保证了教学质量的不断提高。
    每年暑期内数以千百计的大学教师到全国各厂矿各工地和机关里进行着各种各样的科学活动。同样，每年也有数目众多的工程师、技术人员进入高等学校参加业余的学习或兼课。这些交往使高等学校和企业部门及机关的联系日益密切了。这就给高等学校带来了切合实际的科学研究题材，推动着带领着我们教师向前迈进。
    高等学校教学质量的不断提高，从毕业生的情况里可以完全反映出来。今年暑期清华大学毕业的一班专修科同学，是完全根据教学改革以后的教学计划进行学习的，他们虽然只学习了两年，但是从他们的毕业实习的具体表现里，从他们的毕业设计的答辩里，可以很明显地看到，他们不论在理论知识和实际经验方面都肯定地超过了旧制四年毕业生的水平。
    在党和政府的正确领导下，由于全体教师不懈的努力，已经克服了不少的困难，取得了巨大的成就。但是在国家有计划地大规模地展开经济建设的时候，国家对于高级技术干部的需要也在与日俱增。伟大苏联帮助我国重建和新建的一百四十一项规模巨大的工程就需要大量的掌握先进技术的干部。因此，高等学校在今后不仅在数量上要培养更多的干部，在质量上要给予这些干部更近代化和质量更高的训练；并且在训练的专业类型上也将较过去更为复杂更为广泛。我们高等教育工作者充分认识到这些任务的艰巨性，但在五年来的工作经验基础上，我们完全有信心来完成这些光荣的任务。
