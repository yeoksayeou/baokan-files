The state began implementing planned procurement of edible oils and oilseeds and universally implemented planned supply of edible oil in cities and industrial and mining areas around November last year. Initial implementation results have effectively guaranteed the supply of edible oil to urban and industrial and mining areas and export needs, combated speculation, and stabilized the oil and fat market. By the end of July this year, according to incomplete statistics, there were already 244 large, medium, and small cities across the country that had implemented planned supply. Wherever planned supply has been implemented, the market is stable and the supply is normal. In terms of planned procurement, with the active support of the broad masses of peasants, by the end of July this year, the state's 1953 fiscal year (from the fourth quarter of 1953 to the third quarter of 1954 when new oil was on the market) oil and oilseed procurement plan had been completed by 98.45 percent.

After the liberation of the whole country, the production of edible oils and oilseeds in our country, due to the limitation of cultivated area, coupled with the lack of foresight in the financial and economic departments in previous years, and insufficient attention to appropriately encouraging and helping farmers increase the production of oil crops, the development of oil crop production in recent years has not yet reached the level before the Anti-Japanese War. However, production has developed compared with the beginning of liberation. The national edible oil production in 1953 increased by 29 percent compared with 1950. At present, the characteristic of the supply of edible oil in our country failing to meet demand is mainly because, as the country enters a period of large-scale industrial construction, with the continuous improvement of people's purchasing power, the consumption of edible oil in urban and rural areas has increased year by year, and the rate of increase in this respect is faster than the rate of increase in production. According to statistics from four major cities, Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Wuhan, the average per capita consumption of edible oil has increased in recent years after liberation. Taking Beijing as an example, the average per capita consumption of edible oil was more than seven jin in 1950, more than ten jin in 1951, more than eleven jin in 1952, and more than thirteen jin in 1953. Not only is this the case in cities, but also in rural areas, farmers have changed from not eating oil or eating less oil in the past to greatly increasing their oil consumption.

In order to guarantee the supply of edible oil to the people of the whole country, the state has adopted planned procurement of edible oils and oilseeds and implemented planned supply of edible oil in cities from around November last year, to balance production and sales. Since the implementation of planned supply of edible oil, it has not only appropriately guaranteed the supply of edible oil to the people in large cities and industrial and mining areas, but also appropriately taken care of the increasing need for edible oil in the vast rural areas. In this production year from the time oilseeds were put on the market in the third quarter of 1953 to the time oilseeds were put on the market in 1954, the oilseeds planned to be purchased by the state only accounted for 65 percent of the oilseed production, and 35 percent of the oilseeds remained in the rural areas for farmers to use themselves and adjust with each other. In addition, the state took out 35 percent of the oilseeds procured in the plan and transferred them to the rural areas to supply farmers who do not grow or grow few oil crops.

After the state implemented planned supply of edible oil in cities, private oil mills, oil workshops, and oil merchants were appropriately and cautiously handled and settled. Due to the adoption of these necessary measures, the monthly sales of edible oil in major and medium-sized cities have significantly decreased compared with before. The sales volume in July this year in five major cities, Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangzhou, decreased by an average of 15.76 percent compared with before the planned supply; in medium-sized cities such as Hengyang City, Hunan Province, after the planned supply began in April, the sales volume decreased by 29 percent compared with March, and decreased by 13 percent in May compared with April.

Before the implementation of planned supply, the edible oil market in Shanghai was disrupted by illegal private merchants using speculative activities such as refusing to sell, raising prices, cornering the market, and hoarding, creating rumors and confusing the public, causing consumer panic about edible oil. The highest sales volume of edible oil in Shanghai even exceeded the actual demand by three or four times, and the monthly sales plan of the China Grease Company was often broken through. After the implementation of planned supply, the speculative activities of illegal private merchants were dealt a deserved blow, and the market sales of edible oil returned to normal. In the vast rural areas, because the state implemented planned supply, the rural edible oil market was stable. Most farmers can actively support this measure. In a few areas, because there are shortcomings in the work and the edible oil trading market led by the state and without the participation of private merchants to adjust the surplus and deficiency among farmers has not yet been developed, coupled with the fact that the work of mobilizing farmers to increase the production of oil crops has not been done enough and the rural native pressing has not been well resolved, the supply of edible oil in rural areas is still felt to be in short supply. In order to ensure that there is more edible oil to supply the needs of the people of the whole country in 1955, the State Council of the Central People's Government issued instructions on September 19 on mobilizing farmers to increase the production of oil crops, requiring all localities to plan and organize farmers to increase the planting of oil crops suitable for growth according to local soil, climate, and other conditions.

### 国家对食用油品和油料实行统购统销  保证了城市和工矿区人民食油的供应

    国家对食用油品和油料实行统购统销
    保证了城市和工矿区人民食油的供应
    从去年十一月间，国家就开始对食用油品、油料实行了计划收购和在城市、工矿区普遍实行了食油计划供应。经过初步实施结果，有效地保证城市和工矿区人民食油供应和出口需要，打击了投机，稳定了油脂市场。到今年七月底，据不完全统计，全国实行计划供应的大、中、小城市已有二百四十四个。凡已实行计划供应的城市，市场稳定，供应正常。计划收购方面，在广大农民积极支持下，截至今年七月底，国家一九五三年度（自一九五三年第四季度到一九五四年第三季度新油登市止）的油品、油料收购计划，已完成百分之九十八点四五。
    全国解放后，我国食用油品和油料的生产，因为耕种面积的限制，再加上前几年财经工作部门缺乏预见，对适当鼓励和帮助农民增产油料作物注意不够，因而几年来油料作物生产的发展还没有达到抗日战争以前的水平。但和解放初比较生产是有发展的。一九五三年全国食油产量比一九五○年增加百分之二十九。目前我国食油表现出供不应求的特点主要因为在国家进入大规模的工业建设时期，随着人民购买力的不断提高，城乡食油的消费量逐年增长，并且这方面增长的速度比生产增长的速度快。据北京、天津、上海、武汉四个大城市统计，解放后几年来，每人平均食油消费量都是增加的。以北京为例，每人平均食油消费量，一九五零年为七斤多，一九五一年为十斤多，一九五二年为十一斤多，一九五三年为十三斤多。不仅城市如此，农村中农民也由过去不吃油少吃油改变为吃油量大增。
    为了保证全国人民的食油供应，国家从去年十一月间起对食用油品、油料采取了计划收购和在城市实行食油计划供应，以平衡产销。食油计划供应工作实行以来，不仅适当保证了大城市和工矿地区人民的食油供应，且适当照顾到广大农村增长的食油需要。国家从一九五三年第三季度油料上市到一九五四年油料上市以前这一生产年度中，计划收购的油料只占油料生产量的百分之六十五，还有百分之三十五的油料留在农村中，由农民自用和相互调剂。此外，国家又从计划收购进来的油料拿出百分之三十五调到农村，供应不种或少种油料作物的农户。
    国家在城市实行食油计划供应后，对私营油厂、油坊、油商都进行适当与慎重的处理和安置。由于采取了这些必要的措施，各大、中城市每月食油销售量较前有显著减少。北京、天津、上海、武汉、广州五大城市今年七月份销售量较计划供应前平均下降百分之十五点七六；中等城市如湖南省衡阳市四月份开始计划供应后，就较三月份销售量减少百分之二十九，五月份又比四月份减少百分之十三。
    在未实行计划供应前，上海食油市场曾因不法私商用拒售、抬价、套购、囤积等投机活动，捣乱市场，造谣惑众，造成消费者对食油的恐慌心理。上海全市食油最高销售量竟超过实际需要量三、四倍，中国油脂公司每月的销售计划经常被突破。实行计划供应后，不法私商的投机活动受到应有的打击，市场食油销售才恢复正常。在广大农村中，因为国家实行计划供应后，农村食油市场稳定。大多数农民对这一措施都能积极予以支持。少部分地区因为工作有缺点与由国家领导的、没有私商参加的农民相互调剂有无的食油交易市场还未开展起来，再加上发动农民增加油料作物生产的工作做得不够和农村土榨尚未很好解决，因而使农村食油供应仍感供不应求，为了保证一九五五年有更多的食油供应全国人民的需要。中央人民政府政务院于九月十九日发出关于发动农民增加油料作物生产的指示，要各地有计划、有组织地发动农民根据当地土壤、气候等条件增植适宜生长的油料作物。（新华社）
