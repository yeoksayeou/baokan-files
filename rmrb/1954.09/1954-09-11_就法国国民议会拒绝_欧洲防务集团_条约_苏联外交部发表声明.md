    Soviet Foreign Ministry Statement:

    The French National Assembly, on August 30th, rejected by an overwhelming majority the Paris Treaty, which aimed to establish an exclusive military bloc of six Western European nations (France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg) in the form of the so-called "European Defense Community." It is well known that the underlying plan for the aforementioned "group" was to revive German militarism, which poses a direct threat to the people of Europe.

    The failure of the plan to establish the aforementioned military bloc of six nations is a significant event in European political life. This fact demonstrates that the French people fully understand the danger posed by transforming West Germany into a militaristic state with its national destiny in the hands of German revanchists. This fact also illustrates the maturity of French patriotic forces, who correctly recognize that the establishment of the "European Defense Community" is a fatal threat to French security and a threat to French independence. To illustrate this point, one only needs to consider that if the Paris Treaty had been adopted, France would have lost its national army, resulting in all the consequences that would arise for France as a major power.

    The main task of the aforementioned military bloc was to establish a so-called "European Army," with the re-militarized armed forces of West Germany, led by former Hitlerite generals, serving as the main strike force of this army. This situation would create a serious danger for the people of Europe, especially for Germany's neighbors, because German militarists have never ceased seeking excuses to invade these countries. Historical experience shows that militaristic Germany is primarily a direct threat to France, which has been a victim of German aggression more than once.

    Supporters of the "European Defense Community," in order to deceive the people of all countries, including the French people, have been claiming that the failed Paris Treaty, if ratified, could limit West German armed forces to a certain range. However, any unbiased person can clearly see the hypocrisy of such claims. Even those who make such claims may not believe it themselves.

    Bonn's revanchists have become increasingly outspoken, not concealing their disregard for such claims on any occasion. They are now openly discussing plans to establish West German armies, planning to establish a number of West German divisions far exceeding the officially stipulated number. As for those formal conditions that seem to limit the quantity and armament of West German armies, experience has shown that German militarists will tear up any agreement whenever they believe that such agreements hinder the realization of their aggressive plans.

    Reviving German militarism and incorporating a re-militarized West Germany into military blocs will greatly increase the threat of a new war in Europe, and therefore the threat of a new world war. Looking at European history is enough to illustrate this point; even looking at the recent fifty years of European history, it can be seen that militaristic Germany has launched two wars in this period, bringing incalculable disasters to the people of Europe. The people of Europe, including the French people, remember these painful lessons, and therefore regard the "European Defense Community" plan as a direct threat to their own security and a threat of a new war with all its dangerous consequences. It has not been long since the European people experienced the Second World War, and their anxieties are fully understandable, because a new war would bring even greater and unparalleled sacrifices, material and human. This should be emphasized even more due to the emergence of atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, and other types of weapons of mass destruction. The anxieties of the people in the most densely populated areas of Europe are even easier to understand, as prosperous central cities of several countries are concentrated in these relatively limited territories, some of which have ancient monuments of material civilization and spiritual culture.

    Advocates of the policy of reviving German militarism are trying to make it seem as if West Germany's re-militarization and its inclusion in some military bloc of Western countries would strengthen the Western countries' position in negotiations with the Soviet Union on the German question. However, this assertion is completely unfounded. In reality, the situation is exactly the opposite. The militarization of West Germany and dragging West Germany into a military bloc would create insurmountable obstacles to the unification of Germany, thereby making it impossible to reach corresponding agreements on the German question. That is to say, the single German nation would remain divided into two parts indefinitely, a fact which in itself creates a dangerous situation for guaranteeing European peace, not to mention that it is against the interests of the German people and their natural desire for national unity.

    The failure of the "European Defense Community" treaty is undoubtedly a serious blow to the policy of establishing aggressive military blocs in Europe and other parts of the world. The planners of this policy are the ruling groups of the United States. However, it would be wrong to assume that because the formulators and supporters of this policy have suffered a setback due to the courageous actions of the French people, the people of all countries will relax their vigilance against the enemies of peace.

    It is well known that new plans to revive German militarism are now being openly discussed. Official figures in Western countries have launched a frenzied campaign to try to quickly agree to hold negotiations to formulate a new plan to drag West Germany into the military blocs of Western countries. The ruling groups of Western countries are trying to cobble together a new group of Western countries, this time with the participation of Britain, to replace the "European Defense Community" in order to achieve the militarization of Germany. At the same time, they are trying to maintain silence about the Soviet Union's proposals of July 24th and August 4th this year regarding the German question and the establishment of a European collective security system.

    Plans to directly pull West Germany into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in order to clear the way for the re-militarization of West Germany occupy a particularly important position in the plans to revive West German militarism.

    Those who propose this plan do not conceal that they are doing so in order to circumvent the obstacles encountered in France by the advocates of the long-discredited "policy of strength." In other words, they are trying to cobble together another bloc with the participation of a re-militarized West Germany to replace the aggressive military bloc in the form of the "European Defense Community," and they are trying to use this new label to cover up this bloc and deceive the French people.

    Therefore, it is appropriate to point out at this time that no guise can conceal the plan to restore German militarism, and the inevitable consequence of realizing this plan is that West Germany will become a hotbed of new wars and the existing division of Germany will be further deepened.

    For the sake of European security and for the sake of the German people's interests, the German question must be resolved on the principle of establishing a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany, as originally stipulated in the agreements between the major powers. It cannot be said that the possibility of reaching an agreement on the German question no longer exists. The Soviet government, precisely because it takes this into consideration, proposed to the governments of France, Britain, and the United States that another Four-Power conference be held in August and September of this year to discuss the German question, but the three governments have not yet responded.

    The French National Assembly's rejection of the "European Defense Community" treaty once again proves how much the policy of establishing mutually hostile military blocs in Europe goes against the interests of the people. The French Parliament rejected the aforementioned treaty despite crude foreign pressure; this decision is a profound patriotic action, prompted by the need to guarantee France's genuine security and safeguard France's national independence. These national interests of France are in line with, and cannot but be in line with, the requirements for guaranteeing pan-European security. It is precisely for this reason that this decision of the French Parliament has been welcomed with satisfaction by those who, not only in words but also in deeds, safeguard the peace and security of the people of all countries.

    In order to ensure pan-European security, it is imperative not to cobble together exclusive military blocs in Europe, but to establish a collective security system in which all European countries, regardless of their social system, can participate.

    The draft "Pan-European Treaty on Guaranteeing European Collective Security" proposed by the Soviet Union, as well as the proposal to hold a pan-European conference to discuss relevant proposals, are in line with these goals.

    Establishing a European collective security system and, to this end, signing a pan-European treaty with the participation of both eastern and western parts of Germany (or a unified Germany after the two parts are merged) would promote the resolution of the German question in a way that enables Germany to achieve national unification on a peaceful and democratic basis. This is in line with the security interests of all European countries, including France, because its destiny as a major power is inseparable from the destiny of the entire Europe. Only the peaceful development of Europe and the establishment of a unified and peaceful Germany can guarantee that France maintains its rightful position among other major powers. Conversely, if there are mutually opposed military blocs in Europe, and if there is a militaristic West Germany in the center of Europe, then France will be reduced to a second-rate power. The Soviet Union has always advocated a strong and independent France, because only such a France is an important factor in maintaining peace in Europe and the world.

    The experience of the Geneva Conference, which made a significant contribution to easing international tensions, once again shows that it is possible to reach agreements on outstanding issues that are in line with the interests of consolidating peace, as long as the countries concerned have a genuine desire.

    As for the Soviet Union, it will continue to do everything possible to strive for agreements on a number of outstanding international issues, such as the German question, the European collective security system, the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and the reduction of national armaments, in order to further ease international tensions.

    就法国国民议会拒绝“欧洲防务集团”条约
    苏联外交部发表声明
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十日电：
    苏联外交部声明：
    法国国民议会八月三十日以绝大多数票拒绝了目的在于以所谓“欧洲防务集团”的形式建立西欧六国（法国、西德、意大利、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡）的排他军事集团的巴黎条约。大家知道，上述
  “集团”的幕后计划就是复活德国军国主义，而这是对欧洲各国人民的直接威胁。
    建立上述六个国家军事集团的计划的破产，是欧洲政治生活中的重大事件。这个事实证明，法国人是充分地了解到了把西德变为由德国复仇主义者掌握国家命运的军国主义国家因而所产生的危险。这个事实还说明了法国爱国力量的成熟程度，他们正确地认为“欧洲防务集团”的建立是对法国安全的致命威胁，是对法国独立的威胁。要说明这点，只要看看：如果通过了巴黎条约，法国就要失去自己的国家军队，从而使作为一个大国的法国遭到由此而产生的一切后果。
    上述军事集团的主要任务是：建立一支所谓
  “欧洲军”，并由以前希特勒的将领们统率的重新军国主义化的西德的武装力量作为这支军队的主要突击力量。这种局势会给欧洲各国人民，首先是给德国的邻国造成严重的危险，因为德国军国主义者从来没有停止过寻找借口侵犯这些国家。历史经验表明，军国主义的德国首先是法国的直接威胁，法国曾不止一次地首先成为德国侵略的牺牲品。
    “欧洲防务集团”的支持者为了欺骗包括法国人民在内的各国人民，过去和现在一直在把事情说成这样：破了产的巴黎条约如果被批准了的话，它是可以把西德军队限制在某种一定的范围以内的。但是，每一个没有偏见的人都会清楚地看出这类说法的虚伪性。就是说那些话的人自己也未必会相信这一点。
    波恩复仇主义者已越来越直言无讳，他们在任何场合都并不掩饰，他们不重视这种说法，他们现在明目张胆地讨论着建立西德军队的计划，他们计划建立西德师的数目大大超过官方规定的数目。至于说到那些似乎可以限制西德军队的数量和武装的各种形式上的条件，那末根据经验，德国军国主义者只要认为他们所参加的那些协定阻碍着他们实现侵略计划时，他们是会撕毁任何协定的。
    复活德国军国主义和吸收重新军国主义化的西德加入军事集团，会无比地增加欧洲新战争的威胁，因而也就增加新世界大战的威胁。看一看欧洲的历史就足以说明这点了，即使看看最近五十年的欧洲历史就可以看出，军国主义的德国在这一个阶段中已两次发动战争，给欧洲人民带来无法估计的灾难。欧洲各国人民、包括法国人民在内，记得这些沉痛的教训，因此把“欧洲防务集团”计划看成是对自己安全的直接威胁和带有一切危险后果的新战争的威胁。欧洲人民经历第二次世界大战为时并不很远，他们的不安是完全可以理解的，因为新的战争会比过去的战争带来更大得无可比拟的牺牲、物力和人类的牺牲。由于原子弹、氢弹和其他类型的大规模毁灭性武器的出现，就更加应当着重指明这一点。欧洲人口最稠密的那些地区的人民的不安心理是更容易理解的了，在这些比较有限的领土上集中了若干国家的繁华的中心城市，其中有些大城市拥有悠久的物质文明和精神文化的古迹。
    复活德国军国主义政策的拥护者力图把事情说成这样，仿佛西德的重新军国主义化和吸收西德参加西方国家的某种军事集团，就会加强西方国家同苏联就德国问题进行谈判时的地位。但是，这种断言是丝毫没有根据的。实际上，情况完全与此相反。西德军国主义化和把西德拖入某一军事集团，就会为德国的统一造成不可克服的障碍，从而使就德国问题达成相应的协议成为不可能。这就是说，单一的德意志民族会仍然被无限期地分裂为两部分，这一事实本身就为保障欧洲和平造成危险的局面，更不用说，这是违反德国人民的利益和他们要求民族统一的自然愿望的。
    “欧洲防务集团”条约的失败无疑对于在欧洲和世界其他地区建立侵略性的军事集团的政策是一个严重的打击。这种政策的策划者是美国统治集团。但是，如果设想，由于法国人民的勇敢行动，这种政策的制订者和拥护者遭到了失败，各国人民就会放松他们对和平敌人的警惕，那就错了。
    大家知道，现在已经公开讨论起新的复活德国军国主义的计划来了。西方国家的官方人士展开狂热的活动，企图尽速商定举行谈判，来制订一个把西德拖入西方国家的军事集团的新计划。西方国家的统治集团企图拼凑一个新的、这一次是有英国参加的西方国家集团来代替“欧洲防务集团”，以便实现德国的军国主义化。同时，他们对苏联在今年七月二十四日和八月四日提出的关于德国问题和建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议，竭力保持缄默。
    把西德直接拉入北大西洋集团以便为西德重新军国主义化扫清道路的计划在复活西德军国主义的计划中占特别重要的地位。
    提出这种计划的人并不隐讳，这样做是为了绕过久已声名狼藉的“实力政策”的拥护者在法国碰到的障碍。换句话说，就是要拼凑另外一个有重新军国主义化的西德参加的集团来代替以“欧洲防务集团”的形式出现的侵略军事集团，他们企图用这块新招牌来遮掩这个集团而欺骗法国人。
    为此，现在就指出这一点是适宜的：任何幌子都掩饰不了恢复德国军国主义的计划，实现这种计划的必然后果是西德变为新战争的温床和德国现有的分裂进一步加深。
    为欧洲安全的利益、为德国人民的利益着想，都必须以建立统一、和平和民主的德国为原则来解决德国问题，这也是大国之间的各个协议原来所规定的。不能说，就德国问题达成协议的可能已经没有了。苏联政府正因为考虑到这一点，才向法国、英国和美国三国政府建议在今年八、九月间再一次举行四大国会议讨论德国问题，但三国政府直到现在还没有作答复。
    法国国民议会拒绝了“欧洲防务集团”条约，这再一次证明，在欧洲建立互相敌对的军事集团的政策是多么违背人民的利益。法国议会不顾粗暴的外国压力而拒绝了上述条约，这种决定是一种深刻的爱国行动，是保障法国真正的安全和维护法国民族独立的要求所促成的。法国的这些民族利益符合于、也不可能不符合于保障全欧安全的要求。正因为这样，法国议会的这一决定才得到那些不仅是在口头上、而且在行动上维护各国人民的和平和安全的人的满意的欢迎。
    为了保证全欧安全，决不能在欧洲拼凑起排他的军事集团，而必须建立起一切欧洲国家不问社会制度如何都可以参加的集体安全体系。
    苏联提出的“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”草案，以及建议举行全欧会议来讨论有关建议，都是符合这些目的的。
    建立欧洲集体安全体系，并为此而签订有德国东西两部（两部合并后则由统一的德国）参加的全欧条约，就能按照使德国在和平、民主的基础上实现民族统一的方式，促进德国问题的解决。这符合一切欧洲国家的安全的利益，也包括法国在内，因为它作为一个大国的命运是和整个欧洲的命运分不开的。只有欧洲的和平发展和建立起一个统一和平的德国才能保证法国在其他大国中保持应有的大国地位。相反，欧洲如果出现了互相对立的军事集团，欧洲中心如果有着一个军国主义的西德，那末就会使法国降到二等国的地位。苏联过去和现在一直主张有一个强大和独立的法国。因为只有这样的法国才是维护欧洲和世界和平的重要因素。
    对缓和国际局势作出了重大贡献的日内瓦会议的经验再一次表明了：只要有关国家具有真正的愿望，是有可能就悬而未决的问题取得符合巩固和平的利益的协议的。
    至于苏联，它今后仍将尽一切可能争取就一些悬而未决的国际问题，如德国问题、欧洲集体安全体系问题、禁止原子武器和氢武器问题、裁减各国军备问题等达成协议，以便进一步缓和国际局势。
