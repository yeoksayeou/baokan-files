	Taking a bus from Liu'an city to Meishan, you can reach the Meishan Reservoir, one of the key projects for harnessing the Huai River, which is being accelerated in the Dabie Mountains, in just over three hours. After the completion of this reservoir, it will hold back more than 1.7 billion cubic meters of floodwater from the Shi River (according to the latest design). This will not only reduce the threat of floods to the people on both sides of the Shi and Huai Rivers, but also bring new conditions for the prosperity of the mountain economy. Now, the new Jinzhai county town is to be built in Meishan, where land and water transportation is smooth, becoming a new economic hub in the Dabie Mountains. This future mountain city has already had its magnificent outline planned in the lush mountains. Soon, this newly built city will bloom like a flower from the reservoir.

	We visited this future city before the arrival of National Day. In this narrow area surrounded by mountains, nearly ten thousand workers and laborers are drawing a picture of a happy life with their wisdom and labor. They have completed the 259-meter-long tunnel project of the Meishan Reservoir. Before National Day, they will also strive to complete the closure of the upstream cofferdam of the reservoir. The brick kiln workers, who supply the city's construction needs, are rushing to prepare brick blanks by diverting soil; farmers from hundreds of miles away are transporting bamboo, wood and firewood to here day and night to welcome the birth of this city. The city's designers are concentrating on planning the city's drawings. A city designer told us from the city planning sketch: that is the giant arch bridge spanning the Shi River, which echoes the more than 80-meter-high arch dam of the reservoir between the large and small Meishan mountains. Crossing the arch bridge over the Shi River, on the west side of the river is a 40,000-square-meter park, where the future Meishan People's Hall and Workers' Cultural Palace will be built. Outside the park, there are wide and clean roads running vertically and horizontally. The area of the reservoir management office is south of the park, and the hydropower station with a power generation of 24,000 kilowatts and the recuperation center, which can overlook the "artificial lake", the arch dam and the whole city, are also located here. The location of the residential area is on the north and south sides of the park. To the west of the park is the market area, which is adjacent to the government office area. Two or three miles north along the park is the preliminary planned factory area. They will bring new prosperity to the rich Dabie Mountains, which are rich in bamboo, wood, tea, hemp and grain. At that time, the ships on the upper reaches of the Shi River and the cars leading to Meishan will also become gathering points here. After the completion of the reservoir, the ferocious Shi River will flow quietly from the reservoir to the tree-lined road beside the park. In the beautiful environment of Dagongling in the suburbs, a middle school that can accommodate 2,000 students will soon be started.

	Now, from morning to night, state-owned department stores, food companies, shops, supply and marketing cooperatives, and Xinhua bookstores, which have moved here from Jinzhai, Mabao and other places, are receiving their new customers. In the past, the residents here had to travel dozens of miles to buy oil and salt, but now they can get these daily necessities locally; and they can eat Shandong apples, Fujian lychees, Zhenjiang shrimp paste soy sauce, and use daily necessities transported from Shanghai and other places.

	This construction picture of creating a happy life encourages the people participating in the construction to work with selfless labor. Liang Yongzhi, the bulldozer driver who won the first-class merit in the People's Liberation Army, when he passed through Meishan in 1949 during the suppression of bandits in the Dabie Mountains, Meishan was still a sparsely populated mountain valley, but now he is extremely excited to see this new city under construction. Due to his selfless labor, he was recently named a first-class hero. Communist Party member Ma Yansen, a driller, when his wife, who had been separated for six years, came to Meishan, it was the busiest time of work. Although the construction site and the family were only separated by a river, he did not bother to go home for 60 consecutive days in order to complete the task ahead of schedule. After the construction of Meishan started, the nearby farmers came to visit the construction scene continuously. They said in surprise: "Socialism in the mountains is coming so fast!" After visiting the construction of Meishan, the representatives attending the Meishan Mutual Aid and Cooperation Representatives Conference immediately wrote a letter to the workers, guaranteeing to do a good job in mutual aid and cooperation and produce more grain to support industrial construction. Chen Heqing, who participated in the revolutionary work during the domestic revolutionary war in 1929, was even more delighted to see the construction scene in Meishan today. He would rather give up 12 acres of paddy fields to the state to build a new city for the benefit of the people, and actively switch to restoring and developing tea production together with the mutual aid group members. Farmer Yang Dengyun said: "Our Meishan, where leopards and wild boars are in groups, has become a lively town, and no one will dislike our mountains for being poor and bitter anymore!"

    正在建设的梅山
    新华社记者　石正章　龚灏
    从六安城坐上去梅山的汽车，三个多钟头便可到达大别山区正在加速建设的治淮重要工程之一的梅山水库。由于这座水库建成以后，它要拦住史河十七亿多立方公尺的洪水（按新近的设计），这不仅对史河和淮河两岸的人民减去洪水的威胁，并且对繁荣山区的经济带来新的条件。现在新的金寨县城就要在水陆交通畅达的梅山建设起来，成为大别山区一个新的经济枢纽。这座未来的山色之城已在草木茂密的山野规划出了它的瑰丽的轮廓。不久，这座新建的城市就像是水库的一个花朵开放出来。
    我们在国庆节来临之前访问了这座未来之城。在这个四面环山的狭长地带里，近万名的工人和民工以他们的智慧和劳动绘制着一幅幸福生活的图景。他们已经完成了梅山水库的二百五十九公尺长的隧洞工程。国庆日前，他们还要争取完成水库上游围坝合拢的工程。为供应城市建设需要的砖窑工人们，正在调土赶制砖坯；百里内外的农民，为了迎接这座城市的诞生，在日夜不停地向这里运送着竹木和柴草。城市的设计人员正在聚精会神地为这座城市规划图样。一位城市设计人员从城市规划的草图上告诉我们：那是横架在史河上的巨型拱桥，他和介于大小梅山之间的八十多公尺高的水库连拱坝互相辉映。跨过史河拱桥，在河的西面是一个面积四万平方公尺的公园，将来的梅山人民大会堂和工人文化宫就要建设在这里。园外纵横着宽阔洁净的马路。公园南面为水库的管理所区域，两万四千瓩发电量的水力发电站以及可以居高瞩远俯瞰“人造湖”、连拱坝和城市全貌的休养所也设在这里。居民住宅区的位置在公园的南北两侧。公园的西面是和政府机关区毗连的市场区。沿公园往北再走两三华里，就是初步规划的工厂区。它们将给盛产竹、木、茶、麻和粮食的富饶的大别山区带来新的繁荣。那时，史河上游的轮船和通往梅山的汽车也将在这里成为会集点。水库建成以后，凶暴的史河便会从水库到公园的林荫道旁静静流过。在城郊大龚岭的幽美环境里，一个可容二千名学生的中学已经快要动工了。
    现在，从清晨到夜晚，已从金寨、麻埠等地迁到这里来的国营百货公司、食品公司、商店、供销合作社和新华书店等，都在接待着它们的新顾客。从前这里的居民要跑到几十里路以外的地方去买油买盐，现在他们就地得到了这些生活用品的供应；而且可以吃到山东的苹果、福建的荔枝、镇江的虾子酱油，用到上海等地运来的日用百货。
    这幅创造幸福生活的建设图景，鼓舞着参加建设的人们以忘我的劳动工作着。在人民解放军部队里曾立过一等功的开山机驾驶员梁永芝，在一九四九年进入大别山区剿匪路过梅山时，梅山还是一个人烟稀少的山沟，而现在他目睹这个开始建设的新城市，感到极大的兴奋。由于他忘我的劳动，最近他已被评为一等功臣。共产党员、把钻工马延森，在他分离了六年的妻子来到梅山时，正是工作最紧张的时候，虽然工地和家庭只有一河之隔，但他为了提前完成工作任务，连续六十天没有顾得回家。梅山建设动工后，附近的农民陆续不断地来参观建设的情景。他们惊喜地说：“山区社会主义来得这样快！”参加梅山区互助合作代表会议的代表参观过梅山的建设以后，立即给工人写了信，保证要搞好互助合作，多打粮食来支援工业建设。曾经在一九二九年的国内革命战争时期参加了革命工作的陈和清，看到今天梅山的建设景象，心里更是喜悦。他宁愿为了人民的利益把十二亩水田让给国家建设新城市，而自己和互助组员一道积极转入恢复和发展茶叶生产。农民杨登云说：“我们豹子、野猪成群结队的梅山，已经成了热闹的市镇了，再不会有人嫌我们山里穷、山里苦了！”
