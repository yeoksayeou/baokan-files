    A Village in a Cotton-Producing Area

    Unbelievable Figures
    While perusing the work summary of the West Liang Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yicheng, Shanxi, led by Wu Chun'an (who is a National People's Congress representative), I discovered two unbelievable figures in the income distribution column: In 1952, the average cotton and grain income per member of the cooperative was 4,739 jin of wheat; in 1953, due to disaster and reduced production, the average income per person was still 2,054 jin. I suspected that the statistician had mistakenly used the number of households as the population number, or had made a mistake in the number of digits. After repeated calculations, there was no mistake at all. According to this figure: In 1952, each member's income was enough to eat white flour and wear fine cloth, plus daily expenses, for three years; in 1953, each member's income was still enough to eat for two years.
    The houses where the farmers of West Liang Village live are all neat and tidy; the remnants of the destruction by the Japanese invaders and Yan bandit troops are no longer visible.
    In the dozen or so cooperative member households I visited, I saw that two out of three meals were white flour. It is said that this was still after the promotion of increasing production and practicing economy last autumn, when they substituted coarse grains for fine grains for one meal. Each family's kang (platform bed) was covered with piles of colorful bedding. Young women mostly wore sweaters and sneakers. An old man named Wang Zhihong even spent 150,000 yuan to buy a pair of leather shoes. Many families also have thermos bottles and bicycles. Rain boots are even more common, with adults, children, and even old ladies each having a pair. At night, pedestrians on the street mostly carry bright flashlights. In the club, cooperative members listen to songs broadcast on the radio under the bright light of gasoline lamps. It is said that a cooperative member named Liu Guilan is considered relatively poor; her husband joined the workforce early, and she alone participates in labor, while also raising her mother-in-law and a child. When I went to her house, she was not there. From talking with her mother-in-law, I learned that they not only eat white flour all year round, but the old lady also often eats sweets, eggs, and beef; during the grain sales campaign, they sold a total of 1,100 jin of wheat to the state, and also invested 4 million yuan in the cooperative.
    The Struggle at the "Crossroads"
    The members of this village are all very talkative. When asked how they obtained such a good life, almost everyone started from the land reform in 1947. The most noteworthy year was 1951. Cooperative member Wei Bingde described that year as "overthrowing the emperor and becoming the emperor." The meaning is: after the land reform, out of the 47 households in the village, 8 households hired long-term laborers. Xu Huaiyi, who became impoverished at that time, told me: Before the land reform, he had worked as a long-term laborer for landlords and rich peasants for more than 20 years. After the land reform, he was allocated 24.6 mu of land, a mule, and five rooms. Because he lacked a foundation in the past and had not engaged in independent production, he borrowed 1,700 jin of grain at an interest rate of "plus five" when he started production. He could not afford both food and supplies for the land, and his life became worse every year. He sold the mule for an ox; then he sold one ox for half an ox; finally, he had no choice but to sell all the oxen and carts, and planned to sell the land and become a tenant farmer.
    Later, the Yicheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party educated the West Liang Village branch on the socialist future and the party's leadership responsibilities, pointing out that hiring long-term laborers and lending at usurious rates was taking the capitalist road and was wrong. Wu Chun'an, who was then the deputy secretary of the branch, could not accept this criticism, and argued, "Hiring long-term laborers is to allow me to devote more time to work; lending at usurious rates is to solve people's difficulties." The county committee prompted him to recall his past suffering; to think about whether lending at usurious rates and hiring long-term laborers had increased difficulties for farmers or relieved them. A picture of suffering unfolded before Wu Chun'an's eyes: When he was in his old home in Henan, he was exploited by landlords and rich peasants. When he encountered famine years, he could not repay the rent and debts, and was driven out of the house by the landlord, which is why he drifted to Shanxi; after arriving in Shanxi, he saw that the hearts of all the landlords and rich peasants in the world were generally ruthless, and he was not even allowed to live in a large doorway at night, and was driven away everywhere. His father sold vegetables, his mother did needlework for others, and he worked as a long-term laborer, but he could not maintain his life. He had no choice but to sell his younger brother and sister. When Wu Chun'an thought of this, he couldn't help but burst into tears. He also thought that after liberation, the people who worked as long-term laborers for him and borrowed his debts were not becoming richer day by day, but becoming poorer day by day. He began to feel that if he did not lead everyone to take the road of collective prosperity, and continued like this, he did not know how many people would have to take the old road he had taken. Class consciousness prompted him to make a painful self-criticism. He said: I am sorry for the party's cultivation and leadership, sorry for the sister and brother who were sold, and sorry for the farmers in the village who lived in poverty. He made a guarantee: to lead the farmers in the village to take the road of organization and live a collectively prosperous life. He immediately took out 2,300 jin of surplus grain and lent it to poor households without interest to help them tide over the spring famine. Under his influence, party members and emancipated farmers who had hired long-term laborers all voluntarily dismissed the long-term laborers and organized them to participate in production together. In the spring of 1951, he began to lead the establishment of a mutual aid team.
    How the Golden Star Medal Was Obtained
    Some cooperative members felt a little funny when talking about the road they had traveled. When organizing mutual aid teams, most farmers did not believe that mutual aid was better than individual farming. They believed that "too many people make a mess, and too many chickens don't lay eggs." Wu Chun'an led three party members and one emancipated farmer to organize a five-household mutual aid team, intending to first set an example for everyone to see. If there were difficulties in production supplies, Wu Chun'an would take out his surplus grain and cotton and sell them into fertilizer for everyone to use. When cultivating the land, he bought a new-style plough, pulled by two animals, which cultivated faster and deeper. When sowing cotton, Wu Chun'an traveled more than 400 li to Jie County to buy 160 jin of Si Zi cotton seeds. When cotton aphids occurred, they also jointly purchased insecticides and sprayers. These were things that individual farmers could not do. This year, the mutual aid team averaged 270 jin of cotton per mu, and the highest was 520 jin; while individual farmers only averaged 150 jin per mu. Everyone saw that mutual aid teams were indeed better than individual farming, and by the spring of 1952, seven more mutual aid teams had been added to the village.
    At this time, Wu Chun'an's mutual aid team proposed to transform into an agricultural production cooperative. People were again skeptical, feeling that cooperatives were not necessarily better than teams. Landlords and rich peasant elements also took the opportunity to spread rumors, saying: Wu Chun'an is leading everyone to communalize everything, and after the cooperative is established, everyone will eat from the big pot. Most middle peasants were uneasy, and even didn't speak to Wu Chun'an when they saw him. Farmers from other villages also came to inquire about "how to communalize" and "how to eat from the big pot." In order to counter the sabotage of landlords and rich peasants and dispel the misunderstandings of the masses, Wu Chun'an explained to all the farmers in detail the organizational methods and profit-sharing methods of the agricultural production cooperative, and exposed the landlords' and rich peasants' conspiracy to sabotage the agricultural production cooperative in order to restore their rule and exploitation of the peasants. After everyone understood the benefits of the cooperative, five members from other mutual aid teams voluntarily requested to join the cooperative.
    After the cooperative was established, they paid even more attention to improving technology. Wu Chun'an visited Qu Yaoli in Jie County twice to learn about his experience in high cotton yields; in order to increase wheat yields, Wu Chun'an ran to Quwo to exchange for "Dayang wheat" seeds, and also learned the high-yield experience of Zhang Deyou, a wheat high-yield model in Zhaocheng. Some mutual aid teams and individual households competing with the agricultural production cooperative had proposed: "Whatever the cooperative can do, we can also do." The result? The mutual aid teams didn't even do half of what the agricultural production cooperative did, and individual farmers were even less able to compare with the cooperative. The result of the autumn harvest: the agricultural production cooperative averaged 472 jin of seed cotton per mu, with the highest being 1,021 jin and six liang per mu. Each member of the cooperative averaged 1,514 and a half jin of seed cotton and 1,459 jin of wheat, which was 60 percent more than the average income per member of the mutual aid team and 150 percent more than the average income per member of the individual farmer. Cooperative director Wu Chun'an was therefore awarded the Patriotic High-Yield Golden Star Medal issued by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government.
    Cooperative member Wei Bingde said: "This year, everyone bought a lot of printed cloth, those who could ride bicycles bought bicycles, and young women bought sweaters and sneakers... What's most interesting is that people in the surrounding villages still didn't believe that we were so rich. A farmer who came to visit from another village went to the homes of cooperative members to look for empty urns everywhere. He found a covered urn, opened the lid, and it seemed to be empty. He stretched out his arm and touched it," Wei Bingde stood up, making a gesture of reaching into the urn with his arm, and shouted 'Too bad!' and splashed a sleeve full of oil. It turned out that the urn contained half an urn of cottonseed oil. The surrounding onlookers laughed heartily. This farmer no longer looked for empty urns in other homes, said 'I'm convinced,' and went to the side to wipe off the oil."
    Seeing that the agricultural production cooperative was indeed good, all the members of the mutual aid teams and individual farmers in the village, except for three landlords and rich peasants who had not changed their status, voluntarily requested to join the cooperative in 1953; nine farmers from the Zhaizi Village, two li away from West Liang Village, also joined the cooperative, and all achieved "cultivating one and having a surplus of two" even in the face of four insect plagues.

    棉产区的一个村庄
    晋闻
    令人难以相信的数字
    我在翻阅吴春安（他是全国人民代表大会代表）领导的山西翼城西梁村农业生产合作社的工作总结的时候，在收益分配栏内，发现了两个难以令人相信的数目字：一九五二年，每个社员人口收入的棉、粮平均是四千七百三十九斤小麦；一九五三年因灾减产，平均每人的收入仍有两千零五十四斤。我怀疑统计的人不是以户数作为人口数弄错了，就是弄错了数目字的位数。经反复查算，一点也没有弄错。按这个数字计算：一九五二年每个社员人口的收入，光吃白面、穿细布，加上日常开支，足够三年吃用；一九五三年每个社员人口的收入，同样也还够吃用二年。
    西梁村农民们住的房屋，都是整整齐齐的；日寇、阎匪破坏的残迹，已经看不到了。
    在访问过的十几户社员中，我看到三顿饭就有两顿是吃白面。据说，这还是自去秋提倡增产节约后，“以粗代细”了一顿。各家的炕上，都放着大老高的花花被褥。年轻的妇女们大都穿着毛衣、球鞋。一个叫王志宏的老汉，还用十五万元买了一双皮鞋穿。不少人家还有暖水壶、自行车。雨鞋更是普遍，大人、小孩，甚至老太太，都是每人一双。入夜，街上来往的行人，多是拿着明晃晃的手电灯。俱乐部里，社员们在白亮的汽灯光下，听着收音机放送的歌曲。据说，一个叫刘桂兰的社员，算是比较困难的了；她的丈夫早参加了工作，只她一个人参加劳动，还养着婆母和一个小孩。我去她家时，她不在。从和她的婆母的谈话中了解，她们不但常年吃白面，这位老太太还经常吃糖果、鸡蛋、牛肉；在售粮运动中，她们共卖给了国家一千一百斤小麦，另外还在社内投资四百万元。
    在“十字路口”上的斗争
    这村的社员们都很健谈。在问到他们这样美好的生活是怎样得来的时候，差不多每个人都是从一九四七年土地改革谈到现在。这几年里最引人注意的是一九五一年。社员卫丙德把那一年形容成是“打倒皇上坐皇上”。意思是说：土地改革以后，全村四十七户，又有八户雇上了长工。就在那时贫困下来的徐怀义告诉我说：土地改革前他给地主、富农扛了二十多年长工，土地改革后他曾分到二十四亩六分地、一头骡子、五间房。因他过去缺少底垫，又没独立地进行过生产，开始生产时，就以“加五”利息，借了一千七百斤粮食。顾吃顾不了地里底垫，生活过得一年不如一年，就把骡子变卖成了牛；后又把一条牛，变卖成半条牛；最后没办法，就把牛和车全部卖了，并且计划把地卖了当佃户。
    后来，中共翼城县委对西梁村支部进行了社会主义前途和党的领导责任的教育，指出雇长工、放高利贷，是走了资本主义道路，是错误的。吴春安当时是支部副书记，他接受不了这个批评，并且辩驳说：“雇长工是为了使我抽出更多时间参加工作；放高利贷是为了解决人们的困难。”县委启发他回忆过去的苦难历史；想一想放高利贷、雇长工是给农民增加了困难，还是给农民解除了困难。一幅苦难的图画在吴春安的眼前展开了：在老家河南时，受地主富农剥削，遇到荒年时，还不了租债，被地主扫地出门，才流落到山西；到山西后，又看到天下地主、富农的心都是一般狠，夜里连个大门洞都不让住，到处被赶着走。父亲卖菜，母亲给人家做针线，自己扛长工，也维持不住生活，没法子，又把自己的弟弟姐姐卖了。吴春安想到这里，忍不住抱头痛哭起来。他又想到解放后，给他扛长工的人，借他债的人，都不是一天一天富裕了，而是一天一天贫困了。他开始感到：如果不领导大家走集体富裕的道路，照这样下去，不知要有多少人要走他过去走过的老路。阶级觉悟促使他作了沉痛的检讨。他说：我对不起党的培养和领导，对不起被卖掉的姐姐和弟弟，也对不起全村过贫困生活的农民。他提出保证：要领导全村农民走组织起来的道路，过集体富裕的生活。他当即拿出两千三百斤余粮，无利地借给贫困户，帮助他们渡过春荒。在他的影响下，雇上了长工的党员和翻身农民，都自动地解雇了长工，并且组织他们一起参加了生产。一九五一年春天，他开始领导建立了一个互助组。
    金星奖章是怎样得来的
    有些社员在谈起他们走过的道路时，都感到有些好笑。在组织互助组时，一般农民都不相信互助比单干好。他们认为“人多瞎胡乱，鸡多不下蛋”。吴春安便领导着三个党员和一户翻身农民，组织了一个五户的互助组，打算先做出个样子来给大家看。生产底垫有困难，吴春安就把自己的余粮、余棉拿出来，变卖成肥料借给大家用。耕地时买了一张新式步犁，用两个牲口拉，耕得又快又深。到棉田播种时，吴春安又往返四百多里地，到解县买回了一百六十斤斯字棉籽。棉花发生了棉蚜时，他们又合买了杀虫药和喷雾器。这些是单干农民都没做到的。这一年，互助组每亩棉花平均收到了二百七十斤，最高的收到了五百二十斤；而单干农民，每亩平均才收到一百五十斤。大家看到互助组就是比单干好，到一九五二年春，全村就又增加了七个互助组。
    这时，吴春安互助组又提出转农业生产合作社了。人们又发生了怀疑，觉得社不一定比组好。地主富农分子也趁机造谣，说：吴春安领导大家共产了，成立起社后，就要吃大锅饭。一般中农都惶惶不安，见了吴春安连话也不说。外村的农民也来打听“怎样共产”，“大锅饭怎样吃法”。吴春安为了反击地主富农的破坏、解除群众的误解，便向全体农民详细地宣传了农业生产合作社的组织办法和分红方法，并揭露地主、富农对农业生产合作社进行破坏，是为了恢复他们对农民的统治剥削的阴谋。当大家了解了社的好处以后，就有其它互助组的五户组员，自动要求入社。
    社成立起来以后，他们更加注意提高技术了。吴春安两次到解县访问了曲耀离的棉花丰产经验；为了提高小麦产量，吴春安又跑到曲沃调换来了“大洋麦”籽，又学习了赵城小麦丰产模范张德有的丰产经验。一些和农业生产合作社竞赛的互助组、单干户曾提出：“社里能做到那一点，我们就也能做到那一点。”结果呢？互助组连农业生产合作社做的活一半都没有，单干农民就更没法和社比了。秋收的结果：农业生产合作社每亩棉花平均收到了籽棉四百七十二斤，最高每亩收到了一千零二十一斤六两。每个社员人口平均收到了籽棉一千五百一十四斤半，小麦一千四百五十九斤，比互助组员人口每人平均收入多百分之六十，比单干农民人口每人平均收入多百分之一百五十。社长吴春安因此荣获了中央人民政府农业部颁发的爱国丰产金星奖章。
    社员卫丙德说：“这年各家都买了不少花布，会骑自行车的就买自行车，年轻的妇女们就买毛衣、球鞋……。最有趣的是周围村子的人还不相信我们这样富裕。有一个外村来参观的农民，到各社员家到处找空甕。他发现一个盖着的甕，掀开盖一看，似乎是空的。他伸胳膊一摸”，卫丙德立起来，做着胳膊向甕中伸的姿势，喊了一声‘真糟糕！’一下涮了他一袖子油。原来甕中盛着半甕棉籽油。周围看的人，哈哈大笑了一通。这位农民再也不到别家找空甕了，说了声‘我信服了’，就到一边擦油去了。”
    全村互助组员、单干农民看到农业生产合作社确实好，到一九五三年，除三户没改变成份的地主、富农外，全部自动要求入了社；离西梁村二里地的寨子村的九户农民，也来参加了这个社，并且在四次受虫灾的情况下，也全部达到了“耕一余二”。
