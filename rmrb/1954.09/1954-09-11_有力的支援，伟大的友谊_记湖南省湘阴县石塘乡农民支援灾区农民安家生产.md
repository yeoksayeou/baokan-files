Powerful Support, Great Friendship
    ——A Record of Farmers in Shiqiao Township, Xiangyin County, Hunan Province Supporting Disaster-stricken Farmers to Settle Down and Resume Production
    By our reporter Li Wen, New Hunan Daily reporter Jian Chu
    First Day's Observations
    On August 19th, we arrived in Shiqiao Township, Xiangyin County, Hunan Province. It had been one month and four days since the farmers from Wangjia Township were relocated here to settle down and resume production after the Xiangbin Dyke on the shore of Dongting Lake breached.
    We headed towards Han's Grand House. This was a "compound" with over a hundred rooms, where members of the Dongtingwei Agricultural Production Cooperative from Wangjia Township were staying. We entered a spacious and bright hall. Along one side of the room were six large sleeping platforms, each with a straw mat and mosquito net. Although a bit crowded, everything was neat and tidy. On the other side was a large octagonal table and an armchair. On the table were thick stacks of ledgers, pens, ink, and a shaded kerosene lamp. This served as the temporary office and residence of the Dongtingwei Agricultural Production Cooperative. Accountant Min Xianzhang was sitting at the octagonal table, using an abacus and looking at the ledgers, sorting out recent work points and records of grain supplied to the members. Several elderly women were sewing clothes or twisting hemp rope. Children ran in and out of the doorway, constantly busy. This place could be described as conveniently accessible from all directions. Along the corridors on both sides, you could enter several nearby houses, where local hosts and displaced people lived. We also saw two eleven- or twelve-year-old boys (from Wangjia Township) practicing calligraphy in the neighboring room...
    An energetic old woman approached us, holding freshly washed clothes in her hands. We greeted her: "Are you living well? We've come to visit you!"
    "I'm over sixty years old this year. What's there to see at my age?" As soon as she finished speaking, a woman standing in the doorway on the left quickly interjected: "The cadre comrades aren't here to see your fashionable clothes, but to see your production!"
    "I knew it all along. I just like to joke around!" the old woman said with a hearty laugh.
    This witty old woman caught our attention. She led us to another cool room to sit down. Several other old women and young wives followed, bringing their needlework with them. The old woman picked up an unfinished mosquito net and said, "The government is so good to us. I think to myself: I should do as much as I can."
    Everyone called this old woman Yao Erpo. While sewing the mosquito net, she talked about the journey from Wangjia Township to this place:
    "That day, the water rose very quickly, and everyone was very anxious. The government sent steamboats to pick us up. We boarded the boat. I had a bit of diarrhea, and as soon as the boat docked at Xiangyin Wharf, my stomach started to hurt. A young man came over (I later learned he was a worker from the Button Factory in Chengguan Town) and asked me if I felt unwell. He quickly ran to the health clinic and found a doctor to treat me. I took the medicine and calmed down.
    "When we got off the boat, so many people from Shiqiao Township came to welcome us, helping us carry our loads and hold the children. They even carried sedan chairs! People along the way offered us tea. They were so kind! When we arrived here, they immediately set up stoves. I was wondering where to find firewood. Our cooperative had really thought of everything. They had already prepared three days' worth of firewood for each household. It was delivered by boat on the first day..."
    Without us noticing, a young man in his twenties came in and sat next to us. I glanced at him curiously. An old woman seemed to understand what I was thinking and quickly explained, "The strong young men have all gone to the fields to work. His name is Chen Tiansheng. He has some sores on his buttocks and is resting at home."
    The young man said with deep feeling, "Society is so good now. The People's Government cares about us disaster victims, and the farmers in Shiqiao Township treat us like their own brothers. In the puppet government days, who would have cared about your life or death!"
    Mentioning the "puppet government," some painful memories suddenly appeared in the old women's minds. They told us about many tragic past events:
    They had lived in Minxin Dyke and Dingxin Dyke. In 1948, Minxin Dyke collapsed, and over three thousand disaster victims had no food or clothing. Families were separated, and over seven hundred people died of illness or starvation in other villages. In the Xinwei year (1931), there was a major flood, and the disaster victims in Dingxin Dyke ate all the wild grass. Over three hundred people died in other villages.
    Yao Erpo said, "In the Xinwei year, the flood broke the dyke. My old man (husband) carried a carrying pole, with a child on one end and rags on the other, and fled to Changsha. You know how children can't withstand the sun and dew. It wasn't long before he died. Another time the dyke collapsed, and we fled to Changsha again. My old man found odd jobs, and I begged for rice. Comrade, I had just given birth to a child for three days, and I carried the child and begged for rice from door to door! I had a total of nine children, but only one son and one daughter who is married are left. Seven children died of illness or starvation while fleeing from the disaster." As she spoke, she turned her head away and secretly wiped the tears from her eyes with her sleeve.
    This year's flood was even bigger than that year, but in today's liberated era, the situation is completely different. The old women told us with satisfaction that in the very courtyard where they lived, a woman named Liang Meiying gave birth to a chubby baby three days after moving here from Wangjia Township. The landlord gave her a draft-free room, the government sent a midwife to deliver the baby, and the cooperative specially supplied her with an extra ten catties of white rice and lent her 20,000 yuan to buy pig liver and daylily to stimulate lactation. To supplement her nutrition, she also ate three chickens (which she had brought with her when she evacuated)!
    In the same courtyard, there was a cooperative member named Liu Daqiu who was planning to get married on the 26th day of the seventh lunar month. He liked to say to others:
    "Before liberation, when the dyke collapsed, families were separated, and people died. Now it's: unite in production and overcome the disaster. If it weren't for Chairman Mao's good leadership, how could I get married at this time!"
    We took the opportunity to visit Liang Meiying in her room. She was breastfeeding her child, wearing a clean blue jacket and trousers, with full cheeks and a radiant spirit. She looked like she had recovered her health.
    "More Kin Than Our Own Family"
    This is a typical hilly area. Following the undulating terrain, houses are built against the mountains and near the water, forming clusters of "compounds" of a few to dozens of households. Shiqiao Township is made up of dozens of large and small compounds within a radius of a dozen miles, comprising eight villages including Outang, Wuli, and Zaisong. Over the course of a week, we widely visited disaster victims from Wangjia Township who were living in the eight villages. Disaster victims living in Wuli Village said, "Village Chief Yang Baoqing is more kin to us than our own family. When we first came here, Village Chief Yang was busy for three days and three nights, helping us find houses and bed boards. He was still worried late at night and went around to visit us. When he saw someone sleeping outside or in the courtyard, he would wake them up and advise them to sleep inside so they wouldn't catch a cold. When he saw someone sleeping on the ground, he would try his best to find bed boards for them..." People living in Zaisong Village said, "Mutual Aid Team Leader Lao Zhou (Zhou Yongquan) is the most concerned about us disaster victims!" Cadres of the Dongtingwei Agricultural Production Cooperative said, "Party Branch Secretary Hu Jinliang has given us the greatest help!" The reflections varied, but they had one thing in common: they all thought that their own landlord was the best and most concerned about the disaster victims.
    Approaching the Jiang Family Compound, besides feeling a bit crowded, it was really difficult to tell who were the guests (disaster victims) and who were the hosts. Older children led younger children to play, and women gathered together, doing needlework and chatting intimately. Tian Side's family of four had three rooms. At first, he gave up one room for the guests to live in. Later, he felt that the guests were still a bit crowded, so he let his teenage son sleep on the same bed with him and gave up another bed and a mosquito net for Chen Debao's mother, so that the old woman could sleep more comfortably. He saw that the guests hadn't put up their mosquito nets and asked them if they didn't have any. It turned out that the guests all had mosquito nets, but they hadn't brought the poles and didn't want to bother the hosts by looking for bamboo poles everywhere. Tian Side complained that the guests hadn't mentioned it earlier. He quickly found some old net poles from various places and also cut some new bamboo poles of suitable size from the bamboo forest on the hillside. That night, mosquito nets were set up on every bed for the guests.
    There was a farmer named Xu Weisheng in Taohua Village who was usually very clean and tidy. He didn't like children coming to his house to play because he was afraid of getting the house dirty. After the Fujia Mountain Agricultural Production Cooperative relocated here, the office was set up not far from his house. To make it easier for the cooperative's director, Liu Shuqing, to hold meetings and work, he let Liu Shuqing and his wife move into his house with their two children. They lived like a family. Xu Weisheng was a bachelor. After his early rice was harvested, he went to the fields to work, and Liu Shuqing's children helped him dry and watch the grain. Once, he heard Liu Shuqing say that a production team in the cooperative was setting off to produce in the Fifth District but wasn't familiar with the road and wanted to find a guide. He said to Liu Shuqing, "There's no need to find someone else, I'll go!" That day, his tooth was hurting badly. He didn't eat anything, but drank a bowl of thin porridge and led the cooperative's production team off.
    Disaster victims Tao Youbin, Li Desheng, and Nie Guixiang lived in the homes of Xu Maotang and Xu Peitang in Taohua Village. The Xu Maotang brothers not only prepared bed boards but also bought water vats and foot basins for bathing to make their lives easier. They shared any fresh vegetables they had with them, letting the guests have a taste. When it was time to harvest the early rice, Tao Youbin and others offered to help Xu Maotang transplant rice seedlings for a day to thank the hosts for their kindness. Xu Maotang said, "Okay!" So, he weighed out twenty-four catties of rice and bought a pack of cigarettes and sent them to Tao Youbin and others' house. Tao Youbin and the others insisted on not accepting them. They said, "We can't accept wages for helping you transplant rice seedlings!" Xu Maotang said:
    "If you don't accept wages, I can't let you transplant the rice seedlings!" Later, Xu Maotang remembered that the agricultural cooperative was also busy planting sweet potatoes and needed labor. He earnestly said to Tao Youbin and the others, "It's okay if you don't help me transplant the rice seedlings. My several mu of early rice will be fine if our mutual aid team works a little harder."
    Did nothing wrong happen after the Wangjia Township farmers relocated to Shiqiao Township? No, in Zaisong Village, something like this happened: A disaster victim's 110,000 yuan was stolen from his box. This incident aroused the indignation of the local masses. "Which villain is trying to undermine the unity between our two townships? We must find him!" Everyone actively investigated, and the results were quickly discovered. A villain named Zhou Zuoyun, who had once been a bandit and a Kuomintang secret agent, had stolen the money. The disaster victim's money was recovered, the villain was made to make a public self-criticism, and he was sent to the district government for reflection. The exposure of the destructive behavior of individual bad elements made the unity of the people of the two townships even closer.
    Advancing Towards a Common Goal
    The powerful support of Shiqiao Township farmers for Wangjia Township disaster victims was manifested even more in production. They helped the Wangjia Township disaster victims solve one production difficulty after another.
    On the second day after the Wangjia Township disaster victims relocated to Shiqiao Township, cadres and activists from Shiqiao Township enthusiastically led the disaster victims to find wasteland. As long as a piece of wasteland could be used and was most cost-effective, they pointed it out to the disaster victims one by one. In this way, the entire township lent out more than 300 mu of wasteland for the disaster victims to reclaim. However, the tools that the disaster victims brought from the dyke area were not only small in number but also unsuitable for reclaiming wasteland in mountainous areas. Many farmers automatically economized on their tools and supplied all the tools they could spare for the disaster victims to use. With wasteland and enough tools, the formerly barren land was transformed into fertile fields. At this time, the most difficult thing was the lack of seeds. This problem immediately attracted the attention of Shiqiao Township farmers. Various mutual aid teams held meetings to discuss how to help the disaster victims. At that time, the most needed were sweet potato seedlings. So, some were given away, and some were sold, and the problem was quickly solved. The disaster victims originally cultivated dyke fields and were not familiar with the soil properties and farming techniques of the mountainous areas. The sweet potato ridges were uneven, and the holes were either too deep or too shallow. Look! The hosts and "guests" living in each compound had been talking about how to plant sweet potatoes these days. Many earnest people, such as Village Chief Yang Baoqing and old farmer Tian Side, often went to the fields in person to carefully guide the disaster victims, demonstrating and teaching them how to plant sweet potatoes.
    Local farmers didn't neglect to help the disaster victims accumulate fertilizer. The farmers from Wangjia Township in the lakeside area didn't have the habit of burning ash and soil for fertilizer. Many landlords earnestly taught the "guests" how to shovel ash soil and how to light fires to accumulate fertilizer. Some also lent their own manure tanks to the disaster victims.
    Even more valuable was that the Shiqiao Township farmers lent out more than 220 mu of paddy fields for the disaster victims to rush to plant a season of late-maturing crops, which would greatly increase their harvest.
    People who haven't farmed and haven't seen with their own eyes how angry farmers can get if someone accidentally steps on a crop on the edge of a field can hardly truly understand the full meaning of "lending fields" and the profound friendship it embodies.
    Let's take a look at an ordinary farmer, Fu Youxian, a member of the Outang Village Mutual Aid Team.
    In Outang Village, everyone praised him: he fertilized his fields well, grew good rice, and the rice plants he grew were as big as vegetable bowls. He was the most diligent in farming and cherished his fields the most. He never allowed any soil or any small piece of field to be wasted. He had a total of three plots of land (totaling 5.2 mu). But he lent one of the largest and most fertile plots of land, 3 mu, to his disaster-victim brothers. At a mutual aid team discussion meeting to discuss how to help the disaster victims find production opportunities. At first, he silently smoked one cigarette after another, quietly listening to the team members discuss, each lending out one mu, eight fen, or two mu of land according to their own situation. Some people didn't have suitable fields for planting late-maturing crops and wanted to give the disaster victims some sweet potato seedlings to show their concern for their disaster-stricken brothers. Fu Youxian spoke, saying, "I want to lend out that plot of land in front of my house. This plot of land is very fertile, sunny, and convenient for irrigation. If the disaster-victim comrades plant sweet potatoes, they will surely harvest more." This action was warmly praised by the team members.
    We visited Fu Youxian. When talking about lending out his land, he spoke so naturally and earnestly. As if a younger brother had fallen on the road, and the older brother would naturally help him up. He felt that he should lend out his land to help his disaster-victim brothers, so he lent it out. He said, "I was a hired hand for more than ten years and have been farming for more than twenty years. Thanks to Chairman Mao, I turned over, and the land reform gave me three mu of good land. The cadre comrades said that all farmers in the world are one family, and that's very true. If everyone is to have food to eat, I can't eat it if only I have food. Besides, if the disaster-victim comrades produce more grain, the government will provide less relief, and saving grain is also my support for national construction!"
    This is a simple but great idea. This idea was also reflected from another angle. We visited Zhang Juqing, a disaster victim from Wangjia Township and a member of the Dongtingwei Agricultural Production Cooperative, who told us, "This year, there was a flood that hasn't been seen in a hundred years, and the dyke collapsed. The entire Seventeenth District didn't harvest a single rice plant. If it weren't for the leadership of the People's Government, it would have been terrible! From now until the rice seedling transplantation next year, there are still twelve months, and it will take a hundred days to harvest the sweet potatoes. The government provides for the people of the Seventeenth District, using 450 dan of rice every day. The government leads us to transfer to the East Township in an organized manner to carry out production for self-salvation. In the puppet government, let alone a district and a township together, even a family would be separated and scattered in who knows how many places! Everyone has an idea: the flood cannot weaken our confidence in building socialism. We will actively do a good job in production and produce more grain. First, it's for ourselves to get through the disaster, and second, it's to reduce the government's supply, so that the government can use more strength to open factories, which is also our support for national construction!"
    "Supporting national construction" is precisely for this common and great goal that the farmers of Shiqiao Township are using their greatest strength to support the disaster victims of Wangjia Township in carrying out production for self-salvation. The farmers of Wangjia Township, who came from the disaster area, also regard helping Shiqiao Township do a good job in exceeding production targets as their own responsibility. Local farmers didn't have the habit of planting late rice. Wangjia Township started the habit of planting late rice early, with good technology and good tools. Several agricultural production cooperatives in Wangjia Township have selected the best "experts" in planting late rice to guide the local farmers and teach them the techniques of planting late rice. To ensure that the late rice fields are carefully cultivated, they specially brought "Pu Gun" and other agricultural tools from the lake area and helped the local farmers learn how to use them. Rao Fulin, the deputy director of the Dongtingwei Agricultural Production Cooperative, discovered that there were leafhoppers in the local rice fields, so he immediately convened a cooperative affairs committee, assigned special personnel, and took a boat to Wangjia Township to fetch the cooperative's three sprayers and hand them over to the local farmers for use. The 24th was the day before we left Shiqiao Township. The harvest season has begun. The farmers in Shiqiao Township have harvested more than 280 mu of medium rice and immediately planted more than 150 mu of late-maturing crops. With the full support of local farmers, farmers from Wangjia Township also planted 151 mu of sweet potatoes in the reclaimed wasteland and the borrowed paddy fields. On this day, in order to seize the season and race against time, the Dongtingwei Agricultural Production Cooperative from Wangjia Township organized a production shock team, and the work efficiency was increased by 30% compared to usual. Normally, it would take seven workdays to prepare one mu of land (from digging to leveling the soil), but today, forty laborers prepared eight mu of land.
    We followed the comrades of the cooperative affairs work team, Lao Zheng and Lao Hu, to visit the fields. We walked along the path from the edge of Qingshui Pond towards the field. A scene of intense labor and unity unfolded before us: to the left and right, the sound of rice seedling transplantation echoed everywhere in the boiling fields. Far away on the hillside, people's labor gave the verdant hillside a woven pattern of yellow "carpets." On the "carpets," clusters of red, white, and blue flowers were floating in the wind—these were the Wangjia Township women's production team tidying up the wasteland. In the same paddy field, on one side, Shiqiao Township farmers were transplanting rice seedlings, and on the other side, Wangjia Township farmers were digging soil. As we approached a paddy field northeast of the Jiang Family Compound, a farmer in his forties was carrying a load of tea water and walking towards us. He put down the load and warmly invited the Dongtingwei Agricultural Cooperative shock team members who were digging soil to drink tea. The shock team members put down their hoes and happily gathered around the tea bucket. We thought that the cooperative had sent someone to bring tea. After talking to him, we learned that his name was Zheng Xiyao, the owner who lent out this plot of land. He came to the fields today to transplant rice seedlings. Seeing that the shock team members lived far away and it was inconvenient to drink tea, he brought them a load of tea.

    有力的支援，伟大的友谊
    ——记湖南省湘阴县石塘乡农民支援灾区农民安家生产
    本报记者  力文  新湖南报记者  见初
    第一天的见闻
    八月十九日，我们来到了湖南省湘阴县石塘乡。洞庭湖滨的湘滨大垸溃决后，王家乡的农民转移到这乡安置生产，已经一个月零四天了。
    我们向着韩家大屋走去。这是一簇拥有百多间房的“屋场”，王家乡洞庭围农业生产合作社的社员们住在这里。我们走进一座宽大而光亮的堂屋。屋的一边开着六张大铺，每个铺上都有凉席，挂上了蚊帐，虽显得有些拥挤，但是收拾得却也干净利落；另一边，摆着一张大八仙桌，一把圈椅，桌上放着厚厚的一堆账簿，笔、墨，还放着一盏带罩的煤油灯。这就是洞庭围农业生产合作社的临时办公处和住处。会计闵宪章正坐在八仙桌旁，手拨着算盘，眼看着帐簿，整理着近日来的劳动工分，和供应社员粮食的账目。几个年老的妇女在缝补衣服或搓麻线。小孩们从门口跑进跑出忙个不停。这个地方称得起四通八达，沿着两侧的走廊，可走进附近的几座房子，在这些房间里，住着当地的主人，也差不多都住有灾民，还看得见，两个十一二岁的少年（从王家乡来的），在隔壁房子里，正在习字……
    迎面走来一个长得结实的老婆婆，她手里拿着刚洗净的衣服。我们向她问好：“您生活得还好吧，我们来看看您！”
    “我今年六十多岁了，年纪这么大，还有什么好看的。”她刚说完，站在左边门口的一个妇女，连忙插了一句：“干部同志不是来看你的摩登，是来看你的生产哩！”
    “我早晓得，我这个人就爱开开玩笑咯！”老婆婆哈哈地笑了起来。
    这个有风趣的老人，引起了我们的注意。她引我们到另一间凉爽的房子里坐下，几个老婆婆和大嫂子也拿着手里的针线活，跟着走过来了。这个老婆婆又顺手拿起一个还未缝完的蚊帐，她说：“政府对我们这样好，我心里想：自己能做点什么，便尽量多做点事。”
    大家都叫这个老婆婆姚二?毑。她一边缝蚊帐，一边谈起从王家乡转移到此地来，沿途的情景：
    “那一天，水涨得很猛，大家心里蛮着急，政府派轮船接我们来了。我们上了船。我本来有点肚子泻，轮船一靠湘阴码头，肚子疼起来，一个年轻人走过来了（后来才知道他是城关镇纽扣厂的一个工人），问我有什么不舒服，他连忙跑到卫生院，找医生给我看病，我吃了药便安静下来。
    “下了码头，石塘乡派来这样多人迎接我们，帮我们挑担子啦，抱小孩啦，还抬着轿子，沿路有人招呼我们喝茶，够多亲热啊！到了这里，马上安了锅灶，我正想，那里去找烧柴？我们社里想得真周到，已给我们每户社员准备下三天的烧柴，头一天便用船运来了……”
    不知什么时候，进来一个二十多岁的青年人，坐在我们旁边，我注意地看了他一眼。一个老婆婆猜透了我的意思似地，忙解释道：“青壮年都下田生产去了，他叫陈田生，臀上生了几个疮，才躺在家里歇息。”
    这个青年深有所感地说：“如今社会够多好啊，人民政府关心我们灾民，石塘乡农民待我们亲兄弟一样。在伪政府时期，那个还管你死活！”
    提起“伪政府”，一些辛酸的情景，突然出现在老人们的眼前。老婆婆们向我们痛诉了许多悲惨的往事：
    她们曾经住过民新垸和鼎新垸。一九四八年民新垸倒了垸子，三千多灾民，无食无衣，妻离子散，有七百多人病死拖死在外乡。辛未年（一九三一年）发大水，鼎新垸灾民把野草都吃光了，有三百多人死在外乡。
    姚二?毑说：“辛未年发大水，冲倒了垸堤，我的老倌子（丈夫）挑起一根扁担，一头是细人子（小孩），一头是破烂，逃荒到了长沙。你晓得细人子那经得起日晒夜露，没有好久就拖死了。又一次倒垸子，我们又逃荒到长沙，老倌子找零活，我讨米。同志，我生下细人子刚三天，就背起细人子沿门讨米啊！我一共生过九个崽、女，现在身边的只剩下一个崽，一个女儿出嫁了。七个崽女，有的病死，有的是逃荒拖死了。”说到这里，她扭过头去，暗暗用衣袖擦着眼睛里的泪花。
    今年的水，比那年都大，但是，在解放后的今天，情况却完全不同了。老婆婆们满意地告诉我们，就在她们住的这个院子里，有个叫梁梅英的妇女，从王家乡搬到此地后的第三天，生了一个胖胖的娃娃。房东让给她一个不透风的房间，政府派接生员给她接生，社里特地多供应她十斤白米，还借给二万元，让她买猪肝和发奶的黄花，为了补足营养，她还吃了三只鸡（鸡是转移时带出来的）哩！
    在同一个院里，还有个叫刘大秋的社员，正计划着在农历七月二十六日结婚。他爱对别人讲：
  “解放以前，倒了垸子，妻离子散，家破人亡，如今是：团结生产，战胜灾荒。不是毛主席领导的好，我那能在这个时候结婚！”
    我们顺便到梁梅英屋里去看她，她正给孩子喂奶，穿着一身洁净的青色裤褂，两颊丰润，精神饱满，看样子已恢复健康了。
    “比自己屋里的人还亲”
    这里是典型的丘陵地带。顺着起伏的地形，依山傍水，筑成一簇簇几户到几十户人家的“屋场”。石塘乡就是由藕塘、五里、栽松等八个村，方圆十几里以内的大小数十个屋场组成的。我们在一个星期里，曾普遍访问了分住在八个村中的来自王家乡的灾民。住在五里村的灾民说：“村长杨保清对我们比自己屋里的人还亲。我们初来这里，杨村长忙了三天三夜，帮我们找房子，找铺板。半夜了，他还不放心，到处看望，看到谁睡在屋外或天井里，便喊醒他，劝他到屋里去睡，免得着凉。看到有一个人睡在地上，他便想尽办法，给他找到铺板……”住在栽松村的人就说：“互助组组长老周（周咏泉）对我们灾民关心，能数第一！”洞庭围农业生产合作社的干部说：“党支部书记胡金良对我们帮助顶大咯！”反映不一，却有一个共同之点，都自以为自己屋里的房东顶好，对灾民最关心。
    走近蒋家屋场，除了觉得有些拥挤外，实在分不清谁是客人（灾民），谁是主人。年岁大些的孩子，引着小孩子玩耍，妇女们聚在一起，一面做活，一面亲热地谈笑。田四爹一家四口人，共有三个房间，开始，他让出来一间给客人住，后来，感到客人住得还挤一些，他让十几岁的小儿子和自己睡在一个铺上，又让出一张床和一架蚊帐，让灾民陈德保的妈妈睡，使老人睡得更舒适些。他看见客人没有撑起蚊帐，问他们是不是没有？原来，客人都有蚊帐，只是没带来帐杆，又不愿到处找竹杆，打扰了主人。田四爹埋怨客人们，为什么不早提出来，他连忙从各处找到些旧帐杆，又到山坡上竹林里，砍了些大小适宜的新竹杆，当天晚上，客人们的每张床上都撑起了蚊帐。
    桃花村有个名叫徐维生的农民，平素最爱干净，孩子们到他屋里来玩，他都不高兴，怕弄脏了房子。傅家山农业生产合作社转移到此地后，办公室设在离他家不远的地方。为了让农业社社长刘述清开会和工作方便，他却让刘述清夫妇带着两个小孩，搬到他屋里来了。他们像一家人一样的生活着。徐维生是个单身汉，他的早稻收割了，他下田去生产，刘述清的小孩便替他晒谷看谷。有次他听刘述清说：社里的一个生产队出发到五区生产，路不熟，想找个带路人。他对刘述清说：“不用找人了，我去！”那天，他的牙齿正疼得厉害，没有吃饭，他喝了碗稀饭，便领着合作社的生产队出发了。
    灾民陶友宾、李德胜、聂贵湘住在桃花村徐茂堂、徐培堂家里。徐茂堂弟兄不只准备了铺板，还给买了水缸和洗澡的脚盆，使他们生活得方便些。自己屋里吃什么新鲜菜，便分送给他们一些，让客人尝尝鲜。早稻该收割了。陶友宾等提出帮徐茂堂扮一天禾，来答谢主人的盛意。徐茂堂说：“好啊！”于是，他秤了二十四斤米，买了一包香烟送到陶友宾等人的屋里，陶友宾等执意不收。他们说：“要帮你扮禾，工资可不能收！”徐茂堂说：
  “不收工资，不能让你扮禾！”后来，徐茂堂想起农业社也正忙着插红薯，正需要劳动力，他恳切地对陶友宾等说：“不让你帮我扮禾也好，你们社里正忙着插红薯，我的几亩早稻，我们互助组紧张些，也就行了。”
    是不是王家乡农民转移到石塘乡以后，没发生过任何问题呢？不，在栽松村，曾有过这样一件事：有个灾民的十一万元钱，不知被谁从箱子里偷去了。这件事引起当地群众的愤慨，“是那个坏蛋破坏我们两乡人民的团结？一定查出来！”大家都积极调查，很快查出了结果，一个曾经当过土匪和国民党特务的，名叫周作云的坏蛋，把钱偷去了。追回来灾民的钱，让坏蛋当众检讨，并把他送区政府反省。个别坏分子破坏行为的被揭发，两乡人民的团结更紧密了。
    向着一个共同目标前进
    石塘乡农民对王家乡灾民有力的支援，更多的表现在生产方面。帮助王家乡灾民解决了一个又一个的生产中的困难。
    王家乡灾民转移到石塘乡的第二天，石塘乡的干部、积极分子们便热情地带领灾民寻找荒地。只要是那一块荒地能够利用，而且最合算，便一一指点给灾民。这样，全乡共借出三百多亩荒地，让灾民开荒。可是，灾民从垸子里带来的工具，不但数量少，而且不适合山区开荒，许多农民便自动节约工具，把能够让出来的工具都供给灾民使用。荒地有了，工具够用了，曾经是一片片的荒地，变成了良田，这时最感困难的是缺乏种子。这个问题马上引起石塘乡农民的注意，各个互助组开了会，讨论如何帮助灾民，当时最需要的是红薯苗，于是送的送，卖的卖，问题也很快得到解决。灾民本来种垸田，对山区土性，耕作技术不熟悉，红薯垄子搞得不均匀，挖眼不是太深，就是太浅。看吧！住在各个屋场的主人们和“客人”们，这几天谈论的差不多都是怎样插红薯，像村长杨保清、老农田四爹等许多殷勤的人，还时常亲自到地里，细心地给灾民指点，亲自做个样子，教会灾民插红薯。
    当地农民没有忽略了帮助灾民积肥。滨湖区王家乡农民没有烧灰土粪的习惯，不少房东认真教给“客人”如何铲灰土，如何点火等积肥的本领。也有些人把自家的粪缸，借给了灾民。
    更加宝贵的是石塘乡农民借出二百二十多亩水田，让灾民赶种一季晚熟作物，这将会大大增加他们的收获。
    没有种过田的人，没有亲眼看到过，如果有人不小心在田边上踏坏一棵庄稼，会引起农民怎样愤怒的人，是很难真正懂得“借田”的全部意义，和它所蕴蓄着的深厚友谊的。
    让我们看一看一个普通农民、藕塘村互助组员傅友贤吧。
    在藕塘村，人人称赞他：田种得肥，禾做得好，作出来的禾，蔸子有菜碗大一个。他种田最殷勤，也最珍惜田，他从不肯让一点土，一小片田浪费。他一共有三丘田（共计五亩二分）。他却把一丘最大的也是最肥的三亩田借给灾民兄弟了。在一次互助组的讨论会上，讨论如何帮助灾民找生产门路。开始，他沉思地一袋又一袋地抽烟，静听组员们谈论，各人根据自己的情况借出一亩，八分，或二亩田，也有人没有适宜种晚熟作物的田，要送给灾民一些红薯苗，来表示自己对灾区兄弟的关怀。傅友贤发言了，他说：“我想把屋前那丘田借出来。这块田很肥，当阳当晒，上水也方便，灾民同志插上红薯，保证多收一些。”这个行动，引起组员们的热烈称赞。
    我们访问了傅友贤。谈起借田一事，他谈得那样自然而恳切。好像兄弟在路上跌倒了，哥哥自然会把他扶起来一样，他觉得应该借田帮助灾民兄弟，便把田借出来了。他说：“我当了十多年长工，种了二十多年田，搭帮毛主席，我翻了身，土地改革，给我调进三亩好田。干部同志说，天下农民是一家，这话很对，要人人有饭吃，光我一人有饭吃，我吃不下。再说，让灾民同志多生产些粮食，政府少救济些，节省了粮食，也是我傅友贤支持了国家建设啊！”
    这是一个朴实而伟大的思想。这个思想，也曾从另一个角度反映出来。我们访问来自王家乡的灾民，洞庭围农业生产合作社社员张菊青告诉我们：“今年发生百年来没有的大水，倒了垸堤，全十七区没有收一蔸禾。要是没有人民政府领导，真是不得了啊！从现在到明年扮禾还要十二个月，到收红薯也要一百天，政府供应十七区人民，每天要用四百五十担米，政府领导我们有组织转移到东乡，进行生产自救。在伪政府时，不要说一个区一个乡在一起，一家人妻离子散，不知要分多少地方哩！我们人人有个想法：洪水不能减弱我们建设社会主义的信心。我们积极搞好生产，多生产一颗粮食，一来是为了自己度荒，二来也减少政府的供应，让政府用更大力量开办工厂，也就是我们支援了国家的建设！”
    “支援国家建设”，正是为了这一个共同的伟大目标，石塘乡农民用最大力量支援王家乡灾民进行生产自救；来自灾区的王家乡农民，也把帮助石塘乡搞好超额增产当成自己的责任。当地农民没有种晚稻的习惯，王家乡种晚稻的习惯开始得早，技术好，工具好。王家乡的几个农业生产合作社都选派最好的种晚稻的“里手”，指点当地农民，教给他们种晚稻的技术。为了使晚稻田精耕细作，他们特意到湖区取来“蒲滚”等农具，并帮助当地农民学会使用。洞庭围农业生产合作社副社长饶福林发现了当地稻田里有了蜢子虫，便立刻召开社务委员会，抽出专人，划船到王家乡，取来社里的三部喷雾器，交给当地农民使用。二十四日，是我们离开石塘乡的前一天。丰收的季节开始了。石塘乡农民已收割了二百八十多亩中稻，紧接着插上一百五十多亩晚熟作物。王家乡农民在当地农民全力支援下，也在开出的荒地和借出的水田里种上红薯一百五十一亩。这天，为了赶季节，抢火色，王家乡洞庭围农业生产合作社组织了生产突击队，工作效率比平时提高了百分之三十。平时要七个工作好一亩田（从挖土到把土打匀），今天，四十个劳动力作好了八亩田。
    我们随办社工作组的老郑、老胡同志，去田间参观。从清水塘畔向着田塍小道走去。在我们面前呈现出一幅紧张劳动和团结的景象：左面、右面，到处一片扮禾的响声激荡着沸腾的田野，远远山坡上，人们的劳动给翠绿色的山坡，织成一片片的黄色“地毯”，“地毯”上正迎风浮动着一簇簇红的、白的、蓝的花朵——这是王家乡的妇女生产小组在收拾荒地。在同一块稻田里，一面是石塘乡农民扮禾，一面是王家乡农民挖土。当我们走近蒋家屋场东北方的一块稻田的时候，一个四十岁上下的农民正挑着一担茶水，向着这里走来。他放下担子，亲热地招呼正在挖土的洞庭围农业社的突击队员们吃茶。突击队员们放下锄头，高兴地把茶桶围起来。我们想，这大概是社里送茶的人来了，和他攀谈以后，才晓得，这个人叫郑希尧，就是借出这块田的主人，他今天到田里挑禾，看到突击队员们住处离这里远，吃茶不便，顺便给他们挑了担茶来。
