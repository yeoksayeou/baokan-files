In mid-August, after the first session of the First People's Congress of Shanxi Province concluded, I interviewed Wang Shiying, a representative of the National People's Congress and Vice Chairman of the People's Government of Shanxi Province. From our conversation, I learned about the progress of people's democratic political power construction in Shanxi Province over the past five years.

At the beginning of the province's liberation in 1949, there were no immediate conditions for convening a People's Congress through universal suffrage. A transitional form was adopted, using People's Representative Conferences to exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress. By the winter of the same year, People's Representative Conferences at the city and county levels had been generally established throughout the province. In the spring of 1950, the Provincial People's Representative Conference, at its first session, exercised the functions and powers of the Provincial People's Congress and elected the Provincial People's Government. With the widespread convening of People's Representative Conferences at all levels, the people's political enthusiasm was greatly enhanced, and they gradually developed the ability to manage state affairs. Based on this foundation, since 1952, with the exception of a very few counties, People's Representative Conferences in a total of 94 cities and counties throughout the province have successively exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress, electing city and county People's Governments. More than 80 percent of the administrative villages in the province also convened village People's Congresses before the establishment of townships and elected village People's Governments.

With the start of the country's first Five-Year Plan, the work of political power construction in Shanxi Province entered a new stage. From December of last year to April of this year, a historically significant grassroots election was universally carried out throughout the province, and on this basis, the election of representatives to the city, county, and provincial People's Congresses was successfully completed, and People's Congresses at all levels were generally convened.

Over the past five years, the people of Shanxi Province have increasingly deeply recognized their position as masters through their own practice and have exercised the power to manage state affairs through their representatives. The major tasks and major political movements of the People's Government at various periods have been implemented after being discussed and approved or decided upon by the People's Representative Conferences or the People's Congresses. The work plans of the People's Governments at all levels, especially the production plans, have been the central content of each meeting's discussion. This has made the government's plans more in line with the people's demands and objective reality, enabling the plans to be successfully completed. For example, at the first session of the Second People's Representative Conference in Xin County, the government originally planned to build 82 small canals. However, after discussions by the representatives, many methods were devised, and the plan was revised to 209 canals, all of which were completed on time. The resolutions of each People's Representative Conference, especially the resolutions of the People's Congresses after universal suffrage, have been fully realized due to the resolute implementation by the People's Governments at all levels and the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of the people. For example, most of the masses in Wutai County did not have the habit of plowing their land in the autumn in the past. In the autumn of 1952, the County People's Representative Conference made a resolution to mobilize the masses to plow in the autumn. Under the propaganda and leadership of the representatives, the area of land plowed in the autumn in the county reached more than 80 percent.

Over the past five years, the people of Shanxi Province have gradually become accustomed to exercising the power to manage state affairs through the People's Representative Conferences or the People's Congresses. Therefore, before each People's Representative Conference or People's Congress is convened, they actively submit their opinions and demands to the representatives. According to the statistics of one meeting in Anze, Changzhi, and 17 other counties in the second half of 1952 alone, as many as 21,430 proposals were received from the people. All localities have regarded the handling of proposals as a major part of each meeting, generally achieving "every case has a result, every item has an explanation." At a People's Representative Conference held in Zuoquan County in June 1952, the representative of Shili Dian Village in the county proposed that the animal power compensation for plowing cattle in his village was set too high and should be reduced, and that the primary school teacher was incompetent and requested that another teacher be sent. Although these seemed to be two relatively small matters, they were urgent problems that the local people needed to solve. As a result of the review and handling of the proposals, the cattle compensation was revised, and another primary school teacher was sent.

After five years of democratic life, the people of Shanxi Province have understood how to exercise strict supervision and criticism over state organs and state organ personnel through their representatives. In 1952, during the judicial reform and the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, severe criticisms were made of the government's work and the work style of cadres at the People's Representative Conferences of various cities and counties. At the first session of the Second People's Representative Conference in Linfen County, the representatives submitted more than 340 proposals exposing the government's work and the bureaucratic and commandist work style of cadres. The meeting made serious and appropriate handling of the bad people and bad deeds exposed based on the opinions of the masses. In the recent People's Congresses held in various cities and counties, the representatives reviewed the government's work with a serious and responsible attitude and put forward many criticisms and suggestions for improvement. In addition to the relevant cadres making on-the-spot self-criticisms and proposing improvement measures for the shortcomings and problems in the government's work exposed by the representatives, serious problems were discussed by the representatives, and the government immediately dealt with them based on the opinions of the majority of representatives and the masses. For example, at the meeting in Wuzhai County, after the representatives proposed it, the government gave demotions and dismissals to two cadres who had serious mistakes.

Due to the people's serious supervision, the personnel of state organs can more closely contact the masses and conscientiously serve the people. At each meeting, in addition to the heads of the government conducting self-criticisms of the government's work, many cadres can also actively conduct self-criticism. When Jiang County convened the first session of the First People's Congress, the cadres of the government organs wrote letters and visited the representatives during the meeting to solicit more opinions from them and asked the representatives to seriously examine their work. This further inspired the representatives' enthusiasm for being masters of their own affairs, and the representatives' stern and sharp criticisms of the government personnel greatly educated all the cadres.

Over the past five years, although the democratic construction work in Shanxi Province has developed very unevenly and there are still many shortcomings in various aspects, the people have improved and exercised their ability to manage state affairs and fully understand how to be masters of their own affairs. The people have effectively used the People's Representative Conferences or the People's Congresses to handle various necessary matters and solve the problems that need to be solved according to their own will. But the people of Shanxi Province also deeply understand that this power has not come easily. The words of an old farmer in Xiangyuan County express the wishes of the people of the whole province. He said: "Suffered for a lifetime, now we are masters. Without the Communist Party, there would be no such power!" Therefore, the people love their regime even more, trace the origin, and love the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao even more.

    山西省的民主建政工作
    尹书
    八月中旬，当山西省第一届人民代表大会第一次会议闭幕之后，我访问了全国人民代表大会代表、山西省人民政府副主席王世英同志，从他的谈话中，了解到山西省五年来人民民主政权建设工作的情况。
    一九四九年全省解放之初，那时还没有立即召开普选的人民代表大会的条件，曾采取了人民代表会议并由人民代表会议代行人民代表大会职权的过渡形式。同年冬季，全省市、县一级人民代表会议就已普遍建立；一九五○年春，省人民代表会议在第一次会议上即代行了省人民代表大会的职权，选举了省人民政府。随着各级人民代表会议的普遍召开，人民的政治积极性大为提高，并逐步锻炼了管理国家事务的能力。在这个基础上，从一九五二年以来，除极少数县以外，全省共有九十四个市、县的人民代表会议先后代行了人民代表大会职权，选举了市、县人民政府。全省百分之八十以上的行政村，在划乡以前，也都先后召开了村人民代表大会，并选举了村人民政府。
    随着国家第一个五年计划建设的开始，山西省政权建设工作进入了一个新的阶段。从去年十二月开始到今年四月，全省各地普遍进行了具有历史意义的基层选举，并在这一基础上胜利完成了市、县、省人民代表大会代表的选举工作，普遍召开了各级人民代表大会。
    五年来，山西省人民从自己的实践中，愈来愈深刻地认识到自己的主人翁地位，并通过自己的代表行使了管理国家事务的权力。人民政府各个时期的重大工作和各项重大政治运动，都是经过人民代表会议或人民代表大会会议讨论通过或作出决定之后贯彻执行的。各级人民政府各个时期的工作计划，尤其是生产计划，更是作为每次会议讨论的中心内容。这样就使政府的计划更加符合于人民的要求和客观实际，使计划能够胜利完成。如忻县二届一次人民代表会议上，政府原计划兴修小型水渠八十二道，但经过各代表讨论之后，想出了许多办法，把计划修改为二百零九道，结果均按时完成。每次人民代表会议的决议，特别是普选后人民代表大会的决议，由于各级人民政府的坚决贯彻执行和广大人民的热烈支持，都得到完满的实现。如五台县大部分群众过去没有秋耕地的习惯；一九五二年秋季，县人民代表会议作出决议动员群众秋耕，在代表的宣传带动下，全县秋耕地即达到百分之八十以上。
    五年来，山西省人民已经逐渐习惯于通过人民代表会议或人民代表大会行使管理国家事务的权力，因而在每次人民代表会议或人民代表大会会议召开之前，都踊跃地向代表提出自己的意见和要求。仅据一九五二年后半年安泽、长治等十九个县一次会议的统计，收到人民提案即达二万一千四百三十件之多。各地都把处理提案工作当作每次会议的一个主要内容，一般都作到了“案案有着落，件件有交代”。一九五二年六月左权县召开的一次人民代表会议上，该县十里店村的代表提出了他村畜力代耕牛分定得太高，应该降低，和小学教员不称职要求另派教员的提案。这看来虽然是比较小的两件事情，但却是当地人民迫切需要解决的问题，提案审查处理的结果，牛分改订了，小学教员另派了。
    经过五年来民主生活的锻炼，山西省人民已懂得通过自己的代表对国家机关以及国家机关工作人员实行严格的监督和提出批评。一九五二年在进行司法改革和反对官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪的斗争中，各市、县人民代表会议上，都突出地对政府工作和干部作风提出了严厉的批评。临汾县在二届一次各界人民代表会议上，代表们提出有关揭发政府工作和干部作风方面的官僚主义和命令主义的提案即达三百四十余件，会议根据群众意见对所揭发出的坏人坏事分别作了认真适当的处理。各市县在最近召开的人民代表大会会议中，代表们更以严肃认真的态度，审查了政府工作，提出了不少批评和改进意见。对代表揭发出政府工作中的缺点和问题，除由有关干部当场作了检查并提出改进办法外，对性质严重的问题，都经过代表讨论，政府根据多数代表和群众的意见，立即作了处理。如五寨县在此次会议中经过代表提出，对两个有严重错误的干部，政府分别给予了降级和撤职的处分。
    由于人民的认真监督，国家机关工作人员更能密切联系群众、兢兢业业地为人民服务。在每次会议中，除了政府负责人对政府工作进行检查外，不少干部都能主动地进行自我批评。绛县在召开首届人民代表大会第一次会议时，政府机关干部为了使代表能更多地对自己提出意见，在会议期间纷纷给代表写信，并进行访问，要求代表认真检查自己的工作。这就更加启发了代表们当家作主的积极性，而代表们对政府工作人员严正和尖锐的批评，又大大地教育了全体干部。
    五年来，山西省的民主建政工作虽然发展很不平衡，各方面还存在不少缺点，但是人民已经提高和锻炼了管理国家事务的能力，完全懂得了怎样当家作主。人民有效地运用人民代表会议或人民代表大会，按照自己的意志，办理了各种必要办的事情，解决了所要解决的问题。但山西省人民也深深懂得这个权力是来之不易的。襄垣县一个老农的话道出了全省人民的心意。他说：“受苦一辈子，如今当主人，不是共产党，那有这权柄！”因而人民更加热爱自己的政权，追根思源，也就更热爱中国共产党和人民的伟大领袖毛主席。
