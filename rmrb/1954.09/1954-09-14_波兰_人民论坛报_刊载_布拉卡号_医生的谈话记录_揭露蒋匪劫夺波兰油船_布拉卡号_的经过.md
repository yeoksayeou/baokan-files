Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw: The "People's Tribune" published on July 17th an interview record of Edward Swierczak, the doctor on the Polish oil tanker "Praca" that was seized by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique on October 4, 1953. Swierczak returned to Warsaw and spoke to reporters. This record exposes the criminal acts of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, under the direction and support of the United States, in seizing foreign merchant ships and using terror to force crew members to betray their homeland.

Swierczak, a member of the Polish United Workers' Party and the secretary of the Party branch on the "Praca," said that after leaving Singapore, American planes appeared in the sky above the ship three days before it was hijacked. These planes followed our ship for three days and then disappeared, replaced by Chiang Kai-shek's planes. An hour after the last Chiang plane flew away, we spotted a destroyer approaching us, sending light signals demanding that we stop, and threatening to use force if we refused. We then convened a meeting of the Party branch committee to discuss how to deal with this situation: we decided to stall. Radio operator Wietrzyk contacted the Guangzhou radio station, reported our situation and the American plane numbers, and sent out danger signals to nearby ships. A British ship answered our signal, but that was the end of it. Unfortunately, there was little we could do ourselves. Our ship's speed was nine knots, while the enemy ship's speed was more than twenty knots. The ship was carrying oil, and we knew that if the destroyer opened fire, the entire ship would be engulfed in flames. I destroyed the Party documents to prevent them from falling into enemy hands, and waited for events to unfold.

Several motorboats approached us, carrying dozens of Chiang Kai-shek soldiers with American automatic rifles. After boarding, they immediately stormed into the radio room, disabled the equipment, and set up guard posts throughout the ship. After doing this, they ordered our ship to follow the destroyer to Kaohsiung Harbor. Upon arrival in Kaohsiung, we were surrounded by three destroyers.

Swierczak said that the next day, a man came aboard, supposedly a deputy judge named Liu from Chiang Kai-shek's camp. He summoned all the crew members one by one and asked all sorts of political questions. For example, he asked if I was a Communist Party member, whether I believed in God, and also inquired about my military rank. He was also interested in my private life, such as whether I had a wife and children, whether I loved my family, and so on. Their entire interrogation process was aimed at making me and my comrades understand that "Communists in Taiwan would face at least twenty years in prison or be executed." Chiang Kai-shek elements attempted to intimidate us in this way. When this method didn't work, a military police officer told us, seemingly "friendly" and "secretly," that one of our crew members had been shot and that the same fate awaited all of us.

The Chiang Kai-shek gang subjected our crew to extortion and mental persecution. It was obvious that they were trying to make us betray our homeland. During the interrogation, they also showed movies, including various American propaganda films, in an attempt to make us believe in the "paradise" of capitalism.

Swierczak said: One day, they began to deal with us in another way. A group of various "professors" came from Taipei to lecture us. But the officers of the American military police didn't quite believe in the "persuasiveness" of these people, and they stood by the walls with weapons, observing our expressions. These "professors" mostly talked about the inevitability of the Third World War, the power of the atomic bomb and the United States, and so on. Then, they began to advise us that we were now in a desperate situation, that it was impossible to return to Taiwan, and that we would only be able to return to Poland after the Third World War. They said, "Therefore, your only way out is to sign a request for asylum." What was most special was that these "professors" did not allow any discussion. As soon as the lecture was over, each of these "professors" grabbed their briefcases and quickly left. But sometimes we also took the opportunity to rebuke them with the truth in person. Once, one of them was so angry that one of our comrades said: "You treat us like the Gestapo, you are more evil than Hitler!"

Weeks passed like this, and the instigation gradually increased. The Polish crew members protested more and more sharply against this illegal imprisonment, and demanded more and more vehemently to return home. At this time, they used a new set of "persuasion" methods. They began to take us to factories and farms near Kaohsiung to introduce us to the superiority of Chiang Kai-shek and American culture, but the effect was exactly the opposite. Once they took us to a cement factory, and we saw those haggard people having to do all the heaviest work by hand, and their only wage was a small plate of rice and a piece of herring.

Swierczak said that during this period, they first moved our sailors to a hotel in Kaohsiung, and later let us live in the gymnasium of a middle school near the city, and intimidated us, trying to make us submit. They fabricated many false letters and false statements and printed and distributed them. They basely tried to buy off the Poles and threatened us with death. Finally, they allowed us to say that anyone who signed the "request for political asylum" could leave Taiwan and go home. Swierczak said, however, that most of the "Praca" crew members expressed their firm resistance to this. Throughout the period, the Party organization was active, although secretly. At that time, in this most serious test, we could see the qualities of each person, and we could see the strength and courage shown by our crew members. Just like on the front lines, we received three crew members into the Party under the conditions of imprisonment in Taiwan.

Swierczak said that finally, when our protests did not yield any results, we decided to go on a hunger strike. This had some effect, and the Kuomintang elements allowed the Swedish Red Cross to intervene in our fate. We went on hunger strike a total of four times until they assured us that we could indeed go home. Each time they promised us: we could go home at a certain time, but when the appointed date arrived, they continued to detain us, and we went on hunger strike again. This situation continued from April 29th to July 5th. Finally, we were finally released and flew to Bangkok on a Thai plane, and from there we happily returned to our homeland on a Scandinavian Airlines plane.

    波兰“人民论坛报”刊载“布拉卡号”医生的谈话记录
    揭露蒋匪劫夺波兰油船“布拉卡号”的经过
    【新华社华沙讯】“人民论坛报”七月十七日发表了一篇被蒋介石卖国集团在一九五三年十月四日劫夺的波兰油船“布拉卡号”上的医生爱德华·斯沃尔查克返回华沙后对记者的谈话记录，这篇记录暴露了蒋匪在美国的指使和支持下劫夺外国商船，并用恐怖手段强迫船员背叛祖国的罪恶行为。
    斯沃尔查克是波兰统一工人党党员，是“布拉卡号”船上的党的支部书记。他说，离开新加坡后，在船被劫的三天前，轮船上空出现了美国飞机。这些飞机跟随我们的船飞行了三天，最后消失了，代之而来的是蒋介石飞机。在最后一架蒋机飞去后一小时，我们发现有一艘驱逐舰向我们驶近，发出灯光信号要求我们停车，并威胁说，如果拒绝停车就要使用武力。我们于是召集党的支部委员会研究如何应付这种情况：我们决定拖延下去。报务员维却里克与广州的电台接通了，报告了我们的境遇和美机的号码，同时向附近的船只拍发危险信号。有一艘英国船回答了我们的信号，但就此结束了。不幸得很，我们自己所能作的事不多。我们的船的航速是九浬，而敌人的船的航速是二十多浬。船上载运的是石油，我们知道如果驱逐舰开火，全船就将浴在火焰之中。我销毁了党内文件以防落于敌人之手，同时等待事情的演变。
    几艘汽船向我们驶近了，载着几十名带着美国自动步枪的蒋介石水兵。上船后他们立刻闯进了无线电收发室，并使机器不再发生作用，同时在全船各处设了岗哨。这样作了以后，他们就命令我们的船跟随驱逐舰驶往高雄港。到达高雄港后，我们就被三艘驱逐舰包围起来了。
    斯沃尔查克说，第二天，船上来了一个人，据说是蒋匪的副审判长刘某。他逐一地召见了所有的船员，并提出了各式各样的政治性的问题。譬如，他曾问我是不是共产党员、是否信上帝，还询问了我的军衔。对我的私人生活也感兴趣，譬如，我有没有妻子和小孩，是否爱自己的家庭等等。他们整个的审讯过程，是为了要使我和我的同伴理解“共产党员到了台湾至少要坐二十年的监牢或被处死”，蒋介石分子企图用这种方法来威吓我们。当这种办法行不通时，一个宪兵军官像是“友好地”又像是
  “秘密地”向我们说，我们船员中的某人已遭枪毙，并说同样的遭遇也在等待着我们所有的人。
    蒋介石匪帮对我们船员进行讹诈和精神上的迫害。很明显，他们企图使我们背叛祖国。在审讯的同时，他们还放映电影，其中有各式各样的美国宣传片，企图借此使我们相信资本主义的“乐园”。
    斯沃尔查克说：一天，他们开始用另外一种方法来对付我们。从台北来了一批形形色色的“教授”给我们上课。但是美国宪兵队的军官们不太相信这些人的“说服力”，他们提着武器站在墙边，观察我们的表情。这些“教授”讲的大部分是第三次世界大战不可避免，原子弹和美国的强大等。接着，他们开始劝我们说，我们现在处于绝境，从台湾回去是不可能的，我们只有在第三次世界大战后才能回波兰。他们说，“因此，你们唯一的出路就是签名要求庇护。”最特别的是这些“教授”不允许任何讨论，课一讲完，每一个这样的“教授”就夹着皮包赶紧走了。但有时我们也利用机会当面用真理训斥他们几句。有一次把一个家伙可气坏了，我们一个同志说：“你们像盖世太保一样地对待我们，你们比希特勒还可恶！”
    这样过了几星期，同时挑拨也渐增多。波兰船员们愈来愈尖锐地抗议这种非法的监禁，愈来愈激烈地要求回国。这时他们又使用一套新的“说服”方法，他们开始把我们载到高雄附近的工厂和农场去，向我们介绍蒋介石和美国文化的优越性，但是，效果恰恰相反，有一次他们把我们送到一所水泥厂，我们看见那些面色憔悴的人们不得不用手作一切最繁重的工作，而他们唯一的工资是一小碟米和一块鲱鱼。
    斯沃尔查克说，在这段时期中，他们首先把我们的海员们移到高雄旅馆，后来又让我们住在靠近城市的一个中学的体育馆里，并对我们进行恫吓，企图使我们屈服。他们制造了许多假信件和假声明并且把它们印发出去。他们卑鄙地企图收买波兰人，用死来恐吓我们。最后允许我们说，谁若在
  “要求政治庇护”的声明上签字，便可以离开台湾并回家。斯沃尔查克说，但是，大部分的“布拉卡号”船员对此表示坚决的反抗。在整个时期里党组织都在进行活动，虽然在秘密地进行。当时，在这最严重的考验中，我们可以看出每个人的品质，我们能够看出我们船员所表现的坚强和勇敢。正如在前线一样，在台湾的被囚禁的情况下我们接收了三位船员入党。
    斯沃尔查克说，最后，当我们的抗议没有得到任何结果时，我们就决定绝食。这才产生了一些效果，国民党分子允许瑞典红十字会来过问我们的命运。我们一共绝食了四次，直到他们向我们保证，我们确实可以回家时为止。每次他们都答应我们说：到某时可以回家了，但是当指定的日期到来时，他们又继续把我们扣留不放，我们便又绝食。这种情况从四月二十九日一直继续到七月五日。最后，我们终于获得释放并乘泰国的飞机飞抵曼谷，从这里乘斯堪的纳维亚航线飞机幸福地回到了祖国的怀抱。
