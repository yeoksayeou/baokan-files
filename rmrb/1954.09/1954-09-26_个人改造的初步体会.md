    I have devoted myself to operating industrial and commercial enterprises for decades. During the period of reactionary rule, I was often subjected to oppression and exclusion by imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism. For example, the Shanghai Cement Plant, which I operated, had to be shut down for a long time due to the large-scale dumping of surplus American cement after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, and even had to sell coal and other raw materials to maintain operations. At that time, my business methods also learned this set of techniques. As long as it was beneficial to myself, I would use various means to squeeze out others. For example, my match factory squeezed out its competitors by lowering prices and blindly competing for sales, and then bought and merged with them at low prices. Some factories were bought but not put into operation, using reduced production to raise prices. In the old society, I was accustomed to this old capitalist mode of operation, harming others to benefit myself, not feeling ashamed, but rather thinking that I was very capable and made great achievements in industry and commerce. This kind of thinking was gradually criticized and corrected only after liberation, through learning and education by various facts. For example, with the strong support of the government, the Shanghai Cement Plant resumed production shortly after liberation, and production increased rapidly. In the second half of this year, it began to implement joint state-private ownership. Because the match industry carried out planned production according to national needs, blind competition between the Great China Match Company and its competitors was eliminated, and the quality was continuously improved. I realized that if we private industrialists and businessmen want to play a positive role that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, we must obey the management of state administrative organs, the leadership of the state-owned economy, and the supervision of the workers, ensure quality, and produce according to plan; and the old capitalist mode of operation can only play a negative and destructive role in the national economy and the people's livelihood. Therefore, as far as we bourgeois elements are concerned, we must first transform the old idea of "harming others to benefit oneself."
    The purpose of our private industrialists and businessmen in the past to operate and expand enterprises was also incorrect. I once had the idea of passing on my assets to my descendants for generations, and in order to prevent them from competing with each other in business, I did not concentrate on operating one industry, but developed in many directions. Among the enterprises I operated were woolen textiles, matches, cement, coal mines, wharves, etc., for this purpose, to let them live a comfortable bourgeois life forever. In a word, the starting point was entirely for the sake of a private "self." After liberation, through continuous learning and realistic education, I gradually realized that the idea of passing on assets to descendants was completely wrong. I realized the truly bright path to seek happiness for my descendants, which is to make them get rid of this "asset burden" and make them go from seeking their own private interests to serving the interests of the people. Only this path is the guarantee for them to obtain true light and happiness. Now, most of the enterprises I operate have embarked on the advanced form of state capitalism—joint state-private ownership. My future generations will be personally transformed along with the transformation of the enterprises, and gradually transformed into citizens of a socialist society. In socialist society, exploitation and poverty will be eliminated forever, and the people will live a prosperous and happy life. This is what the Communist Party and Chairman Mao planned for the descendants of our 600 million people, a truly correct path to seek happiness for future generations.
    In the past, I did not pay attention to labor. When the business of the enterprise developed and production increased, I always thought that it was because I had managed it well, that the management was effective, and that the machines were good. Moreover, I thought that opening factories and shops was supporting the workers, and I could not see the strength of the workers and could not see that I had exploited the fruits of the workers' labor. After liberation, with the improvement of the workers' awareness, they not only showed self-sacrificing spirit in the difficult stages of the enterprise, overcoming the temporary difficulties of the enterprise, but also because the workers displayed a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, a new atmosphere appeared in the production of each enterprise. Taking the Shanghai Cement Plant as an example, the machines have been used for more than 30 years, and they were severely damaged by the Japanese invaders during the Anti-Japanese War, and the production volume was greatly limited. However, since the resumption of production after liberation, especially since the acceptance of state orders in 1951, production has increased year by year. Without adding equipment, the output has exceeded the highest record before the war by 30%. Starting in the second half of this year, joint state-private ownership has been implemented. Due to the change in the nature of the enterprise, the workers have further exerted their enthusiasm, ensuring the long-term safe operation of the large kiln for more than 300 days. In addition, various production departments have also put forward specific guarantees for improving quotas and saving raw materials. Before liberation, no one could believe that the output of old machines that had been used for more than 30 years would exceed that of new machines. Whose power is this? Is it the capitalists who have the method? Is it the machines that have the method? All of them are not, but the working class has exerted incomparable power. The iron-like facts cannot but make me convinced. It can be seen that the achievements of the enterprise over the years have all relied on the strength of the workers. It is not I who supported the workers, but the workers who supported me.
    The above are all the changes in my thinking and the improvement of my understanding through learning and realistic education in recent years, that is, the gradual transformation of myself. Now, most of the enterprises I operate have embarked on the advanced form of state capitalism. Some people ask me: "You have spent your whole life painstakingly creating enterprises, and one by one they have embarked on joint state-private ownership. Do you feel a little reluctant?" Indeed, when the two woolen textile factories I worked hard to operate during the Anti-Japanese War—Chongqing China Woolen Textile Factory and Lanzhou Northwest Woolen Textile Factory—first implemented joint state-private ownership, I was still a little vague in my thinking, thinking that it was "the general trend, and there was no other choice." Now, I have studied the general task of the state in the transition period, participated in the discussion of the draft constitution, and personally witnessed the development of production after joint state-private ownership; in the past, I thought it was "the general trend," but now I think it is "necessary to change." Moreover, the existence and development of these enterprises in the past would never have been possible without the active labor and the spirit of overcoming difficulties of the workers. These are all the fruits created by the workers' labor, and what I feel now is that my contribution to the country is too little. Now, actively promoting enterprises to embark on the road of state capitalism as soon as possible has become my current sincere wish. At the establishment meeting of the Shanghai Cement Plant and the Zhanghua Wool and Linen Textile Factory after the approval of joint state-private ownership, the government leaders also offered encouragement to me for some of the efforts I had made for the enterprise in the past, which made me feel even more ashamed. At the same time, it further educated and encouraged me, making me more clearly aware that as long as we private industrialists and businessmen recognize our position and direction, contribute all possible strength on the basis of patriotism and law-abiding, and accept socialist transformation, then the future is very bright.
    At present, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, which is entrenched in Taiwan, is colluding with American imperialism, attempting to undermine our construction, hinder our trade, and endanger the peaceful life of the people. The democratic parties and people's organizations across the country have issued a joint declaration for the liberation of Taiwan. This is the most important and sacred task for the people of the country at present. Only by liberating Taiwan and eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang can our construction and peace cause be guaranteed. Therefore, I am determined to work together with private industrialists and businessmen across the country, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, to make every effort to support this struggle and contribute all possible strength to support the country in completing the sacred task of liberating Taiwan.

    个人改造的初步体会
    全国人民代表大会代表 公私合营章华毛麻纺织公司董事长
      大中华火柴公司董事长  刘鸿生
    我几十年来都致力于经营工商业。在反动统治时期，经常受着帝国主义和官僚资本的压迫和排挤，如我经营的上海水泥厂，抗战胜利后由于美国剩余水泥的大量倾销，曾不得不长期停工，甚至以出卖煤块等原料来维持。在当时，我的经营方式也是学的这一套手法，只要对自己有利，就不惜用各种手段来排挤别人。例如我经营的火柴厂，以压低价格，盲目竞销的方式挤垮了同业，然后再以廉价收买、兼并同业工厂，有些厂买下后并不开工，用减少生产来抬高价格。在旧社会里，我习惯于这一套旧的资本主义经营方式，损人利己，不以为耻，反而自认为长袖善舞，在工商业中大有作为。这种思想，直到解放以后，通过了学习，通过了各种事实的教育，才逐渐得到了批判和纠正。例如上海水泥厂在政府的大力扶助下，解放后不久就复工，生产直线上升，今年下半年开始实行了公私合营；火柴业由于按照国家需要，进行计划生产，大中华火柴公司和同业之间就消除了盲目竞争，质量也不断提高。我认识到我们私营工商业者要发挥对国计民生有利的积极作用，必须服从国家行政机关的管理、国营经济的领导和工人群众的监督，保证质量，按照计划生产；而旧的资本主义经营方式，只能对国计民生起消极的破坏作用。因此，就我们资产阶级分子来讲，首先必须改造“损人利己”的旧思想。
    我们私营工商业者过去经营和扩充企业的目的也是不正确的。我曾经有过子孙万代的打算，要把我的资产一代代地传给子孙，而且为了防止他们在业务上相互竞争，所以并不集中经营一业，而向多方面发展，我经营的企业中有毛纺、火柴、水泥、煤矿、码头等等，就是为了这个目的，要让他们永远过着资产阶级的舒服生活。一句话，出发点完全为了一个私字。解放以后，经过了不断的学习，和现实的教育，我才逐渐认识到把资产传给子孙的想法是完全错误的。我认识了为子孙谋幸福的真正光明的道路，就是要使他们摆脱这个“资产包袱”，使他们从谋一己的私利走到为人民利益而服务的道路。只有这条道路才是他们获得真正光明和幸福的保证。现在我所经营的企业，多数已经走上了国家资本主义的高级形式——公私合营，我的后一代将随着企业的改造而得到他们个人的改造，逐步改造成为社会主义社会的公民。到了社会主义社会，永远消灭了剥削和贫困，人民都将过着繁荣幸福的生活，这是共产党和毛主席为我们六亿人民的子孙万代打算，真正为子孙万代谋幸福的正确的道路。
    从前我对劳动是不重视的，企业的业务发展了，生产提高了，总认为是自己经营得法，管理有方、机器好。而且认为开厂设店，就是养活了工人，根本看不到工人群众的力量，看不到自己剥削了工人的劳动成果。解放后随着工人觉悟的提高，不仅在企业的困难阶段发挥了自我牺牲精神，克服了企业暂时的困难，而且由于工人发扬了高度的积极性和创造性，每一个企业的生产都出现了新气象。以上海水泥厂来说，机器已经使用了三十多年，在抗战时期又受过日寇的严重破坏，生产量受到很大的限制。可是自解放复工以后，特别自从一九五一年起接受了国家订货任务以后，生产历年提高，在不增添设备的情况下，产量竟超过了战前最高纪录的百分之三十。今年下半年度起实行公私合营，由于企业性质的转变，工人更进一步的发挥了积极性，保证完成了大窑长期安全运转三百天以上，此外各个生产部门也都提出了提高定额，节约原料的具体保证。解放以前谁也不能相信，用过了三十多年的旧机器，生产量竟会超过新机器，这是谁的力量，是资方有办法么？是机器有办法么？全都不是，而是工人阶级发挥了无比的力量，铁一般的事实不能不使我心悦诚服了。由此可见，企业历来的成就，都是依靠了工人群众的力量，不是我养活了工人，而是工人养活了我。
    以上所述，都是几年来通过学习和现实的教育，使我的思想有了改变，认识有了提高，也就是个人逐步得到了改造。现在，我所经营的企业多数已经走上了国家资本主义的高级形式，有人问我：“你一生费尽心血创办的企业，一个个走上公私合营，心里是否有些舍不得？”诚然，当我在抗战时期辛苦经营的两个毛纺织厂——重庆中国毛纺厂和兰州西北毛纺厂最先实行公私合营的时候，我思想上还是有些模糊的，以为“大势所趋，不得不然”。现在我学习了国家过渡时期总任务，又参加了宪法草案的讨论，又亲眼看到了公私合营后的生产发展情况；过去认为“大势所趋”，现在认为“非改不可”。何况这些企业过去的存在和发展，如果没有工人群众的积极劳动和克服困难的精神，也绝对不会有今天，这都是工人们劳动创造的果实，我现在所感觉到的倒是我对国家贡献太少了。现在，积极推动企业早日走上国家资本主义的道路，已成为我目前衷心的愿望。在上海水泥厂和章华毛麻纺织厂批准公私合营以后的成立大会上，政府首长对我过去为企业所尽的一些努力，也提出了勉励，使我更感到惭愧，同时也进一步教育和鼓励了我，使我更清楚地认识到我们私营工商业者只要认清自己的地位和方向，在爱国守法的基础上贡献出一切可能的力量，接受社会主义改造，那么前途是非常光明的。
    目前，窃据台湾的蒋匪帮，正在勾结美帝国主义，妄想破坏我们的建设，阻碍我们的贸易，危害人民的和平生活，全国各民主党派、各人民团体已经发出了为解放台湾联合宣言，这是全国人民当前最重大的神圣任务，只有解放了台湾，消灭了蒋匪帮，我们的建设与和平事业才有保障。因此，我决心和全国私营工商业者一道，在共产党和毛主席英明领导之下共同努力以全力来支援这一斗争，贡献出一切可能的力量，来支援国家完成解放台湾的神圣任务。
