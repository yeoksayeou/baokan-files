Six Hundred Million People's Hearts Blossom
By our reporter Yuan Shuipai

    The representatives walked into the meeting hall, taking their seats in the highest organ of state power.

    They came from the edges of lathes, from the fields, from the mines, from coastal guard posts. They put down their wrenches, put down their plows, put down their picks, put down their pens and compasses... Together with the leaders of the Party and government whom they love, they discussed the major affairs of the country.

    Among them were many people who had made outstanding contributions to the cause of the people's revolution, and many were representatives of various democratic parties and democratic strata, expressing the common will of the six hundred million people.

    Here were white-haired elders who had personally experienced the political storms of modern China, and here were advanced young people who had grown up in the new era and had just reached voting age.

    They came from every province of China, from the green seashores, from the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, from the Tibetan Plateau more than 5,000 meters above sea level, from the oases under the Kunlun Mountains' snow peaks, and from the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau on the southwestern border. They were representatives of the Kazakh, Uyghur, Yi, Miao, Zhuang...ethnic groups. They wore bright festive costumes.

    Flying across the waves of the Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean...they came to the motherland. They were compatriots from Nanyang, Europe, Africa...

    The people gave all these representatives supreme glory and entrusted them with the most important responsibilities. Their faces showed expressions of excitement and seriousness.

    This meeting hall was once the venue of the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and now it has been built even more grandly and magnificently. It reminds people of our motherland, and the face of the motherland has also undergone tremendous changes in the past five years. At that time, our Southwest and Northwest had not yet been liberated. Now we are about to complete the second year of the Five-Year Construction Plan. Our deserved place in international affairs has been affirmed by more and more people in the world. The unity of the people has been strengthened, and the people's democratic system has been further developed and consolidated.

    At exactly 3:00 p.m., the first session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China began.

    In front of Tiananmen Square, the glorious national flag was raised in the clear sky of Beijing.

    Chairman Mao, the most beloved leader of the Chinese people, delivered the opening speech to the conference. In a firm and powerful voice, he announced the general task of the Chinese people, and every word he said shone with the light of truth, deeply striking every person's heart. They applauded every one of his sentences.

    Throughout the country, people were listening in front of radios.

    They also listened to Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft constitution.

    Yes, the representatives were about to formulate a constitution in this meeting hall that had been dreamed of by countless patriots for more than a century and longed for by six hundred million people.

    They represent all the people, coming here to exercise the highest power of the state. But the ancestors of many of them once swallowed their tears while living their lives. Many of them themselves had suffered all kinds of hardships until the day of liberation.

    Sitting here are outstanding agricultural labor models. In the past, they did not even dare to pass by the landlord's courtyard, and had to take a detour. They never dared to cross the threshold of any yamen, unless they were bound hand and foot, but now they have entered the highest organ of state power as masters.

    Today, sitting on the rostrum is a farmer, Li Shunda, a representative from Shanxi Province. He had never left his hometown mountain valley before, and only went to the county after liberation. He said: "In the past, how could we ever manage national affairs!" But after liberation, he went to Beijing, to the Soviet Union, and now he has been elected as a National People's Congress representative. "In the past, I couldn't even dream of it!"

    The fifty-seven agricultural labor models elected as representatives all have a similar painful history to that of Lü Hongbin, a representative from Shandong Province. Before liberation, Lü Hongbin's family, because they had nothing to eat, went to the Northeast, and when they returned, only two of the nine family members were left. After liberation, he became the director of an agricultural production cooperative. He said, "This time, the village selected the township, the township selected the county, the county selected the province, and the province selected the central government," and he really didn't know how to be happy enough. He stroked the certificate of election as a National People's Congress representative that he received after arriving in Beijing. His hands, which had been a carpenter and tenant farmer since childhood, were covered with thick calluses. Perhaps because of the calluses, it was not easy to feel; perhaps to protect the gold-plated cover of the certificate, he used the back of his fingers instead of his palms to gently stroke the certificate back and forth.

    The stories of the ninety-eight industrial labor models also have many things in common. Liu Lifu, a representative from Dalian, painfully recounted that he was an apprentice hawker since he was a child, sold tofu, and carried soybean cakes on the dock at the age of fourteen, "Being beaten with whips and clubs was commonplace. But now, we, who were looked down upon, have become the masters of factories and the masters of the country!"

    Some time ago, Zhang Zifu, a representative from Fushun City, also angrily talked about the facts of being oppressed and humiliated by coal mine bosses before liberation. One boss stipulated that they should take turns shaving off half of their hair every half a month. Later, another boss replaced him, but stipulated that everyone had to shave off their eyebrows. All of this was done so that they could be easily identified and could not escape. He said, "My father herded sheep, my uncle herded cattle, and I herded pigs, but now I have received such great glory."

    The one hundred and forty-seven women representatives were even more excited. Shen Jilan, a deputy director of an agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperative in Shanxi, used to be like the vast majority of Chinese women, only staying at the stove, "Not going out of the gate, not going out of the second gate." After liberation, she turned herself over and even attended the World Women's Congress.

    On the night when Yi Shijuan, a textile worker from Shanghai, received the news of her election, she happened to be on the night shift, and at first she didn't even know. As soon as she walked into the workshop, many people came to shake her hand and congratulate her. An elderly female worker said to her, "Although you have also suffered, you still don't know how deep the suffering of us old people is. Going to Beijing is good! You represent all of our female workers to vote!"

    How many working people, how many women, do not even have a formal name or so-called "school name," and still use the nicknames their parents called them when they were young, such as "Agou," "Liuhai," "Amei," "Xiaomei"... But it is these people who have been elected as representatives to the National People's Congress today.

    Among the representatives, thirty-four are young people under the age of twenty-five. Hao Jianxiu, who is famous throughout the country, is one of the young people who has just reached voting age. Gu Faming, a coal mine worker from Liaoning Province, is twenty-four years old this year, and he is particularly grateful for the country's love for young people.

    The words of Jin Baishan, chairman of the Xinghuo Collective Farm in Heilongjiang Province, a Korean ethnic, made people believe that he also expressed the feelings of other ethnic minorities. He said that only in the new society can ethnic minorities enjoy equal rights. He recalled that in the past, Japanese imperialists did not allow them to speak Korean. Now their children can go to their own schools and read Korean textbooks.

    The attendance of the overseas Chinese representatives, representing more than 12 million overseas Chinese, fully demonstrates the motherland's deep concern for its overseas children. They have been discriminated against and bullied for a long time, and now they can also straighten their backs and walk with their heads held high. Li Guangchen, a representative who was one of the 120,000 Chinese laborers who went abroad during World War I, was only in his twenties when he went to France, and now he is an elderly man in his sixties with white hair when he returned to China. He said with boundless excitement that the motherland he saw had completely changed, and the people had also changed. He could hardly understand what the young people were saying, and they had received a new education.

    The older representatives are happy that they can personally witness the country's transformation from weak to strong. Sitting here are Qi Baishi, a ninety-three-year-old painter, Situ Meitang, an eighty-seven-year-old leader of overseas Chinese... They cannot help but have many feelings. Some time ago, in her home, He Xiangning, a seventy-seven-year-old overseas Chinese representative, took out the Provisional Constitution created by Sun Yat-sen in the first year of the Republic of China, pointing out that it contained the democratic rights that the people should have. She said in a trembling voice: "But where have the Chinese people obtained these rights for decades? From Yuan Shikai to Chiang Kai-shek, they have done everything they could to deprive and destroy the people's rights."

    Zhang Zhizhong, a representative from Gansu Province, told reporters his feelings: Chiang Kai-shek had no people in his mind at all. "Military rule, tutelage, constitutionalism" was actually "military rule" to the end, fighting the civil war to the end. In the last few years of reactionary rule, in order to deceive the people, they engaged in the National Assembly and elections, but wasn't it just his dictatorship? But under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the convocation of our conference this time is a further consolidation and development of the people's democratic system in the new China.

    Cai Tingkai, a representative from Guangdong Province, remembered many of the ugly things that Chiang Kai-shek did in the pseudo-“National Assembly” representative elections. Package deals, bribery, bribery, you snatch and I grab... Those who did not get their hands on them carried a coffin into the pseudo-“National Assembly” venue to vent their anger! He said that now there is true democracy, and the people have various rights. This is the first time in the history of China.

    Zhang Zifu, the representative, remembers when the Kuomintang held pseudo-“National Assembly” elections in their mining area. The bosses collected the miners' seals one by one and put them in a big pocket. The people who were elected were the secret agents who beat and scolded the workers. He said angrily: "They used our own fists to hit our own eyes!"

    One thousand two hundred and twenty-six representatives, representing the will of the entire Chinese people to be masters of their own affairs, came to exercise the highest power of the state.

    While the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek were still riding on the backs of the Chinese people (1940), our beloved leader issued a radiant scientific prophecy, saying: "The mast of the new China's ship has already emerged from the horizon... The new China is ours."

    Nine years later, this ship appeared in its entirety on the eastern sea in a glow of light. The new China was established.

    Fourteen years later today, this ship, steered by the people, is sailing towards an even more glorious course.

    That rudder is the constitution that all the representatives are about to formulate. When discussing the draft constitution, Li Chuanjiang, a oil pressing worker representative from Liaoning Province, said that the constitution is our work guideline.

    Many representatives said at the discussion meetings of the representative groups that the constitution is a guarantee of happiness. One farmer representative said that it is a treasure that the Communist Party has found for the people. With it, we can guarantee the transition to a happy socialist society.

    Ma Liuhai, a representative from Shanxi Province, felt that every article of the constitution was related to his vital interests. He delivered meals to his father at the coal kiln when he was seven or eight years old, and carried coal himself when he was a little over ten years old. Before liberation, his child was only nine years old and also went down to the coal kiln. One brother was crushed to death by coal, and one brother was sick and had no money to see a doctor, and died at the age of sixteen. Four younger sisters were drowned at birth. But now his family lives in a new house and lives a happy life. Five of the eight family members are in school. He already has two sons and three daughters. In the past few years, he has gone to sanatoriums several times for vacations. "In the past, how could we talk about workers having the right to rest? Even without rest, we still had to worry about going hungry." He used to work seven shifts in a row, working underground for fifty-four consecutive hours. If he lost his job, he would wander everywhere and beg for food.

    Many representatives said the same thing as military representative Wang Weifu, Fushun City representative Wang Chonglun, and Liaoning Province representative Wei Yuxi. Wei Yuxi said that the Kuomintang's law was a law for the common people to be beaten. Wang Weifu said that the laws of the past were tools of exploitation.

    Wang Chonglun, who is sitting on the rostrum today, once said that the new China's constitution is a constitution that has emerged from the masses of the people after open discussion. "The veteran revolutionaries have fought down the country for us and fought for various democratic rights. We must use the constitution to fix every item and keep them well. We must use practical actions to carry out the technical innovation movement to guarantee the implementation of the constitution." To take the lead in abiding by the constitution is their common vow.

    The representatives are also excited about another great happy event that the conference is about to hold. Many representatives said in unison that when the masses cheered them on to Beijing, they all told them to elect the most beloved person to be the leader of their country.

    Wang Yougen, a military representative, was studying at school when he received the news of his election. Many students and teachers came to congratulate him, forming a symposium. They enthusiastically said that it would be best if he could sign their names when he voted. When Qu Yaoli, a representative from Shanxi Province, came to Beijing, the people at the tractor station also came to see him off, saying that he must cast a vote for them. Another representative from Shanxi Province, Wu Chunan, said that when he set off, an old member of the community, over seventy years old, ran over to greet him, and he thought he wanted to bring something. But what the old man said was the one sentence that everyone had in their hearts. Patikhan Sugurbayev, a representative from Xinjiang Province, also told reporters with a smile that when he passed through the Altay grassland, a Kazakh herdsman who was poor in the past and now has more than a dozen livestock held his hand and could not speak, and finally only said one sentence: "Be sure to elect him!"

    From Mount Everest to the Yalu River, from the Tarim Basin to the Pearl River Delta, six hundred million people have the same wish. This is a great day of joy for China! Flowers have blossomed in the hearts of six hundred million people!

    六亿人民心花开
    本报记者　袁水拍
    代表们走进了会场，坐上最高国家权力机关的席位。
    他们从车床边来，从田地里来，从矿井来，从海岸的防哨来。放下钳子，放下犁把，放下镐头，放下笔杆、圆规……同他们所爱戴的党和政府的领导人们一起、商量着国家的大事。
    他们当中有很多是对人民革命事业有杰出贡献的人，有很多是各个民主党派、各个民主阶层的代表者，他们是六亿人民的共同意志的表达者。
    这里有亲历近代中国政治风涛的白发老人，这里有在新时代成长起来、刚到选举年龄的先进青年。
    他们来自中国的每一个省份，来自绿色的海滨，来自内蒙古的草原，来自拔海五千公尺以上的西藏高原，来自昆仑山雪峰下的绿洲，来自西南边陲的云贵高原。他们是哈萨克、维吾尔、彝、苗、僮……族的代表。他们穿着鲜艳的节日的盛装。
    飞越了太平洋、印度洋……的浪涛，他们来到祖国。他们是侨居南洋、欧洲、非洲……的祖国同胞。
    人民给了所有这些代表们以无上光荣，也付托给他们最重大的责任。他们脸上流露着兴奋和严肃的表情。
    这会场曾经是人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议的会场，现在建筑得更加宏伟壮丽了。它使人联想到我们祖国，祖国的面貌五年来也有了巨大的改变。当时，我们的西南、西北还没有解放。现在我们已经快走完五年建设计划的第二个年头。我们在国际事务中的应得的地位，已经被世界上越来越多的人所肯定了。人民的团结加强了，人民民主制度也进一步地发展和巩固。
    下午三时正，中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议开始了。
    天安门前，北京的晴空里升起了光荣的国旗。
    中国人民的最亲爱的领袖毛主席向大会致开幕词。他以坚定有力的声音宣告中国人民的总任务，他说的每一个字闪耀着真理的光辉，深深地打进每一个人的心坎。他们为他的每一句话鼓掌。
    在全国各地，人们在收音机前倾听着。
    也倾听着刘少奇代表关于宪法草案的报告。
    是的，代表们就要在这会场上制定为一百多年来无数志士仁人所梦想、为六亿人民所渴望的宪法。
    他们代表着全体人民，来到这里行使国家的最高权力。可是他们很多人的祖祖辈辈，曾经吞咽着眼泪过日子。很多人自己也曾经受尽苦难，直到解放的一天。
  坐在这里的有杰出的农业劳动模范。从前他们连地主的院子也不敢经过，要绕着路走。他们从来也跨不进任何一个衙门的门槛，除非是被捆绑着双手，可是现在他们以主人翁的身份走进了最高国家权力机关。
    今天坐在主席台上的就有一个农民，他是山西省代表李顺达。他从前没有出过家乡的山沟，解放后才到了县里。他说：“过去国家大事哪捞得上管！”可是解放后他上北京，到苏联，现在更当选为全国人民代表。“过去，连梦也梦不到啊！”
    五十七位当选为代表的农业劳动模范都有着类似山东省代表吕鸿宾的悲痛历史。解放前吕鸿宾一家因为没有吃的，投奔关外，回来的时候一家九口只剩下两口。解放后他当了农业生产合作社社长。他说：“这次庄里选到乡，乡里选到县，县里选到省，省里选到中央”，真是不知道该怎样高兴。他抚摸着到北京后领到的全国人民代表当选证书。他那双从小当木匠、佃农的手结着厚厚的茧。也许为了有茧，不容易感觉；也许为了爱护证书的烫金皮面，他不用手心却用手指背轻轻地来回抚摸着那本证书。
    九十八位工业劳动模范的故事也有着不少共同点。旅大市代表刘立富沉痛地诉说，他从小就当小贩学徒，卖过豆腐，十四岁就在码头上背豆饼，“挨皮鞭，挨木棒是家常便饭。可是现在，我们这些被瞧不起的人当了工厂的主人、国家的主人了！”
    前些时，抚顺市代表张子富也愤怒地谈到解放前受煤矿把头压迫侮辱的事实。有一个把头规定他们每半个月轮番剃去半边头发。后来换了另一个把头，却规定他们每人都要剃去眉毛。都是为了容易辨认，不好逃掉。他说：“我父亲放羊，大爷放牛，自己放过猪，现在却得到了这样大的光荣。”
    一百四十七位妇女代表更加兴奋。申纪兰这个山西的一个农林畜牧生产合作社副社长，从前像中国绝大多数妇女那样只是守着锅台，“大门不出，二门不迈”，解放后翻了身，还出席过世界妇女大会。
    上海市代表纺织女工裔式娟得到自己当选消息的那天晚上，刚好她上夜班，起先自己还不知道。走进车间，就有不少人来拉她的手，向她道喜。一个老年女工对她说：“你们虽则也受过苦，可是你们还不知道我们老年人受的苦有多深。到北京去，好啊！你代表我们全体女工投票吧！”
    多少劳动人民，多少妇女，甚至连一个正式名字或者所谓“学名”也没有，到老还是用着爹娘在他们小时候呼唤的“阿狗”“六孩”“阿妹”“小妹”……这些奶名。可是，就是这样的人，今天被选为全国人民代表大会的代表。
    代表当中有三十四位是二十五岁以下的青年。全国闻名的郝建秀就是刚到选举年龄的青年之一。辽宁省代表煤矿工人谷发明今年二十四岁，他特别感激国家对青年的爱护。
    黑龙江省代表星火集体农庄主席朝鲜族金白山的话，使人相信同样也表达了其他少数民族的心情。他说，只有在新社会少数民族才能享受到平等权利。他回想起过去日本帝国主义者不让他们说朝鲜话。现在他们的孩子却能进自己的学校，读朝鲜语文的课本。
    代表着海外一千二百多万华侨的华侨代表们的出席，充分表现了祖国对它的海外子女的深切关怀。他们长久以来受歧视受欺侮，现在他们也能够挺直身子抬着头走路了。第一次世界大战时出国的十二万华工之一的李广臣代表，到法国的时候才二十来岁，现在回国已是六十开外的白发老人。他无限兴奋地说，他看到的祖国已经完全变了样，人也变了样，青年们说的话他几乎听不懂了，他们受到了新的教育。
    年老的代表们为他们能够亲见国家的转弱为强而快乐。这里坐着九十三岁的画家齐白石，八十七岁的华侨领袖司徒美堂……他们不能不有许多感慨。前些时，在她家里，七十七岁的华侨代表何香凝取出民国元年孙中山先生领导缔造的临时约法，指点上面载有人民应得的民主权利。她颤声说：“可是几十年来中国人民哪里得到过？从袁世凯到蒋介石，他们做尽了剥夺破坏人民权利的一切罪行。”
    甘肃省代表张治中告诉记者他的感想：蒋介石心目中根本没有人民。“军政、训政、宪政”，实际上是“军政”到底，打内战到底。反动统治的最后几年，为了欺骗人民，搞什么国民大会和选举，还不是他一个人独裁？但在中国共产党领导下，我们这次大会的召开，却是新中国人民民主制度的更进一步的巩固和发展。
    广东省代表蔡廷锴记起了蒋介石搞伪“国大代表”选举的许多丑事。包办、收买、贿赂、你抢我夺……得不到手的人为了泄愤，把一口棺材抬进了伪“国大”会场！他说，现在是真正的民主，人民有了各项权利，这是中国开天辟地以来第一次。
    张子富代表记得当年国民党在他们矿区搞伪“国大”选举。把头把矿工们的图章一个个收去，装了一大口袋。选出来的人就是打骂工人的特务。他愤愤地说：“他们拿我们自己的拳头打我们自己的眼！”
    一千二百二十六位代表，代表全中国人民当家作主的意志，来行使国家的最高权力。
    还在日本侵略者和蒋介石骑在中国人民身上的时候（一九四○年），我们敬爱的领袖发出了光芒万丈的科学的预言，他说：“新中国航船的桅顶已经冒出地平线了……新中国是我们的。”
    九年后，这条航船全身显现在一片霞光的东方大海上。新中国成立了。
    十四年后的今天，这条航船，由人民掌着舵，向着更加光辉灿烂的航程前进。
    那舵就是全体代表们将要制订的宪法。在讨论宪法草案的时候，辽宁省代表榨油工人李川江说，宪法是我们的工作指针。
    好些代表们在代表组的讨论会上说，宪法是幸福的保证书。有一个农民代表说，它是共产党给人民找到的宝贝。有了它，可以保证过渡到幸福的社会主义社会。
    山西省代表马六孩感到宪法的每一条都和他的切身利益有关系。他七、八岁就给煤窑上的父亲送饭，自己十来岁就背煤。解放前，他的孩子才九岁，也下了煤窑。一个哥哥给煤砸死，一个哥哥病了没钱医，十六岁就死了。四个妹妹生下来都被溺死。可是现在他家住了新房，过着幸福的日子。一家八口，五口上学。自己已有两个儿子、三个女儿。几年来好几次上休养地去度假期。“过去哪谈得上劳动者有休息权？不休息也还要担心挨饿。”他曾经连续做过七个班，一连五十四小时在井下干活。失了业，到处流浪，还要过饭。
    不少代表同军队代表王维福、抚顺市代表王崇伦、辽宁省代表韦玉玺说得一样。韦玉玺说，国民党的法是老百姓挨打的法。王维福说，过去的法律是剥削工具。
    今天坐在主席台上的王崇伦曾经这样说，新中国的宪法是从人民群众当中，经过公开的讨论产生出来的宪法。“革命的老前辈们给我们打下江山，争来各项民主权利，我们要用宪法把每一项都固定下来，好好保持它们。我们要用实际行动，开展技术革新运动来保证宪法的实施。”带头遵守宪法是他们的共同誓愿。
    代表们也为了大会将要办的另一件大喜事而兴奋着。许多代表异口同声地说，当群众欢送他们来北京的时候，都嘱咐他们要选举最亲爱的人来做自己国家的领袖。
    军队代表王有根得到当选消息的时候，正在学校学习。许多同学和教师们来祝贺他，形成了一个座谈会。他们热情地说，最好在他投票的时候，也能把他们的名字签上。山西省代表曲耀离来北京的时候，拖拉机站上的人也来送，说千万要替他们也投一票。另一个山西省代表吴春安说，他动身的时候，社里的一个老社员，七十多岁了，特地奔跑过来招呼他，他还以为他要捎什么东西。可是老头儿说的，就是大家心里都有的那一句话。新疆省代表帕提汉·苏古尔巴也夫微笑地告诉记者，当他经过阿尔泰草地的时候，一个过去贫苦现在有了十几头牲口的哈族牧民握着他的手说不出话来，最后只说了一句：“一定要选他老人家啊！”
    从珠穆朗玛峰到鸭绿江边，从塔里木盆地到珠江三角洲，六亿人民怀着同样的心愿。这是中国的大喜日！六亿人民心上开了花！
