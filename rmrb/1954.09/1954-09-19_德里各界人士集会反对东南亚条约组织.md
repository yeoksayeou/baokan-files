Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 16th -- The National Committee of the Indian Conference Against the US-Pakistan Military Treaty and Advocating for Relaxation of International Tensions held a public gathering on the evening of the 15th to oppose the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO). Three hundred people from all walks of life in Delhi attended the conference, which was presided over by Indian Member of Parliament, Syed Nauser Ali.

    Indian Member of Parliament, Major General Sok, winner of the 1953 Stalin International Prize "For Strengthening International Peace," delivered a speech at the meeting. He said, "The principles of peaceful coexistence expounded in the Zhou Enlai-Nehru Joint Statement have become a powerful weapon in the hands of all peace-loving people in Asia. What will determine the fate of Asia is this principle, not the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization."
    Sundarlal, Chairman of the National Committee of the India-China Friendship Association, said:
  "We will never allow anyone from outside Asia to interfere in Asian affairs. How to defend ourselves is for us to decide, not for the United States or any other country to decide."
    Romesh Chandra, Secretary-General of the All-India Peace Council, said that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is an extremely great danger to India. Some people are attempting to drag India, along with all its strength and manpower, into this aggressive war bloc. Today, the only answer from the people of Asia and India to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is: Asian countries, regardless of their systems, should unite and strengthen peace in Asia based on the joint statement issued by Zhou Enlai and Nehru on the principles of peaceful coexistence.
    Also speaking at the meeting were Mrs. Rameshvari Nehru, a well-known Indian social worker, and Members of Parliament Dr. Anup Singh, Kidwai, Syed Ahmed, and others. They all condemned the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization as an aggressive organization preparing to provoke a new war in Asia, and pointed out the strong opposition of the people of Southeast Asia to this organization.
    The resolution condemning the Southeast Asia Treaty adopted at the meeting stated: "This is a clear attempt by Western countries to interfere in the lives of the Asian people, to divide them and turn them against each other, and to continue their domination over the Asian people." The resolution then pointed out that the Southeast Asia Treaty violates the Charter of the United Nations and runs counter to the decisions of the Geneva Conference. The resolution declared its firm confidence in the joint statement of Zhou Enlai and Nehru, and said, "This statement lays the correct foundation for relations between different countries." The resolution emphasized the necessity of opposing the Southeast Asia Treaty, saying:
  "Peace in Asia can only be achieved after the People's Republic of China is recognized and the Asian people are allowed to decide their own destiny without any foreign interference."

    德里各界人士集会反对东南亚条约组织
   【新华社新德里十六日电】印度反对美巴军事条约、主张缓和国际紧张局势大会全国委员会十五日晚举行公众集会，反对东南亚条约组织。参加大会的有德里各界人士三百人，会议由印度国会议员赛义德·纳乌塞尔·阿里主持。
    印度国会议员、一九五三年“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人索克少将在会上发表演说，他说：“周恩来—尼赫鲁联合声明中所阐述的和平共处的原则已经成为一切争取和平的亚洲人民手中的强有力的武器。将要决定亚洲命运的是这个原则而不是东南亚条约组织。”
    印中友好协会全国委员会主席森德拉尔说：
  “我们决不容许任何亚洲以外的人来干涉亚洲的事务。如何保卫我们自己，这要由我们来决定而不是由美国或其他国家来决定。”
    全印和平理事会秘书长罗米希·钱德拉说：东南亚条约组织对印度来说是一个极大的危险。有人企图把印度以及它的全部实力和人力拖入这个侵略性的战争集团。今天，亚洲和印度的人民对东南亚条约组织的唯一回答是：亚洲各国，不论它们的制度如何，应该根据周恩来—尼赫鲁就和平共处的原则所发表的联合声明联合起来加强亚洲的和平。
    在会上讲话的还有印度著名的社会工作者拉米希瓦里·尼赫鲁夫人，国会议员阿努普·辛格博士、吉德瓦尼、赛义德·艾哈迈德等。他们都谴责东南亚条约组织是一个准备在亚洲挑起新战争的侵略组织，并指出东南亚人民对于这个组织的强烈反对。
    会议通过的谴责东南亚条约的决议说：“这是西方国家的明显的企图，打算干涉亚洲人民的生活，分裂他们使之相互反对，和继续它们对亚洲人民的统治。”决议接着指出，东南亚条约是破坏联合国宪章的，它与日内瓦会议的决定是背道而驰的。决议宣布坚决信任周恩来和尼赫鲁的联合声明，并说，“这个声明为不同国家之间的关系奠下了正确的基础”。决议在强调指出必须反对东南亚条约时说：
  “亚洲的和平只有在承认中华人民共和国，和让亚洲人民在不受任何外国干涉的情况下自己决定他们自己的命运以后，才能够获得。”
