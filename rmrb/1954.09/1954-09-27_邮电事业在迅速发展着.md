    Postal and Telecommunications Services are Developing Rapidly
    Ma Ran
    China's postal and telecommunications enterprises are the nation's communication departments, communication tools for people to connect with each other. With the development of the nation's political, economic, and cultural undertakings, and the growth of the material and cultural lives of the broad masses of people, China's postal and telecommunications services have achieved rapid development in the past five years.
    The experience of Zhang Daozhong, a delegate to the National People's Congress and model youth postman, is an epitome of the development of postal and telecommunications work. When Zhang Daozhong joined the Yuci Postal and Telecommunications Bureau in Shanxi in 1948, the Yuci Postal and Telecommunications Bureau had a total of twenty-four people, of whom only five were rural postmen. Rural postal work only involved delivering letters to the district government seat every other day, not delivering to the villages. The route was only a few hundred *li* in total. The monthly volume of letters was less than 10,000, remittances 300, newspaper subscriptions 600, and long-distance calls only about a thousand. Now it is very different: the bureau has 88 employees, of whom 14 are rural postmen. The rural postal routes have reached 1,792 *li*, with daily delivery to the district and regular delivery to the villages. The monthly volume of letters has reached more than 58,000, remittances 2,600, newspaper and magazine subscriptions more than 10,500, long-distance calls more than 8,000, and telegrams more than 1,200. Zhang Daozhong himself has become a skilled postal worker, called a "living post office" by construction workers.
    The massive restoration work of the postal and telecommunications departments across the country began in 1950. In 1952, key construction began, with the construction and expansion of many postal routes, lines, and machinery and equipment. In August 1953, the postal route from Qamdo to Lhasa was established. Thus, postal and telecommunications were fully accessible from the coast in the east to the border in the west, from Manchuria to Hainan Island. At the same time, with the efforts and assistance of local governments, vast local telecommunications and rural postal and telecommunications networks were established. In terms of international communications, postal and telecommunications links were established and developed with the Soviet Union, Korea, and other people's democratic countries. At the end of 1950, with the great assistance and cooperation of the Soviet Union, wired telecommunications between Beijing and Moscow were realized, completing the world's longest direct long-distance telecommunications line. Original connections were also maintained with other countries. Radio facsimile telegrams were opened between Beijing, Shanghai, Moscow, and Berlin. We could see photos transmitted by radio on the same day of important gatherings and festivals in Moscow and Berlin.
    In the past five years, the development of equipment and business volume in postal and telecommunications enterprises has been unprecedentedly rapid. For example, compared with 1953 and 1949, the number of postal and telecommunications bureaus and offices has more than doubled, the total length of postal routes has more than doubled, of which rural postal routes reached 1.23 million kilometers, long-distance telecommunications lines increased by 65 percent, and urban telephones increased by 29 percent. Postal and telecommunications institutions were established and postal routes opened in many minority areas and grasslands. In terms of business volume, letters increased by 100 percent, remittances increased by 900 percent, parcels increased by 800 percent, telegrams increased by 140 percent, and long-distance calls increased by 200 percent. All of the above exceeded the level of the highest historical year—1936. In 1950, the integration of postal services and newspaper distribution was implemented, with the postal and telecommunications bureau responsible for the distribution of newspapers and magazines nationwide. In 1953, the total distribution volume of newspapers and magazines reached 1.792 billion copies. In 1951, Uyghur telegrams were also created in Xinjiang. This is beyond comparison with the postal and telecommunications enterprises of old China.
    The equipment of postal and telecommunications enterprises is gradually moving towards modernization. In long-distance telecommunications, carrier wave machines are used more and more, so that a pair of wires can play the role of many pairs. The proportion of automatic telephones in newly built urban telephones is increasing year by year. Beijing Post Office has installed a "roller belt conveyor," which partially automates the manual sorting of letters. The volume of mail transported by trains, ships, airplanes, automobiles, and other means on postal routes across the country is increasing day by day.
    In order to further meet the needs of industrial construction and other economic construction, postal and telecommunications departments have established postal and telecommunications bureaus and business offices in larger factories, mines, forest areas, and basic construction sites, and sent mobile service teams to serve in the mountains, forests, and wilderness. With the westward extension of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway and the Kangding-Tibet Highway, postal and telecommunications service personnel also move forward. There are hundreds of radio stations at flood control stations in the water conservancy departments, transmitting information on water level rises and falls along rivers; there are also hundreds of radio stations serving geological exploration, meteorology, highways, and forestry. These are all unprecedented in history.
    In the past five years, postal and telecommunications workers have actively carried out labor competitions, and many labor models have emerged nationwide. Guo Xiuyun, who was elected as a delegate to the National People's Congress this time, is the creator of advanced long-distance telephone operating methods and a nationally renowned labor model. Mao Xianqi, a mechanic at the auto repair shop of the Guizhou Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Administration Bureau and the current deputy director of the factory, and Liu Changgui, a technician from the Rehe Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Bureau, are both labor models and have been elected as delegates to the National People's Congress.
    Postal and telecommunications workers are making unremitting efforts to expand China's postal and telecommunications network, maintain smooth postal and telecommunications, and connect the central government and local governments, cities and villages, and friends and relatives separated by thousands of mountains and rivers at the fastest speed. Every postal and telecommunications worker knows that they are standing on the glorious post of national construction. As Guo Xiuyun said: "There are still many things we should do. Socialism must be realized by the labor of all of us. I will use redoubled efforts to better complete the task to answer the people's expectations and trust in me."

    邮电事业在迅速发展着
    马然
    中国的邮电企业是国家的通信部门，是人民相互联系的通信工具，随着国家政治、经济、文化事业的发展，和广大人民物质文化生活的增长，五年来，中国的邮电事业获得了迅速的发展。
    全国人民代表大会代表、模范青年邮递员张道中的经历，就是邮电工作发展的缩影。一九四八年张道中参加山西榆次邮电局工作时，榆次邮电局共有二十四个人，其中乡邮员只有五个人，乡邮工作只隔日往区政府所在地送信一次，不往乡里送信，路线总共不过数百里；每月的信函不到一万件，汇票三百张，报纸期发六百份，长途电话才千把次。现在大大不同了：全局职工已有八十八人，其中乡邮员十四人，乡邮路线已达一千七百九十二里，每天到区，定期到乡。每月信函达五万八千多件，汇票二千六百张，报刊期发一万零五百多份，长途电话来去转八千多次，电报来去转一千二百次。张道中本人已经成为熟练的邮工，被基本建设工人称为“活邮亭”。
    邮电部门在全国范围内巨大的恢复工作是从一九五零年开始的。一九五二年又开始了重点建设，新建和扩建了许多邮路、线路和机器设备。一九五三年八月建立了昌都到拉萨的邮路。从而东起沿海，西至边疆，从满洲里到海南岛的邮电通信完全通达。同时，在地方政府的努力和协助下，建立了广大的地方电信和乡村邮电通信网。在国际通信方面，建立和发展了与苏联、朝鲜和各人民民主国家的邮电联系。一九五零年底，在苏联的伟大援助和合作下，实现了北京——莫斯科的有线电通信，完成了世界上最长的一条直达长途电信线路。和其他国家也都保持着原来的联系。北京、上海和莫斯科、柏林间开放了无线电传真电报，莫斯科、柏林的重要集会和节日，我们当天就可以看到无线电传来的照片。
    五年来，邮电企业的设备和业务量的发展是空前迅速的。如以一九五三年和一九四九年相比，邮电局、所增加了一倍多，邮路总长度增加了一倍以上，其中乡村邮路达到一百二十三万公里，长途电信线路增加了百分之六十五，市内电话增加了百分之二十九。在许多少数民族地区和草原上设立了邮电机构，开辟了邮路。业务量方面，信函增加了一倍，汇兑增加了九倍，包裹增加了八倍，电报增加了一点四倍，长途电话增加了二倍。上述各项都超过了历史上最高年代——一九三六年的水平。一九五零年开始实行了邮发合一，由邮电局担负全国报刊的发行工作，一九五三年报刊发行总量已达十七亿九千二百万份；一九五一年在新疆还创办了维吾尔文电报；这更不是旧中国的邮电企业所可比拟的。
    邮电企业的设备逐步向近代化前进。长途电信方面更多地装用了载波机，使一对电线发挥许多对的作用。新建市内电话中自动电话的比重逐年增长。北京邮局已装用了“滚带传信机”，使人工分拣信件的工作部分自动化了。邮路上用火车、轮船、飞机、汽车等运送全国各地的邮件量日益增多。
    为了进一步满足工业建设和其他经济建设的需要，邮电部门在各较大的工厂、矿山、林区和基本建设工地设立了邮电局、营业处，并派出流动服务组，深入到大山、森林和野外去服务。随着兰新铁路、康藏公路的向西延伸，邮电服务人员也跟着前进。在水利部门防汛站上，有成百个无线电台，在沿江、沿河传递水位涨落的信息；为地质钻探、气象、公路和林业等服务的电台也是数以百计的。这都是历史上所没有的。
    五年来，邮电职工积极开展劳动竞赛，全国涌现出许多劳动模范。这次当选为全国人民代表大会代表的郭秀云就是长途电话先进操作法的创造者、全国著名的劳动模范。贵州省邮电管理局汽车修配厂的机务员、现任该厂副厂长茅显祺和热河省邮电局的技工刘长贵，都是劳动模范，并当选为全国人民代表大会的代表。
    邮电职工们正以不懈的努力，扩大着我国的邮电网，保持着邮电通信的畅通无阻，使中央和地方、使城市和乡村、使远隔千山万水的亲友，以最快的速度相互联系。每一个邮电职工都知道他们站在国家建设的光荣岗位上。正如郭秀云所说的：“我们应该做的事还很多，社会主义是要用我们大家的劳动来实现的，我要用加倍的努力，更好地完成任务，来答复人民对我的期望和信任。”
