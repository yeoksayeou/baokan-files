Xinjiang's People of All Ethnic Groups Advance Victoriously
National People's Congress Representative, Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, Bao Erhan (Uyghur)

One of the great achievements of the People's Republic of China is the correct resolution of domestic ethnic issues through the application of Marxist-Leninist theories on nationalities. In our country, genuine new relationships of equality, fraternity, unity, and cooperation have been established among all ethnic groups. All ethnic minorities enjoy equal rights in all aspects. Regional autonomy is implemented in areas where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities, and autonomous organs are established, enabling all ethnic groups to realize their right to manage their own internal affairs, develop their politics, economy, and culture according to their own characteristics, and gradually join the ranks of advanced nations.

Since 1933, the Chinese Communist Party has continuously dispatched its outstanding members to Xinjiang to serve the cause of liberation for the people of all ethnic groups. Chen Tanqiu, a member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, along with Mao Zemin, Lin Jilu, Qiao Guozhen, and many other revolutionary comrades, cultivated young people from all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, spread the seeds of communism, and made significant contributions to Xinjiang's liberation. Although these revolutionary comrades were later murdered by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agent Sheng Shicai, their blood was not shed in vain. The friendship between the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang and the Han people was established and consolidated in the struggle against common enemies.

After the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang Province in 1949, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and the great leader Chairman Mao, with the fraternal assistance of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang and the Han people, and the selfless aid of the great Soviet Union, the backward social landscape has undergone fundamental changes. The increasingly consolidated equality, fraternity, unity, and cooperation among all ethnic groups have replaced the past ethnic hatred and estrangement, and a vibrant new atmosphere is emerging in politics, economy, and culture. We can clearly see the achievements made in the past five years from the following facts.

After the liberation of Xinjiang Province, a people's democratic government was established, and political bandits organized by American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, such as Usman and Janim Khan, were eliminated. Subsequently, struggles such as resisting America and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and reducing rent and opposing local bullies were carried out, consolidating social order. From September 1952, land reform was victoriously carried out in the agricultural areas of nine special districts, more than fifty counties, three suburban districts of cities, and more than 1,500 townships, encompassing approximately four million people, except for the Altay Special District, enabling peasants to gain liberation from the feudal exploitation system. With the victory of land reform, mutual aid and cooperation are steadily developing in the vast countryside. There are now collective farms including 110 households with 70,000 mu of land; 79 agricultural production cooperatives including 1,425 households with 65,302 mu of land; and more than 50,000 mutual aid teams. The peasants participating in mutual aid and cooperation account for 33.84 percent of all peasants. There are also 344 supply and marketing cooperatives with 497,600 members. There are currently more than 310 tractors working in the agricultural areas of the province, which, calculated at 15 horsepower per tractor, is equivalent to more than 1,000 tractors. The peasants' enthusiasm for patriotic production is increasing day by day, and agricultural production is developing year by year. Now the province's cultivated area has increased by more than 30 percent compared with 1949, and grain output has increased by more than 50 percent. The peasants' living standards have improved and their purchasing power has increased. For example, the sales volume of clothing fabrics in the province in 1953 increased fivefold compared with 1950, and the sales volume of sugar increased threefold during the same period.

Animal husbandry has also developed rapidly, with the number of livestock increasing by more than 40 percent compared to before liberation. Before liberation, the people in the pastoral areas could only exchange one brick of Sichuan tea (brick tea) for one sheep; now they can exchange twelve bricks of tea for one sheep. Herdsmen of all ethnic groups have begun to live free and happy lives.

Before liberation, Xinjiang basically had no modern industry. After liberation, thanks to the active participation of the People's Liberation Army in industrial construction, the efforts of the people of all ethnic groups, and the selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union in all aspects, many modern socialist industries have now been established. The total value of industrial products in 1953 increased 36-fold compared with 1949. These industries not only meet part of the needs of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang for production and means of livelihood, but also create favorable conditions for building large-scale industries after the completion of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, playing a huge role in accelerating the development of agriculture, animal husbandry, and other national economies in Xinjiang, promoting socialist transformation, and developing the political, economic, and cultural undertakings of all ethnic groups. The working class of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang has also grown along with it.

With the development of production, the cultural, educational, and health undertakings in Xinjiang Province have also been greatly developed. The number of primary school students is now 77.5 percent higher than in 1949, and the number of middle school students and specialized school students has tripled compared with 1949. In 1953, 5.3 million books and periodicals were published, 65 percent of which were published in the languages of various ethnic groups. The province currently has 28 film projection teams and 16 cultural troupes; 198 medical institutions with more than 2,500 medical personnel, five times more than in 1949.

Xinjiang is a multi-ethnic region, with thirteen fraternal ethnic groups living in the province. Therefore, implementing ethnic regional autonomy has become a very important task in resolving ethnic issues. From October of last year to the present, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, four autonomous regions at the special district level have been established for the Mongolian, Hui, and Kirgiz ethnic groups; four autonomous regions at the county level have been established for the Hui, Xibe, Kazakh, and Tajik ethnic groups; seven autonomous regions at the district level have been established for the Mongolian, Hui, Kirgiz, and Daur ethnic groups; and nine autonomous regions at the township level have been established for the Xibe, Hui, Kirgiz, Tajik, and Mongolian ethnic groups, for a total of twenty-four autonomous regions. In addition, the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Region, equivalent to an administrative office level and including the three special districts of Ili, Tacheng, and Altay, and the Barkol Kazakh Autonomous County and Bortala Mongol Autonomous Prefecture, equivalent to county level, will be established successively within this year. Active preparations are currently underway to establish the Xinjiang Provincial Autonomous Region around May of next year.

Judging from the established ethnic autonomous regions, because all ethnic groups have realized the right to be masters of their own affairs, the political enthusiasm and patriotism of the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous regions have greatly increased, the friendship and unity among all ethnic groups and within ethnic groups have been further consolidated, the connection between the Party and the People's Government and the masses has become closer, and the enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups for developing production and the demand for developing culture and education have been unprecedentedly enhanced. The people of all ethnic groups are singing, "The water of the Tianshan Mountains will never run dry, and the kindness of Chairman Mao will never be forgotten!" These all specifically prove that the Chinese Communist Party's policy of ethnic regional autonomy is indeed the key to solving ethnic issues in our country. The following example further illustrates the improvement of the people's lives, the increase in production, and the development of culture and education in the autonomous region. In 1949, before liberation, the Kizilsu Kirgiz Autonomous Region had 252,400 head of livestock; now it has reached 632,500 head of livestock. That is, it has increased one and a half times. In 1949, there were 46 primary schools with 5,373 students; now there are 88 schools with 12,198 students, and there are 213 middle school students. In addition, there are 16 supply and marketing cooperatives and 3 hospitals and veterinary hospitals. Since liberation, 1,188 cadres have been trained.

Therefore, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, who were oppressed under reactionary rule in the past, have seen and realized in fact that only under the leadership of the Communist Party, with the working people holding political power, can genuine people's democracy be realized, ethnic oppression be completely eliminated, new and genuine friendly relations be established among all ethnic groups, and the backward state of ethnic minorities in politics, economy, and culture, inherited from history, be gradually eliminated, so that all ethnic groups can achieve genuine equality. Therefore, they unanimously guarantee that under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, under the shining light of the general line of the transition period, and with the fraternal assistance of the Han people, they will contribute all their strength to building a prosperous and happy socialist society.

The Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government attach great importance to training ethnic minority cadres. Up to now, more than 140,000 ethnic minority cadres have been trained nationwide through schools and other methods. From 1950 to 1951, seven ethnic institutes were established one after another in the central, northwest, southwest, central south, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi regions to train cadres for the implementation of regional autonomy and the development of political, economic, and cultural construction for various ethnic minorities in the country. The Central University for Nationalities was established on June 11, 1951. There are now 1,206 students from 46 different ethnic groups studying at the university.

    新疆各族人民在胜利前进
    全国人民代表大会代表 新疆省人民政府主席  鲍尔汉（维吾尔族）
    中华人民共和国的伟大成就之一，是运用马克思列宁主义关于民族问题的理论，正确地解决了国内民族问题。在我们国家里，各民族之间已经建立了真正的平等、友爱、团结、合作的新关系。各个少数民族在一切方面都享有平等的权利。少数民族聚居的地方实行区域自治，成立自治机关，使各个民族都能实现其管理本民族内部事务的民族自治权利，按照本民族的特点，发展其政治、经济和文化，逐步进入先进民族的行列。
    中国共产党从一九三三年起就陆续派遣了它的优秀的党员到新疆为各族人民的解放事业服务。中国共产党中央委员陈潭秋，以及毛泽民、林基路、乔国桢等许多革命同志在新疆培养了各民族青年，散播了共产主义的种子，对新疆的解放事业作了重大贡献。这些革命同志后来虽然都被蒋介石的特务盛世才杀害了，但是他们的鲜血并没有白流。新疆各族人民与汉族人民之间的友谊在反对共同敌人的斗争中建立和巩固起来。
    新疆省一九四九年和平解放后，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和伟大领袖毛主席领导下，在驻新疆人民解放军、汉族人民兄弟般的帮助和伟大苏联友邦无私的援助下，在各民族人民团结努力之下，落后的社会面貌已经有了基本的改变。各民族之间日益巩固的平等、友爱、团结、合作代替了过去的民族仇视和隔阂，政治、经济、文化各方面都呈现出一种欣欣向荣的新气象。我们从下面所举的事实可以明显地看出这五年中所获得的成绩。
    新疆省解放后，建立了人民民主政权，肃清了美国帝国主义、国民党反动派所组织的乌斯满、贾尼木汗等政治股匪。以后又进行了抗美援朝、镇压反革命、减租反恶霸等斗争，巩固了社会治安。并自一九五二年九月起除阿勒泰专区外，在九个专区，五十多个县，三个市郊区，一千五百多个乡大约包括四百万人口的农业区胜利地进行了土地改革，使农民们从封建剥削制度下获得了翻身解放。随着土地改革的胜利，在广大农村中，互助合作正在稳步开展。现在已拥有包括一百一十户的、有七万亩田地的集体农庄；有包括一千四百二十五户的、有六万五千三百零二亩田地的农业生产合作社七十九个；有互助组五万多个。参加互助合作的农民，占全体农民的百分之三十三点八四。并有供销合作社三百四十四处，社员已达四十九万七千六百人。全省的农业区目前并有三百一十多台拖拉机在工作着，如果按十五匹马力的拖拉机计算，就折合成一千多台。农民爱国生产的积极性一天天增涨，农业生产一年比一年发展。现在全省耕地面积比一九四九年增加了百分之三十以上，粮食产量增加了百分之五十以上。农民的生活得到了改善，购买力提高了。如全省一九五三年服装布料的销售量就比一九五○年增加了五倍，同时期糖的销售量增加了三倍。
    畜牧业也迅速地得到了发展，牲畜的数目比解放前增加了百分之四十以上。牧区人民解放前用一只绵羊才能换到川字大茶（砖茶）一块，现在用一只绵羊可以换得砖茶十二块。各族牧民都开始过着自由幸福的生活。
      解放前，新疆基本上是没有现代工业的。解放后由于人民解放军积极参加了工业建设，由于各族人民的努力和伟大苏联在各方面的无私援助，现在已经建立了许多现代化的社会主义的工业。一九五三年的工业产品总值，较一九四九年增加了三十六倍。这些工业不仅解决了新疆各族人民生产与生活资料的一部分需要，而且为兰新铁路建成后建设大规模的工业创造了有利的条件，对加速新疆农业、畜牧业和其他国民经济的发展、促进社会主义改造事业和发展各民族政治、经济、文化事业方面都起着巨大的作用。新疆各民族的工人阶级也随着成长起来了。
      随着生产的发展，新疆省的文教卫生事业也得到了很大的发展。现在小学生人数比一九四九年增加了百分之七十七点五，中学学生和专科学校学生都比一九四九年增加了三倍。一九五三年出版了书刊五百三十万册，其中百分之六十五是用各民族文字出版的。全省现有电影放映队二十八个，文工团十六个；有医疗机构一百九十八处，医务人员二千五百多名，比一九四九年增加了五倍。
      新疆是一个多民族的地区，全省居住着十三个兄弟民族，所以实行民族的区域自治便成为解决民族问题的一项非常重要的工作。从去年十月起至现在为止，在共产党和人民政府领导下成立了四个相当于专区级的蒙古族、回族、柯尔克兹族的自治区，四个相当于县一级的回族、锡伯族、哈萨克族、塔吉克族的自治区，七个相当于区一级的蒙古族、回族、柯尔克兹族、达呼尔族的自治区，九个相当于乡一级的锡伯族、回族、柯尔克兹族、塔吉克族、蒙古族的自治区，共计成立了二十四个自治区。此外，相当于行署级的包括伊犁、塔城、阿勒泰三个专区的伊犁哈萨克自治区和相当于县一级巴里坤哈萨克族自治区、布克赛尔蒙古族自治区等都将于今年内先后成立。目前正积极准备于明年五月前后成立新疆省的自治区。
    从成立了的各民族自治区来看，由于各民族实现了当家作主的权利，自治区内各族人民的政治积极性和爱国主义精神大大地提高了，各民族之间和民族内部的友爱团结更加巩固了，党和人民政府同人民群众的联系更加密切了，各族人民发展生产的积极性和发展文化教育的要求空前地提高了。各民族人民都高唱着“天山上的水永远流不完，毛主席的恩情永世不能忘！”这些都具体地证明了中国共产党的民族区域自治政策确是解决我国民族问题的钥匙。从下面的一个例子中更可以看出自治区人民生活的改善、生产的提高和文化教育的发展。克孜勒苏柯尔克兹族自治区，在一九四九年，即解放前有牲畜二十五万二千四百只，现在牲畜已达到六十三万二千五百只。也就是说增加了一倍半。一九四九年有小学四十六所，学生五千三百七十三名；现在有学校八十八所，学生一万二千一百九十八名，并有二百十三名中学学生。此外还有供销合作社十六处，有医院和兽医院三所，解放后，培养了干部一千一百八十八名。
    因此，从前在反动统治下遭受压迫的新疆各族人民已从事实上看到和认识到：只有在共产党领导下，劳动人民掌握了政权，才能实现真正的人民民主，彻底消灭民族压迫，在各民族之间建立新的真正的友爱关系，才能逐步消除历史上遗留下来的少数民族在政治上、经济上、文化上的落后状态，使各民族达到真正的平等。所以他们一致保证在党和人民政府的领导下，在过渡时期总路线的光辉照耀下，在汉族人民兄弟般的帮助下，为建设繁荣幸福的社会主义社会而贡献一切力量。（附图片）
    中国共产党和人民政府非常重视培养少数民族干部。到现在止，全国经过学校和其他方法培养出来的少数民族干部已有十四万多人。一九五○年至一九五一年，并先后创办了中央、西北、西南、中南、云南、贵州、广西等七个民族学院，为国内各少数民族实行区域自治以及发展政治、经济、文化建设培养干部。中央民族学院是一九五一年六月十一日成立的，现在在院学习的有四十六个不同民族的学生一千二百零六人。这是中央民族学院一部分学生的合影。
