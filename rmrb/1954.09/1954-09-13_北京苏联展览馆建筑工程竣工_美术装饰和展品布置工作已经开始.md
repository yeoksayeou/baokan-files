    Construction of the Beijing Soviet Exhibition Center Completed
    Art Decoration and Exhibit Arrangement Work Begins
    The construction of the Beijing Soviet Exhibition Center has been completed, and art decoration and exhibit arrangement work has begun.
    On September 8th and 9th, workers from the entire construction area and soldiers from a certain construction engineering unit of the People's Liberation Army worked day and night in intense labor, completing the construction of the open-air theater by dawn on the 10th. The roads around the exhibition center are now open to traffic. The one hundred and seventy-six fountains in the plaza's fountain pool are constantly spraying water. Up to this point, the Soviet Exhibition Center project, through the efforts of more than four thousand construction workers and soldiers from a certain construction engineering unit of the People's Liberation Army (reaching a maximum of more than eight thousand people), has been finally completed after eleven months. Workers are now carrying out final finishing touches and cleaning the site. The entire complex's landscaping project has also been completed, with a total of more than six thousand trees, more than fifty thousand flowers, and more than twenty thousand square meters of lawn planted.
    As the construction of various parts of the Soviet Exhibition Center were handed over one after another, more than forty art workers and more than one hundred art technicians from the capital enthusiastically participated in the art decoration and exhibit arrangement work of the Soviet Exhibition Center. They are painting huge hanging pictures as high as six or seven meters, installing various kinds of exhibit platforms and exhibit shelves, carefully deliberating on the arrangement of each exhibit, tacking up large-sized pictures one after another, and writing Chinese explanations on the exhibition pictures with various colors of paint. Through the active work of the art workers, all the art arrangement work is largely nearing completion. The exhibit platforms in the small exhibition hall and the cultural hall have all been decorated and are ready.

    北京苏联展览馆建筑工程竣工
    美术装饰和展品布置工作已经开始
    北京苏联展览馆的建筑工程已经竣工，并开始美术装饰和展品布置工作。
    九月八、九两日，全工区工人和人民解放军某建筑工程部队的战士，日夜展开了紧张的劳动，十日拂晓，完成了露天剧场工程。展览馆周围的马路现已通行无阻。广场上的喷水池的一百七十六个喷泉不时喷出水花。到此为止，苏联展览馆的工程，经过四千多建筑工人和人民解放军某建筑工程部队战士（最多时曾达八千多人）十一个月的努力，已经最后建成了。工人们现正进行最后修饰和清理现场的工作。全馆绿化工程也已经完工。共栽树六千多棵、花卉五万多株和草皮二万多平方公尺。
    随着苏联展览馆各部分建筑工程的先后交工，首都的美术工作者四十多人和美术技工一百多人，热烈参加苏联展览馆的美术装饰和展品布置工作。他们正在绘制高达六、七公尺的巨幅挂图，装设各种各样的展品台和展品架，仔细斟酌地布置每一件展品，把一幅幅的大型图片张钉起来，用各种颜色的油漆在展览图片上写中文说明。经过美术工作者的积极工作，全部美术布置工作已大体上接近完成。小型展览馆和文化馆的展品台已经全部装饰就绪。
