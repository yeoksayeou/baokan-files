Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 18th: "Pravda" published a lengthy article by Torkunov: "Six Hundred Million People of China and the United Nations."

The author writes: Recently, the movement among countries around the world advocating for the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations has been growing. This is one of the positive results of the Geneva Conference, which succeeded to a large extent due to the active participation of great China. Even many bourgeois politicians who generally hold ill will towards the People's Republic of China are currently undergoing a certain shift in attitude, turning to advocate for the restoration of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations.

The sole reason for this abnormal state of affairs, where six hundred million people of China are unrepresented in the United Nations, is the United States' policy of exacerbating international tensions. For nearly five years, American diplomacy has employed various means to obstruct the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations.

Torkunov then says: Seeing that many of the United States' allies are changing their attitudes under pressure from public opinion, agreeing with those who demand the immediate restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations, American diplomacy and propaganda have been making frantic efforts in recent times to deceive world public opinion and defend the United States' China policy.

In the United States, a special organization has even been established to collect signatures to oppose the acceptance of the People's Republic of China into the United Nations, in order to gather public opinion against the Chinese people.

However, the facts prove that even in the suffocating atmosphere of the United States—where a huge propaganda machine, including newspapers, radio, movies, television, etc., has been mobilized in the provocative movement against the People's Republic of China—more and more sober voices are being raised, demanding that the State Department revise its policy towards China.

The author points out: The United States' policy towards the People's Republic of China, which has lost touch with reality, has aroused strong dissatisfaction among broad sections of people in all countries of the world. It is particularly impossible to ignore the significant changes that have recently taken place in the United Kingdom on this issue. An increasing number of British newspapers of different persuasions, and an increasing number of public figures and politicians, are demanding the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations.

Among Asian countries, the United States' policy of disregarding the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations has been met with even stronger condemnation. The broad public in Asian countries understands very well what kind of purpose lies behind this dangerous policy of the United States.

An increasing number of Asian countries are actively advocating for the restoration of the People's Republic of China's rights in the United Nations.

The author then writes: The issue of restoring the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations is of great international significance. It is one of the most pressing issues in current international relations.

The calculation of the American ruling clique is: to obstruct the People's Republic of China from participating in the work of the United Nations, so that it can more easily pursue their "Cold War" policy. This is no secret to anyone. They are afraid of the voice of China, which has six hundred million people. At the same time, it is unwilling to lose the Chiang Kai-shek clique, this docile pawn, in the United Nations, a group that is able to exist to this day because it obeys the American representative's orders and supports any conspiracy of the American representative.

Recent international relations eloquently illustrate that the absence of China in the United Nations not only deprives the Chinese people of their sacred rights, but also seriously undermines the fundamental principles of the United Nations. The Kuomintang running dogs, who do not and cannot represent China, remaining in the United Nations is a gross violation of the United Nations Charter. The abnormal state of affairs in which representatives appointed by the legitimate government of a United Nations member state cannot participate in the work of the United Nations agencies also seriously undermines the United Nations Charter.

The American diplomacy's attack on the principles of the United Nations reflects the intention of the American ruling clique to dominate the world, to issue orders wantonly. This attack is damaging the foundation of the United Nations.

Torkunov concludes: Restoring the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations is in the interest of all peace-loving people. Doing so will enhance the prestige of the United Nations and will promote the easing of international tensions. Great China should occupy its rightful place in the United Nations organization and in the entire international relations system.

    六亿人口的中国和联合国
    ——“真理报”刊载的托尔库诺夫的文章的摘要
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十七日讯：“真理报”刊载了托尔库诺夫的一篇长文：“六亿人口的中国和联合国”。
    作者写道：近来，世界各国主张恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利的运动都在增长。这是日内瓦会议良好的结果之一，日内瓦会议所以得到成功在很大的程度上是由于伟大的中国的积极参加。甚至许多一般说来一贯对中华人民共和国不怀好意的资产阶级政治人物，目前也在态度上有某种转变，转而主张恢复中国在联合国的合法权利。
    造成六亿人口的中国在联合国中没有代表的这种不正常状态的唯一原因，就是美国的加剧国际紧张局势的政策。将近五年来，美国的外交为了阻挠中华人民共和国恢复在联合国中的合法权利，采取了各种各样的手段。
    托尔库诺夫接着说：眼看到美国的许多盟国正在舆论的压力下改变态度，赞同那些要求立刻恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利的人的意见，美国的外交和宣传在前一些时候进行了疯狂的努力，来蒙蔽世界舆论并为美国的对华政策进行辩护。
    在美国，为了收罗舆论来反对中国人民，甚至成立了一个为反对接受中华人民共和国进入联合国征集签名的专门组织。
    然而，事实证明，即使在美国这种窒息的气氛中——在那里，在反对中华人民共和国的挑衅运动中动员了庞大的宣传机器：报纸、广播、电影、电视等——也发出了越来越多的头脑清醒的声音，要求国务院修改对中国的政策。
    作者指出：丧失了现实性的美国对中华人民共和国的政策，引起世界所有国家广大阶层人民的强烈不满。尤其不能忽视的是最近在英国在这个问题上所发生的显著改变。越来越多的不同倾向的英国报纸，越来越多的公众领袖和政治人士都要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利。
    在亚洲国家中，美国无视中华人民共和国在联合国中合法权利的政策，遭到了更加厉害的谴责。亚洲各国广大的公众很懂得，在美国这个危险政策的后面有着什么样的目的。
    越来越多的亚洲国家积极地主张恢复人民中国在联合国的权利。
    作者接着写道：恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利问题是具有极大国际意义的。这是当前国际关系中最迫切的问题之一。
    美国统治集团的算盘是：阻挠中华人民共和国参与联合国的工作，以便它可以更易于奉行他们的“冷战”政策。这一点对谁都不是秘密。他们害怕拥有六亿人民的中国代表的声音。同时，它还不愿意在联合国中失去蒋介石集团这个百依百顺的走狗，这个集团之所以到今天还能够存在，是因为它对美国代表唯命是从，并且支持美国代表的任何阴谋。
    近年来的国际关系雄辩地说明了：联合国中没有中国不仅是剥夺了中国人民的神圣权利，而且是严重地破坏了联合国的基本原则。并不代表也不能代表中国的国民党走狗留在联合国里，是对联合国宪章的粗暴的破坏。一个联合国会员国的合法政府所指派的代表不能参加联合国各机构的工作，这一不正常的状态也严重地破坏了联合国宪章。
    美国外交对联合国原则的进攻，反映了美国统治集团要想统治世界、要想肆无忌惮地发号施令的意图。这种进攻正在损坏联合国的基础。
    托尔库诺夫最后说：恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利，符合一切爱好和平的人民的利益。这样做会提高联合国的威信，并将促进国际紧张局势的缓和。伟大的中国应当在联合国组织中以及在整个国际关系体系中占它应有的地位。
