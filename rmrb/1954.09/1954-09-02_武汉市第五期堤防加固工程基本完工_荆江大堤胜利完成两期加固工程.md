    Wuhan's Fifth Phase of Dike Reinforcement Project Basically Completed
    Jingjiang Dike Successfully Completes Two Phases of Reinforcement Project
    Wuhan’s 200,000-strong flood prevention army basically completed the fifth phase of dike reinforcement work on August 31st. During this phase, approximately 500 train cars, hundreds of trucks, and over a thousand boats transported more than 100,000 cubic meters of soil, rocks, and sand day and night from distances of tens to hundreds of miles, ensuring the basic completion of the project in about a week. The completion of this phase of dike reinforcement will prevent many new dangers that could arise on the dikes during prolonged high-water levels and the receding water period. In this phase, tens of thousands of cubic meters of stone and tens of thousands of sandbags were used to complete projects such as protective aprons outside the riverside flood walls, supporting many high and steep slopes. In areas where the flood walls were lower, protective works for secondary dikes were constructed using steel rails and reed mats. In the Hanyangmen area of Wuchang, where the riverside flood walls were prone to collapse, a long, wide, and solid secondary dike was newly built behind the flood wall. Some relatively weak flood walls below the Wuhan Customs building in Hankou were also reinforced using pressure grouting (cement slurry). The sections below the confluence of the Han River and the Yangtze River, which were being directly impacted by the currents, were protected by throwing down large amounts of rock to reinforce the slopes. Many ponds close to the dikes have mostly been filled in. Many dangerous sections of the Zhanggong Dike earthen dike are being further reinforced, with many earthen supports being added. Some dike sections that were previously built above deep pools, with very steep inner slopes and many hidden dangers, have had effective measures taken to reinforce them with stone. A group of experienced revetment workers from along the Yellow River also rushed to Wuhan to participate in the lower revetment dam construction project at Wutai Gate. For the first time, they brought the lower revetment experience that has been passed down for many years in the Yellow River basin for overcoming floods to the Yangtze River, helping the people along the Yangtze River fight against the floods. They are currently passing this technique on to a group of young workers and technicians in Wuhan.
    As of August 31st, Wuhan has been holding out at high-water levels above 28 meters for a full 50 days. Since the Yangtze River water level began to recede on August 19th, it has dropped 54 centimeters by August 31st. At 5:00 PM on August 31st, the Yangtze River water level at the Wuhan Customs building was 29.19 meters, exceeding the highest historical water level by 91 centimeters. It is still 2.89 meters above the Wuhan warning level. Wuhan's flood prevention teams are highly vigilant about new dangers that may arise during prolonged high-water levels, and are stepping up patrols of the dikes day and night to eliminate hidden dangers in a timely manner. Currently, there are over 10,000 flood prevention team members patrolling the dikes day and night in Wuhan, and over 20,000 people are in dedicated rescue teams. There are still over 110,000 people continuing to work on the dikes. (Xinhua News Agency)

    The Jingjiang Dike has successfully completed two phases of reinforcement work, and the dike body has been further consolidated.
    Since the beginning of the summer flood season this year, the Jingjiang Dike has withstood five severe flood peaks in succession, but many dangers have appeared in the dike body. Until the beginning of August, flood peaks from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River continued to arrive. In order to finally overcome the floods, the Jingjiang Flood Diversion and Flood Prevention Headquarters, after on-site inspection and detailed research, formulated a plan to reinforce the Jingjiang Dike in two phases. The first phase of the project started in early August and was successfully completed after nearly half a month of efforts by tens of thousands of workers. On August 14th, the Yangtze River water level in Shashi fell below 43 meters. At this time, the second phase of the project began, which involved trenching in the dangerous sections, repairing the loopholes and depressions in the dike body, in order to discover and eliminate hidden dangers in a timely manner. Currently, the second phase of the project has also been basically completed. The newly discovered soil layers, large and small holes, ant nests, etc. in the dangerous sections have all been repaired and filled. The two phases of the project involved a total of 227,000 cubic meters of earthwork.
    After two phases of reinforcement work, the important dangerous sections of the Jingjiang Dike can withstand the impact of floods in excess of the highest historical water level, and can avoid serious dangers in the dike body during the receding water period. The Jintuo section of the Jingjiang Dike, which is 24 kilometers long, has not been tested by floods for 20 years and had many hidden dangers. Thanks to timely reinforcement, it successfully withstood the test of the highest flood level in history on August 8th.
    Since mid-August, the Jingjiang water level has gradually decreased. However, according to estimates of the incoming water from the upper reaches, there will be severe flood peaks appearing in the Jingjiang again soon. In order to consolidate the achievements already made and strive for final victory, the people on both sides of the Jingjiang River are continuing to heighten their vigilance, inspect and repair dangerous works and sections.

    武汉市第五期堤防加固工程基本完工
    荆江大堤胜利完成两期加固工程
    武汉市二十万防汛大军，已在八月三十一日基本完成第五期加固堤防的工程。这期加固堤防工程中，每天约有五百多个火车车皮、几百辆汽车和一千多只船，日夜不停地从几十里以至几百里外，运来十多万公方的土、石块和沙子，保证工程在一个星期左右即基本完工。这期加固堤防工程的完工，使武汉市在高水位持续时期和退水期中堤防上可能发生的许多新的险情得以预防。这期工程中，用了几万方石头和几万个沙袋，完成了沿江防水墙外护脚等工程，支撑着许多高而陡的坡岸。在防水墙较低的地段，又用钢轨和芦席等物料做了子堤的防护工程。在武昌的汉阳门一带，沿江防水墙容易崩塌的地段，已在防水墙后面新筑了很长一道宽厚结实的子堤。在汉口武汉关以下有些比较薄弱的防水墙，也已用压力灌浆（水泥浆）办法进行加固。在汉水和长江汇流的堤段下面被激流顶冲的部分，已抛下大量石块护坡。紧靠堤防的许多水塘，大部都已填平。张公堤土堤上的许多险工，也正进一步加固，做了许多土撑。有些过去建在深潭上面的堤段，内坡很陡，隐患较多，已采取有效办法抛石加固。黄河沿岸一批有经验的埽工，也赶来武汉市参加加固武泰闸的下埽筑坝工程。他们把黄河流域多年流传下来的战胜洪水的下埽经验第一次带到长江来，帮助长江沿岸人民和洪水作斗争。他们正在把这个技术传授给一批武汉青年工人和技术人员。
    到八月三十一日止，武汉市已在二十八公尺以上的高水位下整整坚持五十天。从八月十九日长江水位开始回落以来，到八月三十一日已下落五公寸四。八月三十一日下午五时，武汉关长江水位为二九点一九公尺，和历年最高水位比较，还超过九公寸一。比武汉警戒水位还高出二点八九公尺。武汉市防汛队伍正十分警惕着在高水位持续时期可能发生新的险情，日夜加紧巡查堤防，及时消除隐患。目前在武汉堤防上日夜巡逻堤防的防汛队伍有一万多人，专门抢险的队伍达二万多人。继续在堤上施工的人员还有十一万多人。（新华社）

    荆江大堤已胜利完成两期加固工程，堤身进一步得到巩固。
    今年夏汛以来，荆江大堤虽然接连经受了五次险恶洪峰的考验，但堤身出现不少险情。直到八月初旬，长江上游洪峰还不断下来。为了最后战胜洪水，荆江分洪防汛指挥部经过实地检查和详细研究，订出了分两期加固荆江大堤的计划。第一期工程从八月初开始，经过几万民工近半个月的努力后胜利完成。八月十四日，沙市长江水位落到四十三公尺以下。这时又开始了第二期工程，在各险段进行抽槽，翻筑堤身的漏洞和跌窝，以便及时发现和消灭隐患。目前第二期工程也基本完成了。各险段发现的新土层、大小洞、蚁穴等，都已修补填好。两期工程共做土方二十二万七千公方。
    荆江大堤经过两期加固工程后，各重要险段可在超过历年最高水位情况下抵挡住洪水的冲击，并可避免退水时堤身发生严重的险情。长二十四公里的荆江大堤金托段，已有二十年未经洪水考验，隐患很多，由于及时加固，八月八日胜利地经历了历史上最高洪水位的考验。
    八月中旬以来，荆江水位逐渐降落。但根据上游来水估计，最近荆江又将有险恶洪峰出现。为了巩固已得成绩和争取最后胜利，荆江两岸人民正继续提高警惕，检查和整修险工险段。
