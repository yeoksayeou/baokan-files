The Advancing Cause of General Education
Sun WenShu, Representative to the National People's Congress, Director of Secondary Normal Education Department, Ministry of Education

I.

Let me first cite some basic figures. The number of students in secondary schools nationwide was 1,267,000 in 1949 and 3,628,000 in 1953, an increase of over 286%; the number of students in primary schools nationwide was 24,391,000 in 1949 and 51,154,000 in 1953, an increase of over 211%. These figures show that China's general education has made great progress in the past five years.

The characteristic of the development of people's general education is that it has always implemented the policy of "serving the workers and peasants." Over the past five years, tens of thousands of workers' and peasants' children have joyfully poured into the gates of schools. Before liberation, in Shanghai, whether in public or private schools, the number of workers' children attending school was very small, and some schools simply did not allow the children of the working people to enroll. After liberation, in addition to enrolling a large number of workers' and peasants' children in general schools, the People's Government also planned to increase schools and classes in workers' residential areas. In 1952 alone, more than 40,000 workers' and peasants' children entered secondary schools, normal schools, and secondary vocational schools such as industrial, electrical, medical, and nursing schools. The schools for children of employees in factories and enterprises across the country have greatly developed. For example, during the reactionary rule, all factories and mines run by bureaucratic capitalists in Shanxi Province never ran elementary schools for employees' children. Now, the state-owned and local state-owned factory and mining enterprises in Shanxi Province have more than 15,300 employees' children studying in 40 elementary schools for employees' children. The number of students in schools for children of employees in the national railway system has increased from 117,000 in 1950 to 200,000 in 1953.

In the vast countryside, peasants are sending their children to school with joy and excitement.

According to the 1953 statistics, workers, peasants and other working people’s children accounted for more than 80% of the total number of students in primary schools nationwide; and 60.9% in secondary schools (excluding secondary technical schools). This fundamental change in the composition of students marks the great achievements in the implementation of the policy of "serving the workers and peasants."

It is particularly worth mentioning that the People's Government established 58 workers' and peasants' accelerated secondary schools in five years. In the summer of 1953, the first group of 1,680 graduates from the workers' and peasants' accelerated secondary schools had 1,622 admitted to universities for further studies, including 60 preparatory students for study in the Soviet Union. The latter will go to study in the Soviet Union after a period of Russian language study in China.

The education of ethnic minorities is an integral part of the people's education, and it has also made rapid progress in the past five years. Under the cruel oppression of successive reactionary rulers, most ethnic minorities had no access to culture and education at all. Before liberation, it was impossible to find a literate person within dozens of miles of the Miao ethnic area in western Hunan, and some Li people in Hainan Island also had a vague concept of numbers. This state of illiteracy is now rapidly changing. The People's Government has established a large number of ethnic minority schools in various ethnic minority areas. Now, there are 26,436 ethnic minority primary schools with more than 2.5 million students; 233 ethnic minority middle schools with more than 130,000 students. These schools all use their own national languages for teaching. The development of ethnic minority education can be said to be very rapid. Taking Wuqia County in Xinjiang Province, where education is the most backward, as an example, there were only 35 primary school students in the entire county during the Kuomintang reactionary rule. By 1953, it had increased to 948. In areas that were liberated earlier, such as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the enrollment rate of school-age children has reached over 80%, and the enrollment rate of school-age children in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region in Jilin Province has reached 94.1%. The children of the working people of all fraternal ethnic groups are actively and happily learning in the united and friendly big family of the motherland.

II.

In order to meet the needs of national construction and accomplish the glorious task of "cultivating comprehensively developed members of socialist society," the national general education has made many efforts in rectification, consolidation, and quality improvement in the past five years.

Today, the political quality of our students is not comparable to that of students trained by the old education. Our students are cultivated with patriotism and internationalism, and with the idea of serving the people. The action of hundreds of thousands of young students responding to the call of the motherland in 1951 to volunteer to join various military cadre schools concentratedly demonstrated the high political awareness and patriotic enthusiasm of our students. Today's students generally have a clear political direction, and millions of young students have joined their own advanced organizations - the Youth League and the Young Pioneers. The new generation is receiving socialist education in schools, the Youth League, and the Young Pioneers. The idea of "everything for the motherland" has taken root in the hearts of students and is becoming their action.

Clear learning goals and full learning enthusiasm are one of the guarantees for the gradual improvement of students' academic performance. What is particularly exciting here is the achievements of workers and peasant cadres and industrial workers studying in workers' and peasants' accelerated secondary schools. Most of them had very low cultural levels when they entered school, but after unremitting efforts, they all completed the courses of ordinary middle schools in Chinese, mathematics, physics, chemistry, politics, history, geography, biology, and sports in three or four years, basically meeting the requirements of the teaching plan, and improving from the original level of higher elementary school to the level of high school graduation. The proportion of students with excellent academic performance is very large. For example, among the graduates of the Workers' and Peasants' Accelerated Secondary School attached to Peking University this summer, 75% of the students in science and engineering classes received full marks or 4 marks in key courses, and students in liberal arts classes almost all received full marks and 4 marks in key courses. Tian Guiying, the first female train driver in New China, who studied at the Workers' and Peasants' Accelerated Secondary School attached to the Northeast Institute of Technology, received full marks in six courses.

Generally speaking, the academic performance of middle and primary school students across the country is improving year by year, and the number of outstanding students is increasing year by year. In the early days of liberation, the learning quality of students in Beijing No. 8 Middle School was very low, and failing exams was a common phenomenon. In 1950, more than 100 high school graduates took the university entrance examination, and only a dozen were admitted. However, major changes have taken place in recent years, and students' academic performance has been increasing year by year. In the first semester of 1951, students with scores above 80 accounted for only 46% of all students, and in the first semester of 1953, it reached 82%. Last summer vacation, 100% of high school graduates were admitted to universities, with a total average score of over 60 in each subject. Before liberation (second half of 1948), repeat students in Nanjing No. 1 Middle School accounted for 18.3% of the total number of students, which had dropped to 2.57% in the first half of 1953.

The health of students has greatly improved. This is because the people's material life has generally improved after liberation, because schools across the country have begun to implement Chairman Mao's "three goods" instructions and the State Council's "Decision on Improving the Health of Students at All Levels of Schools," and because students consciously and actively exercise. The records of many schools show that the proportion of healthy students is gradually increasing, while students' diseases are gradually decreasing. For example, according to a survey conducted by Dalian Middle School in 1953, compared with the statistics in 1939, the average height of boys in each grade increased by 2.7 centimeters, and the weight increased by more than 2 kilograms. This is a gratifying phenomenon.

III.

Here, I would like to make a special narration that, in the past five years, the cause of general education has cultivated a strong reserve force of labor for the front lines of industrial and agricultural production in our country.

The great achievements of the motherland's economic construction are encouraging young students to actively participate in construction. In the past year, labor education has begun to be strengthened in schools, and many young students regard labor as a glorious cause. Now, millions of higher elementary and junior high school graduates have participated in industrial and agricultural production. A factory in Harbin once absorbed 100 junior high school students in 1950. Now, most of them have become foremen, technicians, dispatchers, and inspectors, and some have even become workshop directors.

A large number of higher elementary and junior high school graduates have become builders of the new rural life. They have played an active role in the mutual aid and cooperation movement and in various rural work, especially cultural work. All 109 higher elementary school graduates from peasant families in Chaoshui Township, Penglai County, Shandong Province, have joined agricultural production cooperatives or mutual aid teams. Last autumn, there were only two mutual aid teams in the entire township, and this spring there were already two agricultural production cooperatives and 138 mutual aid teams. In the rapid development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Chaoshui Township, the active actions of higher elementary school graduates in mobilizing their parents and neighbors to join the teams and cooperatives have played a great role. In Xichuan County, Henan Province, as of April this year, 1,283 higher elementary school graduates had participated in agricultural production. Among them, 135 people participated in the work of the township people's government, 166 people became teachers in people's schools, 94 people became party propagandists, 145 people became broadcasters, 64 people became bulletin board staff, 135 people became newspaper readers, and 227 people participated in the work of rural troupes.

Higher elementary and junior high school graduates who participate in agricultural production have made great efforts in learning production skills and learning and promoting advanced experience and scientific farming methods. During this process, they have been tempered, and many of them have become production experts and become the backbone of mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Junior high school graduate Lu Genze and higher elementary school graduate Xu Jianchun are outstanding representatives of them.

In the future, a large number of higher elementary and junior high school graduates will participate in agricultural production every year. The Party and the People's Government will strive to train them and make them a force for building a new socialist countryside.

IV.

The development and progress of general education are inseparable from the development and progress of normal education. The Party and the government attach great importance to normal education. In the past five years, normal education has made great progress. Now, there are 31 higher normal schools nationwide, with nearly 40,000 students, an increase of about 92% compared with the highest year (1947) during the Kuomintang reactionary rule; 791 secondary normal schools, with more than 369,000 students, an increase of about 50% compared with the highest year (1946) during the Kuomintang reactionary rule. In the past five years, normal schools have supplied more than 30,000 teachers to secondary schools across the country and about 300,000 teachers to primary schools across the country. In order to cultivate the new generation of the motherland, these young teachers are striving to learn from the Soviet Union's advanced educational experience and improve teaching quality. Many teachers actively study teaching outlines and textbooks; some often prepare lessons late at night; some are not only conscientious and responsible in classroom teaching, but also patiently tutor outside of class; and some study hard and learn humbly from old teachers to make up for their lack of knowledge and experience and strive to complete teaching tasks.

Normal schools must not only continuously supply teachers to general education, but also strive to ensure the quality of teachers. In this regard, normal schools have already done a lot of work. The normal schools inherited from old China were not only too few in number, but also had disordered systems, complex courses, outdated teaching content, and teaching methods divorced from reality, which were completely unable to meet today's needs for cultivating people's teachers. After the establishment of New China, normal education underwent a series of reforms. The new school system promulgated in 1951 determined that normal education has its own education system, and all higher normal schools are independently established. Among teachers, ideological remoulding learning movements were successively launched, and on this basis, teaching reforms were carried out based on the principle of combining learning from the Soviet Union with Chinese reality, and teaching quality was gradually improved.

In order to overcome the imbalance between the supply of teachers and the rapid development of the people's education, the Party and the People's Government have paid great attention to the development of normal education. This year, the unified enrollment and distribution ratio of higher education institutions nationwide shows that the enrollment quota of normal schools accounts for 27.6% of the total quota, second only to engineering and ranking second. According to the plan of the Ministry of Education, in the next five years, on the one hand, higher normal and secondary normal schools will be expanded and continue to be added (more than 20 new higher normal schools are planned to be established); on the other hand, various forms of temporary transitional measures will be adopted to train more teachers and appropriately meet the urgent needs of general education.

The people's general education is advancing. It bears a glorious and important mission. As people's educators, we are proud of the glorious mission we shoulder. We will strive for new and greater achievements in the cause of people's education with arduous labor.

    前进中的普通教育事业
    全国人民代表大会代表 中央教育部中等师范教育司司长  孙文淑
    一
    让我先来引用一些基本数字。全国中等学校学生人数一九四九年是一百二十六万七千多人，一九五三年是三百六十二万八千多人，即增加到百分之二百八十六以上；全国初等学校学生人数一九四九年是二千四百三十九万一千人，一九五三年是五千
  一百五十万四千人，即增加到百分之二百一十一以上。这些数字说明，我国普通教育事业在五年内有了巨大的发展。
    人民的普通教育事业发展的特点是：它始终贯彻着“为工农服务”的方针。五年来，成千上万的工农子女欢欣鼓舞地涌进了学校的大门。解放以前的上海，无论公立和私立的学校里，工人子女上学的人数是很少的，有些学校根本就不准劳动人民的子女入学。解放后，人民政府除了在一般学校里大量招收工农子女入学外，并在工人居住区有计划地增校增班，仅一九五二年就有四万多工农子女进入了中学、师范和工业、电机、医务、护士等中等专业学校。全国工厂企业的职工子弟学校有了很大的发展。例如，在反动统治时期，山西省所有官僚资本家办的厂矿根本没有办过职工子弟小学，现在山西省国营和地方国营的厂矿企业部门，已有一万五千三百多个职工子女，在四十所职工子女小学校里学习。全国铁路系统职工子弟学校学生人数已由一九五○年的十一万七千人，增加到了一九五三年的二十万人。
    在广大农村，农民们怀着喜悦和激动的心情，把自己的子女送入学校。
    据一九五三年度的统计，全国初等学校中，工人农民和其他劳动人民的子女已占学生总数的百分之八十以上；中等学校（不包括中等技术学校）中占百分之六十点九。学生成分的这一根本变化，标志着“为工农服务”的方针的实施，取得了巨大的成绩。
    值得特别提出的是，人民政府在五年内创办了五十八所工农速成中学。一九五三年暑期，工农速成中学的第一批毕业生一千六百八十人，有一千六百二十二人升入高等学校继续深造，其中包括六十名留苏预备生。后者在国内经过一个时期的俄文学习，就要到苏联留学。
    少数民族教育是人民教育事业的一个组成部分，五年来它同样也有了突飞猛进的发展。在历代反动统治者的残酷压迫下，大部分少数民族人民从前是根本谈不上文化教育的。解放前湘西苗族聚居区几十里内找不到一个识字的人，海南岛有些黎族人民对数目的概念也是模糊的。这种无文化的状态现在正在迅速地改变着。人民政府在各少数民族地区创办了大量的少数民族学校。现在，全国少数民族小学已达二万六千四百三十六所，学生二百五十余万人；少数民族中学二百三十三所，学生十三万多人。这些学校都用自己本民族的语言进行教学。少数民族教育发展可以说是十分迅速的。拿新疆省教育工作最为落后的乌恰县来说，在国民党反动统治时期，全县只有三十五个小学生，到一九五三年，已增加到九百四十八人。在解放得较早的地区，例如内蒙古自治区，学龄儿童入学率已达百分之八十以上，吉林省延边朝鲜族自治区学龄儿童入学率已达百分之九十四点一。各兄弟民族劳动人民的孩子们，在祖国团结友爱的大家庭里，积极愉快地学习着。
    二
    为了适应国家建设的需要，完成“培养社会主义社会全面发展的成员”的光荣任务，全国普通教育五年来在整顿巩固，提高质量方面，做了不少努力。
    今天我国学生的政治质量和旧教育所培养出来的学生是不可同日而语的。我们的学生是以爱国主义和国际主义思想、以为人民服务的思想培养起来的。一九五一年数十万青年学生响应祖国号召，志愿报名参加各种军事干部学校的行动，集中地表现了我国学生的高度的政治觉悟和爱国热情。今天的学生一般都有着明确的政治方向，数百万青少年学生参加了自己先进的组织——青年团和少年先锋队。新的一代在学校、青年团、少年先锋队受到社会主义的教育。“一切为了祖国”的思想已经深入学生的心，而且，正在成为他们的行动。
    明确的学习目标和饱满的学习情绪是学生学习成绩逐步提高的保证之一。这里特别使人兴奋的是在工农速成中学学习的工农干部和产业工人们的成绩。他们大多数人在入学时的文化水平是很低的，但是经过顽强的努力，他们都在三、四年内学完了普通中学的语文、数学、物理、化学、政治、历史、地理、生物、体育等课程，基本上达到教学计划的要求，由原有的高小上下的水平提高到了高中毕业的程度。学业成绩优秀的学员的比数很大。例如，北京大学附设工农速成中学今年暑假的毕业生中，理工科班学生重点课程成绩全得五分、四分的占四分之三，文科班学生重点课程几乎全是五分和四分。在东北工学院附设工农速成中学学习的新中国第一个女火车司机田桂英有六门课程都得五分。
    总的说来，全国中、小学学生的学习成绩一年比一年在提高，优秀学生逐年增加。北京市第八中学在解放初期，学生的学习质量是很低的，考试不及格是普遍现象。一九五○年高中毕业生一百多人考大学，只取了十几个人。可是最近几年起了重大的变化，学生学习成绩逐年在上升。一九五一年度上学期，全校八十分以上的学生只占全体学生的百分之四十六，一九五三年度上学期就达到了百分之八十二了。去年暑假，高中毕业生百分之百地考上了大学，各科总平均分数在六十分以上。南京市第一中学，解放前（一九四八年下半年）留级学生占学生总人数的百分之十八点三，一九五三年上半年已降低到百分之二点五七。
    学生们的健康状况大大改善了。这是由于解放后人民的物质生活已经普遍提高，由于全国学校开始贯彻毛主席“三好”的指示和政务院“关于改进各级学校学生健康状况的决定”，由于学生们自觉地积极地锻炼，许多学校的记录表明：健康学生的比重在逐渐增加，而学生的疾病在逐渐减少。例如一九五三年大连中学的调查，和一九三九年的统计对比，各年级男生身体平均增加二点七公分，体重增加二公斤以上。这是可喜的现象。
    三
    这里我要特别叙述一下，五年来，普通教育事业为我国工农业生产战线培养了一支强大的劳动后备军。
    祖国经济建设事业的伟大成就，鼓舞着青年学生积极地参加建设。最近一年来学校中开始加强劳动教育，许多青年学生把劳动看作是光荣的事业。现在已有数百万高小和初中毕业生参加了工农业生产。哈尔滨某工厂一九五○年曾吸收一百名初中学生，现在，他们绝大部分都已成了工长、技术员、调度员、检查员，个别的还当了车间主任。
    大批的高小和初中毕业生成了农村新生活的建设者。他们在互助合作运动当中，在农村的各项工作特别是文化工作当中，都发挥了积极作用。山东蓬莱县潮水乡一百零九名农民家庭出身的高小毕业生，全部参加了农业生产合作社或互助组。去年秋天，全乡仅有两个互助组，今年春天已经有两个农业生产合作社，一百三十八个互助组。在潮水乡互助合作运动的迅速发展中，高小毕业生的积极动员家长和邻居入组入社的行动，是起了很大作用的。在河南淅川县，到今年四月为止，已有一千二百八十三名高小毕业生参加了农业生产。在他们当中，有一百三十五人参加了乡人民政府的工作，一百六十六人当了民校教师，九十四人当了党的宣传员，一百四十五人当了广播员，六十四人当了板报员，一百三十五人当了读报员，二百二十七人参加了农村剧团的工作。
    参加农业生产的高小和初中毕业生，在学习生产技能，学习和推广先进经验、科学耕作方法方面，作了很大的努力。在这当中，他们得到了锻炼，其中有不少人已经成了生产能手，成为互助合作组织中的骨干分子。初中毕业生吕根泽和高小毕业生徐建春，就是他们的出色代表。
    今后，每年都会有大量的高小和初中毕业生参加农业生产，党和人民政府将要努力培养他们，使他们成为建设社会主义新农村的力量。
    四
    普通教育事业的发展和进步，是和师范教育的发展和进步分不开的。党和政府十分重视师范教育。五年来，师范教育已经有了很大的发展。现在全国有三十一所高等师范学校，学生将近四万人，和国民党反动统治时期最高年（一九四七年）相比，增加了约百分之九十二；中等师范学校七百九十一所，学生三十六万九千多人，和国民党反动统治时期最高年（一九四六年）相比，增加了约百分之五十。五年来，师范学校已为全国中等学校输送了约三万名以上的教师，为全国小学输送了约三十万名教师。为了培养祖国的新一代，这些年轻的教师努力学习苏联的先进教育经验，提高教学质量。许多教师积极钻研教学大纲和教材；有的常常深夜还在备课；有的不仅课堂教学认真负责，而且在课外耐心辅导；有的则苦学苦读，虚心向老教师学习，以弥补自己知识和经验的不足，努力完成教学任务。
    师范学校不仅要源源不断地为普通教育供应师资，而且要努力保证师资的质量。在这方面，师范学校已经作了许多工作。旧中国遗留给我们的师范学校，不仅数量过少，而且系统紊乱，课程庞杂，教学内容陈旧，教学方法脱离实际，是完全不能适应今天培养人民教师的需要的。新中国建立之后，师范教育即进行了一系列的改革。一九五一年颁布的新学制，确定师范教育有自己的教育体系，高等师范学校全部独立设置。在教师中间，相继开展了思想改造的学习运动，并在这样的基础上，根据学习苏联和中国实际相结合的原则，进行了教学改革，逐步提高了教学质量。
    为了克服师资供应和人民教育事业迅速发展两者之间所存在的不平衡状态，党和人民政府对于师范教育的发展给予了极大的注意。今年全国高等学校统一招生分配比例，师范学校招生名额占总名额的百分之二十七点六，仅次于工科，而列于第二位。按照中央教育部的计划，在今后五年内，一方面要扩大和继续增设高等师范以及中等师范学校（仅高等师范学校即拟新设二十余所）；另一方面，要采取多种形式的临时的过渡办法，以培养更多的师资，适当满足普通教育事业的迫切需要。
    人民的普通教育事业在前进。它担负着光荣而重大的使命。作为人民的教育工作者，我们为自己所肩负的光荣使命而自豪。我们将以艰辛的劳动争取人民教育事业的新的更重大的成就。
