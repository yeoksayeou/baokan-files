Xinhua News Agency, Paris, September 2nd: The French newspaper "l'Humanité" published a statement by the Central Committee of the French Communist Party regarding the establishment of a collective security system and the support of peace.

The statement pointed out: The French National Assembly's rejection of the "European Defense Community" treaty is a victory in the cause of striving for peace and for the national independence of France. The statement said: "'European Defense Community' guarantees the rule of Krupp Germany over the whole of Western Europe, and therefore it means the end of France. 'European Defense Community' guarantees the revival of a new German Wehrmacht and divides Europe into two hostile camps, and therefore it accelerates the arms race and leads to new wars. The rejection of the 'European Defense Community' is a heavy blow to the military plans of the American imperialists, as well as to the Adenauer and Bonn militarist group."

The statement said: Some political figures in France are trying hard to find a new form of rearming Germany after the "European Defense Community" was rejected. "But it is very clear that doing so is contrary to the wishes of the whole country, because the French people expressed their opposition to the 'European Defense Community', first and foremost, to express their opposition to arming Germany in any form... Some say that arming Germany is inevitable, and that France can only choose what form to arm Germany, this statement is not correct. There is another path leading to a just and lasting peace, which is to establish a European collective security system that includes all European countries without exception. Today, such a decision can be made."

The statement, in mentioning the Soviet government's proposal on this issue, specifically pointed out: "For the sake of peace, France should take some measures so that the four major powers can immediately negotiate on all these issues. France should pursue an independent foreign policy that is in line with the national interests of France."

The statement also called on the French working people to strengthen unified action and fight for peace and the security of France.

    法国共产党中央委员会发表声明
    号召争取建立欧洲集体安全体系
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社巴黎二日讯：法国“人道报”刊载了法国共产党中央委员会关于建立集体安全体系和拥护和平的声明。
    声明指出：法国国民议会拒绝了“欧洲防务集团”条约，这是争取和平和争取法国民族独立的事业中的一个胜利。声明说：“‘欧洲防务集团’保证克虏伯德国统治整个西欧，因而它意味着法国的末日。‘欧洲防务集团’保证复活新的德国国防军和使欧洲分裂为两个敌对阵营，因而它加速扩军和导致新的战争。拒绝‘欧洲防务集团’，这是对美国帝国主义者的军事计划、以及对阿登纳和波恩军国主义集团的一个沉重的打击。”
    声明说：法国有些政界人物在“欧洲防务集团”被拒绝之后竭力想找出一种重新武装德国的新的形式。“但是十分明显，这样做是违背全国的愿望的，因为法国人民表示反对‘欧洲防务集团’，首先就是表示反对以任何形式来武装德国……有人说，武装德国是不可避免的，法国所能够选择的只是采取什么形式来武装德国，这种说法是不对的。导向公正的、持久的和平的另一条道路是有的，这就是建立起毫无例外地包括一切欧洲国家在内的欧洲集体安全体系。今天，可以作出这样的决定。”
    声明在提到苏联政府对这一个问题的建议时特别指出：“为和平着想，法国应该采取一些措施，以便四大国就这一切问题立即进行谈判。法国应该执行符合法国民族利益的独立的外交政策。”
    声明中还号召法国劳动人民加强一致行动，为和平和法国的安全而奋斗。
