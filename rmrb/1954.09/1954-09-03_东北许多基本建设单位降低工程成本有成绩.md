Many basic construction units in Northeast China have achieved considerable success in reducing project costs this year.

The Anshan Iron and Steel Works Rolling Mill Construction Company reduced costs by 11.8 billion yuan in the first half of the year. The Rolling Mill Construction Company adopted mechanized construction on a large scale, actively promoted advanced experience, and effectively mastered labor planning. In the second quarter, it saved 12,000 workdays in three months. The average work efficiency of all workers in the company exceeded the newly set quota by about 25%, and the labor productivity of the entire company exceeded the planned target by 17%. This alone reduced costs by 1.4 billion yuan. While ensuring project quality, the company tried its best to use inexpensive or recycled materials to replace others. For example, they implemented a Soviet expert's suggestion to replace lightweight glass with foamed concrete, which saved more than 4 billion yuan. The company earnestly mobilized employees to offer rationalization proposals and find shortcuts, which also saved a lot of wealth. In addition, the No. 2 Construction Site of the No. 2 Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration had completed 32% of its cost reduction plan by the end of July, saving the state 796.8 million yuan in construction funds. The six construction sites of the former Liaoxi Province No. 1 Engineering Company, which started construction in the first phase, generally formulated plans to reduce project costs by 6% to 10%, and so far, most of them have overfulfilled their plans. The No. 3 Construction Site of the Dalian Engineering Area saved the state more than 890 million yuan in materials alone in projects costing more than 9 billion yuan.

    东北许多基本建设单位降低工程成本有成绩
    东北各地许多基本建设单位今年在降低工程成本方面取得了相当成绩。
    鞍钢轧钢建筑工程公司在上半年工程中，降低成本达一百一十八亿元，轧钢建筑工程公司大量采用机械施工，积极推广先进经验并切实掌握劳动计划，第二季度三个月内就节省了一万二千个工作日。该公司全体工人工作效率平均超过新定额百分之二十五左右，全公司劳动生产率超过计划指标百分之十七。仅此一项，即降低成本十四亿元。该公司在保证工程质量的前提下，尽量利用廉价材料或回收材料来代替，如他们实行了以泡沫混凝土代替轻量玻璃这一项苏联专家建议，即节约资金四十多亿元。该公司认真发动职工提合理化建议，找窍门，也节约了大量财富。此外，有色金属工业管理局第二工程公司第二工地，到七月底已经完成降低成本计划百分之三十二，为国家节省了七亿九千六百八十万元的建设资金。原辽西省第一工程公司所属第一期开工的六个工地，普遍编制了降低工程成本百分之六到百分之十的计划，到目前为止，大都超额实现了自己的计划。大连工区第三工地在造价九十多亿元的工程中，仅材料一项就为国家节约了八亿九千多万元。
