    Presenting a Gift to the National People's Congress
    Farmers Across the Country Strive to Increase Grain and Cotton Production and Sell Surplus Grain
    [Reported by this newspaper] Farmers across the country are using practical actions of increasing grain and cotton production and selling surplus grain to welcome the convocation of the First Session of the First National People's Congress.
    Farmers in Hubei Province are working hard to cultivate late autumn crops and enthusiastically sell surplus grain. Since cheering on their cooperative director Rao Xingli (a representative from Hubei Province attending the National People's Congress), members of the Rao Xingli Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xishui County have been working hard in the fields from dawn till dusk every day. More than 300 mu of paddy fields throughout the cooperative have been completely planted with late autumn crops. They guarantee to increase production by another 40,000 jin of grain to sell to the state as a gift to the National People's Congress. Members of the Minli and Shengli Agricultural Production Cooperatives in Gongjiaqiao Township, Wuchang, have mobilized these days to work hard to pump and water the fields, and cultivate late autumn crops. Hong Wansheng, a farmer in Pengxing Township, Xiaogan County, borrowed 300 jin of cake fertilizer from the government this year and harvested an additional 700 jin of rice. He decided to sell 1,700 jin of surplus grain to the state. In Guangji County, the daily market volume of grain was originally only 70,000 jin. When the broad masses of farmers heard the good news that the National People's Congress would be held on September 15, the market volume of grain surged to 150,000 jin. According to statistics from the four special districts of Xiaogan, Jingzhou, Huanggang, and Yichang, as of September 1, farmers had sold more than 61.8 million jin of plump new grain to the state.
    Farmers in Liaoning Province are actively launching a production increase and yield preservation campaign to further increase grain production by 100,000 tons throughout the province. According to statistics from ten counties including Yixian and Fengcheng, it is estimated that grain production can be increased by 46,800 tons. Many areas have planted buckwheat and autumn vegetables on fallow land and land with missing seedlings of tobacco. At the same time, work such as loosening the soil in autumn, removing large weeds, applying base fertilizer, and draining water from waterlogged areas is being carried out. In Xin Jin County, 35,900 hectares of cotton, peanut, and sweet potato fields have been weeded. In order to promote early cotton boll opening and strive for more pre-frost flowers, topping and pruning have been widely carried out on 245,000 hectares of cotton throughout the province. The cotton fields of the Gongyi Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Fourth District of Jinxi County, which have been pruned and had their soil loosened in the autumn, have matured ten out of every six cotton bolls earlier. Farmers in waterlogged areas along the river are actively carrying out drainage and seedling support work under the slogan "Harvesting one more plant is one more plant." The Jiangdafang Village in Xin Jin County has dug 36 drainage ditches and built two culverts, freeing 120 hectares of farmland from internal waterlogging, which can increase grain production by 350 shi. Farmers in various places are also carrying out autumn protection work to reduce crop losses and welcome the autumn harvest. Members of the Yongfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shuangcheng County, Heilongjiang Province, in order to celebrate the convocation of the National People's Congress, in addition to selecting high-quality wheat to pay agricultural taxes to the state and planning to sell 30,000 jin of wheat to the state, have also adopted various methods to ensure the realization of the plan to increase grain production by 120 jin to 160 jin per hectare of large field.
    Farmers throughout Shandong Province who are engaged in the autumn harvest are rejoicing over the upcoming convocation of the National People's Congress, and their enthusiasm for production has been further enhanced. The students of the mutual aid and cooperation training class in Yucheng County wrote a letter to Zhao Zhiqiang (Hui nationality, female), a representative to the National People's Congress and Deputy County Head of Yucheng County, to bring to the National People's Congress. They stated that in order to support the liberation of Taiwan and welcome the convocation of the National People's Congress, they will further improve the late-stage cotton trimming, pest control, weeding, and soil cultivation and fertilization of sweet potatoes and peanuts, carefully harvest, and strive to increase cotton production by another ten jin per mu, sweet potato production by another fifty jin per mu, and corn and soybean production by another ten jin per mu. Members of the Patriotic Vegetable Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Qingdao City used their evening rest time to discuss and decide to grow vegetables well and supply the needs of urban and rural people in a timely manner in order to welcome the convocation of the National People's Congress. Ji Qizhang, the director of the cooperative, proposed to strive to sell the existing eight mu of radishes and head cabbages in a short period of time, and plant spinach, garland chrysanthemum, and mustard as soon as possible to increase production as a gift to the National People's Congress.

    【本报讯】各地农民正以增产粮食、棉花和出售余粮的实际行动，迎接第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的召开。
