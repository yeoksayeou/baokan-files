    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 20th: The Czechoslovak "People's Front Newspaper" published an article on the 18th commenting on the First Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China.
    The "People's Front Newspaper" pointed out: The convening of the First Session of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China is not only a major historical event in China's domestic political life, but also a historical event for the whole world. It is the first time in Chinese history that representatives freely elected by the people have met to pass laws for the benefit of the people and to decide on matters concerning their lives and work, as well as the happiness and future of China. The brilliant victory of the Chinese revolution was further consolidated on September 15, 1954. The "People's Front Newspaper" continued: The National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China and the entire Chinese people now face the great tasks of defending the fruits of the revolution, building socialism, and safeguarding world peace. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and guided by the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism and the rich and advanced experience of the Soviet Union, the Chinese people will surely be able to successfully complete these tasks.
    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 20th: According to the Albanian Telegraph Agency, Albanian newspapers widely commented on the opening of the First Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China on the 17th. The newspapers believe that this meeting is the most prominent event since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949.
    "People's Voice Newspaper" wrote: The First Session of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China is being held at a time when the Chinese people have made significant achievements in various aspects of domestic democratic reform, and the prestige of New China has greatly increased on the international stage. The communique on the results of the implementation of the national economic development and national plan of the People's Republic of China in 1953, which was published on the eve of the opening of the meeting, clearly shows the achievements of various sectors of the national economy.
    "People's Voice Newspaper" continued, the historically significant resolutions to be adopted by the National People's Congress will pave the way for more new victories in the future. The newspaper emphasized that the great Chinese people are determined to move forward along the road of building socialism, determined to unite and defend the motherland, and to liberate Taiwan, an inseparable part of Chinese territory. Despite the provocations of the enemies of peace—the US aggressor group and its running dogs, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang—no force in the world can stop the great Chinese people from advancing.
    "People's Voice Newspaper" concluded: The Albanian people are paying close attention to the work of the First Session of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China and congratulate the convening of this meeting. They wish the Chinese people, who have a deep friendship with them, new victories in the common struggle for building socialism and safeguarding world peace.
