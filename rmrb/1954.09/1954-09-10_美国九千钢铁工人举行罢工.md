Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 6th (TASS dispatch) – Reuter reports that workers at twelve metallurgical factories in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Texas have gone on strike. Approximately nine thousand members of the United Steelworkers of America are participating in the strike. The striking workers are demanding wage increases.

The news agency reports that on September 1st, workers in the open-hearth furnace workshop of a "Republic Steel Corporation" factory in Cleveland, Ohio, stopped work to protest the company's attempt to reduce the daily work hours to four and lower workers' wages. In Fall River, Massachusetts, dockworkers refused to unload cargo delivered to the "Firestone Tire & Rubber Company." The strike by workers at this company, who are fighting for wage increases, has persisted for three weeks. The Fall River branch of the Grocery and Confectionery Workers Union has also donated money to support the striking workers at this company.

    美国九千钢铁工人举行罢工
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社纽约六日讯：据报联社报道，宾夕法尼亚州、马里兰州、得克萨斯州的十二家冶金工厂的工人举行罢工。参加罢工的有钢铁工人工会约九千名会员。罢工工人要求增加工资。
    据这家通讯社报道，九月一日俄亥俄州克利夫兰的“共和钢铁公司”一家工厂的马丁炉车间工人已停止工作，抗议公司企图把每天工作时间缩短到四小时并降低工人工资。在马萨诸塞州福尔河城，码头工人拒绝把运到“费尔斯通轮胎橡胶公司”的货物从船上卸下来。这家公司的工人为争取增加工资而举行的罢工已经坚持三个星期了。杂货糖果工人工会福尔河城分会也捐款支援这家公司的罢工工人。
