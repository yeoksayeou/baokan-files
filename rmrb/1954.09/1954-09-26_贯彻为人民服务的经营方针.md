Implement the Management Policy of Serving the People

Tong Shaosheng, Representative of the National People's Congress, Deputy General Manager of the Joint Public-Private Minsheng Shipping Company

The Minsheng Shipping Company was transformed into a joint public-private enterprise in September 1952. Under the leadership of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Transport and local Party committees, and relying on the efforts of the broad masses, the enterprise has undergone fundamental changes in the past two years.

The old Minsheng Company had a bloated organization, poor management, rampant corruption and waste, and frequent maritime accidents, resulting in long-term historical losses. Shareholders did not receive dividends, and employees' salaries were not paid on time. Even after liberation, these serious corrupt practices continued. From January 1950 to June 1952 alone, the company lost a total of 130 billion yuan, an average daily loss of 140 million yuan. Domestic debt increased by approximately 80 billion yuan, an average daily increase of approximately 90 million yuan. The economic situation was extremely difficult. Despite the strong assistance from the People's Government, with loans totaling approximately 160 billion yuan, the fundamental nature of the enterprise's corruption was not changed, severely hindering the development of production. Inefficiency, high costs, frequent accidents, and large deficits made it impossible to meet the needs of the country and society. Under these circumstances, the company's board of directors requested the People's Government to form a joint public-private enterprise. With government approval, the company was officially reorganized into the Joint Public-Private Minsheng Shipping Company on September 1, 1952.

The characteristic of the old enterprise's management was disregard for the needs of the country and the people, emphasis on unreasonable transportation costs, and demands for excessively high freight rates to meet unreasonable expenditures. When there was little cargo, they engaged in price-cutting competition, and when there was a lot of cargo, they raised prices to seek exorbitant profits. For example, in 1951, the government called for the transportation of Sichuan grain downstream, but the company manipulated the shipping capacity of the Sichuan River, insisting on excessively high freight rates, raising the freight rate from Chongqing to Shanghai to over 1.23 million yuan per ton. This resulted in losses for both the public and private sectors. The country's grain could not be transported out, and the company's ships had no cargo to transport. After the joint venture was established, the policy of low profits and high volume and the principle of serving the people were implemented. First, empty tonnage was used to transport grain at a 40% discount, reducing the freight rate from Chongqing to Shanghai to over 430,000 yuan per ton, securing a large amount of Sichuan grain for transport.

In 1953, the volume of Sichuan grain transported increased by 330% compared to 1952. This not only solved the company's cargo source and increased income but also greatly increased the purchasing power of farmers. For example, before Sichuan grain was transported out, the grain price in some areas was as low as 500 yuan per jin, with prices but no market. After the freight rate was reduced and a large amount of Sichuan grain was transported out, the price immediately increased to 750 yuan per jin, thereby revitalizing the southwestern market and playing an important role in Sichuan grain supporting national construction. Secondly, it supported production and transportation construction. The total amount of steel billets and rails transported by ships in 1953 alone was enough to lay 1,746 kilometers of railway. Thirdly, in order to facilitate passenger transport along the Sichuan River and the exchange of goods in small ports, the company overcame the past profit-seeking mentality of emphasizing long-distance routes and neglecting short-distance routes, opening short-distance routes such as Yichang to Badong, Wanxian to Yichang, and Wanxian to Chongqing. The production materials and living materials needed by various industrial and agricultural production departments along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River were also supplied through ship transportation, ensuring supply.

After the joint public-private venture was established, efforts were also made to reduce transportation costs, improve transportation efficiency, and implement safe production. First, the advanced Soviet experience was promoted and studied. The single-row towing method and pushing method were promoted on the entire Yangtze River, greatly unleashing the potential of horsepower. In the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the average cargo transported per horsepower increased from 1.2 tons to 4.34 tons. On the Sichuan River, the average cargo transported per horsepower by Xia-character tugboats increased from 0.38 tons to 1.08 tons. Other passenger and cargo ships and cargo ships were also fully towed, reducing the average cargo transported per six horsepower to two horsepower. Secondly, education facing production and ships was carried out. A port reform movement for fast loading and unloading was launched. The organization was adjusted, forms and reports were simplified, equipment was replenished, and port operation plans and voyage operation plans were implemented, thereby increasing loading and unloading efficiency by 62.76%. Non-productive berthing time was reduced, and the turnover rate of ships was accelerated. At the same time, a major safety and health inspection campaign was launched in early 1953 and the first half of 1954, with the goals of 20,000 kilometers of safe navigation on the Sichuan River and 30,000 kilometers of safe navigation on the Yangtze River, and a 180-day accident-free safety movement in the ports. In the course of implementation, the Minzu ship set a new record of 49,700 kilometers of safe navigation in 1953. At the same time, a strict periodic maintenance system was established, reducing the occurrence of engine failures, thereby reducing the occurrence of maritime accidents in 1953 by 52.88% compared to 1950, and reducing the mortality rate due to maritime accidents by 92.1%. In the future, safety measures will be further strengthened to eliminate major maritime accidents. Due to the reduction of transportation costs, the improvement of transportation efficiency, the implementation of safe production, and the promotion of planned management, the country was provided with a large volume of high-quality and low-priced transportation capacity. After the joint venture was established, the volume of cargo transported from September to December 1952 increased by 133% compared to January to August of the same year, and the annual volume increased by 42% compared to the previous highest annual volume. In 1953, the volume of cargo transported increased by 90% compared to 1952, successfully overfulfilling the country's transportation tasks.

Because the enterprise was thoroughly transformed, transportation costs were reduced, and transportation efficiency was improved, the historical losses were reversed, and there was a surplus. From September to December 1952, a surplus of over 12 billion yuan was obtained. In 1953, the profit from the Yangtze River shipping sector alone reached 52.2 billion yuan. In terms of completing the country's tax revenue tasks, from 1952 to the first half of 1954, over 32 billion yuan in business tax and over 68 billion yuan in income tax were paid, accumulating over 100 billion yuan in funds for national industrialization. This is beneficial to the country. Furthermore, due to the implementation of specialized management, the disposal of subsidiary businesses and stagnant materials, plus basic depreciation, etc., a total of 266.4 billion yuan in basic construction funds could be accumulated in 1953 and 1954 for basic construction mainly focused on ships, and the deadweight tonnage was greatly increased. Among them, the Yangtze River deadweight tonnage alone increased by 82.51% compared to 1952, playing a significant role in ensuring the completion of the ever-increasing transportation tasks. On the basis of developing production, the welfare of employees was correspondingly improved. In 1953 and 1954, a total of 25.3 billion yuan was invested in employee welfare facilities. This is beneficial to the employees. At the same time, because the leadership attached importance to the work of the board of directors and the interests of the shareholders, and established normal public-private relations, the company's shareholders had not received dividends or bonuses for more than ten years before the joint venture. Therefore, the role of the board of directors was limited and became a formality. Most directors and supervisors did not attend meetings, and shareholders' meetings were suspended. After the joint venture was established, shareholders' meetings were convened to distribute dividends due to the surplus, and the board of directors was reorganized. A democratic approach was adopted for major issues, with prior consultations and resolutions by the conference. The company's directors and supervisors all felt that they had responsibilities and powers. After the joint venture was established, in addition to convening meetings of the board of directors and the standing committee, two shareholders' meetings were held to determine the share value and distribute a total of 2.4 billion yuan in dividends and bonuses for private shares from September to December 1952 and 1953. The shareholders were very happy and satisfied.

With the needs of the country's large-scale economic construction, the company's transportation tasks have increased year by year. In order to meet the requirements of national construction, we will continue to deepen socialist transformation and, in conjunction with the transformation of enterprises, carry out ideological transformation of people to create conditions for the final transformation of state capitalist economy into a socialist economy. This is the direction and goal we will further strive for in the future.

    贯彻为人民服务的经营方针
    全国人民代表大会代表 公私合营民生轮船公司副总经理  童少生
    民生轮船公司是一九五二年九月改为公私合营。在中央交通部长江航运管理局及各地党委领导下，依靠广大群众的努力，两年来企业已起了根本的变化。
    旧民生公司，机构臃肿，管理不善，贪污浪费，海损事故，层出迭现，造成了历史上长期的亏折现象，股东领不到红息，职工薪水也不按时发出。一直到解放以后，还继续存在着这样严重的腐朽情况。单从一九五○年一月至一九五二年六月，就亏损共达一千三百亿元，平均每天亏损一亿四千万元，国内债务共增加约八百亿元，平均每天增加约九千万元，经济情况陷于非常困难境地，虽经人民政府大力帮助，贷款总额约达一千六百亿之多，但由于企业的腐朽性质没有根本改变，以致严重地阻碍了生产的发展，效率低、成本高、事故多、亏空大、不能适应国家与社会的要求。在这种情况下，公司董事会向人民政府要求公私合营，经政府批准，从一九五二年九月一日起，正式改组为公私合营民生轮船公司。
    旧企业经营的特点，是不顾国家和人民的需要，强调不合理的运输成本，要求过高的运价来满足不合理的开支，货少时压价竞争，货多时抬价图取暴利。例如一九五一年政府号召川粮下运，而公司操纵了川江运力，坚持过高的运价，由重庆到上海每吨运价抬高到一百二十三万余元，结果造成公私两不利，国家的粮食运不出，公司的船又没有货运。自合营后，贯彻了低利多运的政策和为人民服务的方针，首先利用空吨六折运粮，将重庆至上海的每吨运价减低至四十三万余元，争取了川粮大量出川。
  一九五三年的川粮运量较一九五二年增加了百分之三百三十。不但解决了公司的货源，增加了收入，更大大提高了农民的购买力，如当时川粮在未出川以前，有些地方粮价每斤低到只有五百元，有价无市，自从减低运价川粮大量出川以后，每斤价格即立增为七百五十元，因而活跃了西南市场，并发挥了川粮支援国家建设的重要作用。其次，支持了生产和交通建设，通过船舶运输的钢胚、钢轨，单是一九五三年的全年总运输量，就可铺设铁路一千七百四十六公里。再次，为了便利川江沿岸客运及小港货物交流，克服了过去重长航不重短航的唯利思想，开辟了宜昌至巴东，万县至宜昌和万县至重庆等短航班船，以及对长江中下游沿岸各工农业的生产部门所需要的生产资料和生活资料，都通过了船舶的输送，保证了供应。
    公私合营以后，对降低运输成本，提高运输效率，以及贯彻安全生产各方面，也都作了努力。首先推广学习苏联先进经验，在长江全线推行一列式拖带法和顶推法，大大的发挥了马力的潜在力。长江中下游，平均每马力运货由一点二吨提高到四点三四吨，川江峡字号拖轮下水平均每马力运货由○点三八吨提高到一点○八吨，其他客货轮及货轮也充分拖驳，因此由过去平均六匹马力运一吨货，降低到二匹马力运一吨货。其次进行了面向生产面向船舶的教育，展开了快装快卸的港务改革运动，调整了组织，简化了表报，充实了设备，推行了港湾作业计划和航次作业计划，因而装卸效率提高了百分之六十二点七六。减少了非生产的停泊时间，加速了船舶运行的周转率。同时在一九五三年初和一九五四年前半年开展了安全卫生大检查运动，以川江安全航行二万公里，长江安全航行三万公里为努力目标，和港湾一百八十天不出事故的安全运动。在贯彻执行当中，出现了民族轮一九五三年安全航行四万九千七百公里的新纪录。同时建立了严格的定期检修制度，减少了轮机方面的事故发生，因而使一九五三年海损事故的发生，较一九五○年降低了百分之五十二点八八，因海损事故而发生的死亡率，降低了百分之九十二点一。今后更要进一步加强安全措施，为消灭重大海损事故而努力。由于降低了运输成本，提高了运输效率，贯彻了安全生产，并推行计划管理，也就为国家提供了量大、质好、价廉的运力。合营后，一九五二年九至十二月完成货运吨量比同年一至八月增加了百分之一百三十三，全年比以往最高年运量增加了百分之四十二。一九五三年运量比一九五二年又增加了百分之九十，胜利地超额完成了国家的运输任务。
    由于企业得到彻底的改造，降低了运输成本，提高了运输效率，就扭转了历年的亏损，有了盈余。从一九五二年九月至十二月就获得盈余一百二十余亿元，一九五三年利润，单是长江航运部分即达五百二十二亿元。在完成国家的税收任务方面，从一九五二年到一九五四年的上半年止，缴纳营业税三百二十多亿元，缴纳所得税是六百八十多亿元，为国家工业化积累资金一千亿元以上。这是对国家的好处。又由于进行了专业化经营，处理了附属事业和呆滞物料，加上基本折旧等，在一九五三、一九五四两年，共能积累基本建设资金二千六百六十四亿元，进行以船舶为主的基本建设，载重量获得很大的提高，其中单是长江载量较一九五二年增加了百分之八十二点五一，在保证完成日益增加的运输任务方面，起着很大的作用。在发展生产的基础上，相应的改善了职工的福利。一九五三、一九五四两年来，在职工福利设施方面，共投资二百五十三亿元，这是对职工的好处。同时由于领导上重视了董监会工作与股东的利益，树立了公私正常关系，公司在合营前十多年来股东就不曾分过股息和红息，因此董事会作用不大，流于形式，多数董监事不出席董监会，而股东大会也停开了。合营后几个月，由于有了盈余，就召开股东大会发了股息，并改组了董监会，对重大问题，采取了事先协商会议议决的民主方式，公司董监事都感到有职有权了。合营后，除召开了董监会及常董会外，并开了两次股东大会，确定了股值，发给了一九五二年九至十二月和一九五三年私股股息红利共二十四亿元，股东们都非常高兴和满意。
    随着国家大规模经济建设的需要，公司所承担的运输任务，逐年增加，为了满足国家建设的要求，今后将继续深入社会主义改造，并结合企业的改造，进行人的思想改造，为最后改变国家资本主义经济为社会主义经济而创造条件，这是我们今后要进一步努力的方向和目标。
