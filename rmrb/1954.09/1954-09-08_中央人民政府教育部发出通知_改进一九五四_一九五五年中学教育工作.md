The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government Issues a Notice to Improve Secondary School Education Work in 1954-1955

The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government recently issued a "Notice on Improving Secondary School Education Work in the 1954-1955 Academic Year," requiring local education administrative departments to conscientiously implement the "Instructions on Improving and Developing Secondary School Education" from the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government.

The notice stated: In order to correctly implement the "Instructions on Improving and Developing Secondary School Education" from the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government and effectively improve the quality of secondary school education, education departments and bureaus in all provinces and cities across the country must first attach sufficient importance to improving the quality of secondary school leading cadres and teachers.

For secondary school leading cadres, the focus should be on improving their political theory, policy thinking, and educational theory level. The methods can include running rotational training classes for current principals and directors of teaching affairs, conducting planned rotational training for principals and directors of teaching affairs with lower quality; having principal responsible cadres from education departments and bureaus organize principals and directors of teaching affairs in stages and batches to conduct inspection work, thereby improving their policy and professional level; adopting methods such as experience exchange meetings, report meetings, and major issue discussion meetings, as well as conscientiously organizing and leading the on-the-job learning of principals and directors of teaching affairs for education and improvement. In order to enable them to focus their main efforts on leading teaching work, the excessively heavy off-campus work burden of some principals and directors of teaching affairs should also be reduced. In the future, with the continued development of secondary school education, secondary school leading cadres must also pay attention to planned cultivation and promotion from within the school. Based on past experience, the cultivation method can be to absorb a portion of teachers who may be cultivated as school leading cadres to participate in various training organizations, conferences, or other activities to improve current principals and directors of teaching affairs; establish a reserve cadre system, where general secondary schools can add deputy positions based on conditions, and particularly well-conditioned secondary schools should be required to have the responsibility of cultivating secondary school leading cadres.

Regarding strengthening teachers' political, cultural, and professional learning, the notice requires: In terms of cultural learning, local education administrative departments should strengthen leadership and improve teaching work in existing teacher training colleges and expand their development based on possible conditions. Provinces and cities that have not yet established training colleges should strive to open them based on possible conditions. Provinces and cities that have planned to conduct correspondence education should assist local higher normal schools in actively preparing. Those that currently do not have the capacity to prepare should, based on possible conditions, use the language and mathematics correspondence materials compiled by Northeast Normal University to organize some teachers for learning in order to accumulate experience. For this type of correspondence learning, provincial and municipal education departments and bureaus should set up specialized agencies or full-time cadres to take on administrative leadership and learning guidance work, or lead through local teacher training colleges based on possible conditions. In terms of political theory learning, provinces and cities can currently organize teachers to study according to the unified arrangements of the local Party committee. In terms of educational theory learning, some teachers can be organized to participate based on the specific conditions of each region and school. In terms of professional learning, under the premise of strengthening the organizational leadership of teaching, lectures on specific topics, experience report meetings, observation teaching, and public teaching can be organized in conjunction with the research of teaching materials and teaching methods. In order to further improve the work in the new academic year, the notice also requires local education administrative departments to focus on summarizing the successful experiences accumulated by secondary school leading cadres and teachers in their practical work over the past few years.

The notice believes that provincial and municipal education departments and bureaus should also pay attention to conducting in-depth inspections and strengthening specific leadership of subordinate education administrative departments and schools in the 1954-1955 academic year. The main method is to do well and strengthen inspection work. The content of the inspection should focus on checking the implementation of the Government Administration Council's "Instructions on Improving and Developing Secondary School Education," focusing on inspecting how to implement the work of all-round development education, as well as inspecting the on-the-job learning of teachers. The inspection method should focus on delving deeply into several different types of schools, discovering problems, and giving specific guidance. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中央人民政府教育部发出通知
    改进一九五四—一九五五年中学教育工作
    中央人民政府教育部最近发出“关于改进一九五四—一九五五学年度中学教育工作的通知”，要求各地教育行政部门认真贯彻中央人民政府政务院“关于改进和发展中学教育的指示”。
    通知说：为了正确贯彻中央人民政府政务院“关于改进和发展中学教育的指示”，把中学教育的质量切实提高一步，全国各省、市教育厅、局首先必须对提高中学领导干部和教师质量予以足够重视。
    对中学领导干部应当着重提高他们的政治理论、政策思想和教育理论水平。其办法可以采用开办现任校长、教导主任轮训班，有计划地轮训质量较低的校长、教导主任；由教育厅、局派主要负责干部分期分批组织校长、教导主任进行视察工作，从中提高他们的政策和业务水平；采用经验交流会、报告会和重大问题讨论会的方式，以及认真组织和领导校长、教导主任的在职学习等进行教育和提高。为了使他们能把主要力量放在领导教学工作上，还应切实减轻有些校长、教导主任过重的校外工作负担。在今后中学教育继续发展的情况下，中学领导干部还必须注意有计划地从学校内部培养和提拔，根据以往经验，培养的办法可以在提高现任校长、教导主任的各种训练组织、会议或其他活动中，吸收一部分可能培养为学校领导干部的教师参加；建立后备干部制度，一般中学都可根据条件增设副职，特别是条件较好的中学，应规定有培养中学领导干部的责任。
    关于加强教师政治、文化和业务学习问题，通知要求：在文化学习方面，各地教育行政部门应对现有教师进修学院，加强领导，改进教学工作，并根据可能条件予以扩充发展，尚未设立进修学院的省、市，应根据可能条件争取开办；已计划举办函授教育的省、市，应协助当地高等师范学校积极筹办，目前还无力量筹办的，依据可能条件采用东北师范大学所编语文、数学两科函授教材，组织部分教师进行学习，以便积累经验。这种函授学习，省、市教育厅、局应设专门机构或专职干部，担任行政领导和学习辅导工作，或根据可能条件由当地教师进修学院领导。在政治理论学习方面，目前各省、市可以按当地党委的统一布置，组织教师进行学习。在教育理论学习方面，根据各地各校的具体情况，可组织部分教师参加。在业务学习方面，可在加强教学组织领导的前提下，结合教材教法的研究，组织专题讲座、经验报告会、观摩教学、公开教学等方式进行。为了进一步做好新学年度工作，通知还要求各地教育行政部门有重点地总结过去几年中学领导干部和教师在实际工作中所积累的成功经验。
    通知认为省、市教育厅、局在一九五四—一九五五学年度中，还应当注意对所属教育行政部门和学校进行深入检查和加强具体领导。主要办法是作好并加强视察工作。视察内容应以检查对政务院“关于改进和发展中学教育的指示”的执行情况为中心，着重视察如何贯彻全面发展教育的工作，以及视察教师的在职学习情况。视察方法应当重点深入几种不同类型的学校，发现问题，给以具体指导。（新华社）
