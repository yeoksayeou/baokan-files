In early August, we set out from Altay, riding horses to ascend the Altai Mountains. The further west we went, the higher the mountains became. After traveling more than 300 *li*, we arrived at the summer pastures in the mountains. The Altai Mountains are picturesque everywhere. The hills are covered with green pines and white birches, clear springs flow in the valleys, and colorful wildflowers bloom on the boundless grasslands. In the wide valleys, every three to five *chi* along the banks of small streams, there are *aul* (settlements) of seven or eight or a dozen felt tents. Sheep and horses graze near the *aul*, and herdsmen ride their horses.

In the Toru Aty area, there are a dozen connected pastures with lush grass and water. Six tribes live here: Yisihas, Yiteli, Hazbieke, Batahara, Cheruqi, and Balhe, with more than 600 felt tents, more than 3,500 people, and more than 56,000 livestock. We visited many *aul*, and the enthusiastic Kazakh herdsmen warmly welcomed the guests, discussing the development of their livestock. The livestock of the six tribes of Yisihas, etc., had been plundered by the American imperialist armed spy Usman bandits. Before liberation, there were not many livestock, and many families did not have a single head. By 1952, the number of livestock in this area had only developed to more than 20,000, but this year it has increased to more than 56,000, and every family has livestock. The poor herdsmen have settled down and their lives are beginning to improve. Haliyula has been a herdboy since he was a child. In 1944, he had 15 livestock, but in that year he and many herdsmen were forced by the Usman bandits to the Jinghe area, and all his livestock was looted. In 1946, the national army of the Ili-Tacheng-Altay area drove the Usman bandits out of the Altai area, and Haliyula returned to his hometown. He and his wife carried their luggage and walked more than 1,000 *li*, almost starving to death on the road. After returning, they lived on the banks of the Ertix River, living by fishing and grinding the fruits and aquatic plants in the river into flour. After liberation, Haliyula worked as a day laborer at the Shaer Caohu pasture. In 1951, the people's government provided him with two *dou* of wheat seeds to plant dry land. In 1952 and 1953, the people's government successively provided him with 650,000 yuan, and in April this year, it provided his family with four ewes. When we went to visit him, Haliyula said, "The people's government is closer to me than my parents. Poor people like me have also settled down." Now, his family has 14 livestock of all sizes. We also visited many middle herdsmen's families, and every family's livestock has increased by about twice as much as in the early days of liberation. The economy of the herdowners has also developed. Habule Alide is a relatively large herdowner in this area. In 1944, he owned more than 1,700 sheep, but he was looted by the Usman bandits. In addition, due to poor management, he had only more than 500 sheep when he was liberated in 1949. Now it has increased to more than 1,200 sheep, 22 cattle, 18 horses and 7 camels. Because the pastoral area has implemented a policy that benefits both herdboys and herdowners, the herdboys' enthusiasm for production has increased. In the past few years, Habule Alide's livestock has not been eaten by wolves, frozen to death or lost.

With the development of production and trade cooperation, the lives of herdsmen have generally improved. Before liberation, four sheep could only be exchanged for one brick of tea, and ordinary herdsmen could only drink water boiled with weeds. Now one sheep can be exchanged for more than 20 bricks of tea, and every family can drink tea. In the past, herdsmen generally wore old sheepskins during the day and covered themselves with old sheepskins at night. Now, most of them wear corduroy clothes, women wear floral flannel gowns, and almost every family has a new quilt. In the past, herdsmen only ate milk and dried milk, but now they can eat *baursak* (a kind of fried dough and small biscuits) and milk noodles made of white flour, and sometimes they eat rice pilaf. In the past, hides, wool, and sheep intestines had no market. In addition to making leather clothes, boots, and felt, most of them were wasted. Now, herdsmen sell these animal products to the state, supporting the country's industrial construction and increasing their income. As the lives of the herdsmen improve, their enthusiasm for labor is even greater. Although it is August, they have begun to harvest winter grass under the advocacy of the people's government. The Altai grasslands are showing a thriving scene.

    在阿勒泰山草原
    新华社记者　关君放　夏格尔
    八月初，记者由阿勒泰出发，乘马西登阿勒泰山。越往西走，山势越高，行三百多里后，到了山中的夏季牧场。阿勒泰山处处风景如画。山岗上长满青松和白桦，山谷中流着清澈的泉水，无边的草原上开遍了各色野花，蔚蓝的天空浮着白云。在宽阔的山谷里，小溪两旁每隔三五尺，便有七八顶或十几顶毡帐篷的阿吾勒（居民点），阿吾勒附近牧放着羊群、马群，牧民们骑马驰骋。
    在托鲁阿提一带，有十几个牧场相连，水草丰美，这里居住着益斯哈斯、依铁里、哈兹别克、巴塔哈拉、切鲁齐、巴尔河等六个部落，共有六百多顶毡帐篷，三千五百多人，五万六千多头牲畜。记者访问了许多阿吾勒，热情的哈萨克牧民殷勤地招待着来客，谈述牲畜发展的情况。原来益斯哈斯等六个部落的牲畜，过去曾经被美帝国主义武装间谍乌斯满匪徒抢劫过，解放前牲畜不多，好多人家没有一头牲畜。到一九五二年，这一带的牲畜还只发展到二万多头，今年已增加到五万六千多头，家家都有牲畜了。穷苦的牧民们已经安家立业，生活开始上升。哈利尤拉从小就是牧工，一九四四年他有十五头牲畜，但这一年他和许多牧民被乌斯满匪徒逼到靖河一带，牲畜全部被抢光。一九四六年伊（犁）塔（城）阿（山）三区民族军把乌斯满匪徒赶出阿勒泰区，哈利尤拉才回到了故乡。他和妻子两人背上行李徒步一千多里，几乎饿死在路上，回来后住在额尔齐斯河畔，靠捕鱼、捞河中水草果实磨面为生，解放后，哈利尤拉到沙尔草胡牧场做零工。一九五一年人民政府救济他二斗麦种，种了旱田；一九五二年和一九五三年，人民政府先后救济他六十五万元，今年四月又救济他家四只母绵羊。当记者前去访问时，哈利尤拉说：“人民政府比我的父母还亲，我这样的穷人也安家立业了。”现在，他家已有大小牲畜十四头。记者还访问了许多中等牧民的家庭，家家牲畜都比解放初期增加了一倍上下。牧主的经济也有了发展。哈布勒阿立得是这一带较大的牧主，一九四四年就拥有一千七百多只羊，但遭到乌斯满匪徒的抢劫，加之经营不善，到一九四九年解放时只有五百多只羊，现在已增加到一千二百多只羊、二十二头牛、十八匹马和七峰骆驼。由于牧区实行了牧工、牧主两利的政策，牧工生产积极性提高，哈布勒阿立得的牲畜几年来再没有发生狼吃、冻死或丢失的事情了。
    随着生产和贸易合作事业的发展，牧民们的生活已普遍提高。解放前，这里四只羊才能换一块砖茶，一般牧民只能喝野草熬的水，现在一只羊换二十多块茶，家家都能喝茶了；以前牧民普遍是白天穿老羊皮，夜里盖老羊皮，现在大都穿上条绒衣服，妇女们穿上了花哔叽长衫，几乎家家都有了新被子；以前牧民吃的只是奶子和奶干，现在他们都能吃到白面做的保尔沙克（一种油煎的面片和小面饼）和奶子面条，有时还吃大米抓饭；以前皮张、羊毛、羊肠没有销路，除了做皮衣、靴和毡子之外，大都被糟蹋，现在牧民们把这些畜产品卖给国家，支援了国家的工业建设，又增加了自己的收入。牧民们生活上升，劳动的劲头更大了，现在虽然是八月，但是他们在人民政府的倡导下已开始割收冬草了。阿勒泰草原呈现一片欣欣向荣的景象。
