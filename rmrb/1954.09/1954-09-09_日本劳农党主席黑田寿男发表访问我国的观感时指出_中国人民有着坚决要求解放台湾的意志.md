Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 8th: According to Hong Kong newspapers, Kuroda Hisao, Chairman of the Japanese Labor-Farmer Party and member of the Japanese House of Representatives, expressed his impressions of visiting China to the press in Hong Kong on the 5th, stating that he believes the Chinese people have a firm will to liberate Taiwan. The Japanese parliamentarian, who recently spent about a month visiting China, said, "Very naturally, whether from a political or economic point of view, Taiwan should be part of China." He pointed out: "The rule of the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan is actually just the rule of the United States. The U.S. occupation of Taiwan is an unreasonable thing that goes against history." Kuroda Hisao also said: "Taiwan will eventually be liberated, and the people of New China actually have the power to liberate Taiwan. The current situation of Taiwan being controlled by the United States will not be able to last long."

Kuroda Hisao praised China's policy of using consultation to solve all international problems, respecting the sovereignty of other countries, and handling relations with other countries based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit. He said: "The problem that China and Japan cannot establish normal relations does not lie with China, but with Japan. The Japanese government supports the Chiang Kai-shek clique, provides the United States with military bases, and engages in the revival of militarism and rearmament. These all hinder the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations." Kuroda Hisao believes that "only by opposing this militarist policy and implementing a policy of peace is it possible to restore normal Sino-Japanese relations."

Kuroda Hisao also advocated lifting the "embargo" and all restrictions imposed by the Japanese government that hinder the normal development of Sino-Japanese trade.

    日本劳农党主席黑田寿男发表访问我国的观感时指出
    中国人民有着坚决要求解放台湾的意志
     【新华社广州八日电】据香港报纸消息：日本劳农党主席、日本众议院议员黑田寿男五日在香港向报界发表访问中国的观感时表示，他认为中国人民有着坚决要求解放台湾的意志。这位最近在中国作了约一个月的访问的日本议员说：“非常自然地，无论从政治上或者从经济上来说，台湾应该成为中国的一部分”。他指出：“蒋介石集团在台湾的统治，其实只是美国的统治而已。美国占领台湾是一件违背历史的不合理的事情”。黑田寿男还说：“台湾终于是要解放的，新中国人民实际上具有解放台湾的力量。台湾被美国控制的现状将不能长久维持下去。”
    黑田寿男赞扬中国用协商方法来解决一切国际问题，并且尊重别国的主权，用平等互利原则来处理与别国的关系的政策。他说：“中日两国不能建立正常关系，问题不是在中国而是在于日本这方面。日本政府支持蒋介石集团，供给美国以军事基地，进行复活军国主义和重整军备，这些都阻碍了中日关系的正常化。”黑田寿男认为，“只有反对这种军国主义政策，实行和平政策，才是恢复中日正常关系的唯一道路。”
    黑田寿男并主张解除“禁运”和日本政府执行的阻碍中日贸易正常发展的一切限制。
