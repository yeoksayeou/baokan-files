Xinhua News Agency, September 1st—The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government convened the 1954 Expanded Overseas Chinese Affairs Conference in Beijing from July 8th to 14th, and solemnly elected He Xiangning, Chen Jiageng, Peng Zemin, Liao Chengzhi, Fang Junzhuang, Guan Wensen, Hong Sisi, Zhuang Xiquan, Zhuang Mingli, Zhou Zheng, Qiu Ji, Yi Meihou, Su Zhenshou, Li Huanqun, Wu Yixiu, Zhang Guoji, Ye Yidong, Zhang Yi, Liao Sheng, Xu Simin, Situ Meitang, Chen Qiyuan, Wu Chan, Huang Changshui, Li Hexing, Ma Yusheng, Xie Yingrui, Kang Mingqiu, Li Guangchen, and Deng Junkai as thirty representatives to the National People's Congress.

The process of generating these thirty representatives demonstrates the democracy of the election. The 1953 Overseas Chinese Affairs Conference conducted preliminary deliberations on the issue of electing representatives to the National People's Congress from overseas Chinese. Entrusted by the expanded conference, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, based on different situations, used different methods to conduct extensive consultations on the generation of representative candidates: in people's democratic countries and certain capitalist countries, candidates were nominated through meetings held by overseas Chinese organizations; in certain capitalist countries that have established diplomatic relations with our country, candidates were jointly proposed by relevant parties after separately inviting representative individuals from various strata and organizations for consultation. Overseas Chinese compatriots in other areas with special circumstances, in addition to expressing their infinite gratitude, hoped to nominate representative individuals from among the returned overseas Chinese in the region who are already in the country as representative candidates. The thirty candidates for representatives to the National People's Congress from overseas Chinese were proposed on the basis of such full consultation. Liao Chengzhi, Deputy Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, said in the "Report on Consulting and Generating Candidates for Overseas Chinese Representatives to the National People's Congress": these thirty candidates "can only be proposed based on the current actual situation of overseas Chinese, taking into account the principles of region, class, and province of origin, from individuals with greater representativeness overseas who may return to China, and returned overseas Chinese who still have representativeness overseas."

All the representatives attending the 1954 Expanded Overseas Chinese Affairs Conference, with a high sense of responsibility to the people, conducted repeated discussions on these thirty representative candidates and unanimously believed that adopting the methods of consultation, deliberation, and discussion to generate representative candidates, taking into account the special circumstances of overseas Chinese, is practical and completely correct; the thirty candidates proposed on the basis of democratic consultation have broad representativeness and are satisfactory and necessary to everyone. On July 14th, all the representatives conducted the election by secret ballot, and all thirty representative candidates were elected as representatives to the National People's Congress.

During the conference, all the representatives conscientiously discussed the opening speech by He Xiangning, Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, and the "Report on Overseas Chinese Affairs Work in the Past Six Months" by Deputy Director Zhuang Xiquan. The representatives unanimously agreed with the instructions of Director He Xiangning in her opening speech; and approved the "Report on Overseas Chinese Affairs Work in the Past Six Months," believing that the overseas Chinese affairs work in the past six months has been successful, especially in mobilizing and organizing family members of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese to participate in agricultural and handicraft production, the achievements are particularly significant. In the discussion, the representatives also raised criticisms and constructive suggestions on the overseas Chinese affairs work in the past six months.

Discussing the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China was also one of the main agenda items of the conference. The representatives spoke enthusiastically at the meeting. They all expressed their heartfelt support for the draft Constitution, believing that the draft Constitution reflects the wishes and fundamental interests of overseas Chinese, embodies the motherland's concern for overseas Chinese, and unanimously passed the "Resolution on Supporting the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China."

The conference finally passed a telegram of tribute to Chairman Mao and concluded on July 14th after a closing speech by Li Tiemin, Deputy Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government.

The representatives attending this expanded overseas Chinese affairs conference included responsible persons from central and regional overseas Chinese affairs agencies and well-known overseas Chinese figures: He Xiangning, Liao Chengzhi, Li Tiemin, Zhuang Xiquan, Situ Meitang, Peng Zemin, Cai Tingkai, Chen Qiyuan, Shao Lizi, Lian Guan, Hu Yuzhi, Huang Changshui, Wang Renshu, Yi Meihou, Fei Zhendong, Zhuang Mingli, Hong Sisi, Fang Junzhuang, Zhou Zheng, Huang Fukang, Wang Yanzhi, Zhan Wenhua, Li Wuxiang, Wu Tian, Hu Yisheng, Lu Cheng, Shen Zijiu, Zhao Feng, Wang Jinding, Hu Weifu, Huang Shi'an, Zhang Chukun, Wu Shengyu, Chen Zhenchun, Chen Rujiu, Fang Tu, Wang Tingjun, Yan Xiyue, Lin Bangfeng, Xu Yuanxiong, Qiu Bingjing, Qiu Xinying, Cai Yanxiong, Fu Fengshan, Wu Zhizhi, Huang Sheng, Liu Shuhua, Huang Guangcheng, Wang Jiyuan, Wang Yuanxing, Huang Jie, Lin Caizhi, Gao Yurong, Yang Xinrong, Guo Ruiren, Ye Yunjiao, Yan Zijun, Huang Ziheng, Chen Wenbin, Wei Zhengming, Chen Dingmao, Yang Chunsong, Chen Shuicheng, Yang Zhangxi, Chen Xingbang, Qiu Qinjing, Chen Yishi, Yang Tangcheng, Chen Bomou, Wu Degan, Lin Xindeng, Xu Zhimeng, Wu Yan'yin, Chen Qushui, Cai Yanji, Yang Wei, Zhao Zupei, Qiu Haitao, Chang Renxia, Wu Juetian, Fang Fuer, Kuang Xiuping, Huang Jinhai, Chen Houfu, and others, totaling one hundred and ninety-five people.

    华侨事务委员会举行侨务扩大会议
    选出全国人民代表大会代表卅名
    【新华社一日讯】中央人民政府华侨事务委员会七月八日到十四日在北京召开一九五四年侨务扩大会议，庄严地选出何香凝、陈嘉庚、彭泽民、廖承志、方君壮、官文森、洪丝丝、庄希泉、庄明理、周铮、邱及、蚁美厚、苏振寿、李唤群、吴益修、张国基、叶贻东、张翼、廖胜、徐四民、司徒美堂、陈其瑗、伍禅、黄长水、黎和兴、马玉声、谢应瑞、康鸣球、李广臣、邓军凯等三十人为全国人民代表大会代表。
    这三十名代表产生的过程说明了选举的民主性。一九五三年度侨务扩大会议曾就产生国外华侨应选全国人民代表大会代表的问题作了初步酝酿。中央人民政府华侨事务委员会受扩大会议的委托，根据不同情况，以不同方式，对代表候选人的产生，进行了广泛的协商：在人民民主国家和某些资本主义国家，候选人是经过侨团举行会议推选的；在某些和我国建立外交关系的资本主义国家，候选人是由有关方面分别邀请各阶层、各社团中具有代表性的人士进行协商后一致提出的。另一些情况特殊的地区的我国侨胞，除了表示无限感奋之外，希望就在这个地区已在国内的归侨中推选有代表性的人士作为代表候选人。国外华侨应选全国人民代表大会代表的三十名候选人，就是在这样充分协商的基础上提出的。中央人民政府华侨事务委员会副主任委员廖承志在“关于协商产生全国人民代表大会华侨代表人选的报告”中说：这三十名候选人，
  “只能根据从目前国外华侨的实际情况出发，照顾地区、阶层、省籍的原则，由在国外有较大的代表性、而又可能回国的人物，和虽已回国但在国外仍有代表性的归侨人士中提出”。
    出席一九五四年侨务扩大会议的全体代表，以高度对人民负责的精神，对这三十名代表候选人，进行了反复的讨论，一致认为照顾华侨特殊情况，采取协商、酝酿、讨论的办法产生代表候选人，是切合实际的，完全正确的；在民主协商基础上提出的三十名候选人具有广泛代表性，是大家认为满意和必要的。七月十四日，全体代表以无记名投票方式进行选举，三十名代表候选人全部当选为全国人民代表大会代表。
    会议期间，全体代表认真地讨论了中央人民政府华侨事务委员会主任委员何香凝的开幕词和副主任委员庄希泉的“半年来侨务工作的报告”。代表们一致同意何香凝主任委员在开幕词中的指示；并批准了“半年来侨务工作的报告”，认为半年来的侨务工作是有成绩的，特别是在动员和组织侨眷、归侨参加农业和手工业生产方面，成绩尤其显著。代表们在讨论中，还对半年来的侨务工作提出了批评和积极性的建议。
    讨论中华人民共和国宪法草案也是会议的主要议程之一。代表们在会上普遍热烈地发言。他们对宪法草案都表示衷心拥护，认为宪法草案反映了华侨的愿望和根本利益，体现了祖国对国外华侨的关怀，一致通过了“关于拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案的决议”。
    会议最后通过了向毛主席致敬电，并在七月十四日，由中央人民政府华侨事务委员会副主任委员李铁民致闭幕词后宣告结束。
    出席这次侨务扩大会议代表，有中央和各地区侨务机关负责人以及国外华侨著名人士：何香凝、廖承志、李铁民、庄希泉、司徒美堂、彭泽民、蔡廷锴、陈其瑗、邵力子、连贯、胡愈之、黄长水、王任叔、蚁美厚、费振东、庄明理、洪丝丝、方君壮、周铮、黄复康、王炎之、粘文华、李五香、吴天、胡一声、卢成、沈兹九、赵沨、汪金丁、胡伟夫、黄适安、张楚琨、吴盛育、陈振春、陈如旧、方图、王廷俊、颜西岳、林邦凤、许元雄、邱秉经、邱心婴、蔡演雄、符凤山、伍治之、黄声、刘树华、黄光成、王纪元、王源兴、黄洁、林采之、高玉荣、杨新容、郭瑞人、叶运蕉、颜子俊、黄子衡、陈文彬、魏正明、陈丁茂、杨春松、陈水成、杨章熹、陈兴邦、丘廑竞、陈倚石、杨汤城、陈伯谋、吴德淦、林鑫登、许志猛、吴研因、陈曲水、蔡衍吉、杨维、赵祖培、邱海涛、常任侠、伍觉天、方富尔、邝修屏、黄金海、陈厚父等一百九十五人。
