The task of the institute is to cultivate senior foreign trade personnel who possess a certain level of Marxism-Leninism and foreign trade policy, can independently master foreign trade business techniques, and are good at applying a foreign language. The institute currently has four departments and nine specialties, including Foreign Trade Economics, Russian, Western Languages, and Oriental Languages.
