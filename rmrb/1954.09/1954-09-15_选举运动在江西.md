Election Campaign in Jiangxi

By our reporter Sun Zunian

More than two-thirds of Jiangxi Province was the old revolutionary base area during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, and many places had established democratic regimes elected by the people. This left a deep impression on the people. On the eve of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, it is very meaningful for us to understand how the people of Jiangxi, who are rich in revolutionary tradition, elect people's representatives and participate in the management of state affairs in the democratic construction movement in the five years since liberation. With this in mind, I visited Shao Shiping, a deputy to the National People's Congress and Chairman of the People's Government of Jiangxi Province. I met him in a small office. Chairman Shao told me the following story with a smile:

In the early days of Jiangxi's liberation in 1949, in order to concentrate our efforts on eliminating the remnants of the Kuomintang bandit gangs in the province, it was beneficial to utilize the original Bao and Jia heads for a short period of time to support the People's Liberation War. Not long after, several peasant representatives from the old revolutionary base area of northeastern Jiangxi came to Nanchang and went directly to Chairman Shao Shiping's office to question him:

"Sixteen years ago, under the leadership of the Communist Party, you and martyr Fang Zhimin led us in revolutionary struggles. At that time, all Soviet governments were elected by ourselves. Today, we are liberated, and under the leadership of the Communist Party, and under your leadership, why do we still need Bao and Jia heads to manage us? Why not let us elect our own representatives to handle our own affairs?" After listening to their opinions, Chairman Shao Shiping said to these peasant representatives: "The question you raised is very correct! The people should be the masters of their own affairs." He patiently explained: "Our governments at all levels are elected by the people, and people's congresses are held at each level to elect township heads, county heads, government committee members, etc., and to review government work and determine work tasks. Precisely in order to better achieve this goal, we must now deeply mobilize the masses, establish peasant association organizations, and rely on these organizations to thoroughly smash the Bao-Jia system of the Kuomintang reactionaries that directly oppress the people, then gradually establish grassroots people's democratic regimes on the basis of the peasant associations, and then enter the people's congress system elected by the people through universal suffrage. The People's Congress system is the basic system for our country to implement the people's democratic dictatorship. You should quickly mobilize poor and hired peasants, pay attention to uniting middle peasants, and organize peasant associations!" These peasant representatives were extremely excited after hearing Chairman Shao Shiping's words.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the vast rural areas of Jiangxi Province, especially the old revolutionary base areas, successively convened people's representative conferences elected by the people on the basis of peasant associations, and began to exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress, electing township people's governments. The six cities, eighty-two counties, and one special district in the province also successively convened people's representative conferences at all levels. This not only enhanced the political consciousness of the broad masses of the people, but also accumulated new experiences in democratic elections, and at the same time became familiar with and understood the representative figures among the people in various tasks. Therefore, the method of generating representatives for the people's representative conferences at all levels gradually transitioned from nomination and invitation to direct and indirect elections by the people. By 1952, people's representative conferences in all cities and counties except for nine counties had successively exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress, electing government committees, consultative committees, and standing committees. From June 1953 to March 1954, according to the "Resolution on Convening the National People's Congress and People's Congresses at All Levels" of the Central People's Government Committee, the province successfully completed the primary-level elections in 9,788 townships, towns, urban districts, and cities without districts. On the basis of completing primary-level elections, cities, counties, and the Lushan Special District all successively convened people's congresses.

The broad masses of the people in Jiangxi Province attach great importance to their right to vote. During the primary-level election campaign, the average voter turnout in the province reached 86.6 percent of the total number of voters. The proportion was even higher in the old revolutionary base areas, such as Ruijin County, which averaged 92.7 percent, and the Jinggang Mountains area, which averaged 99.8 percent. It is not difficult to understand why the people cherish their right to vote so much. This can be specifically answered by the situation in Qinghu Township, Hengfeng County. This township was one of the locations of the Soviet organs of the Fujian-Zhejiang-Jiangxi Province during the land revolution. The people here have undergone long-term revolutionary baptism, and possess unlimited revolutionary power and strong democratic demands. Therefore, when the good news of the primary-level elections spread here, people expressed joy and happiness. Many people recalled the democratic life during the Red regime. At that time, candidates for representatives were first nominated by mass organizations, and after repeated discussions and comparisons by voters, the best people were selected from among the good ones. The election method used "bean voting" and other democratic methods. Such a good life was strangled by the Kuomintang reactionaries after the Red Army went north to resist Japan. During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, people could not see the shadow of democracy. Although there were "elections" at that time, the officials "circled" by Chiang Kai-shek rode on the heads of the people, and the people did not dare to speak. People described the elections at that time as: after each election, the people suffered a "election disaster." During the days of suffering disasters, the people here did not succumb to the reactionaries. They fought against the reactionaries on the one hand, and also pinned their hopes on the victorious return of the Red Army. The people of Qinghu Township were not disappointed, and now the people have regained their democratic rights.

During the primary-level election campaign, a total of 189,382 people's representatives were elected in the province, of whom women representatives accounted for 18.18 percent.

The people of Jiangxi Province understand that the people's representatives who make up the People's Congress, the organ of power, their decisions and their opinions are related to the future lives of the people. The people consider the qualifications of representatives from all aspects, and the "socialist pathfinder" is the main criterion for the broad masses of the people to select representatives. Many Communist Party members and well-known model workers in industry and agriculture were elected as representatives with the highest number of votes. Many grassroots cadres who are active in their work, have a correct style, and faithfully serve the people have also been elected as representatives by the people. Some grassroots cadres with shortcomings sincerely reviewed their shortcomings to the people during this great election campaign, and were still able to gain the understanding and trust of the masses. Only a small number of people who seriously violated laws and regulations were defeated in the election campaign. The number of original grassroots cadres in the province who were elected as representatives to the township people's congresses reached 82.77 percent. This figure proves that the vast majority of grassroots cadres in Jiangxi Province are wholeheartedly serving the people and are trusted by the people.

The people's representative conferences and people's congresses at all levels in Jiangxi Province, which exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress, were also very cautious about electing government committees. At the first people's representative conference of all circles in Leping County last year, which exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress, the representatives of the ninth district proposed Cheng Zhengxu, who worked in the old Soviet area, as a candidate for deputy county head. Some representatives, however, believed that Cheng Zhengxu was too old and feared that his ability would not be strong, so it would be better to elect Director Yang, who was both young and had a good style. The two sides could not agree, so they specially sent representatives to Cheng Zhengxu's hometown to conduct an investigation. The result of the investigation was: Cheng Zhengxu led the revolutionary work of the entire county during the Soviet period; after the Red Army went north, he was imprisoned five times and suffered all kinds of hardships; after he came out, he had been participating in labor at home and often promoted the benefits of the Communist Party to the masses; now he is the chairman of the peasant association and his work performance is good. As a result, everyone unanimously elected Cheng Zhengxu as deputy county head.

In the past five years, the people of Jiangxi Province have exercised their democratic rights in this way, electing their own representatives and forming their own government, and under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, they are moving forward confidently towards a socialist society.

    选举运动在江西
    本报记者  孙祖年
    江西全省三分之二以上的地区，是第二次国内革命战争时期的老革命根据地，很多地方都曾建立过由人民用选举方法产生的民主政权。这在人民中留下了深刻的印象。在建国五周年的前夕，我们能够了解富有革命传统的江西人民在解放五年来的民主建政运动中，如何选举人民代表，如何参加国家事务的管理，是非常有意义的事情。我就是怀着这样的心情访问了全国人民代表大会代表、江西省人民政府主席邵式平。在一间不太大的办公室里我会见了他。邵主席笑着对我讲了下面的故事——
    一九四九年江西解放初期，那时为了集中力量消灭省内国民党残余匪帮，很短时期得利用原有的保甲长，这对支援人民解放战争是有利的。不久，赣东北老革命根据地有几个农民代表来到了南昌，直接找到邵式平主席的办公室，提出质问说：
  “十六年以前，赣东北地区在共产党领导下，你和方志敏烈士带领我们进行过革命斗争，那时一切苏维埃政府都是我们自己选举出来的。今天解放了，又是在共产党的领导下，全省人民又在你的带领下，为什么还要保、甲长来管我们呢？为什么不让我们选举自己的代表办理自己的事情？”邵式平主席听完了他们的意见以后，向这几位农民代表说：“你们的问题提得很对！人民是应该当家作主的。”并耐心地解释说：“我们的各级政府，都是由人民选举产生，逐级召开人民代表大会会议，选举乡长、县长、政府委员等等，并审查政府工作，确定工作任务。正是为了更好地达到这个目的，现在就要深入发动群众，建立农民协会组织，并依靠这个组织彻底粉碎国民党反动派直接压迫人民的保甲制度，然后在农民协会的基础上，逐步建立人民民主基层政权，再进入由人民普选的人民代表大会制度。人民代表大会制度是我们国家实行人民民主专政的基本制度。你们赶快去发动雇贫农，并注意团结中农，组织农民协会吧！”这几位农民代表听了邵式平主席这一番话，都兴奋极了。
    在中华人民共和国成立之后，江西省广大农村特别是老革命根据地，陆续以农民协会为基础，召开了由人民选举的人民代表会议，并开始代行人民代表大会职权，选举了乡人民政府。全省六市、八十二县、一个特别区也先后召开了各级各界人民代表会议。这不但提高了广大人民的政治觉悟，更积累了民主选举的新经验，同时并在各项工作中也熟悉和了解了人民中间的代表人物。因而各界人民代表会议的代表产生方法，由推选和邀请逐步过渡到由人民直接和间接的选举。到一九五二年，全省除九个县以外，各市、县的人民代表会议都先后代行了人民代表大会的职权，选举了政府委员会、协商委员会和常务委员会。一九五三年六月到一九五四年三月，根据中央人民政府委员会“关于召开全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会的决议”，全省胜利完成了九千七百八十八个乡、镇、市辖区和不辖区的市的基层选举。在完成基层选举的基础上，各市、县和庐山特别区均先后召开了人民代表大会会议。
    江西省广大人民十分重视自己的选举权利。在基层选举运动中，全省参加选举的选民，平均达到选民总数的百分之八十六点六。各老革命根据地的比例更高，如瑞金县平均达百分之九十二点七，井冈山区平均达百分之九十九点八。人民这样珍视自己的选举权利是不难理解的。这可以从横峰县清湖乡的情况得到具体的解答。这个乡是土地革命时期闽浙赣省苏维埃机关驻地之一。这里的人民经过长期的革命洗礼，蕴藏着无限的革命动力和强烈的民主要求。所以，当基层选举的喜讯传到这里以后，人们都流露出欢欣愉快的心情。不少人曾回忆到红色政权时期的民主生活。那时选举代表也是先由群众团体提出候选人，经过选民反复讨论评比，在好的当中挑选最好的人。选举的方法用过“豆选”，也用过其他的民主方式。这样美好的日子在红军北上抗日以后，就被国民党反动派扼杀了。国民党反动派统治时代，人们看不到民主的影子。虽然当时也有过“选举”，但是蒋介石“圈”出来的官儿骑在人民的头上，人民都不敢说话。人民形容那时的选举是：经过一次选举，人民遭受一次“选灾”。在遭受灾难的日子里，这里的人民并没有向反动派屈服。他们一面向反动派进行斗争，同时也把希望寄托在红军的胜利归来。清湖乡人民并没有失望，现在人民重新获得了民主权利。
    在基层选举运动中，全省共选出人民代表十八万九千三百八十二人，其中妇女代表占百分之十八点一八。
    江西省人民懂得，组成人民代表大会这个权力机关的人民代表，他们的决策，他们的意见，关系人民的未来的生活，人民从各个方面来考虑代表的条件，而“社会主义带路人”则是广大群众挑选代表的主要标准。许多共产党员和著名的工农业劳动模范都以最高的选票当选为代表。许多工作积极、作风正派、忠实为人民服务的基层干部也都被人民选为代表。有些有缺点的基层干部，在这个伟大的选举运动中，对于自己的缺点向人民进行了诚恳的检讨，仍然能够获得群众的谅解和信任。只有少数严重违法乱纪的分子在选举运动中都落选了。全省原有基层干部当选为乡人民代表大会代表的达百分之八十二点七七，这个数字证明江西省绝大多数的基层干部都是忠心耿耿为人民服务，并为人民所信任的。
    江西省各级代行人民代表大会职权的人民代表会议和人民代表大会，对于选举政府委员会也是十分慎重。乐平县去年第一次代行人民代表大会职权的各界人民代表会议上，第九区的代表曾提出当年在老苏区工作的程正旭为副县长候选人。有的代表却认为程正旭年纪大了，怕他能力不强，不如选既年青、作风又好的杨科长。双方争论不下，最后专门派代表去程正旭的家乡作了调查。调查的结果是：程正旭在苏维埃时期领导过全县的革命工作；红军北上后，他坐了五次牢，吃尽了苦；出来后一直在家参加劳动，并经常向群众宣传共产党的好处；现在是农民协会主席，工作表现不错。结果大家一致选举程正旭为副县长。
    江西省人民五年来就是这样行使了民主权利，选举了自己的代表并组成自己的政府，并在共产党和人民政府的领导下，充满信心地朝向社会主义社会奋勇迈进。
