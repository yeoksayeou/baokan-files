To welcome the convocation of the National People's Congress meeting, tens of thousands of workers at Anshan Iron and Steel (Angang) participating in production and construction are achieving new accomplishments with great enthusiasm. In the Iron Smelting Plant where National People's Congress representative Meng Tai works, following the No. 7 blast furnace’s creation of the highest daily output record, the No. 8 blast furnace also created a highest daily output record on August 30th, exceeding the state plan by 26 percent, all of which was first-grade iron. In the small rolling mill where National People's Congress representative Zhang Mingshan works, after completing the August task, a production technology representative meeting is now being held to prepare for trial use of a new anti-circumferential disk to roll new products as a gift to the National People's Congress meeting. The workers of the Blast Furnace Engineering Company where National People's Congress representative Hu Zhaosen works, while striving to complete the construction of China's third automated blast furnace ahead of schedule, have begun preparations to continue the construction of China's fourth and fifth automated blast furnaces. In other production plants, mines and construction sites, the workers' spirits are also a hundredfold higher. The workers of the steelmaking plant, in discussing the September production plan, in order to welcome the convocation of the National People's Congress meeting and to welcome China's National Day this year, the Class B steelmaking workers have proposed a plan to produce 20 heats of rapid steelmaking per month. On the afternoon of September 3, workers Shang Kui, Tan Guochou, and others at the primary rolling mill rolled 41 steel billets in one hour, setting the highest hourly record for the plant since its resumption of production in 1948. Workers at the large rolling mill, which is rolling heavy rails in large quantities, successfully trial-rolled a new specification of mold steel on September 1.
