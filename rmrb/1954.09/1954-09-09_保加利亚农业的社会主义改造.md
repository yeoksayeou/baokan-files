The Socialist Transformation of Bulgarian Agriculture
Petko Kirilev, Master of Economics, Sofia Dimitrov Agricultural Academy

September 9th marks the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of Bulgaria. The democratic regime, based on the worker-peasant alliance, was established as a result of the September 9th People's Uprising. This uprising broke out during the defeat of Nazi Germany and achieved victory thanks to the decisive assistance of the Soviet army.

With the establishment of the People's Democratic regime, Bulgaria entered a stage of socialist transformation. After the nationalization of capitalist industrial concerns and banks, land reform, and other democratic reforms, our people faced the main task of laying the foundation for a socialist society.

Our people's great leader and teacher, Georgi Dimitrov, declared at the Fifth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party: The policy of establishing a socialist economic base in our country is the general line of the Bulgarian Communist Party. This policy is embodied in our people's first Five-Year Plan (1949-1953), which was completed one year ahead of schedule.

The basic task of establishing a socialist economic base in Bulgaria is to implement socialist industrialization. This requires an agriculture adapted to a large-scale socialist economy and demands the socialist transformation of agriculture.

Lenin's great agricultural cooperation plan, the key to the socialist transformation of agriculture, is the foundation of the Bulgarian Communist Party's agricultural policy. Under the guidance of this policy and the experience of the Soviet Communist Party in agricultural collectivization, the Bulgarian Communist Party leads the working peasants to carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture through the path of cooperation.

The Bulgarian Communist Party follows Lenin's principles of the agricultural cooperation plan to lead the socialist transformation of agriculture. Its agricultural policy is guided by Lenin's strategic slogan: "Rely firmly on the poor peasants, consolidate the alliance with the middle peasants, and resolutely oppose the rich peasants."

The aim of the alliance between the working class and the working peasants is to limit the exploitation of the rich peasants and attract the working peasants to participate in socialist construction.

Limiting the exploitation of rich peasants is achieved through methods such as compulsory purchase of large agricultural machinery, land reform, and nationalization of rural industrial enterprises. For this purpose, various measures were taken: rich peasants were not allowed to join agricultural production cooperatives, and the government implemented class-differentiated treatment in taxation policies, credit, and the purchase of agricultural products.

Shortly after Bulgaria's liberation, Dimitrov pointed out that, under our country's conditions, agricultural production cooperatives are the most appropriate form of socialist agriculture. In the early years after the establishment of the People's Democratic regime, more than a thousand agricultural production cooperatives were established under the leadership of the Communist Party.

In 1949, the first year of the Five-Year Plan, industrial production exceeded that of 1948 by 29.5 percent. In 1950, industrial production was more than three times higher than the 1939 level. During the same period, agricultural production had only just exceeded the 1939 level. The development of socialist industry was extremely rapid, but the development of agriculture was unsatisfactory.

After land reform, small-scale individual farming predominated on a larger scale. This made it impossible to carry out expanded reproduction, meet the needs of the rapidly growing socialist industry for raw materials, satisfy the supply needs of cities and the army, and the needs of state reserves.

The phenomenon of agriculture lagging behind the rapidly growing industry hindered the development of the entire national economy. Vulko Chervenkov, Chairman of the Bulgarian Council of Ministers, pointed out in April 1950: "Our further development depends on making every effort to organize agriculture in a socialist manner and transform it into a large-scale economy."

On the other hand, small-scale individual agriculture also bred capitalism.

These two shortcomings of small-scale agricultural production became more prominent in 1950, when socialist industrialization had already made great progress. Therefore, as our country further implemented socialist industrialization, the issue of the socialist transformation of agriculture became an urgent problem to be solved.

Our leader and teacher, Dimitrov, pointed out that the People's Democratic system and socialism cannot be built on the basis of large-scale socialist industry and small agriculture. While carrying out socialist construction and developing industry, agriculture must be transformed into socialist agriculture through agricultural production cooperatives and agricultural machine and tractor stations.

After Bulgaria's liberation, our Communist Party, based on the theories of Lenin and Stalin on the socialist transformation of agriculture, implemented a policy of preparing conditions for the rapid development of agricultural cooperatives.

As early as the beginning of 1950, some conditions for implementing agricultural cooperation already existed, and some other conditions were maturing.

The People's Democratic system – a special form of the dictatorship of the proletariat – had been firmly established. The main means of production in industry and transportation, as well as agricultural machinery, were concentrated in the hands of the state. The agricultural production cooperatives that had been established had demonstrated in practice the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives over small-scale individual agriculture. The purchase of agricultural products and the supply of consumer goods to peasants were almost entirely controlled by the state and consumer cooperatives.

The prerequisite for carrying out the socialist transformation of agriculture – a sufficient technological foundation – was in place. Our country's rapidly developing industry and the assistance of the powerful Soviet socialist industry ensured the supply of all necessary agricultural machinery to our agriculture, which was in the process of socialist transformation. The assistance of the great Soviet Union was a favorable condition for our country to carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture.

However, a large proportion of our peasants have not yet realized the superiority of agricultural cooperation, so "the whole question is to convince the peasants of the superiority of agricultural production cooperation." (Vulko Chervenkov)

In the first half of 1950, the Bulgarian Communist Party conducted extensive propaganda, organizational, and educational work among the working peasants. In a convincing manner, they pointed out to them the remarkable achievements and irrefutable superiority of the Soviet collective farms and our agricultural production cooperatives.

The Second National Congress of Agricultural Production Cooperatives, held in April 1950, discussed important issues related to agricultural production cooperatives and adopted the model charter of agricultural production cooperatives, which had previously been discussed nationwide. This meeting played an important role in making the working peasants aware of the superiority of collective management.

The policy of economically restricting the rich peasants had been effective. The strict sanctions of the People's Democratic laws against rich peasants who frequently violated government decrees isolated the rich peasants among the masses of working peasants and promoted the poor and middle peasants to embark on the road of agricultural production cooperation. This is why, in the second half of 1950, the majority of working peasants increasingly recognized the superiority of agricultural cooperation and joined cooperatives in large numbers. Many middle peasants also voluntarily joined agricultural production cooperatives.

In January 1950, there were 1,600 agricultural production cooperatives, with participating farm households accounting for 14.2 percent of the national total and cultivated land accounting for 11.2 percent of the national total. By the end of 1950, the number of agricultural production cooperatives had increased to 2,589, uniting 47.9 percent of the nation's farm households and owning 44.5 percent of the cultivated land.

By the end of 1952, our country had 2,747 agricultural production cooperatives – including 52.3 percent of the nation's farm households and 60.5 percent of the cultivated land.

This is a great historical victory in the socialist transformation of our agriculture. "Such a revolutionary change is equivalent to the achievement of our second September 9th." (Vulko Chervenkov)

Guided by the theories of Lenin and Stalin on the socialist transformation of agriculture, the Bulgarian Communist Party attaches great importance to the special significance of machine and tractor stations and their role in establishing and consolidating the socialist system in the countryside; they are the method of combining socialist industry and agriculture. Machine tractor stations are the pillars of the Party and the government in transforming agriculture and educating working peasants in the socialist spirit.

This year, our agriculture has 149 agricultural machine and tractor stations. Approximately 15,000 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower), 1,800 grain harvesting combines, and thousands of other types of agricultural machinery are working on our country's vast land.

The mechanization of field work has reached 48.6 percent in 1954. Last year, Soviet-made grain harvesting combines harvested more than 23 percent of the wheat fields.

Modern agronomic methods and complex agricultural techniques have become part of agriculture. Agricultural production and livestock breeding rates are constantly increasing. In 1953, cooperative farmers obtained higher yields than individual farmers. For example: wheat harvest was 21.7 percent higher, corn - 18.5 percent higher, sunflower seeds - 30.2 percent higher, cotton - 32 percent higher, etc.

Agricultural production cooperatives and machine tractor stations have solved the grain problem. In the past three or four years, grain production has increased by one-third compared to the pre-war year of 1939. Two-thirds of the grain purchased by the state comes from the socialist sector of agriculture. The sown area of ​​technical crops has doubled. Vegetable, grape, and fruit growing industries are developing rapidly.

The basic task of the current stage of the socialist transformation of our agriculture is to consolidate agricultural production cooperatives organizationally, economically, and politically. The Party and the government have issued many important documents, proposing to make the consolidation of agricultural production cooperatives organizationally, economically, and politically an important task.

Our country's agricultural production cooperatives have adhered to the basic regulations of cooperative life - the model charter - and resolutely implemented the decisions of the Party and the government, thus achieving remarkable achievements in economic, political, and organizational consolidation.

Agricultural production cooperatives have laid a solid foundation for the happy life of their members. The tragic phenomenon of poverty and destitution in the past countryside has ended. The material and cultural level of the peasants is improving year by year. During the first Five-Year Plan period alone, tens of thousands of collective farmers built new brick houses for themselves. Most villages have electricity supply. Illiteracy has been basically eliminated. There is a library in every village. The number of cinemas, sanatoriums, and cultural palaces is rapidly increasing.

In the struggle to fulfill the main task of the Second Five-Year Plan - to significantly improve the living standards of our working people - agriculture, especially agricultural production cooperatives, will play an important role.

Our country's agricultural production cooperatives, with their constantly increasing high yields and the improvement of the material and cultural living standards of the peasants, eloquently demonstrate their superiority over individual agriculture and attract an increasing number of peasants to embark on the road of cooperation. The final victory of socialism in the Bulgarian countryside is in sight.

    保加利亚农业的社会主义改造
    保加利亚经济学硕士  索非亚季米特洛夫农学院副院长  彼得科·基列夫
    九月九日是保加利亚人民共和国国庆十周年纪念。以工农联盟为基础的民主政权，是由于九月九日人民起义的结果而建立起来的。这次起义是在纳粹德国被击溃的过程中爆发的，由于苏联军队的决定性援助而取得了胜利。
    随着人民民主政权的建立，保加利亚开始了社会主义改造的阶段。在实行了资本主义工业康采恩和银行的国有化、土地改革以及其他民主改革措施以后，我国人民就面临着为社会主义社会奠定基础的主要任务了。
    我国人民的伟大领袖和导师格奥尔基·季米特洛夫曾在保加利亚共产党第五次代表大会上宣告：在我国建立社会主义经济基础的政策，是保加利亚共产党的总路线。这项政策已体现在我国人民提前一年完成的第一个五年计划（一九四九—一九五三年）中了。
    在保加利亚建立社会主义经济基础的基本任务，是实行社会主义工业化。这就需要有与大规模的社会主义经济相适应的农业，并要求农业的社会主义改造。
    作为农业社会主义改造锁钥的列宁的伟大农业合作化计划，是保加利亚共产党的农业政策的基础。在这个政策和苏联共产党在农业集体化方面的经验的指导下，保加利亚共产党领导劳动农民通过合作化的道路来进行农业的社会主义改造。
    保加利亚共产党遵循着列宁关于农业合作化计划的原则来领导农业的社会主义改造。它的农业政策以列宁的战略口号为指针：“稳稳倚靠着贫农，巩固与中农的联盟，坚决反对富农。”
    工人阶级与劳动农民联盟的目的，在于限制富农的剥削，并吸引劳动农民参加社会主义建设。
    限制富农的剥削，是通过强迫收购大型农业机器、实行土地改革和把农村工业企业收归国有等方法而实现的。为了这个目的，采取了下列各种措施：不准富农加入农业生产合作社，政权在税收政策、信贷和农产品的收购方面实行阶级差别待遇的方法。
      保加利亚解放以后不久，季米特洛夫就曾指出：在我国情况下，农业生产合作社是社会主义农业的最适当的形式。早在人民民主政权建立后的最初几年内，我国就有一千多个农业生产合作社在共产党的领导下建立起来了。
      在一九四九年——五年计划的第一年，工业生产量就超过了一九四八年百分之二十九点五。一九五零年，工业生产量已比一九三九年水平超过了三倍。同一时期，农业生产量却只刚刚超过一九三九年的水平。社会主义工业的发展极为迅速，但农业的发展却是难以令人满意的。
    土地改革后，个体的小农经济在更大的规模上占着优势。这样就不能进行扩大再生产，也不能满足迅速增长着的社会主义工业对原料的需要，不能满足城市和军队供应，以及国家储备的需要。
    农业落后于迅速增长着的工业的现象，阻碍了整个国民经济的发展。保加利亚部长会议主席契尔文科夫在一九五零年四月指出：“我们进一步的发展，有待于尽一切努力按照社会主义的方式来组织农业，把它转变成为大规模的经济。”
    另一方面，小的个体农业还滋生着资本主义。
    小规模农业生产的这两个缺点，在一九五零年社会主义工业化已获得巨大进展的当时，显得更为突出了。因而，随着我国进一步实行社会主义工业化，农业的社会主义改造问题，就成为迫切需要解决的了。
    我们的领袖和导师季米特洛夫指出：人民民主制度和社会主义是不可能建立在大规模的社会主义工业和小农业的基础上的。在进行社会主义建设与发展工业的同时，必须通过农业生产合作社和农业机器拖拉机站使农业改造为社会主义的。
    保加利亚解放之后，我国共产党根据列宁、斯大林关于农业社会主义改造的理论，实行了为迅速发展农业合作社准备条件的政策。
    早在一九五零年初，已存在着一些实行合作化的条件，有些其他的条件也在成熟中。
    人民民主制度——无产阶级专政的特殊形式，已经稳固地建立起来了。工业与运输业中的主要生产资料以及农业机器都已集中在国家手里。已成立的农业生产合作社，以他们的实际证明了农业生产合作社对小的个体农业的优越性。农产品的收购和对农民消费品的供应，几乎完全掌握在国家和消费合作社手里了。
    作为进行农业社会主义改造所必需的先决条件——足够的技术基础，是具备了的。我国迅速发展的工业与强大的苏联社会主义工业的援助，保证以一切必要的农业机器供应给处于社会主义改造进程之中的我国农业。伟大苏联的援助，是我国进行农业社会主义改造的有利条件。
    然而，我国农民中有很大一部分人现在还没有认识到农业合作化的优越性，因此“全部问题是使农民相信农业生产合作制的优越性。”（伏·契尔文科夫）
    一九五零年上半年，保加利亚共产党在劳动农民中间进行了广泛的宣传、组织和教育的工作。以令人信服的方式，向他们指出了苏联的集体农庄和我们农业生产合作社所获得的显著成就和无可辩驳的优越性。
    在一九五零年四月举行的第二次全国农业生产合作社代表会议上，曾讨论了有关农业生产合作社的重要问题，通过了以前曾在全国讨论过的农业生产合作社的模范章程。这次会议在使劳动农民认识到集体经营的优越性上，起着重要的作用。
    经济上限制富农的政策已收到成效。人民民主法律对于经常破坏政府法令的富农的严格制裁，使富农在劳动农民群众中间孤立了，并推动贫、中农走向农业生产合作化的道路。这就是何以在一九五零年下半年大多数劳动农民愈益认识到农业合作化的优越性而成批地加入合作社的原因。许多中农也自愿地参加了农业生产合作社。
    一九五零年一月，农业生产合作社有一千六百个，参加的农户占全国农户的百分之十四点二，耕地占全国耕地的百分之十一点二。到一九五零年末，农业生产合作社的数目已增加到两千五百八十九个，团结着全国百分之四十七点九的农户，拥有百分之四十四点五的耕地。
    一九五二年末，我国已有两千七百四十七个农业生产合作社——包括全国百分之五十二点三的农户和百分之六十点五的耕地。
    这是我国农业社会主义改造中一项伟大的历史性胜利。“这样的革命变革，是等于我国第二个九月九日的成就。”（伏·契尔文科夫）
    以列宁、斯大林关于农业社会主义改造的理论为指导的保加利亚共产党，十分重视机器和拖拉机站的特别重要性，十分重视它们在建立与巩固农村的社会主义制度中的作用，它们是结合社会主义工业与农业的方法。机器拖拉机站是党和政府在改造农业和以社会主义精神教育劳动农民的支柱。
    今年，我国农业中已拥有一百四十九个农业机器拖拉机站。约有一万五千台拖拉机（每台以十五匹马力计算）、一千八百台谷物收割联合机和数千台其他种类的农业机器，在我国的广阔土地上工作着。
    田间工作的机械化，在一九五四年已达到百分之四十八点六。去年，苏联制造的谷物收割联合机，收割了百分之二十三以上的麦田。
    现代农艺方法和复杂的农业技术，都已成为农业的一部分了。农业生产和牲畜繁殖率不断增加。在一九五三年，合作社农民比个体农民获得更高的收获量。例如：小麦收获量高出百分之二十一点七，玉蜀黍——百分之十八点五，向日葵种籽——百分之三十点二，棉花——百分之三十二等等。
    农业生产合作社与机器拖拉机站使粮食问题获得了解决。最近三四年以来，谷物的生产已比战前一九三九年的产量增加了三分之一。国家收购的谷物有三分之二是来自农业中的社会主义部分的。技术作物的播种面积已增为二倍。蔬菜、葡萄和果物种植业正在迅速发展。
    我国农业社会主义改造现阶段的基本任务，是从组织上、经济上和政治上来巩固农业生产合作社。党和政府颁布了许多重要的文件，提出要把在组织上、经济上和政治上巩固农业生产合作社作为重要的任务。
    我国农业生产合作社恪守合作化生活的基本法规——模范章程，并坚决贯彻党和政府的决定，因而在经济、政治以及组织的巩固上取得了显著的成就。
    农业生产合作社已为社员的幸福生活打下了巩固的基础。过去农村的悲惨与贫困现象已经结束了。农民的物质和文化水平在一年年地提高着。只在第一个五年计划时期，就有数万集体农民，为自己建筑了新的砖房。大多数村庄都有了电力的供应。文盲基本上被肃清了。每个村庄里都有一个图书馆。电影院、休养所和文化宫的数目在迅速增加着。
    在为完成第二个五年计划的主要任务——显著提高我国劳动人民的生活水平的斗争中，农业——首先是农业生产合作社将起重要的作用。
    我国的农业生产合作社，以不断增加的高额产量和农民物质文化生活水平提高的事实，雄辩地证明了它们较个体农业的优越性，并且吸引了日益增多的农民走上合作化的道路。社会主义在保加利亚农村的最后胜利，已经在望了。
