Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, September 17th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, wrote a letter to comfort the Vietnam People's Army soldiers, cadres, and voluntarily migrating people who are withdrawing from the south of the provisional military demarcation line to the north. According to the armistice agreement, the People's Army units in the central Vietnamese provinces of Quảng Trị and Thừa Thiên have withdrawn to the north of the provisional military demarcation line. The People's Army units in the Fifth Interzone and South Vietnam are also preparing to move to North Vietnam.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh wrote in his letter: In order to fulfill the armistice agreement, you have had to temporarily leave your hometowns. But you have the opportunity to be close to the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the Central Government, and to live close to our northern troops and compatriots. Whether from the South or the North, we are one family.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh said: When peace is consolidated, unification is achieved, and independence and democracy are completed, you will return to your hometowns with joy. At that time, perhaps I will visit our lovely South Vietnam with you.

    胡志明主席写信慰问自南部北撤的军民
    【新华社十七日讯】据越南通讯社北越十六日讯：越南民主共和国胡志明主席写信慰问从临时军事分界线以南往北撤退的越南人民军战士、干部和自愿迁移的人民。按照停战协定，中越广治、承天两省的人民军部队已经撤到临时军事分界线北面。中越南部第五联区和南越的人民军部队也正准备动身到北越来。
    胡志明主席在他的信中写道：为了履行停战协定，你们不得不暂时远离你们的家乡。但是你们得到机会靠近越南劳动党中央委员会和中央政府，靠近我们北方的军队和同胞居住。不论来自南方或北方，我们都是一家人。
    胡志明主席说：当和平得以巩固，统一得以实现，独立和民主得以完成的时候，你们将欢欣鼓舞地回到你们的家乡。那个时候，或许我将和你们一起去访我们的可爱的南越。
