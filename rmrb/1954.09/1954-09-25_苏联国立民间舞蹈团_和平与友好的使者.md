    The Soviet National Folk Dance Ensemble – "Envoys of Peace and Friendship"
    By Our Correspondent Bai Sheng
    The Soviet National Folk Dance Ensemble has arrived in Beijing from Moscow to participate in the opening ceremony of the Soviet Economic and Cultural Achievements Exhibition and will perform during the opening period.
    The Soviet National Folk Dance Ensemble is one of the largest artistic groups in the Soviet Union, with 110 performers and 45 orchestra members. It regularly performs over 160 different dances. The ensemble creatively develops the rich and varied folk dance art of the Soviet nationalities, and its performances are not only highly honored in the Soviet Union but also enjoy great international prestige.
    The artistic director and many of the performers of the dance ensemble are highly honored dance artists in the Soviet Union. The founder and artistic director of the ensemble, Igor Moiseyev, is a People's Artist of the USSR and a three-time Stalin Prize winner. He is an outstanding artistic activist. After graduating from the affiliated dance school of the State Bolshoi Theatre in 1924, he joined the Bolshoi Theatre's dance troupe. He was only eighteen years old at the time. From 1929, he began to work as a choreographer for dance dramas. At that time, he developed a strong interest in folk dance creation and began to devote himself to the study of the dances of the various nationalities of the Soviet Union, thus achieving great success in folk dance art.
    The main performers of the dance ensemble who have won the Stalin Prize and honorary titles include: Stalin Prize winners and Honored Artists of Russia, T. Zeifert, I. Kardashov; Honored Artist of Russia V. Arsentyev, Stalin Prize winners L. Golovanov, T. Mozalevskaya, V. Aristov, I. Chagdaeva, A. Loktionova, V. Savin, L. Timofeeva, M. Shishkin, as well as the orchestra's chief conductor S. Galperin, and chief artist N. Lakov.
    The dance ensemble was founded in Moscow in February 1937. In 1936, the Soviet Union held an All-Union Folk Dance Festival. At that time, many talented dancers from all nationalities of the Soviet Union came to Moscow from cities and villages in various Soviet republics. Their performances showed how rich and varied the dance art of the Soviet nationalities was. At that time, Moiseyev participated in the program review work of this festival. He felt that it would be a pity if such a rich and varied folk dance art was not organized, improved, and promoted. Therefore, he thought it was necessary to establish a folk dance ensemble. So he wrote an application to the government. His application was quickly approved by the government, and he was entrusted with the organizational work. In the winter of 1937, when the Soviet National Folk Dance Ensemble made its debut performance in the Column Hall of the Moscow Trade Union Building, there were only thirty performers and a folk band of twelve people. Only ten kinds of folk dances were performed. Although there were not many programs performed this time, it was warmly welcomed by the audience from the beginning.
    Since its establishment, the dance ensemble has traveled to various republics of the Soviet Union and has also performed in people's democratic countries such as Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Poland, Hungary, and the German Democratic Republic more than once. The dance ensemble has made considerable contributions to the cause of enhancing the great friendship between the peoples of all countries. When the dance ensemble performed in the people's democratic countries, the audience respectfully called the dance ensemble "envoys of peace and friendship." Under its influence, many people's democratic countries also established their own folk dance organizations.
    The dance ensemble also has an affiliated dance school, which trains many young and outstanding dance performers. In 1947, the students of the dance ensemble's affiliated school and a group of young performers from the dance ensemble participated in the competition of the World Democratic Youth Festival held in Prague. They won two first prizes for collective performances and five first prizes for individual performances in the folk dance competition.
    The dance ensemble has studied and learned our country's folk dances with the greatest enthusiasm. They use various methods, such as conducting research from our country's films, pictorials, and pictures. The performers also went to the Moscow Museum of Oriental Culture to find materials related to our country's dance art. In 1952, they performed our country's "Big Waist Drum" in Moscow, which was warmly welcomed by the audience. The performers of the dance ensemble further overcame various difficulties and learned our country's "San Cha Kou" and "Red Silk Dance."
    The dance ensemble never moves the unprocessed folk dances to the stage without any processing. It has done a lot of work in sorting out folk art creation and has also gained a lot. The performers not only carefully study folk dances, but also deeply study the lives of the people, study the origin of dances and the characteristics of the people.
    The ensemble's creative activities are diverse. It deeply explores the content of various folk dances, refines them, and makes their forms more perfect. For example, the Russian "Bayanov" dance and "Six Couples" dance, the Ukrainian "Mecheritsa" dance, the Georgian "Kartuli" dance, and the Adjarian "Khorumi" dance have all been processed in this way. The dance ensemble also creates new dances based on national traditions. For example, the themes and topics that already exist in folk songs and epics are expressed in dance form. For example, the popular program "Potato Dance" was created by I. Moiseyev based on the theme and melody of a beautiful Belarusian folk song "Potato." This dance vividly depicts the labor process of farmers planting and harvesting potatoes. In Belarusian rural festivals, people can often see girls happily dancing this dance. In addition, the dance art expresses the thoughts and emotions of a nation's people in their present or past lives. Various integrated dances in the dance ensemble, such as the dance suite composed of two groups of dances, the Russian "Scenes of the Past" and "Scenes of the Soviet Era," are all created using this method. In the "Scenes of the Past" integrated dance, such as the dances "Sunday" and "Moscow Suburban Lyric Poetry," the images of pre-revolutionary Russian figures are depicted in a satirical form; while in the "Scenes of the Soviet Era" integrated dance, such as the dances "Collective Farm Street" and "Football Dance," the images of Soviet figures are reflected.
    "Peace and Friendship" is a successful masterpiece with an extremely clear theme. It not only depicts the great image of the Soviet people, but also depicts the great image of the working people of the people's democratic countries, and embodies the noble ideas of all nations loving peace and friendship in the dance. Here are China's "Red Silk Dance" and "San Cha Kou," as well as Korea's "Sword Dance," Mongolia's "Knight Dance," and so on. Each dance has a unique style.
    The dance ensemble's symphony orchestra plays a major role in the performance. It not only serves as musical accompaniment, but also the orchestra's chief conductor Galperin and orchestra members Zhimokhov, Avsietiev, and others often process many folk tunes. The orchestra's performers diligently collect and study folk songs and melodies, which, after careful processing and selection, become the basis of many dance music.
    The glorious achievements and high reputation of the dance ensemble are obtained under the infinite care of the Soviet government and the continuous efforts of the dance ensemble. The dance ensemble has strict training. Because every performer realizes that it is not enough to have only dance performance talent, but also to have a selfless spirit of love for labor and keen observation skills. They work from nine o'clock in the morning until late at night every day, with only short breaks in between. This spirit of selfless work and humble learning is worthy of learning by our dance art workers. (Attached picture)

    苏联国立民间舞蹈团——“和平与友好的使者”
    本报记者　柏生
    苏联国立民间舞蹈团从莫斯科来到了北京，将参加苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会开幕典礼，并将在开幕期间举行演出。
    苏联国立民间舞蹈团是苏联最大的艺术团体之一，它有一百一十名演员和四十五名乐队队员。经常演出的舞蹈节目达一百六十种以上。舞蹈团创造性地发挥了苏联各民族丰富多采的民间舞蹈艺术，它的演出不仅在苏联享有最高的荣誉，而且在国际上也享有极高的声誉。
    舞蹈团的艺术领导人和许多演员都是在苏联享有极高荣誉的舞蹈艺术家。舞蹈团的创建者、艺术领导人伊·莫伊塞耶夫，是苏联人民演员、三次斯大林奖金获得者。他是一位杰出的艺术活动家。一九二四年他在国立大剧院舞蹈团的附属舞蹈学校毕业后，就参加了大剧院的舞蹈团。当时他只有十八岁。从一九二九年起他开始担任舞剧的编导。那时他便对民间的舞蹈创作发生了极浓厚的兴趣，并开始潜心研究苏联各民族的舞蹈，因此在民间舞蹈艺术上获得极高的成就。
    舞蹈团中荣获斯大林奖金和荣誉称号的主要演员有：斯大林奖金获得者、俄罗斯功勋演员塔·泽依费尔特，伊·卡尔达晓夫；俄罗斯功勋演员维·阿尔谢里耶夫，斯大林奖金获得者列·高洛万诺夫，塔·莫札列夫斯卡娅，维·阿里斯托夫，依·查格达耶娃，阿·洛克齐翁诺娃，华·萨文，丽·吉摩费耶娃，米·施士金，以及乐队总指挥萨·加里别林，总艺术家尼·拉柯夫等。
    舞蹈团一九三七年二月间成立于莫斯科。一九三六年苏联举办了一次全苏民间舞蹈大会演。当时苏联各族人民的许多天才舞蹈家都从苏联各共和国的城市和乡村来到莫斯科。他们的表演显示出苏联各族人民的舞蹈艺术是如此丰富多采。当时莫伊塞耶夫参加了这次会演的节目审查工作。他感到这样丰富多采的民间舞蹈艺术，如果不加以整理、提高和推广，实在可惜。因此，他想到有成立民间舞蹈团的必要。于是他便向政府写了一个申请书。他的申请书很快就得到政府的批准；政府并委托他来进行组织工作。一九三七年冬，当苏联国立民间舞蹈团在莫斯科工会大厦圆柱大厅中作首次公演时，只有三十个演员和一个由十二人组成的民间乐队。上演的民间舞蹈只有十种。这次上演的节目虽然不多，可是一开始就受到了观众的热烈欢迎。
    舞蹈团成立以来，它的足迹已遍历了苏联各个共和国，也曾经不只一次地到捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、波兰、匈牙利、德意志民主共和国等人民民主国家举行演出。在增进各族人民的伟大友谊事业中，舞蹈团作过不少的贡献。舞蹈团在人民民主国家演出时，观众们尊敬地称呼舞蹈团为“和平与友好的使者”，在它的影响下，许多人民民主国家也成立了自己的民间舞蹈组织。
    舞蹈团还附设了一个舞蹈学校，培养许多年青优秀的舞蹈演员。一九四七年舞蹈团附设学校的学生们和舞蹈团的一批青年演员参加了在布拉格举行的世界民主青年联欢节的比赛。他们在民间舞蹈比赛中获得了两个集体第一名和五个单独表演第一名。
    舞蹈团怀着最大的热情研究和学习了我国的民间舞蹈。他们运用各种方法，如从我国的电影、画报、图片中进行研究。演员们并到莫斯科东方文化博物馆中找有关我国舞蹈艺术的材料。一九五二年，他们在莫斯科演出了我国的“大腰鼓”，受到观众的热烈欢迎。舞蹈团的演员们并进一步克服了各种困难，学会了我国的“三岔口”和“红绸舞”。
    舞蹈团从来不把没有加工过的民间舞蹈原封不动地搬到舞台上。它在整理民间艺术创作方面曾做了许多工作，也得到了很大的收获。演员们不仅认真地研究民间舞蹈，而且深入地研究人民的生活，研究舞蹈的产生和人民的特性。
    舞蹈团的创作活动，是多样性的。它深刻地发掘了各种民间舞的内容，加以提炼，并使它的形式更加完善，例如俄罗斯的“巴阳诺夫”舞和“六对人”舞，乌克兰的“麦切里查”舞，格鲁吉亚的“卡尔土里”舞，阿扎里的“霍鲁米”舞等，都经过这样的加工。舞蹈团还根据民族传统创造新的舞蹈。例如，把民歌、史诗中已经存在的题材和主题用舞蹈形式表现出来。例如，受到观众欢迎的节目“马铃薯舞”，就是由伊·莫伊塞耶夫根据白俄罗斯一首美丽的民歌“马铃薯”的题材和旋律创作的。这个舞蹈形象地描绘了农民栽植和收割马铃薯的劳动过程。在白俄罗斯的农村节日里，人们经常可以看到姑娘们欢乐地跳着这个舞蹈。此外，用舞蹈艺术表现一个民族的人民现时生活或过去生活中的思想、情感。舞蹈团中的各种综合舞，例如俄罗斯的“过去的情景”和“苏维埃时代的情景”两组舞蹈所组成的舞蹈组曲，就都是用这种方法进行创造的。在“过去的情景”综合舞中，如“星期日”、“莫斯科近郊抒情诗”等舞蹈，以讽刺的形式刻划革命前俄国的人物的形象；而在“苏维埃时代的情景”综合舞中，如“集体农庄的大街”、“足球舞”等舞蹈，则反映了苏维埃人物的形象。
    “和平和友好”是一个成功的杰作，主题思想极为鲜明，它不仅描绘了苏维埃人民的伟大形象，同时也描绘了人民民主国家劳动人民的伟大形象，把各民族热爱和平与友谊的高贵思想都体现在舞蹈中。这里有中国的“红绸舞”和“三岔口”，还有朝鲜的“剑舞”，蒙古的“骑士舞”等。每一个舞蹈都具有独特的风格。
    舞蹈团的交响乐队在表演中起着很大的作用。它不仅担任音乐伴奏，乐队总指挥加里别林和乐队队员日茂霍夫、阿夫谢蒂也夫等，还对许多民间曲调经常进行加工工作。乐队的演员们辛勤地收集和研究着民间的歌曲和旋律，这些歌曲和旋律经过细致的加工和选择，便成为许多舞蹈音乐的基础。
    舞蹈团的光辉成绩和高度的声誉，是在苏联政府的无限关怀和舞蹈团的不断努力中得到的。舞蹈团有着严格的训练。因为，每一个演员都认识到，只具有舞蹈表演的才能是不够的，还必须具有忘我的热爱劳动的精神以及敏锐的观察能力。他们每天从上午九点钟一直工作到深夜，中间仅有短短的休息时间。这种忘我地工作和虚心学习的精神，是值得我们舞蹈艺术工作者学习的。（附图片）
