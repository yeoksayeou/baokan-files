Xinhua News Agency, August 8th, London Dispatch: Indian Representative to the United Nations, Menon, delivered a speech at a luncheon of the Indian Journalists Association in London on the 7th, condemning the proposed Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO).

Menon said that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, negotiated in Manila, is an attempt to divide the peoples of Asian countries and has not received the support of the people of the Southeast Asian region.

Menon believes that placing the three countries of Indochina—Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnam—under the "protection" of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization violates the Indochina armistice agreements. He said, "According to the terms of the Geneva Accords, member states of the Indochina Federation cannot have relations with the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization—either directly or indirectly—without violating this agreement." Menon emphasized that the Geneva Accords do not allow the three Indochinese countries to participate in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, nor do they allow them to be "protected" by this organization. Menon said that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization violates the Geneva Conference agreements.

    印度驻联合国代表梅农在伦敦发表演说指出
    东南亚公约与日内瓦会议的协议相违反
    【新华社八日讯】伦敦消息：印度驻联合国代表梅农七日在伦敦印度记者协会午宴上发表演说，谴责拟订中的东南亚公约。
    梅农说，在马尼拉谈判的东南亚公约是企图分裂亚洲各国人民，这个公约没有得到东南亚地区人民的支持。
    梅农认为：把印度支那的三个国家——老挝、柬埔寨和南越置于东南亚公约的“保护”之下是违反印度支那停战协定的。他说：“根据日内瓦协定的条款，印度支那联邦成员国不可能与东南亚公约组织发生关系——不论是直接地还是间接地——而不致违反这个协定。”梅农强调指出：日内瓦协议不容许印度支那三国参加东南亚公约，也不容许它们受这一公约组织的“保护”。梅农说：东南亚公约是与日内瓦会议的协议相违反的。
