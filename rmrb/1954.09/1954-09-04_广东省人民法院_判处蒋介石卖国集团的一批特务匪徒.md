    Guangdong Provincial People's Court
    Sentences a Batch of Special Agent Bandits from the Chiang Kai-shek Traitorous Clique
    The Guangdong Provincial People's Court recently sentenced a batch of special agent bandits dispatched by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to sneak into the mainland and hide in the interior. Among them, Qiu Yinglie, Li Yexiong, Yin Yingkai, and Chen Meilin, who committed heinous crimes, were sentenced to death. The remaining Huang Xiangbao, Xue Lianghan, He Yang, and others, totaling thirteen people, were sentenced to life imprisonment, fixed-term imprisonment, and educational release, respectively.
    This group of special agent bandits was directly dispatched by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to infiltrate eastern Guangdong to carry out sabotage activities. The criminal Chen Meilin joined the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's "Chinese People's Anti-Communist Self-Defense and National Salvation Army" in Hong Kong after liberation and was appointed as the commander of the 72nd Regiment. In the winter of 1950, Chen led Yan Zhongying, the commander of the bandit 71st Regiment (who has been captured and executed by us), to sneak back to Huiyang County to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. In May 1952, Chen and bandits He Yang, He Tianxi, Huang Jianqing, Su Zhendong, and others carried radio stations, pistols, telescopes, and other military supplies, sneaking into the third district of Huiyang County to carry out counter-revolutionary armed sabotage activities. After Chen and others sneaked in, they were discovered by our militia. The bandit Huang Jianqing was shot and killed on the spot, and Su Zhendong and three others fled to Baoan County and were captured by us. Chen and He Yang, He Tianxi, and others fled back to Hong Kong. However, the counter-revolutionary elements did not give up. On July 15, 1952, Chen led bandits He Yang and Guo Ren to sneak back again. Under our close surveillance, the criminals were surrounded and captured by our militia on the second day of their return. Among this group of criminals, some were members of special agent organizations before liberation and were resolutely counter-revolutionary elements who refused to repent and were enemies of the people after liberation.
    After sentencing this group of special agent bandits, the Guangdong Provincial People's Court escorted the criminals to their original hometowns of Chaozhou, Huiyang, Jieyang, and other places for public pronouncement. The people in various places expressed their warm support for the judgments of the People's Court.

    广东省人民法院
    判处蒋介石卖国集团的一批特务匪徒
    广东省人民法院最近判处一批蒋介石卖国集团派遣潜入大陆和隐藏内地的特务匪徒。其中罪大恶极的邱英烈、李业雄、鄞应凯、陈美麟四人被判处死刑，其余黄想保、薛良汉、何养等十三人分别判处无期徒刑、有期徒刑和教育释放。
    这批特务匪徒受蒋介石卖国集团直接派遣，潜入粤东进行破坏活动。罪犯陈美麟，解放后在香港参加蒋介石卖国集团“中国人民反共自卫救国军”，并被委任为第七十二团团长，一九五零年冬，陈犯带领匪七十一团团长严忠英（已被我捕获处决）偷渡返回惠阳县进行反革命活动。一九五二年五月，陈犯又和匪徒何养、何添喜、黄剑青、苏振东等八人携带电台、手枪、望远镜等军用品，潜入惠阳县第三区进行反革命武装破坏活动。陈犯等偷渡潜入后，就被我民兵发觉；匪徒黄剑青当场被击毙，苏振东等三人逃到宝安县被我捕获，陈犯和何养、何添喜等逃回香港。但是反革命分子并不死心，一九五二年七月十五日，陈犯又率领匪徒何养、郭仁再度潜回；在我严密的监视下，罪犯等潜回的第二日，便被我民兵包围捕获。这批罪犯中，还有的是解放前参加特务组织，解放后仍不悔改的坚决和人民为敌的反革命分子。
    广东省人民法院在判处这批特务匪徒后，就把罪犯押往原籍潮州、惠阳、揭阳等地宣判执行。各地人民对人民法院的判决表示热烈拥护。
