    The Central People's Government Ministry of Higher Education convened the Higher Industrial School Basic Course Teaching Syllabus Examination and Approval Meeting, held at the Dalian Institute of Technology from August 11th to 24th. The meeting examined and approved the teaching syllabi for eight basic courses commissioned by the Central People's Government Ministry of Higher Education to various higher engineering colleges. These courses, intended for different majors, include: Higher Mathematics, Physics, General Chemistry, Descriptive Geometry and Drafting, Mechanics of Materials, Electrical Engineering, Thermodynamics, and Metallography and Heat Treatment.

    More than 390 directors and teachers from basic course teaching and research offices in higher engineering colleges across the country participated in the meeting. Zeng Zhaolun, Vice Minister of the Central People's Government Ministry of Higher Education, also attended to provide guidance.

    The specific work of examining and approving the teaching syllabi was carried out in eight large groups. The teachers carefully studied the Soviet teaching syllabi or textbooks and made revisions in light of China's actual conditions. For example, in determining the content of the teaching syllabi, each group reached a consensus after heated debates on the integration of theory and practice, and the integration of advanced Soviet experience with China's actual situation. They also shared common views on how to embody the dialectical materialist worldview and implement patriotic ideology in the teaching syllabi. This examination and approval of the teaching syllabi was carried out in accordance with the unified teaching plans for each major. The revised teaching syllabi not only improved in scientific systematicness and completeness, but also unified professional terminology where necessary and possible. Furthermore, it took into account the close connection with related courses. In the future, teaching based on these teaching syllabi will play a significant role in ensuring the training of qualified personnel for industrial construction.

    The representatives participating in the meeting demonstrated a spirit of unity and eagerness to learn during the process of examining and approving the teaching syllabi, and criticized certain bourgeois academic viewpoints. Before the end of the meeting, representatives from various schools widely exchanged teaching experiences and materials. A liaison station was also established at the meeting to be responsible for future communication and exchange of experiences in various courses.

    中央人民政府高等教育部召开会议
    审订高等工业学校基础课程教学大纲
    中央人民政府高等教育部召开的高等工业学校基础课程教学大纲审订会议，八月十一日到二十四日在大连工学院举行。会议审订了中央人民政府高等教育部委托各高等工科院校负责起草的高等数学，物理、普通化学、画法几何及制图、材料力学、电工学、热工学、金属学及热处理等用于不同专业的八种基础课程的教学大纲。
    全国高等工科院校基础课程教研室主任、教师等三百九十多人参加了这个会议，中央人民政府高等教育部副部长曾昭抡也到会指导。
    审订教学大纲的具体工作是分别在八个大组里进行的。教师们认真学习了苏联的教学大纲或教材，结合中国实际进行审订。如在确定教学大纲内容时，各组对理论和实际结合，苏联先进经验和中国实际情况结合等方面，教师们都经过热烈的争论取得了一致的认识；对教学大纲中如何体现辩证唯物主义世界观和贯彻爱国主义思想也有了共同的看法。这次审订教学大纲是根据各专业统一的教学计划进行的，审订后的教学大纲不仅科学系统性和完整性都有所提高，大纲中的专业名词等也都作了必要和可能的统一，而且照顾了和有关课程之间的密切联系。今后根据这些教学大纲教学，对保证培养合格的工业建设人材将起很大作用。
    参加这次会议的代表在审订教学大纲过程中表现了团结和虚心学习的精神，并批判了某些资产阶级的学术观点。会议结束前，各校代表广泛地交流了教学经验和教学资料，会上还成立了联络站，负责今后各门课程经验交流的联络工作。
