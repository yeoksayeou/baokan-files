The Soviet Exhibition Hall was jointly created by Soviet architects and Chinese working people. Its significance lies not only in introducing the achievements of Soviet economic and cultural construction, allowing us to see the equipment and products of various departments of Soviet industry and agriculture at close range, and to see the sculptures, paintings, crafts, literary works, and all other cultural activities reflecting the glorious labor of the Soviet peoples and their happy lives. It also showcases a prosperous scene of Soviet architectural art to the Chinese people.

Under the care of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet architectural cause has gone through a glorious journey. In the short span of thirty-six years, Soviet architects have completed work that would have been difficult to accomplish in the past three centuries. They have made special contributions and accumulated many creative experiences worthy of our study in activities that improve the living conditions of working people, transform the original appearance of various cities, and build large factories and enterprises… The completion of the Soviet Exhibition Hall will undoubtedly play an inspiring and exemplary role for the young architectural cause of New China.

The Soviet Exhibition Hall is magnificent in appearance and imposing in its grandeur, giving people an impression of solemnity and beauty. This is partly due to its complete layout and excellent spatial composition, and partly due to the vivid shapes, bright and gorgeous colors, and exquisite architectural decorations.

In stark contrast to formalism and structuralism, art decorations here are not just for embellishment or something dispensable. Their existence is regarded as an integral part of the building's form, receiving universal attention from all designers. Architects Andreyev and Kesnova, in the initial stages of planning the artistic image of the Soviet Exhibition Hall, made specific arrangements and principle regulations for the decorative parts and decorative themes, ensuring that there was no flaw between it and the building as a whole. At the same time, they required that every piece of art decoration must create an impact on people's emotions—a longing for a socialist, peaceful, and happy world.

The range of materials used for the architectural decoration of the Soviet Exhibition Hall is broad and free. Stars symbolizing all the beautiful wishes of mankind, as well as the hammer, sickle, and laurel leaves symbolizing the glory of labor, are widely used. Due to proper handling, there is no sense of abuse or vulgarity. Plump grains that smell fragrant and will splash out honey when touched, cotton bolls, sunflowers, corn, grapes, apples, pineapples, watermelons, berries... show people the inexhaustible material wealth of the Soviet state. Many humorous and endearing birds and animals and beautiful flowers reflect the optimistic nature of the Soviet people and the joy of their lives. The trees, flowers, plants, insects, fish, and birds of the real world can all be used as creative materials to set off and express profound ideological content and characteristics of the times.

Soviet decorative art is a multi-ethnic art, so rich and colorful. The architectural decoration of the Soviet Exhibition Hall carefully selected valuable traditions that meet the requirements of real life from the decorative arts of various Soviet nationalities—first and foremost, the Russian national decorative arts—and processed and transformed them using socialist realism methods. And it selected forms close to Chinese decorative art and acceptable to the broad masses of the Chinese people from the vast treasure of Soviet decorative art as the basis for creation, instead of stuffing those unfamiliar or unpopular things to the Chinese people without thinking. There are powder-painted decorations with similarities to the Forbidden City, the Temple of Heaven, or the Zhihua Temple, and glazed roof tiles, window lattices, and wood and stone carvings similar to the traditional Chinese architectural forms. These have been refined, given new content according to the overall design intention of Soviet experts, and simplified in their forms of expression, which is very different from mechanically copying and swallowing whole. As a result of this creative effort, the artistic image of the Soviet Exhibition Hall has become more perfect, and its appeal to people's lives has been greatly enhanced. Thinking that everything must be done according to the way our ancestors used to do it, without criticism or creation, is lazy behavior and must not be allowed to continue.

Architectural decoration design is a rigorous and meticulous creative work. The completion of an art decoration design usually goes through several complex processes: collecting materials, determining and studying the object of expression, making various different plans, selecting, depicting, and making multiple modifications based on possible difficulties during construction or production. This requires a spirit of tireless research and humble learning. Soviet experts often teach us: "Making one more plan and making one more modification will give us one more opportunity to choose and eliminate shortcomings." The sloppy style of improvisation and eagerness for quick results is subject to due criticism here.

Decorative design should achieve consistency in form and style between the parts and the whole, and between the parts themselves. In order to meet certain special requirements, it is necessary to change the decorative style in appropriate occasions. If handled properly, it will have a tortuous and rich effect. One day, when we walk from the magnificent central hall, which echoes the joyful tunes of the Soviet working people, from the imposing central industrial exhibition hall, which displays the infinite creative power of socialist industry under the brilliant light of Lenin and Stalin, from the tranquil and elegant, poetic Moscow Restaurant, to the coffee room with its walls painted with bright Russian folk patterns and a rich garden atmosphere, or the small handicraft exhibition hall with its exquisite and humorous wood carvings of flowers and birds and strong ethnic colors, our emotions will undergo several contrasting changes with the ingenious arrangement of the architect. This expression method excellently meets the complex requirements of commemorative and exhibition architecture, and infinitely enriches the artistic image of the Soviet Exhibition Hall.

Design is of course important, but it is still just a drawing. The key is to make the design concrete through the hands of decorative sculptors, decorative artists, and decorative workers. The completion of an art decoration means that the design has only done half of the work, and the other half depends on these comrades. From the perspective of production and processing, the drawings can often only help explain the architect's intentions and provide decorative sculptors, decorative artists, and decorative workers with references. Whether the architectural decoration can achieve a beautiful effect still depends on the re-creation of these comrades. If there are defects due to copying the drawings, it should be said that it is the fault of the decorative sculptor, decorative artist, or decorative worker. Architecture is a comprehensive art, and the architect cannot take over all the work of these people, which requires everyone to cooperate sincerely. The erroneous idea that decorative sculptors, decorative artists, and decorative workers are only doing things according to the architect's intentions and cannot be said to have any creation was severely criticized by Comrades Andreyev and Kesnova. The satisfactory achievements of the architectural decoration of the Soviet Exhibition Hall today are inseparable from the help given to us by Soviet experts in this regard.

There are many kinds of art decorations in the Soviet Exhibition Hall, and the requirements for production and processing are also very strict. At the beginning, we determined that many designs could not be realized in China due to the lack of experienced technicians and modern production equipment, and hoped to solve them in Moscow. This idea was promptly corrected by Soviet experts. He took us all over the state-owned special craft factories and workshops in Beijing to understand the situation, and found many folk artists who were very accomplished in metal casting and copper inlaying techniques. Although they had abandoned their familiar business for a long time and had not done any fancy work for many years, through the works of their youth that were preserved, we could still vaguely see their wisdom that had been dusted off. One day, when you see the Soviet Socialist Republic Union embedded on the central pedestal of the Golden Pagoda, and the national emblems of the sixteen Soviet Union republics hanging on the square in front of the door, when you see the golden and colorful inlaid glass in the central hall, when you see the group of vivid bronze birds and animals on the pillars of the Moscow Restaurant, you will be moved by their amazing creative genius. What we thought could not be done, our worker comrades have all done it, and they have done it quickly and well. Here, I can't help but think of what Comrade Andreyev told me at the beginning: "In the past, they had never done such big things, and they may not do well at the beginning, so they are not trusted and are not given the opportunity to create. When will they start doing it? When will China's architectural decoration technology be able to develop on its own without relying on other countries?" For a designer, these words are very important. Not knowing how to discover the endless creative potential hidden in the people, not knowing how to inspire and encourage craft technicians to boldly display their creative wisdom, and thinking that there is no way to do everything, so we have to rely on others to help or simply make do are the pebbles blocking the way to the development of decorative art. Let's all work together to move them away.

We have received the selfless help of Soviet architects Andreyev and Kesnova and construction expert Comrade Plodochev, and relying on the creative labor of decorative sculptors, decorative artists, and decorative workers, we have successfully completed all the decoration projects of the Soviet Exhibition Hall. Their achievements have been gratefully acknowledged by the designers and will be enthusiastically praised by all visitors.

    我从苏联展览馆装饰设计工作中学了些什么
    奚小彭
    苏联展览馆是苏联建筑家和中国劳动人民共同创造的。它的意义不仅在于介绍苏联经济建设和文化建设成就，让我们可以就近看到苏联工业及农业各部门的装备和产品，看见反映苏维埃各族人民光荣劳动以及他们幸福生活的雕刻、绘画、工艺、文学作品和其他一切文化活动情况。并且在中国人民面前展示了苏维埃建筑艺术一片繁荣景象。
    苏维埃建筑事业，在列宁—斯大林的关怀之下，已经走过了一段光辉的路程。短短的三十六年之间，苏维埃建筑师们完成了过去三个世纪也难完成的工作。他们在改善劳动人民的生活条件，在改造各个城市的原来面貌，在兴建大的工厂企业……等大规模变革现实的活动中，建立了特殊功绩，积累了许许多多值得我们好好学习的创作经验。苏联展览馆的建成，无疑的，将对新中国年轻的建筑事业起着鼓舞作用和示范作用。
    苏联展览馆外貌雄伟，气势磅礴，给人一种庄严、美丽的印象。这一方面由于它的完整的平面布署和卓越的空间构图，另一方面应该归功于那些造形生动，色彩明朗绚丽，制作精美的建筑装饰。
    与形式主义、结构主义截然不同，美术装饰物在这里不仅为了点缀点缀，或者是可有可无的东西，它底存在，是被作为构成建筑体形不可分割的有机部分，受到所有设计人员的普遍重视。建筑师安德烈耶夫和凯丝诺娃，在计划塑造苏联展览馆艺术形象的开始阶段，便对装饰部位及装饰题材作了具体安排和原则规定，不让它和建筑整体之间存在丝毫破锭。同时要求每一件美术装饰物必须能在人们的感情中造成影响——对社会主义和平幸福世界的向往。
    苏联展览馆建筑装饰取材的范围是广阔自由的。象征人类一切美好愿望的星星及劳动光荣的锤子、镰刀和桂叶，被广泛地采用着。由于处理得当，并无滥用和庸俗的感觉。丰硕的、可以闻到香味、一碰就会溅出蜜浆来的谷物、棉桃、向日葵、玉蜀黍、葡萄、苹果、凤梨、西瓜、莓果……向人们显示着苏维埃国家取之不竭的物质财富。许多造型诙谐、逗人喜爱的鸟兽和美丽的花朵，反映了苏联人民乐观的天性以及他们生活的欢腾。现实世界的树木花草，虫鱼鸟兽，无一不可作为创作的取材对象，无一不能用来烘托和表现深刻的思想内容和时代特征。
    苏维埃装饰艺术是多民族的艺术，它们是那么丰盛和多采。苏联展览馆建筑装饰，于苏联各民族——首先是俄罗斯民族装饰艺术中，精选了符合现实生活要求的珍贵传统，用社会主义现实主义方法予以加工改造。并从苏维埃装饰艺术浩若瀚海的宝藏中，选择与中国装饰艺术接近的、又为中国广大群众乐于接受的形式作为创作基础，不是不经思索便把那些陌生的或是不受欢迎的东西硬塞给中国人民。这里有与故宫、祈年殿或者智化寺同出一脉的沥粉彩画，有与中国建筑传统形式类似的檐口琉璃瓦件、门窗格棂以及木石雕刻。这些都是经过提炼，根据苏联专家总的设计意图，赋予了新的内容并精简了它底表现形式，和死搬硬套、生吞活剥之间存在着很大差别。由于这种努力创造的结果，使苏联展览馆艺术形象更臻完美，并且大大增强了它们对人民生活的感染力量。认为一切都得按照我们祖先曾经采用过的方式进行，不加批判，也不必创造，是懒汉行为，不能让它继续存在。
    建筑装饰设计，是一种严密细致的创造工作。一项美术装饰设计的完成，通常总要经过汇集资料、确定和研究表现对象，作出各种不同方案，挑选、描绘，根据施工或制作当中可能发生的困难情况作多次修改等几个复杂过程。这就需要不辞辛苦的钻研和虚心学习的精神。苏联专家经常教导我们说：“多做一个方案，多作一次修改，便多一个选择和消除缺点的机会。”信手拈来和急于求成的粗制滥造作风，在这里受到了应有的批评。
    装饰设计应该做到局部与整体之间，局部与局部之间形式和风格一致。为了满足某些特殊要求，在适当的场合变换一下装饰情调是必要的。只要处理得当，将会收到曲折、丰富的效果。有一天，当我们从宏伟壮丽、响彻了苏维埃劳动人民欢乐曲调的中央大厅，从气魄雄伟、在列宁——斯大林光辉照耀下显示着社会主义工业无限创造威力的中央工业陈列馆，从宁静雅致的、充满诗意的莫斯科餐厅里面，走向满壁画着鲜丽的俄罗斯民间花纹林园情调馥郁的咖啡室，或者是有着精美的、颇富风趣的木雕花鸟，民族色彩浓厚的小型手工艺陈列馆的时候，我们的感情将会随着建筑师的巧妙安排经过几次对比强烈的变化。这种表现手法，无比卓越的满足了纪念性展览性建筑所提出的复杂要求，并且无限丰富了苏联展览馆艺术形象。
    设计固然重要，那总还不过是一张图纸，关键却在通过装饰雕塑家、装饰美术家、装饰工人的双手使设计成为具体的东西。一件美术装饰物的完成，设计只能算是做了全部工作的一半，另外一半还要依靠这些同志。从制作加工的角度来看，图纸往往只能帮助说明建筑师的意图，提供给装饰雕塑家、装饰美术家和装饰工人作为参考，建筑装饰能否获得优美的效果，还是决定于这些同志的再次创造。依样葫芦描摩图纸因而产生种种缺陷，那么应该说是装饰雕塑家、装饰美术家或装饰工人的过错。建筑是综合艺术，建筑师不可能包办代替所有这些人的工作，这就需要大家真诚的合作。认为装饰雕塑家、装饰美术家、装饰工人只是秉承建筑师的意旨做事，根本谈不上什么创作的错误想法，曾经受到安德列耶夫、凯丝诺娃同志的严正批判。苏联展览馆建筑装饰能有今天这样令人满意的成绩，是和苏联专家从这方面给我们的帮助分不开的。
    苏联展览馆美术装饰物种类很多，要求制作加工的条件也很严格。开始，我们断定许多设计由于缺乏有经验的技术工人和现代的生产装备不可在中国实现，希望在莫斯科解决。这种想法得到了苏联专家及时纠正。他带着我们跑遍了北京市公营特种工艺工厂和手工作坊，进行了解，发现许多在金属铸造和攒铜技术上造诣很高的民间艺人。虽然他们对自己熟悉的业务荒废已久，多年没有做过花活，透过保存的年轻时代的作品，还可隐约看到他们被尘封的智慧。有一天，当你看到嵌在金塔中央台座上面的苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟，和悬挂在门前广场上的苏联十六个加盟共和国国徽的时候，当你看到中央大厅金光灿然、五色缤纷的嵌花玻璃的时候，当你在莫斯科餐厅的柱子上看到那群神形毕肖、栩栩如生的铜鸟铜兽的时候，你将被他们惊人的创作天才所感动。过去以为不能做的我们的工人同志把它全做出来了，而且做得又快又好。这里我不禁想起了安德烈耶夫同志最初对我讲的话：“从前他们没有做过这样大的东西，开始也许做不好，因此就不信赖他们，不给他们创作的机会，什么时候才让他们动手来做？什么时候中国的建筑装饰工艺才能不依靠别的国家自己发展起来？”对于一个设计人员来说，这些话都是十分重要的。不知道发掘蕴藏在民间的无穷无尽的创造潜力，不知道启发和鼓励工艺技师大胆发挥自己的创造智慧，以为一切没有办法，只好指望别人帮助或者因陋就简的思想，是挡在装饰艺术发展道途当中的砾石，大家动手把它搬掉。
    我们得到苏联建筑师安德烈耶夫、凯丝诺娃和施工专家普洛多切夫同志无私的帮助，依靠装饰雕塑家、装饰美术家和装饰工人创造性劳动，优越地完成了苏联展览馆全部装饰工程。他们的功绩，得到了设计人员出自内心的感谢，也将博得所有参观的人们热情赞赏。
