Watching Performances by Vietnamese Artists
Wang Guangbin

In Viet Bac, there are overlapping mountains, dense jungles, winding streams, and orchards bearing abundant fruits everywhere. In a small mountain village, I had the opportunity to see the artistic performances of artists from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and to meet Vietnamese literary and art circles friends such as: poet To Huu, composer Van Cao, and literary history researcher Tran Huy Lieu.

After watching the performances of the Vietnamese artists, everyone will understand that the revolutionary will of the Vietnamese people is invincible. We cannot forget the song and dance drama "Advancing to the Northwest," which was adapted from popular dances and folk songs of various ethnic groups in the Northwest region. The actors first sang:

	"High mountains,
	Green waters,
	White clouds floating overhead,
	Involuntarily reminded of our lovely hometown.
	Since the French soldiers came,
	Taxes and levies numbered in the thousands,
	Rape, plunder, conscription, and forced labor,
	The joyful village,
	Has since turned into barren mountains.
	How many leaves are in the forest,
	We have that much hatred."

The Vietnamese people have experienced a long period of tragic life, and finally, under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and President Ho Chi Minh, they have carried out the struggle for the peace, unification, independence, and democracy of the motherland, and have achieved one victory after another. In the song and dance drama, they enthusiastically sing about fighting, singing about the Vietnamese People's Army liberating the Northwest region:

	"The red flag is fluttering,
	The mountains and rivers are also singing.
	Dear army,
	Brought us back the land,
	Brought beauty back to the mountains and rivers."

The heroic deeds created by the Vietnamese people in the war of resistance are the main themes praised by Vietnamese artists. Heroes like Hoang Quoc Viet-style hero La Van Cau, Lone-dare hero Nguyen Quoc Tri, and Giap Van Khang, have all been praised in various forms of literary and artistic works. The indomitable struggle story of the heroine Nguyen Thi Suot has been adapted into a three-act opera. Nguyen Thi Suot was the daughter of a poor peasant, whose parents both died at the hands of landlords. When the French colonialists began to launch the war, this fourteen-year-old girl joined the guerrillas. She grew up in the war, as brave as a tiger when fighting, as agile as an eagle when contacting others, and usually she was also an expert in farming and harvesting. Once, when escorting the Party Committee Secretary through a French military stronghold, she cleverly helped the Party Committee Secretary to escape, while she herself was unfortunately captured. She endured all kinds of torture, stubbornly refusing to utter a word, and finally escaped imprisonment and returned to the guerrillas. Under her and her comrades' active work, the guerrilla force grew from two or three hundred people to three or four thousand people. Nguyen Thi Suot, this glorious Labor Party member, and excellent daughter of the Vietnamese people, became a national hero.

The three-act opera "Vu Ca Ngam" depicts the story of Vu Ca Ngam, a Hmong ethnic hero from Bu Long village in Dien Bien district, Lai Chau province, and his family, who undertook liaison and cover work in extremely difficult circumstances. Once, when the French army came to clear the countryside, they hid the cadres they were protecting in the forest. The French army surrounded his house and forced them to hand over the cadres. He, his mother, two younger brothers, and a little sister, all endured all kinds of severe torture, and none of them revealed a word, until the whole family was shot in front of the gate, they calmly shouted "Long live President Ho Chi Minh!"

Vietnamese artists reproduce the deeds of these heroes on the stage with a high degree of respect, educating and inspiring the broad masses of people and soldiers.

In this art performance, we also came into contact with Vietnamese folk art.

In the Vietnamese countryside, beautiful folk songs and ballads are circulated everywhere. At night, when the moon hangs high in the sky, young men and women often sit around and sing to each other. Among the girls, the most beautiful and intelligent one is chosen to lead the singing; among the young men, a respected person who can answer is also chosen to lead the singing. For example, the man sings: "Yu Ping Mountain is round and oblique in front, An Jiu River is clear, rain is turbid, how beautiful is my sister, I wonder what kind of lover you want to choose?" The woman replies: "I don't love money and beauty, I only love unchanging heart for a lifetime. Don't be like a rabbit in front of the mountain forest, loving shadows in the morning and the moon in the evening."

One of the most popular local operas in the Vietnamese countryside is called "Cheo". This is an informal song and dance drama, and many of the lyrics are also six-eight poems (the first sentence has six characters, and the second sentence has eight characters). In addition to the original tune, other various folk songs can also be put in. The content mostly reflects rural life, and some satirize the bad habits and customs of the old society. Peasants gather to perform during festivals.

A kind of ancient opera called "Tuong" is also circulating in the countryside. This is a type of drama similar to Chinese Cantonese opera. The repertoires are mostly stories from the Chinese "Romance of the Three Kingdoms", such as "Three Heroes Battle Lu Bu", "Flooding the Seven Armies", "Three Angers of Zhou Yu", etc., and also stories from "Water Margin", "Journey to the West", and "Eastern Zhou Dynasty". In the "Tuong" repertoire, there are also many that depict outstanding national heroes in Vietnamese history.

Vietnamese literary and art circles friends told us: Chinese classical literary works, such as: "Dream of the Red Chamber", "Romance of the Three Kingdoms", "Water Margin", "Journey to the West", "Eastern Zhou Dynasty", etc., are also quite widely circulated among the Vietnamese people. As President Ho Chi Minh said, China and Vietnam are "culturally connected." We see that every Spring Festival, people paste Spring Festival couplets. Every Dragon Boat Festival, people eat zongzi and row dragon boats. Every Mid-Autumn Festival, people eat moon cakes and worship the moon. The twenty-four solar terms of the year are also the same.

In the extremely difficult environment of the war of resistance, many works by modern Chinese writers were translated into Vietnamese, such as Zhao Shuli's "Changes in Li Village", Liu Baiyu's "Firelight in Front", Wang Li's "Sunny Day", etc., which were warmly loved by the Vietnamese people; Films such as "The White Haired Girl" and "Steel Soldier" were even more welcomed by the Vietnamese people. When "The White Haired Girl" was shown, soldiers and peasants were often moved to tears because they had experienced the same or even deeper suffering as the Chinese peasants.

Vietnamese literature and art will achieve greater development and achievements in the struggle for peaceful unification, independence, and democracy.

    看越南文艺工作者的表演
    王光彬
    在越北，到处是重叠的山峦，茂密的丛林，蜿蜒的溪流，到处是结着丰硕果实的果树园。在一个小小山村里，我有机会看到越南民主共和国文艺工作者们的艺术表演，同时会见到越南文艺界的朋友们：诗人素友，作曲家文高和文学史研究家陈辉?等同志。
    看了越南文艺工作者们的表演，人人都会懂得，越南人民的革命意志是不可战胜的。我们不能忘怀歌舞剧“进军西北”，那是根据西北地区各民族流行的舞蹈和民歌编写的。演员们首先唱着：
      “高高的山，
    绿绿的水，
    白云在头上飘荡，
    不由得想起可爱的家乡。
    自从来了法国大兵，
    苛捐杂税成千累万，
    奸淫掳掠抓兵派伕，
    欢乐的村庄，
    从此变成了荒山。
    森林里有多少树叶，
    我们就有多少仇恨。”
    越南人民经历了长时期的悲惨生活，终于在越南劳动党、越南民主共和国政府和胡志明主席的领导下，进行了争取祖国和平、统一、独立和民主的斗争，并取得一个又一个的胜利。在歌舞剧里。他们热情地歌唱战斗，歌唱越南人民军解放西北地区：
      “红旗在飘荡，
    山河也欢唱。
    亲爱的军队，
    给我们带回了土地，
    给山河带回了美丽。”
    越南人民在抗战中所创造的英雄事迹，是越南文艺工作者们歌颂的主要题材。黄继光式的英雄罗文求，独胆英雄阮国治、甲文康，都被采用各种形式的文艺作品歌颂着。女英雄阮氏羶的不屈的斗争故事，被编成了三场歌剧。阮氏羶是一个贫农的女儿，双亲都死在地主手里。当法国殖民者开始发动战争的时候，这个十四岁的姑娘，便参加了游击队。她在战争中长大了，作战时像老虎一样勇猛，联络时像神鹰一样机灵，平时她还是耕种收割的能手。在一次护送党委书记穿过法军据点时，她机智地使党委书记得以走脱，而她自己不幸被俘。她忍受着一切酷刑，始终顽强地一字不吐，终于逃脱了监禁，回到了游击队。在她和战友们的积极工作之下，游击队从二三百人发展到三四千人。阮氏羶，这个光荣的劳动党党员，越南人民优秀的女儿，便成为全国闻名的英雄。
    三场歌剧“武歌吟”，是描写莱州省奠边县布隆村的苗族英雄武歌吟和他的全家，他们在极艰苦的环境下担任着联络和掩护工作。一次，当法军来清乡时，他们把掩护的干部藏在森林里。法军包围了他的家，逼迫他们交出干部。他和他的母亲、两个弟弟和一个小妹妹，都忍受了一切严刑拷打，五个人一句话都没有透露，直至全家被枪毙在大门前，他们还从容地高呼着“胡志明主席万岁”！
    越南文艺工作者以高度崇敬的心情将这些英雄们的事迹重现在舞台上，教育和鼓舞了广大的人民和战士。
    在这次艺术表演中，我们也接触了越南的民间艺术。
    在越南的农村里，到处流传着优美的民歌民谣。在夜晚，月亮高挂在天空的时候，青年男女们常常围坐起来对唱。在姑娘中间，推一个最漂亮最聪明的出来领唱；在青年男子中，也推一个能够对答的有威望的人来领唱。比如，男的唱：“御坪山前圆后斜，安旧江晴浊雨清，妹妹生得多么标致，不知你要选择哪样的情人？”女的对答：“不爱金钱和美貌，只爱终身不变心。莫要像山林前的兔子，朝爱影子晚爱月亮。”
    在越南农村中最流行的一种地方戏叫做“娇”。这是一种不拘形式的歌舞剧，歌词很多也是六八诗（前一句六个字，后一句八个字）。调子除了本调外，其他各种各式的民歌也可以装进去。内容大都是反映农村生活的，也有的是讽刺旧社会的恶习和陋俗的。农民们每到年节时，便集会表演。
    在农村中还流传着一种古戏叫“端”。这是一种类似中国的粤剧的剧种，剧目也大都是中国的“三国演义”上的故事，如“三英战吕布”、“水淹七军”、“三气周瑜”等，也有“水浒”、“西游记”、“东周列国志”上的故事。在“端”的剧目中，也有许多是描写越南历史上出色的民族英雄的。
      越南文艺界的朋友们告诉我们：中国的古典文学作品，如：“红楼梦”、“三国演义”、“水浒”、“西游记”、“东周列国志”等，也在越南人民中相当广泛地流传着。正如胡志明主席说过的，中越两国是“文化相通”的。我们看到每逢春节，人们要贴春联。每逢端午节，人们要吃粽子，划龙船。每逢八月节，人们要吃月饼，敬月亮。一年二十四个节气，也是相同的。
    在十分艰苦的抗战环境中，中国现代作家的作品，许多被翻译成了越文，如赵树理的“李家庄的变迁”、刘白羽的“火光在前”、王力的“晴天”等，受到了越南人民的热烈喜爱；“白毛女”、“钢铁战士”等影片，更受到越南人民的欢迎。“白毛女”放映时，常常有战士、农民感动得流泪，因为他们遭遇过和中国农民同样的或是更深的痛苦。
      越南的文学艺术将在为和平统一、独立和民主的斗争中获得更大的发展和成就。
