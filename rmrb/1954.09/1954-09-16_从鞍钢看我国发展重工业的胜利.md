    Seeing the Victory of China's Development of Heavy Industry from Anshan Iron and Steel
    Shao Xianghua, Representative of the National People's Congress, Head of the Technology Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company
    I am a technical worker engaged in steel production and came to Anshan after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. In the past eight years, I have seen how Anshan Iron and Steel was paralyzed and died under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang; I have also seen how Anshan Iron and Steel was revived and grown after returning to the hands of the people.
    In old China, how many people dreamed of developing industry. Many naive technical workers were superstitious about "industrial salvation," thinking they could save China's backwardness with their limited industrial knowledge. At that time, we did not know what hindered the development of industry; we did not know that industrial development was only possible after overthrowing the old social system and establishing a new social system. Therefore, many beautiful dreams of "industrial salvation" all ended in disillusionment. I myself had three such dreams. The first time was on the eve of the Anti-Japanese War. I participated in the work of the Central Iron and Steel Plant of the pseudo-Resources Committee. At that time, I ordered steel plant machinery from Germany, but due to the consistent traitorous policy of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary government, the road for Japanese imperialism to invade the whole of China was cleared. Not long after the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the planned site of the Central Iron and Steel Plant was occupied by the Japanese invaders, and the entire plan was abandoned. The second time was during the Anti-Japanese War. I was sent to Sichuan to prepare for a steel plant, which only had a fifteen-ton open-hearth furnace. It took more than three years to barely start operation, but at that time, semi-colonial old China did not and could not have large-scale construction. The need for construction steel was originally limited, and the import of imperialist steel overwhelmed domestic products. Therefore, as soon as a little steel was produced, the problem of sales was immediately discovered, and work was soon stopped. The third time was after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, when I was sent to Anshan. At that time, I thought I could really accomplish something this time, but after the Kuomintang reactionaries came to Northeast China, their primary task was not to restore industrial production, but to engage in looting and fortune-making. Various agencies everywhere rushed to affix seals, and corrupt officials and bureaucrats desperately sold equipment. In Lishan, near the Anshan Iron and Steel plant site, an open market for selling coal and iron appeared. Bureaucrats, private merchants, hooligans, and thieves devoured Anshan Iron and Steel. Large and small KMT army officers brought arms and openly used cars to rob various equipment. At the same time, they were also busy carrying out an anti-people civil war. As a result, Anshan Iron and Steel spent more than a year barely restoring the production of one open-hearth furnace. The blast furnace was not opened at all, and the coking furnace stopped working because it could not push out coke. Finally, due to problems with raw materials and funding, everything was shut down. Facts have proved that under the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, it is fundamentally impossible to develop industry, especially heavy industry.
    After the founding of New China, Anshan Iron and Steel, which had been ravaged by the Kuomintang reactionaries, returned to the hands of the people and gained new life. Now the annual output of Anshan Iron and Steel's main products, pig iron and steel ingots, has greatly exceeded the highest annual output during the Japanese occupation, and the steel produced by each rolling mill has reached 2.8 to 3.4 times the highest output of the puppet Manchurian regime. With the successive adoption of Soviet state standards in recent years, the quality of products has also greatly improved. Many high-quality products that could not be produced domestically before, such as 43 kg steel rails and fishplates, No. 30 channel steel and many other large and small sections, seamless steel pipes of various compositions and diameters, high-alumina bricks, chrome-magnesia bricks, and other advanced refractory materials, are now produced in large quantities and supplied to various places.
    The Communist Party has repeatedly pointed out to us that to rapidly change China's backwardness and poverty, to meet the people's growing material and cultural needs, and to strengthen our national defense, we must have a strong industrial base, and to establish this industrial base, we must first establish a strong heavy industrial base. We, who work in the motherland's first iron and steel base, deeply realize the greatness and correctness of the Party's policy. In the past few years, Anshan Iron and Steel's steel has been widely supplied to all parts of the country, supporting the construction of huge railway projects, power transmission line projects, and water conservancy projects such as the Huai River and Jingjiang River flood diversion, produced various new agricultural implements, and continuously supplied a large amount of steel to important new and expanded enterprises in various places.
    The great achievements of Anshan Iron and Steel in recent years are also due to our conscientious implementation of the Party's policy of learning from the Soviet Union, giving play to the initiative and creativity of the working class, and the support of the whole country.
    Chairman Mao called on us to learn from the Soviet Union. Many technical and business management innovations at Anshan Iron and Steel have been successful through learning from the Soviet Union, accepting suggestions from Soviet experts, and implementing them through the efforts of employees. For example, during the puppet Manchurian regime, ironmaking mainly used natural rich ore as raw material, and magnetic separation, sintering, and pelletizing methods were used to make artificial rich ore from lean ore as supplementary raw material. According to the backward European and American experience and theory, they believed that blast furnaces could not operate smoothly with too much sintered ore. The operation process they adopted was unreasonable for the Northeast, where lean iron ore resources were extremely large and rich ore was relatively small. They also believed that pig iron smelted from Anshan's raw materials could not have low silicon content. Therefore, many pre-refining furnaces were built in the steel plant to pre-treat the molten iron once before entering the open-hearth furnace to remove excess silicon. This resulted in more furnaces in the steel plant but less steel production, which was a very uneconomical method. Now, under the suggestion and specific guidance of Soviet experts, we have improved the production capacity and quality of sintered ore, increased the proportion of sintered ore in ironmaking raw materials, smelted standard steelmaking pig iron suitable for direct steelmaking, and converted all pre-refining furnaces into open-hearth furnaces. The direct steelmaking method was adopted. This greatly improved steel production capacity, increased labor productivity, and reduced the cost of steel. This is a series of the most important reforms in Anshan's technology.
    In the past few years, we have also learned a lot of Soviet business management experience, ensuring normal production order and establishing a foundation for continuous improvement of productivity. The construction and production of new factories such as the newly completed large rolling mill, seamless steel pipe plant, and second thin plate plant are even more inseparable from Soviet economic and technical assistance.
    The liberated working class has demonstrated a high degree of labor enthusiasm and creativity in the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel. In the early stage of resumption of work, the workers tried every means to find the lost equipment necessary for the resumption of work at that time, so that the incomplete equipment left over from the Kuomintang rule could be put back into production in a short time. In 1952, mass movements such as rationalization proposals, summarizing and popularizing advanced experience, and labor competitions were enthusiastically launched. Comrade Zhang Mingshan of the small rolling mill, under the leadership of the Party and with the support of the workers, created the anti-circumferential disc, which not only improved the production capacity of the rolling mill equipment but also freed the workers from the dangerous working conditions left over from the old enterprise. The Party promptly pointed out the great significance of this initiative and led the workers to launch a technical innovation movement. This movement quickly spread to all factories, mines, and basic construction sites. Thousands of suggestions related to improving technology emerged from the vast number of workers and technicians. Many factories and mines improved outdated equipment and harsh and heavy labor conditions, significantly increasing the output and quality of products.
    The support of the whole country for Anshan Iron and Steel is also a decisive factor in the achievements made by Anshan Iron and Steel in production and construction in recent years. In the past few years, the Party has transferred thousands of outstanding cadres and engineering and technical personnel from all over the country, greatly strengthening the production and construction team of Anshan Iron and Steel. Factories in various places rushed to produce equipment for Anshan Iron and Steel, so that the restoration and expansion projects of Anshan Iron and Steel could receive the necessary spare parts in a timely manner. In addition, scientific research institutions and academic institutions have also given us a lot of help. Some of our production technology innovations, such as the trial production of high-alumina bricks, the improvement of the quality of heavy rail steel and No. 3 steel, the research on open-hearth furnace bottoms, and the increase in chemical by-products, have been successful through cooperation with various research institutes of the Academy of Sciences.
    In the next few years of the first five-year plan, in order to meet the needs of the motherland's socialist industrialization, Anshan Iron and Steel will have many new factories to be built and put into production. The scale of these projects will be many times larger than those completed in the past few years, and higher technical levels are required in construction and production. The tasks before us are very arduous. However, past experience has undoubtedly proved to us that the wise leadership of the Party, the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, the infinite enthusiasm and creativity of the entire working class under the Party's cultivation and education, and the continued support of the people of the whole country will all be reliable guarantees for completing these tasks. The same conditions will also enable other heavy industrial bases as huge as Anshan Iron and Steel to be established and developed rapidly. The victory of Anshan Iron and Steel makes us clearly see the bright future of the motherland's heavy industry development and the beautiful vision of the motherland's socialist industrialization.

    从鞍钢看我国发展重工业的胜利
    全国人民代表大会代表  鞍山钢铁公司技术处处长  邵象华
    我是一个从事钢铁生产的技术工作者，抗日战争胜利后就来到鞍山。八年来，我看到了鞍钢在国民党反动统治下如何由瘫痪而死亡；也看到了鞍钢回到人民手中后又如何复活和成长。
    在旧中国，曾有多少人做过发展工业的梦。许多天真的技术工作者迷信着“工业救国”，满想凭自己的一点工业知识来挽救中国的落后。那时我们不知道什么东西是发展工业的障碍；不知道必须推翻旧的社会制度，建立新的社会制度后，发展工业才有可能。因此很多“工业救国”的美梦，统统都归幻灭。我自己就做过三次这样的美梦。第一次是抗战前夕，我参加了伪资源委员会中央钢铁厂的工作，当时曾向德国订了钢铁厂的机器，但是由于蒋介石反动政府一贯的卖国政策，给日本帝国主义扫清了侵略全中国的道路，抗日战争爆发不久，中央钢铁厂的预定厂址被日寇占领，整个计划就此作罢。第二次是在抗日战争时期，我被派在四川筹办一个炼钢厂，仅仅只有一座十五吨的平炉，足足花了三年多的时间才勉强开工，但当时半殖民地的旧中国没有也不可能有大规模的建设，建筑钢材的需要本来有限，加以帝国主义钢材入口压倒了本国出品，所以出了一点点钢，马上就发现销路成问题，不久也就停工。第三次是抗日战争胜利以后，我被派到鞍山，那时满以为这回可以真正干出一番事业来了，但国民党反动派来到东北后，首要的事并不是恢复工业生产，而是忙于发劫收财，各机关到处抢贴封条，贪官污吏拚命盗卖器材，在鞍钢厂址近旁的立山，就出现了盗卖煤铁的公开市场。官僚、私商、流氓、小偷吞噬着鞍钢，国民党军队的大小军官带了武装，公然用汽车大车劫取各种器材。他们同时还忙着进行反人民的内战。结果鞍钢花了一年多的时间，仅仅勉强恢复了一座平炉的生产，炼铁炉根本没有开，炼焦炉开炉因推不出焦而停工，最后由于原料经费都成问题，又全部停工。事实证明，在帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的反动统治下，发展工业，尤其是重工业，根本是不可能的。
    新中国成立后，被国民党反动派摧残得奄奄一息的鞍钢回到了人民的手里，获得了新的生命。现在鞍钢的主要产品，生铁和钢锭的年产量都已大大超过日本占领时期的最高年产量，各轧钢厂出产的钢材达到了伪满最高产量的二点八至三点四倍。随着几年来陆续采用了苏联国家标准，产品的质量也大有提高。许多以前在国内不能生产的高质量产品，如四十三公斤的钢轨和鱼尾板，三十号槽钢和其他许多大小型钢，各种成份和口径的无缝钢管，高炉砖、铬镁砖等高级耐火材料等等，现在都大量生产供应各地。
    共产党一再向我们指出：要迅速改变中国的落后和贫困状态，满足人民日益增长着的物质与文化生活的需要，和加强我们的国防力量，必须要有一个强大的工业基础，而为了建立这个工业基础，又必须首先建立起强大的重工业基础。我们在祖国第一个钢铁基地工作的人，深切地体会到党这个方针的伟大和正确。几年来，鞍钢的钢铁广泛地供应了全国各地，支援了巨大的铁路工程、输电线工程，和淮河、荆江分洪等水利工程的建设，制成了各种新式农具，并源源供应给各地新建和扩建的重要企业以大量的钢材。
    鞍钢几年来所以获得巨大成就，还因为我们认真执行了党所指示的学习苏联、发挥工人阶级的积极性创造性的方针，以及得到了全国的支援。
    毛主席号召我们学习苏联。鞍钢许许多多技术上的以及企业管理上的革新，都是学习苏联，接受苏联专家建议，经过职工努力贯彻而成功的。例如伪满时炼铁主要用天然富矿石为原料，另外用磁选及烧结和团矿的方法将贫矿石制成人造富矿，作为补充原料。根据欧美的落后经验和理论，他们认为高炉用过多的烧结矿是不能顺利操作的。他们所采用的操作过程，对于贫铁矿资源极大而富矿数量较少的东北，是不合理的。他们还认为用鞍山的原料炼出来的生铁含矽不可能低，因此在炼钢厂建造了不少预炼炉，将铁水在进平炉前预先处理一次，除去过剩的矽。这样就使炼钢厂的炉子多而产钢少，是很不经济的办法。现在，在苏联专家们的建议和具体指导下，我们提高了烧结矿的生产能力和质量，提高了炼铁原料中烧结矿的比例，炼成了适宜于直接炼钢的标准制钢生铁，将预炼炉全部改成了平炉，采用了直接炼钢法，这样就大大地提高了钢的生产能力，提高了劳动生产率，降低了钢的成本，这是鞍钢技术上的一系列最重大的改革。
    几年来我们还学习了很多苏联的企业管理经验，保证了正常的生产秩序，给不断提高生产力建立了基础。新近完成的大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂、第二薄板厂等全新工厂的建设和生产，更是和苏联的经济及技术援助分不开的。
    解放了的工人阶级在建设鞍钢中，表现了高度的劳动积极性和创造性。在复工初期，工人们想尽一切办法寻找当时复工所必需的散失器材，使得从国民党统治时期遗留下来的残缺设备能在很短的时间内重新投入生产。一九五二年热烈地开展了合理化建议，总结和推广先进经验以及劳动竞赛等群众运动。小型轧钢厂张明山同志在党的领导和职工群众支持下创造了反围盘，不但提高了轧钢设备的生产能力，而且使工人们摆脱了旧企业遗留下来的险恶的劳动条件。党及时地指出了这件创举的重大意义，领导职工展开了技术革新运动。这一运动迅速地扩展到所有的厂矿和基本建设工地，数以千计的有关改进技术的建议从广大的工人和技术人员中涌现出来，许多厂矿改进了陈旧的设备和恶劣笨重的劳动条件，显著地提高了产品的产量和质量。
    全国各地对鞍钢的支援，也是几年来鞍钢在生产建设中获得成就的决定性因素。几年来党从全国各地调来了数以千计的优秀干部和工程技术人员，大大地壮大了鞍钢的生产建设队伍。各地工厂为鞍钢赶制器材，使鞍钢的恢复和扩建工程能及时得到必要的备品。此外科学研究机关和学术机关也给了我们不少帮助。我们有些生产技术上的革新如高炉砖的试制、重轨钢和三号钢质量的提高、平炉炉底的研究、化工副产的提高等，都是和科学院的各研究所合作而获得成功的。
    在第一个五年计划的今后几年中，为了适合祖国社会主义工业化的需要，鞍钢还有许多新的工厂要建设起来，投入生产。这些工程的规模比几年来所完成的还要大许多倍，而且在建设和生产中需要更高的技术水平。摆在我们面前的任务是十分艰巨的。但是过去的经验无可置疑地向我们证明，党的英明领导，苏联的无私帮助，全体工人阶级在党的培养教育下发挥无穷的积极性和创造性，以及全国人民继续给予我们的支持，都将是完成这些任务的可靠保证。同样的这些条件，也将使和鞍钢同样巨大的其他重工业基地能够迅速地建立和发展。鞍钢的胜利使我们清楚地看到祖国重工业发展的光明前途，看到祖国社会主义工业化的美丽远景。
