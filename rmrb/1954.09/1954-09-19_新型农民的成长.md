    The Growth of a New Type of Farmer
    Zhao Xianbin
    When I heard the news that several farmers – Li Shunda, Shen Jilan, and others – had been elected, I immediately thought of the touching deeds I knew about them, and the activities of the farmers in their villages creating a new life; once again, it filled me with excitement. In our country, it is not strange for working farmers to become representatives of the National People's Congress. However, it is quite remarkable for a small village to produce two representatives to the National People's Congress.

    Not Bowing to Difficulties!
    I remember it was in September of 1952, during the autumn harvest, that I went to the hometown of Li Shunda and Shen Jilan – Xigou Village – with the local high-yield comparison visiting group.

    The farmers of Xigou Village told us a story about "Li Shunda Moving House":
    In the spring of 1951, the Ping shun County People's Government called on agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups in each village to formulate plans for increasing production. Li Shunda and the farmers of the whole village began to worry. They all felt that the grain yield had already increased from 182 jin per mu before the War of Resistance Against Japan to 370 jin; they had done what the Party and the government called for: "organizing", intensive cultivation, warm soup soaking, agent mixing, and the use of new-style farm tools; to increase production further was impossible. Therefore, Li Shunda, on behalf of the farmers of the whole village, put forward a "relocation plan" to the government.

    In the autumn of 1951, when Li Shunda was arranging the relocation, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference invited him to attend the meeting as a non-voting delegate. When Chairman Mao was eating at the same table with Li Shunda, he asked him with concern:
      "Are you Li Shunda from Shanxi Province?"
    "Yes, that's me," Li Shunda replied happily, standing up.
    "You're in a tough spot in the Taihang Mountains, yet you've achieved such great results. Come, let me offer you a toast!"
    "I wouldn't dare, Chairman Mao, if it weren't for your leadership, I wouldn't be where I am today!"

    Afterwards, Li Shunda pondered: What remarkable thing have I done? Chairman Mao respects me so much. The past events appeared before his eyes one by one: from an ordinary farmer to becoming a glorious Communist Party member; from a poor tenant farmer to becoming a national agricultural labor model; from leading rent reduction and interest rate reduction, developing production, and supporting the front lines, to the current "relocation." "Relo-cation," he hesitated and thought about it emphatically, and then he thought of what Chairman Mao said to him: "You're in a tough spot in the Taihang Mountains, yet you've achieved such great results..." "Tough... achievements... relocation..." The more he thought about it, the more he felt something was wrong. "Wrong!" Finally, he came to such a conclusion. He couldn't help but feel ashamed and said to himself, "Chairman Mao! I'm sorry for your praise; I've bowed to the difficult environment of the Taihang Mountains."

    When Li Shunda realized that "relocation" was wrong, he asked the responsible comrades of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government what to do. The responsible comrades of the Ministry of Agriculture suggested to him: it is necessary to develop agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry in an all-round way in accordance with the characteristics of the mountainous areas. After returning to the village, the Ping shun County Committee of the Communist Party of China helped them to make a three-year plan for the all-round development of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. According to this plan, the income of the farmers in the whole village will be doubled in three years. Since then, the farmers of Xigou Village began to recognize the direction of development in mountainous areas, and their enthusiasm for production rose again. At the same time, it also pointed out the direction of efforts for farmers in mountainous areas.

    The Growth of Collectivist Thought
    Why can Li Shunda always maintain the glorious title of labor model?
    "I don't have any special advantages, but I just accept the leadership of the Party, listen to the criticisms of the masses, and am not selfish," Li Shunda gave such a humble answer.

    I learned about some fragments of examples:
    At the first Taihang District Labor Model Congress in 1944, because Li Shunda led the farmers of Xigou Village in producing to overcome famine and supporting the front lines, the Taihang Administrative Office awarded him a large ox. This ox was used for pulling carts on the plains and could not cultivate the land in the mountains. He exchanged this ox for a small cow; with the money he made up, he bought a sow, preparing to breed piglets. After hearing about this incident, the members of the mutual aid group raised their opinions, saying that the achievements were made by everyone, and it was inappropriate for him to dispose of the award at will.

    After hearing this reflection, Li Shunda felt that the opinions raised by the group members were very correct. He thought: If it weren't for everyone's efforts, how could I have become a labor model and won the award? He then convened a meeting of mutual aid group members to study how to deal with this problem. After Li Shunda made a review, he proposed a solution: The small cow should be raised and used by those who do not have livestock. The calves bred belong to the person who raises them, and the cow ultimately belongs to the mutual aid group; if the sow gives birth to piglets, each group member will be given a piglet. All the group members agreed.

    In 1946, he continued to be named a labor model in the Taihang District, and the administrative office awarded him another ox; this time, he unhesitatingly regarded this ox as the common property of the whole group.

    In the spring of 1953, the cooperative and Li Shunda's family had to build houses, and the adobe bricks were made in the same place. It rained, and Li Shunda's wife, Lü Guilan, found a few mats to cover her own bricks. Li Shunda came back from the field and saw that his bricks were covered, but the cooperative's bricks were not covered, so he hurried home to find something to cover them; the mats in the house were used up, and the rain was still pouring down. If he went to look for them elsewhere, the cooperative's bricks would be in danger of being damaged by the rain. He readily took off the mats covering his own bricks and covered the cooperative's bricks.

    Growing Up With the Masses
    Li Shunda is growing. Not only is his socialist thought growing, but his ability to produce high yields is growing, and his ability to lead agricultural production cooperatives is also growing. These have already been proven in the deeds of his winning the Patriotic High-Yield Gold Star Medal and in the fact that the agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperative he leads is becoming more and more consolidated and expanding. What is particularly noteworthy is that Li Shunda is not only growing himself, but also growing up with the masses. The growth of Shen Jilan is inseparable from Li Shunda's patient cultivation and help, and it is also inseparable from the progress of the farmers in Xigou Village.

    When we went to Xigou Village in 1952, Comrade Li Shunda had gone to the Soviet Union to visit and was not at home. The person who received us was a young woman. At that time, there were three most important tasks to be done in the village: rushing the autumn harvest; preparing for the distribution of the harvest; and introducing the experience of high yields to the visiting group. This young rural woman, acting on behalf of Comrade Li Shunda, organized all the cadres and the masses in the cooperative to handle these affairs in an orderly manner. She is Shen Jilan, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch of Xigou Village and the deputy director of the agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperative.

    The meeting to introduce the high-yield experience to the visiting group began. Comrade Shen Jilan introduced the high-yield experience of that year to the visitors. In her report, she talked about their achievements, as well as the difficulties they had encountered and the ways to solve them; the visitors called listening to this report "getting the scripture." However, the visitors were not satisfied and asked to hear about their leadership experience.

    "The achievements are all made by everyone, and we have no leadership experience," Comrade Shen Jilan gave such a humble answer.

    Everyone repeatedly asked her "not to be polite," and she said, "I am responsible for leading women's production in the cooperative. Let's talk about the situation of producing with women!"

    Labor is a Glorious Thing
    Comrade Shen Jilan said that she had been thinking about such a question for a long time: How many years have we been striving for equality between men and women, why is it not completely equal yet? Under the education of the Party, Shen Jilan understood that only by participating in labor well can we achieve a completely equal status.

    As soon as the agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperative was established, Li Shunda thought: If the cooperative is not mobilized for women to participate in production, it is like a car missing a wheel. To mobilize women, we must first cultivate women's backbones. He brought his opinion to the Party branch meeting for discussion, and everyone agreed that cultivating Shen Jilan was the most appropriate. From then on, Li Shunda and the branch committee members regarded cultivating Shen Jilan as an important task. Shen Jilan was elected as the deputy director at the cooperative members' meeting.

    Shen Jilan first united with Lü Guilan, Zhang Xuehua, and several other women who actively worked, and jointly mobilized 19 women to participate in production in the fields, opening up the situation for women to participate in agricultural labor.

    The cooperative originally stipulated that women participating in labor could earn up to half a work day a day. Shen Jilan proposed the suggestion of equal pay for equal work for men and women, which was rejected by most of the male members at that time. Shen Jilan hit this snag, and her belief in participating in labor to strive for complete equality wavered again.

    Seeing Shen Jilan's depressed mood, Comrade Song Jinshan, the organizing committee member of the Party branch, encouraged her: "Jilan, don't be discouraged! The principle you put forward is correct. However, you have rarely participated in major labor before, and the male members don't believe you can be better than them. You should first set an example. If you have any difficulties, I will teach you."

    The work of thinning seedlings in the spring began. The female members were skillful and thinned them especially quickly. The male members were so tired that they didn't even have time to smoke, and they still fell behind the three female members. When it came to scoring and recording work points in the evening, Shen Jilan led the female members to argue on the basis of reason. As a result of the evaluation, each of the three leading female members was given 11 points; the male member with the most points was only 10 points. Their confidence rose again...

    Labor has given women in Xigou Village a completely equal status; it has made a large number of more harmonious families appear in Xigou Village.

    Shen Jilan did not think about obtaining any honor when leading women in production, but just wanted to do what she should do. However, in our country, honor has eyes, Shen Jilan did not pursue honor, but honor found her. In the winter of 1952, she was selected as an agricultural labor model.

    Not Complacent, Moving Forward Again!
    Li Shunda and Shen Jilan are not complacent at all. They are constantly progressing under the encouragement of collective power, and they are constantly progressing under the education of the masses. They not only unite and help each other in their work, but also promote each other in their thoughts and studies. Li Shunda often said to Shen Jilan: "If you hear any opinions from the masses about me, bring them up, and I will bring up any opinions from the masses about you. In this way, we can correct our shortcomings and run the cooperative well!" When the cooperative was first established, Li Shunda saw Shen Jilan crying when she hit a snag, so he said to her: "To be a leader, you have to be able to withstand setbacks! If the masses are right, do what the masses say; if they are not right, you can't cry either, you have to be generous." Later, Shen Jilan cried less and dared to do things boldly when something happened. During the autumn harvest last year, Li Shunda said to Shen Jilan: "Our educational level is low. If we want to run the cooperative well, we should strengthen our studies. You are younger than me, and you will learn faster than me. However, I don't want to fall behind you. In the future, we should both seize the time to study." Li Shunda studied on his own in the early morning, and Shen Jilan attended folk school in the evening. Every time they held a meeting, they always practiced taking notes. This spring, Shen Jilan was selected as a study model in the Changzhi area.

    The agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperative of Xigou Village is growing. It has developed from a dozen households and dozens of households to more than 200 households. The members are singing with confidence about the not-too-distant future of Xigou Village: "The mountains are green, the cows and sheep are all over the mountains; the cultivated land does not need cows, the lamps do not need oil; if you are not careful when walking, the apples will bruise your head."

    The farmers of Xigou Village are growing. Li Shunda and Shen Jilan grew up among the masses, and they led the masses of the whole village to make progress together. Their thoughts of taking the socialist road have become more firm, and touching stories of loving the country and loving the cooperative are constantly emerging. Under the leadership of the Communist Party branch and with the enthusiastic and patient help of Li Shunda and Shen Jilan, more farmers have become the backbone of the production cooperative. Now, there are more than 100 backbone members in the cooperative, 49 of whom are women.

    From the farmers of Xigou Village and from Li Shunda and Shen Jilan, we can see how a new type of farmer is growing in our country.

    新型农民的成长
    赵宪斌
    我听到了几位农民——李顺达、申纪兰等人当选的消息，立刻就又想到了我所了解的他们的那些动人的事迹、他们的村子里的农民群众创造新的生活的活动；又一次使我兴奋起来。在我们的国家里，劳动农民当了全国人民代表，并不是什么奇怪的事情。可是，一个小村子，出了两名全国人民代表大会的代表，这不能不说是一件不寻常的事情。
    不能向困难低头！
    记得还是在一九五二年的九月间，正在秋收的时候，我随同各地丰产评比参观团，到了李顺达、申纪兰的家乡——西沟村。
    西沟村的农民们给我们讲了一个“李顺达搬家”的故事：
    一九五一年的春季，平顺县人民政府号召各村农业生产合作社、互助组制订增产计划。李顺达和全村农民发起愁来了。他们都感到：粮食的产量，已由抗战前每亩产一百八十二斤，提高到了三百七十斤；党和政府号召的“组织起来”、精耕细作、温汤浸种、药剂拌种、使用新式农具都做到了；还要增产，无论如何是增不上去了。于是，李顺达便代表全村农民，向政府提出了一个“搬家计划”。
    一九五一年秋，李顺达正在安排搬家的时候，中国人民政治协商会议请他去列席会议，毛主席在和李顺达同桌吃饭的时候，关心地问他：
      “你是山西省的李顺达？”
    “是，我就是。”李顺达欢喜地站起来回答。
    “你在太行山那地方很苦，却做出这样大成绩。来，我敬你一杯酒！”
    “可不敢，毛主席，要不是你领导，我那有今天呀！”
    事后，李顺达寻思着：我做了什么了不起的事情呢？毛主席这样敬重我。过去的事情，一幕一幕出现在他眼前：从一个普通的农民，到成为光荣的共产党员；从一个贫苦的佃户，到成为全国农业劳动模范；从领导减租减息、发展生产、支援前线，到现在的“搬家”。“搬——家”，他迟疑地着重想了一下，又想到了毛主席对他说的：“你在太行山那地方很苦，却做出这样大成绩……”“很苦……成绩……搬家……”他前思后想，越想越不对劲。“不对！”终于他得出了这样一个结论。他忍不住惭愧地暗自说道：“毛主席！我对不起你的称道；我对太行山这个困难环境低头了。”
    当李顺达觉察到“搬家”不对了的时候，便问中央农业部的负责同志应该怎么办。农业部的负责同志向他建议：要按照山区的特点，农林牧全面发展。回村后，中共平顺县委员会又帮助他们作了一个农、林、牧全面发展的三年计划。按照这计划，全村农民的收入，三年后要提高一倍。从此，西沟村农民开始认清了山区发展方向，生产情绪又高起来了。同时，也给山区农民指出了努力的方向。
    集体主义思想的生长
    为什么李顺达能一直保持着劳动模范的光荣称号呢？
    “我也没有什么特殊的优点，只不过是接受了党的领导，听取了群众的批评，不自私。”李顺达作了这样一个谦虚的回答。
    我了解到这样一些片断的事例：
    在一九四四年太行区第一届劳动模范大会上，因李顺达领导西沟村农民生产渡荒、支援前线作出了显著成绩，太行行署奖给了他一条大犍牛。这条牛是平川拉车用的，不会在山上耕地。他便把这一条牛换成了一条小母牛；用补回来的钱，买了一条母猪，准备繁殖小猪。互助组员们听到这件事情后，就提出了意见，说成绩是大家做出来的，得了奖他随便支配不合适。
    李顺达听到这个反映后，觉得组员们提的意见很对。他想：如果没有大家的努力，我怎么会当了劳动模范，会得了奖？他便召集了一个互助组员会议，研究处理这个问题。李顺达作了检讨之后，提出了一个处理办法：把小母牛由没牲口的人喂养使用，繁殖了小牛，归喂养人所有，母牛最后归互助组所有；母猪下了小猪，给每个组员分一口小猪。全体组员都同意了。
    一九四六年他继续被评为太行区的劳动模范，行署又奖给他一条大犍牛；这一次，他毫不犹豫地把这条牛算作了全组公有的财产。
    一九五三年春天，合作社和李顺达自己家里都要盖房，在同一个地方打的土坯。天下雨了，李顺达的妻子吕桂兰，就找了几张席子盖上了自己的坯。李顺达从地里回来，看到自己的坯盖上了，社里的坯没有盖着，就急忙到家里去找盖的；家中的席子用光了，雨仍在猛下着，如果再到别处去找，合作社的坯就有被雨淋坏的危险。他顺手揭下自己坯上盖的席子，盖到了合作社的坯上。
    和群众一起成长起来
    李顺达在成长。不但社会主义思想在成长，丰产的本领在成长，领导农业生产合作社大家务的本领也在成长着。这些，在他荣获爱国丰产金星奖章的事迹中间，在他领导的农林畜牧生产合作社越来越巩固、扩大的事实中间，都已经证明了，这里不必多说。特别值得注意的是，李顺达不只是自己在成长，并且是和群众一起成长的。申纪兰的成长，就是同李顺达的耐心培养和帮助分不开的，也是同西沟村农民群众的进步分不开的。
    一九五二年我们到西沟村时，李顺达同志到苏联参观去了，没有在家。接待我们的是一个年轻妇女。当时，村上有最重要的三件工作要做：突击秋收；准备收获物的分配；向参观团介绍丰产经验。这个年轻的农村妇女，代行着李顺达同志的职责，组织全社干部和群众，有条不紊地处理着这些事务。她就是西沟村青年团支部书记、农林畜牧生产合作社副社长申纪兰。
    为参观团介绍丰产经验的会议开始了。申纪兰同志向参观者介绍了那年的丰产经验。她在报告中，谈到了他们的成绩，也谈了遇到过的困难和解决困难的办法；参观的人，把听取这次报告，都称做“取了经”。可是，参观者还不满足，还要求听一听他们的领导经验。
    “成绩都是大家做出来的，我们没有什么领导经验。”申纪兰同志作了这样一个谦虚的回答。
    大家一再请她“不要客气”，她才说：“我在社里分工负责领导妇女生产，咱就谈一谈和妇女一起生产的情形吧！”
    劳动是光荣的事情
    申纪兰同志说，她长期就考虑着这样一个问题：争取男女平等，争取了多少年了，为什么还没有完全平等呢？申纪兰在党的教育下，懂得了：只有好好地参加劳动，才能争取到完全平等的地位。
    农林畜牧生产合作社刚一成立，李顺达就想：办社不发动妇女参加生产，真好比车子缺了一个轮。要想发动妇女，就得先培养妇女骨干。他把他的意见提到党支部会上讨论，大家都认为培养申纪兰最合适。从那以后，李顺达和支部委员们都把培养申纪兰当做一个重要任务。申纪兰在社员大会上当选了副社长。
    申纪兰首先和吕桂兰、张雪花几个积极劳动的妇女，联合发动了十九个妇女，共同下地参加生产，打开了妇女参加农业劳动的局面。
    社里原来规定：妇女参加劳动，每天最多顶半个劳动日。申纪兰提出了男女同工同酬的建议，当时被多数男社员否决了。申纪兰碰了这个钉子，对参加劳动争取完全平等的信念，又动摇了。
    党支部组织委员宋金山同志看见申纪兰情绪消沉，便鼓励她：“纪兰，不要泄气！你提出的原则是对的。不过你们以前很少参加主要劳动，男社员们不相信你们能比得上他们，你们应该先做出样子来。你们有什么困难，我来教你们。”
    春季间苗工作开始了。女社员们手巧，间得特别快。男社员们累得连烟也顾不上吸，还是落到三个女社员的后面了。到晚上评分记工时，申纪兰便领导女社员据理力争。评的结果，给三个带头的女社员，每人评了十一分；男社员中得分最多的，才是十分。她们的信心又高涨起来。……
    劳动，使西沟村的妇女得到了完全平等的地位；使西沟村出现了大量更加和睦的家庭。
    申纪兰在领导妇女进行生产时，并没有想到获取什么荣誉，只是想要做自己应当做的事情。可是，在我们的国家里，荣誉是有眼睛的，申纪兰没有追求荣誉，荣誉却找到了她。在一九五二年冬，她被评选成了农业劳动模范。
    不自满，再前进！
    李顺达和申纪兰一点也没有自满。他们在集体的力量鼓舞下不断进步，在群众的教育下不断进步。他们不但在工作上团结、互助，而且在思想上、学习上也互相推动。李顺达常对申纪兰说：“你听到群众对我有什么意见，就提出来，我听到群众对你有什么意见也提出来。这样，咱们才能改正缺点，把社办好哩！”初建社时，李顺达看见申纪兰碰了钉子就哭，他就对她说：“当一个领导人，得经得起碰！群众说对了，就按群众意见办；不对，也不能哭，总得度量大才行。”以后，申纪兰就很少哭了，遇事敢大胆去做。去年秋收时，李顺达对申纪兰说：“咱俩文化程度都低，要想办好社，应该加强学习。你比我年青些，学起来比我快。可是，我不愿落你后，以后咱们都要抓紧时间学习才对。”李顺达清早自学，申纪兰晚上上民校学习。每次开会时，他们总要练习着记笔记。今年春天，申纪兰被选为长治专区的学习模范。
    西沟村的农林畜牧生产合作社在成长。它已经由十几户、几十户发展到二百多户了。社员们充满信心地歌唱着西沟村的不会很远的未来：“山上绿油油，牛羊满山沟；耕地不用牛，点灯不用油；走路不小心，苹果碰肿头。”
    西沟村的农民在成长。李顺达、申纪兰在群众中成长起来，又领导全村群众共同进步。他们走社会主义道路的思想已经更坚定了，爱国爱社的动人的事情不断出现。在共产党支部的领导下，在李顺达、申纪兰热情而耐心的帮助下，更多的农民变成了生产合作社里的骨干。现在，全社有一百多个骨干分子，其中有四十九个是妇女。
    从西沟村农民的身上，从李顺达、申纪兰的身上，我们可以看到：在我们的国家里，新型的农民是怎样在成长着。
