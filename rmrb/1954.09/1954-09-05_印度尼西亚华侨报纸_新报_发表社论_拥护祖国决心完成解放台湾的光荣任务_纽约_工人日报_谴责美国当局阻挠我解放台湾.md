Xinhua News Agency, September 4th: Jakarta News: The Indonesian Chinese newspaper "Xin Bao" published an editorial on August 27th entitled "Looking at the Liberation of Taiwan from the Perspective of OverseasChinese," supporting the joint declaration of all democratic parties and people's organizations of the People'sRepublic of China for the liberation of Taiwan. The editorial said: "The Chinese people are facing a glorious historical task, which is to liberate Taiwan." The editorial listed the facts of the persecution of overseas Chinese by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, which the Indonesian overseas Chinese personally experienced. The editorial pointed out that the Chiang bandit gang has been carrying out deceptive propaganda against overseas Chinese for several years,extorting overseas Chinese property, luring overseas Chinese youth to be cannon fodder, and sending special agents to persecute patriotic overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. Therefore, the liberation of Taiwan is the common demand of 12 million overseas Chinese. The editorial said: We have personally experienced that if the Taiwan traitorous clique is not eliminated, many overseas Chinese will continue to be deceived and extorted; if the Taiwan traitorous clique is not eliminated, the overseas Chinese community will not be peaceful, and overseas Chinese will continue to be persecuted by them. "The Chinese people must have the power to liberate Taiwan, and the traitorous clique must be completely eliminated. This is the hope and belief of our overseas Chinese."

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 3rd: The New York "Daily Worker" published an editorial on August 30th stating that Washington's "defense" of Taiwan deception is becoming more and more blatant - and more and more dangerous to world peace. Yesterday, Dulles added the islands off the coast of China, in addition to the island of Taiwan, as places where American boys might fight and die, for the purpose of preventing China from acquiring its own territory 6,000 miles from San Francisco.

The editorial said: Anyone who looks at the location of Taiwan can see that the pretext of a painstakingly crafted "moral basis of the free world" completely collapses. Imagine if a country sent its navy across the ocean, occupied Long Island, and declared it part of its line of defense, what would we (the United States) do.

The editorial said: Americans who once asked the question "Who wants to die for Quemoy and Matsu?" and saved their children as a result, had better start saying in equally loud tones: "Who wants to die for Chiang Kai-shek?"

    印度尼西亚华侨报纸“新报”发表社论
    拥护祖国决心完成解放台湾的光荣任务
    纽约“工人日报”谴责美国当局阻挠我解放台湾
    【新华社四日讯】雅加达消息：印度尼西亚华侨报纸“新报”八月二十七日以“从华侨看解放台湾”为题发表社论，拥护中华人民共和国各民主党派各人民团体为解放台湾联合宣言。社论说：“中国人民正面对一个光荣的历史任务，就是解放台湾。”社论列举了印度尼西亚华侨亲身经历的蒋介石卖国集团迫害华侨的事实。社论指出：蒋匪帮几年来对华侨进行欺骗宣传，榨取华侨财产，引诱华侨青年做炮灰，并派遣特务分子在东南亚各地迫害爱国华侨。所以，解放台湾是一千二百万华侨的共同要求。社论说：我们亲身体验到，不消灭台湾卖国集团，许多华侨就要继续受到欺骗和榨取；不消灭台湾卖国集团，华侨社会就不得安宁，华侨就要继续受到他们的迫害。“中国人民一定有力量解放台湾，卖国集团一定被彻底消灭，这是我们华侨的希望和信念。”
    【新华社柏林三日电】纽约“工人日报”八月三十日发表社论说：华盛顿的“保卫”台湾的骗局越来越露骨——而且对于世界和平越来越危险了。昨天杜勒斯在台湾本岛以外又加上了中国沿海的岛屿，作为美国男儿可能打仗送命的地方，而送命的目的却是阻止中国取得离旧金山有六千英里远的它自己的领土。
    社论说：任何人看一下台湾的位置，苦心制造的“自由世界道义根据”的借口就全部垮台了。可以设想一下，如果有某一个国家派遣海军横渡远洋而来，霸占长岛，并宣布这是它的防线的一部分，我们（美国）将怎样。
    社论说：曾经提出“谁愿意为保大送命？”的质问因而拯救了自己的孩子的美国人，最好开始以同样响亮的声调说：“谁愿意替蒋介石送命？”
