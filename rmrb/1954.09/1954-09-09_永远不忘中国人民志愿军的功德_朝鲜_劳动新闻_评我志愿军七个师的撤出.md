Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 8th. The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial on the 7th regarding the withdrawal of seven divisions from Korea by the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers, entitled "Never Forget the Merits of the Chinese People's Volunteers," expressing gratitude to the Chinese People's Volunteers who are about to return home.

The editorial said: Holding high the banner of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, the Chinese People's Volunteers fought alongside the Korean People's Army, dealt a heavy blow to the American aggressors, and achieved a historic victory. After the armistice, the Chinese People's Volunteers, with high vigilance, have been safeguarding the victorious achievements of the Korean armistice, and at the same time helping us to carry out post-war reconstruction work. The merits of the Chinese People's Volunteers are higher than Mount Tai and deeper than the sea; they have forged a deep friendship with our people, closer than that of real brothers.

The editorial said: As Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Malenkov, pointed out, the immortal achievements of the Chinese People's Volunteers prove that the unity between the people of Asian countries is unbreakable. This is a sign that a new era has begun in the East, a sign of the determination of the Asian people to strive for and safeguard national freedom and independence, and not to allow Asia to become a breeding ground for a new world war.

The editorial emphasized: Today, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, together, with high vigilance, are watching the conspiracies of the U.S. imperialism and the Lee Seung-man clique to plan a new war, and are firmly defending the line of peace. As the experience of the past three years of war has shown, any conspiracy of the enemies of peace will be completely crushed.

The editorial concluded: As seven divisions of the Chinese People's Volunteers are about to withdraw from Korea, the entire Korean people, regarding the great achievements established by the Chinese People's Volunteers, extend warm gratitude and honor to all the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers, the great Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong. At the same time, the entire Korean people are firmly determined to further strengthen the friendship and unity between the two countries, heighten vigilance, and smash the enemy's conspiracy to launch a new war, so as to realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

Glory to the heroic officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers!

    永远不忘中国人民志愿军的功德
    ——朝鲜“劳动新闻”评我志愿军七个师的撤出
    【新华社平壤八日电】朝鲜“劳动新闻”七日就中国人民志愿军总部将从朝鲜撤出七个师一事发表题为“永远不忘中国人民志愿军的功德”的社论，对将要回国的中国人民志愿军将士们表示感谢。
    社论说：中国人民志愿军高举抗美援朝保家卫国的旗帜，和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，给予美国侵略者以沉重的打击，取得了历史性的胜利。停战后，中国人民志愿军又以高度的警惕，保卫着朝鲜停战的胜利果实，同时帮助我们进行战后恢复建设工作。中国人民志愿军的功德比泰山还高，比大海还深；他们和我们人民结下了深深的友情，比亲兄弟还亲。
    社论说：如同苏联部长会议主席马林科夫指出过的一样，中国人民志愿军的不朽的功绩证明亚洲各国人民之间的团结是牢不可破的。这是在东方开始了新纪元的标志，这是亚洲人民争取并维护民族自由和独立、不让亚洲成为新世界大战的温床的决心的标志。
    社论强调指出：今天，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军一起，以高度的警惕注视着美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮策划新战争的阴谋，坚强地保卫着和平防线。如过去三年战争的经验所表示的一样，和平敌人的任何阴谋诡计，都会被彻底粉碎的。
    社论最后说：在中国人民志愿军七个师就要撤出朝鲜的时候，全体朝鲜人民就中国人民志愿军将士们所建立的伟大功勋，向全体中国人民志愿军将士、伟大的中国人民、中国共产党和中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席，致以热烈的感谢和荣誉。全体朝鲜人民同时坚定决心：将进一步加强两国之间的友谊团结，提高警惕，粉碎敌人重新发动战争的阴谋，以实现祖国的和平统一。
    光荣归于英雄的中国人民志愿军将士们！
