People across the country celebrate the promulgation of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China

[This newspaper dispatch] Workers and peasants across the country warmly support the promulgation of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, and have expressed that they will resolutely support and abide by the Constitution, and will use practical actions to implement the tasks stipulated in the Constitution.

The broad masses of workers in Anshan, the steel capital, have stated that they will resolutely fulfill the sacred obligation to abide by the Constitution. All the workers of the tool workshop of Anshan Iron and Steel Works Machinery General Factory, where National People's Congress representative Wang Chonglun is located, unanimously proposed to resolutely implement the Constitution, continue to carry out labor competitions, ensure safe production, and complete the national production plan ahead of schedule. At the construction site of the third automated blast furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel, which is about to be completed, the pipe fitters proposed that the water test of the blast furnace water pipes must be completed on the 21st, to create conditions for the blast furnace to be baked ahead of schedule.

Inspired by the good news of the promulgation of the Constitution, many employees of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant created new records for shift production on the night of the promulgation. All major production workshops of the plant, such as open-hearth steelmaking, steel rolling, electric furnace steelmaking, ironmaking, and coking, overfulfilled the daily production plan on the 20th, producing hundreds of tons more of pig iron, steel, and various steel products for the country. The boiler repair team of Taiyuan No. 2 Power Plant, where National People's Congress representative Wang Kaishan is located, guarantees to complete all boiler repairs before National Day and ensure the safe power supply to various factories and mines in Taiyuan City in the fourth quarter.

Liu Huaqing, a worker at the Jiang’an Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory in Wuhan who participated in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, said excitedly after reading the Constitution: "The Constitution stipulates that we must defend national sovereignty, territorial integrity, and security. I respond to the call of the motherland to support the liberation of Taiwan." Fang Jie’an, an old worker at the No. 5 Power Plant of the Wuhan Metallurgical and Electrical Industry Bureau, also stated that he would implement the provisions of the Constitution into action and ensure that labor discipline is well observed in production.

When the good news of the promulgation of the Constitution reached the Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Xigou Township, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, the members immediately held a forum and unanimously guaranteed to cut 800,000 catties of artemisia before the autumn harvest to make fertilizer for increased production next year. At the forum held by the members of the Changzhi Sino-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm after listening to the Constitution broadcast, they unanimously stated that they would harvest carefully and strive to increase grain production by another five catties per mu during the autumn harvest, with a total increase of 70,000 catties for the entire farm, to ensure that 1.25 million catties of surplus grain will be sold to the state this year.

Sichuan farmers warmly welcome National Day and celebrate the promulgation of the Constitution. In the villages of bumper harvest, people delivering and selling grain to the state can be seen everywhere. Farmers in the third district of Bishan County have been continuously transporting grain to the Laifengyi warehouse day and night. The three warehouses have purchased 960,000 catties of dry grain in nine days.

After the good news of the birth of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China reached Urumqi City, Xinjiang Province, people of all ethnic groups in the city unanimously cheered the birth of the Constitution in different languages. On the evening of the 21st, twenty-two Han and Uyghur model workers and meritorious workers from various workshops of the October Automobile Repair Plant held a forum. Li Mingquan, the leader of the carriage group in the car body workshop, said: In order to welcome the convening of the National People's Congress, the group has completed the original plan for one month in twenty days. In the future, we must work harder and abide by and implement the provisions of the Constitution in an exemplary manner.

When the people of all ethnic groups on the Yunnan border heard the good news, they couldn’t help but cheer and applaud. In Jinghong, the capital of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, more than 1,200 people listened to the broadcast, and that night they also held a celebration meeting and sang the Aini ethnic group's "Harvest Song" and "Ode to Chairman Mao" and other songs. In Mangshi, the capital of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, more than 800 people listened to the broadcast of the adoption of the Constitution and held a discussion meeting.

After hearing the good news of the birth of the Constitution, people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Hohhot City were overjoyed. Factories and school areas were filled with gongs and drums, and a scene of jubilation. In order to celebrate and call on the people of all ethnic groups, including Hui and Han, in the region to conscientiously abide by and implement the Constitution, the Hui Autonomous Region convened a people's representative conference of all ethnic groups and all circles and a conference of grassroots cadres. The labor competition launched by all the workers of the Hui People’s Production and Supply Cooperative Oil Press to welcome the National People’s Congress has achieved results, and the oil yield has increased by 2%.

Employees of various factories and mines in Xikang Province celebrated the convening of the National People's Congress and the birth of the Constitution with new production achievements. During the conference, the employees of the Ya’an Automobile Repair Factory of the State-owned Xikang Province Transportation Company shortened the time required to overhaul a vehicle from 24 days to 13 days, breaking the highest record for vehicle repairs in previous years.

People of all ethnic groups in Xining City, Qinghai Province, have expressed that they will take practical actions to ensure the implementation of the Constitution. Han Sigong, the leader of the pot casting group in the foundry workshop of the Xining Machinery Repair Factory, said excitedly: "Every article of our Constitution is in line with the interests of the working class and the people of the whole country. Our workers must implement the Constitution in an exemplary manner. I want to lead all comrades in the group to avoid wasting materials, take care of machines, abide by labor discipline, and strive to overfulfill the production plan by 10% from now until November."

Returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese in Guangzhou celebrated the promulgation of the Constitution. Pan Fatao, a returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia who had just returned to Guangzhou on September 13, said: "I just returned to the motherland and encountered the great joy of the birth of the Constitution, which is really exciting. The promulgation of this Constitution will further unite millions of overseas Chinese around the motherland." Wang Jianchu, a returned overseas Chinese and vice chairman of the Overseas Chinese Industrial Construction Co., Ltd., said: "The birth of the Constitution is a major event for the people of the whole country and overseas Chinese to celebrate together; I will resolutely abide by and support this people's Constitution."
