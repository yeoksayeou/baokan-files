    Communiqué of the State Statistical Bureau of the Central People's Government on the Results of National Economic Development and Implementation of the National Plan for 1953
    September 12, 1954

    1953 was the first year of China's implementation of the first five-year plan for national economic construction. The beginning of the country's planned economic construction, the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao on the general task of our country during the transition period, the nationwide campaign to increase production and practice economy that began in September, and the policy of planned purchase and supply of grain implemented in November, greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the national laboring people for economic construction and ensured the overfulfillment of the national plan for 1953. This has enabled our country to take a step forward in socialist industrialization and in the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. The development of industrial and agricultural production, the completion of capital construction, the expansion of transportation and trade, the development of cultural, educational, and health undertakings, and the improvement of the lives of workers and staff in the past year are reported as follows:

    (1) Completion of Industrial Production Plan

    In 1953, the total industrial output value of state-owned, cooperative-operated, and joint state-private industrial enterprises nationwide completed 107% of the national annual plan target. State-owned industries completed 107% of the plan; cooperative-operated industries completed 103% of the plan; and joint state-private industries completed 109% of the plan.

    In 1953, the percentages of the annual total industrial output value plan completed by the various central ministries were as follows: Ministry of Fuel Industry 108%, of which General Administration of Electric Power Industry 105%, General Administration of Coal Mining 110%, General Administration of Petroleum Industry 109%; Ministry of Heavy Industry 109%, of which Anshan Iron and Steel Company 110%, Iron and Steel Industry Administration 107%, Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration 111%, Chemical Industry Administration 114%, Building Materials Industry Administration 106%; First Ministry of Machine Building 119%; Ministry of Textile Industry 104%; Ministry of Light Industry 112%; industrial enterprises under the Ministry of Forestry 132%; industrial enterprises under the Ministry of Railways 107%; industrial enterprises under the Ministry of Food 103%.

    (5) Agricultural Production and Technological Improvements

    In 1953, many areas suffered from spring drought and autumn floods, and various natural disasters were quite serious. However, due to the active leadership of the Party and government at all levels in guiding farmers to fight against natural disasters, and on the basis of the further development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the promotion of agricultural technology was strengthened. Therefore, the total grain output in 1953 increased slightly compared with 1952.

    In 1953, the planting area of grain crops was over 126 million hectares, and the planting area of cash crops was over 11 million hectares.

    In 1953, 11 machine tractor stations were established on a pilot basis, 30 tractor work teams were established in agricultural technology promotion stations, and 9 tractor tilling teams were attached to state-owned mechanized farms.

    In 1953, the state issued a total of 12 trillion yuan in agricultural loans (excluding state-owned agricultural and water conservancy loans and local agricultural loans), an increase of 40% compared with 1952.

    In 1953, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in agricultural production continued to develop. Approximately 43% of the total number of farm households in the country participated in agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation organizations. In 1953, the number of agricultural production cooperatives had grown to more than 14,900, with a total of more than 275,000 participating households; the number of cooperatives increased by approximately three times compared with 1952, and the number of households increased by approximately 3.7 times compared with 1952. Farm households participating in year-round mutual aid teams accounted for approximately 28% of the number of farm households participating in mutual aid and cooperation organizations.

    In 1953, in terms of farmland water conservancy work, the total irrigated area was expanded by approximately 660,000 hectares due to the construction and renovation of many ponds, dams, culverts, ditches, and other projects, and the lending of 160,000 waterwheels.

    Animal husbandry also developed in 1953. The total number of large and small livestock in the country increased compared with 1952, of which cattle increased by approximately 9%, horses increased by approximately 7%, sheep increased by approximately 12%, and pigs increased by approximately 6%.

    There are already 83 state-owned pastures and breeding farms led by provinces (cities) nationwide, with more than 100,000 head of breeding livestock of better breeds.

    The total output of aquatic products in 1953 reached approximately 1.89 million tons, an increase of 9% compared with 1952. Among them, the fishing production of state-owned enterprises was more than 113,000 tons, an increase of 30% compared with 1952.

    In 1953, the area of afforestation nationwide continued to expand, and mass mutual aid and cooperation in afforestation also developed. Larger areas of shelterbelts continued to be built in Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, Northwest China, and other places, expanding the area of shelterbelts by more than 400,000 hectares (including water source forests); the shelterbelt zones in eastern Henan and western Hebei have begun to show protective effects.

    (6) Development of Transportation and Postal and Telecommunications Services

    In 1953, the percentages of completion of the planned freight volume of state-owned transportation were: railway 113, coastal 111, Yangtze River and Songhua River 109, automobile 86, civil aviation 140; the percentages of completion of the planned freight turnover were: railway 122, coastal 113, Yangtze River and Songhua River 115, automobile 108, civil aviation 139.

Most of the private transportation industries in various regions have accepted the unified dispatch and cargo distribution of the local state-owned transportation industries and followed the unified freight rates stipulated by the local authorities.

    In 1953, due to the development of the national economy, the continuous promotion of advanced Soviet experience in various transportation departments, and the campaign to increase production and practice economy launched in the third quarter, the national transportation plan was overfulfilled. However, the efficiency of the use of transportation tools mostly did not complete the plan, certain sections of the main trunk lines showed insufficient transportation capacity, and the growth rate of transportation capacity could not fully meet the needs of the rapid development of the national economy.

    In 1953, the number of postal and telecommunications bureaus and offices increased by 5% compared with 1952, and postal and telecommunications business income completed 112% of the plan; the volume of business increased by 25% compared with 1952.
