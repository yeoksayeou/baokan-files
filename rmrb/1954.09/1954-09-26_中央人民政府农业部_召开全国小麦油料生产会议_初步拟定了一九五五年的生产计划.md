Xinhua News Agency report: The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government convened a national wheat and oilseed production meeting from August 12th to 25th. The meeting primarily formulated a preliminary production plan for wheat and oilseed for 1955 based on the needs of national socialist industrialization and the people's livelihood. The meeting also summarized and studied effective measures to increase production of wheat and vegetable oil in various regions, as well as how to further leverage the role of state-owned farms and agricultural scientific research institutions in increasing wheat and vegetable oil production.

The meeting pointed out that this year, all regions have made great efforts in oilseed production. According to preliminary estimates, the planting area of peanuts, rapeseed, sesame, flax, and soybeans nationwide has expanded by approximately 3% compared to last year. Although some production areas have suffered severe natural disasters, the total output is still expected to increase by 8.7% compared to last year. Other oil crops such as sunflowers, castor beans, and hemp have also seen significant increases in planting due to vigorous promotion. However, the increase in oilseed production in recent years has not kept pace with the growing demand for edible oil, and the supply of edible oil is still felt to be insufficient. This problem must be gradually and effectively resolved. The meeting believes that expanding the planting area of oil crops according to local conditions, striving to improve cultivation techniques, and increasing the yield per unit area of oil crops are the fundamental solutions to the edible oil problem. In 1955 and 1956, it is required to expand the rapeseed planting area by 19.49 million mu, the peanut planting area by 7.07 million mu, the sesame planting area by 1.7 million mu, and the flax planting area by 2.02 million mu, for a total expansion of 30.28 million mu, compared to 1954. From the perspective of long-term oilseed production increase, it is also required to develop perennial woody oilseed crops in mountainous areas starting in 1955, and to plant walnuts, oil tea, and Chinese prickly ash in large quantities, and to develop oil palm and coconut in tropical and subtropical areas. While extensively mobilizing farmers to plant oil crops, all regions must prevent blind expansion and excessive squeezing of grain field areas. In the south, emphasis should be placed on fully utilizing winter fallow fields to plant more rapeseed. In the north, emphasis should be placed on using sandy or barren land to plant peanuts, and intercropping or strip-cropping oil crops in between large autumn crops. All regions should also universally call on farmers to make full use of gaps in fields, field ridges, roadsides, ditch edges, and residential gardens to plant more sunflowers, castor beans, sesame, soybeans, and other crops. The meeting studied measures to increase the production of various oil crops: for peanuts, it is necessary to do a good job in deep plowing, early plowing, meticulous land preparation, implement seed selection, sun drying of seeds, and appropriate dense planting, adopt concentrated fertilization methods such as ditch application and hole application, and require key production areas to reach 30% to 40% inoculation of peanut rhizobia next year, and all regions should cultivate soil and earth up the plants in a timely manner, and also pay attention to drainage in rainy and low-lying areas. For rapeseed, it is necessary to strengthen seed selection, sow seeds in a timely manner according to local climatic conditions, implement appropriate dense planting in general areas, actively promote thinning in areas with excessively dense broadcasting, promote phased fertilization, especially focusing on fertilization during the flowering period, cultivate soil and earth up the plants in a timely manner, and pay attention to drainage. For soybeans, it is necessary to select improved varieties, implement appropriate dense planting or thinning according to local conditions, increase the application of fertilizers with higher phosphorus and potassium content, and require key production areas to reach 60% to 70% inoculation of soybean rhizobia next year, and all regions should weed in a timely manner and pay attention to pest control. For sesame, it is necessary to improve sowing techniques, increase the application of manure, strengthen field management, pay attention to drainage and pest control. For flax, it is necessary to do a good job in autumn plowing, deep plowing, implement appropriate dense planting, advance the sowing period, and increase the application of fertilizer. In addition, it is necessary to further strengthen the production of woody oil plants, not only from a long-term perspective but also accelerate planting to obtain benefits as soon as possible. The meeting believes that the task of increasing oilseed production is arduous. All provinces must convene special meetings to earnestly study their provincial oilseed production and supply plans, formulate measures to increase production, and strengthen political and economic work in rural areas, relying on mutual aid and cooperative organizations to drive the vast number of farmers to ensure the completion of the oil crop planting tasks. Currently, rapeseed production areas in the south must quickly implement the sowing tasks and do a good job in all preparations before sowing. All regions should also make early arrangements for oilseeds to be sown next spring.

The meeting pointed out that this year, most of the wheat in the country has had a bumper harvest. According to preliminary calculations, the planting area reached 408.46 million mu, an increase of 6.5% compared to last year, exceeding this year's plan by 2.4%; the total output increased by more than 20% compared to last year, exceeding this year's plan by more than 3%; the yield per unit area increased by 13.3% compared to last year, exceeding this year's plan by 1.5%. Although wheat production has been continuously improving in recent years, the rate of increase has been relatively slow; the demand for wheat from the state and the people is growing rapidly. Therefore, striving to increase wheat production and improve its commodity rate is a long-term and serious task on the agricultural production front in the future. The meeting analyzed the current wheat production situation: in the winter wheat production areas in the north, except for cotton-growing areas that need to appropriately reduce wheat fields in accordance with the state's plan to expand cotton fields, the wheat field area in grain-producing areas should be stabilized at this year's level, but with the development of water conservancy construction, the multiple cropping area may still increase. In the winter wheat production areas in the south, the wheat commodity rate is higher, and the yield per unit area is not lower than that of the main wheat-producing areas in the north, but most of the wheat fields are currently cultivated and managed extensively, with great potential for increasing production, and there are a large number of winter fallow fields that can be rationally utilized. In the spring wheat production areas with wider land and less labor, because wheat cultivation and management are relatively labor-saving, expanding wheat planting can save labor, plant miscellaneous grain crops well, eliminate wasteland reclamation, and increase the total grain output. Based on these situations, the national wheat planting area next year can basically remain stable at this year's level, but appropriate adjustments need to be made in the regions, that is, the winter wheat production areas in the north will reduce a part of the wheat fields, and the winter wheat production areas in the south and the spring wheat production areas will expand a part of the wheat fields; the yield per unit area is required to increase by an average of 3% to 4% compared to this year. All regions must strengthen specific leadership over wheat production and do a good job in a series of ideological, organizational, and technical preparations before wheat planting; they must take mutual aid and cooperative organizations as the center, vigorously implement various proven yield-increasing measures: propagate and promote existing improved varieties, expand the promotion of narrow-row uniform sowing and dense planting, do a good job in deep plowing and moisture conservation, open up fertilizer sources and increase fertilizer application, expand irrigation or pay attention to drainage, strengthen field management, and prevent natural disasters; the flood-stricken areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River must also step up drainage, prepare wheat seeds as early as possible, and plant as much wheat and other winter crops as possible in order to strive to complete the task of increasing wheat production next year.

The meeting summarized the wheat production situation and experience of eight state-owned mechanized farms, including Lutai, Shuangqiao, Wulidian, Qinghe, Baoding, Jiheng, Jinyuan, and Gaocun, whose representatives attended the meeting. The meeting pointed out that this year, these eight farms actively improved cultivation techniques, strengthened business management, and the yield per unit area of winter wheat generally increased by 20% to 30% compared to last year, exceeding that of local farmers by one time; the production cost decreased by 10% to 20% compared to last year; and they propagated more than 1.8 million jin of improved winter wheat varieties, which, in addition to their own retention, can supply about 1.2 million jin to other farms and farmers. The meeting also put forward improvement opinions on some of the problems existing in the large-scale mechanized production of these eight farms. The meeting required all farms: first, through the research and discussion of all employees, to formulate technical measure plans that meet the actual situation; second, to strengthen business management, implement quota management and responsibility systems, promote rationalization proposals, launch labor competitions, and establish a recording system for crop growth and field observation; third, to carry out mass business learning in a planned and organized manner, earnestly study the advanced experience and science and technology of the Soviet Union, and humbly absorb the inherent good experience of the farmers, so that theory is combined with practice and the production level of the farms is continuously improved.

    中央人民政府农业部
    召开全国小麦油料生产会议
    初步拟定了一九五五年的生产计划
    【新华社讯】中央人民政府农业部在八月十二日到二十五日召开了全国小麦油料生产会议。会议主要根据国家社会主义工业化和人民生活的需要，初步拟定了一九五五年小麦和油料的生产计划。会议还总结和研究了各个不同地区小麦和植物油料的有效增产措施，以及如何进一步发挥国营农场和农业科学研究机关在小麦和植物油料增产上的作用问题。
    会议指出：今年各地在油料生产上作了很大努力，据初步估计，全国花生、油菜、芝麻、胡麻、大豆的种植面积约比去年扩大百分之三，虽然若干产地遭受了严重的自然灾害，总产量仍可比去年增加百分之八点七。其他如向日葵、蓖麻、大麻等，经过大力提倡，也增种不少。但是，几年来油料产量的增加赶不上人民对食油的需要的增长，目前食油仍感供不应求。这一问题必须逐步地切实地予以解决。会议认为：因地制宜扩大油料作物的种植面积，努力改进栽培技术，提高油料的单位面积产量，是解决食油问题的根本出路。在一九五五年和一九五六年两年内，要求比一九五四年扩大油菜种植面积一千九百四十九万亩，扩大花生种植面积七百零七万亩，扩大芝麻种植面积一百七十万亩，扩大胡麻种植面积二百零二万亩，共计扩大三千零二十八万亩。从长期增产油料着眼，还要求一九五五年起在山区发展多年生木本油料，大量种植核桃、油茶、花椒，在热带、亚热带发展油棕、椰子等。各地在广泛动员农民种植油料作物时，要防止盲目扩大和过分挤缩粮田面积。在南方着重提倡充分利用冬闲田多种油菜。在北方着重利用沙荒或瘠薄地种花生，并在大秋作物中间种或带种油料作物。各地并要普遍号召农民利用田边、地埂、路旁、沟沿、宅园等隙地，尽力多种向日葵、蓖麻、芝麻、大豆等。会议研究各种油料作物的增产措施是：花生要做好深耕、早耕，精细整地，实行选种、晒种和适当密植，采用沟施、穴施等集中施肥的方法，并要求重点产区明年花生根瘤菌拌种面积达到百分之三十到四十，各地都要适时中耕培土，多雨和低洼地区还要注意排水。油菜要加强选种，根据当地气候条件适时播种，一般地区实行适当密植，撒播过密地区要积极提倡疏苗，推广分期施肥，特别着重花期施肥，适时中耕培土和注意排水。大豆要选用良种，根据当地情况实行适当密植或疏苗，增施含磷、钾较多的肥料，并要求重点产区明年大豆根瘤菌拌种面积达到百分之六十到七十，各地都要及时中耕除草，注意防治虫害。芝麻要改进播种技术，增施粪肥，加强田间管理，注意排水和防治虫害。胡麻要做好秋耕、深耕，实行适当密植，提早播种期，增施肥料。此外，必须进一步加强木本油料植物的生产，既要从长期着眼，又要加速种植，以尽早获得收益。会议认为增产油料的任务是艰巨的。各省必须召开专门会议，认真研究本省油料生产供应计划，制定增产措施，并须加强农村中的政治工作和一系列的经济工作，依靠互助合作组织带动广大农民，来保证完成油料作物的播种任务。目前南方油菜产区要迅速把播种任务贯彻下去，做好播种前的一切准备工作。对明年春季播种的油料，各地也应早作安排。
    会议指出：今年全国小麦大部丰收，据初步计算，播种面积达四亿零八百四十六万多亩，比去年增加百分之六点五，超过今年计划百分之二点四；总产量比去年增加百分之二十以上，超过今年计划百分之三以上；单位面积产量比去年增加百分之十三点三，超过今年计划百分之一点五。几年来小麦产量虽然不断提高，但是增产的速度较为缓慢；国家和人民对小麦的需要量，却增长很快。因此，努力增产小麦并提高其商品额，是今后农业生产战线上一项长期的严重的任务。会议分析了当前小麦生产情况：北方冬小麦产区除宜棉地区需要按照国家扩大棉田的计划适当缩小麦田外，产粮地区的麦田面积应稳定于今年水平，但随着水利建设的发展，复种面积仍有可能增加。南方冬小麦产区小麦商品率较高，单位面积产量并不低于北方主要产麦区，而目前大部麦田耕作管理粗放，增产潜力很大，且有大量冬季休闲田可以合理利用。在土地较广劳力较少的春小麦产区，由于小麦栽培管理比较省工，扩大种麦可以节省劳力，种好杂粮作物，消除撩荒现象，增加粮食总产量。根据这些情况，明年全国小麦种植面积基本上仍可稳定于今年水平，但需要在地区上作适当的调整，即北方冬小麦产区缩减一部分麦田，南方冬小麦产区和春小麦产区都扩大一部分麦田；单位面积产量要求平均比今年提高百分之三到四。各地必须加强对小麦生产的具体领导，作好种麦前思想上、组织上、技术上一系列的准备工作；必须以互助合作组织为中心，大力贯彻各项已经肯定的增产措施：繁殖和推广现有优良品种，扩大推广窄行匀播密植，作好深耕保墒，开辟肥料来源和增施肥料，扩大灌溉或注意排水，加强田间管理，防御自然灾害等；长江中下游水灾区还必须加紧排水，及早准备好麦种，尽量多种小麦等冬季作物，以争取完成明年小麦增产的任务。
    会议就有代表到会的芦台、双桥、五里店、清河、保定、冀衡、晋源、高村等八个国营机械农场，总结了它们今年小麦生产的情况和经验。会议指出：今年这八个农场由于积极改进栽培技术，加强经营管理，冬小麦单位面积产量一般比去年提高百分之二十到三十，超过当地农民一倍；生产成本比去年降低百分之十到二十；并繁殖冬小麦良种一百八十多万斤，除自己留用外，能供给其他农场和农民约一百二十多万斤。会议并针对这八个农场在大面积机械化生产中存在的一些问题，提出了改进的意见。会议要求各农场：首先，经过全体职工的研究和讨论，制定切合实际情况的技术措施计划，其次，加强经营管理，贯彻定额管理和责任制度，推行合理化建议，展开劳动竞赛，并建立作物生育和田间观察的记载制度；第三，有领导有计划地开展群众性的业务学习，认真学习苏联的先进经验和科学技术，并虚心地吸取农民中固有的好经验，使理论结合实践，不断提高农场的生产水平。
