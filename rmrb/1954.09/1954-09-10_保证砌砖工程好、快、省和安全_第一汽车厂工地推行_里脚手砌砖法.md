Guarantee Good, Fast, Economical, and Safe Bricklaying
First Automobile Factory Construction Site Promotes the "Inside Scaffold Bricklaying Method"

The First Automobile Factory construction site is promoting an advanced experience called the "Inside Scaffold Bricklaying Method." This is a technological innovation in bricklaying engineering that not only saves a significant amount of timber and ensures project quality, but also plays a significant role in safe production and accelerating project progress.

Scaffolding is a temporary structure in building construction. It consists of those high and large wooden frames tied together for laying bricks. Traditionally, housing construction in our country has involved building scaffolding on the outside of walls, from the ground up before any bricklaying, requiring a lot of timber and scaffolding workers. This type of scaffolding is generally only 1.2 meters wide, serving as a workspace for bricklayers, a platform for stacking bricklaying materials, and a main route for transporting materials up and down. Because it is erected on the outside of the wall, it is called "external scaffolding" in engineering. The inside scaffold bricklaying method now being promoted is one of the important creations of Soviet construction workers. It places the scaffolding inside the wall. Construction begins with bricklaying, and when the wall reaches 1.2 meters high, the first step of scaffolding is erected; when it reaches 2.4 meters high, the second step of scaffolding is erected. When the bricklaying of the first floor is completed, the scaffolding can be immediately moved to the second floor, thus saving a large amount of timber and scaffolding workers.

In the past, the bricklaying work at the First Automobile Factory construction site also followed the traditional method of using external scaffolding. Later, under the advocacy and assistance of Soviet expert Comrade Ribak, the use of inside scaffolding was piloted starting in March of this year. However, the first difficulty encountered at the time was ideological resistance from the actual operators. They said that from ancient times to the present, they had always stood outside the wall to lay bricks, and now it was impossible to work standing inside the wall. To dispel this ideological concern, the construction site selected two model bricklaying teams working in the auxiliary workshop for a month of training and learning. Only then did the experiment begin. During the experiment, another difficulty was encountered: how to point the joints. In the past, standing on the external scaffolding, the wall was laid first, and then high-grade mortar was used to point the joints. Now, standing inside the wall, it was necessary to lower the head from top to bottom to point the joints, which became a problem. Especially when the wall was more than one meter high, pointing the joints became even more difficult. At this time, Soviet expert Comrade Ribak conducted research. He suggested pointing the joints while laying the bricks, and using the original mortar, that is, the mortar squeezed out during bricklaying, instead of high-grade mortar. In this way, high-grade mortar was saved, and the pointed joints were beautiful and uniform. During this period, difficulties were also encountered in solving the problem of decorative plastering of walls, especially the decorative plastering on the eaves. Later, a partial scaffold protruding from the window was used to solve it.

After solving these ideological concerns and specific difficulties in construction, the inside scaffold bricklaying method was successfully tested. Over the past five months, it has gradually been promoted from the auxiliary workshop to the entire construction site. Up to now, inside scaffolding has been adopted in all rooms where the inside scaffold bricklaying method can be used. Facts have proved that inside scaffolding has many advantages. The most prominent is saving. It saves timber, all scaffolding workers, and high-grade mortar. And the more multi-story buildings there are, the greater the amount saved. According to current test results, the cost of inside scaffolding is 80 percent less than the cost of external scaffolding. The second is safety. Because the inside scaffolding is built indoors and is only 2.4 meters high, and the site is relatively spacious, this changes the situation of high-altitude operations and eliminates the risk of falls. At the same time, it also facilitates the activities of bricklayers and the transportation of bricklaying materials, which is very beneficial for accelerating the progress of the project. Finally, it creates conditions for mechanized construction.

The promotion of the inside scaffold bricklaying method at the First Automobile Factory construction site proves that before promoting this advanced working method, it is necessary to have mechanical lifting and transportation equipment to solve the problem of vertical transportation of brick, mortar, and prefabricated components. Without this, there is no condition for implementing the inside scaffold bricklaying method. Secondly, the inside scaffold bricklaying method is suitable for multi-story buildings, but not for single-story factory buildings above four meters. Even in multi-story buildings, the foundation must be leveled and compacted when doing the bottom layer and interior walls. For building multi-story buildings, the floor slabs must be laid first. It is impossible to succeed without paying attention to these conditions.

    保证砌砖工程好、快、省和安全
    第一汽车厂工地推行“里脚手砌砖法”
    第一汽车厂工地，推行了一种叫做“里脚手砌砖法”的先进经验。这是砌墙工程上的技术革新，它不但节省了大量木材，保证了工程质量，而且对于安全生产与加快工程进度起了很大作用。
    脚手（或称脚手架）是房屋建筑工程中的临时构造。就是为了砌墙累砖而捆成的那些又高又大的木架子。我国的房屋建筑工程，从来都是把脚手架搭在墙壁的外面，并且是在砌墙之前，从底搭到顶，需要很多木材和架子工。这种脚手架，一般只有一点二公尺宽，是砌墙工人的活动场所，堆置砌砖材料的站台，又是材料上下输送的要道。因为它搭在墙壁的外面，工程学上叫做“外脚手”。现在所推行的里脚手砌砖法，是苏联建筑工作者的重要创造之一。它把脚手架搭在墙壁的里面，工程一开始就砌砖，等砌到一点二公尺高时，搭第一步脚手架；砌到二点四公尺高时，再搭第二步脚手架就够了。而且当第一层楼的砌墙工程做完时，就可以随即把脚手架搬到二层楼，因此节省大量木板和架子工。
    第一汽车厂工地的砌墙工程，以前也是按着以往习惯，用外脚手方法工作的。后经苏联专家里巴克同志的倡导和帮助，在今年三月开始试用里脚手。但当时碰到的第一个困难，就是实际操作者的思想抵抗。他们说，从古到今都是站在墙外面砌砖，现在站在墙里面没法干活。为了解除这种思想顾虑，工地挑选了在辅助工场工作的两个模范瓦工组，做了为时一月的训练、学习。以后才开始试验。在试验当中，又碰到如何勾缝的困难。因为从前站在外脚手架上，砌好了墙以后，再另用高标号灰浆勾缝。现在站在墙壁里面，要由上而下地低下头来勾缝，这就成了问题。特别是当墙壁砌到一公尺以上的时候，勾缝就更为困难。这时，苏联专家里巴克同志做了研究。他建议随砌墙随勾缝。同时建议不用高标号灰浆，就用原灰浆，即砌砖时挤出来的灰浆勾缝。这样一来，既节省了高标号灰浆，勾出来的缝又美观一致。在这期间，还碰到墙壁花式粉刷，特别是房檐上的花式粉刷没法解决的困难。后来用从窗口挑出来的局部架子解决了。
    在解决了这些思想顾虑和施工中的具体困难以后，里脚手砌砖法试验成功了。五个月来，它已经由辅助工场逐步推广到全工地。到现在，凡是能用里脚手砌砖法的房间，都采用了里脚手架。事实证明，里脚手架有许多好处。其中最突出的是节省。它节省木材，节省全部架子工，节省高标号灰浆。而且越是多层的楼房建筑，节省的数量就越大。就现在试验结果来看，里脚手的费用，要比外脚手的费用少百分之八十。其次是安全。因为里脚手架搭在室内，只有二点四公尺高，场面也比较宽阔，这就改变了那种高空作业的局面，没有摔伤的危险。同时，也便利了砌砖工人的活动和砌砖材料的输送，对加快工程速度极有好处。最后是给机械化施工创造了条件。
    第一汽车厂工地推广里脚手砌砖法中证明：在推广这种先进工作法之前，首先要有机械起重的运输设备，以解决砖灰材料和预制构件的垂直运输问题。没有这点，就没有实行里脚手砌砖法的条件。其次，里脚手砌砖法适用于多层的楼房建筑，不适用于四公尺以上的单层的厂房建筑。就是在多层的楼房建筑上，做底层和室内墙壁时，要先把地基填平，夯实。砌多层楼房，又要先铺好楼板。不注意这些条件就不可能成功。
