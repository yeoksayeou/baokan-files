Xinhua News Agency, September 4th—Under U.S. support, West Germany is accelerating its rearmament.

According to the German News Agency, the French "International Forum" recently revealed the secrets of West Germany's production of the latest jet aircraft and atomic cannons. The Krupp factory, according to U.S. plans, has already produced the first atomic cannon and will begin production. The Rhine-Prussian United Factory is producing napalm bombs. The former IG Farben factories in Mannheim and Ludwigshafen are also producing poison gas.

Meanwhile, according to a statement from the U.S. Department of Defense on September 2nd, the United States has stored weapons worth $500 million to equip a modern West German army. A U.S. Department of Defense spokesman announced that these weapons are far more than needed for the twelve West German divisions stipulated by the "European Defense Community" treaty. He also pointed out that these war materials do not require Congressional approval and can be delivered immediately with President Eisenhower's consent.

    美国指使西德加紧重新武装
    【新华社四日讯】在美国支持下西德正在加紧重新武装。
    据德意志通讯社报道：最近法国“国际论坛”揭露了西德生产最新式喷气飞机和原子炮的秘密。克虏伯工厂按照美国的计划，已经造成了第一座原子炮并将开始出产。莱因普鲁士联合工厂正在生产凝固汽油弹。在曼海姆和卢德韦希港的前法本工厂也正在生产毒气。
    同时，据美国国防部九月二日的声明，美国已经储存了价值五亿美元的武器，供装备一支现代化西德军之用。美国国防部发言人宣布：这些武器比“欧洲防务集团”条约规定的西德十二个师所需要的要多得多。他又指出：这些战争物资不必经国会批准，只要艾森豪威尔总统同意就可以立刻交付。
