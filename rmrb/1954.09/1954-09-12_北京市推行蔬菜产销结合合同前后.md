    In recent years, with the development of economic construction in the capital, the increase in population, and the continuous improvement of people's living standards, the demand for vegetables has also increased dramatically. Taking the transaction volume of the three famous vegetable distribution markets in Beijing, Tianqiao, Fuchengmen, and Guang'anmen, as 100 in 1951, the figure for 1952 was 130, for 1953 it was 209, and in the first half of this year, it increased by 54% compared with the same period last year. In order to meet the ever-growing needs of the people of the capital for vegetables, under the guidance and support of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Beijing Municipal People's Government, the planting area of suburban vegetables has also been expanded year by year. For example, taking the vegetable field planting area in 1949 as 100, the figure for 1950 was 171, for 1951 it was 190.6, for 1952 it was 231.5, for 1953 it was 255.6, and in the first half of this year, the vegetable planting area increased by 12% compared with the same period last year. The yield per unit area of vegetables has also been greatly improved. Ma Fuchang, a labor model in Beijing, produced an average of 12,058 jin of cucumbers per mu last year; Lu Zhenjia harvested 22,049 jin of tomatoes on 1.2 mu of land; the agricultural production cooperative in Huangtugang Township achieved a bumper harvest of over 3,500 jin per mu on nearly 300 mu of potatoes this year; and the state-owned Zhanghua Farm achieved a bumper harvest of over 18,000 jin per mu on 343 mu of Chinese cabbage last year. Therefore, the vegetable production in 1953 increased fourfold compared with 1950, reaching more than 630 million jin, plus the necessary inter-provincial and foreign sales adjustments, the supply of vegetables in Beijing has generally been able to meet the needs over the years.

    However, there are still many problems in the production and sales of vegetables, that is, there is still a certain distance between the varieties of vegetables and the quantity of seasonal production and the needs. This is mainly manifested in the fact that vegetable farmers do not know how many vegetables of this kind or that kind the citizens actually need. They often grow more of whatever vegetable was expensive the previous year, which leads to blindness in vegetable production. As a result, some vegetables are overproduced, the market is sluggish, and prices fall, causing losses to vegetable farmers; when production is too low, supply cannot meet demand, prices rise, and the burden on citizens increases. In 1951, eggplants sold at high prices, and vegetable farmers grew more eggplants the following year, exceeding market demand. As a result, they only sold for about 100 yuan per jin, and a lot of them rotted due to slow sales. In 1953, a lot of bok choy was planted, selling for only a little over 100 yuan per jin, and sometimes only for tens of yuan per jin, causing vegetable farmers to lose money. This year, vegetable farmers are afraid to plant too much, and the price this year is two to three times higher than last year. In the past, many speculative vegetable merchants and peddlers often took advantage of the blindness of vegetable production and demand to stir up trouble in the market, raising or lowering prices, and making profits of several times or even ten times in between, exploiting vegetable farmers and citizens.

    The production and marketing of vegetables are very seasonal. They are ripe, harvested, and sold at the same time. Often, the most intense season for vegetable production is also the season with the most vegetable sales. If vegetable farmers only focus on selling vegetables, they will delay production. Of course, agricultural production cooperatives and state-owned farms can sell vegetables in bulk, which saves a lot of labor compared to individual farmers selling vegetables. However, large-scale vegetable production requires a lot of personnel to promote the sales of vegetables produced by a production cooperative or a farm that produces millions of jin of vegetables a year. In the past, six of the twenty-four cadres of the state-owned Zhanghua Farm were often busy finding sales channels, and more than a dozen people had to be added during the peak vegetable production season. This not only affected production but also increased the cost of vegetables.

    For several years, everyone has been studying ways to solve these problems. As early as 1952, the Fengtai District Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Huangtugang Township Agricultural Production Cooperative signed a "consignment" vegetable combination contract. This contract only stipulated that the Supply and Marketing Cooperative would find sales channels on behalf of the cooperative. Of course, this can save the agricultural production cooperative some effort, but the unsold vegetables still belong to the agricultural production cooperative, and vegetables are not easy to store, are easy to rot, and have high losses. For example, in that year, more than 15,000 jin of potatoes from the Huangtugang Township Agricultural Production Cooperative rotted because they were not sold in time. Facts have proved that this "consignment" form of contract cannot promote the planning of production and better meet the needs of the market.

    Since the beginning of spring this year, on the basis of the great development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in vegetable-producing areas, the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, in accordance with the principle of "voluntary mutual benefit," has adopted the method of "typical demonstration, signing contracts in batches, and gradually promoting" to sign vegetable production and sales combination contracts with four state-owned farms and 151 agricultural production cooperatives, respectively. The contract generally adopts the form of "wholesale sales at market price," that is, according to the market price of the day, graded evaluation, and the Supply and Marketing Cooperative purchases all of them, and then the producer pays the Supply and Marketing Cooperative 5% of the commodity circulation fee (taxes, losses, etc.). This form of contract is in line with the current actual needs. Although it is inevitably affected by the price of the free market at first, when the Supply and Marketing Cooperative controls a certain source of vegetables, it can turn to lead the market, stabilize vegetable prices, and ensure supply.

    Now facts have proved that the implementation of this combination contract has a significant effect on promoting production, strengthening the combination of production and sales, and ensuring supply:

    For producers: (1) Because the sales of vegetables are guaranteed, the enthusiasm of vegetable farmers for production is encouraged. In the past, vegetable farmers had to worry about three things (production, selling vegetables, and buying production materials), which delayed a lot of effort. Sometimes, a large number of vegetables would rot because they could not find sales channels in time. Now, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative supplies production materials on time, and the Supply and Marketing Cooperative "wholesales" vegetables, so producers can concentrate on production and save a lot of manpower and animal power. After the state-owned Zhanghua Farm signed a vegetable combination contract, it reduced two sales personnel. The agricultural production cooperative in Baipenyao Township, Fengtai District, saved 93 man-days, 54 animal-days, and large cart man-days in the first month of implementing the contract.
  (2) Gradually cut off the connection between vegetable producers and the free market, so that vegetable farmers can get rid of the exploitation of speculative merchants, and initially overcome the spontaneous tendency of vegetable farmers to blindly pursue the free market. After the contract is signed, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative purchases vegetables from vegetable farmers at the prescribed price, which can maintain a relatively stable and reasonable price, and will never arbitrarily lower the price due to temporary sluggish sales, nor will it arbitrarily raise the price due to brisk sales. At the same time, producers can overcome the phenomenon of seasonal imbalance by supplying according to the plan and market needs. For example, before the "May Day" holiday this year, the market demand for vegetables increased, and the Supply and Marketing Cooperative agreed with the agricultural production cooperatives in advance to "double the supply of vegetables." The agricultural production cooperative in Baipenyao Township, Fengtai District, increased the daily supply of chives from more than 4,000 jin to more than 8,000 jin, and supplied 60,000 bunches of small radishes in one day when they were just harvested. Other agricultural production cooperatives also fulfilled this agreement. This played a great role in meeting the needs of citizens during the holidays and stabilizing vegetable prices. (3) It has strongly promoted the enthusiasm of farmers in vegetable-producing areas to participate in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Vegetable farmers go to the market to sell vegetables every day, and after seeing the advantages of production and sales combination contracts, such as saving labor, effort, and worry, guaranteeing sales, and reasonable prices, they have requested to organize production cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives to sign production and sales combination contracts.

    For the Supply and Marketing Cooperative: (1) After the Supply and Marketing Cooperative signed combination contracts with agricultural production cooperatives and state-owned farms, it has a reliable source of vegetables, gradually strengthens the planning of vegetable management, and facilitates the control and leadership of the market. For example, the spring cold in the suburbs of Beijing this year lasted longer, and the harvesting period of various vegetables was delayed, and vegetable production could not keep up with demand. However, because the Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the state-owned Zhanghua Farm signed a vegetable production and sales combination contract, the farm immediately transported a large number of cabbages to supply the market (a lot of them were sold abroad in previous years), thus meeting the needs of the market. Moreover, the price of cabbage during this period was 6% cheaper than the same period last year, and the prices of other vegetables also gradually stabilized accordingly. (2) It has reduced circulation links, reduced costs, and reduced the burden on consumers. After the implementation of combination contracts, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative established vegetable stations in industrial and mining areas, cultural areas, and residential areas, "taking materials locally and supplying locally," which not only facilitated buyers but also reduced the loss and handling costs of vegetable transportation, so that citizens can eat cheap and high-quality vegetables.

    Of course, there are still many shortcomings in the vegetable production and sales combination contracts signed by the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative and agricultural production cooperatives, as well as in the implementation of the contracts. That is: In the implementation of the contract, some agricultural production cooperatives and state-owned farms do not pay attention to the specifications and quality of vegetables, and some agricultural production cooperatives have even used inferior goods to pass off as good goods, which has affected the credibility of both parties with consumers. Some agricultural production cooperatives blindly pursue high prices, and after signing the contract, they do not abide by the contract and do not sell their products to the Supply and Marketing Cooperative but sell them to private merchants. Some staff members of some Supply and Marketing Cooperative vegetable stations still have a strong purely profit-seeking point of view, deliberately evaluating lower prices, and have not well implemented the principle of mastering graded pricing and preferential prices for superior grades. These all need to be educated and improved on both sides.

    北京市推行蔬菜产销结合合同前后
    祝遵璜
    近年来，随着首都经济建设的发展，人口的增加，人民生活水平日益提高，蔬菜的需要量也急剧地增加着。北京有名的天桥、阜成门、广安门三大蔬菜集散市场的蔬菜成交量，以一九五一年为一百，则一九五二年为一百三十，一九五三年为二百零九，今年上半年又较去年同期增加百分之五十四。为着适应首都人民对蔬菜日益增长的需要，在中共北京市委和北京市人民政府的指导与扶植下，郊区蔬菜的播种面积也逐年都有扩大。如以一九四九年菜地播种面积为一百，则一九五○年为一百七十一，一九五一年为一百九十点六，一九五二年为二百三十一点五，一九五三年为二百五十五点六，今年上半年蔬菜播种面积又较去年同期扩大了百分之十二。而蔬菜单位面积产量也大大地提高了。北京市劳动模范马富长，去年平均每亩地生产了一万二千零五十八斤黄瓜；卢振家在一亩二分土地上收获了二万二千零四十九斤西红柿；黄土岗乡农业生产合作社今年近三百亩土豆，取得每亩平均三千五百斤以上的丰收；国营彰化农场去年三百四十三亩大白菜，获得了每亩平均一万八千多斤的大丰收。因而一九五三年的蔬菜产量较一九五零年增加了四倍，达到六亿三千多万斤，再加上必要时内运外销的调剂，北京市蔬菜的供应历年来大体上还能适应需要。
    但是，在蔬菜产销过程中也还存在着许多问题，这就是蔬菜的品种上和季节的生产数量上，和需要之间还有一定的距离。这主要表现在菜农不知道市民究竟需要多少这样的蔬菜或那样的蔬菜。他们常常是看头年什么菜贵，来年就多种什么菜，这样就造成了蔬菜生产的盲目性，结果有些蔬菜生产过剩，市场滞销，价格下跌，菜农遭受损失；生产过少时，供不应求，价格上涨，增加了市民负担。一九五一年茄子卖价高，次年菜农就多种了茄子，超过了市场需要，结果每斤只卖一百元左右，由于滞销，还烂掉了很多。一九五三年小白菜种的多，只卖一百多元一斤，有时只卖几十元一斤，菜农赔了钱，今年菜农不敢多种了，今年价格比去年贵了两三倍。过去，许多投机菜商和小贩，就常常利用蔬菜生产和需要的盲目性，乘机在市场上兴风作浪，抬价或压价，转手之间即牟利数倍以至十数倍，剥削菜农和市民。
    蔬菜的生产和运销是有很大的季节性的。它是边成熟、边收获、边出卖，往往在蔬菜生产最紧张的季节，也是卖菜最多的季节。菜农如果只顾了卖菜，就耽误了生产。当然，农业生产合作社和国营农场的蔬菜，可以大宗出卖，比单干户卖菜要节省很多人工。但大面积的蔬菜生产，一个生产合作社或一个农场一年要生产成千百万斤的蔬菜，推销这些蔬菜也就需要很多人员，国营彰化农场全场二十四个干部，过去就有六个人经常忙于找销路，到蔬菜盛产期还要增加十几个人。这不仅影响了生产，也增加了蔬菜的成本。
    几年来，大家一直在研究解决这些问题的办法。早在一九五二年，丰台区供销合作社和黄土岗乡农业生产合作社订了“代销”蔬菜结合合同，这种合同只是规定供销合作社给代找销路。当然这可以省去农业生产合作社的一些工夫，可是推销不出去的仍归农业生产合作社，而蔬菜不易储藏，容易腐烂，损耗很大。譬如黄土岗乡农业生产合作社的土豆，那一年就因为没有及时推销掉，烂掉了一万五千多斤。事实证明，这种“代销”形式的合同，还不能促进生产的计划性，更好地供应市场的需要。
    今年入春以来，在菜区互助合作运动大发展的基础上，北京市供销合作总社根据“自愿互利”的原则，采取“典型示范、分批签订、逐步推广”的方法，分别与四个国营农场和一百五十一个农业生产合作社签订了蔬菜产销结合合同。合同普遍采用了
  “随市价包销”的形式，即根据当日市场价格，分级评价，由供销社全部收购，然后由生产者付给供销合作社百分之五的商品流转费（税金、损耗等）。这种形式的合同，是切合目前实际需要的。它起初虽不免要受自由市场价格的影响，可是当供销合作社掌握一定菜源后，就可以转而领导市场，平稳菜价，保证供应。
    现在事实证明：推行这种结合合同，对促进生产，加强产销结合，保证供应，具有重大的作用：
    对生产者来说：（一）由于蔬菜销路有了保障，鼓舞了菜农生产积极性。过去菜农要操三份心
  （生产、卖菜、买生产资料），耽误很多工夫，有时还因一时找不到销路而使蔬菜大批腐烂。现在，生产资料由供销合作社按时供应，蔬菜由供销合作社“包销”，生产者就可以集中精力安心生产，还可以大大地节省人力和畜力。国营彰化农场订了蔬菜结合合同后，就减少了两个推销人员。丰台区白盆窑乡农业生产合作社在执行合同的第一个月当中，就省了九十三个人工、五十四个畜工和大车工。
  （二）逐步割断了蔬菜生产者与自由市场的联系，使菜农摆脱了投机奸商的剥削，并初步克服了菜农盲目追逐自由市场的自发倾向。订立合同后，供销合作社按照规定的牌价收购菜农的蔬菜，能保持比较平稳而合理的价格，绝不会因一时滞销，而任意压价、也不会因畅销而任意抬价。同时，生产者按照计划和市场的需要供应，就可以克服季节失调的现象。比如今年“五一”节前，市场对蔬菜的需要增加，供销合作社事先就与各农业生产合作社约定“加倍送菜”，丰台区白盆窑乡农业生产合作社就由每天送四千多斤韭菜增加到八千多斤，在小萝卜刚收获时，一天就送了六万把，其他农业生产合作社也都履行了这个约定。这对满足市民节日需要、稳定菜价起了很大的作用。（三）有力地促进菜区农民参加互助合作运动的积极性。菜农们每天到市上卖菜，亲眼看到产销结合合同省工、省事、省心，销路保险、价格合理等好处后，都纷纷要求组织生产合作社和供销合作社订立产销结合合同。
    对供销合作社来说：（一）供销合作社与农业生产合作社和国营农场订立了结合合同后，就有了可靠的菜源，逐步加强经营蔬菜的计划性，便于控制和领导市场，比如今年北京市郊春寒时间较长，各种蔬菜收获期推迟，蔬菜生产赶不上需要，但由于供销合作社和国营彰化农场订立了蔬菜产销结合合同，该农场即把大量洋白菜运来供应市场（往年外销很多），因而满足了市场的需要，并且这一时期洋白菜价格比去年同期便宜百分之六，其它菜价也逐渐相应平稳。（二）减少了流通环节，降低了费用，减轻了消费者的负担。推行结合合同后，供销合作社在工矿区、文化区和居民区建立了菜站，“就地取材，就地供应”，既便利了购买者，又减少了蔬菜往返运转的损耗和手续费用，因而使市民可以吃到价廉物美的蔬菜。
    当然，北京市供销合作社和农业生产合作社订立的蔬菜产销结合合同以及在执行合同中，还存在许多缺点。这就是：在执行合同中，有些农业生产合作社和国营农场不注意蔬菜的规格和质量，有些农业生产合作社还曾以次货充好货，以致影响了双方对消费者的信誉。也有的农业生产合作社盲目追逐高价，在订立合同后，竟不遵守合同，不把产品卖给供销合作社而卖给了私商。有些供销合作社菜站有些工作人员还有着浓厚的单纯营利观点，评价时有意评低，对掌握分级论价，优级优价的原则也没有很好贯彻。这些都需要对双方进行教育和加以改进的。
