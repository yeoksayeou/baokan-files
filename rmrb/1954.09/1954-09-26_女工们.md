Women Workers

Tremendous Changes

Over the past five years, the lives of the Chinese people have undergone tremendous changes. This can be seen from the changes in the lives of women workers in a factory. For example, in the past, working people were like cattle and horses all day long; today, working people are managing national affairs. Isn't this a tremendous change? Among the deputies to the National People's Congress, there are many worker representatives, and many are women workers or women workers by origin. One of these representatives is named Hang Peilan. She is a weaver at the Shanghai No. 1 State-owned Cotton Textile Factory and a national textile industry labor model. Last year, she studied at the Workers and Peasants' Accelerated Secondary School affiliated with Renmin University of China in Beijing and is now discussing national affairs in Huairen Hall in the capital. Over the past five years, Hang Peilan has undergone tremendous changes in politics, culture, and life. Similarly, the lives of many women workers in the Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Factory have also undergone tremendous changes in the past five years.

For example, when it comes to learning culture, the women workers in the factory all know that to understand national affairs, participate in production management, and improve technology, one must have culture. Like Hang Peilan's good friend Zhu Fadi, she is a textile industry labor model, promoted from worker to deputy director of the workshop, and also a representative of the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress. Two years ago, she was illiterate. When the newspaper asked her to write an article, she was very happy but unable to do it. Many volunteers wrote letters to her, and she had to ask others to read them to her and write replies on her behalf. Last year, the leadership sent her to an accelerated literacy school. Before long, she had the cultural level of a third-grade primary school student. Now, she can write simple replies and read the Labor Daily. She often says to people: "In the past, seeing production reports was like meeting a stranger, it frowned at me, but now seeing reports is so affectionate!" Shen Xiaomei, an old worker in the spinning workshop, was also illiterate. After entering the accelerated literacy class, she learned more than 2,000 characters, just like a blind person seeing the blue sky, finding everything amazing. When she went home, she would stop and read the notices on the road, and walk over and read the slogans, enjoying it immensely. A road that could be walked in fifteen minutes took her two hours.

In the factory, more and more people like them are appearing every day. After work every day, the more than ten classrooms of the staff and workers' spare-time school are filled with more than a thousand male and female workers. There are primary, intermediate, and advanced students here. Shi Xiaomei, the female factory director who came from a worker background, and Hang Huilan, the deputy secretary of the Party committee, are both students at the spare-time school. This year, one hundred people were admitted to spare-time middle school, twenty-two to accelerated middle school, twenty-one to textile technical school, and three to the East China Textile Engineering Institute.

New Family Life

The family life of women workers has also undergone great changes. Tang Chundi, a woman worker in the same workshop as Hang Peilan, is the daughter of a carpenter. Her parents died before she grew up, so at the age of twelve, she became a child bride in the Du family. The Du family also made a living by working, so when Chundi came to their house, she was sent to a silk reeling factory to work. At such a young age, she worked twelve hours a day in the factory. When she returned home in the evening, she had to wash clothes for the whole family, and she had to get up at three or four in the morning to cook breakfast for the whole family. At first, her husband, Du Wanjin, saw that she was working too hard and helped her. However, when Du Wanjin's father and mother saw this, they glared, pounded the benches, and slapped the table, saying: "Where is there a man doing housework! Put it down and let her do it, don't be a sissy." After that, Du Wanjin even had Chundi bring his washing water to him. And the old man and old woman would vent their anger on Chundi when they encountered unsatisfactory things such as not earning enough money or not being able to get enough grain, and often provoked Du Wanjin to beat Chundi. They said:
  "The little daughter-in-law is rising in status, and her strength is as great as an ox. If you don't beat her into submission now, you won't be able to handle her when we die." Later, Du Wanjin would beat Chundi half to death if he encountered anything unsatisfactory. Tang Chundi lived like this for twelve years.

After liberation, Du Wanjin was educated by the factory and no longer quarreled with Chundi. Their monthly wages were enough for the eight people in the family to live on. Although life was stable, Grandma Du still found fault with her daughter-in-law. One day, Chundi said to her husband: "We are actively producing in the factory, and we should have harmony at home." Du Wanjin said: "How do you think we should do it?" Chundi said: "The first thing is your mother. She doesn't listen to me now. You can talk to her more. If we respect her, she will be happy to help us take care of the children, wouldn't that be good?" Du Wanjin did just that, chatting with his mother whenever he had time. When the neighborhood held meetings to discuss the Marriage Law, he also asked his mother to listen. Although the old lady didn't say a word about the many new ideas she heard outside in front of her son and daughter-in-law, she said to her old neighbors: "We were not good to our daughter-in-law in the past, she is also a person!" Gradually, she also changed. She used to find it troublesome to take care of even one grandson, but now she takes care of four, with only the youngest one being taken to the nursery by Chundi. When her son and daughter-in-law received their wages, they handed them all over to her to manage. She didn't dare to spend a penny recklessly, and often prepared some good side dishes for her son and daughter-in-law to eat. Every Sunday, her son often read a few paragraphs from the newspaper to her, and her daughter-in-law would ask her to go out and play. A harmonious and warm family was formed. Whenever this issue is discussed, Tang Chundi's answer is always: "Only today can we have such close family relationships."

Proper Marriage

In the old society, matchmaking required "bamboo doors to match bamboo doors, and wooden doors to match wooden doors." If a woman worker in a yarn factory wanted to find a relatively well-off family, they would look down on you for being a worker and not want you. If you found a worker, you would worry that if you had several children, your mouths would be hanging open. In addition, marriage was not free, and many women workers lived alone for most of their lives. Zhou Ainan, a woman worker in the weaving workshop, is forty years old this year. In the past, people didn't call her by her real name, they all called her "old maid." When she was young, she saw a neighbor named Caisu being beaten and crying by her husband after she got married, and she felt very sad, often crying with Caisu. She felt that marriage was meaningless, and it was better not to get married. During the Japanese occupation, her father and mother both died of overwork, leaving her with five younger sisters, two younger brothers, and two dilapidated houses. She worked alone in Shanghai to help her younger siblings get by. People always have feelings, and after the age of thirty, she often felt that if she didn't get married, how would she end up in the future? However, when she thought of Caisu being beaten, of her parents being exhausted to death by their many children, and of the lives of her seven younger siblings in the countryside, her heart would cool down. In the factory, when people asked about her marriage, she would put on a straight face and walk away. After liberation, everything changed. Workers' lives were guaranteed, and the government did not allow husbands to oppress their wives. Caisu also always came home happy. She also told Ainan that after her husband was educated by the government, not only did he not beat her anymore, but he also helped her with some housework. Ainan saw it in her eyes and remembered it in her heart. Later, some of her younger sisters got married, and her younger brothers were also allocated land after the land reform, and their lives became stable. The "old maid" couldn't help but consider her own marriage again. Many workers in the workshop also cared about her, but everyone was afraid to speak, fearing to hurt her heart. One day, Yin Axue boldly asked her: "Old maid, it's okay to get married now that we are liberated. If you don't have a partner, we can introduce you to one, guaranteed to be good." The old maid laughed when she heard this. Soon, the old maid began to fall in love with Zhang Jinmin. Later, they got married. Now, every evening, Zhang Jinmin is often seen riding his bicycle to the factory gate to pick up the "old maid" to go home.

In the past few years, many people who were called "old maids" have one after another become "older sisters-in-law."

As for the young girls, they naturally don't need to be afraid of wolves in front and tigers behind. Liu Baoling from the cloth workshop met Tang Jian, a worker at the steam turbine factory, during a youth worker get-together organized by the Youth League Committee the year before last. Tang Jian was very straightforward and simple. The two of them got along very well and fell in love. They got married last year. There are still more than a dozen young male and female workers in the factory who are dating.

Happy Second Generation

There are several thousand women workers in the Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Factory. When women workers get married, they will have children. Last year, an average of fifty-five children were born each month. So far this year, an average of more than sixty children are born each month.

The increase in children is faster than the expansion of nurseries. Last year, a new nursery that can accommodate four hundred children was built opposite the factory's small garden. Every day, the clinic sends a special doctor to examine the bodies of these little guys. Most of the children are chubby.

Before liberation, many women workers were afraid of having children: firstly, because there was no one to take care of the children after they were born, and secondly, because they could not afford to raise too many. During the Japanese occupation, it was even more infuriating to be fired when pregnant. Zhu Fadi had eight children before liberation, only one of whom survived, and this one was born just before liberation. She had two children after liberation, and they both grew up like little tigers. Strangely enough, many women workers had not had children for a long time before liberation, but gave birth soon after liberation. Xu Fengying, from the spinning workshop, had been married for nine years without children. She went to the hospital to cure her gynecological disease the year before last, and gave birth to a child not long ago. Chen Yinzhen, who is in the same workshop as Hang Peilan, had been married for thirteen years and gave birth to her first son last year. The couple was overjoyed and even dyed many red eggs according to the old custom to announce the good news. The nursery staff joked with the mothers: "Okay, you deliberately want to make things difficult for the factory director! The new house has just been built, and a new batch of 'fresh troops' has arrived, filling the house!"

Two Ideals

Every textile worker has her own ideal. They usually don't talk about it much, but when they are idle, the most trusted sisters get together and talk about it. Zhang Xiulan, a weaving worker, said: "You know, the cloth produced by our textile factories across the country only averages nine feet per person. I don't know how many textile factories the country will open in the future. I want to become a textile expert." Zhu Ping, a woman worker in the spinning workshop, is wholeheartedly thinking of becoming an actress. Li Yuzhen, a woman worker in the spinning workshop, was sitting quietly at first, but finally she said: "I don't want to go anywhere, I just want... to work hard in the factory." The others quickly followed her tone and said: "Learn from Hang Peilan and become a labor model." Then, everyone laughed for a while.

They are not just talking about it. Zhang Xiulan has raised her cultural level to the level of a senior primary school student in the past few years, and this year she was admitted to the accelerated middle school affiliated to Tongji University. Her first choice is to study textile technology. She said: "The problem in the future is to be determined to delve into it." Zhu Ping hasn't gone to act in any movies yet, but she has become a "famous actress" in the factory, and she is not willing to fall behind in production. She said: "I am a worker, and if I want to be an actress, I must perform the excellent qualities of the working class. If I don't do well in production now, how can I perform the workers well in the future?" Li Yuzhen has become an advanced producer in the workshop in the past one or two years.

In our country, women workers have lofty and beautiful ideals, and they also have the conditions to realize these ideals. Talking about the present also reminds people of the past. Did women workers have ideals in the past? Yes, they did. What were their ideals? Just one example is enough. Let's talk about Zhang Xiulan. She entered the factory at the age of fourteen. Seeing how hard the work was and how she was looked down upon, she planned: there is no way now, I will work for a few years, and then marry a "good man" and not live this short-lived life. Now, when Zhang Xiulan talks about this, she calls it a "pitiful ideal." But even this "pitiful ideal" could not be realized in the old society.

Society has changed, the lives of women workers have changed, and the ideals of women workers have also changed. Hang Peilan is an epitome of thousands of women workers. Thousands of women workers are living like Hang Peilan. (Attached picture)

    女工们
    孟凡夏
    天大的变化
    五年来，我国人民的生活起了天大的变化，这从一个工厂的女工生活所起的变化也可以看出来。比如说，从前劳动人民一天到晚像牛马一样；今天，劳动人民管起国家大事来了，这不是天大的变化吗？在全国人民代表大会的代表中，有很多工人代表，而且有许多女工或女工出身的代表，其中有一个代表叫杭佩兰。她是国营上海第一棉纺织厂的织布女工，也是全国纺织工业劳动模范，去年到北京中国人民大学附设工农速成中学学习，现在在首都的怀仁堂讨论着国家大事。五年来，杭佩兰在政治、文化、生活各方面都有了天大的变化。同样，上海国棉一厂里的许许多多女工，五年来的生活也是有了天大的变化。
    比如学文化，工厂里的女工都晓得：要知道国家大事，要参加生产管理和提高技术，都要有文化。像杭佩兰的好朋友朱法弟，她是纺织工业劳动模范，是从工人中提拔的车间副主任，也是上海市人民代表大会代表。两年前，她不识字，报社请她写文章，她虽很高兴，但做不到。很多志愿军写信给她，她得请别人读给她听和代她写回信。去年，领导上把她送进速成识字学校，没多久，她就具有小学三年级的文化程度。现在，她已能写简单的复信了，能读劳动报了。她常常见了人就说：从前看见生产报表像碰到陌生人，它对我扳面孔，现在看见报表可亲热啦。细纱间的老工人沈小妹原来也是一字不识，进速成识字班后认识了二千多字，真好比瞎子见青天，看到什么都稀奇。她回家时，在马路上看到布告就停下来念念，看到标语又走过去读读，而且读得津津有味。一刻钟可以走完的路她竟走了两个钟头。
    在厂里，像她们这样的人一天天多起来。每天下了工，职工业余学校的十多个教室里，满满的坐着一千多个男女工人。这里有初级、中级和高级学生，工人出身的女厂长史小妹和党委副书记杭惠兰，都是业余学校的学生。今年有一百人考进了业余中学，二十二人进了速成中学，二十一人进了纺织技术学校，还有三人进了华东纺织工学院。
    新的家庭生活
    女工的家庭生活也起了很大变化。和杭佩兰同一车间的女工唐春弟，是个木匠的女儿，没长大成人父母就死了，于是十二岁就到杜家做童养媳。杜家也是个靠劳动吃饭的人家，所以春弟到他家，就被送进缫丝厂做工。年纪那样小每天在厂里做十二个钟头工；晚上回家还要给一家大小洗衣服，早上三、四点钟又要起来烧早饭给全家吃。开始时，她丈夫杜万金见她太辛苦，帮帮她的忙。但是，杜万金的父亲、母亲一看见，就吹胡子瞪眼睛，拍板凳打桌子，说：“哪里有男子汉做家务事的！快放下给她做，别婆婆妈妈的。”这一来，杜万金连洗脸水都要春弟端到面前了。而老头子、老太婆碰到像赚钱不够用、户口米挤不到等不称心的事，就把气往春弟身上出，常常挑唆杜万金打春弟。他们说：
  “小媳妇出了头，力气大如牛。你现在不把她打服贴了，等我们死了，你就弄不过她了。”以后杜万金碰到一点不如意事，就把春弟打个半死，唐春弟就这样的过了十二年。
    解放后，杜万金经过厂里教育，再也不和春弟吵架了。他俩每月的工资足够家里八个人生活。生活虽然安定了，但杜老奶奶还要找事跟媳妇吵嘴。一天，春弟跟丈夫说：“我们在厂里生产积极，家里也要过得和和气气的才好。”杜万金说：“你看怎么过法呢？”春弟说：“头一个就是你妈妈。现在我讲话她是不听的，你可以多和她谈谈，我们尊重她，她高兴了，就会帮我们带带孩子，这不就好了吗？”杜万金就这样做了，一有功夫就跟他妈妈谈天，里弄里开会讨论婚姻法时，他也叫妈妈去听听。老太太虽然不在儿子、媳妇面前说一句在外面听来的许多新道理，但却跟邻居老同伴们说：“我们老早对媳妇是不好的，人家也是一个人呀！”慢慢的，她也变了。以前她带一个孙子也嫌麻烦，现在她带四个，只有最小的一个由春弟带进托儿所。儿子媳妇领到了工资，全部交给她支配。她一个钱也舍不得乱用，经常备些好小菜留给儿子媳妇吃。每逢星期天，儿子常常读几段报纸给她听听，媳妇则叫她出去玩玩。一个和睦、温暖的家庭形成了。每当谈起这个问题，唐春弟的回答总是：“只有在今天，才会有像我们这样亲密的家庭关系。”
    正当的婚姻
    在旧社会里，做亲要“笆门对笆门，板门对板门”。纱厂女工要想找个比较宽裕的人家，人家嫌你是工人，不要你；找个工人吧，又怕养了几个小孩，嘴巴就得挂起来；再加上婚姻不能自主，很多女工都是孤孤单单的过了大半辈子。织布间的女工周爱囡，今年四十岁了。过去大家不喊她的真名字，都叫她“老姑娘”。她在年轻的时候，看到邻居一个叫彩素的女孩子出嫁以后，常常被丈夫打得哭回来，自己也很伤心，常常陪着彩素哭一场。她觉得结婚没意思，还是不结婚的好。日本鬼子统治时期，她的爸爸和妈妈都因操劳过度病死了，留给她的是五个妹妹、两个小弟弟和两间破房子。她一个人在上海做工，还要帮助弟弟妹妹过日子。人总是有感情的，上了三十岁以后，她常常感到不结婚将来怎么了结啊？可是，她一想到彩素挨打的样子，想到自己父母因子女多累死了，想到乡下七个弟妹的生活，心就冷下来了。在厂里，人家一问起她的婚姻事，她就脸一板走开了。解放后，什么都变了，工人生活有了保障，政府不允许丈夫压迫妻子。彩素回家时也总是欢天喜地的。她还对爱囡说，她丈夫经政府教育后，不但不打她了，还帮她做些家务事哩。爱囡看在眼里，记在心里。后来有的妹妹出嫁了，弟弟在土地改革后也分到了地，生活安定下来了，“老姑娘”不由得又考虑起自己的婚事来。车间里很多工人也关心她，可是大家都不敢讲，怕刺伤她的心。有一天印阿雪，大着胆子问她：“老姑娘，解放了，好结婚啦。要是没有对象，我们替你介绍一个，包管好。”老姑娘一听“噗刺”一笑。不久，老姑娘就开始和张金民恋爱，以后，他俩就结婚了。现在，每到晚上，在厂门口常常看到张金民骑着脚踏车来接“老姑娘”回家。
    以前很多被人叫做“老姑娘”的，这几年都一个跟着一个变成“大嫂子”了。
    至于年青的姑娘们自然用不着前怕狼后怕虎的了。布房间的刘宝玲，在前年青年团委组织的青年工人联欢时，认识了汽轮机厂的工人唐剑。唐剑很直爽、朴实。他们两人很谈得拢，以后就恋爱起来。并且在去年结婚了。厂里还有十几对青年男女工人正在谈恋爱。
    幸福的第二代
    上海国棉一厂有几千女工。女工结了婚，就要生孩子。去年每月平均生五十五个小孩，今年到现在为止，每月平均生六十多个。
    孩子的增加比托儿所的扩大快的多。去年，在工厂小花园的对面，又新造一所可托四百个孩子的托儿所。每天，医务室都要派专门医生为这些小家伙检查身体，大多数小孩都是胖胖的。
    解放以前，很多女工都怕生小孩：一来是生了小孩没人照管，二来是生多了也养不活；在日本鬼子统治时期更是气煞人，怀了孕还要被开除。朱法弟在解放前生了八个小孩，只有一个活着，而这一个还是快要解放时生的。她解放后生了两个小孩，都长得像小老虎一样。说来真奇怪，有很多女工，解放前很久都不生小孩，解放后不久就生了。像细纱间的徐凤英，结婚九年没有孩子，前年到医院治好了妇女病，不久前就生了一个小孩。和杭佩兰同一车间的陈银珍，结婚十三年，去年才生第一个儿子，夫妻俩欢喜得了不得，还按老规矩染了许多红蛋送人报喜。托儿所的保育员跟妈妈们开玩笑说：“好哇，你们存心跟厂长为难哪！新房子才造好，又来了一批‘生力军’，把房子占满啦！”
    两种理想
    每个纺织女工都有自己的理想。这个，她们平常是不大会说的，但当闲着没事的时候，最知心姊妹一碰头，就谈论起来啦。织布女工张秀兰说：“你可晓得，现在我们全国纺织厂出的布，平均下来每人只摊到九尺，将来国家不知要开多少纺织厂呢。我呀，就想做个纺织专家。”细纱间女工朱萍则一心一意想做个演员。细纱间女工李玉珍起先坐在一旁不响，最后她才说：“我呀，什么地方也不想去，就想………在厂里好好做生活。”另外的人连忙接着她的口气说：“学杭佩兰的样子，做个劳动模范。”接着，大家都嘻嘻哈哈地笑了一阵。
    她们可不是说着玩的。张秀兰这几年已把自己的文化程度提高到高小程度，今年又考进了同济大学附属速成中学，她的第一志愿是学纺织技术。她说：“以后的问题呀，是要下决心往里钻。”朱萍现在还没去演什么电影，但已成为厂里的“名演员”了，而且在生产上也不肯落在人后。她说：“我是工人，做演员就要把工人阶级的优秀品质演出来；现在没把生产搞好，将来怎能把工人演好呢？”李玉珍呢，最近一两年内已成为车间的先进生产者。
    在我们国家里女工们有远大美丽的理想，也有实现这种理想的条件。谈起现在，也使人想起从前，从前女工有没有理想呢？有的。有什么理想呢？只要举一个例子就够了，就说张秀兰吧，她十四岁进了工厂，看到做工这样苦，又被人瞧不起，她就打算：现在没有办法，就做他几年工，将来嫁一个“好好叫”的人，不做这短命生活了。现在，张秀兰一谈起这个来，就把它叫做“可怜的理想”。可是旧社会里，就连这个“可怜的理想”也不能实现啊。
    社会变了，女工生活变了，女工的理想也变了。杭佩兰是千百个女工的缩影。千百个女工像杭佩兰一样的生活着。（附图片）
