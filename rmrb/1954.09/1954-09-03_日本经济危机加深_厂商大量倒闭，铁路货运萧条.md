    Japan's Economic Crisis Deepens
    Numerous Factory Closures, Railway Freight Declines
   [Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd dispatch] News from Tokyo: Due to the deepening economic crisis, a large number of Japanese factories have closed down, and railway freight is in decline.

    According to a survey by the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Japan, the number of factories and commercial firms that went bankrupt nationwide in July reached as many as 1,241, an increase of 190 compared to June, which is an unprecedented record in Japan. Among these bankrupt firms, 64 percent were in the manufacturing sector. Regionally, the situation in Osaka, a major textile manufacturing center in Japan, was the most severe. The number of bankrupt firms in Osaka in July was almost three times the total number of bankrupt firms from January to March. The Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry believes that the reason for such a large number of bankruptcies is due to falling prices and a sluggish market.

    In addition, according to the "Asahi Shimbun" report, Japan National Railways, which controls the main railway lines in Japan, has experienced a significant reduction in freight volume due to the sluggish state of the production sector. Freight volume in May was 160,000 tons less than the original plan, and in June it was 530,000 tons less than the original plan. As a result, revenue decreased by 370 million yen from April to June. On July 4th, a single day, a total of 4,500 unused freight cars were stored at stations across the country.

    日本经济危机加深
    厂商大量倒闭，铁路货运萧条
   【新华社二日讯】东京消息：由于经济危机日益加深，日本厂商大量倒闭，铁路货运萧条。
    据日本大阪商工会议所的调查，七月份，日本全国倒闭的工厂、商行共达一千二百四十一家之多，比六月份增加了一百九十家，这是日本空前的纪录。在这些倒闭的厂商中，百分之六十四是制造部门。就地区来说，日本主要的纺织制造业中心大阪市情况最为严重。大阪市七月份厂商倒闭数目几乎等于一月到三月期间厂商倒闭总数的三倍。大阪商工会议所的调查认为，如此大量倒闭的原因是由于物价下跌和市场萧条。
    另外，据“朝日新闻”报道，掌握日本全国铁路干线的日本国营铁道公司，因为生产部门处于萧条状态，货运量大大减少。五月份货运比原订计划减少十六万吨，六月份比原订计划减少五十三万吨。因此，四月到六月期间，收入减少了三亿七千万日元，七月四日一天中，全国各站存放未用的车皮共达四千五百辆。
