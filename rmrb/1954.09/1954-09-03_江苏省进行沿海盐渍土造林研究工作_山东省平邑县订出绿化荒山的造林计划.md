    Jiangsu Province is conducting afforestation research on coastal saline soil.
    Pingyi County, Shandong Province, has formulated an afforestation plan for greening barren mountains.
    The Jiangsu Provincial Coastal Shelterbelt Experimental Station has begun research and experimentation on afforestation in the saline soil of northern Jiangsu. Northern Jiangsu comprises eleven counties and cities, including Qidong and Haimen, with a coastline of over 1,200 li. Each year, agricultural losses due to wind damage amount to 20% to 30%. In August 1952, the local Party and People's Government organized a group of experts to conduct a comprehensive survey and initially formulated a plan to construct over 80,000 mu of primary shelterbelts and key shelterbelt networks. Small-scale farmland shelterbelt networks have also begun to be built on farms in Shanghai, Dongxin, and Huaihai. However, due to the high salt content of the soil in the coastal area, the survival rate of seedlings is very low. To solve this problem, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the Shanghai Institute of Plant Physiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, jointly established the Jiangsu Provincial Coastal Shelterbelt Experimental Station. In June, they began conducting research and experimentation on seedling cultivation and afforestation in saline soil. To further solve the methods of seedling cultivation and afforestation in saline soil, the experimental station is currently conducting measurements of soil salinity and water content in the planned afforestation areas along the coast and is conducting in-depth investigations and research to summarize the experience of the masses.

    Barren mountains in Pingyi County, Shandong, account for approximately 37% of the county's total area. In recent years, the county has afforested over 95,000 mu, initially achieving the effect of soil and water conservation and water source conservation. In order to carry out afforestation work in a planned manner, the County People's Government has formulated a specific afforestation plan to eliminate barren mountains. According to the results of a comprehensive survey of barren mountains in the first half of this year, the county has 840,000 mu of barren mountains. After deducting areas with severe soil erosion that cannot be utilized in the short term and pastures reserved for the development of cattle and sheep, there are still over 330,000 mu of land suitable for afforestation. Based on the local manpower and material conditions in the mountainous areas, the county government plans to afforest all 330,000 mu of suitable land within the next six years, starting this winter. According to the different natural conditions in various areas, it is planned to construct 250,000 mu of water source conservation forests and timber forests in the mountainous areas of Mengshan, Sikaishan, and Tianbaoshan; 14,000 mu of shelterbelts along the riverbanks of the Junhe River and Tangcunhe River; and 60,000 mu of special economic forests (sapium sebiferum, eucommia ulmoides), fruit tree forests, and tussah silkworm forests in areas with deep topsoil and abandoned terraces; and mobilize the masses to plant trees in gaps in the plains, requiring each person to plant and keep alive at least two trees each year, to gradually achieve the goal of "villages with forests, households with trees" and self-sufficiency in civilian timber.

    江苏省进行沿海盐渍土造林研究工作
    山东省平邑县订出绿化荒山的造林计划
    江苏省沿海防护林试验站开始进行苏北沿海盐渍土的造林研究试验工作。苏北沿海有启东、海门等十一个县市，海岸线长一千二百多华里，每年因遭受风害而造成农业损失达百分之二十至三十。一九五二年八月间，当地党和人民政府曾组织一批专家进行了一次全面勘查，初步制订了营造八万多亩基干防护林带和重点防护林网的计划。并在上海、东辛、淮海等农场开始营造小面积农田防护林网。但因沿海一带的土壤含盐量很重，树苗成活率很低。为解决这个问题，今年江苏省农林厅与上海中国科学院植物生理研究所联合成立了江苏省沿海防护林试验站，于六月间开始进行盐渍土的育苗造林等研究试验工作。为了进一步解决盐渍土育苗造林的方法，目前试验站正在沿海计划造林地带进行土壤含盐量及含水的测定；并深入调查研究、总结群众经验。（陈午生）

    山东平邑县的荒山，约占全县总面积的百分之三十七。近几年来全县造林九万五千多亩，已初步获得保持水土、涵养水源的效果。该县人民政府为了有计划地开展造林工作，特制订了消灭荒山的具体造林计划。根据今年上半年荒山全面测量的结果，全县实有荒山八十四万亩，除去因水土冲刷严重，短时期不能利用和留出供作发展牛羊的牧场外，尚有宜林地三十三万余亩，县府根据山区人力物力等条件，计划自今年冬季开始，在今后六年的时间内，将三十三万亩宜林地全部营造成林。根据各地不同的自然条件，计划在蒙山、四开山、天宝山等山区营造水源涵养林和用材林二十五万亩；在浚河、唐村河等河流沿岸河滩营造防护林一万四千亩；在荒山土层深厚的地处和停耕的梯田营造特种经济林（乌桕、杜仲）、果树林、柞蚕林六万亩；在平原地区普遍发动群众进行隙地植林，要求每人每年至少栽活两棵树，以逐步达到“村村有林、家家有树”和民用木材自给的目的。
