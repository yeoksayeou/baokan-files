Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 19th. Xinjiang Province's livestock has been increasing year by year. This year, it has again completed the livestock increase plan, with an increase of 15.4% in large and small livestock compared to 1953. The lives of nearly 600,000 people of Kazakh, Kirgiz, Mongolian, Tajik, and other ethnic groups who depend on animal husbandry for their livelihood are gradually becoming prosperous.

	Over the past five years, the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government have widely and deeply implemented the animal husbandry policy of "no struggle, no division, no class demarcation" and benefiting both herdsmen and livestock owners, as well as the policy of ethnic equality and unity, in the pastoral areas of Xinjiang, which has enhanced the enthusiasm of herdsmen in developing production. The number of livestock has increased from more than 12 million before liberation to more than 18.32 million this year. The Kizilsu Kirgiz Autonomous Prefecture had only more than 250,000 head of livestock in 1949, but it has now increased to more than 630,000 head. The Bayingol Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture has also increased from the original 270,000 head of livestock to more than 670,000 head. The livestock in Altay, which was severely damaged by the Ussman bandits, spies of American imperialism, has also more than doubled compared to 1949.

	The livestock of state-owned ranches is also increasing year by year. At present, there are 85 state-owned ranches, breeding farms, and dairy farms in Xinjiang Province. Over the past five years, the livestock in various livestock farms has increased 19-fold, with a total of more than 700,000 head of livestock bred. It plays a great exemplary role in improving Xinjiang livestock breeds and implementing advanced grazing and management. The work of improving the local breed of sheep with "Xinjiang sheep" has also achieved good results. Up to now, about 600,000 local breed sheep have been improved. "Xinjiang sheep" have strong adaptability, high conception rate, and a weight of 50-60 kilograms. Each ewe can produce 3.5 kilograms of wool per year; rams can produce 6 kilograms of wool. The wool can be spun into 60 count yarn, which is three times higher than the wool production of ordinary local sheep.

	Over the past five years, the People's Government has vigorously led herdsmen of all ethnic groups to launch patriotic livestock increase and protection campaigns. Mass livestock increase and protection committees have been generally established at the district, township, and village levels to improve livestock feeding and management and prevent and overcome various natural disasters. Herdsmen in various pastoral areas have also built thousands of canals to irrigate grasslands and improve pasture. They also reasonably regulate the use of pastures in the spirit of mutual assistance and unity. In order to ensure the safe wintering of livestock, the People's Government mobilizes herdsmen to cut and store hundreds of billions of catties of winter grass and build tens of thousands of pens and sheds every year. It also mobilizes herdsmen to fight wolves and eliminate pests. In 1953 alone, there were 873 wolf hunting teams and more than 15,900 herdsmen participated in the wolf hunting and pest elimination campaign throughout the province. Therefore, it has ensured the continuous increase in the number of livestock. The conception rate, reproduction rate, and survival rate of young animals have all exceeded the past reproduction levels.

	The People's Government has also issued huge livestock protection loans to support herdsmen in increasing production. Over the past five years, it has loaned more than 37 billion yuan in livestock protection loans, more than 2,100 hunting rifles, more than 34,000 sickles for cutting and storing winter grass, 110 grass cutting machines, and also issued 11 billion yuan in relief funds. This year, it also established 11 state-owned grass cutting machine stations on the grasslands, which greatly solved the production and living difficulties of poor herdsmen. At present, there are 63 animal husbandry and veterinary stations established in various pastoral areas, which have trained more than 700 veterinary cadres of all ethnic groups, and also united and trained thousands of folk veterinarians, providing free prevention and treatment for millions of livestock for herdsmen, ensuring the health of livestock.

    新疆省今年完成牲畜增殖计划
    【新华社乌鲁木齐十九日电】新疆省的牲畜连年增加，今年又完成了牲畜增殖计划，大小牲畜较一九五三年增加了百分之十五点四。近六十万依靠畜牧业生产为生的哈萨克、柯尔克兹、蒙古、塔吉克等族人民的生活，逐渐富裕起来。
    五年来，中国共产党和人民政府在新疆牧区广泛深入地贯彻执行了“不斗不分、不划阶级”和牧工牧主两利的畜牧业政策以及民族平等团结的政策，提高了牧民发展生产的积极性。牲畜由解放前的一千二百多万头，增殖到今年的一千八百三十二万多头。克兹勒苏柯尔克兹族自治区在一九四九年只有二十五万多头牲畜，现已增加至六十三万多头；巴音郭楞蒙古族自治区也由原有二十七万头牲畜增加到六十七万多头。遭受美国帝国主义间谍乌斯满匪徒严重破坏的阿勒泰专区的牲畜也比一九四九年增加了一倍多。
    国营牧场的牲畜也在逐年增加着。现在新疆省共有国营牧场、种畜场、牛奶场八十五个。五年来各畜牧场的牲畜增加了十九倍，共计繁殖牲畜七十多万头，它对改进新疆牲畜品种、实行先进的放牧和经营管理起着很大的示范作用。以“新疆羊”改良土种绵羊品种的工作，也收到良好成绩，到今年为止已改良了土种绵羊约六十万只。“新疆羊”适应性强，受胎率高，体重五、六十公斤，每只母羊每年可产毛三点五公斤；公羊可产毛六公斤，羊毛可纺六十支纱，比一般土种羊产毛量高达三倍。
    五年来，人民政府大力领导各族牧民展开爱国增畜保畜运动，各地普遍地成立了区、乡、村群众性的增畜保畜委员会，改善了牲畜的饲养管理，并预防和战胜各种自然灾害。各牧区牧民还修建了千百条渠道，灌溉草原，改良牧草。并以互助团结的精神，合理调剂利用牧场。为了保证牲畜安全过冬，人民政府发动牧民，每年都要割储数百亿斤冬草，搭盖数以万计的圈棚。并动员牧民打狼除害，仅在一九五三年全省有八百七十三个打狼小组，一万五千九百多个牧民参加了打狼除害运动。因而保证了牲畜数量的不断增加。母羊受胎、繁殖率和幼畜成活率，都超过了过去的繁殖水平。
    人民政府还发了巨额保畜贷款，扶植牧民增加生产。五年来共贷放了三百七十余亿元的保畜贷款，和二千一百多支猎枪，割储冬草用的镰刀三万四千多把，打草机一百一十架，还发放了一百一十亿元的救济款，今年还在草原上建立了十一处国营打草机站。大大解决了贫苦牧民的生产和生活困难。现在各地牧区成立的畜牧兽医站就有六十三个，共培养了各民族兽医干部七百多人，还团结训练了数千名民间兽医人员，共为牧民免费预防和治疗了数百万头牲畜，保证了牲畜健康。
