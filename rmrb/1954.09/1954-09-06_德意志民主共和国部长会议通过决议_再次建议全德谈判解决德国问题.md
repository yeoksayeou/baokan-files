Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 4th (TASS): The GDR Premier's Press Office issued an announcement:

    On September 3rd, the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic discussed the political situation created after the French National Assembly rejected the "European Defense Community" treaty. Based on the proposal of Foreign Minister Dr. Lothar Bolz, the Council of Ministers passed the following resolution:
      The French National Assembly's rejection of the "European Defense Community" treaty for the sake of France's independence and the future happiness of the French people is a significant step in consolidating the cause of European peace. This decision is a victory for all peace-loving forces who hope to prevent the revival of German militarism and prevent it from becoming the basis for an aggressive military bloc composed of some European countries.
    The rejection of the "European Defense Community" creates new conditions for a comprehensive solution to the problem of ensuring European security and for a peaceful resolution of the German question. Therefore, the government of the German Democratic Republic, all residents of the German Democratic Republic, and the vast majority of residents in West Germany unanimously welcome the rejection of this treaty.
    Adenauer's policy, like that of his predecessor Hitler, is following a dead-end path because it violates the vital interests of both Germany's eastern and western neighbors, thus arousing fierce opposition from both eastern and western neighbors. To resolve the German question and ensure European security, it is necessary to establish sincere and peaceful relations with all of Germany's neighbors.
    If anyone now attempts to revive the revanchist and militaristic West German Wehrmacht in some other form, that attempt will certainly meet with the same firm opposition as the "European Defense Community" treaty. Any form of "European Defense Community," whether it stipulates that West German soldiers form a joint army, allows West Germany to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or adopts other alternative measures, is unacceptable to the German people because it makes the reunification of Germany impossible and threatens European peace. Now, the task of all German patriots is to prevent any attempt to revive German militarism.
    The sovereignty that Adenauer is now demanding for West Germany has nothing in common with genuine sovereignty, which should entitle the people of West Germany—like the residents of the German Democratic Republic—to freely decide, without hindrance, to oppose preparations for a new war, to strive for peace, and to peacefully restore the unity of Germany.
    The government of the German Democratic Republic also demands such sovereignty for West Germany.
    To ensure peace in Europe and achieve the unification of Germany, there is only one practical solution: to establish a European collective security system in which all European countries can participate equally. Germans in East and West Germany must now reach an agreement; a unified, all-German view should be jointly determined to resolve our national problems and help ensure European security.
    The government of the German Democratic Republic has repeatedly proposed holding all-German negotiations, and now it reiterates this proposal and expresses its willingness to support all measures that contribute to reaching an agreement.

### 德意志民主共和国部长会议通过决议  再次建议全德谈判解决德国问题

    德意志民主共和国部长会议通过决议
    再次建议全德谈判解决德国问题
    【新华社讯】塔斯社柏林四日电：德意志民主共和国总理新闻处发表公告：
    九月三日，德意志民主共和国部长会议讨论了在法国国民议会拒绝“欧洲防务集团”条约以后所造成的政治情况。部长会议根据外交部长洛塔·博尔茨博士的建议，通过下列决议：
      法国国民议会为了法国的独立和法国人民的幸福的将来而拒绝了“欧洲防务集团”条约，这一决定是巩固欧洲和平的事业中的一个重大的步骤。这一决定是一切和平力量的胜利，一切和平力量都希望制止复活德国军国主义，使它不能成为一部分欧洲国家组成侵略性军事集团的基础。
    拒绝“欧洲防务集团”条约为全面解决保障欧洲安全问题以及为和平解决德国问题创造了新的条件。因此，德意志民主共和国政府、德意志民主共和国的全体居民以及西德绝大部分的居民普遍一致地欢迎拒绝这一个条约。
    阿登纳的政策和他的前辈希特勒的政策一样，走的是一条毫无出路的绝路，因为这种政策既违背德国人民东方邻国的切身利益，也违背德国人民西方邻国的切身利益，因而它引起了东、西方邻国的激烈反对。为了解决德国问题和保障欧洲安全的问题，就必须同德国的一切邻国建立真诚的、和平的关系。
    如果有人现在企图用某种其他形式来复活西德复仇主义的和军国主义的国防军，那末，这种企图一定会遇到像“欧洲防务集团”条约所遇到的那样坚决的反对。任何形式的“欧洲防务集团”，不管它是规定由西德士兵组成联合军，让西德参加北大西洋公约或采取其他变通办法，都是德国人民所不能接受的，因为它使恢复德国的统一成为不可能，并且威胁着欧洲的和平。现在，全体德国爱国者的任务就是要制止任何复活德国军国主义的企图。
    阿登纳现在为西德所要求的主权和真正的主权毫无共同之处，真正的主权应该使西德人民有权——像德意志民主共和国的居民那样无阻碍地——自由地决定反对准备新的战争，争取和平，争取和平恢复德国的统一。
    德意志民主共和国政府也为西德要求有这样的一种主权。
    为了保障欧洲的和平并实现德国的统一，只有一个切实可行的办法：建立所有欧洲国家都可以平等参加的欧洲集体安全体系。东德和西德的德国人现在必须取得协议；应当共同确定一致的、全德国的观点，以便解决我们的全国性的问题，并有助于保障欧洲的安全。
    德意志民主共和国政府已经多次建议举行全德谈判，现在它重申这个主张，并表示愿意支持一切有助于达成协议的措施。
