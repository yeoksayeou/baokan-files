Beside the Fuchun River

The Fuchun River is in the upper reaches of the Qiantang River—from Fuyang to Tonglu to Qililong. Although this section is only over 120 li long, the river flows in bends, and the mountains on both banks stretch endlessly, making the scenery exceptionally beautiful. The Fuchun River area is rich in fish, tea, silk, bamboo, timber, tung oil..., and the products are very abundant.

The picture on the right is a famous tourist attraction on the banks of the Fuchun River - Yan Ziling's Fishing Terrace.

The mountainous area in the upper reaches of the Fuchun River is rich in timber. Every day, large amounts of rafts flow down the river, transporting materials to various places to support basic construction.

Members of the Fuchun Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fuyang County are preparing high-quality grain after a bumper harvest for paying public grain and selling surplus grain.

Many "hydrological stations" have been established on both sides of the Fuchun River. This is the staff of the "hydrological station" measuring the changes in the water situation.

How lovely is our motherland! Young Pioneers gaze into the distance at the scenery on the river.

The Fuchun River basin is rich in fruits. The famous Tonglu white pears are ripe.

The Fuchun River is rich in fish. These fishermen's helpers, the cormorants, will rest for a while before setting off with their masters to catch fish.
