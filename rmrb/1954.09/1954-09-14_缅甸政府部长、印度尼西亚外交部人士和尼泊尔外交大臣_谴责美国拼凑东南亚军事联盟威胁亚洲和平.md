Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 12th: U Ba Swe, the Burmese Minister of Relief, Resettlement, and Social Welfare, who is leading the Burmese delegation on a visit to India, told reporters in Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, India, that the Burmese government adheres to the Five Principles in the joint declarations of the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers and the Chinese and Burmese Prime Ministers.

	U Ba Swe criticized the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, saying that it threatens peace in Asia and that the time has come for Asian countries to make proposals negating the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, September 12th: According to "Social Messenger," Indonesian Foreign Ministry officials said that the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" would not help ease world tensions, especially in Asia. These people pointed out that most of those participating in the drafting of this treaty are not Asian countries.

	These people said that Indonesia has made it clear that it opposes any treaty of this kind manipulated by non-Asian countries. They also said that all the provisions of this treaty violate the United Nations Charter.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 12th: The Indian Press Trust reported from Kathmandu on the 10th that Nepalese Foreign Minister Regmi said on the 10th that the Southeast Asia Treaty signed at the Manila Conference is another effort to drive Southeast Asian countries toward war. He pointed out that the conclusion of this treaty did not receive the consent of most countries in the region.

	Regmi said: "Today, the world needs international peace and cooperation more than anything else, regardless of the political ideologies, social and economic systems of various countries. We cannot repeat the mistakes and follies that caused the past two world wars. Any method to ensure peace should be welcomed by everyone. But the Manila Pact not only fails to promote international peace and cooperation but also creates division."

    缅甸政府部长、印度尼西亚外交部人士和尼泊尔外交大臣
    谴责美国拼凑东南亚军事联盟威胁亚洲和平
    【新华社新德里十二日电】率领缅甸代表团在印度进行访问的缅甸政府救济、安置和社会福利部部长吴巴素在印度北方省省会勒克瑙对报界说，缅甸政府坚守中印总理、中缅总理联合声明中的五项原则。
    吴巴素抨击东南亚公约组织说，东南亚公约威胁了亚洲和平，亚洲国家作出否定东南亚公约组织的建议的时候已经到来。
    【新华社雅加达十二日电】据“社会使者报”报道，印度尼西亚外交部人士说，“东南亚集体防务条约”不会有助于缓和世界紧张局势，特别是亚洲的紧张局势。这些人士指出，参加拟订这个条约的，大多数都不是亚洲国家。
    这些人士说，印度尼西亚早已明白表示反对任何像这种由那些非亚洲国家所操纵的条约。他们又说，这个条约的所有条款都是违反联合国宪章的。
    【新华社新德里十二日电】印度报业托辣斯十日自加德满都报道，尼泊尔外交大臣雷格米十日说，马尼拉会议签订的东南亚条约是驱使东南亚国家走向战争的另一个努力。他指出，这个条约的缔结并没有得到这一地区大多数国家的同意。
    雷格米说：“今天世界需要国际和平及合作甚于其他一切，不管各个国家的政治思想、社会和经济制度如何。我们不能重复那些引起过去两次大战的错误和愚昧了。任何为了保证和平的方法都应受到大家的欢迎。但是马尼拉协定不但不能促进国际和平与合作，反而制造分裂。”
