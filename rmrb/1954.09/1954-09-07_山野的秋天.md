When the vast mountains and fields of Sichuan Province entered the autumn harvest season, we came to the Suining Special District, which we had visited in the spring. Although this area experienced a drought unprecedented in the past decade this year, it still achieved a fruitful harvest. Everywhere, the threshing grounds in front of farmers' houses were covered with golden grains, the white catkins in the cotton fields were like stars, and the green vines densely covered the sweet potato fields.

We stayed in the office of the Suining Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party for more than an hour. The cadres managing the materials answered the phone and opened letters for a while, and various places were reporting good news of the harvest to the office. Ping'an Township in Shehong County, the area with the longest drought time in the entire special district, reported that the township's rice production increased by 7%. The Hongqi Agricultural Production Cooperative, the largest cooperative in Suining Special District, reported that it harvested more than 90,000 catties of grain from more than 160 mu of rice paddies. According to materials from various places, the entire special district's rice production is estimated to increase by about 6% compared to last year.

We then went to Ping'an Township, Shehong County. In the spring, we reported to our readers that this township, with the strength of an agricultural production cooperative and seventy-eight mutual aid groups, dredged a "Chuanshan Dyke" that had been silted up for more than a hundred years last winter and this spring, greatly improving irrigation conditions. Now, when we arrived, the township's rice had been harvested, and every household was full of grain and had stacks of straw. In the large cotton fields, the cotton bolls were constantly spitting out catkins, and people were busy picking cotton. In better cotton fields, it is estimated that more than 50 catties of ginned cotton can be harvested per mu. We visited the Jianshe Agricultural Production Cooperative. This year, the members of the cooperative continuously wheeled water from the "Chuanshan Dyke" day and night for a month and a half, resisting the drought situation where it did not rain thoroughly for two months, and finally achieved a bumper harvest. After a trial calculation, the cooperative's income increased by 98% compared to last year, including the increased production from wasteland reclamation and expanded cultivated land area. All thirty-six households of cooperative members increased their income.

The other 130 large dikes and 700 "socialist large ponds" built by various counties in Suining Special District last winter and this spring played a similar role to the "Chuanshan Dyke" in this year's drought resistance. Therefore, the farmers said that the main reason for this year's bumper harvest was: larger and more widespread water conservancy construction was carried out on the basis of mutual assistance and cooperation.

Now, more than 80% of the farmers in Suining Special District have been organized, and the number of agricultural production cooperatives has increased more than twenty times compared to the spring, and basically every township has a cooperative. Before the autumn harvest is completely over, we have seen many mutual aid and cooperation organizations invest in larger-scale water conservancy construction than in the spring. A "Shanwan Large Pond," similar to a small reservoir, is being built everywhere. We visited one built by the second village of Ximei Township, Suining County. It is built in a high mountain depression, like a small lake, intercepting the mountain floods and discharging them down the mountain in a planned way to irrigate more than 300 mu of rice paddies. On the morning of the day we visited, this village held a meeting of more than 30 Communist Party members, Youth League members, and activists. The meeting decided to build four more "Shanwan Large Ponds" this autumn and next spring. After completion, the village's water conservancy problems can be completely solved. When we left Suining Special District, eight such "Shanwan Large Ponds" had been built in the entire special district, the largest of which could store 110,000 cubic meters of water. The Suining Prefectural Commissioner's Office plans to lead farmers to build more than 2,200 "Shanwan Large Ponds" from this autumn to next spring, irrigating more than 400,000 mu of paddy fields and increasing the country's production of more grain and cotton.

    山野的秋天
    新华社记者　程在华　范眭
    当四川省广阔的山野进入秋收季节时，我们来到了春天曾经访问过的遂宁专区。今年这里虽然遇到过十年来罕有的旱象，但是仍争得了丰硕的收成。到处可见农家门前的晒场上铺满了金黄的谷粒，棉田里朵朵雪白的花絮像繁星一样，甘薯地里绿色的藤叶密密地覆盖着。
    我们在中共遂宁地方委员会的办公室里停留了一个多钟头。管理材料的干部一会儿接电话，一会儿拆信件，各地都在向办公室报告丰收喜讯。全专区受旱时间最久的射洪县平安乡，报告全乡水稻增产百分之七。红旗农业生产合作社是遂宁专区最大的一个社，报告全社一百六十多亩稻田共收了九万多斤谷。根据各地材料推算，整个专区水稻可比去年增产百分之六左右。
    我们随即去射洪县平安乡。春天，我们曾向读者报道过：这个乡在去冬今春以一个农业生产合作社及七十八个互助组的力量，打通一座淤塞百多年的“穿山大堰”，使灌溉条件大大改观。现在我们到达时，全乡水稻已收割完毕，家家谷满仓、草成塔。大片棉田里，棉桃不断吐出花絮，人们正忙着采摘棉花。较好一点的棉田，估计每亩可收皮棉五十多斤。我们访问了建设农业生产合作社。社员们今年从“穿山大堰”里昼夜不停地车了一个半月的水，抗击了两个月不下透雨的干旱局面，最后得到丰收。经过试算，全社连开荒扩大耕地面积增产部分在内，比去年增加收入百分之九十八。全社三十六户社员，户户都增加收益。
    遂宁专区各县去冬今春修筑的其他一百三十多座大堰和七百口“社会主义大塘”，在今年抗旱中所起的作用，也和“穿山大堰”相似。因此，农民们把今年丰收的主要原因说成是：在互助合作的基础上进行了较大的和较普遍的水利建设。
    现在遂宁专区组织起来的农户已达到百分之八十以上，农业生产合作社比春天增加了二十多倍，基本上乡乡有社了。秋收还未完全结束，我们已看见很多互助合作组织投入了比春天更大规模的水利建设。一种类似小型水库的“山弯大塘”，正在各地兴建。我们参观了遂宁县西眉乡第二村兴修的一口。它修筑在高山坳，像一个小湖泊，拦蓄山上的洪水，并把它有计划地放下山去，灌溉三百多亩稻田。在我们访问的当天上午，这个村开了一个三十多人的共产党员、青年团员和积极分子大会。会上决定今秋明春再修四口“山弯大塘”，完工后，全村的水利问题就可全部解决。当我们离开遂宁专区时，像这样的“山弯大塘”，全专区已修好八口，最大的一口可蓄水十一万立方公尺。遂宁专署计划从今秋到明春领导农民修筑“山弯大塘”二千二百多口，灌溉四十多万亩水田，为国家增产更多的粮食和棉花。
