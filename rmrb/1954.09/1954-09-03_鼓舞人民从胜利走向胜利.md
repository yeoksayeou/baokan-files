    Inspire the People to Advance from Victory to Victory
    Before and during the first session of the First Beijing Municipal People's Congress, the Beijing Daily organized seven special pages and two pictorial supplements to publicize the tremendous achievements of Beijing's construction in various fields over the past five years since liberation.
    Beijing is the capital of our great motherland. The newspaper first published a special page reflecting the construction of Beijing's democratic government over the past five years. The special page published articles such as "Review of the Construction of the Capital's Democratic Government over the Past Five Years," "The People's Congress System is the Fundamental System of Our Country," "A Government Committee Member from a Worker Background," "A Farm Laborer Becomes Deputy District Head," and some pictures. This special page showed readers the growth process of Beijing's people's power: as early as August 1949, before the birth of the People's Republic of China, Beijing (then called Beiping), under the close care of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, convened the first People's Representative Conference of All Circles. The Second First People's Representative Conference of All Circles, held three months later, was approved by the Central People's Government and began to perform the functions of the Municipal People's Congress. Over the past five years, the democratic essence of the Municipal People's Representative Conference of All Circles has been continuously promoted, the democratic form has been increasingly perfected, and it has gradually transitioned to today's People's Congress with universal suffrage. The special page used facts to prove that the People's Congress system is most convenient for the broad masses of the people to concentrate and realize their will and exercise their power, and is a powerful guarantee for promoting various constructions.
    Beijing's urban construction is what people care about. The newspaper focused on reflecting the face of Beijing's urban construction over the past five years in a special page and a pictorial supplement. Wang Mingzhi, chief engineer of the Beijing Municipal Construction Committee and vice chairman of the China Civil Engineering Society, wrote an article in the special page: "The Joy of Builders." The author taught at Tsinghua University from 1930 and participated in Beijing's construction work after liberation. He compared his personal experiences before and after liberation and summarized the amazing development of Beijing's urban construction over the past five years. The author wrote that before liberation, Beijing had not built any decent buildings since 1936, but the area of newly built houses since liberation has exceeded one-third of the total area of old houses. Before liberation, from 1945 to the end of 1948, the Kuomintang reactionary government built only one kilometer of new sewers, and almost all of the old sewers were damaged and silted up. Only more than 20 kilometers of the 280 kilometers of sewers could drain water; after liberation, not only were these damaged and silted old sewers repaired and dredged, but also more than 200 kilometers of new sewers were built. Before liberation, only five buses and forty-nine trams were operating; now the number of buses has increased to 293 and the number of trams has increased to 221. … This person, who had taught civil engineering for more than 20 years in old China and often doubted how much his work could do, said in the article with great emotion: "Looking back at the tremendous achievements of Beijing's urban construction over the past five years, our joy and excitement are beyond words." Other articles published in the special page and more than ten photos in the pictorial supplement described many aspects of Beijing's urban construction from various different angles, concretely and vividly. All these articles and pictures show that our capital is following the principle of "serving production, serving the working people, and serving the central organs," and is being built along the road of socialist urban construction, and will continue to be built into a more beautiful and magnificent new type of city.
    The newspaper also published special pages on Beijing's industrial construction, agricultural production in the suburbs, socialist commerce, handicraft industry, and cultural, educational, and health undertakings. In these special pages, people not only saw the overview of the development and changes in the above aspects over the past five years, but also saw the victory of the Party and the People's Government's various policies, the development of production and construction, the improvement of people's lives, and the rapid progress of the motherland through many typical facts, concretely and subtly.
    Five years, in the long history of the ancient city of Beijing, is only a short period of time. But through these special pages, people can feel how huge and profound changes can be produced even in a short five years after the people become masters. Undoubtedly, such changes are not only in Beijing, but also in all parts of the country. When welcoming the great festival of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, if local newspapers can systematically and fully, and realistically, reflect the achievements of various constructions in their localities according to their local characteristics, it will be a powerful encouragement to the people—encouraging people to advance from victory to greater victory with full confidence, and encouraging people to resolutely overcome any difficulties on the road ahead.

专栏：报纸巡礼

    鼓舞人民从胜利走向胜利
    北京日报在北京市第一届人民代表大会第一次会议前及会议期间，组织了七个专页和两期画刊，来宣传解放后五年多来北京市各方面建设的巨大成就。
    北京是我们伟大祖国的首都。报纸首先刊出了反映五年多来首都民主政权建设的专页。专页中发表了“五年多来首都民主政权建设的回顾”、
  “人民代表大会制度是我们国家的根本制度”、
  “工人出身的政府委员”、“雇农当了副区长”等文章和一些图片。这个专页向读者显示了北京人民政权的成长过程：还是一九四九年八月，在中华人民共和国尚未诞生之前，北京（当时叫北平）就在中国人民伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀下，召开了第一届各界人民代表会议。三个月后举行的第二届第一次各界人民代表会议，就获得中央人民政府批准，开始执行了市人民代表大会的职权。五年多来，市各界人民代表会议的民主实质不断发扬，民主形式日益完备，逐步过渡到今天的普选的人民代表大会。专页用事实证明了人民代表大会制度最便于广大人民集中和实现其意志以及行使其权力，是推动各项建设的有力保证。
    北京的城市建设是人们所关心的。报纸在一个专页和一期画刊中，集中地反映了五年多来北京城市建设的面貌。北京市政建设委员会总工程师、中国土木工程学会副理事长王明之在专页中写了一篇文章：“建设者的喜悦”。作者从一九三○年起就在清华大学教书，解放后参加了北京的建设工作，他以解放前后的亲身经历进行对比，概括地叙述了五年多来北京城市建设的惊人发展。作者写道，解放前从一九三六年以后，北京始终没有盖过像样一点的建筑物，但是解放以来新建的房屋面积已超过了旧有房屋总面积的三分之一。解放前从一九四五年到一九四八年底，国民党反动政府新建的下水道只有一公里，旧有的下水道也几乎全部损坏、淤塞，在二百八十多公里的下水道中只有二十多公里能排水；解放后不仅这些损坏、淤塞的旧水道得到了整修和淘挖，而且新建了下水道达二百多公里。解放前，公共汽车开动的只有五辆，电车只有四十九辆；而现在公共汽车增加到二百九十三辆，电车增加到二百二十一辆。……这位曾在旧中国教了二十多年土木工程学、时常怀疑自己的工作究竟能有多大作用的人，在文中不胜感慨地说：“回顾起北京五年多来城市建设的巨大成就，我们的喜悦和兴奋是难以言表的。”专页中发表的其他文章以及画刊中的十多幅照片，则从各个不同的角度，具体而生动地描绘了北京城市建设的许多侧面。而所有这些文章和图片都表明我们的首都是遵循着
  “为生产、为劳动人民、为中央机关服务”的方针，沿着社会主义城市建设的道路进行建设的，并将继续建设成为更美丽更辉煌的新型城市。
    报纸也刊出了关于北京工业建设、郊区农业生产、社会主义商业、手工业和文教卫生事业的专页。在这些专页中，人们不仅看到上述各个方面五年多来发展和变化的概貌，而且通过许多典型的事实，具体而微地看到了党和人民政府的各项政策的胜利，看到了生产建设的发展，看到了人民生活的改善，看到了祖国一日千里的进步。
    五年，这在古城北京的悠长历史上，不过是短短的一小段。但是通过这些专页，人们却能感到，在人民成为主人以后，即使是短短的五年，也能产生多么巨大而深刻的变化。无疑地，不仅在北京，而且在全国各地都充满着这样的变化。在迎接中华人民共和国成立五周年的伟大节日时，如果各地报纸都能根据当地的特点，把当地各项建设的成就系统而充分地，并且是实事求是地反映出来，那对于人民群众将是一种有力的鼓舞——鼓舞人们信心百倍地从胜利走向更大的胜利，鼓舞人们坚决战胜前进道路上的任何困难。（施新）
