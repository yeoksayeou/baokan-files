Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 6th: According to Hong Kong newspapers, Mr. Attlee of the British Labour Party delegation, who was recently invited to visit China, held a press conference in Hong Kong on the 2nd to express his impressions of this visit to China.

In his statement, Attlee first said: "First, let me state that one cannot make a final judgment after only a short visit to a country that one did not understand before."

Attlee said that the purpose of his delegation's visit was "to try to gain some understanding and knowledge, and to have some contact with people."

Attlee said that his general view was that it is always useful to try to understand others, and that one of the unresolved problems in the current world is the relationship between peoples of countries ruled according to different principles.

Attlee emphasized the difference between the British Labour Party and the Chinese people in their views on social systems. He said: "We have found, and we anticipated finding, that the Communists are governing China according to principles that we do not agree with. We are democratic socialists, we have clearly stated our views, and we have also tried to understand the views of those who are governing the Chinese government."

Attlee believes that the Chinese people are friendly to Western countries, and he advocates that Western countries maintain contact with the Chinese people. In his view, that can correct the "misunderstandings" of the West. Attlee said: "I think that wherever we go, there is a general expression of goodwill, and I believe that it is very important for us to maintain close contact with the Chinese people as much as possible. I am sure that it is also very important for them to maintain close contact with the West as much as possible, because people find that what the West does is subject to all kinds of misunderstandings, and it is best to correct these misunderstandings."

Attlee then expressed some conclusions reached by his delegation:

Attlee said: "First of all, we are deeply impressed by some very positive reforms. From all the information we can understand, these reforms show that China has embarked on a new path. What we see everywhere shows that there is a government that will not be corrupt, and this government truly acts in accordance with the principles of its own beliefs, and has completed some very outstanding work, for example, so much work is being done in public health." Attlee said that the effect of the fly-eradication campaign impressed him deeply. He felt that it was a fresh thing to go to the market without finding flies, without smelling odors, and seeing everything clean.

The second thing that Attlee believes impressed his delegation was: "This government is carrying out large-scale work, and does not think that everything is already very good now. ... Our Chinese friends frankly told us that they still have a long way to go to catch up, although they have completed some work, there is still much work to be done."

Attlee said: The evidence of work is "very significant," such as the achievements in building housing in Beijing, Shenyang, and other places in China. They also saw evidence of very hard work in education.

Attlee said: "I also believe that the Chinese peasants have obtained such a government: it is doing things for them and is concerned about the prosperity of the peasants."

Attlee added that they could not see much. They visited some rural areas. But the evidence they obtained seemed to show that the Chinese government is based on the goodwill of the peasants.

Referring to Shanghai, Attlee said: He saw evidence of hard work there. People there told them that there had been many malpractices and evils there for a long time, and now the city has cleared these malpractices and evils at once. This is due to the efficiency of the government.

On the understanding of democracy and freedom, Attlee revealed that his own views were different from those of the Chinese people. He said with reservations: Regarding individual freedom and freedom of thought and speech—these are some of the specific issues he is concerned about—people cannot judge the work being done there very well. He also said that they did not expect to find something very different from the entire structure of all Communist-ruled countries. He specifically cited the trade union movement as an example to illustrate that the trade union movements in Britain and China are different.

Referring to China's religious policy, Attlee said that he had met with Chinese religious representatives and attended services in churches. He said: "The general impression is that the resentment against foreign missions and churches is less communist and more nationalistic. It can be said that this is opposition to foreign and external forces. But it is also difficult to make a final judgment on this point."

In summarizing his visit to China, Attlee said: "We were very well taken care of and treated everywhere. We have established some friendships, and we cherish these friendships very much."

Attlee expressed his views on the relationship between China and the West, saying: "The general impression is that there is a friendly desire, but undoubtedly, there is a very strong sentiment about Taiwan. Especially, as I have said publicly elsewhere, this is one of the fundamental issues that must be resolved."

### 艾德礼在香港发表访问中国观感

    艾德礼在香港发表访问中国观感
    【新华社广州六日电】据香港报纸报道：最近应邀到我国访问的英国工党代表团艾德礼先生二日在香港举行记者招待会，发表这次访问中国的观感。
    艾德礼在发表谈话时首先说：“首先声明一点，一个人在对自己先前没有了解的国家仅仅作了短时间的访问以后，是不会下最后判断的。”
    艾德礼说：他的代表团进行访问的目的是“设法得到一定的了解和知识，对人物有一定的接触。”
    艾德礼说，他的一般看法是：设法了解别人总是有用的，当前世界上的没有解决的问题之一是按照不同原则被统治的各国人民之间的关系。
    艾德礼着重指出英国工党和中国人民在对社会制度看法上的差别。他说：“我们发现而且我们先前预料会发现共产党人是按照我们并不同意的原则治理着中国的。我们是民主的社会主义者，我们已经肯定说明我们的观点，我们也曾竭力设法了解在治理着中国政府的那些人的观点。”
    艾德礼认为中国人民对西方国家是友好的，他主张西方国家与中国人民保持接触。据他看来，那样可以纠正对西方的“误解”。艾德礼说：“我认为，不论我们走到什么地方去，都有一种普遍的善意的表示，我相信，我们尽可能和中国人民保持密切接触，是很重要的一件事。我确信，他们尽可能和西方保持密切接触，也是一件很重要的事，因为人们发觉，西方所做的事受到了各种各样的误解，纠正这些误解，是最好不过的。”
    艾德礼接着表示了他的代表团得出的一些结论：
    艾德礼说：“首先，给我们深刻印象的是一些非常肯定的改革。从我们所能了解到的全部情况看来，这些改革表明中国已走上一条新的道路。我们在每一个地方看到的事情表明，那里有一个不会腐化的政府，这个政府真正依据自己信仰的原则办事，并且已经完成了一些非常出色的工作，举例说，在公共卫生方面正在进行的那么许多工作。”艾德礼说，灭蝇运动的效果给他深刻的印象，他觉得，到市场上去而没有发现苍蝇，没有闻到臭味，看到一切东西都是干干净净的，是一件新鲜的事情。
    艾德礼认为给他的代表团深刻印象的第二件事是：“这个政府正在进行规模宏大的工作，而并不自以为现在一切都已经很好了。……我们的中国朋友们坦率地告诉我们说，他们还要走很长一段路才能赶上，虽然他们已经完成了一些工作，可是要做的工作还很多。”
    艾德礼说：工作的证据是“很显著”的，例如在北京、沈阳和中国其他地方建筑住房方面的成就。他们还看到在教育方面非常努力的证据。
    艾德礼说：“我还相信，中国农民已得到了这样一个政府：它正在替他们做事，并且是关心农民的富裕的。”
    艾德礼又说，他们不可能看得很多。他们访问了一些农村。但是他们获得的证据似乎显示中国政府是建立在农民的好感的基础上的。
    艾德礼在谈到上海时说：他在那里看到了努力的证据，据那里的人告诉他们，那里长期来存在着许多恶习和罪恶，现在这个城市一下子已清除了这些恶习和罪恶。这要归功于政府的效率。
    在对民主和自由的了解上，艾德礼表露出他自己的看法是和中国人民不同的。他以有保留的态度说：关于个人自由与思想和言论自由——这是他关心的具体问题中的几个问题——人们不能很好地判断那里正在做的工作。他又说，他们并不指望发现和所有共产党统治的各国整个结构非常不同的东西。他特别举出工会运动作为例子，说明英国和中国的工会运动是不同的。
    在谈到中国的宗教政策时，艾德礼说他曾会见过中国的宗教代表并在教堂里做过礼拜。他说：“一般的印象是：对外国布道会和教堂所表示的反感与其说带有共产主义色彩，不如说带有民族主义色彩。可以说，这是反对外国和外界的势力。但是在这一点上也很难下最后的判断。”
    艾德礼在总结他对中国的访问时说：“我们到处受到非常和善的照顾和款待。我们建立了一些友谊，我们是很珍视这种友谊的。”
    艾德礼就他对中国和西方的关系的观感发表意见说：“一般的印象是有着一种友好的愿望，但是无疑地，对台湾有一种非常强烈的情绪。特别是正如我曾在别的地方公开说过的，这是必须予以解决的基本问题之一。”
