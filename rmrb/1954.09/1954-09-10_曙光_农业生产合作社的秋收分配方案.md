    "Dawn" Agricultural Production Cooperative's Autumn Harvest Distribution Plan
    Shi Kejian
    The "Dawn" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhangqing Village, Yuci County, Shanxi Province, was established last year. Last year, everyone lacked experience and simply thought, "As long as we harvest a lot of grain, distribution will be easy." As a result, the autumn harvest distribution was rushed and chaotic, and not very fair. Now, everyone is still worried about the distribution issue. Cooperative committee member Xu Erhuo said, "Last year there were only thirty households, but this year there are one hundred and eighty-seven. If we don't plan the distribution in advance like we did last year, even if we harvest a lot of grain, the agricultural cooperative will collapse." The members are even more worried: the crops are growing very well this year, but they are afraid that the distribution will not be good.
    Therefore, as early as the beginning of August, the cooperative committee members conducted a "yield estimation" budget, and then announced the method and results of the "yield estimation" budget to the entire cooperative, and launched a wide-ranging discussion among the members. After discussion, the members approved the "yield estimation" budget and put forward many opinions on the distribution method. Based on the opinions of all the members, and in accordance with the instructions of the higher authorities, and drawing on the experience and lessons learned from the autumn and summer distributions, a detailed autumn harvest distribution plan was formulated in mid-August:
    "According to the estimated yield calculation: the total income from agriculture is 1,065,756 jin of grain, equivalent to 692,741,400 yuan (calculated at 650 yuan per jin); the total income from sideline occupations is 101.65 million yuan. The total income from the above two items is 794,391,400 yuan. The total expenditure for the year is 191.858 million yuan. The total number of labor days for the entire cooperative is 31,000. The total land yield assessment is 5,162 shi, 5 dou, and 6. The distribution methods are as follows:
    I. The distribution will be carried out in accordance with the following two principles: 1. Distribution based primarily on labor dividends, taking into account reasonable land remuneration; 2. Support national construction while taking care of the needs of cooperative members.
    II. The cooperative's labor and land income will be based on a proportional dividend system, and livestock will be rented. It is determined that the total investment in production for the year (including livestock rental fees, fertilizers, feed, seeds, etc.) will be deducted from the total income, and then 5% of the reserve fund and public welfare fund will be deducted from the net income, and the remainder will be distributed to the members, 60% based on labor and 40% based on land. According to this calculation, the reserve fund and public welfare fund to be deducted should be 30,126,670 yuan; each labor day should receive a dividend of 11,078 yuan, and each shi of land yield should receive a dividend of 44,350 yuan.
    III. Regarding the sale of surplus grain and payment of public grain. Last autumn, each household sold and paid their own grain; this summer, the surplus grain was collectively sold and the public grain was paid uniformly, and accounts were settled separately after the sale and payment. Based on these two experiences, after research, everyone agreed to adopt the method used this summer. The specific method is divided into two steps: 1. First, according to the general local living standard, the standard number of food grain per person per year is uniformly determined through democratic means (this number should guarantee enough to eat), and then the total amount of food grain for each household for the year is calculated according to this standard and distributed to each household member. Then, the remaining grain, after deducting the necessary investment for next year (seeds, feed) and the total amount of public grain to be paid by all households in the cooperative, will be sold to the state in its entirety. 2. Subtract the total of food grain, investment, and public grain from the total amount of grain that each household member should receive, and the remaining amount is the amount of grain to be sold; households with large surpluses sell more and receive more money, and households with small surpluses sell less and receive less money. This method has the following advantages: (1) The surplus grain and public grain are sold and paid quickly and early, and the procedures are simple and reduce work delays, and the grain is less likely to be damaged, which can avoid the trouble and confusion of long returns and short supplements during distribution; (2) It is easier to demonstrate the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives and can establish a sense of honor among the members for producing more and selling more grain; (3) It can both guarantee the food grain needs of the members and solve the investment problems within the cooperative.
    IV. The distribution time is still decided to be the same as last year, with distribution following each harvest. Since the quantity and quality of land cultivated by the six production teams in the cooperative are completely the same this year, and the types and growth of crops are also generally the same, the method of distributing large crops by team is generally adopted from harvesting to threshing to distribution. Also, because the grain that the members receive this year is all their own food grain, each household must calculate how much they need based on the number of people in their family and the standard, and how much of each type of grain they need, and the cooperative will consider unified planning and adjustment based on the information reported by each household. For example, sorghum, corn, and millet are the main food grains for the members, but because they are planted in large quantities, there is no fear of not being able to distribute them; only cotton, soybeans, mung beans, sweet potatoes, and yams are also much needed by all households in the cooperative, but not much was planted this year, so this will be solved in two ways: (1) Distribution will be based on the proportion of labor and land, with reference to the number of people in the members' families; (2) Focus on distribution to the few members who need them most. At the same time, it is very important to distribute grain of good and bad quality evenly during the above distribution. Based on the distribution experience of last year and this summer, the following methods need to be adopted: 1. Mix good and bad crops together when threshing. 2. Mix the grain from the upwind and downwind sides evenly after winnowing and then distribute it; 3. Set aside some particularly good and particularly bad grain for seeds, feed investment, or public reserve funds.
    V. The calculation standard for distribution is 650 yuan per jin of millet, and other varieties will be converted according to this standard.
    VI. Everyone is willing to deduct the investment in seeds and feed for next year uniformly according to the proportion of each household's labor and land, record it under the name of each household member, and use it as their investment in the cooperative, which will be returned after the autumn harvest next year. The advantages of doing this are: (1) Unified selection and storage of seeds can ensure the quality of the seeds; (2) It is fair, reasonable, simple, and convenient; (3) It does not affect the actual income and economic life of the members. In order to take care of all the cooperative members so that every household has surplus grain to sell, the investment in feed should be deducted according to the specific situation, and some households can be deducted less or not deducted at all (it is estimated that three or two households need to be taken care of).
    VII. Straw distribution method: Last year, everyone ignored the distribution of straw, resulting in improper distribution and causing chaos, and the members had many opinions. This year, it was decided to take the following measures to distribute it: (1) Since livestock are raised collectively within the cooperative, the grain straw, bean stalks, and pod husks, in addition to returning the members' feed investment from last year, the rest will be uniformly retained by the cooperative as a collective investment in feed for the entire cooperative; (2) The livestock here do not eat corn stalks, and it is also difficult to burn them as firewood, so they will all be retained by the cooperative to be composted as fertilizer, as a collective investment for the entire cooperative; (3) Because fuel is relatively scarce locally, all the sorghum stalks will be distributed to the members for their own use according to the number of people in each household and the amount they need.
    VIII. Solutions to several specific problems: (1) Only part of the labor days used in basic construction this year will be counted, and the rest will be settled gradually in the following years. (2) Sideline income and agricultural labor income will be unified, and dividends will be calculated based on the average number of agricultural and sideline labor days. (3) Because the wheat fields this year are not managed uniformly by the entire cooperative, a unified dividend and settlement method will not be adopted for the two seasons.
    IX. In order to make the procedures simple and orderly, and based on the characteristics of distribution by production team, it is stipulated that the cooperative will uniformly issue triplicate receipts. During distribution, the cooperative's accountant will debit the account according to the slip, the captain will distribute the grain according to the slip, and the members will receive the grain with the slip; after each distribution, the captain will hand over the remaining grain to the storekeeper, and the storekeeper will issue a slip to the team, which will be transferred to the cooperative for debiting the account.
    X. Because the team's distribution responsibility is significant, it is determined that the cooperative committee members will go to the teams to assist specifically, and the president and vice-president will be responsible for overall control. Because the quantity of grain stored uniformly is large, the preparation and selection of warehouses and custodians must be done well, and there must be a dedicated person responsible for carrying it out from beginning to end. After the distribution work is completed, the cooperative will announce the distribution results to all members.
    After the distribution plan was determined, the members had a clear understanding of the entire cooperative's and their own "family wealth" for this year. According to the calculation based on the standards of the distribution plan: Old cooperative member Han Chouhui, who has a lot of labor and little land (seven family members, five laborers, and more than fifteen mu of land), estimates that he can receive 10,850 jin of grain this year, which is 1,850 jin more than he received last year. New cooperative member Liu Youli, who has a lot of land and little labor (four family members, only one and a half laborers, and more than seventeen mu and six fen of land), estimates that he can also receive 5,438 jin of grain, which is 938 jin more than he received when he worked individually last year. Only new cooperative member Liu Yueqing estimates that he will receive 200 jin less grain than last year (10,500 jin last year, 10,300 jin this year); however, he had to hire short-term workers for two months and ten days last year, which required more than 1,078 jin of work grain; so, his actual income is still higher than last year. After such calculations, the members' thinking was further consolidated, and even the more than ten households of Zhou Jiaying, Yao Yongchang, etc., who had wavered, are now at ease, and their enthusiasm for labor has also increased.
    In the process of democratically formulating the distribution plan, the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives was once again demonstrated. According to the "yield estimation" budget, the autumn fields of the entire cooperative yielded 93 jin of grain per mu more than last year. Why could production be increased? The members all clearly understood that it was directly related to the support and assistance of the state. Therefore, in order to support national construction so that the state can better help farmers produce, everyone decided that, in addition to retaining food grain, public grain, and investment, the remaining grain would be sold to the state collectively in its entirety. According to preliminary estimates, 345,296 jin of grain can be sold to the state this autumn. The poorest household in the cooperative expects to have 260 jin of surplus grain to sell. After the large increase in production this year, the cooperative has reached the level of "every household has enough grain to eat, and every family sells surplus grain."
    Now, this cooperative is actively carrying out preparations for the autumn harvest distribution in accordance with the distribution plan, combined with production: (1) Organizing the grain distribution organization and selecting custodians; (2) Preparing warehouses; (3) Investigating and registering the grain seed needs of each member; (4) Repairing and purchasing tools used for harvesting, threshing, and distribution; printing forms and receipts needed for distribution, etc. This year's autumn harvest distribution work will no longer be as chaotic as last year.

    “曙光”农业生产合作社的秋收分配方案
    史可鉴
    山西省榆次县张庆村“曙光”农业生产合作社是去年建立的。去年大家没经验，只觉得“粮食只要打得多，分配好办”，所以秋收分配时事先没有准备，结果分得忙忙乱乱，不太合理。现在，大家还为分配问题担着心。社务委员许二货说：“去年才三十户，今年成了一百八十七户，如果咱们还像去年那样预先不计划个分配底底，就是粮食收得再多，分配不好，农业社也得垮台。”社员们更是担心着：今年庄稼长得很好，就怕分配不好。
    因此，还是在八月初旬的时候，社务委员们就进行了“估产”预算，然后把“估产”预算的方法和结果向全社公布了，并且在社员中展开了广泛的讨论。经讨论，社员们通过了“估产”预算，并且对分配办法提出了很多意见。根据全体社员的意见，并按照上级的指示，吸取了去秋今夏分配中的经验与教训，八月中旬把秋收分配的方案详细地制定了出来：
    “根据估产计算的结果：农业方面总收入一百零六万五千七百五十六斤粮食，折合款（以每斤六百五十元计）六亿九千二百七十四万一千四百元；副业方面总收入一亿零一百六十五万元。以上两宗总共收入折款七亿九千四百三十九万一千四百元。今年总共开支一亿九千一百八十五万八千元。全社全年劳动日总共是三万一千个。土地评产总共是五千一百六十二石五斗六。分配办法如下：
    一、本着以下两个原则进行分配：1、以劳力分红为主并兼顾土地的合理报酬；2、既要支援国家建设又要照顾社员需要。
    二、本社劳力土地的收益是采取比例分红制，牲畜是采取租用办法。确定从总收入中除去本年生产的总投资（包括牲畜租价、肥料、饲料、种籽等），再从纯收入里扣除百分之五的公积金和公益金，其余按劳力六成土地四成完全分配给社员。照此计算，应扣除公积金、公益金三千零一十二万六千六百七十元；每个劳动日应分红一万一千零七十八万元，每石产量的土地应分红四万四千三百五十元。
    三、关于出卖余粮和缴纳公粮问题。去秋是由各户自卖自缴；今夏是余粮集体卖公粮统一缴，卖了缴完，分别结算。根据这两次的经验，经过研究，大家都同意采用今年夏季的办法。具体的作法，分两个步骤：1、首先根据当地一般的生活水平，通过民主方式，统一定出每人每年的食粮标准数（此数应保证够吃），再按这个标准推算出各户通年的食粮数量，分给各户社员；然后，把其余粮食除扣除明年的必要投资（种籽、饲料）和留交全社各户应缴的公粮总数以外，所剩的粮食全部出卖给国家。2、从每户社员应分粮食的总数中减去食粮、投资和公粮的三项总和，留下的余数就是卖粮的数目；余数大的户卖的多分款多，余数小的户卖的少分款少。这样作有以下几个好处：（一）余粮公粮卖得快缴得早，并且手续简便误工少，粮食也少受损失，可以避免分配中的长退短补的麻烦和混乱现象；（二）更容易表现农业生产合作社的优越性，能树立社员们生产多卖粮多的光荣感；（三）既可以保证社员的食粮需要，又可以解决社内的投资问题。
    四、分配时间，决定还是照去年的样子，随打随分，打一场分一场。由于全社六个生产队今年所种土地的数量质量完全相同，同时农作物的种类和生长情况也大体一致，因此从收割到打场再到分配，一般采用以队为单位分配大宗作物的办法。又由于今年社员们所分到的粮食都是自己的食粮，所以预先各户要依据自己家里的人口多少，根据标准计算出需用多少，要哪一种粮食多少，社里根据各户自报情况来考虑统一筹划调剂。比如高粱、玉茭、谷子，虽系社员主要食粮，但因种植较多，不怕分配不来；唯有棉花、黄豆、绿豆、红薯和山药蛋等，也是全社各家很需要的，可是今年种的不太多，对此要用两种方法解决：（一）依据劳力土地的比例大小，参照社员人口多少分配；（二）有重点地分配给几户最需要的社员。同时，在进行上述分配中，粮食质量好坏搭配均匀非常重要。根据去年和今夏的分配经验需采用下列办法：一、打场时把好坏两种庄稼搭配开，打在一起。二、扬场后把上风头和下风头的粮食掺合均匀再分；三、把部分特别好的和特别坏的粮食留下来顶籽种饲料投资或顶公积金用。
    五、分配时以每斤谷子价六百五十元为计算标准，其它品种一律按此标准折合计算。
    六、对明年的籽种、饲料的投资办法，大家都愿意按各户社员的劳力、土地比例多少统一扣除，记到各户社员名下，做为他向社的投资，明年秋收后归还。这样做的好处是：（一）统一选种、保管，能确保籽种的质量；（二）公平合理，省事简便；（三）并不影响社员的实际收入和经济生活。为了照顾全社社员户户都有余粮可卖，所以在扣除饲料时投资要依具体情况，对有的户可酌量少扣除或不扣除（估计有三两户需要照顾）。
    七、秸草的分配办法：去年大家忽视了对秸草的分配，结果分配不当，造成混乱，社员们很有意见。今年决定采取这样一些办法来分：（一）由于牲畜都是社内公共喂养的，所以谷草、豆秸、角皮等除归还社员去年饲草投资外，其余统一留社作为全社饲草的集体投资；（二）玉茭秆这里牲畜不吃，当柴火烧也很困难，所以一律留社沤作肥料，作为全社集体投资；（三）因为本地的燃料较缺乏，因此所有的高粱秆按每户社员的人口多少需量大小分配给社员自用。
    八、几个具体问题的解决办法：（一）在基本建设方面用的劳动日，本年只算其中的一部分，以后逐年算清。（二）副业收入和农业劳动收入统一，以农副业劳动日平均计算分红。（三）因为今年的麦田不是全社统一经营，因此不采取两季统一分红和统一结算的办法。
    九、为做到手续简便有头有绪地进行，所以根据以生产队为单位进行分配的特点，规定：社里统一制发三联单据，分配时，社的会计依条子下账，队长依条子发粮，社员凭条子领粮；每分一场，队长把所剩的粮食交给保管员，保管员给队开条，由队转社下账。
    十、由于队的分配责任重大，所以确定社务委员分头到队具体协助，正副社长负责全面掌握。因为统一存放的粮食数量多，因此对库房和保管人员的准备与挑选工作更要作好，并且要有专人负责，贯彻始终。分配工作全部结束后，由社向全体社员公布分配结果。
    分配方案确定以后，社员们对今年全社和自己的“家底”摸清了。根据分配方案的标准计算：劳力多土地少的老社员韩臭会（全家七口人，五个劳力，十五亩多土地），估计今年可分一万零八百五十斤粮食，比他去年多分一千八百五十斤。土地多劳力少的新社员刘有礼（全家四口人，只有一个半劳力，有土地十七亩六分多）估计也可分到粮食五千四百三十八斤，比他去年单干时多分九百三十八斤。只有新社员刘月清，估算结果要比去年少收入二百斤粮食（去年一万零五百斤，今年一万零三百斤）；但是，他去年要雇两个月零十天的短工，需出工粮一千零七十八斤多；这样一算，他的实际收入还是比去年增加了。这样一算，社员们的思想进一步巩固起来了，连原来曾动摇过的周甲应、姚永昌等十几户社员，现在也安心了，劳动积极性也随着提高起来。
    在民主制订分配方案中间，又一次表明了农业生产合作社的优越性。根据“估产”预算，全社秋田每亩比去年多产粮食九十三斤。为什么能增产呢？社员们都清楚地懂得，是和国家的支持和帮助有着直接关系的。因此，为了支援国家建设，以便国家更好地帮助农民生产，大家决定除留下食粮、公粮和投资三项外，所剩粮食完全集体卖给国家。据初步预算，今秋可卖给国家粮食三十四万五千二百九十六斤。社里最贫困的一户，预计还有二百六十斤余粮可卖。在全社今年大增产后，达到了“户户有吃粮，家家卖余粮”的水平。
    现在，这个社正按照分配方案，结合生产积极进行秋收分配的准备工作：（一）组织分配粮食的机构，挑选保管人员；（二）准备仓库；（三）调查登记各个社员粮种需求情况；（四）修理和购置收割、打场和分配时所用的器具；印制分配所需的表格、单据等。今年的秋收分配工作，再也不会像去年那样乱了。
