Over the past four years, the state has adopted a policy of utilization, restriction, and transformation towards capitalist industry, encouraging and guiding them to transform into state capitalist economies. The advanced form of state capitalism – public-private joint ventures – has already seen considerable development. By the end of 1953, there were over a thousand public-private joint ventures nationwide. From the perspective of its total production value growth, the development speed is very fast. If we take the output value of public-private joint ventures in 1949 as 100, then it was 147.5 in 1950, 324.4 in 1951, 647.5 in 1952, and 916.9 in 1953. Its role in the national economy is also becoming increasingly significant. In the total national industrial output value, the output value of public-private joint ventures increased from 2% in 1949 to 6% in 1953. After the nationwide publicity of the state's general task during the transition period last year, the expansion of public-private joint ventures entered a new stage. According to statistics from eight major cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Xi'an, and Shenyang, in the first half of this year, 91 capitalist industrial enterprises have formally transformed into public-private joint ventures, and many more enterprises are preparing to carry out public-private joint ventures.

After these private factories became public-private joint ventures, due to the change in production relations, the incorporation of enterprise production into the national economic plan, and the improvement of enterprise management, production increased rapidly. For example, if we take the output of soda ash from the public-private joint venture Tanggu Yongli Chemical Plant in 1951 as 100, then it was 130 in 1952 and reached 149 in 1953; if we take the output of caustic soda in 1951 as 100, then it was 164 in 1952 and reached 188 in 1953. Another example is the Shanghai Huadong Steel Construction Factory. Before the public-private joint venture, production management was extremely chaotic. The theft of state property alone during the "Five-Anti" campaign amounted to more than 4.76 billion yuan. After the joint venture, workers strengthened supervision, improved business management, and increased labor efficiency. Within five months, they saved 26 tons of materials and 4,662 man-days by manufacturing equipment for the Sanhe Sluice project on the Huai River, reducing costs by more than 900 million yuan. The production efficiency of each type of work increased by 50% to 600%. Due to production development and improved management, enterprise profits increased, which not only benefited the capitalists but also accumulated funds for capital construction. For example, the public-private joint venture Tangshan Huaxin Cotton Textile Factory used production profits to build a new cotton mill in 1953 with 20,000 spindles, machines, and safety equipment that were better than the old factory, and put it into production. It is also planning to expand the new factory with 50,000 spindles and 2,000 looms with self-raised funds within five years. This is undoubtedly beneficial to meeting the needs of the country and the people, and to the cause of national socialist industrialization.

Due to the development of enterprise production, the working conditions and material lives of the workers have also been correspondingly improved. Taking the Minsheng Shipping Company as an example, in previous years, the temperature in the furnace and engine rooms of the ships was as high as 120 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer, and the workers were sweating all day long. Last summer, some ships were equipped with equipment to reduce the high temperature in the engine room. This year, six ships, including "Minquan" and "Minkang," were also equipped with blowers to reduce the high temperature in the engine room to about 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Hoisting tools and dock canopies have also been successively added to ports such as Chongqing, Yichang, and Hankou to gradually improve the working conditions of stevedores. A major safety inspection was also carried out last year, and after the inspection, 3,600 pieces of safety equipment were added to the ships and ashore. The first batch of employee dormitories newly built in Hankou, Yichang, and other places has been completed, and many employees have moved into new homes. The second batch of employee dormitories planned to be built in Hankou this year is also about to start construction. Over the past year, employee hospitals and employee sanatoriums have also been built, and larger ships have been equipped with health workers. After the public-private joint venture of the three yarn factories in Wuhan, Dahua, Yuhua, and Zhenhuan, last year they added a lot of ventilation and cooling equipment to ensure that the temperature in the workshops did not exceed 36.8 degrees Celsius even in the hottest weather in Wuhan. Each factory is building 5,000 workers' dormitories. Cooperatives, nurseries, and workers' children's schools are also being established. This is undoubtedly beneficial to encouraging employees to further engage in creative labor.

As enterprise production develops, management improves, and profits increase, capitalists also benefit. For example, in the five years since the public-private joint venture of Tangshan Huaxin Textile Company, the total dividend in 1949 was about 2.3 billion yuan, which had reached 14.4 billion yuan in 1952. This encouraged the enthusiasm of capitalists and their agents for production and operation, especially since capitalists and their agents can receive direct leadership and education from state cadres and help from the masses of employees in enterprises, and significant achievements have been made in enterprise transformation. All of this has enabled them to free themselves from the situation of pursuing profit and mainly serve production, contributing their talents to national construction, and also have a greater possibility to learn new things and new ideas in practice, and gradually transform themselves. Many capitalists have explained this point in their experiences after the public-private joint venture of their enterprises. For example, the private representative of Shanghai Huatong Electrical Switch Factory said with satisfaction after listening to the factory director's report at the board of directors: "The fact that our original dilapidated factory can achieve such vigorous development today fully demonstrates the benefits of public-private joint ventures in changing production relations. After the public-private joint venture, I was not responsible enough for the enterprise, and I must take responsibility in the future."

    全国各地公私合营企业日益发展
    四年来，国家对资本主义工业采取了利用、限制、改造的政策，鼓励和指导它们转变为国家资本主义的经济，其中高级形式的国家资本主义——公私合营，已经有了相当的发展。到一九五三年底为止，全国公私合营企业已有一千多户。从它的生产总值增长来看，发展速度是很快的。如以公私合营企业一九四九年的产值为一○○，则一九五○年为一四七·五，一九五一年为三二四·四，一九五二年为六四七·五，一九五三年为九一六·九。它在国民经济中的作用也日益显著，在全国工业总产值中，公私合营企业的产值一九四九年占百分之二，一九五三年增至百分之六。去年各地广泛宣传了国家过渡时期总任务以后，公私合营企业的扩展进入了新的阶段。今年上半年根据北京、天津、上海、武汉、广州、重庆、西安、沈阳八大城市的统计，已有九十一户资本主义工业正式转为公私合营企业，还有许多企业正在准备进行公私合营。
    这些私营工厂在公私合营之后，由于生产关系的改变，企业生产的纳入国家经济计划轨道，以及企业经营管理工作的改善，生产迅速增加，如公私合营塘沽永利碱厂纯碱的产量如以一九五一年为一○○，则一九五二年为一三○，一九五三年即达
  一四九；烧碱的产量以一九五一年为一○○，则一九五二年为一六四，一九五三年达一八八。又如上海华东钢铁建筑厂公私合营之前，生产管理混乱异常，单“五反”中清算盗窃国家资财即达四十七亿六千多万元，合营之后，工人加强了监督，改善了经营管理，发挥了劳动效率，五个月内为淮河三河闸工程制造器材即节约材料二十六吨，节省人工四千六百六十二个，降低成本九亿多元，各工种提高生产效率百分之五十至百分之六百。由于生产发展，经营管理改善，企业盈余增多，不但资本家有利可得，而且积累了资金从事基本建设。如唐山公私合营华新棉纺织厂用生产利润在一九五三年新建了一座有二万枚纱锭、机器和安全设备都比老厂好的棉纺厂，投入生产，并计划五年内再以自筹资金扩建纱锭五万枚、布机二千台的新厂。这无疑的对供应国家和人民的需要，对国家社会主义工业化的事业都是有利的。
    由于企业生产发展，工人的劳动条件和物质生活也有了相应的改善。如以民生轮船公司为例，往年一到夏季，轮船上炉舱、机舱的温度高达华氏一百二十度左右，工人整日汗流不止。去年夏季，有的轮船上装设了降低机舱高温的设备。今年“民权”、“民康”等六艘轮船也装上了打风机，把机舱的高温降到华氏一百度左右。在重庆、宜昌、汉口等港口也陆续添设了起重工具和栈道雨篷，逐步改善装卸工人的劳动条件。去年还举行了一次安全大检查，检查后在船上、岸上添设了三千六百多件安全设备。在汉口、宜昌等地新建的第一批职工宿舍已经落成，许多职工迁进了新居，今年计划在汉口兴建的第二批职工宿舍也要动工了。一年多以来，还建设了职工医院和职工疗养院，较大的船上都配备了保健员。武汉大华、裕华、震寰三个纱厂公私合营之后，去年都增加了不少通风降温设备，保证了车间温度在武汉最炎热的情况下，也不超过摄氏三十六点八度。各厂正修建五千间工人宿舍。合作社、托儿所和工人子弟学校也正在兴办。这对鼓励职工进一步从事创造性的劳动，无疑也是有利的。
    企业生产发展，经营改善，盈余也就增加，资本家也有利可得，如唐山华新纺织公司公私合营五年来，一九四九年股息总额约为二十三亿元，一九五二年即已达一百四十四亿元，这就鼓励了资本家及其代理人生产经营的积极性，尤其是资本家和他们的代理人在企业中能得到国家干部的直接领导与教育，职工群众的帮助，加以企业改造获得显著成绩，这都使他们能从钻营逐利的处境中解放出来，主要地为生产服务，贡献其才能于国家建设，而且也有更大的可能在实践中学习新事物新思想，逐步地改造自己。许多资本家对自己企业公私合营后的体会都说明了这一点。如上海华通电器开关厂私方代表在董监会上听了厂长的报告后满意地说：“我们原来这样破破烂烂的厂能得到今天这样蓬勃发展，充分说明了公私合营改变生产关系的好处。公私合营后，我对企业不够负责，今后一定要负起责任来。”
