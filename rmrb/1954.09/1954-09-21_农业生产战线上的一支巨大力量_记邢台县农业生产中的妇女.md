A Great Force on the Agricultural Production Front
    —Remembering Women in Agricultural Production in Xingtai County
    Zhang Dianyuan

    Xingtai County, Hebei, is an old liberated area. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the broad masses of women in the county, like the men, have undergone long-term revolutionary training. They were not only a tenacious force in the struggle against the enemy in the past, but also an important force in today's construction. Many model figures have emerged among them, who have been leading the women forward. Zhao Heini, the secretary of the Communist Party branch in Yang Village, District 7 of the county, joined the Party in 1938. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, she steadfastly persisted in her work despite the combined attacks of the Japanese invaders and the reactionary forces in her village. Once, Zhao Heini was caught by special agents. Although she was subjected to all kinds of torture, she did not reveal any secrets of the Party. After she recovered her health, she organized a women's intelligence group, transported grain to the troops, and threw herself into the heated struggle again. Now, as the country embarks on large-scale economic construction, Zhao Heini is leading the peasants to establish agricultural producers' cooperatives in her village, striving to complete the socialist transformation of agriculture. During the great famine of 1943, when the Party put forward the slogan of production for self-salvation to the masses in the liberated areas, Guo Aini, a textile expert from Zhehu Village, ran around teaching women in various villages textile techniques and taking apprentices. In just one year, more than 18,000 textile experts were trained throughout the county. In one year, the cloth woven from their spun yarn was exchanged for more than 2,000 shi of grain from Shanxi, which helped them to survive the famine. After 1948, women turned to participate in agricultural production. In order to solve the difficulty of women participating in agricultural production with no one to take care of their children, Guo Aini took the lead in establishing agricultural busy season childcare groups. Under her leadership, by 1952, the county had developed 480 childcare groups, allowing more than 20,000 mothers to participate in field production with peace of mind.

    After the founding of the People's Republic of China, through several political movements, especially after the announcement of the Party's general task for the transition period, and through in-depth publicity and education, the socialist consciousness of women in Xingtai County has been unprecedentedly raised. They actively participated in mutual aid and cooperative organizations. In the 535 agricultural producers' cooperatives in the county, there are a total of 20,284 laborers, of which 9,294 are women, accounting for more than 40 percent of the total labor force. Through the labor process, they have been trained, and many have become the backbone of leading production. According to statistics, 103 women in the county have served as directors or deputy directors of agricultural producers' cooperatives; and 1,126 women have served as members of the cooperative management committee, production team leaders or labor group leaders. These backbones have become leaders in taking the socialist road. The agricultural producers' cooperative led by Zhao Heini had only 27 households when it was established last year, and among these 27 households, 5 had no male labor, 6 households did not have enough grain to eat every year, and the whole cooperative only had six small donkeys and two old mules, which were very poor conditions. The members were uneasy, and her husband also expressed that he wanted to separate from her and work on his own. She patiently persuaded them one by one, and led the male and female members to overcome many difficulties such as the lack of manpower and animal power, and the fight against natural disasters. As a result, their cooperative's production volume was even higher than the yield in the bumper year of 1951. Their agricultural producers' cooperative was consolidated. For five years, whether it was fighting drought and digging wells, learning agricultural techniques, or other aspects, women throughout the county have played a huge role. In 1952, during the drought resistance and well-digging campaign launched throughout the county, women, like men, responded to this task. Wang Ziqi of Dongchuankou, District 5 of the county, led an agricultural producers' cooperative (in a mountainous area). That year, the plan was to dig five wells, requiring 3,400 workdays. However, the cooperative only had 75 able-bodied male laborers. Even if all of them were put into the well-digging work, it would take 30 days to complete, and it would also affect wheat hoeing, plowing, and other farm work. Everyone was worried. At the cooperative cadre meeting, Deputy Director Miao Jiu'e (female) said: "We women can do the same as hoeing wheat and carrying stones for well-digging." After research, it was decided that the male labor force would be divided to dig wells, and the female labor force would hoe wheat. The 52 women in the cooperative originally planned to complete the wheat hoeing task in five days, but they completed it in only three days. Then, 35 young and middle-aged women joined the well-digging work, allowing the cooperative to extract 20 male laborers for spring plowing, completing the spring plowing production in a timely manner, and the well-digging task was also completed three days ahead of schedule. During the selection of models, the cooperative selected 25 cooperative-loving models, of which eight first-class models were women. That spring, the original plan for Xingtai County was to dig 800 wells, but 1,160 wells were completed. That year, although the county suffered from wind and hail disasters, the grain crops increased by more than 17 percent compared to the bumper year of 1951. This achievement is inseparable from the active labor of women throughout the county.

    For five years, while participating in agricultural production, women have also actively learned agricultural techniques. Thanks to the attention of Party organizations and women's federations, and the adoption of methods such as men teaching women and taking apprentices, women have generally learned agricultural tasks such as thinning seedlings and hoeing the ground, managing cotton fields, treating seeds with pesticides, and selecting seeds. This year, the Zhehu Village Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in District 7 of the county has 123 female laborers contracted to plant 1,110 mu of cotton, freeing up 2,330 workdays for male laborers to do work such as repairing beaches and terraces, which is expected to increase grain production by more than 15,000 jin. This year, the Qianluzi Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in District 1 of the county has its entire 260 mu of cotton planted by women, freeing up male labor for land processing and increasing the planting of 13 mu of vegetable gardens. This year, the cooperative is expected to increase grain and vegetable production by more than 43 percent. In the 535 agricultural producers' cooperatives throughout the county, the vast majority of cotton operations are contracted by women. The cooperative members generally reflected that "women are shouldering half of the cooperative's production." Women also play a significant role in mountain area construction and the development of sideline occupations, participating in activities such as planting trees, afforestation, beekeeping, and silkworm rearing.

    农业生产战线上的一支巨大力量
    ——记邢台县农业生产中的妇女
    张殿元
    河北邢台县是老解放区。在中国共产党的领导下，全县广大妇女群众和男子一样地经受了长期革命锻炼。她们不仅在过去对敌斗争中曾经成为一支顽强的队伍；在今天的生产建设中，也成为一种重要的力量。她们中出现了许多模范人物，一直带领着妇女群众前进。该县七区内羊村中共支部书记赵黑妮，是一九三八年入党的。抗日战争时期，在日寇和本村反动势力联合夹击下，她始终如一地坚持着工作。一次，赵黑妮被特务抓住，她虽然经受了百般拷打，但没有暴露党的任何秘密。她等身体恢复健康以后，又组织起妇女情报组，给部队运粮食，又投入了火热的斗争中。现在，在国家开始大规模经济建设的时候，赵黑妮又带领着农民在本村建立农业生产合作社，为完成农业社会主义改造而奋斗了。当一九四三年大灾荒的时候，党向解放区人民群众提出了生产自救的口号，这时折虎村纺织能手郭爱妮就到处奔跑教给各村妇女纺织技术、带徒弟。只一年，全县就培养了一万八千多个纺织能手。一年中她们用自己纺的线织的布就从山西换回两千多石粮食，渡过了灾荒。一九四八年以后，妇女转而参加农业生产。郭爱妮为了解决妇女参加农业生产孩子没人照料的困难，首先创办了农忙托儿组。在她的带动下，到一九五二年全县就发展到四百八十个托儿组，使两万多位母亲安心参加田间生产。
    中华人民共和国成立以后，经过多次政治运动的锻炼，特别是国家在过渡时期的总任务宣布以后，经过深入的宣传和教育，邢台县妇女的社会主义觉悟空前提高了。她们积极地参加了互助合作组织。在全县五百三十五个农业生产合作社中，共有劳力两万零二百八十四个，其中妇女劳力是九千二百九十四个，占劳力总数的百分之四十以上。从劳动过程中，她们受到了锻炼，许多人已经成为领导生产的骨干。据统计，全县有一百零三名妇女担任了农业生产合作社的正副社长；有一千一百二十六名妇女担任了农业生产合作社的社务委员、生产队长或劳动组长等职务。这些骨干成了走社会主义道路的带头人。赵黑妮领导的农业生产合作社，在去年成立的时候，只有二十七户，而这二十七户中还有五户没男劳力，六户年年粮食不够吃，全社只六个小驴，两个老骡子，条件很不好。社员情绪不安，她丈夫也表示要和她分家单干。她耐心地一一说服了他们，并领导着男女社员克服了人力、畜力的不足，战胜了自然灾害等许多困难。结果他们社的生产量比一九五一年丰产年的产量还高。他们的农业生产合作社巩固了。五年以来，不论是抗旱打井，学习农业技术或其他方面，全县妇女都起了巨大的作用。一九五二年，在全县范围内开展的抗旱打井运动，妇女和男子同样地迎接了这一任务。该县五区东川口王致琪领导的农业生产合作社（山区），那一年计划打井五眼，需要用工三千四百个。但是全社整半男劳力只有七十五个，即使全部投入打井工作，也需三十天才能完成，而且还要影响锄麦、耕地等农活。大家都发了愁。在社干部会上，副社长苗九娥（女）表示：“我们妇女别说锄麦，打井扛石头也一样能干。”经研究以后，确定男劳力分工打井，女劳力锄麦。全社五十二个妇女，原计划五天完成锄麦任务，结果只用三天就锄完了。接着，三十五名青年和壮年妇女又参加打井工作，使社内得抽出了二十个男劳力进行春耕，适时完成了春耕生产，打井任务也提前三天完成。评选模范的时候，全社选出了二十五个爱社模范，其中有八个头等模范是妇女。那年春天，邢台全县原计划打井八百眼，结果完成了一千一百六十眼。那一年，全县虽然遭受风灾、雹灾，但粮食作物比丰收年一九五一年还增产百分之十七多。这成绩是和全县妇女的积极劳动分不开的。
    五年以来，妇女随着参加农业生产的同时，也积极地学习了农业技术。由于党组织和妇联的重视，采取了男教女学、带徒弟等办法，妇女们一般都学会了间苗锄地、管理棉田、药剂拌种和选种等农活。该县七区折虎村农业生产合作社今年有一百二十三个妇女劳力包种了棉花一千一百一十亩，使男劳力腾出两千三百三十个劳动日，去做修滩地和修梯田等活，预计可以增产粮食一万五千多斤。该县一区前炉子农业生产合作社，今年全社的二百六十亩棉花由妇女包种，腾出男劳力进行土地加工，并增种了十三亩菜园。该社今年预计可以增产粮食和蔬菜百分之四十三以上。全县五百三十五个农业生产合作社，在棉花作业上，绝大部分都由妇女包揽起来了。社员们普遍反映说：“妇女担负着社的一半的生产。”在山区建设和开展副业方面，妇女的作用也很大，她们参加了植树、造林、养蜂和养蚕等等方面的活动。
