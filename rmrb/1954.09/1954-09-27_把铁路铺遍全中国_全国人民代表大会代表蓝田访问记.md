    Spreading Railways Across China
    —An Interview with National People's Congress Representative Lan Tian
    By Our Correspondent Ji Xichen

    More than forty years ago, when Lan Tian was still studying, he, like tens of thousands of Sichuanese, dreamed of a railway traversing his vast homeland, the "Land of Abundance." This golden land abounds in rice, oranges, tobacco, coal, iron, salt, and sugar. However, without modern transportation, Sichuan's roads were as difficult as ascending to heaven! At that time, young Lan Tian thought: "How wonderful it would be to build a railway! That would make the people rich and the country strong..." With such hopes, he enrolled in the Chengdu Railway School of the Sichuan-Hankou Railway Company, which was funded by the people of Sichuan, in the late Guangxu period. Later, he transferred to Tangshan Industrial College, determined to master technology to serve the country. However, after graduation, he couldn't find a job, and his hopes turned into bubbles. In 1917, he found work on a railway in Northeast China, but the rights were controlled by the Japanese. The oppression, abuse, and shameless plunder of the imperialists aroused his anger, and he had to leave. He then worked on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi, Hunan-Guangxi railways, and the Sichuan-Kangding highway... For thirty years, he traveled across most of China. However, in old China, building railways was difficult, and even when railways were built, they only facilitated imperialist aggression and the plunder of the people by warlords and landlord-bureaucrats. In 1947, he returned to the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. This railway, for which the people of Sichuan had paid countless money, shed much blood, and waged many heroic and epic struggles, remained an unfinished dotted line after decades of turmoil.

    Engineer Lan Tian said: "After experiencing so much suffering, I gradually realized that without national independence and the liberation of the people, there could be no industrialization and transportation construction, and personal ideals could not be realized."

    After the liberation of Southwest China, when the great decision of the Central People's Government to build the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was announced, Lan Tian was moved to tears amid the jubilation of the masses. He was so happy and excited that he immediately plunged into the struggle to build the railway.

    As soon as the last rail of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was laid, the workers rushed to the construction site of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. The Baoji-Chengdu Railway crosses the turbulent currents of the Fu River, Tuo River, and Jialing River, and traverses the undulating and continuous Dabashan and Qinling mountain ranges for hundreds of kilometers, connecting to Baoji in Shaanxi and the Longhai Railway, tightly linking the Southwest with the Northwest and the rest of the country. This railway, which had been surveyed several times over 35 years under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government, had failed because the line could not pass through the Qinling Mountains. However, the difficult route could not stop the surveyors of New China. With the help of the masses along the line, engineering and technical personnel such as Lan Tian and Guo Yi, brought into play the collective creative power, and after eighteen months of hard work, successfully completed the route determination of the southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. The new route will save the country 1,200 billion yuan in construction costs by reducing bridges, tunnels, gradients, and mileage.

    Soon, Lan Tian received a new order and came to Yunnan to survey an even more arduous new line.

    "This road has just been born, that road has just started construction, and a new railway is already under survey and design. Such a rapid pace of railway construction, in the past, not only had never been seen, but even dared not be imagined!" Lan Tian said with joy, pointing to the railways appearing on the map, such as the Chengdu-Chongqing, Baoji-Chengdu, Tianshui-Lanzhou, Lanzhou-Xinjiang, and Laibin-Munanguan railways, and marveling at the great achievements of the motherland's construction.

    In the past five years, these newly built railways have attracted new regions to the country's construction, opened up new and vast sources for developing productive forces, and provided the possibility of changing the distribution of industry. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is called the "Road to Happiness" by the people. It not only transports large quantities of agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers, and inexpensive daily necessities from cities to rural areas, but also transports countless grains, non-staple foods, and industrial raw materials from rural areas to cities, promoting the prosperity of industrial and agricultural production along the line. It has also transported a large number of drilling equipment for the petroleum exploration areas and iron ore and coal mine exploration teams in Sichuan, preparing conditions for mobilizing Sichuan's rich underground mineral resources to participate in the country's construction.

    "But China's railway construction has only just begun," Lan Tian said excitedly. "With the development of heavy industry, railway construction will also develop accordingly. Our railway network will spread all over China, and our motherland will become more prosperous and strong."

    把铁路铺遍全中国
    ——全国人民代表大会代表蓝田访问记
    本报记者　纪希晨
    四十多年以前，蓝田还在学校里念书，他像成千成万的四川人一样，幻想着能有一条铁路横贯辽阔的“天府之国”的故乡。在这黄金似的地方，盛产着稻米、橘柑、烤烟、煤、铁、盐、糖。可是，没有现代交通的四川，蜀道难似上青天呵！当时，年青的蓝田想：“能修条铁路该多好？那样就会民富国强……”怀抱着这样的希望，他在光绪末年，考入了当时四川人民筹办的川汉铁路公司的成都铁道学堂，后来又转到唐山工业专门学校，一心想学好技术，报效祖国。可是毕业以后却找不到工作，希望变成了泡影。一九一七年虽然在东北一条铁路上找到了事做，但路权操在日本人手中。帝国主义的压迫、虐待和无耻的掠夺，激起他的愤怒，他不得不离开了那里，又先后辗转在浙赣、湘桂等铁路和川康公路上……三十年间，他走遍了大半个中国。可是，在旧中国，修铁路是件难事，修成了铁路也只不过是便利了帝国主义的侵略，便利了军阀混战和地主官僚们对人民的掠夺。一九四七年他回到了成渝铁路。这一条四川人民出过无数钱，流过不少血，进行过许多英勇、壮烈斗争的铁路，闹了几十年却仍然是一条未成的虚线。
    蓝田工程师说：“在经受这许多痛苦之后，我渐渐认识了：没有国家的独立，没有人民的解放，就谈不上工业化和交通建设，也无法实现个人的理想。”
    西南解放后，当中央人民政府兴修成渝铁路的伟大决策传出时，在万众欢腾的时刻里，蓝田感动得流泪了。他是那样欢喜，那样激动，立即就投身到筑路的斗争里去。
    成渝铁路的最后一根钢轨刚刚铺好，员工们又赶到修筑宝成路的工地上去了。宝成铁路跨过涪江、沱江、嘉陵江的激流，越过山峦起伏绵延数百公里的大巴山和秦岭山脉，到达陕西宝鸡和陇海铁路相通，把西南同西北及全国各地紧紧地连接起来了。这条在国民党反动政府统治下，三十五年间曾经数次勘测的铁路，都由于线路通不过秦岭山而失败了。可是艰险的线路却难不住新中国的勘测队员们。蓝田、郭彝等工程技术人员，在沿线群众帮助下，发挥集体创造力量，经过十八个月的辛勤努力，胜利完成了宝成路南段的定线工作。新线路由于减少桥梁、隧道、坡度和里程，将为国家节省建筑工程费一万二千亿元。
    不久，蓝田又奉到新的命令，来到云南，勘测工程更为艰巨的一条新线路。
    “这条路刚刚诞生，那条路又开始动工，而新的铁路却又在勘测设计中了。像这样突飞猛进的铁路建设速度，在过去不光没见过，就是连想也不敢想呵！”蓝田喜悦地指着出现在地图上的成渝、宝成、天兰、兰新和来宾到睦南关等地的铁路，惊叹着祖国建设的伟大成就。
    五年来，这些新建的铁路把一些新的地区吸引到国家的建设中来，开辟了发展生产力的新的巨大源泉，提供了改变工业分布的可能性。成渝铁路被人民称为“幸福之路”，她不仅把大批农业机械、化学肥料和廉价的生活日用品从城市运往农村，又从农村把无数的粮食、副食品、工业原料运往城市，繁荣了沿线的工农业生产，而且替四川的石油勘探区和铁矿、煤矿的勘探队运输了大批的钻探器材，为动员四川富饶的地下矿藏参加国家的建设准备了条件。
      “但中国的铁路建设只不过刚刚开始。”蓝田兴奋地说：“随着重工业的发展，铁路建设还要相应地发展，我们的铁路网将铺遍全中国，我们祖国会更加繁荣富强”。
