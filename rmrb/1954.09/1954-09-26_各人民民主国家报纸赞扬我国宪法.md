The Korean "Labor News" and "Democratic Korea"

    The Korean "Labor News" published a commentary on the 24th entitled "The Constitution of the Chinese People," stating: The adoption and promulgation of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China is not only a historic victory for the Chinese people, but also a major event of international significance. It clearly points out the direction of progress for all colonial and dependent peoples in their struggle against feudal and imperialist oppression and exploitation, and to forever get rid of slavery and poverty.

    The commentary continued: Every clause of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China embodies the will of the 600 million Chinese people. The Constitution of the People's Republic of China also embodies a lofty spirit of internationalism. The foreign policy of the People's Republic of China, based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity in establishing and developing diplomatic relations with any country, not only conforms to the Chinese people's demand for peaceful construction of their motherland, but also fully conforms to the common aspirations of peace-loving people around the world.

    The commentary concluded: The promulgation of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China not only further inspires the political enthusiasm of the Chinese people in their struggle to build socialism, but also further strengthens the confidence, fighting spirit, and new hope of peace-loving people around the world.

    The Korean "Democratic Korea" published an editorial on the 23rd entitled "A Historic Code Marking the Great Victory of the Chinese People," celebrating the birth of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China.

    The editorial stated: The Chinese people are convinced that the road to socialism is also the road that guarantees the Chinese people's freedom and independence, happiness and prosperity. The Constitution of the People's Republic of China will more powerfully inspire and promote the Chinese people's participation in the cause of socialist construction.

    The editorial pointed out: The adoption of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China not only has major historical significance in the political life of the Chinese people, but will also further inspire the Asian people in their struggle against imperialist oppression and exploitation and for national independence and freedom, strengthening their confidence in victory.

    The editorial concluded: At the time of the birth of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, the Korean people extend warm congratulations to the fraternal Chinese people. More brilliant victories and glory will belong to the Chinese people who are fighting for socialist construction and for peace and security in Asia and the world.

    Polish "People's Tribune"

    Warsaw dispatch from the Polish Press Agency: Polish newspapers published editorials and articles on the 24th, commenting on the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. The newspapers emphasized that this constitution is not only of great significance to China, but also of great significance to the world.

    "People's Tribune" wrote in an article entitled "A Historic Event in the Life of the Chinese People": The road of the People's Republic of China outlined in the constitution is a new victory for the invincible doctrine of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin; it enriches their doctrine with the experience of the world's largest country. At the same time, the adoption of this constitution will help to further unleash the creativity and initiative of the Chinese people, and will arm them to wage a tenacious and victorious struggle against all those who are hostile to their new life, and for the victory of socialism.

    The article continued: The adoption of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China is an event that helps to further strengthen the forces of the world peace camp, which is led by the Soviet Union and is waging an increasingly effective struggle to consolidate peace and resolve international disputes through consultation, and to further ease international tensions. People's China, as a peaceful great power, is playing an increasingly important role in this victorious struggle. Public opinion in capitalist countries is also increasingly clearly seeing this fact, and they are demanding that the government of the People's Republic of China should obtain its legitimate position in the United Nations.

    "People's Tribune" concluded: The Polish people and the people of all countries in the great camp of peaceful democratic socialism are rejoicing and proud of the adoption of their constitution together with the fraternal Chinese people.

    Czechoslovak Newspapers

    The Czechoslovak "Red Right" and "Truth" newspapers warmly congratulated the birth of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China.

    "Red Right" published an editorial on the 23rd stating: The Constitution of the People's Republic of China embodies the long-term aspirations of the broad masses of the Chinese people, because it records the achievements of the Chinese people's long-term struggle and embodies all the fundamental changes brought about by the victory of the Chinese people's revolution. At the same time, this constitution is also a historic document of international significance.

    The editorial then analyzed the basic contents of the constitution, explaining the enormous superiority of this socialist-type constitution over capitalist-type constitutions. In discussing the constitution's declaration that China will unswervingly strive for the noble goals of world peace and human progress, the editorial emphasized that this provision, as well as the development of friendly relations between China and all peace-loving countries, once again makes the whole world recognize that People's China hopes to live in peace and hopes to work for the prosperity of the country. Therefore, it should fully obtain its legitimate position on the international stage. But until now, certain capitalist countries, under pressure from the United States, have been opposing it obtaining this legitimate position.

    The editorial concluded that the Czechoslovak people are proud to congratulate the great Chinese people at this meaningful moment, wishing them further achievements in their future work of developing their motherland, and in their struggle to ease international tensions and develop international friendly relations. The camp of peace and socialism headed by the Soviet Union is strong, and a strong component of it is the People's Republic of China. The strengthening of the Chinese people's democratic system means the strengthening of this camp, meaning the strengthening of mankind's hope for happiness and peaceful life.

      "Truth" (organ of the Slovak Communist Party) pointed out in an article on the 22nd: The Constitution of the People's Republic of China is a brilliant document of our time. It shows the great achievements made by the people who have broken the shackles of colonial slavery and feudal oppression, and shows the firm determination of the Chinese people to build socialism in their free country. "Truth" also said that friends of People's China know that this constitution will help to further strengthen this young democratic country, thereby helping to further strengthen the great cause of peace and international friendship.

    Bulgarian "Workers' Cause"

The editorial said that the Bulgarian people and all progressive mankind, together with the 600 million Chinese people, are rejoicing for the great victory and bright future of the Chinese people. An unbreakable fraternal friendship, the common cause of building socialism and defending world peace, unites the people of our two countries. When the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China adopted the Constitution of the People's Republic of China - the fundamental law for the further development of great China - the people of our country expressed their heartfelt congratulations to the great Chinese people. Our working people wish the Chinese people new victories and achievements in building their great and strong country, in building a new life, and in the struggle to consolidate universal peace.

It reflects the struggle of the Chinese people, under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party, to get rid of the shackles that the colonialists have placed on them for a long time, and to build a new life; it reflects the common aspirations of the 600 million Chinese people to build a socialist society. This constitution affirms precisely this fundamental change in the life of the Chinese people, this brilliant and splendid road.
