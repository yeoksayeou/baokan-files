    The Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    Seriously Handles the Wang Zhaojun Frame-up Incident

    The Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party seriously handled the Wang Zhaojun frame-up incident. Wang Zhaojun was the former head of the Propaganda Department of the Yancheng County Committee. At the beginning of the "Three-Anti" movement in 1952, he was subjected to organized and planned attacks and frame-ups led by Zhou Gang (former secretary of the County Committee) and Jiao Guangliang (former deputy secretary of the County Committee) because he exposed the extravagance and waste of the County Committee and Zhou Gang's unauthorized use of party fees to purchase public materials at low prices and other mistakes. They fabricated five charges against Wang Zhaojun, including "surrendering to the enemy, extorting the masses, killing peasants, attacking village cadres, and concealing his landlord status." The Xuchang Prefectural Committee, believing their false report, made a series of erroneous decisions against Wang Zhaojun, such as "suspension for reflection," "suggestion to the government for detention," and even "expulsion from the Party," resulting in Wang Zhaojun's detention for half a year. Wang Zhaojun appealed to the higher Party committee. On April 3, 1953, the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Central China Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Henan Provincial Committee, and the Xuchang Prefectural Committee jointly formed an inspection team to conduct inspections in Yancheng. Zhou Gang and Jiao Guangliang manipulated the County Committee at every level to set up defenses and resist inspection. On April 14, the inspection team finally broke through the "blockade" of Zhou Gang and Jiao Guangliang and exposed all their evil deeds. At this time, Zhou Gang still insisted on not admitting his mistakes, while Jiao Guangliang fled in fear of punishment (but later returned). In order to uphold Party discipline, the Henan Provincial Committee made a decision in February 1954 to abolish the former Yancheng County Committee and form a new County Committee, expel Zhou Gang and Jiao Guangliang from the Party, and suggest that the government punish them according to law. Other relevant personnel were given penalties such as expulsion from the Party, dismissal from work, warnings, and admonitions, depending on the severity of their mistakes. The Xuchang Prefectural Committee committed serious bureaucracy in handling the Wang Zhaojun persecution case. The Henan Provincial Committee decided to criticize them and give public warnings to the Secretary of the Prefectural Committee Ji Denggui and Deputy Secretary Zhao Tianxi and others. Wang Zhaojun was wrongly expelled from the Party for reporting violations of laws and discipline. The Xuchang Prefectural Committee has restored his Party membership. Zhang Sixue, an inspector of the Prefectural Discipline Inspection Committee, was commended by the Henan Provincial Committee for upholding the truth and reporting all the mistakes of the former Yancheng County Committee to higher authorities.

    In the process of leading the entire Party in Henan to deeply study the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party, the Henan Provincial Committee announced on July 3, 1954, the "Decision on Handling the Case of Comrade Wang Zhaojun Being Framed" and the "Investigation Report on the Case of Comrade Wang Zhaojun Being Framed" by the Henan Provincial Committee's Discipline Inspection Committee and other documents. At the same time, the Henan Provincial Committee issued instructions, calling on all Party members in Henan to immediately organize the study and discussion of this incident in conjunction with the study of the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session, conscientiously learn the lessons of this incident, and overcome the ideological influence of bourgeois individualism and complacency within the Party. At present, the study and discussion of the Wang Zhaojun frame-up incident has been widely launched by Party organizations at all levels in Henan. Many secretaries of prefectural committees and county committees have successively published articles in the Henan Daily, criticizing the evil acts of Zhou Gang and Jiao Guangliang in suppressing and framing critics. At the same time, they have also conducted a relatively deep examination of the work situation and ideological situation in their respective regions. They unanimously stated that in order to continue to deeply implement the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party, they must profoundly remember the lessons of the Wang Zhaojun frame-up incident, fully develop intra-Party democracy, develop intra-Party criticism and self-criticism, and wage a resolute struggle against all acts of suppressing criticism and framing critics.

    中共河南省委员会
    严肃处理王兆钧被陷害事件
    中共河南省委严肃地处理了王兆钧被陷害事件。王兆钧是前郾城县委会宣传部部长，在一九五二年“三反”运动开始时，因检举该县委机关的铺张浪费及县委书记周刚擅自动用党费，贱价收买公共物资等错误，遭到了以周刚、焦光亮（前县委副书记）为首的有组织有计划的打击和陷害。他们给王兆钧捏造了“曾投敌自首、敲诈群众、杀害农民、打击村干部、隐瞒地主成分”等五条罪状。许昌地委听信了他们的假报告，便对王兆钧做出了“停职反省”、“建议政府扣押”、甚至“开除党籍”等一连串的错误决定，使王兆钧被扣押达半年之久。王兆钧向上级党委提出申诉。一九五三年四月三日，中共中央中南局纪律检查委员会、河南省委纪律检查委员会和许昌地委，共同组成检查组前往郾城进行检查，周刚、焦光亮又操纵县委会层层布置防线，抵抗检查。至四月十四日，检查组终于突破了周刚、焦光亮的“封锁线”，揭露了他们的全部罪恶事实。这时，周刚仍然坚持不承认错误，焦光亮则畏罪潜逃（后又返回）。为了严肃党纪，河南省委于一九五四年二月作出了决定，将前郾城县委会撤销，另组新的县委会，将周刚、焦光亮开除出党，并建议政府依法惩办，对其他有关人员，均根据其所犯错误的程度，分别给予了开除党籍、撤销工作、警告、劝告等处分。许昌地委在处理王兆钧被害事件中，犯了严重的官僚主义，河南省委决定给以指责处分，并给地委书记纪登奎、副书记赵天锡等人以当众警告处分。王兆钧因检举违法乱纪分子竟被开除党籍是冤枉的，许昌地委已恢复其党籍。对地委纪律检查委员会检查员张思学，因他坚持真理向上级揭发了前郾城县委的全部错误，河南省委决定予以表扬。
    河南省委在领导河南全党深入学习党的四中全会决议的过程中，于一九五四年七月三日公布了“关于王兆钧同志被陷害事件的处理决定”和河南省委纪律检查委员会“关于王兆钧同志被陷害事件的检查报告”等文件，同时，河南省委并发出指示，号召河南党组织全体党员结合对四中全会决议的学习，立即组织对这一事件的学习和讨论，认真吸取这一事件的教训，克服党内所存在的资产阶级个人主义的思想影响和骄傲自满情绪。目前，河南省各级党组织对王兆钧被陷害事件的学习讨论，已广泛展开，许多地委书记、县委书记先后在河南日报上发表文章，批判周刚、焦光亮打击陷害批评者的罪恶行为，同时对自己地区的工作情况、思想情况也作了比较深刻的检查，一致表示，为了继续深入贯彻党的四中全会决议，必须深刻记取王兆钧被陷害事件的教训，充分发扬党内民主，发展党内批评和自我批评，向一切压制批评打击陷害批评者的行为，进行坚决的斗争。
