    The Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society held its second National Member Representative Conference in Beijing from August 18th to 23rd. More than 40 delegates from local branches and specially invited representatives attended the conference. Based on the current situation of China's machinery manufacturing industry, the conference discussed in detail the issue of standardization of mechanical industry specifications. The delegates unanimously agreed that in promoting mechanical engineering standardization, Soviet existing standards should be tried first to solve some urgent problems, and then China's standard plan should be gradually formulated in combination with China's specific conditions. The representatives put forward preliminary opinions on the formulation and implementation of various major standards for the reference of government departments. The representatives also conducted academic discussions and made many suggestions on the development of the Society's work.

    From August 9th to 19th, the Chinese Geographical Society held its first academic discussion meeting in Beijing. The discussion meeting focused on the division of natural and economic regions in our country in combination with the needs of national production and construction. More than 40 representatives of members of the Chinese Geographical Society and more than 30 representatives from other relevant units attended the discussion meeting.
    The discussion meeting first clarified that the purpose of dividing natural regions and economic regions is to meet the needs of production, economic construction, and cultural construction—geography teaching in schools and comprehensive research work, among which serving agricultural production is the main task.
    Regarding the division of natural regions in our country, most people at the meeting believed that it should be divided into seven major regions; the standard for the division is based on the comprehensive characteristics of climate, topography, hydrology, soil, plants, and animals, with climate as the main standard. Regarding the division of economic regions in our country, the representatives all believed that it should be based on principles such as economy, ethnicity, and administrative division. The representatives all realized that the division of economic regions is an organizational form of national leadership in economic construction and one of the main bases for the country to formulate construction plans. The conference discussed in detail the preliminary plan for dividing natural regions and economic regions.
    The discussion meeting also studied the current research direction of geographers across the country, pointing out the path for geographers to combine geographical research with reality. The meeting believed that in terms of economic geography, the focus should be on the investigation and research of agriculture and handicrafts; in terms of physical geography, the focus should be on regional comprehensive investigation and research of agricultural natural conditions, and in addition, foreign geography and some theoretical issues of geography should also be studied.

    中国地理学会讨论我国自然和经济区域划分问题
    中国机械工程学会自八月十八日到二十三日在北京举行第二次全国会员代表大会。参加大会的有各地分会代表和特邀代表共四十多人。大会根据我国机械制造工业的现状，详细讨论了机械工业的规格化标准化问题，到会代表一致认为在推行机械工程标准化方面应当首先试用苏联的现行标准，解决一些急迫的问题，然后逐步结合我国具体情况，制订我国的标准方案。代表们提出了关于制订和推行各项主要标准的初步意见，提供政府业务部门参考。代表们还进行了学术讨论，对发展学会的工作也提了许多建议。大会通过了章程，并选出了新的理事会。　（新华社）
    八月九日至十九日，中国地理学会在北京举行第一次学术讨论会，讨论会结合国家生产和建设的需要，着重讨论了关于我国自然区域和经济区域的划分问题。参加讨论会的有中国地理学会会员代表四十多人以及其他有关单位的代表三十多人。
    讨论会首先明确了自然区域和经济区域划分的目的是为了适应生产、经济建设和文化建设——学校地理教学和综合性的研究工作的需要，其中又以服务于农业生产为主要任务。
    关于我国自然区域的划分，会上大多数人认为应划分为七个大区；划区的标准是根据气候、地形、水文、土壤、植物、动物的综合特征，而以气候为主要标准。关于我国经济区域的划分，与会代表都认为应根据经济、民族和行政区划等原则。代表们都认识到经济区域的划分是国家领导经济建设的一种组织形式，也是国家制订建设计划的主要根据之一。会议详细地讨论了划分自然区域和经济区域的初步方案。
    讨论会还研究了全国地理工作者当前研究工作的方向，指出了地理工作者地理研究工作结合实际的道路。会议认为：在经济地理方面，应着重对农业和手工业的调查研究；自然地理方面，应着重对农业自然条件的区域性综合调查研究，此外并应该研究外国地理和地理学的一些理论问题。
