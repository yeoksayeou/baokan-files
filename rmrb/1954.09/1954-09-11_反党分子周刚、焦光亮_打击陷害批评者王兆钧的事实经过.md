The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China seriously dealt with the case of Wang Zhaojun, the former head of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Yancheng County Committee, who was framed by Zhou Gang, the former secretary of the Yancheng County Committee, Jiao Guangliang, and others.

In January 1952, when the "Three-Anti" campaign began, Wang Zhaojun, the former Minister of Propaganda of the Yancheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China, reported to the Henan Provincial Committee and the Xuchang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China about the extravagant waste of the Yancheng County Committee organs and the mistakes of Zhou Gang and others in using their power to cheaply buy confiscated public materials. The Xuchang Prefectural Committee failed to take a responsible attitude to resolutely protect and seriously deal with this exposure, but instead handed Wang Zhaojun's letter of complaint back to the former Yancheng County Committee for them to review. After seeing Wang Zhaojun's letter of complaint, Zhou Gang, the secretary of the County Committee, and Jiao Guangliang, the deputy secretary, not only did not examine themselves, but instead believed that Wang Zhaojun "wanted to take advantage of the situation, sow discord, and deliberately bring them down." That night, Zhou Gang immediately convened a meeting of the County Committee, questioning Wang Zhaojun's motives for reporting, and slandered Wang, saying: "Wang Zhaojun is an object of the 'Three-Anti' campaign, sowing discord within the Party, attacking activists, and using hooligan tactics." Other members of the County Committee not only did not criticize and stop Zhou Gang's bad behavior of suppressing democracy and retaliating against critics from the Party's standpoint, but instead violated Party principles and jointly struggled against Wang Zhaojun, forcing Wang Zhaojun to withdraw his opinions. Later, the Xuchang Prefectural Committee received Wang Zhaojun's complaint materials transferred from the Henan Provincial Committee, and then sent Zhang Sixue, an inspector from the Prefectural Committee's Discipline Inspection Committee, to the former Yancheng County Committee to verify the materials. At this time, Zhou Gang and Jiao Guangliang still did not humbly examine themselves and continued to struggle against Wang Zhaojun. Zhang Sixue criticized them at the time, and after returning to the office, he reported to the Prefectural Committee the materials Wang Zhaojun reported that were true and the situation of Zhou Gang and Jiao Guangliang retaliating against Wang Zhaojun. However, Zhang Sixue's report did not attract the attention of the Xuchang Prefectural Committee. The problem was delayed. This gave Zhou Gang and Jiao Guangliang further opportunities to attack Wang Zhaojun.

Wang Zhaojun always insisted on fighting against Zhou Gang and Jiao Guangliang's mistakes and retaliatory behavior. Seeing that threatening Wang Zhaojun had failed, Zhou Gang and Jiao Guangliang did not hesitate to adopt all kinds of despicable means and began a planned and organized campaign to frame Wang Zhaojun. They collected Wang Zhaojun's shortcomings or mistakes in his work everywhere and publicized Wang Zhaojun's individual mistakes in history; they twice sent cadres to the countryside to mobilize farmers to accuse Wang Zhaojun to the newspaper and the County Committee. When this still could not achieve the purpose of framing Wang Zhaojun, Zhou Gang and Jiao Guangliang sent Ren Xueshu, an officer of the Organization Department of the County Committee, to Wang Zhaojun's native home in Tancheng County, Shandong Province, to collect Wang Zhaojun's historical materials in February of the same year. In order to cater to the personal ill intentions of Zhou Gang and Jiao Guangliang, Ren Xueshu consciously expanded and fabricated materials, saying that Wang Zhaojun's past participation in agricultural labor at home, which was a middle peasant component, was "not laboring" and a "landlord component"; he said that Wang Zhaojun had done underground work during the War of Resistance Against Japan, saying that he was "carrying out counter-revolutionary activities." After Jiao Guangliang obtained these materials, he asked Ren Xueshu to report to the Prefectural Committee. At this time, Wang Zhaojun went to the Prefectural Committee three more times to appeal, requesting the Prefectural Committee to quickly send someone to stop Zhou Gang and others' illegal and undisciplined behavior. The Prefectural Committee pushed it to be resolved in the "Three-Anti" campaign. In April of the same year, Zhou Gang and Jiao Guangliang again instructed Niu Peifa and Ren Xueshu to go to Wang Zhaojun's hometown in Shandong to further collect Wang Zhaojun's historical materials. Under the instructions of Zhou Gang and others, Niu Peifa and Ren Xueshu completely lost the Party's principles and stance, changed their names and surnames, impersonated cadres of the Tancheng County Committee, threatened village cadres to fight against Wang Zhaojun's mother and younger brother, and attacked and intimidated farmers who revealed the truth. In this way, they reversed right and wrong, confused black and white, and fabricated five major crimes for Wang Zhaojun out of thin air, such as "surrendering to the enemy, extorting the masses, killing farmers, attacking village cadres, and concealing the landlord component." Zhou Gang and Jiao Guangliang used this as the "basis" to deploy Ren Xueshu to convene a meeting, saying, "Wang Zhaojun has blood debts, everyone must be vigilant," and searched Wang Zhaojun's residence, placing Wang Zhaojun under rotating surveillance. At the same time, they called the Prefectural Committee and said: "Wang Zhaojun's problem is serious." On May 9th of the same year, Zhou and Jiao sent Wang Xiwang, the Minister of the Organization Department of the County Committee, to lead Niu Peifa, Ren Xueshu, and others to make a false report to Zhao Tianxi, the Deputy Secretary of the Xuchang Prefectural Committee, repeatedly emphasizing that "Wang Zhaojun's problem is serious" and requesting the Prefectural Committee to deal with it quickly. The Xuchang Prefectural Committee was deceived by their false report and wrongly decided that Wang Zhaojun should be suspended from his duties for self-reflection. On the evening of May 10th of the same year, Zhou Gang again called to urge the Xuchang Prefectural Committee to deal with it quickly. The Prefectural Committee then suggested that Wang Zhaojun be detained. This further condoned the illegal and undisciplined behavior of Zhou Gang and Jiao Guangliang. At that time, Zhou Gang happily said: "Wang Zhaojun said we have factionalism. I think we are lucky to be holding tight, otherwise we wouldn't be able to deal with this kid."

After Wang Zhaojun suffered this unexpected attack and retaliation, he repeatedly appealed to the Xuchang Prefectural Committee, requesting them to send someone to investigate and deal with it. At this time, the Xuchang Prefectural Committee sent people to Wang Zhaojun's hometown to investigate, but because the investigators did not go deep into the masses, the investigation results were roughly the same as Zhou Gang and Jiao Guangliang's false report, and no conclusion could be made. On September 30th of the same year, the Prefectural Committee released Wang Zhaojun. In order to clarify the problem, the Prefectural Committee sent Zhang Shusen and others to Shandong to investigate Wang Zhaojun's historical situation. Because Zhang Shusen and others still did not go deep into the masses, the materials investigated were roughly the same as before; Zhang Shusen and others reported to the Tancheng County Committee, and the Tancheng County Committee wrote a written certificate in the name of the County Committee. Based on the materials from the two investigations and the written certificate from the Tancheng County Committee, the Prefectural Committee concluded that Wang Zhaojun was a "class alien" and expelled Wang Zhaojun from the Party. Wang Zhaojun disagreed with this treatment. The Xuchang Prefectural Committee again suggested that Wang Zhaojun be detained. During his detention, Wang Zhaojun wrote more than ten letters to the Xuchang Prefectural Committee to appeal, but this did not attract the attention of the Xuchang Prefectural Committee. On December 12th of the same year, Li Xianglin of the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Henan Provincial Committee went to the Xuchang Prefectural Committee to inspect work. After hearing Wang Zhaojun's appeal, he suggested to the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Xuchang Prefectural Committee to release Wang Zhaojun and assign him work, with the historical issue temporarily suspended. However, the Xuchang Prefectural Committee did not handle it this way. Later, under the repeated urging of the Henan Provincial Committee, although the Xuchang Prefectural Committee released Wang Zhaojun and assigned him work on January 22, 1953, it still delayed dealing with the entire case. It was not until Zhang Sixue reported all the criminal activities of Zhou Gang, Jiao Guangliang, and others to the Central South Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Central South Bureau instructed the Henan Provincial Committee to inform the Xuchang Prefectural Committee to conduct an inspection by telegram, that the Xuchang Prefectural Committee actively sent people to the former Yancheng County Committee to conduct an inspection. However, because Zhou Gang and Jiao Guangliang insisted on their mistakes and cunningly denied them, the two inspections did not yield results. In April 1953, the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Henan Provincial Committee, together with cadres from the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Central South Bureau and the person in charge of the Xuchang Prefectural Committee, went to Yancheng for inspection. At this time, the illegal and undisciplined activities of Zhou Gang and Jiao Guangliang had reached their peak and were completely opposed to the Party. Before the inspection team arrived in Yancheng, Zhou Gang (who had been transferred from his job) received the news and discussed with Jiao Guangliang and others several times on how to deal with the inspection. They also agreed with each other to "resolutely deny any retaliatory behavior and resolutely fight to the end." From April 10th to 16th, Zhou Gang called Jiao Guangliang four times, telling him to "calm down" and "prepare well." During the inspection, Jiao Guangliang superficially dealt with the inspection team, but behind their backs, they convened meetings of the County Committee three times in a row, and conducted individual conversations with relevant personnel to deploy blockades at all levels and obstruct the inspection everywhere. They also spread rumors among the cadres, saying that "the inspection team is arrogant and powerful." Even worse, Jiao Guangliang burned evidence and threatened and bribed cadres who revealed the truth to keep secrets for him. Finally, when the truth was fully revealed, Jiao Guangliang fled in fear of punishment (but later returned), while Zhou Gang still insisted on his mistakes and refused to examine himself. At this point, they openly betrayed the Party and the people and embarked on a dead end.

According to the inspection report of the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Henan Provincial Committee on the Wang Zhaojun framing case, the former Yancheng County Committee had been completely corrupted by bourgeois individualism and liberalism and had lost the role of a Party organization. In order to enforce Party discipline, the Henan Provincial Committee has decided to revoke the County Committee organs and reorganize a new County Committee; Zhou Gang, Jiao Guangliang, Ren Xueshu, Niu Peifa, and others have been expelled from the Party, and other relevant personnel have been given punishments such as removal from work, warnings, and admonitions according to the severity of their mistakes. Ji Dengkui, the Secretary of the Xuchang Prefectural Committee, Zhao Tianxi, the Deputy Secretary, and Liu Ping, the Deputy Secretary of the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Prefectural Committee, have all been given public warnings. Wang Zhaojun was wronged for being attacked and framed for reporting illegal and undisciplined elements, and the Xuchang Prefectural Committee has restored his Party membership.

    反党分子周刚、焦光亮
    打击陷害批评者王兆钧的事实经过
    中共河南省委严肃地处理了前郾城县委书记周刚、焦光亮等人陷害前郾城县委宣传部长王兆钧事件。
    一九五二年一月，“三反”运动开始时，前中共郾城县委宣传部部长王兆钧，向中共河南省委、许昌地委检举了郾城县委机关铺张浪费，以及周刚等人利用职权贱买没收公共物资等错误。许昌地委对这一揭发未能认真负责予以坚决保护和严肃处理，却将王兆钧的检举信交回了前郾城县委会，让他们进行检讨。县委书记周刚、副书记焦光亮见到王兆钧的检举信以后，不但不检讨，反而认为王兆钧“想钻空子，挑拨离间，有意搞垮自己”。周刚当天晚上即召开县委会议，追问王兆钧的检举动机，并侮蔑王说：“王兆钧是‘三反’对象，在党内挑拨离间，打击积极分子，耍流氓手段。”其他县委委员对周刚这种压制民主、打击报复批评者的恶劣行为，不但没有站在党的立场上予以批判和制止，相反地竟违背党的原则，共同向王兆钧进行斗争，强迫王兆钧收回自己的意见。后来许昌地委接到了河南省委转来的王兆钧的检举材料才派地委纪律检查委员会检查员张思学到前郾城县委会查对材料。这时，周刚、焦光亮仍不虚心检讨自己，并向王兆钧进行斗争。当时，张思学向他们提出了批评，回机关后，又将王兆钧检举属实的材料及周刚、焦光亮打击报复王兆钧的情况，向地委作了报告。但是张思学的报告并没有引起许昌地委的注意。问题拖延了下去。这就使周刚、焦光亮获得了进一步打击王兆钧的机会。
    王兆钧对周刚、焦光亮的错误和打击报复行为，始终坚持斗争。周刚、焦光亮看到对王兆钧施用恫吓已不能得逞，便不惜采用种种卑鄙手段，对王兆钧开始了有计划有组织的陷害活动。他们到处搜集王兆钧在工作中的缺点或错误，宣传王兆钧历史上的个别错误；两次派干部下乡动员农民向报社、县委控告王兆钧。在这样做还不能达到陷害王兆钧的目的时，周刚、焦光亮又于同年二月派县委会组织部干事任学恕到王兆钧的原籍山东省郯城县去搜集王兆钧的历史材料。任学恕为了迎合周刚、焦光亮的个人不良意图，有意识地扩大与捏造材料，把王兆钧过去在家参加农业劳动，是中农成分，说成是“不劳动”、“地主成分”；把王兆钧在抗日战争时期，作过地下工作，说成是“进行反革命活动”。焦光亮得这些材料后，便叫任学恕向地委报告。这时王兆钧又三次到地委申诉，要求地委迅速派人制止周刚等违法乱纪行为。地委推说到“三反”中解决。同年四月间，周刚、焦光亮又指使牛培法、任学恕到山东王兆钧家乡进一步搜集王兆钧的历史材料。牛培法、任学恕在周刚等指使之下，完全丧失了党的原则、立场，改名换姓，冒充郯城县委干部，威胁村干部斗争王兆钧的母亲和弟弟，并打击恐吓暴露真情的农民。就这样颠倒是非，混淆黑白，给王兆钧凭空捏造了“投敌自首，敲诈群众，杀害农民，打击村干部，隐瞒地主成分”等五大罪状。周刚、焦光亮就以此作“根据”，一面布置任学恕召集会议，说“王兆钧有血债，大家要提高警惕”，并搜查了王兆钧的住室，对王兆钧实行轮流看守，一面打电话给地委说：“王兆钧问题严重”。同年五月九日，周、焦又派县委组织部部长王希旺带领牛培法、任学恕等人，向许昌地委副书记赵天锡作假报告，一再强调“王兆钧问题严重”，要求地委赶快处理。许昌地委为他们的假报告所蒙蔽，错误地决定王兆钧停职反省，同年五月十日晚，周刚又打电话督促许昌地委赶快处理。地委即建议将王兆钧予以扣押。这就更加纵容了周刚、焦光亮违法乱纪行为。当时周刚曾兴高采烈地说：“王兆钧说我们有宗派，我看幸亏我们抱的紧，不然整不了这小子。”
    王兆钧遭到这种意外打击报复之后，曾屡次向许昌地委提出申诉，要求派人调查处理。这时，许昌地委即派人到王兆钧的原籍进行调查，但由于调查人员没有深入群众，调查结果都与周刚、焦光亮的假报告大体相同，无法作结论。同年九月三十日，地委将王兆钧释放。地委为了弄清问题，又派张树森等人去山东调查王兆钧历史情况。由于张树森等仍未深入群众，调查的材料又与以前的大致相同；张树森等向郯城县委作了汇报，郯城县委即以县委名义写来书面证明。地委根据两次调查的材料及郯城县委的书面证明，便给王兆钧作了“阶级异己分子”的结论，将王兆钧开除出党。王兆钧不同意这样处理。许昌地委又建议将王兆钧扣押起来。王兆钧在扣押期间，仍给许昌地委写信十余封，进行申诉，也没有引起许昌地委注意。同年十二月十二日，河南省委纪律检查委员会李祥林到许昌地委检查工作时，听了王兆钧的申诉，即向许昌地委纪律检查委员会建议释放王兆钧并分配其工作，历史问题暂作悬案。但许昌地委并没有这样处理。后来，许昌地委在河南省委的一再督促之下，虽然于一九五三年一月二十二日将王兆钧释放，并分配了工作，但对整个案件仍然迟迟不作处理。直到张思学向中共中央中南局报告了周刚、焦光亮等人的全部罪恶活动，中南局纪律检查委员会用电报指示河南省委转告许昌地委进行检查时，许昌地委才积极派人到前郾城县委会进行检查，但因周刚、焦光亮坚持错误，狡猾抵赖，致使两次检查都未获得结果。一九五三年四月，河南省委纪律检查委员会协同中南局纪律检查委员会干部及许昌地委负责人共同前往郾城进行检查，这时，周刚、焦光亮的违法乱纪活动，已发展到登峰造极，和党完全处于对立的地位。检查组到达郾城以前，周刚（已调离工作）先得消息，即和焦光亮等几次商讨应付检查的办法。并互相约定“坚决不承认有报复行为，坚决斗争到底”。从四月十日到十六日，周刚就给焦光亮打了四次电话，让他“沉住气”，“要好好准备”。检查组在进行检查期间，焦光亮表面应付，背后却接连三次召开县委会议，和有关人员分头进行个别谈话，层层布置封锁，处处阻挠检查。并在干部中散布流言蜚语，说“检查组蛮横厉害”。更恶劣的事，是焦光亮竟烧毁证据，并对暴露真情的干部实行威胁利诱，为他保守秘密。最后，当事实真象被全部揭露之后，焦光亮又畏罪潜逃（后又返回），周刚则仍坚持错误，不作检讨。至此，他们便公开地背叛了党和人民，走上了绝路。
    根据河南省委纪律检查委员会关于王兆钧被陷害事件的检查报告来看，前郾城县委会已完全为资产阶级个人主义和自由主义所腐蚀，丧失了党组织的作用。为严肃党纪，河南省委已决定撤销该县委会机关，重新组织新的县委会；并将周刚、焦光亮、任学恕、牛培法等人开除出党，对其他有关人员也已根据其错误轻重，分别给以撤销工作、警告、劝告等处分。许昌地委书记纪登奎、副书记赵天锡、地委纪律检查委员会副书记刘坪，均受到当众警告处分。王兆钧因检举违法乱纪分子遭到打击陷害是冤枉的，许昌地委已恢复他的党籍。
