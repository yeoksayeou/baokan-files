    The Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Region in Yunnan Province was officially established on August 23rd. This is another ethnic autonomous region at the prefectural level established on the Yunnan border, following the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region, the Dehong Dai-Jingpo Autonomous Region, and the Honghe Hani Autonomous Region.
    This autonomous region governs four counties: Gongshan, Fugong, Bijiang, and Lushui. The Biluo Snow Mountain and Gaoligong Mountain run vertically through the territory, with the Nujiang River and Dulong River flowing between them, forming a high mountain and canyon area of about one thousand miles long. On the land on both sides of the rivers, crops such as corn, rice, beans, and wheat are produced. The mountains are covered with dense primitive forests, and rich mineral resources are hidden. In these high mountains and forests, a large amount of raw lacquer, Coptis chinensis, fritillaria, and other industrial raw materials and medicinal materials, as well as wild animals such as tigers, leopards, bears, and wild cattle are also produced.
    Within the autonomous region, about 120,000 people from twelve ethnic groups, including the Lisu, Nu, Tibetan, Yi, and Dulong, live together. The Lisu ethnic group accounts for 75% of the total population of the region. During the Kuomintang rule, people of all ethnic groups suffered cruel trampling by imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and were massacred more than ten times. Only after liberation did the people of all ethnic groups obtain equal rights. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Bijiang, Fugong, and Gongshan counties established the Lisu Autonomous Region People's Government in 1951. Other ethnic groups with smaller populations, such as the Nu, Tibetan, Dulong, and Yi, also established their own district and township-level political powers. In the political organs at all levels, 439 local ethnic minority cadres have been trained. Among them, 55 have served as county heads, section chiefs, and district heads. In addition, many young people are studying at ethnic minority colleges or specialized schools in Beijing, Kunming, and Lijiang.
    With the strong help of the higher-level people's government, the face of the Nujiang area has gradually changed. The Yunnan Provincial People's Government has successively allocated transportation construction funds, opened up all-weather post roads on the Biluo Snow Mountain, built iron cable bridges to replace bamboo ropeways over the turbulent Lancang River, and the main road in the Nujiang River Valley is also being built in a planned way. With the improvement of transportation conditions, people of all ethnic groups have received a large amount of materials. From last year to now, more than 6 million jin of goods have been transported from Shanghai, Kunming and other places. In the past, farmers of all ethnic groups mainly used slash-and-burn cultivation, and mostly used wooden farm tools. After liberation, the people's government loaned a large amount of food, seeds, and focused on supplying iron farm tools. In the past two years alone, more than 30,000 pieces of production tools such as hoes, plowshares, and sickles have been distributed. After the farmers of all ethnic groups obtained iron farm tools, their labor efficiency was greatly improved. The area of ​​slash-and-burn land is gradually decreasing, and the area of ​​terraces and cultivated land is increasing day by day. Farmers of all ethnic groups have gradually learned inter-tillage, fertilization, and promoted the planting of spring crops, and their grain income has increased year by year. Last year, the region increased grain production by more than 9 million jin, and this year's corn and rice are growing better than last year. With the support of state-owned trading companies, the local and special products of all ethnic groups have also developed significantly. The output of Coptis chinensis in Fugong County and the output of fritillaria in Gongshan County have exceeded the highest output before liberation; the income of the people of all ethnic groups has greatly increased, and their purchasing power has increased. In the first half of this year, the total value of goods supplied by state-owned trading companies in Bijiang and Fugong counties to the people of all ethnic groups has exceeded twenty times that of 1951.
    All counties in the autonomous region have now established health centers, and the number of people receiving free treatment has reached more than 240,000. There are now 74 primary schools in the region, and the number of children receiving education has increased seven times compared with before liberation. The cultural departments of Yunnan Province have also sent mobile film projection teams to the people of all ethnic groups, and radio stations have been established in various counties. Construction news from all over the motherland constantly inspires the people of all ethnic groups to advance victoriously.

    怒江傈僳族自治区介绍
    新华社记者  李松青、李朝阳
    云南省怒江傈僳族自治区在八月二十三日正式建立了。这是云南边疆成立了西双版纳傣族自治区、德宏傣族景颇族自治区和红河哈尼族自治区以后，又建立的一个相当于专区级的民族自治区。
    这个自治区辖贡山、福贡、碧江和泸水四个县。碧罗雪山、高黎贡山纵列境内，怒江和毒龙河奔流其间，形成长约一千里的高山峡谷地带。江河两面的土地上，出产玉米、水稻、豆、麦等作物，山中遍布着遮天蔽日的原始森林，蕴藏着丰富的矿产。在这些高山丛林里，还出产大量的生漆、黄连、贝母等工业原料和药材，虎、豹、熊和野牛等野兽。
    自治区境内，聚居着傈僳、怒、藏、彝、独龙等十二个民族，共约十二万人。傈僳族占全区人口的百分之七十五。在国民党统治时期，各族人民遭受帝国主义和国民党反动派的残酷蹂躏，先后被屠杀十多次。直到解放以后各族人民才得到了平等的权利。在中国共产党领导下，碧江、福贡、贡山三县在一九五一年分别成立了傈僳族自治区人民政府。其他人口较少的怒族、藏族、独龙族、彝族等也相继建立了本民族的区、乡级政权。在各级政权机关中，已培养了本地的各民族干部四百三十九人。其中有五十五人担任了县长、科长和区长等职务。此外，还有许多青年正在北京、昆明和丽江等地的民族学院或专业学校中学习。
    在上级人民政府的大力帮助下，怒江地区的面貌已逐渐改变。云南省人民政府先后拨发交通建设费，在碧罗雪山上，开辟了四季通行的驿道；在怒涛汹涌的澜沧江上，修建了铁索桥代替竹溜索；怒江河谷的大道，也正在有计划地进行修建。随着交通情况的改善，各族人民得到了大量的物资。从去年到现在，自上海、昆明等地运来的货物就有六百多万斤。过去，各族农民以刀耕火种为主要生产方式，多数使用木制的农具。解放后，人民政府贷放了大量的口粮、籽种，并着重供应了铁制的农具。仅在最近两年就发放了锄头、犁头和镰刀等生产工具三万多件。各族农民得到铁制的农具后，劳动效率大大提高。刀耕火种地的面积正逐渐缩小，梯田和熟地的面积日渐扩大。各族农民并逐步学会了中耕、施肥，推广种植了小春作物，粮食收入逐年增加。去年，全区就增产九百多万斤粮食，今年的玉米、水稻比去年还长得好。在国营贸易公司的扶植下，各族人民的土产、特产也有了显著发展。福贡县出产的黄连，贡山县出产的贝母，都超过了解放前的最高产量；各族人民的收入大大增加，购买力上升。碧江、福贡两县的国营贸易公司，今年上半年供应各族人民的货物总值已超过一九五一年的二十倍。
    自治区各县现在都设立了卫生院，得到免费治疗的人数，已达二十四万多人次。全区已有七十四所小学，受教育的儿童比解放前增加了七倍。云南省文化部门并为各族人民派来了巡回电影队，各县还设立了收音站，来自祖国各地的建设消息，时刻鼓舞着各族人民胜利前进。
