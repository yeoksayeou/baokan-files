    Jingjiang Flood Control and Diversion Hero Model Representative Conference
    All Representatives Report to the Central People's Government the Victory Message of Overcoming the Flood
    The entire body of representatives at the Jingjiang Flood Control and Diversion Hero Model Representative Conference convened by the Jingjiang Flood Control and Diversion Headquarters sent a telegram to the Central People's Government reporting the victory message of overcoming the largest flood in a century. The text of the telegram is as follows:

    Central People's Government:
    We report to you with extreme excitement the victory message of overcoming the flood. The Jingjiang Dike has been threatened by high flood levels since the beginning of July, lasting for more than two months. The water level in some dike sections exceeded the highest historical water level by more than one meter, and the situation was extremely serious. Special dangers occurred at Niejiadi Estuary, Sunjiaping Wall, Qing'an, and Ershengzhou on the Jingjiang Dike. The southern line of the embankment was subjected to the impact of storms, heavy rains, and huge waves. The 146-kilometer dike section in Jianli generally overflowed, and the dike body was in danger of collapsing. However, under your wise leadership and kind concern, we mobilized an army of 200,000 flood fighters along both sides of the river to engage in tenacious and indomitable struggle against the flood day and night. We overcame the largest flood in the recorded history of the Yangtze River, and finally kept the southern line of the Jingjiang Dike intact, powerfully safeguarding the safety of the lives and property of the industrial city of Wuhan and millions of people in the Hunan and Hubei regions. When we convened the hero model representative conference to summarize the victory, everyone unanimously agreed that our ability to achieve such a great victory was inseparable from your correct leadership and kind concern, the strong support of the people of the whole country, and the application of the great Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project. Therefore, we, the entire body of representatives attending the hero model representative conference, on behalf of the 200,000 flood fighters, extend our highest respect to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao. At present, the flood has not yet receded. We guarantee that we will never be arrogant or complacent because of victory. We are maintaining a hundredfold vigilance, bringing into play the spirit of the previous stage of flood control struggle, and using our existing experience to make persistent efforts and never stop fighting until complete victory is achieved. All of our representatives unanimously support the "Joint Declaration of the Democratic Parties and People's Organizations of the People's Republic of China for the Liberation of Taiwan" and are determined to support the liberation of Taiwan with practical actions of perfectly completing flood control work, production for disaster relief, dike closure, annual repairs, and rapidly restoring agricultural production, and over-fulfilling grain production.
    The Entire Body of Representatives of the Jingjiang Flood Control and Diversion Hero Model Representative Conference

    荆江防汛分洪英雄模范代表大会
    全体代表向中央人民政府报告战胜洪水的胜利消息
    荆江防汛分洪指挥部召开的荆江防汛分洪英雄模范代表大会全体代表，致电中央人民政府报告战胜百年以来大洪水的胜利消息。电文如下：中央人民政府：
    我们以万分兴奋的心情向您们报告战胜洪水的胜利消息。荆江大堤从七月初以来就受到高洪水位的威胁，时间长达两个多月。有的堤段的水位超过历年最高水位一公尺多，情况非常严重。荆江大堤聂家堤口孙家屏墙青安二圣洲等处发生特险，南线围堤受到暴风暴雨和巨浪的冲击，监利一四六公里堤段普遍漫水，堤身有漫溃的危险。但在您们的英明领导和亲切关怀下，我们动员了沿江两岸二十万防汛大军，夜以继日地和洪水进行坚韧顽强的斗争，战胜了长江有水文纪录以来未有的最大洪水，终于使荆江大堤南线围堤屹立无恙，有力地捍卫了武汉工业城市以及两湖地区千百万人民生命财产的安全。当我们在召开英雄模范代表大会总结胜利时，大家一致认为我们能够取得这样巨大的胜利，是和您们的正确领导与亲切关怀以及全国人民的大力支援并运用伟大的荆江分洪工程分不开的。因此，我们出席英雄模范代表大会的全体代表并代表二十万防汛大军向中共中央、中央人民政府和毛主席致以崇高的敬礼。当前洪水还没有退落，我们保证决不因胜利而骄傲自满，我们正百倍警惕地发挥前一阶段防汛斗争的精神和运用已有的经验，再接再厉，不获全胜决不收兵。我们全体代表一致拥护“中华人民共和国各民主党派各人民团体为解放台湾联合宣言”，决心以完满地做好防汛工作和生产救灾、堵口、岁修工作，迅速恢复农业生产，超额增产粮食的实际行动，来支援解放台湾。
