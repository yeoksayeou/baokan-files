The nationwide discussion on the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China has lasted nearly three months and is now concluded. In many areas, the number of people who listened to reports and participated in discussions reached more than 70% of the local adult population, and in some cities and individual special districts, it even exceeded 90%. At the same time, people's congresses were also generally convened at the provincial, municipal, county, and some township levels throughout the country, with the discussion of the Draft Constitution as one of the main contents of the meetings. After the meetings, the representatives also actively participated in the publicity activities for the Draft Constitution.

The people of the whole country put forward a total of 1,180,420 opinions and questions for revision and supplementation of the Draft Constitution. These opinions for revision and supplementation have been submitted to the Drafting Committee of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. Examples of these opinions include: In the last paragraph of the Preamble, the phrase "the principle of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty" was suggested to be changed to "the principle of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity." In Article 3, Paragraph 3, "all nationalities have the freedom to develop their own spoken and written languages" should be supplemented with the freedom to use them. In Article 23, Paragraph 1, the words "minority nationalities" could be removed and the words "autonomous regions" added, because the representatives of minority nationalities to the National People's Congress are not elected as a unit. In Paragraph 2, after "the number of representatives to the National People's Congress and the method of their election," add the sentence "including the number of representatives of minority nationalities and the method of their election." Article 24, Paragraph 2 stipulates that the election of representatives to the next National People's Congress shall be completed one month before the expiration of the term of the current National People's Congress. One month is too rushed. It is suggested that the time be extended. In the same paragraph, "until the next National People's Congress is elected" is suggested to be changed to "until the first session of the next National People's Congress is held," because after the next National People's Congress is elected, it cannot actually exercise its powers until its first session is held. Regarding the provisions on the people's courts, the Draft Constitution uses "People's Court" in some places and "Court" in others. These should be unified and all referred to as People's Court. In Article 31, item 6 of the functions and powers exercised by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, "annulling resolutions and orders of the State Council and lower-level people's congresses that conflict with the Constitution, laws, and decrees," includes people's congresses at all levels from the township to the province, which is too broad and should be specifically defined, that is, "lower-level people's congresses" should be changed to "state power organs of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government." The "lower level" in Article 60, Paragraph 4, the "lower level" in Article 65, Paragraph 2, and the "higher level" in Article 66 should also be changed accordingly to "next level" or "previous level." Many of the opinions raised in the discussions in various places are technical and repetitive, but the leading organs have paid full attention to all these opinions.

The nationwide discussion on the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China has further enhanced the socialist and patriotic consciousness of the people of the whole country and has powerfully promoted production and construction and various tasks. The people in various places expressed their enthusiastic support for the Draft Constitution and stated that after the Constitution is officially promulgated, they will strictly abide by the Constitution and laws, conscientiously fulfill their due obligations as citizens, and actively participate in the great cause of socialist construction.

### 宪法草案的全民讨论结束

    宪法草案的全民讨论结束
   【本报讯】中华人民共和国宪法草案的全民讨论历时近三个月，现在已经结束。许多地区听报告和参加讨论的人数都达到了当地成年人口的百分之七十以上，有些城市和个别的专区并达到了百分之九十以上。与此同时，全国各省、市、县和部分乡还普遍召开了人民代表大会会议，以宪法草案的讨论为会议主要内容之一。会后，代表们也都积极地参加了宪法草案的宣传活动。
    全国人民对宪法草案共提出了一百一十八万零四百二十条修改和补充的意见和问题。这些修改和补充的意见，已经先后汇交中华人民共和国宪法起草委员会。这些意见如：序言最后一段中的“互相尊重领土主权的原则”建议改为“互相尊重主权和领土完整的原则”。第三条第三款中“各民族都有发展自己的语言文字的自由”，应该添上也有使用的自由。第二十三条第一款中可把“少数民族”四字去掉，增加“自治区”三字。因为全国人民代表大会的少数民族的代表并不是作为一个单位选出的。第二款在“全国人民代表大会代表名额和代表产生办法”之下，增加“包括少数民族代表的名额和产生办法”一句。第二十四条第二款规定全国人民代表大会任期届满的一个月以前，完成下届全国人民代表大会代表的选举，一个月的时间太仓促了，建议把时间改得长些。同款中“到下届全国人民代表大会选出为止。”建议改为“到下届全国人民代表大会举行第一次会议为止。”因为下届全国人民代表大会选出后，在未举行第一次会议之前，实际上还不能行使权力。关于人民法院的规定，宪法草案中有的地方用“人民法院”，有的地方用“法院”，应统一起来，一律用人民法院。第三十一条全国人民代表大会常务委员会行使的职权中第六项“撤销国务院和下级人民代表大会同宪法、法律和法令相抵触的决议和命令”，中的“下级人民代表大会”包括从乡到省的各级人民代表大会，范围太广，应作具体规定，即把“下级人民代表大会”改为“省、自治区、直辖市国家权力机关”。第六十条第四款中的“下级”，第六十五条第二款中的“下级”，第六十六条中的“上级”也应相应地改为“下一级”或“上一级”。各地在讨论中提出的意见，有许多是属于技术性的和重复的，但领导机关对于所有这些意见都加以充分的重视。
    中华人民共和国宪法草案的全民讨论，进一步提高了全国人民社会主义和爱国主义的觉悟，并有力地推动了生产建设和各项工作。各地人民表示热烈地拥护宪法草案，并表示在宪法正式公布后，要严格遵守宪法和法律，认真履行公民应尽的义务，积极参加社会主义的伟大建设事业。
