Xinhua News Agency, September 9th: New York dispatch: The outgoing Indian Representative to the United Nations, Dayal, said at a luncheon held for him by the United Nations Correspondents Association on the 8th that the past three or four sessions of the United Nations General Assembly have been "not very encouraging," "one of the reasons being that many of the United Nations' problems are related to Asia, and without the participation of Asia's largest country, it is impossible to have a serious discussion of these problems." Dayal said that if the People's Republic of China participated, although not all problems would be solved, at least the discussions would be more realistic.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 9th: The Canadian "Tribune" reported on the 6th that the Canadian Peace Congress is launching a "Strive for Peace, Strive for Immediate Recognition of China" campaign.

According to the "Tribune," the Executive Committee of the Canadian Peace Congress recently held an expanded meeting in Toronto, chaired by Dr. Wen Youzhang. The meeting passed a letter to the Canadian government, requesting the Canadian government to "formally recognize the government of the 600 million Chinese people diplomatically." Bruce Mickleburgh, Public Relations Director of the Congress, said at the meeting that the Peace Committees throughout Canada "will host public gatherings, distribute leaflets and promotional materials, and hold radio broadcasts. We call on all those who advocate recognition of China and peace to contribute their strength to make this movement a success."

    加拿大发动“争取和平、争取立即承认中国”运动
    【新华社九日讯】纽约消息：即将去职返国的印度驻联合国代表达雅尔，八日在联合国记者协会为他举行的午餐会上说，过去三、四届联合国大会是“不太令人鼓舞的”，“其原因之一就是：联合国的许多问题是同亚洲有关的，而没有亚洲最大的国家参加，就不可能对这些问题进行认真的讨论”。达雅尔说，如果有中华人民共和国参加，虽然不是一切问题都将得到解决，至少会议的讨论将会更现实一些。
    【新华社柏林九日电】加拿大“论坛报”六日报道：加拿大和平大会正在发动“争取和平、争取立即承认中国”的运动。
    据“论坛报”报道，加拿大和平大会执行委员会最近在多伦多举行扩大会议，由文幼章博士任会议主席。会上通过了致加拿大政府书，要求加拿大政府“正式在外交上承认六亿中国人民的政府”。大会公共关系部长布鲁斯·密克尔堡在会上说：加拿大各地的和平委员会“将主持公共集会，散发传单与宣传品，并举行无线电广播。我们要求所有主张承认中国、主张和平的人拿出力量来使这个运动胜利”。
