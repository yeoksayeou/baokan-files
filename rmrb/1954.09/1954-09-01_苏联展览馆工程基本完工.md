    Soviet Exhibition Center Project Basically Completed
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Soviet Exhibition Center being built in the capital is now basically completed.
    The workers who built the Industry Pavilion, Culture Pavilion, and Agriculture Pavilion of the Soviet Exhibition Center victoriously completed all the projects in a short period of eight or nine months and handed them over in mid-July and mid-August respectively. Now only scattered finishing works remain, and the workers are rushing to complete them. In the Culture Pavilion, there is a wooden-roofed house with the traditional Russian folk architectural art style, and workers from the Wang Zhiping carpentry carving team are carving the patterns on the wooden pillars. They said: These patterns are completely in the Soviet style, and we must carefully and meticulously carve out their characteristics.
    The scaffolding outside the central hub of the entire hall—the Central Hall—has been removed, and the gilded iron tower, which was completed long ago, reveals its majestic appearance even more. Workers are painting the walls inside and installing chandeliers. Paint workers are repairing the red gate, some are busy spraying red enamel paint, and some are installing copper flowers. Outside the Central Hall, some workers are making bush-hammered stone for the wall base, and some are working on the ground. They are unanimously striving to hand over the project on September 2nd. The painting work on the stage and dressing rooms of the open-air theater has been completed. Now the workers are making the ground and the steps of the flower beds on both sides of the outer arc. The roof railings and flagpoles are almost installed. During the project, the workers launched competitions with each other. The electrical youth shock brigade overfulfilled its task by 607% in the wiring project in the basement of the Industry Pavilion. The cinema, the restaurant, and the two lounges in the cinema and the Culture Pavilion were handed over at the end of August. Workers are painting the walls around the cinema stage and repairing the inside of the stage. Workers newly arrived from Tianjin to provide support are painting the column heads and decorating the roof ornaments in the restaurant. Electrical workers are installing electrical equipment in the kitchen.
    The auxiliary projects of the Soviet Exhibition Center, such as office buildings, canteens, warehouses, and dormitories, are now nearing completion. The workers who built the office building and canteen are striving to hand over the project on September 2nd. The workers who built the warehouses and dormitories are also actively working hard.
    In terms of the gardens, the east and west squares on both sides of the Industry Pavilion have been completed. In the large garden in front of the Central Hall, the workers' work has been very intense in recent days. Some are making terrazzo around the fountain, and some are laying cement pavement. Many precious flowers and plants are planted in the large flower beds on the left and right sides of the fountain. The seeds of the turf planted on the lawns on both sides of the flower beds are called "prairie oat grass," which was transported from Moscow from afar. It can maintain a dark green color in early spring and late autumn. Some workers are laying the roads on the east and west sides of the exhibition hall and around the open-air theater. Dozens of trucks are constantly transporting stones and sand.
    It is estimated that the entire project will be completed in September.

    【本报讯】在首都兴建的苏联展览馆，现在已基本完工。
    建筑苏联展览馆的工业馆、文化馆、农业馆的工人，在短短的八九个月的期间内，胜利地完成了全部工程，已于七月中旬、八月中旬先后交工。现在只剩下零星的修饰工程，工人们正在赶工。文化馆内有一间具有俄罗斯民间建筑艺术传统的木顶房子，现正由王志平木工雕刻小组的工人雕刻木柱的花纹。他们说：这些花样完全是苏联的形式，我们一定要细心地、一点一点地雕刻出它的特点来。
    全馆的中心枢纽——中央大厅外面的脚手架已经拆除，早已完工的镏金铁塔，更加显现出它雄伟的全貌。工人们正在内部粉刷墙壁，安装吊灯。油漆工人正在修饰红大门，有的在忙着喷红磁漆，有的在安铜花。在中央大厅的外部，有的工人在做墙壁底座的剁斧石，有的在做地面。他们一致争取在九月二日交工。露天剧场的舞台和化妆室粉刷工程已经完成了。现在工人们正做地面及两边外圆弧的花坛踏步。屋顶栏杆、旗杆已经快安好了。在工程中，工人们互相展开了竞赛，电气青年突击队在工业馆地下室穿线工程中，超额百分之六百零七完成了任务。电影院、餐厅及电影院、文化馆里的两个休息室，已在八月底交工。工人们正在粉刷电影院舞台周围的墙壁，修建舞台内部。新从天津前来支援的工人们，正在餐厅粉刷柱头，修饰屋顶花饰。电气工人在厨房安装电气设备。
    苏联展览馆的附属工程，如办公楼、食堂、仓库、宿舍等工程，现在已接近完工。修建办公楼及食堂的工人争取在九月二日交工。修建仓库和宿舍的工人，也在积极赶工。
    在庭园方面，工业馆两边的东西广场已经完工了。中央大厅前边的大庭园里，近几天来工人们的工作十分紧张。有的正在做喷水池边的水磨石，有的在铺水泥路面。喷水池左右两侧大花坪中种植有很多珍贵的花草。花坪两旁的草坪上所种的草皮的种籽叫做草原燕麦，是由莫斯科远道运来的，它在初春、深秋季节，都可保持深绿的颜色。一部分工人正在铺设展览馆东西两侧和露天剧场周围的马路，十几辆汽车在川流不息地运送石子和沙土。
