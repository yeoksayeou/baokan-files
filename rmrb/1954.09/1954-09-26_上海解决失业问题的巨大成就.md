The great achievement of Shanghai in solving unemployment

National People's Congress Representative, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, Zhang Qi

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, in just five years, the unemployment problem in Shanghai has been basically solved. Now, the phenomenon of unemployment is not only greatly reduced in degree compared to the past, but also essentially different from before: the workers who were unemployed before liberation have now basically found jobs, and the current unemployed are mostly workers who lack labor and skills, and housewives who are seeking employment.

Since 1921, Shanghai workers, in order to survive and protect their jobs, have been fighting unyieldingly against the reactionary rulers under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. As early as February 1925, in order to oppose the Japanese imperialists' abuse and dismissal of workers, 40,000 workers in Shanghai Japanese-owned textile factories held a general strike. This strike became the prelude to the "May 30th" Movement. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang reactionaries attempted to delay the start of work in order to take the opportunity to steal and sell factory machines and raw materials, destroy factory production, and allow a large amount of surplus US goods to be dumped in our country. Shanghai workers, mainly textile workers and machinery workers, gathered in Pingmin Village in Huxi and Pingliang Village in Hudong to hold petition parades demanding resumption of work, exposing the conspiracy of the Kuomintang reactionaries. The reactionary rulers then sent military police and secret agents to beat and arrest workers in an attempt to suppress the workers' struggle. But the workers did not yield, and finally won the victory of resumption of work. This was a relatively large-scale struggle, and there were dozens or even hundreds of smaller-scale struggles every year. In the year after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, there were 425 struggles by workers against dismissal and demanding resumption of work.

Although the struggles at that time also achieved certain victories, because the regime was in the hands of the imperialists, feudalists, and bureaucratic capitalists who created unemployment every day, the jobs and lives of the workers were not guaranteed at all: factories and shops closed down and people became unemployed, people became unemployed when they got old, sick, or injured at work, women workers became unemployed when they became pregnant, and people became unemployed if they did not pay tribute to local ruffians and feudal foremen on time. Originally, the workers lived on six-grain flour and bean dregs, and when they became unemployed, they couldn't even eat these. Many workers were reduced to begging on the streets. In addition, semi-unemployment was even more common. The jobs of many workers were extremely unstable. There was "work" to do in the peak season, but they became unemployed in the off-season. They couldn't work even three or four days a week, and their wages were discounted by 20% or 30%. Coupled with inflation, their actual income couldn't even support themselves, and their families had to suffer from cold and hunger. On the eve of liberation, tens of thousands of worker families in Shanghai lived on rotten sweet potatoes and vegetable peels.

In 1949, after the liberation of Shanghai, we ended our long period of oppression and enslavement.

The jobs of employed workers are guaranteed. The "Trade Union Law of the People's Republic of China" specifically stipulates that the administrative side or capitalists of industrial and mining enterprises, shops, farms, institutions, schools, etc., shall not violate the laws and regulations of the People's Government or collective contracts to dismiss workers. The "Labor Insurance Regulations of the People's Republic of China" also stipulate insurance measures for "birth, old age, illness, death, injury, and disability." Even if some factories and industries have temporary difficulties and temporarily suspend work or do not start work sufficiently, workers will not become unemployed as a result. For example, when the yarn factories stopped work for a month in the summer of 1951 due to insufficient raw cotton, the workers organized study while still receiving wages. The workers said: "Only because of the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, can we study and still get paid. If we had not been liberated, our rice pots would have been hung up long ago."

The Party and the government are most concerned about unemployed workers. In his report to the Third Plenary Session of the Party on June 6, 1950, Chairman Mao instructed us: "We must earnestly carry out relief work for unemployed workers and unemployed intellectuals, and help the unemployed find employment in a step-by-step manner..." and listed this work as one of the important tasks of "striving for a fundamental turn for the better in the country's financial and economic situation." On June 17, 1950, the State Council of the Central People's Government also issued instructions on relieving unemployed workers. Employed workers and commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army across the country also supported unemployed workers in Shanghai. Workers in Northeast China alone donated more than 8.36 billion yuan in one go. The Shanghai Municipal People's Government, the East China and Shanghai Production and Disaster Relief Committee also allocated a total of more than 100 billion yuan worth of materials to relieve unemployed workers. On August 1, 1952, the State Council promulgated the "Decision on Labor Employment Issues," instructing people's governments at all levels to conduct comprehensive and unified registration of unemployed personnel, and to handle them separately according to different circumstances after registration.

The Shanghai Municipal People's Government and trade union organizations, in accordance with the instructions of the State Council, on the one hand, actively carried out labor employment work (including job placement and encouraging self-employment), and on the other hand, took measures such as organizing study, work relief, retraining, and production self-rescue to alleviate the suffering of unemployed workers and improve the employment conditions of some unemployed people.

From May 1950 to June 1954, in the four years, more than 271,000 unemployed people have been employed for a long time or resettled through the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau or by completing registration procedures. Many long-term unemployed workers have found jobs. For example, Han Linsheng, a worker at Liangong Machinery Factory, had been unemployed for six years, and his father was originally a patternmaker who had been unemployed for twelve years. In 1952, he was introduced by the government to Liangong Machinery Factory to learn technology, and has now become a formal fitter. His father was also assigned to work for the North China Capital Construction Company in the same year. He said with emotion: "Old China made me unemployed, and new China gave me a job. I understand that as long as the motherland has a future, we unemployed workers also have a future."

From 1951 to December 1953, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau had successively trained more than 30,000 unemployed workers, including more than 6,000 unemployed young people who entered factories to learn technology. This year, in addition to preparing to successively recruit more than 3,000 unemployed people to study in hardware and machinery training classes, more than 1,000 unemployed young people will be organized to enter factories to learn technology successively. Many unemployed workers who had no culture and no skills in the past have now become skilled workers with technology and culture. Xi Xiaolin was a female sock factory worker who was unemployed before liberation. After liberation, under the care and cultivation of the People's Government, she learned planing machine technology and was assigned to the Shanghai Unemployed Workers Fourth Mechanical Training Class as an assistant teacher in 1952. Female worker Gu Lanfen was long-term unemployed at home before liberation. In 1951, she was introduced to the Second Mechanical Apprentice School to study. In just six months, she mastered lathe technology and is now a lathe worker at the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory.

For unemployed people who have not yet had the opportunity to obtain employment and retraining (they are not skilled workers and skilled workers; it is still impossible to find skilled workers and skilled workers now!), in addition to continuing to provide relief, the People's Government has also vigorously organized and assisted them in carrying out handicraft production. Last year alone, the People's Government helped nearly 1,000 unemployed workers organize more than 30 production self-rescue workshops for clothing, velvet cutting, etc. Commercial departments also processed orders for these workshops. Thirteen workshops have officially transformed into handicraft production cooperatives due to production development and mature conditions.

With the gradual recovery and continuous development of industry, the number of people employed is constantly increasing. In the past five years, in addition to being introduced to employment by the Labor Bureau, many unemployed workers have found employment without being introduced by the Labor Bureau. This can be seen from the growth of the total number of employees in Shanghai (although some of them graduated from schools). According to the statistics in January 1951, the total number of employees in Shanghai was 932,000, including 460,000 workers in factories; according to the statistics at the end of 1953, it was 1,442,000, including 770,000 workers in factories.

Because the unemployment disaster left over from old Shanghai was too heavy, because my country is just carrying out planned economic construction, and because capitalist industry and commerce are still in the process of socialist transformation, it is impossible to completely eliminate the phenomenon of unemployment in the short term. However, our country, which is advancing towards socialism, will, as written in Article 91 of the Constitution, gradually expand labor employment and improve labor conditions and wage treatment through the planned development of the national economy to guarantee citizens' right to work. Therefore, we believe that the phenomenon of unemployment left over from old China will definitely be gradually and completely resolved.

    上海解决失业问题的巨大成就
    全国人民代表大会代表 上海市工会联合会副主席  张祺
    中华人民共和国成立以来，只有五年功夫，上海市的失业问题已经基本上接近解决了。现在，失业现象不仅在程度上比过去大大减轻了，而且在本质上跟以前也不一样了：在解放前失业的工人现在基本上都得到了职业，现在的失业者大都是缺乏劳动力的和没有技术的工人，是要求就业的家庭妇女。
    上海职工为了生存，为了保障职业，自一九二一年以后，一直在中国共产党的领导下，跟反动统治者进行着不屈的斗争。远在一九二五年二月，为了反对日本帝国主义虐待和开除工人，上海日商纱厂四万工人举行了大罢工。这次罢工成为“五卅”运动的前导。抗日战争胜利以后，国民党反动派企图拖延开工，以便乘机盗卖工厂机器原料，破坏工厂生产，使美国剩余物资能大量在我国倾销。以纺织业工人和机器业工人为主的上海职工，曾先后在沪西平民村和沪东平凉村集合起来，举行要求复工的请愿游行，揭穿国民党反动派的阴谋。反动统治者当时派宪兵、军警特务来殴打职工，逮捕职工，企图把工人的斗争镇压下去。但是工人没有屈服，最后取得了复工的胜利。这是比较大规模的斗争，至于小规模的斗争，每年总有几十起甚至数百起。抗日战争胜利后的一年中，职工为反对解雇、要求复工的斗争，即达四百二十五次。
    当时的斗争，虽然也获得了一定的胜利，但是由于政权掌握在每天制造失业的帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义手里，职工的职业和生活并没有一点保障：工厂商店关门了要失业，年纪大了、病了、因工伤残了要失业，女工怀孕了要失业，不按时按节孝敬地痞流氓、封建把头也要失业。原来职工们过的就是吃六谷粉、豆渣皮的日子，一失业连这些也吃不着了。许多职工流落街头“讨饭”度日。此外，半失业现象更为普遍，许多职工的职业极不固定，旺季有“活”做，淡季就失业，一星期上不了三四天工，工资七折八扣，加上通货膨胀，实际收入连自己还养不活，一家老小只有受冻受饿。在解放前夕，上海有上万个工人的家庭是吃烂山芋、菜皮过日子的。
    一九四九年，上海解放后，我们结束了长时期被压迫、被奴役的生活。
    在业工人的职业有了保障。“中华人民共和国工会法”具体规定，工矿企业、商店、农场、机关、学校等的行政方面或资本家，不得违反人民政府法令或集体合同来解雇职工。“中华人民共和国劳动保险条例”又规定了对“生、老、病、死、伤、残”的保险办法。有些工厂、行业暂时发生困难，暂时停工或开工不足的时候，工人也不会因此失业的。像一九五一年夏季纱厂因原棉不足而停工一个月时，工人一面组织学习，一面还拿工钱。工人说：“只因为有了毛主席和共产党的领导，我们才有书读还有工钱拿。要不是解放了，我们的饭锅子早就吊起来了。”
    党和政府是最关心失业工人的。一九五○年六月六日毛主席在党的三中全会上所作的报告中，指示我们：“必须认真地进行对于失业工人和失业知识分子的救济工作，有步骤地帮助失业者就业。……”并且把这个工作列为“为争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转而斗争”的重要任务之一。一九五○年六月十七日中央人民政府政务院又发布了关于救济失业工人的指示。全国的在业工人和解放军指战员们也支援上海失业工人，仅东北工人一次就捐献了八十三亿六千多万元。上海市人民政府、华东及上海生产救灾委员会也先后共拨了一千多亿元物资来救济失业工人。一九五二年八月一日政务院又公布了关于劳动就业问题的决定，指示各级人民政府对失业人员进行全面统一的登记，登记以后，根据不同情况，分别处理。
    上海市人民政府和工会组织，按照政务院的指示，一方面积极进行了劳动就业（包括介绍就业和鼓励自动就业）工作，另一方面又采取了组织学习、以工代赈、转业训练、生产自救等措施，以减轻失业工人的痛苦和提高部分失业人员的就业条件。
    从一九五○年五月到一九五四年六月的四年里，通过上海市人民政府劳动局介绍或办理备案手续的已长期就业和得到安置的失业人员就有二十七万一千余人。很多长期失业的工人，得到了职业，如良工机器厂工人韩林生，他自己失业已经六年，他父亲原来是一个打样师，已经失业了十二年。一九五二年，他被政府介绍进良工机器厂学习技术，现在已经成为一个正式的钳工，他的父亲也在同年被分配到华北基本建设公司工作。他感动地说：
  “旧中国使我失业，新中国使我得到职业。我明白了，只要祖国有前途，我们失业工人也有前途。”
    从一九五一年到一九五三年十二月，上海市人民政府劳动局已陆续对三万多失业工人进行了训练，其中六千多名是进工厂学习技术的失业青年。今年除准备陆续吸收三千多名失业人员进五金机械训练班学习外，并将陆续组织一千多名失业青年进工厂学习技术。很多过去没有文化没有技术的失业工人，现在都已变成有技术、有文化的优秀的熟练工人了。奚小琳是一个解放前就失业的袜厂女工，解放后，在人民政府的关心与培养下，学会了刨床技术，一九五二年被分配到上海失业工人第四机械训练班当助理教师。女工顾兰芬，解放前长期失业在家里，一九五一年被介绍到第二机械艺徒学校学习，在短短的六个月里就掌握了车工技术，现在已经是上海机床厂的车工了。
    对于暂时还没有得到就业和转业训练机会的失业人员（都不是技术工人和熟练工人；现在找技术工人和熟练工人还找不到呢！）人民政府除继续进行救济外，又曾大力组织并协助他们进行手工业生产。去年一年，人民政府帮助了近千名失业工人组织了服装、割绒等三十多个生产自救工场。商业部门也向这些工场加工订货。有十三个工场，因为生产发展和条件成熟，已经正式转为手工业生产合作社了。
    随着工业的逐渐恢复和不断发展，劳动就业人数在不断增加。五年来，失业工人除了由劳动局介绍就业以外，还有不少人是没经过劳动局介绍而就业的。这一点，可以从上海市的职工总人数的增长情况看出来（虽然有部分是从学校里毕业出来的）。上海职工总人数，据一九五一年一月的统计，是九十三万二千人，其中工厂中的工人为四十六万人；
  一九五三年年底的统计，为一百四十四万二千人，其中工厂中的工人为七十七万人。
    由于旧上海遗留下来的失业灾害太沉重，由于我国刚刚进行有计划的经济建设，由于资本主义工商业还处在社会主义改造过程中，所以还不可能在短期内完全消灭失业现象。但是，正在向着社会主义前进的我国，将像宪法第九十一条所写的那样，通过国民经济有计划的发展，逐步扩大劳动就业，改善劳动条件和工资待遇，来保证公民享受劳动的权利的。所以，我们相信，旧中国遗留下来的失业现象，一定能逐步得到彻底解决。
