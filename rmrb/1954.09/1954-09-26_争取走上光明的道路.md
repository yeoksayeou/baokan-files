    Strive to Embark on the Path of Light
    Xiang De, Representative of the National People's Congress, Chairman of Changsha Enterprise Company
    The industrialists and businessmen of Changsha have gradually clarified their understanding of the state capitalism policy. Initially, state capitalism was generally regarded as a simple cooperation or partnership between private and state capital, and it was believed that the only form of state capitalism was joint state-private ownership. Small and medium-sized enterprises generally felt that their enterprises were too small, especially commercial households, who felt that there were too few forms of state capitalism, worried that there was no way to embark on it, and were therefore anxious. Later, they initially learned that the state capitalist economy is an economy in which socialist components are linked and cooperated with capitalist components under the direct leadership of the socialist economy, and that there are many forms of state capitalism. Industry can take the road of state capitalism, and commerce can also take it; large households can take it, and small and medium-sized households can also take it. However, they also felt that this economy mainly produced and operated for the needs of the country and the people, and could not be as willful and profit-seeking as they had ideally wanted. Some industrialists and businessmen then developed resistance. Later, after learning and being educated by some practical examples, they began to correct their understanding, knowing that the state's pointing out of a bright road for private industrialists and businessmen was to gradually realize the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce through the road of state capitalism. After some advanced members of the business community had a correct understanding, they took active actions of loving the country, abiding by the law, and improving production and operation to strive to embark on the road of state capitalism. As of July of this year, the industrial sector has embarked on the road of state capitalism in the forms of purchase, sales, processing, ordering, and joint state-private ownership. Among the city's large industrial households, the production value of their state capitalist forms has accounted for 95.34 percent of their total production value. Those in the commercial sector who have embarked on the road of state capitalism have forms such as professional agency, purchasing, sales, distribution, (distribution of some commodities and professional distribution) wholesale and retail, joint purchase and distribution, and purchase with discounts. Except for general industries that are still individual stores embarking on the road of state capitalism, the rice business, international trade and other industries have all been transformed into state capitalist forms.
    The superiority of state capitalism can be fully seen from some practical examples in this city. Since the government implemented the unified purchase and sale of grain last year, Changsha's rice mills have all become the grain bureau's professional processing plants, and rice merchants have all become the grain bureau's professional distribution stores. The supply of grain to the people of the city has been guaranteed. Especially this year, when Hunan's lake area suffered a flood unseen in nearly a hundred years, grain production was reduced, but the grain supply was stable and there was no fluctuation. Everyone deeply felt the greatness and correctness of the Party and the People's Government's policies. Even those who run rice mills and distribute grain said from the bottom of their hearts: "If it were not for the Party and the People's Government implementing the unified purchase and sale of grain and banning grain speculation in the event of such a major flood this year, our rice merchants could have made a fortune, but many people would have starved to death. We are equivalent to getting fat by eating human flesh." Since March of this year, after some stores in the department store, silk and cloth, book, stationery, and paper industries began to sign wholesale and retail agreements with state-owned companies, a new atmosphere has emerged. The turnover of the agreement-signing households generally showed an increase. Taking the silk and cloth industry as an example, the turnover of the agreement-signing households in March increased by 29.2 percent compared with February (the turnover of other households that did not implement wholesale and retail only increased by 24.5 percent), and in April it increased by 17.94 percent compared with March (the turnover of other retail households only increased by 6.86 percent). Up to now, more commercial enterprises have embarked on various forms of state capitalism. Generally, they have improved their business management, established systems, corrected their business style, and saved expenses.
    Although the superiority of state capitalism is already obvious to all, the ideological understanding of many industrialists and businessmen is still inevitably lagging behind the development of the situation. After some factories and stores embark on the road of state capitalism, there are two types of performance. One is to only want to wear the cloak of state capitalism and still enter socialism "unchanged" in the old way of capitalism. The other is to think that after embarking on the road of state capitalism, they have already "bought a ticket" and "boarded the ship," and that production is handled by workers, management is the responsibility of the work group, etc., so they are "worry-free" and can "sit in a sedan chair" and let others carry them into socialism. What are the roots of these thoughts? In the final analysis, it is a reflection of the profit-seeking nature of the bourgeoisie, and everything is considered from the perspective of personal calculation and profit-seeking.
    Our private industrialists and businessmen should realize that embarking on the road of state capitalism for capitalist industry and commerce is the first step towards socialist transformation, gaining ample opportunities to contribute and develop their management talents or technology. Any thoughts of wanting to wear the cloak of state capitalism and take the old road of capitalism or passively "sitting in a sedan chair" are detrimental to the country and the individual.

    争取走上光明的道路
    全国人民代表大会代表 长沙企业公司董事长  向德
    长沙市工商业者对于国家资本主义的政策，是逐渐明确起来的。起先对于国家资本主义，普遍认为就是私人资本和国家资本的单纯合作或合伙，并且认为国家资本主义的形式就只是公私合营。一般中小企业感觉自己企业太小，特别是商业户，感觉国家资本主义形式太少，忧愁没有法子走得上，因此彷徨不安。后来初步知道了国家资本主义经济是社会主义经济直接领导下的社会主义成分同资本主义成分联系和合作的经济，国家资本主义的形式很多，国家资本主义的道路工业能走，商业也能走；大户能走，中小户也能走。但又感到这种经济，主要的是为国家和人民的需要而生产经营，不是如自己所理想那样的能为所欲为地唯利是图，有些工商业户就又产生抗拒思想。后来经过学习和受到若干实际事例的教育，开始端正了认识，知道资本主义工商业经过国家资本主义的道路逐步实现社会主义改造是国家为私营工商业者所指出的一条光明大道。工商界若干先进分子有了正确的认识以后，即以爱国守法，改善生产经营的积极行动，争取走上国家资本主义道路。到今年七月止，工业部分已走向国家资本主义道路者有收购、包销、加工、订货、公私合营等形式。全市大型工业户中，其国家资本主义形式的生产总值已占其全部生产总值百分之九十五点三四。商业部分走上国家资本主义道路者有专业代理、代购、代销、经销、（有部分商品的经销和专业经销）批购零销、联购分销、凭折购货等形式。除一般行业尚系个别店户走上国家资本主义道路外，米商业、国际贸易业等已全部转变为国家资本主义形式。
    国家资本主义的优越性，从本市若干实际事例上可以充分看出来。自从去年政府实行粮食统购统销以后，长沙的碾米厂即全业变为粮食局的专业加工厂，米商全业变为粮食局的专业代销店。全市人民对粮食的供应获得了保证。特别是今年湖南滨湖地区遭受近百年来未有的洪水，粮食减产，而粮食供应稳定，没有丝毫波动。人人都深深地感到党和人民政府政策的伟大和正确。就是做碾米厂和经销粮食的人也说出由衷的话：“今年发生这样大的洪水，假如不是党和人民政府实行了粮食统购统销和取缔粮食投机的办法，我们米商虽然可以大发横财，但不少的人都会要饿死，我们等于是吃人肉长胖的。”从今年三月起，百货、绸布、图书文教、纸商等业一部分商店开始向国营公司订立批购零销协议以后，即出现了新的气象。签订协议户一般营业额都表现上升。以绸布业为例，协议户三月份营业额比二月份上升百分之二十九点二（其余未实行批购零销户只上升百分之二十四点五），四月份比三月份又上升百分之十七点九四（其余零售户只上升百分之六点八六）。到现在，商业走上各种形式的国家资本主义的更多了。一般都改进了经营管理，订立了制度，端正了经营作风，节约了开支。
    国家资本主义的优越性虽然已是人所共见，但很多工商业者的思想认识还不免落后于形势的发展。若干厂店在走上国家资本主义道路以后，有两种表现。一种是只想披着国家资本主义的外衣，仍照资本主义的老一套做法“原封不动”地进入社会主义。一种是认为走上了国家资本主义道路以后已经“买到了船票”“搭上了船”，生产有工人搞，管理有工作组负责等等，自己“万事无忧”，可以“坐轿子”让人家抬着进社会主义去。这些思想根源是什么呢？归根到底，就是资产阶级唯利是图本质的反映，一切从个人打算、唯利是图的角度来考虑问题。
    我们私营工商业者应该认识，资本主义工商业走上了国家资本主义道路，即是走上了社会主义改造的第一步，获得充分贡献与发展其经营管理才能或技术的机会，任何想披着国家资本主义外衣走资本主义老路或消极“坐轿子”的思想都是于国家于个人不利的。
