Do a Good Job in Production and Disaster Relief in Disaster Areas
Lin Zhun

After several months of arduous struggle, the people in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and along the Huai River have basically overcome the floods unseen in a century. At present, the main task of Party committees and people's governments at all levels in the disaster areas is to lead the people to do a good job in production and disaster relief, quickly restore production, and rebuild their homes.

The flood prevention struggle and production and disaster relief work led by the Party and the government this year are unparalleled by any previous government. As a result of our arduous struggle, although the water level in Wuhan reached 29.73 meters, it still stood firm in the face of the flood, and cities such as Nanjing also resisted the flood. In the Huai River Basin, the vast plains were either spared from the disaster or had the disaster mitigated; the dikes of the Subei Canal also ensured safety, and tens of millions of mu of farmland in the Subei Plain were completely spared from the disaster. During the flood prevention and rescue stage, the state has already allocated more than 550 billion yuan for relief funds, 940 billion yuan for loans, and supplied more than 510 million jin of food grains and more than 200 million jin of various late autumn crop seeds. In order to help the people in the flooded areas to relocate to safe areas, the Party and the government have also carried out tremendous organizational work to enable the disaster victims to relocate in a planned and orderly manner; the masses in the resettlement areas have also carried forward a high degree of fraternal mutual assistance spirit, so that the disaster victims have been greatly facilitated in terms of life and production. Therefore, the people in the disaster areas are full of confidence in overcoming the disaster.

However, to lead the people in the disaster areas to finally overcome the disaster and tide over the famine is still a considerably long-term and arduous task.

Leading the people in the disaster areas to do a good job in agricultural production is the most fundamental way to tide over the famine as soon as possible. At present, most of the farmland in the disaster areas across the country has been drained of waterlogging. In addition to those that have been rescued and maintained a certain harvest, most of the farmland that needs to be replanted or converted has also been replanted or converted. Doing a good job in field management of these farmlands and increasing the harvest of these farmlands can solve most of the food problems for the people in the disaster areas this winter and next spring. At the same time, as the rivers recede, timely drainage of those farmlands that have not yet been dehydrated, and striving to sow wheat, barley, rapeseed, broad beans, peas and other crops in time for the agricultural season, is also of great significance for the people in the disaster areas to tide over the famine as soon as possible. In order to meet the needs of overcoming the famine, the disaster areas should also make full use of the winter fallow land and the land beside the fields, and grow various winter vegetables such as cabbage and mustard greens. As the saying goes, "With vegetables, you have half a year's grain; without vegetables, you have half a year's famine," and "With three loads of vegetables at home, you are not afraid of bad years." These are all valuable experiences of the masses in overcoming the famine. If these tasks are done well, there will be a basic guarantee to tide over the famine. The problem of raising draught cattle in the disaster areas has been temporarily solved by adopting methods such as foster care or collective grazing. However, all localities must make every effort to solve the problem of protecting draught cattle in the disaster areas to safely overwinter and preparing forage needed for draught cattle in the disaster areas to overwinter as soon as possible. Whether this problem is solved well or not is related to whether the spring plowing production in the disaster areas next year can be carried out smoothly and whether agricultural production can be rapidly restored and developed in the future.

Leading the people in the disaster areas to do a good job in sideline production, under the principle of not hindering agricultural production and being conducive to agricultural production, is also an effective way to tide over the famine. Last year, many areas seriously affected by floods did not experience severe spring famine this year, mainly due to the achievements in sideline production. Last winter, the people in the disaster areas of Hebei Province gained as much as 600 million jin of grain from sideline activities, which not only solved the difficulties during the famine period, but also used the sideline surplus to add agricultural tools, purchase draught cattle, and expand agricultural production. Some disaster areas this year have already started sideline production, such as Jiangpu County in Jiangsu Province, where seven severely affected townships have already started more than ten kinds of sideline production, such as fishing, weaving reed mats, weaving fishing nets, digging medicinal materials, and weaving bamboo baskets. Among them, fishing is expected to bring in 500,000 to 600,000 jin of fresh fish by the end of the year. This year's disaster areas generally have abundant production and many avenues for sideline production, especially the disaster areas along the rivers and lakes, where water-based sideline production has a certain foundation. This year, the water is high and there are many fish, so water-based production should be vigorously developed. In the work of organizing sideline production, the people's government should solve the difficulties of the disaster victims in engaging in sideline production. Banks and credit cooperative departments should provide assistance in loans and other aspects; commercial and supply and marketing cooperative departments should expand the purchase plan for the disaster areas, supply or loan disaster victims with production tools and raw materials, and at the same time, sign supply, production, and sales contracts with the disaster victims to ensure the planned nature of disaster victims' production, so that production will not be interrupted due to insufficient raw materials, and the produced products will not have sales channels.

However, at present, some disaster areas only focus on sideline production and ignore agricultural production, which is also wrong. For example, in Caopi Township, Echeng County, Hubei Province, they were busy earning money by swaying boats, so that they did not rescue 150 shi of rice that could be rescued; in Yingshan Township in this county, eight mutual aid groups only paid attention to sideline production, and they did not plant even one sheng of the originally planned three shi of vegetables. The reason for this mistake is mainly because the cadres in these areas do not understand that doing a good job in agricultural production is the most fundamental way to tide over the famine, and the development of sideline production must be based on the principle of not hindering agricultural production and being conducive to the development of agricultural production; they do not understand that although sideline production can help disaster victims solve some difficulties, sideline production cannot directly produce grain. If the disaster areas do not produce as much grain or substitute food as possible, reduce disaster losses, and solve the problem of food in the local area, it will inevitably increase the difficulty of the government's grain supply work, which is very unfavorable to the people in the disaster areas.

Vigorously developing the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement is the main link to ensure that the people in the disaster areas can quickly restore production and tide over the famine. It would be a grave mistake to pit mutual aid and cooperation against production, thinking that in some areas where severe disasters have occurred, they can abandon the leadership of mutual aid and cooperation by being busy with restoring production. The result would only be to cause serious damage to the countryside, bankrupt the vast number of farmers, and cause class differentiation in the countryside. At present, some disaster areas have already seen the phenomenon of lending money at exorbitant interest against the security of green crops in the field, which is worth paying close attention to. If we do not strengthen the leadership of mutual aid and cooperation organizations in the disaster areas, and implement the disaster relief policy of saving food to overcome the disaster with agricultural production as the main focus among the vast number of farmers, then there is nothing surprising about the occurrence of lending money at exorbitant interest against the security of green crops in the field in the disaster areas. Therefore, the Party and government leading organs in the disaster areas must pay attention to combining production and disaster relief and mutual aid and cooperation well.

This year's task of production and disaster relief is quite arduous. But as long as we resolutely implement the Party's leadership policy in the countryside and rely closely on the broad masses of farmers, the disaster will definitely be overcome and the difficulties can definitely be overcome.

    做好受灾地区的生产救灾工作
    林准
    经过几个月来的艰苦奋斗，长江中下游和淮河沿岸地区的人民，已经基本上战胜了百年未有的洪水。目前受灾地区各级党委和人民政府的主要任务，就是要领导人民做好生产救灾工作，迅速地恢复生产，重建家园。
    今年党和政府领导人民进行的防汛斗争和生产救灾工作，是过去任何政府都不能比拟的。由于我们进行了艰巨斗争的结果，武汉市水位虽曾高达二十九点七三公尺，却仍然屹立在洪水面前，南京等城市也始终抵御了洪水的侵袭。在淮河流域，广大的平原地区有的免除了灾害，有的减轻了灾害；苏北运河堤防也始终保证了安全，苏北平原数千万亩农田完全免除了灾害。在防汛抢险阶段，国家即已拨出了救济款五千五百多亿元，贷款九千四百亿元，供应口粮五亿一千多万斤，各种晚秋作物种籽两亿多斤。为了帮助被淹地区的人民转移到安全地区，党和政府还进行了巨大的组织工作，使灾民有计划地有秩序地进行了转移；安置地区的群众，也发扬了高度友爱互助精神，使灾民在生活方面和生产方面都得到了很大方便。因此，受灾地区的人民都充满了战胜灾害的信心。
    但是要领导受灾地区的人民最后地战胜灾害，渡过灾荒，还是一个相当长时期的艰巨任务。
    领导受灾地区的人民搞好农业生产，是早日渡过灾荒的最基本的办法。目前全国受灾农田大部分已排除了渍水，除了经过抢救保持了一定收成的以外，需要补种或改种的农田，也已大部分进行了补种或改种。作好这些农田的田间管理工作，提高这些农田的收获量，就能够解决灾区人民今冬明春的大部分口粮问题。同时，随着江河的落水，及时地作好那些尚未脱水农田的排水工作，争取能够不误农时地播种小麦、大麦、油菜、蚕豆、豌豆等作物，对灾区人民早日渡过灾荒也有十分重要的意义。为了适应渡荒需要，受灾地区还应尽量利用冬闲地，田边隙地，多种白菜、芥菜等各种冬季菜蔬。俗话说：“有菜半年粮，无菜半年荒”，“家有三担菜，不怕年景坏”。这些都是群众的宝贵的渡荒经验。如果作好了这些工作，渡过灾荒便基本上有了保证。受灾地区的耕牛饲养问题，目前由于采用了寄养或集体放养等办法，已暂时得到解决。但是对保护灾区耕牛安全过冬，和准备灾区耕牛过冬所需饲草问题，各地必须及早大力设法解决。这一个问题解决的好坏，关系着受灾地区明年春耕生产的能否顺利进行和今后农业生产的能否迅速恢复发展。
    领导受灾地区的人民，在不妨碍农业生产并有利农业生产的原则下，搞好副业生产，也是渡过灾荒的一个有效办法。去年许多水灾严重地区，今年春荒不重，主要是由于副业生产有成绩。河北省受灾地区的人民去年一冬副业活动，获利达六亿斤粮食之多，不仅解决了渡荒时期的困难，而且还利用副业盈余添置农具、购买耕牛，扩大了农业生产。今年受灾地区有些也已经动手在搞副业生产，如江苏省江浦县七个受灾较重的乡，已经搞起的副业生产有打鱼、织苇席、织渔网、挖药材、编竹篮等十多种，其中打鱼一项，预计到年底即可收入鲜鱼五、六十万斤。今年的受灾地区，一般出产丰富，副业生产门路多，特别是沿江沿湖的受灾地区，水上副业有一定的基础，今年水大鱼多，更应大力开展水上生产。在组织副业生产的工作中，人民政府应当解决灾民从事副业生产的困难，银行、信用合作部门，应当在贷款等方面给予帮助；商业、供销合作部门，应扩大对灾区的收购计划，供应或者贷给灾民生产工具和原料，同时和灾民订立供、产、销合同，以保证灾民生产的计划性，不会因原料不足而中断生产，也不会使生产出来的东西没有销路。
    但是，目前有些受灾地区只注重副业生产，忽视农业生产，这种作法也是错误的。例如湖北省鄂城县草陂乡，忙于荡船摆渡赚钱，以致有一百五十石稻谷可以抢救也没有抢救；这个县应山乡有八个互助组，只注意去搞副业生产，原计划种三石田的菜，一升也没有种。产生这种错误的原因，主要是由于这些地区的干部不了解搞好农业生产是渡过灾荒的最基本的办法，开展副业生产必须以不妨碍农业生产和有利农业生产发展为原则；不了解副业生产虽然能够帮助灾民解决一部分困难，但副业生产不能直接生产粮食，如果受灾地区不尽可能生产一部分粮食或代食品，减少受灾损失，解决本地区的口粮问题，就势必增加政府粮食供应工作的困难，这对灾区人民是十分不利的。
    大力开展农村互助合作运动，是保证灾区人民能够迅速恢复生产，渡过灾荒的主要环节。如果把互助合作同生产对立起来，以为在部分地区发生了严重的灾荒，忙于恢复生产，就可以放弃对互助合作的领导，这是十分错误的，其结果只会使灾荒在农村造成严重的破坏，使广大农民破产，使农村阶级发生分化。目前有的受灾地区，已经发生了放青苗的现象，这是值得十分注意的。如果不加强对受灾地区互助合作组织的领导，在广大农民中间贯彻以农业生产为主的生产救灾节约渡荒的救灾方针，那么，在受灾地区发生放青苗等现象是没有什么奇怪的。因此，受灾地区的党政领导机关，必须注意把生产救灾和互助合作很好的结合起来。
    今年的生产救灾任务是相当繁重的。但是只要我们坚决贯彻党在农村的领导方针，紧紧依靠广大农民群众，灾荒是一定能够战胜的，困难是一定可以克服的。
