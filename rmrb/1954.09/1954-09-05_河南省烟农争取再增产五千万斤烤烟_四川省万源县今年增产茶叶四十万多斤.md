    Henan Province is vigorously calling on tobacco farmers to leave two crops of early tobacco fields and harvest and bake or dry all the foot and top leaves of early and late tobacco in order to increase tobacco leaf production, without affecting autumn plowing and sowing, in order to strive to overfulfill the cured tobacco production plan. The Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative of Songzhuang Township, Xuchang County, was the first to respond to the government's call, revised its autumn cured tobacco production increase plan, and challenged tobacco farmers throughout the province. The cooperative planted a total of 25 mu of cured tobacco and decided to leave two crops on 20 mu, striving to produce 70 jin of sucker tobacco per mu. The Xubingchen Agricultural Production Cooperative of Shuangmiao Township, Xiangcheng County, also plans to leave two crops on 100 mu. Under the leadership and influence of the agricultural production cooperatives, the vast number of tobacco farmers in the province actively responded to the government's call and strived to complete the task of increasing cured tobacco production by another 50 million jin. In order to cooperate with the smooth progress of this work, the Henan Province Tobacco Purchasing Department, in addition to guaranteeing the purchase of all the substandard tobacco sold by tobacco farmers, also formulated reasonable purchase prices and made full preparations in specific purchasing work. The Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the People's Governments of key tobacco-producing areas have also successively dispatched technical cadres to go deep into the tobacco areas to summarize and promote the experience of leaving two crops of tobacco and baking foot and top leaves.

    Wanyuan County, Sichuan Province, increased tea production by more than 400,000 jin this year, with a total output increasing by 30 percent compared to last year.
    This year, tea farmers have planned to expand the planting area of tea trees. Last year, more than 280,000 abandoned tea bushes were restored, more than 230,000 tea trees were transplanted, and more than 100,000 tea trees were planted from seed; this spring, tea farmers transplanted more than 200,000 tea bushes.
    Since spring, the Wanyuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the County People's Government have held tea farmer representative meetings in various tea-producing areas to publicize and implement tea production policies and dispel the concerns of some tea farmers about developing tea production. The Wanyuan Branch of the China Tea Industry Experimental Farm and the Construction Section of the Wanyuan County People's Government also organized working groups to set up technical guidance stations in key tea-producing areas such as Baiyang, Qinghua, and Dazhu, going deep into the mountainous areas to strengthen technical guidance. General tea gardens have undergone pruning, soil cultivation, pest control, and other work, as well as intertillage, weeding, and topdressing, laying a good foundation for this year's tea production increase.
    This year, tea-rolling machines were widely promoted during tea harvesting, which improved tea quality and saved labor. After the Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qinghua Township adopted tea-rolling machines, the previous medium-grade tea was upgraded to first-class tea, and 160 man-days of labor were saved. After selling the tea, tea farmers are actively purchasing fertilizers and seeds, preparing for autumn plowing and sowing and autumn fertilization of tea trees, striving for a greater tea harvest next year.

    河南省烟农争取再增产五千万斤烤烟
    四川省万源县今年增产茶叶四十万多斤
    河南省为了争取超额完成烤烟生产计划，大力号召烟农在不影响秋耕秋播的前提下，将全部早烟田留二茬烟，并将早、晚烟的所有脚叶、顶叶全部采收烘烤或晒制，以增加烟叶的产量。许昌县宋庄乡前进农业生产合作社首先响应了政府的号召，修订了秋季烤烟增产计划，向全省烟农挑战。该社共种烤烟二十五亩，决定留二茬烟二十亩，争取每亩产杈子烟七十斤。襄城县双庙乡徐丙辰农业生产合作社也计划留二茬一百亩。在农业生产合作社的带头和影响下，全省广大烟农积极响应政府号召，争取完成再增产五千万斤烤烟任务。为了配合这一工作的顺利进行，河南省烟草收购部门除保证收购烟农出售的全部次烟外，并订出了合理收购价格，在具体收购工作方面也作了充分准备，省农林厅及产烟重点区的人民政府也先后派遣技术干部深入烟区，总结和推广留二茬烟及烘烤脚叶、顶叶的经验。　（王守本）

    四川省万源县今年增产茶叶四十万多斤，总产量比去年增加百分之三十。
    今年茶农们有计划地扩大了茶树种植面积。去年已恢复荒茶二十八万多丛，移植茶树二十三万多丛，点种茶树十多万株；今年春天茶农们又移植茶树二十多万丛。
    从春天以来，中共万源县委员会和县人民政府在各产茶区分别召开茶农代表会，宣传贯彻茶叶生产政策，解除某些茶农对发展茶叶生产的顾虑。中国茶业试验场万源分场、万源县人民政府建设科也组织了工作组，在白羊、青花、大竹等重点产茶区设立了技术指导站，深入山区加强技术指导，一般茶园都进行了整枝、培土、治虫等工作，并进行中耕、除草、施追肥，给今年茶叶增产打下了良好的基础。
    今年在收摘茶叶时，普遍推广了揉茶机，提高了茶叶质量，节省了劳动力。青花乡宏光农业生产合作社采用揉茶机后，使往年的中等茶提高为上等茶，并节省一百六十个人工。茶农们卖了茶叶后，正积极购买肥料和种籽，准备秋耕秋种和茶树的秋季施肥，争取明年茶叶更大的丰收。
