    Kunming Institute of Technology Established

    The first multidisciplinary institute of technology in the Southwest focusing on non-ferrous metal mining and metallurgy – Kunming Institute of Technology – was officially established on the 1st. This institute was established independently from the Engineering Department of Yunnan University and currently has departments of mining, metallurgy, and general mechanical manufacturing. Following the establishment of Kunming Institute of Technology, students from the Engineering Department of Guizhou University have transferred here to enroll.

    Kunming Institute of Technology is located in the northern suburbs of Kunming City, with a school building area of more than 24,800 square meters. In addition to newly built classrooms, libraries, reading rooms, and eight laboratories for physics, chemistry, and geology, there is also a factory for student internships, including three workshops for machinery, foundry, and forging, and three laboratories for electrical engineering, mining, and mineral processing.

    昆明工学院成立
    西南第一个以有色金属采矿、冶金为重点的多科性工学院——昆明工学院已在一日正式成立。这所工学院是由云南大学工学院独立建校成立的，现在设有采矿系、冶金系和普通机械制造系。昆明工学院成立后，贵州大学工学院的学生已转到这里入学。
    昆明工学院设在昆明市北郊，校舍面积共有二万四千八百多平方公尺，除新修的教室、书库、阅览室和物理、化学、地质等八个实验室外，还有一个供学生实习用的工厂，包括机械、铸工、锻工等三个车间和电工、采矿、选矿等三个实验室。
