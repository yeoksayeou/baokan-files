Telegram from the Presidium of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic to the Presidium of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China in Beijing:

On behalf of the Presidium of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic and all peace-loving German people, I extend heartfelt congratulations and respect to the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China. The constitution submitted to the People's Congress for discussion is an unprecedented major event in the democratic construction of the People's Republic of China. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, which once brutally plundered the people, has today exposed itself before the whole world as a bunch bought by US imperialism, carrying out provocative activities in an attempt to incite new war adventures in Asia. At this moment, the great Chinese people are striding forward with heads held high, striving to unite closely to achieve their great national goals. The German people deeply believe that no matter how the US imperialists and the traitor Chiang Kai-shek attempt to undermine the peaceful construction of New China, they will ultimately be crushed by the resolute will of the Chinese people. The People's Republic of China has become a major country of significant influence in the international arena, a shining example for the people of Asia, and has inspired them in their struggle against imperialism, to fight for peace, national unity and independence, and against military pacts attempting to maintain the old imperialist rule in Asia. The people of Asia and the people of Europe do not need or want aggressive military blocs of individual countries, but need collective security guaranteed to all, to ensure peace, happiness and prosperity. The German Democratic Republic, together with the People's Republic of China, in the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, is doing everything possible to fight for the defense of peace, and will continue to work to further consolidate and strengthen friendship with the Chinese people. In the name of the Presidium of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic and myself, I wish the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China a successful completion of its important tasks.

          Dr. Johannes Dieckmann, Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic

    德意志民主共和国人民议院主席团电北京中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会主席团：
    我代表德意志民主共和国人民议院主席团以及全体爱好和平的德国人民，对中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会致衷心的祝贺和敬意。提交人民代表大会讨论的宪法，是中华人民共和国民主建设中的一件空前的大事。过去曾经残酷地掠夺人民的蒋介石卖国集团今日已在全世界眼前暴露出他们是美帝国主义所收买的家伙，他们进行挑衅活动，企图在亚洲引起新的战争冒险。而在这时，伟大的中国人民正挺胸昂首地大踏步前进，争取紧密团结一致地实现他们伟大的全民目标。德国人民深深相信，美帝国主义者和卖国贼蒋介石无论怎么企图破坏新中国的和平建设，最后必将被中国人民的坚决意志所粉碎。中华人民共和国已成为一个在国际上举足轻重的大国，它成了亚洲人民光辉的范例，并鼓舞了他们反对帝国主义的斗争，使他们去为争取和平、民族统一和独立、为反对企图在亚洲维持旧日帝国主义统治的军事公约而奋斗。亚洲人民以及欧洲人民都不需要、也不愿意要个别国家的侵略性军事集团，而需要大家都能受到保障的集体安全，以保障和平、幸福和富裕。德意志民主共和国和中华人民共和国一起，在以苏联为首的和平阵营之中尽一切力量为保卫和平而战斗，它今后亦将努力进一步巩固和加强对中国人民的友谊。我谨以德意志民主共和国人民议院主席团和我个人的名义，祝中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会顺利地完成它的重大任务。
          德意志民主共和国人民议院主席团主席约·狄克曼博士
