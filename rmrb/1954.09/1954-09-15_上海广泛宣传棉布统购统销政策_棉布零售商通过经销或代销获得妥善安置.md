    Shanghai Widely Publicizes Cotton Cloth Unified Purchase and Marketing Policy; Cotton Cloth Retailers Properly Placed Through Distribution or Consignment Sales
    [This newspaper, Shanghai, 14th dispatch] According to the order of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on implementing planned purchase and planned supply of cotton cloth, all large and medium-sized cities and major towns in East China will implement planned supply of cotton cloth starting from September 15th.
    The Shanghai Municipal People's Government Committee and the Municipal Consultative Committee held a joint meeting on September 13th to discuss measures for implementing the order on planned purchase and planned supply of cotton cloth. On September 14th, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government announced specific measures for implementing the planned supply of cotton cloth, and organized propaganda efforts to widely and thoroughly publicize the correct measures of the central government to the masses.
    Prior to this, East China had also carried out corresponding transformations of private cotton cloth businesses. All machine-woven cloth produced by private factories in East China and Shanghai had been completely controlled by state-owned commercial enterprises by the end of August; all private cotton cloth wholesalers had been transferred to other occupations or properly arranged for, and retailers had generally established distribution or consignment relationships with state-owned cotton yarn and cloth companies or with other state-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives entrusted by these companies. After preliminary transformation, cotton cloth merchants in various regions have begun to make improvements in business management.
    In order to implement the task of planned supply of cotton cloth, various regions, under the leadership of Party committees and governments at all levels, have also correspondingly replenished and added supply organizations, and have universally inspected and replenished cotton cloth inventories to ensure the needs of the peak season.

    上海广泛宣传棉布统购统销政策
    棉布零售商通过经销或代销获得妥善安置
    【本报上海十四日电】根据中央人民政府政务院关于实行棉布计划收购和计划供应的命令，华东地区所有大、中城市和主要城镇，从九月十五日开始实行棉布计划供应。
    上海市人民政府委员会和市协商委员会在九月十三日举行联席会议，讨论了执行棉布计划收购和计划供应命令的办法。九月十四日，上海市人民政府公布了实行棉布计划供应的具体措施。并组织宣传力量，广泛深入地向群众宣传中央的正确措施。
    在这以前，华东各地对私营棉布商业也进行了相应的改造工作。华东及上海市所有私营工厂生产的机织布，到八月底止，已全部由国营商业掌握；私营棉布批发商已全部转业或安排就绪，零售商一般已与国营花纱布公司或与受该公司委托的其他国营商业部门及供销合作社建立了经销或代销关系。经过初步改造后，各地棉布商在经营管理方面，已开始有了改进。
    为了贯彻执行棉布计划供应的任务，各地在各级党委和政府的领导下，还相应地充实和增设了供应机构，并普遍检查和充实了棉布库存，以保证旺季需要。
