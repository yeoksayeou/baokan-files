We are able to represent the Tibetan people at this meeting, especially to see Chairman Mao, the great leader of all nationalities, in Beijing, the capital of the motherland, which is the most glorious thing in my life, and I feel infinitely excited. Along the way, we have personally seen that the people's governments at all levels strictly abide by Chairman Mao's brilliant policy of national equality and unity and the policy of freedom of religious belief, and that there is close cooperation between all nationalities and within nationalities. In the future, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and the great leader Chairman Mao, the Panchen Erdeni and I, together with all the monks, officials and people of Tibet, will strive to build a new Tibet and improve the people's lives. The Panchen Erdeni said: During my trip to Beijing this time, I have received the enthusiastic care and help of the people's governments at all levels and the people of all nationalities along the way, which has made me deeply feel the care of the Communist Party and the People's Government for the minority nationalities, and feel the kindness and loveliness of the big family of the motherland. This time, the Dalai Lama and I represent the Tibetan region to attend the National People's Congress meeting, which makes me feel that we shoulder a glorious and important responsibility in the cause of building a new Tibet in the motherland. The Dalai Lama and I must be more closely united and cooperate, and in the great cause of building the motherland, fulfill our glorious responsibilities and fulfill the Tibetan people's entrustment to the Dalai Lama and to me.
