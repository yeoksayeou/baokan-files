Xinhua News Agency, August 31st: The 1954 academic year has begun, with national institutions of higher education commencing classes successively from September 1st. Schools have completed preparations for the new academic year, and faculty and students are enthusiastically welcoming incoming students. Over 79,000 students who participated in production internships are returning to their schools, ready to apply practical knowledge gained from their internships to their intensive studies.

	The number of students in institutions of higher education has significantly increased this academic year. With the enrollment of over 94,000 new students admitted this summer, the total number of students in national institutions of higher education has reached over 250,000, an increase of approximately 60.6 percent compared to the highest year (1947) under the Kuomintang reactionary rule. To accommodate the needs of growing schools, the state has constructed a total of 1.05 million square meters of new school buildings for various institutions of higher education this year.

	This year, the nation has adjusted and newly established two higher industrial schools: the engineering college of Sichuan University has become independent and renamed Chengdu Institute of Technology, with the addition of the automotive highway and urban road specialization from Chongqing Institute of Architectural Engineering, transforming it into a multi-disciplinary institute of technology. The engineering college of Yunnan University has become independent and renamed Kunming Institute of Technology, focusing on non-ferrous metallurgy and mining as a key multi-disciplinary institute of technology. Based on the Beijing Institute of Foreign Trade, the foreign trade specializations of Renmin University of China and Shanghai University of Finance and Economics have been merged to establish the Beijing Institute of Foreign Trade. Peking University, Fudan University, and Northwest University have newly established law departments. The establishment and adjustment of these schools and departments will enable the nation to cultivate talent for construction more systematically and utilize human and material resources more rationally.

	After the start of the new academic year, all types of institutions of higher education will implement the new teaching plans for first-year students. Unified professional teaching plans have been developed for over 130 engineering specializations. Unified teaching plans or transitional teaching plans have also been developed for science, arts, agriculture and forestry, finance and economics, and political science and law disciplines, providing a unified basis for schools to organize teaching work. In order to rationally utilize faculty resources, fully leverage teachers' abilities, implement the principle of distribution according to work, and promote teaching reform and scientific research, the "Provisional Measures for Working Days and Teaching Workload of University Teachers" will be implemented in national institutions of higher education starting from the 1954 academic year. This will ensure teachers have practical teaching time.

Xinhua News Agency reports: Secondary schools and below across the country will successively begin classes around September 1st. Before the start of the new academic year, many secondary schools in various regions have expanded or built new school buildings and added teaching equipment. Investment in basic construction of secondary schools in various regions has increased compared to previous years. The number of secondary normal schools has also increased this year. Some urban secondary schools with suitable conditions have decided to operate on a two-shift system. Graduates of many higher normal schools and teachers who have undergone professional training will join secondary schools this semester. In Jiangsu Province, over 400 junior high school teachers will serve as teachers in high schools and normal schools after studying in summer training classes for secondary school teachers. In Shanghai, more than 1,400 new teachers will participate in teaching in middle schools. To meet the growing needs of primary and secondary schools nationwide, the People's Education Press plans to publish more than 330 million copies of primary and secondary school textbooks this year, an increase of about 6.5 percent compared to last year. In addition, local publishing houses will publish more than 4 million copies of textbooks in Mongolian, Korean, Uyghur, Kazakh, and other minority languages. Some newly compiled textbooks with colored illustrations will also be published this year.

	This year, approximately 1.17 million new students will enroll in junior high schools nationwide, and approximately 190,000 new students will enroll in senior high schools. The number of students in ordinary secondary schools nationwide will reach approximately 3.6 million, an increase of 23 percent compared to 1953 and nearly one and a half times the highest year (1946) during the Kuomintang rule. Secondary schools in Southwest China have admitted more than 160,000 new students, an increase of more than 60,000 compared to last year. Shanghai secondary schools have enrolled more than 86,000 students, and the total number of secondary school students has increased by more than 40,000 compared to 1953, while the total number of primary school students has increased by more than 25,000 compared to 1953. Party committees, relevant government departments, and the Communist Youth League organizations have been very concerned about young people applying for admission and have carried out publicity, education, and volunteer guidance work in advance. Some junior high school and senior primary school graduates who have not been promoted will be absorbed into approximately 20 central and local business departments to work. In order to meet the needs of developing agricultural production cooperatives in the province this winter and next spring, Hebei Province will train a group of cooperative accountants in batches by special districts and counties. The first batch will train 10,000 people, initially selected from senior primary school graduates currently in agricultural production cooperatives recommended by counties and districts.

	This year, more junior high school graduates than expected have applied for secondary specialized schools. After more than two years of adjustment, consolidation, and reform, various types of secondary specialized schools have basically been reorganized into new types of secondary specialized schools and have begun to train cadres according to the needs of various sectors of the national economy and the principles of specialization. Currently, various types of secondary specialized schools have clarified their professional settings, have some unified teaching plans and teaching outlines, and have begun to organize teaching work according to new methods. Relevant business departments have also strengthened their leadership over various types of secondary specialized schools.

	Workers' and peasants' accelerated secondary schools in various regions have also basically completed their enrollment tasks. The proportion of industrial workers among new students is estimated to reach 30 to 40 percent. In Shanghai, 70 percent of the new students enrolled in eight workers' and peasants' accelerated secondary schools are industrial workers. Industrial workers account for 80 percent of the new students in the workers' and peasants' accelerated secondary school attached to Harbin Institute of Technology. Among the new students enrolled in six workers' and peasants' accelerated secondary schools in Jiangsu Province are Xu Jianhua, a national textile industry labor model, Li Xiaying, the leader of a national textile industry model group, and Bai Hanru, a Huai River harnessing model.

    一九五四年度新学年开始
    大中学新生一百四十多万人入学
    【新华社三十一日讯】一九五四年度新学年开始了，全国高等学校从九月一日起陆续开学。各校已经完成新学年的准备工作，广大师生正热情地迎接新生到校。今年参加生产实习的七万九千多学生正先后返回学校，他们将带着在实习中所获得的实际知识，投入新的紧张的学习生活。
    在这个新学年里，高等学校学生有显著增加。今年暑期录取的九万四千多名新生入学后，全国高等学校在校学生总数达到二十五万多人，比国民党反动统治时期最高年份一九四七年在校学生总数增加百分之六十点六左右。为了适应各校发展的需要，今年国家为各高等学校建筑的新校舍共达一百零五万平方公尺。
    今年，全国调整新建了两所高等工业学校：四川大学工学院独立建校，改为成都工学院，并将重庆建筑工程学院汽车干路与城市道路专业并入，成为多科性工学院。云南大学工学院独立建校，改为昆明工学院，成为以有色冶金和采矿为重点的多科性工学院。以北京对外贸易专科学校为基础，合并中国人民大学和上海财经学院的对外贸易专业，成立北京对外贸易学院。北京大学、复旦大学、西北大学三校新成立了法律系。这些学校和系科的新建与调整，使国家培养建设人材的工作更加有计划，人力物力的使用更加合理了。
    新学年开始后，各类高等学校对一年级学生都将按照新的教学计划进行教学。工科一百三十多种专业都有了统一的专业教学计划，理科、文科、农林、财经、政法等科也都有了统一的教学计划或制订了过渡性的教学计划，使各校组织教学工作有了统一的依据。为了合理地使用师资，充分发挥教师的能力，贯彻按劳取酬的原则，推动教学改革和科学研究工作，自一九五四年新学年起，全国高等学校将实行“高等学校教师的工作日及教学工作量暂行办法”。这样就使教师的教学时间有了切实的保证。
    据新华社讯：全国中等以下学校在九月一日前后陆续开学。在新学年开始前，各地很多中等学校都增建或新建了校舍，添置了教学设备。各地中等学校基本建设的投资较往年都有增加。今年中等师范学校也有增加。有些城市中有条件的中学并已决定开办二部制。很多高等师范学校的毕业生和经过专业进修的教师这学期将参加到中学任教。江苏省有四百多初中教师在中学教师暑期进修班学习后，将担任高中和师范学校的教师。上海市参加中学任教的新教师有一千四百多名。人民教育出版社为满足全国中小学增长的需要，计划在今年出版中小学教科书三亿三千多万册，比去年约增加百分之六点五。另外，地方出版社还将出版四百多万册蒙古、朝鲜、维吾尔、哈萨克等少数民族文字的教科书。今年出版的书中还有一些新编的带有彩色图画的教科书。
    今年全国初级中学将有一百一十七万左右的新生入学，高级中学有十九万左右的新生入学。全国普通中学的在校学生数将达到三百六十万人左右，比一九五三年增加了百分之二十三，比国民党统治时期的最高年份（一九四六年）增加了将近一倍半。西南各地中等学校共录取新生十六万多名，比去年多招收了六万多名。上海市中学招生八万六千多名，中学生总人数比一九五三年增加四万多名，小学生总人数比一九五三年增加二万五千多名。各地党委、政府有关部门和青年团组织对青年报考入学十分关怀，事先都展开了宣传教育和指导志愿等工作。部分未升学的初中和高小毕业生将被吸收到中央以及地方的约二十多个业务部门去工作。河北省为了适应全省今冬明春发展农业生产合作社的需要，将分期分别由专区、县训练一批合作社的会计人员，第一批训练一万人，首先由县、区保送现在农业生产合作社的高小毕业生参加。
    今年，各地有较预计为多的初中毕业生报考中等专业学校。各类中等专业学校经过两年多的调整、整顿和改革工作，已基本上改组成为新型的中等专业学校，开始按照国民经济各部门的需要和专业化的原则来培养干部。现在各类中等专业学校已明确了专业设置，有了部分统一的教学计划和教学大纲，并已开始按新的方法组织教学工作。各有关业务部门并加强了对各类中等专业学校的领导。
    各地工农速成中学也基本上完成了招生任务。新生中产业工人的比例估计达到百分之三十到四十。上海市八所工农速成中学录取的新生中有百分之七十是产业工人。哈尔滨工业大学附设工农速成中学的新生中产业工人占百分之八十。江苏省六所工农速成中学录取的新生中有全国纺织工业劳动模范徐建华、全国纺织工业模范小组组长李霞影、治淮模范柏汉如等。
