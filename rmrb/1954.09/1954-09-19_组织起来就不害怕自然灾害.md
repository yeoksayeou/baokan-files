    Organized, We Are Not Afraid of Natural Disasters
    Dong Lin
    Hearing the news that Li You'an was elected as a delegate to the National People's Congress, I naturally thought of some confident words he said to me in early August this year.
    This year, there was too much rain. The Tushan Agricultural Production Cooperative, led by Li You'an in Xuancheng County, Anhui Province, had three-quarters of its fields flooded fifteen or sixteen times. However, they never bowed their heads to the flood, but instead, boosted their spirits to fight continuously and compete with the flood for grain. He said: "This winter and next spring, our cooperative will work with other cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers to build a dike downstream, and construct some other water conservancy projects, so that our land can withstand even greater floods than this year in the future. Under the leadership and help of the Communist Party and the People's Government, we organized farmers will definitely be able to overcome natural disasters!"
    I missed this agricultural production cooperative and wanted to know how they were fighting the disaster recently, so I went to Tushan Village again.
    When I arrived in Tushan Village, Li You'an, the chairman of the cooperative, had not yet returned from attending the First People's Congress of Anhui Province in Hefei. That afternoon, the cooperative was holding an enlarged meeting of cooperative cadres to discuss the autumn harvest and increase the production of late autumn crops. Of the cooperative's nearly 800 mu of rice fields, more than 500 mu are still covered in white water, with no green to be seen. Only 290 mu of rice can be harvested, totaling only more than 60,000 jin of rice. The disaster situation is quite serious. At this meeting, they studied in detail the division of labor and distribution methods for the autumn harvest, determined to preserve the regenerating rice as much as possible after harvesting, and also made preliminary plans to overcome the famine in the future based on the cooperative's situation. The cadres' emotions were optimistic, firm, and full of confidence. If one did not look at the statistics and crops, it would be difficult for people to feel how serious the disaster was here this year from their words and expressions.
    The next day, not long after dawn, the threshing ground became lively, with twenty or so flails beating the golden rice grains and scattering them everywhere. In the distance, people stood in waist-deep water cutting the ripe rice ears, and transported them to the threshing ground by boats and wooden basins. Near noon, a gust of wind suddenly rolled up dark clouds like boiling water from the western horizon. Raindrops the size of soybeans hit people so hard that they could not open their eyes. At this time, adults and children rushed up together, and in less than a quarter of an hour, they safely piled the rice on the threshing ground in the newly built main room of the cooperative chairman Li You'an's house.
    At the same time as the rush harvest of rice in this rainstorm, a new life was born in the Tushan Agricultural Production Cooperative. 社员陶茂发's wife gave birth to a white and fat daughter, and both mother and child were safe, everyone rejoiced. In the afternoon, Cooperative Affairs Committee member Tao Shengwen specially bought two catties of brown sugar from Shuangqiao and sent it to the lying-in woman. This was the cooperative's congratulations to the newborn infant. After a rainstorm, the houses and trees washed by the rain looked particularly fresh when illuminated by the sun. A group of children were playing on the threshing ground, the older ones leading the ones who had just learned to walk, catching dragonflies with bamboo brooms.
    Why are the people here so optimistic, calm, and strong in the face of natural disasters?
    Jia Yuhe, the party branch secretary of Tushan Township, answered my question:
    "Mainly because we are organized." Jia Yuhe told me about the situation in which they had organized and defeated natural disasters to achieve bumper harvests in recent years.
    In 1951, Li You'an's mutual aid team was rewarded by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government for its bumper harvest. This greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of farmers for mutual aid and cooperation. In the spring of 1952, Li You'an's mutual aid team was transformed into a cooperative. In the autumn of that year, they achieved an unprecedented large-scale bumper harvest. The cooperative's 349.8 mu of rice fields averaged 702 jin of rice per mu, of which 1.3 mu of high-yield fields reached a high yield of 1,086 jin per mu. Such a large harvest was not easy to come by. In addition to the unified use of land to achieve rational fertilization and rational irrigation, all the cooperative members also carried out arduous struggles against insect pests. That year, just as the rice was heading, the rice fields were full of rice leaf rollers. What to do? They could not watch the grain that was about to be eaten be taken away by pests. They went to the Xuancheng County Farm to learn how to use large combs to comb out insects, made large combs when they came back, and combed out more than 700 jin of rice leaf rollers in four or five days. The year 1953 was not a smooth year either. When transplanting rice seedlings, it did not rain for more than forty consecutive days; if it were in previous years, either the seedlings could not be transplanted, or they would be transplanted and die from drought. However, the cooperative's rice still had a bumper harvest. What happened? Water conservancy was well constructed. From the establishment of the cooperative to the spring of 1953, in addition to extracting labor to participate in the construction of Tonggong Dam and the general irrigation ditch, they also dug two sub-ditches on the cooperative's more than 300 mu of land, totaling about two li in length. Digging two ditches does not seem to be a difficult task, but it would not be easy to do without organizing a cooperative. When they were still a mutual aid team, they also dug ditches; digging a ditch required cutting off a little bit of the field edge of team member Zheng Xianshan's house, and he was unwilling to do so; later, everyone gave him a certain price before the small ditch was successfully opened. It is different with a cooperative. In the cooperative, for the sake of the collective, that is, for yourself, these obstacles no longer exist.
    After the cooperative was organized, production increased, and the lives of farmers also improved. Compared with 1951 and 1952, the actual income of cooperative members increased by an average of about 40%. Since the establishment of the cooperative, the entire cooperative has built 45 new houses, married ten new daughters-in-law, and added twenty-three children. Now, almost every cooperative member's family has industrial products such as thermos bottles and rubber shoes, and soybean oil lamps have been replaced with kerosene lamps.
    Is the cooperative consolidated in the face of such a severe famine this year? Old Jia said: "You can't break them up with a stick now." Looking at how the cooperative members led by Li You'an are fighting with floods for grain this year, you will believe that this is true.
    This year, when the rice seedlings were being transplanted, the flood came. The magnitude of the flood and the height of the water level were unprecedented for old men in their seventies and eighties; moreover, the river water was backed up by the Jiang tide and had been stagnant and not receding. All the seedlings were drowned by the flood. The cooperative affairs committee held an emergency meeting and decided to replant. They sent five boats to places fifty or sixty li away to buy old seedlings, and bought late rice seeds from the county grain bureau. When the flood receded slightly, the rice seeds were sown and the old seedlings were transplanted, who knew that the flood would once again destroy the seedlings. "It doesn't matter if they are destroyed, we will do it again!" They transplanted seedlings and sowed seeds again. In this way, from the beginning of the flood to the present, for more than 100 days, the rice seedlings have been flooded again and again, and transplanted again and again. In the most tense days, the cooperative members heightened the field ridges in the water, draining water day and night to rescue the seedlings. When the water was high, the field ridges collapsed more than 20 times a day. When the wind and waves were high, they stood side by side on the field ridges, sitting on the field ridges, protecting the field ridges; Youth League member Zhao Hongbao lay in the water to block the gap when the field ridge collapsed...
    That day, I talked with Old Jia about Li You'an being elected as a delegate to the National People's Congress, and I thought of many things, and we talked until late at night. It was raining again. In the distance, a few lights were reflected in the water, and the sound of waterwheel chants came from time to time:
    Organized, our strength is great,
    We are not afraid of natural disasters! ...

    组织起来就不害怕自然灾害
    冬林
    听到了李有安当选全国人民代表大会代表的消息，我很自然地想起了今年八月初他对我谈的一些充满信心的话。
    今年雨水太多，安徽省宣城县李有安领导的土山农业生产合作社，有四分之三的田亩被洪水淹了十五六次。可是他们始终没向洪水低头，鼓起劲头持续战斗，和洪水争粮食。他说：“今冬明春，我们的社要和别的社一起，团结互助组和单干农民，在下游穿一道圩埂，再兴修一些别的水利工程，使我们这片土地以后遇到比今年更大的水也能抵挡得住。在共产党和人民政府的领导和帮助下，我们组织起来的农民一定能战胜自然灾害！”
    我怀念着这个农业生产合作社，想知道他们最近和灾害斗争的情形，就又到土山村去了。
    当我到达土山村时，合作社主席李有安到合肥出席安徽省第一届人民代表大会去还没有回来。当天下午，正赶上社里召开社干部扩大会议，讨论秋收和增产晚秋作物问题。全社近八百亩水稻田，直到现在仍有五百多亩一片白水不见青，能够收割的稻子只有二百九十多亩，总计只能收六万多斤稻子。灾情是相当严重的。在这个会议上，他们详细研究了秋收的劳力分工和分配办法，确定收割过后尽量蓄养再生稻，还根据社里的情况初步打算了今后战胜灾荒的办法。干部们的情绪乐观、坚定，充满信心，如果不看统计数字和庄稼，人们很难从他们的言语和神色中感到这里今年遭受了多么严重的灾害。
    第二天，天刚亮不一会，场基上便热闹起来，二十几把连耞劈劈啪啪打得金黄的稻粒四下飞迸。远处，人们站在齐腰深的水中割着成熟的稻穗，用船和木盆运到场基上来。快到晌午的时候，突然一阵大风卷着乌云滚锅似的从西方地平线涌上来。黄豆般大小的雨点打得人睁不开眼。这时，大人小孩一齐涌上，不到一刻工夫，就把场基上的稻子安稳地堆存在社主席李有安家新盖的堂屋里了。
    就在这暴风雨中抢收稻子的同时，土山农业生产合作社里又诞生了一个新生命。社员陶茂发的妻子生了一个白胖的女儿，母子平安，大家欢庆。下午，社务委员陶盛文特地到双桥买回二斤红糖送给产妇，这是社里对新生婴儿的祝贺。一阵暴雨过后，雨水洗刷过的房屋、树木，被太阳一照，显得特别清新。场基上有一群孩子在嬉戏，大一点的牵着刚会走路的，用竹扫帚扑捉蜻蜓。
    这里的人们在自然灾害的面前，为什么这样乐观、镇定、坚强？
    土山乡的党支部书记贾雨和回答了我的问题：
    “主要是因为组织起来。”贾雨和跟我谈起这几年组织起来战胜自然灾害得到丰收的情形。
    一九五一年李有安互助组因为丰产受到了中央人民政府农业部的奖励。这件事大大激发了农民互助合作的积极性。一九五二年春天，李有安互助组转为合作社。这一年的秋季，他们获得空前的大面积丰收，全社三百四十九点八亩水稻田，平均每亩产稻子七百零二斤，其中一亩三分丰产田达到每亩一千零八十六斤的高额产量。这样大的丰收可不是容易的，除了因为统一使用土地做到合理施肥合理灌溉等以外，全体社员还向虫害进行了艰苦的斗争。那年，正当稻子结穗的时候，稻田里长满了稻苞虫。怎么办呢？不能看着到嘴的粮食被害虫夺去。他们到宣城县农场学习了使用大梳子梳虫的办法，回来做了大梳子，四五天工夫就梳了七百多斤稻苞虫。一九五三年，也不是个风调雨顺的年头。正在插秧的时候，一连四十多天不下雨；要是往年，不是秧栽不下去，就是栽下去干死掉。可是，社里的稻子仍然丰收了。怎么回事呢？水利兴修得好。从建社到一九五三年春季，他们除了抽出劳动力参加兴修佟公坝和灌溉总沟以外，还在社里的三百多亩土地上开挖了两条子沟，总共大约有二里长。挖两条沟似乎并不是一件难事，可是，要是不组织合作社却是不容易办到的。在他们还是互助组的时候，也曾挖过水沟；挖沟需要削掉组员郑贤山家一点点田边子，他说什么也不愿意；后来还是大家出给他一定的代价，才把这条小沟开成功。有了合作社就不一样了，在合作社里为了集体也就是为了自己，这些障碍就都不存在了。
    组织起来合作社以后，生产增加了，农民的生活也上升了。拿一九五一年和一九五二年相比，社员的实际收入平均增加百分之四十左右。建社以来，全社新盖了四十五间屋，娶了十个新媳妇，添了二十三个小孩子。现在，差不多每个社员家里都有热水瓶、胶鞋等工业品，豆油灯换成了煤油灯。
    在今年这样严重的灾荒的面前，合作社是不是巩固呢？老贾说：“这会儿你用棍子打也打不散他们。”看看今年李有安领导的社员们怎样和洪水争夺粮食，就会相信这话一点不假。
    今年正在插秧的时候，洪水就来了，水势之大，水位之高，七八十岁的老头子都没有听说过；而且河水受江潮顶托，一直停滞不退。秧苗统统被洪水淹死了。社务委员会召开了紧急会议，决定补栽。他们派了五只船到五六十里以外的地方买回了老秧，又从县粮食局买回了迟稻种籽。等到水势稍退，稻种撒下了，老秧栽上了，谁知洪水又一次把秧苗冲毁了。“毁了不要紧，我们重新再来！”他们又栽上秧，撒下种。就这样，从开始发大水到现在，一百多天以来，稻秧一次又一次地被洪水淹掉，
  一次又一次地补栽起来。在最紧张的日子里，社员们在水中加高田埂，日夜排水抢救秧苗。水大时，田埂一天倒二十多次。风大浪大，他们并排站在田埂上，坐在田埂上，保护着田埂；青年团员赵鸿保在田埂溃破时躺到水里堵住了缺口……
    这天，我跟老贾谈李有安当选全国人民代表大会代表的事，联想起来许多事情，一直谈到深夜。天又下雨了。远处的水里，映出几点灯火，不时传来几声车水号子：
    组织起来哟力量大，
    自然灾害哟不怕它噢！…………
