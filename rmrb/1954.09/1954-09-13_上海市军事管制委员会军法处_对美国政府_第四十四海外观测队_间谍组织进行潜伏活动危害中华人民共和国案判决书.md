Facts and Reasons

1. Defendant Redmond, an American from New York, participated in the U.S. Army Parachute Infantry Regiment. In April 1946, he received training at the spy school of the "War Department Strategic Services Unit" spy agency of the U.S. government in Washington. In August 1946, he was sent to China under the alias Jerome Strother, work code Euclid. He was assigned by the Shanghai General Station of the "44th Overseas Observation Detachment" spy organization of the U.S. government to the Beijing branch as a translator. Later, he was transferred to the Shenyang branch. The defendant, under the guise of a liaison officer of the American Liaison Group, specialized in contacting Chiang Kai-shek's military intelligence agencies, and telegraphed the military intelligence he obtained about our army to the Shanghai General Station of the "44th Overseas Observation Detachment" every day. In March 1948, the defendant was transferred back to the Shanghai General Station and was responsible for the compilation of war situation. In the autumn of the same year, he also served as the training and dispatch of intelligence personnel of the Positive Intelligence Section. He transferred the intelligence agent Wang Keyi, led by another American spy, Ronald Metz, of the Shanghai General Station, and the intelligence agent Cong Kezhong, led by John Singlaub, the station chief of the Shenyang branch, to his control. He gave Cong Kezhong spy training, personally instructing him on future tasks, methods, and contact methods for probing intelligence, and issued US$2,500 in funds for six months of espionage activities. He ordered Cong Kezhong to return to Shenyang and use the subversive radio station given to him by Singlaub to engage in espionage activities (Note: Cong Kezhong's subversive radio station was later moved to Beijing and has been uncovered by the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau). In October 1948, Redmond, through the relationship of Ernest Weidel, an American spy in the Counter Intelligence Section of the Shanghai General Station of the "44th Overseas Observation Detachment", contacted Xin Zuqi, a Kuomintang secret agent originally in Lushun. In addition to directly collecting military intelligence about the Lushun port from Xin Zuqi, he also provided training in photography techniques. In December 1948, he provided Xin Zuqi with two small cameras for espionage, six rolls of film, and US$750 in activity funds, ordering him to rush back to Lushun to steal photos of Lushun port's coastal defense facilities and air force bases. (Note: Xin Zuqi has been captured by the Lushun-Dalian Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau).

In the spring of 1949, as the People's Liberation Army approached the Yangtze River, Lloyd George, the person in charge of U.S. intelligence in the Far East, personally assigned Redmond the task of subversive activities. Subsequently, Robert Koke, the head of the intelligence team at the Shanghai General Station of the "44th Overseas Observation Detachment", instructed Redmond to lead the two subversive groups of Wang Keyi and Cong Kezhong (both equipped with radio stations), and asked him to establish an intelligence transportation network between Shanghai and Taiwan, develop more intelligence personnel, and continue to collect our military and political intelligence after liberation. Koke also found Redmond a cover job at Henningsen Produce Co. in Shanghai and allocated US$10,000 for espionage activities. After accepting the task, Redmond actively deployed subversive activities, provided Wang Keyi with three transceivers and sixteen codebooks for use by the subversive radio station, urged Wang Keyi and radio operator Xu Bin to test the radio station, recruited Wu Weilan as a translator, and funded the rental of an apartment for subversive activities. After the liberation of Shanghai, Redmond planned to resume contact with the radio station of the Cong Kezhong subversive group, and at the same time instructed Wang Keyi to report the intelligence he collected. In November 1949, the defendant sent Wang Keyi to Beijing and Tianjin to probe for intelligence. He repeatedly instructed Wang Keyi to find ways to establish an intelligence transportation network from Northeast to Shanghai, Shanghai to Taiwan, Hong Kong, and other places. Redmond's espionage activities after liberation were carried out under the leadership and support of the U.S. spy organization in Hong Kong. In September 1950 and January 1951, Redmond reported his activities in Shanghai to the U.S. spy organization in Hong Kong through liaison Luo Shixiang, and obtained secret instructions and activity funds of US$2,000.

The above-mentioned criminal facts have been confessed by the defendant Redmond. The confiscated transceivers, secret writing developer pills, intelligence personnel salary bills written by Redmond himself, telegram drafts, intelligence instructions, and other evidence, as well as the confessions of Wang Keyi, Luo Shixiang, Wu Weilan, Xu Bin, and others, confirm the facts. In accordance with Article 6, Paragraph 1; Article 7, Paragraphs 1, 2, and 3; and Article 17 of the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, he is sentenced to life imprisonment and confiscation of all his property in Shanghai.

2. Defendant Wang Keyi, alias He Shunfei, spy code Farmingdale, professional agent. He served as the "Guidance Specialist for Industrial and Commercial Movements of the Beining Railway of the Ministry of Social Affairs" of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit regime, and the "Leader of the Jidong Espionage Group of the First War Zone Commander's Headquarters," specializing in sabotaging the worker's movement along the Beining Line and Pinggu Line, and in Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, Majiagou, and other places. He also collected military and political intelligence about our liberated areas in Jidong, Taihang, and Taiyue. In 1945, the defendant began to collude with American spies and engaged in treasonous activities. He supplied the "American Strategic Intelligence Bureau" (O.S.S.) stationed in Chongqing at the time with the military and political intelligence he had collected about our liberated areas over the past eight years and participated in the spy organization. In April 1946, he transferred to the Army Strategic Intelligence Unit (S.S.U.), an American spy organization in Tianjin, and was sent to Changchun by James Kelles, the person in charge of the unit, to set up a radio station, and successively developed intelligence organizations to collect military intelligence about our liberated areas in Harbin, Qiqihar, Jiamusi, and other places, as well as military intelligence about the Soviet troops stationed in the Lushun-Dalian area, and reported directly to Tianjin. In May 1947, Wang Keyi was transferred to Shenyang and was led by Nels J.L. Benson and John Chrislaw, American spies in Shenyang. It was found that the intelligence supplied by the defendant Wang Keyi to American spies during his time in the Northeast was very extensive. Among the 276 intelligence drafts seized by us, there were important pieces of intelligence such as the "Summary of the Military and Political Situation of the Communist Army in Qiqihar," the "Situation of the Food Conference in Nenjiang," the "Enemy Situation in Wangyemiao," the "Military Deployment of the Communist Army in Jiamusi," and the "Overview of the Xiaofengman Power Plant." In May 1948, the defendant came to Shanghai with Chrislaw and was led by Bonald Metz, an American spy at the Shanghai General Station of the "44th Overseas Observation Detachment," and later transferred to the control of Redmond, continuing to supply intelligence. In March 1949, Wang Keyi received transceivers and codebooks from Redmond and, together with radio operator Xu Bin, engaged in a series of radio station reporting activities before and after the liberation of Shanghai. He frequently contacted Redmond, accepted his espionage activity instructions, continuously supplied intelligence, and in November 1949, he went to Beijing and Tianjin to probe for our military and political intelligence. In total, Wang Keyi supplied Redmond with intelligence after liberation, including: "Name List of Key Personnel Under the Beijing Municipal People's Government," "The Attitudes of the People of Beijing Towards the Communist Party, the United States, and the Soviet Union in the Past and Present," "Runway Conditions at Jiangwan and Dachang Airports in Shanghai," and "Names and Resumes of Key Personnel of the East China Military and Political Committee," and received more than US$4,200 in espionage activity funds from Redmond.

Defendant Wang Keyi not only colluded with Redmond, but when he lost contact with Redmond for some reason, he carried more than 30 pieces of important intelligence, including "Construction Situation of Dachang Airport in Shanghai" and "Air Defense Measures in Shanghai," to Hong Kong in December 1950. He reported to Consul Ralph Nelson Clough of the "U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong" and American spy Johnson, received instructions, and received US$3,600 in espionage activity funds and a call sign wavelength table. He returned to Shanghai in February 1951 to continue engaging in treasonous activities.

The defendant Wang Keyi has confessed to the above-mentioned criminal facts, and there are transceivers, codebooks, call sign wavelength tables, intelligence drafts, instructions from American spies, orders from the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary faction, and confessions from Redmond, Wu Weilan, Huang Huang, Xu Bin, and others as evidence. In accordance with Articles 3, Article 6, Paragraph 1, Article 7, Paragraphs 1, 2, and 3, and Article 17 of the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, he is sentenced to death with immediate execution. Except for necessary living materials for his family, all his property is confiscated.

3. Defendant Luo Shixiang joined the U.S. government's spy organization "44th Overseas Observation Detachment" in March 1949 and was ordered to engage in subversive activities in Shanghai. He bribed public officials within our agencies, stole and probed into state secrets, and served as a liaison between Redmond and Hong Kong. In addition to hiding radio stations for the spy organization and storing secret writing developer pills and lists of intelligence personnel, he successively bribed Ji Youkun and Ni Jingzhong, staff members of the Shanghai Customs, as intelligence agents in September 1949 and October 1950, actively engaging in treasonous activities. In June, August, October 1950, and January and March 1951, he carried confidential intelligence such as "Construction Situation of Dachang Airport," "Shanghai Financial Trends," "Campaign to Suppress Counter-Revolutionaries and Participate in Cadre Work," and "Northeast and North China Munitions Industry" to Hong Kong five times, handing them over to the U.S. spy organization in Hong Kong. After receiving instructions and returning to Shanghai, he plotted to develop spy organizations and instigate defections of our air force personnel in the Shanghai Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the Shanghai Railway Administration, the Shanghai Customs, and the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau. He received more than US$10,000 in espionage activity funds in total.

    事实暨理由
    一、被告雷德蒙，美国纽约人，曾参加美国陆军伞兵部队，一九四六年四月，在华盛顿美国政府间谍机关“陆军战略情报处”（War
　DepartmentStrategic　Services　Unit）间谍学校受训。一九四六年八月，被派遣来中国，化名斯特罗萨（JeromeStrother），工作代号尤克利特（Euclid），由美国政府间谍组织“第四十四海外观测队”上海总站分派至北京分站任译电员，后调沈阳分站工作，该被告以美军联络团（American　Liaison　Group）联络员名义，专事与蒋匪军事情报机构联系，逐日将所得有关我军事情报以电报转报“第四十四海外观测队”上海总站。一九四八年三月，该被告被调回上海总站，负责战况汇编工作。同年秋，又兼任情报组（Positive　Intelligence　Section）情报人员之训练和派遣工作。并将上海总站之另一美国间谍迈兹（Ronald　Metz）所领导的情报员被告王可一和沈阳分站站长辛乐甫（John　Singlaub）所领导的情报员丛克中先后划归其掌握，并对丛克中施以间谍训练，面授今后刺探情报之任务、方法及联络办法等，并发给半年间谍活动经费美钞二千五百元，着丛克中返回沈阳，利用辛乐甫交给他的潜伏电台进行间谍活动（按丛克中潜伏电台后移北京，已由我北京市人民政府公安局破获）一九四八年十月，雷德蒙又通过“第四十四海外观测队”上海总站反谍组（Counter　Intelligence　Section）美国间谍伟德尔（Ernest　Weidel）之关系，与原在旅顺之军统匪特辛祖祺取得联系，除当面向辛祖祺搜集旅顺港湾军事情报外，并施以摄影技术等训练。于一九四八年十二月，拨给辛祖祺间谍用小型照相机二架，软片六卷，活动经费美钞七百五十元，命其从速赶回旅顺，从事偷摄旅顺港湾海防设施、空军基地等活动。（按：辛祖祺已为我旅大市人民政府公安局捕获）。
    一九四九年春，我人民解放军进逼长江，当时由美国远东情报负责人劳埃·乔治（Lloyd　George）亲自向雷德蒙布置潜伏任务，继由“第四十四海外观测队”上海总站情报组负责人柯克（Robert　Koke）指示雷德蒙领导王可一、丛克中两个潜伏组（均配有电台），并要其在上海与台湾之间建立情报交通网，发展更多的情报人员，在解放后继续搜集我军政情报。柯克并在上海美商海宁生洋行（HenningsenProduce　Co．）为雷德蒙觅得掩护职业，并拨给间谍活动经费美钞一万元。雷德蒙接受任务后，即积极布置潜伏活动，供给王可一潜伏电台使用之收发报机三具、密码本十六本，督促王可一及报务员徐斌试通电台，收罗吴薇兰为翻译，出资租顶公寓，以作潜伏活动之用。上海解放后，雷德蒙策谋与丛克中潜伏组电台恢复联系，同时将其所搜集之情报亲拟电稿指使王可一进行通报。一九四九年十一月，该被告又派遣王可一潜去北京、天津进行刺探情报活动；并一再指使王可一设法建立东北至上海，上海至台湾、香港等地之情报交通网。雷德蒙在解放后的间谍活动，是在美国在香港的间谍组织的领导与支持之下进行的。一九五○年九月及一九五一年一月，雷德蒙通过联络人被告罗世祥，向美国在香港的间谍组织报告其在沪活动情况，并取得秘密指示及活动经费美钞二千元。
