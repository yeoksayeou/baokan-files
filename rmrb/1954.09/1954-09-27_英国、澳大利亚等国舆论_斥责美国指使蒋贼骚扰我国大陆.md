British, Australian and Other Countries' Public Opinion
    Condemns the US for Instigating Chiang Kai-shek to Harass Our Mainland

    英　国 [England]
    The National Committee of the Britain-China Friendship Association passed an emergency resolution on the 18th, strongly protesting the United States' interference in China by means of aiding the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.
    The resolution stated: Recently, these attacks carried out with US assistance have reached an alarming degree. For almost two weeks, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops, flying American-made planes, have been constantly bombing, dropping napalm bombs, and strafing Xiamen and its neighboring areas, killing residents. American newspapers have announced that the US Seventh Fleet has been ordered to provide "full logistical support" for these attacks, despite the risk of events that could lead to an expanded war and the destruction of the favorable results of the Geneva Conference.
    The resolution requested the British government to immediately lodge a protest with the US government and the United Nations Organization, demanding the immediate withdrawal of the US Seventh Fleet from Chinese waters, and demanding that the US end all interference in Chinese affairs.

    澳大利亚 [Australia]
    The Australian "Tribune" published an editorial on September 15th titled "The Whole World Recognizes Taiwan as Chinese," stating that Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang's continuous bombing of Xiamen draws attention to this major threat to peace in the Pacific region. The aircraft, bombs, and napalm bombs used in these attacks on China are all made in the United States. In fact, since their war plans suffered a major defeat at the Geneva Conference, American imperialists have been intensifying their aggression and provocative actions against mainland China from the island of Taiwan. They are pursuing a policy of constantly maintaining a state of war along the Chinese coast. These provocative activities are a serious threat to world peace. The editorial pointed out that the fact that Taiwan is part of China has long been recognized internationally. The US government must withdraw from Taiwan and other Chinese coastal islands, and must stop supporting Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang.
    The "Guardian" also published a commentary on the 16th, calling on Australians to demand that the US government immediately withdraw from Taiwan. The commentary emphasized that the situation in Taiwan powerfully illustrates the urgent need to end the intolerable situation of depriving a major country of 600 million people of its legitimate status in the United Nations. The People's Republic of China must obtain its seat in the United Nations. The commentary said that the most opportune moment has arrived, and the Australian government should end the unrealistic attitude taken in our current relations with China. Immediate measures must be taken to exchange diplomatic missions with the People's Republic of China.

    奥地利 [Austria]
    The Austrian newspaper "Volksstimme" published an editorial on the 18th titled "The Bandit Nest on Taiwan Island," denouncing the US for instigating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to carry out provocative actions against mainland China.
    The editorial said that after the victory of the People's Republic of China, the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek regime, with their remaining troops, and of course with the gold of the Chinese National Bank and other looted valuables, found refuge in Taiwan, hoping to establish mercenary troops with the help of the US fleet, dollars, and American weapons, and attack the People's Republic of China. Therefore, in reality, this so-called Kuomintang China, manufactured by the United States, is nothing more than a small group of remnants and bandits relying on US dollars and equipped with American weapons. The editorial said that the US rulers are not generous people, but extremely stubborn merchants. They want to make a profit from the money they pay to Chiang Kai-shek and his running dogs in Taiwan, and in American policy, this profit means bloodshed and war. The editorial said: The bandits in Taiwan are a dangerous threat to peace.
    The editorial said that the American newspapers' propaganda about "Communist aggression" cannot deceive anyone. The fact is that the American-backed remnant bandits in Taiwan are beginning to carry out aggression against the People's Republic of China. Only when Taiwan and other islands are liberated can peace be guaranteed in this part of the world. (Xinhua News Agency dispatch)

    英国、澳大利亚等国舆论
    斥责美国指使蒋贼骚扰我国大陆
    英　国
    英中友好协会全国委员会扩大会议十八日通过了一项紧急决议，强烈抗议美国以援助蒋匪帮的手段对中国进行干涉。
    决议说：近来这些在美国援助下进行的攻击已达到惊人的程度。差不多两个星期以来，蒋匪军驾驶的美制飞机一直不断地对厦门和它的邻近地区进行轰炸、投掷凝固汽油弹和扫射，杀害居民。美国报纸曾宣布说，美国第七舰队已奉命给予这些攻击以“充分的后勤支援”，尽管这样做有可能造成扩大战争和破坏日内瓦会议的有利结果的事件的危险。
    决议要求英国政府立即向美国政府和联合国组织提出抗议，要求立即把美国第七舰队撤出中国海面，并要求美国终止对中国事务的一切干涉。
    澳大利亚
    澳大利亚“论坛报”九月十五日以“全世界都承认台湾是中国的”为题发表社论说，蒋介石匪帮不断轰炸厦门，使人们集中注意这种对太平洋区域和平的主要威胁。对中国进行的这些攻击中所使用的飞机、炸弹和凝固汽油弹都是美国制造的。事实上，美帝国主义者自从他们的战争计划在日内瓦会议上遭到重大的失败以来，一直在从台湾岛加紧对中国大陆进行侵略和加紧挑衅行动。他们正在奉行一种使中国沿海不断保持战争活动状态的政策。这些挑衅活动是对世界和平的严重威胁。社论指出，台湾是中国的一部分这个事实，很久以来就得到了国际的承认。美国政府必须退出台湾和其他中国沿海的岛屿，必须停止支持蒋介石匪帮。
    “卫报”也在十六日发表评论，号召澳大利亚人要求美国政府立即退出台湾。评论强调说，在台湾发生的局势有力地说明，急需结束剥夺六亿人口的一个大国在联合国中的合法地位的令人不能容忍的情况。中华人民共和国必须在联合国取得它的席位。评论说，现在最适宜的时机已到，澳大利亚政府应当结束我们目前和中国的关系中所采取的不现实的态度。必须立即采取措施，和中华人民共和国交换外交使团。
    奥地利
    奥地利报纸“奥地利人民之声报”十八日以“台湾岛上的匪巢”为题发表社论，斥责美国指使蒋介石卖国集团对中国大陆进行挑衅行动。
    社论说，在中华人民共和国胜利以后，蒋介石政权的残余分子带着他们的残余军队，当然也带着中国国家银行的金子和劫掠来的其他贵重物品，在台湾找到了藏身之处，希图通过美国舰队、美元和美国武器的帮助，建立雇佣军队，向中华人民共和国进攻。所以，实际上，这个美国制造的所谓国民党中国，不过是一小撮靠美元和以美国武器装备起来的残匪罢了。社论说，美国统治者们并不是什么好施舍的人，而是些极端顽固的商人。他们要从他们付给蒋介石和他的在台湾的走狗的金钱中，赚取利润，而在美国政策中，这种利润意味着流血和战争。社论说：台湾的匪徒就是对和平的危险的威胁。
    社论说，美国报纸关于“共产党侵略”的宣传是欺骗不了任何人的。事实是，在台湾的美国支持的残余匪帮正在开始对中华人民共和国进行侵略。只有台湾和其他岛屿获得解放，才能保障世界这部分地区的和平。　（据新华社讯）
