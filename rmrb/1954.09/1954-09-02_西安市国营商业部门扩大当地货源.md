    Xi'an's state-owned commercial purchasing and supply departments, after emphasizing the organization of local sources of goods, have transformed the supply of certain major materials needed by people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest region from relying entirely or mostly on imports from other regions to being supplied entirely or mostly by local production. Nine types of cotton cloth, including white cloth, vulcanized cloth, red cloth, sauce-colored cloth, and vulcanized blue cloth, and deep shilin cloth, are now entirely supplied by production within the region. Seven types of cotton cloth, including flower gabardine, An'an blue cloth, light shilin cloth, and Haichang blue cloth, which were not produced in the Northwest region in the past, now have local production accounting for more than half of the total sales in the region. In terms of general merchandise, in addition to a significant increase in the number of locally manufactured towels, matches, socks, cloth shoes, various leather shoes, and leather hats compared to last year, locally produced enamelware has also increased from about 30% of the total sales in the region last year to more than 70% this year. In terms of variety, because state-owned commercial departments can promptly convey consumer feedback to local production departments, and various production departments can also promptly pay attention to adapting to the needs of local consumers and improving production.
    In order to make the supply of autumn and winter goods more abundant, the Northwest Regional Company of the China General Merchandise Company has added more than ten new categories of autumn and winter goods to its local purchases this year, including cotton and woolen clothing, knitted woolen clothing, woolen vests, and velvet thread woven caps favored by Northwest women. The number of locally processed scarves has increased by more than three times compared to last year, brushed wool socks and thick thread socks have increased by about six times compared to last year, and various cotton and woolen hats have increased by more than twenty times compared to last year.

    西安市国营商业部门扩大当地货源
    西安市国营商业各采购供应部门重视组织当地货源后，西北区各族人民生活需要的某些主要物资，已由过去全部或大部依靠外区进货，变成全部或大部由当地生产供应。白布、硫化元布、红布、酱布、硫化蓝布、深士林布等九种棉布，现在已全部由区内生产供应；过去西北地区不生产的花哔叽、安安蓝布、浅士林布、海昌蓝布等七种棉布，现在区内生产的已占全区销售量的一半以上。百货中除当地制造的毛巾、火柴、袜子、布鞋和各种皮鞋、皮帽等的进货数量比去年增加很多外，当地生产的搪瓷品也由去年占全区销售总量的百分之三十左右，上升到今年的百分之七十以上。在品种方面，由于国营商业部门能将消费者的意见及时反映给当地生产部门，各生产部门也能及时注意适应当地消费者的需要，改进生产。
    为了使秋冬季商品供应更加充足，中国百货公司西北区公司今年在当地进货中新增加的秋冬季商品，就有棉布和呢料服装、毛线编织衣裤、毛织背心和西北妇女喜爱的丝绒线织便帽等十多类。在当地加工的围巾数量比去年增加了三倍多，冲毛袜和厚线袜比去年增加了六倍左右，各种棉、呢帽子比去年增加了二十倍以上。（新华社）
