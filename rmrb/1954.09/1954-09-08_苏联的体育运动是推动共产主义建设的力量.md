Soviet Sports Are a Force for Promoting Communist Construction
He Long

(I)

The Chinese sports delegation was invited to the Soviet Union to participate in the 1954 All-Union Sports Festival. We left Beijing on July 13th and returned on August 17th, spending one month and two days in the Soviet Union, excluding travel time. Several other countries and international sports organizations were also invited to participate in this sports festival.

The grand and magnificent sports review held at the "Dynamo" Stadium in Moscow on July 18th left a very deep impression on people. More than 30,000 athletes participated in dozens of collective performances and individual competitions, compactly, harmoniously, and orderly displaying a large garden of youth and happiness to nearly 100,000 spectators. In these performances, we saw the rich and colorful content of Soviet sports and the high technical achievements of Soviet athletes. Athletes from various republics wore their national costumes, manipulated various combined sports equipment, and made complex and beautiful movements. Famous artists and musicians made artistic designs and matched music for each performance according to national characteristics, so that every change of color and every gush of fountain became an artistic component of these performances. The entire review was completed within four hours according to plan. This demonstrated the outstanding organizational work of Soviet sports workers, as well as the high organization, discipline, and collectivist spirit of Soviet athletes. In particular, the broad masses of working people actively supported and participated in the preparation for this sports review. This is a force, a huge creative force of the Soviet people manifested by the prosperous development of Soviet economy and culture and the strong unity between all nationalities. The "Pravda" editorial called this day "a holiday for the whole people."

We also visited Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Sochi, Tbilisi, and other cities, visiting the main buildings, universities, and museums, various types of large and small sports venues, parks, and cultural palaces; we visited the sports committees of the Soviet government at all levels and the sports organizations of factories and collective farms, amateur sports schools for children and young people, the Moscow Aviation Club, and the Leningrad Sports Science Research Institute. We also visited the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition and the Rural Sports Exhibition Hall in it. All these visits have continued to deepen our understanding of Soviet sports and have deepened the profound friendship between Chinese and Soviet sports workers, athletes, and the people of the two countries.

(II)

The first impression of Soviet sports is that the mass character of Soviet sports has developed to a national scale. In the past, Tsarist Russia had only 55,000 athletes and two or three sports organizations. The great October Socialist Revolution opened up broad avenues for the development of Soviet sports. Now, as the Soviet Union moves forward on the road of communist construction, there are millions of athletes and sports workers in cities and villages. Men, women, old and young, all show great interest and love for sports. Every competition attracts thousands of spectators. Sports have truly become the cause of the whole people and an indispensable part of the daily life of every worker. The Moscow Stalin Automobile Factory, in addition to those who generally participate in radio gymnastics, has about 8,000 employees who regularly engage in 32 sports. In this one factory alone, 6,000 athletes of different levels and 40 master athletes have been trained in the past five years. In 1953, the grassroots sports organizations in the Soviet countryside had developed to 62,700, with more than 2.75 million athletes. The "Ready for Labor and Defense" sports system (referred to as the "TRP system") is widely promoted throughout the country. In all schools, physical education is a compulsory course. There are more than 5,000 physical education teachers in colleges and universities alone. In 1952, the Soviet government stipulated that college students must pass the second-level standard of the "TRP system" when completing the second-year course. In 1953, it was stipulated that graduates of ten-year schools must pass the first-level standard of the "TRP system," and graduates of seven-year schools must pass the junior-level standard of the "TRP system." Failure to pass physical education means you cannot graduate.

This "Ready for Labor and Defense" sports system plays a huge role in developing mass sports. It was initiated by the Soviet Lenin Communist Youth League in 1931. This system is divided into junior level (for youths aged 14 to 15), first level, and second level, with different items and standards. Its purpose is to comprehensively develop the Soviet people, especially Soviet youth, and to conduct patriotic education for them, making them healthy, brave, optimistic, loyal defenders of the motherland, and active builders of communism. This embodies the purpose of the Soviet sports cause more clearly. Therefore, whether it is sports in industrial and mining enterprises and collective farms, physical education classes in schools, or extracurricular physical exercises, all are centered on the standards of the "TRP system" at all levels. In order to ensure that all athletes have the conditions to engage in labor and defend the motherland, the Soviet government also stipulates that they must pass the "TRP system" test before obtaining the title of athlete at all levels. Chess players are no exception. This advanced sports system is extremely popular among the Soviet people, especially Soviet youth. The number of people who have obtained medals through the "TRP system" at all levels is increasing dramatically every year. Our country and other people's democratic countries also use this advanced sports system as a model to learn from, actively creating conditions to promote it in their own countries.

(III)

On the basis of such widespread development of sports, the ranks of Soviet athletes have continued to grow and have made significant achievements in continuously improving their technical level.

At the 15th International Olympic Games held in Helsinki in 1952, the Soviet Union's score exceeded the sum of the scores of Britain, France, Switzerland, Finland, and other countries that previously occupied a major position in European track and field sports, winning the first place in the overall score. In recent years, Soviet athletes have created 84 world records. At the forefront of the guard of honor of this year's sports review, led by the best Soviet sports coaches, was a long column composed of outstanding athletes from the World Championships, European Championships, and the 15th International Olympic Games, athletes who created world records, Soviet champions, and athletes who created new Soviet records.

The Soviet Union pays attention to selecting and training athletes from childhood. There are now 800 youth sports schools that use after-school time to train young athletes under the age of 18; there are 400 youth sports schools that train outstanding athletes over the age of 18 in their spare time. Many grassroots units and social organizations also run short-term training classes to train athletes and activists in large numbers. In order to systematically train sports cadres, the Soviet Union has 13 sports colleges, 37 sports technical schools, and sports departments in various normal colleges. Currently, there are more than 40,000 future sports experts studying in these schools. The three sports science research institutes established in Moscow, Leningrad, and Tbilisi are for conducting scientific research work and theoretically summarizing the advanced experience in sports and physical education. For example, the standards of the "TRP system" at all levels were formulated based on the results of their scientific research.

An important method to attract the masses to participate in sports activities and continuously improve their technical level is to regularly organize various competitions and make them a system. In 1954, a total of 170 All-Union competitions of various types were held separately in various parts of the Soviet Union, and nearly 200 international competitions have been or will be participated in. In addition, the Soviet Union sends dozens of sports delegations to visit various countries every year, and at the same time invites dozens of foreign sports delegations to visit the Soviet Union.

The Soviet Union also implements a strict athlete ranking system. According to the athlete's performance in various competitions and other aspects (such as labor attitude, academic performance, sportsmanship, etc.), after formal evaluation by national referees at the republic level or higher, the titles of third-level athlete, second-level athlete, first-level athlete, master athlete, and even meritorious athlete are awarded. In 1945, the Soviet government decided to award medals to Soviet champions and All-Union record holders. The "Dynamo" and "Spartak" sports associations, which have made special contributions to the development of sports and the training of athletes, have also won the Order of Lenin.

(IV)

The fact that Soviet sports have achieved such brilliant achievements in a relatively short period of time is inseparable from the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system, inseparable from the care of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government for sports, and inseparable from the great victory of the Soviet Communist Party leading the Soviet people to build a socialist society and move towards a communist society.

In the Soviet Union, the Party and the government regard sports as one of the important means of conducting communist education for the working people, and in particular, create all conditions to enable the younger generation to develop in an all-round way and become courageous, strong, resolute, alert, loyal to the cause of communism, believe in their own strength, and be able to overcome any difficulties. The Party and the government promote people's health, train people to participate in labor and defend the motherland through sports.

In order to realize the state's leadership in the sports cause, the Soviet Council of Ministers and even the governments of various republics and local governments at all levels have established sports committees. Sports committees at all levels rely on the relevant departments and broad social forces to realize their duties and plans. These social forces are mainly organized in various voluntary sports associations. The earliest sports association was the "Dynamo" sports association, established in 1923 under the advocacy of Dzerzhinsky. Now there are 28 such sports associations in the Soviet Union. In addition to the five sports associations of "Dynamo," "Spartak," "Labor Reserves," collective farms, and the Soviet Army, the remaining 23 sports associations belong to the trade union system (which is further divided into industries, such as railways, miners, automobile and tractor manufacturing, etc.). These associations have many members and their own organizational system from the grassroots to the All-Union level, elect their own leadership through members' meetings or congresses, and have their own sports venues and sports equipment. For example, the sports association of the Ukrainian trade union system has more than one million members, 124 comprehensive sports fields, 10,000 various ball courts, 75 swimming pools, and 48 gymnasiums; the Ukrainian collective farm sports association has had 600,000 people pass the first and second-level standards of the "TRP system" and trained 100,000 people to obtain the title of athlete since its establishment in 1950. We visited their indoor, outdoor, and aquatic sports facilities in the Stalin Automobile Factory in Moscow and the Lenin Collective Farm in Kiev. Except for sports in schools, which is led by the government's Ministry of Education, almost all the practical work, especially sports activities at the grassroots level, is organized by these sports associations. These mass voluntary sports associations can be said to be the foundation and pillar of Soviet sports.

(V)

Soviet trade union organizations and the Lenin Communist Youth League have done tremendous work in developing sports.

The various sports associations of the trade union system have united most of the Soviet athletes. Trade union organizations not only educate athletes with patriotism and infinite loyalty to the cause of communist construction, but also widely use sports as an important means to improve the health of workers and prevent occupational diseases. The funds used by trade unions in developing sports accounted for 14% of the total expenditure of trade unions in 1953, and increased to more than 20% of the total expenditure in 1954. Trade unions have various sports venues and sports equipment. There are 1,200 large and small sports fields, 55,000 gymnasiums, aquatic sports stations, ski stations, travel bases, and mountaineering camps belonging to the trade union system throughout the Soviet Union.

The Communist Youth League has been called "the soul of sports." In fact, the work and role of the Communist Youth League in developing sports is far more than this. The Communist Youth League organization calls on its members to lead the broad masses of young people to strive to pass the "TRP system" standards with their exemplary actions; in every corner, through various methods, it carries out extensive publicity and explanation work from all aspects to mobilize young people to actively participate in sports. The Communist Youth League clearly stipulates its task is to fully mobilize the strength of young people to ensure the completion of the government's work plan, and to unite and educate the younger generation through sports. The Communist Youth League organization and the Sports Committee maintain close contact and work together. The Communist Youth League also pays attention to mobilizing young people to participate in voluntary labor and build venues themselves. The voluntary labor organized by the Communist Youth League played a great role in the construction of the garden-like "Kirov" stadium in Leningrad, which can accommodate 100,000 spectators. The young people have spent their labor on these venues, so they cherish these venues more and actively participate in all activities on these venues. In addition to the planned construction of large-scale, well-equipped stadiums, the Soviet Union especially attaches great importance to using existing sports equipment, or using natural conditions, simply repairing them. For example, Leningrad has a fully equipped winter stadium, which was transformed from an old garage. Others, such as a simple aquatic sports station built by a pond or a small river in the countryside, a simple sports field built on an open space, cost little and have great results. They manage these simple venues as carefully as they manage those large stadiums, and each venue can be fully used to organize exercises or training according to plan, not just used when the sports meeting is held; the same is true for other constructions, never abandoning the old when there is a new one or trying to change everything at once.

(VI)

Soviet sports, as a tool to promote socialist construction and a component of socialist construction, has finally reached today's scale and level after more than 30 years of arduous and tenacious struggle.

As early as 1919, during the serious period of the civil war and the opposition to imperialist armed intervention, the Soviet Union held the first military sports festival, setting an example for holding large-scale sports reviews in the future. Lenin said in his speech at this festival: "Today's festival shows what achievements we have reached and what new forces are growing within the working class." During the economic recovery period, sports developed greatly because they were led by the factory clubs of the trade unions. In 1922, Moscow and Leningrad began to establish sports technical schools, and sports affairs committees of various republics were also established successively. In 1925, according to the decision of the Party Central Committee, sports were made a part of national education. Due to the proposal of the Communist Youth League, the "TRP system" was implemented starting in 1931. With the more extensive development of sports, the Soviet government formally established the All-Union Sports Committee under the People's Committee in 1936 and proposed to widely establish sports associations in various systems. In 1939, the Soviet government decided to make the third Sunday of July every year the All-Union Sports Festival and stipulate it as a holiday for the whole people. The Great Patriotic War tested the role of Soviet sports. Stalin pointed out in an order issued in 1943: "Experience has proved that a Red Army soldier must not only have a high degree of moral and military cultivation, but also a high degree of physical cultivation, otherwise he cannot successfully complete the tasks he is required to undertake at present."

The Soviet Communist Party educates Soviet athletes, sports workers, and all the people not to be satisfied with the achievements they have already made, but to continue to move forward. The resolution of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party on sports in December 1948 pointed out: "Our main task is to do everything possible to further develop the mass character of Soviet sports, improve the sports technology of millions of athletes, and on this basis, enable Soviet athletes to win world championships and break world records in major events in the near future." In 1952, the resolution of the 19th National Congress of the Soviet Communist Party once again proposed to ensure the further development of Soviet sports. Now, Soviet sports workers and athletes are striving to live up to the expectations of the Party and the people and continue to move towards more ambitious goals.

Like other work, our country must learn from the Soviet Union in sports in a practical and serious manner. Sports is a particularly young undertaking in our young country. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we must take the great Soviet Union as an example, work practically, study tenaciously, and only after a long period of arduous efforts can we talk about achievements. There must be no fluke mentality.

During this period of time with the Soviet people, we deeply felt that the Soviet people love our people and our great leader Chairman Mao, have great confidence in our country's realization of socialism, and are willing to do everything possible to help us in our country's sports and other work. We will never forget these days, and this memory will always encourage us to make achievements in our work, so that our work can play a greater role in promoting our country's construction and strengthening the sacred struggle to defend the motherland.

    苏联的体育运动是推动共产主义建设的力量
  　贺龙
    （一）
    中国体育代表团应邀赴苏参加一九五四年全苏体育节，七月十三日离京，八月十七日返国。旅途之外，在苏联为时一月零两天。应邀参加这次体育节的还有几十个其他国家和国际体育组织的代表团。
    七月十八日在莫斯科“狄纳莫”运动场举行的盛大壮丽的体育检阅，给人们以十分深刻的印象。三万多名运动员参加的几十项集体表演和个人竞赛，紧凑地和谐地有条不紊地向将近十万观众展示出一座表现青春和幸福的大花园。在这些表演中，我们看到了苏联体育运动丰富多采的内容和苏联运动员高度的技术成就。各个加盟共和国的运动员都穿着本民族的服装，操纵着各式的联合运动器械，作出复杂而优美的动作。有名的艺术家和音乐家按照民族特点分别为各场表演作出艺术设计和配上乐曲，使得每一种颜色的变幻，每一股喷泉的涌出，都成为这些表演的艺术性的组成部分。整个检阅完全按照计划在四小时以内进行完毕。这表现了苏联体育工作者卓越的组织工作，也表现了苏联运动员的高度组织性、纪律性和集体主义精神，特别是广大劳动人民都积极支持和参加了这次体育检阅的准备工作。这是一种力量，这是苏联经济文化发展繁荣和各民族之间坚强团结所表现出来的苏联人民的巨大创造力量。“真理报”社论把这一天称为“全民的节日”。
    我们又先后在莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅、索契、第比里斯等城市进行了参观和访问，参观了这几个城市的主要建筑、大学和博物馆，各种类型的大小运动场地、公园和文化宫；访问了苏联各级政府的体育运动委员会和工厂集体农庄的体育组织，少年的和青年的业余体育学校，莫斯科航空俱乐部和列宁格勒体育科学研究院。我们还参观了全苏农业展览会和其中的农村体育运动展览馆。所有这些参观和访问，都继续加深我们对苏联体育运动事业的认识，并且加深中苏两国体育工作者、运动员和两国人民的深厚友谊。
      （二）
    对于苏联的体育运动事业的第一个印象，就是苏联体育运动的群众性已经发展到全民的规模。过去沙皇俄国只有五万五千名运动员和两三个体育组织。伟大的十月社会主义革命为苏联体育运动开辟了广阔发展的道路。到现在，当苏联在共产主义建设大道上向前迈进的时期，城市和乡村的运动员和体育工作者达数百万人。男女老少都对体育运动表现极高的兴趣和热爱，每次比赛都吸引成千上万的观众。体育运动真正成为全民的事业，成为每个劳动者日常生活中不可缺少的部分。莫斯科斯大林汽车工厂除了一般参加广播体操的以外，有八千名左右职工经常从事三十二项运动的锻炼。就在这一个工厂里，五年来培养了六千名不同等级的运动员和四十名运动健将。一九五三年，苏联农村的基层体育组织已经发展到六万二千七百个，运动员二百七十五万余人。“准备劳动与卫国”体育制度（简称“劳卫制”）在全国普遍推行。在所有的学校里，体育都是必修课程。只是在高等学校的体育教师就有五千多人。苏联政府于一九五二年规定：高等学校学生在学完二年级课程时必须通过“劳卫制”二级标准。一九五三年又规定：十年制学校毕业的学生就必须通过“劳卫制”一级标准，七年制学校毕业生必须通过“劳卫制”少年级标准。体育不及格就不能毕业。
    这种“准备劳动与卫国”体育制度对于开展群众性的体育运动起着巨大的作用。这是一九三一年由苏联列宁共产主义青年团倡议推行的。这个制度分为少年级（十四岁到十五岁的少年参加）、一级和二级，项目和标准各有不同，其目的是使苏联人民，首先是苏联青年，身体全面发展，并对他们进行爱国主义教育，使之成为健康的勇敢的乐观的祖国忠实保卫者和共产主义积极建设者。这就把苏联体育运动事业的目的更加明确地体现出来了，所以无论工矿企业和集体农庄的体育运动，学校的体育课和课外的体育锻炼，都是以“劳卫制”各级标准为中心内容。为了保证各项运动选手都要具备从事劳动和保卫祖国的条件，苏联政府还规定：获得各级运动员的称号之前，必须通过“劳卫制”测验。象棋选手也不能例外。这种先进的体育制度极受苏联人民特别是苏联青年的欢迎，获得通过“劳卫制”各级奖章的人数每年都激剧增加；我国和各人民民主国家也都以这种先进的体育制度作为学习的榜样，积极创造条件在本国推行。
    （三）
    在体育运动这样广泛发展的基础上，苏联运动员的队伍不断地壮大起来，并在不断提高技术水平方面获得重大成就。
    一九五二年在赫尔辛基举行的第十五届国际奥林匹克运动会上，苏联得分超过了先前在欧洲田径运动中占主要地位的英、法、瑞士、芬兰等国得分的总和荣膺总分第一名。近几年来，苏联运动员创造了八十四项世界纪录。在今年体育检阅的仪仗队最前头，由苏联最优秀的体育教练率领着的，就是世界冠军赛、欧洲冠军赛与第十五届国际奥林匹克运动会的优胜运动员、创造世界纪录的运动员、苏联冠军和创造全苏新纪录的运动员所组成的长列纵队。
    苏联从儿童时代就注意挑选和培养运动员。现在有八百所少年体育学校，利用课余时间培养十八岁以下的少年运动员；有四百所青年体育学校，在业余时间训练十八岁以上的优秀运动员。许多基层单位和社会团体还开办短期训练班，大批培养运动员和积极分子。为了系统地培养体育工作干部，苏联设有十三个体育学院，三十七所体育专科学校，并在各个师范学院设立体育系。目前在这些学校学习的有四万多名未来的体育专家。在莫斯科、列宁格勒和第比里斯设立的三所体育科学研究院，则是为的进行科学研究工作，把体育运动和体育教学方面的先进经验从理论上加以总结。比如“劳卫制”的各级标准就是根据他们科学研究的结果制订的。
    吸引广大群众参加体育活动和不断提高技术水平的一个重要方法，就是经常组织各种竞赛并使之形成一种制度。一九五四年内，在苏联各地分头举行的全苏性的各类竞赛共达一百七十次，已经参加和将要参加的国际竞赛近二百次。此外，苏联每年都派出几十个体育代表团去各国访问，同时邀请几十个外国的体育代表团去访问苏联。
    在苏联还实行严格的运动员等级制度。根据运动员参加各级竞赛的成绩和其他方面（如劳动态度、学习成绩、体育道德等）的表现，经过共和国一级或更高的国家裁判员正式评定，分别给予三级运动员、二级运动员、一级运动员、运动健将以至功勋运动员的称号。一九四五年，苏联政府决定授予苏联冠军和全苏纪录保持者以奖章。在开展体育运动和培养运动员方面有过特殊贡献的“狄纳莫”和“斯巴达克”两个体育协会还得过列宁勋章。
      （四）
    苏联的体育运动能够在较短的时间以内，获得如此辉煌的成就，是与社会主义制度的无比优越性分不开的，是与苏联共产党和苏联政府对体育运动的关怀分不开的，是与苏联共产党领导苏联人民建成社会主义社会并向共产主义社会迈进的伟大胜利分不开的。
    在苏联，党和政府把体育运动看作是对劳动人民进行共产主义教育的重要手段之一，特别为使青年一代能够全面发展，成为勇敢健壮、坚毅机警、忠于共产主义事业、相信自己的力量、能够克服任何困难的人而创造出一切条件。党和政府通过体育运动来增进人民健康，训练人民参加劳动和保卫祖国。
    为了实现国家对体育运动事业的领导，苏联部长会议以至各共和国和各级地方政府都设立体育运动委员会。各级体育运动委员会则依靠各有关部门和广泛的社会力量来实现自己的职责和计划。这些社会力量主要都组织在各个志愿体育协会里面。最早的一个体育协会是在一九二三年，在捷尔任斯基倡导下建立的“狄纳莫”体育协会。现在苏联共有二十八个这样的体育协会，除“狄纳莫”、“斯巴达克”、“劳动后备军”、集体农庄和苏军等五个体育协会以外，其余二十三个体育协会都属于工会系统（其中又分行业，如铁路、矿工、汽车与拖拉机制造业等）。这些协会都有很多会员和自己从基层到全苏的一套组织系统，经过会员大会或代表大会选举自己的领导机构，并拥有自己的运动场地和体育设备。如乌克兰工会系统的体育协会有一百多万会员，有一百二十四个综合性的运动场，一万个各种球场，七十五个游泳池，四十八个体育馆；乌克兰集体农庄体育协会自一九五○年成立以来，已有六十万人通过“劳卫制”一级和二级标准，培养出十万人得到运动员称号。我们在莫斯科的斯大林汽车工厂和基辅的列宁集体农庄，都参观了他们室内的、露天的和水上的体育设备。除了学校里的体育运动由政府的教育部负责领导以外，几乎全部的实际工作，尤其是基层单位的体育活动，都是由这些体育协会负责组织的。这些群众性的志愿体育协会，可以说是苏联体育运动的基础和支柱。
      （五）
    苏联的工会组织和列宁共产主义青年团在开展体育运动方面进行了巨大的工作。
    工会系统的各个体育协会把苏联的大部分运动员都团结起来了。工会组织不仅以爱国主义精神和对于共产主义建设事业的无限忠诚去教育运动员，并且广泛地利用体育运动作为改进劳动者的健康状况和预防职业病的一种重要手段。工会用在开展体育运动方面的经费，一九五三年占工会全部开支百分之十四，一九五四年增加到占全部开支百分之二十以上。工会有各种运动场地和体育设备。苏联全国属于工会系统的有一千二百个大小运动场，五万五千个体操室、水上运动站、滑雪站、旅行基地和登山运动营。
    共青团曾被称为“体育运动的灵魂”。实际上，共青团在开展体育运动方面的工作和作用是远不止于此的。共青团组织号召团员以自己的模范行动带动广大青年群众争取通过“劳卫制”标准；在各个角落，通过各种方式，从各方面进行广泛的宣传解释工作，发动青年积极参加体育运动。共青团明确地规定自己的任务，是充分动员青年的力量来保证政府工作计划的完成，并通过体育运动来团结和教育青年一代。共青团组织和体育运动委员会经常保持密切联系并共同工作。共青团还注意发动青年参加义务劳动，自己动手建设场地。列宁格勒可容十万观众的花园一般的“基洛夫”运动场建筑工程中，共青团所组织的义务劳动起了很大作用。青年们在这些场地上花费了自己的劳动，也就更加爱护这些场地，并积极参加这些场地上的一切活动。苏联除有计划地建筑规模巨大、设备完善的体育场以外，尤其十分重视利用现有体育设备，或利用自然条件，简单加以修葺。例如列宁格勒有一个设备齐全的冬季运动场，就是利用一个旧汽车库改造的。其他如农村一个池塘或小河边修一个简单的水上运动站，一块空地上修一个简单的运动场，所费不多，收效很大。他们管理这些简陋的场地和管理那些大运动场一样的认真，每个场地都能充分使用，有计划地组织练习或训练，并不是仅仅在开运动会时才使用；其他建设也是如此，决不是有了新的就丢了旧的或是百废俱兴，企图一下子全面改观。
      （六）
    苏联的体育运动，作为推动社会主义建设的工具和社会主义建设的一个组成部分，经过三十多年艰苦顽强的斗争，终于达到今天的规模和水平。
    远在一九一九年，正当国内战争和反对帝国主义武装干涉的严重时期，苏联举行了第一届军事体育节，为以后举行大规模体育检阅树立了范例。列宁在这次节日发表演说时就说道：“今天的节日表明，我们已经达到了怎样的成就，工人阶级内部增长着怎样的新生力量。”经济恢复时期，体育运动因为由工会的工厂俱乐部来领导而有较大的发展。 一九二二年，莫斯科和列宁格勒开始建立体育专科学校，各加盟共和国体育运动事务委员会也相继成立。一九二五年，根据党中央的决议把体育作为国民教育的一部分。由于共青团的建议，自一九三一年开始实行“劳卫制”。在体育运动更加广泛开展的情况下，苏联政府于一九三六年在人民委员会下正式设立全苏体育运动委员会，并提出在各系统广泛建立体育协会。一九三九年，苏联政府决定以每年七月的第三个星期日为全苏体育节，并规定为全民的节日。伟大的卫国战争考验了苏联体育运动的作用。斯大林在一九四三年发布的一项命令中曾经指出：“经验证明，一个红军战士不仅要有高度的道德、军事修养，而且要有高度的体育修养，否则是不能胜利完成当前所需要担任的任务的。”
    苏联共产党教育苏联运动员、体育工作者和全体人民不要满足于已有的成绩，而要继续前进。一九四八年十二月，苏联共产党中央通过的关于体育运动的决议指出：“我们主要的任务，就是要尽一切可能进一步地发展苏联体育运动的群众性，提高数百万运动员的运动技术，并在这个基础上，使苏联运动员于最近几年内获得世界冠军和在主要项目方面打破世界纪录。”一九五二年，苏联共产党第十九次代表大会决议中再次提出要保证苏联体育运动进一步的发展。现在苏联的体育工作者和运动员们正努力使自己不辜负党和人民的期望，并继续向着更远大的目标前进。
    和其他工作一样，我国在体育运动方面必须切实地认真地向苏联学习。体育运动在我们这个年青的国家里是个尤其年青的事业，必须在中国共产党和毛主席领导之下，以伟大苏联为榜样，踏实地工作，顽强地学习，经过一番长期的艰苦努力，才能说到成就，决不容存在丝毫侥幸的心理。
    在和苏联人民相处的这段时间，使我们深切感到：苏联人民对我国人民和我们伟大领袖毛主席的热爱，对我国实现社会主义抱着极高的信心，对我国体育运动和其他工作一样愿尽一切可能来帮助我们。我们永远不会忘记这些日子，这段记忆将永远鼓舞我们把工作做出成绩来，使我们的工作在推动我们国家建设事业和加强保卫祖国的神圣斗争中发挥更大的作用。
