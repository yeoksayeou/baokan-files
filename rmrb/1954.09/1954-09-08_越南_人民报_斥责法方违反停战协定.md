Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, September 6th: The Vietnamese Labor Party's newspaper "People's Daily" severely condemned the recent persecution of people in central and southern Vietnam by French Federation forces.

"People's Daily" quoted Article 14 of Chapter 2 of the Vietnam Armistice Agreement. This article stipulates that each party guarantees that no reprisals or discrimination will be taken against any person or group because of their activities during the war, and guarantees their democratic freedoms. Then, "People's Daily" listed many specific facts showing that the French side condoned their army's blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement.

"People's Daily" pointed out that in Binh Thuan Province, Zone 5, two special agents of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique arrested a young man named Lu Mong on August 10, tortured him, and stabbed him to death. On August 16, fourteen puppet soldiers in Ai Nghia Village, Quang Nam Province, killed three local residents and injured more than sixty others. On the same day, French troops in Phu Yen Province captured five children. The next day, when local residents went to the French military location to demand the return of these children, the French troops barbarously opened fire on them, injuring sixty-five people.

In South Vietnam, on August 10, French troops kidnapped twenty local residents near Cape Ca Mau, murdered them, and threw their bodies into the jungle.

On August 11, several Khmer residents in Tra Vinh Province were suddenly arrested simply because they had greeted a delegation from the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army.

In Can Tho Province, puppet troops opened fire on cadres of the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army who were conveying the ceasefire order to various rural areas.

After listing the above facts, "People's Daily" finally emphasized that the French authorities must be held responsible for these acts, and in the future, be responsible for guaranteeing the lives, property, freedom, and democratic rights of the Vietnamese people. Only in this way can favorable conditions be created for the implementation of other clauses of the ceasefire agreement, in order to smash the war-mongers' conspiracy to sabotage peace, which is neither beneficial to the Vietnamese people nor to the French people.

    越南“人民报”斥责法方违反停战协定
    【新华社七日讯】据越南通讯社北越六日讯：越南劳动党机关报“人民报”严厉谴责法兰西联邦部队最近对越南中部和南部人民进行的迫害行为。
    “人民报”引述了越南停战协定第二章第十四条的条文。这一条规定每方保证不得对任何人和团体因其在战时的活动而加以任何报复与歧视，并保证他们的民主自由。然后，“人民报”就列举许多具体的事实表明法方纵容他们的军队公然违反停战协定。
    “人民报”指出：在第五联区平顺省，吴庭艳集团的两名特务在八月十日逮捕了一个名叫吕檬的青年，拷打他，并把他刺死。八月十六日，广南省爱义村的十四名伪军杀死了当地居民三人，并打伤了六十多人。同一天，富安省的法军抓去了五个儿童。第二天，当地居民前往法军所在地要求放回这些儿童的时候，法军竟野蛮地向他们开枪，击伤了六十五人。
    在南越，法军八月十日在金瓯角附近掳去了当地居民二十人，杀害了他们，并把他们的尸体抛在丛林中。
    八月十一日，茶荣省的若干名高棉族居民突然被捕了，原因只是因为他们曾经迎接过越南人民军总司令部的代表团。
    在芹苴省，伪军曾开枪袭击正在把停火命令传达到各农村去的越南人民军总司令部的干部。
    在列举了上述事实后，“人民报”最后强调指出：无论如何，法国当局必须对这些行为负责，并在今后负责保证越南人民的生命、财产、自由和民主的权利。只有这样，才能为停战协定的其他条款的实施创造有利条件，以粉碎战争贩子企图破坏和平、既不利于越南人民，也不利于法国人民的阴谋。
