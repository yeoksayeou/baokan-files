    At the Shevchenko Collective Farm
    — Notes from a Visit to Ukraine, Part 5
    By Our Correspondent Lǐ Hé
    "The hardworking Chinese people are hospitable, but if they find you have deceived them, they will break off relations with you." The chairman of the Shevchenko Collective Farm in Shpolyansky District, Cherkasy Oblast, Mikhail Yefimovich Boyko, said this in front of us to the district committee secretary and farm members, introducing what he knew about the character of the Chinese people. The large Boyko participated in the Soviet army's campaign to liberate the Northeast in 1945, and after the war, he returned to the collective farm and was elected chairman. His understanding of China is very accurate.

    Perhaps because this chairman usually talks about China, the farm members are very interested in New China. When we visited the cattle farm, the milkmaids gathered around to ask about the lives of Chinese farmers and Chinese women. They were so happy to hear that Chinese farmers, after completing land reform, are also taking the path of collectivization. They said in unison: Chinese farmers taking the path of collectivization will surely lead a happy life like them.

    We were at the summer camp for dairy cows. In the green meadows, there was a row of ventilated corridor-style cow sheds, with dozens of strong cows standing or lying down. A group of cows were drinking water at the water trough by the well near the cow shed. Another group of cows were grazing on the hillside in front of the cow shed. These cows are sent to the summer camp from May and returned to the permanent livestock farm when it gets cold in the autumn. In other collective farms and state farms in Ukraine, we also saw summer camps for feeding cattle and raising pigs set up either by the river or under the trees. This is of great help to the development of livestock.

    In one corner of the summer camp cow shed, a red flag of competition excellence was planted. It was awarded by the Communist Youth League District Committee to the Communist Youth League production team of the livestock farm. We met twenty-two-year-old female League member Mashi Nia. After finishing sixth grade, she joined agricultural labor and worked as a milkmaid. The general standard is that one person takes care of fifteen cows, and each cow produces 1,700 liters of milk a year (in fact, the milk production period for cows is only nine months). She guaranteed that each cow would produce 4,000 liters of milk a year. In six months, each cow has already produced 2,660 liters. She now completes 220 percent of her plan every day.

    Two hundred cows, eight hundred and twenty pigs, five hundred and seven sheep, three thousand poultry, and more than two hundred horses - this is the public livestock industry of the Shevchenko Collective Farm. All farm members actively responded to the Party's call to strive to improve livestock products. For example, they plan to increase the milk production of each cow from 2,860 liters in 1953 to 3,200 liters in 1954 and 3,600 liters in 1955.

    The Shevchenko Collective Farm, with six hundred and fifty-seven peasant households, develops a variety of economies. The main crops are wheat and sugar beets. Of its two thousand nine hundred hectares of land, one thousand six hundred and eighty hectares are planted with wheat and three hundred and fifty hectares are planted with sugar beets. Millet, corn, and buckwheat are also grown. The collective farm can earn three million rubles this year. Each workday will be rewarded with four rubles and two and a half to three kilograms of grain. Due to the state's reduction of agricultural taxes and increase in the purchase price of agricultural products, the collective farm earns an additional 500,000 rubles a year. We also visited the homes of farm members. Here, the life of the collective farm and the farm members is very good. The collective farm's club screens movies at least once a week. The library has four thousand books. Radio broadcasts are set up throughout the village. There are three nurseries. Especially pleasing is the children's sanatorium.

    We entered a place screened by towering trees and discovered a building like a kindergarten: bright houses, a quiet dining hall, and a beautiful flower garden. A white-coated caregiver led a group of lively children in playing. They were playing hide-and-seek. They shyly recited poems to us. One child missed a line, and another child interjected to correct it. This children's sanatorium works from May to September, has fifty beds, and takes in children aged four to seven for a month at a time. All farm members' children can take turns in the summer. After a month of recuperation, some children gained four kilograms, so fat that their parents could not recognize them. In addition to the director, there are three caregivers and two cooks. The collective farm provides the children's sanatorium with various foods and 12,000 rubles in cash a year. There are many children's sanatoriums in the Soviet Union, but it is rare to hear of collective farms running their own. This initiative of the Shevchenko Collective Farm has received attention from all sides. Shpolyansky District alone will open five collective farm children's sanatoriums next year.

    The prosperity of the farm members' lives is also reflected in the trade of the rural consumer cooperative. In a fairly large consumer cooperative store, there are various foods, fabrics, clothing, shoes, hats, musical instruments, bicycles, and toys. The consumer cooperative sold 1.65 million rubles worth of goods last year, and has already sold 1 million rubles worth of goods in the first half of this year. During the busy summer farming season, in order to save the farm members time and effort, the consumer cooperative salespersons put the goods on carts and push them to the fields to sell. The cooperative has five sales stations, four of which have outgoing salespersons. The consumer cooperative has a special order book to register the farm members' requests and then requests goods from the district consumer cooperative. The goods that are obtained in this way are exactly what the farm members need. In addition, the consumer cooperative purchases the farm members' surplus meat, milk, eggs, vegetables, fruits, etc., according to contracts signed with the farm members. The prices are set by the higher-level cooperative. The farm members receive payment as soon as they deliver the goods, without having to run to the market themselves, which is very convenient.

    The Shevchenko Collective Farm is one of the advanced collective farms in Shpolyansky District, and Shpolyansky District is one of the advanced districts in Cherkasy Oblast. In the Soviet Union, the Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, and Central Asian republics have two levels of administrative units, oblast and district, between the central government and the countryside, while the other eight republics have only the district level between the central government and the countryside. Therefore, the district is a link that has a decisive significance for production. Shpolyansky District has 48,000 hectares of land, of which 45,000 hectares are cultivated land. The most important crops are sugar beets and wheat. Sugar beets occupy 5,800 hectares, wheat occupies 13,000 hectares, and corn occupies 3,000 hectares. There are two sugar factories in the district. We saw a sugar beet field as large as more than 300 hectares. The district has 13,000 cattle, 12,000 pigs, 13,000 sheep, and 60,000 poultry.

    The socialist agricultural strength of Ukraine is strong. The agricultural laborers of Ukraine will achieve greater success in further developing agriculture.

    在谢甫钦科集体农庄
    ——乌克兰访问记之五
    本报记者　李何
    “勤劳的中国人民是好客的，但是如果发现你骗了他，他就和你断绝了往来。”切尔卡斯州什波梁区谢甫钦科集体农庄主席米海尔·叶菲莫维奇·波伊科，当着我们面向区委书记和庄员们这样介绍他所认识的中国人民的性格。大个子的波伊科，在一九四五年参加了苏军解放东北的战役，战后回到集体农庄被选为主席，他对于中国的认识是很正确的。
    也许由于这位主席平常谈过中国事情，庄员们对于新中国的兴趣很浓厚。当我们参观饲牛场的时候，挤牛奶的女庄员们围拢来问中国农民和中国妇女的生活。听说土地改革完成后的中国农民也走着合作化集体化的道路，她们多么高兴啊。她们异口同声地说：中国农民走合作化集体化的道路，一定会同她们一样过着幸福的生活的。
    我们是在奶牛的夏令场上。在绿草如茵的旷野上，盖着一列通风的走廊式牛栏，或站或卧着几十头硕壮的母牛。一群母牛在牛栏附近水井边的水槽上喝水。一群母牛在牛栏前面坡地上放牧。这些母牛从五月起被送到夏令场来，秋凉时又送回常设的饲畜场去。在乌克兰其他的集体农庄和国营农场，我们也看到或在河边或在树下设立的喂牛养猪的夏令场。这对于牲畜的发育有很大帮助。
    夏令场牛栏的一角，插着一面竞赛优胜红旗。它是共青团区委会奖给饲畜场的共青团员生产组的。我们碰见了二十二岁的女团员马喜尼亚。她念完六年级以后，就参加了农业劳动，做挤牛奶工作。本来一般标准一人照管十五头母牛，每头母牛一年（实际上母牛产牛奶期只九个月）产牛奶一千七百公升。她保证每头母牛一年产牛奶四千公升。六个月中每头母牛已产二千六百六十公升。她现在每天完成计划的百分之二百二十。
    二百头母牛、八百二十头猪、五百零七只绵羊、三千只家禽和二百多匹马——这是谢甫钦科集体农庄的公有饲畜业。全体庄员积极响应党的号召，努力提高畜产品。例如每头母牛的产奶量，他们计划从一九五三年的二千八百六十公升提高到一九五四年的三千二百公升和一九五五年的三千六百公升。
    有六百五十七户农民的谢甫钦科集体农庄发展着多种经济。主要种的是小麦和甜菜。它的二千九百公顷土地中，一千六百八十公顷种了小麦，三百五十公顷种了甜菜。此外还种粟子、玉米和荞麦。集体农庄今年可以收入三百万卢布。每个劳动日将报酬四个卢布和两公斤半到三公斤谷物。由于国家减低农业税和提高农产品收购价格，集体农庄一年多得五十万卢布。我们也拜访了庄员的家庭。这里集体农庄和庄员的生活是很好的。集体农庄的俱乐部，每星期至少要放映一次电影。图书馆存着四千册书。无线电广播器遍设全庄。托儿所有三个。特别令人喜欢的是儿童疗养所。
    我们进到了一块参天的树木作围屏的地方，发现了像幼儿园的建筑物：明亮的房子、清静的食堂、美丽的花圃。白衣保育员带领一群活泼的儿童在玩着。他们捉迷藏。到我们面前羞怯地背诵诗歌。有一个小孩背漏了，别的小孩插进来改正。这个儿童疗养所从五月工作到九月，有五十个位子，收四岁到七岁儿童，一个月为期，所有庄员的儿童夏天都能轮到。经过一个月疗养，有些孩子长了四公斤，胖得他们的父母都认不得了。除了所长外，有三个保育员和两个厨师。集体农庄一年供给儿童疗养所各种食物和一万二千卢布现金。苏联有很多儿童疗养所，但集体农庄自办的还很少听见。谢甫钦科集体农庄这个创举，受到各方面重视。仅什波梁区明年就要开办五个集体农庄儿童疗养所。
    庄员生活的富裕，也表现在农村消费合作社的贸易上。在一个颇大的消费合作社的商店里，陈列着各色食品、布匹、服装、鞋帽、音乐器具、自行车以及玩具。消费合作社在去年售出了一百六十五万卢布货物，今年上半年已售出了一百万卢布货物。夏季农忙，为了免得庄员们往返费时，消费合作社售货员把货物放在车上推到田间去销售。合作社有五个售货站，其中四个都有外出的售货员。消费合作社设有专门的订货簿，登记庄员的要求，然后向区消费合作社要货，这样办来的货物正是庄员需要的。此外，消费合作社按照和庄员签订的合同，收购庄员盈余的肉类、牛奶、鸡蛋、蔬菜、水果等，价格由上级合作社订妥。庄员一交货就得到款，不用自己跑市场，很方便。
    谢甫钦科集体农庄是什波梁区二十三个集体农庄中先进的一个，而什波梁区又是切尔卡斯州三十个区中先进的一个。在苏联，俄罗斯、乌克兰、白俄罗斯和中亚五个加盟共和国，在中央到乡村之间有州、区两级行政单位，其他八个加盟共和国在中央和乡村之间只有区一级。所以区对于生产是有决定意义的环节。什波梁区有四万八千公顷土地，其中耕地有四万五千公顷。最主要的农作物是甜菜和小麦。甜菜占五千八百公顷，小麦占一万三千公顷，玉米占三千公顷。区里有两个制糖厂。我们看见有一块甜菜地大到三百多公顷。全区有一万三千头牛，一万二千头猪、一万三千只羊、六万只家禽。
    乌克兰社会主义农业力量是雄厚的。乌克兰农业劳动者在进一步发展农业上将会取得更大成就。
