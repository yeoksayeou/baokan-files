    "We Must Overfulfill the Overproduction Plan!"
    – A Record of the "Pioneer" Agricultural Production Cooperative and the Villagers' Activities to Strive for Overproduction in Anyang, Henan
    Mu Feng
    Before the Beginning of Autumn Festival, in the "Pioneer" Agricultural Production Cooperative of Guo Wangdu Village, Anyang County, Henan Province, all crops were growing far better than last year: The more than 300 mu of millet were all uniformly bearing half-foot-long ears, drooping heavily; the 550 mu of cotton were covered with red and yellow blossoms, with more bolls than any previous year. The cooperative members all said, "Once the Beginning of Autumn arrives, discard the hoe." After working hard for more than half a year, taking such good care of the crops, it was time for a rest. Many young female cooperative members, who had been responsible for all the cotton management, now wanted to visit relatives. During a meeting of the cooperative's committee, many committee members also said that the crop harvest was now certain, and they should immediately turn to cleaning up and repairing farm tools to prepare for the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing.

    Just then, the resolution of the First Session of the First People's Congress of Henan Province, calling on all farmers in the province to overfulfill the agricultural production increase plan (requiring an overproduction of 6 jin of grain and 1 jin of ginned cotton per mu on top of the original plan), arrived. Many cooperative members shook their heads and said, "Who doesn't know 'Eighteen days after the Beginning of Autumn, every blade of grass seeds,' now the solar term has passed, how can we increase production again?" At the same time, many cooperative members believed that the cooperative had conducted single-seedling retention on all 300 mu of millet; the topping and pruning of the cotton had been timely and meticulous, and very few of the 500-plus mu had missing seedlings; small vegetables and beans had also been planted on the empty spaces along the ditch edges, field edges, and in the cotton fields. They felt that there was no more potential to be found in farming techniques.

    Was there really no more potential to be tapped? The facts proved otherwise. The Communist Party branch, on the one hand, educated the cooperative members, explaining that parts of the Yangtze and Huai River basins had suffered floods this year, and ensuring the overfulfillment of the agricultural production increase plan in non-disaster areas was of great significance to ensuring national construction; on the other hand, it organized a team to go to the fields to actually inspect the current production situation. After inspection, it was found that although the topping and pruning work in the cotton fields was much more meticulous than last year, many "fluffy buds" and "bent heads" on the cotton plants had not been removed, and even some of the tips had not been removed, with branches that did not bear cotton bolls still growing wildly; also, patches of cotton bolls had been punctured by mirid bugs. Many people who participated in the inspection remembered that last year the cooperative's cotton had suffered from a lot of bud and boll drop due to neglect of late-stage management; although the cotton plants looked good, they only harvested 160 jin of seed cotton per mu. Therefore, everyone actively used their brains to think of good ways to protect the buds and bolls. Some said that one of the reasons for cotton boll drop was insufficient fertilizer, and that last year, the Dadian Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in the same township learned from advanced experience and used foliar spraying of superphosphate, which played a great role in protecting the bolls, and that they should learn from them this year. Others suggested spraying "666" pesticide powder all over the cotton fields to prevent mirid bugs. In this way, while inspecting, they discussed and came up with many ways to increase production. Although more than 20 mu of empty land had been replanted in the past, after careful inspection and calculation, there were still at least ten more mu of green vegetables that could be planted along the ditch edges and field edges, which could yield a total of 30,000 to 40,000 jin. By earthing up the sweet potatoes at the roots and frequently turning the vines, at least 100 jin more could be harvested per mu at harvest time. Based on these potential avenues for increased production that had already been identified, the Communist Party branch and the cooperative committee studied and formulated a specific plan for overproduction: all 557 mu of cotton in the cooperative would increase production by 9 jin of seed cotton per mu on top of the original planned yield of 242 jin; millet and corn would increase production by 7 jin per mu on top of the original planned yield; including the income from replanting vegetables on the edges of ditches and fields, the cooperative initially calculated that it could increase production by more than 12,000 jin of grain and more than 5,000 jin of seed cotton in total. As a result, many cooperative members who previously thought that no further production increase was possible broke their conservative thinking.

    In order to ensure the realization of this overproduction plan, the cooperative invited cadres from the agricultural technology guidance station dispatched to the village by the special commissioner's office to teach the cooperative members the techniques of applying phosphate fertilizer to the cotton roots and fine pruning and bud removal, and explained why it was necessary to remove "bent heads" and "fluffy buds." They also specified the specific standards for how many fruiting branches to leave on each cotton plant and how many cotton bolls to leave on each fruiting branch, according to the cotton's growth and the quality of the soil, to ensure that the cotton bolls would not drop and would mature early. Then, according to the current agricultural work in the cooperative, they specifically calculated the time and labor required. According to the usual attendance rate, the cooperative's more than 300 male and female laborers not only had no surplus labor in August, but were also short more than 1,000 workdays. Many young women who originally planned to visit relatives cancelled their original plans. People scrambled to volunteer for labor. Even 60-year-old Zhang Xiuying drew up a specific plan for her family to participate in labor, ensuring that her family of three (her son, daughter-in-law, and herself) would not miss a single workday during this period of production. Guo Zhenyu, the deputy leader of the second production team and an agricultural technician, saw that when spraying superphosphate on the cotton plants, it took two people to carry the bucket and two people to use the sprayer, which used too many people; he seriously studied and came up with a way to use only two people to carry the bucket and use the sprayer, which did not reduce work efficiency but saved half the labor. Many cooperative members tried their best to improve labor efficiency. On days of continuous rain, as long as they saw a slight pause in the rain, the cooperative members would still go to the fields to work. On August 10, the female cooperative members of the second production team, after a recent rain, went to the fields barefoot and carefully shook off the accumulated water from each cotton flower to prevent rot. The early sun baked the land after the rain like a steamer, and people were sweating profusely from the heat, but they continued to work. On the afternoon of August 12, dozens of mu of millet fields in the north of the village were flooded, and the cooperative members immediately carried shovels and braved the heavy rain to dig a half-li-long drainage ditch, saving all the flooded millet fields.

    The competition to strive for the overfulfillment of the production increase plan was in full swing in the "Pioneer" Agricultural Production Cooperative. The mutual aid teams and individual farmers in the village said, "Look! The crops in the cooperative are growing so well, and they are still diligently processing and fertilizing them. We must work even harder!" In just a few days, the eight mutual aid teams in the village bought more than 250 jin of superphosphate from the supply and marketing cooperative, and also sent more than 70 women to the agricultural production cooperative to learn cotton field management techniques. As a result, the village's activities to strive for overproduction also unfolded under the leadership of the agricultural production cooperative. Now, the meticulously managed cotton fields are full of cotton bolls the size of eggs. The more than 500 mu of cotton in the "Pioneer" Agricultural Production Cooperative has increased from an average of four or five cotton bolls per plant to seven or eight, and in some cases more than a dozen.

    At a recent meeting of cooperative members, the person in charge of the cooperative committee said in a loud voice: "...In order to ensure national construction, we must continue to work hard, we must overfulfill our overproduction plan!"

    “我们要超额完成超额增产计划！”
    ——记河南安阳“先锋”农业生产合作社和全村农民争取超额增产的活动
    木风
    立秋节前，河南省安阳县郭王度村“先锋”农业生产合作社里样样庄稼长得远远超过了去年：三百多亩谷子齐刷刷地都抽出了半尺长的穗子，沉甸甸地低垂着；五百五十多亩棉花开遍了红色和黄色的花朵，桃儿比以往任何一年都多。社员们一个个都说：“立了秋，把锄丢”，忙了大半年，把庄稼苗儿伺弄得这样好，现在也该是歇歇的时候了。许多年轻的女社员过去一直担当着全部管理棉花的工作，现在也想要去串亲戚，走娘家。在社务委员会开会讨论时，许多社务委员也说：现在庄稼收成已成定局，应当立即转向收拾修整农具，准备秋收、秋耕、秋种。
    正当这时候，河南省第一届人民代表大会第一次会议关于号召全省农民超额完成农业增产计划（要求在原来计划基础上粮食每亩超额增产六斤，棉花每亩超额增产皮棉一斤）的决议传来了。很多社员听了都摇摇头说：“谁不知道‘立秋十八天，寸草结籽’，现在节气已经过了，怎么能够再增产呢？”同时，还有不少社员认为：今年社里三百多亩谷子全都进行了单株留苗；棉花摘心整枝又及时又细致，五百多亩很少有空棵；渠边地头和棉花地里缺苗的空地也都点种了小菜和豆子，在耕作技术上已经再也找不出什么潜力来了。
    真的再也没有潜力可以发挥了吗？事实证明并不是这样的。中共支部一方面向社员进行教育，讲明今年长江、淮河流域部分地区遭受水灾，非灾区保证超额完成农业增产计划对于保证祖国建设有重大的意义；一方面组织力量，下地实际检查当前生产情况。经过检查发现：棉田里的摘心整枝工作虽然比去年细致得多了，但是，棉棵上不少“毛芽”和“拐头”还没有打掉，甚至有的顶尖都没有打掉，不结棉桃的枝条还在疯长；还有一片片的棉桃已被盲椿象虫咬破了头。参加检查的许多人，想起去年社里的棉花因为忽视了后期管理，很多蕾铃都白白地落掉了；本来看着长得很好，结果每亩只摘了籽棉一百六十斤。于是，大家就都积极开动脑筋想保蕾保桃的好办法。有的说：棉花落桃的原因之一是肥分不足，去年本乡大碾屯村农业生产合作社学习先进经验，用过磷酸钙液根外喷射，对保桃起了很大作用，今年咱们要学习。也有的提出要用“六六六”药粉把棉田普遍喷打一遍，防治盲椿象。就这样一边检查，一边讨论，想出了很多增产门路。空地过去虽然曾经补种了二十多亩，但是经过仔细检查计算，渠边地头加到一起最少还有十多亩可以再种些青菜，一共就能收获三、四万斤。红薯在根部培土，再勤翻蔓，到收获时每亩最少也能多收一百斤。根据这些已经找到了的增产门路，中共支部和社务委员会研究制定了超额增产的具体计划：全社五百五十七亩棉花，每亩在原计划产量二百四十二斤的基础上，再增产籽棉九斤；谷子、玉米每亩在原计划产量基础上再增产七斤；加上沟边、渠岸等空地补种菜蔬收入计算在内，全社初步计算共可增产粮食一万二千多斤，籽棉五千多斤。这样一来，许多过去认为已经无法再增产了的社员，都打破了保守思想。
    为了保证这个超额增产计划的实现，社里邀请专署农业技术指导站派驻该村的干部向社员传授了在棉花根外施磷肥和精细整枝打杈的技术，讲解了为什么要打“拐头”和“毛芽”等等道理。他们还根据棉花生长情况和地质好坏，分别规定了每棵棉花留几个果枝、每个果枝留几个棉桃的具体标准，以保证棉桃不落和早熟。接着，又根据当前全社各样农活，具体计算了所需的时间和力量。全社三百多个男女劳动力，按照往常一般出勤率计算，在八月份不但劳动力没有剩余，而且还差一千多个工没有着落。许多本来要去串亲戚、走娘家的年轻的媳妇们听了，都取消了原来的打算。人们都争抢着自报参加多少劳动。连六十多岁的老太太张秀英也订出全家参加劳动的具体计划，保证在这段生产中，一家三口人（儿子、儿媳妇和她）一个工也不缺。第二生产队的副队长、农业技术员郭振玉，在生产中看到在往棉棵上喷射过磷酸钙液时，两人抬桶、两人使用喷雾器，用人太多了；他便认真钻研，想出连抬桶带使喷雾器只用两个人的办法，工作效率没有减低，劳动力却节省了一半。许多社员都想尽一切办法尽力提高劳动效率。在阴雨连绵的日子里，社员们只要看到雨稍一停歇，便照常下地工作。第二生产队里的女社员，在八月十日那天刚下过雨，便都赤着脚下地，细心地晃掉每朵棉花里的积水，以防腐烂。初晴的太阳把雨后的大地晒得像蒸笼一样，人们一个个热得汗流浃背，还不停地工作着。八月十二日下午，村子北面的几十亩谷地积水了，全社社员立即扛着铁锨，冒着大雨下地挖了一条半里长的排水沟，把被淹的谷地全救了出来。
    争取超额完成增产计划的竞赛在“先锋”农业生产合作社里热火朝天地开展起来了。村里的互助组和个体农民看了都说：“看！人家合作社里的庄稼长得这么好，还认真加工施肥，咱们可更得好好地加油干啦！”全村的八个互助组在几天里便到供销合作社里买回过磷酸钙二百五十多斤，还又抽出七十多个妇女到农业生产合作社里学习了棉田管理技术。于是，全村的争取超额增产的活动在农业生产合作社的带动下也展开了。现在，经过精细管理的棉田，棵棵都已结了鸡蛋大的棉桃。“先锋”农业生产合作社的五百多亩棉花，已从原来每棵平均四、五个棉桃，增加到了七、八个，多的到十几个。
    在最近一次社员大会上，社务委员会的负责人用响亮的声音向大家说：“……为了保证祖国建设，我们还要继续努力，我们要超额完成我们的超额增产计划！”
