The local government of Tibet stated: "In order to accomplish the great cause of the unification of the motherland and safeguard world and Asian peace, we, the Tibetan people, share the same will as our compatriots across the country. We must do everything in our power to support the liberation of Taiwan. We must further strengthen our unity with the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet and within the Tibetan ethnic group, remain vigilant against all conspiracies of American imperialism, consolidate our national defense, and thoroughly implement the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, and strive for the liberation of Taiwan."

The Panchen Kanpo Lija Committee of Xigaze, in its telegram to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, first pointed out: "Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, with the help of the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet, Tibet has made tremendous progress in politics, economy, and culture, and the people have begun to embark on the road to happiness." The telegram stated: "We will never allow imperialism to threaten the economic construction of our motherland and undermine the happiness of our nation. We must fight to the end for the liberation of Taiwan."

The Lhasa Patriotic Youth Cultural Association, the Patriotic Women's Association, and the Xigaze Patriotic Youth Cultural Association unanimously supported the Joint Declaration for the Liberation of Taiwan issued by the various democratic parties and people's organizations across the country. These groups stated: We will take practical actions, such as diligently studying various knowledge and earnestly publicizing the significance of liberating Taiwan to the broad masses of Tibetan people, to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating our compatriots in Taiwan who are in dire straits. More than 300 members of the Lhasa Patriotic Youth Cultural Association and the Patriotic Women's Association also convened a meeting on September 3rd to support the Joint Declaration for the Liberation of Taiwan issued by the various democratic parties and people's organizations of the People's Republic of China.

Regarding religious figures in Tibet, Wang Lejie, the Great Lama of the Zhaxilhunbu Monastery, said in his speech supporting the liberation of Taiwan: Although Tibet and Taiwan are separated by thousands of miles, the hearts of the Tibetan people and the hearts of the Taiwan compatriots are closely linked. The suffering of the Taiwan people is our suffering. We must further strengthen our unity with all fraternal ethnic groups across the country and support the liberation of Taiwan.

The People's Liberation Army soldiers stationed on the Kangzang Plateau of the motherland proposed to strive with practical actions to support the liberation of Taiwan. The soldiers guarding the national defense line expressed that they would further unite the Tibetan people, heighten their vigilance, smash all the enemy's conspiracies, and defend the southwestern national defense of the motherland in order to support the struggle for the liberation of Taiwan. The soldiers who were building the Kangzang Highway in the rain heard the news of the liberation of Taiwan, and their work enthusiasm was particularly high. Zhu Decai, a first-class meritorious soldier of a certain unit, said: "Striving to build the Kangzang Highway and striving to open it to Lhasa as soon as possible is our practical action to support the liberation of Taiwan."
