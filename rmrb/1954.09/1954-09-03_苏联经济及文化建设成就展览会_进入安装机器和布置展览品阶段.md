The "Exhibition of Achievements in Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction," soon to be held in Beijing, has entered the stage of comprehensive machinery installation and exhibit arrangement. In the newly built, magnificent Soviet Exhibition Hall, hundreds of Chinese factory and mine technicians, engineers, craftsmen, and artists are working intensely under the direct guidance of Soviet experts to carry out this work.

Over ninety percent of the exhibits have been safely transported from the Soviet Union to our country, and Soviet experts who will guide the installation and arrangement work are arriving in Beijing one after another. Among the machines in the Industrial Pavilion, those currently being installed and arranged include various new-style metal cutting machine tools, textile machinery, printing machinery, and electrical equipment; various precision instruments; various light industrial products; and in the East and West Squares there are various automobiles, road construction machinery, mining machinery, and petroleum machinery; tractors and agricultural machinery. The installation of these machines is being carried out by more than 300 engineers and technicians drawn from eighteen cities and seventy production units across the country. The intense installation work and the movement of various machines in the Industrial Pavilion create a scene reminiscent of a large factory before its opening. Ninety percent of the exhibition stands and display cabinets needed for the Cultural Pavilion, Agricultural Pavilion, and Light Industry Pavilion have been manufactured, and art personnel are carefully decorating them. In the Cultural Pavilion and Agricultural Pavilion, Soviet art experts are guiding art workers in decorating various pictures; various artworks, ethnic costumes, cultural items, and various agricultural products to be exhibited in these two pavilions will be fully arranged as soon as the Soviet experts arrive. Most of the lighting equipment in the exhibition hall has been installed, and many magnificent chandeliers, taller than a person, have been hung high in each exhibition hall, some weighing up to one ton. The decoration work of the open-air theater and cinema is nearing completion; Soviet experts have already begun planning and arranging the most elegant restaurants and the kitchen workshops, most of which are equipped with electrical appliances.

Engineering and technical personnel, the broad masses of workers, and art workers are engaging in this work, which contributes to the consolidation and development of Sino-Soviet friendship, with selfless labor and great enthusiasm. Although the hundreds of engineers and technicians installing the machines have been temporarily transferred from various locations, they are able to unite and cooperate, actively overcome various difficulties, and complete their work tasks. Yang Ligang, the head of the dispatch team, lives far away outside Andingmen, but he has never been late. Technician Mei Qingtang took the lead in moving machines into the hall in the heavy rain, driving everyone to complete the task of moving machines into the hall on schedule. Workers from the Beijing Metal Handicraft Cooperative, workers from the Beijing Timber Factory, workers from the Capital Iron Factory, and the broad masses of workers from the Tianjin Medical Device Factory, Trolleybus Repair Factory, and others, have all happily accepted the tasks assigned to them and are determined to ensure the timely opening of the exhibition. Shi Yushan and Liu Guizhi, workers from Tianjin, both expressed that they felt very honored to participate in this work. Although they are far away from the factory in Tianjin and the work has many inconveniences, they are determined to overcome the difficulties and cooperate with the timber workers and glass workers in Beijing to complete the assigned work.
