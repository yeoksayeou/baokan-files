    Soviet Union
    TASS, Moscow, September 15th: "Pravda" published an article on September 15th by L. Tolkunov entitled "Dangerous Gamble." The article stated that, according to reports, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang has intensified its provocative actions against the People's Republic of China in the past few weeks, and the piratical air raids on peaceful cities and villages on the southeastern coast of China have become more frequent.
    The armed forces of the People's Republic of China are vigilantly defending the peaceful construction of their country. They are bravely repelling the aggressors who are carrying out provocations.
    However, the instigators of the provocative actions across the Atlantic - the Kuomintang bandit gang is nothing more than their tool - remain unrepentant. They even hesitate to directly participate in military operations in the Taiwan Strait area, cheering on the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. "New York Herald Tribune" Washington correspondent reported that the US government has ordered the US Seventh Fleet to provide full support to the Kuomintang bandit gang in terms of troop movements and supplies, as well as in "defending" Kinmen Island. According to this reporter, this order, recently conveyed through the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Department of the Navy, does not rule out the possibility of more active actions by the US armed forces in the future.
    Such provocative actions by the US ruling clique will only intensify the tense situation in the Far East. The Chinese patriots regard this action as a crude interference by the United States in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China, because Kinmen Island and Taiwan are within the sovereignty of the People's Republic of China. This view is completely justified.
    Tolkunov continued, the provocative actions taken in the Taiwan area are a dangerous game of playing with fire. What is more dangerous is that this kind of collusion is being carried out behind the backs of the American people, and those who are doing this are deceiving and confusing them, not letting them know the real purpose of supporting the Chiang Kai-shek group. But despite this crazy psychological deception, the American people still oppose the US armed forces interfering in China's internal affairs. Millions of people in the United States know very well that Chiang Kai-shek is carrying out provocations to ignite the flames of war in the Far East.
    As for the allies of the United States, their newspapers are very disgusted with the dangerous collusion that the United States is engaged in in the Taiwan region. To illustrate this point, Tolkunov quoted an editorial in the "Manchester Guardian" saying that Eisenhower should understand that it is difficult to justify the US's commitment to Kinmen Island in the face of public opinion.

    New Zealand
    New Zealand's "People's Voice" published an editorial on September 8th saying, "Taiwan Island is Chinese territory." After citing many international agreements during and after World War II (which confirmed that Taiwan must be returned to China), the newspaper specifically pointed out Dulles's August 24th statement on the so-called "defense of Taiwan." "People's Voice" condemned that the United States "weapons and personnel are currently being transported to aid Chiang Kai-shek, and American ships and planes are also patrolling back and forth along the Chinese coast, threatening peace." "People's Voice" pointed out: "Any incident in this area could be described by the United States as 'Communist aggression' and lead to war. The possible consequence would be a major conflict, which, according to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, would involve New Zealand."

    United Kingdom
    TASS, London, September 13th: Labor MP Driborg wrote in the British "Reynolds News": "The Chiang Kai-shek armed forces trained and armed by the United States are carrying out heinous provocations in the area between Taiwan and mainland China." Driborg emphasized: "Taiwan should be returned to China. This is one of the territories that Roosevelt and Churchill promised to return to China after the war at the Cairo Conference in 1943. Now Chiang Kai-shek's occupation of Taiwan is the only obstacle. Can't he be suggested to move his puppet court to California? The Americans have no right to regard Taiwan as their own 'defense line', just as the Russians have no right to regard the Panama Canal as their own 'defense line'."
    The British "Daily Herald" published an article by Michael Foot, talking about the US policy of obstructing China's liberation of Taiwan.
    The article said: "The Americans have not yet decided whether Kinmen Island is within their 'protection'."
    "Because the island is so close to China that it is almost like the Isle of Wight (note: located off the coast of England) is to Southampton, their doubts are not surprising."
    "The same logic also applies entirely to Taiwan, an island much larger than Kinmen, located one hundred miles off the mainland, where Chiang Kai-shek's headquarters is located. Mr. Dulles just visited Chiang Kai-shek and promised him to defend against 'aggression'. But who is the aggressor?"
      "Only four years ago, President Truman announced: 'The United States government does not intend to supply military assistance or provide advice to Chinese troops in Taiwan.'
    "What was his reason? 'The United States government does not intend to follow any path that would involve the United States in China's internal strife.' He denied any intention of plundering 'Taiwan or other Chinese territories'."
    "Mr. Dulles is now doing what Mr. Truman promised not to do."
      "That is why the British government should never have agreed to sign the Southeast Asia Treaty at Manila this week - and there are many other reasons."
      "Why should we sign a treaty with the Americans in Asia when they insist on pursuing an extremely dangerous policy on the Chinese coast without consulting anyone?"
      "Asia will not have peace when the Americans try to restart the Chinese civil war."
    "Now is the time for Britain to speak its mind frankly. We will never participate in that war." (According to Xinhua News Agency)

### 苏联、英国等国报纸发表评论  痛斥美国指使蒋贼骚扰我国大陆

    苏联、英国等国报纸发表评论
    痛斥美国指使蒋贼骚扰我国大陆
    苏联
    塔斯社莫斯科十五日讯：“真理报”十五日发表了勒·托尔库诺夫写的一篇题为“危险的赌博”的文章。文章写道，据报道，蒋介石匪帮在过去几个星期中对中华人民共和国加紧采取挑衅行动，对中国东南沿海的和平城市和乡村进行的海盗式的空袭已变得更加频繁。
    中华人民共和国的武装部队正在警惕地保卫着他们国家的和平建设。他们正在勇敢地回击进行侵略的挑衅者。
    但是，大西洋彼岸的挑衅行动的指使者——国民党匪帮只不过是他们的工具——仍然执迷不悟。他们甚至毫不迟疑地直接参加台湾海峡地区的军事行动，为蒋介石匪帮打气。“纽约先驱论坛报”驻华盛顿记者报道，美国政府已命令美国第七舰队在军队调动和供应方面以及在“保卫”金门岛方面给国民党匪帮充分的支援。据这个记者说，最近通过参谋长联席会议和海军部传达的这个命令并不排除美国武装部队在日后采取更积极的行动的可能性。
    美国统治集团的这种挑衅行动，只会使远东的紧张局势加剧。中国的爱国者把这种行动看成是美国粗暴地干涉中华人民共和国的内政，因为金门岛和台湾是在中华人民共和国的主权范围之内。这种看法是完全正当的。
    托尔库诺夫接着说，在台湾地区采取的挑衅行动是危险的玩火行为。更危险的是这种勾当是背着美国人民干的，干这种勾当的人正在欺骗和迷惑他们，不让他们知道对蒋介石集团的支持的真正目的。但是尽管有这种疯狂的心理上的蒙骗，美国人民仍然反对美国武装部队干涉中国内政。美国的千百万人民知道得很清楚，蒋介石进行挑衅是为了在远东燃起战火。
    至于美国的盟国，它们的报纸非常厌恶美国在台湾地区所干的这种危险的勾当。为了说明这一点，托尔库诺夫援引“曼彻斯特卫报”的社论的话说，艾森豪威尔应当了解，在舆论面前为美国在金门岛承担义务辩解是很困难的。
    新西兰
    新西兰“人民之声报”九月八日发表社论说，“台湾岛是中国的领土”。这家报纸在援引第二次世界大战期间和战后的许多国际协定（这些协定确认台湾必须归还给中国）以后，特别指出了杜勒斯八月二十四日发表的关于所谓“保卫台湾”的谈话。“人民之声报”斥责说，美国“武器和人员目前正被运去援助蒋介石，美国的舰只和飞机也在中国海岸边往来巡逻，威胁着和平”。“人民之声报”指出：“在这个地区内的任何一个事件都可能被美国说成是‘共产党侵略’，而导致战争。随之而来的可能就会发生一个重大的冲突，而根据东南亚条约组织就要把新西兰牵涉在内。”
    英　国
    塔斯社伦敦十三日讯：工党议员德里勃格在英国“雷诺新闻”上写道：“美国所训练和武装的蒋介石武装部队正在台湾和中国大陆之间的地区进行可恶的挑衅。”德里勃格强调说：“台湾应当归还中国。这是罗斯福和邱吉尔在一九四三年的开罗会议上答应在战后归还中国的领土之一。现在蒋介石盘踞在台湾是唯一的障碍。难道不可以提示他把他的傀儡朝廷搬到加利福尼亚去吗？美国人没有权利把台湾看成是自己的‘防线’，正如俄国人没有权利把巴拿马运河看成是自己的‘防线’一样。”
    英国“每日先驱报”发表迈克尔·福特的一篇文章，谈到美国阻挠中国解放台湾的政策。
    文章说：“美国人尚未就金门岛是否在他们的‘保护’之内的问题作出决定。
    “因为该岛离中国之近就几乎像威地岛（按：位于英国沿海）之与南安普敦一样，因此，他们的疑虑并不奇怪。
    “同样的逻辑也完全适用于台湾，这是一个在大陆以外一百英里，比金门要大得多的岛屿，蒋介石的司令部就在那里。杜勒斯先生刚访问了蒋介石，并答应他防御‘侵略’。但是谁是侵略者呢？
      “仅在四年前，杜鲁门总统曾宣布说：‘美国政府也不拟对在台湾的中国军队供给军事援助或提供意见。’
    “他的理由是什么呢？‘美国政府不拟遵循任何足以把美国卷入中国内争中的途径’。他否认有任何对‘台湾或中国其他领土’的掠夺意图。
    “杜勒斯先生现在正是在做杜鲁门先生答应不做的事情。
      “这就是为什么英国政府本星期在马尼拉决不应该同意了签订东南亚公约的一个原因——还有许许多多其他的原因。
      “为什么我们要当美国人在不和任何人商量的情况下坚持在中国沿海奉行一种极端危险的政策的时候，和他们一起在亚洲签订条约呢？
      “当美国人企图把中国内战重新打起来时，亚洲就不得和平。
    “现在已是英国直率地说出真心话的时候了。我们决不参加那个战争。”　（据新华社讯）
