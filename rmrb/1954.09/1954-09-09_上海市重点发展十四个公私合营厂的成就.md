Editor's Note: Since October 1953, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government has been carrying out public-private joint operation work in fourteen private factories, including Datong Iron Factory, Shanghai Machine Factory, Huacheng Electrical Factory, Xin'an Motor Factory, Zhengtai Rubber Factory, Zhongnan Rubber Factory, Jiangnan Paper Mill, Shunfeng Enamel Factory, Tongyi Yarn Factory, Chongxin Yarn Factory, Xinyu Textile Factory, Hengda Textile Factory, Dingxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory, and Maochang Egg Industry Refrigeration Company. After consultation, these fourteen factories announced their public-private joint operation in January and February of this year. For more than half a year since the joint operation, the production enthusiasm of the workers in each factory has greatly increased, the management has improved to a certain extent, and a new atmosphere has emerged in production.

Running public-private joint industrial enterprises well is not only a complex task but also a new one. This requires all parties within the enterprise, including public representatives, workers, technicians, and private representatives, to work together in accordance with the provisions of the "Provisional Regulations on Public-Private Joint Industrial Enterprises" to run the enterprise well. Here are articles by public representatives, workers, technicians, and private representatives from the fourteen key public-private joint industrial enterprises in Shanghai. They provide preliminary experience and are worth referring to by all relevant parties.

Achievements of Shanghai's Fourteen Key Public-Private Partnership Factories
By Our Correspondent Zhang Chao

In accordance with the policy stipulated in the general task of the state during the transition period to gradually carry out socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, Shanghai focused on developing fourteen public-private joint ventures last winter (1953), creating experience for Shanghai to further develop public-private joint industrial enterprises.

These fourteen factories include relatively large-scale enterprises in machinery, electrical equipment, textiles, printing and dyeing, rubber, etc., which are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Before the joint operation, these enterprises had already accepted socialist transformation to a preliminary extent through national processing and ordering, but because the production relations of the enterprises had not undergone major changes, it was difficult to further improve management and develop production to meet the needs of the state and the people. After studying the general task of the state during the transition period, the vast majority of workers within the enterprises actively demanded to develop towards a higher form of state capitalism. Capitalists also realized that the general trend and the will of the people pointed towards the bright road of accepting socialist transformation through state capitalism. Therefore, they applied for public-private joint operation one after another, and the Shanghai Municipal People's Government approved the implementation of joint operation of these enterprises last winter.

Because these enterprises have become public-private joint-owned enterprises, with socialist components in a leading position, the status of workers in the enterprises has changed, and they have adopted an attitude of ownership towards the enterprises. Capitalists and their agents have been educated and transformed. Therefore, in just half a year, these enterprises have undergone major changes, further demonstrating the superiority of the higher form of state capitalism. This is manifested in:

First, the socialist management policy is gradually replacing the capitalist management policy. That is, taking the development of production, ensuring needs, and meeting the requirements of the state plan as the management policy. One of the main manifestations is the widespread attention paid to improving quality. Before the joint operation, due to the dominance of capitalist management policies, product quality was generally not valued. Most factories did not have technical inspection institutions, let alone inspection standards and systems. As a result, the quality of products was poor, and some capitalists often resisted returns and fines by means of disguise and deception. In 1953 (before the joint operation), Xin'an Motor Factory manufactured "Lihua Na" electric equipment for a paper mill. The equipment failed immediately after installation, preventing the paper mill from starting production, resulting in a loss of 600 million yuan per day. Some workers and technicians were also influenced by capitalist management thinking and did not pay attention to quality. These situations show that without criticizing the capitalist management thinking of seeking profit only through quality issues with socialist management thinking, public-private joint ventures will not be able to demonstrate their superiority and will cause losses to the country and the people.

To this end, Shanghai Machine Factory, Xin'an Motor Factory, Huacheng Motor Factory, etc., have taken quality as the center and carried out a series of ideological work and preliminary management reforms. For example, through waste product exhibitions and detailed accounting, capitalists, technicians, and even workers are educated to recognize the importance of product quality to national construction. In conjunction with this, various necessary responsibility systems and institutions have been established. Most have established inspection sections or inspection groups, strengthened technical guidance in production, and some have also formulated operating procedures. Many senior technicians and senior staff members were influenced by capitalist thinking for a long time and did not pay attention to improving product quality. At the same time, because they were also despised by capitalists, they felt that they were just "fans turning on the axis (referring to capitalists)" in the old enterprises and did not receive attention. Now, under the attention and education of the state, they gradually overcome their weaknesses, learn advanced experience, improve technical level, go deep into the workshops, approach workers, and cooperate with senior workers to gradually combine "technology with labor." Here is an example: Hengda Textile Factory once ordered a bale breaker from China Machine Factory, but because the machine itself was poorly manufactured, it could not be started from July last year to March this year. After the joint operation, the public representative mobilized technicians to study. The technicians initially had no confidence, but after discussions with senior workers, it started to operate in only half a month. In addition, some textile factory technicians also tried fixed supply methods with workers to improve quality, or organized technical learning groups to help improve workers' technical level. In addition, education was conducted for capitalists, and the socialist management policy was expounded through "quality first." After this series of work, improving product quality has begun to receive widespread attention.

Second, relying on the continuous improvement of the socialist consciousness of the working masses in the joint ventures, tapping potential, and continuously improving labor productivity. From the first day of the joint operation, the status of workers in the enterprise changed, and the public and the working masses were in a leading position in the enterprise. All public representatives of the joint ventures, relying on the leadership of the Party and the government, and with the close cooperation of the Party, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League within the enterprise, further educated the workers on the general task and continuously improved the socialist consciousness of the workers, clarifying the status and responsibilities of the workers in the joint ventures. In the early days of the joint operation, each factory convened a workers' representative conference. Zhengtai Rubber Factory and others started by inspecting production and fully promoted democracy at the conference. From the comparison of the old and new enterprises, they realized that the production relations had undergone major changes after the joint operation of the enterprise and established the idea of ​​being the master of the house. Many factories have convened two workers' representative conferences, and various major reforms and measures, quarterly or monthly production plans, have been submitted to the conferences for study, revision, and then implemented. Through the meeting, the criticisms, supervision, and initiatives of the workers are accepted. At a workers' representative conference of Xin'an Motor Factory, representatives put forward more than 100 constructive opinions around improving production and transforming the enterprise. Xin'an Motor Factory and others also absorbed worker representatives to participate in factory affairs meetings. A worker representative of Xin'an Motor Factory criticized the administrative leaders at an enlarged meeting of factory affairs for a product that was reworked and repaired five times in a row, criticized the engineers for only going to the electrician workshop but not the machine shop to help solve technical problems, and requested the establishment of a responsibility system, the formulation of new product operating procedures, and the strengthening of the inspection system. Xinyu Textile Factory and others discussed the factory's plan through the workers' representative conference, mobilized the workers in each workshop to discuss the team's plan, criticized the capitalist management thinking of blind production and not paying attention to the plan, and established the concept of planning. All these measures greatly improved the workers' sense of ownership. Some workers were very moved after listening to the report on the factory's production and financial situation at the workers' representative conference, saying, "I have worked for decades and never knew the factory's assets. Today I am the owner of the enterprise."

Due to the improvement of the workers' sense of ownership, the potential was tapped and labor productivity was improved. After the joint operation, most factories reduced working hours, improved quality, shortened the production cycle, and production tasks and delivery tasks could be completed as scheduled. In particular, the quality of products was generally improved. Taking working hours as an example: Shanghai Machine Factory manufactured a twelve-foot water pump, which required seventy workers before the joint operation, and the estimated cost after the joint operation was fifty-nine workers, while the actual working hours were reduced to 39.6 workers. The two types of hexagonal lathes in the second quarter plan of Datong Iron Factory this year have reduced the actual working hours by 30% to 35% compared to before the joint operation. Taking quality as an example: In February this year (at the beginning of the joint operation), the sub-secondary rate of automobile tires in Zhengtai Rubber Factory reached 12%, while in May it dropped to 1.69%. Before the joint operation, product delivery delays and fines were common phenomena. For example, in January this year (before the joint operation), Xin'an Motor Factory had fines for ten contracts, totaling more than 40 million yuan, and only one contract for 380,000 yuan in April.

Third, the socialist component leadership was established organizationally, the socialist transformation work in the joint ventures was strengthened, and the capitalists and their agents were united and transformed, so that they could have power and responsibility under the leadership of the public, and perform their duties conscientiously. In addition to the state dispatching a few cadres, the fourteen joint ventures attached importance to the unity and education of engineering and technical personnel and staff, and continuously promoted outstanding workers within the factory, changed the leadership components of the enterprise, and strengthened the organization and role of the Party, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League, which played a decisive role in the transformation of the enterprise. According to incomplete statistics from only five joint ventures such as Xinyu Textile Factory, more than 90 cadres were promoted (only a few cadres were sent). Among the 52 section chiefs and workshop directors promoted, workers accounted for 27%, which strengthened the leading force of socialism organizationally.

At the same time, under the leadership of the public representatives, each joint venture, relying on all the workers of the factory, correctly implemented the policy of uniting and transforming capitalists. Each joint venture generally achieved the goal of using the original personnel according to their talents and making appropriate arrangements based on the policy and the spirit of full consultation. Under the principle of obeying the leadership of the public, appropriate divisions of labor were made between the president and vice presidents or the president and vice managers, and a collective office system was established. Some of the original capitalists or agents of the enterprises served as managers of the joint ventures and began to care about production. Many capitalists and their agents have further recognized the future of the country, the enterprise, and the individual, and expressed their willingness to further accept socialist transformation, accept the leadership and education of the public, and accept the supervision of the workers. For example, Gao Aizhou (the person in charge of the capital before the joint operation) of Dingxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory was accustomed to the capitalist management style in the early days of the joint operation and was unwilling to ask higher authorities for instructions on policy issues related to the enterprise. Later, the workers' representatives put forward many opinions at the workers' representative conference. At the same time, the cadres sent by the state patiently helped him. Later, Gao Aizhou expressed that he would humbly accept the transformation.

    编者按：上海市人民政府自一九五三年十月份起，在大同铁工厂、上海机器厂、华成电器厂、新安电机厂、正泰橡胶厂、中南橡胶厂、江南造纸厂、顺风搪瓷厂、统益纱厂、崇信纱厂、新裕纺织厂、恒大纺织厂、鼎新染织厂、茂昌蛋业冷藏公司等十四个私营厂中进行了公私合营工作。经过协商，这十四个工厂于今年一、二月份宣布公私合营。合营半年多以来，各厂职工生产积极性大大提高，经营管理有了一定程度的改善，生产上出现了一片新的气象。
    办好公私合营工业企业，不但是一项复杂的工作，也是一项新的工作。这就需要企业内的公方代表、职工群众、技术人员、私方代表等各方面，遵照“公私合营工业企业暂行条例”的规定，共同努力，把企业办好。这里发表上海市重点发展的十四个公私合营工业企业中的公方代表、工人、技术人员、私方代表的文章。它们提供了初步的经验，值得各有关方面参考。
    上海市重点发展十四个公私合营厂的成就
    本报记者　张潮
    根据国家过渡时期总任务规定的逐步对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的政策，上海市在去年（一九五三年）冬季重点发展了十四个公私合营厂，为上海市进一步发展公私合营工业企业的工作创造了经验。
    这十四个厂，包括机械、电气器材、纺织、印染、橡胶等规模较大的有利于国计民生的企业。合营前，这些企业都已通过国家加工订货，初步接受了社会主义改造，但是由于企业的生产关系没有大的改变，因而难以进一步改善经营管理、发展生产，满足国家和人民的需要。经过对国家过渡时期总任务的学习，企业内部广大职工积极要求向国家资本主义的高级形式发展，资本家也认识到大势所趋、人心所向，经过国家资本主义接受社会主义改造是一条光明大道，因而先后申请公私合营，上海市人民政府就在去年冬季批准了这些企业实行合营。
    由于这些企业变成了公私共有的企业，社会主义成分居于领导地位，工人在企业中的地位改变了，对企业采取了主人翁的态度，资本家及其代理人受到了教育和改造。因此，短短半年光阴，这些企业就发生了较大变化。进一步显示了国家资本主义的高级形式优越性。这表现在：
    第一，社会主义的经营方针逐步代替了资本主义的经营方针。就是以发展生产，保证需要和国家计划的要求为经营方针。主要表现之一，就是对提高质量已引起了普遍的重视。合营前由于资本主义经营方针的支配，一般是不重视产品质量的，多数厂没有技术检验机构，更没有检验标准和制度，因而产品品质低劣，有些资本家还常常以伪装、欺骗的手段来抗拒退货、罚款。新安电机厂一九五三年
  （合营前）为某造纸厂制造“利华纳”电动设备，安装后即发生故障，使该造纸厂不能开工生产，一天的损失就达六亿元。有些工人和技术人员也往往由于资本主义经营思想的影响，不重视质量。这些情况说明：不通过质量问题以社会主义经营思想来批判唯利是图的资本主义经营思想，公私合营企业就无从表现其优越性，对国家、对人民将造成损失。
    为此，上海机器厂、新安电机厂、华成电机厂等都以质量为中心，进行了一系列的思想工作和初步的经营管理的改革工作，例如通过废品展览和算细账等方式，教育资本家、技术人员以至职工，使之认识产品质量对国家建设的重要意义，结合建立了各种必要的责任制度和机构，大多设立了检验科或检验组，加强了生产上的技术指导，有的还制订了操作规程。许多高级技术人员高级职员过去长期受着资本主义思想的影响，也不重视产品质量的提高，同时由于自己也被资本家轻视，感觉自己在旧企业中也不过是“地轴上（指资本家）的风扇跟着转”，受不到重视。现在，在国家的重视和教育下，逐步克服了自己的弱点，学习先进经验，提高技术水平，深入车间，接近工人，与老年工人合作，逐步使“技术与劳动相结合”，这里可以举一个例子：如恒大纺织厂曾由中国机器厂订造一部拆包机，但因机器本身制造不良，从去年七月起安装到今年三月，仍不能开工运转。合营后，公方代表发动技术人员研究，技术人员开始没有信心，经过与老年工人座谈研究，只花半个月的时间，就开始运转了。此外，有些纺织厂的技术人员还和工人一起试行固定供应等办法来提高质量，或组织技术学习小组，帮助提高工人的技术水平。此外，还向资本家进行教育，通过“质量第一”阐释社会主义的经营方针。经过这一系列的工作，提高产品质量已开始普遍引起重视。
    第二，依靠合营厂内工人群众社会主义觉悟的不断提高，挖掘潜力，不断提高劳动生产率。从合营的第一天起，工人就改变了在企业中的地位，公方与职工群众结合一起居于企业的领导地位。所有合营厂的公方代表，都依靠党和政府的领导，在企业内党、工、团密切配合下，进一步向职工进行总任务的教育，不断提高职工社会主义觉悟，明确职工在合营企业内的地位与责任。合营初期，各厂召开了职工代表会议。正泰橡胶厂等都从检查生产入手，在会议上充分发扬民主，从新旧企业的对比中认识了企业合营后生产关系发生了重大变化，确立当家作主的思想。许多厂已召开了两次的职工代表会议，各种重大的改革和措施，季度或月度的生产计划，都提交会议研究、修正，再贯彻下去。通过会议接受职工的批评、监督和创议。新安电机厂的一次职工代表会议上，代表们围绕搞好生产、改造企业提出了一百多条建设性意见。新安电机厂等并吸收工人代表参加厂务会议。新安电机厂的工人代表，曾在一次厂务扩大会议上以一项产品连续五次返工退修，对行政领导提出批评，批评工程师只下电工车间，不下机工车间来帮助解决技术问题，同时要求建立责任制、制订新产品操作规程、加强检验制度等等。新裕纺织厂等通过职工代表会议，讨论全厂计划，发动各车间工人讨论小组计划，批判盲目生产、不重视计划的资本主义经营思想，树立计划观念。这一切措施，大大提高了职工的主人翁感。有些工人在职工代表会议上听了全厂生产财务情况报告后，很感动地说：“作了几十年工，从来不知道厂里家底，今天才是企业的主人了。”
    由于职工主人翁感的提高，挖掘了潜力，提高了劳动生产率。合营后，多数厂压缩了工时，提高了质量，缩短了生产周期，生产任务和交货任务多能如期完成，特别是产品质量普遍提高，以工时为例：上海机器厂制造十二尺水泵，合营前要七十个工，合营后估报五十九个工，而实际工时则减为三十九点六个工。大同铁工厂今年第二季度计划中的两种六角车床，比合营前的实际工时减少了百分之三十到百分之三十五。以质量为例：正泰橡胶厂今年二月份（合营之初）汽车外胎副次率竟达百分之十二，而五月份则下降至百分之一点六九。合营前，产品脱期罚款是普遍的现象，例如新安电机厂今年一月份（合营前）罚款达十份合同、四千多万元，四月份只有一份、三十八万元。
    第三，在组织上树立了社会主义成分领导，加强了合营厂内的社会主义改造工作，同时团结与改造资本家及其代理人，使之在公方领导下有职有权、守职尽责。十四个合营厂内除了国家委派少数干部外，重视了对工程技术人员、职员的团结教育工作，并不断提拔厂内优秀职工，改变企业的领导成分，加强党、工、团的组织与作用，对企业改造具有决定作用。仅根据新裕纺织厂等五个合营厂的不完全统计，共提拔了九十多名干部（只有少数干部是派去的）。在提升的五十二名科长、车间主任中，工人成分占百分之二十七，这就从组织上加强了社会主义的领导力量。
    与此同时，各合营厂在公方代表领导下，依靠全厂职工，正确贯彻了团结与改造资本家的政策，各合营厂一般做到了根据政策和充分协商的精神，对资方实职人员，参酌原有情况量材使用，适当安排，在服从公方领导的原则下，正副厂长或正副经理之间进行了适当分工，并建立集体办公制，有些原企业的资方或资方代理人担任合营企业经理等职，开始关心生产。不少资本家及其代理人，还进
  一步认识了国家、企业和个人的前途，表示要进
  一步接受社会主义改造，接受公方的领导与教育，接受工人群众的监督，例如鼎新染织厂高霭周（合营前资方负责人）在合营初期，由于习惯于资本主义经营作风，企业中有关政策性的问题，不愿请示上级机关。后来在职工代表会议上职工代表提出许多意见。同时国家派下去的干部对其耐心地进行帮助，以后高霭周表示自己要虚心接受改造。
