    Achievements in Beijing Municipal Government Construction
    Ma Yuhuai
    Over the past five years, Beijing's political power organizations at all levels and the people's democratic system have been gradually established and improved with the gradual development of economic construction and the increasing degree of organization of the people.
    At the beginning of the liberation of Beijing, the Military Control Commission and the Municipal People's Government convened symposiums with people from all walks of life, including workers, capitalists, university professors, and ethnic minorities, to discuss major issues in the city's work. In August 1949, the Military Control Commission and the Municipal People's Government invited more than 300 representatives from all walks of life to hold the first session of the People's Representative Conference of All Circles, which was consultative in nature. At this meeting, Chairman Mao personally attended and gave important instructions: when conditions are ripe, the current form of the People's Representative Conference of All Circles can exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress. According to Chairman Mao's instructions, after active preparations, Beijing convened the second session of the People's Representative Conference of All Circles in November of the same year, which exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress. Up to June 1954, the Municipal People's Representative Conference of All Circles had convened a total of four sessions and twelve meetings. The number of representatives at each session has increased, and the number of representatives directly and indirectly elected has also increased with each session. The number of representatives to the second session of the Municipal People's Representative Conference of All Circles increased to 424, of which more than 70 percent were appointed by various people's organizations. The number of representatives to the third session of the Municipal People's Representative Conference of All Circles increased to 519, of which 83.4 percent were elected by people from all walks of life. In the election, state-owned industrial and mining enterprises and colleges and universities have achieved direct election by voters' congresses with production or schools as units; peasants, women, business circles, and regional representatives have generally achieved election by voters' representative conferences. At the same time, unsigned voting was adopted in colleges and universities. These methods were familiar and convenient to the masses at that time. The fourth session of the Municipal People's Representative Conference of All Circles has made considerable progress and development on the basis of the previous three sessions. The total number of representatives increased to 555, of which 83.7 percent were elected and 34 percent were directly elected (22 percent in the previous session). The District People's Representative Conference of All Circles was established in 1950 and exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress in 1951. The number of representatives directly and indirectly elected has also increased with each session. In 1951, rural areas in the suburbs generally convened village (renamed township in 1953) People's Congresses.
    In the past few years, under the leadership of the Party and the government, the people of the capital have carried out a series of social reforms and production and construction work, their lives have been greatly improved, and their degree of organization and awareness have been greatly improved. Since June 1953, in accordance with the provisions of the "Election Law of the National People's Congress and Local People's Congresses at All Levels of the People's Republic of China," the city has conducted a magnificent general election. More than 92 percent of the total number of voters participated in the election, and if the voters who were temporarily away from home on the polling day were excluded, it reached 97 percent. This fully demonstrates the unity and high political enthusiasm of the people of all classes and ethnic groups in the capital. In 1954, the township, district, and municipal People's Congresses elected through general elections were convened successively. The first session of the Municipal People's Congress elected representatives to the National People's Congress, reviewed and approved the budget, final accounts, and work report of the Municipal People's Government, and made resolutions to support the draft constitution and support the liberation of Taiwan.
    Over the past five years, we have followed Chairman Mao's instruction that "All important work of the People's Government should be submitted to the People's Representative Conference for discussion and decision." All major work of the municipal, district, and township governments has been discussed and reviewed by the People's Representative Conference, and important issues related to the interests of the people of the city in each period have been resolved by the People's Representative Conference. The People's Representative Conferences of All Circles in various districts have more directly organized the people to overcome many difficulties in production and life with their own strength. For example, various specialized committees composed of representatives of the District People's Representative Conference of All Circles and street activists in urban districts mobilized and organized the masses to repair 70,000 to 80,000 dilapidated houses in 1950 alone. For example, at the joint meeting of the Municipal and District People's Representatives of All Circles, the issue of unified flour sales was fully discussed, a resolution was made, and all the representatives widely conveyed it among the people of all classes, so that the resolution of the Municipal and District People's Representatives of All Circles on the issue of unified flour sales was deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and became a unified action of the people of the city, smoothly completing the work of unified flour sales and laying the foundation for the implementation of the policy of planned purchase and planned supply of grain. The Municipal and District People's Governments have also taken a serious and responsible attitude to actively implement the proposals passed by the previous sessions of the Representative Conference, and have reported the implementation in detail at the meetings.
    The People's Representative Conference has also played a great role in supervising the government's implementation of the resolutions of the People's Representative Conference and inspecting and urging the government to improve its work. The government's budget and final accounts are submitted to the People's Representative Conference for review and approval; the work plans of the municipal, district, and township governments are also discussed and approved by the People's Representative Conference. Special reports have also been made on the work that should be done in accordance with the resolutions of the Representative Conference. At each meeting, the representatives fully demonstrated the spirit of being masters of their own affairs, frankly put forward various criticisms or suggestions, and played a great role in promoting the improvement of the work of the municipal, district, and township governments and the work style of the staff of state organs. For example, at the fourth session of the fourth Municipal People's Representative Conference of All Circles, the representatives sharply criticized the low quality of primary and secondary education in the city, and the responsible comrades of the Municipal People's Government and the educational administration departments made practical reviews at the meeting. The meeting made a resolution on improving the quality of primary and secondary education. After the meeting, a series of measures were taken to systematically solve the problems existing in the work of primary and secondary education.
    In order to maintain close contact with the people, listen to their opinions, and accept their supervision, the Municipal and District People's Governments have taken a serious and responsible attitude towards handling people's letters and receiving people's visits. The Municipal and District People's Governments and their subordinate units have full-time or part-time personnel responsible for this work, and many units have also established specialized institutions. The responsible comrades of various units generally attach importance to the work of people's letters and visits. Important letters and visits are mostly handled personally or received by responsible comrades. In 1953, the Municipal and District People's Governments and their subordinate units, starting from the shortcomings in the work reflected in the people's letters, launched a struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, deeply exposing shortcomings and systematically improving work. At present, the number of people's letters is increasing day by day. This shows that the result of seriously handling people's letters and visits has further brought into play the political enthusiasm of the people and further strengthened the ties between the government and the people.
    In the past five years, in the process of political power construction in Beijing, the people have further realized that they are truly the masters of the country by participating in the management of state affairs, and their enthusiasm and creativity in production, work, and study have been greatly improved. This makes us deeply realize that democracy is the source of strength. In the future, we will further improve the people's democratic system, overcome the shortcomings that still exist in the work of political power construction, and give full play to the role of political power in guaranteeing and promoting economic construction and various socialist transformation undertakings.

    北京市政权建设的成就
    马玉槐
    五年来，北京市各级政权组织和人民民主制度随着经济建设的逐渐发展和人民群众组织程度的日益提高，已逐步建立与健全起来。
    北京解放之初，军事管制委员会和市人民政府曾召开了工人、资本家、大学教授等各界人士和少数民族的座谈会，商讨全市工作中的重大问题。一九四九年八月，由军事管制委员会和市人民政府邀请了各界代表三百多人举行了协商性质的第一届各界人民代表会议。在这次会议上，毛主席亲自莅会作了重要指示：等到条件成熟，现在方式的各界人民代表会议，即可代行人民代表大会的职权。根据毛主席这一指示，经过积极准备，在同年十一月，北京市便召开了代行人民代表大会职权的第二届各界人民代表会议。到一九五四年六月止，市各界人民代表会议共召开了四届十二次。历届会议的代表人数都有增加，代表中由直接选举和间接选举产生的名额也逐届增多。第二届市各界人民代表会议的代表人数增加到四百二十四人，其中有百分之七十以上是由各人民团体选派的。第三届市各界人民代表会议，代表人数增至五百十九名，其中有百分之八十三点四的代表是由各界人民分别选举的。在选举中，公营工矿企业和专科以上学校已做到以生产或学校为单位，由选民大会直接选举；农民、妇女、工商界和区域代表等已普遍做到由选民代表会议选举。同时，在专科以上学校中，采用了无记名投票方式。这些方式都是当时群众所熟悉和感到便利的。第四届市各界人民代表会议，在前三届的基础上，又有不少进步和发展。代表总数增至五百五十五名，由选举产生的占百分之八十三点七，直接选举产生的占代表总数的百分之三十四（上届占百分之二十二）。区各界人民代表会议自一九五○年建立，并在一九五一年代行了人民代表大会的职权。直接选举和间接选举产生的代表也是逐届增加的。郊区农村在一九五一年即普遍召开了村（一九五三年改为乡）人民代表大会。
    几年来，首都人民在党和政府的领导下，进行了一系列的社会改革工作和生产建设工作，生活有了不少的改善，组织程度和觉悟程度有了很大的提高。一九五三年六月起，根据“中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会选举法”的规定，全市进行了规模壮阔的普选。参加选举的选民占选民总数的百分之九十二强，如将投票日临时外出的选民除去，则达百分之九十七。这充分表现了首都各阶层、各民族人民的团结一致和高涨的政治热情。一九五四年先后召开了用普选方式产生的乡、区、市人民代表大会会议，市人民代表大会第
  一次会议，选举了全国人民代表大会代表，审查批准了市人民政府的预算、决算和工作报告，并作出了拥护宪法草案、支援解放台湾等决议。
    五年来，我们遵照毛主席关于“人民政府的一切重要工作，都应交人民代表会议讨论，并做出决定。”的指示，市、区、乡各级政府的各项重大工作都经过人民代表会议的讨论和审查，每个时期与全市人民利益有关的重要问题都经人民代表会议作了决议。各区各界人民代表会议更直接组织人民用自己的力量克服了生产和生活中的许多困难。如城内各区由区各界人民代表会议代表和街道积极分子组成各种专门委员会，仅房屋修缮委员会在一九五○年就动员和组织群众修缮了七、八万间破漏房屋。又如，在市、区各界人民代表联席会议上，对面粉统销问题进行了充分讨论，作了决议，并由全体代表在各阶层人民中进行了广泛的传达，从而使市、区各界人民代表联席会议关于面粉统销问题的决议深入人心，成为全市人民的一致行动，顺利完成了面粉统销工作，并为实施粮食计划收购和计划供应政策打下了基础。市、区人民政府对历届各次代表会议所通过的提案，也都采取认真负责的态度积极执行，并在会议上详细报告了执行情况。
    人民代表会议在监督政府执行人民代表会议的决议，检查和督促政府改进工作方面也起了很大的作用。政府的预算和决算都提交人民代表会议审查和通过；市、区、乡各级政府的工作计划也都经人民代表会议讨论批准。对于代表会议决议应办的工作，也都做了专门的报告。在各次会议上，代表们充分表现了当家作主的精神，坦率地提出各种批评或建议，对于市、区、乡政府的工作和国家机关工作人员的工作作风的改进，起了很大的推动作用。例如，在第四届第四次市各界人民代表会议上，代表们对全市中、小学教育质量低的情况提出了尖锐的批评，市人民政府和教育行政部门的负责同志都在会上做了切实的检讨。会议作了关于提高中、小学教育质量的决议。会后采取了一系列措施，使中、小学教育工作中存在的问题得到了比较系统的解决。
    市、区人民政府为了经常保持同人民群众的密切联系，倾听群众的意见，接受群众的监督，对处理人民来信和接见人民来访的工作采取了认真负责的态度。市、区人民政府和所属各单位中，都设有负责此项工作的专职或兼职人员，不少单位还成立了专门机构。各单位的负责同志对人民来信、来访工作，一般是重视的。重要的来信、来访多由负责同志亲自处理或亲自接见。一九五三年，市、区人民政府和所属各单位从人民来信所反映的工作中的缺点着手，开展了反对官僚主义、反对命令主义和反对违法乱纪的斗争，深入地揭发缺点，系统地改进工作。目前，人民来信一天比一天更多起来。这说明认真处理人民来信、来访的结果，更加发挥了人民群众的政治积极性，更加密切了政府与人民的联系。
    五年来，北京市人民在政权建设过程中，由于参加了国家事务的管理，进一步体会到自己真正是国家的主人，因而在生产上、工作上、学习上的积极性和创造性大为提高。这使我们深深认识到民主是力量的源泉。今后我们将进一步健全人民民主制度，克服政权建设工作中尚存在的缺点，充分发挥政权对经济建设及各种社会主义改造事业的保障和推动作用。
