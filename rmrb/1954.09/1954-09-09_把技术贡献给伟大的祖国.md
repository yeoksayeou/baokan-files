Contribute Technology to the Great Motherland
Zhao Zhishi, Engineer of the Shanghai Xin Yu Joint State-Private Textile Factory

I. Recollections Before Joint Ownership

Before Liberation, those who were truly skilled and upright were discriminated against and ostracized, living in frustration. There's no need to elaborate on this. After Liberation, while the entire society underwent tremendous changes, technical personnel working in private enterprises were still severely constrained. Take the Xin Yu Textile Factory before joint ownership as an example. Although it had undergone a certain degree of transformation under the leadership of the Communist Party and the trade union in recent years, the capitalist nature of the enterprise remained unchanged. Technical personnel in the factory were still doing nominal administrative work, or wasting time in pointless personnel disputes. They simply lacked the energy and time to study technical and production issues.

Because the capitalists' management policy was entirely driven by the pursuit of profit, the entire enterprise was chaotic and unplanned. They did not pay attention to production and technology, let alone equipment improvement. They would accept any "task" that was profitable, and when they could not deliver the goods on time, they would desperately rush. If there were quality problems with the rushed goods, they would ask technical personnel to handle the negotiations. Sometimes, when technical personnel made suggestions to improve production, the capitalists would either emphasize the difficulties or be perfunctory. For example, Chen Zhengrong, an engineer in the cloth factory, proposed a rationalization suggestion to separate the automatic looms and ordinary looms in the loom area for the convenience of workers' operation. However, the capitalists used the excuse of "affecting production" and emphasized the difficulties, refusing to adopt it. Because there was no system in production management, unclear responsibilities, and disconnection between superiors and subordinates, everyone could manage everything, but no one managed anything. As a result, administrative leaders dared not take responsibility. Whoever accepted a job had no support from above and no response from below, left to fend for themselves. Technical personnel also lacked confidence in their work, and everyone adopted an attitude of "doing one day's work like ringing a bell for one day."

After the factory launched the Increase Production and Practice Economy campaign in October last year, production improved somewhat due to the correct leadership of the Communist Party, the assistance of the trade union and the Communist Youth League, and the efforts of all employees. Technical personnel also implemented some technical measures, but due to the lack of education among technical personnel, there were serious problems in their ideology and work style. They thought they "understood theory" and "had experience," looking down on everyone else. "I look down on you, you look down on me," each with their own way of doing things. They looked down on workers and did not value practical experience. They did not understand that the wisdom of the masses is the real wisdom. They verbally said they understood the importance of combining technology with labor, but in action, they still relied on their own subjective opinions or interests, took out their own set of methods, talked to a few veteran workers, or even implemented them without saying anything, without consulting the masses at all. They became complacent and proud when they achieved some results, boasting and exaggerating. When they encountered obstacles, they emphasized "objective reasons." Some technical personnel were ambitious and wanted to do big things instead of small things, trying to "make a name for themselves," but because what they did was not realistic, there were many measures, but they had little effect.

Our factory originally had quite a few senior technical personnel, all with a certain level of technical expertise. Logically, they should have done some practical technical work, but why couldn't they always achieve anything? On the one hand, of course, the individualism of the technical personnel themselves was at play. On the other hand, the more important reason was that the capitalist nature of the enterprise blocked our path. Therefore, most of the technical personnel had a common desire, hoping that the days of joint state-private ownership would come soon.

II. After the Nature of the Enterprise Changed

After the Xin Yu Textile Factory became a joint state-private enterprise in February this year, the situation fundamentally changed. The socialist component took a leading position. Under the leadership of state cadres, the irresponsible "passing the buck" style of the past was overcome, various systems were initially established, work was divided, responsibilities were clarified, and the planning of work was gradually strengthened. The past capitalist thinking of emphasizing quantity over quality was reversed, and the work of improving product quality was raised to the first place. As a result, technical work was valued, and technical personnel received the attention they deserved. Previously, the factory had a technical inspection team to study general technical work, but it was understaffed and had little effect. After joint ownership, the leadership concentrated a large number of technical personnel who were busy with administrative work to work in the team. At the same time, many cadres were promoted in the workshops to take on administrative work. This allowed technical personnel in both the workshops and the technical inspection team to concentrate their efforts on studying technology. The leadership actively supported the correct suggestions of the technical personnel. For example, the technical personnel in the cotton cleaning workshop repeatedly suggested setting up a "cotton drying room" to dry the cotton in order to remove impurities, but the capitalists had always ignored it. After joint ownership, the leadership carefully studied and supported the technical personnel's opinion. It is now nearing completion and will soon be in use. The improvement of the arrangement of automatic looms and ordinary looms in the loom area has also been implemented. For example, there were many "oil-stained cloths" in the cloth factory, so the technical personnel formulated a set of operating rules. At first, we were worried that it would not work, but the leadership told us that as long as we patiently consulted with the workers, it would definitely work. As a result, it was done very well. In short, technical personnel are now not "heroes without a place to use their skills," but are only afraid of having no "skills" to use.

At the same time, state cadres constantly and patiently educated and enlightened us technical personnel through large and small meetings, pointing out the role and direction of efforts that technical personnel should play in the national transition period, establishing the idea of serving the people, criticizing our past various incorrect ideas, emphasizing that technology cannot be separated from politics and the masses. Only under the guidance of correct political ideology, relying on the masses, and believing in the masses, "making technology and labor combine," can technology continue to progress and develop. The factory also established various technical meeting systems. Through the weekly technical research meetings for all technical personnel in the factory, as well as the technical research group meetings for technical personnel and veteran workers in each workshop, we were mobilized to study various technical problems, encouraged to learn advanced experience, and organized to visit various factories. One technical personnel said with emotion: "In the past, it seemed like being in a muddy pool, and everyone thought they were a big fish. Now that the pool water is clear, I realize that I am just a small fish among many fish. We need to learn seriously and rely on the masses to succeed."

After joint ownership, a new atmosphere appeared in the Xin Yu Textile Factory. Take our technical personnel as an example. Our thinking and work style have undergone preliminary changes, especially in the strengthening of unity between technical personnel and workers, and the gradual combination of technology and labor. Now we often listen to the opinions of workers through various forums, consult with veteran workers humbly, and often discover shortcomings in our work through reporting meetings, criticizing and correcting each other. Once, technical personnel heard about the advanced experience of other factories regarding fiber separators. After returning, they also wanted to modify four fiber separators, but many specific problems were difficult to solve. They consulted with Wang Yuren, a veteran worker in the cotton cleaning workshop, and jointly formulated a plan and prepared well to test the modification of the original machine. As a result, the output increased by 50%, and the impurity content decreased from 3.92% to 1.98%, which played a significant role in reducing the yarn breakage rate and saving cotton. After this cooperation, the technical personnel felt that "book knowledge cannot solve problems if it is not combined with the practical experience of workers." For example, some of the weft winding machines in the loom preparation workshop were circular, resulting in a small shuttle capacity, which affected the loom workers' ability to monitor the looms, and the weavers were dissatisfied. Veteran worker Wu Zaifu used his brains to try to enlarge the forming to increase the yarn capacity, but he had an idea in his mind that he could not express in words. After the technical personnel participated in the research, designed drawings, and successfully modified it, the capacity increased by 20%, which was greatly welcomed by the weavers. Each shuttle can weave three inches more cloth, saving labor and reducing the stop rate. After this cooperation, the veteran workers also felt that their theoretical knowledge was poor and that they must cooperate with the technical personnel in the future. Under the principle of "combining technology with labor," a series of operating systems and technical measures were implemented, which played a significant role in improving product quality. According to the statistics in April, the yarn breakage rate of 20-count yarn was previously around 300 breaks, but in April it had been reduced to below 170 breaks. The 42-count yarn had also been reduced from 450 breaks to around 170 breaks. From the perspective of product quality, all 20-count yarn reached grade A in April.

However, there has recently been a phenomenon of fluctuating production. Under the call of the leadership, all employees of the factory have expressed their determination to improve further, not to be complacent or slack, and to ensure that they fight another beautiful battle in production. After a period of work and study and discussion of the draft Constitution after joint ownership, the technical personnel have initially clarified the important responsibilities of technical personnel to the country and the people. The enterprise has been transformed, and we have also received education. Our work is intense, and our spirit is happy. In the old enterprises of the past, our technology was being wasted day by day. Now? Under the shining light of the General Line, we have embarked on a bright path, gained the attention of the country and the support of the masses, and our technology is constantly improving. In the future, we must contribute our technology better to the great motherland.

    把技术贡献给伟大的祖国
    公私合营上海新裕纺织厂工程师　赵砥士
    一、合营前的回忆
    解放前，真正有技术和正直的人，都受到歧视和排挤，在苦闷中过日子，这已经不需要多说；解放后，整个社会固然有了极大的变革，但在私营企业中工作的技术人员，仍然受着严重的束缚。拿合营前的新裕纺织厂来说，几年来在共产党和工会领导下，虽获得一定程度的改造，但是由于企业的资本主义性质没有改变，技术人员在工厂里仍不过做些名不符实的事务工作，或是在无谓的人事纠纷中浪费时间，根本没有精力和时间来研究技术和生产上的问题。
    由于资本家的经营方针完全是从唯利是图的目的出发，以致整个企业混乱而无计划，对生产和技术不加重视，更谈不到设备上的改进，只要是有利可图的“任务”，就接受下来，到期交不出货，就拚命催赶，赶出来的货色质量上有问题，就叫技术人员去办交涉。有时技术人员为改进生产提出建议，资方不是强调困难，就是敷衍了事，比如布厂工程师陈正荣，提出一个合理化建议，要把布机间的自动布机与普通布机改为分开排列，以便于工人操作，但是资方借口“影响生产”、强调困难，不予采用。由于生产管理上没有制度，职责不明，上下脱节，事事人人可管，而又人人不管，弄得行政领导人员不敢负责，谁接受一件工作，上无支援、下无响应，听你自生自灭。技术人员也没有工作信心，大家都抱着“做一天和尚撞一天钟”的态度。
    去年十月厂里展开增产节约运动以后，由于共产党的正确领导、工会、青年团的协助和全体职工的努力，生产有了些提高；技术人员也搞了些技术措施，可是由于技术人员缺少教育，不论思想上、作风上都存在着严重的问题，自以为“懂理论”、“有经验”，目空一切，我看不起你，你看不起我，各有一套、各搞一套，看不起工人，不重视实地经验，不懂得团结大家来搞好工作，更不懂得群众的智慧才是真正的智慧，口头上说懂得技术与劳动相结合的重要性，行动上仍是凭各人主观或兴趣，拿出自己的一套，找几个老师傅说一说，甚至不说就硬搬下去，根本不跟群众商量。有了些成绩就沾沾自喜，骄傲自满，自说自夸，遇了点阻碍就强调“客观原因”。有些技术人员好高骛远，搞大不搞小，企图“一鸣惊人”，可是因为搞的不切合实际，因此措施虽多，作用不大。
    我们厂里高级技术人员本来不算少，都有一定技术水平，照理应该切切实实搞些技术工作，但为什么总是搞不出名堂呢？一方面当然是技术人员本身的个人主义在作怪。另一方面，更主要的原因是企业的资本主义性质挡住了我们的去路。因此大部分的技术人员都有着一个共同的愿望，盼望公私合营的日子早日到来。
    二、企业性质改变以后
    今年二月新裕纺织厂公私合营后，情况就根本改变了，社会主义成分居于领导地位，在国家干部的领导下，克服了过去资方不负责任的“踢皮球”作风，初步建立了各种制度，进行了分工，职责分清，工作逐步增强了计划性，扭转了过去资方重量不重质的思想，将改进产品质量的工作，提高到第一位。由此技术工作被重视了，技术人员也得到了应有的重视。以前厂里原设有技术检验组，研究一般性技术工作，但人力不够，作用不大。合营后，领导上将大量忙于事务工作的技术人员，集中到组里来工作，同时在车间里也提拔了很多干部担任行政工作。这样就使得不论车间或者技术检验组的技术人员都能集中精力，研究技术。领导上积极地支持技术人员正确的建议。例如清花间的技术人员，在合营前一再建议设置“烘棉间”，将棉花烘干以便于清除杂质，资方一直不闻不问，但合营后经过领导上慎重研究，支持了技术人员的意见，现在将近完工，不久即可使用。布机间改善自动布机与普通布机的排列也付之实施了。又如布厂里“油污布”数量多，技术人员就订出一套操作规则，起初我们顾虑行不通，领导上告诉我们只要耐心跟工人商量，一定会行得通，结果果然做得很好。总之技术人员现在已不是“英雄无用武之地”，而是只怕无“武”可用了。
    同时，国家干部经常通过大会小会，对我们技术人员不断地耐心教育和启发，指出技术人员在国家过渡时期应起的作用和努力的方向，树立为人民服务的思想，批判了我们过去种种不正确的思想，强调技术不能脱离政治、脱离群众，只有在正确的政治思想指导下，依靠群众、相信群众，“使技术与劳动相结合”，技术才能不断进步和发挥。厂内并建立了各种技术会议制度，通过每星期的全厂技术人员技术研究会，以及各车间技术人员与老师傅的技术研究组会议，发动我们研究各种技术问题，鼓励我们学习先进经验，又组织我们到各厂参观。一位技术人员感动地说：“过去好像在一个混水池里，个个都以为自己是一条大鱼，现在池水清了，才知道自己是很多鱼里面一条小鱼。我们需要认真学习，依靠群众才行。”
    合营以后，新裕纺织厂出现了新气象。就拿我们技术人员来说，思想和作风都有了初步转变，特别表现在技术人员和工人的团结加强了，技术与劳动逐步结合起来了。现在我们经常通过各种座谈会听取工人同志的意见，跟老师傅虚心商量研究，并经常通过汇报会发现工作上的缺点，互相批评与纠正。有一次技术人员听了别厂关于纤维分离机的先进经验，回来后也想改装四台纤维分离机，但有许多具体问题难以解决，就与清花间老师傅王裕仁商量，共同订好计划，做好准备，将原机试行改装，结果产量提高了百分之五十，含杂率由百分之三·九二降至百分之一·九八，这对断头率的减少及节约用棉起了很大作用。经过这次合作，技术人员感到“书本知识如果不与工人的实际经验相结合，是不能解决问题的”。再如布机准备间有一部分纬纱机是圆形的，做成纾子容量不多，影响了织布工看台力，挡车工都不满意，老师傅吴再福动脑筋想把成形改大，增加纱的容量，但是心里有一套，嘴里讲不出来，经过技术人员参加研究，设计绘图，改造成功，容量增加百分之二十，织布工大大欢迎，每只纾子可多织三吋布，节省了劳动力，降低了停台率。经过这次合作，老师傅也感到自己理论差，今后一定要与技术人员合作才行。在“技术与劳动相结合”的方针下，贯彻了一连串的操作制度和技术措施，对提高产品质量起了很大的作用。根据四月份的统计，以往二十支纱的断头率在三百根左右，四月份已降低至一百七十根以下，四十二支纱也由四百五十根降低至一百七十根左右，从产品质量上来看，四月份全部达到甲级纱。
    但最近生产上仍存在着忽高忽低现象，全厂职工在领导的号召下，都表示决心好上加好，不自满、不松劲，保证在生产上再打一个漂亮仗。技术人员经过合营以后一段时期的工作、学习和宪法草案的讨论，已初步明确了技术人员对国家对人民的重大责任。企业改造了，我们也受到了教育。我们的工作是紧张的，而我们的精神是愉快的。在以往的旧企业中，我们的技术是一天天地荒芜下去，现在呢？我们在总路线的光辉照耀下，走上了光明大道，获得了国家的重视和群众的支持，我们技术正在不断提高，今后我们一定要把技术更好地贡献给伟大的祖国。
