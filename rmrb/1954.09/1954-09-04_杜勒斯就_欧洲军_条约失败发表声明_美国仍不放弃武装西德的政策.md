Xinhua News Agency, Washington, September 2nd: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles issued a statement on August 31st regarding the French National Assembly's rejection of the "European Defense Community" treaty.

Dulles said in the statement: "France's rejection of the European Defense Community is a sad thing." He said that French nationalism was "showing off its power" and "this is a tragedy." Dulles expressed in the statement the U.S.'s determination to continue its war policy in Europe. He said the following facts are "immutable": the United States is determined to rearm West Germany; the United States wants to drive the rearmed West German army to serve the U.S.'s aggressive policies; the United States wants to unilaterally restore West German "sovereignty" so that the Adenauer puppet regime can join the U.S.-led military aggression bloc; limit the sovereignty of other Western European countries and incorporate certain functions of Western European governments into "supranational organizations" to facilitate U.S. control.

Dulles said that the U.S.'s post-war policy since 1946 has been formulated based on the assumption of organizing Western European countries into a military alliance. He said: Now that "France has made this negative decision," the United States must "re-evaluate its foreign policy, especially its policy towards Europe." Dulles said: "The United States should examine its deployments and plans in accordance with the new situation that has now formed," and "the United States believes that a meeting of the North Atlantic Council should be convened immediately, and consultations should be held with Adenauer as soon as possible" to intensify measures to rearm West Germany after the collapse of the "European Defense Community" plan. According to United Press International, the United States "will be determined to formulate ways for West Germany to quickly rearm under the banner of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." Washington officials believe that the United States will ask the North Atlantic Council to invite West Germany to join the alliance as a formal member.

    杜勒斯就“欧洲军”条约失败发表声明
    美国仍不放弃武装西德的政策
    【新华社二日讯】华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯八月三十一日就法国国民议会拒绝“欧洲防务集团”条约发表声明。
    杜勒斯在声明中说：“法国拒绝欧洲防务集团是一件令人伤心的事。”他说，法国的民族主义在“大显露威风”，“这是一个悲剧”。杜勒斯在声明中表示了美国继续在欧洲执行战争政策的决心。他说下列事实是“难以更改”的，这些事实是：美国决心要重新武装西德，美国要驱使重新武装起来的西德军队为美国的侵略政策服务；美国要片面恢复西德“主权”，以便使阿登纳傀儡政权加入美国主持的军事侵略集团；限制西欧其他国家的主权，把西欧国家政府的某些机能并入“超国家组织”以便于美国的控制。
    杜勒斯说，一九四六年以来的美国战后政策是根据这样一个假定拟定的，这个假定就是把西欧国家组织在一个军事联盟之内。他说：现在“法国作出了这个否定的决定”，美国要“重新估计它的外交政策，特别是它对欧洲的政策。”杜勒斯说：“美国应该按照现在形成的新情势来检查它的部署和计划”，“美国认为应该立即召开北大西洋联盟理事会会议，并应及早和阿登纳磋商”在“欧洲防务集团”计划破产之后加紧重新武装西德的措施。据合众社的消息说：美国“将决心拟定西德在北大西洋公约组织的旗帜下迅速重新武装起来的办法。”华盛顿的官员认为：美国将要求北大西洋联盟理事会邀请西德参加联盟为正式成员国。
