To Vice Chairman Zhu, Premier Zhou, leaders of the Central People's Government, and esteemed guests:

    The first session of the First National People's Congress is about to be convened in Beijing, the capital of our motherland, a joyous occasion for the people of the entire nation. From Tibet, I, along with the Panchen Erdeni, and other representatives and staff, although coming from a remote border region, have had a smooth journey thanks to the concern of Chairman Mao and the leaders of the Central Government, the direct assistance of General Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government, and the brotherly welcome and hospitality of the People's Governments at all levels and the broad masses of the people. Yesterday, upon arriving in Beijing, we were honored with a warm welcome from Vice Chairman Zhu, Premier Zhou, leaders of the Central Government, representatives of people's organizations and various institutions. Today, we are further honored by a welcoming banquet hosted by Vice Chairman Zhu. We extend our heartfelt gratitude and highest respect.

    The National People's Congress will formulate China's constitution, an unprecedented and momentous event in history. We are able to represent the Tibetan people in the Congress, meet with the leaders of the Central Government, and especially to meet with Chairman Mao, the great leader of all ethnic groups, which is the most glorious and exciting event of my life.

    We traveled from Lhasa to Beijing for nearly two months, and we deeply felt the vast territory of the motherland, the large population, and the abundance of resources. In the few years since liberation, thanks to the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the country's various construction projects have achieved unparalleled and great achievements. In particular, along the way we saw that the People's Governments at all levels, in accordance with Chairman Mao's policies of equality, unity among nationalities, and freedom of religious belief, protected the freedom of religious belief of all ethnic groups, and implemented ethnic regional autonomy for minority nationalities, thereby fundamentally transforming the relations among and within the various nationalities from the oppression and hatred of the reactionary rule of old China into fraternal relations of love and cooperation. This fully demonstrates the great victory of Chairman Mao's nationality and religious policies. We will humbly learn from all aspects in order to develop the Tibetan nationality.

    Taking Tibet as an example, in the past, imperialism had sown discord between Tibet and the motherland. However, since the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949, Chairman Mao's radiance has shone all over China, thereby enabling the Tibetan people to achieve peaceful liberation in 1951. In the three years since then, under the kind care of Chairman Mao, and under the guidance and assistance of General Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government, as well as the People's Liberation Army and staff stationed in Tibet, the political, economic, cultural and other aspects of Tibet have changed, gradually embarking on the road to happiness and well-being, and the unity between the Tibetan nationality and other fraternal nationalities, especially between the Han and Tibetan nationalities, as well as within the Tibetan nationality, has become increasingly close. In the future, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, I, the Panchen Erdeni, and the Tibetan religious and secular staff and people will unite even more closely to strive for the construction of a new Tibet, the consolidation of national defense, and the improvement of people's lives.

    First, I ask everyone to raise their glasses to the health of Vice Chairman Zhu, Premier Zhou, and all leaders.

    Cheers to the great unity of all nationalities in China.

    Long live the Communist Party of China, and cheers to the peace, unity, prosperity, and strength of our great motherland.

    Long live Chairman Mao!

    达赖喇嘛的答词朱副主席、周总理、中央人民政府各位首长、各位先生：
    在祖 国的首都北京即将召开第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，这是全国人民的一件大喜事。西藏方面，我和班禅额尔德尼，以及其他代表和工作人员，虽然来自遥远的边疆，但在毛主席和中央各位首长的关切下，在中央人民政府代表张经武将军的直接帮助下，各级人民政府和广大人民兄弟般的欢迎和招待，沿途都很顺利。昨天到达北京的时候，更承蒙朱副主席，周总理和中央各位首长，各人民团体和各机关代表的热烈欢迎，今天又蒙朱副主席设宴欢迎，我们敬致衷心的感谢和崇高的敬礼。
    全国人民代表大会将制定我国的宪法，这是历史上空前未有的重大事情。我们能代表西藏人民参加大会，晋见中央各位首长，尤其晋见各民族人民的伟大领袖毛主席，这是我一生最光荣最感兴奋的一件事。
    我们这次从拉萨出发来京，一共走了将近两个月，深深感到祖国的幅员广大，人口众多，物产丰富。在解放的几年当中，由于毛主席的英明领导，国家的各种建设，取得了不可比拟的伟大成就。尤其在沿途看到各级人民政府根据毛主席的民族平等团结政策和宗教信仰自由政策，保护了各民族的信教自由，少数民族实行了民族区域自治，从而使各民族间和民族内部的关系，从旧中国反动统治时期的压迫和仇视，从根本上一变而为友爱合作的兄弟关系。这充分表现了毛主席民族政策和宗教政策的伟大胜利。我们将从各方面虚心地进行学习，以便使西藏民族得到发展。
    拿西藏来说，在以前一个时期内，帝国主义曾经挑拨离间西藏与祖国的关系。但从一九四九年十月一日中华人民共和国成立后，由于毛主席的光辉普照了全中国，从而使西藏人民也于一九五一年得到了和平解放。在三年多的时间内，在毛主席的亲切关怀下，在中央人民政府代表张经武将军以及进藏人民解放军和工作人员的指导和帮助下，使西藏的政治、经济、文化等各方面都改变了面貌，逐渐走上幸福康乐的大道，使西藏民族与各兄弟民族间，尤其汉藏民族间以及西藏民族内部的团结日益走向亲密。今后在毛主席的英明领导下，我和班禅额尔德尼以及西藏僧俗工作人员、僧俗人民将更加亲密团结起来，为建设新西藏、巩固祖国国防、改善人民生活而奋斗。
    我首先请大家为朱副主席、周总理和各位首长的身体健康而干杯。
    为中国各民族的大团结而干杯。
    为中国共产党万岁，为我们的伟大祖国和平、统一、富强而干杯。
    为毛主席万寿无疆而干杯。
