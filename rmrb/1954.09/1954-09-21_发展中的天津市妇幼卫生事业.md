The maternal and child health work in Tianjin has achieved remarkable results since the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Before liberation, all material civilization in Tianjin was only for the enjoyment of imperialists, compradores, bureaucrats, and other wealthy and powerful minorities. The only obstetrics hospital and some municipal and private hospitals with obstetrics departments were located in the city center or foreign concessions, and more than half of the midwives were also concentrated in these areas. Midwife Li Shuxuan remembers an incident: one night, someone came to ask Dean Deng of a private hospital where she used to work to deliver a baby for a parturient woman in critical condition due to dystocia; at that moment, Li Yuanhong's car arrived to pick up Dean Deng to deliver a baby for the "young mistress." The family of the parturient woman begged the dean, but the dean left without answering and drove away. This was not the worst encounter, because more working women, whether in normal or difficult labor, never even considered asking a midwife for help. When giving birth, they could only find "laolao" (old-style birth attendants) or manage on their own. Disease and death constantly threatened mothers and infants. Mothers who survived often suffered from various illnesses. In those years, childbirth brought untold suffering to women, especially working women. Factories were unwilling to hire working women with children. Working women were often fired after becoming pregnant and giving birth. Shen Huiping, a worker at the Tianjin Clothing Factory, was fired by the factory when she had her first child. Later, she managed to get her job back, but she had to secretly bring her child to the factory every day and hide it next to the piles of clothing. Once, the piles of clothing collapsed and almost killed the child. Even if the children of the working people managed to survive, they often suffered from rickets or were emaciated.

Now, in addition to well-equipped obstetrics hospitals, maternal and child health hospitals, and children's hospitals in Tianjin, fifteen maternal and child health stations have been established in factories with a large number of female workers. Female workers are no longer fired when they become pregnant; instead, they receive special protection. Shen Huiping said:
	"After liberation, when I became pregnant, the factory leaders immediately assigned me lighter work and arranged for regular prenatal check-ups at the workers' hospital. I also received fifty-six days of maternity leave before and after childbirth, with full pay. Now, my older child is in the factory's children's school, and my younger child is in the nursery. Every night, I listen to my older child telling stories and my younger child babbling, and I feel indescribably happy!" The daily hygiene of female workers has also greatly improved, and the incidence of diseases among female workers has significantly decreased. In 1950, more than 54% of female workers in Tianjin's textile factories suffered from "dysmenorrhea"; this spring, it has been reduced to 18%. This has greatly improved the attendance rate of female workers in various factories. In a workshop of the No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, 124 female workers suffered from dysmenorrhea. Among them, 57 had to take leave or stop working every time they menstruated. After health education and the establishment of female workers' health rooms, 53 no longer took leave, and the symptoms of dysmenorrhea were alleviated in others. In addition, the No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory piloted an amateur sanatorium for menstrual disorders this year. The trial results showed a 100% effectiveness rate and a cure rate of over 61%, further reducing absenteeism. Other factories with suitable conditions are also preparing to implement this type of sanatorium.

Not only female workers, but all women and infants in the city have received the care and protection of the state. Ten central maternal and child health stations have been established in various districts, thirty-two joint health stations in various streets and alleys, eighteen medical stations, and one child health center, forming a city-wide maternal and child health network. In 1953, the proportion of parturient women in Tianjin who received modern midwifery had increased from 33% before liberation to over 91%. Of the more than 88,000 parturient women in the past year, less than one in ten thousand died. To further alleviate the physiological pain of parturient women, hospitals have been experimenting with the Soviet Union's advanced medical experience - painless childbirth - for some parturient women. More than 304,000 infants and young children in the city have been vaccinated with BCG and smallpox, and have received diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus vaccinations. These measures have ensured the health of infants and young children.

How were these significant achievements achieved? In the early days of liberation, facing the deformed remnants of a colonial city, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government's health department began to carry out maternal and child health work. The first step was to solve the problem of modern midwifery to ensure the safety of mothers and infants. This first required reforming the "laolao" and midwives, and organizing them to study. After professional training, many "laolao" understood some basic knowledge of maternal and child health and initially learned the new midwifery methods, becoming new birth attendants; after political study, the midwives also initially established the concept of serving the people, and many midwives voluntarily reduced their delivery fees, going out in all kinds of weather to deliver babies for the broad masses of women.

As the maternal and child health work developed, the demand for modern midwifery increased day by day. The problem of uneven distribution of midwives became more prominent. The masses often reflected: "The doctors live in the city center, too far away from us; by the time the doctors arrive, the baby has already been born." At the same time, some birth attendants were not skilled enough and hoped to receive guidance from midwives. Based on the opinions of the masses, the People's Government mobilized midwives to move to areas lacking delivery personnel to establish joint health stations. Subsequently, with the help of the People's Government, ten joint health stations, including the Wandezhuang station in the Seventh District, were established. When the midwives first arrived in Wandezhuang, tricycle workers voluntarily helped them move their belongings and refused to accept payment; the masses actively helped find the most suitable houses for the station's address. To further solve the problem of uneven distribution of midwives, the People's Government's health department and the Women's Federation also led the delivery personnel to establish a district-based delivery responsibility system, and the People's Government allocated and supplemented a large number of newly trained midwives in areas where midwives were insufficient.

As work developed, new problems emerged. Because the liaison and division of labor between midwives and hospitals were poor, the hospital beds were occupied by normal parturient women, and when midwives sent women with dystocia, they could not be admitted due to lack of space; even if they were admitted, they were discharged quickly, and accidents were likely to occur for the parturient women and newborns. The People's Government's health department then piloted a division of labor and responsibility system for obstetrics and health institutions. The hospital mainly admitted women with dystocia and provided professional guidance to factory and street maternal and child health institutions. When women with dystocia were discharged from the hospital, the hospital notified the local midwives to make visits and provide care. Gradually, comprehensive responsibility was achieved for pregnant women, parturient women, and newborns.

    发展中的天津市妇幼卫生事业
    康凌
    中华人民共和国成立以来，天津市的妇幼卫生工作获得了显著的成绩。
    解放前的天津，一切物质文明只供帝国主义者、买办、官僚和其他有钱有势的少数人享受。仅有的一所产科医院和一些附设有产科的市立、私立医院都设在市中心区或外国租借地，半数以上的助产士也都集中在这些地区。助产士李淑萱记得，曾经有这样一件事：一天夜晚，有人来请她过去工作过的一家私人医院的邓院长去为一个命在旦夕的难产妇接生；正在这时，黎元洪家的汽车来了，接邓院长去给“少奶奶”接生。那位难产妇家的人苦苦哀求这位院长，但是院长没有任何回答便上了汽车扬长而去。这不能算是顶坏的遭遇，因为更多的劳动妇女生孩子时无论顺产或难产，根本连想也没有想过要去请助产士。生孩子的时候只能找“姥姥”（旧式收生婆）收生，有的就自己收拾。疾病和死亡随时威胁着产妇和婴儿。幸免死亡的产妇往往落得一身病。在那样的年月，生孩子不知带给妇女特别是劳动妇女多少灾难。工厂不愿意收有孩子的女工。女工怀孕、生孩子以后常常要被开除。天津被服厂女工申慧萍有第一个孩子的时候，就被当时的厂方赶了出来。后来她到处托人情才又上了工，但每天要偷偷把孩子带到厂里藏在被服垛旁边。有一次，被服垛倒了险些把孩子砸死。那时劳动人民的孩子即或挣扎着活过来，不是害软骨病就是骨瘦如柴。
    现在天津市内除了有设备完善的妇产科医院、妇幼保健院和儿童医院以外，在女工较多的工厂，先后设立了十五个妇幼保健站。女工怀孕再也不会被开除，而是要受到特别的保护了。申慧萍说：
  “解放以后我怀了孕，厂里领导干部知道了马上给调换轻活，并且定期到职工医院作产前检查，产前产后还有五十六天产假，工资照发。现在，我的大孩子已经进了职工子弟学校，小孩子进了托儿所。每天晚上，我听着大孩子讲这讲那，小孩子伊伊呀呀地学话，心里有说不出的高兴！”女工的日常卫生也有很大改善，女工的疾病显著减少了。一九五○年，天津市各纺织工厂有百分之五十四以上的女工患“痛经病”，今年春天已经降低到百分之十八。因为这，大大提高了各工厂女工的出勤率。棉纺二厂二纺厂的一个车间，女工中有痛经病的一百二十四人。其中五十七人每次来月经都要歇班或下车。经过卫生教育和建立女工卫生室以后，有五十三人不歇班了，其他人的痛经症状减轻了。另外，在棉纺六厂今年还试办了月经病业余疗养所。试办结果有效率达到百分之百，痊愈率是百分之六十一以上，进一步减少了欠勤现象。其他有条件的工厂也正在准备推行这种疗养办法。
    不仅女工，全市的妇女和婴儿都受到了国家的关怀和保护。各区设立了十个中心妇幼保健站，各街巷设立了三十二个联合保健站，十八个医疗站和一个儿童保健所，形成了一个遍及全市的妇幼保健网。一九五三年，天津全市享受到新法接生的产妇已由解放前的百分之三十三增加到百分之九十一以上，去年一年临产的八万八千多名产妇中死亡的不到万分之一。为了进一步减轻产妇生理上的痛苦，医院在一部分产妇中试行了苏联先进医疗经验——无痛分娩法。全市婴儿、幼儿接种过卡介苗的有三十万四千多人，并普遍种了牛痘，注射了白喉、百日咳和破伤风的预防针。这些措施，保证了婴、幼儿的健康。
    显著的成绩是怎样得来的呢？解放初期，面临着殖民地化城市畸形的残迹，天津市人民政府卫生部门就开始进行妇幼保健工作了。第一步是解决关于产妇和婴儿生命安全的新法接生问题。这首先就要改造“姥姥”和助产士，组织她们学习。经过业务学习，许多“姥姥”懂得了一些妇幼卫生常识，初步学会了新接生法，成了新的接生员；经过政治学习，助产士也初步树立了为人民服务的观念，许多助产士自动降低了接生费，风来雨去地为广大妇女群众接生。
    随着妇幼卫生事业的开展，要求用新法接生的一天比一天多起来。助产士分布不平衡的问题表现更突出了。群众常反映：“大夫住在市中心区，离我们太远；大夫来了，孩子早生下来了。”同时有些接生员技术不熟练，也希望能得到助产士的指教。人民政府根据群众的意见，就动员助产士搬到缺少接生人员的地区去建立联合保健站。接着在人民政府的帮助下，七区万德庄等十个联合保健站就建立起来了。助产士刚到万德庄的时候，三轮车工人自动地帮她们搬运东西，不要她们付车费；群众都积极地帮助找最合适的房子作站址。为了进一步解决助产士分布不平衡的问题，人民政府卫生部门和妇联又领导接生人员建立了分片接生负责制，助产士不够的地方，就由人民政府调配补充大批新培养的助产士。
    工作发展了，新的问题又出现了。因为助产士和医院的联系、分工做得差，医院里被平产妇占去了床位，助产士再送难产妇时，由于没地方住再送不进去；即使送进去了，出院也很快，产妇和新生儿容易发生意外。人民政府卫生部门又试行了产科保健机构的分工负责制。医院主要收容难产妇，并对工厂、街道妇幼卫生机构进行业务指导。难产妇出院的时候，医院就通知本地区的助产士去作访问和护理。逐渐做到对孕妇、产妇和新生儿的全面负责。（附图片）
