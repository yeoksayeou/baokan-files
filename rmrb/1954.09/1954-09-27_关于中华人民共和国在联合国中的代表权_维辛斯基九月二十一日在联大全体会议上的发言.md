Please allow me, on behalf of the Soviet delegation, to extend my greetings to our temporary Chairman and to thank her for her warm speech to the current session of the General Assembly. At the same time, please allow me, on behalf of the Soviet Union, to extend my greetings to the representatives attending the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly and wish them success in their work on solving the important issues on the agenda of the Assembly.

Madam Pandit rightly pointed out here that the current session is opening under conditions of a certain degree of relaxation of international tensions. Undoubtedly, this is largely due to the convening of the Berlin Four-Power Conference and the Geneva Conference. The Geneva Conference was attended by foreign ministers from the United States, the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China, which has achieved legitimate great-power status, as well as representatives from other relevant countries.

I believe it is necessary to explain this issue before the General Assembly begins its organizational work, with particular emphasis on the details I will describe later.

It is undeniable that the Geneva Conference took a major step in easing international tensions: the bloody Indochina War, which lasted nearly eight years, has been stopped, and peace has been restored in Indochina. At the same time, the Geneva Conference confirmed the correctness of the principle insisted upon by the Soviet Union and several other countries: that major issues of maintaining peace and international security cannot be resolved without the participation of the great power, the People's Republic of China.

The positive contribution made by China's participation in the Geneva Conference is now universally recognized. The noble initiative shown by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in ending the Korean War and signing the armistice agreement, with the support of the Soviet Union, is also well known. The talks between Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China and Prime Minister Nehru of India, and between Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister U Nu of Burma, in June of this year showed that these largest Asian countries have reached an understanding on their joint efforts to strengthen peace in Southeast Asia and the world.

The current session of the General Assembly faces important tasks, and the people of the world are expecting these tasks to be completed. Our temporary Chairman, Madam Pandit, is absolutely right to emphasize this.

Our Charter requires the United Nations to fulfill its obligations in accordance with the principles of justice and international law, to promote friendly relations among nations, and to serve as a center for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of common ends.

We have no doubt that the United Nations can only fulfill its duties, its responsibility to all mankind to strengthen international security and consolidate world peace, by strictly observing the provisions of the Charter.

However, it must be admitted that the majority in the General Assembly frequently violate these requirements. As everyone knows, the national liberation struggle waged by the Chinese people had already achieved complete and final victory throughout the country in 1949. This was a great and historically significant victory that fundamentally changed the situation in Asian countries. Over the past five years, China has followed a glorious path of historical development. Under the leadership of the Central People's Government, the Chinese people have worked hard to build a new life in which the welfare of the people is truly the supreme law. Under the leadership of their people's government, 600 million Chinese people are successfully building a new life and making their contributions to strengthening international relations based on friendly cooperation and to the cause of defending peace and international security.

Gentlemen, is it not absurd that the great Chinese people, numbering more than 600 million, are still not represented in the international organization—the United Nations—which claims to be responsible for strengthening the friendly ties between peoples, and that China's legal status in the United Nations is still occupied by representatives of the Kuomintang clique who have been driven out of the country? This situation is a disgrace to the United Nations.

This situation undermines its international prestige and undermines people's respect and trust in the United Nations as an international organization. This situation is intolerable in any way. This situation is detrimental to the interests of all peace-loving people and deprives our organization—which it calls the United Nations—of the opportunity to make valuable contributions to consolidating world peace and international security. The absence of the People's Republic of China has had an adverse effect on the work of important bodies such as the Security Council. According to the United Nations Charter, China is a permanent member of the Security Council, but its seat on the Security Council is illegally occupied by a representative who has neither the right nor the ability to represent anyone. I repeat, this situation is intolerable in any way. The United Nations cannot ignore the demands of the broad public and political figures around the world. They demand that such a blatant injustice be corrected, that such a lawless phenomenon be corrected: depriving the People's Republic of China of its legitimate right to attend the United Nations and to attend important bodies such as the Security Council within the United Nations.

Many prominent politicians in many countries advocate restoring China's legitimate rights in the United Nations, including the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, Norway, Denmark, Iceland, and Sweden.

All this shows that a very wide range of the public in all countries recognizes the importance of China's participation in international affairs and recognizes that the United Nations cannot be considered an authoritative international organization when one of the great powers, the People's Republic of China, is excluded.

If it were not for the obstruction of the United States, one of the great powers, using all kinds of painstakingly thought-out excuses that have no political, legal, or moral basis, the issue of restoring China's legitimate rights in the United Nations would undoubtedly have been resolved well long ago. The United States is unwilling to take into account the fact that nearly twenty-five countries have established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China or are in the process of establishing diplomatic relations.

We believe that such a policy that disregards the national interests of the people of Asian countries is doomed to failure, and those who are unwilling to face the advance of the wheel of history, both now and in the past, have repeatedly suffered this failure. The advance of the wheel of history has proved that the end of such a policy can only be failure. It is the responsibility of peace-loving people in all countries to eliminate the obstacles that hinder the People's Republic of China from obtaining legitimate status in the United Nations and participating in the work of this organization. The work of the United Nations cannot be successful until the People's Republic of China participates in the work of the United Nations equally with all other sovereign states. In view of the above, the Soviet delegation submits the following resolution requesting immediate adoption:

"The General Assembly considers it necessary for the representatives of the People's Republic of China appointed by the Central People's Government to obtain China's legitimate status in the General Assembly and other bodies of the United Nations Organization."

The Soviet delegation believes that it has a responsibility to urge the General Assembly to pay particular attention to the fact that further delay in resolving this issue will inevitably seriously damage the international prestige of the United Nations and the cause of security and peace throughout the world.

The Soviet delegation expresses the hope that the issue of restoring the legitimate rights of the Chinese people in the United Nations can be resolved well at the current session of the United Nations General Assembly without further delay. (Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, TASS)

    关于中华人民共和国在联合国中的代表权
    ——维辛斯基九月二十一日在联大全体会议上的发言
    请容许我代表苏联代表团向我们的临时主席致意，并感谢她对大会本届会议发表了热忱的演说。同时，请容许我代表苏联向出席联合国大会第九届会议的代表们致意，祝他们在解决大会议程上的重要问题的工作中获得成功。
    潘迪特夫人在这里十分恰当地指出，本届会议是在国际紧张局势有了一定程度的缓和的情况下开幕的。毫无疑问，这在很大程度上是由于柏林四国会议和日内瓦会议的召开。出席日内瓦会议的有美国、英国、法国、苏联和取得了合法的大国地位的中华人民共和国的外交部长，还有其他一些有关国家参加。
    我认为在大会着手进行它的组织上的工作之前，有必要对这个问题加以说明，特别侧重我在以后要叙述的情节。
    无可否认，日内瓦会议在缓和国际紧张局势方面迈进了一大步：历时近八年的血腥的印度支那战争已经停止下来，印度支那的和平已经恢复了。同时，日内瓦会议证实了伟大的中国人民在解决争执不下的国际问题上的重要作用。
    日内瓦会议证实苏联和其他若干国家所坚持的原则是正确的，这一原则就是：维持和平和国际安全的重大问题，没有中华人民共和国这个大国参加是不能解决的。
    中国参加日内瓦会议所作出的积极的贡献现在是举世公认了的。在苏联的支持下，中华人民共和国中央人民政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在结束朝鲜战争和签订停战协定方面表现的高贵的主动性也同样是众所周知的。今年六月，中华人民共和国政务院总理周恩来先生和印度总理尼赫鲁先生的会谈以及周恩来和缅甸总理吴努先生的会谈表明，这些最大的亚洲国家已经在它们共同努力来加强东南亚以及全世界的和平的问题上达到了谅解。
    大会本届会议面临着重要的任务，世界各国人民期待着这些任务的完成。我们的临时主席潘迪特夫人强调这一点是完全正确的。
      我们的宪章要求联合国按照正义的原则，按照国际法的原则履行它的义务，要求它促进国际间的友好关系并成为各国协同行动和达到共同目的的中心。
    联合国只有严格地遵守宪章的规定才能尽到它的职责，尽到它对全人类所负有的加强国际安全和巩固世界和平的职责——对于这一点我们没有丝毫疑问。
    但是，应该承认，大会中的多数经常违背这些要求。大家知道，中国人民所进行的民族解放斗争早在一九四九年就已在全国范围内取得了完全的、最后的胜利。这是一个伟大的具有历史意义的胜利，它从根本上改变了亚洲各国的形势。在过去五年中，中国走过了光荣的历史发展道路。中央人民政府领导中国人民奋发地努力建立新的生活，在这个新生活中人民的福利是真正的至高无上的法律。六亿中国人民在他们的人民政府的领导下，正在成功地建设新生活并对在友好合作的基础上加强国际关系、保卫和平和国际安全的事业作出他们的贡献。
    先生们，有六亿之多的伟大的中国人民在自称有责任加强各国人民间友谊联系的国际组织——联合国——中仍然没有代表，中国在联合国中的法定地位仍然由已被赶出这个国家的国民党集团的代表盘踞着，这种情况难道不是荒谬绝伦的吗？这种情况是联合国的耻辱。
    这种情况破坏它的国际威望，破坏人们对于联合国作为一个国际组织的尊重和信任。这种情况怎么样都是不能容忍的。这种情况有损一切爱好和平的人民的利益，并且剥夺了我们的组织——它称为联合国组织——对巩固世界和平和国际安全作出有价值的贡献的机会。没有中华人民共和国参加的情况，已对像安全理事会这种重要的机构的工作产生不良影响。根据联合国宪章，中国是安全理事会的常任理事国，但是，它在安全理事会中的席位却被一个既没有权利又不能代表任何人的代表非法盘踞着。我再说一遍，这种情况怎么样都是不能容忍的。联合国不能对全世界广泛的公众和政界人物的要求置之不顾。他们要求纠正这样一种明明白白的不公平的现象，要求纠正这样一种无法无天的现象：剥夺中华人民共和国出席联合国和出席联合国中像安全理事会这样的重要机构的合法权利。
    许多国家的一些著名政治家都主张恢复中国在联合国中的合法权利，这些国家中包括英国、印度、巴基斯坦、挪威、丹麦、冰岛和瑞典。
    这一切表明，全世界各国极广泛的公众人士都承认中国参加国际事务的重要性，并且认识到：当大国之一中华人民共和国被排斥在外的时候，联合国根本谈不上是一个权威性的国际组织。
    如果不是因为大国之一美国利用各种各样没有任何政治、法律或道义根据的、挖空心思想出来的借口进行阻挠的话，毫无疑问，恢复中国在联合国内的合法权利问题早已得到良好的解决。美国不愿意把这样一个事实考虑进去：将近二十五个国家已经同中华人民共和国建立外交关系或者正在建立外交关系的过程中。
    我们相信，这样一种不顾亚洲各国人民民族利益的政策是注定要失败的，那些现在和过去都不愿正视历史车轮的前进的人已经一再遭到了这种失败。历史车轮的前进已经证明这样一种政策的下场不能是别的，只能是失败。各国爱好和平人民有责任来消除阻碍中华人民共和国在联合国中取得合法地位并参加这个组织的工作的障碍，在中华人民共和国同所有其他主权国家平等地参加联合国的工作以前，联合国的工作是不能成功的。鉴于以上所述，苏联代表团提出以下决议要求立刻加以通过：
    “大会认为中央人民政府任命的中华人民共和国代表在大会及联合国组织的其他机构中取得中国的合法地位是必要的。”
    苏联代表团认为它有责任促请大会特别注意这样一个事实：在这个问题的解决上再事拖延，必然会严重损害联合国的国际威望以及全世界的安全和和平事业。
    苏联代表团表示希望恢复中国人民在联合国中的合法权利问题能在联合国大会本届会议上得到良好的解决而不再事拖延。（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科电）
