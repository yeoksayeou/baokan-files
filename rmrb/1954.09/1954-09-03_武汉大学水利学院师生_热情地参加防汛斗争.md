Wuhan University's Hydraulic Engineering College faculty and students enthusiastically participated in Wuhan's flood control efforts. Since the beginning of the flood season, Hydraulic Engineering College students have been working on the dikes in shifts, and some teachers have participated in the technical aspects of flood control. On the dikes, they provided technical guidance for dike defense, dike construction, and emergency dike protection, and also participated in emergency dike protection like everyone else. Eight professors, associate professors, and teaching assistants working in the Chief Engineer's Office of the Wuhan Flood Control Headquarters have been responsible for guiding dike heightening, thickening, constructing secondary dikes, and building cofferdams, as well as assisting with the city's flood control planning and design, and hydrological and soil research. They have made certain contributions to Wuhan's flood control in terms of technology. Among them, Associate Professor Feng Guodong has been awarded the title of second-class flood control hero. Students who have performed meritorious service include Lan Jumin and Luo Zhewen, among others.

During this Wuhan flood control effort, eight third-year students from the Hydraulic Engineering Construction Department of the Hydraulic Engineering College were strong assistants to the engineering personnel. In the early stages of flood control, the entire measurement of the Wuchang dike defense line, the blocking of the Wutai Gate, the gate outlets of each pier, and the waste water ditch near Tanhualin, as well as other projects, were all surveyed and designed by these students, and then they were responsible for the construction after being approved by the engineers. On the Jiangbian in Wuchang, in front of the joint state-private Han口 No. 1 Textile Company, the flood was only six centimeters away from entering the door, and a 250-meter-long waterproof dike had to be built here immediately. This waterproof dike was surveyed and designed by Chen Wenguo and Xiao Huanxiong, two third-year students from the Hydraulic Engineering Construction Department of the Hydraulic Engineering College, and then they guided the construction overnight. Later, as the water level rose, this waterproof wall was gradually heightened and reinforced. Now, it has withstood the test of the largest flood in the previous period.

The students who participated in the emergency rescue demonstrated a very brave spirit. Not long ago, a breach occurred in a dike in Hanyang, and Chen Yunlong, a second-year student from the Hydraulic Engineering Construction Department of the Hydraulic Engineering College, jumped into the water without hesitation to block and rescue the breach. When an accident occurred at the Ehang Pier in the fifth section of the third command post in Hankou, the engineer could not arrive in time, and Chen Yongqing, a student of the Hydraulic Engineering College's specialized course, led the emergency rescue project here, and worked with many rescue team members to prevent the further development of the dangerous situation. In order to rush to the rescue, he had not slept for five consecutive nights.

In this flood control effort, the faculty and students of the Hydraulic Engineering College gained a lot of practical experience in fighting floods and were tempered.

### 武汉大学水利学院师生  热情地参加防汛斗争

    武汉大学水利学院师生
    热情地参加防汛斗争
    武汉大学水利学院师生热情地参加了武汉市的防汛斗争。防汛以来，水利学院学生轮流在堤上工作，部分教师参加了防汛的技术工作。在堤上，他们作守堤、筑堤、护堤抢险的技术指导，也和大家
  一样参加护堤抢险。在武汉市防汛总指挥部总工程师室工作的八名教授、副教授和助教，防汛以来一直担任指导堤岸加高、培厚和做子堤、做围堰，协助全市的防汛规划设计和水文、土壤研究等工作。他们在技术方面对武汉市防汛都有一定的贡献。其中，副教授冯国栋已被评选为二等防汛功臣。学生立功的有蓝聚民、罗哲文等八人。
    这次武汉防汛中，水利学院水工建筑系三年级的八个学生是工程人员们强有力的助手。在防汛初期，整个武昌堤防确保线的测量，武泰闸、各码头闸口和昙华林附近废水沟的堵塞以及其他一些工程，都是由这几个学生勘察、设计，同时经工程师批准后分别由他们负责施工的。在武昌江边，公私合营汉口第一纺织公司门前，洪水曾经只差六公分高就快要进门了，须马上在这里造一道二百五十公尺长的防水堤。这个防水堤就是由水利学院水工建筑系三年级学生陈文国、萧焕雄两人勘测设计，然后又由他们两人连夜指导施工造成的。后来随着水位上涨，这个防水墙又逐渐加高加固。现在，它已经受过前些时期最大洪水的考验。
    参加抢险的学生们表现了非常勇敢的精神。不久以前，在汉阳的一处堤岸发生漏洞，水利学院水工建筑系二年级学生陈云龙毫不迟疑地跳入水中去堵塞抢救。汉口第三指挥部第五工段鄂航码头出险时，工程师一时赶不到，水利学院专修科的学生陈永清就领导这里的抢险工程，和许多抢险队员共同努力，制止了险情的继续发展。为了抢险，他曾经一连五个通宵没有睡觉。
    在这次防汛中，水利学院师生们取得了许多和洪水作战的实际斗争经验，并且受到了锻炼。
