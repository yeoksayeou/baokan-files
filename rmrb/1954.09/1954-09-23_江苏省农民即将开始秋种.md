    Jiangsu Province farmers will soon begin autumn planting.

    Jiangsu Province plans to sow over 33 million mu of wheat this autumn, an increase of over 500,000 mu compared to last year. Sowing will begin soon in the northern regions. In order to sow wheat in a timely manner, the Jiangsu Province People's Government has stockpiled 167 million jin of wheat seeds, which have been transferred to local grain departments and grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives to meet farmers' needs. These seeds have been tested multiple times by agricultural scientists, and their germination rate is generally very good. More than 4 million jin of pesticides to prevent underground pests have been shipped from Shanghai, Shenyang, and other places to Xuzhou, Huaiyin, Yancheng, and other special districts. These areas will carry out large-scale pest control using pesticides and machinery, which is expected to cover more than 10 million mu. The Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Jiangsu Province People's Government has transferred more than 400 agricultural technicians to various places to provide technical guidance on the prevention and control of underground pests and has printed 100,000 copies of popular publicity materials for distribution to rural areas. The Xuzhou and Huaiyin Administrative Offices have also dispatched cadres to the countryside to investigate the situation of underground pests. In Xuzhou and Huaiyin, about 30,000 trained farmer pest control experts are participating in the work of preventing and controlling underground pests. Under the leadership of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, farmers in various places are seizing the opportunity before wheat planting to accumulate fertilizer in large quantities. In areas where single-crop wheat fields and early autumn crops have already been harvested, farmers have quickly begun autumn plowing. Farmers in some low-lying areas are actively draining waterlogged areas, striving to plant wheat on every flooded piece of land. In the preparation for autumn planting, mutual aid and cooperation organizations in many areas have developed. The number of organized farming households participating in autumn planting throughout the province can reach 4 million. (Xinhua News Agency)

    江苏省农民即将开始秋种
    江苏省计划今年秋季播种小麦三千三百多万亩，比去年增加五十多万亩。现在北部地区即将开始播种。为了适时播种小麦，江苏省各级人民政府储备的一亿六千七百万斤小麦种籽，已调运到各地粮食部门和基层供销合作社，以供应农民需要。这些种籽都经过农业科学工作者多次检验，发芽情况一般很好。四百多万斤防治地下害虫的药粉，已从上海、沈阳等地运到徐州、淮阴、盐城等专区。这些地区进行大面积的药械防治地下害虫，预计达一千多万亩。江苏省人民政府农林厅已抽调农业技术工作人员四百多人，分赴各地进行防治地下害虫的技术指导，并印了十万份通俗宣传品，分发到各地农村。徐州、淮阴等专署也抽调干部下乡，调查地下害虫的情况。徐州、淮阴两专区并有经过训练的农民治虫能手约三万人，参加防治地下害虫的工作。各地农民在互助合作组织带动下，都抓紧种麦以前的空隙时机大量积肥。一熟麦田和早秋作物已经收获的地区，农民迅速开始了秋耕。部分低洼地区的农民积极排除积水，争取每一块受淹的土地都种小麦。在准备秋种中，许多地区的互助合作组织有了发展。全省投入秋种的有组织的农户可达到四百万户。（新华社）
