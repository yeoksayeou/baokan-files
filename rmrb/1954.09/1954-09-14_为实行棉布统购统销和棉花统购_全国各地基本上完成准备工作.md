Preparations Basically Completed Nationwide for Implementing Unified Purchase and Sale of Cotton Cloth and Unified Purchase of Cotton

The state's implementation of planned purchase and planned supply of cotton cloth, and planned purchase of cotton, under unified leadership and unified planning, has seen the basic completion of necessary preparations nationwide.

The planned purchase and planned supply of cotton cloth and the planned purchase of cotton are important policies of the state during the transition period, as well as extremely complex and arduous political tasks. Therefore, relevant departments at the central and local levels conducted preparatory work before implementation. In August, provinces and municipalities successively established special agencies to lead this work. In order to correctly determine the amount of cloth for residents, these leading agencies conducted investigations and studies on cotton cloth production and consumption, and formulated cotton cloth supply plans based on cotton cloth resources and the different purchasing power levels of urban and rural people in different regions. Purchase coupons for cloth have been printed in various places and are being successively transported to distribution units for timely distribution.

In terms of material preparation, as of the end of August, the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation controlled over 96 percent of the national machine-woven yarn and cloth output value. The China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation began allocating people's autumn and winter cloth to various regions as early as July. The supply of goods in various places is very sufficient. The cloth reserves of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation's Changchun City Company alone have doubled compared with the same period last year.

Local people's governments are making arrangements for private cotton cloth and cotton businesses across the country in accordance with policies. By the end of August, the vast majority of cotton cloth wholesalers in large cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, Guangzhou, and Wuhan had been carefully dealt with and appropriately arranged by the local people's governments. As for private cotton cloth retailers, the vast majority of them had established wholesale business relationships with the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation since the spring of this year. In the future, the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation will transform them into retail businesses of a state-capitalist nature through distribution or agency sales, and guide them to improve their business management and further serve consumers.

Relevant departments in the main cotton-producing areas, such as Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Henan provinces, have also carried out various preparations for the planned purchase of cotton. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    为实行棉布统购统销和棉花统购
    全国各地基本上完成准备工作
    国家对棉布实行计划收购，计划供应和对棉花实行计划收购，在统一领导和统一计划下，全国各地都已基本上完成了必要的准备工作。
    棉布计划收购、计划供应和棉花计划收购是国家在过渡时期的一项重要政策，也是极为复杂而艰巨的一项政治任务。因之，中央和各地有关部门在实施之前，都进行了准备工作。八月间，各省、直辖市又相继成立领导这一工作的专门机构。这些领导机构为了正确规定居民的用布量，对棉布生产和消费情况都进行了调查研究，并根据棉布的资源和不同地区城乡人民不同的购买力水平制定棉布供应计划。各地购布票都已印好，且陆续运到发放单位，以便及时发放。
    在物资准备方面，截至八月底止，中国花纱布公司掌握的机纱布货源已占全国机纱布产值的百分之九十六以上。目前人民秋冬用布，中国花纱布公司早在七月间就开始向各地调拨。各地货源都很充足，仅中国花纱布公司长春市公司储备的布就比去年同期增加一倍。
    对私营棉布和棉花商业，各地人民政府正在根据政策对他们进行全行业的安置。到八月底，上海、天津、北京、广州、武汉等大城市的棉布批发商绝大部分已由当地人民政府进行了慎重的处理与适当的安置。私营棉布零售商贩方面，其中绝大部分从今年春就和中国花纱布公司建立批购业务关系。今后中国花纱布公司将通过经销或代销的方式，把他们改造成为国家资本主义性质的零售商业，并指导他们改善经营管理，进一步为消费者服务。
    棉花计划收购，在主要产棉区河北、山东、江苏、河南等省的有关部门，亦已进行了各项准备工作。（据新华社讯）
