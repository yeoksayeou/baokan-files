    New Building of Beijing Hotel Completed to Receive Delegates to the National People's Congress
    A nine-story building, an expansion of the Beijing Hotel, has recently been completed. The first guests to be received in this tall and magnificent new building are the delegates from all over the country attending the National People's Congress.
    The new building of the Beijing Hotel has a construction area of 35,000 square meters. The building has more than 280 guest rooms, and each floor has a lounge. A large banquet hall that can accommodate more than 2,000 people is located on the first floor. It features red pillars and yellow walls, with exquisite and beautiful彩画 (cǎihuà) [painted decorations] with rich national style painted on the ceiling, and palace lanterns hanging in the corridors. There is also a large open-air dance floor on the top of the building.
    Construction workers launched a labor competition to welcome the convening of the National People's Congress. The workers said: The houses we are building are for the delegates to the National People's Congress and other distinguished guests to live in. This is our honor. We must build them quickly, build them well, and save money. Thanks to the efforts of the workers, the new building project was completed in only one year and two months. The construction area of the new building is half larger than the old Beijing Hotel building, but the old building took more than three years to complete. (Xinhua News Agency) (Attached photo)

    北京饭店新楼落成接待全国人民代表大会代表
    北京饭店扩建的一座九层大楼最近落成。这座高大而华丽的新大楼，首次接待的客人是从全国各地来北京参加全国人民代表大会会议的代表。
    北京饭店的新楼建筑面积达三万五千平方公尺。大楼共有客房二百八十多间，每层楼都有休息室。能容纳两千多人的大宴会厅设在第一层楼内。红柱黄墙，顶上绘着富有民族风格的精美彩画，走廊上挂着宫灯。在大楼顶上还有一个宽大的露天舞池。
    建筑工人们为了迎接全国人民代表大会会议的召开，曾展开了劳动竞赛。工人们说：我们盖的房子是给全国人民代表大会代表和其他贵宾们住的，这是我们的光荣，我们要盖得快、盖得好，还要节省。由于工人们的努力，新楼工程只化一年零两个月的时间就完成了。新楼的建筑面积比北京饭店旧大楼大一半，但旧楼却盖了三年多时间才完成。                           （新华社）（附图片）
