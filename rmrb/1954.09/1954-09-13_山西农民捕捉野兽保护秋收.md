Shanxi Province's mountain area peasants, in order to reduce grain losses and overfulfill agricultural production increase tasks, are actively capturing wild animals. Peasants in counties such as Zuoquan, Xiyang, Pingding, Hunyuan, and Fushan have organized themselves to actively capture wild animals. Kouze Township in Zuoquan County established a Production Increase and Autumn Protection Committee, based on agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid teams, organized night field patrol teams, divided the land into sections, patrolled by section, and organized mountain hitting teams to specifically capture and kill wild animals. The militia of Nan’si Township in Pingding County killed six badgers in two days and two nights. The mountain hitting team of Xichuan Township captured and killed twelve badgers, eight foxes, one hundred and eighty-four weasels, and twenty-five ground squirrels in twenty days.

    山西省山区农民为减少粮食损耗，超额完成农业增产任务，纷纷捕捉野兽。左权、昔阳、平定、浑源、浮山等县许多农民组织起来，积极捕捉野兽。左权口则乡成立了增产保秋委员会，以各农业社和互助组为主，组织了夜间巡田小组，划分地片，按片巡查，并组织了打山小组，专门捕打野兽。平定南寺乡民兵，两天两夜打死大獾六只，西川乡打山小组二十天捕打獾子十二只、狐八只、犵猁一百八十四只、地鼠二十五只。
