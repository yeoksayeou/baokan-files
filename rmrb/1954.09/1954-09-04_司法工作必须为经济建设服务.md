    Judicial work must serve economic construction
    The people's court is a powerful weapon of our country to punish criminals and educate the masses to abide by the law. During the period of national economic recovery in the past, the central task of the people's court was to actively cooperate with various social reform movements, cooperate with relevant state organs to severely suppress all kinds of counter-revolutionary elements, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and ensure the rapid recovery and development of the national economy. Now that the country has entered a period of large-scale economic construction, the central task of the people's court should be to use the people's democratic legal system to continue to severely suppress counter-revolutionary elements, punish all kinds of criminals who endanger and sabotage the country's socialist construction and socialist transformation, and ensure the smooth implementation of the general task of the state during the transition period from the perspective of judicial work.
    In order to make the work of the court closely serve the overall task of the state, the people's courts of provinces and municipalities and the people's courts of cities under the jurisdiction of provinces with a large number of industrial and mining enterprises should strengthen the trial work of cases involving sabotaging national economic construction, and gradually establish specialized courts with a focus on important railway and water transportation lines to specifically try criminal cases involving sabotage and endangering railway and water transportation undertakings.
    The people's courts in many places attach great importance to strengthening the trial work of cases involving sabotaging national economic construction. After the Second National Judicial Conference held in April 1953, many provincial and municipal people's courts took the initiative to contact relevant departments, and seized the time to handle more than 90,000 cases related to sabotaging economic construction and endangering worker safety last year. Some local people's courts have also begun to focus on going deep into industrial and mining enterprises, transportation departments, and basic construction sites to investigate and study the situation in a planned manner, and establish trial operations there. According to incomplete statistics from the Central Ministry of Justice, eight railway specialized courts and one waterway specialized court have been established nationwide. Generally, many provincial and municipal courts and specialized courts take the initiative to cooperate with the central work of industrial and mining enterprises and transportation departments, and have handled a number of counter-revolutionary sabotage cases, corruption and theft cases, and responsibility accident cases in which national property suffered major losses due to passive怠工 (go-slow work) and dereliction of duty. These have played a positive role in protecting and promoting production and construction, preventing crime, reducing accidents, and consolidating labor discipline.
    However, today there are still some adjudicators who, although verbally admitting that trial work should serve the country's economic construction, have not really studied how to cooperate with and strengthen the trial work of cases involving sabotaging the country's economic construction, using the excuse of "too many cases and too few cadres"; there are also some adjudicators who have realized the importance of trial work serving the country's economic construction, but feel that economic construction problems are too complicated, they do not understand technology, and do not know how to start; some who go deep into factories find it difficult to find a way in, and do not grasp the main problems.
    These difficulties do exist. The courts do have few people and many things; economic construction, especially industrial construction, is indeed a very complicated work, and if the adjudicators do not have certain production and construction knowledge, it will be difficult for them to correctly handle cases involving economic issues. However, the solution to these difficult problems should not be to passively wait for higher-level organs to transfer cadres, nor should it be to wait until they have learned production and construction knowledge before handling the trial work of cases involving sabotaging economic construction, but should be to actively and focus on going deep into industrial and mining enterprises and transportation departments, while establishing trial operations, while learning in practical work, and cultivating cadres in practical work, to create favorable conditions for gradually establishing and developing trial operations in industrial and mining enterprises and transportation departments. It is not to say that adjudicators must become specialists in technical knowledge in order to conduct trial work. According to the experience of Anshan and other places, as long as the adjudicators have a general understanding of the production process, labor organization, and enterprise management system of industrial and mining enterprises, and can humbly learn from jurors, technical appraisers, and the masses of workers during the trial process, the technical problems involved in the case can be solved; and to master general production and construction knowledge, that is something that general adjudicators can do.
    The people's courts of general prefectures and counties must strengthen the resolute struggle against criminal acts that undermine agricultural production and mutual assistance and cooperation, and violate national grain policies and decrees on the unified purchase and sale of important materials. At present, some adjudicators of county people's courts have a one-sided view of safeguarding economic construction. They believe that only industrial construction is economic construction, and agricultural production does not seem to be very important, so they are not at ease with their work. These comrades obviously do not understand the significant role of agriculture in the national economy. They do not even understand that steadily and actively developing the mutual assistance and cooperation movement, transforming the scattered and backward small-scale peasant economy into an advanced collective cooperative economy, and continuously improving the level of agricultural production are extremely important aspects of realizing the general task of the state during the transition period. Therefore, safeguarding agricultural production and the mutual assistance and cooperation movement from the perspective of trial work should also be one of the main tasks of the people's court.
    Many adjudicators, because they do not clearly recognize that trial work must serve the overall task of the state, still hold a blind and unplanned idea of handling cases as they come, so they do not actively and proactively try cases related to sabotaging economic construction. This phenomenon must be quickly corrected.
    In addition to further strengthening the trial work of cases involving sabotaging and endangering the country's economic construction, people's courts at all levels must also regularly summarize trial experience, and continuously improve and enhance trial work, so that all adjudicators can realize that the role of people's trial work is not only to passively punish crimes, but more importantly, to actively prevent and reduce crimes through various activities of the court. One of the main methods to achieve this goal is to regularly summarize trial experience. This can not only promptly discover and correct deviations and errors in the implementation of policies and regulations in trial work, but also more comprehensively and systematically understand the situation of crimes, the causes of their occurrence, and their laws. Through summarizing trial experience, the people's court can clearly recognize the main tasks of trial work in each period, concentrate its main efforts to first strike at criminal acts that cause greater harm, and overcome the ideological style of blindly handling cases.
    At the same time, and more importantly: after the experience of trial work is summarized, we can more effectively educate cadres and the masses, continuously improve their political and ideological awareness and legal awareness, and mobilize the strength of all aspects of society to prevent and reduce crime. Through the summary of theft cases in factories, the Anshan City People's Court found that the harm of this criminal behavior was extremely serious, not only causing major losses to state property, but also affecting the workers' production morale. Some workers delayed production due to theft prevention, and some workers even asked to be transferred from the factory. The reason why this criminal behavior occurs from time to time is mainly because the organization of some factories is impure, and habitual thieves have been mixed in, especially because the work system of the factory or workshop is unsound, ideological work is weak, and administrative management is lax. In response to these situations, the Anshan City People's Court dealt with a group of habitual thieves in a big way, and summarized the causes of these cases, thereby profoundly educating the workers and masses, and urging relevant factories and enterprises to improve their work, and actively prevent and reduce the occurrence of this criminal behavior. This example illustrates the importance of summarizing trial experience. Therefore, the responsible comrades of people's courts at all levels should attach great importance to this work, personally lead and urge cadres to do this work well.
    People's courts at all levels should also conscientiously implement the mass line of judicial work, continue to mobilize and organize the masses to participate in and supervise judicial trial activities, gradually establish and improve the people's jury system, effectively strengthen and rectify the people's mediation committees, and do a good job in the work of the people's reception room. Cadres of people's courts at all levels must establish the idea of judicial work serving the country's economic construction, strive to study their work, improve themselves, and truly improve the court's trial work, and better serve the country's socialist economic construction.

### 司法工作必须为经济建设服务

    司法工作必须为经济建设服务
    人民法院是我们国家用以惩罚犯罪、教育群众守法的一个有力武器。在过去国民经济的恢复时期，人民法院的中心任务是积极配合各项社会改革运动，配合有关国家机关严厉镇压各种反革命分子，巩固人民民主专政，保障国民经济的迅速恢复和发展。在国家已进入大规模的经济建设时期，人民法院的中心任务，就应该是运用人民民主的法制，继续严厉镇压反革命分子，惩治各种危害和破坏国家社会主义建设和社会主义改造的犯罪分子，从审判工作方面保障国家过渡时期总任务的顺利实施。
    为了使法院工作密切为国家总任务服务，在省、市人民法院和工矿企业较多的省辖市人民法院方面，应该加强对于破坏国家经济建设案件的审判工作，并在重要的铁路、水运沿线有重点地逐步建立专门法院，专门审判关于破坏和危害铁路、水上运输事业的犯罪案件。
    许多地方的人民法院都很重视加强破坏国家经济建设案件的审判工作。一九五三年四月召开的第二届全国司法会议以后，已有不少省、市人民法院主动地与有关部门取得联系，在去年一年内抓紧处理了有关破坏经济建设和危害工人安全的案件九万多件。还有一些地方的人民法院开始有重点地深入工矿企业、交通运输部门和基本建设工地，有计划地调查研究情况，在那里建立审判业务。根据中央司法部的不完全统计，全国现已建立了八个铁路专门法院，一个水运专门法院。许多省、市法院和专门法院，一般都主动配合工矿企业和交通运输部门的中心工作，处理了一批反革命破坏案件、贪污盗窃案件、因消极怠工和玩忽职守致使国家财产遭受重大损失的责任事故案件。这些对于保护和推动生产建设、预防犯罪、减少事故和巩固劳动纪律等方面起了积极的作用。
    但是，今天还有一些审判人员虽然口头上承认审判工作应该为国家经济建设服务，实际上却以“案件多，干部少”为借口，一直没有很好地研究如何配合和加强对破坏国家经济建设案件的审判工作；还有一些审判人员虽然已经认识到审判工作为国家经济建设服务的重要性，但是觉得经济建设问题太复杂，自己不懂技术，不知怎样下手；有的深入工厂后苦于找不到门径，没有抓住主要问题。
    这些困难的确是存在的。法院现在的确是人少事多；经济建设特别是工业建设，确实是很复杂的工作，审判人员不具备一定的生产建设知识，就难以正确地处理有关经济问题的案件。但是解决这些困难问题的办法，不应该是消极地等待上级机关增调干部，也不应该是等待学会了生产建设知识，然后才去处理关于破坏经济建设案件的审判工作，而是应该积极地有重点地深入工矿企业和交通运输部门，一面建立审判业务，一面在实际工作中学习，在实际工作中培养干部，为逐步在工矿企业和交通运输部门中建立和开展审判业务创造有利条件。审判人员必须懂得一定的生产建设知识，这并不是说他们必须成为技术知识的专门家，才能进行审判工作。根据鞍山等地的经验，审判人员只要对工矿企业的生产过程、劳动组织和企业管理制度等方面有一般的了解，而又能在审判过程中虚心向陪审员、技术鉴定人和职工群众学习，案件涉及的技术问题就能够得到解决；而要掌握一般的生产建设知识，那是一般的审判人员都能办到的。
    一般的专区和县的人民法院，必须加强对破坏农业生产和互助合作、违反国家粮食政策及重要物资统购统销法令的犯罪行为，展开坚决的斗争。目前有部分的县人民法院的审判人员，对于保卫经济建设有一种片面的看法，他们认为只有工业建设才是经济建设，农业生产似乎就不很重要，因此不安心于自己的工作。这些同志显然是不了解农业在国民经济中的重大作用。更不了解稳步而积极地开展互助合作运动，把分散落后的小农经济转变为先进的集体的合作经济，不断地提高农业生产的水平，这是实现国家过渡时期总任务的一个极其重要的方面。因此，从审判工作方面保卫农业生产和互助合作运动，也应该是人民法院的主要任务之一。
    不少审判人员，由于没有明确认识审判工作必须为国家总任务服务，还抱着一种盲目的无计划的就案办案的思想，因而他们不积极主动地审判有关破坏经济建设的案件。这种现象，必须迅速加以纠正。
    各级人民法院除了应该进一步加强对破坏和危害国家经济建设案件的审判工作以外，还必须经常地总结审判经验，不断地改进和提高审判工作，要使所有的审判人员都认识到，人民审判工作的作用不仅在于消极地惩罚犯罪，而且更为重要的是要通过法院的各种活动，积极地预防犯罪和减少犯罪。而要达到这一目的的主要方法之一，就是要经常总结审判经验。这就不但能够及时发现和纠正审判工作在贯彻执行政策法令中的偏差和错误，而且能够较为全面和系统地了解犯罪的情况、发生的原因和它的规律。经过总结审判经验，可以使人民法院能够明确认识每一个时期审判工作的主要任务，集中主要力量首先打击危害较大的犯罪行为，并克服盲目办案的思想作风。
    同时，更为重要的是：审判工作经验总结出来以后，我们就可以更有效地教育干部和群众，不断地提高他们的政治思想觉悟和守法观念，动员社会各方面的力量去预防犯罪和减少犯罪。鞍山市人民法院通过对于工厂中盗窃案件的总结，发现这种犯罪行为的危害性极为严重，不但使国家财产遭受重大损失，而且影响了工人的生产情绪，有的工人因防盗而耽误生产，有的工人甚至要求调厂。而这种犯罪行为所以时有发生，主要是因为部分工厂的组织不纯，混进了惯窃分子，特别是工厂或车间的工作制度不健全、思想工作薄弱和行政管理松懈。针对这些情况，鞍山市人民法院大张旗鼓地处理了一批惯窃罪犯，并对这些案件发生的原因作出了总结，从而深刻地教育了职工群众，促使有关的工厂企业改进了工作，从积极方面预防和减少了这种犯罪行为的发生。这一事例说明了总结审判经验的重要性。因此各级人民法院的负责同志应该十分重视这一工作，亲自领导和督促干部把这一工作作好。
    各级人民法院还应该认真地贯彻司法工作的群众路线，继续动员和组织群众参加和监督司法审判活动，逐步建立和健全人民陪审制，切实加强和整顿人民调解委员会，搞好人民接待室的工作。各级人民法院干部必须树立司法工作为国家经济建设服务的思想，努力钻研业务，提高自己，真正把法院审判工作提高一步，更好地为国家的社会主义经济建设服务。
