    The First Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, representing the will of our country's 600 million people, solemnly adopted the Constitution of the People's Republic of China on September 20, 1954. This Constitution is the product of the Chinese people's victorious revolutionary struggle over the past hundred years and the product of the new victories and new developments of the Chinese people since the founding of the nation in 1949. This Constitution defines the social and economic system and the political system of our country during the transition period, guaranteeing that our socialist construction will certainly achieve complete victory.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said in his opening speech at the First Session of the First National People's Congress: "This meeting is a milestone marking the new victories and new developments of our people since the founding of the country in 1949. The Constitution formulated at this meeting will greatly promote the socialist cause of our country." With this Constitution, the Chinese people have a powerful weapon and will be more confident in striving to build a socialist society, and will promote the socialist cause of our country on a larger scale.
    The Chinese people have longed for such a Constitution, and today they finally have it. Such a Constitution could not have been produced when our country was first founded, but only today, five years after the founding of the nation. According to the law of Chinese social and historical development, the Communist Party of China has long pointed out that the inevitable path of the Chinese revolution is from new democracy to socialism. This Constitution is the concrete symbol of this path.
    The Common Program played the role of a temporary constitution in the past five years, but the goal of building a socialist society was not stipulated in the Common Program. Five years ago, when the Common Program was formulated by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the People's Republic of China had just been founded, the people's revolutionary war was still continuing on a large area of ​​the country, the reform of the land system had not yet been carried out in the vast newly liberated areas, the revolutionary social order had not been completely consolidated, the national economy destroyed by the war had not been restored, and the state-owned economy, namely the socialist economy, was not strong, and its leading position and leading role had not been consolidated and developed. At that time, from the stage of historical development of our country, it had already entered the stage of socialist revolution, namely socialist transformation, from the stage of new democracy, namely the people's democratic revolution. However, at that time, many of the tasks of our people's democratic revolution had not yet been completed. We still had to resolve the contradiction between feudalism and democracy, namely between landlords and peasants, in the vast rural areas, and could not start to resolve the contradiction between capitalism and socialism; at that time, we also had to carry out democratic reforms in cities and industrial and commercial enterprises. The people's understanding and awareness of socialism were still very insufficient, and our experience in leading the country's construction was still very lacking. Therefore, the Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference did not explicitly stipulate the goal of building socialism, which was in line with the historical situation at that time.
    Today, the People's Republic of China has been established for five years, the remaining counter-revolutionary forces on the mainland of our country have been eliminated, the reform of the land system has been basically completed, the revolutionary social order has been consolidated, the national economy has been restored and developed, and a strong state-owned economy, namely the socialist economy, has been established, and has established its leading position in the entire national economy. Under the leadership of the state-owned economy, the individual agricultural and handicraft economy has gradually embarked on the road of cooperation, and capitalist industry and commerce have gradually embarked on the road of state capitalism. Cooperative economy and state capitalist economy have both had considerable development. That is to say, in the past few years, our country has actually begun to gradually carry out socialist transformation and has begun to gradually change the face of the social economy in the direction of socialism. Through several years of personal experience, the broad masses of the people have gradually realized the superiority of socialism and greatly improved their awareness. They are no longer satisfied with the benefits brought to them by land reform and general democratic reforms, but demand a large-scale socialist economy to create a happy life like that of the Soviet people for them, and demand the gradual establishment of a socialist society without class exploitation. The goal of socialism has become the goal recognized and pursued by the people of our country and has become the common wish of the people of our country. The bourgeoisie, which still exists in the transition period, also recognizes that socialism is the general trend due to the established leading position of the working class and the state-owned economy; and because they have made many progress and changes in their thinking and life, they have also been able to accept the policy of socialist transformation. Under this new social situation and the new social demands arising therefrom, it is entirely necessary for the Constitution of the People's Republic of China to explicitly stipulate the great goal of building a socialist society in our country.
    The Constitution of the People's Republic of China completely meets the needs of the development of our country's national life; it has been fully proved in the nationwide discussion of the draft constitution that it is supported by the vast number of people across the country. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his report on the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China at the National People's Congress: "Since this Constitution expresses the personal experience and long-term aspirations of the people, it will certainly play a huge positive role in our country's national life, and will certainly inspire the people to fight to defend and develop our victorious achievements, to smash all enemies who attempt to undermine our social system and national system, and to promote the sound development of our country's construction and accelerate the progress of our country's construction."
    The Constitution of the People's Republic of China has fixed the specific steps for realizing the general task of the state in the transition period in legal form, which has set our country on the track to socialism. The Constitution of the People's Republic of China stipulates the basic political system of our country, which is the people's congress system, which is both conducive to promoting the socialist enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity of the people and conducive to the state's implementation of highly unified and centralized leadership to overcome all obstacles on the socialist road. This political system of our country will powerfully guarantee our country's smooth transition from new democracy to socialism. Our Constitution declares that "all power in the People's Republic of China belongs to the people," and clearly stipulates that the purpose of the development and transformation of the national economy and the improvement of productivity in our country is to "improve the people's material and cultural life and consolidate the independence and security of the country." The provisions of the Constitution regarding the basic rights and obligations of citizens fully demonstrate the status of the people as masters of the country. There is no doubt that fixing all these facts in the form of the fundamental law of the state, such as the Constitution, will certainly further and continuously improve the enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people to fight for building a socialist society.
    Marxism-Leninism teaches us that the superstructure of society is produced by the economic base; but after it is produced, it will in turn serve its economic base and promote the development of this base. The national constitution is an important superstructure, which will actively protect and develop the already established economic base. Therefore, there is no doubt that our country's Constitution will become the most powerful weapon for the people of our country to fight for building socialism and to fight for creating their own happy life in the future.
    In order to realize the great goal of building socialism, the people of our country should correctly grasp and fully utilize the powerful weapon of the Constitution, and strive to abide by and safeguard the Constitution, just as they protect their own lives, property, and happy future. Every citizen should examine their own thoughts and behaviors in accordance with the Constitution, correctly exercise the civil rights stipulated in the Constitution, actively participate in the management and construction of the country, and make serious criticisms of the shortcomings and errors of state organs and state organ staff, and put forward positive suggestions on everything that should be promoted and reformed. At the same time, everyone should consciously and strictly abide by and fulfill the various civil obligations stipulated in the Constitution. Actively fulfilling obligations is the guarantee for fully enjoying vested rights and continuously expanding these rights, and it is also the guarantee for building a socialist society and enabling oneself to enjoy greater happiness. The rights and obligations of citizens stipulated in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China are unified and inseparable. Obligations without rights are unimaginable; similarly, rights without fulfilling obligations are also unimaginable. The rights of citizens are certainly what everyone is willing to enjoy, and the obligations of citizens are also the responsibilities that every citizen who treats the country with a master's attitude is happy to fulfill. If someone hopes to only enjoy rights without fulfilling obligations, or to fulfill fewer obligations and enjoy more rights, then he is not a good citizen. Those selfish and self-interested thoughts and behaviors that harm others and benefit oneself are the despicable and inferior roots of the exploiting classes, and we must overcome them through education and self-education, namely criticism and self-criticism.
    In order to realize the great goal of building socialism, the people of our country should also use the powerful weapon of the Constitution to fight against the destructive activities of all counter-revolutionary elements, to fight against the behavior of using private property to undermine the state's economic order and obstruct socialist transformation, and to fight against all criminal behaviors. Our country's Constitution does not tolerate any counter-revolutionary destruction or any criminal behavior. All state organs and every citizen should actively safeguard the interests of the country and the people in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and other laws. Expose and punish all kinds of counter-revolutionary destructive behaviors and criminal behaviors.
    In order to enable this Constitution to be familiar, observed, and grasped by all the people, we must, on the basis of the nationwide discussion of the draft constitution in the past, regard systematic and regular education on the Constitution as an important part of civic education in the future, so that the various provisions of the Constitution can penetrate the hearts of the people and be known to every household. All state organs and all the people must conscientiously abide by the various provisions of the Constitution, and use our hard work to make our country's Constitution show unparalleled great power in all aspects of national life and promote the great cause of socialist construction in our country to move forward continuously.

### 中华人民共和国宪法——中国人民建设社会主义社会的有力武器

    中华人民共和国宪法——中国人民建设社会主义社会的有力武器
    中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，代表着我国六万万人民的意志，于一九五四年九月二十日，庄严地通过了中华人民共和国宪法。这个宪法是中国人民一百多年来革命斗争胜利的产物，是中国人民从一九四九年建国以来的新胜利和新发展的产物。这个宪法确定了我国过渡时期的社会经济制度和政治制度，保证了我国的社会主义建设一定能够达到完全的胜利。
    毛泽东同志在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的开幕词中说：“这次会议是标志着我国人民从一九四九年建国以来的新胜利和新发展的里程碑。这次会议所制定的宪法将大大地促进我国的社会主义事业。”有了这个宪法，我国人民就有了一个有力的武器，将更加充满信心地为建设社会主义社会而奋斗，将要以更大的规模去推进我国的社会主义事业。
    中国人民渴望要有这样的宪法，今天终于有了。这样的宪法在我们的国家刚刚成立的时候不可能产生，只有在建国五年的今天才能够产生。按照中国社会历史发展的规律，中国共产党早已指出经过新民主主义到社会主义是中国革命的必然的道路。这个宪法就是这条道路的具体标志。
    共同纲领在过去五年间起了临时宪法的作用，但是在共同纲领中还没有把建设社会主义社会这一个目标规定下来。五年以前，由中国人民政治协商会议制定共同纲领的时候，中华人民共和国刚刚成立，人民革命战争还在大片的国土上继续进行，土地制度的改革在广大的新解放区还没有进行，革命的社会秩序还没有完全巩固，为战争所破坏的国民经济还没有恢复，国营经济即社会主义经济还不强大，它的领导地位和领导作用还没有巩固和发展起来。那时候，从我国历史发展的阶段上说，已经由新民主主义即人民民主主义革命的阶段进入了社会主义革命即社会主义改造的阶段。但是，当时我国人民民主革命的任务还有许多没有完成，我们还必须在广大的农村中解决封建主义和民主主义即地主和农民之间的矛盾，还不能着手解决资本主义和社会主义的矛盾；当时我们也还必须在城市和工商企业中进行民主改革，广大人民对于社会主义的认识和觉悟程度还很不够，我们领导国家建设事业的经验也还十分缺乏。因此，人民政治协商会议的共同纲领没有把建设社会主义这个目标用明文规定下来，这是符合于当时的历史情况的。
    今天，中华人民共和国已经成立五年了，我国大陆上的反革命残余势力已经肃清，土地制度的改革已经基本完成，革命的社会秩序已经巩固起来，国民经济已经恢复和发展了，强大的国营经济即社会主义经济已经建立起来，并且确立了自己在整个国民经济中的领导地位。在国营经济领导下，个体的农业和手工业经济已经逐步走上合作化的道路，资本主义工商业已经逐步走上国家资本主义的道路，合作社经济和国家资本主义经济都已经有了相当的发展。这就是说，我们的国家在过去几年中，已经在实际上开始逐步地进行了社会主义的改造，开始逐步地按照社会主义的方向改变了社会经济的面貌。广大的人民群众通过几年来的切身经验，逐渐认识了社会主义的优越性，大大提高了觉悟程度，他们已经不再满足于土地改革和一般民主改革所带给他们的利益，而要求以大规模的社会主义经济来为他们创造像苏联人民那样的幸福生活，要求逐步建立没有阶级剥削的社会主义社会。社会主义的目标已经成为我国人民所公认和努力追求的目标，已经成为我国人民的共同愿望了。过渡时期中仍然存在的资产阶级，也因为工人阶级和国营经济的领导地位的确立，承认社会主义是大势所趋；并且由于在思想上和生活上有了许多进步和改变，他们也已经能够接受社会主义改造的方针。在这种新的社会情况和由此所产生的新的社会要求之下，中华人民共和国宪法现在用明文规定在我国建设社会主义社会的伟大目标就是完全必要的了。
    中华人民共和国宪法完全切合我国的国家生活发展的需要；在宪法草案的全民讨论中已经充分证明，它是为全国广大人民所拥护的。刘少奇同志在全国人民代表大会会议上所作的关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告中说：“这个宪法既然是表达了人民群众的亲身经验和长期心愿，它就一定能够在我国的国家生活中起巨大的积极的作用，一定会鼓舞人民群众为保卫和发展我们的胜利成果而斗争，为粉碎一切企图破坏我国社会制度和国家制度的敌人而斗争，为促进我国建设事业的健全发展和加速我国建设的进度而斗争。”
    中华人民共和国宪法把实现国家在过渡时期总任务的具体步骤用法律形式固定了下来，这就为我们国家摆好了走到社会主义社会的前进轨道。中华人民共和国宪法规定了我们国家的基本政治制度，这就是既便利于发扬人民群众的社会主义热情和积极性创造性，又便利于国家实行高度统一和集中领导来克服社会主义道路上一切障碍的人民代表大会制度。我们国家的这种政治制度将有力地保证我国顺利地从新民主主义过渡到社会主义。我们的宪法宣布“中华人民共和国的一切权力属于人民”，并且明确地规定，在我们国家里国民经济的发展和改造，生产力的提高，目的都是“改进人民的物质生活和文化生活，巩固国家的独立和安全”。宪法中关于公民的基本权利和义务的规定充分表明了人民在国家中的主人地位。我们用宪法这样的国家根本法的形式把这一切事实固定了下来，毫无疑问，这就一定能够进一步地不断地提高广大人民为建成社会主义社会而斗争的积极性。
    马克思列宁主义教导我们：社会的上层建筑是由经济基础所产生；但它在产生以后，就会反过来为自己的经济基础服务，推动这一基础向前发展。国家的宪法是一种重要的上层建筑，它将积极保护和发展已经建立了的经济基础。因此，我国的宪法今后将成为我国人民为建设社会主义而斗争、为创造自己的幸福生活而斗争的最有力的武器，这也是毫无疑问的。
    为了实现伟大的建设社会主义的目标，我国人民应该正确地掌握和充分地运用宪法这个有力的武器，努力遵守和维护宪法，如同保护自己的生命财产和幸福前途一样。每一个公民都应该按照宪法来检查自己的思想行为，正确地行使宪法所规定的公民权利，积极参加国家的管理和建设工作，对国家机关和国家机关工作人员的缺点和错误进行严肃的批评，对一切应兴应革的事情提出积极的建议。同时，人人都应该自觉地严格遵守和履行宪法所规定的各项公民义务。积极履行义务，就是充分享受既得权利和不断地扩充这些权利的保证，也是建成社会主义社会、使自己享受更大幸福的保证。中华人民共和国宪法规定的公民的权利和义务是统一不可分的。没有权利的义务是不可想像的；同样，不尽义务的权利也是不可想像的。公民的权利固然是人人都愿意享受的，而公民的义务也是每一个以主人的态度对待国家的公民所乐尽的责任。如果有人希望只享权利而不尽义务，或者少尽义务而多享权利，那末，他就不是好的公民。那些自私自利、损人利己的思想行为是剥削阶级的可鄙的劣根性，我们必须用教育和自我教育即批评和自我批评的方法去克服它。
    为了实现伟大的建设社会主义的目标，我国人民还应该运用宪法这个有力的武器去和一切反革命分子的破坏活动作斗争，和利用私有财产来破坏国家经济秩序、阻挠社会主义改造的行为作斗争，和一切犯罪行为作斗争。我国的宪法丝毫不容许一切反革命的破坏和一切犯罪的行为。一切国家机关和每一个公民都应该按照宪法和其他法律的规定，积极保卫国家和人民的利益。检举和惩治各式各样的反革命的破坏行为和犯罪行为。
    为了使这个宪法能够为全体人民所熟悉、遵守和掌握，我们必须在过去全民讨论宪法草案的基础上，把系统的经常的关于宪法的教育，当作今后的公民教育的一个重要内容，使宪法的各项规定深入人心，家喻户晓。一切国家机关和全体人民一定要切实遵守宪法中的各项规定，用我们的努力工作，来使我国的宪法在国家生活的各方面，显示出无可比拟的巨大力量，推动我国社会主义的伟大建设事业不断前进。
