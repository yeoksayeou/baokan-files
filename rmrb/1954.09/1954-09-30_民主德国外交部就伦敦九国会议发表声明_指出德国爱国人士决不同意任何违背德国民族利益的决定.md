(Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 28th) According to a report by the German News Agency as reported by TASS from Berlin on September 26th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic issued a statement on the Nine-Nation Conference held in London on September 28th.

The statement first pointed out that West German Chancellor Adenauer intends to continue to implement the "European Defense Community" policy at the Nine-Nation Conference, which violates the German people's national aspiration for the reunification of Germany on the basis of peace and democracy. The revival of militarism in West Germany and its participation in aggressive military alliances will create insurmountable obstacles to the reunification of Germany. The Brussels Treaty, the North Atlantic Treaty, or other plans to revive the revanchist "Wehrmacht" by having West Germany participate in the US military pact, are all against the national interests of the German people. Therefore, Adenauer is neither qualified nor entitled to make statements on Germany or West Germany in the London Conference in the name of the German people.

The statement condemned Adenauer for attempting to abandon the German people's right to self-determination and sell out the German people's most fundamental national interests to the United States in order to achieve the arming of West Germany. The statement expressed that German patriots will never agree that the Western occupying countries have the right to continue occupying West Germany indefinitely and have the right to decide on the major national issue of the German people—the reunification of Germany.

The statement pointed out that the government of the German Democratic Republic has repeatedly proposed suggestions for seeking the rapprochement and reunification of the two parts of Germany. As long as both sides have the desire to reach mutual understanding, it is possible to reach a consensus on all issues that are most important to the German people.

The statement finally pointed out that the resumption of negotiations by the Four Powers on the German question is of particular importance to the German people. The statement called on all German patriots to unite and strive for a peaceful resolution of the German question.

    民主德国外交部就伦敦九国会议发表声明
    指出德国爱国人士决不同意任何违背德国民族利益的决定
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十六日讯：德意志通讯社报道，德意志民主共和国外交部就九月二十八日在伦敦举行的九国会议发表声明。
    声明首先指出：西德总理阿登纳打算在九国会议上继续执行“欧洲防务集团”政策，这个政策是违背德国人民要求在和平、民主的基础上统一德国的民族愿望的。在西德复活军国主义以及让西德参加侵略性的军事同盟会为德国的统一造成不可克服的障碍。布鲁塞尔公约、北大西洋公约或是其他通过使西德参加美国的军事公约来复活复仇主义的“国防军”的计划，都是违背德国人民的民族利益的。因此，阿登纳没有资格也没有权利以德国人的名义在伦敦会议上发表有关德国或西德的声明。
    声明谴责阿登纳为了实现武装西德，想放弃德国人民自决的权利，把德国人民最根本的民族利益出卖给美国。声明表示，德国爱国人士决不能同意西方占领国家有权无限期地继续占领西德和有权决定德国人民的重大民族问题——德国统一的问题。
    声明指出：德意志民主共和国政府曾再三提出谋求德国两部分接近和重新统一的建议，只要双方有取得互相谅解的愿望，在对德国人民最重要的一切问题上求得一致的观点是可能的。
    声明最后指出，四大国就德国问题恢复谈判对德国人民有着特别重要的意义。声明号召全德国的爱国者团结一致，争取和平解决德国问题。
