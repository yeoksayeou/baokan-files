    Strive to Increase Exports of Native and Specialty Products
    Qin Weiping
    To realize China's socialist industrialization, in addition to actively improving the existing production level, we must also continuously expand the production base, increase new factories and mines, and equip them with first-class machinery and equipment. Because China's current production and technical level are not yet high, a large part of the machinery and building materials we need still relies on imports from abroad; and native and specialty products account for a considerable proportion of China's current export goods. In 1952, the native and specialty products exported by the National Native Produce Export Corporation to fraternal countries, if converted into steel rails, could build 1.14 railways from Guangzhou to Manchuria. The native and specialty products exported in 1953 could be exchanged for more than 20 thermal power plants with a capacity of 25,000 kilowatts each, which could supply electricity for the daily life of more than 20 cities with a population of 800,000 to 1.2 million. This shows that expanding the export of native and specialty products is of particular importance to supporting the country's socialist industrialization.
    Since the nationwide liberation, under the leadership and support of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, China's production of native and specialty products has greatly developed. For example, the production of fruits, pork, eggs, various mountain products, and wool has exceeded the pre-war production level, strongly supporting the country's export trade. The expansion of this trade not only supports the needs of national economic construction, but also brings great benefits to farmers, herdsmen, and handicraft workers. China's native and specialty products account for about 30 percent of farmers' total income, and are one of the important sources of income for farmers, herdsmen, and handicraft producers. In the three years from 1950 to 1952, the state purchased hides, wool, camel hair, feathers, bristles, casings, etc. from farmers and herdsmen worth more than 520 billion yuan, equivalent to the annual income of 6 million farmers. In 1953, state-owned companies purchased eggs and egg products worth 477.4 billion yuan, and apples, tangerines, pomelos, and bananas worth 204.5 billion yuan. This does not include the purchases by local state-owned companies and cooperatives. Obviously, this plays a certain role in increasing the income of farmers and herdsmen, improving their lives, promoting the development of agriculture and animal husbandry, and promoting the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.
    The main feature of China's foreign trade is, first of all, the development of trade relations between China and the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries. This is an economic cooperation and trade relationship based on the sincere desire to help each other and seek common economic prosperity. In the past few years, with the help of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, we have imported a large amount of machinery and equipment and important materials necessary for economic construction through foreign trade. In 1953, China also imported a considerable amount of machine tools, power machines, drilling machines, cranes, construction machines, and vehicles from people's democratic countries such as Poland, Democratic Germany, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria, greatly helping China's economic recovery and production development. For example, the large-scale steel rolling mill, seamless steel tube plant, and No. 7 and No. 8 blast furnaces of Anshan Iron and Steel, which were put into production in 1953, were all built with equipment supplied by the Soviet Union and with the help of Soviet experts. In the future, with the further economic prosperity of the countries in the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the further prosperity of the socialist world market, China's economic cooperation and trade relations with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries will continue to develop, and China's exports to the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries will also steadily expand proportionally. Expanding the export of native and specialty products and ensuring the completion of the export plan are of great significance to further promoting the friendship and mutual assistance and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries. This is also a manifestation of the great spirit of internationalism.
    Of course, on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, we are willing to restore and develop commercial and trade relations with various foreign governments and peoples. This is China's consistent foreign trade policy. Although U.S. imperialism has adopted a hostile blockade and embargo policy against the Chinese people, hindering the normal development of international trade, China's trade with the world capitalist market has still developed in recent years. Calculated in US dollars, exports to the world capitalist market in 1953 increased by 23.3 percent compared with 1952. During the Geneva Conference, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of China, Zhou Enlai, pointed out when answering a question from the General Secretary of the British Labour Party: "Although the economic systems of China and the United Kingdom are different, it is possible and necessary for the two countries to develop and expand mutual commercial cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit." This principle also applies to other countries. As long as the governments and business circles of various countries also have the desire to develop mutual trade, we are willing to conduct trade with them. Only in this way can normal international trade relations be further developed.
    We have extremely favorable conditions for expanding the export of native and specialty products. China has a vast countryside, extremely rich native and specialty products, and a certain production base and a lot of experience. Especially recently, the number of farmers participating in the mutual aid and cooperation movement has been increasing, which makes it easier to organize farmers to expand production in a planned way and give full play to the potential of rural native and specialty product production. Therefore, farmers, herdsmen, and handicraft workers should be educated to strive to develop mutual aid and cooperation and produce more native and specialty products for export in accordance with the state plan. This is a glorious responsibility to support socialist industrialization and a major contribution to the great motherland.
    The business departments of foreign trade should strengthen investigation and research work, explore new sources of goods, and actively improve business management, which will greatly help expand the export of native and specialty products. At present, there are still many varieties that we have not organized for export. According to incomplete statistics in 1953, there are more than 1,630 kinds of native and specialty products in China, and state-owned companies directly manage the export of less than 400 kinds. From the fourth quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year, the Shanghai Branch of the China Native Produce Export Corporation has explored a total of 39 commodities that have never been exported in history or have been exported but have been interrupted in recent years, and has now organized 25 kinds for export, increasing the country's foreign exchange by more than 20 billion RMB. The Northwest Foreign Trade Department recently sent a working group to go deep into the production areas to purchase export goods, and discovered 40 to 50 new products that can be exported, including more than 10 kinds of livestock products and more than 30 kinds of native products. Other regions have similar examples. This shows that there are still many materials available for export in China, and the potential is great. As long as the business departments engaged in foreign trade can strengthen investigation and research work, and vigorously improve business management, practice thrift, reduce losses, eliminate accidents, and reduce costs, they will be able to greatly increase the country's export strength.
    To expand exports, in addition to increasing production, promoting thrift is also of special significance. For commodities that are needed abroad but can be saved domestically and have little impact on people's lives, such as meat, eggs, fruits, peanuts, sunflower seeds, etc., we should save domestic consumption as much as possible in order to expand exports. Frozen meat exported in 1953 accounted for only 1.5 percent of the country's pig raising, and the exported eggs were less than one-third of those in 1930 before the war. Obviously, this is very little. If we save some consumption in this area, it will not have a great impact on people's lives, but it will be of great benefit to supporting the country's socialist industrialization. Taking the consumption of pork as an example, except for ethnic minorities and a few people who do not eat pork, if each of the 450 million people in the country can save four ounces of pork per year, the country can save 112.5 million jin a year, which is equivalent to 56,250 tons. If these porks are exported, they can be exchanged for 281,250 tons of steel. With these steel, 40 Chengdu-Chongqing railways can be built, or 187,500 tractors can be manufactured. Conversely, if we do not promote thrift today, with the development of economic construction and the daily improvement of people's lives, then no matter what it is or how much it is, it can be consumed domestically quickly, and there will be nothing to export, and we will not be able to import the machines we need, which will seriously affect socialist industrialization. Everyone knows that some commodities, such as pickled mustard tuber, tea, eggs, and fruits, etc., do not have a big impact on life if we eat a little less, but it would be terrible without socialist industrialization. In the past, we ate pickled mustard tuber, tea, eggs, and fruits for many years, but because there was no industrialization, we were still subjected to imperialist aggression and bullying. Today, we eat a little less of these things and exchange them for more machines to accelerate the realization of national socialist industrialization. This is entirely in line with the fundamental and long-term interests of all the people.
    It must be pointed out here that the above-mentioned need to save the domestic consumption of native and specialty products is actually carried out on the basis of the annual increase in the domestic consumption of native and specialty products. That is to say, under the conditions of completing the national export plan, in general, it is not to reduce the social consumption level compared with the past, but on the contrary, to increase it year by year. For example, the sales volume of pork in Beijing in 1953 was equal to 250 percent of that in 1950, which is a clear example.
    In the task of expanding the export of native and specialty products, the relevant business departments bear direct responsibility. But this is a glorious cause for all the people. Only when each person works hard in his or her own position to expand the export of native and specialty products can we play a major role and make a major contribution to China's socialist industrialization, to the development of the world's democratic peace and socialist camp, to the development of normal trade between countries, and to the cause of maintaining world peace.

    努力增加土产、特产的出口
    钦伟平
    要实现我国的社会主义工业化，除了积极提高现有生产水平以外，还必须不断扩大生产基础，增加新的工厂和矿山，并用头等的机器设备把它们装备起来。由于我国现有的生产与技术水平都还不高，我们需要的这些机器和建筑器材，很大的一部分还要依靠从国外进口；而土产和特产，在我国目前出口物资中的比重相当大。国营土产出口公司一九五二年输往兄弟国家的土产和特产，买成钢轨可以建成从广州到满洲里的铁路一点一四条；一九五三年输出的土、特产品，可以换回二十多个容量二万五千瓩的火力发电厂，可以供给二十多个拥有八十到一百二十万人口的城市的生活用电。这就说明，扩大土产和特产的出口，对支援国家社会主义工业化有着特殊重要的意义。
    全国解放以来，在中国共产党和人民政府的领导和扶持下，我国土、特产生产有了很大发展。如水果、猪肉、鸡蛋、各种山货和羊毛等，都已超过战前生产水平，有力地支持了国家的出口贸易。而这种贸易的扩大，不仅支持了国家经济建设的需要，也给农民、牧民、手工业者带来了很大的好处。我国土、特产在农民总收入中约占百分之三十左右，是农民、牧民、手工业生产者的重要收入来源之一。一九五○年到一九五二年的三年中，国家从农牧民收购的皮张、羊毛、驼毛、羽毛、猪鬃、肠衣等约值五万二千多亿元，相当于六百万农民一年的收入；一九五三年国营公司收购的鸡蛋和蛋品类价值四千七百四十亿元，苹果、桔柑、柚子和香蕉四项水果价值二千零四十五亿元，地方国营公司和合作社收购的还不计算在内。显然的，这对增加农牧民的收入、改善他们的生活，促进农、牧业生产的发展和促进城乡物资交流与巩固工农联盟都起着一定的作用。
    我国对外贸易的主要特点，首先是发展我国和苏联及各人民民主国家的贸易关系，这是基于互相帮助和求得共同经济高涨的真诚愿望的经济合作和贸易关系。几年来，在苏联和各人民民主国家帮助下，通过对外贸易，我们从苏联输入了大量经济建设上所必需的机器设备和重要物资，一九五三年，我国又从波兰、民主德国、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、保加利亚等人民民主国家进口了相当数量的工作母机、动力机、钻探机、起重机、建筑机及车辆等物资，大大地帮助了我国经济的恢复和生产的发展。譬如在一九五三年开始投入生产的鞍钢大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂、第七号和第八号炼铁炉等，都是获得了苏联的设备供应并在苏联专家帮助下建设起来的。今后随着以苏联为首的和平民主和社会主义阵营各国经济的进一步高涨，社会主义世界市场的进一步繁荣，我国和苏联及各人民民主国家的经济合作和贸易关系必将继续发展，我国对苏联及各人民民主国家的输出也必将按比例的稳步扩大。扩大土、特产出口，保证出口计划的完成，对进一步促进我国和苏联及各人民民主国家间的友谊和互助合作关系就具有重要的意义，这也是伟大的国际主义精神的表现。
    当然，在平等互利的基础上，我们愿意与各外国政府和人民恢复并发展通商贸易关系，这是我国一贯执行着的对外贸易政策，尽管美帝国主义采取了敌视中国人民的封锁禁运政策，阻碍着国际间贸易的正常发展，但是几年来我国和世界资本主义市场的贸易还是有了发展。按美元计算，一九五三年对世界资本主义市场出口物资较一九五二年增加了百分之二十三点三，在日内瓦会议期间，我中央人民政府政务院总理兼外交部长周恩来答英国工党总书记的问题时指出：“尽管中英两国的经济制度有所不同，但是两国在平等、互利的基础上发展和扩大相互之间的商业合作，却是可能的和必要的。”这个原则，对其他国家也同样适用。只要各国政府和工商界也同样抱有发展相互贸易的愿望，我们是愿意与他们进行贸易的。只有如此，国际间正常的贸易关系才能进一步发展起来。
    扩大土、特产出口，我们有着极为有利的条件。我国有着广大的农村，土、特产极其丰富，并且生产有一定的基础，也有不少的经验；特别最近以来参加互助合作运动的农户日益增多，这就更便于有计划地组织农民扩大生产，发挥农村土、特产生产的潜力。因此，应该教育农民、牧民、手工业者，努力发展互助合作，按照国家的计划，多多生产可供出口的土、特产。这是支持社会主义工业化的光荣责任，对伟大祖国的重大贡献。
    对外贸易的业务部门，加强调查研究工作，发掘新的货源，并积极改善经营管理，对扩大土、特产出口有很大作用。现在，我们尚未组织出口的品种还很多，据一九五三年不完全的统计，我国土、特产有一千六百三十余种，国营公司直接经营出口的还不到四百种。中国土产出口公司上海分公司从去年第四季度到今年第一季度，共发掘了历史上从未出口或曾经出口而近几年中断了的商品三十九种，现已组织了二十五种出口，给国家增多了二百多亿人民币的外汇。西北对外贸易部门最近派出工作组深入产区收购出口物资，就发现了四、五十种新产品可供出口，其中包括畜产品十余种，土产品三十余种。其他各地区，也有同样的例子。这说明：我国目前可供出口的物资还很多，潜力很大，只要经营对外贸易的业务部门能加强调查研究工作，并大力改善经营管理，厉行节约，减少损耗，杜绝事故，降低成本，就能够大大增加国家的出口力量。
    要扩大出口，除了增加生产而外，提倡节约也具有特殊的重大意义。对于国外需要而国内可以节约一些但对人民生活影响不大的商品如肉类、蛋品、水果、花生、葵花子等，我们应该尽可能地节约国内消费、以便扩大出口。一九五三年出口的冻肉只占全国养猪的百分之一点五，出口的鸡蛋还不及战前一九三○年的三分之一，显然这是很少的。我们如果节约一些这方面的消费，对人民的生活影响不大，而对支持国家社会主义工业化却有莫大的好处。拿猪肉的消费来看，除了少数民族和一部分不吃猪肉的人以外，全国以四亿五千万人口计算，每人每年若能节省四两猪肉，全国一年就可节约一亿一千二百五十万斤，合五万六千二百五十吨。如果拿这些猪肉出口，可以换回二十八万一千二百五十吨钢材。用这些钢材，可以修筑四十条成渝铁路，或制造十八万七千五百部拖拉机。反过来说，今天如果不提倡节约，随着经济建设的发展和人民生活的一天天提高，那末，不管什么东西，也不管多少东西，很快地都可以在国内消费掉，那就没有什么东西可以出口了，也就不能进口我们所需要的机器，这就会严重影响社会主义工业化。大家知道，有些商品如像榨菜、茶叶、鸡蛋、水果等等，我们少吃一点对生活影响并不大，但没有社会主义工业化就不得了。过去，我们吃了许多年榨菜、茶叶、鸡蛋、水果，但由于没有工业化，还是遭受帝国主义的侵略、欺侮。今天，我们少吃一点这些东西多换取一些机器，加速实现国家社会主义工业化，这是完全符合全体人民的根本利益和长远利益的。
    在这里必须指出：上面所称要节约土、特产在国内的消费量，实际上是指土、特产在国内的消费量逐年增加的基础上进行的，也就是说，在完成国家出口计划的条件下，一般的不是使社会的消费水平比以前减少，相反的是逐年增加的，如北京市猪肉一九五三年的销售量，即等于一九五○年的百分之二百五十，这就是一个明显的例子。
    在扩大土、特产出口的任务中，各有关业务部门负有直接的责任。但这是全体人民的光荣事业。只有各人在各人的岗位上，为扩大土、特产出口而努力，那末，在我国社会主义工业化事业中，在发展世界民主和平和社会主义阵营的力量中，发展各国之间的正常贸易、维护世界和平的事业中，就起了重大的作用，作了重大的贡献。
