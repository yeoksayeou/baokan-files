Dalai Lama, Panchen Erdeni, Gentlemen, Comrades:

	Today, at this banquet, please allow me, on behalf of the Central People's Government, to express a warm welcome to the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni upon their arrival in Beijing with the most joyful feelings.

	Over the past three years, Comrade Zhang Jingwu, the representative of the Central People's Government, the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet, and other personnel sent by the Central Government to work in Tibet, with the assistance and cooperation of the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni, and other leaders and monks and laypeople of the Tibetan nationality, have made some achievements in implementing the Central Government's ethnic and foreign policies. Let me take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni, patriotic officials in Tibet, and the monks and laypeople.

	Over the past three years, the unity of all ethnic groups in China and the internal unity of Tibet have become increasingly close. The privileges left behind by imperialism in Tibet have been abolished in practice, and the political, economic, and cultural development of Tibet has progressed to varying degrees. These achievements are the result of the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, and they are also inseparable from the efforts of the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni, and other patriotic leaders in Tibet, especially the continuous promotion of patriotism in Tibet. At present, the various manifestations of the Tibetan people's love for the motherland, and the arrival of the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni, and other Tibetan national representatives in Beijing to attend the National People's Congress, are the clearest expressions of this patriotism.

	The People's Republic of China's minority nationalities' love for the common motherland of all nationalities is consistent with their love for their own religious beliefs and customs. This is because there is not only no national oppression in our country, but also full respect for the freedom of religious beliefs and customs of all nationalities. Only by fully taking into account the characteristics of the development of all nationalities can we unite all nationalities, promote the enthusiasm and creativity of the people of all nationalities, and enable the people of all nationalities to actively participate in the economic and cultural construction of their own ethnic regions, to cooperate with the construction work of the entire country. At the same time, the construction work in the minority nationality areas can only develop rapidly with the help of the people of all fraternal nationalities in the motherland. The motherland is carrying out the construction of national industrialization, and the motherland is moving forward step by step. We believe that in the big family of the motherland, all nationalities will move forward step by step.

	The Central People's Government welcomes the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni for taking some measures that are beneficial to the Tibetan nationality and the Tibetan people in the past three years. Some Tibetan officials who came to the mainland for visits in the past have requested the Central Government to help Tibet develop industry, commerce, agriculture and animal husbandry. This is very good. It is the bounden duty of the Central People's Government to develop the economy and culture of all nationalities. However, due to the current transportation difficulties and other conditions, the assistance to Tibet is still not great. We believe that difficulties can be gradually overcome, and the Central Government's assistance to Tibet will gradually increase.

	Tibet is a place rich in resources and has the conditions to build a prosperous and happy new Tibet. In the big family of all ethnic groups in China, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, the future of Tibet is bright. I would like to congratulate here on the bright future of the Tibetan nationality.

	Finally, let me propose a toast to the health of the Dalai Lama, to the health of the Panchen Erdeni, to the health of Representative Zhang Jingwu, to the health of the National People's Congress representatives from the Tibetan region, and to the health of all the monks and lay officials in the Tibetan region present here!

    在欢迎达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼宴会上
    朱德副主席的欢迎词达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼、各位先生、各位同志：
    今天，在这个宴会上，请允许我代表中央人民政府，以最愉快的心情，对达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼的莅京，表示热烈的欢迎。
    三年来，中央人民政府代表张经武同志、驻藏的中国人民解放军和中央派在西藏工作的其他人员，因为获得了达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼和西藏民族的其他领导人物和僧俗人民的协助和合作，在执行中央的民族政策和外交政策上，有了一些成就。让我在这里首先对达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼、西藏地方的爱国官员和僧俗人民表示感谢。
    三年来，中国各民族的团结和西藏内部的团结日渐亲密，帝国主义在西藏遗留下来的特权从实际生活中废除了，西藏地方的政治、经济、文化，都有程度不同的发展。这些成就是中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的英明领导的结果，也是和达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼及西藏其他爱国领袖人物的努力分不开的，特别是和爱国主义在西藏不断地发扬分不开的。现在，西藏人民热爱祖国的种种表现，达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼及其他西藏民族代表到北京来出席全国人民代表大会会议，都是这种爱国主义发扬的最明白的表现。
    中华人民共和国的少数民族爱护各民族人民共同的祖国和爱护各民族自己的宗教信仰和风俗习惯是一致的，这是因为在我们的国家不只没有民族压迫，而且充分地尊重各民族宗教信仰和风俗习惯的自由，因为只有充分地照顾各民族发展的特点，才有可能团结各民族，发扬各民族人民的积极性和创造性，使各民族人民积极地参加本民族地区的经济和文化的建设事业，来配合整个国家的建设工作。同时，各少数民族地区的建设工作，也只有在祖国各兄弟民族人民的帮助下，才能迅速地发展。祖国正在进行着国家工业化的建设，祖国正在一步一步地前进着，我们相信，在祖国的大家庭里，各个民族都会一步一步地前进着。
    达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼，过去三年来，采取了一些对西藏民族和西藏人民有利的措施，中央人民政府都是欢迎的。过去到内地来参观的一些西藏官员，都曾要求中央帮助西藏发展工商业和农牧业。这是很好的。发展各民族的经济和文化，是中央人民政府应尽的责任，只是目前由于交通困难和其他条件不具备，对西藏帮助还不大，我们相信，困难是能够逐步克服的，中央对西藏的帮助是会逐渐增多起来的。
    西藏是一个资源丰富的地方，具有建设繁荣、幸福新西藏的条件。在中国各民族大家庭内，在共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的领导下，西藏的前景是光明的。我在这里为西藏民族的光明前途祝贺。
    最后，让我为达赖喇嘛的健康、为班禅额尔德尼的健康、为张经武代表的健康、为西藏地区全国人民代表大会代表的健康、为在座的西藏地区的全体僧俗官员的健康干杯！
