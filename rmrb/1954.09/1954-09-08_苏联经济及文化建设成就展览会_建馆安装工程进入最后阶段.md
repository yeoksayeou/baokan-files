Exhibition of Achievements in Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction:
    Construction and Installation Enters Final Stage

    [This newspaper] (reported) The construction of the Exhibition of Achievements in Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction has reached its most intense stage. Machine installation and construction projects are proceeding rapidly under the guidance of Soviet experts.

    The architectural work on the exhibition halls is largely complete. Workers are now busily carrying out individual finishing touches and cleaning. The exhibition hall work area and the Beijing Electric Power Bureau conducted a comprehensive inspection and repair of the entire exhibition hall's electrical equipment on the 7th and 8th.

    Currently, workers are building reflective light troughs around the base of the gilded iron tower, preparing to install reflective lights. At night, the streetlights on the railings around the garden, the reflective lights around the gilded iron tower, and the red five-pointed star on the tower will illuminate each other, making the entire building even more magnificent and splendid.

    The installation of machinery inside the halls is proceeding intensely. Various machine tools inside the Industrial Hall have been installed, and 50% of these machines have been test-run with good results. 98% of the agricultural machinery in the West Square has been installed, and 20% of it has been test-run. 82% of the mining machinery in the East Square has also been installed, and half of it has been test-run. The Railway Square behind the third square—the open-air theater—has begun preparations for the installation of equipment such as train locomotives.

    The exhibition stands in the Agricultural Hall and the Cultural Hall are all ready and are being positioned. The vast majority of exhibit boxes have been opened. The staff of the Exhibit Section is carrying out the final stage of preparations, and will begin displaying the exhibits as soon as the Soviet experts arrive. Soviet experts in charge of leading and managing the restaurant are guiding workers to install various electric stoves and other equipment for the kitchen.
