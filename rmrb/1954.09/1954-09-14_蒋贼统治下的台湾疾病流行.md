Disease epidemics are rampant in Taiwan under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.

The people of Taiwan suffer increasingly from disease, especially tuberculosis, due to the cruel exploitation of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and their increasingly impoverished lives. According to figures released by the pseudo-Taiwan Provincial Tuberculosis Prevention Association, there are currently approximately 160,000 to 180,000 tuberculosis patients in Taiwan, of whom 40,000 are seriously ill and unable to work. Taiwanese newspapers reveal that a tuberculin test survey conducted throughout Taiwan showed that an average of 30 percent of elementary school students tested positive (i.e., infected with the tuberculosis bacillus), with the rate as high as 60 percent in Keelung. Twenty percent of dockworkers in Keelung suffer from lung disease. In Hsiulin Township, Hualien County, approximately 5,000 members of the mountain tribes suffer from lung disease, accounting for 60 percent of the township's population. Taiwanese newspapers admit that the high number of tuberculosis patients is due to "poor housing, poor nutrition, and overwork."

Many Taiwanese women struggling in hunger are forced into prostitution to make a living, and as a result, venereal diseases are extremely prevalent in Taiwan. Venereal diseases are not only prevalent in the cities, but also spread to the mountains, seriously endangering the health of the mountain people. However, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique recently plans to restore the "public prostitution system" in order to increase tax revenue. This will make venereal diseases even more rampant in Taiwan.

The people of Taiwan also suffer greatly from diseases such as malaria, dysentery, and influenza. On Orchid Island, most deaths are caused by malaria and diarrhea.

The main reason for the prevalence of disease in Taiwan is the corrupt rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique uses the money plundered from the people of Taiwan entirely for expanding the army, raising secret agents, and engaging in corruption, showing no concern for the people's lives. For example, the pseudo-Taipei Municipal Government spends very little on public health each year. In this year's budget of 172.2 million pseudo-Taiwan dollars, only 300,000 pseudo-Taiwan dollars are used for building public toilets and setting up garbage bins, which are related to environmental hygiene. As a result, the streets and alleys of Taipei are filled with garbage, filth is everywhere, and the drains are blocked, causing the large-scale breeding of flies and mosquitoes, leading to the prevalence of malaria and many other diseases.

### 蒋贼统治下的台湾疾病流行

    蒋贼统治下的台湾疾病流行
    蒋介石卖国集团统治下的台湾疾病流行。
    台湾人民由于蒋介石卖国集团的残酷剥削，生活日益困苦，以致患肺病者日益增多。据伪台湾省防痨协会发表的数字，目前台湾约有肺结核病患者十六万人至十八万人，其中四万人病情严重，不能工作。台湾报纸透露，台湾全省施行结核菌素反应检查结果，小学生反应阳性者（即感染肺结核菌者）平均达百分之三十，其中基隆一地高达百分之六十。基隆市码头工人患肺病的占百分之二十。花莲县秀林乡高山族人民患肺病者约达五千人之多，占全乡人口百分之六十。台湾报纸承认，肺病患者如此之多，原因是“居所不良，营养太差，操劳过度”。
    在饥饿中挣扎的不少台湾妇女为生活所迫，沦为娼妓，因而性病在台湾极为流行。性病不但在城市中流行，而且传布到山地中，并已严重危害了高山族人民的健康。但是，蒋介石卖国集团最近为了增加税收，还准备恢复“公娼制度”。这将使性病在台湾更加猖獗。
    台湾人民患疟疾、痢疾、流行性感冒等疾病的也极多。在兰屿岛，大多数人的死亡原因都是由于患疟疾和下痢。
    台湾疾病流行的主要原因，就是蒋介石卖国集团的腐朽统治。蒋介石卖国集团把从台湾人民手里搜括得来的钱，完全用于扩充军队，豢养特务，贪污腐化，对人民生活毫不关心。例如，伪台北市政府每年支出的公共卫生费用很少，今年度的岁出预算一亿七千二百多万元伪台币中，用于修建公共厕所和设置垃圾箱等与环境卫生有关的费用只有三十万元伪台币。结果台北大街小巷都堆满了垃圾，污秽遍地，水沟淤塞，苍蝇和蚊子大量滋生，造成了疟疾和其他许多疾病流行。（据新华社讯）
