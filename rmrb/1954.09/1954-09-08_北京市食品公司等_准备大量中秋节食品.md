Beijing Food Company and Others
Prepare Large Quantities of Mid-Autumn Festival Food

The China Food Company Beijing Branch and the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative have prepared a large quantity of Mid-Autumn Festival food for the people of the capital. In early August, purchasing agents from the China Food Company Beijing Branch set off to the northwest regions of Gansu and the grasslands of Inner Mongolia to purchase cattle and sheep. Now, apples from the Northeast, bananas from Guangdong, and other items are being transported to Beijing in a steady stream. The Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative has purchased and organized the processing of a batch of meat, fish, fruit, mooncakes, and other foods; the quantity of some goods has increased by about double compared to last year. To facilitate citizens' purchase of holiday food, the urban consumer cooperatives will set up some temporary fruit and meat stalls. (Yang Xinggeng, et al.)

    北京市食品公司等
    准备大量中秋节食品
    中国食品公司北京市公司和北京市供销合作总社已经为首都人民准备好大批中秋节食品。在八月初，中国食品公司北京市公司的采购员就出发到西北区的甘肃和内蒙古草原采购牛羊。现在东北的苹果、广东的香蕉等已经源源运来北京。北京市供销合作总社已经采购和组织加工了一批肉、鱼、水果、月饼等食品；有些商品的数量，比去年增加一倍左右。为了便利市民购买节日食品，城区消费合作社将设立一部分临时水果摊和肉摊。（杨兴赓等）
