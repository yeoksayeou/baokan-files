On the Tenth Anniversary of Bulgaria's Liberation Held in Sofia
Report by Chairman Chervenkov (Summary)

Sofia, September 8th. Chervenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, delivered a report at the celebration of the tenth anniversary of Bulgaria's liberation in Sofia.

Chervenkov said: Ten years ago, the Soviet army, in pursuit of the defeated Hitlerite troops, entered Bulgaria as an army liberating our people. Our people, uniting all patriotic forces under the leadership of the Communist Party in the Fatherland Front, and relying on the victory of the Soviet army, launched an armed uprising, overthrew the fascist dictatorship, and established their own regime.

September 9, 1944, witnessed an unprecedented great turning point in the historical development of our country. For the first time in history, the Bulgarian people became masters of their own destiny, and had full possibilities to arrange their lives and their relations with other peoples and other countries, especially to determine their present and future according to their own interests. The basic means of production and the basic wealth of the country have become the property of the people. Our people are following the socialist path in accordance with the example of the Soviet people. Only socialism is sufficient to guarantee the real freedom and true national independence of our people, and is sufficient to ensure the great development of the people's creativity and the continuous improvement of material and cultural welfare.

After detailing the anti-fascist struggle of the Bulgarian people, Chervenkov said: Fascism failed to subdue the people. The vast majority of the people remained loyal to their democratic traditions, and loyal to the legacy of the thousands of people's heroes and martyrs who sacrificed themselves in the struggle against the dark forces of fascism. The Bulgarian Communist Party constantly learned from its mistakes, overcame numerous and significant difficulties at the cost of great sacrifices, and stood unswervingly at the forefront of the working people. It resolutely united the strength of the working people in a broad anti-fascist front and led them forward. During the Second World War, according to the initiative of the Communist Party led by our leader and mentor Georgi Dimitrov, our people united all progressive forces in a strong Fatherland Front and extensively launched a struggle by all means to overthrow the fascist dictatorship.

If the liberating Soviet army had not entered our country in September 1944, Bulgaria would have probably suffered the terrible fate of falling into the hands of the imperialists across the ocean, and perhaps would still be in the miserable situation of an impoverished country being plundered, still the prey of plunderers.

Our people will never forget, and will always remember with extreme gratitude: the Soviet army saved them from great disasters, the danger of civil war, and foreign enslavement in September 1944. Our people will never forget, and will always remember with heartfelt thanks: after they won the victory of September 9th, only thanks to the Soviet Union were they able to avoid starvation, to restore the destroyed national economy, and to embark on the construction of socialism. Our people will never forget and cannot forget: they were able to lay the foundation of socialism and are flourishing in construction because of the invaluable and comprehensive support given by the Soviet Union.

Today, I am honored to be able to warmly welcome from this platform, on behalf of all our people, the representatives of our liberator, the great Soviet Union, to participate in our grandest National Day, and to express our warm respect to them.

Chervenkov then said that on the great festival of our country, our people will not forget the countless heroes and martyrs who gave their lives in the long and arduous struggle for the liberation of the motherland; they were hanged, shot, beheaded, burned alive, and brutally murdered. May they live forever and their names be passed down through the ages!

May the martyrs of the Soviet liberation army who sacrificed themselves in the battle for the freedom and independence of the great Soviet Union, for freeing the people of all countries from fascist enslavement, live forever and their names be passed down through the ages! On this great festival, our people swear to maintain Bulgarian-Soviet friendship with all our strength. The historical event of September 9, 1944, is the triumph of Bulgarian-Soviet friendship, and the triumph of the profound conviction of the people that only this friendship is the unshakable guarantee and pillar of Bulgaria's independence and correct development in line with the vital interests of the Bulgarian people.

The past decade has brilliantly confirmed that the socialist development path we have adopted is correct.

From a historical point of view, ten years is not a long time. But, please take a look: how much has our motherland changed, what have our people done in these ten years, please take a look at what the people can do when they have mastered their own destiny, are working for themselves and their country; when they have the support of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries; when they become an active member of the great world peace army! The whole country, all the cities and villages are under construction. This is a huge construction site for building a new life. The country's productive forces and national culture are rising unprecedentedly.

Now, our people have the right to be proud of the new Bulgaria, the socialist Bulgaria, rebuilt from the ruins. We have the right to say that we have achieved great achievements in all aspects of our lives. These achievements have fundamentally changed life, making life better day by day, happier day by day, and more beautiful day by day.

We have the right to rejoice and feel truly satisfied, because we realize that in the past ten years, our strength has been immeasurably consolidated and united, our country has been strengthened, its international status has been improved, and living conditions have been improved, and most importantly: the necessary prerequisites have been created for the rise of material welfare and cultural level, which even the boldest genius among the people dared not dream of in the past.

In the past ten years, the people's regime has transformed Bulgaria from an extremely backward agricultural country into an industrial-agricultural country with rapidly developing heavy industry, established and consolidated the planned leadership of the national economy without crisis, and eliminated unemployment and poverty.

In the past ten years, new industrial sectors have emerged in our country, such as machine manufacturing, shipbuilding, mining, cellulose industry, electrical industry, ferrous metallurgy, and non-ferrous metallurgy, which either did not exist at all or were just sprouting before September 9, 1944.

The total industrial output in 1953 was about five times that of 1939. The production of means of production in 1953 was about nine times that of 1939, while the output of consumer goods was about four times that of 1939.

In the ten years of the people's regime, the amount of hard coal mined is equivalent to the output of the entire bourgeois rule. The electricity production in 1953 alone exceeded the output of the entire period from 1930 to 1939.

Compared with 1939, the production of the metal processing industry in 1953 increased by about twenty-seven times, the wood processing industry increased by more than five times, ceramics increased by twenty-one times, the glass industry increased by more than six times, and cellulose and pulp increased by almost four times. The production of building materials increased by seven times, structural iron and iron plates increased by two and a half times, and cement increased by more than three times. The production of daily necessities at the end of the first five-year plan increased by three times compared with the pre-war level. Among them, the production of cotton fabrics increased by about three and a half times, the production of wool fabrics increased by about two times, the production of ultramarine increased by thirty-six times, and the production of metal utensils increased by six times.

Before September 9, 1944, the production of domestic agricultural machinery was only in its infancy. However, at present, our industry produces almost all kinds of agricultural machinery in large quantities.

The people's democratic regime has led our agriculture onto the bright and broad socialist road. Now, agriculture owns more than 14,000 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower). Before September 9, 1944, our country did not know what a combine harvester was. Now we have almost 1,800 Soviet-style combine harvesters. In 1953, the irrigated area exceeded 2.5 million decares (each decare is about one and a half mu), which is an increase of about seven times compared with 1939.

The national income in 1953 was almost more than double that of 1939. Three-quarters of the national income is used to meet the needs of residents.

What the bourgeoisie left us was an unstable lev (Bulgarian currency) and a comprehensive rationing system. Now our lev has a solid foundation and is becoming increasingly consolidated; the rationing system has also been abolished. Our socialist trade is constantly expanding and improving. Prices have been reduced four times in the last two years.

Everyone knows that our country no longer needs to import grain to supply residents. We have no unemployment and crisis. The people's regime is fully concerned about continuously improving the living standards of residents.

The task put forward by the Sixth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party—to rapidly improve the material and cultural level of the working people in the near future—has been responded to by the entire people, and successfully completing this task is the current main task.

The last part of Chervenkov's report talked about the struggle for peace jointly carried out by the Bulgarian people and the people of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. He said that only socialist construction can guarantee the continuous improvement of the people's living conditions, and this construction requires lasting peace. Therefore, we are fully defending peace, supporting all initiatives that demand the easing of international tensions, defending peace, resolving disputes and outstanding issues through consultation, and avoiding wars that contain destruction and pain. The Soviet Union's consistent and wise peace policy is in line with the interests of our people and the interests of the people of all countries. Our people are very happy to welcome every achievement of this policy of the world's peace forces.

We are satisfied to point out that the efforts to restore diplomatic relations with Greece have been successful. The outstanding issues between our country and Greece can and must be resolved in a way that is beneficial to both sides. The relations between our country and Turkey and Yugoslavia can and must be improved, because this improvement is in line with our mutual interests and the interests of the people of the world.

Chervenkov said that Bulgaria hopes to maintain not only normal but also good relations with all its neighbors without exception. Bulgaria yearns for tranquility and peace in the Balkans and Europe, above all else.

Chervenkov concluded by saying: We should not be overwhelmed by our successes, thinking that there are no more difficulties and obstacles on our road, that the class struggle has subsided in our country, and that the enemy has abandoned its attempts to obstruct us, destroy the fruits of the people's labor, and gradually disintegrate the great cause of September 9, 1944. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen and heighten vigilance, resolutely overcome obstacles and difficulties, and never forget: the capitalist encirclement still exists, and the greater our achievements, the more despicable the forms of resistance adopted by the enemy.

Brothers and sisters! Move forward! Work harder and more fruitfully to complete the resolutions of the Sixth Party Congress, push the socialist competition to a new upsurge, create new labor achievements, and achieve new victories in the second decade of the establishment of the people's regime!

Glory to our dear and rock-solid Communist Party! All the victories of the people are the result of its wise and well-tempered policies. Because the party has countless cadres with selfless spirit, Marxist-Leninist ideological training, iron discipline, and loyalty, the party is the guarantee of greater victories in the future.

Glory to the hard-working, enterprising, and excellent people of our country, united under the banner of the Fatherland Front, and to the fighting alliance of workers and peasants!

The people are united in the Fatherland Front under the leadership of the Communist Party, which is the guarantee of new and greater achievements.

Bulgarian-Soviet friendship, our people's love and loyalty to the great Soviet Union and the great Soviet Communist Party, is also such a guarantee.

The road experienced by our people on September 9, 1944, is a historically tested and victorious road.

Peace, a richer life, and the prosperity of our people, who are united as brothers with the people of all countries led by the Soviet Union, in material and spiritual life, is the most important of all our goals.

Long live our liberator and protector—the great Soviet Union!

Long live the great Soviet Communist Party!

Long live our dear socialist motherland, the people's Bulgaria!

Long live the Fatherland Front!

Long live the long-tested leader of our people—the Bulgarian Communist Party!

Long live world peace!

    在索非亚举行的保加利亚解放十周年庆祝大会上
    契尔文科夫主席的报告（摘要）
    九月八日，保加利亚人民共和国部长会议主席契尔文科夫在索非亚举行的保加利亚解放十周年庆祝大会上做了报告。
    契尔文科夫说：十年前，苏联军队追击溃败的希特勒军队，作为一支解放我国人民的大军进入了保加利亚，我国人民把全体爱国力量团结在以共产党为首的祖国阵线下，依靠苏军的胜利，发动了武装起义，推翻了法西斯独裁政权，建立了自己的政权。
      一九四四年九月九日发生了我国历史发展上空前的大转变。保加利亚人民有史以来第一次成为自己命运的主人，有了充分的可能来安排自己的生活和对其他人民和其他国家的关系，特别是按照自己本身的利益来决定自己的现在和将来。基本的生产资料和国内基本的财富已成为人民的财产。我国人民按照苏联人民的榜样走社会主义的道路，只有社会主义足以保障我国人民的真正的自由、真正的民族独立，足以保证人民创造力的发扬光大以及物质和文化福利状况的不断提高。
    在详细叙述了保加利亚人民的反法西斯斗争之后，契尔文科夫说：法西斯主义没有能使人民屈服。人民绝大多数仍旧忠实于自己的民主传统，忠实于在反抗法西斯黑暗势力的斗争中牺牲的数千人民英雄和烈士的遗训。保加利亚共产党不断从错误中吸取教训，以巨大的牺牲的代价克服了重重的重大的困难，而毫不动摇地站在劳动人民的前列，它坚决地把劳动人民的力量团结在广泛的反法西斯阵线内，并领导着他们前进。在第二次世界大战期间，根据以我们的领袖和导师格奥尔基·季米特洛夫为首的共产党的创议和在它的领导下，我国人民把一切进步力量团结在强大的祖国阵线中，广泛地展开用一切手段推翻法西斯独裁政权的斗争。
    如果不是解放者——苏联军队在一九四四年九月进入我国，保加利亚恐怕就遭到落进大洋彼岸帝国主义者之手的可怕的命运，也许一直到现在还处在一个受掠夺的贫困国家的悲惨境地，还是掠夺者的猎物。
    我国人民永远不会忘记，并将怀着极其感激的心情永远记住：一九四四年九月苏军拯救了他们，使他们免于巨大的灾祸、内战的危险和外国的奴役。我国人民永远不会忘记，并将怀着热诚感谢的心情永远记住：他们在获得九月九日的胜利后，只是多亏苏联才避免了饥饿，才有可能恢复破坏了的国民经济和着手建设社会主义。我国人民永远不会忘记并且不能忘记：他们所以能够奠定社会主义的基础，所以能够在建设方面蒸蒸日上，是应当感激苏联给予的不可估量的全面支持的。
    今天，我很荣幸能从这个讲台上代表我国全体人民热诚欢迎我们的解放者、伟大的苏联的代表参加我们最盛大的国庆节，并向他们表示热情的敬意。
    契尔文科夫接着说，在我国的伟大的节日里，我国人民不会忘记无数的英雄烈士，他们在争取祖国解放的长期艰苦斗争中献出了自己的生命；他们被绞死、射杀、砍头、活活地烧死，被惨无人道地杀害。愿他们永垂千古，流芳百世！
    愿那些在为伟大的苏联的自由和独立，为使各国人民免遭法西斯奴役的战斗中牺牲的苏联解放大军的烈士永垂千古，流芳百世！在这个伟大的节日里，我国人民誓以全力维护保苏友谊。一九四四年九月九日的历史事迹是保苏友谊的凯旋，是人民这样一种深刻信念的凯旋：他们深信，只有这种友谊才是保加利亚的独立和符合于保加利亚人民切身利益的正确发展的不可动摇的保证和支柱。
    过去的十年辉煌地证实了，我国采取的社会主义发展的方针是正确的。
    从历史的观点来看，十年是一段并不长的时间。但是，请大家看看：我们祖国发生了多么大的变化，这十年来我国人民做了什么样的事情啊，请看看当人民掌握了自己的命运，在为自己和自己的国家劳动；当他们获得苏联和人民民主国家的支持；当他们成为伟大的世界和平大军中积极的一分子以后，他们能做出什么样的事情来啊！整个国家，所有的城市和乡村都在进行着建设。这是一个建设新生活的庞大工地。全国的生产力和民族文化正在空前高涨中。
    现在，我国人民有权为从废墟中重建起来的新保加利亚，社会主义的保加利亚而感到骄傲。我们有权说我们生活的各方面获得了巨大成就，这些成就根本改变了生活，使生活一天比一天好，一天比一天幸福，一天比一天美丽。
    我们有权欢欣鼓舞，并感到真正的满意，因为我们意识到，在过去十年中，我们的力量是不可估量地巩固和团结起来了，我们的国家巩固了，国际地位提高了，生活条件改善了，而最重要的是：为物质福利和文化水平的高涨创造了必要的先决条件，这在过去就是人民中最大胆的天才也不敢梦想的。
    十年来，人民政权把保加利亚由极落后的农业国变成一个重工业迅速发展的工业—农业国家，建立并巩固了对没有危机的国民经济的有计划领导，消灭了失业和贫困现象。
    在过去十年中，在我国出现了新的工业部门，如机器制造业、造船业、采矿业、纤维素工业、电气工业、黑色金属冶炼业和有色金属冶炼业，这些工业在一九四四年九月九日以前不是根本没有就是刚才萌芽。
    一九五三年的工业总产量约为一九三九年的五倍。一九五三年生产资料的生产量约为一九三九年的九倍，而消费品的产量约为一九三九年的四倍。
    在人民政权的十年中，硬煤的开采量相当于整个资产阶级统治年代的产量。仅仅一九五三年一年的电力生产量就超过一九三零年到一九三九年整个时期的产量。
    和一九三九年比较，一九五三年金属加工工业的生产约增加为二十七倍，木材加工工业增加为五倍多，陶磁器增加为二十一倍，玻璃工业增加为六倍多，纤维素和纸浆差不多增加为四倍。建筑材料的生产增加为七倍，结构用铁和铁板增加为两倍半，水泥增加为三倍以上。日用品的生产在第一个五年计划结束时增加为战前水平的三倍，其中，棉织品的生产约增为三倍半，毛织品的生产约增为两倍，石青的生产增加为三十六倍，金属器皿的生产增加为六倍。
    在一九四四年九月九日以前，本国的农业机器的生产还只是处在萌芽的时期。但是，目前我们的工业大量地出产了几乎所有种类的农业机器。
    人民民主政权把我们的农业引上了光明广阔的社会主义道路上。现在，农业拥有一万四千多台拖拉机（每台以十五匹马力计算）。在一九四四年九月九日以前，我们国家还不知道什么是收割联合机。现在我们差不多有一千八百部苏联式样的收割联合机。一九五三年灌溉面积超过二百五十万狄卡尔（每狄卡尔约合一市亩半），也就是增加为一九三九年的七倍左右。
    一九五三年的国民收入差不多超过一九三九年的一倍。国民收入的四分之三用于满足居民的需要。
    资产阶级给我们遗留下的是不稳定的利瓦（保币名）和全面的配给制度。现在我们的利瓦有着稳定的基础，并且日益巩固；配给制也取消了。我们社会主义的贸易不断地扩大和改进。在最近两年中曾四次减低物价。
      大家知道，我们国家已不需要输入粮食来供给居民。我们没有失业和危机。人民政权全力关怀不断提高居民的生活水平。
      保加利亚共产党第六次代表大会所提出的任务——在最近期间内急速提高劳动人民的物质和文化水平——得到全体人民的响应，胜利地完成这一工作就是当前的主要任务。
      契尔文科夫报告的最后一部分谈到保加利亚人民和苏联及各人民民主国家人民所共同进行的争取和平的斗争。他说，只有社会主义建设能够保证不断提高人民的生活条件，而这种建设需要持久的和平。因此，我们全力保卫和平，支持一切要求缓和国际紧张局势、保卫和平、通过协商解决纠纷和未决的问题、以及避免那包藏着破坏和痛苦的战争的倡议。苏联的一贯的和英明的和平政策符合我国人民的利益，同时也符合各国人民的利益。我国人民十分高兴地欢迎全世界和平力量的这一政策的每一成就。
    我们满意地指出，和希腊恢复外交关系的努力成功了。我国和希腊之间尚待解决的问题，是可以并且必须获得有利于双方的解决的。我国和土耳其以及和南斯拉夫的关系是可以并且必须得到改善的，因为这种改善符合我们彼此的利益，也符合世界人民的利益。
    契尔文科夫说，保加利亚希望毫无例外地和所有的邻国保持有不但正常、而且良好的关系。保加利亚渴望巴尔干和欧洲的安宁和和平，超过一切其他的东西。
    契尔文科夫最后说：我们不应该冲昏了头脑，认为在我们的道路上已不再有困难和障碍，认为阶级斗争在我国已平息了，认为敌人已放弃了阻挠我们、破坏人民的劳动果实和逐渐瓦解一九四四年九月九日伟大事业的企图。因此，必须要加强和提高警惕，坚决地克服障碍和困难，一刻也不要忘记：资本主义包围还是存在，我们的成绩越大，敌人采取的反抗的形式也越卑劣。
    兄弟姊妹们！前进吧！为完成第六次党代表大会的决议而更紧张、更有成果地工作，把社会主义竞赛推向新的高涨，创造新的劳动功绩，在人民政权建立的第二个十年中取得新的胜利！
    光荣属于我们的亲切的磐石般巩固的共产党！一切人民的胜利都是它的英明的和千锤百炼的政策的成果。由于党的无数的干部具有忘我的精神、马克思主义列宁主义的思想锻炼、铁的纪律和忠诚，党就是未来的更大的胜利的保证。
    光荣属于团结在祖国阵线旗帜下热爱劳动的、有进取心的、优秀的我国人民，属于战斗的工农联盟！
    人民一致团结在共产党领导下的祖国阵线中，这是新的、更大的成就的保证。
    保苏的友谊、我国人民对伟大的苏联和伟大的苏联共产党的热爱和忠诚也是这种保证。
    一九四四年九月九日我国人民所经历的道路是已经过历史考验的、胜利的道路。
    和平，更富裕的生活，和以苏联为首的各国人民结为兄弟的我国人民在物质生活和精神生活上的繁荣，这就是我们的一切目的中最重要的一个目的。
    我们的解放者和保护者——伟大的苏联万岁！
    伟大的苏联共产党万岁！
    我们亲爱的社会主义祖国、人民的保加利亚万岁！
    祖国阵线万岁！
    久经锻炼的我国人民的领导者——保加利亚共产党万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
