    The Face of Highway Transportation is Changing
    An Lifu, Representative of the National People's Congress, Chairman of the Chinese Highway Transport Trade Union
    Over the past five years, China's highway transportation industry has developed rapidly, gradually changing the backward face of highway transportation in old China.
    Before liberation, although some highways were built in China, most of them were of poor quality, and the route distribution was extremely unreasonable. Some highways were just a "completed" red line drawn on the map, but in reality, they were not passable. For example, the Sichuan-Xikang-Qinghai Highway was only test-driven once. The car got stuck in a mud pit halfway, so it had to be disassembled into parts and carried back to Garze by yaks. After that, no one cared about this route anymore.
    In the five years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, not only have the highways severely damaged by the Chiang Kai-shek gang's collapse been repaired, but also the construction and renovation of the Kangding-Tibet, Qinghai-Tibet, Kunming-Luoyang, Chengdu-Aba, Gansu-Qinghai and other highways have been carried out and are being carried out. In 1953, the mileage of highways open to traffic increased by 33 percent compared with 1950. After vigorous repairs and additions of cars, in 1953, state-owned cars increased by 115 percent compared with 1950, the business mileage of cars increased by 69 percent compared with 1950, and the volume of transportation increased by 356 percent compared with 1950.
    The newly built highways are mostly in ethnic minority areas and mountainous areas. Many of these places used to be uninhabited primeval forests and marginal areas, and the project was extremely difficult. The military workers, civilian workers and the broad masses of people who built the roads, under the call of the Party and the government, overcame various difficulties and fought against nature. They often shoveled away snow and dug up soil in the snowy plateaus and grasslands, on the high mountains with minus 20 to 30 degrees, freezing winds, and thin air, and used ropes to hang on their waists, drilling holes and blasting on the cliffs where they could not stand. The harsh environment and arduous work could not stop their determination to build highways. "High mountains are not as high as our feet, and hard stones are not as hard as our will." This high degree of patriotic labor enthusiasm and tenacious fighting will enabled China's highway construction to rapidly advance to new areas.
    Automobile transport workers have been working hard to improve labor productivity. In 1953, the labor productivity of the automobile transport industry increased by 50 percent compared with 1952. Transportation costs and freight rates have been reduced accordingly. In 1953, the liquid passenger freight rate of automobiles was reduced by 33.61 percent compared with 1951, and the liquid cargo freight rate was reduced by 35.21 percent compared with 1951.
    The development of highway transportation has played a certain role in the development of industrial and agricultural production and the improvement of people's lives along the line, especially the highway construction in ethnic minority areas, which has promoted the development of political, economic and cultural undertakings of various ethnic minorities. The lives of people of all ethnic groups are becoming more and more stable, and new towns have emerged. Local products that could not be transported out in the past are gradually being transported to other places, and industrial products that were rarely seen before have appeared in these ethnic minority areas, and are constantly increasing. In the first month after the Kunming-Luoyang Highway was opened to Cheli, the materials transported to the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture increased by more than four times compared with before the opening of the highway. The amount of salt transported in one month was close to the sales volume in the first half of 1953. These vivid facts made the ethnic minorities personally realize the greatness of Chairman Mao's ethnic policy and feel the warmth of the motherland's ethnic family. They supported highway construction with great enthusiasm. On the Kangding-Tibet Highway, the Tibetan people organized thousands of yaks, day and night, to cross mountains and support the progress of the project. On the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, the Tibetan people carried fresh milk and butter from 20 miles away in the morning and delivered them to the construction site. On the Chengdu-Aba Highway, people of all ethnic groups organized dance teams to hold慰问 (condolence/comfort) performances at the construction site, and the lamas of the temples along the line also presented hada to the road construction workers.
    In the great cause of realizing the socialist industrialization of the motherland, the tasks of highway construction and highway transportation are becoming increasingly heavy. All highway transportation workers are fighting for this great task. (Attached picture)

    公路运输的面貌在改变着
    全国人民代表大会代表 中国公路运输工会主席  安力夫
    五年来，我国公路运输事业日益发展，逐步改变了旧中国公路运输的落后面貌。
    解放前，中国虽也建筑了一些公路，但大都粗制滥造，路质低劣，路线分布极不合理。有些公路只是在地图上划着一条“已成”的红线，实际上并不通车。如川康青公路，仅作过一次试车，汽车走到中途陷入泥坑，只好拆成零件，用牦牛驮回甘孜，以后，这条路线就再也没有人过问了。
    中华人民共和国建国五年来，不但把蒋匪帮溃败时严重破坏的公路修复起来，并且进行了和进行着康藏、青藏、昆洛、成阿、甘青等公路的新建和改建工程。一九五三年公路通车的里程就比一九五零年增加了百分之三十三，汽车经过大力整修和增添，一九五三年国营汽车比一九五零年增加了百分之一百一十五，汽车营业里程比一九五零年增加了百分之六十九，运输量比一九五零年增加了百分之三百五十六。
    新建的公路，多在少数民族地区和山岳地带。这些地方过去很多都是人烟绝迹的原始森林和边沿地域，工程异常艰巨。筑路的军工、民工和广大群众。在党和政府的号召下，克服种种困难，和大自然进行搏斗。他们经常在白雪纷纷的高原、草地，在零下二三十度、寒风凛冽、空气稀薄的高山上，铲开白雪，挖掉泥土，用绳子挂在腰间，在无法立脚的悬崖绝壁上，打眼炸方。恶劣的环境，艰苦的工作，不能阻挡他们建设公路的决心，“山高不如我们的脚板高，石坚不如我们的意志坚”，这种高度爱国主义的劳动热情和顽强的斗争意志，使我国公路建设迅速推进到新的地区。
    汽车运输工人一直在为提高劳动生产率而努力。一九五三年汽车运输业劳动生产率比一九五二年提高了百分之五十。运输成本、运价，相应地减低了，一九五三年汽车的液体客运运价比一九五一年降低了百分之三十三点六一，液体货运运价比一九五一年减低了百分之三十五点二一。
    公路运输事业的发展，对沿线工农业生产的发展和人民生活的改善，起了一定的作用，特别是少数民族地区的公路建设，促进了各少数民族的政治、经济和文化事业的发展。各族人民的生活日趋安定了，新的城镇出现了。历来无法外运的土产品逐渐运到外地了，从来少见的工业品在这些少数民族地区出现了，并且不断增加了。昆洛公路通车到车里后的第一个月，运到西双版纳傣族自治区的物资比通车前增加四倍多，一个月内运入的食盐就接近一九五三年半年的销售量。这些生动的事实，使少数民族亲身体会到毛主席民族政策的伟大，感到祖国民族大家庭的温暖。他们以极大的热情来支援公路建设。在康藏公路上，藏族人民组织了成千上万的牦牛，日夜翻山越岭，支援工程的进展。在青藏公路上，藏族人民早晨从二十里以外背着新鲜牛奶和酥油，送到工地。在成阿公路上，各族人民组织了舞蹈队，到工地举行慰问演出，沿线寺院的喇嘛也向筑路工人敬献哈达。
    在实现祖国社会主义工业化的伟大事业中，公路建筑和公路运输任务日趋繁重，全体公路运输工人正为这个伟大的任务而奋斗。（附图片）
