    Chairman of the German Social Democratic Party Comments on French Parliament's Rejection of "European Army" Treaty
    Advocates Holding Four-Power Conference to Discuss European Security and Other Issues
    [Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 1] Erich Ollenhauer, Chairman of the German Social Democratic Party, commented on August 30 on the French National Assembly's rejection of the "European Defence Community" treaty.
    Ollenhauer said: "The European Defence Community is dead. Since the French National Assembly has rejected the European Defence Community treaty in a democratic manner, no further attempts should be made to revive the treaty in any way." He also said: "The foreign policy adopted by Chancellor Adenauer and the West German Federal Government, which was based almost entirely on the European Defence Community treaty, has failed."
    Ollenhauer called for another four-power conference to discuss European security and the reunification of Germany. He also called on all countries in West Germany and Western Europe to "make every effort in good faith" to begin working towards a truly European policy.

    德国社会民主党主席就法议会拒绝“欧洲军”条约发表评论
    主张举行四国会议讨论欧洲安全等问题
    【新华社柏林一日电】德国社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔八月三十日就法国国民议会拒绝“欧洲防务集团”条约一事发表评论。
    奥伦豪尔说：“欧洲防务集团已经寿终正寝。既然法国国民议会以民主的方式拒绝了欧洲防务集团条约，那就不应当再作任何尝试来使这个条约以任何方式复活了。”他并且说：“阿登纳总理和西德联邦政府所采取的几乎完全以欧洲防务集团条约为基础的外交政策已经失败。”
    奥伦豪尔要求再召开一次四国会议，讨论欧洲安全和重新统一德国的问题。他并号召西德和西欧所有的国家“抱着诚意尽一切努力”来开始为一种真正欧洲的政策而努力。
