As with previous inspections conducted by the NNSC, the Korean-Chinese side provided full convenience and cooperation for the inspections from the 16th to the 18th. The liaison officers' office of the Korean-Chinese forces stationed at the Sinuiju port notified the NNSC in advance of the arrival time, number of people, and classified figures of weapons and ammunition carried out of the country for each batch of military personnel withdrawing from Korea over the past three days. Tents were set up inside the station for NNSC personnel to rest, and lighting equipment was installed on the platform for night inspections.

On the 16th, a total of 5,400 CPV military personnel withdrew from Korea. At 5:50 AM on the 16th, the first train carrying the CPV returning home entered Sinuiju Station, and a full inspection was conducted by the four NNSC members.

At 6:30 AM, the executive chairman, the Swedish member, announced the end of the inspection of the train.

    中立国视察小组
    视察志愿军返国部队
    【新华社新义州十九日电】中国人民志愿军返国部队自十六日起开始从朝鲜停战协定规定的后方口岸新义州撤出。驻在新义州的中立国视察小组在十六日、十七日、十八日对撤出朝鲜的一万四千九百七十六名中国人民志愿军军事人员及其携带的武器弹药进行了视察。
    正如中立国视察小组历次进行视察时一样，朝中方面对十六至十八日的视察也给予了充分的便利与合作。朝中部队驻新义州口岸联络军官办事处三天来对每批撤出朝鲜的军事人员的到达时间、人数及携带出境的武器弹药的分类数字都事先通知中立国视察小组。在车站内设立了供中立国人员休息的帐篷，月台上装设了供夜间视察的照明设备。
    十六日撤出朝鲜的中国人民志愿军军事人员共五千四百人。十六日清晨五时五十分，载运中国人民志愿军返国部队的第一列车进入新义州车站，由中立国视察小组四中立国组员进行了全组视察。接着由当日担任执行主席的瑞典组员和波兰组员组成的分组视察了第一节至第十节车厢，由瑞士组员和捷克斯洛伐克组员组成的分组视察了第十一节至二十节车厢，并抽查了第十一节车厢内军事人员携带的武器弹药。视察历时共约四十分钟。中立国人员在视察中及互相核对数字时都没有提出任何数字不符的情况。六时三十分执行主席瑞典组员宣布对这一列车的视察结束。中立国视察小组在目送列车驶过朝中国境上的鸭绿江铁桥后才离开车站。
    从第二次列车起，由瑞典组员和波兰组员组成的分组进行视察，他们在每次列车上都充分视察了出境的军事人员，并抽查了各次列车上出境的军事人员携带的武器弹药。视察工作直到深夜结束。
    十七日撤出朝鲜的中国人民志愿军军事人员六千一百五十六人，分乘九列火车到达新义州车站，由担任执行主席的瑞士组员和捷克斯洛伐克组员组成的分组进行视察。分组人员清查了每一节车厢里的军事人员并抽查了他们携带的武器弹药。
    十八日，由瑞典组员和波兰组员组成的分组视察了当天撤出朝鲜的中国人民志愿军军事人员三千四百二十人，并像前两天一样地清查了全部出境的军事人员，抽查了武器弹药。
    三天的视察工作进行得很顺利，中立国人员没有对视察提出意见或问题，也没有因为数字不符进行过复查。
