    Correctly Carry Out the Technical Innovation Movement

    Since May of this year, many industrial and mining enterprises across the country, following the decision of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and under the unified leadership of Party organizations at all levels, have launched a technical innovation movement. Technical innovation is a general slogan for improving technology and upgrading techniques. The content of the technical innovation movement is very broad, including improvements to machinery and equipment, production tools, technical processes, technical standards, operating methods, and working conditions. In some regions and industrial sectors, this movement has gradually formed a fairly widespread mass movement. According to incomplete statistics, there were 222 relatively important technical innovations in the second quarter, involving 31 departments, including machinery, metallurgy, construction, railways, coal mining, and textiles. This fact fully demonstrates that China's working class is striving to complete and overfulfill the country's first Five-Year Plan with boundless wisdom and creative labor.
    The technical innovation movement is linked to the improvement of enterprise management, greatly promoting the increase of labor productivity in enterprises. For example, after the staff and workers of the Shenyang Smelter created and adopted the advanced high-acid continuous operation method, they could complete two years' production tasks within a year according to the original quota. In enterprises where the movement has been carried out well, the key problems that have long hindered production have been solved by timely organizing and implementing rationalization proposals and technical reforms urgently needed for current production, thus smoothly completing or overfulfilling the state plan. This movement has increased national accumulation and greatly reduced product costs. For example, after worker Wang Yongfu and others of Tianjin Steel Plant created an automatic steel tilting trough, the annual profit can be increased by 3.5 billion yuan. After Shanghai Li Hua Paper Mill adopted alternative raw materials, the annual cost can be reduced by 12 billion yuan. After making possible improvements to some older factory equipment and manual operation procedures on the basis of existing technology, the workers' working conditions have also been improved to a certain extent.
    The policy of launching a mass technical innovation movement in industrial and mining enterprises is correct, and the effect is significant; however, it must be pointed out that some enterprises have experienced or are experiencing some deviations in the process of carrying out the movement, and some deviations are prominent. If these are not corrected in time, it will not only fail to achieve the goal of improving production and accelerating construction, but also affect the completion of the state plan.
    The deviations are mainly manifested in: some enterprises blindly and isolatedly pursue inventions and creations, decoupling the technical innovation movement from practical requirements and weakening its mass character. The specific manifestations of this deviation are:
    First, it deviates from the existing technical foundation and technical conditions of the enterprise, and blindly carries out technical reforms. For example, some textile factories, on the basis of outdated technical equipment, want to transform into a set of automated equipment for spinning, weaving, printing, and dyeing all at once. Some enterprises have not yet established a set of technical operating discipline, technical order, or technical standards, and technical management is still in a chaotic spontaneous state. The existing technical foundation is not yet consolidated, especially without mastering and implementing the Soviet Union's advanced technical experience. It is obviously inappropriate for such enterprises to pursue inventions and creations that are not practical.
    Second, due to the blindness and spontaneity of some enterprises in technical innovation, they often deviate from the current production needs of the enterprise. There are many suggestions for inventions and creations, but they are of no benefit to improving current production, and even weaken production due to the dispersion of workers' energy. This is a tendency of aimless drift.
    Third, because some enterprises only focus on the invention and creation of equipment and tools, they have relaxed the promotion of advanced experience that has already been effective in the past. This kind of more complex technical reform can only be participated in by workers with higher technical skills, resulting in the separation from the majority of workers who only have general technical skills, which weakens the mass character of the labor competition.
    Because some enterprises have the above-mentioned deviations to varying degrees, the labor productivity and product quality of some factories have declined after carrying out the technical innovation movement, and even disrupted the normal production order and damaged the enthusiasm of the workers. The main reason for the above situation is the lack of correct, unified, and specific leadership.
    In order to correct the deviations that have already occurred and enable the technical innovation movement to develop correctly and healthily, the staff and workers of each enterprise, especially the leading cadres of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League at all levels, must have a unified and clear understanding of the technical innovation movement.
    We must correctly understand the current production requirements and technical conditions of each enterprise, and determine the content, focus, and methods of technical innovation based on actual needs and existing foundations.
    The production of China's existing industrial and mining enterprises is different, and the technical level is also different, so they have different requirements for technical reform and improvement. Therefore, the content and focus of technical innovation in each enterprise, and even each workshop, should be different according to different circumstances. From the perspective of production requirements, if the central task of production in some factories is to improve quality, the central requirement for technical innovation in the factory is to improve and consolidate quality; if the production cost of some factories is high and the quota of raw material consumption is high, the center of technical innovation in such factories should be to mobilize staff and workers to find ways to reduce costs and lower consumption quotas. In terms of technical level, in places where equipment is very backward and manual operations are used, technical innovation can focus on improving equipment and tools. In newly built enterprises with a high degree of mechanization, especially those using Soviet equipment, the main task should be to learn to master the process operation regulations of these new machines and give full play to the efficiency of the new equipment, rather than engaging in "mechanization and automation" again. The operating procedures of some enterprises are unsound, unreasonable, and not unified. Sometimes there are dozens of operating methods for the same kind of work. In this kind of enterprise, the most advanced one should be selected or synthesized from the existing various operating methods, and everyone should be mobilized to learn it, and finally stipulated as a unified operating procedure and implemented. Some enterprises have begun to adopt the Soviet Union's advanced technical standards, and have stipulated relatively advanced operating procedures according to this standard, but these procedures have not been mastered by the staff and workers, and have not been well implemented. The staff and workers in these enterprises should first strictly abide by the operating procedures, overcome the difficulties in implementation, and ensure that the specified standards are met. In short, each enterprise should first establish and implement correct and unified operating procedures, and then carry out reforms and improvements on this basis.
    No matter what kind of enterprise, the promotion of advanced experience, especially the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and the important advanced experience that has been effective in the country, should be taken as an important content of technical innovation. Because advanced experience is already the result of technical innovation, and the promotion of advanced experience has the broadest mass base, it can mobilize and organize all the staff and workers in the enterprise, so as not to limit the movement to only a few advanced people. It should be recognized that if the staff and workers are not led to learn and master the technically mature advanced experience to improve the level of production technology, but instead they are required to blindly explore the "inventions and creations" that others have already succeeded in, this will lead the technical innovation movement to the wrong path.
  (Of course, in the important links where there is no ready-made advanced experience, it is still necessary to rely on the staff and workers to carry out new creations and reforms.) In addition, in view of the backward industrial foundation of our country, generally speaking, the technical level of workers is not high enough. Especially in recent years, the large increase in new workers in enterprises has made the situation of workers' technical level not keeping up with production requirements even more prominent. Therefore, strengthening workers' learning of cultural, technical, and basic scientific knowledge is an indispensable condition for carrying out the technical innovation movement persistently and widely. Therefore, this work cannot be ignored.
    When carrying out the technical innovation movement, the purpose of the movement must be clarified.
    The purpose of technical innovation is to continuously improve labor productivity, so as to ensure the comprehensive completion and strive to overfulfill the state plan. Therefore, technical innovation must strictly proceed from the characteristics of the enterprise and the current specific requirements, and must never be carried out blindly and aimlessly. From the perspective of the common tasks of general enterprises at present, the specific goals of technical innovation should mainly focus on three aspects, namely: First, improve the quality of existing products and strengthen the manufacturing of new products. This is the central task of existing production enterprises in terms of technology during the period of large-scale national construction. If we cannot do this, the national construction plan cannot be completed. Any technical innovation, if it deviates from this point, and manufactures only old, low-quality, and unsalable products, then no matter how many times the efficiency is improved, the result can only be that the more production increases, the greater the waste. Second, focus on the weak links in the enterprise, so that technical innovation can achieve the goal of balanced production. This will enable the results of technical innovation to be manifested in the improvement of the entire enterprise's production. Otherwise, if technical innovation is carried out blindly only in individual links, the result may cause greater imbalances in production and disconnections between processes, which will not only fail to realize the due role of technical innovation, but also cause confusion in production. Third, technical innovation must achieve the purpose of economic accounting. That is, to reduce the consumption of raw materials, reduce the scrap rate, improve labor organization, and save manpower. At the same time, when carrying out technical innovation, methods that require less investment (or no investment) and have great results should be selected as much as possible, and the focus should not be placed on increasing and modifying large-scale equipment.
    The technical innovation movement must have correct, unified, and specific leadership.
    Correct leadership is to formulate a technical measures plan for the enterprise based on the current technical foundation and specific production requirements, and lead the masses to carry out technical innovation purposefully and systematically. Unified leadership is that the administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, should make unified arrangements and arrangements for this movement based on the technical requirements put forward by the administration, with specific divisions of labor, and should not think that this is only the trade union's business. On this issue, two deviations must be opposed. One is not studying the current needs of the enterprise, proposing appropriate technical innovation topics, and organizing and leading the masses to give play to their enthusiasm and creativity; but simply calling on the masses to put forward a large number of rationalization proposals, regardless of what kind of proposals are put forward, whether they are reasonable or not, they are all supported, adopted, and even allowed to occupy working hours, with the enterprise providing money, materials, and sending technical personnel to help research those technical innovation proposals that cannot solve the key problems in the enterprise at present. This approach is incorrect. A large part of the current spontaneous tendency in the movement is generated from here. The other deviation is that some comrades oppose improving enterprise technical management and the technical innovation movement. They believe that the central work of the enterprise at present is to establish a responsibility system and strengthen planning management. Therefore, they adopt a laissez-faire attitude towards the technical innovation movement, and as a result, they abandon leadership. They do not understand that if we do not rely on the vast masses to continuously carry out technical reforms, it is impossible to ensure balanced production and realize advanced operation plans. Therefore, the reform of enterprise management and the mass technical innovation movement are complementary to each other, and neither aspect can be lacking. Those who negate and ignore technical innovation are one-sided in their thinking, lack mass viewpoints, and are accustomed to working alone in their work methods, and are not good at combining leadership with the masses. If these are not corrected, it will be difficult to truly improve enterprise management and complete the national production and construction plan.
    The technical innovation movement must be carried out soundly on the basis of mass labor competition.
    We must clearly recognize that technical innovation is only a main content of labor competition, not the only content. The specific methods adopted by millions of workers in the labor competition launched to complete the national plan are diverse. This includes learning advanced working methods, making rationalization proposals, also including diligent and intense labor to complete each shift's work plan, including saving every bit of material use, and including strict compliance with labor discipline. Lenin once pointed out that the greatest feature of socialist labor competition, the fundamental principle of competition, lies in its mass character and collectivist spirit. Therefore, we must never replace the rich and diverse content of labor competition with technical innovation, especially with inventions and creations. Otherwise, not only will labor competition not be able to move forward, but it will also curb the enthusiasm of the vast masses.
    We believe that if the Party committees, administrations, trade unions, and Communist Youth Leagues in each enterprise, each industrial leading department, and Party committees and trade unions at all levels strengthen their leadership over the technical innovation movement and correct deviations in accordance with the above-mentioned principles, the technical innovation movement will definitely develop further and vigorously, and play a greater role in the great cause of national industrialization.

    正确地开展技术革新运动
    全国各地的许多工矿企业，自今年五月以来，依照中华全国总工会的决定，在各级党组织的统一领导下，开展了技术革新运动。技术革新是提高技术、改善技术的一个总口号。技术革新运动的内容是很宽广的，它包括对于机器设备、生产工具、技术过程、技术标准、操作方法和劳动条件等方面的改进。这个运动在某些地区和工业部门中，已逐渐形成一个相当广泛的群众性运动。根据不完全的统计，在第二季度中出现的比较重要的技术革新有二百二十二件，涉及的产业有机械、冶金、建筑、铁路、煤矿、纺织等三十一个部门。这个事实充分说明我国工人阶级正以无穷的智慧和创造性的劳动，为完成和超额完成国家的第一个五年计划而奋斗。
    技术革新运动和企业管理工作的提高相联系，大大地推动了企业中的劳动生产率的提高，如沈阳冶炼厂职工创造和采用了先进的高酸连续操作法后，按原来的定额，一年可完成两年的生产任务。在运动开展较好的企业中，由于及时组织和实现了当前生产迫切需要的合理化建议和技术改革，长期阻碍生产的关键问题得到解决，顺利完成或超额完成了国家计划。这个运动使国家积累增加，产品成本大大降低，如天津钢厂工人王永福等创造了自动翻钢槽后，全年可增加利润三十五亿元。上海利华造纸厂采用代替原料后，每年可降低成本一百二十亿元。某些设备较旧的工厂和手工操作的程序，在现有的技术基础上加以可能的改进以后，工人的劳动条件也得到了一定的改善。
    在工矿企业中开展群众性的技术革新运动的方针是正确的，效果也是显著的；但是，必须指出，有些企业在运动开展的过程中，已经发生或正在发生一些偏向，有些偏向是突出的，如不及时纠正，不仅不能达到提高生产加快建设速度的目的，而且会影响国家计划的完成。
    偏向主要表现在：有些企业盲目地孤立地追求发明创造，使技术革新运动和现实要求脱节，削弱了它的群众性。这个偏向的具体表现是：
    第一、脱离了企业现有的技术基础和技术条件，盲目进行技术改革。如有的纺织厂，在陈旧的技术设备的基础上，想一下改造成为纺、织、印染一套自动化的设备。有的企业，至今还没有建立起一套技术操作纪律、技术秩序、技术标准，技术管理还处于混乱的自发状态中，已有的技术基础还不巩固，特别是没有掌握和贯彻苏联的先进技术经验，这样的企业也要追逐不切实际需要的发明创造，这显然是不恰当的。
    第二、由于某些企业在技术革新中存在盲目性和自发性，因而常常脱离企业当前的生产需要，发明创造建议很多，但对提高当前生产并无裨益，甚至因为工人精力分散而削弱了生产，这是一种无目标的自流倾向。
    第三、因为有的企业只是单纯追求设备、工具的发明创造，放松了过去已有成效的先进经验的推广，而这种比较复杂的技术改革，又只能是技术较高的工人才能参加，结果脱离了多数只有一般技术的工人群众，也就削弱了劳动竞赛的群众性。
    正因有些企业在不同程度上存在上面所说的偏向，结果有的工厂在开展技术革新运动以后，劳动生产率和产品质量反而下降了，甚至破坏了正常的生产秩序，损伤了工人群众的积极性。产生上述情况的主要原因是缺乏正确的、统一的、具体的领导。
    为了纠正目前已经发生的偏向，使技术革新运动得到正确的健康的发展，各个企业的职工，特别是党、行政、工会、青年团的各级领导干部，对技术革新运动必须取得统一的明确的认识。
    我们必须正确地认识各个企业目前的生产要求和技术状况，从实际需要和现有基础出发，来确定技术革新的内容、重点和作法。
    我国现有工矿企业的生产不同，技术水平也不同，它们对于技术的改革和提高就有不同的要求。因此，各个企业，乃至各个车间的技术革新的内容、重点，都应根据不同情况而有所区别。从生产的要求上说，如有的工厂生产的中心任务在于提高质量，对该厂技术革新的中心要求就在于提高和巩固质量；有的工厂的生产成本高、原材料消耗定额高，这样的厂的技术革新的中心就在于动员职工大家想办法来减低成本，降低消耗定额。从技术水平来说，如在那些设备很落后和使用手工操作的地方，技术革新就可以着重在改进设备和工具方面。在机械化程度很高，特别是使用苏联设备的新建企业中，主要任务就应该是学会掌握这些新机器的工艺操作规程，充分发挥新设备的效能，而不是再搞“机械化、自动化”。有些企业的操作规程不健全，不合理，而且不统一、有时同一种工作就有几十种操作方法。在这种企业里，就应该首先从现有的各种操作方法中选择或综合出最先进的一种，发动大家都来学习，最后规定为统一的操作规程，加以贯彻。有的企业已开始采用了苏联先进的技术标准，并按此标准规定了比较先进的操作规程，但是这些规程还没有被职工所掌握，没有很好贯彻。这些企业中的职工就应该首先严格遵守操作规程，克服执行中的困难，保证达到规定的标准。总之，各个企业都应该首先建立和贯彻正确的统一的操作规程，然后再在这个基础上进行改革和提高。
    不管那一种企业，都应该以推广先进经验，特别是苏联的先进经验和国内行之有效的重要先进经验，作为技术革新的重要内容。因为先进经验已经是技术革新的成果，而推广先进经验有最广泛的群众基础，它可以动员和组织企业中所有的职工，而不致于把运动仅仅限在少数的先进人物中间。应该认识，如果不领导职工好好地去学习和掌握技术上已成熟的先进经验，来提高生产技术水平，反而要职工盲目摸索地去进行别人已经成功的“发明创造”，这就会把技术革新运动引导到错误的道路。
  （当然，在没有现成的先进经验的重要环节上，仍然需要依靠职工进行新的创造和改革。）此外，鉴于我国原来工业基础落后，就总的说来，工人的技术水平是不够高的。特别是近年来企业中新工人大量增加，工人技术水平赶不上生产要求的情况更加突出。因此，加强工人的文化、技术及基本科学知识的学习，是持久地广泛地开展技术革新运动的不可缺少的条件。因而这项工作也是不能忽视的。
    在开展技术革新运动的时候，必须明确运动的目的。
    技术革新的目的就是要不断提高劳动生产率，来保证全面完成和争取超额完成国家计划。因此，技术革新必须严格地从本企业的特点和当前的具体要求出发，绝不能盲无目标自流进行。从目前一般企业的共同任务来看，技术革新的具体目标主要应该集中在三个方面，即：第一，提高现有产品的质量，加强新产品的制造工作。这是国家大规模建设时期现有生产企业在技术方面的中心任务。如果我们不能做到这一点，国家的建设计划就不能完成。任何技术上的革新，如果离开了这一点，制造的只是陈旧的、质量低下的、没有销路的产品，那么，不管效率提高多少倍，结果只能是增产越多，浪费越大。第二，针对本企业中的薄弱环节，使技术革新能达到均衡生产的目的。这样就能够使技术革新的成果表现为整个企业生产的提高。否则，如果只在各个个别的环节上盲目地进行技术革新，其结果可能造成生产中更大的不平衡和工序间的脱节，不但不能实现技术革新应有的作用，反而造成生产的混乱。第三，要使技术革新达到经济核算的目的。即做到原材料的消耗减少，废品率降低，劳动组织改善，人力得到节省。同时，在进行技术革新的时候，还应该尽可能选择那些投资少（或不需要投资）收效大的方法，而不要把重点放在增加和改装大型的设备方面。
    技术革新运动必须有正确的统一的具体的领导。
    正确的领导就是要根据企业目前的技术基础和生产上的具体要求，制定本企业的技术措施计划，有目的有计划地领导群众进行技术革新。统一的领导就是行政、工会、青年团要在党委的统一领导下，根据行政上所提出的技术要求，对这个运动作统一的布置和安排，有具体的分工，而不能认为这只是工会的事情。在这个问题上，要反对两种偏向。一种是不研究企业当前需要，提出恰当的技术革新课题，有组织有领导地发挥群众的积极性和创造精神；而是单纯号召群众大量提合理化建议，不论提出何种建议，是否合理，都一律支持、采纳、甚至允许占用工作时间，由企业出钱、出材料，派技术人员去帮助研究那些不能解决目前企业中关键问题的技术革新建议。这种做法是不正确的，目前运动中的盲目自发倾向，很大一部分就是从这里产生的。另外一种偏向是有些同志把改进企业技术管理和技术革新运动对立起来，他们认为目前企业的中心工作是建立责任制和加强计划管理，因此他们就对技术革新运动采取了放任自流态度，结果是放弃了领导。他们不了解，如果不依靠广大群众不断地从技术上进行改革，要保证生产均衡，实现先进的作业计划，是不可能的。所以，企业管理的改革和群众性的技术革新运动是相辅相成的，那一方面也不能缺少的。那些否定和忽视技术革新的人，在思想上有片面性，缺乏群众观点，在工作方法上习惯于单打一，不善于把领导与群众结合起来。如果对这些不加以纠正，要想真正改善企业管理，完成国家生产建设计划是困难的。
    技术革新运动，必须建立在群众性的劳动竞赛的基础上，才能健全地开展起来。
    我们必须明确认识，技术革新只是劳动竞赛的一个主要内容，而不是唯一的内容。千百万的工人群众在为完成国家计划而掀起的劳动竞赛中，所采用的具体方法是多种多样的。这里包括学习先进的工作方法，提合理化建议，也包括为完成每一班的作业计划而进行勤恳紧张的劳动，包括在材料使用上一点一滴的节约，包括对劳动纪律的严格遵守。列宁曾经指出过，社会主义劳动竞赛的最大特点，竞赛的根本原则，在于它的群众性和集体主义精神。因此，我们决不能以技术革新，尤其是以发明创造来代替劳动竞赛的多方面的丰富内容。否则，不仅劳动竞赛不能向前推进一步，而且会遏制广大群众的积极性。
    我们相信，如果各个企业中的党委、行政、工会、青年团，各个工业领导部门，各级地方党委和工会根据上述的几个原则来加强对技术革新运动的领导，纠正偏差，技术革新运动就一定能够进一步蓬勃地开展起来，在国家工业化的伟大事业中发挥更大的作用。
