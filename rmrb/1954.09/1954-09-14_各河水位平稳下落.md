Xinhua News Agency: Recently, rainfall has been scarce, and the water levels of various rivers are steadily falling. The water level of the Yangtze River is continuing to fall from Yichang and downstream. The water level at Hankou has fallen below the highest historical water level of 28.28 meters. At 2:00 PM on the 13th, it was 28.26 meters and is continuing to fall. The water levels at the upper and middle reaches of the Huai River have receded below the warning level. The Yellow River experienced four consecutive flood peaks in late August and early September. The ninth flood peak reached Qinchang on September 5th, and the flood peak had passed Lijin, Shandong Province on the 10th; thanks to strict defense, no major accidents occurred along the river. Since the beginning of September, the water situation in various rivers in Northeast China has stabilized. The water situation of the Ziya River and the South Canal in the North China region had developed, but it has now begun to recede.
