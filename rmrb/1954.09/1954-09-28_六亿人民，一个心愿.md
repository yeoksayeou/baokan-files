    Six Hundred Million People, One Wish
    By our reporter Tian Liu
    On the 27th, the First Session of the First National People's Congress entered its fourth item on the agenda: to elect the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the People's Republic of China, and other leading personnel of state organs.
    How eagerly people awaited the arrival of this moment! When Delegate Wu Chun'an first arrived in Beijing, he repeatedly told people what Wang Bingxiang, a sixty-year-old feeder in their agricultural production cooperative, had told him. Wang Bingxiang said: "I have no other instruction, you must elect Chairman Mao for me. He rescued me from suffering and gave me the happy life I have today." This is not just Wang Bingxiang's wish, it is the wish of five hundred million peasants, the wish of six hundred million people across the country. An elderly Miao man from Guizhou, 120 years old, tearfully said to his delegate, Ou Baichuan: "Chairman Mao is the father of the Miao people, he cares about us in everything." He told Delegate Ou Baichuan to be sure to elect Chairman Mao. This is not just the wish of that elderly Miao man, it is the wish of the entire Miao people, the common wish of all ethnic groups across the country.
    This solemn and happy moment finally arrived.
    On this day, more delegates attended than usual, and they arrived especially early. Everyone couldn't suppress the joy in their hearts, and every face was filled with smiles.
    Twenty-one-year-old female delegate Chen Shulan sat happily in her seat, repeatedly drawing circles on a clean white piece of paper. She wanted to draw the most round and beautiful circle around the name of the person she loved the most. Delegate Zhao Maochen's chest was covered with dazzling medals. He was a delegate elected by the Chinese People's Volunteers. On the Korean battlefield, he used victorious battles to defend the security of the motherland and the happiness of the people. Now, in the meeting hall of the National People's Congress, he would use the highest power the people had given him to fulfill the Volunteers' entrustment to him, to realize the hopes of the people across the country. Yang Daiti, a Yi woman delegate from Sichuan Province, specially wore her beautiful national costume for the festival, her eyes revealing irrepressible enthusiasm, gazing at the rostrum, gazing at the bright and splendid national emblem hanging high. She was recalling the entrustment of the Yi elders to her: "Elect Chairman Mao as our guide."
    Executive Chairman Liu Shaoqi announced: According to the joint nomination of one hundred and nine delegates, when Comrade Mao Zedong and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Zhu De were nominated as candidates for Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the People's Republic of China, warm applause erupted from the audience.
    "Are there any other nominations?" Comrade Liu Shaoqi asked for the delegates' opinions. There was not a sound in the hall. After a pause, Comrade Liu Shaoqi asked again: "Are there any other nominations?" All the delegates welcomed this nomination with thunderous applause. Then, Comrade Liu Shaoqi solemnly announced the election instructions: You can vote for yourself; if you do not agree with the people nominated on the ballot, you can vote for someone else you think is appropriate.
    Who would disagree? They were precisely the people that everyone sincerely wanted to elect.
    Like all the worker delegates, Ma Liuhaizi supported the Communist Party and elected Chairman Mao. Because Ma Liuhaizi deeply knew how his life had turned from bitterness to sweetness. His grandfather and father were both coal miners, and both died in poverty and hunger. He himself started working as a miner when he was just over ten years old. In order to survive, his son, at the age of nine, had no choice but to go down the mine to dig coal like his three generations of ancestors. After liberation, Ma Liuhaizi moved from a cave on the hillside into a spacious and bright staff dormitory. His son was sent to elementary school, and his salary increased. Since 1951, he has also gone to the seaside miners' sanatorium for recuperation every year. Ma Liuhaizi knew how this life had changed, so he worked especially actively. His tunneling team continuously created new tunneling records, greatly promoting the motherland's coal mining industry. In the new China, labor is a glorious thing, and the state is very concerned about Ma Liuhaizi's creative labor, and has now sent him to a miners' quick-study middle school to study and improve himself. At this moment, Ma Liuhaizi solemnly wrote his wish on that sacred ballot. Zhang Mingshan, Wang Chonglun and other worker delegates all wanted to elect Comrade Mao Zedong, because he led the people of the whole country to realize the working class's long-cherished wish, establishing a people's democratic state led by the working class on our land, and is advancing towards a prosperous and happy socialism at a victorious pace.
    Delegate Li Shunda, this simple and honest peasant from the Taihang Mountains, supported the Communist Party and elected Chairman Mao. He knew how he had changed from a poor peasant who had no food to eat into a peasant who was well-fed and clothed. He knew how his hometown had changed from a poor and remote place with high mountains, large rocks, deep gullies and thin soil into a happy and prosperous village with four elementary schools, six private schools, a medical clinic, a midwifery station, telephones, and radios. He knew how a peasant who didn't even dare to enter the gate of the township government had become the director of an agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperative, and now became a delegate to the National People's Congress, sitting in this solemn people's palace deciding the fate of the country and the happiness of the people. He knew all of this. During the discussion of the constitution, he told all the delegates and the people of the whole country the wishes of the broad masses of peasants: "The constitution consolidates these revolutionary achievements, which not only guarantees that we will no longer suffer, but also guarantees that we will become more and more happy." Now, he wrote his wish, the wish of five hundred million peasants, on that solemn ballot, on the name of that great man who helped the peasants break free from the feudal shackles that had bound them for thousands of years, enabling every peasant to obtain land, and leading the peasants onto the socialist road of universal prosperity – Comrade Mao Zedong.
    In order to forever bury national oppression and discrimination, for the increasing prosperity and happiness of all ethnic groups, for the beautiful life of equality, mutual assistance, friendship and warmth in the national family that has been obtained and is growing day by day, the representatives of minority nationalities also unanimously elected Comrade Mao Zedong. Delegates the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni wrote the wishes of the Tibetan people on the ballot, on the name of Chairman Mao. Tibet, a place that had been oppressed and ravaged by imperialism and domestic reactionary rulers, is now singing happy and free songs. Tibet has returned to the embrace of the motherland, and the Tibetan people, like all ethnic groups, are living freely in the united and friendly family of the motherland. Tibet is no longer a remote frontier. The Kangzang Highway directly to Lhasa will be built this year. Tibet is no longer a desolate place. With the help and care of the state, many primitive wastelands have been reclaimed into fertile fields. Tibet is no longer a place where diseases are prevalent and culture is backward. Hospitals and schools are being established one after another. Tibet is no longer a place where imperialists arbitrarily play tricks and create national discrimination and ethnic disputes. The Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni have successively solemnly declared to the world: "The Han and Tibetan nationalities are increasingly moving towards close unity. The return of Panchen Erdeni to Tibet to meet me has further strengthened the internal unity of Tibet." "We will always unite around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, together with the Dalai Lama, … to build a prosperous and happy new Tibet."
    Youth delegates elected Comrade Mao Zedong for the happy life they have already obtained and the brilliant future they are about to obtain; women delegates elected Comrade Mao Zedong for women's rights and the happiness of mothers and children; intellectual, artist, and scientist delegates elected Comrade Mao Zedong because he built a fertile garden for all scientific research and artistic creation work; because he opened up a vast world for everyone engaged in science, education, literature, and art.
    At 5:30, Comrade Liu Shaoqi announced the election results: of the 1,210 delegates present, Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Zhu De received 1,210 votes and were elected Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the People's Republic of China by a unanimous vote. Immediately, like a storm sweeping across the venue, warm applause and cheers shook the hall. A military delegate cheered "Long live Chairman Mao" through the microphone, Xinjiang Uygur delegates waved their hats and applauded, and Chen Shulan, the twenty-one-year-old female delegate from Chongqing, jumped on her chair to cheer and applaud because she was small. Everyone was happy, every heart was laughing, what great joy, what great happiness, applaud! Cheer! Dance! Outside, on the streets, in Tiananmen Square, and throughout the country, there was simultaneous rejoicing. At ten o'clock in the evening, after the radio broadcast the news that Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Chairman Mao Zedong's close comrade-in-arms, had been elected Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and that Comrade Zhou Enlai had been nominated by the Chairman and approved by the Congress as Premier of the State Council, the joyful crowds added new joy. People cheered, people sang, cheered "Long live Chairman Mao," and sang "Long live the Chinese Communist Party."
    September 27, 1954, was a happy day. On this day, the First Session of the First National People's Congress once again fulfilled the entrustment of the people of the whole country and perfectly expressed the wishes of six hundred million people.

    六亿人民，一个心愿
    本报记者　田流
    二十七日，第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议进入第四项议程，选举中华人民共和国主席、副主席及其他国家机关的领导工作人员。
    人们多么殷切地期待这一时刻的到来啊！吴春安代表刚到北京的时候，就一次又一次地向人说，他们农业生产合作社的一个社员，六十多岁的老饲养员王秉祥跟他说的话。王秉祥说：“我没有别的嘱托，你要给我选上毛主席，他把我从苦难中救出来，又给了我今天的幸福生活。”这不只是王秉祥的心愿，这是五万万农民的心愿，是全国六亿人民的心愿。贵州的一位一百二十岁苗族老人，激动地流着热泪向自己的代表欧百川说：“毛主席是苗家的父亲，什么事都关心我们。”他要欧百川代表一定要选举毛主席。这不只是那位高龄的苗族老人的心愿，是整个苗族的心愿，是全国各族人民的共同心愿。
    这一个庄严幸福的时刻终于来临了。
    这天，代表们出席的特别多，到的也特别早，每一个人都抑止不住内心的喜悦，每一个人脸上都洋溢着笑容。
    二十一岁的女代表陈树兰笑嘻嘻地坐在自己的席位上，一次又一次地用笔在一张洁白的纸头上画圈圈，她要在自己最敬爱的人的名字上画上一个最圆最美的圆圈。赵毛臣代表胸前挂满了灿烂夺目的勋章。他是中国人民志愿军选出的代表，在朝鲜战场上，他用胜利的战斗，保卫了祖国的安全，保卫了人民的幸福；现在，在全国人民代表大会的会议席上，他要用人民给他的最高权力，实现志愿军广大指战员对他的嘱托，实现全国人民的希望。四川省彝族女代表杨代蒂，特地穿上了节日的美丽的民族服装，眼睛里流露着抑止不住的热情，凝视着主席台，凝视着高高悬起的光辉灿烂的国徽，她在回忆，回忆彝族父老给自己的嘱托：“选毛主席当咱们的引路人”。
    执行主席刘少奇同志宣布：根据一百零九位代表的联合提名，毛泽东同志和他的亲密战友朱德同志为中华人民共和国主席、副主席候选人的时候，全场响起了热烈的掌声。
      “有没有别的提名？”刘少奇同志征询代表们的意见。全场没有一点声音。停了一阵，刘少奇同志又问：“有没有别的提名？”全体代表用暴风雨般的掌声表示欢迎这个提名。接着，刘少奇同志郑重宣布选举注意事项：自己可以选自己；如不同意选票上提名的人，可以另外选自己认为恰当的人。
    谁会不同意呢？他们正是大家衷心要选举的人啦。
    马六孩像所有的工人代表们一样，拥护共产党，选举毛主席。因为马六孩深深知道他的生活是怎样苦尽甜来的。他的祖父、父亲都是煤矿工人，都是在穷困和饥饿中死去的；他自己从十多岁就开始作矿工，为了活命，他的儿子在九岁的时候，也不得不像他的祖辈三代一样下井挖煤了。解放后，马六孩从山坡的土洞里搬入宽敞光亮的职工宿舍，儿子送入了小学读书，工资增加了还不算，从一九五一年起，还年年去海滨矿工疗养所休养。马六孩是知道这生活怎样变化的，因此，他劳动得特别积极，他的掘进组连续创造了掘进新纪录，极大地推动了祖国的采煤工业。在新中国，劳动是光荣的事情，国家对马六孩的创造性劳动十分关怀，现已把他送入矿工速成中学读书深造。此刻，马六孩庄严地把自己的心愿写在那张神圣的选票上。张明山、王崇伦和其他工人代表们，都要选举毛泽东同志，因为他领导全国人民实现了工人阶级的宿愿，在我们的国土上，建立起了以工人阶级为领导的人民民主国家，并正以胜利的步伐，向着繁荣幸福的社会主义前进。
    李顺达代表，这位来自太行山的淳朴农民，拥护共产党，选举毛主席。他知道自己怎样由一个没有饭吃的贫农变成丰衣足食的农民；他知道自己的家乡怎样由一个山高石大、沟深土薄的穷乡僻处，变成了有四所小学，六所民校，有医疗所、接生站，有电话机、收音机的快乐的富裕的村庄；他知道一个连乡公所大门也不敢入的农民，怎样变成了农林牧农业生产合作社的社长，现在又变成全国人民代表大会的代表，坐在这庄严的人民宫殿里决定着国家的命运、人民的幸福。他知道这一切。在讨论宪法时，他向全体代表也向全国人民说出了广大农民的心愿：“宪法把这些革命的成果都巩固起来了，这不但保证我们不再受罪，而且保证我们越来越幸福。”现在，他把自己的心愿，五万万农民的心愿，写进那张庄严的选票，写在那个帮助农民挣脱了几千年来捆绑在农民身上的封建锁链，使每一个农民都获得了土地，又领导农民走上普遍富裕的社会主义道路的伟大的人——毛泽东同志的名字上。
    为了永远埋葬民族压迫和歧视，为了各民族日益昌盛和幸福，为了已经获得并日益增长的民族大家庭中的平等互助友爱温暖的美好生活，少数民族的代表们也一致地选举毛泽东同志。达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼代表，把藏族人民的心愿写在选票上，写在毛主席的名字上。西藏，这个被帝国主义、国内反动统治者压迫和蹂躏过的地方，现在唱起了幸福的自由的歌声，西藏回到了祖国的怀抱，藏族人民也像各族人民一样，自由自在地生活在团结友爱的祖国大家庭中了。西藏再不是遥远的边疆，直达拉萨的康藏公路，今年就要修筑起来；西藏再不是荒凉的地方了，在国家的帮助和关怀下，许多原始荒原被开垦成了良田；西藏再不是疾病流行、文化落后的地方了，医院和学校一个接连一个地设立起来；西藏再不是帝国主义者任意玩弄阴谋，制造民族歧视、民族纠纷的地方了，达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼先后向世界庄严地宣告：“汉藏民族正在日益走向亲密团结之中。班禅额尔德尼能归返西藏和我相会，也进一步加强了西藏内部的团结。”“我们永远团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，同达赖喇嘛一起，……建设繁荣幸福的新西藏。”
    青年代表们为了他们已经获得的幸福生活和即将获得的灿烂前程，选举毛泽东同志；妇女代表为了妇女的权利和母亲儿童们的幸福，选举毛泽东同志；知识分子、艺术家、科学家代表，选举毛泽东同志，因为他给一切科学研究、艺术创作工作建筑起肥沃的园地；因为他给一切从事科学、教育、文学、艺术事业的人，开辟了广阔活动的天地。
    五点半钟，刘少奇同志宣布选举结果，出席代表一千二百一十名，毛泽东同志和朱德同志获得选票一千二百一十张，全票当选为中华人民共和国主席、副主席。顿时，像风暴卷过了会场，全场响起了热烈的掌声，欢呼声震动殿宇。一位部队代表用送话器欢呼着毛主席万岁，新疆维吾尔族代表挥舞着他们的帽子鼓掌，重庆市那位二十一岁的女代表陈树兰，因为个子小，跳到椅子上去欢呼去鼓掌。每一个人都在高兴，每一个心都在欢笑，多么大的快乐，多么大的幸福啊，鼓掌吧！欢呼吧！跳舞吧！在外面，在街道上，在天安门广场，在全国各地，同时欢腾起来了。夜晚十点钟，广播电台广播出毛泽东同志的亲密战友刘少奇同志当选为全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员长、周恩来同志由主席提名大会通过为国务院总理的消息传到各地后，欢乐的人群增加了新的欢乐。人们欢呼，人们歌唱，欢呼毛主席万岁，歌唱万岁啊中国共产党。
    一九五四年九月二十七日，是个幸福的日子。这一天第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，又一次地实现了全国人民的嘱托，完善地表现了六亿人民的心愿。
