    The Joy of Tobacco Farmers
    New tobacco from the Xuchang Special District of Henan Province has been on the market in large quantities since early August. Every day, one to two thousand farmers come to the market to sell tobacco leaves. The state-owned Tobacco and Hemp Company and cooperatives purchase more than 120,000 jin of tobacco leaves daily. This year, the People's Government has appropriately increased the purchase price according to the Qinghuang four-level new tobacco grade, increasing the price per jin of tobacco leaves by 150 yuan compared to last year, and 300 yuan compared to the year before.
    The tobacco farmers use a small portion of the money earned from selling tobacco leaves to buy daily necessities, and most of the money is used to buy fertilizers and pesticides, striving for a comprehensive bumper harvest of tobacco leaves. In the market, the farmers hold the industrial products they bought, each filled with joy. Du Lao'er, who had worked as a hired hand for landlords for more than ten years, said: "Life is getting better and better now. I wore homespun cloth last year, but this year I bought fine cloth; I used a small donkey last year, but this year I want to get a big mule. I'm even using waterwheels and new-style walking plows."

    烟农们的喜悦
    从八月上旬开始，河南省许昌专区新烟已经大量上市。每天有一两千个农民到市上出卖烟叶。国营烟麻公司、合作社每天收购的烟叶达十二万多斤。人民政府今年又按青黄四级新烟等级，适当提高了收购价格，每斤烟叶比去年提高一百五十元；比前年提高三百元。
    烟农们把卖烟叶所得的钱用一小部分购买生活用品，大部分钱都用来购买肥料和杀虫药剂，争取烟叶全面丰收。在市场上，农民们拿着买到的工业品，个个欢欣喜悦。给地主扛过十几年活的杜老二说：“如今的日子越过越强。我去年穿土布，今年买了细布；去年使小毛驴，今年要换个大骡子。还使上了水车和新式步犁。”  （何朝宗）
