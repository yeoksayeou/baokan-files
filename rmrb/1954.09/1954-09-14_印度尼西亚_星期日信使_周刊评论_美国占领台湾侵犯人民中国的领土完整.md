Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 12th - The newly published "Sunday Courier" weekly published an article commenting on the justness of the Chinese people liberating Taiwan.

The article said that everyone knows that Taiwan is China's legitimate territory, and no one doubts this fact. Since Chiang Kai-shek's defeat - actually a defeat for the United States - the United States has spared no effort to shelter the exiled Chiang Kai-shek, hoping to salvage their failure on the Chinese mainland. The United States' occupation of Taiwan in June 1950 was illegal. Since then, the United States has stepped up its "defense" of Taiwan and turned the island into an American occupied zone. The United States' colonial rule over Taiwan has infringed upon the territorial integrity of the People's Republic of China.

The article pointed out: The United States has tried to use Korea and Indochina as American war bases. However, due to the opposition of peace-loving people all over the world, this has not been possible. Now, besides Japan and the Philippines, Taiwan is the most important area in the American aggression plan. This is why the United States is doing its best to maintain this island.

The article said: The Chinese government has decided to liberate Taiwan from Chiang Kai-shek's hands and complete China's unification. All the Chinese people, including Buddhists, Muslims, professors, workers and peasants, unanimously support the declaration of liberating Taiwan.

The Chinese people's position is understandable. Taiwan has been a part of China since ancient times. Now the United States occupies Taiwan and treats it as a colony. The people of Taiwan are being oppressed by the rule of the United States and Chiang Kai-shek, and the illegality of this rule is just like the Dutch rule of West Irian.

### 印度尼西亚“星期日信使”周刊评论  美国占领台湾侵犯人民中国的领土完整

    美国占领台湾侵犯人民中国的领土完整
    【新华社雅加达十二日电】新出版的“星期日信使”周刊发表一篇文章，评论中国人民解放台湾的正义性。
    文章说，人人都知道台湾是中国的合法的领土，没有人怀疑这个事实。自从蒋介石战败——实际上是美国的失败——以来，美国不遗余力地庇护流亡的蒋介石，希图挽救他们在中国大陆上的失败。美国在一九五零年六月侵占了台湾，这是非法的。自那时以来，美国就加紧进行它在台湾的“防御”，并把这个岛屿变为美国的占领区。美国对台湾进行殖民统治，已侵犯了中华人民共和国的领土完整。
    文章指出：美国曾试图把朝鲜和印度支那当作美国的战争基地。但是，由于全世界爱好和平的人民的反对，这已办不到了。现在，除了日本和菲律宾，台湾是美国侵略计划中的最重要的地区。这就是美国竭其全力以保持这个岛屿的原因。
    文章说：中国政府决定从蒋介石手中解放台湾，完成中国的统一。中国所有人民，包括佛教徒、回教徒、教授、工人和农民，都一致拥护解放台湾的声明。
    中国人民的立场是可以理解的。台湾自古以来就是中国的一部分。现在美国占领着台湾，把它当作殖民地，台湾人民正受着美国和蒋介石统治的压迫，这种统治的非法性正如荷兰统治西伊里安一样。
