    Guarantee the Completion of Railway Transportation Tasks Through Adjudication Work
    Eight Railway Specialized Courts Have Been Established Nationwide
    In order to implement the resolutions of the Second National Judicial Conference and guarantee the smooth completion of railway transportation tasks through adjudication work, eight local railway specialized courts have been established in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Taiyuan, Harbin, Zhengzhou, Jilin, and Gansu.
    Before the formal establishment of these eight railway specialized courts, the judicial departments and railway departments generally jointly formed working groups to conduct in-depth investigations into the various types of cases that had occurred in the railway system over the years and the main problems in current railway transportation. They also extensively and deeply carried out publicity and education among the employees, explaining the necessity of establishing railway specialized courts. This allowed the cadres of the working groups to have a preliminary understanding of the railway transportation work, and the employees to have a certain understanding of the establishment of railway specialized courts, creating favorable conditions for carrying out adjudication work along the railway lines in the future.
    After the establishment of these eight railway specialized courts, they generally handled a number of counter-revolutionary sabotage cases, major corruption and theft cases, and major liability accident cases related to railway transportation and production work, in conjunction with the central work of the railway departments. According to incomplete statistics, the railway specialized courts in Tianjin, Harbin, and Gansu accepted 207 cases of counter-revolutionary sabotage, corruption and theft, and major liability accidents from their establishment to April this year. Generally, the railway specialized procuratorate first investigates and prosecutes, and the adjudicators of the railway specialized court and the people's assessors of the railway department form a collegial panel for trial. For typical cases with educational significance, public trial meetings are also held to expand the publicity of laws and disciplines. After the meetings, the railway departments organize employees to study and discuss. Therefore, the handling of these cases has played a certain role in protecting state property and ensuring railway transportation. After the Gansu Railway Specialized Court vigorously handled the counter-revolutionary Wang Xuzhong's sabotage case, the employees further realized the serious harm of counter-revolutionary sabotage, thereby further improving their political vigilance. In many places, after the specialized courts handled major liability accident cases, employees conducted inspections in connection with their daily work during discussions, found out the causes of the accidents, and put forward ways to improve their work, which played a good role in preventing liability accidents, ensuring transportation safety, and improving railway management work. For example, in March this year, the Harbin Railway Specialized Court held a public trial meeting attended by 1,000 employees and handled the major liability accident case of Gao Yuangui, who violated orders and did not comply with the "Railway Technical Management Regulations," resulting in a head-on collision of trains. After the meeting, many employees held discussions. After finding out the main causes of the accident, they proposed guarantees: in the future, they will resolutely abide by orders, operate in accordance with the "Technical Management Regulations," and pay attention to technical security, so as to reduce and eliminate liability accidents. After the Tianjin Railway Specialized Court publicly tried a case in which Zhang Fa, a switchman at Nancang Station, consistently violated regulations, neglected safety, and caused a vehicle collision that killed a person, the administrative leaders of Nancang Station accepted the lessons of this major accident, supplemented and revised the "Technical Safety Operation Rules," "Safety Rotation Duty System" and other safety systems, and educated workers to conscientiously implement them. Therefore, until June of this year, not only had no major accidents occurred, but also work efficiency had been improved, and the task had been overfulfilled for several months from January of this year.
    Because the work of the railway specialized courts has achieved good results, the railway administrative leadership departments and the vast number of employees in various places attach great importance to the establishment of this specialized adjudication agency. Railway bureaus in various places not only actively help the specialized courts solve problems such as housing and transportation, but also take the initiative to transfer cadres to enrich the organization of the specialized courts. The Taiyuan Railway Bureau transferred 18 cadres, 10 of whom went to work in the specialized court.

    从审判工作方面保障铁路运输任务的完成
    全国已建立八个铁路专门法院
    为了贯彻执行第二届全国司法会议的决议，从审判工作方面保障铁路运输任务的顺利完成，全国已有北京、天津、上海、太原、哈尔滨、郑州、吉林和甘肃八个地方建立了铁路专门法院。
    这八个铁路专门法院正式成立以前，一般都先由司法部门与铁路部门共同抽调干部组成工作组，深入铁路调查研究历年来铁路系统所发生的各类案件的情况和当前铁路交通运输上的主要问题，广泛深入地向职工群众进行宣传教育，说明建立铁路专门法院的必要性。这样就可使工作组的干部对铁路运输工作的情况有一个初步的了解，使职工群众对于建立铁路专门法院有一定的认识，为以后在铁路沿线开展审判工作创造了有利条件。
    这八个铁路专门法院成立后，一般都结合铁路部门的中心工作，处理了一批与铁路运输和生产工作有关的反革命破坏案件、重大的贪污盗窃案件和重大的责任事故案件。根据不完全的统计，天津、哈尔滨、甘肃三个铁路专门法院从成立到今年四月，已受理了反革命破坏案件、贪污盗窃案件和重大责任事故等案件二百零七件。一般都先由铁路专门检察署侦查起诉，并由铁路专门法院的审判人员与铁路部门的人民陪审员组织合议庭进行审判。对其中有教育意义的典型案件，还开了公开审判大会，借以扩大法纪的宣传，会后并由铁路部门组织职工学习讨论。因此，这些案件的处理，对于保护国家财产和保障铁路运输都起了一定作用。甘肃铁路专门法院在大张旗鼓地处理反革命分子王虚中破坏案后，职工们进一步认识到反革命破坏的严重危害，从而更加提高了政治警惕性。还有许多地方，在专门法院处理重大责任事故案件后，职工群众都在讨论中联系日常工作进行了检查，找出发生事故的原因，并提出改进工作的办法，这对于防止责任事故、保障运输安全、改进铁路管理工作更是起了良好的作用。例如哈尔滨铁路专门法院在今年三月间召开了一个有一千多职工参加的公判大会，处理了高元贵违反命令、不遵守“铁路技术管理规程”因而造成列车正面冲突的重大责任事故案件。会后，许多职工进行了座谈，他们在找出事故发生的主要原因后，提出保证：今后要坚决遵守命令，遵照“技术管理规程”作业，注意技术保安，以减少和消灭责任事故。天津铁路专门法院公开审判了一件南仓站连接员张发一贯违章作业、忽视安全、造成车辆冲突压死人命的案件后，南仓站的行政领导上接受这一重大事故的教训，补充修订了“技术安全作业细则”、“安全轮流值日制”等安全制度，并教育工人认真地贯彻执行，因而直到今年六月不但没有发生重大事故，而且提高了工作效率，从今年一月份起，几个月来都超额完成了任务。
    由于铁路专门法院的工作获得了良好成绩，各地铁路行政领导部门和广大职工群众对于建立这一专门的审判机构都很重视。各地铁路管理局不仅积极帮助专门法院解决房屋和交通工具等问题，而且主动抽调干部充实专门法院的机构。太原铁路管理局就抽调了十八个干部，其中有十个到专门法院工作。
