Another fourteen private factories in Tianjin implemented joint state-private ownership on September 3rd. These factories are: Zhenhua Paper Mill, Lianhua Rubber Factory, Huawei Watch Factory, Qilian Hardware Manufacturing Factory, Rongnianchun Iron Factory, Xinghua Iron Factory, Lianchang Electrical Machinery Factory, Taifeng Iron Screen Factory, Shengsheng Glass and Steel Utensil Manufacturing Factory, North China First Enamel Factory, Dongfang Paint Factory, Fuli Chemical Appliance Factory, Chengwenxin Stationery Factory, and Fuxing Kiln. These factories have a total of more than 1,800 employees. The products of these factories include roofing felt base paper, grass board paper, insulated gloves, insulated boots, watches, screws, bicycle freewheels, water meters, iron screens, thermos bottles, enamel utensils, paint, glass bottles, ink, bricks, and tiles. In recent years, under the leadership and support of the state-owned economy, the employees have worked actively and diligently, enabling the enterprises to achieve varying degrees of development and transformation. Lianhua Rubber Factory had only sixteen or seventeen employees in the early days of liberation, but has now developed into a factory with more than seventy employees. Chengwenxin Stationery Factory's "Ostrich" ink was squeezed out by imperialist commodities before liberation, and even with a daily output of one or two hundred dozen, it was difficult to find sales outlets; now, even with a daily output of four thousand dozen, the supply still falls short of demand.

After the announcement of the general task of the state's transition period, the capitalists of these factories, after studying, recognized the necessity of carrying out socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and successively applied to the People's Government for the implementation of joint state-private ownership. The state, based on needs and the conditions of these factories, successively approved the applications and sent cadres to work with the capitalists of each factory to carry out the preparatory work before the joint venture. At present, the work of asset inventory and valuation and personnel arrangements in these factories has been basically completed. During the preparation period for the joint venture, the employees of these factories, on the one hand, assisted both public and private parties in carrying out asset inventory and valuation, and on the other hand, worked hard to improve technology and increase production efficiency. The employees of Huawei Watch Factory actively studied the replacement of copper with iron in places where copper was not necessary for watchmaking, saving copper for the country and solving the problem of raw material supply for the enterprise. Lianchang Electrical Machinery Factory originally processed water meters for state-owned commercial departments and often delivered goods late. During the preparation period for the joint venture, the employees worked hard to improve production, and in May and June, they delivered goods on time. The output of various products of Zhenhua Paper Mill in the second quarter increased by 50 to 80 percent compared with the first quarter, and the cost also decreased by 5 to 13 percent, with a total cost reduction of more than 700 million yuan.

    天津市又有十四个私营工厂实行公私合营
    天津市又有十四个私营工厂在九月三日实行公私合营。这些工厂是：振华造纸厂、联华橡胶厂、华威钟表厂、企联五金制造厂、荣年春铁工厂、兴华铁工厂、联昌电机机械厂、泰丰铁纱厂、生生玻璃钢铁用具制造厂、华北第一搪瓷厂、东方油漆厂、福利化学料器厂、诚文信文具厂、复兴窑厂。这些工厂共有职工一千八百多人。这些工厂的产品有油毡原纸、草版纸、绝缘手套、绝缘靴、钟表、螺丝钉、自行车飞轮、水表、铁纱、暖水瓶、搪瓷用具、油漆、玻璃瓶、墨水、砖瓦等。几年来，这些工厂在国营经济的领导和扶植下，职工积极努力，使企业都有不同程度的发展和改造。联华橡胶厂在解放初期只有职工十六、七人，现在已发展成为有七十多人的工厂。诚文信文具厂的“鸵鸟”墨水，在解放前受帝国主义商品的排挤，日产一、二百打还找不到销路；现在日产四千打也供不应求。
    国家过渡时期总任务公布后，这些工厂的资方经过学习，认识到资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的必要性，先后向人民政府申请实行公私合营。国家根据需要和这些工厂的条件，先后予以批准，并派干部与各厂资方共同进行了合营前的准备工作。现在，这些工厂的清产估值工作和人事安排工作均已基本上完成。这些工厂的职工在合营准备工作期间一方面协助公、私双方进行清产估值，一方面努力改进技术，提高生产效率。华威钟表厂的职工们，积极钻研将制钟表不必要用铜的地方用铁代替，为国家节约了铜，并解决了企业的原料供应问题。联昌电机机械厂原来给国营商业部门加工水表经常误期交货，在企业进行合营准备期间职工们努力改进生产，五、六月份都按期交货了。振华造纸厂第二季度的各种产品产量较第一季度提高了百分之五十到八十，成本也降低了百分之五到十三，共计降低成本额七亿多元。
