The cadres of the Northwest Trading Company system, after studying the general task of the state during the transition period, universally attached importance to the work of organizing export goods. In the second quarter of this year, the Northwest Trading Company system (excluding Xinjiang) organized the export of nineteen kinds of goods, totaling one thousand and ninety-eight tons, exceeding the second quarter export plan by 82.65 percent, an increase of 106.13 percent compared with the same period last year.

In order to expand the sources of export goods, trade companies in various parts of the Northwest actively carried out the work of purchasing export goods. The Baoji Trading Branch of Shaanxi Province used leaflets, blackboards, and other means to publicize the important significance of exporting local and special products to the broad masses of farmers. The farmers in the county actively sold local products, including more than a dozen kinds that could be exported. The Wuzhong Trading Branch of Ningxia Province made preparations for the purchase of licorice in the first quarter. Due to timely preparation, the licorice purchase plan was overfulfilled by 85.53 percent. (Fang Chengjie)

    西北贸易公司积极开展收购出口物资工作

    为了扩大出口货源，西北各地贸易公司积极开展了收购出口物资的工作。陕西省宝鸡贸易分公司利用传单、黑板报等向广大农民宣传了出口土产、特产的重要意义，该县农民出卖土产十分踊跃，其中可以出口的土产有十几种。宁夏省吴忠贸易分公司在第一季度就进行了收购甘草的准备工作，由于准备及时，甘草收购计划超额完成百分之八十五点五三。　（方承杰）
