Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, September 6th: As of September 4th, the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army had completed the transfer of all prisoners of war from the French Union forces in North and Central Vietnam. The transfer was originally scheduled to be completed on September 2nd, but was delayed due to heavy rain and lack of transportation.

On the side of the French Union forces, as of September 4th, they were still detaining 7,511 personnel from the Vietnamese People's Army, not including those not mentioned in the list provided by the French to the Vietnamese People's Army, and those prisoners of war and cadres who were hidden or assassinated by the Ngo Dinh Diem group.

Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, September 5th: Brigadier General de Castries, who was captured by the Vietnamese People's Army in the Dien Bien Phu campaign, made a statement to Vietnamese and foreign newspaper reporters on the 3rd before being handed over to the French side.

De Castries spoke about his life in captivity, saying, "I had books to read and could regularly have very objective conversations with Vietnamese cadres who were quite witty and polite. The behavior of the soldiers guarding me has always been correct and often friendly. I cannot help but admire the attitude of the Vietnamese cadres towards me. They always treated me as an equal, explained their views to me in detail with obvious goodwill, and listened to my views, without any attempt to put pressure on my judgment."

De Castries said, "In terms of material life, my life was the same as that of the soldiers around me, and I am sure my food was better than theirs. I suffered from severe dysentery during the transfer, but despite the lack of medicine, I was well taken care of and recovered my health. During this period, there was a Vietnamese doctor with us."

De Castries said that the high morale of the Vietnamese People's Army came from the ideal for which they were fighting. He praised the bravery and training of the Vietnamese People's Army soldiers, and praised the tactics used by the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army in attacking Dien Bien Phu. De Castries also said that the supply problem, although with many difficulties, was well resolved. All the Vietnamese people put their minds to solving these problems. What an amazing force! He said, "I found that the Vietnamese people all firmly believed in the actions stipulated by the democratic government and gladly accepted the sacrifices required of them by the long struggle for independence led by this government."

Speaking about the Indochina armistice, De Castries said, "This was the only reasonable solution expected a few months ago, but at that time, favorable conditions were not met. The armistice ended the eight-year-long and enormously costly struggle for the people of both countries. The armistice allows the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to begin building its future politically and economically. It also allows France to devote itself to its own many problems. The agreement reached is fair and glorious to the people of both countries, which proves that any dispute between countries can be resolved peacefully on the basis of mutual respect for the rights of each country. In addition, the political clauses in the agreement guarantee for the first time the unification of Vietnam in the near future, as well as the unification of Laos and Cambodia. In this way, the obstacles encountered in the restoration of unification in Germany and Korea are avoided. The armistice is a major step towards a definite and lasting peace in Indochina and the development of trade between the Indochinese countries and France, and a major step towards friendship between the peoples of all countries."

    越南已把北越和中越的法方战俘移交完毕
    德卡斯特莱在获释前发表谈话感谢越南的宽大待遇
    【新华社六日讯】越南通讯社北越讯：到九月四日为止，越南人民军总司令部已把在北越和中越的法兰西联邦部队的战俘全部移交完毕。移交工作本应在九月二日完成，但是由于下大雨和缺乏交通工具而受到了耽搁。
    在法兰西联邦部队方面，他们到九月四日为止还拘留着七千五百一十一名越南人民军方面的人员，其中尚不包括那些在法方交给越南人民军的名单中没有提到的和为吴庭艳集团所隐藏或暗害的战俘和干部。
    【新华社六日讯】据越南通讯社北越五日讯：在奠边府战役中被越南人民军俘掳的德卡斯特莱准将，三日在被移交给法方前向越南报纸及外国报纸的记者发表谈话。
    德卡斯特莱谈到他在被俘期间的生活说，我有书可以读，而且可以经常同相当有风趣和有礼貌的越南干部进行很客观的谈话。守卫我的士兵的表现一直是正确的而且往往是友好的。我不能不钦佩越南干部对我的态度。他们总是以平等的地位来对待我，怀着明显的好意向我详细说明他们的见解，并且听取我的见解，毫无对我的判断施以压力的企图。
    德卡斯特莱说，在物质生活方面，我的生活和我周围的士兵们一样，我并且确知我的伙食比他们的伙食还要好些。我在转移的途中曾患了严重的痢疾，但是，尽管医药缺乏，我还是得到了很好的照顾并且恢复了健康。在这个期间，有一位越南大夫同我们在一起。
    德卡斯特莱说，越南人民军高昂的士气是从他们为之而战的那个理想来的。他称赞了越南人民军士兵的勇敢和有训练，并且称赞了越南人民军总司令部在攻击奠边府时所采用的战术。德卡斯特莱又说，供应问题虽然有许多困难，却很好地得到了解决。全体越南人民都用了心思来解决这些问题。这种力量是何等惊人啊！他说，我发觉越南人民全都十分相信民主政府所规定的行动，并欣然接受这个政府领导的争取独立的长期斗争所要他们接受的牺牲。
    德卡斯特莱谈到印度支那停战时说，这是几个月前所期望的唯一合理的解决办法，但是那时没有遇到有利的条件。停战为两国人民结束了这场持续八年之久而消耗巨大的争斗。停战使越南民主共和国可以开始在政治上和经济上缔造它的前途。也使法国可以致力于它自己的颇多的问题。已达成的协议对两国人民是公平而光荣的，这证明各国之间的任何争端都可以在互相尊重每一国家的权利的基础上和平解决。此外，协定中的政治的条款第一次保证了越南全国在不久将来的统一以及老挝和柬埔寨的统一。这样，就避免了在德国和朝鲜恢复统一的问题上所遇到的障碍。停战是向印度支那的确定的和持久的和平以及印度支那国家和法国之间的贸易发展迈进了一大步，是向各国人民之间的友谊迈进了一大步。
