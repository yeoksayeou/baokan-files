Dear comrades and friends,

As our government delegation arrives in Beijing, the glorious capital of our great friend, the People's Republic of China—on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of Chin—we would like to extend our warmest greetings and heartfelt congratulations, on behalf of the Mongolian people and their government, to the citizens of Beijing and the fraternal hundreds of millions of Chinese people.

This year, the celebration of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China coincides with a historic event taking place throughout the country—the convening the First Session of the National People's Congress and the adoption of the Constitution of the People’s Republic. This Constitution legislatively consolidates the great victory of the Chinese people, which is the result of many years of heroic struggle by the Chinese people.

The great victory won by the Chinese people in the glorious national liberation revolution and the founding of the People's Republic of China is an event of world historical significance.

The six hundred million Chinese people are engaged in building a happy new life, and have now become a major factor and force in the powerful camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, headed by our common friend, the great Soviet Union.

The ever-increasing international prestige of the People's Republic of China has a very beneficial influence on the struggle of the people of all countries to ease international tensions and safeguard and consolidate peace in Asia and the world.

The Mongolian people, like all progressive mankind, are sincerely delighted with the great achievements made by their friends—the Chinese people, who are successfully advancing towards socialism under the wise leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party and the beloved leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong.

The close, fraternal friendship between the Mongolian and Chinese people is growing and strengthening for the happiness of our two peoples. This friendship also helps to maintain and consolidate the cause of peace, and helps the lofty cause of all progressive forces in the world in their struggle for the happiness of mankind.

The Mongolian people sincerely hope that the friendly, great Chinese people will achieve new and greater successes in realizing the socialist industrialization of the country, further developing agriculture, and improving the material welfare of the people, and in vigorously consolidating their people's democratic state.

Long live the unbreakable friendship between Mongolian and Chinese people!

Long live our great neighbor, the powerful People's Republic of China!
Long live the camp for peace, democracy and socialism, headed by the great Soviet Union!

Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the teacher and leader of the Chinese people!
