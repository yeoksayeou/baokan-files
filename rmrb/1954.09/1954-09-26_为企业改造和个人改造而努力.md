Striving for Enterprise Transformation and Personal Transformation

Li Zhuchen, Delegate to the National People's Congress, General Manager of the Joint Public-Private Jiuda Salt Industry Company

    After studying and discussing the general task for the transition period and the draft constitution, private industrialists and businessmen generally understand that the future of capitalist industry and commerce is to gradually complete socialist transformation through the path of state capitalism under the government's policy of utilization, restriction, and transformation. Therefore, within industrial and commercial circles, an increasing number of advanced elements, having raised their ideological consciousness, recognized the future and the direction of their efforts, and with a loyal and honest attitude, are actively striving for the integration of enterprise and personal transformation under the administration of state administrative organs, the leadership of the state-owned economy, and the supervision of the masses of workers. For example, many enterprises have been approved for joint public-private ownership, which has not only given the enterprise a new look and rapidly developed productivity, but also enabled capitalists to be continuously educated and trained in new things and new knowledge under the leadership and influence of socialist elements, gradually transforming themselves, enabling them to fully utilize their talents and play a positive role, and thus feeling excited and happy. Many enterprises have already embarked on intermediate or elementary forms of state capitalism, and under the leadership of the state-owned economy, the quality of products is continuously improving, costs are continuously decreasing, and enterprise profits are also continuously increasing. To strive for further advancement towards higher forms, they are actively improving production, improving management, and striving to create conditions. As for some self-employed enterprises, they realize that the country must move towards socialism, and that the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is the general trend and the will of the people. Therefore, they are also actively striving to create conditions to embark on the path of state capitalism. These manifestations are not only beneficial to the country and the people, but also very beneficial to the enterprises and the individuals who run them. Because as long as they can follow this bright and correct path forward, not only can the enterprises complete socialist transformation, but the individuals who run them will also be transformed into citizens of a socialist society through transformation.
    However, judging from the current situation, although an increasing number of private industrialists and businessmen are actively and voluntarily striving for the integration of enterprise and personal transformation, it is undeniable that there are still many people who are hesitating and watching, reluctant to part with the free market, and unwilling to accept the leadership of the state-owned economy. There are also those who emphasize that their enterprises do not have sufficient conditions to embark on the path of state capitalism, unwilling to find ways and actively create conditions. Among them, a portion of people mistakenly hold a negative attitude towards management, and even engage in phenomena such as withdrawing capital, purchasing large quantities of living materials, and indulging in personal enjoyment and extravagance to resist transformation. Such thoughts and behaviors demonstrate the corrupt nature of the bourgeoisie, who are selfish and only seek profit. In today's national socialist construction, such thoughts and behaviors have a serious destructive effect on national construction and are a major obstacle to the transformation of enterprises and individuals. They are incompatible with the interests of the people of the whole country. Therefore, we should loudly appeal to them, awaken them from the dream of being immersed in the corrupt capitalist business ideology, actively and voluntarily create conditions, and strive for the integration of enterprise and personal transformation. This is the only correct and bright path for capitalist industry and commerce.
    Why does the state carry out socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce? Through the study of the general task and the draft constitution, we have made it clear that it is mainly because the capitalist ownership system, such a production relation, seriously hinders the development of productive forces and the socialist construction carried out by the state during the transition period, and therefore must be transformed. Capitalist industry and commerce, being dominated by the profit-seeking business ideology, exhibits a blind state of anarchy in production. Not only are there serious waste phenomena, but they never care about improving management and improving technology. The quality of products is already low, and the cost is high. Some, in order to pursue high profits, do not hesitate to cut corners and produce shoddy products. This creates a serious contradiction with the state's planned construction and hinders the state's statistics and utilization of enterprise productivity. In labor-capital relations, the chaotic wage and working hour system generated under the capitalist management method, and the capitalist's never valuing the safety and welfare of workers in production, hinder the improvement of the enthusiasm of employees and the spirit of production innovation. Therefore, the contradictions between labor and capital only develop day by day, making the production potential of enterprises unable to be properly exploited. This forms the basic factor hindering the development of productive forces. Today, the state is carrying out large-scale socialist economic construction, and of course, cannot tolerate this phenomenon that the development of productive forces is restricted by capitalist production relations. It must be transformed so that its original production relations can be gradually changed, so that the productivity of enterprises can be developed as it should be, and production and management can be gradually incorporated into the national plan, and finally complete socialist transformation.
    Since the principle that capitalist enterprises must be transformed has been clarified, what attitude should private industrialists and businessmen take towards this transformation issue? I believe that from the perspective of private industrialists and businessmen themselves, when considering the transformation issue, it should first be clarified that enterprise transformation and personal transformation are two aspects of a whole, which are advanced simultaneously, mutually influencing and mutually promoting, and cannot be separated and carried out in isolation. Enterprise transformation is to resolve the contradictions between the two ownership systems, to replace the original capitalist management with socialist management, gradually change the original production relations of the enterprise, and finally transform it into a socialist enterprise. Therefore, capitalist industry and commerce must pass through various forms of state capitalism so that it can connect and cooperate with the socialist economy, so that it can be well transformed under the leadership of the socialist economy. Personal transformation is to transform the capitalist ideology of capitalists, so that individuals can establish a holistic concept in their thinking, correctly understand the principle that individual interests must obey overall interests, promote the spirit of patriotism and law-abiding, strengthen the view of serving the people, and eliminate selfish, profit-seeking, and decadent ideas that are harmful to the country and the people. Therefore, personal transformation is also ideological transformation. In order to transform faster and better, in addition to individuals having to study hard, they must also actively absorb new knowledge and advanced experience from the leadership of the socialist economy while the enterprise is moving towards state capitalism to transform themselves, so that their ideological awareness and professional level can be continuously improved. This will be more conducive to the transformation of the enterprise and will also lay the foundation for individuals to enter a socialist society.
    Ideological transformation is a long-term and arduous ideological struggle. This is precisely because our private industrialists and businessmen have been dominated by the corrupt ideology of the bourgeoisie for a long time, and their class nature of harming others and benefiting themselves, and their exploitation ideology, have been deeply ingrained. Therefore, when our industrialists and businessmen carry out transformation, they must, with the spirit of reforming themselves, face new things and new knowledge, make up their minds, learn humbly, recognize the corrupt nature of capitalist management methods and the harmfulness of the essence of the bourgeoisie, connect with reality, conduct self-examination and self-criticism, and at the same time rely on the selfless help and leadership of the working class, and actively strive for the integration of enterprise and personal transformation. In this way, they can transition to socialist society, become citizens of a socialist society, and enjoy the happy life of a socialist society in the future, just like the people of the whole country. As for those few lawless elements who resolutely resist transformation, are willing to destroy themselves, or have ulterior motives and deliberately engage in reaction, they are all enemies of patriotic and law-abiding industrialists and businessmen. We should draw a clear line, be vigilant, closely monitor them, and launch a relentless struggle against them.

    为企业改造和个人改造而努力
    全国人民代表大会代表 公私合营久大盐业公司总经理  李烛尘
    私营工商业者在通过过渡时期总任务和宪法草案的学习讨论后，一般地都认识了资本主义工商业的前途，是要在政府采取利用、限制和改造的政策下，通过国家资本主义道路，逐步完成社会主义改造。因此，在工商业界中，已有越来越多的先进分子，在提高了思想觉悟，认清了前途和努力方向的基础上，以忠诚老实的态度，在国家行政机关的管理、国营经济的领导和工人群众的监督下，积极努力争取企业与个人相结合的改造。如已有不少的企业获准为公私合营，不但企业的面貌一新，生产力得到迅速发展，并且资本家个人也在社会主义成份的领导与影响下，不断受到新事物和新知识的教育锻炼，逐步得到改造，得以充分发挥本身才能及积极作用，从而感到兴奋愉快；很多的企业已经走上国家资本主义中级或低级形式，在国营经济的领导下，产品的质量不断提高，成本不断降低，企业利润也不断有所增加，为争取进一步走向高级形式，也正在那里积极改进生产、改善经营，努力创造条件；至于一些自营企业认识到国家一定要走向社会主义，资本主义工商业必须进行社会主义的改造，乃是大势所趋人心所向的道理，因而也在那里积极努力创造条件，争取走上国家资本主义道路。这些表现不仅对国家对人民有利，对企业和经营企业的个人也是很有利的，因为只要能够遵循着这条光明正确的大道前进，不但企业可以完成社会主义的改造，经营企业的个人也会经过改造成为社会主义社会的公民。
    但就目前的情况来看，尽管已经有越来越多的私营工商业者，积极地、主动地争取企业与个人相结合的改造，但不可否认的还有不少的人，仍在那里踌躇观望，留恋于自由市场，不愿意接受国营经济的领导；也有的人强调自己的企业条件不够，无法走向国家资本主义道路，不肯想办法，积极创造条件，其中并有一部分人，错误地抱着消极经营的态度，甚至发生了抽逃资金，大量购置生活资料以及个人尽情挥霍享乐等等抗拒改造的现象。像这些思想和行为，都是表现了资产阶级自私自利唯利是图的腐朽本质，在国家进行社会主义建设的今天，由于这种思想和行为，对国家建设起着严重的破坏作用，对企业与个人的改造来说，也是一种很大的阻碍，与全国人民的利益是不相容的，因此，应该向他们大声疾呼，唤醒他们沉缅在腐朽的资本主义经营思想中的迷梦，积极地、主动地创造条件，争取企业与个人相结合的改造，这才是资本主义工商业的唯一正确的光明道路。
    为什么国家要对资本主义工商业进行社会主义的改造？通过总任务和宪法草案的学习，使我们明确了主要是由于资本家所有制这样一个生产关系，严重阻碍着生产力的发展和国家在过渡时期内进行的社会主义建设，因而必须加以改造。资本主义工商业由于受着唯利是图的经营思想的支配，在生产上表现着盲目的无政府状态，不只存在着严重的浪费现象，而且从不关心经营管理的改善与技术的改进，本来产品质量就低，成本就高，有的为了追求高额利润更不惜偷工减料粗制滥造，这就和国家有计划的建设发生了严重矛盾，并且妨碍着国家对于企业生产力的统计和利用；在劳资关系上，由于在资本主义经营方式下，产生的混乱的工资及工时制度，和资本家从不重视工人在生产上的安全与福利，障碍了职工群众劳动热情和生产革新精神的提高，所以劳资间的矛盾只有日益发展，使企业的生产潜力不能得到适当的发挥，这就形成了阻碍生产力发展的基本因素，在今天国家正在进行着大规模的社会主义经济建设，对于这种生产力由于受到资本主义生产关系的束缚，而得不到发展的现象，当然是不能容许的，必须加以改造，使它们原有的生产关系逐步改变，这样才能使企业的生产力得到应有的发展，生产经营也可以逐步纳入国家计划，最后完成社会主义改造。
    资本主义的企业必须改造的道理既然明确了，那么私营工商业者应该以怎样的态度，来对待这一改造问题呢？我以为从私营工商业者本身来看改造问题，应该首先明确企业改造与个人改造是一个整体的两方面，是同时并进相互影响相互推动的，不能分割开来孤立地进行。企业改造是为了解决两种所有制的矛盾，是要用社会主义的经营管理代替原有的资本主义经营管理，逐步改变原企业的生产关系，最后把它改造为社会主义的企业，因此，资本主义工商业就必须通过各种形式的国家资本主义，使与社会主义经济发生联系与合作，才能在社会主义经济的领导下，很好地进行改造。个人改造就是改造资本家的资本主义思想，使个人在思想上树立起整体观念，正确认识个人利益必须服从整体利益的道理，发扬爱国守法精神，加强为人民服务的观点，清除自私自利唯利是图的、有害于国家人民的腐朽思想。因此说，个人的改造，也就是思想改造。为了改造得更快、更好，除去个人必须努力学习外，还要在企业走向国家资本主义的同时，从社会主义经济的领导中，积极吸取新知识和先进经验来改造自己，使个人的思想觉悟和业务水平不断提高，这样才能更有利于企业的改造，也才能为个人进入社会主义社会打下基础。
    思想改造是一个长期的、艰苦的思想斗争，这正是由于我们私营工商业者长时期受着资产阶级腐朽思想的支配，其损人利己、唯利是图的阶级本质，剥削思想，业已根深柢固的缘故，因此，我们工商业者进行改造，就必须以洗心革面的精神，在新事物和新知识的面前，痛下决心，虚心学习，认清资本主义经营方式的腐朽性和资产阶级本质的危害性，联系实际，自我检查、自我批评，同时依靠工人阶级大公无私的帮助和领导，积极努力从事企业与个人相结合的改造，如此，就能过渡到社会主义社会，成为社会主义社会的公民，将来和全国人民一样，享受到社会主义社会的幸福生活。至于那些坚决抗拒改造，自甘毁灭，或别有企图、蓄意反动的少数不法分子，都是爱国守法工商业者的敌人，我们应该划清界限、提高警惕、严密监视，并且要向他们展开无情的斗争。
