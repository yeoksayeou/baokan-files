    Examination of the Translation of "Striving to Further Improve Soviet Literature"
    Editor's Note: On August 16th, this newspaper published an article by Comrade Ke Lian criticizing a translation in the seventh issue of "Learning Translations" (titled "'Perfunctory' Translation Attitude"). The editors of "Learning Translations" and the translator of that article have both examined their work attitudes. Below are their self-criticisms.
    I. Self-Criticism by the Editors of "Learning Translations"
    Comrade Ke Lian's criticism in the People's Daily on August 16th regarding the translation "Striving to Further Improve Soviet Literature" published in the seventh issue of our journal is correct. We bear a significant responsibility for publishing this immature, practically crude, translation.
    When the manuscripts for the seventh issue of this journal had already been sent for typesetting, we received the ninth issue of the Soviet "Communist" magazine. We felt that this article was very important, so we made a temporary decision to find someone to rush out a translation of it, which means that we did not make proper arrangements for this work. After it was translated, due to time constraints, it was not proofread according to the established system, and we were negligent in reviewing it before sending it to print, which means that the leadership failed to uphold the work system. All of this proves that we were very irresponsible in our work. We sincerely accept these criticisms, conducted a thorough self-criticism in the editorial department, and have taken practical measures to improve our work. We have decided to re-edit and publish this translation and send it to readers with the eighth issue of this journal to make up for the loss caused by this negligence.

    II. Self-Criticism by Comrade Gao Shumei, the Translator
    Comrade Ke Lian's pertinent criticism in the "People's Daily" of my "perfunctory" translation attitude has provided me with a profound education.
    Regarding the translation of this article, after deep self-reflection, I feel that my mistakes are serious: I lacked a conscientious and responsible attitude when I started translating; and after hastily translating it, knowing that there were many places I was not sure about, I did not meticulously study and find solutions, but rushed to send it to the "Learning Translations" editorial department; after the editorial department pointed out several places that needed to be revised, I still stubbornly failed to carefully correct them one by one, and was eager to publish it. This is a series of irresponsible attitudes, and an extremely serious self-important style. Now that I have re-examined the translation, in addition to the inappropriate points pointed out by Comrade Ke Lian, I have also found many unclear and inappropriate places. The reason why I made such serious mistakes in translating this important paper is mainly because I did not deeply realize that translation is a serious political, propaganda, and educational work. My unfaithful, even erroneous, translation of the original is deceiving and harming readers.
    My work style, which lacks sufficient humility and thoroughness, cannot correctly introduce the advanced Soviet theories to the broad masses of Chinese readers. As pointed out in the "People's Daily" short commentary, as a translator, one must strengthen one's sense of responsibility and improve one's translation skills. This criticism has helped me and educated me, and made me deeply realize that in my future practical work, I must correct my work style and work attitude, learn with humility, be realistic, and earnestly do a good job in translation.　Gao Shumei

### 关于“为进一步提高苏联文学而斗争”的译文的检讨

    关于“为进一步提高苏联文学而斗争”的译文的检讨
    编者按：八月十六日本报发表了柯涟同志批评“学习译丛”第七期上一篇译文的文章（题为“‘不求甚解’的翻译态度”）。“学习译丛”的编者和那篇译文的译者都对自己的工作态度进行了检查。下面就是他们的检讨。
    一、“学习译丛”编者的检讨
    八月十六日人民日报上柯涟同志对本刊第七期所发表的译文“为进一步提高苏联文学而斗争”的批评是正确的，我们把这篇不成熟的、实际上是粗制滥造的译品发表出去，也负有很大的责任。
    本刊第七期的稿件已付排时，我们收到苏联“共产党人”杂志第九期，觉得这篇文章很重要，于是临时决定找人把它赶译出来，就是说，对这项工作没有作妥善安排。译好后又因时间关系，未按既定制度加以校订，又疏于审查，就付印了，就是说，领导方面没有坚持工作制度。这一切都证明我们在工作上是很不负责的。我们诚恳地接受这些批评，在编辑部作了深刻的检讨并采取了实际的措施改进自己的工作。我们决定把这篇译文重新校订刊出，随本刊第八期送给读者，以弥补此次疏忽造成的损失。
                        学习译丛编辑部
    二、译者高叔眉同志的检讨
    柯涟同志在“人民日报”上中肯地批评了我的
  “不求甚解”的翻译态度，使我受到一次深刻的教育。
    关于这篇文章的翻译，我深自检讨之后，觉得我的错误是严重的：在开始翻译时我既缺乏认真负责的态度；而草草译成后，明知有许多地方没有把握，竟没有缜密研究，设法解决，就仓促送给“学习译丛”编辑部；在编辑部指出若干地方须加修改后，我还自以为是地没有一一认真改正，便急于把它发表。这是一连串的不负责态度，是极为严重的自高自大的作风。现在我把译文重新检查了一下，除了柯涟同志指出的不妥之处外，还发现不少不清楚、不确当的地方。我在翻译这篇重要论文时所以犯这样严重的错误，主要是由于我没有深刻认识翻译是严肃的政治工作、宣传工作和教育工作。我把原文不忠实地，甚至错误地翻译过来，就是欺骗读者，贻害读者。
    我的这种虚心不够、钻研不够的工作作风，是不能把苏联的先进理论正确地介绍给中国广大读者的。正如“人民日报”的短评所指出的，作为一个翻译工作者，必须加强责任心和提高翻译技巧。这一次的批评帮助了我，教育了我，使我深刻认识到在今后的实际工作中一定要端正自己的工作作风和工作态度，虚心学习，实事求是，认真做好翻译工作。　高叔眉
