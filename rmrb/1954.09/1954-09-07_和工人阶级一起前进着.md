Editor's Note: The meetings of the People's Congresses of all provinces and cities across the country have concluded one after another. The representatives to the People's Congresses of all provinces and cities are outstanding individuals and representative figures elected by the people and warmly supported by the masses. The several provincial People's Congress representatives introduced here are just a few ordinary ones among the thousands of people's representatives. The enthusiasm of these people's representatives in serving the people diligently and their noble qualities are worthy of respect and emulation. Their work and activities fully embody the power of the people to be masters of their own affairs, and realize the principle stipulated in the draft constitution that "all power in the People's Republic of China belongs to the people."

Advancing with the Working Class
　　Xie Qingping

　　Dong Fusheng, a representative of the Yunnan Provincial People's Congress, is now the deputy director of the Kunming Smelting Plant. A little over two years ago, he was a smelting worker at the reverberatory furnace in this plant. In production, he worked selflessly; in his position as deputy director, he relied on the Party and the workers, learned humbly, and mastered scientific management knowledge. Because of these, he was named a model worker, elected as a member of the Kunming Municipal People's Government, and now elected as a representative to the first Yunnan Provincial People's Congress.

　　Dong Fusheng’s experiences over the past few years clearly reflect the greatness of our Party, the infinite superiority of the people's democratic system of our great motherland, and the growth and strength of the working class of our country.

　　At the beginning of liberation, when the factory was taken over, Dong Fusheng did not understand that life had undergone a fundamental change. Like everyone else, he only hoped to have work and food. Through mobilizing workers to donate equipment and establishing factory management committees, he initially recognized the correctness of the Party. But even then, he still dared not completely believe that there would be a Party and government that would work entirely for the laboring people.

　　Soon, the government, even under difficult conditions, tried to restore the factory's production. Chimneys that had been idle for a long time began to smoke again, crows were driven away from the chimneys, and dozens of workers in the smelting workshop resumed work. Dong Fusheng actively operated under high-temperature conditions, his eyes suffered from the heat, and he often shed tears. During the Kuomintang reactionary rule, his eyes often ached from the heat, his eyelashes grew inwards, and his eyeballs were filled with bloodshot veins. For more than four years, he had no money to go to the hospital. This time, with the resumption of production, his eyes were burned even more painfully, and he could barely see things clearly. He was constantly worried that his eyes would go blind, the factory would not want him, and his family would starve and freeze. At that time, military representative Wang Xinliang often went to the workshop. Seeing that Dong Fusheng often rubbed his eyes, he asked, "What's wrong with your eyes?" Dong Fusheng took off his glasses and showed them to him. The military representative said with concern, "You must find a way to get them treated, it's too dangerous to continue like this!" Dong Fusheng had never heard such caring words before. This time, he felt uneasy instead, and quickly replied, "Thank you for your kindness, my eyes are always like this, it's alright."

　　The military representative's concern kept Dong Fusheng awake that night. He had thought about going to the hospital for treatment in the past, but because he had no money, this wish had never come true. However, the next day when he went to work, the production team leader told him, "The administration wants me to inform you that the trade union has requested leave for you, and the military representative will take you to Kunhua Hospital to treat your eyes. You should go quickly." He rushed out of the workshop and saw the military representative Wang Xinliang standing beside a jeep waiting for him. On the way to the hospital, Wang Xinliang said to him, "Go and recuperate with peace of mind! The state will pay the money, so don't worry." In the hospital, thinking about everything that was happening before his eyes, recalling the work done by the People's Government, and what the military representative often said to them: the Communist Party is the party of the working class; now the workers are working for themselves, not for the bureaucratic capitalists. He no longer needed to doubt these truths at all. Thinking about it, he shed tears of gratitude for the first time. Subsequently, the Party and the government carried out democratic reforms in state-owned factories and mines, eliminating counter-revolutionaries and improving unreasonable production management systems. This series of enterprise reforms gradually increased the working class's awareness of being masters of their own affairs.

　　Dong Fusheng, like other workers, felt more and more every day that he was the master of the country. He personally witnessed the changes in the lives of workers in the factory, and he felt the care of the Party and the state for the workers. He often said to his fellow workers, "The Communist Party and the People's Government truly belong to our working class, and they care about our interests in every way. If it weren't for the Communist Party, my eyes would never have recovered. In the future, we must all work hard to improve production." Dong Fusheng became more active in production. He and veteran workers Feng Mingyu, Xu Zhenglong, Yang Zigui, and others responded to the Party's call and took the lead in signing collective contracts for the first time, and overfulfilled the tasks stipulated in the contracts. In April 1951, when the Resist America, Aid Korea movement was launched in the factory, Dong Fusheng's team put forward the fighting slogan of "Produce one more pound of copper, eliminate one more American devil." With the attitude of masters of their own affairs, they put forward rationalization proposals, found shortcuts, shortened smelting time, and extended furnace life. But on April 21, a row of bricks on the top of the reverberatory furnace suddenly collapsed, and a red flame immediately burst out from the hole. Everyone was anxious about such a sudden accident, but no one could make up their minds. Dong Fusheng thought, "This furnace of copper has been smelted for dozens of hours, costing more than five tons of coal and dozens of man-hours. If we stop, it will all be wasted, and it will affect the completion of this month's task..." He immediately discussed countermeasures with other workers. Veteran worker Feng Mingyu proposed a hot repair method. Dong Fusheng looked at it and couldn't think of a better method, so he unhesitatingly decided to take the lead in hot repair. The result of this incident is well known to everyone: during the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the heroic deeds of Dong Fusheng's team in hot repairing the reverberatory furnace under a temperature of over 1,000 degrees.

　　In 1952, the "Three-Anti" movement was launched in this factory. Many management personnel in this factory were agents of the bourgeoisie and had embezzled and stolen a large amount of national wealth. The Party called on the worker masses to repel the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks and become masters of their own affairs. At that time, many workers were promoted to be responsible for workshops and departments, and Dong Fusheng was promoted to be the deputy director of the Kunming Electric Factory. Dong Fusheng thought at the time: A factory is so big, not to mention managing production, even managing meals is not easy, how can a worker manage it? At this time, the military representative Wang Xinliang convened a meeting of all newly promoted worker cadres and told everyone, "We always say that workers are masters of their own affairs, and now it is time to see if our workers can be masters of their own affairs. If we let embezzlers be the masters, the money we have worked so hard to accumulate for the country will go into their pockets, and we will not actually be good masters." After that, Dong Fusheng strengthened himself and took on the responsibility of leading the factory's production, discussing matters with newly promoted worker cadres every day and listening to the workers' opinions in the workshop. They were all unfamiliar with the business and felt that the work was difficult. Dong Fusheng said, "No matter how difficult it is, it is always much better than the embezzlers being in charge. If we don't understand, we rely on the Party and the masses, learn humbly, and no matter how well we run the factory, we will be worthy of the Communist Party." At that time, almost all worker cadres had such determination. Dong Fusheng considered various issues all day long, and he was still supporting his work at two or three o'clock in the middle of the night. In this way, he exercised his ability and will to be the master during the "Three-Anti" period.

　　Because of his loyalty to the cause of the working class, he gloriously joined the Communist Party of China before the "May Day" in this year.

　　In 1953, the country began planned economic construction. At that time, the number of employees at the Kunming Electric Factory increased four or five times. With the development of economic construction, the original Kunming Electric Factory was divided into two factories: Kunming Smelting Plant and Kunming Wire Factory. Dong Fusheng was assigned to the Kunming Smelting Plant as deputy director. The number of workers in the smelting workshop where he originally worked had increased several times, and the original veteran workers had become cadres and were responsible for workshop production. Not long after the branch factory was divided, rows of worker dormitories were built on a newly opened field. Next to the dormitories, newly built public bathhouses, barber shops, and cooperatives were opened one after another. These developments made him see the future and strength of the working class, and see the happy life of the working class. At this time, he only hated that he knew too little and could not adapt to this situation. During this period, the organization decided to send him to the Party School of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to study in order to improve his policy thinking and socialist consciousness.

　　When studying the Party's general line during the transition period at the Party School, Dong Fusheng suddenly felt that some things he had in the past did not meet the requirements of the general line. He said: "To build a socialist society in our country, we must realize the country's socialist industrialization. Existing enterprises are responsible for providing money, people, and products; as a Party cadre, I should improve my level and train myself to become a useful cadre for the country." In this way, he determined to learn the scientific factory management work. He returned to the factory from the Party School and immediately participated in the National People's Comfort Mission to the People's Liberation Army to comfort the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the border areas. In the border areas, he was with heroes and models and received a profound patriotic education. The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army had no tools and could not find any ready-made materials, but they created tools and built the border areas that had been ravaged by the enemy into a very beautiful place, building rows of brand-new houses with their own hands. In this comfort mission, the heroic model behavior of the People's Liberation Army further encouraged his enthusiasm for building a socialist society and increased his determination to overcome difficulties.

　　When Dong Fusheng returned to the factory, he felt that everything in the factory had changed. In addition to rows of new dormitories, the reverberatory furnace where he worked had gone from smelting copper in one furnace to smelting in two furnaces at the same time, and a third furnace had been built; the blast furnace had been rebuilt, and charging had become mechanized; the original one workshop had now been changed into three workshops...! All this gave him a new feeling, a new encouragement; but it also brought new difficulties to his work. When he first returned to the factory director's office, he could not understand the production daily report, and some new methods of managing production had to be learned from scratch. At this time, the Party General Branch Committee decided that he would be responsible for the production of the entire factory and manage five workshops. Although he bravely took on the responsibility, he was so busy all day that he could take care of this but not that.

　　He told Xue Zuyou, the deputy director of the factory, about this situation and obtained Xue Zuyou's help. Deputy Director Xue was a member of the factory's general branch committee and had been managing production for a longer time and was familiar with the business. With the help of Deputy Director Xue, he was able to study hard and gradually learned to read reports, learned to analyze problems and appropriately solve problems. Every morning, Dong Fusheng always went to the workshop first to understand the situation. His relationship with the workers had always been good, so the workers were willing to take the initiative to talk to him about problems. After he understood the production situation of the entire factory, he would return to the factory director's office and discuss with Deputy Director Xue the ways to solve the new problems that appeared that day. He relied on the two basic principles of relying on the masses and learning humbly, and learned to master more modern management methods.

　　After he initially learned to manage production, he had time to conduct practical and specific leadership for workshop directors and other cadres. Yang Pinzhong, the director of the cathode furnace workshop, was originally a worker. After taking on the leadership of the workshop, he did not know how to work. When problems arose, he could not calmly consider the causes of the problems, but only did the work himself, and he could not grasp the main problems. Therefore, the situation of many defective electrolytic copper ingots had not changed for a long time. Dong Fusheng saw through the problems in his leadership thinking and told him his experience. He also said to him: "Your workshop has many defective products. From all aspects, this is a major problem. You should always consider how to solve this problem. If you don't rely on the masses and don't use your brain, can you solve it? You can't do it all by yourself." Soon, he found that the Kim Hak-eui team had very few defective products and had characteristics in operation, so he helped summarize the experience and instructed the workshop director and other leaders to hold production meetings to exchange experience. After the masses accepted the advanced operation methods, the number of defective products decreased. The workshop director also learned how to lead the workshop.

　　For more than four years, Dong Fusheng and other workers have been advancing together. In the Party's various undertakings, through their own personal experiences, they have felt their own position as masters of the country and their responsibilities to the country; they have also seen the consistency of the personal interests of the working class and the interests of the country through their own personal experiences. Now, inspired by the socialist vision, they are using their own hands and their own hard work to manage their own factories and build their own country. On the eve of the convening of the Provincial People's Congress, I visited Dong Fusheng and his voters. They introduced me to these situations. His voters, Kim Hak-eui and others, also said: "Dong Fusheng is wholeheartedly serving us, not arrogant or complacent. After he became a model worker and deputy director, he cares more about the masses and humbly listens to our opinions. We all believe that he can represent our opinions and handle national affairs well." Now he has been elected as a representative to the National People's Congress, which shows the people's greater trust in him.

    和工人阶级一起前进着
  　谢清平
    云南省人民代表大会代表董福生，现在是昆明冶炼厂的副厂长。两年多以前，他是这个厂反射炉的冶炼工人。在生产中，他忘我地劳动；在担任副厂长的职务中，他依靠党和工人，虚心学习，掌握了科学的管理知识。由于这些，他被评选为劳动模范，被选为昆明市人民政府委员，现在又被选为云南省第一届人民代表大会代表。
    董福生几年来的经历，清楚地反映了我们党的伟大，反映出伟大祖国的人民民主制度的无限优越，反映出我们国家工人阶级的成长和壮大。
    解放之初，工厂被接管的时候，董福生还不懂得生活从此发生了根本的变化。他和大家一样，只希望有工做、有饭吃。通过发动工人献纳器材，成立工厂管理委员会等工作，他初步认识到党的正确。但是那时他也还不敢完全相信会有完全为劳动人民办事的党和政府。
    不久，政府又在困难的条件下，设法恢复工厂的生产。停了很久的烟囱冒烟了，老鸦从烟囱上被赶走，熔炼车间几十个工人恢复了工作。董福生在高温条件下积极操作，眼睛烤得出了毛病，经常淌着泪水。在国民党反动统治时期，他的一双眼睛常被烤得发痛，眼毛倒生，眼珠充满血丝，大概有四年多一直没钱到医院去医。这回恢复生产，他的眼睛被烤得更痛，模模糊糊地看不清东西了。他时时刻刻耽心眼睛瞎了，工厂会不要他做工，一家老小会挨饿受冻。那时候，军事代表王心良经常到车间去，他看到董福生常用手揉眼，就问：“你的眼睛怎么啦？”董福生取下眼镜给他看。军事代表关切地说：“要想法去医好，这样下去太危险了！”董福生从来没有听人说过这样关心的话，这回，他反而觉得不安了，连忙回答说：“谢谢你的好意，这双眼睛常这样，不要紧。”
    军事代表的关心，使董福生在当天晚上没有睡好觉。他过去也曾想到医院去治眼，因为没钱，这个愿望从来没有实现。然而就在第二天上班的时候，生产小组长告诉他说：“行政上要我通知你，工会给你请了假，军事代表送你到昆华医院去医眼睛，叫你赶快去。”他赶出车间，迎面看见军事代表王心良站在吉普车旁等他。在去医院的路上，王心良对他说：“你安心去养病吧！钱由国家出，用不着耽心。”在医院里，他想着眼前发生的一切，回忆着人民政府所做的工作，以及军事代表经常对他们所说的话：共产党是工人阶级的政党；现在工人干活是为着自己，不是为官僚资本家。这些道理他现在完全用不着再怀疑了。他想着想着，第一次淌下了感激的眼泪。接着，党和政府又在国营厂矿企业进行了民主改革，清除反革命分子，改进不合理的生产管理制度，这一系列的企业改革工作，逐步逐步地提高了工人阶级当家做主的觉悟。
    董福生和其他工人一样，一天比一天更加感觉到自己是国家的主人，他亲眼看到厂里工人生活的变化，他感到党和国家对工人的关怀。他常对工人同志说：“共产党和人民政府真是我们工人阶级的，处处关心我们的利益，我这双眼睛要不是共产党来了，那里会好，以后，我们都得努力搞好生产。”董福生在生产上更积极了，他和老工人冯明雨、徐正龙、杨自贵等响应党的号召，第一次带头签订了集体合同，并且超额完成合同所规定的任务。一九五
  一年四月，正是抗美援朝运动在厂里开展起来的时候，董福生小组提出“多生产一斤铜，多消灭一个美国鬼子”的战斗口号。他们以主人翁的态度，提出合理化建议，找窍门，使冶炼时间缩短，炉子寿命延长。但在四月二十一日，反射炉炉顶突然有一排砖垮下去了，窟窿里立刻冒出通红的火焰。对于这样一个突然发生的事故，谁都着急，但都拿不定主意。董福生想：“这炉铜炼了几十个钟头，费了五吨多煤，几十个人工，停下来就白费了，而且影响这个月任务的完成……”他立即和其他工人研究对策。老工人冯明雨提出了热补的办法。董福生看看想不出更好的办法，就毫不犹豫地决定自己带头热补。这件事情的结果就是大家都知道的，在抗美援朝运动中，董福生小组冒着一千多度高温热补反射炉的英雄事迹。
    一九五二年，“三反”运动在这个工厂开展了。这个厂里很多管理人员是资产阶级的代理人，曾大量贪污和盗窃国家财富。党号召工人群众打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻，自己起来当家作主。当时，不少工人被提拔起来负责车间和科室工作，董福生被提拔为昆明电工厂副厂长。董福生当时想：一个厂那么大，不说管生产，就是管吃饭也不容易，一个工人那里管得来呢？这时，军事代表王心良就召集所有新提拔起来的工人干部开会，告诉大家说：“我们成天说工人当家做主，现在就是看我们工人能不能当家做主的时候了。如果让贪污分子来做主，我们辛辛苦苦为国家积累的钱，就进了他们的腰包，我们就实际上还没有作好主人。”这以后，董福生坚强起来，负起领导全厂生产的责任，天天和新提拔的工人干部商量事情，下车间听取工人的意见。他们都不熟悉业务，都感到工作困难。董福生说：“不管怎么困难，比贪污分子管事总要好多了，我们不懂就依靠党和群众，虚心学习，不管好工厂怎么对得起共产党。”当时，差不多所有的工人干部都有这样的决心。董福生整天考虑各种问题，深夜两三点钟了，他还支持着工作。就这样，他在“三反”期间锻炼了自己做主人的能力和意志。
    由于忠心工人阶级的事业，在这年“五一”前夕，他光荣地加入了中国共产党。
    一九五三年，国家开始了有计划的经济建设。当时，昆明电工厂职工人数增加了四、五倍。随着经济建设的发展，原昆明电工厂分为昆明冶炼厂和昆明电线厂两个工厂。董福生被分配在昆明冶炼厂担任副厂长。他原来所在的熔炼车间的工人增加了好几倍，原有的老工人都成了干部，负责车间生产。分厂不久，在一块新辟的田野上盖起了一排排的工人宿舍，在宿舍旁边，新盖的公共洗澡室、理发室、合作社等随着开放。这些发展的景象使他看到工人阶级的前途和力量，看到工人阶级的幸福生活。他这时只恨自己懂得的东西太少，不能适应这种情况，正在这期间，组织上决定送他到中共云南省委党校去学习，以提高他的政策思想水平和社会主义觉悟。
    在党校学习党在过渡时期的总路线的时候，董福生恍然感到自己过去存在过一些不符合总路线要求的东西。他说：“在我国建设社会主义社会，就要实现国家的社会主义工业化。现有企业担负着出钱、出人、出产品的任务；作为一个党的干部，我应该提高自己的水平，把自己锻炼成为国家有用的干部。”这样，他下决心要学会科学的工厂管理工作。他从党校回到工厂，随即又参加全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团到边疆去慰问中国人民解放军。到边疆，他和英雄、模范们在一起，受到了深刻的爱国主义教育。解放军战士们什么工具也没有，什么现成的材料也找不着，可是，他们创造了工具，把曾经被敌人蹂躏的边疆建设得非常美丽，用双手盖起一排排崭新的房屋。在这次慰问中，人民解放军的英雄模范行为，更加鼓舞了他的建设社会主义社会的热情，增加了他克服困难的决心。
    董福生回到厂里，觉得厂里的一切都变了。除了一排排新宿舍外，他所在的反射炉，从一个炉子经常炼铜到两个炉子同时炼，并且又建设了第三个炉子；鼓风炉改建了，上料变成机械操作；原来的一个车间，现在改成三个车间了……！这一切给他一种新的感觉，新的鼓舞；但是也给他的工作带来新的困难。他初回到厂长室时，看不懂生产日报表，有些新的管理生产的办法，都得从头学起。这时，党总支委员会决定他负责全厂的生产，管理五个车间，虽然他勇敢地担当了，不过一天忙得顾了这里又顾不了那里。
    他把这情况告诉给薛祖佑副厂长，取得薛祖佑的帮助。薛副厂长是厂里的总支委员，管理生产的时间比他长，业务熟悉。在薛副厂长的帮助下，他自己又能辛勤地学习，渐渐地学会了看报表，学会了分析问题和适当地解决问题的方法。每天上午，董福生总是先下车间了解情况。他和工人的关系素来好，所以工人都愿主动找他谈问题。他了解全厂的生产情况后，就回厂长室和薛副厂长商量解决这天新出现的问题的办法。他就凭依靠群众，虚心学习两条基本原则，学会了掌握比较现代化的管理方法。
    在他初步学会管理生产后，便有时间对车间主任一级干部进行切实具体的领导了。阴极炉车间主任杨品中原来是个工人，担任车间领导后，不知道如何工作。出了问题不能冷静地考虑产生的原因，只是亲手去干活，又抓不住主要问题，因此，电铜锭废品多的情况长久没有改变。董福生看破了他领导思想上的毛病，就把自己的体会告诉他。并对他说：“你们车间的废品多，从各方面讲都是个主要问题，你应该经常考虑如何解决这个问题。不依靠群众，不动脑筋，还解决得了？你一个人又不能包着干。”不久，他发现金学义班的废品很少，操作上有特点，就帮助总结经验，并且指示车间主任等领导开生产会议，交流经验。群众接受先进的操作方法后，废品减少了。车间主任也学会了领导车间的方法。
    四年多以来，董福生和其他工人一起在前进着，他们在党的各项事业中，通过自己切身体会，感到自己在国家中的主人翁地位，和他们对国家应负的责任；他们也通过切身体会看到工人阶级个人利益和国家利益的一致。现在，在社会主义的远景的鼓舞下，他们正在用自己的双手，用自己辛勤的劳动在管理自己的工厂，建设自己的国家。省人民代表大会召开的前夕，我访问了董福生和他的选民。他们向我介绍了这些情况。他的选民金学义等还说：“董福生一心给我们办事，不骄傲自满，在他成为劳动模范和副厂长后，更加关心群众，虚心听取我们的意见，我们都相信他可以代表我们的意见，办好国家大事。”现在他又被选为全国人民代表大会的代表，表示了人民对他更大的信任。
