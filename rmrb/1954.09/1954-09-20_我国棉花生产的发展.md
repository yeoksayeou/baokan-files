    The Development of Cotton Production in Our Country
    Yang Xiandong, Vice Minister of Agriculture, Central People's Government

    China is one of the most suitable countries in the world for growing cotton, with a long history of cotton cultivation and rich cultivation experience. However, before liberation, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the laboring people suffered cruel oppression, the cotton market was controlled by bureaucratic comprador classes, and the sales and prices of cotton were not guaranteed. Cotton farmers were subjected to relentless plunder and exploitation. Therefore, domestic cotton production never received the development it deserved. Especially after the start of the Anti-Japanese War, cotton production decreased significantly year by year, to the extent that domestic cotton production was in a state of long-term inability to be self-sufficient, and a large amount of cotton and cotton textiles had to be imported from foreign countries every year. In the year with the most imports (1946), the imported foreign cotton was equivalent to 95 percent of the total domestic cotton production that year. This situation fully demonstrates that under a semi-colonial and semi-feudal social system, production development will be subject to various obstacles.

    Cotton Production and Quality Have Both Improved

    After the founding of New China, the People's Government, in accordance with the needs of national construction and people's lives, vigorously developed cotton production in a planned way. The unreasonable phenomenon of long-term reliance on large amounts of foreign cotton imports in history was quickly reversed in New China. In 1952, the domestically produced cotton could not only fully supply the raw materials necessary for the national textile industry and meet the clothing needs of the vast majority of people, but also have a surplus for necessary reserves. The cotton production of that year increased by more than half compared to the average production of the five years with the highest production in old China (1933-1937). If the total cotton production in 1949, when the country was just liberated, is taken as 100, it increased to 160 in 1950, 235 in 1951, and 291 in 1952; the production increased nearly two times in three years. In 1953, due to the state's conscious effort to prevent excessive expansion of cotton fields, coupled with disasters in many cotton-producing areas that year, production was somewhat affected, but the total national cotton production was still 265 percent of that in 1949. The national cotton planting area has rapidly increased according to the national plan. In recent years, the cotton field area has more than doubled compared with before liberation. The unit yield of cotton fields has also gradually increased. Based on the level of 1949, it increased by 44.4 percent in the three years up to 1952. The enthusiasm and creativity of the liberated laboring people in tapping production potential is unimaginable in the past. In the past, it was extremely rare for each mu of cotton field to produce 300 to 400 jin of seed cotton, but now it is very common for general farms and advanced farmers to produce 300 to 400 jin of seed cotton per mu. In recent years, high-yield records have been continuously created: in 1951, Qu Yaoli from Xie County, Shanxi, produced 912 jin per mu; in 1952, the Wu Chun'an Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yicheng County, Shanxi, produced more than 1,021 jin per mu; in 1953, the yield per mu of some cotton fields in the military reclamation farm in the Manas River Basin in Xinjiang reached 1,349 jin.

    The quality of cotton has also improved significantly. In 1950, long-staple cotton that could spin fine yarn only accounted for 6.8 percent of the total cotton production, but in 1953 it rose to 59.73 percent; the average fiber length of the cotton produced in 1953 increased by 2.6 mm compared with 1950. The serious bad habits of adulterating cotton with water and impurities that had existed for a long time in the old society were corrected in a short period of two or three years after liberation due to the increased awareness of the masses and the government's correct implementation of grading and inspection work and the policy of rewarding high-quality cotton with better prices. In the past, there was never any domestically produced cotton that could be used to spin yarn of 60 counts or more, but now there is.

    Why Can Cotton Production Be Increased?

    Why has cotton production developed so rapidly in recent years? The basic reason is that under the new social system with its significant advantages after liberation, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the feudal land system was eliminated, and the vast laboring people unleashed their high level of production enthusiasm, and the long-term constrained production potential was greatly released; the state also gave farmers a lot of material and technical assistance; the development of mutual aid and cooperation organizations also played an important role in increasing production. Just to talk about the state's assistance:

    First of all, in order to reward farmers for increasing cotton production according to the national plan, the government formulated and implemented a series of policies to protect the interests of cotton farmers. For example, it announces reasonable ratios between cotton and grain prices every year before cotton planting, signs cotton pre-purchase contracts with cotton farmers, and the government guarantees purchases and ensures that cotton planting is profitable for farmers, so that farmers completely dispel the concerns left over from the past history that no one would purchase the cotton produced or that it could not be sold at a reasonable price. Although planting cotton is more profitable, the government stipulates that agricultural tax is still paid according to the standard of general grain fields, and cotton fields are allowed to be used to offset public grain; at the same time, the grain and other living materials lacking in cotton-producing areas are also guaranteed to be supplied by the government, eliminating farmers' concerns about lacking grain if they plant more cotton.

    Secondly, the government vigorously supplies cotton-producing areas with various necessary means of production, such as cotton seeds, commercial fertilizers, medicines and machinery for preventing and controlling cotton field diseases and insect pests, new-style farm tools, etc., and also issued necessary loans to help cotton farmers solve practical difficulties, providing material guarantees for expanding cotton fields and increasing cotton unit area yield according to the national plan. In the past, very little fine fertilizer was applied to cotton fields. Now, the national cotton fields apply more than one million tons of cake fertilizer and chemical fertilizer every year. In recent years, a total of more than 600,000 sprayers and dusters have been supplied to cotton-producing areas. In 1952 alone, the state supplied 79.7 million jin of agents for preventing and controlling cotton pests to cotton-producing areas; the output loss recovered due to the prevention and control of cotton diseases and insect pests in that year is estimated to be about 1.5 million dan of ginned cotton. Shijiazhuang Prefecture, Hebei Province, is a major cotton-producing area. From 1950 to the first half of 1953, this prefecture alone promoted more than 5,500 new-style walking plows. In addition, the state spent a lot of effort to build water conservancy projects and eliminate water damage, and the area of irrigated cotton fields has increased year by year. In major cotton-producing provinces such as Hebei, Shanxi, and Shaanxi, the irrigated cotton fields have reached more than one-quarter of the total cotton field area. After the completion of the Yellow River Diversion to Wei Canal Irrigation Canal in Henan Province, more than 200,000 mu of cotton fields were irrigated. According to the comparison in 1952, each mu of irrigated cotton field yielded 50 to 60 jin more seed cotton than unirrigated ones.

    Thirdly, the government has planned and organized the promotion of improved cotton varieties. Before liberation, although the work of promoting improved varieties had been carried out for many years, until 1948, the area of improved varieties was still less than 6 percent of the total cotton field area. After the founding of New China, ten upland cotton promotion varieties (all upland cotton improved varieties) were selected in major cotton-producing areas across the country, more than 100 improved variety breeding bases were established, 62 modern improved variety ginneries were established successively, and more than 310 million jin of high-quality seeds have been lent and distributed cumulatively in recent years. The masses were generally mobilized to select and retain seeds. By 1952, the improved varieties had basically reached the degree of basic popularization in the main upland cotton producing areas that were relatively concentrated. In 1953, the area of improved variety cotton fields across the country accounted for 62 percent of the total cotton field area, which was 24 times larger than the area of improved varieties in 1948. The promoted improved varieties can generally increase production by 10 to 20 percent compared with the original cotton varieties of farmers, and the ginning percentage and lint length have more significant improvements.

    Fourth, a mass technical improvement movement was launched. Each major cotton-producing area formulated guidelines for cotton planting technology according to local conditions, and found key production-increasing technical improvement measures, and vigorously organized their implementation. In recent years, the main improvement items have been deep plowing, dense planting, timely sowing, seedling protection and uniform seedling thinning, rational irrigation, appropriate pruning, reducing boll shedding and preventing excessive growth and late maturity. In the past, farmers generally used to sparsely plant upland cotton; after absorbing the advanced Soviet experience of dense planting, and through on-site experiments by many farms and labor models, it was confirmed that appropriate dense planting is the correct direction for increasing production and promoting early maturity. In recent years, various cotton-producing areas have largely increased the number of plants per mu by several hundred to more than one thousand on the basis of the original density, and have generally received significant production increase effects. For example, in Gaomi County, Shandong Province, there are a total of more than 300,000 mu of cotton fields, and the original cotton planting density was about 2,000 plants per mu. In 1952, due to the promotion of dense planting, it was increased to 2,500 to 3,000 plants per mu, and the average output of the county increased by more than 20 percent. For example, in the past, there was a widespread unscientific practice of flooding irrigation of irrigated cotton fields. In recent years, rational irrigation methods such as small water light irrigation, furrow irrigation, ditch irrigation, winter irrigation, and early spring irrigation have been summarized and promoted. In the 380,000 mu of cotton fields irrigated by the Jinghui Canal Irrigation Area in Shaanxi, the unit area yield increased by 1.4 times in 1953 compared with 1952 due to the comprehensive implementation of irrigation methods and other related technical improvements. Although some cotton-producing areas have had cotton pruning experience among the masses for a long time, in the past many people have been skeptical or negative and did not dare to advocate promotion. In recent years, from the summary of practical experience, it has been completely affirmed that pruning technology is one of the main measures to ensure cotton production increase and promote early maturity. Cotton pruning has now been widely implemented in northern cotton-producing areas; it is also gradually expanding in southern cotton-producing areas. According to the results of pruning experiments in Jingzhou Farm in Hubei Province in 1953, the yield of pruning was 21.8 percent higher than that of no pruning, and the number of frost-yellowed, stiff, and rotten flowers was 30.2 percent less. In addition, the salt reclamation area changed the habit of not daring to cultivate cotton fields; many cotton-producing areas in the south changed from broadcasting to strip planting; the cotton-wheat double-cropping system area overcame the contradictions existing in double-cropping cultivation and strived to increase production in both cotton and wheat seasons; and northern cotton-producing areas implemented drought-resistant farming methods to ensure timely sowing. A lot of achievements have also been made.

    Under the guidance of the Party and the government, the broad masses of farmers have taken the road of mutual aid and cooperation, gradually changing from decentralized individual operations to larger-scale collective operations, rationally using land and labor, and the superiority shown in cotton production increase is extremely significant. For example, in 1953, the average yield of seed cotton per mu of cotton fields in agricultural production cooperatives in Shanxi Province was 189 jin, which was 35.8 percent higher than the average output of the province.

    In recent years, the many state-owned farms established by the state have achieved more significant results in increasing production due to the implementation of mechanical farming on a large area and the adoption of scientific production technology and management systems. For example, in 1953, the average yield of ginned cotton per mu on more than 60,000 mu of cotton fields produced by state-owned farms and farms produced by troops in Xinjiang Province was 72.3 jin, which was more than twice the average output of the province. The average output of the state-owned Wulidian, Zhanghua, and Heyi farms in the suburbs of Beijing in 1953 was also about 50 percent higher than the average output of farmers. The large-scale operation and advanced production methods of state-owned farms have become a clear banner guiding the broad masses of farmers to organize and adopt new technologies to develop production.

    We Must Continue to Work Hard to Increase Cotton Production

    In the first Five-Year Plan, the state decided that the textile industry should continue to develop on its original basis. The living standards of the laboring people are rapidly improving, and the consumption of cotton and cotton cloth has also increased significantly. For example, the consumption of cotton cloth in Northeast China has increased more than 13 times in the five years after liberation. In recent years, our country has greatly developed cotton production, basically meeting domestic supply. In the future, with the development of the national textile industry and the increasing needs of the people for cotton and cotton cloth, we must continue to increase cotton production in a planned way. Before the complete realization of national industrialization and agricultural collectivization, it is of course quite difficult to greatly increase cotton production, and it is difficult to catch up with the growth rate of people's needs for cotton and cotton cloth. Therefore, it is necessary to implement planned supply of cotton cloth and planned purchase of cotton. However, the fundamental way to continuously meet the needs of the people is to continuously develop production. Agricultural workers and cotton farmers must recognize their important responsibility for further increasing cotton production. China's cotton production has great potential, and the prospects for development are limitless. Since the founding of New China, the broad masses of agricultural science and technology workers have also been freed from the situation of being in a small circle where their work was not valued and they could not play a role. In recent years, agricultural science institutions and agricultural experiment stations have been reorganized and enriched, scientific and technical personnel have been respected, and their ideological and professional levels have been improved with the help of the government, so they can closely cooperate with the needs of the country and exert the power of science and technology, not only helping to solve the main problems in current production, but also opening up new and broad roads for the continued development of production in the future. In the past, it was generally believed that the northernmost boundary of China's cotton-producing area could not exceed 42 or 3 degrees north latitude, but now the cotton-producing area has been advanced to 46 or 7 degrees north latitude in Heilongjiang Province. Xinjiang and coastal reclamation areas have a large amount of new cotton land that can be developed. The East China Agricultural Science Institute has used sexual and asexual hybridization methods to select and breed long-staple cotton that can be used for special industries with a lint length of up to one and a half inches. In addition, long-staple Sea Island cotton has also been initially introduced successfully in our country. Our agricultural cooperation and mechanization are developing day by day, and the scientific technology and mechanized farming experience for increasing cotton production are constantly being created and developed. Under China's superior political and economic system, human and material resources can fully play a role that is beneficial to production; in addition, China's natural conditions are superior. As long as we continue to work hard, we have the conditions to produce more and better cotton on the existing basis.

    我国棉花生产的发展
    中央人民政府农业部副部长　杨显东
    中国是世界上最适宜种棉花的国家之一，具有长远的种棉历史和丰富的栽培经验。可是，解放以前，在国民党反动统治之下，劳动人民受到残酷的压迫，棉花市场掌握在官僚买办阶级手里，棉花的销路和价格没有保证，棉农受到无情的掠夺和剥削。因此，国内的棉花生产，一直得不到应有的发展。尤其抗日战争开始以后，棉花产量更逐年大量缩减，以致国内棉花生产长期处在不能自给自足的状态，每年要从国外进口大量棉花和棉织品。进口最多的一年（一九四六年），输入的外国棉花，竟相当于当年国内棉花总产量的百分之九十五。这种情况，充分表明了在半殖民地、半封建的社会制度下，生产的发展是要受到种种阻碍的。
    棉花产量质量都提高了
    新中国成立以后，人民政府就按照国家建设和人民生活的需要，有计划地大力发展棉花生产。历史上长期依赖大量外国棉花进口的不合理现象，在新中国很快就转变了。一九五二年，国内生产的棉花，不仅完全能供应全国纺织工业所必需的原料和满足广大人民的衣着需要，而且还可以多余一部分作为必要的储备。这一年的棉花产量，比起旧中国生产最多的五年（一九三三——一九三七年）的平均产量，已增加一半以上。如果以全国刚解放时一九四九年的棉花总产量为一○○，一九五○年增加到一六○，一九五一年增加到二三五，一九五二年增加到二九一；三年内增加产量近两倍。一九五三年由于国家有意识地不让棉田过分扩展，加以这一年不少棉区受灾，产量受到一些影响，但全国棉花总产量仍为一九四九年的百分之二六五。全国的植棉面积，按照国家计划迅速扩增，几年来棉田面积已较解放前扩增一倍以上。棉田单位产量也逐步提高，如以一九四九年的水平为基础，至一九五二年，三年内就提高了百分之四十四点四。翻身后的劳动人民发掘生产潜力的积极性和创造性是过去所难以想像的。过去每亩棉田产三、四百斤籽棉的极为稀罕，而现在一般农场和先进的农民每亩生产三、四百斤籽棉已是极平常的事。几年来，并且不断创造了高额的丰产纪录：一九五一年山西解县曲耀离每亩产九百一十二斤；一九五二年山西翼城县吴春安农业生产合作社每亩产一千零二十一斤多；一九五三年新疆玛纳斯河流域军垦农场的一部分棉田每亩产量达到一千三百四十九斤。
    棉花的品质也有显著的改进。一九五○年所产能纺细纱的长绒原棉仅占全部棉产量的百分之六·八，一九五三年就上升到百分之五十九·七三；一九五三年所生产的棉花，平均纤维长度较一九五○年增加了二·六公厘。旧社会长期存在的在棉花中搀水搀杂的严重恶习，解放后由于广大群众觉悟的提高，加以政府正确地贯彻了分级检验工作和优棉优价政策，在短短两三年内就纠正了。过去国产棉花中从来没有能供纺六十支以上细纱的，现在也有了。
    棉花生产为什么能提高
    为什么这几年来棉花生产能这样快地发展呢？基本的原因是解放后在具有显著优越性的新的社会制度下，在共产党和人民政府的正确领导下，消灭了封建的土地制度，广大的劳动人民发挥了高度的生产积极性，长期被束缚着的生产潜力大量解放出来了；国家还给了农民许多物质上技术上的帮助；互助合作组织的发展，对于产量的提高也有重要的作用。只就国家的帮助来谈：
    首先，政府为了奖励农民按国家计划增产棉花，制订和执行了一系列保障棉农利益的政策。如每年在棉花播种以前公布棉花和粮食的合理比价，与棉农订立棉花预购合同，政府保证收购，而且保证种棉花对农民有利，使农民完全打消了过去历史上遗留下来的怕生产出来棉花没有人收购或卖不到合理价格的顾虑。种植棉花虽收益较多，但政府规定仍按一般粮田的标准缴纳农业税，并准许棉田用棉花来抵交公粮；同时，产棉区所缺少的粮食和其他生活资料，也由政府保证调剂供应，免除了农民怕多种了棉花缺粮食吃的顾虑。
    其次，政府大力供应棉区各种必需的生产资料，如棉种、商品肥料、防治棉田病虫的药械、新式农具等，并且发放了必要的贷款，帮助棉农解决实际困难，为按照国家计划扩大棉田和提高棉花单位面积产量，提供了物质上的保证。过去棉田施用细肥的很少，现在全国棉田每年施用饼类肥料和化学肥料已达一百万吨以上。几年来供应棉区的喷雾器和喷粉器，共有六十多万架。只一九五二年，国家供应棉区防治棉花害虫的药剂就有七千九百多万斤；这一年因防治棉花病虫害而挽回的产量损失，估计约有一百五十多万担皮棉。河北省石家庄专区是一个主要产棉区，自一九五○年至一九五三年上半年，仅这一个专区就推广了新式步犁五千五百多架。另外，国家用了很大的力量兴修水利和排除水害，灌溉棉田的面积逐年增加。河北、山西、陕西等主要产棉省份，灌溉棉田已达到棉田总面积的四分之一以上。河南省引黄济卫灌溉渠修好后，灌溉棉田二十多万亩，根据一九五二年的对比，灌溉的棉田比不灌溉的每亩多收籽棉五十到六十斤。
    第三，政府有计划有组织地推广了改良棉种。解放以前，推广改良种工作虽已进行了多年，但直到一九四八年，良种面积仍不到棉田总面积的百分之六。新中国成立后，在全国主要棉区选定了十个细绒棉推广种（都是陆地棉改良种），设置了一百多处良种繁殖基地，先后建立了六十二所近代化的良种轧花厂，几年来累计贷发出优良种子三亿一千多万斤，并普遍发动群众进行选种留种工作。到了一九五二年，凡比较集中的主要细绒棉产区，良种都已达到基本普及的程度。一九五三年全国良种棉田面积占棉田总面积的百分之六十二，比一九四八年的良种面积扩大了二十四倍。推广的良种，一般可较农民原来的棉种增加产量百分之十至二十，衣分、绒长等更有显著的提高。
    第四，开展了群众性的技术改良运动。各主要棉区都因地制宜地制订了植棉技术指导纲要，并找出关键性的增产技术改进措施，大力组织推行。几年来，主要的改进项目是深耕、密植、及时播种、保苗匀苗、合理灌溉、适当整枝、减少蕾铃脱落和防止徒长晚熟等。过去农民对细绒棉一般习惯稀植；经吸取苏联先进的密植经验，通过许多农场和劳动模范的实地试验，证实了适当密植是增加产量提早成熟的正确方向。几年来，各个棉区已大部在原来密度基础上每亩增加了几百株到一千多株，一般都收到显著的增产效果。如山东省高密县共有三十多万亩棉田，原来植棉密度每亩约二千株左右，一九五二年因推行密植，每亩加到二千五百至三千株，全县平均产量提高了二成以上。又如，灌溉棉田过去普遍存在着大水漫浇的不科学的做法，几年来已总结推行了小水轻浇、畦灌、沟灌、实行冬灌、提早春灌等合理灌溉的办法。陕西泾惠渠灌溉棉区三十八万多亩棉田，一九五三年由于全面实施了灌溉方法和其他有关技术的改进，较一九五二年提高了单位面积产量一点四倍。虽然部分棉区群众中早就有棉花整枝经验，但过去许多人一直抱怀疑或否定的态度，不敢提倡推广。几年来，从总结实践经验中，已完全肯定了整枝技术是保证棉花增产促进早熟的主要措施之一。北方棉区现已广泛实施棉花整枝；南方棉区也在逐步扩大推行。湖北省荆州农场一九五三年整枝试验的结果，实施整枝的比不整枝的产量高百分之二十一点八，霜黄僵烂花少百分之三十点二。另外，盐垦区改变棉田不敢耕地的习惯；南方许多棉区改撒播为条播；棉麦两熟制地区克服两熟栽培中存在的矛盾，争取棉麦两季增产；北方棉区实施抗旱耕作法，保证及时播种等，也都做出许多成绩。
    广大农民在党和政府的指导下，走互助合作的道路，由分散的个体经营，逐步改变为较大规模的集体经营，合理地使用土地和劳动力，在棉花增产方面所表现出的优越性是极为显著的。如山西省一九五三年全省农业生产合作社的棉田，平均每亩产籽棉一百八十九斤，高出全省平均产量百分之三十五点八。
    几年来国家设置的许多国营农场，由于在大面积上实施机械耕作和采用科学的生产技术和经营管理制度，增产的成绩更为显著。如一九五三年新疆全省国营农场和部队生产的农场，在六万多亩棉田上，平均每亩产皮棉七十二点三斤，超过全省平均产量一倍多。北京郊区的国营五里店、彰化、和义等农场，一九五三年共种五千零二十五亩棉花，平均产量也高于农民平均产量百分之五十左右。国营农场大规模的经营和先进的生产方法，已成为引导广大农民组织起来采用新技术发展生产的鲜明旗帜。
    必须继续努力提高棉花产量
    在第一个五年计划内，国家决定纺织工业要在原有基础上继续发展。劳动人民生活水平迅速提高，对棉花和棉布的消费量也显著地增加。如东北棉布的消费量，解放后五年以内，就增加了十三倍多。几年来，我们国家大量发展了棉花生产，基本上满足了国内的供应。今后，随着国家纺织工业的发展和人民对棉花棉布日益增长的需要，我们还要有计划地继续增加棉花的生产量。在国家工业化、农业合作化没有完全实现以前，要大大提高棉花的产量当然是相当困难的，是很难赶上人民对于棉花棉布的需要增长的速度的。因此，不能不实行棉布计划供应、棉花计划收购。但是，不断满足人民需要的根本办法还是不断发展生产。农业工作者和棉农一定要认识自己对于进一步增产棉花的重要责任。中国的棉花生产有着极大的潜力，发展前途是无可限量的。自从新中国成立后，广大的农业科学技术工作者，也都从过去那种工作不受重视、陷在小圈子里发挥不了作用的局面中解脱出来了。几年来，农业科学机关和农业试验场经过整理和充实，科学技术人员受到尊重，并在政府帮助下提高了思想水平和业务水平，因而能密切地配合国家的需要，发挥出科学技术方面的力量，不仅帮助解决当前生产上的主要问题，并给今后继续发展生产开辟了新的广阔的道路。过去一般认为我国棉区最北的界限不能超过北纬四十二、三度，而现在棉区已推进到黑龙江省北纬四十六、七度的地方。新疆、沿海垦区有着大量可以开发的新棉地。华东农业科学研究所运用有性、无性杂交的方法，已选育出绒长达一又二分之一吋的能供特种工业用的长绒原棉。另外，长绒的海岛棉也已在我国初步引种成功，我国农业合作化、机械化的事业正在日益发展，增产棉花的科学技术和机耕经验都正在不断创造发展中。在我国的优越的政治经济制度下，人力物力都可以充分发挥出对生产有利的作用；加以我国自然条件的优厚，只要我们不断努力，完全有条件在现有基础上生产出更多更好的棉花。
