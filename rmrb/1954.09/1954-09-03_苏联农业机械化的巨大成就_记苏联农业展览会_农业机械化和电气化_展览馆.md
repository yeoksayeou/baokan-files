    The Tremendous Achievements of Soviet Agricultural Mechanization
    ——On the "Agricultural Mechanization and Electrification" Exhibition Hall at the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition
    By our correspondent Li He

    While visiting here, one cannot help but think of Maltsev's new cultivation method exhibited in the "Urals" and "Grain" halls. Many collective farms in the Kurgan region have adopted this method and achieved stable, high yields. This cultivation method requires deep plowing of forty to sixty centimeters deep in the first year, and only loosening of the soil for the next three or four years. Currently in the Soviet Union, many places are promoting the Maltsev cultivation method. The Ural factory is manufacturing no-moldboard plows and claw harrows for this type of cultivation.
    Alongside the plows and harrows are various seeders and fertilizer spreaders, pulled or suspended by tractors. Practice and science have proven that close-row dense planting of grains can increase yields by 10 to 15 percent compared to normal planting. There is a close-row seeder that can sow forty-eight rows with a row spacing of 7.5 centimeters, a sowing width of 3.6 meters, and a seed depth of 3.7 centimeters, sowing 1.6 to 2 hectares per hour. There is a seeder that applies fertilizer through its front tubes and then sows seeds through the rear tubes. There is a seeder that can sow grain seeds into the soil at a depth of 3 to 7 centimeters while simultaneously sowing pasture seeds into the soil at a depth of 2 to 4 centimeters. Intertilled crops such as corn and sunflowers are increasingly using the square-cluster planting method. The advantage of this advanced method lies in the ease of using machines to cultivate the crops vertically and horizontally in a square pattern, saving labor and increasing yields. Each hectare can yield 8,000 kilograms of corn (40,000 to 50,000 kilograms of green corn stalks). There is a new type of square-cluster seeder equipped with an automatic device that can accurately cluster seeds at the four corners of a square with a row spacing of 60, 65, or 70 centimeters, sowing 1.3 hectares per hour.
    On the second tier of the long platform to the right are various threshing machines, grain cleaning machines, and grain drying machines. One type of threshing machine, when connected to a 22- to 24-horsepower generator, can thresh and clean 1.5 to 2 tons of grain per hour. Threshing machines and drying machines are used in areas where it is inconvenient to use combine harvesters, and also to supplement the cleaning and drying after harvesting with combine harvesters. Transporting grain from the fields, unloading it, processing it, and then transporting it away is very labor-intensive, costing twice as much labor as plowing, sowing, and harvesting. Therefore, the development of fully mechanized threshing yards, linking grain processing machines together, is taking place. There, the harvested grain is cleaned, dried, sorted, and transported without manual labor. From 1951 to 1953, machine tractor stations in the Krasnodar Krai installed 3,884 mechanized threshing yards for various collective farms. It is estimated that when this type of mechanized threshing yard is universally established throughout the Soviet Union, it will save 300 million workdays (equivalent to 10 million people working for one month), just as the introduction of combine harvesters did.
    Adjacent to the grain processing machines are machines for mowing, stacking hay, and building haystacks. There is a self-propelled mower that can mow a width of 10 meters, mowing 6 hectares per hour. There is a hay-stacking machine with claws that can lift a haystack weighing 150 kilograms at once.
    Next are machines for reclaiming new land. Many machines in various parts of the exhibition hall have signs indicating that they are for supplying the reclamation of new land. In recent years, the Soviet Union has manufactured many shrub cutters, root diggers, double-furrow plows for swampy land where shrubs grow, heavy-duty disc harrows, and so on. Using these machines increases labor productivity in reclaiming wasteland by fifty to sixty times.
    Superior machines are mastered by people. Here, there are pictures illustrating the achievements of the Bunyaev tractor team of the Malorossiysk Machine Tractor Station in the Krasnodar Krai. This hero of socialist labor is the initiator of the movement to tap potential and increase crop yields. Due to the correct organization of labor, a good understanding of machines, and the adoption of advanced technologies such as deep plowing, narrow-row and cross-row sowing, and square-cluster planting, this tractor team has consistently overfulfilled its plans well in all agricultural tasks year after year, resulting in bumper harvests of wheat, barley, corn, sunflowers, and other crops.
    On both sides and behind the domed hall, on two levels, are exhibition halls for industrial crops, horticulture, animal husbandry, combating pests and diseases, and electrification.
    Harvesting industrial crops such as cotton, sugar beets, flax, and hemp is the most laborious and difficult to mechanize, but machines are available in the Soviet Union and are constantly being improved. In the domed hall and the specialized halls for cotton, sugar beets, and hemp, these highly efficient machines are exhibited. The cotton picker, which uses steam power to suck down cotton bolls, is equipped with an engine and is used in non-irrigated areas, capable of picking 0.5 to 0.6 hectares per hour. The cotton picker, which uses vertical rollers to clamp down on cotton bolls, is pulled by a tractor and is used in irrigated areas, capable of picking 0.2 hectares per hour, replacing the labor of sixty cotton pickers. The sugar beet combine harvester, pulled by a tractor, uses iron claws on chain belts to pull out the sugar beets, cut off the beet leaves, remove the soil, and collect them into piles, capable of harvesting 0.3 hectares per hour. The flax combine harvester includes three parts: pulling, combing, and bundling. It pulls the flax out of the soil, combs off the seeds on top, and bundles the combed flax stalks, pulled by a tractor, capable of harvesting 1 hectare per hour, replacing the labor of dozens of people.
    In the potato and vegetable hall, and in the open-air area next to it, a potato combine harvester is displayed. As it moves in the field, the hoe in front of the machine digs up the potatoes. The potatoes fall onto a curtain-shaped chain belt. As the chain belt rotates, it shakes off some of the soil. The potatoes pass through the gap between two rubber air rollers, where the soil is rubbed off and the leaves are blown away by the ventilation device. The potatoes are sent to a basket behind the machine by the chain belt. When the harvester operator steps on the pedal, the basket tips out the full potatoes. This combine harvester is pulled by a tractor and can harvest 0.35 hectares of potatoes per hour. In the domed hall, there is also a specialized harvester for square-cluster planted potatoes, which can harvest 0.48 hectares per hour.
    The progress of mechanization in potato and vegetable production is very significant. This year, the square-cluster planting method for potatoes and vegetables is widely used in Soviet rural areas, and peat-humus nutrient pots are widely used to cultivate vegetable seedlings. The hall has a machine that square-cluster plants potatoes while simultaneously fertilizing the cluster holes, capable of planting 0.6 to 0.8 hectares per hour. There is a lathe for manufacturing peat-humus nutrient pots, which mixes peat-humus soil and can press out eight to nine thousand nutrient pots per hour. There is a machine that square-cluster plants seedlings grown in nutrient pots while simultaneously watering the planting area, capable of planting 0.22 hectares per hour. There are mobile artificial rain sprinklers, which do not require ditching, increase labor productivity by eight to nine times compared to ditch irrigation, and consume one-half to two-thirds less water. Many collective farms in the Moscow region, pulling artificial rain sprinklers with tractors, irrigate eight, nine, or ten hectares of vegetable fields a day.
    Almost all of the laborious work in livestock farms has been mechanized. The hall exhibits various machines for washing, chopping, and steaming feed, as well as milking machines and sheep shearing machines. There is a machine for steaming potatoes or green fodder for feeding cattle, which steams well in twenty to twenty-five minutes, steaming one ton per hour. There is a machine for preparing feed for feeding cattle and pigs, which can wash, cut, transport, and steam root crops such as potatoes, and can also mix steamed or unsteamed root crops with other selected feed, preparing 460 kilograms of feed per hour. Currently, advanced collective farms and state farms are establishing summer cattle farms in the fields, and mobile milking devices have been manufactured for this purpose, equipped with ten milking machines, enough for one hundred cows.
    The effect of using machines to combat crop pests and diseases is astonishing. The hall displays a spraying machine. In 1952, the Soviet countryside increased a large number of these machines. Pulled by a tractor, it can spray liquid medicine 15 meters high or spray powder 20 meters high, spraying 50 liters per minute. Spraying medicine on 100 hectares of cotton fields requires 75 workdays using manual sprayers, only 6 workdays using this sprayer, and only 2.5 workdays by airplane. Airplanes are also exhibited here. It is widely used in the Soviet Union to spread powder and also to apply fertilizer. Its belly has a special device. Using airplanes to spread medicine to eliminate weeds can increase the yield of grain by two to three hundred kilograms per hectare and is twenty times less labor-intensive than manual weeding.
    The continuous improvement of agricultural mechanization production and rural cultural life requires more and more electricity. The machines and pictures in the exhibition hall tell us about the leapfrog development of agricultural electrification in the Soviet Union. Not counting the power supplied by the powerful industrial power grid, Soviet rural power stations had more than 1.5 million kilowatts of generating capacity in 1953. By the beginning of 1953, approximately 20,000 collective farms, 90 percent of state farms, and 95 percent of machine tractor stations in the Soviet Union had been electrified.
    The "XTZ-12" electric tractor, demonstrated in the electricity hall, shows the unlimited prospects of using electricity in agricultural production. Equipped with a 38-kilowatt engine, it only costs 45 kilowatt-hours of electricity to plow one hectare of land, saving 20 tons of fuel per year. In 1952, it did twenty kinds of work such as plowing, sowing, and hauling timber. From 1949 to 1953, four tractor stations in the Ryazan Oblast, Cherkasy Oblast, Sverdlovsk Oblast, and Stavropol Krai plowed 77,500 hectares of land using electric tractors (all tasks converted into plowing work).
    From water turbines to engines, mobile power stations, radio dispatch stations, radio receivers, and televisions, all the electrical machines that guarantee rural prosperity are on display in front of us. The Ilich Collective Farm in the Lenin District of the Moscow Oblast, following Lenin's initiative, installed electric lights in 1921. Now it has thirty-eight generators, with a total generating capacity of 298 kilowatts, 57 percent of which is used for animal husbandry, 26 percent for field crops, and 17 percent for repair shops. As a result, it saves 66,800 workdays and the labor of 22,000 horses doing a day's work each year, and 50 tons of kerosene.
    In 1953, all Soviet agriculture saved approximately 35 million workdays and the labor of 11 million horses doing a day's work due to the use of electricity.
      The "Agricultural Mechanization and Electrification" exhibition hall and the open-air areas of many other exhibition halls also exhibit many machines. Many of them are too large to fit indoors.
    The Soviet people's relentless efforts to develop agricultural mechanization and continuously improve it are endless and inexhaustible. This effort is precisely an important guarantee for implementing the resolutions of the Ninth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, further developing agriculture, and advancing towards communism.

    苏联农业机械化的巨大成就
    ——记苏联农业展览会“农业机械化和电气化”展览馆
    本报记者　李何
    在这里参观时不能不想到“乌拉尔”馆和“谷物”馆所展览的马尔采夫的新耕作法。库尔干州许多集体农庄采用这个方法，取得稳定的丰产。这个耕作方法要求第一年深耕四十到六十公分那样深，后来三、四年只要松土。现在苏联，许多地方在推广马尔采夫耕作法。乌拉尔工厂在制造这种耕作时用的无铧板的犁和爪形耙。
    和犁、耙并列着用拖拉机牵引或吊挂的各式播种机、施肥机。实践和科学证明：窄距密植谷物可以比平常提高百分之十到十五的收成。有一种窄距播种机能播四十八行，行距七点五公分，播种面宽三点六公尺，种子入土三点七公分，一小时播一点六到二公顷。有一种播种机，它的前管施肥料，后管接着就下种籽。有一种播种机能把谷物种籽播入泥土三到七公分，同时把牧草种籽播入泥土二到四公分。玉米、向日葵等中耕作物，越来越多地采用方形簇种法。这种先进方法的好处在于便于用机器在方格形作物中纵横中耕，节省劳动，提高收获量。每公顷可收玉米八千公斤（青玉蜀黍四、五万公斤）。有一种新式方形簇种机，装置有自动器，能够准确地在行距六十、六十五或七十公分的方格四角上簇种，一小时播一点三公顷。
    右边第二层长台陈放着各式打谷机、清谷机、烘谷机。有一种打谷机接上二十二到二十四马力的发电机，一小时能打谷和清谷一点五到两吨。打谷机、烘谷机使用在不便使用联合收割机的地方，和用联合机收割以后还要补充清和烘的地方。把谷物从田地运来，卸下，加工以后再运走，这是很费劳动的。所费的劳动为犁耕、播种和收割的劳动的两倍。所以发展着全盘机械化的打谷场，把谷物加工机器联接在一起。收割后的谷物在那里清、烘和分类、装运都不用人工。克拉斯诺达尔边疆区的机器拖拉机站从一九五一年到一九五三年为各集体农庄安装了三千八百八十四个机械化打谷场。据计算，这类机械化打谷场在全苏联普遍设立时，将像出现联合收割机一样又节省三万万个工（即一千万人工作一个月）。
    和谷物加工机器毗连的是刈草、堆草和起草堆的机器。有一种自动行走的刈草机、能刈十公尺宽，一小时刈六公顷。有一种起草堆机，它的爪一下子能吊起一百五十公斤重的草堆。
    接着是开垦新地用的机器。展览馆各部分许多机器挂有字牌，说明是供给开垦新地用的。最近几年苏联制造了许多砍灌木机、挖树根机、在生长灌木的泥沼地上用的双铧犁、重型圆盘耙等等。使用这些机器，把开垦荒地的劳动生产率提高五六十倍。
    优越的机器是靠人来掌握的。在这里有图片说明克拉斯诺达尔边疆区马洛露西机器拖拉机站布涅也夫拖拉机队的成就。这位社会主义劳动英雄是发挥潜力来提高农作物收获量运动的发起人。由于正确组织劳动，很好知道机器，采用深耕、窄距和交叉播种、方形簇种等等先进技术，这个拖拉机队在一切农作方面年年超额地很好地完成计划，因而小麦、大麦、玉米、向日葵等等作物年年丰产。
    在圆顶大厅两边和背后两层分设着技术作物、园艺、饲畜、与病虫害作斗争、电气化等展览厅。
    棉、甜菜、亚麻和大麻这些技术作物的收割是最费力、最难机械化的，但在苏联都有机器，而且机器在不断改进中。在圆顶大厅和棉、甜菜、麻各个专门厅，都展览着这些效率很高的机器。以汽力吸下棉桃的采棉机，配备有发动机，用在非灌溉区，一小时能采零点五到零点六公顷。以垂直滚轴夹下棉桃的采棉机，由拖拉机牵引，用在灌溉区，一小时能采零点二公顷，代替六十个采棉人的劳动。由拖拉机牵引的甜菜联合收割机，用链带上的铁爪拔出甜菜，切去菜叶，清掉泥土和收集成堆，每小时能收割零点三公顷。亚麻联合收割机包括拔、梳、束三部分装置，把亚麻拔出土，梳掉头上的籽，把梳后的亚麻秸束成捆，由拖拉机牵引，一小时能收割一公顷，代替几十个人的劳动。
    在马铃薯和蔬菜厅，旁边的露天场子上，摆着一种马铃薯联合收割机。它在田间行进时，机前镢头掘出马铃薯。马铃薯落进帘子形的链带上。链带旋转时把土抖掉一部分。马铃薯经过两个橡皮气滚夹缝，土被揉掉，叶子被通风装置吹掉。马铃薯被链带送到机后篮子去。收割机手一踩踏板，篮子便倒出装满的马铃薯。这种联合收割机用拖拉机牵引，一小时能收零点三五公顷马铃薯。在圆顶大厅还展览一种专门收方形簇种的马铃薯的，一小时能收零点四八公顷。
    马铃薯和蔬菜生产机械化的进步是很显著的。今年苏联农村广泛地采用方形簇种方法播种马铃薯和蔬菜，广泛采用泥炭腐植质的营养皿来培植菜秧。厅内有方形簇种马铃薯同时向簇穴施肥的机器，一小时能种零点六到零点八公顷。有制造泥炭腐植质营养皿的车床，它混合搅拌泥炭腐植质土，一小时能压出八、九千块营养皿。有把长在营养皿中的秧苗方形簇种同时向种下地方浇水的机器，一小时能种零点二二公顷。有活动的人造雨喷射器，不用开渠，比水渠灌溉劳动生产率提高八、九倍，少耗水二分之一到三分之二。莫斯科州许多集体农庄，用拖拉机拉着人造雨喷射器，一天灌溉了八、九、十公顷菜地。
    饲畜场的费力劳动差不多都机械化了。厅内展览着各式洗濯、切碎、蒸煮饲料的机器，挤牛奶器，剪羊毛器。有一种蒸煮喂牛的马铃薯或青饲料的机器，二十到二十五分钟蒸好，一小时蒸一吨。有一种准备喂牛喂猪的饲料的机器，能洗、切、运、蒸马铃薯之类根块，同时能把蒸熟或未蒸的根块与其他精选饲料混合，一小时准备好四百六十公斤饲料。现在先进的集体农庄和国营农场都在野外设立夏令饲牛场，为此又制造了活动的挤牛奶装置，配备十个挤牛奶器，够一百头母牛用。
    用机器和作物的病虫害作斗争，它的效果是惊人的。厅内陈列一种药剂喷射器。一九五二年苏联农村增加了大批这种机器。它由拖拉机牵引，能喷射药液十五公尺高或药粉二十公尺高，一分钟喷射五十公升。在一百公顷的棉田上喷药，用手工喷射器需要七十五个工，用这种喷射器只要六个工，用飞机只要二点五个工。这里也展览着飞机。它在苏联被广泛地用来撒药粉，也用来施肥料。它的腹部有专门的装置。用飞机撒药消灭野草，每公顷土地可以多收二、三百公斤谷物，并且比人工除草省力二十倍。
    农业机械化生产和农村文化生活的不断提高，需要越来越多的电力。展览馆的机器和图片，告诉我们苏联农业电气化飞跃发展的情景。不算强大的工业电力网的给电，苏联农村电力站在一九五三年有一百五十多万瓩发电力。到一九五三年初，苏联已有约二万个集体农庄、百分之九十的国营农场、百分之九十五的机器拖拉机站电气化了。
    在电力厅表演的“XT三——十二”电气拖拉机，显示着在农业生产中使用电力的无限前途。它配备三十八瓩发动机，犁一公顷地只花四十五瓩时电力，每年可以节省二十吨燃料。在一九五二年它做了犁耘、播种、拉木材等二十种工作。梁赞州、切尔卡斯州、斯维尔德洛夫州、斯塔甫罗波尔边疆区的四个拖拉机站，从一九四九到一九五三年期间用电力拖拉机耕了七万七千五百公顷土地（各项工作折成耕地工作计算）。
    从水力透平到发动机、流动电力站、无线电调度台、无线电收音机、电视机，一切保证农村繁荣的电力机器都摆在我们面前。莫斯科州列宁区伊里奇集体农庄，根据列宁的创议，在一九二一年装上了电灯。现在它有三十八部发电机，总共有二百九十八瓩发电力，发电力的百分之五十七用在饲畜，百分之二十六用在田间作物，百分之十七用在修理场。由此，它每年节省六万六千八百个工，和二万二千匹马做一天工作的劳动量，和五十吨煤油。
    全苏联农业在一九五三年由于使用了电力，节省了约三千五百万个工和一千一百万匹马做一天工作的劳动量。
      “农业机械化和电气化”展览馆以及其他许多展览馆的露天场子上还展览着许多机器。其中不少是庞大得在室内装不下的。
    苏联人民在发展农业机械化方面勇往直前、不断提高的努力，是看不尽，说不完的。这种努力正是实现苏共中央九月全会的决议，进一步发展农业，向共产主义迈进的重要保证。（续完）
