Zaoyang County, Hubei Province, has created a successful experience in cultivating regenerative sorghum during the production increase campaign. The county has already cultivated 280,000 mu of regenerative sorghum, accounting for 85% of the original 330,000 mu of sorghum. Liu Shiguo, a farmer from Wuliqiao Township, Yangdang District, cultivated regenerative sorghum on 1.4 mu of land and harvested 182 jin on August 29th. If the entire county's regenerative sorghum is calculated at a minimum yield of 80 jin per mu, it can increase grain production by 22.4 million jin. Currently, 50% of the county's regenerative sorghum is heading and flowering, and 30% is budding. It is expected that all of it can be harvested by the end of September.

Cultivating regenerative sorghum was one of the original production increase methods of a few farmers in Zaoyang County. It was only after the county's leading organs summarized and improved it that it was fully promoted throughout the county.

    湖北省枣阳县培育再生高粱获得成功
    湖北省枣阳县在增产运动中，创造了培育再生高粱的成功经验。该县已经培育再生高粱二十八万亩，占原种高粱三十三万亩的百分之八十五。杨壋区五里桥乡农民刘诗国在一亩四分田内培育的再生高粱，已于八月二十九日收割，产量是一百八十二斤。全县再生高粱按最低产量每亩八十斤计算，可增产二千二百四十万斤粮食。目前，该县的再生高粱已有百分之五十吐穗扬花，百分之三十怀苞。预计九月下旬，可全部收割。
    培育再生高粱是枣阳县少数农民原有的增产办法之一，经过该县领导机关总结与提高，才在该县全面推广。
