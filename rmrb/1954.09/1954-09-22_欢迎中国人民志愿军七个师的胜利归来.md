    The seven divisions of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have begun to withdraw from Korea and return to the motherland. We extend our warmest greetings and enthusiastic welcome to this heroic army of the Chinese people, our own sons and brothers.
    It has been almost four years since the Chinese People's Volunteer Army went abroad to fight. These were four years of fierce struggle between the forces of peace and the forces of war. Today, the situation in Asia and the world as a whole has undergone tremendous changes: the Korean war of resistance against aggression has been victorious, peace has been restored in Indochina, international tensions have eased, China's international standing has been raised to an unprecedented level, and the world's peace and democratic forces led by the Soviet Union have greatly developed; while the war policies and aggressive adventures of American imperialism have suffered serious setbacks, and the American war-mongering clique has fallen into unprecedented isolation. This is a great victory for the concerted struggle of all peace-loving people around the world. And the Chinese people's struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, especially the joint combat of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, has made a brilliant contribution to this great victory.
    Four years ago, when the world's most powerful and barbaric imperialist army marched to the Yalu River, when the security of the motherland and the peace of the world were under the most serious threat, the most outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation stepped forward, formed the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, bid farewell to their motherland and loved ones, left their peaceful life and work, rushed to the war-torn Korea, and together with the Korean People's Army, with unparalleled revolutionary heroism and self-sacrificing spirit, suppressed the arrogance of the invaders, reversed the situation in Korea, shattered the myth of "American invincibility," drove the so-called "United Nations Army" all the way back from the Yalu River to the 38th parallel, and turned the positions they defended into a Great Wall of steel. All the enemy's offensives were crushed, and its inhuman germ warfare could not save it from its doomed defeat. Finally, on July 27th last year, the American imperialism, which had repeatedly clamored "Let the machine guns and cannons do the talking" during more than two years of armistice negotiations, was forced to end this "war with no hope of victory" and had to sign the Korean Armistice Agreement.
    The Chinese people's great struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea has declared to the world: the Chinese people who have stood up are absolutely not to be bullied, and the Chinese people are determined to build their lives according to their own ideals; in order to ensure the realization of this ideal, the Chinese people must not ignore the situation in which imperialism arbitrarily invades its neighbors and threatens its motherland. The era of imperialism doing whatever it wants in Asia is over, and whoever does not recognize this fact will be beaten until their head is broken. The great victory of the Chinese and Korean people in resisting American aggression has declared to the world: Although American imperialism is extremely ferocious, it is outwardly strong but inwardly weak, and American imperialism's aggression not only needs to be defeated, but can also be defeated. As long as the people of the world take on the responsibility of defending peace, the schemes of the warmongers will surely fail.
    Facts have proved that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's participation in the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea is fully in line with the peace aspirations of the people of the world. Its joint combat with the Korean People's Army has safeguarded the independence of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, ensured the security of the motherland, which is undergoing peaceful construction, upheld human justice, and defended world peace. Therefore, not only the people of the motherland are grateful to it, the Korean people are grateful to it, but all people in the world who hope for peace and oppose war are grateful to it. The heroic achievements created by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea will shine for thousands of generations.
    In the four years since, in the just war of jointly resisting American imperialist aggression, the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Korean people has been further consolidated and developed, truly becoming an unbreakable friendship cemented with blood and life. The heroic behavior and noble qualities displayed by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Korean battlefield have also become a huge spiritual force for educating and inspiring the people of the whole country. "Learn from the Volunteer Army!" is no longer an empty slogan, but a conscious and widespread action among the masses. When people encounter difficulties in their struggles, they think of the Volunteer Army, and thus increase their courage to overcome difficulties; when people achieve victory in their struggles, they also think of the Volunteer Army, believing that the Volunteer Army also has a share in this achievement. The names of heroes such as Huang Jiguang and Qiu Shaoyun, the heroic positions of Shangganling and Yuyinshan, and many thrilling heroic deeds can be said to be known to every household. In the hearts of the people of the motherland, the Volunteer Army has become a symbol of not fearing hardship, not fearing difficulties, being brave and tenacious, a symbol of victory and heroism, and has become the embodiment of patriotism and internationalism.
    Today, the returning troops of the Volunteer Army have returned with the honor of great victory! The people of the whole country are also using the great achievements in building the motherland to welcome their own sons and brothers. The Volunteer Army has not failed the trust of the people of the motherland, and has excellently completed the sacred task of defeating the enemy and defending the motherland. The people of the motherland have also not failed the expectations of the Volunteer Army, and have also excellently carried out the great cause of supporting the Volunteer Army and building the motherland. Now, the First Session of the First National People's Congress is being held, the first Constitution of the Chinese people has been officially promulgated, and the National Day of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, which will review the achievements of the Chinese people's construction, is about to arrive. The comrades of the returning troops will see with their own eyes and feel personally that their arduous battles and bloodshed sacrifices in Korea have yielded great rewards: the motherland they have been thinking about day and night in Korea is gradually transitioning to a glorious socialist society. This is the achievement jointly created by the motherland's brave and invincible sons and the motherland's hardworking and courageous people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao! Let us be proud and cheer for the motherland for having such heroic sons and such people!
    As the returning People's Volunteer Army is about to take up their work posts, we believe that they will definitely maintain the fine style of hard struggle, maintain the noble qualities forged in the flames of war, not take credit, not be arrogant, study hard, work diligently, closely connect with the masses, be humble and prudent, and serve the socialist cause of the motherland diligently, create new achievements in their own posts, and carry forward greater glory.
    The seven divisions of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have returned triumphantly, but we must not forget that the state of armistice in Korea is still unstable, the Korean issue has not been peacefully resolved, the Syngman Rhee clique is still clamoring to provoke war, and American imperialism is still creating tensions and provoking war. Therefore, the people of the whole country and the comrades of the Volunteer Army returning home must not be paralyzed, must not be slack, must always maintain a high degree of vigilance, and must continue to struggle to defend the motherland, and for peace in Korea, Asia, and the world!

### 欢迎中国人民志愿军七个师的胜利归来

    欢迎中国人民志愿军七个师的胜利归来
    中国人民志愿军的七个师开始撤出朝鲜返回祖国了。我们谨向胜利归来的中国人民这支英雄的子弟兵表示最亲切的慰问和最热烈的欢迎。
    从中国人民志愿军出国作战以来，已经快到四年了。这是和平力量和战争势力激烈搏斗的四年。到今天，亚洲形势和整个世界形势都发生了巨大变化：朝鲜反侵略战争取得了胜利，印度支那的和平恢复了，国际紧张局势缓和了，中国的国际地位空前提高了，以苏联为首的世界和平民主力量大大发展了；而美帝国主义的战争政策和侵略冒险，却受到了严重的挫败，美国好战集团陷于从来未有的孤立地位。这是全世界爱好和平的人们协同斗争的伟大胜利。而中国人民的抗美援朝斗争，尤其是中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的并肩作战，对这一伟大胜利作了辉煌的贡献。
    四年以前，当世界上最强大最野蛮的帝国主义军队打到鸭绿江边的时候，当祖国的安全和世界的和平受到最严重的威胁的时候，中华民族最优秀的儿女挺身而起，组成了中国人民志愿军，告别了自己的祖国和亲人，离开了自己的和平生活和工作，奔向烟火弥漫的朝鲜，和朝鲜人民军一起，以无比的革命英雄气概和自我牺牲精神，压制了侵略者的气焰，扭转了朝鲜的战局，粉碎了“美国无敌”的神话，把所谓“联合国军”从鸭绿江一直赶回三八线，把自己守卫的阵地变成了钢铁的长城。敌人的一切攻势都被粉碎了，它那灭绝人性的细菌战，同样不能挽救它失败的命运。最后，到去年七月二十七日，这个在两年多的停战谈判中一再叫嚣“让机关枪和大炮去辩论吧”的美帝国主义，不得不被迫结束这场“毫无胜利希望的战争”，不得不在朝鲜停战协定上签了字。
    中国人民抗美援朝的伟大斗争向全世界宣告：站起来了的中国人民是绝对不可欺侮的，中国人民决心按照自己的理想建设自己的生活；为了保障这一理想的实现，中国人民绝不能对帝国主义肆意侵略自己的邻邦、威胁自己的祖国的情势置之不理。帝国主义在亚洲为所欲为的时代已成过去，谁要不承认这个事实，谁就要碰得头破血流。中朝人民反抗美国侵略的伟大胜利向全世界宣告：美帝国主义虽然穷凶极恶，但却外强中干，美帝国主义的侵略不但需要打败，也是能够打败的。只要全世界人民把保卫和平的责任担当起来，战争挑拨者的阴谋一定不能得逞。
    事实证明：中国人民志愿军参加抗美援朝战争是完全符合全世界人民的和平愿望的。它和朝鲜人民军的并肩作战，维护了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的独立，保障了正在和平建设的祖国的安全，伸张了人类的正义，捍卫了世界的和平，因此不仅祖国人民感激它，朝鲜人民感激它，全世界一切希望和平反对战争的人们都在感激它。中国人民志愿军在抗美援朝战争中创造的英雄业绩将千秋万代放射光芒。
    四年以来，在共同反抗美帝国主义侵略的正义战争中，中朝两国人民的传统友谊进一步巩固和发展了，真正成为用鲜血和生命凝结而成的牢不可破的友谊。中国人民志愿军在朝鲜战场上所表现的英雄行为和崇高品质，也成了教育和鼓舞全国人民的巨大精神力量。“学习志愿军！”已经不是一句空洞的口号，而是群众中自觉的广泛的行动。人们在斗争中碰到困难的时候，想起了志愿军，于是增加了克服困难的勇气，人们在斗争中取得胜利的时候，也想起了志愿军，认为这里也有志愿军的一分功劳。黄继光、邱少云等英雄的名字，上甘岭、鱼隐山等英雄的阵地以及很多惊心动魄的英雄事迹，可以说是家喻户晓了。志愿军在祖国人民的心目中已经变成不怕苦、不畏难、英勇、顽强的象征，胜利和英雄的象征，已经变成爱国主义和国际主义的化身了。
    今天，志愿军的归国部队带着伟大胜利的荣誉回来了！全国人民也用建设祖国的巨大成就来欢迎自己的子弟兵。志愿军没有辜负祖国人民的委托，出色地完成了打败敌人保卫祖国的神圣任务，祖国的人民同样没有辜负志愿军的期望，也出色地进行了支援志愿军和建设祖国的伟大事业。现在，第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议正在召开，中国人民的第一个宪法已经正式公布，检阅中国人民建设成就的中华人民共和国成立五周年的国庆节就要到来。归国部队的同志们将亲眼看到、亲身感到：自己在朝鲜的艰苦战斗和流血牺牲，已经取得了伟大的报偿：自己在朝鲜日日夜夜怀念着的祖国正在逐步过渡到光辉灿烂的社会主义社会。这是祖国英勇无敌的子弟和祖国勤劳勇敢的人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导之下共同创造的业绩！让我们为祖国有这样的英勇子弟和这样的人民而自豪而欢呼！
    在归国人民志愿军即将走上自己工作岗位的时候，我们相信他们一定能够保持艰苦奋斗的优良作风，保持在战火中锻炼出来的高贵品质，不居功，不骄傲，努力学习，埋头工作，密切联系群众，谦虚谨慎勤勤恳恳地为祖国的社会主义事业服务，在自己的岗位上创造新的成就，发扬更大光荣。
    中国人民志愿军的七个师凯旋回国了，可是，我们不要忘记，朝鲜停战状态还不稳定，朝鲜问题还未和平解决，李承晚集团还在叫嚣挑起战争，美帝国主义还在制造紧张局势、挑拨战争。因此，全国人民和志愿军归国部队的同志们，仍然不能麻痹，不能松懈，要经常保持高度警惕，要为保卫祖国，为朝鲜，亚洲以及世界的和平继续奋斗！
