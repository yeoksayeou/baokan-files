    Shanghai's Private Factories' Cotton Cloth Entirely Controlled by State-Owned Commerce
    All Private Cotton Cloth Retailers in the City Brought into the Orbit of State Planning
    By the end of August, all cotton cloth produced by private factories in Shanghai had been processed, uniformly purchased, exclusively marketed, or purchased by state-owned commerce. All private handicraft cotton weaving factories in the city signed processing, exclusive marketing, or purchasing contracts with the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation in August. Cloth produced by private dyeing and weaving, cotton textile, silk weaving, and wool weaving factories had already been entirely processed, exclusively marketed, or uniformly purchased by state-owned commerce before August. Now, the sub-standard cloth and remnants produced by these private factories are also being purchased by state-owned commercial departments at reasonable prices. As of now, cotton cloth produced by private factories, which accounts for more than half of the total cotton cloth production in Shanghai, is entirely rationally distributed by the state through state-owned commercial departments to supply people in various regions. These private factories and workshops have also successively embarked on the path of state capitalism, and production has been brought into the orbit of state planning. In addition, all individual laborers producing cotton cloth in the city have been organized into production cooperatives or production teams, and are conducting production in a planned manner under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Cooperatives.
    Before August of this year, approximately 98% of the cotton cloth produced by Shanghai's private cotton cloth industry was already being processed, exclusively marketed, or uniformly purchased by state-owned commerce. However, the remaining 2% of cotton cloth from private factories not controlled by state-owned commerce became the target of speculation by illegal private merchants. For example, corduroy produced by handicraft cotton weaving workshops once became a popular item for black market trading by cotton cloth brokers, with the black market price per piece exceeding the state-owned commercial department's list price by 100,000 yuan. Sub-standard cloth produced by many processing and exclusive marketing private factories was also frequently bought by private cotton cloth merchants and sold as good cloth. Consumers often found that the cloth would tear easily after one wash and could no longer be worn. Now that state-owned commerce controls all cloth produced by private factories, the above phenomena can be completely eliminated. (Xinhua News Agency)

    Private cotton cloth retailers in Shanghai began a city-wide transformation in early August. By August 20th, 449 private cotton cloth retail stores had signed batch purchase contracts with the Shanghai Municipal Corporation of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation; 787 cotton cloth vendors had established batch purchase relationships with the Shanghai Municipal Corporation of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation and obtained cloth purchase permits. Now, private cotton cloth retailers in Shanghai have been preliminarily brought into the orbit of state planning through the mode of state capitalism.
    Due to the expansion of state processing orders, the Shanghai market's cotton cloth supply was already basically controlled by state-owned companies in the fourth quarter of last year. In the first half of this year, the vast majority of private retailers had already switched to purchasing goods from state-owned companies. The transformation of private cotton cloth retailers was thus well-positioned. At the end of July and early August of this year, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government announced the implementation of city-wide batch purchases for private cotton cloth retailers at mobilization meetings for shop assistants, capitalists, and vendors in the cotton cloth industry, and explained the significance and necessity of this transformation. Afterwards, they were organized to conduct discussions. Shop assistants and capitalists in the cotton cloth industry expressed their support for the transformation measures taken by the People's Government and enthusiastically applied for batch purchases. Many shop assistants and capitalists also expressed their willingness to actively improve operations.
    Private retail stores that have signed batch purchase contracts with the state-owned Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation have now begun to purchase all their goods from state-owned companies. They have prepared inventory plans and submitted them to the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation for review. At the same time, all stores have begun to implement clearly marked prices and sell at the retail list prices of state-owned companies. According to the contract stipulations, private cotton cloth retail stores are prohibited from refusing to sell, raising prices, engaging in wholesale trade within or outside the city, and engaging in illegal activities such as processing and dyeing in the future. Vendors who have established batch purchase relationships with the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation must also sell at the retail prices approved by state-owned companies in the future, and are similarly prohibited from raising prices, hoarding, and reselling.
    To facilitate private retailers in picking up goods nearby during batch purchases, the Shanghai Municipal Corporation of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation has recently opened ten wholesale departments.

### 上海私营工厂所产棉布全归国营商业掌握  全市私营棉布零售商都已纳入国家计划轨道

    上海私营工厂所产棉布全归国营商业掌握
    全市私营棉布零售商都已纳入国家计划轨道
    上海市所有私营工厂生产的棉布，到八月底止，已经全部由国营商业加工、统购、包销或收购。全市所有的私营手工棉织工厂，都在八月份和中国花纱布公司上海采购供应站签订了加工、包销或收购合约。私营染织、棉纺织、丝织、毛织工厂所生产的布，早在八月份以前就全部为国营商业加工、包销或统购了，现在这些私营工厂生产的次布和零布，也全部由国营商业部门按合理价格收购。至此，产量占上海全市棉布总产量一半以上的私营工厂所生产的棉布，完全由国家通过国营商业部门进行合理分配，供应各地人民。这些私营工厂和工场也先后走上了国家资本主义的道路，生产纳入了国家计划的轨道。另外，全市所有生产棉布的个体劳动者，也已经组织成生产合作社或生产小组，在上海市合作社联合社领导下有计划地进行生产。
    在今年八月份以前，上海市私营棉布工业生产的棉布，就已经有百分之九十八左右为国营商业加工、包销或统购，但还有百分之二左右没有为国营商业掌握的私营厂的棉布，就成为不法私商投机取巧的对象。如手工棉织工场生产的灯芯绒，曾一度成为棉布掮客黑市交易的热门货，每匹的黑市价格曾超过国营商业部门牌价十万元。许多加工、包销的私营工厂生产的次布，也经常为棉布私商买去冒充好布出售，消费者买进后往往洗一次就东破西裂，不能再穿。现在国营商业掌握私营工厂所产的全部布匹，上述现象就可完全杜绝。（新华社）

    上海市私营棉布零售商在八月初开始实行全业性的改造，到八月二十日止，私营棉布零售店已有四百四十九户和中国花纱布公司上海市公司签订了批购合约；棉布摊贩有七百八十七户和中国花纱布公司上海市公司建立批购关系，领得了购布证。现在，上海市私营棉布零售商已初步通过国家资本主义的方式全部纳入国家计划轨道。
    由于国家加工订货扩大，去年第四季度内，上海市场棉布货源便已基本上为国营公司所掌握，今年上半年私营零售商极大部分都已转向国营公司进货。私营棉布零售商的改造由此已具备了条件。今年七月底八月初，上海市人民政府分别在棉布业的店员、资方和摊贩的动员会议上，宣布对私营棉布零售商实行全业性的批购，并说明这一改造的意义和必要。会后又组织他们进行讨论。棉布业店员和资方对人民政府采取的改造措施都表示拥护，踊跃申请批购。许多店员和资方并表示要积极改善经营。
    和国营花纱布公司订立批购合同的私营零售店，现已开始全部向国营公司进货，他们已编造要货计划，送花纱布公司审核。与此同时，各店并开始实行明码实价，按国营公司零售牌价出售。按照合约规定，今后私营棉布零售店不得拒售、抬价，不得对本埠或外埠进行批发，并不得有加工、印染等违法行为。已和花纱布公司建立批购关系的摊贩，今后也要按国营公司核定的零售价出售，同样不得抬价，抢购、套购。
    为了便于私营零售商在批购时能就近取货，中国花纱布公司上海市公司最近已开设十个批发部。
