Xinhua News Agency, 29th. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit group is ruthlessly levying taxes in Taiwan. According to Chiang bandit newspapers, the Chiang bandits' tax revenue in 1949 was 53 million yuan in puppet currency, but by 1953 it had increased to 1.98 billion yuan, an increase of more than 36 times. Since the beginning of this year, tax revenue has continued to increase. The number of tax defaulters is increasing. Large numbers of tax defaulters have been forced to sell their homes or have been arrested and imprisoned. Many private small and medium-sized enterprises have been forced to close down or have been seized and auctioned off. According to statistics from the Chiang bandit Taiwan Provincial Department of Finance, last year there were more than 220,000 "tax cases of violations and arrears that have not yet been cleared" in Taiwan.

However, in order to alleviate the increasingly serious financial crisis and expand its army, the Chiang bandit gang has recently been continuously raising the tax rates on many donations and taxes, and dispatching large numbers of armed military police to extort old tax arrears. According to Chiang bandit newspapers, the Chiang bandit tax collection office, finance section, and police station in Keelung City have recently formed a "temporary organization for urging the collection of old arrears" to launch a so-called "comprehensive collection campaign." All section chiefs and above of the Keelung Chiang bandit municipal government and its affiliated institutions have been ordered to assist in coercing tax payments. The Keelung City Chiang bandit court has also established a "temporary financial execution office" to specifically handle tax arrears cases. The Chiang bandit personnel and military police who are pursuing tax arrears are also taking the opportunity to extort and rob. According to Chiang bandit newspapers, when tax officials and military police in Chiayi County extorted tax arrears, they entered people's homes late at night and rummaged through boxes and cabinets, causing local residents to "complain incessantly." It has been discovered that two-thirds of the Chiang bandit tax officials in Kaohsiung City have embezzled tax funds.

    蒋匪帮在台湾横征暴敛
    【新华社二十九日讯】蒋介石卖国集团在台湾横征暴敛。据蒋匪报纸透露，蒋匪一九四九年的税收额为伪币五千三百多万元，而到一九五三年增加到十九亿八千多万元，共增加了三十六倍多。今年以来，税收额仍在不断增加。欠税户越来越多。大批欠税户被逼得倾家荡产或被逮捕入狱。许多私营中小企业被迫倒闭或被查封拍卖。据蒋匪台湾省财政厅统计，去年台湾“违章及滞纳尚未清理的税务案件”达二十二万多起。
    但是，蒋匪帮为了缓和日益严重的财政危机和扩充军队，最近不断提高许多捐税的税率，并调派大批武装军警勒索旧欠税款。据蒋匪报纸说，基隆市的蒋匪税捐稽征处、财政科和警察局已在最近组成“催征旧欠临时机构”，发动所谓“全面催征”。基隆蒋匪市政府及所属机构股长以上人员都奉命出动协助勒逼税款。基隆市蒋匪法院也成立了“临时财务执行处”，专门处理欠税案件。追索欠税的蒋匪人员和军警也乘机敲诈抢劫。据蒋匪报纸说，嘉义县的税务人员和军警在勒索欠税时，深更半夜进入民房，翻箱倒笼，当地居民“怨声载道”。高雄市的蒋匪税务人员已发现贪污税款的达三分之二。
