Xinhua News Agency, Rome, September 6th: TASS reported from Rome on September 5th: The General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, Palmiro Togliatti, wrote an editorial for "l'Unità" entitled: "Striving for a New Policy for Italy."

Togliatti wrote: "The failure of the 'European Defense Community' as a result of the vote in the French National Assembly has raised for the people of Europe a question that we have long considered urgent and significant. A new system of international relations must now be established, and this system must be built on truly new foundations... A solution must be found immediately, because the vote in Paris only has the nature of rejection, and only involves one country; at the same time, all enemies of peace and instigators of war are still actively trying to manipulate and continue their evil adventures in the service of imperialism."

Togliatti emphasized that although the rulers of Italy have obediently carried out the instructions of the U.S. State Department and the instructions of the loyal supporters of the "European Defense Community" since 1948, "they have never been able to conduct an open discussion on this notorious treaty in either house of parliament." Togliatti pointed out that this was entirely because the majority of public opinion recognized the very serious dangers contained in this treaty.

Togliatti then wrote: "Now, it is necessary to immediately and clearly express our attitude in accordance with Italy's interests and the will of the vast majority of the people who demand peace."

Togliatti pointed out that what is urgently needed now is to resolve the German question and unify Germany through democratic means. Equally urgent is the need to strive for a comprehensive adjustment of relations between European countries. Any policy that attempts to divide Europe with opposing military blocs runs counter to this. Italy advocates the unification of Germany and needs to form closer alliances with the people of European countries. Italy does not need a policy of establishing a "European Defense Community" that hinders the achievement of these goals.

    意共总书记陶里亚蒂发表文章指出
    意大利不需要建立“欧洲防务集团”的政策
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社罗马五日讯：意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂为“团结报”写了一篇社论，题目是：“为意大利争取一个新政策”。
    陶里亚蒂写道：“由于法国国民议会表决结果而造成的‘欧洲防务集团’的失败，向欧洲各国人民提出了我们很久以前就认为是迫切而重大的问题。现在必须建立一个新的国际关系体系，必须在真正新的基础上建立这一体系……必须立即找出一个解决办法，因为巴黎的表决只带有拒绝的性质，而且只涉及一个国家；同时，一切和平的敌人、战争挑拨者仍在积极活动，企图玩弄手腕，继续他们为帝国主义服务的罪恶冒险。”
    陶里亚蒂着重指出，虽然意大利的统治者从一九四八年起一直驯服地执行美国国务院的指令和“欧洲防务集团”的忠实拥护者的指令，但是，“他们从来没有能够在议会的任何一院就这一臭名远扬的条约进行过公开讨论”。陶里亚蒂指出，这完全是因为大多数的舆论认清了这一条约包藏着十分严重的危险。
    陶里亚蒂接着写道：“现在必须根据意大利的利益和绝大多数人民要求和平的意志，立即明确地表示态度”。
    陶里亚蒂指出，现在迫切需要的是解决德国问题，通过民主的途径来统一德国。同样迫切需要的是努力争取全面调整欧洲各国之间的关系。任何企图以对立的军事集团分裂欧洲的政策都是与此背道而驰的。意大利主张德国的统一，需要与欧洲各国人民结成更加紧密的联盟。意大利不需要阻碍达到这些目的的建立“欧洲防务集团”的政策。
