Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 29th. "Pravda" published an observer's article entitled: "What is the Purpose of the London Nine-Power Conference?"

The article states: The London conference of foreign ministers from the United States, Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Canada opened on the 28th. The conference will discuss new plans to arm West Germany and include it in the Atlantic Group's military system, plans that are being put forward to replace the bankrupt plan to establish a "European Defense Community."

The author writes that Western diplomats have been running around for almost a month trying to finalize this conference.

As for the specific plans that the foreign ministers of various countries brought to London, based on information revealed in the newspapers, one can draw a definite conclusion: they all agree to arm West German revanchists, but they have not yet reached a consensus on how to do this. The very convening of this conference is an act of undermining the cause of peace, not to mention the decisions that American diplomats may force the conference to make. Bonn and London know that French public opinion will not agree to the revival of the "(German) Wehrmacht." Anticipating that the French delegation may adopt an "uncompromising attitude" based on these considerations, blackmail and intimidation are already being used against France.

It is seen that Dulles held bilateral talks with Mendès-France after arriving in London. The press openly stated that the purpose of the American diplomat was to find a way to make the French Prime Minister unconditionally accept the American-Bonn plan. How the situation will develop in London will soon be clear.

The article continues, but it cannot be ignored that the people of Western European countries are increasingly and fiercely opposed to the revival of German militarism. In France, Britain, and West Germany, the struggle against the re-establishment of the "(German) Wehrmacht" in any form is constantly intensifying. Although the European public is increasingly and resolutely demanding that the problem of ensuring European security be resolved under the principle of collective efforts of all countries with different social systems, the organizers of the London conference are still clinging to the outdated and bankrupt principle of America's "policy of strength."

The observer concludes that no matter what resolutions the London conference makes, one thing is beyond doubt: they cannot stop the great contemporary movement of people of all countries striving for peace and security.

    伦敦九国会议的目的是什么？
    ——“真理报”发表的观察家的文章的摘要
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十八日讯：“真理报”发表观察家的一篇文章，题目是：“伦敦九国会议的目的是什么？”
    文章说：美国、英国、法国、西德、意大利、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡、加拿大等九国外长的伦敦会议在二十八日开幕。会议将讨论武装西德和把西德包括到大西洋集团军事体系里去的新计划，这个计划是提出来代替已经破了产的、建立“欧洲防务集团”的计划的。
    作者写道，西方国家的外交家为了谈妥举行这次会议，差不多已奔走了整整一个月了。
    至于说到各国外交部长们带到伦敦来的具体计划，那么根据报上透露的消息，可以得出一个肯定的结论：他们大家都同意武装西德复仇主义者，至于如何来进行这件事，他们仍然没有取得一致的意见。召开这个会议这件事的本身就是一个破坏和平事业的行动，更不用说美国外交官可能强迫会议作出的那些决定了。波恩和伦敦都知道，法国舆论不会同意“（德国）国防军”的复活。估计到法国代表团根据这些考虑可能采取“不让步的态度”，已在对法国进行讹诈和恫吓。
    大家看到，杜勒斯到伦敦后就和孟戴斯—弗朗斯进行双边谈判，报界公开说，美国外交官的目的是，无论如何要设法使法国总理无条件地接受美国—波恩计划。事态在伦敦如何发展，最近可见分晓。
    文章接着说，但是，不能不看到，西欧各国人民日益激烈地反对德国军国主义复活。在法国、英国和西德，反对以任何形式重建“（德国）国防军”的斗争不断加强。虽然，欧洲公众日益坚决地要求在各种社会制度的一切国家的集体努力的原则下解决保障欧洲安全的问题，但是伦敦会议的组织者仍然紧抱住美国的“实力政策”这种陈腐的、早就破产了的原则。
    观察家最后说，不论伦敦会议作出什么样的决议，有一点是不用怀疑的：他们阻拦不住各国人民争取和平与安全这样一个当代极其伟大的运动。
