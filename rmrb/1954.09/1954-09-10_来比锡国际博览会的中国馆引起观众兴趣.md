Xinhua News Agency, Leipzig, 8th: On the first day of the Leipzig International Fair, the Chinese Pavilion, with its exhibits reflecting the leaps and bounds in China's industrialization since the start of the Five-Year Plan, rich resources, agricultural products, and handicrafts, aroused great interest among visitors.

　　On the morning of the 5th, German Democratic Republic Premier Otto Grotewohl, Deputy Premiers Otto Nuschke, Heinrich Rau, Minister of Foreign and Domestic Trade, Georg Ulrich Handke, other ministers of the German Democratic Republic government, and diplomatic envoys to Germany visited the Chinese Pavilion in batches. Ji Pengfei, the Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to Germany, Zhang Guangdou, the Commercial Counselor, and Gu Yifan, the head of the Chinese delegation participating in the Leipzig International Fair, introduced the new products exhibited in the Chinese Pavilion this year to the guests. After the visit, Premier Grotewohl wrote in the visitors' book: "Your exhibition this year shows us your great achievements in heavy industry and machine manufacturing. This is the key to maximizing the satisfaction of necessities, this is the key to socialism. In brotherly unity, we wish the Chinese people even greater achievements." Deputy Premier Nuschke wrote: "The speed at which the People's Republic of China is striding forward amazes all of us more and more. The extremely outstanding Chinese Pavilion at the 1954 Leipzig Fair shows the clever combination of time-honored, highly developed handicrafts with modern heavy machine manufacturing."

　　After the pavilions at the fair opened to the public, a continuous stream of visitors poured into the Chinese Pavilion. In this year's Chinese Pavilion, they saw the preliminary results of the Chinese people's socialist industrialization. The Chinese Pavilion, covering an area of 5,000 square meters, is characterized this year by its nationally-flavored decorations and an increase in new products in the area of machinery and equipment. Above the main entrance of the Chinese Pavilion is a green glazed tile roof, with a row of palace lanterns hanging on the corridors on both sides, and pictures of Chinese landscapes and scenery hanging on the walls; after entering the gate, you can see the huge statue of Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, standing in the center of the main hall. On the screen behind the statue is written Chairman Mao's instructions on the general line and general task of the transition period.

　　The central hall precisely divides the entire Chinese Pavilion into two parts: on the right are displayed various machines, electrical products, mineral resources, and metal refining products. Here are various new types of metal cutting machine tools, mining machinery, substation equipment, car engines, and motorcycles. They mark the rapid development of China's machine manufacturing industry in recent years. Large steel, heavy steel rails, and seamless steel pipes newly produced by Anshan Iron and Steel in 1953 are also displayed here. Also on display are non-ferrous metals such as antimony, tungsten, and tin, which are rarely produced in Europe. On the left are various agricultural products, food industry raw materials, light industrial daily necessities, handicrafts, valuable carpets, and world-renowned Chinese silk. The exhibition of daily necessities, textiles, medical equipment, cultural and educational supplies, etc., marks that China is developing light industry correspondingly on the basis of developing heavy industry, to meet the people's growing material and cultural needs.

　　Among the exhibits in the Chinese Pavilion this year, there is also something that the German people are particularly interested in, and that is a tower crane standing at the entrance of the exhibition hall. This crane is a new machine made by China according to the crane exhibited by the German Democratic Republic in China last spring. It is a powerful tool on construction sites for capital construction.

　　In the book exhibition hall in the sample exhibition area in the center of Leipzig, a large number of finely printed Chinese books and publications are on display. During the fair, Chinese silk textiles, daily necessities, and handicrafts also began to be sold in Leipzig department stores. In addition, four Chinese chefs are cooking famous Chinese dishes such as Peking duck and Chinese refreshments in the public canteen here to serve people from all countries who come here especially for them.

　　The first day of the Chinese Pavilion's exhibition has left a deep impression on visitors: the Chinese people are confidently marching forward on the road of socialist industrialization.

    来比锡国际博览会的中国馆引起观众兴趣
    【新华社来比锡八日电】在来比锡国际博览会开放的第一天，中华人民共和国馆就以它在展览品中所体现的，中国人民自五年计划开始以来的工业化的飞跃发展、丰富的资源、农产品和手工艺品引起了参观者的巨大兴趣。
    五日上午，德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥、副总理奥托·努舍克、亨利希·劳，对外与国内贸易部长格里哥尔和德意志民主共和国政府其他各部部长以及各国驻德外交使节等，分批到中国馆来参观。中华人民共和国驻德大使姬鹏飞、商务参赞张光斗和参加来比锡国际博览会的中国代表团团长顾一凡向来宾介绍了今年在中国馆展出各项新的产品。格罗提渥总理参观后在来宾意见簿上写道：“你们今年的展览向我们显示了你们在重工业和在机器制造业上的伟大成就。这是最大限度地满足必需品的钥匙，这是社会主义的钥匙。在兄弟般的团结中，我们祝中国人民进一步获得更大的成就。”努舍克副总理写道：“中华人民共和国迈步前进的速度使我们大家愈来愈惊异了。一九五四年来比锡博览会中极为出色的中国馆显示：历史悠久的、高度发展的手工艺与现代化的重机器制造的巧妙的配合。”
    在博览会的各馆向群众开放后，川流不息的观众拥到中国馆内。他们在今年的中国馆中看到了中国人民进行社会主义工业化建设的初步成果。占地五千平方公尺的中国馆，今年的特点是富有民族色彩的装璜和展览品中增多了机器装备方面的新产品。中国馆的正门上面是绿色琉璃瓦的屋檐，两边的长廊挂着一排宫灯，壁上挂着中国山水风光的图片；进入大门后，就可以看到耸立在正厅中央的中国人民领袖毛泽东主席的巨大塑像，在塑像后面的屏风上，写着毛主席关于过渡时期总路线总任务的指示。
    中间的正厅恰好把整个中国馆划成了两个部分：右边陈列了各种机器、电机产品、矿产资源和金属炼制品等。这里有各式新型金属切削机床、矿山机械、变电站设备，汽车引擎和摩托车。它们标志着中国近年来机器制造业的迅速发展。一九五三年鞍钢新出的大型钢材、重型钢轨、无缝钢管也陈列在这里。在这里还陈列着在欧洲出产极少的锑、钨、锡等有色金属。左边是各种农产品、食品工业原料、轻工业日用品、手工艺品、贵重的地毯和名闻全球的中国丝绸。日用百货、纺织品、医疗器械、文教用品等的展出标志着中国在发展重工业的基础上相应地发展了轻工业，以适应人民日益增长的物质和文化的需要。
    今年中国馆的展览品中还有一件使德国人民特别感到兴趣的东西，这就是矗立在展览馆门口的一架塔式起重机。这架起重机是中国按照民主德国去年春天在中国展览的那架起重机而造成的新机器，它是基本建设中建筑工地上的有力工具。
    在来比锡市中心样品展览区，书籍展览馆中有大批精印的中国书籍和出版物展出。博览会期间，中国丝绸纺织品、日用品和手工艺品等也开始在来比锡的百货公司中出售。此外，还有四名中国厨师在这里的公共食堂里烹制着北京烤鸭等著名的中国菜和中国茶点，以供应慕名而来的各国人士。
    中国馆第一天的展出已给参观者留下了一个深刻的印象：中国人民正满怀信心地在社会主义工业化建设的道路上迈步前进。
