    Beijing People's Printing Factory Employees
    Enthusiastically Discuss the Draft Constitution Chapter by Chapter and Article by Article
    Beijing People's Printing Factory, one of the largest state-owned enterprises in Beijing, had all its employees discuss the draft constitution chapter by chapter and article by article, and put forward suggestions for revisions to the draft constitution. After the promulgation of the draft constitution, the Draft Constitution Discussion Office of the factory held many large and small report meetings, and used various tools and methods such as blackboards, slides, loudspeakers, and posters to publicize it to all employees, and organized employees to study and discuss it. During the study and discussion, the employees mostly connected it with their past and present lives, and initially understood the significance of the state formulating the constitution and the basic content of the draft constitution. They supported every article of the draft constitution and expressed that they would take practical actions to ensure the implementation of the constitution after it is formally formulated. Then, they began to discuss the draft constitution chapter by chapter and article by article, and put forward suggestions for revisions and supplements to the draft constitution. In order to gain experience, the factory organized three pilot groups (each group with ten to twelve people) to conduct typical experiments. The personnel of these three pilot groups spent three days discussing it chapter by chapter and sentence by sentence. During the discussion, the vast majority of people spoke enthusiastically and put forward their opinions on revising the draft constitution. The three groups put forward a total of eighty-two revisions. From August 1st to 11th, all employees of the factory began to discuss it chapter by chapter and article by article. Ninety-six percent of the employees conducted the discussion in a serious and responsible spirit, and put forward a total of two thousand nine hundred and twenty-five revisions and supplements to the draft constitution (including the eighty-two revisions proposed by the pilot groups). Among these opinions, 702 belonged to the "Preamble" section, 1,195 belonged to the "General Principles" section, 250 belonged to the "State Organs" section, 636 belonged to the "Basic Rights and Duties of Citizens" section, 40 belonged to the "National Flag, National Emblem, Capital" section, and 102 belonged to other sections. These included textual revisions, content revisions, and even structural revisions. During the pilot group discussion, Zhang Tongxi suggested that the words "water flow" in Article 6 of the draft constitution were not easy to understand and could be changed to water sources and rivers or other nouns. Yu Changfeng suggested that the second item of the powers of the National People's Congress in Article 27, "to formulate laws," should be changed to "to formulate and revise laws," and the fourth item of the powers of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in Article 31, "to formulate decrees," should be changed to "to formulate and revise decrees," because if they have the power to formulate laws or decrees, they should have the power to revise them; in Article 41, the President of the People's Republic of China "ratifies treaties concluded with foreign countries" could be changed to "ratifies and abolishes treaties concluded with foreign countries"; in Article 74, the term of office of the presidents of the local people's courts at all levels is four years, and in Article 82, the term of office of the procurators-general at all levels is four years, both of which could be changed to a term of two years, which would be better because it would be the same as the term of office of the local people's congresses at all levels. Zhang Zhongkun suggested that after "the state encourages the initiative and creativity of citizens in labor" in Article 16, it would be best to add "and provides necessary assistance." Zheng Daoxiang suggested that in Article 18, "all state organ personnel must... obey the constitution and laws..." should be changed to "abide by" instead of "obey"; in Article 19, "punish all traitors and counter-revolutionaries," "punish" should be changed to "severely punish or strictly punish"; in Article 20, "defend the security of the state" could be changed to "defend the security of the motherland," because the scope of the motherland is broader; in Article 49, an item "management of banking, currency and credit system" should be added between the seventh and eighth items of the powers exercised by the State Council. Lu Siyu suggested that after "punish all traitors and counter-revolutionaries" in Article 19, "punish lawbreakers who disrupt social order" should be added; after "no citizen may be arrested without a decision by the court or approval by the procurator-general" in Article 89, "except for those caught in the act" should be added; in Article 93, "...has the right to obtain material assistance" could be changed to "has the right to enjoy material assistance." Luan Renxing suggested that in Article 93, "The state establishes social insurance, social relief and mass health undertakings, and gradually expands these facilities..." the words "according to the development of production" should be added above "gradually expands these measures"; in Article 99, "foreigners who have suffered persecution are granted the right of residence," "the state also provides material assistance when it deems it necessary" should be added. Wen Lianjie suggested that "public property is sacred and inviolable" in Article 101 could be changed to "public property is inviolable by anyone." Wang Xiushi suggested that a clause should be added to the General Principles: "The People's Republic of China shall, in accordance with international agreements and on the basis of the fundamental principles of equality and mutual benefit, conclude treaties of friendship and commerce with relevant countries and develop international trade." Bo Jiapei suggested that in Articles 8, 9, and 10, "protect... ownership and other property ownership," the "other property ownership" in could be removed, because it is already stipulated in Articles 11 and 12. Some people suggested that in Article 95, "the state encourages and assists citizens engaged in scientific, educational, literary, artistic and other cultural undertakings in their creative work," technological innovation should also be included. Some workers also suggested that the sentence "women have equal rights with men to vote and to stand for election" in Article 86 could be removed, because the same article already includes "regardless of nationality, race, sex...", and Article 96 also stipulates that "women enjoy equal rights with men in... all aspects." Another group of workers disagreed with removing this item, because according to China's specific circumstances, it is still necessary to emphasize that women enjoy equal rights with men.
    The Beijing People's Printing Factory has completed its discussion of the draft constitution. After studying and discussing the draft constitution, the employees have a high enthusiasm for production and have expressed that they will greet the birth of China's first constitution with new achievements in production.

    北京人民印刷厂职工
    逐章逐条热烈地讨论宪法草案
    北京最大的国营企业之一的北京人民印刷厂全厂职工逐章逐条讨论了宪法草案，对宪法草案提出了修改意见。该厂宪法草案讨论办公室在宪法草案公布后，曾举行多次大小型报告会，并且利用黑板报、幻灯、广播器、招贴画等各种工具和方式，向全厂职工进行了宣传，并组织职工学习和讨论。在学习和讨论中，职工们大都联系自己过去和现在的生活，初步懂得了国家制定宪法的意义和宪法草案的基本内容，他们拥护宪法草案的每一条，表示要以实际行动保障宪法在正式制定后的实施。接着即开始逐章逐条讨论宪法草案，对宪法草案提修改和补充意见。为了取得经验，该厂曾组织了三个试点小组（每个小组有十人至十二人），进行典型试验。这三个试点小组的人员用三天的时间逐章逐句进行讨论。在讨论中，绝大多数人都热烈发言，提出了自己对宪法草案的修改意见。三个小组共提出了八十二条修改意见。全厂职工在八月一日至十一日开始逐章逐条讨论，百分之九十六的职工都以认真负责的精神，进行了讨论，共提出了对宪法草案的修改和补充意见二千九百二十五条（包括试点小组所提的八十二条）。这些意见属于“序言”部分的有七百零二条，属于“总纲”部分的有一千一百九十五条，属于“国家机构”部分的有二百五十条，属于“公民的基本权利和义务”部分的有六百三十六条，属于“国旗、国徽、首都”部分的有四十条，其他一百零二条。其中包括文字上的修改、内容上的修改，以至结构上的修改。在试点小组讨论中，张通喜提出：宪法草案第六条中“水流”两字不好懂，可改为水源与河流或其他名辞。俞长风提出：第二十七条全国人民代表大会职权的第二项“制定法律”应改为“制定和修改法律”，第三十一条全国人民代表大会常务委员会职权第四项“制定法令”应改为“制定和修改法令”，因为既然有权制定法律或法令，就应有权修改；第四十一条中，中华人民共和国主席“批准同外国缔结的条约”，可改为“批准和废除对外国缔结的条约”；第七十四条地方各级人民法院院长任期四年和第八十二条各级检察长任期四年，都可改为任期两年，这样和地方各级人民代表大会每届任期相同就更好一些。张仲崑提出：第十六条中“国家鼓励公民在劳动中的积极性和创造性”下面，最好加上“并给予必要的帮助。”郑道翔提出：第十八条中“一切国家机关工作人员必须……服从宪法和法律……”，“服从”应改为“遵守”；第十九条中“惩办一切卖国贼和反革命分子”，“惩办”应改为“严惩或严厉惩办”；第二十条中“保卫国家的安全”，可改为“保卫祖国的安全”，因为祖国包括的范围更广一些；第四十九条国务院行使的职权中第七、第八两项中间应加一项“对银行、货币及信贷制度的管理”。卢思玉提出：第十九条“惩办一切卖国贼和反革命分子”的下面，应增加“惩办扰乱社会秩序的不法分子”；第八十九条中“任何公民，非经法院决定或者检察长批准，不受逮捕”下面，应加“现行犯除外”；第九十三条中“……有获得物质帮助的权利”，可改为“有享受物质帮助的权利”。栾仁星提出：第九十三条中“国家举办社会保险、社会救济和群众卫生事业，并且逐步扩大这些设施……”在“逐步扩大这些措施”上面应加上“根据生产的发展”几个字；第九十九条中对“受到迫害的外国人，给以居留的权利”，下面增加“国家认为有必要时并且给予物质帮助”。闻联杰提出：第一百零一条“公共财产神圣不可侵犯”，可改为“公共财产任何人不可侵犯”。王秀实提出：在总纲中应加一条：“中华人民共和国依照国际协定，根据平等互惠的基本原则，与有关国家订立友好通商条约，发展国际贸易。”博家培提出：第八条、第九条、第十条中，
  “保护……所有权和其他财产所有权”中的“其他财产所有权”都可去掉，因为在第十一条、十二条中已有规定。有一些人提出：第九十五条“国家对于从事科学、教育、文学、艺术和其他文化事业的公民的创造性工作，给以鼓励和帮助”中，应把技术革新也列入。还有一些工人提出：第八十六条中“妇女有同男子平等的选举权和被选举权”一句可以去掉，因为在同条中已有了“不分民族、种族、性别……”，在九十六条中也规定了“妇女在……各方面享有同男子平等的权利。”另一部分工人不同意去掉这一项，因为根据我国的具体情况，强调妇女享有与男子平等的权利还是必要的。
    北京人民印刷厂全厂讨论宪法草案已经结束，职工学习和讨论宪法草案后，生产热情高涨，纷纷表示以生产上的新成就迎接我国第一个宪法的诞生。
