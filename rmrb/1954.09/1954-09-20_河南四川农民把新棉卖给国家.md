    河南四川农民把新棉卖给国家
    【新华社开封十八日电】从九月一日起，河南省的洛阳、安阳、商邱、新乡四个专区的主要产棉县的种棉农民，就先后开始把新摘的棉花卖给国家。许多农业生产合作社和互助组在棉花采摘后，就按照预购合同把晒干、拣净的棉花交给供销合作社。洛阳、信阳等四个专区的许多种棉农民在出售新棉的同时还把大量陈皮棉卖给国家。从九月一日到十五日全省收购的棉花已达到四百万斤。
    河南省人民政府财政经济委员会和各供销合作社等，为了保证完成和超额完成今年国家的新棉收购任务，并使种棉农民在出售新棉后能买到必要的生产资料和生活资料，进行了有关收购的各种准备工作。现在全省增设了一千一百多个棉花收购站和收购点；组织了各种棉花加工车三万二千四百多部；训练了棉花分级人员一千四百六十多人。
    【新华社成都十九日电】四川省三百八十多万亩棉花普遍收花，估计可比去年增产。仁寿县棉花可增产百分之八左右。三台县十六万七千亩棉田，可增产皮棉四十多万斤。目前许多农民正按照预售合同把新棉卖给国家。自八月上旬到九月十日止，国家在四川省已收购新棉十一万一千三百三十三担。
