    China Writers Association Creation Committee Holds Workers' Forum
    Listening to Workers' Opinions on Literary Creation
    In order to strengthen the connection between writers and worker readers, to listen more to workers' opinions on literary creation, thereby improving literary creation and better meeting the needs of worker readers for literary works, the China Writers Association Creation Committee held a workers' forum on August 29. The attendees included literature-loving workers and cadres from Beijing People's Printing Factory, Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, Renli Factory, Yongming Printing Factory, Xinhua Printing Factory, Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, Changxindian Railway Factory, etc.; also present were comrades from the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Propaganda Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions; writers Sha Ting, Zhou Libo, Cao Yu, Zang Kejia, Ai Wu, Yan Wenjing, Kang Tuo, Yang Shuo, Ma Feng, etc. also participated in the forum. More than twenty people attended.
    At the meeting, the workers reflected that workers in various factories generally enjoy reading literary works, especially in recent years, due to the gradual improvement of workers' cultural level, everyone's interest in literary works has become stronger, and their appreciation ability has also greatly improved. Some good and relatively good new works, such as "Defend Yan'an," "Three Thousand Miles of Rivers and Mountains," and "Railway Guerrilla," have been warmly welcomed by the workers. The heroic figures in many excellent works live in people's hearts and become a force to inspire people to move forward. However, workers generally feel that the current literary creation in our country still has shortcomings, such as the lack of vigorous works, inability to meet the needs of the masses, the subject matter of works is not broad enough, the shaping of heroic images in general works is not strong and full enough, and writers are not deep and bold enough in exposing and expressing contradictions in life. At the meeting, everyone also put forward criticisms of some specific works. Finally, writers Zhou Libo, Cao Yu, Ma Feng, Sha Ting, Yang Shuo, Zang Kejia, Ai Wu, etc. spoke successively, believing that the workers' many opinions on literary creation were sharp and correct, and would be beneficial to the improvement of literary creation in the future.

    中国作家协会创作委员会召开工人座谈会
    听取工人对文学创作的意见
    为了加强作家和工人读者的联系，更多地听取工人对文学创作的意见，从而提高文学创作，更好地满足工人读者对文学作品的需要，中国作家协会创作委员会于八月二十九日召开工人座谈会。到会的有北京人民印刷厂、北京农业机械厂、仁立工厂、永明印刷厂、新华印刷厂、北京第一机床厂、长辛店铁路工厂等厂的爱好文艺的工人和干部；到会的还有中共北京市委宣传部、青年团北京市委宣传部、中华全国总工会宣传部、北京市总工会等单位的同志；作家沙汀、周立波、曹禺、臧克家、艾芜、严文井、康濯、杨朔、马烽等也参加了座谈。共到会二十多人。
    到会工人在会上反映：各厂工人普遍喜爱阅读文艺作品，尤其近年来由于工人文化水平的逐渐提高，大家对文艺作品的兴趣也更浓了，欣赏能力也大大提高。有些好的和较好的新作品如“保卫延安”“三千里江山”“铁道游击队”等，在工人中受到了热烈欢迎。不少优秀作品中的英雄人物，活在人们心里，成为鼓动人们前进的力量。但工人们普遍感到目前我国的文艺创作还存在着作品不够旺盛、不能满足群众的需要，作品的题材不够宽阔，一般作品中对英雄形象的塑造还不够有力和丰满，作家在揭露和表现生活中的矛盾时还不够深刻和大胆等缺点。会上，大家并对一些具体作品提出了批评。最后，作家周立波、曹禺、马烽、沙汀、杨朔、臧克家、艾芜等相继发言，认为工人对文艺创作的许多意见是尖锐的、正确的，对今后文艺创作的提高是有益的。
