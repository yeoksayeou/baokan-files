    Further Development of Friendly Relations Between China and Albania
    Cheng Wen
    After Nesti Nase, the first Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the People's Republic of Albania to China, arrived in Beijing, our capital, on September 10, he presented his credentials to Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government of our country on the 13th. The first group of diplomatic personnel from our country to the People's Republic of Albania also arrived in Tirana, the capital of Albania, in mid-August. This marks the further development of friendly relations between China and Albania, which is something that makes us deeply excited.
    Although Albania is thousands of miles away from us, the Chinese people have always held sympathy and friendship for the hardworking, brave, and glorious revolutionary Albanian people. The moving deeds of the Albanian people in resisting fascist aggressors and fighting for independence and freedom during World War II were admired and praised by the Chinese people, who were then resisting the aggression of Japanese imperialism. The liberation of Albania and the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution created conditions for developing friendly relations between the two peoples on a new basis. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Albania was one of the first countries to announce the establishment of diplomatic relations with our country. For nearly five years, under the common goal of defending peace and building socialism, the friendly relations between the Chinese and Albanian people have continued to develop. During this period, representatives of the Chinese people visited the people's Albania several times, conveying the friendship and respect of the Chinese people to the fraternal Albanian people, and also bringing back the Albanian people's love for the Chinese people. In addition, many exhibitions and other activities introducing each other's situations have been held in our two countries, which have been warmly welcomed by the people.
    The Chinese people have always watched with great concern and excitement the great achievements made by the Albanian people in developing their economy and culture and in the struggle to build socialism. As Chairman Mao Zedong said in his reply when Ambassador Nesti Nase presented his credentials: "In the ten years since the liberation of the Albanian people, under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party, they have shattered all the destructive conspiracies of enemies at home and abroad, and have been building their beautiful lives with confidence, and have achieved brilliant achievements. The patriotic spirit and unparalleled labor enthusiasm shown by the Albanian people in the struggle for socialist construction and defending the independence and security of their motherland are admired by the Chinese people."
    With the selfless help of the great Soviet Union and the support of other fraternal countries, the Albanian people quickly healed the wounds of war and began to implement their first Five-Year Plan in 1951. In the first three years of this five-year plan, Albania's industrial construction has already achieved great achievements. In 1953, Albania's total industrial output had increased eight times compared to pre-war levels, with electricity increasing twenty-four times and cotton textiles increasing twenty times. The old Albania under the rule of foreign imperialism and landlords and bourgeoisie produced almost not even a needle. Now, many important industrial sectors, such as mining, textiles, sugar refining and electricity industries, have been established. In the past, Albania did not have even an inch of railway, but now several railways with a total length of more than 100 kilometers have been laid. In agriculture, the sown area has increased by more than 50% compared with the pre-war period; due to the development of agricultural cooperativization and mechanization, the output of major agricultural products has increased. The grain harvest in 1953 increased by 56% compared to 1952.
    With the rapid development of economic construction, there has also been an upsurge in cultural construction. In the past, the vast majority of Albania's residents were illiterate. Now illiteracy is almost eliminated. Since liberation, the number of students in seven-year schools has increased six times compared to the pre-war period, and the number of secondary school students has increased three times. Six institutions of higher learning, unprecedented in Albania, have been established. In terms of material life, the income of the working people has increased, and the consumption of daily necessities has also increased greatly.
    These achievements of the Albanian people were obtained through arduous and unyielding struggles against enemies at home and abroad. In recent years, US imperialism and its puppet states have constantly instigated provocations and insidious sabotage activities against Albania, vainly attempting to put the Albanian people back into the shackles of imperialist enslavement. However, the heroic Albanian people have won one victory after another, resolutely shattering the imperialist conspiracy and firmly defending the independence and territorial security of their motherland. In order to ease the tense situation in Europe, the People's Republic of Albania fully supports the Soviet Union's proposal to establish a European collective security system. The efforts made by the Albanian people to strive for European and world peace are praised by the people of the world.
    Today, as we warmly welcome the first exchange of ambassadors between China and Albania, as Chairman Mao said, we firmly believe that the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries will continue to develop, which will not only be conducive to the enhancement of the happiness of the two peoples, but also contribute to the strengthening of the world peace and democratic forces headed by the Soviet Union.

    中阿两国友好关系的进一步发展
    程文
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国首任驻我国特命全权大使奈斯蒂·纳赛在九月十日抵达我国首都北京后，已于十三日向我中央人民政府毛泽东主席呈递国书。我国驻阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的首批外交人员，也在八月中抵达阿尔巴尼亚首都地拉那。这标志着中阿两国友好关系的进一步发展，是一件使我们深感兴奋的事。
    阿尔巴尼亚虽然离我们有万里之遥，但是中国人民对于勤劳勇敢、富有光荣革命传统的阿尔巴尼亚人民，一向怀有同情与友谊。阿尔巴尼亚人民在第二次世界大战中反抗法西斯侵略者、争取独立自由的可歌可泣的事迹，得到了当时正在抵抗日本帝国主义侵略的中国人民的钦佩和赞扬。阿尔巴尼亚的解放与中国人民革命的胜利，为在新的基础上发展中阿两国人民的友好关系创造了条件。中华人民共和国成立后，阿尔巴尼亚是最先宣布与我国建立外交关系的国家之一。将近五年来，在保卫和平和建设社会主义的共同目标下，中阿两国人民的友好关系不断发展。这中间，中国人民的代表数度访问了人民的阿尔巴尼亚，向兄弟般的阿尔巴尼亚人民传达了中国人民的友谊和敬意，也带回来了阿尔巴尼亚人民对中国人民的热爱。此外，在我们两国内，还进行了多次相互介绍情况的展览和其他活动，受到了人民的热烈欢迎。
    中国人民一直以极大的关怀和兴奋心情注视着阿尔巴尼亚人民在发展自己的经济、文化和建设社会主义的斗争中所取得的巨大成就。正如毛泽东主席在奈斯蒂·纳赛大使呈递国书时的答词中所说的：“阿尔巴尼亚人民解放后十年来，在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，粉碎了国内外敌人的一切破坏阴谋，满怀信心地建设着自己的美好生活，并取得了光辉的成就。阿尔巴尼亚人民在社会主义建设和捍卫祖国的独立和安全的斗争中所表现的爱国主义精神和无比的劳动热情，使中国人民感到钦佩。”
    在伟大苏联的无私帮助下，在其他兄弟国家的支持下，阿尔巴尼亚人民迅速医治了战争的创伤，并从一九五一年起开始实行了第一个五年计划。在这个五年计划的头三年里，阿尔巴尼亚的工业建设已经获得了巨大的成就。一九五三年阿尔巴尼亚的工业总产量已增为战前的八倍，其中电力增为二十四倍，棉织品增为二十倍。在外国帝国主义和地主资产阶级统治下的旧阿尔巴尼亚，是几乎连一根针也不生产的，而今，有许多重要的工业部门，如采矿，纺织、炼糖与电力工业，都已经建立起来了。从前阿尔巴尼亚连一寸铁路也没有，现在则已铺设了总长一百多公里的几条铁路了。在农业方面，播种面积已比战前增加了百分之五十以上；由于农业合作化、机械化的发展，主要农产品的产量都有了增加。一九五三年谷物收获量就比一九五二年增加了百分之五十六。
    随着经济建设的迅速发展，也出现了文化建设的高涨。在从前，阿尔巴尼亚的绝大部分居民是文盲。现在文盲已近绝迹。解放以来，七年制学校学生人数比战前增加了六倍，中学学生人数增加了三倍。在阿尔巴尼亚已建立了前所未有的六所高等学校。在物质生活方面，劳动人民的收入提高了，日用品的消费量也大大增加了。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民的这些成就，是在与国内外敌人进行艰苦卓绝的斗争中获得的。这些年来，美帝国主义及其仆从国家曾不断策动对阿尔巴尼亚进行挑衅和阴险的破坏活动，妄想把阿尔巴尼亚人民重新套进帝国主义奴役的枷锁中去。但是，英勇的阿尔巴尼亚人民却取得了一个接着一个的胜利，坚决地粉碎了帝国主义的阴谋，牢固地保卫着祖国的独立与领土的安全。为了缓和欧洲的紧张局势，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国全力支持苏联提出的关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议。阿尔巴尼亚人民在为争取欧洲与世界和平中所作的努力，是受到全世界人民的称颂的。
    今天，当我们热烈欢迎中阿两国第一次互派大使的时候，正像毛主席所说的，我们深信我们两国之间的友好合作关系必将继续发展，这不仅有利于两国人民的幸福的增进，并将有助于以苏联为首的世界和平民主力量的加强。
