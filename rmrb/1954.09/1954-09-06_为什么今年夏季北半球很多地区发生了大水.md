    Since the beginning of this summer, the Yangtze and Huai River basins in our country have experienced unprecedented flooding. However, thanks to the timely mobilization of millions of people by the Party and the government to fight the floods, and thanks to the great achievements made in water conservancy projects over the past five years, although this year's floods are larger than those of 1931, the extent of the disaster and the loss of life and property are much less than in 1931. This is a great victory for the Chinese people in their fight against natural disasters.

    Why did such large floods occur in the Yangtze and Huai River basins this year? Why have floods occurred in so many areas of the Northern Hemisphere this year? Will there be any more abnormal weather after this year's flooding? These are issues of concern to many people.

    According to currently available materials, this year's floods in Asia have not only occurred in the Yangtze and Huai River basins of China, but also in southwestern Japan, southern Korea, Pakistan, northeastern India, Afghanistan, and Iran. Moreover, the floods in these places are also unprecedented in many years. In Europe, several countries in the Danube River basin, such as Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary, have experienced major floods. In the Americas, the southern Gulf Coast of the United States and the southwestern United States have also experienced major floods. It can be seen that the abnormal weather changes this year are not localized.

    Comparing this year's situation with 1931, this year's abnormal situation is much more serious than in 1931. The floods of 1931 only occurred in China and Japan, while this year they have occurred widely in the Northern Hemisphere, with long periods of rainfall and large amounts of precipitation. The reasons for this situation can be summarized as follows:

    1. The position of the subtropical high-pressure system over the Pacific Ocean is more southerly and its intensity is weaker than in previous years, while the warm and humid airflows from the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea are very strong. This makes the warm and humid air over the Yangtze and Huai River basins very active.

    2. Due to a high-pressure system blocking the air over Siberia, the air flow is divided into two branches, one of which enters China via the Mongolian People's Republic. This southward-moving cold air meets the southwest warm airflow from the South China Sea or the Indian Ocean in the area from the Yangtze and Huai River basins to South Korea and Japan. Because these two airflows are equal in strength, the area where they meet (meteorologically called the frontal zone) changes very little. In June and July this year, the frontal zone in East Asia has remained in the Yangtze and Huai River basins and Japan. Low-pressure systems are most likely to form on the frontal zone (generally, there is precipitation in the low-pressure area). From May to July this year, a total of thirteen low-pressure systems formed in the Yangtze and Huai River basins, while there were only eight in 1931. This is the main reason for the heavy rainfall in the Yangtze and Huai River basins this year. In India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, and other places, the southward shift and prolonged stay of the cold and warm air meeting area have also caused prolonged torrential rains.

    3. A strong high-pressure system has also remained for a long time over the European part of the Soviet Union at high latitudes. The position of this high-pressure system was usually over the Scandinavian Peninsula. This year, it is about fifteen degrees east in longitude, so the cold airflow from near Iceland and the warm and humid airflow from the Azores meet over Central Europe, forming a persistent frontal zone. On this frontal zone, low-pressure systems occurred one after another, causing the summer floods in the Danube River region of Central Europe. In the Americas, the large amount of warm and humid tropical air from the Gulf of Mexico was very strong this summer in the southern United States. At the same time, cold air flowed southward from the Rocky Mountains. These two cold and warm airflows happened to meet in the southern Gulf Coast of the United States and the southwestern United States. Therefore, many low-pressure systems also formed in this area, resulting in prolonged torrential rains.

    We should recognize that the abnormal atmospheric circulation situation mentioned above is a whole, rather than a coincidence of several separate phenomena at the same time. At present, people explain the causes of this abnormal phenomenon by changes in solar thermal energy.

    From these analyses, we can know that the atmospheric circulation in the Northern Hemisphere this summer is abnormal. However, we cannot conclude from this that abnormal atmospheric circulation will cause major floods. Because sometimes abnormal atmospheric circulation can cause severe droughts. Changes in atmospheric circulation are not the direct cause of large-scale torrential rains, but only a background for torrential rains. We also need to consider other necessary conditions for the formation of precipitation.

    The most important direct cause of torrential rain is the upward movement of humid air. In the atmosphere, the temperature of air gradually decreases as it rises. When the temperature of the air drops to the point where the moisture in the air reaches saturation, water droplets will condense, resulting in rain. There are many reasons for the upward movement of air. The condition for torrential rain is large-scale continuous upward movement, which mostly occurs in the middle of low-pressure systems and is closely related to the activities of cold and warm air. The airflow around the low-pressure area flows toward the center of the low-pressure, creating an upward movement in the low-pressure area. At the same time, this airflow flowing to the center of the low-pressure area comes from all directions, bringing the cold air from the north and the warm and humid air from the south to meet in the low-pressure area. Warm and humid air is lighter than cold air, causing the warm air to climb over the cold air wedge, which intensifies the upward airflow. At the same time, the warm and humid air brought by the heat in summer is extremely humid, resulting in torrential rain. If cold and warm air frequently meet in a certain area due to the influence of atmospheric circulation changes, it will cause prolonged torrential rains in this area. This is the main reason for the concentration of torrential rains in Asia and Europe this year. In addition, the reasons for the heavy rainfall in some areas of the Americas this year are similar to those mentioned above, but there are also some other reasons. The warm and humid airflow from the Gulf of Mexico is lifted by the terrain in the Rocky Mountain area, and the instability of these warm and humid air masses themselves causes the air to rise and produce precipitation.

    Since the beginning of August, in Asia, this abnormal atmospheric circulation pattern has begun to dissipate. The subtropical high-pressure system has moved rapidly northward, the equatorial airflow has also moved northward, and the high-pressure system over Siberia has begun to disappear. Therefore, the area where cold and warm air meet has also moved northward to the north of the Yellow River basin. The Yangtze River basin has entered the real summer. This change has caused the Yangtze and Huai River basins to be controlled by a single tropical airflow, and low-pressure systems no longer form. Therefore, the torrential rains in the Huai River and Yangtze River basins have decreased rapidly since August 1, forming a long period of sunny weather. The recent continuous drop in the water level of the Yangtze River is also the reason for this. Although there is still rain in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in Sichuan and other places, its threat has been greatly reduced.

    Finally, we would like to make an estimate of the weather conditions that may occur in the future. According to the situations in 1931 and 1949, there were major floods in the Yangtze and Huai River basins in these two years, and the autumns in these two years were also colder earlier. This means that the time of the cold wave occurrence this autumn may be earlier like in 1931 and 1949. Although this is only based on experience and there is no sufficient theory to explain it, we must therefore be vigilant, prepare for frost prevention, and prevent the invasion of early frost to protect the growth of late autumn crops.

    为什么今年夏季北半球很多地区发生了大水
  　中央气象台
    今年入夏以来，我国长江、淮河流域发生了百年来未有的大水，但是由于党和政府及时的动员了千百万人民群众和洪水作斗争，以及由于五年来我国在水利工程建设上的伟大成就，尽管今年的大水比一九三一年还大，但是今年的受灾程度和人民生命财产的损失却比一九三一年少得多。这是我国人民和自然灾害斗争的伟大胜利。
    为什么今年在我国的长江和淮河流域发生了这样大的洪水？为什么今年北半球很多地区都发生了洪水？今年的大水出现以后会不会还有什么反常的天气出现？这是很多人所关心的问题。
    根据目前现有的材料看来，今年的大水，在亚洲不仅出现于中国的江淮流域，同时也出现在日本的西南部，朝鲜的南部，巴基斯坦，印度东北部，阿富汗和伊朗等地。而且，这些地方出现的洪水也都是多年来未出现过的。在欧洲，多瑙河流域的几个国家如德国、奥地利、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利等都发生了大水。在美洲，美国南部墨西哥湾沿岸，和美国西南部也发生了大水。可见今年天气变化的反常现象并不是局部性的。
    拿今年的情况和一九三一年相比较，今年的反常情况要比一九三一年严重多了。一九三一年的大水仅出现在我国和日本，今年则普遍的出现在北半球，而且降雨时间长，降水量又大。造成这种情况的原因归纳起来有下列几点：
    一、太平洋上副热带气流位置较往年偏南，而且强度较弱，而来自印度洋和我国南海的暖湿气流很强，这使得我国江淮流域上空暖湿空气很活跃。
    二、在西伯利亚上空由于有一个高气压的阻挡，空气的运行分成两支，其中有一支经蒙古人民共和国往南进入我国境内。这支南下的冷空气跟上面所讲的来自我国南海海面或印度洋的西南暖气流正好在我国江淮一带至南朝鲜及日本的这条线上相遭遇。由于这二支气流势力是均等的，所以它们相遭遇的地带（气象学上称做锋带）也就很少变动。今年六、七月，东亚地区中的锋带始终徘徊在江淮流域和日本一带。在锋带上面最容易有低气压生成出来（一般在低气压区域有降水出现）。今年自五月至七月在江淮流域一共有十三个低气压生成，而在一九三一年不过才有八个，这是今年江淮多雨的主要原因。在印度、巴基斯坦、阿富汗、伊朗等地也因为冷暖气流相会的地区南移，而且停留较久，也造成了长时间的暴雨。
    三、在欧洲高纬度地区的苏联欧洲部分上空，也有一个强大的高气压长时期的停留。这个高气压的位置往年是在斯堪的那维亚半岛上空。今年则偏东约十五个经度，因而自冰岛附近流入的冷气流和自亚速尔群岛流入的暖湿气流在中欧上空相遇，并形成了一条持久的锋带。在这条锋带上，接二连三的发生出低气压，因而造成中欧多瑙河区域的夏季大水。在美洲，今年夏季在美国南部来自墨西哥湾的大量暖湿热带气流很是旺盛，同时，自洛矶山一带有冷空气南下。这两支冷暖气流正好相遇在美国的南部墨西哥沿岸和美国西南部。因此，在这一带也有很多低气压生成，因而也出现了较长时间的暴雨。
    上面所说的大气环流情况的反常，我们应该认识到它是一个整体。而不是几个单独现象在同一时间的偶合。发生这种反常现象的原因，目前人们都是拿太阳热能的变化来解释。
    从这些分析中，我们可以知道今年夏季北半球的大气环流是反常的。但是我们还不能就此得出结论说大气环流的反常就会造成大水。因为有时候大气环流的反常会造成大旱。大气环流的变化还不是造成大范围暴雨的直接原因，而仅仅是造成暴雨的一个背景而已。我们还需要考虑到形成降水的其它必要条件。
    造成暴雨的直接原因最主要的是潮湿空气的上升运动。在大气中，空气上升时温度是逐渐降低的，空气的温度降低到空气中的水分达到饱和以后，就会有水滴凝结出来，这样就会造成雨。造成空气上升运动的原因很多。造成暴雨所要的条件是大规模的连续的上升运动，它多出现在低气压中间，而且和冷暖空气的活动有密切的关系。在低气压区域四周的气流向低气压中心流动，在低气压区内造成上升运动，同时这种流向低气压中心的气流是来自各方的，它们把北面的冷空气和南面的暖湿空气带来在低气压区域里相遇。暖而潮湿的空气较冷空气为轻，造成暖空气在冷空气楔上面的爬升作用，这样就加剧了上升气流。同时在夏季由热带来的暖湿气流是极为潮湿的，因而造成了暴雨。假如冷暖空气因为大气环流变化的影响而经常相遇于某一个地区，那就会在这一地区造成长时间的暴雨。今年在亚洲各地和欧洲各地形成暴雨集中的主要原因就是这样。此外今年美洲某些地区多雨的原因，和上面所述相似，而它还有一些其他的原因。来自墨西哥湾的暖湿气流在洛矶山地区受地形的抬升作用和这些暖湿空气本身的不稳定性造成了空气上升运动而产生了降水。
    自八月初开始，在亚洲地区，这种反常的大气环流形势，开始解消了。副热带气流迅速北移，赤道气流也随之北移，西伯利亚上空的高气压也开始消失，因而冷暖气流相会的区域也北移到黄河流域以北。长江流域进入了真正的夏季。这种变化使长江、淮河流域在单一的热带气流控制之下，低气压不再产生了，因而淮河和长江流域的暴雨，自八月一日以后即迅速减少，形成了较长时间的晴天。最近长江水位的连续下落也就是这个原因。虽然目前长江上游四川等地还继续有雨，但它的威胁已经减轻很多了。
    最后，我们想就今后可能出现的天气情况作一估计。根据一九三一年，一九四九年的情况，这两年在长江、淮河流域有大水，而这两年的秋季也冷得较早。这就是说，今年秋季寒潮发生的时间可能像一九三一年和一九四九年一样要早些。虽然这只是根据经验，还没有充分的理论来说明它，但是，我们不能不因此而提高警惕，做好防霜的准备，预防早霜的侵袭，以保护晚秋作物的成长。
