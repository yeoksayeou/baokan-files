Women of all thirteen nationalities in Xinjiang, particularly the vast number of working women, living in the new China, will never forget the life of beasts of burden they endured under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, oppressed by national discrimination, hatred, and feudal forces. At that time, women had absolutely no right to participate in work, study, or production, and they did not even have basic personal freedom.

With the liberation of Xinjiang, all these facts of blood and tears have become history. Under the radiant illumination of the Communist Party's ethnic policy and the policy of equality between men and women, and after five years of arduous struggle, women of all nationalities in Xinjiang have now gained equal rights with men in all aspects of politics, economy, culture, and life. They have actively and enthusiastically participated in various social activities, especially the general election movement. Women understand the relationship between elections and themselves, just like Black Liqi Khan, a poor peasant woman from Jiayi Township in Yutian County, said: "A successful election will greatly benefit us women. Our township election is now rooting the state power. With strong roots, the People's Government will be able to do a better job, production will be further increased, the country will become even richer and stronger, and our lives will be even more improved." In many areas, more than 90 percent of female voters participated in grassroots elections, and many outstanding women were elected as people's representatives at all levels of government and government workers. Among the 6,110 township people's representatives in the Urumqi Special District, female representatives account for 1,945. The Mongolian woman, Ximouzhen, was honorably elected as the Vice Chairman of the Bayingoleng Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture (special district level) People's Government. The number of women serving as street chiefs, township heads, and village heads is even greater. The number of female cadres participating in government work is also increasing year by year. The number of full-time women's work cadres at all levels above the district level increased from 634 in 1952 to 1,189 in 1953. This is an unprecedented miracle in the history of Xinjiang.

Because women of all nationalities have gained equal rights with men in politics and other aspects, and have the conditions and opportunities to participate in various jobs, the patriotic ideology and labor production enthusiasm of women of all nationalities have been particularly high. A large number of women have left their homes and entered factories and fields, actively participating in industrial and agricultural production. The number of female workers in Urumqi's factories has increased from more than 400 in 1950 to the current 3,054. Female workers, like male workers, participate in labor competitions and create a large amount of wealth for the country. Shatakhan, a Uygur female worker at the Xinjiang Provincial Export Company's fur factory, improved the fine skin processing method through painstaking research. Ordinary workers could scrape up to 160 skins and rub 100 husks per day, while Shatakhan could scrape 188 skins and rub 199 husks per day. The output was high and the quality was good, greatly promoting the production of the entire factory. She was named a labor model. Wang Fufen, an outstanding Hao Jianxiu worker and labor model at the "July 1st" Cotton Textile Mill, promoted the study of the Hao Jianxiu work method among the workers in the fine yarn workshop, improving the technology. The ability to watch fine yarn spindles in the entire workshop increased from an average of 310 spindles per person to an average of 710 spindles per person, saving the country 560 million yuan in one quarter. From 1953 to the present, a total of 75 work models and labor models have emerged in various factories and mines. In the vast rural areas, it is even more common for women of all nationalities to engage in field production. In addition to participating in weeding, picking cotton, and peeling corn, they also account for 20 to 30 percent of the female labor force participating in heavier work such as pulling soil, spreading manure, harvesting wheat, and threshing. According to statistics from the Urumqi Special District, a total of 20,173 female laborers were organized for production, accounting for 24 percent of the total number of laborers organized. Many of them have become banners on the agricultural production front and organizers and leaders of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. According to statistics from 17 agricultural production cooperatives, 10 women serve as deputy directors. In 1953, 20 female labor models attended the provincial agricultural labor model conference. This is playing a significant role in the socialist transformation of rural areas, and the social and family status of women has also been significantly improved. A new atmosphere of democracy, harmony, and united production is emerging in peasant families.

    新疆各族妇女站起来了
    赛力玛·塔力甫瓦
    生活在新中国的新疆十三个民族二百万妇女、特别是广大劳动妇女，绝不会忘记国民党反动统治时期，在民族歧视、仇恨和封建势力压迫下，所度过的牛马生活。那时候，妇女根本没有参加工作、学习和生产劳动的权利，甚至连起码的人身自由都没有。
    随着新疆的解放，这一切血和泪的事实已经成为历史。在共产党的民族政策和男女平等政策的光辉照耀下，经过五年来的努力斗争，现在新疆各族妇女在政治、经济、文化、生活各方面已经获得了和男子平等的权利。她们积极热情地参加了各项社会活动，尤其是普选运动。妇女懂得了选举和自己的关系，正像于阗县加衣乡贫农妇女黑里其汗说的：“闹好了选举对我们妇女有很多好处。现在我们乡选就是给国家政权扎根子。根子扎好了，人民政府的工作就会做得更好，生产也就会更提高，国家也就能更富强，我们的生活也就更加改善。”不少地区有百分之九十以上的女选民参加了基层选举，还有许多优秀的妇女被选为各级政权的人民代表和政府工作人员。在乌鲁木齐专区的六千一百一十名乡人民代表中，女代表占一千九百四十五名。蒙族妇女西谋珍，光荣地当选为巴音郭楞蒙古族自治区（专区级）人民政府副主席。妇女担任街长、乡长、村长的人数更多。参加机关工作的女干部也在逐年增加，区以上各级专职妇女工作干部，由一九五二年的六百三十四名增加到一九五三年的一千一百八十九名。这是新疆史无前例的奇迹。
    由于各族妇女在政治及其他方面获得了同男子平等的权利，有了参加各种工作的条件和机会，各族妇女的爱国思想和劳动生产积极性特别高涨，大批妇女从家庭走入工厂、走向田间，积极地参加了工业、农业生产。乌鲁木齐市各工厂女职工由一九五○年的四百多人，增加到现在的三千零五十四人。女工和男工同样参加了劳动竞赛，为国家创造了大量财富。新疆省出口公司皮毛厂维吾尔族女工沙塔汗，由于刻苦钻研技术，改进了细皮加工方法，一般工人每天最多刮一百六十张皮，搓麸一百张，而沙塔汗每天能刮一百八十八张皮，搓麸一百九十九张，产量高质量又好，大大推动了全厂生产。她被评选为劳动模范。“七一”棉纺织厂优秀的郝建秀工作者、劳动模范王傅芬，由于带动细纱车间工人学习郝建秀工作法，提高了技术，全车间看细纱锭能力由平均每人看三百一十个，提高到平均每人看七百一十个，一个季度就为国家节约了五亿六千万元。在各个厂矿中，从一九五三年到现在共涌现七十五名工作模范和劳动模范。在广大农村里，各族妇女从事田间生产的更为普遍，除参加拔草、摘棉花和剥包谷轻活外，参加拉土、撒粪、收麦、打场等较重劳动的也占女劳力百分之二十到三十。据乌鲁木齐专区统计，组织起来生产的女劳力共二万零一百七十三人，占到组织起来劳动力总数百分之二十四。她们中间许多人已经成为农业生产战线上的旗帜，成为互助合作运动的组织者和领导者。据十七个农业生产合作社的统计，妇女担任副社长的就有十名。一九五三年出席省农业劳动模范会议的女劳动模范有二十名。这对农村实行社会主义改造起着重大的作用，妇女的社会、家庭地位也因而有了显著提高，农民家庭中呈现出民主和睦、团结生产的新气象。
