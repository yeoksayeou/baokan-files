Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, September 4th: The following is the speech delivered by Pham Van Dong, Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, on the first day of September at a reception held by President Ho Chi Minh to celebrate the August Revolution of Vietnam and the ninth anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, as reported by the Vietnam News Agency.

Pham Van Dong said: The American aggressor bloc is seeking every possible means to establish the so-called Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, which is in reality a Southeast Asian aggressive bloc. The purpose of this bloc is to undermine the Geneva Accords on the restoration of peace in Indochina, create tension and instability in Southeast Asia, attempt to further interfere in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, as well as many other countries in Southeast Asia, and turn these countries into colonies and military bases of American imperialism. This conspiracy is part of the policy of American imperialists to vainly seek world hegemony and prepare for a third world war.

Pham Van Dong pointed out: The Geneva Conference was a major defeat for the American interventionists. The attempt by the United States to continue interfering in and expanding the Indochina war, and their conspiracy to drag many countries into the so-called joint action against the Indochina war have failed. Nevertheless, the United States is still unwilling to give up their conspiracy. Now that the armistice agreement has been signed and peace has begun to be restored in Indochina, the American imperialists are trying to undermine the implementation of the armistice agreement and the restoration of peace. They are also trying to drag many countries, including those that participated in the Geneva Conference, into the so-called Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

Pham Van Dong continued: For this reason, the Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly protest the conspiracy to establish the so-called Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the conspiracy of the American imperialists to undermine the restoration of peace in Indochina.

Pham Van Dong added: The French government has made an important contribution to reaching the armistice agreement at the Geneva Conference, and is now continuing to make the same important contribution in implementing the armistice and restoring peace in Indochina. We believe that the French government's participation in the conspiracy to establish this so-called Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is contrary to the terms it signed and agreed to at the Geneva Conference.

Pham Van Dong then said: The Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam welcome the position of the governments and people of many Southeast Asian countries, such as India, Burma, Indonesia, and Ceylon, in opposing the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

Speaking of the policy of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Pham Van Dong said: In order to ensure the implementation of the armistice agreement and the restoration of stable and lasting peace in Indochina, the Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam resolutely pursue a policy of peace and friendship with the people of other countries, and a policy of establishing good relations with other countries in the world. First of all, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will strive to strengthen the fraternal friendship with the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries, because this is a fundamental condition for defending and consolidating peace.

Pham Van Dong added: Based on the Five Principles mentioned in the Sino-Indian Joint Statement and the Sino-Burmese Joint Statement, the establishment of friendly neighborly relations between the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the government of the Kingdom of Laos, as well as the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia, will also greatly contribute to the restoration and consolidation of peace in Indochina. Similarly, on the basis of these five principles, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam hopes to establish friendly relations with all Southeast Asian countries to jointly defend and consolidate peace.

Pham Van Dong said: The Democratic Republic of Vietnam also guarantees to develop the relations that have been re-established between it and the French government as a result of the signing of the Geneva Armistice Agreement. We hope that this relationship will be one of trust and friendship. In order to achieve this goal, the French government should also make appropriate efforts, and in particular should avoid taking any actions that violate the terms signed and agreed upon at the Geneva Conference.

In concluding his speech, Pham Van Dong pointed out: Under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, and in the spirit of patriotism and self-sacrifice, and with the support of peace-loving people all over the world, the Vietnamese people are determined to achieve final victory and strive for the peace, unification, complete independence, and democracy of their motherland.

    在胡志明主席为庆祝越南八月革命和国庆的招待会上
    范文同副总理兼外长发表讲话
    【新华社讯】越南通讯社北越四日电：下面是越南民主共和国副总理兼外交部部长范文同一日在胡志明主席为庆祝越南八月革命和越南民主共和国成立九周年举行的招待会上的讲话。
    范文同说：美国侵略集团正在寻找一切可能的手段来建立一个实际上是东南亚侵略集团的所谓东南亚公约组织。这个集团的目的是要破坏日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平的协议以及制造东南亚的紧张和不稳定的局势，企图进一步干涉越南、老挝和柬埔寨以及东南亚其他许多国家，并把这些国家变成美帝国主义的殖民地和军事基地。这个阴谋是美帝国主义者妄想取得世界霸权和准备第三次世界大战的政策的一部分。
    范文同指出：日内瓦会议对美国干涉者来说是一个重大的失败。美国想继续干涉并扩大印度支那战争的企图和他们想把许多国家拖进对印度支那战争的所谓联合行动的阴谋都失败了。尽管如此，美国仍不甘心放弃他们的阴谋。现在停战协定既已签订，和平既已开始在印度支那恢复，美帝国主义者就竭力设法破坏停战协定的履行和破坏和平的恢复。他们还设法把许多国家，包括那些曾经参加日内瓦会议的国家在内，拉进所谓东南亚公约组织。
    范文同接着说：为了这个原因，越南人民和越南民主共和国政府强烈抗议建立所谓东南亚公约组织的阴谋，抗议美帝国主义者破坏印度支那和平恢复的阴谋。
    范文同又说：法国政府曾在日内瓦会议达成停战协定方面作了重要的一份贡献，现在在实现停战和恢复印度支那和平方面仍在继续作同样重要的一份贡献。我们认为：法国政府参与建立这个所谓东南亚公约组织的阴谋是违背它在日内瓦会议上签署和同意的条款的。　　范文同接着说：越南人民和越南民主共和国政府欢迎东南亚许多国家例如印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚和锡兰等国的政府和人民反对东南亚公约组织的立场。　　在谈到越南民主共和国政府的政策时，范文同说：为了保证停战协定的履行和印度支那稳定和持久和平的恢复，越南人民和越南民主共和国政府坚决执行同其他国家人民和平友好的政策，同世界其他国家建立良好关系的政策。首先，越南民主共和国将努力加强与苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家之间兄弟般的友谊，因为这是保卫和巩固和平的基本条件。　　范文同又说：根据中印联合声明和中缅联合声明中提到的五项原则，越南民主共和国政府和老挝王国政府以及柬埔寨王国政府之间建立友好的邻邦关系，这也将大大有助于印度支那和平的恢复和巩固。同样，在这五个原则的基础上，越南民主共和国政府希望和所有东南亚国家建立友好关系，来共同保卫和巩固和平。　　范文同说：越南民主共和国也保证发展和法国政府之间由于日内瓦停战协定的签订而重新建立起来的关系。我们希望这种关系将是信任和友好的关系。为了达到这个目标，法国政府也应当作适当的努力，特别是应该避免采取一切违反日内瓦会议上已经签字和取得协议的条文的行动。范文同在结束讲话时指出：在胡志明主席的领导下，本着爱国主义和自我牺牲的精神，以及在全世界爱好和平的人民的支持下，越南人民有决心取得最后胜利，争取祖国和平、统一、完全独立和民主。
