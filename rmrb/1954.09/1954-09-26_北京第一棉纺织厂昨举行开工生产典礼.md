    【本报讯】首都第一个棉纺织厂——国营北京第一棉纺织厂，在二十五日举行了开工生产典礼。
    清晨，全厂二千多名职工兴高采烈地走进了工厂。工人们一个个带上了整洁的工作围袋。五彩绸旗在迎风飘扬，扩音器里传出了清脆的歌声，巨幅标语显示了全厂职工为建设社会主义社会而努力的决心和意志。
    八时许，开工生产典礼开始。参加典礼的有全厂职工，中央纺织工业部部长蒋光鼐、副部长钱之光、陈维稷、张琴秋，中华全国总工会副主席邵井蛙，北京市人民政府副市长吴晗，中共北京市委工业部部长贾庭三，北京市总工会副主席刘莱夫。参加典礼的还有德意志民主共和国驻我国大使柯尼希、郊区农民代表等共二千多人。会上，杨慧洁厂长致开幕词后，柯尼希大使、蒋光鼐部长、吴晗副市长、贾庭三部长、刘莱夫副主席、郊区农民代表都先后在会上讲了话。他们一致为第一棉纺织厂的开工生产庆贺。最后，工人王鸿艳代表全体职工上台讲话。他说：“从今天起，我们将按照国家计划，不断把布匹供应给人民，并为社会主义建设事业积累资金。这多么值得我们欢欣鼓舞啊！德意志民主共和国的工人们造出纺纱机支援我们；农民弟兄用棉花支援我们，我们一定百倍努力，用劳动和智慧来搞好生产！”十时，工人们回到了车间，机器立刻转动起来。
    开工生产典礼结束后，由蒋光鼐部长剪彩。到会首长和来宾参观了厂房里的各个车间。
    国营北京第一棉纺织厂是一座新型的棉纺织工厂。它占地面积达十六万平方公尺，建筑面积八万多平方公尺，拥有五万纱锭一千多台布机。从去年七月动工兴建到今年五月机器开始转动，前后还不到一年。在建厂过程中，曾得到苏联和德意志民主共和国专家的帮助。
