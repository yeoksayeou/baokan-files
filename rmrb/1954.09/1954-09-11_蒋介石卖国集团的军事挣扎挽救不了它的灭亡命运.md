    The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, since being driven out of the mainland by the Chinese people, has been entrenched in Taiwan under the direct protection and support of U.S. imperialism, constantly reorganizing and expanding its remnant bandit troops, and continuing to engage in activities that harm the country and the people.
    From October 1949 to July of this year, according to incomplete statistics, the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has received more than one billion U.S. dollars in military "aid" from the United States. According to reports from the U.S.-Chiang news agency, U.S. military "aid" will increase to more than 500 million U.S. dollars annually, and the U.S. "aid" for 1954-1955 will increase to 650 million U.S. dollars. Recently, the United States handed over two destroyers to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and will soon hand over eighty jet planes, and will allocate more than 80 million U.S. dollars of "additional" military "aid" from strategic materials destined for Indochina to the Taiwan bandits.
    At the same time, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has always placed all its remaining bandit troops under the direct control of U.S. imperialism. The United States dispatched a "Military Assistance Advisory Group" to Taiwan in May 1951. In addition to supervising U.S. military "aid," training bandit troops, and selecting bandit military personnel to go to the United States and its military bases for training, this "advisory group" also stationed U.S. military "advisors" in bandit high-level military organs and various types of troops to directly control the Chiang bandit army. According to a Reuters dispatch on June 23, 1953, the U.S.-Chiang bandit gang agreed that "Nationalist army officers above the regiment level will have American officers as deputies," and the United States "guarantees to fully support those Nationalist troops with American officers as deputy commanders with American aid..." As the United States intensifies its aid to and expansion of the Chiang bandit army, the U.S. "Military Assistance Advisory Group" is also expanding. Its members have now expanded from dozens when it began its mission to more than 700, and according to Agence France-Presse, it will expand to 1,500, and "more (American) officers and sergeants will be assigned to small-scale units."
    The U.S. "Military Assistance Advisory Group" is actively training the remnants of the Chiang bandits in Taiwan. According to a United Press report, the United States trained more than 400 Chiang bandit army officers in the two and a half years ending March 1953. In 1953, about 1,300 U.S. military officers and Chiang bandit military officers trained by the United States were engaged in on-the-spot training activities for the Chiang bandit army, enabling the Chiang bandit army to master "artillery-dependent, cooperative, planned, American-style offensive tactics." The report also stated that "according to the Americans," the Taiwan Strait and the nearby three islands have been designated as the location for large-scale combat training of the Chiang bandit marine corps, where bandit troops are trained in so-called "amphibious offensive landing tactics." At the same time, the United States is intensifying its expansion of the Chiang bandit air force. According to reports, between March and May 1953, the United States handed over more than 70 jet trainer aircraft to the Chiang bandits for extensive training. In 1953, the United States trained a total of 3,500 Chiang bandit air force personnel and more than 800 senior pilots in Taiwan, Japan, Okinawa, and the United States. Not only that, but U.S. military authorities dispatched "chemical warfare expert" Chrisy to Taiwan in April last year to "study plans to strengthen chemical warfare training for the Nationalist army in Taiwan" with the Chiang bandit military authorities. The Chiang bandits also selected some soldiers from the navy, air force, artillery, and parachute troops to undergo bacteriological warfare training under the leadership of the U.S.-Chiang bacteriological research institution, the "U.S. Military Advisory Group Closed-Door Communications Office in Taiwan."
    In order to collect more cannon fodder, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique established four division-level administrative districts and twelve regiment-level administrative districts in Taiwan in 1952, forcibly conscripting soldiers. According to the Hong Kong "Sing Tao Daily," the Chiang bandit gang had forcibly conscripted about 30,000 new soldiers from when they fled to Taiwan until May 1952. In addition, the Chiang bandit gang also forced the conscription of university and college students in Taiwan, sending them to various military schools established by the Americans for reserve officer training. In July of this year, the Chiang bandits began their so-called fifth phase of "supplementary soldiers" and second phase of "reserve non-commissioned officers" training, with tens of thousands of Taiwanese farmers and middle school graduates being forcibly conscripted into camps for military training, and even fishermen and sailors in coastal areas were similarly subjected to military training by the U.S.-Chiang bandit gang. Recently, the Chiang bandit "Legislative Yuan" promulgated the so-called "Revised Military Service Law," stipulating the forced conscription of strong men aged 18 to 45 to serve as cannon fodder. The traitor Chiang Kai-shek also shamelessly asked his American masters to "establish an Asian anti-communist army," and he guaranteed to provide the United States with "twenty divisions" of cannon fodder.
    Recently, according to "Pan Asia News Agency," Chiang thief, under the planning of the United States, has drafted a "Three-Year Military Consolidation Plan," and the United States will massively expand Chiang thief's naval, land, and air forces.
    In recent years, Chiang Kai-shek, relying on U.S. equipment and "aid," has continuously carried out harassing and destructive wars against the Chinese mainland. According to United Press International, in 1952, the Chiang bandits harassed the mainland and islands a total of 305 times. These invading bandit troops were all annihilated or quickly repelled by the heroic coastal defense troops of the People's Liberation Army. After June 1953, the armed harassment of the coastal areas by the Taiwan bandit army became even more intense. The largest of these was in July 1953, when the Chiang bandits gathered more than 10,000 armed bandits, using Taiwan and Kinmen Island as bases, and under the cover of American-made planes and warships, harassed Dongshan Island in Fujian. They were severely attacked by the People's Liberation Army, which annihilated more than 3,000 of them, and the bandit troops quickly fled.
    In addition to the harassment activities of the Chiang bandit navy and army, American-made Chiang planes also bombed Shanghai on February 6, 1950, in the early days of Shanghai's liberation, causing more than 1,000 Shanghai residents to be killed or injured and more than 1,000 houses to be destroyed. Later, incidents of bandit planes flying from bases in Taiwan to harass coastal areas continued to occur. In the nearly five years since the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang fled to Taiwan, more than 100 American-made Chiang planes have been shot down or damaged by the coastal defense troops of the People's Liberation Army in the southeast coastal areas.
    The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique also colludes with U.S. imperialism to recruit social dregs in Taiwan for training, turning them into special agent bandits, and dispatching and air-dropping special agents to mainland China to carry out sabotage activities. In 1952, U.S.-Chiang special agents successively set up more than ten special agent strongholds on the islands along the coasts of Fujian and Zhejiang. U.S. imperialism has established a network of special agent bases around mainland China, starting from the Aleutian Islands, passing through South Korea, Japan, Okinawa, Taiwan, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Vietnam, and ending in Thailand.
    The military conspiracies of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in recent years are not only attempts to subvert the People's Republic of China and carry out a restoration in China; they also deliberately stir up trouble, deliberately provoke world wars, and undermine peace in Asia and the world.
    However, no matter how shamelessly Chiang thief struggles, he can never save the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique from its fate of collapse. Five years ago, the eight million Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops that were raised and equipped with six billion U.S. dollars were completely eliminated by the Chinese people, which is the most eloquent proof. In the past five years, the armed attacks of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army on the coastal areas have all suffered fatal blows. The People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces stationed in the southeast coastal areas have annihilated more than 352,000 Chiang bandits. In the future, the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army will certainly be able to eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek remnants, liberate Taiwan, and complete the sacred liberation cause of the Chinese people.
    Now, anyone who is willing to face reality can see that there is no force in the world that can stop the Chinese people from victoriously completing the sacred task of liberating their own territory of Taiwan. Even the American "Christian Science Monitor" had to admit in a report on August 20: The Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan is "an irresistible trend in Asian history, and if American foreign policy tries to obstruct it again, then this policy will be completely shattered."

    蒋介石卖国集团的军事挣扎挽救不了它的灭亡命运
    冯之丹
    蒋介石卖国集团自从被中国人民逐出大陆之后，一直在美帝国主义的直接庇护和支持之下盘踞台湾，不断地整编和扩充残余匪军，继续进行祸国活动。
    自一九四九年十月到今年七月，据不完全的统计，台湾蒋介石卖国集团从美国那里得到的军事“援助”款额已达十亿美元以上。据美蒋通讯社透露，美国的“军事援助”将要增加到每年五亿美元以上，一九五四年至一九五五年度的“美援”将增至六亿五千万美元。最近美国又把驱逐舰两艘和即将把八十架喷气机交给蒋介石卖国集团，并将从运往印度支那的战略物资中拨给台匪八千余万美元的
  “额外”的“军事援助”。
    同时，蒋介石卖国集团一直将它的全部残余匪军置于美帝国主义的直接控制之下。美国于一九五
  一年五月起派遣了一个“军事援助顾问团”驻在台湾。这个“顾问团”除了监督美国军事“援助”，训练匪军，选拔匪军事人员赴美国及其军事基地受训外，并在匪高级军事机关及各兵种部队中派驻美军“顾问”，对蒋匪军实行直接控制。据一九五三年六月二十三日的路透社电讯透露，美蒋匪帮协议“团级以上的国民党陆军军官，副的将由美国军官担任”，美国则“保证以美国的援助……充分支持那些由美国军官担任副指挥官的国民党军队”。随着美国加紧援助和扩充蒋匪军队，美国“军事援助顾问团”也日益扩充。它的成员现在已从它开始执行任务时的数十人扩大到了七百余人，而据法新社透露，它还要扩大到一千五百人，并“将会有更多（美国）的军官和军士分配到小规模的部队去”。
    美国“军事援助顾问团”积极整训台湾蒋匪的残兵败将。据合众社消息称，美国在截至一九五三年三月间的两年半中训练了蒋匪陆军军官四百余人。一九五三年内有美军军官及受美国训练的蒋匪军官约一千三百人从事对蒋匪陆军的就地训练活动，使蒋匪军掌握“依靠大炮的、合作的、有计划的、美国式的进攻战术”。消息并称“根据美国人的意见”，台湾海峡和附近的三个岛屿已被指定为蒋匪海军陆战队大规模作战训练的地点，在那里训练匪军的所谓“两栖进攻的登陆战术”。同时，美国并加紧扩充蒋匪空军力量。据消息透露，在一九五三年三月至五月间，美国共将喷气式教练机七十多架交给蒋匪，进行广泛的训练。一九五三年内，美国在台湾、日本、冲绳和美国国内各地共训练了蒋匪空军人员共三千五百人，另有高级飞行员八百多人。不仅如此，美国军事当局于去年四月间派遣
  “化学战专家”克利西到台湾活动，与蒋匪军事当局“研究加强对台湾国民党军队的化学战训练的计划”。蒋匪并从海军、空军、炮兵、降落伞部队中挑选部分士兵，在美蒋细菌研究机关“美国驻台军事顾问团关门通讯处”领导下，进行细菌战的训练。
    蒋介石卖国集团为了搜罗更多的炮灰，于一九五二年在台湾成立了四个师管区、十二个团管区，强行征兵。据香港“星岛日报”透露，蒋匪帮逃至台湾后至一九五二年五月就已强征新兵约三万人。此外，蒋匪帮还强迫征集台湾的大学专科学生，分送至美国人所设立的各种军事学校，施以预备军官的训练。今年七月，蒋匪已开始了所谓第五期“补充兵”和第二期“预备军士”训练，成万的台湾农民和中等学校毕业学生被强征入营受军事训练，甚至连沿海地区的渔民和海员也同样须受美蒋匪帮的军事训练。最近蒋匪“立法院”更颁布了所谓“修正兵役法”规定强征十八岁至四十五岁的壮丁充当炮灰。卖国贼蒋介石也曾无耻地要求美国主子“建立亚洲反共军队”，他并保证为美国提供“二十个师”的炮灰。
      最近据“泛亚社”透露，蒋贼在美国策划之下已拟就了一个“三年整军计划”，美国将大规模地扩充蒋贼的海陆空军力量。
      这几年来，蒋介石卖国贼就依仗着美国的装备和“援助”，不断地对中国大陆进行了骚扰性和破坏性的战争。据合众社供认，在一九五二年内蒋匪对我大陆及海岛共计骚扰了三百零五次，这些来扰的匪军均为我英勇的人民解放军海防部队所歼灭或迅速击退。一九五三年六月以后，台湾匪军对我沿海地区的武装骚扰，更有加无已。其中规模最大的一次是在一九五三年七月，蒋匪曾纠集一万余名武装匪徒，以台湾和金门岛为基地，在美造飞机和军舰的掩护下向我福建东山岛进行骚扰，当经我人民解放军痛击，歼灭其三千余人，匪军才迅速溃逃。
    除了蒋匪海陆军的骚扰活动之外，美制蒋机并曾于一九五○年二月六日上海解放初期大肆轰炸上海，使上海居民死伤一千余人，被毁房屋达一千余间。以后，匪机自台湾基地飞来骚扰我沿海地区的事件仍不断发生，蒋介石匪帮逃亡台湾后的近五年内，就有一百余架美造蒋机在东南沿海被我人民解放军海防部队所击落和击伤。
    蒋介石卖国集团还勾结美帝国主义在台湾搜罗社会渣滓加以训练，充当特务匪徒，并向我国大陆派遣和空降特务，进行破坏活动。一九五二年美蒋特务曾先后在闽浙沿海的各岛屿设置了十余个特务据点。美帝国主义已在中国大陆周围建立了一个从阿留申群岛起，经由南朝鲜、日本、冲绳岛、台湾、香港、菲律宾、越南，直到泰国的特务基地网。
    蒋介石卖国集团这几年来的军事阴谋活动，不仅企图颠覆中华人民共和国，在中国实行复辟；而且惟恐天下不乱，蓄意挑动世界战争，破坏亚洲和世界和平。
    但是，任凭蒋贼怎样无耻地进行挣扎，绝不能挽救蒋介石卖国集团的溃灭命运。五年前，以六十亿美元所豢养和装备起来的八百万蒋介石匪军都被中国人民彻底消灭，这就是最雄辩的证明。近五年来，蒋介石匪军对我沿海地区的武装进攻，都遭到了致命的打击，我驻东南沿海地区的人民解放军陆、海、空军已共歼灭蒋匪三十五万二千多人。今后中国人民和人民解放军也一定能够消灭蒋介石残匪，解放台湾，完成中国人民的神圣的解放事业。
    现在，只要肯正视现实的人都能看到，世界上没有任何势力能够阻挡中国人民胜利地完成解放自己国土台湾的神圣任务。甚至连美国“基督教科学箴言报”也不得不在八月二十日的报道中承认：中国人民解放台湾是“亚洲历史上的不可抗拒的潮流，如果美国外交政策再要对此加以阻挠，那末，这种政策是会被完全粉碎的。”
