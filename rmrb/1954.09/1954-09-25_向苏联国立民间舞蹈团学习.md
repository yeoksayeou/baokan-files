	Learning from the Soviet National Folk Dance Ensemble

	The visit and performances of the Soviet National Folk Dance Ensemble to China on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of our nation’s founding will make an important contribution to further promoting the profound friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union. Chinese dance workers will also have a good opportunity to learn from Soviet dance art, which is also of great significance for further developing China's young dance art.

	The rich and colorful folk dances of the various ethnic groups of the Soviet Union have achieved brilliant development after nearly twenty years of excavation, collation, and improvement by the Soviet National Folk Dance Ensemble. This is a great achievement made by Soviet dance artists under the support of the state and the nurturing of the people. The achievements of the Soviet National Folk Dance Ensemble are inseparable from the nearly twenty years of tireless work of the group's artistic director, Igor Moiseyev, and the creative labor of all the group's actors. The work of the Soviet National Folk Dance Ensemble is already recognized as one of the models for artistic workers in our country and people's democratic countries in inheriting and developing national artistic traditions.

	One of the secrets to the success of the Soviet National Folk Dance Ensemble is: to create art works for the people, it is necessary to study the relationship between art and the lives of the people. Artists should not only study the artwork itself, but also the lives of the people from which the art originates. Deeply learning from the lives of the people is one of the fundamental reasons why the Soviet National Folk Dance Ensemble can successfully sort out the representative dances of the various ethnic groups of the Soviet Union, and why it can centrally and typically express the lives and characteristics of the people on stage.

	Another principle of the Soviet National Folk Dance Ensemble in its creation is: to create art works that can be loved by the people, it is necessary to use ingenious management to correctly process and improve them according to the people's creation and its characteristics. Moiseyev opposes the attitude of curiosity seekers: artists are either poor imitators of folk dances, or they exaggerate certain characteristics of folk dances to sensationalize the public. He advocates that dancers should, based on the study of the lives of the people and the dances generated in the lives of the people, add necessary stage treatment to make its content more prominent, its form more refined, and give it a clear stage image; and they can rely on the artist's ingenuity to give folk dances new content and new forms.

	The diligent work of the Soviet National Folk Dance Ensemble has accumulated more than 160 repertory programs, an achievement that no other similar dance troupe can achieve. Their outstanding performances enjoy a high reputation in many European countries. Their works express the lives and characteristics of the Soviet people, and the hopes and struggles of the Soviet people. It inspires the Soviet and other peoples to fight for the victorious confidence in defending their peaceful labor lives.

	The reason why the Soviet National Folk Dance Ensemble led by Igor Moiseyev can achieve such achievements is by no means accidental. One of the reasons is that all the artists in the group have a high level of artistic accomplishment and have been continuously improving their technical level for twenty years. The Soviet National Folk Dance Ensemble stipulates that 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. every working day is reserved for creation or rehearsal, and this time is sacred and inviolable. It is precisely because of this long-term and unremitting hard work that the dance troupe continues to move forward.

	The working people of our country will feel happy to have the opportunity to appreciate Soviet folk dance art. Our dance workers and other art field workers should cherish this opportunity and learn from the Soviet National Folk Dance Ensemble.

	We wish the Soviet National Folk Dance Ensemble success in its work in China.

### 向苏联国立民间舞蹈团学习

    向苏联国立民间舞蹈团学习
    苏联国立民间舞蹈团在我国建国五周年之际来我国访问和演出，将对于进一步促进中苏两国人民间的深厚友谊，作出重要的贡献。而我国的舞蹈工作者将获得向苏联舞蹈艺术学习的良好机会，这对于进一步发展我国年青的舞蹈艺术，也有着重要的意义。
    丰富多采的苏联各族人民的民间舞蹈，经过苏联国立民间舞蹈团将近二十年的发掘、整理和提高，获得了辉煌的发展。这是苏联舞蹈艺术家们在国家的扶植和人民抚育下获得的巨大成就。而苏联国立民间舞蹈团的这些成就，则是和该团艺术领导人伊·莫伊塞耶夫将近二十年的不倦的工作和全团职演员创造性的劳动分不开的。苏联国立民间舞蹈团的工作，已经是我国和人民民主国家的艺术工作者在继承、发展民族艺术传统工作上的共认的模范之一。
    苏联国立民间舞蹈团的成功秘诀之一是：要创造人民的艺术作品，便要研究艺术和人民生活的关系。艺术家不只要研究艺术品本身，而且要研究艺术所由来的人民的生活。深入地向人民生活学习，是苏联国立民间舞蹈团所以能成功地整理出苏联各族人民的代表性舞蹈，所以能在舞台上集中地、典型地表现出人民的生活和性格的根本原因之一。
    苏联国立民间舞蹈团在创作上的另一个原则是：要创造能被人民喜爱的艺术作品，就要用匠心的经营来根据人民的创作和它的特点来正确地予以加工和提高。莫伊塞耶夫反对那种猎奇主义者的态度：艺术家或者只是民间舞蹈的拙劣的摹仿者，或者只是夸张民间舞蹈的某些特征来哗众取宠。他主张舞蹈家应该根据对人民生活，对人民生活中产生的舞蹈的研究，加上必要的舞台处理，使它的内容更凸出，使它的形式更洗炼，赋予以明晰的舞台形象；并且可以依靠艺术家的匠心而给予民间舞蹈以新的内容和新的形式。
    苏联国立民间舞蹈团辛勤的工作，积累了一百六十种以上的保留节目，这是任何其他同类的舞蹈团体所不能达到的成绩。他们的卓越演出在欧洲许多国家享有极高的盛誉。他们的作品表现了苏维埃人民的生活和性格、苏维埃人民的希望和斗争。鼓舞着苏联和各国人民为保卫自己的和平劳动的生活而斗争的胜利信心。
    伊·莫伊塞耶夫领导的苏联国立民间舞蹈团之所以能获得如此的成就也绝不是偶然的，其原因之一是全团的艺术家都具有高度的艺术修养，并且二十年如一日地不断提高自己的技术水平。苏联国立民间舞蹈团把每个工作日的上午九时到下午三时规定为创作或排练的时间，这个时间是神圣不可侵犯的。正是由于这种长期不倦的勤修苦练，才使舞蹈团不断地前进。
    我国的劳动人民将因能有机会欣赏到苏联民间舞蹈艺术而感到幸福。我国的舞蹈工作者以及其他艺术领域的工作者应该珍视这个机会，好好地向苏联国立民间舞蹈团学习。
    敬祝苏联国立民间舞蹈团在我国的工作获得成功。
