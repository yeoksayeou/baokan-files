The Birth of the Third Son
By Our Correspondent Li Wen and New Hunan Daily Correspondent Jian Chu

One day in mid-July, Wang Jinlian, who lived in Fanjiachapu, Shitan Township, Xiangyin County, Hunan Province, was, as usual, busy preparing tea. But today was different from usual. Today, the disaster-stricken farmers from the Binhu District of the county were to be transferred to the eastern mountainous area for production via this main road in front of her door – the main road from Xiangyin County to Shitan Township, Gaoshan Township, and other townships. Early in the morning, more than two hundred men and women from the township, carrying forty carrying poles and three sedan chairs, went to greet the Wangjia Township farmers who were about to be transferred to the township. The sedan chairs were prepared for the elderly among the disaster victims who could not walk. This reminded Wang Jinlian of many things in the past. She thought: this year's flood is so big, how many people would have starved and died during the puppet government? Now that we have the People's Government, it is completely different.

Around noon, disaster victims arrived in twos and threes. This small teahouse became a temporary "tea supply station," and Wang Jinlian was busy serving tea to the passing disaster victims. She looked up and saw three people standing in front of her: the man was Yang Peixian, a farmer from Qinghe Township in the disaster area, about forty years old, who looked like he had suffered from farming for many years. He looked quite shrewd. The woman was Yang Peixian's wife, Deng Yulian, with a very anxious face, carrying a big belly, either about to give birth or seven or eight months pregnant. She was breathing rapidly, with a cluster of sweat beads on the tip of her nose. A young woman with short hair was supporting her, their niece Li Qiulin. Wang Jinlian quickly moved a bamboo sleeping chair from the house, asked Deng Yulian to sit down, and gave her two cups of "salt and ginger tea" to calm her down, and then let her into the house. Wang Jinlian asked her kindly, "Sister-in-law, are you about to start labor!" Deng Yulian's face flushed red, and she said embarrassedly, "It's okay." However, she could not suppress the pain in her stomach, and her hands gripped the edge of the bed tightly. Jinlian comforted her: "Now, we are all liberated, all the farmers in the world are one family, old feudal habits [Note 1] should also be changed, don't worry, if you really start labor, 'produce' in my house." Deng Yulian looked at Wang Jinlian with grateful and doubtful eyes. Jinlian seemed to have guessed her thoughts, and said straightforwardly: "Sister-in-law, don't worry, my boss is very open-minded, I was a child bride, and came to his house very early, he is only three years older than me, he doesn't skimp on farming, and he is good to people, he is a good person..." Mentioning her husband, Jinlian unconsciously revealed her inner satisfaction and pride. This made Deng Yulian feel more at ease. Jinlian turned her head and saw Li Qiulin standing aside, and hurriedly said to her: "Your aunt is about to start labor. The township government is not far from here, hurry to the township government and let them call the district health center, and let the midwife come quickly!" Li Qiulin stepped out of the house and went straight to the township government, asking for directions along the way.

In the township government, Li Qiulin met Ni Yuxian, the director of the township women's association. When Ni Yuxian heard that a disaster-stricken woman was about to give birth, she quickly asked: "Where is she, in whose house!" Before Li Qiulin finished speaking, Ni Yuxian grabbed the telephone, "Hello, operator, connect me to the district government quickly!" The phone was quickly connected, and a comrade in the district promised her that she would immediately find the maternal and child health worker Guo Lanzhen and ask her to go to Fanjiachapu quickly. Ni Yuxian was uneasy and grabbed Li Qiulin, saying: "Let's take the shortcut to the district government to find the maternal and child health worker Guo Lanzhen." The two crossed a hillside and ran to the district. Before they arrived, Ni Yuxian's voice arrived first, "Maternal and child health worker Guo Lanzhen, has anyone seen her?" "Shitan Township called and said that a disaster victim is about to give birth to a Mao Mao (child). After receiving the call, Guo Lanzhen carried her small bag and ran out!" a district cadre told her. "Let's take the shortcut to intercept her!" Ni Yuxian said, and walked ahead. Near the fork in the road to the township government, Guo Lanzhen was also walking hurriedly. "Old Guo, we are looking for you, let's go quickly!" Ni Yuxian said happily.

Fanjiachapu actually only has two rooms, the outer room is the kitchen, and the inner room is the living room, where Wang Jinlian's family of four sleeps. When Ni Yuxian and the midwife Guo Lanzhen arrived at the teahouse, Wang Jinlian was explaining to Deng Yulian: to let Deng Yulian give birth to Mao Mao on her bed, she and her two children would set up another bed to sleep, and her husband was familiar with the place and could live in a neighbor's house, in short, there was no need to worry about anything. However, Deng Yulian insisted on refusing, fearing that giving birth to Mao Mao would dirty the Wang family's bed. Ni Yuxian considered: since Deng Yulian insisted on not dirtying the Wang family's bed, setting up another bed would also be convenient. So, everyone was busy setting up a bed next to the big bed, and Guo Lanzhen was busy sorting out the midwifery tools. Deng Yulian was also prepared, with the toilet paper and cloth pieces for childbirth... and even the baby's clothes. She said that she owed this to a good government. During the puppet government, when there was a flood, things would be washed away, and people wouldn't even be able to save their own lives. This year, the water kept rising, and the government sent ships to take us out of the dangerous embankment sections, and these odds and ends were also brought out.

Deng Yulian was sweating profusely, and her discomfort was worrying. Ni Yuxian suddenly remembered that they had come from the city in the morning, and there were many inconveniences on the road, and they were probably still hungry. Eating something might help. She said: "I was just busy and forgot to ask if you had eaten. I'll make you some food." The maternal and child health worker Guo Lanzhen also said that eating something would help with "production." Ni Yuxian quickly returned to the township government, which was very concerned about this matter and decided to allocate two catties of rice from the emergency relief grain to Deng Yulian. Ni Yuxian had one thousand yuan in her pocket and wanted to buy some eggs for the pregnant woman. Secretary Hu of the township government knew about it and said: "I also have one thousand yuan, take it too, and buy more eggs." Women's association member Zhou Daxiu said: "Leave the matter of buying eggs to me, Director of Women, you should still take care of the woman giving birth to Mao Mao!" Zhou Daxiu ran to several "Wuchang" [Note 2], but because the summer was hot and the chickens weren't laying eggs, she couldn't buy any. If it wasn't here, she ran there, she ran all over the hilly road, her head covered in sweat, and finally bought two eggs. Zhou Daxiu then brought the cooked eggs and hot wheat flour pancakes to Deng Yulian.

At around four o'clock in the afternoon, the baby's loud crying came from the inner room, and Yang Peixian's tightly furrowed brow immediately relaxed, and a "stone" in his heart landed. Wang Jinlian walked out of the inner room and told Lao Yang: "A very good Mao Mao, his crying is very loud!" Ni Yuxian and Guo Lanzhen also came out. Yang Peixian faced Ni Yuxian, Wang Jinlian, and Guo Lanzhen, and didn't know how to thank them. "This Mao Mao is really Chairman Mao's person!" he said excitedly, "I had two Yazi (sons) before, but neither of them could be saved. One was a miscarriage, and the other died a few months after birth. We are both almost forty years old, and this time we have encountered a flood that hasn't happened in a hundred years. What would have happened during the puppet government? I don't even dare to think about it. Not to mention Mao Mao, I'm afraid the adults wouldn't be able to be saved either. Now, Chairman Mao leads well, the People's Government cares about the people, the cadres are good, and the masses are also good. Director Ni and Sister-in-law Wang have been busy for us all day, and the district has sent a midwife. My Yazi is lucky, he is really Chairman Mao's person!"

A fat Mao Mao was safely born, and Zhou Daxiu was thinking: after the adult gives birth to Mao Mao, her body is weak, and she should eat some good food. Another women's association member, Tian Xizhen, heard that a disaster-stricken woman had given birth to Mao Mao on the road, and personally sent an egg that she had saved for many days, which made Zhou Daxiu very happy. She took out the lard that she had bought when her young son was sick a few days ago and made a fragrant egg-fried white rice for Deng Yulian.

Neighbors who were also disaster victims heard that a fat Mao Mao was born in Yang Peixian's house and came to congratulate him. Hearing the congratulatory people praise Mao Mao, Lao Yang was so happy that he couldn't close his mouth, and while he was busy letting everyone eat happy cigarettes (which he had specially bought from a cooperative far away), he said in his mouth: "This Yazi is Chairman Mao's person!"

It was already midnight. The cadres of the township government had just finished their work for the day - receiving and receiving disaster-stricken farmers. Ni Yuxian walked out of the township government, still feeling like something was unfinished, and remembered, "It would be good for the mother who gave birth to Mao Mao to eat a few more meals." So, she cooked a large bowl of thin rice porridge and walked towards Fanjiachapu. At this time, people had already rested. She called the door open and handed the porridge to Yang Peixian, who was sleeping in the outer room, so that Deng Yulian could eat a meal of porridge when she woke up.

Ni Yuxian walked out of Fanjiachapu. She felt relaxed, and gusts of fresh wind blew from the fields, carrying the scent of rice. She was immersed in an unspeakable joy. ... When she approached a lush cluster of trees in front of her house, she realized: "How did I get home so quickly on a one and a half li road?"

Note 1: There used to be a local legend that whoever's house a child was born in, that house would have bad luck.
Note 2: Here, villages are very scattered, a few families live together, called a "Wuchang," called a certain Wuchang or a big house.

    第三个儿子的诞生
    本报记者　力文  新湖南报记者　见初
    七月中旬的一天，湖南省湘阴县石塘乡范家茶铺的王金莲，照例忙着准备茶水。但今天和往日不同，今天，本县滨湖区受灾的农民兄弟要从门前这条大道——湘阴县城到石塘乡、高山乡等乡的大道，转移到东乡山区进行生产。大清早，本乡里的二百多个男男女女，还带着四十副扁担，三乘小轿，去迎接将要转移到本乡来的王家乡农民去了。小轿是给灾民中走不动的老年人准备的。这使王金莲想起很多过去的事情，她想：今年的水这样大，在伪政府时候，不知要饿死、拖死多少人啊，现在有了人民政府，便大不相同了。
    快到中午时分，三三两两的灾民来到了。这个小小茶铺，变成了临时的“茶水供应站”，王金莲正忙着招待过路的灾民们吃茶。她猛抬头，看见面前站着三个人：男的是水灾区清河乡的农民杨培先，四十岁光景，一看就知道是多年种田受过苦的。人长得挺精明。女的是杨培先的妻子邓郁莲，一副十分着急的面孔，挺着大肚子，不是快要临盆，也怀孕七八个月了。她急促地喘气，鼻尖上冒着一簇汗珠。一个剪发的青年妇女搀扶着她，是他们的外甥女李秋林。王金莲连忙从屋里搬出来一把竹睡椅，让邓郁莲坐下，让她先喝两杯“盐姜茶”，稳一稳心，又把她让到屋里。王金莲亲切地问她：“大嫂子，您是不是要发作啦！”邓郁莲面孔飞红，不好意思地说：“不要紧。”可是，她不能抑制肚子的疼痛，两只手紧抓着床沿。金莲宽慰她：“现在，我们都翻身啦，天下农民是一家，老封建习惯〔注一〕也要改变啦，莫着急，真发作了，就在我屋里‘生产’。”邓郁莲怀着感激的和疑虑的眼光望着王金莲。金莲像猜透了她的心思似的，心直口快地说：“大嫂子尽管放心，我的老板，他很开通哩，我是个童养媳，很早就来到他屋里，他只比我大三岁，他种田不惜力，对人也好，是个好人……”提起自己的丈夫，金莲不自觉地流露出内心的满意和自得。这使得邓郁莲宽心些了。金莲回头看到站立一旁的李秋林，急忙对她说：“你舅妈快发作了。乡政府离这里不远，你赶快到乡政府，让他们打电话给区卫生所，让接生员快来！”李秋林一步迈出屋门，一路打听着，直奔乡政府去了。
    在乡政府里，李秋林遇到了乡妇女会主任倪玉先。倪玉先听说有个灾民妇女快要生产，连忙问：“在那里，在谁屋里！”李秋林的话音未落，倪玉先便抓起电话机子，“喂，总机，给我快要区政府！”电话很快便打通了，区里一个同志答应她，马上去找妇幼保健员郭兰珍，让她快到范家茶铺。倪玉先放心不下，她一把拉住李秋林，说：“咱们插小路快到区政府，去找妇幼保健员郭兰珍。”俩个人越过一个山坡，跑到区里，人还没到，倪玉先的声音先到啦，“妇幼保健员郭兰珍，你们谁看到她咯？”“石塘乡打电话来，有个灾民快生毛毛（小孩），接到电话，郭兰珍背起她那个小包，就跑出去啦！”一个区干部告诉她。“走，我们插小路去截她！”倪玉先说罢，便头前走了。快到乡政府的岔路上，郭兰珍也急急忙忙地走过来了。“老郭，我们正找你哩，快走吧！”倪玉先高兴地说。
    范家茶铺实际上只有两个房间，外间是灶房，内一间是住室，王金莲一家四口睡在里边。倪玉先和接生员郭兰珍赶到茶铺，王金莲正向邓郁莲解释：让邓郁莲在她的床上生毛毛，她和两个小孩另搭个铺睡，她丈夫人熟地熟，可以到邻居家去住，总之，一切都不用着急。邓郁莲却执意不肯，怕生毛毛弄脏了王家的床铺。倪玉先考虑：既然邓郁莲执意不肯弄脏王家的床铺，另搭个铺也方便。于是，大家忙着在大床旁搭铺，郭兰珍忙着整理接生的用具。邓郁莲也早有准备，生产用的草纸、布片……连小孩的小衣裳也带出来了。她说，多亏有个好政府。要是在伪政府时，发大水，东西冲走，人逃命还顾不上。今年，水一个劲涨，政府派轮船把我们从危险堤段接出来，这些零碎东西也带出来了。
    邓郁莲一个劲发虚汗，她难受的那个光景，叫人替她着急。倪玉先忽然想起，她们早晨从城里来，转移的路上诸多不便，怕还空着肚子哩，吃点东西，或许会好些。她说：“我只顾乱忙，忘记了问你吃饭了没有，去给你做点饭。”妇幼保健员郭兰珍也说，吃点东西，对“生产”有帮助。倪玉先便快步返回乡政府，乡政府对这件事很关心，决定从急赈粮中拨出二斤米，送给邓郁莲。倪玉先口袋里有
  一千块钱，想给孕妇买几个鸡蛋，乡政府胡秘书知道了，也说：“我身上还有一千元，你也拿上吧，好多买几个鸡蛋。”妇女会员周大秀说：“买鸡蛋这个事，交给我办，妇女主任，你还是照看生毛毛的妇女去吧！”周大秀跑了几个“屋场”〔注二〕，只因为暑天天热，鸡不下蛋，没有买到。这里没有，她跑到那里，她沿着起伏的坡路，跑的满头大汗，终于买到了两个鸡蛋。周大秀又把烹好的鸡蛋和热腾腾的麦粉粑粑，一起送到邓郁莲跟前。
    下午四点左右，婴儿的哇哇哭声从内屋里传出来，坐在隔壁灶房的杨培先紧皱的眉头顿时舒展开来，心里的一块“石头”落地了。王金莲从内屋里走出来，告诉老杨：“蛮好的一个毛毛，他的哭声蛮大咯！”倪玉先、郭兰珍也走出来了，杨培先面对着倪玉先、王金莲、郭兰珍，不知道该怎样感谢她们。“这个毛毛，真是毛主席的人噢！”他很激动地说，“我有过两个伢子（儿子），都没得救，
  一个是小产了，一个是生下来几个月就死了。我们俩都是快四十岁的人了，这次又逢上百年没有的大水，在伪政府时，会成个什么样，想都不敢想啊，不要说毛毛，大人怕也保不住。现在，毛主席领导好，人民政府关心人民，干部好，群众也好。倪主任、王家嫂子为我们忙了一天，区里派来接生员。我这个伢子有福气，他真是毛主席的人咯！”
    一个胖胖的毛毛平安地生下了，周大秀正想着：大人生下毛毛，身体虚，该吃些好饭。另一个妇女会员田喜珍，听说有个灾民妇女路上生了毛毛，把保存多日的一个鸡蛋亲自送来了，这使周大秀很高兴。她把前些日子小儿子生病时买的猪油取出来，又给邓郁莲做了一顿香气喷喷的蛋炒白米饭。
    邻近的灾民听说杨培先屋里生了个胖的毛毛，纷纷来道喜。听到贺喜的人夸毛毛好，老杨喜得合不上嘴，一面忙着让大家吃喜烟（毛毛生下后，他特地到里多路远的合作社买来的）一面口中讲着：
  “这个伢子，是毛主席的人咯！”
    已经半夜了。乡政府的干部们才把这一天的工作——迎接和接待灾区农民兄弟的工作——结束。倪玉先走出乡政府，还像有一件事没办完似的，想起来了，“生下毛毛的妈妈，多吃几餐饭才好。”于是，她又煮了一大碗细米稀饭，向着范家茶铺走去。这时，人们已安歇了，她喊开了门，把稀饭递给睡在外间的杨培先，让邓郁莲醒来时，再吃餐稀饭。
    倪玉先走出范家茶铺。她一身轻松，清风阵阵从田间吹来扑鼻的稻米香，她浸沉在一种说不出的愉快里。……当她走近家门前一簇葱笼的树丛前的时候才发觉：“一里半路，怎么这样快来到屋里了。”
      注一：当地曾有一种传说，在谁家屋里生小孩，谁家便要倒霉。
      注二：此地，村落很分散，几户人家住在一起，叫一个“屋场”，称某某屋场或大屋。
