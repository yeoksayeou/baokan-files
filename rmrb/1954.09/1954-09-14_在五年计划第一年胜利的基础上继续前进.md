    Continuing to Advance on the Basis of Victory in the First Year of the Five-Year Plan

    The State Statistical Bureau of the Central People's Government has published a communique on the results of the 1953 National Economic Development and State Plan Execution. This communique records the great achievements of the first year of our country's first Five-Year Plan, marking a step forward in our country's socialist industrialization construction and socialist transformation.

    The first result of the successful completion of the 1953 national economic plan is the further development of our industrial construction and industrial production, the further increase in the proportion of industry in the national economy, and the increase in the proportion of the total output value of modern industry in the total output value of industry and agriculture from about 28 percent in 1952 to about 31 percent in 1953. In the total industrial output value, the proportion of the total output value of means of production increased from 40 percent in 1952 to 42 percent in 1953. In this year, 114 major projects were started or continued to be under construction in terms of capital construction, and 36 major projects were put into production in whole or in part. Although there were more difficulties after entering the construction period, and the base number of industrial production increased year by year, the total industrial output value of the country in 1953 still increased by 33 percent compared with 1952, of which the state-owned industry increased by 40 percent. Although agricultural production also experienced relatively serious natural disasters, it was still slightly higher than in 1952.

    Another result of the successful completion of the 1953 national economic plan is the further growth of our socialist economic strength, and some new achievements have also been made in the cause of socialist transformation. In the total industrial output value of the country, the proportion of state-owned industry has increased from 51 percent in 1952 to 53 percent in 1953; the proportion of cooperative and joint state-private industrial output value has increased from 8 percent in 1952 to 9 percent in 1953. The number of handicraft production cooperatives increased by 43 percent compared with 1952, and the total output value increased by 76 percent. Agricultural production cooperatives increased from 3,663 in 1952 to more than 14,900 in 1953. The proportion of state-owned and cooperative commercial enterprises in the total wholesale volume of commodities in the domestic market has increased from about 64 percent in 1952 to about 70 percent in 1953. Due to the continuous growth of socialist economic strength, the consolidation and development of our people's democratic system is more guaranteed, and the material foundation for our transition to socialism is also gradually increasing.

    With the development of national construction and industrial and agricultural production, the material and cultural living standards of the people across the country have also improved. In 1953, the total number of employees in various economic sectors across the country increased by about 15 percent compared with 1952, and the average wage of employees in state-owned and joint state-private industrial enterprises increased by about 5 percent compared with 1952. The state constructed approximately 12 million square meters of residential buildings for employees. The number of employees enjoying labor insurance benefits and the income of labor insurance funds have both increased compared with 1952. The state issued a total of 12 trillion yuan in agricultural loans, an increase of 40 percent compared with 1952; the state lent 160,000 waterwheels. The total value of production materials supplied to farmers by supply and marketing cooperatives increased by 56 percent compared with 1952. Cultural, educational, and health construction also saw further development compared with 1952.

    However, these achievements are only a step forward for the great cause of socialist construction. To transform our country from a backward agricultural country into an advanced socialist industrial country, the people of the whole country still need to work hard for a long time. Therefore, we must oppose any complacency and continue to carry out various construction undertakings unremittingly and with redoubled efforts. The current specific task is to strive to comprehensively fulfill and overfulfill the national plan for 1954.

    At present, in terms of capital construction, although the workload completed by the fifteen ministries of the central government in the first half of this year increased by 57 percent compared with the same period last year, many important projects have not completed the original plan, and most projects rely on efforts in the second half of the year to complete. In terms of industrial production, the five industrial ministries of the central government have completed 52 percent of the annual plan in the first half of the year; however, poor quality and frequent accidents are still serious shortcomings in production, especially the trial production plans for new products in some departments have not been completed well. In agriculture, although most areas have had a bumper summer harvest, with wheat production increasing by more than 20 percent compared with last year, a considerable area has suffered from unprecedented floods in a century, which has a great impact on the autumn harvest, and the production of grain and cotton may not be able to complete the original production plan. The people of the whole country must make greater efforts to increase production and practice economy, and strive to comprehensively fulfill and overfulfill this year's national plan.

    The economic construction tasks before us require us to continue to work hard on the following tasks:

    First, we must vigorously increase production and improve product quality. In industry, all departments should take concrete measures based on the situation of supply, production, and sales, and strive to complete and exceed the national plan. This requires all enterprises to improve enterprise management based on specific circumstances, universally implement operation plans, improve the responsibility system, gradually bring it to the level that socialist enterprises should have, and continue to strengthen the political work of enterprises, improve the consciousness and labor enthusiasm of all employees, consolidate the labor discipline of enterprises, implement the policy of safe production, strengthen technical leadership, and, on the basis of promoting extensive labor competitions and rationalization proposals, carry out technical innovation movements in a led, planned, and targeted manner, and promote effective advanced experiences. In agriculture, the vast non-disaster areas must strengthen the work of preventing disasters and protecting the autumn harvest, and actively improve field management according to local conditions, adopt methods such as intercropping and late autumn crops, and strive to increase the yield per unit area to compensate for the losses in disaster areas, and strive to overfulfill this year's agricultural production increase plan. Areas that have suffered from waterlogging disasters must quickly carry out drainage, seedling protection, and replanting work, and plant a large number of high-yield late autumn crops, striving to plant more and harvest more; individual areas that cannot be replanted should properly carry out sideline production. Agricultural mutual aid and cooperation organizations must actively lead and unite all farmers to work hard for production and strive for a better harvest.

    Second, we must actively carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, give play to their potential, and increase social production. At present, we should actively strive to run the existing tens of thousands of agricultural production cooperatives and thousands of handicraft production cooperatives well, gain experience, and set examples, so as to make necessary preparations for further carrying out the agricultural collectivization movement and the handicraft collectivization movement. Most of the private industrial enterprises have currently adopted some forms of state capitalism, such as processing, ordering, unified purchase, and exclusive sales, etc., but they should also be encouraged and guided in a planned manner, according to the needs of the country, the possibility of enterprise transformation, and the willingness of capitalists, to transform private industrial enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood into joint state-private enterprises, so as to gradually realize the socialist transformation of private industry. In private commerce, we must also actively and gradually adopt the method of advancing on one side and arranging on the other, according to the specific circumstances, and gradually transform private commerce into various forms of state capitalist commerce, so that the entire commerce can further adapt to the needs of national construction.

    Third, we must continue to expand commodity circulation and stabilize the market. State-owned commercial enterprises and cooperative commercial enterprises must conscientiously do a good job and continue to strengthen the work of planned purchase and planned supply. Actively organize the purchase of grain, industrial raw materials, and non-staple foods to ensure the smooth progress of industrial construction and industrial production; actively organize the supply of means of production and means of livelihood to rural areas and the promotion of agricultural and sideline products. For some products that are in short supply, we should especially strengthen the planning of supply and achieve reasonable allocation. Urban and rural markets must support each other, and non-staple foods should be given priority to large cities and industrial and mining areas, while industrial products needed by both urban and rural areas should be given priority to rural areas. All localities should take measures according to the specific circumstances to smooth the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and revitalize the primary market. At the same time, we must strengthen the management of the market to stabilize prices and ensure the smooth progress of national economic construction.

    Fourth, we must practice strict economy. This is an important political task for the people of the whole country on a regular basis. At a time when the scale of national construction is getting larger and larger, the construction of many projects takes a long time and cannot be put into production in large quantities in the short term, the needs of the country and the people are increasing, and the development of industrial and agricultural production in some aspects cannot keep up with the needs, especially in the case that this year's grain may not be able to complete the original production plan due to the floods in some areas, the significance of the people of the whole country practicing strict economy is even more important. All economic departments should strive to complete and overfulfill plans such as improving labor productivity, reducing costs, and handing over profits and tax plans on the basis of completing and overfulfilling the state production plan, so as to expand the country's income; the consumption quotas for all raw materials, expense standards, staffing and labor organization, the term of capital turnover, the recovery system for waste materials and old products, etc., should be resolutely implemented. Measures such as streamlining administrative organs, reducing redundant personnel, and saving administrative expenses should continue to be implemented so that they can be effective.

    It is hoped that the people of the whole country will unite as one, guard against arrogance and rashness, resolutely obey the state's plan, continue to carry forward the glorious tradition of hard struggle, and overcome all difficulties in the way forward. As long as we do the above tasks well, we will surely be able to continue to advance victoriously on the basis of the victory in the first year of the Five-Year Plan.

    在五年计划第一年胜利的基础上继续前进
    中央人民政府国家统计局公布了一九五三年度国民经济发展和国家计划执行结果的公报。这个公报记载了我国第一个五年计划第一年度的伟大成就，标志着我国的社会主义工业化建设和社会主义改造事业又向前迈进了一步。
    一九五三年国民经济计划胜利完成的第一个结果，就是我国的工业建设和工业生产有了进一步的发展，工业在国民经济中的比重有了进一步的提高，现代工业总产值在工农业总产值中的比重由一九五二年的百分之二十八左右上升到一九五三年的百分之三十一左右。在工业总产值中，生产资料总产值的比重由一九五二年的百分之四十上升到一九五三年的百分之四十二。在这一年中，基本建设方面开始施工和继续施工的重大项目有一百一十四个，全部或部分投入生产的重大项目有三十六个。虽然进入建设时期以后困难较多，工业生产的基数也逐年加大，但是一九五三年全国工业总产值比一九五二年仍然增加了百分之三十三，其中国营工业增加了百分之四十。农业生产虽在较严重的天灾情况下，也还比一九五二年略有提高。
    一九五三年国民经济计划胜利完成的另一个结果，就是我国社会主义经济力量有了进一步的增长，社会主义改造事业也获得一些新的成就。在全国工业总产值中，国营工业的比重已由一九五二年的百分之五十一上升到一九五三年的百分之五十三；合作社营及公私合营工业的比重已由一九五二年的百分之八上升到一九五三年的百分之九。手工业生产合作社的数目比较一九五二年增加了百分之四十三，总产值增加了百分之七十六。农业生产合作社由一九五二年的三千六百六十三个增加为一九五三年的一万四千九百多个。国营和合作社营商业在国内市场商品批发总额中所占比重，已由一九五二年的百分之六十四左右扩大到一九五三年的百分之七十左右。由于社会主义经济力量不断的增长，我国人民民主制度的巩固和发展就更有保证了，我国过渡到社会主义的物质基础也在逐步增长着。
    随着国家建设和工农业生产的发展，全国人民的物质和文化生活水平也有提高。一九五三年全国各经济部门的职工总数比较一九五二年增加了百分之十五左右，国营及公私合营工业企业职工的平均工资比一九五二年约提高了百分之五，国家为职工修建成的住宅建筑面积约为一千二百万平方公尺。享受劳动保险待遇的职工人数和劳动保险基金的收入，都比一九五二年增加了。国家发放的农业贷款共有十二万亿元，比一九五二年增加了百分之四十；国家贷放的水车有十六万辆。供销合作社供应农民的生产资料的总值就比一九五二年增加了百分之五十六。文教卫生建设也比一九五二年有了进
  一步的发展。
    但是，这些成就对于伟大的社会主义建设事业来说，还仅仅是向前迈进了一步。要把我们国家从落后的农业国变为一个先进的社会主义的工业国，还有待于全国人民长时间的艰苦奋斗。因此，我们必须反对任何骄傲自满情绪，应该坚持不懈，再接再厉地进行各种建设事业，而当前的具体任务，就是要努力争取全面完成和超额完成一九五四年的国家计划。
    目前在基本建设方面，中央十五个部本年上半年完成的工作量，虽然比去年同期增加了百分之五十七；但许多重要工程没有完成原订的计划，大部分工程要靠下半年努力完成。工业生产方面，中央五个工业部上半年已完成全年计划的百分之五十二；但质量差、事故多仍是生产中的严重缺点，特别是若干部门的新产品试制计划完成得不好。在农业方面，虽然大部分地区夏收丰盈；小麦比去年增产百分之二十以上；但有相当大的地区遭受百年以来未有的洪水，对秋收的影响很大，粮食和棉花可能完不成原订生产计划。全国人民还必须作更大的努力，增产节约，争取全面完成和超额完成今年的国家计划。
    摆在我们面前的经济建设任务，要求我们继续努力做好下列几项工作：
    第一、要大力增加生产和提高产品质量。在工业方面，各部门应该根据供产销的情况，采取具体措施，力争完成和超过国家计划。这就需要各企业从具体情况出发，改进企业经营管理，普遍推行作业计划，健全责任制度，使它逐步达到社会主义企业应有的水平，并继续加强企业的政治工作，提高全体职工的自觉性和劳动积极性，巩固企业的劳动纪律，贯彻安全生产方针，加强技术领导，并在推动广泛的劳动竞赛和合理化建议的基础上，有领导有计划有目标地开展技术革新运动，推广行之有效的先进经验。在农业方面，广大非灾区必须加强防灾保秋的工作，并因地制宜，积极改进田间管理，采取间种、复种晚秋作物等方法，努力提高单位面积产量，以弥补灾区的损失，争取超额完成今年的农业增产计划。发生水涝灾害的地区，必须迅速进行排涝保苗补种工作，大量种植高产晚秋作物，力争多种多收；个别无法补种的地区，应该妥善地进行副业生产。农业互助合作组织必须积极带动和团结全体农民努力生产，争取更好的收成。
    第二、要积极进行对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，发挥它们的潜力，增加社会生产。目前应积极努力把现有的数万个农业生产合作社和数千个手工业生产合作社办好，取得经验，树立榜样，为进一步开展农业合作化运动和手工业合作化运动作好必要的准备。私营工业目前大部分已采取了国家资本主义的某些形式，如加工、订货、统购、包销等等，但是还应该根据国家的需要、企业改造的可能和资本家的自愿，有计划地鼓励和指导有利于国计民生的私营工业企业转变为公私合营企业，以逐步实现对私营工业的社会主义改造。在私营商业中，目前也必须分别具体情况，积极地逐步地采取一面前进，一面安排的办法，把私营商业逐步改造为各种形式的国家资本主义商业，使整个商业进一步适应国家建设的需要。
    第三、要继续扩大商品流转，并稳定市场。国营商业和合作社商业，必须认真做好并继续加强计划收购和计划供应的工作。积极组织粮食、工业原料和副食品的收购，以保证工业建设和工业生产的顺利进行；积极组织对农村的生产资料、生活资料的供应和农副业产品的推销工作。对某些生产不足的产品，应特别加强供应的计划性，做到合理分配。城乡市场必须互相支援，副食品应优先供应大城市及工矿区，而城乡都需要的工业品，则应优先供应农村。各地要根据具体情况采取措施，畅通城乡物资交流，活跃初级市场。同时要加强对市场的管理，以稳定物价，保证国家经济建设的顺利进行。
    第四、要厉行节约。这是全国人民经常的一项重要政治任务。当此国家建设的规模愈来愈大，许多工程的建设需时颇长，短期内还不能大量投入生产，国家和人民的需要则愈来愈多，而工农业生产的发展在某些方面还赶不上需要，特别是今年的粮食因部分地区遭受水灾而可能完不成原订生产计划的情况下，全国人民厉行节约的意义就更加重要了。各经济部门应在完成和超额完成国家生产计划的基础上，争取完成和超额完成提高劳动生产率、降低成本、利润上缴等计划和税收计划，以扩大国家的收入；对于一切原材料的消耗定额、费用开支标准、人员编制和劳动组织、资金周转的期限，废料、旧品的回收制度等等，都应坚决执行。关于精简行政机构、减少冗员、节省行政费开支等措施，应继续贯彻，务使收到成效。
    希望全国人民团结一致，戒骄戒躁，坚决服从国家的计划，继续发扬艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，克服前进中的一切困难。只要我们作好了以上各项工作，我们就一定能在五年计划第一年的胜利基础上，继续胜利前进。
