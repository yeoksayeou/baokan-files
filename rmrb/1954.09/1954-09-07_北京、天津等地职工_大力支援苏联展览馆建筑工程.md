Workers in Beijing, Tianjin, and other places
Vigorously support the construction of the Soviet Exhibition Center
[Our Newspaper] The magnificent and splendid Soviet Exhibition Center, under the direct guidance of Soviet construction and engineering experts, has been completed in less than a year from the start of construction. This is a rare event in China's construction history.

During the construction of the Soviet Exhibition Center, dozens of units at the central level in Beijing, at the Beijing municipal level, and in other districts provided strong support in terms of manpower and materials. Many units at the central level transferred many experienced design and construction engineers, technicians, and administrative management cadres here; the Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau drew a large number of technical cadres and outstanding workers, labor models, and advanced groups from its twelve engineering companies and affiliated factories to participate in the work. The Ministry of Railways and the Beijing Railway Administration under it organized a special organization to be responsible for completing the transportation tasks related to the exhibition hall.

Workers in other regions also actively supported the construction project. The Tianjin Municipal Finance Committee led sixteen factories in Tianjin to form a "Technical Research Group" dedicated to metal processing for the decoration of the Soviet Exhibition Center. Jingdezhen City, Jiangxi Province, organized eleven large-scale porcelain factories to establish a "Soviet Exhibition Center Porcelain Production Group" to process porcelain, and two art experts provided technical guidance. Tianjin No. 5 Machinery Factory supplied the new product dust collectors, and Yingkou Machinery Factory in Northeast China supplied radiators, etc.

The workers on the construction site of the Soviet Exhibition Center carried forward the spirit of internationalism and a high degree of labor enthusiasm. After the project started last year, it soon entered the severe winter. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, the workers overcame the severe cold, carried out winter construction, and ensured that the concrete did not freeze during the initial setting period, completing the entire structural project and playing a huge role in shortening the overall construction period. The construction of the gilded iron tower and red five-pointed star weighing more than 20 tons above the central hall of the exhibition hall was a difficult project. Workers at the Fengtai Bridge Factory undertook the construction of the tall iron tower. The tower body was made up of twenty-one sections, which had to be welded together section by section after completion. When welding, workers had to drill into the iron tower. Young welder Zhou Liange and several partners insisted on working at high altitude for more than ten days to complete the welding task. Workers at the Beijing Metal Crafts Factory completed the gold plating of the iron tower three days ahead of schedule using the gilding method. Several old workers had not done this kind of work for thirty or forty years, and this time they came specially from their hometowns. Zhang Lizhao, a 73-year-old master, said: "The Soviet Union has given us too much help, even though I am old, I still have to come and participate in this work." It was also very difficult to manufacture the three-meter-high red five-pointed star glass. Workers Zhou Lin and Gu Amao bravely accepted the trial production task. He came up with many methods and experimented twelve times, finally producing glass with bright colors, resistant to storms, and resistant to fire (the five-pointed star is equipped with one hundred and twenty electric lights).

The art terrazzo floors in the central hall, the cultural hall, and the agricultural hall, the floor-to-ceiling steel windows in the cultural hall, the carved bronze doors in the central hall, the light green marble wainscoting in the restaurant, as well as the six to seven-meter to twelve-meter-high, one-ton ornate chandeliers and exquisite plaster ornaments in the main halls, are all very eye-catching. Workers at the Shanghai Steel Window Factory supplied all the steel windows required here, workers at the Shenyang Mining Factory processed the crimson and light green marble, workers at the Changchun Marble Factory and Shenyang Marble Factory processed the terrazzo, and handicraft workers at the Beijing Hardware Production Cooperative processed the copper ornaments and many delicate artistic processes. Chinese construction experts, artists, plaster carvers, floral workers, and stonemasons also participated in various decoration works.

More than 39,000 bushes of flowers and more than 6,000 trees carefully selected from all over the country in the exhibition hall garden also present a green scene.

    北京、天津等地职工
    大力支援苏联展览馆建筑工程
    【本报讯】宏伟、瑰丽的苏联展览馆，在苏联建筑和施工专家直接指导下，从开始兴建到完工，前后还不到一年。这在我国建筑史上是一件稀有的事。
    在苏联展览馆施工中，北京中央一级、北京市一级以及其他区的几十个单位，在人力、物力方面给予了大力的支援。中央一级很多单位，把许多有经验的设计和施工工程师、技师和行政管理干部输送到这里；北京市建筑工程局从所属十二个工程公司和附属工厂中，抽调了大批技术干部和优秀工人、劳动模范和先进小组等参加工区工作。中央铁道部和所属北京铁路管理局组织了专门机构，负责完成有关展览馆的运输任务。
    其他地区的职工，也积极支援了建筑工程。天津市财委会领导天津十六个工厂组成了“技术研究小组”，专为苏联展览馆的装饰进行金属加工。江西景德镇市组织了十一个较大规模的瓷厂，成立了“苏联展览馆用瓷制作小组”，进行瓷器加工，并有两位美术专家进行技术指导。天津第五机械厂供应了新产品滤尘器，东北营口机械厂则供应了散热器等。
    苏联展览馆工地上的工人们，发扬了国际主义精神和高度的劳动热情。去年工程动工后，不久便进入严寒的冬天。职工们在苏联专家的指导下，战胜严寒，进行冬季施工，并使混凝土在初凝期内没有受冻，完成了全部结构工程，对缩短整个工期起了巨大作用。修建展览馆中央大厅上面重量达二十多吨的镏金铁塔和红五星，工程是艰巨的。丰台桥梁工厂的工人们，承做了高大的铁塔。塔身共二十一节，做好后要一节一节焊接起来。在焊接时工人必须钻在铁塔里。青年焊工周连葛和几个伙伴，坚持高空作业达十多天，完成了焊接任务。北京市金属工艺工厂工人们用镏金法提前三天完成了铁塔的镀金任务。有几个老工人已经三、四十年不做这种活了，这次特从家乡赶来。七十三岁的老师傅张立兆说：“苏联对我们的帮助太大了，我虽然老了，也要赶来参加这个工作。”制造三公尺多高的红五星玻璃，困难也是很多的。工区工人周林和顾阿毛勇敢地接受了试制任务。他想出了许多办法，试验了十二次，终于制成了颜色鲜艳、不怕暴风雨、又经得住火烤（五星内装有一百二十盏电灯）的玻璃。
    中央大厅、文化馆和农业馆内的美术水磨石的地面，文化馆的落地长钢窗，中央大厅雕花的铜门，餐厅内浅绿色的大理石的护壁，以及主要各馆内高六、七公尺到十二公尺、重一吨左右的花式大吊灯和精致的石膏花饰等等，都是非常引人注目的。上海钢窗厂的工人为这里供应了全部所需的钢窗，沈阳矿业厂的工人加工了紫红色和浅绿色的大理石，长春大理石厂和沈阳大理石厂的工人进行了水磨石的加工，北京市五金生产合作社手工艺工人进行了铜质花饰加工和许多细致的艺术加工。参加各种装饰工作的，还有我国的建筑专家、美术家以及石膏雕刻工、花饰工和石工等。
    展览馆庭园内从全国各地精选来的三万九千多丛花卉和六千多棵树木，也都呈现一片绿色。
