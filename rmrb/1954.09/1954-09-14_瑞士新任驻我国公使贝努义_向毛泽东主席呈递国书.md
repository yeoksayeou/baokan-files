Mr. Chairman of the Central People's Government:

I have the honor to present to Your Excellency the Letter of Credence from the Federal Government appointing me as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of the Swiss Confederation to reside near you, and the Letter of Recall of my predecessor. Please allow me to convey to you the greetings of the Federal President and wishes for the prosperity of the people of the People's Republic of China. I tell you with all my heart: How happy and honored I personally feel to assume the post of Swiss Minister to the People's Republic of China.

Your Excellency knows that Switzerland, a country with a long history of democracy, is willing to live in peace with all countries in the world and contribute to the happiness of all nations. My government attaches great importance to maintaining the existing good relations between the people of China and Switzerland. I hope to further enhance the friendly friendship between the People's Republic of China and the Swiss Confederation in the future. In this spirit, I am pleased to recall the friendly letter from Premier Zhou Enlai, as the chief representative of the Chinese delegation, to our government during his recent stay in Switzerland.

In fulfilling the mission entrusted to me, I hope to obtain your support and the kind assistance of your government. Now I would like to express my warm thanks to you, Mr. Chairman, in advance.

Chairman Mao Zedong's reply:

Mr. Minister:

I am very pleased to accept the Letter of Credence of the Swiss Federal Council presented by Your Excellency, and I thank you for the congratulations conveyed by the Swiss Federal President to the people of the People's Republic of China and to myself personally.

Over the past five years, the friendly relations between China and Switzerland have been enhanced on the basis of peaceful coexistence. During the Geneva Conference, the delegation of the People's Republic of China received the hospitality and assistance of the Swiss Government and people, and I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude. In the future, economic ties and cultural exchanges between China and Switzerland will be further enhanced, which will not only benefit the development of friendship between the two peoples but also help consolidate world peace.

I warmly welcome Your Excellency to assume the post of Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of the Swiss Confederation to the People's Republic of China, and in your work to strengthen friendly cooperation between China and Switzerland, you will certainly receive the assistance of myself and the Government of the People's Republic of China.

I wish you success in your work and wish your people happiness and your head of state good health.
