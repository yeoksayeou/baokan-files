    Pure and Authentic Classical Music Art
    —Listening to the Performance of the Delegation of Artists from the German Democratic Republic
    Li Ling, Standing Director of the Chinese Musicians Association

    The delegation of artists from the German Democratic Republic recently held performances in our capital and other cities. These artists, from the homeland of the great musician Beethoven, profoundly introduced the world-renowned German classical composers Bach, Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann, Weber, Brahms, Wagner and others' classic works to the Chinese audience with their superb artistic skills. This rare opportunity strongly attracted the audience in the capital. The German Democratic Republic's sending such excellent artists to our country to introduce their rich and beautiful classical music art fully demonstrates the German people's respect and deep friendship for the Chinese people. Just as the rulers of capitalist countries are frantically spreading formalism music to the world, the significance of German musicians working so hard to protect and introduce these great classical music is even greater.

    The Chinese people, especially Chinese musicians, hold the German excellent music tradition and the German great classical composers' outstanding contributions to music in high esteem. Their works have spread in our country very early and are loved by the people. Now, through the interpretation of their own national artists, we have a better understanding of the spiritual outlook of these composers' works.

    The Elben String Quartet, the visiting artist delegation this time, is one of the eight most famous quartet ensembles in Germany. It is a quartet organization that often performs at the Berlin German State Opera. At the opening performance in our capital, they performed five exceptionally wonderful programs. Among them, Beethoven's "String Quartet in A Major" (Opus 18, No. 5) was particularly touching. They profoundly expressed the exuberant vitality and joyful emotions of this classical piece.

    They also played Schubert's quartet, which the composer wrote based on one of his songs describing a young girl's struggle against death. The performers, with a highly complete technique, meticulously portrayed the girl's desire for life and the cunning and sinister deception of the girl by death. They paid special attention to the true content of the music and adhered to the composer's complete musical requirements in instrumental performance, embodying the emotions of the music simply and rigorously, and their unexaggerated artistic performance style, which left a deep impression on us.

    Besides being true and profound, the quartet's serious, strict, and highly cooperative cultivation in performance is also admirable. In a duet in Haydn's "String Quartet in C Major" ("Birdsong"), although it was such a simple phrase, they not only cooperated very consistently in rhythm, but also cooperated well in timbre and volume. They showed superb performance skills and integrated cooperation in the fast movements of Haydn's "Birdsong Quartet" and Beethoven's quartet's fourth movement. The cadence and control of the transitions and combinations in the music were like a single person performing. Some comrades visited their rehearsals and were very moved by the artists' meticulous and strict cooperative spirit during rehearsals.

    The first violinist of the quartet, Fr-Karl Elben, showed his extraordinary analytical power of musical phrases in the performance of several pieces. Cellist Fr-Karl Elben especially showed himself to be an artist full of poetic emotion in Schubert's "Piano Trio in B-flat Major"; in Haydn's "Birdsong Quartet", the cello's ingenious opening made people feel unspeakably happy; the entire piece, due to his and other performers' outstanding and very appropriate support, made the theme more distinct. He also performed the first movement of Schubert's "Cello Sonata in A Minor" another evening, where he showed himself to be a passionate, profound, and cultured musician.

    The audience showed great love for the young female singer Rothe Käberlin's singing. She sang Mozart's "Longing for Spring" freshly and beautifully; she also thoughtfully performed Beethoven's "I Love You." Her voice was so pure and deeply grasped the heartstrings of the audience. When singing Mozart's "Ah! Do not hesitate anymore!" (selection from the opera "The Marriage of Figaro"), the yearning melody was sung with deep affection.

    Female singer Rothe Glowa is a famous actor at the German Dresden State Opera. She is a relatively dramatic soprano, but her talents are multifaceted. Her singing of Schumann's "Moonlit Night" depicted a simple and peaceful song so movingly that the audience couldn't help but praise it. She performed Schubert's "The Trout" in a wild and unrestrained manner; she delicately expressed the happy scene of the trout swimming lively in the green stream, and she also highlighted the greedy and sinister face of the fisherman with passionate singing, so that the audience repeatedly asked her to sing it again.

    Baritone singer Karl Paul sang Schubert's "You Are Like a Flower" and "Serenade." In "You Are Like a Flower," he used pure and beautiful singing to express the appearance of a beloved person like a pure and fragrant flower; in "Serenade," he beautifully revealed that "soft plea"; the control of the voice had extremely high cultivation.

    The greatest characteristic of several vocalists, like all German singers, is that they are exceptionally faithful to the content and musical requirements of the songs, without any exaggeration, and pay special attention to the accuracy of the song's language. In their singing, they rarely sacrifice the clarity of words to maintain a certain mouth shape. Some German phonetic endings, such as "斯特", even though the melody is about to fade away, they still strictly sing it completely. Clear pronunciation and perfect grammar are important factors in expressing the thoughts and emotions of songs. Their serious attitude towards grammar is worthy of serious study by our vocal workers.

    The deepest impression that the entire artist delegation's performance gave us was their true and pure performance style in performance creation. We deeply thank our friends for bringing such beautiful performances and valuable artistic experience, and also congratulate them on achieving greater success in their performances in various parts of our country.

    纯朴真实的古典音乐艺术
    ——听德意志民主共和国艺术家代表团的演出
    中国音乐家协会常务理事　李凌
    德意志民主共和国艺术家代表团最近来我国首都及其他城市举行演出。这些来自世界伟大音乐家贝多芬的祖国的艺术家们，以他们精湛的艺术技巧，深刻地向中国观众介绍了世界著名的德国古典作曲家巴赫、海登、莫扎尔特、贝多芬、舒伯特、舒曼、韦伯、勃拉姆斯、华格纳等人的经典作品。这个如此难得的机会，强烈地吸引着首都的听众。德意志民主共和国派遣这样优秀的艺术家来我国介绍他们丰富、优美的古典音乐艺术，充分说明了德国人民对中国人民的尊敬和深厚的友谊。正当资本主义国家的统治者疯狂地向世界传播形式主义音乐的时候，德国音乐家们这样辛劳地保护和介绍这些伟大的古典音乐的意义，就更加重大了。
    中国人民，特别是中国的音乐工作者对德国优秀的音乐传统，对德国伟大的古典作曲家在音乐上杰出的贡献，怀着极高的敬意。他们的作品，很早就在我国传播，并受到人民的热爱。而今，经由他们本国的艺术家亲自演出解释，使我们对这些作曲家作品的精神风貌就有了更进一步的了解。
    这次访华艺术家代表团的艾尔本弦乐四重奏组，是德国最著名的八个四重奏乐团之一。它是柏林德国国家歌剧院经常演出的四重奏组织。在我国首都开幕演出会上，他们表演了五个异常精彩的节目。其中贝多芬的“A大调弦乐四重奏”（作品十八，第五号）特别使人感动，他们深刻地表现了这支古典乐曲的充沛活力和欢乐情感。
    他们还演奏了舒伯特的四重奏，这是作曲家根据他的一首描写年青的姑娘向死神挣扎的歌曲写成的弦乐变奏曲。演奏家们以高度完整的手法，细致地刻划了姑娘对生的渴望和死神狡猾、险恶地欺骗少女的情景。他们在器乐演奏上这种特别注意乐曲的真实内容和忠于作曲家的完整的音乐要求，质朴地、严谨地体现乐曲的情感，以及毫不夸张的艺术表演创造作风，给我们留下极深的印象。
    四重奏乐团的特点，除了真实、深刻以外，他们演奏上的认真、严格和高度的合作修养也是令人惊服的。在海登的“C大调弦乐四重奏”（“鸟声”）中的一段二人合奏，虽然是这样简单的乐句，他们不仅在节奏上配合得非常一致，而且在音色、音量上也合作得很好。他们在海登的“鸟声四重奏”曲和贝多芬的四重奏第四乐章的快速乐段，都表现出演奏技巧的炉火纯青，和合作上的融合一体。乐曲中的抑扬顿挫，起接转合的地方控制得像一个人在演出。有些同志曾参观他们的练习，对于这些艺术家在排练中一丝不苟的严格合作精神非常感动。
    四重奏乐团的第一提琴手弗—卡尔·艾尔本，在好几支乐曲表演中都表现出他对乐句有着非凡的分析力。大提琴家弗—卡尔·艾尔本在舒伯特的“降B大调钢琴三重奏”中特别显出他是一个内心充满诗情的艺术家；在海登的“鸟声四重奏”中，大提琴的巧妙起音，使人感到说不出的愉快；整个乐曲，由于他和其他演奏者的杰出和非常适当的烘托，使主题更加鲜明。他在另一个晚上还表演了舒伯特的“A小调大提琴奏鸣曲”的第一乐章，在这里更加显出他是一个热情的、深邃的、有修养的音乐家。
    听众对年青的女歌唱家罗特·凯贝琳的演唱寄以极大的热爱，她歌唱莫扎尔特的“渴望春天”清新而优美；她还体贴入微地表演了贝多芬的“我爱你”。她的歌声如此纯清，深深抓住听众的心弦。在歌唱莫扎尔特的“啊！不要再犹豫了！”（歌剧“费迦洛婚礼”选曲）时，那渴望的乐调，歌唱得一往情深。
    女歌唱家罗特·格洛娃，是德国德累斯顿国家歌剧院的名演员。她是一个比较戏剧性的女高音，但她的才艺却是多方面的。她歌唱舒曼的“月夜”，把一首简朴而宁静的歌曲描绘得如此动人，使听众赞叹不止。她演唱舒伯特的“鳟鱼”一曲，却表演得犷野泼辣；她细致地表现了鳟鱼活泼地在碧绿的溪水中游来游去的快乐情景，她也以激情的歌声把渔夫的贪婪、险恶面貌突出地刻划出来，以致听众再三要求她重唱。
    男中音歌唱家卡尔·保尔演唱了舒伯特的“你像一朵花”和“小夜曲”。在“你像一朵花”中，他以纯美的歌声表现了心爱的人像纯洁清香的花朵一样的风貌；在“小夜曲”中，他优美地吐露出那“轻轻的恳求”；声音的控制，有极高修养。
    几个声乐家的最大特点，像所有的德国歌唱家一样，异常忠实于歌曲的内容和音乐要求，丝毫不夸张，对歌曲语言的准确性也特别注意。在他们的演唱中，绝少为了保持某种口形而牺牲词句的清晰。有些德国语音的语尾像“斯特”等，虽然临到旋律音将要消逝，他们仍然严格地把它完整地歌唱出来。清晰的语音和完美的语法，是表达歌曲思想情感的重要因素，他们这种处理语法的严肃态度，是值得我们声乐工作者认真学习的。
    整个艺术家代表团的演出，给我们最深的印象的是他们在表演创作上真实、纯朴的演奏作风。我们深深感谢我们的朋友带来如许优美的表演和宝贵的艺术经验，同时也祝贺他们在我国各地的演出获得更大的成功。
