The Completed Soviet Exhibition Center
By Our Correspondent Fu Dong

September 10th, the weather was fine. The Soviet Exhibition Center construction site appeared unusually quiet. The crowded throngs and vehicles transporting construction materials were no longer seen on the roadsides and the plaza in front. This indicates to people that the major part of the Soviet Exhibition Center's construction project has been successfully completed.

People see the golden glittering spires and red stars from afar, as if they have personally arrived in Moscow. Aren't those the spires and red stars of the Kremlin? A distance of over ten thousand li has vanished. People feel: the Kremlin is right in front of us, the Soviet people are right beside us.

Upon entering the plaza, one immediately sees a fountain with a diameter of forty-four meters. In the center of the pool is a lotus-shaped water outlet, constructed of pink granite; each petal has ten spouts, and when the water flows, the crystal clear water sprays can reach a height of more than fifteen chi.

On the east and west sides of the exhibition center is a gentle expanse of green. Countless bright red "Salvia splendens" and Amur maples, junipers, and weeping Chinese locust trees are dotted on the green lawns. These green grass, red flowers, and jade-green roofs, along with the sparkling large glass windows, complement each other, giving people an indescribable feeling of freshness and joy.

The spire on the central hall pierces the sky, giving a sense of majesty and solemnity. On both sides of the main entrance are sixteen semicircular arches, above which hang the national emblems of the sixteen Soviet republics. On the central tower, one can clearly see the Soviet national emblem and the golden "CCCP," as well as the laurel leaves symbolizing honor. The outer walls are all painted a light yellow, with a slight hint of white, as if covered with a light layer of frost. Above the arches of the central hall are many exquisite carvings. These beautiful carvings reflect the lives and lofty ideals of the Soviet people.

This magnificent building demonstrates the strength of the Chinese and Soviet people, and also demonstrates the deep friendship between the two countries. It makes everyone feel optimistic, feel the joy of life, and feel the greatness of labor.

The seats in the huge circular open-air theater have already been installed. Around the theater is a six-meter-wide corridor, with two tall pagodas standing on both sides. The newly planted delicate trees and underground flowers and plants make the theater exceptionally beautiful. The lake behind the theater has already been filled with clear water; in the future, when people are tired, they can go to the pavilion in the lake to cool off. Between the small lake and the theater, there is a railway track, through which huge machines and all kinds of exhibits are directly transported from Moscow.

In the northeast corner of the exhibition center, the newly built office buildings, dormitories, and cold storage facilities are mostly completed. The slender river on the north side, like a silver ribbon, wraps around the outside of the center. Stretching out on the south side are the newly built wide roads and parking lots. In the southwest corner, houses have been built one after another. After the opening of the Soviet Economic and Cultural Achievements Exhibition, people will be able to buy Soviet-made wines, cigarettes, various cultural goods, and books and periodicals here.

The entrance to the main gate of the exhibition center has been cleaned spotless, and even the tree-lined roads beside it have very little dust. Only the east and west plazas are crowded with workers, who are busily installing or test-running machines. Standing under the long corridors on both sides of the industrial hall, one can hear the rumbling of the machines turning. There, people can also see Soviet experts sweating, walking back and forth under the hot sun, guiding workers to carry out installation work.

### 完工后的苏联展览馆

    完工后的苏联展览馆
    本报记者　傅冬
    九月十日，天气晴朗。苏联展览馆工地上显得异样的宁静，两旁的路上和前面的广场上已看不到拥挤的人群和搬运建筑材料的车马。这向人们表示着：苏联展览馆建筑工程的大部分已胜利完成了。
    人们从远处见到了金光闪闪的尖塔和红星，仿佛亲身到了莫斯科一样。这不是克里姆林宫的尖塔和红星吗？一万多里的距离消失了，人们感到：克里姆林宫就在我们的面前，苏联人民就在我们的身边。
      一进广场，就看见一个直径四十四公尺的喷水池。池中有一个莲花形的喷口，它用粉红色花岗石筑成；每个花瓣上有十个喷口，通水以后，那晶莹的水花，可扬起一丈五尺多高。
    展览馆的东西两侧，是一片轻柔的绿色。在那绿色的草地上，点缀着无数红艳艳的“一串红”和元宝枫、桧柏、龙爪槐。这些绿色的草、红色的花和碧绿色的屋顶、闪闪发光的大玻璃窗交相辉映，使人感到有说不出的清新愉快。
    中央大厅上的尖塔高插云霄，给人以一种威严、肃穆的感觉。大门的两边，是半圆形的十六个拱门，上边悬挂着苏联十六个加盟共和国的国徽。在正中的塔身上，人们可以清楚地看到苏联国徽和那金色的“CCCP”，也可以看到那象征荣誉的桂树叶子。外面墙上都粉刷了一层淡黄色，稍带点儿白色，好像轻轻地盖上了一层冰霜似的。中央大厅的拱门上面有许多精美的雕刻。这些美丽的雕刻，反映了苏联人民的生活和远大的理想。
    这座宏伟的建筑，显示了中苏两国人民的力量，也显示了中苏两国人民的深厚友谊。它使每一个人感到乐观，感到生命的欢腾，感到劳动的伟大。
    巨大的圆形露天剧场上，座位已安装就绪。剧场周围有一条宽六公尺的走廊，两旁耸立着两个高大的宝塔。新栽的娇嫩的树和地下的花草，把剧场衬托得格外美丽。剧场后面的湖里，已经灌进了清水；将来，人们走累了，可以到湖中的小亭去息凉。在小湖和剧场中间，有一条铁路轨道，通过它，巨大的机器和各种各样的展览品由莫斯科直接运来。
    在展览馆的东北角，新盖的办公大楼、宿舍和冷藏库已经大半完工。正北面那条细长的河，仿佛一条银色的缎带绕在馆外。在正南面伸展着的是新修成的宽阔的马路、停车场。西南角，修起了一座一座的房子。苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会开幕以后，人们将在这里买到苏联制造的酿酒、烟卷、各种文化用品和书刊等。
    展览馆正门入口处，已打扫得干干净净，就连旁边林荫道也很少尘土。只有东西广场上挤满了工人，他们正在紧张地安装或试运转机器。人们站在工业馆两旁的长廊下，就可以听到隆隆的机器转动声。在那儿，人们还可以看见苏联专家挥着汗，在大太阳光下走来走去，指导工人进行安装工作。
