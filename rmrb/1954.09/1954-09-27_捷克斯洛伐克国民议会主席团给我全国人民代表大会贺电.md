On behalf of the National Assembly of Czechoslovakia and the entire Czechoslovak people, the Presidium of the National Assembly of the Czechoslovak Republic congratulates you on completing the historically significant task of formulating the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. We are sincerely delighted and encouraged by this proud victory achieved by your people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party; this victory has realized the aspirations of the Chinese people for thousands of years, guaranteeing your country's freedom, sovereignty, and the strong development of its national economy and culture. We admire the fruits achieved by the Chinese people with their creative genius and labor. In a short period after liberation, the Chinese people have raised their country to the advanced ranks of progressive humanity in the world. Please accept our gratitude for the great cause of People's China, which, together with the Soviet Union, resolutely promotes the cause of defending peace, repels and crushes the attacks of the forces of war, and establishes a solid foundation for the peaceful cooperation of your people with the people of all countries in the world. Your achievements and victories are also the achievements and victories of the Czechoslovak people, because your achievements and victories are a help to us in building a new society and defending world peace. We wish the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China and all the Chinese people many achievements in the creative labor of building the motherland and in the struggle to defend world peace.
