Xinhua News Agency, September 5th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, September 4th: Over a thousand political prisoners detained in Hanoi's Central Prison began a hunger strike on the morning of September 3rd—the day the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army completed the handover of all French prisoners of war in North and Central Vietnam—demanding repatriation to the Vietnamese People's Army side.

Among these political prisoners, many had previously participated in political and military activities, and therefore should be released in accordance with the Geneva Armistice Agreement and the agreement reached in Trung Giã. However, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, lackeys of American imperialism and French warmongers, stubbornly claimed that they were ordinary criminals and refused to hand them over to the Vietnamese People's Army, and prepared to transfer them to other prisons.

Their hunger strike has received unanimous support from ordinary prisoners in the prison. On the morning of the 4th, despite the heavy rain, the parents of these political prisoners came to the front of the Hanoi prison to support them. The Ngo Dinh Diem clique dispatched armed police to suppress them and disperse the people.

The struggle of these political prisoners is still continuing.

Xinhua News Agency, September 5th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, September 4th: All French prisoners of war concentrated in Viet Tri unanimously stated when meeting with the delegation of the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Vietnam that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam treated the prisoners of war very well.

The delegation of the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Vietnam, led by Lieutenant Colonel Bagh Singh of India, visited the prisoner of war transfer site in Viet Tri, North Vietnam, on August 30th. Accompanied by representatives of both the Vietnamese People's Army and the French Union forces, the delegation visited the transfer sites in various locations.

Two French officers named Chauvet Gabriel and Rimlaud, who were interviewed by the delegation, unanimously replied: "Here, we are very satisfied, very satisfied!"

Major Millot, the French officer in charge of the handover of Vietnamese People's Army prisoners of war in Viet Tri, said to Lieutenant Colonel Hoang Phuong, the Vietnamese officer in charge of the handover of French prisoners of war: "All French Union forces prisoners of war have told me that they are being treated very well, including those whom I met privately."

Subsequently, the delegation of the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Vietnam also visited Vietnamese detainees released by the French side. Most of them were civilians, and many were women. They described to the delegation the poor treatment they received from the French Union forces.

After collecting sufficient materials, the delegation left Viet Tri for Hanoi on the afternoon of August 30th.

    河内一千多名越南政治犯绝食要求遣返
    在越池的法方战俘受到越南方面的宽大待遇表示十分满意
    【新华社五日讯】据越南通讯社北越四日讯：一千多名被拘在河内中央监狱的政治犯从九月三日——越南人民军总司令部在北越和中越完成移交全部法方战俘的日子——上午起绝食，要求遣返到越南人民军方面去。
    在这些政治犯中，有许多人过去参加了政治和军事活动，因此应该按照日内瓦停战协定和在中稼达成的协议予以释放。但是，美帝国主义和法国好战分子的走狗吴庭艳集团硬说他们是普通犯人，不肯把他们移交给越南人民军，并准备把他们转移到别的监狱中去。
    他们的绝食得到监狱中普通犯人的一致支持。四日上午，尽管雨下得很大，这些政治犯的父母都到河内监狱前面来支援他们。吴庭艳集团派遣武装警察来镇压，并且把人们驱散。
    这些政治犯的斗争现在仍在继续进行。
      【新华社五日讯】据越南通讯社北越四日讯：集中在越池的全体法方战俘在会见越南国际监督和监察委员会代表团时，一致表示越南民主共和国政府对待战俘很好。
    越南国际监督和监察委员会代表团在印度代表巴格·辛格中校率领下于八月三十日访问了北越越池的战俘移交地点。代表团在越南人民军和法兰西联邦部队双方代表陪同之下，对各处的移交地点进行访问。
    受代表团访问的两个名叫萧维·加布里埃尔和任拉勃的法国军官一致回答说：“在这里，我们都十分满意，十分满意！”
    在越池负责移交越南人民军战俘的法国米洛少校对负责移交法方战俘的越南黄芳中校说：“所有法兰西联邦部队战俘都对我说他们受到很好的待遇，其中包括了我个人私下会见的那些人”。
    随后，越南国际监督和监察委员会代表团，也去访问了被法方释放的越方被拘人员。其中大部分是平民，有许多是妇女。他们向代表团叙述了法兰西联邦部队给予他们的恶劣待遇。
    代表团在收集了足够的材料后，已在八月三十日下午离越池前往河内。
