Xinhua News Agency, September 3rd: This afternoon, from approximately 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM, our coastal defense artillery on the Fujian front unleashed a fierce bombardment on the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troop positions on the Greater and Lesser Jinmen Islands, as well as the Chiang Kai-shek naval vessels docked in Jinmen harbor. A large number of artillery shells flew across the strait, landing directly on the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops' positions and vessels. Greater and Lesser Jinmen Islands were engulfed in smoke and fire. Our artillery sank one Chiang Kai-shek naval gunboat, damaged one submarine chaser and one tugboat, destroyed the Shui Tou wharf on Greater Jinmen, and inflicted severe damage on the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troop positions in Guningtou, Greater Jinmen. Under the intense bombardment of our artillery, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops' artillery on Lesser Jinmen were unable to retaliate.

Under the bombardment of our artillery, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops on the islands were extremely panicked, and the surviving Chiang Kai-shek naval vessels fled towards the open sea.

Xinhua News Agency, September 4th: Our anti-aircraft artillery units on the Fujian front shot down and damaged one Chiang Kai-shek Air Force plane each.

At 6:40 AM on the 4th, four Chiang Kai-shek Air Force F-47 fighter planes intruded over our Greater and Lesser Deng Islands, dropping nine bombs before fleeing.

At 7:45 AM the same morning, four Chiang Kai-shek Air Force F-47 fighter planes intruded over our Xiamen Island, dropping two bombs. Our anti-aircraft artillery immediately opened fire, and promptly shot down and damaged one Chiang Kai-shek Air Force plane each. The Chiang Kai-shek Air Force plane that was shot down crashed into the sea.

Prior to this, Chiang Kai-shek Air Force planes had repeatedly harassed our coastal areas of Fujian Province. At 9:07 AM on the 2nd, two Chiang Kai-shek Air Force F-84 fighter planes intruded over Fuzhou to harass; at 9:01 AM on the 3rd, two Chiang Kai-shek Air Force F-84 fighter planes intruded over Xiamen Island to harass.

Xinhua News Agency, September 3rd: On the 2nd, three more soldiers of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops entrenched on Wuqiu Island crossed the sea and surrendered to our army. They are: Zeng Panjiu, 42 years old, from Putian County, Fujian Province; Zhou Chungou, 38 years old, from Putian County, Fujian Province; and Sun Qi, 24 years old, from Ye County, Shandong Province. All three were soldiers of the Chiang Kai-shek Fujian "Anti-Communist National Salvation Army Guerrilla Headquarters" stationed on Wuqiu Island in the "Command Post" or "Military Industry Section Work Group" (all were conscripted by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits before the mainland was liberated). At 1:00 AM on the 2nd, they stole a small sailboat from the southern coast of Lesser Qiu Island and escaped from the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army barracks, arriving at Meizhou Island at 5:00 AM, where they surrendered to our coastal defense troops. They were immediately treated with leniency by our army.

    福建前线我军击落击伤蒋贼飞机各一架
    【新华社三日讯】三日下午二时到四时左右，福建前线我海防炮兵向大、小金门岛的蒋贼军阵地和停泊在金门港内的蒋贼海军舰艇进行猛烈轰击。大批炮弹飞越海峡迳直落在蒋贼军阵地和舰艇上，大小金门岛上一片烟火。我军炮兵共计击沉蒋贼海军炮艇一艘，击伤驱潜舰、拖轮各一艘，击毁大金门水头活动码头一个，并给予大金门古宁头蒋贼军阵地严重破坏。小金门蒋贼军炮兵在我军大炮的猛烈轰击下，毫无还击。
    在我军大炮轰击下，岛上蒋贼军极度慌乱，幸免的蒋贼海军舰艇向远海逃避。
    【新华社四日讯】福建前线我军高射炮部队击落击伤蒋贼空军飞机各一架。
    四日上午六时四十分，蒋贼空军F—四十七型战斗机四架，窜入我大小嶝岛投弹九枚后逸去。
    同日上午七时四十五分，蒋贼空军飞机F—四十七型战斗机四架窜入我厦门岛上空投弹二枚，我高射炮立即开火，当即击落击伤蒋贼空军飞机各一架。被击落的蒋贼空军飞机坠入海中。
    在这次以前，蒋贼空军飞机几次骚扰我福建省沿海地区。二日上午九时七分，蒋贼空军F—八十四型战斗机二架，窜入我福州上空骚扰；三日上午九时一分，蒋贼空军飞机F—八十四型战斗机二架窜入我厦门岛上空进行骚扰。
    【新华社三日讯】二日又有盘踞乌丘屿的蒋贼军三名士兵越海向我军投诚。他们是：曾潘九，四十二岁，福建省莆田县人；周春狗，三十八岁，福建省莆田县人；孙期，二十四岁，山东省掖县人。三人都是蒋贼福建“反共救国军游击总部”驻乌丘屿的“指挥所”或“军工科工作组”的士兵（都是在大陆解放前被蒋贼抓去当兵的）。二日一时，他们在乌丘屿小丘南面海边偷到一只小帆船逃出蒋贼军兵营，晨五时到达我湄州岛，向我海防部队投诚。他们当即受到我军宽大待遇。
