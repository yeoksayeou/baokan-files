Do a Good Job in Frost Prevention to Ensure the Completion of the Production Increase Task
    Rural work cadres and the broad masses of peasants in vast areas are striving with full confidence to over fulfill the task of increasing production. Some areas have already achieved a bumper harvest of early autumn crops, and great achievements have also been made in strengthening field management of existing crops and planting late autumn crops and vegetables. In some disaster-stricken areas, many farmers have also replanted some crops after draining water, striving to reduce and compensate for the losses caused by floods and waterlogging. These are all good phenomena. At present, we should pay attention to not being complacent, not slackening, and continuing the struggle for increased production and harvest to the end. In particular, we should be alert to the possible occurrence of early frost damage.
    According to the forecast of the Central Meteorological Bureau, this year's early frost may come ten days to half a month earlier than in previous years. This year, due to more rain, low temperatures, and less sunshine in the summer, crops in many areas are growing relatively slowly, and the maturity period may be delayed. The crops replanted after drainage in waterlogged areas will be harvested even later. These two factors combined may cause some crops to suffer frost damage. In order to effectively prevent frost damage and ensure the completion of the production increase task, we must pay attention to the following tasks:
    First, we must strengthen weather forecasting and warning work. This is an important link in the fight against frost damage, just as it is necessary to accurately and timely understand the enemy's situation in combat. Local meteorological stations and agricultural departments should cooperate closely with each other in accordance with the "Instructions of the State Council of the Central People's Government on Strengthening the Forecasting, Warning and Prevention of Disaster Weather" to do this work well. Local radio stations, newspapers, and telecommunications bureaus should provide good assistance to this work.
    Second, we must summarize the frost prevention experience of the masses in various places as soon as possible and spread good frost prevention methods. Meteorological workers and agricultural scientists should cooperate closely, use scientific principles to conduct practical summaries of the masses' experience, so that correct methods can be improved and disseminated, and incorrect practices can be corrected. Different regions have different terrains, different crops, and different frost prevention materials that can be used. The most effective and convenient methods should be promoted according to the different needs of each region.
    Third, we must appropriately select the key points of frost prevention and, as far as possible, start with field management for indirect prevention in advance. Because severe frost will spread over a relatively large area once it occurs. If preparations are not made early, it will be impossible to carry out disaster prevention work on every piece of land universally at the last minute, in terms of manpower and materials. Therefore, we must select the crops most susceptible to frost damage and the areas most susceptible to frost damage for key prevention. At present, field management such as pruning and leaf removal and deep plowing should be further strengthened for cotton to promote early maturity. For second-crop tobacco, side shoots should be removed as early as possible, the number of leaves should not be too many, and fertilization should be avoided too late to delay maturity. For sweet potatoes, soil cultivation should be strengthened to cover the seams on the ridges. Field management should also be strengthened for late autumn crops such as buckwheat, and attention should be paid to timely harvesting.
    When carrying out these tasks, it is necessary to conduct political and ideological mobilization of the masses for increased production, and to provide popular explanations of the principles and techniques of frost prevention, so as to prevent any form of coercion and commandism. State-owned farms and agricultural producers' cooperatives should take the lead in doing a good job in frost prevention, lead mutual aid teams and the broad masses, and work together to strive for the final victory in the struggle for increased production and harvest.

### 做好防霜工作，保证完成增产任务

    做好防霜工作，保证完成增产任务
    广大地区的农村工作干部和农民群众，正满怀信心地力争超额完成增产任务：有些地区的早秋作物已经得到了丰收，加强现有作物的田间管理、种植晚秋、菜蔬等作物也有很大成绩；受灾地区也有不少农民在排涝之后补种了一些作物，力求减少和补偿洪水和雨涝所造成的损失。这都是很好的现象。当前应当注意的是不要自满，不要松劲，继续把增产保收的斗争坚持到底；特别应当警惕的是可能发生的早霜冻害。
    据中央气象局预测，今年的早霜可能比往年早来十天到半月左右。而今年因为夏季雨水多，气温低，日照少，许多地区的作物生长得比较慢，成熟期可能延迟；受涝地区排水以后补种的作物，收获的时期更要迟。这两种因素凑在一起，就很可能使有一些作物遭受霜害。为了有效地预防霜害，保证完成增产任务，必须注意作好以下工作：
    第一、要加强天气预报和警报工作。这是和霜害作斗争的一个重要的环节，正如作战必须准确及时地了解敌情一样。各地气象台和农业部门，应当按照中央人民政府政务院“关于加强灾害性天气的预报、警报和预防工作的指示”，密切联系、互相配合，把这个工作做好。各地广播电台、报纸和电信局，应当给予这个工作以很好的协助。
    第二、要及早总结各地群众过去的防霜经验，传播好的防霜办法。气象工作者和农业科学工作者要密切合作，运用科学原理对群众的经验加以切实的总结，使正确的方法能够改进和传播，使不正确的作法能够纠正。各地地形地势不同，作物不同，能够应用的防霜物资不同，应当根据各地不同的需要推行最有效最便利的方法。
    第三、要适当地选择防霜的重点，而且要尽可能地事先从田间管理着手进行间接的预防。因为严霜一发生，就要散布在比较广大的地区；如不早作准备，临时才普遍地在每一块地上进行防灾工作，就人力和物力来说，都是不能胜任的。因此，要选择最易遭受冻害的作物和容易遭受冻害的地段有重点地进行预防。目前，对棉花应该进一步加强整枝去叶、深锄等田间管理工作，促使早熟；对二茬菸要及早打去旁杈，留叶片不要过多，要避免追肥过晚延迟成熟；对甘薯要加强培土工作，盖好垅上缝隙；对荞麦等晚秋作物也要加强田间管理，注意适时收获。
    在进行这些工作时，都要对群众进行增产的政治思想动员，并且把防霜的道理和技术加以通俗的说明，防止发生任何形式的强迫命令现象。国营农场和农业生产合作社要带头做好防霜工作，带动互助组和广大群众，协同一致，争取增产保收斗争的最后胜利。
