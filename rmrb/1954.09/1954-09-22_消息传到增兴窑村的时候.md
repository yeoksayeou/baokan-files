    When the news of the state's implementation of planned purchase and planned supply of cotton cloth reached Zengxingyao Village in the eastern suburbs of Tianjin, Wang Ergiao, the wife of Wang Degui, a member of the Jinshien Horticulture Production Cooperative, and Wang Daniu, Wang Degui's sister-in-law, discussed it enthusiastically. They both said: Judging from the clothing and cloth use in our own family and our village in the past few years, it makes sense to implement planned cotton cloth supply.
    Before liberation, Wang Degui and his four brothers had only a little over two mu of garden land, which was not enough to make a living, so they had to fend for themselves. Wang Degui helped people grow vegetables and deliver vegetables in the village, earning a little money each day, not even enough to eat, let alone wear. Before liberation, they had two children, a family of four, relying on only one old quilt to get through the winter. At night, the adults were so cold they couldn't sleep, and the children cried from the cold. The mother didn't know how many tears she shed! Wang Degui's padded jacket and trousers, although patched countless times, and the cotton was who-knows-how-old, were still a remarkable piece of property: keeping him warm in winter, pulling out the cotton in spring to make a lined jacket, and in the heat of summer, taking apart the lining to wear as a single layer.
    Only after Tianjin was liberated did Wang Degui and his family's hard days come to an end. The government distributed more than four mu of garden land to him. Last year, he also joined the Horticulture Production Cooperative, and his life gradually became prosperous. He had no worries about food, built a new house, and successively added four brand-new quilts to his home, "new lining, new cover, and new cotton," and also made new mattresses. Not only did everyone in the family have new cotton clothes, but they also had single and lined clothes. The biggest change was in the children. An eleven-year-old girl was already in elementary school and got new clothes almost every year. The younger siblings each had two or three sets of single clothes alone!
    Both of these peasant women spoke with great joy and gratitude about this important measure of the state. They said: Of course, the state is producing more and more cloth every year, but there are who-knows-how-many families and villages like ours in the country. If everyone uses more, naturally things will seem insufficient. Moreover, we still have to build a socialist society, and our country naturally can't just weave cloth, so planned supply is the right thing to do. They also believed that the state was going to carry out large-scale construction, and they should also think of ways to save more cloth.

### 消息传到增兴窑村的时候

    消息传到增兴窑村的时候
    国家实行棉布计划收购和计划供应的消息传到天津市东郊区增兴窑村的时候，金世恩园田生产合作社社员王德贵的妻子王二嫂和王德贵的大嫂王大娘热烈地谈论起来。她俩都说：拿我们自己家和我们村里这几年穿衣用布的情况看起来，实行棉布计划供应是有道理的。
    解放前，王德贵弟兄五个人只有二亩多园田，维持不了生活，只好各自为生活奔波。王德贵在村里帮人家种菜、送菜，一天挣点钱，饭也吃不饱，更谈不上穿了。解放前他们有两个孩子，一家四口，就靠了一床旧被子过冬。晚上，大人冷得睡不着觉，孩子冻得直哭，作妈妈的也不知流过多少眼泪！王德贵身上的一身棉袄、棉裤，虽然不知道补了多少回，棉花也不知道有多旧，可是究竟是一件很了不起的财产：冬天御寒，春天抽出棉花来作夹衣，到了热天，拆了里子又当单衣。
    天津解放了，王德贵和他一家的苦日子才算熬出了头。政府分给了他四亩多园田，去年他又参加了园田生产合作社，生活逐渐富裕起来，吃的不愁了，还盖了新房子，家里陆续添了四床“里新、外新、棉花新”的大被子，同时还做了大褥子。全家的人，不仅都做了新棉衣，单衣、夹衣也全有。变化最大的是孩子们，一个十一岁的姑娘已经在小学上学，几乎每年都做一身新衣服。弟弟妹妹光是单衣，每人也都有两三身！
    这两个农妇都以极大的喜悦和感激的心情谈论着国家这项重要的措施。她们说：本来么，国家生产的布一年比一年多，可是像我们这样的家庭、这样的村庄，在全国也不知道有多少，大家都用得多了，东西自然会显得不够。而且，我们还要建设社会主义社会，我们国家就自然不能净织布，所以计划供应作得对。她们还认为，国家要进行大规模的建设，自己还要想法子多节约些布才对。
