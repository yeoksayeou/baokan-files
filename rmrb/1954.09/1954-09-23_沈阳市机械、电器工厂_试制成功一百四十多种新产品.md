Shenyang's mechanical and electrical factories have successfully trial-produced over 140 new products this year, as part of a significant increase in new products based on the principle of "production determined by sales." These new products are all trial-produced according to the needs of various units, and the vast majority are designed according to Soviet standards.

Of the 46 new products that the Shenyang Water Pump Factory planned to trial-produce this year, 27 have already been successfully trial-produced. The Soviet-style deep-well pump they made for the Shenyang Wire Factory can draw naturally filtered clean water from 140 meters underground to the surface, meeting special industrial needs. Among the 33 new products successfully trial-produced by the Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory is a new type of Soviet-style conveyor for the Fushun Coal Mine, which can transport coal or ore 100 meters in just 30 seconds, transporting over 100 tons of coal per hour, roughly equivalent to the physical labor of more than 260 workers in an hour. The reversible crusher trial-produced by Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory for Anshan Iron and Steel Company has also been successful. It can crush coal, as well as various brittle ores such as oil shale and gypsum. The production volume in one day and night is enough to fill 160 train cars. Other products, such as the cement reactors trial-produced by the Shenyang Transformer Factory for Anshan Iron and Steel and Benxi Iron and Steel, and the low-voltage switches for electric mud guns trial-produced by the Shenyang Low-Voltage Switch Factory for Anshan Iron and Steel, are all designed according to Soviet standards, and the quality of the products meets the standards.

In order to trial-produce new products in a timely manner and supply them to the units in need, the factories have taken some measures to shorten the trial production time. Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory adopted the parallel and cross-operation method for production preparation, which generally shortened the production preparation period by seven to ten days. The production of short-tube ball mills originally required 26 days, but after adopting the parallel and cross-operation method for production preparation, the task was completed in only ten days. Shenyang Fan Factory used representative products for sample trial production, so that the same type of products with different sizes and specifications did not need to be trial-produced one by one, greatly shortening the trial production time. In order to ensure that the quality of new products meets the standards, the factory workers also actively tried to overcome the difficulties in production technology. When making cement pillars for cement reactors, the workers of Shenyang Transformer Factory used the method of soaking the cement after pouring it, which not only guaranteed the product quality, but also shortened the drying time of the cement pillars by 18 days compared to natural drying (natural drying takes 28 days, now it only takes 10 days). In addition to learning the parallel and cross-operation method of Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory, Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory also consulted with the ordering units to ensure that the product quality meets the requirements of the ordering units.

    沈阳市机械、电器工厂
    试制成功一百四十多种新产品
    沈阳市的机械、电器工厂今年按照“以销定产”方针增加的大量新产品中，已陆续试制成功一百四十多种。这些新产品都是根据各单位的需要进行试制的，绝大部分是按照苏联标准设计的。
    沈阳水泵厂在今年计划试制的四十六种新产品中，已有二十七种试制成功。他们为沈阳电线厂制出的苏联式的深井抽水机，可以从一百四十公尺深的地下把经过天然滤过的清水抽到地面上来，供应工业上的特殊需要。沈阳矿山机器厂试制成功的三十三种新产品中，有供抚顺煤矿用的一种苏联式新型运输机，只要三十秒钟就可以把煤或矿石输送一百公尺远，每小时能输送一百多吨煤，约等于二百六十多个工人一小时体力劳动的结果。沈阳重型机器厂为鞍山钢铁公司试制的可逆式破碎机也成功了。它可以破碎煤，还能破碎各种脆质矿石如油母页岩、石膏等，一天一宿的生产量，就够装一百六十个火车皮。其他如沈阳变压器厂为鞍钢和本溪钢铁公司试制成功的水泥电抗器，沈阳低压开关厂为鞍钢试制成功的电动泥泡上的低压开关等，也都是按照苏联标准设计的，产品的质量都合乎标准。
    各工厂为了能及时地把新产品试制出来供给需要单位，都采取了一些措施来缩短试制时间。沈阳重型机器厂采取了平行交叉作业法进行生产准备，使生产准备期一般缩短七天到十天。他们生产短筒球磨机原需要二十六天，采用平行交叉作业法进行生产准备后，只十天就完成了任务。沈阳扇风机厂用代表型产品进行样品试制，使大小规格不同的同一类型产品不必再一一试制，使试制时间大大地缩短了。为了保证新产品的质量合乎标准，各工厂的职工还积极想办法来克服生产技术上的困难。沈阳变压器厂职工做水泥电抗器的水泥柱子时，使用浇灌水泥后浸水的办法，不但保证了产品质量，而且使水泥柱子的干燥时间比原来自然干燥缩短了十八天（自然干燥要二十八天，现在只要十天）。沈阳第三机床厂除了学习沈阳重型机器厂的平行交叉作业法外，还和订货单位共同协商，来保证产品质量达到订货单位的要求。（新华社）
