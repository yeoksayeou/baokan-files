Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 4th: The British Admiralty issued a statement in London on August 25th, which contained unfounded materials about the Soviet Navy. The statement is full of speculations about the Soviet Union's plans for establishing naval forces, the strength of the navy, and so on.

This statement by the British official organ aroused the clamor of the British newspapers. "Daily Mail," "Daily Express," "News Chronicle," and other British newspapers and British radio stations, as if under orders, launched a propaganda campaign around this statement, continuously creating a lot of rumors.

All this clearly shows that the British Admiralty's statement and the subsequent press propaganda campaign were launched by those who attempted to support the discredited "policy of strength" and advocated the continuation of the arms expansion movement.

Just as the Soviet Union is making every effort to ease international tensions and promote international cooperation, those who advocate the "policy of strength" are trying to worsen the situation and make it difficult to reach agreements on unresolved international issues.

It is worth noting that the above-mentioned propaganda campaign coincided with calls for increased funding for the British Navy, and some newspapers even threatened British taxpayers with the "threat" of the Soviet Navy to Britain. A Swedish newspaper rightly said that the British Admiralty seemed to "need a favorable wind" to help it implement its own naval construction plans.

At the same time, it is not difficult to see that this is done to divert people's attention from the just calls of people all over the world who are increasingly determined to ban atomic and hydrogen weapons, reduce national armaments, and eliminate the threat of new wars.

TASS is authorized to declare: The British Admiralty's statement about the strength of the Soviet Navy and its alleged intentions is completely fabricated.

    塔斯社受权发表声明驳斥英海军部的谰言
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科四日电：英国海军部八月二十五日在伦敦发表一篇声明，其中包含毫无根据的关于苏联海军的材料。声明里满篇都是对苏联建立海军部队的计划、海军的力量等等的臆测。
    英国官方机关的这篇声明引起了英国报纸的叫嚷。“每日邮报”、“每日快报”、“新闻纪事报”和其他一些英国报纸以及英国电台就好像奉到命令一样，环绕着这篇声明发动了一个宣传运动，连续制造了一大堆谣言。
    这一切清楚说明，英国海军部的声明和随后出现的报界宣传运动都是那些企图支持那种信誉扫地的“实力政策”和主张继续进行扩军运动的人所发动的。
    正当苏联在尽一切力量缓和国际紧张局势和促进国际合作的时候，那些鼓吹“实力政策”的人却在竭力使局势恶化，并且使得难于就没有解决的国际问题达成协议。
    值得注意的是：上述宣传运动是和要求增加给英国海军的拨款的言论同时出现的，而且有些报纸还以苏联海军对英国的“威胁”来恫吓英国纳税人。一家瑞典报纸说得好，英国海军部似乎“需要一阵顺风”，来帮助它执行它自己的海军建设计划。
    同时也不难看出，这样做是为了转移人们对全世界人民日益坚决要求禁止原子武器和氢武器，裁减各国军备和消除新战争威胁的正义呼声的注意力。
    塔斯社受权声明：英国海军部关于苏联海军的实力以及据说是他们所怀有的意图的声明，是完全凭空捏造的。
