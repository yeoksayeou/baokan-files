(Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, September 17th) TASS Vienna, September 16th: The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council held a meeting in Vienna from September 13th to 15th. The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council issued the following statement:

Tremendous events have brought new hope to the world, inspiring the efforts of all those struggling for peace.

The Korean and Indochinese armistice agreements have been signed; the "European Army" treaty, which would have permitted the revival of German militarism, has been rejected by the French Parliament.

The measures taken by the World Peace Council and the peace movement it initiated have mobilized the people of all countries and organized their forces. Today, hundreds of millions of people in all countries have the right to be proud of the role they have played in this great victory.

However, there is another danger present, and peace forces must remain constantly vigilant against it. Europe faces a direct threat that could nullify all the achievements made. Rebuilding the German army and drawing it into military blocs remains the goal pursued by certain national governments. This would trap Germany in permanent division, deepen the artificial rift between the two parts of Europe, and lead to intensified arms expansion.

The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council calls on the people of all countries to prevent the rearmament of Germany in any form under any pretext. The Standing Committee calls on the people of all countries to demand that the governments of the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France immediately resume negotiations.

No national government should take actions that would hinder negotiations or impose preconditions to obstruct negotiations.

A peaceful resolution of the German question should be acceptable to every concerned country and the German people themselves. This solution will end the division of Germany, prevent Germany from being used as a tool to threaten any of its neighbors, and provide the possibility of organizing European security.

Security cannot be guaranteed if the world is divided into mutually opposed blocs through the establishment of military alliances. To ensure security, peaceful coexistence among countries with different political and social systems is essential, as is cooperation among all countries and the conclusion of agreements on universal disarmament and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction.

In order to unite all peace forces to strive for the realization of these great tasks, the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council has decided to convene a meeting of the World Peace Council on November 18, 1954. The Standing Committee recommends that the following issues be included in the agenda of the meeting and discussed:

	I. Cooperation among all European countries in organizing their common security;
	II. The situation in various parts of Asia due to foreign pressure and the establishment of various blocs and military alliance systems;
	III. The situation in Latin America due to foreign interference in the internal affairs of Latin American countries;
	IV. The struggle of peace forces for the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction;
	V. Preparations for convening a World Congress of Peace Forces in the first half of 1955.

    世界和平理事会常务委员会发表声明
    决定召开世界和平理事会会议
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社维也纳十六日讯：世界和平理事会常务委员会从九月十三日到十五日在维也纳举行会议。世界和平理事会常务委员会发表了下列声明：
    巨大的事件替世界带来了新的希望，鼓舞了一切为和平而斗争的人们的努力。
    朝鲜和印度支那停战协定签订了；准许德国军国主义复活的“欧洲军”条约被法国议会拒绝了。
    世界和平理事会所采取的措施和它所发起的保卫和平的运动发动了各国人民，并组织了他们的力量。今天，各国千千万万的人民有权为他们在这个伟大的胜利中所起的作用感到骄傲。
    但是，目前存在着另外一种危险，和平力量必须对它保持经常的警惕。欧洲面临着会使一切已获得的成就化为乌有的直接威胁。重建德国军队，将它拉入军事集团，仍然是某些国家政府所追求的目的。这会使德国永远陷于分裂，会使人为的欧洲两部分之间的裂痕加深，并会引起扩充军备的加强。
    世界和平理事会常务委员会号召各国人民阻止在任何借口下以任何形式重新武装德国。常务委员会号召各国人民要求美国、苏联、英国和法国的政府立即恢复谈判。
    任何一国政府都不应当采取会妨碍谈判进行的行动或提出先决条件来阻挠谈判。
    德国问题的和平解决是应当为每一个有关国家和德国人民自己所接受的。这种解决将结束德国的分裂，不让德国作为威胁它的任何邻国的工具，同时替组织欧洲安全提供可能。
    如果用建立军事同盟的方法将世界分成为互相对立的集团，安全是不能获得保证的。要保障安全，必须不分政治制度和社会制度的各国和平共处，一切国家进行合作，缔结普遍裁军和禁止大规模毁灭性武器的协定。
    为了联合一切和平力量来争取实现这些伟大的任务，世界和平理事会常务委员会决定在一九五四年十一月十八日召开世界和平理事会会议。常务委员会建议将下列问题列入会议议程并加以讨论：
    一、一切欧洲国家在组织它们的共同安全中的合作；
      二、由于外国压力和各种集团与军事同盟体系的建立而在亚洲各地所形成的局势；
    三、由于外国对拉丁美洲国家内部事务进行干涉而在拉丁美洲所形成的局势；
    四、和平力量为裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭性武器的斗争；
    五、筹备在一九五五年上半年召开世界和平力量代表大会。
