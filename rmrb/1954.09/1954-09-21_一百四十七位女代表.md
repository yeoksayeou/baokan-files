Editor's Note: The founding of the People's Republic of China has opened up broad avenues for the complete emancipation of women nationwide. Over the past five years, the state has promulgated many important laws and decrees to ensure women's equal rights with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, social, and family life. The great historical facts have inspired the women of the whole country to love the motherland and build socialism with enthusiasm. At present, whether in factories, mines, cities, or rural areas, women have become an important force in construction; they are now striving with confidence to build a socialist society and to strive for a happier life for themselves.

    One Hundred and Forty-Seven Female Representatives
    New China Women's Agency
    The First Session of the First National People's Congress, which is of great historical significance, has solemnly opened. The 1,226 representatives of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, entrusted by 600 million people, have come to the capital, Beijing, from factories, rural areas, border regions, and overseas, from all parts of the motherland, to jointly discuss and decide on major issues related to the country's socialist construction and the happy life of the people of the whole country. Among these glorious people's representatives, there are one hundred and forty-seven female representatives. Some of them are government workers – Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government, ministers of the Central People's Government, presidents of local people's courts, female county heads, etc.; some are members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and various democratic parties, as well as party affairs workers in local organizations; some are labor models, production innovators, and production leaders with outstanding achievements on the industrial and agricultural production fronts; some have served in cultural and educational positions for many years – famous female writers, female artists, female actresses, female musicians, as well as scientific workers, university professors, model teachers, and leaders in education, journalists; there are also women workers, child care workers, trade union workers, and accounting workers who serve women and children; there are also outstanding figures from the military, families of revolutionary martyrs, and families of workers and staff; there are also representative figures from the industrial and commercial sectors and religious circles. They include outstanding and representative figures from all classes, all nationalities, all parties, all social occupations, overseas Chinese, and housewives. Like the male representatives, they represent the will of the people of the whole country and exercise the highest power of the state. This great fact once again proves that our country grants women equal political rights with men; once again it shows that our country has not only legally but also in actual life realized the principle of equality between men and women. The era of despising and enslaving women in the old society, when women had no status in politics, economy, culture, and other aspects, is gone forever.

    Among the female representatives are Hu Wenxiu, the mother of the martyr Liu Hulan, who "lived greatly and died gloriously," Deng Fangzhi, the mother of Huang Jiguang, the martyr hero of the Chinese People's Volunteers in the style of Matrosov, and Rong Guanxiu, who was known as the "Mother of the Soldiers" in the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the War of Liberation.... It was they and other millions of mothers who, with their great hearts, raised and dedicated their heroic children, and shed their blood for the cause of the Chinese people's revolution; it was they and other millions of wives and mothers who encouraged their relatives or encouraged and helped the revolutionary soldiers like relatives, defeated the Kuomintang bandits and American imperialism, and defended the safety of the people and the integrity of the territory of the motherland. They have contributed to the cause of the Chinese people's revolution and are universally respected by the people.

    Many of the female representatives are new people who have emerged since the founding of New China. Although most of them are still young, they have already made considerable contributions to the country. Some of the industrial labor models among them were only thirteen or fourteen years old when New China was founded. The old society forced them to enter factories at a very young age, suffering cruel exploitation and oppression. After liberation, under the kind care and education of the Party and the People's Government, they quickly grew up, continuously labored with enthusiasm in the attitude of masters of the country, and made creations and innovations in production. Here are Hao Jianxiu, the creator of the nationally renowned fine yarn working method, Guo Xiuyun, who created advanced operating methods in long-distance telephone work, Li Fenglan, who summed up the "Five Clean Operation Method" with the help of the Party and the trade union, Chen Shulan, who created a new national record for doffing, Wei Xiuying, one of the creators of the "1951 Weaving Method," and Hang Peilan, Yi Shijuan, Zhang Xinghua, Liu Shimei, Zhu Jiu, Zhu Zaodi, Li Guiying, Wang Meigong and other female workers who continuously increased production and innovated technology. The main reason why they were able to make achievements in production is because they recognized the status of the working class in the country, recognized that working for the country is working for themselves, and thus fully exerted their labor enthusiasm, carried out creative labor in building the socialist motherland, and at the same time they have the excellent qualities of the working class, being selfless and caring for others more than themselves. Many of them not only produce well themselves, but also lead the entire group to do a good job in production, not only the whole group produces well, but also pass on the experience to the whole factory, affecting the whole country. They care about the masses and humbly learn from the masses, so they are supported by the masses.

    Most of the agricultural labor models and leaders of agricultural production cooperatives among the female representatives are also new people who have grown up since the founding of New China. Five years ago, they were just ordinary rural women; after liberation, under the education and help of the Party, they became the leaders of socialism in the countryside. Here we can see Li Youxiu, the president of the Wuliting Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xingguo County, Jiangxi Province, Kang Juying, the president of the Hengyue Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hengshan County, Hunan Province, Li Tianying, the director of the Sanliushu Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Guangrao County, Shandong Province, Jin Xingshu (Korean nationality), the president of the Xiaoying Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yanbian Autonomous Prefecture, Jilin Province, Sun Xiangyun, the president of the Yanglou Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fengqiu County, Henan Province, and Shen Jilan, the vice president of the Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Shanxi Province. Although they come from different regions, they have a common belief: firmly believe that organizing is the way to change from poverty to wealth; agricultural socialist transformation must be carried out in the countryside to build a beautiful life like that in the Soviet countryside. In order to achieve this beautiful goal, they relied on the masses, relied on the Party and the government, mobilized farmers household by household, took the lead in organizing agricultural production cooperatives, learned advanced production experience, improved farming techniques, continuously increased production, and supported national industrial construction. They have not been without difficulties in their work, but under the education of the Party, they can overcome difficulties and continue to move forward. Shen Jilan said: "The Party's support and encouragement have increased my infinite strength." Because they all have advanced ideas and a tenacious spirit to overcome difficulties, they are loved by the peasants.

    Among the female representatives, we can see many cultural and educational, scientific, artistic and medical workers. They also had their own ideals in the old society, hoping to contribute what they had learned to society and do something for the country and the people; but under the dark rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, their good wishes were only destroyed and suppressed, and they never had the opportunity to be realized. The female people's representative from the Ili River in Xinjiang, the model teacher Mirnisha Khan Aini, who is loved and respected by the Uygur people, was arrested, interrogated, and tortured twice by the Kuomintang reactionary government in the old society just to realize the wish of teaching children well and helping poor children solve the problem of studying under difficult conditions. Lu Shijia, a scientific worker who is now a professor at Beijing Aviation College, went to Germany with full enthusiasm for saving the country at the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression to study fluid dynamics related to aircraft design, but after returning, the Kuomintang reactionaries launched a civil war and there was no talk of construction at all, so she had to teach. But today is different, the people give scientists, artists, cultural and educational workers all the conditions to facilitate work, the state rewards and supports them to carry out creative labor, so that they realize their beautiful wishes, and at the same time they get the highest honor and status given by the people, and are elected as representatives of the National People's Congress. Among the representatives is also Gao Fengqin, a family member of workers and staff from Shenyang. She and her mutual aid group encouraged the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers and staff in production by doing housework well and taking good care of the workers and staff's diet and rest. In our country, they can make contributions to the people in any position.

    Among the representatives are also many women workers who serve the masses of women wholeheartedly, and child care workers who cultivate young children in accordance with socialist principles. In order to completely free the broad masses of women from the shackles imposed on women by the old Chinese social system and ideology, they have actively encouraged and widely organized women to participate in labor production, helped women to relieve the suffering they have suffered in marriage issues, and helped women solve other difficulties. In order to make children live happily and grow up healthily in body and mind, child care workers have undertaken ordinary but great work tirelessly; their hard work has enabled countless mothers to participate in work with peace of mind and better.

    Although New China has only been born for a short five years, it has enabled women to obtain equal rights with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, social, and family life. In our country, the growth of women has been constantly cared for, educated, and cultivated by the Communist Party of China and the People's Government, and has been warmly and patiently helped, supported, and encouraged by trade unions, women's federations, and the Youth League. At the same time, with the continuous efforts of women themselves, the women of New China, like spring bamboo shoots after the rain, are growing rapidly and healthily. The fact that many female people's representatives have grown up shows that women can only develop rapidly into useful talents in today's era when the people are the masters of the country.

    As a woman of New China, being entrusted by 600 million people to represent the will of 600 million people and exercise the highest power of the state is a very glorious and important task. We believe that the female representatives will certainly be able to rely on the people, maintain close contact with the masses, listen to the opinions of the masses, accept the supervision of the masses, and do the work of the people's representatives with humility and caution, and strive to build a prosperous and happy socialist society.

    编者按：中华人民共和国的成立，给全国妇女的彻底解放开辟了广阔的道路。五年来，国家颁布了不少重要的法律和命令，保障了妇女在政治、经济、文化、社会和家庭生活等各方面和男子平等的权利。伟大的历史事实激发了全国妇女热爱祖国和建设社会主义的热情。目前，不论在工厂、矿山、城市或农村，妇女都已经成为重要的建设力量；她们现在正满怀信心地为建成社会主义社会和争取自己更幸福的生活而奋斗。
    一百四十七位女代表
    新中国妇女社
    具有伟大历史意义的第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，已经隆重地开幕了。受六万万人民重托的中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会的
  一千二百二十六名代表，从工厂、农村、边疆和海外，从祖国的各个地方来到了首都北京，共同商讨和决定关系着国家社会主义建设，关系全国人民幸福生活的大事。在这些光荣的人民代表中，有一百四十七位女代表。她们有的是政府工作者——中央人民政府副主席、中央人民政府的部长、地方人民法院院长、女县长等；有的是中国共产党和各民主党派中央委员会的委员以及地方组织的党务工作者；有的是工农业生产战线上有卓越成绩的劳动模范、生产革新者和生产领导者；有的是多年在文化教育岗位上服务的——著名的女作家、女艺术家、女演员、女音乐家，有科学工作者、大学教授、模范教师以及教育工作的领导者、新闻工作者；还有为妇女儿童服务的妇女工作者、保育工作者以及工会工作者和会计工作者；还有部队、烈军属和工属中优秀的人物；还有工商界、宗教界代表性的人物。她们包括了各个阶层、各个民族、各个党派、各个社会职业、华侨以及家庭妇女中的优秀人物和代表性的人物。她们和男代表一样，代表全国人民的意志，行使着国家的最高权力。这一伟大的事实，再一次证明了我们国家赋予妇女同男子平等的政治权利；再一次说明了我们国家不仅在法律上而且在实际生活中实现了男女平等的原则。旧社会里轻视、奴役妇女，妇女在政治、经济、文化等各方面毫无地位的时代，一去不复返了。
    女代表中，有“生的伟大，死的光荣”的刘胡兰烈士的母亲胡文秀，有中国人民志愿军马特洛索夫式英雄黄继光烈士的母亲邓芳芝，有在抗日战争和解放战争中被称为“子弟兵的母亲”的戎冠秀……。是她们和其他千千万万的母亲们，以她们伟大的胸怀，养育了并献出了自己的英雄儿女，为中国人民的革命事业流尽了鲜血；是她们和其他千千万万的妻子们和母亲们，鼓舞着自己的亲人或像亲人一样鼓舞帮助着革命战士，战胜了国民党匪帮和美帝国主义，保卫了祖国人民的安全和领土主权的完整。她们为中国人民的革命事业作出了贡献，她们受到人民的普遍尊敬。
    女代表中，有很多是新中国成立以后涌现的新人。她们虽然大都年纪还轻，可是对国家已经有了不少贡献。她们中的工业劳动模范，有的在新中国成立时还不过十三、四岁，旧社会逼使她们很小年纪就进了工厂，受着残酷的剥削和压迫。解放后，在党和人民政府的亲切关怀和教育下，她们很快地成长起来，不断地以国家主人翁的态度热情地劳动并在生产上有了创造和革新。这里有全国闻名的细纱工作法创造者郝建秀、有在长途电话话务工作中创造了先进操作法的郭秀云、有在党和工会帮助下总结出“五洁操作法”的李凤兰、有创造了全国落纱新纪录的陈树兰、有“一九五一织布工作法”创造人之一的魏秀英、有不断提高生产量和革新技术的杭佩兰、裔式娟、张杏花、刘世梅、朱玖、朱早弟、李桂英、王美恭等女工。她们所以能够在生产上做出成绩，主要是因为她们认识了工人阶级在国家的地位，认识了为国家进行劳动就是为自己进行劳动，因而充分发挥了劳动积极性，在建设社会主义的祖国中进行了创造性的劳动，同时她们具有工人阶级的优秀品质，大公无私，关心别人甚于自己。她们很多不仅自己生产好，而且带动全组把生产搞好，不仅全组生产好，而且把经验传授给全厂，影响全国。她们关心群众，并虚心地向群众学习，因此获得群众拥护。
    女代表中，农业劳动模范和农业生产合作社的领导者大多数也是在新中国成立以后成长的新人。她们在五年以前还是普普通通的农村妇女；解放后，在党的教育和帮助下，成为农村中社会主义的带头人。这里我们可以看到江西省兴国县五里亭村农业生产合作社社长李友秀、湖南省衡山县横岳乡农业生产合作社社长康菊英、山东省广饶县三柳树村农业生产合作社主任李田英、吉林省延边自治区小营农业生产合作社社长金信淑（朝鲜族）、河南省封邱县杨楼村农业生产合作社社长孙香云、山西省李顺达农林牧生产合作社副社长申纪兰，她们虽然来自不同的地区，然而她们具有共同的信念：坚信组织起来是由穷变富的道路；在农村必须进行农业社会主义改造，建设像苏联农村那样美好的生活。为了实现这个美好的目的，她们依靠群众，依靠党和政府，把一户一户的农民动员起来，带头组织农业生产合作社，学习先进生产经验，改进耕作技术，不断地提高生产量，支持国家工业建设。她们在工作中不是没有困难的，但在党的教育下她们能够克服困难，继续前进。申纪兰说：“党的支持和鼓励，增加了我无限的力量。”因为她们都具有先进的思想和克服困难的顽强精神，因而得到农民的爱戴。
    在女代表中，我们可以看到有很多文化教育、科学、艺术和医务工作者。她们在旧社会也有过自己的理想，希望把自己所学的贡献给社会，为国家为人民做一点事情；但在国民党反动派的黑暗统治下，她们这些善良的愿望只有被摧残被压抑，永远得不到发挥的机会。来自新疆伊犁河畔的女人民代表，维吾尔族人民热爱和敬重的模范教师美尔尼沙汉·艾尼，在旧社会只是为了实现教好孩子的愿望，在困难的条件下帮助穷苦的孩子解决读书的问题，就遭到了国民党反动政府两次的逮捕、审讯和拷打。现任北京航空学院教授的科学工作者陆士嘉，抗日战争开始时，她怀着满腔的救国热情到德国去学习和飞机设计有关的流体动力学，但是回来后，国民党反动派发动内战根本谈不到建设，只好去教书。但是今天不同了，人民给予科学家、艺术家、文化教育工作者一切便利工作的条件，国家奖励和支持她们进行创造性的劳动，使她们实现了自己美好的愿望，同时也得到人民所给予的最高荣誉和地位，被选为全国人民代表大会的代表。代表中也有来自沈阳的职工家属高凤琴。她和她的互助组曾以做好家务、周到地照顾职工们的饮食、休息，鼓舞了职工们在生产中的积极性和创造性。在我们国家，她们在任何岗位上都可以作出对人民有利的贡献。
    代表中还有许多全心全意为妇女群众服务的妇女工作者，和按照社会主义的原则培育幼儿的保育工作者。她们为了使广大妇女完全解脱旧中国在社会制度上和思想意识上加于妇女的束缚，曾积极鼓励和广泛组织妇女参加了劳动生产，帮助妇女解除在婚姻问题上所遭受的痛苦，并帮助妇女解决其他方面的困难。为了使孩子们生活得幸福，使孩子们身心健康地成长起来，保育工作者不辞劳苦地担负了平凡而伟大的工作；她们的辛勤努力，曾使得无数的母亲们能够安心地和更好地参加工作。
    新中国诞生虽只不过短短五年，但已使妇女在政治、经济、文化、社会和家庭生活各个方面得到了和男子平等的权利。在我国，妇女的成长，有着中国共产党和人民政府不断的关怀、教育和培养，有着工会、妇联、青年团亲切而耐心的帮助、支持和鼓舞，同时加上妇女本身不断的努力，因而，新中国的妇女，像雨后的春笋一样，迅速而健壮地成长起来。许多女人民代表生长的事实，说明妇女只有在人民当家作主的今天，才能迅速发展成为有用的人才。
    作为一个新中国的妇女，能够受六万万人民的重托，代表六万万人民的意志，行使国家最高权力，这是一个十分光荣而重大的任务。我们相信女代表们一定能够依靠人民群众，经常保持同群众的密切联系，倾听群众的意见，接受群众的监督，虚心谨慎地做好人民代表的工作，为建设繁荣幸福的社会主义社会而奋斗。
