Tonight, from the wonderful performance of the Bulgarian People's Army Song and Dance Ensemble, which was awarded the Bulgarian People's Republic Second Class 'September 9th' Medal, we heard the joyful sounds of the Bulgarian people's peaceful labor, and their firm footsteps toward socialist victory and the cause of defending world peace; at the same time, we also saw the brilliant achievements of Bulgarian music and dance, rich in national characteristics, in praising labor and peace."
