An Unforgettable Day
By our reporter Bai Yuan

A solemn and happy moment long awaited by the Chinese people has arrived. September 20th marked the fifth day of the First Session of the National People's Congress. The afternoon sun scattered the shadows of green leaves across the tree-lined boulevards of Beijing. A continuous stream of cars drove from East and West Chang'an Avenue into Zhongnanhai, all the way to the entrance of Huairen Hall. That magnificent people's palace, adorned with gold and jade, was nestled in the shade of green leaves, welcoming the people's representatives who hold the highest national power.

At three o'clock in the afternoon, the representatives entered the meeting hall with boundless excitement. Chairman Mao sat with the representatives in the delegate seats. Comrade Zhou Enlai presided over today's meeting on the rostrum. After reading the draft of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China word by word, the 1,197 delegates present today unanimously adopted the Constitution of the People's Republic of China with 1,197 votes. This is an unforgettable day. In the future, no matter how many eras pass, our descendants will recall this day, just as we recall those unforgettable days of the past on this day.

In those unforgettable days of the past, we first think of China's history and the people's struggle over the past 100 years. For more than 100 years, the Chinese people have suffered humiliation and insults; for more than 100 years, the Chinese people have lived in this world, unable to hold their heads high or breathe freely. Darkness covered the sky, and evil ruled the land. The past history, scene by scene, is reflected in our eyes, many of which we have personally experienced; on the one hand, there is cruel oppression, enslavement and slaughter, and on the other hand, there is heroic and unyielding struggle. Despite the rivers of blood, the mountains and vegetation were chained, and despite the difficult roads, the Chinese people never stopped moving forward. We remember the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom peasant uprising; we remember the Reform Movement of 1898, the Xinhai Revolution, and the May Fourth Movement; we remember the stormy revolution from 1925 to 1927: the May 30th Movement, the Northern Expedition, all the way to the Guangzhou Uprising; we remember Chiang Kai-shek's massacres, but we also remember the Chinese Communist Party's leadership of the people's struggle for more than 30 years.

The days of raging fire lasted until 1949. In a long struggle, the Chinese Communist Party led the people to defeat the attacks of imperialism and its running dogs and established the People's Republic of China. History turned a new page. After only five years, the victorious Chinese people are closely united, creating a great cause in the history of mankind. They built their own grand factories on the ruins looted and ravaged by imperialists and their running dogs for more than 100 years, and refined steel for their happy lives. They moved mountains and transformed rivers, in order to build an earthly paradise without disasters and poverty. Under the direct leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, they created the first socialist type of constitution in the lives of the Chinese people, and wrote such brilliant words in the East, which was once oppressed and enslaved, and in front of all people who are fighting for democracy and freedom: "All power belongs to the people." They used the flowers they planted with their own hands to open up a fragrant avenue to a socialist society on the land that was once full of poverty and disaster.

Open our constitution and people will see that, in the articles stipulating the powers exercised by the National People's Congress, the people hold the highest state power: from amending the constitution and enacting laws to deciding on issues of war and peace. And, finally, it is stipulated that the National People's Congress can exercise any powers that it deems should be exercised by it. That is to say, the power of the people is infinitely great. That's it, 600 million people, plus infinite power. All of this is for nothing else, but for a peaceful and happy life, for the realization of a socialist society. As long as anyone has a beautiful ideal for their own life, who can not be happy and inspired by this, who can not have all the enthusiasm for it? Since the draft constitution was announced to the people of the whole country, it immediately set off a nationwide discussion, which lasted for more than two months. More than 150 million people participated in the discussion, and the people of the whole country put forward a total of more than 1.18 million amendments to the draft constitution. Before the opening of the National People's Congress, the representatives of the people across the country, when discussing the draft constitution in groups, also conducted serious discussions chapter by chapter, article by article, and sentence by sentence. Now, in the meeting hall of the National People's Congress, representatives of every nation, every class, and every stratum have expressed their wishes to support this great constitution. There are workers and farmers, intellectuals, and also capitalists. One by one, they walked from the representative seats to that people's podium. Standing on that podium, they represent the 600 million people of China who have gained democracy and freedom, speaking to the world and speaking for the happy life of the people.

      An ordinary worker, Wang Chonglun, stood on the podium. His language was humble and simple, and his demeanor was not surprising, but you know, there is so much power in him! This is not only his own power, but the power of the entire Chinese working class. He spoke calmly, talking about how the Chinese workers are working to build a happy life, and also talking about his own labor and creation. Just because of a "universal tool holder" he created, production increased six times in the same time. Thanks to the leadership of the Chinese working class, a country like this has emerged in the East of the world: a country where a new life for mankind has been created, and a new type of person has also been created among mankind. He let the whole world know how much power labor and creation can have in human life! The Constitution stipulates the great goal of our country to build a socialist society. With the leadership of the working class, and with thousands of people like Wang Chonglun, no matter how many difficulties there are, they will all be realized.

Han En, a native Chinese farmer, also stood on that people's podium and spoke to the world. He began by talking about his small village in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province—Baotun. He said that the poor stick village is no longer a poor stick village. They have organized an agricultural production cooperative with 107 households. This year they produced 1.2 million catties of grain, plus tens of thousands of eggs, tens of thousands of catties of pork, and tens of thousands of fish. He counted so many, so clearly. We know that our railways are well-developed, and we can take a train from Beijing all the way to Jiaohe County. But who doesn't know? In the past, it was more difficult for a farmer from a poor mountain village in old China to take a train for days and nights to Beijing, stepping into the emperor's palace with a pair of rough feet, and sitting on the emperor's throne than for an old cow to grow wings? Seeing that all the magical things are about to appear in our lives one by one, this is not because a fairy appeared, but because there is a Communist Party. So we know why Han En said again and again, saying that he wanted to support the Communist Party, support the Constitution, and take the socialist road with the working class.

Old Mama Deng Fangzhi also walked to that historical podium. Her son, Huang Jiguang, that brave hero, sacrificed himself on Shangganling during the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. At this historical moment, she did not want to tell people about the pain in her heart. She is not an ordinary mother of a son, but a mother of a hero! She knows why she sacrificed her son in front of the world, and knows what her son sacrificed for. She said: "I must follow the path of my son,..." What a good mother! She knows how the road of life should be taken, and she must take it that way. As long as the ideal is realized, what does death matter! For a great ideal, for a constitution that guarantees a free and happy life, how many brave, kind, and beautiful lives have been sacrificed for more than 100 years!

    But this day has finally arrived. On this day, when Comrade Zhou Enlai announced that the Constitution had been passed unanimously, a huge applause roared from the entire hall. All the representatives in the audience stood up from their seats together, and cheers rang out from the applause,... And outside the Huairen Hall, in Beijing, where dusk had just fallen, the people of the whole city walked out from beside the radios, and tens of thousands of people were also reveling! Laugh to your heart's content, people of all China! At this beautiful moment, laugh to your heart's content, let us dance and sing, sing the truth of mankind, which has been realized in our country! Because the flowers cultivated by the blood of the Chinese people for more than 100 years have bloomed on our land! "Our cause is just. A just cause is unbreakable by any enemy." Let us—the overwhelming victorious people, hold high the banner of democracy and freedom, and move forward with the banner of socialism!

    难忘的一天
    本报记者　白原
    中国人民长久期待的一个庄严的、幸福的时刻来到了。九月二十日，这是全国人民代表大会第一次会议进行的第五天。午后的阳光把绿叶的荫影散布在北京的林荫道上。接连不断的汽车从东、西长安街驶进了中南海，一直驶到怀仁堂的门前。那一座修饰得金碧辉煌的人民的宫殿掩映在绿叶的荫影里，在迎接着那些执掌最高国家权力的人民代表们。
    下午三点钟，代表们带着无限兴奋的心情走进了会场。毛主席和代表们一起坐在代表的席位上。周恩来同志在大会的主席台上主持今天的会议。在逐字逐句地宣读了中华人民共和国宪法草案以后，今天到会的一千一百九十七个代表，以一千一百九十七票全体一致通过了中华人民共和国宪法。这是一个难忘的日子。将来，不管过了多少年代，我们世世代代的人民的子孙都将要回忆起这个日子，就好像我们在这个日子里想起了过去那些难忘的日子一样。
    在过去那些难忘的日子里，我们首先想起的是中国一百多年来的历史和人民的斗争。一百多年来，中国人民受尽了欺侮和凌辱；一百多年来，中国人民生活在这世界上，抬不起头，出不了气。黑暗蔽遮着天空，罪恶统治着大地。过去的历史，一幕幕地映在我们的眼前，有许多都是我们所亲身经历过的；一方面是残酷的压迫、奴役和屠杀，一方面是英勇不屈的斗争。尽管血流成河，山岳和草木都带上了枷锁，尽管道路是这样艰难，中国人民却没有停止过他们前进的脚步。我们记得太平天国农民的起义；我们记得戊戍政变，辛亥革命，五四运动；我们记得一九二五年到一九二七年革命的狂风暴雨：五卅运动，北伐战争，一直到广州起义；我们记得蒋介石的大屠杀，但也记得中国共产党领导人民所进行的三十多年来的斗争。
    烈火沸腾的日子一直到了一九四九年。中国共产党在长久的斗争中领导人民战胜了帝国主义及其走狗的进攻，建立了中华人民共和国。历史翻过了新的一页。仅仅过了五年，获得了胜利的中国人民紧紧地团结在一起，在人类的历史上开创着伟大的事业。他们在一百多年来帝国主义和他们的走狗所洗劫和蹂躏的废墟上建立起自己的宏大的工厂，为自己幸福的生活炼出了钢铁。他们移动山岳，改造河流，为的是建设一个没有灾难、没有贫困的地上的乐园。在毛泽东同志的直接领导之下，他们在中国人民的生活中创立了第一部社会主义类型的宪法，在曾经被压迫、被奴役的东方，在一切为民主自由而斗争的人民面前，写下了这样光辉灿烂的字句：“一切权力属于人民”。他们用自己亲手栽植起来的花朵，在曾经是充满了贫困和灾难的国土上，开辟了一条芬芳馥郁的走向社会主义社会的大道。
    打开我们的宪法，人们就会看到，在全国人民代表大会所行使的职权的条文里规定，人民掌握着最高的国家权力：从修改宪法，制定法律，一直到决定战争和和平的问题。并且，最后还规定着：只要全国人民代表大会认为应当由它行使的职权它都可以行使。这就是说，人民的权力是无限大的。就是这样，六亿的人民，加上无限大的权力。这一切，都不是为了别的，而是为了和平、幸福的生活，为了社会主义社会的实现。只要对自己的生活有着美好的理想的人，谁能不因此而欢欣鼓舞，谁能不对它怀着全部的热情？自从宪法草案向全国人民公布以后，立即就掀起了全民的讨论，一直讨论了两个多月，一亿五千多万人参加了讨论，全国人民对宪法草案一共提出了一百一十八万多条修改的意见。在全国人民代表大会会议开会以前，全国人民的代表在分组讨论宪法草案的时候，他们又逐章、逐条、逐句地进行了认真的讨论。现在，在全国人民代表大会会议的会场上，每一个民族、每一个阶级、每一个阶层的人民代表都为了拥护这个伟大的宪法而表示了他们的心愿。这里有工人和农民，有知识分子，也有资本家。他们一个个地从代表的席位上走上了那一座人民的讲台。他们站在那一座讲台上代表着已经获得了民主自由的中国的六亿人民向世界发言，向人民的幸福的生活发言。
      一个普普通通的工人，王崇伦，站上了讲台，他的语言谦虚而质朴，举止也不惊人，可是你知道，在他的身上有着多么大的力量！这不仅是他一个人的力量，这是整个中国工人阶级的力量。他平平静静地说着，说到中国的工人怎样在为建设幸福的生活而劳动，也说到他自己的劳动和创造，仅仅因为他所创造的一个“万能工具胎”，一下子就使生产在同一个时间内提高了六倍。由于中国工人阶级的领导，在世界的东方出现了这样一个国家：在这个国家里产生了人类的新的生活，也产生了人类中间的新型的人。他让全世界知道，劳动和创造，在人类的生活中能够发生多么大的力量！宪法规定了我们国家建设社会主义社会的伟大目标，有着工人阶级的领导，有着千百个像王崇伦这样的人，不管还有多少艰难也必将全部实现。
    韩恩，这个土生土长的中国农民，也站在那个人民的讲台上，对世界发言。他一开始就说起他那吉林省蛟河县那个小村子—保安屯。他说那个穷棒子村现在已经不是穷棒子村了，他们已经组织了有一百零七户人家的农业生产合作社，今年就打了一百二十万斤粮食，还有多少万个鸡蛋，多少万斤猪肉，多少万条鱼。他数得那么多，数得那么清清楚楚。我们知道，我们的铁路四通八达，从北京坐上火车一直就可以坐到蛟河县。可是谁又不知道？在从前，一个旧中国的农民，从自己的那个穷山村坐上整天整夜的火车要来北京，带着一双粗脚板踏进皇帝的宫殿，而且坐在皇帝的宝座上，这不是比老牛要长翅膀还难？眼看着一切神奇的事情都要一件一件地在我们的生活里出现，这不是因为出了什么神仙，而是因为有了共产党。所以我们知道为什么韩恩一次又一次地说了又说，说要拥护共产党，拥护宪法，要和工人阶级一起走社会主义的道路。
    邓芳芝老妈妈也走到了那一座历史的讲台上，她的儿子黄继光，那一个勇敢的英雄，在抗美援朝的时候在上甘岭牺牲了。在这个历史的时刻，她不是想对人们诉说诉说她心中的苦楚，她不是一个普通的儿子的母亲，而是一个英雄的母亲啊！她懂得为什么在世界的面前献出了自己的儿子，懂得自己的儿子是为了什么牺牲的。她说：“我一定跟着我儿子的路走，……”。这真是一个好妈妈啊！她知道，生活的道路应该怎样走，就一定要怎样走。只要理想实现了，死，又算得什么！为了一个伟大的理想，为了一个保证自由幸福生活的宪法，一百多年来，牺牲了多少勇敢的、善良的、美丽的生命！
    可是，这一天终于来到了，就在今天，当周恩来同志宣布宪法全票通过以后，一片巨大的掌声从整座大厅里轰然响起。全场的代表们一起从他们的座位上站了起来，从一片掌声里响起了欢呼，……。而在怀仁堂的大厅外面，在黄昏刚刚降临的北京，全城的人民从收音机旁走出来，千万的人群也在狂欢！尽情地欢笑吧，全中国的人民！在这一个美好的时刻里尽情地欢笑吧，让我们一边跳舞一边歌唱，歌唱人类的真理，它已经在我们的国家里实现！因为一百多年来中国人民的鲜血所培植的花朵，已经在我们的大地上开放了！“我们的事业是正义的。正义的事业是任何敌人也攻不破的。”让我们——排山倒海的胜利的人民，高举着民主自由的旗帜，高举着社会主义的旗帜前进！
