Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, September 21st: Our correspondent recently interviewed Chairman Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Chairman Ho Chi Minh spoke to the reporter about the tasks of the Vietnamese people in the new situation.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh said: The restoration of peace in Indochina is a major victory for the people of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. This is the result of the national liberation struggle of the Indochinese people against foreign imperialists for the past century, especially the result of the heroic armed struggle of the Vietnamese people under the leadership of the Indochinese Communist Party and the Vietnam Workers' Party for the past eight years. This significant victory shattered the conspiracy of the American imperialists and French colonialists to expand the war and finally conquer the Vietnamese people by force, and at the same time eased world tensions. This significant victory finally ended the rule of the French colonialists in the northern half of Vietnam, enabling the people of the northern half to achieve complete liberation, providing favorable conditions for peaceful construction in the future, and also laying the foundation for further realization of national unification, independence, and democracy.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh said: The Vietnamese people have since entered a new stage. The characteristics of this stage are: the transition from war to peace; from rural to urban areas; from decentralization to centralization; the withdrawal of French troops from the north and their concentration in the south of our country for a certain period. These characteristics of the new stage require us to make major changes in the overall direction, tasks, policies, and even organizational forms and working methods.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh explained these characteristics in detail. He said: In the past, all the struggles and work of the Vietnamese people were carried out in a war environment. Now they must learn to work and fight under peaceful conditions. In the past, due to the war, the liberated areas were mainly in rural areas. Now, not only are we taking over the Red River Delta, but also many newly liberated cities and villages, and we are also entering major cities such as Hanoi and Haiphong. This requires not only managing rural areas, but also managing cities, managing industry, railways, and so on. In the past, due to the war, especially in the context of guerrilla warfare, various regions and departments had to maintain a certain degree of decentralization, which was necessary and correct at the time. But now there are conditions to achieve centralized and unified leadership. The armistice agreement stipulates that the armies of both sides will be temporarily concentrated in the south and north, which requires the two regions to live in peace so that national general elections can be held in the future to achieve unification, complete independence, and democracy.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh pointed out that the Vietnamese people must continue to complete the entire cause of the national democratic movement in the new situation. In the coming period, the general tasks of the Vietnamese people are: First, consolidate peace, prevent and overcome all conspiracies to undermine the armistice agreement; Second, actively complete land reform, restore and increase production, strengthen national defense, and build the north; Third, achieve national unification, independence, and democracy.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh said that the most important task currently being carried out by the Vietnamese people to achieve the overall task is to consolidate the ceasefire and consolidate peace. On the one hand, the Vietnamese people must resolutely implement the armistice agreement, and on the other hand, they must be highly vigilant and crush all conspiracies by American imperialism and a small number of French warmongers to undermine the ceasefire and undermine peace. This is a rather complex, arduous, and long-term struggle.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh said: In order to consolidate the ceasefire and consolidate peace, we still have a lot of work to do. We must take over the newly liberated villages and cities, work hard to heal the wounds of war, restore the national economy, develop foreign trade and urban-rural exchanges, and on this basis, develop production and improve people's lives. We must consolidate the Vietnam Workers' Party, consolidate the democratic regime and the People's Army, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, unite the urban bourgeoisie, intellectuals, and enlightened gentry, correctly implement the religious policy of freedom of religious belief, strengthen the great patriotic unity of the people across the country, and expand and develop the national democratic united front. We must strive to win over and unite all those who are in favor of peace, unification, independence, and democracy, regardless of whether they have cooperated with the other side in the past. We must continue to adjust relations with France through consultation and negotiation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and carry out economic and trade activities, and strengthen the unity and friendship between the peoples of the two countries; establish relations with Cambodia and Laos on the basis of the Five Principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence; strengthen solidarity with Asian countries; firmly stand on the side of the forces of peace and democracy; and unremittingly fight against the American war policy, against the Southeast Asia aggression bloc, and for the realization of Vietnam's unification, independence, and democracy.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh said: The new situation requires us to do a lot of work. We must use one thing to connect all the work together, and that thing is the correct policy. Everything starts from the interests of peace, unification, independence, and democracy, and everything focuses on developing production and prospering the economy; this is the basic starting point of our policy. For example, our basic policy towards newly received cities is to protect and build the cities. Therefore, the primary task after we enter the city is to protect public property from damage, maintain social order and normal life in the city, resume work, resume the market, resume classes, maintain the supply of food and all necessities, maintain the normal operation of public utilities such as water and electricity, post and telecommunications, transportation, and hospitals, retain the original personnel, and pay wages according to the original salary.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh finally said in a very firm tone: Of course, there are many difficulties and obstacles in front of us, but I believe that through the concerted efforts of the entire party, the entire army, and the entire people, a new Vietnam of peace, unification, independence, and democracy will surely be established.

    胡志明主席谈越南新形势的特点
    提出越南人民的三大任务
    【新华社北越二十一日电】本社记者最近访问了越南民主共和国胡志明主席，胡志明主席向记者谈了越南人民在新形势下的任务。
    胡志明主席说：印度支那和平的恢复是越南和老挝、柬埔寨人民的重大胜利。这是印度支那人民过去一世纪来反对外国帝国主义者的民族解放斗争的成果，特别是八年来在印度支那共产党和越南劳动党领导下越南人民进行英勇的武装斗争的结果。这个重大的胜利，粉碎了美帝国主义和法国殖民主义者企图扩大战争、用武力最后征服越南人民的阴谋，同时也缓和了世界紧张局势。这个重大的胜利，最后结束了法国殖民主义者在越南北半部的统治，使北半部人民得到完全的解放，为今后和平建设提供了有利条件，同时也为进一步实现全国的统一、独立和民主奠定了基础。
    胡志明主席说：越南人民从此进入了一个新的阶段。这个阶段的特点是：由战争转入和平；由农村进入城市；由分散转到集中；法国军队撤离北部，在一定时期内集结在我国南部。新阶段的这些特点，要求我们从整个的方针、任务、政策一直到组织形式、工作方法，都要来一个大改变。
    胡志明主席详细说明了这些特点，他说：越南人民过去全部斗争和全部工作都在战争的环境下进行，现在就要学会在和平的条件下去工作，去奋斗。过去因为战争的关系，解放区主要在农村，现在不但接收红河三角洲，接收许多新解放的城市和乡村，还要进入河内、海防等大城市。这样便要求不仅要管理农村，还要管理城市，管理工业、铁路等等。过去因为战争，特别是在游击战争的情况下，各地区和各部门不得不保持一定程度的分散性，这在当时是必要的、正确的；但是现在已经有条件来实现集中统一的领导。停战协定规定双方军队暂时分南、北集结，这就要求两个区域必须和平相处，以便将来举行全国普选、实现统一、完成独立、民主。
    胡志明主席指出，越南人民要在新的形势中去继续完成民族民主运动的全部事业，在今后一个时期中，越南人民的总任务是：第一，巩固和平，防止和克服一切破坏停战协定的阴谋；第二，积极完成土地改革，恢复和提高生产，加强国防力量，建设北部；第三，实现全国统一、独立和民主。
    胡志明主席说，越南人民为实现总任务当前进行的最重要的一件工作就是巩固停战、巩固和平。越南人民一方面要坚决履行停战协定，另一方面要高度警惕并粉碎美帝国主义和法国少数好战分子破坏停战、破坏和平的一切阴谋活动。这是一场相当复杂、艰巨、长期的斗争。
    胡志明主席说：为了巩固停战、巩固和平，我们还有许多工作要做。我们要接管好新解放的乡村和城市，努力医治战争创伤，恢复国民经济，开展对外贸易和城乡交流，在这个基础上发展生产、改善人民生活。我们要巩固越南劳动党，巩固民主政权和人民军，巩固工农联盟，团结城市资产阶级、知识分子和开明士绅，正确执行宗教信仰自由的宗教政策，加强全国人民爱国大团结，扩大和发展民族民主统一战线。一切赞成和平、统一、独立和民主的人，不管过去是不是和对方合作过，我们都要争取和联合他们。我们要和法国继续通过协商谈判的道路，在平等互利的基础上调整关系，并开展经济贸易活动，加强两国人民之间的团结友谊；在互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的五大原则的基础上，和柬埔寨、老挝建立关系；加强和亚洲各国的团结；牢牢地站在和平民主力量这边；为反对美国战争政策、反对东南亚侵略集团，为实现越南的统一、独立、民主而不懈地奋斗。
    胡志明主席说：新形势要求我们做的工作是很多的。我们要用一根东西把所有的工作连贯起来，这根东西就是正确的政策。一切从和平、统一、独立、民主的利益出发，一切从发展生产、繁荣经济着眼；这是我们政策的基本出发点。譬如，我们对新接收城市的基本方针就是保护城市、建设城市的方针。因此，我们进城以后的首要工作就是保护公共财产免遭破坏，维持城市中的社会秩序和正常生活，复工、复市、复课，维持粮食和一切必需品的供给，维持水电、邮政、交通、医院等公共事业的照常活动，留用原有人员，按照原薪发给工资。
    胡志明主席最后以十分坚定的口气说：当然，摆在我们面前的困难是很多的，障碍也不少，但我相信经过全党、全军和全体人民的一致努力，和平、统一、独立、民主的新越南必定会建立起来。
