    Wuhan Branch of the Chinese Writers Association and Wuhan Cultural Bureau Jointly Hold Creative Meeting
    Discuss Strengthening Literary and Artistic Creation Reflecting Flood Control Struggle
    The Wuhan Branch of the Chinese Writers Association (formerly the Central South Writers Association) and the Wuhan Cultural Bureau jointly convened a creative meeting on August 31 to study and discuss how the literary and artistic circles can strengthen creation and further carry out propaganda work during the flood control struggle in Wuhan.

    Yu Heiding, chairman of the Wuhan Branch of the Chinese Writers Association, pointed out at the meeting: Since the beginning of flood control, although literary, musical, and artistic workers have created some works, and some of these works have been loved by the masses and have played a certain role in promoting flood control work, the current creation reflecting flood control is far from meeting the needs of reality. At present, flood control work has continued to deepen, therefore it is required that literary and artistic workers reflect the flood control struggle more deeply. It is necessary to organize the existing forces of the literary and artistic circles, strengthen leadership in a timely manner, and solve the problems and difficulties encountered by literary and artistic workers in the flood control work, in order to better write works reflecting the flood control struggle. Finally, he requested that "Changjiang Literature and Art," "Changjiang Daily," and "Worker Literature and Art" strengthen their connection with literary and artistic workers, and organize writers to write some combative news reports in a timely manner, in order to encourage the people to fight for the final victory over the flood. At the meeting, everyone launched into discussions and unanimously expressed their willingness to go deep into life, share weal and woe with the flood control army, write works, and record the great and glorious flood control struggle in Wuhan in literary and artistic forms, in order to educate and inspire the people. Zeng Dun, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, pointed out that although the water level in Wuhan is gradually decreasing, the serious threat to Wuhan still exists. The paralyzing thoughts generated by the decline in water level are very serious and very dangerous, and must be overcome. He pointed out that it is necessary to further organize literary and artistic workers to participate in flood control work. Literary and artistic workers must go deep into life, first help the masses reverse this paralyzing thought, overcome individualism, establish a long-term combat thinking, and fight to the end for the final victory over the flood. Li Erzhong, First Deputy Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Commander-in-Chief of Wuhan Flood Control, pointed out the great significance of this flood control struggle. He said: The reason why this flood control struggle can overcome the floods of the past hundred years and protect the famous city of Wuhan is mainly due to the Party's education of the people in the past four or five years and the improvement of the people's political consciousness, which is a major test of the Party's leadership of the people over the past few years. Literary and artistic workers should recognize this characteristic and prominently reflect the new morality and qualities displayed by the people in this great and glorious struggle, so that the new heroes who have emerged in this flood control struggle are recorded in the history of Wuhan, in order to educate the people and inspire the people to strive for the cause of socialist construction.

    中国作家协会武汉分会、武汉市文化局联合召开创作会议
    讨论加强反映防汛斗争的文学艺术创作
    中国作家协会武汉分会（即原中南作家协会）、武汉市文化局于八月三十一日，联合召开了创作会议，研究、讨论了文学艺术界如何加强创作，进一步开展武汉市防汛斗争中的宣传工作。
    中国作家协会武汉分会主席于黑丁在会上指出：自防汛以来，虽然文学、音乐、美术工作者，也创造了一些作品，有的作品也得到广大群众的喜爱，对防汛工作起到了一定推动作用，但目前的反映防汛的创作还远远赶不上现实的需要。目前防汛工作已继续深入，因此要求文学艺术工作者，更深入地反映防汛斗争。必须把文学艺术界的现有力量组织起来，及时加强领导，解决文艺工作者在防汛工作中遇到的问题与困难，以求得更好地写出反映防汛斗争的作品来。最后他要求“长江文艺”、“长江日报”和“工人文艺”要加强与文学艺术工作者的联系，组织作家及时写些富于战斗性的通讯报道，以期及时鼓舞人民为最后战胜洪水而奋斗。会上，大家纷纷展开讨论，一致表示愿意深入生活，与防汛大军共甘苦，写出作品，把武汉市伟大的辉煌的防汛斗争用文学艺术形式记载下来，以教育人民、鼓舞人民。中共武汉市委宣传部部长曾惇指出目前武汉市的水位虽然逐渐下降，但对武汉市的严重威胁仍然存在。因水位下降而产生的麻痹思想是很严重而且是很危险的，必须加以克服。他指出必须进一步组织文艺工作者参加防汛工作。文艺工作者必须要深入生活，首先帮助群众扭转这种麻痹思想，克服个人主义思想，树立持久作战思想，为最后战胜洪水而斗争到底。中共武汉市委第一副书记、武汉防汛副总指挥李尔重指出这次防汛斗争的重大意义。他说：这次防汛斗争所以能战胜百余年来的洪水，保卫住武汉名城，主要是党在四、五年来教育人民，人民群众政治觉悟提高的结果，也就是几年来党领导人民的一次重大考验，文艺工作者应认清这个特点，突出地把人民在这个伟大的辉煌的斗争中所表现的新的道德、品质反映出来，使在这次防汛斗争中涌现出来的新的英雄人物记载在武汉的历史中，以教育人民、鼓舞人民，为社会主义建设事业而奋斗。
