The people on both sides of the Jingjiang River have now overcome the unprecedented floods of the past century and preserved the Jingjiang Dike. Now the water level in Shashi, Jingjiang River, has receded below the warning level. Except for a sufficient number of laborers remaining to continue defending the dikes, patrolling, and maintaining vigilance, most of the laborers along the line have returned to their hometowns to resume production.

This year, the flood level along the Jingjiang River in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River broke the highest record of the past century; the Jingjiang Dike was subjected to the flood for a very long time. In early July, the Jingjiang water level exceeded the warning level. By the end of August, a total of six major flood peaks had occurred. In addition, the most intense stage of this year's flood control coincided with a rainstorm, which created many unimaginable difficulties for flood control work. Faced with such an extraordinary flood this year, the local People's Government promptly took various effective measures to ensure that all plans and actions were always ahead of the flood. As early as before the arrival of this year's summer flood season, the local People's Government had mobilized and organized a flood control team of more than 100,000 people, prepared sufficient flood control materials, and put forward the battle slogan of "Ensuring the Jingjiang Dike." After the establishment of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion and Flood Control Headquarters in early July, it actively carried out various preparations for flood diversion. After the first flood peak passed, the people defending the dike immediately seized the gap and rushed to repair the dangerous sections of the dike. On July 22, the Jingjiang water level rose sharply at a rate of five or six centimeters per hour. To ensure the safety of the Jingjiang Dike and the people on both sides of the Yangtze River, when the Shashi water level rose to 44.39 meters, the huge Taipingkou flood inlet gate at the northern end of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area was opened for the first time, diverting a large amount of floodwater and reducing the threat of the flood to the dike. Just as this flood peak was gradually receding, three more dangerous flood peaks came down from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in succession, and the situation was very critical, but the Party and the People's Government's confidence in ensuring the Jingjiang Dike remained firm. At that time, while continuing to open the flood inlet gate for flood diversion, they also actively carried out flood diversion in Shangbailizhou in Zhijiang County and Shangchewan in Jianli County, so that the highest water level in Shashi only reached 44.67 meters, greatly reducing the burden on the Jingjiang Dike. From July 28 to August 10, the Shashi water level remained above 44 meters. At this time, the local CCP Party Committee and the People's Government actively led more than 100,000 soldiers, cadres, and laborers to rush to repair and protect the dike day and night. In early August, they also combined the emergency rescue with the first phase of reinforcing the dike, enabling the dike to successfully survive this most tense stage. In order to finally overcome the flood, the second phase of reinforcement work was carried out in mid-August, and all the dangerous works that had occurred were repaired, so that the sixth flood peak that arrived on August 30 was powerless.

In the victory over this year's extraordinary flood, the people on both sides of the Jingjiang River received the care and strong support of the Central People's Government and the people of the whole country. The major measures of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion and Flood Control Headquarters were carried out under the direct leadership of the Central Government. In terms of flood control materials, whatever the local needs were, the Central Government tried its best to transfer them as quickly as possible. In the nearly two months of flood control, Sichuan, Guangzhou, Chongqing and other places supported the Jingjiang Dike with 690,000 hemp sacks, and more than 580,000 grass bags, reed bags, etc. The Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government supported 49 water pumps, and the Air Force and Navy of the People's Liberation Army also sent aircraft and divers to support. Under the care and support of the Central People's Government and the people of the whole country, the local people were even more fearless of hardships and fought tenaciously against the flood. Among them was Yuan Youfa, the county magistrate of Shishou County, who gloriously sacrificed his life while rescuing a breach; there were the emergency rescue team members of the Caoshi District of Jiangling County, who braved the wind and rain and jumped into a water pond more than one zhang deep to build a floating bridge more than ten zhang long in three hours, ensuring that the earthwork for emergency rescue arrived at the construction site quickly. There was Cai Xixiong, a naval diver who insisted on working in the deep water layer. There was Dong Renxiu, the female township chief of Jiangling County, who insisted on taking care of the lives of the laborers on the dike day and night, and also took the lead in going into the water to rescue the disaster. The heroic deeds of these model figures in flood control have been widely praised by the local people.

From the 8th to the 10th, the Jingjiang Flood Diversion and Flood Control Headquarters solemnly held the Jingjiang Flood Control and Flood Diversion Hero Model Representative Conference in Shashi to celebrate the brilliant victory in defending the Jingjiang Dike, and to commend and award certificates to the flood control heroes.

    荆江两岸人民保住荆江大堤
    战胜百年以来空前未有的洪水
    荆江两岸人民现已战胜百年来空前未有的洪水，保住了荆江大堤。现在荆江沙市水位已退落到警戒水位以下，沿线民工除留有足够数量民工继续防守堤防，巡逻戒备外，大部分已复员回乡生产。
    今年长江中游荆江沿线洪水位打破了百年来最高纪录；荆江大堤受洪水浸袭时间很长。七月上旬，荆江水位即超过了警戒水位。到八月底共出现六次大洪峰。加之今年防汛最紧张阶段，又遇到暴风雨的袭击，这便给防汛工作造成许多不可想像的困难。面对着今年这样特大的洪水，当地人民政府便及时采取各种有效措施，保证一切计划和行动始终走在洪水前面。早在今年夏汛到来前，当地人民政府就已动员编组了十多万人的防汛队伍，准备了充分的防汛器材，提出了“确保荆江大堤”的战斗口号。七月初，荆江分洪防汛指挥部成立后，就积极进行了分洪的各种准备工作。第一次洪峰过后，防守在大堤上的人们立即抓紧空隙，抢修了大堤的险工险段。七月二十二日，荆江水位曾以每小时五、六公分的速度向上猛涨。为确保荆江大堤和长江两岸人民的安全，当沙市水位涨到四四点三九公尺时，荆江分洪区北端巨大的太平口进洪闸第一次开启闸门，分泄了大量洪水，减轻了洪水对大堤的威胁。正当这次洪峰逐渐退落时，长江上游又连续下来三个险恶洪峰，情况非常紧急，但党和人民政府确保荆江大堤的信心仍很坚定。当时，一面继续开启进洪闸分洪，一面在枝江县上百里洲和监利县上车湾等地主动分洪，使沙市最高水位仅达四四点六七公尺，大大地减轻了荆江大堤的负担。七月二十八日到八月十日，沙市水位始终持续在四十四公尺以上。这时当地中共党委和人民政府便积极领导十多万部队战士、机关干部和民工夜以继日地抢险护堤。八月初，又结合抢险及时进行了第一期加固大堤工程，使大堤胜利度过了这个最紧张的阶段。为了最后战胜洪水，八月中旬又进行了第二期加固工程，所有发生过的险工都得到整修，使八月三十日到来的第六次洪峰已无能为力。
    荆江两岸人民在战胜今年特大洪水中，得到中央人民政府和全国人民的关怀和有力地支持。荆江分洪防汛指挥部的重大措施都是在中央直接领导下进行的。在防汛器材方面，当地需要什么，中央就尽力尽速调来。在近两个月的防汛中，四川、广州、重庆等地支援荆江大堤防汛用的麻袋达六十九万条，草包、蒲包等五十八万多条。中央人民政府水利部支援的抽水机有四十九部，人民解放军空军和海军部队并派出飞机和潜水员前来支援。当地人民在中央人民政府和全国人民关怀、支援下，更不畏艰险，和洪水进行顽强的斗争。他们中间有为抢救溃口而光荣牺牲的石首县县长原有发；有冒着狂风暴雨跳到一丈多深的水塘里，以三小时时间架起一座十多丈长的浮桥，保证抢险土方迅速抵达工地的江陵县草市区的抢险突击队员。有潜入深水层坚持工作的海军潜水员蔡式熊。有日夜坚持在堤上照顾民工生活，并曾带头下水抢险的江陵县女乡长董仁秀。这些防汛中的模范人物的功迹，已为当地人民广泛赞扬。
    八日到十日，荆江分洪防汛指挥部在沙市隆重举行了荆江防汛分洪英雄模范代表大会，庆祝保卫荆江大堤取得的辉煌胜利，并向防汛功臣们贺功和颁发奖状。（新华社）
