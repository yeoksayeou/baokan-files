Shanghai's first municipal Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital—the Eleventh People's Hospital—opened on August 29th.

The hospital will focus on traditional Chinese medicine and herbs, combined with scientific diagnostic methods. Through clinical experiments, it will sort out and promote the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine to better serve the health of the general public. The hospital has both inpatient and outpatient departments. The departments are divided into Internal Medicine (including Gynecology), Pediatrics, and Acupuncture. The inpatient department initially has 50 beds. The hospital is equipped with a research laboratory, nutrition room, laboratory, and traditional Chinese medicine preparation room. In addition, an academic research committee has been established to invite experts in traditional Chinese medicine and modern medicine from various departments in Shanghai to conduct research on traditional Chinese medicine. The outpatient department is located in the Yulin District, one of the concentrated industrial areas, and will be able to receive 200 outpatients daily.

At the opening ceremony of the hospital, responsible comrades from the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government and the Cultural Education and Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government delivered speeches, calling for strengthening unity and cooperation between traditional Chinese medicine and modern medicine in their work through this newly established traditional Chinese medical institution.
