    Helped Us Increase Production
    National People's Congress Representative, Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative Chairman, Geng Changsuo
    Our agricultural production cooperative has been established for more than ten years now. In this long period, I and all the members have deeply realized that agricultural production cooperatives must be closely integrated with supply and marketing cooperatives in order to grow and strengthen continuously. Because only when the two of us are closely integrated can we gradually expand the socialist commercial position in rural areas and weaken the exploitation and influence of rural capitalist commerce on us. Only in this way can we enable the state to obtain sufficient agricultural and sideline products through the supply and marketing cooperatives to meet the needs of industrial production and urban people's lives. At the same time, we can buy production materials and living materials of good quality and low price from the supply and marketing cooperatives. This plays a great role in supporting the country's socialist construction, helping us complete agricultural production increase plans, and ensuring the further consolidation and development of agricultural production cooperatives.
    Now, I can use facts to illustrate: In the summer of 1952, our agricultural production cooperative suffered a relatively serious insect plague. At that time, in the vast fields, cotton, peanuts, beans, sorghum, and even trees were densely covered with a layer of reddish-brown red spiders, and large patches of crop leaves were bitten and withered. At this critical moment, the supply and marketing cooperative supplied us with effective weapons for eliminating pests – sprayers and tobacco leaves, sulfur medicine sources. We used these weapons to basically eliminate the red spiders. In addition, we continuously watered the dry land, which ensured that the crop yield this year was not lower than in previous years. The average yield of cotton per mu was more than 200 jin, and the peanut yield was 149 jin. However, individual farmers did not eliminate pests as timely as we did, and they only produced 40 jin of cotton and 80 jin of peanuts per mu. These facts show how important the close integration of supply and marketing cooperatives and us is to ensure our agricultural production increase. Because of this, many individual farmers have organized themselves in order to establish a closer relationship with the supply and marketing cooperatives. After the autumn of this year, our entire village developed from four smaller agricultural production cooperatives to twenty larger agricultural production cooperatives, and twelve mutual aid teams were also organized. As a result, the organized farmers accounted for more than 80% of the total number of farmers in the village.
    In order to further strengthen the integration, we signed an integration contract with the supply and marketing cooperative in the winter of 1952. In order to solve the problem of watering dry land, the integration contract stipulated that the supply and marketing cooperative should supply us with tree palm, iron wire, and bamboo poles needed for drilling hammer wells to ensure that our well-drilling work could proceed smoothly. In the winter of 1952 and the spring of 1953 alone, we drilled twenty hammer wells. In addition to the original thirty-eight hammer wells, we basically solved the problem of watering 600 mu of dry land in the cooperative. In that year, although there was drought first and then flooding, our entire cooperative achieved an average yield of 318 jin per mu, which was 42% more than the yield per mu of local individual farmers. This spring, we continued to sign an integration contract with the supply and marketing cooperative. The supply and marketing cooperative supplied us with a large amount of production materials such as fertilizer powder, pesticides, and seeds; at the same time, it also purchased 120,000 jin of peanut kernels, 40,000 jin of seed cotton, 43 fat pigs, and more than 2,500 jin of hemp rope and 1,500 jin of dry powder of agricultural and sideline products, and prepaid us a deposit of more than 30 million yuan. In this way, all our production cooperative members can concentrate their efforts and feel at ease in production, and we no longer need to worry about the two things of "buying" and "selling."
    Through the integration contract, all our members also know which agricultural and sideline products the country needs us to develop, as well as the specifications and quality of these agricultural products. In this way, we can plant according to the national plan and no longer carry out production blindly. For example, in the past, we did not have the habit and technology of planting cotton in this area, but in order to meet the needs of the country, the cooperative also planted more than 367 mu of cotton this year. We deeply feel that all this is inseparable from the supply and marketing cooperative signing an integration contract with us, guaranteeing to supply us with more production materials and guiding us to carry out production in a planned way. As everyone said: Signing an integration contract has "three savings": first, it saves labor, we don't need to go to the market to buy and sell things, which is labor-intensive; second, it saves money, because the things in the supply and marketing cooperative are cheaper than private merchants; third, it saves worry, we no longer worry that the things we buy cannot be used.

    帮助了我们增产
    全国人民代表大会代表  耿长锁农业生产合作社社长  耿长锁
    我们农业生产合作社自建立到现在已经有十年多的历史了。在这段长期的经历中，我和全体社员都深切体验到：农业生产合作社必须同供销合作社密切结合，才能使农业生产合作社不断地成长和壮大。因为，只有我们两者密切结合，才能逐步扩大农村社会主义商业阵地，削弱农村资本主义商业对我们的剥削和影响。也只有如此，我们才能使国家通过供销合作社掌握到足够的农副产品，供应工业生产和城市人民生活的需要，同时，我们可以从供销合作社买到物美价廉的生产资料和生活资料。这对支持国家的社会主义建设，以及帮助我们完成农业增产计划，保证进一步巩固和发展农业生产合作社，起着很大作用。
    现在，我可以拿事实来说明：在一九五二年的夏天，我们农业生产合作社曾经遭受了一次比较严重的虫灾。当时，在广阔的田野上，棉花、花生、豆子、高粱，甚至树上都密密地爬着一层红糊糊的红蜘蛛，成块成块地庄稼叶子被虫咬得枯黄了。在这个紧张的关头，供销合作社把消灭虫害的有效武器——喷雾器和烟叶、硫黄药水源源地供应给我们。我们拿着这些武器，把红蜘蛛基本上消灭了。再加上我们对干旱的土地进行连续的浇水，就使得这年的农作物产量并不低于往年。平均每亩棉花产二百多斤，花生产一百四十九斤。可是单干农民由于不如我们除治虫害这样及时，他们每亩只产棉花四十斤，花生产八十斤。这些事实说明，供销合作社和我们密切结合，对于保证我们农业增产有多大的作用。正因为如此，许多单干农民都纷纷组织起来，以便与供销合作社取得更密切的结合。这年秋后，我们全村由四个规模较小的农业生产合作社，发展到规模较大的二十个农业生产合作社，另外还组织了十二个互助组。结果，组织起来的农户达到全村总农户的百分之八十以上。
    为了进一步加强结合，在一九五二年冬季我们和供销合作社订立了结合合同。为了解决旱地的浇水问题，在结合合同里规定：供销合作社供应我们打锤井需要的树棕、铁丝和竹竿等东西，保证我们打井工作能够顺利地进行，仅在一九五二年冬和一九五三年春天，我们就打锤井二十眼，另外再加上原有锤井三十八眼，基本上解决了社内的六百亩旱地的浇水问题，就在这年，虽然先旱后涝，我们全社达到了每亩平均三百一十八斤的产量，比较当地单干农民每亩的产量多百分之四十二。今年春天，我们又继续和供销合作社订立结合合同，供销合作社供应了我们大量的肥田粉、农药和种籽等生产资料；同时还收购我们的花生果十二万斤，籽棉四万斤，肥猪四十三口，以及农副产品二千五百多斤麻绳和一千五百斤干粉，并预付给我们定金三千多万元。这样，我们全体生产合作社社员就可以集中力量，安心生产，对于“买”和“卖”这两件事再不需要我们操心了。
    通过结合合同，我们全体社员也知道了国家需要我们发展那些农副产品，以及这些农产品的规格和质量等，这样，我们就可以按照国家计划去种植，不再盲目进行生产了。譬如过去我们这个地方没有种植棉花的习惯和技术、但为了适应国家的需要，今年社里也种植了三百六十七亩多棉花。我们深深感到：这一切都与供销合作社和我们订立结合合同，保证供应我们以较多的生产资料和指导我们有计划进行生产分不开的。正如大家所说的：订了结合合同有“三省”：一是省工，不需我们到集上买卖东西费工；二是省钱，因供销合作社的东西，样样都比私商便宜；三是省心，不再担心买来的东西不能用了。
