Women in Anshan Iron and Steel Production and Construction
By our reporter Chang Gong

When people see the vigorous development of our country's economic construction, they naturally think of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, our country's first iron and steel industrial base. People will also think of the thousands upon thousands of workers and the tense and arduous lives they lead day and night to supply the country with large quantities of steel. However, it is hard for people to imagine that thousands of women here are also integrating their hard work into steel.

Female geological workers carrying probes and instruments are climbing mountains and wading through rivers, conducting intense surveys; in a newly built six-story white building in the city center, countless female designers are meticulously drawing the future of Anshan Iron and Steel; on the spiderweb-like transportation lines, many young female drivers are speeding along in cars or trams; entering the large-scale construction sites, female bricklayers, female welders, female installers, female foremen, female excavator operators, and female grader operators are also working intensely in the air, on the ground, and underground; at the same time, in iron smelting plants, steelmaking plants, and many huge and complex steel rolling plants, where people used to think it was impossible for women to work, there are now female crane operators, female lathe operators, and female operators. …

I visited Shen Ce, the Anshan City Federation of Trade Unions chairman and Anshan City representative to the National People's Congress. He said: "The number of women participating in the production and construction of Anshan Iron and Steel has increased year by year with the development of the country's planned economic construction. To date, the total number has reached more than 6,700. Among these women, more than 800 are engineers and technicians, more than 3,000 are skilled workers and ordinary workers mastering various technologies, and the other more than 2,800 are enterprise administrative management cadres, party organizations, and mass organization workers. Among these personnel, there are factory directors, managers, and party committee secretaries.

"These women come from all over the country, and most of them are students who have graduated from schools and girls from the countryside. Some of them have never seen a factory before and are a little scared when they first enter Anshan Iron and Steel. Some have very little education and don't know what to do when they see those strange machines." Comrade Shen Ce continued: "However, the Party's infinite care for them, the encouragement of heroic deeds, and especially their desire to love the motherland, love labor, and love socialism have given them the greatest confidence and strength to overcome all the difficulties on the road ahead and quickly master the technology. Many of them have become advanced producers and advanced workers."

On the No. 2 coking oven of the Chemical Plant, there is a female deputy director named Zhou Rong. She was a student who graduated from school a few years ago. When she first arrived at the coking oven, people were afraid that she would not be able to persevere. However, over the past few years, she has not only persevered but has also organized a technical research association with the workers to improve many of the mechanical equipment and operating methods on the coking oven. The improvement of only one piece of equipment alone increases the country's production by 1,600 tons of coke per year. She said: "Working on the coking oven, being smoked and baked by the fire, and running up and down is indeed very tiring, but when I think that our hard work will be exchanged for a socialist society, I feel energetic."

In the mining area under exploration, the stories of female surveyors Ma Luanying, Zhang Rongxuan, and Zhu Xingan also leave a deep impression on people. They all know that this work is very hard, but they also know the importance of this work. In Ma Luanying's words, that is: "We are standing on the front lines of the motherland's construction. To refine a large amount of steel, we rely on us to discover a large amount of treasure." In their work, they are never afraid of difficulties. Sometimes, in order to measure a complete terrain, they often have to climb from one hilltop to another. There is no road in between, and Zhang Rongxuan points to the opposite hilltop and says, "The road is made by people walking." They bravely broke through the thorns and climbed that hilltop.

Many female designers have also given full play to their initiative and creativity, saving a lot of funds for the country and making many new designs in the process of design work. Among them, there is a female designer named Huang Dihua who always pays attention to fully and rationally utilizing old equipment or reducing equipment as much as possible to save funds for the country every time she accepts a design task. She said: "This is an important method for us to build socialism, and every designer should pay special attention to this." Last August, when designing a saturator for the No. 2 recovery field of the Chemical Plant, she proposed a rationalization proposal to reduce one saturator based on the principle of saturator efficiency proposed by Soviet experts and based on her actual observations of the coking oven, saving the country 500 million yuan.

In the large steel rolling plant, seamless steel pipe plant built last year, and the second thin plate plant built this year, many workbenches are manned by female operators. If people don’t talk to them, they would never believe that just over a year ago, they were all girls from the countryside and housewives. When they first arrived at the factory, they didn't understand anything and didn't dare to approach those rotating machines. But when they thought that our country had female pilots, female train drivers, and female tractor drivers, they were determined to overcome difficulties and learn technology well. Bai Suhua, a female operator on the pipe rolling machine operating platform in the hot rolling section of the seamless steel pipe plant, said: "When I think of these, I have special strength. I go to the factory to learn technology during the day, and I go to vocational school to study at night. Sometimes, when I think of the things I learned at night and can't sleep, I secretly turn on the flashlight in the quilt to study again. I even use my toothbrush and cup as a pipe rolling machine to practice when I wash my face in the morning." Finally, they finally mastered the technology. When these factories started operations one after another, they all happily went to the workbenches and skillfully flipped the buttons.

"Such a large number of women participating in the heavy industrial labor of Anshan Iron and Steel and playing a certain role in production and construction is the first time in the history of our country's heavy industry." Comrade Shen Ce said after telling me many stories: "However, without the country's planned economic construction, especially the construction of many modern socialist factories and mines in Anshan Iron and Steel with the help of the Soviet Union, not excluding women in these factories and mines, but being able to equally absorb women to participate in labor production; and caring about 'people's' health, transforming many old and backward factories and mines into modern factories and mines through the technical innovation movement, replacing heavy physical labor with mechanization and automation, it would be fundamentally impossible for a large number of women to participate in the heavy industrial labor of Anshan Iron and Steel."

Then, Comrade Shen Ce took the successfully completed seamless steel pipe plant, large steel rolling plant last year, and the second thin plate plant built this year as examples to illustrate that Anshan also had such plants during the enemy and puppet period, but at that time, these plants did not even have a single woman. However, the several plants we have built today have more than 400 women.

Now, the women participating in the production and construction of Anshan Iron and Steel have become an important technical force. They are working everywhere, and their labor is needed everywhere. All of this not only fully illustrates that in our great and lovable motherland, thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and the superiority of our country's people's democratic system, broad roads have been opened up for women everywhere, but also fully illustrates that the working women of our country, for their own complete liberation and the happiness of the people of the whole country, are dedicating everything to the country's early transition to a beautiful human society - a socialist society.

    鞍钢生产建设中的妇女
    本报记者　常工
    当人们看到我国的经济建设蓬勃发展的时候，自然就会想到我国的第一个钢铁工业基地——鞍山钢铁公司，人们更会想到那些成千上万的工人，想到他们为了供应全国大量的钢铁，日日夜夜所经历着的那些紧张和艰苦的生活。然而，人们却很难想像，就在这里，数以千计的妇女，也把自己的辛勤劳动融汇在钢铁里。
    背着探尺和仪器的女地质工作者，正在爬山涉水，紧张地进行勘察；在市中心新修起来的一座六层白色的大楼里，又有无数的女设计工作者，正在精心地描绘着鞍钢的未来；在密如蛛网的交通线上，许多年青的女司机，正在驾驶着汽车或电车飞一般地奔驰；走进那些规模巨大的工地，女瓦工、女电焊工、女安装工、女领工员、女挖土机手和女铲平机手，也在高空、地面和地下紧张地工作着；同时像过去人们认为妇女根本不可能参加劳动的炼铁厂、炼钢厂、以及许多巨大复杂的轧钢厂，现在也已有了女吊车工、女车床工和女操纵手了。……
    我访问了鞍山市出席全国人民代表大会会议的代表、鞍山市工会联合会主席沈策。他说：“参加鞍钢生产建设的妇女，是随着国家有计划的经济建设的开展逐年增加的，到目前为止，总数已达六千七百多名。这些妇女当中，有八百多名是工程师和技术员，三千多名是掌握着各种技术的技术工和普通工，其他两千八百多名，则是企业行政管理干部、党组织和群众团体的工作人员，在这些人员当中，有厂长、经理和党委书记。
    “这些妇女，都是从全国各地来的，其中绝大部分是从学校出来的学生和来自农村的姑娘。她们有的从来都没有见过工厂，乍一走进鞍钢，还有些害怕；有的文化程度很低，看到那些奇奇怪怪的机器，更不知道怎么办才好。”沈策同志继续说：“可是，党对她们的无限关怀，英雄事迹对她们的鼓舞，特别是她们热爱祖国、热爱劳动、热爱社会主义的愿望，却使她们有了最大的信心和力量，战胜了前进道路上的一切困难，并很快地掌握了技术，其中并有不少的人，已经成为先进生产者和先进工作者了。”
    在化工总厂第二号炼焦炉上，有一个名叫周熔的女副主任。她是几年前才从学校毕业出来的一个学生。初到炼焦炉时，人们都怕她坚持不下来。但是几年来，她不但坚持下来，并且还和工人们在一起，组织了一个技术研究会，改进了炼焦炉上不少的机械设备和操作方法。其中仅某项设备的改进，每年就为国家增产一千六百吨焦炭。她说：“在炼焦炉上工作，烟薰火烤，跑上跑下，有时的确很累很乏，可是，当自己一想到我们的辛勤劳动，将换取得社会主义社会的时候，自己也就有劲了。”
    在正在勘察的矿区里，女测量员马鸾莺、张容轩和朱新淦的故事，也留给人们深刻的印象。她们都知道这个工作是很艰苦的，但是她们更知道这个工作的重要性。用马鸾莺的话来说，那就是：“我们是站在祖国建设的前哨上，要炼出大量的钢铁，就靠我们来发掘出大量的宝藏。”她们在工作中，从来也不怕困难。有时她们为了测量一个完整的地形，常常要从这个山头爬上另外的一个山头，中间没有路，张容轩就指着对面的山头说：“路是人走出来的。”她们就这样勇敢地冲破荆棘爬上那个山头。
    许多女设计工作者，也都发挥了积极性和创造性，在设计工作的过程中，为国家节省了不少资金，并做出很多新的设计。她们之中，有一个叫黄棣华的女设计员，每次接受设计任务时，总是注意充分合理地利用旧设备或是尽可能地减少设备，为国家节省资金。她说：“这是我们建设社会主义的重要方法，每一个设计工作者都要特别注意这一点。”去年八月，为化工总厂第二回收场设计饱和器时，她根据苏联专家提出的饱和器效能的原理，根据她到炼焦炉实际观察的结果，提出了减少一台饱和器的合理化建议，为国家节省了五亿元的资金。
    在去年建成的大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂以及今年建成的第二薄板厂里，许多工作台上都是女操纵手，如果人们不和她们谈，绝对不会相信在一年多以前，她们都还是农村的姑娘和家庭妇女。她们刚到工厂时，什么也不懂，看到那些转动的机器都不敢靠前。但是她们一想起，我国有了女飞行员、女火车司机、女拖拉机手的时候，就决心克服困难，学好技术。无缝钢管厂热轧工段轧管机操作台上的女操纵手白素华说：“我一想到这些，力量就特别大，白天到工厂学技术，晚上又到业余学校去学习，有时夜里想起学习的东西睡不着觉，就偷偷在被窝里打着手电棒再学，甚至在早上洗脸时，还把牙刷和牙缸比做轧管机练习呢。”最后，她们终于掌握了技术。当这些工厂陆续开工的时候，她们就都愉快地走上了工作台，熟练地扳动着电钮。
    “像这样大批妇女参加鞍钢重工业劳动，并在生产和建设上起一定的作用，这在我国重工业历史上，还是第一次。”沈策同志在给我讲完了许多故事后这样说：“但是，如果没有国家有计划的经济建设，特别是在苏联帮助下在鞍钢建设起许多个现代化的社会主义厂矿，在这些厂矿里不排斥妇女，而能平等的吸收妇女参加劳动生产；并且十分关怀
  “人”的健康，通过技术革新运动把许多旧有的、落后的厂矿改建为现代化的厂矿，以机械化和自动化代替繁重的体力劳动，那么大批妇女参加鞍钢的重工业劳动则是根本不可能的。”
    接着，沈策同志就以去年胜利完成的无缝钢管厂、大型轧钢厂和今年建成的第二薄板厂为例来说明，在敌伪时期，鞍山也曾有过这样的厂，但那时这些厂却连一个妇女也没有。但是，我们今天建成的这几个厂，却拥有四百多个妇女了。
    现在参加鞍钢生产和建设的妇女，已经成为一支重要的技术力量。她们在各处劳动着，各处也都需要她们的劳动。这一切，不仅仅充分地说明在我们这样伟大可爱的祖国里，由于有了共产党和毛主席的领导，和我们国家人民民主制度的优越性，处处都为妇女开辟了广阔的道路，同时也充分地说明了我国的劳动妇女，为了自己的彻底解放和全国人民的幸福，正在为祖国早日过渡到人类美好的社会——社会主义社会而献出自己的一切。
