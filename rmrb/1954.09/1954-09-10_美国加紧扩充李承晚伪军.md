    US Intensifies Expansion of the Syngman Rhee Puppet Army
    [Xinhua News Agency, 8th] The United States is stepping up its assistance to the Syngman Rhee clique in accelerating military expansion to maintain the threat against the Korean armistice. According to Lee He (transliteration), the "Vice Minister of National Defense" of South Korea, the plan to expand the South Korean armed forces based on the recent agreement reached in Washington has been implemented since the beginning of September. This agreement was the result of the South Korean "Minister of National Defense," Sun Yuan-il, continuing to have "more detailed discussions" with the US government after Syngman Rhee went to the United States for negotiations. According to Agence France-Presse, the United States will give South Korea more jet fighters and bombers, as well as some escort frigates and submarine chasers. United Press also revealed that the United States has also expressed its willingness to help South Korea establish a reserve force of about ten divisions in addition to the current twenty active combat divisions.
    The Syngman Rhee clique is frantically preparing for military expansion. It has decided to send a large number of "resident military officers" and "military instructors" to schools—increasing the number of "officers" and "instructors" stationed in each middle school from one each to one each for every four classes. The Syngman Rhee clique has also stipulated that October 5 to October 30 will be the so-called "period for reviewing students' military discipline," ordering all secondary schools and normal schools to force students to undergo military training during this period using all class time. At the same time, students from universities and colleges will be concentrated at the Lee puppet army infantry school in Gwangju, Jeolla Province, to receive military training. South Korea's "Dongyang News Agency" admitted that the expansion of military training is related to the plan to expand the Syngman Rhee puppet army.
    South Korean newspaper "Chosun Ilbo" pointed out that South Korean students expressed strong dissatisfaction with this action by the Syngman Rhee regime. The newspaper also cited an example: students openly disobeyed the orders of military training instructors. Many students have been arrested as a result.

### 美国加紧扩充李承晚伪军

    美国加紧扩充李承晚伪军
    【新华社八日讯】美国正在加紧帮助李承晚集团加速扩军，以保持对朝鲜停战的威胁。据南朝鲜“国防部副长官”李贺（译音）五日说，依据最近在华盛顿达成的协议来扩充南朝鲜武装力量的计划从九月初已开始实行。这个协议是南朝鲜“国防部长官”孙元一在李承晚赴美国谈判后继续和美国政府“进行更详细的讨论”的结果。据法新社消息，美国将要再给南朝鲜一些喷气式战斗机和轰炸机以及一些护航快舰和驱潜舰。合众社还透露，美国也已表示愿意帮助南朝鲜在目前二十个现役战斗师以外，再建立一支约十师人的后备部队。
    李承晚集团已在疯狂地进行扩军的准备工作。它决定增派大量的“驻校军官”和“军事教官”到学校里去——从以前每一所中学校派驻“军官”和“教官”各一人，增加到每四个班就各派驻一名。李承晚集团又规定十月五日到十月三十日为所谓“检阅学生军事纪律的时期”，命令所有中等学校和师范学校在此时期间用全部上课时间强迫学生受军事训练。同时，大学和专科学校的学生要集中到全罗南道光州的李伪军步兵学校去受军事训练。南朝鲜“东洋通讯社”承认，军事训练的扩大是和扩充李承晚伪军的计划有关的。
    南朝鲜报纸“朝鲜日报”指出，南朝鲜学生对于李承晚政权的这种行动表示强烈的不满。报纸还举例说：学生公开不服从军事训练教官的命令。许多学生因此而被捕。
