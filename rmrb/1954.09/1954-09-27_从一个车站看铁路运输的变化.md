Seeing the Changes in Railway Transportation from a Station
By our reporter Gu Lei

The Sujiatun Station is located southeast of Shenyang. In this station, you won't see magnificent station buildings, tall overpasses, or very long concrete platforms. But here, there is a dense network of shunting lines, with trains coming and going in a constant stream. Sujiatun Station, with its enormous marshalling capacity, undertakes an ever-increasing transportation task.

This station suffered severe damage from the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops during the liberation. The steel rails of the marshalling yard were torn up, and eighteen bunkers were built inside the station. Trenches were everywhere, all the signaling and lighting equipment was destroyed. The entire station was on the verge of destruction in the fires of war, but also welcomed new life in the fires of war. In the early days after liberation, the signal tower of Sujiatun Station was nailed with wooden boards and hung with straw curtains. All the work was done in the dark at night. Drivers relied on experience to shunt and couple cars, and shunters climbed up and down in the dark, causing constant accidents. A crane was often placed in the marshalling yard, ready to deal with accidents. At that time, the thinking of some workers was very confused, and they did not yet have the idea of being masters of their own affairs. Some were still "point fives" – working half-days. The Sujiatun Station at that time was suffering from the wounds left by the corrupt management of the Kuomintang. Two locomotives worked day and night but could not marshal thirty trains.

Sujiatun Station, like the entire railway, was quickly being transformed. This transformation was carried out in accordance with the direction pointed out by the Party. In 1950, the Sino-Soviet Joint Stock Changchun Railway Company was officially established, and more than a thousand Soviet experts arrived at the Changchun Railway. With the enthusiastic and selfless assistance of Soviet experts, Sujiatun Station, like the Changchun Railway, began a comprehensive restoration and transformation in a planned and step-by-step manner. Since then, the transportation work of Sujiatun Station has gradually moved forward, undertaking more and more transportation tasks each year. In 1949, an average of 2,580 cars arrived and departed daily. In 1950, an average of 3,148 cars arrived and departed daily. In 1954, according to statistics from January to August, an average of 5,600 freight cars arrived and departed daily, with a maximum of 7,300 cars.

In completing the country's transportation plan, the railway workers of Sujiatun Station have made tremendous efforts. All the achievements of the station's work are reflected in handling more trains and transporting more goods in the shortest possible time. Therefore, the station must load more, marshal faster, and dispatch faster. On the way, drivers must drive faster under safe conditions. In order to achieve this goal, all employees of Sujiatun Station have strived to learn from Soviet advanced experience, engage in creative labor, and try every means to save time, striving not to let a minute slip away in vain. The Dai Tiangeng youth shunting team took the lead in promoting the "Li Xikui Shunting Method," shortening the time to marshal a train from 37 minutes to 23.4 minutes, and reducing the time to disassemble each train from 34 minutes to 18.2 minutes. This new record broke conservative thinking and mobilized all fourteen shunting teams in the station. The transit time of each train in the station was reduced from 8.3 hours to 4.8 hours. Shunter Huang Zhongchen, while learning the advanced experience of "continuous humping," created the method of "using inertia for humping." When the locomotive stopped, he used its inertia to kick out the vehicles to be shunted, improving the efficiency of "continuous humping" and creating a record of continuously kicking out 24 vehicles at one time. Shunter Ren Fugang even created a new working method. When he disassembled trains, he made each shunted car automatically hook up. When one train was shunted, another train was also marshaled. After hooking up the locomotive and caboose, it could be driven away without the need for marshalling time at all. This is an innovation of Sujiatun Station.

Reducing train transit time cannot be achieved solely by the efforts of the shunting teams. It must be coordinated with other work. In the struggle to shorten transit time at Sujiatun Station, advanced workers have emerged in various aspects. Line duty officer An Qingxi is responsible for mastering the operation plan of the shunting locomotives of the shunting teams. He strengthened the operation plan, strengthened the connection with various departments, and established a series of systems, so that shunting locomotives can work non-stop, and the marshaled trains can be dispatched immediately, truly achieving non-blind marshalling, improving the operation time of shunting locomotives, and shortening the train's stay in the station. Weigher Zhang Yunling's team learned the "Yang Maolin Loading Method," which not only loaded quickly but also loaded more, increasing the net weight of each freight car from 17 tons to 28.9 tons. She personally created a record of loading 30 tons. This team also found five tricks to increase net weight, and the whole station promoted their experience, greatly improving work efficiency. Signalman Li Qingxi is a model of safe operation. This old worker is 57 years old, has 41 years of service, and has worked as a signalman for 23 years. Since liberation, no accidents have occurred during his shifts.

Through various reforms and the efforts of all employees, the face of Sujiatun Station has completely changed. Every day, trains departing from here, loaded with steel from Anshan and Benxi, coal from Hegang, Fushun, and Fuxin, petroleum from Fushun, and machinery from Shenyang and Dalian, head to many large construction sites across the country; it transports industrial machinery and equipment from foreign countries to various industrial cities; it sends chemical fertilizers, various new agricultural implements, and agricultural machinery such as automobiles, tractors, and combine harvesters from foreign countries to farms and rural areas, and transports agricultural products such as grain, cotton, hemp, tobacco, meat, fruits, and vegetables to industrial and mining areas and cities. Every day, thousands of freight cars arrive at Sujiatun Station and are marshaled and dispatched through Sujiatun Station, loaded with hundreds of thousands of tons of materials. The employees of Sujiatun Station bear this heavy task with hard work.

This is the change of Sujiatun Station in the past five years. These changes show that the restored and transformed Sujiatun Station, like the national railway, is effectively serving the socialist construction of our country.

### 从一个车站看铁路运输的变化

    从一个车站看铁路运输的变化
    本报记者　顾雷
    苏家屯车站，位于沈阳东南。在这个车站里，看不到雄伟的站房、高大的天桥、也看不到延伸很长的混凝土站台。但这里，有一片稠密的调车线路，进出的列车川流不息。苏家屯车站以它的巨大的编组能力，担负着日益增长的运输任务。
    这个车站在解放时，曾遭受蒋匪军惨重的破坏。调车场的钢轨被拆下来，在站内修筑了十八座碉堡，战壕遍地，所有的信号和照明设备都被破坏了，全站在炮火中濒于毁灭，也在炮火中迎接了新生。解放后最初的日子里，苏家屯车站的信号楼上钉着木板、挂着草帘子，晚上一切工作都摸黑干，司机靠经验甩车、挂车，调车员摸黑爬上跳下，事故不断发生，调车场里，经常放一台吊车，准备处理事故。那时，一部分工人的思想非常混乱，还没有当家作主的思想。有的还是“零点五”——干半日工作。当时的苏家屯车站承受着国民党的腐败的管理所遗留下的创伤，两台机车忙一天一夜，编不出三十个列车。
    苏家屯车站，像整个铁路一样很快地被改造着。这种改造，是依照党所指出的方向进行的。一九五零年中苏两国共管的中长铁路公司正式成立，一千多名苏联专家到了中长铁路。在苏联专家热情无私的帮助下，苏家屯车站和中长路一样，有计划、有步骤地开始全面的恢复和改造工作。苏家屯车站的运输工作从此逐步向前迈进，一年比一年承担着更多的运输任务，一九四九年，平均每天到发二千五百八十辆车，一九五零年，平均每天到发三千一百四十八辆，到一九五四年，据一月到八月的统计，平均每天到发的货车达五千六百辆，最高达七千三百辆。
    在完成国家的运输计划中，苏家屯车站的铁路员工作了巨大的努力。车站工作的一切成果，都表现在以最短的时间办理更多的列车，载运更多的货物。因此，车站要装的多、编的快、发的快，在途中司机要在安全的条件下开的快。为达到这个目标，苏家屯车站的全体员工，努力学习苏联先进经验，进行创造性的劳动，想尽一切办法争取时间，力求不让一分钟白白地溜掉。戴天更青年调车组，带头推广了“李锡奎调车法”，把编组一个列车的时间，由三十七分钟缩短到二十三点四分，把解体每一列车的时间，由三十四分钟压缩至十八点二分钟。这个新纪录打破了保守思想，使全站十四个调车组行动起来。全站每个列车的中转时间，由八点三小时降至四点八小时。调车员黄忠臣在学习“连续溜放”先进经验时，创造了“利用惰力溜放”的方法，在机车停车时，利用其惰力把要甩掉的车辆甩出去，提高了“连续溜放”的效率，创造了一次连续甩出二十四辆车的最高纪录。调车员任福光更创造了一种新的工作方法，他在进行列车解体时，使甩掉的每辆车自动地把钩挂上，甩完了一个列车的同时，另一个列车也编成了，挂上车头和守车就可以开走，根本不需要编组的时间。这是苏家屯车站的创举。
    降低列车中转时间，单靠调车组的努力是不行的，必须有其他工作配合。苏家屯车站在争取缩短中转时间的斗争中，涌现出多方面的先进工作者。线路值班员安庆喜，负责掌握调车组的调车机车作业计划。他加强了作业计划，加强与各部门之间的联系，建立了一系列制度，使调车机车可以永不休止地工作，使编好的列车马上可以开出站去，真正做到了不盲目编车，提高了调车机车的作业时间，缩短了列车在站内停留的时间。司磅员张云玲小组学习“杨茂林装车法”，不但装的快，而且装的多，使每辆货车的净载重量由十七吨提高到二十八点九吨，她个人创造了装三十吨的纪录。这个小组还找到五个提高净载重的窍门，全站推广了她们的经验，大大提高了工作效率。信号员李庆喜，是安全运行的模范。这位老工人已五十七岁，有四十一年工龄，已做了二十三年信号员的工作。从解放后到现在，他值班的时候从来没有发生过任何事故。
    经过各种改革和全体员工的努力，苏家屯车站的面貌完全变了。每天由这里开出的列车，装载着鞍山和本溪的钢铁，鹤岗、抚顺和阜新的煤、抚顺的石油，沈阳和大连的机器，驶向全国许多巨大的建设工地；它把来自国外的工业机械设备输送到各个工业城市。把化学肥料，各种新式农具和来自国外的汽车、拖拉机、联合收割机等农业机械送往农场和农村，又把粮食、棉花、麻、烟草、肉类、水果、蔬菜等农产品运往工矿区和城市。每天驰到苏家屯车站，并经苏家屯车站编组发出的数千辆货车上，装载着数十万吨物资，苏家屯车站的员工们以辛勤的劳动担负着这个繁重的任务。
    这便是苏家屯车站五年来的变化。这些变化表明：经过恢复、改造的苏家屯车站，和全国铁路一样正有效地为我国社会主义建设服务着。
