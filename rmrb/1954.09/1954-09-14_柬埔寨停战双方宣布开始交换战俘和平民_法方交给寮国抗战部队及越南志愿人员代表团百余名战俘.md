Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, September 12th: The Cambodian International Supervisory and Inspection Commission, together with the Cambodian Joint Armistice Commission, held a meeting on September 6th in Banane, between Phnom Penh and Svay Rieng. Attending the meeting were representatives from India, Poland, and Canada of the Cambodian International Supervisory and Inspection Commission, Colonel Thanh Son, chief representative of the delegation of the Supreme Command of the Khmer Resistance Forces and the Command of the Vietnamese Volunteer Personnel, and Colonel Lon Nol, chief representative of the delegation of the Supreme Command of the Cambodian Royal Army.

    At the meeting, two issues were discussed: 1. Reviewing the report of the meeting held by the International Supervisory and Inspection Commission and the Joint Armistice Commission on August 27th; 2. Releasing detained prisoners of war and civilians.

    Regarding the first issue, Colonel Thanh Son raised the issue of the qualifications of the delegation he headed, explaining that the delegation represented the Supreme Command of the Khmer Resistance Forces and the Command of the Vietnamese Volunteer Personnel, and not just the Command of the Vietnamese Volunteer Personnel as indicated in the report. This correction was aimed at avoiding any regrettable incidents. Note: Colonel Thanh Son had suggested visiting Khmer resistance fighters and civilians detained by the Cambodian Royal Army. However, the representative of the Cambodian Royal Army refused this suggestion, citing it as an internal affair of Cambodia. In fact, Colonel Thanh Son was making this suggestion on behalf of the Khmer Resistance Forces—which is also responsible for Cambodia's internal affairs.

    Regarding the second issue, the delegations of both sides of the Cambodian Joint Armistice Commission announced their readiness to hand over the first batch of detained prisoners of war and civilians within September. Both sides promised not to wait for the other side when carrying out this work and not to demand simultaneous transfers.

    The delegation of the Supreme Command of the Khmer Resistance Forces and the Command of the Vietnamese Volunteer Personnel stated that it would transfer the first batch of prisoners of war on September 11th and 12th, at the following two locations: Neak Loeung in Prey Veng Province and Suong in Kampong Cham Province.

    The delegation of the Supreme Command of the Cambodian Royal Army stated that it would transfer prisoners of war in Kampong Cham, Kandal, Kampong Chhnang, Takeo, Svay Rieng, Prey Veng, and other places on later dates.

    Both sides agreed that the exchange of prisoners of war would be carried out in the presence of representatives from both sides and representatives from the International Supervisory and Inspection Commission.

Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, September 11th: The delegation of the Lao Resistance Forces and the Vietnamese Volunteer Personnel in Laos and the delegation of the French Federation Forces in Indochina discussed the exchange of prisoners of war on September 8th in Sam Son, Thanh Hoa Province.

    In the afternoon of the same day, the French Federation Forces handed over 109 prisoners of war to the Lao Resistance Forces and the Vietnamese Volunteer Personnel delegation. These people were captured in Laos and had been detained in prisons in Savannakhet, Vientiane, Seno (a town north of Savannakhet), and other places. The released people handed over many letters of accusation to both delegations, accusing the French Federation Forces of their poor treatment. They also revealed the fact that the French side is still detaining 20 Vietnamese people in the Vientiane prison.

    柬埔寨停战双方宣布开始交换战俘和平民
    法方交给寮国抗战部队及越南志愿人员代表团百余名战俘
    【新华社十二日讯】据越南通讯社柬埔寨十一日讯：柬埔寨国际监督和监察委员会同柬埔寨联合停战委员会九月六日在金边市和柴桢之间的巴南举行会议。出席会议的有柬埔寨国际监督和监察委员会的印度、波兰和加拿大三国代表、高棉抗战部队总司令部和越南志愿人员司令部代表团首席代表青山上校和柬埔寨王国军队总司令部代表团首席代表郎诺上校。
    在会议上讨论了两个问题：一、审查国际监督和监察委员会同联合停战委员会在八月二十七日举行的会议的报告；二、释放被拘留的战俘和平民。
    关于第一个问题，青山上校提出了以他为首的代表团的资格问题，说明代表团是代表高棉抗战部队总司令部和越南志愿人员司令部，而不像报告中所指出的那样，只代表越南志愿人员司令部。这个修正的目的是为了避免发生一切令人遗憾的事件。按：青山上校曾经建议访问被柬埔寨王国军队拘留的高棉抗战战士和平民的问题。但是柬埔寨王国军队代表借口这是柬埔寨的内部事务，拒绝了这个建议。事实上，青山上校是代表高棉抗战部队——它也对柬埔寨内部事务负责——提出这个建议的。
    关于第二个问题，柬埔寨联合停战委员会的双方代表团宣布准备在九月份内移交第一批被拘留的战俘和平民。双方都答应在进行这一工作时不等待另一方，并且不要求同时移交。
    高棉抗战部队总司令部和越南志愿人员司令部代表团说，它将在九月十一日和十二日移交第一批战俘，移交地点为以下两处：波萝勉省的乃良和磅湛省的苏恩。
    柬埔寨王国军队总司令部代表团说，它将在后一些的日子在磅湛、干丹、磅清扬、茶胶、柴桢、波萝勉等地移交战俘。
    双方同意，交换战俘的工作将在双方代表及国际监督和监察委员会代表在场的情况下进行。
    【新华社十一日讯】据越南通讯社北越十一日讯：寮国抗战部队及在老挝的越南志愿人员代表团和印度支那法兰西联邦部队代表团于九月八日在清化省参山讨论了双方交换战俘的问题。
    同日下午，法兰西联邦部队移交给寮国抗战部队及越南志愿人员代表团一百零九名战俘，这些人都是在老挝被俘而一直被拘留在沙湾拿吉、万象、塞诺（沙湾拿吉以北的一个城镇）等地监狱中。被释放的人交给双方代表团许多封控诉书，控诉了法兰西联邦部队对他们恶劣的待遇。他们还揭露了法方至今还在万象监狱中拘留二十名越南人的事实。
