    Implementing the unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth and the unified purchase of cotton is an important economic measure and an important political measure for our country at present. It specifically implements the basic policy thinking of the Party and the People's Government. These are: first, the complete unity of national and people's interests; second, the close mutual assistance between urban and rural areas; third, further promoting the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce under the leadership of the state-owned economy. We must make the people of the whole country understand the overall political and economic significance of the unified purchase and sale policy.

    If we only talk about the current economic situation, haggle over a few pounds of cotton and a few feet of cotton cloth, without explaining its political significance and raising the people's political awareness, it is certainly not right. Conversely, if we only talk about the same old general principles, without connecting them with everyone's daily life, so that they understand that there is socialism in life, that is also not right. Because whether it is this or that statement, if it is not a comprehensive explanation, the result will not be able to raise socialist consciousness, inspire mass enthusiasm, and mobilize the people of the whole country to actively implement the policy of unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth and unified purchase of cotton.

    In terms of the relationship between the state and the people, all power in our country belongs to the people, and the interests of the state and the people are completely一致的 (completely unified). The basic starting point of all state policies is to continuously improve and raise the material and cultural life of the people. Cotton and cotton cloth are means of livelihood for the people, second only to food. In recent years, thanks to the state's vigorous efforts to restore and develop the national economy, cotton production and cotton cloth supply have increased significantly. In 1952, the national cotton production was more than 1.29 million tons, reaching more than 290 percent of that in 1949, which was also 52 percent higher than the highest annual output (1936) of more than 840,000 tons before liberation. The supply of cotton cloth in the national market was more than 58 million bolts in 1950, and reached more than 130 million bolts in 1953, which was also much more than the supply in the highest sales year before liberation. This fully demonstrates the state's concern for the people's lives.

    However, our country's economy is developing proportionally, and we must never blindly expand production based solely on market conditions, thereby disrupting the entire economic plan. Therefore, although there is no serious situation of supply falling short of demand for cotton cloth in the short term, in view of the fact that cotton and cotton cloth production is increasingly unable to keep up with the growth in demand, in order to enable planned production and distribution in the long term and to further eliminate market speculation and consolidate price stability, it is necessary to implement the policy of planned purchase and planned supply in a timely manner, which is completely in line with the fundamental interests of the people. What's more, the specific measures for the unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth and the unified purchase of cotton also appropriately take into account the people's desire to improve their lives and provide them with many conveniences. For example, the total supply of cotton cloth this year is still slightly higher than that in 1953; in the future, based on the development of industrial and agricultural production, it will be appropriately increased year by year. In terms of supply quotas, it is stipulated that the necessary supply of cloth for production purposes is guaranteed according to normal production conditions, and the cloth for people's consumption is also differentiated according to the different regional and climatic habits of using cloth and different levels of purchasing power. In addition, it is also stipulated that the purchase of cloth tickets is based on counties and cities as the unit for calculating and issuing tickets, but can be used in markets within a province or in the border areas of two provinces. Undoubtedly, all these measures will be welcomed and supported by the people.

    In terms of the relationship between urban and rural areas, the specific measures for unified purchase of cotton and unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth stipulate that "farmers who produce cotton should sell all the cotton they produce to the state at the purchase price stipulated by the state, except for the agricultural tax and the necessary self-use portion." In the distribution of cotton cloth, the principle of "appropriately reducing urban consumption and supplying more to rural areas" is stipulated. These principles fully embody the new relationship between urban and rural areas in our country. In history, cities and villages were in a relationship of exploitation and being exploited. Only people's democracy and socialist countries fundamentally changed this situation. At present, the cities and villages in our country are specifically manifested as the relationship between workers and peasants, which is a relationship of mutual support and alliance. The consolidation and development of the worker-peasant alliance is a major issue related to the success or failure of socialist construction in our country. As Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "Both poor peasants and middle peasants can only be liberated under the leadership of the proletariat; and the proletariat can only lead the revolution to victory by forming a solid alliance with the poor peasants and middle peasants, otherwise it is impossible." ("The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party")

    In the work of restoring and developing the national economy in our country, the peasants have made tremendous efforts and given great help to cities and industries. All the people in the cities should thank the peasant brothers for their help. Of course, the peasants also need the assistance of the cities, which is to supply them with more means of production and means of livelihood. Especially in recent years, there has been a new change in the rural economy, that is, with the development of agricultural production, the increase in the purchase price of agricultural products, and the result of the unified purchase of grain, oil, and cotton, a large amount of currency has been invested in rural areas, and the purchasing power of peasants has increased sharply. If we do not supply rural areas with more commodities, and do not meet the needs of peasants as much as possible, it will affect their enthusiasm for production, it will damage the alliance between workers and peasants, and at the same time, the idle funds of a large amount of funds in rural areas are not conducive to the country's economic construction. Therefore, using industrial products to first meet the needs of peasants is a major economic and political task.

    Cities should and can vigorously support rural areas. In recent years, the consumption levels of urban people have been much higher than those of rural areas. According to a survey in Jinan City, in 1953, the consumption of cotton cloth per capita was 94.19 chi for cadres of the city's institutions, 92.00 chi for industrial and commercial capitalists, 64.8 chi for workers, and 39.58 chi for residents. However, in many areas, even with the increase in consumption levels in recent years, the actual consumption of cotton cloth per capita per year is only about 10 to 20 chi, some only buy 5 chi of cloth per year, and some only use a small amount of local cloth and do not use machine-woven cloth at all. If we compare large cities like Shanghai and Beijing with rural areas, the disparity will be even greater. Therefore, it is fair and reasonable to reduce urban consumption and supply more to rural areas based on the current purchasing power. In order to support the peasant brothers, the urban people must pay attention to saving cotton cloth consumption in various ways. For example, urban people generally have some clothes in storage, which can still be worn now, so they should wear them for a longer time and make fewer new clothes; even when making new clothes, if you can make cheongsams, you can make cheongsams, and if you can wear skirts, you can wear skirts, changing the habit of men, women, old and young all wearing blue cloth uniforms, which will also save a lot of cloth, and can make our lives more rich and colorful. These methods can be adopted and should be adopted.

    In terms of the relationship between state-owned commerce and private merchants, the order on implementing unified purchase of cotton and unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth stipulates that cotton peddlers shall not engage in trafficking operations, and cotton cloth wholesalers shall not continue to engage in wholesale business, and put cotton cloth retailers into the orbit of state capitalism through distribution, consignment sales and other methods; on the other hand, it also stipulates that the staff of cotton peddlers and cotton cloth wholesalers shall be actively guided by the people's governments at all levels to change their careers, or be arranged by the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company and the supply and marketing cooperatives under the leadership of the local people's government. That is to say, on the one hand, it is necessary to ban the speculative behavior of private merchants, and on the other hand, it is responsible for solving their difficulties, arranging their work, and maintaining the operation of cotton cloth retailers. These measures further implement the policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming private industry and commerce, which is completely in line with the requirements of the general task of the transition period.

    In short, the measures of unified purchase of cotton and unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth involve a wide range and have a great impact on people's living habits. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct in-depth mobilization, correct understanding, and through this measure, further improve the policy level of cadres and the socialist consciousness of the masses. Only in this way can we smoothly implement this policy and further encourage and exert the enthusiasm of the people of the whole country to build socialism.

### 贯彻棉布统购统销和棉花统购的政策

    贯彻棉布统购统销和棉花统购的政策
    棉布的统购统销和棉花的统购，是我们国家当前的重要经济措施，也是重要的政治措施。它具体地贯彻了党和人民政府的基本政策思想。这就是：第一，国家和人民利益的完全一致；第二，城市和农村的亲密互助；第三，在国营经济领导下进一步促进私营工商业的社会主义改造。我们必须使全国人民都明白统购统销政策的全面的政治和经济的意义。
    如果我们只讲目前的经济情况，斤斤计算几斤棉花和几尺棉布，而不讲解它的政治意义，提高人民的政治认识，当然是不对的。相反地，如果只讲千篇一律的大道理，而不和每个人的日常生活相联系，使他们了解生活中也有社会主义，那也是不对的。因为无论是这种或那种说法，如果不是全面的说明，其结果都不能提高社会主义觉悟、鼓舞群众热情，并动员全国人民积极贯彻棉布统购统销和棉花统购的政策。
    就国家和人民的关系来说，我们国家的一切权力都属于人民，国家和人民的利益是完全一致的。国家一切政策的基本出发点，都是为了不断地改善和提高人民的物质和文化生活。棉花和棉布是人民生活中仅次于粮食的生活资料。几年来，由于国家大力恢复和发展国民经济的结果，棉花产量和棉布供应量都有很大增加。一九五二年全国生产棉花一百二十九万多吨，达到一九四九年的百分之二百九十以上，比解放前最高年产量（一九三六年）的八十四万多吨还高出百分之五十二。棉布在一九五○年全国市场上的供应量是五千八百多万疋，一九五三年就达到一亿三千多万疋，比解放前最高销售年度的供应量也多得多。这就充分说明了国家对人民生活的关怀。
    但是，我国的经济是按比例发展的，绝不能仅仅根据市场情况盲目扩大生产，从而破坏整个经济计划。因此，虽然眼前棉布供应还没有出现供不应求的严重情况，但鉴于棉花棉布生产日益赶不上需要增长的速度，为了使今后长期内都能按计划生产和分配，并进一步取缔市场投机和巩固物价的稳定，就必须及时实行计划收购和计划供应的政策，这是完全符合人民的根本利益的。何况在棉布统购统销和棉花统购的具体措施中，也同样适当地照顾了人民改善生活的要求，给了人民很多方便。例如，本年度棉布供应的总量，比一九五三年度仍略有增加；今后在工农业生产发展的基础上，还会逐年适当增加。在供应定额方面，规定了生产用布按正常生产情况保证必要供应量，人民消费用布也根据不同地区、不同气候的用布习惯和不同的购买力水平有所区别。此外，还规定了购布票以县、市为计算发票单位，但可以在一省范围内或两省接壤地区的集市上使用。无疑的，这一切措施，都会得到人民的欢迎和拥护的。
    就城市和农村的关系来说，在棉花统购和棉布统购统销的具体措施中，规定了“凡生产棉花的农民，应按照国家规定的收购价格，将所产棉花，除缴纳农业税和必要的自用部分外，全部卖给国家。”在棉布的分配上规定了“适当少增城市消费，较多供应农村”的原则。这些原则，完全体现了我国城乡间的新的关系。在历史上，城市和乡村是剥削和被剥削的关系，只有人民民主和社会主义国家才根本改变了这种情况。目前我国的城市和乡村，具体表现为工人和农民的关系，而这是互相支援的联盟的关系。工农联盟的巩固和发展，是有关我国社会主义建设成败的重大问题。正如毛泽东同志指出的：“贫农和中农都只有在无产阶级的领导之下，才能得到解放；而无产阶级也只有和贫农、中农结成坚固的联盟，才能领导革命达到胜利，否则是不可能的。”（“中国革命和中国共产党”）
    在我国国民经济的恢复和发展工作中，农民作了巨大的努力，给了城市和工业很大的帮助。所有城市的人民，都应该感谢农民弟兄的帮助。当然，农民也是需要城市的援助的，这就是要更多地供应他们生产资料和生活资料。特别是近年以来，农村经济有了一个新的变化，这就是随着农业生产的发展、农产品收购价格的提高以及粮食油料和棉花统购的结果，大量货币投放到农村，农民购买力急剧地提高了。如果我们不供给农村更多的商品，不尽可能地满足农民的需要，就会影响他们的生产积极性，就会损害工农之间的联盟，同时农村中大量资金的闲置，也不利于国家的经济建设事业。因此，把工业品首先用来满足农民需要，是一个重大的经济的和政治的任务。
    城市是应该而且也有可能大力支援农村的。几年来城市人民的消费水平都比农村高的多。据济南市的调查，一九五三年全市机关干部每人消费棉布为九四·一九尺，工商资本家为九二·○○尺，工人为六四·八尺，居民为三九·五八尺。而很多地区的农民，在几年来消费水平提高的情况下，每人每年棉布的实际消费量也只不过一二十尺，有的每年只买五尺布，有的只用少量土布，根本不用机织布。如果用上海、北京这样的大城市和农村相比，悬殊更要大些。因此，在适应目前购买力的基础上，少增加城市的消费，多供应农村的需要，是公平合理的。为了支援农民兄弟，城市人民必须用各种办法注意节约棉布的消费。例如城市人民一般地都存有一些衣服，现在还是可以穿的，就应该多穿一些时候，少作一些新衣；就是在缝制新衣的时候，能作旗袍的就作旗袍，能穿裙子的就穿裙子，改变男女老少一律都穿蓝布制服的习惯，也会节约很多布料，并且可以使我们的生活更为丰富多彩。这些办法都是可以采用的和应该采用的。
    就国营商业和私商的关系来说，在关于实行棉花统购和棉布统购统销的命令中，一方面规定了棉花商贩一律不得经营贩运业务，棉布批发商不得继续进行批发业务，并通过经销、代销等方式把棉布零售商贩纳入国家资本主义轨道；另一方面，又规定了棉花商贩及棉布批发商的从业人员，由各级人民政府积极辅导其转业，或在当地人民政府领导下，由中国花纱布公司、供销合作社分别安置。这也就是说，一方面要取缔私商的投机行为，另一方面又负责解决他们的困难，安置他们的工作，并维持棉布零售商的经营。这些措施，进一步贯彻了对私营工商业的利用、限制、改造的政策，完全符合过渡时期总任务的要求。
    总之，棉花统购和棉布统购统销的措施，它牵涉的范围很广，影响人民的生活习惯很大，因此必须进行深入动员，端正认识，通过这项措施，进一步提高干部的政策水平和广大群众的社会主义觉悟。只有这样，才能顺利地贯彻这个政策，进一步鼓舞和发挥全国人民建设社会主义的热情。
