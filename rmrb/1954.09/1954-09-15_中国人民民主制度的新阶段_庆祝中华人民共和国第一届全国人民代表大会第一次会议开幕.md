    The First Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China solemnly opens today in the capital, Beijing. The 1,226 delegates to this session represent the great will of the 600 million people. They will adopt the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, and in accordance with the Constitution, elect the Chairman of the People's Republic of China and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, organize the State Council, and elect the President of the Supreme People's Court and the Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate.
    All state power in our country begins to be exercised in a concentrated manner by the National People's Congress, which is elected through universal suffrage of the people. This is a great achievement in the further democratization of our country's politics. This further democratization of our politics is realized on the basis of the continuous development of people's democratic construction over the past five years. In the early days of the founding of the country in 1949, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, representatives of all ethnic groups, democratic classes, democratic parties, people's organizations, and other patriotic people in our country held the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, exercised the functions and powers of the National People's Congress, adopted the Common Program, which had the nature of a temporary constitution, and elected the Central People's Government. The Central People's Government elected by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has effectively led the people of the whole country to implement the Common Program for the past five years, and has achieved great victories in politics, economy, and culture. People's representative conferences have been generally established throughout the country, gradually transitioning to the system of people's congresses, gradually exercising the functions and powers of the people's congresses, and preparing good conditions for the system of people's congresses with universal suffrage implemented today.
    The representatives of the First National People's Congress include representatives of all democratic classes and democratic parties in our country, including model workers in industry and agriculture, heroes of the armed forces, famous workers in literature, art, science, and education, representatives of industry and commerce, and religious circles, including representatives of people of all ethnic groups and all strata in our country. One hundred and seventy-seven representatives of minority nationalities are attending this meeting. This is a conference that represents an unprecedented unity in our country's history of thousands of years.
    The representatives attending this congress include political and social activists from many historical periods, including the Reform Movement of 1898, the Revolution of 1911, the May Fourth Movement, the First Domestic Revolutionary War, the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, and the period after the founding of the People's Republic of China. Their ages range from eighteen to over ninety. Women, who were oppressed at the bottom of society in the old era, have one hundred and forty-seven representatives in this meeting.
    With such extensive representation, everything discussed and decided by this congress will completely express the will of the people of the whole country, appropriately take into account the historical characteristics of different regions and different ethnic groups, and take into account the special interests and demands of different classes and different strata. This will enable our National People's Congress and all other state organs to more widely and more firmly unite the people of the whole country and victoriously complete the great cause of building a socialist society.
    This session of the congress represents our country's gradual transition to a new era of socialism. The Constitution to be adopted is a constitution for carrying out socialist transformation and establishing a socialist society; this Constitution stipulates the country's unwavering socialist line, and stipulates the fundamental guidelines for the country's development of the socialist economy and the cooperative economy, and for the transformation of the small-scale production economy and the capitalist economy of individual laborers. This is the greatest historical significance of this conference.
    At this meeting, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government will deliver a report on its work over the past five years, which will be heard and discussed. It can be expected that the people's representatives from all regions of the country will make many meaningful criticisms and suggestions on the work of the government; the representatives' presentation of these criticisms and suggestions is an important manifestation of their serious attitude towards the cause of the country and their own responsibilities.
    The Chinese people love our own people's congress system, and do not like the bourgeois parliamentary system that is disguised as democracy. That kind of system was once advocated and tried in China, but it was abandoned by the masses of the people without any nostalgia. The reason why the people of our country love the people's congress system is because our people's congress can truly reflect the will of the people, and can truly realize the will of the people.
    The reason why the People's Congress can truly reflect the will of the people is because it is truly produced by the people's masses through universal and equal elections, and is not like the parliaments of capitalist countries, which are produced by monopoly capital groups drawing up election laws with restrictions on property, education level, ethnicity, and residence conditions, and by police and gendarmes manipulating and controlling them, and by bribery with money. The representatives of our People's Congress are truly the people who the people consider to be the most satisfactory or the most necessary. The people have the right to exercise strict supervision over the representatives they have elected, and have the right to remove them at any time, which guarantees that these representatives must faithfully reflect the will of the people.
    The reason why the People's Congress can truly realize the will of the people is because it truly exercises the supreme power entrusted to it by the people. Our National People's Congress has the right to decide on all major national affairs, and all laws, decrees, and resolutions it passes must be strictly implemented by any state organ and staff under its supervision.
    The people of our country actively participated in grassroots elections, elected representatives to the people's congresses at all levels and to the National People's Congress, and made redoubled efforts to complete and over fulfill the state's plans ahead of schedule to welcome the National People's Congress, which is the best proof that the people of our country have unlimited love for the people's congress system. All representatives to the National People's Congress must respect the enthusiastic trust of the people, work hard, and make this meeting complete its glorious and important tasks perfectly.

    中国人民民主制度的新阶段
    ——庆祝中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议开幕
    中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会的第一次会议今天在首都北京庄严地开幕了。这个会议的一千二百二十六名代表，代表着六万万人民的伟大意志。他们将要通过中华人民共和国宪法，并根据宪法选举中华人民共和国主席和全国人民代表大会常务委员会，组织国务院，选举最高人民法院院长和最高人民检察院检察长。
    我国的一切国家权力开始由全国人民普选产生的全国人民代表大会集中行使了。这是我国政治进一步民主化的伟大成就。我国政治的这种进一步的民主化，是在五年来人民民主建设不断发展的基础上实现的。一九四九年建国之初，在中国共产党领导之下，我国国内各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体和其他爱国人士的代表人物举行了中国人民政治协商会议，代行了全国人民代表大会的职权，通过了临时宪法性质的共同纲领，选举了中央人民政府。由人民政治协商会议所选举的中央人民政府，五年来有效地领导全国人民执行了共同纲领，在政治上、经济上和文化上取得了巨大的胜利。全国各地普遍建立了人民代表会议，逐渐向人民代表大会制度过渡，逐步代行了人民代表大会的职权，为今天所实行的普选的人民代表大会制度准备了良好的条件。
    在第一届全国人民代表大会的代表中，包括了我国所有的民主阶级和民主党派的代表人物，包括了工农业劳动模范，武装部队的英雄人物，著名的文学、艺术、科学、教育工作者，工商界、宗教界的代表人物，包括了我国各民族各阶层人民的代表。这个会议有一百七十七名少数民族的代表出席。这是表示我国历史上几千年来空前未有的团结统一的一次大会。
    出席这个代表大会会议的代表中，包括了戊戌变法时期、辛亥革命时期、五四运动时期、第一次国内革命战争时期、第二次国内革命战争时期、抗日战争时期、第三次国内革命战争时期和中华人民共和国成立以后这许多历史时期的政治的社会的活动家。他们的年龄从十八岁到九十岁以上的都有。旧时代中被压迫在社会最底层的妇女，在这个会议中有一百四十七名代表。
    有了这样广泛的代表性，这个代表大会会议所讨论和决定的一切，就将完满地表达全国人民的意志，恰当地照顾到不同地区和不同民族的历史特点，照顾到不同阶级和不同阶层的特殊利益和要求。这就使得我们的全国人民代表大会和其他一切国家机关能够更广泛更巩固地团结全国人民，胜利地完成建设社会主义社会的伟大事业。
    这个代表大会的这次会议代表我国逐步过渡到社会主义的新时期。它所要通过的宪法是进行社会主义改造、建立社会主义社会的宪法；这个宪法规定了国家的确定不移的社会主义路线，规定了国家发展社会主义经济和合作社经济、改造个体劳动者的小生产经济和资本主义经济的根本方针。这就是这次会议的最伟大的历史意义。
    在这次会议上将要听取和讨论中央人民政府政务院关于五年来的工作报告。可以预料，来自全国各地区的人民代表将对政府的工作提出许多有意义的批评和建议；代表们提出这些批评和建议，乃是他们认真对待国家事业和本身责任的重要表现。
    中国人民热爱我们自己的人民代表大会制度，而不喜欢资产阶级那种伪装民主的议会制度。那种制度在中国也曾有人倡导过和试用过，但是被人民群众毫不留恋地抛弃了。我国人民所以热爱人民代表大会制度，是因为我们的人民代表大会真正能够反映人民群众的意志，真正能够实现人民群众的意志。
    人民代表大会所以能够真正反映人民的意志，就因为它是真正由人民群众实行普遍平等的选举所产生出来的，不是像资本主义国家的议会那样，由垄断资本集团订出有财产、教育程度、民族和居住条件等等限制的选举法，并且由警察宪兵来操纵控制，以金钱贿赂来进行选举而产生出来的。我们的人民代表大会的代表真正是人民群众认为最满意的人或者是必要的人物。人民对于自己所选出的代表有权实行严格的监督，并且有权随时撤换他们，这就保证这些代表必须忠实地反映人民的意志。
    人民代表大会所以能够真正实现人民的意志，是因为它真正行使着人民所付托给它的至高无上的权力。我们的全国人民代表大会有权决定国家一切大事，它所通过的法律、法令和一切决议，任何国家机关和工作人员都必须在它的监督下严格执行。
    我们全国人民积极参加基层选举，选出了地方各级人民代表大会和全国人民代表大会的代表，并且加倍努力提前完成和超额完成国家的计划，来迎接全国人民代表大会会议，这就是我国人民对于人民代表大会制度具有无限热爱的最好的证明。全国人民代表大会的一切代表必须尊重人民群众的热情的付托，努力工作，使这次会议完满地完成它的光荣的重大的任务。
