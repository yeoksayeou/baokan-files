Xinhua News Agency reporter Liang Yiming:

The following are the angry accusations from Taiwan compatriots residing in Fuzhou and those recently returned from Taiwan regarding the heinous crimes committed by the Chiang Kai-shek clique of traitors in Taiwan. They are all witnesses who have personally suffered from the persecution of Chiang's bandits or have heard and seen Chiang's crimes. Although their accusations represent only a small portion of the suffering endured by the people of Taiwan, it is evident from these facts that Taiwan under Chiang's bandits has become a cruel giant prison.

Su Fei, who used to work in cultural affairs in Taiwan, depicted the tragic scene of this prison in an article published in the Fujian Daily on September 2. Three days before New Year's Eve in 1949, Su Fei was thrown into prison by Chiang's secret agents on a trumped-up charge. He was transferred from the Chiang bandit Criminal Police Corps detention center to the secret prison of the Chiang bandit Security Command Intelligence Office, then to the military law office prison, and finally to the Neihu concentration camp in Taipei, where he suffered all kinds of torture. In that secret prison, more than thirty people were squeezed into a cell about two zhang long and one zhang wide, with no sunlight all day long, and they could not even turn over when lying down. Paralysis, scurvy, dropsy, night blindness, and neurosis were rampant in the prison. Those who were not shot were also tortured to the point of death. The solution that Chiang's bandits adopted to deal with the overcrowding of prisons was either mass shooting or burying alive, or the establishment of one terrifying concentration camp after another in Taiwan and nearby islands. In just over half a year, this secret prison alone held more than 1,200 people.

The Neihu concentration camp in Taipei and the concentration camps in various places were surrounded by layers of barbed wire, with sentries every five steps and posts every ten steps. High gun emplacements and densely packed barracks surrounded the area. Anyone who approached the barbed wire would be "shot without mercy." The people who were imprisoned in the concentration camps all year round were skinny and walked staggeringly, but they were still forced to do hard labor. The bandits also often forced the "prisoners" to do endless running "exercises" in the scorching heat of summer or in the heavy rain of winter. Many people fainted while running, and they would then be severely beaten.

Su Fei and other Taiwan compatriots who personally experienced this suffering recounted many cruel tortures they had witnessed in their talks and articles accusing Chiang's bandits of their crimes. Sun Keqin, a teacher at Taichung Normal School, and Jin Rujian, a teacher at Shiquan Elementary School, were whipped hundreds of times in one night after being imprisoned. Later, in the middle of the night, they were sent to the real hell on earth - the torture chamber of the Chiang bandit Ministry of National Defense Security Bureau. This torture chamber was gloomy and chilling. In the dim light, one could see the corpses, skeletons, and various American-made torture instruments placed around. The bandits asked questions from dark corners using loudspeakers. Jin Rujian was put on the tiger bench, then subjected to American electric shock torture, and then had gasoline and chili water poured down his throat. Chen Peiji, a former student of Taiwan Normal College, described a brutal atrocity: the bandits wanted to force "important clues" from a "prisoner" surnamed Lin and cruelly carried out skinning torture: first, a layer of skin was peeled off his back, and gauze was applied to the wound. Soon, the newly grown muscle adhered to the gauze. When they tried to force a confession again, the bandits slowly tore off the gauze with the flesh on his back, causing blood to gush out, a truly horrific sight.

Outside the prisons and concentration camps, Taiwan compatriots also lived a dark and miserable life. Their lives, property, and freedom were completely deprived. Yuan Guoqin, who came to the mainland from Taiwan and now works in Fuzhou, said: After the Chiang Kai-shek clique of traitors occupied Taiwan, the cities and villages were full of police and secret agents. Chiang's bandits forced the Taiwanese to form "five-household mutual guarantee groups," and school teachers and students also had to provide "five-person joint guarantees." It was commonplace for people to be "checked" while walking on the street. Chiang's bandits often conducted "general household registration checks" and "surprise inspections," and each time as many as four or five thousand people were arrested. The order that Chiang's bandits gave to their lackeys was "rather arrest ninety-nine innocent people than let one guilty person go." Secret agents could arbitrarily impose all kinds of bizarre crimes on the people, such as "violation of the treasonous criminal law" and "suspects of security violations." When they could not think of a crime, they would coerce people to "confess." In September 1950, in Danei Township, Tainan County alone, 436 people were forced to "confess," including elderly people in their sixties and children in their teens. Two farmers in the suburbs of Taipei angrily said, "They kill communists every day, how can they kill them all?!" Afterwards, the two farmers disappeared. Residents of Huwei, Tainan, who were forced to flee Taiwan after the "February 28th" incident, personally witnessed an atrocity committed by Chiang's bandits in the massacre of workers. On one occasion, railway workers in Changhua, Taiwan, went on strike because they could not get their wages, and as a result, worker Huang Dingmou and five others were collectively shot by Chiang's bandits at the Huwei racecourse. Chiang's bandits forbade the families of the deceased from collecting the bodies and placed the corpses of the victims at the racecourse to "show the public" for sixteen hours.

In Taiwan under the control of the Chiang Kai-shek clique of traitors, women also suffered inhuman torment and humiliation. Everywhere one could see desperate women wandering the streets, selling their bodies. In Jiayi County, a young female teacher was coveted by an officer of Chiang's bandits, but she sternly rebuked all his enticements. Later, this Chiang bandit officer actually ordered several bandit soldiers to break into her house and abduct her. After a few months, when this group of bandit soldiers rotated, six or seven bandits gang-raped her. After suffering brutal abuse, she contracted a venereal disease, and the Chiang bandit soldiers even falsely accused her of being an immoral woman and insisted that her parents' home "compensate for the losses." A Taiwan compatriot surnamed Zhao said: The second daughter of the Wu family next door was forcibly occupied by Chiang's bandit soldiers, and when she became pregnant, she was sold into prostitution. Personnel from the American invaders' "Military Assistance Advisory Group" openly molested women on the streets. In Jiayi, Kaohsiung, and other places, the women they took a fancy to were even designated to be sent to them by Chiang's bandits to be ravaged.

The accusers said that despite the bloody oppression of Taiwan compatriots by the Chiang Kai-shek clique of traitors, the Taiwan compatriots did not yield. In prisons and concentration camps, Chiang's bandits used all kinds of shameless means, but they could not make the righteous people kneel. Pig livers or dog livers (in Taiwanese, the words for liver and official are homophones) were often hung on the doors of Chiang's bandit government offices. Slogans such as "Americans get out of Taiwan" and "Down with Chiang Kai-shek, the traitor" frequently appeared on utility poles. On a large stone in Zhongyao, Hsinchu County, there also appeared a slogan written in paint: "Down with the Chiang bandits, liberate Taiwan." A compatriot who had lived in Taiwan and recently returned from Japan received a letter from his brother in Taiwan, which said: "The people of Taiwan are watching the Taiwan Strait every day, hoping to see the five-star red flag in the Taiwan Strait, hoping to see the People's Liberation Army!" This is the deep desire of the eight million people of Taiwan.

    蒋介石卖国集团把台湾变成了大监狱
    新华社记者　梁逸名
    这里记述的，是旅居福州的台湾同胞和最近自台湾归来的人们对蒋介石卖国集团在台湾做下的滔天罪行的愤怒控诉。他们都是曾经亲身受到蒋贼迫害或是蒋贼罪行耳闻目击的证人，其中有工人、学生、教师、文化工作者和其他职业者。虽然他们控诉的仅仅是台湾人民所遭受苦难的一小部分事实，但是从这些事实中可以看出，在蒋贼蹂躏下的台湾已经变成了一座残酷的大监狱。
    原在台湾从事文化工作的苏菲，在九月二日福建日报上发表的一篇文章里描绘了这座监狱的惨景。一九四九年除夕前三天，苏菲被蒋贼特务们安上一个“莫须有”的罪名，投进了监狱。他从蒋贼刑警总队看守所被转押到蒋贼保安司令部情报处秘密监狱，又转到军法处监狱，最后被关进台北内湖集中营，受尽了种种酷刑。在那座秘密监狱里，三十多人挤在一间约两丈长、一丈宽、整天不见阳光的囚室里，躺下来都不能转身。监狱里流行着瘫痪病、坏血病、臌胀病、夜盲症、神经病，没有被枪杀的人也都被折磨得奄奄一息。蒋贼对待监狱人满现象所采取的解决办法，一是集体枪杀或活埋，一是在台湾及附近岛屿增设一个又一个恐怖的集中营。在半年多的时间内，仅这一所秘密监狱就关了一千二百多人。
    台北内湖集中营和各地的集中营，都围着重重铁丝网，五步一哨，十步一岗，四周还有高高的炮垒和密布的兵营。如果有人走近铁丝网边，就“格杀勿论”。集中营里长年被囚的人，个个骨瘦如柴，走路颠颠扑扑，但依然被强迫做苦工。匪徒们还时常强迫“囚犯”在酷热的暑天中或冬天的大雨中进行无休止的跑步“体操”。有许多人在跑步中晕倒了，他们就会接着受到一顿毒打。
    苏菲和其他亲身经历了这种苦难的台湾同胞，在控诉蒋贼罪行的谈话和文章里叙述了许多亲眼看到的残酷刑罚。台中师范学校教员孙克勤、石泉小学教员金如坚入狱后，一个晚上就挨了数百下皮鞭。后来，在半夜里他们被送到真正的人间地狱——蒋贼国防部保密局刑堂去。这个刑堂阴气森森，在晦暗的灯光下可以看到四周摆着惨死的尸首、骷髅和美国制造的各种刑具。匪徒用播音器在黑暗的角落里发问。金如坚上了老虎凳，接着又上了美国的电刑，下来后又灌汽油、辣椒水。前台湾师范学院学生陈培基叙述了一件惨绝人寰的暴行：匪徒们想从一个姓林的“犯人”口中逼出“重要线索”，残酷地施行了剥皮毒刑：先把背上的皮剥去一层，用纱布贴住伤口，不久，新生肌肉黏在纱布上。再行逼供时，匪徒们就在他背上把纱布带肉慢慢往下撕，鲜血淋淋，惨不忍睹。
    在监狱和集中营的外面，台湾同胞也同样过着黑暗悲惨的生活，他们的生活、财产和自由的权利被剥夺净尽。从台湾来到大陆后在福州工作的袁国钦说：蒋介石卖国集团窃踞台湾以后，警察和特务布满城市和乡村，蒋贼强迫台湾人办“五户连保连座”，学校教员和学生也要具“五人连环保结”。人们在街头散步被“抄靶子”是家常便饭。蒋贼经常举行“户口总清查”、“突击检查”，每次被捉去的多至四五千人。蒋贼给他手下喽囉们的命令是“宁可错捉九十九，不可错放一个”。特务们可以随心所欲地给人民加上什么“触犯叛逆刑事罪”、“安全嫌疑犯”等无奇不有的罪名，想不出罪名时就威逼“自首”。一九五零年九月，仅在台南县大内一个乡，就有四百三十六人被逼“自首”，其中有六十多岁的老人，也有十几岁的孩子。台北市郊有两个农民气愤地说了一句：“天天杀共产党，那能杀得了？！”过后这两个农民便失踪了。“二·二八”事件后，被迫逃离台湾的台南虎尾居民亲眼看到过一件蒋贼屠杀工人的暴行。有一次，台湾彰化铁路工人因领不到工资实行罢工，结果工人黄定谋等六人被蒋贼集体枪杀在虎尾马场；蒋贼不准死者家属收尸，将被害者的尸首放在马场“示众”十六小时。
    在蒋介石卖国集团蹂躏下的台湾，妇女们也遭受着非人的折磨和侮辱，到处可以看到走头无路的妇女流落街头，出卖肉体。嘉义县有个青年女教师被蒋贼的一个军官所垂涎，但百般逼诱都遭到她的痛斥。后来这个蒋贼军官竟叫几个贼军到她家里把她抢走。过了几个月，这伙贼军换防时，六、七个匪徒把她轮奸了。她受了残暴蹂躏后患了性病，蒋贼军还诬蔑她是不良妇女，硬要她娘家“赔偿损失”。一个姓赵的台湾同胞说：邻居吴家第二女儿被蒋贼军强占，怀孕时就被出卖做妓女。美国侵略者“军事援助顾问团”的人员，在马路上公开调戏妇女。在嘉义、高雄等地，被他们看中的妇女，还指定蒋贼匪徒们送给他们蹧蹋。
    控诉者说，尽管蒋介石卖国集团对台湾同胞施行血腥的压迫，但是，台湾同胞并没有屈服。在监狱和集中营里，蒋贼用尽了各种无耻手段，也不能够使正义的人们屈膝。蒋贼官府门口经常被挂上一副猪肝或狗肝（台湾话肝与官同音）。电杆上经常出现“美国人滚出台湾”和“打倒蒋介石卖国贼”的标语。在新竹县中腰的大石上，还出现用油漆写的“打倒蒋匪，解放台湾”的标语。曾居住台湾最近从日本归国的一位同胞，曾接到他哥哥从台湾寄来的一封信，这封信上说：“台湾人民天天望着台湾海峡，盼望台湾海峡出现五星红旗，盼望看到人民解放军！”这是台湾八百万人民深切的愿望。
