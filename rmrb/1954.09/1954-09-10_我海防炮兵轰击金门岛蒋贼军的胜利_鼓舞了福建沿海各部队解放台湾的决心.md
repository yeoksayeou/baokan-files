Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 8th - The good news of our coastal artillery severely striking the Chiang bandit troops on Greater and Lesser Jinmen Islands, upon reaching the People's Liberation Army units stationed on the Fujian coast, who are vigilantly guarding the coastal defense line day and night, filled the commanders and soldiers with joy, further strengthening their confidence and determination to liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. Huang Xianghe, Deputy Director of the Political Department of a certain regiment and recipient of the "First-Class People's Hero" Medal of East China, excitedly said: "We must better strengthen the political and military training of our troops and fight to the end for the victorious liberation of Taiwan and the defense of our socialist construction." Platoon Leader Ji Ruixuan, who was awarded first-class merit in a certain reconnaissance unit that crossed the sea to attack the Chiang bandit troops on Jinmen Island on August 23, and Reconnaissance Soldier Shi Yuxiang, who was awarded second-class merit, jumped up excitedly upon seeing the good news. They said: "We must continue to carry forward our spirit of bravery and continue to improve our combat skills to ensure that we undertake even more important tasks in the struggle to liberate Jinmen and Taiwan." Upon seeing the good news, sailors of a certain naval unit unanimously expressed: "We must better master navigation technology, overcome difficulties, and victoriously complete all the tasks assigned to us by our superiors, and respond to the call of the people of the motherland to liberate Taiwan with practical actions." Cadres and soldiers of a certain coastal artillery battalion of the Navy, who have cooperated with fraternal units to sink three Chiang bandit landing craft and damage one Chiang bandit landing ship in the past three years, also cheered the victory of the fraternal artillery units. Zhang Jiwen, the political instructor of the battalion, said: "We must learn from the fraternal artillery units, strengthen training, and be ready to severely strike the Chiang bandit troops at any time and fight for the security of the motherland and world peace."
	The commanders and soldiers of a certain anti-aircraft unit guarding Xiamen Island, a front-line outpost on the coast, after hearing the broadcast of the bombardment of Jinmen on the morning of the 4th, suddenly received a report that four Chiang bandit planes were coming to harass them. Everyone said angrily: "We must learn from the example of the coastal artillery, severely strike the Chiang bandit planes, and offer a congratulatory gift to the artillery units." Under their fierce and accurate shooting, one Chiang bandit plane was shot down and another was damaged on the spot, and the other two Chiang bandit planes quickly turned around and fled.

    鼓舞了福建沿海各部队解放台湾的决心
    【新华社福州八日电】我海防炮兵痛击大、小金门岛蒋贼军的捷报传到福建沿海各地后，日夜警惕地警卫在海防线上的人民解放军各部队指挥员、战斗员都欢欣鼓舞，更加增强了解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团的信心和决心。华东一级人民英雄奖章获得者、某团政治处副主任黄相和兴奋地说：“我们一定要更好地加强部队政治、军事训练，为胜利解放台湾、保卫祖国社会主义建设而奋斗到底。”在八月二十三日越海袭击金门岛蒋贼军的某侦察部队中荣立一等功的排长纪瑞瑄和荣立二等功的侦察员石玉祥，看到捷报后兴奋得跳起来，他们说：我们一定要继续发扬勇敢精神，继续提高战斗技术，保证在解放金门、台湾的斗争中担负更重大的任务。海军某部的水兵们看到捷报后，一致表示：我们一定要更好地掌握航海技术，克服困难，胜利完成上级交给我们的一切任务，用实际行动来响应祖国人民解放台湾的号召。在最近三年中，曾经配合兄弟部队击沉蒋贼登陆艇三艘、击伤蒋贼登陆舰一艘的海军海岸炮兵某营的干部、战士们，也欢呼兄弟炮兵部队的胜利，营政治教导员张纪文说：“我们一定要向兄弟炮兵部队学习，加强训练，随时准备痛击蒋贼军，为保卫祖国的安全和世界和平而奋斗。”
    警卫在海防前哨厦门岛上的防空部队某部指挥员、战斗员在四日早晨听到了轰击金门的广播后，突然接到有四架蒋贼飞机来骚扰的报告，大家都激愤地说：我们要学习海防炮兵的榜样，痛击蒋贼飞机，给炮兵部队作贺礼。在他们猛烈、准确地射击下，当场就打落和打伤了蒋贼飞机各一架，另两架蒋贼飞机连忙掉头逃跑了。
