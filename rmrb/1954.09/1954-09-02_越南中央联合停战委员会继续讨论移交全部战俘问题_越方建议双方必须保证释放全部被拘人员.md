Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, North Vietnam, August 31st: The Vietnam Central Joint Ceasefire Commission continued discussions on the transfer of all prisoners of war at its meetings on August 26th and 27th.

    At the meeting of the Prisoner of War Sub-Committee on August 26th, the representative of the Vietnam People's Army raised two issues for discussion: the issue of the transfer deadline and the issue of both sides guaranteeing the release of all prisoners of war. The representative of the French Union Forces was single-mindedly focused on setting an unrealistic deadline and an unrealistic number of prisoners of war to be released, while being unwilling to discuss the second issue.

    At the plenary meeting of the Central Joint Ceasefire Commission on August 27th, the delegation of the Vietnam People's Army presented the delegation of the French Union Forces with specific documents proving that the names of many prisoners of war were not included on the prisoner of war list submitted by the delegation of the French Union Forces. The delegation of the Vietnam People's Army also proposed that both sides exchange lists of prisoners of war discovered after a new verification process, so that all detainees on both sides could be released. However, the delegation of the French Union Forces only talked about the weather, using it as an excuse to justify the delay in the transfer work at Viet Tri from August 21st to 23rd. Regarding the issue of transferring all detainees, the delegation of the French Union Forces continued to refuse to discuss it.

    Due to the attitude of the delegation of the French Union Forces, the meeting was unable to reach any concrete agreement.

Xinhua News Agency, August 31st: The Vietnam People's Army is continuing to work hard to overcome difficulties and strive to complete the transfer of French prisoners of war within the stipulated time limit.

    The Vietnam People's Army has taken the initiative to conduct new verification of French prisoners of war and handed over newly discovered prisoners of war to the French Union Forces.

    In Viet Tri, the Vietnam People's Army transferred a total of fifty-three newly discovered prisoners of war on August 28th and 29th, including one colonel and twenty other officers. The Vietnam People's Army also allowed French helicopters to land in Tuyen Quang to receive 337 sick and wounded prisoners of war, including thirty-two officers.

    In岑山 [Cén shān], one hundred and sixty-four previously undiscovered prisoners of war were also transferred after being identified. In addition, ninety prisoners of war will be transferred, including two captains, seven lieutenants, and three second lieutenants.

    In the Fifth Interzone, the Vietnam People's Army has notified the French Union Forces that, after a new verification, another four hundred and two prisoners of war have been discovered, including Colonel Baru, the commander of the 100th Mobile Group who fought in Korea, and five American aircraft pilots.

    越南中央联合停战委员会继续讨论移交全部战俘问题
    越方建议双方必须保证释放全部被拘人员
   【新华社一日讯】据越南通讯社北越八月三十一日讯：越南中央联合停战委员会在八月二十六日和二十七日的会议上，继续讨论移交全部战俘问题。
    在研究战俘问题的小组委员会二十六日的会议上，越南人民军方面的代表提出了两个问题来讨论：移交的期限问题和双方保证释放全部战俘的问题。法兰西联邦部队方面的代表，对于第一个问题一心想订出一个不切实际的期限和不切实际的要释放的战俘数目，而对于第二个问题却不想加以讨论。
    在二十七日中央联合停战委员会的全体会议上，越南人民军代表团向法兰西联邦部队代表团提出了一些具体的文件，证明有许多战俘的姓名并没有被列入法兰西联邦部队代表团所交来的战俘名单上。越南人民军代表团还提议双方交换在进行新的查核以后所发现的战俘的名单，以便使双方全部被拘人员都被释放。但是，法兰西联邦部队代表团只谈天气问题，并以天气为借口来为八月二十一日到二十三日在越池的移交工作被拖延一事作辩解。关于移交全部被拘人员的问题，法兰西联邦部队代表团仍拒绝讨论。
    由于法兰西联邦部队代表团的这种态度，会议无法达成任何具体协议。
    【新华社三十一日讯】据越南通讯社北越三十一日讯：越南人民军方面正继续努力克服困难，争取在规定的期限内，完成移交法方战俘的工作。
    越南人民军方面主动地对法方战俘进行了新的查对，并把查对后新发现的战俘交给法兰西联邦部队。
    在越池，越南人民军方面在八月二十八日和二十九日一共移交了五十三名新发现的战俘，其中有一名上校和二十名其他军官。越南人民军并且还允许法国的直升飞机在宣光着陆，以接收包括三十二名军官在内的三百三十七名病伤战俘。
    在岑山，有一百六十四名早先未被发现的战俘，在查出后也被移交了。此外，还有九十名战俘将予移交，其中有两名上尉，七名中尉和三名少尉。
    在第五联区，越南人民军已通知法兰西联邦部队说，在进行新的查对后，又发现了四百零二名战俘，其中包括曾在朝鲜作战的第一百机动团团长巴鲁上校和五名美国飞机驾驶员。
