    Fushun City Severely Punishes Counter-Revolutionaries Sabotaging Economic Construction
    The Fushun City People's Court recently sentenced the counter-revolutionary element Gu Wenbin, who sabotaged economic construction, to fifteen years in prison, with deprivation of political rights for twenty years.
    During the period of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit rule, Gu Wenbin participated in the pseudo-Three People's Principles Youth League, served as a member of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit secret service work team, and served as secretary of a Kuomintang district branch, consistently engaging in counter-revolutionary activities. After liberation, Gu resisted registration, concealed his counter-revolutionary crimes, and in 1953, he sneaked into the cadre school of the Central Fuel Industry Department to study. After his past counter-revolutionary activities were discovered, he still did not thoroughly confess. In December 1953, after Gu graduated from the cadre school of the Central Fuel Industry Department, he was assigned to the Fushun Mining Bureau Drilling Company. In his work, Gu used his position as a drilling rig recorder to deliberately sabotage basic construction. Within more than two months, Gu maliciously reversed the placement of rock cores extracted from underground three times in a row. During the same period, he also deliberately wrote the "core ticket" incorrectly twice and falsely reported drilling footage, causing geological personnel to misunderstand the rock strata. All these criminal acts were an attempt to deceive and distort the true geological situation, so that construction personnel would rely on incorrect geological data, causing serious technical errors in coal mine construction.
    During the interrogation, Gu Wenbin, faced with conclusive evidence, admitted all of his criminal acts. The Fushun City People's Court, in a public trial, sentenced Gu Wenbin to fifteen years in prison on the spot and deprived him of political rights for twenty years. The people who attended the trial unanimously expressed their support for the verdict and expressed that they would heighten their vigilance, strengthen economic security work, and ensure the smooth progress of socialist construction.

    抚顺市严惩破坏经济建设的反革命分子
    抚顺市人民法院最近判处破坏经济建设的反革命分子顾文斌徒刑十五年，剥夺政治权利二十年。
    顾文斌在蒋匪统治时期参加过伪三青团，充当蒋匪特务工作队队员，并担任过国民党区分部书记，一贯进行反革命活动。解放以后，顾犯抗拒登记，隐瞒反革命罪恶，并于一九五三年混进了中央燃料工业部干部学校学习。他在过去的反革命活动事实被发觉后，仍不彻底坦白。一九五三年十二月，顾犯在中央燃料工业部干部学校毕业后，被分配到抚顺矿务局钻探公司，顾犯在工作中，利用他担任钻机记录员的职务，故意破坏基本建设。顾犯在两个多月内，连续三次把地下取出的岩芯恶意地颠倒安放。在同一时期内，他又故意写错“岩芯票”两次，并假报钻探进尺，使地质人员对岩层的认识发生误解。所有这些犯罪行为是企图蒙蔽和歪曲真实的地质情况，使建设人员以不正确的地质资料为根据，造成煤矿建设上的严重技术错误。
    在审讯过程中，顾犯文斌在确凿的证据面前，承认了自己全部的犯罪行为。抚顺市人民法院在公判庭上当场判决顾犯文斌十五年徒刑，并剥夺政治权利二十年。出席旁听的人民群众一致对这个判决表示拥护，并表示要提高警惕，加强经济保卫工作，保证社会主义建设的顺利进行。
