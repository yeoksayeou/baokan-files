Comrade Khrushchev, Head of the Soviet Government Delegation, Speaks at the Airport

Dear friends:

The Soviet Government Delegation, on the occasion of the grand celebration of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, has come to Beijing, the ancient capital of great China, to extend our heartfelt congratulations to the fraternal Chinese people on behalf of the Soviet people.

The fraternal alliance and unbreakable friendship, fruitful cooperation, and mutual assistance between our two peoples have been established and are being increasingly consolidated in the cause of building a new life and in the struggle for peace.

The Soviet people are deeply concerned about your creative work and congratulate the Chinese working people with great pride on the remarkable achievements they have made under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party and the People's Government. These historical achievements of the people's revolution have been enshrined in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, recently adopted by the National People's Congress, which solemnly proclaims the principles of building a socialist society in China. We warmly congratulate the Chinese people on the adoption of the Constitution and the election of Comrade Mao Zedong, the great son and leader of the Chinese people, as the Chairman of the People's Republic of China.

The victory of the Chinese People's Revolution and the great achievements in peaceful construction demonstrate the unparalleled strength of the 600 million Chinese people who have taken their destiny into their own hands and are determined to carry out great reforms within the country to achieve their set goals.

All peace-loving people in the world believe that the unbreakable friendship between the two great powers, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, is a strong fortress of peace, a great invincible force that has a growing influence on resolving all international issues for the benefit of all mankind and for the consolidation of world peace.

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the great Chinese people and the glorious Communist Party of China!

May the eternal friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China grow and strengthen!
