    Learning Culture, Improving Production
    ——Five Years of Workers' and Peasants' Spare-Time Cultural Education
    Huangfu Jin
    In Order to Escape the State of Illiteracy
    New China has brought an increasingly rich cultural life to the working people. Today, whether in factories, mines, large and small towns, the vast countryside, remote areas of the motherland, or the vast grasslands, tens of thousands of working people are happily and intently studying culture in their spare time. The government and mass organizations have established a large number of workers' and peasants' spare-time schools, while also adopting a variety of learning methods, such as factory "workshop schools," coal mine "pithead study groups," rural "field study groups," women's "bedside study groups," transport team "cart team study groups," and the recently emerged "agricultural production cooperative-run schools," striving to organize more people who urgently need to learn culture into "their own schools." Existing statistics tell us that in 1953, 2.58 million workers and staff and more than 12.3 million peasants participated in year-round spare-time learning; 19.39 million peasants participated in winter schools; and in areas inhabited by ethnic minorities such as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Xinjiang, Yanbian in Jilin, and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the number of people of all ethnic minorities participating in workers' and peasants' spare-time schools is also increasing daily.
    In the old society, the working people suffered the oppression and exploitation of landlords and capitalists. They were deprived of the right to education and were long in a state of ignorance and illiteracy. Today, the liberated working people deeply feel how illiteracy affects their political progress and the improvement of production technology, so they are eager to escape the state of illiteracy. Comrades, masters and apprentices, husbands and wives, fathers and sons encourage each other to study hard in daily life. Many workers' and peasants' families have participated in cultural learning together, and they have written "striving to learn culture" into their patriotic covenants. The cultural life of factories and rural areas has become more fulfilling as the number of literate people increases. A significant feature is that newspapers and books have become indispensable to the lives of workers and peasants, and mass-based library services have developed. Agricultural production cooperatives generally subscribe to newspapers. The four production teams of the Han'en Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, each have a copy of "New Countryside" and "Agricultural Technology," and the cooperative also subscribes to "People's Daily," "Northeast Daily," and "Jilin Daily." Reading groups, clubs, amateur theater groups, and singing teams are more active in factories and rural areas.
    Studying Hard and Practicing Diligently
    In learning culture, thousands of workers and peasants have displayed the spirit of studying hard and practicing diligently. Shen Jilan, the nationally renowned labor model and deputy director of the Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative, works during the day, works at night, has to cook at home, and sometimes has to go out to meetings. People say that she is so busy that it is difficult to persist in learning. However, her own ideas are different from everyone else's. She deeply feels that the difficulties of being uncultured are even greater. During her attendance at the World Women's Congress, because she was not cultured, she could not record and convey what she heard and saw abroad in writing, and she felt annoyed. She felt sorry for the sisters of the motherland! She made up her mind to learn culture well. Her main difficulty is being "busy," and her way to overcome this difficulty is to "squeeze" time. Every day, whether working or attending meetings, she carries books and pens with her, and studies whenever she has time. She studies during the few minutes of rest in the fields, and she also takes out books to study while waiting for people at meetings. In order to practice her ability to take notes, she takes a few notes whenever possible during meetings. When she goes out to meetings, she always asks the teacher for lessons and always hands in homework when she returns. After participating in some important meetings and political activities, she practices writing her feelings, and asks others if she doesn't know how to write something. In this way, she went from not being able to sign her name to recognizing 1,500 characters, being able to read newspapers and "North China People" magazine, and being able to write articles of 300 to 500 words. There are many, many such examples. In the past few years, in workers' and peasants' spare-time education, tens of thousands of learning models have emerged. They have summarized their learning methods in various aspects, but in summary, it is these four words: study hard and practice diligently.
    Because the workers and peasants deeply feel the pain of being uncultured, they not only study hard and practice diligently in their studies, but also highly display the spirit of mutual assistance and love. "Teaching each other and learning from each other" has become one of the characteristics of China's mass-based workers' and peasants' spare-time cultural education. The vast majority of teachers in workers' and peasants' spare-time schools come from workers and peasants, and many are graduates of "literacy classes." Among them, tens of thousands of model mass teachers have emerged. These mass teachers generally have an excellent work style of close ties with the masses. Some mass teachers do not have a high level of culture themselves, so they work hard to study business, learning and teaching at the same time; some mass teachers are able to connect with reality and create many teaching methods suitable for adult learning. Their common wish is to wholeheartedly serve the cultural emancipation of workers and peasants. Ren Fenghua, a model teacher from northern Shaanxi, said: His only purpose is to enable the masses to "learn characters without spending money, without delaying work." With the working spirit of "sincerity," "trust," and "perseverance," he has persisted in mass spare-time cultural education for nearly twenty years.
    The First Letter Written to Chairman Mao
    As a result of the literacy campaigns carried out over the past few years, the first batch of factories that have basically eliminated illiteracy have emerged: Changchun Xinhua Printing Factory, Beijing People's Printing Factory, Fushun Open-Pit Coal Mine North Electromechanical Plant, Shijingshan Power Plant... In these factories, the library is always crowded during break times. The workers and staff of the Changchun Xinhua Printing Factory have subscribed to 195 newspapers themselves, and most of the workers and staff can write for the blackboard newspapers or newspapers.
    Many "cultural villages" have emerged in rural areas. The Peasants' Spare-Time School in Zhengyi Village, Yushu County, Jilin Province, has persisted for six or seven years. This village, which was originally poor and had few literate people, now has a rural library, has established a peasants' amateur theater troupe, and has also organized a peasants' literary creation group. In the past year, the peasants have created two or three hundred literary works, some of which have been published in publications.
    Of course, factories and villages that have completely eliminated illiteracy are not too many at present, but the number of illiterates eliminated nationwide is increasing year by year. As of 1953, nearly one million illiterates had been eliminated among workers and staff, and 3.08 million illiterates had been eliminated among peasants in 1953. Many graduates of "literacy classes" have been promoted to advanced classes (groups), spare-time middle school classes, or spare-time technical schools of spare-time schools to continue to improve their cultural, political, and technical levels. Many workers and staff who have graduated from spare-time advanced classes or middle school classes have been selected to attend worker-peasant rapid middle schools or universities for further study. In the past, workers and peasants who were illiterate were truly "drawing black lines on white paper, the more they looked, the more annoyed they became." Now that they have opened their illiterate eyes, they can read books and newspapers, and they can also write letters and articles. It is conceivable how happy they are! Many workers and peasants enthusiastically send their first letters, written by themselves, to the beloved Chairman Mao, expressing their unspeakable gratitude to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.
    After Political and Cultural Levels Improve
    Workers' and peasants' spare-time schools are also important places for conducting political and ideological education and effective propaganda fronts for the Party's various policies. In the past few years, various political movements and central tasks have generally been explained and discussed in spare-time schools, which has improved the political consciousness of workers and peasants on the one hand, and promoted the development of the movement on the other hand. With the improvement of political consciousness and cultural level, the production enthusiasm and creativity of workers and peasants have also been greatly improved. Cultural learning has played a great role in workers' finding tricks, tapping potential, proposing rationalization proposals, and improving technology. Li Lanhua, a worker at the Jin Sheng Textile Factory in Shanxi, could originally only watch 200 spindles. After improving her cultural level, she worked hard to study the Hao Jianxiu work method, and can now watch 400 spindles. Wang Hongzhi, a fitter at the Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory, understood the principle that "the smaller the contact area of an object, the greater the pressure it receives" during his studies, improved his tools, increased productivity fivefold, and saved a lot of materials. Luo Deyun is an old model worker with more than 30 years of experience in the Jiang'an Engineering Section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway. After studying, he understood many scientific principles. He read the story of Zhan Tianyou and was inspired to design a screw bed. Because he had learned arithmetic, he was able to design, draft, and calculate, and was able to write notes to help him remember, so he imitated the screw bed and increased productivity sevenfold. In addition, he imitated a wood planer, which can increase productivity twentyfold. Many outstanding workers have been promoted to production management cadres and leading cadres after improving their cultural level. For example, 121 students of the Workers' and Staff Spare-Time School of the Tianjin Cotton Spinning Factory have been promoted to wage officers, accountants, measurement officers, and statisticians. In Lanzhou, twelve workers have become factory directors or deputy factory directors. These cadres of worker origin have maintained the excellent work style of the working class in their respective work positions and have played a great role in their work.
    The role of winter schools and people's schools in rural areas in conducting socialist education for peasants is very significant. For example, after land reform in Juzhai Village, Changzhi, Shanxi, with the improvement of their lives, the peasants developed a spontaneous tendency toward capitalism; some cadres relaxed their leadership over mutual assistance and cooperation, causing such class differentiation in the village: three peasant households developed to the point of hiring long-term workers, and fifteen peasant households sold their land and houses. At that time, the Party branch relied on the people's school to conduct socialist education for the peasants and cultivated model mutual aid groups. After more than a year of repeated education, the spontaneous tendency of capitalism among cadres and peasants was reversed. In 1951, the number of organized peasant households reached 85% of the total number of peasant households in the village, and the following year, a large number of mutual aid groups were transformed into agricultural production cooperatives. At this time, the happy life of Soviet collective farms was publicized in the people's school, which greatly encouraged the peasants' confidence and determination to take the road of collectivization. A quick board song they wrote themselves reflected this mood: "It is better to work together than to work alone, the cooperative is even higher than the group, if you want a more fulfilling life, the collective farm is the goal."
    Learning culture has opened the door for peasants to accept scientific principles. It has prepared good conditions for them to improve their production technology. Many peasants in Zhengyi Village, Yushu County, Jilin Province, understand the elements of fertilizer—nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium—and know which fertilizer is suitable for which soil. The village's agricultural technology research group often reads "Agricultural Technology" and other books and newspapers. They have absorbed the experience of high yield in Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang, in production, promoted the cultivation method of "equal-distance wide sowing," and corrected the idea of "increasing production to the top." Therefore, Zhengyi Village has a bumper harvest every year. In the past, promoting new agricultural tools in rural areas encountered many difficulties. For example, the walking plow is a very good new agricultural tool, but after some villages bought it, because no one could understand the instructions for use, they could not use it, so they had to hang it on the wall, becoming a "hanging plow." Now the "hanging plows" are all on the ground.
    The publicity of the state's general task in the transition period and the gradual development of the national economy have created more favorable conditions for the development of workers' and peasants' spare-time education: the socialist consciousness of workers and peasants has been further improved, their lives are improving day by day, they have felt that in order to build a socialist society, they must improve their cultural level, so the learning requirements are more urgent, and the ranks of mass teachers have been unprecedentedly strengthened after a large number of graduates of higher primary schools and junior middle schools engaged in labor production. It is believable that under the brilliant light of the general task, the cause of workers' and peasants' spare-time cultural education in our country will surely have greater development in the future.

    学习文化，提高生产
    ——五年来的工农业余文化教育
    皇甫瑾
    为了摆脱没有文化的状态
    新中国给劳动人民带来了日益丰富的文化生活。今天，无论在工厂，在矿山，在大小城镇，在广大农村，在祖国的边远地区和辽阔的草原上，成千上万的劳动人民在生产和工作之余，愉快而紧张地学习着文化。政府和群众团体开办了大量的工农业余学校，同时采取了多种多样的学习方式，如工厂的“车间学校”，煤矿的“坑口学习小组”，农村的“地头学习小组”，妇女的“炕头学习小组”，运输队的“大车队学习小组”，以及近来出现的“农业生产合作社办学”等，努力把更多的迫切要求学习文化的人，组织到“自己的学校”里来。现有的统计数字告诉我们，一九五三年已有二百五十八万职工、一千二百三十多万农民参加了常年业余学习；农民参加冬学的有一千九百三十九万人；在内蒙古自治区、新疆、吉林延边地区、广西僮族自治区等少数民族聚居的地区，各少数民族人民参加工农业余学校学习的人数也在日见增加。
    在旧社会里，劳动人民受着地主、资本家的压迫和剥削。被剥夺了受教育的权利，长期处于愚昧和没文化状态。今天，解放了的劳动人民，深深地感到不识字会怎样地影响自己政治上的进步和生产技术的提高，因此他们渴望摆脱没文化的状态。同志之间、师徒之间、夫妻之间、父子之间在日常生活中都以努力学习互相勉励。许多工人和农民的家庭全家参加了文化学习，他们把“努力学习文化”写入了爱国公约。工厂和农村的文化生活随着识字人数的增加而更加充实。显著的特点是：书报开始成了工人和农民生活中不可缺少的东西，群众性的图书馆事业有了发展。农业生产合作社一般都订有报纸。吉林省蛟河县韩恩农业生产合作社的四个生产队，每队都有一份“新农村”，一份“农业技术”，社里还订有“人民日报”、“东北日报”和“吉林日报”。读报组、俱乐部、业余剧团、歌咏队在工厂和农村里更加活跃了。
    苦学苦练
    在学习文化当中，千千万万的工人农民发挥了苦学苦练的精神。全国闻名的劳动模范、李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社的副社长申纪兰，白天劳动，晚上工作，回家还得做饭，有时还要出外开会。人们都这样说，她的工作这么忙，要坚持学习是困难的。可是她自己的想法和大家不一样，她深深感觉到没有文化的困难更多。在她出席世界妇女大会的日子里，因为没有文化，不能很好地把在外国听到的和见到的用文字记载下来和传达出去，她感到懊恼，她觉得对不起祖国的姐妹们！她下定决心要学好文化。她的主要困难是“忙”，她克服这个困难的办法就是“挤”。每天无论劳动、开会都带上书本和水笔，一有空就学习。在地头休息几分钟的时间里，她学习，在开会等人的时候，也拿出书本学习。为了练习记笔记的能力，开会时能记几句就记几句。到外面开会的时候，她总要向教师领课，回来一定交作业。参加一些重要的会议和政治活动后，自己练习着写感想，不会写的就问别人。这样，她从不会签自己的名字到认识一千五百生字，能看报纸和“华北人民”杂志，能写三、五百字的文章了。这样的例子是很多很多的。几年来，在工农业余教育中，出现了成千上万的学习模范。他们曾经从各个方面总结了自己的学习方法，但归纳起来，就是这四个字：苦学苦练。
    工农群众由于深深感受到没有文化的痛苦，所以他们在学习中，不仅自己苦学苦练，还高度发挥了互助友爱的精神。“互教互学”成为我国群众性的工农业余文化教育的特点之一。工农业余学校的教师，绝大多数来自工农，而且有不少是“扫盲班”毕业的学员。在他们当中，涌现了成千上万的模范群众教师。这些群众教师，一般都具有密切联系群众的优良作风。有的群众教师自己文化水平不高，便努力钻研业务，一面学，一面教；有的群众教师能够联系实际，创造许多适合成人学习的教学方法。他们的一个共同愿望是全心全意地为工农文化翻身事业服务。陕北农民模范教师任逢华说：他唯一目的就是要使群众“不花钱，不误工，又学会了字”。凭着“诚”、“信”、“恒”的工作精神，他坚持了近二十年的群众业余文化教育工作。
    第一封信写给毛主席
    几年来开展识字运动的结果，出现了第一批基本上扫除了文盲的工厂：长春新华印刷厂、北京人民印刷厂、抚顺露天煤矿北机电厂、石景山发电厂……在这些工厂里面，每到休息时间，图书馆里总是挤得满满的。长春新华印刷厂职工自己订的报纸已达一百九十五份，大部分职工都能给黑板报或报纸写稿子了。
    农村里出现了不少的“文化村”。吉林省榆树县正义村的农民业余学校，一直坚持了六七年。这个原先是贫困和没有几个识字人的村庄，如今有了农村图书室，成立了农民业余剧团，还组织了农民文艺创作组，一年来，农民创作的文艺作品有二三百篇，有的还在刊物上发表过。
    当然，完全扫除了文盲的工厂和村庄，在目前来说还不太多，但全国扫除文盲的数字是在逐年增加的，到一九五三年为止，在职工中已扫除文盲近一百万人，一九五三年在农民中扫除文盲三百零八万人。许多“扫盲班”毕业的学员升入了业余学校的高级班（组）、业余中学班或业余技术学校，继续提高文化、政治和技术水平。不少在业余高级班或中学班毕业的职工，被选送入工农速成中学或高等学校继续深造。工农群众过去不识字，真是“白纸画黑道，越看越发恼”，现在睁开了文盲的眼睛，看书读报，还能写信、写文章。可以想见他们的心情是多么愉快！许多工人、农民热情地把自己亲手写出的第一封信，寄给敬爱的毛主席，表示他们对共产党和毛主席的说不尽的感激的心情。
    政治和文化水平提高以后
    工农业余学校同时也是进行政治思想教育的重要场所，是党的各种政策有效的宣传阵地。几年来各种政治运动和中心工作，一般都在业余学校里进行过讲解和讨论，一方面提高了工农群众的政治觉悟，一方面又推动了运动的开展。随着政治觉悟和文化水平的提高，工人和农民的生产积极性和创造能力也大大提高了。文化学习对于工人们的找窍门、挖潜力、提合理化建议、改进技术等方面起了很大作用。山西晋生纺织厂工人李兰菊，原来只能看二百纱锭，文化水平提高以后，她努力钻研郝建秀工作法，现在已能看四百纱锭。天津纺织机械厂钳工王鸿志，在学习中懂得了“物体接触面积愈小，所受压力愈大”的道理，改进了工具，提高生产率五倍，并节省了很多材料。罗德运是京汉铁路江岸工务段的三十多年的老模型工人，经过学习，懂得了许多科学道理。他读了詹天佑的故事，受到了启发，决心设计一部螺旋床。由于学会了算术，他能够设计、制图和计算，并能够写笔记，帮助记忆，于是仿制了螺旋床，提高生产率七倍。另外他仿制了木刨机，可提高生产率二十倍。许多优秀工人在提高了文化水平以后，被提拔为生产管理干部和领导干部。如天津棉纺厂职工业余学校学员有一百二十一人被提拔任工资员、会计员、测定员和统计员。兰州市有十二个工人当了厂长或副厂长。这些工人出身的干部，在各个工作岗位上，都保持着工人阶级的优良作风，在工作中发挥了很大的作用。
    农村的冬学和民校在向农民进行社会主义教育方面所起的作用是很显著的。例如，山西长治琚寨村在土地改革以后，农民随着生活的改善，产生了资本主义的自发倾向；有些干部放松了对互助合作的领导，使村里发生了这样的阶级分化：有三户农民发展到雇长工的地步，有十五户农民卖土地卖房子。当时党支部依托民校，向农民进行了社会主义教育，并培养了模范互助组，经过一年多的反复教育，干部和农民中间的资本主义的自发倾向便扭转过来了。一九五一年组织起来的农户达到了全村农户的百分之八十五，第二年大批互助组即转为农业生产合作社。这时又在民校里宣传了苏联集体农庄的美满生活，大大鼓舞了农民走合作化道路的信心和决心，他们自编的一首快板，反映了这种情绪：“单干不如互助好，社比小组更要高，生活要想更美满，集体农场是目标。”
    农民学习了文化，给他们接受科学道理打开了大门。给他们提高生产技术准备了好条件。吉林省榆树县正义村许多农民都懂得肥料的要素——氮、磷、钾，并且知道那种肥料适合那种土壤。村里的农业技术研究小组经常阅读“农业技术”和其他书报，他们在生产中吸收了黑龙江肇源县的丰产经验，推广了“等距宽播”的耕作方法，纠正了“增产到顶”的思想。所以正义村年年丰收。过去在农村推广新农具，曾遇到不少困难。例如步犁是很好的新农具，但有的村子买了之后，因为没人能够看懂使用法说明书，不会使用，只好把它挂在墙上，成了“挂犁”。现在“挂犁”都下地了。
    国家在过渡时期的总任务的宣传，以及国民经济的逐步发展，为工农业余教育的发展创造了更有利的条件：工农群众的社会主义觉悟更加提高了，他们的生活正在日益改善，他们已感觉到为了建设社会主义社会就要提高文化水平，因而学习要求也更加迫切了，而大批高小、初中毕业生从事劳动生产以后，群众教师的队伍空前壮大了。可以相信，在总任务的光辉的照耀下，今后我国的工农业余文化教育事业必定会有更大的发展。（附图片）
