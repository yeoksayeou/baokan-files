    International Public Opinion Advocates for the Restoration of Our Country's Rights in the United Nations
    "Rodong Sinmun" of Korea
    The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published an article on the 20th, entitled "The Legitimate Status of the People's Republic of China Must Be Restored in the United Nations."
    The article pointed out that to restore the prestige of the United Nations, which has been lowered due to the aggressive policies of the United States, it is necessary to abide by the principles stipulated by international law and restore the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. To consolidate world peace and security and ease international tensions, it is necessary to have the joint cooperation of the five major powers.
    The article pointed out: The People's Republic of China has consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy, made great efforts at the Geneva Conference for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and played a significant role in the realization of the Indochina armistice. The People's Republic of China has established peaceful and friendly relations with India and Burma based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and has announced to the world that these principles can also serve as the basis for establishing similar relations with other countries. These facts prove how the People's Republic of China is struggling to safeguard peace in Asia and the world. The people of Asia, along with peace-loving people all over the world, recognize the great role played by the People's Republic of China in international life and resolutely demand the swift restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate status in the United Nations.
    "Trybuna Ludu" of Poland
    Warsaw, 21st (Polish Press Agency): The Polish "Trybuna Ludu" published an article by Broniarek, "What Nations Expect from the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly." The article said that countries around the world believe that the United Nations was created to provide a venue for governments to reach agreements on international disputes through consultation rather than through arbitrary resolutions. The article said: If one of the five major powers, which are specially responsible for maintaining peace according to the United Nations Charter, is excluded from the United Nations, can we talk about achieving this basic task, can we talk about satisfying the demands of all countries? If a powerful China with 600 million people has no representative in the United Nations, can we talk about the universality of this organization? Anyone who has not been deprived of the ability to think reasonably by American propaganda must admit that this situation is indeed absurd.
    The article said: The responsibility for this situation lies with the ruling circles in the United States, who are doing everything they can to prevent the people's China from exercising its rights. This dangerous attitude has aroused indignation in the broadest world opinion and has also aroused growing opposition in many bourgeois governments and political figures. The demand to restore the rights of the People's China in the United Nations has become particularly strong after the Geneva Conference. The results of the Geneva Conference have firmly placed the People's China on the international stage.
    The article also talked about the demands of the people of all countries for an end to the arms race and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons.
    The article pointed out that the delegations of the Soviet Union, Poland, and other countries in the peace camp will continue to fight for the consolidation of peace and international security at the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly.
    "Contemporanul" of Romania
    The Romanian "Contemporanul" published an article entitled "The Great Power, the People's Republic of China."
    The article said: On the eve of the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, the issue that excites world opinion is the issue of restoring the seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. The American politicians are racking their brains, they are attempting not only to hinder the restoration of the People's China's seat in the United Nations, but even to hinder the inclusion of this issue on the agenda of the upcoming session. The voice of a great power like the People's Republic of China would help resolve international disputes. In an effort to hinder the peaceful settlement of international disputes, the American imperialists are desperately helping the Chiang Kai-shek puppet to exist in the United Nations.
    The article said: The result of the imperialists' conspiracy is that they have neither been able to isolate China nor have they been able to prevent China from speaking out on Asian issues and on the entire peace issue. Premier Zhou Enlai and the Prime Ministers of India and Burma issued a joint statement, reaffirming the desire of these countries to pursue a common policy. These statements dealt a blow to the imperialists' Asian policy and paved the way for the common efforts of Asian countries to defend peace. The international prestige of the People's Republic of China is growing day by day. India, Indonesia, and Burma not only recognize the People's Republic of China as a great power, but also express their support for the People's Republic of China to obtain its legitimate rights in the United Nations. The position of these Asian countries is determined based on the fact that the people of these countries believe that the restoration of China's seat in the United Nations is a guarantee for defending peace in the world and in Asia.

### 各国舆论主张恢复我国在联合国的权利

    各国舆论主张恢复我国在联合国的权利
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”二十日发表了一篇论文，题目是“必须恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位”。
    论文指出，要恢复由于美国的侵略政策而降低了的联合国的威信，就必须遵守国际法所规定的各项原则，恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位。要巩固世界和平与安全和缓和国际紧张局势，就必须有五大国的共同合作。
    论文指出：中华人民共和国一直推行着和平外交政策，在日内瓦会议上为和平解决朝鲜问题作了极大的努力，并对印度支那停战的实现起了巨大的作用。中华人民共和国根据和平共处的五项原则同印度和缅甸建立了和平友好的关系，并向全世界宣布这些原则也可作为同其它国家建立同样关系的基础。这些事实，都证明了中华人民共和国为了维护亚洲及世界和平如何地进行着斗争。亚洲人民和全世界爱好和平的人民一起，认定中华人民共和国在国际生活中所起的巨大作用，同时坚决地要求迅速恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位。
    波兰“人民论坛报”
    据波兰通讯社华沙二十一日讯：波兰“人民论坛报”刊载布朗尼亚雷克的文章“各国期望于联合国大会第九届会议的是什么”。文章说：世界各国认为，创立联合国是为了给有关各国政府提供用协商方式而不是用专横通过决议的方式在国际争执问题上取得协议的场所。文章说：如果按照联合国宪章负有维持和平的特殊责任的五大国之一被排除在联合国之外，能够谈到实现这个基本任务，能够谈到满足各国的要求吗？如果六亿人口的强大的中国没有代表在联合国，能够谈到这个组织的世界性吗？任何没有被美国的宣传剥夺了合理思考的能力的人，必然承认这个状况是确实荒谬的。
    文章说：这一状况的责任是在美国统治集团身上，他们随自己的心意用一切办法努力使人民中国不能行使自己的权利。这种危险的态度，在最广泛的世界舆论界激起了愤慨，也在许多资产阶级政府和政界人士中引起日益增长的反对。恢复人民中国在联合国的权利的要求，在日内瓦会议之后已变得特别有力了。日内瓦会议的结果是人民中国稳固地登上了国际舞台。
    文章还谈到各国人民对于结束军备竞赛和禁止原子武器和氢武器的要求。
    文章指出，苏联、波兰和和平阵营其他国家的代表团将在联合国大会第九届会议上继续为巩固和平和国际安全而斗争。
    罗马尼亚“当代周刊”
    罗马尼亚“当代周刊”刊载了一篇文章，题目是“大国中华人民共和国”。
    文章说：在联合国第九届大会前夕，使全世界舆论激动的问题是恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的席位问题。美国的政客们费尽心机，他们企图不仅阻挠恢复人民中国在联合国中的席位，而且甚至阻挠把这一问题列入即将到来的这届大会的议程。像中华人民共和国这样一个大国的发言，是会有助于国际争执问题的解决的。为了努力阻挠国际争执问题的和平解决，美国帝国主义者拼命帮助蒋介石傀儡在联合国存在下去。
    文章说：帝国主义者的阴谋的结果是：他们既没有能够孤立中国，也没有能够阻碍中国在亚洲问题上和在整个和平问题上的发言权。周恩来总理和印度总理及缅甸总理发表了联合声明，重申这些国家奉行共同政策的愿望。这些声明使帝国主义者的亚洲政策受到打击，为亚洲国家保卫和平的共同努力铺平了道路。中华人民共和国的国际威望日益增长了。印度、印度尼西亚和缅甸不仅承认中华人民共和国是一个大国，而且还表示支持中华人民共和国取得在联合国中的合法权利。这些亚洲国家的立场是根据这一事实决定的，这就是：这些国家的人民认为恢复中国在联合国中的席位是保卫全世界和亚洲和平的保证。（新华社）
