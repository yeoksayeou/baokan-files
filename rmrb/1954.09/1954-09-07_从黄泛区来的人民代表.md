    People from the Yellow River flood area suffered deeply in the past. Not only compatriots in the motherland felt sad when they saw it, but also international friends felt very sad. Recently, at the first session of the First People's Congress of Henan Province, Gao Yumei, a people's representative from the Yellow River flood area, announced to the compatriots and friends who cared about them: The people in the Yellow River flood area have overcome the rare disaster in Chinese history, and they are now striding forward on the road to socialism.
    The people of the Yellow River flood area have accumulated a very mature political experience from their own experience, which is what Gao Yumei said: "The People's Government has always acted in accordance with the wishes of the people."
    The people of the Yellow River flood area also clearly know that their wishes can only be realized under the guarantee of the people's democratic system. More than a decade ago, they strongly expressed their wishes. At that time, their greatest wish was to "defeat Japan and eliminate traitors." They encouraged their husbands and sons to join the anti-Japanese guerrillas led by Communist Party members Wang Qimei, Lu Yanling and other comrades, and organized mass anti-Japanese organizations, determined to give the invading Japanese invaders a head-on blow. However, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang wantonly ravaged the anti-Japanese people. In Nanling Village, Xihua County, where Gao Yumei lived, twelve people were buried alive at one time. What is especially hateful is that when the Japanese invaders attacked Henan in 1938, Chiang Kai-shek not only did not resist, but also used sinful hands to pry open the Huayuankou Yellow River levee before fleeing. The rolling Yellow River flooded more than 17 million mu of land and thousands of villages in more than 40 counties in Henan, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces, causing 6 million people to wander and suffer from hunger and cold, and countless deaths. In Xihua and Fugou counties, Henan Province alone, 140,000 to 50,000 people were drowned in the flood.
    In 1947, the troops led by General Liu Bocheng crossed the Yellow River to the south, and the counties in the Yellow River flood area were liberated one after another. The sallow and emaciated victims returned one after another from all directions. At that time, there were no villages or trees in the Yellow River flood area, and everywhere were reeds and weeds, with rotten corpses lying in the mud. In the cold winter, without food and clothing, the victims huddled in temporary thatched sheds built in the weeds to shelter from the wind and snow.
    At that time, the only way out for the people in the Yellow River flood area was to reclaim wasteland for production. The People's Government immediately promulgated the policy of rewarding wasteland reclamation, "whoever reclaims it plants it, and whoever plants it harvests it." At the same time, a large amount of grain, livestock and farm implements were distributed, and everyone was told: "Government relief can only help you through the most difficult time; to completely overcome difficulties and overcome famine, you must rely on mutual assistance and cooperation." So the victims organized to reclaim wasteland. In Nanling Village, Xihua County, Ling Timin, Lu Xiuying, Gao Yumei and other activists took the lead in organizing fourteen wasteland reclamation mutual aid groups; when there were not enough livestock, they also organized women to pull plows and harrows. In the hot summer, their shoulders were red and swollen, but they felt very comfortable. They knew that with the Communist Party and the People's Government, they would be able to overcome the famine and strive for happiness.
    By the autumn of 1948, more than 2,000 mu of wasteland reclaimed by the whole village had been sown with wheat. In 1949, all the more than 900,000 mu of wasteland in Xihua County, which was the most severely affected by the disaster, was reclaimed and planted with crops. At the same time, the Henan Provincial People's Government allocated 300,000 catties of grain, and farmers in neighboring counties also raised tens of thousands of wooden materials and sent them. The people in the Yellow River flood area, relying on their memories, excavated the bricks, tiles and stones buried in the bottom of the silt and built矮矮的小屋.
    After the wasteland was reclaimed, the People's Government continued to provide grain loans and support the people in the Yellow River flood area to restore production. However, the riverbed of the Ying River, a tributary of the Huai River, which runs across the Yellow River flood area for more than a hundred miles, was silted up by the mud and sand swept by the Yellow River. Every summer and autumn, it would burst its banks and cause huge disasters. At this time, dredging rivers, opening canals and developing production became the most urgent demands of the people in the Yellow River flood area.
    The People's Government came to help them realize their demands.
    With the development of my country's great Huai River control project, the People's Government has used work-for-relief methods to manage the Ying River several times. When I went to the Yellow River flood area in the autumn of 1950, a large-scale Ying River control project was in full swing. On the long bank of the Ying River, red flags and colorful clouds reflected each other, and tens of thousands of migrant workers waved their shovels in the sound of cheering slogans. At that time, the dozen or so wasteland reclamation teams led by Lu Xiuying, Gao Yumei (they were successively accepted into the Party as glorious Communist Party members) and Ling Heini had been transformed into agricultural production cooperatives and regular mutual aid groups. Gao Yumei led a team of young women and men to the Ying River control site, while Lu Xiuying stayed in the village to organize more than 200 women for agricultural production because she was giving birth. They launched a competition under the slogan "Men dig rivers, women produce, and thousands of miles of flooded areas become good fields." On the banks of the Ying River, the sound of migrant workers digging the river was constantly carried by the breeze, and bursts of hearty laughter from the women also rippled in the vast fields.
    At that time, there was a labor model, Aunt Chen, on the bank of the Ying River who had met Chairman Mao in Beijing. The migrant workers felt that this was the most glorious and happiest thing. Therefore, "striving to meet Chairman Mao in Beijing" became the greatest encouragement for all migrant workers. Gao Yumei also exerted a high degree of labor enthusiasm under this encouragement with the women's team. After working every day, she waited until the migrant workers were asleep at night, dragged her tired body to wash all the mud bags, and put the tools and bowls and chopsticks in order, and then went to see if the migrant workers were sleeping well before she lay down. She got up again before dawn in the morning, woke up her sisters to cook the rice, so that the migrant workers could eat very comfortably, and after eating, she went with the migrant workers to carry big baskets and rolled up her trouser legs to go down to the ditch to splash water. Her shoulders were crushed and her legs were swollen from soaking, but she always smiled and encouraged others: "In the past, the more we worked, the poorer we became. Now labor is glorious. Let's quickly dig the river well, and then we can produce well and live a happy life!" Gao Yumei and her women's team encouraged the migrant workers spiritually and took care of them in life. As a result, the "front line" and "rear area" of Nanling Village achieved victory at the same time: after the "rear area" harvested the first season of good wheat, Lu Xiuying led the women in the village to complete the autumn land cultivation in a timely manner without livestock and farm implements; the "front line" completed the river digging task twenty days ahead of schedule. At the county's river management model evaluation meeting, Gao Yumei was selected as a special-class labor model. At the same time, her wish came true - she went to Beijing with the honor of the people in the Yellow River flood area to meet Chairman Mao.
    Since 1951, the people in the Yellow River flood area have been initially free from the Ying River flood. At the same time, they have personally experienced the benefits of mutual assistance and cooperation for several years. Therefore, mutual assistance and cooperation organizations in various places have developed like mushrooms after a rain. This has made their ability to fight against natural disasters stronger day by day, and grain production has increased year by year. Taking Xihua County as an example: in 1951, the wheat planting area in the county was 635,576 mu, with an average yield of 105 catties per mu, and the total income was 66,735,480 catties; by 1954, the wheat planting area in the county had expanded to 1,011,750 mu, and the average yield per mu had increased to 127 catties, and the total income reached more than 128 million catties. The agricultural production cooperative led by Ling Heini and Lu Xiuying in Nanling Village was originally organized by the more than 40 households in the village who were the most difficult when they returned from famine. In 1951, the whole cooperative harvested 150,000 catties of grain, with an average income of 1,000 catties per person. In addition to eating, using, and repaying national loans, they also invested in the cooperative and added fertilizer and new farm implements. By 1952, the average wheat yield per mu in the whole cooperative was 147 catties, an increase of 44 catties per mu compared with 1951. Although the wheat in the whole cooperative suffered from frost last year, it still achieved a bumper harvest due to sufficient fertilizer and close planting. Since then, every household has built new houses and moved towards a life of abundance.
    Now, the Yellow River flood area has become really rich and beautiful. The sun shines on the boundless green fields, the green willows cover the clusters of new villages, and on the quiet water surface of the Ying River, ships come and go, and flocks of geese and ducks gather. During festivals, red flags are hung high in the villages, songs are rippling, people put on new clothes, bow and salute to Chairman Mao's portrait, and smiles appear on every plump and rosy face from time to time.
    The people in the Yellow River flood area have longed for the happy socialist life in the Soviet Union for a long time. Since liberation, especially after studying the general line, they have been consciously creating this happy life.
    The state has successively established mechanized farms and agricultural machinery stations in the Yellow River flood area, and began to focus on cultivating land for agricultural production cooperatives last autumn. This incident has brought the people in the Yellow River flood area a thirst for a new life. In the past, the people in the Yellow River flood area suffered from too much land and insufficient labor, and could not take good care of the land; with tractor cultivation, this problem was solved. Not only was the plowing deep, the harrowing was fine, and the sowing was timely and uniform, but it also greatly saved labor. The two cooperatives led by Gao Yumei and Ling Heini used machine farming with the help of the agricultural machinery station, saving 8,000 labor days from planting wheat last year to harvesting this year, which were used for land processing, water conservancy construction, sideline production and fertilizer accumulation. Gao Yumei happily told everyone at the Henan Provincial People's Congress that the first season of wheat cultivated by her agricultural production cooperative with machines increased by more than 10% compared with last year, attracting farmers around to turn from mutual aid groups to cooperatives. Four new cooperatives were established in Nanling Village alone, preparing to use machine farming. At the urgent request of the farmers, the first collective farm in the Yellow River flood area will be established in Nanling Village in the near future.
    These vivid facts have condensed into a new wish in the minds of the people in the Yellow River flood area - the socialist industrialization of the motherland.
    Last year, in order to realize their wish, they sold a large amount of surplus grain to the state. The two agricultural production cooperatives led by Gao Yumei and Ling Heini sold 280 shi of surplus grain.
    In early August this year, Gao Yumei attended the first session of the Henan Provincial People's Congress again. At the meeting, people gave cordial care to the representative from the Yellow River flood area. Gao Yumei used this noble and precious wish of the people in the Yellow River flood area as the standard, and together with all the representatives, reviewed the work report and financial budget of the Provincial People's Government, and adopted the suggestion put forward by the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Congress that striving for the socialist industrialization of the country should be the central task of the people of the province. The people in the Yellow River flood area have reason to believe that in the past, their wishes have been realized one by one under the guarantee of the people's democratic system; in the future, under the guarantee of a more complete people's democratic system, the realization of their wishes will be more certain, just like grasping it in their own hands.

    从黄泛区来的人民代表
  　本报记者  吕建中
    黄泛区人民过去遭受的深重灾难，不仅祖国的同胞看了难过，就是国际朋友看了也非常难过。最近，在河南省第一届人民代表大会第一次会议上，从黄泛区来的人民代表高玉梅向关心他们的同胞们、朋友们宣布了：黄泛区人民已经战胜了中国历史上罕有的灾难，他们现在正在通往社会主义的大路上阔步前进。
    黄泛区人民从亲身经历中积累了一条十分成熟的政治经验，这就是高玉梅所说的：“人民政府从来就是按照人民的愿望办事的。”
    黄泛区人民也清楚地知道，他们的愿望只有在人民民主制度的保证之下才能实现。远在十几年前，他们曾强烈地表现过自己的愿望，那时候他们的最大愿望是“打倒日本，铲除汉奸”。他们一面鼓励自己的丈夫和儿子纷纷参加了共产党员王其梅、路岩岭等同志所领导的抗日游击队，一面组织起群众抗日组织，坚决要给进犯的日寇以迎头痛击。可是蒋介石匪帮对抗日的人民横加摧残，高玉梅所在的西华县南凌村一次就被活埋了十二人。尤其可恨的是，当一九三八年日寇打到河南的时候，蒋介石不独不抵抗，反倒在溃逃之前，用罪恶的手扒开了花园口黄河堤，滚滚黄水淹没了河南、安徽、江苏三省四十余县约一千七百万亩土地和数千个村庄，使六百万人民到处流浪飘泊，陷于饥寒交迫的境地，死亡无数。仅河南省的西华、扶沟两县，在大水中就被淹死了十四、五万人。
    一九四七年刘伯承将军所领导的部队渡黄河南下，黄泛区各县先后解放了，面黄饥瘦的灾民从四面八方陆续归来。那时，黄泛区没有村庄和树木，到处是芦苇、荒草，泥淖里横着腐烂的人尸。冷冬数九，衣食无着，灾民们蜷伏在荒草窝里临时搭起的茅棚里遮蔽风雪。
    那时黄泛区人民唯一的出路就是开荒生产。人民政府立即颁布了“谁开谁种，谁种谁收”的奖励开荒政策。同时又发放了大批粮食、牲口和农具，并告诉大家说：“政府的救济，只能帮助大家渡过最困难的关头；要彻底克服困难，渡过灾荒，必须靠大家互助合作。”于是灾民们便纷纷组织起来开荒。西华县南凌村由凌体民、陆秀英、高玉梅等积极分子带头组织起十四个开荒互助组；牲口不足，就把妇女也组织起来拉犁拉耙。到了炎热的夏天，她们的肩膀勒得红肿，但是心里却很舒畅。她们知道，有了共产党和人民政府，她们就一定能够战胜灾荒，争得幸福。
    到一九四八年秋，全村开出的两千多亩荒地，播种了小麦。一九四九年，受灾最重的西华县全境九十多万亩荒地就全部开垦完毕，种上庄稼。与此同时，河南省人民政府又拨给三十万斤粮食，邻县农民也募集了数万根木料送来，黄泛区人民凭着记忆，把淤在地底下的房屋砖瓦石料挖掘出来，筑起矮矮的小屋。
    荒地开完了，人民政府又继续不断地发放贷粮贷款，扶持黄泛区人民恢复生产。但是横贯在黄泛区的一条长达百余里的淮河支流——颖河的河床，被黄水卷来的泥沙淤塞了，每逢夏秋两季就溃决泛滥，酿成巨灾。这时候，挖河开渠，发展生产，就成为黄泛区人民最迫切的要求了。
    人民政府就来帮助他们实现自己的要求。
    随着我国伟大的治淮工程的开展，人民政府数次以工代赈治理颖河。一九五零年秋我去黄泛区的时候，一次大规模的治颖工程正进行得热火朝天，漫长的颖河岸上，红旗彩霞交相辉映，数万民工在欢腾的口号声中挥动着铁锹。那时候，陆秀英、高玉梅（她们先后被党接受为光荣的共产党员了。）和凌黑妮等所领导的十几个开荒小组已经转为农业生产合作社和正规的互助组了。高玉梅领着一队青年妇女和男人们一起涌上治颖工地，陆秀英因为生孩子便留在村里组织起二百多个妇女进行农业生产。他们在“男挖河，女生产，千里泛区变良田”的口号下展开了竞赛。颖河岸上，微风不断地送来民工挖河的声响，辽阔的田野里也阵阵荡起妇女们爽朗的笑声。
    那时候，颖河岸上有一位劳动模范陈大娘曾经到北京见过毛主席，民工们觉得这是一件最光荣，最幸福的事情。因此，“争取到北京见毛主席”就成了全体民工最大的鼓舞力量。高玉梅也就在这种鼓舞下和妇女队发挥了高度的劳动热情。她每天劳动之后，晚上等民工们都睡下了，拖着疲惫的身子把泥兜统统洗一遍，把工具、碗筷都收拾停当，再去看看民工们睡得好不好，自己才躺下。早晨天不亮她又起来了，喊醒姊妹们把饭做好，让民工们吃得挺舒服，吃罢饭她又随着民工去抬大筐，挽起裤腿下沟泼水。她的肩膀压烂了，两腿泡得红肿，她却总是笑着鼓励别人说：“过去咱越劳动越受穷，如今劳动是光荣的，咱们赶紧把河挖好，以后尽管好好生产过幸福日子啦！”高玉梅和她的妇女队就是这样从精神上鼓舞着民工，从生活上关照着民工，结果南凌村的“前线”和“后方”同时取得了胜利：“后方”在收获了第一季好麦之后，陆秀英领导着村里的妇女在缺乏牲口农具的条件下，用人力把秋地及时耕种完毕；“前方”则提前二十天完成了挖河任务。在全县治河评模大会上，高玉梅被选为特等劳动模范。同时她的愿望也实现了——她带着黄泛区人民的荣誉到北京见了毛主席。
    从一九五一年开始，黄泛区人民就初步免除了颖河水患，同时几年来他们亲身体验到了互助合作的好处，因此各地互助合作组织像雨后春笋似的发展起来。这就越使他们与自然灾害作斗争的能力一天比一天加强，粮食生产量也一年比一年提高。以西华县为例：一九五一年全县小麦播种面积六十三万五千五百七十六亩，每亩平均产量一百零五斤，总收入是六千六百七十三万五千四百八十斤；到一九五四年全县小麦播种面积扩大到一百零一万一千七百五十亩，每亩平均产量提高到一百二十七斤，总收入达到一亿二千八百多万斤。这个县南凌村凌黑妮、陆秀英所领导的农业生产合作社原是村里逃荒回来时最困难的四十多户组织起来的。一九五一年全社收了十五万斤粮食，每人平均收入一千斤，除了吃、用、归还国家贷款，又向社里投了资，添了肥料和新农具。到一九五二年，全社小麦每亩平均收到一百四十七斤，比一九五一年每亩增产四十四斤。去年全社小麦虽然受了霜灾，但是由于肥料足，又实行了密植，仍然获得了丰收。从此家家户户都盖了新房，走向丰衣足食了。
    现在，黄泛区变得实在富饶美丽，阳光照拂着无边绿野，绿柳掩映着簇簇新村，静静的颖河水面上，船舶来往，鹅鸭成群。逢年过节，村落里红旗高挂，歌声荡漾，人们穿起新衣，朝着毛主席像鞠躬行礼，每个丰满红润的脸上时时现露笑容。
    黄泛区人民对苏联的社会主义幸福生活向往很久，解放以后特别是学习过总路线以后他们已经在自觉地创造着这种幸福生活。
    国家先后在黄泛区建立了机耕农场和农业机器站，去年秋天并开始有重点地给农业生产合作社耕地。这件事情又给黄泛区人民带来了对新生活的渴求。过去，黄泛区人民苦于土地多，劳力不足，顾不得好好在土地上加工；用拖拉机耕种，这个问题就解决了，不仅犁得深，耙得细，播种及时、匀称，而且大大节省了劳动力。高玉梅和凌黑妮领导的两个社在农业机器站帮助下用机器耕作，从去年种麦到今年收割完毕，就节省出八千个劳动日用到土地加工、兴修水利、副业生产和积肥等方面去。高玉梅在河南省人民代表大会会议上喜气洋溢地告诉大家，她领导的农业生产合作社用机器耕种的第一季小麦就比去年增产一成多，吸引得周围农民纷纷由互助组转为合作社，光南凌村就成立了四个新社，准备用机器耕种。在农民的迫切要求下，黄泛区第一个集体农庄不久的将来就会在南凌村建立起来。
    这些活生生的事实，就在黄泛区人民的脑子里凝结成了一个新的愿望——祖国的社会主义工业化。
    去年，他们为了实现自己这个愿望，把大批的余粮卖给了国家，高玉梅和凌黑妮领导的两个农业生产合作社就卖出余粮二百八十石。
    今年八月上旬，高玉梅又出席了河南省第一届人民代表大会会议。会上，人们对于这位从黄泛区来的代表给以亲切关怀，高玉梅就以黄泛区人民的这种高尚的、珍贵的愿望为标准，和全体代表一起，审查了省人民政府的工作报告和财政预算，通过了以中共河南省委向大会提出为国家的社会主义工业化而奋斗的建议做为全省人民的中心任务。黄泛区人民有理由相信：过去，他们的愿望在人民民主制度保证之下一件一件的都实现了；今后，在更加完备的人民民主制度的保障下，他们这种愿望的实现就会更有把握，就像是抓在自己的手里一样。
