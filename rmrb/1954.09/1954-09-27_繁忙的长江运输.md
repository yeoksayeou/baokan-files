    Busy Yangtze River Transport
    By our correspondent Cao Baoming
    The Yangtze River is China's largest river, its magnificent waters flowing through more than five thousand kilometers of land. Along its two thousand eight hundred kilometer trunk line from Yibin to Wusongkou, ships travel year-round. There are also eighteen navigable tributaries, connecting with the Yangtze to form a river transport network. The modern Yangtze River shipping industry closely connects Sichuan, the "Land of Abundance," the area near Dongting Lake, the "Granary," and Jiangnan, the "Land of Fish and Rice," with Shanghai, China's largest metropolis, and Wuhan, the "Thoroughfare of Nine Provinces," facilitating the exchange of goods across thousands of kilometers.
    The modern shipping industry on the Yangtze River has a history of over eighty years. But from its earliest days, it suffered the ravages of imperialism along with the suffering of old China. Imperialist warships, accompanied by merchant ships, rampaged across the Yangtze, using it as a blood-sucking tube, drawing the blood of the Chinese people year after year. At the riverbank in Huangshi City, two giant ore unloaders still lie, used by Japanese imperialism to steal tens of millions of tons of iron ore from the Daye Iron Mine.
    Martyr Fang Zhimin wrote in his book "Lovely China": "Does China have warships and steamers navigating in foreign inland rivers? If not, aren't foreigners clearly bullying the Chinese? Can the Chinese just bow their heads and endure their bullying?"
    More than a decade after "Lovely China" was written, the Chinese people stood up. The Yangtze no longer allows imperialist warships and merchant ships to flaunt their power. Yangtze River shipping is now bustling day and night for the people of the motherland, for the socialist construction of the motherland.
    The busy Yangtze River shipping transports hundreds of thousands of tons of grain from Sichuan, Hubei, and Jiangxi to Shanghai, Dalian, and Tianjin every year; hundreds of thousands of cubic meters of timber from Hankou and Jiujiang to Nanjing and Zhenjiang; millions of tons of coal from Huainan, Jiawang, and Daye; and more than ten thousand tons of cotton from Hubei, to support the production of Shanghai power plants and spinning mills; and more than a million head of live pigs from northern Jiangsu to supply the people of Shanghai with food; and more than ten thousand tons of sea salt, tens of thousands of tons of cloth, and more than ten thousand tons of general merchandise from Shanghai to various places along the river. In this complex flow of goods, there are also large quantities of local products such as tung oil, raw lacquer, pig bristles, and casings, as well as minerals such as copper, tin, antimony, lead, tungsten, and manganese, and diesel engines, water pumps, and other industrial equipment. Sichuan oranges and Jiangxi Nanfeng tangerines, which used to rot due to difficulties in external transportation, are now sold throughout the country and even abroad via the Yangtze River shipping.
    During the construction of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, sailors transported six hundred thousand tons of equipment in one and a half months. During the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, an unprecedented low water level in the Yangtze River occurred, making navigation difficult, but the sailors reversed the practice of not being able to load much during low water levels, and fully loaded fleets cleverly passed through the shallow and rapid upper reaches of the Yangtze River, delivering steel billets and equipment needed to build more than five hundred kilometers of railway in a timely manner. Since then, the Yangtze River has transported various equipment and materials for the construction of industry and transportation in the Southwest every year.
    The Yangtze River waterway, which had not been repaired for thousands of years, has begun to be repaired after the founding of New China. The Daijia Island shallow waterway upstream of Nanjing has been dredged, and the dangerous Guanyin Shoal upstream of Yichang has been blasted. Now, the Yangtze River Navigation Administration is conducting exploration and blasting projects at several dangerous shoals in the upper reaches to make the shallow and rapid waterways deeper and wider, suitable for navigation. The navigational marks on the Hankou-Shanghai section, which had been in disrepair for many years and had lost their navigation function, have been rectified, and the marker lights have been changed from one every five kilometers to one every two and a half kilometers. New marker lights have also been built on the Hankou-Yichang section, and the nearly one thousand eight hundred kilometer route from Yichang to Shanghai can now be navigated day and night.
    In the past few years, the Yangtze River Navigation Administration has also salvaged ships destroyed by the Kuomintang bandits from the bottom of the river, and restored and rebuilt one hundred and sixteen ships, and built forty-eight new ships. During the year or so of public-private joint venture, Minsheng Company increased its ships by more than 22,000 tons.
    Along the thousands of miles of the Yangtze River route, sailors are constantly striving to improve navigation efficiency. On the route from Luxian to Shanghai, it is common to see a tugboat towing many barges, forming a long fleet, just like a train on a railway. This is the sailors' use of the advanced navigation experience of the Soviet one-train towing method. The one-train towing method has increased the towing capacity of each horsepower of the tugboat by an average of two to three times. The carrying capacity of ships throughout the Yangtze River has also increased by 20% to 50% due to the implementation of the one-train towing method by the tug-barge fleet, which accounts for 60% of the total cargo capacity, and the turnover rate has increased by 20%. The Huaxin No. 1 ship has further learned the latest Soviet pushing method, increasing the sailing speed by 48% and saving coal consumption by 45%. This method is gradually being promoted upstream.
    On the basis of continuously reducing costs, the freight rates of Yangtze River shipping have been reduced four times successively. The results of the first three freight rate reductions have reduced the entire freight rate by 32% compared with the early days of liberation, with the largest reduction being for local products and special products, which are about 80% lower than in the early days of liberation. The fourth freight rate reduction in July this year was an average of 8% lower than last year's freight rate, of which the cost of industrial construction equipment was reduced by 20%.
    With the development of industrial construction, the state has established new ports and business stations in the emerging industrial city of Huangshi and Badong and Wuxue, which are material distribution centers in western and eastern Hubei. The volume of cargo transported on the Yangtze River increases year by year, more than doubling last year compared to 1950, and this year's plan is more than double that of last year.
    In order to develop Yangtze River shipping and meet the needs of industrial and agricultural production, the state has invested a large amount of funds to build hundreds of ships in the next few years, build new tugboats suitable for Yangtze River shipping, expand old shipyards, build new shipyards, continue to dredge waterways, and carry out port construction. After this plan is realized, the number of ships on the Yangtze River will increase by 66% compared to now, and the transport volume will double. The Yangtze River will play a greater role in national construction.

    繁忙的长江运输
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    长江是我国第一条大河，雄伟壮阔的江水流过五千多公里的土地。从宜宾到吴淞口这两千八百多公里的干线上，轮船四季通行，另有十八条通航的支流，和长江连成一个河运网。近代的长江航运事业把“天府之国”的四川、“粮仓”的洞庭湖滨、“鱼米之乡”的江南，把我国第一大都市上海、“九省通衢”的武汉，紧密地连结在一起，沟通了数千公里地带的物资交流。
    长江上现代化的航运事业已有八十多年历史。但从最初的日子起，她就同苦难的旧中国一起，遭受着帝国主义的蹂躏。帝国主义的兵舰伴同着商船在长江上横冲直闯，它们把长江当做吸血筒，长年累月地吮吸着中国人民的血液。黄石市江边至今还躺着两架巨大的卸矿机，日本帝国主义用它盗走了大冶铁山数千万吨铁矿石。
    方志敏烈士曾在“可爱的中国”一书里写道：“中国有兵舰和轮船在外国内河行驶吗？如果没有的话，外国人不是明明白白欺负中国人吗？中国人难道就能够低下头来活受他们的欺负不成？”
    “可爱的中国”脱稿十余年后，中国人民站起来了。长江再不允许帝国主义的兵舰和商船耀武扬威。长江的航运在为祖国人民，为祖国的社会主义建设日夜奔忙。
    繁忙的长江航运，每年从四川、湖北和江西运出数十万吨粮食到上海、大连和天津；从汉口、九江运出数十万立方公尺的木材到南京、镇江；从淮南、贾汪和大冶运出上百万吨的煤炭，从湖北运出十多万吨棉花，去支援上海电厂和纱厂的生产；从苏北运去一百多万头生猪供应上海人民的食用；又从上海运出十多万吨海盐、数万吨布匹和十多万吨百货到沿江各地。在这错综复杂的货物流向里，还有大批桐油、生漆、猪鬃和肠衣等土产，还有铜、锡、锑、铅、钨、锰等矿产，以及柴油机、抽水机和其他工业器材。过去因外运困难而常常任其腐烂的四川广柑和江西南丰橘子，也经由长江航运行销全国，并且行销国外了。
    在修建荆江分洪工程的日子里，海员们以一个半月的时间运去了六十万吨器材。修建成渝铁路时，恰遇长江十五年来未有的枯水位，航行不便，但海员们扭转了枯水不能多装载的惯例，满载的船队机智地穿过水浅流急的长江上游，及时运送了修建五百多公里长的铁路所需的钢胚和器材。以后，长江每年都为西南工业和交通运输业的建设运送各种设备和器材。
    几千年来从未修整过的长江水道，在新中国诞生后已经开始整修了。南京上游的戴家洲浅水道被疏浚了，宜昌上游险恶的观音滩被炸平了。现在，长江航务局正在上游几个险滩处进行勘探和炸滩工程，要使水浅流急的航道变得又深又阔，适于航行。年久失修而已失去导航作用的汉口——上海段的航标，已经过一番整顿，标灯由五公里一个改为两公里半一个，汉口——宜昌段也建设了新的标灯，从宜昌到上海近一千八百多公里航线上已能日夜航行。
    几年来，长江航务局还将被国民党匪帮破坏的船舶从江底打捞起来，并恢复和改建了一百一十六艘船舶，新建了四十八艘船舶。民生公司在公私合营的一年多期间增加了船舶两万两千多吨。
    数千里长江航线上，海员们不断地为提高航行效率而奋斗。在泸县到上海的航线上，常见一个拖轮拖着许多驳船，组成长长的船队，就像铁路上的列车一样，这便是海员们在采用苏联一列式拖带法的先进航行经验。一列式拖带法使拖轮每匹马力的拖带能力平均提高了二倍到三倍。整个长江的船舶载运量，也因为占全部运货能力百分之六十的拖驳船队实行了一列式拖带法，而提高了百分之二十至五十，周转率提高了百分之二十。华新一号轮又进一步学习了苏联最新的顶推法，提高了航行速度百分之四十八，节约了燃煤百分之四十五。这个方法正在上游逐渐推广。
    在不断降低成本的基础上，长江航运的运价先后降低了四次。前三次降低运价的结果便使全线整个运价比解放初期降低百分之三十二，其中减得最多的是土产、特产，约比解放初期降低百分之八十。今年七月份第四次降低运价，又比去年运价平均降低了百分之八，其中工业建设器材降低了百分之二十。
    随着工业建设的发展，国家在新兴的工业城市黄石和湖北西部、湖北东部的物资集散地巴东、武穴等地建立了新的港口和营业站。长江货运量一年比一年增加，去年就比一九五零年增加了两倍多，今年的计划又比去年增加一倍以上。
    为了发展长江航运，满足工农业生产的需要，国家投放了大量的资金，要在几年中修建上百艘船舶，修建适合长江航运的新式拖轮；要扩充旧有的修船厂，建设新的修船厂；要继续疏浚航道，并进行港埠建设。这个计划实现以后，长江的船只将比现在增加百分之六十六，运输量将比现在增加一倍。长江将在国家建设中发挥更大的作用。
