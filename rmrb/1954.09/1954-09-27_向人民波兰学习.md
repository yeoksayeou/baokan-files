    Learning from People's Poland
    Head of the Chinese Cultural Delegation to Poland, Yang Hansheng
    (I)
    The Chinese Cultural Delegation to Poland, at the invitation of the Polish government, arrived in Warsaw on June 29th, left Poland on August 3rd, and returned home via Moscow, spending more than a month visiting Poland. The delegation's members included seven people: poets, writers, composers, singers, playwrights, and artists. We visited the capital of People's Poland, Warsaw, the ancient cultural city of Krakow and the nearby New Steel City, the industrial city of Stalinogród, the port of Gdansk, and the Zakopane mountain region. We toured factories, mines, farms, and many cultural and artistic groups, watched many artistic performances and exhibitions, and held several discussions and individual conversations with advanced producers in factories and rural areas, as well as prominent figures in cultural and artistic circles in various places. We witnessed the enormous and brilliant achievements of People's Poland in economic and cultural construction and personally felt the warm, brotherly love of the Polish people for the people of our country. We felt incredibly excited and also learned many valuable things.
    The great achievements of Poland in socialist industrial construction, and the heroic spirit and patriotic enthusiasm shown by the Polish working class in gloriously working to complete the national six-year construction plan ahead of schedule, greatly inspired us. The progress of Poland's socialist industrialization six-year plan (1950-1955) is astonishing. Taking 1953 as an example, the original plan stipulated that the value of socialist industrial output in 1953 should reach 197.1 percent of the 1949 level, but in 1953 it had already reached 228.6 percent. Industrial output has developed to 3.6 times that of pre-war (1938), and the value of socialist industrial output has accounted for more than 99 percent of the total industrial output value. As Comrade Bolesław Bierut pointed out in his summary report on the work of the Central Committee at the Second Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party: "The main task of the country's socialist industrialization has been successfully completed basically in the period from 1950 to 1953. Poland has changed from a backward agricultural country, from an agricultural raw material supply market of imperialist countries, into a socialist industrial country with enormous and growing economic potential."
    We saw that in factories and mines, the enthusiasm for labor and creation was boiling everywhere. Our conversations with Stakhanovite movement participants in various places were very exciting. For example, in the Warsaw Zeran Automobile Factory, an advanced young worker led a tool production department, making it consistently the factory's advanced section; he himself completed 300 percent of his production plan. In the Bytom mining area, a coal miner, in a long-term production competition, consistently completed 200 percent of his plan. In 1952, he had already completed all his production tasks in the six-year plan and will complete his 1961 task ahead of schedule next January. There are many such moving examples. What particularly excited us was our visit to the newly built steel city near Krakow, the Lenin Metallurgical Combine called "Nowa Huta". Four years ago, it was just a wasteland. With the vigorous assistance of the Soviet Union, after four years of intense efforts by the Polish working class, a huge steel enterprise, one of the largest and most modern steel centers in Europe, has miraculously risen. Near the steel plant, a new socialist city capable of accommodating 100,000 residents is being built for the workers. We visited this steel plant and workers' city, which has already been initially completed, and saw male and female workers happily and selflessly laboring in the workshops and beside the cranes. We saw the huge slogans "All Poland Builds Nowa Huta" and "Peace · Bierut." We felt joy and pride in the heroic spirit and creative spirit of the Polish working class.
    The Polish working farmers are also contributing their strength to the socialist transformation of agriculture. Rural electrification and collectivization have made great progress. In the Gdansk Province, we visited a collective farm. The farmers excitedly told us how they had overcome various difficulties to gradually develop the farm, and how, with the strong support of the state and the selfless labor of the members, the 1953 production plan was successfully completed: wheat 100 percent, potatoes 180 percent, meat 350 percent, and milk 800 percent.
    The patriotic spirit and labor enthusiasm of the Polish people are most clearly expressed in the reconstruction of Warsaw. During the war, the disasters caused by fascist bandits in Poland, especially in Warsaw, were extremely devastating. Hitler threatened to erase Warsaw from the map, and the beautiful Warsaw was destroyed into a scorched earth. For ten years, the Polish people have been rebuilding their capital from the ruins with great determination and perseverance. Now, a new city of Warsaw has stood majestically, and it is more beautiful and magnificent than in the past. The work of rebuilding Warsaw is truly an epitome of Poland's socialist construction and an outstanding example of building a socialist city. On the one hand, it strives to restore the beautiful buildings of the past and preserve the traditional national style, and on the other hand, it is carried out according to the most reasonable design, with every house having modern facilities and every area having schools, nurseries, hospitals, parks, cinemas, department stores, etc. The victory of rebuilding Warsaw is a great encouragement not only to the Polish people but also to peace-loving people all over the world. The workers and intellectuals of Warsaw excitedly told us how they had participated in the reconstruction of the capital, and how, inspired by the slogan "The whole nation rebuilds Warsaw" put forward by the Party and the government, working people and young men and women from all over the country came to Warsaw in groups to participate in glorious voluntary labor. All this deeply moved us.
    The ardent patriotic spirit and labor spirit shown by the Polish people in the work of building their motherland are worthy of our learning.
    (II)
    Along with the rapid progress of national economic construction, Poland's achievements in culture and education are also enormous and remarkable. At present, Poland has eliminated illiteracy among residents under the age of 50. The slogan "No child should be out of school" put forward by the United Workers' Party has been fully realized. In ordinary middle schools, young workers and farmers account for 61 percent. In institutions of higher learning, young workers account for 34.1 percent, and young farmers account for 25 percent. There are 47 college students per 10,000 people in the country. Since liberation, the cultural level of the people has been significantly improved.
    Under the leadership and support of the United Workers' Party and the Polish government, Poland's cultural and artistic circles, on the one hand, vigorously popularize the new socialist culture and encourage new literary and artistic creations; at the same time, they vigorously carry forward their excellent national traditions and extensively carry out folk art activities to enhance the people's patriotic spirit and national pride. These tasks have all achieved great results.
    According to statistics in 1953, the total number of newspapers issued nationwide reached 1.5 billion, the total number of magazines issued reached 352 million, and the number of books and pamphlets issued exceeded 90 million; the highest sales of literary works reached more than one million copies. In 1953, the national theater audience was about 12.5 million, and the movie audience was 152 million. Considering Poland's population (currently more than 26.5 million), these figures are sufficient to illustrate the degree of popularization of the new culture.
    Poland's socialist realism literature and art has laid a good foundation in the struggle against bourgeois influence and formalism. The Party and the government have adopted a policy of encouragement as the main approach to developing new literary and artistic creations. The government awards national prizes every year to outstanding literary, musical, and artistic creations, theatrical, musical, and dance performances, artistic and scientific treatises, and other creative activities in art (such as artists assisting in the artistic design of rebuilding the ancient city of Warsaw, and professional theatrical troupes guiding amateur artistic activities). At the recent celebration of the tenth anniversary of Poland's National Revival Day, many writers and artists were awarded national medals. Under the conscious labor spirit of writers and artists and the encouragement of the state, writers are writing enthusiastically, and literary and artistic creation and performances are increasingly showing a lively atmosphere. During our stay in Warsaw and various cities, we met many poets, writers, composers, painters, directors, etc. Each of them had specific creative plans and loved their careers so much. They focused on creative labor, striving to contribute their intelligence and talent to the motherland and the people.
    Poland's cultural and artistic circles have carried out systematic, extensive, and in-depth work in sorting out and carrying forward their nation's excellent cultural traditions. The Polish people highly respect their nation's past cultural celebrities, such as Copernicus, Chopin, Mickiewicz, and famous painters and playwrights. Statues are erected for them, their former residences are preserved, their works are promoted, and memorial halls are established. During our stay in Warsaw, we visited the Copernicus Pavilion in the Polish Renaissance Exhibition, the Mickiewicz Memorial Hall, and paid a visit to Chopin's former residence, expressing our admiration for the Polish people and their outstanding geniuses for their outstanding contributions to progressive human culture. As far as we know, since the Polish State Council decided to publish the complete works of the poet Mickiewicz in 1945, a total of 3.85 million copies have been printed by 1953, of which more than 1.6 million copies of "Pan Tadeusz" (which has been translated into Chinese) have been printed. All of Chopin's works have been recorded on records, radio stations hold Chopin concerts every two or three days, and Chopin's former residence holds Chopin music concerts every Sunday. Although the former residence is dozens of kilometers away from the city, there are still three or four thousand listeners each time. The Polish government is now organizing the International Chopin Piano Competition and has gathered a large number of pianists in the countryside of Gdansk to intensify their research and study, which has now formed a craze for studying Chopin. In addition, the theatrical circles have also conducted systematic research on great playwrights such as Słowacki in the 19th century, and the art circles have also conducted systematic research on great painters such as Matejko in the previous century, and have also promoted them to the general public in various ways.
    Poland's artists have made great efforts in sorting out ancient artistic heritage and folk art. Based on the results of years of research, the National Academy of Arts is compiling "Encyclopedia of Polish Music," "Encyclopedia of Polish Fine Arts," and "History of Polish Drama." The Institute of Folk Music under the academy sends specialists to systematically collect folk songs throughout the country, including tunes, melodies, and their geographical and customs backgrounds, and has now recorded 60,000 folk songs and folk music. Polish artists and architects have also made outstanding achievements in studying ancient and folk architectural styles in Poland and developing national forms of architecture and architectural decoration. The restoration of the medieval architecture of the ancient city of Warsaw and the Renaissance architecture of the new city is a good example, and a group of artists have won national prizes for this. In addition, artists have also made great achievements in the study of national costumes. We visited a clothing exhibition hall in a museum in Krakow, where more than 600 sets of various ancient and folk costumes of Poland were displayed. At the same time, they also painted these national costumes into colored postcards, which were distributed in large quantities throughout the country, which played a great role in promoting and improving national costume styles. What is particularly worth mentioning here is the remarkable achievement of artists in developing folk art handicrafts. With the assistance of artists and art and craft schools, various folk handicrafts throughout the country, such as ceramics, wood carvings, weaving, and paper-cutting, have been processed and improved to become exquisite works of art and sold throughout the country. Every exquisite small decoration embodies the Polish people's love of beauty and patriotism.
    Poland's cultural and artistic circles regard the work of carrying forward national traditions in many ways and improving folk art with socialist spirit and patriotic spirit as a necessary means to enhance national self-confidence and pride, and as a necessary process to enable socialist culture to acquire national forms. They believe that the combination of socialism and national tradition is first expressed in literature and art, so major work must be carried out in literature and art to transform and improve people's thinking through it. They believe that folk art is an indivisible and important part of the entire national tradition. Folk art is basically progressive, but it also has backward elements, which must be analyzed and selected. Moreover, it must be improved to the level of national culture through correct sorting and processing. We have seen that Poland's cultural and artistic circles are carrying out unremitting labor according to these correct principles and have achieved remarkable results.
    In developing folk art and improving the people's culture with socialist spirit and patriotic spirit, the vigorous development of mass amateur art activities in Poland, like what we have seen in the Soviet Union, has also given us a very deep impression. Comrade Bierut said in his summary report on the work of the Central Committee at the Second Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party when talking about the development scale and importance of mass literature and art: "Amateur literature and art activities are developing rapidly. The number of workers' cultural troupes has increased from 4,803 in 1948 to 10,460 in 1953, and the number of rural cultural troupes has increased from 1,058 to 7,600. In 1953, workers' cultural troupes and rural cultural troupes performed a total of 152,000 performances, with an audience of 19 million. This huge mass movement is a powerful lever for the socialist cultural revolution in urban and rural areas, requiring the Party and Party organizations and organs to give constant and increasing care." Under the care and support of the Party and the government and the guidance of professional art groups, the level of mass art activities has improved rapidly. For example, in the Polish Modern Drama Festival held in 1951, 500,000 amateur actors and actresses from industry and agriculture participated in the performance. They participated in the competition with professional theater troupes, and excellent performances also received national prizes. As for amateur singing, dancing, chorus, and music performance in industry and agriculture, it is even more common. Under the demonstration and promotion of the Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble and other national song and dance ensembles, the mass singing attracts people's love with its strong national characteristics and a fairly high level. We saw the performance of the workers' amateur song and dance troupe in Krakow, had a get-together with active members of workers' amateur art in Nowa Huta and the Bytom mining area, and appreciated and had a get-together with the songs and dances of the people in the Zakopane mountain area. We saw how bright the flowers that can bloom once the artistic talents and creativity of the working people are encouraged.
    We believe that Poland's many successful experiences in cultural and artistic work are also worthy of our earnest learning.
    (III)
    During our Chinese cultural delegation's visit to Poland for more than a month, we personally witnessed the great and brilliant achievements of one of our beloved brotherly countries in economic and cultural construction, and felt unparalleled joy and excitement. It was with such joy and excitement that we celebrated the great festival of the tenth anniversary of Poland's liberation with the Polish people in Warsaw and Lublin. In the grand celebration held in Lublin, the heroic appearance of the Polish armed forces, the vigorous spirit of the Polish people shown in the mass parade, the people's trust and love for the United Workers' Party and Comrade Bierut, and the spiritual unity of the Polish people all gave us a very deep impression.
    During our stay in Poland, we personally experienced the friendship and love of the Polish people for the Chinese people, and realized that the friendship between China and Poland is developing and strengthening day by day. Not long ago, Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Poland was a major sign of the unbreakable brotherly friendship between China and Poland and the people of the two countries, and it was also a testament to the close cooperation between China and Poland in the struggle for world peace. During our stay in Warsaw, we also cheered enthusiastically with people from all walks of life in Warsaw for this major development in the friendly cooperative relations between our two countries.
    Cultural cooperation between China and Poland is also becoming closer day by day. The two countries exchange delegations, cultural troupes, and students, and hold exhibitions, report meetings, concerts, and film screenings for cultural exchange, which has played a great role in enhancing the friendship and mutual understanding between the two countries. Of course, we cannot be satisfied with our existing work. In this visit, we deeply felt that the work we have done in cultural exchange is still far from enough. For example, our translation and introduction of Polish literature and art is far from sufficient. On the other hand, the Polish people and literary and artistic circles are eager to further understand China and further understand our literature and art. In this regard, Poland's cultural and artistic circles have overcome difficulties and carried out valuable work. The responsible comrades of the Central Publishing Bureau of Poland told us that Poland has published 60 kinds of books and pamphlets introducing new China, including translations of Chairman Mao's works, our literary works, and publications they compiled to introduce new China. However, because our cultural circles have not taken the initiative to systematically introduce or provide information, the existing publications are far from meeting the Polish readers' desire. We believe that in the future, in the work of cultural exchange between the two countries, as with the cultural exchange with other brotherly countries, we should also carry out major work. As Premier Zhou said in his speech at the mass rally in Warsaw: "There is no doubt that the increasingly developing economic cooperation and cultural exchange will continuously strengthen and consolidate the friendship between the Chinese and Polish people. I firmly believe that the friendly cooperation between China and Poland in all aspects not only conforms to the interests of the people of our two countries, but also benefits the cause of world peace."

    向人民波兰学习
    中国访波文化代表团团长　阳翰笙
    （一）
    中国访波文化代表团应波兰政府的邀请，于六月二十九日抵华沙，八月三日离开波兰，经莫斯科返国，在波兰进行了一个多月的访问。代表团的成员包括诗人、作家、作曲家、歌唱家、戏剧家、美术家共七人。我们访问了人民波兰的首都华沙、古文化城克拉科夫及附近的新钢铁城。工业城市斯大林诺格罗德、革旦斯克海港和查库邦尼山区，参观了工厂、矿区、农庄、学校和许多文化艺术团体，看了许多艺术表演和展览，并和工厂、农村中的先进生产者及各地文化艺术界的著名人士多次举行座谈和个别谈话。我们亲眼看到人民波兰在经济建设和文化建设上所取得的巨大而辉煌的成就，亲身感受到波兰人民对我国人民的热烈的兄弟般的友爱。我们感到无比的兴奋，同时也学习了许多宝贵的东西。
    波兰在社会主义工业建设中的伟大成就，波兰工人阶级在提前完成国家六年建设计划的光荣劳动中所表现的英雄气概和爱国热情，给予我们很大的鼓舞。波兰社会主义工业化六年计划（一九五○—一九五五年）的进展速度是惊人的。以一九五三年为例，原计划一九五三年社会主义工业产值应达到一九四九年水平的百分之一百九十七点一，但在一九五三年即已达到百分之二百二十八点六，工业产量已发展为战前（一九三八年）的三点六倍，社会主义工业产值已占全部工业总产值的百分之九十九以上。正像贝鲁特同志在波兰统一工人党第二次代表大会上关于中央委员会工作的总结报告中所指出的：“国家的社会主义工业化的主要任务已基本上在一九五零年到一九五三年这段时期中顺利完成。波兰已从一个落后的农业国，从帝国主义国家的一个农业原料供应市场，变成了一个具有巨大的、日益增长的经济潜力的社会主义工业国”了。
    我们看到，在工厂和矿区，到处沸腾着劳动创造的热情。和各地斯达汉诺夫运动者的交谈，很使我们兴奋。像在华沙泽兰汽车厂，一位先进的青年工人领导着一个工具生产部门，使它一直成为工厂的先进部分；他自己完成生产计划的百分之三百。在贝多姆矿区，一位采煤工人在长期生产竞赛中，经常完成计划百分之二百，一九五二年已完成了自己在六年计划中的全部生产任务，明年一月将要提前完成他一九六一年的任务。这样动人的例子是不少的。特别使我们振奋的，是我们在克拉科夫附近参观了新建的钢铁城，那个被称为“诺瓦胡塔”的列宁冶金联合企业。四年前，那儿本是一片荒地。在苏联的大力援助下，波兰工人阶级经过四年的紧张的努力，如今，一个巨大的钢铁企业、欧洲最大的和最现代化的钢铁中心之一，奇迹般地耸立起来了。在钢铁厂附近，正在为工人们修建一个足以容纳十万居民的社会主义的新城市。我们参观了这个业已初步完工的钢铁厂和工人城，看见男女工人们在车间里，在起重机旁愉快地忘我地劳动着，看见“全波兰建设诺瓦胡塔”和“和平·贝鲁特”的巨幅标语，我们为波兰工人阶级的英雄气概和创造精神感到喜悦和骄傲。
    波兰的劳动农民也在农业的社会主义改造中贡献了自己的力量。农村的电气化和集体化已有很大进展。我们在革旦斯克省曾经参观了一个集体农庄，农民们兴奋地向我们谈到他们如何克服种种困难把农庄逐步发展起来，农庄如何在国家大力扶持与庄员们的忘我劳动下，使一九五三年的生产计划顺利完成：麦子百分之百，马铃薯百分之一百八十，肉类百分之三百五十，牛奶百分之八百。
    波兰人民的爱国精神和劳动热情，在重建华沙的过程中表现得最为鲜明。战争期间，法西斯匪徒在波兰特别是在华沙造成的灾害，是十分惨重的。希特勒扬言要把华沙从地图上抹去，美丽的华沙被毁成一片焦土。十年以来，波兰人民以极大的决心和毅力，从废墟上重建自己的首都。如今，一个新的华沙城业已巍然挺立起来，而且比过去更美丽更雄伟了。重建华沙的工作真是波兰社会主义建设的一个缩影，也是建设社会主义城市的一个卓越的范例。一方面尽量恢复旧日的美丽建筑和保存传统的民族风格，一方面又是按照每一所房屋都有现代化的设备和每一个区域都有学校、托儿所、医院、公园、电影院、百货店等最合理的设计进行的。重建华沙的胜利，不但对于波兰人民，而且对全世界爱好和平的人民都有着很大的鼓舞作用。华沙的工人们和知识分子们兴奋地向我们谈到他们曾经怎样参加了重建首都的工作，谈到在党和政府提出的“全国人民重建华沙”的口号的鼓舞下，全国各地的劳动人民和男女青年们如何成群结队地来到华沙参加光荣的义务劳动，都使我们深深地感动。
    波兰人民在建设祖国的工作中所表现的热烈的爱国精神和劳动精神，是值得我们学习的。
    （二）
    随着国家经济建设的飞速进展，波兰在文化教育上的成就也是巨大而显著的。目前，波兰已将五十岁以下居民中文盲现象消灭了。统一工人党提出的“不让一个孩子失学”的口号已充分实现。在普通中学中，工农青年占百分之六十一。高等学校里，工人青年占百分之三十四点一，农民青年占百分之二十五。全国每一万人中有四十七个大学生。解放以来，人民的文化水平已显著提高。
    波兰的文化艺术界在统一工人党和波兰政府的领导扶植下，一方面大力普及社会主义的新文化，鼓励文学艺术的新创作；同时大力发扬自己优秀的民族传统和普遍开展民间艺术活动，以提高人民的爱国精神和民族自豪感。这些工作，都已收到巨大的成效。
    据一九五三年的统计，全国报纸的发行总数已达十五亿份，杂志发行总数三亿五千二百万份，书籍和小册子的发行额超过九千万份；文学作品销数最高者达百万册以上。一九五三年全国戏剧观众约一千二百五十万人次，电影观众一亿五千二百万人次。以波兰的人口（现为二千六百五十余万人）而论，这些数字，很足以说明新文化普及的程度了。
    波兰的社会主义现实主义的文学艺术，在反对资产阶级影响和反对公式化的斗争中，已奠定良好的基础。党和政府对发展新的文学艺术创作，采取了以鼓励为主的方针。政府对优秀的文学、音乐、美术创作，戏剧、音乐、歌舞演出，艺术科学论著及艺术上的其他创造性的活动（如美术家在协助重建华沙古城的艺术设计，专业剧团辅导业余艺术活动等）每年均颁发国家奖金。最近举行过的庆祝波兰国家复兴节十周年典礼上，有不少作家、艺术家获得国家奖章。在作家和艺术家自觉的劳动精神和国家的奖励之下，作家的写作劲头很高，文学艺术创作与演出日益呈现活跃的气象。我们在华沙及各城市会见不少的诗人、作家、作曲家、画家、导演等，他们每个人都有具体的创作计划，并且都是那样热爱自己的事业，那样聚精会神地从事创造性的劳动，力求把自己的聪明才智贡献给祖国和人民。
    波兰文化艺术界对整理与发扬自己民族的优良的文化传统，进行了系统的、广泛而深入的工作。波兰人民非常敬爱自己民族以往的文化名人，像哥白尼、萧邦、米茨凯维奇及著名的画家、戏剧家，均树立其铜像，保存其故居，推广其著作并建立纪念馆。我们在华沙期间，曾经参观了波兰文艺复兴时期展览会中的哥白尼馆，参观了米茨凯维奇纪念馆，拜访了萧邦的故居，对波兰人民及其杰出的天才在人类进步文化中的卓越贡献，表示了我们的仰慕之忱。据我们所知道的，自一九四五年波兰国务会议决议出版诗人米茨凯维奇的全部著作以来，到一九五三年共印行了三百八十五万册，其中“塔杜须先生”一书（我国已有译本）已印行一百六十多万册。萧邦的作品已全部灌成唱片，电台每两三天举行一次萧邦音乐会，萧邦故居每星期日举行萧邦音乐演奏会，故居虽在离城数十公里的地方，每次听众仍有三四千人。波兰政府现为组织国际萧邦钢琴比赛，在格丹斯克乡间集中了大批钢琴家加紧研究学习，现已形成学习萧邦的热潮。此外，戏剧界对十九世纪的斯洛瓦茨基等大戏剧家，美术界对前世纪的马泰科等大画家，也都进行了系统的研究工作，并且以各种方式对广大人民进行宣传。
    波兰的艺术家们在整理古代艺术遗产和整理民间艺术的工作上，付出了重大的努力。国立艺术科学院根据历年研究的成果，正在编纂“波兰音乐百科全书”、“波兰美术百科全书”、“波兰戏剧史”等。该院所属的民间音乐研究所，派专人在全国各地系统地搜集民歌，包括曲调、歌调及其地理风俗背景，现已记录了民歌及民间音乐六万首。波兰的美术家、建筑家们在研究波兰古代的和民间的建筑样式、发展建筑与建筑装饰的民族形式方面，也获得了杰出的成就。华沙古城的中世纪建筑与新城的文艺复兴式建筑的恢复工作，就是很好的范例，一批美术家且因此获得了国家奖金。此外，在研究民族服装上，美术家们也做得很有成绩。我们曾在克拉科夫参观了一个博物馆中的服装展览馆，其中所陈列波兰古代的和民间的各式各样的服装，就有六百余套之多。同时，他们又把这些民族服装都绘制成彩色明信片，在全国大量发行，这对于提倡和改进民族服装式样，是起了很大的作用的。这里还特别值得一提的，是美术家们在发展民间美术工艺品上的显著成就。在美术家和美术工艺学校的协助下，全国各地的各种民间手工艺品，如陶瓷、木雕、编织、剪纸等都经过加工提高，变成精致的美术品在全国发卖。在每一件精致的小摆设上面，也都体现了波兰人民的爱美心和爱国心。
    波兰的文化艺术界把多方面地发扬民族传统与提高民间艺术的工作，看成是提高民族自信心与自豪感的必要手段，看成是使社会主义文化获得民族形式的必要过程。他们认为，社会主义和民族传统的结合，首先在文学艺术上表现出来，因此在文学艺术上要进行重大的工作，通过它来改造和提高人民的思想。他们认为，民间艺术是整个民族传统的不可分割的重要部分。民间艺术基本上是进步的，但也有落后的成分，必须加以分析选择。并且，必须通过正确的整理加工，把民间文化提高到民族文化的水平。我们看到，波兰的文化艺术界正是根据这些正确的原则进行着不倦的劳动，并已获得显著成效。
    在发展民间艺术和以社会主义精神与爱国主义精神提高人民文化的工作上，波兰群众业余艺术活动的蓬勃开展，也像我们曾经在苏联看到的那样，给了我们非常深刻的印象。贝鲁特同志在波兰统一工人党第二次代表大会上所作的关于中央委员会工作的总结报告中，谈到群众文艺的发展规模及其重要意义时说：“业余文艺活动正在迅速地发展着。工人文工团由一九四八年的四千八百零三个增加到一九五三年的一万零四百六十个，乡村文工团由一千零五十八个增加到七千六百个。一九五三年工人文工团及乡村文工团共演出十五万二千场，观众一千九百万。这个巨大的群众运动是城乡社会主义文化革命的强大杠杆，要求党及党的组织和机关给予经常不断的、日益增加的关心。”在党和政府的关怀扶持和专业艺术团体的辅导下，群众艺术活动的水平提高得很快。例如一九五一年举行的波兰现代戏剧会演，就有五十万工农业余演员参加演出，他们和职业剧团一同参加比赛，优秀的演出也同样得到国家奖金。至于工农业余的歌舞、合唱和音乐演奏，更是非常普遍。在玛佐夫舍歌舞团和其他国家歌舞团的示范推动之下，群众的演唱以其浓厚的民族色彩和相当高的水平吸引人们的热爱。我们在克拉科夫曾经看到工人业余歌舞团的演出，在诺瓦胡塔和贝多姆矿区曾和工人业余艺术的积极分子联欢，在查库邦尼山区，曾欣赏了山区人民的歌舞并和他们联欢。我们看到，劳动人民的艺术才能和创造性一旦被鼓舞起来之后，可以开放出多么鲜艳的花朵。
    我们认为，波兰在文化艺术工作的许多成功的经验，也都是值得我们切实学习的。
    （三）
    我们中国文化代表团这次在波兰一个多月的参观访问，亲眼看到我们亲爱的兄弟国家之一在经济建设和文化建设上所获得的巨大而辉煌的成就，感到无比的喜悦和兴奋。正是带着这样喜悦和兴奋的心情，我们在华沙和卢布林和波兰人民一道欢度了波兰解放十周年的伟大节日。在卢布林举行的庆祝盛典中，波兰武装部队的英姿焕发，从群众游行队伍中表现出来的波兰人民的蓬勃的朝气，人民对统一工人党和贝鲁特同志的信任和热爱，以及波兰全国人民在精神上的团结一致，都给予我们十分深刻的印象。
    我们在波兰期间，亲身体会到波兰人民对中国人民的友谊和热爱，体会到中波两国的友谊正在一天天地发展和加强着。不久以前，周恩来总理的访问波兰，正是中波两国和两国人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊的重大发展的标志，也是中波两国在为世界和平的斗争中亲密合作的明证。我们在华沙期间，也曾和华沙各界人民一同为我们两国友谊合作关系的这一重大发展而热烈欢呼。
    中波两国间的文化合作也一天比一天密切。两国互派代表团、文工团、留学生，为文化交流而互相举办展览会、报告会、演奏会和电影放映等，对增进两国的友谊和相互了解，起了很大作用。当然，我们不能满足于我们现有的工作。在这次访问中，我们深切感觉到，我们在文化交流中所做的工作还是非常不够的。举例来说，我们对波兰文学艺术的翻译介绍，就做得很不够。另一方面，波兰人民和文学艺术界渴望进一步了解中国，进一步了解我国的文学艺术，在这方面，波兰的文化艺术界曾经克服困难，进行了有价值的工作。波兰的中央出版局的负责同志告诉我们，波兰出版的介绍新中国的书籍小册子，已达六十种，其中包括翻译的毛主席的著作、我国的文学作品以及他们编写的介绍新中国的出版物。可是，由于我国文化界主动地系统地进行介绍或提供资料的工作做得很不够，已有的出版物，还远不能满足波兰读者的渴望。我们认为，今后在两国文化交流的工作上，和对各兄弟国家的文化交流一样，我们还应当进行重大的工作。正像周总理在华沙群众大会上的讲话所说：“毫无疑问，日益发展的经济合作和文化交流将使中波两国人民的友谊不断地加强和巩固。我深信，中波两国在各方面的友好合作不仅符合于我们两国人民的利益，而且也是有利于世界和平事业的。”
