The People's Reception Office of the Qianmen District People's Court in Beijing has played a role in facilitating people's litigation and supervising the work of the court, and is welcomed by the people.

The People's Reception Office of the Qianmen District People's Court was established in July of last year, with a litigation reception group and a people's opinions handling group. When people have disputes and come to the reception office, they are handled by the litigation reception group. The reception office can help resolve urgent cases or simple disputes in which both parties are present in a timely manner. For cases where only the plaintiff is present or where an investigation is required, the reception office staff will schedule the next reception time, notify the defendant, and immediately conduct an investigation. In this way, this type of case can also be resolved as soon as possible. According to statistics, from its establishment to June of this year, the People's Reception Office of the Qianmen District People's Court handled a total of 1,237 simple civil disputes and minor criminal cases, of which 633 were closed within three days. Shi Qingchang, a merchant from Dingxian County, Hebei Province, wrote a letter to the People's Reception Office of the Qianmen District Court, requesting assistance in resolving the issue because Gu Tongming, a merchant from Beijing, had not repaid the payment for goods that were overdue. After receiving the letter, the reception office investigated the situation and quickly resolved the problem, and remitted the full amount of 145,000 yuan to Shi Qingchang. Sometimes, when people have difficult questions, they also write letters or come to the People's Reception Office to inquire at any time. In the past year, the People's Opinions Handling Group of the Qianmen District People's Court People's Reception Office has answered people's inquiries 795 times. The staff of this group are very patient in answering questions and make sure every issue is addressed. In addition, the reception office often writes lawsuits or takes statements for litigants who cannot write lawsuits. According to statistics, the reception office wrote more than 550 lawsuits for litigants in one year.

The people of Qianmen District have supervised the work of the court by writing letters and visiting the reception office, so that the work of the court can be improved in a timely manner. According to statistics, the People's Reception Office has handled a total of 370 letters from the people and received 5,557 visits from the people in the past year. Some of these were criticisms of the court for delaying the execution of cases. These opinions have attracted the attention of the court leadership. Now the court has established an execution group under the trial court, and the execution work after the judgment, which was scattered in various units, is concentrated in the execution group for unified handling. From the establishment of the execution group in August last year to June this year, more than 700 execution cases have been cleared.

The People's Reception Office of the Qianmen District People's Court also pays attention to conducting law-abiding education for the people, preventing and reducing disputes. In addition to displaying various legal books and periodicals in the reception office, and posting eye-catching colored paper with the full text of the Marriage Law, graphic explanations of "From Filing a Lawsuit to Closing a Case" and introductions to litigation procedures, as well as judgments of some typical cases on the wall, the People's Reception Office staff are always very patient and meticulous when answering questions and pay attention to attracting others to listen. After listening to the explanation of policies and regulations, some people gave up their original intention of filing a lawsuit, and some, after filing a lawsuit, understood the policies and regulations due to the patient explanation of the reception office cadres and voluntarily requested to withdraw the lawsuit. According to statistics, from the establishment of the People's Reception Office to June of this year, there were 875 cases of non-prosecution after reception and explanation, which reduced litigation.

    北京前门区法院人民接待室受到群众欢迎
    北京市前门区人民法院人民接待室起了便利群众诉讼和监督法院工作的作用，受到人民欢迎。
    前门区人民法院人民接待室是在去年七月建立的，下设诉讼接待组和人民意见处理组。人民有了纠纷到接待室，由诉讼接待组接待办理。接待室对于紧急案件或情节简单、当事人双方在场的纠纷案件，都能及时帮助解决。对于只有原告一方或须进行调查的案件，接待室工作人员就预约好下一次接待时间，同时通知被告，并立即进行调查。这样，这一类情况的案件，也能尽快得到解决。据统计，前门区人民法院人民接待室从成立到今年六月止，共处理了一千二百三十七件简易民事纠纷和轻微刑事案件，其中三天内结案的就有六百三十三件。河北省定县商人史庆昌，因北京商人顾同明过期不还货款，就写一封信给前门区法院人民接待室，要求帮助解决。接待室收到信后，查明情况，很快就把问题解决了，并把全部货款十四万五千元邮汇给史庆昌。有时人民有疑难问题，也随时写信或亲到人民接待室询问。一年来，前门区法院人民接待室的人民意见处理组共解答了人民询问七百九十五次，这个组的工作人员在解答问题时很耐心，还做到了件件有交代。此外，接待室经常给不会写诉状的诉讼当事人，代写诉状或录口供。据统计，一年中接待室为诉讼人代写的诉状有五百五十多件。
    前门区人民通过向接待室写信、访问，监督了法院的工作，使法院工作能及时得到改进。据统计，一年来人民接待室共处理了人民来信三百七十件，接待人民来访五千五百五十七次。其中有一些是批评法院对案件拖延执行的意见。这些意见引起了法院领导方面的注意。现在法院已在审判庭下面设立了执行组，把分散在各单位的判决后的执行工作集中到执行组统一清理。从去年八月设立执行组到今年六月止，共清理了七百多件执行案。
    前门区人民法院人民接待室还注意对人民群众进行守法教育，预防和减少了纠纷。人民接待室除在接待室中陈列了各种法律书籍和报刊，墙上张贴着醒目色纸写的婚姻法全文、“从起诉到结案”诉讼手续介绍等图表说明，以及一些典型案件的判决书以外，每当向问事人解答问题时，接待室工作人员总是十分耐心细致，并且注意吸引他人旁听。有的群众在听了政策法令的讲解后，就打消了原来起诉的念头，有的在起诉后因接待室干部的耐心解释，懂得了政策法令，自动提出撤销诉讼。据统计，从人民接待室成立到今年六月止，经接待解释后不起诉的有八百七十五件，减少了诉讼。
