Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, 18th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the issue of the French Union forces transferring Hanoi to the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was initiated by the delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army and the delegation of the General Command of the French Union Forces at the meeting of the Vietnam Central Joint Ceasefire Committee on the 15th.

Both sides have appointed expert sub-committees comprised of military, administrative, and police personnel to study the transfer of the city. This sub-committee began work on the 16th and is currently discussing the issue of the Vietnam People's Army dispatching public security teams to Hanoi first, as stipulated in the ceasefire agreement.

Hanoi is a densely populated city with many foreign nationals, public institutions, and factories. The Vietnam International Supervisory and Control Commission is also located in the center of the city. At the same time, Hanoi is the first major city that the French government must transfer to the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam under the ceasefire agreement.

Recently, many public properties in Hanoi have been transferred or destroyed. Public order in the city is seriously jeopardized. The delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army has requested the French Union Forces to take necessary measures in accordance with the Geneva Accords to end this regrettable situation.

In order to ensure that the transfer of Hanoi is carried out in good order, namely: to ensure the integrity of public institutions, factories and public properties, to ensure the normal operation of all affairs, to ensure that public order in the city is not disrupted, to ensure the normal life of the people, and to provide all conveniences for the International Supervisory and Control Commission; the delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army has repeatedly emphasized since September 7th the need to discuss and resolve the transfer of Hanoi. On the 15th, the delegation of the General Command of the French Union Forces agreed to begin discussions on this issue.

    越法双方代表团开始讨论移交河内问题
    【新华社十九日讯】据越南通讯社北越十八日讯：关于法兰西联邦部队将河内移交给越南民主共和国政府的问题，已由越南人民军总司令部代表团和法兰西联邦部队总司令部代表团在十五日的越南中央联合停战委员会会议上开始讨论。
    双方已指派军事、行政和警察专家组成小组委员会，研究城市的移交问题。这个小组委员会从十六日起开始工作，目前正在讨论停战协定中所规定的由越南人民军先派遣公安队到河内的问题。
    河内是一个人口稠密的城市，有许多外国侨民、公共机关和工厂，越南国际监察和监督委员会也设在这个城市的中心。同时，河内也是法国政府按照停战协定必须移交给越南民主共和国政府的第一个大城市。
    近来，河内的许多公共财产被转移或被破坏了。城市的治安受到严重的危害。越南人民军总司令部代表团已要求法兰西联邦部队按照日内瓦协定采取必要的措施来结束这种令人遗憾的情况。
    为使河内的移交工作在良好的秩序中进行，即：保证公共机关、工厂和公共财产完整无损，保证一切事务正常进行，保证城市治安不受破坏，保证人民生活正常，以及为国际监察和监督委员会提供一切便利；越南人民军总司令部代表团从九月七日以来就一再强调有必要来讨论并解决河内的移交问题。十五日，法兰西联邦部队总司令部代表团同意开始讨论这个问题。
