At the first session of the First National People's Congress, representatives discussed the draft constitution and reports. Below are the speeches from several representatives:

**Lin Boqu's Speech**

Comrades and Representatives:

The First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China is about to solemnly adopt the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. This is a great event for our country, a great event for the entire nation, and a great event for all our friends around the world.

This Constitution is a summary of the victories of the Chinese people's revolution against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism over the past century, especially the past thirty years. It is a summary of the experience of nation-building since the founding of the People's Republic of China. It is a guarantee that our country will build a socialist society through a peaceful path.

In the process of drafting this Constitution, people of all ethnic groups in China have enthusiastically participated in the discussion. It is a combination of the experiences of the leaders and the broad masses of the people, and a combination of the experiences of China and the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries.

The draft Constitution stipulates that all power in the People's Republic of China belongs to the people, and that the organs through which the people exercise their power are the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at various levels. It stipulates that the National People's Congress is the highest organ of state power and the sole organ exercising legislative power. It stipulates that the National People's Congress, local people's congresses at various levels, and other state organs all practice the system of democratic centralism. It stipulates that people's representatives are supervised by their original electoral units and voters. It stipulates that all personnel of state organs must strive to serve the people. It stipulates that the state's armed forces belong to the people, and their task is to defend the fruits of the people's revolution and national construction, to defend the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and security of the state.

The various parts of the draft Constitution are all imbued with the spirit of equality, friendship, mutual assistance, and cooperation among the various nationalities within the country. All these regulations concerning political and state systems are summaries of the actual experiences of China's political life, now fixed in legal form.

The draft Constitution points out that our country is in a historical period of gradually transitioning to a socialist society, reflecting the fundamental requirements of our country in the transitional period and the common aspirations of the people of the whole country to build a socialist society. It stipulates the general tasks of the state in the transitional period, points out the internal and external conditions for achieving the general tasks, and stipulates the path for the Chinese people to strive for these goals. These stipulations are all based on the current social situation of China. Due to the leadership of the Chinese working class and the efforts of the broad laboring masses, the socialist factors in the political and economic aspects of the country have already become the decisive leading force, which determines that the gradual transition to a socialist society is an inevitable trend of our country's existence and development; at the same time, due to the large existence of non-socialist economic components and the fact that the development of the socialist economy cannot keep up with the needs of the broad masses, the transformation of the various existing non-socialist ownership systems must be carried out gradually and differently. Only by guaranteeing the priority development of state-owned economy, that is, the socialist economy of full public ownership, can the leading force in the national economy be strengthened and the material foundation for the realization of socialist transformation be expanded. Only by relying on state organs to take specific administrative measures and combining them with the socialist consciousness and active actions of the broad masses can the socialist transformation be gradually realized, gradually eliminate the system of exploitation, and build a socialist society. Over the past few years, we have been following these principles to proceed. This is a summary of the actual experiences of the economic life of the Chinese people, now also fixed in legal form.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the great achievements of various measures have already brought profound and fundamental changes to the entire Chinese society in all aspects. The material and cultural living standards of the people have significantly improved compared to before liberation, and the various freedoms and rights of the people have begun to be guaranteed materially. However, we are still a new country that has just been established from the ruins of the old, impoverished, and backward China, and our socialist construction and socialist transformation are just beginning to be carried out in a planned manner. The accumulation of national wealth is still not sufficient. Therefore, it can be said that at present, our country's material guarantees for the various basic rights of citizens are still insufficient. It should be pointed out that developing economic construction is the prerequisite for improving people's lives, and the view that ignores the interests of economic construction and demands the improvement of people's lives too high and too urgently is incorrect; it should also be pointed out that among the personnel of our state organs, there are still some people who adopt a bureaucratic and indifferent attitude towards improving people's lives under possible conditions, and even violate laws and discipline, infringing upon the basic rights of the people, which is also wrong and must be resolutely opposed.

People of all ethnic groups across the country, whether in factories, in rural areas, in schools, in government agencies, or in other positions, are enthusiastically welcoming the birth of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China with actual actions. We firmly believe that under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, after the people have their own Constitution, the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses will be further unleashed. We must unite with the people of the whole country to continue to strengthen unity and strive to thoroughly accomplish the general tasks of the state in the transitional period, and build our country into a great socialist state!

**Li Jishen's Speech**

Chairman, Comrades and Representatives:

I fully agree with the "Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China" and fully agree with the report on the draft Constitution by Comrade Liu Shaoqi. At this moment, my heart is filled with excitement. I cannot help but think of the countless patriots who have struggled and shed their blood over the past hundred years. Today, we, representing the 600 million people of the nation, solemnly adopt the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, which shows that the struggles of our revolutionary forerunners and the modern Chinese people's revolutionary struggle have achieved great victories.

This draft Constitution has been drafted by more than 8,000 representatives from various sectors, and a high tide of enthusiastic discussions has been set off across the vast land. It has gathered the wisdom and opinions of the entire Chinese people. Its entire content and every clause are imbued with the true spirit of democracy; it summarizes the experiences of the past and present revolutionary struggles, pointing out an irrefutable truth: that China can only take the socialist path.

However, socialism is not something we can achieve by sitting and waiting. In the past few years, we have achieved remarkable achievements in all aspects, which is a fact that no one can deny. But there are also shortcomings and mistakes in our work. For example, in state organs, some officials are detached from the masses and violate laws and discipline, damaging the government's prestige. Again, in construction projects, due to lack of thorough investigation and research, lack of meticulous planning, or rashness and recklessness, causing losses to the state, these shortcomings and mistakes, no matter how small or individual, must be corrected in the future.

What is legal and must be executed? What is illegal and must be prohibited? The draft Constitution has clearly stipulated this. Therefore, after we formulate the Constitution, the first requirement is to strictly abide by the Constitution and actively execute the Constitution. The Constitution is our powerful weapon. We should use it to defend and develop the fruits of victory, and use it to overcome and eliminate all errors and shortcomings. Therefore, I suggest launching a nationwide campaign to study and publicize the Constitution, so that everyone can abide by the Constitution, execute the Constitution, accept socialist transformation, raise political awareness, overcome individualism, and wholeheartedly follow the Communist Party forever.

The Constitution gives us full rights and entrusts us with heavy responsibilities. First, I think of the territory of Taiwan, which is occupied by the United States. As long as Taiwan is not liberated, our territory will not be complete, and the security of China and the peace of the world will be threatened. Today, we cannot help but feel regret that there are no representatives of the people of Taiwan Province elected by universal suffrage present. We cannot help but think of our People's Liberation Army fighting bravely on the front lines. The residents along our coastal frontiers and the fishermen in the Taiwan Strait are constantly being bombed and massacred by the Kuomintang bandits. We must never forget that there are still eight million compatriots suffering under the oppression of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek. To defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity and security of the state, we must liberate Taiwan!

I speak here with full confidence. We have the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao, and the consolidated and still effective people's democratic united front. This Constitution of the people of the whole country building socialism will definitely be fully realized. As Chairman Mao pointed out at the opening of the conference, we will definitely be able to build our country into a great socialist republic.

**Wang Chonglun's Speech**

Chairman, Comrades and Representatives:

I am honored to participate in the National People's Congress and discuss the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China. In our draft Constitution, it is stipulated that citizens have the right to labor, and laborers have the right to rest, and that labor is an honorable thing. It stipulates the leading position of the working class and the goal of struggling to build socialism, which consolidates the fruits of the Chinese people's past struggles and points out the bright path for the future. I firmly support this draft Constitution and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the political and social status of workers in our country has undergone fundamental changes. We workers have become masters of the country, and we are working to build our own happy lives. Because we are working for ourselves and our country, our enthusiasm is especially high, production efficiency is continuously improving, and our lives are also improving. These are my personal experiences. Under the education and cultivation of the Party, I and my fellow workers across the country, like me, have seen the beautiful prospects of socialism, recognized the great responsibility of the working class, and made up our minds to study hard and contribute all our strength to the motherland and the cause of socialism.

My fellow workers across the country have made great achievements on the production front, but the construction of the country needs us to make even more achievements; and to make more achievements, we must rely on the leadership of the Party and the strength of the collective. Without the leadership of the Party and collective spirit, individual strength is very limited. In my work, I have made some contributions, but I have also encountered many difficulties. Without the leadership of the Party and the help of everyone, I would not be able to overcome these difficulties. The Party always reminds me: difficulties are tests, perseverance is victory, and with determination, success is possible. The leadership also specially made resolutions to help me, and the elder workers and technical personnel were very enthusiastic in assisting me, so the "universal tool holder" was successfully created under the collective strength, and work efficiency was increased by six times. I think that the tens of thousands of technical innovators across the country also achieved success under the leadership of the Party and the help of everyone. Obviously, these achievements created by collective wisdom would not have happened in the old society and could only happen after the people became the masters of the state. This fully demonstrates the superiority of the people's democratic system.

I have one suggestion to make here. I deeply feel that too many social activities are a heavy burden on labor models. Too many social activities reduce the time for production and study, and in this way, models will not remain models for long. I think that fellow labor and agricultural models will have similar feelings. I hope that the government, trade unions, and other relevant departments can appropriately solve this problem.

The formulation of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China will make our people's democratic system more complete and consolidated. In the future, we must further raise our awareness, abide by labor discipline, give full play to our initiative and creativity, ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the state plan, ensure the implementation of the Constitution, and pledge to struggle to the end for the liberation of Taiwan!

**Zhang Lan's Speech**

Chairman, Comrades and Representatives:

I fully agree with the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft Constitution.

Over the past sixty years, I have personally experienced the constitutional movement in China. From my own experience, the so-called constitutionalism of the past reactionary rulers, from the process of drafting the constitution to the content of the "constitution," was all deceptive and was therefore despised and opposed by the people.

Due to the victory of the new democratic revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have embarked on the path of light and happiness; today, we have this truly democratic constitution. This constitution was produced in a democratic manner, from the Central People's Government Committee to every corner of the country, it has undergone many discussions, absorbed all good opinions, and truly achieved perfection. Therefore, this constitution is in line with the common aspirations of the broad masses and is unanimously supported and enthusiastically endorsed by the people of the whole country.

The Constitution of the People's Republic of China was not easily obtained. After obtaining this constitution, the people of the whole country must make greater efforts to build a new socialist society in our great motherland.

To thoroughly implement this constitution, the efforts of the people of the whole country are needed. First of all, a nationwide campaign to publicize and study the constitution should be launched to ensure that everyone knows about it. The constitution is the fundamental law of the state. From the central government to the local governments, from the government to the people, everyone must strictly abide by it and jointly uphold it. We, the representatives of the First National People's Congress, have personally participated in this solemn constitutional conference and should set an example by strictly abiding by the constitution and taking on the heavy responsibility of supervising the implementation of the constitution. The various democratic classes, democratic parties, and people's organizations led by the Chinese Communist Party should all take responsibility to ensure the thorough implementation of the constitution.

Over the past five years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our country has made brilliant achievements in politics, economy, and culture. However, it must be admitted that there are still some shortcomings and mistakes in our various works. It is precisely because of this that in the past few years, we have been constantly fighting against bureaucracy, commandism, and lawlessness. Now that the constitution has been promulgated, all personnel of state organs must take the constitution as the standard, overcome these shortcomings and mistakes, and work diligently for the people.

When the people of the whole country are enthusiastically celebrating the promulgation of the constitution, I especially think of the Taiwanese compatriots who are still suffering. The people of the whole country must unite more strongly to liberate Taiwan, eliminate the Kuomintang bandits, defend the integrity of the territory, and will not allow the interference of the American aggression group!

**Han En's Speech**

Chairman, Comrades and Representatives:

The convening of the National People's Congress to adopt the Constitution of the People's Republic of China is a great event for our people. I am very happy to be able to participate in such an important conference as a representative. Farmers participating in the management of state affairs and the formulation of the state constitution is something that has never happened before. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, can we farmers have such a good day today.

I am the director of the Ba'an Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jilin Province. Last winter, when we farmers learned about the general tasks of the state in the transitional period, our production enthusiasm was even higher. The light of socialism has illuminated everyone's hearts. We have seen with our own eyes that many large factories are under construction, new agricultural tools and chemical fertilizers are increasingly being delivered to the countryside, and we have heard that tractor factories are also being built. In the future, farming with machines will be like what we have seen in many state farms, deep plowing, good growth, and more grain will be harvested.

In June this year, after the draft Constitution was published, we farmers discussed this draft Constitution, and our production enthusiasm was even greater. The Constitution consolidates the fruits of our country's revolutionary victories and land reform, and the Constitution also guarantees that our country will gradually transition to socialism. The Constitution stipulates that developing cooperatives is the main path to transform individual agriculture, which fully represents the wishes of the broad masses of farmers. To make everyone prosperous, we must take the path of cooperation, and this point we farmers are increasingly understanding. Our Ba'an Village was once famous for being a "poor stick village." The Communist Party came, the farmers divided the land, and organized mutual aid teams. By 1952, agricultural production cooperatives were established. Although we suffered a disaster that year, the cooperative still ensured a good harvest; so more farmers wanted to join, and by the end of the year, it developed to 47 households. Now our cooperative has developed to 107 households, with 160 mu of water and dry fields, equivalent to 2,400 mu in the interior, and this year we can harvest 12 million jin of grain. We calculate: after paying 130,000 jin of public grain, leaving seeds for next year and the grain for the members to eat, we can still sell 700,000 jin of grain to the state. This year we have already sold 20,000 eggs and 12,000 jin of pork to the state at fair and reasonable prices, and after the autumn harvest, we will sell another 7,000 jin of pork and 5,000 jin of beef to the state.

In the two years since the establishment of our cooperative, we have planted more than 4,000 fruit trees and more than 100,000 ordinary trees, built a one-mu fish pond, and released 20,000 fish fry. Because production has developed, the income of the members has increased year by year, and life has improved year by year; just the houses that the members live in, 40 new ones have been built in the past two years, and the public granary and livestock shed of the cooperative are not included. The cultural level of the members has also improved, and generally, members can recognize 300-500 characters and are still continuing to study. Like our agricultural production cooperative, there are many in Jilin Province, and there are even more across the country. However, our cooperative still has many shortcomings. We have not fully utilized the functions of new agricultural tools; although the amount of fertilizer is large, the quality is poor; some old members are not enthusiastic about absorbing poor households to join the cooperative when expanding the cooperative. We still need to learn from other cooperatives to make our cooperative better and further develop production.

These benefits are all thanks to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao leading us to drive out imperialism, defeat the Kuomintang reactionaries, distribute land, and organize mutual aid and cooperation. They are also inseparable from the help of the worker big brothers and the development of industry. Therefore, we farmers enthusiastically support this constitution that guarantees the construction of socialism; after the conference adopts this constitution, we will definitely use our labor and production to guarantee the realization of the goals set by this constitution as soon as possible.

**Xiao Longyou's Speech**

I feel extremely honored to be elected as a representative. Our country has had several constitutions in the past, but they were all for the convenience of the government, that is, for the landlord class and the bourgeoisie to serve, to deceive the people. They never considered equality, freedom, and mutual benefit among all ethnic groups. This time, all the representatives of the National People's Congress are truly elected from the will of the people. For the realization of equality, freedom, and mutual benefit among all ethnic groups, and to become a big family, all the rules and systems of mutual assistance and mutual benefit are included in the constitution, and the development of health and medicine is explained in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions. I, as a person in the medical field, am willing to follow the medical practitioners of China and the West to combine our country's precious cultural heritage with science and sort it out, so that our country's medicine, which has thousands of years of clinical experience, can be developed and prospered, so that all the laboring people in our country can enjoy the right to health care. The method I advocate is that we must simultaneously establish a Chinese medicine university and a Chinese medicine hospital, so that learning and clinical practice can have experience at the same time, otherwise it will not be easy to achieve good results. This is my main suggestion, and other matters can be supplemented at the meeting, so that Chinese and Western medicine can exchange, so that people's health can be improved, and together we can strive for the construction of the country. However, this constitution can be trusted as the constitution that the people of the whole country will jointly abide by and implement, which is also a sacred and inviolable constitution. I hope that we representatives and the people of the whole country will respect it together. I am a person in the medical field, so I speak like this, and I hope everyone will give me some advice.

**Lin Feng's Speech**

Chairman, Comrades and Representatives:

I fully support the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China and fully agree with Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on behalf of the Constitution Drafting Committee of the People's Republic of China to the conference.

The draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China summarizes the long-term revolutionary struggle experience of the Chinese people, points out the way forward for the people of the whole country, stipulates the general policies and tasks of our country's transition to a socialist society, and gives the people of the whole country unlimited confidence and strength. The draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China has been discussed by the people of the whole country, gathered the wisdom of the people of the whole country, and fully expressed the common aspirations of the Chinese people to build a socialist society. We are convinced that the adoption and promulgation of this draft Constitution will be enthusiastically supported by the people of the whole country.

Our constitution is a democratic constitution, a constitution to build our country into a socialist society. I think that, based on the spirit of the draft Constitution, it is meaningful to look at the construction of the Northeast region. In recent years, the Northeast region, like other regions in the country, under the correct leadership and care of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, with the support of the whole country, the help of the Soviet Union, and the efforts of all laboring people, has overcome many difficulties, done a lot of work, and made great progress in various construction projects. In terms of industrial construction, we have already built or are building many new enterprises, gradually producing new products that our country could not produce in the past. In 1953, the total industrial output value of the Northeast region was 444.8% of that in 1949, and the proportion of large-scale industrial output value in the total industrial and agricultural output value increased from 37.6% in 1949 to 61.2% in 1953. In terms of agricultural production, there has also been some improvement, and the proportion of agricultural production mutual aid and cooperative organizations reached 73.8% of the total households in 1953. Other construction projects have also developed accordingly. The situation in the Northeast region fully demonstrates the superiority of the people's democratic system led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants, and also proves that the Chinese people can successfully complete the great historical task of socialist industrialization and socialist transformation of our country. However, based on the spirit of the draft Constitution, if we examine the work of the Northeast region, we can see that there are many shortcomings and mistakes, which mainly manifest in the fact that the implementation of the people's democratic system and the promotion of democracy are not sufficient enough, and the political work and ideological education work for the masses and cadres, especially the combination of political work and economic work, are not done well enough. The work of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is also not paid enough attention to. Some of our cadres, especially a few leading cadres, still have serious arrogance and complacency, and some even think of themselves as "advanced" and "special," criticizing and inspecting the work they lead is not allowed, and they do not learn from other regions' experiences with humility or attention. These mistakes, although they have been strictly criticized and stopped, still need to be further overcome and corrected in future work. To successfully complete the task of socialist industrialization and socialist transformation of our country, we must unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party and the government of the People's Republic of China, seriously implement all the principles stipulated in the draft Constitution, especially rely on the masses, promote democracy, further implement the people's democratic system; strengthen the idea of centralized and unified leadership, strengthen the concept of the whole and the concept of the state, and obey the unified construction plan of the state. All forms of decentralization and localism must be opposed and corrected in a timely manner.

Comrades and representatives! Our motherland is advancing towards a happy socialist society, our future is bright, but our task is arduous. We must follow the instructions of Chairman Mao, be humble and prudent, maintain close ties with the masses, learn humbly, first learn from the Soviet Union, and strive to overcome all obstacles and shortcomings in the work on the way forward, to ensure the implementation of the Constitution, to successfully complete the socialist construction of our country, and to strive for the liberation of Taiwan!

Finally, I propose that our conference formally adopts the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China. Celebrate the success of our conference!

**Zhou Wenjiang's Speech**

Chairman, Comrades and Representatives:

Our country's true representative of the people's will constitution is about to be adopted at this solemn conference. We military comrades feel very excited. Our country's constitution is a constitution that unites the people of the whole country to build a happy socialist society. Today, it is not easy to successfully formulate it. The many clauses of the constitution are all the fruits of the people of the whole country and our military comrades' long-term arduous struggle, exchanged with the blood and lives of countless comrades. Therefore, we especially cherish it and must support it with actual actions.

Now the people of the whole country are enthusiastically celebrating the convening of the first session of the National People's Congress and the birth of the people's own constitution. However, we must also think that: the eight million compatriots in Taiwan, they still cannot elect their own representatives like us, attend their own conference, and exercise their own rights; they are still being trampled under the feet of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and cannot turn over. We are the people's army, and our sacred task is to defend the fruits of the people's revolution and national construction, to defend the security and territorial integrity of the state. To liberate Taiwan, our army bears the direct responsibility. We must not disappoint the expectations of the people of the whole country and must liberate Taiwan and complete the glorious task entrusted by the constitution.

We military comrades always remember what Marshal Zhu said at the Army Day this year. Marshal Zhu said very solemnly: As long as the Kuomintang bandits are not annihilated, as long as Taiwan is not liberated, the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army will not wash off the shame on their bodies and will not have anything to be proud of. The meaning of these words is to teach us: as long as we do not annihilate the Kuomintang bandits, as long as we do not liberate Taiwan, our army has not completed its own responsibility. Therefore, we are both intensifying our combat preparations and taking active actions. We must recover Taiwan and let the five-star red flag fly over every piece of land in Taiwan, let the light of the constitution shine on every compatriot in Taiwan, let our compatriots in Taiwan who have suffered so much, like us, be able to live a free and happy life!

**Dalai Lama's Speech**

Chairman Mao, Comrades and Representatives:

Today, at the first session of the First National People's Congress held in the capital of our motherland - Beijing, the Constitution of the People's Republic of China will be solemnly formulated. This is a matter that benefits the interests of all ethnic groups in the country. Regarding the minority nationalities: the draft Constitution summarizes the achievements and experiences of implementing Chairman Mao's policy of national equality and national unity over the past few years. Especially, the draft Constitution stipulates that various nationalities can formulate autonomous regulations and single regulations according to their own development characteristics to fully exercise their autonomous rights. In addition, the draft Constitution also clearly stipulates that "the state will consider the needs of various nationalities in the process of economic and cultural construction, and in the issue of socialist transformation, it will fully pay attention to the development characteristics of various nationalities." These are all correct, and we, the people of Tibet, enthusiastically express our support. Tibet has been oppressed by the reactionary governments of various dynasties in the past long history, especially due to the instigation and separation of foreign imperialists, so that the relationship with the motherland has been somewhat distant for a period of time. However, since the signing of the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet in 1951, the central representatives, the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet, and the working cadres have successively arrived in Tibet, implemented the central policy of national unity, and strictly observed and implemented the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet. These correct policies and other measures can be clearly seen. At the same time, due to the fact that several inspection teams and congratulatory teams have been sent from Tibet to the interior of the motherland over the past three years, they have explained the situation they have learned about the interior of the motherland after returning to Tibet, which has gradually dispelled the doubts of the Tibetan people. The various brotherly nationalities in China, especially the Han and Tibetan nationalities, are increasingly moving towards close unity. The return of Panchen Erdeni to Tibet and my meeting with him have further strengthened the unity within Tibet. Based on Chairman Mao's policy that there should be unity among nationalities and within nationalities, a new atmosphere of peace and friendship has already appeared in Tibet.

Regarding religion: In the various instigations of the enemy, the main one is to spread rumors that the Communist Party and the people's government will destroy religion. The Tibetan people have a deep religious belief, and these rumors have made them doubtful and uneasy, but now the rumors that the Communist Party and the people's government will destroy religion have completely failed, and the Tibetan people have personally felt that they have freedom in their religious beliefs.

Regarding the economic and cultural construction of Tibet: In the past, due to the inconvenience of transportation, it was very difficult to carry out economic and cultural construction, but with the great help of the central government, in the past three years, a lot of wasteland has been opened up, the People's Bank has been established, loans have been issued for agriculture, animal husbandry, and handicrafts, and high-priced wool that is difficult to export has been purchased, which has promoted the development of the Tibetan economy. Next, schools and hospitals have been established to cultivate Tibetan cadres and develop culture. In terms of economic construction, it is especially worth mentioning that the central government has allocated a huge amount of funds to build the Kangding-Tibet Highway. The road construction personnel have overcome all kinds of dangers on the high mountains and rapid rivers and worked hard. This highway is expected to be open to traffic to Lhasa by the end of this year. This is not only the foundation for building a prosperous new Tibet, but also has great significance for national defense.

Recently, a part of the rear Tibet has suffered from floods, and after learning about it, the central government immediately allocated 800 million yuan to relieve the disaster-stricken areas. Recently, the Agreement on Trade and Communications between the Tibet Region of China and India signed by our country and India fully reflects the wishes of the people of the Tibet region and has been supported by the people of the Tibet region. All these concrete manifestations of the central government's deep concern for Tibet and the Tibetan people, and at the same time, it also shows the strength of our motherland.

At present, in Tibet, according to the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, the local government of Tibet and the monks and laypeople are actively helping the People's Liberation Army to purchase grain and support transportation, etc. The Seventeen-Point Agreement is being implemented to enable the politics and economy of Tibet to develop better. However, due to the residual effects of the national oppression policy implemented during the long-term reactionary rule in history, the national estrangement has not been completely eliminated, and the Tibetan masses are not yet familiar with the situation of the motherland, which has caused some defects. These are being improved continuously. The measures of the People's Liberation Army and working cadres entering Tibet are all for the benefit of the Tibetan people, which we deeply understand. However, some minor issues, mainly due to language barriers and not understanding customs, have caused some small errors, which have been corrected immediately after the situation is explained. In the future, we will discuss and criticize each other without hesitation, especially under the help of the advanced Han nationality and under the leadership of our beloved great leader Chairman Mao, we have a strong confidence to abide by the constitution, implement the Seventeen-Point Agreement, and gradually build Tibet into a place of prosperity and happiness.

Finally, let me congratulate:

The health of all the representatives attending the conference!

Congratulations on the success and complete success of the conference!

**He Jianxiu's Speech**

Chairman, Comrades and Representatives:

The formulation of the constitution is the greatest joy for the people of the whole country. I am honored and happy to participate in the National People's Congress to discuss the draft Constitution. I think that every chapter, every clause, and every sentence of the draft Constitution are completely in line with the interests and wishes of the working people of the whole country, and I firmly support the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft Constitution. I suggest that the conference unanimously adopts this draft Constitution.

The first clause of the draft Constitution clearly stipulates that "the People's Republic of China is a people's democratic state led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants." The draft Constitution stipulates that our country will gradually eliminate the system of exploitation and build a socialist society through socialist industrialization and socialist transformation. "This constitution consolidates the fruits of the Chinese people's revolution and the new victories in politics and economy since the founding of the People's Republic of China, and reflects the fundamental requirements of the state in the transitional period and the common aspirations of the broad masses to build a socialist society." We, the working class, must, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, unite the people of the whole country and strive to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship in our country and realize a prosperous and happy socialist society.

The draft Constitution stipulates the basic rights and obligations of citizens and clearly points out that "labor is an honorable thing for all citizens of the People's Republic of China who have the ability to work. The state encourages citizens' initiative and creativity in labor." Women and youth also receive the state's warm care. I am a worker and also a woman and a youth. I deeply feel that the state's care and concern for us laboring people are meticulous. I sincerely thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for bringing us happiness. Looking back to the days before liberation, we workers were despised everywhere, and textile workers were called "eaters of cotton." When I was young, I picked coal, and people called me "little black ghost." In order to live, I almost ran through all the textile factories in Qingdao, and no one wanted me. Now, labor has become an honorable thing, and we workers can also go to school to study. I have personally experienced the glory and happiness of being a laborer of the People's Republic of China. Therefore, I love our motherland even more. However, our compatriots in Taiwan are still under the cruel rule of American imperialism and the Kuomintang traitor group. We must liberate the compatriots in Taiwan and complete the cause of national liberation.

Today, we Chinese people can formulate our own constitution, which is the fruit of the heroic struggle of countless revolutionary predecessors. We, the working class, must consolidate and develop this victory. We must, with actual actions, resolutely defend the constitution and become a model of abiding by the constitution. We must strictly abide by labor discipline, fully give play to the initiative and creativity of the working class, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, improve our political, cultural, and technical levels, actively participate in labor competitions, and ensure the full completion of the state plan. I am now studying in school, and I will definitely respond to Chairman Mao's call to "be healthy, study well, and work well," and study well the basic knowledge of mathematics, physics, chemistry, etc., to lay a good foundation for mastering higher scientific and technological knowledge in the future. After graduation, I will definitely, together with the people of the whole country, contribute all my strength to build our motherland into a prosperous and happy socialist country.

**Deng Yingchao's Speech**

Chairman, Comrades and Representatives:

I fully agree with the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft Constitution.

The fundamental law of our country - the Constitution of the People's Republic of China - is about to be adopted at the first session of the First National People's Congress. This constitution brings unlimited happiness to the people of the whole country and future generations and will also bring about the complete liberation of women. In the future, the task facing the people of the whole country is to strictly abide by the constitution and strive unremittingly to realize the constitution.

I would like to briefly express my opinions on the clause in Chapter III of the draft Constitution regarding the protection of marriage, family, mother, and child by the state.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China five years ago, based on the provisions of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on implementing marriage freedom and protecting mothers and children, a series of major measures have been taken: the Marriage Law and the Labor Insurance Regulations have been promulgated, and some government departments and relevant organizations have also formulated specific measures to protect marriage, mother and child, and education of infants from various aspects, and have done a lot of specific work to protect marriage, mother and child, and education of infants with the support of social forces. With the recovery and development of the national economy, the material and cultural facilities related to women and children have also been significantly improved, enabling the majority of working women to work actively and enthusiastically in production and work, and enabling children to grow up happily and live a happier life. Now, the draft Constitution clearly stipulates that "marriage, family, mother, and child are protected by the state." This will surely encourage women to continuously improve their patriotism, further give play to their enthusiasm in production and labor, which is beneficial to the promotion of the cause of socialist construction. The stipulation of this clause in the constitution marks the characteristics of a socialist-type constitution and fully demonstrates the superiority of our people's democratic system.

To implement this clause, we must first establish a socialist moral concept of equality between men and women, respect for motherhood, and love for children, and make it gradually become the universal standard in this aspect of social morality. That is to say, in protecting marriage: all marriages that comply with the Marriage Law must be protected; all those who struggle for marriage freedom to get rid of painful feudal marriages must be supported and protected; all those who misinterpret or suppress marriage freedom should be educated or punished according to the severity of the situation, and social opinion should condemn those who violate the Marriage Law, and serious cases should also be subject to legal punishment. In protecting the family: advocate and protect families that are united in production, democratic, and harmonious, and transform feudal and backward families. In protecting mothers: advocate respecting mothers and helping mothers solve difficulties and obstacles encountered in labor, and oppose discrimination against mothers. In protecting children: advocate respecting and loving children, adopting education methods suitable for children, neither treating children with adult views and requirements nor spoiling and indulging children; for the phenomenon of neglecting and not caring about children, which is still quite common, and even punishing children, it must be constantly corrected. We must be vigilant against the infiltration of feudal and bourgeois ideas into children. We must use socialist ideology to educate children and cultivate their habits of loving labor and collective life, so that children can become new people who are all-round developed in terms of physique, intelligence, morality, and beauty. At the same time, we must, on the basis of the development of national economy and culture, gradually improve various measures to protect mothers and children in an objective and realistic manner, so that they are in line with the construction of the state. Any deviation from reality and proposing overly high requirements, or having the conditions but not actively doing it, are wrong. In short, the protection of marriage, family, mother, and child is the common responsibility of the whole country, the whole society, and all citizens, and it is the glorious responsibility of parents. For this, ordinary people, even some parents, still do not have enough understanding, and our women's organizations also lack sufficient work. In the future, we must strive to overcome past shortcomings, and we hope that relevant departments will actively carry out propaganda and strengthen work in this area.

We believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the government of the People's Republic of China, all male and female citizens of the country will be full of confidence to strive for the construction of a socialist society and for the lofty purpose of world peace and human progress.

**Shen Kewei's Speech**

Chairman, Comrades and Representatives:

I, as a medical practitioner engaged in scientific research, speak to the conference.

After full national discussion and repeated revisions, the Constitution of the People's Republic of China is about to be adopted and promulgated at this solemn conference. In addition to my heartfelt support and complete agreement with this constitution, I would also like to speak from the perspective of a scientific worker and share some special and personal experiences.

First, this constitution is a socialist-type constitution. However, it starts from the reality of China and combines with the reality of China, fully embodying the scientific spirit of seeking truth from facts. It not only expresses the ideal and desire of the Chinese people to take the socialist path but also summarizes the actual experiences of the Chinese people's revolution and construction, with beautiful ideals and practical steps. Therefore, this constitution is a reasonable and practical constitution.

Second, the development of science and technology and socialist construction, these two have an inseparable mutual relationship. Without highly developed science and technology, it is impossible to complete socialist industrialization, while the development of national economic construction creates favorable conditions for the progress of science and technology. Our constitution clearly stipulates in clear language that the state guarantees citizens the freedom to conduct scientific research, literature and art, and other cultural activities, and encourages and helps the creative work of citizens engaged in science, education, literature, art, and other cultural undertakings. We, scientific workers who have struggled out of the old society, deeply feel that only in a socialist-type state, science and technology can receive such attention and support.

Since liberation, China's medical and health undertakings have made epoch-making progress and reforms. The Communist Party and the people's government, from the day they took power, have used great efforts to lead, educate, and help medical workers to reform their thinking, strengthen learning, and strive to improve the health conditions of the masses. Before liberation, our motherland was always considered a country that did not pay attention to hygiene, with epidemics rampant and a high mortality rate. However, in this short period after liberation, the situation has undergone fundamental changes. We thank the Communist Party and the people's government for their correct leadership. We are completely convinced that after a few five-year plans, our motherland will definitely become a country with the most developed medical science and the happiest people's lives.

We are sober-minded scientific workers, so we, on the one hand, affirm the great achievements of medical and health work, on the other hand, we cannot but point out that our work still has shortcomings. For example, in uniting and reforming scientific and technological workers, and in evaluating traditional Chinese medicine - the excellent national traditional medicine - and in the work of uniting Chinese and Western medicine, these are either not done perfectly or executed with deviations and shortcomings. We hope that after the promulgation of the constitution, based on the spirit of the constitution, we will improve and strengthen these aspects of work.

Comrades and representatives, I once again express my complete support and endorsement of this constitution and suggest that the conference unanimously adopts this constitution that guarantees the Chinese people to move towards freedom and happiness.

**Sang Jieyi's Speech**

Chairman, Comrades and Representatives:

I fully support the "Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China" and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report.

The preamble of the draft Constitution points out: "The various nationalities in our country have already united into a free and equal family of nationalities. On the basis of promoting friendship, mutual assistance, and opposition to imperialism among nationalities, opposing the public enemies within nationalities, and opposing great-nationalism and local nationalism, the national unity of our country will continue to strengthen." In recent years, our work practice in the two autonomous regions of Sichuan and Tibet has proven this to be completely correct.

Unity among nationalities and within nationalities is a basic condition for the progress and development of minority nationalities. To continue to progress and develop even more, we must strengthen unity in all aspects. And constantly paying attention to opposing great-nationalism and local nationalism is a major condition for continuing to strengthen national unity.

In recent years, we have done a lot of work in these aspects, and national unity has been increasingly consolidated and developed. However, experience shows that the tendencies of great-nationalism and local nationalism can reoccur at any time, so they must be constantly exposed, criticized, and overcome, only in this way can national unity continue to strengthen.

Local nationalism exists in some minority cadres. Some often consider problems from the perspective of the interests of a region or a nationality; some even only care about the interests of a few people in a region, damaging the interests of the people in other regions or other nationalities; some are not willing to actively seek the help of advanced nationalities, are not willing to learn from advanced regions; some only emphasize enjoying rights and do not want to fulfill obligations. These erroneous ideas and behaviors, although they are only a few, are harmful to national unity, and hinder the progress and development of the minority peoples, and must be gradually overcome in future work.

Great-nationalism also exists in some Han cadres, mainly manifested in: some leading departments pay little attention to or even completely ignore the work of national regions, there is no position for national work in their work schedule, they do not care about the actual situation of national work, and even decide major issues based on imagination. Some working personnel do not believe that the work in national regions will progress, they mistakenly think that everything in national regions is backward, they often deal with national issues with the perspective and superiority of a great nationality; some are not willing to patiently help minority nationalities, they either take over and replace in their work, or leave it alone; some do not pay attention to national characteristics and do not respect the customs of minority nationalities. These erroneous tendencies, although they are also the ideas and behaviors of a few departments and working personnel, are also not conducive to national unity, hinder the implementation of national policies, and must be overcome in future work.

Great-nationalism and local nationalism are not erroneous ideas that start from the overall interests of the state or the common interests of all nationalities. Regarding this issue, I myself also had shortcomings in my past understanding and work. The overcoming of this erroneous tendency must adopt a serious attitude, adhere to the policy and steps of being cautious and steady; must strengthen political and ideological leadership and ideological construction work among cadres; must establish the idea of loving the motherland among cadres, establish the correct concept of the state and the whole, and must strengthen the study of national policies, constantly pay attention to checking and improving work. I believe that under the correct and wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, any shortcomings and mistakes will definitely be overcome, national unity will definitely continue to strengthen, and our autonomous regions will definitely achieve progress and development.

**Zhang Zhizhong's Speech**

Chairman, Comrades and Representatives:

We have discussed the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China over the past few months; yesterday we also heard Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, which analyzes facts and answers questions in detail, and I fully agree with it.

This draft Constitution is the constitution of the Chinese people themselves. Its content is complete and substantial, its structure is rigorous and clear, and its wording is concise and popular. I think it has the following characteristics.

The draft Constitution stipulates the future goals of our country, pointing out that through socialist industrialization and socialist transformation, we will gradually eliminate the system of exploitation and build a socialist society. At the same time, it also specifically stipulates the steps and methods for building a socialist society.

The draft Constitution determines the nature of our country, which is a people's democratic state led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants. The power of the state belongs to the people, and the organs through which the people exercise their power are the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at various levels. The National People's Congress, local people's congresses at various levels, and other state organs all practice the system of democratic centralism.

The draft Constitution stipulates the basic rights and obligations of citizens. In Chapter III of the draft Constitution, it elaborates on fourteen items of people's freedom rights, fully satisfying the requirements and wishes of the people of the whole country. In particular, it stipulates that women enjoy equal rights with men in political, economic, cultural, social, and family life, which is very appropriate in the situation where women have suffered from feudal oppression for thousands of years. Of course, the various clauses of citizens' obligations stipulated in the draft Constitution must be observed.

The draft Constitution pays special attention to minority nationalities, in addition to clearly stipulating in the preamble and the general principles that various nationalities are equal and strengthening national unity, it also stipulates in Chapter II, Section V, a full section on "the autonomous organs of autonomous regions," and especially points out that "upper-level state organs should fully guarantee the autonomous organs of autonomous regions, autonomous prefectures, and autonomous counties to exercise their autonomous rights, and help various minority nationalities develop political, economic, and cultural construction undertakings." This fully guarantees that the various nationalities in our country can be more united, friendly, and mutually supportive to become a free and equal family of nationalities.

The draft Constitution points out that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people's democratic united front will continue to play its role in mobilizing and uniting the people of the whole country to complete the general tasks of the state in the transitional period and the struggle against domestic and foreign enemies. This is a sincere call and expectation for us various democratic classes, democratic parties, and people's organizations.

The draft Constitution's stipulations on foreign policy, in addition to continuing to develop and consolidate our country's friendship with the Soviet Union, with people's democratic countries, and with all peace-loving people in the world, it also establishes and develops diplomatic relations with any country based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity; it also points out that "in international affairs, our country's unshakable policy is to strive for the lofty purpose of world peace and human progress." This further clarifies the general direction of our country's future foreign policy and also gives a powerful refutation to the slanders of the imperialist bloc.

From the above-mentioned basic characteristics, it is already sufficient to show that this is the constitution of the Chinese people themselves, a constitution that reflects the beautiful and prosperous prospects of building a socialist society, a constitution that meets the hopes and requirements of the people of the whole country, consolidates the people's democratic system, and creates a happy life. It is warmly welcomed and supported by the people of the whole country. The people of the whole country deeply thank the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Everyone fully understands that only under the great, correct, and wise leadership of Chairman Mao can we achieve the great victory of the people's revolution against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, establish the People's Republic of China, and have such a democratic, free, and happy new constitution today.

**Bao Dashan's Speech**

Chairman, Comrades and Representatives:

Over the past three months, we have repeatedly studied this draft Constitution and also put forward our opinions. And in this revised draft Constitution, the opinions put forward by the people of Zhejiang and the representatives of Zhejiang after arriving in Beijing have been adopted. Therefore, we not only fully support this draft Constitution, hope that the conference will adopt all its clauses, but also will strive together for its implementation. This draft Constitution is completely based on the principles of people's democracy and socialism and the actual situation of China to formulate, and it is one of the most democratic and progressive constitutions in the world today. It not only determines the political system of our country but also stipulates the direction and basic steps of our social development. Five years ago, like other representatives, I also discussed the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference here and also supported its adoption. If we compare this draft Constitution with the Common Program today, it is not only a constitution and a program, but there are also important developments in nature and content.

First of all, our political system has become more democratic. According to the provisions of the draft Constitution, our system of people's congresses has been formally realized. This cannot be said to be an important development of our people's democratic system. Secondly, I think that another important development and progress is that in the draft Constitution, it is clearly stipulated that our country will take the socialist path. Five years ago, when we discussed the Common Program here, many representatives also raised the issue of the socialist future, but this sentence was not written into the Common Program, and now the greatest wish of the people of the whole country has been clearly written in, which cannot be said to be an important development. Before this, there were many people in our business community who had doubts about the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, thinking that they did not know what would happen in the future? So today, looking at this draft Constitution, I think these doubts should be dispelled.

Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft Constitution has explained various issues in detail, and I will not elaborate on them here. But I think that in the implementation and enforcement of the constitution, there is still a problem that we need to pay good attention to. That is, we Chinese people, influenced by the past reactionary dictatorship and the irrationality of the social system, lack a sense of law-abiding, for example, the phenomenon of lawlessness that occurs in some private industrial and commercial operators at present, and the phenomenon of lawlessness and disorder that occurs in some state organ personnel, are all manifestations of the lack of a sense of law-abiding.

Indeed, the proposal of the general tasks of the state in the transitional period and the results of elections at all levels of people's governments will greatly help to correct this defect, but I think in addition to this, we should also make other necessary efforts, and this aspect of effort we have not done enough in the past. The "Three Antis" and "Five Antis" movements have certainly rectified the phenomenon of corruption and bureaucratic style in state organ personnel and the illegal behavior of the bourgeoisie, but these problems should not be regarded as completely solved. If the implementation of the constitution means the beginning of the rule of law in our country, then I think it is especially important that the general public, especially private industrial and commercial operators, must cultivate the habit of law-abiding, and the personnel of state organs must also set an example in the spirit of law-abiding.

Comrades and representatives, our draft Constitution is about to be adopted as the formal Constitution, I wish that we will all, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, strive together for its implementation, the future of the People's Republic of China is bright, and our efforts will not be hindered by any force!

**Chen Jiageng's Speech**

Chairman, Comrades and Representatives:

Yesterday, I heard Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, and I fully agree with it and enthusiastically support it.

The convening of the first session of the First National People's Congress and the formulation of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China are both historic events of great significance to our country, worthy of the celebration of all compatriots at home and abroad. For a long time, overseas Chinese have been looking forward to the implementation of democratic constitutionalism in their motherland, and today, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, this has been realized.

### Title: The Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China

**Author:**

**Date:** 1954-09-20

**Page:** 1

The draft constitution is the result of Chairman Mao's decades of service to the people and was written over several months. From March of this year to mid-June, it was discussed and revised by over 8,000 people from the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, various administrative regions, provinces, and municipalities, various democratic parties, and people's organizations. It has become a magnificent and perfect constitution that suits the national conditions. However, Chairman Mao, in order to solicit a broader range of opinions from the people of the entire country regarding the draft constitution, issued it nationwide on June 15th for discussion and for people to submit their revision suggestions. This has now lasted for three months. Even overseas Chinese have had ample time to participate in the discussion and submit their opinions. However, due to environmental differences and the fact that the situation in their home country is different, they cannot organize meetings for discussion like we do domestically. Even sending letters back is difficult. Therefore, overseas Chinese cannot submit more opinions. As for electing representatives, it is also difficult. In some imperialist countries, they use international law to interfere and do not allow us to conduct elections there. To elect representatives, we would have to go to international waters by boat. With so many overseas Chinese, it is difficult and impossible to go to international waters to elect representatives. Even if we were to do so, they would interfere and might not allow us to return. Especially now that our motherland is progressing and becoming stronger day by day, imperialism is becoming more jealous and hostile towards us.

Our overseas Chinese have long known about the need for a constitution, and many are aware of it, but there may still be some who are not. However, the country must have a constitution. This is like a joint-stock company that must have a charter. The charter is drafted by the shareholders and followed by the managers and employees. If a private business lacks this, everyone acts freely, often leading to many mistakes.

In the past feudal dynasties of our country, there were no constitutions or laws, leading to corruption and decay, resulting in external aggression and internal chaos, national weakness, and poverty among the people. The late Qing Dynasty and the Kuomintang government of Chiang Kai-shek had several so-called constitutions, filled with democratic clauses and citizen rights, but they were all false and deceitful, ultimately rejected by the people of the entire country.

This draft constitution, personally drafted by Chairman Mao, draws on the constitutions of various democratic countries and takes into account the historical characteristics of our country and the actual situation of the modern era. It is a truly democratic people's constitution. Although it has undergone discussions and revisions by the people of the entire country, good suggestions have been adopted as much as possible, but the overall spirit and basic principles remain unchanged. This shows the wholehearted support of the people of the entire country and also indicates that everyone knows that only in this way can there be a bright future and that one can obtain the true rights that one should have. Even for the bourgeoisie during the period of socialist transformation, their ownership of means of production and other property rights and inheritance rights are protected by law, while on the other hand, their negative destructive actions are restricted, gradually transforming them to advance towards a socialist society.

After this constitution is promulgated and implemented, not only will the people of the entire country celebrate enthusiastically, but also the more than ten million overseas Chinese will be delighted and inspired.

Liu Min Sheng's Speech:

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully support the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft constitution. I believe that this draft constitution fully reflects the democratic life of the Chinese people and the true essence of our country's democracy. This is the result of the Chinese people's heroic struggle over more than a hundred years. One of the fundamental tasks of the Chinese revolution is to achieve people's democracy. The Chinese Communist Party represents the will of the Chinese people's revolution, formulates the program for the people's democratic revolution, and, according to the principles of the people's congress system and the specific conditions and actual situations of each revolutionary stage, establishes revolutionary state organs and people's democratic institutions, thereby uniting the people of the entire country to defeat the enemy. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Common Program has been promulgated, and people's democratic dictatorship has been implemented, achieving a series of new victories in social reform and economic recovery. Based on the Common Program and under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao, this draft constitution has been formulated. There is no doubt that this draft constitution is a major guarantee for gradually realizing the socialist industrialization of the state and gradually completing the socialist transformation in the future.

However, in the past, we did not study and research the policies and decrees of the central government enough, and our understanding was insufficient. This led to the inability to correctly and comprehensively implement them. Therefore, the various levels of people's governments in Shandong Province have made many mistakes and shortcomings in their work. First, the implementation of the people's democratic system was not forceful enough, resulting in the failure of the people's congresses at the provincial and some county levels to be convened on time. Second, the opinions of the people were not fully listened to, and the people's hardships were not solved in a timely manner. As for the style of work, there were also serious problems of commandism, simplicity, and dispersion. This greatly affected the relationship between the government and the people, damaging the people's initiative. Now that the constitution is about to be promulgated and implemented, in the future, we will definitely faithfully abide by the constitution, rely on the people, accept the people's supervision, be loyal to the people's democratic system, and strive to serve the people. I believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government, we will definitely overcome the past mistakes and shortcomings, further unite the people of the entire province, and strive to complete the glorious tasks assigned by the state.

Yang Shi Xian's Speech:

Chairman, fellow representatives:

With boundless joy and heartfelt gratitude, I, on behalf of the people of Tianjin and the Tianjin delegation, fully agree with and enthusiastically support the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China, as revised and adopted by the 34th meeting of the Central People's Government Council, and agree with Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China. This draft constitution is the result of the blood and sacrifice of countless revolutionary martyrs. It legally consolidates the fruits of our revolution. It represents the will of the 600 million people of China to consolidate their people's democratic regime and to transition to a socialist society through peaceful means. It is a socialist-type constitution that also suits the transitional period. The birth of this constitution will undoubtedly greatly inspire the people of the entire country, pushing everyone to unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party, consciously contribute their strength, and strive to complete the general tasks of the transitional period.

During this in-depth study and active discussion, I deeply felt that in many aspects, I did not fully understand the spirit of the state's policies and decrees, resulting in some losses in my work. For example, Article 95 of the draft constitution clearly stipulates that "the state encourages and assists the creative work of citizens engaged in scientific, educational, literary, artistic, and other cultural undertakings." Universities are the highest institutions of learning in the state and an important symbol of the people's scientific and cultural level. They must actively carry out planned and guided research work to make significant creative contributions in academia. Research work should be actively carried out without affecting teaching reform and teaching work, and it should not be neglected and allowed to become chaotic, as happened in Nankai University last year. This is a deep self-criticism I should make.

In the comprehensive study of Soviet higher education, we have realized that teaching and research are two aspects of the same thing and must be unified, not opposed to each other. If a teacher only engages in teaching without conducting research, they will eventually become dogmatic. Conducting research, discovering new knowledge and new laws of things, also enriches teaching. This not only solves the problem of teaching combined with practice but also solves the problem of improving teaching quality. Because the research topics are either urgent issues in academia that need to be clarified or issues that need to be answered in production and construction. Currently, various schools are developing too fast, and the number of qualified teachers is too small, so we should frankly admit that the teaching quality of various colleges and universities today is quite low and does not meet the standards required by the state to build socialist talents. The key to improvement is, on the one hand, to give full play to the potential of teachers with ability and training, and on the other hand, to vigorously cultivate outstanding young teaching assistants and carry out research work in a planned and guided manner. In terms of giving full play to potential, we have achieved some results by strengthening the unity between old and new teachers. The vigorous cultivation of young teaching assistants is also being implemented. However, the difficulty we encounter here is the poor quality of the graduates allocated. Some have poor professional skills, and some even fail in several major courses; some have low consciousness, and some even have bad character. Teachers are role models for students. Only those who can be role models for students in terms of scholarship, moral character, and political consciousness can lead students. Therefore, not every university graduate can be a university teacher. The leadership must correct the wrong view of teacher resources, which considers them secondary compared to the needs of the economic construction sector, and must also correct the egalitarian style of thinking that one good person can be paired with two bad ones. If we do not have the resolve to allocate graduates who can be cultivated as teachers to universities, we will not be able to complete our tasks in the future and cultivate talents that meet the standards. The Soviet Union, in its process of building the country, also resolutely retained the best graduates as teachers from the beginning. In terms of carrying out research work, if we only understand its importance and begin to do it, it is not enough. We must carry out research work in a planned and guided manner. It is not feasible to do everything at once due to insufficient conditions. It is also wrong to do it casually, not with full effort, and not to propose different research requirements for teachers with different abilities. I now realize the root cause of my mistakes is conservatism and self-satisfaction. I thought that Nankai University had done research in the past and still has people doing research now. Since the facts do not allow for a full-scale deployment, it is better to wait until after the curriculum reform is completed next year to carry out research work on a grand scale. This wrong idea, if not pointed out in time by Soviet experts, would have affected Nankai University's work to improve teaching quality. This is something I should be alert to in the future and can be used as a reference for other universities.

Ye Yi Dong's Speech:

Chairman, fellow representatives, and guests:

As a representative of the Indonesian Chinese, I enthusiastically support Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the constitution. The preamble of our constitution states: "Our country, based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, has established and developed diplomatic relations with any country, and this policy has achieved success and will continue to be implemented in the future. In international affairs, our country's unwavering policy is to strive for the lofty goals of world peace and human progress." This about the efforts of our country in international relations and policies has a particularly significant meaning for overseas Chinese who have been living abroad for a long time. We overseas Chinese, following this spirit, live in harmony with the local people. We, as overseas Chinese, do not participate in local political disputes and do not interfere in local politics, and at the same time, we hope that the government of our host country can establish friendly relations with our motherland.

The Chinese people and the Indonesian people are both peace-loving, and there has been a long-standing friendship between the two countries. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, this friendly relationship has developed further. We overseas Chinese in Indonesia have always lived in harmony with the local people and are willing to promote this friendly relationship and strengthen the friendly diplomatic ties between Indonesia and our motherland. This year, in June, Premier Zhou, during his visit to India and Burma, issued a joint statement with the Prime Ministers of India and Burma, proposing the five principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. These five principles have been widely welcomed by many countries in Asia and the world. These five principles more concretely embody the peaceful spirit of our country's foreign policy and demonstrate the sincere desire of our people for peace. We overseas Chinese in Indonesia also enthusiastically support these five peaceful foreign policy principles and look forward to the further development and consolidation of diplomatic ties between the Republic of Indonesia and our country.

However, the warmongering elements of American imperialism have incited the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek who have fled to Indonesia to do their utmost to sabotage the diplomatic ties between our motherland and Indonesia, sabotage the peaceful trade between our motherland and Indonesia, and stir up the friendly relationship between overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people. For the common interests of the people of our motherland and Indonesia, we must resolutely oppose this plot of provocation.

Liberating Taiwan and eliminating the traitorous clique of Chiang Kai-shek is a sacred historical mission of our people. Overseas Chinese firmly support and support the struggle of our motherland to liberate Taiwan. Only by liberating Taiwan can the security of our motherland be further consolidated and the peace of Asia and the world be guaranteed. The Indonesian people and the people of the world who love peace sympathize with the just struggle of our people to liberate Taiwan, just as we Chinese people sympathize with the struggle of the Indonesian people to reclaim West Irian.

Representatives, the brilliant achievements of our motherland's economic construction and the great victories of our country's peaceful foreign policy in international struggles have already greatly enhanced our motherland's international prestige. This is especially exciting for us who are abroad. In the future, we overseas Chinese will be more united, regardless of faction or class, and help each other to do a good job in our own welfare undertakings. For those who have been misled and used by the traitors of Chiang, we welcome them to see the light. We must strive to make our compatriots all closely unite around Chairman Mao and our motherland and strive to promote friendship and unity between overseas Chinese and the people of the host country.

Rong Yi Ren's Speech:

Chairman, fellow representatives:

Since the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China was promulgated, private industrialists and merchants in Shanghai have conducted extensive study and discussion, unanimously expressing their joy and enthusiasm, and actively accepting transformation to enthusiastically support and welcome the birth of the constitution of the People's Republic of China.

The constitution is about to be adopted, and all the people of the country must jointly abide by it to ensure the realization of our common wishes. We private industrialists and merchants, of course, should also strictly abide by it. However, due to the capitalist nature of private industrialists and merchants, which is driven by profit, although there have been some progress after liberation, they still have some negative effects on the national economy and the people's livelihood. As for Shanghai, so far, most private industrial and commercial enterprises have entered various forms of state-capitalist economy. More than 1,100 large and medium-sized factories have applied for joint state-private ownership, and the number is still increasing. However, there are still many industrialists and merchants who have some concerns, hesitation, passivity, and impatience in their minds. In specific actions, the industrial sector still cannot fully complete the state's tasks on time, in quantity, and in quality. For example, my own enterprise also has delays in delivery, substandard products exceeding the standard, and a lot of waste. There are even a few factories with serious phenomena of shoddy work. In the commercial sector, the situation of not following market management and various dishonest business practices has not yet changed as it should. In terms of taxation, the phenomenon of tax evasion is still quite widespread; some enterprises have the passive behavior of withdrawing funds or waiting for consumption. There are even a few enterprise owners who have committed serious acts of assaulting cadres and sabotaging production to resist transformation. Therefore, how private industrialists and merchants can take more concrete actions to abide by the constitution and accept transformation is a serious practical problem.

We private industrialists and merchants must sincerely accept the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the working class, consciously accept transformation, constantly engage in self-criticism, and resolutely fight against the "selfish and greedy" mentality, making personal interests subordinate to collective interests. In specific actions, the most basic thing is to love the country and abide by the law, accept the management of state administrative organs, the leadership of state-owned economy, and the supervision of the working masses, and strive to enter the higher forms of state-capitalist economy. We must study continuously and gradually cultivate socialist ideas and labor attitudes. Among industrialists and merchants, we should help and supervise each other, criticize each other, and seek common progress. At the same time, due to our existence of capitalist ideas and styles, especially Shanghai industrialists and merchants, who have been deeply poisoned by imperialist decadent ideas, we sincerely request people from all walks of life to give us serious, frank, and brotherly criticism, education, and help, to help us transform and progress.

The Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Chambers of Commerce are people's organizations composed of various types of industrialists and merchants and should appropriately use this organizational force to promote the transformation of private enterprises and industrialists and merchants. We hope that the industrial and commercial administrative departments can strengthen leadership and help them improve their organizations. At the same time, representatives of state-owned enterprises, especially those participating in the Chambers of Commerce, must actively participate in their various work and provide specific leadership. This will be more beneficial to the construction of the country and the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. Therefore, we oppose the wrong view of some state-owned representatives who regard the Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Chambers of Commerce as purely bourgeois organizations and refuse to lead them.

Fellow representatives, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we have such a constitution that is unanimously supported by the people of the entire country as our code of conduct. The unity of the people of our country will definitely be even tighter, and our lofty common wishes will definitely be realized smoothly.

Zhang Da Hui's Speech:

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I, as a people's representative and a scientist, enthusiastically support the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China and enthusiastically support Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft constitution.

From Article 95 of the draft constitution, it can be clearly seen that our country attaches great importance to and cares for science, culture, and citizens engaged in scientific and cultural undertakings. In the future, I will be more active in scientific research work and support the constitution with practical actions. Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, I have shifted from pure scientific research to technical scientific research in coal and petroleum. At that time, I hoped to obtain the support of the reactionary government and contribute my strength in science and technology to help the people of our country drive back the aggression of Japanese imperialism. At that time, I proposed and attempted to research the production of important national defense materials from plant oil, and also began to research the method of refining coal into gasoline. However, I fled from Beijing to Changsha, from Changsha to Kunming, from a university to a research institution, and encountered countless difficulties in equipment, manpower, and funding. Although I built a small coal refining plant with great effort, it was eventually stopped. Science, in the eyes of the reactionary ruling class, is just an ornament. The scientific research we conducted, which was closely related to the Anti-Japanese War, did not receive any support from the traitorous clique of Chiang Kai-shek under the reactionary rule and was thus suppressed and strangled.

In 1949, I went to Dalian to engage in scientific research work. At that time, there were many difficulties, but because the Chinese Communist Party and the people's government attached great importance to science, continuously supplied equipment, manpower, and funding, and supported and encouraged us from all aspects, under the efforts of all staff, our work made smooth progress and has already achieved new scientific achievements. This new scientific achievement, under the attention and support of the government, will soon be applied in the socialist industrialization process of our motherland.

Fellow representatives: This is my brief experience in scientific work, a stark contrast between before and after liberation.

In the past five years, our achievements are still very small. Some major scientific and technological research work has just begun, and some have not even started. We will, with a humble and diligent attitude, strengthen our learning, work hard, and respond to the concern and encouragement of our motherland and people.

In this great historical period of our transition to a socialist society, the state's requirements for us are increasing. China's science is originally weak, with a low level, and the scientific team is still small. However, the relevant departments of the state have not paid enough attention to the unified planning and close cooperation of scientific and technological research work, resulting in the dispersion of scientific forces. Therefore, some work is repeated, and some very important work has not yet begun. We scientific workers still have the tendency to detach from reality and be impractical, often emphasizing that the working conditions are not good or that the research topics do not match personal interests, and are reluctant to accept. Especially in our scientific research departments, the leadership of political thought and the organization of scientific research work are not done well, causing many losses to the work. However, these difficulties and shortcomings in the process of progress and the shortcomings in the work will definitely be overcome. We will, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, be more closely united, closely follow the actual situation, sincerely learn from the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union, actively cultivate new forces, and better serve the construction of the country, follow the path prescribed by the constitution, and strive for the brilliant socialist society!

Chen Yin Nan's Speech:

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully support the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft constitution.

Our constitution has built a solid fortress for the great achievements that the Chinese people have already achieved and has laid a smooth track for the construction of a socialist state. This fortress and track are the crystallization of the long-term arduous struggle of the Chinese people and the concentrated expression of the high wisdom of the people of the entire country. The people of the entire country will henceforth unleash boundless energy.

If young people support this constitution because the Chinese Communist Party has opened up a limitless bright future for them, then we old people support this constitution not only because we enjoy today's happy life but also because we have experienced the hardships and pains of yesterday. I think that when the people of the entire country are eagerly awaiting the adoption of this constitution, it is beneficial to recall the past few decades of history. Take my own experience, for example, I hated the despotism and treachery of the Qing Dynasty and participated in the revolutionary struggle of the Xinhai Revolution. Later, the Qing Dynasty was overthrown, but our right to vote was still deprived. Everyone must still remember that in the early days of the Republic, the conditions for voting were: one must have property worth more than 50,000 yuan, the title of a scholar or above, and pay direct taxes of more than two dollars a year. Through these conditions, the right to vote fell into the hands of a few rich people. This is still called democracy? Therefore, after overthrowing the despotic Qing Dynasty, what we got was still an undemocratic "Republic" government. This is unacceptable to anyone with a basic democratic consciousness. Later, the enemy of the people, Chiang Kai-shek, took the stage, not only did it not improve, but even this little "democracy" was wiped out. Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship, treachery, oppression of the people, and persecution of democratic personages completely turned himself into a butcher. His dark rule exceeded that of any previous government and even surpassed the feudal dynasties. However, he could not intimidate the people, and the people never lost their confidence. The Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, after a long period of arduous struggle and heroic sacrifice, finally won a great victory that shook the world. There is no doubt that this constitution is the result of the martyrs' blood and the fruit of the people's struggle. I think, regardless of old people, adults, or young people, the more they know how hard this constitution was to obtain, the more they will cherish it, abide by it, and use their whole lives to defend it.

Now, in our country, if we talk about the national system and the overall leadership, we can proudly say that we are completely democratic. But this does not mean that every organization, every working cadre, and every department possesses this democratic spirit. We still have some grassroots cadres with the style of commandism. They have a good sense of responsibility for completing tasks, but they forget the unity of being responsible to the superiors and the masses. Of course, the emergence of this situation should not be blamed too much on the grassroots cadres, because the commandism from above often comes from the bureaucracy of some central departments. For example, in the previous period of "separating humans and livestock" and "creating mosquito-free areas," their starting point was good, but in the current rural conditions, this hope is unrealistic and subjective. Such tasks are given to grassroots cadres to carry out, how can there not be commandism? Again, in some areas, in organizing mutual aid and cooperation, sometimes it is said to be too hasty, sometimes it is said to be too lax, and there is no consensus. Therefore, not only do the masses have opinions, but even the lower-level cadres also have opinions. It can be seen that the shortcomings in the style of thought and work of grassroots cadres are often not just their own shortcomings. If the leading cadres can start from reality, understand the situation below, and lead in a timely manner, give specific instructions, and set a good example for the subordinates, many shortcomings can be avoided or reduced.

I think the promulgation of the constitution will further raise the awareness of patriotism and socialism among the people of the entire country, especially the staff of state organs, and can correct some of the bureaucracy and commandism that exists, and will strongly promote production and construction and various work, and will consciously fulfill the duties of citizens, abide by the constitution and laws. The adoption of this constitution once again shows that no force in the world can stop the great Chinese people from advancing towards a socialist society.

Han Wang Chen's Speech:

Chairman, fellow representatives:

We, the business community, enthusiastically support the draft constitution, which has been thoroughly discussed and repeatedly revised by the people of the entire country, and agree with Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft constitution. We believe that the draft constitution's stipulation that "the state, according to the law, protects the ownership of production materials and other property ownership of capitalists. The state adopts the policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce. The state, through the management of state administrative organs, the leadership of state-owned economy, and the supervision of the working masses, utilizes the positive role of capitalist industry and commerce that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, restricts its negative role that is not beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, encourages and guides it to transform into various forms of state-capitalist economy, and gradually replaces capitalist ownership with full public ownership. The state prohibits all illegal acts of capitalists that harm public interests, disrupt social economic order, and sabotage state economic plans" is completely correct. This points out the direction and bright future for all of us private industrialists and merchants.

We private industrialists and merchants in Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City, through the discussion of the draft constitution, not only deeply understood the democracy of our country's constitution but also gradually recognized the superiority of the state-capitalist economy and the necessity of accepting socialist transformation from the facts since liberation. Many people have increased production, improved management, paid taxes early, and taken practical actions to support the draft constitution to show their support. There are also some people who, in the discussion, reviewed their past lack of understanding of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and made self-criticisms for their past passive management, withdrawal of funds, and tax evasion. In the future, we private industrialists and merchants in Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City will continue to correct our understanding, improve our management, abide by the constitution, and strive to bring our enterprises into the track of state-capitalist economy, actively create conditions, accept socialist transformation, and complete the tasks of national construction. We will closely unite around the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government and, with the people of the entire country, strive to implement the constitution and complete the general task of building socialism.

Chen Ming Ren's Speech:

Chairman, fellow representatives:

The primary task of the First Session of the First National People's Congress is to formulate our country's constitution. This is a matter of great historical significance. I participated in the discussion of the "Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China" and listened to the report by Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee, on the "Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China" at this session. I fully agree with and enthusiastically support the above draft constitution and report and propose that the congress adopt and formally promulgate it as the first constitution of the People's Republic of China.

Our constitution, in the form of legislation, consolidates the fruits of the people's revolution and the new victories in politics and economics since the founding of the People's Republic of China. At the same time, it, in the form of legislation, affirms the general tasks of the state in the transitional period, points out the direction of socialism, and gives the people of the entire country a goal to strive for. Therefore, consolidating and developing these achievements and victories is the sacred task given to us by the constitution. This task is the task of the people of the entire country, and it is even more the glorious task of the People's Liberation Army.

To implement the constitution and safeguard the constitution, the army must first strengthen the education of the rule of law and overcome the arrogance of past merits, so that the army personnel can become models of abiding by the constitution. In the past five years, the People's Liberation Army has made great contributions to safeguarding national security and assisting the state in economic construction, and the relationship between the army and the people and the army and the government is basically harmonious. However, there are still some shortcomings. Some of us think that we are "superior" and can disregard the state's laws, and even arbitrarily violate laws and disciplines, such as arbitrarily occupying civilian houses, military vehicles not following traffic rules, and frequently causing traffic accidents, and having an unkind attitude when dealing with the government. These thoughts and behaviors, if not corrected, will affect the unity between the army and the people and the army and the government and will affect the implementation of the constitution.

In the "Organic Law of Local People's Congresses and Local People's Governments of the People's Republic of China," it is stipulated that the welfare work tasks of local state administrative organs at all levels. It should be said that the welfare work in the past few years has achieved great results, but in protecting the marriage of revolutionary soldiers, helping revolutionary families to overcome difficulties in production and life, and properly arranging demobilized and transferred soldiers, there are still some problems that should be solved, can be solved, but have not been solved. The personnel of the surrendered troops have mostly honorably and happily embarked on new posts of work, study, and production; but there are still a few who have not been properly arranged. I hope that the above problems will be highly valued by local state administrative organs at all levels in the future.

Recently, various democratic parties and people's organizations in our country have issued a joint declaration for the liberation of Taiwan. I think this declaration is completely consistent with the stipulation of Article 20 of the draft constitution. This is a solemn revolutionary proclamation to condemn the traitorous clique of Chiang Kai-shek. We, the People's Liberation Army, support this declaration and believe that the liberation of Taiwan is a sacred struggle that our people cannot avoid. This struggle requires the cooperation of all aspects, but the main and final task is still a military task. Therefore, our army must strengthen political and military training, accelerate the regularization and modernization of the army, and always be ready for battle. Once the order is given, our army will be ready to fight and liberate Taiwan, and plant the five-star red flag all over Taiwan.

The joint declaration points out that, except for Chiang Kai-shek himself, anyone who follows Chiang Kai-shek to Taiwan is allowed to see the light and receive the generous treatment of not being held accountable for past crimes. Now, those who have fled to Taiwan see that the traitorous clique of Chiang Kai-shek will definitely be eliminated and Taiwan will definitely be liberated, so they are willing to repent to the people, but there are still some who are hesitant. Therefore, I would like to point out to these people that the Chinese Communist Party always keeps its word, and the generous policy is genuine and will be implemented. My past sins are not lighter than those of some people in Taiwan now. Because I was able to turn back from the brink of a precipice and repent to the people, the Chinese Communist Party gave me generous treatment. Not only that, in the past few years, the Chinese Communist Party has also educated me, encouraged me, helped me, and given me the opportunity to serve the people, making me a senior cadre of the People's Liberation Army. Now I am also elected as a representative of the First National People's Congress. I was once blind and foolish, fighting for Chiang Kai-shek, and became a henchman of the traitor. But today, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, I can use all my strength to serve the people and share the joy and happiness in collective affairs. The generous policy of the Chinese Communist Party saved me, allowing me to pull my legs out of the mud and start anew. This is an iron fact. Those in Taiwan should see this and similar facts, wake up and repent, and return to the motherland as soon as possible.

Taiwan must be liberated, and Taiwan will definitely be liberated. Justice is on our side, and victory will definitely be on our side.

Wei Wen Fu's Speech:

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with the draft constitution and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft constitution. Now I would like to talk about my understanding of the draft constitution.

As is known, our draft constitution was carefully researched and drafted by the Constitution Drafting Committee over a long period and was discussed and revised many times by the broad masses of the people across the country, from top to bottom and from bottom to top, absorbing opinions from all aspects. The spirit and principles of the draft constitution were carefully considered and revised many times by many people. The process of drafting this constitution is so serious, realistic, and democratic, which is rarely seen in the history of constitution-making in the world. Just this alone is enough for us to be proud of.

Indeed, this draft constitution is a record of the victory of the Chinese people's revolution and a summary of experience, and it is also a beacon illuminating our path forward. It is like a milestone in historical development, marking how far we have come and indicating where we should go. It is like a mirror of modern China, reflecting the profound changes in Chinese society and the new face of Chinese society. Look, the feudal land ownership system that has been pressing on our heads for many years, bureaucratic capital, and imperialist forces have all been swept away by the great power of the people's revolution. Look, a people's democratic regime led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants has been solemnly established, and a bright path to a socialist society has been clearly opened. Many progressive ideals of mankind and the long-cherished wishes of everyone have been presented here. Looking back a few decades, we could not even get a poorly written imperial constitution, but now we have a true constitution of the people. At that time, what we heard in our ears was "division," "division," but now our country stands at the forefront of defending world peace, appearing on the international stage as one of the great powers, which cannot be erased by any conspiracy or violence. Speaking of this, we cannot help but deeply thank the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and thank the countless martyrs who have struggled and sacrificed their blood for the revolutionary cause of the motherland. Without them, we would not have come to this day, and we would not have this constitution.

Of course, our constitution is still a transitional constitution. We have not yet built a socialist society, but we are only in the process of transition. Every provision of our constitution is based on the historical characteristics of our transitional period and our own specific conditions, and it is produced from the actual needs of our broad masses. Of course, we do not stop at the status quo, our goal of struggle and our path of development are clearly indicated in our constitution.

The important thing is to practice. The direction is clear, and the task is determined. What duties each citizen should fulfill, what rights each citizen should enjoy, what each cadre and each organ should do are all clearly stated in the constitution. From now on, we must act according to the constitution. Our thoughts and qualities must meet the standards required by the constitution. I enthusiastically and sincerely support this constitution and am willing to stand at my post to strive for the implementation of this constitution. We have obtained this constitution with great difficulty! We have struggled for decades for this constitution and finally achieved victory. We will continue to struggle hard in the future, through a series of acute and complex struggles to implement this constitution, and take it as a basis to move forward and strive for greater victories! I wish all representatives good health!

Ou Bai Chuan's Speech:

Chairman, fellow representatives:

After the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China was promulgated, we have studied and discussed it many times, especially at this conference, after listening to Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China, we feel extremely excited and express our heartfelt support.

We, the Miao, Buyi, Dong, Yi, and Water families of Guizhou, have suffered oppression and exploitation from generation to generation under the bloodthirsty rule of the feudal dynasties and the Kuomintang bandits, to the point of being massacred. In the Qing Dynasty's Xianfeng and Tongzhi years, the Miao people on the Miaoling Mountains were killed to the point where their bones were scattered everywhere, and the clear water of the Qingjiang River was dyed red with blood.

In 1943, the Kuomintang bandits massacred thousands of Miao people in the Qingjiang River basin, stabbing pregnant women with bayonets, and burning down more than 2,000 houses. In 1947, the Kuomintang bandits carried out even more brutal assimilation policies, not allowing various ethnic minorities to speak their own languages, forcibly cutting women's hair, and burning their skirts. In those days of hardship, the ethnic minorities lived in poverty and misery, covering themselves with "seed quilts," eating "wild vegetables," and even 17- or 18-year-old girls had no pants to wear. In the winter of 1949, the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao liberated us. Due to the correct implementation of the ethnic policy, the strengthening of ethnic unity, and the establishment of six autonomous counties, the cultivation of a large number of ethnic cadres, and the help of ethnic minorities in developing agriculture, education, health, and other undertakings, and the respect for ethnic customs and habits, the ethnic relationship and material and cultural life have undergone fundamental changes. This has turned the history of ethnic oppression and slavery into an era of ethnic equality, making various ethnic groups a close-knit family. We feel that only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can ethnic minorities obtain equality and freedom.

In the past four years, our ethnic work has achieved great results. In the process of a series of work, we have created some favorable conditions, but we have not done enough in investigation and research. The Miao ethnic area along the Qingjiang River and the Buyi ethnic area along the Nanpanjiang River have the conditions to establish an autonomous region equivalent to a special district, but it has not been established yet; the agricultural tax in the border counties of Congjiang and Liping has not been reasonably adjusted; the financial division of autonomous counties has not been implemented; the problem of ethnic marriage disputes has not been well solved, making the masses dissatisfied.

The draft constitution fully reflects the fundamental requirements and common aspirations of the people of all ethnic groups in the transitional period of the state and stipulates that the People's Republic of China is a unified multi-ethnic state, all ethnic groups are equal, and all ethnic groups have the freedom to use and develop their own languages and scripts. Ethnic autonomous areas where ethnic minorities live in compact communities implement regional autonomy. This guarantees that ethnic minorities will, with the development of the state's construction, gradually rise from backward ethnic groups to advanced ethnic groups in politics, economy, and culture. Therefore, we, the ethnic minorities of Guizhou, when discussing the draft constitution, had an old Miao man, Yang Guo'an, who was 120 years old. After hearing the transmission of the draft constitution, he was so moved that he shed tears of joy and said: "Chairman Mao is the father of the Miao people. He cares about everything for us. The spirit of the constitution has deeply moved all the ethnic minorities of our province.

In the future, our ethnic work will, according to the provisions of the constitution, continue to implement and promote regional autonomy, vigorously develop agricultural production, eliminate the backward production methods of "chasing mountains to eat" and "broad sowing and thin harvesting," and achieve a prosperous life. We will cultivate ethnic cadres, strengthen ethnic unity, and closely unite around the Communist Party and Chairman Mao to strive for the construction of a great motherland of all ethnic peoples.

Finally, I request the conference to adopt our draft constitution.

Deng Zao Xiang's Speech:

Chairman, fellow representatives, and comrades:

Since the Central People's Government promulgated the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China, people of all ethnic groups, all classes, men and women, old and young across the country have conducted enthusiastic discussions, fully displaying the spirit of being the masters of the house, actively proposing opinions, and then by the representatives of the First National People's Congress, gathering in the capital, for further discussion, and finally drafting it. This constitution, drafted by the people themselves, has affirmed the fruits of our revolutionary struggle and determined the socialist path we should take to obtain a more prosperous life. It embodies the overall interests and unshakable will of the 600 million people of our country. The people of the entire country are proud to live in the era of Mao Zedong.

I, like everyone else, am excited and enthusiastic about the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft constitution. I fully agree with and enthusiastically support it and propose that the conference unanimously adopt it.

Comrades: We must not forget that this victory is the result of the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, struggling hard to obtain. It is the result of countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificing their blood. Our lofty aspirations we pursue are to build a prosperous and happy socialist society and the progress of mankind. This must not be allowed to be invaded or obstructed by anyone. But American imperialism is still supporting the traitorous clique of Chiang Kai-shek, occupying Taiwan, and attempting to restore power, and is organizing military encirclement and aggression. We, to protect our future happiness that will continue to improve, the people of the entire country should be more closely united around the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao and, with practical actions, implement the constitution we have formulated, defend the motherland, liberate Taiwan, and struggle for the complete victory of the people's liberation cause.

We, the Navy of the People's Liberation Army of China, under the organization and leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, have already formed a flesh-and-blood relationship with the people of the entire country. Under the concern and support of the people of the entire country, we will definitely, according to Chairman Mao's instructions, build a strong navy, defend the coast, and oppose imperialist aggression. Recently, the joint declaration for the liberation of Taiwan by various democratic parties and people's organizations in our country represents the will of the people of the entire country and declares that the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan. This immediately received the response and full support of the people of the entire country. I deeply feel honored to be a member of the Navy of the People's Liberation Army and am determined to work with everyone to carry forward the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army, in addition to continuing to study Marxism-Leninism and the works of Mao Zedong, constantly improving our consciousness, we must also actively strengthen military training, always be alert, and be ready to accept orders at any time to contribute all our strength to the liberation of Taiwan, our motherland.

The joint declaration for the liberation of Taiwan has pointed out a way out for those who depend on the traitors. They should see the future, abandon darkness for light, and in the struggle to liberate Taiwan, redeem their sins and return to the embrace of the motherland, and under the shining light of the constitution, become good citizens.

Comrades! This constitution is formulated for the interests of all the people of China. It summarizes the victories of our revolutionary struggle and points out the direction for us to enter a prosperous and happy socialist society. We must unite and strive to complete the great task of implementing the constitution. Kai Quan's Speech:

Chairman, fellow representatives:

When we are about to solemnly adopt the constitution, we sincerely thank the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong for their correct leadership. We must resolutely abide by the constitution and act according to the constitution, and with the greatest effort, support the implementation of the constitution.

I am a water conservancy and power generation engineer. I have experienced the reactionary rule of the puppet Manchukuo and the Kuomintang, and deeply feel that the water conservancy industry could not develop and was not for the people's benefit in those dark times. Just take the construction of the Fengman Water Power Station in the Northeast as an example. The Japanese invaders, in order to plunder our country's resources, forcibly occupied and bought farmers' land at low prices, conscripted our compatriots, and worked for them under extremely poor construction conditions. Under such forced labor, the concrete dam they built was of poor quality.

When the Kuomintang "received" the power, they not only did not repair the dam but also, following the advice of the American imperialist engineer Carden, blew up a section of the dam, causing the power station to be damaged.

I spent more than ten years in this water conservancy and power generation project, but the entire project was dragged on, and it was not completed until just before liberation.

After liberation, due to the correct leadership of the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government, and the selfless help of Soviet experts, as well as the efforts of all the staff, the power station was quickly restored and underwent scientific reconstruction and expansion, making it effectively serve the national economy. These fully demonstrate the superiority of our people's democratic system and, at the same time, the advanced nature of Soviet technology has also been proven here again. Therefore, we must love our national system and, in the construction of a socialist society, seriously learn from the Soviet Union.

In capitalist countries, due to the obstacles of private ownership, many construction projects, if they conflict with the interests of capitalists, cannot be carried out, especially like water conservancy and power generation projects, which require comprehensive development of rivers, involving flood control, water and soil conservation, power generation, irrigation, navigation, rafting, fisheries, and the use of river and land rights. In capitalist countries, under the conditions of each acting on its own and seeking profit, rivers cannot be reasonably utilized. These problems have been completely solved in our constitution.

According to the experience of Soviet construction, to build a socialist society, it is necessary to comprehensively develop water resources on a large scale to gradually achieve the electrification of the entire country, and only in a socialist-type country can such large-scale water power stations like the Soviet Union's Kuibyshev and Stalingrad be built. Our country's water resources are abundant, and we have the experience of Soviet construction to learn from, so we have the conditions to do a good job in water conservancy and power generation. However, in the past, we lacked a long-term perspective on river development, and a unified plan was not made in time, and relevant departments lacked initiative and close cooperation with each other. For example, the Guanting Reservoir, in the problem of flood control and power generation, due to different views, had caused losses. We must learn from the Soviet Union in river development, formulate a long-term power development plan as the basis for national economic development; establish a unified organization for national topographic surveys, geological surveys, hydrological observations, and various aspects; compile a national water resource development outline and a ten-to-twenty-year water power generation construction plan, so that the water conservancy construction of the country's rivers can be implemented step by step, in an orderly manner, and with a focus under the guidance of a unified national plan. At present, our country is planning the comprehensive development plan of the entire Yellow River and the design and construction of the Guanting and other water power stations in many places. We will be able to and definitely will develop the water power industry on a large scale in the future, making the rivers of the entire country effectively serve the national economy. As a water conservancy and power generation worker, I am grateful to the state for the encouragement and help given to scientific research and creative work. Let us accelerate the progress of the water conservancy industry across the country and contribute all our strength to the construction of the socialist industrialization of the country.

Chen Yi's Speech:

Chairman and fellow representatives:

After listening to Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China, I feel very excited and satisfied, and at the same time, I feel very honored to have the opportunity to participate in the discussion and formulation of this constitution.

This constitution is the first constitution of the People's Republic of China and is also the first truly people-oriented constitution in our country's history. The drafting, discussion, revision, and adoption of this constitution have taken a very democratic and very solemn attitude, adopted the method of combining leadership with the masses, extensively solicited the opinions of the people, concentrated the wishes of the masses, and further organized and refined various opinions. Such constitution-making is a fundamental revolution in our country's constitutional history. Take Shanghai as an example, since July this year, 270 out of the 6,270,000 people in the city have listened to reports on the draft constitution, and 156 out of them have enthusiastically participated in the discussion of the draft constitution. According to the current statistics, Shanghai people have proposed more than 165,000 suggestions for modification and supplementation in the discussion of the draft constitution. Such in-depth propaganda and mass discussion, on the one hand, greatly raised the socialist consciousness of the masses, and on the other hand, also raised the enthusiasm of various actual work. The people of Shanghai are welcoming the birth of the constitution of the People's Republic of China with increased production and improved work.

Our constitution has no empty words or empty talk, and such a constitution can be implemented and must be implemented. I wholeheartedly support and am satisfied with this constitution, and I propose that the National People's Congress adopt this constitution. After the constitution is adopted, we should set an example by abiding by and implementing this constitution. The constitution proposes a code of conduct for all citizens of our country: abiding by the constitution is the duty of citizens of the People's Republic of China and the minimum condition for being a citizen; on the contrary, violating the constitution is disrupting national order and public interests, and it will be subject to legal sanctions and be despised by the people. Abiding by the constitution, ensuring the implementation of the constitution, and not allowing any behavior that violates the constitution is the correct political attitude that our citizens must take towards the constitution.

In the past five years, our country's achievements in all aspects have been extremely great, which is the result of the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, and it is also the result of the united efforts of the people of the entire country. I will not elaborate on the achievements we have already made, nor will I predict the greater achievements we may achieve in the future. For the implementation of the constitution, I would like to point out the main shortcomings that should be corrected in the current work of various levels of government.

First of all, I think that because of the great achievements in our work, we ignore the serious shortcomings and mistakes that still exist in our work, which is very bad. Due to the lack of development of criticism and self-criticism, some government officials still lack the cultivation and habit of accepting the supervision of the masses. Therefore, from the Central People's Government to various levels of local people's governments, some department heads and some responsible persons are not good at listening to the opinions of the people, do not respect the democratic rights of the people, and indeed still have a bureaucratic attitude of indifference towards the hardships of the people's lives. Especially some government heads and department heads cannot actively criticize and expose their own shortcomings and mistakes, still have the bad habit of liking flattery, praising, fearing criticism, or rejecting criticism, and thus cannot approach the masses and obtain the help of the masses. This makes it difficult to correct mistakes and improve work in a timely and thorough manner, and it is difficult not to weaken our connection with the masses. We should seize the opportunity to implement the constitution to further strengthen our connection with the masses. People's representatives and government officials at all levels should set an example by abiding by the constitution, and fight against any behavior that violates the constitution without mercy. At the same time, we should vigorously publicize the constitution and, according to the spirit of the constitution, organize and mobilize the masses to criticize and inspect the government's work, while government officials at all levels should humbly accept the criticism of the masses to improve their work. In this way, the democratic sun will shine on every dark corner, and the bureaucratic habits in our government work will be constantly corrected, and the socialist construction of New China will achieve greater progress.

I, as one of the people's representatives, and at the same time, one of the main responsible persons of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, am willing to correct the shortcomings and mistakes I have exposed in Shanghai's work and, with such practice, support the constitution, support the National People's Congress, support the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and support the Central People's Government.

Wang Yun Sheng's Speech:

I am now speaking about the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China, and I feel extremely excited and greatly honored.

Since March this year, I have participated in the discussion of the initial draft of the draft constitution. In the past half year, I have seen the draft constitution change four times, extensively absorbing everyone's opinions and making meticulous revisions. Now it is almost perfect and will soon become the most practical, ideal, and perfect constitution for China's transitional period.

The constitution guarantees every citizen's various basic rights and requires every citizen to use their rights well in their work, life, and thoughts. Combining my personal profession, I have two thoughts:

First, Article 87 of the draft constitution stipulates that "citizens of the People's Republic of China have the freedom of speech, publication..." Our country urgently needs to carry out a healthy and vigorous criticism and self-criticism. However, the situation in the past five years of building the country is that our speech work often lags behind reality and lacks a vigorous and powerful critical atmosphere. This situation, we speech workers should first criticize ourselves, that we have not been conscientious and responsible, resulting in our speech work being weak and powerless, and newspapers being dull and lifeless. Another reason is that there is still some bureaucracy within us. Bureaucracy lacks the attitude of accepting good advice. Our country has made great progress and achieved a lot, which is recognized by the world; at the same time, some people have become arrogant and complacent, not only do they not encourage speech criticism but even resist criticism. Of course, this situation is not universal and is not very serious, but it must be noted and corrected. Speech workers should, under the protection of the constitution, grasp the right of free speech, be conscientious and responsible, and carry out a healthy and vigorous criticism and self-criticism for the country.

Second, Article 95 of the draft constitution stipulates that "the People's Republic of China guarantees the freedom of citizens to engage in scientific research, literary and artistic creation, and other cultural activities." The situation in the past five years is that politics has made great progress, the economy is catching up, and culture is even more catching up. In the cultural sector, there is a particular lack of creative work. Novels and scripts are rare; general articles of discussion are mostly turned over and over, clichés and clichés; newspaper news writing is filled with a fixed format and a fixed tune. This style of writing is a serious eight-part, formulaic, and monotonous. It should be pointed out that after liberation, the style of writing is careful in words and correct in reasoning, which is good; but generally, people like to write long sentences that are full of repetitions and quotations, writing dry and emotionless articles, and a lack of eight-part formulas, with few people daring to make creative attempts. First of all, it is me myself, who has not written anything lively and powerful, and there are few good articles in the Daguo Daily. Such a style of writing, compared with the rapid development of our country's situation, is extremely unmatched. The draft constitution wants "the state to encourage and assist the creative work of citizens engaged in scientific, educational, literary, artistic, and other cultural undertakings." We cultural workers should not disappoint the state's encouragement and assistance and create a new style of writing for New China.

I enthusiastically support the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China and enthusiastically support Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report. I propose that the conference solemnly adopt this constitution. We adopt this constitution, solemnly declaring that 600 million people will take the socialist road, solemnly declaring that 600 million people will adhere to the unshakable policy of striving for the lofty goals of world peace and human progress. This is a historic event of great significance in the world.

As a representative, I guarantee: I will definitely be loyal to the people's democratic system, abide by the constitution and laws, and strive to serve the people; I will definitely insist on learning and working hard at my post without falling behind.

### 在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上  代表们关于宪法草案和报告的发言

    在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上
    代表们关于宪法草案和报告的发言
    林伯渠代表的发言各位代表：
    中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，将庄严地通过中华人民共和国宪法，这是我们国家的大喜事，是全国人民的大喜事，也是我们在全世界一切国家中的朋友们的大喜事。
    这个宪法，是一百多年来，尤其是近三十多年来，中国人民反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的革命胜利的总结，是中华人民共和国成立以来建国的经验的总结，是我国通过和平的道路建成社会主义社会的保证。
    这个宪法在制定的过程中，中国各族人民都热烈地参加了讨论的。它既是领导者的经验和广大人民群众的经验的结合，又是中国的经验和苏联及其他人民民主国家的经验的结合。
    宪法草案规定了中华人民共和国的一切权力属于人民，人民行使权力的机关是全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会；规定了全国人民代表大会是最高国家权力机关和行使国家立法权的唯一机关；规定了全国人民代表大会、地方各级人民代表大会和其他国家机关一律实行民主集中制；规定了人民代表受原选举单位和选民的监督；规定了一切国家机关工作人员必须努力为人民服务；规定了国家武装力量属于人民，它的任务是保卫人民革命和国家建设的成果，保卫国家的主权、领土完整和安全。宪法草案的各个部分，都贯彻着国内各民族间平等友爱互助合作的精神。所有这些有关政治制度和国家制度的规定，都是中国人民政治生活中实际经验的总结，现在以法律的形式把它们固定下来了。
    宪法草案指明了我国正处在逐步过渡到社会主义社会的历史时期，反映了我们国家在过渡时期的根本要求和全国人民建设社会主义社会的共同愿望。它规定了国家在过渡时期的总任务，指出了实现总任务的内外条件，并规定了中国人民为此而奋斗的道路。这些规定，是完全以中国现有的社会情况为根据的。由于中国工人阶级的领导和广大劳动人民的努力，社会主义因素在国家的政治和经济方面已经成为决定性的领导力量，这就决定了逐步过渡到社会主义社会已经是我国存在着的和向前发展的必然趋势；同时，又由于非社会主义经济成份的大量存在，和社会主义经济的发展还赶不上广大人民生活需要的事实，对现存的各种非社会主义所有制的改造，就必须逐步进行，区别对待。只有由国家保证优先发展国营经济，即全民所有制的社会主义经济，才能加强国民经济中的领导力量和扩大实现社会主义改造的物质基础。只有依靠国家机关采取行政上的具体措施，并使之与广大人民群众的社会主义觉悟和积极行动结合起来，才能逐步实现社会主义改造，逐步消灭剥削制度，建立社会主义社会。几年来，我们正是遵循着这些原则来进行的。这是中国人民经济生活中实际经验的总结，现在也以法律的形式把它们固定下来了。
    中华人民共和国建国以来的各项措施的伟大成就，已经使整个中国社会在各方面都发生了深刻的根本的变化。人民的物质、文化生活水平已经比解放以前有了显著的提高，人民的各项自由权利已经开始得到了物质上的保证。但是我们还是刚从贫困落后的旧中国的废墟上建立不久的新国家，我们的社会主义建设事业和社会主义改造的事业也刚在有计划地进行，国家财富的积累还不够充裕。因此，应当说，目前我们国家对于公民的各项基本权利的物质保证，还是不充分的。应当指出，发展经济建设是改善人民生活的前提，那种不顾经济建设的利益、过高过急地要求改善人民生活的意见是不正确的；也应当指出，在我们国家机关的工作人员中还有一些人对于在可能条件下改善人民生活采取官僚主义的漠不关心的态度，甚至违法乱纪，侵害人民的基本权利，也是不对的，是我们所必须坚决反对的。
    全国各族人民，无论在工厂中，在农村中，在学校、机关中，以及在其他各个岗位上，正欢欣鼓舞地以实际行动来迎接中华人民共和国宪法的诞生。我们坚决相信，在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党领导下，在人民有了自己的宪法以后，人民群众的积极性和创造性一定会进一步地更加发挥。我们必须同全国人民一起，继续加强团结，为彻底实现国家在过渡时期的总任务，把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家而努力奋斗！
    李济深代表的发言主席、诸位代表：
    我完全同意“中华人民共和国宪法草案”，并且完全同意刘少奇委员所作关于宪法草案的报告。在这时候，我的心情非常激动。我不能不想到一百多年来无数的仁人志士的艰苦斗争和他们所流的鲜血。而今天，我们代表全国六万万人民来庄严地通过中华人民共和国宪法，这是说明了我们的革命先驱者和现代中国人民革命斗争已得到伟大的胜利果实。
    这个宪法草案，曾经各方面的代表人物八千多人参加了起草工作，在广大的国土上掀起了千百万人热烈讨论的高潮，集中了全中国人民的智慧和意见，它的全部内容和每一个条文都贯串着真正的民主主义的精神；它总结了过去和现在革命斗争的经验，指出来一条不能反对的真理，就是我们中国只有走社会主义的道路。
    然而社会主义不是我们坐着等待就可以实现的。在过去几年中，我们在各方面已经取得了惊人的成就，这是谁也不能抹煞的事实。但工作中也不是没有缺点和错误的。例如：在国家机关中有些工作人员脱离群众，违法乱纪，有损政府的威信。又如，在建设事业中，也有因为不经过详细的调查研究，没有周密的计划或者好大喜功、盲目冒进以致造成国家的损失，这些缺点和错误，那怕是较小的、个别的，今后也必须坚决改正。
    什么是合法而必须执行的？什么是非法而必须禁止的？宪法草案已经明白规定了。那么，我们制定了宪法之后，第一个要求就是严格地遵守宪法和积极地执行宪法。宪法是我们的有力武器，我们应该用它来保卫和发展胜利的成果，用它来克服消灭一切错误和缺点。因此，我建议展开一个全国规模的学习宪法、宣传宪法的运动，使得每一个人都能够遵守宪法，执行宪法，接受社会主义改造，提高政治觉悟，克服个人主义，一心一意，永远跟着共产党前进。
    宪法给我们充分的权利，也交给我们重大的任务。首先使我想到的是美帝国主义所侵占的我国领土台湾。台湾一天不解放，我们的领土一天得不到完整，中国的安全和世界的和平就一天受着威胁。今天，我们不能不以没有台湾省人民普选的代表在座为缺憾。我们不能不想到我们的人民解放军正在前方英勇作战。我们沿海前线的居民和台湾海峡的渔民，正在不断的遭到蒋匪的轰炸和残杀，我们更不能忘记还有八百万同胞在蒋介石卖国贼的压迫下受着水深火热的痛苦。为了保卫国家主权领土的完整和安全，我们一定要解放台湾！
    我在这里发言，怀抱着充分的信心。我们有以毛主席为首的中国共产党的领导，有已经巩固还要继续发挥作用的人民民主统一战线，我们这个全国人民大团结建设社会主义的宪法，一定能够完全实现。正如毛主席在大会开幕时所昭示我们的，我们一定能够把我们的国家建设成为一个伟大的社会主义共和国。
    王崇伦代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我能参加全国人民代表大会，参加对中华人民共和国宪法草案的讨论，感到非常光荣。在我们的宪法草案中规定了公民有劳动的权利、劳动者有休息的权利，规定了劳动是光荣的事情，规定了工人阶级的领导地位和建设社会主义的奋斗目标，这就巩固了中国人民过去的斗争成果，指明了今后的光明道路。我坚决拥护这个宪法草案和刘少奇同志关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告。
    自中华人民共和国成立以后，我国工人的政治地位和社会地位有了根本的改变，我们工人当家作了主人，我们在为建设自己的幸福生活而劳动着。因为我们是为自己和自己的国家劳动，所以劳动的劲头特别大，生产效率不断地提高，我们的生活也随着有了改善。这些都是我亲身体会到的。在党的教育和培养下，我和全国工人兄弟们一样，看到了社会主义的美好前景，认识到我们工人阶级的重大责任，下定决心要努力学习，为祖国、为社会主义事业贡献出一切力量。
    全国的工人弟兄们在生产岗位上已经做出很大的成绩，可是国家建设需要我们做出更多的成绩；而要做出更多的成绩是要依靠党的领导和集体的力量的。离开党的领导，离开集体主义，个人的力量是很有限的。我在工作中间曾经有过一点贡献，可是也遇到过很多困难。没有党的领导和大家的帮助，我就无法克服这些困难。党随时都提醒我：困难就是考验，坚持就是胜利，有决心就能成功。领导上还专门作出决议来帮助我，长辈的工人和技术人员们都很热心地来协助我，因此“万能工具胎”才在集体的力量下创造成功，使工作效率提高了六倍。我想全国各地的成千上万的技术革新者，也都是在党的领导和大家的帮助下才得到成功的。显然这些集体智慧所创造的事迹，在旧社会是决不可能发生的，只有在人民做了国家的主人之后才能发生。这正表现着人民民主制度的优越性。
    有一点意见，我想在这里提出来。就是：我深深地感到过多的社会活动对于劳动模范是一个很大的负担。社会活动太多了，生产和学习的时间就减少了，这样下去，模范不了多久就不模范了。我想工、农业劳动模范同志们都会有这样的感觉。希望政府、工会和其他有关部门能够适当地解决这个问题。
    中华人民共和国宪法的制定，将使我国的人民民主制度更加完备和巩固，我们今后要更加提高自己的觉悟，遵守劳动纪律，发挥积极性和创造性，保证完成和超额完成国家计划，保证宪法的实施，并誓为解放台湾奋斗到底！
    张澜代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意中华人民共和国宪法草案和刘少奇委员关于宪法草案的报告。
    六十年以来，中国的宪政运动，我是亲身经历过的。就我自己的经验，过去反动统治者所谓宪政，从制宪的过程到“宪法”的内容，都是骗人的，因而都是为人民所蔑视和反对的。
    由于中国共产党领导的新民主主义革命的胜利，中国人民才走上了光明幸福的大道；今天才有了这个真正民主的宪法。这个宪法是用民主的方式产生的，从中央人民政府委员会到全国每个角落，经过了许多次的讨论，吸收了一切好的意见，真正做到了字斟句酌，尽善尽美。所以这个宪法是符合广大人民的共同愿望，而为全国人民所一致赞成和热烈拥护的。
    中华人民共和国宪法的得来是不容易的。有了这个宪法以后，全国人民必须作更大的努力，才能在我们伟大的祖国建成社会主义的新社会。
    为了彻底实施这个宪法，必须要全国人民共同努力。首先，应当在全国范围内普遍展开关于宪法的宣传、学习，务求做到家喻户晓。宪法是国家根本大法，从中央到地方，从政府到人民，都要切实遵行，共同信守。我们全国人民代表大会的全体代表，都亲自参加了这个庄严的制宪会议，更应当以身作则，严格遵守宪法，并担负起监督宪法实施的重大责任。以中国共产党为领导的各民主阶级、各民主党派和各人民团体，都要共同负责，以保证宪法的彻底实施。
    五年以来，我们的国家在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，在政治、经济、文化各方面，都有了辉煌的成就。但是应当承认，在我们的各种工作中还存在着个别的缺点和错误。正是因为这样，几年来，我们曾经和官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪的现象作不断的斗争。现在宪法颁布以后，一切国家机关工作人员，都必须以宪法为准绳，克服这些缺点和错误，勤勤恳恳地为人民服务。
    当全国人民热烈庆祝宪法颁布的时候，我特别想起台湾同胞还在水深火热之中。全国人民一定要更坚强地团结起来，解放台湾，消灭蒋匪，保卫国土完整，断不容许美国侵略集团的干涉！
    韩恩代表的发言主席、各位代表、各位同志：
    这次召开全国人民代表大会，通过中华人民共和国宪法，是我国人民的一件大喜事。我能够做个代表参加这样重大的会议，感到非常高兴。农民参加管理国家大事，制定国家宪法，这是自古以来没有的。只有在共产党和毛主席的领导下，我们农民才能有今天这样的好日子。
    我是吉林省蛟河县保安屯农业生产合作社主任。去年冬天，我们农民知道了国家过渡时期的总任务，生产情绪更加高涨了，社会主义这盏明灯把大家的心照亮了。我们亲眼看见，许多大工厂正在建设，新农具和化学肥料越来越多地运到农村里，听说还正在建设拖拉机工厂。将来用机器种地，像我们所看到的许多国营农场一样，耕的深，长的好，打的粮食就会更多。
    今年六月，宪法草案公布以后，我们农民讨论了这个宪法草案，生产的劲头更大了。宪法巩固了我国革命胜利的果实和土地改革的果实，宪法也保证了我们的国家一步一步地过渡到社会主义。宪法上面规定发展合作社是改造个体农业的主要道路，这完全代表了我们广大农民的意思。要大家富裕，只有走合作化这条道路，这一点我们农民是越来越明白了。我们保安屯在解放以前是有名的“穷棒子”屯，共产党来了，农民分了土地，又组织了互助组，到一九五二年成立起农业生产合作社。当年虽然遭受灾害，合作社仍然保证了丰收；所以有更多的农民要求入社，到年底就发展到四十七户，现在我们的合作社已经发展到一百零七户，有水旱田一百六十垧，合关内二千四百亩，今年能打一百二十万斤粮食。我们计算：除了缴十三万斤公粮，留下明年的种籽和社员的吃粮以外，还可以卖给国家七十万斤粮食。今年我们已经按照公平合理的价格卖给国家两万个鸡蛋和一万二千多斤猪肉，秋后还要卖给国家七千多斤猪肉和五千多斤牛肉。
    我们这个合作社成立两年以来，就栽种了四千多棵果树和十万多棵普通的树木，修了一个一垧大的养鱼池，下了两万条鱼苗。因为生产发展了，社员的收入一年比一年增加，生活一年比一年改善；单是社员自己住的房子，两年来就新盖了四十间，合作社公共仓库和牲口棚等等还不在内。社员的文化也提高了，一般社员能认识三五百字，并且还都在继续学习。像我们这样的农业生产合作社，在吉林省还有不少，在全国就更多了。可是，我们的社还是有很多缺点的。对于新农具的作用还没有充分发挥出来；积肥数量虽多，但质量较差；个别老社员在扩大合作社的时候，对吸收贫困户入社不够热情。我们还要向别的社学习，把我们的社办得更好，更进一步发展生产。
    这些好处，都是共产党和毛主席领导我们赶走帝国主义，打垮国民党反动派，分土地，组织互助合作才得来的，也是跟工人老大哥的帮助、工业的发展分不开的。所以，我们农民热烈拥护这个保证社会主义建设的宪法；大会通过这个宪法以后，我们一定用自己的劳动生产，来保证这个宪法所规定的目标早一天实现。
    萧龙友代表的发言
    我这一次被选为代表，感觉到无上光荣。我们国家从前也几次立宪，但均是为政府的便利即是为地主阶级、资产阶级服务，借以欺骗人民。从未和各族在平等自由及互利互惠上着想。此次全国人民代表大会所有代表均系从真正民意选出。为各族兄弟般平等自由之实现，成为一个大家庭，故凡大家庭互助互利之规模及其制度均载在宪法中，而于卫生的事业及医药的发展均依照毛主席的指示，一一说明。我本人愿追随中西医同人，将我祖国宝贵文化遗产，结合科学从中整理，使我国有数千年临床经验的医学达到发扬光大的地步，使我国广大的劳动者人人都能享受保健的权利。其办法，我主张必须同时创办中医大学和中医医院，俾使学习和临床同时互有经验，否则不易收到良好效用。这是我主要的建议，至于其他一切，可于开会后随时补充，以期中西交流，以期人民健康，共为国家建设努力前进。然则此种宪法可信为全国人民共同遵守履行之宪法，亦即为神圣不可侵犯之宪法，吾愿我们代表和全国人民共尊重之。我是医界中人，故立言如此，望大家指教。
    林枫代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案，完全同意刘少奇同志代表中华人民共和国宪法起草委员会向大会所作的关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告。
    中华人民共和国宪法草案总结了中国人民长期革命斗争的经验，给全国人民指明了前进的道路，规定了我们国家过渡到社会主义社会的总方针总任务，给了全国人民以无限的信心和力量。中华人民共和国宪法草案经过全国人民的讨论，集中了全国人民的智慧，充分表达了我国人民建设社会主义社会的共同愿望。我们确信，这个宪法草案的通过和颁布，必将得到全国人民的热烈拥护。
    我们的宪法是人民民主的宪法，是把我国建设成为社会主义社会的宪法。我以为，根据宪法草案的精神来看一看东北地区的建设事业是有意义的。几年来，东北地区如同全国其他地区一样，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的正确领导和关怀下，在全国的支援、苏联的帮助以及全体劳动人民的努力下，克服了许多困难，进行了巨大的工作，各种建设事业有了很大的发展。在工业建设方面，我们已经建设了或者正在建设着许多新的企业，逐渐地生产我国过去所不能生产的新产品。一九五三年，东北地区的工业生产总值等于一九四九年的百分之四百四十四点八，一九四九年大型工业生产总值占工农业生产总值的百分之三十七点六，到一九五三年，已经上升到百分之六十一点二。在农业生产方面也有所提高，农业生产互助合作组织在一九五三年已占总农户的百分之七十三点八。其他各项建设事业也都有了相应的发展。东北地区的情况充分说明了，工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主制度的优越性，也证明了中国人民能够胜利地完成我们国家的社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的伟大历史任务。但同时，根据宪法草案的精神来检查一下东北地区的工作，我们可以看到是有很多的缺点和错误的，这主要表现在贯彻人民民主制度和发扬民主还不够充分，对人民群众和干部的政治工作、思想教育工作，特别在政治工作和经济工作的结合上还做得不够，对于资本主义工商业的社会主义改造工作也注意得不够。我们有些干部特别是少数领导干部的骄傲自满情绪还很严重，甚至有的人自以为“先进”，自以为“特殊”，对于他所领导的工作批评不得，检查不得，不虚心或者不注意学习其他地区的经验。这些错误虽然已经受到了严格的批判和制止，但仍须在今后的工作中进一步地加以克服和纠正。为了胜利地完成我国的社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的任务，我们必须更加紧密地团结在中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府的周围，认真贯彻宪法草案所规定的一切原则，特别要依靠人民群众，发扬民主，进一步贯彻人民民主制度；加强集中统一领导的思想，加强整体观念和国家观念以及服从国家的统一的建设计划。对于一切分散主义和地方主义都必须及时地加以反对和纠正。
    各位代表！我们的祖国正在向着美满的社会主义社会迈进，我们的前途是光明的，但我们的任务是艰巨的，我们一定要遵照毛主席的指示，戒骄戒躁，谦虚谨慎，密切联系群众，虚心学习，首先要向苏联学习，努力克服前进道路上的一切障碍和工作中的缺点错误，为保证宪法的贯彻，为胜利地完成我们国家的社会主义建设，为胜利地解放台湾而努力奋斗。
    最后，我提议我们的大会正式通过中华人民共和国宪法草案。庆祝我们大会的胜利成功。
    周文江代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我国真正代表人民意志的宪法，就要在这个庄严无比的大会上通过了。我们军队同志感到非常兴奋。我国的宪法是团结全国人民建设幸福的社会主义社会的宪法，今天能够胜利制定，是一件很不容易的事情。宪法的许多条文，条条都是全国人民和我们军队经过长期艰苦斗争，用我们无数同志的鲜血和生命换来的。因此我们特别爱护它，一定要以实际行动来拥护它。
    现在全国人民都在热烈庆祝全国人民代表大会第一次会议的召开，都在庆祝人民自己的宪法的产生。但是我们同时不能不想到：台湾八百万同胞，他们还不能和我们一样选举自己的代表，出席自己的大会，行使自己的权力；他们现在还被踩在蒋介石卖国贼的脚底下，翻不过身来。我们是人民的军队，我们的神圣任务是保卫人民革命和国家建设的成果，保卫国家的安全和领土的完整。解放台湾，我们军队担负了直接的责任。我们一定不辜负全国人民的希望，一定解放台湾，完成宪法赋予我们的光荣任务。
    我们军队同志时刻都记着朱总司令在今年建军节讲的话。朱总司令很严肃地说：蒋贼军一天不消灭，台湾一天不解放，我们中国人民和中国人民解放军就一天没有洗掉自己身上的耻辱，就没有一点值得骄傲的地方。这些话的意思就是教训我们：我们一天不消灭蒋贼，一天不解放台湾，我们军队就没有完成自己应尽的责任。所以我们正在一面加紧战斗准备，一面积极行动起来。我们一定要收复台湾，让祖国的五星红旗飘扬在台湾所有的土地上，让宪法的光芒照耀到台湾每一个同胞的身上，让我们受尽苦难的台湾父老、兄弟、姊妹，和我们一样都能过自由幸福的生活！
    达赖喇嘛·丹增嘉措代表的发言毛主席、各位代表：
    今天在祖国的首都——北京举行的第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上将要庄严地制定中华人民共和国宪法，这是符合全国各民族利益的事情。关于少数民族方面：宪法草案总结了几年来执行毛主席的民族平等、民族团结政策的成绩和经验。特别是宪法草案上规定了各民族可以按照它的发展特点制定自治条例和单行条例，以充分行使自治权利。此外，宪法草案又明白地规定“国家在经济建设和文化建设的过程中将照顾各民族的需要，而在社会主义改造的问题上将充分注意各民族发展的特点”。这都是非常正确的，我们西藏全体人民热烈地表示拥护。西藏在过去很长的历史时期中受着国内历代反动政府的压迫，特别是由于外国帝国主义的挑拨离间，以致和祖国的关系，曾经有一个时期疏远了一些。但是，自从一九五一年签订和平解放西藏办法的协议，中央代表、进藏人民解放军及工作干部先后到达西藏以后，执行了中央的民族团结政策，遵守和执行了和平解放西藏办法协议十七条，这些正确的政策和其他各项措施，都是可以清楚的看得到的。与此同时，由于三年多以来，先后从西藏地方派出了几次参观团、致敬团来到祖国内地，他们回到西藏以后，将所了解的祖国内地的情况，作了宣传解释，因而逐步解除了西藏人民的疑虑。中国各兄弟民族，特别是汉藏民族正在日益走向亲密团结之中。班禅额尔德尼能回返西藏和我相会，也进一步加强了西藏内部的团结。根据毛主席的各民族间与各民族内部应该团结的政策，在西藏业已出现了新的和平友爱的气象。
    关于宗教方面：在敌人的各种挑拨离间中，主要的一项，就是造谣共产党、人民政府毁灭宗教。西藏人民具有很浓厚的宗教信仰，这些谣言，曾经使他们疑虑不安，但是现在“共产党、人民政府毁灭宗教”的挑拨离间的谣言，已经全部破产了，西藏人民已经切身地体会到了他们在宗教信仰上是有自由的。
    关于西藏的经济、文化建设方面：西藏过去因为交通不便，进行经济、文化建设都很困难，但是在中央的大力帮助之下，三年多以来，开辟了不少荒地，建立了人民银行，对农业、畜牧业、手工业发放贷款，高价收购难以外销的羊毛，因而促进了西藏经济的发展。其次，又建立了学校、医院，以培养藏族干部，发展文化。在进行经济建设上特别值得指出的是：中央拨了巨额经费，修筑康藏公路，筑路人员在崇山峻岭及流水急湍的河流上不顾一切危险，努力地进行工作。这条公路，预计在今年年底就可以通车到拉萨。这不仅是建设繁荣新西藏的基础，而且在保卫国防上具有重大的意义。
    最近，后藏一部分地区发生了水灾，中央得知后，立即拨款八十亿元救济灾区人民。最近我国和印度签订的中印两国关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定，完全反映了西藏地区人民的意愿，获得西藏地区人民的拥护。所有这一切，都具体地表现了中央对西藏和西藏人民的深切关怀，同时，也显示出我们祖国的强大。
    目前在西藏，根据和平解放西藏办法的协议，西藏地方政府和僧俗人民大力帮助人民解放军购置粮食，支援交通运输等。十七条协议正在实行之中，以便使西藏的政治、经济进一步走向良好发展的道路。但是由于历史上多年来反动统治时期施行民族压迫政策所造成的民族隔阂的残余尚未消除干净，西藏人民大众对祖国的情况还不够熟悉等所引起的一些缺陷，已在不断地改进中。进藏人民解放军和工作干部的大公无私的一切措施，归根到底，都是为了藏族人民的利益，这是我们所深切了解的。但是个别细小问题，主要是由于语言的隔阂，以及不了解风俗习惯等原因而发生的一些微小的错误，说明情况后，当即改正了。今后我们彼此将要毫无顾虑地进行批评讨论，特别是在先进的汉民族的帮助之下，在我们各民族敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的领导之下，我们有坚强的信心，遵守宪法，执行十七条协议，逐步把西藏建设成为一个政教昌盛繁荣幸福的地方。
    最后让我祝贺：
    出席大会的各位代表的健康！
    祝贺大会的胜利和圆满的成功！
    郝建秀代表的发言主席、各位代表：
      制定宪法是全国人民最大的喜事。我能够参加全国人民代表大会来讨论宪法草案，心里感到非常光荣和高兴。我认为宪法草案的每一章，每一条、每一句，都是完完全全符合全国劳动人民的利益和愿望的，我坚决拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案和刘少奇同志关于宪法草案的报告。我建议大会一致通过这个宪法草案。
    宪法草案的第一条就明确地规定了：“中华人民共和国是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家”。宪法草案规定了我国通过社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的道路，逐步消灭剥削制度，建立社会主义社会。“这个宪法巩固了我国人民革命的成果和中华人民共和国建立以来政治上、经济上的新胜利，并且反映了国家在过渡时期的根本要求和广大人民建设社会主义社会的共同愿望。”我们工人阶级一定要在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，团结全国人民，为巩固我国人民民主专政和在我国实现繁荣幸福的社会主义社会而奋斗。
    宪法草案中规定了公民的基本权利和义务，并明确地指出：“劳动是中华人民共和国一切有劳动能力的公民的光荣的事情。国家鼓励公民在劳动中的积极性和创造性。”妇女和青年也受到国家的亲切关怀。我是一个工人，同时又是一个妇女和青年，我深深体会到国家对我们劳动人民的爱护和关怀是无微不至的。我衷心地感谢共产党、感谢毛主席所带给我们的幸福。回想解放前，我们工人到处被人瞧不起，纺织工人被人叫作是“吃花毛的”。我小的时候拾煤渣，人家叫我“小黑鬼”。为了生活，我几乎跑遍了青岛所有的纺织厂，人家都不要我。现在，劳动成了光荣的事情，我们工人还能够进学校学习。我亲身体验到作为一个中华人民共和国的劳动人民是多么光荣、多么幸福。我因此更加热爱我们的祖国。但是，我们的台湾同胞还在美国帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团的残酷统治下，我们一定要解放台湾同胞，完成祖国的解放事业。
    今天，我们中国人民能够制定自己的宪法，这是无数革命先辈英勇奋斗的成果。我们工人阶级一定要巩固和发展这个胜利成果。我们要以实际行动，坚决保卫宪法，成为遵守宪法的模范。我们要严格地遵守劳动纪律，充分地发挥工人阶级的积极性和创造性，学习苏联的先进经验，提高政治、文化和技术的水平，积极参加劳动竞赛，保证全面完成国家计划。我现在在学校学习，我保证坚决响应毛主席
  “身体好，学习好，工作好”的号召，学好数学、物理、化学等基础知识，为进一步地掌握高级的科学技术知识打好基础。将来毕业后，我一定同全国人民一道，贡献我所有的力量，把我们的祖国建设成为繁荣幸福的社会主义的国家。
    邓颖超代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我对中华人民共和国宪法草案和刘少奇同志关于宪法草案的报告完全同意。
    我们国家的根本大法——中华人民共和国宪法，即将在我国第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上通过。这个宪法给全国人民和后代子孙带来了无限美好的幸福的前途，并将给妇女们带来彻底的解放。今后摆在全国人民面前的任务，就是要严格地遵守宪法，坚决为实现宪法而不懈地奋斗。
    我现在仅就宪法草案第三章中有关婚姻、家庭、母亲、儿童受到国家保护的一款，简略地提出一些意见。
    中华人民共和国成立后的五年来，根据中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领关于实行婚姻自由、保护母亲、儿童的规定，采取了一系列的重大措施：公布了婚姻法和劳动保险条例，政府有些部门及有关团体还从各个方面制订了保护母亲、儿童的具体办法，并依靠社会力量做了不少的保护婚姻、母婴和教育幼儿的具体工作。随着国家经济的恢复和发展，有关妇女、儿童的物质和文化设施，也有了显著的增进，使广大劳动妇女日益能够安心地积极地从事生产和工作，使儿童们能够愉快地成长，过着日益幸福的生活。现在，宪法草案上又明确地规定
  “婚姻、家庭、母亲和儿童受国家的保护。”这必将鼓舞妇女们不断地提高爱国主义热情，进一步发挥她们在生产劳动上的积极性，从而有利于社会主义建设事业的推进。在宪法上规定这一款，正标志着社会主义性质的宪法的特点，充分地显示了我国人民民主制度的优越性。
    要贯彻这一款，首先必须树立男女平等、尊重母性、爱护儿童的社会主义道德观，并使它逐步成为社会道德在这方面的普遍标准。这就是说，在保护婚姻方面：凡是合乎婚姻法的婚姻，必须受到保护；凡是为了挣脱痛苦的封建婚姻，为婚姻自由而斗争的，必须给予支持和保护；凡是曲解婚姻自由或压制婚姻自由的，应按情节轻重，给予教育或制裁，对于那些违反婚姻法的事件，社会舆论应给以谴责，严重的还应受到法律的制裁。在保护家庭方面：提倡和保护团结生产、民主和睦的家庭，改造封建落后的家庭。在保护母亲方面：提倡尊重母亲并关怀和协助母亲解决在劳动中所遇到的困难和阻碍，反对对母亲的歧视。在保护儿童方面：提倡尊重儿童，爱护儿童，采取适合于儿童的教育方法，既不应以成人的观点和要求来对待儿童，也不应溺爱和姑息儿童；对于现在还相当普遍存在着的轻视和不关心儿童，甚至对儿童还采取体罚的现象，必须不断地给以纠正。要严格警惕封建思想残余和资产阶级思想沾染儿童。我们要用社会主义的思想教育儿童，养成他们爱好劳动和爱好集体生活的习惯，使儿童成为体、智、德、美全面发展的新人。与此同时，还必须在国家经济和文化发展的基础上，实事求是地逐步增进关于保护母亲和儿童的各项措施，使之与国家建设事业相适应。任何离开现实的可能，提出过高的要求，或者条件可能而不积极去做的偏向，都是不对的。总之，对婚姻、家庭、母亲和儿童的保护，是整个国家、整个社会、全体公民的共同职责，更是父母们光荣的责任。对此，一般人甚至有些父母都还认识不足，我们妇女团体也缺乏足够的工作。今后我们要努力克服过去的缺点，并希望有关方面积极地进行宣传和加强这方面的工作。
    我们相信，在中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府的领导下，全国男女公民必将满怀信心地为建设社会主义社会，为世界和平和人类进步的崇高目的而努力奋斗。
    沈克非代表的发言主席团、各位代表先生：
    我以一个从事科学研究的医师的地位，向大会发言。
    经过了全民讨论和反复修正之后，中华人民共和国宪法，就要在这个庄严的大会上通过和公布了。我除了衷心拥护和完全同意这个宪法之外，还想从一个科学工作者的立场，讲几点特殊的、切身的体会。
    第一、这个宪法是社会主义类型的宪法。但是，它却从中国的实际出发，和中国的实际相结合，完全贯彻了实事求是的科学精神。它既表达了中国人民要走社会主义道路的理想和愿望，又总结了中国人民革命和建设的实际经验，有美好的理想，又有切实的步骤，因此，这个宪法是合理而又合用的宪法。
    第二、科学技术的发展和社会主义建设，这两者之间有着不能分开的相互关系。没有高度发展的科学技术不能完成社会主义工业化，而国家经济建设的发展，又给科学技术的进步创造了有利的条件。我们的宪法用明确的文字规定了国家保障公民进行科学研究、文学艺术和其他文化活动的自由，对从事科学、教育、文学、艺术和其他文化事业的公民的创造性工作，给以鼓励和帮助。我们从旧社会挣扎过来的科学工作者，深切地感觉到只有在社会主义类型的国家里，科学技术才能受到这样的重视和支持。
    解放五年以来，中国医药卫生事业已经有了划时代的进步和改革。共产党和人民政府从掌握政权的第一天开始，就用极大的力量，领导、教育和帮助医务工作者改造思想，加强学习，为改善人民群众的卫生状况而努力。在解放以前，我们祖国一直被认为是不讲卫生、疫病流行、死亡率很高的国家。可是就在这解放后短短的时期之内，这种情况已经有了基本的变化。我们感谢共产党和人民政府的这种正确领导。我们完全相信，几个五年计划之后，我们祖国一定能够成为一个医学科学最发达、人民生活最幸福的国家。
    我们是清醒的科学工作者，因此，我们一方面确认医药卫生工作的巨大成就，另一方面我们不能不指出我们的工作还有缺点。举例来说，如在团结和改造科学技术工作者方面，如对中医——祖国优秀民族传统医学——的评价和在团结中西医的工作方面，都是做得不够完善或者执行得有偏差有缺点的。我们希望宪法颁布之后，根据宪法的精神，改进和加强这几方面的工作。
    各位代表先生，我再一次表示完全赞成和拥护这个宪法，并建议大会一致通过这个保证中国人民走向自由幸福的宪法。
    桑吉悦希代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护“中华人民共和国宪法草案”和刘少奇同志的报告。
    宪法草案序言中指出：“我国各民族已经团结成为一个自由平等的民族大家庭。在发扬各民族间的友爱互助、反对帝国主义、反对各民族内部的人民公敌、反对大民族主义和地方民族主义的基础上，我国的民族团结将继续加强。”几年来我们在川、康两个藏族自治区的工作实践中，证明这是完全正确的。
    民族之间和民族内部的团结，是少数民族获得进步和发展的基本条件之一。为了继续进步，更加发展，就必须从各方面加强团结。而经常地注意反对大民族主义和地方民族主义，是继续加强民族团结的主要条件之一。
    几年来，在这些方面我们是注意进行了不少工作的，因而民族团结也日益巩固和发展了。但是经验证明，大民族主义和地方民族主义的倾向，随时克服随时又可能发生，因此，必须经常注意揭发、批评和克服，只有如此，民族团结才能继续加强。
    地方民族主义在某些少数民族干部中是存在着的。有的往往从一个地区、一个民族的利益出发来考虑问题；有的甚至只顾一个地区少数人的利益，损害别一地区或别一民族人民的利益；有的不愿积极争取先进民族的帮助，不愿向先进地区学习；有的只强调享受权利，不想尽义务。这些错误的思想行为，虽然只是少数的，但它对民族团结是有损害的，它障碍着少数民族人民的进步和发展，必须在今后工作中逐步地加以克服。
    大民族主义在某些汉族干部中也是存在着的，主要表现在：有些领导部门很少注意甚至根本忽视民族地区的工作，在他们的工作日程中，没有民族工作的地位，他们对民族工作的实际情况不闻不问，甚至凭想像决定重大问题。有些工作人员不相信少数民族地区的工作是会进步的，他们误认为少数民族地区的一切都是落后的，他们往往用大民族的观点和优越感处理少数民族问题；有的不愿耐心地帮助少数民族，他们在工作中，或者是包办代替，或者是放任不管；有的不注意民族特点，不尊重少数民族的风俗习惯。这些错误倾向，虽然也是少数部门和工作人员的思想行为，但它也是不利于民族团结的，妨碍民族政策的贯彻的，也必须在今后的工作中加以克服。
    大民族主义和地方民族主义，都不是从国家整体利益出发，不是从各个民族共同利益出发的错误思想。对于这一问题，我个人过去在认识上和工作中，也有过毛病的。这种错误倾向的克服，必须采取严肃的态度，坚持谨慎稳进的方针和步骤；必须在干部中加强政治思想领导和思想建设工作；必须在干部中树立爱护祖国的思想，树立正确的国家观念和整体观念；必须加强对民族政策的学习，经常注意检查和改进工作。我相信在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的英明正确领导下，任何缺点错误，都一定能够克服，民族团结定将继续加强，我们藏族自治区的各方面也一定能够获得进步和发展。
    张治中代表的发言主席团、各位代表：
    我们这几个月来讨论了中华人民共和国宪法草案；昨天又听到刘少奇委员关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告，分析事实和解答问题都很周详，我表示完全同意。
    这个宪法草案是中国人民自己的宪法。它的内容完备而充实，它的结构谨严而明确，它的措词简练而通俗。我觉得它是具有如下的特点。
    宪法草案规定了我们国家前途的目标，指出通过社会主义工业化和社会主义改造，来逐步消灭剥削制度，建立社会主义社会。同时还具体地规定了建设社会主义社会的步骤和方法。
    宪法草案确定了我们国家的性质，是工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家。国家的一切权力属于人民，人民行使权力的机关是全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会。全国人民代表大会、地方各级人民代表大会和其他国家机关，一律实行民主集中制。
    宪法草案规定了公民的基本权利和义务。在宪法草案第三章中不厌求详地写下了属于人民自由权利的达十四条之多，充分满足了全国人民的要求和愿望。特别是规定妇女在政治的、经济的、文化的、社会的和家庭的生活各方面享有同男子平等的权利，这在几千年来妇女饱受封建压迫的情况下提出来，是非常应该的。当然，宪法草案规定的公民义务各条，都是必须遵守的。
    宪法草案对少数民族表示特别重视，除了在序言第五段和总纲第三条中明确规定各民族一律平等并加强民族团结外，还在第二章第五节以全节规定“民族自治地方的自治机关”，并特别指出“各上级国家机关应当充分保障各自治区、自治州、自治县的自治机关行使自治权，并且帮助各少数民族发展政治、经济和文化的建设事业。”这就充分保证了我国各民族能够更加团结、友爱、互助成为一个自由平等的民族大家庭。
    宪法草案指出在中国共产党领导下的人民民主统一战线，今后在动员和团结全国人民完成国家过渡时期总任务和反对国内外敌人的斗争中，将继续发挥它的作用。这对我们各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体是一个诚挚的号召和期待。
    宪法草案对外交政策的规定，除了继续发展和巩固我国同苏联、同人民民主国家、同全世界爱好和平的人民的友谊外，并根据平等、互利、互相尊重主权和领土完整的原则同任何国家建立和发展外交关系；它又特别指出：“在国际事务中，我国坚定不移的方针是为世界和平和人类进步的崇高目的而努力。”这更明确了我国今后对外政策的总方向，同时也给予帝国主义集团的造谣以有力的反击。
    从以上所指出的基本特点看，已经足够说明这是中国人民自己的宪法，是反映了建设社会主义社会的美好繁荣的远景的宪法，是符合全国人民的希望和要求、巩固人民民主制度、创造幸福的生活的宪法。它为全国人民所热烈欢迎和拥护。全国人民都深切地感谢中国共产党，感谢毛主席。大家完全明白，只有在毛主席的伟大、正确、英明的领导之下，才能取得反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的人民革命的伟大胜利，才能建立人民民主专政的中华人民共和国，才有今天这样一部民主、自由、幸福的新宪法。
    包达三代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    这三个月来，我们都反复研究了这个宪法草案，并且也提出了我们的意见。而在这个修正后的宪法草案中，我们浙江人民和浙江代表到京后所提的意见，凡是比较重要的，也都被采纳了。因此，我们不但完全赞成这个宪法草案，希望大会通过它全部的条文，并且将为它的贯彻实施而共同奋斗。这部宪法草案是完全根据人民民主制度和社会主义的原则以及中国实际情况来制定的，是今天世界上最民主最进步的宪法之一。它不但确定了我们中国的政治制度，并且也规定了我们社会发展的方向和基本步骤。在五年之前，我和其他代表一样，曾在这里讨论了中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领，并且也支持了它的通过。如果今天我们把这部宪法草案和共同纲领来比较一下，则不但一个是宪法，一个是纲领，在性质上有所区别，并且在内容上也有十分重要的发展。
    首先，我们的政治制度是更加人民民主化了。依照宪法草案的规定，我们的人民代表大会制度就正式实现了。这不能不说是我们人民民主制度的重要发展。其次，作为我们另一个最重要的发展和进步，我以为是在宪法草案中明白地规定了我们的国家走社会主义的道路。五年前我们在这里讨论共同纲领的时候，许多代表也曾提出了社会主义的前途问题，但是这句话在共同纲领中没有写进去，现在全国人民这个最大的愿望也已明白地写上去了，这不能不说是一个极重要的发展。在这之前，我们工商界中有许多人对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造未免都有些疑虑，以为以后不知将怎样了？那么今天看了这部宪法草案，我以为这种疑虑是应该可以解除了的。
    刘少奇委员关于宪法草案的报告中，对各方面的问题都解释得很详细，我这里不想多说了。但我觉得我们对于宪法的实施与贯彻中，尚有一个问题要我们很好地来注意。这就是我们中国人，受过去的反动独裁统治和社会制度不合理的影响，缺乏一种守法的观念，例如，目前在有些私营工商业者中发生的违法现象，以及在若干国家机关工作人员中发生的违法乱纪等现象，都是缺乏守法观念的表现。
    诚然，国家过渡时期总任务的提出和各级人民政府进行选举的结果，必然会大大地有助于纠正这种缺陷的，但我以为除此之外，我们还应作其他的必要的努力，而这方面的努力我们在过去是不够的。“三反”“五反”运动，固然是整了国家机关工作人员中的贪污现象和官僚主义作风，整了资产阶级的违法行为，但是这些问题不应视为已经完全解决。如果说宪法的实施是意味着我国法治的开始，那么我以为尤其重要的是一般人民，特别是私营工商业者必须养成守法习惯，而国家机关工作人员也必须在守法精神方面起模范作用。
    各位代表，我们这个宪法草案就要通过成为正式的宪法了，愿我们大家在中国共产党和毛主席领导之下，为它的贯彻实施而共同来奋斗，中华人民共和国的前途是光明的，我们的努力是没有任何力量能够阻挠的！
    陈嘉庚代表的发言主席、诸位代表：
    昨天听到了刘少奇代表关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告，我完全同意并衷心热烈的拥护。
    中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的召开，和中华人民共和国宪法的制定，都是我国富有历史意义的大喜事，值得国内外全体同胞欢欣鼓舞。长期以来，华侨就期望祖国能够实行民主宪政，今日在毛主席的英明领导下已可实现了。
    这个宪法草案，是毛主席为人民服务数十年来的经验，历多月而写成的；并于本年三月起至六月中旬止，历三个月，由中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会以及各大行政区，各省市领导机关，各民主党派、人民团体等八千余人参加讨论修改，成了优美完善、符合国情的伟大宪章。但是毛主席为了要更广泛征求全国人民对宪法草案的修改意见，由六月十五日起，颁布全国人民进行讨论、尽量提出修改意见，迄今复历三个月，远如海外华侨亦有充分时间可以参加讨论和提出自己的意见。但在那里因为环境和祖国不一样，不能像我们国内这样组织开会讨论，就是想写信回来也有困难。因此远在海外的华侨不能提出更多的意见，至于选举代表，也是有困难的。在有些帝国主义国家，他们借国际法的干涉，不能允许我们在那里进行选举代表，要选举代表就要坐船到公海去，我们华侨这样多，要坐船到公海去选举是困难的，做不到的。即使我们要这样做，他们也是要干涉的，甚至可能就不给我们再回去。尤其是在今天我们祖国一天一天进步和强盛起来，因而帝国主义也就越妒忌和敌视我们。
    我海外华侨素来对于国家需要宪法，知者固多，而未知者恐或不少。然国家之必需有宪法，譬如商业股份有限公司必需有章程。公司章程由各股东制订，给经理职员遵守施行。若私家商业缺乏有此举，大家自由行动，常会招致许多错误。
    我国前朝专制时代，无有宪法规律，贪污腐化，致外侮内乱，国弱民贫。满清末及国民党蒋介石政府有数次所谓宪法，写了若干民主条文、公民权利，但都是虚伪骗人的，结果都为全国人民所唾弃。
    这次毛主席亲自主持草拟的这个宪法草案，是参考各民主国家的宪法，采取我国历史特点和现代的实际情况，是真正民主的人民宪法。虽经全国人民讨论提出修改意见，好的都尽量采纳了，但大体上与基本精神还是无何差别的。可见全国人民的衷心拥护，这也说明了人人都知道，只有这样才有光明的前途，也才能得到应有的真正的权利，甚至对于在社会主义改造时期的资产阶级，也依法保障他们的生产资料和其他财产所有权与继承权，另一方面却限制他们消极的破坏作用，逐渐改造使向社会主义社会前进。
    这个宪法公布实行后，不但全国人民热烈欣庆，海外千余万侨胞亦必欢欣鼓舞也。
    刘民生代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案和刘少奇委员关于宪法草案的报告。
    我认为这个宪法草案充分地反映了中国人民的民主生活和我们国家真正的民主实质。这是中国人民百多年来英勇奋斗的结果。中国革命的基本任务之一，就是实现人民民主。中国共产党代表着中国人民革命的意志，制定了人民民主革命的纲领，依照人民代表大会制的原则，根据各个革命阶段的具体条件和实际情况，建立了革命的国家机关，和人民民主制度，从而团结了全国人民战胜了敌人。自中华人民共和国成立，颁布了共同纲领，实行人民民主专政，更取得了社会改革和经济恢复等一系列的新胜利。在共同纲领的基础上，在毛主席亲自领导下，又制定了这个宪法草案。我们这个宪法草案，毫无疑问，是今后逐步实现国家社会主义工业化，和逐步完成社会主义改造的重大保证。
    但是我们过去对中央的政策、法令，学习、研究很不够，领会很不足，这就不能正确的全面的贯彻实现。因此山东省的各级人民政府在工作上曾出现了不少缺点和错误。首先表现在，对于人民民主制度的贯彻不够有力。使省及某些县的各界人民代表会议未能按期召开；其次不能充分倾听人民群众的意见，及时解决群众疾苦。至于作风上的不够民主，有时强迫命令、简单化和拖拉分散的现象，也是很严重的。这就大大地影响了政府与人民群众的关系，损害了群众的积极性。现在宪法即将通过颁行，今后我们一定要忠实地遵守宪法，依靠人民群众，接受群众的监督，效忠人民民主制度，努力为人民服务。我相信，在中国共产党和毛主席、中央人民政府的领导下，一定能够克服过去的缺点和错误，进一步团结全省人民为完成国家所给予的各项光荣任务而奋斗。
    杨石先代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我以无限欢欣和万分感谢的心情代表天津市的人民和天津市代表组完全赞同和热烈拥护中央人民政府委员会第三十四次会议所修正通过的中华人民共和国宪法草案，并同意刘少奇委员关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告。这个宪法草案是无数革命先烈流血牺牲所换来的。它用法律的形式固定了我们革命胜利的成果。它代表了中国六亿人民的意志来巩固自己的人民民主政权和通过和平的道路过渡到社会主义社会。它是社会主义类型而同时又符合过渡时期的特点的。这一宪法的诞生，无疑地将给我们全国人民以强烈的鼓舞，推动大家更加紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，自觉地贡献出自己的力量，为实现过渡时期的总任务而奋斗。
    在此次的深入学习和积极讨论当中，我深刻地感觉到过去自己在不少方面，体会国家政策法令的精神还是不够的，因而有时在工作上造成了一定的损失。例如宪法草案第九十五条明白规定“国家对于从事科学、教育、文学、艺术和其他文化事业的公民的创造性工作，给以鼓励和帮助。”大学是国家最高的学府，是人民科学和文化水平的重要标志，必须积极开展有计划有领导的研究工作，才能在学术上有大量创造性的贡献，肯定的这是大学一项重要的任务。应当在不影响教学改革和不影响教学工作的条件下积极进行研究工作，而决不可以将其放松，成为自流的现象，如上年度在南开大学所发生的情形那样。这是我应该提出深刻自我批评的。
    在全面学习苏联的高等教育当中，我们体会到教学和研究是一个事情的两个方面，必须统一起来而不能互相对立的。教师如果只从事教学而不进行研究，久而久之必然要成为教条主义者。进行研究，发现新的知识和新的事物规律，同时也就丰富了教学。这不但解决了教学结合实际的问题，而且解决了提高教学质量的问题。因为研究的题目不是学术上亟待澄清的，即是生产建设当中所需要解答的。目前各种学校发展太快，成熟的教师数量太少，所以我们应该坦率地承认今天各高等学校的教学质量是相当低的，不能达到国家要求建设社会主义人才的标准的。提高的关键：一方面在发挥潜力，使有能力有训练的教师起更大的作用，另一方面要大力培养优秀的青年助教和有计划有领导的开展研究工作。在发挥潜力方面，由于加强了新老教师的团结，已经取得一定的成绩。大力培养青年助教也正在贯彻之中。不过这里我们遇到的困难是分配来的毕业生质量不好的问题。有的业务水平太差，甚至有的几门主要课程都不及格；有的觉悟不高，甚至品质恶劣。教师是同学的表率，无论在学问上，道德品质上，政治觉悟上，能够成为同学的榜样的，才能领导同学。所以大学教师绝不是任何大学毕业生都可以充当的。领导上必须改正对大学师资不够正确的看法，即同经济建设部门的需要比起来，认为是次要的，也必须改正平均主义的作风，以为有了一个好的，可以搭配两个坏的。如果不肯下决心分配可以培养作师资的毕业生到大学，今后将无法完成他的任务，培养不出合乎规格的人才来。苏联在他建国过程中，最初也是坚决将最优秀的毕业生留充师资的。在开展研究工作方面我们如果只了解它的重要性并开始去作，也还不够。必须有计划有领导的去开展。条件不足，全面开花，固然不可。随便作点，不全力以赴，不向不同能力的教师提出不同的研究要求，也是错误的。我现在认识到我造成错误的根源，是在于保守的态度和自满的情绪。以为南开过去作过研究，现在也还有人在作研究，既然事实不允许，不能全面展开，就不如等一年后，课程改革告一段落再大张旗鼓地来进行吧。这一错误思想如无苏联专家及时的指出，使我们得到纠正，南开大学提高教学质量的工作，就必然会受到影响。这是我今后应加警惕的。也是可以提出供其它大学参考的。
    叶贻东代表的发言主席、各位代表，各位来宾：
    我以印度尼西亚华侨代表的身份，热烈拥护刘少奇委员关于宪法问题的报告。我国宪法序言中指出：“我国根据平等、互利、互相尊重领土主权的原则同任何国家建立和发展外交关系的政策已经获得成就，今后将继续贯彻。在国际事务中，我国坚定不移的方针是为世界和平和人类进步的崇高目的而努力”。这一关于领导我国在国际关系上的努力方向和政策，对长期居留在国外的华侨，特别具有重大的意义。我们国外华侨正是遵循这种精神，和当地人民友好相处。我们在国外本着侨民的身份，不参加当地政治纷争，不介入当地内政，同时我们更希望我们侨居国的政府能与祖国建立友好关系。
    我们中国人民和印度尼西亚人民都是同样爱好和平的，长期来两国人民有着传统的友谊。自从中华人民共和国成立以后，这种友好关系有着更进一步的发展。我们侨居印度尼西亚的华侨，一向就是和当地人民友好相处，并愿意增进这种友好关系，促进印度尼西亚和祖国的亲睦邦交。今年六月，我国周总理在访问印度、缅甸时，与印度总理、缅甸总理分别发表的联合声明中所提出的互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的五项原则，已受到亚洲及世界许多国家的普遍欢迎。这五项原则更具体的体现了我国外交政策的和平精神，表现了我国人民爱好和平的真诚愿望。我们侨居在印度尼西亚的华侨同样是热烈地拥护这五项和平外交原则，渴望印度尼西亚共和国和我国的邦交进一步的发展和巩固。
    但是，美帝国主义好战分子却唆使流窜到印度尼西亚的蒋介石爪牙，千方百计的企图破坏祖国和印度尼西亚两国的邦交，破坏祖国和印度尼西亚的和平贸易，挑拨华侨和印度尼西亚人民的友好关系，为了祖国人民与印度尼西亚人民的共同利益，我们要坚决反对这种挑拨阴谋。
    解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团是我国人民神圣的历史任务，国外华侨坚决拥护和支持祖国人民解放台湾的斗争。只有解放台湾才能进一步巩固祖国的安全和保障亚洲及世界的和平。印度尼西亚人民和世界爱好和平的人民对祖国人民解放台湾的正义斗争寄予同情是可以理解的，这正如我们中国人民同情印度尼西亚人民要求收回西伊里安的斗争是一样的。
    代表们，我们祖国经济建设的辉煌成就和我国和平外交政策在国际斗争中所取得的巨大胜利，已经使我们祖国的国际威望空前的提高，这一点对我们身处在国外的华侨来说更是感到特别的兴奋。今后，我们国外华侨将更不分帮派、不分阶层、互助合作，搞好我们华侨本身的福利事业，对少数误入歧途为蒋贼所欺骗与利用的人们，欢迎他们弃暗投明。我们要努力使侨胞们都共同紧密的团结在毛主席和祖国的周围，并努力增进我们华侨与侨居国人民的友谊与团结。
    荣毅仁代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    自从中华人民共和国宪法草案公布以来，上海的私营工商业者，进行了广泛的学习和讨论，一致怀着欢欣鼓舞的热忱，以积极接受改造的行动，来拥护和迎接中华人民共和国宪法的诞生。
    宪法即将通过，全国人民必须共同遵守，以保证共同愿望的实现。我们私营工商业者当然应该切实遵守。但是，由于私营工商业者具有资本主义的唯利是图的本质，虽然在解放后有了些进步，对国计民生起了一定的有利的积极作用，但无庸讳言，我们还存在着或多或少的对国计民生不利的消极作用。就上海来说，到目前为止，大部分的私营工商企业，已走上了各种不同形式的国家资本主义经济，大、中型的工厂申请公私合营的有一千一百多户，而且还在不断的增多。但是仍有不少的工商业者，在思想上存在着若干顾虑、彷徨、消极、急躁的情绪。在具体行动上，工业方面还不能做到完全按质、按量、按时来完成国家任务。如我所经营的企业也时有延期交货、次货率超过标准、浪费很大这类不应有的事情发生。也有少数工厂，甚至有严重的偷工减料现象。在商业方面，不服从市场管理的情况以及各种不老实的经营作风也还没有做到应有的改变。在纳税方面，偷漏面还是相当的广；少数企业户还有抽逃资金或者坐吃等待的消极行为。更严重的有个别企业主发生殴打干部、破坏生产的抗拒改造的行为。因此，私营工商业者如何以更切实的行动来遵守宪法、接受改造，是一个严重的实际问题。
    我们私营工商业者一定要真诚地接受中国共产党和工人阶级的领导，自觉地接受改造，不断地进行自我批评，坚决地与“自私自利”思想作斗争，使个人利益服从整体利益。在具体行动上，最基本的就是：切实做到爱国守法，接受国家行政机关的管理、国营经济的领导和工人群众的监督，并争取走上国家资本主义经济的高级形式。我们必须不断学习，逐渐培养社会主义思想和劳动观点。在工商业者之间，彼此要相互帮助、督促、批评，以求得共同进步。同时，由于我们存在着资本主义的思想作风，特别是上海工商业者，过去受帝国主义腐朽思想的毒害最深，我们竭诚要求各方面的人士，经常不断地给我们以严肃的、率直的、兄弟般的批评、教育和帮助，帮助我们改造和进步。
    工商联和同业公会是包括各类工商业者联合组成的人民团体，应该恰当地运用这个组织力量，来推动私营企业和工商业者的改造。我们希望工商行政管理部门能够加强领导和帮助它们健全组织。同时，国营企业的代表，特别是参加同业公会的国营代表，必须经常参加它们的各项工作，具体加以领导，这将会更有利于国家的建设和对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造事业。因此，我们反对有少数国营代表把工商联和同业公会看成单纯是资产阶级的组织，羞与为伍和放弃领导的错误观点。
    各位代表，我们在中国共产党和毛主席领导之下，有这样一个为全国人民一致拥护的宪法作为我们行动的准则，我们人民内部的团结一定更加紧密，我们崇高的共同愿望一定能够顺利实现。
    张大煜代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我谨以人民代表和科学工作者的身份，热烈地拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案，并热烈拥护刘少奇委员关于宪法草案的报告。
    从宪法草案第九十五条就可以明确地看出我们的国家对于科学、文化及从事科学、文化事业的公民是极其重视和关怀的。今后我要更加积极地从事科学研究工作，以实际行动来拥护宪法。从抗日战争爆发后，我曾从纯粹科学的研究转向煤炭石油方面的技术科学研究。当时幻想可以得到反动政府的支持，能在科学技术上，贡献自己的力量，同祖国人民一起打退日本帝国主义的侵略。当时我曾建议并尝试过从植物油制造重要国防物资的研究，也开始研究过将煤炼制成汽油的方法。但是我从北平跑到长沙，从长沙辗转到昆明，从高等学校改业到研究机构，都在设备、人力、经费上遇到了重重困难。虽然经过千辛万苦建立起来一个小型煤炼油的试验工厂，但也终于停顿了。科学，在反动统治阶级看来不过是点缀品而已。我们当时所进行的，与抗日战争有密切关系的科学研究在蒋介石卖国集团的反动统治下没有得到任何支持，就这样被摧残被扼杀了。
    一九四九年我到大连参加科学研究工作，当时的困难是很多的，由于中国共产党和人民政府极其重视科学，源源不断地供应设备、人力和经费，从各方面给予支援与鼓励，在全体工作人员的努力下，我们的工作得到顺利的进展，并已获得新的科学成就。这项新的科学成就，在政府的重视和支持下，不久就将在我们祖国社会主义工业化的过程中应用。
    各位代表先生：这就是我个人从事科学工作短短的经历，解放前与解放后鲜明的对比。
    五年来，我们工作的成就还是很小的，比较重大的科学技术问题的研究工作有的只是刚刚开始，有的尚未开始。我们将以谦逊、勤恳的态度，加强学习，努力工作，来回答祖国和人民对我们的关怀与鼓励。
    在我们向着社会主义社会过渡和这一伟大历史时期，国家建设对我们的要求是愈来愈多了。中国科学原来基础薄弱，水平不高，科学队伍还很小，而国家有关部门对科学技术研究工作的统一筹划和密切配合，尚注意得不够，使科学力量分散，因而，有的工作互相重复，另外有些非常重要的工作尚未能开始。我们科学工作者仍存在着脱离实际，好高骛远的倾向，对生产部门提出的研究课题，往往强调工作条件不够，或与个人兴趣不合，不乐于接受。特别是在我们科学研究部门对政治思想领导和科学研究的组织工作都做得不够，给工作招致许多损失。然而这些前进中的困难，和工作中的缺点是一定会得到克服的。我们要在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的英明领导下，更加紧密地团结一致，密切联系实际，诚恳地学习苏联先进科学和技术，积极地培养新生力量，更好地为国家建设服务，为遵循宪法所规定的道路，为实现光辉灿烂的社会主义社会而奋斗！
    陈荫南代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案和刘少奇委员关于宪法草案的报告。
    我们的宪法，为中国人民已经取得的伟大成就，建筑了一个坚固的堡垒，为建设社会主义国家建筑了一条康庄的轨道。这个堡垒和轨道是中国人民长期艰苦奋斗的结晶，是全国人民高度智慧的集中表现，全国人民将从此发挥无穷无尽的力量。
    如果说，青年人拥护这部宪法，是因为中国共产党为青年人开辟了无限美好的前途；那么，我们这些上了年岁的人拥护这部宪法，就不单是因为享受到今天的幸福生活，而且是因为受了昨天的艰辛和痛苦。我觉得，在全国人民迫切地期待通过这部宪法的时候，回忆一下过去几十年的往事是有好处的。就拿我自己的经验来说吧，我痛恨过满清政府的专制和卖国，参加过辛亥革命的斗争。后来满清政府是被推翻了，但是我们的选举权仍然是被剥夺的。大家一定还记得，民国初年，规定选举权的条件是：必须要有五万元以上的恒产，举人以上的功名和每年直接缴纳两块大洋以上的田赋。经过这些条件的限制，选举权只好落在少数有钱人的身上了，这还算什么民主呢？所以推翻了一个专制的满清政府之后，换来的仍是一个不民主的“民国”政府。这是任何一个具有起码的民主思想的人所不能容忍的。后来人民公敌蒋介石登了台，不仅没有好转，却连这一点点“民主”也被抹掉了。蒋介石独裁卖国，镇压人民，迫害民主人士，完全把自己变成了屠夫。他的黑暗统治超过了以往的任何一个政府，甚至比之历代封建王朝有过之而无不及。不过他并不能吓倒人民，人民也从来没有失去信心。中国人民终于在中国共产党的领导下，经过了长期的艰苦奋斗，英勇牺牲，换来了震撼世界的伟大胜利。毫无疑问，我们这部宪法，是烈士们用鲜血换来的，是用人民的力量争取得来的。我想，不管是老年人，成年人，青年人，如果他们愈能知道这部宪法的来之不易，就愈能懂得如何的珍贵它，遵守它，并且用自己的整个生命去保卫它。
    现在，在我们的国家里，如果就国家制度来说，就整个领导来说，我们可以毫无愧色地说我们完全是民主的了。但并不是说我们每个组织，每个工作干部的作风，所有的部门，都具有这种民主精神。我们还有一些基层干部存在强迫命令的作风，他们对完成任务的责任心是好的，但忘记了对上负责和对群众负责的一致性。当然，这种情况的产生，不应过多地责备基层干部，因为下面的强迫命令往往来自上面的官僚主义，甚至来自中央一些部门的官僚主义。比如前一时期要“人畜分居”，要“创造无蚊区”，他们的出发点是好的，可是在现有的农村条件下，这种希望是脱离实际的，是主观的。这样的任务要基层干部去办，怎能不发生命令主义呢。又如有些地区在组织互助合作时，一下说冒进了，一下又说自流，莫衷一是，因此，不仅群众有意见，就是下面干部也是有意见的。可见基层干部思想作风上的毛病，往往不单是他们本身的缺点，如果领导干部都能从实际出发，了解下情，领导得及时，交代得具体，给下级干部树立一个良好的榜样，许多毛病是可以避免或者减少的。
    我认为宪法的颁布，将进一步提高全国人民，特别是国家机关工作人员爱国主义和社会主义的觉悟，可以改正我们所存在的某些官僚主义和命令主义，将有力地推动生产建设和各项工作，并且会自觉地履行公民的义务，遵守宪法和法律。我们这部宪法的通过，再一次表明了世界上没有任何力量能够阻挡住伟大的中国人民向社会主义社会前进。
    韩望尘代表的发言主席团、各位代表：
    我们工商界热烈拥护经过全国人民充分讨论和反复修正后的宪法草案，并同意刘少奇委员关于宪法草案的报告。我们认为宪法草案中规定的“国家依照法律保护资本家的生产资料所有权和其他资本所有权。国家对资本主义工商业采取利用、限制和改造的政策。国家通过国家行政机关的管理、国营经济的领导和工人群众的监督，利用资本主义工商业的有利于国计民生的积极作用，限制它们的不利于国计民生的消极作用，鼓励和指导它们转变为各种不同形式的国家资本主义经济，逐步以全民所有制代替资本家所有制。国家禁止资本家的危害公共利益、扰乱社会经济秩序、破坏国家经济计划的一切非法行为”是完全正确的。这给我们所有的私营工商业者，都指出了努力的方向和光明远大的前途。
    我们陕西省、西安市的私营工商业者，经过宪法草案的讨论，不仅深刻地体会到我国宪法的民主性，而且从解放以来的许多事实中，逐步认识到国家资本主义经济的优越性和接受社会主义改造的必要性。很多人都以增加生产，改善经营，提早交纳税款，争取社会主义改造的实际行动，来表示对宪法草案的拥护。也有一部分人在讨论中检讨了自己过去对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造认识不够而发生过消极经营、抽逃资金、偷漏税款等错误的思想行为。今后，我们陕西省、西安市的全体工商业者，誓将继续端正认识，改进经营，遵守宪法，努力把企业纳入国家资本主义轨道，积极创造条件，接受社会主义改造，完成国家建设任务，紧紧团结在中国共产党、中央人民政府的周围，同全国人民一道，为实施宪法、完成建设社会主义的总任务而贡献出我们的力量。
    陈明仁代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的首要任务是制定我国的宪法，这是一件具有重大历史意义的事情。我参加过对“中华人民共和国宪法草案”的讨论，在这次会议上又听到了宪法起草委员会刘少奇委员所作的“关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告”。对上述宪法草案和报告，我表示完全同意和热烈拥护，并赞成大会予以通过，正式颁布成为中华人民共和国的第一个宪法。
      我们的宪法用立法形式巩固了人民革命的成果和中华人民共和国建立以来政治上、经济上的新胜利，同时又用立法形式将国家在过渡时期的总任务肯定下来，指出社会主义的前进方向，使全国人民有所努力。因此，巩固和发展这些成果与胜利，就是宪法给我们的神圣任务。这个任务是全国人民的任务，更是中国人民解放军光荣的任务。
      要贯彻宪法，要维护宪法，从军队来说，头一件事就是加强守法观念的教育，克服居功自傲的思想，使军队人员成为遵守宪法的模范。五年来，人民解放军在保卫祖国安全和协助国家进行经济建设方面作了很大贡献，在军民、军政关系上基本上也是很融洽的。但仍然有一些缺点。我们有些人自以为“高人一等”，可以不遵守国家的法律，甚至任意违法乱纪，如随意占住民房，军车不遵守交通规则，经常发生车祸，同政府打交道时态度欠和蔼等。这些思想和行为如果不予纠正，就会影响军民、军政的团结，就会影响宪法的贯彻实施。
     在中华人民共和国地方各级人民代表大会和地方各级人民委员会组织法中，规定了地方各级国家行政机关的优抚工作任务。应该说，这几年的优抚工作是有巨大成绩的，但在保护革命军人婚姻、帮助烈军属克服生产上和生活上的困难、妥善安顿复员转业建设军人等方面，也还存在一些应该解决、可以解决但是没有得到解决的问题。起义部队的人员，绝大多数都光荣而愉快地走上了新的工作、学习和生产岗位；但也还有极少数的人，没有得到尽可能恰当的安置。我希望上述这些问题今后会引起 地方各级国家行政机关的高度注意。
    最近我国各民主党派、各人民团体发表了为解放台湾的联合宣言。我认为，这个宣言同宪法草案第二十条的规定是完全相合的，这是一篇义正词严的讨伐蒋介石卖国集团的革命檄文。我们人民解放军拥护这个宣言，认为解放台湾是我国人民义无反顾的庄严斗争。这个斗争需要各方面工作的配合，但主要的、最终的任务，还是军事任务。因此，我们军队必需加强政治、军事训练，加速军队的正规化和现代化建设，时刻保持战斗准备，只要上级命令一下，我们军队就保证立刻投入战斗，胜利地解放台湾，把五星红旗插遍台湾全岛。
    联合宣言指出，除蒋贼一人而外，任何跟随蒋贼逃到台湾的人都容许弃暗投明，受到立功赎罪、既往不究的宽大待遇。现在，那些逃到台湾的人，虽然看到了蒋介石卖国集团定将消灭，台湾定将解放，因而愿意向人民悔罪，但心存疑惧的人也还是会有的。因此，我愿对这些人指出，中国共产党说话从来是算数的，宽大政策是实在的，兑现的。我过去的罪恶并不比现在某些在台湾的人轻，由于我能够悬崖勒马，向人民悔罪，中国共产党就给我以宽大待遇。不但如此，几年来，中国共产党还教育我、鼓励我、帮助我，给我为人民服务的机会，使我成为人民解放军的高级干部，现在又被选为全国人民代表大会代表。我过去盲人瞎马，替蒋介石卖命，做蒋贼的帮凶，终不免为蒋贼所排挤打击；而今天在中国共产党领导下，我却能竭己之力来为人民做事，在集体事业中分享愉快和幸福。中国共产党的宽大政策挽救了我，使我在污泥坑中得以拔出腿来，重新作人，这是铁的事实。在台湾的人，应该看到我这个、以及其它许多类似的事实，猛醒悔悟，及早回头。
    台湾一定要解放，台湾也一定能解放。正义在我们这一边，胜利也就必然在我们这一边。
    嵇文甫代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意宪法草案和刘少奇委员关于宪法草案的报告。现在谨就自己对于宪法草案的一点体会说几句话。
    如所周知，我们的宪法草案是经过宪法起草委员会长时间详细研讨、制订出来，又经过全国广大人民长时间反复讨论，从上而下，又从下而上，吸收各方面意见，修订好多次，最后又交全国人民代表大会再加讨论的。根据精神原则，对一个字，一个标点符号，都经过多少人反复推敲过多少遍。这个宪法草案的制定过程，如此严肃认真，实事求是，充分发挥民主精神，恐怕在全世界制宪史上也很少见。单是这一点，也就很值得我们引以自豪。
    的确，这个宪法草案是中国人民革命的胜利纪录和经验总结，同时也是照耀着我们前进道路的灯塔。它好像一座历史发展的里程碑，既标明了我们已经走过多么远，也指示出我们还要往那里走去。它好像现代中国的一面镜子，从这里面反映出中国社会的深刻变化，反映出中国社会的新面貌。看，这里面，多少年来压在我们头上的封建土地所有制，官僚资本，帝国主义势力，都被人民革命的伟大力量扫除掉了。看，这里面庄严地建立起一个工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主政权，明晃晃地开出一条走向社会主义社会的康庄大道。许多进步人类的理想，大家多年来的宿愿，都呈现在这里面。回想几十年前，连一部极不成样子的钦定宪法都要不到手，现在我们却有了真正人民自己的宪法了。那时候我们耳朵里所不断听到的是“瓜分”，“瓜分”，现在我国却站在保卫世界和平的最前列，以世界大国之一的身份出现在国际舞台上，是任何阴谋暴力所不能抹杀的了。说到这里，我们真不能不深深感谢中国共产党和毛主席，感谢为着祖国人民革命事业而艰苦奋斗流血牺牲的无数先烈。因为要不是他们，我们就到不了今天这地步，就不会有这个宪法。
    自然，我们的宪法还只是过渡时期的宪法。我们还没有建设成社会主义社会，而只是正在向那里过渡。我们的宪法，每一条规定，都是根据我们过渡时期的历史特点，根据我们自己的具体条件，从我们广大人民的现实要求中产生出来的。当然，我们并不停留在现状上，我们奋斗的目标，我们向前发展的道路，在我们的宪法里面已经明白指示出来了。
    重要的问题在于实践。方向明确了，任务规定了。每一个公民，应尽什么义务，应享什么权利，每一个干部，每一个机关，应该做什么，都明白载到宪法里了。从今以后，我们必须照宪法办事，我们的思想品质也必须够得上宪法所要求的水准。我热忱地由衷地拥护这个宪法，并愿站在自己工作岗位上，为贯彻实行这个宪法而奋斗。我们得到这个宪法好不容易！我们为着这个宪法，艰苦奋斗数十年，而终于得到胜利。我们今后还得继续艰苦奋斗，通过一系列尖锐而复杂的斗争来贯彻实行这个宪法，并以此为基础向前迈进，争取更大的胜利！敬祝各位代表身体健康！
    欧百川代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    中华人民共和国宪法草案公布后，经过我们多次的学习和讨论，尤其在这次大会上听了刘少奇委员关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告，我们感到无限兴奋，表示衷心拥护。
    我们贵州苗族、布依族、侗族、彝族、水家等少数民族，在历代封建王朝以及蒋介石匪帮血腥统治时期，备受压迫剥削，以致惨遭屠杀的痛苦。在清朝咸丰同治年间，苗岭山上的苗族人民被杀得尸骨遍地，清水江中都被鲜血染红了。
    一九四三年蒋匪在清水江流域惨杀苗民几千人，把怀孕的妇女用刺刀戳开，烧了房屋二千多栋。一九四七年蒋匪更进行了残暴的同化政策，不准各少数民族讲自己民族的话，强迫妇女剪头发，所穿的裙子都被烧掉。在那些苦难的日子里，少数民族人民过着盖“秧被”、吃“厥芭”，甚至十七、八岁的大姑娘没有裤子穿的贫困悲惨的生活。一九四九年冬，中国共产党和毛主席解放了我们。由于正确地执行了民族政策，加强了民族团结，到现在已建立了六个自治县，培养了大批民族干部，还帮助少数民族发展了农业生产、文教卫生等事业，并尊重民族风俗习惯，使民族关系及物质、文化生活有了根本改变。这就把民族被压迫被奴役的历史，变成为民族平等的时代，使各民族成为亲密团结的大家庭。我们体会到只有在共产党和毛主席的领导下，少数民族才能得到平等自由。
    四年多来，我们的民族工作是有了很大的成绩。在一系列的工作过程中，我们创造了一些有利条件，但对调查研究工作是作的不够的。清水江流域苗族聚居区，南盘江流域布依族聚居区，有建立相当于专区一级自治区的条件，但尚未建立；从江、黎平等边沿县农业税未得合理调整；自治县的财政划分没有实行；关于民族婚姻纠纷问题，未解决得很好，因而使群众不够满意。
    宪法草案充分反映了各族人民在国家过渡时期的根本要求和共同愿望，并规定中华人民共和国是统一的多民族的国家，各民族一律平等，各民族都有使用和发展自己的语言文字的自由，各少数民族聚居的地方实行区域自治。这就保证少数民族将随着国家建设事业的发展，在政治、经济、文化上从落后的民族逐步提高到先进民族的行列。所以我们贵州少数民族人民在讨论宪法草案时，有一位一百二十岁的苗族人杨国安，在听到关于宪草的传达后，激动地流下热泪说：毛主席是苗家的父亲，什么事都关心我们。宪法的民族精神，使我们全省少数民族人民都深深地受到感动。
    今后的民族工作，我们将依照宪法的规定，继续贯彻推行区域自治，大力发展农业生产，消灭赶山吃饭、广种薄收的落后的生产方法，以达到富裕的生活。我们要培养民族干部，加强民族团结，紧密地团结在共产党、毛主席的周围，为建设各民族人民的伟大祖国而共同努力。
    最后，我要求大会通过我们的宪法草案。
    邓兆祥代表的发言主席、各位代表、各位同志：
    自从中央人民政府公布中华人民共和国宪法草案以来，全国各民族、各阶层男女老少经过热烈讨论，发扬了当家作主的精神，积极提出意见，复由全国人民代表大会代表，聚集首都，作进一步讨论，才成定稿。这个由人民自己亲手制定的宪法，已把我们革命斗争得来的胜利果实肯定下来，确定了我们为着获得日益幸福生活所应走的社会主义道路，它表现着我国六万万人民的整体利益和坚定不移的意志，全国人民都以能够生活在毛泽东时代而感到骄傲。
    我正如大家一样地欢欣鼓舞，对于中华人民共和国宪法草案和刘少奇同志所作的关于宪法草案的报告，完全同意，衷心拥护，并建议大会一致通过。
    同志们：我们不要忘记，这个胜利果实是全国人民在中国共产党领导下艰苦奋斗争取得来的，是无数革命先烈流血牺牲换取得来的。我们追求实现的崇高愿望，就是为着要建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会和人类的和平进步，这都决不容许任何人侵犯和阻挡。但美国帝国主义还在扶植蒋介石卖国匪帮，窃据台湾，妄图复辟，并且组织军事包围，进行侵略，我们为着保护自己将来不断提高的幸福生活，全国人民应更加紧密团结在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的周围以实际行动贯彻自己制定的宪法，保卫祖国，解放台湾，为着人民解放事业的彻底胜利而斗争。
    我们中国人民解放军海军在中国共产党、毛主席和朱总司令的组织和领导下，已同全国人民结成血肉相连的关系，我们在全国人民关怀支持下，一定遵照毛主席的指示建设起一支强大的海军，保卫海防，反对帝国主义侵略。最近，我国各民主党派各人民团体为解放台湾联合宣言，代表全国人民的意志，表明中国人民一定要解放台湾，这立刻得到了全国人民的响应和全力支持。我深切地感到荣幸，自己是人民解放军海军的一员，决心同大家一起，发扬解放军的光荣传统，除继续努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东著作，不断提高觉悟外，当更积极加强军事锻炼，时刻警惕，随时准备接受命令，为解放祖国的台湾贡献自己一切力量。
    解放台湾的联合宣言，已给那些依附蒋贼的人们指出一条生路，他们应该认清前途，弃暗投明，在解放台湾的斗争中立功赎罪，回到祖国的怀抱，在宪法的光辉照耀下，作一个良好的公民。
    同志们！这个宪法是为着我全中国人民的利益而制定的，它总结了我们革命斗争的胜利，指出了我们走入繁荣幸福的社会主义社会的方向，我们一定要同心同德，继续努力去完成实施宪法的伟大任务。于开泉代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    当我们将要庄严地通过宪法的时候，我们衷心地感谢中国共产党和毛泽东主席的正确领导，我们要坚决地遵守宪法，照着宪法办事，用最大的努力，拥护宪法的实施。
    我是一个水力发电建设的工程师，经历过伪满洲国和国民党的反动统治，深刻感到水电事业在那些黑暗时期不能够得到发展，也不是为人民服务的。就以东北丰满水电站的建设来说，日寇为了掠夺我国的资源，强占和低价收买农民的土地，强征我国同胞，在极其恶劣的施工条件下为他们工作。在那种强迫劳动下，建成的混凝土堤坝，质量是低劣的。
    国民党“接收”时，不但没有修堤，反而听信美帝国主义的工程师卡登的建议，把堤坝炸低了一段，使水电站遭到了破坏。
    我在这个水电站建设中，就这样消耗了十几年的时间，但整个工程拖拖拉拉，直到解放前还没有完成。
    解放后由于共产党、毛主席和中央人民政府的正确领导，苏联专家的无私帮助，以及全体职工的努力下，才把这个水电站很快恢复，并进行了科学的改建和扩建工作，使它有效地为国民经济服务。这些都充分说明了我们人民民主制度的优越性，同时，苏联技术的先进性，也在这里再一次地得到了证明。所以我们必须热爱我们的国家制度，在社会主义社会建设中，认真地学习苏联。
    在资本主义国家里，由于私有制度的障碍，好多建设事业，如果同资本家们的利益冲突，便不能进行，尤其像水电建设事业，要求河流的综合开发，涉及防洪、水土保持、发电、灌溉、航道、筏运、渔业及河川土地的权益使用等问题，在资本主义国家那种各自为政和唯利是图的情况下，河流根本不可能得到合理的利用。这些问题，在我们的宪法中，已完全得到解决。
    根据苏联的建设经验，要建设社会主义社会，必须大量地综合地开发水力资源，以便逐步使全国电气化，而且也只有在社会主义类型的国家里，才可能进行像苏联的古比雪夫、斯大林格勒那样巨大的水电站建设。我国的水力资源是丰富的，又有苏联的建设经验可资学习，我们有条件作好水电建设事业，但过去我们对于河川开发的长远观点认识不足，统一的规划也未及时作出，有关部门又缺乏主动和相互的密切配合，如官厅水库，在防洪与发电的问题上，由于看法不统一曾造成过损失。我们对于河川开发，一定要向苏联学习，拟定长远的电力发展计划，作为国民经济发展的基础；设立全国的地形测绘、地质普查、水文观测的各种的统一机构；编制全国水力开发纲要和十年到二十年的水力发电建设计划方案，这样才能使全国河川水利建设在一个统一的国家规划的指导下，有步骤、有分工、有重点地逐步实现。目前我们的国家已在规划黄河全流域的综合开发方案，设计和建设官厅等水电站多处。我们今后可能而且一定能够大量发展水电事业，使全国的水流有效地为国民经济服务。作为水电建设工作者，我衷心感激国家对于科学研究和创造性工作所给的鼓励和帮助。让我们全国水电事业工作者加速前进吧，为国家社会主义工业化的建设事业贡献出一切力量。
    陈毅代表的发言主席和各位代表同志们：
    听了刘少奇同志关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告，我感到非常的兴奋和满意，同时，也深以能有机会参加这个宪法的讨论和制定，而感到很大的光荣。
    这个宪法是中华人民共和国的第一个宪法，也是我国有史以来真正符合人民利益的宪法。这部宪法的起草、讨论、修改和通过，采取了十分民主、十分郑重的态度，采取了领导与群众相结合的方法，广泛地征求了人民的意见，集中了群众的愿望，并且进一步将各种意见加以组织和提炼。这样的制宪，在我国宪法史上是一次根本的革命。拿上海市来作为一个例子，今年七月以来，全市六百二十七万人口中有二百七十万人听到了有关宪法草案的报告，其中有一百五十六万人热烈地参加了宪法草案的讨论，据现有的统计，上海市人民在讨论中对宪法草案一共提出了十六万五千多条修改和补充的意见。这种深入的宣传和群众性的讨论，一方面大大地提高了人民群众的社会主义觉悟，另一方面也在各项实际工作中提高了工作的积极性。上海人民正以增加生产提高工作的实际行动来迎接中华人民共和国宪法的诞生。
    我们的宪法没有一条虚文，没有一句空话，这样的宪法就能够实行和必须实行。我衷心拥护和满意这个宪法，我建议全国人民代表大会通过这个宪法。在宪法通过之后，我们应该以身作则来遵守和实行这个宪法。宪法向我国全体公民提出一个行动准则：遵守宪法是中华人民共和国公民的义务，是作一个公民的起码条件；反之，违反宪法就是破坏国家秩序，破坏公众利益，它就要受法律的制裁，遭受人民的唾弃。遵守宪法，保证宪法的实施，不容许任何违反宪法的行为，这是我国公民对待宪法所必须采取的正确的政治态度。
    五年来，我国在各方面的成就是极其巨大的，这是中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的正确领导的结果，也是全国人民团结一致共同努力的结果。在已有的成就方面我不准备加以叙述，在今后可能获得的更大成就方面我也不准备加以预测，为了宪法的实施，我想对目前我国各级政府工作中所应该纠正的主要的缺点提出一点批评。
    我首先认为，因为我们工作中有了重大成就而忽视我们工作中还存在着严重缺点和错误，这是极其不好的事。由于批评和自我批评不够开展，某些政府工作人员还没有接受人民群众监督的修养和习惯，因此，从中央人民政府到各级地方人民政府的某些部门负责人员和某些主管人员，还不善于倾听人民意见，不尊重人民民主权利，对于人民的生活疾苦，确实还存在着一种漠不关心的官僚主义态度。尤其是某些政府主管人员和部门负责人员不能主动地批评和揭发自己的缺点和错误，还存在着喜奉承、爱颂扬、怕批评或拒绝批评的恶习气，因而不能接近人民群众和取得人民群众的帮助，这样对于纠正错误、改进工作便缺乏适时性与彻底性，便不能不削弱我们同人民群众的联系。我们应抓住实施宪法的时机进一步去增强同人民群众的联系。各级人民代表和各级人民政府工作人员要以身作则地遵守宪法，对违反宪法的行为作无情斗争，同时大张旗鼓地宣传宪法，根据宪法精神，组织和发动人民群众批评与检查政府的工作，而各级政府工作人员更要虚心接受人民群众的批评来改善自己的工作，这样两相结合，便能使人民民主的阳光照遍一切阴暗角落，使我们政府工作中的官僚主义习气不断地得到纠正，使新中国的社会主义建设事业获得更伟大的进步。
    我自己忝为人民代表之一，同时又是上海市人民政府主要负责人员之一，我愿意在上海工作中去纠正我所揭露的缺点和错误，以这样的实践来拥护宪法，来拥护全国人民代表大会，来拥护党中央和毛主席，来拥护中央人民政府。
    王芸生代表的发言
    我现在对中华人民共和国宪法草案发言，感到万分的兴奋和极大的光荣。
    自从今年三月，我就参加关于宪法草案初稿的讨论，半年来已经看到宪法草案换了四个稿，尽量吸收大家的意见，作了精密的修改，现在已经尽美尽善，即将成为中国过渡时期的最符合实际、最理想和最完善的宪法。
    宪法给每个公民的各种基本权利，都有保证；每个公民在自己的工作、生活和思想活动上，都应该好好地使用他的权利。结合我个人的职业工作，我有两点感想：
    一、宪法草案第八十七条规定“中华人民共和国公民有言论、出版……的自由”，我们国家迫切需要开展健全的批评和自我批评；但是，建国五年来的情况，我们的言论工作往往落后于现实，缺乏刚劲有力的批评风气。这种情况，我们做言论工作的首先应该自我批评，是我们没有认真尽职尽责，以致言论工作表现得软弱无力，报纸恹恹无生气。另外一个原因，是在我们内部还残存着官僚主义，官僚主义是缺乏嘉纳善言的风度的。我们国家进步非常大，成就非常多，这是世界公认的；同时不少的人因此有了骄傲自满的情绪，他们非但不鼓励言论批评，甚至抗拒批评。自然，这种情形并不是普遍的，也还不很严重，但必须注意加以纠正。言论工作者今后在宪法的保障之下，应该掌握言论自由的权利，认真尽职尽责，为国家开展健全的批评和自我批评。
    二、宪法草案第九十五条规定“中华人民共和国保障公民进行科学研究、文学艺术创作和其他文化活动的自由。”五年来的情况是，政治大大进步，经济赶不上，文化更赶不上。在文化部门尤其缺少创造性的工作，小说、剧本少得可怜；一般的议论文章，大都是颠过来，倒过去，敷衍滥调；报纸上的新闻写作，摆列着千篇一律的格式，弥漫着一种固定的调子。这种文风，是严重的八股化、公式化和单调化。应当指出，解放以后的文风，用字慎重，说理正确，是好的一面；但是，一般喜欢造作囉囉嗦嗦的长句，堆砌重重复复的引语，写成干干巴巴缺少情感的文章，一味的八股公式，很少人敢作创造性的尝试。首先是我自己，未曾写过生动有力的东西，大公报上也很少好文章。这样的文风，同我们国家的飞跃发展的情况对照，是极不相称的。宪法草案要“国家对于从事科学、教育、文学、艺术和其他文化事业的公民的创造性工作，给以鼓励和帮助。”我们文化工作者就应该不辜负国家的鼓励和帮助，给新中国创造新的文风。
    我热烈拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案，热烈拥护刘少奇委员的报告，我建议大会庄严地通过这部宪法。我们通过这部宪法，是庄严地宣布六万万人走社会主义道路，庄严地宣布六万万人抱定坚定不移的方针为世界和平和人类进步的崇高目的而努力。这是具有历史意义的世界大事。
    作为一个代表，我保证：一定效忠人民民主制度，遵守宪法和法律，努力为人民服务；一定在自己的工作岗位上坚持学习，努力工作，而不掉队。（附图片）
