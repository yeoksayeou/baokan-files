    At the An Dong Welcome Rally for Returning Chinese People's Volunteer Army Troops
    Wang Congwu's Welcome Speech

    Dear comrades of the returning Chinese People's Volunteer Army:
    As you triumphantly return from the Korean front, we, on behalf of The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Chinese People's Committee for Resisting America and Aiding Korea, extend our warmest welcome to you!
    Four years ago, the American aggressors launched a war of aggression against Korea and, at the same time, occupied our territory of Taiwan. In the winter of 1950, the American invading army crossed the 38th parallel on a large scale, extending the flames of war to our northeastern border, seriously threatening our security. At this critical moment, thousands upon thousands of outstanding sons and daughters of our country responded to the call of the motherland, organized the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to resist America and defend our homes and country, and went to Korea to fight alongside the heroic Korean People's Army. After two years and nine months of heroic fighting, they finally defeated the American aggressors and achieved the great victory of the Korean armistice. You are the outstanding sons and daughters of the motherland. In the war to resist America and aid Korea, you overcame all kinds of unimaginable hardships and difficulties and demonstrated unparalleled courage and fortitude. You forged a deep fighting friendship with the Korean people and demonstrated a noble spirit of internationalism. The great victory you achieved together with the Korean people and the Korean People's Army defended Korea's independence, defended the security of the motherland, and defended peace in Asia and the world. You have made a great contribution to the people of the motherland and the peace-loving people of the world, and the people of the whole country will always remember your meritorious deeds.
    Due to the heroic fighting of the Korean and Chinese people's armies, the American aggressors were finally forced to sign the Korean Armistice Agreement. After the victorious realization of the Korean armistice, the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the heroic Korean People's Army faithfully implemented the armistice agreement and vigilantly defended its implementation. In the year or so after the armistice, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army also actively participated in the economic recovery and reconstruction work of the Korean people, and you also demonstrated a noble spirit of internationalism in productive labor. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army is a glorious example for the people of the motherland, and the people of the whole country should learn from you.
    Dear comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, since you bravely went to the front line of resisting America and aiding Korea, the people of the whole country have been concerned about you at all times, and the people of the whole country have actively supported you with practical actions. In every corner of the motherland, whether in the workshops of factories or in the fields of the vast countryside, all the people are unanimously supporting you—our most beloved people—with the achievements of their production or work. Even the innocent and lively children are constantly missing their Volunteer Army uncles. Your heroic fighting has powerfully inspired the patriotic enthusiasm of the people of the whole country, and "Learn from the Volunteer Army" has become a common slogan of the people of the whole country. Your battle victory not only directly defended the socialist construction cause of the motherland, but also inspired the enthusiasm of the people of the motherland to strive for the construction of a socialist society.
    The Chinese people have always loved peace, and we have always advocated a peaceful solution to the Korean issue on a fair and reasonable basis. During the Korean armistice negotiations, although the American aggressors delayed and sabotaged in every possible way, the efforts of the Korean and Chinese people finally made the Korean armistice possible. After the realization of the Korean armistice, the American aggressors and their running dog, the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) bandit gang, conspired to provoke and sabotage, but due to the high vigilance of the Korean and Chinese people, the aggressors' conspiracy failed. During the Geneva Conference, the Soviet, Chinese, and Korean government delegations sought a peaceful solution to the Korean issue with the utmost sincerity, but the U.S. government tried its best to obstruct and prevent it, so that the Korean issue failed to reach an agreement. We must continue to resolutely strive for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. This time, the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army decided to withdraw seven divisions from Korea and return to the motherland, which once again demonstrates our sincerity and confidence in striving for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. In the face of today's powerful world peace forces, the American aggressors' policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war will inevitably run into snags everywhere. If the American aggressive group and its running dog, Li Chengwan, think that the withdrawal of seven divisions of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is an opportunity to be seized and dare to provoke a war, the Chinese and Korean people will, as in the past, give the aggressors a head-on blow!
    Dear comrades, after your victorious return, the people of the motherland will certainly continue to fully support the comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who remain in Korea and fully support our dear neighbor—the heroic Korean people—in their struggle to restore and develop the national economy and strive for the peaceful reunification of their country.
    The people of the whole country are now fighting for the liberation of Taiwan. Taiwan is our country's sacred territory, but the Jiang Jieshi (Chiang Kai-shek) traitorous group, under the protection of American imperialism, has turned Taiwan into a den of traitors. This traitorous group is actively engaged in pirate activities, constantly carrying out harassing and destructive wars against the motherland, and vainly attempting to restore their criminal fascist rule in China. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan and will never stop until they reach their goal.
    Dear comrades, you and all the Volunteer Army comrades have won great honor for the motherland. You have returned victoriously, and the people of the motherland warmly welcome you and thank you! I hope you will study hard and do your best to consolidate the national defense and defend the motherland. We must not relax! We should be ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time!
    Now the first session of the First National People's Congress is being held in our capital—Beijing. This is a meeting of great historical significance. The Constitution of the People's Republic of China, drafted under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao, will be formulated at the first session of the First National People's Congress today. The Constitution summarizes the victorious achievements of our people's long-term struggle and will greatly promote our country's socialist construction cause. Chairman Mao instructed us at the opening of the conference: "Our general task is: to unite the people of the whole country, strive for the support of all international friends, and strive to build a great socialist country, and strive to defend international peace and develop the cause of human progress." He also called on us to "be honest and diligent, encourage each other and help each other, and avoid any exaggeration and pride." The people of the whole country will surely follow Chairman Mao's great call and work together for our lofty ideals!
    We firmly believe that the Volunteer Army comrades who have returned victoriously will continue to struggle, carry forward the glorious tradition, to defend the socialist cause of our great motherland, the Constitution of our great motherland, the great mountains and rivers of our motherland, and the great people of our motherland!
    Welcome the victorious return of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army!
    Salute the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army!
    Continue to strive for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue!
    Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Korean people!
    Long live peace and victory!
    Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people!
    Long live the Communist Party of China!
    Long live the People's Republic of China!

    在安东欢迎中国人民志愿军归国部队大会上
    王从吾的欢迎词亲爱的中国人民志愿军归国部队全体同志们：
    你们从朝鲜前线凯旋归来，我们代表中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会、中国人民抗美援朝总会向你们表示热烈的欢迎！
    四年前，美国侵略者发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，同时侵占了我国领土台湾。一九五零年冬美国侵略军大举越过“三八”线，把战火燃烧到我国东北边境，严重地威胁了我国安全。在这紧急关头，我国千千万万优秀儿女响应了祖国的号召，组织了抗美援朝保家卫国的志愿军，开赴朝鲜，同英雄的朝鲜人民军并肩作战。经过了两年零九个月的英勇战斗，终于打败了美国侵略者，取得了朝鲜停战的伟大胜利。你们是祖国的优秀儿女，在抗美援朝的战争里，你们克服了各种难以想像的艰苦和困难，表现了无比的英勇和坚强；你们同朝鲜人民结成了深厚的战斗友谊，表现了崇高的国际主义精神。你们同朝鲜人民以及朝鲜人民军在一起所取得的伟大胜利，保卫了朝鲜的独立，保卫了祖国的安全，保卫了亚洲和世界和平。你们对祖国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民作了伟大的贡献，全国人民将永远铭记着你们的功勋。
    由于朝、中人民军队的英勇战斗，美国侵略者不得不最后被迫签订了朝鲜停战协定。朝鲜停战胜利实现之后，英勇的中国人民志愿军和英勇的朝鲜人民军信守不渝地执行了停战协定，警觉地保卫着停战协定的实施。在停战之后一年多的时间里，中国人民志愿军又积极参加了朝鲜人民的经济恢复和重建工作，在生产劳动中你们同样地表现了崇高的国际主义精神。中国人民志愿军是祖国人民光荣的榜样，全国人民都要向你们学习。
    亲爱的中国人民志愿军同志们，自从你们英勇地走上抗美援朝前线之后，全国人民时时刻刻都在关怀着你们，全国人民都以实际行动积极地支持着你们。在祖国的每个角落里，无论是在工厂的车间或是在广大农村的田野里，所有的人们都一致以自己的生产或工作的成绩来支持你们——我们最可爱的人。就是天真活泼的儿童们，也无时无刻不在怀念着他们的志愿军叔叔。你们的英勇战斗，有力地鼓舞了全国人民的爱国热情，“向志愿军学习”已经成为全国人民普遍的口号。你们的战斗胜利不但直接保卫了祖国的社会主义建设事业，而且鼓舞了祖国人民为建设社会主义社会而奋斗的热情。
    中国人民从来就是爱好和平的，我们一向主张在公平合理的基础上和平解决朝鲜问题。在朝鲜停战谈判期间，虽然美国侵略者多方拖延和破坏，但由于朝、中两国人民的努力，终使朝鲜停战得以实现。朝鲜停战实现之后，美国侵略者及其走狗李承晚匪帮又阴谋挑衅破坏，但也由于朝、中两国人民的高度警惕，使侵略者的阴谋未能得逞。在日内瓦会议期间，苏联、中国和朝鲜政府代表团以极大的诚意谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决，而美国政府却极力破坏阻挠，使朝鲜问题未能获致协议。我们要继续坚决地为争取和平解决朝鲜问题而奋斗。这次中国人民志愿军总部决定从朝鲜撤出七个师返回祖国，这又一次说明了我们争取朝鲜问题和平解决的诚意和信心。在今天强大的世界和平力量面前，美国侵略者扩军备战的实力政策必然到处碰壁。如果美国侵略集团和它的走狗李承晚以为中国人民志愿军七个师的撤出是可乘之隙，胆敢挑起战端的话，中国人民和朝鲜人民将会像过去一样，给侵略者以迎头痛击！
    亲爱的同志们，你们胜利归来后，祖国人民一定仍将继续全力支持留在朝鲜的中国人民志愿军的同志们，全力支持亲爱的邻邦——英雄的朝鲜人民为恢复、发展国民经济和争取祖国的和平统一而进行的斗争。
    全国人民现在正为解放台湾而斗争。台湾是我国的神圣领土，但是蒋介石卖国集团在美帝国主义的庇护之下，把台湾变成了叛国者的巢穴。这个卖国集团积极从事海盗活动，不断地对祖国进行骚扰性和破坏性的战争，妄想在中国恢复它们的罪恶的法西斯统治。中国人民一定要解放台湾，不达目的，决不休止。
    亲爱的同志们，你们和全体志愿军同志为祖国争得了极大的荣誉，你们胜利归来了，祖国人民热烈地欢迎你们，感谢你们！希望你们努力学习，为巩固祖国国防，保卫祖国，尽最大的力量。我们绝不能松懈！我们应该随时准备响应祖国的号召！
    现在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议已经在我们的首都——北京举行，这是具有伟大历史意义的一个会议。毛主席亲自领导起草的中华人民共和国宪法，就在今天要在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上制定了。宪法总结了我国人民长期奋斗获得的胜利成果，并将大大促进我国的社会主义建设事业。毛主席在大会开幕时指示我们：“我们的总任务是：团结全国人民，争取一切国际朋友的支援，为了建设一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗，为了保卫国际和平和发展人类进步事业而奋斗。”并号召我们要“老老实实，勤勤恳恳，互勉互助，力戒任何的虚夸和骄傲”。全国人民一定会遵循毛主席的伟大号召，一致为我们的崇高理想而努力奋斗！
    我们坚决相信胜利归来的志愿军同志们，将为保卫我们伟大祖国的社会主义事业、伟大祖国的宪法、伟大的祖国河山、伟大的祖国人民，而继续奋斗，发扬光荣的传统！
    欢迎胜利归来的中国人民志愿军！
    向英勇的中国人民志愿军致敬！
    继续为争取和平解决朝鲜问题而奋斗！
    中、朝人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    和平胜利万岁！
    中国人民伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
