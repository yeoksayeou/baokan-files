    Datong Mining Bureau Completes Third Quarter Coal Production Plan Ahead of Schedule
    All the workers of the Datong Mining Bureau completed the state coal production plan for the third quarter eleven days ahead of schedule on September 19th.
    The workers of the Datong Mining Bureau studied the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China and the joint declaration of all democratic parties and people's organizations for the liberation of Taiwan. The political consciousness and enthusiasm for building socialism of all workers have been generally improved, and their labor enthusiasm is particularly high. The convocation of the National People's Congress touched the hearts of every worker. Many groups, on the basis of overfulfilling the production plans for July and August, formulated action plans for increasing production and practicing economy, launched labor competitions, and constantly reported production successes. The two tunneling teams led by Ma Liu Hai and Lian Wanlu completed the August tunneling plan three days ahead of schedule. In September, they set a plan to advance 720 meters, and promoted advanced experience in production, saving a lot of explosives. After the 825 combine team of the Second Mine created a new record of 14,200 tons of monthly production in August, they regularly completed double-cycle operations every day in September, with a daily output of more than 500 tons. In August, the bureau's overall efficiency increased by 1.5 percent compared to July, and the number of fully completed backfill teams for the five major indicators increased by 50 percent compared to July. In September, the bureau completed the plan every day, especially the material consumption was generally reduced, and the balance rate was generally improved. Under the call to support the liberation of Taiwan, all workers exemplary executed the plan, consciously abided by labor discipline, and the attendance rate increased. In September, the attendance rate of each mine generally remained above 92 percent. At present, all employees are further developing the collective wisdom of the working class and launching labor competitions to strive for greater achievements. (Li Zixin)
