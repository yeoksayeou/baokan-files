    Protesting the American Fascist Anti-Communist Act
    Huang Gang
    The American ruling clique has further launched a fascist attack on all domestic democratic forces. Two years ago, in Washington, D.C., officials from the State Department removed the original manuscripts of the "Declaration of Independence" and the U.S. Constitution from public display and sealed them in a basement. Former President Truman presided over this burial ceremony with musical accompaniment; he said in his speech that this was "the saddest funeral in history." It was indeed "sad": the original manuscript of the "Declaration of Independence," which declared the principles of American bourgeois democracy and freedom more than 170 years ago, has become an obstacle on America's path to becoming a "police state"! If the souls of Washington and Jefferson, the creators of the U.S. Constitution, were still conscious, they would truly shed tears for these unworthy descendants.
    Unexpectedly, the recent autocratic measures of the U.S. Congress and Eisenhower are even more insane than those of their predecessor president; U.S. congressmen and the President, ignoring the opposition of honest public opinion in the U.S. and around the world, hastily passed and signed a reactionary bill declaring the American Communist Party illegal; this unprecedented bill in American history to outlaw a political party makes Eisenhower's governance even more like Hitler! Because everyone knows that this kind of anti-communist decree is a reprint of Hitler's German tyranny. Hitler and Mussolini in those days used anti-communism as a pretext to actually persecute and stifle all the rights and freedoms of the people...
    Who can say that American-style fascism—McCarthyism—attacks only communists? No, the primary question is not about agreeing or disagreeing with communism... To illustrate this point, it is enough to mention the "loyalty investigations" that have been implemented in the United States in recent years: Miss Jannette of California was only three years old, and when this little girl earned three dollars as a model, the U.S. government required her to sign a "loyalty" oath, swearing that "in the five years before filling out this oath," she had not participated in any organization that overthrew the government; otherwise, Jannette's mother would not receive the wages earned by her daughter. The same thing happened last year in San Francisco: sixty-seven children aged four to fifteen, in order to earn some money as servants during part of their vacation, were all ordered to go to the City Council to be sworn in—everyone had to swear that they had never been a communist. The American rulers, infected with anti-communist hysteria, are so fearful of their own destiny: they are even afraid of three-year-old girls and four-year-old boys. It is widely rumored that McCarthy himself, an American anti-communist congressman, always carries a gun with him because of his nervous tension; once, Monte, the acting chairman of the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, went to see McCarthy late at night. McCarthy pulled out his gun in his own house before opening the door...
    Terror looms over America. Medieval-style trials, the prevalence of lynching, the rampant secret police and political detectives, and the multi-faceted persecution of peace advocates... all of these cannot conceal the cowardice in the hearts of the American authorities. The American rulers, who have lost confidence in the future, are greatly slandering, defaming, and attacking the Communist Party, and want to use the bill declaring the American Communist Party illegal to stop the American people's dissatisfaction with the developing economic crisis and to hinder the development of the American people's movement to defend peace and fight for democracy. But it is precisely through this reactionary measure that people can see more clearly: what should be outlawed is the McCarthy demon who rules the U.S. Congress, not the American Communist Party, the defender of the American people's democratic and free rights. Everyone can see that the goal of the American Communist Party's struggle is for the American people to win a happy life, strive for employment and progress, and strive for peace and friendship among the people of all countries; although the servants of Wall Street are trying to imprison people's thoughts with the high walls of prisons, the truth cannot be extinguished by violence; the bright torch of peace and progress—the American Communist Party—will never be intimidated by the American fascist decrees.
    As early as 1950, after Comrade Dennis, the General Secretary of the American Communist Party, was imprisoned, Mrs. Dennis wrote in a letter to the American President that Christmas of that year: "Due to historical accident, you have the power to make my son lose his father. However, my son and I are very proud to know that Dennis is spending Christmas in prison this year because you and the warmongers you serve are afraid of Dennis, afraid of progressives, afraid of communist fighters, and afraid of the defenders of true peace in the world and international friendship among all nations." This kind of protest is equally applicable to the political situation in the United States today.
    Mrs. Dennis continued in that protest letter:
    "For hundreds of millions of people around the world, you, Mr. President, are a symbol of American guns, invading armies, and frightening atomic bombs. However, for the same hundreds of millions of people, Dennis, locked in prison, is a symbol of a fighting, progressive America. You feel that in order to realize Wall Street's dream of ruling or destroying, you must first chain this progressive America, make it silent... But tonight I send my wishes with great confidence: I firmly believe that the future will belong to the people, and Dennis and the party he leads are the flesh and blood of the people!"
    No fascist bill can separate the people from their own flesh and blood!
    The future of America will belong to the American people. The fate of McCarthy and his ilk—the American disciples of Hitler—will certainly not be better than the end of their master.

    抗议美国法西斯化的反共法案
    黄钢
    美国统治集团对国内一切民主力量，进一步地开始了法西斯化的进攻。两年以前，在美国首都华盛顿，国务院的官员们把“独立宣言”和美国宪法的原稿从公开展览的地方拿开了，封存在地下室里，前任总统杜鲁门当时在音乐伴奏中主持了这个埋葬仪式；他在演讲中说这是“历史上最悲哀的葬仪”。的确很“悲哀”：一百七十多年前宣布美国资产阶级民主自由原则的“独立宣言”的原稿，已经成为美国走向“警察国家”途中的障碍物了！如果美国宪法的缔造者——华盛顿和杰弗逊的灵魂还有知觉，那他们真会为这些不肖的子孙而掉泪哩。
    不料美国国会和艾森豪威尔最近的专横措施，比较起他们的前任总统，还要癫狂得多；美国议员们和总统先生，不顾美国和全世界正直舆论的反对，急急忙忙地通过和签署了宣布美国共产党为非法的反动法案；这一个美国历史上空前未有的取缔一个政党的法案，使艾森豪威尔的施政面貌更加和希特勒相像了！因为谁都知道，这种反共的法令，正是希特勒德国暴政的再版。当年的希特勒和墨索里尼都是以反共为名，实际是迫害和扼杀了人民的一切权利和自由……。
    谁能说美国式的法西斯主义——麦卡锡主义——所攻击的仅仅是共产党人呢？不，首先的问题还不是同意或不同意共产主义……为了说明这点，只要举出近几年来美国实行的“忠诚调查”就够了：加利福尼亚州的詹纳特小姐才不过是三岁，这个小姑娘因为当模特儿挣到了三块钱时，美国政府就要她签署一份“忠诚”宣誓书，要她发誓“在填写这个宣誓书以前的五年中”，没有参加过任何推翻政府的组织，否则，詹纳特的母亲就领不到女儿所挣得的工钱。同样的事情去年还发生在旧金山：六十七个四岁到十五岁的儿童，为了利用假期中的一部分时间当仆役赚点钱，他们都奉命结队到市议会去宣誓就职——每个人都要宣誓从来就不是共产党员。染上了反共歇斯底里症的美国统治者，就是这样地对于自己的命运怀抱着恐惧：他们甚至对三岁的女孩和四岁的男孩都害怕起来了。人们都盛传着：美国反共议员麦卡锡本人，他因为神经紧张的缘故，终日是枪不离身；有一次美国参议院常设调查小组委员会代理主席蒙特深夜去看麦卡锡，麦卡锡在自己的房子里先掏出了手枪，然后才去开门……
    恐怖笼罩着美国。中古式的审讯，私刑的流行，秘密警察和政治侦探的猖獗，对于和平拥护者的多方迫害……这些，都掩盖不了美国当权者内心的怯懦。丧失了明天的信心的美国统治者，大事诬蔑、诽谤和攻击共产党，并且想通过宣布美国共产党为非法的法案，来制止美国人民对于发展中的经济危机的不满、来阻挡美国人民保卫和平与争取民主运动的发展。但正是通过这一反动的措施，人们却更加清楚地看见了：应该取缔的是统治着美国国会的麦卡锡妖魔，而不是美国人民民主自由权利的保卫者——美国共产党。所有的人们都能够看见：美国共产党奋斗的目标是美国人民要赢得幸福的生活，争取就业和进步，争取各国人民间的和平友好；尽管华尔街的仆从们妄图用监狱的高墙去囚禁人们的思想，但是，真理是不可能用暴行来扑灭的；和平与进步的鲜明的火炬——美国共产党——也绝不会为美国法西斯的法令所吓倒。
    还在一九五○年，美共总书记丹尼斯同志入狱以后，丹尼斯夫人在那年圣诞节给美国总统的信中写道：“由于历史上的偶然，你有权使我的儿子失去了他的父亲。然而我的儿子和我非常骄傲地了解，丹尼斯今年在狱中度圣诞节，是因为你和你所服务的那些好战的人们，惧怕丹尼斯，惧怕进步人士，惧怕共产党战士与世界上真正的和平，以及各民族间国际友好的保卫者们。”这种抗议，同样地，也适用于今天美国的政治情况。
    丹尼斯夫人那封抗议信中继续写道：
    “对于全世界的数万万人民，你，总统先生，是美国枪炮、侵略军队和吓人的原子弹的象征。然而，对于同样数万万人民，关在监牢里的丹尼斯是战斗的进步美国的象征。你觉得为了实现华尔街统治或毁灭的梦魔，就必须先把这个进步的美国加上镣铐，使它变得沉默无言……但今夜我以高度的信心发出我的祝愿：我坚信未来将属于人民，而丹尼斯和他领导的党便是人民的血和肉！”
    任何法西斯的法案都不能使人民和自己的血肉分开！
    美国的未来将属于美国人民。麦卡锡之流——希特勒的美国门徒们的下场，绝不会比他们师父的结局更好。
