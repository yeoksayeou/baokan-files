　　Ambassador Dimov's eulogy:
　　Comrade Chairman:
　　I have the honor to present to you the credentials of the Presidium of the National Assembly of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, appointing me as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the People's Republic of China, and the letter of recall of the former Ambassador.
　　Comrade Chairman, please allow me, in the name of the Presidium and the Government of the National Assembly of the People's Republic of Bulgaria and the Bulgarian people, to express my respects to you and the great Chinese people.
　　The Bulgarian people cherish the most sincere friendship for the great Chinese people and are heartily gratified by the great achievements the Chinese people have made in the economic, cultural, and national construction fields. The achievements of the Chinese people in the cause of planned development of the national economy on the road to socialism and in the struggle against aggression and consolidation of peace in the Far East and the world, and the achievements of the Bulgarian people in the cause of building the foundations of socialism, are a solid foundation for further developing and consolidating the friendly ties between our two peoples.
　　The heroic struggle of the Chinese people for their own liberation and national independence, and the struggle to defend peace in Asia and the world—which it waged so flexibly and successfully at the Geneva Conference—have won it the sympathy of all progressive mankind. The heroic example of the great Chinese people has inspired the enslaved peoples of Southeast Asia and the Pacific countries who are now fighting for their independence and happiness.
　　The great assistance our two peoples have received from the great Soviet Union, and the fact that our two peoples are both in the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, are guarantees for further achievements in the struggle of the Chinese and Bulgarian peoples for peace and socialism.
　　I am happy to represent the Presidium and the Government of the National Assembly of the People's Republic of Bulgaria and the Bulgarian people in wishing you, The Central People’s Government and the Chinese people new achievements in the great cause of building a strong and democratic New China.
　　Comrade Chairman, as I assume the post of Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the People's Republic of Bulgaria to the People's Republic of China, I would like to assure you that I will contribute all my strength to consolidate and further develop the relations between our two peoples, and I hope that in this regard, I will receive the assistance and support of you and the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China.
　　Chairman Mao Zedong's reply:
　　Comrade Ambassador:
　　I am very pleased to accept the credentials presented by the Presidium of the National Assembly of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, and I sincerely thank you for your congratulations.
　　The fraternal friendship between the People's Republic of China and the People's Republic of Bulgaria, and the close cooperation in political, economic, and cultural fields, have been greatly developed. This has not only promoted the prosperity and happiness of the two peoples but also strengthened the world's peace and democratic forces headed by the great Soviet Union.
　　The brilliant achievements made by the Bulgarian people in the cause of socialist construction under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party in the ten years after their liberation have inspired the labor enthusiasm of the Chinese people who are engaged in socialist construction and the socialist transformation.
　　Comrade Ambassador, I warmly welcome you to your post as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the People'
