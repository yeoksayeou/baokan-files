    Moscow University is the Soviet Union's first famous institution of higher learning. It has enrolled many new students. In addition to the thirty-two nationalities of the Soviet Union, it has also enrolled several hundred students from China and other People's Democracies. This year, the first year of the twelve departments enrolled 3,350 young people, and 1,550 new students for correspondence courses.
    On this day, 16,500 students reunited with professors and lecturers, and more than 5,000 people continued their correspondence studies.
    There are more than 1.5 million students in higher education institutions throughout the Soviet Union this year, including 450,700 new students. The various agricultural colleges have enrolled more than 31,000 people.
    In the new academic year, approximately 12,000 secondary schools in the Russian Federation alone have about 16 million students studying. The Russian Federation alone has opened 1,570 new secondary schools. The number of students studying in the 8th, 9th, and 10th grades of secondary schools in the Russian Federation has increased by 536,000 compared to the previous academic year. Secondary schools in Moscow, Leningrad, and other large cities, which have implemented separate schools for boys and girls since 1943, are now beginning to have boys and girls study together again.
    The new teaching plan for Soviet secondary schools this year stipulates that schools should be more closely linked to life and practice, cultivate students' labor habits, and more widely promote comprehensive technical education. At the same time, in order to avoid overburdening students, some minor materials have been reduced.
    Many young people have entered secondary technical schools. Technical schools, railway schools, mining schools, and various technical schools will train skilled workers in 150 different occupations this academic year.
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 3rd: Schools at all levels in northern Korea started simultaneously on September 1st. At the beginning of the new academic year, more than 1.8 million elementary, middle, and high school students in northern Korea are enrolled in school.

Pyongyang alone restored and newly built more than ten universities, technical colleges, middle schools, and more than twenty elementary schools, with a total of 504 classrooms. Schools at all levels have generally enrolled new students. It is estimated that more than 270,000 new students will be enrolled in elementary schools nationwide this year, but the actual number has exceeded this figure. In order to train a large number of specialized technical talents to meet the needs of post-war reconstruction, the number of students in various technical colleges has also increased significantly. This year, the number of students in Korean technical colleges in construction, industry, agriculture, and railways has increased by 25.7% compared to last year and by 36.4% compared to 1949 before the war.
    Xinhua News Agency, September 2nd: According to the Polish Press Agency in Warsaw: The new academic year of 1954 has begun, and schools at all levels in Poland have gradually started classes from September 1st.

The number of primary and secondary schools and correspondence classes for employed workers has also increased. This year, more than 97,000 workers will study in these schools without leaving production, an increase of approximately 11,000 from the previous academic year. The number of new students enrolled in various engineering colleges, agricultural colleges, and medical colleges is nine times, four times, and five times that of pre-war levels, respectively. In order to vigorously develop agriculture, Poland attaches great importance to training specialized agricultural talents. In this academic year, the number of new students in secondary agricultural schools has increased by 33% compared to the previous academic year. In addition, many training courses have been established to train talents in various sectors of agriculture.
    Xinhua News Agency, September 2nd: According to TASS, Prague: Schools at all levels in Czechoslovakia started on September 1st. Thousands of students have begun a new and intense study life from this day.

From the new academic year, schools in Czechoslovakia will teach according to a unified national teaching syllabus. New textbooks have been compiled according to the new teaching syllabus. Secondary schools will implement comprehensive technical education to cultivate students' love of labor. Correspondence classes attached to various universities have been greatly expanded, enabling more on-the-job technicians and workers to receive higher education. In the bourgeois era, there were only nine universities in the country, with 19,000 students, but now, the number of universities has increased to 39, with 47,000 students.
