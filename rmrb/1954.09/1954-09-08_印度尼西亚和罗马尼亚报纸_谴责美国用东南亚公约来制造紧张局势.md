Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, September 6th: The "People's Daily" published a commentary in Jakarta on the 6th, stating that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization meeting launched by Dulles today has been opposed by almost all Asian countries. Six of the eight participating countries are not Southeast Asian countries, and the three participating Asian countries (including Pakistan) have all concluded military treaties with the United States. Among other Southeast Asian countries (including Indonesia), opposition to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is growing.

　　Jakarta's "News Weekly" last week condemned the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization as a conspiracy to "divide Southeast Asian countries."

　　Jakarta's "National Pioneer" stated, "Participating in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is of no benefit to Indonesia. It will only throw Indonesia into a vortex of hostility. Indonesia hopes to engage in construction, and without a safe, peaceful, and calm environment, construction is impossible."

　　Surabaya's "Peace Daily" condemned the United States for "forcing Asian countries to follow it and letting Asians fight Asians." It said, "The United States' real purpose is to create disaster in Asia," and said, "We don't think it's good to participate in the war. We don't see the danger of so-called communist aggression. We have not heard that the Soviet Union or the People's Republic of China is preparing to attack Southeast Asia."

　　Surabaya's other "Social Trumpet" condemned the United States for using the Southeast Asia Treaty to create tension.

　　Makassar's "People's Guide" said, "There is no reason to believe that the United States wants peace."

Xinhua News Agency, September 6th: According to the Romanian News Agency, Bucharest, September 5th: "Free Romania" published an article entitled "On the Eve of the Manila Conference," commenting on the meeting to cobble together a Southeast Asian military bloc scheduled to be held in the Philippine capital on the 6th. The newspaper wrote: The fact that the gunfire in Indochina stopped shortly after the armistice in Korea was not to Washington's liking. Even more displeasing to them is that lasting friendly relations are increasingly consolidating among major Asian countries, primarily between the People's Republic of China and India, a relationship bound to lead to the consolidation of the peace, security, and independence of the peoples of Asia. The rising prestige of the People's Republic of China in the world, especially in Asia, and the upsurge of the national liberation struggles of the peoples of Asia, hinder the United States' plans to expand and dominate the world.

　　The newspaper said: Just by looking at the countries participating in this conference, one can recognize the colonial and aggressive nature of this planned alliance. What kind of Asian treaty is a treaty whose members are mostly non-Asian countries, openly resisted by major Southeast Asian countries—India, Indonesia, Burma, and Ceylon—and whose spearhead is aimed at the largest Asian country, the People's Republic of China?

　　The newspaper concluded: However, Asian countries have made clear their attitude toward the United States' aggressive conspiracy in Southeast Asia. The aggressive Southeast Asian Treaty Organization planned by Washington has been spurned by Asian countries. The fact that important Asian politicians such as Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo, as well as the entire Asian public opinion, have taken a stand against the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization clearly shows that the peoples of Asian countries refuse to be pawns in the hands of the U.S. ruling clique to defend Washington's interests. The peoples of Asian countries need genuine security, not the "security" suggested by Dulles and his partners. They understand very well how to strengthen the ties of friendship—friendship for peace—between their countries to guarantee this security.

### 印度尼西亚和罗马尼亚报纸  谴责美国用东南亚公约来制造紧张局势

    印度尼西亚和罗马尼亚报纸
    谴责美国用东南亚公约来制造紧张局势
   【新华社雅加达六日电】在雅加达出版的“人民日报”六日发表评论说，今天开幕的杜（勒斯）制东南亚公约组织会议几乎受到所有亚洲国家的反对。八个参加国家中有六个国家不是东南亚国家，而参加的三个亚洲国家（其中包括巴基斯坦）都是已和美国缔结了军事条约的国家。在其他东南亚国家（包括印度尼西亚）中，反对东南亚公约组织的情绪越来越高涨了。
    雅加达的“新闻周刊”上星期谴责东南亚公约组织是“分化东南亚国家”的阴谋。
      雅加达的“民族先锋报”说，“参加东南亚公约组织对于印度尼西亚一无好处。这只会把印度尼西亚投入敌对的漩涡。印度尼西亚希望进行建设，而没有安全、平静、和平的环境，要进行建设是不可能的。”
      泗水的“和平日报”谴责美国“强迫亚洲国家跟它走，让亚洲人打亚洲人”。它说，“美国的真正目的是在亚洲制造灾祸”，并说，“我们认为参加战争没有好处。我们看不到所谓共产党侵略的危险。我们没有听说苏联或中华人民共和国在准备进攻东南亚。”
    泗水另一家“社会号角报”谴责美国用东南亚公约来制造紧张局势。
    望加锡的“人民向导报”说，“没有理由认为美国希望和平。”
      【新华社六日讯】据罗马尼亚通讯社布加勒斯特五日讯：“自由罗马尼亚报”发表题为“马尼拉会议的前夕”的文章，评论定于六日在菲律宾首都举行的拼凑东南亚军事集团的会议。报纸写道：在朝鲜停战后不久，印度支那的枪声也停下来，这一事实是不合乎华盛顿的胃口的。更不合乎他们的胃口的是：在主要的亚洲国家之间，首先是在中华人民共和国和印度之间，持久的友好关系正在日益巩固，这种关系势必会导向亚洲各国人民的和平、安全和独立的巩固。中华人民共和国在全世界特别是在亚洲的日益提高的威信，以及亚洲各国人民民族解放斗争的高涨，阻挠了美国进行扩张和统治世界的计划。
    报纸说：只要看一下参加这个会议的国家，就可以认识到这个计划中的联盟的殖民主义性质和侵略性质。一个公约，其成员大部分是非亚洲国家，受到东南亚主要国家——印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸和锡兰——的公开抵制，而且它的矛头又是指向亚洲最大的国家中华人民共和国的，这还会是什么样的一种亚洲公约呢？
    报纸最后写道，但是亚洲国家已经清楚表明了它们对美国在东南亚的侵略阴谋的态度。华盛顿所策划的侵略性的东南亚公约遭到亚洲各国的唾弃。像印度总理尼赫鲁、印度尼西亚总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约等一些重要的亚洲政治家以及整个亚洲舆论，都采取了反对东南亚公约组织的态度，这清楚地显示了亚洲各国人民拒绝充当美国统治集团手下的保卫华盛顿利益的走卒。亚洲各国人民需要真正的安全，而不需要杜勒斯和他的伙伴们所建议的“安全”。他们非常清楚地了解怎样加强他们国家之间友谊——为和平服务的友谊——的联系来保证这种安全。
