Respected Ambassador, Comrades, Friends:
    Today is the ninth anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the first National Day of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam since the restoration of peace in Indochina. On this holiday of special significance, allow me, on behalf of the Government and people of the People's Republic of China, to extend warm congratulations and high respect to the Government and heroic people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    The eight-year war of resistance waged by the Vietnamese people under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh has written a glorious page in the history of the Vietnamese national liberation struggle. It has irrefutably proved to the world that a nation fighting for independence and freedom is bound to win.
    The Chinese people warmly welcome the Geneva Conference agreements on the restoration of peace in Indochina. These agreements are the result of the joint efforts of the people of Indochina and peace-loving countries and people all over the world, and primarily the result of the long-term struggle of the Vietnamese people. At the same time, they are also the result of the peaceful foreign policy pursued by the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The restoration of peace in Indochina has promoted the further relaxation of the international situation and opened the way for the peaceful settlement of other international disputes. However, the American aggressive bloc is not reconciled to the failure of its "policy of strength." At present, it is actively organizing opposing military blocs in Southeast Asia, attempting to obstruct the thorough implementation of the Indochina armistice agreement and undermine peace and security in Asia. For this reason, we must be vigilant and resolutely stop this conspiracy of the American aggressive bloc. The People's Republic of China is willing to work with relevant countries to thoroughly implement the Geneva agreements and establish collective peace in Asia.
    The people of China and Vietnam have always had close relations and profound friendship. In the peaceful days to come, economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries will be increasingly strengthened on the existing basis, and the fraternal friendship between the two peoples will be further developed and consolidated.
    We sincerely wish the Government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam new and greater victories in the future struggle to thoroughly realize the agreements on the restoration of peace in Indochina, for the realization of national unification, independence, and democracy, and in the work of rebuilding a life of peace.
    Long live the Democratic Republic of Vietnam!
    Long live the unbreakable friendship between the people of China and Vietnam!
    Long live the forces of peace headed by the Soviet Union!
    Long live world peace!
    Please raise your glasses to the health of President Ho Chi Minh, leader of the Vietnamese people!

### 朱德副主席的讲话

    朱德副主席的讲话敬爱的大使同志，各位同志，各位朋友：
    今天是越南民主共和国成立九周年纪念，又是印度支那和平恢复以后越南民主共和国的第一个国庆。在这具有特殊重大意义的节日，让我代表中华人民共和国政府和人民向越南民主共和国政府和英勇的越南人民致以热烈的祝贺和崇高的敬意。
    越南人民在胡志明主席领导下所进行的八年抗战，在越南民族解放斗争史上写下了光辉灿烂的一页。它已经无可辩驳地向全世界证明：一个为争取独立和自由而斗争的民族是一定会胜利的。
    中国人民热烈欢迎日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平问题的协议。这些协议是印度支那人民及全世界爱好和平的国家和人民从各方面共同努力的结果，并且首先是越南人民长期奋斗的结果，同时也是苏联和人民民主国家坚持和平外交政策的结果。印度支那和平的恢复促进了国际局势的进一步缓和，并为和平协商解决其他国际争端开辟了道路。但是，美国侵略集团并不甘心它的“实力政策”的失败。目前，它正在东南亚积极组织对立的军事集团，企图阻挠印度支那停战协定的彻底实施和破坏亚洲的和平和安全。为此，我们必须提高警惕，坚决制止美国侵略集团的这种阴谋活动。中华人民共和国愿意与有关国家共同为日内瓦协议的彻底实施和在亚洲建立集体和平而努力。
    中越两国人民历来有着密切的关系和深厚的友谊。在今后和平的日子里，两国间的经济、文化合作必将在现有基础上日益增强，两国人民间兄弟般的友谊也必将更进一步发展和巩固。
    我们谨祝：越南民主共和国政府和越南人民，在今后为彻底实现恢复印度支那和平的协议、为实现国家统一、独立和民主的斗争中，在重建和平生活的工作中，不断取得新的、更大的胜利。
    越南民主共和国万岁！
    中越两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的和平力量万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
    请大家举杯祝越南人民领袖胡志明主席健康！
