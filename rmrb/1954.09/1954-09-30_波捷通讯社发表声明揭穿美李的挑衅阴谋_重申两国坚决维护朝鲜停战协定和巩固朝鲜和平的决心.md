　　Xinhua News Agency, September 28th: Polish News Agency, Warsaw, September 27th dispatch: Recently, the Syngman Rhee government has intensified its provocations against the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea, especially launching a series of blatant attacks against the Polish and Czechoslovak members of the Commission. This time, the Syngman Rhee puppet government has issued another slanderous statement, accusing the Polish and Czechoslovak members of the commission of so-called espionage activities.
　　The Polish News Agency is instructed to issue a statement on this issue: As everyone knows, the Polish members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea strictly abide by the provisions of the Armistice Agreement, and they have been constantly making efforts to prevent those who are interested in maintaining tension in that region from undermining the Armistice Agreement.
　　Under these circumstances, the recent intensification of the slander campaign by the Syngman Rhee clique against the Polish and Czechoslovak members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is obviously based on various fabrications, in an attempt to divert people's attention from the Syngman Rhee clique's actions to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement.
　　These provocative acts are also part of the same policy of certain American imperialist groups. This policy is to use Chiang Kai-shek's remnants to carry out criminal attacks on the coastal areas of the People's Republic of China; to attempt to eliminate the situation of reconciliation in the Far East by piecing together an aggressive group in Southeast Asia - namely the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.
　　Polish representatives will continue to faithfully perform their duties in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and will oppose all attempts to undermine the Armistice Agreement, thereby contributing to the consolidation of peace in Korea and the further easing of international tensions.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 29th: Czechoslovak News Agency issued the following statement on the 26th:
　　The South Korean government published a statement in the "Daehanminguk Daily" on September 15th, making rude attacks on the Czechoslovak and Polish representatives in the inspection teams of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, which is supervising the Korean armistice. This statement is full of slanderous lies, fabricated according to the old, well-known and exposed methods.
　　The Czechoslovak and Polish representatives of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission are accused of engaging in espionage activities. This is not the first time, and it is done to prepare for the purpose of some representatives of the South Korean regime to obstruct the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. But like all previous examples, this provocation is also unskilled, and it only needs to present irrefutable facts to prove that this statement is fabricated.
　　For example: It is said that Captain Vaclav Vinar, the Czechoslovak representative of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, conducted propaganda to Korean employees at the Jiangling port in South Korea on May 12, 1954. On May 12, 1954, Captain Vinar was not only not in Jiangling, but not even in Korea at all. The authors of these "documents" were equally wrong about the activities of Lieutenant Colonel Cikanik, Captain Hardy, and other representatives. According to the accusation, Lieutenant Colonel Cikanik secretly took photos near Incheon on July 11, 1954. However, Lieutenant Colonel Cikanik has not been in Incheon since last December. Captain Hardy left Jiangling on July 15, 1954, but the "document" described in detail his activities at the above-mentioned port after July 20 this year. The facts presented above are enough to prove that the entire statement of the South Korean government is fabricated. Regarding the slander in the statement that the Czechoslovak and Polish representatives of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission secretly took "espionage" photos, it can be said that:
　　All activities of the Czechoslovak and Polish representatives in the inspection teams of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in South Korea have consistently complied with the provisions of the Armistice Agreement and conformed to the relevant instructions of the various agencies of the United Nations Command Headquarters. In addition, everyone knows that they are accompanied and supervised by military police at all times, and these military police control their actions with a notorious and almost interventionist attitude.
　　In this case, it is obvious that the photos published in the South Korean newspapers, which became the basis for Syngman Rhee's provocative accusations, are fabricated, just as all the statements in Syngman Rhee's statement are inaccurate.
　　The purpose of this provocation is very obvious. The South Korean puppet government, acting on the orders of the American aggressive groups, is trying everything possible to make it easier for American war materials to be transported to South Korea and to militarize South Korea, in order to make it impossible to comply with the Armistice Agreement, to dissolve the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and to take the opportunity to open the way to prepare for new aggression.

    波捷通讯社发表声明揭穿美李的挑衅阴谋
    重申两国坚决维护朝鲜停战协定和巩固朝鲜和平的决心
    【新华社二十八日讯】波兰通讯社华沙二十七日电：最近李承晚政府加紧对在朝鲜的中立国监察委员会进行挑衅，特别是对委员会中的波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员进行了一系列的蛮横的攻击。这次，李承晚傀儡政府又发表了一个污蔑性的声明，在声明中指责委员会中的波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员进行所谓间谍活动。
    波兰通讯社奉命就这个问题发表声明：大家知道，朝鲜的中立国监察委员会中的波兰委员是严格遵守停战协定的规定的，他们一直不停地进行努力，防止那些对在那个地区保持紧张状态感到兴趣的人破坏停战协定。
    在这种情况下，最近李承晚集团加紧对中立国监察委员会中波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员的诽谤运动显然是以各种虚构为依据的，这是企图使人们不注意李承晚集团破坏朝鲜停战协定的行为。
    这些挑衅行为也是某些美帝国主义者集团的同一政策的一部分。这种政策是利用蒋介石残余分子对中华人民共和国的沿海地区进行罪恶的袭击；企图以拼凑东南亚侵略集团——即东南亚条约组织——来消除远东的和解局面。
    波兰代表将继续忠实地执行他们在中立国监察委员会中的职务，并将反对一切破坏停战协定的企图，从而对巩固朝鲜的和平和进一步缓和国际紧张局势作出贡献。
    【新华社布拉格二十九日电】捷克斯洛伐克通讯社二十六日发表声明如下：
    南朝鲜政府九月十五日在“大韩民国报”发表一篇声明，对监督朝鲜停战的中立国监察委员会视察小组中的捷克斯洛伐克和波兰代表进行无礼的攻击。这篇声明尽是诬蔑性谎言，是根据老一套的、人所共知的和已被揭露的方法捏造的。
    中立国监察委员会的捷克斯洛伐克和波兰代表被诬蔑为从事间谍活动，这已不是第一次，这样做是为了实现南朝鲜政权某些代表阻挠中立国监察委员会工作的目的作准备。但是和以往所有的例子一样，这次的挑衅也是毫无技巧的，只须提出无可驳斥的事实，便可证明这篇声明是出于捏造。
    例如：据说中立国监察委员会的捷克斯洛伐克代表瓦茨拉夫·维纳尔上尉曾在一九五四年五月十二日在南朝鲜的江陵口岸向朝鲜雇员进行宣传。一九五四年五月十二日维纳尔上尉不仅没有在江陵，而且根本不在朝鲜。这些“文件”的作者在关于齐卡尼克中校、哈迪马上尉和其他代表的活动时也同样错了。根据指责，齐卡尼克中校曾在一九五四年七月十一日在仁川附近偷拍照片。然而自去年十二月以来，齐卡尼克中校便不在仁川。哈迪马上尉在一九五四年七月十五日离开江陵，然而“文件”却详细叙述他在今年七月二十日以后在上述口岸的活动情形。以上提出的事实，足以证明南朝鲜政府的整个声明全是捏造。关于声明中诬蔑中立国监察委员会的捷克斯洛伐克和波兰代表偷拍“谍报”照片方面，可以说：
    凡是在南朝鲜的中立国监察委员会视察小组中的捷克斯洛伐克和波兰代表的一切活动，是一贯遵守停战协定的规定和符合联合国军总部各个机构的有关指示的。此外，大家都知道，他们每时每刻都受到军事警察的伴随和监督，这些军事警察以声名狼藉的几乎是干涉的态度来管制他们的行动。
    在这种情况下，很明显，南朝鲜报纸所发表的成为李承晚的挑衅性指责的根据的照片，是捏造的，正和李承晚声明中的所有说法一样不确。
    这种挑衅的目的非常明显。奉行美国侵略集团的命令的南朝鲜傀儡政府正在用一切办法力图使美国战争物资可以更方便地运往南朝鲜，并使南朝鲜军事化，以期使停战协定无法遵守，使中立国监察委员会得以解散，并想借此打开准备进行新侵略的道路。
