    In order to ensure that cotton cloth can be produced and distributed in accordance with the state plan, further crack down on market speculation, and consolidate price stability, it is decided to implement the planned purchase (hereinafter referred to as unified purchase) and planned supply (hereinafter referred to as unified sale) of cotton cloth nationwide starting from September 15, 1954. The implementation measures are as follows:
    1. From the date of the announcement of the implementation of planned purchase and planned supply of cotton cloth, all machine-spun cotton cloth and machine-spun hand-spun yarn interwoven cotton cloth produced by state-owned, cooperative, joint state-private, and private weaving mills, printing and dyeing mills, and handicraft industries shall be uniformly purchased and sold by the state-owned China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation, and shall not be sold independently. In areas where the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation has not yet established institutions, this unified purchase and unified sale work shall be handled by other state-owned commercial institutions or supply and marketing cooperatives entrusted by the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation.
    2. All existing cotton cloth needed for production turnover in the weaving industry and cotton cloth reproduction industry shall be registered and managed by the local industrial and commercial or commercial administrative departments.

Cotton cloth woven entirely from hand-spun yarn shall be purchased by the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation through supply and marketing cooperatives and gradually incorporated into the scope of planned purchase and planned supply. Within a certain area, hand-spun yarn weaving households and consumers may be allowed to conduct a small amount of direct exchange.
    4. All cotton cloth and cotton cloth reproductions listed in the planned supply scope of the Ministry of Commerce of the Central People's Government shall be supplied nationwide according to regions, quantities, and vouchers, regardless of pattern, variety, and quality, and planned supply shall be implemented. However, remote areas with particularly sparse populations and inconvenient transportation may postpone implementation with the approval of the people's governments of provinces and autonomous regions.
    5. The supply quota of cloth for people's consumption throughout the country shall be specifically stipulated by the people's governments of each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government within the control figures stipulated by the Ministry of Commerce of the Central People's Government, based on cotton cloth resources and the different purchasing power levels of urban and rural people in different regions.
    6. The amount of cloth for industrial use, reproduction industrial use, and production use by boat people, fishermen, etc., shall be supplied by the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation with the approval of the local industrial and commercial administrative departments according to the needs of their normal production and use, and shall be managed.
    7. Public cloth for government agencies and people's various special needs, such as childbirth, marriage, death, and disasters, should be given necessary supply under the principle of promoting thrift.

    9. Private cotton cloth wholesalers shall not continue to engage in the wholesale and transportation business of cotton cloth, and all existing cotton cloth shall be uniformly purchased by the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation. People's governments at all levels should actively guide the employees of cotton cloth wholesalers to change their careers; those who cannot change their careers shall be arranged by the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation and supply and marketing cooperatives respectively under the leadership of the local people's government.
    All existing cotton cloth and cotton cloth reproductions belonging to the planned supply scope of private retailers and peddlers should be registered with the local people's government's industrial and commercial or commercial administrative departments and sold in accordance with the provisions of the planned supply.

    中央人民政府政务院
    关于实行棉布计划收购和计划供应的命令
    （一九五四年九月九日政务院第二百二十四次政务会议通过）
    为了保证棉布能够按照国家的计划进行生产和分配，进一步取缔市场投机，巩固物价稳定，决定自一九五四年九月十五日开始，在全国范围内实行棉布的计划收购（简称统购）和计划供应（简称统销）。实施办法如下：
    一、自宣布棉布实行计划收购和计划供应之日起，所有国营、合作社、公私合营和私营织布厂、印染厂和手工业生产的机纱棉布和机纱手纺纱交织棉布，一律由国营中国花纱布公司统购、统销，不得自行出售。在中国花纱布公司尚未设立机构的地区，此项统购、统销工作，由中国花纱布公司委托其他国营商业机构或供销合作社办理。
    二、所有织布业和棉布复制工业生产周转所需现存的棉布，由当地工商或商业行政部门进行登记，并加以管理。
    三、完全用手纺纱织成的棉布，由中国花纱布公司通过供销合作社进行收购，逐步纳入计划收购和计划供应的范围。在一定地区范围内，可允许手纺纱织布户和消费者直接进行少量的交换。
    四、所有列入中央人民政府商业部计划供应范围的棉布及棉布复制品，不论花色、品种和质量，在全国范围内，一律采取分区、定量、凭证供应的办法，实行计划供应。但人口特别稀少、交通不便的边远地区，经省、自治区人民政府批准，可暂缓实行。
    五、全国各地人民消费用布的供应定量，应根据棉布的资源和不同地区城乡人民不同的购买力水平，在中央人民政府商业部规定各地区的控制数字范围内，由各省、自治区、直辖市人民政府具体规定。
    六、工业用布、复制工业用布和船民、渔民等生产用布，按其正常生产和使用情况的需要量，经当地工商行政部门核准，由中国花纱布公司供应，并进行管理。
    七、机关团体公用布和人民的各种特殊需要，如新生、结婚、死亡和灾害等用布，应在提倡节约的原则下，给予必要的供应。
    八、购布凭证，不准买卖投机。
    九、私营棉布批发商不得继续经营棉布的批发、贩运业务，现存的棉布一律由中国花纱布公司统购。各级人民政府对棉布批发商的从业人员，应积极辅导其转业；无法转业者，在当地人民政府领导下，由中国花纱布公司、供销合作社分别安置。
    所有私营零售商、贩现存的棉布和属于计划供应范围的棉布复制品，应向当地人民政府工商或商业行政部门进行登记，按照计划供应的规定出售。国营商业通过国家资本主义的经销、代销等方式，对经营棉布和棉布复制品的私营零售商、贩，按照计划供应棉布和棉布复制品，并管理其零售价格和商品质量，督促其努力改善经营，为消费者服务。
    十、棉布实行计划供应后，所有国营零售商店，合作社零售商店和国家资本主义性质的零售商店、商贩，应一律按照当地人民政府商业行政部门所规定的零售价格出售。
    十一、各省、自治区、直辖市人民政府可根据本命令制定因地制宜的管理办法，经常进行监督检查；对破坏棉布计划收购和计划供应的投机分子和反革命分子，应依法惩处。
                                              总理　周恩来
                                        一九五四年九月十四日
