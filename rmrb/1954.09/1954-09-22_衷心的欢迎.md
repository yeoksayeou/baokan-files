    Heartfelt Welcome
    Xu Changrong
    A brightly colored arch, ten meters high, stands on the banks of the Yalu River, facing the swiftly flowing water. The arch is covered with colorful lights and adorned with beautiful golden patterns. On either side of the arch stand two models of Young Pioneers, meticulously crafted from plywood. The boy, dressed in a white shirt, strikes a solemn salute. The girl, in a light blue dress, holds two bouquets of flowers, a smile on her face, in a graceful pose as if running towards the Yalu River Bridge. The people of Andong City have erected this solemn triumphal arch to welcome their victorious sons and daughters returning home. Nearly four years ago, when war threatened the peaceful construction of the motherland, the people of Andong City personally sent off countless heroic sons and daughters of the motherland to cross the river and extinguish the flames of war ignited by the American aggressors. Today, they will gather here again to welcome back the heroic sons and daughters they personally sent off. Who could not be moved by this?
    On the morning of the 20th, the usually quiet banks of the Yalu River were already crowded with welcoming people. They were eagerly awaiting the heroic sons and daughters of the motherland who were about to cross the river.
    In the distance, a wisp of green smoke rose. Then, the massive roar of a train. The train sped from the magnificent Yalu River Bridge. At the head of the bridge, a song of victory resounded. Shouts, applause, and singing erupted from the crowd and from the train.
    As soon as the train stopped at the station, the welcoming crowd surged forward.
    The soldiers jumped out of the carriages one by one, excitedly throwing themselves into the cheering crowd. The station immediately erupted in a frenzy of activity. People shook hands, embraced, sang, and danced together. Countless open-air dance floors quickly formed on the platform. The soldiers were lifted up, the welcomers lifted up the soldiers, and the soldiers lifted up the welcomers!
    In front of one of the carriages, a group of soldiers was engaged in a warm and cordial conversation with an old woman of about fifty. The old woman, as if seeing long-lost family members, recounted everything on her mind to the soldiers. The soldiers were clearly deeply touched by the enthusiasm of this elder of the motherland, listening attentively. She spoke of the people's hatred for the enemy, their care and love for their own soldiers, the happy life they were now living, and the excitement of the masses when they heard the news that seven divisions of the Volunteer Army were returning. The soldiers grew angry, grateful, and excited as they listened to her narration.
    This was Auntie Jiao, the famous model for military dependents in Andong City. On October 25, 1950, she personally stood on the banks of the Yalu River, watching batches of the heroic sons and daughters of the motherland cross the Yalu River, and personally witnessed the towering flames of New Wiju burning. At that time, she secretly made a wish to work hard and support the Volunteer Army. In the Municipal Democratic Women's Federation, she worked on supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military families. Over the years, under the leadership of the People's Government, she arranged for batches of military families to be assigned to suitable jobs so that their loved ones could fight in Korea with peace of mind. Recently, she was transferred to the Third District Military Dependents Joint Sewing Department, serving as its director. When the workers learned of the news that the Volunteer Army was returning to the country, everyone was extremely excited. Letters of appreciation were sent to Auntie Jiao, asking her to deliver them personally to the Volunteer Army when she went to the station to welcome them. In their spare time, they also made a red satin banner, with the words "Dedicated to the Peace Defenders, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army." Now, she stood before the Volunteer Army soldiers, carrying her own sentiments and the instructions of more than fifty workers.
    Listening to Auntie Jiao's talk, a soldier, with an excited heart, took off a commemorative badge given to him by a Korean child and respectfully pinned it on Auntie Jiao's chest. Auntie Jiao looked at the commemorative badge, and for a moment could not think of anything good to give him, so she gave the soldier the fountain pen she was carrying. What a precious gift! This fountain pen was the prize she received last year when she was named a model military dependent in the city. Her child had asked her for it three times, but she had been reluctant to give it to him. Now, she was giving it to the Volunteer Army soldier as a permanent souvenir!
    In another carriage, the welcoming crowd handed cups of boiled water to the soldiers, saying, "Drink, comrades, it's been many years since you drank water from the motherland!" In the carriage, the soldiers also used the teacups given to them by the people of the motherland to hand cups of boiled water to the welcoming people, saying, "Drink, folks, this is boiled water given to us by the Korean people, it's as sweet as the water from the motherland. In addition, we have also brought you the deep friendship of the Korean people for the Chinese people."
    In fact, the people of the motherland knew that they were bringing back to the motherland the most precious gift of all – peace, for which they had paid with blood and life. At the same time, many people's heroes and meritorious figures emerged. Zhong Jiyuan, who was sitting in this carriage, was one of them. Zhong Jiyuan was a deputy squad leader. In the famous battle to defend Height 99.2 of Yuyin Mountain, he led his soldiers to defend it for fifteen days and nights, repelling more than a dozen frantic attacks by platoons, companies, and battalions of the American aggressors, annihilating more than 400 enemies, and winning time and victory. For this victory, they not only experienced hard and tenacious fighting, but some comrades were wounded and bled, and even sacrificed their youthful lives. Glorious, these heroic sons and daughters of the motherland!
    Soon, the welcoming ceremony officially began. Gathered in the square in front of Andong Station were tens of thousands of people, including the delegation of the National

    衷心的欢迎
    徐长荣
    一座高达十公尺的彩门，在鸭绿江畔，迎着湍急流过的江水矗立着。彩门上布满了五颜六色的灯光，周围还镶有美丽的金黄色图案。彩门前面的两侧，站立着两个用胶合板精制的少年先锋队员的模型。男的身着白色的上衣，做出庄严的行队礼的姿势；女的身着浅蓝色的裙子，双手拿着两束鲜花，面带微笑，做出向鸭绿江桥奔跑着的优美的姿态，安东市的人民已经搭好这个庄严的凯旋门准备欢迎自己胜利归来的子弟兵。将近四年以前，当战争威胁着祖国的和平建设的时候，安东市的人民亲自送走了祖国的无数英雄子弟，过江去扑灭美国侵略者燃起的战火。今天，他们又将在这里来迎接自己亲自送走的英雄子弟，谁能不为这而激动呢？
    二十日的早晨，平时还是静悄悄的鸭绿江畔，早挤满了欢迎的人群，他们用急切的心情，盼望着快要过江的祖国英雄子弟。
    远处，升起了一股青烟。接着，是火车的巨大呼叫声。列车从雄伟的鸭绿江桥上疾驶而来。桥头上，高奏起胜利的歌曲。口号声、掌声、歌声，从人群中，从列车上爆发出来。
    列车在火车站上刚刚停下，欢迎的人群就迎了上去。
    战士们一个个兴奋地跳出车厢，投入了欢呼的人群。车站立即沸腾起来，只见人们在互相握手拥抱，一起唱歌跳舞。在月台上，很快就形成了无数个露天舞场。抬起来了，欢迎的人把战士们抬起来了，战士们也把欢迎的人抬起来了！
    在一节车厢前面，一群战士围着一个五十岁光景的老大娘在热烈亲切地交谈着。老大娘就像看到久别重逢的家人一样，向战士们叙述她想到的一切。战士们显然也被这个祖国老大娘的热情深深感动了，都在注意地听着。她说着人民对敌人的仇恨，对自己子弟兵的关心和热爱，说着目前幸福的生活，说着群众听到志愿军七个师要回归的消息时的兴奋。战士们随着她的叙述在愤怒、感激和兴奋。
    这就是安东市的著名军属模范缴大娘。一九五零年十月二十五日，她亲自站在鸭绿江边，看着祖国的英雄子弟一批批地跨过了鸭绿江，也亲眼看见新义州燃烧起来的冲天的烟火。那时候，她就暗暗许下了心愿，要努力工作，支援志愿军。在市民主妇女联合会里，她做拥军优属工作，几年来，她在人民政府领导下，把成批的军人家属安排到适当的工作岗位上，使他们的亲人能在朝鲜安心打仗。最近，她又被调到第三区军属联营缝纫部，担任主任。当工人们知道了志愿军要归国的消息，每一个人的心情都非常激动。一封封的慰问信送到了缴大娘的手里，要她在去车站欢迎的时候，亲手送给志愿军。在生产余暇，他们还抽空做了一面红缎子锦旗，上面写着：“献给和平保卫者中国人民志愿军”的字样。现在，她带着自己的心意，带着五十多个工人的嘱托，站在志愿军战士的面前了。
    听着缴大娘的谈话，一个战士，带着激动的心情，从自己胸前摘下了一枚朝鲜孩子赠给他的纪念章，恭恭敬敬地挂在缴大娘的胸前。缴大娘看着那枚纪念章，一时想不起来送他什么东西好，就把随身带的一支钢笔送到那个战士的手里。这是多么珍贵的礼物啊！这支钢笔是她去年她被评为市的军属模范时得到的奖品，她的孩子向她要过三次，她都没舍得给他。如今，却把它送给志愿军战士作为永久的纪念了！
    在另一个车厢里，慰问的人群把一杯杯的开水送到战士们的手里，他们说：“喝吧，同志们，好多年都没喝过祖国的水啦！”车厢里，战士们也用祖国人民送给他们的茶杯，把一杯杯的开水，亲手递到慰问的人们的手里。他们也说：“喝吧，乡亲们，这是朝鲜人民送给我们的开水，和祖国的水一样甜。另外，我们还给你们带来朝鲜人民对于中国人民的深厚友谊。”
    其实，祖国人民知道，他们带给祖国的还有人间最珍贵的礼物——和平，为此，他们付出了鲜血和生命。同时也涌现了不少的人民英雄和功臣。在这个车厢里坐着的锺继源就是这中间的一个。锺继源是副班长，在著名的鱼隐山九九点二高地的阻击战中，他带领战士坚守了十五昼夜，打退了美国侵略军班、排、连、营的十几次疯狂的进攻，歼敌四百多名，赢得了时间，取得了胜利。为了这一胜利，他们不但经历了艰苦顽强的战斗，还有的同志负了伤流了血，甚至献出了青春的生命。光荣啊，这些祖国的英雄子弟们！
    很快地，欢迎大会正式开始了。汇集在安东车站前面广场上的上万人群里，有人民政协全国委员会和中国人民抗美援朝总会欢迎中国人民志愿军归国部队的代表团，也有辽宁省和安东市党、政、军、民各界的代表。有来自车间的工人，有来自农业生产合作社的农民，有机关的干部，也有学校的学生和街道的居民。他们代表着全国人民的心意，在这里举行盛大的欢迎会，来欢迎胜利归国的祖国人民英雄的子弟。
    来了，这是归国的英雄子弟。看，一个个多魁梧啊！他们是来自天德山和月夜山英雄连的、来自艾山江堤和见龙贮水池工地的。他们是来自不朽的国际主义战士罗盛教生前所在连队的，来自一级战斗英雄李家发生前所在连队的……。罗盛教、李家发，都不能和他们一块回来了，而且永远不能了！但是，他们的国际主义和爱国主义的精神，却在祖国人民的心里生了根，开了花，结了果！
    一群天真活泼的孩子跑了上去，把一束束的鲜花递到志愿军叔叔的手里，志愿军同志们双手接过来鲜花，把它和孩子们一块抱起来了。抱吧，紧紧地抱吧，志愿军同志们！这就是在你们保卫下成长的祖国幸福的孩子！
    这里虽然有着上万的人群，但却只有一个心意。正像人民政协全国委员会和抗美援朝总会欢迎志愿军归国部队代表团团长王从吾、和志愿军归国部队代表陈发洪在大会上所讲的，我们要继续为争取和平解决朝鲜问题和解放祖国的领土台湾而奋斗，为祖国的社会主义建设而奋斗。
