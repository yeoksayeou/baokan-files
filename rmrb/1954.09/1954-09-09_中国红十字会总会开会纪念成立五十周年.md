Xinhua News Agency, September 8th: The China Red Cross Society held a commemorative meeting in Beijing on the evening of September 8th to mark the fiftieth anniversary of its founding. Attending the commemorative meeting were Li Dequan, President of the China Red Cross Society; Xu Yunbei, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government; Hu Lansheng, Vice President and Secretary-General of the China Red Cross Society; Ni Feijun, Deputy Secretary-General; advisors, standing directors, and directors; Fang Shishan, Secretary-General of the Chinese Medical Association; well-known figures from the capital's medical and health circles; personnel from relevant agencies and organizations; and more than 4,000 members of the Red Cross Societies from various districts of Beijing.

Also invited to attend the commemorative meeting were Polderev, leader of the Soviet Expert Group of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government; Bazhenov, Director of the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital; Zhu Zhongli, Deputy Director; and more than 50 Soviet experts from the Beijing Hospital.

At the beginning of the meeting, Vice President Hu Lansheng read the congratulatory telegram from the Union of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies of the Soviet Union to Li Dequan, and announced that Li Dequan had also received congratulatory telegrams from the League of Red Cross Societies and the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital.

Then, Li Dequan, President of the China Red Cross Society, delivered a speech. She explained that today (September 8th) is not only to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the China Red Cross Society, but also to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the reorganization of the China Red Cross Society. After briefly recounting the early history of the China Red Cross Society, she pointed out that due to the control of the reactionary rulers before liberation, the China Red Cross Society could only carry out some passive relief, medical treatment, rescue and other activities, and its work had to fall into stagnation day by day; its influence among the masses also gradually weakened. Next, Li Dequan described the various works of the China Red Cross Society after its reorganization into a people's own health and rescue organization after liberation, and listed the various efforts made by the China Red Cross Society in the past four years in coordinating the economic construction of the motherland, promoting primary health training, and promoting international peace and cooperation, maintaining humanitarian principles, and eliminating human disasters. She emphasized that the China Red Cross Society today is an active force capable of participating in the struggle to build a better life, providing various medical services for the working people, and promoting revolutionary humanitarianism of saving lives and helping the wounded; it will more widely absorb the broad masses of the people to participate in its various activities and give full play to its role as an assistant to the government health departments.

Bazhenov, Director of the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital, spoke amidst warm applause. He said: The staff of our Soviet Red Cross Hospital particularly appreciate the noble work of the China Red Cross Society. We are very excited to see the increase in the number of members of the China Red Cross Society and the health and preventive education measures carried out among the residents. He, on behalf of the Soviet Red Cross Hospital, congratulated the China Red Cross Society on its further achievements in the development of its work and the strengthening of the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people.

Yan Jingqing, President of the Beijing Branch of the China Red Cross Society and Director of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Health Bureau, also spoke at the meeting and congratulated the meeting on behalf of the Beijing Municipal People's Government. An evening party was held after the meeting.

    中国红十字会总会开会纪念成立五十周年
      【新华社八日讯】中国红十字会总会九月八日晚在北京举行了中国红十字会成立五十周年纪念大会。参加纪念大会的有中国红十字会总会会长李德全，中央人民政府卫生部副部长徐运北，中国红十字会总会副会长兼秘书长胡兰生、副秘书长倪斐君和顾问、常务理事和理事以及中华医学会秘书长方石珊、首都医药卫生界知名人士、各有关机关和团体的人员、北京市各区红十字会会员等共四千多人。
    中央人民政府卫生部苏联专家组组长波尔德列夫，北京苏联红十字医院院长巴任诺夫、副院长朱仲丽和苏联专家以及北京医院的苏联专家等五十余人也应邀参加了纪念大会。
    大会开始后，首由副会长胡兰生宣读了苏联红十字会与红新月会联合会致李德全的贺电，并宣布李德全同时收到红十字会协会和北京苏联红十字医院的贺电。
    接着由中国红十字会总会会长李德全致词。她说明今天（九月八日）不仅要纪念中国红十字会成立五十周年，同时也纪念中国红十字会改组四周年。她概要地叙述了中国红十字会早年的历史后指出，解放以前由于反动统治者的控制，中国红十字会只能进行一些消极的赈济、施诊、抢救等等活动，它的会务活动也就不能不日甚一日地陷于停滞；在群众中的影响也就日趋减弱。接着，李德全叙述了中国红十字会在解放以后改组成为一个人民自己的卫生救护团体之后的各项工作，列举了中国红十字会四年来在配合祖国经济建设，推行初级卫生训练和为促进国际和平合作、维护人道原则、免除人类灾难等方面所作的各项努力。她着重指出：中国红十字会今天已是能够参加到建设美好生活的斗争之中，为劳动群众进行各种医疗服务，并发扬救死扶伤的革命人道主义的积极力量；它将会更广泛地吸收广大人民群众参加它的各项活动，充分发挥它作为政府卫生部门的助手的作用。
    北京苏联红十字医院院长巴任诺夫在热烈的掌声中讲话。他说：我们苏联红十字医院的工作人员特别体会到中国红十字会的崇高的工作。我们非常兴奋地看到中国红十字会会员数目的增加和在居民中进行的卫生预防教育措施。他代表苏联红十字医院祝贺中国红十字会会务的发展和加强中苏人民的友谊方面得到进一步的成就。
    中国红十字会北京市分会会长、北京市人民政府公共卫生局局长严镜清也在会上讲话，并代表北京市人民政府向大会致贺。会后举行了晚会。
