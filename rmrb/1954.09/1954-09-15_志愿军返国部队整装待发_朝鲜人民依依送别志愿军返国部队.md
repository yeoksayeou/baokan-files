Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 14th: Seven divisions of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, soon to withdraw from Korea and return home, are ready to depart. The vanguard of these forces, including tanks, artillery, and infantry, has begun moving along several wide roads toward the railway station.

The soldiers of the returning units are filled with excitement and joy. Before their departure, they meticulously cleaned their cannons and various weapons. Tank crewmen wrote the numbers of enemies they had eliminated since entering the war in Korea on their tanks. They said, "These are the weapons the people of the motherland entrusted to us. We must report to the people of the motherland on our performance of the mission to resist US aggression and aid Korea." Many people neatly hung the various medals and awards conferred by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as well as the commemorative medals for resisting US aggression and aiding Korea given by the people of the motherland, on their chests. Soldiers from all units are discussing how to greet the people of the motherland, from whom they have been separated for nearly four years, and expressing their gratitude for the support of the people of the motherland.

Before leaving their garrisons, the soldiers visited the vegetable gardens they had cultivated and the houses, canals, and schools they had helped the Korean people build. They bid farewell to the Korean people from door to door, and to the Korean government, the People's Army, and the Volunteer Army units continuing to guard the front lines to protect the victory of the Korean armistice. During the farewells, they exchanged commemorative gifts with the Korean people, expressing their gratitude for the long-term sincere care and support they had received from the Korean military and civilians. They wished them final victory in the struggle for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. They said: We came for peace, and we leave for peace. We will always care for and support the Korean people and fight to defend national independence and the cause of peace. During the farewells, they also repeatedly encouraged the Volunteer Army units remaining in Korea to continue to vigilantly guard their positions and strive to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.
Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 14th: The Korean people, with a feeling of reluctance to part, flocked to the garrisons of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to bid farewell to the returning units.

More than 300 women from the hometown of Cho Byung-soo, a "Hero of the Republic" of Korea, rushed to wash quilts and military uniforms for the Volunteer Army soldiers upon hearing that nearby Volunteer Army units were returning to China. Cho Byung-soo's elderly mother, Wu Dong-yeol, also rushed to wash six military uniforms for the soldiers, and she specially ironed the uniforms and personally handed them to the soldiers to wear. She said:
	"Go, return home wearing clean clothes; your Chinese mothers will be pleased. After you return home, write us letters." An old soldier named Li Xin-zan from Pyeongam-ri wrote a seven-character ancient poem praising the benevolent and righteous army and presented it to the returning Volunteer Army units. He said: "When our motherland was invaded, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army resolutely used their lives and blood to help us. After the armistice, the Volunteer Army actively helped us rebuild our homes. Our descendants will never forget the merits of the Volunteer Army." Kim Bok-hwa, a student at Goksan County Girls' Middle School, and her female classmates knitted a woolen vest overnight with the five Korean characters "For the Struggle for Peace" on it and presented it to the returning Volunteer Army units. Korean women also gave the returning Volunteer Army units many shirt collars trimmed with red and green edges and handkerchiefs embroidered with the four characters "Korean-Chinese Friendship." Lee Ki-bong, a Korean child who was saved from a serious illness by Chen Ying, a doctor from the Third Battalion of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and his mother, Lee Gap-ja, rushed to the garrison of the Third Battalion to say goodbye to Chen Ying. Lee Gap-ja said with tears in her eyes: "Our family is truly reluctant to see you leave. We will never forget you when we see Ki-bong."

Party and government organs and People's Army units in many areas of Korea also sent representatives to the garrisons of the returning Volunteer Army units to see them off. Many Korean People's Army officers and soldiers who fought side by side with the Volunteer Army soldiers on the same front line tightly embraced the Volunteer Army soldiers during the farewell. Major General Kim Chang-duk of a certain unit of the Korean People's Army said to the returning Volunteer Army soldiers: "We guarantee that we will work harder in the future to consolidate and develop the brotherly unity and friendship between us and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, continuously strengthen our combat effectiveness, and strive to defend the victory of the Korean armistice, which was won by the blood and sweat of the Korean and Chinese people, and to achieve the peaceful reunification of our motherland!"

    朝鲜人民依依送别志愿军返国部队
    【新华社平壤十四日电】即将撤离朝鲜返国的中国人民志愿军七个师整装待发；其先头部队的坦克、大炮和步兵，已开始沿着好几条宽阔的公路向车站进发。
    返国部队战士们的心情是激动而愉快。他们在出发之前，细心地擦洗了大炮和各种武器。坦克手们把自己入朝作战以来的歼敌数字写在坦克上，他们说：这是祖国人民交给我们的武器，我们要向祖国人民汇报我们出国执行抗美援朝任务的情形。许多人把朝鲜民主主义人民共和国授予的各种勋章和奖章，祖国人民送给的抗美援朝纪念章整齐地挂在胸前。各部队的战士们都在谈论着怎样问候离别快四年的祖国人民，并对祖国人民的支援表示感谢。
    战士们在离开驻地前去看望了自己耕种的菜地和他们帮助朝鲜人民修建的房舍、水渠和学校，并挨门逐户地向朝鲜人民告别，向朝鲜政府，人民军和继续为保卫朝鲜停战胜利而守卫在阵地上的志愿军部队告别。在告别时，他们和朝鲜人民互赠纪念礼物，感谢朝鲜军民对他们长期真诚的关怀和支援，并预祝他们在争取和平解决朝鲜问题的斗争中取得最后的胜利。他们说：我们为和平而来，也为和平而去，我们将永远关怀和支援朝鲜人民，为保卫国家独立与和平事业而斗争。他们在告别时，也一再勉励留在朝鲜的志愿军部队要继续警惕地守卫阵地，为争取朝鲜问题的和平解决而奋斗到底。
   【新华社平壤十四日电】朝鲜人民怀着难舍的心情，纷纷赶到中国人民志愿军驻地送别返回中国的部队。
    朝鲜“共和国英雄”赵炳述家乡的三百多名妇女，听说附近志愿军部队要返回中国，纷纷跑去抢着为志愿军战士们洗被子和军衣。赵炳述的老母亲吴东烈，也抢着替战士们洗了六件军衣，并且特地用熨斗把军衣熨平，亲自送给战士穿上。她说：
  “走吧，穿着干干净净的衣服回国，你们的中国母亲才喜欢。你们回国以后，就寄信来。”平岩里的一位老军人李信瓒，用汉字写了一首歌颂仁义之师的七言古诗送给志愿军返国部队，他说：“中国人民志愿军在我们祖国遭到侵略时，毅然用生命和鲜血来援助我们，停战后，志愿军又积极帮助我们重建家园，我们子孙万代永远忘不了志愿军的功德。”谷山郡女子中学学生金福华和她的女同学，连夜赶织了一件上有朝文“为和平斗争”五个大字的线背心送给志愿军返国部队。朝鲜妇女们还送给志愿军返国部队许多镶着红绿边的衬领和绣有“朝中亲善”四个字的手帕。被中国人民志愿军某部三营医生陈英从重病中救活的朝鲜儿童李基凤和他的母亲李甲子，赶到三营驻地和陈英话别时，李甲子含着眼泪说：“我们一家人真舍不得你们离开，我们看见基凤就永远忘不了你们。”
    朝鲜许多地区的党、政机关和人民军部队，也纷纷派出代表赶往志愿军返国部队驻地送行。许多和志愿军战士并肩战斗在一个阵地上的朝鲜人民军军官和战士们，在送别时紧紧地拥抱着志愿军战士。朝鲜人民军某部金昌德少将对返国的志愿军战士们说：“我们保证今后更加努力巩固和发展和中国人民志愿军之间兄弟般的团结和友谊，不断加强自己的战斗力，为保卫朝中人民流血流汗换来的朝鲜停战的胜利、争取祖国的和平统一而奋斗到底！”
