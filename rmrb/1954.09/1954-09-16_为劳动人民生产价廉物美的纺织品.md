    Produce Inexpensive and High-Quality Textiles for the Working People
    Zhang Fangzuo, Delegate to the National People's Congress, Deputy Director of the East China Textile Administration Bureau

    The great achievements of New China in industrial construction are manifested not only in heavy industry but also in light industry. The development and changes in the Shanghai textile industry over the past five years are an example.

    I am a technician and have worked in the textile industry for 30 years, 25 of which were in the textile industry of old China. My work area was mainly in Shanghai. I have a deep understanding of the various dark sides and pains that the Shanghai textile industry encountered before liberation. Although the Shanghai textile industry has a history of nearly 60 years, it has never achieved healthy development before liberation. The lifeline of production was long controlled by imperialism and bureaucratic capital. Machinery completely depended on imperialism, and half of the raw materials depended on imperialism. Factories often had to decide how much to operate based on the amount of American cotton imported. Imperialism and bureaucratic capital implemented the superexploitation of the foreman system, cruelly exploiting and persecuting workers. Factory working conditions were extremely poor, with no cooling equipment at all, and the temperature in the factory buildings was often above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Workers toiled like animals all year round and were always under the threat of unemployment. Especially after Japan surrendered and the Kuomintang reactionaries ruled Shanghai, the corruption and darkness of the textile industry reached its peak. Kuomintang reactionary officials were only interested in making a fortune and did not talk about developing production at all. In a few years, bureaucratic enterprises not only did not add a single spindle but also did not maintain the original machinery and equipment, and instead damaged many machines. The operating rate of textile factories was only 60 percent, and workers' lives were not guaranteed. The Shanghai textile industry was on its last breath. This situation caused many people in the textile industry to feel heartbroken.

    When I returned to China from Japan in 1924, I naively imagined how to serve the industrial construction of the motherland, but 25 years of facts told me that under the oppression and rule of imperialism and Kuomintang bureaucratic capital, our country's dream of building an independent and autonomous industry would never come true.

    After the nationwide liberation, with the restoration and development of the national economy, the Shanghai textile industry ended its dark history and embarked on a path of healthy development, showing an unprecedented prosperity. This year, the total output of Shanghai yarn factories has exceeded the highest historical record year by one time. Thanks to the Communist Party and the People's Government's active leadership in production and the improvement of the working class's political awareness and labor enthusiasm, all aspects of the Shanghai textile industry have been renewed. The quality of products has been greatly improved. Before liberation, the product quality of many factories was low, not resistant to washing, easy to fade, and the defective product rate was often above 10 percent. They relied entirely on false decorations and other improper means to deceive users. Now, the Ministry of Textile Industry has formulated strict quality standards for cotton spinning mills, and the first-class product rate of cotton cloth has been increased to more than 98 percent. The physical properties and appearance of cotton yarn have improved year by year.

    The work of reducing costs and practicing thrift has also achieved great results. For example, in the past, the amount of cotton used to make one piece of yarn often required more than 410 jin, but now, on the basis of improving quality and yield rate, it has been reduced by 15 to 20 jin. Sizing the warp is to enhance the strength of the cloth. In the past, it was mostly falsely increased, generally reaching about 28 percent, but now it has been reduced to 8 percent. Moreover, many factories use coarse grain starch instead of wheat flour, saving more than 1.5 million bags of flour every year. In other aspects, in the past few years, 14,344 valuable rationalization proposals from workers in Shanghai state-owned textile factories have been adopted, creating a huge amount of wealth for the country.

    In the past, Shanghai was a sales market for textile machinery from imperialist countries. None of the machines in Shanghai cotton spinning mills were foreign products. After liberation, the People's Government reorganized and organized some of the original mechanical repair factories according to their different conditions, implemented professional division of labor and collaborative production. Now, they can manufacture a large number of complete sets of textile machinery to supply the construction of new textile factories in various places. Shanghai is no longer a market for those foreign textile machinery merchants to sell old goods, but has become an important production base for new Chinese textile machinery.

    In the past five years, with the continuous development of production, Shanghai textile workers have not only turned over politically, but their material and cultural living standards have also been greatly improved. I have personally seen the painful life of Shanghai textile workers before liberation. They worked 12 hours of night work and had to work overtime. They slept in dark and stuffy attics and suffered from mosquitoes and bedbugs. Before liberation, prices rose several times a day, and a month's salary could often only buy a few dou of rice. The pain of having no place to treat illnesses and no one to take care of children is even more indescribable. In the past five years, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government has vigorously improved the working conditions of textile workers. In terms of cooling alone, the state has invested more than 100 billion yuan in Shanghai state-owned cotton spinning mills. Workers' dormitories are constantly being built. In two years, state-owned textile factories alone have built more than 313,000 square meters, and many workers have moved into new houses. The East China Textile Administration Bureau now has two hospitals and one maternity and child health hospital, and the number of beds and delivery beds has been expanded to 939, which is nearly eight times that before liberation. State-owned cotton spinning mills now have 25 nurseries, which can accommodate more than 5,300 babies. There were none of these before liberation.

    Now, the yarn produced by the Shanghai textile industry in one day can be woven into cloth for 1.2 million people to make a new set of clothes each. With the restoration and development of the Shanghai textile industry, the people will get more inexpensive and high-quality cloths from here year by year. Last year, the Shanghai textile industry supplied more than twice as much cotton cloth to various places as in 1950. Due to the continuous reduction of product costs, the price of cotton cloth in the Shanghai textile industry has been gradually reduced in a planned manner. Last year, Shanghai lowered the price of cotton cloth twice on April 1st and October 8th, allowing the people to get more benefits. Calculated based on the price of cloth and rice in Shanghai last October, Shanghai farmers only needed 194 jin of rice to exchange for one bolt of fancy gabardine, while on the same day the year before, it took 219 jin of rice, and on the same day in 1951, it took 223 jin of rice to exchange for it. The varieties and patterns of Shanghai textiles are also constantly being improved. The production volume of twill, gabardine, woolen serge, jean, khaki, poplin, and other cloths is constantly increasing. Last year, the sales and production departments also jointly established a sample selection team. Pattern design personnel went deep into the masses to widely collect various patterns loved by the masses. Last year, a total of 1,182 kinds of printed cloth patterns were selected, such as the Hundred Birds, Peacock Spreading its Tail, and Happy Farm, which were deeply welcomed by farmers. With the continuous development of production, the construction funds accumulated by the Shanghai textile industry for the country have also increased year by year.

    I have been engaged in the textile industry for 30 years, and only in these five years after liberation have I truly felt that time has not been wasted. In the past 25 years, I always felt that I had no place to use my strength, but now I feel that my ability cannot keep up with the development of the cause. Today, the people have given me the great honor of being a delegate to the National People's Congress, which makes me feel excited and ashamed, and also makes me feel the great responsibility I bear. I can only study and work better and contribute all my strength to the country's socialist industrialization.

    为劳动人民生产价廉物美的纺织品
    全国人民代表大会代表  华东纺织管理局副局长  张方佐
    新中国在工业建设方面的巨大成就，不仅表现在重工业方面，也表现在轻工业方面。上海纺织工业五年来的发展和变化就是一个例证。
    我是一个技术人员，在纺织业中工作已有三十年，其中有二十五年是在旧中国的纺织界，工作地区主要是在上海。对于上海纺织工业在解放前所遭遇的种种黑暗和痛苦，我是感受很深的。上海的纺织工业虽然已有近六十年的历史，但在解放前始终没有得到过健康的发展，生产命脉长期被控制在帝国主义和官僚资本手里，机器完全要依赖帝国主义，原料有半数要依赖帝国主义，工厂常常要根据美棉进口的多少来决定开工多少。帝国主义和官僚资本实行了超经济剥削的工头制度，残酷地剥削和迫害工人。工厂劳动条件极坏，根本没有什么降温设备，厂房温度常在华氏一百度以上。工人们整年做牛做马，还随时都有失业的威胁。尤其是日本投降，国民党反动派统治上海以后，纺织业的腐败黑暗更达于极点。国民党反动官员们热衷的只是发横财，根本谈不上发展生产。几年中官僚企业不但未增添一枚锭子，对原有机器设备也不加保养，反而损坏了许多机器。纺织厂开工率仅达百分之六十，工人生活无保障，上海纺织业已是奄奄一息。这种情景，使得很多纺织界的人士感到痛心。
    我在一九二四年从日本回国时，曾天真地设想着如何为祖国的工业建设服务，但二十五年的事实告诉了我：在帝国主义和国民党官僚资本的压迫统治下，我国要想建设独立自主的工业，将永远是梦想。
    全国解放后，随着国民经济的恢复和发展，上海的纺织工业才结束了过去的黑暗历史，走上了健康发展的道路，出现了有史以来空前繁荣兴盛的景象。今年上海纱厂的总产量已超过历史最高记录年度的一倍。由于共产党和人民政府积极的领导生产，工人阶级政治觉悟和劳动积极性的提高，上海纺织工业各方面都已经面貌一新。产品质量大大提高了，解放前，许多工厂的产品质量低，不耐洗，易脱色，次品率常在百分之十以上，全靠虚伪的装璜等不正当手段欺蒙用户。现在，中央纺织工业部对棉纺厂已制定出严格的质量标准，棉布的正品率已提高到百分之九十八以上。棉纱的物理性能和外观状态逐年都有进步。
    降低成本和厉行节约的工作，也收到了极大成效。例如过去制成一件纱的用棉量经常需四百一十斤以上，现在则在提高质量和制成率的基础上，已减少十五斤到二十斤。经纱上浆是为了增强布的强力，过去多是虚伪加重，普遍达百分之二十八左右，现在已降低到百分之八。而且有很多厂以粗粮淀粉代替麦粉，每年节约面粉达一百五十万袋以上。其他如几年来，上海国营纺织厂工人有一万四千三百四十四件有价值的合理化建议被采纳，为国家创造了巨量财富。
    过去，上海是帝国主义国家纺织机器的推销市场，上海棉纺厂的机器没有一部不是外国的商品，解放后，人民政府把原有的一些机械修配工厂，根据它们的不同条件加以整顿组织，实行专业分工和协作生产，现在已能大量制造整套的纺织机器，供给各地建设新的纺织工厂。上海再也不是那些外国纺织机器商人兜售旧货的市场，而已成了新中国纺织机器的重要产地了。
    五年来，随着生产的不断发展，上海纺织工人不但在政治上翻了身，他们的物质、文化生活水平也大大提高了。解放前上海纺织工人的痛苦生活我是亲眼看见的。他们做了十二小时夜工，还要加班加点，回家睡在暗闷的搁楼上，又饱受蚊子臭虫之苦。解放前，物价一日数涨，一个月的工资往往只能买到几斗米。有病无处治，孩子无人照管等痛苦，更是说不尽。五年来，上海市人民政府大力改善纺织工人的劳动条件，单降温一项，国家在上海国营棉纺厂共已投资一千亿元以上。工人宿舍不断在建筑，二年中仅国营纺织厂就造了三十一万三千多平方公尺，许多工人都迁入了新的住宅。华东纺织管理局现在有医院二所，妇幼保健院一所，病床和产床已扩充到九百三十九张，为解放前的八倍弱，国营棉纺厂现有托儿所二十五个，可收托婴儿五千三百多人，这在解放前是一个也没有的。
    现在，上海纺织工业一天所生产的纱，就可以织成供一百二十万人各做一套新衣的布。随着上海纺织工业的恢复和发展，人民将一年比一年更多地从这里得到价廉物美的布疋。去年上海纺织工业供应各地的棉布，比一九五○年增加一倍以上。由于产品成本的不断降低，上海纺织工业的棉布价格有计划地逐渐调低，去年四月一日和十月八日，上海就曾二次调低棉布价格，使人民得到更多好处。以去年十月上海布、米牌价计算，上海农民只要一百九十四斤大米就能换到一疋花哔叽，而前年同日则需二百十九斤大米，一九五一年同日更需要二百二十三斤大米才能换到。上海纺织品的品种和花式现在也正在不断改进，斜纹、哔叽、华达呢、直贡呢、卡其、府绸等布的生产量在不断增加。去年销售和生产部门还联合成立了选样小组，绘样设计人员深入群众广泛搜集各种为群众喜爱的花式，去年
  一年共评选出一千一百八十二种花布图案，其中如百鸟图、孔雀开屏、农家乐等花布，深受农民的欢迎。随着生产事业的不断发展，上海纺织工业为国家积累的建设资金也一年年增加了。
    我从事纺织事业三十年，只有在这解放后的五年中，才真正感到时光没有虚度。过去二十五年中自己总感到有力无处用，而现在则感到：自己的能力跟不上事业的发展。今天，人民又给了我全国人民代表大会代表的莫大荣誉，这使我感到兴奋和惭愧，也更感到自己责任的重大，我唯有更好地学习和工作，为国家社会主义工业化事业供献出我的一切力量。
