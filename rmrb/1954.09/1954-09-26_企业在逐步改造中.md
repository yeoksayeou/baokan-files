    Enterprises Are Gradually Being Transformed
    Guo Dihuo, Representative of the National People's Congress, Deputy General Manager of Shanghai Wing On Textile Printing and Dyeing Company

    The Shanghai Wing On Textile Printing and Dyeing Company was established in 1921. It currently has over 11,000 workers and staff, with four spinning mills including two weaving departments, one printing and dyeing factory, and one machine factory. In the early days after liberation, due to the long-term oppression and devastation by imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucrat-capitalism, coupled with the backwardness of the enterprise's own management methods, the enterprise experienced a difficult period. Especially in early 1950, it had to reduce work to only four shifts per week, and gradually fell into a state of monthly losses. However, thanks to the timely implementation of expanded commissioned spinning and weaving by the government and the state-owned economy to support our production, and with the joint efforts of both public and private sectors and labor and capital, the temporary difficulties faced by the enterprise in the early days of liberation were quickly overcome. By early 1951, with the implementation of unified purchase and sale methods by the State-owned Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company, all our finished products were brought into the scope of the national plan, enabling our production and operation to gradually overcome blindness and embark on the path of state capitalism. Our production also recovered and improved, and then production increased year by year, and profits increased year by year, showing a new atmosphere unprecedented in decades.

    Over the past five years, our operating shifts, spindle count, and labor productivity have continuously improved, and the production of yarn and cloth has also increased significantly. If the total production in 1949 is taken as 100, cotton yarn in 1953 was 238, and cotton cloth was 268. Comparing the first half of this year with the same period last year, cotton yarn increased by 17.05%, and cotton cloth increased by 3.67%. The output of printed and dyed fabrics has increased even faster in the past five years. If the average monthly output from June 1949 to November 1950, i.e., the early days of liberation, is taken as 100, the average from January to June of this year has increased to over 746.

    With the development of production, the financial situation has also improved year by year. In the past five years, the state has adjusted and increased processing fees and purchase prices three times to take care of our legitimate profits. On the cost side, it began to decline after the expansion of accepting state processing tasks in the summer of 1950. Therefore, since the fiscal year of 1950, our enterprise's profits have shown a trend of increasing year by year. If the profit figure for 1950 is taken as 100, it was 222 in 1951, 345 in 1952, 596 in 1953, and 305 in the first half of this year alone.

    Due to continuous progress in production, we have the conditions to engage in improving equipment and increasing labor protection and welfare facilities. In terms of improving equipment, in addition to a batch of new "Rieter-type" spindles brought back to China that have already been installed and put into production, the main focus has been on expanding and improving electrical equipment, adding and modifying some textile printing and dyeing equipment, strengthening workshop safety devices and fire-fighting equipment, and completing deep well water air washing and cooling equipment in various factories. In terms of labor protection and welfare, under the guidance of the government or through labor-capital consultation, there have also been some improvements in the past five years. Such as, in coordination with the implementation of labor insurance, the health rooms of various factories have been strengthened, nutrition canteens, rest rooms and sanatoriums have been established; nurseries, canteens and bathrooms have been expanded; in addition, three new children's schools and a new-style dormitory accommodating 1,000 people and a temporary dormitory accommodating 400 people have been built.

    Starting from this year, our enterprise and the Shanghai Shenxin Textile Factory have decided to use funds accumulated within the two enterprises to apply for public leadership and build a large-scale joint public-private textile printing and dyeing factory in the inland area in order to support the general task of the state during the transition period with practical actions. This plan has been approved by the government, and under the direct leadership of the East China Textile Administration Bureau and the strong support of relevant provincial authorities, a preparatory office organization has been established. A large number of personnel from the two enterprises are now being transferred to actively carry out various preparatory tasks under the leadership of the public sector.

    Although our production and various facilities have achieved the above-mentioned achievements in the past five years, there are still many shortcomings.

    The main current shortcomings in production are that we cannot yet complete the state's processing and unified purchase tasks well in terms of quality, on time, and in quantity. Waste is still serious. Although we have paid attention to improving cotton consumption in various factories over the years, except for individual factories, the standard of 395 catties has not yet been universally achieved, and the cotton consumption of high-count yarn is often above the national standard.

    Under the brilliant illumination of the general task of the state during the transition period, we further realize that the leadership and support of the state-owned economy and the continuous improvement of the production enthusiasm of the working class are the decisive factors for us to achieve some success. This is inseparable from the fact that our enterprise embarked on the intermediate form of state capitalism earlier. It is precisely because we have embarked on the process of gradual transformation that the negative effects that are unfavorable to the national economy and the people's livelihood have been gradually restricted. Our enterprise has the conditions to be used by the state to serve the national economy and the people's livelihood, and the enterprise itself can obtain the above-mentioned progress and development. This is the concrete manifestation of the superiority of state capitalism.

    At the same time, we also realize that although we have made these progress in the past five years, we still have many shortcomings in terms of obeying the state's planned production, improving quality, reducing costs, and accumulating funds, and we are far behind the state-owned and joint public-private enterprises in the same industry. This clearly points out the direction of our future efforts.

    企业在逐步改造中
    全国人民代表大会代表 上海永安纺织印染公司副总经理  郭棣活
    上海永安纺织印染公司设立于一九二一年。现有工人职员一万一千余人，所属四个纺纱厂包括两个织布部门，一个印染厂和一个机器厂。解放初期，由于过去长期遭受帝国主义、封建势力和官僚资本的压迫、摧残，并因企业本身经营管理方式的落后，企业曾经有过一段困难时期，特别是在一九五○年初，曾不得不减工至每周只开四班，而逐月陷于亏损局面。但经政府和国营经济及时实行扩大代纺代织，扶助我们的生产，在公私劳资共同努力之下，很快克服了企业在解放初期的暂时困难。至一九五一年初，更因国营花纱布公司实行统一购销办法，使我们的成品全部纳入国家计划范围，使我们的生产经营逐步克服了盲目性，走上了国家资本主义的轨道。我们的生产也由恢复到好转，进而生产年年上升，盈余年年增加，出现了几十年所未有的新气象。
    五年来我们的开工班数、锭台数和劳动生产率不断提高，纱布生产量也显著增加。如以一九四九年总生产量为一百，一九五三年棉纱为二百三十八，棉布为二百六十八。至本年上半年度与去年同期比较棉纱增加百分之十七点○五，棉布增加百分之三点六七。印染色布的产量五年来增加更快，如以解放初期即一九四九年六月至一九五○年十一月的每月平均产量作为一百，本年一至六月份平均已增达七百四十六以上。
    随着生产的发展，财务情况也逐年好转。五年来国家为了照顾我们的合法利润，曾三度调升工缴费和收购价格。成本方面则自一九五○年夏扩大接受国家加工任务后，开始下降。因此，我们的企业自一九五○年度起盈余呈现逐年递增的趋势。如以一九五○年盈余数为一百，一九五一年为二百二十二，一九五二年为三百四十五，一九五三年为五百九十六，本年单只上半年度即达三百零五。
    由于生产不断进步，使得我们有条件可以从事改善设备和增加劳保福利的设施。改善设备方面，除运回国“立达式”新纱锭一批早已装就投入生产外，主要是扩充和改良了电气设备，添置和改装了一部分纺织印染设备，加强了车间安全装置和消防设备、完成了各厂深井水空气洗涤降温设备。劳保福利方面，五年来在政府的指导下或通过劳资协商，也有了一些增进。如配合劳动保险的实施，加强了各厂的保健室，设立了营养食堂、休养室和疗养所；扩建了托儿所、食堂和浴室；此外，又新建了三所子弟学校和一所容纳一千人的新式宿舍和一所容纳四百人的临时宿舍等等。
    本年度起我们的企业和上海申新纺织厂为了以实际行动拥护国家过渡时期总任务，决定从两个企业内部积累资金，申请公方领导，在内地筹建公私合营的大型纺织印染厂一所。此项计划业已得到政府批准，并在华东纺织管理局的直接领导和有关省当局的大力支持下，成立了筹备处的组织。现正调集两个企业的大批人员，在公方领导下，积极进行各项筹备工作。
    五年来我们的生产各项设施虽然获得上述的一些成绩，但却仍有很多缺点。
    生产上当前的主要缺点是还不能很好地按质、按时、按量完成国家加工统购任务。浪费现象仍然严重。我们各厂用棉量年来虽曾多方注意改进，但除个别厂外，仍未普遍达到三百九十五斤的标准，高支纱的用棉量更经常在国家标准之上。
    在国家过渡时期总任务的光辉照耀下，我们进一步体会到国营经济的领导扶助，工人阶级生产积极性的不断提高，是我们所以能够获得一些成绩的决定因素，这和我们的企业较早地走上国家资本主义中级形式是分不开的。正因为我们走上逐步改造的过程，不利于国计民生的消极作用逐步受到限制，我们的企业才有条件被国家利用为国计民生服务，企业本身也才能够获得上述的一些进步和发展，这正是国家资本主义优越性的具体表现。
    同时我们也体会到，五年来虽然有了这些进步，但在服从国家计划生产，提高质量，降低成本，积累资金等方面，我们还有很多缺点存在，更远落于国营和公私合营的同业之后，这清楚地指明我们今后努力的方向。
