Agricultural Technology Extension Stations in Inner Mongolia Play a Significant Role

    Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has newly established 123 agricultural technology extension stations (groups) this year. Including the original stations (groups), there are now more than 170 stations (groups). When promoting technology, each extension station first understands local soil, climate, and mutual aid and cooperation conditions to determine the content of guidance. This has played a significant role in improving technology and increasing yields. This year, the stations in the eastern region continued to promote the experience of Zhaoyuan's high yields, going deep into the fields according to the seasons to guide farmers in reforming old farm tools, planting early at the right time, thinning seedlings to protect them, applying fertilizer, and preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests. Therefore, this year, most of the farmland in the Jirem League and other regions achieved two hoeings and two harrowings, and most agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid teams achieved three hoeings and three harrowings. At present, autumn crops such as soybeans, corn, and sorghum are growing well and are expected to have a good harvest. In the wheat-producing areas of the western region, under the unified leadership of the local Party and government, the experience of high wheat yields through "sparse sowing and dense planting, deep plowing and shallow irrigation, and reasonable fertilization" was promoted. This year, the area of wheat sparsely sown and densely planted in the entire Hetao Administrative Region accounted for 74% of the total wheat area of more than 1.2 million mu. These densely planted wheat crops generally yielded bumper harvests. In Hangjinhou Banner, the average wheat yield per mu increased by 36 jin compared to last year. Some agricultural production cooperatives harvested a high yield of 640 jin of wheat per mu. (Zhang Zhi)

    内蒙古各地农业技术推广站发挥显著作用
    内蒙古自治区今年新建立了一百二十三个农业技术推广站（组）。连原有站（组）在内，共已有一百七十多个站（组）。各推广站在推广技术时，首先了解当地土质、气候及互助合作等条件，确定指导内容，对改进技术、提高产量，起了很大作用。今年东部地区各站继续推广了肇源丰产的经验，按季节深入田间，指导农民改革旧农具、适时早种、间苗保苗、施肥及防治病虫害等技术，因此，今年哲里木盟等地区绝大部分农田作到了两铲两趟，大部分农业合作社和互助组达到了三铲三趟。目前大豆、玉米、高粱等秋季作物都生长良好，可望丰收。西部产麦区各站在当地党、政统一领导下，推广了小麦“疏播密植、深耕浅浇、合理施肥”的丰产经验，今年全河套行政区小麦疏播密植面积，占一百二十多万亩小麦总面积百分之七十四。这些密植的小麦普遍获得丰收，杭锦后旗每亩小麦平均比去年增产三十六斤。有的农业生产合作社小麦每亩收六百四十斤高额产量。（张智）
