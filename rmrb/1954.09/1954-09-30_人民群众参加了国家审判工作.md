    The People Participate in National Judicial Work
    Lin Xin
    The people are the masters of our country. All power in the state belongs to the people. The people solemnly elected the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels to manage state affairs, and they also elected people's assessors to participate in the judicial work of the people's courts, implementing the system of people's assessors. The establishment of this judicial democratic system gives the people more opportunities to participate in and supervise national judicial work, and also enables the people's courts to better serve the people and protect the interests of the state and the people. We express our warm support and welcome to the implementation of this judicial democratic system.
    The people's courts of Beijing City and its districts have implemented the system of people's assessors in the trial of cases. During the meetings of the People's Congresses in various districts, the People's Congresses of Xidan and Xuanwu districts, and some township People's Congresses of Nanyuan and Dongjiao districts, have elected people's assessors according to their respective areas. Other districts have also elected people's assessors through people's organizations. The people's courts in Xidan and Xuanwu districts have also implemented a system where people's assessors take turns performing their duties at the courts. Every week, a certain number of people's assessors are on duty at the people's courts, and every day, people's assessors participate in the trial of cases. The Beijing Municipal People's Court and the people's courts of other districts, except for certain types of cases such as simple and minor cases, generally have people's assessors participate in the trial of criminal and civil cases, and they have equal power with the judges.
    The people's courts create all conditions to facilitate the people's assessors in exercising their democratic powers. They not only stand on an equal footing with the people's assessors to try cases, but also regularly hold study sessions and forums with the people's assessors, or invite the people's assessors to observe the trials of typical cases, helping the people's assessors in all aspects to improve their political thinking and judicial professional level, so that the people's assessors can play a greater role in judicial work and do a good job in people's assessment work. People's assessor Han Suyun said: "In the past, under the Kuomintang reactionaries' courts, we didn't even dare to enter the door; now, going to the people's court is as warm as returning to our own family, and we even interrogate cases together with the judges. This is truly called the people being the masters of their own affairs."
    After being elected by the masses, the people's assessors also cherish their democratic powers. They and the judges handle cases with a spirit of impartiality and responsibility, which has been highly praised by the masses. In May of this year, the Shijingshan District People's Court accepted a divorce case where the plaintiff, a man, was forced into marriage by his parents with the defendant when he was sixteen years old. The woman was three years older than the man. The couple's relationship had been bad for a long time after the marriage. In the twelve years since their marriage, the couple had not said a single heartfelt word to each other; they were as indifferent to each other as strangers, with neither paying attention to the other. This case was co-tried by people's assessors Li Guizhen and Chu Zhihong. Li Guizhen asked the neighbors of the parties to understand the situation. She was afraid that going during the day would delay people's production, so she went at night when everyone was free and enjoying the cool air, chatting from eight o'clock in the evening until eleven o'clock before returning home to rest. The second time, she also asked the defendant, the woman, to understand the situation, and clarified the bottom line. Regarding this case, the judges and assessors unanimously agreed that a divorce was necessary. Because not divorcing would not only deprive the couple of happiness, but also affect production. However, dealing with this case encountered a difficult problem: the woman threatened to commit suicide as soon as divorce was mentioned, saying that she would "enter in a sedan chair and leave in a coffin," and resolutely refused to divorce. When people's assessor Li Guizhen discussed the case with the judge, she objectively analyzed the contradictions in the defendant's thinking and proposed a method to resolve these contradictions. She believed that: on the one hand, the woman might agree to divorce because the relationship between the couple was bad and she was in great mental pain; but on the other hand, she also had serious feudal conservative ideas, which made her lack the courage to agree to a divorce. Li Guizhen said: "As long as we educate the defendant woman very well, break her feudal ideas, and point out a bright future for her, she can agree to a divorce and will not commit suicide." The judge and another assessor, Chu Zhihong, believed that Li Guizhen's analysis and working methods were correct, so they began to work separately. The comrades of the court went to the parties' residence to understand the situation of their family property and study how to take care of the woman's life after the divorce; Li Guizhen voluntarily undertook the work of ideological mobilization for the woman. She patiently explained to the defendant woman the harm of feudal toxins to people and explained that the motherland was carrying out socialist construction and that everyone had a bright and beautiful future. When the neighbors of the parties saw that the assessor they had elected was so enthusiastically solving problems for the people, they were very happy and took the initiative to help get through the woman's thinking. After in-depth ideological education, the woman finally understood the truth and agreed to the divorce. The woman was deeply moved by the assessor's enthusiastic and patient work style. With a moved heart, she kindly held Li Guizhen's hand and said: "The people elected you as a representative to the district People's Congress and as a people's assessor, it was truly a correct choice!" When both parties went to the court to complete the procedures, the judge and the people's assessor carefully reviewed the handling of their family property and living arrangements after the divorce before jointly signing the mediation statement and issuing it to both parties. Later, Li Guizhen often inquired about the woman's life after the divorce. The masses told her: "Very good, smiling, and much fatter." Only then did she feel relieved. Soon, the woman remarried and organized a loving and harmonious happy family. The plaintiff, the man, worked and studied even harder in the factory. The people said: "The people's government has truly done good things for the people."
    People's assessors come from the masses and maintain close ties with the masses. With their participation in the assessment of cases, the level of people's judicial work has been strengthened and improved. The Fengtai District People's Court once accepted a case in which a mother-in-law accused her son-in-law, Hou Yonglu, of abusing her daughter, Shan Shuqin. In court, the man did not admit to abusing his wife, and the woman did not say that her husband had abused her. Li Zonghe, the people's assessor who participated in the trial of this case, held a forum with members of the agricultural production cooperative to listen to the reflections of the masses, and quickly clarified the facts of the case. The one who abused Shan Shuqin was her father-in-law, Hou Deshan, not her husband, Hou Yonglu. Hou Deshan not only consistently tortured his daughter-in-law, but also provoked the feelings between them and incited Hou Yonglu to beat Shan Shuqin. Hou Yonglu beat his wife in order to obey his father's orders. After hitting her, he comforted her, and she also believed that the relationship between the couple was very good, so she refused to state the facts in court. After clarifying these situations, the court punished Hou Deshan according to the law and educated Hou Yonglu.
    The above facts show that in our country where the people are the masters, the people's assessment system is built on a truly democratic foundation. The people's assessors also realize that it is a great honor and a great responsibility to represent the people in participating in national judicial work, and they should serve the people wholeheartedly. Xu Fazeng, a worker in the Jingxi mining area, said with emotion after being elected as a people's assessor: "Who used to look up to the 'black coal' who carried coal for half his life; now, I have gloriously become a people's assessor, and I must do a good job in judicial work."

    人民群众参加了国家审判工作
    林馨
    人民是我们国家的主人。国家的一切权力属于人民。人民庄严地选举了全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会，管理国家大事，也选举了人民陪审员，参加了人民法院的审判工作，实行了人民陪审员制度。这一司法民主制度的建立，使人民有更多的机会参加和监督国家审判工作，也使人民法院能够更好地为人民服务，保护国家和人民的利益。我们对这一司法民主制度的实行，表示热烈的拥护和欢迎。
    北京市市、区人民法院在审判案件时已实行了人民陪审员制度。在各区召开人民代表大会会议时，西单和宣武两个区的人民代表大会和南苑、东郊两个区的一部分乡人民代表大会，已按地区选举了人民陪审员，其他区也由人民团体选出人民陪审员。西单、宣武两个区的人民法院还实行了人民陪审员轮流到法院执行职务，每星期都有一定数量的人民陪审员在人民法院执行职务，每天有人民陪审员参加案件的审判。北京市人民法院和其他各区人民法院，除几种案件如简易轻微的案件等外，一般的刑事、民事案件都由人民陪审员参加审判，他们和审判员有同等的权力。
    人民法院创造一切条件，便于人民陪审员执行其民主权力。他们不仅和人民陪审员站在同等的地位来审判案件，而且定期和人民陪审员一起举行学习会、座谈会，或者邀请人民陪审员观摩典型案件的审判，从各方面帮助人民陪审员提高政策思想和审判业务水平，使人民陪审员能够在审判工作中发挥更大的作用，做好人民陪审工作。人民陪审员韩素云说：“过去国民党反动派的法院，我们连门也不敢进；现在到人民法院就像回娘家一样的亲热，并且还同审判员一道问案子，这真正叫人民当家作主。”
    人民陪审员在被群众选出后，也都十分珍视自己的民主权力。他们和审判员一起，本着大公无私和认真负责的精神处理案件，受到了群众的极大称赞。石景山区人民法院今年五月受理了一件离婚案，原告男的在十六岁时由父母包办和被告结婚，女的比男的大三岁。婚后夫妇感情长期不好，结婚到现在十二年间，夫妇两人没有说过一句知心话；彼此就像路人一样的冷淡，谁也不理谁。这个案子由人民陪审员李桂珍和褚志宏参加陪审。李桂珍找当事人的邻居了解情况。她怕白天去耽误人家的生产，就在晚上趁大家空闲纳凉的时候去，一直从晚上八点聊到十一点才回家休息。第二次又找被告女方了解了一下，摸清了底子。对于这个案子，审判员和陪审员的意见一致：认为必须离婚。因为不离婚，不但他们夫妇生活没有幸福，而且也影响生产。但要处理这个案件，却碰上一个困难问题：女方一提离婚就要寻死，说是要“坐着轿子进来，躺着棺材出去”，坚决不肯离婚。人民陪审员李桂珍和审判员研究案情时，很客观地分析了被告女方思想上的矛盾，并提出解决这种矛盾的方法。她认为：女方一方面有可能同意离婚，原因是他们夫妇之间的感情不好，精神极痛苦；但另一方面，又有严重的封建保守思想，这就使她没有同意离婚的勇气。李桂珍说：“只要我们很好地对被告女方进行思想教育，打破她的封建思想，并给她指出光明的前途，她是可以同意离婚的，也不会去寻死。”审判员和另一个陪审员褚志宏认为李桂珍的分析和工作方法是对的，他们便分头进行工作。法院的同志到当事人的住所了解他们家庭财产情况，研究离婚后如何照顾女方生活的问题；李桂珍自愿承担了对女方进行思想动员的工作。她十分耐心地给被告女方解释了封建遗毒对人们的害处，说明了祖国正在进行社会主义建设，每个人都有光明美丽的前途。当事人的邻居看见自己选举的陪审员这样热心地为人民解决问题，十分高兴，也主动帮助打通女方的思想。经过深入的思想教育，女方终于明白了道理，同意了离婚。女方深深地为陪审员的热诚耐心的工作作风所感动，她怀着感动的心情，亲切地握着李桂珍的手说：“人民选举你当区人民代表大会代表和人民陪审员，真是没有选错啊！”在双方当事人到法院办手续时，审判员和人民陪审员又对他们离婚后家庭财产的处理和生活照顾等问题做了仔细的审查，才共同在调解书上署了名，发给男女双方当事人。以后，李桂珍还时常打听女方离婚后的生活情况。群众对她说：“挺好，喜笑颜开，也胖了许多。”她这才放下心来。不久，女方重新结了婚，组织了一个友爱和睦的幸福家庭。原告男方在工厂里工作、学习也加倍有劲。人民群众说：“人民政府真为人民办了好事。”
    人民陪审员来自群众，和群众保持着紧密的联系，有他们参加案件的陪审，更加加强和提高了人民审判工作水平。丰台区人民法院曾经受理一件岳母控告女婿侯永禄虐待她女儿单淑琴的案子。在法庭上，男方不承认虐待过他妻子，女方也不说她丈夫有虐待行为。参加这个案件审判的人民陪审员李宗和，在农业生产合作社找社员们开了一个座谈会，听取了群众的反映，很快就把案情弄清楚了。虐待单淑琴的是她公公侯德山，不是她的丈夫侯永禄。侯德山不但一贯地折磨儿媳妇，而且挑拨他们夫妇之间的感情，教唆侯永禄打单淑琴。侯永禄为了听从父命，也打了妻子。打后又安慰她，而她也认为夫妇之间的感情很好，所以在法庭上都不肯陈述事实。法庭在弄清这些情况后，依法惩办了侯德山，并教育了侯永禄。
    上述事实说明：在我们人民当家作主的国家里，人民陪审制是建立在真正民主的基础上的。而人民陪审员也认识到代表人民参加国家审判工作是非常光荣的事情，而且也是一种重大的责任，应该全心全意地为人民办事。京西矿区的工人许法增在当选为人民陪审员后，感动地说：“背了半辈子煤的‘黑煤子’，过去谁瞧得起；现在，我光荣地做了人民陪审员，我一定要把审判工作做好。”
