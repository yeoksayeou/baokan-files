    A Criticism That Received Good Results

    In May and June, the *New Hunan Daily* published serious criticisms and continuous reports on the capitalist management ideology of the local state-owned Shaoyang Paper Mill, which was solely pursuing profits, focusing only on the quantity of products and neglecting product quality. This criticism achieved good results. Not only were the workers and staff of the Shaoyang Paper Mill deeply educated, but the entire factory, from top to bottom, thoroughly examined and criticized the erroneous thinking of blindly pursuing output and neglecting quality, and took specific measures to improve product quality. Many other factories and mines also linked this event to criticize capitalist management ideology, further clarifying the direction and tasks of local state-owned industries. Bin County Printing Factory, Shaoyang Heping Pen Factory, and others also held product quality exhibitions, using the vivid facts of their own factories to educate workers on the importance of product quality.

    The *New Hunan Daily* recently summarized the experience of this criticism. The summary pointed out that the reason why this criticism achieved good results was because it was accurate and stable, that is, it was based on facts. And the reason why it could be accurate and stable was because in March of this year, the editorial department, in conjunction with the provincial conference of local state-owned small factories and mines, studied the Party's guidelines and policies on local state-owned industries and learned that capitalist management ideology and poor product quality were common problems in local state-owned industries in Hunan Province. Therefore, when the editorial department received a letter from a reader exposing the capitalist management ideology and inferior products of the Shaoyang Paper Mill, it launched a criticism in the newspaper with this event as the center. Before publishing the criticism, the newspaper also conducted in-depth and detailed investigations and research, thus ensuring the truthfulness of the facts and the appropriateness of the degree of this criticism. At the same time, in carrying out the criticism, the newspaper also adopted a responsible attitude, neither exaggerating the mistakes of those being criticized, nor indiscriminately labeling them, but rather presenting the problems based on facts, and reporting and encouraging them when the product quality of the Shaoyang Paper Mill improved. This made the criticism more practical, prompting those being criticized to overcome their shortcomings and mistakes faster and better, and gaining the support of the leading organs. The fact is also that since the newspaper published the criticism, the product quality of the Shaoyang Paper Mill has significantly improved and has begun to be welcomed by some users.

    The experience of the *New Hunan Daily* in carrying out this criticism shows that it is not only necessary, but also possible, for the criticism in the newspaper to be completely correct. Only when it is completely correct can the criticism in the newspaper play a huge role and achieve good results. (Wei Li)

    一次收到良好效果的批评
    新湖南报在五、六月间对地方国营邵阳造纸厂单纯追求利润、只顾产品数量忽视产品质量的资本主义经营思想提出了严肃的批评，并进行了连续的报道。这次批评收到了较好的效果。不仅邵阳造纸厂职工受到了深刻的教育，全厂从上到下深入地检查批判了盲目追求产量忽视质量的错误思想，采取具体措施改进了产品质量；就是其他许多厂矿也联系这一事件批判了资本主义经营思想，进一步明确了地方国营工业的方针和任务。彬县印刷厂、邵阳和平钢笔厂等还举办了产品质量展览会，用本厂活生生的事实对职工进行了重视产品质量的教育。
    新湖南报最近总结了这次批评的经验。总结指出，这次批评所以能收到较好的效果，是因为做到了准和稳，也就是做到了实事求是。而所以能做到准和稳，又是因为编辑部在今年三月间，结合全省地方国营小厂矿会议，学习了党关于地方国营工业的方针政策，了解到资本主义经营思想和产品质量差，是目前湖南省地方国营工业中普遍存在的问题。因此当编辑部接到读者揭发邵阳造纸厂资本主义经营思想和产品低劣的来信后，便以这个事件为中心在报纸上展开批判。报纸在提出批评前，又进行了深入细致的调查研究，因而保证了这次批评事实的真实和分寸的适当。同时在开展批评中，报纸还采取了负责的态度，既没有夸大被批评者的错误，也不是不加分析地扣大帽子，而是实事求是地提出问题，并且当邵阳造纸厂的产品质量一有改进时就作了报道，加以鼓励。这样就使批评能够切合实际，推动被批评者更快更好地克服缺点和错误，取得领导机关的支持。事实也正是这样，自报纸提出批评后，邵阳造纸厂的产品质量已有显著提高，并开始受到了一些用户的欢迎。
    新湖南报这次开展批评的经验，说明了报纸上的批评要做到完全正确不仅是应该的，而且是可能的。也只有做到完全正确，报纸上的批评才能发挥巨大的作用和取得良好的效果。　　　　（伟立）
