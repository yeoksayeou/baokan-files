Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 23rd: According to TASS, Moscow, September 23rd, Academician D.V. Skobeltsyn, Chairman of the Committee for International Stalin Prizes "For Strengthening Peace Among Nations," presented the Stalin International Peace Prize "For Strengthening Peace Among Nations" to the renowned British scientist and peace activist Professor John Desmond Bernal on September 23rd in the Sverdlov Hall of the Kremlin. Many representatives of the Soviet public attended the ceremony.

Academician Skobeltsyn paid tribute to Bernal in his speech. He said: Professor Bernal combines outstanding achievements in science with extensive public activities, and has consistently stood at the forefront of the international peace movement. Today, Bernal stands again among those who are fighting against German remilitarization and for strengthening mutual understanding between the peoples of Britain, the Soviet Union and other countries.

Subsequently, representatives of various Soviet public organizations congratulated Bernal.

Professor Bernal delivered a reply speech. He was warmly welcomed by those present.

Bernal spoke of his gratitude upon receiving the prize. He pointed out that the peace movement has achieved remarkable victories in recent years. He added that the struggle for peace cannot be relaxed until life is free from the shadow of the fear of war. In the atomic age, mankind can no longer live in hostility, and friendly cooperation has become a condition for continued survival. Although some governments have not yet recognized this fact, it has begun to be understood by the people. The use of atomic energy for destruction is absolutely impermissible. Precisely for this reason, maintaining peace is our most urgent task. Everyone must contribute to this task in their own way. Bernal hailed the Soviet Union's initiative in applying atomic energy to civilian use. He spoke of the magnificent prospects opened up by the use of atomic energy for peaceful development. Bernal concluded by expressing his hope that he could use the prize money to promote international scientific cooperation in the service of peace.

    著名的英国科学家和争取和平的积极工作者
    贝尔纳在莫斯科接受斯大林国际和平奖金
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十三日讯：“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金委员会主席德·斯科贝尔琴院士九月二十三日在克里姆林宫斯维德洛夫大厅把“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金授予著名的英国科学家和争取和平的积极工作者约翰·贝尔纳教授。许多苏联公众代表都参加了这个仪式。
    斯科贝尔琴院士在致词中向贝尔纳表示敬意。他说：贝尔纳教授把科学方面的杰出成就和广泛的公众活动结合起来了，并一贯站在国际和平运动的前列。今天，贝尔纳又站在那些为反对德国重新军国主义化、为加强英国、苏联和其他国家人民间的互相谅解而斗争的人们的行列中。
    接着，苏联各公众团体的代表向贝尔纳祝贺。
    贝尔纳教授致答词。他受到与会者的热烈欢迎。
    贝尔纳谈到了他在接受奖金时的感激的心情。他指出最近几年来和平运动已取得了显著胜利。他又说，但是，在生活还没有摆脱战争恐惧的阴影以前，争取和平的斗争不能放松。在原子时代，人类再也不能互相敌对地生活，友好合作已经成为继续生存的条件。这个事实虽然某些政府还没有认识到，却已经开始为人民所了解了。把原子能用于毁灭是绝对不能允许的。正因为如此，维护和平成为我们当前最迫切的任务。每一个人必须以自己的方式为这个任务贡献力量。贝尔纳欢呼苏联在把原子能应用到民用方面的创举。他谈到原子能的使用为和平发展打开的壮丽前景。贝尔纳最后表示，他希望能够把奖金用来促进国际间为和平而服务的科学的合作。
