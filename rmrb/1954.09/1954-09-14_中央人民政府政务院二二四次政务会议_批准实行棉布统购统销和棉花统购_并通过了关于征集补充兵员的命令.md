Xinhua News Agency, 13th: The 224th Political Affairs Meeting of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council was held on the morning of the 9th. The meeting listened to and approved the report made by Zeng Shan, Deputy Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council and Minister of Commerce of the Central People's Government, on "Preparing to Implement Planned Purchase and Planned Supply of Cotton Cloth and Planned Purchase of Cotton," and adopted the "Order on Implementing Planned Purchase and Planned Supply of Cotton Cloth" and the "Order on Implementing Planned Purchase of Cotton."

In his report, Zeng Shan explained the material basis and necessity for implementing planned purchase and planned supply of cotton cloth and planned purchase of cotton from the perspective of the recovery and development of cotton, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth production over the past five years and the increasing amount of cloth used by the people year by year. He said that in the past five years, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, thanks to the enthusiasm for production displayed by the broad masses of peasants after the land reform, the total cotton output in our country has exceeded the highest production level before the War of Resistance Against Japan (1936) year after year since 1951. If the total cotton output of the country in 1936 is counted as 100, then it was 123 in 1951, 152 in 1952, and 139 in 1953. There has also been great development in the production of cotton yarn and cotton cloth. By the end of this year, the total number of spindles put into production will increase by 22.3 percent compared to the total number of spindles capable of production at the time of national liberation, and the number of looms (excluding those in cotton weaving factories and dyeing factories) will increase by 26.5 percent. The increase in textiles has greatly exceeded the increase in equipment.

He said: With the increase in cotton production and the recovery and development of the textile industry throughout the country, and the continuous improvement of the people's purchasing power, the average per capita annual consumption of machine-woven cotton cloth by the people of the whole country has increased year by year. In 1950, the national average consumption of machine-woven cloth was 11.99 Chinese feet per person, which increased to 23.08 Chinese feet in 1953, not including the consumption of homespun cloth. From the statistical analysis of the cloth supplied to the market, the annual growth is as follows: an increase of 33.47 percent in 1951 compared to 1950; an increase of 17.18 percent in 1952 compared to 1951; and an increase of 47.8 percent in 1953 compared to 1952.

Based on the above production and consumption situation, Zeng Shan pointed out: Due to the state's investment of a large amount of capital in economic construction and cultural construction, the number of employed people has increased, and the total amount of social wages has increased. At the same time, agricultural production has increased, and the purchase price of agricultural products has increased. The purchasing power of the people throughout the country has grown more rapidly on the basis of the general improvement during the recovery period. The demand for cotton cloth by the purchasing power of the people throughout the country will increase day by day in the future. Although the area of cotton fields, the yield per unit area of cotton, and the output of cotton cloth in our country have been increasing year by year and will continue to increase in the future, judging from several years of experience, the rate of increase is still not able to keep up with the needs of the people for the time being, and therefore a trend of cotton cloth falling short of demand will appear. In order to enable the state to develop the production of major agricultural products in a planned and proportionate manner; in order to enable the cotton cloth produced throughout the country to be distributed more rationally under the state plan, eliminate speculation by hoarding, stop small producers from being reluctant to sell, and stop consumers from rushing to buy, the state must promptly implement planned purchase and planned supply of cotton cloth and planned purchase of cotton.

Regarding the specific methods for implementing planned purchase and planned supply of cotton cloth and planned purchase of cotton, and the series of preparatory work that has already been carried out for this purpose, Zeng Shan gave detailed explanations at the meeting. He said that in the distribution of cotton cloth, because the consumption levels of the people are different in different regions, a unified standard cannot be stipulated nationwide for the cloth used for people's consumption. On the basis of adapting to the current purchasing power, urban consumption should be increased appropriately less, and rural areas should be supplied more. The people's governments of each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the central government should determine the supply volume of each region according to the different purchasing power of urban and rural people in different regions, according to the control figures stipulated by the national plan.

Cloth coupons will be issued in two phases: the first phase is from September 1954 to February 1955, and the second phase is from March to August 1955. In order to take care of the people's need for cloth in winter, the supply quantity in the first phase will be greater, and the second phase will be smaller. The cloth coupons in the first phase can also be used in the second phase, but the cloth coupons in the second phase cannot be used in advance.

As for the cloth used for production in various industries, the cloth used by government agencies and organizations, and the cloth used for various special needs, users should apply according to the procedures stipulated in various localities, and after verification, they should be supplied in phases or at one time according to the plan. The cloth used for consumer goods such as people's clothing and bedding, regardless of colors and varieties, including cloth-made clothing, bedding, shirts, trousers, and children's clothing of more than four Chinese feet, shall be supplied in a planned manner by adopting the method of regional, quantitative, and voucher-based supply. Knitted goods, silk, wool, and linen fabrics that use cotton yarn as raw materials will not be subject to planned supply for the time being.

In order to take care of soldiers' self-addition of underwear, it is planned to allocate a certain amount from the various items requiring cloth and issue cloth coupons, which will be distributed uniformly by military organs.

Regarding the issue of planned purchase of cotton, Zeng Shan said: When implementing the planned purchase of cotton, the method of one-time subscription and sale is generally adopted, and the township people's government and the supply and marketing cooperatives organize farmers to deliver the cotton in an orderly manner by village and area. When conditions permit in various localities, trial production and sales should be carried out with emphasis, so that the purchase volume can reach a reasonable level. When purchasing, supply and marketing cooperatives should purchase seed cotton as much as possible, organize rural processing forces in a planned manner, process it in a timely manner, and maintain close contact with local agricultural departments in order to preserve good varieties and improve cotton quality; at the same time, the state should further control oil sources. The supply and marketing cooperatives should provide convenience for the processing of seed cotton used by cotton farmers for seed retention. At the same time, in order to take care of the habits of some cotton farmers who sell lint cotton, a portion of lint cotton should also be purchased.

Zeng Shan finally pointed out: Planned purchase and planned supply of cotton cloth and planned purchase of cotton are an important policy of the state during the transition period, and also an extremely complex and arduous political task. Therefore, in the process of implementation, it is necessary to simultaneously do a good job in propaganda and education work among the masses. It is required that the central and local propaganda and education departments strengthen propaganda in this regard, so that the broad masses of people fully understand that this measure is necessary and in line with the current and long-term interests of the state and the people.

Subsequently, after listening to the explanation made by Gan Siqi, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Central People's Government's People's Revolutionary Military Commission, the meeting adopted the order on conscripting replacements. The order decided that in order to fill the vacancies of demobilized soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and gradually implement the compulsory military service system, 450,000 replacements will be conscripted from November 1, 1954 to February 28, 1955 before the Military Service Law is promulgated. The order stipulates that this replenishment of soldiers will be carried out among male citizens who are 18 to 22 years old. After citizens are conscripted into the army, the term of active service is: three years for the army, four years for the air force, and five years for the navy. The term of active service starts from March 1, 1955. Before conscripted citizens enlist in the army, the state health authorities will conduct physical examinations. The physical examination standards shall be stipulated by the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government and the Ministry of Health of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission. Citizens of the prescribed conscription age who are the only labor force or only child in the family may be granted a postponement of conscription after examination and approval by the people's governments of non-districted cities, districts under the jurisdiction of cities, townships, and towns. The order also stipulates that those who have been deprived of political rights in accordance with the law shall not be conscripted into the army.

The meeting then listened to and approved the report made by Wu Bo, Deputy Minister of Finance of the Central People's Government, on the establishment of the China People's Construction Bank, and adopted the decision on the establishment of the China People's Construction Bank.

In addition, the meeting also approved various appointment and removal cases and submitted appointment and removal cases to the Central People's Government Committee for approval.

    中央人民政府政务院二二四次政务会议
    批准实行棉布统购统销和棉花统购
    并通过了关于征集补充兵员的命令
    【新华社十三日讯】中央人民政府政务院第二百二十四次政务会议在九日上午举行。会议听了和批准了政务院财政经济委员会副主任兼中央人民政府商业部部长曾山所作的“关于准备实施棉布计划收购、计划供应和棉花计划收购”的报告，通过了“关于实行棉布计划收购和计划供应的命令”和“关于实行棉花计划收购的命令”。
    曾山在报告中从五年来棉花、棉纱、棉布生产的恢复、发展和人民用布量逐年增加的情况来说明实行棉布计划收购、计划供应和棉花计划收购的物资基础和必要性。他说，五年以来，在中国共产党和中央人民政府的正确领导下，由于土地改革后广大农民发挥了生产积极性，我国棉花总产量从一九五一年起连年都超过抗日战争以前（一九三六年）最高生产水平。如果把一九三六年全国棉花总产量算做一○○，那么一九五一年是一二三，一九五二年是一五二，一九五三年是一三九。棉纱和棉布生产也有了很大的发展。到今年年底为止投入生产的纱锭总数，将比全国解放时所有能够生产的纱锭总数增加百分之二十二点三，织布机（不包括棉织厂和染织厂的）将增加百分之二十六点五。纺织品增加的比例更大大超过设备增长的比例。
    他说：随着全国棉花增产和纺织工业的恢复、发展，和人民购买力的不断提高，全国人民平均每人每年对机织棉布的消费量逐年增加。一九五○年全国平均每人消费机织布一一点九九市尺，至一九五三年已增加到二三点○八市尺，土布的消费量尚未计算在内。从供应市场布匹的统计分析，逐年的增长情况是：一九五一年比一九五○年增加百分之三三点四七；一九五二年比一九五一年增加百分之一七点一八；一九五三年比一九五二年增加百分之四七点八。
    根据上述生产和消费情况，曾山指出：由于国家以大量资金投入经济建设和文化建设，增加了就业人数，增大了社会工资总量，同时农业增产，农产品收购价格提高，全国人民的购买力在恢复时期已经普遍提高的基础上更加迅速地增长起来。全国人民购买力对棉布的需求今后将日益增长。五年以来，我国棉田数量、棉花单位面积产量和棉布的产量虽然是逐年都在增长而且今后仍将继续增长，但从几年的经验看来，增长的速度一时还赶不上人民的需要，因而将出现棉布供不应求的趋势。为了使国家对主要农产品的生产能够有计划地、按比例地发展；为了使全国生产的棉布能在国家计划下进行较为合理的分配，取缔投机商业的囤积居奇，停止小生产者的惜售和消费者的争购，国家必须及时实行棉布的计划收购、计划供应和棉花的计划收购。
    关于实施棉布计划收购、计划供应和棉花计划收购的具体办法，和为此已经进行了的一系列的准备工作，曾山在会上都作了详细说明。他说，在棉布分配上，人民消费用布因各地消费水平不同，不能在全国规定一个统一标准。在适应目前购买力的基础上，适当少增城市消费，较多供应农村，由各省、自治区、直辖市人民政府根据国家计划规定的控制数字，按照不同地区城乡人民购买力的不同情况，确定各该地区的供应量。
    购布票将分两期发票：第一期自一九五四年九月至一九五五年二月，第二期一九五五年三月至八月。为了照顾人民冬季用布第一期供应数量较多，第二期较少。第一期购布票在第二期也可通用，但第二期购布票不能提前使用。
    至于各行业生产用布，机关团体和各种特殊需要用布，由用户按照各地规定手续申请，经核实后按计划分期或一次供应。人民衣着被褥等消费用布，不分花色品种，包括布制的服装、被褥、衬衣、衬裤和用布四尺以上的童装，一律采取分区、定量、凭证的供应办法实行计划供应。其他以棉纱为原料的针织品，丝、毛、麻织品，暂不实行计划供应。
    为照顾军人自添内衣，拟在各种需要用布项内，划出一定数量，发给购布票，交由军事机关统一分配。
    关于棉花计划收购问题，曾山说：实行棉花计划收购时，一般采取一次认售的办法，并由乡人民政府和供销合作社组织农民分村分片有秩序地交售。各地在条件具备时，应有重点地试行评产评售，以便使收购量达到合理。供销合作社在收购时，应尽可能收购籽棉，有计划地组织农村的加工力量，及时加工，并同当地农业部门密切联系，以便保留良种，提高棉质；同时使国家进一步掌握油源。对植棉农民留种用的籽棉，供销合作社应给以加工的便利。同时为照顾部分植棉农民出售皮棉的习惯，亦应收购一部分皮棉。
    曾山最后并指出：棉布计划收购、计划供应和棉花计划收购是国家在过渡时期的一项重要政策，也是极为复杂而艰巨的一项政治任务。因此在实施过程中，必须同时做好对群众的宣传教育工作。要求中央和各地宣传教育部门加强对这方面的宣传，使广大人民充分了解这个措施是必要的，是符合于国家和人民的目前利益和长远利益的。
    接着，会议在听了中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总政治部副主任甘泗淇所作的说明后，通过了关于征集补充兵员的命令。命令决定：为了补充人民解放军退伍兵员的缺额及逐步推行义务兵役制，特在兵役法未颁布以前，从一九五四年十一月一日到一九五五年二月二十八日征集补充兵员四十五万人。命令规定此次补充兵员在年满十八周岁到二十二周岁的男性公民中进行征集。公民应征入伍后，服现役的期限：陆军为三年，空军为四年，海军为五年。现役期限从一九五五年三月一日算起。应征公民入伍前，由国家卫生机关进行体格检查。体格检查标准，由中央人民政府卫生部和人民革命军事委员会卫生部规定。凡适合规定的征集年龄的公民，如系家庭中唯一劳动力或独子，经不设区的市、市辖区、乡、镇人民政府审查批准，可予缓征。命令并规定不得征集依照法律被剥夺政治权利的人入伍。
    会议接着听了和批准了中央人民政府财政部副部长吴波所作的关于设立中国人民建设银行的报告，通过了关于设立中国人民建设银行的决定。
    此外，会议并通过了各项任免案及提请中央人民政府委员会批准任免案。
