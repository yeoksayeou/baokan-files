Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 7th. The People's Liberation Army border defense troops stationed in Yunnan have resolutely struck at the Chiang Kai-shek bandit remnants led by Li Mi who fled across the border over the past five years, defending the security of the motherland's Yunnan border.

When the Southwest was liberated, after the Chiang bandit army's Li Mi troops were annihilated by our People's Liberation Army, losing over 31,000 men, the remnants fled abroad, entrenched in the border areas between China and Myanmar, and Myanmar and Thailand. Under the protection of the American aggressors and the reactionary Thai authorities they manipulated, Li Mi's remnants have continuously invaded our border areas for several years, and sent special agents to sneak into our mainland to carry out sabotage activities. In late May 1951, Li Mi's remnants invaded the Gengma, Shuangjiang, and Cangyuan areas, and were annihilated in part by our army's encirclement and suppression, with the remaining troops driven out of the country. In July of the same year, Li Mi's remnants invaded Mengma, Menglian, Mengdong and other places in several routes. Our troops guarding the border resolutely defeated them, shattering Li's bandits' dream of establishing a large-scale base in the border area. After that, Li's bandits constantly disturbed our border with small groups of troops, and they were all met with annihilating blows by our army.

After Li's bandits were militarily defeated by our army, they particularly strengthened their espionage activities. Li's bandits used all kinds of despicable means in a vain attempt to provoke the close relations between the various fraternal nationalities in our border areas, in order to undermine our border defense. However, under the influence of our army's correct implementation of ethnic policies, the awareness of the people of all fraternal nationalities in loving the motherland has been increasing day by day. They actively assisted the People's Liberation Army in capturing special agents and escaped bandits, and organized joint defense to assist the troops in eliminating small groups of bandits who fled into the country. In April of this year, a company of the People's Liberation Army stationed in a certain place in southern Yunnan, with the assistance of the local ethnic minorities, captured all seventeen bandits who illegally crossed the border alive without firing a single shot. Once, the Muqia Village of Lancangjiang was surrounded by Li Mi's remnants, and the entire village immediately mobilized more than 300 militiamen, repelling the bandits' nine attacks in a row. From the spring of last year to May of this year, with the assistance of the people of all fraternal nationalities, our People's Liberation Army launched a powerful political offensive and won over a total of 2,560 bandit leaders and bandit followers to surrender to us.

Under the resolute blows of our People's Liberation Army border defense troops and the people of all fraternal nationalities, the remaining Li bandits who had sneaked into the Yunnan border area have been basically wiped out. However, it is worth noting that the remnant bandit troops of Li Mi of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, who fled to Myanmar from the winter of 1953 to May of this year, under the protection of the American aggressors, and regardless of the condemnation of international public opinion and the just accusations of the Myanmar government, still maintain their main remnants on the Myanmar-Thai border and outside the border line of our Che (li) Fo (hai) Nan (qiao), and are actively reorganizing, vainly attempting to seize the opportunity to invade our border defense, while continuing to endanger Myanmar's security. Our border defense troops are paying close attention to this and are guarding the border with a hundredfold vigilance, ready to crush any disturbances by Li Mi's remnant bandits at any time.

    解放军保卫了祖国云南边疆安全
    五年来坚决打击了窜犯国境的蒋贼残部
    【新华社昆明七日电】中国人民解放军驻云南边防部队，五年来坚决地打击了窜犯国境的蒋贼残余军队李弥部，保卫了祖国云南边疆的安全。
    西南解放时，蒋贼军李弥部队被我人民解放军歼灭三万一千余人后，残部逃至境外，盘踞于中缅及缅泰边境。在美国侵略者及其所操纵的泰国反动当局的庇护下，几年来李弥残部不断侵犯我边境，并派遣特务潜入我国内地进行破坏活动。一九五一年五月下旬，李弥残部曾进犯我耿马、双江、沧源地区，在我军围剿下被歼灭一部，余部被逐出境外。同年七月，李弥残部又分路窜犯我孟马、孟连、孟董等地，我守卫边疆的部队坚决将其击溃，粉碎了李匪企图在边境建立大规模基地的梦想。之后，李匪不断以小股部队窜扰我边境，也都遭到我军歼灭性的打击。
    李匪在军事上遭到我军打击之后，特别加强了特务活动。李匪用各种各样的卑劣手段，妄图挑拨我边疆各兄弟民族的亲密关系，以达到破坏我边防的目的。但在我军正确执行民族政策的影响下，各兄弟民族人民热爱祖国的觉悟日益提高，他们积极协助人民解放军捕捉特务和漏网散匪，并组织联防协助部队消灭窜入境内的小股残匪。今年四月，人民解放军驻守滇南某地的一个连队，在当地少数民族人民的协助下，一枪未发，即全部活捉了偷越国境的十七名匪徒。澜沧江木戛寨有一次被李弥残匪包围，全寨立即动员了三百多个民兵，一连打退匪徒九次进攻。去年春天到今年五月，我人民解放军在各兄弟民族的协助下，发动了强大的政治攻势，共争取匪首及匪众二千五百六十余人向我投诚。
    在我人民解放军边防部队和各兄弟民族人民的坚决打击下，潜入云南边境地区的残余李匪已被基本肃清。但是值得注意的是：一九五三年冬季到今年五月逃到缅甸的蒋介石卖国集团的李弥残余匪部，在美国侵略者的庇护下，不顾国际舆论的谴责和缅甸政府的正义控诉，仍保存其主要残部于缅泰边境及我国车（里）佛（海）南（峤）边境线外，并积极重新整编，妄图伺机进犯我国边防，同时继续危害缅甸安全。我边防部队对此极为注意，正以百倍警惕严守边防，随时准备粉碎李弥残匪的任何窜扰。
