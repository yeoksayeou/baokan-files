Ambassador, Comrades, Friends:

    Today is the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of Bulgaria. On behalf of the Chinese people and the Government of the People's Republic of China, I extend warm congratulations to the Bulgarian people and the Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria.

    Since their liberation, the diligent and brave Bulgarian people, under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party and with the selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union, have victoriously carried out various social reforms, restored the national economy, and completed the first five-year plan in four years, achieving brilliant successes in the country's socialist construction. Now, they are implementing the second five-year plan, which is mainly aimed at improving the material and cultural living standards of the working people, with unparalleled labor enthusiasm and full confidence. The Chinese people warmly congratulate the Bulgarian people on these brilliant achievements in all aspects over the past ten years and are encouraged by these achievements.

    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the friendly relations between the Chinese and Bulgarian people have greatly developed, and our two countries' economic cooperation and cultural exchanges are expanding and developing day by day. Recently, Lieutenant General Dyakov and the Bulgarian People's Army Song and Dance Ensemble were invited to visit our country, and a delegation of the Government of the People's Republic of China went to Sofia to participate in the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of Bulgaria. This illustrates the close and friendly relations between our two peoples.

    Because our two peoples share common ideals, a desire for mutual assistance and cooperation, and the determination to defend world peace, I am convinced that the friendly cooperation between our two countries in various fields will continue to develop with the advancement of socialist construction in both countries, thereby making greater contributions to strengthening the world peace and democracy forces led by the Soviet Union and safeguarding world peace.

    Long live the People's Republic of

    朱德副主席在招待会上的讲话大使同志，各位同志，各位朋友：
    今天是保加利亚人民共和国第十周年国庆纪念日，我代表中国人民和中华人民共和国政府向保加利亚人民和保加利亚人民共和国政府，致以热烈的祝贺。
    勤劳勇敢的保加利亚人民，解放以后，在保加利亚共产党的领导下，在伟大的苏联的无私援助下，胜利地进行了各种社会改革，恢复了国民经济，并以四年的时间完成了第一个五年计划，在国家的社会主义建设事业中获得了辉煌的成就。现在，他们正以无比的劳动热情、满怀信心地实现着以提高劳动人民的物质和文化生活水平为主要任务的第二个五年计划。中国人民热烈祝贺保加利亚人民十年来在各方面所获得的这些辉煌成就，并为这些成就而感到欢欣鼓舞。
    自从中华人民共和国建国以来，中保两国人民的友好关系已经有了很大的发展，我们两国的经济合作和文化交流正在日益扩大和发展。最近，迪亚科夫中将和保加利亚人民军歌舞团应邀来我国访问和中华人民共和国政府代表团前往索非亚参加保加利亚人民共和国第十周年国庆大典，说明了我们两国人民之间的亲密友好关系。
    由于我们两国人民有着共同的理想、互助合作的愿望和捍卫世界和平的决心，我深信，我们两国之间在各方面的友好合作，必将随着双方社会主义建设事业的推进而不断发展，从而对于以苏联为首的世界和平民主力量的加强和维护世界和平的事业作出更大的贡献。
    保加利亚人民共和国万岁！
    中保两国人民牢不可破的兄弟般的友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的世界和平民主力量万岁！
    让我们为保加利亚人民的领袖契尔文科夫同志的健康干杯！
