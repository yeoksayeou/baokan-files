Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, September 5th: Our correspondent reports on the scene of our coastal artillery fiercely bombarding the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops' positions on the Greater and Lesser Jinmen Islands and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit naval vessels anchored in Jinmen Harbor:

At 2:00 PM on September 3rd, under the bright sunshine of the motherland's sky, a deafening barrage of artillery fire suddenly erupted from our coastal artillery positions. A large number of shells flew continuously across the sea, landing on the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops' positions like a torrential downpour. From the observation post of our army, I looked down through the observation hole and saw that in an instant, the front lines of all Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops on the Greater and Lesser Jinmen Islands were filled with smoke and flames soared into the sky. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit artillery, which used to frequently harass the coast of our motherland, was silenced under the fierce suppression of our artillery fire. Six of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops' positions had their bunkers, shelters, and other fortifications completely overturned. Another position was hit directly by many large-caliber shells in succession, and the entire position collapsed. Elsewhere, a company of Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops that was gathering also suffered a fierce bombardment from our artillery fire. At this time, nearly ten Chiang Kai-shek bandit naval vessels anchored in Jinmen Harbor were thrown into chaos within the dense circle of our artillery fire. One submarine chaser sped to the foot of Dagushan on Lesser Jinmen, attempting to take cover, but was hit by our artillery fire. Two other submarine chasers attempted to escape, but under the pursuit of our powerful artillery fire, one was damaged and the other fled in panic to the outer sea. The other six or seven gunboats, tugboats, and transport ships that did not have time to escape quickly scurried to hide around the Shuitou floating pier, but they could not escape the bombardment of our artillery fire. After a series of violent explosions, black smoke and flames rose from the Shuitou floating pier. This floating pier, painstakingly built by the Chiang Kai-shek navy over the years, was completely destroyed. One Chiang Kai-shek bandit gunboat and one tugboat attempting to escape were immediately sunk to the bottom of the sea, and the rest were damaged. At this time, cheers resounded everywhere in our army's positions. Commanders and combatants along the entire line expressed excitedly: We must liberate Jinmen and Taiwan!

    我海防炮兵猛烈轰击金门岛蒋贼军的情景
    【新华社福建前线五日电】本社记者报道我海防炮兵猛烈轰击大、小金门岛的蒋贼军阵地和停泊在金门港内的蒋贼海军舰艇的情景说：
    九月三日下午二时，在祖国天空明朗的阳光下，我军海防炮兵的阵地上突然响起一阵震耳欲聋的炮声，大批炮弹接连不断越过海面，简直像下猛雨那样的落在蒋贼军的阵地上爆炸。记者从我军观察所的了望孔中俯视，只见霎时间大、小金门前沿蒋贼军所有阵地上硝烟弥漫，烈焰冲天。过去时常袭扰祖国海岸的蒋贼军炮兵都在我军炮火的猛烈压制下变成了哑吧，有六个蒋贼军阵地上的碉堡、掩体和其他工事全被打翻。另一个阵地连续被直接打中许多发巨型炮弹，阵地全部崩毁。另一处，正在集结的蒋贼军的一个连队也遭到了我军炮火的猛烈轰击。在这个时候，停泊在金门港内的近十艘蒋贼军舰艇，在我稠密的炮火圈中乱成一团。有一艘驱潜舰疾驶到小金门的大股山脚下企图躲避，被我炮火命中。另有两艘驱潜舰企图潜逃，但在我强大炮火的追击下，一艘受了创伤，另一艘慌忙逃向外海。另外六、七艘来不及逃跑的炮艇、拖轮和运输船，赶紧钻到水头活动码头一带躲藏起来，但它们也逃脱不了我军炮火的轰击。在一阵猛烈的巨响过去以后，水头活动码头冒起了黑烟和火焰，这个由蒋贼海军几年来苦心构筑的活动码头全部被击毁了，企图逃跑的蒋贼军炮艇、拖轮各一艘，立即都被打沉海底，其余的也都被打伤了。这时，我军阵地上，到处欢声雷动。全线指挥员、战斗员们都兴奋地表示：我们一定要解放金门和台湾。
