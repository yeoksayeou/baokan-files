    The Serious Frustration of the U.S. War Policy in Europe
    Tan Wenrui
    The French National Assembly held a meeting on the "European Defense Community" issue starting on August 28. After three days of debate, on August 30, it passed a motion to "move to the next agenda item" with 319 votes against 264, rejecting the "European Defense Community" treaty. This is a huge victory for the French people's movement to fight for peace and ease international tensions, and it severely hit the U.S.'s heinous plot to revive German militarism to create war in Europe.
      The "European Defense Community" plan meeting such an end in France is by no means accidental. It is the result of the long-term and resolute struggle of the broad masses of the French people against the "European Defense Community" treaty.
    As everyone knows, the so-called "European Defense Community" plan is the "cornerstone" of the war policy pursued by the U.S. aggressive bloc in Europe. For several years, the U.S. has spared no effort to put together a Western European six-nation military group with West Germany as its core, intending to rebuild West Germany's "national defense force" under the guise of so-called "common defense," thereby blocking the road to a peaceful solution to the German problem and deepening the division of Europe, turning West Germany into a hotbed for new wars. Undoubtedly, such a military group plan in the name of "defense" is not in line with the security interests of Europe. It first endangers the independence, sovereignty, and security of France and other Western European countries.
  Once the "European Defense Community" is established, France and several other Western European countries will be shackled by the military obligations of the Paris Treaty, while West Germany will be able to rebuild its military strength. This is why the Bonn revanchists, who are bent on following Hitler's old path, are so enthusiastic about this "European Defense Community" plan. Adenauer and his colleagues have repeatedly stated publicly that they believe that enabling West Germany to participate in the "European Defense Community" is the best way to "recover lost territories." According to West German Federal Assembly member Schmidt-Wittmack's disclosure at a press conference in Berlin on August 26, the U.S. and the Bonn group concluded a secret agreement in July this year to allow West Germany to establish a West German army corps of twenty-four divisions (instead of twelve divisions as stipulated in the "Paris Treaty"), and to establish a reserve army of twenty-four divisions. People cannot help but recall what Bonn's Minister of the Army, Blank, once said: "If a future German army of 520,000 men is not enough to stop the Russians, at least it will be able to fulfill its duties on the French side for everything else." No wonder French political leader Edouard Herriot exclaimed at this National Assembly meeting: "The European Defense Community means the end of France from now on."
      The "European Defense Community" plan so obviously damages France's national interests that it is clearly impossible for France to swallow this bitter pill. From the beginning, the French people opposed the ratification of this treaty, and the movement against the "European Defense Community" grew stronger. Not only the broad masses of the working people, but also patriotic people from all walks of life in France and many far-sighted politicians in various French parties increasingly demanded the abandonment of the "Paris Treaty," which aims to revive West German militarist forces and establish an aggressive military bloc. This strong will cannot but be reflected in the French parliament. Many members of parliament from different parties have expressed a negative attitude towards the "European Defense Community" treaty. It is precisely this situation that has made the supporters of the "European Defense Community" unable or unwilling to bring the "Paris Treaty" to the parliament for debate and voting for a long time. As a result, the "Paris Treaty" has been shelved since it was signed in May 1952.
    Since the end of the Berlin Conference, the situation in Europe and the world has developed significantly. The Soviet Union's proposal to establish a European collective security system has taken root in the hearts of the people in Europe. The people of France and other Western European countries have seen the real path to ensuring European security from this, and therefore understand that they have no reason to be dragged into the disastrous path by the U.S. The achievements of the Geneva Conference have greatly encouraged the French and other Western European people's confidence in winning peace. They realize that since negotiation can end the eight-year Indochina War in Asia, there is no reason why the European problem cannot be resolved through negotiation. Establishing war groups and rearming West Germany will only lead to new wars, and will absolutely not be of any benefit to European peace and the security of all countries. At the same time, the French people cannot but notice the increasingly rampant war cries of the Bonn group and its increasingly aggressive arrogance towards France. Important figures in the Bonn regime, such as Rongen, Director of the West German "Office for the Protection of the Constitution," Kapenke, Deputy Head of the West German espionage organization, and West German Federal Assembly member Wettmark mentioned above, have successively defected to the Democratic German side because they saw through the Adenauer group's adventurous conspiracy, exposing the aggressive ambitions of the West German revanchists and their true intentions towards the "European Defense Community." The matter is so clear, so how can one expect the French people to hand over their fate to the Bonn revanchists? The true guarantee of European and French security is entirely attainable. The Soviet Union has been tirelessly working to establish a European collective security system. In July, the Soviet Union twice proposed to the U.S., Britain, and France to convene an all-European conference to discuss the issue of guaranteeing European collective security and to convene a four-power foreign ministers' conference to discuss the German issue. All of this has prompted the French people to more resolutely fight against the "European Defense Community" plan and strive to establish a European collective security system, demanding that the parliament abandon the "Paris Treaty" that betrays France.
    Everyone knows that the U.S. planners of the "European Defense Community" have been constantly putting pressure on France for more than two years, coercing it to quickly ratify this deed of sale. In order to achieve this shameful goal, Washington has exhausted all means of coercion and inducement towards France, including threats to stop "aid," intimidation of rearming West Germany, and the deceptive lure of "guaranteeing" French security. The U.S. has repeatedly set timetables for the French government to ratify the "European Defense Community" treaty, and has issued more than one ultimatum to the French government to ratify the "European Defense Community" treaty. However, all these strong pressures from the U.S. have failed to achieve the desired effect; on the contrary, they have only aroused stronger opposition from all levels of the French people. On the eve of and during the debate in the French National Assembly, the U.S.'s pressure became even more intensified. It attempted to collude with its followers at the Brussels meeting to force France to yield, but it failed to succeed. Around August 28, the U.S. stepped up its intimidation and blackmail against France. U.S. diplomatic officials openly declared that if the French National Assembly did not ratify the "European Defense Community" treaty, the U.S. would "take drastic action" to ensure the rearmament of Germany; at the same time, its accomplices in France tried every means to obstruct the parliament from debating and making a decision on this issue, and formed a "Save the European Defense Community" alliance to engage in a final struggle, but it was finally unable to save the bankruptcy of the "European Defense Community."
    In this National Assembly debate, the parliament's six committees related to the "European Defense Community" issue presented sharp criticisms of the treaty from different perspectives in their respective reports. They illustrated how this treaty seriously damages France's independent sovereignty and what terrible consequences it will bring to France. It is impossible for the supporters of the "European Defense Community" to refute the arguments of these committees and conceal the dangers of the "European Defense Community" treaty. Because: this treaty violates the Franco-Soviet treaty, the Yalta Agreement, and the Potsdam Proclamation, which call for disarming Germany and eliminating German militarism; once this treaty is implemented, France will not be able to guarantee its own national defense, its army will be controlled by foreign forces, and West Germany will immediately gain military superiority over France, thereby threatening French security; this treaty stipulates that France's entire economy must be subject to "military needs," which will inevitably lead to the collapse of the national economy. Therefore, on the issue of the "European Defense Community," France is actually facing such a choice: Does France want to be a major power and bear the responsibility of peacefully resolving the German issue and ensuring European security together with other major powers? Or does it give up its sovereignty and submit to the domination of foreign countries and suffer the threat of being invaded by German militarists again? Under such circumstances, every member of the French parliament who dares to face the facts, except for those U.S. agents, obviously cannot but adopt an opposition stance towards the "European Defense Community" treaty. It is worth noting that more than 50 members of the Socialist Party voted against the "European Defense Community" treaty despite the threats from the Socialist Party leadership, which shows how unpopular this war treaty is in France. Therefore, its bankruptcy is naturally inevitable.
    The French National Assembly's rejection of the "European Defense Community" treaty has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the French people and peace-loving people all over the world. French public opinion happily pointed out that this means that "the obstacles on the road to establishing lasting peace in Europe have also been eliminated" (Liberation). However, the U.S. ruling clique could not hide their disappointment and frustration. U.S. President Eisenhower "painfully" admitted that this was "a serious setback" for the U.S. war policy, and Secretary of State Dulles also said that it was "a heartbreaking thing." This is precisely because France's rejection of the "European Defense Community" treaty completely disrupted the U.S.'s war plan.
    However, it must be pointed out that it would be a big mistake to think that the U.S. aggressive bloc, which is determined to rebuild West Germany's "national defense force" as a tool for it to rule Europe and launch new wars, will give up because France rejected the "European Defense Community" treaty. Eisenhower openly said in his speech on August 30: "We will not let go." Dulles also claimed that he was prepared to convene the North Atlantic Treaty Council in October to discuss arranging the rearmament of West Germany through the North Atlantic aggressive group. Therefore, the French people must continue to be vigilant against new U.S. conspiracies. The U.S. aggressive bloc has tried its best to propagate that rearming West German militarists is unchangeable and inevitable, and that France can only choose between passing the "European Defense Community" or separately rebuilding West Germany's "national defense force." This is obviously intimidation of France. The fact is: as long as France resolutely opposes it, the revanchists who want to arm West Germany will not succeed. France is entirely possible to avoid the threat of West German revanchists and ensure the security of France and the whole of Europe.
    Since France has rejected the path of establishing an aggressive group that the U.S. has arranged for it, it should decisively follow a policy of promoting the establishment of a reliable collective security system in Europe, which is in line with its national interests. The Soviet Union's proposal to convene a four-power foreign ministers' conference to discuss the issue of convening an all-European conference on guaranteeing European collective security and the German issue is still awaiting a response from the three Western countries. Considering its own national interests, France has no reason to refuse or delay convening such a conference. In this debate in the French National Assembly, many members of parliament expressed their support for seeking ways to ensure European security through consultation. Herriot pointed out: "Seeking peace cannot be achieved through the road to war." He hoped that all countries would "live in harmony." French Prime Minister Mendes-France also said that he was not opposed to convening a four-power conference and "any measures that could lead to peace." So what is preventing France from breaking away from the shackles of the U.S. and adopting a policy that is in line with its own national interests? The result of the French National Assembly's vote has once again demonstrated that the increasingly powerful strength and effective actions of the French people are fully capable of crushing those heinous plans that betray national interests, and are capable of promoting their government to adopt an independent foreign policy. We firmly believe that the French people, who have achieved new victories in the struggle for peace, will continue to defeat all new conspiracies to revive West German militarism with resolute struggle, and make every effort to strive for the realization of European collective security and peace.

    美国在欧洲的战争政策的严重挫败
    谭文瑞
    法国国民议会八月二十八日起举行关于“欧洲防务集团”问题的会议，经过了三天的辩论，于八月三十日以三百一十九票对二百六十四票通过了“进入下一项议程”的动议，拒绝了“欧洲防务集团”条约。这是法国人民争取和平与缓和国际紧张局势运动的一个巨大胜利，它沉重地打击了美国复活德国军国主义以在欧洲制造战争的罪恶阴谋。
      “欧洲防务集团”计划在法国遭到这样的下场绝不是偶然的。它是法国广大阶层人民多年以来为反对“欧洲防务集团”条约而进行坚决斗争的结果。
    人所共知，所谓“欧洲防务集团”计划，是美国侵略集团在欧洲推行的战争政策的“基石”。几年来美国费尽了气力来拼凑一个以西德为核心的西欧六国军事集团，而打算在所谓“共同防御”的幌子下，重建西德的“国防军”，借以堵死和平解决德国问题的道路和加深欧洲的分裂，把西德变成为新战争的温床。无容置疑，这样一个以“防御”为名的军事集团计划是不符合欧洲的安全利益的，它首先危害法国和其他西欧国家的独立主权和安全。
  “欧洲防务集团”一旦建立起来，法国和其他几个西欧国家就要被巴黎条约的军事义务束缚住手脚而西德却得以重建它的军事力量。这也就是为什么一心想走希特勒老路的波恩复仇主义者如此热中于这个“欧洲防务集团”计划的原故。阿登纳和他的同僚都曾不止一次地公开说过，他们认为使西德参加 “欧洲防务集团”是“收复失地”的最好办法。据西德联邦议会议员施密特——韦特马克八月二十六日在柏林记者招待会上揭露，美国和波恩集团已于今年七月缔结了秘密协定，准备让西德建立一支二十四个师团（而不是如“巴黎条约”所规定的十二个师）的西德兵团，并成立一支二十四个师的后备军。人们不能不想起波恩的陆军部长布兰克所说过的一段话：“如果将来德国军队五十二万人不足以挡住俄国人的话，至少它有能力为了其他一切事情，在法国方面克尽它的职责。”难怪法国政界领袖爱德华·赫里欧在这次国民议会会议上大声疾呼：“欧洲防务集团意味着法国将从此完结”。
      “欧洲防务集团”计划是如此明显地损害法国的民族利益，要法国吞下这一颗苦丸药显然是不可能的。法国人民一开始就反对批准这一条约，而反对“欧洲防务集团”的运动日益壮大起来，不仅是广大的劳动人民，而且法国各阶层的爱国人士和法国各党派中许多有远见的政治家们也愈来愈激烈地要求摈弃目的在复活西德军国主义势力和建立侵略性军事集团的“巴黎条约”。这种强烈的意志不能不反映到法国的议会中来，许多不同党派的议员都曾对“欧洲防务集团”条约表示过否定的态度。正是这种情势，使得“欧洲防务集团”的拥护者们长期不能或者不敢把“巴黎条约”提到议会上去辩论和表决，因而“巴黎条约”自从一九五二年五月签订以来一直被搁置下来。
    自从柏林会议结束以来，欧洲和世界的形势都有显著的发展。苏联所提出的建立欧洲集体安全的建议在欧洲已深入人心，法国和其他西欧国家的人民都由此看到了保障欧洲安全的真正道路，因而明白他们没有理由要被美国拖进那走向毁灭的歧途。日内瓦会议的成就更是大大鼓舞了法国及其他西欧国家的人民争取和平的胜利信心。他们认识到，协商既然能够结束在亚洲的进行了八年的印度支那战争，那么欧洲问题就没有理由不可以通过谈判来求得解决，建立战争集团和重新武装西德都只会导向新的战争，而绝对不能对欧洲的和平和各国的安全有丝毫的好处。同时，法国人民不能不注意到波恩集团日益猖狂的战争叫嚣以及它对法国的那种愈来愈咄咄逼人的气焰。像西德“保卫宪法局”局长荣恩、西德间谍组织副首领卡朋克和上面提到过的西德联邦议会议员韦特马克等波恩政权中的重要人物，都由于识破了阿登纳集团的冒险阴谋而相继投奔到民主德国方面来，揭露了西德复仇主义者的侵略野心和他们对“欧洲防务集团”所怀抱的真实意图。事情是如此的明白，因此怎能指望法国人民要把自己的命运交到波恩复仇主义者的手中去呢？欧洲和法国安全的真正保障是完全可以获得的。苏联不倦地为建立欧洲集体安全体系而努力。在七月间苏联就曾两度就召开全欧会议讨论关于保障欧洲集体安全问题和召开四国外长会议讨论德国问题向美英法提出了建议。这一切都促使法国人民更加坚决地为反对“欧洲防务集团”计划和争取建立欧洲集体安全体系而斗争，要求议会抛弃出卖法国的“巴黎条约”。
    谁都知道，“欧洲防务集团”的美国策划者，两年多以来曾不断地对法国施加压力，胁迫它迅速批准这个卖身契。为了达到这一可耻的目的，华盛顿向法国用尽了一切威迫利诱的手段，包括停止“援助”的威胁，重新武装西德的恫吓，“保证”法国安全的诱骗等各种各样卑鄙的勾当，美国一再地给法国政府规定了批准“欧洲防务集团”条约的时间表，对法国政府发出过不止一次要它批准“欧洲防务集团”条约的最后通牒。但是美国的这一切强大压力，都没有能收到所希望的效果；相反的，只激起了法国各阶层人民更强烈的反对。在法国国民议会举行辩论的前夕和辩论期间，美国的压力就更变本加厉了，它企图在布鲁塞尔会议上和它的追随者们勾结一起来迫使法国就范，但是结果也没有能成功。在八月二十八日前后，美国加紧对法国进行恐吓和讹诈，美国的外交官员公开宣称：假如法国国民议会不批准“欧洲防务集团”条约，美国便将“采取激烈行动”来保证德国的重新武装；同时它在法国的同谋者则千方百计想阻挠议会对这个问题进行辩论和作出决定，并结成了“挽救欧洲防务集团”的联盟来从事最后挣扎，但是终于也不能挽救“欧洲防务集团”的破产。
    在这一次国民议会的辩论中，议会的六个与
  “欧洲防务集团”问题有关的委员会以各自的报告从不同的角度对这个条约提出了尖锐的指责，它们说明了这一条约是如何严重地损害法国的独立主权，并将给法国带来怎样可怕的后果。“欧洲防务集团”的拥护者们要想驳倒这些委员会的论据，掩饰“欧洲防务集团”条约的危险性是办不到的。因为：这个条约违反了要解除德国武装和肃清德国军国主义的法苏条约、雅尔达协定和波茨坦公告；这个条约一旦实施，法国便不能保障自己的国防，它的军队将要受到外力的控制，而西德则立即取得对法国的军事上的优势，从而威胁法国安全；这个条约规定法国整个经济要服从“军事需要”，不可免地会导致国家经济崩溃。因此，在“欧洲防务集团”的问题上，法国实际上是面对着这样的抉择：法国究竟是要作为一个大国和其他大国一起承担和平解决德国问题和保障欧洲安全的责任？还是放弃自己的主权而听命于外国的支配并蒙受再次被德国军国主义者侵略的威胁？在这样的情况下，法国议会中，除了那些美国代理人之外，每一个敢于正视事实的议员，显然不能不对“欧洲防务集团”条约采取反对的立场。值得注意的是，有五十多名社会党的议员不顾社会党领导机构的威吓而投票反对“欧洲防务集团”条约，这说明了这个战争条约在法国是如何的不得人心。因此它的破产自然是不可避免的了。
    法国国民议会对“欧洲防务集团”条约的否决，受到了法国广大人民和全世界爱好和平人民的热烈欢迎。法国的舆论高兴地指出，这意味着“确立欧洲持久和平的道路上的障碍也就随着消除了”（解放报）。但是美国统治集团却掩不住他们的失望和颓丧，美国总统艾森豪威尔“痛心”地承认，这是美国战争政策的“一个严重挫折”，国务卿杜勒斯也说这是“一件令人伤心的事情”。这正是因为法国拒绝“欧洲防务集团”条约，完全打乱了美国的战争计划。
    但是，必须指出，如果认为一心要重建西德
  “国防军”作为它统治欧洲和发动新战争工具的美国侵略集团，因为法国拒绝了“欧洲防务集团”条约将会就此罢手，那就大错特错了。艾森豪威尔八月三十日发表的演说中便公开说：“我们将不撒手不干。”杜勒斯并声称，准备在十月召开北大西洋公约理事会来商量通过北大西洋侵略集团来安排西德的重新武装。因此，法国人民必须继续警惕美国的新阴谋。美国侵略集团曾极力宣传说，重新武装西德军国主义者是不能改变的和不可避免的，法国只可以在通过“欧洲防务集团”或者是单独重建西德
  “国防军”二者之间选择其一。这显然是对法国的恫吓，事实是：只要法国坚决反对，要武装西德的复仇主义者就办不到。法国完全有可能免受西德复仇主义者的威胁，保障法国和整个欧洲的安全。
    法国既然已拒绝了走美国为它所安排的建立侵略集团的道路，就应当果断地遵循一个促进在欧洲建立可靠的集体安全制度的方针，这是符合它的民族利益的。苏联关于召开四国外长会议来讨论召开关于保障欧洲集体安全的全欧会议问题和德国问题的建议还有待西方三国的答复。法国从它自己的民族利益考虑，是没有理由拒绝或拖延召开这样的一个会议的。在这一次法国国民议会的辩论中，许多议员都表示赞成通过协商来谋求保障欧洲安全的途径，赫里欧就指出：“寻求和平是不能通过走向战争的道路的”，他希望各国“和睦相处”。法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯也说过，他并不反对召开四国会议以及“足以导致和平的任何措施”。那么有什么东西阻止法国摆脱美国的羁绊而采取符合自己民族利益的政策呢？法国国民议会的表决的结果已再一次说明了日益强大的法国人民的力量和有力的行动，是完全能够粉碎那些出卖民族利益的罪恶计划的，是能够促使自己的政府采取一个独立的外交政策的。我们坚信，在争取和平中取得了新胜利的法国人民，必将继续以坚决的斗争来击败一切重新复活西德军国主义的新阴谋，并尽一切努力争取保障欧洲集体安全和和平的实现。
