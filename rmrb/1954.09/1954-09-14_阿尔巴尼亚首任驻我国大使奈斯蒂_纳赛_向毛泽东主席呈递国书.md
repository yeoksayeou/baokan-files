Present were Lin Boqu, Secretary-General of the Central People's Government; Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs; Zhang Zongxun, Deputy Chief of General Staff of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission; Wang Bingnan, Director of the General Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Yu Xinqing, Director of the Bureau of Ceremonies of the Central People's Government; Liu Jingyu, Deputy Director of the Department of Soviet and Eastern European Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and Wang Tuo, Deputy Director of the Protocol Department. Ambassador Nase delivered a eulogy to Chairman Mao Zedong upon presenting his credentials, and Chairman Mao Zedong delivered a reply.

Ambassador Nase's eulogy:
	Comrade Chairman,
	I am honored to present to you the credentials of the Presidium of the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Albania appointing me as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the People's Republic of Albania to the People's Republic of China.

	Comrade Chairman, I am deeply satisfied to have this excellent opportunity to represent my country in the People's Republic of China.

	Establishing diplomatic relations and exchanging diplomatic representatives between the People's Republic of Albania and the People's Republic of China is a first in the history of our two countries. This is an extremely important event that is welcomed with sincere joy by the people of our country. Although our two countries are separated by thousands of miles, close and sincere friendship exists between the small population of the Albanian people and the hundreds of millions of brotherly Chinese people. Our two peoples have waged long-term and unyielding struggles against enemies at home and abroad to win our freedom and to establish close friendship with the glorious Soviet people. This common path followed by our two peoples has given rise to a solid friendship between us.

	In the new era opened up by the Great October Socialist Revolution, after the Soviet victory over German fascism and Japanese militarism in World War II, and after the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, historical conditions have arisen in which free peoples can join hands and strengthen their unity for peace and socialism.

	For several years, the Albanian people have admired the heroic war waged by the great Chinese people, under the leadership of the long-tested Chinese Communist Party, to liberate themselves from the enslavement of the Kuomintang and imperialism and to establish their own people's democratic regime.

	The Albanian people celebrated with extreme joy the great victory of the Chinese people announced five years ago by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and considered this victory a historical victory for the Chinese people and the great world peace and democracy camp. This brilliant victory was a fatal blow to imperialism and the most important factor in safeguarding peace in Asia and the world.

	The enemies of peace—the belligerent American warmongers who have consistently pursued a policy of aggression—launched a heinous war in Korea with the aim of extending their aggression to China and all of Asia. The self-sacrificing struggle of the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers defeated the aggression and proved to the American imperialists and their running dogs that the peoples who have already gained their freedom and have become masters of their own destiny are capable of doing many things, and the dark ages of the past are gone forever. The Albanian people have loudly condemned this barbaric aggression and expressed heartfelt sympathy for the just and heroic struggle of the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers.

	We welcome the mighty democratic nation of the great Chinese people—the People's Republic of China—as the most important factor in defending the cause of peace in Asia and the world. Events in recent years have clearly demonstrated that it is impossible to resolve outstanding international issues in Asia and elsewhere in the world without the participation of the People's Republic of China. On the other hand, the results achieved at the Geneva Conference on the cessation of hostilities and the restoration of peace in Indochina have proved that the participation of the People's Republic of China in this conference can be of great help in resolving these issues. The People's Republic of China has become a powerful factor for peace and stability in Asia and a good example for all peoples struggling for freedom and peace. The People's Republic of China's policy of peace and international cooperation, based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, mutual respect for the inviolability of territory and national sovereignty, has won the firm support of the peoples of many countries. The Albanian people and the government of the People's Republic of Albania wish the great Chinese people and the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China further success in their policy of peace and mutual cooperation, and believe that in the near future the People's Republic of China will obtain its legitimate status in the United Nations, which is currently shamefully denied by American imperialism, and will liberate Taiwan from Chiang Kai-shek and American imperialism to complete its task of liberating all of its territory.

	With the sincere help of the Soviet Union, the great Chinese people have achieved tremendous success in the cause of socialist construction through their tireless and selfless labor. Various economic construction plans are being successfully completed, powerful industries equipped with modern machinery are growing, agriculture has also developed greatly, and culture and science are serving the working masses. Now, the Chinese people are breathing freely in their beloved motherland. They are working with confidence and courage to build their happy future and to defend world peace. The Albanian people are pleased with these great victories and wholeheartedly wish the fraternal Chinese people new achievements in ensuring their happy life and in the cause of Asian and world peace.

	Under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party and its democratic government, with the full assistance of the Soviet Union and the fraternal support of various people's democratic countries, the Albanian people are working selflessly to build their new life and are waging an unremitting struggle to defend the cause of peace. Having formed close friendships with the peoples of the powerful democratic camp, the Albanian people are defending and consolidating their young people's state, guarding against various aggression plans and attempts by American imperialism and its servants, and are now advancing with confidence towards their happy future.

	When presenting my credentials to you, Comrade Chairman, please allow me to convey the respect of the Albanian people, the Presidium of the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Albania, and the government to the great Chinese people, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and yourself. Please allow me to express my full confidence that I will receive assistance from you and the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China in carrying out the tasks entrusted to me by the government. On my part, I assure you that I will contribute all my strength to further consolidating the friendship and cooperation between our two peoples.

Chairman Mao Zedong's reply:
	Comrade Ambassador,
	I am very pleased to accept the credentials presented by you, appointing you as the first Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Presidium of the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Albania to the People's Republic of China, and I sincerely thank you for your congratulations.

	The Albanian people are a hardworking and brave people with a glorious revolutionary historical tradition. In the ten years since the liberation of the Albanian people, under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party, they have smashed all destructive conspiracies of enemies at home and abroad, built their beautiful life with full confidence, and achieved brilliant achievements. The patriotic spirit and unparalleled labor enthusiasm displayed by the Albanian people in socialist construction and in the struggle to defend the independence and security of their motherland have impressed the Chinese people.

	For the first time in history, the Chinese and Albanian peoples have established friendly diplomatic relations. For five years, the peoples of our two countries have forged a brotherly friendship. I am convinced: after the exchange of ambassadors, the sincere friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries will surely be further developed, which will not only be conducive to the increase of the happiness of the people of our two countries, but will also help to strengthen the world peace and democratic forces headed by the Soviet Union.

	Comrade Ambassador, I warmly welcome you to be the first Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the People's Republic of Albania to the People’ Republic Of China . You will receive my full support and the support of the Government of the People’s Republic of China in your work to consolidate friendly cooperation between China and Albania.

	I wish you every success in your work.

    阿尔巴尼亚首任驻我国大使奈斯蒂·纳赛
    向毛泽东主席呈递国书
    【新华社十三日讯】阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国首任驻我国特命全权大使奈斯蒂·纳赛在十三日下午六时偕二等秘书雅沙向我国中央人民政府毛泽东主席呈递国书。在场的有中央人民政府秘书长林伯渠，政务院总理兼外交部部长周恩来，人民革命军事委员会副总参谋长张宗逊，外交部办公厅主任王炳南，中央人民政府典礼局局长余心清，外交部苏联东欧司副司长刘靖宇，交际处副处长王拓。纳赛大使呈递国书时向毛泽东主席致颂词，毛泽东主席致答词。
    纳赛大使的颂词主席同志：
    我荣幸地向您呈递阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国人民议会主席团任命我为阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国驻中华人民共和国特命全权大使的国书。
    主席同志，我能有此良好的机会在中华人民共和国代表我的国家，我深感满意。
    在阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国与中华人民共和国之间建立外交关系并交换外交代表，这在我们两国历史上是第一次。这是我国人民衷心愉快地欢迎的一件极重要的事件。虽然我们两国相隔万里，但在人口不多的阿尔巴尼亚人民与数亿人口的兄弟的中国人民之间存在着亲密的和真诚的友谊。我们两国人民为争取自己的自由，为了建立与光荣的苏联人民的亲密友谊，曾经进行了长期的反对国内外敌人的不屈不挠的斗争。我们两国人民所遵循的这种共同道路就产生了我们之间的巩固的友谊。
    在伟大十月社会主义革命所开辟的新时代里，在第二次世界大战中苏联战胜德国法西斯主义与日本军国主义以后和在中国人民革命胜利以后，产生了历史性的条件：即自由的各国人民有可能互相携手并为和平与社会主义加强团结。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民几年以来一直对伟大的中国人民在久经考验的中国共产党的领导下，为从国民党和帝国主义奴役下获得解放，并建立自己的人民民主政权所进行的英勇的战争表示钦佩。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民曾以极其愉快的心情庆祝了中华人民共和国中央人民政府五年以前用公告所宣布的中国人民的伟大胜利，并认为这个胜利是中国人民和伟大的世界和平民主阵营的历史性的胜利。这个辉煌的胜利是对帝国主义的一个致命打击，亦是保障亚洲及世界和平的事业中一个最重要的因素。
    和平的敌人——一贯执行着侵略政策的好战的美国战争贩子在朝鲜发动了令人痛恨的战争，其目的是想把侵略扩大到中国及全亚洲。朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军所进行的自我牺牲的斗争使侵略遭到了失败，并向美国帝国主义者及其走狗们证明：那些业已获得自由并已成为自己命运的主人的各国人民是能够做出许多事情的，过去黑暗的时代已经永远地一去而不复返了。阿尔巴尼亚人民曾大声疾呼地反对这种野蛮的侵略并对朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军的正义的和英勇的斗争表示衷心的同情。
    我们欢迎伟大中国人民的强大的民主国家——中华人民共和国，这个国家是保卫亚洲及世界和平事业的一个最重要的因素。近几年来的事件更清楚地证明：如果没有中华人民共和国的参加要解决亚洲及世界其他地方的悬而未决的国际问题是不可能的。另一方面，日内瓦会议关于印度支那停战和恢复和平方面所获得的结果证明了中华人民共和国参加这个会议是能够对解决这些问题有很大帮助的。中华人民共和国已成为一个亚洲和平与稳定的有力因素，成为那些正在为自由与和平而进行斗争的各国人民的一个良好的榜样。中华人民共和国所奉行的以平等、互利、互相尊重领土的神圣不可侵犯和国家主权的各项原则为基础的和平与国际合作的政策获得了许多国家人民的坚决拥护。阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府谨祝伟大的中国人民和中华人民共和国中央人民政府在其执行和平与相互合作的政策中得到进一步的成就，并相信在最近的将来中华人民共和国即将在联合国中取得自己目前为美国帝国主义所可耻地否认的合法地位，并将从蒋介石和美国帝国主义手中解放台湾以完成其解放自己全部领土的任务。
    在苏联的真诚帮助下，伟大的中国人民以自己不倦的忘我的劳动业已在社会主义建设事业中获得了巨大的成就。各项经济建设计划正在顺利地完成着，以现代化机器所装备起来的强大的工业正在日益提高，农业也大大向前发展了，文化和科学都为劳动群众而服务。现在，中国人民在自己亲爱的祖国里自由地呼吸着。他们满怀信心地、勇敢地为了建立自己幸福的将来，为了保卫世界和平而劳动着。阿尔巴尼亚人民以这些伟大的胜利而感到高兴，并衷心地愿望兄弟的中国人民在保障自己的幸福生活和亚洲及世界和平的事业中获得新的成就。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和自己的民主政府的领导下，在苏联全面的帮助下，在各人民民主国家兄弟般的支持下，正在为建设自己的新生活而忘我地劳动着，并为保卫和平事业而进行不倦的斗争。和强大的民主阵营各国人民间结成亲密友谊的阿尔巴尼亚人民保卫并巩固了自己年青的人民国家，防备了美国帝国主义及其仆从国家的各种侵略计划和企图，现在正满怀信心地向自己幸福的未来前进。
    当向您呈递国书的时候，主席同志，请允许我向您转达阿尔巴尼亚人民、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国人民议会主席团和政府对伟大的中国人民、中华人民共和国中央人民政府和您本人的敬意。请允许我表示充分信心，在我执行政府所托付我的任务时，我将得到您和中华人民共和国中央人民政府的帮助。在我这方面，向您保证：我将为进一步巩固我们两国人民之间的友谊和合作贡献出全部的力量。
    毛泽东主席的答词大使同志：
    我非常愉快地接受您所呈递的阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国人民议会主席团任命您为驻中华人民共和国首任特命全权大使的国书，并衷心地感谢您的祝贺。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民是勤劳勇敢的人民，它具有光荣的革命的历史传统。阿尔巴尼亚人民解放后十年来，在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，粉碎了国内外敌人的一切破坏阴谋，满怀信心地建设着自己的美好生活，并取得了光辉的成就。阿尔巴尼亚人民在社会主义建设和捍卫祖国的独立和安全的斗争中所表现的爱国主义精神和无比的劳动热情，使中国人民感到钦佩。
    中、阿两国人民在历史上第一次建立了友好的外交关系。五年来，我们两国人民已结成了兄弟般的友谊。我深信：在互派大使之后，我们两国之间的真诚的友好合作关系必将获得进一步的发展，这不但有利于我们两国人民幸福的增进，并有助于以苏联为首的世界和平民主力量的加强。
    大使同志，我热烈地欢迎您出任阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国驻中华人民共和国的首任特命全权大使。在您为巩固中、阿两国友好合作的工作中，您将得到我和中华人民共和国政府的全力支持。
    我谨祝您在工作中获得完全的成功。
