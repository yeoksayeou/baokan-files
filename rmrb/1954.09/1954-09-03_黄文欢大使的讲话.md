Ambassador Huang Wen Huan's Speech

Vice-Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Comrades!

Today, the Vietnamese people are celebrating the ninth anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam with great joy. This year's National Day comes at a time when the Geneva Conference has just achieved a brilliant victory and peace has been restored in Indochina, which is of particular significance to the Vietnamese people.

Nine years ago, the August Revolution succeeded, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was proclaimed. The bellicose groups of French colonialism, with the assistance of American interventionists, violated the interests of the French people and launched a war of aggression in an attempt to rebuild their criminal colonial rule in Indochina. In order to defend peace, independence, unity, and democracy, the Vietnamese people fought shoulder to shoulder with the people of Cambodia and Laos, and continuously inflicted a series of serious defeats on the French bellicose elements. Along with the armed struggle, under the wise leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people have continuously consolidated the people's democratic regime, carried out construction work in the fields of economy, culture, and education, and begun land reform to further improve the people's living conditions.

Thanks to these victories, and thanks to the efforts made by the Soviet representatives at the Berlin Conference, our government and the French government were able to start negotiations at the Geneva Conference. During the negotiations, the French government had to agree to stop the war and recognize and respect the independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of the Vietnamese people; and recognize that the Vietnamese people would unify their motherland through free general elections. This is a victory for the Vietnamese people, the Cambodian and Lao peoples; it is also a victory for the French people who have consistently strived to end the Indochina war; and it is also a victory for the peace-loving Asian people and the people of the world. These victories are inseparable from the peaceful policies of the Soviet Union and China, which insist on easing international tensions. The concern of the countries of the Colombo Conference for the Indochina issue has also played a positive role.

Vietnam and China have thousands of years of traditional friendship and close relations. The Vietnamese people have received the sympathy and support of the Chinese people in their struggle for their own liberation and the restoration of peace in Indochina. At the Geneva Conference, the delegation of the People's Republic of China, led by Premier Zhou Enlai, together with the Soviet delegation, made extremely important contributions to the Geneva Conference. On this occasion, on behalf of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people, I would like to pay my highest respect and sincere gratitude to the Communist Party of China, the government and people of the People's Republic of China, and their great leader Chairman Mao Zedong.

The flames of war in Indochina have been extinguished. The Vietnamese people will resolutely follow the instructions of President Ho Chi Minh, earnestly implement the terms of the armistice agreement, safeguard and consolidate peace, carry out national construction, and prepare for free general elections to achieve complete independence and unity throughout the country. In order to achieve this goal, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is willing to cooperate sincerely with all Vietnamese who hope for the independence and unity of their motherland, regardless of their past. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam will further strengthen its fraternal cooperation with the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries, and is always ready to establish peaceful and cooperative relations with France, Cambodia, Laos, and the peace-loving countries of the world on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

At present, the American aggressors and their lackeys are racking their brains to try to undermine the armistice agreement in Indochina and are planning a Southeast Asian aggressive group to create tensions and threaten peace and security in Asia. We must be highly vigilant and resolutely oppose these conspiracies.

Ladies and gentlemen, friends! The restoration of peace in Indochina has presented the Vietnamese people with arduous and complex new tasks. But the Vietnamese people, who have been tempered in the great patriotic war and with the support of the fraternal countries and the peace-loving people of the world, will certainly be able to shoulder this historical task and fully realize the independence, unity, and democracy of their motherland.

I propose a toast:

To the complete realization of peace, independence, unity, and democracy in Vietnam!

To the further development of the unbreakable friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and China!

To the growing strength of the world peace forces led by the Soviet Union!

To the health of Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!

### 黄文欢大使的讲话

    黄文欢大使的讲话副主席，女士们，先生们，同志们！
    今天，越南人民怀着极为愉快的心情来庆祝越南民主共和国成立九周年。在日内瓦会议刚取得了辉煌的胜利，和平在印度支那恢复了的情况下，今年国庆节的来到，对于越南人民说来是有着特别重要意义的。
    九年前，八月革命成功，越南民主共和国宣布成立。法国殖民主义的好战集团在美国干涉者的援助下，违背了法国人民的利益，企图在印度支那重建罪恶的殖民统治而发动了侵略战争。为了捍卫和平、独立、统一和民主，越南人民和高棉、寮国人民并肩英勇抗战，不断地给法国好战分子以一系列严重的挫败。跟着武装斗争的同时，越南人民在越南劳动党、越南民主共和国政府和胡志明主席的英明领导下，又不断地把人民民主政权巩固了起来，进行经济、文化、教育等方面的建设工作，并开始进行土地改革，进一步提高人民生活条件。
    由于这些胜利，由于苏联代表在柏林会议上所作的努力，我国政府和法国政府得以在日内瓦会议上开始谈判。在谈判中，法国政府不能不同意停止战争并承认尊重越南人民的独立、主权、统一和领土完整；承认越南人民将通过自由普选，以统一自己的祖国。这是越南人民，高棉和寮国人民的胜利；也是一贯为争取结束印度支那战争的法国人民的胜利；同时也是爱好和平的亚洲人民和世界人民的胜利。这些胜利是和苏联、中国坚持主张缓和国际紧张局势的和平政策分不开的。科伦坡会议的国家对印度支那问题的关心，也起了积极的作用。
    越南和中国之间有着几千年的传统友谊和密切关系。越南人民在为争取自己的解放事业和恢复印度支那和平而斗争的过程中，曾得到中国人民的同情和支持。在日内瓦会议上，周恩来总理率领的中华人民共和国代表团同苏联代表团在一道，对日内瓦会议作了极为重大的贡献。值此机会，我谨代表越南民主共和国政府和越南人民，向中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府和人民及其伟大的领袖毛泽东主席致以崇高的敬意和真诚的谢意。
    印度支那的战火已经扑灭了。越南人民将坚决遵照胡志明主席的指示，切实执行停战协定条款，维护和巩固和平，进行国家建设，准备自由普选，以谋取在全国实现完全的独立与统一。为了实现这个目的，越南民主共和国政府愿意和一切希望祖国独立、统一的越南人精诚合作，而不问其过去如何。越南民主共和国将进一步加强与苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家的兄弟般的合作，并随时准备和法国、柬埔寨、老挝以及世界爱好和平的国家在平等、互利的基础上建立起和平合作的关系。
    目下，美国侵略者及其走狗们，正在处心积虑企图破坏印度支那的停战协定。并正在策划一个东南亚侵略集团，制造紧张局势，威胁亚洲的和平和安全。我们对这些阴谋是要提高警惕和加以坚决反对的。
    女士们，先生们，朋友们！印度支那和平的恢复，已给越南人民提出了繁重和复杂的新的任务。但在伟大的卫国战争中久经锻炼的越南人民，在各兄弟国家和世界爱好和平人民的支持下，他们一定能够担得起这一个历史任务，使自己的祖国的独立、统一和民主得到完全实现。
      我提议：
    为越南的和平、独立、统一和民主的彻底实现；
    为越、中两国人民牢不可破的友谊更加发展；
    为以苏联为首的世界和平力量的日益强大；
    为中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席的健康而干杯！
