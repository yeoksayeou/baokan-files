    Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, September 20th: The Ngo Dinh Diem group and the French army are employing methods of mass roundups and individual arrests and killings to force residents and Catholics to leave Hanoi.
    According to incomplete statistics, in the fifteen days from August 15th to August 29th, there were thirty-two large-scale incidents of residents being captured in Hanoi's urban area. Those participating in these actions included French, foreign, and Bao Dai's troops, as well as puppet police and armed secret agents.
    In the suburbs, they stormed into villages in groups, using the excuse of arresting puppet soldiers who had desperately escaped to avoid being transferred to the South, wantonly capturing people and looting.
    In the urban area, armed personnel were dispatched in formations, sometimes even deploying tanks and armored vehicles to block street intersections and main roads, then searching house by house. Puppet soldiers frankly said: the superiors ordered to arrest those who are unwilling to go to the South.
    The Bao Dai puppet police surrounded and arrested people in Hoang Mai and Tuong Mai for four consecutive days, capturing a total of 480 people. In the southern suburbs of Hanoi, some people who refused to go to South Vietnam were brutally shot.
    Le Quang Luat, the representative of the Ngo Dinh Diem group stationed in North Vietnam, has been prohibiting schools in Hanoi from opening since the ceasefire, with the aim of forcing teachers and students to go to South Vietnam.
    In order to persecute staff who refused to go to South Vietnam, the Hanoi puppet city government printed a registration form, asking them to fill in the reasons for "not retreating." Those who refused to fill it in were immediately arrested. Many staff members, including section chiefs and supervisors, were imprisoned as a result. Some staff who filled in reasons such as "burdened by family" were also not spared. The puppet authority's "Migration Committee" drove large trucks to the doorsteps of these staff members' homes, forcing their entire families to move.

   Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, September 20th: The Ngo Dinh Diem group is looting and destroying public property in Hanoi.
    According to people from Hanoi, the Ngo Dinh Diem group has already demolished many civilian factories and public buildings in Hanoi, even taking down the zinc sheets from the roofs and selling them cheaply. Half of the collection of the Hanoi Central Library has been looted.
    The Hanoi Post and Telecommunications Bureau has been subjected to violent looting and is completely paralyzed. On September 10th, Nguyen Bach Bat, the deputy director of the Hanoi puppet Post and Telecommunications Bureau, led a large number of soldiers from the "Bao Chinh Doan" and armed police to loot more than 800 kilograms of lead ingots and 2,000 kilograms of copper wire from the bureau's warehouse. That afternoon, Le Quang Luat, the representative of the Ngo Dinh Diem group stationed in North Vietnam, led another forty armed personnel to break into the machine factory of the Post and Telecommunications Bureau to dismantle and transport machines, and forced the employees to disband immediately.
    The people of Hanoi are extremely resentful of the destructive actions of the Ngo Dinh Diem group. On the 12th, the employees of the Hanoi Post and Telecommunications Bureau's machine factory and warehouse submitted two identical letters of protest to the Vietnam Central Joint Ceasefire Commission and the Vietnam International Supervisory and Control Commission, respectively. The employees also demanded that the French side return the looted materials in full, pay their wages, and guarantee the safety of the employees.

   Xinhua News Agency, September 20th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, September 19th: Major Pham Hong Thai, the chief representative of the Vietnamese delegation in the North Vietnam Joint Ceasefire Commission, handed a letter to the chief representative of the French delegation in the North Vietnam Joint Ceasefire Commission on September 9th, protesting against the Ngo Dinh Diem group forcing Vietnamese youth and civilians in Hanoi to go to South Vietnam with the support of the local French Federal forces.
    The letter pointed out that the French Federal forces were violating the freedom and democratic rights of the people stipulated in the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference and the Vietnam Armistice Agreement by doing so.
    The letter concluded: "We vehemently protest these acts which seriously violate the Geneva Accords, and demand that the Command of the French Federal forces in North Vietnam should do the following two things:
    1. Release those who have been detained;
    2. Take necessary measures to immediately stop the terror actions carried out by the Ngo Dinh Diem government with the support of the French Federal forces, with the aim of forcing residents to evacuate to South Vietnam."

    越方抗议法方纵容吴庭艳集团破坏河内
    【新华社北越二十日电】吴庭艳集团和法军正在采用集体围捕和个别逮捕、屠杀的手段，强迫居民和公教人员离开河内。
    据不完全统计，在八月十五日到八月二十九日的十五天中，河内市区就发生过三十二次大规模的捕捉居民事件。参加这类行动的有法籍、外籍和保大的军队以及伪警察、武装暗探等。
    在市郊，他们成群结队地冲进村庄，借口逮捕那些坚决不愿撤到南部去而冒死逃跑的伪军士兵，肆意捕人和抢劫。
    在市区内，武装人员整队出动，有时还出动坦克和装甲车堵住街口要道，然后挨家挨户搜查。伪军士兵们直言不讳地说：上级有命令抓那些不愿到南部去的人。
    保大伪军警曾在黄梅、将梅一连围捕了四天，共抓走四百八十人。在河内南郊，有一部分拒绝到南越去的人惨遭枪杀。
    吴庭艳集团驻北越的代表黎光律从停战以来一直禁止河内的学校开学，目的在强迫教师和学生到南越去。
    为了迫害拒绝到南越去的职员，河内伪市府曾印发一种登记表，要他们填写“不撤退”的理由。拒绝填写的立即被逮捕。许多职员包括科长和监督等因此都被关进监牢。有些职员填写“受家庭之累”等等的也不能幸免。伪当局的“迁移委员会”把大卡车开到了这些职员的住屋门口，逼迫他们全家迁走。
   【新华社北越二十日电】吴庭艳集团正在劫夺和破坏河内的公共财产。
    据河内来人说，吴庭艳集团已经拆毁了河内的许多民用工厂和公共建筑物，甚至把屋顶上的锌板拆下来廉价拍卖。河内中央图书馆的藏书已被劫走了一半。
    河内邮电局遭到狂暴的劫掠，已经完全瘫痪。九月十日，河内伪邮电局副局长阮柏拔率领了大批“保政团”的士兵和武装警察，劫走了该局仓库内的八百多公斤铅块和两千公斤铜丝。当天下午，吴庭艳集团派驻北越的代表黎光律又带了四十多名武装人员，冲进邮电局的机器厂拆运机器，并强迫职工立即解散。
    河内人民对吴庭艳集团的破坏行为极为忿恨。十二日，河内邮电局机器厂和仓库的职工们以两份同样的抗议书分别送交越南中央联合停战委员会和越南国际监督和监察委员会。职工们还要求法方如数归还抢走的物资，清付工资，并保证职工们的安全。
   【新华社二十日讯】据越南通讯社北越十九日讯：北越联合停战委员会中的越方代表团首席代表范鸿泰少校在九月九日交给北越联合停战委员会中的法方代表团首席代表一封信，抗议吴庭艳集团在当地法兰西联邦部队的支持下，强迫河内的越南青年和平民到南越去。
    信中指出，法兰西联邦部队这样做是侵犯了日内瓦会议最后宣言以及越南停战协定中所规定的人民的自由和民主权利的。
    信中最后说：“我们激烈抗议这些严重破坏日内瓦协定的行为，并要求在北越的法兰西联邦部队司令部应该做到下列两点：
    一、释放那些被拘留的人；
    二、采取必要措施来立即停止吴庭艳政府在法兰西联邦部队支持下所干的、目的在于强迫居民撤往南越的恐怖行动。”
