    Xinhua News Agency, September 15th: According to the Vietnam News Agency on the 14th, to assist the work of the Cambodian Joint Armistice Commission, the Cambodian armistice parties have formed six local joint armistice groups. The first group is responsible for the provinces of Svay Rieng and Prey Veng, the second group is responsible for a portion of Kampong Cham province on the left bank of the Mekong River, the third group is responsible for a portion of Kampong Cham province on the right bank of the Mekong River and Kampong Thom province, the fourth group is responsible for the provinces of Kampot and Takeo, the fifth group is responsible for the provinces of Kampong Chhnang and Kampong Speu, and the sixth group is responsible for the provinces of Battambang and Pursat.
    Before the departure of the local joint armistice groups, the chief representatives of both delegations to the Cambodian Joint Armistice Commission convened a meeting of more than forty officers from these groups.
    Colonel Thanh Son, chief representative of the General Headquarters of the Khmer Resistance Forces and the Vietnam Volunteer Army Headquarters delegation, reviewed at this meeting the unity of the people of Vietnam and Cambodia in the struggle against a common enemy and for national independence and unification. Speaking about the work of on-the-spot demobilization, Colonel Thanh Son expressed his hope that the cadres of the Joint Armistice Commission would faithfully carry out their tasks, so that the Khmer Resistance Forces could enjoy their place in the national life of Cambodia in accordance with the spirit of the Geneva Accords.
    Colonel Lon Nol, chief representative of the General Headquarters of the Royal Cambodian Army delegation, also pointed out the need to establish lasting friendship between the people of Vietnam and Cambodia.
    Xinhua News Agency, September 16th: According to the Vietnam News Agency on the 15th, in order to implement its tasks more quickly and effectively, the Cambodian Joint Armistice Commission has decided to establish two subcommittees to study the various issues stipulated in the armistice agreement, of which four major issues are:
    (1) On the question of the cessation of hostilities;
    (2) On the question of the release of prisoners of war and detained civilians;
    (3) On the question of the withdrawal of foreign troops from Cambodia;
    (4) On the question of on-the-spot demobilization of the Khmer Resistance Forces and unity in the common life of the entire nation of Cambodia.
    The first subcommittee is responsible for studying the first two issues. Representing the General Headquarters of the Khmer Resistance Forces and the Vietnam Volunteer Army are Kao Sang (Deputy Commander of the Khmer Resistance Forces in eastern Cambodia) and Dr. Nguyen Van Hoa, among others.
    The most discussed issue by this subcommittee is the issue of the release of detained civilians. During the war, especially since 1951, the French Federation forces forced a large number of Cambodian civilians to leave their homes and live a miserable life near French military strongholds. The purpose of this method of concentrating civilians was to facilitate forced conscription at the time and to deal with the activities of the Khmer Resistance Forces. Therefore, these concentrated civilians belong to the category of detained civilians stipulated in Article 8 of the Cambodian Armistice Agreement. Representatives of the Khmer Resistance Forces and the Vietnam Volunteer Army are urging the release of a total of approximately 300,000 concentrated civilians.
    However, the General Headquarters of the Royal Cambodian Army claims that this is only an internal affair of the Kingdom of Cambodia and has nothing to do with the implementation of the armistice agreement. It insists that these civilians voluntarily abandoned their homes and rice fields to live near French military strongholds. Discussions are continuing.
    Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, September 16th: According to the Vietnam News Agency on the 15th, representatives of the Lao Resistance Government and the Vietnam Volunteer Army Headquarters handed over two hundred prisoners of war to the French Federation forces in Cẩm Thủy, Thanh Hóa Province, northern central Vietnam, on September 11th. These prisoners of war included 162 North African prisoners of war, 29 European prisoners of war, 5 Laotian prisoners of war, and 4 Vietnamese prisoners of war. These prisoners of war were all captured in central Laos before the end of 1953.
    Before their repatriation, these prisoners of war wrote many letters to the cadres and soldiers of the Lao combat forces and the Lao people, thanking them for their hospitality.

    柬埔寨停战双方商讨有关执行停战协定问题
    寮国抗战政府和越南志愿人员司令部交给法方二百名战俘
    【新华社十五日讯】据越南通讯社十四日讯：为了协助柬埔寨联合停战委员会工作，柬埔寨停战双方已经组成了六个地方联合停战小组。第一小组负责柴桢和波萝勉两省，第二小组负责磅湛省在湄公河左岸的一部分，第三小组负责磅湛省在湄公河右岸的一部分以及磅同省，第四小组负责嗊吥和茶胶两省，第五小组负责磅清扬和磅士卑两省，第六小组负责马德望和菩萨两省。
    柬埔寨联合停战委员会双方代表团首席代表在地方联合停战小组出发之前，曾召集这些小组的四十多名军官举行会议。
    高棉抗战部队总司令部和越南志愿人员司令部代表团首席代表青山上校在这次会议上追述了越南和柬埔寨两国人民在反对共同敌人、争取民族独立和统一的斗争中的团结一致。青山上校谈到就地复员的工作时，表示希望联合停战委员会的干部将忠实地执行他们的任务，从而使高棉抗战部队能按照日内瓦协定的精神，在柬埔寨的国家生活中享有他们的地位。
    柬埔寨王国军队总司令部代表团首席代表郎诺上校也指出了在越南和柬埔寨两国人民间建立持久友谊的必要性。
   【新华社十六日讯】据越南通讯社十五日讯：柬埔寨联合停战委员会为了更迅速有效地执行它的任务，已决定成立两个小组委员会，负责研究停战协定里所规定的各项问题，其中四项主要的问题是：
    （一）关于停止敌对行动的问题；
    （二）关于释放战俘和被拘平民的问题；
    （三）关于从柬埔寨撤退外国军队的问题；
    （四）关于高棉抗战部队就地复员以及团结在柬埔寨全国共同生活中的问题。
    第一个小组委员会负责研究头两个问题。代表高棉抗战部队总司令部和越南志愿人员司令部的是高桑（柬埔寨东部高棉抗战部队副司令）和阮文华博士等。
    这个小组委员会讨论最多的问题是释放被拘平民的问题。在战争期间，特别是从一九五一年以来，法兰西联邦部队迫使大批柬埔寨平民离乡背井，迁移到法军据点附近过着悲惨的生活。这种集中平民的办法的目的是为了便于在当时进行强迫征兵以及对付高棉抗战部队的活动。因此，这些被集中起来的平民就属于柬埔寨停战协定第八条所规定的被拘平民一类。高棉抗战部队和越南志愿人员的代表们正敦促释放总数约三十万的被集中的平民。
    然而，柬埔寨王国军队总司令部诿称这只是柬埔寨王国的内政，和停战协定的实施无关。它硬说这些平民都是自愿放弃他们的家园和稻田而住在法军据点附近的。讨论正在继续进行中。
    【新华社十六日讯】据越南通讯社北越十五日讯：寮国抗战政府和越南志愿人员司令部的代表们九月十一日在中越北部清化省岑山移交给法兰西联邦部队二百名战俘。这些战俘中包括一百六十二名北非战俘、二十九名欧洲战俘、五名老挝籍战俘和四名越南籍战俘。这些战俘都是一九五三年年底以前在老挝中部被俘的。
    这些战俘在遣返前，写了许多封信给寮国战斗部队的干部、战士和老挝人民，感谢他们的宽待。
