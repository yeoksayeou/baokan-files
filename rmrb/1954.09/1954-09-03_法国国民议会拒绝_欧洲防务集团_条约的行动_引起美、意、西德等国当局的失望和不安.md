Xinhua News Agency, September 1st. The action of the French National Assembly in rejecting the "European Defense Community" treaty has aroused disappointment and unease among the authorities in the United States and Western European countries participating in this treaty.

    U.S. President Eisenhower, speaking in Des Moines, Iowa, on the 30th, admitted that the French National Assembly's decision was "a serious setback" for the U.S. aggressive policy. He said, "France's abandonment of the European Defense Community is a disappointing and heartbreaking thing, and there is no use in glossing over this fact." However, Eisenhower immediately expressed the United States' determination to rearm West Germany, saying that the United States would not "wash its hands" of the matter of rearming West Germany.
    After the news of the French National Assembly's rejection of the "European Defense Community" treaty reached Bonn, West Germany's acting Chancellor Blücher admitted that the news disappointed and shocked him. But he said that "disappointment and shock" did not make the Bonn side give up the idea of militarization, and he hoped that the United States would help them realize this plan.
    When the news of the French National Assembly's rejection of the "European Defense Community" treaty reached Rome, Italian cabinet ministers who were on vacation in various places were urgently recalled to study the current situation. A foreign ministry spokesman said that the vote of the French National Assembly "may be the beginning of the end of the (European Defense Community)."
    The capitals of the treaty participating countries, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, also experienced disappointment and unease over the French National Assembly's decision. Dutch Foreign Minister J. Luns said that the news was "serious"; a Dutch Foreign Ministry spokesman said that it "was very bad news," and that the decision "meant that what we have been striving for for a long time has gone bankrupt." A Belgian government spokesman also expressed "great disappointment." Belgian Honorary Minister of State Roger Motz said: "We are moving in the direction of undermining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." Luxembourg's Foreign Minister Burke also said that the French National Assembly's action was an "unfortunate thing."
    The French newspaper "Le Figaro" published two dispatches from Italy and West Germany on the 31st, pointing out that the French National Assembly's vote result caused "chaos in Rome" and left "Bonn dumbfounded." The dispatches pointed out that these countries are now panicked and "are waiting for new moves from Washington and London."

    法国国民议会拒绝“欧洲防务集团”条约的行动
    引起美、意、西德等国当局的失望和不安
    【新华社一日讯】法国国民议会拒绝“欧洲防务集团”条约后，美国和参与这一个条约的西欧国家的当局表示失望和不安。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔三十日在衣阿华州的得·梅因城发表演说，承认法国国民议会的这一决定是美国侵略政策的“一个严重挫折”。他说：“法国背弃欧洲防务集团是一件令人失望痛心的事情，抹煞这个事实是没有用的。”但是，艾森豪威尔马上又表示了美国要重新武装西德的决心，说美国在重新武装西德这件事上是不会“撒手不干”的。
   法国国民议会拒绝“欧洲防务集团”条约的消息传到波恩后，西德的代理总理布吕希承认这一个消息使他失望和震惊。但是他说“失望和震惊”并没有使波恩方面放弃军国主义化的念头，他希望美国帮助他们实现这一个计划。
   法国国民议会拒绝“欧洲防务集团”条约的消息传到罗马，正在各地休假的意大利内阁部长被紧急召回研究当前的局势。一个外交部发言人说：法国国民议会的这一表决“或许是（‘欧洲防务集团’）完蛋的开始。”
    条约参与国荷兰、比利时、卢森堡的首都，对法国国民议会的这一个决定也引起了失望和不安。荷兰外交大臣约·伦斯说这一个消息是“严重的”；荷兰外交部发言人说这“是一个很坏的消息”，这个决定“意味着我们长久以来竭力争取的东西破产了”。比利时政府发言人也表示“很感失望”。比利时名誉国务大臣罗歇·莫兹说：“我们正在向使北大西洋公约组织瓦解的方向发展着”。卢森堡的外交大臣伯克也说：法国国民议会的行动是一件“不幸的事”。
    法国“费加罗报”三十一日刊载了发自意大利和西德的两篇通讯，通讯指出，法国国民议会的表决结果引起了“罗马的混乱”，使得“波恩目瞪口呆”。通讯指出，这些国家现在惊惶失措，“正在等待着华盛顿和伦敦的新举动”。
