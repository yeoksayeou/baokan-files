Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, September 9th: This reporter reports on the victorious scene of the People's Liberation Army's anti-aircraft artillery units on the Fujian front fiercely striking Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft: On the morning of September 7th, at 4:00 AM, our Xiamen area air defense forces issued an air raid alert. Chiang Kai-shek scraped together 42 sorties of aircraft from Taiwan, Penghu, and other places, divided into two batches, attempting to take advantage of the morning fog to attack our Xiamen area. Just as Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft sneaked into the airspace over our Xiamen area, preparing to dive and bomb and strafe, a series of earth-shattering roars suddenly erupted from our anti-aircraft artillery positions. Thousands of shells were fired at Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft. The shells exploded in the clouds, and a Chiang Kai-shek aircraft that had sneaked into Xiamen's airspace from the southeast immediately burst into flames and crashed into the sea. Several other Chiang Kai-shek aircraft that had sneaked into Xiamen's airspace were also disoriented by our army's dense artillery fire and fled into the distance. Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft that had sneaked into Xiamen's airspace from the east and northeast were also severely attacked by our army's artillery fire. One Chiang Kai-shek aircraft had just dived down from a height of several thousand meters, preparing to drop bombs, when it was immediately hit by our army's shells. The Chiang Kai-shek aircraft hastily dropped its bombs into the sea and on the beach, dragging a wisp of black smoke, and fled close to the sea surface. The rest of Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft were also intercepted by our army's powerful anti-aircraft fire net, their formations were thrown into disarray, and they fled into the clouds to hide. When they once again sneaked out to continue diving towards the rear of our army's positions, they were immediately subjected to fierce attacks by our army's dense firepower. In another location, one Chiang Kai-shek aircraft was caught in our army's fire circle. It lunged left and right, trying to escape, but was immediately hit by a shell and immediately fell from the sky, landing in the sea south of Jinmen Island. The fierce battle lasted for more than three hours. Under the fierce attack of our army's powerful artillery fire, four Chiang Kai-shek aircraft were shot down and twenty were damaged.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, September 9th: The anti-aircraft artillery units of the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front shot down and damaged one Chiang Kai-shek aircraft each that intruded into the airspace over Xiamen Island.

At 23:50 on the 8th, one Chiang Kai-shek aircraft intruded into the airspace over Xiamen Island and fled overseas after being fired upon by our anti-aircraft artillery.

At 1:45 on the 9th, one Chiang Kai-shek B-25 bomber intruded into the airspace over Xiamen Island and dropped two bombs. It fled after being fired upon by our anti-aircraft artillery. At 5:30 on the same day, six Chiang Kai-shek F-47 fighter planes intruded into the airspace over Xiamen Island and dropped four bombs. Our anti-aircraft artillery opened fire fiercely, immediately shooting down and damaging one Chiang Kai-shek aircraft each.

    福建前线我军强大炮火痛击蒋贼飞机情景
    厦门岛我军又击落击伤蒋贼飞机各一架
    【新华社福州九日电】本社记者报道福建前线人民解放军对空射击部队痛击蒋贼飞机的胜利情景说：九月七日清晨四时，我厦门地区防空部队发出了敌机来袭的警报。蒋贼又从台湾、澎湖等地拼凑了四十二架次飞机分成两批飞来，妄图利用晨雾的掩护袭击我厦门地区。正当蒋贼飞机窜入我厦门地区上空，准备俯冲投弹和扫射的时候，我高射炮阵地上忽然传出一阵阵震天的吼声，千百颗炮弹向着蒋贼飞机射去，炮弹在云层中爆炸，从东南方向窜入厦门上空的一架蒋贼飞机立刻中弹冒烟了，它带着火光栽进大海。另外几架窜入厦门上空的蒋贼飞机，也被我军密集的炮火打得昏头转向，向远空逃遁。从正东和东北方向窜入厦门上空的蒋贼飞机，也都遭到我军炮火的痛击。有一架蒋贼飞机刚刚从数千公尺的高空中俯冲下来准备投弹，就立刻被我军炮弹打中了。这架蒋贼飞机慌忙将炸弹丢到海中和沙滩上，尾巴上拖着一缕黑烟贴着海面逃跑。其余的蒋贼飞机也都受到我军威力强大的对空射击火网的截击，队形大乱，纷纷逃进云层躲藏起来。当它们再一次偷偷摸摸地溜出来继续向我军阵地后方俯冲时，又立刻受到我军密集火力的痛击。在另一处地方，有一架蒋贼飞机陷入我军火力圈内，它左突右冲，妄想逃脱，但旋即被炮弹击中了，顿时从空中栽落下来，掉进了金门岛以南的海中。激烈的战斗进行了三个多小时，蒋贼飞机在我军强大炮火痛击下，被击落四架、击伤二十架。
    【新华社福州九日电】福建前线我人民解放军高射炮部队，又击落击伤窜入厦门岛上空蒋贼飞机各一架。
    八日二十三点五十分，蒋贼飞机一架窜入厦门岛上空，遭我高射炮射击后向海外逃走。
    九日一时四十五分，蒋贼B—二十五型轰炸机一架，窜入厦门岛上空投弹二枚，遭我高射炮的射击后逃走。同日五时三十分，蒋贼F—四十七型战斗机六架，又窜入厦门岛上空投弹四枚。我高射炮猛烈开火，当场击落击伤蒋贼飞机各一架。
