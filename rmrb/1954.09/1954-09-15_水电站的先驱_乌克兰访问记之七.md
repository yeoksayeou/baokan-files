    The Pioneer of Hydroelectric Power Stations
    ——A Visit to Ukraine, Part 7
    By Our Correspondent Li He
    "As a result of the vigorous practice of thrift, the funds accumulated for basic construction projects have increased year by year. Thus, it has become possible to start building many giant enterprises, such as the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station...etc." Leaning against the railing of the ship, gazing at the scenery of the Dnieper River, I recalled this sentence written in Chapter 10 of "A Short History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)." The ship we were on, heading south from Kyiv and Cherkasy, was sailing towards Zaporozhye, the location of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station.
    Just as the Volga River nurtured Russia, the Dnieper River nourishes Ukraine. Although the Dnieper River first flows through the territories of Russia and Belarus, the main part is in Ukraine. It runs from north to south through the entire central part of Ukraine, flowing into the Black Sea. Along its banks in Ukraine, large quantities of wheat and cotton are grown. This third largest river in Europe, after the Volga and the Danube, now accompanies us all day, escorting us. The dense forests on both sides form continuous blue embankments. Its light blue waters are usually as calm as a flat lake, but occasionally, when the wind blows, they resemble an inland sea. On the river, we frequently encounter rafts heading south and barges carrying red iron and black coal heading north, all being pushed or towed by steamships.
    After our ship passed Dnipropetrovsk, we entered a wider stretch of the river. Originally, the sixty-five-kilometer section of the river from Dnipropetrovsk to Zaporozhye had many rocky shoals, making it impossible for ships to navigate. Now, however, it has become a reservoir with unobstructed navigation, allowing the entire Dnieper River to flow smoothly to the Black Sea. Its abundant water power is used to solve the electricity supply problem of the southern industrial zone. This was only realized after the Five-Year Plans for socialist industrialization were carried out in the Soviet Union.
    On the second day in Zaporozhye, we went to the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station named after Lenin. The hydroelectric station buildings are on the opposite bank. Our car drove across the long reinforced concrete dam. This magnificent hydroelectric dam cuts off the Dnieper River. Upstream of the dam, the reservoir is filled with river water. Downstream of the dam, during this summer when the water level is low, many piers of the dam body and the reefs of the rocky shoals are exposed outside the water. Zaporozhye, meaning "beside the rocky shoals," was not named without reason.
    We met with the station director, Pavel Ivanovich Ivanov, at the hydroelectric station management office. He took us on a tour of the hydroelectric station. Ivanov said, "The Dnieper Hydroelectric Station is a good place to train cadres. Every year, many university students from all over the Soviet Union come here to study. The scale of the hydroelectric stations currently under construction in various places exceeds this hydroelectric station. However, this hydroelectric station has provided them with a lot of experience." Ivanov spoke of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station's pioneering role, making it impossible not to recall its glorious history.
    Before the completion of the large hydroelectric stations in Kuibyshev, Stalingrad, etc., the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station was still the largest existing hydroelectric station in the Soviet Union and Europe. It was designed and constructed by Soviet experts themselves. Construction began in 1927, partial power generation began in 1932, and full power generation began in 1938. Before the war, its generating capacity was 558,000 kilowatts, and its annual power generation exceeded the total power generation of all of Russia before the revolution. It supplied the industry and cities along the Dnieper River, Krivbass, and Donbas, as well as the countryside, with cheap electricity, ensuring the rapid development of coal mining, iron ore mining, and the steel industry.
    The Dnieper Hydroelectric Station we saw has already been rebuilt after the war. When the Hitler bandits retreated, they destroyed the hydroelectric station. When the Soviet army recovered the hydroelectric station, it also prevented the explosion of more than 360 tons of explosives. In the garden of the hydroelectric station, there still stands a monument to an unknown soldier. This soldier, when recovering the hydroelectric station, selflessly cut the fuse of the explosives, sacrificing himself. According to people, if it were not for the selfless and decisive action of this unknown soldier at that time, the exploding explosives would have caused significant damage to the hydroelectric station and even the entire city.
    The fascist invaders destroyed the hydroelectric station to such an extent that the Americans said that to rebuild it, it would be better to choose another location. The Germans believed that at most it could only restore navigation, and it was impossible to restore power generation. But the Soviets were not afraid of difficulties and began the work of recovery even before the end of the war, under the difficult conditions of a lack of manpower. After three years, in March 1947, the first three turbine generators began generating electricity, and the locks were repaired at the same time. The southern industrial zone once again received a power supply, and the entire Dnieper River was unobstructed for navigation. By June 1950, all the turbine generators had been restored. Now the hydroelectric station generates 650,000 kilowatts, exceeding the pre-war 90,000 kilowatts.
    In the main switchboard and control room of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, hundreds of electrical panels and meters are arranged in a semicircle. They are equivalent to a map of the hydroelectric station. The duty officer can see at a glance the situation of each generator, each transformer, and each circuit, and make adjustments. Many instruments can automatically record and send signals with lights and bells. Therefore, in the face of such complex equipment, we only saw one person sitting at the table in the middle managing it. This young duty engineer graduated from the Moscow Institute of Water Conservancy Technology only a year and a half ago. According to the station director, he is now a skilled person.
    If the main switchboard and control room are the nerve center of the hydroelectric station, then the turbine hall is the heart of the hydroelectric station. The turbine hall of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station is very spacious and clean. A series of huge turbine generators are arranged in a row. Three of them were custom-made from the United States after the war, and six were produced by the Leningrad Stalin Metal Factory. The efficiency of the Soviet-made turbine generators is higher than that of those imported from the United States. The top of the turbine generator is exposed on the upper floor of the hall, higher than a person, like a circular platform with a round tower in the middle. In the machine room on the middle floor, you can see the rotating parts of the machine, such as shafts and grinding discs. On the walls of the middle floor passage, the tools for repairing the machines are hung, and the tool for tightening screws is thicker than a person's arm. The lower floor is the part where the turbine blades receive the impulse of the water flow. The turbine and the generator are thus connected into a whole from bottom to top by a common shaft. The station director said: If the generator starts slowly, it will affect the stability of the power grid. In the past, it took seven minutes to start the machine, but now with the addition of new equipment, it only takes less than two minutes. In the past, when the load was incorrect, the machine would stop automatically; now, when the load is incorrect, not only will this machine stop automatically, but another machine can automatically take over the start.
    The scene of the river water passing through the turbine to the downstream was reflected in our eyes from the south-facing windowsill of the turbine hall. High and low reefs are scattered in the turbulent whirlpools and splashes like rockeries. Flocks of white gulls fly in the sky above the rapids. They occasionally skim over the water and snatch swimming fish. The river water cascading from high to low is the endless, priceless "white coal." The turbine of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station uses river water with a water level difference of 37.3 meters, generating electricity equivalent to 16,000 tons of coal every day and night. The station director said: The power generation cost of such a large-scale hydropower station is eight or nine tenths less than that of a thermal power plant, and the personnel used are five sixths less than that of a thermal power plant.
    We passed through the locks of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station and left Zaporozhye, heading downstream to the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station, which is under construction. I heard that new hydroelectric stations are also being built in the middle reaches of the Dnieper River. The Dnieper River alone contains so much potential power. As long as our motherland realizes socialist industrialization, how many rivers and lakes can we build huge hydroelectric stations on!

    水电站的先驱
    ——乌克兰访问记之七
    本报记者　李何
    “由于厉行节约的结果，积蓄起来供给基本建设工程的资金是逐年增加了。于是就有可能来着手建筑许多巨型企业，如第聂伯水电站……等等。”我倚着轮船的船舷，眺望第聂伯河的景色，想起“苏联共产党（布）历史简要读本”第十章上写的这句话来。我们乘的从基辅、切尔卡斯南下的轮船，正向第聂伯水电站所在地札坡罗什驶去。
    像伏尔加河培育俄罗斯一样，第聂伯河滋养着乌克兰。第聂伯河虽然先流过俄罗斯和白俄罗斯的土地，但主要部分在乌克兰。她由北到南穿过乌克兰整个中部，流到黑海去。她在乌克兰的沿岸地区长着大量小麦和棉花。这条在欧洲仅次于伏尔加河和多瑙河的第三大河，现在整天陪伴着我们，护送着我们。她的两岸浓密的树林，连绵不绝地构成青色的堤防。她的浅蓝的流水，日常安静得犹如一面平湖，偶然风过浪起又像一片内海。在河上不时遇见南下的木筏，北上的载红铁载黑煤的驳船，都是用汽船或推或拖的。
    我们的轮船过了第聂伯彼得罗夫斯克以后，进到更宽阔的河面。原来从第聂伯彼得罗夫斯克到札坡罗什一段六十五公里河流，多石滩，不能行走轮船，现在却变成通航无阻的水库，使整条第聂伯河畅通到黑海，她的丰富水力被用来解决南方工业区的电力供应问题，这只有在苏联进行社会主义工业化的五年计划以后才实现了。
    到札坡罗什的第二天，我们便到以列宁为名的第聂伯水电站去。水电站建筑物在对岸。我们的汽车驶过钢筋混凝土的长堤。这座雄壮的水电站长堤截断了第聂伯河。长堤的上流，水库里蓄满河水。长堤的下流，在这夏天水位较低的时候，多墩的堤身和石滩的暗礁都裸露在水外。来往的轮船经过长堤左边的水闸行走，它们既不受水位的影响，也不怕石滩的威胁。札坡罗什，意思是在石滩旁边，这座城市的起名不是无因的。
    在水电站管理部会见了站长巴维尔·伊凡诺维奇·伊凡诺夫。他带我们参观了水电站。伊凡诺夫说：“第聂伯水电站是培养干部的好地方。全苏联各地每年有不少大学生来这里学习。现在建筑中的各地水电站的规模却超过这个水电站。但是这个水电站供给了它们很多经验。”伊凡诺夫说到了第聂伯水电站的先驱作用，使人不能不回忆起它的光荣历史。
    在古比雪夫、斯大林格勒等等大水电站建成以前，第聂伯水电站仍然是苏联和欧洲现有的最大的水电站。它是由苏联专家自己设计和施工的，它在一九二七年开始建筑，到一九三二年部分发电，到一九三八年全部发电。战前它的发电能力是五十五万八千瓩，每年发电量超过革命前全俄国的发电量。它供应了第聂伯河沿岸，克里沃巴斯、顿巴斯的工业和城市以及乡村以便宜的电力，保证了采煤、采铁和钢铁工业的迅速发展。
    我们看到的第聂伯水电站，已经是战后重建的了。希特勒匪徒败走时炸毁了水电站。苏军收复水电站时还阻止了三百六十多吨炸药的爆炸。在水电站的花园里，至今竖立着一座无名战士的纪念碑。这位战士在收复水电站时，奋不顾身地捻断了炸药导火线，自己却牺牲了。据人们谈，当时如果没有这位无名战士自我牺牲的果敢行动，爆炸起来的炸药，会带给水电站以至全城重大的损失。
    法西斯侵略者把水电站炸毁到这样的程度，美国人说要重建只好另选别处，德国人认为最多只能恢复通航，不可能恢复发电。但苏联人不怕困难，在战争没有结束时就在人力缺乏的困难条件下开始恢复的工作。经过三年，在一九四七年三月，第一批三部透平发电机开始发电，同时修复了水闸。南方工业区又得到电力供应，整个第聂伯河又通航无阻了。到一九五○年六月，全部透平发电机都恢复了。现在水电站发电六十五万瓩，超过战前九万瓩。
    在第聂伯水电站的总电盘和操纵厅，成百电板电表在这里排成半月形。它们等于水电站的地图。值班人从上面一目了然水电站的每一个发电机、每一个变压器和每一线电路的情况，而加以调节。许多仪器能自动记录，以灯亮和铃响发出信号。所以在这样复杂的装置面前，我们只看见一个人坐在当中的桌子前管理。这位年青的值班工程师，一年半之前才从莫斯科水利技术学院毕业。据站长介绍，他现在已经是熟练的人员了。
    如果说总电盘和操纵厅是水电站的神经中枢，那么透平厅就是水电站的心脏。第聂伯水电站的透平厅非常宽敞、干净。一连串排列着许多部巨大的透平发电机。其中三部是战后向美国定造的，六部是列宁格勒斯大林金属制造厂出产的。苏联自制的透平发电机的效率，高过从美国输入的。透平发电机的顶部露在大厅上层，比一个人还高，像一座座中间放着圆塔的圆台。在大厅中层的机器房，才看到轴和磨盘似的机器的转动部分。中层过道壁上，挂着修理机器用的工具，其中起螺丝钉的工具比人的手臂还粗。下层是透平轮叶接受水流冲动的部分。透平和发电机就是这样由下而上，由共同的轴联成整体的。站长说：发电机开动慢了，会影响电网的稳定性。以前开动机器要七分钟，现在添设新式装置，只要不到二分钟。以前负荷不对的时候，机器自动停止；现在负荷不对的时候，不仅这部机器自动停止，而且别部机器能自动接替开动。
    河水通过透平到了下流的景象，从透平厅的朝南窗台，映进了我们的眼帘。高高低低礁石像假山一样散布在湍急的漩涡和水花中。一群群白鸥飞翔在激流的上空。它们不时掠过水面，攫取游鱼。从高处瀑泻到低处的河水，这就是无穷尽的无代价的“白煤”。第聂伯水电站的透平，利用水位差三十七点三公尺的河水，每昼夜发出了相当于一万六千吨煤发出的电力。站长说：这样大规模的水力发电站，发电成本比火力发电厂少十分之八、九，所用人员比火力发电厂少六分之五。
    我们经过第聂伯水电站的水闸离开了札坡罗什，又向在建筑卡霍夫卡水电站的下游进发。听说第聂伯河中游也要建筑新的水电站。仅仅一条第聂伯河就蕴藏着这样多的潜在力量。只要我们祖国实现了社会主义工业化，我们有多么多的江河可以建立巨大的水电站呵！
