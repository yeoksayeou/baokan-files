Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 31st. The British Labour Party delegation, visiting China at the invitation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, held a press conference in Guangzhou on the evening of the 31st to receive Chinese and British journalists. Mr. Philips, the delegation's spokesperson, delivered a statement on behalf of the delegation at the meeting. The full text of the statement is as follows:

    "As we leave China, we would like to express our warm gratitude for the hospitality and welcome we have received in various places. We have been provided with all kinds of conveniences. We have met with government personnel, ministers, and officials whom we wished to meet at any time. We have had a long conversation with Chairman Mao Zedong and several long conversations with Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai. We would like to record our gratitude for the much time that the Premier has spent for us.

    The efforts of the Chinese people to build their country along modern lines have deeply impressed us. We have seen the great efforts made by the Chinese people in the face of the primitive industrial technology they have inherited and the consequences of centuries of social stagnation. We sympathize with the efforts made by the Chinese people in this regard. We believe that this sympathy and understanding should be expressed by the rest of the world in an immediate and practical form. We are deeply aware of the many misunderstandings of each other's positions caused by the lack of contact. We believe that the spokesmen of revolutionary China have a sincere desire to end this isolation. On our part, we express the same desire most sincerely. We believe that the peace of the world depends on closer contact between China and the rest of the world. A policy of exclusiveness can only endanger peace.

    We believe that peaceful coexistence and, on that basis, active cooperation and mutual trade will enhance understanding and bring us all closer together, thereby reducing the danger of war.

    Although there are undoubtedly significant ideological differences between New China and Western democracies, in our view, as in the view of the leaders of the Chinese government, these differences are not an obstacle to peaceful coexistence and to our cooperation in many areas of common interest."

    After issuing the statement, Philips also answered some questions from reporters regarding international peaceful coexistence and promoting Sino-British relations, reiterating the importance of developing international trade and relations. He also said that the delegation would issue a comprehensive statement later.

    英国工党代表团在广州发表声明
    【新华社广州三十一日电】应中国人民外交学会邀请访华的英国工党代表团三十一日晚在广州举行记者招待会，招待中国和英国的记者。代表团发言人菲利浦斯先生在会上发表了代表团的一篇声明。声明全文如下：
    “在我们离开中国的时候，我们愿意对于我们在各地接受的盛情和款待，表示我们热烈的感谢。我们得到了各种各样的方便。我们已会见了在任何时候我们希望会见的政府人员、部长们和官员们。我们曾经与毛泽东主席有过一次长时间的会谈，并与周恩来总理兼外长有过好几次长时间的会谈。我们愿意对于总理为我们花费的许多时间铭志我们的感谢。
    中国人民沿着现代的道路建设他们国家的努力使我们得到深刻的印象。我们看到了中国人民面对着他们所承继的原始的工业技术和许多世纪以来社会停滞的后果所作的伟大努力。我们同情中国人民在这方面所作的努力。我们相信，这种同情和了解应该由世界其他各地以立即的和实际的形式表示出来。我们深深的感到由于缺乏来往所造成的对彼此立场的许多误解。我们相信革命中国的发言人们有终止这种孤立状态的真挚愿望。在我们方面，我们最衷心地表达同样的愿望。我们相信，世界的和平有赖于中国和世界其他各地之间的更密切的交往。排他性的政策只能危害和平。
    我们相信，和平共处以及以此为基础的积极合作和相互贸易，会使了解更加增进，并且使我们大家都更加接近起来，从而减少战争的危险。
    虽然，在新中国和西方的民主国家之间，毫无疑问存在着重大的思想意识的差别，但是在我们看来，正如中国政府领袖们的看法一样，这些差别对于和平共处和对于我们在许多有共同利益的方面进行合作，并不是一种障碍。”
    在发表声明后，菲利浦斯还回答了记者们提出的一些有关国际和平共处和促进中英关系的问题，再次强调了发展国际贸易和来往关系的重要。他还说代表团以后还将发表一个全面的声明。
