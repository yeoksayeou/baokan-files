**Speech by He Xiangning:**

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report.

The first Constitution of the People's Republic of China has been solemnly adopted. This Constitution, of great historical significance, reflects the common will and aspirations of the Chinese people, and also reflects the long-standing wishes of overseas Chinese. It embodies the deep concern and care of the motherland for overseas Chinese. It will undoubtedly inspire the Chinese people to redouble their efforts to build a prosperous and happy socialist society, and it will also promote closer unity among overseas Chinese around the great motherland.

The 12 million overseas Chinese love their motherland. Over the past 50 years, in the Chinese people's revolution to overthrow the feudal imperial system, in the First and Second Chinese Civil Wars, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the Chinese People's Liberation War to thoroughly overthrow imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, many patriotic overseas Chinese participated. The bond between overseas Chinese and the motherland is unbreakable, as it was in the past and will be in the future.

Overseas Chinese have made significant contributions to the economic development and prosperity of their host countries over the years. They do not wish to participate in local political conflicts and do not want to interfere in local politics. What they ask for is to live in harmony with the local people and hope that the governments of their host countries will establish friendly relations with their motherland.

However, the situation of overseas Chinese is very complex. On one hand, the motherland is becoming stronger, and the international status and relations of the motherland are improving and developing. The imperialist war bloc is becoming increasingly isolated, and the international situation is beginning to ease, all of which are beneficial to the improvement of the situation of overseas Chinese. However, the imperialist war bloc, which is hostile to the People's Republic of China, is even more hostile to the Chinese. Therefore, the difficulties faced by overseas Chinese will increase. On the other hand, the motherland is steadily transitioning to a socialist society, but the vast majority of overseas Chinese live in completely different environments. Furthermore, overseas Chinese work abroad, and most of their production resources and property are abroad. However, most of their relatives are in China, and the living expenses of their relatives in China largely depend on the earnings of overseas relatives. This is a complex situation and is a long-term existence. Therefore, in the past five years, the state has considered the special situation of overseas Chinese in protecting the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese, in settling and guiding returned overseas Chinese, and in the policy towards the relatives of overseas Chinese in China. In other words, when the government implements and carries out the general policies and laws of the state, it must consider and formulate various policies related to overseas Chinese as an inseparable part of the state's overall policy.

In recent years, the government's overseas Chinese policy has mainly assisted and guided overseas Chinese in mutual aid and mutual assistance, established cultural and welfare undertakings, promoted friendship and unity among overseas Chinese, and fostered patriotism. At the same time, efforts have been made to promote friendly relations between overseas Chinese and the people of the host countries. In China, appropriate arrangements and guidance have been provided for returned overseas Chinese and difficult overseas Chinese, facilitated remittances, established supplementary schools for returned overseas Chinese students, guided returned overseas Chinese to participate in industrial and agricultural production, and guided the relatives of overseas Chinese in China to participate in various labor and production on a voluntary basis. Assistance has also been provided to relevant departments in formulating regulations on the entry and exit of overseas Chinese to facilitate their travel. At the same time, in important social reform movements, consideration has been given to the actual situation of overseas Chinese and their relatives in China to provide appropriate care. For example, the Central People's Government's State Council formulated the "Regulations on the Handling of Overseas Chinese Land and Property in Land Reform" in 1950; and in the propaganda and education movement for the implementation of the Marriage Law, the Central People's Government's State Council issued the "Regulations on the Handling of Disputes over Marriage Issues of Overseas Chinese."

Fellow representatives, from the above situation, it is not difficult to see that the scope of overseas Chinese affairs is very wide, and many works are partly or entirely related to the business of other government departments. In the past, various levels of overseas Chinese affairs organizations have implemented policies related to overseas Chinese in cooperation and assistance from various government departments to achieve results. Therefore, if there have been some achievements in overseas Chinese work, it is absolutely not just the achievement of the overseas Chinese affairs department, but the result of the joint efforts of various government departments.

However, in the past, we have had shortcomings in overseas Chinese work. Some of our specific policies for overseas Chinese were not formulated in a timely manner, or there were policies but these policies did not meet the broad masses, or they met too late. In the land reform movement, some areas in South China had a tendency to ignore overseas Chinese issues, and our steps to correct these biases were too slow. As a result, some overseas Chinese and their relatives who should have been taken care of did not receive the care they deserved. These biases were basically corrected in the land reform re-examination in 1953. For example, the protection of remittances, the Central Committee for Overseas Chinese Affairs and the People's Bank of China had already formulated specific policies, but until recently, it was found that these policies had not been publicly explained to township and village cadres and relevant groups, and the policies had not been fully disseminated and had not been well communicated to the masses. If there are still individual places where there are phenomena of violating remittance policies, then the main reason is that the policies have not been disseminated and explained, and therefore have not been implemented.

On the other hand, it must be pointed out that some local cadres, and even leaders, have not been willing to face the special nature of overseas Chinese issues, fearing trouble and seeking convenience, and have not been willing to distinguish between complex special issues and general issues, study them, and handle them. This shortcoming and error should also be corrected in future work.

The upcoming National People's Congress will soon produce new state organs. I believe that the new overseas Chinese affairs organizations at various levels established according to the Constitution and the organizational laws of local people's congresses and local people's committees at various levels should strive to promote the unity of overseas Chinese, carry forward the traditional patriotism of overseas Chinese; for returned overseas Chinese in China, appropriate arrangements should be made as much as possible, and they should be guided and organized to accept socialist education and reform, and appropriate and necessary care should be given according to their different situations. Overseas Chinese affairs organizations must actively serve overseas Chinese, returned overseas Chinese, and relatives of overseas Chinese in China, overcome bureaucratism and indifference to the vital interests of overseas Chinese.

Currently, the major issues that need to be addressed in overseas Chinese work include the issue of overseas Chinese nationality, which Premier Zhou has already mentioned, and I will not repeat it here. I only add one sentence to confirm the principle pointed out by Premier Zhou in the government work report regarding the issue of overseas Chinese nationality, that is, overseas Chinese are also very concerned about the proper resolution of the issue of overseas Chinese nationality. Next, regarding the issue of remittances, it is suggested that the government take effective measures to order relevant regions and departments to ensure that the remittance policy is implemented in earnest. Third, in addition to continuing to guide overseas Chinese to return to China to participate in industrial production, it is welcome for overseas Chinese to develop mountains, wastelands, and forests in various places in China, plant agricultural gardens, establish ranches, and build a large number of houses and cultural and educational undertakings. Doing so is beneficial to overseas Chinese and helps the socialist construction of the state.

After the Kuomintang bandits fled the mainland, they, under the protection of American imperialism, have been stationed in Taiwan Province and have been carrying out sinister activities to harm overseas Chinese, deceiving overseas Chinese of their money, and forcing overseas Chinese to be cannon fodder. They are doing all kinds of evil. Overseas Chinese, in order to reduce the harm they suffer from the Kuomintang bandits, all hope that the motherland will liberate Taiwan as soon as possible and eliminate the Kuomintang traitorous clique.

The situation of overseas Chinese abroad is difficult. In places where the Kuomintang bandits openly carry out activities to harm overseas Chinese, the situation of overseas Chinese is even more difficult. But the hearts of overseas Chinese are still patriotic. The people and government of the motherland are deeply concerned about the situation of overseas Chinese in these places and understand their difficulties. The Kuomintang bandits who fled to overseas countries are driven by American imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits to do evil and have done many bad things. We must advise them to immediately stop all activities to harm overseas Chinese. Do not follow the enemy of the Chinese people, Chiang Kai-shek, any longer. Today, under the great call of the people of the motherland, as long as they can repent and turn to good, stop their evil deeds in overseas Chinese, the people of the motherland and the broad overseas Chinese will allow them to turn to the light and return to their homeland to reunite with their families.

Fellow representatives can see from here that our overseas Chinese work is closely related to the sacred cause of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Kuomintang traitorous clique; and also see that the domestic overseas Chinese work is closely related to the overseas Chinese work. Domestic overseas Chinese work is closely related to the patriotic unity of overseas Chinese. Every measure of domestic overseas Chinese work will directly affect overseas Chinese work; either promoting the patriotic unity of overseas Chinese, blocking the loopholes for the Kuomintang traitorous clique to carry out activities to disrupt the unity of overseas Chinese; or it will affect the unity of overseas Chinese, giving the Kuomintang traitorous clique an opportunity to disrupt the unity of overseas Chinese.

All this shows the importance of the task of state overseas Chinese work, and we overseas Chinese workers and relevant departments must attach sufficient importance to overseas Chinese work, work even more diligently, and redouble our efforts to do a good job in domestic and overseas overseas Chinese work.

Finally, I hope everyone will pay more attention to overseas Chinese work and give guidance.

**Speech by Bao Erhan:**

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully support Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report. Since the liberation of Xinjiang, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, equality among all nationalities and unprecedented unity among nationalities have been achieved, and this unity is becoming more consolidated and continuously developing.

The various nationalities living in the big family of the motherland, over the past five years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, with the help of the great Han nationality, have successfully completed land reform and various democratic reform movements, and carried out various construction work. In 1953, compared to 1949, the cultivated land area of agriculture increased by 29.29%, the grain yield increased by 59.63%, and the number of livestock increased by 32.33%. Currently, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in rural areas is steadily developing, and water conservancy construction is continuing. In the past, Xinjiang had no modern industry. In the past five years, we have built steel mills, machine manufacturing plants, automated power plants, automobile repair plants, cotton textile mills, silk mills, flour mills, coal mines, cement plants, and other enterprises. While developing agriculture and animal husbandry and industry, transportation, internal and external trade, as well as cultural and health undertakings have also made significant progress. With the development of various construction undertakings, local financial revenue and expenditure have almost balanced, and the material and cultural living standards of the various nationalities have also improved significantly. The above achievements not only changed the old face of Xinjiang but also created favorable conditions for the various nationalities of Xinjiang to work together with the people of the whole country to successfully complete the state's transitional period's overall task. The people of Xinjiang have deeply experienced that only in the unified big family of the motherland, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, can they enjoy such a happy life and move towards an even better future. The people of the whole region love our great motherland, the Communist Party of China, and Chairman Mao with boundless love.

In the past five years, we have also made many mistakes and shortcomings in our work. Currently, the main problems are the existence of bureaucratism and commandism, frequent deviations in policy implementation, and the lack of timely and in-depth inspections and supervision by leading organs on certain work. The financial and economic work of Xinjiang Province has not yet been on track, the political and ideological leadership of financial and economic work is insufficient, some state-owned enterprises still have capitalist management styles, and the training of financial and economic cadres of various nationalities has not been done enough, and the phenomenon of wasting and damaging state property still occurs. Although the various nationalities have united unprecedentedly, there are still tendencies of great nationalism and local nationalism in some places and among some cadres. We are making the greatest efforts to correct and overcome these shortcomings and errors and hope that the central government will regularly send people to inspect and assist in the work. In the future, we will more closely unite around the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, be humble and prudent, and follow the direction indicated by the Constitution of the People's Republic of China to strive for the continued consolidation of the unity of our great motherland, the strengthening of national unity, the vigorous support for the liberation of Taiwan, and the building of our country into a prosperous and happy socialist society.

**Speech by Zhang Zhirou:**

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report. I would like to add a few words about general education as a supplement.

Under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government, with the support of the people of the whole country and the efforts of educational workers of the whole country, China's general education has achieved unprecedented development over the past five years.

According to statistics from 1953, there were 51.5 million primary school students nationwide, 2.959 million ordinary middle school and agricultural and industrial accelerated middle school students, 36.9 million normal school students, and 3.9 million higher normal school students. These figures have far exceeded the highest figures in the history of the old China.

Minority education has also developed significantly. According to statistics from 1953, the number of primary schools for national minorities nationwide has developed to 26,436, with 2,546,600 students; 275 middle schools, with 163,300 students. In various national minority schools, the language of the respective nationality is used for teaching. Some national minorities do not yet have a written language, and the people's government is helping them to create one.

All levels of schools have implemented the policy of education serving workers and peasants, and all levels of schools have tried to provide convenient conditions for the children of workers and peasants to enter school. Now, the children of workers and peasants have become the majority or a large part of the students in primary schools, middle schools, and normal schools. To quickly cultivate talents of workers and peasant origin, we have also established agricultural and industrial accelerated middle schools, and now a large number of cadres and industrial workers of workers and peasant origin have entered these schools to study.

Over the past five years, we have carried out a series of reforms in the education system, education content, and teaching methods, and carried out revolutionary political and ideological education among students at all levels of schools, and carried out ideological reform among teachers. These have achieved great results, and the quality of education has been continuously improving.

However, our shortcomings are still many, mainly the low quality of education. First of all, political and ideological education at all levels of schools is still very weak, and the phenomenon of neglecting labor education is particularly serious. Many middle school and primary school students, after graduation, only want to continue their studies and do not want to engage in labor production. Some schools pay insufficient attention to discipline education, resulting in the phenomenon of lax discipline among students. Secondly, the cultural and scientific knowledge level of students is still not high, and many senior high school and junior high school graduates who took the college entrance examination and middle school entrance examination in recent years still have many who failed. In addition, the health condition of teachers and students is not good enough. Although there have been improvements in this regard over the past few years, the poor health of teachers and students is still a relatively serious problem.

Of course, these shortcomings have certain historical roots. The educational foundation left by the old China is very weak, and the ideological influence left by the old society's education is also very deep; but the main reason is that our work is not done well. The Ministry of Education did not pay enough attention to political and ideological education, especially did not conduct a systematic and profound criticism of the ideology of despising manual labor and despising manual laborers, which is a serious mistake. In addition, we lack specific and planned leadership in teaching work, textbook compilation, and teacher learning. In a period of time, we also had the deviation of blindly rushing forward in education development. These are what the Ministry of Education should continue to deeply reflect on and work hard to correct.

In the future, general education must adapt to the needs of national construction and actively and steadily develop on the basis of production development. First of all, it is necessary to develop senior high schools and complete middle schools to meet the needs of higher education to cultivate talents for national construction; secondly, it is necessary to develop junior high schools and primary schools in a planned and focused manner, especially in large cities and industrial areas, to appropriately meet the cultural needs of the people. However, the key to the overall development of education is the teacher problem, so the development of normal education, especially higher normal education, is our most important task.

However, the country is currently concentrating its efforts on industrial construction and cannot allocate more financial, material, and human resources to develop middle schools and primary schools on a larger scale; therefore, in the next relatively long period of time, only a small part of middle school and primary school graduates will be able to continue their studies, and the majority will have to engage in industrial and agricultural production after graduation. This is absolutely necessary for the development of industry and agriculture in the current stage.

In the entire work of general education and normal education, we must pay special attention to improving the quality of education. This requires us to seriously implement the policy of comprehensive development. First of all, we must strengthen political and ideological education to educate young people and children with socialist ideology, so that they can have a socialist political direction, a dialectical materialist worldview, and communist moral qualities. Currently, we should focus on patriotic education and collective education, especially to correctly strengthen labor education and discipline education. We must make students establish a socialist attitude towards labor and labor, fully understand that "labor is the honorable thing for all labor-capable citizens of the People's Republic of China," and establish the idea of loving labor and loving the laboring people. We must also make students deeply understand that the Constitution, laws, and various disciplines of New China are extremely important weapons for the people's government to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, guarantee citizens' rights and safety, and ensure the development of production and various construction undertakings. Every patriotic citizen "must abide by the Constitution and laws, abide by labor discipline, abide by public order, and respect social public morality." Every student must abide by the rules and disciplines of the school, cultivate the habit of law-abiding. However, to implement the above-mentioned policies, in addition to school education, it is also necessary for student parents and social figures to work together with the school to educate the new generation with socialist ideology.

The primary task of improving teaching at present is to use socialist ideology and advanced scientific knowledge to formulate and revise the teaching outlines and textbooks of various levels of schools, correspondingly improve teaching methods, and improve the political level and professional level of in-service teachers. We must also effectively overcome the heavy workload of teachers and students and the current chaotic situation in school work.

In addition, we must take effective measures to further improve the health of teachers and students, continue to implement Chairman Mao's instructions of "good health, good study, good work" and the State Council's "Decision on Improving the Health Condition of Students at Various Levels of Schools."

Over the past few years, the hard work of educational workers across the country has achieved great results. In the future, with the continuous development of the national economy, the development of China's general education will be very magnificent, and our work tasks will be even more arduous. We believe that under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, with the support and assistance of the people of the whole country, all of us educational workers will continue to strengthen unity, overcome difficulties, and give full play to our enthusiasm and creativity to complete the glorious and great task of cultivating socialist new people entrusted to us by the motherland and the people.

**Speech by Zeng Xisheng:**

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report.

Over the past five years, there have been great achievements in all aspects and regions of the country, and Anhui is no exception. However, I do not intend to elaborate on the overall work, I only want to say a few words about the production and disaster relief work that the people of Anhui are most grateful for, that the people of the whole country are most concerned about, and that is still a relatively arduous task at present.

Anhui is located between the Yangtze River and the Huai River and is a province prone to disasters. According to historical records, from 246 BC to 1948, approximately two thousand years, there were 979 major and minor floods. According to investigations by the people over the past few years, in the past hundred years, there has been a small disaster every five years, a major disaster every ten years, and a continuous disaster every thirty years. During the period of Kuomintang rule, due to the neglect of water conservancy, the digging of the Yellow River into the Huai River, the situation of "small rain, small disaster, big rain, big disaster, no rain, drought disaster" became a serious phenomenon of annual disasters. Everyone still remembers: in 1949, the Yangtze and Huai rivers both flooded, five floods in five years, eight million people suffered from disasters; in 1950, the Huai River suffered a severe flood, nearly ten million people suffered from disasters; in 1951, it was the best year, but there were still two to three hundred thousand acres of waterlogging and drought disasters; in 1952, although there was no flood, waterlogging reached more than 15 million acres, and 5.7 million people suffered from disasters; in 1953, although waterlogging and drought were relatively light, an unexpected frost disaster suddenly struck; this year's flood is unprecedented in a hundred years, but the disaster situation in the Huai River area has been greatly reduced due to the effect of flood control, but the disaster situation in the Yangtze River area is very serious, many high-yield crop areas have been completely lost due to deep water or dyke breaches. This is the general situation of the serious disaster in Anhui.

Although this is the case, we have overcome this serious disaster. The reason we can overcome it is, first of all, because the Central People's Government and the people of the whole country have given us tremendous material support. From 1949 to 1953, the Central Government allocated a total of 150 billion yuan of relief grain and various materials to Anhui. Especially this year, the Central Government has supported us with greater strength, first by investing a large amount of materials in flood control and rescue, and then by providing a large amount of grain and seeds, tents, and other materials to relieve the disaster-stricken people. When transportation by car is not enough, it is followed by air transportation, so not only do the disaster-stricken people receive relief, but they are also helped to solve many production difficulties. Secondly, because the Central Government formulated the policy of "production self-reliance," so over the past few years, although we have suffered serious disasters year after year, agricultural production has still increased year by year. In 1949, the total output of the province was only 9.1 billion jin, in 1950 it increased to 10.1 billion jin, in 1951 it increased to 17.3 billion jin; in 1952, although the disaster situation was more serious than in 1951, the output still increased to 17.6 billion jin; in 1953, although the disaster situation was more serious than in 1952, the output increased again to 17.9 billion jin. This year, although the flood is unprecedented in a hundred years, due to the strengthening of field management in non-disaster areas and the adoption of measures such as draining water, replanting, eliminating fallow land, cultivating regenerated rice, regenerated sorghum, and mixed planting, the output can still reach about 15 billion jin, which is 12.8% higher than the highest output before liberation. At the same time, due to the development of various sideline productions and the expansion of vegetable planting areas, income from various aspects has been increased for the disaster-stricken people, so we have overcome the serious disasters over the past few years and accumulated production experience in disaster-prone areas. Thirdly, because the Central Government made the decision to "definitely improve the Huai River," large-scale projects have been built along the Huai River, especially in the middle reaches, which not only eliminated small disasters caused by small rains and reduced large disasters caused by large rains, but also increased the conditions for increased production. For example, the Su County area in northern Anhui, which has always been a disaster-prone area in Anhui, still has the possibility of increased production in the unprecedented flood situation this year, which is a clear test.

The people of Anhui say: "In the past few years, without clothes, we were given clothes, without grain, we were given grain, without straw, we were given coal, when we were sick, we were given medicine, and we were also helped with production tools and fertilizers, guided in production technology, and at the same time, the Huai River was treated well to ensure production. The people's government is truly warmer than the winter sun and closer than parents." They also say: "The suffering of the reactionaries is endless; the kindness of Chairman Mao is unforgettable for eight generations." Here, let me, on behalf of the people of Anhui, express our heartfelt thanks to the people of the whole country, and express our highest respect to the Central People's Government and the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao!

Because of the correct leadership and support of the Communist Party of China led by Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, and because of the encouragement and assistance of the people of the whole country, we have completely overcome the various disasters from 1949 to 1953 and have achieved the requirement of disaster relief without starvation, which is something that no other dynasty in history could achieve. From this, we can also be sure that we will be able to overcome the disasters of this year even better. However, we will not be complacent. We deeply know that not only is the elimination of disasters a long-term and arduous task, but in the past few years of production and disaster relief work, there are still many serious shortcomings and errors. For example, in the masses and grassroots cadres, because of the continuous disasters over the years, there has been a sense of unease, and because of the continuous disaster relief, there has been a sense of dependence, which has not been completely overcome; because the disaster situation is not grasped in reality, there have been phenomena of disproportionate relief in the distribution of relief grain and funds, and even the phenomenon of embezzlement or over-receipt of relief grain and funds has not been completely eliminated; because of the development of sideline production, there has been a tendency to increase the spontaneous capitalist forces, which has not been prevented in advance. All these phenomena are inseparable from the existence of certain bureaucratic work styles in our leadership, such as insufficient education, insufficient inspection, and unclear instructions. I deeply feel that to do a good job in various work, especially in disaster situations, we must review Chairman Mao's works, learn Chairman Mao's work methods, and especially remember Chairman Mao's instructions in the opening speech of this conference: "Be honest, diligent, and hardworking, encourage and help each other, and strictly avoid any boasting and arrogance." I believe that as long as we can act according to the Constitution and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, we will definitely be able to complete the task of socialist construction and socialist transformation, and definitely be able to complete the task of overcoming disasters and conquering nature.

**Speech by Deng Chumin:**

When I stand on this solemn podium to express my heartfelt support for Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, I cannot help but think of the stark contrast between the political, economic, cultural, and spiritual and moral faces of our country over the past five years and those of the old China; and I cannot help but think of the great Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, who have led us through countless hardships to achieve victory in the democratic revolution and are now leading us towards victory in the socialist revolution. On September 20, 1954, this unforgettable day, the first session of the First National People's Congress adopted the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, which guarantees the fruits of the people's revolution and builds a socialist society. With this Constitution, the people of our country have a powerful weapon and will be more confident in striving to build socialism! Our task now is to strictly abide by and implement this Constitution, to do everything according to the Constitution, and to make it the standard for our actual actions. After listening to Premier Zhou's report, I, as a local government worker and a people's representative, would like to express some immature opinions.

Over the past five years, the people of Shanxi, like the people of the whole country, have successfully completed the various tasks assigned to them by the state during the period of economic recovery under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao. The industry and agriculture of Shanxi have suffered extremely severe destruction in the long-term wars, but in just five years, in the field of industry, through a series of democratic and production reforms, they have achieved rapid recovery and development. By the end of 1953, the total industrial output value of the province had increased by five times compared to 1949. 1953 was the first year of the implementation of the first five-year construction plan of our country. In Shanxi, many key construction projects of the state are being built, and some have already started production. In 1953, the total industrial output value of the province, including modern industry and workshop handicrafts, increased by 32% compared to 1952. The total industrial output value of state-owned and locally state-owned industries, which are of a socialist nature, has reached more than 75% of the total industrial output value of modern industry and workshop handicrafts. The total industrial output value of state-owned and locally state-owned industries in 1954 is expected to increase by about 30% compared to 1953, and we will strive to achieve actual results of increased production and savings not lower than the profit increase of last year, reaching 44 billion yuan.

In the field of agriculture, significant achievements have also been made. In 1952, the total grain output of the province increased by 48% compared to 1949, and in 1953, it increased by 13% compared to 1952. This year, despite the floods and waterlogging in some areas, it is estimated that the output can still increase by about 6% compared to last year. Since last winter, after vigorously promoting the state's overall task during the transitional period, the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement has made a leap forward. By the end of June 1954, Shanxi had more than 10,000 agricultural production cooperatives, which is 4.5 times that of last year; the number of cooperative households accounts for 9.6% of the total number of households in the province, and the total number of households participating in agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams has reached 70% of the total number of households in the province. It is estimated that by 1955, the number of households participating in agricultural production cooperatives in the province will reach about 35% of the total number of households in the province.

With the development of industry and agriculture, other economic construction and cultural and educational undertakings have also developed accordingly, and the material and cultural living standards of the people have also improved to a certain extent. All these facts prove that Premier Zhou's report is completely in line with the actual situation, and the policies and guidelines of the Central People's Government over the past five years are completely correct. At the same time, it also proves that the people's democratic system led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants has great superiority.

Of course, there are still many shortcomings and errors in our work. In terms of my responsibility for the cultural and educational and health departments of Shanxi, the implementation of the central policy of uniting and transforming intellectuals is not enough, and the implementation of the policy of uniting traditional and Western medicine and improving environmental sanitation is also not enough. The construction period requires the participation of intellectuals in all aspects. Shanxi is culturally backward and lacks intellectuals, but many of our leading organs often have two tendencies of neglecting unity and transformation and indulgence at the same time in dealing with intellectuals, which is not conducive to the construction of all aspects and must be paid attention to and corrected with great efforts. I myself am also an intellectual. In the past few years, after coming into contact with some practical work, I have deeply felt that I, as Chairman Mao said, can only be considered a half-intellectual. I have not undergone rigorous revolutionary struggle training, nor do I have practical work experience. I thought I knew a little Marxism-Leninism theory, but I often could not connect it with reality. Once I came into contact with practical problems, my tendency of empty talk and dogmatism was exposed. Therefore, I not only failed to do a good job in the cultural and educational department I am responsible for, but also as a member of a democratic party, I have shortcomings in the work of the united front. What is comforting is that my relationship with colleagues, superiors and subordinates, and the masses is good, and it is getting better every day. Here, I deeply feel the correctness of the Communist Party's united front policy. At the same time, I deeply feel that the ideological transformation of an intellectual must first solve the problem of the disconnection between theory and practice, and the key to solving this problem is to thoroughly criticize and overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology. My shortcomings lie in the fact that I have not estimated and checked the influence of bourgeois ideology and petty-bourgeois ideology on myself enough. This is reflected in: setting the standard for myself too high, often excusing myself with illness and old age. What is bourgeois ideology, petty-bourgeois ideology? Selfishness and wanting to gain a little advantage, arrogance and wanting to save face, consciously or unconsciously making personal plans, caring more about personal matters than public matters, caring more about others than oneself, not adhering to principles in the face of issues that harm the interests of the people and the state, liberalism in discovering one's own and others' errors and shortcomings, and not being willing to actively carry out criticism and self-criticism. These erroneous ideas, if not thoroughly eliminated in the process of socialist transformation, will not be able to take on the responsibilities entrusted by the state and the people. Over the past few years, although I have been subjectively eager to do a good job, in reality, as a government worker, I have not fulfilled my duties. This has always been a heavy burden on my mind. Now, I have been trusted and entrusted by the people to be a representative of the First National People's Congress, and this burden has become even heavier. However, I have lived to the great and glorious era of Mao Zedong, and the era does not allow me to be self-abandoned. Seeing everyone's progress, I envy it, and seeing my own shortcomings, I hate it. Therefore, I have made the decision not just once to open a battlefield in my mind to fight against the erroneous ideas that exist. But because I lack the spirit of self-criticism, my progress is slow.

The convening of the First National People's Congress marks a new stage in the people's democratic system. I am honored to be among them and must guarantee to the Congress: to study Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China and Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, and to guarantee to implement the spirit of these two reports: to strictly abide by the Constitution and all laws, to be loyal to the people's democratic system, to serve the people wholeheartedly, to be a sincere and honest servant of the people. At the same time, under the cultivation of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, to carry out thorough ideological transformation, to overcome the errors and shortcomings in my work; to guarantee to contribute all my strength to the socialist construction of the motherland, to the struggle for the liberation of Taiwan, and to the cause of world peace.

**Speech by Yang Tingbao:**

I feel happy and excited that the First National People's Congress solemnly adopted the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and several other important laws, and the revolutionary achievements and socialist construction direction of our country are thus firmly established!

After listening to Premier Zhou's report, I fully support it. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, on the basis of the broken remnants left by the reactionaries, we have not only quickly completed the work of sorting out and restoring order, but have also begun large-scale economic construction with a plan. Under the guidance of the overall task of the transitional period, socialist construction and socialist transformation are being gradually realized. The victory in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea has smashed the enemy's sabotage plot and strengthened our national defense forces. After the Geneva Conference, our international status has been unprecedentedly enhanced, and the momentum of the peace forces is growing stronger, which provides more favorable conditions for the industrialization of our country and increases the guarantee for our socialist construction. Nowadays, all over the country, everywhere is full of the atmosphere of construction, and everywhere is engaged in basic construction. This is truly exciting for an architect.

Looking back at the period of reactionary rule, how difficult it was for us architects. From the moment we graduated from the architecture department, we were threatened with unemployment. It was not easy to find an internship opportunity. The few architects in the country often could not find work, let alone create architectural art. A few architectural firms, if they were lucky enough to get a project, would often stop at the design stage and file it away. Some people, in despair, changed their profession. After liberation, with the development of various constructions, talents are needed everywhere. Students are assigned to work as soon as they graduate, and there is still a shortage of supply. Experienced architects are even busier, and they cannot keep up. Many people who changed their profession have returned to the team. We who are responsible for teaching tasks only regret that we do not have the ability to "multiply beans into soldiers" to supply the talents needed by the country in the field of architecture. In the old society, the work of architects was mostly to design and build some scattered buildings for the enjoyment of a few people; after liberation, it is large-scale public buildings or groups of buildings for the service of the masses. Moreover, in the design process, we are no longer controlled by the personal likes and dislikes of the customers, but proceed with the attitude of the master to create architectural art.

In the short five years since the liberation of our country, significant achievements have been made in the fields of architecture and urban planning. However, the tasks are heavy, and talents are insufficient; and the tasks assigned to various institutions to architects are still not balanced in terms of urgency. Design and construction are often not well coordinated. Some urban constructions have not been fully implemented in a planned, step-by-step, and focused manner. Generally, the architecture profession is set up in engineering colleges, but the special nature of its comprehensive applied sciences and applied arts is often not taken care of. In order to meet the requirements of the state's overall task in the transitional period, to better use talents, improve efficiency, and closely integrate actual work, teaching work, and research work, it seems appropriate to establish an architecture college in the capital, concentrate a considerable number of architectural talents, and be led by the central government. In addition to solving some important architectural problems in the capital, it can also support the solution of special architectural problems in various places in a focused and flexible manner.

As an architect, I realize that architectural work is an important link in general basic construction, and the responsibility is great. Architectural creation reflects society. The national form and socialist content are the direction of our architectural creation; but it is not to mechanically imitate some old architectural styles, to use a lot of paint and decorations, and to think that the job is done. I have made this mistake and also made the mistake of structuralism. The root cause is that I have not studied enough. To do a good job in this work, we must study hard, continue to transform our thoughts, eliminate one-sided views and individualism in architectural work, cooperate with comrades in related fields, and strive together to complete the socialist construction ahead of schedule!

**Speech by Zhang Naiqi:**

Fellow representatives:

I fully agree with Premier Zhou's report and the speeches of other leading comrades. Now I would like to supplement some information and opinions regarding the grain work.

1. Over the past five years, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government, relying on our own strength and learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, we have achieved great victories on the grain front.

Everyone will remember that after the liberation of various places, we first faced a serious grain problem. The Chinese people believe that they have enough strength to solve their own problems. Therefore, the policy of grain operation from the beginning was: to fully tap the potential of grain, to unify the grain allocation of the whole country, to ensure military and civilian food, to stabilize grain prices, and to create favorable conditions for the recovery and development of the national economy.

The state vigorously organized the procurement work, purchased the surplus grain of farmers at a fair price, including a large amount of surplus grain in remote areas that private individuals could not transport and farmers could not sell in the past, known as "dead corner grain" and "difficult-to-transport grain." Thus, the phenomena of "abundant harvest leading to disaster" and "low grain prices harming farmers" have disappeared forever. The state also organized the unified transportation of the country, transported grain to places where it is needed, sold it to consumers at a fair price, and supplied the army and state workers. The state maintained the stability of grain prices throughout the year, narrowed the gap between urban and rural grain prices, basically eliminated the phenomenon of grain price surges during the period of food shortage, and restricted the exploitation of private merchants. This has played a significant role in improving people's lives, stabilizing prices, and promoting the enthusiasm for industrial and agricultural production.

The flood in 1949 was quite large. The state transported grain from remote areas to support the disaster areas, and together we overcame the disaster.

We have reversed the trend of relying on foreign rice and wheat imports for more than fifty years. Since 1951, rice and wheat have even had a small amount of exports. The export figures of various grains are not large, only accounting for about 1% of the total output, and the vast majority are soybeans. This is necessary for the industrial construction of the state and is completely possible.

2. The Central Grain Department was established in September 1952, followed by the unification of grain organizations across the country, and the concentration of strength was further enhanced. Starting from the spring of 1953, the situation has changed significantly. The way of using the free market to fight, which was effective in the past, began to encounter difficulties from the grassroots level. Originally, the improvement of people's lives first requires more grain; individual farmers also have some savings, first of all, they want to store more grain. The existence of the free market has made this situation become widespread speculation. At that time, we also encountered some water and drought disasters and the worst frost disaster in several decades. Rich peasants and merchants took the opportunity to collude with small traders, on the one hand, to compete with farmers to buy grain, on the other hand, to mix in the crowd in need of grain to resell state grain, causing many grassroots grain sales points to run out of stock, causing a black market, and promoting the development of farmers' hoarding mentality. Reflected in the overall procurement and sales figures, it is the phenomenon of less procurement and more sales becoming increasingly serious, and the state's grain reserves are consumed more and more. In large and medium-sized cities, the grain market is generally stable, but the amount of grain flowing back to rural areas is increasing.

This situation is not accidental. This is a problem that we must inevitably encounter as we move towards a socialist society and enter the planned era. The essence of the problem is the reflection of the contradiction between the state's planned economy and the small peasant economy and the free market, the reflection of the contradiction between the road of socialist industrialization and the spontaneous forces of farmers and the capitalist road of restricting the bourgeoisie; ultimately, it is the reflection of the contradiction between socialist factors and capitalist factors. The problem is so fundamental that the method of solving the problem must start from the root. The state, in addition to vigorously promoting the cooperativization and technological improvement of agriculture to increase grain production, must also implement the policy of planned procurement and planned supply of grain in the circulation sector, that is, the policy of unified procurement and unified sales and market management, to eliminate grain speculation and overcome grain waste.

Since the new policy began to be implemented in November last year, under the great influence of the propaganda and education of the overall task of the state in the transitional period, due to the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the people's government, the efforts of all cadres, and the active support of the broad masses of the people, the overall situation has been quickly reversed. The procurement figures have increased, and the procurement figures from July 1953 to June 1954 (grain year) have increased by 77.78% compared to the previous year. The inventory at the end of June this year has increased by 51% compared to the same period last year; the private grain industry has been transformed; state grain markets have been established in various places to supplement the lack of unified procurement and unified sales. The unified procurement and unified sales of grain have also played a role in promoting the cooperativization of agriculture and the enthusiasm of farmers' production. With these victories, we have enough strength to cope with the water disaster this year.

The work of unified procurement and unified sales of grain and market management is a series of very heavy and complex work. The procurement work faces a vast number of farmers, the vast majority of whom are individual farmers. The supply work needs to guarantee the full ration of the population living in cities, towns, industrial areas, and the partial ration of the population living in economic crop areas, grain-deficient areas, and disaster areas; in addition, it is necessary to appropriately meet the needs of the catering industry, the copying industry, and the floating population, and to appropriately take care of feed and seed adjustment. However, we started this series of work last year under the conditions of having no experience and being in a hurry and not being fully prepared, so many shortcomings and errors have occurred. In the procurement, there have been phenomena of forced commands, and there have also been phenomena of being tied up and not actively implementing state laws; at the same time, there have been phenomena of less procurement and more procurement, and more procurement and less procurement in various places. In the supply, many places have phenomena of insufficient and excessive supply, untimely supply, etc. Some places have overly complicated supply procedures; some places have insufficient supply to the catering industry, the copying industry, and the floating population. Many places have not combined procurement and supply well, and have been busy with procurement and neglected supply. Some places have unreasonable distribution of procurement points and supply points, either too dense or too sparse. Some places have phenomena of being too loose and too tight in the grasp of grain inspection grades, and some are too loose and some are too tight. Many places do not recognize the role of the state grain market, do not clearly recognize that it is an indispensable assistant to the policy of unified procurement and unified sales, and at the same time, it can only be an assistant. Therefore, some places have unreasonable or insufficient distribution of markets; market management also has phenomena of being too loose and too tight, and many markets have not played their due role. Some private merchants and peddlers still have illegal activities, and some private consignment stores also have illegal and passive behaviors.

The main reason for the above shortcomings and errors is that we do not have a good grasp of the grain situation, and the grain situation of the vast number of farmers is very complex. This also shows that the leadership ability of our Central Grain Department is still very poor, and therefore the business level of various grain departments across the country is still far from meeting the requirements of the objective situation. Now, this aspect of work is being continuously improved. I believe that by gradually summarizing experience, intensifying the training of cadres, and strengthening survey and statistics work, with the development of agricultural cooperativization, the work can be gradually improved to perfection.

3. Over the past five years, grain production has increased year by year, but it is still not enough to meet the growing needs of the state and the people. Therefore, in a relatively long period of time, the supply and demand situation of grain will still be very tight. Experience has proven that by implementing the policy of unified procurement and unified sales of grain and market management, promoting thrift, grain is still enough. The work of unified procurement and unified sales must gradually formulate clear and specific systems, and must actively improve the correctness of the plan, so that the working cadres and the people can act according to the system and the plan. This is exactly what the Constitution requires of us.

The liberation of Taiwan is a historical task of the Chinese people, and this is a complicated and arduous struggle. We must be prepared to ensure the supply of military and civilian food in any situation and continue to stabilize grain prices. We will definitely be able to complete this glorious task.

This year, we have encountered a rare flood in more than a hundred years, although some areas have been affected by the disaster, but the vast non-disaster areas have had a bumper harvest, and the grain production of the whole country can still increase compared to last year, and the grain source is not lacking. To support the disaster areas, the state will strengthen the procurement and transportation work, but due to the significant changes in the production and sales balance between regions and the proportion between grain varieties, there are many difficulties in scheduling. Therefore, it is necessary to rely on the thrift of the people of the whole country; in order to facilitate the state's scheduling of complex grain varieties, it is also necessary to advocate "eating what you have." Over the past five years, the Chinese people have overcome two relatively large disasters, and we have the strength and confidence to overcome the disaster this year.

The state's operation of grain is still at a loss at present. In the past, due to the need to fight a tough battle with speculators in the free market, it was inevitable to lose money, and the unified procurement and unified sales have changed this situation. In the future, in the procurement of grain in remote areas, the transportation of grain for disaster relief, and the supply to economic crop areas, it will still be necessary to lose money, but the situation has become relatively easy to grasp. We already have the conditions to actively promote economic accounting, gradually promote reasonable transportation, strive to reduce costs, and strive to achieve the goal of changing from losing money to not losing money as soon as possible.

The loss rate of grain storage has been greatly reduced due to the efforts of cadres and the help of the masses. Last year and this year, a batch of worm-free and mold-free warehouses have appeared, and the advanced experience of these warehouses is being promoted nationwide. However, there are still many backward warehouses, and there are still many serious situations of account confusion and unclear property. There are also individual cases of concealing losses and theft, which are illegal and undisciplined behaviors. Since last winter, after the implementation of the unified procurement and unified sales of grain, due to the attention of the local organizations of the Communist Party of China and the local people's governments, and the strong assistance of the procuratorial organs, supervisory commissions, and public security departments, these bad situations have been greatly improved. At present, we are working hard to improve the collection and payment system in the business aspect, strengthen the responsibility system, promote quota management, and formulate reward and punishment measures to consolidate and improve the achievements we have made. Over the past few years, the construction of warehouses has progressed rapidly, but the number of stored grains has increased even faster; therefore, many grains are still stored in the open air and civilian houses, and this problem needs to be gradually solved in the future.

The output rate of grain processing has been improved a lot. However, the machinery and equipment are generally old, and technical personnel are lacking. Therefore, the problem of removing sand and impurities in grain, although it is actively promoting the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and striving to improve, is still not satisfactory. The distribution of processing plants is very unreasonable, causing waste in transportation, and there are still phenomena of theft and waste of state property in entrusted processing. In the future, it is necessary to adjust and correct this in combination with the socialist transformation of private processing plants.

The grain work still has a long and arduous road ahead, and we have no reason to be satisfied with the status quo. The purpose of grain work is to supply the people with more abundant, cleaner, fresher, and more suitable grain; but this purpose can only be gradually achieved on the basis of continuous improvement of grain production and technological equipment through our unremitting efforts. During this period, in order to cope with unexpected disasters, it is necessary to replenish grain reserves; in order to increase production and improve technology, it is also necessary to accumulate funds for the state. This also requires the active support of the broad masses of the people. Therefore, saving grain should become a social virtue that everyone observes and a major sign of actively implementing the Constitution.

To build a socialist society, we must do a good job in grain work. In the great era of Mao Zedong, under the radiance of the great Constitution, as long as we are good at accepting leadership, obeying laws and disciplines, relying on the masses, not being complacent, not being conservative, not being rash, actively working hard, studying diligently, and continuously improving, the work will definitely be done well.

I request that all representatives give us strict criticism and continuous help and supervision in our work.

**Speech by Ba Jin:**

Standing on this platform, I feel extremely tense because six hundred million people are listening to the voice coming from here.

I listened to Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report and was very excited. This report truly and correctly summarizes the brilliant achievements of our country in various aspects over the past five years. These achievements are what the people of the whole country have seen with their own eyes. In the past five years, changes have been constantly taking place around each of us. Without relying on numbers, everyone can cite a few facts to illustrate the country's leap forward progress. The Chinese people, who have been oppressed and enslaved for a long time, have stood up and become the masters of their own fertile and vast land, ending the past suffering of cold and hunger. Six hundred million people have united into a whole, using selfless labor to participate in the construction of the motherland. In our country, every hand is moving, every brain is thinking, every heart is full of love, every light is shining, every piece of coal is warm, every gear is turning, and every tool is in use. All this is for a common ideal, a common cause. Under a unified plan, from south to north, from east to west, which place is not changing? Which place does not have the sound of axes and hammers? Where can you not hear laughter and singing? Which day can you not see new people and new things? For the people of Sichuan, there is nothing more moving than hearing the sound of steam from the train on the Chengdu-Chongqing line. What other government can achieve the forty-year wish of the Sichuan people in such a short time?

Today, our country has become a strong and independent country, and it is advancing towards a prosperous and happy socialist society with invincible strength. Facing this great reality, we literary workers are indeed very excited, but at the same time, we are also very ashamed. We cannot deny that in the field of literature over the past five years, some works that are loved by the people have been produced, and these works have more or less reflected the earth-shaking changes in our country, and have created some artistic images of heroes with noble qualities. However, this achievement is not commensurate with the overall situation of New China. Wang Yunsheng, a representative, mentioned in his speech at the conference that "in the cultural field, especially lacking creative work, novels and scripts are very few," which exactly shows the phenomenon of backwardness in literature and art today. We live among the people, laughing and advancing with the people, but we have not fully expressed the joy, love, and unity of the people. This glorious era is reflected in our works and appears dim. Our works often become lifeless and powerless things because the authors want to be stable and considerate, and satisfy everyone. Over the past few years, how many literary workers have written "dry and emotionless articles" as mentioned by Wang Yunsheng, a representative? I am one of them. If we cannot overcome our shortcomings, we will be abandoned by the readers.

Our shortcomings are indeed many: on the one hand, we have not sung the praises of our country's new people and new things with sufficient enthusiasm; on the other hand, we have not exposed and criticized the unhealthy and backward phenomena in our society in a timely manner. Everyone knows that our country is full of fresh and bright things, but the rotten and dying things left by the old society have not been completely eliminated. These things, under the impact of new forces, still occasionally raise their heads to make their last struggle. And the bureaucratism that exists in some of our state organs is actually helping to prolong their lives. Some representatives mentioned bureaucratism in their speeches at the conference. Indeed, bureaucratism is not something that will disappear after being criticized once or twice. Today, we still often hear stories of bureaucratism from the people, as if we are reading Gogol's and Saltykov-Shchedrin's novels. For example, some cadres come from among the people, but like to lock themselves in the office, wasting their days in paperwork. Some cadres forget that they are servants of the people, only like to hear flattery, and do not like to listen to criticism, and often do not consider the opinions of the people. Some leading departments often do not conduct detailed investigations and comprehensive research, but make decisions and issue orders based on subjective wishes; subordinates mechanically execute them, do not reflect the real situation, and do not consider whether this method is beneficial to the state and the people. These facts, although they have brought some losses to our country and the people, have not reduced the prestige of our government among the masses. The eyes of the people are bright. The Party and the government have repeatedly called on the people of the whole country to use the weapons of criticism and self-criticism to fight against all bad tendencies, and we literary workers should use our pens to carry out such criticism and self-criticism, to help the government overcome various backward phenomena. After the implementation of the Constitution, our government will certainly have more ways to thoroughly eliminate the bad phenomena left by the old society.

Fellow representatives, we come from different regions to Beijing, and we all remember the scene when we set off: how many hands tightly held our hands, how many warm eyes looked at us, how many excited voices gave us instructions. We brought the hearts of six hundred million people into the conference hall, and we will not forget the common wish of six hundred million people: to arrange a brilliant future for the country, to arrange a limitlessly beautiful future for future generations. Our work is solemn, and our work is also arduous. Looking back at the brilliant achievements of the past five years, and then seeing the joyous scene of the people of the whole country celebrating the birth of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, we have more confidence in our work. The common wish of six hundred million people will definitely be realized. As representatives of the people, we must dedicate our whole hearts to the people. Striving wholeheartedly for the cause of the people is the most beautiful and glorious thing in life.

**Speech by Liu Daosheng:**

Over the past five years, the Communist Party of China and the people's government have led the people of the whole country to do tremendous work, and have especially cared for and educated the youth to become the new generation of socialist construction. We sincerely thank the Party and the people's government, and thank our beloved leader and teacher, Chairman Mao.

Currently, there are a few issues that need attention in the work of educating the youth.

First, schools are important places for educating the youth. Over the past few years, the number of students in our country has increased rapidly, and many talents have been cultivated for various construction posts, which should be thanked by the hundreds of millions of people's teachers. However, the low quality of teaching is still a problem that exists in school education. Some of our educational administrators often only pay attention to managing people and money, and have not focused their main efforts on managing teaching work. We believe that the government's education department and school authorities should seriously do these things, plan and guide teachers' continuing education, and actually reduce their social work burden, so that they have more time to prepare lessons and study. Teachers are the models for students, and the morality of teachers has a great influence on students, so it is necessary to strengthen political and ideological leadership for them, and to give timely praise and rewards to teachers with outstanding achievements, and to deal with individuals with bad qualities seriously. In addition, we hope that the government's education department will make up its mind to concentrate manpower to improve the existing textbooks, and first compile a set of better textbooks for primary and secondary schools. In schools, the Youth League organization has a greater responsibility to help improve teaching, unite students to strictly abide by learning discipline, and mobilize all aspects of strength to run the school well.

Second, over the past few years, due to the efforts of all writers and the broad cultural workers, we have already had many excellent literary works, which have played a great role in educating the youth. However, there are still too few works that reflect our people's current struggle life and inspire the youth's fighting spirit. The historical struggles of the people reflected in our national operas have not been fully promoted. The youth yearn for good songs, dances, and one-act plays. These aspects indeed need us to make greater efforts. We hope that the government will consider appropriate award methods to encourage literary and artistic creation from all aspects, and to advocate the atmosphere of caring for and cherishing new works. All good and educational works that are welcomed by the masses should be widely introduced and organized for criticism, to help writers improve further. The creative power of our country is still very weak, so the problem of cultivating young writers is a major responsibility of the relevant cultural departments and the Youth League.

Third, the publication of books is a tool for the Party and the state to carry out political, ideological, and cultural education for the people, and is a powerful weapon on the ideological front. Over the past five years, we have published many books for youth, adolescents, and children, and have widely educated the growing generation. The current serious problem is: the supply of popular books for workers and peasants to study politics and culture is far from enough. Even if there are some good books, due to the defects in the distribution work, they cannot really reach the workers and peasants. At the same time, the popular introductory books on Marxism-Leninism and cultural and scientific knowledge that the general youth urgently need are extremely lacking, and the poverty of children's books is even more serious. This urgently needs the joint efforts of the state publishing organs and writers to solve. The Youth League should also do its best to help writers and publishers, constantly reflect the demands of the youth groups, and strengthen the guidance and organization of youth reading work. As far as we know, the number of private publishing houses increased by nearly two hundred in 1952 compared to 1950, and many of them do not have any editing power, relying on scissors and glue to produce shoddy books, and the books they publish not only have low ideological level, but some also distort the state's policies, spread backward ideas, and advocate obscenity and theft. These speculative publishing houses that continue to poison the youth cannot be tolerated, and we suggest that the government resolutely rectify them.

Fellow representatives, Chairman Mao has pointed out the direction of advance to the people of the whole country, and Premier Zhou Enlai has also put forward our current work tasks. We, the youth of the whole country, will definitely strive to realize them!

**Speech by Tao Zhiyue:**

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I am filled with boundless joy and excitement to express my sincere support for Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, in the past five years, under the wise and correct leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, we have achieved great victories and achievements on various fronts, which are unprecedented in history. The ideals that countless patriots and gentlemen in our country have longed for for many years have become living realities. In such a great historical period, I am able to participate in the work, which is indescribably thankful and joyful.

The troops of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have, over the past five years, undertaken the dual tasks of defending the motherland and building the motherland. We are guarding the borders of the motherland, and at the same time, we are following the instructions of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao to carry out the glorious task of the army participating in production. The entire production process is a process of struggling with nature and a process of learning technology. Due to the correct leadership and strong support of the Party and the government, as well as the selfless labor of all commanders and soldiers, we have achieved great results. In the past four years, we have built several water conservancy projects, harvested 286,000 tons of grain, and gradually increased the yield per unit area of various crops. The 20,000 acres of cotton fields in the Manas River reclamation area have created a high-yield record of 402 jin of seed cotton per acre. The cotton we harvest has already begun to be transported to Shanghai to support national industrial production. Other engineering construction, transportation, and sideline production have also developed significantly. However, at the same time, there are still many shortcomings and errors in our work. Some of our production units have not been serious and responsible in implementing the policy towards nationalities and group discipline, and in handling issues related to land, water conservancy, pastures, and grasslands between the army and the people, there have been phenomena of not considering the interests of the people and even infringing upon the interests of the people. The management and scientific and technological learning of various productions have not kept up with the needs of production development, and the phenomena of loss and waste are still serious. Some of these shortcomings and errors have been corrected, and some still need to be overcome in the future. In this great period when our motherland is carrying out socialist construction and socialist transformation, we deeply feel that we can share a part of the work and contribute a part of our strength in supporting national construction and strengthening national defense forces, which is our greatest honor. In the future, we will definitely continue to strengthen our unity with the various nationalities of Xinjiang to overcome shortcomings, overcome difficulties, and better complete the tasks of defending the motherland and production construction.

Due to the superior natural environment of Xinjiang, vast land, and fertile soil, agriculture has great potential. Especially for the cultivation of cotton, the conditions are said to be "sun on top, wet feet," and the climate of Xinjiang is the most suitable. As long as the water conservancy problem can be solved, the area of cotton fields can be expanded, and good harvests can be obtained. The Central Government has built many projects in water conservancy construction in Xinjiang in recent years; in the future, in addition to the strength of the troops themselves, we hope to give appropriate support within the possible range, so that the goal of large-scale cotton production can be achieved. This will be helpful for the development of the state's textile industry.

Today, I have the opportunity to speak at the solemn National People's Congress representing six hundred million people, and I feel extremely excited. Before the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang, I had long served the traitorous clique of Chiang Kai-shek. After joining the revolution, through the profound education of the past five years, I deeply understand the greatness of the Communist Party of China. Due to the leniency and education of the Communist Party, I have gained a bright future, which I will never forget.

Now, the traitorous clique of Chiang Kai-shek is still under the protection of American imperialism, stationed in Taiwan, and continues to do evil, which is absolutely intolerable to the people of the whole country. Our sacred territory of Taiwan will not be liberated, and the traitorous clique of Chiang Kai-shek will not be completely eliminated, and our great liberation cause will not be finally completed. We resolutely stand with the people of the whole country to fight to the end for the glorious task of liberating Taiwan and eliminating the traitorous clique of Chiang Kai-shek.

**Speech by Xie Fuzhi:**

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report. The experience of national work summarized in this report is also the basic experience of Yunnan work.

Yunnan is located on the border of the motherland and is a province with many nationalities. Doing a good job in national unity and consolidating the border work has become the most important task of Yunnan's work. In the past few years, due to the resolute implementation of the central government's policy towards nationalities, more than twenty nationalities in the province, which are extremely imbalanced in economy, culture, and many other aspects, have united in the big family of the motherland, and have jointly carried out the instructions of the central government and various tasks of local work. This has made the tragic and powerless life of various nationalities, which was brought about by the national hatred and national oppression created by the imperialists and the Kuomintang bandits in the past, a thing of the past. The new fact is that various nationalities have implemented regional autonomy and have the right to be masters of the house; national unity and mutual trust are increasing day by day; the backward situation of "slash-and-burn agriculture" in production is changing; people's income is increasing, and life has improved compared to the past; many border areas have replaced the concept of the famous Yunnan malaria area in history with the concept of fertile land and vast forests. Of course, all these are only the beginning of the work, and in the future, it will be a very arduous historical task to make various different nationalities in the province, in such a vast area where each county includes several nationalities, transition to socialism in a stable and orderly manner according to the provisions of the Constitution and in full accordance with the actual situation of each nationality. If we do not seriously overcome the shortcomings in our work, especially in the work of national unity, and do not constantly struggle against various erroneous ideas, the realization of this task is not guaranteed. There are many shortcomings in our work, for example, the work of training and promoting a large number of minority cadres is still not done enough, and there is still a lack of more planned training and education for the more than 11,000 minority cadres who are already in place; in the implementation of policies, sometimes we deviate from the original work basis, mechanically copy the methods of Han areas, and are not good at using the ways that various nationalities like to see and hear to carry out work, thus showing impatience and impetuousness; or neglect the growth of progressive factors in minority nationalities, do not see the influence and changes brought about by the achievements of work in recent years, and thus passively deal with some necessary and possible work; some Han cadres do not respect the customs and habits of minority nationalities, and cannot patiently and enthusiastically help and rely on minority masses, and also show incorrect attitudes in uniting national public leaders. These great nationalism thoughts and local nationalism thoughts in some minority cadres are all obstacles to the realization of the above tasks, and must be corrected through education, criticism, and serious struggle.

The convening of the First National People's Congress marks a new stage in the people's democratic system. I am honored to be among them and must guarantee to the Congress: to study Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China and Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, and to guarantee to implement the spirit of these two reports: to strictly abide by the Constitution and all laws, to be loyal to the people's democratic system, to serve the people wholeheartedly, to be a sincere and honest servant of the people. At the same time, under the cultivation of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, to carry out thorough ideological transformation, to overcome the errors and shortcomings in my work; to guarantee to contribute all my strength to the socialist construction of the motherland, to the struggle for the liberation of Taiwan, and to the cause of world peace.

Li Renren, a representative from Yunnan Province, spoke at the First Session of the First National People's Congress. He acknowledged that Yunnan, being one of the later regions to be liberated and with a relatively weak foundation for work, faces significant challenges. Despite these obstacles, he emphasized the need for active and cautious efforts to achieve the great task of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. He stressed the importance of following the centralized and unified leadership of the central government, overcoming shortcomings in the current construction work, and ensuring that the tasks assigned by the state are successfully executed.

Li Renren highlighted several issues in Yunnan's work, including the lack of clear understanding among some cadres about relying on the working class and completing national plans comprehensively and evenly. He noted problems such as waste, rework, and violations of construction procedures in building projects, as well as inconsistent production performance in some manufacturing units in Kunming. In agricultural transformation, while mutual aid and cooperation have shown results, these efforts have not been widely implemented, and capitalist spontaneous forces in rural areas have not been adequately curbed.

To address these issues, Li Renren called for strengthening unity among all ethnic groups in Yunnan, based on the provisions of the Constitution and in conjunction with local conditions. He urged all state organ workers, especially leading cadres, to conduct thorough self-criticism and criticism, promptly rectify errors and shortcomings in their work, and remember Chairman Mao's instructions to "be humble and prudent, guard against arrogance and impetuosity." He emphasized the need to rely closely on the masses and work diligently to accomplish various tasks.

Li Renren expressed his excitement and support for the government work report delivered by Premier Zhou Enlai. He praised the significant achievements made in various fields since the founding of the People's Republic of China and the progress in building a socialist new China. He reiterated his support for the correct policies and guidelines of the Central People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party.

Li Renren also discussed specific issues in Yunnan, such as the need for the government to plan and construct based on regional characteristics, develop livestock and forestry, and utilize the rich marine resources. He suggested improving transportation and allocation of materials to ensure timely delivery of products and supply of necessary materials.

In conclusion, Li Renren proposed that the conference adopt the government work report and that he would strive to disseminate and implement it widely.

### 在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上  代表们关于政府工作报告的发言

    在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上
    代表们关于政府工作报告的发言
    何香凝代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意和拥护周总理的政府工作报告。
    中华人民共和国的第一部宪法，已经庄严地通过了。这个具有伟大历史意义的宪法，反映了我国人民的共同意志和愿望，同时也反映了国外广大华侨长期的愿望，体现了祖国对国外华侨的深切关怀和照顾。它必将鼓舞着全国人民为建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会而加倍努力，也必将促进国外华侨更加紧密地团结在伟大祖国的周围。
    一千二百万华侨是热爱祖国的。五十年来，在中国人民推翻封建帝制的辛亥革命中，在中国第一次国内革命战争、第二次国内革命战争、抗日战争，以及彻底推翻帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的中国人民解放战争中，都有不少爱国的华侨参加。国外华侨和祖国联结的纽带是任何人割不断的，过去是这样，今后更是如此。
    国外华侨在侨居地多年来对当地社会的经济开发和繁荣有很大贡献。他们并不愿参加当地政治纷争，也不想参与当地内政。他们所要求的是和当地人民友好相处，并希望他们所在国的政府能同自己祖国建立友好关系。
    但是国外华侨的处境是非常复杂的。一方面，祖国是日益强大了，祖国国际地位和国际关系日益提高和发展，帝国主义好战集团日陷孤立，国际局势开始有了缓和，这些对于国外侨胞处境的改善，都是有利的；但是仇视中华人民共和国的帝国主义好战集团，也就越加仇视华侨，故华侨在国外处境的困难是会有所增加。另一方面，祖国是在坚定而稳步地向社会主义社会过渡中，然而国外华侨的绝大多数，是生活在根本不相同的环境里。再一方面，是华侨在国外从事劳动，生产资料以及财产大部又都在国外；可是华侨的眷属大部分在国内，华侨在国内眷属的生活又大多依靠国外亲属的劳动所得来维持。这是一种复杂的情况，而且，这种情况是长期存在的。因而五年来国家对保护国外华侨的正当权利和利益，对归国华侨的安置和指导，对华侨在国内的眷属的政策，都是考虑到华侨上述的特殊情况来加以处理的。换言之，就是政府对华侨推行和贯彻国家的一般政策法令时，必须考虑和制订有关华侨的各种政策，作为国家总的政策中不可分割的部分。
    几年来，政府的侨务政策，在国外方面，主要是协助和指导华侨进行互助互济，兴办文教福利事业，增进华侨间的友爱团结，发扬爱国精神，同时为增进华侨同侨居国人民的友好关系而努力。在国内方面，对归国华侨和难侨给予适当的安置和指导，便利侨汇，举办归国华侨学生补习学校，辅导归国华侨参加工农业生产，指导国内的华侨眷属在自愿原则下参加各种劳动生产，并协助有关部门，制订华侨的出入国条例，以便利华侨。同时，在重要的社会改革运动中，根据华侨及其国内眷属的实际情况考虑给予一定的照顾。如中央人民政府政务院在一九五○年就制订了“土地改革中对华侨土地财产的处理办法”；在推行婚姻法的宣传教育运动中，中央人民政府政务院发出了“对华侨婚姻问题的纠纷的处理办法”。
    诸位代表，从上述情况中不难看出，华侨事务所牵涉的范围是很广泛的，很多工作都是一部或全部同其它政府部门的业务有关，而过去各级侨务机构在实施有关华侨的政策时，都是在政府的各个部门的配合协助下才能收到成效。因此，如果华侨工作过去有些成绩的话，也绝不单单是华侨事务部门的成绩，而是政府各个部门共同协力的结果。
    但是过去在华侨工作方面，我们是有缺点的。我们对华侨的具体政策，有些制订不及时，或者仅仅有了政策，但是这些政策没有同广大群众见面，或者是见面得太迟了。在土地改革运动中，华南少数地区曾产生过忽视华侨问题的偏向，而我们对纠正这些偏向的步骤，采取得太迟缓，其结果，对于少数应予以照顾的华侨及其眷属，没有给以应有的照顾。这些偏差，后来在一九五三年的土地改革的复查中，已经基本上纠正过来了。又如保护侨汇问题，中央华侨事务委员会和中国人民银行早已制订了具体的政策，但直到最近还发现这些政策并没有向区乡干部及乡村中有关群众作公开交代，政策并没有深入下达，并没有同群众很好地见面。如果说，有个别的地方还发生违犯侨汇政策的现象的话，那么政策没有下达，没有交代，因而没有贯彻，就是它的主要原因。
    另一方面，还必须指出，有个别地区的干部甚至负责人曾不愿正视华侨问题的特殊性，怕麻烦，图省事，而不愿把复杂的特殊问题同一般的问题区别开来，加以研究，加以处理。这种缺点和错误，也应在今后工作中加以纠正。
    这次全国人民代表大会会议不久就要产生新的国家机关，我想，将来根据宪法及地方各级人民代表大会和地方各级人民委员会组织法成立起来的新的各级华侨事务机构，它的任务应该是：努力促进国外华侨的团结，发扬华侨的传统的爱国精神；对国内归侨应尽量予以适当安置，指导和组织他们接受社会主义的教育与改造，并根据他们不同的情况，予以可能和必需的照顾。华侨事务机关必须积极为华侨、归侨和国内侨眷服务，克服事务主义和对华侨的切身利益漠不关心的官僚主义。
    当前华侨工作中必须处理的比较重大的问题，第一是有关华侨的国籍问题，周总理已讲了，我不必重复。在这里，我仅补充一句，以证实周总理在政府工作报告中有关华侨国籍问题中所指出的原则，就是国外华侨也是十分关切华侨的国籍问题能得到合理解决的。其次，对侨汇问题，应该建议政府采取有效措施，通令有关地区和有关部门，使侨汇政策得以切实地贯彻。第三，国家除了继续辅导华侨回国参加工业生产外，欢迎华侨在国内各地开发山林荒地，种植农园，开办牧场，并欢迎华侨大量兴造房屋和兴办文教事业。这样做对华侨是有利的，对国家的社会主义建设是有帮助的。
    蒋贼逃离祖国大陆以后，在美帝国主义的掩护之下，盘踞我台湾省，同时驱迫其爪牙，流窜到国外华侨众多的地区，进行祸侨害侨的阴谋活动，欺骗华侨钱财，欺迫华侨充当炮灰，无恶不作。国外侨胞为着减少自身所受蒋匪帮的灾害，无不热望祖国早日解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团。
    华侨在国外的处境是困难的。在蒋匪帮公开进行祸侨害侨的一些地方，华侨的处境更加困难。但华侨的内心仍是热爱祖国的。祖国人民和政府对于这些地方侨胞的处境，至为关怀，对于他们的困难处境是谅解的。逃亡到了国外的蒋匪人员，他们在国外受美帝国主义和蒋贼的驱迫，为非作恶，已经做下了许多坏事。我们必须劝告他们立即停止所有祸侨害侨的活动。不要再盲目追随中国人民公敌蒋匪介石了。今天，在祖国人民的伟大感召之下，只要他们能幡然悔悟，弃恶从善，停止在华侨中的罪恶行为，祖国人民和广大侨胞是容许他们弃暗投明，重回家园同家人团聚的。
    各位代表从这里可以看到，我们的侨务工作，同全国人民为解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团的神圣事业，关系是怎样的密切；也可看到，国内的侨务工作，对国外华侨的工作，关系也是怎样的密切。国内的侨务工作，对于促进国外华侨的爱国团结，是息息相关的。国内侨务工作的每一项措施，都会直接地影响到国外侨务工作；或者是促进华侨的爱国团结，堵塞蒋贼卖国害侨阴谋活动的空隙；不然就会影响国外华侨的团结，给予蒋贼破坏华侨团结以可乘之隙。
    这些都说明了我们国家侨务工作任务的重要，要我们侨务工作人员和有关部门足够地重视侨务工作，更加兢兢业业，为做好国内外侨务工作而加倍努力。
    最后，希望大家对侨务工作多加关怀，并给予指导。
    鲍尔汉代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告。新疆解放后，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，实现了各民族的一律平等和各民族间空前未有的大团结，这一团结正在日益巩固和不断发展中。
    生活在祖国大家庭里的新疆各族人民，五年来，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的领导下，在伟大的汉族人民的帮助下，胜利地完成了土地改革和各项民主改革运动，进行了各项建设工作。一九五三年同一九四九年相较，农业耕地面积扩大了百分之二十九点二九，粮食产量增加了百分之五十九点六三，牲畜数字增加了百分之三十二点三三。目前农村中的互助合作运动正在稳步开展，水利建设正在继续进行。过去的新疆是没有近代工业的，五年来我们修建了钢铁厂、机器制造厂、自动化电厂、汽车修配厂、棉纺织厂、缫丝厂、面粉厂、煤矿、水泥厂等企业；在发展农牧业和工业生产的同时，交通运输、内外贸易以及文教卫生事业等都有了显著的发展。随着各项建设事业的发展，地方财政收支已接近平衡，各族人民的物质生活和文化生活的水平也有了显著的提高。以上这些成绩的获得，不仅改变了新疆的旧面貌，而且为新疆各族人民同全国人民一道胜利完成国家过渡时期总任务创造了良好条件。新疆各族人民已深刻地体验到只有在统一的祖国大家庭内，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，才能享有这样幸福的生活，走向更加美好的将来。全疆人民对我们伟大的祖国，对中国共产党和毛主席有着无限的热爱。
    五年来，我们在工作中也产生过不少缺点和错误，目前主要是还存在着官僚主义和命令主义的现象，执行政策中常常发生一些偏差，领导机关对某些工作缺乏及时的和深入的检查和督促。新疆省的财经工作有些还未走上轨道，财经工作中的政治思想领导不够，某些财经企业中还有资本主义的经营作风，对大力培养各民族的财经工作干部也作的不够，浪费和损坏国家财产的现象还不断发生。虽然各民族间是空前地团结起来了，但是在某些地方、某些干部中，还残存着大民族主义和地方民族主义倾向。对这些缺点和错误，我们正以最大努力来纠正和克服，并希望中央能经常派人下去检查和帮助工作。今后，我们将更加紧密地团结在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的周围，戒骄戒躁，谦虚谨慎，遵循着中华人民共和国宪法所指引的方向，为继续巩固我们伟大祖国的统一、加强各民族的团结、大力支援解放台湾、把我国建成为繁荣幸福的社会主义社会而奋斗。
    张奚若代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意周恩来总理的政府工作报告。我现在要讲几句关于普通教育的话，作为一种补充说明。
    中华人民共和国的普通教育，在中国共产党和中央人民政府的正确领导下，经过全国人民的支持和全国教育工作者的努力，五年来获得了空前的发展。
    根据一九五三年的统计，全国小学学生有五千一百五十万人，普通中学和工农速成中学学生有二百九十五万九千多人，中等师范学校学生有三十六万九千多人，高等师范学校学生有三万九千多人。这些数字都大大地超过了旧中国历史上的最高数字。
    少数民族教育，也有很大的发展。根据一九五三年的统计，全国少数民族小学已经发展到二万六千四百三十六所，学生二百五十四万六千多人；中等学校二百七十五所，学生十六万三千多人。在各少数民族学校中，都采用本民族的语言教学。有些少数民族还没有文字，人民政府正在帮助他们创造文字。
    各级学校在发展中都贯彻了教育为工农服务的方针，各级学校尽量给工农子女以入学的便利条件。现在工农子女在小学、中学和师范学校学生中，已经由少数变成了大多数或多数。为了更快地培养工农出身的建设人才，我们还创办了工农速成中学，现在已经有大批的工农出身的干部和产业工人考进这些学校学习。
    五年来，我们曾经对教育制度、教育内容和教学方法等进行了一系列的改革，在各级学校学生中进行了革命的政治思想教育，在教师中也开展了思想改造运动。这些都收到了很大的成效，教育质量也在不断地提高。
    但是我们的缺点还是很多的，主要的是教育质量低。首先是各级学校的政治思想教育还很薄弱，忽视劳动教育的现象特别严重。许多中学和小学学生毕业后，只愿升学，不愿从事劳动生产。有些学校对纪律教育注意不够，以致在学生中还存在着纪律松弛的现象。其次，是学生的文化和科学知识水平还不高，历年投考高等学校和中等学校的高中和初中毕业生，还有许多人的成绩是不及格的。还有，师生的健康状况也不够好，几年来虽然在这方面已有所改善，但师生健康不良仍然是目前一个比较严重的问题。
    当然这些缺点是有一定的历史根源的。旧中国遗留给我们的学校教育基础十分薄弱，旧社会学校教育遗留给我们的思想影响也很深重；但是主要的还是我们的工作做得不好。中央教育部对政治思想教育注意不够，特别是对轻视体力劳动和轻视体力劳动者的思想没有进行系统的深刻的批判，这是一个重大的错误。此外，我们对教学工作、教材编辑、教师学习等都缺乏有计划的具体领导。在一个时期内，我们在教育发展上还有过盲目冒进的偏差。这些都是我们教育部应当继续深刻检讨和努力改正的。
    今后普通教育，必须适应国家建设的需要，在发展生产的基础上积极地稳步地发展。首先是发展高级中学和完全中学，以供应高等学校培养国家建设人才的需要；其次是有计划有重点地发展初中和小学，特别是大城市和工矿区的中学和小学，以适当满足人民的文化要求。但是整个教育发展的关键在于师资问题，因此，发展师范教育，尤其是高等师范教育，是我们最重要的任务。
    不过目前国家正在集中力量进行工业建设，还不可能拿出更多的财力、物力、人力来更大量地发展中学和小学；因此，在今后相当长的时期内，中学和小学毕业生能够升学的只能是其中的一小部分，大部分只能在毕业后从事工、农业生产劳动。这是在现阶段发展工农业所绝对必要的。
    在整个普通教育和师范教育的工作中，我们必须特别注意提高教育的质量。这就要求我们认真贯彻全面发展的方针。首先要加强政治思想教育，以社会主义思想教育青年和儿童，使他们能有社会主义的政治方向，辩证唯物论的世界观和共产主义的道德品质。当前应当着重爱国主义教育和集体主义教育，尤其要正确地加强劳动教育和纪律教育。我们要使学生建立社会主义的劳动观点和劳动态度，充分认识“劳动是中华人民共和国一切有劳动能力的公民的光荣的事情”，确立热爱劳动、热爱劳动人民的思想。我们还要使学生深刻了解：新中国的宪法、法律和各项纪律，都是人民政府赖以巩固人民民主专政，保障公民权利和安全，保证国家发展生产和进行各项建设的极其重要的武器。每个爱国的公民“必须遵守宪法和法律，遵守劳动纪律，遵守公共秩序，尊重社会公德”。每个学生必须遵守学校的规则和纪律，养成守法的品德和习惯。但是要贯彻上面所说的这些方针，除学校教育外，还需要学生家长和社会人士同学校结合起来，协同学校以社会主义思想教育新生一代。
    当前改进教学的首要任务，是要用社会主义的思想和先进的科学知识制订和修订各级学校的教学大纲和教科书，相应地改进教学方法，并且提高在职教师的政治水平和业务水平。我们还必须切实地克服师生负担过重以及学校工作中现时还存在的若干忙乱现象。
    此外，我们还必须采取有效的措施进一步增进师生的健康，继续贯彻毛主席的“身体好、学习好、工作好”的指示和政务院“关于改善各级学校学生健康状况的决定”。
    几年来，全国教育工作者的辛勤劳动所取得的成就是巨大的。今后随着国家经济建设的不断发展，我国普通教育的发展将是十分宏伟的，我们的工作任务将会更加繁重。我们相信，在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，在全国人民的支持和协助下，我们全体教育工作者一定会继续加强团结，克服困难，发挥更大的积极性和创造性，来完成祖国和人民交给我们的培养社会主义新人这个光荣而伟大的任务。
    曾希圣代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意和拥护周总理的政府工作报告。
    五年以来全国在各个方面各个地区的工作都取得了伟大的成就，当然安徽也不例外。但我不拟从全面工作多作说明，我只就安徽人民所最感激的，全国人民所最关心的，也还是当前工作中比较艰巨的生产救灾工作说几句话。
    安徽地处江淮之间，是个多灾的省份。据历史记载的资料统计，从公元前二百四十六年到一九四八年，大约两千年间，曾发生过大小水灾九百七十九次。据几年来的民间调查，在最近百年当中是五年一小灾，十年一大灾，三十年中一次连续灾。到国民党统治时期，由于水利失修，掘黄入淮，更形成了“小雨小灾”、“大雨大灾”、“无雨旱灾”的年年有灾的严重现象。大家还记得：一九四九年，江、淮并涨，五种五淹，灾民八百多万；一九五○年，沿淮遭受了非常洪患，灾民近千万；一九五一年是最好的年成，也仍有二、三百万亩的涝灾和旱灾；一九五二年，虽未发生洪水，但涝灾达一千五百万亩以上，灾民五百七十余万；一九五三年，涝、旱虽然较轻，但意想不到的霜灾又突然袭来；今年的洪水更为百年所未有，沿淮地区由于治淮的效果，灾情大有减轻，但沿江灾害极为严重，许多高产作物地区都因积水过深或因圩堤溃决，已经颗粒无收，这就是安徽灾情严重的大概情况。
    虽然如此，我们仍然战胜了这种严重的灾害。我们之所以能够战胜它，首先是由于中央人民政府和全国人民给了巨大的物质支持。从一九四九年到一九五三年，中央调拨给安徽的救济粮款和各种物资总计达一万五千亿元。特别是今年，中央以更大的力量来支援我们，首先是以大量资材投入防汛抢险，接着又以大量粮款和种籽、帐篷等物品救济灾民，车运不及，继之以空运，因而，不仅使灾民得到救济，而且帮助灾民解决了许多生产上的困难。其次是由于中央制订了“生产自救”的方针，所以几年以来虽然连年遭受严重灾害，但农业生产仍然逐年上升。一九四九年全省收成仅九十一亿斤，一九五○年增到一百零一亿斤，一九五一年增到一百七十三亿斤；一九五二年灾情虽比一九五一年为重，但收成仍增到一百七十六亿斤；一九五三年灾情虽比一九五二年为重，但收成又增到了一百七十九亿斤。今年洪水虽为百年来所未有，但由于加强了非灾区的田间管理和采取了排水补种、消灭休息地、开垦新荒地、培养再生稻、再生高粱以及混种、套种等措施，收成仍可达到一百五十亿斤左右，比解放前的最高产量还高百分之十二点八。同时由于发展了各种副业生产，扩大了种菜面积，从各方面增加了灾民收入，所以就度过了几年以来严重的灾荒，并积蓄了多灾地区的生产经验。第三，由于中央作出了“一定要把淮河修好”的决定，在淮河全线特别是在中游兴建了各种规模宏大的工程，因而不仅消灭了小雨小灾，减轻了大雨大灾，而且增加了增产的条件。如淮北宿县专区，向来是安徽的重灾区，但在百年未有的今年洪水情况下，还有增产可能，这是一个明显的考验。
    安徽人民说：“几年以来，无衣发衣，无粮发粮，无草发煤，病了给药，又帮助生产工具和肥料，指导生产技术，同时还治好淮河保证生产，人民政府真比冬天的太阳还暖，比骨肉爹娘还亲。”又说：“反动派的苦，三天三夜诉不完；毛主席的恩，八辈子也忘不了。”在这里，请让我代表安徽人民向全国人民致以深切的感谢，向中央人民政府和中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席致以崇高的敬意！
    由于有以毛主席为首的中国共产党和中央人民政府的正确领导和支持，由于有全国人民的鼓励和援助，我们已完全战胜了一九四九年到一九五三年的各种灾害，达到了救灾不饿死人的要求，这是历史上任何朝代所不可能做到的事情。从此也就可以肯定，我们一定能够更好地战胜今年的灾害。但是我们决不以此自满。我们深深知道，不仅消灭灾害还是一个相当长期的艰苦斗争任务，而且在几年的生产救灾工作中也还存在许多严重的缺点和错误。例如在群众和基层干部中因为连年灾害所产生的不安情绪，因为连年救灾所产生的依赖思想，还未完全克服；因为灾情掌握不实，在发放救灾粮款中曾产生过的畸轻畸重现象，甚至对冒领或多领救济粮款的现象，也没有完全消除；因为发展副业生产，而可能增长的资本主义自发势力的倾向，也没有能够在事前加以防止。所有这些现象，都是同我们领导上教育不够、检查不严、交代不清的某些官僚主义作风的存在分不开的。我深深感到要做好各种工作，特别在灾害情况下做好各种工作，更要温习毛主席的著作，学习毛主席的工作方法，尤其是要牢牢地记住毛主席在这次大会开幕词中所教导我们的“老老实实，勤勤恳恳，互勉互助，力戒任何的虚夸和骄傲”的指示。我相信只要我们能够按照宪法办事，按照毛主席的指示办事，我们就一定能够完成社会主义建设和社会主义改造的任务，就一定能够完成战胜灾害征服大自然的任务。
    邓初民代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    当我走上这庄严的讲坛来表示衷心拥护周总理的政府工作报告的时候，我就不能不想到五年来我国政治、经济、文化乃至精神道德面貌各方面同旧中国迥然不同的情景；因而更不能不想到带领着我们经历千辛万苦取得民主革命胜利、现在又正在带领着我们走向社会主义革命胜利的伟大的中国共产党和毛主席。一九五四年九月二十日——这个永世难忘的日子，全国人民代表大会第一次会议又通过了保障人民革命胜利成果和建设社会主义社会的中华人民共和国宪法。有了这个宪法，我国人民就有了一个强有力的武器，将更加充满信心地为建设社会主义而奋斗！我们今后的任务，就是要严格遵守和贯彻这个宪法，一切按照宪法办事，使它成为我们实际行动的规范。我听了周总理的报告之后，谨以一个地方政府工作人员和人民代表的身份来发表一点不成熟的意见。
    五年来，山西人民和全国人民一样，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的领导下，顺利地完成了国家在经济恢复时期所给予它的各项任务。山西的工、农业在过去长期的战争中，曾经遭受到极其严重的摧残，但在短短的五年内，在工业方面由于进行了一系列的民主改革和生产改革，得到了迅速的恢复与发展。截至一九五三年年底，全省现代工业总产值即较一九四九年增加了五倍。一九五三年是我国开始执行第一个五年建设计划的第一年，在山西，国家许多的重点建设的新型企业正在兴建着，有的已开始投入生产。一九五三年全省现代工业及工场手工业的生产总值较一九五二年增长了百分之三十二，全省社会主义性质的国营、地方国营工业的生产总值已达现代工业及工场手工业的生产总值的百分之七十五以上。一九五四年国营、地方国营工业的总产值，预计又将比一九五三年提高百分之三十左右，并争取今年在完成国家计划的基础上增产节约的实际成绩不低于去年增缴利润的数字，即达四千四百亿元。
    在农业方面，也获得了显著的成绩。一九五二年全省粮食总产量较一九四九年增加了百分之四十八，一九五三年又比一九五二年增长了百分之十三，今年在部分地区遭受水、涝灾害的情况下，预计尚可较去年增加百分之六左右。从去年冬季大张旗鼓地宣传了国家在过渡时期的总任务之后，农业互助合作运动已有了飞跃的发展。截至一九五四年六月底止，山西已有农业生产合作社一万多个，为去年的四倍半；入社农户占全省农户总数的百分之九点六，参加农业生产合作社和互助组的农户总数已达全省农户总数的百分之七十。预计一九五五年全省参加农业生产合作社的农户将达全省农户总数的百分之三十五左右。
    随着工、农业生产的发展，其它经济建设事业和文化、教育事业也得到了相应的发展，人民物质生活和文化生活也得到了一定程度的改善。所有这些证明了周总理的报告是完全符合实际情况的，五年来中央人民政府的方针和政策是完全正确的。同时也证明了工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主制度具有极大的优越性。
    自然，在我们的工作中也还存在着很多的缺点与错误。以我负责的山西文教、卫生部门的工作来说，对中央团结改造知识分子的政策执行得就不够，对团结中西医的政策和改善环境卫生的工作也作得不够。建设时期各方面都需要有知识分子参加。山西文化较落后，知识分子很缺乏，而我们不少领导机关对待知识分子，往往同时存在忽视团结改造和迁就主义的两种偏向，这就不利于各方面的建设事业，因而必须引起我们的重视并用极大的努力来加以改正。我自己也是一个知识分子，这几年来在接触了一些实际工作之后，我深深感觉到自己正如毛主席所说过的只能算是一个半知识分子。我没有经过严格的革命斗争的锻炼，也没有实际工作经验，自以为懂得一点马克思列宁主义理论，但是往往不能与实际相联系。一接触到实际问题，就暴露出我自己夸夸其谈的教条主义倾向。所以对于实际工作不但提不出问题，更解决不了问题。正因为这样，我不仅没有把自己负责的文教部门的工作做好，而且作为一个民主党派的成员，在统一战线工作方面，也是有缺点的。差堪自慰的是我与同志同事之间、上下级之间、群众之间的关系还处得好，而且是一天比一天好。在这里，我深深体会到共产党的统一战线政策的正确性。同时又深深体会到一个知识分子的思想改造，必须首先解决理论与实际脱节的问题，而解决这个问题的关键在于彻底批判与克服资产阶级思想和小资产阶级思想。我的缺点正在于对自己所受到的资产阶级思想影响和小资产阶级思想估计、检查不够，这表现在：对自己要求的尺度过宽，常常以病、老来原谅自己。什么是资产阶级思想、小资产阶级思想呢？自私自利想占点小便宜，妄自尊大要面子，自觉地或不自觉地作个人打算，关心公事不如关心私事，关心别人不如关心自己，遇到损害人民和国家利益的问题，不坚持原则的自由主义，发现了自己和别人的错误和缺点不愿积极展开批评与自我批评。这些错误思想在社会主义改造过程中，如果不彻底改掉，就不可能把国家与人民交付自己的责任担负起来。几年来我虽然主观上是积极努力想把工作做好；但在实际上，作为一个政府工作人员，并没有尽到应尽的职责。这一直是我精神上的一个很重的担子。现在又受到人民的信任和委托当了全国人民代表大会代表，这个担子就更加沉重了。可是我已活到了伟大光荣的毛泽东时代，时代不允许、我自己也不甘愿自暴自弃，看到大家的进步就羡慕，看到自己的缺点也痛恨。所以我曾经不只一次地下过决心要在自己的脑子里开辟战场，同存在着的错误思想作斗争。但因为自己自我批评精神不够，所以进步很慢。
    中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的召开，标志着人民民主制度的新阶段。我光荣地列身其间，一定要向大会提出保证：保证努力学习刘少奇委员关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告和周恩来总理的政府工作报告，并要根据这两个报告的精神保证做到：严格地遵守宪法和一切法律，效忠人民民主制度，全心全意为人民服务，做一个忠诚老实的人民勤务员。同时还要在中国共产党和毛主席的培育之下，彻底进行思想改造，克服自己工作中的错误和缺点；保证为祖国的社会主义建设，为解放台湾的斗争，为世界和平事业贡献出自己的一切力量。
    杨廷宝代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我感到愉快和兴奋，第一届全国人民代表大会隆重地通过了中华人民共和国宪法和其他几个重要法律，我们国家的革命成果和社会主义建设方向，从此稳固地奠定下来了！
    听了周总理的报告，我完全拥护。自中华人民共和国成立以来，在反动派遗留的残破基础上，不但很快完成了整理恢复工作，并且已开始了有计划的大规模的经济建设。在过渡时期总任务照耀下，社会主义建设和社会主义改造正在逐步实现。抗美援朝的胜利，摧毁了敌人的破坏阴谋，壮大了我们的国防力量。日内瓦会议后，我们的国际地位更空前提高，和平力量的声势日益壮大，这就给我们国家工业化以更为有利的条件，增加了我们社会主义建设的保证。现在全国各地，到处蓬蓬勃勃地充满着建设的气氛，到处在搞基本建设，这对于一个建筑师来说，实在感觉万分兴奋。
    回想在反动派统治时期，我们作建筑师的是何等困难。从建筑系毕业开始，就有失业的威胁。想找一个实习机会亦不容易。全国仅有的若干建筑师还往往都找不到工作，更谈不到建筑艺术的创作。少数事务所幸而得到一点工程，又常常会停顿在图稿阶段，便归档完事。有些人苦闷之下就改了行。解放后，随着各种建设的发展，处处需要人才。学生一毕业就分配工作，还感到供不应求。有经验的建筑师们更是工作繁重，忙不过来。许多改行的又重新归了队。我们担负教学任务的同志们只恨没有“撒豆成兵”的本领，来供应国家在建筑方面所需要的人才。在旧社会中，建筑师的工作多半是设计和建筑一些零星的、为少数人享受的建筑物；解放后，才是大量的、为群众服务的公共建筑或者建筑群。而且在设计过程中，不再受顾客的个人好恶所支配，而以主人翁的态度进行其建筑艺术的创作。
    我们国家解放到现在，很短的五年当中，在建筑事业和城市规划方面已有了显著的成绩。但是任务繁重，人才不够；而各机构中建筑师接到的任务，亦还有些轻重缓急不平衡的现象。设计和施工常未能十分协调。有些城市建设尚未能充分作到有计划、有步骤、有重点的实施。一般建筑学专业均设置于工学院，而对其综合应用科学和应用美术的特殊性，往往照顾不够。为了配合国家在过渡时期总任务的要求，更好地使用人才，提高效率，使实际工作、教学工作同研究工作密切结合，似宜在首都筹设建筑学院，集中相当的建筑人才，由中央领导，除经常解决首都一些重要建筑问题之外，还可以有重点地、机动地支援全国各地处理特殊建筑问题。
    作为一个建筑师，我认识到建筑工作是一般基本建设中的一个重要环节，责任重大。建筑创作是反映社会的。民族形式和社会主义内容是我们建筑艺术创作的方向；但决不是生硬地搬用一些旧建筑的样式，滥用一片油漆彩画，就算交了差。我就犯过这种毛病，还犯过结构主义的错误。归根结底，都因为学习不够。要想作好这一工作，必须加紧学习，继续思想改造，肃清建筑工作中的片面观点和个人主义，配合有关各方面的同志，共同努力，为提前完成社会主义建设而奋斗！
    章乃器代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意周总理的报告和其他领导同志的发言，现在我补充说明一些有关粮食工作的情形和意见。
    （一）
    五年来，中国人民在中国共产党和中央人民政府的正确领导下，依靠自己的力量，学习苏联的先进经验，在粮食战线上取得了巨大的胜利。
    大家都会记得，各地解放以后首先面对着严重的粮食问题。中国人民相信自己有足够的力量来解决自己的问题。所以粮食经营的方针一开始就是：充分发掘粮食的潜在力量，统一全国的粮食调度，保证军粮民食，稳定粮价，为国民经济的恢复和发展创造有利条件。
    国家大力组织收购工作，用公道的价钱收购农民的余粮，包括许多边远地区过去私人无法贩运、农民无处出售的余粮，即所谓“死角粮”和“难运粮”。这样，“丰收成灾”和“谷贱伤农”的现象是一去不复返了。国家还大力组织全国规模的统一调运，把粮食运到需要的地点，以公道的价钱卖给消费者，并供应军队和国家工作人员。国家维持全年粮价的稳定，缩小城乡之间粮价的差距，基本上消除了过去青黄不接时期粮价飞涨的现象，限制了私商的剥削。这对于改善人民生活、稳定物价和提高工农业生产的积极性，是起了很大作用的。
      一九四九年的水灾是相当大的。国家从边远地方大力运粮支援灾区，共同战胜灾荒。
    我们扭转了五十多年来依赖洋米、洋麦进口的趋势，从一九五一年起米、麦反而可以有一些出口。各种粮食出口的数字是不大的，只占总产量的百分之一左右，而且绝大部分是豆类。这对于国家的工业建设是必需的，也是完全可能的。
    （二）
    中央粮食部于一九五二年九月成立，跟着，全国粮食机构统一了，力量进一步集中了。一九五三年春天开始，情况发生了显著的改变，过去行之有效的利用自由市场进行斗争的方式从基层开始遭遇到困难。本来，人民生活的提高首先就要多吃粮食；个体农民有一些家底子，首先也要多储藏一些粮食。自由市场的存在，使得这种情况变成了广泛的投机活动。当时我们又遭遇到一些水旱灾和几十年来未曾有过的霜灾。奸商、富农便乘机勾结小贩，一面向农民争购粮食，一面混杂在需粮群众当中套购国家粮食，造成了许多基层售粮点的脱销，造成了黑市，助长了农民惜售粮食思想的发展。反映到总的购销数字上，是购少销多的形势日益严重，国家粮食库存消耗日大。大中城市粮食市场虽然一般是稳定的，但回流到农村去的粮食，数量日益增多。
    这种情况决不是偶然的。这是我们走向社会主义社会、进入计划时代必然会遇到的问题。问题的本质是反映了国家计划经济同小农经济和自由市场之间的矛盾，反映了社会主义工业化的道路同农民自发势力和资产阶级反限制的资本主义道路的矛盾；归根到底，是反映了社会主义因素同资本主义因素之间的矛盾。问题具有如此重大的根本性，解决问题的方法就必须从根本入手。国家除在生产方面大力促进农业的合作化和技术改良以增产粮食外，还必须在流通方面实行粮食的计划收购、计划供应，即统购统销的政策和市场管理的政策，以消灭粮食投机，克服粮食浪费。
    新的政策自从去年十一月开始实行后，在国家过渡时期总任务的宣传教育的伟大影响下，由于中国共产党和人民政府的正确领导，全体干部的努力和广大人民群众的积极拥护，很快地就扭转了整个的局势。收购的数字增加了，一九五三年七月至一九五四年六月（粮食年度）的收购数字比上年度增加了百分之七十七点七八，今年六月底的库存比去年同期增加了百分之五十一；私营粮食工商业得到了改造；各地设立了国家粮食市场，以补助统购统销之不足。粮食统购统销还对农业的合作化和对农民的生产积极性起了推动和鼓舞的作用。有了这些胜利，我们才有足够的力量应付今年的水灾。
    粮食统购统销和市场管理，是一系列非常繁重而复杂的工作。统购工作面对着广大的农民，其中绝大部分又是个体农民。统销工作需要保证居住在城、镇、工矿区的人口的全部口粮，和分散在经济作物区、缺粮区、灾区的人口的部分口粮；此外还须适当满足熟食业、复制业和流动人口的需要，适当照顾饲料和调剂籽种。而我们去年是在完全没有经验和时间紧迫、准备不够充分的条件下开始这一系列工作的，因此便发生了不少的缺点和错误。在统购中，发生了一些强迫命令的行为，也发生了一些束手束足、不积极执行国家法令的情况；同时，该少购而多购和该多购而少购的情况各地均有发现。在统销中，许多地方发生了供应过少过多、供应不及时等现象。有些地方供应手续过于繁琐；有些地方对熟食业、复制业和流动人口供应不足。许多地方统购和统销结合不够，忙于收购就放松了供应。有些地方收购点和供应点的分布不合理，或者过密，或者过疏。有些地方在粮食验收等级的掌握上，有偏松偏紧和此松彼紧的现象。许多地方对国家粮食市场的作用认识不够，没有明确它是统购统销政策不可缺少的一个助手，同时也只能是一个助手。因此，有些地方市场分布不够或不合理；市场管理也有偏松偏紧情况，许多市场未起应有的作用。部分私商、小贩还有非法活动，部分私营代销店也还有违法、消极的行为。
    造成以上缺点和错误的主要原因，在于我们对粮食情况掌握不够，而广大农民的粮食情况是很复杂的。这也说明了我们中央粮食部的领导能力还很差，因而各地粮食部门的业务水平还远赶不上客观形势的要求。现在，这方面的工作已在不断改进。相信今后逐步总结经验、加紧培养训练干部、加强调查统计工作，随着农业合作化的发展，工作是可以逐步做到完善的。
    （三）
    五年来，粮食生产是逐年增长的，但还赶不上国家和人民日益增长的需要。因此，在相当长的时期内，粮食供需的形势还是很紧的，经验证明，实行粮食统购统销和市场管理的政策，提倡节约，粮食还是够用的。统购统销工作必须逐步制定明确具体的制度，必须积极提高计划的正确性，使工作干部和人民都可以按制度、按计划办事。这正是宪法对于我们的要求。
    解放台湾是中国人民的历史任务，这是一场艰巨、复杂的斗争。我们必须准备在任何的情况下，保证军粮民食的供应，继续稳定粮价。我们一定可以胜利完成这一光荣的任务。
    今年我们遭遇到了百多年来少有的洪水，虽然有部分地区受灾，但是广大的非灾区却获得丰收，全国粮食反而可以比去年增产，粮源是不缺的。为支援灾区，国家将大力加强收购和调运工作，但是，由于地区之间的产销平衡和粮种之间的比例起了很大的变化，调度上的困难是很多的。因此，必须依靠全国人民节约粮食；为便利国家调度复杂的粮种，还须提倡“有啥吃啥”。五年来，中国人民已经战胜了两次相当大的灾荒，我们完全有力量有信心战胜今年的灾荒。
    国家经营粮食在目前还是赔钱的。这在过去，由于我们必须在自由市场同投机商人作艰巨的斗争，赔钱是不可避免的，统购统销已经改变了这一形势。今后在收购边远地区粮食、运粮救灾和供应经济作物区各方面，还须赔钱，但情况已经比较易于掌握。我们已经有条件可以积极推行经济核算，逐步推行合理运输，努力减低费用，争取早日做到由少赔而不赔。
    粮食保管由于干部的努力和人民群众的帮助，霉坏的损失率已经大大减低。去年和今年还出现了一批无虫仓和无霉仓，目前正在全面推广这些仓库的先进经验。但仍然还有不少的落后仓库，继续发生不应有的损失；同时，还发生了不少账目混乱、财产不清等严重情况；也还有个别的隐瞒损失、盗窃等违法乱纪的行为。去冬对粮食实行统购统销后，由于中共各级地方组织和各地人民政府重视粮食工作，检察署、监委、公安等部门大力协助，这些坏情况已有很大改善。目前我们正在业务方面努力改进收付制度，健全责任制，推广定额管理和拟定奖惩办法，以巩固与提高既得的成绩。几年来，仓库建筑进展得很快，但存粮数字增长得更快；因此很多粮食仍然存放在露天和民房里，这个问题还须今后大力逐步加以解决。
    粮食加工的出品率已经提高了不少。但机器设备一般很陈旧，技术人员很缺。因此，粮食中的去砂去杂问题，虽在积极推广苏联先进经验，力求改进，仍难令人满意。加工厂的分布很不合理，造成了运输上的浪费，委托加工中也还存在着一些盗窃、浪费国家资财的情况，今后必须结合对私营加工厂的社会主义改造，逐步加以调整和纠正。
    粮食工作还要走一段漫长的艰巨的道路，我们完全没有满足于现状的理由。粮食工作的目的是要用更充分的、更清洁卫生的、新鲜适口的粮食供应人民；但这一目的，是只能在粮食生产不断增长和技术设备不断改进的基础上经过我们不断的努力才能逐步达到的。在此期间，为应付意外灾害，必须充实粮食储备；为增加生产和改进技术，还必须为国家积累资金。这又都是需要广大人民群众的积极支持的。因此，节约粮食应该成为人人遵守的社会公德，成为积极执行宪法的主要标志之一。
    为建设社会主义社会，我们必须做好粮食工作。在伟大的毛泽东时代，在伟大的宪法光芒的照耀下，只要我们善于接受领导，服从法纪，依靠群众，不麻痹，不自满，不保守，不冒进，积极努力，用心学习，不断改进，工作是一定可以做好的。
    请求各位代表给我们以严格的批评，并在工作上给我们以不断的帮助和监督。
    巴金代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    站在这个讲台上，我感到万分紧张，因为六万万人民在倾听从这里发出的声音。
    我听了周恩来总理的政府工作报告，非常兴奋。这个报告又真实又正确地总结了我们国家五年来各方面的辉煌的成就。这些成就都是全国人民亲眼看见的。这五年来在我们每个人的四周不断地发生新的变化。不必依靠数字，谁都可以举出几件事实来说明国家的飞跃的进步。长期受压迫、被奴役的中国人民站起来了，在自己的丰饶、广大的土地上做了主人，结束了过去受冻挨饿的痛苦日子。六万万人民团结成一个整体，用忘我的劳动，参加祖国的建设。在我们国家里，每一双手都在动，每一个脑子都在思索，每一颗心都充满着爱，每盏灯都发光，每块炭都发热，每个齿轮都在转动，每样工具都在使用。这一切都是为着一个共同的理想，一个共同的事业。在一个统一的计划下面，从南到北，从东到西，哪一个地方不在改变？哪一个地方没有斧头和铁锤的声音？哪一处听不见笑声、歌声？哪一天看不到新人、新事？对四川人民来说再没有比听见成渝路上火车的放汽声更令人感动的事了。还有哪一个政府能够在这么短的时间就实现了四川人民四十年的愿望？
    今天我们国家已经成为一个强大的独立国家，而且正以无敌的力量向着繁荣、幸福的社会主义社会迈进。面对着这个伟大的现实，我们文学工作者固然感到非常兴奋，但同时也感到万分惭愧。我们不能否认这五年来在文学部门中也曾产生若干为人民群众喜爱的作品，这些作品也或多或少地反映了我们国家那些惊天动地的大变化，也创造出一些有高贵品质的英雄人物的艺术形象。但是这一点成就是配不上新中国的整个局面的。王芸生代表在大会发言中提到“在文化部门尤其缺少创造性的工作，小说、剧本少得可怜”，这正说明了今天文学艺术落后的现象。我们生活在人民中间，跟人民一同欢笑，一同前进，却没有充分地表现出人民的欢乐、热爱和团结一致的感情。这个光辉的时代反映在我们的作品中也显得黯淡无光。我们的作品常常因为作者想做到四平八稳、照顾周到、人人满意，而变成既不生动又无力量的东西。这些年来有多少文学工作者写过像王芸生代表所说的“干干巴巴缺少情感的文章”？我自己就是其中的一个。倘使我们不能克服我们的缺点，我们就会被读者抛弃。
    我们的缺点的确不少：我们一方面没有用充分的热情歌颂我们国家的新人新事；另一方面对我们社会中一些不健康的落后的现象也没有及时揭露和批评。谁都知道在我们国家里充满了新鲜的、光明的东西，但旧社会遗留下来的腐朽的、垂死的东西并没有全部消灭。这些东西在新的力量的打击下还时时抬起头来作最后的挣扎。而我们一部分国家机关工作中存在着的官僚主义正好帮忙延长了它们的寿命。有的代表在大会发言中一再提到官僚主义。的确官僚主义不是经过一反再反就会绝迹的。今天我们还常常从人民口中听到官僚主义的故事，仿佛在读果戈理、谢德林的小说。例如，有些干部来自人民中间，却喜欢把自己关在办公室内，在文牍中消磨日子。还有一些干部忘记自己是人民的勤务员，只喜欢听奉承，不高兴听批评，对人民的意见也常常不加考虑。也有一些领导部门常常不经过详细调查、全面研究，单凭主观愿望作出决定，发布命令；下级就机械地执行，也不反映真实情况，更不考虑这种办法是否对国家和人民有益。……这些事实虽然给我们国家和人民带来若干损失，但是我们政府在人民群众中的威信并未因此而减少。人民的眼睛是雪亮的。党和政府一再号召全国人民用批评和自我批评的武器跟一切不良的倾向作斗争，我们文学工作者更应该用自己的笔来展开这种批评和自我批评，协助政府克服各种落后的现象。在宪法实施以后，我们的政府一定更有办法把旧社会残留下来的坏现象彻底肃清。
    各位代表，我们从各个不同的地区来到北京，我们都记得我们动身时的情景：多少只手紧紧握着我们的手，多少亲切的眼光望着我们，多少激动的声音向我们嘱咐。我们把六万万人民的心带进会场，我们不会忘记六万万人民的共同愿望：为国家安排一个光芒万丈的前途，为子孙安排一个无限美好的将来。我们的工作是庄严的，我们的工作也是艰巨的。回顾了过去五年来的光辉灿烂的成就，再看到全国人民庆祝中华人民共和国宪法诞生的欢腾的景象，我们对我们的工作更有了信心。六万万人民的共同愿望是一定会实现的。作为人民的代表，我们必须把整个心献给人民。全心全意为人民的事业奋斗，这是人生最美丽、最光荣的事情。
    刘导生代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    五年以来，中国共产党和人民政府领导全国人民进行了巨大的工作，并特别关怀和教育青年成为社会主义建设的新的一代。我们衷心地感谢党和人民政府，感谢我们敬爱的领袖和导师毛主席。
    目前，在教育青年的工作上，还有几个问题值得重视。
    第一，学校是教育青年的重要场所，几年来我国学生的数字上升很快，并已给各个建设岗位培养了不少人材，这应当向我们的几百万人民教师表示感谢。但是，教学质量不高仍然是学校教育中一个带普遍性的问题。我们有些教育行政人员往往只注意管人管钱，还没有集中主要精力去管好教学工作。我们认为政府教育部门和学校当局应当认真地把这些事情办好，有计划地指导教师的进修。切实地减轻他们的社会工作负担，让他们有更多的时间备课和学习。教师是学生的表率，教师的品德对学生有极大的影响，因此，对他们应加强政治思想领导，对成绩优异的教师应予以及时的表扬和奖励，对个别品质恶劣的分子，应予严肃的处理。另外，希望政府文教部门要下决心集中人力改进现有的教材，并首先编出一套较好的中小学教材。在学校中青年团的组织更有责任协助搞好教学，团结同学严格遵守学习纪律，动员各方面的力量把学校办好。
    第二，几年来，由于全国作家和广大文艺工作者的努力，我们已经有了许多优秀的文艺作品，对教育青年起了极大的作用。但是，能够反映我们人民当前斗争生活、鼓舞青年斗志的作品还是太少，我国戏曲中所反映的许多历史上人民斗争的事迹还没有充分的发扬。青年们渴望供给他们好的歌曲、舞蹈和独幕剧。这些方面，确是需要我们作更大的努力。我们希望政府考虑适当的评奖办法，从各方面来鼓励文学艺术的创作，并要提倡关心和爱护新作品的风气，凡是好的有教育意义的，受到群众欢迎的东西，就要广为介绍和组织评论，帮助作家再进一步提高。我国的创作力量还是很薄弱的，因此，培养青年作家的问题，更是有关的文化工作部门和青年团的重大责任。
    第三，图书的出版是党和国家对人民进行政治、思想、文化教育的工具，是思想战线上的有力武器之一。五年来我们出版了不少青年、少年和儿童的读物，广泛地教育了正在成长中的一代。现在的严重问题是：供给工农青年学习政治、文化的通俗读物十分不够。就是有一些好书，因为发行工作上的缺陷，也不能真正深入到工农群众中去。同时，一般青年迫切需要的马克思列宁主义和文化、科学知识的入门读物也极其缺乏，儿童读物的贫乏更是严重。这都亟需国家出版机关和作家共同努力，来求得解决。青年团在这方面也要尽力帮助作家和出版社，经常反映青年群众的要求，并加强对青年阅读的指导和组织工作。据我们所知，私营出版业一九五二年比一九五○年增加近二百家，他们之中有许多并没有什么编辑力量，凭借着剪刀浆糊粗制滥造，出的书不仅思想水平很低，而且有的曲解国家的政策，散布落后思想，诲淫诲盗。对这些投机的出版社是不能容忍其继续毒害青年的，我们建议政府坚决加以整顿。
    各位代表，毛主席已经向全国人民指出了前进的方向，周恩来总理也提出了我们当前的工作任务，我们全国青年一定为其实现而努力奋斗！
    陶峙岳代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我以无限欢欣鼓舞的心情，对周恩来总理所作的政府工作报告，表示竭诚拥护。
    中华人民共和国成立以来的五年中，我们祖国人民在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席英明正确的领导下，在各个战线上所取得的伟大胜利和成就，是史无前例的。我国无数志士仁人多少年来所梦寐以求的理想，已经成为活生生的现实。在这样一个伟大历史时期，我能够光荣地参加工作，真是说不尽的感谢和愉快。
    中国人民解放军新疆军区部队，五年以来，担负着保卫祖国、建设祖国的双重任务。我们在守卫着祖国边疆，同时，还遵循着中国共产党和毛主席的指示，执行军队参加生产的光荣任务。整个生产工作的过程，是与自然作斗争的过程，也是学习技术的过程。由于党和政府的正确领导和大力支持，以及全体指挥员、战斗员的忘我劳动，我们已获得很大的成绩。在过去四年中，我们兴修了若干水利工程，收获了二十八万六千多吨粮食，逐步提高了各种作物的单位面积产量。玛纳斯河垦区的两万多亩棉田，创造了每亩平均产四百零二斤籽棉的丰产纪录。我们收获的棉花，已开始运到上海，支援国家工业生产。其他工程建筑、交通运输和副业生产，也有很大的发展。但同时我们在工作中还存在不少缺点和错误。我们某些生产部队的少数人员，在执行民族政策和群众纪律上还不够严肃和认真，在处理军队同群众有关土地、水利、牧场和草场等问题上，曾发生不照顾群众利益甚至侵犯群众利益的现象。对各项生产的经营管理和科学技术的学习，还赶不上生产发展的需要，损失和浪费的现象还很严重。这些缺点和错误，有的已经纠正过来，有的还有待于今后大力加以克服。在祖国正在进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造的伟大时期，我们深深感到自己在支援国家建设、加强国防力量当中，能够分担一分工作，贡献一分力量，是我们莫大的光荣。今后我们一定要继续加强同新疆各族人民的团结，以便克服缺点，战胜困难，更好地完成保卫祖国和生产建设的任务。
    由于新疆自然环境的优越，土地广大，土壤肥沃，农业生产的潜在力很大。特别对于棉花的种植，具有很大的前途。棉花的生长条件是所谓“头顶太阳，脚踏湿地”，新疆的气候是最适宜的。只要能够解决水利问题，就可以扩大棉田的面积，并取得良好的收成。中央这几年来在新疆水利建设上，已经兴办了许多工程；今后在可能范围之内，除了部队本身力量以外，希望再给以适当的支持，就可以达到大量增产棉花的目的。这对于国家纺织工业的发展是有帮助的。
    今天我能够有机会在代表六亿人民的庄严的全国人民代表大会会议上发言，感到万分兴奋。我在新疆和平解放以前，曾经长期为蒋介石卖国集团服务。自投入革命以后，通过五年来现实的深刻的教育，深深体会到中国共产党的伟大。由于共产党的宽大和教育，使我获得了光明前途，这是我永远不能忘记的。
    现在蒋介石卖国集团仍然在美帝国主义庇护之下，盘踞台湾，继续作恶，这是全国人民绝对不能容忍的。我国神圣的领土台湾一天不解放，蒋介石卖国集团一天不彻底消灭，我们伟大的解放事业就没有最后完成。我们坚决同全国人民一道，为完成解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团的光荣任务而奋斗到底。
    谢富治代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意和拥护周总理所作的政府工作报告。这个报告中所总结的全国工作的经验，同样地总结了云南工作的基本经验。
    云南地处祖国边疆，又是一个多民族的省份，作好民族团结和巩固边疆工作，就成为云南各省工作中最重要的任务。过去几年由于坚决执行了中央的民族政策，全省二十多个在经济、文化及其他许多方面发展极不平衡的兄弟民族，团结在祖国的大家庭中，共同执行中央指示和本地的各项工作任务。这就使得由于以往帝国主义和国民党匪帮所制造的民族仇恨、民族压迫而带来的各族人民的悲惨、无权的生活，一去不返了。新的事实是，各民族实行了区域自治，有了当家作主的权利；民族团结和互相信任日益增长；生产中的“刀耕火种”的落后情况已在改变；人民收入增加，生活已较前改善；许多边疆地区，已经是用肥沃的土地、广大的森林的概念，代替了历史上所谓著名云南瘴气区的概念了。当然，所有这些还仅是工作的开端，今后要在全省范围内，在这样一个全省各县都包括有几个民族的广大地区，使各个不同民族都按照宪法的规定，而又完全切合当地各民族的实际情况，稳步地共同过渡到社会主义，是十分艰巨的历史任务。如不认真克服我们工作中——首先是在民族团结工作中的缺点，并不断地同各种错误思想作斗争，实现这个任务是没有保证的。我们工作中现存的缺点是很多的，例如大量培养和提拔少数民族干部的工作仍做得不够，对于现有的一万一千多个各少数民族干部还缺少更有计划的训练教育；在执行政策上有时离开原有的工作基础，机械地搬用汉族地区的方法，不善于采用各族人民喜闻乐见的方式进行工作，因而表现急躁冒进；或者忽视少数民族中社会的进步因素的增长，见不到几年来工作的成绩所产生的影响和变化，因而消极地对待若干必需的和可能进行的工作；一部分汉族干部，不尊重少数民族的风俗习惯，不能耐心地热情地帮助和依靠少数民族群众，在团结民族公众领袖上也表现有不正确的态度。这些大民族主义思想以及在一部分少数民族干部中存在着的地方民族主义思想，都是妨害上述任务的实现的，都必须经过教育、批评和严肃的斗争，切实予以纠正。
    云南又是一个解放较晚、工作基础较为薄弱的地区，在这样的情况下，要同全国一道去胜利地执行伟大的社会主义工业化和对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的任务，就更需要积极谨慎，既不拖延，也不急躁；就必须在中央集中统一领导下，格外努力；就必须去同目前建设工作中的缺点和错误进行斗争。
    首先是在工业生产和基本建设方面，有不少干部对于依靠工人阶级和全面地均衡地完成国家计划的思想还不够明确，工作中稍见成效就自满起来。建筑工程浪费返工和违反施工程序的现象十分严重；昆明有的生产单位，工作时好时坏，一出现自满情绪就不能完成生产计划，或者产品质量极差。在对农业进行社会主义改造方面，互助合作运动虽已见成效，极为劳动农民所欢迎；但是尚未广泛开展起来，农村中资本主义自发势力也尚未受到应有的限制。在其他工作方面和干部的作风方面也有缺点。所有这些，都是和省级领导机关领导上的缺点分不开的。
    为了克服云南工作中的这些缺点，顺利地执行国家所赋予的任务，全省各族人民必须根据宪法的规定，结合当地情况，进一步加强团结，共同努力；全体国家机关工作人员，首先是领导干部，必须充分地进行批评和自我批评，及时克服自己工作中的各种错误和缺点，时刻记住毛主席“戒骄戒躁，谦虚谨慎”的指示，紧密依靠各族人民群众，兢兢业业地做好各项工作。
    李任仁代表的发言主席，诸位代表：
    我听了周恩来总理的政府工作报告，感到万分兴奋。建国短短五年间，国家在各个方面成就之大，超过历史上任何一个时期。现在正依照国家过渡时期总任务所指示的道路，胜利地开展着有计划的国民经济建设，稳步前进，为建设光明、幸福的社会主义新中国而奋斗。我们衷心感谢中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，竭诚拥护中央人民政府正确的政策方针。
    人民政府五年来的工作，成绩是主要的。但某些国家机关工作人员在执行政策中间，仍然存在着一些缺点。比如：有些地方粮食统购统销，没有完全办好，口粮同余粮不加区别一并收购。有些地方农村的计划供应也未及时实行，或者不切合实际需要，有的买多了，有的得少了，甚至一时买不到的也有，以致造成食粮供求失调的现象。还有一些仓库管理不善，霉坏储粮，造成国家的损失，这些都是群众感到不满意的。我们知道，党和人民政府的政策方针是完全正确的，领导也是极其坚强的，何以会发生这些缺点呢？主要原因是由于我们各方面的工作迅速开展，成就显著，部分国家机关的基层工作人员因胜利而产生骄傲自满情绪，又因赶任务而产生强迫命令作风，不认真钻研政策，也不虚心倾听群众意见，没有做到勤勤恳恳、兢兢业业地为人民服务。又如：组织农业生产合作社和供销合作社，也有些干部单纯满足于数量上的发展，没有加强领导，着重巩固工作，致使部分合作社的基础不巩固，这是会在农民中间引起怀疑和产生不良影响的。同时，基层国家机关工作人员的缺点和上级领导机关有联带关系，有些上级领导机关也存在着或多或少的官僚主义，既未经常主动检查所属机关的工作，又不注意紧密联系人民群众，依靠群众力量的监督，随时揭露和纠正所属机关工作中的缺点。就在这样情况之下，一些工作人员的骄傲自满情绪获得滋长的机会，结果把好事办成坏事。
    毫无疑问，这些工作中的缺点必须加以纠正，也是能够纠正的。因为我们有中国共产党和中央人民政府的坚强领导，现在又有了作为国家机关工作人员最高准则的宪法，那些不努力为人民服务，不走群众路线，不守劳动纪律的人，都要受到法律的监督或制裁。再加上开好基层人民代表大会会议，通过会议经常同人民群众的代表人物商量办事，接受群众监督、帮助检查工作；同时国家机关也加强干部教育，树立民主和守法的观念。我相信，这样各方面配合起来，所有工作中出现过的缺点，今后完全可以得到克服。
    此外，我对广西省经济设施方面有两点意见：（一）希望政府规划进行建设时充分注意区域特点。如广西荒地很多，又属亚热带地带，除发展农业以外，尤宜于大规模发展畜牧和造林；东京湾为世界著名渔场，属于我国的领海海面甚广，政府似宜结合这些特点加以考虑，在广西投资发展渔牧事业。（二）广西矿产甚多，土产和特产亦不少。希望政府改进运输调配工作，使广西目前物产能及时运出；又生产资料中的肥料之类，生活资料中的工业品，各地人民需要供应，在很大的程度上要依靠国家统筹调配，因此希望政府主管机关迅速改进运输调配工作，做好调查准备，使调运力求及时，供应力求适合需要。这两点希望，是广西省人民群众当前的迫切愿望，也是同国家经济政策的基本精神相符合的。
    最后，我建议大会通过政府工作报告。并愿为广泛传达、贯彻执行而努力。
    罗祥根代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我们农民在旧社会里是被剥削、被压迫的人。今天我能当代表来参加全国人民代表大会会议，感到无限的兴奋和光荣。农民参加管理国家大事，只有在共产党和毛主席的领导下才有可能。我万分感谢共产党，感谢毛主席！
    我完全同意和拥护周总理的报告。根据五年来的亲身体会，对比解放前的苦难日子，我认为周总理的报告是完全正确的。我是浙江慈溪县岐山乡五洞闸高级农业生产合作社主任。我们五洞闸村农民同别处农民一样，解放前受尽地主恶霸的剥削和压迫，加上海塘年久失修，海水时常冲垮海塘，淹没棉田，农民们的生活不如牛马。解放后共产党和人民政府领导我们打倒了地主，分得了土地，农民翻身做了主人。土地改革后，共产党同人民政府又领导农民组织互助组和合作社，修理海塘和五洞闸闸门。因此，生产有了显著发展。我们这个社是一九五二年春成立的，开头只有十四户，去年扩大到五十五户，今年扩大到八十八户。由于组织起来，采用了按劳付酬的分配办法，发挥了社员劳动积极性和创造性，改进技术和兴修水利的结果，产量年年提高。解放前我们村里每亩棉田平均只收籽棉一百斤左右，一九五一年每亩收一百二十斤，一九五二年合作社组织起来后，每亩收一百六十斤。一九五三年碰到几十年未见过的大旱，但是由于共产党和人民政府领导得好，我们战胜了旱灾，产量还是增加，每亩平均收两百零九斤。解放前棉花收获时，奸商乘机压价，如抗日战争期间有一年最低时压到一斤皮棉只值一斤大米。现在人民政府规定的棉粮比价很合理，保证了棉农的合理收入，人民政府关心农民真是无微不至。为了支援国家工业建设，我们社里收的棉花除了自用外全部都卖给国家，去年卖给国家的有九万三千多斤。
    生产发展了，社员收入增加了，生活也有了显著的改善。有个社员叫应伯荣，一家六口，解放前两个兄弟去当雇工，一家吃不饱、穿不暖，还背了一身债。解放后，分到了土地，又参加了合作社，单去年一年就收入一千零二十九万元，折合稻谷一万三千多斤，生活过得蛮好，债也还清了。社员沈祖恒，虽然是中农，解放前生活也很困苦，入社后收入有了增加，去年收入是六百六十九万元。我们社里还办了识字班，社员文化提高不少。解放前村里没有小学，解放后办起了一个小学。五年来的事实教育了我们，农民要摆脱穷困走向富裕，只有走社会主义的道路。附近农民兄弟都说：“五洞闸农业合作社的路走对了！”“听毛主席的话不会错！”他们纷纷要参加我们的合作社或者自己成立合作社。今年冬季，我们岐山乡全乡农民就要统统组织起来了。
    但是我们社里还有许多缺点，譬如在改进技术方面不少社员还有保守思想，社里对副业生产还管理得不好。这些都要想办法改进，必须向别的社学习，把社办好。
    五年来，对共产党和人民政府的领导，农民是满意的，大家对共产党和人民政府感激不尽，是很自然的。中国农民要克服穷困和落后，除了走社会主义的道路，是没有别的路可走的。
    这次开了会回去，我一定坚决执行周总理报告中所指出的方针，从我们自己的工作岗位上来支援国家工业化，把合作社办好，把乡里的工作做好。浙江处在国防前线，我们慈溪县又在海边，我们支援解放军巩固国防、解放台湾的责任特别重大。我们保证搞好生产，大力支援解放军，为消灭蒋介石卖国集团，解放台湾而斗争到底。
    贾拓夫代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全拥护周恩来总理关于政府工作的报告。现在我想对国营工业企业的管理工作发表一些意见。
    国营工业企业经过三年恢复和将近两年建设期间的一系列的改革和工作，其中主要是民主改革和生产改革，实行计划管理、建立责任制度和改进技术管理等工作，已经取得了很大的成绩，由此积累了经验，培养了干部，并在工业的基本建设方面结集了一批地质、设计和建筑、安装的力量，从而奠定了社会主义工业生产管理的初步基础，并为大规模的基本建设创造了条件。但无可否认，由于工业企业管理和工业基本建设是一件极复杂的工作，我们还缺乏管理和建设大工业的经验，而旧中国对我国丰富的资源，并未进行认真的勘探，所留下的统计和技术资料又非常贫乏，特别是由于我们在工作中还学习得不够，还存在着一些严重的缺点和错误，所以目前我们工业企业的领导和管理水平，还落后于工业的迅速发展和大规模建设的需要。
    国家首先要求我们的一切国营工业企业部门都能根据国家总的计划制定本部门先进而又可靠的计划，作为自己进行经济活动的准则。一九五三年中央各工业部门一般地都完成或超额完成了国家计划。一九五四年的计划预计也可完成或超额完成。中央重工业部、燃料工业部、第一机械工业部、第二机械工业部、轻工业部和纺织工业部等六个部的工业总产值，一九五四年预计较一九五二年将增长百分之五十七左右，这些工业部门所生产的主要工业产品，一九五四年较一九五二年，预计增长的百分数如下：电力百分之五十一，原煤百分之二十六，石油百分之九十，生铁百分之五十七，钢百分之五十九，钢材百分之四十三，水泥百分之六十，金属切削机床百分之三十七，棉纱百分之二十七，纸百分之二十九，糖百分之七十一，卷烟百分之七十四。这些产品的质量，一般都有不同程度的提高，新产品的试制和生产也在逐年增加，如今年中央四个工业部列入计划试制的新产品有一千多种。一九五三年上述六个工业部工人的劳动生产率较一九五二年提高了百分之十四点三。一九五四年比一九五三年预计将增长百分之十点六。产品的成本逐年下降，以五个工业部（第二机械工业部在外）计算，一九五三年比一九五二年降低了百分之三点二。上述六个工业部上缴国家的利润和折旧在一九五三年为二十万亿元以上，一九五四年预计将增加为二十九万亿元以上。这六个工业部的基本建设投资总额一九五三年较一九五二年增长了百分之一百零六，一九五四年预计较一九五三年增长百分之二十点五。中央地质部、重工业部和燃料工业部从一九五二年至一九五四年上半年止，共计进行了地质测量二十一万多平方公里，钻探一百七十四万多公尺，从而获得了一定的成果。一九五四年上半年五个工业部完成了全年生产计划的百分之五十二，而去年同期则仅完成百分之四十七，说明这些部门的生产均衡性有了进步；能够按期完成国家计划的企业单位，一九五四年上半年比去年同期也有增加，如轻工业部一百一十六个企业中，有八十六个企业完成和超额完成了计划，其中能按月完成计划的由去年上半年的十七个企业增加到今年上半年的四十一个企业。上述种种，都是说明国营工业、首先是中央国营工业在五年计划的头两年中执行的情况是比较好的。但是缺点和问题还是不少。有些部门和企业在编制生产计划时习惯于采用陈旧的定额，或预留所谓“后备”，这样它们就能比较容易地超额完成计划，而将自己落后和保守的一面掩盖起来，结果这样的计划就失去指导生产前进的作用。有些部门和企业在编制计划时，对于生产和需要的平衡调查得不够，对新产品的发展努力不够，生产部门和用货部门配合得不好，因而发生某些供产销脱节的现象。例如普通的和中小型的工作母机、电动机、变压器等都有一些积压，现在尚未处理完毕。轻工业部所属的华东五个制药厂今年上半年生产的片剂、针剂等药品积压的约值四百亿元。还有许多部门在完成计划中是不全面、不均衡的，虽然从总数上看超额完成了计划，但常有相当数量的企业不能完成计划或不能全面完成计划。例如就管理水平较好的重工业部来说，今年上半年，未完成生产总值计划的，平均每六个企业中就有一个企业；约有百分之三十的企业经常在技术经济定额、成本、劳动、财务等项指标上不能全面完成计划；不能按月完成计划的有百分之五十六的企业，甚至有个别企业，全月的计划任务在上旬中旬只完成一半，而把另一半推到下旬完成；煤矿和有色金属在开采矿石前的开拓工作，常常落后于矿石的采掘，例如煤矿在一九五三年上半年只完成掘进计划的百分之八十四，而一九五四年第二季度末实有工作面长度也只达到计划的百分之八十二，这就形成了生产上前松后紧或互不配合的不均衡状态，使企业的生产能力不能获得充分地利用。在基本建设方面：有些部门在编制计划时，没有很好地贯彻重点建设的方针，对投资的经济效果注意不够，甚至对不急需的非生产的投资也用多了；有些部门在单位工程的投资计划上存在着“宽打窄用”的思想，因而发生高估工料费用的现象；在完成基本建设计划方面，有些单位由于计划不周，勘察设计工作和施工进度不能很好衔接，时而招收大量工人突击赶工，时而又产生窝工现象。这些都是说明目前我们工业计划工作还存在着不少的缺点。
    克服这些缺点的主要办法，必须加强现有计划工作人员的政治业务教育，提高计划工作的水平，使他们能够领会国家在过渡时期的总任务和各项政策方针，做为编制计划时的依据。必须加强工业企业的统计工作，经常研究先进生产者的成就，以便在编制计划时能够依据正确的统计资料，掌握平均先进定额，制定先进而又现实的计划。在编制基本建设计划时，必须使施工进度和勘察设计工作，国内国外设备的供应，技术人员和技术工人的调配等方面密切配合，在编制生产计划时，必须根据需要和可能对供产销进行反复的平衡计算，并加强物资分配机构和供销机构的工作，以便使供产销之间更好的结合。在厂矿企业更应注意编好作业计划，加强调度工作，以便均衡地进行生产。同时，必须按日、按旬、按月、按季检查计划的执行情况，在全体职工中，树立全面地均衡地完成国家计划的思想。只有这样，才能把我们工业企业和建设单位的计划工作提高一步。
    国家要求我们一切工业企业部门，不仅在产值和产品的数量上完成国家计划，而且必须在产品的质量上完成计划指标，保证以优良的合格的产品供应国家建设和人民需要，保证我们的建设工程按照严格的技术要求和一定的质量标准进行。几年来许多工业企业部门为了提高自己的产品和工程质量，是努力的，有成绩的，但是还有许多产品和工程质量经不起严格的检查，有些更是不合格的，或不稳定的。例如轻工业部造纸局十八个企业今年四月份曾有十三个企业没有完成合格率计划；第一机械工业部所属沈阳矿山机器厂在今年四月份内铸铁件废品率曾达到百分之四十九以上，五月份仍在百分之四十左右；重工业部所属鞍钢炼铁厂的炼钢生铁的一级品率，在今年一月至五月期间仅为百分之八十六点九，比计划低了百分之四点一。特别值得提出的是：国家建设和人民生活要求我们出产大量的多种多样的新种类产品，但我们对新产品的试制或制造的进度还赶不上需要。例如目前国内生产的钢材的品种和规格，比起建设的需要来说，还相差甚远；国内供应的机械设备在数量上目前还仅能供应需要的一半左右，而且大多数还不是大型的和精密的。假如我们不能迅速地采取措施来逐步解决这个问题，就必然要使我们今后的建设和生产发生很大的困难。我们在生产或建设中经常发生设备或人身事故。中央六个工业部今年一月至五月发生了较大的人身事故达二百六十三次，死亡达二百九十六人。设备事故以燃料工业部电业系统说，今年一月至五月发生停电事故共达二千三百八十九次，少送电二百九十七万度。重工业部钢铁系统今年上半年内有几个高炉发生结瘤、挂料事故，以致在上述期间全国高炉少出产生铁约五万吨。第一机械工业部所属工厂今年一月至六月因设备事故停工就达十三万多台时。在基本建设方面存在的主要问题是技术力量赶不上工作发展的需要，地质勘察和设计力量都不足，质量不高，组织得也不好，因而往往落后于施工的要求，而施工组织方面的一般情况是土木建筑的施工力量和金属结构及设备安装的施工力量不平衡。例如东北地区四十三个国营承包企业今年三月实有工人十万人，投入施工现场者为百分之六十三，当时却缺少铆工、电焊、锅炉、氧焊等特殊工种的工人五千多人。在施工中常常发生质量和返工事故。例如中央建筑工程部承建的第一汽车制造厂热电站工程七十九个柱基有三十二个或大或小发生了些质量事故，这样不仅影响预定的建设进度，而且影响某些工程的质量。所有上述一切，集中地说明了目前我们技术力量不足和技术水平不高，特别是我们在技术管理方面，还有不少的缺点。
    克服这一缺点的主要办法是：除了国家有计划地培养各种科学技术人才外，在各工业部门必须特别注意合理使用现有技术力量，努力提高技术水平，并把他们很好地组织起来，以便更充分地发扬他们的技术特长；必须继续通过技术业余学校和技工学校等组织，并在生产的实际活动中，经常注意加强对工人们的技术教育。必须加强产品设计机构和基本建设设计机构，加强技术工作的管理制度，制订具体的技术组织措施计划，贯彻苏联专家的建议，推广先进经验，制定和改进技术标准，订立和贯彻技术操作规程和质量检验制度，加强科学研究工作，做好设备的维护和检修，有领导地改进和推行技术革新运动，并通过这些工作以提高我国现有的技术水平。
    国家要求我们一切工业企业部门不仅在数量上和质量上完成国家计划，而且必须在财务和成本方面完成国家计划。但无论生产企业或基本建设企业，目前对于财务成本管理的注意和领导还是不够的，浪费现象或多或少还是比较普遍的，有的甚至还是严重的。这是目前工业企业管理中最薄弱的一个环节。在若干生产企业中，原材料的消耗，人工和水、电、燃料的消耗定额都比较高，例如橡胶轮胎的生胶消耗量在同样规格的条件下，轻工业部所属橡胶一厂比二厂多消耗三公斤多。纺一件纱的用棉量在今年上半年有的地区平均高达二百点九一公斤，而另一地区只需一百九十三点二七公斤。这虽然和棉花质量、气候条件及计算方法等有关，但不能说和我们企业管理的缺点无关。另外企业的冗员过多。以一九五三年五个工业部计算，非生产人员年初占全体职工的百分之十五点二，第三季度增加到百分之十七点四，临时雇工尚不在内，今年的情况虽有某些改进，但进步是不大的，这样不仅妨碍了劳动生产率的提高，而且增加了企业的经费开支，加大了企业的成本。加以杂费开支也大，就使产品成本不能继续降低。据中央五个工业部一九五三年有成本计划的五百零三个企业统计，有一百五十二个企业未完成成本计划。其中中央重工业部一百一十五个企业的统计，有三十四个企业没有完成成本计划，在三十二种主要产品中，有二分之一没有完成成本计划；而在一九五四年上半年对八十一个企业的统计，未完成成本和利润计划的约在百分之二十至三十之间。其他各部的情况大体也是如此，有的甚至更坏。如果就若干企业完成成本计划的情况来分析，成本的降低主要还是依靠增加产量，而在原材料及管理费的节约方面做得较差。例如中央轻工业部所属利华造纸厂，今年第一季度胶板印刷纸的成本，虽比计划降低了百分之零点二七，但其原材料费用却比计划超过百分之五。而这并不是个别的例子。在若干基本建设企业中，材料的浪费和积压也是相当严重的。如燃料工业部所属三六○工程在今年四月至五月，不满两个月内，仅浪费水泥一项就有四百八十一吨。建筑用的机械和加工厂机械的利用率较低，检修保养较差，损坏较多，加以管理机构大，窝工时间多，就不能不加大了建筑成本。显然，这些情况，都是和我们国家的积累资金和合理的运用资金的方针相违背的。
    克服这一严重缺点的主要办法，就是要求各工业企业和建设单位必须教育所属人员普遍建立社会主义严格节约的思想和制度，坚决执行企业的财务计划和预决算制度，建立与健全对材料、人工、管理费的严格管理制度，特别要注意控制主要原材料的消耗定额、人工定额和杂费的开支，同时要建立对成本及时的正确的核算，要经常进行经济活动的分析，要积极推销成品，处理呆滞材料，以充分动员企业内部的资源，加速流动资金的周转，来达到改善财务成本工作与节约国家资金的目的。
    必须指出，上述问题和缺点的产生，在很大的程度上是和我们工业管理部门忽视思想政治领导和某些工业管理干部中的骄傲自满情绪分不开的，也是和我们工业领导机构中的某些官僚主义分不开的。因此，我们必须加强工业企业中的思想政治领导，克服任何骄傲自满情绪，克服一切官僚主义，坚决依靠工人阶级，善于总结工作经验，不怕困难，改正缺点，兢兢业业，勤勤恳恳，努力全面完成并超额完成今年的工业生产计划和基本建设计划，编好对五年计划有决定意义的一九五五年的年度计划，并在今年第四季度内做好明年的一切准备工作。我们必须尽快地进一步学会管理工业，把我们工业的计划水平，技术水平和管理水平真正地提高一步，为加速我国社会主义工业化而奋斗！
    沈雁冰代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我对于周恩来总理的政府工作报告和郭沫若主任关于文化教育工作的发言完全同意。现在，请允许我就文化艺术工作方面补充说明一点情况，并谈到其中一些主要的问题。
    电影事业是文化事业中的重点。全国现有四个国营制片厂，至一九五三年年底止，共摄制了各类影片二百五十二部（其中故事片四十九部），翻译了苏联及人民民主国家的优秀影片三百二十部（其中故事片一百五十九部）。全国现有电影院七百八十三座（一九四九年为五百九十六座），电影放映队二千二百五十四队。电影院的增设，首先以满足工矿区和城市的工人集中区为原则，同时也照顾到没有电影院的小城市。放映队的活动地区主要是工厂、矿山、基本建设工地和农村。
    戏剧也是一个重点。现在全国共有经过整编的国营剧团一百四十八个（其中话剧团四十二个），民间职业剧团二千一百个以上；剧场一千七百四十座（其中半数以上尚为私营）。为了适应群众的文化需要，中央文化部规定：所有国营剧团每年除须完成一定的剧场演出任务外，并须在工矿区巡回演出，两者的演出次数，都要订在计划内。一九五三年度各国营剧团基本上都完成了预定的演出任务。去年两次赴朝慰问演出及在全国各地工厂、矿山和农村的巡回演出，本年年初慰劳人民解放军的演出，都收到了很好的效果。
    在社会文化事业方面，发展极为迅速的是文化馆和文化站。现在全国共有文化馆二千四百四十二个，文化站四千四百一十三个。文化馆和文化站是文化工作的基层组织，在广大人民中间以多种多样的方式进行宣传教育工作。另外，全国现有公共图书馆九十五个，博物馆四十五个。
    以上是一些主要的文化工作机构的大概情况。除上述文化机构外，工农群众的业余文化艺术活动，几年来有很大的发展。据初步统计，全国职工业余文化艺术组织在一万个以上，农村业余剧团在十万个以上。
    在文学艺术的创作上，五年来也有不少的成就。但我们的工作，还远不能满足人民的日益增长的要求。不但在数量上不够，在工作的质量上也不能令人满意。各位代表，你们是从人民中间来的，你们带来了广大人民对于文化艺术工作的宝贵意见。作为一个文化工作者，现在我打算讲一讲文化工作的主要问题和我们在工作中所得的经验教训，请求你们指示。
    首先是提高文艺作品的质量的问题。
    文化各部门都是同广大人民天天接触，而且是要通过艺术形象对人民进行社会主义的思想教育的。文化工作的开展固然有赖于各种工作机构的建立，但是进行思想教育的效果如何，却决定于文艺作品的是否具有高度的思想性和艺术性。在这里，质量是头等重要的问题。有了几千个电影放映队，有了几百个剧团、歌舞团，而如果我们的影片、剧本、歌曲、舞蹈等等，思想性不高，那就一定不会达到思想教育的目的；但即使作品的思想性在一定水准以上而艺术性不够，那也不会获得广大人民的喜爱。群众看了那些徒有政治口号而缺乏艺术的血肉的作品，称之为“看宣传戏”，这是值得我们深切地反省的。我们的任务不是化妆演讲而是通过文艺的形式，给老百姓看一些有血有肉的活人，以及这些活人所做的叫人感动、叫人深思、叫人钦仰、叫人向他们学习的英勇事迹和模范工作。
    我们的创作上的缺点在于今天的作品还很少能够从社会发展的本质上，从各个社会现象的相互关系上，来描写我国在过渡时期中的新同旧的矛盾，进步同落后的斗争，阶级关系的变化和人的变化。
    我们的缺点也表现在我们的大多数作品缺乏旺盛的想像力，缺乏活泼多样的格调。
    我们的缺点又表现在我们有时对作品的政治性理解得太机械、太狭隘，动辄板起面孔说教，以至造成了脱离群众的现象。例如老百姓喜欢“胖娃娃”、“老鼠做亲”等一类的年画，而我们给他们的新年画，极大部分是“拖拉机来了”等等政治性虽强而画面却枯燥单调的东西，结果是“老鼠做亲”一类旧年画的销路仍然超过了我们的新年画。
    创作上之所以有这些缺点，原因当然很多，但主要应由文化主管部门负责。我们曾经有一个时期，错误地用行政方式去组织创作。我们也曾经常地陷于事务主义，而忽略了思想领导，乃至放弃了思想领导。电影“武训传”的反人民的本质，直到中央严正地指出以后，方始提起我们的警觉，这对于我们是一次很深刻的教育。
    在提高质量这一个问题上，我们还必须记住：我们的文化工作的远大目标是要创造民族形式的社会主义现实主义的文学、艺术；也就是，中国民族形式的社会主义文学艺术。正因为这是民族形式的，所以我们就必须继承并发扬我国文艺的优秀传统，“推陈出新”。而又因为我国是一个多民族的国家，所以继承并发扬民族文艺优秀传统的意义就不仅是继承并发扬汉族的、各地方的，而且也必须包括各兄弟民族的民族形式的优秀传统，真正做到“百花齐放”。这都是毛主席早就教导了我们的。这几年来，我们在这方面做了不少工作，也获得了一些成就；但我们的工作，是有缺点的。例如，错误地理解了“推陈”，把旧传统的精华也推掉了。例如不善于通过正确的加工和提高以达到“出新”，因而出来了非驴非马的东西。这种毛病，不但对于汉族的戏曲和民间音乐舞蹈加工时曾经有过，对于兄弟民族的音乐舞蹈加工时也是有过的。
    继承并发扬祖国文化遗产，创造民族形式的社会主义现实主义的文艺，是一个艰巨的长期的工作。我们几年来陆续建立了若干工作机构（例如中央文学研究所，中国戏曲研究院，民族美术研究所，民族音乐研究所，以及新成立的北京舞蹈学校），培养了一些干部，积累了若干经验。在这样的基础上，正确地执行毛主席的文艺方针，在中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，及时总结经验，接受教训，我们的工作是可以稳步前进的。
    文化工作中的第二个、但决不是次要的问题，就是在反对急躁冒进的同时，也必须反对保守思想。
    急躁冒进的倾向是有它的客观原因的。广大人民对于文化生活的需要是如此的迫切，我们的事业机构尽管年年在增加扩大，然而总是供不应求。为了适应这样迫切的需要，有计划地发展是必要的，但急躁冒进却是有害的。急躁冒进是只看见需要，而不估计主观力量，只一般地看问题而不分别轻重缓急。摊子愈摆愈多，愈多愈杂，天天要人，天天喊人不够，下边忙得要命，上边急得要命。结果是一大堆摊子，徒有门面，缺乏内容，甚至有不好的内容，浪费了人力物力且不说，而在宣传教育上所造成的不良影响，那损失是难以数目字来估计的。
     一九五三年后，在“整顿巩固，重点发展，提高质量，稳步前进”的工作方针之下，急躁冒进的倾向基本上是纠正了。但保守思想又有潜滋暗长的可能。
    保守思想的根源在于没有充分估计到发展的可能性，在于忽视了社会的潜在力量的深厚，也在于一般地看问题，只估计到各地文化发展的不平衡性，而没有从长久打算上有计划、有重点地对落后地区特加注意。
    保守思想表现在业务上的，就是墨守成规，不敢大胆吸收先进经验，作革新的努力。在艺术创造活动上，保守思想成为我们的艺术工作不够活泼、缺乏想像力和创造性的主要原因。优秀传统必须继承，但继承不是原封不动，而必须取其精华，去其糟粕，然后才能有发展。加强学习世界先进的文化艺术，特别是学习苏联的社会主义文化艺术的先进经验，是克服墨守成规的保守思想的必要条件。
    根据过去的经验教训，我以为在工作机构的建立和扩展方面，我们要反对的，主要是急躁冒进。而在业务的改进和提高方面，我们要反对的，主要是保守思想。我们必须这样地来进行两条战线的斗争，努力艺术的实践，逐步提高质量。只有这样，然后才能够贯彻毛主席的文艺方针，配合总路线的宣传，在思想教育工作上完成我们的任务。
    我热烈地希望各位代表对我们的工作多加指正。
    马寅初代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我们这几个月来讨论了中华人民共和国宪法草案，几天前又听到刘少奇委员关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告，这个报告分析事实和解答问题均很详尽透彻；两天前又听到周恩来总理的政府工作报告，叙述解放以来短短的五年中我国各方面建设的辉煌成就，和我国和平外交政策所取得的巨大胜利，极其准确明了。我以无限的欢欣和万分感谢的心情热烈拥护这两个报告。
    宪法的重点在于实践，但好多事情，政务院是早已实践了的。这个宪法，实实在在是一个胜利的记录和经验的总结，它用立法形式把人民革命的成果和中华人民共和国建立以来政治上、经济上的成就巩固起来，同时又指明了继续前进的道路。宪法第九十五条规定：“国家对于从事科学、教育、文学、艺术和其他文化事业的公民的创造性工作，给以鼓励和帮助。”这就是过去五年中政府对文教事业所做工作的总结，北京大学是一个好的例子。在过去五年中，国家对北京大学已经给了很大的鼓励、关怀和帮助。在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，今日新型的北京大学，远非蒋介石时代的北京大学可比了。让我在这里向诸位代表谈一谈北京大学的现状和解放以来各项工作发展的情况。
    （一）学校经费情况：
    一九四九年北京大学的经费是人民币三亿一千万元（小米折成）。一九五四年已达到人民币九百零二亿一千四百万元。计：一般经费五百零五亿九千五百万元。基本建设经费三百九十六亿一千九百万元。
    （二）校舍发展方面：
    我校三年以来发展很快。校舍方面，新建八万六千四百二十四平方米，其中教室实验室，及办公用房二万五千三百零八平方米，学生宿舍二万九千八百七十八平方米，教职员宿舍及住宅二万六千零三十五平方米，远远超过美帝国主义分子在中国办理的燕京大学三十多年建筑面积的总和。目前学生宿舍可容五千七百余人。
    （三）卫生室发展情况：
    一九四九年北京大学的校医室只有医生三人、护士四人以及简单的设备，仅仅为师生员工做些极简单的治疗，也没有病房、病床的设备。从一九五二年院系调整以后，为加强师生员工的校医保健工作，校医室改为卫生室，原来仅有内科，现已扩大分科，分设内科、外科、牙科及其他科。为加强保健工作，特设保健组及防痨组，防痨组设有X光室，外科设有手术室，各科设有病房，有病床六十张，并备有救护车一辆。我们也实行公费医疗制度，医务工作人员已增加到六十八人。
    （四）膳食发展情况：
    一九四九年全校只有三个食堂，仅能供给一千多人吃饭。现在全校有大小食堂十个，可以同时供七千人用饭；另有豆浆站一个，对身体不好的同学和教职员设有营养食堂；对兄弟民族，设有“清真东方红食堂”；对民主国家留学生，设有留学生食堂。伙食的质量也比一九四九年有显著的提高，学生每天每人可以吃到三、四两肉，教职员工食堂每天每人可以吃到六两肉。
    （五）对青年学生予以经济上照顾的情况：
    解放初期，为了照顾经济困难的青年学生继续求学，国家设立了人民助学金。当时一般学生，仍须自己交纳伙食费，经济困难的学生，除可请求补助伙食费外，尚可有一部零用费，但数目很小，对于缺少衣服被褥以及患病需要营养食品的学生照顾不够周到。目前的情况完全不同了。从一九五二年九月份起，随着国家经济情况的好转，所有在高等学校学习的青年学生，皆由国家供给伙食费，而且由于伙食费的增加，也提高了伙食的质量。此外，北京大学对于经济困难的学生，不论生活方面，学习方面，衣服被褥方面，以及患病学生的营养方面，皆予以更多的照顾。例如在天暖的时候，可以请求发单衣服；天冷的时候，可请求发棉衣服；没有被褥的可请求发被褥；患病的同学，除了另吃较好的伙食外，还可补助牛奶、鸡蛋等营养品；甚至于患近视眼的可请求配眼镜，牙齿缺少的可请求镶牙齿。由此可见我们的政府对于青年学生是多么关怀啊！
    以上是经费、校舍、卫生、膳食和对青年照顾的发展的情况。
    其次让我来谈一谈北京大学教学方面的发展。
    北京大学的任务是培养科学研究人才和高等学校的师资，设有十三个系，即：数学力学系、物理系、化学系、生物系、地质地理系、中国语言文学系、历史系、哲学系、经济系、法律系、俄语系、东方语言系和西方语言文学系；此外，还设有二个专修科，即：图书馆学专修科和外国留学生中国语文专修班。每系之下有一个或几个专业，共有三十五个专业，二个班（即波兰语文班、捷克语文班），七十九个教研室。今年第一学期设专门化课程十二个，第二学期设十八个。现有教师七百四十四人（刚解放时只有二百一十三人），学生五千二百三十六人（刚解放时只有一千八百二十四人），其中包括研究生二百八十九人，外国留学生一百四十人，进修教师一百零六人，而二百八十九名研究生之中跟随苏联专家学习的约二百人。北大聘有苏联专家十三人，其中七人已到校，六人今年可来，专家对我校工作帮助最大的是培养研究生。这些研究生在专家的教导下，都能专心学习，成绩一般很好，这与专家的无私的帮助和忘我的劳动是分不开的。北京大学还设有工农速成中学，吸收工农革命干部和产业工人入学。此外，图书已由解放时的一百万册增至一百七十万册，实验室已由二十个增至六十九个。今年第一学期开课三百七十门，共五百零九班，体育十三门，共八十班。
    北京大学在教学制度、教学内容和教学方法方面，也进行了重大的改革：
    （一）在教学制度上：旧北京大学在教学上的盲目性已不复存在，旧时代“通才教育”的设置办法也早被废除。目前北京大学三十五个专业都制订了有高度系统性的教学计划，大部分课程都制订了与教学计划紧密结合的教学大纲，并编写了许多适合国家建设需要的新教材，使教学计划有目的、有计划地进行。
    （二）在教学内容上：我们重视科学性和思想性，力求内容丰富而准确。既努力整理和传授伟大祖国的文化遗产，也努力学习苏联的先进文化科学，对世界各国的进步文化科学也注意吸收，但必须结合实际，以适应祖国伟大社会主义建设的需要。教师们对科学研究都非常重视，经常以每天半个工作日的时间进行研究工作。现在正从事研究的专题，在社会科学方面有八十一题；在自然科学方面有五十五题；在语言文学方面有二十七题，共有一百六十三个专题，这些专题都将有助于祖国科学文化水平的提高。教师们在从事科学研究中，提倡学术思想自由；在科学讨论时，各种不同见解都可以展开论争，只要是真理都被教师们所接受，并以之充实教学内容。
    （三）在教学方法上：我们注意理论联系实际，积极培养学生的独立思考和独立工作的能力，因而学生学习成绩都不断进步，近一年半以来，获得优等成绩的学生增加了百分之十八点一，目前北京大学正以最大的努力来实现国家所给予的培养优秀干部的任务。
    以上是一九五二年院系调整以来北京大学改革工作的一般情况。但是我们的工作还做得不够好：（一）学校领导上，尤其是系的领导上，存在着好多缺点；（二）苏联专家的能力，还没有使之尽量发挥；（三）科学研究刚刚开始，还不能说有很显著的成就可以贡献，因此我们还赶不上国家实际需要；（四）学校与科学院以及各业务部门还没有紧密地联系起来。我在此趁便提出一点意见请政府考虑：
    目前各部门内部的工作日益计划化，但彼此相互之间的关联尚不够密切，请拿科学院和北京大学为例。苏联科学研究能够获得今天的成就，原因之一就是苏联科学院同莫斯科大学有密切的合作。因此我以十二万分的诚意欢迎科学院同我们合作。两方面合作，收效必宏；同时我们两方面也必须同业务机关密切联系，深切了解业务机关所需要研究的问题，使我们两方面的科学研究同国家的需要紧密地结合起来，以避免各自为政盲目进行的危险。至于如何合作，请政府速定办法。
    最后我提出一个建议，北京大学的红楼和民主广场是值得骄傲的。红楼是一九一九年北京青年学生反对帝国主义、封建统治的司令部；民主广场是北京青年学生反对蒋介石卖国贼和美帝国主义的策源地。在红楼里面，有毛主席工作室，革命先烈李大钊先生的纪念室和鲁迅先生的教室。自一九五二年北京大学搬到郊外之后，不能把红楼和民主广场一同搬走。红楼自建筑以来近四十年，年久失修，希望政府照原样子重新修建，改名为革命博物馆或毛泽东博物馆均可。把毛主席工作室和李大钊先生的纪念室照原样子保存下来，以供后世的瞻仰。我想我的建议，在座的诸位代表谅必都会赞成的。
    陈垣代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我能够参加全国人民代表大会第一次会议，感到非常兴奋和光荣。会议庄严地通过了我们国家的根本大法——中华人民共和国宪法和几个重要的法律。这个宪法，是中国人民建设社会主义社会的有力武器。我衷心拥护，并保证坚决遵守宪法，按照宪法办事。
    会议上听到了周总理的政府工作报告，我对于这个全面的符合实际情况的报告，表示完全同意和拥护。
    解放后的五年，是我们中国有史以来起了根本变化的五年，我们国际地位空前提高，人民民主政权日益巩固，工业生产迅速发展，农业产品逐年增加，交通运输能力不断提高，国内外贸易继续在扩大，文化教育、医药卫生、科学艺术都有了很大的发展。我们劳动人民创造着奇迹，五年来作着排山倒海、翻天覆地的事业，使得我们的国家面貌日新月异，在各个建设战线上，都有了飞跃的进步，取得了伟大的成就。所有这一切，完全是由于中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导，由于中央人民政府的正确领导得来的。党和政府种种贤明的措施，是数也数不完的，我满怀热诚地对此表示无限的感谢。
    同全国各方面建设一样，我们高等师范教育，也有了显著的发展和提高。旧中国的统治者对高等师范教育一向不重视，高等师范学校不但数量少，而且系统紊乱，课程庞杂，教学内容是陈旧的，教学方法是脱离实际的。解放以来，我们高等师范教育在整个国家建设中，有着非常重要的地位，党和政府十分重视。我们进行了一系列的改革，确定了高等师范教育新的教育体系，高等师范学校全部独立设置，不但学校数量、学生人数逐年增加，而且我们在整顿巩固、重点发展、提高质量、稳步前进的方针指导下，在学习苏联先进经验与中国实际相结合的原则下，进行了教学改革，并由此逐步提高了教学质量。我们的教师，经过了伟大的思想改造运动，建立起专业思想。广大的教职员得到政府在政治上、物质上和精神上的关怀。我们逐渐作到“人尽其才”，“学以致用”，能真正发挥出自己的专长和潜在力量，改变了过去“学非所用”的情况。同学们也逐渐认识到人民教师在祖国建设中所占地位的重要，贯彻毛主席“三好”的指示，自觉地要把自己培养成为“德才兼备、体魄健全”的全面发展的人才。
    我们北京师范大学就是全国将近四十所高等师范学校中的一个。五年以来，我们在不断地改进和发展。在苏联专家热心帮助和指导之下，我们制订了全部教学计划，教师们都积极地钻研教学大纲和教材，认真地备课和编写讲稿，负责地进行课堂教学，耐心地进行课外辅导。教学质量在不断提高。许多教师出色地完成了教学任务。教学经费和仪器设备在逐渐增加。新校舍已开始建筑。根据国家建设的需要，我们学校的规模逐步扩大，我们的学生、研究生的数量也在显著增加。所以如此，就是因为高等师范教育是我们整个教育事业的重要一环。高等师范学校的数量和质量，直接影响建设社会主义社会的青年一代，间接影响国家培养建设工作干部的计划和国家建设计划的完成。所以我们高等师范学校培养出的人民教师，数量要多，才能源源不断地供应全国的师资；质量要好，才能更有成效地服务于社会主义教育建设的事业。
    要达到这样的目的，当然首先应当严格地要求我们自己。我们高等师范教育工作者的缺点还很多。今后我们要在政府领导和人民监督之下，加倍努力，把我们的工作做好，不断培养出大批优秀的合格的人民教师，以不辜负国家对我们的信任和委托。但另一方面，由于旧社会遗留下来的长期影响，有些人对于高等师范教育，对于作人民教师的工作，还有种种不正确的看法，这些看法，不但在一定程度上影响到现在的教师的专业思想，而且也影响到一部分青年对投考师范学校抱着踌躇不前的态度。这同祖国建设的要求是不一致的。当然这种现象已在逐渐改变，而且我们确信一定会逐步扭转并肃清。几年来，我们看到人民教师已得到社会的重视，投考高等师范学校的青年已经逐年增加，我们北京师范大学的新生，把投考师范学校当作第一志愿的比率一年比一年上升，就是很好的例证。但是，我们还希望全国人民和社会舆论大力支援，使我们高等师范教育得到更迅速的发展，使我们国家整个的建设计划能够胜利完成。
    最后，我完全拥护周总理所说：台湾是中国神圣不可侵犯的领土，决不容许美国侵占。我们中国人民一定要解放台湾，解放台湾是我国六万万人民的不可动摇的共同意志。我们一定要把蒋介石卖国集团坚决、彻底、干净全部消灭，同台湾人民一起来建设我们伟大的社会主义国家。
    高方启代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意周恩来总理代表中央人民政府所作的政府工作报告，并表示衷心的拥护！
    中华人民共和国成立五年来，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的正确领导下，在苏联巨大无私的帮助下，在全国人民的辛勤努力下，我国在政治、经济、文化等各方面都取得了伟大的成就，国际地位也得到了空前的提高，其中经济恢复和经济建设工作有了显著的成就。就以我工作的工厂为例，一九五三年比一九五○年在产品数量上提高了五倍，劳动生产率增长了百分之一百一十五，产品成本也降低了百分之三十六，流动资金一九五三年比一九五一年缩短周转期百分之八点一八；同时，产品质量也在逐年提高，一九五三年比一九五○年提高了百分之十六点五。几年来我们已初步掌握了一部分先进的科学技术，每年都按期完成了生产任务和基本建设计划，职工的劳动条件及文化物质生活也随着生产的提高得到了改善。
    在国家的社会主义工业化的正确方针下，我同其他很多干部一样，被党和国家派到国营工厂担任行政领导工作。几年来，我抱着献身于祖国的社会主义工业化的决心，响应“由外行变内行”的号召，边作边学。虽然初步学到了一些组织近代化企业生产的知识，但距离掌握近代化企业的生产技术的要求还差得很远，因而在管理企业生产工作中存在的缺点也是很多的。最主要的缺点是向苏联专家学习不够。由于我存在着保守思想，还没有真正老老实实地学习，这主要是我没有全面系统地认识到苏联先进经验的优越性，因此，也就不可能有力地组织各级干部和职工认真学习。苏联先进经验是科学技术的结晶，在我们原有基础的条件下进行学习，自然是需要更大的努力；但是由于我们缺乏刻苦钻研的精神而没有学到深处。过去我们曾不适当地强调本身的特殊情况，用了迁就落后的办法去学习苏联先进经验，这就降低了苏联先进经验的作用及其完整性。实际上我们只有不懂不会的情况，这就更要求我们全面系统地成套地学习苏联先进经验，才是正确的作法，才能管理好企业。过去在学习苏联先进技术上做了一些工作，也获得了一定成就，但忽视了学习苏联先进管理经验，没有按照苏联企业管理原则建立和健全一长制、生产区域管理制和严格的责任制。这在实际上把企业的完整的管理破坏了，也必然障碍技术的提高，因而形成全厂的生产技术及管理水平不高的局面。这就是计划不准确、生产不均衡、技术管理不健全、质量不稳定、浪费较严重的原因。总之，在近代化企业里，如果是全面系统地成套地学习苏联先进经验，就能迅速提高生产技术和管理水平，反之就会走弯路，这就是我最深刻的体会。
    今后我一定加强学习，提高自己的觉悟，钻研业务，钻研技术，坚决克服上述缺点。一定努力学习苏联先进经验，老老实实，勤勤恳恳，力戒任何的虚夸和骄傲。我们有充分的信心，克服一切困难更好地完成国家计划，同全国人民一道，为解放台湾和加速实现祖国的社会主义工业化的伟大事业而积极努力！
    侯德榜代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我忠诚地拥护周总理的政府工作报告。
    毛主席在这次开会时指示我们：“我国人民应当努力工作，努力学习苏联和各兄弟国家的先进经验，老老实实，勤勤恳恳，互勉互助，力戒任何的虚夸和骄傲，准备在几个五年计划之内，将我们现在这样一个经济上文化上落后的国家，建设成为一个工业化的具有高度现代文化程度的伟大的国家。”毛主席这个指示真是时时刻刻永远不可忘记的。尤其是我们工程师们听了周总理的报告后，觉得有更大的责任，更要努力把我们工业落后的国家，建成社会主义工业化的国家，有高度科学技术、现代文化的伟大国家。
    我是一个受过美帝国主义教育最深的一个人，也是一个受过英美资本主义教育毒害最厉害的人。在抗战初期，我经常往来英美和希特勒的德国之间，从事化工设计。我记得解放初期我尚以为英美的科学、工程、技术并不坏。学习了苏联以来，我有一个认识。我发觉苏联科学进步之快，远超过英美，而苏联教科书和专门技术书籍较英美书本更丰富，更切合实用，而取价更廉，更切切实实地使科学技术为人民服务。这给了我很大的教育。使我深刻地认识苏联，坚决地学习苏联。
    听了周总理的报告，给我们很大的鼓舞。作为一个科学工作者，我更要坚决学习苏联政治理论，更要学习马克思列宁主义，以期能够运用马克思列宁主义辩证唯物论的武器，来攻习科学，钻研科学，批判英美资本主义科学中的唯心学说。
    作为一个化学工业的工程师，我深深体会我们的工业应当更多地帮助农业。为了满足社会主义工业建设的需要，也希望农民增加生产，支援工业。农民增加生产最需要的是化学肥料。我建议我们国家在建设中，相应地增设化学肥料工厂，如氮气肥料工厂、磷酸肥料工厂等等。为了加强工农联盟，我们不单必须大量生产化学肥料，供给农民，并且必须大大减低制造成本，提高技术效能，廉价售给农民，使农民能够普遍地使用。这些化学肥料工业，不单是重工业的一部分，而且是加强我国国防、供应国防需要的一种军需原料工业。
    科学家们！我国科学工作还没有充分地和实际结合。也就是说，我们科学研究符合经济建设和国防建设的要求还不够。我们科学工作应当环绕着国家建设需要来进行。我们中国科学家更要向苏联的科学家学习。苏联科学家以最短时间，在三、五年中，完成原子能的研究，并且进而应用原子能来征服大自然。例如移山、挖洞、改变气候、绿化沙漠等等；更进而用原子能建立发电所，为世界上成立了原子能动力厂的头一个国家。美国统治集团妄想独占原子武器，阴谋控制全世界。到了听见苏联也有原子武器，美帝国主义好战分子气焰始稍减杀。这证明了美帝国主义是像一个强盗，借有凶器，摇幌威胁。一旦遇有能够武装自卫的人，则不敢轻举妄动。我们科学工作者有了中国共产党和毛主席英明的领导，有了苏联科学家无私的帮助，我相信我国科学工作者可以迅速完成各种高度基本科学的研究，包括原子能研究。
    周总理报告了外交政策。我们国家成立以来，即和伟大的苏联结成牢不可破的友谊，壮大了社会主义和平民主力量。我国和朝鲜有史以来就是唇齿相依。在反对美帝国主义侵略战争中，我们和朝鲜人民更用鲜血凝成不可分离的战斗友谊。对于越南人民反对侵略和争取民族解放的英勇战争，我国人民是完全同情的。不久以前，在日内瓦会议上，对和平解决印度支那问题，我们同苏联和越南民主共和国的代表一起粉碎了美帝国主义破坏印度支那和平的阴谋，取得了伟大的胜利。我国又和苏联及新民主主义国家先后签订了经济和文化合作协定，更加强了国际友好关系。此次周总理到印度、缅甸两国访问，更进一步巩固了亚洲国家间的友谊。根据周总理提出的五项外交原则精神，树立了国际和平友好的基础；证明了不同社会制度的国家可以和平共处；肯定了任何国际争端都可以用协商方式获得和平解决，从而缓和了国际紧张局势。
    为了保卫祖国建设和祖国安全，为了保卫亚洲及世界和平，我们一定要解放台湾。只有解放台湾，才能完成祖国人民的解放事业。蒋介石匪帮被赶出祖国大陆，逃到台湾，凭借美国海军空军，盘踞台湾。这种勾结外国武力背叛祖国的卖国贼，决不能容许他逍遥法外，不予惩罚。台湾是中国不可分割的领土。我们要坚决解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，祛除美帝国主义侵略威胁，收复我们祖国神圣的一部分领土。
    所以我完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告，并建议会议通过。让我们坚决地尽我们每个人所有力量为建设社会主义的新中国而奋斗。
    马明方代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全赞成和拥护周总理的政府工作报告。
    我们的国家，五年来在各项工作上业已取得许多辉煌的成就。这些成就给我们为继续争取社会主义建设事业的胜利创造了极为重要的条件。这是值得我们每个人欢欣鼓舞的。
    西北地区和全国一样。五年来在政治、经济和文化建设方面的成就也是极为显著的。各族人民间的友谊、团结，人民对于共产党、人民政府和毛主席的衷心信赖，已经成为一种强大的社会力量和物质力量，而且在不断地发展和增长中。但这并不是说我们的一切都是美好的、一帆风顺的。我们在胜利前进的途程中还存在着不少的缺点和过失。我们对于同广大群众的紧密联系，多方面地倾听群众的意见，负责干部同一般工作人员间的互相结合、互相监督和批评，都还做得很不够，都还需要我们继续加以改进，以便更好地发扬每个干部的工作积极性，增进工作效果，提高广大群众的政治觉悟和生产热忱。我们在各项建设事业中，例如在工程建筑中的某些返工浪费和工程质量的不合标准，厂矿生产中的产品质量、工资制度、财务管理的改进还很不够，物资保管中也常常因为某些过失而造成浪费和损坏，修建事业中也修建了一些现在不很急需的建筑物。如像有些大礼堂和休养所的修建就有失之过早的现象。这些缺点和过失虽然是局部的、个别的，并且在不断改进中，但仍然是值得我们从上到下经常注意检查、批判和克服的。因为我们只有不断地克服了这些缺点和过失，才能够更健全地、胜利地做好我们的一切工作。
    随着我们各项建设事业的胜利和发展，爱祖国，爱劳动业已逐渐成为我国人民的一种新的社会道德和社会风气。劳动是光荣的，不再如历史上有些人所说的那样是可耻的了。但这并不是所有的人都是这样想和这样做的。在我们的某些干部和工作人员中还存在和滋长着一种与此相反的贪图个人享受、对自己的工作和事业采取不负责的态度，并且常常因此而造成工作中或大或小的损失。我们对于这些不负责任的工作人员，除了经常对他们进行教育以外，是应该给以必要的纪律处分的。不能设想没有严格的工作纪律就可以把事情办好。这种不负责任的现象，是旧社会遗留下来的，是多少年来形成的一种剥削阶级的生活习惯和思想形态，因而需要我们花费很多时间和精力才能从根本上加以消除。旧生活习惯和旧思想形态的被消除，就是勤劳的、热爱人民事业和祖国财富的新的生活习惯、新的思想形态和社会道德的胜利。而这种新的生活习惯、思想形态和社会道德是我们在长远的历史前进途程中取得各项胜利的重要保证。
    我们不怕暴露自己的一切缺点和过失，我们也一定能够更加勇于改正和克服自己的一切缺点和过失，而把伟大的人民事业不断地引向新的更大的胜利。
