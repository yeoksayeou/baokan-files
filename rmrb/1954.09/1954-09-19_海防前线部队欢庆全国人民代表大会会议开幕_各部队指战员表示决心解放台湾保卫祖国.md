    The news of the victorious opening of the First Session of the First National People's Congress reached the frontline coastal defense troops, and commanders and fighters of various units were overjoyed and inspired, expressing their determination to celebrate the opening of the session with new combat victories and academic achievements.
    On the Fujian front, the soldiers of the Second Company of a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit, which had shot down or damaged nine Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes, moved their radios to the front line on the day of the opening of the congress to listen to the live broadcast of the session. The soldiers said one after another that they must shoot down more Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes. Liu Desan, a combat model of a certain unit, excitedly said: "This is a great happy event in the history of our people. I will resolutely follow the will of the people and fight to the end to liberate Taiwan!" Ji Ruixuan, the commander who led a certain naval reconnaissance unit to successfully attack the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops on Jinmen Island on August 23, said: "The opening of the National People's Congress session has realized the long-cherished wishes of the people of the whole country, but the people of Taiwan are still suffering under the oppression of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. We must strive for victory in every battle and resolutely liberate Taiwan so that our compatriots in Taiwan can return to the big family of the motherland and live a happy life as well." Cai Lin, the commander of a certain coastal artillery unit who has repeatedly performed meritorious service, said: "I will definitely lead the troops to prepare for combat, strengthen military and political studies, and celebrate the opening of the session with practical actions." Zhang Muren, a soldier who has been awarded the Second Class Merit, held his gun tightly in one hand and pointed to the rolling waves of the sea in front of him with the other, saying: "We must continue to heighten our vigilance, be ready at all times to eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops, and strive to defend the socialist construction of the motherland and defend the fruits of the people's victory."
    The sailors on the hero boat of the Toutoumen naval battle of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army Navy held a forum on the deck after listening to the live broadcast of the opening of the National People's Congress session. Du Jiaqi, the deputy captain, said that our captain, Wang Weifu, was elected as a representative to the National People's Congress and also attended this great meeting. This is the glory of all the members of our boat. We must work harder to study and fight, and resolutely fight for the liberation of Taiwan. Engineer Tan Jinliang and sailor Guo Tianyou said: Because of this great victory, we must be more vigilant, prevent the enemy's sabotage plots, and defend the safety of our great motherland.
