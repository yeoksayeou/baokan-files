[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, after the radio broadcast the news that the National People's Congress had unanimously passed the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, the people of the capital erupted. Factories, construction sites, government offices, shops, schools, and rural areas all held celebrations and symposiums to celebrate the passage of our country's constitution.

    Tiananmen Square became the center of people's celebrations. More than 30,000 workers, cadres, students, and citizens gathered here. Workers from the Jingxi Mining Bureau also came to participate. In the evening, Tiananmen Square was brightly lit, with spotlights illuminating it as if it were daytime, and colorful flags of all kinds fluttered in the wind. People sang and danced wildly here. Students, workers, and soldiers defending the motherland formed a large dance circle to the melody of accordions, dancing carnival dances, highland dances, Mongolian dances…

    More than 4,000 construction workers from the Beijing Hotel construction site, the People's Heroes Monument construction site, the Baotou Steel Second Construction Engineering Company, and other units, who were enjoying a Pingju opera at the Zhongshan Park Concert Hall, immediately applauded and cheered upon hearing the news of the passage of the constitution, and sang "The East is Red" to the accompaniment of the theater troupe's orchestra. Stone worker Ma Yukao from the People's Heroes Monument construction site said:
  “The constitution passed by the National People's Congress is the first constitution of the Chinese people. It fully meets the interests of our working class. It is the fruit of victory won by the people of our country under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and it was exchanged for the blood and sacrifice of millions of heroes and martyrs. We must build the People's Heroes Monument well, so that the monument, like the spirit of the martyrs, will be immortal.” Carpenter Liu Yongjie from the Beijing Hotel construction site said: "I am very happy that the constitution has been passed. Especially when I think that many representatives are living in the building we built with our own hands, I feel particularly happy. The timely completion of the Beijing Hotel is our practical manifestation of supporting the constitution. Now, we have accepted new tasks, and we must actively work hard to complete the construction tasks on time or ahead of schedule!"

    When the good news of the formal adoption of the constitution reached the Zhang Guozhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative, the members expressed their determination to support and celebrate the passage of the constitution with practical actions. Tong Qitai, the production team leader, said: "This is a great happy event. I will do a good job in the team and ensure that the three autumn harvests are done well. Not a single grain of food will be lost. I will increase the planting by 50 mu on the basis of the originally planned 600 mu as a gift to celebrate the birth of the constitution." Guo Rong, the director of the cooperative, said: "I have been looking forward to this good news for a long time. The development of cooperatives is also written in the constitution and protected by law. We guarantee that the cooperative will be as united as one person, and we will do a good job in expanding the cooperative, ensuring that every grain of food returns home this autumn, not losing a single grain, and expanding the wheat fields to celebrate the passage of the constitution."

    The students of universities and middle schools had been looking forward to this good news for a long time. After hearing the broadcast last night, they were all indescribably happy. More than 6,000 students from Renmin University of China paraded to celebrate in the western suburbs and in the city. Zhu Guohua, a national labor model studying at the school, said with emotion: "I am a worker, and now I have entered university; after the constitution is promulgated, more workers will go to university. I wholeheartedly support the constitution and will implement it with practical actions of hard study." When the parade of female students from the 12th and 25th middle schools passed the Beijing Hotel on East Chang'an Street, thinking that this was where the representatives of the National People's Congress lived, they could not help but sing "The East is Red" loudly. The representatives living upstairs immediately opened their windows and applauded the parading students warmly. The students from the Central Institute for Nationalities Attached Middle School went to Tiananmen Square in their colorful national costumes to celebrate. Ma Yuhuai, director of the political training class for ethnic minorities and a representative to the National People's Congress, rushed to the training class after the meeting to convey to the students the situation of the passage of the constitution at the conference. The students were so happy that they danced. Many school students held celebrations on campus. More than 1,000 students from the Affiliated Middle School of Beijing Normal University held a grand bonfire party on the playground; more than 3,000 students from Beijing Railway Institute lit torches and happily held a dance party.

    Yesterday, the first department store of Beijing Department Store Company broadcast the great news in all its stores. Salespersons and customers listened quietly to every article of the constitution. In the second department store, Zhang Chunpu and Geng Guiru, salespersons in the cosmetics section, were writing a letter of challenge from their group to the knitting group. After hearing the broadcast, they immediately wrote on the letter of challenge: "We are willing to work with you to complete the national plan and realize a socialist society as soon as possible." Many salespersons said that they must use the practical action of expanding sales to celebrate the passage of the constitution.

    Workers and shop assistants in private factories and shops throughout the city, with incomparable excitement, cheered the passage of the first people's constitution. After hearing the live broadcast of the National People's Congress passing the constitution, the shop assistants of Ruifuxiang Silk and Cloth Store and Yongxing Yang Paper Store immediately held a discussion. Wang Jun from Ruifuxiang Silk and Cloth Store said: "Such a constitution is the pride of our people. I will express my happiness with practical actions, assist the capitalists in improving management, and smoothly accept socialist transformation." Song Zhicheng from Yongxing Yang Paper Store said: "I must abide by the constitution, and I must also publicize it to the people around me so that everyone can abide by the constitution, because this constitution was formulated by us personally, and everyone has put forward opinions, and it expresses the wishes of our people."

    Residents of various district streets also generally listened to the broadcast. After listening to the broadcast, the masses in the jurisdiction of the Piku Hutong Police Station in Xidan District spontaneously organized themselves, beating gongs and drums in the jurisdiction. A burst of firecrackers sounded in the jurisdiction of the Zongmao Santiao Police Station in Xidan District last night. The parade of the masses was quickly formed.

    The parading crowds headed for Tiananmen Square by agreement. It was on this sacred square that the people of the capital and the people of the whole country celebrated the birth of New China five years ago. Every year on "May Day" and "National Day", it turns into a sea of ​​joy. Today - on this great festival, the square is once again submerged in bright red flags and singing and dancing crowds.

    首都人民热烈欢呼宪法的通过
    【本报讯】　昨天下午，广播电台传出了全国人民代表大会会议一致通过中华人民共和国宪法的消息后，首都人民沸腾起来了，工厂、工地、机关、商店、学校、农村纷纷举行庆祝会、座谈会，欢庆我国宪法的通过。
    天安门成了人们庆祝活动的中心。这里聚集了工人、干部、学生和市民三万多人。京西矿务局的工人们也赶来参加。晚上，天安门广场灯火辉煌，聚光灯把这里照得如同白昼，各种颜色的彩旗迎风飘扬。人们在这里狂歌欢舞。学生们、工人们、保卫祖国的战士们随着手风琴的旋律结成了一个大舞圈，跳着狂欢舞、高山舞、蒙古舞……
    正在中山公园音乐堂里欣赏评剧的北京饭店工地、人民英雄纪念碑工地、包钢第二建筑工程公司等单位的四千多名建筑工人，听到通过宪法的消息，立刻鼓掌欢呼，在剧团的乐队伴奏下，高唱“东方红”。人民英雄纪念碑工地石工马玉考说：
  “全国人民代表大会会议所通过的宪法是中国人民的第一个宪法。它完全符合我们工人阶级的利益。它是我国人民在党和毛主席领导下所得到的胜利果实，是千百万英雄烈士流血牺牲换取来的。我们一定要把人民英雄纪念碑修得好好的，让纪念碑像烈士们的精神一样，永垂不朽。”北京饭店工地的木工刘永杰说：“宪法通过了，我心里非常高兴。特别是当我想起许多代表们就住在我们亲手建成的大楼里的时候，心里格外有说不出的高兴。北京饭店大楼的及时完工，就是我们拥护宪法的实际表现。现在，我们又接受了新任务，我们一定要积极努力，争取按时或提前完成建设任务！”
    当正式通过宪法的喜讯传到张郭庄农业生产合作社的时候，社员们纷纷表示要以实际行动来拥护和庆祝宪法的通过。生产大队长佟起太说：“这是件大喜事，我要搞好队内工作，保证做好三秋工作，不丢掉一粒粮食，在原订播种六百亩的基础上增播五十亩，作为庆祝宪法诞生的献礼。”社主任郭荣说：“我早就盼望着今天这个好消息了。关于合作社的发展，也写在宪法上，受法律的保护。我们保证使合作社团结得像一个人一样，并且做好扩大社的工作，保证今秋颗粒还家，不丢一粒粮食，还要扩大麦田，来庆贺宪法的通过。”
    大学和中学的同学们早就盼望着这个喜讯，昨晚听到广播后，都有说不出的高兴。中国人民大学六千多名学生分别在西郊和城内游行庆祝。在该校上学的全国劳动模范朱国华感动地说：“我是一个工人，现在进了大学；宪法公布后，将会有更多的工人上大学。我衷心地拥护宪法，并且要以努力学习的实际行动来执行宪法。”女十二中和二十五中的游行队伍经过东长安街北京饭店时，想到这是全国人民代表大会代表们居住的地方，不禁高声唱起
  “东方红”来。住在楼上的代表们听到歌声，立刻打开窗户，向游行的同学热烈地鼓掌致意。中央民族学院附中的同学们穿着鲜艳的民族服装到天安门去庆祝。少数民族政治训练班主任马玉槐是全国人民代表大会代表，他开完大会后赶到训练班来，向同学们传达大会通过宪法的情况，同学们高兴得跳起舞来。很多学校的同学在校内举行了庆祝会。师大附中一千多名同学在操场上开了盛大的营火晚会；北京铁道学院三千多名同学点起火把欢乐地举行跳舞晚会。
    北京市百货公司第一门市部各个商场昨天都广播了这大喜的消息，售货员和顾客们，都静静地听着宪法的每一条文。在第二商场门市部，化装组营业员张春圃和耿桂如正在写全组向针织组的应战书，听到广播后马上又在应战书上写道：“愿和你们共同完成国家计划，早日实现社会主义社会。”很多售货员纷纷表示，一定要用扩大营业额的实际行动，来庆祝宪法的通过。
    全市私营工厂、商店的工人、店员们，以无比兴奋的心情，欢呼第一部人民宪法的通过。瑞蚨祥绸布店和永兴洋纸行的店员听到大会通过宪法实况录音广播后，马上举行了座谈会。瑞蚨祥绸布店王俊说：“这样的宪法是我们人民的骄傲。我要用实际行动来表达自己的高兴，协助资方改善经营，顺利地接受社会主义改造。”永兴洋纸行宋志城说：“我一定要遵守宪法，还要向周围的人进行宣传，让大家遵守宪法，因为这部宪法是我们亲手制订的，大家都提了意见，它表达了我们人民的心愿。”
    各区街道居民也普遍收听了广播。西单区皮库胡同派出所管界群众在收听广播后自动组织起来，敲打着锣鼓，在管界内进行。西单区宗帽三条派出所管界内昨天晚上响起了一片爆竹声。群众的游行队伍也很快地组成了。
    游行的队伍不约而同地走向天安门广场。就在这个神圣的广场上，五年前首都人民和全国人民一起欢呼过新中国的诞生，每年“五一”、“十一”，这里就变成欢乐的海洋。今天——在这伟大的节日里，广场又一次被鲜艳的红旗和载歌载舞的人群淹没了。
