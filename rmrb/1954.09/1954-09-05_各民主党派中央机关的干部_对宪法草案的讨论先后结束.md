The discussions on the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China by cadres of the central organs of the democratic parties—Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, China Democratic League, China Democratic National Construction Association, China Association for Promoting Democracy, Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, China Zhi Gong Party, and the Jiusan Society—concluded successively in late August and early September. Some cadres of the central organs of the democratic parties conducted discussions together with cadres of their respective Beijing municipal organs. Before the discussions, cadres of all units thoroughly read the Draft Constitution and listened to reports on it. Some units, such as the China Democratic National Construction Association, also compiled and printed reference materials on the Draft Constitution to assist cadres in their study. After careful study, all organs conducted chapter-by-chapter and article-by-article discussions.

During the discussions, cadres of all units showed great enthusiasm, considering it a very glorious and solemn task. They actively participated in the meetings and conscientiously put forward opinions for revision and supplementation. During the discussions, many off-duty members of the central organs and Beijing municipal branches of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang braved heavy rain to come from afar to participate. Cadres of the central organs and Beijing municipal organs of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and other organizations held discussions more than ten times. Cadres of the central organs of the China Zhi Gong Party held a total of twenty discussions. All units fully promoted democracy during the discussions. Some units also engaged in heated debates. Cadres of the central organs and Beijing municipal branches of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang also freely combined after the meetings to widely exchange opinions on the Draft Constitution. According to statistics from the central organs and Beijing municipal organs of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and the Jiusan Society, a total of 983 revisions, supplementary opinions, and questions were raised during the discussions.

Through the discussions on the Draft Constitution, cadres of the organs of the democratic parties gained a comparatively further understanding of the basic spirit and main content of the Draft Constitution. During the discussions, they criticized the reactionary theories of the bourgeoisie on the constitutional issue, exposed the hypocrisy and reactionary nature of capitalist constitutions; and, based on their personal experiences since liberation, further recognized the superiority of our people's democratic system and recognized the concrete path for the broad masses of the people of our country to build socialism under the leadership of the working class. Some cadres recalled the undemocratic and unfree conditions in the old society and the persecution suffered overseas under imperialism. From the contrast between the past and the present, they deeply felt that the Draft Constitution was full of democratic spirit. Some cadres said with emotion: Only in a people's democratic country under the leadership of the working class can the democratic rights of the people be truly guaranteed. During the discussions, everyone also gained a further understanding of the nature and tasks of the people's democratic united front during the transition period, believing that our country's people's democratic united front will continue to play its role in the future in completing the state's general task during the transition period and in the struggle against enemies at home and abroad. Everyone expressed that after the promulgation of the Constitution, they would earnestly abide by and implement it, unite and lead the masses they are connected with under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, strengthen socialist ideological remoulding, and do their work better.

    各民主党派中央机关的干部
    对宪法草案的讨论先后结束
   【新华社四日讯】中国国民党革命委员会、中国民主同盟、中国民主建国会、中国民主促进会、中国农工民主党、中国致公党、九三学社等民主党派中央机关的干部，对中华人民共和国宪法草案的讨论已在八月底九月初先后结束。有些民主党派中央机关的干部是和所属北京市机关的干部在一起进行讨论的。各单位的干部在讨论以前，深入地阅读了宪法草案，听了有关宪法草案的报告。中国民主建国会等单位为帮助干部进行研究，还编印了宪法草案参考资料。经过认真学习以后，各机关都进行了逐章逐条的讨论。
    在讨论中，各单位的干部热情很高，认为这是一件非常光荣而庄严的工作，都踊跃地参加会议，认真负责地提出修改和补充意见。中国国民党革命委员会中央机关和所属北京市分部的工作干部在讨论中，有很多不在职的成员冒着大雨远道赶来参加。中国民主促进会、中国农工民主党等中央机关和所属北京市机关的干部，都讨论了十次以上。中国致公党中央机关的干部共讨论了二十次。各单位在讨论中充分发扬了民主。有些单位并热烈地展开了辩论。中国国民党革命委员会中央机关和所属北京市分部的工作干部，还在会后自由结合起来，广泛交换对宪法草案的意见。据中国国民党革命委员会、中国农工民主党、九三学社三个民主党派中央机关和所属北京市机关的统计，在讨论中提出的修改、补充意见和问题共有九百八十三条。
    经过对宪法草案的讨论，各民主党派机关的干部对宪法草案的基本精神和主要内容有了比较进一步的理解。他们在讨论中批判了资产阶级在宪法问题上的反动理论，揭露了资本主义宪法的虚伪性和反动本质；并从解放以来自己的亲身生活体验中，进一步认识到我国人民民主制度的优越性，认识到我国广大人民在工人阶级领导下建设社会主义的具体道路。有的干部回忆起在旧社会不民主、不自由和在海外遭受帝国主义迫害的情形，从过去和现在的对比中，深深感到宪法草案充满了民主精神。有的干部感动地说：只有在工人阶级领导下的人民民主国家里，人民的民主权利才能得到真正的保障。在讨论中，大家对过渡时期的人民民主统一战线的性质和任务也有了进一步的认识，认为我国人民民主统一战线在今后完成国家在过渡时期的总任务和反对内外敌人的斗争中，将继续发挥它的作用。大家表示：在宪法颁布后，要切实地遵守宪法，执行宪法，在中国共产党的领导下，团结和带动所联系的群众，加强社会主义的思想改造，更好地做好工作。
