Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 2nd: The Korean-Chinese side's civil police captured three US armed personnel on the morning of August 30th in Hajeonhyeon and Ganjeonhyeon, south of Kimseong, who were dispatched by the US side, crossed the military demarcation line, and entered our side's demilitarized zone to engage in hostile acts. Based on the Korean-Chinese side's proposal, the Fourth Joint Observer Team met at 3:00 PM on the 1st to conduct a joint investigation into this US side's violation of the armistice agreement.

During the joint investigation, the Korean-Chinese side's civil police, Choi Dong-gyu, Kang Chang-ik, and Lee Seung-ryeol (all Korean nationals), testified that at approximately 6:00 AM on August 30th, while patrolling in the demilitarized zone, they discovered one US armed personnel (Bang Gi-ho) walking from south to north. They captured him in Hajeonhyeon, near the northern border of the demilitarized zone. Based on Bang Gi-ho's confession, they then captured two US armed personnel, Lee Seung-bok and Bang In-chan, in Ganjeonhyeon, south of Hajeonhyeon. During the capture of these three US armed personnel, they seized two US-made pistols, one submachine gun, one small camera and one telescope each, three daggers, and forged documents.

During the joint investigation, Bang Gi-ho and the others confessed to the process of being dispatched by the US military authorities and invading our side's demilitarized zone. All three belonged to the BMC intelligence team of the 8097th unit of the US Eighth Army Intelligence Division, stationed between Inje and Gwangdae-ri in South Korea. On August 28th, their intelligence team leader, US Army Lieutenant Michael, dispatched them to the Kimseong area near the Korean-Chinese side to collect military intelligence and steal various documents of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Before dispatching them, they were issued forged Korean People's Army uniforms, US-made pistols, and other items.

At 11:00 AM on August 28th, accompanied by intelligence team adjutant Kim Young-bok, a liaison officer from the ROK Second Corps Intelligence Division, and eight US soldiers, Bang Gi-ho and the others departed from their base in a medium-sized jeep. Traveling via Chuncheon and other places, they arrived at Height 734, south of the northern border of the demilitarized zone northeast of Kimhwa, that evening at 7:00 PM. They were then escorted by adjutant Kim Young-bok and two US military police officers into Bukjeongnyeong in the US side's area of the demilitarized zone. On the evening of the 29th, they departed from this location again, crossing the military demarcation line at 5:00 AM on the 30th and invading the Korean-Chinese side's demilitarized zone. Bang Gi-ho and the others were captured by the Korean-Chinese side's civil police while searching for hiding places after dispersing.

In his confession, Bang Gi-ho also confirmed the violation of the armistice agreement on August 10th, when three US military personnel invaded our side's demilitarized zone near Mundeong-ri and attacked our side's civil police. He said: "The original dispatch location for the armed personnel from the BMC intelligence team was near Mundeong-ri, but because Kim Deok-jun, Kim Won-seok, Kim Chang-woon, and the other three who were dispatched on the evening of August 10th were discovered by the Korean-Chinese side's civil police while crossing the military demarcation line and fled back, with two of them injured, the dispatch location was changed to the Ganjeonhyeon area this time."

The US side's members dared not question these three US armed personnel, claiming that they did not recognize them. They also attempted to deny the evidence seen at the scene. Our side's members refuted the US side's evasion of facts based on witness testimonies and evidence, pointing out that the witness testimonies clearly proved that the three US military personnel crossed the military demarcation line and invaded our side's area to engage in hostile acts and had been captured by us.

The Fourth Joint Observer Team will meet at 2:00 PM on the 3rd to discuss submitting a report to the Military Armistice Commission.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 5th: The Fourth Joint Observer Team of the Korean Military Armistice Commission met at 2:00 PM on the 3rd to discuss the issue of submitting a joint report to the Military Armistice Commission regarding the violation of the armistice agreement by the three US armed personnel who crossed the military demarcation line and invaded our side's demilitarized zone on August 30th.

The Korean-Chinese side's members suggested submitting a special report to the Military Armistice Commission based on the facts already established during the joint investigation on September 1st. During that joint investigation, the Korean-Chinese side's civil police, Choi Dong-gyu, Kang Chang-ik, and Lee Seung-ryeol, testified, describing the process of capturing the three US armed personnel on August 30th. At the same time, the US armed personnel, Bang Gi-ho, Lee Seung-bok, and Bang In-chan, who were captured by the Korean-Chinese side, also confessed how they were dispatched by the BMC intelligence team of the 8097th unit of the US Eighth Army Intelligence Division, and how they crossed the military demarcation line to invade our side's demilitarized zone. In his confession, Bang Gi-ho also confirmed the violation of the armistice agreement on August 10th, when three US military personnel invaded our side's demilitarized zone near Mundeong-ri and attacked our side's civil police. During the joint investigation, both sides' members also examined various pieces of evidence such as US-made pistols and maps.

The Korean-Chinese side's members suggested including the following judgment in the special report regarding this US side's violation of the armistice agreement: "Based on the witnesses, testimonies during the on-site investigation, the confessions of the three United Nations Command armed personnel captured by the Korean-Chinese side's civil police, and the material evidence they carried, it is clearly proven that at approximately 11:00 AM on August 28, 1954, three United Nations Command armed personnel belonging to the BMC intelligence team of the 8097th unit of the US Eighth Army Intelligence Division were personally instructed by US Army Lieutenant Michael to gather intelligence on the Korean-Chinese side, and were issued weapons, maps, telescopes, cameras, etc. They crossed the military demarcation line at approximately 5:00 AM on August 30 and invaded the demilitarized zone under the jurisdiction of the Korean-Chinese side to engage in hostile acts." The US side's members completely disregarded the witness testimonies, the confessions of the captured US armed personnel, and the evidence in the joint investigation, insisting that there was no evidence to prove that the US side dispatched armed personnel to engage in hostile acts, and repeatedly proposed adjournment three times, refusing to discuss the joint report. After refuting the US side's unreasonable denial one by one, the Korean-Chinese side's members pointed out that the US side bears full responsibility for this violation of the armistice agreement. The Korean-Chinese side's members also decided to submit the aforementioned special report to the Military Armistice Commission separately.

    朝中方面向朝鲜军事停战委员会提出报告
    指责美方派遣武装人员侵入我方地区
    【新华社开城二日电】朝中方面民政警察八月三十日清晨在金城以南的下榛岘和间榛岘捕获了由美方派遣越过军事分界线侵入我方非军事区进行敌对行为的三名美方武装人员。根据朝中方面的建议，第四联合观察小组于一日下午三时会晤，对美方的这一违反停战协定事件进行了共同调查。
    朝中方面民政警察崔东奎、姜昌益、李承烈三人（均朝鲜籍）在共同调查时作证说，八月三十日清晨六时许，他们在非军事区执行巡逻任务时，发现美方武装人员一人（方基镐）正由南向北走来，他们在邻近非军事区北沿的下榛岘将他捕获。根据方基镐的供词，他们又在下榛岘以南的间榛岘捕获了美方武装人员李承福、方仁赞二人。在捕获这三名美方武装人员时，共缴获了美国制手枪二支、冲锋枪一支、小型照相机及望远镜各一具、短刀三把和伪造的证件等物。
    方基镐等三人在共同调查时供述了他们被美方军事机关派遣及侵入我方非军事区的经过。他们三人都属于美第八军情报处八零九七部队BMC谍报队，驻在南朝鲜的麟蹄与广大里之间。八月二十八日，谍报队队长美国陆军中尉迈克尔派遣他们到金城附近朝中方面地区搜集军事情报，劫夺朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的各种证件。在派出前，发给他们伪造的朝鲜人民军军服、美国制的手枪等物。
    八月二十八日十一时，由谍报队副官金英福和李伪军第二军团情报处联络官及美国兵等八人陪同方基镐等三人，乘中型吉普由驻地出发，经春川等地于当晚七时到达金化东北非军事区南沿的七三四高地，随即在副官金英福及二名美方军事警察的护送下进入非军事区美方地区的北亭岭。二十九日晚他们再从此地出发，在三十日晨五时越过军事分界线侵入朝中方面非军事区。方基镐等三人在分散后找寻潜伏地点时，先后被朝中方面的民政警察捕获。
    方基镐在供词中还证实了八月十日美方三名军事人员在文登里附近侵入我方非军事区袭击我方民政警察的违反停战协定事件。他说：BMC谍报队派出武装人员的地点原来是在文登里附近，但因为八月十日晚派出的金德俊、金元石、金昌云等三人在越过军事分界线时被朝中方面民政警察发觉后逃回，其中两人受伤，因此这次的派遣地点才改在间榛岘一带。
    美方组员不敢询问这三名美方武装人员，他声称他不认识这三个人。他也企图否认在现场看到的证物。我方组员根据证人证词及证物驳斥美方逃避事实，指出证人证词清楚地证明三名美方军事人员越过军事分界线侵入我方地区进行敌对行为，并已被我捕获。
    第四联合观察小组将于三日下午二时会晤，讨论向军事停战委员会提出报告。
    【新华社开城五日电】朝鲜军事停战委员会第四联合观察小组于三日下午二时会晤，讨论就八月三十日三名美方武装人员越过军事分界线侵入我方非军事区的违反停战协定事件向军事停战委员会提出共同报告的问题。
    朝中方面组员建议根据九月一日共同调查中已经确立的事实，向军事停战委员会提出特别报告。在那次共同调查中，有朝中方面民政警察崔东奎、姜昌益、李承烈等三人出场作证，叙述了他们在八月三十日捕获三名美方武装人员的经过。同时，被朝中方面捕获的美方武装人员方基镐、李承福、方仁赞等也供述了他们怎样被美第八军情报处八零九七部队BMC谍报队派遣，和怎样越过军事分界线侵入我方非军事区的经过。方基镐在供词中还证实了八月十日美方三名军事人员在文登里附近侵入我方非军事区袭击我方民政警察的违反停战协定事件。双方组员在共同调查中还察看了美国制的手枪、地图等各项证物。
    朝中方面组员建议在特别报告中对这次美方违反停战协定事件作出如下的判语：“根据现场调查中的证人、证词及被朝中方面民政警察捕获的三名联合国军方面武装人员的供词和他们所携带的物证，均清楚地证明：在一九五四年八月二十八日十一时左右，隶属于美第八军情报处八零九七部队BMC谍报队的三名联合国军方面的武装人员，由美国陆军中尉迈克尔亲自交代了刺探朝中方面情报的任务，并发给武器、地图、望远镜、照像机等，于八月三十日五时左右越过军事分界线侵入朝中方面管辖下的非军事区进行敌对行为。”美方组员完全无视共同调查中的证人证词，被捕获的美方武装人员的供词及证物，硬说是没有证据证明美方派遣武装人员进行敌对行为，并连续三次提议休会，拒绝讨论共同报告。　　朝中方面组员对美方组员这种无理抵赖行为逐一予以驳斥后，指出美方对这次违反停战协定事件始终负有完全责任。朝中方面组员并决定将上述特别报告单独提交军事停战委员会。
