    Yichang Prefecture Fully Begins Autumn Harvest

    The autumn harvest in Yichang Prefecture, Hubei Province, has fully commenced. During the autumn harvest, due to the conscientious implementation of the Provincial Party Committee's instructions on increasing grain production by another 2 billion jin, and by focusing on mutual aid and cooperation, the autumn harvest work not only achieved "careful harvesting and threshing, with every grain stored in the granary" but also cultivated ratooning rice after harvesting. According to incomplete statistics from seven counties including Yidu, Yichang, Changyang, and Zhijiang, more than 160,000 mu of rice have been harvested, and 150,000 mu of ratooning rice have been cultivated, accounting for more than 91% of the harvested land, with an estimated yield of more than 17.7 million jin of ratooning rice. In order to ensure that every grain is stored in the granary and no grain is wasted, farmers in various places have adopted methods such as "bundling rice on reed mats," "threshing grain in plank granaries," and "small bundles and light carrying," thus achieving great results. In Luzhu Township, Yidu County, 172 mu of rice were harvested in one day, and more than 370 jin of grain were harvested due to the use of reed mats to bundle the rice. (Tian Shengluan)

    宜昌专区全面开始秋收
    湖北省宜昌专区的秋收工作，已全面开始。在秋收中，由于认真贯彻了省委关于再增产二十亿斤粮食的指示，并抓住以互助合作为中心开展秋收工作，因而秋收工作不仅作到了“细收细打、颗粒归仓”，而且收割后就培育了再生稻。据宜都、宜昌、长阳、枝江等七个县不完全统计，已割稻谷十六万多亩，培育再生稻十五万亩，占收割地的百分之九十一以上，预计可收再生谷一千七百余万斤。为了做到颗粒归仓，不浪费一粒粮食，各地农民采取了“捆谷垫芦席”、“打谷用板仓”、“小捆轻挑”等办法，因此，取得很大成绩。宜都县芦竹乡一天割谷一百七十二亩，由于用芦席垫着捆谷，多收谷有三百七十多斤。　（田盛銮）
