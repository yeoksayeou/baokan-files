    Art Workers Need to Study Hard
    Jiang Feng
    Some people criticize our art workers for not reading. Although this is an exaggeration and cannot be generalized, we should admit that it is true that many art workers lack the interest and habit of reading.
    The oral examination results of many art cadres who recently applied for the advanced training class for art cadres at the Central Academy of Fine Arts fully exposed this fact. These cadres generally have more than five years of experience in art work, but the lack of cultural knowledge among the majority of them is simply unbelievable. For such general knowledge questions, such as which historical dynasties existed between the Zhou and Qing dynasties, only ten out of thirty-six people basically answered correctly. Even for historical dynasties after the Tang Dynasty, many people did not give complete or correct answers; some missed the Song or Yuan dynasties, some arbitrarily reversed the order of the dynasties, and some could not even name dynasties such as Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing. Another example is asking which continent countries like Guatemala, Finland, Egypt, Israel, and Nepal are located in; only four out of twenty-eight people answered correctly. Many people could not answer which continent these countries were on, and some answered incorrectly: some answered that Guatemala was in North America, some answered that it was in Indochina; some answered that Finland was in Africa, some answered that it was in the Americas, and some answered that it was in Asia; some answered that Egypt was in Australia, some answered that it was in Asia, and some answered that it was in Europe; some answered that Israel was in Africa, and some answered that it was in the Americas; some answered that Nepal was in Europe, some answered that it was in the Americas, and some even answered that Nepal was in the Soviet Union.
    The knowledge of literature and art is equally lacking. According to the oral examination, only one or two candidates had read "Water Margin". There have been many articles introducing the author and content of "Water Margin" in newspapers and periodicals in recent years, but eight people still do not know who the author of Water Margin is. Although some people know that "Water Margin" is a story about peasant uprisings, they are not clear about which dynasty the peasant uprising took place in, mistakenly answering it as Ming Dynasty, late Ming and early Qing Dynasty, Tang Dynasty, Jin Dynasty, and even "late Yuan and early Qing Dynasty". A quarter of the people also did not know that Zhou Libo's novel "The Hurricane" won the Stalin Prize.
    The candidates not only lack general cultural knowledge but also lack knowledge related to their own profession. Only four people knew which country and century Rembrandt was a painter from; less than half knew where Dunhuang and Yungang, two ancient art treasures, were located.
    The situation of answering the following test question shows that some art cadres do not read newspapers frequently and do not care about current affairs, so that nearly one-third of the candidates do not know about such major international political events as the joint statement between the Prime Ministers of China and India and the five basic principles included in the joint statement between the Prime Ministers of China and Burma, and some people say it is "defending peace and not exporting revolution".
    The insufficient political, cultural, and artistic cultivation of art workers is not an isolated phenomenon. The poor oral examination results of the above-mentioned thirty-six art cadres show that the cultivation of general art workers is also not very high. Cultivation is not innate. As long as one is willing to study hard, it can be gradually improved. The problem that exists among many art workers today is precisely that they are unwilling to study hard and do not realize the importance of improving their cultivation. They often think that they can achieve great artistic achievements by relying on some technical conditions or some cleverness, so they have such a wrong idea: art work only needs to focus on technical training, and whether or not there is a certain political and artistic cultivation is irrelevant. This narrow professional view seriously affects the improvement of creative level. The current shortcomings in art creation, such as the lack of ideological content, the poverty of themes and imagination, are, in my opinion, inseparable from the lack of political and artistic cultivation and the narrow vision of art workers. In order to improve the level of art creation and to make art workers highly culturally knowledgeable, we must resolutely fight against the narrow professional views that have always underestimated political and cultural cultivation. Can an artist without a certain political and cultural cultivation create works that can educate the masses? Can he become an "engineer of the soul"? This is impossible.
    It is necessary for art workers to seize technical study and improve their descriptive ability. Especially at present, when the technical level of general art workers is far from meeting the needs of the masses, technical training is even more important and should become an urgent task. In recent years, the trend of learning technology has gradually become popular among art workers in various places, which is undoubtedly a very gratifying thing. However, it should be pointed out that although general art workers are very eager to learn technology, their spirit of diligence and hard work is still very poor, often doing things by fits and starts, lacking continuity and the perseverance to overcome difficulties. Some people use being busy at work as an excuse, and often lack the determination to change this situation, so their skills become more and more rusty, and they feel more and more that their hands cannot do what they want when creating. I think that even if you are very busy at work, you can always squeeze out one or two hours a day to do some sketching exercises; however, very few people do this. Artistic achievements are accumulated bit by bit, just as the famous Soviet painter Zhukov told us, his pocket has never been without a sketchbook for ten years, and he does not relax his sketching practice even in the three to five minutes of free time while waiting for the tram. He has sketched his two children alone in three thousand pieces. Zhukov's spirit of hard work and striving deserves our good study. If you want to achieve something in art, you must learn Zhukov's spirit of artistic labor anytime and anywhere.
    The purpose of writing this short article is to arouse art workers to face up to the serious inadequacy of their political cultivation and cultural and artistic cultivation, and then to be determined to change this situation; otherwise, if they are still content with the status quo and do not make hard efforts, they will lag further behind and be in danger of being eliminated. The People's Daily editorial on July 15 has seriously issued a call to improve the political and artistic cultivation of literary and art cadres, and emphatically pointed out: "Our literary and art workers should regard political study and professional study as their major responsibility. Only in this way can they shoulder the tasks entrusted by the Party and the people." Art workers should, together with other literary and art workers, strive to respond to this call with their practical actions, and resolutely fight for improving their political, artistic and cultural cultivation!

### 美术工作者需要刻苦学习

    美术工作者需要刻苦学习
    江丰
    有人批评我们美术工作者是不读书的。这虽然是夸大之词，而且也不能一概而论，但是我们应该承认：不少美术工作者缺乏读书的兴趣和习惯，的确是事实。
    从最近投考中央美术学院美术干部进修班许多美术干部的口试结果，充分暴露了这一事实。这些干部的美术工作资历，一般都在五年以上，但他们中间的大多数，文化知识的贫乏，简直难以令人置信。像这样一类常识问题，如从周到清中间有那些历史朝代，三十六人中基本上答对的只有十个人。就是唐以下的历史朝代，还有不少人答不全或答错的，有的中间缺了宋代或元代，有的把朝代的次序任意颠倒，还有的连唐宋元明清这些朝代也说不出来。又如问危地马拉、芬兰、埃及、以色列、尼泊尔等国在那一洲，二十八人中仅有四人答对。有不少人回答不出这些国家在那一洲，有些人回答错了：有的答危地马拉在北美，有的答在印度支那；有的答芬兰在非洲，有的答在美洲，有的答在亚洲；有的答埃及在澳洲，有的答在亚洲，有的答在欧洲；有的答以色列在非洲，有的答在美洲；有的答尼泊尔在欧洲，有的答在美洲，有的竟回答尼泊尔在苏联。
    文艺方面的知识同样也很缺乏。根据口试的情况看来，考生中读过“水浒”的不过一、二人，报刊上介绍“水浒”的作者和内容的文章近年来并不少，然而仍有八人不知水浒的作者是谁。有些人虽然知道“水浒”是描写农民暴动的故事，但却搞不清楚是那一朝代的农民暴动，竟错答为明代、明末清初、唐代、晋代，甚至有答为“元末清初”的。不知道周立波的小说“暴风骤雨”是获得斯大林奖金的，也有四分之一的人数。
    考生们不仅一般的文化知识十分贫乏，就是有关自己业务方面的知识也很不足。知道林勃兰是哪一国哪一世纪的画家的，只四个人；知道敦煌和云岗这两个古代艺术宝库在那里的，也不到半数。
    从回答下面一个试题的情况可以看出：有些美术干部是不经常看报、不关心时事的，以致像中国和印度两国总理联合声明和中国与缅甸两国总理联合声明中所包括的五项基本原则是什么，这样国际政治上的重大事件，还有将近三分之一的考生不知道，有的人把它说成是“保卫和平，不输出革命”。
    美术工作者的政治、文化艺术的修养不足，并不是个别的现象。上述三十六个美术干部的口试成绩不好，一般美术工作者的修养也不很高。修养不是生来就有的，只要肯刻苦学习，是可以逐渐提高的。今天在不少美术工作者中间存在着的问题，恰恰是不肯刻苦学习，而且并没有意识到提高自己修养的重要性。他们往往以为凭借自己的一些技术条件或一些小聪明，就可以在艺术上获得高度的成就，因而产生了这样的错误想法：搞美术的只要抓紧技术锻炼就行，至于有没有一定的政治和艺术修养那是无关重要的。由于这种狭隘的专业观点，严重影响了创作水平的提高。目前美术创作上的思想性不高、题材和想像力贫乏等缺点，我以为这与美术工作者的政治艺术修养不足、眼界狭窄，是分不开的。为了提高美术创作的水平，为了使美术工作者成为具有高度文化知识的人，必须向一贯轻视政治和文化修养的狭隘的专业观点进行坚决斗争。难道一个美术家不具有一定的政治和文化的修养，能够创作出可以教育群众的作品么？能够成为“灵魂的工程师”么？这是不可能的事情。
    美术工作者要求抓紧技术学习，提高自己的描写能力，那是必要的。特别在目前，一般美术工作者的技术水平远不能满足群众要求的情况下，技术的锻炼更显得重要，应当成为刻不容缓的任务。近年来，学习技术的风气，已在各地的美术工作者中间逐渐普遍起来了，这无疑是一件极可喜的事情。但是应该指出：一般美术工作者要求学习技术虽然很迫切，勤学苦练的精神却还很差，常常是三天打鱼两天晒网，缺乏经常性和克服困难的毅力。有的人以工作忙为理由，往往缺乏改变这个状况的决心，因而技术越来越生疏，创作时也就越来越感到手不从心之苦。我以为就是工作很忙，每天挤出一、二小时作些速写练习，总是可以做得到的；然而很少有人这样做。艺术上的成就，都是由一点一滴的劳动积累起来的，正如苏联著名画家茹可夫告诉我们的那样，他的口袋里十年来从没有离开过速写本，就是在等电车的三、五分钟的空隙时间，也不放松速写的练习，他单单画他的两个小孩的速写，就有三千件。茹可夫的这种刻苦努力的进取精神，值得我们很好的学习。如果想要在艺术上有所成就，非学习茹可夫的随时随地进行艺术劳动的精神不可。
    我写这篇短文，目的是希望能引起美术工作者们正视自己的政治修养和文化艺术修养的严重不足的状况，进而下决心改变这个状况；否则，如果还是安于现状，不作刻苦的努力，那就会更加落后，有被淘汰的危险。七月十五日的人民日报的社论，已严重地提出了提高文艺干部的政治修养和艺术修养的号召，并着重指出：“我们的文学艺术工作者应该把政治学习和业务学习看作自己的一个重大责任，只有这样，才能担负起党和人民所付托的任务。”美术工作者应该与其他的文艺工作者一起，努力以自己的实际行动来响应这个号召，为提高自己的政治、艺术和文化的修养而坚决奋斗！
