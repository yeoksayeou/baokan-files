(Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, 7th) Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, 7th: General Văn Tiến Dũng, Chief of Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army to the Central Joint Ceasefire Committee in Vietnam, wrote to General De Lattre, Chief of Delegation of the Command of the French Union Forces, protesting the recent violations of the ceasefire agreement by the French Union Forces.

In his letter, General Văn Tiến Dũng stated: We have received many letters from people in various regions condemning the French Union Forces' violations of the Geneva Accords—infringements upon the lives, property, and democratic freedoms of the people. The most serious of these acts is the forced relocation of residents to the South.

General Văn Tiến Dũng pointed out: To carry out this relocation, the French Union Forces have conducted or condoned the Ngô Đình Diệm government in carrying out the following activities: (1) Using all intelligence and propaganda organs and newspapers in areas where the French Union Forces are temporarily stationed to carry out false propaganda, with the aim of creating an atmosphere of panic to deceive residents and incite them to evacuate.

	(2) Conducting roundups of many people, followed by forcing them to evacuate, and using terror tactics against those who resist.

General Văn Tiến Dũng cited many examples to illustrate that such incidents have occurred in various regions. General Văn Tiến Dũng also pointed out that even in Hanoi, the French Union Forces, in cooperation with the Ngô Đình Diệm government's police, carried out "sweeps," arresting thousands of people and forcing them to move to the South. From August 15th to 29th alone, in these two weeks, according to incomplete statistics, there were thirty-two large-scale arrests, with a total of nine hundred and forty-five people arrested in Hanoi and the suburbs of Hanoi. Zhang Wenming, the principal of "Xishan" Middle School in Hanoi, and his family were illegally arrested simply because they were unwilling to be forcibly relocated to the South.

General Văn Tiến Dũng said: These actions by the French Union Forces have caused panic among the residents currently living in areas where the French Union Forces are temporarily stationed. Many people have been forced to leave their homes and live miserable lives. This has aroused great indignation among the residents.

General Văn Tiến Dũng pointed out: The above-mentioned actions are in complete violation of the provisions of the Geneva Accords, and the Command of the French Union Forces should bear full responsibility for these actions taken by its troops or the agents of the Ngô Đình Diệm government.

On behalf of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army, General Văn Tiến Dũng strongly protested in the letter against this sabotage of the Geneva Accords by the French Union Forces and demanded that the Command of the French Union Forces immediately cease such actions, send all those who have been forcibly relocated back to their original residences, and release all those who have been arrested for opposing forced relocation. General Văn Tiến Dũng also demanded that the Command of the French Union Forces take all necessary measures when withdrawing from Hanoi in the future to prevent acts of looting, rape, and kidnapping, such as those that occurred when the French Union Forces withdrew from Nam Định, Phủ Lý, Bắc Ninh, and Vĩnh Phúc.

    文进勇将军致函戴尔特尔
    抗议法方违反停战协定强迫居民南撤
    【新华社七日讯】据越南通讯社北越七日讯：越南中央联合停战委员会中的越南人民军总司令部代表团首席代表文进勇将军写信给法兰西联邦部队总司令部代表团首席代表戴尔特尔将军，抗议法兰西联邦部队最近违反停战协定的行为。
    文进勇将军在信里说：我们收到各个地区人民的许多来信，谴责法兰西联邦部队违反日内瓦协定的行为——侵犯人民的生命、财产和民主自由。这些行为中最严重的就是强迫居民撤到南部去。
    文进勇将军指出：为了进行这种撤退，法兰西联邦部队进行了或者纵容吴庭艳政府进行了下列活动：（一）利用法兰西联邦部队暂时驻扎的地区的所有情报、宣传机构和报纸进行虚伪的宣传，目的在于制造恐慌气氛，来欺骗居民，怂恿他们撤走。
      （二）向许多人进行围捕，随后就强迫他们撤走，并且用恐怖手段对付那些反抗的人。
    文进勇将军列举许多例证，说明在各个地区都发生了这种事件。文进勇将军并且指出，甚至在河内，法兰西联邦部队在吴庭艳政府的警察的合作下也进行“扫荡”，逮捕了成千的人，强迫他们移到南方去。单是从八月十五日到二十九日这两周间，据不完全的统计，就曾经有过三十二次大规模的逮捕，在河内和河内市郊共有九百四十五个人被捕去。河内“西山”中学校长张文明和他的家人，仅仅为了不愿意被强迫撤到南方去就被非法逮捕。
    文进勇将军说：法兰西联邦部队的这些行为，已经使得那些目前住在法兰西联邦部队暂时驻扎地区内的居民们发生恐慌。好些人已经被迫离开了家而过着悲惨的生活。这已经引起居民极大的愤慨。
    文进勇将军指出：上述的行为完全违背日内瓦协定条款的规定，法兰西联邦部队总司令部应对它的部队或者吴庭艳政府的特务们所做的这些行为负完全责任。
    文进勇将军代表越南人民军总司令部在信件中强烈地抗议法兰西联邦部队这种破坏日内瓦协定的行为，并要求法兰西联邦部队总司令部立刻停止这种行为，把所有那些曾被强迫撤走的人送回原来的住处，释放所有那些由于反对强迫撤走而被捕的人。文进勇将军并且要求法兰西联邦部队总司令部在将来从河内撤退时采取一切必要的措施，以防止像法兰西联邦部队从南定、府里、北宁和永福等地撤退时所曾经发生的劫掠、强奸和捕人等行为。
