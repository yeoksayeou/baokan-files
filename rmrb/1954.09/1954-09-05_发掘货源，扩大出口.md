    Exploit Sources of Goods, Expand Exports
    Yu Lihong
    Expanding the quantity of existing export commodities, and discovering and expanding new export commodities, is an important task in developing foreign trade and supporting the country's socialist industrialization.
    Our country has great potential for export goods. Judging from the export volume of our main native and special products, according to statistics of 146 kinds of export native and special products, in 1953 it was equivalent to 78.52 percent of the pre-war 1936 exports, and has not yet reached the pre-war export volume. In addition, many native and special products that can be exported have not been well organized for export. According to incomplete statistics in 1953, there are more than 1,630 kinds of native and special products in the country, many of which can be exported, but the state-owned native product export company directly operates the export of less than 400 kinds. In the future, with the development of my country's industrial construction, the industrial products available for export will also increase day by day.
    At present, various regions have begun to pay attention to the work of exploiting sources of goods and supporting exports, and have achieved some results. For example, the Shanghai Branch of the China Native Produce Export Company discovered a total of 39 kinds of export commodities from the fourth quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year that had never been exported from the Huadong port in history or had been exported in history but had been interrupted in recent years, and has organized the export of 25 kinds of commodities such as cattail mats, ramie grass fruits, and various exquisite yellow grass woven products, which have earned a lot of foreign exchange for the country. However, in order to adapt to the ever-increasing export needs, the work of exploiting and cultivating export sources of goods must continue to be strengthened.
    First, the development of the production of native and special products should be actively supported in a planned manner, which is the fundamental method to increase export sources of goods. For major native products such as tobacco and hemp, all regions should implement the policy of planned development of production, strengthen technical guidance, and increase the yield per unit area; for many small native products and agricultural and sideline products in mountainous areas, farmers should be called upon to collect and collect them in a timely manner, and not to discard and waste them; for handicrafts such as lace, embroidery, carvings, lacquerware, hemp and grass, etc., assistance should be provided to improve technology, improve quality, and guide the development of production in a planned manner.
    Secondly, the purchasing work of native and special products must be strengthened. In the past, the main shortcomings in the purchasing work of native and special products were the lack of unified leadership. After the native and special products were put on the market, domestic and foreign trade units, cooperatives, and private merchants went to the production areas to purchase them, which often caused market chaos. In order to ensure that export materials can be purchased in a timely manner with guaranteed quality and quantity, before a large number of native and special products are put on the market, foreign trade companies, domestic trade companies and cooperatives should, under the unified leadership of the local financial committee, first link up the procurement plans for export materials and sign contracts and agreements. Domestic and foreign trade units should be closely integrated, fully rely on and entrust cooperatives to carry out procurement in a planned manner. The purchasing price should also be correctly grasped, which is important for guiding production. State-owned trading companies must play a leading role in prices and oppose the practice of unduly raising purchasing prices in order to rush to purchase, or arbitrarily lowering purchasing prices for products that are not selling well for a while. The control of purchasing prices should be based on supporting production, stabilizing the market, and implementing the price policy of grading prices, good goods with good prices, and inferior goods with inferior prices. Starting from the interests of production, transportation, and consumers. In addition, local industrial and commercial administrative departments must strengthen market management and stop illegal private merchants from raising prices and rushing to purchase export materials.
    Third, strengthen the production and processing of export materials, and improve specifications and quality. There are many kinds of native and special products, and the production is scattered. In the past, some native and special products were needed by the international market, but they could not be exported in large quantities because the specifications and quality did not meet foreign requirements, which was not conducive to expanding the requirements of foreign trade. Therefore, it is very important to constantly conduct publicity and education on producers to improve production and improve specifications and quality according to foreign requirements and domestic possible conditions. For example, Northwest hemp, in the past, due to poor degumming during processing and excessive hardness, affected exports. After the Northwest Branch of the China Native Produce Export Company compiled and printed popular publicity materials based on the port inspection opinions and carried out publicity and education to farmers through Northwest grass-roots trading companies and cooperatives, the hemp put on the market in 1953 met export specifications more than one-third more than in 1952.
    Fourth, strengthen investigation and research work and strive to discover new export commodities. In the past, due to insufficient investigation and research work, there were many materials that could be exported but were not known. In the first half of this year, the foreign trade department of the Northwest Region sent a working group to go deep into the production areas to purchase export materials, and discovered more than a dozen kinds of animal products and more than 30 kinds of local products that can be exported. This work must be continued in the future. Discovering and expanding new export commodities is a very complex and arduous task. Export companies, customs, domestic trade companies, and cooperatives should cooperate closely, study historical materials, hold various types of symposiums, organize export commodity information networks, conduct in-depth on-site investigations, and investigate foreign needs and domestic supply conditions.
    In order to do the above work well, it is necessary to strengthen the publicity of exploiting sources of goods and expanding exports, so that the people of the whole country can clearly realize the great significance of expanding exports to support the country's socialist industrialization. Facts have proved that as long as the truth is made clear to the vast number of grass-roots cadres and the masses, the people will increase production with unparalleled political enthusiasm, practice strict economy, and vigorously support exports. The Northwest Region is a good example because the publicity work is done well, not only the local party and government attach importance to it, the domestic trade units and cooperatives support it, but also the Xi'an Railway Bureau often supports the transportation of export commodities with the slogan "Export materials for machines, give priority to loading and transportation".

### 发掘货源，扩大出口

    发掘货源，扩大出口
    禹理洪
    扩大现有出口商品的数量，并发现和扩大新的出口商品，是发展对外贸易，支持国家社会主义工业化的一件重要的工作。
    我国出口货源的潜力很大。从我国主要土、特产的出口数量来看，据一百四十六种出口土、特产统计，一九五三年相当于战前一九三六年出口的百分之七十八点五二，尚未达到战前的出口数量。此外，很多可供出口的土、特产还未很好地组织出口。据一九五三年不完全统计，全国共有土、特产一千六百三十余种，其中很多可供出口，但国营土产出口公司直接经营出口的还不到四百种。今后随着我国工业建设的发展，可供出口的工业品也将日益增多。
    现在，各地已开始注意了发掘货源、支持出口工作，并取得了一些成绩。如中国土产出口公司上海分公司从去年第四季度到今年第一季度，共发掘了华东口岸历史上从未出口或历史上曾出口而近几年中断了的出口商品三十九种，并已组织了蒲片、拉毛草果、各种精致黄草织品等二十五种商品出口，给国家换取了大量外汇。但为了适应日益增长的出口需要，发掘和培植出口货源的工作还必须继续加强。
    首先，应该有计划地、积极地扶助土、特产生产的发展，这是增加出口货源的根本方法。各地对烟、麻等大宗土产应贯彻有计划发展生产的方针，加强技术指导，提高单位面积产量；对许多山地的小土产及农副产品，应号召农民及时采集和搜集，不要丢弃浪费；对手工艺品如花边、刺绣、雕刻、漆器、麻草等，应协助其改进技术，提高质量，有计划地指导发展生产。
    其次，必须加强对土、特产的收购工作。过去土、特产收购工作中的主要缺点是缺乏统一领导，土、特产上市后，对内对外贸易单位、合作社、私商齐赴产地收购，往往造成市场混乱现象。为了保证出口物资能按质按量及时地收购起来，在土、特产大量上市以前，对外贸易公司、国内贸易公司及合作社应在当地财委统一领导下，首先把有关出口物资的收购计划衔接起来，并签订合同和协议。国内外贸易单位应紧密结合，充分依靠和分别委托合作社有计划地进行收购。并应正确地掌握收购价格，这对指导生产有重要的作用。国营贸易公司必须在价格上起领导作用，反对为了急于收购而不适当地提高收购价格、或者对于销路一时不畅的产品任意压低收购价格的做法。收购价格的掌握应本着扶助生产、稳定市场，贯彻分等论价、优货优价、劣货劣价的价格政策。从生产、贩运、和消费者三方面的利益出发。此外，各地工商行政部门必须加强市场管理，制止不法私商抬价抢购出口物资的行为。
    第三、加强对出口物资的生产加工，改进规格和质量。土、特产种类繁多，生产分散，过去，有些土、特产虽为国际市场需要，但因规格质量不符国外要求而不能大量出口，这是不利于扩大对外贸易的要求的。所以，根据国外要求和国内可能的条件，经常对生产者进行改进生产，提高规格质量的宣传教育是十分重要的。例如西北大麻，过去由于加工脱胶不良，硬度太大，影响出口，中国土产出口公司西北分公司根据口岸检验意见，编印了通俗的宣传材料，通过西北基层贸易公司、合作社向农民进行宣传教育后，一九五三年上市的大麻，合乎出口规格的就较一九五二年多了三分之一。
    第四、加强调查研究工作，努力发现新的出口商品。过去，由于我们调查研究工作做的不够，有许多可以出口的物资不知道。今年上半年西北区对外贸易部门派出工作组深入产区收购出口物资，就发现了十余种畜产品和三十余种土产品，可以出口。今后必须继续加强这一工作。发现和扩大新的出口商品是件非常复杂和艰巨的工作，出口公司、海关、国内贸易公司、合作社应该密切配合，研究历史资料，举行各种类型的座谈会，组织出口货源通讯网，深入实地勘查，调查国外需要和国内货源情况。
      为了做好以上工作，必须加强对发掘货源、扩大出口的宣传，使全国人民都清楚的认识到扩大出口对支持国家社会主义工业化的重大意义。事实证明，只要把道理向广大基层干部和群众讲清楚，人民会以无比充沛的政治热情来增加生产，厉行节约，大力支持出口的。西北区由于宣传工作做的较好，不只地方党政重视，国内贸易单位、合作社支持，就是西安铁路局也常以“出口物资换机器，尽先装运”的口号，支持出口商品的运输工作，就是一个例子。
