Changing the Face of Life for People in Mountainous Areas
National People's Congress Representative, Deputy Director of the Finance and Economics Committee of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region People's Government, Guo Cheng

The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is a mountainous area with a large output of special local products in addition to general crops. The region produces more than 300 kinds of special local products of all sizes, including highly valuable industrial raw materials and export goods. The star anise and anise oil are among the treasures of the mountains. The annual output value of special local products in the region reaches more than 1,300 billion yuan, which accounts for a large proportion of the economic income of all ethnic groups. According to a typical survey of 112 townships, farmers' income from special local products accounts for about 60% of their total annual income. This shows that earnestly carrying out ethnic trade work and expanding the purchase of special local products play a significant role in promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production, enlivening urban and rural material exchange, stabilizing the market, improving the lives of all ethnic groups, and strengthening ethnic unity.

In recent years, under the leadership of party committees and governments at all levels, the ethnic trade work of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has developed greatly, which is reflected in the substantial increase in the total turnover of social commodities in the region year by year. For example, the total turnover of commodities in the region in 1952 increased by 8.4% compared with 1951, and in 1953 it increased by 52.4% compared with 1951. This situation is in sharp contrast to the shrinking industrial and agricultural production, the obstruction of urban and rural exchanges, and the sluggish market during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang.

The increasing development of trade work in the Zhuang Autonomous Region is due to the gradual implementation of the national policy and the Party's general task in ethnic affairs during the transition period, which ensured the development of industrial and agricultural production and the priority development of the state-owned economy, enabling state-owned trade to gradually play a leading role in the market. At present, the state-owned commerce in the region has formed a strong trade network, with 536 ethnic trade companies established, an increase of 3.2 times compared with 1951; and a total of 420 supply and marketing cooperatives established, an increase of 3 times compared with 1952. Due to the universal establishment and rapid development of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce, the proportion of socialist commerce in the market has increased year by year. This is of great significance for further improving the work of material exchange, reducing the exploitation of private commerce, and increasing the economic income of the Zhuang people.

In order to solve the difficulties of inconvenient mountain transportation, so as to better supply the means of production and livelihood to the minority nationalities and purchase their special local products, state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives have also organized "mobile purchase and sales groups" to carry out purchase and sales business in the mountainous areas. For example, last year, in coordination with the unified purchase and sale of grain, trade companies in various counties organized 505 mobile groups one after another. This not only gradually met the needs of all ethnic groups, but also greatly cracked down on the previous super-economic exploitation by speculative merchants in terms of price. Based on the activities of the mobile purchase and sales groups, some areas have gradually created periodic markets. For example, Qibainong in Du'an County is a Yao settlement area with very inconvenient transportation. In the past, there was no market, and the Yao farmers had to carry all their special local products on their shoulders to the market town more than 200 li away to sell. Now, in this remote mountainous area, the mobile purchase and sales groups have settled down, opened up new markets, and carried out full supply and vigorous purchases. Now, each market invests 3 to 4 million yuan. This has solved the difficulty of selling special local products for minority nationalities. These new markets have gradually formed the economic center of the region.

With the development of ethnic trade, market management has been strengthened, and a fair and reasonable price policy has been implemented. For example, before liberation, 30 jin of rice in the Baise area could only be exchanged for 1 jin of salt, but now only 1 jin and 10 liang of rice can be exchanged for 1 jin of salt. Before liberation, 100 jin of soybeans in the Yishan area could only be exchanged for 1 zhang of shilin cloth, but now 40 jin is enough. Last year, only the sales of five industrial products such as yarn, cloth, salt, kerosene, and general merchandise by ethnic trade companies were calculated. Due to the reduction in the average price compared with 1952, the purchasing power of the people of all ethnic groups increased by 15.2 billion yuan. In the purchase of special local products in the region, only the four types of edible oil, star anise, brown sugar, and live pigs were calculated. Due to the reasonable adjustment of prices compared with 1952, the income of the people of all ethnic groups increased by 15.8 billion yuan. As some representatives said at the National People's Congress when discussing the work report of the Zhuang Autonomous Region People's Government: "The national policy has brought us too many benefits. Just take salt as an example. Compared with the past, the money saved on salt every year can support several children."

Now, due to the restoration and development of production in the region and the vigorous development of ethnic trade, the lives of the people of all ethnic groups have undergone fundamental changes. Many areas have changed from eating coarse grains to eating white rice, from wearing old and ragged clothes to adding new clothes, fundamentally changing the tragic life of "sweet potatoes and wild vegetables for half a year" caused by the long-term oppression, exploitation, and destruction of the reactionary ruling class in the past, where they could not even see one or two taels of salt during the New Year holidays. For example, in Zuodeng District, a deep mountain canyon 40 li away from Tiandong County in the upper reaches of the Youjiang River, there are 1,482 Yao households and 2,939 Zhuang households (5 Han households). In the past, due to the Kuomintang reactionaries frequently recruiting soldiers, levying taxes, and plundering here, their production and life were extremely difficult. Among them, five households with 17 people shared a kitchen knife. In 9 villages with 1,154 households, 195 households had no pots or agricultural tools, and there was a greater shortage of耕牛, so they had to use wooden plows to cultivate the land. Now, under the brilliant light of the Chinese Communist Party's national policy, their production and life have changed. They have land and houses, and each person has an average of two agricultural tools, each household raises one and a half pigs, and the number of耕牛 in the district has increased to more than 1,000. Therefore, Huang Yishen, a Zhuang poor peasant, said with deep emotion: "I never dreamed that my life of decades or hundreds of years would be changed in recent years. Not only do I have clothes to wear, but I also have clothes to change, and I have two mosquito nets and three quilts. The pots and bowls are also complete, and I also have a cow. All these benefits were brought about by liberation. I will never forget the Communist Party and Chairman Mao."

    改变了山区人民生活的面貌
    全国人民代表大会代表  广西省桂西僮族自治区人民政府财政经济委员会副主任  郭城
    广西省桂西僮族自治区是一个多山地区，除一般农作物外，土特产产量最大。全区共产三百余种大小土特产品，其中有价值很高的工业原料和出口物资，像大红八角和五角茴油等，都是在世界市场上被誉为“山中之宝”的珍品。全区土特产每年产值达一万三千多亿元，它占各族人民经济收入的比重很大。根据一百一十二个乡的典型调查，农民土特产的收入占一年总收入的百分之六十左右。这就说明：认真开展民族贸易工作，扩大对土特产收购，对于促进工农业生产的发展，活跃城乡物资交流，稳定市场，改善各族人民生活，加强民族团结方面，都起着重大作用。
    几年来，桂西僮族自治区的民族贸易工作在各级党委和政府的领导下，有了很大发展，这表现在全区社会商品流转总额年年都有很大增长。譬如：一九五二年全区商品流转总额较一九五一年增长百分之八点四，一九五三年又比一九五一年增长百分之五十二点四。这种情况恰和国民党反动统治时期工农业生产日渐萎缩、城乡交流阻塞、市场萧条的现象成了很鲜明的对比。
    僮族自治区贸易工作的日益发展，是由于逐步贯彻民族政策和过渡时期党在民族方面的总任务，保证了工农业生产的发展与国营经济的优先发展，使国营贸易在市场上逐渐发挥了领导作用的缘故。现在全区国营商业已经形成一个强有力的贸易网，设立了民族贸易公司五百三十六个，比一九五一年增加了三点二倍；供销合作社共设机构四百二十个，比一九五二年增加了三倍。由于国营商业和合作社商业的机构普遍建立和迅速发展，就使得社会主义商业在市场上的经营比重逐年增加。这对进一步做好物资交流工作，减少私营商业的剥削，增加僮族人民经济收入，都具有重要意义。
    为了解决山地交通不便的困难，以便更好地供应少数民族人民的生产和生活资料与收购他们的土特产品，国营商业和供销合作社还组织了“流动购销组”，深入山区开展购销业务。如去年配合粮食统购统销工作，各县贸易公司即先后组织了五百零五个流动组。这不但逐步满足了各族人民的需要，在价格上也大大地打击了投机奸商以往超经济的剥削。由流动购销组的活动做基础，有的地区并逐步创造定期成墟的市场。如都安县七百弄，是瑶族聚居的地区，交通极不方便，过去没有市场，瑶族农民所有的土特产要用肩挑到离二百多里远的墟镇去卖。现在，在这个深远的山区，流动购销组固定下来，开辟了新的市场，进行充分供应与大力收购，现在每墟只投放款就有三、四百万元。解决了少数民族的土特产出售的困难。这些新的市场已逐步形成了全区的经济中心。
    随着民族贸易事业的发展，加强了市场管理，贯彻了公平合理的价格政策。如解放前百色地区三十斤大米才能换到一斤盐，现在只需一斤十两大米就可以换到一斤盐，宜山地区解放前一百斤黄豆才换得一丈士林布，现在四十斤就行了。去年一年只以民族贸易公司方面在纱、布、盐、煤油、百货等五种工业品销售额计算，由于比一九五二年平均价格的降低，就提高了各民族人民购买力折款达一百五十二亿元。在全区土特产收购上，只以食油、八角、黄糖、毛猪等四种计算，由于价格比一九五二年合理的调整，即增加各民族人民收入一百五十八亿元，诚如此次全区人民代表大会有的代表在讨论僮族自治区人民政府工作报告时所讲：“民族政策给我们带来的好处实在太多了，只拿食盐来讲，比起过去来，每年吃盐省下的钱就可以养活几个孩子。”
    现在，由于全区生产的恢复与发展，民族贸易工作的大力展开，各族人民的生活已起了根本的变化。许多地区由吃杂粮到吃白米饭，从穿旧布烂衣到添制新装，根本改变了过去由于历史上反动统治阶级长期压迫、剥削和摧残所造成的“山薯野菜半年粮”，逢年过节还见不到一两盐巴的悲惨生活。如右江上游，离田东县城四十华里的一个深山峡谷的地方——作登区，聚居着一千四百八十二户瑶族和二千九百三十九户僮族（汉族五户），过去由于国民党反动派经常在这里抓兵、派款、掠夺，造成了他们生产、生活极端困难，其中五户十七个人共一把菜刀，有九个村一千一百五十四户中，有一百九十五户没有锅头、农具，耕牛更为缺乏，只好使用木犁耕种。现在，在中国共产党的民族政策的光辉照耀下，他们的生产、生活都变样了，他们有了田地和房子，农具平均每人已有两件，每户养猪一口半，全区耕牛已增至一千余头。所以僮族贫农黄义深为感动地说：“我做梦都没想到这几年来就改变了我几十年几百年的生活，不但有衣服穿，还有了替换的，并有了两顶蚊帐三床被，锅碗也都齐全了，还有牛一头，这一切好处都是解放带来的，我永远也忘不了共产党和毛主席。”
