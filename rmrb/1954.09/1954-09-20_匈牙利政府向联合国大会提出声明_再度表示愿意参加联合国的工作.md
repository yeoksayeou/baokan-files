Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, September 18th: The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic submitted a statement to the United Nations General Assembly stating: The Hungarian government, representing the will of its people, hereby declares to the United Nations General Assembly, reiterating its willingness to participate in the work of the United Nations, to express its views within the United Nations, and to actively participate in measures to ease international tensions and ensure lasting peace.

The statement said: The United Nations bears an important task in ensuring lasting peace. Due to the results of the Berlin Conference and the Geneva Conference, international tensions have recently eased somewhat, thus increasing the possibility of completing this task.

The statement pointed out that since 1947, the Hungarian government has repeatedly requested to join the United Nations, but without any effect, although the United Nations Charter stipulates that any peace-loving country that undertakes the obligations stipulated in the United Nations Charter may become a member of the United Nations.

The statement continued: All past activities and desires of the Government of the Hungarian People's Republic are in line with the basic principles of the United Nations. All efforts of the Hungarian government are based on the principles of equality and mutual respect for each other's interests and cooperation with all countries to strengthen peace. The statement pointed out that, recognizing the peaceful policies of the Hungarian People's Republic, the Soviet Union, India, Poland, Argentina, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, and several other countries have advocated for the admission of Hungary as a member of the United Nations at the United Nations General Assembly meetings.

The statement concluded: Admitting new member states, including the Hungarian People's Republic, will help realize the principles of the United Nations Charter, help consolidate the United Nations organization as a global organization, help resolve disputes, and thus help ease international tensions. The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic hopes that the current session of the United Nations General Assembly will, in the spirit of the United Nations Charter, agree to satisfy the legitimate aspirations of the Hungarian people.

    匈牙利政府向联合国大会提出声明
    再度表示愿意参加联合国的工作
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社布达佩斯十八日讯：匈牙利人民共和国政府向联合国大会提出声明说：匈牙利政府代表本国人民的意志，现在向联合国大会声明，再度表示愿意参加联合国的工作，在联合国表示自己的观点，积极参加缓和国际紧张局势和保障持久和平的措施。
    声明说：联合国在保障持久和平方面担负重要的任务。由于柏林会议和日内瓦会议的结果，国际紧张局势最近已有了某些缓和，因此，完成这个任务的可能性增加了。
    声明指出，从一九四七年以来匈牙利政府屡次要求加入联合国，但是没有得到任何效果，虽然联合国宪章中规定，任何承担联合国宪章所规定的义务的爱好和平的国家，都可以成为联合国会员国。
    声明接着说明：匈牙利人民共和国政府以往的全部活动和它的一切愿望都符合联合国的基本原则。匈牙利政府的一切努力，都是根据平等和互相尊重彼此利益的原则和各国进行合作，以加强和平。声明指出，由于承认匈牙利人民共和国的和平政策，苏联、印度、波兰、阿根廷、捷克斯洛伐克、瑞典和其他若干国家在联合国大会会议上都曾主张接纳匈牙利为联合国会员国。
    声明最后说：接纳包括匈牙利人民共和国在内的新会员国，有助于实现联合国宪章的原则，有助于巩固联合国组织作为世界性组织的地位，有助于解决争端，从而有助于缓和国际紧张局势。匈牙利人民共和国政府希望，联合国大会本届会议能本着联合国宪章的精神，同意满足匈牙利人民的正当愿望。
