    Experience of the General Branch of the CPC Private Qingfeng Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory No. 2 in Developing New Party Members
    Working Group of the Organization Department of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC
    The Shanghai Private Qingfeng Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory No. 2 is a factory that processes orders for the state and accepts state procurement tasks. Before the liberation of Shanghai, Qingfeng No. 2 Factory already had a Party branch organization, but there were not many Party members at that time. In the four years from the liberation of Shanghai to June 1953, through mass movements such as the anti-blockade, labor insurance registration, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the "Five-Anti" campaign, and democratic reforms, and other tasks, the political awareness of all factory workers was significantly improved, and a group of activists emerged, but very few Party members were developed. It was not until the year from July 1953 to June 1954 that the Party organization saw greater development, admitting ninety-two Party members. The nineteen large and small workshops, offices, and twenty-seven shifts that had no Party members in the past now have Party members. Currently, the number of Party members has reached 6.36 percent of the total number of employees, and a general branch and four sub-branches have been established. The newly admitted Party members are all outstanding individuals who have emerged from production and various movements, including nine advanced workers and thirteen technical workers and technicians.

    In the past year, the work of the Qingfeng No. 2 Factory's general branch in developing new Party members has always revolved around correctly implementing the Party's policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce, and the task of leading all employees in supervising capitalists to improve production, and has gained the following experiences:

    I. Strengthen ideological leadership and unify the Party's understanding of the work of developing new Party members. The work of developing new Party members in the past year has been deployed simultaneously with each stage of production and other central tasks. Before deploying the work, the general branch first investigated and analyzed the ideological situation inside and outside the Party regarding the development of new Party members, and conducted education and mobilization when deploying the work, first making the Party have a correct understanding of the work of developing new Party members. In the past year, the general branch of the factory has successively resolved the following more prominent ideological obstacles:

    Some Party members did not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of developing new Party members. Because in the four years since liberation, although very few new Party members had been admitted, a lot of work had still been done, many Party members mistakenly believed that work could be done well even without actively developing new Party members, and therefore did not pay much attention to the work of developing new Party members. These comrades did not realize that without expanding the Party organization, it would be impossible to consolidate existing work achievements and continue to move forward; they did not understand that developing a group of new Party members at that time was key to further strengthening the ties between Party members and the masses, and the tendency of closed-doorism in Party building was bound to detach the Party from the masses, especially from those activists who had emerged from previous movements and were eager to join the Party; they did not even understand that developing Party members in capitalist factories was an important condition for increasing socialist political factors and ensuring the smooth socialist transformation of capitalist industry.

    It is not clear that the work of developing new Party members in private factories must revolve around the correct implementation of the Party's policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce, and the task of leading all employees in supervising capitalists to improve production, and serve this basic task. Therefore, when selecting, educating, and observing activists, they did not focus on the above-mentioned basic task and revolve around production, but paid more attention to lifestyle and other issues.

    Various conservative ideas constantly emerged within the Party. At the beginning, some comrades had excessively high demands on development targets, believing that they must be "perfect" and have "outstanding performance," etc. For some people who actually met the conditions for joining the Party but still had some minor shortcomings, they would not develop them. For example, Zhang Baoqin, the group leader of the workshop, was of good quality and responsible in her work, but because her style was relatively blunt and she did not pay attention to the method when educating workers, some Party members thought she was "irritable" and did not want to develop her (now she has been accepted into the Party). After developing a group of new Party members, new conservative ideas emerged, such as some Party members believing that "it's almost done" and they could "take a breather," and some general branch and branch committee members were worried that "the stall is already very big and we can't lead if we develop more," etc.

    The above ideological obstacles have seriously affected the development of the work of developing new Party members. After discovering these situations, the general branch, in addition to conducting education and criticism when deploying the work, also regularly conducted education and criticism through Party lessons and general branch meetings, gradually laying the ideological foundation for actively and prudently developing new Party members.

    II. Closely revolve around the correct implementation of the Party's policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce, and the task of leading all employees in supervising capitalists to improve production, and conduct education and observation work for activists.

    The Party organization fully utilizes the positive aspects of the capitalists in the management of production; and against their pursuit of quantity over quality in production, their complaints and strange remarks in accepting the leadership of the state-owned economy, and their efforts to encourage the economic tendencies of employees, it often relies on the trade union and the Communist Youth League organizations to mobilize the masses to carry out necessary struggles. Through these practical struggles, the general branch paid attention to the education and observation of activists. The content of the education is to require them to correctly treat the relationship between public and private interests, the relationship between labor and capital, and the relationship between the state and individuals, to prevent and report capitalists from implementing the "five poisons," to supervise capitalists to improve management, improve labor conditions, and ensure that the production tasks entrusted by the state are completed on time, with quality, and comprehensively. Through repeated ideological education, they are assigned specific tasks, and their level of awareness is observed from their performance of the tasks, and then those who have a clear history and meet the standards of Party members are admitted into the Party.

    In the past year, most of the Party members received by the Qingfeng No. 2 Factory's general branch were outstanding individuals who had been tested by these educations and struggles. For example, in the struggle to rectify labor discipline and overcome economic tendencies, activists were educated and inspired to establish a sense of responsibility as masters of the country, clarify the idea of "production first," and understand that leading all employees in private factories to supervise capitalists to improve production, although beneficial to capitalists, is primarily beneficial to the working class; it was made clear that economic tendencies are a reflection of bourgeois ideology, and if the working class has this ideological tendency, it is easy to be corroded and divided by the bourgeoisie, so this tendency must be resolutely overcome. After repeated ideological education, many activists improved their awareness, drew a clear line ideologically, and voluntarily criticized their past irresponsible phenomena in production and their unconscious behavior of helping capitalists implement the "five poisons." For example, some workers, under the direction of the capitalists, passed off substandard products as first-class products and handed them over to the state, "feeling happy in their hearts" because they thought they had "taken advantage"; if they were discovered and fined, they would complain along with the capitalists, etc. On the basis of their improved awareness and understanding, the Party organization assigned them tasks, asking them to actively publicize the Party's policies to the masses and use their own exemplary actions to motivate the broad masses of employees. Chen Dingyan of the quality inspection team improved his sense of responsibility after being educated, and was particularly serious and responsible in the inspection. Once, in more than 1,200 first-class products, he found more than 100 second- and third-class products, and even substandard goods. Zhao Pinpu of the leather roller workshop no longer "complained" or "grumbled" when he received raw materials of slightly inferior quality allocated by the state, but took the initiative to actively think of ways and improve technology, thereby improving the quality of the leather rollers and reducing the breakage rate. Because they have consistently taken a clear stand and fought resolutely in these struggles, and they have a clear personal history, the general branch accepted them into the Party.

    III. Clarify the importance of developing Party work among technical workers and technical personnel, and conduct education and observation work based on their ideological characteristics.

    In order to smoothly implement the Party's policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce in private factories and to lead all employees in supervising capitalists to improve production, the Party organization must grasp every link of production. Therefore, the work of mobilizing technical workers and technical personnel plays a particularly important and even decisive role; developing Party members among technical workers and technical personnel has become a major measure to ensure that the Party grasps the production links. The Party organization of Qingfeng No. 2 Factory initially had insufficient understanding in this regard, and there were various incorrect understandings. For example, it was believed that technical workers "have deep worldly wisdom and are not easy to approach," and that "the history is complicated and there is no way to understand it"; for older veteran technicians, it was believed that "they may not live for a few years," and that spending time cultivating them was "a waste of effort"; it was believed that technical personnel "get high salaries, sit on sofas, and do not play a role," and there was resistance to the idea that "technical personnel are also part of the working class." These ideas within the Party seriously hindered the work of developing new Party members among technical workers and technical personnel. At the same time, technical workers and technical personnel also had many concerns and misunderstandings about joining the Party. For example, technical workers generally believed that they had "low culture" and "could not speak well," and that they would "have no way to lead the group" after joining the Party, or that they were afraid of too many meetings, which would affect production and rest; technical personnel generally love vanity and face, and dare not boldly expose their thoughts. They are afraid of losing face if their application is not approved, and they are also afraid of strict organizational life and being criticized if they do not do their work well, and they also have a certain degree of contempt for workers.

    Based on these ideological situations, the general branch first conducted education within the Party, emphasizing the role of technical workers and technical personnel in production, criticizing various incorrect understandings, and then the general branch carried out the following tasks among technical workers and technical personnel: (1) Absorbing them to participate in relevant meetings. When the Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee, the Quality Research Group, the branch congress, etc. discussed issues related to production and technology, they were warmly absorbed to participate, conduct political and ideological education for them, give play to their initiative and creativity, and pay attention to their suggestions, so that they feel the Party's love for them; when the branch congress discussed the issue of technical workers and technical personnel joining the Party, they were also absorbed to participate, inspiring them to connect with themselves and conduct self-education. (2) Adopt the educational method of individual contact. Generally, technical workers are educated with examples of comparing the new and old societies to inspire their class consciousness, so that they experience the glory, greatness, and correctness of the Party. For technical personnel, attention should be paid to conducting positive education, and criticism of their shortcomings should mostly be done through individual conversations, so that they feel the Party's kindness and care. Moreover, attention should be paid to selecting Party members with better production technology and a certain prestige among the masses, or responsible cadres of the branch to contact them, so that the work can be carried out more smoothly and with better results.

    Because of the emphasis on the work of developing Party members among technical workers and technical personnel and the achievements made, the role of the Party organization in leading all employees to supervise capitalists to improve production has been further enhanced; at the same time, technical workers and some technical personnel have higher prestige among the masses, and after joining the Party, they have made progress through the Party's training and education, and are able to unite the masses, openly share technology, and actively delve into production, thus further strengthening the ties between the Party and the masses, improving the Party organization's prestige, and better guaranteeing the completion of state processing orders and procurement tasks.

    IV. Strengthen business guidance on the work of developing new Party members, cultivate and train Party building backbones, and plan to arrange the time for receiving new Party members.

    The characteristic of the Party organization of Qingfeng No. 2 Factory is that there are many new Party members, and they all lack business knowledge of Party work. Therefore, strengthening business guidance on Party building work is very important. During this period, the following measures were taken: First, the time for receiving new Party members individually in batches was determined (generally at the end of each stage of production and other movements or in the gap time). With the exception of individual cases, the procedures for joining the Party are generally handled during the prescribed period. The advantage of doing so is that it is conducive to conducting business guidance on the work of developing new Party members, and it is also easier for the leadership to arrange the time for branch activities, so that the meeting time for examining and receiving new Party members will not be overwhelmed by the tense central work. Second, a group of Party building backbones were selected, their work in other areas was reduced, and they were asked to assist the branch organization committee members in checking, supervising, and specifically guiding the work of developing new Party members, and talking with the development targets, etc. Third, methods such as taking business courses (conducting education on how to correctly grasp the standards of Party members and handle the procedures for joining the Party, etc.) and holding symposiums were adopted to improve the Party building business level of the Party building backbones and all Party members.

    Experience has proved that in the case of many new Party members, a low level of professional skill in developing new Party members, and tight production tasks and other central work, it is effective to take the method of planning and arranging the time in a unified way according to each central work step, handling the procedures for joining the Party in batches and individually, and clarifying the content of education and observation of activists according to the characteristics and requirements of the central work. At the same time, it is also necessary to select an appropriate number of Party building backbones and strengthen their business guidance, so that the work of developing new Party members can be guaranteed to be closely linked to production and serve production; in this way, the plan for developing new Party members can be guaranteed to be smoothly implemented.

    中共私营庆丰纺织印染二厂总支部发展新党员工作的经验
    中共上海市委组织部工作组
    上海市私营庆丰纺织印染二厂是一个为国家加工订货，接受国家收购任务的工厂。上海解放以前，庆丰二厂就有了党的支部组织，但那时党员数量不多。从上海解放到一九五三年六月的四年中，经过反封锁、劳动保险登记、镇压反革命分子、“五反”、民主改革等群众运动和其他各项工作，全厂职工的政治觉悟有显著提高，涌现了一批积极分子，但仍很少发展党员。直至一九五三年七月到一九五四年六月的一年中，党组织才有了较大的发展，接收了党员九十二人，过去没有党员的十九个大小车间、科室和二十七个班现在都有了党员。目前党员数量已达职工总数的百分之六点三六，成立了总支和四个分支。新接收的党员都是从生产和各项运动中涌现出来的优秀分子，其中有先进工作者九人；有技术工人、技术人员十三人。
    一年来，庆丰二厂总支发展新党员工作是始终围绕着正确地贯彻党对资本主义工商业利用、限制、改造的政策和领导全体职工监督资本家搞好生产的任务进行的，并获得了如下几点经验：
    一、加强思想领导，统一党内对发展新党员工作的认识。一年来发展新党员的工作，是和每一阶段的生产和其他中心工作同时部署的。在部署工作以前，总支先调查分析了党内外对于发展新党员的思想情况，在部署工作时进行教育动员，首先使党内对发展新党员的工作有正确的认识。一年来该厂总支曾经先后解决了以下几种比较突出的思想障碍：
    有些党员对发展新党员工作的重要意义认识不足。由于解放以后四年中，虽接收的新党员很少，而工作还是做得很多，就使很多党员错误地认为不积极地发展新党员同样可以搞好工作，因而对发展新党员的工作不很重视。这些同志没有认识到不扩大党的组织就不可能巩固已有的工作成绩并继续前进；不了解在当时发展一批新党员是进一步密切党员与群众联系的关键，而建党工作中的关门主义倾向势必使党脱离群众，特别是脱离那些从历次运动中涌现出来的迫切要求入党的积极分子；他们更不了解在资本主义工厂中发展党员是增加社会主义政治因素、保证对资本主义工业顺利地进行社会主义改造的重要条件。
    不明确私营工厂中发展新党员工作必须围绕正确地贯彻党对资本主义工商业利用、限制、改造的政策和领导全体职工监督资本家搞好生产这个基本任务进行，并为这个基本任务服务。因而，在进行挑选、教育和考察积极分子的工作时，不是从上述基本任务着眼，围绕生产进行，而是偏重注意生活作风等等问题。
    在党内不断出现各种保守思想。开始有些同志对发展对象要求过高，认为必须“十全十美”，有“突出表现”等。对于有些实际上已够入党条件，但还有某些小缺点的人就不去发展。如车间大组长张宝囝，品质很好、工作负责，只是因为作风比较生硬，教育工人时不注意方式方法，因此，有的党员认为她“脾气躁”，就不想去发展（现已接收入党）。在发展一批新党员后，又出现了新的保守思想，如部分党员认为“差不多了”，可以“松松气”，有些总支和分支委员顾虑“摊子已经很大，再发展领导不了”等等。
    以上思想障碍，都曾严重地影响了发展新党员工作的开展。总支在发现这些情况后，除了在部署工作时进行教育、批判外，还经常通过党课和支部大会进行教育、批判，逐步打下了积极慎重发展新党员的思想基础。
    二、密切围绕正确地贯彻党对资本主义工商业利用、限制、改造的政策和领导全体职工监督资本家搞好生产的任务，进行积极分子的教育和考察工作。
    党组织对资方在生产的经营管理方面，是充分利用其积极的一面；而对他们在生产中只求数量、不重质量，在接受国营经济的领导中，发牢骚，讲怪话，以及助长职工经济主义倾向等方面，则经常地依靠工会和青年团的组织发动群众进行必要的斗争。通过这些实际的斗争，总支注意了教育和考察积极分子。教育的内容，就是要求他们正确地对待公私关系、劳资关系、国家与个人关系，防止与检举资本家施行“五毒”，监督资本家改善经营管理，改善劳动条件，保证国家委托的生产任务按时、按质地全面完成。通过反复的思想教育，再分配他们具体任务，从他们执行任务的情况中去考察他们的觉悟程度，然后将其中历史清楚、符合党员标准的人接收入党。
    一年来，庆丰二厂总支所接收的党员，大部分是经过这些教育和斗争考验的优秀分子。例如在整顿劳动纪律和克服经济主义倾向的斗争中，教育和启发积极分子树立国家主人翁的责任感，明确“生产第一”的思想，了解在私营工厂中领导全体职工监督资本家搞好生产，虽然对资本家有利，但首先是对工人阶级有利；明确经济主义倾向是资产阶级思想的反映，如果工人阶级存在这种思想倾向，就容易被资产阶级所腐蚀和分化，因此必须坚决克服这种倾向。许多积极分子经过反复的思想教育，都提高了觉悟，划清了思想界限，自动地批判自己过去在生产上的不负责任现象以及不自觉地帮助资本家施行“五毒”的行为。例如有的工人受资本家支使将次等品充上等品交给了国家，就“心里感到高兴”，以为“占了便宜”；如果被发觉罚了款，就跟着资本家发牢骚等等。在他们提高觉悟、提高认识的基础上，党组织分配他们任务，要他们积极向群众宣传党的政策，并以自己的模范行动来带动广大职工。品质检验组陈鼎言，经过教育后，提高了责任感，在检验中特别认真负责。一次，在一千二百多匹头等品中，就检查出一百多匹二三等品，甚至还有次货。皮辊车间赵品甫，当收到国家分配的原料品质稍差时，也不再“埋怨”和“发牢骚”了，而是主动地积极地想办法、改进技术，因而提高了皮辊质量，减少了断头率。由于他们在这些斗争中一贯立场明确，斗争坚决，并且本人历史清楚，因此，总支接收了他们入党。
    三、明确在技术工人和技术人员中进行发展党的工作的重要性，根据他们的思想特点，进行教育、考察工作。
    为了在私营工厂中顺利地贯彻党对资本主义工商业利用、限制、改造的政策和领导全体职工监督资本家搞好生产，党组织就必须掌握生产的每一环节，因此，发动技术工人和技术人员的工作就起着特别重大的甚至是决定性的作用；在技术工人和技术人员中间发展党员，就成为保证党掌握生产环节的重大措施。庆丰二厂的党组织最初在这方面是认识不足的，并存在着各种错误认识。如认为技术工人“人情世故深不容易接近”，“历史复杂无从了解”；对年纪大的老技工，则认为“也许活不了几年”，花时间去培养他们是“白费功夫”；认为技术人员“薪水拿得多，坐坐沙发，不起作用”，对于“技术人员同样是工人阶级的一部分”，有抵触情绪。党内的这些思想，严重地妨碍了在技术工人和技术人员中发展新党员的工作。同时，技术工人和技术人员对待入党问题也有许多顾虑和错误认识。如技术工人一般都认为自己“文化低”“不会讲话”，入党后“没有办法领导小组”，或者怕开会太多，影响生产和休息；技术人员一般是爱虚荣，好面子，不敢大胆暴露思想，他们怕申请后批不准丢面子，又怕过严格的组织生活，工作做不好要受批评，还有一定程度的看不起工人的情绪等等。
    总支根据这些思想情况，首先在党内进行教育，强调技术工人和技术人员在生产中的作用，批判各种不正确的认识，然后总支又在技术工人和技术人员中进行了以下各种工作：（一）吸收他们参加有关会议。当增产节约委员会、品质研究组、支部大会等讨论有关生产和技术问题时，都热忱地吸收他们参加，对他们进行政治思想教育，发挥他们的积极性、创造性，并重视他们的建议，使他们感到党对他们的爱护；当支部大会讨论技术工人和技术人员入党问题时，也吸收他们参加，启发他们联系自己，进行自我教育。（二）采用个别联系的教育方法。对技术工人一般运用新旧社会对比的实例进行教育，启发他们的阶级觉悟，使他们体验到党的光荣、伟大和正确。对技术人员则注意进行正面教育，对他们缺点的批评，多采取个别交谈的方式，使他们感到党的亲切和关怀。并且，注意挑选生产技术较好、在群众中有一定威信的党员或是支部的负责干部去联系他们，这样，工作开展就较顺利，效果较好。
    由于重视了在技术工人和技术人员中发展党员的工作，并取得了一些成绩，因此，进一步发挥了党组织领导全体职工监督资本家搞好生产的作用；同时，技术工人和某些技术人员在群众中有较高威信，参加党后，经过党的培养教育，都有了进步，能够团结群众，公开技术，积极钻研生产，因此，也就更进一步密切了党与群众的联系，提高了党组织的威信，更好地保证国家加工订货、收购任务的完成。
    四、加强对发展新党员工作的业务指导，培养和训练建党骨干，并有计划地安排接收新党员的时间。
    庆丰二厂党组织的特点是新党员多，他们对党的工作的业务知识都十分缺乏，因此，加强对建党工作的业务指导就十分重要。这一时期，采取了如下几项措施：第一，划定分批个别地接收新党员入党的时间（大体上是在每一阶段生产和其他运动的末尾或空隙时间），除个别例外外，一般都在规定时期办理入党手续。这样做的好处是有利于进行发展新党员工作的业务指导，领导上也易于安排支部活动的时间，不致将审查、接收新党员的会议时间被紧张的中心工作冲垮。第二，挑选一批建党骨干，减少他们其他方面的工作，让他们协助支部组织委员检查、督促、具体指导发展新党员的工作，并与发展对象进行谈话等。第三，采取上业务课（进行怎样正确掌握党员标准和办理入党手续等方面的教育）、开座谈会等办法，提高建党骨干和全体党员的建党业务水平。
    经验证明，在新党员多、发展新党员工作业务水平较低以及生产任务和其他中心工作紧张的情况下，采取有计划地按每个中心工作步骤来统一安排时间，分批个别地办理入党手续，并根据中心工作的特点和要求，明确对积极分子教育、考察的内容，这个办法是有效的。同时，还必须挑选适当数量的建党骨干和加强对他们的业务指导，这样，就能保证发展新党员工作密切围绕生产进行，并为生产服务；这样，才能保证发展新党员工作的计划顺利贯彻。
