Editorial: Implementing Unified Purchase and Sale of Cotton Cloth and Unified Purchase of Cotton

The State Council of the Central People's Government today promulgated two orders stipulating that, starting from September 15th, the planned purchase and planned supply of cotton cloth and the planned purchase of cotton will be implemented nationwide. This is an important measure to ensure the supply of cotton needed by the textile industry and people's livelihood, to ensure that cotton cloth can be produced and distributed according to national plans, and to further eliminate market speculation and stabilize prices. It is beneficial to the stability of people's lives and to the country's socialist construction. The people of the whole country should strive to implement the methods stipulated in these two orders.

Why is it necessary to implement this method now? This is because the growth rate of cotton and cotton cloth production cannot keep up with the growth rate of people's needs. This contradiction has become increasingly apparent since 1953.

In the past few years, China's cotton and cotton cloth production has developed greatly. If the total cotton output in 1949 is taken as 100, then it was 265 in 1953; if the total output of 1936, the highest production level before liberation, is taken as 100, then it was 139 in 1953. The national cotton cloth output in the textile industry in 1953 was approximately 243 times the highest annual output before liberation and 363 times that of 1949. Therefore, it fully met the social needs of previous years, and the current national cotton cloth inventory is still abundant. If we only consider today and do not calculate the future, then we are living well now. However, we must not do that; our government must make long-term plans for the people. Therefore, we must see the growth of cotton and cotton cloth production and consumption since 1953. Taking cotton cloth as an example, although the output in 1953 increased by 27 percent compared with 1952, the purchasing power of the broad masses of the people increased even faster, so that market sales during the same period increased by 47 percent (excluding military use). At this rate of growth, no matter how production develops, it cannot keep up with the needs, which creates a situation where the growth rate of production and consumption are not in harmony. This situation will inevitably continue to exist for a considerable period in the future, so measures must be taken in time to plan ahead.

People cannot fail to see that China started large-scale economic construction in 1953, investment increased, the number of employed people increased, and social purchasing power increased, and a large part of purchasing power was used to purchase means of livelihood. The national cotton cloth sales volume was only more than 50 million bolts in 1950, but it increased to 130 million bolts in 1953, which is a significant proof. In the future, with the development of national economic construction, social purchasing power will continue to grow. This is very natural, and it shows the general improvement of people's lives, which is precisely the benefit of the revolution. However, China's agriculture, which is currently dominated by small-scale peasant economy, is technically backward and has a low level. Therefore, cotton production cannot keep up with the needs of the textile industry. It is difficult to change the backwardness of agriculture before agriculture is completely collectivized and mechanized. This situation shows that a considerable period of time must pass before the contradiction between production and consumption can be fundamentally resolved. Today, we are unswervingly striving to realize the country's socialist industrialization, precisely in order to fundamentally solve this contradiction in the end.

Under the current conditions, the only way to solve the contradiction that the growth rate of cotton and cotton cloth production cannot keep up with the growth rate of needs is: the state should take charge of all cotton and cotton cloth, make overall plans, and implement planned purchases; at the same time, implement planned supply of cotton cloth, the state should appropriately control consumption, and implement reasonable distribution. There are many benefits to implementing the planned purchase and planned supply of cotton cloth and the planned purchase of cotton. First, since the state controls all sources of goods, it can reasonably and planfully adjust the cotton cloth consumption of the people across the country according to different regions, different climates and cloth-using habits, different levels of purchasing power, and the principle of appropriately increasing rural supply and reducing urban consumption, so that the cotton cloth needs of the people across the country can be appropriately met. The state expects to supply slightly higher level of cotton cloth this year than last year. So much cloth, planned distributed by the state, is fully capable of ensuring the basic needs of the people across the country, which is no lower than in previous years. Second, because the state plans to purchase cotton and private merchants are not allowed to purchase cotton in cotton-producing areas, cotton can no longer flow into the hands of private merchants, and cotton farmers can sell cotton to the state in a planned manner, so that the state can fully control the source of cotton, use it in a planned manner, guarantee the needs of the cotton textile industry and people's cotton wadding, and promote the planned production of the cotton textile industry and the indigenous yarn textile industry. Third, the state purchases cotton from cotton farmers at fair and reasonable prices, except for the cotton used for paying public grain and for their own use, which not only does not affect the needs of cotton farmers themselves, but also enables cotton farmers to develop production more freely, develop mutual assistance and cooperation, and accelerate the socialist transformation of agriculture. Fourth, due to the implementation of the above measures, market speculation can be further eliminated, the stability of prices can be consolidated, and the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce can be promoted.

In addition to implementing this method, can there be other methods? For example, expanding cotton fields, producing more cotton; or importing cotton, weaving more cotton cloth. These methods are obviously not feasible. In the past few years, China's cotton fields have been expanded a lot. In 1950, there were only more than 50 million mu, but in 1954, it has increased to more than 80 million mu. If cotton fields are excessively expanded in the future, it will inevitably reduce grain fields and reduce grain output, which is very unfavorable. As for importing a large amount of cotton, which takes up a lot of foreign exchange, it will reduce the import of industrial equipment and affect the entire country's industrialization cause. In addition, can we adopt the method of raising cloth prices to limit consumption, or allow free trading? Of course, this is also impossible. Adopting the former method will directly reduce the living standards of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and other working people; and allowing the development of the free market will lead to panic buying and hoarding, which will cause price fluctuations and promote the spontaneous forces of capitalism.

Therefore, the people of the whole country should recognize the important significance of the state's implementation of planned purchase and planned supply of cotton cloth and planned purchase of cotton today, and actively support this policy.

Textile workers should actively save raw cotton, increase labor productivity, increase output, improve quality, and reduce costs to supply the people across the country with more affordable and durable cotton cloth.

Cotton farmers should actively increase cotton production, improve production technology, steadily develop mutual assistance and cooperation, overcome the reluctance to sell, and strive to sell more cotton to the state at the prices and times stipulated by the state, and absolutely not sell cotton to private merchants.

Employees in the cotton cloth business should actively assist the government in undertaking the task of completing the socialist transformation of the cotton cloth business, urge and help capitalists accept socialist transformation, and oppose and stop capitalists from endangering public interests, disrupting social economic order, and undermining national economic plans.

Cotton cloth merchants should strictly abide by the government's policies and laws, obey the management of state administrative organs, the leadership of the state-owned economy, and the supervision of the working masses, actively improve their business, conscientiously accept socialist transformation, and strive to complete the business tasks entrusted by the state.

The people of the whole country should give play to the spirit of patriotism and save cotton and cotton cloth. In our country with a population of more than 600 million, saving one or two liang of cotton or one chi of cloth per person per year can accumulate into an amazing quantity.

Party committees and relevant government agencies at all levels must earnestly do a good job in propaganda and education and organizational work. Especially in rural areas, the unified purchase and sale of grain and oils and the further development of the mutual assistance and cooperation movement are also being carried out at the same time. These tasks are very complex and arduous, but they must be done well at the same time. Failure to complete any task or failure to complete it well will affect the people's lives and the country's construction, and affect the relationship between the Party and the government and the masses of the people. Only when we earnestly carry out propaganda and education work and organizational work, and mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people, can we victoriously and completely complete various major tasks.

### 实行棉布统购统销和棉花统购

    实行棉布统购统销和棉花统购
    中央人民政府政务院今天公布了两项命令，规定自九月十五日起，在全国范围内实行棉布的计划收购、计划供应和棉花的计划收购。这是为了保证纺织工业和人民生活所需要的棉花的供应，保证棉布能够按照国家的计划生产和分配，并进一步消灭市场投机和稳定物价的重要措施。它既有利于人民生活的安定，也有利于国家的社会主义建设。全国人民应该努力贯彻执行这两个命令所规定的办法。
    为什么目前必须实行这种办法呢？这是因为棉花和棉布生产增长的速度赶不上人民需要增长的速度。这个矛盾从一九五三年开始日益变得明显起来。
    过去几年来，我国棉花和棉布的生产都有很大发展。如果以一九四九年的棉花总产量为一○○，那么，一九五三年是二百六十五；如果以解放前最高生产水平的一九三六年的总产量为一○○，那么，一九五三年是一百三十九。一九五三年全国纺织工业中的棉布产量约等于解放前最高年产量的二百四十三，为一九四九年的三百六十三。因此，它充分满足了历年的社会需要，目前国家棉布库存也还充裕。如果只顾今天，不计算将来，那么，我们目前的日子还是很好过的。但是，我们决不能那样，我们的政府一定要为人民作长期打算。因此，我们不能不看到从一九五三年以来棉花、棉布生产和消费速度增长的情况。以棉布为例，一九五三年产量比一九五二年虽然增加了百分之二十七，可是广大人民群众对棉布的购买力却更快地增长起来，以致同一期间的市场销量竟增加了百分之四十七
  （不包括军用）。照这样的增长速度来看，无论生产怎样发展，也是赶不上需要的，这就造成了生产和消费增长速度不相适应的情况。今后在一个相当时期内这种情况必然继续存在，因此就必须及时采取措施，作“未雨绸缪”的打算。
    人们不能不看到，我国从一九五三年开始了大规模经济建设，投资增加，就业人数增加，社会购买力提高，购买力中很大部分又是用来添置生活资料的。一九五○年全国棉布销售量只有五千多万匹，一九五三年就增加到一亿三千万匹，这就是显著的证明。今后随着国家经济建设的发展，社会购买力还会继续增长。这是很自然的，它说明了人民生活的普遍提高，这正是革命的好处。但是我国目前占优势的是在小农经济基础之上的农业，技术落后，水平不高，因此，棉花的生产赶不上纺织工业的需要。要改变农业的落后情况，在农业没有完全合作化、机械化以前，那是很困难的事。这种情况说明，要根本解决生产和消费的矛盾必须经过一个相当长久的时期。我们今天坚定不移地为实现国家的社会主义工业化而努力，正是为了最终地根本解决这个矛盾。
    在目前的条件下，要解决棉花棉布生产增长的速度赶不上需要增长的速度这一矛盾的办法只能是：由国家把棉花棉布全部掌握起来，统筹统支，实行计划收购；同时实行棉布的计划供应，由国家适当控制消费，实行合理的分配。实行棉布计划收购、计划供应和棉花计划收购的好处很多。第一，由于国家掌握了全部货源，就可以根据不同地区、不同气候和用布习惯，不同的购买力水平，以及适当增加农村供应和少增城市消费的原则，合理地有计划地调剂全国人民的棉布消费，使全国人民对棉布的需要都能得到适当的满足。国家今年预计供应的棉布，还略高于去年的水平。这样多的布，由国家加以有计划的分配，是完全能保证全国人民基本的需要，并不低于往年的水平。第二，由于棉花由国家计划收购，不准私商到棉区收购棉花，棉花就可以不再流入私商手中，棉农就可以有计划地把棉花卖给国家，就可以使国家充分地掌握棉花来源，有计划地使用，保障棉纺织工业和人民絮棉的需要，促进棉纺织工业、土纱纺织业有计划的生产。第三，国家用公平合理的价格，收购棉农除缴纳公粮和自用棉以外的棉花，既不影响棉农自己的需要，又可以使棉农更加放手发展生产，发展互助合作，加速农业的社会主义改造。第四，由于实行了以上措施，就可以进一步消灭市场投机行为，巩固物价的稳定，并促进对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。
    除了实行这个办法以外，还能不能有其它的办法呢？譬如扩大棉田、多产棉花；或者进口棉花，多织棉布。这些办法显然是不行的。过去几年，我国棉田已扩大不少，一九五○年只五千多万亩，一九五四年已增到八千多万亩，今后如果过分扩大棉田，就势必会缩小粮田，减少粮食产量，这是很不利的。至于大量输入棉花，占去很多外汇，就会缩减工业器材的入口，影响整个国家工业化的事业。此外，是不是可以采用提高布价的办法来限制消费，或者听任自由买卖呢？当然，这也是不行的。采用前一办法，就会直接降低广大工人、农民和其它劳动人民的生活水平；而听任自由市场的发展，就会发生抢购和囤积的现象，就会引起物价的波动，就会助长资本主义的自发势力。
    因此，全国人民都应该认识国家今天实行棉布计划收购、计划供应和棉花计划收购的重要意义，积极拥护这个政策。
    纺织工人们，应该积极地节约原棉，提高劳动生产率，增加产量，提高品质，降低成本，供应全国人民更多的价廉耐用的棉布。
    棉农们，应该积极增产棉花，提高生产技术，稳步发展互助合作，克服惜售思想，争取把更多的棉花按照国家规定的价格和时间卖给国家，绝对不把棉花卖给私商。
    棉布商业中的职工们，应该积极协助政府，担负起完成棉布商业社会主义改造的任务，督促和帮助资本家接受社会主义改造，反对和制止资本家危害公共利益、扰乱社会经济秩序、破坏国家经济计划的行为。
    棉布商人应该严格遵守政府的政策法令，服从国家行政机关的管理、国营经济的领导和工人群众的监督，积极改进经营，认真接受社会主义改造，努力完成国家委托的经营任务。
    全国人民都应该发挥爱国主义的精神，节约棉花和棉布。在六亿以上人口的我国，每人每年节约一两棉花或一尺布，就可以集成一个惊人的数量。
    各级党委和政府有关机关必须认真做好宣传教育工作和组织工作。特别在农村中，同时还进行着粮食、油脂的统购统销和进一步发展互助合作运动，这些工作都是十分复杂而艰巨的，但又必须同时做好，任何一项任务不能完成，或完成得不好，都将影响到人民的生活和国家的建设，影响到党和政府与人民群众的关系。只有我们认真地进行了宣传教育工作和组织工作，发动了广大人民群众的积极性，才能胜利地、完满地完成各项重大的任务。
