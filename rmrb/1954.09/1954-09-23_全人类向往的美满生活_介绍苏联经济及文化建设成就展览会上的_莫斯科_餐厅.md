The Beautiful Life That All Humanity Aspires To
——Introducing the "Moscow" Restaurant at the Exhibition of Achievements in Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction
By our reporter Shen Wenying

The "Moscow" Restaurant also occupies an important position in the upcoming Exhibition of Achievements in Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction.

From the central hall of the palatial Soviet Exhibition Hall, heading west past the Agriculture Hall and the Food Industry Hall, and then north, you can enter the uniquely styled "Moscow" Restaurant. The harmonious colors and luxurious decorations of the restaurant attract every visitor.

Elegant Restaurant and Café

Stepping through the doors of the "Moscow" Restaurant, your eyes are immediately drawn to the vibrant red carpet and three bronze chandeliers. To the left is the cloakroom, and to the right is the lounge, furnished with soft leather sofas. Crossing the white jade steps, the five large golden characters of "Moscow Restaurant" face you on the opposite wall. On either side are the men's and women's restrooms. Inside, there are clothing and shoe brushes, as well as cosmetics such as perfume and hair oil. The women's restroom also has face powder. Guests can rest for a moment before dining, then freshen up and dress before happily entering the main dining hall.

The "Moscow" Restaurant is divided into two parts: the main dining hall in the front, which can accommodate 250 people and is equipped with air conditioning; and a smaller banquet hall behind the main dining hall. A huge oil painting of the Kremlin hangs on the north wall of the main dining hall, and in front of the painting is a green fountain, the murmuring sound of the water giving a sense of serenity and lightness. The four walls of the restaurant are made of light green marble with delicate patterns; bright, large glass windows are draped with white chiffon and silver-gray velvet curtains. The ceiling of the restaurant is decorated with plaster flowers made of pine branches, pine cones, and snowflakes. The four pillars in the middle of the hall are covered with lively and endearing birds and beasts made of copper pieces. The restaurant is furnished with clean tables, and on the snow-white linen tablecloths are placed various exquisite glasses, vases, and plates. The pure white napkins are placed on custom-made Jingdezhen porcelain plates in the Soviet style; the exquisite tableware is already arranged. A music stage is set up at the southern end of the restaurant, where a band will play music, allowing guests to happily dance and dine at the same time. The small banquet hall can accommodate about fifty people, with two large silver chandeliers hanging in the middle. Under the brilliant lights at night, it is like entering a crystal palace in a fairy tale. Here, long tables are covered with pure white tablecloths, spacious large chairs are placed around, and exquisite tableware is displayed, quietly awaiting the arrival of distinguished guests.

In the northwest part of the restaurant is a café, with deep red walls painted with patterns in the Ukrainian style. It is furnished with light rattan tables and chairs, and exquisite coffee cups and dessert plates are placed on them. People can drink rich coffee, eat delicious desserts, and enjoy the scenery of the western suburban park.

Electrified Kitchen

Behind the "Moscow" Restaurant, the kitchen has seven large electric refrigerators, which are respectively installed in the meat and fish processing room, the hot and cold dish room, the dessert distribution room, and the wine cabinet room, to store a sufficient quantity of food to receive guests. In the hot dish room, there are two large electric stoves for cooking, baking, or warming dishes; there are also two electric deep fryers and two electric stoves for boiling soup and coffee. In the pastry baking room, there are three large electric ovens for baking various pastries. Switches and current regulators are installed next to the electric stoves and ovens, so that chefs and pastry chefs can control the current according to the needs of heat, just like operating machine production. A ventilation hood is installed above the electric stoves to extract the hot air from cooking at any time. There is no smoke or coal ash in the kitchen, which can be kept clean at all times. Even in the hot summer, the chefs will not feel the heat. In addition, the two potato peeling machines in the vegetable processing room, the meat cutting and mincing machines in the meat and fish processing room, and the dishwashing machines in the dishwashing room can peel a large number of potatoes, cut or mince a large amount of meat and fish, and wash a large number of dishes in a relatively short time. Each floor of the kitchen is equipped with an electric conveyor, which can quickly and promptly send out desserts and various dishes.

Pay Attention to the Nutritional Value and Appearance of Food

The working comrades of the "Moscow" Restaurant Management Office have learned a lot of cooking knowledge under the guidance of the fifteen comrades of the Restaurant Soviet Expert Working Group. Some of them come from Harbin, Dalian, and Shenyang; some come from Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Tianjin. Although they have one or two decades of cooking experience, they have never learned scientific cooking knowledge. After this study, they realized that the work of a chef is also important. In the Soviet Union, the work of a chef is considered one of the most honorable and respected professions. With the direct help of experts, they have learned more than 170 kinds of Soviet soup and vegetable cooking methods. In the past, they believed that the side dishes and the appearance of the dishes were not the main content of cooking, but Soviet experts emphasized the importance of side dishes to the nutritional value. For example, meat is high in fat, so it should be served with cabbage and tomatoes that can help digestion. Fish is rich in phosphorus and protein, so it should be served with potatoes rich in starch and onions that can remove the fishy smell. Not only that, but attention must also be paid to the appearance of the dishes in order to stimulate people's appetite. For example, garnish ham slices with tender green lettuce leaves and peas, and dark green cucumber slices, and cut tomatoes into beautiful flowers; decorate the leg bones of fried chicken legs with pure white paper flowers, etc. Soviet experts also require every chef to pay attention to hygiene, take frequent showers, get haircuts, trim nails, and wear work clothes before starting work. At the beginning and end of work, the cleanliness of the cookware must be checked.

Good Service Attitude

The Soviet people are known for their hospitality. They require that every guest feel warm and considerate from the moment they enter the door until they leave the restaurant, as if returning to a long-lost home. Now, the restaurant's more than fifty waiters and waitresses from all over the country are learning this thoughtful and polite service attitude of the Soviet people. They are beginning to realize that waiters should always allow guests to dine quietly and comfortably; they should be familiar with the daily menu, understand the preparation methods, nutritional value, and prices of various dishes, so as to answer guests' inquiries in detail. After the guests are seated, the menu must be given to the women first, which shows respect for women. In addition, they must be familiar with the psychology of each guest. Dishes should be served to children first, because children are the most impatient; and then to the elderly, which shows respect for the elderly. Waiters are required to stand next to the worktable, not watching the guests eat, and not listening to the guests speak, so as not to restrict the guests during the meal; they should always take care of each guest and serve the dishes in a timely manner so that the temperature of the dishes is appropriate. This fully demonstrates that every waiter and waitress in the Soviet Union has a high level of cultural education.

    全人类向往的美满生活
    ——介绍苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会上的“莫斯科”餐厅
    本报记者　沈文英
    “莫斯科”餐厅在即将开幕的苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会上，同样占着重要的位置。
    从宫殿式的苏联展览馆中央大厅往西，经过农业馆、食品工业馆，再向北走，就可以进入别具风格的“莫斯科”餐厅。餐厅的色彩调和、布置富丽，吸引着每一个参观者。
    雅致的餐厅和咖啡厅
    走进“莫斯科”餐厅的大门，鲜艳美丽的大红色地毯和三盏古铜色的吊灯，吸住了人们的视线。左侧是衣帽间，右侧是休息室，里边布置着柔软的皮沙发。往里跨上白玉石阶，对面墙上是“莫斯科餐厅”五个大金字。两侧是男女盥洗室。室内备有衣、鞋刷子和香水、头油等化妆品，女盥洗室内还有香粉。客人可以在进餐前少憩片刻，再进行盥洗、整装，然后愉快地步入大餐厅。
      “莫斯科”餐厅分为两部分：前面是可容二百五十人进餐的大餐厅，装有冷气设备；大餐厅后面设有小型的宴会厅。大餐厅北墙上挂着巨幅的克里姆林宫油画，大油画前面有绿色的喷水泉，潺潺的流水声，给人以清静、轻快的感觉。餐厅的四壁是嫩绿色的大理石，上面有细腻花纹；明亮的大玻璃长窗上，垂着白色乔其纱和银灰色天鹅绒的窗帘。餐厅顶上是松枝、松果和雪花组成的石膏花饰。厅中间四根柱子上，包着生气勃勃、逗人喜爱的用铜片攒成的鸟、兽。餐厅内安置着整洁的桌子，在雪白的亚麻桌布上摆着各式精制的玻璃杯、花瓶和盘子；洁白的餐巾，放在仿造苏联式特制的景德镇瓷盘上；精美的餐具已安排妥当。餐厅南面上端设有乐台，将有乐队伴奏，客人可以愉快地一边跳舞一边进餐。小型宴会厅约可容纳五十来人，中间垂着两盏银色的大吊灯。在夜间辉煌的灯光下，如入神话中的水晶宫一般。这儿长桌上铺着洁白的桌布，放着宽敞的大椅子，陈列着精制的餐具，静待着贵宾的来临。
    餐厅的西北部设有咖啡厅，深红色的墙壁上，描绘着具有乌克兰色彩的花纹，这里安排着轻便的藤桌和藤椅，摆着讲究的咖啡杯和点心盘。人们可以在此喝着浓郁的咖啡，吃着可口的点心，眺望西郊公园内的景色。
    电气化的厨房
    “莫斯科”餐厅后面的厨房内有七个大型的电气冰箱，分别安设在肉鱼加工间，热、冷菜间，点心分送间和酒柜间内，用以储备足够数量的食品以接待客人们。在热菜间内设有大型的电灶二座，用以烹饪、焙烤或暖菜；还有二座电气炸油炉和煮汤煮咖啡的两只电炉。烤点心间内有三架大型电烤炉，用以焙烤各种点心。电灶电炉旁都设有开关和电流调度器，厨师和点心师们可以如同掌握机器生产一样，根据需要热力的情况掌握电流。电灶上端设有抽风筒，随时抽出室内炒菜的热气。厨房里没有烟薰和煤灰，可经常保持清洁，即使在炎热的夏天，厨师们也不会感到热气袭人。此外，蔬菜加工间的两架马铃薯削皮机、肉鱼加工间的切肉、搅肉机，以及餐具洗涤室内的盆碟洗涤器，都能在较短的时间内削好大量的马铃薯、切好或搅好大量的肉鱼和洗净大批的盆碟。厨房的每层设有电动运送机，它可以迅速及时地把点心和各种菜肴送出去。
    注意食品的营养价值和外观
    莫斯科餐厅管理处的工作同志们，在餐厅苏联专家工作组的十五位同志的指导下，学到了很多烹饪知识。他们有的来自哈尔滨、大连、沈阳；有的来自上海、广州、天津。他们虽有一二十年的烹饪工作历史，但从没有学习过科学的烹饪知识。经过这次学习，他们认识到厨师工作同样是重要的。在苏联，厨师工作被认为是最荣誉和最受人尊敬的职业之一。在专家的直接帮助下，他们已学会了一百七十多种苏联汤菜的烹饪法。过去，他们认为配菜和菜肴的外观不是烹饪的主要内容，可是苏联专家却十分强调配菜对营养价值的重要性。如肉类的脂肪多，要配上能帮助消化的洋白菜和蕃茄。鱼富有磷和蛋白质，要配上含有丰富的淀粉的马铃薯和解腥的洋葱。不仅如此，还要注意菜肴的外观，以刺激人们的食欲。如在火腿片旁配上嫩绿的生菜叶、豌豆，深绿的黄瓜片，把蕃茄切成美丽的花朵；在炸鸡腿的腿骨上装着洁白的纸花等。苏联专家还要求每个厨师注意卫生，经常洗澡、理发，修剪指甲，穿戴好工作服，然后进行工作。在工作开始和结束时，必须检查炊具的整洁。
    良好的服务态度
    苏联人民向以好客闻名的，他们要求使每个客人从走进门到离开餐厅，一直感到温暖、体贴，如同回到久别的家一样。现在，餐厅的五十多个来自全国各地的招待员，正在学习苏联人民这种周到的有礼貌的服务态度。他们开始认识到招待员应时刻让客人安静而舒适地进餐；要熟悉每日的菜单，了解各种菜肴的作法、营养价值和菜肴的价格，以便详细地解答客人的询问。在客人就座后，菜单必须先送给妇女，这表示对妇女的尊重。此外，还要熟悉每个客人的心理，上菜要先给孩子，因为孩子最性急；然后再给老人、这表示对老人的尊敬。招待员要求自己站在工作台旁，不望着客人吃，不听客人说话，以免客人进餐时受拘束；时刻关照每个客人，及时上菜，使菜肴的温度适当。这充分说明苏联的每个招待人员，都具有高度的文化教养。
