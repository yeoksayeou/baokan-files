Actively Develop Rural Credit Cooperatives

In the process of gradually implementing the socialist transformation of agriculture, establishing and developing rural credit cooperatives is an indispensable and important component of the cooperative movement. The "Resolution on the Development of Agricultural Production Cooperatives" of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China once pointed out: "Agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation, rural supply and marketing cooperation, and rural credit cooperation are the three forms of rural cooperativization. These three types of cooperation have division of labor while being interconnected and mutually promoting, thereby gradually linking rural economic activities with the country's economic construction plan, and gradually transforming the small-scale peasant economy on the basis of production cooperation." This specifically defines the position and role of credit cooperation.

Since the liberation of the whole country, rural credit cooperatives have increased year by year. According to statistics at the end of 1953, there were more than 9,400 credit cooperatives across the country, with nearly 6 million members, as well as more than 2,000 credit departments attached to supply and marketing cooperatives and a large number of credit mutual aid groups, with a total share capital of more than 120 billion yuan, accumulated deposits of more than 740 billion yuan, and loans issued of more than 770 billion yuan. Especially in the winter of 1953, after the publicity and education of the general line of the transition period was carried out in rural areas across the country, credit cooperative organizations have developed further with the improvement of farmers' socialist awareness. As of mid-February this year, the North China region had established more than 1,400 credit cooperatives, the Northeast region increased by more than 600 in the first quarter of this year, East China increased by 1,600 in the first four months of this year, the Central South region increased by 3.5 times, and the Southwest region also increased slightly. Credit cooperatives and credit departments are all part of the socialist financial system under the leadership of the state-owned economy. They are cooperative economies of the working people, without the participation of exploiters, the funds are controlled by all members, and the surplus is owned by all members. They conduct business activities in accordance with national financial policies, and use low-interest loans to help members and farmers develop production and promote the development of mutual aid and cooperation in accordance with socialist principles, and combat the exploitation of usury, so they are all socialist economic organizations. The result of the development of this economic component is that it has effectively squeezed out the influence of the rural capitalist economy, and the activities of usury exploitation and pursuing commercial speculative profits have been hit to a certain extent and greatly reduced. Undoubtedly, this is beneficial to the peasants and also beneficial to the country's socialist construction.

However, compared with the overall requirements of the socialist transformation of agriculture, the socialist economic front in rural areas is still very small, and capitalist spontaneous forces still have a deep economic foundation. Expressed in rural financial issues, on the one hand, due to the restoration and development of the agricultural economy in recent years, a considerable number of farmers have surplus money and grain, and the large amount of funds invested by the state in the unified purchase are also controlled by small-scale peasant farmers, becoming a considerable amount of floating capital in rural areas. On the other hand, because farmers' harvests have a certain season, production investment and living expenses are often temporarily difficult to turn around and require loans; there are also a considerable number of poor farmers who lack production funds or encounter difficulties in life and must borrow from others. These two aspects constitute the basis for rural usurers and capitalist spontaneous forces to engage in usury activities. The result of usury activities will affect farmers' production enthusiasm, disintegrate the enthusiasm for mutual aid and cooperation, a small number of people become rich without labor, and an increasing number of farmers fall into poverty and bankruptcy, which will lead to a new differentiation of classes in rural areas. For example, Lin Tiandian, a poor peasant in Longmen Township, Changle County, Fujian Province, saw the benefits of usury and lent eight dan of rice at high interest, and partnered with a private merchant to do business, with no intention of production at all. Of the 33 mutual aid groups in the township, 31 lent usury to farmers inside and outside the group or were exploited by usurers outside the group, resulting in low production enthusiasm in many mutual aid groups, and even collapse. According to a survey in Rongdang Village in the township, of the 31 households that sold land after the autumn harvest of 1952 and before the spring plowing of 1953, 13 households sold land to repay usury, of which 43 percent of the land was sold to 12 middle-peasant households. These situations are of course very unfavorable to the development of the rural economy.

It can be seen that to solve the rural financial problem, it is necessary to actively develop credit cooperatives. Once this kind of organization is universally established and spreads a huge credit network in counties and townships, and when these credit organizations are truly well-run, they will be able to absorb a large amount of rural idle funds to meet the increasing capital needs in the process of agricultural development. This is an important source of gathering agricultural production funds in addition to state financial assistance. It can truly help farmers solve difficulties and promote the development of agricultural production, sideline production, and handicraft production. It will also be able to more effectively combat usury activities, restrict the development of capitalist spontaneous forces in rural areas, and promote the development of agricultural production and mutual aid and cooperation. All areas with successful credit cooperation have proven its great role for the country and farmers. The loans issued by credit cooperatives in the North China region during this year's spring plowing and production accounted for more than 41 percent of the loans from state banks during the same period; the loans issued by credit cooperatives in Yuncheng Prefecture, Shanxi Province from the beginning of spring plowing to the end of March were equal to 152 percent of the number of agricultural loans issued by state banks in this prefecture during the same period. The Luoxi Township Credit Cooperative in Panyu County, Guangdong Province, had a savings balance of more than 990 million yuan by the end of August 1953. In addition to meeting the loan needs of its members, it also transferred more than 830 million yuan to state banks. In Yuebei Village, Pingyao County, Shanxi Province, more than 100 households borrowed usury with interest rates of around 10 percent in 1950. In 1951, a credit cooperative was established, and in 1952, all usury activities were eliminated. The examples given above are sufficient to illustrate the remarkable superiority of credit cooperatives.

Now it is necessary to actively develop rural credit cooperation. Generally speaking, in areas where this movement already has a certain foundation and the leadership has gained certain experience, the focus should be on vigorously developing credit cooperatives. In areas where the credit cooperation movement still lacks the necessary experience, but production mutual aid and cooperation and supply and marketing cooperation are developing better, they should be good at using their influence to actively develop credit cooperatives or credit mutual aid groups, and credit departments can be attached to supply and marketing cooperatives or production cooperatives as a transitional form. In areas where the credit cooperation foundation is weak, and production cooperation and supply and marketing cooperation are also relatively poor, the original forms of mutual assistance of funds among farmers should be actively utilized while developing production and supply and marketing cooperation, to develop credit mutual aid groups and try to run credit cooperatives. However, in any case, we must recognize that credit cooperation is different from agricultural production cooperation, and credit cooperation is relatively simple and easy to handle. Therefore, we cannot mechanically apply the general development law of the production cooperation movement from groups to cooperatives, but should adopt different organizational forms according to the needs of local rural financial circulation, the voluntary participation of the masses, and the specific circumstances of the development of the credit cooperation movement. Their development speed should also be faster than production and supply and marketing cooperation.

Of course, this does not mean that we can relax our leadership over credit cooperation. Party committees and rural work departments of governments at all levels should attach importance to this work, grasp the leadership of this work, and ensure the healthy development of the credit cooperation movement, just like they treat other aspects of the cooperative movement. This requires adhering to the principle of voluntariness and opposing coercion and commandism. It is necessary to maintain the purity of the composition of credit cooperatives. It is limited to the participation of poor peasants, middle peasants, and other rural working people, and provides various conveniences to poor farmers, and refuses the participation of exploiting elements such as landlords, rich peasants, and merchants, but can absorb their deposits. We must actively develop savings deposits and loan business, strive to absorb rural idle funds, support the development of production and mutual aid and cooperation movements, and solve the legitimate living needs of poor farmers. It is necessary to correctly grasp the interest rate policy and improve the democratic management system; it is necessary to fight against rural usury until the final elimination of usury. As long as the above problems are handled well, credit cooperatives, like other cooperative organizations, can economically support mass production, politically unite and educate farmers, more effectively restrict the development of capitalist spontaneous forces in rural areas, and promote the country's socialist transformation of agriculture.

### 积极发展农村信用合作

    积极发展农村信用合作
    在逐步实行农业社会主义改造的过程中，建立和发展农村信用合作组织，是合作化运动不可缺少的一个重要组成部分。中共中央“关于发展农业生产合作社的决议”中曾经指出：“农业生产互助合作、农村供销合作和农村信用合作是农村合作化的三种形式。这三种合作互相分工而又互相联系和互相促进，从而逐步地把农村的经济活动与国家的经济建设计划联结起来，逐步地在生产合作的基础上，改造小农经济。”这就具体地规定了信用合作的地位和作用。
    全国解放以来，农村信用合作组织逐年都有增加。根据一九五三年底的统计，全国已有信用合作社九千四百多个，社员近六百万人，还有二千多个附设在供销合作社内的信用部和大量的信用互助组，共有股金一千二百多亿元，吸收存款累计达七千四百多亿元，发放贷款七千七百多亿元。特别是一九五三年冬季，在全国农村中进行了过渡时期总路线的宣传教育以后，信用合作组织随着农民社会主义觉悟的提高更有了新的发展。华北区到今年二月中旬已建立了信用合作社一千四百多个，东北区今年第一季度增加六百多个，华东在今年头四个月增加一千六百个，中南区增加三点五倍，西南区也略有增加。信用合作社和信用部，都是在国营经济领导下的社会主义金融体系的一部分。它们是劳动人民的合作经济，没有剥削者参加，资金由全体社员支配，盈余为全体社员公有。它们根据国家金融政策进行业务活动，按照社会主义原则以低利贷款扶助社员和农民发展生产，扶助互助合作的发展，打击高利贷的剥削，所以它们都是社会主义性质的经济组织。这种经济成分发展的结果，就有力地排挤了农村资本主义经济的影响，使高利贷剥削和追逐商业投机利润的行为受到一定程度的打击而大见缩减。无疑的，这是有利于农民也有利于国家社会主义建设事业的。
    但是，比之农业社会主义改造的全部要求来说，农村社会主义的经济阵地目前毕竟还是很小的，资本主义自发势力还有深厚的经济基础。表现在农村金融问题上，一方面由于几年来农业经济的恢复和发展，相当一部分农民有了余钱余粮，国家实行统购所投放的大批资金又为小生产的农民所掌握，成为农村中一笔相当数量的游资。另一方面，由于农民的收获有一定季节，生产投资和生活开支常常一时周转不灵而需要借贷；也还有相当数量的贫困农民缺乏生产资金或遇到生活上的困难，必须向他人借贷。这两方面的情况，就构成农村高利贷者和资本主义自发势力向高利贷方面活动的基础。而高利贷活动的结果，就会影响农民的生产情绪，涣散互助合作的积极性，少数人不劳而暴富，日益增多的农民则陷于贫困和破产的境地，这就会造成农村阶级的新的分化。例如，福建长乐县龙门乡贫农林天殿，看到高利贷有利，就放了八担谷子的高利贷，又和一家私商合伙做生意，根本无心生产。该乡三十三个互助组，就有三十一个向组内外农民放高利贷或受组外高利贷者的剥削，结果很多互助组生产积极性不高，甚至因此垮台。又据该乡榕壋村的调查，一九五二年秋收后至一九五三年春耕前，三十一户出卖土地的农民，就有十三户是为了还高利贷，其中百分之四十三的土地，卖给了十二户中农。这些情况，对农村经济的发展当然是十分不利的。
    由此可见，要解决农村金融问题，必须积极发展信用合作组织。这种组织一旦普遍建立起来，在各县各乡撒开一个巨大的信贷网，而且这些信贷组织真正办好的时候，它就能够大量地吸收农村闲散资金，以适应农业发展过程中日益增长的资金需要。这是国家财政援助以外集聚农业生产资金的重要来源。它能够真正帮助农民解决困难，促进农业生产和副业、手工业生产的发展。也就能够更有力地打击高利贷活动，限制农村资本主义自发势力的发展，促进农业生产和互助合作的发展。凡是信用合作事业有成绩的地区，都证明了它对国家和农民的巨大作用。华北区信用合作组织在今年春耕生产中发出的贷款，相当于同期国家银行贷款百分之四十一以上；山西运城专区信用合作组织从春耕开始到三月底止发出的贷款，等于同期国家银行在这个专区发放农业贷款数的百分之一百五十二。广东番禺县萝西乡信用合作社，到一九五三年八月底止，储蓄余额达九亿又九千多万元，除满足社员贷款外，还转存国家银行八亿又三千多万元。山西省平遥县岳北村，一九五○年有一百多户农民借高利贷，利息十分左右，一九五一年成立了信用合作社，一九五二年就全部消灭了高利贷活动。我们举出这一些例子，已经可以说明信用合作组织的显著的优越性了。
    现在必须积极发展农村的信用合作。一般说来，在这一运动已有一定基础、领导上已取得一定经验的地区，应以大力发展信用合作社为主。在信用合作运动还缺乏必要经验，而生产互助合作和供销合作发展较好的地区，应善于利用它们的影响，积极发展信用合作社或信用互助组，并可在供销合作社或生产合作社内附设信用部，做为一种过渡的形式。在信用合作基础薄弱，而生产合作和供销合作也比较差的地区，则应与发展生产和供销合作的同时，积极利用农民原有的资金互助形式，发展信用互助组，并试办信用合作社。但是，无论是那一种情况，我们都必须认识，信用合作不同于农业生产合作，信用合作是比较单纯易办的，因此不能机械搬用生产合作运动由组到社的一般发展规律，而应根据当地农村金融流转的需要，群众的自愿和信用合作运动发展的具体情况，分别采用不同的组织形式。它们的发展速度也应比生产供销合作快一些。
    当然，这绝不是说我们就可以放松对信用合作的领导。各级党委及政府农村工作部门，应该如同对待其它方面的合作化运动一样，重视这项工作，抓紧领导这项工作，保证信用合作运动能够健康地发展。这就要坚持自愿原则，反对强迫命令。要保持信用合作组织成分的纯洁。它只限于贫农、中农和农村的其他劳动人民参加，并给贫困农民以各种便利，拒绝地主、富农和商人等剥削分子参加，但可以吸收他们的存款。我们要积极开展储蓄存款和放款业务，努力吸收农村游资，扶植生产和互助合作运动的发展，解决贫困农民正当的生活需要。要正确掌握利息政策和健全民主管理制度；要和农村高利贷行为做斗争，直到最后消灭高利贷。只要以上这些问题处理得好，就可以使信用合作组织和其它合作组织一样，在经济上支持群众生产、在政治上团结教育农民，更有效地限制农村资本主义自发势力的发展，推进国家对农业的社会主义改造。
