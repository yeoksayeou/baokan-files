    A Floating Bridge
    Zhou Shoujin
    At the foot of Zhi Mountain in Linpu Town, Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province, there is a brand-new floating bridge more than 100 meters long, spanning the rolling Puyang River. Pedestrians on the bridge are constantly coming and going: farmers from the south of the bridge carry grass paper, handmade paper and other local products to the market; those going to the south of the bridge are mostly happy people holding towels, fabrics, means of production and other daily necessities.
    By chance, I met an old woman in Zhangjiaban Village. She is a family member of a railway worker, a member of an agricultural production cooperative, and the villagers call her "Granny Fanzhong". She talked to me about this bridge. She said: "Speaking of this bridge, our people here really have to thank Chairman Mao. In the past, alas, it was really a sin! There was no bridge on the river, and going back and forth relied on ferries. The water was rapid at the ferry crossing here, and accidents would happen if you weren't careful. Hua Hai's daughter from Sanlian Village died because she fell into the river while taking the ferry. Without a bridge, going back and forth was so inconvenient. Who here didn't hope that one day a bridge would be built here!"
    It turned out that Linpu Town on the north bank of the Puyang River was an important town in Xiaoshan County. It borders the Puyang River to the south and the Linpu Station of the Zhe-Gan Railway to the east, promoting the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas in Xiaoshan, like a bond. Sometimes, even farmers from Fuyang and Pujiang would transport their local products to Linpu Town for distribution. But in the past, the only means of crossing the river here were a few dilapidated small wooden boats, and accidents often happened. How much the farmers hoped that a bridge could be built over the river, even the simplest one! But for many years, the local people were never able to realize this wish. A legend once circulated among the farmers: countless years ago, perhaps in the hands of the grandfather of an old man who is now fifty or sixty years old, a temple manager was determined to build a bridge over the Puyang River here. So he carried a large wooden fish on his back and went around begging for alms. After a long time, the temple manager collected a lot of money. But unfortunately, he died before he could complete his cause. The money was also embezzled. So the bridge building turned into a bubble again. But the people's desire to build a bridge quickly became a reality in the era when the people were their own masters.
    In the second half of 1953, the various townships in this area elected representatives to the township people's congress through universal suffrage. The farmers told the people's representatives their requests and opinions, asking them to reflect their opinions to the county. Naturally, everyone would not forget to bring up the matter of building a bridge.
    This proposal, which was related to the vital interests of the broad masses of the people, immediately attracted the attention of the Second Xiaoshan County Third People's Congress. The meeting discussed the proposal in detail and put forward a proposal to the Xiaoshan County People's Government to build a bridge. The Xiaoshan County People's Government considered that this was a problem that the local people urgently needed to solve, and after reporting it to the Provincial People's Government for approval, it decided to break ground on October 1.
    The news that a bridge was going to be built immediately spread throughout the county, and the people were overjoyed. Some said, "There is really such a good thing in the world, the people make suggestions, and the People's Government comes to build the bridge." An old man named Guan Fa, who was ill at the time, was so anxious when he heard the news that the bridge was going to be built that he said to his son, "Oh, I have been looking forward to a floating bridge all my life. Now the People's Government is building it. Let me walk across it, and I will die without regret!"
    In less than two months, the floating bridge was built. Every day, thousands of people pass through here. At the end of last year, the Linpu Town Material Exchange Conference originally planned to make transactions of about 200 million yuan, but the result was that the transaction volume increased to 600 million yuan, which shows that the construction of the floating bridge has a major relationship to strengthening the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas.
    After the floating bridge was built, the local people further realized the significance of the people being their own masters. As Kong Guan'gen, the director of the Punan Township Agricultural Production Cooperative, a county people's representative, and a member of the floating bridge construction committee, said: "We proposed the bridge building, and we built the bridge ourselves. Every time I walk across this bridge, I think that in our country, all power belongs to the people. ..."
    Yes, "All power in the People's Republic of China belongs to the people." This is a sentence clearly stipulated in the draft constitution, and it is also a characteristic of our country.

    一座浮桥
    周守瑾
    在浙江省萧山县临浦镇峙山山脚下，有一座一百多公尺长的崭新的浮桥，横跨在滚滚的浦阳江上。桥上行人络绎不绝：从桥南来的农民，挑着草纸、土纸等土特产去赶集；往桥南去的，多是些拿着毛巾、布匹、生产资料和其他日用品的兴高采烈的人们。
    偶然，我在张家坂村遇到一位老太婆。她是一个铁路工人的家属、农业生产合作社的社员，村里群众管她叫做“繁忠老妈”。她对我谈起这座桥。她说：“说起这座桥呀，我们这里的老百姓真要谢谢毛主席。在过去，唉，真罪过呀！江上没有桥，来来去去靠摆渡，这里的渡口水势急，一不小心就要出险，三联村华海的阿囡就是因为摆渡时翻在江里死的。没有桥，来来去去多不方便，这里的人哪个不盼望有一天在这里造起座桥！”
    原来浦阳江北岸的临浦镇是萧山县的一个重要城镇，它南沿浦阳江，东靠浙赣铁路的临浦站，像纽带似地促进了萧山地区的城乡物资交流，有时甚至富阳、浦江一带的农民也都要把当地的土特产运到临浦镇来集散。可是在过去，这里唯一的渡江工具只是几条破破烂烂的小木船，而且经常要出险。农民们是多么希望能够在江上架起一座桥来啊，哪怕是最简单的也好！可是多少年来，当地的人民怎么也没有能够实现这个愿望。曾经在农民中间流传过这样一个传说：不知道是多少年以前，也许是现在已经五、六十岁的老伯伯的爷爷手里吧，有一个管庙的人，决心要在这里的浦阳江上造一座桥。于是他就背着
  一只大木鱼，四处去化缘。许久许久以后，这个管庙的人化到了许多钱。可是不幸得很，他竟没有完成他的事业就死了。这笔钱也叫人贪污掉了。于是造桥的事情又化为泡影。但是人民造桥的愿望，在人民自己当家作主的时代，很快就变成了现实。
    在一九五三年下半年，这里附近各个乡都经过普选产生了乡人民代表大会代表，于是农民们就把自己的要求和意见告诉人民代表，要他们把意见反映到县里去。自然，大家不会忘记把造桥的事提出来。
    这一件关连着广大群众切身利益的提案，立刻引起了萧山县二届三次各界人民代表会议的注意，会议详细地讨论了这个提案，并向萧山县人民政府提出了造桥的建议。萧山县人民政府考虑到这是一个当地人民迫切需要解决的问题，经报请省人民政府批准以后，便决定在十月一日破土动工。
    要造桥的消息立刻传遍了全县，人民群众都高兴得欢腾起来了，他们纷纷传说着，欢笑着。有的说：“天底下真有这样好的事情，老百姓提了意见，人民政府就来造桥了。”有个叫关法的老伯伯，那时正在生病，他听到要造桥的消息，竟急得对儿子讲：“哎哟，盼望了一生的浮桥，现在人民政府来造了，让我去走一趟，就是死也瞑目！”
    不到两个月，浮桥造好了。每天，成千的人们从这里通过。去年年底临浦镇的物资交流大会原订计划作二亿元左右的交易，但是结果交易额提高到六亿元，这说明浮桥造好以后，对加强城乡物资交流是有重大关系的。
    浮桥造好之后，当地人民都进一步认识到人民自己当家作主的意义。正如浦南乡农业生产合作社社长、县人民代表、浮桥建筑委员会委员孔关根所说的：“造桥的事情是我们提的，桥又是我们自己亲手造的，我每次走过这座桥的时候，便想到在我们的国家里，一切权力是属于人民的。……”
    是的，“中华人民共和国的一切权力属于人民。”这是在宪法草案中明文规定下来的一句话，这也是我们国家的特征。
