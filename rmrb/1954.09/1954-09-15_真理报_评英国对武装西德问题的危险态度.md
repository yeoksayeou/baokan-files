    "Truth Daily" Comments on Britain's Dangerous Attitude Towards the Issue of Arming West Germany
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th] TASS reported that "Truth Daily" published an article by I. Alexandrov entitled: "New Conspiracy Against Arming West Germany."
    The article said: The general public in Britain and other countries welcomed the French National Assembly's decision to reject the "European Defense Community" treaty with great satisfaction. More and more Britons are expressing opposition to the restoration of West German militarism in any form. However, those responsible for formulating British foreign policy, disregarding the reasonable misgivings of the British people, believe that they can continue to pursue the policy of arming West Germany. This fact particularly alarmed the British public.
    After France rejected the "European Defense Community" treaty, some British politicians immediately announced that the issue of re-establishing West German armed forces "will not be removed from the agenda" and that efforts "must" be made to rearm West Germany and include West Germany in the Western "defense" system.
    But is the revival of West German militarism less of a threat to Britain than it is to France? Has history not proven that German militarism is an equally dangerous enemy to both Britain and France? Britain has not forgotten this, and has shown necessary and natural caution, in the past refusing to participate in the "European Coal and Steel Community" and the "European Defense Community." It is difficult for the British public to believe that it is precisely Britain that must run errands for arming West Germany, which is precisely the goal that American aggressors are trying to achieve.
    The article pointed out: While Washington and London are talking about vague "guarantees" and "supervision," people have already begun to take action in West Germany. There, preparations for the formation of an army of twelve divisions of 500,000 men and an air force of 80,000 men have now been completed; preparations for the formation of twenty-four divisions are also underway. In addition, Bonn is openly talking about establishing a reserve force of twenty-four divisions.
    The article pointed out: The result of West Germany's remilitarization and its inclusion in this or that military bloc will create insurmountable obstacles to Germany's reunification and hinder the achievement of an appropriate agreement on the German question. And for those who truly hope to promote the resolution of the German question, there is a broad road to achieve this goal, which is the road of seeking agreement among the parties concerned.

### “真理报”评英国对武装西德问题的危险态度

    “真理报”评英国对武装西德问题的危险态度
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十二日讯：“真理报”发表了伊·亚历山德罗夫的一篇文章，文章题目是：“反对武装西德的新阴谋”。
    文章说：英国和其他国家的一般社会人士都以非常满意的心情欢迎法国国民议会拒绝“欧洲防务集团”条约的决定。越来越多的英国人表示反对恢复任何形式的西德军国主义。可是，负责制订英国外交政策的人们不顾英国人民合乎情理的疑惧，认为可以继续奉行武装西德的方针。这个事实特别使英国社会人士感到惊慌。
    在法国拒绝了“欧洲防务集团”条约以后，英国的若干政治家立即就宣布说，重新建立西德武装部队的问题“将不从日程上取消”，“必须”设法重新武装西德，并把西德包括在西方“防务”体系以内。
    但是，难道西德军国主义的复活对英国的威胁要比对法国的威胁小吗？难道历史没有证明：德国军国主义对英国和法国都是同样危险的敌人吗？英国并没有忘记这一点，而且表现了必要的和自然的谨慎态度，在过去拒绝参加“欧洲煤钢联营集团”和“欧洲防务集团”，很难使英国一般社会人士相信：恰恰必须由英国来为武装西德跑腿，而武装西德正是美国侵略分子竭力想达到的目的。
    文章指出：当华盛顿和伦敦正在谈论含糊其词的各式各样“保证”和“监督”时，人们已经在西德开始行动了。在那里，成立由五十万人组成的十二个师的陆军部队和八万人的空军部队的准备工作现在已经完成；成立二十四个师的准备工作也正在紧张地进行。此外，波恩还正在公开地谈论着要成立二十四个师的后备部队。
    文章指出：西德重新军国主义化和把它拉入这一种或那一种军事集团的结果将为德国的重新统一造成难于克服的障碍，并阻碍就德国问题达成适当的协议。而真正希望促进德国问题解决的人们面前是有着达到这个目的的康庄大道的，这就是寻求有关方面的协议的道路。
