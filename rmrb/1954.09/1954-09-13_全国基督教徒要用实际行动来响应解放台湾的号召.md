    National Christians Should Respond to the Call to Liberate Taiwan with Practical Actions
    Wu Yaozong, Chairman of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of the Chinese Christians
      “Taiwan is China’s territory, and the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan.” This is the first sentence in the Joint Declaration for the Liberation of Taiwan by all democratic parties and people's organizations in the People’s Republic of China. This sentence expresses the firm will of the 600 million Chinese people to liberate Taiwan. It possesses the power of a thunderbolt, which no reactionary force can resist.
    To maintain the integrity of our national territory and to completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, we must liberate Taiwan. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, under the protection of the American aggressors, occupies Taiwan, sells out national interests, obstructs national unity, and threatens peace in the Far East. Every Chinese person with blood in their veins cannot tolerate the insane crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. Moreover, the eight million compatriots in Taiwan are under the tyrannical rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and their anticipation of liberation is like hoping for clouds in a great drought. Before liberation, the Chinese people suffered from the painful dark rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, which is still fresh in our memory. The Chinese people will never give up until this reactionary group, which once plunged hundreds of millions of Chinese people into an abyss of suffering, is eliminated, and we cannot allow it to continue to enslave our compatriots in Taiwan.
    Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. The liberation of Taiwan is China’s sovereignty and internal affair, and no other country is allowed to interfere. The American imperialists' occupation of Taiwan not only violates international law and infringes upon China’s sovereignty, but also seriously betrays the "Cairo Declaration" and the "Potsdam Proclamation" and other international agreements signed by the American government. If the American imperialists dare to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, they must bear all the serious consequences of their aggression. The American people should rise up to stop the American ruling group's aggressive acts of occupying Taiwan and interfering in China's internal affairs. The American army's occupation of Taiwan is unreasonable, and it is not worth it to work for the Wall Street bosses and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.
    The Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan is not only to safeguard the integrity of national territorial sovereignty and ensure national security, but also to defend peace in the Far East and the world. People know that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, who are afraid that the world will not be in chaos, are engaged in plotting new wars as a profession. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is not only the public enemy of the Chinese people but also the enemy of world peace. The United States protects the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and constantly harasses our coastal areas and loots merchant ships of various countries, seriously threatening peace in Asia. Only by liberating Taiwan and completely eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique can we further guarantee peace and security in the Far East and the world.
    We Christians love our country and love peace. Jesus Christ himself was a person who loved his country. According to Christ's teachings, we deeply hate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's acts of selling out the motherland and disrupting peace in the Far East and the world. Every Chinese Christian who loves the motherland and loves peace should support the government's liberation of Taiwan and completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique with practical actions.
    For four years, Chinese Christians have been widely carrying out the Three-Self Patriotic Movement. In the study of patriotism, and also inspired by countless new things, we have realized the greatness and lovability of the motherland, recognized the ferocious face of imperialism, and recognized the fact that imperialism used Christianity to carry out aggression in China. From July 22 to August 6 this year, more than 200 representatives from churches and Christian organizations across the country held the National Conference of Chinese Christians in Beijing. At the meeting, all representatives unanimously stated that they would more broadly and deeply develop the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of Chinese Christianity, safeguard the interests of the motherland, and oppose the aggression of American imperialism.
    Chinese Christians warmly support the peaceful foreign policy of the Central People's Government. On July 23, the second day of the opening of the National Conference of Chinese Christians, all representatives greeted with enthusiasm the news of the Geneva Conference reaching an agreement on the restoration of peace in Indochina and passed a declaration supporting this agreement. We should support with the same enthusiasm Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's foreign policy report at the 33rd meeting of the Central People's Government Committee, the Central People's Government Committee's resolution on approving this foreign policy report, and the Joint Declaration for the Liberation of Taiwan by all democratic parties and people's organizations in the People’s Republic of China. These three documents clearly and powerfully express the Chinese people's desire for peace. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence put forward by Premier Zhou Enlai in his foreign policy report are the only way to ease international tensions and ensure peaceful coexistence among countries. The liberation of Taiwan is fully in line with these five principles. As Premier Zhou Enlai said in his foreign policy report: "China has no intention of invading other countries' territories, nor will it tolerate other countries invading China's territories. China has no intention of infringing upon other countries' sovereignty, nor will it tolerate other countries infringing upon China's sovereignty. China has no intention of interfering in other countries' internal affairs, nor will it tolerate other countries interfering in China's internal affairs. China will never threaten the security of other countries, nor will it tolerate other countries threatening China's security." Therefore, we must call on Christian colleagues across the country to respond to the call to liberate Taiwan with a firm attitude and lofty patriotic enthusiasm.
    After China's liberation, many imperialist missionaries who withdrew from mainland China have been carrying out slanderous propaganda against the new Chinese church in Taiwan and sabotaging the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of Chinese Christianity. The liberation of Taiwan is to eliminate a hotbed of imperialism's rumors and sabotage against Chinese Christianity, so that imperialism's conspiracy to use Christianity to cover up aggression will suffer another failure.
    The liberation of Taiwan is a glorious and arduous historical task. We Christians should support the completion of this major task with practical actions. We must unite more closely with the people of the whole country, completely sever ties with imperialism, eliminate imperialist influences, study hard, and always be vigilant against the conspiracy of imperialism to use Chinese Christianity to carry out sabotage activities. We must abide by the country's constitution and laws, actively participate in the country's various construction undertakings, contribute our greatest strength to the realization of the country's bright and beautiful future, to the construction of a Chinese Christian church that is self-governing, self-supporting, and self-propagating, and to defending world peace.

    全国基督教徒要用实际行动来响应解放台湾的号召
    中国基督教三自爱国运动委员会主席　吴耀宗
      “台湾是中国的领土，中国人民一定要解放台湾。”这是中华人民共和国各民主党派各人民团体为解放台湾联合宣言中的第一句话。这句话表达了六亿中国人民解放台湾的坚决意志，它具有雷霆万钧的力量，是任何反动势力所不可抗拒的。
    为了保持我国领土的完整，为了彻底消灭蒋介石卖国集团，我们必须解放台湾。蒋介石卖国集团在美国侵略者庇护下窃据台湾，出卖国家利益，阻碍国家统一，威胁着远东和平；每一个有血气的中国人民，对于蒋介石卖国集团这种丧心病狂的罪行，都是不能容许的。而台湾的八百万同胞，处在蒋介石卖国集团的暴虐统治下，他们的期待解放，正如大旱之望云霓。解放前，中国人民曾经受过蒋介石卖国集团黑暗统治的痛苦，至今记忆犹新。这个曾使亿万中国人民陷于痛苦深渊的反动集团不被消灭，中国人民决不罢休，决不能让它继续奴役台湾的同胞。
    台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分。解放台湾是中国的主权和内政，不能容许他国来干涉。美帝国主义侵占台湾，不仅是破坏了国际公法，侵犯了中国主权，而且是对美国政府签字的“开罗宣言”和“波茨坦公告”等国际协定的严重背信弃义行为。如果美帝国主义者敢于阻挠中国人民解放台湾，它就必须承担自己侵略行为的一切严重后果。美国人民应该起来制止美国统治集团侵占台湾、干涉中国的内部事务的侵略行为。美国军队侵占台湾是毫无道理的，替华尔街老板和蒋介石匪帮卖命是毫不值得的。
    中国人民解放台湾不仅是为了维护国家领土主权完整、保障祖国安全，而且是为了保卫远东与世界和平。人们知道，唯恐天下不乱的蒋介石卖国集团，是以阴谋挑拨新的战争为职业的。蒋介石卖国集团不仅是中国人民的公敌，也是世界和平的敌人。美国庇护蒋介石卖国集团不断袭扰我国沿海地区，打劫各国商船，严重地威胁了亚洲的和平。只有解放台湾，彻底消灭蒋介石卖国集团，才能进一步保障远东及世界的和平与安全。
    我们基督徒是热爱祖国、热爱和平的。耶稣基督自己便是一个热爱祖国的人。根据基督的教训，我们深切地痛恨蒋介石卖国集团出卖祖国、扰乱远东和世界和平的行为。每一个热爱祖国、热爱和平的中国基督徒，都要用实际行动来拥护政府解放台湾，彻底消灭蒋介石卖国集团。
    四年以来，中国的基督徒普遍地进行了三自爱国运动。在爱国主义的学习中，也由于无数新事物的启发，我们认识了祖国的伟大可爱，认识了帝国主义穷凶极恶的面目，认识了帝国主义利用基督教在中国进行侵略的事实。今年七月二十二日到八月六日全国各教会各基督教团体二百多位代表在北京举行了中国基督教全国会议。在会议中，全体代表一致表示要更广泛深入地发展中国基督教的三自爱国运动，维护祖国的利益，反对美帝国主义的侵略。
    中国基督徒热烈拥护中央人民政府的和平外交政策。在中国基督教全国会议开幕的第二天——七月二十三日，全体代表以热烈的心情迎接了日内瓦会议达成关于恢复印度支那和平的协议的消息，并通过了拥护这个协议的宣言。我们应当以同样热烈的心情来拥护周恩来总理兼外长在中央人民政府委员会第三十三次会议上的外交报告、中央人民政府委员会关于批准这个外交报告的决议、中华人民共和国各民主党派各人民团体为解放台湾联合宣言。这三个文件都清楚地、有力地表达了中国人民和平的愿望。周恩来总理在外交报告中所提出的和平共处的五项原则，是缓和国际紧张局势、保证各国和平共处的唯一途径。解放台湾与这五项原则是完全符合的。正如周恩来总理在外交报告中所说：“中国没有侵略别国领土的意图，也决不容忍别国侵略中国的领土。中国没有侵犯别国主权的意图，也决不容忍别国侵犯中国的主权。中国没有干涉别国内政的意图，也决不容忍别国干涉中国的内政。中国决不威胁别国的安全，也决不容忍别国威胁中国的安全。”因此，我们要号召全国基督教同道，以坚决的态度和崇高的爱国热情来响应解放台湾的号召。
    中国解放以后，许多从中国大陆撤退的帝国主义传教士就一直在台湾对新中国的教会进行诬蔑的宣传，对中国基督教三自爱国运动进行破坏活动。解放台湾就是消灭帝国主义对中国基督教造谣破坏的一个温床，使帝国主义利用基督教来掩护侵略的阴谋遭受又一次的失败。
    解放台湾是一个光荣的和艰巨的历史任务。我们基督徒应当用实际的行动来支持完成这个重大的任务。我们要和全国人民更加紧密地团结起来，彻底地割断与帝国主义的关系，肃清帝国主义的影响，努力学习，并经常对帝国主义利用中国基督教来进行破坏活动的阴谋提高警惕。我们要遵守国家的宪法与法律，积极参加祖国各项建设事业，为实现祖国光明美好的前途，为建设中国基督教自治、自养、自传的教会，为保卫世界和平而贡献出最大的力量。
