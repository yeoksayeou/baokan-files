    [This Newspaper's Report] The work of publicizing and discussing the draft constitution in Beijing has now concluded, and it has basically reached every household. Approximately 1,035,700 people from all walks of life in the city (excluding central-level organs) heard reports on the draft constitution and participated in preliminary discussions, and approximately 552,000 people participated in chapter-by-chapter and article-by-article discussions. In the discussions, people from all walks of life put forward a total of 143,565 opinions on the draft constitution, of which 22.2% were on the preamble, 32.3% on the general principles, 19.1% on state organs, 20.7% on the basic rights and obligations of citizens, and 5.7% on the national flag, national emblem, capital, and other opinions. The Beijing Draft Constitution Discussion Committee has compiled these opinions and reported them to the Drafting Committee of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China.
    After the Beijing Draft Constitution Discussion Committee was established on June 1, it prepared to carry out the publicity and discussion of the draft constitution throughout the city. First, from June 1 to 18, it focused on training more than 4,000 reporters and key members to assist in studying and discussing the constitution in the city. Immediately afterward, districts and units also trained more than 20,000 propagandists, grassroots cadres of trade unions in factories and mines, and activists from street residents. After the draft constitution was promulgated, extensive publicity activities were gradually carried out, and people from all walks of life were organized to study and conduct preliminary discussions.
    On the basis of the preliminary understanding of the basic spirit and main content of the draft constitution by the masses of all strata, the Beijing Draft Constitution Discussion Committee continued to conduct in-depth publicity among cadres of government organs, teachers and staff of schools, workers, rural cadres, members of agricultural production cooperatives, and activists among street residents, and organized chapter-by-chapter and article-by-article discussions. Everyone felt very satisfied that the state had handed the draft constitution over to the whole people for discussion. The number of people who regularly participated in discussions in many government organs and factories reached 90% of the total number of people. More than 80% of representatives of ethnic minorities and religious circles participated in the discussions. Some members of democratic parties came from afar even in the rain to participate in the discussions. A member of the Xinzhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fengtai District said: "In the old society, we were not allowed to know any laws, and 'Don't Talk About State Affairs' was written everywhere. Now the constitution is for us to discuss, which means the people have rights." People from all walks of life conducted discussions in a serious and responsible manner with the attitude of masters, and actively put forward their own opinions on the draft constitution, so as to make our country's first constitution the most perfect fundamental law of the state. When the workers of the Fourth Workshop of the Beijing Public Transport Company conducted article-by-article discussions, many group workers arrived early. Li Fengming, a labor model from the Shijingshan Power Plant and leader of the A class of the Steam Turbine Workshop, is fifty-seven years old this year. He puts on his glasses and reads the draft constitution word by word, actively putting forward his own opinions. He said: "If I see something in the draft constitution that I think is inappropriate, I will bring it up. Maybe my view is wrong, but as long as I put forward my opinion, it will be beneficial to the formulation of the constitution." In just over an hour, their group discussed five articles in the draft constitution and put forward twelve amendments and supplementary opinions. Many farmers in the suburbs also enthusiastically participated in the discussion of the draft constitution despite the fatigue of farming. When teachers and staff of various universities discussed the draft constitution, many teachers made full preparations beforehand, and some professors at Normal University even prepared speaking outlines. Teachers and staff of various universities put forward more than 10,000 opinions on the draft constitution. From the opinions put forward on the draft constitution, it can be seen that the broad masses of the people in the capital have infinite love and trust for the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Many people suggested adding "under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong" to the second sentence of the preamble. An even more common opinion was to propose adding an article to the constitution explaining the importance of the Party's leadership for the Chinese people's revolution and socialist construction. Of the 22,878 opinions put forward by people from all walks of life in Xuanwu District alone, 1,028 belonged to this category.
    From some of the amendments and supplementary opinions, we can see the people's yearning for a socialist society and their strong desire to build socialism. Many people felt that it was not enough to use "prosperity and happiness" to describe socialist society in the first paragraph of the preamble, and proposed changing it to: "a prosperous, strong, happy, and free socialist society," "a prosperous, happy, and prosperous socialist society for everyone," "a prosperous, happy, and beautiful socialist society," and so on.
    The people of Beijing are very satisfied with the basic rights and obligations of citizens stipulated in the draft constitution. In order to prevent counter-revolutionaries and other bad elements from taking advantage of the people's broad democratic rights, they also put forward some supplementary opinions, suggesting that the sentence "except for those who have been deprived of political rights according to law" should be added to Article 87; the provision "except for those caught in the act" should be added to Article 89; and a clause should be added to the citizens' obligations: "Vigilance against counter-revolutionaries is a quality that every citizen should possess."
    In addition, some people proposed adding "transforming the backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country" below "guaranteeing that our country can eliminate exploitation and poverty through peaceful means" in the first paragraph of the preamble; changing "new political and economic victories" to "new political, economic, and cultural victories" in the third paragraph. "Gradually expand the material conditions for workers' rest and recuperation..." in Article 92 should be preceded by "on the basis of developing production."
    In the process of studying and discussing the constitution, the people's enthusiasm for socialist construction has become even higher. They have expressed their support for the draft constitution with practical actions and welcomed the birth of our country's first constitution. On the gift-offering platform set up by the Shijingshan Power Plant to welcome the birth of the constitution, there are already "gifts" from thirty-eight groups. In this creative labor, many workers have solved some difficult problems in production that have not been solved for many years. When the staff and workers of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory discussed the draft constitution, they combined it with the implementation of the work plan, so that the number of days for locomotive repairs at the factory was gradually shortened from twenty-one days to more than fourteen days. During the period of studying and discussing the draft constitution, the seventeen state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private factories in Xuanwu District made 141 major improvements and creations in production. The improvement of two technical measures by the red leather tanning group of the Beijing People's Tannery can increase profits by 280 million yuan throughout the year. After the farmers of Datun Township in the eastern suburbs studied the draft constitution, the five electoral districts launched challenges and competitions with each other in flood prevention and drainage work. The farmers of Xiao Chen Gezhuang Township put forward the slogan "Guarantee that the water will be clear after the rain stops." On rainy days, they collectively dug twelve drainage ditches ranging from half a mile to one mile long, and even more small ditches. Many individual farmers also expressed their determination to take the road of mutual assistance and cooperation. In Qishu Township, Dongjiao District, the original twenty peasant households in Jiangtaiwa Village requested to join the cooperative. After the publicity of the draft constitution, the number has increased to forty. Jia Defu, a farmer from Dongba Town, immediately ran to the agricultural production cooperative with his land certificate after studying the draft constitution to request to join the cooperative. In Fengtai District, 3,500 peasant households requested to join the cooperative.

    北京市结束讨论宪法草案
    各界人民积极提出修改和补充意见
    【本报讯】北京市宣传和讨论宪法草案工作现在已经结束，基本上作到了家喻户晓。全市（不包括中央级各机关）听到关于宪法草案报告并参加初步讨论的各界人民约有一百零三万五千七百多人，参加逐章逐条讨论的约有五十五万二千多人。在讨论中各界人民共提出对宪法草案的意见十四万三千五百六十五件，其中序言部分占总数的百分之二十二点二，总纲部分占百分之三十二点三，国家机构部分占百分之十九点一，公民的基本权利和义务部分占百分之二十点七，国旗、国徽、首都部分和其他意见占百分之五点七。北京市宪法草案讨论委员会把这些意见整理后，已陆续汇报中华人民共和国宪法起草委员会。
    北京市宪法草案讨论委员会在六月一日成立后，即准备在全市开展宪法草案的宣传和讨论，首先在六月一日至十八日集中训练了全市的报告员和辅导学习讨论的骨干分子共四千多人；紧接着各区、各单位也训练了宣传员、厂矿企业工会基层干部、街道居民积极分子两万多人。宪法草案公布后，即逐步开展广泛的宣传活动，并组织各界人民进行学习和初步的讨论。
    北京市宪法草案讨论委员会在各阶层群众初步了解宪法草案的基本精神和主要内容的基础上，继续在机关干部、学校教职员、工人、农村干部和农业生产合作社社员、街道居民积极分子中，进一步深入地进行了宣传，组织逐章逐条的讨论。大家对国家把宪法草案交给全民讨论，都感到非常满意。许多机关和工厂经常参加讨论的达到总人数的百分之九十。少数民族、宗教界代表人物参加讨论的达到百分之八十以上；各民主党派有的成员在雨天也远道赶来参加讨论。丰台区辛庄农业生产合作社社员说：“旧社会什么法也不让我们知道，到处写着‘莫谈国事’，现在宪法叫咱们讨论，这就是人民有权利。”各阶层人民都以主人翁的态度认真负责地进行讨论，积极提出自己对宪法草案的意见，以便使我国的第一部宪法成为最完善的国家根本法。北京市公共汽车公司第四车间工人进行逐条讨论时，许多小组工人都提前到会。石景山发电厂劳动模范、汽机场甲班班长李凤鸣，今年五十七岁，眼睛花了戴上眼镜，一字一句地阅读宪法草案，积极提出自己的意见。他说：“看见宪法草案上有自己认为有不合适的地方就提出来，也许我的看法不对，但是只要把意见提出来，对制定宪法就有好处。”他们小组在一个多钟头时间，讨论了宪法草案中的五条，就提出修改补充意见十二条。郊区许多农民也不顾耕作的疲劳，热情地参加宪法草案的讨论。各高等学校教职员在讨论宪法草案时，许多教师都在事前作了充分准备，师范大学有些教授还作了发言提纲。各高等学校教职员就提了一万多条对宪法草案的意见。从对宪法草案所提的意见中，可以看出首都广大人民群众对中国共产党和毛主席的无限的热爱和信任。许多人提出在序言第二句中加上“在毛泽东主席的领导下”的意见，更普遍的意见是提议在宪法中增加条文，说明党的领导对中国人民革命和建设社会主义的重要性。仅宣武区各界人民所提的两万二千八百七十八件意见中，就有一千零二十八件是属于这类意见的。
    从一些修改和补充意见中，可以看出人民群众对社会主义社会的向往和建设社会主义的强烈愿望。很多人认为序言第一段中用“繁荣幸福”来形容社会主义社会还不够，提出改为：“繁荣、富强、幸福、自由的社会主义社会”，“繁荣、幸福、大家富裕的社会主义社会”，“繁荣、幸福、美好的社会主义社会”等等。
    北京人民对于宪法草案所规定的公民基本权利和义务非常满意，为了防止反革命分子和其他坏分子利用人民的广泛的民主权利钻空子，他们还提出一些补充意见，建议第八十七条中应增加“依照法律被剥夺政治权利的人除外”一句；第八十九条中应增加“现行犯除外”的规定；在公民的义务中，应增加一条“对反革命分子的警惕是每一个公民应有的品质”。
    此外，还有人提出，序言第一段中“保证我国能够通过和平的道路消灭剥削和贫困”的下面加上“变落后的农业国为先进的工业国”；第三段中“政治上、经济上的新胜利”改为“政治上、经济上、文化上的新胜利”。第九十二条中“逐步扩充劳动者休息和休养的物质条件……”上面应增加“在发展生产的基础上，”。
    人民群众在学习和讨论宪法的过程中，社会主义建设的热情更加高涨，纷纷表示以实际行动拥护宪法草案，迎接我国第一个宪法的诞生。石景山发电厂为了迎接宪法诞生而设的献礼台上，已经有了三十八个小组的“献礼”，许多工人在这创造性的劳动中，解决了若干生产中多年未能解决的困难问题。长辛店机车车辆修理工厂的职工，在讨论宪法草案时，结合贯彻作业计划，使机车在厂的修理日数逐步由二十一天缩短到十四天多。宣武区十七个国营、地方国营和公私合营工厂，在学习和讨论宪法草案期间，生产上的较大的改进和创造就有一百四十一件。北京人民制革厂红皮鞣制组的两项技术措施的改进，全年就可增加利润两亿八千万元。东郊区大屯乡农民学习了宪法草案以后，在防涝排水工作中，五个选区互相展开挑战竞赛；小陈各庄乡农民提出了“保证雨停水净”的口号，在多雨的日子里，他们集体挖了半里至一里长的泄水沟十二条和更多的小水沟。许多个体农民也表示坚决要走互助合作的道路。东郊区七树乡将台洼村原有二十户农民要求入社，经过宪法草案的宣传后，已增到四十户；东霸镇农民贾德福学习宪法草案后，立即拿着土地证跑到农业生产合作社去要求入社。丰台区有三千五百户农民要求入社。
