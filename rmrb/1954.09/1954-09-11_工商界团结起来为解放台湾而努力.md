The Industrial and Commercial Circles Unite to Strive for the Liberation of Taiwan
Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce

    Our country's democratic parties and people's organizations have issued a joint declaration for the liberation of Taiwan, solemnly declaring to the world: Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan! This is a great and just declaration of the Chinese people, expressing the common will and firm and unwavering stance and attitude of the 600 million Chinese people to liberate Taiwan.

    Everyone knows that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's sacred territory. Sixty years ago, Japanese imperialism forcibly occupied Taiwan. The Chinese people, after a long struggle, expelled the Japanese aggressors in the victory of the great War of Resistance Against Japan, returning Taiwan to the embrace of the motherland and restoring our country's sovereignty. However, when the Chinese people were liberating mainland China, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique fled to Taiwan and turned it into a lair of traitors. The US ruling clique, betraying the "Cairo Declaration" and the "Potsdam Proclamation" it had signed, protected a handful of Chiang Kai-shek's remnant bandits, occupied Taiwan, and used it as part of its sinister plan to invade mainland China, interfere in our country's internal affairs, and subvert our people's regime.

    Since the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique occupied Taiwan, it has been frantic, committed all kinds of evil, plundered the people's wealth, massacred patriotic compatriots, persecuted overseas Chinese, forced young people to serve as cannon fodder, attacked coastal islands of the motherland, bombed coastal cities of the motherland, sent special agents to infiltrate the mainland of the motherland, carried out pirate interceptions of our country's merchant ships and merchant ships from various countries coming to our country, and attempted to cooperate with the US armed forces to attack the mainland of the motherland and provoke a world war, causing mankind to suffer the catastrophe of war again. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang has committed countless heinous crimes.

    Under the unprecedented rise of peace forces throughout the world, thanks to the victory of the Geneva Conference, the peace agreement in Indochina was reached, and the international tension was further eased. The US ruling clique was unwilling to accept its defeat. In order to continue creating international tension, in addition to stepping up its instigation and assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to carry out more rampant harassing and destructive wars against our mainland and coastal areas, it recently openly dispatched fleets to invade our territorial waters, shot down two of our planes over Hainan Island, and continued to clamor for armed intervention in our liberation of Taiwan to intimidate our people.

    Liberating Taiwan is our people's glorious historical task of realizing national reunification. Without the liberation of Taiwan, not only will our country's territorial sovereignty be incomplete and our peaceful construction be threatened, and our trade with various countries will be severely hindered, but it will also increase the threat of war in the Far East, make the international situation tense, and prevent China and other relevant countries from enjoying the benefits of peace. Therefore, Premier Zhou Enlai instructed us: "Only by liberating Taiwan from the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous bandits, only by completing this glorious task, can we realize the complete unification of our great motherland, can we obtain the complete victory of the great Chinese people's liberation cause, and can we further guarantee peace and security in the Far East and the world."

    We have not only the firm confidence but also the full strength to liberate Taiwan. Our liberation of Taiwan is a just cause. The 600 million people who have stood up fully know how to defend their sacred national rights and national dignity. The long-tempered People's Liberation Army has become a strong and modern army, ready to fight for the final liberation of Taiwan at any time. The Taiwan compatriots have carried out continuous and heroic struggles against Japanese imperialism in the past, and have also carried out countless resistances against the bloody rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. The Taiwan compatriots with revolutionary traditions will never be willing to be in dire straits for a long time. It is the unanimous demand of the Taiwan compatriots to be liberated as soon as possible. As long as the opportunity arises, the Taiwan compatriots will certainly participate in the sacred battle to liberate Taiwan. The so-called hundreds of thousands of troops controlled by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique are mostly good people who have been coerced. Not only do they have no fighting spirit, but everyone is eager to return to their hometown in the motherland. In recent years, many people have risked death to come over to surrender, which is clear evidence. Now the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is only relying on the protection of the US ruling clique to prolong its life and vainly attempt to oppose the 600 million people of the motherland to the end.

    The joint declaration solemnly pointed out that liberating Taiwan and eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is an exercise of China's sovereignty and is China's internal affair, which does not allow any foreign interference. If foreign aggressors dare to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, dare to infringe upon our country's sovereignty and undermine our country's territorial integrity, and dare to interfere in our country's internal affairs, then they must bear all the serious consequences of this act of aggression.

    We Chinese people cannot be intimidated by any imperialism. After World War II, the US ruling clique supported and directed the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to launch a civil war to be enemies with our people, and suffered a tragic defeat. In launching the criminal war of aggression against Korea, they also wanted to use Korea as a springboard to invade our mainland, but the result was even more disastrous. If US imperialism dares to interfere in our liberation of Taiwan, it should bear all the serious consequences. The peace-loving people all over the world are supporting us, because our liberation of Taiwan is to eliminate a root cause of the United States' use to create international tension and create new war dangers, which will further consolidate peace in Asia and the world, expand the area of collective peace, enable all countries to coexist peacefully, and enjoy all the benefits of international trade and peace.

    The urgent task of liberating Taiwan is before the people of the whole country. The joint declaration solemnly calls on us: "In order to liberate Taiwan, our compatriots across the country must strengthen unity, heighten vigilance, increase production, practice strict economy, and improve labor productivity, and strive to complete and overfulfill the national construction plan!" Our national industrialists and businessmen fully support this solemn oath and are determined to contribute their greatest strength to the liberation of Taiwan in their respective positions. We must carry out propaganda and education to our colleagues and relatives around us, explain the great significance of liberating Taiwan, strive for relatives and friends living in Taiwan to sever relations with the Chiang bandits, and participate in the sacred struggle to liberate Taiwan. We must do a good job in processing, ordering, and all material supply work, correct our business style, improve business management, complete national tasks, and fully support the needs of liberating Taiwan. At the same time, we must strive to bring enterprises into the orbit of state capitalism, carry out socialist transformation, and accelerate the socialist industrialization of our motherland in order to further strengthen the strength of national defense. Our national industrialists and businessmen have, through our own organization - the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce - together with the people of the whole country, participated in the solemn declaration. We guarantee that we will definitely respond to the call with practical actions, unite more strongly around the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, and fight to the end for the liberation of Taiwan, opposition to US interference, safeguarding national security, and defending world peace!

    工商界团结起来为解放台湾而努力
    中华全国工商业联合会主任委员  陈叔通
    我国各民主党派、各人民团体，已发出了为解放台湾的联合宣言，严正地向全世界宣告：台湾是中国的领土，中国人民一定要解放台湾！这是中国人民伟大的正义的宣言，表达了中国六万万人民解放台湾的共同意志和坚定不移的立场与态度。
      谁都知道：台湾是中国神圣领土的不可分割的部分，六十年前日本帝国主义强占了台湾，中国人民经过了长期的斗争，于伟大的抗日战争胜利中驱逐了日本侵略者，使台湾回到祖国的怀抱，恢复了我国的主权。而在中国人民解放中国大陆的时候，蒋介石卖国集团逃据台湾，却把台湾变成了叛国贼的巢穴。美国统治集团背信弃义地破坏了自己所曾经签订的“开罗宣言”和“波茨坦公告”，庇护一小撮蒋介石卖国残匪，侵占台湾，作为侵略我国大陆、干涉我国内政、颠覆我国人民政权的罪恶计划的一部分。
  蒋介石卖国集团自从盘踞台湾以来，丧心病狂，无恶不作，搜括人民财富，残杀爱国同胞，迫害华侨，强迫青年充当炮灰，袭击祖国沿海岛屿，轰炸祖国沿海城市，派遣特务潜入祖国大陆，对我国商船和各国来我国的商船进行海盗拦劫，并妄图配合美国武装力量，进攻祖国大陆，挑拨世界战争，使人类重遭战争浩劫。蒋介石匪帮所有滔天罪行，是数不尽的。
    在全世界和平力量空前高涨下，由于日内瓦会议的胜利，达成了印度支那的和平协议，国际紧张局势得到了进一步的缓和，美国统治集团不甘心于它的失败，为了继续制造国际紧张局势，除了加紧地指使和援助蒋介石卖国集团，对我国大陆和沿海更加猖獗地进行骚扰性和破坏性的战争外，最近并公然地派遣舰队，侵入我国领海，在我国海南岛上空，击落我国飞机两架，并不断叫嚣，要对我国解放台湾进行武装干涉，来恫吓我国人民。
    解放台湾是我国人民实现国家统一的光荣的历史任务。台湾没有解放，不但我国领土主权不能完整，我国和平建设遭受到威胁，我国和各国的贸易遭受到严重的阻碍，而且也增加远东战争威胁，使国际局势紧张，使中国和其他有关国家不能享受和平利益。所以，周恩来总理指示我们说：“只有把台湾从蒋介石卖国贼的统治下解放出来，只有完成这个光荣的任务，才能实现我们伟大祖国的完全的统一，才能获得伟大的中国人民解放事业的完全的胜利，才能进一步地保障远东及世界的和平和安全。”
    我们解放台湾，不但有坚强的信心，而且具有充分的力量。我们解放台湾是正义的事业，站起来了的六万万人民，充分地知道怎样保卫自己神圣的民族权利和民族尊严。久经锻炼的人民解放军，已成为坚强的现代化军队，时刻准备着为最后解放台湾而斗争。台湾同胞过去对日本帝国主义曾进行过不断的英勇斗争，对蒋介石卖国集团的血腥统治，也进行过无数次的反抗，具有革命传统的台湾同胞，决不甘心长期地处在水深火热之中，早日获得解放是台湾同胞的一致要求。只要时机一到，台湾同胞定将参加解放台湾的神圣战斗。蒋介石卖国集团所控制的所谓几十万军队，其中极大多数都是被胁迫的善良人民，他们不但毫无斗志，而且人人渴望回返祖国家乡。几年来已有很多人宁冒死亡的危险，纷纷前来投诚，便是明证。现在蒋介石卖国集团只是依靠着美国统治集团的庇护，苟延残喘，妄图与祖国六万万人民作对到底。
    联合宣言庄严地指出：解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，是行使中国的主权，是中国的内政，决不容许任何外国干涉。如果外国侵略者敢于阻止中国人民解放台湾，敢于侵犯我国主权和破坏我国领土完整，敢于干涉我国内政，那么，他们就必须承担这一侵略行为的一切严重后果。
    我们中国人民是任何帝国主义所吓不倒的。在第二次世界大战之后，美国统治集团支持和指使蒋介石卖国集团发动内战，来和我国人民为敌，遭受到悲惨的失败；在发动罪恶的侵略朝鲜战争中，又想以朝鲜为跳板，来侵略我国大陆，结果更是碰得头破血流。美帝国主义如敢干涉我国解放台湾，应担负一切严重的后果。全世界爱好和平的人民都在支持我们，因为我们解放台湾是消除美国借以制造国际紧张局势和制造新战争危险的一个祸根，这将会更加巩固亚洲及世界的和平，扩大集体和平的区域，使各国和平共处，享受国际贸易和和平的一切利益。
    解放台湾的急迫任务，摆在全国人民的面前，联合宣言庄严的号召我们：“为了解放台湾，我全国同胞必须加强团结，提高警惕，增加生产，厉行节约，提高劳动生产率，为争取完成和超额完成国家建设计划而奋斗！”我们全国工商业者完全拥护这一庄严的誓辞，决心在各自不同的岗位上，为解放台湾而贡献出自己最大的力量。我们要对我们周围的同业及亲友进行宣传教育，说明解放台湾的重大意义，争取住在台湾的亲友断绝蒋匪帮关系，并参加到解放台湾的神圣斗争的行列中来。我们要做好加工、订货，及一切物资供应工作，端正经营作风，改善经营管理，完成国家任务，充分支援解放台湾的需要。同时，我们要努力把企业纳入国家资本主义的轨道，进行社会主义改造，加速我们祖国的社会主义工业化，以进一步加强国防的力量。我们全国工商业者已由我们自己的团体——中华全国工商业联合会为代表，和全国人民一起，参加了严正的宣言，我们保证一定以实际行动来响应号召，更加坚强地团结在中国共产党和人民政府的周围，为解放台湾，反对美国干涉，保障祖国安全和保卫世界和平而奋斗到底！
