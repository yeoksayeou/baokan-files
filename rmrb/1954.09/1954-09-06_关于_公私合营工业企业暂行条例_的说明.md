Explanation of the "Provisional Regulations on Joint State-Private Industrial Enterprises"
Li Weihan, Deputy Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government

Premier:
    The "Provisional Regulations on Joint State-Private Industrial Enterprises" are now submitted to the Government Administration Council for review.
    The socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is an important component of the general task of the state during the transition period. The state's implementation of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is to encourage and guide them to transform into various forms of state capitalist economy; and gradually replace capitalist ownership with socialist ownership by the whole people. Based on the experience of implementing the policy of state capitalism in the past few years, especially due to the education of the general line and general task of the transition period, people have increasingly realized that gradually completing the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce through different forms of state capitalism is a sounder direction and method.
    After several years of utilization, restriction, and transformation by the state, most of capitalist industry has been transformed into various intermediate forms (processing, ordering, unified purchase, exclusive sales) of state capitalist economy. According to statistics from the Central Administration for Industry and Commerce, in the first quarter of 1954, the output value of processing, ordering, unified purchase, and exclusive sales accounted for 86.4% of the total output value of private large-scale industries in the eight major cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, and Xi'an. Through the various intermediate forms of state capitalism, the state has gradually strengthened its control over the supply of raw materials and the sales of products of most capitalist industries, and has brought their production into the orbit of national planning to varying degrees, restricting the destructive effects of their production anarchy to varying degrees, and giving play to their positive role conducive to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Through these forms, the Communist Party organizations and trade union organizations in some enterprises have strengthened their leadership and supervision over production, and have promoted various reforms in these enterprises to a greater or lesser extent. Through these forms, the labor of the working masses in enterprises is mainly for the needs of the country, and only a small part is for the profits of capitalists, which makes the working masses feel interested in their labor, and their labor productivity has therefore increased a step further. Through these forms, capitalists in enterprises can not only receive reasonable profits, but also be more directly educated in patriotism, law-abiding, and obedience to the leadership of the state-owned economy. It can be seen that the intermediate forms of state capitalism are an important step for the state to utilize, restrict, and transform capitalist industry, and they have played a considerably important role in developing production and supplying needs within a certain period, and in preparing conditions for these enterprises to develop towards the advanced forms of state capitalism. State economic workers, workers and staff in capitalist enterprises, capitalists and their agents should continue to actively strive to better complete the state's processing, ordering, unified purchase, and exclusive sales tasks.
    However, after capitalist industry is transformed into intermediate forms of state capitalism, the enterprise is still owned by the capitalists, and the operation and management of the enterprise is still in accordance with capitalist methods. Therefore, the contradictions between public and private, labor and capital, and many other contradictions cannot be dealt with more effectively. In the relationship between public and private, although some capitalists can obey the interests of the state under the leadership of the People's Government and the state-owned economy, and show their enthusiasm in completing processing, ordering, unified purchase, and exclusive sales tasks, many capitalists do not take this attitude, but still take a profit-seeking attitude. Although they have accepted processing, ordering, unified purchase, and exclusive sales, they do not complete the tasks according to the requirements of the state, that is, not in quantity, quality, or on time. At the same time, they do not care about the improvement of operation and management and the improvement of technology, resulting in very low product quality, very high costs, and extremely serious waste. Some products that were well-known brands when they were sold by themselves have become unsalable goods due to reduced quality after being exclusively sold by the state. Many capitalists continue to engage in illegal activities such as cutting corners, using inferior materials to replace good ones, and falsely reporting costs. Some capitalists use the method of increasing wages to win over a small number of backward workers, and use this to increase the profit margins turned over to the state. Some capitalists even take various methods to resist. In addition, the capitalist mode of operation and management hinders the state from statistically analyzing and utilizing the production capacity of enterprises, thus, on the one hand, the production potential of enterprises cannot be properly utilized, and on the other hand, it causes some blind confusion in production. In terms of labor-capital relations, the corrupt management methods of capitalism and the resulting chaos in the wage system and working hour system are increasingly becoming a serious obstacle to improving the labor enthusiasm and production innovation spirit of the workers and staff, and have a great negative impact on the production of these enterprises, as well as extremely unfavorable effects on the wage system, working hour system, and the unity within the working class of state-owned factories. The existence and development of these contradictions have restricted the improvement of labor productivity and the development of social productive forces, and have also restricted the education and transformation of capitalists and their agents. Thus, it is necessary to gradually develop these industries from intermediate forms of state capitalism to advanced forms, that is, joint state-private forms.
    When an intermediate form of state capitalism or a general capitalist enterprise is transformed into a joint state-private enterprise, the production relations of the enterprise will undergo the following important changes: (1) The enterprise is changed from private ownership to joint state-private ownership, and the socialist component cooperates with the capitalist component within the enterprise and occupies a leading position. In joint ventures, the legitimate rights and interests of private shares still exist and are protected, but capitalists are under the leadership of the public side, changing their position of dominating the enterprise during the private period. (2) The operation and management of joint ventures no longer adopts capitalist methods, but will gradually be in line with state-owned enterprises, completely guided by the goal of developing production, guaranteeing needs, and meeting the requirements of the national plan. That is to say, the basic socialist economic law and the law of planned development of the national economy will play a direct role in joint ventures. Many enterprises have fundamentally changed their operation and management policies after joint state-private ownership, making the production of the enterprise conform to the needs of the country and greatly improving the condition of the enterprise. For example, before joint state-private ownership, Minsheng Company would not accept the state's grain transportation tasks unless at a high price, and would rather leave ships and barges empty, filling them with sand and water; after joint state-private ownership, it lowered freight rates to transport grain for the state, enabling a large amount of Sichuan grain to be transported out, and also gave play to the transportation potential of ships and barges, promoting the increase in production and economy movement, and turning the enterprise from a state of heavy losses to a state of surplus. (3) The position of workers in the enterprise has changed, and the public side and the masses of workers and staff combine to occupy the leading position in the enterprise; therefore, the masses of workers and staff adopt the attitude of being the masters of the enterprise, and their labor enthusiasm and labor productivity are greatly improved. In the process of preparing for joint state-private ownership, the workers and technicians of many enterprises excitedly welcomed the joint ownership of the enterprise with their labor enthusiasm and creativity. For example, in order to welcome joint state-private ownership, the workers of Shanghai Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory rebuilt a large furnace in nine days (it used to take three months to dismantle and rebuild a large furnace), and the technicians also successfully trial-produced anti-tuberculosis drugs. In the process of preparing for joint ownership, the workers of Tianjin Beiyang Yarn Factory overfulfilled the production plan every month, and actively assisted in the property inventory work; in order to put the 8,800 spindles newly installed with state investment into production as soon as possible, they further exerted their labor enthusiasm and creativity, continuously improved work efficiency, and completed the installation work ahead of schedule. (4) Capitalists and their agents receive direct and regular leadership and education from the public side, and receive help and supervision from the masses of workers and staff, thus making it possible for them to learn new things and new ideas in practice, gradually transform themselves, and correctly exert their talents and positive role. (5) In the distribution of profits, in addition to a small portion being used to pay dividends and appropriately improve the welfare of workers and staff, most of the enterprise's profits can be used to develop production according to the national plan. Since the operation and management of the enterprise is improved and the labor enthusiasm of the workers and staff is improved after joint state-private ownership, the profit of the enterprise is generally increased compared to the private ownership period, and more funds can be accumulated to expand production. For example, in the five years of joint state-private ownership, Tangshan Huaxin Yarn Factory not only paid dividends to shareholders, but also expanded production equipment, and this newly expanded production equipment is almost equal to twice the investment and construction in the 30 years before joint ownership.
    The above important changes in the production relations of the enterprise make joint state-private enterprises semi-socialist enterprises, which have advantages that cannot be compared with the intermediate forms of state capitalism. The semi-socialist nature of joint ventures and their advantages are inseparable from the superiority of the socialist component itself and its leading position and leading role in the enterprise. Joint ventures give play to the superiority of the socialist component and the leading role of the socialist component, so that they can correctly unite workers, improve labor productivity, effectively educate capitalists and their agents to accept reforms in operation and management, improve product quality, reduce product costs, and increase the quantity of products according to the needs and possibilities of the country, and at the same time enable enterprises to obtain more profits, accumulate funds, expand reproduction, enable workers and staff to obtain necessary improvements in their lives, and also enable capitalists to obtain reasonable profits. The state invests the necessary funds in enterprises to implement joint state-private ownership, which forms a certain proportion of public and private shares, but the leading position and leading role of the socialist component in joint ventures and the continuous strengthening of this leading position and leading role do not depend on the amount of state investment, but on the nature of the state power and the position of the socialist economy in the national economy, and depend on the combination of public representatives and the masses of workers and staff in the enterprise and their education and transformation work for capitalists and their agents, and depend on whether this leadership can effectively promote the progress of the enterprise. As for the amount of state investment, it should be determined according to the national plan and the specific circumstances of the enterprise.
    In joint state-private enterprises, because the socialist component occupies the leading position, some contradictions that could not be solved or further solved by the intermediate forms of state capitalism in terms of public-private relations and labor-capital relations have been solved. However, this fundamental contradiction between the two ownership systems, namely the ownership of the whole people of the means of production and the ownership of capitalists, has not been completely resolved, and needs to be gradually resolved in the future. Joint state-private ownership is a form that facilitates the dual transformation, that is, it facilitates the transformation of capitalist enterprises and the transformation of bourgeois elements, and combines the two transformations to carry out simultaneously. In joint ventures, the operation and management of the enterprise will be continuously transformed and improved, the national plan will be implemented, production will be better developed, and needs will be supplied; the awareness and organization of the masses of workers and staff will be continuously improved; capitalists and their agents will be continuously educated and transformed. Moving forward along this path, the socialist component in joint state-private enterprises will continue to grow, preparing conditions for a calm and proper transformation into socialist enterprises.
    In recent years, under the encouragement and guidance of the People's Government, a considerable number of capitalist industries have been transformed into joint state-private enterprises. The total output value of joint state-private industries in 1953 increased by 8.17 times compared to 1949, but the proportion of the output value of joint state-private industries in the total industrial output value of the country is still very small, that is, it only accounted for 6% in 1953. Calculated by output value, only about 12% of the country's capitalist industries implemented joint state-private ownership in 1953, and the remaining 88% were still privately owned (most of which belong to the intermediate forms of state capitalism). Due to the increasing exposure and development of various insurmountable contradictions in private capitalist enterprises, due to the fact that the original capitalist contradictions in intermediate state capitalist enterprises cannot be handled more effectively, due to the increasingly widespread recognition of the superiority of joint state-private ownership among the people, especially due to the propaganda and education of the general line and general task of the transition period, people have a clearer and clearer understanding of the road of gradually completing the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce through state capitalism. Not only the broad masses of workers and staff in capitalist enterprises enthusiastically demand joint state-private ownership of their enterprises, but also more and more capitalists with vision apply for joint state-private ownership. Under such circumstances, it is necessary and possible for the People's Government to encourage and guide capitalist industrial enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood to transform into joint state-private enterprises in a planned way, step by step, and with distinctions, according to the needs of the country, the possibility of enterprise transformation, and the voluntariness of capitalists, in order to gradually complete the socialist transformation.
    Developing joint state-private ownership is a very complex task, not only because joint ownership involves the relationship between public, private, labor, and capital, but also because each region, each industry, and even each enterprise has special circumstances; therefore, developing joint state-private ownership must adopt a positive and steady approach. In implementing this approach, not only do the relevant departments of the People's Government need to carry out a series of complex tasks, but also the relevant democratic parties and people's organizations need to actively participate in the work. In recent years, in the work of joint state-private ownership, there have been many beneficial experiences that can be concentrated, and at the same time, some policy regulations need to be synthesized. The "Provisional Regulations on Joint State-Private Industrial Enterprises" is mainly a synthesis of these relevant main policies and experiences. With these regulations as a common guideline for public, private, labor, and capital, we believe that the future work of joint state-private ownership will have a sounder development.
    Now, I will briefly explain some of the main policy issues in the regulations as follows:
    First, the implementation of joint state-private ownership of capitalist enterprises should be based on the needs of the country, the possibility of enterprise transformation, and the voluntariness of capitalists. Therefore, the People's Government needs to conduct planned, step-by-step, and differentiated expansion of joint state-private industries. The People's Government encourages and guides capitalists to carry out necessary and possible reforms of their enterprises, preparing the necessary conditions for the implementation of joint ownership. Since joint state-private enterprises are enterprises where the socialist component cooperates with the capitalist component under the direct leadership of the socialist economy, attention should be paid to enlightening and promoting the voluntariness of capitalists. On the one hand, the People's Government and relevant parties should widely and deeply publicize to the capitalists the general task of the state during the transition period and the policy of gradually completing the transformation from capitalism to socialism through state capitalism; on the other hand, joint state-private enterprises should be run seriously, so that capitalists can more universally and deeply recognize the superiority of joint state-private enterprises, thereby enhancing their enthusiasm for implementing joint state-private ownership.
    Second, the implementation of joint state-private ownership of an enterprise should include the original actual property of the enterprise, and no behavior of dispersing assets or evading funds is allowed. The valuation of the original property of the enterprise should be carried out in a fair and reasonable manner, based on facts. For machines that are overage or not overage, their actual remaining usable life can be referred to, and for other properties, their importance to the production of the enterprise should be mainly referred to for appropriate valuation. For stagnant materials and other assets not needed by the joint venture, they can be appropriately discounted through consultation between the public and private parties, or listed as private shares to be disposed of, and continue to be disposed of after the enterprise is jointly owned. The valuation of property should generally be based on current value, but if the result of the property revaluation in 1950 is close to the current value, and the public and private parties agree, it is also possible not to re-inventory, but to use the verified figures of 1950 as the basis, and make necessary adjustments based on asset depreciation and other actual changes. Property inventory and valuation is a very complex task, which is related to the economic accounting and dividend distribution of joint ventures. It should rely on the active participation of trade union organizations and the broad masses of workers and staff to seriously investigate and verify, and at the same time, it should go through full consultation between the public and private parties (if necessary, relevant people's organizations can be invited to send people to participate) to make it as fair and reasonable as possible.
    Third, joint state-private enterprises are led by the public side, and the representatives sent by the competent business authorities of the People's Government and the representatives of the private side are responsible for operation and management. Joint ventures are not ordinary joint-stock enterprises, they are enterprises where the socialist component cooperates with the capitalist component under the direct leadership of the socialist economy. In joint ventures, the public side occupies the leading position, and the private side must accept the leadership of the public side, which is unswervingly determined; at the same time, the legitimate rights and interests of private shares are protected, and the representatives of the private side are also responsible for participating in operation and management. In terms of operation and management, matters related to the public-private relationship should be handled through consultation between representatives of the public and private parties (not limited to personnel directly participating in operation and management), and when disputes arise on major issues, they should be reported to the competent authorities of the People's Government for resolution. If necessary and possible, they can also be submitted to the board of directors of the joint venture for consultation and then reported to the competent authorities of the People's Government for approval. The administrative positions of representatives of the public and private parties in joint ventures are decided by the competent business authorities of the People's Government in consultation with the representatives of the private side, and are appointed accordingly. In terms of the administrative relationship of the enterprise, since the representatives of the private side are also responsible personnel of the enterprise, they should reasonably exercise their powers, perform their duties, and strive to learn and transform themselves under the leadership of the public side; the representatives of the public side should attach importance to the duties of the representatives of the private side, actively and patiently help them make achievements in their work, and gradually transform them in ideology and style. The public representatives of joint ventures and the competent business authorities of joint ventures should be good at closely combining leading the private representatives to reasonably exercise their powers, give play to their skills, and leading them to study and transform themselves. The People's Government adopts the above-mentioned policies for the private representatives in joint ventures, not only because the state protects the legitimate rights and interests of private shares, but more importantly, in the process of socialist transformation of capitalist enterprises, it enables them to re-learn and transform themselves in the practice of production and operation under the direct leadership of the public representatives and the supervision and promotion of the working masses, so that they can make contributions and obtain a glorious future in the socialist transformation and construction cause of the country. If the private representatives have "colluding with the public to benefit the private" or other illegal behaviors, they should be subjected to necessary struggles, and should be dealt with according to law; if there are sabotage production and other counter-revolutionary activities, they should be dealt with severely.
    Fourth, for the original substantive personnel of joint ventures, they should generally be used according to their original circumstances, making the best use of their talents. They should be educated and helped to work conscientiously and actively carry out self-education and self-transformation, striving to contribute more knowledge and talents to national construction. For engineering technicians and other experts, as long as they are "honest in their work, understand their profession and love their profession" (Lenin), they should be fully cherished, their opinions should be valued, they should be helped to correctly exert their expertise, and their self-education should be patiently helped through their production and technical practice, gradually overcoming the influence and habits of the bourgeoisie.
    For substantive personnel who have contributed to the original enterprise but have lost their ability to work, joint ventures can give them appropriate care with reference to the labor insurance regulations or by other means.
    When preparing for joint state-private ownership, some enterprises arbitrarily place private personnel; this behavior should be criticized and prevented.
    If the capitalists' agents before the joint ownership of the enterprise continue to hold substantive positions in the joint venture, if they hold the position of private representative, their problems of birth, old age, sickness, death, injury, and disability shall be given appropriate material security by the joint venture with reference to the standards of the labor insurance regulations, and this expense can be listed as the expense of the joint venture; if they do not hold the position of private representative, they can enjoy the labor insurance benefits of ordinary employees.
    Fifth, as mentioned above, the wage system of capitalist enterprises is generally chaotic and unreasonable. The welfare facilities are also very inconsistent between industries and factories. In enterprises with a lack of welfare facilities, the living and working conditions of workers and staff have not been improved as much as possible. After the implementation of joint state-private ownership of enterprises, it is necessary to gradually reform in this regard and gradually align with comparable state-owned enterprises. However, the reform of the wage system is a very complex issue and is related to the lives of the broad masses of workers and staff. It must be carried out gradually with reference to the original wage and welfare situation of the enterprise, the production and operation situation of the joint venture, and the relevant regulations of state-owned enterprises. It must be carried out gradually with patience after educating the masses of workers and staff and obtaining their consent. It cannot be handled hastily.
    Sixth, as mentioned above, the operation and management system of capitalist enterprises is extremely corrupt and backward, seriously hindering the improvement and development of productive forces. After the implementation of joint state-private ownership of enterprises, it is necessary to reform the old capitalist operation and management system and promote the socialist advanced operation and management system; since the socialist component occupies the leading position in joint ventures, this reform is not only necessary, but also possible. However, since joint ventures are enterprises where the socialist component cooperates with the capitalist component, and since the old operation and management system has had long-term habits, the reform must be carried out steadily and cannot be rushed. On the one hand, it is necessary to rely on the awareness and organization of the working masses and on their bottom-up supervision and participation in management. After an enterprise is jointly owned, it should adopt appropriate forms to implement a system of worker representatives participating in management. On the other hand, it is necessary to fully consult and educate the representatives of the private side. The process of gradually reforming the operation and management of joint ventures is also the process of gradually educating and transforming capitalists and their agents; the capitalist operation and management ideas of the representatives of the private side and other relevant personnel need to be patiently criticized and educated through regular public-private consultation and democratic discussion, and they should be guided and helped to gradually correct them.
    Seventh, the annual profits of joint ventures should be reasonably distributed in three aspects: enterprise public welfare fund, enterprise bonus fund, and shareholders' dividends after paying income tax in accordance with the law. The shareholders' dividends, plus the remuneration of directors, managers, and factory directors, can account for about 25% of the total annual profits. The part distributed to private shares should be disposed of by the private shareholders themselves. After the implementation of joint state-private ownership of enterprises, due to the important changes in production relations and the improvement of production and operation, the profits of enterprises will generally increase compared to the private ownership period; therefore, as a result of distribution according to the above principles, the income of private shares will also increase compared to the private ownership period. However, if a joint venture obtains special preferential treatment from the state, such as raw materials being supplied by the state at allocation prices, but the selling price of the product is not calculated according to the state allocation price, resulting in excess profits, this excess part should be returned to the state. When a joint venture distributes profits, if there have been losses in the past, it should first make up for the losses after paying income tax, and then distribute them according to the above principles; if the losses are large, they can be made up for in installments in order to appropriately take care of the welfare of workers and staff and appropriately pay dividends.
    In existing joint ventures, some individual enterprises have adopted a guaranteed interest method through agreement between the public and private parties, that is, the private shares receive a fixed amount of dividends every year, do not participate in the operation and management of the enterprise, and are not responsible for the profits and losses of the enterprise. If this guaranteed interest method is based on the requirements of the private side and is agreed upon by both the public and private parties through consultation, it should be reported to the People's Government above the provincial or municipal level for approval.
    The public welfare fund of joint ventures should be mainly used for developing production, used in the enterprise in accordance with the national plan, or invested in other joint ventures (including newly built joint ventures), or invested in other private industrial enterprises to implement joint state-private ownership. In the past, some joint ventures used their public welfare funds blindly, causing uneven development of production and waste of construction funds. In the future, in order to meet the requirements of the national plan and prevent waste of funds and uneven development of production, the use of public welfare funds should be subject to the necessary management and guidance by the competent business authorities of the joint venture above the provincial or municipal level. The ownership of the public welfare fund of joint ventures belongs to the joint venture, and the legal income obtained from the investment of the public welfare fund also belongs to the joint venture, but the use of the public welfare fund, whether it is used as working capital and fixed capital for the enterprise, or is invested in other joint state-private enterprises (original or newly built) and private enterprises preparing for joint state-private ownership, should be in accordance with the national plan.
    Eighth, the board of directors of a joint venture is an agency for the public and private parties to negotiate and discuss matters, and its role should be appropriately given play. Joint ventures with a large scale and many shareholders should generally establish a board of directors and hold regular meetings. The number of directors from the public and private parties should be determined through consultation between the two parties. Wholly-owned enterprises or small-scale enterprises with few shareholders may not establish a board of directors after joint state-private ownership, but the important matters related to the public-private relationship stipulated in Article 19 of the Provisional Regulations on Joint State-Private Industrial Enterprises should still be handled through consultation between the representatives of the public and private parties.
    The board of directors of a joint venture may hold regular meetings of private shareholders to report on the work of the board of directors and to negotiate and handle matters related to the rights and interests of private shares. In joint ventures that do not establish a board of directors, the representatives of the public and private parties shall consult to convene a meeting of private shareholders, and the representatives of the public party may attend the meeting and give assistance.
    Joint ventures and their boards of directors shall bear the responsibility of educating and transforming private shareholders. The meeting of private shareholders is one of the important forms for joint ventures and their boards of directors to contact private shareholders and educate them. The board of directors and the representatives of the public and private parties should carry out work through shareholders' meetings or shareholder forums, pay attention to their demands and opinions, and educate them with the practice of enterprise transformation, so that they can gradually be transformed in the process of socialist transformation.
    The above is some explanation of the "Provisional Regulations on Joint State-Private Industrial Enterprises". I request the Government Administration Council to pass this regulation and promulgate it. September 2, 1954

    关于“公私合营工业企业暂行条例”的说明
    中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会副主任　李维汉总理：
    现在将“公私合营工业企业暂行条例”提请政务院审核。
    对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，是国家在过渡时期的总任务的重要组成部分。国家对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造，是鼓励和指导它们转变为各种不同形式的国家资本主义经济；逐步以全民所有制代替资本家所有制。由于几年来实行国家资本主义政策的经验，特别由于过渡时期的总路线和总任务的教育，人们愈来愈认识到：经过国家资本主义的不同形式逐步完成对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，是较健全的方针和办法。
    资本主义工业，经过国家几年来的利用、限制和改造，大部分已经转变为各种中级形式（加工、订货、统购、包销）的国家资本主义经济。据中央工商行政管理局统计，北京、天津、沈阳、上海、武汉、广州、重庆、西安八大城市私营大型工业一九五四年第一季度的总产值中，加工、订货、统购、包销的产值占百分之八十六·四。经过国家资本主义的各种中级形式，国家逐步地加强了对大部分资本主义工业的原料供应和产品销售的掌握，在不同程度上将它们的生产纳入国家计划的轨道，在不同程度上限制着它们的生产无政府状态的破坏作用，发挥了它们的有利于国计民生的积极作用。经过这些形式，一部分企业中的共产党组织和工会组织对于生产的领导和监督加强了，或多或少地促进了这些企业的各项改革。经过这些形式，企业中工人群众的劳动主要地是为国家的需要而生产，只有较小部分是为资本家的利润而生产，这就使工人群众对自己的劳动感到有兴趣，他们的劳动生产率因此提高了一步。经过这些形式，企业中的资本家不仅能够分得合理的利润，并且更为直接地受到爱国守法和服从国营经济领导的教育。由此可见，国家资本主义的中级形式是国家对资本主义工业进行利用、限制和改造的重要步骤，它在一定时期以内在发展生产、供应需要上，在为这些企业向国家资本主义的高级形式发展准备条件上，都起了相当重要的作用。国家经济工作人员、资本主义企业中的工人和职员、资本家和资本家代理人，都应当继续为更好地完成国家的加工、订货、统购、包销任务而积极努力。
    但是，资本主义工业在转变为国家资本主义中级形式以后，企业仍是资本家所有，企业的经营管理仍是按照资本主义的方式，因此，公私矛盾、劳资矛盾和其他许多矛盾都不能获得更有效的处理。在公私关系上，虽然有一部分资本家在人民政府和国营经济的领导下能够服从国家的利益，在完成加工、订货、统购、包销任务的过程中表现了他们的积极性，但有很多资本家则不是采取这种态度，而还是采取唯利是图的态度。他们虽然接受了加工、订货、统购、包销，但不按照国家的要求、也即是不按量、按质、按时间完成任务。同时，他们不关心经营管理的改善和技术的改进，以致产品质量很低，成本很高，浪费十分严重，有些在自销的时候是名牌货的，在国家包销以后，竟因质量降低变成滞销货。还有许多资本家继续进行偷工减料、以坏顶好、虚报成本等违法活动。部分资本家用增加工资的办法笼络少数落后职工，并借以提高工缴利润。部分资本家甚至采取各种方法进行抗拒。此外，资本主义的经营管理方式妨碍着国家对于企业生产能力的统计和利用，因此，一方面使企业的生产潜力不能得到适当发挥，另一方面又造成生产上的某些盲目混乱。在劳资关系上，资本主义的腐败的经营管理方式以及由此产生的工资制度、工时制度的混乱状态，日益成为提高职工群众的劳动热情和生产革新精神的严重障碍，并且对这些企业的生产起着很大的消极作用，对国营工厂的工资制度、工时制度和工人阶级内部的团结等方面，也发生了极其不利的影响。这些矛盾的存在和发展，限制了企业劳动生产率的提高和社会生产力的发展，也限制了对资本家和资本家代理人的教育和改造。这样，便需要将这些工业由国家资本主义中级形式逐步发展为高级形式，即公私合营形式。
    当国家资本主义中级形式或者一般资本主义企业转变为公私合营的时候，企业的生产关系就要发生下列重要的变化：（一）企业由私有改变为公私共有，社会主义成分在企业内部同资本主义成分合作并且居于领导地位。在合营企业中，私人股份的合法权益依然存在并且受到保护，但资本家处于公方领导之下，改变了他们在私营时期支配企业的地位。（二）合营企业的经营管理不再采取资本主义方式，而将逐步向国营企业看齐，完全以发展生产、保证需要和国家计划的要求为指导方针。这就是说，社会主义基本经济法则和国民经济有计划发展的法则，将在合营企业内起直接的作用。许多企业在公私合营以后根本改变了经营管理方针，使企业的生产符合国家的需要，并使企业状况得到重大的改进。例如：民生公司在公私合营以前非高价不接受国家的运粮任务，宁愿船驳放空，压沙填水；公私合营以后降低运价为国家运粮，使川粮大量外运，同时也发挥了船驳的运输潜力，推动了增产节约运动，使企业由亏损累累变为有盈余。（三）工人在企业中的地位改变了，公方和职工群众结合一起居于企业的领导地位；因此，职工群众对待企业采取了主人翁的态度，劳动积极性和劳动生产率大大提高。在筹备公私合营的过程中，许多企业的职工和技术人员欢欣鼓舞地用自己劳动的积极性和创造性迎接企业的合营。例如上海信谊药厂的工人为迎接公私合营，以九天的时间重建了大炉（以前拆砌一次大炉要三个月的时间），技术人员也试制成功抗结核菌的药品。天津北洋纱厂在筹备合营过程中，工人群众月月都超额完成生产计划，并且积极协助财产清估工作；为了使国家投资增装的八千八百枚纱锭早日投入生产，他们更加发挥了劳动积极性和创造性，不断提高工作效率，提前完成了安装工作。（四）资本家和资本家代理人得到公方直接、经常的领导和教育，得到职工群众的帮助和监督，因而有可能在实践中学习新事物和新思想，逐步改造自己，正确地发挥他们的才能和积极作用。
  （五）在盈余分配上，企业利润除小部分用来发付股息红利和适当改善职工福利外，大部分可以根据国家计划，用于发展生产。由于企业在公私合营以后，经营管理改善，职工劳动热情提高，企业利润一般较私营时增加，可以积累更多的资金，用来扩大生产。例如唐山华新纱厂在公私合营的五年间，不但给股东发付了股息红利，而且扩充了生产设备，这些新扩充的生产设备，差不多等于合营前三十年间投资建设的一倍。
    企业生产关系上所发生的如上的重要变化，使公私合营企业成为半社会主义性质的企业，具有为国家资本主义中级形式不能比拟的优越性。合营企业的这种半社会主义性质和它的优越性，是同社会主义成分本身的优越性及其在企业中的领导地位和领导作用分不开的。合营企业发挥了社会主义成分的优越性和社会主义成分的领导作用，就能正确地团结职工提高劳动生产率，就能有效地教育资本家和资本家代理人接受经营管理的改革，就能提高产品的质量、降低产品的成本、并且根据国家的需要和可能增加产品的数量，同时也就使企业获得较多的利润、积累资金、扩大再生产，使职工生活获得必要的改善，而且也使资本家有合理的利润可得。国家对企业实行公私合营，要投入必需的资金，这就同私人股份形成一定的公私股份比例，但社会主义成分在合营企业中的领导地位和领导作用以及这种领导地位和领导作用的不断增强，不是取决于国家投资的数量，而是取决于国家政权的性质和社会主义经济在国民经济中的地位，取决于企业中公方代表同职工群众的结合和他们对于资本家及其代理人的教育改造工作，取决于这种领导能够确实地推动企业向前进步。至于国家投资多少，则要根据国家的计划和企业的具体情况决定。
    在公私合营企业中，由于社会主义成分居于领导地位，解决了或者进一步解决了国家资本主义中级形式在公私关系上和劳资关系上所不能解决的某些矛盾。但两种所有制即生产资料的全民所有制和资本家所有制间的这个根本矛盾，还没有完全解决，需要在以后逐步加以解决，公私合营是便利于进行双重改造的形式，即便利于改造资本主义企业和改造资产阶级分子，并使两种改造结合起来同时进行的形式。在合营企业中，将不断地改造和改善企业的经营管理，贯彻国家的计划，更好地发展生产，供应需要；不断地提高职工群众的觉悟性和组织性；不断地教育、改造资本家和资本家代理人。循此前进，公私合营企业中的社会主义成分将不断增长，为从容地和妥善地转变为社会主义企业准备条件。
    几年来，在人民政府的鼓励和指导下，资本主义工业转变为公私合营企业的已有相当数量。一九五三年公私合营工业的总产值较一九四九年增加了八·一七倍，但公私合营工业的产值在全国工业总产值中的比重还是很小的，即如一九五三年也还只占百分之六。全国的资本主义工业，按产值计算，
  一九五三年还只有百分之十二左右实行了公私合营，其余的百分之八十八左右还是私营的（其中大部分属于国家资本主义中级形式）。由于私人资本主义企业中的种种不可克服的矛盾日益暴露和日益发展，由于国家资本主义中级形式企业中资本主义原有的矛盾不能获得更有效的处理，由于公私合营的优越性在人们中间获得日益广泛的认识，特别是由于过渡时期总路线和总任务的宣传教育，使人们对于经过国家资本主义逐步完成对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的道路，有了愈来愈清楚的认识，不但资本主义企业中的广大职工群众热烈地要求对他们的企业实行公私合营，就是有眼光的资本家中也有愈来愈多的人申请公私合营。在这样的情况下，人民政府就有必要和可能依据国家的需要、企业改造的可能和资本家的自愿，有计划地鼓励和指导有利于国计民生的资本主义工业企业转变为公私合营企业，以逐步完成社会主义改造。
    发展公私合营，是一件十分复杂的工作，这不仅因为合营牵涉到公、私、劳、资等各个方面的关系，而且由于各地各业以至每个企业都有特殊的情况；因此，发展公私合营，必须采取积极的和稳步的方针。在执行这个方针时，不仅人民政府的有关部门需要进行一系列的复杂的工作，同时需要有关的民主党派和人民团体积极地参加工作。几年来，在公私合营的工作中，有了不少的有益经验可以集中起来，同时也有一些政策性的规定需要综合起来。“公私合营工业企业暂行条例”主要就是这些有关的主要政策和经验的综合。有了这一条例作为公、私、劳、资等方面的共同准则，我们相信今后的公私合营工作一定会有更健全的发展。
    现在将条例中几个主要政策问题概略地加以说明如下：
    第一、对资本主义企业实行公私合营，应当根据国家的需要、企业改造的可能和资本家的自愿。因此，人民政府对扩展公私合营工业需要有计划、有步骤、有区别地进行。人民政府鼓励和指导资本家们对自己的企业进行必要和可能的改革，为实行合营准备必要的条件。公私合营企业既然是社会主义经济直接领导下的社会主义成分同资本主义成分合作的企业，就应当注意启发和促进资本家的自愿。这在一方面要由人民政府和有关方面向资本家们广泛、深入地宣传国家在过渡时期的总任务和经过国家资本主义逐步完成由资本主义到社会主义的改造的方针；在另一方面，要认真办好公私合营企业，使资本家们更加普遍、深刻地认识公私合营企业的优越性，从而增强对于实行公私合营的积极性。
    第二、企业实行公私合营，应当包括企业原来的实有财产，不容许有任何分散资产、逃避资金的行为。对企业原有财产的估价，应当根据公平合理的原则，实事求是地进行。对逾龄或未逾龄机器可以参酌其实际尚可使用年限，对其他财产主要参酌其对企业生产作用的大小，进行适当估价。对于呆滞材料和其他为合营企业所不需要的资产，可经公私双方协商，打适当折扣，或列作私股的待处理财产，俟企业合营后继续加以处理。财产的估价一般应以现值为标准，但如果一九五○年重估财产的结果接近现值，并经公私双方同意，也可以不重新清估，即以一九五○年的核定数字为基础，根据资产折旧和其他实际变动情况作必要的调整。清产估价是一件十分复杂的工作，关系到合营企业的经济核算和股息红利的分配，应当依靠工会组织和广大职工群众的积极参加，认真地清查核实，同时应当经过公私双方充分协商（必要时可以邀请有关的人民团体派人参加），尽可能地做到公平合理。
    第三、公私合营企业受公方领导，由人民政府主管业务机关所派代表同私方代表负责经营管理。合营企业不是普通的合股企业，它是社会主义经济直接领导下的、社会主义成分同资本主义成分合作的企业。在合营企业中，公方居于领导地位，私方要接受公方的领导，这是确定不移的；同时，私股的合法权益受到保护，私方代表也负责参加经营管理。在经营管理方面，有关公私关系的问题，应当由公私双方代表（不限于直接参加经营管理的人员）协商处理，在重大问题上发生争议时，应当报请人民政府主管机关解决，如果有必要和可能，也可以提交合营企业的董事会协商后报请人民政府主管机关核定。公私双方代表在合营企业中的行政职务，由人民政府主管业务机关同私方代表协商决定，并且加以任命。在企业行政关系上，私方代表既然也是企业的负责人员，就应当在公方领导之下合理地行使其职权，守职尽责，并努力学习，改造自己；公方代表则应当重视私方代表的职责，积极地、耐心地帮助他们在工作上作出成绩，并使他们在思想上、作风上逐步获得改造。合营企业的公方代表和合营企业的主管业务机关，都要善于把领导私方代表合理地行使职权、发挥技能和领导他们进行学习和自我改造密切地结合起来。人民政府对于合营企业中的私方代表采取上述各项政策，不仅是因为国家保护私股的合法权益，更重要的是要在对资本主义企业进行社会主义改造过程中使他们在公方代表的直接领导下和工人群众的监督、推动下，在生产经营的实践中重新学习、改造自己，从而使他们在国家的社会主义改造和建设事业中，能够有所贡献，并获得光荣的前途。如果私方代表有“合公营私”或其他违法行为，则应当对他们进行必要的斗争，并且应当依法处理；如果有破坏生产和其他反革命活动，更应从严处理。
    第四、合营企业对于企业原有的实职人员，一般应当参酌他们原来的情况量材使用，使他们各得其所。应当教育和帮助他们认真地工作，积极地进行自我教育和自我改造，争取为国家建设贡献更多的知识和才能。对于工程技术人员和其他专门家，只要他们“诚实工作，通晓本业并酷爱本业”（列宁），就应当充分加以爱护，重视他们的意见，帮助他们正确地发挥专长，并且通过他们的生产和技术的实践，耐心地帮助他们进行自我教育，逐步克服资产阶级的影响和习惯。
    合营企业对于在原企业中有劳绩但已丧失工作能力的实职人员，可以参照劳保条例或采用其他办法，给以适当照顾。
    有些企业在准备公私合营的时候，资本家任意安置私人；对于这种行为，应当加以批判和防止。
    企业合营前的资本家代理人继续在合营企业中担任实职的，如果担任了私方代表，他们的生、老、病、死、伤、残等问题，由合营企业比照劳保条例的标准给以适当的物质保障，这项费用可列作合营企业的开支；如果不是担任私方代表，可以享受一般职工的劳保待遇。
    第五、资本主义企业的工资制度，如前所述，一般都是混乱的、不合理的。福利设施在各业各厂之间也很不一致，福利设施缺乏的企业中，职工的生活条件和工作条件未能得到可能的改善。企业实行公私合营以后，必须在这方面逐步进行改革，逐步向相当的国营企业看齐。但工资制度的改革是一个十分复杂并关系广大职工生活的问题，必须参酌企业原来的工资福利情况、合营企业的生产经营情况和国营企业的有关规定，在企业改革和生产改进的过程中，经过对职工群众的耐心教育，取得他们的同意，逐步进行，不可急躁处理。
    第六、资本主义企业的经营管理制度，如前所述，带着极大的腐败性和落后性，严重地阻碍着生产力的提高和发展。企业实行公私合营以后，必须改革旧的资本主义的经营管理制度，推行社会主义的先进的经营管理制度；由于社会主义成分在合营企业中居于领导地位，这种改革不仅是必要的，而且是可能的。但由于合营企业是社会主义成分同资本主义成分合作的企业，而且由于旧的经营管理制度有了长期的习惯，在进行改革时，必须是稳步前进，不可急躁从事。一方面，要倚靠工人群众的觉悟性和组织性，倚靠他们的自下的监督和自上的参加管理。企业公私合营后，应当采取适当的形式，实行工人代表参加管理的制度。另一方面，要对私方代表进行充分的协商和教育。合营企业在经营管理上逐步进行改革的过程，也就是逐步教育、改造资本家和资本家代理人的过程；对于私方代表及其他有关人员的资本主义的经营管理思想，需要通过经常的公私协商和民主讨论，耐心地进行批判和教育，指导和帮助他们逐步改正。
    第七、合营企业每年的利润，在依法缴纳所得税后，应当就企业公积金，企业奖励金和股东股息红利三个方面，加以合理分配。股东的股息红利，加上董事、经理和厂长等人的酬劳金，共可占到全年盈余总额的百分之二十五左右。其中私股分得的部分，应当听私股股东自行支配。企业实行公私合营以后，由于生产关系有了重要的改变，由于生产经营的改进，企业利润一般会比私营的时候增多；因此，依照上述原则进行分配的结果，私股所得也会比私营的时候增多。但合营企业如果获得国家的特殊优待，例如原料由国家按照调拨价格供应，但产品的售价并未按照国家调拨价格计算，因而产生了超额利润，这个超额部分应当缴还国家。合营企业分配盈余的时候，如果过去有了亏损，应当在缴纳所得税以后先弥补亏损，然后依照上述原则进行分配；如果亏损较大，可以分年弥补，以便适当照顾职工福利和适当发付股息红利。
    现有的合营企业中，有个别企业经公私双方协议，采取保息的办法，即私股方面每年领取定额的股息，不参加企业的经营管理，也不负企业盈亏的责任。采取这种保息办法，如果是出于私股方面的要求，经过公私双方协商同意后，应当报请省、直辖市以上人民政府批准。
    合营企业的公积金，应当以发展生产为主要用途，依照国家的计划用于本企业，或者投资于其他合营企业（包括新建合营企业），或者投资于其他私营工业企业以实行公私合营。过去有些合营企业对公积金的使用，带有盲目性，造成生产发展的不均衡和建设资金的浪费。今后，为要做到适应国家计划的要求、防止资金浪费和生产发展的不均衡现象，公积金的使用应当由合营企业的省、直辖市以上主管业务机关加以必要的管理和指导。合营企业公积金的所有权属于合营企业，由公积金投资取得的合法收益亦归合营企业所有，但公积金的使用，不论是用于本企业作为流动资金和固定资金，或者是投资于其他公私合营企业（原有或新建）和准备进行公私合营的私营企业，都应当服从国家计划。
    第八、合营企业的董事会是公私双方协商议事的机关，应当适当的发挥它的作用。规模较大、股东较多的合营企业，一般应当设立董事会，并应当定期开会，公私双方董事名额，由双方协商规定。独资企业或者规模小股东少的企业，在公私合营以后可以不设立董事会，但公私合营工业企业暂行条例第十九条所规定的有关公私关系的重要事项，仍应当由公私双方代表协商处理。
    合营企业董事会可以定期召开私股股东会议，报告董事会的工作，协商处理私股之间的权益事项。在不设立董事会的合营企业中，由公私双方代表协商召开私股股东会议，公方代表可以参加会议，给以帮助。
    合营企业和它的董事会，应当担负教育和改造私股股东的责任。私股股东会议是合营企业和它的董事会联系私股股东并向他们进行教育的重要形式之一。董事会和公私双方代表都应当通过股东会议或股东座谈会等方式进行工作，注意他们的要求和意见，并用企业改造的实践来教育他们，使他们在社会主义改造的过程中逐步获得改造。
    以上是关于“公私合营工业企业暂行条例”的一些说明，请求政务院通过这个条例，并予以公布。一九五四年九月二日
