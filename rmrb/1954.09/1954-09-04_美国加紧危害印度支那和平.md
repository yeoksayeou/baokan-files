    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 2nd: While actively establishing the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, the United States is carrying out a series of conspiracies to endanger peace in Indochina.
    According to a Washington dispatch in the "Indian Times" of August 31st, dated August 30th, the United States government has decided to double the current 260,000-strong army of Bảo Đại and to force the French army to leave behind the military equipment supplied to it by the United States, in order to train and equip the Bảo Đại puppet army. American officials in Washington said: the French army has a large amount of military equipment in storage, and the French army must hand over this military equipment to the Bảo Đại army.
    The report also mentioned that the United States is continuing to lure residents of North Vietnam to move to the areas under Bảo Đại's rule. The United States has begun to take direct action to achieve this goal. Starting from August 30th, the United States Navy has begun to transport many North Vietnamese residents from Haiphong to Saigon. The United States has decided to establish concentration camps "in the sparsely populated highlands between Saigon and Hue" to house these people, directly managed by the United States, and train them to serve American political and military purposes.
    The report pointed out that the U.S. Foreign Operations Administration has decided to strengthen its so-called "health, education, and public works programs" in the areas under Bảo Đại's rule, preparing to send its agents from there to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to carry out sabotage. To achieve this goal, the United States has allocated all necessary funds from the $700 million in "foreign aid program" earmarked for Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific region.

    美国加紧危害印度支那和平
    【新华社新德里二日电】美国在积极建立东南亚侵略集团的同时，正在进行一系列的阴谋来危害印度支那的和平。
    据“印度时报”八月三十一日刊载八月三十日的华盛顿消息说，美国政府已经决定把保大目前二十六万人的军队扩充一倍，并且强迫法军把美国供给它的军事装备留下来，以便用来训练和装备保大伪军。华盛顿的美国官员们说：法军存有大批的军事装备，法军必须把这批军事装备交给保大军队。
    这个消息又谈到美国在继续诱骗北越居民搬到保大统治区去。美国为了达到这种目的已经开始直接采取行动。美国海军从八月三十日起已经开始把许多北越居民从海防运到西贡去。美国决定“在西贡和顺化之间的人口稀少的高原地区”建立收容这些人的集中营，由美国直接管理，并对他们加以训练，以便使他们为美国的政治和军事目的服务。
    消息指出：美国援外事务管理署已经决定加强它在保大统治区的所谓“卫生、教育和公共工程的计划”，准备由此派遣它的特务到越南民主共和国去进行破坏。为了达到这种目的，美国已经从“援外计划”中用于东南亚和西太平洋区域的七亿美元里拨出一切必要的款项。
