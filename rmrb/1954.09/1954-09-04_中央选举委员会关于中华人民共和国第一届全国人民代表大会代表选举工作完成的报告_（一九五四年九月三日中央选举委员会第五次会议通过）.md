    After the Central Election Commission and the State Council of the Central People's Government issued the "Decision on Several Issues Concerning the Convening of Provincial, Municipal, and County People's Congresses" on April 15, 1954, all 150 municipalities under the jurisdiction of provinces, 2,064 counties, autonomous counties, and county-level units, and 170 districts of municipalities directly under the Central Government held people's congresses in June and July. Some prefectural and county-level units in minority areas where grassroots elections were temporarily not held also convened people's representative conferences. In these meetings, in accordance with the provisions of the "Election law of the National People's Congress and Local People's Congresses of the People's Republic of China," deputies to the people's congresses of provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, totaling 16,680 people, were elected by secret ballot.

    From the end of July to mid-August 1954, the people's congresses of the provinces, municipalities, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region were convened successively. In these meetings, in addition to discussing the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China and reviewing government work reports, deputies to the National People's Congress were elected separately. In Tibet and the Qamdo area, the form of a representative conference was adopted to elect deputies to the National People's Congress. A total of 1,136 deputies to the National People's Congress were elected from 25 provinces, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Tibet, the Qamdo area, and 14 municipalities directly under the Central Government. The army convened a military representative conference and elected 60 deputies to the National People's Congress. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, at an enlarged overseas Chinese affairs conference attended by overseas Chinese representatives, elected 30 deputies to the National People's Congress.

    In total, 1,226 deputies to the National People's Congress were produced in various regions and units (list attached separately). In addition, the Taiwan Province should elect deputies to the National People's Congress, but the quota is temporarily vacant because the province has yet to be liberated.

    Among the deputies to the National People's Congress, 147 are women deputies, accounting for 11.99% of the total number of deputies; in addition to the 150 minority nationality deputies stipulated in the election law, 27 were also elected by various provinces and cities, accounting for 14.44% of the total number of deputies. Representatives of all nationalities and strata have representatives commensurate with their status in the total number of deputies.

    Now, the election of deputies to the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China has been fully completed. The work of the Central Election Commission is hereby concluded.
