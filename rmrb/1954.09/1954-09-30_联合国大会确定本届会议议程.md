Xinhua News Agency, New York, 29th: The United Nations General Assembly's ninth session concluded its discussion of the session's agenda on the 25th, adopting an agenda comprising sixty-seven proposals.

    Among the proposals included in the agenda of the current session that have attracted public attention are: the Korean question, the report of the Disarmament Commission, the question of admitting new member states to the United Nations, the Tunisian question, the Moroccan question, Burma's complaint of aggression by the Kuomintang Group, the economic development of underdeveloped countries, technical assistance programs, as well as the newly proposed West Irian question, the Cyprus question, and international cooperation in the development of atomic energy for peaceful uses.

    The General Committee met on the 22nd and 23rd to examine and approve the various proposals submitted by the Secretary-General of the United Nations. It held another meeting on the afternoon of the 24th, approving the inclusion of the proposal newly submitted by the US delegation on "International Cooperation in the Development of Atomic Energy for Peaceful Uses" on the General Assembly's agenda.

    The General Assembly plenary sessions discussed and decided on the General Assembly's agenda and the methods of assigning the various proposals on the agenda to the committees for consideration on the 24th and 25th.

    In the General Assembly plenary session, a fierce debate unfolded regarding whether to include the West Irian question and the Cyprus question on the agenda. Representatives of colonial countries (Netherlands, Britain, France, Australia) attempted to prevent the inclusion of the West Irian question on the agenda in both the General Committee meeting and the plenary session, but they were unsuccessful. The General Assembly adopted the inclusion of this issue on the agenda with 39 votes in favor, 12 votes against, and 9 abstentions. The British representative, as well as representatives from France and Turkey, who supported him, opposed the inclusion of the Cyprus question on the agenda. The General Assembly adopted the inclusion of the Cyprus question on the agenda with 30 votes in favor, 19 votes against, and 11 abstentions. Thus, the activities of the colonial countries to prevent the inclusion of these two issues on the agenda were defeated.

    The Soviet representative stated in both the General Committee meeting and the General Assembly plenary session that the question of admitting Laos and Cambodia to the United Nations should not be reviewed during the current session until the political issues in Indochina were completely resolved. However, the General Assembly adopted the inclusion of this issue on the agenda by a majority vote. Representatives of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries abstained during the vote.

    Any proposal temporarily submitted by a national delegation in the future requesting inclusion on the General Assembly's agenda can still be included if it is approved by the General Assembly.

    联合国大会确定本届会议议程
    【新华社二十九日讯】纽约消息：联合国大会第九届会议在二十五日结束了关于本届会议议程的讨论，确定了一个包括六十七个议案的议程。
    列入本届会议议程的、受到公众注意的议案有：朝鲜问题、裁军委员会的报告、准许新会员国加入联合国问题、突尼斯问题、摩洛哥问题、缅甸控诉国民党集团侵略问题、落后国家经济发展问题、技术援助计划等，以及在本届会议上新提出来的西伊里安问题、塞浦路斯问题和在发展原子能和平用途方面的国际合作问题。
    总务委员会在二十二日、二十三日开会审议并且通过了联合国秘书长所提各个议案。在二十四日下午又举行会议，通过了把美国代表团新提出来的
  “在发展原子能和平用途方面的国际合作”这一议案列入大会议程。
    大会全体会议在二十四日、二十五日讨论并决定了大会议程以及把议程上的各个议案分配给各委员会审议的办法。
    在大会全体会议上，环绕着是否把西伊里安问题和塞浦路斯问题列入议程的问题展开了激烈的争论。殖民国家（荷兰、英国、法国、澳大利亚）的代表在总务委员会会议和全体会议上都企图阻止把西伊里安问题列入议程，但是没有能够成功。大会以三十九票赞成、十二票反对、九票弃权通过把这个问题列入议程。英国代表以及支持他的法国、土耳其等国代表，反对把塞浦路斯问题列入议程。大会以三十票赞成、十九票反对、十一票弃权通过把塞浦路斯问题列入议程。这样，殖民国家阻止把这两个问题列入议程的活动都遭到了挫败。
    苏联代表在总务委员会会议和大会全体会议上都提出：在印度支那的政治问题没有得到完全解决以前，在本届会议上不应该审查关于准许老挝和柬埔寨加入联合国的问题。但是，大会以多数票通过把这一问题列入议程。苏联和人民民主国家的代表在表决时弃权。
    任何国家代表团以后临时提出要求列入大会议程的议案，如果得到大会的通过，仍然可以列入议程。
