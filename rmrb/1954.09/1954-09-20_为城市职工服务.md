    Serving Urban Workers
    Ma Shifen, Representative to the National People's Congress, Deputy Director of the Shenyang Consumer Cooperative

    Shenyang is one of China's important industrial cities, the center of the national machine manufacturing industry. The Shenyang Consumer Cooperative bears the glorious task of ensuring the timely supply of consumer goods to the vast number of workers.

    The Shenyang Consumer Cooperative was established in 1949 and has been in operation for over five years. To date, the city has established 260 primary-level cooperatives (including 95 in the rural suburbs), with membership reaching 630,000. The consumer cooperative has 509 retail units (stores) directly supplying workers. In recent years, the supply of goods to workers and citizens has increased rapidly. The total turnover of goods in the first half of 1954 increased by 9.7 times compared to the same period in 1950. These figures illustrate the general development of the consumer cooperative.

    The Shenyang Consumer Cooperative, noting the characteristic of a large number of workers in big cities, has strengthened the supply of essential goods to meet the growing needs of workers throughout the city. In the supply of goods, the cooperative regularly conducts surveys of members' purchasing power and uses out-of-stock registers and members' opinion books to solicit consumers' opinions and requests extensively, continuously improving its operations. To facilitate workers' shopping, the cooperative universally implemented a "rotating day off" and "continuous shift system," ensuring regular business on Sundays and extending daily business hours on weekdays. Many consumer cooperatives have implemented an "order system" for festival goods or seasonal goods, allowing workers to purchase desired goods through appointments.

    Based on the rising trend of people's lives and the gradual increase in demand for non-staple foods from the vast number of workers, the city's consumer cooperatives vigorously carried out the supply of non-staple foods starting in 1952. Now, all primary-level cooperatives in the city operate non-staple foods, with most cooperatives supplying dried and fresh vegetables, fish, meat, and various seasonings. The purchase of these non-staple foods is achieved through signing supply and marketing contracts and establishing supply and marketing relationships with organized farmers, which not only ensures the source of goods but also keeps prices generally lower than those in the free market. According to a 1953 survey of members' purchasing power, Li Shichun, a worker at the Heavy Machinery Plant with a salary of 350 points, spent 250 points at the cooperative, saving 50,000 yuan compared to the free market. Comparing the goods supplied by the cooperative with the prices of goods in the free market, the cooperative has saved a total of over 50 billion yuan for the vast number of workers and consumers in recent years.

    With the increase in people's purchasing power and the development of cooperative business, various consumer cooperatives have also established many affiliated enterprises and welfare services for members. To date, there are 89 sewing departments, with tailoring fees for members 20% lower than those of private merchants; 34 barber shops, with haircuts for members 30% lower than market prices. Consumer cooperatives located far from the city center have established cooperative affiliated departments such as bathhouses, watch repair, engraving, shoe repair, and bicycle repair to take care of the daily needs of workers, which have been supported and welcomed by workers.

    Under the business policy of serving production and serving life, the Shenyang Consumer Cooperative has established 29 service departments for basic construction sites and three construction site cooperatives since 1952, as well as a mobile supply station, directly supplying materials to basic construction workers.

    Although the Shenyang Consumer Cooperative has achieved certain development and achievements, there are still many shortcomings in its work. Our understanding of workers' needs is not sufficient, and our business management, especially financial work, is still weak. All of our staff are determined to work hard, overcome shortcomings, and strive to fulfill the historical mission of consumer cooperation in the transitional period of the country.

    为城市职工服务
    全国人民代表大会代表  沈阳市消费合作社副主任  马世芬
    沈阳市是我国的重要工业城市之一，是全国机器制造业的中心，沈阳市消费合作社担负着保证及时供应广大职工消费需要的光荣任务。
    沈阳市消费合作社从一九四九年开始建立到现在已五年多了。到目前为止，全市已经建立二百六十个基层社（包括市郊农村的九十五个），社员发展到六十三万人，消费合作社所属直接供应职工的零售单位（门市部）有五百零九个。几年来供应职工和市民的商品增加很快，商品流转总额一九五四年上半年较一九五○年同时期增加九点七倍。从这些数字中就可以看出消费合作社发展的概貌了。
    沈阳市消费合作社注意到大城市职工多的特点，加强了组织生活品的供应，以满足全市职工日益增长的需要。在商品供应中经常进行社员购买力调查，并利用柜台缺货登记簿和社员意见簿，广泛征求消费者意见和要求，不断改进业务。并且还尽量照顾到职工购买东西的方便，普遍实行了“轮休日”和“连带上班制”，做到了星期日照常营业，平时也能延长每日的营业时间。很多消费合作社对节日商品或对季节性商品实行了“订货制”，通过预约的办法，使职工能买到可心的商品。
    根据人民生活上升的趋势和广大职工对副食品要求的逐渐提高，从一九五二年开始，全市消费合作社大力开展了副食品的供应工作。现在全市基层社都经营副食品，绝大部分的合作社供应干、鲜菜、鱼、肉和各种调味品，这些副食品的收购是通过签订供销合同和组织起来的农民建立供销关系，不但保证了货源。并且价格普遍低于自由市场。据一九五三年社员购买力的调查，重型机器厂工人李世春工薪三百五十分，在合作社用去二百五十分，比自由市场可节省五万元。如果把合作社供应的商品和自由市场价格的商品相比较，几年来就给广大职工和消费者节省了约计五百多亿元。
    随着人民购买力的提高和合作社业务的发展，各消费合作社还兴办了不少附属企业与社员的福利事业，到目前已有八十九个缝纫部，社员作衣服加工费低于私商百分之二十；理发部三十四个，社员理发低于市价百分之三十。距市区较远的职工消费合作社为照顾职工日常生活所需，建立了浴池、修表、刻字、修理鞋、修理自行车等合作社附属部门，得到职工的拥护与欢迎。
    在为生产为生活服务的经营方针下，沈阳市消费合作社自一九五二年起到现在已建立了基本建设工地服务部二十九个，工地合作社三个，此外还有流动供应站一处，直接对基本建设职工进行物资供应。
    沈阳市消费合作社虽然有一定的发展和成绩，但在工作中还是有许多缺点的，我们对职工需要的了解还不够，经营管理上特别是财务工作还很薄弱。我们全体职工决心努力工作，克服缺点，为完成消费合作在国家的过渡时期的历史任务而奋斗。
