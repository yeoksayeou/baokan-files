The Ministry of Forestry of the Central People's Government convened a National Forest Protection Work Symposium from August 27th to September 3rd. Over sixty representatives from provinces, cities, autonomous regions, key forest area prefectures, counties, banners, and other units attended the meeting. Comrade Sergeyev, Chief Advisor of the Ministry of Forestry and a Soviet expert, also attended the meeting and provided a detailed introduction to the advanced Soviet experiences in forest fire prevention, pest and disease control.

The meeting summarized the forest protection work of the past few years, and concluded that under the leadership of Party committees and people's governments at all levels, certain achievements had been made in forest fire prevention and pest and disease control in forest areas across the country, and the losses from forest disasters have been decreasing year by year. For example, in 1952, bamboo locusts in Hunan Province damaged 120,000 mu of bamboo forests, which has been reduced to more than 50,000 mu this year. The current shortcomings in forest protection work are mainly the lack of safe and effective fire prevention measures in the large areas of state-owned forest areas with sparse populations and obstructed transportation. Insufficient attention is also being paid to forest protection work in natural forest areas in minority areas and private forest areas in the South. Therefore, the meeting requested that all localities continue to implement the spirit of "prevention is better than cure," extensively use various methods to vigorously carry out forest protection work, and reduce the losses from forest disasters to the minimum. According to the working conditions of various regions and the characteristics of forest areas, the meeting clarified the central tasks of forest protection work in the future: In the Northeast and Inner Mongolia forest areas, in addition to continuing to implement various effective systems and strengthening aerial patrol work, it is necessary to focus on strengthening the protection of large areas of state-owned forest areas with sparse populations and obstructed transportation, and gradually establish necessary permanent safety measures; North China, Northwest China, and Shandong, Henan and other provinces should cooperate with the national comprehensive water conservancy construction plan and pay attention to the protection of water source forests in the Yellow River, Huai River, Yongding River and other water systems; the southern provinces must combine agricultural and sideline production to solve the problem of controlling fire sources and ensure the safety of forests; in some mountainous areas inhabited by ethnic minorities in the Southwest, we should strengthen ethnic unity work and organize ethnic minorities to carry out forest and mountain protection work. In all areas where serious pine caterpillar and bamboo locust disasters occur, we should not abandon the method of manual capture and beating, but in areas with suitable conditions, we should actively and gradually promote the advanced technology of drug and mechanical prevention and control.

    中央林业部召开全国护林工作座谈会
    中央人民政府林业部于八月二十七日至九月三日召开了全国护林工作座谈会。参加会议的有各省、市、自治区、重点林区专区、县、旗等单位代表共六十余人。林业部首席顾问苏联专家谢尔盖耶夫同志也出席会议，并详细介绍了苏联护林防火、防治病虫害的先进经验。
    会议总结了几年来的护林工作，认为在各级党委和人民政府的领导下，全国各地林区的护林防火、防治病虫害工作，取得了一定成绩，森林灾害的损失逐年下降。如一九五二年湖南省竹蝗为害竹林面积达十二万亩，今年已减少到五万多亩。目前护林工作存在的缺点，主要是在人口稀少、交通阻塞的大面积国有林区，还缺乏安全的有效防火措施，少数民族地区的天然林区和南方私有林区的护林工作也注意不够。因此，会议要求各地继续贯彻防胜于救的精神，广泛利用各种方式大力开展护林工作，使森林灾害的损失减至最低限度。会议根据各地区的工作条件和林区特点，明确了今后护林工作的中心任务：东北、内蒙古林区，除了继续贯彻各种有效的制度和加强航空巡护工作外，必须着重加强人口稀少、交通阻塞大面积国有林区保护工作，并逐步建立必要的永久性的安全措施；华北、西北和山东、河南等省应该配合国家全面水利建设计划，注意黄河、淮河、永定河等水系水源林的保护；南方各省必须结合农、副业生产解决控制火源，保障森林的安全，西南某些居住少数民族的山林地区，应该加强民族团结工作，组织少数民族开展护林护山工作。在所有发生严重松毛虫和竹蝗灾害的地区，目前仍不放弃人工捕打的方法，但在有条件的地区，应积极地逐步推广药械防治的先进技术。
