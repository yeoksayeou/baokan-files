    Cultivating Water Conservancy Construction Talent for the Motherland
  　Pan Di
    Mr. Yan Kai is one of the leading water conservancy experts in the country. In 1952, during the reorganization of departments and colleges in higher education institutions, he accepted the glorious task entrusted to him by the state to establish a water conservancy college. He served as the vice president of the East China Institute of Water Conservancy and, along with all the college cadres, meticulously and tirelessly planned the basic construction of the college. However, those who know him well are aware that before liberation, when he was teaching at various schools, he repeatedly declined to serve as the head of the water conservancy department. Today, he is dedicating his full energy to cultivating water conservancy construction talent for the motherland.
    Everyone knows that many great rivers flow across the land of our great motherland, and these rivers have a great impact on the production and life of our working people. However, during the period of reactionary rule, these rivers were not used to benefit the people. Major rivers such as the Yangtze, Yellow, and Huai rivers frequently flooded and caused disasters. The reactionary government was indifferent to this and did not try to prevent floods or carry out water conservancy projects. Therefore, at that time, water conservancy technical personnel had no opportunity to use their skills. Although Mr. Yan Kai had attainments in water conservancy academics and possessed this expertise, it could only be used as a means of survival at that time. He sadly told reporters that in the past he taught for many years, but he only trained more than a dozen students each year, and they still had nowhere to put their skills to use after graduation. At that time, he was determined to go to Ningxia to participate in the Yellow River water conservancy survey work, hoping to contribute to the water conservancy cause. However, after arriving in Ningxia, the reactionary government provided neither money nor people, and nothing could be accomplished. Even eating became a problem, and he had to return to school to teach. He said that what made him most sad was that China was not without, nor unable to cultivate water conservancy talent. However, in the past, when building seaports, the reactionary government insisted on relying on imperialism and had the Dutch Port Construction Company build them. When governing the Huangpu River, the chief engineers were always Dutch, Swiss, and British. When he went to the Kuomintang Junpu Bureau to borrow materials to study the future development of Huangpu River shipping, he was shocked to find that the basic data for our country's river management had all been taken away by imperialist engineers.
    After liberation, he saw that the People's Government attached importance to and encouraged scientific research workers, cared about water conservancy construction, and often humbly sought opinions from him and some of his friends who had water conservancy expertise. He also saw that some places quickly began water conservancy construction projects, and he was very moved. Thinking that his long-cherished wish to develop the motherland's water conservancy cause was now being realized under the encouragement of the state, and that his expertise now had a use, Mr. Yan Kai's heart was filled with a sense of happiness. Many facts made him sincerely believe that the Communist Party was the savior of the Chinese people, and that the People's Government was indeed the people's own government. He decided to contribute his technology and strength to the motherland. While actively teaching and cultivating talent, he also enthusiastically participated in practical work or maintained close contact with practical work. In 1950 and 1951, he went to Shandong and northern Jiangsu several times to participate in the survey and planning research work for governing the Yi and Shu rivers, as well as the survey work for the Huai River estuary. In 1950, he also participated in the construction of the Tanggu New Port. This year, the Yangtze River flood was very large, and he and the professors participated in flood control research work. Mr. Yan Kai is contributing his technology and ability to the socialist water conservancy construction cause of the motherland.
    Mr. Yan Kai attaches importance to learning from the advanced experience and theories of the Soviet Union and requires continuous improvement of his academic and professional level. In 1950, he began to teach himself Russian. Although he was very busy with teaching work every day, he still stipulated that 9:00 to 12:00 every night was his time for self-study of Russian. He persisted in this way for more than half a year. By 1951, he was able to read and translate some Soviet books. In the teaching reform, he actively united the professors of the whole college to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and improve teaching methods. He often personally took students to other places for internships and patiently answered students' difficult questions. Mr. Yan Kai's down-to-earth and responsible work style, his humble attitude in academic aspects, and his simple and approachable lifestyle have won the love of the teachers and students of the Water Conservancy College.
    Now, Mr. Yan Kai has been elected as a representative to the first Jiangsu Provincial People's Congress. When he received the reporter, he said uneasily: "I feel very honored, but even more ashamed, because I have done too little for the people." When we talked about the first seaport designed and built by the Chinese people themselves, the Tanggu New Port, in which he participated in the design, and when we mentioned the completion of the Yi and Shu River management projects in which he participated in the survey work, he always said modestly but excitedly: "Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, with the support of the people, there is nothing that cannot be done." At the same time, he talked about the state's encouragement and help for scientific research work, which really exceeded what he had hoped for in the past; the national water conservancy construction also exceeded the speed he had imagined. He said: "What has been done in the past few decades is not as much as what has been done in these few years after liberation. This year, 402 students graduated from the Water Conservancy College, which is much more than the total number of graduates from the water conservancy departments of various universities in the past ten years or so before liberation, but it is still not enough to meet the needs of water conservancy engineering departments all over the country." He said: The state is so urgently in need of construction talent and trusts him to lead the work of the Water Conservancy College in cultivating talent. If he cannot fulfill his responsibilities, he will be letting down the motherland and the people. He said: "In the future, I must often stay in touch with reality, care about national and provincial water conservancy construction, help construction departments solve some problems as much as possible, and also absorb the experience in construction in various places, enrich teaching materials, and cultivate outstanding water conservancy construction talent for the motherland."

    为祖国培养水利建设人材
  　潘荻
    严恺先生是全国有数的水利专家之一。一九五二年高等学校院系调整时，他接受了国家委托他创办水利学院的光荣任务，担任了华东水利学院副院长，和学院全体干部一道，兢兢业业、不辞劳苦地筹划着学院的基本建设事宜。但是，熟悉他的人都知道：解放前，当他在各校教书的时候，他是一再拒绝出任水利系主任的；而今天他却贡献了他的全副精力为祖国培养水利建设人材。
    谁都知道：在我们伟大祖国的土地上，奔流着许多巨大河流，这些河流对我国劳动人民的生产、生活有极大影响。但是，在反动统治时期，这些河流没有被利用来为人民谋福利，长江、黄河、淮河等大河流经常泛滥成灾。而反动政府对此无动于衷，不设法防汛和兴修水利，因此，那时，水利技术人材是学无所用的。严恺先生虽然对水利学术有造诣，有着这一门专长，而当时却只能当作求生工具。他伤心地告诉记者：过去教了多年书，但是每年不过培养十多个学生，毕业后仍然无处发挥作用。那时，他曾决心亲自到宁夏去参加黄河水利勘察工作，希望对水利事业有所贡献，可是，到了宁夏，反动政府既不给钱，又没有人，什么事也干不成，甚至连吃饭都成问题，他只得再回到学校教书。他说最使他伤心的是：我们中国不是没有，也不是不能培养水利人材，可是过去建筑海港，反动政府偏要投靠帝国主义，由荷兰筑港公司来建筑。治理黄浦江时，始终是由荷兰、瑞士、英国人担任总工程师，当他为了研究黄浦江航运发展前途，去向国民党浚浦局借材料时，不料我们国家治河的基本资料，竟都让帝国主义的工程师带走了。
    解放后他看到人民政府重视并鼓励科学研究工作者，关心水利建设，经常向他以及他的一些有水利专长的朋友虚心征询意见；又看到有些地方很快就开始了水利建设工程，他很受感动。想到自己多年来希望发展祖国水利事业的宿愿，现在正在国家的鼓励下实现着；自己的专长，现在有了用途。科学技术人员现在有了建设祖国的机会，严恺先生心里充满了幸福的感觉。许多事实使他真诚地相信共产党是中国人民的救星，人民政府的确是人民自己的政府，他决定为祖国贡献自己的技术和力量。他一面积极教学，培养人材，同时还热情地参加实际工作，或与实际工作取得密切联系。一九五○年和一九五一年，他几次到山东、苏北参加治理沂水、沭河的勘察和规划研究工作，以及淮河入海水道的勘察工作；一九五○年他还参加了塘沽新港的建港工作；今年长江洪水很大，他和教授一起参加防汛研究工作。严恺先生在为祖国社会主义水利建设事业贡献着自己的技术和能力。
    严恺先生重视学习苏联先进经验和理论，要求不断提高自己的学术和业务水平。一九五○年，他开始自学俄文，虽然每天教学工作很忙，但他仍然规定每晚九点到十二点钟为自学俄文时间，这样坚持了半年多，到一九五一年，他已能阅读并能翻译一些苏联书籍了。在教学改革中，他积极团结全院教授学习苏联先进经验，改进教学方法；他常亲自带学生到外地实习，并耐心为学生解答疑难问题。严恺先生踏实负责的工作作风，在学术方面的虚心态度，以及他朴素可亲的生活习惯，博得了水利学院师生们的爱戴。
    现在，严恺先生当选为江苏省第一届人民代表大会代表。当他接见记者时，他不安地说：“我感到很光荣，但是更惭愧，因为我为人民做的事太少了。”当我们谈到有他参加设计的中国人民自己建筑成功的第一个海港——塘沽新港时，当我们提起他参加过勘察工作的沂水、沭河的治理工程完工时，他总是谦逊却又兴奋地说：“在共产党和人民政府领导下，有人民群众支持，没有什么做不好的。”同时，他谈到国家对科学研究工作的鼓励和帮助，真是超过了他过去所希望的；全国水利建设也超过了他所想像的速度。他说：“过去几十年做的也没有解放后这几年做的多。今年水利学院毕业的学生有四百零二人，比解放前十几年来各大学水利系毕业生总人数还多得多，但是对全国各地水利工程部门的需要来说，却仍是不敷分配。”他说：国家如此迫切需要建设人材，又信任他，要他领导水利学院培养人材的工作，如果不能尽到自己的责任，将对不起祖国，对不起人民。他说：“今后我一定要经常与实际联系，关心全国、全省水利建设，尽可能帮助建设部门解决一些问题，同时也吸收各地建设中的经验，丰富教材，为祖国培养优秀的水利建设人材。”
