The history of seaports in old China is a history of oppression and enslavement. Since the Opium War and the opening of the five treaty ports, the construction, management, and utilization of our country's seaports have been completely controlled by imperialists, becoming bridgeheads for imperialist military and economic aggression.

After the birth of the People's Republic of China, a new history of Chinese seaports began. In these short five years, we have begun to realize the ideal of building seaports that the Chinese people have had for decades, completing projects that imperialist aggressors and reactionary governments could not complete. One of the great achievements of seaport construction projects in the past five years is the completion of the first phase of the Tanggu New Port project.

Tanggu New Port is located outside the mouth of the Hai River. It is the gateway to the capital, the outer port of Tianjin, and a hub for international trade and domestic North-South material exchange. Over the years, Tianjin has relied solely on a narrow and shallow Hai River to connect to the sea. Due to sediment accumulation at the river mouth, although dredging methods were used to maintain a channel, ships of more than 3,000 tons had to anchor outside Dagukou to load and unload cargo. This was not only time-consuming and costly for lighterage, but also made loading and unloading prone to accidents, and often stopped work due to wind and waves, delaying ship schedules. After the Japanese imperialists invaded our country, in order to plunder the rich mineral and agricultural products of North China, such as coal from Datong and Kailuan, salt from Changlu, iron from Longyan, and bauxite from Shanxi, they built Tanggu New Port on the mudflats north of the Hai River estuary. After two years of preparation and six years of construction, the plan was reduced more and more. By the time Japan was defeated and surrendered in 1945, only half of the final reduced plan had been completed. Although the Kuomintang bandits also advocated building a port, they actually not only did not carry out any construction, but also sold off equipment in the port on a large scale, and the channel became even more silted up. Not only could ships not enter the port, but even wooden boats and sampans could not dock. By the time of liberation in 1949, Tanggu New Port had become a ruin.

In August 1951, the State Council of the Central People's Government approved the decision to establish the Tanggu Port Construction Committee. The massive first-phase construction of Tanggu New Port began quickly. By October 17, 1952, the entire project was completed two and a half months ahead of schedule, taking one year and one and a half months. Excluding the three winter months when construction was impossible due to severe cold, it actually took only nine and a half months to complete a project that the enemy and puppets had dragged on for more than ten years, and what was completed was not a port planned by the enemy and puppets to berth 3,000- to 5,000-ton ships, but a port capable of berthing 10,000-ton giant ships.

It has been almost two years since the completion of Tanggu New Port, and the facts of the past two years have proven that Tanggu New Port is of great value to the development of our country's maritime transportation. The completion of Tanggu New Port has reversed the flow direction of some materials, reduced the cost of imported goods in North China, and also reduced the turnover costs of exported goods in North China, providing favorable conditions for the increasingly developed international trade and North-South maritime material exchange, and making the status of Tianjin Port increasingly higher. In the past, the materials exported from Tianjin Port generally accounted for less than 30 percent of the country's seaport exports, and the materials imported from Tianjin Port only accounted for 20 percent of our country's seaport imports. After the completion of Tanggu New Port, the status of Tianjin Port in our country's maritime transportation industry has been increasing, and the throughput has grown rapidly. In the first half of this year, the throughput of Tianjin Port increased by 53 percent compared with the same period last year.

The completion of Tanggu New Port has saved the state a huge amount of transshipment and lighterage fees. In the past, many goods transported from overseas were unloaded at other ports and then transported to Tianjin by train. Even the materials imported and exported through Tianjin Port could only be loaded and unloaded outside Dagukou and then lightered into the port. According to statistics in 1950, 70 percent of the throughput of Tianjin Port had to be lightered for loading and unloading. In 1951, the goods lightered for loading and unloading also accounted for 42 percent of the throughput. At that time, the lighterage and loading and unloading fees for one ton of goods from Tianjin to Dagukou were nearly 50,000 yuan. The increased freight cost for one lighterage, taking flour as an example, accounted for 83.2 percent of the maritime freight cost from Tianjin to Dalian. This huge cost has been completely saved after the completion of Tanggu New Port. The expense of ship demurrage fees has also been greatly reduced. According to statistics in the third quarter of 1952, ships staying outside Dagukou that could not load and unload due to wind and waves accounted for 12.4 percent of the ship's stay time in that quarter, extending the ship's berthing time in the port, and the state had to pay a ship demurrage fee. After the completion of Tanggu New Port, this situation began to change, and 10,000-ton ships entered with the tide, greatly shortening the berthing time of ships.

In the past two years, the appearance of Tanggu New Port has been constantly changing. The area of warehouses has doubled, the area of freight yards has increased by more than 40,000 square meters, and various mechanized equipment has been installed. The unloading of ships and loading of trains of large items have basically been mechanized. The management of Tanggu New Port has been continuously improved, and the employees have been continuously learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, greatly improving labor productivity.

Tanggu New Port is the first huge project for our people to build seaports. In the future, we will continue to build more and better ports to serve our country's socialist industrialization.

    塘沽新港对发展海运事业的作用
    全国人民代表大会代表 中央交通部筑港工程局副局长  谭真
    旧中国海港的历史是一部被压迫、被奴役的历史。从鸦片战争和五口通商以来，我国海港的修建、管理和运用，就完全操纵在帝国主义手中，成为帝国主义军事侵略和经济侵略的桥头堡。
    中华人民共和国诞生后，开始了中国海港的新历史。在这短短的五年中，我们开始实现了数十年来中国人民建设海港的理想，完成了一些帝国主义侵略者和反动政府所无法完成的工程。五年来，海港建设工程的巨大成就之一，就是塘沽新港第一期工程的完工。
    塘沽新港位于海河口外，它是首都的门户，天津市的外港，国际贸易和国内南北物资交流的吞吐口。历年来，天津市只靠一条狭浅的海河沟通大海。由于河口泥沙淤积，虽用挖泥方法维持一条航道，但三千吨以上的船只必须停泊在大沽口外装卸货物，不但驳运费时费钱，装卸工作容易发生事故，而且常因风浪停止工作，延误船期。日本帝国主义侵入我国后，为了掠夺我华北地区大同、开滦的煤、长芦的盐、龙烟的铁、山西的矾土等富饶的矿产和农产品，在海河口外北面泥滩上建设塘沽新港。筹备了两年，修建了六年，计划越修越少，到一九四五年日本战败投降时，只完成最后缩小计划的一半。国民党匪帮虽也鼓吹建港，实际上不但没有进行丝毫修建，反而大肆盗卖港内器材，航道反更淤浅，不但轮船不能入港，就连木船、舢板都不能靠岸。到一九四九年解放时，塘沽新港已成一片废墟。
    一九五一年八月，中央人民政府政务院通过了关于成立塘沽建港委员会的决定。巨大的塘沽新港第一期建设工程很快就开始了。到一九五二年十月十七日，全部工程提前两个半月完成。历时一年零半个月。除冬季三个月因严寒不能施工外，实际上仅用九个半月的时间，就完成了敌伪拖了十余年未能完成的工程，并且完成的不是敌伪计划停泊三、五千吨轮船的港口，而是能停靠万吨级巨轮的港口。
    塘沽新港建成至今已经快两年了，两年来的事实证明：塘沽新港对发展我国的海运事业，是有重大价值的。塘沽新港的建成，扭转了一部分物资的流转方向，降低了华北进口物资的成本，也减少了华北出口物资的周转费用，为日益发展的国际贸易和南北海上物资交流提供了有利条件，使天津港的地位日益提高，过去从天津港输出的物资，一般不到全国海港出口物资的百分之三十，从天津港进口的物资，也只占我国海港进口物资的百分之二十。塘沽新港建成后，天津港在我国海运事业中的地位日益提高，吞吐量迅速增长。今年上半年天津港的吞吐量就较去年同期提高了百分之五十三。
    塘沽新港的建成，给国家节省了巨额的转运费和驳运费。过去由外洋运来的货物，很多是卸在其他港口，然后用火车运到天津，即便经由天津港进出口的物资，也只能在大沽口外装卸，再经驳运入港。据一九五零年的统计，天津港有百分之七十的吞吐量，须经驳运才能装卸，一九五一年经驳运才装卸的货物也占吞吐量的百分之四十二，当时天津到大沽口一吨货的驳运费和装卸费近五万元，驳运一次所增加的运费，以面粉为例，就占天津去大连的海运运费的百分之八十三点二，这笔巨大的费用，在塘沽新港建成后，全部节省下来。船舶延期费的开支也大大节省，据一九五二年第三季度的统计，停留在大沽口外，因风浪不能装卸的船只；占该季船只停留时间的百分之十二点四，延长了船舶在港停泊时间，国家不得不开支一笔船舶延期费。塘沽新港建成后，这个情况开始转变了，万吨级轮船乘潮而入，大大缩短了船只停泊时间。
    两年来，塘沽新港的面貌在不断变化。仓库的面积增加了一倍，货场面积增加了四万多平方公尺，设置了各式各样机械化设备，大件物资的卸船、装车基本上都机械化了。塘沽新港的管理工作不断改善，员工们不断学习苏联的先进经验，大大提高了劳动生产率。
    塘沽新港是我国人民建设海港的第一个巨大工程，今后，我们还要继续建设更多更好的港口，为我国的社会主义国家工业化而服务。
