    A Man Full of Beautiful Ideals
  　Ao Xiaozong
    One morning in July, I met Mo Ri Ge Ce, a famous labor model in Inner Mongolia and a representative of the first People's Congress of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, at the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government Reception Building. He spoke to me very excitedly about his impressions of attending this conference. He said, "Comrade, look at me, this farmer, who was worn out from carrying loads for the landlords since I was a child. Needless to say, what rights could a person like me have in the past? I couldn't even touch the edge of rights. Things are different after liberation. I have gained rights, and I have also gained the benefits of rights. Today, I am also a people's representative. This is something I never dreamed of before. Isn't this honor brought to me by the Party leading the people to overthrow the reactionary regime! I feel that in the future, I must always think about everyone, do more things for everyone. This is my duty!" His frank and sincere words were very vivid and touching. Then he talked about the benefits of turning over to become masters of the land from the land reform to organizing and moving towards mutual aid and cooperation; from the past tragic experiences of the members to the happy life they are living today. In particular, he also kept in mind the kindness of the Soviet elder brother, and told me, "Our agricultural production cooperative has been renamed the 'Sino-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative'!" Then he told the following story.
    As early as March 1952, Mo Ri Ge Ce went to the Soviet Union to visit collective farms. When he was in the Soviet Union, a member named Xi Lian, due to the growth of the idea of getting rich individually, instigated other members within the cooperative, trying to win over a few members with low awareness to withdraw from the cooperative and work independently. Thus, by the time of the autumn harvest, the emotions of members Tong Bao, Xiao Chao Lu, and Qi Jin Bao fluctuated, and they were unwilling to pull carts and thresh grain, while member Fu Gui openly expressed his desire to withdraw from the cooperative and work independently. At that time, the situation had become so serious that this agricultural production cooperative, which had more than five years of mutual aid and cooperation foundation, was in danger of collapsing. Just at this critical moment, Mo Ri Ge Ce returned from the Soviet Union. He repeatedly promoted the benefits of Soviet farmers moving towards collectivization, using the actual examples he had seen with his own eyes in the Soviet Union, and relied on the Party and League members and activists within the cooperative to understand and grasp the real situation within the cooperative, breaking Xi Lian's instigation methods, reversing the ideological emotions of the members, and everyone united closely again to carry out production. Therefore, the cooperative achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest that year, yielding more than ten stones of grain per hectare on land that had previously only yielded four or five stones of grain. The fact of the superiority of Soviet collectivization and the joy of the bumper harvest increased the awareness of the members, and they all realized that only by following the path of Soviet collective farms can they live a better life. Soon, the members put forward a request, and with the approval of the higher authorities, the name of the cooperative was changed to Sino-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative.
    Now, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative led by Mo Ri Ge Ce has become an advanced form of agricultural production cooperative with collective land ownership. This spring, another twenty-four households of farmers voluntarily joined the cooperative, and they are all working hard to strive for a greater bumper harvest this year.
    After Mo Ri Ge Ce finished telling this story, he said: "The further consolidation and development of our cooperative is inseparable from the role of studying and promoting Soviet agricultural collectivization. Many members say: 'The Soviet elder brother is our example, their today is our tomorrow.' I believe that if we want to move towards the path of agricultural collectivization like the Soviet Union, we must resolutely implement the state's general task during the transition period."
    At the time of parting, Mo Ri Ge Ce told me a few of his plans for the future: they will work hard to build their hometown (Baiyinhua Gacha, Huerle Nutuk, Zalaite Banner) into a beautiful village: establish a collective livestock farm, plant trees and afforest, so that livestock are in groups and trees are all over the mountains, and strive to use tractors as soon as possible!
    "Comrade, I am a Communist Party member, but I still have many shortcomings. I always think that without the education and cultivation of the Party, and without the trust and help of the masses, a person can accomplish nothing," he said with a smile again. On the way back, I felt honored to have the opportunity to meet such a frank and humble, hardworking and beautifully idealistic people's representative.

    充满美丽理想的人
  　敖效宗
    七月的一个早晨，我在内蒙古自治区人民政府交际处大楼，会见了内蒙古著名劳动模范、内蒙古自治区第一届人民代表大会代表莫日格策。他十分兴奋地和我谈起了他出席这次大会的感想。他说：“同志，你瞧瞧我这个庄稼汉，从小给地主扛活累成了这个样子，还用说，过去我这样一个人能有什么权利？连个权利的边儿也沾不上的。解放后可不同啦，我得到了权利，也得到了权利的好处。今天又当了人民代表，真是从前作梦也没有想到的事。这光荣，还不是党领导人民群众推翻了反动政权给我带来的吗！我感到：今后更得处处为大家伙着想，多给大家伙办事，这是我应尽的义务啊！”他坦率而诚恳的几句话，说得非常逼真而动人。接着他从土地改革翻身分地谈到组织起来走向互助合作的好处；从社员们过去的悲惨经历谈到今天过的幸福光景。特别是，他还念念不忘苏联老大哥的恩情，并且告诉我说：“我们的农业生产合作社已经改名叫‘中苏友好农业生产合作社’啦！”随后他又讲述了这样一段故事。
    早在一九五二年三月间，莫日格策曾到苏联去参观集体农庄。当他在苏联参观期间，社员西连由于滋长了个人发财的打算，就在社内进行挑拨，想拉拢几个觉悟不高的社员一块退社单干。这样，到秋收时，社员佟宝、小超鲁、齐金宝等情绪波动，不愿拉地打场，而社员富贵更公开表示要退社单干。当时已经严重到这种局面：这个有五年多互助合作基础的农业生产合作社已有垮台的危险。正在这个紧急关头，莫日格策从苏联回来了。他拿在苏联亲眼看到的实际事例反复宣传苏联农民走向集体化的好处，并依靠社内党、团员和积极分子了解和掌握社内存在的真实情况，打破了西连的挑拨手段，扭转了社员的思想情绪，大家又紧密地团结起来进行生产。因此，这一年全社获得了空前的丰收，在一向只打四、五石粮的土地上，每垧地打了十石多粮。苏联集体化的优越性的事实，丰收的喜悦，使社员们的觉悟提高了，都认识到：只有走苏联集体农庄的道路，才能过更美好的光景。不久，社员们提出要求，经过上级批准改用了中苏友好农业生产合作社的名称。
    现在，莫日格策领导的中苏友好农业生产合作社已变成了土地集体所有的高级形式的农业生产合作社，今年春天又有二十四户农民自愿参加到社里来，他们都在努力争取今年更大的丰收。
    莫日格策谈完这段故事以后说：“我们社的进一步巩固和发展，是和学习宣传苏联农业集体化的作用分不开的。有许多社员都说：‘苏联老大哥是我们的榜样，他们的今天就是我们的明天。’我认为：我们要走向苏联那样农业集体化的道路，必须坚决贯彻国家在过渡时期的总任务。”
    临别的时候，莫日格策告诉我几句他对将来的打算：他们要努力把自己的家乡（扎赉特旗胡尔勒努图克白音花嘎查）建设成为一个美丽的村庄：成立集体畜牧场，植树造林，要使牲畜成群，满山遍地都是树木，还要争取早日使用拖拉机！
    “同志，我是一个共产党员，但是还有不少毛病。我总是这样想，若是没有党的教育和培养，没有群众的信任和帮助，一个人是什么也干不成的。”他又微笑地说。在归途上，我为自己能有机会会晤这样一位坦率而谦虚，肯干并有美丽理想的人民代表而感到荣幸。
