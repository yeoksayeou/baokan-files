Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 6th: The Press Office of the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic announced that the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic decided on September 3rd to implement a new and comprehensive price reduction for food, cigarettes and alcohol, daily consumer goods, as well as postage and telegram fees, starting from September 6th.

As a result of this price reduction, the purchasing power of the people of the German Democratic Republic will increase by approximately 600 million marks by the end of this year, and the purchasing power of the people will increase by 1.8 billion marks in 1955.

The rates of price reduction in food, cigarettes and alcohol are as follows: the price of various edible oils is reduced by 31% to 50%; flour and flour products by 21%; milk by 25%; egg powder by 34.5%; sugar food by 15% to 30%; beer by 10%; high-grade liquor by 17.5% to 30%; cigarettes by 20%.

The rates of price reduction in daily necessities are as follows: leather shoes by 30%; "Pylon" (Note: a kind of nylon-like synthetic fiber) fabrics by 24.8% to 25%; work clothes by 11%; sportswear by 12.5%; light bulbs by 25%; accordions by 10%; sports equipment by 18%; scented soap by 13%, etc.

This price reduction is the sixteenth in the five years since the founding of the German Democratic Republic. This price reduction proves the concrete effectiveness of the new policy and the continuous rise of economic construction. While West German workers, burdened by the heavy cost of rearmament, have to resort to strikes to defend their living standards, this step by the German Democratic Republic proves the superiority of its peaceful economy to the entire German people.

In the communiqué on the price reduction, the Council of Ministers also called on the people of the German Democratic Republic to strive with greater efforts to fulfill and over fulfill the production plan, and in particular to further improve the production of daily necessities in terms of improving quality and increasing variety.

    德意志民主共和国第十六次降低物价
    【新华社柏林六日电】德意志民主共和国总理新闻处公布：德意志民主共和国部长会议于九月三日决定自九月六日起实行食品、烟酒、日用消费品以及邮费和电报费等新的全面的降低物价。
    由于这次降低物价，到今年年底为止，德意志民主共和国人民的购买力将增加约六亿马克，一九五五年人民的购买力将增加十八亿马克。
    在食品及烟酒类中，降低物价的比率如下：各种食用油价格降低百分之三十一到五十；面粉及面制品百分之二十一；牛乳百分之二十五；鸡蛋粉百分之三十四点五；糖食品百分之十五到三十；啤酒百分之十；高级酒百分之十七点五到三十；纸烟百分之二十。
    在日用品方面的降低物价的比率如下：皮鞋百分之三十；“派龙”（注——一种类似尼龙的人造纤维）织物百分之二十四点八到二十五；工作服百分之十一；运动服百分之十二点五；电灯泡百分之二十五；手风琴百分之十；运动器具百分之十八；香肥皂百分之十三等。
    这次降低物价的是民主德国成立五年来的第十六次。这次降低物价证明了新方针的具体成效和经济建设的节节上升。正当因重整军备而负担惨重的西德工人不得不以罢工作为保卫他们生活水平的手段的时候，民主德国的这一步骤向全德国人民证明了它的和平经济的优越性。
    部长会议在降低物价的公报中，同时号召民主德国人民以更大努力为完成和超额完成生产计划而斗争，特别是在改善质量和增加品类上进一步提高日用品的生产。
