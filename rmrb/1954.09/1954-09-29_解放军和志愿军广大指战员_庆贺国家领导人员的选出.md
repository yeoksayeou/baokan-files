Xinhua News Agency, 28th: The broad commanders and fighters of the land, sea and air forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, on the 27th, all celebrated with the greatest enthusiasm the election of Mao Zedong, the most beloved leader of the Chinese people, as Chairman of the People's Republic of China, Zhu De as Vice Chairman, Liu Shaoqi as Chairman of the Standing Committee of the First National People's Congress, Zhou Enlai's appointment as Premier of the State Council, and the election and approval of other national leading workers. More than 1,000 radio stations and 100 wired broadcasting stations of the Central and Southern Military Region simultaneously listened to and rebroadcast the live broadcast of the election of national leading workers. The soldiers stationed on the Wanshan Islands ran around happily spreading the good news from this bay to that bay, and held celebrations with the local fishermen. After hearing the good news, the soldiers of a certain unit on Hainan Island danced in the coconut grove while singing songs such as "The East is Red" and "Ode to the Motherland".

When the units of the East China Military Region listened to the live broadcast of the election of national leading workers, applause and cheers resounded everywhere from the land to the islands and warships on the ocean. On a certain warship that Chairman Mao had visited, the sailors put on new uniforms, raised the flag with the most solemn ceremony, and moved the photo of Chairman Mao and the sailors and the portrait of Chairman Mao from the conference room to the deck. Everyone gathered around, singing and dancing. Sailor Zheng Meisheng said excitedly: "Chairman Mao wants us to love the islands and love the ocean. We must turn Chairman Mao's instructions into action, defend the territorial waters of our great motherland, and resolutely liberate the coastal islands and Taiwan occupied by the bandit Chiang!"

On the afternoon of the 27th, the pilots of the People's Air Force at a certain airport on the Zhejiang East Front, when flying back to the airport from the ocean, immediately braved the drizzle to listen to the live broadcast of the election of national leading workers at the airport with the commanders and ground crew. In the evening, the pilots took off again with joy, vigilantly guarding the sky over the coastal defense front. The soldiers at a radar station in a certain area on the front line closely monitored two Chiang bandit planes flying towards the near sea. After our air force repelled the Chiang bandit planes, the radar soldiers inquired about the good news of the election from friendly units, and everyone jumped up with excitement. In order to celebrate the election of Chairman Mao and the new national leading workers, they pledged to improve their vigilance, practice their skills, and cooperate with fraternal units to resolutely crack down on Chiang bandit planes.

On the afternoon of the 27th, thousands of soldiers stood in front of radios in various units listening to the good news. When the good news that the great leader Mao Zedong was elected as Chairman of the People's Republic of China and Zhu De was elected as Vice Chairman was announced, cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long, long live!" and applause resounded across the mountains and plains. The soldiers stationed on Mount Wusheng, more than 1,000 meters high, sang the song "The East is Red" loudly. The telephone switchboard operator conveyed the good news to the coastal defense troops by telephone. On that day, gongs and drums were heard all over the Korean front, and songs such as "Ode to the Motherland" and "Ode to Chairman Mao" were sung everywhere.

On the evening of the 27th, many units of the Volunteer Army held celebrations. The soldiers of a certain unit on Mount Wusheng surrounded the portraits of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Zhu with red ribbons, taking turns carrying them, singing and dancing. A certain tank unit published an extra edition of the blackboard newspaper overnight, writing the news of Chairman Mao's election in large characters.

They said: Chairman Mao, you are our hope for victory and the guarantee of happiness. We must follow your instructions, be honest, diligent, mutually encouraging and helpful, guard against any exaggeration and pride, guard the position more vigilantly, and fight to the end to defend the socialist construction of the motherland and strive for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue!
