    Moonlit Night on the Wuhan Levee
    Collective writing by Xinhua News Agency reporters

    On the Mid-Autumn Festival night, the Yangtze River was a captivating picture. The bright moon illuminated the rolling river into a sheet of silver. On the endless levees on both sides of the Yangtze River, the neatly arranged electric lights shone like twinkling stars. Just after six o'clock, melodious songs echoed from all the loudspeakers on the Yellow Crane Tower. People gazing at the Mid-Autumn night scene of the three towns of Wuhan from the Yellow Crane Tower proudly spoke of the surging river water conquered by labor. The heroic city of Wuhan, still standing firm before the flood, celebrated the Mid-Autumn Festival in joy. That night, due to the autumn wind that picked up in the evening, the Flood Control Headquarters issued a warning order, and the levee became a place of both celebration and vigilance. On the levee about 100 meters from Pinghu Gate, more than a hundred members of a rescue team composed of handicraft workers and a service team composed of street residents began their celebration at seven o'clock. The gas lamps hanging from the trees illuminated their joyful smiling faces. An ordinary neighborhood woman, Ye Qiu'e, stood up from the crowd and said, "I couldn't sing originally, but I'm so happy tonight, let me sing one!" With that, she sang "Women's Representative." At nine o'clock, more than ten teachers and students from the Wuchang Kindergarten Normal School rushed to the levee with props, having come after finishing a performance elsewhere. They performed a puppet show about flood control. In a courtyard opposite the Hanyangmen Wharf, the celebration of the soldiers and farmers participating in flood control was also very lively. The venue displayed letters of appreciation from people from all walks of life received by the soldiers during the Mid-Autumn Festival. On a stage built by the soldiers themselves, soldiers and farmers sang songs, clapper talks, and comedic dialogues. At the Wuhan Customs, one could see that the Yangtze River's water level was now at 28.45 meters—1.28 meters lower than the highest water level this year. This made people realize it was a victory, although hard work was still needed to finally defeat the flood. Celebrations were taking place in various forms in different places. In the open-air square in front of the kindergarten of the Zhongnan State-Owned Commercial System near the levee, there were performances of rich and colorful literary and artistic programs; some representatives of the慰问团 (comfort groups) enjoyed the magnificent view of the soon-to-be-completed iron bridge spanning the Han River together with the flood control army. At the joint celebration of the seventh group of the third sub-group of the flood control 慰问团 and the fifth section of the third flood control headquarters, after the representatives of the 慰问团 performed the program "Good News of Merit Arrives Home," the construction workers and public security soldiers of the second rescue team performed their own creation—"Ramming." This was the most popular of all the performances. Its exceptionally realistic depiction of ramming constantly drew unanimous cheers from the audience. When the performers sang the battle song "Defeat the Flood" while ramming the embankment, the celebrants couldn't help but sing along, forming an exciting climax of joy.

    The moonlight quietly shone on the majestic levees of the Danshuichi area. This was where a breach occurred in 1931, and the levee was guarded with particular care. But just inside the levee, dense crowds erupted in bursts of joyous sound. This was the team that had won the flood control battle and the representatives who came to express their appreciation, celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival together with the farmers in the suburbs. A celebration大会 (general meeting) of one thousand several hundred people began. Danshuichi is northeast of Hankou, and the river levee from here turns westward into Zhanggong Levee. Right near this place, Lin Jianmin, a resident representative of the 慰问团, met her daughter, Lu Mengning, on Zhanggong Levee. Mother and daughter watched the慰问团's performance program together in the moonlight. Lu Mengning had not been with her mother for more than a month, and at this moment, she felt more deeply that the flood control battle was protecting her mother.

    When the farmers of Guangchi Township under the Danshuichi levee were celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival, the elderly couldn't help but recall the painful scenes of twenty-three years ago. In 1931, long before the Mid-Autumn Festival, the flood broke through the levee from Fengjiadun in Danshuichi, and Chen Jinshan's mother, a porter, was drowned at that time; Huang Shiting only managed to salvage a tattered mosquito net from his home. But today, they still live in the old place of Fengjiadun in Danshuichi, and both the Chen Jinshan and Huang Shiting families celebrated a Mid-Autumn Festival without being flooded. Huang Shiting's daughter brought Huang Shiting wine and mooncakes. According to the custom of Hubei, they ate tangyuan in the morning, drank wine at noon, and ate mooncakes in the evening, the whole family enjoying a happy and reunited life.

    The mechanical drainage station on Zhanggong Levee near Jin'yintan looked even more beautiful in the moonlight. The pumping machines, with a total of nearly ten thousand horsepower, were still making a roaring noise, and the accumulated water sprayed from the pipes merged with the flood outside the levee, stirring up snow-white waves. More than 100 million cubic meters of accumulated water had already been drained outside the levee. Drainage workers from Beijing, Zhengzhou, and more than 50 factories in Wuhan, and representatives of the second Wuhan Flood Control慰问团 held a celebration in the open-air club next to the levee, enjoying the bright moon together. Drainage worker Wu Niu'nai's whole family was flooded in the great flood of 1931. He was only fourteen years old at the time, and followed his family to wander outside, begging along the streets by playing the "sanbanggu" (three-clapper drum). Today, he excitedly performed the "sanbanggu" at the celebration, and even composed new lyrics to express his inner joy. Drainage worker Liu Jinkui from the Guanting Reservoir won the title of first-class hero in the flood control effort. On this Mid-Autumn Festival day, he received three letters of appreciation from residents of Wuhan. He sat in his shed, eating pears and mooncakes sent by the慰问团 while writing replies.

    On Zhanggong Levee, which meanders to the western suburbs of Hankou, tens of thousands of flood control troops were also immersed in joy. Gushushu Town, where the headquarters of the first section of Zhanggong Levee was located, had built a celebration venue that could accommodate three to four thousand people. After the evening banquet, the People's Liberation Army troops guarding the levee, construction workers, and twelve rescue teams from suburban farmers, lined up in neat ranks and flocked to the celebration venue one after another. Just at this moment, a level four or five gale suddenly rose on Zhanggong Levee, and the various rescue teams mostly stopped their celebrations due to receiving emergency orders. The reporter interviewed the seventh workers' team, which accepted the task of preparing for rescue. They rushed back to their station from the venue and immediately held a combat mobilization meeting. Everyone expressed their determination to celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival with practical actions. Patrol team members patrolled carefully in twos and threes, carrying horse lamps. The spots of moving lights adorned the quiet levees protecting the three towns. Late at night, the cars of the leading comrades of the Flood Control Headquarters were still speeding on the levee.

    武汉堤上的月夜
    新华社记者集体采写
    中秋之夜，长江上是一幅迷人的图画。明月把滚滚的江水照耀成一片银色。在长江两岸一望无尽的长堤上，排列得十分整齐的电灯，好像明星在闪烁。时针刚过六点，黄鹤楼上所有的扩音器响起了悠扬的歌声。人们在黄鹤楼上眺望武汉三镇中秋的夜色，就自豪地谈论着被劳动所征服了的汹涌的江水。仍然屹立在洪水前的英雄的武汉市，市民们在欢乐中过着中秋节。这夜，由于傍晚刮起了秋风，防汛总指挥部下了警戒命令，堤上就一面联欢一面警戒。在距平湖门一百公尺左右的堤上，一百多个由手工业工人组成的抢险队和街道居民组成的服务队队员们七点钟开始联欢，树上吊着的汽灯照亮了人们欢乐的笑脸，一位普通的街坊妇女叶秋娥从人群中站起来了，她说：“我本来不会唱，但今晚我太高兴了，就唱一个吧！”说罢，她唱起了“妇女代表”。九点钟时，武昌幼儿师范学校的十多个师生们扛着道具赶到堤上，她们是在别的地方演完了以后赶来的。她们表演了有关防汛内容的布袋木偶戏。在汉阳门码头对面的一个院落里，参加防汛的部队战士和农民的联欢也十分热烈。会场上公布着战士们在中秋节收到的各界人民的慰问信。在战士们自己搭起的舞台上，战士和农民演唱了歌曲、快板、对口说等节目。在武汉关，人们可以看出此时的长江水位是二八点四五公尺——比今年最高水位已经降落一点二八公尺了。它使人们意识到这是一个胜利，虽然要最后战胜洪水还需进行艰苦的工作。联欢活动以各种各样的形式在不同的场所进行着。在江堤近旁的中南国营商业系统幼儿园门前的露天广场上，有丰富多采的文艺节目的表演；有的慰问团的代表和防汛大军一起，共赏了横跨汉水的即将建成的铁桥的壮丽图景。在防汛慰问团第三分团第七小组和第三防汛指挥部第五工段共同举行的联欢会上，当慰问的代表表演了“立功喜报到了家”的节目后，抢险二分队的建筑工人和公安战士们就演出了他们自己的创作——“打夯”。这是这里所有演出的节目中最受欢迎的一个。它以异常逼真的打夯形象不断地获得全场一致的喝彩。当表演者演到打夯堤工齐唱“战胜洪水”的战歌的时候，联欢的人们都情不自禁的唱起来，形成了激动人心的欢乐的高潮。
    月光静静地照着丹水池一带雄伟的堤防。这是一九三一年曾经溃口的地方，堤上被防守得特别严密。但在紧靠堤的内边，密集的人群时而响起欢乐之声。这是防汛胜利了的队伍和前来慰问的代表们，和郊区的农民们在共度中秋节。一千几百人的联欢大会开始了。丹水池在汉口的东北，沿江堤由此折而向西为张公堤。就在此处附近，慰问团的居民代表林剑民在张公堤上会见了她的女儿卢孟凝。她们母女两人在月光下同看慰问演出的戏目。卢孟凝已经一个多月不和她的妈妈在一起了，这时她才更深刻地感到防汛战斗是在保卫着自己的妈妈。
    丹水池堤下广池乡农民在欢度中秋的时候，年老的人不禁回想起二十三年前的惨痛情景。一九三一年，还在中秋节以前许久许久，洪水正是从丹水池冯家墩这里破堤而入，搬运工人陈金山的母亲便是那时被水淹死的；黄世庭仅从家里抢出了一顶破蚊帐。而今天，他们还是住在丹水池冯家墩这个老地方，陈金山和黄世庭两家都欢度了没有受水淹的中秋节。黄世庭的女儿给黄世庭送来了酒和月饼，他们按照湖北民间的习惯，早上吃了汤元，中午喝了酒，晚上还吃了月饼，一家老小过着幸福团圆的生活。
    金银滩附近张公堤上的机器排水站，在月光下显得更加美丽。近万匹马力的抽水机仍在发出轰隆的巨响，管道里喷出的积水和堤外的洪水相汇合，激起雪白的浪花。一亿多立方公尺的积水已经排到堤外了。来自北京、郑州等地以及武汉市五十多个工厂的排水工人，和武汉市第二届防汛慰问团的代表在堤旁的露天俱乐部里举行联欢，共赏明月。排水工人吴牛乃，一九三一年大水灾时全家被淹，那时他才十四岁，随着家人出外流浪，靠打“三棒鼓”沿街行乞，今天，他激动地在联欢会上表演了
  “三棒鼓”，自己并编了新的鼓词，表达内心的欢乐。来自官厅水库的排水工人刘金魁，在防汛中获得了一等功臣的称号，中秋节的这一天，他收到了三封武汉市居民的慰问信。他坐在自己的工棚里，一边吃着慰问团送来的梨子、月饼，一边写着回信。
    蜿蜒到汉口西郊的张公堤上，一万几千名防汛大军同样沉浸在欢乐中。张公堤第一工段指挥部所在地姑嫂树镇，修了一个可容三、四千人的联欢会场。晚宴之后，守堤的解放军部队、建筑工人、郊区农民十二支抢险大队，排着整齐的队伍，陆续向联欢会场拥来。恰恰在这时，张公堤上忽然起了四、五级的大风，各个抢险大队由于接到了紧急命令，多停止了联欢活动。记者访问了接受准备抢险任务的第七工人大队，他们由会场赶回驻地，立即召开了战斗动员大会，大家表示以实际行动庆贺中秋节。巡堤队员三三两两提着马灯在仔细巡逻，点点流动的灯火点缀着保卫三镇的安静的堤防。深夜，防汛指挥部领导同志们的巡堤的汽车，还在堤上驰骋着。
