City Residents' Experiences
    ——A Record of Wulaocun Residents in Nanjing Discussing the Draft Constitution
    Yu Ming, Xi Ping
    One hot afternoon in August, the Wulaocun Residents' Committee of Nanjing, a national model hygiene village, held a discussion meeting on the draft constitution in a newly built kindergarten. In addition to some residents of Wulaocun, several workers, young people, and government employees who had lived in Nanjing for a long time also participated in this discussion. These urban working people had different experiences in life and different understandings of the draft constitution.
    The discussion first focused on the preamble and general principles.
      The People Are Now Masters of Their Own Affairs
    An old lady, Chen Guifu, started the discussion. She said that before liberation, her son was doing underground revolutionary work at night, and sometimes he didn't come back for two or three nights. Kuomintang secret agents were always wandering around her door. Once, her son saw that she was scared and said to her, "Mom, don't be afraid. I'm doing this work for the people. It doesn't matter if I sacrifice myself, because millions of people will live a good life." One day, her son went out to a meeting and didn't come back until midnight. She was so anxious that she cried. A comrade who lived in her house and worked with her son in the underground comforted her and said, "Auntie, don't be sad. If he sacrifices himself, just treat me as your son!" Now when I think about it, these things seem like they happened yesterday." She said, "The draft constitution says that it is necessary to safeguard the achievements of the people's revolution, and I fully support it."
    Ge Chunjiang, a water worker from Nanjing, Shan Changsheng, a post office worker from Pukou, and resident Shu Shiqing, who attended the meeting, talked about the state led by the working class caring for the working people and the people being masters of their own affairs when they discussed Articles 1 and 2 of the draft constitution. Ge Chunjiang said:
  "Since liberation, I have deeply felt the people's government's concern for the working people. Many working people in Nanjing used to have no tap water to drink, but after liberation, they all have tap water. The people's government installed a tap water station for the residents of Wulaocun, which is a good example." Shan Changsheng said: "I am a porter at the Nanjing Post Office. I am already sixty years old this year. In the past, I was always oppressed by others, but now our status is completely different. Now we can talk directly to the bureau chief and section chief about our opinions, and we can usually study work with them; some workers even go to the mayor's office to participate in symposiums! Before liberation, where would a bureau chief or section chief be willing to talk to us?" Resident Shu Shiqing used the three elections he participated in before and after liberation to illustrate that the people are truly masters of their own affairs today. He said that the first time he saw an election in the old society was to elect a puppet fang chief (higher than bao chief). The day before the election, the police of the Kuomintang reactionary government came to inform him and asked his father to elect a man named Wang Fang, and told him the person's name was on which line of the ballot. The day after the election, the police also came to check and asked his father if he had elected the person they designated. The second time was to elect a puppet senator. Before the election, someone informed them who to elect. He said, "When voting, the police stood at the door. From the moment we entered the door, someone followed us. Next to the ballot box, there were also police with guns monitoring the voting." He said, "The votes were cast, but these people did not represent the will of our people." He said, "Later, many puppet national representatives came from all over the country. How these people were produced can be imagined from the above facts." Then he talked about the situation after liberation: "After liberation, elections of representatives are subject to repeated discussions by the people, and outstanding people are selected. Last year, I participated in the nationwide general election. The candidates for representatives were nominated by everyone, and the democratic parties, people's organizations, and resident representatives jointly discussed and put forward their own opinions after careful discussions at large and small meetings. Even if you disagree with the proposed candidates, you can still vote according to your own opinions when voting. The people elected in this way are the real people's representatives. I myself was honorably elected as a people's representative. At the district people's congress meeting, the district head also reported the government's work to the representatives and asked us to put forward our opinions. This shows that Article 2 of the draft constitution has been implemented, and our people are truly masters of their own affairs."
      "Could the Old Society Be Like This?"
    Residents Huang Guilan, Guo Xiuying, and Huang Wenqing, combined with their own lives, talked about the development of the state-owned economy, the glory of labor, and the spirit of state organ personnel serving the people as stipulated in the draft constitution. Huang Guilan, a small vegetable vendor, thought of the pain she suffered before liberation when she talked about the development of the state-owned economy. She cried as she spoke. She said, "Before liberation, I had little capital, so I went to sell vegetables before dawn, but at that time prices were soaring. When I finished selling the vegetables in the evening, the money I got could not buy as many vegetables as before." "At that time, the officials of the Kuomintang reactionary government were corrupt and colluded with unscrupulous merchants to speculate. Sometimes we wanted to buy some rice to eat. We clearly saw that the rice in the Kexiang Rice Store was piled up like a high mountain, but the boss said there was no rice. They hoarded grain, and the lives of us poor people were at their mercy." She said, "After liberation, with state-owned stores and cooperatives leading the market, the size and price were fair and reasonable when buying cloth and grain. We vegetable sellers all go to the cooperative for wholesale purchases, and we can earn a certain amount of money every day. It has been raining heavily for the past two months, and the water is so high, but the price of rice has not risen at all, because the grain is purchased and sold by the state, and unscrupulous merchants cannot speculate." She said, "The draft constitution stipulates that the state-owned economy should be developed. I truly support it from the bottom of my heart, and our lives will be more secure in the future." Guo Xiuying said: "The draft constitution stipulates that labor is a glorious thing. It is not easy to win this point! This is really in the hearts of us working people." She also said: "I saw that the draft constitution does not have any provisions on the liberation of Taiwan. The liberation of Taiwan is the will of the people of the whole country and the task of the people of the whole country. It should be stipulated in it."
    Resident Huang Wenqing excitedly talked about the spirit of state organ personnel closely contacting the masses and serving the people after liberation. He said: District Head Wang Bingkai of our district has always been kind, amiable, and conscientious to us. He asks for our opinions on matters related to our place. Once, a staff member's attitude towards the masses was not good enough. After he heard about it, he immediately educated the staff member. Although the mayor and deputy mayor of Nanjing are very busy, they sometimes come here to ask us about our lives. A comrade from the Supervision Committee of the Provincial People's Government looks at the opinion box here every day when he goes to and from work. He said: Take police officer Comrade Li as an example: He is in our village all day long, helping us with various tasks, and we treat him like a member of our family. When he walks on the street at night, he helps to collect the clothes that the residents have not taken back; last winter, when he saw that resident Chen Futing was not wearing a cotton coat, he took off his own undershirt and gave it to Chen Futing to wear. Huang Wenqing said, "Before liberation, we saw the police like little ghosts seeing Yama. Where can it be compared to today?" Huang Wenqing continued: In this flood control work, we deeply felt that the organ staff are loyal to the people's democratic system. The leaders of our people's government are leading the flood control work at the front line of flood control; after several days of heavy rain, our village was flooded, and the district head, the director, and the police officer went to our homes in the rain to check the houses. Thinking back to the year of the flood in 1931, the Kuomintang reactionary government asked us for a lot of money, but they did not care about us who were hit by the flood at all. The draft constitution says that state organ staff should be loyal to the people's democratic system and strive to serve the people. We feel that if this is stipulated, state organ staff will better serve the people in the future. Huang Wenqing finally said: Chapter 4 of the draft constitution has provisions on the national flag, national emblem, and capital, but there are no provisions on the national anthem; in addition, the draft constitution does not stipulate our country's national borders. I think the national anthem can encourage the people to love the motherland, and the provisions on national borders can prevent aggression. These two points should be stipulated.
    After the first part of the discussion was over, everyone took a short break and then discussed the "Basic Rights and Obligations of Citizens".
    True Freedom and Democracy
    Resident Shan Aizhen first expressed her opinion on the provision that all citizens are equal before the law. Shan Aizhen said: "I remember one year when we lived in Changfu Street, a battalion commander of the Kuomintang reactionary army lived nearby. He always showed off his power to the residents. One night, his family lost something, and he falsely accused my mother of stealing it. The next day, my mother was arrested. My father was not convinced and sold a carriage to file a lawsuit, but the law at that time protected the bureaucrats. The officer hired a lawyer, and we could not argue with him. The lawsuit was still unresolved after a year. Shan Aizhen said: The laws of the reactionaries protected those bureaucrats, and we ordinary people could not get protection. But after liberation, the situation was very different. The government does everything fairly, and the people can report state organ staff who violate the law.
    Young people Zhu Chengxue and Mao Zheng'e used the oppression suffered by young students before liberation to illustrate the preciousness of the provision in the draft constitution that citizens have freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association, procession, and demonstration. Zhu Chengxue said: Before liberation, the students of Nanjing, like the people of the whole country, had no freedom. Reactionary organizations tightly surrounded young students. At that time, as long as you said a word asking for patriotism and freedom, you would be persecuted by secret agents. As for the freedom of assembly and association, that was even more
  Empty words. For example, the candidates for the student union of the puppet Central University were all designated by the Kuomintang reactionary party's training office. Later, due to the development of the national people's democratic movement, the students elected themselves. However, when the secret agents failed in the election, they would beat progressive students, and the school's training office would disband the student union. As for the students' inter-school organization - the student union, it could only take the form of secret activities, and there was no freedom at all. Talking about the freedom of assembly and demonstration, Zhu Chengxue said that in 1947, when students held a parade for the "anti-hunger, anti-civil war, anti-persecution" movement, the secret agents used water dragons, whips, and wooden sticks to beat unarmed students at the Zhujiang Road intersection, injuring more than 30 students on the spot and arresting 14 people. He said that this is how the freedom of speech, assembly, association, and demonstration was devastated before liberation. Zhu Chengxue said: After liberation, not only do we have our own newspapers and periodicals, but also newspapers and periodicals specially for young people, such as "China Youth Daily" and "China Youth". In addition to class meetings, grade meetings, and student unions, there are also many scientific and artistic societies in schools. During festivals, young students can carry out various activities. This free and democratic life is not easy to come by! Mao Zheng'e continued: Now, when we recall the Kuomintang reactionaries' persecution of young people, many young people who have not yet reached adulthood think that this is incomprehensible, but this is indeed what their older brothers and sisters have experienced. Now, the young people living in the new China are so happy. The schools established by the state for them are increasing year by year, and young people can receive communist education and various knowledge education. People who are 18 years old participate in election activities, and outstanding young people are also elected as representatives of the people's congress. Now the draft constitution stipulates that the state will guarantee these rights and freedoms for us, and will also care about our physical and intellectual development, and we will live a happier life in the future.
    Finally, everyone also discussed the draft constitution's provisions that the state should gradually expand health facilities, gradually expand various schools and other cultural and educational institutions, and so on. Chen Fengyun said: The state is so concerned about our working people that I would like to propose a supplementary opinion to the draft constitution. I think that after Article 96, which stipulates that the state protects children and mothers, another sentence should be added: "And give special care to mothers with many children." Because mothers with many children have more difficulties than ordinary people and need more care from the state.
    In the discussion meeting, everyone expressed their willingness to work hard to realize a socialist society.

    城市居民的体会
    ——记南京市五老村居民讨论宪法草案
    于明　习平
    八月里一个炎热的下午，全国甲等卫生模范村——南京市五老村居民委员会召开的宪法草案讨论会，在一座新盖起来的幼儿园里举行。参加这一讨论会的，除了五老村部分居民外，还有久住南京市的工人、青年和机关工作者数人。这些城市劳动人民，生活里有过种种不同的遭遇，对宪法草案也有种种不同的体会。
    讨论会首先讨论了序言和总纲部分。
      人民当家作主了
    一个老太太陈桂馥开头发言。她说，解放前，她的儿子晚上做地下革命工作，有时候两三夜都不回来。国民党特务老是在她的家门口转来转去。有次，她的儿子看到她害怕了，就对她说：“妈，你不要怕，我做这工作是为了人民的，我一个人牺牲了不要紧，可是千千万万的人民就会过好日子了。”有一天，她的儿子出去开会，半夜里还没有回来，她急得哭了，住在她家和她儿子一起做地下工作的同志就安慰她说：“伯母，你不要难过，假如他牺牲了，你就把我当作你的儿子吧！”我现在想想，这些事情就像是在昨天发生的一样。”她说：“宪法草案里说要保卫人民革命的成果，我是十分拥护的。”
    参加会议的南京市自来水工人葛春江、浦口邮局工人单长胜和居民束世清，谈到宪法草案第一条、第二条时，谈起了工人阶级领导的国家对劳动人民的关怀和人民当家作主的情况。葛春江说：
  “解放以后，我深深体会到人民政府对劳动人民的关心，南京市许多劳动人民过去没有自来水吃，在解放后都用上自来水了。人民政府为五老村居民安装了自来水站，就是一个好例子。”单长胜说：“我在南京邮局做搬运工作，今年已经是六十岁的人了，过去总是受别人的压迫，可是现在我们的地位完全不同了，现在我们有意见可和局长、处长直接谈话，平时可和他们一起研究工作；有的工人还到市长那里参加座谈会哩！解放前，一个局长、处长那里还愿意和我们谈话？”居民束世清拿他在解放前和解放后参加的三次选举，说明了今天人民是真正当家作主了。他说，他在旧社会里，第一次看到选举，是选伪坊长（比保长大）。选举的头一天，国民党反动政府的警察就来通知了，要他父亲选一个叫做王方的人，并告诉了那个人的名字是在选票第几行上。选过的第二天，警察还来检查，问他父亲是不是选了他所指定的人。第二次是选伪参议员，也是在选举之前就有人通知他们选什么人了，他说：“在选举时，门口站了警察，从我们一进门起，就有人跟着我们走，在票箱的旁边，还有带着枪的警察在监视投票。”他说：“票是投了，可是这些人那里是代表我们人民意志的呢？”他说：“后来，从全国各地来了许多伪国大代表。这些人是怎样产生的，从上面事实，就可想而知了。”接着他谈到了解放后的情况：“解放后，选举什么代表都是要经过人民再三讨论，从优秀人物中挑选。去年全国普选，我也参加了选举，代表候选人是经过大家提名，各民主党派、人民团体、居民代表等共同商量出来的，又经过人民开大会、小会，仔细讨论，提出了自己的意见。就是自己不同意所提出的候选人，在投票的时候，还是可以按照自己的意见来选举。这样选出来的人，才是真正的人民代表。我自己也光荣地当选为人民代表。这次开区人民代表大会会议，区长还向代表们报告政府工作，要我们提意见。这说明了宪法草案的第二条已经实行了，我们人民真正当家作主了。”
      “旧社会那能这样？”
    居民黄桂兰、郭秀英、黄文卿结合自己的生活，谈起了宪法草案中所规定的发展国营经济、劳动光荣的事情，和国家机关人员为人民服务的精神。黄桂兰是一个卖菜的小商贩，谈到发展国营经济，她就联想到解放前所受的痛苦。她谈得哭起来了。她说：“解放前自己本钱小，早晨天不亮就去贩菜，可是那时物价飞涨，等到天黑时把菜卖完，得到的钱，就买不到原来那么多菜了。”“那时国民党反动政府的官吏贪污腐化，和奸商联合起来投机倒把。我们有时想买点米吃吃，明明看到科巷米店里的米堆得高山一样，可是老板却说没有米了，他们囤积了粮食，我们穷人的生活就得由他们摆布。”她说：“解放以后有了国营商店和合作社领导市场，买布买粮时，尺寸和价钱都公平合理。我们卖菜的都到合作社批购，每天都能赚到一定的钱。近两月来连续下大雨，水这么大，可是米价一点也没有涨，就是因为粮食由国家统购统销了，奸商不能投机了。”她说：“宪法草案规定要发展国营经济，我真是从心里拥护，以后我们的生活就更有保障了。”郭秀英说：“宪法草案中规定劳动是光荣的事情，争得这一点，也真是不容易啊！这真是对我们劳动人民的心。”她又说：“我看到宪法草案里没有关于解放台湾的规定，解放台湾是全国人民的意志，也是全国人民的任务，应该把它规定进去才好。”
    居民黄文卿激动地谈起了解放后国家机关人员，密切联系群众，为人民服务的精神。他说：我们区里的王炳凯区长从来对我们就是亲切、和蔼、办事认真，有关我们这个地方的事，他都要征求我们的意见。有一次，一个工作人员对待群众的态度不够好，他听到后，立刻教育了那个工作人员。南京市的市长、副市长虽然工作很忙，有时也跑到这里来向我们问长问短。省人民政府监察委员会的一个同志，每天上班下班，都要看看我们这里意见箱里有没有意见。他说：就拿公安员李同志来说吧：他一天到晚在我们村里，帮助我们作各种工作，和我们处的像是一家人。他晚上走到街上看到居民没有收回去的衣服，就帮助收起来；去年冬天，他看到居民陈福庭没有穿上棉衣，就把自己靠身的卫生衣脱下来给陈福庭穿。黄文卿说：“解放前我们见了警察就像小鬼见了阎王一样，那里能和今天比呢？”黄文卿接着说：在这次防汛工作中，我们更深深体会到机关工作人员是效忠人民民主制度的。我们人民政府的首长，都在防汛前线领导防汛工作；连下了几天大雨以后，我们村子里有了水，区长、所长、公安员都冒雨到我们各家察看房屋。想起一九三一年发大水的那一年，国民党反动政府向我们要了很多钱，可是对我们遭水灾，却是一点也不管。宪法草案中说，国家机关工作人员要效忠人民民主制度，努力为人民服务，我们觉得这样规定，以后国家机关工作人员就会更好的为人民办事了。黄文卿最后说：宪法草案的第四章里，有关于国旗、国徽、首都的规定，可是没有国歌的规定；另外宪法草案里也没有规定我国的国界。我觉得国歌可以鼓舞人民热爱祖国，有了国界的规定可以防止侵略，这两点应该规定进去。
    第一部分讨论完后，休息片刻，大家接着又讨论了“公民的基本权利和义务”。
    真正的自由和民主
    居民单爱珍首先对公民在法律上一律平等的规定发表意见。单爱珍说：“记得有一年我们住在常府街，附近住的是一个国民党反动军队的营长，他平常对居民总是耀武扬威。有一天夜里，他家丢了东西，就诬称是我母亲偷的，第二天我母亲就被逮捕了。我父亲不服气，卖了一副马车去打官司，但是，那时的法律是维护官僚的，那个军官请了一个律师来，我们说不过他，这个官司打了一年还是没有结果。单爱珍说：反动派的法律，就是保护那些官僚的，我们普通人是得不到保护的。但是在解放以后情况就大大不同了，政府做什么事都是公正的，国家机关工作人员犯了法，人民可以检举。
    青年朱成学、毛峥峨用解放前青年学生们所受的压迫，说明宪法草案中规定公民有言论、出版、集会、结社、游行、示威的自由的可贵。朱成学说：解放前南京市的学生，和全国人民一样，是没有任何自由的。反动组织密密层层包围着青年学生，那时只要你讲一句要求爱国和自由的话，就会遭到特务的迫害。至于集会、结社的自由，那更是
  一句空话。例如，伪中央大学学生自治会的人选，都是国民党反动派掌握的训导处指定的，后来，由于全国人民民主运动的发展，才由学生自己选举。但是，等到特务们竞选失败时，他们就要殴打进步学生，学校训导处就要解散自治会了。至于学生的校际组织——学联，那只能采取秘密活动的方式，更是没有半点自由。谈到集会、游行的自由时，朱成学说，一九四七年学生举行“反饥饿、反内战、反迫害”运动的游行，队伍行至珠江路口，特务就用水龙、皮鞭、木棍一齐向手无寸铁的学生打来，当场打伤学生三十余人，捕去十四人。他说，解放前的言论、集会、结社、游行自由受到的摧残就是这样。朱成学说：解放后不但有了人民自己的报刊，而且还有专门为青年办的报刊如“中国青年报”、“中国青年”等。学校里除了有班会、级会、学生会以外，还有许多科学性、文艺性的社团。每逢节日，青年学生们可以进行各种活动。这种自由、民主的生活，得来真是不容易啊！毛峥峨接着说：现在当我们回忆到国民党反动派对青年们的迫害时，许多尚未成年的青年，都认为这是不可理解的，但是这确实是他们的哥哥和姐姐们曾经过过的日子。现在，生活在新中国的青年是多么幸福啊，国家给他们筹办的学校一年比一年增多，青年们都能受到共产主义的教育和各种知识的教育，年满十八岁的人参加了选举活动，优秀的青年还被选为人民代表大会的代表。现在宪法草案规定国家要保障我们这些权利和自由，并且还要关怀我们体力和智力的发展，我们以后会过得更加幸福了。
    最后，对宪法草案中规定的国家要逐步扩大卫生事业设施，逐步扩大各种学校和其他文化教育机关，等等，大家也进行了讨论。陈凤云说：国家对我们劳动人民那么关切，我对宪法草案提出一个补充意见。我认为在第九十六条国家保护儿童和母亲的规定之后，应该再加一句：“并特别关怀多子女的母亲。”因为多子女的母亲困难比一般人多，更需要国家关怀。
    在讨论会中，每一个人都表示要为实现社会主义社会努力。
