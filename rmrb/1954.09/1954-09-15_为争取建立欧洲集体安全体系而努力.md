The Soviet Foreign Ministry issued a statement on September 10 regarding the French National Assembly's rejection of the "European Defence Community" treaty, reiterating its proposal to hold a Four-Power conference to discuss the German question and establish a European collective security system. This statement once again points out a clear path to maintaining peace in Europe and provides significant encouragement for the further peace efforts of the people of Europe and all peace-loving forces.

The French National Assembly's rejection of the "European Defence Community" treaty by an overwhelming majority is a victory for peace forces. Establishing an exclusive military bloc under the name of the "European Defence Community" to revive West German militarism was the cornerstone of the United States' policy of preparing for a new war in Europe after the war. Therefore, the US aggressive bloc has constantly coerced Western European countries, especially France, to accept this sinister policy in order to facilitate the US rearming of the former Hitler Wehrmacht in West Germany as its spearhead for launching a new war. The harm of this US policy to peace and security in Europe and the world is obvious. It will not only pose a direct threat to Germany's neighbors, especially France, but also greatly increase the threat of a new war in Europe, and thus increase the threat of a new world war. The patriotic forces of the European countries, including a broad stratum of the French people, firmly oppose the "European Defence Community" treaty. The French National Assembly's rejection of this treaty is the result of the long-term struggle of the French patriotic forces, and it also demonstrates the French people's firm will to cherish peace.

The rejection of the "European Defence Community" treaty is another major blow to the US war policy. This courageous action by the French patriotic forces not only conforms to the interests of ensuring France's true security and safeguarding French national independence, but also helps to consolidate the cause of peace in Europe and the world.

In the current situation, the call for resolving the German question on the principle of establishing a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany, and for establishing a European collective security system is even louder. In the past, one of the main obstacles on the road to resolving the German question and establishing a European collective security system was the US-engineered policy of establishing the "European Defence Community". The further bankruptcy of this policy has created new conditions for resolving the German question and establishing a European collective security system. After the French National Assembly rejected the "European Defence Community" treaty, French public opinion believed that convening a Four-Power conference to study the issue of German reunification should be placed on the top of the current agenda. The Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic also passed a resolution, pointing out that in order to ensure peace in Europe and achieve German reunification, a European collective security system should be established in which all European countries can participate equally. At the same time, it reiterated the proposal to hold all-German negotiations. Many political leaders in West Germany, including Erich Ollenhauer, chairman of the West German Social Democratic Party, also called for a Four-Power conference to discuss European security and the reunification of Germany. This vividly shows how deeply the Soviet Union's proposal to establish a European collective security system and to convene a Four-Power conference to discuss this issue and the German question conforms to the wishes of the people of Europe.

However, the US aggressive bloc and the ruling groups of other Western countries have not learned a lesson from the setback suffered by the "European Defence Community" policy, and are still trying to revive West German militarism in other ways. US Secretary of State Dulles, in a statement issued on August 31, stated that US rearmament of West Germany and the one-sided restoration of West Germany's "sovereignty," as well as the incorporation of certain institutions of Western European governments into "supranational institutions," were "unalterable" facts. The United States and other Western countries are making efforts either to establish a broader military bloc including Britain to replace the bankrupt "European Defence Community", or to drag West Germany directly into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. That is to say, they want to revive West German militarism under a new guise. However, this clumsy trick of the Western countries is obviously even more unworkable. Since the people of Europe and the people of France have recognized the danger of reviving West German militarism and rejected the "European Defence Community" treaty, it is unimaginable that attempts to revive West German militarism in another form will not encounter even more resolute opposition from the peace-loving forces of all countries.

Therefore, any Western European country has no reason to continue to accept the US policy of rearming West Germany, as long as it proceeds from its own national interests. This is especially of serious concern to France. France can only maintain its status as a major power and become an important factor in maintaining peace in Europe and the world in the context of the peaceful development of Europe and the establishment of a unified and peaceful Germany. European history has repeatedly proven that the emergence of a militaristic Germany will inevitably reduce France to a second-rate country and cause it to suffer serious damage. Therefore, for the sake of peace in Europe and the world, the peace-loving forces of all countries are willing to see a strong France that adopts an independent policy.

More and more facts prove that the Soviet-advocated proposition of establishing a European collective security system is the correct path to guarantee peace in Europe, and the peace-loving people of all countries must continue to strive to achieve this goal.

### 为争取建立欧洲集体安全体系而努力

    为争取建立欧洲集体安全体系而努力
    苏联外交部于九月十日就法国国民议会拒绝“欧洲防务集团”条约发表声明，重申举行四大国会议讨论德国问题和建立欧洲集体安全体系的主张。这个声明，再次指出了维护欧洲和平的明确道路，对于欧洲各国人民及一切爱好和平的力量进一步争取和平的努力，有着重大的鼓舞作用。
    法国国民议会以绝大多数票拒绝“欧洲防务集团”条约，是和平力量的胜利。在“欧洲防务集团”的名义下建立排他军事集团，以复活西德军国主义，是战后以来美国在欧洲推行的准备新战争政策的基石。因此，美国侵略集团曾不断胁迫西欧各国，特别是法国接受这种罪恶的政策，以便利美国重新武装西德的前希特勒国防军，作为它进行新战争的突击力量。美国的这种政策对欧洲和全世界的和平和安全的危害性是十分明显的。它不但将造成对德国的邻国、首先是法国的直接威胁，并且无比地增加欧洲新战争的威胁，因而也就增加新世界大战的威胁。欧洲各国人民包括法国的广泛阶层的爱国力量，坚决反对“欧洲防务集团”条约。法国国民议会拒绝了这个条约，这是法国爱国力量长期斗争的结果，同时也显示了法国人民爱好和平的坚强意志。
      “欧洲防务集团”条约的遭受否决，是对美国战争政策的又一重大打击。法国爱国力量的这一勇敢行动，不但符合于保证法国真正的安全和维护法国民族独立的利益，而且也有助于巩固欧洲和全世界的和平事业。
    在目前的形势下，要求以建立统一、和平、民主的德国为原则来解决德国问题，和建立欧洲集体安全体系的呼声是更加高涨了。过去在解决德国问题和建立欧洲集体安全体系的道路上的一个最主要的障碍，就是美国所策划的建立“欧洲防务集团”的政策。这种政策遭到进一步的破产，就为解决德国问题和建立欧洲集体安全体系创造了新的条件。在法国国民议会拒绝“欧洲防务集团”条约之后，法国的公众舆论就认为召开四大国会议以研究统一德国问题是提到当前首要的日程上来了。德意志民主共和国部长会议并通过决议，指出为了保障欧洲和平并实现德国的统一，应当建立所有欧洲国家都可以平等参加的欧洲集体安全体系。同时，并重申了举行全德谈判的建议。西德的许多政治领袖，包括西德社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔在内，也要求举行四国会议，讨论欧洲安全和重新统一德国的问题。这就生动地表明了，苏联关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的主张和召开四大国会议以讨论这个问题和德国问题的建议是如何深刻地符合于欧洲各国人民的愿望。
    但是，美国侵略集团及其他西方国家的统治集团却并没有从“欧洲防务集团”政策所遭受到的挫败中取得教训，而依然力图用其他方式复活西德军国主义。美国国务卿杜勒斯在八月三十一日发表的声明中，就曾表示美国重新武装西德和片面地恢复西德的“主权”，以及把西欧国家政府的某些机构并入“超国家机构”，都是“难以更改”的事实。美国和其他西方国家正在进行努力，或者建立一个包括英国在内的更广泛的军事集团，来代替已经破了产的“欧洲防务集团”，或者是把西德直接拖入北大西洋公约组织。这就是说，它们要在一种新的幌子下来重新复活西德军国主义。但是，西方国家的这种笨拙的骗术，显然是更加行不通了。因为，欧洲人民和法国人民既然认清了复活西德军国主义的危险而拒绝了“欧洲防务集团”条约，那末企图在另外一种形式下来复活西德军国主义而不遭到各国爱好和平力量更加坚决的反对，是不可想像的。
    因此，任何一个西欧国家，只要从自己的民族利益出发，都没有理由继续接受美国重新武装西德的政策。这对于法国尤其有着严重的利害关系。法国只有在欧洲的和平发展和建立起一个统一和平的德国的情形下，才能保持其大国的地位，并成为维护欧洲和世界和平的重要因素。欧洲的历史已经一再证明，一个军国主义德国的出现就必然会使法国降为二等国家，并使它遭受到严重的损害。因此，为了欧洲的和全世界的和平，各国爱好和平的力量都愿意看到一个采取独立政策的、强大的法国。
    越来越多的事实证明，苏联所倡导的建立欧洲集体安全体系的主张是保障欧洲和平的正确道路，各国爱好和平的人民必须继续为争取实现这个目标而奋斗。
