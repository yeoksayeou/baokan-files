The renovation of Huai Ren Tang has been completed ahead of schedule. The roof of the entrance hall has been re-covered with verdant glazed tiles, and the steps have been paved with marble. The red pillars of the palace gate, the screen wall inside the gate, and the corridor columns have all been renovated.

Oral translation will be provided for individual representatives using other minority languages.

During the meeting, the Central People's Broadcasting Station will broadcast live coverage of the main agenda items to the whole country.
