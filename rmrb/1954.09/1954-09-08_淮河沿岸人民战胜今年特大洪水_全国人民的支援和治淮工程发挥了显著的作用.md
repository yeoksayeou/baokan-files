Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, 7th: The Huai River flood control has achieved a decisive victory. After the lower reaches of the Huai River successfully passed the highest flood peak in late August and overcame the attack of level 7 to level 8 typhoons, the tense situation of the entire Huai River basin fighting the extraordinary flood began to stabilize in an all-round way. At present, the water levels of the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Huai River are rapidly decreasing. The water levels of all stations in the upper reaches have fallen below the warning water level. The weather in the Huai River basin has been clear recently, and the water levels are continuing to fall.

The people on both sides of the Huai River have fought arduously against this year's extraordinary flood for two months. At the height of the flood season, a total of more than 800,000 workers, soldiers, farmers, and cadres participated in the Huai River flood control. They guarded the Huai River dikes day and night, and generally widened and raised the dikes in the ensured areas by more than one meter. Hundreds of thousands of workers defending the dikes in the lower reaches of the Huai River carried out emergency repairs on the Hongze Lake Dam and the Subei Irrigation Main Canal Dam. On the nearly 300-li long canal line in northern Jiangsu Province, nearly 100,000 workers and people along the dikes built willow and stone revetments on the west bank of the canal to prevent wind and waves; and carried out reinforcement projects on the dangerous sections of the east bank of the canal. In late August, when the lower reaches of the Huai River were hit by a typhoon, tens of thousands of workers guarding the canal dikes fought the typhoon continuously for seventeen hours. In order to rush the transportation of flood control materials, almost all means of transportation that could participate in flood control on both sides of the Huai River were mobilized. Trains, cars, ships, and wooden boats carried various materials from all over the country to support the Huai River flood control and rushed to various work sections.

In defending against this year's extraordinary flood in the Huai River, the Huai River harnessing projects carried out in the past few years have played a significant role. At the beginning of the Huai River flood control, the Huai River Harnessing Committee had planned and systematically used the Huai River harnessing projects to intercept and store floodwaters step by step, and then opened the flood diversion areas to divert floods and the flood detention areas to detain floods; various methods were used to weaken the flood peak and ensure the safety of the dikes. At the most critical time of the flood, more than 20 billion cubic meters of floodwater had been intercepted above Hongze Lake. The huge Foziling Reservoir and the Sanhe Sluice and other projects have always controlled the flood freely. The nine lakes and depressions in the middle reaches of the Huai River were originally planned to store 7.03 billion cubic meters of floodwater, but this year's flood storage reached 12.45 billion cubic meters. The drainage capacity of the dozens of rivers that have been harnessed over the past few years has also been greatly strengthened in this year's flood control. The Suihe River and Tuohe River in Huaibei, Anhui Province, were dredged, the drainage was smooth, and the dikes were kept from collapsing.

Although this year's flood in the Huai River is far greater than that in 1931, most of the dikes in the areas of eastern Henan, northern Anhui, and northern Jiangsu, which were affected by the disaster in 1931, did not breach this year, and autumn crops are still growing vigorously. The workers of the Huainan Coal Mine on the south bank of the Huai River in Anhui Province are still mining coal as usual. Factories in Bengbu, Huaiyin, Huaian and other places along the Huai River are still producing as usual, and the market is as usual. The Jinpu Railway, which connects north and south transportation, is still open to traffic. These are the results of the Huai River harnessing in the past few years.

Now that the flood season in the Huai River has not ended, the slogan put forward by the standing workers defending the dikes everywhere is "Never withdraw troops until the Huai River flood is finally defeated."

    淮河沿岸人民战胜今年特大洪水
    全国人民的支援和治淮工程发挥了显著的作用
    据新华社蚌埠七日电：淮河防汛已取得决定性的胜利。淮河下游在八月下旬胜利渡过最高的洪水峰并战胜了七级到八级台风的袭击后，整个淮河流域和特大洪水进行斗争的紧张局势即开始全面平稳下来。目前，淮河上、中、下游的水位都在迅速下降。上游各站水位已全部下落到警戒水位以下。近日淮河流域天气晴朗，各处水位仍在继续下降。
    淮河两岸的人民和今年淮河特大洪水艰苦斗争了两个月。在汛情紧张的时候，参加淮河防汛的工人、部队战士、农民和机关干部共有八十多万人。他们日夜坚守在淮河堤防上，并且把确保地区的堤防普遍加宽加高了一公尺以上。防守在淮河下游各段堤防上的数十万民工，突击培修了洪泽湖大堤和苏北灌溉总渠堤防。江苏省北部近三百里长的运河线上，近十万民工和沿堤人民在运河西堤加筑柳石枕子埝，防风挡浪；在运河东堤做了险段的加固工程。八月下旬淮河下游遭台风袭击，坚守在运河堤上的数万民工和台风连续搏斗了十七小时。防汛中为了赶运防汛器材，淮河两岸几乎所有能够参加防汛的各种交通工具都被动员起来。火车、汽车、轮船和木船载运着全国各地人民支援淮河防汛的各种器材，向各个工段赶运。
    在防御今年淮河特大洪水中，几年来所做的治淮工程都发挥了显著作用。淮河防汛开始时，治淮委员会就有计划有步骤地运用治淮工程节节拦蓄洪水，接着又开放引洪区引洪，开放滞洪区滞洪；用各种办法减弱洪峰，保证了堤防的安全。在汛情最紧张的时候，洪泽湖以上曾拦滞二百多亿立方公尺的洪水。巨大的佛子岭水库和三河闸等工程都始终操纵自如地控制着洪水。淮河中游九个湖泊洼地原来计划蓄洪七十亿三千万公方，今年蓄洪量却达到一百二十四亿五千多万公方。几年来经过治理的几十条河道，今年防汛中排水能力也较过去大大加强。安徽省淮北的濉河、沱河，因为经过疏浚，排水通畅，保住堤防没有溃决。
    今年淮河的洪水虽远远大于一九三一年，但一九三一年受灾的豫东、皖北、苏北大部地区，今年绝大部分堤防没有决堤，秋庄稼仍然生长茂盛。安徽省淮河南岸的淮南煤矿的工人仍在照常采煤。淮河沿岸的蚌埠、淮阴、淮安等地的工厂仍然照常生产，市面如常。联系南北交通的津浦铁路也仍然通车。这些都是几年来治淮的效果。
    现在，淮河汛期还没有结束，防守在各处堤防的常备民工提出的口号是“不最后战胜淮河洪水决不收兵”。
