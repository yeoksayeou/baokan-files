Central Ministry of Textile Industry
Encourages Farmers to Ret Flax Fiber

    In order to increase raw materials for the textile industry, the Central Ministry of Textile Industry encourages farmers to ret large quantities of flax fiber.
    Hebei, Shanxi, Gansu, Qinghai provinces, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in our country all produce a large amount of flax. The main purpose of farmers in these areas in planting flax is to extract oil from the seeds, and only a few counties in the Northwest use flax fiber to weave sacks. The vast majority of farmers do not know how to extract the fiber from the flax stalks, and only use the stalks as firewood.
    In order to introduce the method of processing and retting flax to farmers in various flax-producing areas, and to encourage farmers to ret flax fiber and sell it to the state, so as to expand the source of raw materials for the flax textile industry, the Central Ministry of Textile Industry, together with the Yanbei Prefecture Commissioner's Office of Shanxi Province and the Yanbei Prefecture Office of the Shanxi Provincial Cooperative General Office, held a training class on flax processing and retting in Datong City in August and September this year. Through processing and retting experiments, a set of simple and feasible processing and retting methods has been summarized, and a group of cadres who can initially master the technology of retting flax have been trained.
    The Central Ministry of Textile Industry has also signed a flax fiber agency purchase agreement with the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and plans to purchase a large amount of flax fiber processed and retted by farmers.

    中央纺织工业部
    鼓励农民沤制胡麻纤维
    中央纺织工业部为增加纺织工业原料，鼓励农民大量沤制胡麻纤维。
    我国的河北、山西、甘肃、青海等省和内蒙古自治区，都出产大量的胡麻。这些地区的农民种胡麻的主要目的是取籽榨油，仅有西北少数县份利用胡麻纤维织制麻袋。绝大多数地区的农民不懂得怎样才能从胡麻秆上取下纤维，只把麻秆当柴烧。
    中央纺织工业部为了在各产胡麻地区向农民介绍加工沤制胡麻的方法，鼓励农民沤制胡麻纤维卖给国家，以扩大麻纺织工业的原料来源，特于今年八、九月间会同山西省雁北专署、山西省合作总社雁北专区办事处，在大同市开办了胡麻加工沤制训练班。通过加工沤制试验，已总结出一套简易可行的加工沤制方法，并训练出一批能初步掌握沤制胡麻技术的干部。
    中央纺织工业部并已和全国供销合作总社签订了胡麻纤维代购协议，计划大量收购农民加工沤制出来的胡麻纤维。
