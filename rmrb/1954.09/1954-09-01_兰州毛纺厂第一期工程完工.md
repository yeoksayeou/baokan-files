The first phase of construction of the Lanzhou Woolen Textile Factory has been fully completed.

Gansu Province's many pastoral areas produce large quantities of wool, but it cannot be processed locally. The Gansu Provincial People's Government began preparations for the construction of the Lanzhou Woolen Textile Factory in 1950. Now, the first phase of the project has been fully completed, and the installation of the new wool washing area, packing house, and some spinning frames has also been completed. The Lanzhou Woolen Textile Factory has now begun to test these machines for wool washing and packing, and has woven standard No. 10 yarn and No. 12 yarn tweed to supply the needs of the people's lives.

The designed capacity of the Lanzhou Woolen Textile Factory's baling machine is one bale every four minutes. Wool for export is baled here, eliminating the need for unpacking and re-baling en route, which reduces transport volume. At the same time, based on the factory's annual wool washing capacity, it can also reduce wool impurities by more than 3,000 tons. Calculated based on the train freight from Lanzhou to Tianjin, this can save the country more than 1 billion yuan in freight costs each year.

    兰州毛纺厂第一期工程完工
    兰州毛纺织厂第一期建设工程已全部完成。
    甘肃省许多牧区出产大量的羊毛，但不能就地加工。甘肃省人民政府从一九五零年起就着手筹建兰州毛纺织厂，现在第一期工程已全部完工，新的洗毛场、打包房和部分纺锭的安装工作也告完成。兰州毛纺织厂现已开始试用这些机器洗毛、打包，并织成了十号纱和十二号纱标准呢，供应人民生活的需要。
    兰州毛纺织厂打包机的设计能力，每四分钟可以打完一包，外运的羊毛经这里打包，不再需要中途拆包重打，减少了运输体积；同时以这个厂全年洗毛能力计算，还可减少羊毛杂质三千余吨，以兰州到天津的火车运费计算，每年即可为国家节约运费十余亿元。
