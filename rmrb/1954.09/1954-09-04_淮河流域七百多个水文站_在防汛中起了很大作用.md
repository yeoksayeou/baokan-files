More than 700 hydrological stations in the Huai River Basin closely monitored the water situation, playing a significant role in conquering the extraordinary floods in the Huai River Basin this year. These more than 700 hydrological stations submit more than one thousand water situation reports to the Huai River Flood Control Headquarters every day. The Huai River Flood Control Headquarters analyzes and judges these water situation reports every day and even every hour, thereby issuing various instructions, orders, and forecasts of flood development. Reservoirs and sluices in the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Huai River promptly and proactively intercepted, stored, and detained floodwaters. Embankments along the river were also heightened and reinforced in a timely manner, orderly conquering this year's extraordinary floods.

This year, a total of more than 1,200 technical cadres and surveyors participated in the hydrological work of the Huai River. During the intense flood control efforts, these hydrological workers played an active and combative role in their work to accurately record various hydrological data such as water level, flow rate, and rainfall. They completed their tasks time and time again in the face of violent winds and rain, and amidst turbulent waves. The staff of the Qinggou District Hydrological Station persisted in the wind and rain for five days and five nights to accurately record the highest flood peak. Comrades measuring flow, unable to work in raincoats soaked with rain, simply took off their raincoats and worked bare-backed. The houses of the Tianjia'an Hydrological Station were flooded, and the staff of the hydrological station persisted in measuring rainfall on boats. Some risked their lives, riding small boats, drifting on the torrential currents, to measure the flood peak. (Xinhua News Agency)

    淮河流域七百多个水文站
    在防汛中起了很大作用
    分布在淮河流域的七百多个水文站，严密掌握水情，对今年淮河流域战胜特大洪水起了很大作用。这七百多个水文站每天向淮河防汛指挥机关所作的水情报告有一千份以上。淮河防汛指挥机关每一天以至每一小时都根据这些水情报告进行分析、判断，从而发出各种指示、命令和洪水发展情况的预报。淮河上、中、下游各处水库和水闸都及时主动地拦洪、蓄洪、滞洪。沿河堤防也适时地作了加高加固工程，有条不紊地战胜了今年特大洪水。
    今年参加淮河水文工作的技术干部和测工共有一千二百多人。在紧张的防汛中，这些水文工作者为了把水位、流量、雨量各种水文资料十分准确地记录下来，都在工作中发挥了积极的战斗作用。他们在狂风暴雨之下，在惊涛骇浪之中，一次又一次地完成了任务。青沟区水文站的工作人员，为了准确地记下最高洪水峰，整整在风雨中坚持了五天五夜。测流量的同志，雨天穿着湿透了的雨衣无法工作，就干脆脱掉雨衣光着背脊干起来。田家庵水文站的房子被洪水淹了，水文站的工作人员就住在船上坚持着测雨量。有的冒着生命危险，坐着小船，飘荡在激流之上，去测量洪水峰。　（新华社）
