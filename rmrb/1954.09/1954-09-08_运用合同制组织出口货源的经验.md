Experience in Organizing Export Goods with the Contract System
　　Feng Ning
    In 1953, the Northwest Branch of the China Native Produce Export Company used the contract system to organize goods for export, completing 162% of the annual purchase plan. The number of export varieties also increased from the originally planned 21 to 33. This achieved certain results in expanding export sources, increasing the income of farmers and herdsmen, and supporting national economic construction.
    In 1953, the Northwest Branch of the China Native Produce Export Company had no lower-level organizations, and only fifty cadres. The company closely relied on the local trade companies and cooperatives in various regions. Based on the overall export plan and combined with the sales requirements of farmers and herdsmen in the region, it signed a large number of contracts with local trade companies and cooperatives and other sources of goods in the Northwest on behalf of various port companies. More than 93% of the purchases were made by cooperatives. After the contracts were signed, the company also focused on carrying out the following series of organizational and inspection work, thus overfulfilling its task.
    (1) Take the initiative to closely cooperate and strengthen ties with local trade companies and cooperatives. For example, leading comrades of the Gansu Provincial Trade Company often instructed their subordinate units to resolutely act in accordance with the contracts, and urged the implementation of the contracts through notices, commendations, and other methods. The Northwest Branch of the China Native Produce Export Company sent personnel to the producing areas to assist trade companies and cooperatives in solving transportation and funding problems when native products were on the market in large quantities. These efforts promoted and guaranteed the execution of the contracts, and also strengthened the relationship between domestic and foreign trade units and cooperatives.
    (2) Under the leadership and support of the local Party and government, conduct in-depth investigation and research to vigorously organize production. For example, the planned purchase quantity of cork raw materials (cork bark) was larger than the original planned figure of the production department. The production department did not immediately accept the supply task due to the lack of accurate output figures. The Northwest Branch of the China Native Produce Export Company provided information to the Northwest Financial and Economic Commission for research. At the same time, the Northwest Special Representative Office of the Ministry of Foreign Trade, together with the Commercial Department and other relevant units, formed a working group to conduct on-site surveys. After confirming that logging could be expanded, it cooperated with the production department to organize mass production and organized trade companies and cooperatives to purchase. This not only ensured the realization of the export plan, but also helped the local people overcome disasters and won a good response from the masses.
    (3) Pay attention to helping local trade companies and cooperatives improve and enhance the specifications and quality of export native products. For example, the previous year's hemp was unsalable due to poor degumming. The Northwest Branch of the China Native Produce Export Company sent cadres to Tianjin and Baotou to study and research improved degumming methods, and accepted the opinions of Soviet experts and the Tianjin Branch on the inspection of Northwest hemp. It implemented new processing methods, compiled publicity materials on "Problems and Improvement Suggestions for Northwest Hemp," and promoted them to farmers through grassroots trade companies and cooperatives in the producing areas. At the beginning of hemp purchasing, personnel were sent to key areas to assist in quality identification, making the quality of hemp improved compared to 1952.
    (4) Appropriately adjust contract prices according to actual conditions. For example, the prices of medicinal materials and other products changed greatly in the third quarter, and the difference with the original contract prices was very large, affecting the implementation of the contracts. After consultation with local trade companies, with the consent of the port companies, and with the approval of the Northwest Special Representative Office of the Ministry of Foreign Trade, the prices of more than ten kinds of native products, such as beeswax, angelica, and gentiana macrophylla, were adjusted twice, ensuring the smooth implementation of the contracts and eliminating the fear of losses among purchasing units. The contract quantities were also increased. For example, Gansu Province increased the contract for 100,000 jin of angelica and 10,000 jin of gentiana macrophylla, among other contracts.
    (5) In the third and fourth quarters of 1953, with the arrival of the peak season for native products, the Northwest Branch of the China Native Produce Export Company categorized the contract commodities and organized working groups to go deep into the producing areas three times to check and urge delivery. Most of the contracts were delivered on time, in quantity, and in quality. For example, in December last year, the Minxian Trade Company in Gansu Province completed the delivery of 190,000 jin of native products on schedule within five days, and all of the angelica, which accounted for the largest value, met export standards.
    Due to the importance and efforts of all relevant departments in implementing the contracts, the contracts executed throughout the year accounted for more than 81% of the total contract value, promoting and guaranteeing the realization of the national import and export plan. Moreover, most of the contracts were delivered on time, in quantity, and in quality, establishing a good commercial reputation.
    However, some contracts were not fulfilled. The main reasons were insufficient understanding of the production and sales situation in the region, and some of the contract terms were unrealistic, difficult to implement, and even caused disputes during implementation. This should be improved in future work.

    运用合同制组织出口货源的经验
  　酆宁
    中国土产出口公司西北分公司一九五三年运用合同制组织货源，完成了全年收购计划百分之一百六十二，出口品种亦由原计划的二十一种增为三十三种，对扩大出口货源、增加农牧民收入、支援国家经济建设都有一定成绩。
    一九五三年中国土产出口公司西北分公司没有下层机构，干部也不过五十人。该公司紧紧地依靠各地方贸易公司和合作社，根据总的出口计划，结合区内农牧民的推销要求，代替各口岸公司与西北区各地方贸易公司和合作社及其他货源单位签订了大批合同，其中由合作社购进的占购进总值百分之九十三以上。在合同签订以后，该公司又抓紧进行了以下一系列的组织和检查工作，因而超额完成了任务。
    （一）主动与各地方贸易公司、合作社密切配合，加强联系。如甘肃省贸易公司领导同志经常指示所属单位坚决按合同办事，并以通报、表扬等方式督促合同的执行。中国土产出口公司西北分公司则在土产大量上市时派员到产地协助贸易公司和合作社解决运输及资金问题。这些工作推动和保证了合同的执行，也使内外贸易、合作社等单位的关系密切了。
    （二）在当地党政的领导和支持下，深入调查研究大力组织生产。如软木原料（栓皮）的计划收购数量较生产部门原定的计划数字大，生产部门因缺乏切实的产量数字，没有立即接受供应任务。中国土产出口公司西北分公司一面提供情况给西北财政经济委员会研究，一面由中央对外贸易部西北特派员办事处会同商业厅等有关单位组成工作组，进行实地勘查，证实能够扩大采伐后，即配合生产部门组织群众生产，并组织贸易公司和合作社收购。这样不但保证了出口计划的实现，并且也帮助了当地群众度过灾荒，获得群众的良好反映。
    （三）注意帮助地方贸易公司和合作社提高与改进出口土产的规格和质量。如前年的大麻因脱胶不良而滞销，中国土产出口公司西北分公司就派干部赴天津、包头学习，研究改进脱胶方法，并接受苏联专家和天津分公司对西北大麻检验的意见，实行新法加工，编印“西北大麻存在的问题及改进意见”的宣传材料，通过产区基层贸易公司、合作社向农民进行宣传。在大麻开始收购时，即派员到重点区协助鉴别质量，使大麻质量比一九五二年有了改进。
    （四）根据实际情况，适当地调整了合同价格。如第三季度药材等价格变化甚大，与原订合同价格相差很大，影响合同的执行。经过与地方贸易公司共同协商，征得口岸公司同意，并报请对外贸易部西北特派员办事处批准，计先后两次调整了黄蜡、当归、秦艽等十余种土产价格，保证了合同的顺利实现，并消除了收购单位的怕赔钱思想，增订了合同数量，如甘肃省增订了当归十万斤，秦艽一万斤等数宗合同。
    （五）一九五三年三、四季度中，随着土产旺季的到来，中国土产出口公司西北分公司对合同商品进行了站队，并组织工作组三次深入产区进行检查和督促交拨。使绝大部分合同均做到了按期、按数、按质交货，如去年十二月甘肃省岷县贸易公司在五天之内，如期完成了十九万斤土产交货任务，而且占最大数值的当归全部都符合出口标准。
    由于各有关部门对合同执行的重视和努力，使全年已执行的合同占合同总值的百分之八十一以上，促进与保证了国家进出口计划的实现，而且绝大部分合同均做到了按期、按量、按质交货，树立了良好的商业信誉。
    但也有一些合同未能完成。原因主要是对区内产销情况了解不够，合同的条件有些不切实际，不易执行，甚至在履行时发生争执。这是应该在今后工作中加以改进的。
