　　Xinhua News Agency, London, 28th—A meeting attended by nine countries including the United States, Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Canada is scheduled to be held in London starting on the 28th. The purpose of this meeting is to seek a new plan to arm West Germany to replace the bankrupt "European Defense Community" treaty.

　　Although rearming West Germany is a common goal of the participating countries, the strong opposition of Western European public opinion to the revival of German militarism has so far prevented the governments of the United States, Britain, and France from reaching a unanimously agreed-upon plan on the method and steps for arming West Germany. Therefore, Reuters said some time ago that this nine-nation meeting "will not be a mere 'rubber-stamping' of agreements already reached through diplomatic channels." Sources anticipate that at the London meeting, the United States will do everything possible to pressure the meeting to agree to the goal that the United States has consistently pursued since the "European Defense Community" treaty was rejected by the French National Assembly: allowing West Germany to participate in the North Atlantic Group with "full equality," that is, granting West Germany the right to arm itself without any restrictions.

　　U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, in his speech upon arriving in London on the 26th, used blatant pressure for this purpose, demanding that Western countries "act quickly," and saying that otherwise, "the situation may become quite bad." The United Press said that Dulles was "clearly warning Europe in a 'this is the last chance' tone."

　　Although Dulles claimed that "the United States did not bring any pre-arranged plans to London," according to a United Press dispatch from Washington on the 26th, Dulles was carrying several "attitude-indicating documents" with him, "If Dulles feels that the London negotiations are lagging, he may pull out one or several of these documents from his pocket to show his European colleagues the possible future." This so-called "possible future" means that "the process of reducing American investment in manpower, equipment, and money in Western Europe will begin before the end of the year."

　　The main target of Dulles's threat is France, where public opinion has repeatedly expressed strong opposition to the revival of German militarism in any form. The day after Dulles arrived in London, he held a conversation with French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mendès France. According to the United Press, Dulles indicated during the conversation that the outcome of the nine-nation meeting may determine whether the United States must make a "painful reassessment" of its obligations and strategy for European "defense." Coordinating with this statement, the American propaganda machine also released various messages indicating that the United States would arm West Germany regardless of everything. For example, the Associated Press said a few days ago that U.S. military and diplomatic officials are drafting various plans "to cope with possible needs," including "proceeding with the organization of German military forces regardless of France's unwillingness."

### 美英等九国在伦敦举行会议  策划重新武装西德的新方案

    美英等九国在伦敦举行会议
    策划重新武装西德的新方案
    【新华社二十八日讯】伦敦消息：由美国、英国、法国、西德、意大利、荷兰、比利时、卢森堡和加拿大九国参加的会议定于二十八日起在伦敦举行。这次会议的目的是要寻求一个武装西德的新方案，以代替破产了的“欧洲防务集团”条约。
    虽然重新武装西德是与会各国的共同目标，但是，西欧公众对于德国军国主义复活的强烈反对，使得美、英、法各国政府间迄今无法在武装西德的方法与步骤上达成一个一致同意的方案。因此，路透社在前些时候说：这次九国会议“将不能是在已经通过外交途径达成的协议上‘盖盖章’就算完事”。各方消息预料，在伦敦会议上，美国将尽一切可能压迫会议同意美国在“欧洲防务集团”条约被法国国民议会拒绝后所一贯追求的目标：允许西德能以“完全平等”的地位参加北大西洋集团，也就是说，给予西德以不受任何限制武装起来的权利。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯在二十六日到达伦敦时发表的演说中，为这个目的而使用了露骨的压力，他要求西方各国“迅速行动起来”，并且说，不然的话，“局势可能变得相当糟”。合众社说，杜勒斯是在“用一种‘这是最后一次机会’的语调明白地警告欧洲。”
    虽然杜勒斯宣称“美国并没有携带任何预先安排好的计划到伦敦来”，但是，据合众社二十六日从华盛顿发出的消息透露，杜勒斯却随身带着若干
  “表明态度的文件”，“如果杜勒斯觉得伦敦谈判迟滞不前，他就可能从他的口袋里掏出一个或几个这种文件来，让他的欧洲同僚看一看可能的前途。”这种所谓“可能的前途”意味着“减少美国对西欧的人力、装备和金钱的投资的过程将在年底以前开始。”
    杜勒斯这种威胁的主要对象是公众舆论已经一再表示强烈反对在任何形式下复活德国军国主义的法国。杜勒斯到达伦敦的第二天就和法国总理兼外交部长孟戴斯—弗朗斯作了一次谈话。据合众社报道，杜勒斯曾在谈话中表示：九国会议的结果可能会决定美国是否必须对欧洲“防务”的义务和战略作出“忍痛重新估计”。配合着这种说法，美国宣传机关也放出了各种各样的消息，表示美国将不顾一切地武装西德。例如，美联社在前两天就说：美国的军事和外交官员正在拟订各种各样的方案“以应付可能的需要”。其中包括，“不顾法国的不愿意，就着手组织德国军事部队。”
