Xinhua News Agency, Leipzig, 6th. The opening ceremony of the 1954 Leipzig International Fair was held at 8:00 PM on September 4th at the Leipzig Municipal Theater. Those attending the opening ceremony included: Johannes Dieckmann, Chairman of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic; Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl; diplomatic envoys from various countries to Germany; government delegations from Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria; representatives from thirty-three countries participating in the exhibition; representatives from West German industrial and commercial circles participating in the exhibition; representatives from government organs of the German Democratic Republic; and labor models.

Prime Minister Grotewohl spoke at the opening ceremony. He said, "The successful conclusion of the Geneva Conference has brought about a relaxation in the international situation. In developing the peaceful coexistence of all peoples, trade is a great medium." He then explained in detail the significance of the Leipzig Fair as an important link in promoting understanding between East and West Germany and for the further prosperity of the democratic world market. He said, "The foreign trade of the countries that constitute this new world market serves entirely peaceful and democratic construction." These guaranteed and regular exchanges of goods enable not only the countries of the peace camp, but also other countries, to obtain equipment and raw materials from the two huge, economically immeasurable countries of the Soviet Union and China. This cannot be obtained in the capitalist world market. Therefore, the new democratic world market is strongly attractive to countries that want to get rid of American economic control. ... The Fair is also an instrument for establishing normal relations between the democratic world market and the capitalist world market." Grotewohl mentioned the Soviet Union's suggestion to conclude a multilateral economic agreement with all European countries, saying: "Such an economic agreement would ensure that no unilateral economic hegemony occurs in Europe, that trade between East and West can be conducted without restriction, and that the ruthless economic struggle between capitalist competitors is alleviated, thereby reducing the threat of war associated with it. The implementation of this proposal will also help the German people stop the remilitarization of West Germany, because normal economic cooperation is incompatible with the militarization of the economy and the consolidation of armaments."

Grotewohl pointed out that many economic figures in Western Europe see the enormous potential of trading with this new market of one billion people. He went on to say: "With the participation of twenty-one capitalist countries, the Leipzig Fair has once again become a traditional international trade center and has further expanded its new role as a link between East and West trade." He then announced that due to the development of foreign trade in the German Democratic Republic, the exhibition area of this year's Fair has been greatly expanded. From 1955 onwards, the Leipzig Fair will resume being held twice a year, with the spring fair being a sample and technology exhibition and the autumn fair being only a sample exhibition.

Next, Grotewohl elaborated on the achievements of economic construction in the German Democratic Republic as demonstrated at the Fair. He said: In the German Democratic Republic, "the three basic industrial sectors of metal smelting, heavy machinery manufacturing, and shipbuilding have now been completely established. Therefore, since the announcement of the new policy in 1953, great efforts have been made to develop the production of consumer goods. In the whole year of 1953 and the first half of 1954, the state allocated a total of 3.02 billion marks to reduce prices, increase wages, reduce taxes, and provide loans to farmers and handicraftsmen. As a result, people's lives have been greatly improved, and purchasing power has been greatly increased."

Then, amidst thunderous applause, Grotewohl announced the decision to implement the sixteenth price reduction in the German Democratic Republic, starting on September 6th.

    一九五四年来比锡国际博览会开幕
    【新华社来比锡六日电】一九五四年来比锡国际博览会于九月四日晚八时在来比锡市立大戏院举行开幕典礼。参加开幕典礼的有：德意志民主共和国人民议院主席狄克曼、总理格罗提渥，各国驻德外交使节，波、捷、匈、罗、保等国政府代表团，三十三个国家的参加展览会的代表，西德参加展出的工商业界代表，德意志民主共和国政府机关代表和劳动模范等。
    格罗提渥总理在开幕典礼上讲了话。他说：“日内瓦会议胜利结束给国际局势带来了缓和。在发展各国人民间的和平共处中，贸易是一个极大的媒介。”接着，他详细说明来比锡博览会作为促进东西德之间谅解的一个重要纽带和对民主世界市场进一步繁荣的意义。他说：构成这一新的世界市场的国家的对外贸易是完全为和平和民主的建设服务的。”这些有保证和有规律的货物交流不仅使和平阵营各国，而且也使其他国家，能够从苏联和中国这两个巨大的、经济上不可计量的国家获得装备和原料。这是资本主义世界市场上所得不到的。因此，新的民主世界市场对于那些想摆脱美国经济控制的国家具有强大的吸引力。……博览会也是民主世界市场及资本主义世界市场之间建立正常关系的工具。”格罗提渥提到苏联所建议的缔结一个所有欧洲国家多方面的经济协定时说：“这种经济协定将使在欧洲不再发生任何单方面的经济独霸的情况，将使东西方贸易可以无限制地进行，减轻资本主义竞争者之间无情的经济斗争，从而减轻与此有关的战争威胁。实现这个建议也将帮助德国人民制止西德重新军国主义化，因为正常的经济合作是与经济的军事化和整顿军备不相容的。”
    格罗提渥指出西欧许多经济界人士看到了与这十亿人民所组成的新的市场进行贸易的巨大可能性。他接着说：“由于二十一个资本主义国家的参加，来比锡博览会又成为传统的国际贸易中心了，并更加扩大了它作为联系东方和西方贸易的新的作用。”随后，他宣布：由于德意志民主共和国对外贸易的发展，今年博览会展览面积已经大大扩大。从一九五五年起，来比锡博览会将恢复一年举行两次，春季是样品和技术展览，秋季只是样品展览。
    接着，格罗提渥详细说明了在博览会中所表现的德意志民主共和国经济建设的成就。他说：在德意志民主共和国，“今天五金冶炼、重型机器制造和造船这三个基本工业部门已经完全建立起来了。因此，从一九五三年宣布新方针以来，才能大力发展消费品生产。一九五三年全年和一九五四年上半年，国家为了减低物价、提高工资、减税和给农民、手工业者贷款，总共拨出三十亿零二百万马克。因此人民生活大大改善，购买力已大大提高了。”
    接着，格罗提渥在雷动的掌声中宣布了从九月六日开始在德意志民主共和国实行第十六次降低物价的决定。
