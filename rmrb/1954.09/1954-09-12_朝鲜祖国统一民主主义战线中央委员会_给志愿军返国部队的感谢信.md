To the commanders and fighters of the returning Chinese People's Volunteer Army:

We extend our heartfelt thanks and respect to our comrades-in-arms who have established immortal feats in the war against the armed aggression of US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique, defending the freedom, independence, and honor of our country, and who are about to return home.

When the Korean people were in the most difficult and painful period, you raised the banner of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, and entered the fighting Korea with righteous steps, which immediately turned our country from danger to safety at a difficult and critical juncture.

The people of Korea and China, with the sacred Mt. Paektu as a symbol of our eternal friendship, have been united together since ancient times along the Yalu and Tumen Rivers. From then on, we became even closer revolutionary comrades-in-arms formed by flesh and blood, and established great feats of annihilating the enemy, which will forever shine in the history of our country.

On those high grounds where even the rocks were burning, you, fighting bravely, cooperated with our heroic Korean People's Army to stubbornly eliminate the enemy; in the river-crossing operations that braved the rain of bullets and destroyed the enemy's positions, you showed unparalleled heroism; in the solemn struggle against the common enemy, US imperialism, you strengthened the belief that the aggressors would be defeated. For the freedom and happiness of our people, you spared no effort to give everything most precious.

In the five battles from October 25, 1950, to the end of May 1951, in the Battle of Shangganling in October and November 1952, in the counterattack on the central front in mid-July 1953, and in all previous battles, the brave commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army defended every inch of our country's land with their blood.

In particular, our Korean people will always remember the countless heroic battalions, companies, and platoons like the Yang Gensi Hero Company, and the thousands upon thousands of combat heroes and models like the special-class hero and special-class meritorious service winner Huang Jiguang, who sacrificed himself to block the enemy's heavy machine gun fire and ensure victory. Together with our Korean People's Army, they set a lofty example of patriotism and heroism.

The lofty spirit of self-sacrifice and fearlessness displayed by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army became one of the decisive factors for the Korean people to achieve a historic victory in the final battle to defeat the aggressors, and made a great contribution to defending peace in the Far East and combating the aggressors' conspiracy to provoke a new war.

The spirit of friendship displayed by the brave Chinese People's Volunteer Army is not limited to the front.

The Korean people will forever sing the great deeds of the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people, such as martyrs Luo Shengjiao and Wang Yongwei, as magnificent examples.

You regarded our joy as your own joy, our pain as your own pain, and together with us ignited hatred for the enemy's atrocities.

You saved your military rations to distribute to our war victims, used the gaps in fierce battles to help our farmers transplant rice seedlings, weed, and harvest, and made selfless efforts in restoring reservoirs destroyed by enemy aircraft, repairing railways and bridges, and restoring power plants.

Our closest friends—the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army—have been sincerely helping the Korean people in the post-war period to strengthen the democratic base, just as they did during the war.

In the devastated democratic base of Pyongyang and many other cities, on the construction sites of beautiful buildings, factories, streets, and residences that are rising again, our comrades who once fought bravely with guns and grenades in their hands are building alongside our people, brick by brick, so that our children can sing "General Kim Il-sung's Song" and "The East is Red" in new school buildings filled with sunshine.

Dear commanders and fighters of the returning Chinese People's Volunteer Army:

You are now leaving an unparalleled camaraderie to the Korean people, and are preparing to leave our country and return to your long-missed motherland.

Your names will become the most precious thing to our people and will forever remain in our hearts. The seeds of assistance you have sown for us will grow luxuriantly in our happy garden and will bear glorious fruits.

The great friendship between the people of Korea and China, like the two great rivers of the Yalu and Tumen Rivers flowing between our countries and China for thousands of years and converging into the sea, will forever radiate brilliant light.

The friendship and unity between the people of Korea and China, known as a symbol of the new era arriving in the East, has been further consolidated in the history of long-term revolutionary struggle and the fierce flames of the war against the American aggressors, and has become an invincible force in the world.

The US ruling clique and the Syngman Rhee gang, who cannot see this powerful force, still want to disturb peace and are creating various conspiracies to create tension in Korea.

However, the power of the united people will surely be able to shatter any adventure and plan of the enemy. The Korean people will surely be able to achieve their long-cherished wish—the peaceful reunification of our country.

Long live the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army!

Long live the unbreakable friendship and unity between the great Chinese people and the Korean people!

The Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front

    朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会
    给志愿军返国部队的感谢信中国人民志愿军返国部队指挥员、战斗员同志们：
    我们谨向在反对美帝国主义武装侵略和李承晚匪帮、维护我们祖国的自由、独立和荣誉的战争中建立了不朽功勋即将返国的战友们，致以衷心的感谢和敬意。
    当朝鲜人民处在最艰难困苦的时期，你们高举抗美援朝的旗帜，以正义的步伐进入了战斗着的朝鲜，使处在艰苦而严重的关头的我国立即转危为安。
    朝中两国人民以长白山圣地为我们永恒友谊的象征，傍着奔流的鸭绿江和图们江，从古以来就团结在一起，从此并成了以血肉结成的更为亲密的革命战友，建立了大量歼灭敌人的、在我们祖国的历史上永远放射光芒的伟大功勋。
    在那连岩石也在燃烧的高地上，英勇战斗的你们配合英勇的我们朝鲜人民军，顽强地消灭了敌人；在冒着枪林弹雨、摧毁敌军阵地的渡河作战中，显示了无比的英雄主义精神；在反对共同敌人美帝国主义的庄严斗争中，坚定了打败侵略者的必胜的信念。为了我们人民的自由和幸福，你们不惜付出最宝贵的一切。
    在一九五零年十月二十五日到一九五一年五月下旬期间所进行的五次战役中，在一九五二年十月和十一月间的上甘岭反击战中，在一九五三年七月中旬中部战线的反击战以及历次的战斗中，勇敢的中国人民志愿军指挥员、战斗员以鲜血坚守了我们祖国的每一寸土地。
    特别是我们朝鲜人民永远牢记着杨根思英雄连这样不可胜数的英雄营、连、排和舍身堵塞敌重机枪口、保证了胜利的特级英雄、特等功臣黄继光同志这样的成千成万的战斗英雄和模范们，他们和我们朝鲜人民军一起树立了崇高的爱国主义和英雄主义的榜样。
    中国人民志愿军所发挥的这种崇高的自我牺牲和英勇无畏的精神，在打败侵略者的最后决战中成了使朝鲜人民能取得历史性胜利的决定性的因素之一，在捍卫远东和平、打击侵略者挑拨新战争的阴谋方面作出了伟大的贡献。
    勇敢的中国人民志愿军所发挥的友爱精神并不限于前方。
    朝鲜人民将把中国人民的优秀儿女罗盛教、王永维等烈士的伟大事迹，作为壮丽的榜样永远歌唱。
    你们把我们的喜悦当作自己的喜悦，把我们的痛苦当作自己的痛苦，和我们共同燃起了对敌人的暴行的仇恨。
    你们节省自己的军粮分给我们的战争灾民、利用激烈战斗的空隙帮助我们农民插秧、除草、秋收，在恢复被敌机破坏的水库、修复铁道和桥梁、恢复发电厂等工作中进行了忘我的努力。
    我们最亲密的朋友——中国人民志愿军指挥员、战斗员们在战后时期，也像战时一样地为了加强民主基地而诚心诚意地帮助朝鲜人民进行恢复建设。
    在被敌人破坏不堪的民主策源地平壤市和其他许多城市中，在重新站起来的美丽的建筑物、工厂和大街、住宅等建设工地上，曾经紧握着枪杆和手榴弹而奋勇战斗的我们的战友，和我们人民并肩砌砖，进行建设，使我们的子女得以在充满阳光的新校舍里高唱“金日成将军之歌”和“东方红”。
    亲爱的中国人民志愿军返国部队指挥员、战斗员同志们：
    你们现在给朝鲜人民留下了无可比拟的战友爱，正准备离开我国，返回你们想念已久的祖国。
    你们的名字将成为我们人民最高贵的东西，而永远留在我们的心海中。你们给我们散播的援助种籽将在我们幸福的花园里茂盛地生长，并将结出光辉的果实。
    朝中两国人民的伟大友谊像千秋万代地奔流在我们祖国和中国之间的鸭绿江和图们江这两条巨流同归大海一样，它将永远放射出灿烂的光芒。
    被称为东方到来新时代的象征的朝中两国人民的友谊团结，在长期革命斗争的历史和反对美国侵略者的激烈的战争火焰里更加巩固起来了，并且成了世界上不可战胜的力量。
    看不到这种强大力量的美国统治集团和李承晚匪帮现在还想扰乱和平，为了在朝鲜制造紧张局势而在制造着各种阴谋活动。
    但是，团结起来的人民的力量一定能够粉碎敌人的任何冒险行动和计划。朝鲜人民一定能够争取实现自己的宿愿——我们祖国的和平统一。
    英勇的中国人民志愿军万岁！
    伟大的中国人民和朝鲜人民牢不可破的友谊团结万岁！
    朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会
