The heavy machinery manufacturing plants and mining machinery plants across the country bear the significant task of manufacturing a large number of equipment for key projects, as well as manufacturing equipment for other factories and mines that serve these projects. Under the leadership of the Party and with the help of Soviet experts, the staff and workers of heavy and mining machinery manufacturing plants across the country have achieved certain successes in fulfilling this task. In the past year, they have manufactured cone crushers weighing 60 tons, short cylinder ball mills weighing 61 tons, 210-kilowatt winches, large rolls with a diameter of 960 millimeters for the non-ferrous metal industry and Anshan Iron and Steel Company, vulcanization tanks for rubber factories, 60-ton tippers for mines, and 1,000-meter drilling rigs for geological departments. They are now manufacturing 100-ton molten iron ladles, 120-ton steel ingot mold transport vehicles, and 16.5 cubic meter slag pot carriers for key construction projects such as Anshan Iron and Steel Company, as well as various gate valves with diameters ranging from 500 millimeters to 1,500 millimeters. This year, they will also manufacture steam turbine reduction gears with 5,530 revolutions per minute for power plants. These are relatively large and relatively precise complete sets of equipment or accessories. The manufacturing of these machines and equipment not only plays an active role in ensuring the construction of key projects, but also continuously promotes the improvement of manufacturing technology in China's machinery industry.

In the task of completing orders for key construction projects, the leading cadres of some enterprises personally arrange tasks, organize forces, lead employees to analyze the technical standards and performance requirements of products, and actively strive for the cooperation of brother factories with a responsible spirit, solving many difficult problems in technology and materials. Therefore, they have completed the orders for key construction projects in terms of both time and quality. However, many enterprise leading cadres have not yet established the concept of serving key construction projects. Some enterprises emphasize specialization, only seeing the difficulties of their own units and not seeing the difficulties of the state in carrying out basic construction; others make things difficult for ordering units by demanding tools, materials, wood molds, and even proposing a series of requirements such as reducing quality and delaying delivery time. In short, they are unwilling to accept orders, especially those sporadic and temporary emergency orders, without going through several twists and turns and haggling.

Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant has many heavy machinery and equipment that other factories do not have, so many equipment orders for key construction projects have to be manufactured and coordinated by the plant. It is inevitable that the state has many and urgent requirements for the plant. However, individual leading cadres of the plant have not fully recognized this point. Instead of actively taking on this glorious task, they describe the state's requirements for the plant as the requirements for restaurants and shops, and refer to the ordering units contacting the plant for orders as "attacking bunkers." Under this erroneous understanding, not long ago, when the superior leading agency asked the plant to cooperate with Dalian Engineering and Mining Vehicle Plant in forging axles for 16.5 cubic meter slag pot carriers for Anshan Iron and Steel Company, they delayed making preparations and made things difficult for the ordering unit with other excuses. Although Dalian Crane Factory accepted the oil tank order task of a certain ministry, it did not agree to the ordering unit's spot check of product quality before delivery. The above-mentioned ideas of enterprise leading cadres are one of the main reasons why the orders for basic construction projects cannot be completed well now.

Poor product quality also hinders support for key construction projects. For example, the 30-meter and 50-meter drilling rigs manufactured by Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant have structural design errors, poor manufacturing quality, and have not been subjected to a complete set of finished product performance tests. As a result, users found problems as soon as they tried the vehicle, and they still cannot be put into production. Poor product quality is generally concentrated in castings, forgings, and processed parts. When Dalian Engineering and Mining Vehicle Plant manufactured 60-ton tippers in January this year, it scrapped 423 cast steel wheels alone, plus other casting rejects, resulting in a total loss of 3.4 billion yuan. The phenomenon of forging rework and excessive machining allowance is also very common. The man-hours consumed by general forging rework are equivalent to one-half to two-thirds of the man-hours used to manufacture new forgings. This not only prolongs the manufacturing time and affects the timely completion of orders, but also inevitably increases the manufacturing cost and increases the investment in basic construction projects. Soviet experts have repeatedly suggested that we improve product quality, but this has not attracted the attention of various enterprises.

Since manufacturing equipment for key construction projects is the glorious responsibility of all staff and workers of heavy and mining machinery manufacturing plants, then we should do our best to do this work well. To this end, we need to start from three aspects: establishing the idea of serving key construction among all staff and workers; strengthening the leadership of production technical preparation work in the product manufacturing process; and strengthening production cooperation and promoting advanced experience.

Most of the orders for key construction projects have been arranged in the annual plan approved by the state. These order tasks, like all state plans, must be completed on schedule, which is beyond doubt. However, since our country has just begun to carry out planned construction, many tasks have no experience. Basic construction units often fail to deliver design drawings on schedule, or the planning work itself has shortcomings, and it is impossible to submit a complete and correct equipment order plan at one time. Many equipment orders are often put forward temporarily. These temporary order tasks are generally required to be more urgent, more difficult to manufacture, and the quantity is not large. Therefore, to truly serve key construction, we must bravely accept the tasks proposed by key construction projects; we must not only ensure the timely completion of so-called "planned" batch orders, but also ensure the timely completion of temporary and sporadic orders. At present, some enterprise leading cadres do not have enough understanding of this point. They do not consider the needs and difficulties of the ordering unit, and often only use whether it is convenient for the enterprise's production management as a condition for accepting orders. They would rather leave the equipment idle or manufacture those products that have already been backlogged, and refuse to accept temporary orders on the pretext of "urgent demand, miscellaneous specifications, and small quantity." After reluctantly accepting temporary orders, they also list them as "non-planned products" and do not pay attention to the production of these products ideologically. This idea of not considering the needs of the country is obviously very wrong. Of course, basic construction units should improve their work and try to plan temporary orders.

We must strengthen the leadership of production technical preparation work and strengthen the trial manufacture of new products. With the advancement of industrial construction and science and technology, many new products will be manufactured, and many old products will be gradually eliminated. When manufacturing new products, not only strict production organization is required, with dedicated personnel responsible for everything, but also engineering and technical personnel and workers are required to have a high technical level. Therefore, it is necessary to fully prepare the plan for the trial manufacture of new products and technical preparation work, and explain to the staff and workers participating in the trial manufacture of new products the political and economic significance of completing the trial manufacture task, and appropriately reward the staff and workers who have made achievements in order to encourage the staff and workers to overcome the difficulties of the trial manufacture. The products tested not only need to have a load performance and precision test after completion but also need to have a detailed record of the arrangement of process cards, the formulation of process regulations, the design of tools, the record and compilation of various technical quotas, and other series of works, in the process of the test manufacture, and be sorted according to practice, in order to ensure the quality of the test manufacture on the one hand, and to prepare for the formal production of those small batches or large batches of products on the other hand.

When each enterprise completes production tasks with many varieties and miscellaneous specifications, especially important temporary tasks, some technical problems and equipment imbalances will inevitably occur. Some of these problems need to be solved by applying to the state for the necessary technical measures fees. However, various enterprises must prevent this tendency: regardless of the size of the matter, they all use applying for huge technical measures fees as the only solution, believing that only the state's allocation of a large number of technical measures fees can guarantee the quality and quantity of products, and simply rely on state investment to add new equipment or even expand the factory buildings. This passive waiting idea is wrong. We should systematically and planfully lead employees to learn advanced experience, especially advanced Soviet experience, carry out labor competitions with technological innovation as an important content, and at the same time actively and proactively organize production collaboration between factories to overcome equipment imbalances and solve various manufacturing technology problems. This can not only save the state's technical measures fees but also further tap the potential of existing enterprises and strive to complete tasks faster by completing the orders for key construction projects.

    重型和矿山机械制造厂的光荣职责
    第一机械工业部第三机器工业管理局生产处副处长  吴征夫
    全国重型机械制造厂和矿山机械厂，担负着为重点工程制造大量设备，同时也为其他给这些工程服务的工厂、矿山制造设备的重大任务。在党的领导和苏联专家的帮助下，全国重型和矿山机械制造厂的职工在执行这个任务中，是有一定成绩的。最近一年来，曾经为有色金属工业和鞍山钢铁公司等单位制造了重六十吨的圆锥破碎机，重六十一吨的短筒球磨机，二百一十瓩的绞车，直径九百六十公厘的大轧辊，为橡胶厂制造了硫化罐，为矿山制造了六十吨翻车，为地质部门制造了一千公尺的钻探机。现在又给鞍山钢铁公司等重点建设工程制造着一百吨铁水车、一百二十吨钢锭模搬运车、十六点五立方公尺的渣罐车，以及直径五百公厘到一千五百公厘的各种闸阀。今年还要给发电厂制造每分钟五千五百三十转的汽轮减速机。这些都是比较大型和比较精密的成套设备或配件。这些机器设备的制造，不仅对保证重点工程的建设起了积极的作用，也不断地促进了我国机械工业制造技术的提高。
    在完成重点建设工程订货的任务中，有的企业的领导干部亲自布置任务，组织力量，领导职工分析产品的技术标准、性能要求，并以积极负责的精神主动地争取兄弟工厂的协作，解决了技术上和器材上的许多困难问题，因而不论在时间方面或质量方面，都完成了重点建设工程的订货任务。但是也有不少企业的领导干部，迄今还没有树立为重点建设工程服务的观点。有的企业强调专业化，只看到本单位的困难而没有看到国家进行基本建设的困难；有的则以索取工具、材料、木型，甚至提出降低质量推延交货时间等一系列要求，来为难订货单位。总之，不经过几番周折，讨价还价，他们是不肯接受订货的，尤其是那些零星的、临时的紧急订货任务。
    沈阳重型机器厂具有许多为其它各厂所没有的重型机器设备，因而有许多重点建设工程的设备订货不能不要求该厂来制造和配合。国家对该厂要求多而急，当然是不可避免的。但是，该厂个别领导干部并没有充分认识这一点，不是积极地把这个光荣任务担当起来，而是把国家对该厂的要求形容为对饭馆、商店的要求，把订货单位与该厂接洽订货说成“攻碉堡”。在这种错误的认识下，不久以前当上级领导机关要求该厂配合大连工矿车辆厂为鞍山钢铁公司锻造十六点五立方公尺渣罐车的车轴时，他们迟迟不作准备工作，并以其它借口来为难订货单位。大连起重机厂虽然接受了某部的油罐订货任务，但不同意订货单位在提货之前抽查产品质量。企业领导干部的上述思想是现在不能很好地完成基本建设工程订货任务的主要原因之一。
    产品质量不好也妨碍着支援重点建设。例如沈阳矿山机器厂制造的三十公尺和五十公尺的钻探机，因为结构设计错误，制造时质量又不好，又没做全套成品性能试验，结果用户一试车便发现毛病，直到现在还不能投入生产。产品质量低劣一般都集中在铸件、锻件和加工件方面。大连工矿车辆厂在今年一月制造六十吨翻车时，仅铸钢车轮就废了四百二十三个，再加上其他铸件废品，共损失三十四亿元。锻件返修和加工余量过大的现象也很普遍，一般锻件返修活所耗用的工时相当于制造新锻件所用工时的二分之一到三分之二。这不仅延长制造时间，影响及时完成订货任务，并且不可避免地增加制造成本，增加基本建设工程的投资。苏联专家不止一次建议我们改进产品质量，但始终没有引起各企业的重视。
    为重点建设工程制造设备既然是重型和矿山机械制造厂全体职工的光荣职责，那末就应该尽最大的努力来做好这个工作。为此需要从三个方面入手：在全体职工中树立为重点建设服务的思想；在产品制造过程中加强对生产技术准备工作的领导；加强生产协作和推广先进经验。
    大部分的重点建设工程订货已经被编排在经国家批准的年度计划里，这些订货任务像所有的国家计划一样，必须按期完成，是毫无疑义的。但是，由于我国刚刚开始进行有计划的建设，许多工作都没有经验，基本建设单位往往因某些设计图纸未能按期到达，或者因计划工作本身有缺点，不可能一次提出完全的正确的设备订货计划，不少的设备订货往往是临时提出来的。这些临时的订货任务，一般都要得比较急，制造也比较困难，要的数量又不多。因此，要真正为重点建设服务，就要勇敢地接受重点建设工程提出的任务；就要不仅保证按期完成所谓“计划内”的成批的订货任务，并且要保证按期完成临时的零星的订货任务。现在有些企业的领导干部对这一点没有足够的认识，不考虑订货单位的需要与困难，往往只以是否便于企业的生产管理作为接受订货的条件，宁愿让设备闲着或制造那些已经积压了的产品，对临时订货则借口“要得急、规格杂、数量少”，拒不接受。在不得已而接受了临时订货以后，也把它们列为“非计划产品”，从思想上就不重视这些产品的生产。这种不考虑国家需要的思想显然是十分错误的。当然，基本建设单位应该改进自己的工作，尽量做到临时订货计划化。
    必须加强对生产技术准备工作的领导，加强新产品试造。随着工业建设和科学技术的向前发展，将有许多新产品要制造，许多旧产品将逐步被淘汰。在制造新产品时，不仅要求生产组织严密，事事有专人负责，并且也要求工程技术人员和工人具有较高的技术水平。因此，必须要充分做好新产品试造的计划工作和技术准备工作，并要对参加新产品试造的职工说明完成试造任务的政治意义和经济意义，适当地奖励有成绩的职工，以便鼓舞职工克服试造的困难。对试造的产品不仅在完成后要进行负荷性能和精密度的检验，并且在试造过程中对过程卡片的编排、工艺规程的制定、工卡具的设计、各种技术定额的纪录和编制等一系列工作，都要做详细的记录和根据实践加以整理，以便一方面保证试造质量，另一方面又为那些小批的或大批的产品做好正式生产的准备工作。
    每一个企业在完成品种多、规格杂的生产任务，尤其是重要的临时任务时，不可免地要发生一些技术问题和设备不平衡的问题。其中有一些问题是需要向国家申请必要的技术措施费用来解决的。但是，各个企业必须防止这种偏向：无论大事小事都一律以申请巨额技术措施费用为唯一解决的办法，认为只有国家拨付大批技术措施费用才能保证产品的质量和数量，单纯依赖国家投资以增加新设备甚至于扩建厂房。这种消极等待的思想是不对的。我们应该有目标、有计划地领导职工学习先进经验，特别是学习苏联先进经验，开展以技术革新为重要内容的劳动竞赛，同时积极主动地组织工厂与工厂之间的生产协作，以克服设备不平衡及解决各种制造技术问题。这样不仅可以节约国家的技术措施费用，并且可以通过完成重点建设工程的订货任务进一步发掘现有企业的潜力，和争取较快地完成任务。
