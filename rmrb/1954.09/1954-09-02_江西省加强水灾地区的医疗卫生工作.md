Jiangxi Province is strengthening medical and health work in flood-stricken areas.

Since the beginning of the flood season, the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government and the Provincial Patriotic Health Campaign Committee have issued instructions requiring health authorities at all levels to strengthen medical and health work in flood-stricken areas. The Jiangxi Provincial Health Department has transferred 156 medical personnel from provincial hospitals, health and epidemic prevention agencies, and medical and health schools to work in flood-stricken areas. It has also allocated a large amount of funding, medical supplies, vaccines, equipment, and disinfectants to the flood-stricken areas, including more than 21,000 kilograms of bleaching powder and more than 22,000 kilograms of DDT powder and emulsion.

Health authorities in various flood-stricken areas have also transferred medical personnel, mobilized private practitioners, and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners from joint clinics, and organized a large number of mobile medical teams and groups to go deep into the disaster areas to carry out medical and health work. According to preliminary statistics, there are currently 82 mobile medical teams and groups in various flood-stricken areas, with more than 740 medical personnel participating in the medical teams, completing arduous treatment tasks. In Nanchang, Jinxian, and Xinjian counties alone, the number of treatments reached 60,318 person-times in one month. The Nanchang Red Cross Society's mobile medical groups treated 5,208 person-times and provided emergency treatment to more than 2,200 person-times in the flood-stricken areas of Nanchang's suburbs in one month.

In conjunction with the development of mobile medical work, various flood-stricken areas have actively strengthened prevention work. Jiujiang City put forward the slogan "Where the water recedes, clean up there," which encouraged the broad masses of people to actively clean up. To ensure the cleanliness of drinking water, the city organized a large number of drinking water disinfection boats to deliver disinfected drinking water to every household. More than 90% of the masses have enjoyed disinfected drinking water. At the same time, it also organized fecal transportation boats to transport feces on time according to streets. More than 70,000 people in various flood-stricken areas, counties, and cities in the Jiujiang Special Zone have completed cholera prevention injections.

Maternal and child health work is also being carried out in flood-stricken areas. Luo Guixiang, a model midwife in the Central South District, mobilized midwives in the flood-stricken areas of Nanchang County to organize a large number of temporary midwifery stations, went deep into the flood-stricken areas to visit pregnant women, and mobilized them to come to the stations for delivery. At present, more than 70 midwives in the county have organized temporary midwifery stations and are promoting this experience.

In the medical and health work in flood-stricken areas, medical personnel have shown a high degree of enthusiasm. In the Jiujiang, Nanchang, and Shangrao Special Zones, many traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, unafraid of hardship, actively participated in mobile medical teams. Staff participating in the mobile medical teams in Xinjian, Nanchang, Jinxian and other counties wrote letters of determination and actively challenged each other in their work in order to achieve greater results.

The strong support of health departments at all levels for health work in flood-stricken areas has greatly encouraged the people in the disaster areas to restore production and overcome disasters. (Zeng Xinmou)

    江西省加强水灾地区的医疗卫生工作
    江西省各级卫生机关，正积极地开展水灾地区的医疗卫生工作。
    自进入汛期以来，江西省人民政府、省爱国卫生运动委员会先后发布了指示，要求各级卫生机关加强水灾地区医疗卫生工作。江西省卫生厅抽调了省级各医院、卫生防疫机关、医药卫生学校医务人员一百五十六名到水灾地区进行工作，并拨出大批经费、应用药品、疫苗、器材和消毒用的药品，分配给各水灾地区，其中仅漂白粉就有二万一千余公斤，滴滴涕粉剂和乳剂二万二千余公斤。
    各水灾地区卫生机关同时也抽调了医务人员，动员了私营开业医生，以及联合诊所的中医，组织了大批的巡回医疗队、组，深入灾区进行医疗卫生工作。据初步统计，各水灾地区现有巡回医疗队、组共八十二个，参加医疗队的有七百四十多名医务人员，完成了繁重的治疗任务。仅南昌、进贤、新建三县在一个月内，治疗人数即达六万零三百一十八人次；南昌市红十字会各巡回医疗组，在南昌市郊水灾区，一个月内治疗人数达五千二百零八人次，急救二千二百余人次。
    结合巡回医疗工作的开展，各水灾地区更积极加强了预防工作。九江市提出了“水退到那里，打扫清洁到那里”的口号，鼓舞了广大的人民群众打扫清洁的积极性。为保证饮用水的清洁，该市组织了大批饮水消毒船，挨家挨户送消毒饮水，有百分之九十以上的群众已享受到消毒饮水；同时还组织了粪便清运船，按街按时清运粪便。九江专区各水灾区、县、市还有七万多人完成了霍乱预防注射。
    水灾地区的妇幼卫生工作也在开展，中南区模范接生员罗桂香，在南昌县水灾地区，发动接生员组织了大批的临时接生站，深入水灾地区访问孕妇，动员她们来站分娩。目前全县已有七十多名接生员组织了临时接生站，并正推广这一经验。
    在水灾地区的医疗卫生工作中，医务人员表现出高度的积极性。九江、南昌、上饶专区有许多中医不怕辛苦，踊跃地参加了巡回医疗队。参加新建、南昌、进贤等县巡回医疗队的工作人员，都写了决心书，并在工作中纷纷挑战应战，以便争取更大的成绩。
    各级卫生部门对水灾地区卫生工作的大力支援，大大鼓舞了灾区人民恢复生产、战胜灾害的情绪。（曾心谋）
