Refuting the Fallacies on the Taiwan Question
Li Chunqing

In recent weeks, certain foreign, particularly British, newspapers and magazines have been systematically spreading fallacies such as "Taiwan under UN trusteeship," "Taiwan neutralization," "Taiwan independence," and "two Chinas." Those who put forward the above fallacies cannot conceal that their fallacies actually only serve to encourage the US acts of aggression against China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

What does the so-called "Taiwan under UN trusteeship" mean? In reality, it is an attempt to deny that Taiwan is Chinese territory and hand Taiwan over to the United States for direct rule. Chapter XII of the United Nations Charter concerning the International Trusteeship System stipulates three types of territories that can be placed under trusteeship: (A) "Territories now held under mandate." (B) "Territories which may be detached from enemy states as a result of the Second World War." (C) "Territories voluntarily placed under the system by states responsible for their administration." The nature of the territory of Taiwan is neither A, nor B, nor C. Taiwan is the sacred territory of China. This fact has never been in doubt, and was affirmed by both the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation. How can there be any reason for trusteeship? If it is said that the Chinese territory of Taiwan can be placed under UN trusteeship, then isn't it also possible that Scotland or Wales in the United Kingdom can also be placed under UN trusteeship? Isn't this an absurd idea? If the British people cannot tolerate Scotland or Wales being handed over to UN trusteeship, what reason do some British commentators have to advocate handing over the Chinese territory of Taiwan to UN trusteeship? The United States has already used the flag of the United Nations to carry out a war of aggression in Korea. Now, the British "Taiwan trusteeship" advocates are offering advice to the United States, asking the United States to use the flag of the United Nations once again to invade China. This is very obvious.

Perhaps some people say that Japan ruled Taiwan for 51 years. Yes, but Japan's occupation of Taiwan for 51 years does not change the fact that Taiwan is Chinese territory. The Cairo Declaration stated: "Japan shall be stripped of all the islands in the Pacific which she has seized or occupied since the beginning of the first World War in 1914, and that all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese, such as Manchuria, Formosa, and the Pescadores, shall be restored to the Republic of China." After the Cairo Declaration was issued, on December 24, 1943, US President Roosevelt broadcast an explanation of the principles of the Cairo Declaration, saying: "These principles are both simple and basic. They include the return of stolen property to its rightful owner..." Listen! Taiwan is stolen property, and the rightful owner is China. Therefore, advocating Taiwan under UN trusteeship is tantamount to advocating that the United Nations forcibly occupy Chinese territory, which is of course completely unacceptable. Some people try to boost this unacceptable proposition and want to overturn the Cairo Declaration. For example, an article in the London "Times" on September 6 this year mentioned: "London has never regarded the Cairo Declaration as something binding in international law. It is merely a declaration of intent." The author of the article tries to lightly dismiss a solemn international declaration signed by the United Kingdom itself, which is a waste of effort. Who doesn't know that this international declaration is not just an "intent"? The Potsdam Proclamation urging Japan to surrender stated: "The terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be carried out"; and the Potsdam Proclamation is an international agreement with international legal binding force that both the victorious Allied countries and the defeated Japan must abide by. In fact, as a British Foreign Office spokesman said on August 25: "The Cairo Declaration said that Taiwan should be returned to the Chinese government - this has been done." "Intent" has become a fact, and Taiwan was returned to China on October 25, 1945. Now it is China's internal affair for the Chinese people to eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and liberate Taiwan. The United States is not allowed to interfere, nor is "trusteeship" permitted. This is a matter of course.

Obviously, the so-called UN trusteeship is actually US trusteeship, since the US controls the UN. Isn't the United States "trusteeshiping" Okinawa, "trusteeshiping" the Caroline Islands, the Marshall Islands, the Mariana Islands, "trusteeshiping" the Ogasawara Islands and Iwo Jima? Those who advocate Taiwan under UN trusteeship are advocating handing over Chinese territory to the United States. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. The Chinese people will never allow anyone to disregard this historical fact and make arbitrary decisions about Chinese territory in place of China!

Some people advocate the so-called "neutralization" of Taiwan. What does this mean? It can be understood by simply citing the remarks of some British newspapers that advocate the fallacy of "neutralization." For example, the editorial of the British "News Chronicle" on August 28 openly stated that their "neutralization" proposal is essentially US President Truman's "neutral policy" of invading and occupying Taiwan. Another proponent of "neutralization" - the British "Observer" also openly admitted on September 12 that "effective neutralization of Taiwan is most beneficial to the Allies' strategy in the Far East," and even demanded that the British government "firmly support" the continuation of the "status quo" in Taiwan to prevent the Chinese people from eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. Therefore, the essence of the fallacy of so-called "neutralization" is also an attempt to deny China's sovereignty over Taiwan, to place Taiwan under US control, and ultimately to allow the United States to smoothly annex Taiwan. Isn't this crystal clear?

There are also people talking about Taiwan "independence." What does this mean? An article published in the London "Times" on August 25 described the history of Taiwan and praised Chiang Kai-shek's "virtuous governance" in Taiwan, finally reaching this conclusion: "While the whole world is paying attention to the war of nerves between the hostile two Chinas (!), please do not forget that there are also about seven million Taiwanese." The British "Economist" magazine on August 21 even more bluntly advocated "recognizing Taiwan as an independent country." The "Observer" on August 22 also said: "Taiwan should belong to the people on that island." Obviously, it would be a big mistake to say that they know nothing about Taiwan. The historical facts are so clearly laid out: hundreds of years before the United Kingdom solved the problem of Irish territory, China had already established inspection departments in Taiwan to manage Taiwan and the Penghu Islands. In the Qing Dynasty, the Taiwan Prefecture was established, under the jurisdiction of Fujian Province, and later changed to a province directly under the central government. The historical facts are also so clearly laid out: more than 90% of the Taiwanese are Han Chinese, and the 200,000 or so Gaoshan people are one of China's ethnic minorities. The Taiwanese people are the Chinese people - the Taiwanese are as enthusiastically patriotic as the people on the Chinese mainland, and just as unwilling to be foreign slaves, demanding to live in the embrace of the motherland. In order not to be foreign slaves, the Taiwanese compatriots fought against Japan for more than 50 years, sacrificing more than 500,000 lives. The heroic struggle of the Taiwanese compatriots has continued to this day without stopping. The magnificent struggle of the Taiwanese compatriots against the evil rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in February 1947 shocked China and foreign countries. Even the US State Department's white paper "United States Relations with China" published in August 1949, Chapter VI, Section 11 "Taiwan" said: "Under the terms of the Cairo Declaration of December 1, 1943, the United States and China announced their intention that Taiwan should be returned to China." "The main hope of the island's people is to be reunited with their compatriots on the mainland." Therefore, the attempts of the "Taiwan independence" advocates to tamper with history and obliterate the strong will of the Taiwanese compatriots to return to the embrace of the motherland are absolutely untenable. They absolutely cannot take back the facts already acknowledged in the white paper. Is this so-called "Taiwan independence" fallacy worth even half a penny?

What does the so-called "two Chinas" mean? The British "Observer" on August 22 advocated that China and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique "must learn to coexist." The US "Christian Science Monitor" also suggested on August 21: recognize "two Chinas," the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in Taiwan and the People's Republic of China on the Chinese mainland, "each being an independent country in Asia." This has become an obviously non-accidental chorus of reactionary newspapers in Britain and the United States. There is no doubt that this fallacy is a necessary conclusion of the above-mentioned fallacies such as "neutralization." Therefore, it is clear at a glance on what absurd basis this argument is built. It is particularly surprising that this fallacy appears in countries like the United Kingdom that have expressed a willingness to coexist peacefully with the People's Republic of China and promote relations. They advocate the establishment of a so-called "independent country" in Taiwan. Do they also agree to turn Scotland in the United Kingdom into an independent country and coexist peacefully with that so-called "independent country"?

The reason why the above-mentioned fallacies should be refuted is that the advocates of these fallacies are doing their best to try to reverse right and wrong and confuse the public. They think this is for the sake of peace, but in fact, this kind of argument can only encourage the US aggressive group to invade and occupy our territory of Taiwan and intensify the criminal conspiracy of supporting the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to undermine peace in the Far East and the world. At present, public opinion in various countries around the world, including the just demands of the American people and many far-sighted people, is expressing unease and opposition to this kind of behavior of US imperialism that violates the interests of peace and security of all countries. Public opinion in various countries widely believes that the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan is China's internal affair and that the United States should not interfere. Therefore, the advocates of the above-mentioned fallacies are violating the conscience and will of the public in their own countries. These advocates believe that only by sacrificing the interests of the Chinese people to cater to the US aggressive policy can the serious consequences caused by the US aggressive policy be avoided. However, anyone who is unwilling to pretend to be blind can see that this encouragement to aggressors will not result in "appeasement," but will instead cause mankind to suffer even greater disasters.

The Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is unshakable. The above-mentioned fallacies cannot shake the Chinese people's determination to liberate their sacred territory in the slightest. The Chinese people firmly oppose all such fallacies. If these people truly desire peace and truly advocate peaceful coexistence, they should immediately withdraw these fallacies based on the principle of "do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself."

    驳斥关于台湾问题的谬论
    李纯青
    最近几个星期来，某些外国特别是英国的若干报纸杂志，有计划地在大量散布所谓“台湾交联合国托管”、“台湾中立化”、“台湾独立”、“两个‘中国’”等等谬论。发出上述谬论的人，不能掩饰他们的谬论实际上只能是对美国侵犯中国主权和领土完整的行为的一种鼓励。
    所谓“台湾交联合国托管”是什么意思呢？实际上就是企图否认台湾是中国的领土，将台湾交给美国来直接统治。联合国宪章第十二章国际托管制度规定有三种领土可以托管：（甲）“现在委任统治下的领土”。（乙）“因第二次世界大战结果或将自敌国割离的领土”。（丙）“负管理责任的国家自愿置于该制度下的领土”。台湾领土的性质，非甲，非乙，又非丙。台湾是中国神圣的领土，这个事实不但从来不发生疑问，而且为开罗宣言和波茨坦公告所肯定，岂有托管之理？如果说中国的领土台湾可以交联合国托管，那么，难道不是英国的苏格兰或威尔士也可以交联合国托管了么？难道这不是荒谬绝伦的意见么？如果英国人民不能容忍苏格兰或威尔士交给联合国托管，英国的某些评论家有什么理由主张把中国领土台湾交给联合国托管？美国已经利用了联合国的旗子在朝鲜进行了侵略战争。现在英国的“台湾托管”论者，是在向美国献策，要美国再一次利用联合国的旗子，来侵略中国。这是很明显的。
    也许有人说日本曾统治台湾五十一年。是的。但日本强占台湾五十一年，并不能改变台湾是中国的领土的事实。开罗宣言说：“日本所窃取于中国的领土，例如满洲台湾澎湖群岛等，归还中国”。在开罗宣言发表以后，一九四三年十二月二十四日美国总统罗斯福广播阐释开罗宣言的原则说：“这些原则既简单又基本。其中包括归还偷盗的财产给当然的主人。……”请听！台湾是被偷盗的财产，当然的主人是中国。因而主张台湾交联合国托管，无异于主张由联合国来强占中国的土地，这当然是完全不能容许的。有些人曲意想为这种不能容许的主张打气，又想推翻开罗宣言。例如今年九月六日伦敦“泰晤士报”一篇文章提到：“伦敦从未把开罗宣言当作在国际法上具有约束力的东西。它只不过是一个关于意图的宣言”。该文作者企图这样轻轻地把英国自己签了字的庄严的国际宣言一笔勾销，是枉费力气的。谁不知道，这个国际宣言，并不仅仅是
  “意图”，在促令日本投降的波茨坦公告里写着：“开罗宣言的条件必将实施”；而波茨坦公告是战胜的同盟国和战败的日本都必须遵守的具有国际法上的拘束力的国际协议。事实上，正如八月二十五日英国外交部一位发言人所说：“开罗宣言说，台湾应归还给中国政府——这一点已经做到了。”“意图”已经成了事实，台湾已于一九四五年十月二十五日归还中国了。现在中国人民要消灭蒋介石卖国集团，解放台湾，是中国的内政，不容美国干涉，也不许“托管”，这是天经地义的事。
    很显然，所谓联合国托管实际就是由控制着联合国的美国托管。美国不是在“托管”着琉球，
  “托管”着加罗林群岛、马绍尔群岛、马里亚纳群岛，“托管”着小笠原群岛和硫黄群岛吗？那些主张台湾交联合国托管的人，就是主张把中国的领土交给美国。这是中国人民绝对不能容忍的。中国人民绝不容许任何人漠视这一历史事实，代替中国来对中国的领土乱作主张！
    有些人主张所谓台湾“中立化”，这又是什么意思呢？只要举出英国鼓吹“中立化”谬论的若干报纸的言论来，就可以明白了。如英国“新闻纪事报”八月二十八日的社论，就公开表示他们的“中立化”主张，实质上就是美国杜鲁门总统宣布侵占我国台湾的“中立政策”。另一“中立化”的鼓吹者——英国“观察家报”九月十二日也公然承认“台湾有效地中立化对盟国在远东的战略最有利益”，并且竟要求英国政府“坚决支持”台湾“现状的继续”，以免中国人民消灭蒋介石卖国集团。因此，所谓“中立化”的谬论的实质，也就是企图否认中国对台湾的主权，就是把台湾置于美国的控制之下，而最后让美国顺利地并吞台湾。难道这不是清清楚楚的吗？
    还有人在讲什么台湾“独立”，这又是什么意思呢？伦敦“泰晤士报”八月二十五日刊载一篇文章，叙述了台湾的历史，歌颂蒋介石在台湾的“德政”，最后得出这样的结论：“正当全世界注意到敌对的两个中国（！）的神经战时，请不要忘记还有七百万左右的台湾人。”八月二十一日英国“经济学家”杂志更露骨地主张“承认台湾是一个独立国”。八月二十二日“观察家报”也说：“台湾应该属于那个岛上的人民。”很显然，如果说他们对于台湾真是一无所知，那就大错特错了。历史事实是这样明显地摆着，远在英国还没有解决爱尔兰领土问题的几百年前，中国就在台湾设了巡检司，管理台湾、澎湖。至清朝，更设台湾府，属福建省管，后改行省，直属中央。历史事实也这样明显地摆着，台湾人百分之九十以上都是汉族，二十万人左右的高山族是中国的少数民族之一。台湾人民是中国人民，——台湾人和中国大陆人民一样地热烈爱国，一样地不愿做外国的奴隶，要求生活在祖国的怀抱。为了不做外国的奴隶，台湾同胞曾与日本斗争了五十多年，牺牲五十万以上的生命，台湾同胞的英勇斗争，一直继续到现在没有停止过。一九四七年二月台湾同胞反对蒋介石卖国集团万恶统治的壮烈斗争，更是震动中外。这一点，连一九四九年八月美国国务院出版的“中美关系”的白皮书第六章第十一节
  “台湾”也说：“根据一九四三年十二月一日开罗宣言的条款，美国和中国宣布他们的意愿，即台湾应该归还中国。”“该岛人民的主要希望是和大陆的同胞再行团聚。”因此，“台湾独立”论者企图篡改历史，抹煞台湾同胞争取回到祖国怀抱的坚强意志，是绝对站不住脚的。他们绝对无法替美国收回白皮书中已经承认的事实。这样所谓“台湾独立”的谬论，还值半文钱吗？
    所谓“两个中国”又是什么意思呢？八月二十二日英国“观察家报”主张中国和蒋介石卖国集团“必须懂得共处”。美国“基督教科学箴言报”在八月二十一日也提出建议：承认“两个中国”，台湾的蒋介石卖国集团和在中国大陆的中华人民共和国，“每一个都是亚洲的独立国家”。这就变成了英美两国反动报纸绝非偶然的合唱了。毫无疑问，这个谬论是上述“中立化”等谬论的必然结论。因此，这个论调建立在怎样荒谬的基础上，是一目了然的。这种谬论出现在像英国那样表示愿与中华人民共和国和平共处，增进关系的国家里，是特别令人惊异的。他们主张在台湾成立所谓“独立国”，他们是否也同意把在英国的苏格兰变为独立国，并和那个所谓“独立国”和平共处？
    以上种种谬论之所以应该加以驳斥，是因为这些谬论的鼓吹者们竭力企图颠倒是非，混淆视听。他们自以为这样是为了和平，而实际上这种论调只能使美国侵略集团侵占我国领土台湾，加紧支持蒋介石卖国集团破坏远东和世界和平的罪恶阴谋受到鼓励。目前，世界各国公众舆论，包括美国的人民和许多有远见的人士的公正主张在内，都对美帝国主义这种违反各国和平与安全的利益的行为表示不安和反对。各国舆论广泛地认为中国人民解放台湾是中国的内政，美国不应干涉。因此，上述谬论的鼓吹者是违反他们国内公众的良知和意志的。这些鼓吹者们以为只有牺牲中国人民的利益来迎合美国的侵略政策，才能避免美国侵略政策造成的严重后果。但是，凡是不愿装作瞎子的人也能看到，这种对侵略者的鼓励，其结果将不是“息事宁人”，而是使人类可能遭到更大的灾祸。
    中国人民解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团的决心，是不可动摇的。上述谬论丝毫不能动摇中国人民解放自己神圣领土的决心。中国人民坚决反对一切这种谬论。如果这些人真正愿意和平，真正主张和平共处，他们应本着“己所不欲，勿施于人”的道理，立即收起这些谬论。
