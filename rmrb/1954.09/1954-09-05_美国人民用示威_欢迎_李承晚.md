    The U.S. People "Welcome" Syngman Rhee with Demonstrations
    Xin Ren
    Recently, Syngman Rhee returned to Seoul on August 13th after a twenty-day "visit" to the United States. In front of the South Korean people, Syngman Rhee tried his best to portray himself as a "triumphant" "hero," and immediately issued a statement saying: "The enthusiastic welcome and sympathy expressed by the American people everywhere was completely unexpected by me." His puppet government spokesman, Ge Hongji, also chimed in, saying that Syngman Rhee's biggest gain in the United States was "obtaining the support of the American public for the plan to unify Korea."
    How exactly did the American people "enthusiastically welcome" Syngman Rhee?
    As everyone knows, on July 28th, shortly after arriving in the United States, Syngman Rhee delivered a fiery speech in the U.S. Congress, clamoring to declare the Korean Armistice Agreement "null and void," to attack China, and even to provoke a world war. This mad war cry, apart from being called "full of American ideals" by American warmongers like Senator Wiley, aroused widespread anger among the American people. Therefore, when Syngman Rhee went to a banquet of the "U.S.-Korea Foundation" in New York on August 2nd, more than two hundred New York citizens who were "enthusiastically welcoming" him shouted slogans: Syngman Rhee is a "刽子手!" who wants to launch an atomic war! "Syngman Rhee is an unwelcome person, we demand peace!" "Syngman Rhee, go home!" This was truly "completely unexpected" by Syngman Rhee. At this time, he didn't act like a "hero" anymore, and he sneaked in through the back door of the Astoria Hotel where the banquet was held. On August 7th, when Syngman Rhee spoke to members of the "Federal Club" in San Francisco, he encountered a group of San Francisco people "enthusiastically welcoming" him outside the hotel, holding up flags with the words: "You want an atomic war. We want peace!"
    How exactly did the American public "support" Syngman Rhee's so-called "plan to unify Korea"?
    According to a United Press dispatch from New York on August 4th: "It's the same all across the United States. United Press conducted a survey of newspaper editorials and columns, and the results showed no sign of public support for the plan he advocated." United Press said that when Syngman Rhee delivered a speech at the "U.S.-Korea Foundation" banquet in New York, "his remarks about resuming the war did not elicit any applause." Moreover, before the end of the meeting, Syngman Rhee temporarily added a "loud appeal" for Americans to "take action," and "there was still no applause." United Press said: "Syngman Rhee was somewhat embarrassed at that meeting because there was no response to what he thought would elicit an extremely enthusiastic response."
    However, in order to cover up these "embarrassing" truths and deceive the South Korean people, Syngman Rhee's bandit gang, which flaunts "freedom of the press," implemented strict news censorship in South Korea. The scandal of news censorship in South Korea revealed by United Press is just one example. This happened on August 9th. According to United Press, Seoul newspapers received a radio facsimile from San Francisco, a photo of Syngman Rhee encountering demonstrators as he walked into a restaurant in San Francisco. In the background of the photo was a banner that read: "Ten thousand Americans have died, one hundred thousand Koreans have died. No more war, Mr. Rhee!" Some newspapers published this photo, but only after technicians carefully painted over the banner and rewrote the caption without mentioning the demonstrators. One newspaper even added the following caption to the photo showing demonstrators glaring at Syngman Rhee: "The picture shows President Syngman Rhee arriving at the Empress Hotel in San Francisco to attend a welcome party."
    The truth about the American people's "welcome" to Syngman Rhee is like this. (Attached picture)

    美国人民用示威“欢迎”李承晚
    辛人
    最近，李承晚在美国进行了二十天的“访问”之后，已经在八月十三日返回汉城。李承晚在南朝鲜人民面前，极力把自己装扮成一位“凯旋归来”的“英雄”，马上发表声明说：“各处美国人民群众所表示的热烈欢迎和同情是我根本没有预料到的。”他的伪政府发言人葛弘基也帮腔说：李承晚在美国之行中，最大的收获，就是
  “取得了美国公众对统一朝鲜计划的支持。”
    究竟美国人民怎样“热烈欢迎”李承晚的呢？
    大家知道，七月二十八日，李承晚刚到美国不久，就在美国国会中发表了一篇充满火药味的演说，叫嚣着要宣布朝鲜停战协定“寿终正寝”，要进攻中国，甚至要挑起世界大战。这种疯狂的战争叫嚣，除掉被美国好战分子，参议员维利之流称为“充满美国理想”之外，却激起了美国人民的普遍的愤怒。因此，当李承晚八月二日在纽约去赴“美韩基金会”的宴会时，两百多名“热烈欢迎”他的纽约市民高呼口号：李承晚是想发起原子战争的“刽子手！”“李承晚是不受欢迎的人，我们要求和平！”“李承晚滚回去！”这才真是李承晚“根本没有预料到的”。这时候，他却不充“英雄”了，他从举行宴会的亚斯多里亚大饭店的后门遛了进去。八月七日，李承晚在旧金山向“联邦俱乐部”的会员演说时，他在旅馆外面同样遇到一批“热烈欢迎”他的旧金山人民高举着旗帜示威，旗上写着：“你是要原子战争的。我们要和平！”
    究竟美国公众又是怎样“支持”李承晚的所谓“统一朝鲜计划”的呢？
    据合众社纽约八月四日电讯报道：“横贯美国到处都是一样。合众社对各个报纸的社论和专栏作了一次调查，结果表明并无公众支持他所鼓吹的计划的任何迹象。”合众社说，当李承晚在纽约“美韩基金会”的宴会上发表演说时，“他所发表的恢复战争的言论却完全没有引起掌声”。而且在会议结束前，李承晚临时又插进去“大声疾呼”美国人“行动起来”时，“还是没有掌声”。合众社说：“李承晚在那次会议上对于他以为会博得极其热烈响应的话竟没有反应，表示有些狼狈”。
    然而，为了掩盖这些“狼狈”的真相和欺骗南朝鲜人民，标榜“新闻自由”的李承晚匪帮在南朝鲜实行了严格的新闻封锁。合众社所透露的南朝鲜新闻封锁的丑闻不过是一个例子。这事是八月九日发生的。据合众社报道：汉城报纸收到了旧金山来的一张无线电传真照片，照片是李承晚在走进旧金山的一家饭店时碰到了游行示威的人。照片的背景中有一幅标语，上面写着：“一万美国人牺牲了，十万朝鲜人牺牲了。不要再进行战争了，李先生！”一些报纸刊出了这个照片，但是这些报纸仅仅是在技术人员细心地把标语涂去，并改写了说明而不提游行示威者之后刊出这个照片的。甚至一家报纸在这张显示游行示威的人对李承晚怒目而视的照片下面加上了这样的说明：“图示李承晚总统到达旧金山的皇后饭店参加一个欢迎会。”
    美国人民对李承晚“欢迎”的真相便是如此。（附图片）
