The Publication and Vocational Education Hall

From the central hall of the Soviet Exhibition Hall, heading east, one first sees the "Publication and Vocational Education Hall" in the west wing of the Culture Hall. The layout of this hall is very orderly. As soon as you enter this hall, it feels like entering a library with a rich collection of books. Various exquisite books are placed on velvet display stands in shades of golden yellow and crimson. On display here are publications from more than seventy major publishing houses in the Soviet Union, in Russian, as well as languages of other Soviet nationalities, and also in Chinese and other foreign languages, totaling about three thousand titles. In addition, there are various recently published magazines, newspapers, and propaganda posters.

Although only a small portion of Soviet publications are exhibited here, it fully demonstrates the vigorous development of the Soviet publishing industry.

One can see from a chart that the total number of books published in the Soviet Union in 1953 reached 962 million copies, 1.2 times more than in 1940.

The exhibited books are divided into four categories. The first category is political, economic, and social science books, the second is literature and art books, the third is technology and agricultural books, and the fourth is science and textbooks. Political, economic, and social science books occupy a very important part. On display here are the classic works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, which are the most widely circulated in the Soviet Union and have become essential reading for the Soviet people.

In terms of political books, there are also various speeches and reports by the leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government. There are also documents on the struggle of people of all countries for peace and books exposing American imperialist aggression.

Among the books on display is the Russian version of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," with exquisite binding. In addition, there are Russian versions of "The Complete Works of Lu Xun," Hu Qiaomu's "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China," Guo Moruo's "Qu Yuan," Ding Ling's "The Sun Shines over the Sanggan River," Zhou Libo's "The Hurricane," etc.

Charts show that the number of classical literary works published in the Soviet Union after the revolution greatly exceeds that before the revolution. Russian classical literary works have become beloved reading material for all nationalities in the Soviet Union. The works of great Russian writers such as Pushkin, Lermontov, Gogol, Leo Tolstoy, Chekhov, as well as contemporary great writers such as Gorky, have been translated into dozens of national languages ​​of the Soviet Union. Many Russian classical literary works are displayed on the display stands and in the glass cabinets of the exhibition hall. These exquisitely decorated literary works attract people.

Among the displayed literary works, there are many famous works of the Soviet era. The authors vividly portray the life of the Soviet people. Here are the poems of the great Soviet poet Mayakovsky, as well as the famous works of Ostrovsky and Fadeyev, who are loved by the Chinese people, and so on.

Here, people can also see foreign classical literary works published in the Soviet Union, such as selections from Shakespeare, a fifteen-volume set of Balzac, Heine's poems, and so on.

Children's literature books also occupy a considerably important position here.

Due to the continuous development of science, industry, and agriculture, scientific and technical books are being published in large quantities in the Soviet Union.

The works of many famous Soviet scientists and scholars are published in large quantities in various versions. The works of Timiryazev and Michurin have been published in many editions. Many academic and technical reference books are also constantly being published to meet the needs of the people. In the exhibition hall, people can also see the exquisite Soviet Encyclopedia, as well as various dictionaries published in Russian, languages of various Soviet nationalities, and foreign languages.

The publication of textbooks receives the attention of the Soviet Communist Party and the government. Here, people can see various textbooks used in Soviet universities, secondary schools, and primary schools.

In addition, at the eastern end of the book display hall, there are also many products and materials on display, showing the Soviet government's concern for popularizing education, training cadres, and developing science, art, and the work of cultural and educational workers. In addition to many explanations and pictures, models of machines such as combined coal mining machines made by students of technical schools and factory apprentice schools, as well as other creations, are displayed here. The pictures illustrate the teaching process of secondary specialized schools, technical schools, and factory apprentice schools, as well as the learning life of young workers and students.

Higher Education Hall

Passing through the hall of the "Publication and Vocational Education Hall" and heading east, you enter a square hall with a dome, which is the Higher Education Hall of the exhibition.

In the center of this hall is a model of the Moscow University building. When people see this white model, they cannot help but admire the grandeur of the Moscow University architecture.

The new campus and its various latest equipment provide excellent conditions for undergraduates, graduate students, scientific workers, professors, and teachers to conduct teaching.
