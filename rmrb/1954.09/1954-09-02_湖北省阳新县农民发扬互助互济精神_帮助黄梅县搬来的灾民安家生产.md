Farmers in Yangxin County, Hubei Province, Promote the Spirit of Mutual Aid to Help Disaster Victims from Huangmei County Settle Down and Produce

The broad masses of farmers in Yangxin County, Hubei Province, welcomed the disaster-stricken farmers who moved to the county with great enthusiasm, and promoted the spirit of mutual assistance to help the victims engage in production for self-relief.

During July and August this year, some farmers in Huangmei County, Hubei Province, who suffered from floods, were transferred to Yangxin County under the unified organization of local Party and government organs. After receiving this news, the farmers in Yangxin County made various preparations to welcome the disaster victims. Women enthusiastically boiled tea from morning till night to entertain them, so that the disaster victims could have hot water to drink everywhere they passed. When the victims crossed the river, the ferry boatmen provided free ferry service without collecting fares. The masses were even more considerate and caring in the disaster victims' residences. In order to solve the housing difficulties of the disaster victims, the local people voluntarily gave up their houses for the victims to live in, and helped them build thatched huts. In Baiyang Township, 309 peasant households used their own houses to settle 750 disaster-stricken households. The masses in the sixth district took the initiative to mobilize farmers with labor power, each helping to cut a load of thatch for the disaster victims to use for roofing. At the same time, the local people came up with various ways to help the disaster victims overcome their living difficulties after settling down.

The farmers in Shanquan Township proposed a guarantee: "Three households are responsible for one (disaster victim) household, ensuring that no one starves to death." Zhong Jinshui and Zhong Pingshui, farmers in Baiyang Township, learned that the disaster victims needed firewood, so they and the masses of the whole village voluntarily gave up the firewood on the mountain in front of the village for the disaster victims to cut, and they themselves went to the mountain half a kilometer away to cut firewood.

The local people also actively helped the disaster victims reclaim wasteland. The county has found more than 80,000 mu of wasteland for the disaster victims; and each township has allocated wasteland according to the place where the disaster victims live. Many farmers have lent production tools to the disaster victims to help them produce. In Taiping Township alone, 38 farmers lent 15 head of cattle and 54 pieces of farm implements such as plows and harrows. The Five-Star Agricultural Production Cooperative of Huangmei County reclaimed 12 mu of wasteland and planted 6 mu of corn in a timely manner seven days after moving to its new residence. The disaster victims living in the eighth district of Yangxin County have been organized to exchange labor and help each other.

Thanks to the enthusiastic help of the local people and the active support of the people's government in adopting measures such as allocating relief funds, ensuring the supply of materials, and organizing doctors to provide free medical treatment, the lives of the disaster victims who have moved to Yangxin County are now settled, and the disaster victims are actively carrying out a movement for production and self-relief.

    湖北省阳新县农民发扬互助互济精神
    帮助黄梅县搬来的灾民安家生产
    湖北省阳新县广大农民以高度热情欢迎搬到这个县的受灾农民，并发扬了互助互济精神，帮助灾民生产自救。
    今年七、八月间，湖北省黄梅县部分受水灾的农民在当地党政机关统一组织下，向阳新县转移。阳新县农民得到这一消息后，进行各种准备，欢迎灾民。妇女们热情地从早到晚烧茶招待，使过路灾民到处都有开水喝。灾民过河时，摆渡船的船工义务摆渡，不收渡费，灾民住地，群众对他们的欢迎和关怀更是无微不至，为了解决灾民住房困难，当地群众一面纷纷自动让出自己的房屋让灾民住，一面帮助灾民搭草屋。白杨乡中有三百零九户农民，就用自己的房屋安置了七百五十户灾民。六区群众自动串连发动有劳动力的农民，每人帮助割一担茅草，作为灾民盖屋用。同时，当地群众想出各种办法帮助灾民克服安居后在生活上的困难。
    山泉乡农民提出保证：“三户包一家（灾民），保证不饿死一个人”。白杨乡农民锺金水和锺平水了解灾民要求打柴，就和全壪群众自动让出本壪门口山上的柴让灾民打，自己跑到一里路外的山上去打柴。
    当地群众还积极帮助灾民开荒，全县已为灾民找到荒地八万多亩；各乡并根据灾民居住地方进行了荒地划配。很多农民纷纷借生产工具给灾民，帮助他们生产。仅太平乡三十八户农民，就借出耕牛十五头，犁、耙等农具五十四件。黄梅县五星农业生产合作社到新居后七天，就开荒十二亩，并及时种上了六亩玉米。居住在阳新县八区的灾民都已组织起来换工互助。
    由于当地人民的热情帮助和人民政府及时采取拨救济款、保证物资供应、组织医生免费治病等办法积极支援灾民，因而现在搬住阳新县的灾民生活都有着落，灾民们正积极开展生产自救运动。
