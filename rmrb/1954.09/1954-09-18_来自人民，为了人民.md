    From the People, For the People
    By our correspondent Tian Liu
    In the solemn Huai Ren Hall, the representatives of the National People's Congress are excitedly and happily arranging the happy life of the people of the whole country and seriously and earnestly planning the road for the motherland to move forward.
    The representatives are of different ages, genders, classes, nationalities, and occupations, and they come from all over the country, but they have the same feeling: everyone feels the lofty honor given to them by the people; everyone is determined to fulfill their solemn responsibility to the people.
    The more than 1,200 representatives were elected on a universal and equal basis, from the township to the county, from the county to the province, and from the province to the central government. The representatives come from the people and are for the people. Everyone feels infinitely honored to be elected as a representative to the National People's Congress, and at the same time feels equally solemn responsibility to the people. Jin Baishan, a representative of the Korean nationality from Heilongjiang Province, said seriously: "A poor peasant of a minority nationality who was oppressed and ravaged in the old society was elected as a representative to the National People's Congress, and I feel infinitely honored. What is more honorable than the trust of the people? I must be a good representative and manage state affairs completely in accordance with the opinions and interests of the people." Qu Yaoli, a national model agricultural worker, said: "Our honor is the highest, and our responsibility is also the highest. Although I personally come to the meeting, I represent all the voters in expressing opinions and making decisions."
      Li Yong, a nationally famous industrial labor model and driver of the Mao Zedong locomotive, expressed the common voice of the Chinese working class. He said that in the old days, workers were slaves bound by the iron chains of imperialism, feudalism, bureaucratic capitalism, and the bourgeoisie, but now they have become the leading class of the country and the masters of the country. "We must use our hands to build the country into an industrialized country, and we must use our brains to manage the country into a socialist country like the Soviet Union." He said: "In the second year of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I was elected as the Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Railway Trade Union by the worker comrades, and now I have been elected as a representative to the National People's Congress. This honor was unimaginable in the old society!" After Li Yong left his group to specialize in trade union work, his crew only had a group of young workers left. But the young workers did not disgrace the honor of the "Li Yong Crew" and have already created an excellent record of 600,000 kilometers of safe driving. When they heard that their old group leader was elected as a representative to the National People's Congress, the young men jumped up with joy. They proposed to create a new record of 800,000 to 1 million kilometers of safe driving to celebrate the opening of the National People's Congress.
    On the night of September 15, 1954, Li Shunda could not sleep for a long time, thinking about the events of that afternoon over and over again. When he was still a teenager, he fled to the Taihang Mountains in Shanxi Province as a refugee because of the famine in his hometown. This poor peasant, who spent his days circling the mountainside, seeing only stones and not people, and had not walked out of the mountain沟 for more than ten years; this farmer, who could only enter the township office to pay taxes, pay donations, and respond to errands, today, after turning over, sat side by side with Chairman Mao on the rostrum at the first meeting of the National People's Congress, presiding over the meeting, and listening to the report on the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China by Comrade Liu Shaoqi, a member of the Constitution Drafting Committee. Until late at night, when the trams had stopped running, Li Shunda was still repeatedly thinking about what Chairman Mao said when he announced the opening of the meeting, and was still thinking about Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report, and the warm and firm voices were still ringing in his ears: "Socialism...", "Industrialization...", "Led by the working class..." He also repeatedly and enthusiastically said: "We are moving forward", "Our goal must be achieved!"
      Shen Jilan, a nationally famous female labor model and the well-known Vice-Chairman of the Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative, was elected as a representative to the National People's Congress along with Li Shunda. She used a very simple sentence to profoundly express the status of women in society and family in the old days: "In the past, women did not even get to manage small family matters, let alone national affairs." In the old society, women spent their days revolving around the "three platforms": after finishing sewing on the "kang platform," they had to push the millstone and grind on the "mill platform," and then they had to go to the "stove platform" to light the fire and cook. Not going out of the gate, not stepping out of the second door, dying in front of the pot, and being buried in front of the stove, was the fate of the vast number of women in the old society. Shen Jilan said: "It was not until the Communist Party and Chairman Mao came that we women were liberated." Shen Jilan excitedly recounted her experiences and life after liberation. He said that after the Communist Party came, women were liberated along with men; in the land reform, they were also given land like men; the state also formulated laws on equality between men and women to protect women's rights. However, because the countryside was still a "small peasant economy" of each family, it was difficult for women to get rid of family chores, and they still had to live as before: men were in charge of outside affairs, women were in charge of internal affairs; men farmed the land, women cooked the meals. Men still made the decisions on everything in life. Men still regarded women as housekeepers who washed clothes, cooked, and took care of children. It was not until the organization of mutual aid teams, especially after the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives, that the status of women underwent a fundamental change. In the cooperative, agriculture and sideline industries were combined, and agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry were developed together. With more people, the division of labor became more detailed; with more things to do, the possibility of women participating in production increased, especially in the cooperative, where labor was the main form of distribution, women also earned work points like men and received remuneration. Men's thinking that "I support the whole family and support women" slowly changed, and they slowly realized that the happy life of the family was built together with women. The status of women in the family has fundamentally changed. Shen Jilan said happily: "We women fully support the provisions in the Constitution regarding women's rights and the protection of mothers and children, but we support the entire Constitution even more. The Constitution is a guarantee for building our country into a socialist society. Only socialism can give us women true liberation and true equality." Shen Jilan excitedly recounted the great enthusiasm of the broad masses of women in participating in agricultural production cooperatives and striving for socialism. When their village's cooperative was first established in 1951, it only had twenty-six households. This year, out of the 276 households in the whole township, 203 households have already joined the agricultural production cooperative. She said: "It is the enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants to strive for socialism, and it is also the enthusiasm of the broad masses of rural women to strive for socialism, that has enabled the agricultural production cooperative to develop so quickly. Last year, the work points made by the women in our cooperative accounted for more than 34% of the total work points of the cooperative, and this year it is even higher than last year."
    Even before they were elected, the representatives had already begun to carefully study and seriously discuss the draft Constitution again and again since June of this year. And now—when all the representatives gathered in Beijing for the first meeting, they still discussed and studied the draft Constitution word by word, sentence by sentence, starting from the first word. In particular, the worker and peasant labor model representatives discussed it even more seriously. Ma Liuhaizi, a coal mining digger from Datong Coal Mine, said: "This is a major law that determines the happiness of our people and the prosperity of our country, and it is a major law for building socialism. We cannot be careless at all." The representatives from worker and peasant backgrounds did not speak much at the meeting, nor did they speak for long, but they were so firm, confident, excited, and enthusiastic. Every word and every opinion of theirs was like a steel nail, deeply embedded in the wooden board, immovable and unpullable.
    Among the representatives to the National People's Congress from Shanxi Province, there was a fat representative with a radiant face. When holding group meetings, he always gazed at the speakers with a thoughtful look, listening attentively, and rarely expressed his opinions easily. But when deciding on each issue, he definitely expressed his attitude: to approve or to oppose. During the breaks in the meeting, he carefully sorted out the documents of the meeting. Even a temporary notice was neatly placed in his file bag and kept. People who did not know him could easily mistake him for a scientist, scholar, or professor from his focused expression and steady attitude. He was an ordinary farmer, a hired hand named Wu Chun'an who had worked as a long-term worker for landlords for twenty-two years. "I didn't go to school early," he explained, "I have to rely on listening carefully to bring back the spirit of the meeting—afraid that I won't remember everything, I keep all the documents issued by the meeting, so that people who can read can help me convey them when I go back." What a simple and sincere attitude! A representative who fully understands the solemn responsibility he has to the people. Although his low level of education has brought many difficulties to his work, he still wholeheartedly undertakes the important task entrusted to him by the people. He said earnestly: "Although I am not very literate, I know the opinions and demands of our peasants. I will approve of anything that is in line with the interests of the people, and I will oppose anything that is not." Then he added: "The peasants' demands are to develop mutual aid teams and cooperatives, take the road of collectivization, improve production and improve life, support the country's industrial construction, and build our country into a strong socialist country as soon as possible."
    "Build our country into a strong socialist country as soon as possible"—this is not only the opinion of Representative Wu Chun'an, it is the common will of more than 1,200 representatives, and it perfectly expresses the will, determination, and strength of the broad working class and hundreds of millions of peasants. This determination and strength declares to the world: "Our goal must be achieved. Our goal can certainly be achieved."

    来自人民，为了人民
    本报记者　田流
    庄严的怀仁堂里，全国人民代表大会的代表们，在兴奋愉快地安排着全国人民的幸福生活，严肃认真地规划着祖国前进的道路。
    代表们年龄不同、性别不同、阶级不同、民族不同、职业不同，而且来自各地，但却有一种同样的情感：每一个人都感到人民给予自己的崇高的荣誉；每一个人都决心实现对人民的庄严的责任。
    一千二百多位代表，都是在普遍、平等的基础上，从乡到县、从县到省，又从省到中央地选举出来的。代表们来自人民，也为了人民。每个人对自己当选为全国人民代表大会代表，都感到无限光荣，同时也感到对人民负有同样庄严的责任。黑龙江省朝鲜族金白山代表严肃地说：“一个在旧社会里被压迫、被蹂躏的少数民族的贫苦农民，当选为全国人民代表大会代表，我感到无限光荣。有什么比人民的信任更光荣的呢？我一定要作个好代表，完全按照人民的意见、人民的利益管理国家大事。”全国农业劳动模范曲耀离代表说：“我们的光荣是最高的，责任也是最高的。虽说是我个人来开会，我是代表全体选民发表意见、决定事情的。”
      全国著名的工业劳动模范、毛泽东号机车司机长李永的话，表达了中国工人阶级的共同的声音，他说，在旧时代，工人是被帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资产阶级和资产阶级条条铁链捆绑着的奴隶，现在变成国家的领导阶级，变成国家的主人了。“我们就要用我们的双手把国家建设成工业化的国家，就要用我们的脑筋把国家管理成像苏联那样的社会主义国家。”他说：“中华人民共和国成立的第二年，我被工人同志们选为中国铁路工会全国委员会副主席，现在又被选为全国人民代表大会代表，这光荣在旧社会里想也不敢想啊！”李永离开他的小组专作工会工作后，他的包乘组就只剩下一群年青的工人。但青年工人们并没有辱没了“李永包乘组”的荣誉，已经创造了安全行车六十万公里的优越成绩。当听到自己的老组长当选为全国人民代表大会代表时，青年小伙子们高兴得跳起来，他们提出要创造安全行车八十万到一百万公里新纪录，来庆贺全国人民代表大会会议的召开。
    一九五四年九月十五日的夜晚，李顺达很久很久也睡不着，一次又一次地想着当天下午的事。当他还是一个十几岁的孩子的时候，因家乡闹灾荒，就逃到山西太行山中当难民。这个成天围着山坡转、只见石头不见人、十几年没有走出过山沟的贫苦农民；这个只有缴税、纳捐、应差才能走进乡公所大门的庄稼汉在翻身以后的今天，在全国人民代表大会第一天的会议上，同毛主席肩并肩地坐在主席台上，主持着会议，听取宪法起草委员会委员刘少奇同志关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告。直到深夜，电车已经停驶了，李顺达还在反复的想着毛主席在宣布开会时说的话，还在想着刘少奇同志的报告，耳边还响着那热烈的、坚定的声音：“社会主义……”、“工业化……”、“工人阶级领导的……”他还反复地、热情地说着：“我们正在前进”，“我们的目的一定能够达到！”
      全国著名的妇女劳动模范、有名的李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社副社长申纪兰，同李顺达一起当选为全国人民代表大会代表。她用一句极简单的话，深刻地道出了旧时代的妇女在社会和家庭中的地位：“过去，妇女们不用说管理国家大事，连家庭小事也挨不着管。”旧社会妇女就是成天围着“三台”转：刚在“炕台”上作完针线，就得去推碾捣磨上“碾台”，随后又该去“灶台”烧火作饭了。大门不出，二门不迈，死在锅前，埋在灶前，就是旧社会的广大妇女的命运。申纪兰说：“直到共产党、毛主席来了以后，我们妇女才得到解放。”申纪兰兴奋地叙述了她解放后的经历和生活。他说，共产党来后，妇女和男人们一起解放了；土地改革中也和男人一样分得了土地；国家还订出了男女平等的法律，来保护妇女权利。可是，因为当时农村里仍是
  一家一户的“小农民”，妇女们很难摆脱家庭琐事，只得还照老样子过活：男人主外，女人主内；男人种田，女人烧饭。生活里的大小事，还是男人作主。男人眼目中还是把女人看成洗衣、作饭、带孩子的看家婆。组织起互助组，特别是成立起农业生产合作社以后，妇女的地位才发生了根本的变化。合作社里农副业结合，农、林、牧业一齐发展，人多了，分工细了；事多了，妇女参加生产的可能性增大了，尤其是合作社里以劳力分红为主，妇女们也像男人们一样挣得了劳动日，获得了报酬。男人们那种“是我养活全家、养活女人”的思想才慢慢地改变了，慢慢地认识到家庭的幸福生活是同女人共同建设起来的。妇女们在家庭中的地位才从根本上发生了变化。申纪兰快乐地说：“我们妇女完全拥护宪法中关于妇女权利、保护母亲儿童的规定，可是我们更拥护整个的宪法。宪法是使我国建成社会主义社会的保证。只有社会主义、才能使我们妇女得到真正的解放、真正的平等。”申纪兰兴奋地叙述了广大妇女参加农业生产合作社，奔社会主义的高度热情。她们村的合作社一九五一年刚成立时只有二十六户，今年，全乡二百七十六户人家，已经有二百零三户参加农业生产合作社了。她说：“这是广大农民奔社会主义的热情，也是广大农村妇女奔社会主义的热情，才使农业生产合作社有了这样快的发展。去年我们社的妇女作的劳动日，占全社总劳动日的百分之三十四以上，今年比去年还要高。”
    代表们还在他们当选以前，早在今年六月间，就开始一次又一次地仔细学习、认真讨论过宪法草案了。而现在——全体代表齐集北京，举行首次会议时，仍然从宪法草案的第一个字开始，逐条逐句的讨论研究。特别是工、农业劳动模范代表们，讨论得更是认真。大同煤矿的掘进工人马六孩代表说：“这是决定咱人民幸福、国家兴盛的大法，是建设社会主义的大法，可不敢一点马虎。”工人、农民出身的代表们，在会上说话不多，更不长，但却那样坚定自信、兴奋而热情。他们的每一句话，每
  一个意见，都像一颗钢钉，深深地钉入木板里，摇不动，拔不掉。
    山西省的全国人民代表大会的代表中，有一位胖胖的满面放着光彩的代表。开小组会的时候，他总是用沉思的目光，凝视着发言的代表，全神贯注的倾听着，轻易不发表意见。但每一个问题决定的时候，他都肯定的表示自己的态度：赞成或是反对。在会议休息的时候，他仔细地整理着大会文件，哪怕是一个临时性的通知，都把它齐齐整整地放入自己的文件袋，保存起来。不认识他的人，从那全神贯注的神情上，从那稳重沉着的态度上，很容易把他当作科学家、学者或教授。他是一个普通的农民，一个给地主扛了二十二年长工的雇农吴春安代表。“早先没上过学，”他表白说：“我就凭用心听才能把大会精神带回去啊——怕记不全，我把大会发的文件都保存着，回去后好让识字的人帮我传达。”多么质朴真诚的态度！一个充分了解对人民负有庄严的责任的代表，文化程度低虽然给他的工作带来了很多困难，但是他还是全心全意地担负起人民对他的重大付托。他认真地说：“我虽不大识字，可是我知道咱农民的意见和要求。合人民利益的我就赞成，不合的我就反对。”随后他补充说：“农民的要求就是发展互助组、合作社，走合作化的道路，提高生产改善生活，支援国家工业建设，把咱们国家早日建成社会主义的强国。”
    “把咱们国家早日建成社会主义的强国”——这不只是吴春安代表的意见，这是一千二百多位代表的共同意志，它完善地表达了广大工人阶级、亿万农民的意志、决心和力量。这决心和力量向全世界宣告：“我们的目的一定要达到。我们的目的一定能够达到。”
