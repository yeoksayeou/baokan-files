Short Commentary:

    In recent years, the electrical industry system has repaired and utilized some old equipment. Coupled with the construction and expansion of some new power plants, it has basically guaranteed the electricity needs of national industrial production and basic construction. As the country's large-scale economic construction begins, the need for industrial and civil electricity is increasing day by day. However, according to the country's existing conditions, it is currently impossible to build more new power plants. We must also repair and utilize all possible old equipment in order to better meet the needs.
    The capacity of old equipment repaired by the electrical industry system last year and this year accounted for more than 30% of the total newly added power generation capacity for the year, and most of it directly serves the urgent electricity needs of the 141 major projects or other important factories and mines. According to estimates by the electrical industry system, the number of old equipment that can be repaired and utilized in the next few years is still quite large. Therefore, the General Administration of the Electrical Industry of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry recently further strengthened its leadership over this work and formulated some specific measures, which is very necessary.
    However, not all cadres in the electrical industry clearly understand the importance of actively repairing and utilizing old electrical equipment. Some cadres, disregarding the country's current conditions, blindly demand the construction of more new power plants; some cadres mistakenly regard the repair of old equipment as a work with no future, with many difficulties and small results, and therefore a "thankless" job; some cadres turn a blind eye to the idle state of old equipment, mistakenly believing that the remaining old equipment is all broken and useless; some units, due to departmentalism, would rather let their own old equipment sit idle than allow the state to dismantle it for repair and utilization. Particularly serious is that some units, due to poor management, have damaged equipment that could have been repaired and utilized, causing undue losses to the state's valuable assets. Some comrades are not active or serious in the appraisal and overhaul of old equipment, often failing to meet the requirements of the project. In the design departments, due to the lack of specialized organizations or personnel, they cannot well undertake the design tasks of old equipment repair projects. In addition, the lack of coordination and cooperation among the construction, design, and construction departments has also greatly affected the repair of old equipment.
    Leading cadres at all levels of the electrical industry must fully recognize the great significance of repairing and utilizing old equipment for meeting the country's electricity needs and saving national construction funds, and must be determined to do this work well. The electrical industry's basic construction system needs to establish appropriate organizations to specifically oversee this work, investigate old equipment scattered in various places, organize relevant departments to do a good job in appraisal, and study and formulate repair plans. The electrical industry design departments should also set up corresponding organizations or personnel to be responsible for the design of old equipment repair projects and the design of some accessories, and to establish close coordination and cooperation with the machinery manufacturing departments, so as to repair some incomplete equipment and manufacture new accessories according to the repair plan, ensure the completion of the repair plan on schedule, so as to fully utilize these old equipment to serve the national construction.

### 积极修复和利用电业的旧设备

    积极修复和利用电业的旧设备
　　几年来，电业系统修复和利用了一些旧设备，加上新建和扩建一些新的电厂，基本上保证了国家工业生产和基本建设对电力的需要。国家大规模的经济建设开始以后，工业及民用电力的需要日益增加，但根据国家现有条件，目前不可能建设更多的新电厂，还必须把一切可能利用的旧设备加以修复利用，才能更好地满足需要。
    电业系统去年和今年修复的旧设备容量，均占全年新增发电容量的百分之三十以上，而且其中大部分是直接为一百四十一项巨大工程或其他重要厂矿生产紧急用电服务的。根据电业系统的估算，今后数年内可能修复利用的旧设备，其数量还相当大。因此，最近中央燃料工业部电业管理总局进一步加强了对这一工作的领导，并制定了一些具体措施，这是十分必要的。
    但是，对于积极修复和利用电业的旧设备的重要意义，并不是电业的所有干部都认识清楚了的。有些干部不顾目前国家现有条件，盲目要求建设更多的新电厂；有的干部把旧设备的修复工作错误地认为是一种无前途的，困难多，成果小，因而是“出力不讨好”的工作；有的干部对于旧设备的闲置情况熟视无睹，错误地认为剩下的旧设备都是破烂无用的东西；有的单位由于本位主义作怪，他们宁可让自己的旧设备闲着，却不让国家拆迁去修复利用。特别严重的是、有些单位由于保管不善，使本来可以修复利用的设备受到损坏，使国家宝贵资产受到不应有的损失。有些同志在对旧设备进行鉴定和检修工作时不积极不认真，往往赶不上工程的要求。在设计部门，则由于缺乏专业的组织机构或人员，不能很好地担负起旧设备修复工程的设计任务来，加以建设、设计、施工各个有关部门配合协作不够，也使旧设备的修复工作，受到了相当大的影响。
    各级电业领导干部必须充分认识修复和利用旧设备对于满足国家电力需要和节约国家建设资金的重大意义，务必下定决心作好这件工作。电业基本建设系统，需要建立起适当的组织机构，专门掌握这一工作，调查散置各地的旧设备，组织有关部门作好鉴定工作，研究和制定修复计划。电业设计部门也应设置相应的组织或人员，负责旧设备修复工程的设计和一些配件的制造设计工作，并和机械制造部门取得密切配合和协作，以便按照修复计划进行某些残缺设备和新制配件的修理和制造工作，保证按期完成修复计划，以便充分利用这些旧设备来为国家建设服务。
