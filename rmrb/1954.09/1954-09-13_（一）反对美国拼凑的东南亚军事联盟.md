    The eight-nation conference in Manila, planned by the United States, has signed the so-called "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" and other documents, based on the aggression plan prepared by Washington for the conference. This is the product of the United States exerting pressure on its followers in an extremely unpopular situation. Despite the participating countries' attempts to defend and cover up, the outcome of the conference clearly shows that the United States is leading some countries down a dangerous path.

    The aim of the US aggressor group is to organize a war bloc that divides Asia, opposes the People's Republic of China, undermines the Geneva Accords on restoring peace in Indochina, suppresses the forces in the East striving for peace, freedom, and national independence, and curbs the trend of countries demanding peaceful coexistence and the establishment of collective peace, in order to promote the US war policy and aggression policy of dominating Asia. To achieve this goal, the US ruling group, disregarding the opposition of the Asian people and major Southeast Asian countries, is trying to create division and hostility, continue to create international tension, and attempt to turn Asia into a breeding ground for new wars. The group established under the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" is mainly a war bloc of colonial countries attempting to control Southeast Asian countries.

    The so-called "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty," signed in Manila according to the US-made draft, is an aggressive military alliance. Although the treaty uses phrases such as "living in peace with all peoples and all governments" and "ensuring" the "peaceful settlement of any international disputes in which they may be involved" in its preamble and provisions, this cannot conceal the treaty's threat to peace and security in Southeast Asia and Asia. Articles 2 and 4 of the treaty clearly stipulate the military and war obligations undertaken by the contracting states. According to these provisions, the contracting states must not only "separately and jointly, by means of continuous and effective self-help and mutual aid, maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity," and not only "deal with" any "armed attack" on any contracting state, but also "immediately consult" on anything that any contracting state considers to be a "threat in any manner other than armed attack" and "the impact and threat of any fact or situation that may endanger the peace of the region" and "measures that should be taken." The treaty also stipulates that the military and war obligations assumed by the contracting states apply to "any state or territory that the contracting states may hereafter designate by unanimous agreement." It is clear that this treaty not only keeps the contracting states in a constant state of preparedness for war, but also allows the US aggressor group to create any excuse to launch wars or carry out aggression, and may drag all the contracting states into the flames of war. Therefore, this treaty is completely contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. The Southeast Asian military alliance organized under this treaty is fundamentally incompatible with the regional organizations stipulated in the United Nations Charter.

    The member states of the Southeast Asian military alliance are mainly not Asian countries. The major Southeast Asian countries of India, Indonesia, Burma, and Ceylon have all refused to participate in the Manila conference convened by the United States. The United States, in violation of the wishes of Asian countries, especially Southeast Asian countries, forcibly established a military alliance in the Southeast Asian region and made many countries undertake extremely broad and dangerous military obligations. Obviously, it wants to use this alliance as a tool for dividing Asia and carrying out aggressive wars. The Associated Press reporter from Manila believed in a dispatch: "The Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" will be "a big stick" that the United States can use, and "give the US president... greater freedom of action in this region."

    The main target of this military alliance pieced together by the United States is China. The treaty draft formulated by the United States openly wrote out this intention, saying that it would take "communism" as the hostile target of the Southeast Asian military alliance. Although, due to the claims of some countries, the words "communism" were removed from the text of the treaty signed in Manila, the so-called "understanding" of the United States attached to the treaty still shows that the hostile target recognized by the United States "only applies to" the non-existent so-called "communist aggression." The other countries participating in the conference actually agreed to this understanding. Since these countries have tied themselves to the US chariot, it is difficult for them to escape the dangerous situation arranged for them by the US adventurous policy.

    The "promoting economic progress and social welfare" clause in the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" cannot deceive anyone. The US propaganda machine has never concealed that this is a bait for the United States to lure more Asian countries to serve the US aggression policy; at the same time, it is also a means for US monopoly capital to further expand its market, enslave the Asian people, and squeeze out the traditional forces of Britain and France.

    In addition to signing the so-called "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty," the Manila Conference also signed a protocol. This protocol openly designates Cambodia, Laos, and the so-called "Free Vietnam" as the countries and territories to which the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" will apply. This means that the countries of the Southeast Asian military alliance have included these three French Federation member states in Indochina within the scope of their military alliance and forced them to undertake military obligations. Obviously, this is a public violation of the Geneva Accords on restoring peace in Indochina. The Geneva Accords clearly stipulated that the three Indochinese countries should not participate in any military alliance. The Southeast Asian military alliance countries unilaterally declared that they would assume military obligations to the three Indochinese countries, and obviously attempted to undermine the Geneva Accords on restoring peace in Indochina and continue to maintain the tense situation in Indochina in order to re-ignite the war in Indochina. The countries of the Southeast Asian military alliance adopted the method of unilaterally declaring that they would assume military obligations to the three countries and actually included the three countries within the scope of the treaty area. This cannot but arouse serious vigilance among the people of Asia and the world who love peace. The major countries of the Manila Conference have undertaken obligations to the solemn agreement of the Geneva Conference, and they cannot escape the responsibility for the serious consequences caused by their signing of this protocol in Indochina.

    The countries of the Manila Conference signed a so-called "Pacific Charter," proclaiming that they would take "maintaining the principle of equal rights and self-determination of all peoples" and even "the independence of all countries" as the "solid foundation for common action" of this military alliance of colonial countries in reality. This kind of provision cannot weaken the aggressive role of the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty." The manipulators of the Southeast Asian military alliance can create any excuse at any time to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, suppress national liberation movements, and even all actions that oppose the oppression of the colonialists and defend independent sovereignty will be severely interfered with. Recently, the US aggression crime of subverting the democratic and independent government of Guatemala is a very vivid example. Therefore, it is very clear that the so-called "independence and sovereignty of all countries" in this hypocritical document can only be a guise for the United States to conquer and enslave Asian countries. It is by no means accidental that all Asian countries that respect their own freedom and independence refuse to participate in the Southeast Asian military alliance.

    Facts fully prove that the Southeast Asian military alliance is a tool for the United States to pursue its "policy of strength" and a threat to the peace and security of Asian countries. Therefore, the holding of the Manila Conference and the signing of the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" immediately aroused widespread opposition and condemnation. Indian Prime Minister Nehru pointed out that this treaty is very unfortunate because it endangers peace instead of guaranteeing it. He also believes that the colonial countries and their supporters are powerless to stop the powerful anti-colonial forces in Asia. This is undoubtedly true. The fact that the vast majority of Asian countries oppose the military alliance of colonial countries pieced together by the United States will powerfully prove that the force of striving for collective peace is irresistible. The US aggressor group will never have the power to reverse the situation in Asia, and its new adventurous plan is destined to suffer even more disastrous failures.

    The government and people of the People's Republic of China have repeatedly declared their willingness to coexist peacefully with any country in the world on the basis of equality and mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, and have made great efforts to establish collective peace in Asia and the world. The military alliance established by the US aggressor group and its followers in the Southeast Asian region seriously threatens the peace and security of Asian countries and creates a new tense situation in Asia. The Chinese people resolutely oppose the aggressive policy of the US aggressor group that is hostile to China and the people of Asian countries, and are willing to work together with the people of Asia and the peace-loving people of the world to defeat the US aggression policy and strive unremittingly for the establishment of collective peace in Asia and the world.

### （一）反对美国拼凑的东南亚军事联盟

    （一）反对美国拼凑的东南亚军事联盟
    美国策划在马尼拉举行的八国会议，已根据华盛顿当局为会议所准备的侵略计划，签订了所谓“东南亚集体防务条约”和其他文件。这是美国在极不得人心的局势下对它的追随者横施压力的产物。尽管与会国家力图辩解和掩饰，但会议的结果依然清清楚楚地表明，美国正在把一些国家导向一条危险的道路。
    美国侵略集团的目的是要组织分裂亚洲的战争集团，敌视中华人民共和国，破坏日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平的协议，镇压东方争取和平、自由和民族独立的力量，遏止各国要求和平共处、建立集体和平的潮流，以便于推行美国称霸亚洲的战争政策和侵略政策。为了达到这个目的，美国统治集团竟不顾亚洲人民和东南亚主要国家的反对，竭力制造分裂和敌对，继续制造国际紧张局势，企图把亚洲变为酝酿新战争的温床。根据“东南亚集体防务条约”而成立的这个集团，主要是殖民国家企图控制东南亚各国的一个战争集团。
    根据美制草案而在马尼拉签订的所谓“东南亚集体防务条约”，是一个侵略性的军事联盟。这个条约在序言和条文里，虽然也用了一些“同所有的人民的所有政府和平共处”以及“保证”“以和平方法解决它们可能卷入的任何国际争端”的字句，但是，这绝不能掩盖这个条约对于东南亚及亚洲地区的和平和安全的威胁。条约的第二条和第四条，明明规定了缔约国家所承担的军事和战争义务。根据这些规定，各缔约国家不但要“分别地和共同地以持续的和有效的自助和互助的办法，维持并发展它们各别的和集体的能力”，不但对于对任何缔约国的“武装进攻”都要加以“对付”，而且对于只要是任何缔约国家认为属于“武装进攻以外的任何方式的威胁”以及“可能危及本区域和平的任何事实或情势的影响和威胁”的东西，都要“立即磋商”“应当采取的措施”。这个条约还规定，缔约国家所担承的军事和战争义务适用于“各缔约国今后可能经一致协议指定的任何国家或领土”。事情很明白，这个条约不但使缔约国家经常处于备战的状态，并且使美国侵略集团可以制造随便什么样的借口来发动战争或进行侵略，而有可能把所有的缔约国家拖入战火中去。因此，这个条约与联合国宪章的宗旨和原则是完全背道而驰的。根据这个条约而组织的东南亚军事联盟，与联合国宪章所规定的区域性组织是根本不相容的。
    东南亚军事联盟的成员国主要的不是亚洲国家。东南亚的主要国家印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸和锡兰都拒绝参加美国所召开的马尼拉会议。美国违反亚洲国家、特别是东南亚国家的愿望，强行在东南亚地区建立军事联盟，并使许多国家承担极为广泛和危险的军事义务，显然是要把这个联盟作为它分裂亚洲并实行侵略战争的工具。美联社记者从马尼拉发出的电讯中就认为：“东南亚集体防务条约”将是美国可以使用的“一条大棒”，并“使美国总统在这个地区……有较大的行动自由”。
    美国所拼凑的这个军事联盟的主要矛头，是指向着中国的。美国制订的条约草案就曾公开地把这种意图写出来，说要以“共产党”作为东南亚军事联盟的敌对目标。虽然，由于某些国家的主张，在马尼拉签订的条约的条文中把“共产党”的字样取消了，但是附在条约后面的美国的所谓“谅解”，依然表明美国所承认的敌对目标“只适用于”并不存在的所谓“共产党侵略”。参加会议的其他国家竟然也同意了这个谅解。这些国家既然把自己绑上了美国的战车，就很难摆脱美国的冒险政策为它们安排下的危险的境地。
    “东南亚集体防务条约”中的“促进经济进步和社会福利”的条款，也欺骗不了什么人。美国宣传机器向来就不掩饰这是美国诱骗更多的亚洲国家为美国侵略政策服务的钓饵；同时，也是美国垄断资本进一步扩张市场、奴役亚洲人民、排挤英法传统势力的手段。
    马尼拉会议除了签订了所谓“东南亚集体防务条约”之外，还签订了一个议定书。这个议定书公然指定柬埔寨、老挝和所谓“自由越南”为“东南亚集体防务条约”将予适用的国家和领土。这就是说，东南亚军事联盟的国家已把印度支那这三个法兰西联邦成员国家划入了它们的军事联盟的范围之内，并强迫它们承担军事义务。显然，这是公开地违反日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平的协议的。日内瓦会议的协议曾明确规定印度支那三国不得参加任何军事联盟。东南亚军事联盟国家片面地宣布对印度支那三国承担军事义务，显然是企图破坏日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平的协议，继续保持印度支那的紧张局势，以便在印度支那重新挑起战争。东南亚军事联盟的国家采取片面宣布对三国承担军事义务的手法，把三国实际包括在条约区域范围之内。这是不能不引起亚洲以及世界和平人民严重警惕的。马尼拉会议的几个主要国家对日内瓦会议的庄严协议承担了义务，它们决不能逃避因它们签订这个议定书而在印度支那引起严重后果的责任。
    马尼拉会议的国家签订了一个所谓“太平洋宪章”，标榜它们要以“维护各国人民平等权利和自决的原则”，甚至“一切国家的独立”，作为这个实际上是殖民国家的军事联盟采取“共同行动的稳固基础”。这种条文并不能减弱“东南亚集体防务条约”的侵略作用。东南亚军事联盟的操纵者随时可以制造任何的借口，干涉各国的内政，镇压民族解放运动，甚至所有反对殖民者压迫和捍卫独立主权的行动也要受到严厉的干涉。最近，美国颠覆危地马拉民主独立政府的侵略罪行，就是十分鲜明的例证。因此，很显然，这个伪善的文件中的所谓“各国的独立主权”只能是美国征服和奴役亚洲各国的幌子而已。一切尊重自己的自由和独立的亚洲国家之所以拒绝参加东南亚军事联盟，完全不是偶然的事。
    事实完全证明，东南亚军事联盟是美国推行“实力政策”的工具，是对亚洲各国和平和安全的威胁。因此，马尼拉会议的举行和“东南亚集体防务条约”的签订，立即引起了广泛的反对和谴责。印度总理尼赫鲁就指出，这个条约是非常不幸的，因为它不单没有保障和平反而危及了和平。他并认为，殖民国家及其支持者无力阻挡亚洲强大的反殖民主义的力量。这是确切不移之论。亚洲绝大多数国家反对美国拼凑的殖民国家军事联盟这一事实，将有力地证明争取集体和平的力量是不可抗拒的。美国侵略集团决然没有力量扭转亚洲的形势，它的新的冒险计划注定要遭到更惨重的失败。
    中华人民共和国政府和人民已一再宣布愿意与世界上任何国家在平等和互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不干涉内政的基础上和平共处，并为建立亚洲及全世界的集体和平作了巨大的努力。美国侵略集团和它的追随者在东南亚地区建立的军事联盟，严重地威胁着亚洲国家的和平和安全，造成了亚洲的新的紧张形势。中国人民坚决反对美国侵略集团这种敌视中国及亚洲各国人民的侵略政策，并愿意与亚洲人民及全世界爱好和平的人民共同努力，以击败美国的侵略政策，为建立亚洲及全世界的集体和平而不懈地奋斗。
