The Tragic Past of the Inner Mongolia Grasslands
What kind of life did the Inner Mongolian herdsmen in the northern Chinese grasslands lead for many generations? They drove their livestock, carried their yurts, and accompanied by the summer sun and winter blizzards, moved about the grasslands all year round. At that time, what the herdsmen owned were: a small number of livestock, a tattered sheepskin coat, a filthy yurt full of holes, and a broken pot inside. Many people spent their entire lives as slaves to feudal princes, raising livestock but never getting to eat meat themselves. The oppression and plunder by successive reactionary rulers and Japanese imperialism made the herdsmen live an extremely miserable life. The grasslands were desolate and impoverished, diseases were rampant, and the number of people and livestock decreased year by year.
Huhelete, a representative to the National People's Congress and a model worker in animal husbandry in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, grew up on such a grassland. He began herding cattle at the age of eight. At the age of eleven, his family of four became slaves to the "Jiang Gen" (equivalent to the feudal lord of the puppet district chief) and worked for twenty-three years. His annual wage was a weak animal. Huhelete loved his parents very much. When he became more sensible, he wanted to have his own livestock to support his family and no longer be a slave. He prayed to Buddha and "sacrificed to the Aobao" for this. When he was herding the master's livestock on the grassland, he would kneel alone in the wilderness and pray for a small herd of his own livestock so that his parents, who had been slaves for their entire lives, could see his livestock and be happy before they died.
However, the silent grassland never answered him. His parents died with painful hope...
The Grassland Rejoices
What Huhelete could not obtain with diligent labor and sincere prayer in the old society was quickly obtained in the new society, and he obtained more and more each year.
In August 1945, with the help of the Soviet-Mongolian Allied Forces, the people of Inner Mongolia were liberated from the occupation of Japanese imperialism. In May 1947, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was established. The people of Inner Mongolia began their new life. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region correctly implemented and carried out the policy of protecting and developing animal husbandry production in the pastoral areas, widely united the people of all nationalities and strata, and developed animal husbandry production. From the early days of liberation to 1953, the number of livestock in the region more than doubled. State-owned commercial and cooperative networks serving the pastoral areas were established on the grasslands; local industries were developed; and venereal diseases left over from the historical reactionary ruling classes were universally treated for the people in the pastoral areas, improving the people's health; the downward trend of population over the years was stopped, and the population began to increase. A new society emerged in Inner Mongolia where nationalities loved and united with each other, the grasslands were peaceful, production developed, "both people and livestock prospered," and the people lived a happy life.
The first thing the new society brought to Huhelete was that he was forever freed from the shackles of slavery and began to live a happy and free life of labor. In the autumn of 1950, in response to the call of the People's Government, he tried to organize a hay-making mutual aid group with three other herdsmen. As a result, each family made more than twice as much hay as those who worked alone. Huhelete was therefore selected as a model worker and participated in the All-Hulunbuir League Model Worker Conference. He felt the glory of labor for the first time. That winter, the People's Government of the Autonomous Region universally issued production loans to poor herdsmen, and each of the four herdsmen in Huhelete's mutual aid group received a loan of one hundred sheep from the government. They originally had only forty-one livestock in total. When they received the four hundred sheep loaned by the government, how happy they were! "At that time, in our eyes," Huhelete said, recalling the scene at the time, "four hundred sheep were like countless flocks of sheep, covering the entire grassland. As the flock approached, the 'baa' sounds of the sheep and the cheers of the people mixed into one. In the past, each of our families only had a few livestock lying next to our dilapidated yurts, and both people and livestock were very lonely. Suddenly having so many livestock made the grassland lively, and people became extra nervous and busy."
Beginning to Understand the Strength of the Collective
Their mutual aid group was originally temporary. With so many livestock added at once, each family lacked tools, and it was difficult to graze alone, so everyone decided to continue the mutual aid for a long time and graze together as a group.
The mutual aid group smoothly passed the first winter. By the second spring, when the ice and snow thawed and the water and grass sprouted, the four hundred loaned sheep had given birth to more than two hundred lambs, some even giving birth to twins. This was the first time they had received so many lambs! Some lambs didn't have enough milk, so the women held the lambs in their arms and fed them with milk bottles made of cow horns. Some ewes didn't recognize their lambs, so they held the lambs next to the ewes and sang a "lamb recognition" song:
"The water bird is flying,
The grass is sprouting,
Your baby will grow up white and fat.
Mother doesn't love him,
The lamb is lonely and about to die!
Kind ewe,
Please be close to your baby..."
The lambs all grew fat and strong. In the autumn, each family used the sheared wool to make new felt, and the group leader Huhelete also made a yurt. This was the first time in Huhelete's life that he lived in a brand new yurt. He couldn't sit still inside, and would go outside to take a look and touch the new felt. In this warm and sturdy yurt, he thought of his wife who died in the old society. He said that at that time, they lived in yurts made of reeds, covered with rotten mud. On blizzard nights, he and his wife took turns guarding the master's livestock in the wild. How cold those nights were! Their bodies were frozen solid in the wild, but they couldn't get warm even when they returned to the yurt. His wife fell ill from the cold and couldn't afford treatment. The wind howled around the dilapidated yurt, and Huhelete watched her slowly die in her illness.
Huhelete moved into a new yurt, and he talked about his new life to everyone he met. Some old friends rode horses from far away to see him, and the story of their mutual aid group spread across the grassland.
The surrounding herdsmen heard that the mutual aid group could raise livestock well, develop quickly, and improve their lives, so some imitated the method of Huhelete's mutual aid group and organized themselves automatically, and nineteen households requested to join Huhelete's mutual aid group. In the spring of 1952, Huhelete's mutual aid group absorbed four more herdsmen. The mutual aid group expanded, and the strength of the collective became greater.

No Longer Afraid of Winter, No Longer Afraid of Wolves
In the past, ordinary herdsmen lived a completely nomadic life, with their families moving with the water and grass all year round. This nomadic and unsettled life was very detrimental to people's health; at the same time, it was not convenient to build better sheds and pens for livestock and store feed, making it difficult to resist natural disasters. Based on this situation, the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region called on the herdsmen throughout the region to gradually implement the method of "settled nomadism" (i.e., some people settle down, and some people go out to nomadism) from 1951. In this way, on the one hand, natural grasslands can be used to allow livestock to eat good grass; on the other hand, the people who stay in the settlements can build sheds and pens for livestock, prepare winter feed, learn culture, improve hygiene, and gradually build some houses. On this basis, a center for the economic, political, and cultural life of the herdsmen can be gradually formed.
After Huhelete's mutual aid group expanded, it divided all nineteen laborers in the group, male and female, into three parts: settlement, nomadism, and sideline production, and chose a place with good water and grass as a settlement, gradually starting a life of "settled nomadism." By 1953, under the creation and leadership of group leader Huhelete, giving play to collective strength, and after overall planning, a large livestock pen that sheltered from wind and snow was built with adobe, willow branches, and mud. This livestock pen had an area of ​​nearly 70,000 square feet, with separate pens for camels, horses, cattle, and sheep, which could accommodate all of the mutual aid group's more than 2,000 livestock. Each type of livestock was raised in separate pens according to different categories, such as sheep pens divided into resting sheep pens, Merino sheep sheds, lamb rooms, and pregnant sheep pens. The livestock pen also had windbreaks, sunny fields, ventilation windows, and a dedicated person responsible for cleaning and sanitation, keeping the pen warm and clean.
Huhelete's mutual aid group also borrowed a horse-drawn mower from the government and bought their own rake. In winter, they no longer worried about the lack of sheds and pens for livestock and winter feed like in the past.
In the past, herdsmen were unable to overcome natural disasters, and herdsmen dared not fight wolves that ate livestock. People said: "Wolves are sky dogs, killing one will bring a pack." There was no way to treat sick livestock, and they watched it die. Now the herdsmen realize that natural disasters can be gradually overcome by human power. The herdsmen launched a "wolf-beating and livestock-protecting" campaign. In the past few years, tens of thousands of wolves have been killed throughout the region, and they no longer harm livestock as rampantly as in the past. The People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has trained a large number of veterinary technicians in recent years. Most leagues and banners have established veterinary work stations, and herdsmen have begun to use scientific methods to treat livestock diseases. Nayintai, a member of Huhelete's mutual aid group, studied at the veterinary training class run by the Banner People's Government, and became the "veterinary expert" of the mutual aid group after returning. Now they have more than a dozen common medicines in their mutual aid group, and can treat common livestock diseases themselves.
Huhelete's mutual aid group also bought Sanhe stallions, Soviet bulls, and Merino sheep to improve livestock breeds.

More Livestock, Better Life
The livestock of Huhelete's mutual aid group is developing rapidly. Taking the four households that initially participated in the mutual aid group as an example, in the three years from 1950 to the autumn of 1953, the livestock they raised increased from 600 (including 40 private livestock, 400 government-loaned sheep, and 160 sheep raised as "Suruk" - renting out other people's livestock) to 1,478, an increase of nearly one and a half times. The private livestock of the four households increased from 40 to 602 (including the sheep loaned from the government and the remuneration obtained from "Suruk" sheep).
The development of livestock has brought them a prosperous life. By 1953, six of the eight households in the mutual aid group had moved into new yurts. The inside of the yurts was tidy and clean: the beds were padded with leather mattresses and covered with floral bed sheets (in the past, they slept on the ground with a piece of felt), and there were cloth quilts; the eating utensils were washed clean and covered with cloth. White flour and rice became their regular food; the consumption of brick tea and cloth increased greatly. The clothes they wore included large leather robes and small leather robes, and everyone had two shirts to wash and change. The mutual aid group also had its own film projector and gramophone.
Huhelete and his group members were not satisfied with their current lives. After publicity and education on the general task of the country's transition period, the group members saw the socialist future of animal husbandry development, and established an animal husbandry production cooperative in June this year. Huhelete was elected chairman by the fourteen herdsmen in the cooperative.
Huhelete was a slave in the old society, but became a master in the new society; he obtained a happy life and led people to create a happier future. He gained social respect and honor through his own labor. He was elected as a model worker in animal husbandry in Inner Mongolia, and was also elected as a representative to the National People's Congress. His happiness is the happiness that all the people of Inner Mongolia have obtained in the era of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao's leadership, and his glory is also the glory of all the people of Inner Mongolia.

    内蒙古草原牧民的欢乐
    林沫　阿拉坦
    内蒙古草原凄凉的往日
    在北中国草原上的内蒙古牧民，许多世代以来曾过着什么样的生活呢？他们赶着牲畜，带着蒙古包，伴着夏天的太阳和冬天的暴风雪，终年四季在草原上游动着。那时，牧民自己所有的是：不多的牲畜，一身破烂的羊皮袄，污黑的蒙古包到处是窟窿，里边放着一口破锅。有许多人终生给封建王公当奴隶，他们养育着牲畜，自己却得不到肉吃。历代反动统治者及日本帝国主义的压迫和掠夺，使牧民过着极度悲惨的生活。草原是荒凉的、贫困的，疾病流行，人和牲畜逐年减少。
  全国人民代表大会代表、内蒙古自治区牧业劳动模范胡和勒泰过去就生长在这样的草原上。他八岁就给人放牛，十一岁时，一家四口人去给“将根”（相当于伪区长的封建主）当奴隶，一直干了二十三年。每年的工资是一头瘦弱的牲畜。胡和勒泰是很爱自己的父母的，当他比较懂事的时候，就很想自己能有牲畜养家，不再给人当奴隶。他为这事拜佛爷、“祭敖包”。当他赶着主人的畜群在草原上放牧的时候，就一个人跪在旷野上祷告，祈求自己能有一小群牲畜，好让当了一辈子奴隶的父母，在临终以前能看见自己的牲畜，心里快乐。
    但是，沉默的草原从来也不回答他。他的父母含着痛苦的希望死去了……。
    草原上欢乐起来了
    在旧社会，胡和勒泰用辛勤的劳动和虔诚的祈祷所得不到的东西，在新社会很快地就得到了，而且一年比一年得到的更多。
    一九四五年八月，在苏蒙联军的帮助下，内蒙人民从日本帝国主义的侵占下解放了。一九四七年五月，在中国共产党领导下成立了内蒙古自治区人民政府。内蒙古的人民开始了自己的新的生活。内蒙古自治区人民政府在中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，在牧业区正确执行和贯彻了保护与发展牧业生产的方针和各项政策，广泛地团结了各民族、各阶层的人民，发展了牧业生产。从解放初期到一九五三年，全区牲畜头数增加了一倍多。在草原上，建立了为牧区人民服务的国营商业和合作社网；发展了地方工业；并普遍为牧区人民医治了历史上反动统治阶级遗留下来的性病，提高了人民健康水平；多年来的人口下降趋势停止了，人口开始增加了。在内蒙古出现了一个民族友爱团结、草原平静、生产发展、“人畜两旺”、人民过着幸福生活的新社会。
    新社会给胡和勒泰带来的第一件事，就是使他永远摆脱了奴隶的枷锁，开始过着愉快的、自由劳动的生活。一九五零年秋天，响应人民政府的号召，他试着和另外三户牧民组织了一个打草互助组。结果，每家打的草比单干的人多过一倍。胡和勒泰因此被选为劳动模范，参加了全呼纳盟的劳动模范大会。他第一次感到了劳动的光荣。这年冬天，自治区人民政府普遍给贫苦牧民发放生产贷款，胡和勒泰互助组的四户牧民每家得到政府贷给一百只羊。他们四户人原来总共只有四十一头牲畜，当接到政府贷给的四百只羊时，大家是多么高兴啊！“那时，在我们眼里，”胡和勒泰讲起当时的情景，“四百只羊像是无数的羊群，布满了整个草原。羊群走近了，羊的‘咩咩’的叫声和人的欢呼混成一片。过去，我们每家只有几头牲畜卧在破烂的蒙古包旁边，人和牲畜都是很寂寞的。一下有了这么多牲畜，草原马上热闹起来，人也额外紧张、忙碌起来了。”
    开始认识了集体的力量
    他们的互助组原是临时性的，一次添了这么多牲畜，各家都缺少用具，单独放牧都有困难，大家就决定长期互助下去，合群放牧。
    互助组顺利地度过了第一个冬天。到第二年春天，冰雪开冻、水草发青的时候，四百只贷的羊就下了二百多只羊羔，有的还下了双羔。他们是第一次接下这么多羊羔呀！有的羊羔奶不够吃，妇女们就把羊羔抱在怀里，用牛角做的奶瓶喂它们。有的母羊不认羔，她们就把羊羔抱在母羊身边，唱起“认羔”的歌儿：
    “水鸟飞来啦，
    草儿发芽啦，
    你的娃娃要长得雪白肥胖。
    妈妈不爱他，
    羊羔孤独地快要死了啊！
    好心的母羊哪，
    快亲近你的娃娃吧……”
    羊羔个个长的又肥又壮，到秋天，各家都用剪下的羊毛做了新毡子，组长胡和勒泰还做了一个蒙古包。这是胡和勒泰生来头一次住上崭新的蒙古包。他在里边坐不住，一会儿到外边看看，用手摸摸那新毡子。在这样又暖和、又结实的蒙古包里，他又想起在旧社会死去的妻子了。他说，那时他们住的是苇子做的蒙古包，上面糊着些烂泥巴。在暴风雪的夜里，他和妻子轮流在野外看守着主人的牲畜。那样的夜里是多么冷啊！在野外浑身都冻成冰了，但回到蒙古包里也暖和不了。妻子冻病了，又没钱医治，大风围着破烂的蒙古包呼啸着，胡和勒泰眼看着她在病中慢慢地死去。
    胡和勒泰住上了新的蒙古包，他碰到人就谈起自己的新生活。有些老朋友很远骑着马来看他，他们互助组的事也就在草原上传开了。
    周围的牧民们听说互助组能把牲畜饲养得好，发展得快，能够更好地改善生活，有的就仿照胡和勒泰互助组的办法，自动组织起来，并有十九户人要求参加胡和勒泰互助组。一九五二年春天，胡和勒泰互助组又吸收了四户牧民。互助组扩大了，集体的力量更大了。
    不再怕冬天，不再怕狼
    过去，一般牧民完全过着游牧生活，一家老小终年四季逐水草而居。这样游动不定的生活，很不利于人的健康；同时也不便给牲畜搭盖较好的棚圈和储备饲料，难以抵抗自然灾害。内蒙古自治区人民政府根据这种情况，从一九五一年就号召全区牧民逐步实行“定居游牧”的办法（即一部分人定居下来，一部分人出外游牧）。这样，一方面可以利用自然草原，使牲畜吃到好草；一方面留在定居地的人，可以给牲畜搭盖棚圈，准备过冬饲料，自己可以学习文化，改进卫生，渐渐还可以造些房子。在这个基础上，就可以渐渐形成牧民的经济、政治和文化生活的中心。
    胡和勒泰互助组扩大后，就把全组男女十九个劳动力分为定居、游牧、副业生产三部分，选择水草好的地方作为定居地，渐渐过起“定居游牧”的生活。到一九五三年，在组长胡和勒泰的创设和领导下，发挥集体力量，经过通盘筹划，用土坯、柳条和泥修盖了一座避风雪的大畜圈。这座畜圈面积将近七万平方尺，里边骆驼、马、牛、羊圈都有，能容纳互助组的全部二千多头牲畜。每种牲畜又按不同类别分圈饲养，如羊圈中又分卧羊圈、美利奴羊棚、羊羔房、孕羊圈等。畜圈还有挡风笆、向阳场、通风窗，并有专人负责清洁卫生工作，使圈内保持温暖、干净。
    胡和勒泰互助组还从政府贷到了马拉割草机，自己买了搂草机。冬天，他们不再像过去那样为牲畜缺乏棚圈和过冬饲料担心发愁了。
    在过去，牧民们无力战胜自然灾害，狼吃了牲畜牧民不敢打。人们说：“狼是天狗，打死一只要来一群。”牲畜得了病也无法医治，看着它死。现在牧民们认识到自然灾害是可以逐渐用人力战胜的。牧民们展开了“打狼保畜”运动，几年来全区打死了几万只狼，它们再也不像过去那样猖狂地为害牲畜了。内蒙古自治区人民政府几年来培养了大批兽医技术人员，大部分盟、旗都设立了兽医工作站，牧民们已开始用科学方法给牲畜治病。胡和勒泰互助组组员那银太，曾到旗人民政府办的兽医训练班学习，回来后成了互助组的“兽医专家”。现在他们互助组有十几种常备药品，牲畜的普通病症都可以自己医治了。
    胡和勒泰互助组还买了三河种马、苏联种牛和美利奴羊来改良牲畜品种。
    牲畜更多了，生活更好了
    胡和勒泰互助组的牲畜很快地发展着。拿最初参加互助组的四户人来看，从一九五零年到一九五三年秋的三年中，他们养的牲畜由六百只（包括私有牲畜四十只、政府贷羊四百只、养“苏鲁克”——租放别人的牲畜——羊一百六十只）繁殖到一千四百七十八只，增殖将近一倍半。四户人私有的牲畜，则由四十只增加到六百零二只（包括从政府贷的羊和“苏鲁克”羊所得报酬）。
    牲畜的发展给他们带来了丰裕的生活，到一九五三年，互助组八户人有六户已经住上新的蒙古包。包里边整齐、清洁：床上垫着皮褥子，铺着花被单（过去是铺一块毡子睡在地下），放着布被子；饮食用具洗刷得干干净净，上面盖着布。白面、大米成为他们的经常食物；砖茶、布疋用量大大增加了。穿的衣服有大皮袄、小皮袄，每人都有两件洗换的衬衣。互助组还有自己的幻灯机和留声机。
    胡和勒泰和他的组员们并没有满足于现有的生活。经过关于国家过渡时期总任务的宣传教育，组员们看清了牧业发展的社会主义前途，在今年六月建立了牧业生产合作社。胡和勒泰被全社十四户牧民选为社长。
    胡和勒泰在旧社会是奴隶，到新社会成了主人；他获得了幸福的生活，又领导人们创造更加幸福的未来。他用自己的劳动获得了社会的尊敬和荣誉。他被选为内蒙古的牧业劳动模范，又被选为全国人民代表大会的代表。他的幸福是全内蒙古人民在共产党、毛主席领导的时代所获得的幸福，他的光荣更是全内蒙古人民的光荣。
