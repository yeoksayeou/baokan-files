Xinhua News Agency, September 14th. The leading organ of the East China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently issued a circular of commendation to the troops fighting against Chiang Kai-shek's naval and air forces on the Fujian front for their victories.

Recently, our frontline troops in Fujian inflicted heavy blows on Chiang Kai-shek's naval and air forces. The circular stated that the detailed battle results that have now been verified are as follows: On September 3rd and 10th, our coastal defense artillery fiercely bombarded the Chiang Kai-shek troops on Kinmen Island, sinking one Chiang Kai-shek naval gunboat and one transport ship, and damaging three submarine chasers (including one severely damaged) and one tugboat. They also destroyed the Shuitou active pier on Greater Kinmen, and completely annihilated a howitzer company of the Chiang Kai-shek troops on Lesser Kinmen. In the seven days from September 4th to 10th, our anti-aircraft artillery units shot down a total of eleven Chiang Kai-shek aircraft and damaged twenty-seven Chiang Kai-shek aircraft in the Xiamen area and other locations.

The circular stated that due to the arduous and tenacious fighting of the commanders and fighters of the participating troops, great results were achieved, and Chiang Kai-shek's army suffered severe blows. Therefore, all participating troops are given a circular of commendation as a reward.

The circular finally called on all coastal defense troops of the East China Military Region to make persistent efforts and prepare to inflict even heavier blows on Chiang Kai-shek's army.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, September 12th. The people along the coast of Fujian Province have enthusiastically launched various activities to support the frontline.

The militia in coastal areas have further strengthened patrol and sentry duties, closely monitoring the activities of Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft and warships day and night, protecting the safety of roads, bridges, and warehouses, and actively learning military techniques. The entire militia of a coastal township in Nan'an County recently held an exercise to coordinate with the People's Liberation Army in annihilating the enemy. In some places, the militia are also actively sailing out to sea to assist the People's Liberation Army in monitoring and scouting the activities of the Chiang Kai-shek troops entrenched on the islands.

Many fishermen and boatmen have voluntarily registered with local governments and fishermen's associations and other organizations, expressing their willingness to contribute to the battle to liberate Taiwan. In Yongning Port Militia Backbone Company, Jinjiang County, more than 90% of the militia have registered to participate in various frontline support activities. Three or four stretcher teams have now been universally organized in coastal villages, equipped with complete stretcher equipment. The important roads and avenues are well maintained by the nearby masses, who enthusiastically help road maintenance workers carry sand and stones, piling them on both sides of the road in preparation for use. A few days ago, there were several heavy rains in the southern Fujian coastal area, and some road surfaces were flooded and pitted. The masses immediately and automatically paved the pits.

    【新华社十四日讯】中国人民解放军华东军区领导机关最近通报表扬在福建前线与蒋贼海、空军作战取得胜利的部队。
    最近我福建前线部队曾给予蒋贼海、空军以沉重的打击。通报中说，据现已查明的详细战果如下：在九月三日和十日，我海防炮兵猛烈轰击金门岛蒋贼军，共击沉蒋贼海军炮艇和运输船各一艘，击伤驱潜舰三艘（内重伤一艘）、拖轮一只，击毁大金门水头活动码头一个，全部消灭小金门蒋贼军一个榴弹炮连。在九月四日到十日的七天中，我高射炮部队在厦门等地区共击落蒋贼飞机十一架，击伤蒋贼飞机二十七架。
    通报说，由于参战部队指战员艰苦顽强地战斗，取得了很大战绩，给蒋贼军以严重打击。为此特给所有参战部队以通报表扬的奖励。
    通报最后号召华东军区各海防部队，再接再厉，准备给蒋贼军以更沉重的打击。
    【新华社福州十二日电】福建省沿海人民已热烈展开各种支援前线的活动。
    沿海各地的民兵都进一步加强了巡逻放哨等工作，日夜严密监视蒋贼飞机和军舰的活动，保护公路桥梁和仓库的安全，并积极学习军事技术。南安县滨海的一个乡的全体民兵最近举行了一次配合解放军歼敌的演习。有些地方的民兵还积极驾船出海协助解放军监视、侦察盘踞海岛的蒋贼军队的活动。
    很多渔民、船工已自动向当地政府及渔民协会等组织报名愿在解放台湾的战斗中作出贡献。晋江县永宁港民兵基干连有百分之九十以上的民兵已报名要求参加各种支援前线活动。沿海各乡现在已普遍组织了三、四队担架队，配齐了担架设备。重要的公路和大道都由附近群众保养得很好，他们热情帮助养路工人挑砂挑石，堆在公路两旁，准备应用。前几天，闽南沿海一带下了几场大雨，部分公路的路面积水成坑，路旁群众立即自动把坑铺平。
