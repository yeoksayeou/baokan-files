Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, 6th: According to Vietnam News Agency, at the South Vietnam Joint Armistice Commission meeting, the Vietnamese and French sides reached an agreement to guarantee the strict implementation of the ceasefire order and to protect the freedom and safety of residents.

At the committee's August 31st meeting, the representative of the South Vietnam Command of the Vietnam People's Army pointed out that the Vietnam People's Army had correctly and conscientiously implemented the ceasefire order and subsequently regrouped at the designated locations within the scheduled time. He then cited many concrete pieces of evidence to illustrate that the French Union forces in South Vietnam had committed many acts of sabotage against the armistice agreement, particularly intimidating residents and delaying the handover of prisoners of war.

Subsequently, at the suggestion of the South Vietnam Command of the Vietnam People's Army, the two sides reached an agreement. This agreement stipulates that all armed activities endangering residents are prohibited in order to fully guarantee residents' freedom and democratic rights, lives, and property.

The two sides also agreed that the competent authorities on both sides, within their respective jurisdictions, have full power to punish those who are detrimental to the implementation of the Geneva Accords, detrimental to peace, detrimental to guaranteeing the people's freedom and democratic rights, and inflammatory acts.

Regarding the issue of prisoners of war, both sides believe it is necessary to correctly implement the agreements reached in Trung Gia regarding the transfer and treatment of prisoners of war.
