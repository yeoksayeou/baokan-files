Southwest Regions Pay Attention to Developing Secondary Education
The Number of New Students Enrolled This Year in the Entire Region Has Increased Significantly

The number of new students enrolled in secondary schools in the Southwest region this year has increased compared to last year. The number of senior high school students increased by more than 18%, and junior high school students increased by more than 63%.

The Party and the People's Government are extremely concerned about the younger generation and have actively utilized the potential of existing schools and, based on possible conditions, have focused on developing secondary education. This year, 19 new secondary schools have been built in the entire Southwest region, with a total construction area of more than 217,000 square meters. These new secondary schools are distributed in cities with concentrated populations, industrial and mining areas, and ethnic minority areas in Chongqing Municipality and Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Xikang provinces. Various places have also actively expanded existing secondary schools. More than 80 secondary schools have been expanded in Sichuan Province, and the capacity of the schools after expansion has greatly increased. After the expansion of Chongqing No. 25 Middle School, it increased from more than ten classes to sixty classes. Most of these new construction and expansion projects have been completed, and some are under intense construction, in order to ensure that new students can enroll on time in the fall.

Urban secondary schools with the appropriate conditions have decided to open half-day, two-shift classes. This fall, secondary schools in Chongqing and a few suburban secondary schools will run half-day, two-shift classes. The number of two-shift classes added in the city has increased from the original 42 classes to 118 classes. The Chongqing Education Bureau established a normal college as early as the beginning of this year. The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chongqing Municipal People's Government transferred hundreds of cadres with high school education or above to study, preparing a large number of teachers for the key development of secondary education.

This year, the admission lists for new students have been announced successively in various places. For students who have not been admitted, local Party committees, people's governments, and youth leagues are actively assisting them in engaging in labor production or organizing them for self-study.

    西南各地注意发展中等教育
    全区今年录取新生人数大有增加
    西南全区中等学校今年录取的新生人数比去年有增加。计高中增加了百分之十八以上，初中增加了百分之六十三以上。
    党和人民政府都极关怀青少年一代，积极地发挥了现有学校的潜力，并根据可能条件，重点地发展中学教育。全西南区今年新建的中学有十九所，建筑总面积达二十一万七千多平方公尺。这些新建的中学分布在重庆市和四川、贵州、云南、西康等省人口集中的城市、工矿区及少数民族地区。各地并积极扩建现有中学。四川省扩建的中学有八十多所，学校扩建后的容量大大增加。重庆市第二十五中学扩建以后，由原来的十多个班，增加到六十班。这些新建和扩建的校舍工程，大都已完工，有的正紧张修建，以争取使秋季入学新生能按时入学。
    城市中有条件的中学，已决定开办半日二部制班。重庆市区各中学和少数郊区的中学，今秋都要办半日二部制班，全市增办的二部制班，由原来的四十二班增加到一百一十八班。重庆市教育局早在今年初就开办了师范专科学校一所，中共重庆市委员会和重庆市人民政府抽调了数百名具有高中以上文化水平的干部去学习，为重点地发展中学教育准备了大量师资。
    今年各地招考新生的录取名单已先后公布，各地凡未被录取的学生，各地党委、人民政府和青年团等有关单位正积极协助他们从事劳动生产或组织他们自学。
