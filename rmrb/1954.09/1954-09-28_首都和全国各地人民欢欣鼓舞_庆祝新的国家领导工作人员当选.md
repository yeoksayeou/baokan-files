Beijing

[This newspaper report] Yesterday, more than three million people in the capital spent an unforgettable day in jubilation. When the names of the new national leaders were broadcast from loudspeakers, cheers, firecrackers, and gongs and drums immediately resounded throughout the city. The people of the city felt infinite glory and happiness for the election of Mao Zedong, the most beloved leader of the Chinese people, as Chairman of the People's Republic of China, Zhu De as Vice Chairman, and the election of other new national leaders. Tens of thousands of people cheered Mao Zedong's name, flocking from all directions to the brilliantly lit Tiananmen Square. Here, more than 100,000 people sang and danced to their hearts' content, forming an ocean of joy, with the cheers in the square connecting with the cheers in Huairentang.

The workers in the capital's factories turned their excitement into strength on this day, creating many new production records to pay tribute to Chairman Mao and the National People's Congress. Li Jigang's group, a model worker from the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, completed its increased production plan ahead of schedule at just after 3:00 PM yesterday. Li Jigang said to everyone, "Chairman Mao's election as Chairman of the State is the glory and happiness of the working class and the people of the whole country. In the future, we will guarantee to overfulfill the state plan and strive to build socialism." After hearing the good news, more than a thousand employees of the entire plant immediately carried giant portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong and Vice Chairman Zhu De to parade and celebrate outside the factory. On this day, the workers of the joint state-private Dahua Pottery Company were particularly energetic in their production. The workers in the molding workshop sped up their operations, making 2,400 rough castings in eight hours, compared to 2,200 in nine hours in the past. After the good news came, the young men and women workers of the Dahua Pottery Company immediately started the Yangko dance with great joy. A 56-year-old worker also participated. All the workers expressed that they would make new achievements in production and go to Tiananmen to see Chairman Mao on October 1st. The third shift of the fourth branch of the Beijing branch of the China Department Store also completed its third-quarter task ahead of schedule yesterday. The store employees and customers in the capital's stores rejoiced together. After hearing the good news, all the employees of Ruifuxiang told each other and congratulated each other. They said that they must work hard and advance along the bright socialist road indicated by Chairman Mao.

The broad masses of commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing celebrated with joy. The battalion headquarters of a meritorious battalion of a certain unit of the North China Military Region immediately held a symposium. Ge Tianyu, the deputy company commander of the Special Merit Company who had been awarded two merits, said, "Chairman Mao used to lead us from slaves to masters. He is the guide to our happy life. In the future, he will lead us into socialism. I must lead the troops to improve their skills, liberate Taiwan, and defend the socialist construction of the motherland and world peace." Liu Shugui, a second-class meritorious serviceman of a certain air force unit of the People's Liberation Army, and comrades from many units participated in the gathering on Tiananmen Square. He said to his companions very excitedly, "I know that only under the leadership of Chairman Mao can we have the happy days of today. In the future, I will resolutely work hard to complete the glorious task of liberating Taiwan!"

Hundreds of thousands of college and middle school students in the capital had been looking forward to this day for many days. Before four o'clock, people came out of classrooms, libraries, and laboratories one after another to gather in the square to listen to the radio. When the news of the election of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Zhu came out, more than 6,000 teachers, students, and staff of Renmin University of China and its affiliated Workers and Peasants' Accelerated Secondary School immediately held a torch parade to celebrate on campus. Many old professors and young students from Peking University and Tsinghua University cheered and danced together. Zhang Zigao, the 68-year-old director of the General Chemistry Teaching and Research Section of Tsinghua University, shouted excitedly in front of the loudspeaker, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Song Zhaorong, a mechanical manufacturing student who had participated in the Huaihai Campaign, said, "In the past, I was a pig-herding child. Today I can go to college, which is inseparable from Chairman Mao's leadership of the Chinese people's revolution to achieve great victory. I must study hard and contribute all my strength to building socialism under the leadership of Chairman Mao." More than 40 ethnic minorities, more than 1,500 students and faculty members of the Central University for Nationalities, wore their own ethnic costumes yesterday to welcome this happy day. Hai Bao, a Mongolian student, said, "Electing Chairman Mao is electing the happiness of all ethnic groups." A Li girl from Hainan Island burst into tears of joy after listening to the broadcast. She said, "I heard that today we are electing the chairman, vice chairman, etc. I didn't sleep well all night. In the old society, my father died when I was young, and even eating was a problem. Now I'm here to study in Beijing. Chairman Mao is closer to me than my own father." Chongwen District's Beijing No. 7 Girls' Middle School, No. 11 Boys' Middle School, and No. 50 Middle School all held celebrations and then went to Tiananmen Square for a joint celebration.

The good news spread to every hutong in the capital, and the housewives were greatly encouraged. Five or six hundred people gathered together on the bank of the Jin Yu Chi in Longxugou to listen to the radio. Yu Guirong, a coal miner's family member, a women's committee member of Jin Yu Chi, and the women's deputy director of the Dashi Xindian Police Station, said, "Before the election, I told my neighbors: We must elect Chairman Mao. Now that Chairman Mao has been elected, I will definitely do my job well under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Zhu in the future."
