    German Democratic Republic People's Chamber Sends Letter to the Federal Assembly in Bonn
    Suggesting Consultations on the German Question and European Security Issues
    [Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 19th] A TASS report from Berlin on the 19th: The German News Agency reports that the Presidium of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic has written to Mr. Ehlers, the President of the Federal Assembly in Bonn, suggesting that the parliaments of the two parts of Germany send representatives for negotiations in order to reach an all-German agreement on the German question and the issue of guaranteeing European security.

    The letter stated: The French National Assembly's rejection of the "European Defence Community" treaty opens up new prospects for a peaceful resolution of the German question. All peace-loving residents of Germany are anticipating that the leading bodies of Germany will utilize every possibility to reach an agreement among Germans and, in the course of negotiations, create the prerequisites for easing the situation in Germany and Europe.

    The letter pointed out: The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic has more than once suggested to the West German Federal Assembly that efforts be made to peacefully resolve the German question on the basis of an agreement reached by the Germans themselves. However, the West German Federal Assembly has so far failed to positively evaluate the People's Chamber's proposals aimed at reaching a sincere agreement.

    The letter emphasized: In light of the current international situation, it is extremely urgent for representatives of the two parts of Germany to reach an agreement. The Presidium of the People's Chamber, aware of its responsibility to the German people and proceeding from the interests of safeguarding peace, once again suggests that representatives of the two German parliaments jointly study common views on resolving issues of vital importance to the German people. The letter pointed out that in the course of consultations, if both sides are sincere, the following issues can be discussed and resolved:

    1. Supporting the desire of the people of Europe (including the German people) to guarantee security and peace; 2. Reaching a common view on the issue of a peace treaty with Germany and the restoration of all-German sovereignty; 3. Unanimously supporting the convening of a conference of the four foreign ministers, with representatives from both parts of Germany participating on an equal footing to discuss the peaceful resolution of the German question, including the withdrawal of occupying forces and the signing of a European collective security treaty; 4. Jointly ensuring non-participation in any military agreements, as the consequences of these agreements are a threat to peace and an obstacle to the restoration of German unity; 5. Taking consistent steps to support efforts to prohibit atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, to halt the production of these weapons, and to prevent the placement of these weapons in Germany; 6. Developing a common view on how to prevent the rearmament of Germany and on the number, equipment, and deployment of police forces in the two parts of Germany.

    The letter also pointed out that in order to rapidly normalize relations between the eastern and western parts of Germany, to bring the two parts of Germany closer together, thereby promoting a broad all-German agreement and the restoration of German unity, an agreement can be reached on the following measures: Immediately easing and expanding domestic trade; promoting Germany's foreign trade, especially trade between Germany and its traditional trading partners in the East; restoring a unified German currency system; developing German culture; and exchanging experiences in the field of social policy. In addition, the Presidium of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic is also prepared to accept and discuss any suggestions for conducting negotiations.

    民主德国人民议院致函波恩联邦议院
    建议就德国问题和欧洲安全问题进行协商
    【新华社二十日讯】　据塔斯社柏林十九日讯：德意志通讯社消息：德意志民主共和国人民议院主席团写信给波恩联邦议院主席艾勒斯，建议德国两部分的议会派遣代表进行谈判，以便就德国问题和保障欧洲安全问题达成全德协议。
    这封信说：法国国民议会拒绝“欧洲防务集团”条约，这就为和平解决德国问题展开了新的远景。全德爱好和平的居民都在期待：德国的领导机构利用一切可能来达成德国人之间的协议，并在谈判的过程中为缓和德国和欧洲的局势创造前提。
    这封信指出：德意志民主共和国人民议院已经不止一次地建议西德联邦议院：设法争取在德国人自己取得协议的基础上和平解决德国问题。但是，西德联邦议院直到现在还没有对人民议院力求达成真诚协议的建议作积极的估价。
    这封信着重指出：从当前的国际局势看来，德国两部分的代表达成协议已经是非常急迫的事情了。人民议院主席团意识到自己对德国人民的责任，并且从保障和平的利益出发，再次建议德国两个议会的代表共同研究关于解决德国人民切身问题的共同观点。这封信指出：在协商的过程中，如果双方都有诚意，是可以讨论和解决下列问题的：
    一、支持欧洲各国人民（包括德国人民在内）要求保障安全与和平的愿望；二、就对德和约问题和恢复全德主权问题取得共同观点；三、一致支持召开四大国外长会议，德国两部分的代表在平等的基础上参加这个会议来讨论和平解决德国问题，包括撤退占领军和签订欧洲集体安全条约的问题；四、共同保证不参加任何军事协定，因为这些协定的后果是对和平的威胁和恢复德国统一的障碍；五、采取一致步骤，支持为禁止原子武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器及制止生产这些武器和制止在德国放置这些武器而作的努力；六、对如何制止重新武装德国以及对德国两部分的警察人数、装备和配置，研究出共同的观点。
    这封信还指出：为了使德国东西两部分的关系迅速正常化，为了使德国两部分接近，从而促成广泛的全德协议和恢复德国的统一，可以就下列措施达成协议：立即放宽和扩大国内贸易；促进德国的对外贸易，特别是德国和东方的传统贸易国的贸易；恢复统一的德国币制；发展德国的文化；就社会政策方面交流经验。此外，德意志民主共和国人民议院主席团还准备接受和讨论任何进行谈判的建议。
