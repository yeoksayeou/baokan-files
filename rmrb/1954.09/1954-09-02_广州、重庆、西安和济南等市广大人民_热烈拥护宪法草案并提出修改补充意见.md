Through publicity and discussion, the political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of the broad masses of people have been greatly improved, and they have expressed their determination to greet the birth of the first constitution of our country with practical actions.

In Guangzhou, 500,000 people participated in the public discussion during the publicity and discussion activities. In addition to workers, suburban farmers, cadres of organs, soldiers, students and people from all walks of life, overseas Chinese and people living on the water also participated in the discussion.

In addition to expressing their opinions and suggestions at discussion meetings, some workers in many factories and enterprises also sent their opinions directly to the Municipal Constitution Draft Discussion Committee. Through the discussion of the draft constitution, the broad masses of people have received a profound socialist education, and have actively supported the draft constitution with practical actions to complete the production plan ahead of schedule.

In Chongqing, more than 670 rapporteurs and more than 27,000 propagandists and activists made reports to the masses and organized everyone to discuss. People from all walks of life showed high political enthusiasm in the discussion. Many suburban farmers often carried torches at night to go to listen to reports several miles away, and everyone regarded the draft constitution as a "beacon." Many people actively expressed their opinions in the discussion. According to statistics, the people of the city put forward more than 1,900 suggestions for supplementation and revision. After discussion, the enthusiasm for production among workers and suburban farmers in the city has been greatly improved. The employees of the turbine workshop of the newly built Chongqing Power Plant reached 99.8% attendance rate after studying the draft constitution.
