Hebei, Shaanxi, and Other Provinces Actively Prepare to Purchase New Cotton

[This Newspaper’s Dispatch] New cotton is about to be available on the market in large quantities. Hebei, Shaanxi, Liaoning, and Rehe provinces are actively making preparations for the purchase of cotton.

In order to fulfill the state's cotton purchase plan and ensure a rational supply of cotton for textiles and civilian use, the flower, yarn, and cloth companies and supply and marketing cooperatives in these provinces have conducted detailed research in advance on this year's cotton output and purchase plans. Hebei Province has appropriately adjusted the cotton collection stations (points) based on the new cotton collection policy and the new situation. Shijiazhuang, Cangxian, and Tongxian prefectures in the province have added more than 30 cotton collection stations (points) on the original basis, increasing the number of cadres by more than 650.

In order to ensure that raw cotton can be supplied to spinning mills in a timely manner after the new cotton is available, some provinces began to overhaul cotton ginning machines in May and June. After the machine overhaul, most of the 26 state-owned cotton ginning factories in Liaoning and Rehe provinces can process and produce on time; the power cotton ginning machines overhauled in Handan, Xingtai, Shijiazhuang, Cangxian, and Tongxian prefectures in Hebei Province number 2,191, and it is planned to organize 172 manual processing stations, setting up more than 17,100 cotton ginning machines. Supply and marketing cooperatives in 40 counties (cities) including Chang'an and Xianyang in Shaanxi Province have also organized cotton ginning workers scattered in rural areas to participate in cotton ginning work.

In the preparation for purchase, the flower, yarn, and cloth companies and supply and marketing cooperatives in various provinces have transferred cotton inspection personnel to conduct strict business training and policy study. The number of cotton inspection personnel already trained is: 1,058 in Hebei Province and 1,765 in Rehe Province, which provides a strong guarantee for the implementation of national policies.

Some areas have completed preparations for the purchase of new cotton. Liaoning and other provinces have imitated and made a large number of standard cotton samples of seed cotton and lint cotton; the Hebei Provincial Cooperative Federation has purchased many scientific instruments such as electric ovens, electric moisture meters, and microscopes and distributed them to various cotton collection units. More than 400 cotton inspection personnel in Shaanxi Province have arrived at various acquisition strongholds; more than 260 baling machines have been successfully modified; and an additional 100 baling machines are being rushed to manufacture; special funds for the construction of cotton warehouses and the purchase of fire-fighting equipment have also been allocated to various grassroots acquisition units. State-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in Shaanxi Province have also prepared a large number of plant fertilizers, livestock, cloth, and general merchandise to cooperate with the purchase of new cotton.

At present, new cotton in Hanzhong, Ankang, and other places in Shaanxi Province has begun to be available on the market, and local supply and marketing cooperatives have started purchasing.

    河北陕西等省积极准备收购新棉
    【本报讯】现在新棉即将大量上市，河北、陕西、辽宁、热河等省积极进行收购棉花准备工作。
    为了实现国家收购计划，保证纺织用棉和民用棉的合理供应，这几个省的花纱布公司、供销合作社对今年棉花产量、收购计划都事先做了细致的研究。河北省根据新的收棉方针和新的情况适当调整了收棉站（点），该省石家庄、沧县、通县三个专区在原有基础上增设收棉站（点）三十余处，增加干部六百五十多人。
    为使新棉上市后，能及时将原棉供应纱厂，有些省从五、六月份就开始检修轧花车。辽宁和热河两省的二十六处国营轧花厂经过机器检修以后，大部都能按时加工生产；河北省邯郸、邢台、石家庄、沧县、通县五个专区检修的动力轧花车有二千一百九十一台，并计划组织人力加工站一百七十二处，设置轧花车一万七千一百多台。陕西省长安、咸阳等四十个县（市）的供销合作社并组织了散布在农村的轧花工人参加轧花工作。
    在收购准备工作中，各省花纱布公司、供销合作社都抽调棉花检验人员，进行严格的业务训练和政策学习。已经训练的棉花检验人员：河北省有一千零五十八人；热河省一千七百六十五人，这对贯彻国家政策提供了有力保证。
    有些地区的收购新棉已经准备就绪，辽宁等省仿做了大批籽、皮棉标准棉样；河北省合作总社购置了电烘箱、电感测潮器、显微镜等许多科学仪器分发到各收棉单位。陕西省的四百多名棉花检验人员已经到达各收购据点；二百六十多部打包机已经改装成功；另外增加的一百部打包机正在赶制；修建棉花仓库和购置消防设备的专款也都拨到各收购基层单位。陕西省国营商业部门和供销合作社还准备了大批植物肥料、牲畜和布匹、百货，配合收购新棉进行供应。
    目前，陕西省汉中、安康等地的新棉已经开始上市，当地供销合作社已开秤收购。
