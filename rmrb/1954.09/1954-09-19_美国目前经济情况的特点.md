    Characteristics of the Current U.S. Economic Situation
    By Manukyan, Soviet Union

    U.S. economists, politicians, and commentators have long been painstakingly trying to prove that a crisis is impossible in the United States under the current circumstances. During 1953-1954, although the decline in industrial production was already quite obvious, they still tried to make people believe that there was no crisis in the United States, but only a phenomenon that they couldn't name. Now they want to convince people that if anything ever happened, it's all over now.

    However, the more these arbitrary arguments are made, the more doubt they cause abroad and at home. Any capitalist knows very well that when a person's business is in a normal and smooth state, he does not need to try so hard to convince everyone of his ability to pay. But he should be wary of those who swear and try to convince people that his business is going well.

    People understand President Eisenhower’s recent, clearly unusual move in this way: instead of submitting a detailed semi-annual economic report to Congress as usual, he issued a brief, overly optimistic statement saying, "The deterioration of the U.S. economic health that occurred not long ago has stopped in the middle of this year. As it stands now, the prospects are good. The recession that occurred was not very significant..."

    The President's assurance of all is well did not even please American entrepreneurs. They saw that the facts and figures published in the newspapers every day had overturned the President's optimistic arguments.

    In March 1954, the President announced that he would undertake new purchases of several raw materials as strategic reserves, primarily lead and zinc. This happened shortly after a meeting between the President and senators and representatives from states that produce lead and zinc. These senators and representatives had said that in these states, zinc mining in 1953 decreased by 19 percent compared to 1952 and was continuing to decrease. The representative from Nevada reported that zinc mining in his state had decreased by more than half.

    The Miners' Union made the following observations about the situation in the industrial sector: "For the first time, all cities in the western region have experienced large-scale unemployment and small business bankruptcies since the depression of the 1930s. In our industrial sector, thousands of workers have been laid off. The working hours and wages of those who continue to work have also been reduced. Workers in other sectors are also suffering from the threat of wage losses, as the crisis has begun to expand to these industrial sectors. Currently, one in three workers in lead and zinc mines has been laid off. Whether in the United States or in Canada, the entire region has suffered economic damage."

    Some other measures taken by the U.S. government also demonstrate not prosperity, but the difficulties and crises occurring in an increasing number of industrial sectors. For example, not long ago, import taxes on Swiss watches were raised to help the U.S. watch manufacturing industry. The Foreign Operations Administration announced that it hoped to purchase goods in the United States and distribute 10 million tons of coal among foreign consumers, which of course illustrates the serious situation in the U.S. coal mining industry.

    Isn't the fact that the Commodity Credit Corporation increased its appropriation from $8.5 billion to $10 billion to purchase agricultural products that cannot find a market enough to illustrate the serious situation in U.S. agriculture? Yes, the currently enforced 13 percent reduction in wheat planting area and 19.3 percent reduction in cotton planting area are official admissions of a serious agricultural crisis in the United States.

    Obviously, the current U.S. government also does not believe its claim that the U.S. economic situation has not lost hope of improvement, and it is attempting to support some individual industrial sectors with government orders. According to the provisions of the 1954-1955 budget, the total value of naval ship orders allocated by the government is $855 million, and a portion of tank orders has also been quickly allocated. Road construction contracts were allocated six months ahead of schedule. At the same time, fabric orders amounted to $60 million. In the near future, aircraft orders worth $1 billion will also have to be allocated ahead of schedule. As U.S. Secretary of Commerce Weeks explained, all of this is to give "a little stimulus" to commercial life.

    Newspapers dissatisfied with the minister's "leak of secrets" puzzlingly said: If the funds for 1955 are spent now, what will happen in 1955? The British "Economist" magazine, which has no obligation to support the official lies so enthusiastically propagated by the U.S. press, satirically said: "Such a very important 'stimulus' may prevent the Republicans from being blamed for not fighting domestic economic difficulties and can change the intolerable level of stagnation, on which the economic index has remained in recent months."

    Even without citing other materials, the actions of the U.S. government themselves reveal two important characteristics of the current U.S. economic situation: first, the general level of U.S. economic activity is in a very stagnant state, and even under the influence of the peak season, it has not exceeded the low level of January to March; second, many of the most important economic sectors in the United States, primarily production sectors such as textiles, shipbuilding, coal mining, ferrous metallurgy, zinc and lead mining, automobile, agricultural machinery, and railroad equipment manufacturing, are experiencing serious and acute crises, not to mention agriculture.

    "The Economist" wrote: "National orders are particularly needed for the two most crisis-ridden sectors - textiles and shipbuilding."

    U.S. shipyards have not received a single commercial ship order since November 1952. The number of ships built will decrease from 52 in 1953 to 3 in 1955, and the number of workers will decrease from tens of thousands to one thousand.

    The crisis situation in the textile industry, especially in the wool fabric production sector, is equally acute. In this sector, which the U.S. press calls "the unhealthiest link in the unhealthy sector," the number of workers was 148,000 in December 1949, decreased to 85,000 in December 1953, and further decreased to 70,000 in mid-1954.

    However, the textile industry is by no means the unhealthiest sector. As everyone knows, between 1946 and 1953, the mining of U.S. anthracite coal decreased by 50 percent and continues to decrease. The mining of bituminous coal was 572 million tons in 1947, decreased to 411 million tons in 1953, and now the annual level is only 336 million tons, 41.3 percent lower than in 1947. The number of workers in this industrial sector was 442,000 in 1948, decreased to 215,000 in April 1954, and is still decreasing.

    According to press reports, in the first half of 1954, the amount of steel melted and cast in the United States was 24.2 percent lower than in 1953. At the end of July 1954, the operating rate of the steel industry was lower than in the first half of the year, at 64.5 percent. The amount of melting and casting decreased by 26.2 percent compared to 1953. Fairless, the chairman of the board of directors of "U.S. Steel Corporation," which belongs to the Morgan Company system, recently announced that on July 1, 1954, the unfulfilled orders in the order book were 4 million tons, 5 million tons on April 1, 1954, and 8 million tons on July 1, 1953.

    The decrease in the amount of cast iron and steel melted has also reduced the consumption of iron ore. Between January and July 1954, 32 million tons of iron ore were transported via the Great Lakes, compared to 50 million tons in the same period in 1953. At the same time, the storage volume of ore in various enterprises is so large that only 200 out of 275 ships are sailing, and 25 ships transporting ore will be taken out of service in the near future.

    The consumption of steel by the railway sector and the railway machinery manufacturing sector is decreasing sharply. In 1954, the volume of railway transportation decreased by 12 to 14 percent compared to 1953, and by 20 to 22 percent compared to 1952. In the first half of 1954, the total revenue of railway companies decreased by 13.5 percent compared to 1953, and the net revenue decreased by 46 percent. The unfulfilled car orders in the order book were 123,947 units on January 1, 1952, and decreased to 12,169 units on June 1, 1954. The locomotive orders in the order book decreased from 1,883 on January 1, 1951, to 124 units on July 1, 1954. On June 30, 1953, the orders in the order book of "American Steel Foundries" (producing castings for railway equipment) were $50 million, and decreased to $16 million on June 30, 1954.

    Between January and June 1954, "Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton Corporation" (manufacturing railway equipment) received orders for $47.7 million, compared to $100 million between January and June 1953. The received orders were less than half of the shipment volume, which will inevitably lead to a further reduction in production.

    The situation in the agricultural equipment production sector is not much better. In mid-June 1954, "International Harvester Company" laid off 4,800 workers from its seven enterprises manufacturing agricultural machinery, and in mid-August, it laid off another 800 workers. The company pointed out when explaining the reasons for the layoffs: "At the beginning of 1954, we stipulated the operating rate of the enterprises according to the level of demand, which, in our opinion at that time, was possible. The demand in many months also met our expectations. And now, this demand is gone, and we have to adapt our production to the needs of the market, so that there is no excessive accumulation of finished products."

    The automobile industry, especially the so-called small companies, is far from prosperous. The situation of these small companies can hardly be said to be tragic. It is enough to mention the following figures: between January and June 1954, "Studebaker" sold 57 percent fewer passenger cars than in the same period in 1953. "American Motors," recently merged by "Hudson" and "Nash," sold 68 percent fewer. "Packard" sold 69 percent fewer. "Kaiser-Willys" sold 70 percent fewer. However, the deterioration of these companies' situation began in 1953. A new phenomenon in 1954 is that the third-largest automobile company, "Chrysler Corporation," has also fallen into the ranks of the disastrous "small companies." During this period, "Chrysler Corporation" sold 46 percent fewer cars. In total, in half a year, the production of trucks decreased by 13.5 percent, and the production of passenger cars decreased by 10 percent. At the same time, if the production volume from January to May 1954 decreased by 7.5 percent compared to the same period in 1953, then it decreased by 14 percent in June and 15.2 percent in July. To clearly understand the situation in this sector, it is enough to look at the situation of "Studebaker." The car production volume of this company's various enterprise units has decreased by almost 60 percent. The number of workers has decreased from 23,000 to 10,000. From February 1 to the end of July 1954, the workers who were not laid off worked an average of only two days a week. If the workers in "Studebaker's" various enterprise units worked an average of 46 hours per week in the summer of 1953, they now work less than 20 hours per week. Among the 13,000 workers who have been laid off, 9,800 have been unemployed for such a long period that they have been deprived of the right to receive unemployment benefits (the maximum period for receiving unemployment benefits in the United States is 26 weeks). The company's main enterprise in South Bend City has not started work at all for ten weeks in the past twenty-nine weeks of 1954. The company forced workers to agree to revise the wage quotas and reduce them by 14 percent.

    The prospect of a decrease in automobile production cannot but affect the situation of the steel industry. "Great Lakes Steel Corporation," which supplies steel to automobile enterprises in the Detroit area, shut down five of the seventeen open-hearth furnaces producing steel in July on the pretext that automobile companies had a lot of steel in storage. For this reason, the company's enterprise load factor decreased from 69 percent to 49.1 percent.

    On the surface, there is no change in the current U.S. economic front, but everywhere in the various economic sectors in the United States, the phenomenon of a large number of enterprises closing down is occurring. The threat of enterprise closures and the closures themselves are used as tools to deal with the strike movement, increase labor intensity, and reduce wage quotas. Enterprises in areas where workers are more organized and wage quotas are higher are the first to close down.

    It can be said that all these sectors combined are not the entire U.S. economy. In 1933, a committee of the Senate had used this argument. At that time, someone asked a financial giant who testified on the U.S. economic situation whether there had been serious unemployment, the collapse of large banks, and large-scale bankruptcies of farmers, etc. He answered all the questions: "Yes, in some individual places," "Yes, in some individual regions." In the end, the witness's shameless behavior even aroused the anger of senators who were already accustomed to this set of tricks.

    One senator shouted: "Of course, it's in some individual places! It's just that these individual places are connected to Canada in the north, bordered by Mexico in the south, bordered by the Pacific Ocean in the west, and bordered by the Atlantic Ocean in the east, and these individual places are called the United States..."

    Eisenhower's very optimistic statement may not increase the level of industrial production and the level of railway transportation, but this statement is a windfall for those who are bullish on the stock exchange and those who use easy and cheap loans for construction and expect to find buyers.

    And it is precisely in these areas that, even without new stimuli, there are many "flammable materials" that can cause major shocks.

                    ×　×　×

    In order to prove that the U.S. economy seems to have "recovered," U.S. economists cite the following industrial production index, which (with seasonal fluctuations taken into account) has dropped from 137 in July 1953 (1948-49 as 100) to 123 in March and April 1954, and remained at the level of 124 in May, June, and July.

    But no matter how it is explained, this number can only show that the decline in industrial production has stopped to the extent reflected in the index. The history of past crises has had periods of stagnation in this decline. If the crises of 1920-1921 and 1937-1939 were characterized by continuous and comprehensive, but relatively short-term and jump-like declines, then the crisis of 1929-1933 was characterized by intermittent, more severe and persistent declines.

    When the U.S. production level is 9 percent lower than in 1953, there are 5 million fully unemployed workers and 10 million partially unemployed workers, the phenomenon of enterprise bankruptcy has increased significantly, and crises exist in sectors such as agriculture, mining, shipbuilding, textiles, steel, and the automobile industry, it is probably not appropriate for U.S. economists, commentators, and members of Congress to insist that the U.S. economy has "recovered."

    Economists at the U.S. Federal Reserve Board can freely explain the sharp decline in the absolute volume of industrial production in July (5.6 percent in one month), as reflected in the index listed above, as a temporary and seasonal phenomenon. At the same time, it is clear that the particularly long shutdown time of factories in summer and the long time to change models, as well as many other situations, are used to reduce production, and therefore, naturally reflect the diversity of the impact of the developing economic crisis.

    美国目前经济情况的特点
    苏联　马努基扬
    美国经济学家、政治家和政论家很久以来就在煞费苦心地证明，在目前的情况下，美国不可能发生危机。在一九五三——一九五四年内，虽然工业生产的衰退现象已经十分明显，但他们还想使人相信，在美国没有什么危机，而只有一种他们也叫不出什么名字的现象。现在他们又想使人相信：如果曾发生过什么的话，那么现在也都已经过去了。
    然而，这种武断的论调说得愈多，它在国外以至国内引起的怀疑也就愈大。任何一个资本家都很清楚，当一个人的事业处于正常顺利的状态时，他就用不着硬要使一切人都相信他的支付能力。但是，他要提防那些对人发誓并想使人相信他的事业进行得很顺利的人。
    人们正是抱着这样的态度来了解美国总统最近所采取的显然并非寻常的做法：他不是按照惯例向国会提出详细的半年经济报告，而是发表一个简短的、过分乐观的声明，该声明中这样说：“不久以前曾发生过的美国经济健康的恶化现象，在本年年中已停止了。就目前看来，远景也是好的。曾发生过的衰退是不很大的……”
    总统的万事如意的保证，甚至没有使美国企业家们高兴。他们看到，报纸上每天发表的事实和数字已经推翻了总统的乐观的论调。
    一九五四年三月，总统宣布了将对作为战略物资储备用的几种原料——首先是铅和锌——从事新的采购。这是在总统和一些代表产铅和锌的各州的参议员和众议员会谈之后不久发生的。这些参议员和众议员曾说过，在这些州内，一九五三年锌的开采量，比一九五二年减少了百分之十九，并且还在继续减少中。内华达州的代表报告说，他本州的锌矿开采量，减少了二分之一以上。
    矿工工会对该工业部门的情况提出了下列特点：“西部一带的所有城市都首次出现了三十年代萧条以后的大批失业和小企业主破产的现象。在我们的工业部门里，数千工人被解雇了。那些仍在继续工作的工人的工作日和工资也都减少了。其他部门的工人也正遭受着工资失掉的威胁，因为危机已开始扩大到这些工业部门。现在，在铅和锌的矿场里，每三个工人中就有一个被解雇了。无论是在美国或在加拿大，整个地区都遭受到经济的破坏。”
    美国政府采取的另外一些办法所证明的也不是繁荣，而是在越来越多的工业部门中发生的困难和危机。例如，不久以前，提高了对瑞士钟表的进口税，就是为了帮助美国的钟表制造业。“援外事务管理署”曾宣布过，它希望在美国采购货物并在外国消费者中间分配一千万吨煤，这当然可以说明美国煤矿工业的严重情况。
    难道商品信用公司把拨款从八十五亿美元增加到一百亿美元来购买找不到销路的农产品这一事实，还不足以说明美国农业的严重情况吗？是的，目前所强制实行的小麦播种面积减少百分之十三和棉花播种面积减少百分之十九点三，就是官方对美国的严重的农业危机的承认。
    显然，目前的美国政府也不相信它所提出的关于美国经济情况并没有丧失好转的希望的声明，它正企图以政府的订货来扶助一些个别的工业部门。根据一九五四—一九五五年度预算的规定，政府分配出去的军舰订货总计有八亿五千五百万美元，同样也赶快分配出一部分坦克订货。比规定日期提前了六个月来分配筑路合同。同时，布匹的订货达六千万美元。在不久的将来，也得要提前分配的飞机订货数额为十亿美元。正如美国商务部长威克斯所解释的，所有这一切都是为了给予商业生活以“少许刺激”。
    不满意这位部长“泄露秘密”的报刊，困惑不解地说：如果现在花费了供一九五五年用的资金，那么，一九五五年将怎样办呢？对于美国报刊如此热烈宣扬的官方谎言并没有支持义务的英国“经济学家”周刊讽刺说：“这样一种十分重要的‘刺激’，或许可以使共和党人不至于因为他们不向国内的经济困难作斗争而受到责难，并能改变那种使人难以忍受的停滞的水平，最近几个月内，经济的指数都停留在这个水平上。”
    即使不引用其他的材料，美国政府的行动本身也显示出美国目前经济情况中的两个重要特点：第一、美国经济活动的一般水平陷于非常停滞的状态，甚至在旺季的影响下也没有超过一月至三月的低水平；第二、美国的许多最重要的经济部门，首先是像纺织业、造船业、采煤业、黑色冶金业、锌矿和铅矿开采业、汽车、农业机器和铁路设备制造业等生产部门，正经受着严重的和尖锐的危机，更不用说农业了。
    “经济学家”周刊写道：“国家的订货对于两个危机最严重的部门——纺织业和造船业——是特别需要的。”
    从一九五二年十一月起，美国造船厂就没有接到过一次商船的订货。建造船只的数目将从一九五三年的五十二艘减少到一九五五年的三艘，而工人的数目则从好几万人减少到一千人。
    在纺织业中，特别是在毛织品的生产部门内的危机情况，也是同样尖锐的。在美国报刊称为“不健康部门中最不健康的环节”的这个部门内，工人的数目，一九四九年十二月为十四万八千人，一九五三年十二月已减少到八万五千人，而一九五四年年中则减少到七万人了。
    然而，纺织业决不是最不健康的部门，大家知道，在一九四六年与一九五三年之间，美国无烟煤的开采量业已减少了百分之五十，并且还在继续减少中。烟煤的开采量，一九四七年为五亿七千二百万吨，一九五三年已减少到四亿一千一百万吨，而现在，全年的水平只有三亿三千六百万吨，比一九四七年低百分之四十一点三。这个工业部门工人的数目，一九四八年为四十四万二千人，一九五四年四月已减少到二十一万五千人，而且还在继续减少。
    据报刊报道说，一九五四年上半年，美国钢的熔铸量比一九五三年低百分之二十四点二。一九五四年七月底，钢铁业的开工率已低于上半年，而为百分之六十四点五了。熔铸量比一九五三年减少了百分之二十六点二。属于摩根公司系统的“美国钢铁公司”董事会的董事长费尔勒斯不久以前曾宣称：一九五四年七月一日，订货单中未履行的订货为四百万吨，一九五四年四月一日为五百万吨，而一九五三年七月一日却为八百万吨。
    铣铁和钢的熔铸量的减少，使铁矿的消费量也减少了。在一九五四年一月至七月间，经大湖运输的铁矿为三千二百万吨，而一九五三年同一时期内为五千万吨，同时，各企业中矿石的储存量竟大到这样的程度，以致二百七十五艘船中只有二百艘在航驶，而且在最近期间仍将有二十五艘运送矿石的船只停航。
    铁路部门和铁路机器制造部门对于钢的消费量正在急剧减少。一九五四年铁路的运输量已比一九五三年降低百分之十二至十四，而比一九五二年降低百分之二十至二十二。一九五四年上半年，铁路公司的总收入比一九五三年减少了百分之十三点五，而纯收入则减少了百分之四十六。订货单中未履行的车厢订货，一九五二年一月一日为十二万三千九百四十七个单位，到一九五四年六月一日，已减少到一万二千一百六十九个单位，订货单中机车的订货，从一九五一年一月一日的一千八百八十三，减少到一九五四年七月一日的一百二十四个单位了。一九五三年六月三十日，“美国钢铁铸造公司”（生产铁路设备的铸造品）订货单中的订货为五千万美元，到一九五四年六月三十日，则已减少到一千六百万美元了。
    在一九五四年一月至六月，“鲍尔温—莱马—机车公司”（制造铁路设备）接到的订货为四千七百七十万美元，而在一九五三年一月至六月间为一亿美元。接到的订货还不到装运量的一半，这必然会使生产进一步降低。
    农业设备生产部门的状况也并不比较好些。一九五四年六月中旬，“国际收割机公司”从它的制造农业机器的七个企业中解雇了四千八百工人，而在八月中旬，又解雇了八百工人。该公司在说明解雇的原因时曾指出：“在一九五四年年初，我们按照需求的水平规定了企业的开工率，当时，据我们看来，这种需求是可能的。许多个月里的需求也都符合了我们的期望。而现在，这种需求没有了，我们就不得不使我们的生产适合市场的需要，以便使制成品的储存不至有过分积压的现象。”
    汽车工业，特别是所谓小公司，也距离繁荣很远。这些小公司的状况很难说不是悲惨的。只要提一提下列数字就足以说明了：一九五四年一月至六月，“史蒂倍克”公司出售的轻便汽车比较一九五三年同一时期减少了百分之五十七，不久以前由
  “赫德逊”公司和“纳希”公司合并而成的“美国汽车”公司减少了百分之六十八，“派克”公司减少了百分之六十九，“凯塞·韦利斯”公司减少了百分之七十。但是，这些公司情况的恶化还是从一九五三年开始的。一九五四年出现的新现象是，第三大汽车公司——“克利斯勒公司”——也降到遭受灾难的“小公司”之列了。在这个时期内，“克利斯勒”公司出售汽车的数量减少了百分之四十六。总计起来，在半年中，卡车的生产量减少了百分之十三点五，轻便汽车的生产量减少了百分之十。同时，如果说一九五四年一月至五月的生产量比一九五三年同一时期的生产量降低了百分之七点五，那么在六月就降低了百分之十四，而在七月则降低了百分之十五点二。为要明确地了解这个部门的情况，只需看一下“史蒂倍克”公司的情况就够了。这家公司各个企业单位的汽车生产量差不多降低了百分之六十。工人的数目由二万三千人减少到一万人。从一九五四年二月一日至七月底，未被解雇的工人平均每周仅工作两天。如果在一九五三年夏季，“史蒂倍克”公司各个企业单位中的工人平均每周工作四十六小时，那么现在他们每周工作已不到二十小时。在已被解雇的一万三千工人之中，就有九千八百人的失业期间长到这样的程度，以致连领取失业津贴的权利都被剥夺了（在美国可以领取失业津贴的最大期限是二十六个星期）。该公司在南班特城的主要企业在一九五四年已过去的二十九个星期内有十个星期根本没有开工。公司方面强迫工人同意修改工资定额，并把它降低百分之十四。
    汽车生产量降低的远景也不能不影响到钢铁工业的状况。供应底特律地区各汽车企业用钢的“大湖钢铁公司”在七月间借口汽车公司存钢很多，而将生产钢的十七个平炉之中的五个平炉熄火。由于这种原因，该公司的企业负荷量由百分之六十九降低到百分之四十九点一。
    表面上看来，目前美国经济战线上没有变化，但是，在美国各个经济部门中，到处都正在发生着大批企业倒闭的现象。企业倒闭的威胁和倒闭本身却被利用来作为对付罢工运动、增加劳动强度和减低工资定额的工具。在工人比较有组织和工资定额比较高的地区内的企业首先倒闭。
    可以这样说，所有这些部门总计起来，还不是美国整个的经济。在一九三三年，参议院的一个委员会曾经利用过这种论据。当时曾有人问及一位就美国经济状况问题出席作证的金融巨头，是否曾发生过严重的失业现象、大银行的倒闭和农民的大规模破产等等情况，他对所有的问题都回答说：“是的，在一些个别地方”，“是的，在一些个别地区”。最后，这个作证人的无耻行为甚至引起了业已见惯了这一套的参议员的愤怒。
    有一个参议员喊道：“当然是在一些个别的地方！只不过这些个别地方的北部和加拿大相连，南部和墨西哥接壤，西临太平洋，东临大西洋，而这些个别的地方就叫做美国……。”
    艾森豪威尔的非常乐观的声明，未必能使工业生产的水平和铁路运输的水平提高，但是，这个声明对于那些在证券交易所看涨的人和那些利用容易的和廉价的贷款来进行建设而指望可以找到购买者的人来说，却是意外之财。
    而正是在这些方面，即便没有新的刺激，引起重大震动的“易燃物质”也是很多的。
                    ×　×　×
    为了证明美国经济好像已经“恢复了”起见，美国经济学家便引证下列的工业生产指数，这个生产指数（季节性的波动计算在内）已从一九五三年七月的一三七（一九四八——四九年为一百）降到一九五四年三月和四月的一二三，到五月、六月、七月停留在一二四的水平上。
    但是，无论怎样解释，这个数字只能说明工业生产量下降的为指数中所反映出来的那种程度的停顿。过去的几次危机的历史曾有过这种下降停顿的时期。如果一九二○——一九二一年和一九三七——一九三九年的危机特征是连续的和全面的，而同时是相对短时期的和跳跃式的下降，那么，一九二九——一九三三年的危机的特征，就恰恰是这样间间断断的，而且是比较严重的和持久的下降。
    当美国的生产水平比一九五三年下降了百分之九，现有五百万完全失业工人和一千万半失业工人，企业破产的现象大量增加，农业、采煤业、造船业、纺织业、钢铁业和汽车工业等部门中存在着危机的时候，美国经济学家、政论家和国会议员硬说美国经济业已“恢复”了，这未必是适当的。
    美国联邦储备局的经济学家可以随便把该局在上文所列举的指数、把七月份（一个月之中为百分之五点六）工业生产绝对量的急剧下降解释为暂时的和季节性的现象。同时，很显然，各工厂夏季停工时间的特别长和改换模型的时间也那样长以及许多其他情况，都被用来缩减生产，因此，自然而然地反映出日益发展的经济危机的影响的多样性。
