    The development process of New China's civil aviation enterprise is basically a process of re-establishment. The old civil aviation enterprise's twenty years of operation left us with only a few dilapidated airports. Over the past five years, New China's civil aviation enterprise has overcome many difficulties and begun to develop.

    In the year or so from 1950 to 1951, civil aviation employees restored 16 aircraft from the remains abandoned by the Kuomintang bandit gang at Shanghai Longhua Airport. To this day, they are still undertaking the same arduous transportation tasks in the skies of the motherland. In order to break the US imperialist conspiracy of "embargo" and "blockade," employees have self-made hundreds of parts and equipment whose effectiveness is no less than that of imported products. Recently, they have also modified some equipment to continue utilizing some of the existing US-made aircraft, saving the country approximately 40 to 50 billion yuan.

    New China's civil aviation is a cause of the people. It serves the needs of production, national defense, and the political, economic, and cultural life of the people. Since the opening of civil aviation on August 1, 1950, business has developed to a certain extent. The flight kilometers in 1953 increased by about four times compared to 1951. If we compare the first half of 1954 with the first half of 1951, the flight kilometers increased by about 6.3 times. New China's civil aviation enterprise has transported a large number of silkworm eggs, fish fry, industrial equipment, medical drugs, newspapers, and cultural reading materials to cities and villages in the border areas, serving the country's industrial and agricultural production with its rapid characteristics.

    New China's civil aviation enterprise has also established a variety of specialized flights, opening up new and vast areas for China's aviation industry to serve the national economy. Since 1952, civil aviation aircraft have begun to appear over the rich forest areas of the motherland, undertaking patrol missions for fire prevention and alarm. In some locust plague areas, civil aviation aircraft sprayed powder to kill locusts, with a kill rate of 98% to 100%. Recently, trial flights for aerial prospecting of mineral deposits have also been conducted, and certain achievements have been made. In addition, specialized flights such as aerial photography, aerial surveying, aerial fertilization, and aerial seeding are also being trialed one by one. New China's civil aviation enterprise also plans to construct airport stations and navigation aids. In the 1953 fiscal year, more than 70% of the Civil Aviation Administration's capital construction investment was for new construction.

    China's civil aviation enterprise is currently still in the establishment stage. It will grow stronger with the increasing development of China's socialist industrialization and play its due role in the cause of China's socialist industrialization.

    创办中的民用航空事业
    全国人民代表大会代表

    新中国民用航空事业的发展过程基本上是一个重新创办的过程，旧的民用航空事业二十年的经营结果，留给我们的只是很少几处破烂的机场。五年来，新中国的民用航空事业克服了许多困难，开始发展起来。
    在一九五零年到一九五一年这一年多的时间里，民航员工从国民党匪帮抛弃在上海龙华机场的飞机躯壳中修复了十六架飞机，至今它们还在祖国的天空担当着同样辛勤的运输任务。为了打破美帝国主义“禁运”、“封锁”的阴谋，员工们自制了数百种效能不亚于舶来品的零件和设备，最近又改装了一些设备，使现有的部分美制飞机继续得到利用，为国家节约资金约四、五百亿元。
    新中国的民用航空是人民的事业，它是为生产、为国防需要和人民的政治、经济、文化生活服务的。一九五零年八月一日民用航空开航以来，业务上已有一定的发展。一九五三年的飞行公里较一九五一年增加了约四倍。如以一九五四年上半年同一九五一年上半年比，飞行公里增加了约六点三倍。新中国的民用航空事业为边疆的城市和乡村输送了大批蚕种、鱼苗、工业器材、医疗药品、报纸和文化读物，以它的迅速的特点，为国家的工农业生产服务。
    新中国的民用航空事业还创办了多种多样的专业飞行，开辟了我国航空事业为国民经济服务的新的广阔园地。从一九五二年起，民航飞机开始出现在祖国富饶的林区上空，担任防火报警的巡逻任务。在若干蝗害地区，民航飞机喷粉杀蝗，杀伤率达到百分之九十八到百分之一百。最近，又试办了空中勘测矿藏的飞行，也获得一定的成绩。此外，航空摄影、航空测量、航空施肥、航空布种等专业飞行也都在逐一试办中，新中国的民用航空事业还有计划地进行了场站和助航设备的建设。一九五三年度民用航空局的基本建设投资，百分之七十以上是属于新建部分的。
    中国的民用航空事业目前还处在创办的阶段，它将随着我国社会主义工业化的日益发展而壮大起来，在我国社会主义工业化的事业中发挥应有的作用。
