The southwest side of the Soviet Exhibition Center outside Xizhimen in Beijing was a field of crops just a month ago. Now, a joint shopping center with rich Chinese characteristics has been built: each house has a green roof, green windows, and red window frames. After the opening of the Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements Exhibition, the shopping center will serve the audience.

The entrance of the joint shopping center is fourteen meters wide, and a large paifang (archway) will be erected here. The front row of the shopping center is a sales area for Soviet goods. After visiting the exhibition, people can buy various Soviet daily necessities, food, toys, and souvenirs here. They can also go to the International Bookstore to buy various books published in the Soviet Union. Inside, there are four tea rooms that can accommodate 700 people for tea and rest at the same time. The spacious courtyard will be landscaped. There is a food retail department in the shopping center, specializing in providing visitors with various snacks and fruits. In the middle of the shopping center, there is a tall and spacious economic canteen, which can provide meals for 700 people at the same time. In the southwest corner of the shopping center, there is also a Hui Muslim canteen. In addition, two book stalls will be built in the courtyard, and Xinhua Bookstore and the post office will provide the audience with books, newspapers, and magazines.

To the west of the joint shopping center, a new bus station is under construction. After a short rest in the shopping center, visitors can go to the bus station from the west gate (there is an information desk, a food retail department, and a mother-and-child waiting room), and take Bus No. 2 via Fuchengmen to Chaoyangmen; they can also take Bus No. 3 or No. 7 via Xizhimen to Chongwenmen; or they can take a newly opened route via Xizhimen to Qianmen.

    北京市兴建西郊商场
    北京市西直门外苏联展览馆的西南面路南，一个月前只是一片庄稼地，现在已兴建起一座富有中国色彩的联合商场：每一所屋子都是绿顶绿窗红窗格。苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会开幕以后，商场将为观众们服务。
    联合商场的进口处宽十四公尺，这里将竖立起一座大牌坊。商场的前排是苏联商品售卖处。人们在参观了展览会后，可以从这里买到各种苏联的日用品、食品、玩具以及各种纪念品；还可以到国际书店，购买苏联出版的各种书籍。里边设有四个茶室，可以供给七百人同时饮茶休息。宽大的院子内，将要进行绿化工作。商场内有食品零售部，专供应参观者以各种点心和水果。商场中部，设有一座高大宽敞的经济食堂，这里可在同一时期内供七百人进餐。在商场的西南角，还有回民食堂。此外，院内将建设两个书亭，由新华书店和邮局向观众们供应书籍和报张杂志。
    联合商场的西面，一个新的公共汽车站正在建筑中。参观者在商场内少憩后，就可从西门走到汽车站（这里有问询处、食品零售部和母子候车室），乘坐二路公共汽车经阜成门前往朝阳门；也可乘三路、七路公共汽车经西直门到达崇文门；还可乘新辟线路车经西直门到达前门。
