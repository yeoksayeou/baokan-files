After more than five months of planning and coercion by the U.S. aggressive bloc, the eight-nation conference to discuss the aggressive "Southeast Asia Treaty" will begin in Manila on September 6. According to available information, the eight-nation conference will discuss a draft treaty proposed by the United States. The full text of this draft has already been revealed in the Philippine "Manila Daily Bulletin."

The world, especially Asian public opinion, has more than once exposed the aggressive nature of this U.S.-led Southeast Asian military bloc, in which only three Asian countries have expressed their willingness to participate. Although some people who are drumming up support for the so-called "Southeast Asia Treaty" are still trying to make people believe that this American plan is to maintain the sovereignty and integrity of Southeast Asian countries, and is for peace, the U.S.-drafted "Southeast Asia Treaty" that has been revealed completely exposes these deceptive words and nakedly exposes the essence of this war group.

The U.S. draft shows that the so-called "Southeast Asia Treaty" group is entirely a war group dominated by colonial countries, the purpose of which is first to enslave the Asian people and threaten the peace of Southeast Asia and all of Asia. The draft stipulates that the contracting parties must "maintain and develop their respective and collective" armed forces. This is to force the people of Southeast Asian countries to arm themselves and drive them to serve the aggressive purposes of the United States, letting the United States use Asians to fight Asians. The U.S. aggressive bloc clearly foresees that this work of gathering cannon fodder will inevitably be resisted by the people of Southeast Asia. Therefore, the draft specifically stipulates that "jointly," with "lasting and effective" and "mutual assistance" methods, it will "prevent and suppress" so-called "subversive activities" within countries. In reality, it is to allow colonial countries, with direct U.S. participation, to infringe upon the sovereignty of Southeast Asian countries, interfere in their internal affairs, create coups in Southeast Asian countries as the United States has done in Latin America, promote the infamous McCarthyism in Southeast Asian countries, deprive Asian countries of all democracy and freedom, and suppress their resistance to the U.S. policy of enslavement.

In the U.S. aggressive bloc's aggression against Asia, the U.S. provides money and weapons, and Asian countries provide troops. This was announced by the Eisenhower administration as soon as it came to power, and now it has been concretized in the U.S. "Southeast Asia Treaty" draft. According to the provisions of the draft, the United States can use the armies of Southeast Asian countries at will, under any pretext, to carry out provocations and aggression in Asia, thereby pushing the Asian people into the abyss of war. As long as this group unanimously agrees that "any country or region" within the specified Southeast Asian region has experienced so-called "communist aggression," or as long as there is a so-called "threat in any way" to the contracting parties, this group will "take action." This sentence is reminiscent of Dulles' repeated clamoring for so-called "massive retaliation," and he said that this "massive retaliation" would be carried out at the time and place chosen by the United States, etc. The "Treaty" draft stipulates that this aggressive group will act in "any country or region" under the pretext of "threats in any way." This is to facilitate the United States in choosing the time, place, etc. Here, the U.S. aggressive bloc has stripped away all the disguises piled up with words about peace, and completely exposed its evil desires to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, infringe upon the territorial sovereignty of other countries, and launch new wars. At the same time as launching the Korean War, the U.S. aggressive bloc occupied China's Taiwan under the pretext of the so-called "communist threat," and expanded its interference in the Indochina War. This immediate historical fact fully illustrates the seriousness of the consequences that these provisions in the U.S. draft may bring and the great threat it poses to Asian peace.

The U.S. plan is not only to organize a war group that threatens Asian peace, but also to obstruct the peaceful coexistence between Asian countries. The U.S. draft stipulates that the contracting parties of the "Southeast Asia Treaty" must guarantee not to conclude any international agreements that conflict with this treaty. This provision is obviously a pair of shackles prepared for Southeast Asian countries in order to restrain their hands and feet and obstruct their efforts to seek collective peace in Asia. In this draft, the U.S. aggressive bloc also stated its attempt to draw more Asian countries into the Southeast Asia group and expand the area controlled by this group. This shows that the U.S. aggressive bloc is urgently trying to stifle the growing desire of the Asian people for peaceful coexistence and undermine the efforts made by the Asian people after the Geneva Conference to establish and expand a zone of peace.

The U.S. aggressive bloc in this "Southeast Asia Treaty" draft does not conceal its attempt to undermine peace in Indochina. It openly places Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnam under the "protection" of the Southeast Asian military bloc. This is actually to undermine the collective guarantee of the countries participating in the Geneva Conference for peace in Indochina and for the unity, independence, and sovereignty of the countries of Indochina, to undermine the Geneva Conference agreements, and to turn Indochina into a military base for the United States to engage in aggression. The ulterior motives of the United States in refusing to participate in the common guarantee of peace in Indochina at the Geneva Conference have now been fully exposed.

The U.S. plan openly states that the goal of the Southeast Asia military bloc is to deal with the "communists," which is first and foremost to deal with the 600 million Chinese people. This clearly illustrates the nature of the Southeast Asia military bloc as hostile to the Chinese people. In fact, the U.S. aggressive bloc has never wanted to hide this. The New York "Daily Mirror" openly admitted that the organization of the Southeast Asia group was "to deal with Communist China and form an alliance against Communist China."

It can be clearly seen that this "Southeast Asia Treaty," whether in its wording or in its essence, is exactly the same as the aggressive treaties such as the "North Atlantic Treaty" and the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand "Three-Nation Security Treaty" produced by the U.S. aggressive bloc. The difference is that the "Southeast Asia Treaty" is aimed at the Asian people, to undermine and obstruct the peaceful coexistence between Asian countries, to incite war in Asia, and to create tension. It is completely contrary to the interests of Asian countries and people, as well as the interests of peace-loving people all over the world. It is another brutal violation by the U.S. aggressive bloc of the principles of promoting international cooperation and guaranteeing peace and international security stipulated in the United Nations Charter. Some countries, while expressing their advocacy of peaceful coexistence, are following the United States to engage in such an aggressive group. They themselves cannot explain this contradictory position. There is no doubt that the awakened Asian people will never allow the barbarous colonialists of the United States to manipulate their destiny. The Asian people will resolutely oppose the Southeast Asian military bloc created by the United States and use all their strength to thwart any conspiracy to enslave the Asian people.

### 美国拟订的“东南亚公约”草案的实质

    美国拟订的“东南亚公约”草案的实质
    新华社评论员　江南
    经过美国侵略集团五个多月的策划拉拢之后，讨论侵略性的“东南亚公约”的八国会议，将于九月六日在马尼拉开始举行。根据已有的消息，八国会议将讨论美国所提出的一份公约草案。这份草案的全文已经在菲律宾的“马尼拉导报”上透露了出来。
    关于这个只有三个亚洲国家表示愿意参加的以美国为首的东南亚军事集团，全世界、特别是亚洲的公众舆论已经不止一次地揭露了它的侵略性质。尽管某些替所谓“东南亚公约”摇旗呐喊的人还在竭力企图使人相信美国的这个计划是为了保持东南亚国家的主权完整的，是为了和平的。但是已经透露出来的美国拟订的“东南亚公约”草案，却完全揭穿了这些欺人之谈，赤裸裸地暴露了这个战争集团的实质。
    美国的草案说明，所谓“东南亚公约”集团完全是一个以殖民国家为主的战争集团，其目的首先是为了奴役亚洲人民，威胁东南亚及全亚洲的和平。草案规定，缔约国必须“维持并发展它们各别的与集体的”武装力量，这就是要将东南亚国家的人民强迫武装起来，并驱使他们为美国的侵略目的服务，让美国用亚洲人打亚洲人。美国侵略集团显然预见到这种搜罗炮灰的工作必然要遭到东南亚人民的反抗，因此在草案中特地规定了要“共同地”以“持久的、有效的”以及“互助的”办法，来“防止和镇压”各国国内的所谓“颠覆活动”，实际上就是要在美国直接参与之下，由殖民国家来侵犯东南亚各国的主权，干涉他们的内政，像美国在拉丁美洲所作的一样在东南亚国家制造政变，在东南亚国家内推行臭名远扬的麦卡锡主义，剥夺亚洲国家的一切民主和自由，镇压他们对于美国的奴役政策的反抗。
    在美国侵略集团对亚洲进行的侵略中，由美国提供金钱和武器，由亚洲国家提供军队，这是艾森豪威尔政府一上台就宣布过了的，现在在美国的
  “东南亚公约”草案里就这样具体化了。根据草案的规定，美国可以利用东南亚国家的军队，随心所欲，以任何借口在亚洲进行挑衅和侵略，从而把亚洲人民推进战争的深渊。只要这个集团一致同意指明的东南亚区域内“任何国家或地区”发生了所谓
  “共产党侵略”，只要对缔约国存在所谓“任何方式的威胁”，这个集团就要“采取行动”。这句话令人想到杜勒斯多次叫嚣的什么“大规模报复”，他并说这种“大规模报复”要在美国选择的时间、地点等等来进行。“公约”草案规定这个侵略集团要在“任何国家或地区”借口“任何方式的威胁”来行动。这就是为了给美国选择时间、地点等等的方便。美国侵略集团在这里剥光了一切用关于和平的言词堆砌起来的伪装，彻底地暴露了它对于干涉别国内政、侵犯别国领土主权发动新战争的邪恶欲望。美国侵略集团在发动朝鲜战争的同时，就曾以所谓“共产主义的威胁”为借口，侵占了中国的台湾，并扩大对印度支那战争的干涉。这个近在眼前的历史事实，充分说明了美国草案中的这些规定可能带来的后果的严重性和它对于亚洲和平的巨大威胁。
    美国的计划不但要组织一个威胁亚洲和平的战争集团，而且要阻挠亚洲国家之间的和平共处。美国的草案中规定，“东南亚公约”的缔约国要保证不缔结同本条约抵触的任何国际协定。这项规定显然是为东南亚国家准备下的一副镣铐，以便束缚它们的手脚，阻挠它们觅致亚洲集体和平的努力。美国侵略集团在这个草案中还表明它企图把更多的亚洲国家拉进东南亚集团，并扩大这个集团所控制的地区。这说明美国侵略集团正在迫不急待地力图扼杀亚洲人民的日益增涨的和平共处的愿望，破坏亚洲人民在日内瓦会议以后为建立并扩大和平地区而作的努力。
    美国侵略集团在这个“东南亚公约”草案中毫不掩饰地表明它企图破坏印度支那的和平。它公然把老挝、柬埔寨和越南南部置于东南亚军事集团的
  “保护”之下。这实际上就是要破坏日内瓦会议各国对印度支那和平以及印度支那各国的统一、独立和主权的集体保证，破坏日内瓦会议的协议，把印度支那变成美国从事侵略的军事基地。美国在日内瓦会议上拒绝参加对印度支那和平的共同保证的见不得人的动机，现在已经完全暴露了。
    美国的计划公开表明东南亚军事集团的目标就是要对付“共产党”，也就是首先要对付六亿中国人民。这清楚地说明了东南亚军事集团敌视中国人民的性质。事实上，美国侵略集团从来不想掩饰这一点。纽约“每日镜报”公开承认过，组织东南亚集团就是“为了对付共产党中国，并组成一个反对共产党中国的联盟”。
    可以看得很清楚，这个“东南亚公约”无论在文字形式上和实质上，和美国侵略集团监制的“北大西洋公约”、美、澳、新“三国安全公约”等侵略性的条约是一模一样的东西。不同的是：“东南亚公约”是针对着亚洲人民的，是为了破坏和阻挠亚洲各国之间的和平共处，在亚洲煽动战争，制造紧张局势。它是完全违反亚洲国家和人民的利益以及全世界爱好和平人民的利益的。它是美国侵略集团对于联合国宪章规定的促进国际合作、保障和平与国际安全的原则的又一次粗暴的破坏。有些国家一面表示主张和平共处，一面却跟着美国来搞这样的侵略集团，这种自相矛盾的立场他们自己是无论如何也解说不过去的。毫无疑问，觉醒了的亚洲人民绝对不会听任美国野蛮的殖民主义者摆布他们的命运。亚洲人民将要坚决反对美国制造的东南亚军事集团，并以一切力量来挫败任何企图奴役亚洲人民的阴谋。（新华社六日讯）
