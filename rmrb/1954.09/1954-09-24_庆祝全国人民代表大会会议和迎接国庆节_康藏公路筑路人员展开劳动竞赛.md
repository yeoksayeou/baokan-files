Xinhua News Agency, Changdu, September 22nd: To celebrate the convocation of the First Session of the First National People's Congress and welcome the advent of National Day, the Kangzang Highway construction workers are using new labor achievements. On the construction line, which is more than 200 miles long, thousands of people are working even on rainy days and Sundays; the blasting fires and construction site lights at night illuminate the rushing river; the entire construction area constitutes a magnificent picture. Thousands of soldiers and workers are enthusiastically launching labor competitions, striving to complete the construction of the most arduous section of this year, which is more than 210 kilometers long, before September 25th. While working, people excitedly talk about: This year, the motherland has great victories and many happy events, we must use new labor achievements to congratulate the motherland.

    Cadres and soldiers of a certain unit have universally participated in the "Patriotic Construction of Tibet" merit campaign since the beginning of September. In the first half of the month, their average work efficiency reached 144 percent of the standard quota. The soldiers who have been fighting on the dangerous cliffs of the Boqu River for more than a month, with the support of mechanical workers, decided to complete the task of more than 40,000 cubic meters of stone work by September 23rd, two days ahead of the original opening date, as a gift to National Day. On the night shift construction site, Regiment Chief of Staff Gong Xuesan and Company Commander Li Runsheng told reporters: For four consecutive years, we have completed the road and bridge construction tasks ahead of National Day. This year the task is heavier, and it is completed the fastest. The mechanical road construction workers who are working here, without waiting for a bridge of more than 200 meters long to be built, with the help of bridge builders, slipped cars and machines over from the steel cable to work side by side with the soldiers who were splitting stone cliffs, and increased the perforation efficiency by 10 percent.

    The soldiers of a certain unit entering the new construction area, some repaired the wooden cages of the protective roadbed in the water, and some were clearing the mud, sand, and rocks falling from the high mountains, and decided to complete all the 13-kilometer roadbed one week before National Day. On the last section of the construction area, which is expected to be opened to traffic on September 25th, the workers have already carried hundreds of thousands of kilograms of grain and materials forward for one to two hundred miles, and used logging machines and manpower to clear a large number of trees and stones from the line. They have generally exceeded the standard work efficiency, and the workers are confident to ensure that cars will pass through the roads they have built on September 25th to welcome the National Day of the great motherland.

    Xinhua News Agency, Changdu, September 23rd: All the road construction personnel who built the Kangzang Highway wrote a letter to the First National People's Congress, guaranteeing to the congress that the highway would be built to Lhasa by the end of this year. The letter said: Dear representatives, in these joyful days of victory after victory, we report to you another good news: we guarantee to build the highway to Lhasa by the end of this year. We are determined to use this practical action as a gift to the second year of my country's first five-year plan to support the liberation of Taiwan; and use this as a gift to the First National People's Congress. In the past few years, we have encountered all kinds of difficulties, but whenever we think of the great Chairman Mao’s instructions to us, “To help all fraternal nationalities, do not be afraid of difficulties, and work hard to build roads!” the difficulties seem small. This year we encountered rare difficulties in the Bomi area, and we have carried out many struggles with floods and landslides, and now we have tamed them under our feet. When the landslide was the most serious, dozens of places with thousands and tens of thousands of cubic meters of landslides pressed on the roadbed in one day. As soon as one section was cleared, another section collapsed. At that time, we made up our minds and encouraged each other: even if a mountain collapses, it is not allowed to block the road from moving forward.

    On the road to Lhasa in the west, we will encounter many difficulties. We are always ready to fight any difficulties and we must overcome them. We know that the more soil we dig and the more stones we move, the faster my country's socialist society will come; the more sweat we shed and the more hardship we endure, the more happiness the Tibetan people will add; the sooner the highway is built to Lhasa, the sooner the Tibetan people will have a happier life. We will definitely live up to the entrustment of the people of the whole country and definitely make the ideals of the Kangzang people a reality.

    庆祝全国人民代表大会会议和迎接国庆节
    康藏公路筑路人员展开劳动竞赛
    【新华社昌都二十二日电】康藏公路筑路人员正以新的劳动成就来庆祝第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的召开和迎接国庆节的来临。在二百多里长的施工线上，落雨天和星期日也有成千上万的人在作工；夜里的开山炮火和工地灯光照亮着奔腾的河水；整个工区构成一幅壮丽的图景。成千上万的战士和工人热烈地展开劳动竞赛，争取在九月二十五日以前把今年最艰巨的全长二百一十多公里的施工地段修通。人们一边工作一边兴奋地谈论着：今年祖国的胜利大、喜事多，我们要用新的劳动成就来向祖国祝贺。
    某部干部、战士们，从九月初普遍参加“爱国建藏”立功运动，他们在上半月的施工中平均工效达到标准定额的百分之一百四十四。在波曲河南险崖上战斗了一个多月的战士们，得到机械工人支援后，决定在九月二十三日完成四万多方石方工程的任务，比原订通车时间再提前两天，作为向国庆节的献礼。在夜班工地上，团参谋长宫血三和连长李润生告诉记者说：我们连着四年都在国庆节前提前完成了筑路架桥任务，今年任务更重，完成得也最快。正在这里工作的机械筑路工人，没等一座二百多公尺长的大桥架好，就由架桥工人帮助把汽车和机器从钢索上溜了过来，到这里和劈石崖的战士并肩工作，并把穿孔工效提高了百分之十。
    进入新工区的某部战士们，有的下水修好了防护路基的木笼，有的正在清除着从高山上落下来的泥沙，乱石，决定在国庆节前一星期把十三公里路基全部修通。在到预计九月二十五日通车的最后一段工区上，工人们已经把几十万斤的粮食、料具向前背运了一百到二百里，并用伐木机和人工从线路上清除了大量树木和石头。他们普遍都超过了标准工效，工人们有信心保证在九月二十五日让汽车从他们修筑的路上通过，来迎接伟大祖国的国庆节。
    【新华社昌都二十三日电】修建康藏公路的全体筑路人员，写信给第一届全国人民代表大会，向大会保证在今年年底把公路修到拉萨。信上说：亲爱的代表们，在这些胜利接着胜利的欢乐日子里，再向你们报告一个喜讯：我们保证在今年年底把公路修到拉萨。我们决心用这一实际行动，作为对我国第一个五年计划第二年度的献礼，支援解放台湾；并以此作为向第一届全国人民代表大会的献礼。几年来，我们碰到过各式各样的困难，但是，每当我们想到伟大的毛主席给我们的“为了帮助各兄弟民族，不怕困难，努力筑路！”的指示时，困难就显得渺小了。今年我们在波密区碰到了历年来少有的困难，我们接连和洪水、塌方进行了多次斗争，现在已经把它们驯服在脚下。在塌方最严重的时候，一天内就有几十处上千上万方的塌方压到路基上，刚刚清除了一处，另一段上又垮了下来。当时我们下定决心，互相鼓励：就是一座山垮下来，也不准它阻挡公路前进。
    在西通拉萨的前进道路上，我们还会碰到很多困难，我们随时准备跟任何困难作斗争，而且要一定战胜它。我们知道：我们多挖一锹土，多搬一块石头，我国的社会主义社会就会来得快一点；我们多流一滴汗，多吃一分苦，藏族人民就多添一分福；把公路早一天修到拉萨，藏族人民更加幸福的日子就会早一天到来。我们一定不辜负全国人民对我们的嘱托，一定使康藏人民的理想变成现实。
