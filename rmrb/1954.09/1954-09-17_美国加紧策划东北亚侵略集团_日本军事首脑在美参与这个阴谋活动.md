Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: According to reports from the "Mainichi Shimbun" correspondent in Washington, the Chairman of the Joint Staff Council of Japan, Keizo Hayashi, who is currently visiting the United States, and U.S. military leaders such as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Radford, discussed the establishment of a Northeast Asia military group. This reporter revealed that Hayashi's visit to the U.S. and the recent activities in Washington of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang remnant from Taiwan and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of South Korea, Lee Hyung-geun, are "closely related." The reporter quoted well-informed U.S. military sources as saying, "Because a collective defense organization has already been established in the Southeast Asia region," the U.S. government hopes to conclude a Northeast Asia treaty as soon as possible.

Hayashi also discussed the issue of "joint military operations" between the U.S. and Japan with the U.S. military. He requested the U.S. to supply Japan with a large number of jet aircraft and destroyers as a condition for Japan's expansion of its military.

    【新华社十六日讯】东京消息：据“每日新闻”驻华盛顿记者报道，正在美国访问的日本幕僚长（参谋长）联席会议主席林敬三和美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福等军事领袖讨论了建立东北亚军事集团的问题。这个记者透露，林敬三的访美和最近台湾蒋介石残匪以及南朝鲜的参谋长联席会议主席李亨根在华盛顿的活动“有密切关系”。记者引消息灵通的美国军方人士的话说：“因为东南亚地区已经建立了集体防御组织”，美国政府很希望尽早缔结东北亚条约。
    林敬三还和美国军方商谈了美国和日本之间的
  “联合军事行动”问题。他要求美国供给日本大量喷气飞机和驱逐舰，作为日本扩充军队的条件。
