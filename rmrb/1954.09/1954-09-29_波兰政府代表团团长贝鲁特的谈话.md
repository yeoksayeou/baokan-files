Dear Comrades and Friends!
　　The delegation of the People's Republic of Poland is delighted to come to the capital of your great and beautiful country to convey the warm friendship of the Polish people to you.
　　On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of China's liberation, we would like to celebrate with the Chinese people. We will never forget that the revolutionary achievements, self-sacrificing spirit, and infinite strength of our brotherly nation, the heroic great Soviet people, are the source of the liberation of our people ten years ago and the liberation of your people five years ago. Today, all good people in Asia and Europe and on the continent clearly recognize that for the happiness of the common people of the world, the countries in our camp are closely united and ardently eager for peace, eager for peaceful construction. The invincible strength that the dark forces of aggression, greed, and destruction can never overcome lies in this.
　　Warmly congratulate you and sincerely hope that your National Day holiday will become a great contribution to the cause of striving for the happiness of the great Chinese people, for the freedom of the Asian people, and for the struggle for lasting peace in the world.
　　Long live the prosperity of the People's Republic of China!

    波兰政府代表团团长贝鲁特的谈话亲爱的同志们和朋友们！
    波兰人民共和国代表团愉快地来到你们这伟大美好国度的首都，以传达波兰人民对你们的热烈的友情。
    值此中国解放五周年之际，我们愿和中国人民共同欢庆。我们永远不会忘记，我们的兄弟民族、英勇的伟大苏联人民已取得的革命成果、自我牺牲的精神和无穷的力量，就是十年前我国人民的解放和五年前贵国人民的解放的源泉。今天，欧亚两洲及大陆上所有的善良人们都清楚地认识到为了世界普通人民的幸福，我们阵营的各个国家都紧密地团结一致热烈地渴望和平，渴望和平建设。侵略、贪婪和破坏的黑暗势力所永不能克服的不可战胜的力量就在于此。
    热烈地祝贺你们并衷心地希望你们的国庆节日能成为对争取伟大中国人民的幸福、争取亚洲各国人民的自由、争取全世界持久和平的斗争事业的伟大贡献。
    中华人民共和国繁荣万岁！
