    The "Provisional Regulations on Joint State-Private Industrial Enterprises," promulgated today by the State Council of the Central People's Government, were formulated based on the requirements of the state's general task during the transition period and the experience of joint state-private enterprises over the past few years. With these regulations as the standard for joint state-private industry, they will play a significant role in further promoting the transformation of capitalist industry and actively developing joint state-private enterprises.
    Gradually transforming capitalist industry into joint state-private industry is an important historical task for the state during the transition period. The socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce by the state during the transition period is carried out in two steps: first, basically bringing capitalist industry and commerce into the orbit of state capitalism; second, transforming state capitalism into socialism. In recent years, due to the state's correct implementation of the policy of utilization, restriction, and transformation of the capitalist economy, the vast majority of capitalist industry has been brought into various forms of state capitalism, with the intermediate form of state capitalism, namely processing, ordering, unified purchasing, and exclusive sales, occupying the main position. According to statistics, in the first quarter of 1954, the output value of state processing, ordering, unified purchasing, and exclusive sales accounted for 86.4 percent of the total output value of private large-scale industries in eight major cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, and Xi'an. Although this is not yet the advanced form of state capitalism, the socialist and capitalist components have already established some degree of connection outside the enterprise, strengthening the leading position of the socialist economy, restricting the destructive role of the capitalist economy, and initially bringing capitalist industry into the orbit of state planning, thereby promoting the development of production and creating conditions for the further transformation of these enterprises.
    However, it is clearly not enough to stop the transformation of capitalist industry at the stage of processing and ordering. Because under the intermediate form of state capitalism, the enterprise is still owned by the capitalist, the production is still the responsibility of the capitalist, and the enterprise is still managed in a capitalist manner. In this way, the public-private contradictions and labor-capital contradictions in the enterprise, and the many contradictions arising therefrom, cannot be effectively resolved, which also limits the education and transformation of capitalists and their agents. At present, many enterprises, although they have accepted processing and ordering, do not comply with public-private contracts and fail to complete tasks on time, with quality, and in quantity. Furthermore, due to the fact that the old relations of production cannot adapt to the development of the productive forces, and due to the development of the contradiction between the blindness of production and the state's planned construction, it is already difficult for these enterprises to continue to expand production to meet the growing needs of the state and the people. This requires guiding these enterprises from the intermediate form of state capitalism to the advanced form of state capitalism, further changing the relations of production, so that the productive forces can be developed, increasing output, improving quality, reducing costs, and supplying the growing needs of the state and the people.
    The advanced form of state capitalism is the joint state-private enterprise. It is the cooperation between socialist and capitalist components within the enterprise, with the socialist component occupying the leading position, a semi-socialist enterprise. This facilitates the transformation of the original enterprise according to the management policies and principles of socialist enterprises, and is also conducive to the education and transformation of bourgeois elements. Transforming private enterprises and transforming bourgeois elements are two aspects of a whole in the state's socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. These two aspects of work are interrelated and mutually influential. Only by doing a good job in both the transformation of enterprises and the transformation of people can the task of socialist transformation be completed. In joint state-private enterprises, because capitalists and their agents can receive the leadership of public representatives and the help and supervision of the masses of workers, this is most conducive to doing a good job in the transformation of enterprises and the transformation of people, and is most convenient for preparing conditions to transform state capitalism into socialist enterprises in a calm and appropriate manner. As long as the work of joint state-private operation is done well, the leading position and leading role of the socialist component are established in the joint state-private enterprise, the operation and management of the enterprise are continuously improved and transformed, the technology is appropriately improved, the production potential is better utilized, the awareness and organization of the masses of workers are continuously improved, and the capitalists and their agents are regularly educated and helped to transform, then the necessary conditions can be created to finally complete the socialist transformation of capitalist industry.
    Facts have proven that joint state-private enterprises have great advantages over enterprises in the intermediate form of state capitalism. In the first half of this year, 60 factories in Shanghai were transformed into joint state-private enterprises. In most of these factories, enterprise management was improved in the first quarter or the first month after the joint state-private operation, and the enthusiasm of the workers was unprecedentedly high, and new prospects appeared in production. Before the joint state-private operation, Datong Iron Factory once manufactured 160 hexagonal lathes for the state, and delivered them five months late, which affected the production of several factories. After being reorganized into a joint state-private enterprise in February of this year, it was able to complete production tasks on time, and the second quarter's production plan was completed ahead of schedule on June 25, with product quality fully meeting specifications. Such changes are even more significant in the 57 factories that implemented joint state-private operation before this year. Many of these factories have expanded or built new factory buildings, increased machinery and equipment, and increased output. The China Shipbuilding Factory has only been a joint state-private enterprise for two years, and it has developed from a dilapidated small repair shipyard into a larger shipyard. The factory buildings and machines have increased by two times compared with before the joint state-private operation, and the number of workers has increased by six times. The planned total output value this year is six times greater than the total output value in 1952. Zhongxi Pharmacy began joint state-private operation in 1950, changed its business policy and reorganized its production. By 1951, its turnover had increased by two times compared with 1950. In 1953, the production of medicines was seven times that of 1950, and the cost was also reduced by one-half. Since 1951, it has reversed the past situation of losses, private shareholders have received dividends, and the enterprise has also proposed a public accumulation fund of 1 billion yuan every year to build new factories. More than 100 joint state-private factories in the city have also generally improved labor hygiene conditions. Xinyi Yarn Factory, which implemented joint state-private operation in 1950, used more than 10 billion yuan to improve the temperature and humidity, dust removal, lighting and other labor protection facilities in each workshop. Now all four main workshops in the factory are equipped with cold air cooling equipment. After the factories improved labor hygiene conditions, work-related accidents and diseases were significantly reduced. After the Xin'an Electric Motor Factory was jointly operated by the state and private sectors in February of this year, the number of work-related accidents in the second quarter was reduced by half compared with the previous quarter. There are now more than 40 factories in Tianjin that have implemented joint state-private operation. Among them, after the Yongming Paint Industry Company was jointly operated, its output and profits have increased by two times, labor productivity has increased by one and a half times, costs have been reduced by 6 percent, and private dividend dividends have increased by more than one time compared with before the joint operation. The situation in other joint operation factories is also roughly the same. There are many such examples in various places.
    However, there are still very few joint state-private enterprises today. According to statistics in 1953, only about 12 percent of the country's capitalist industry, calculated by output value, had implemented joint state-private operation. The development of joint state-private operation is also a very complex task, involving the relations between the public, private, labor, and capital sectors. Therefore, on the one hand, we must actively develop joint state-private operation and increase the number of joint state-private enterprises, and on the other hand, we must adopt a steady and progressive approach to prevent various deviations. That is to say, it should be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner according to the needs of the country, the possibility of enterprise transformation, and the principle of voluntary participation by capitalists. Educating capitalists before or after joint operation is very important.
    At present, due to the increasing prominence of the advantages of joint state-private operation, and due to the publicity of the general task of the transition period, more and more capitalists are applying for joint state-private operation, but many capitalists still reflect varying degrees of apprehension. This requires explaining to them widely and deeply the necessity of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, explaining the specific policies of the people's government on the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and increasing the enthusiasm of capitalists for implementing joint state-private operation. For capitalists who insist on resisting with various illegal acts, it is necessary to distinguish between different natures and degrees, and give them criticism, education and appropriate treatment separately. Those who have serious destructive behavior should be punished.
    In joint state-private enterprises, the socialist component and public representatives must occupy a leading position in the enterprise, while the capitalist component and private sector are in a subordinate position. The leading position of the socialist component in the enterprise does not depend on the proportion of state investment in individual enterprises, but on the nature of the state power, the leading position of the socialist economy in the national economy, the combination of public representatives and the masses of workers, and the education and transformation of capitalists and their agents. It depends on whether this leadership can effectively promote the progress of the enterprise. Under this premise, the legitimate rights and interests of private shares must also be recognized so that the legitimate rights and interests of private shares are protected. Some cadres have not clearly understood the nature of joint state-private enterprises, and therefore have either "rightist" or "leftist" tendencies in enterprise leadership, such as abandoning leadership or neglecting the legitimate rights and interests of private shares. This tendency should be corrected quickly.
    After the implementation of joint state-private operation of enterprises, it provides the possibility for giving play to the superiority of the socialist component in the enterprise and its leading position and leading role in the enterprise. However, much arduous work must be done before this possibility can become a reality. One of the main tasks is to reform the old management system and promote the advanced socialist management system. However, when carrying out reforms, we must proceed steadily and not be impetuous. The enterprise's wage, welfare, bonus, and other systems should be gradually improved with reference to the original foundation and production and operation situation of the joint venture enterprise, and with reference to the relevant regulations of state-owned enterprises, and gradually brought into line with comparable state-owned enterprises. Reforming the old management system is the process of struggle between socialist management thinking and capitalist management thinking, and is the process of socialist management system gradually replacing capitalist management system. Therefore, we must rely on the awareness and organization of the workers, implement the system of workers' representatives participating in enterprise management, and extensively mobilize them to exercise the right of supervision. The capitalist management thinking of capitalists and their agents must be patiently criticized and educated through regular public-private consultations and democratic discussions, and guided and helped to gradually correct it.
    Private representatives have certain positions in the administrative positions of joint state-private enterprises. Under the leadership of the public sector, they should have both position and power. Of course, they must also perform their duties and responsibilities and must not engage in corruption. For the original substantive personnel of the enterprise, they should be employed according to their original situation, making the best use of their talents, becoming enterprise cadres, and giving them full opportunities to contribute their management or technical talents. For the original substantive personnel who have made contributions to the enterprise but have lost their ability to work, appropriate care should be given. For the actual property of the enterprise, it should be valued through consultation between the public and private sectors according to the principles of fairness and reasonableness. For the distribution of the surplus of joint state-private enterprises, in addition to paying income tax in accordance with the law, it should be reasonably allocated in terms of the enterprise's public accumulation fund, enterprise bonus fund, and shareholder dividends and bonuses.
    The current situation is conducive to the active development of joint state-private enterprises. However, it must also be noted that this is a complex and arduous task. In order to do this work well, we must resolutely implement the central government's various policies, correctly use the state's power and laws, unify the steps of various relevant departments of the financial and economic system, rely on the awareness and organization of the masses of workers, and strengthen the education and transformation of capitalists. As long as we do these tasks well, the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and the development of joint state-private operations will surely achieve good results.

    把有利于国计民生的资本主义工业有步骤地改变为公私合营工业
    中央人民政府政务院今天公布的“公私合营工业企业暂行条例”，是根据国家过渡时期总任务的要求和几年来公私合营企业的经验制订的。有了这个条例作为公私合营工业的准则，对进一步推动资本主义工业的改造，积极发展公私合营企业，将起着重大的作用。
    把资本主义工业有步骤地改变为公私合营工业，是国家在过渡时期的重要历史任务。国家在过渡时期对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，分两个步骤进行：第一步，将资本主义工商业基本上纳入国家资本主义轨道；第二步，将国家资本主义改变为社会主义。几年来，由于国家正确地执行了对资本主义经济的利用、限制和改造的政策，资本主义工业的绝大部分，已经纳入了各种形式的国家资本主义的轨道，其中又以国家资本主义的中级形式，即加工订货统购包销占主要地位。据统计，北京、天津、沈阳、上海、武汉、广州、重庆、西安等八大城市的私营大型工业一九五四年第一季度总产值中，国家加工、订货、统购、包销的产值占百分之八十六点四。这虽然还不是国家资本主义的高级形式，但是社会主义成分和资本主义成分在企业外部已有了某种程度的联系，加强了社会主义经济的领导地位，限制了资本主义经济的破坏作用，把资本主义工业初步纳入了国家计划的轨道，因而促进了生产的发展，也为这些企业的进一步改造创造了条件。
    但对资本主义工业的改造如果停留在加工、订货的阶段上显然是不够的。因为在国家资本主义的中级形式之下，企业仍为资本家所有，生产仍由资本家负责，企业还是按照资本主义方式管理，这样，企业中公私矛盾和劳资矛盾及由此而产生的许多矛盾就不能获得有效的解决，也限制了对资本家及资本家代理人的教育和改造。目前有不少企业虽已接受了加工、订货，但不遵守公私合同，没有按期、按质、按量完成任务；并且由于旧的生产关系不能适应生产力的发展，由于生产的盲目性与国家计划建设的矛盾的发展，要这些企业继续扩大生产，以适应国家和人民日益增长的需要，已有困难。这就要求把这些企业由国家资本主义中级形式引向国家资本主义高级形式，进一步改变生产关系，使生产力得到发展，增加产量，提高质量，降低成本，供应日益增长的国家和人民的需要。
    国家资本主义的高级形式是公私合营企业。它是社会主义成分和资本主义成分在企业内部进行合作，社会主义成分居于领导地位，半社会主义性质的企业，这就便于按照社会主义性质企业的经营方针和管理原则来改造原有企业，也有利于对资产阶级分子的教育和改造。改造私营企业和改造资产阶级分子，是国家对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造一个整体的两方面。这两方面的工作是互相关联与互相影响的。只有同时做好企业的改造和人的改造，才能完成社会主义改造的任务。在公私合营企业中，由于资本家及资本家代理人能够得到公股代表的领导，得到职工群众的帮助与监督，这就最有利于做好企业的改造和人的改造工作，最便于准备条件，从容地和妥善地变国家资本主义为社会主义的企业。只要公私合营工作作得好，在公私合营企业中确立了社会主义成分的领导地位和领导作用，不断地改善和改造企业的经营管理，适当地改进技术，更好地发挥生产潜力，不断地提高职工群众的觉悟性和组织性，并经常地对资本家和资本家代理人进行教育和帮助其改造，这就能够造成必要的条件，最后完成资本主义工业的社会主义改造。
    事实证明，公私合营企业比国家资本主义的中级形式的企业有很大的优越性。上海市今年上半年有六十家工厂改为公私合营，其中大多数厂在公私合营后的第一季度或第一个月，企业管理就有了改进，职工的积极性也空前高涨，在生产上就出现了新的气象。大同铁工厂在公私合营前，一次为国家制造一百六十部六角车床，过期五个月才交货，影响了若干工厂的生产。今年二月改组为公私合营企业后，都能按期完成生产任务，第二季度的生产计划提早在六月二十五日就完成了，产品质量完全合乎规格。在今年以前实行公私合营的五十七家工厂中，这种变化更是显著，其中许多工厂都扩建或新建了厂房，增加了机器设备和提高了产量。中华造船厂公私合营才两年，就已从一个破烂的小修船厂发展成为一个规模较大的造船厂，厂房和机器比公私合营前增加了两倍，工人增加了六倍，今年计划中的生产总值比一九五二年的生产总值大六倍。中西药房一九五○年开始公私合营，改变了经营方针并重新组织了生产，到一九五一年，营业额比一九五○年增加两倍；一九五三年药品的生产量为一九五○年的七倍，成本也降低了二分之一；从一九五一年起，就扭转了过去亏本的局面，私股股东分到了股息，企业还每年提出公积金十亿元，建造了新工厂。全市一百多个公私合营工厂还普遍改进了劳动卫生条件。一九五○年实行公私合营的信和纱厂，用一百多亿元资金改进了各车间温湿度、吸尘、照明和其他劳动保护设施，现在全厂四个主要车间都安装了冷风降温设备。各工厂在改进劳动卫生条件后，工伤事故和疾病显著减少。新安电机厂今年二月公私合营后，第二季度的工伤事故比前一季度减少了一半。天津市现已有四十多家工厂实行了公私合营，其中永明油漆工业公司合营后，产量、利润却都增加了两倍，劳动生产率提高了一倍半，成本降低了百分之六，私股分红比合营前增加了一倍多。其他合营工厂情形也大体相同。像这样的例子各地都有很多。
    但是，公私合营企业今天仍然很少，根据一九五三年统计，全国资本主义工业中，按产值计算，只有百分之十二左右实行了公私合营。而发展公私合营，也是一件十分复杂的工作，它牵涉到公、私、劳、资等各个方面的关系。因此，今后一方面要积极发展公私合营，增加公私合营企业的数量，另一方面又必须采取稳步前进的方针，防止各种偏差。这就是说，要根据国家的需要、企业改造的可能和资本家自愿的原则，有计划、有步骤地进行。在进行合营以前或合营以后，对资本家进行教育，是十分重要的。
    目前，由于公私合营的优越性日益显著，由于过渡时期总任务的宣传，资本家中有愈来愈多的人申请公私合营，但也有不少资本家，还反映了不同程度的疑惧，这就需要向他们广泛深入地说明资本主义工商业必须进行社会主义改造的道理，说明人民政府改造资本主义工商业的具体政策，增加资本家对于实行公私合营的积极性。而对于坚持用各种违法行为进行反抗的资本家，则必须区别不同性质、不同程度，分别予以批判教育及适当处理，对于有严重破坏行为的分子则应给予惩处。
    在公私合营企业中，社会主义成分和公方代表在企业中必须占于领导地位，资本主义成分和私方则居于被领导地位。社会主义成分在企业中的领导地位，不取决于国家在个别企业中投资所占比重的大小，而是取决于国家政权的性质，取决于社会主义经济在国民经济中的领导地位，取决于公股代表同工人群众的结合和对资本家及其代理人的教育、改造，取决于这种领导能够确实地推动企业向前进步。在这个前提下，同时要承认私股的合法权益，使私股的合法权益受到保护。有些干部由于对公私合营企业的性质认识不明确，因而在企业领导上有放弃领导和忽视私股合法权益的或“右”或“左”的偏向，这种偏向应该迅速纠正。
    企业实行公私合营后，就为发挥企业中社会主义成分的优越性及其在企业中的领导地位和领导作用提供了可能。但还必须进行许多艰苦的工作，可能才能变为现实。其中主要工作之一，就是改革旧的经营管理制度，推行社会主义的先进的经营管理制度。但在进行改革时，必须稳步前进，不可急躁从事。企业的工资、福利、奖励等制度，应该参酌合营企业的原有基础和生产经营情况，参照国营企业的有关规定，逐步改进，逐步向相当的国营企业看齐。改革旧的经营管理制度就是社会主义的经营管理思想和资本主义的经营管理思想斗争的过程，是社会主义经营管理制度逐步代替资本主义经营管理制度的过程，所以必须依靠工人群众的觉悟性和组织性，要实行工人代表参加企业管理的制度，并广泛发动他们实行监督的权利。对资本家及资本家代理人的资本主义经营管理思想，要通过经常的公私协商和民主讨论，耐心地进行批判和教育，指导和帮助他们逐步改正。
    私方代表在公私合营企业的行政职务上有其一定的职位，在公方领导之下，他们应该是有职有权的，当然，他们也必须守职尽责，不能假公济私。对于企业原有的实职人员，应参酌原来情况，量材录用，成为企业干部并使他们有充分贡献其经营管理或技术才能的机会。对于在企业中有功绩但已丧失工作能力的原有实职人员，给予适当的照顾，对企业的实有财产，应根据公平合理的原则，由公私双方协商估价；对公私合营企业盈余的分配，除了依法缴纳所得税外，应当就企业的公积金、企业奖励金、股东股息红利几个方面合理地加以分配。
    目前的形势是有利于积极发展公私合营企业的。但是，也必须注意这是一个复杂而艰巨的工作。为了作好这项工作，必须坚决贯彻中央的各项政策，正确地运用国家的权力和法令，统一财经系统各有关部门的步调，依靠工人群众的觉悟性和组织性，加强对资本家的教育、改造工作。只要作好了这些工作，对资本主义工业的社会主义改造和发展公私合营工作，就一定能取得良好的成绩。
