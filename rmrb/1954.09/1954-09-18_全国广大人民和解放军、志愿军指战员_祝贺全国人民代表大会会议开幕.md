According to Xinhua News Agency: The broad masses of people across the country are welcoming the opening of the first session of the First National People's Congress with excitement and new labor achievements. On the day of the opening of the Congress, millions of people listened to the live broadcast of the National People's Congress meeting.

The people of the capital were inspired by Chairman Mao's opening speech and Liu Shaoqi's report. Workers in various factories have further launched labor competitions, and they have all proposed to dedicate the most satisfactory labor results to the Congress. The roving frame workshop and the spinning workshop of the Qinghe Woolen Mill launched a friendship competition to ensure the completion of the September production tasks. Each group of the locomotive workshop of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory has put forward guarantees to complete the September plan two or three days ahead of schedule.

Workers in Shanghai are determined to create better results to congratulate the convening of the Congress. Workers at the Shanghai Motor Factory are preparing to complete the task of trial-producing China's first 6,000-kilowatt giant generator during the first session of the First National People's Congress. Some freighters sailing on the ocean also sent telegrams to the Shanghai Maritime Administration, which read:
　　“Guarantee to load 50 tons of cargo more on each voyage” and “Overfulfill the September transportation task by 15 percent.”

Many employees of Jiang'an Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, Datong Machinery Factory, and other factories have completed their daily plans ahead of schedule. The people of Nanjing, Andong, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Jinhua, and other small and medium-sized cities were also very excited when they heard the news of the opening of the Congress, and they expressed their determination to congratulate this great event with practical actions.

Farmers were also欢欣鼓舞(rejoicing and inspired) by the opening of the meeting. On the evening of the 15th, members of the Xinghuo Collective Farm in Heilongjiang Province held a farm member meeting at the farm club. At the meeting, everyone unanimously expressed that they would launch a production increase and harvest guarantee competition to celebrate the opening of the National People's Congress meeting.

The people of the border areas also dedicated new production achievements to the National People's Congress meeting. After completing the summer grain tax in advance, the Uygur farmers of the Third Township of Seman District in Shufu County under the Pamir Plateau sold more than 53,000 jin of wheat from the bumper harvest to the state. The members of the Qianjin Production Cooperative in Daxing Township, Ya'an County, Xikang Province, proposed to complete the harvesting in advance, carefully thresh and collect, and overfulfill the original plan to increase production by 40 percent to congratulate the Congress.

According to Xinhua News Agency: The Army, Navy, and Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army warmly celebrate the opening of the National People's Congress meeting by guarding the motherland more vigilantly, stepping up political and military training, and actively preparing for the liberation of Taiwan.

The commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army troops in the southeastern coastal areas of the motherland immediately rejoiced after hearing the live broadcast of the opening of the National People's Congress meeting and Chairman Mao's opening speech. The commanders and fighters of a certain unit named "Dalian Island Company" enthusiastically carried out military operations on the beach. The soldiers' slogan was: "Don't be afraid of difficulties in training soldiers, improve your skills to liberate Taiwan!" When the Second Company of a certain unit held a night military exercise, it was windy and rainy, but all the commanders and fighters resolutely completed the exercise. The anti-aircraft artillery troops stationed in Shanghai proposed to learn from the participating troops on the Fujian front, and they are ready to deal a heavy blow to the Chiang bandit planes that dare to harass Shanghai at any time. The soldiers of a certain unit are more closely guarding the airspace of the motherland and carrying out their tasks tirelessly. They said happily: "For the convening of the National People's Congress meeting, we are willing to work harder." Chen Lifu, a combat hero of the East China Military Region Navy, and his comrades are carrying out patrol missions on the sea day and night. In order to more heavily strike the Chiang bandit army and liberate Taiwan, the pilots of an air force unit generally requested to fly and practice more.

The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in the rear of the motherland are also celebrating the convening of the National People's Congress meeting with more actively doing their work, stepping up training, and quickly improving the practical actions of modern military technology.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 17th: On September 15th, enthusiastic applause and cheers resounded from the vast number of commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Huai Ren Tang in Beijing at the same time. They celebrated the opening of the first session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China with infinite excitement.

At 3:00 pm (Beijing time) on the 15th, the radio stations of the Volunteer Army units rebroadcast the live broadcast of the Central People's Broadcasting Station on the first session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China. Many commanders and fighters of the troops stood calmly under the loudspeakers in the strong wind and rain to listen to the broadcast. When Chairman Mao delivered the opening speech, many commanders and fighters were so excited that they removed the rain cloth from their heads in the heavy rain and listened quietly. Some commanders and fighters also summarized and recorded Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China under the rain cloth. Many commanders and fighters of the troops repeated Chairman Mao's words with great excitement: "We are doing an extremely glorious and great cause that our predecessors have never done before. Our goal must be achieved. Our goal can definitely be achieved." Zhou Zhijian, a soldier of a certain unit who won the first-class merit, said: "We must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions, work wholeheartedly and diligently, heighten our vigilance, and guard our positions to contribute everything to defending the victory of the Korean armistice, defending the socialist construction of the motherland, and defending Asian and world peace."
