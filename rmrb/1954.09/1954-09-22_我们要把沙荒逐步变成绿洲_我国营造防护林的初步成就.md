China's Northwest and Inner Mongolia have vast, boundless deserts. In areas close to the deserts, wind and sand are a major disaster for people's lives. In the area between Northeast China and Inner Mongolia alone, there are 8.33 million hectares of wind-sand affected areas. Here, wind and sand endanger over 820,000 hectares of desert land, often jeopardizing harvests, and 60,000 hectares of mobile sand dunes bury or encroach upon farmland year after year. In western Hebei, the lower reaches of the Yongding River, and eastern Henan, large areas of desert or alkaline land have been created due to river flooding, changes in course, and wind and sand erosion. The farmers in these areas have historically lived in poverty and hardship. How to reduce wind and sand disasters? This has been the dream of people trapped in wind and sand areas for many years. In the past, farmers constantly fought against wind and sand. In Jilin, Liaoning, and the lower reaches of the Yongding River, they built small windbreaks to block wind and sand. However, under feudal rule, farmers had no land, no power, and their strength was dispersed. Despite their many efforts, they achieved little.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, people's long-held hopes began to be realized. The Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government successively formulated grand plans for building shelterbelts in 160 counties, cities, and banners in Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, Northwest China, western Hebei, and eastern Henan. Once these shelterbelts are successfully constructed, they will protect or transform 20.7 million hectares of farmland and desert land.

To realize the shelterbelt construction plan, the state has invested enormous resources over the past five years and has received the active participation of the vast number of farmers. In the preliminary implementation of the Western Northeast China Shelterbelt Program alone, the state dispatched 2,600 professional cadres and workers, established 129 afforestation stations and 133 nurseries, and cultivated over 3.8 billion seedlings. In just over three years, the farmers in this area contributed more than 6 million labor days to complete the afforestation of 210,000 hectares. In many areas, people organized themselves to implement mutual aid and cooperation, resolving the contradiction between busy farming seasons and afforestation. In the afforestation areas of five counties, including Xingtang in western Hebei, nearly 30,000 members in over 250 afforestation cooperatives mobilized the vast number of farmers to build more than 67,000 mu of shelterbelts. At present, the shelterbelt construction work in western Hebei, eastern Henan, and the lower reaches of the Yongding River has been basically completed. Over 218,000 hectares of shelterbelts have been built in western Northeast China and eastern Inner Mongolia. On the 3,000-li long sand control line from Yulin in Shaanxi to Jiuquan in Gansu, over 27,000 hectares of forest have been planted. As of the first half of this year, the total area of shelterbelts completed nationwide has reached over 650,000 hectares.

With the gradual completion of the shelterbelt construction plan, some desert areas have changed their original appearance.

In western Northeast China, one can already vaguely see green belts stretching intermittently for over 1,000 kilometers from north to south and 300 kilometers from east to west across the vast plains. Before long, the millions of hectares of desert land in this area will become productive farmland and fertile pastures. The living conditions of people in this area are changing. Daxing Village, Fourth District, Baicheng County, Heilongjiang Province, had most of its land exposed to wind erosion. Cultivating on this land often required replanting two or three times in the spring, and the autumn winds frequently knocked down the seedlings. The average yield was only two or three shi of grain per hectare. Afforestation began in 1951, and by last autumn, the village had built 19 hectares of forest belts. The young trees in the first two hectares planted were already over six chi tall. Under the protection of the forest belts, 17 mu of land yielded four shi and seven dou of grain in 1952 and five shi and four dou in 1953. In Xia Shulinzi Village, Aohan Banner, Rehe Province, the village area was 1,005 hectares. Eighty years ago, it was a forest area. Feudal landlords felled the forests, bringing wind and sand. By 1946, 95% of the village's arable land had become exposed to wind erosion, and floods had destroyed over 160 mu of farmland. People ate leaves and bran. Many farmers were forced by hunger and cold to flee the famine. After liberation, the villagers began afforestation in 1950, and by last year, they had restored and newly planted over 340 hectares of young forest. These network-like young forests transformed over 3,000 mu of desert land and protected over 4,000 mu of land exposed to wind erosion. In the forest network, the farmland of Zhang Ziji and ten other households yielded less than one dou per mu in 1944, but by 1952, the yield had reached five dou per mu. As the young forest grew, it not only protected the farmland but also increased sideline income. The village's 147 households averaged 20 mu of young forest per household, and the total income from forestry sidelines in the village was worth over 340,000 jin of grain in three years. Today, not only are there no more famine refugees in the village, but new residents have also moved in. Farmers' lives have begun to improve, and the number of children attending school is constantly increasing. In three years, the village also built 248 new houses.

In western Hebei, the construction of the shelterbelt network to eliminate the three major deserts began in 1949. In the past, the wind and sand buried fields and houses, and even filled up wells. The land close to the desert could not only not grow wheat, but other crops had to be sown three or five times each year. Whenever a strong wind blew in the spring, farmers couldn't sleep well, fearing that the seedlings would be destroyed by the wind and sand. As soon as the wind stopped, the whole family had to rush to the field with shovels and baskets to laboriously shovel and move the sand. After removing the sand, they anxiously waited for the seedlings to emerge. At that time, they couldn't help but sincerely pray: "Whoever helps us control the wind and sand, we will surely build a temple for him!" Now, on this 117,000-plus mu of desert land left behind by the flooding and changes in course of the Ci River and Sha River thousands of years ago, over 67,000 mu of shelterbelts have been built, fixing all the desert land. By the autumn of 1952, many young forests near the edges of cultivated land had grown to over one zhang tall. Most of the autumn harvests were no longer affected by wind disasters, and yields increased. Land exposed to wind erosion that could not grow wheat in the past has been turned into wheat fields. The 105 villages in the entire desert area have increased wheat fields by a total of about 31,500 mu compared to before afforestation. In some villages, the yield of wheat per mu has reached 120 to 130 jin. Here, pure desert land has also been transformed into cultivable land. ?? Village, Xingtang County, cultivated 160 mu of pure desert land last year and harvested 40,000 jin of peanuts. In 1953, according to statistics from only four counties, including Zhengding and Xingtang, over 47,000 jin of Amorpha fruticosa leaves (a very good fertilizer) were harvested on the afforested sandy land.

In eastern Henan, due to the repeated changes in the course of the Yellow River, especially after the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang breached the dike at Huayuankou, nearly 4.2 million mu of desert and alkaline land were left to the local people in 17 counties. Hundreds of thousands of people in the sandy areas struggled in hunger and were often forced to migrate to other places in groups to escape the famine. For example, Xizhai Village in ?? County had not harvested wheat for 18 years. In 1946, out of the village's 760 people, over 130 people left their homes to beg for a living. After liberation, the farmers actively responded to the various calls of the People's Government and created a dense network of windbreaks on 1.8 million mu of desert land within five years. Now, the four-year-old trees are five or six chi to over one zhang tall, and the five-year-old willow trees have grown to over ten centimeters thick. The desert has been tamed. Many tall sand dunes are surrounded by dense young forests of several or dozens of rows, gradually being leveled by the wind. The fallen leaves on the trees are turning into humus, slowly changing the nature of the sandy soil. Since 1952, large amounts of desert land near the forest network and within the network have been able to be cultivated. In Cai Gang Village, Fourth District, former Lanfeng County, 120 households previously only cultivated 200-plus mu of land, but last year they increased the area to 800 mu. In the forest network, every household also planted two or three mu of cotton. According to estimates by the Henan Provincial Forestry Bureau, the arable land in the sandy area of eastern Henan has been expanded by about 150,000 mu in the past six months, which is equivalent to adding three mu of cultivated land per 50,000 farmers.

Anyone who has been to Kaifeng, Henan, is familiar with the fact that for many years, the endless desert and the city walls connected in the northern suburbs of Kaifeng. Pedestrians and vehicles did not need to pass through the city gates and could enter and exit the city by using sand dunes. Today, that large area of desert is covered by green shade, with "rows of poplars and shade of willows." Neat and dense forest belts, like millions of green walls, protect 20,000 mu of farmland. Coupled with a series of production increase measures taken by the People's Government, last year saw the first bumper harvest in over 20 years. In Tucheng Township, which was originally relatively barren, the total land area of the township is over 15,700 mu. In 1950, there was not a single mu of wheat field; in 1951, 710 mu of wheat were planted, yielding 46 jin per mu; last year, the wheat planting area expanded to 3,200 mu, and the yield per mu increased to 110 jin, with the highest yield reaching 350 jin.

In the sand dunes of the Fourth District of former Lanfeng County, after the construction of shelterbelts, a large orchard with an area of 5,000 mu also appeared, planting tens of thousands of pear trees, apple trees, and grapevines that have already borne fruit.

"Turning deserts into oases" is no longer a myth in our country. In just five years, we have already seen these facts. Of course, it is still too early to talk about the effects of our country's shelterbelt construction. If we look at the development prospects of the country's socialist economic construction, our afforestation work is only just beginning. In the not-too-distant future, hundreds of kilometers of railways will pass through deserts and grasslands, and hundreds of millions of mu of wasteland will be gradually reclaimed. Therefore, large-scale shelterbelt construction is needed in vast areas such as Northwest China and Inner Mongolia to cooperate with this. The extremely arduous and great task of transforming nature requires us to overcome all difficulties and complete it step by step. Today, in the new China where 600 million people are in charge, we believe that any miracle can be created.

    我们要把沙荒逐步变成绿洲
    ——我国营造防护林的初步成就

    李范五
    我国西北和内蒙古有广阔无垠的沙漠。靠近沙漠的地区，风沙是人民生活上的一大灾害。仅东北和内蒙之间，就有八百三十三万公顷风沙地区。在这里，八十二万多公顷沙荒地，因为风沙为害，收成常常没有保障，六万公顷流动沙丘连年埋没或侵占着农田。在河北西部，及永定河下游河南东部等地区，由于河流的泛滥、改道和风沙的侵袭，造成大片的沙荒或碱地。这些地区的农民，历来过着贫穷困苦的生活。怎样减免风沙灾害呢？这是许多年来困顿于风沙地区的人民所梦寐以求的事。过去，农民们曾经和风沙作过不断的斗争。在吉林、辽宁、永定河下游，他们曾营造过小型防风林来阻挡风沙。然而，在封建统治下的农民，一没有地，二没有权，力量又是分散的，虽然作了不少的努力，却没有收到多少效果。
    一九四九年中华人民共和国成立以后，人们的多年希望开始实现了。中国共产党和人民政府在东北、内蒙、西北、河北、河南东部的一百六十个县、市、旗的范围内，先后制订了营造防护林的宏大计划。这些地区的防护林营造成功后，就能保护或改造二千零七十万公顷的农田和沙荒。
    为了实现防护林的营造计划，五年来国家投入了巨大的力量，并且得到了广大农民的积极参加。仅在初步实施东北西部防护林的计划中，国家就曾派遣了二千六百名专业干部和工人，建立了一百二十九个造林站和一百三十三处苗圃，培育了三十八亿多株苗木。在三年多的时间内，这一带地区的农民仅为完成二十一万公顷的造林工作，就付出了六百多万个劳动日。在许多地区，人们组织起来实行互助合作，解决了农忙和造林的矛盾。河北西部行唐等五县的造林地区，在二百五十多个造林合作社，将近三万个社员的带动下，广大农民组织起来营造了防护林六万七千多亩。现在，河北西部、河南东部、永定河下游三处的防护林营造工作已基本完成。东北西部、内蒙东部已营造防护林二十一万八千多公顷。陕西、甘肃境内东起榆林西至酒泉长达三千里的防沙线上，已造林二万七千多公顷。全国防护林的营造，截至今年上半年，总计已完成六十五万多公顷。
    随着营造防护林计划的逐步完成，若干沙荒地带改变了原来的面貌。
    在东北西部，人们如果在高空俯瞰，已经隐约可以看到一条条绿色的林带，断续地穿过南北千余公里，东西三百公里的广阔原野。不要多久，这一带的千万顷沙荒地，将变成丰产的农田和肥美的牧场。这带地区人们的生活条件正在变化。黑龙江省的白城县四区大兴村，大部土地原是跑风地。在这种地上耕种，春天往往要毁种两、三次，秋季的狂风又经常刮倒禾苗，一公顷地平均才打两三石粮食。一九五一年开始造林，到去年秋天全村营造了十九公顷林带。第一年造的两公顷林带，幼树已有六尺多高。在林带的保护下，一九五二年十七亩地打了四石七斗谷子，一九五三年打了五石四斗。热河省敖汉旗的下树林子村，全村面积一千零五公顷。八十多年前曾是林区。封建地主砍伐了森林，带来了风沙。到一九四六年全村百分之九十五的耕地成了跑风地，洪水又冲毁耕地一百六十多亩。那时人们吃树叶、吃糠皮。不少农民为饥寒所迫，向外逃荒。解放后，全村农民从一九五○年开始造林，到去年止，共恢复和新造幼林三百四十多公顷。这些网状的幼林，改造了三千多亩沙荒地，保护了四千多亩跑风地。在林网里的张子季等十户的耕地，一九四四年每亩产量不足一斗，到一九五二年每亩产量已达五斗。幼林长起来，不仅保护了农田，还增加了副业收入。全村一百四十七户，平均每户有幼林二十亩，三年中全村林木副业收益共值三十四万多斤粮食。如今全村不仅没有了逃荒户，而且搬来了新的住户。农民生活开始改善了，入学儿童不断增加。三年之中，全村还盖了二百四十八间新房。
    在河北西部，消灭三大沙荒的防护林网是从一九四九年开始营造的。过去，这里的风沙掩埋了田地、房屋，水井也填干了。靠近沙荒的田地，非但不能种麦子，连别的庄稼每年也要播种三、五次。春季一刮大风，农民就睡不好觉，担心禾苗被风沙摧毁。只要风一住，就得出动全家，一齐跑到地里去用铁锹和簸箕艰难地往外铲沙子，搬沙子，搬掉了沙子，就焦急地天天盼望着幼苗出土。那时，他们不由得衷心地祈望：“谁要帮助咱们制服风沙，
  一定给他修个庙！”现在在这块千百年前由磁河、沙河泛滥和改道遗留下来的十一万七千多亩沙荒上，因为营造了六万七千多亩防护林，已把全部沙荒固定下来。到一九五二年秋季，许多靠近耕地边缘的幼林已高达丈余。秋收作物大多不遭风灾了，产量提高了。过去不能种小麦的跑风地改成了麦田。全沙荒区一百零五个村庄，比造林前共约增加了麦田三万一千五百亩。有的村子，每亩麦的产量已达到一百二、三十斤。在这里，纯沙荒也被改造成了能够种植的土地。行唐县??村去年新开垦的纯沙荒一百六十亩，收了四万斤花生。一九五三年，仅据正定、行唐等四县的统计，在造林的沙地上，共采紫穗槐叶四万七千多斤（是很好的肥料）。
    在河南东部地区，因为黄河屡次改道，特别是蒋介石匪帮在花园口决堤放水以后，给当地十七县人民留下了将近四百二十万亩的沙荒和碱地。沙区成千累万的群众在饥饿中挣扎，常常被迫成群结队地向外地流徙逃荒。如?县西砦村十八年没收过麦子。一九四六年全村七百六十人，有一百三十多人离乡背井以讨乞为生。解放后，农民积极响应人民政府的各项号召，五年之内在一百八十万亩沙荒上，造成了密布的防风林网。现在，种了四年的树高五、六尺到一丈多，种上五年的柳树已长到十来公分粗。沙荒被驯服下来了。许多高大的沙丘被数行或数十行密密的幼林包围着，逐渐被风刮平。树上的落叶变成的腐植质慢慢地改变着沙土的性质。一九五二年起，在林网附近和网眼内的大量沙荒已能垦种。原兰封县四区蔡冈村百二十户人家，以前只种二百几十亩地，去年增种了八百亩。在林网里，家家户户还种了二、三亩棉花。据河南省林业局估计：河南东部沙区近半年来扩大耕地约十五万亩，等于给五万农民每人增加了三亩耕地。
    去过河南开封的人都很熟悉，多少年来，开封北郊一望无际的沙荒和城墙连接起来，行人和车辆不用过城门，只须借着沙堆，便可出城入城。今天，那大片沙荒已为绿荫所覆盖，“杨树成行，柳树成荫”，整齐茂密的林带像千万座绿色的墙，保护着二万亩农田。加上人民政府采取的一系列增产措施，去年这里已出现二十多年来的第一次丰收。原来较为贫瘠的土城乡，全乡土地面积一万五千七百多亩，一九五零年还没有一亩麦田；一九五一年开始种小麦七百一十亩，每亩收麦四十六斤；去年种麦面积扩大到三千二百亩，每亩产量提高到一百一十斤，最高产量达三百五十斤。
    在原兰封县四区的沙丘里，防护林营造以后，还出现了面积五千亩的大果园，种植了千万株梨树、苹果树和已经结实累累的葡萄。
      “沙漠变成绿洲”在我国来说已经不是神话，仅仅五年的时光我们就已看到这些事实。当然，现在来谈我国营造防护林带的效果还是为时太早，如果从国家社会主义经济建设事业的发展前途来看，我们的造林事业更仅仅是开始。不太远的将来，有千百公里的铁道要通过沙漠和草原，有亿万亩荒地将要逐步开垦；因此，在西北、内蒙古等广大地区都需要大量营造防护林来配合。十分艰巨和伟大的改造自然的任务，要我们克服一切困难去一步一步地完成。在今天，六亿人民自己当家作主了的新中国，我们相信，什么奇迹都是可以创造出来的。
