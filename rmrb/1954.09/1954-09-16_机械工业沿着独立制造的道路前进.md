The machine industry has been developing rapidly during the period of our country's economic recovery and planned construction. When the people of the whole country concentrated their efforts on building the Anshan Iron and Steel Base, the workers of the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant sent an automatic cone crusher manufactured by themselves, which can crush ore equivalent to twenty-seven trains per hour; the workers of the Jinan No. 2 Machine Tool Plant sent a "724" gantry planer manufactured by themselves; the workers of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant sent a precision large lathe manufactured by themselves, which is controlled entirely by electricity; the workers of the Shenyang Transformer Plant sent a 20,000 kVA transformer manufactured by themselves; and the workers of the Shanghai Wire Factory sent cables manufactured by themselves. A complete set of hydroelectric power station equipment manufactured in our country has been installed in Fujian Province, and the electricity it generates is sufficient to illuminate a city of 300,000 residents. The latest modern coal mining machine manufactured by the Jixi Mining Bureau General Machinery Plant—the Donbass Type 1 combined coal mining machine—has been put into operation in the mines, and it can mine 50 to 100 tons of raw coal per hour, effortlessly loading them into the roadway conveyor. Drilling machines manufactured by the Fushun Heavy Machinery Plant and the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant have been transported to Baotou and Daye, where they are being used to survey the resources of future iron and steel bases. Locomotives manufactured by the Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant are speeding on the railways. The "Minzhong," "Renmin No. 1," and "Dazhong" ships built by Shanghai's shipbuilding workers have been launched, and they will appear on the Yangtze River transportation line and will become the largest vessels capable of navigating the dangerous shoals of the Three Gorges and reaching Chongqing directly. On the vast ocean, a 1,200-horsepower ocean-going tugboat manufactured in our country is being tested under the impact of strong winds and waves of force seven or eight. All its equipment is electrically operated and can sail continuously at sea for twenty-seven days without needing to dock.

These are not ordinary achievements, but achievements that mark a fundamental change in China's machinery industry. The appearance of the famous Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai eighty-nine years ago marked the beginning of the history of modern machinery industry in China; but before the five-star red flag first flew over Tiananmen Square, who had ever seen Jiangnan Shipyard independently manufacture a ship? Who had ever seen our country manufacture a locomotive? This was not because our machinery industry workers were not smart enough at that time, nor was it because our country did not need these things at that time, but simply because the fate of our country was in the hands of imperialists, bureaucratic capitalists, and feudal warlords at that time. The imperialists set up machine factories in our country only to repair and refit the machines they shipped in and to accelerate the plunder of our country's resources; the feudal warlords established machine factories only to repair and refit weapons. They were all afraid that our country would have an independent machine manufacturing industry, so they firmly restricted China's machinery industry to the level of repair and refitting in terms of technology transfer, equipment and raw material supply, and market prices. When this restriction was about to be completely broken by the revolutionary forces of the Chinese people, they began to destroy factories, dismantle and sell machines, turn factories into ruins, and turn workshops into stables.

The recent five years have been five years of unprecedented rapid progress in China's machinery industry. We remember that in the early days of the economic recovery period, it was the Chinese Communist Party that led all the workers to clear the weeds in the factory yards, sweep away the horse manure and furnace ash in the workshops, and unload the feeding troughs tied to the machines, so that the factories destroyed by the enemy could be quickly revived and put on the road of independent manufacturing. We remember that it was the Chinese Communist Party that led all the workers to eliminate the reactionary remnants in the enterprises and establish new production relations before rationalization proposals and labor competitions could burn like a prairie fire, greatly increasing production capacity. We remember that it was the Chinese Communist Party that led the workers to learn from the advanced technology and experience of the Soviet Union, which enabled them to triple or quadruple their production capacity. We also remember that when the imperialists imposed a blockade on our country, it was the Soviet Union that sent us new technical equipment, new product drawings, and experts, which enabled our manufacturing technology to improve rapidly.

China's machinery industry has been advancing along the road of independent manufacturing and socialism for five years. The capabilities of many factories have multiplied, and last year the output value of enterprises under the First Ministry of Machine Building exceeded twelve and a half times that of the year the People's Republic of China was founded. China's machinery industry has already become an industrial sector that has formed forty manufacturing systems, can manufacture more than 1,900 relatively important products, and can meet half of the needs of China's large-scale economic construction in terms of product quantity.

However, China's machine industry is far from meeting the needs of the country. It must supply the construction of heavy industry and national defense industry with all equipment; at the same time, it must correspondingly supply the construction of light industry, transportation industry with equipment; and correspondingly supply agriculture, handicrafts, etc. with modern equipment needed in the socialist transformation. To this end, the machinery industry is gradually improving its technology by expanding the manufacturing of new products, and the machinery industry is building and rebuilding a number of modern factories. When the representatives of the First National People's Congress gathered in the capital to discuss the first constitution of the Chinese people, the workers of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant were trial-producing new Soviet-style automatic lathes; the workers of the Harbin Electrical Machinery Plant were trial-producing 10,000 kW, the largest hydro-generator made in China; and the workers of the Shanghai Electrical Machinery Plant, Turbine Plant, and Boiler Plant were jointly manufacturing the first set of the largest (6,000 kW) thermal power equipment made in China. Now, the Chongqing Air Compressor Plant, which was rebuilt on the basis of a textile machinery plant, has already been put into production. The reconstruction project of the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Plant is in the final stage of construction. The construction of the first factory to manufacture precision tools—precision to the point where the quality must be inspected with solar instruments that magnify 10,000 times—the Harbin Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Plant, has installed most of the machines and will soon be put into full production. A new factory for manufacturing precision electrical meters and instruments is under intense construction, and some of the factory buildings will be completed this year. The first mechanized and automated factory for manufacturing working machine tools is being rebuilt, and it is expected that most of it will be completed next year. The construction of the large-scale First Automobile Manufacturing Plant has entered the stage of machine installation, and it is expected that a number of workshops will be put into production by the end of this year and the beginning of next year. The tractor manufacturing plant is building dedicated railways and workers' dormitories, and large-scale construction is expected to begin next year. The construction projects of the Second Automobile Manufacturing Plant, Heavy Machinery Plant, etc. have also begun preparations.

China's machinery industry is advancing along with the motherland. In the not-too-distant future, we will see cars made in China driving on the land of the motherland; tractors made in China plowing the fields of the motherland!

    机械工业沿着独立制造的道路前进
    陆超祺
    在我国经济恢复和有计划地进行建设的日子里，我国机械工业都在飞跃地发展着。当全国人民集中力量建设鞍山钢铁基地的时候，沈阳重型机器厂的职工送去自己制造的自动化圆锥破碎机，它每小时破碎的矿石可以装二十七辆火车；济南第二机床厂的职工送去自己制造的“七二四”型龙门刨床；沈阳第一机床厂的职工送去自己制造的精密的大车床，它们全是用电器操纵的；沈阳变压器厂的职工送去自己制造的二万千伏安的变压器；上海电线厂的职工送去自己制造的电缆。我国制造的全套水力发电站设备已经在福建省安装起来，它发出的电力足够三十万居民的城市的照明用。鸡西矿务局总机械厂制造的现代最新的采煤机械——顿巴斯一型联合采煤机已经在矿坑里开动起来，它每小时能掘五十吨到一百吨原煤，并毫不费力地把它们装进巷道的运输机里去。抚顺重型机器厂和太原矿山机器厂制造的钻探机已经运到了包头和大冶，在那里，人们正用它们来勘测未来的钢铁基地的资源。青岛四方机车车辆厂制造的机车在铁路上疾驰。上海的造船工人制造的“民众号”、“人民一号”和“大众号”轮船已经举行了下水典礼，它们将出现在长江运输线上，并将成为能通过三峡的险滩而直达重庆的最大船只。在白茫茫的海洋上，我国制造的一千二百匹马力的远洋拖船，在七、八级大风和巨浪的冲击下试航，它的全部设备都是用电气来操纵的，可以在海上连续航行二十七天不必靠岸。
    这些，并不是普普通通的成就，而是标志着我国机械工业发生根本性的变化的成就。八十九年前著名的江南造船厂在上海的出现，就揭开了我国现代机械工业历史的序幕；但在五星红旗第一次在天安门上空飘扬以前，有谁看见江南造船厂独立制造过一只轮船？有谁看见我国制造过一个火车头？这不是因为我国机械工业工人在那时候不够聪明，也不是因为我国在那时候不需要这些东西，而仅仅是因为我们国家的命运在那时候掌握在帝国主义、官僚资本主义和封建军阀的手里。帝国主义者在我国设立机器厂，只是为了修配他们运进来的机器，为了加速掠夺我国资源；封建军阀建立机器厂，只是为了修配武器。他们都害怕我国有独立的机器制造工业，于是从技术传授、从设备和原材料供应、从市场价格方面，把我国机械工业牢牢地限制在修配性的水平上。当这种限制将要被我国人民革命力量彻底打破的时候，他们便动手破坏厂房，拆卖机器，把工厂变成废墟，把车间变成马厩。
    最近的五年，是我国机械工业以空前迅速的步伐前进的五年。我们记得，在经济恢复时期的初期，是中国共产党领导着全体职工铲除了工厂院落中的蒿草，扫除了车间里的马粪和炉灰，卸下拴在机器上的喂马槽子，使被敌人破坏了的工厂迅速地复活起来，并把它引上独立制造的道路。我们记得，是中国共产党领导全体职工肃清了企业内部的反动残余势力，建立了新的生产关系以后，合理化建议，劳动竞赛，才像燎原的大火一样熊熊地燃烧起来，大大地提高了生产能力。我们记得，是中国共产党领导职工学习了苏联的先进技术和先进经验，才能三、四倍地提高了生产能力。我们也记得，当帝国主义者对我国实行封锁的时候，是苏联给我们送来新的技术设备，给我国送来新的产品图样，给我国派来了专家，我国的制造技术才得以迅速提高。
    我国机械工业沿着独立制造，沿着社会主义的道路前进了五年。许多工厂的能力成倍地发展着，去年第一机械工业部所属企业的产值超过了中华人民共和国成立那一年的十二倍半。我国机械工业已经是一个形成了四十个制造系统，能制造一千九百多种比较重要的产品，在产品数量上能够满足我国大规模经济建设的一半需要的工业部门。
    然而，我国机器工业还远远没有满足国家的要求。它要供给重工业和国防工业建设以一切设备；同时它要相应地供给轻工业、交通运输业的建设以设备；相应地供应农业、手工业等在社会主义改造中所需要的现代设备。为此，机械工业正在通过扩大新产品的制造逐步提高自己的技术，机械工业正在新建和改建一批现代化的工厂。当第一届全国人民代表大会的代表们聚集在首都讨论我国人民第一个宪法的时候，沈阳第一机床厂的职工们正在试制苏联新式的自动车床；哈尔滨电机厂的职工们正在试制一万瓩——我国自制最大的水轮发电机；上海电机厂、汽轮机厂和锅炉厂的职工们，正在共同制造我国自制第一套最大的（六千瓩）火力发电设备。现在，在一个纺织机械厂的基础上进行改建的重庆空气压缩机厂早已投入生产。沈阳风动工具厂的改建工程，正在进行最后一部分工程。新建的第一座制造精密工具——精密到必须用日光仪器来放大一万倍才能检验质量——的工厂——哈尔滨量具刃具厂的大部分机器已经安装好了，不久就可以全部投入生产。新建的一个制造精密的电表仪器的工厂正在紧张地施工中，有部分厂房将在今年内完成。第一座机械化自动化制造工作母机的工厂正在改建中，预计明年可以大部完成。规模宏大的第一汽车制造厂的建设已经进入安装机器的阶段，预计今年年底和明年年初将有一批车间投入生产。拖拉机制造厂正在建设专用铁路和工人宿舍，预计明年就可以大规模施工。第二汽车制造厂、重型机器厂等建设工程，也都已经开始筹备了。
    我国机械工业跟着祖国一道前进。在不要很久的将来，我们会看到我国制造的汽车在祖国的大地上行驶；我国制造的拖拉机在祖国的田野里耕地了！
