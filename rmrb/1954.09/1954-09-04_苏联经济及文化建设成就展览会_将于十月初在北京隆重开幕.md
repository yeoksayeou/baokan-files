    Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements Exhibition
    To Open Grandly in Beijing in Early October

    [By Our Newspaper] The Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements Exhibition will open grandly in Beijing in early October.

    The construction of the exhibition hall is basically completed. From afar, one can see the exhibition hall's towering gilded spire shining in the sunlight. The exhibition hall covers an area of 110,000 square meters and can accommodate 8,840 people working inside (calculated at 5 square meters per person); the minimum interior height is 9 meters, which is twice as high as civil residences and office buildings.

    The interior of the hall is decorated with extraordinary solemnity and magnificence. Exquisite wood carvings, colorful marble, and inlaid details adorn the exhibition hall like a palace.

    The exhibition mainly includes sixteen pavilions: the Central Hall, three Cultural Halls (with lounges), a Small Exhibition Hall, an Agricultural Hall, a Cinema, an Industrial Hall with a span of 32 meters (with four small machine halls on the first floor on its sides, and two large light industrial halls and the Moscow Restaurant on the second floor). In addition, there is also an open-air theater that can accommodate 2,700 spectators.

    Each exhibition hall will display many samples, models, photos, pictures, maps, charts, and statistical tables, from which people can see the achievements of the Soviet Union in economic and cultural construction.

    The Industrial Hall is the largest hall in the exhibition. Walking inside is like walking into a large Soviet factory, with various types of machines on display. Fifty percent of these are metal cutting machine tools, and fifty percent are textile equipment, electrical equipment, printing presses, compressors, etc. In the square, there are also comfortable and beautiful cars, buses, various trucks, automatic unloading trucks, as well as drilling, oil extraction, and well repair machines. In addition, there are truck-mounted cranes, multi-bucket ditchers, single-bucket excavators, universal shovel excavators, etc., among which multi-bucket ditchers have not yet been used in China. The exhibits in the Industrial Hall fully demonstrate the powerful development and advancement of Soviet industry.

    In addition to various agricultural machines, the Agricultural Hall also exhibits models of the Grand Canal Hydropower Station and various models of irrigation systems. From here, we can see that national industrialization is the foundation for the socialist transformation of agriculture. This hall is a glorious summary of the thirty-seven-year history of agricultural development in the Soviet Union.

    In addition to models of Moscow University, several major Soviet universities, and vocational schools, the Cultural Hall also displays classic works of Marxism-Leninism, classical literature, children's literature, literary novels, and textbooks for universities, middle schools, and specialized colleges. People can see from this hall that with the development of the national economy, the number of Soviet higher education institutions is increasing year by year, and the number of students is also increasing, which enables the younger generation in the Soviet Union to enjoy higher education and acquire advanced cultural and scientific knowledge. It also shows the brilliant achievements of the Soviet nationalities in natural sciences, social sciences, and literature and art.

    The Small Exhibition Hall has exquisite glassware, handicrafts, maiden embroidery, lace, gems, paintings, cosmetics, etc. These practical works of art reflect the continuous improvement of the Soviet people's material and cultural life.

    During the opening of the exhibition, the Soviet National Folk Dance Troupe and the Soviet People's Artists Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko Musical Theatre Opera and Dance Troupe will perform wonderful programs. In addition, movies will be shown frequently.

    In order to better exchange experience, during the exhibition, Soviet experts, socialist labor heroes, and advanced production workers will hold various small-scale seminars and report meetings with Chinese industrial and agricultural model workers; some experts will also go down to the field for specific guidance. Famous figures in Soviet literature and art will also conduct various friendship activities with Chinese literary and art workers. Through the exhibition, the Chinese people will receive a profound and specific socialist education, so that the Chinese people will have a further, more in-depth, and comprehensive understanding of the great achievements of the Soviet people in building socialism and communism, thereby encouraging the Chinese people to transition to socialism with full confidence. At the same time, it will further strengthen economic and cultural cooperation between China and the Soviet Union and deepen the friendship between the two peoples.

    苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会
    将于十月初在北京隆重开幕
    【本报讯】苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会将于十月初在北京隆重开幕。
    展览馆的建筑工程基本上已经完工。人们在很远很远的地方就可以看见展览馆高耸的镏金尖塔在阳光里闪耀着金光。展览馆占地面积为十一万平方公尺，可容纳八千八百四十人在里面办公（以一人占五平方公尺计算）；室内最低为九公尺，比民用房屋和机关办公室要高出两倍。
    馆内装修得异常庄严瑰丽。精美的木刻、五颜六色的大理石以及镶嵌细工，把展览馆打扮得像宫殿一样。
    展览会中主要包括十六个展览馆：中央大厅，三个文化馆（附带有休息室），小展览厅，农业馆，电影院，跨度三十二公尺的工业馆（在它的两侧：一楼是四个小型机器馆，二楼是两个大轻工业馆、莫斯科餐厅）。此外还有一个可容纳二千七百观众的露天剧场。
    各个展览馆都将展出许多样品、模型、照片、图画、地图、图表和统计表等，从这些展品中，人们可以看出苏联在经济和文化建设方面的成就。
    工业馆是展览会中最大的一个馆。人们走进去，就像走到苏联一个大工厂一样，里面陈列着各式各样的机器。其中百分之五十是金属切削机床，有百分之五十是纺织设备、电气设备、印刷机、压缩机等。在广场上还陈列着舒适美观的小汽车、公共汽车、各种载重车、自动卸货车，以及钻探、采油、修井等机器。此外，还有车载式起重机，多斗挖沟机、单斗挖掘机、万能铲挖掘机等，其中多斗挖沟机在中国还没有使用过。工业馆中的展览品充分表现了苏联工业的强大发展和先进性。
    农业馆中，除展出各种农业机器以外，还有大运河水电站模型，以及灌溉系统的各种模型。从这里我们可以看出国家工业化是农业社会主义改造的基础。这个馆是苏联三十七年农业发展史的光荣总结。
    文化馆里面除陈列有莫斯科大学、苏联几个主要大学、专科学校的模型外，还有马克思列宁主义经典著作、古典文学、儿童文学、文艺小说、以及大学、中学、专门学院教科书等。人们从这个馆可以看出随着国民经济的发展，苏联高等学校的数目在逐年增加，就学人数也随着增加，这使苏联年青的一代越来越多地能享受高等教育，获得高级的文化科学知识。还可以看出苏联各民族在自然科学、社会科学以及文学艺术方面所获得的辉煌成果。
    小型展览厅里有精制的玻璃器皿、手工艺品、少女刺绣、花边、宝石、画片、化妆品等。这些实用的艺术品，反映了苏联人民物质文化生活的不断提高。
    在展览会开幕期间，将有苏联国立民间舞蹈团和苏联人民演员斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基和涅米海维奇—丹钦柯音乐剧院歌舞团演出精彩节目。此外，还经常放映电影。
    为了更好地交流经验，展览期间，苏联专家、社会主义劳动英雄、先进生产工作者将和我国工、农业模范们举行各种小型座谈会、报告会；有些专家还要下场具体指导。苏联文学、艺术界著名人士与我国文学、艺术工作者，也将进行各种友谊活动。通过展览会，我国人民将受到一次深刻而具体的社会主义教育，使我国人民对苏联人民在建设社会主义与共产主义事业中所获得的伟大成就，得到进一步的比较深入的、全面的认识，从而鼓舞我国人民信心百倍地向社会主义过渡。同时将进一步密切中苏两国的经济文化的合作，加深两国人民的友谊。
