    Developing Normal International Trade Relations
    Ping Shu
    While we are continuously strengthening economic cooperation and expanding trade with the Soviet Union and the various People's Democratic countries, we are willing, on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, to develop and expand economic cooperation and trade relations with other countries in the world, regardless of their social and economic systems, and regardless of whether or not they have diplomatic relations with our country. Because the development and expansion of such trade relations is conducive to the enhancement of friendship between each other, the improvement of the living standards of the people of all countries, and the consolidation of the cause of world peace.

    The US aggressive bloc has adopted a “blockade and embargo” policy that is hostile to the people of our country, hindering the development of normal international trade. This is part of the US monopoly capitalist group's aggressive policy aimed at dominating the world. It attempts to strangle economic exchanges between our country and other countries; and, by taking advantage of the fact that other countries, after following its "blockade and embargo" and losing the traditional market in the East, have no choice but to become more economically dependent on the United States, it uses various shameless means to打击与排挤 its competitors, in order to further monopolize the resources and markets of the entire capitalist world.

    The "blockade and embargo" policy of the US aggressive bloc has not achieved the desired effect. In the past four years, the total value of our foreign trade has increased more than fivefold, and trade relations have been established with governments or business circles in more than fifty countries.

    Those who are truly harmed by this "blockade and embargo" are the countries that pursue this policy of the US aggressive bloc.

    Due to the implementation of the "blockade and embargo" policy of the US aggressive bloc, the trade volume of many capitalist countries with our country and with the People's Democratic countries has been greatly reduced, inevitably causing serious damage to the economies of these countries. The US aggressive bloc does not allow these countries to export their industrial products to our country and the People's Democratic countries in exchange for the agricultural products and raw materials they need; instead, it dumps its own agricultural products, raw materials, and other commodities to these countries at high prices; and tries every possible means to prevent the commodities of these countries from entering the US domestic market. This cannot but create a long-term huge trade deficit for these countries in their trade with the United States. In the seven years from 1946 to 1953, the trade deficit of capitalist countries with the United States reached a staggering figure of 50 billion US dollars. Accompanied by trade deficits and balance of payments deficits, industrial production in these countries has continued to decline, the number of unemployed has increased sharply, and the living conditions of the working people have deteriorated. For example, the total number of unemployed in the twelve major capitalist countries in Western Europe last year increased by 45 percent compared to 1948.

    Those countries that rely on raw material exports as their main source of income are even more subjected to the brutal plunder by the US aggressive bloc, which arbitrarily lowers the prices of raw materials and dumps its own surplus commodities. After Southeast Asian countries such as Malaya and Thailand were forced to implement "blockade and embargo," causing raw material prices to plummet and export volumes to decline, their foreign trade transformed from a surplus to a huge deficit, and their economic lives fell into a difficult situation. Last year, Malaya's total export value decreased by 51.3 percent compared to 1951. Despite Malaya's efforts to reduce imports and take other measures, it still had a deficit of more than 307 million Malayan dollars. As for the damage suffered by Japan from the "blockade and embargo," it is particularly serious. Coal, salt, iron sand, soybeans, and other goods needed by Japanese industry were mostly imported from our country in the past. Since the US aggressive bloc forcibly implemented the "blockade and embargo" and controlled Japan's foreign trade, Japan has had to import these commodities from the United States at high prices, which costs 200 million US dollars more each year than importing from our country.

    These situations cannot but arouse increasingly strong opposition from these countries to this policy of the US aggressive bloc. The broad masses of people in capitalist countries have always opposed this "blockade and embargo" and demanded the expansion of normal international trade. Business figures and far-sighted politicians in capitalist countries are also increasingly frequently demanding the restoration and development of trade with our country, the Soviet Union, and the People's Democratic countries in order to alleviate their economic difficulties. At the International Economic Conference held in Moscow in April 1952, representatives from business circles in eleven countries, including the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Italy, and West Germany, engaged in trade contacts with our delegation and signed trade agreements and contracts totaling more than 200 million US dollars. After the conference, the Japanese representatives attending the conference also signed a trade agreement with our country in Beijing. Since then, our country has successively signed trade agreements with the governments of Ceylon, Finland, Indonesia, Burma, and other countries, established trade relations with the government of Pakistan, consolidated the trade relations already established with the government of India, and signed a trade and transportation agreement between our country's Tibet region and India. In addition, we have established or developed trade relations with business circles in Sweden, Switzerland, Egypt, Chile, the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Italy, West Germany, and other countries. During this period, the trade volume of many capitalist countries with our country has also been continuously increasing. These facts show that, despite the US aggressive bloc's multifaceted obstruction and sabotage of trade relations between various countries and our country, due to our country's adherence to the policy of equality and mutual benefit in trade, and our unremitting efforts to develop international trade, and because business circles in capitalist countries deeply feel that severing economic ties with our country and the People's Democratic countries is not in line with their own interests, trade between our country and capitalist countries has still been able to achieve significant recovery and development under the "blockade and embargo."

    Our country is not only willing to develop trade relations with various countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, but also embodies the spirit of equality and mutual benefit in actual transactions. This is reflected in the fact that the commodities exchanged between our country and these countries are all what both sides need. There is no phenomenon of any one side forcing the trading partner to accept commodities it does not need, and there is no situation of any one side taking advantage of the other's difficulties to force it to accept harsh conditions. The prices set by both sides are fair and reasonable. This trade mainly takes the form of barter trade, which can eliminate the payment difficulties of both sides, especially the payment difficulties caused by the "dollar shortage" encountered by many capitalist countries when trading with the United States, which is greatly conducive to the development of normal trade between countries.

    The trade between our country and Ceylon is an example. Because Ceylon signed a five-year trade agreement with our country for rubber and rice, most of Ceylon's rubber can be sold at fair and relatively stable prices, thereby saving Ceylon's 300,000 rubber workers from the pain of unemployment and helping Ceylon solve the difficulty of rice shortage. At the same time, our country also obtained the rubber it needed.

    However, the US monopoly capitalist group is not reconciled to the failure of its "blockade and embargo" policy. It fears that the expansion of East-West trade will promote the relaxation of international tensions, thereby shaking its monopoly position in the capitalist world. US Assistant Secretary of State Robertson openly declared: "The opening of the Chinese market will prompt Japan and the United Kingdom to drift away from the United States and reduce the actual leadership role of the United States in the free world." It is precisely because of the development of this trade that the US aggressive bloc is doing everything possible to induce Ceylon to abolish the Sino-Ceylon trade agreement; and using the cessation of "aid" as pressure to prevent Indonesia from selling rubber to our country. In addition, in recent times, the US aggressive bloc has also instructed the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to intercept merchant ships of various countries at sea, attempting to obstruct normal shipping between various countries and our country.

    Obviously, the shameful and selfish goal of the US aggressive bloc will be completely defeated. Because these countries are increasingly aware that: with our country's large-scale economic construction and the improvement of the living standards of 600 million people, the types and output of our country's export goods are constantly increasing, and the import capacity of various machinery, equipment, raw materials, and daily necessities is also constantly expanding. Trading with such a Chinese market with enormous potential will greatly help their industrial production and increase the number of employed, as well as reduce sales difficulties. Ceylon Chamber of Commerce President Shen Nanayake recently stated: "We cannot allow any action to abolish trade with China. I see no benefit in exchanging the economic benefits we have already obtained from our trade with China for US Lend-Lease aid." Indonesian First Deputy Prime Minister Wang Su Ni Ge Luo also recently stated: "If the United States exerts pressure to prevent Indonesia from selling rubber to the People's Republic of China, Indonesia will not accept such pressure and will implement an independent foreign policy." Public opinion in Western European countries has also expressed one after another: they have the right to trade freely with any place, and the United States has no right to restrict their trade. It is precisely because of the increasing resistance and dissatisfaction of these countries towards the US aggressive bloc's obstruction of East-West trade, especially obstruction of trade with our country, that the US Senate Foreign Economic Committee—the Randall Commission—also helplessly admitted in a recent working report: "It seems that the world has reached the threshold of another increase in East-West trade."

    The facts of the past few years have proven that any government and people who love peace and are willing to establish trade relations with our country based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit are welcomed and supported by us. This not only conforms to the needs of our country's industrialization construction, but also conforms to the vital interests and wishes of millions of people around the world, and is conducive to the consolidation of lasting world peace. In the future, we will, as in the past, be willing to establish and develop normal trade relations with the governments and peoples of all foreign countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

    发展国际间正常的贸易关系
    平叔
    在我们与苏联及各人民民主国家日益加强经济合作、扩大贸易的同时，对于世界其他各国，不论其社会经济制度如何，也不论其和我国有无外交关系，我们都是愿意在平等互利的基础上，发展和扩大相互之间的经济合作和贸易往来的。因为，发展和扩大这种贸易往来，是有利于彼此间友谊的增进，各国人民生活水平的提高和世界和平事业的巩固的。
    美国侵略集团采取了敌视我国人民的“封锁禁运”政策，妨碍了国际间正常贸易的开展。这是美国垄断资本集团妄图统治世界的侵略政策的一部分。它妄图以此来窒杀我国和其它国家之间的经济来往；并利用其他国家在追随它的“封锁禁运”、失去东方的传统市场以后在经济上不能不更加依赖美国的情况，采用种种无耻手段来打击与排挤它的竞争者，以便进一步垄断整个资本主义世界的资源和市场。
    美国侵略集团的“封锁禁运”政策并没有得到预期的效果。在过去四年中，我国对外贸易的总值增加了五倍以上，和五十多个国家的政府或工商界人士发生了贸易关系。
    真正受到这种“封锁禁运”的损害的，倒是那些奉行美国侵略集团这一政策的国家。
    由于奉行美国侵略集团的“封锁禁运”政策，许多资本主义国家对我国及对各人民民主国家的贸易额大大缩减，使这些国家的经济不可避免地受到严重的损害。美国侵略集团不许这些国家以它们的工业品输往我国及各人民民主国家，换取它们所需要的农产品和原料；而把自己的农产品、原料及其他商品以高价向这些国家倾销；并想尽办法阻止这些国家的商品进入美国国内市场。这样，就不能不造成这些国家对美国贸易的长期的巨额的逆差，一九四六年至一九五三年的七年中，资本主义各国对美国的贸易逆差就达到五百亿美元的庞大数字。伴随着贸易逆差与收支逆差而来的，便是这些国家的工业生产不断下降，失业人数大量增加，劳动人民的生活状况日益恶化。例如，去年西欧十二个主要资本主义国家的全失业人数即比一九四八年增加了百分之四十五。
    对那些依靠原料输出为主要收入的国家，更受到美国侵略集团任意压低原料价格并倾销自己的剩余商品的残暴的掠夺。马来亚、泰国等东南亚国家，在被迫实行“封锁禁运”致使原料价格惨跌以及输出量下降之后，它们的对外贸易即由以往的出超变为巨额的入超，经济生活陷于恶劣的境地。去年马来亚的输出总值即比一九五一年减少百分之五十一点三，尽管马来亚竭力削减输入并采取其他措施，但仍然入超马来亚币三亿零七百余万元。至于日本所受到“封锁禁运”的损害尤其严重。日本工业所需要的煤、盐、铁砂、大豆等，过去大部分由我国输入，自从美国侵略集团强制实行“封锁禁运”并控制日本的对外贸易以后，日本便不得不以高价由美国输入这些商品，而这样就比由我国输入每年要多花二亿美元。
    这些情况不能不引起这些国家对于美国侵略集团这一政策的日益强烈的反对。资本主义各国广大人民从来就反对这种“封锁禁运”，要求扩大正常的国际贸易。资本主义各国工商界人士和有远见的政界人士也越来越频繁地要求恢复与发展和我国、苏联及各人民民主国家的贸易，以解除它们的经济困难。一九五二年四月在莫斯科举行的国际经济会议上，英、法、比、意、西德等十一国的工商界代表与我国代表团进行贸易接触，签订了总额二亿多美元的贸易协议和合同。会后，出席会议的日本代表又在北京和我国签订了贸易协议。从那时起，我国和锡兰、芬兰、印度尼西亚、缅甸等国政府陆续签订了贸易协定，和巴基斯坦政府建立了贸易关系，和印度政府巩固了早已建立的贸易关系，并签订我国西藏地方和印度之间的通商、交通协定。此外，还和瑞典、瑞士、埃及、智利、英、法、比、意、西德等国工商界建立或发展了通商的关系。在这一时期，许多资本主义国家对我国的贸易额也在不断增长。这些事实说明，尽管美国侵略集团多方阻挠与破坏各国和我国的贸易关系，但由于我国坚持平等互利的贸易政策，和对发展国际间的贸易作了不懈的努力，并由于资本主义各国的工商界深切感到断绝与我国及各人民民主国家的经济联系是不符合切身利益的，这就使我国和资本主义各国之间的贸易在“封锁禁运”的情况下仍能得到显著的恢复和发展。
    我国不但愿意和各国在平等互利的基础上发展贸易关系，并且在实际交易中也体现了平等互利的精神，这表现在我国和这些国家所交换的商品都是双方所需要的，这里没有任何一方强使贸易对方接受它所不需要的商品的现象，更没有任何一方利用对方的困难强使它接受苛刻条件的情形。双方所定的价格是公平合理的。这种贸易主要是采取以货易货的方式，这种方式可以免除双方的支付困难，特别是许多资本主义国家在和美国进行贸易时所遭遇的“美元短缺”所引起的支付困难，大大有利于发展各国间的正常贸易。
    我国和锡兰的贸易就是一个例子。由于锡兰和我国签订了橡胶与大米的五年贸易协定，使锡兰大部分橡胶能按公平的和相当稳定的价格出售，从而使锡兰三十万橡胶工人得以免受失业的痛苦，并且帮助锡兰解决了大米缺乏的困难。与此同时，我国也得到了自己所需要的橡胶。
    但是美国垄断资本集团并不甘心于它的“封锁禁运”政策的失败，它害怕东西方贸易的扩大将促使国际紧张局势的缓和，从而动摇它在资本主义世界的垄断地位。美国助理国务卿罗伯逊公然宣称：“中国市场的打开将促使日、英两国和美国疏远，并将减低美国在自由世界实际上的领导作用。”就是由于发展了这种贸易，美国侵略集团正千方百计地诱迫锡兰废除中、锡贸易协定；并以停止“援助”为压力，阻止印度尼西亚出售橡胶给我国。此外，在最近时期，美国侵略集团还指使蒋介石匪帮在海上拦劫各国商船，企图阻碍各国和我国的正常航运。
    显然，美国侵略集团这种可耻而自私的目的是会完全失败的。因为这些国家越来越认识到：随着我国大规模的经济建设与六万万人民生活水平的提高，我国出口物资的种类与产量正在不断增加，各种机械、器材、原料以及日用品的进口容量也在不断扩大，和这样一个具有巨大潜力的中国市场进行贸易，对于它们的工业生产与就业人数的增加，以及销售困难的减除都将有很大的帮助。锡兰商会主席沈纳那亚克最近表示：“我们不能容许任何废止与中国贸易的行动，我看不出以我们对中国贸易已经取得的经济利益去换取美国租借法案的援助有任何好处。”印度尼西亚政府第一副总理旺梭尼哥罗最近也表示：“如果美国施行压力来阻止印度尼西亚出售橡胶给中华人民共和国的话，印度尼西亚将不接受这样的压力而实行独立的外交政策。”西欧各国的公众舆论也纷纷表示：它们有权与任何地方任意进行贸易，而美国是没有权利来限制它们的贸易的。正是由于这些国家对于美国侵略集团阻碍东西方贸易特别是阻碍对我国的贸易的反抗与不满的日益增长，美国参议院对外经济委员会——朗戴尔委员会——在最近发表的一份工作报告中，也无可奈何地承认：“看来，世界已临到了东西方贸易再次增加的门阶。”
    几年来的事实证明，凡是爱好和平并愿意基于平等互利的原则和我国建立贸易关系的政府与人民，都受到我们的欢迎与支持。这不仅符合于我国工业化建设的需要，并且也符合于全世界千百万人民的切身利益和愿望，有助于世界持久和平的巩固。今后，我们仍然和过去一样，愿意在平等互利的基础上，和各外国的政府与人民建立并发展正常的贸易关系。
