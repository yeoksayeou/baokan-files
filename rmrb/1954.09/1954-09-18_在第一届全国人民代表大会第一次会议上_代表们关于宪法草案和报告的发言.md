At the First Session of the First National People's Congress, representatives delivered speeches on the draft constitution and report.

**Speech by Saifudin Representative**

Honorable Chairman, fellow representatives:

The draft constitution of the People's Republic of China fully guarantees the equal and free rights of China's ethnic minorities and their great development in politics, economy, and culture. It will enable all ethnic minorities to transition to a prosperous and happy socialist society together with the rest of the nation. We, the people of Xinjiang and their representatives, fully support the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft constitution, and we are determined to struggle for its realization.

The people of Xinjiang have experienced a history of painful national and feudal oppression and have fought bravely against national oppression. However, it was only under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao that national oppression was eliminated and national equality was implemented. This laid the foundation for the elimination of long-standing phenomena of national separatism and the realization of national unity. This national unity is developing and unbreakable. Since the liberation of Xinjiang, the backwardness and poverty of the various ethnic groups caused by the previous reactionary rule have undergone tremendous changes. Due to the completion of land reform and democratic reform, and the work of restoring and developing the national economy, Xinjiang's economy and culture have developed significantly, and the material and cultural lives of the various ethnic groups have improved greatly. Now, Xinjiang is implementing and will continue to implement regional ethnic autonomy. Through ethnic autonomy, national unity has been further strengthened, and the political enthusiasm and labor zeal of the various ethnic groups have been greatly enhanced, which will promote the development of political, economic, and cultural construction in the autonomous regions. Now, Xinjiang already has a good political foundation and a certain economic foundation for socialist construction and socialist transformation. Of course, Xinjiang still faces many difficulties in carrying out socialist construction and socialist transformation, but I believe these difficulties can be gradually overcome.

Building a prosperous and happy socialist society is not only the wish of the people of Xinjiang but has also become the actual struggle of the people of Xinjiang. In their new life, the people of Xinjiang have seen the bright future of the socialist society and their own ethnic development, and they feel infinitely excited and inspired. Based on their personal experience, the people of Xinjiang deeply understand that the acquisition of equal, free, and happy lives and the development of political, economic, and cultural undertakings are the result of the leadership of the great Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the result of being united in the great family of the motherland—freedom and equality, the result of the great help of the Han people, and also the result of the efforts of the ethnic minorities themselves.

I am fully convinced that under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, following the direction and path indicated by the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, the people of Xinjiang will definitely be able to transition to a prosperous and happy socialist society together with the people of the entire nation.

**Speech by Xu Guangping Representative**

Fellow representatives:

I am from a feudal family and was born in Guangdong, one of the earliest regions to suffer from imperialist aggression. I spent my childhood in humiliation and oppression and my adulthood in hardship and persecution. I never expected that in my old age, I would stand up with the people of the entire nation. Today, I am participating in the First Session of the First National People's Congress, which will solemnly adopt the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. The Communist Party saved me. The Communist Party also gave me glory. I am filled with tears of joy and excitement, and I am grateful beyond words. I believe that many of the representatives present must also share the same feelings.

Our constitution is written with the blood of countless martyrs. It consolidates the fruits of the Chinese people's revolution and is also our beacon as we advance towards the broad road of socialism. We will strive together under its brilliant light to complete the general tasks of the transitional period and build a prosperous and happy socialist society.

Chairman Mao instructs us: "The transformation of thought, especially the transformation of the thoughts of various intellectuals, is an important condition for thoroughly implementing democratic reforms and gradually implementing industrialization in all areas of our country." I think this is also the important task of intellectuals in the transitional period.

In the past five years, under the correct leadership and help of the Party, we intellectuals have achieved great success in transforming our thoughts. However, compared to the rapid development of the situation, I dare say that these achievements are not yet commensurate with the situation. The transitional period is a period of intense change, and the transformation of the thoughts of intellectuals must also keep pace with the changes and be carried out continuously. If we are satisfied with our own thought transformation and stagnate, we will eventually fall behind the situation and become the dregs of society. This is like a tree infested with pests that needs constant pruning and weeding, fertilization, and pest control to thrive and flourish; otherwise, it will inevitably wither and fall in the wind.

I often feel pain, feeling that someone like me, born into a feudal family, is full of flaws, and they can never be completely removed. But at the same time, I also feel the urgency of intensifying the transformation. Although flaws cannot be completely removed, as long as one is determined to do so, they will gradually decrease.

In recent years, my efforts in self-transformation have been far from sufficient. The Party and the people have cared for me, and the Party and the people have cultivated me. However, today, upon serious self-examination, I am truly ashamed!

I deeply feel that the biggest obstacle to the transformation of the thoughts of intellectuals is various forms of individualism and liberalism. Placing personal interests first and making collective interests serve personal interests is such a reversal of priorities. No matter how many times you say "thought transformation," it will not have much effect. Correcting the position of personal interests and collective interests and making personal interests serve collective interests is the fundamental issue for effective self-transformation.

Bourgeois liberalism is also a hindrance to our progress. We often say "follow the Communist Party of China," but in reality, we often maintain a distance from the Party. One of the main reasons for this "distance" is the decaying liberalism. We nod in agreement in front of others but do not speak up, and behind their backs, we gossip and spout nonsense. We think more about ourselves and less about the people, so how can we advance lightly and happily and sincerely follow the lead? How can we qualify as friends and assistants? We all come from the old society, and we must decisively abandon this decaying historical legacy of the old society.

I often think that society is advancing, and we must strive to transform ourselves. The transitional period is full of changes, and it does not allow us to stand still and remain unchanged. We have the general line as our beacon, the constitution as our compass, and the Communist Party as our reliable guide. The bright future of a happy and prosperous socialist society is ahead of us!

However, having a beacon, a compass, and a guide does not mean we have reached our destination. The road still needs us to walk. If you do not walk, you will only fall behind.

I firmly support our people's constitution. I believe that the best way to prove our sincere support for the constitution is to test whether we are truly transforming ourselves. I promise to work with all the representatives of the nation and the people to thoroughly transform ourselves and strive to implement the constitution.

**Speech by Shu Sheyu Representative**

Chairman, fellow representatives:

In the past two to three months, I have participated in many discussions and studies of the draft constitution in the literary and artistic circles. The draft constitution stipulates freedom of speech and publication. This has made the literary and artistic circles particularly excited. Writers love to talk, and if they cannot speak, they write. However, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, our mouths were gagged, and our pens were forced to stop. We even had to be careful when chatting, fearing that the walls had ears! We often ended up in prison for writing a letter. Many of us have suffered torture, and some have even lost their lives! At that time, the book censorship system brought us endless pain. Some writers' works, regardless of their content, were always banned. The names of these writers were the ones that the reactionary government least wanted to see. This evil system built a great wall between the people and the writers. It banned good books that spoke for the people while encouraging the publication of yellow and vulgar "works." It not only deprived us of our freedom of publication but also defiled literature!

Today, we have obtained the guarantee of freedom of speech and publication, how can we not be overjoyed beyond description! We must use all our abilities and enthusiasm to write more and better works to show our determination to support the constitution!

We also know that as long as we are active in creation and serve the people in the future, we will definitely receive more and greater encouragement and help than we have already received in the past five years. We are grateful for the stipulation in Article 95 of the draft constitution that encourages and helps literary and artistic creation! We vow to never allow the reactionary forces that have oppressed us for so many years to attempt a counter-revolutionary restoration! We will join the people of the entire nation to resolutely defend our revolutionary victories and the people's constitution!

When it comes to help, I would like to offer a suggestion: the greatest help we need today is to give us ample time to study, to experience life, and to write in peace. Of course, we should and are willing to participate in more social activities. However, due to past improper methods, we often end up busy all day, neglecting one thing for another. We hope that in the future, the leadership and society will pay attention to the fact that the primary task of writers is creation, and creation requires ample preparation time, writing time, and revision time. The leading organs should discuss and plan the social activities of writers, appropriately allocate them, and not let everyone work too hard or let social activities take up too much writing time. For example, if a writer has already been to the airport once in the morning, they should not be sent there again in the afternoon; everyone can take turns going. Regarding attending receptions, memorial meetings, welcome meetings, farewell meetings, etc., they should be properly arranged. Everyone should take turns, so that everyone can be active and everything can be done well. It is not very scientific to have the active elements worn out and not let them rest. Take listening to reports as an example; the notice should specify what the report is about, and those who have already listened to it can choose not to participate. However, the notice often only says "please attend," without mentioning anything else. Therefore, I often listen to the same content of the report three times, at least wasting two and a half days of writing time. I also often receive three or four notices for meetings that start at the same time, all saying "please attend," making me helpless. Yes, with proper allocation, writers can both not disrupt their study and writing plans and actively participate in social activities, achieving both.

We support the draft constitution and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report, and we are convinced that our constitution will definitely work! However, we also know that many of our past works lacked precise division of labor and did not establish a good scientific work system, so we often grabbed things in a mess and did them poorly. This will bring some difficulties to the implementation of the constitution. To welcome the constitution and to ensure its smooth implementation, we should first cultivate the spirit and habit of law-abiding in everything being orderly, absolutely not allowing things to be done casually and in a mess. Although the requirements we put forward are small, comparing small to big, we hope: since there is a constitution, everything must be done in an orderly and planned manner, with appropriate division of labor and reasonable arrangements, without any chaos or disorder! Comrades, let us all, with scientific work methods and law-abiding spirit, build a prosperous and happy socialist society under the bright light of the people's constitution as soon as possible!

**Speech by Hu Yaobang Representative**

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully support the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft constitution. This constitution guarantees the freedom and happiness that our country's youth have already obtained and illuminates their even brighter future.

In the old China, the reactionaries cruelly persecuted the youth. The political rights of the youth were stripped away, their creative talents were destroyed, and their physical and mental health were harmed. In the new China, our country regards the youth as its future and has given the youth political, economic, labor, and educational rights, caring for the youth from all aspects and cultivating the youth. Our country has given the right to vote and be elected to youth who are eighteen years old and above, enabling nearly eighty million youth to learn to manage national affairs in actual life. Our country has established tens of thousands of schools and many other cultural and educational institutions for the youth, enabling nearly sixty million students and more than two million young workers and peasants to study in various levels of schools and various part-time schools. Our country has created labor conditions for the youth from all aspects, enabling one million youth to work in factories, mines, enterprises, and state organs, and ten million peasant youth to produce happily on their own land. Our country continuously increases health and sports facilities, enabling the physical strength of the broad masses of youth to rapidly increase. Due to the care of the state, Chinese youth have obtained comprehensive development that has never been seen in history. Chinese youth are filled with boundless love for the great Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao.

The constitution guides our people to struggle for the construction of socialism. This is a very arduous and complex task. The special care of the state for the youth as embodied in the constitution is a sincere hope that the youth will undertake and develop this great cause. Chinese youth must always think of the great responsibility in front of them and be determined to contribute their greatest strength to the motherland. The broad masses of youth understand their responsibilities and are brave and active on all fronts, making valuable contributions to the country. Among them, tens of thousands of labor models and advanced individuals have emerged, setting good examples for the youth of the new China.

However, our work still has shortcomings. We have not paid enough attention to the ideological problems among the youth, and we have done a poor job of socialist education among the broad masses of youth. We have not advocated hard work enough. Due to the influence of the remnants of the old society and the corruption of bourgeois ideology, some youth have developed a sense of dependence, unwilling to work hard, unwilling to improve, seeking comfort, and pursuing personal enjoyment. We have not paid enough attention to the lack of discipline in some schools and have not seriously assisted school administrators and teachers in educating and punishing those who violate discipline, which is harmful to the youth. We have not been vigilant against the evil deeds of hidden counter-revolutionaries and hooligans who poison the youth, and we have not conducted a resolute and serious struggle against them, allowing these bad elements to lead some backward youth to become corrupt and do things that harm the interests of the people. We must face and overcome these shortcomings and strive to organize and unite the broad masses of youth to struggle for the construction of socialism.

The constitution is a lively textbook for Chinese youth, and we will draw wisdom and strength from it. We must make the youth know that our martyrs have given their blood to the cause of people's liberation, and we of this generation must build the motherland into a great socialist country with heroic labor. We must strive to overcome the decadent idea of looking down on labor among the youth. We must mobilize the youth to master the scientific and technological knowledge necessary for the construction of the motherland with tenacious learning. We must call on the youth to temper themselves into brave, wise, strong, and hardworking individuals. We must strive to make the youth obey discipline and the law everywhere and fight resolutely against any behavior that harms the interests of the motherland at all times. We must make the youth understand that defending the motherland is first and foremost the sacred duty of the youth. All members of the Communist Youth League must play a model and leading role in all these struggles. I believe that the Chinese youth, guided by the great Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, will contribute their full strength to the great and glorious cause of the motherland!

**Speech by Peng Zhen Representative**

Fellow representatives:

I fully support the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China proposed by the Central People's Government and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on this draft constitution.

This draft constitution realistically summarizes the experience of the people's revolutionary struggle in our country, the experience of state-building, and expresses the long-term aspirations of the people of our country. It not only affirms in legal form the achievements that the people of our country have already obtained but also clearly stipulates the goals and paths for the people of our country to carry out socialist construction and socialist transformation. It is the most concentrated expression of the interests and will of the people of all ethnic groups in our country. I propose that our congress adopt it and call on the people of the entire nation to unanimously struggle for its complete realization.

Our constitution is of the socialist type and is different from the bourgeois type. It is completely for the people, protecting the rights and legitimate interests of the people, and is a weapon for socialist construction and socialist transformation. Every citizen of the People's Republic of China, regardless of their ethnicity, race, gender, occupation, social origin, whether they believe in religion or what religion they believe in, and whether they are or are not members of the Communist Party, state officials, or have high positions or great merits, should unexceptionally observe it.

The slogan "equality before the law" cannot be implemented in capitalist countries. There, the laborers cannot achieve actual equality with the bourgeoisie in legal status, so this slogan is only a lie used by the bourgeoisie to deceive and numb the laborers, a sham "democracy." In our country, it is completely different. Our country is a people's democratic country led by the working class. All our citizens can and must be equal before the law. Everyone observes the law, and everyone is equal before the law, which should be and must be the actual actions of all people, all state officials, and all state organs. In our country, it is not allowed to have actions that do not match words, and it is not allowed to have any privileged individuals above the law.

To fully realize our constitution, we must carry out serious and complex struggles from all aspects. We must be vigilant and oppose the sabotage activities of imperialism and the remnants of domestic counter-revolutionaries, and we must oppose the sabotage activities of all elements that resist socialist transformation. We must struggle against all illegal phenomena among the people and punish all illegal and criminal elements according to the law. This is not only the responsibility of the public security organs, the people's procuratorates, and the people's courts but also the responsibility of the people. The people are the reliance of the specialized organs, and the specialized organs are the weapons of the people. The two must be closely combined to consolidate the legal system of our country and maintain the implementation of the constitution and the law.

To ensure the smooth implementation of the constitution and maintain the legal system of the state, we must also criticize various erroneous ideas.

Now there are some people who think that they have made some "contributions" or "suffered" in the past, and they think that the Party and the state should allow them to be above the law and do as they please. They do not understand that the heroes of the people should be humble and law-abiding, and work hard as faithful servants of the people, striving for more contributions and greater glory. In terms of the law, they should not ask for any special treatment. The state should not and should not tolerate any illegal and criminal acts, regardless of their past merits. This idea of special treatment for heroes is essentially a reflection of the feudal landlord and feudal monarch's idea of riding on the heads of the people, an idea that corrupts our cadres, an idea that destroys our cadres, and even an idea that can develop into an idea that destroys our country and our Party. We must severely criticize and overcome it.

Among some state officials, there is also an idea that the law is only for the common people or only for "small people," while "big officials" and "big people" only need to pay attention to the implementation of the Party and state policies, and whether they observe the law is unimportant. This idea is also completely wrong. Our country's law is not something else; it is the codification of policies that have been or are being implemented. To go against the law is to go against the policies. Our cadres are the servants and leaders of the people. The state's requirements for cadres should be higher than those for ordinary citizens in all aspects. Cadres must not only implement policies, observe political discipline, and work discipline but must also strictly observe the laws of the state and become models of law-abiding. If a cadre does not observe the law himself, how can he require the people to observe the law? How can he lead the people to struggle against illegal phenomena and struggle to implement the policies of the Party and the state? It must be clear that the state cannot tolerate any illegal and criminal acts, regardless of their position.

There are also some Communist Party members who think that since the Communist Party is the leader of the state, they only need to observe the Party's discipline, and it seems that they can be a little careless about observing the state's laws. This idea is also wrong and dangerous. They do not know that the Party's discipline and the state's laws are consistent. The Communist Party's requirements for a Party member are much stricter and higher than the state's requirements for a citizen. One of the duties of a Communist Party member is to observe the state's laws in a model manner. To violate the national law is to violate the Party's discipline and harm the interests of the Party. Therefore, the Communist Party of China clearly stipulates: Communist Party members who receive criminal penalties for violating the national law will be expelled from the Party. Communist Party members must not have any exceptions or special treatments in observing the constitution and the law. If they insist on having them, then they must be models of law-abiding and unite the masses to struggle for the implementation of the constitution and various laws.

There are also some workers and peasants who think that since the people have become the masters of the state, they do not need to observe any laws. This idea is also wrong. The state is ours, and the laws of the state are ours. Since we have become the masters of the state, can we not observe the laws of our own state? On the contrary, we should strictly observe them. The constitution and the law are formulated by our people through their representatives and express the will of our people, protect the interests of our people, and are our weapons against enemies and bad elements. Why should we not observe them and use them? If we ourselves do not observe them and use them, then who will observe them and use them?

Obviously, the above various erroneous ideas are all contrary to the spirit of our draft constitution and are obstacles to the smooth implementation of the constitution. We must criticize and overcome these erroneous ideas.

In addition, there are some people who do not seem to ask for any special treatment on the surface, but they always want to enjoy more rights and perform fewer duties, or even only pursue the rights granted by the law and do not perform the duties stipulated by the law. This is also wrong. According to our constitution, citizens are equal in enjoying rights and performing duties. Everyone has rights to enjoy and duties to perform. Not performing duties is a kind of special treatment, and our constitution does not recognize this kind of special treatment. The idea of "only enjoying rights and not performing duties" is actually an idea of exploiting and harming the interests of the majority of the people to satisfy personal interests, an idea of special treatment, and it is contrary to the spirit of our draft constitution. We must also severely criticize and overcome this idea.

Can the state organs have any special treatment in observing the law? No. According to our draft constitution, not only the state organ officials and state administrative organs must strictly observe the constitution and the law, but the state procuratorial and judicial organs must also strictly observe the constitution and the law. The state's power organs, up to the National People's Congress, must also strictly observe the constitution and the law. All ideas that state organs can violate the law are actually the reactionary ruling class's idea of "allowing the officials to set fires but not allowing the common people to light lamps," which is completely incompatible with the spirit of our draft constitution. We must oppose it.

Our constitution is about to be adopted and promulgated. All citizens of our country and all state organs, democratic parties, and people's organizations must strictly observe the constitution and use the standards stipulated by the constitution to examine our thoughts and actions and struggle against all illegal phenomena. Only in this way can we, with the six hundred million people united as one, march in unison and advance step by step towards a prosperous and happy socialist society along the path planned by our constitution.

**Speech by Shen Junru Representative**

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I am participating in this meeting as a people's representative, discussing and adopting the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. I deeply feel the honor of our mission and the importance of our responsibility.

Adopting this constitution is to declare to the world that six hundred million Chinese people have voluntarily and unanimously decided to take the path they have chosen. This is not the path of feudalism, nor is it the path of capitalism and imperialism. Those paths are all dead ends. The path we want to take is the only bright and happy path, the path of socialism.

Taking this path requires steady progress. We must complete socialist construction and socialist transformation to eliminate exploitation and poverty and transition to a socialist society. Our descendants will live a life of prosperity, happiness, peace, and joy that is incomparable to the past.

Fellow representatives! This constitution is not easily obtained. It is the result of the blood and sweat of countless patriots over more than a hundred years. Implementing this constitution is also not an easy task. It requires the people of the entire nation to be more united and struggle and work.

Fellow representatives! We must not forget: eight million people in Taiwan have not yet been liberated, and the Chiang Kai-shek gang has not yet been completely eliminated. We must not forget: the war-mongering imperialists are still plotting wars of aggression. We must also not forget: the classes that have been or will be eliminated are not willing to be eliminated. Some of them will try to stage a comeback, and some will resist. We must be vigilant against these internal and external enemies at all times.

The adoption of the constitution does not mean that everything has changed. The most important thing is to transform all of us who have grown up in the old society. I think that all kinds of intellectuals, especially state officials, must always remember what Chairman Mao said in 1949: "With the people's state, the people have the opportunity to educate and transform themselves on a national scale and in a comprehensive manner, to get rid of the influence of internal and external reactionaries... to transform the bad habits and bad thoughts they have acquired from the old society, so as not to go astray on the wrong path indicated by the reactionaries, and to continue to advance towards a socialist society and a communist society."

I am a legal worker of the people, and I will continue to work with the broad masses of the people to spare no effort to defend the constitution and work seriously and actively for its implementation. In the past five years, various levels of people's courts under the leadership of the people's government have handled a large number of criminal and civil cases, ensuring the completion of various movements during the recovery period and the smooth progress of national economic construction. However, various levels of people's courts have made some mistakes and shortcomings in performing the state's judicial duties. The most notable is the shortcomings and errors caused by the old legal concepts and old judicial style in judicial work. Although these concepts and styles have been severely struck down in the judicial reform movement, they still need to be further eradicated. Some judicial personnel, in handling cases, rely only on subjective guesses and lack a democratic style, resulting in wrong judgments in individual cases and infringing upon the democratic rights of the people. This is incompatible with the requirements revealed by the constitution. At present, the Supreme People's Court and the Ministry of Justice are continuing to combine the democratic system construction of the courts to educate the judicial personnel of the courts at all levels in the country on democratic style and law-abiding spirit. I believe that the people's courts at all levels in the country will be able to quickly and seriously improve the work situation under the supervision of the people and adapt to the actual needs after the promulgation of the constitution.

Fellow representatives! I fully support Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China and propose that all representatives unanimously vote to adopt the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. I am determined to work even harder to implement this constitution and make our great motherland smoothly transition to a socialist society.

**Speech by Li Shunda Representative**

Since the draft constitution was promulgated, I have listened to four reports and participated in thirteen discussions, each time clearer than the last. Especially after listening to Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report, I felt even more intimately that our draft constitution, every word and every sentence, is in line with our wishes. This is a people's constitution that our country has never had before, and I am very satisfied and fully support it.

When we discussed the draft constitution in the village, everyone especially liked that the constitution consolidates our revolutionary achievements. Everyone recalled the past, before the war of resistance, they suffered from the oppression of the landlords, farmers had no right to speak, not to mention coming to Beijing, they couldn't even enter the village office. In our entire village of twenty households, seventeen rented land from the landlords. My family of six worked a year, after paying rent, we couldn't even have a full meal. The landlord's livestock ate four or five pounds of feed every day, while a person in my family could only eat half a pound of grain. After the war of resistance, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the farmers stood up, and their lives improved. Laboring people can manage national affairs. As for me, I am a representative of the county, provincial, and national people's congresses, and this time I was also elected as a representative of the first National People's Congress. Before the war, our entire county only had one primary school, now there are four primary schools and six village schools, most young and middle-aged people can read and write. There are also clinics, midwifery stations, telephones, and radios. Now our constitution has consolidated these revolutionary achievements, which not only guarantees that we will not suffer again but also guarantees that we will become happier and happier.

At the same time, everyone is most satisfied with: the draft constitution affirms that we will take the path of mutual aid and cooperation. Our village responded to Chairman Mao's call in 1943 to organize a mutual aid group. In December 1951, a cooperative for agricultural, forestry, and livestock production was established on the basis of the mutual aid group. In the past two years, it has developed from twenty-six households to two hundred and three households. Our township is in the Taihang Mountains, with thin soil and many rocks, with less than two mu of land per person. Before the organization, each mu of land could only produce one hundred and eighty jin of grain. After the organization, the yield increased year by year, and now each mu can produce more than one thousand one hundred jin, with an average of three hundred and fifty jin of grain, an increase of ninety-four percent. In the past two years, our cooperative has planted six hundred mu of trees on barren mountains and planted more than two thousand fruit trees, and raised more than seven hundred sheep. Our production and income are increasing year by year, and our lives are improving year by year. We are all looking forward to the arrival of the socialist society.

After the promulgation of the draft constitution, our confidence in building a socialist society has been strengthened. At the township people's congress meeting, we discussed the fifteen-year plan for agricultural, forestry, and livestock production construction in the entire township. After the implementation of this plan, each person can have an average income of more than three thousand jin of grain per year. This happy prospect constantly inspires each of us. Recently, I also heard that some areas in our country have suffered from floods, and to support the fellow villagers in the disaster areas, everyone's production enthusiasm is even greater. This year, our cooperative's crops are growing very well, and we are confident in completing the plan of increasing fifty-three jin of grain per mu.

The constitution stipulates that the state will gradually complete the socialist transformation of agriculture. We in Xigou Township are very confident in completing this glorious task. But I feel that my knowledge and experience are not enough, and there are still many shortcomings in my work. Therefore, I must humbly learn from labor models from all over the country and seriously learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. We know that to realize socialist construction, we must rely on the leadership of the working class, consolidate the alliance between workers and peasants, support socialist industrialization, further consolidate the people's democratic system, actively support the People's Liberation Army to liberate Taiwan, and defend the safety of our motherland. We farmers must struggle for the realization of these tasks.

**Speech by Cai Chang Representative**

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I wholeheartedly agree with and enthusiastically support the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft constitution. Since the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China was promulgated, in the past three months, the broad masses of women have seriously studied and enthusiastically discussed the draft constitution. Everyone unanimously agrees that the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China is the fruit of the people's revolution in our country, a summary of the new victories in politics and economy since the founding of the People's Republic of China. It reflects the fundamental requirements and common aspirations of the people to build a socialist society during the transitional period. For women, the draft constitution not only affirms the rights that women in our country have already obtained in the past five years but also points out the fundamental way to further guarantee gender equality and protect the rights of women and children. Women all over the country are excited and enthusiastically support it, and are determined to struggle for the realization and defense of the constitution.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the status of women in the old society of being oppressed and enslaved has been fundamentally changed. Women, like men, have become the masters of the state and enjoy equal rights in politics, economy, and culture. This has greatly inspired women's love for the motherland and their enthusiasm and initiative to participate in the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, social reform, and national construction. In the past five years, the number of women participating in socialist industrial construction has increased significantly. In 1953, the number of female workers in state-owned and joint-venture enterprises nationwide increased by 52% compared to 1951. The principle of equal pay for equal work has been basically implemented, and the labor insurance regulations are also being implemented within the specified scope. In the countryside, a large number of women have participated in the agricultural production movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation, increasing the contributions of rural women to production. Women have also widely participated in various national construction and social activities. They can study seriously and do their work well. In this national election movement, women who were elected as people's representatives account for an average of 17.31% of the total number of representatives. In various levels of people's congresses and various levels of people's governments, there are also many women participating and taking on responsible work. In schools, the number of female students is increasing year by year, and the number of daughters of laboring people entering school is particularly notable. After the propaganda and implementation of the Marriage Law, democratic and harmonious families that are united in production have emerged, improving the status of women in the family, and establishing a new trend of mutual respect between husbands and wives, and between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law. On various work posts and in all families, many women cadres and women labor models who love the motherland, love socialism, work hard in production, and have influence among the masses have emerged, setting a good example for the broad masses of women to participate in the construction of the motherland.

In the study and discussion of the draft constitution, we women have also fully realized that to achieve complete gender equality, we must go through arduous and complex work, because there are still many obstacles and difficulties in society and within women themselves. For this, we women must continue to raise our patriotic and socialist consciousness, overcome feudal remnants and bourgeois ideas, strive to learn and improve our production and work abilities, enthusiastically respond to the motherland's call, actively participate in the socialist construction work of the motherland, and strive to exercise the various rights granted to women by the constitution.

The era of enslaving women is forever gone. The Constitution of the People's Republic of China illuminates the path for us to socialism and the path for women's complete liberation. Let us women of the entire nation unite closely around the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, and strive for the implementation of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, for the gradual transition to a socialist society, and for the complete liberation of women!

**Speech by Panchen Erdeni Qigyiangzang Representative**

Chairman, fellow representatives:

This time, I, along with the Dalai Lama and other representatives, came to our great capital Beijing to participate in the first session of the first National People's Congress of our country and discuss and adopt the Constitution of the People's Republic of China with representatives of various brotherly ethnic groups. This is the first time in the history of our country, and I feel extremely honored and excited to be able to attend such a meeting of great historical significance.

The draft constitution of the People's Republic of China, after repeated study and discussion, I believe is completely correct and fully represents the interests and common aspirations of the people of all ethnic groups in our country. Only such a constitution can truly protect the equal rights of ethnic minorities; only such a constitution can consolidate the great victory of the people's revolution in our country; only such a constitution can lead the people of all ethnic groups in our country to firmly advance towards the happy road of socialism. Therefore, I fully agree with the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China and express my heartfelt support.

The great Communist Party of China and the beloved leader of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao, led the people of our country to achieve the great victory of the people's revolution, making Tibet achieve peaceful liberation. The Tibetan people have forever broken free from the shackles of imperialism and returned to the warm embrace of our friendly and harmonious family of the motherland. In the past three years, under the wise leadership and loving care of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, Tibet's politics, economy, and culture have all made significant achievements. Religious freedom has been well protected, and customs and habits have been well respected. In terms of economy and culture, there have been new developments, such as issuing interest-free agricultural and pastoral loans, building water conservancy projects, relieving disaster-stricken people, improving the lives of the people, establishing hospitals to provide free medical treatment to the people, reducing the suffering of diseases, and setting up primary schools to provide good opportunities for Tibetan children to enter school. Especially in terms of unity, the unity within the Tibetan nationality and the unity between the Tibetan nationality and various brotherly ethnic groups have been strengthened. The living facts of the past three years have made us deeply feel that the national policy of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao is great and correct, and that the people of all ethnic groups in our country love and help the Tibetan people. With the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao and the help and cooperation of various brotherly ethnic groups, the Tibetan people can enjoy the warmth of the family of the motherland and truly break free from the deception and enslavement of imperialism, and politics, economy, and culture can develop. Here, I would like to express my highest respect to the great Communist Party of China and the savior of the people of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao.

Chairman, fellow representatives! The Tibetan nationality and the Tibetan people have suffered long-term aggression and oppression from imperialism in the past. The Tibetan people have seen through the ugly face of imperialism and resolutely oppose the plots and sabotage of imperialism. The Tibetan people who have returned to the family of the motherland love our great motherland even more and firmly believe in the leadership of the Central People's Government. We sincerely hope that our motherland will become stronger and stronger. We deeply know that a strong and prosperous motherland will definitely bring endless light and happiness to the Tibetan people. We will forever unite around the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, together with the Dalai Lama, with our actual actions, continue to strengthen and consolidate the unity within the Tibetan nationality and the unity between the Tibetan nationality and various brotherly ethnic groups, and together with the personnel of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet and all the Tibetan people, more enthusiastically love the motherland, build the family of the motherland, consolidate national defense, be vigilant against the plots and sabotage of imperialism at all times, and strive to fully implement the peace agreement, abide by the people's constitution, and build a prosperous and new Tibet!

I wish all representatives good health!

I wish the conference a complete success!

**Speech by Liu Lanqi Representative**

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I am an ordinary primary school teacher, and this time I was elected as a representative of the first National People's Congress to come to Beijing to attend the meeting. The more I think about it, the happier I feel, and I don't know what words to express my excitement. First of all, I think of: if it weren't for the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao leading the people's revolution to achieve victory and establishing a people's democratic regime, there would be no such happy day.

In the old society under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, education was not valued, and children did not receive the care they deserved. Teachers all thought that teaching was a dead-end job, and teaching primary school was even more hopeless. Female teachers were even more places to suffer. I have been teaching for nearly thirty years. Although I love children and love primary school education work, at that time, there was only suffering and humiliation, and I thought my life was over. But in the new China, the Communist Party of China and the people's government especially value people's education and especially care for children. We primary school teachers, under the continuous education and care of the Party and the government, have improved our political status, secured our lives, and continuously improved our political awareness. There are many primary school teachers among the representatives of local people's congresses at all levels. Today, this ordinary primary school teacher is actually sitting in this solemn and grand meeting to participate in the formulation of the constitution, which shows that primary school education in our country has become a glorious career, and it is truly an honor to be a people's primary school teacher. Therefore, I love children even more and love my primary school education work!

The constitution records the fruits of our people's revolutionary victory and the wishes of the people, and it also makes good provisions for people's education. I enthusiastically support this people's constitution.

Based on the spirit of the constitution, let's examine our primary school education work. We cannot deny that there are some shortcomings and biases in our primary school education. For example, the draft constitution clearly states: "Labor is the glorious duty of all citizens of the People's Republic of China who have the ability to work." "Citizens of the People's Republic of China have the right to work." But in our primary school education, there is a serious bias towards neglecting labor education. Some graduates of primary schools who cannot go to higher education think they have no future and do not want to engage in agricultural and industrial production labor. This bias towards neglecting labor is essentially a bourgeois exploitative ideology.

The purpose and task of primary school education are to educate and cultivate our next generation to become the new force for building a socialist society. Every citizen in a socialist society must recognize that labor is a glorious duty and a right. Therefore, in the future, primary school education must seriously strengthen labor education to embody the true spirit and essence of the people's constitution.

In primary schools, carrying out socialist ideological education, especially labor education, the key is to overcome the bourgeois exploitative ideology of neglecting labor among primary school teachers and gradually establish a socialist educational ideology of labor. This requires strengthening the ideological transformation and professional learning of primary school teachers, strengthening the education, training, and ideological leadership of primary school principals and teaching directors.

Finally, the constitution is about to be adopted and promulgated, which requires me to strictly, together with all primary school teachers in the country, work hard, improve teaching quality, examine, criticize, and eliminate bourgeois educational ideas, gradually establish socialist educational ideas, cultivate citizens of a socialist society, and implement and support the constitution.

**Speech by Zhu Futan Representative**

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I am a medical worker in Beijing, a pediatrician, and today I am honored to participate in this conference.

After listening to Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft constitution, I feel that the draft constitution is the fruit of the great Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao's thirty-year leadership of the people of the entire nation in arduous struggles and is also the goal of struggle for the people of the entire nation to gradually complete the general tasks of the state in the transitional period. It truly represents the common will of the people of the entire nation, and I fully agree with and enthusiastically support this draft constitution.

The content of the draft constitution has given us medical workers great encouragement. Before liberation, under the triple oppression of feudalism, imperialism, and bureaucratic capitalism, it was not even possible to talk about health facilities. Even if there were some medical institutions, they were only for a very small number of people. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the broad masses of workers and cadres have enjoyed the benefits of labor insurance and free medical treatment. Now the draft constitution also stipulates that laborers can receive material assistance when they are old, sick, or lose the ability to work. The state will establish social insurance, social relief, and public health undertakings and gradually expand these facilities. The draft constitution also stipulates that the state will gradually expand the material conditions for the rest and recuperation of laborers. These facilities will undoubtedly further improve the happy life of the laboring people of the entire nation.

The draft constitution specially stipulates that mothers and children are protected by the state. Only a people's democratic country and a socialist country can do this. Before liberation, the infant mortality rate in our country was extremely high, reaching more than 200 per thousand, and the lives of mothers were not guaranteed. In the past few years, the people's government has set up many maternal and child health undertakings, trained and transformed more than twenty thousand midwives, and set up more than ten thousand kindergartens. The mortality rate of mothers and infants has been greatly reduced. In some ethnic minority areas, the phenomenon of population decline in the past has been reversed. From now on, the children of laboring people will forever enjoy a healthy and happy life.

The draft constitution's attention to the health industry, education work, and scientific research work has greatly inspired the enthusiasm and creativity of us medical workers. Just take my personal experience as an example. In the past, under the reactionary rule, if we wanted to set up a hospital and do some medical research, there was no one to support us. Now it is completely different. As early as the autumn of 1951, the Beijing Municipal People's Government, in order to care for the children of the capital, planned a large-scale children's hospital with educational facilities. Near this hospital, a piece of land has been reserved to set up a children's health research institute. These are things that we could not even dream of in the past, but now, these concrete facts have deeply moved me, making me feel that being a medical worker in a new China and having such a good opportunity to participate in the construction of the motherland is the greatest honor!

The health industry of the new China has definite achievements, but it also has shortcomings. First of all, our medical work, the quality is not good enough, and it is far from meeting the needs of the people. On the one hand, it is due to the fact that some workers have individualism and bureaucratism, lacking a high sense of responsibility and sympathy for the patients, and these medical workers must strengthen political and ideological leadership. On the other hand, the technical level of general cadres is not high enough, and business learning should be strengthened. Some medical workers who do leadership work should improve their leadership methods and put their main energy into the work of cultivating cadres.

As for medical and scientific research work, we have also done very little. We must absorb the achievements of medicine from various countries, especially the advanced medicine of the Soviet Union, to improve our medical level and better serve the people. We must also implement the spirit of patriotism and grasp the principle of combining theory with practice. Therefore, Western medicine must respond to Chairman Mao's call, thoroughly correct sectarianism, and seriously and humbly learn from traditional Chinese medicine. We must also conduct extensive and in-depth research on the essence of traditional Chinese medicine and pharmacology. I believe that after the close unity of Chinese and Western medicine, we will definitely develop and carry forward the cultural heritage of our motherland, establish a new Chinese medical system that is unified, has modern scientific characteristics, and has national characteristics. At the same time, to make medical and scientific research work and national economic construction work well together, we must pay attention to the actual problems of industrial and mining hygiene and the serious local endemic diseases in rural areas.

I am determined to use my actual actions to support the constitution formulated by our people. We medical workers must unite well, improve work quality, and learn the advanced medical treatment, prevention, medical education, and medical research systems and methods of the Soviet Union well, and do a good job in our people's hospitals, medical colleges, and other health undertakings.

Finally, we medical workers must always be ready to use all our strength to support the struggle to liberate Taiwan, until the compatriots in Taiwan who are suffering in water and fire and the medical workers in Taiwan can enjoy freedom, happiness, and peace like us.

**Speech by Chen Chutong Representative**

The draft constitution before us has been discussed for nearly six months by various democratic parties, people's organizations, democratic classes, and the broad masses of the people of the entire nation, and the Constitution Drafting Committee has considered the opinions of all parties and made necessary revisions. Comrade Liu Shaoqi has also made a detailed report on this draft constitution, explaining its basic content. I deeply believe that the first session of the first National People's Congress will solemnly and unanimously adopt this constitution of our people, which is a historic event.

This constitution represents the will of the six hundred million people led by the Chinese working class, consolidates the great achievements of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, reflects the common aspirations of the broad masses to build socialism, affirms the general tasks of the state in the transitional period, and is a clear guide for the Chinese people to successfully transition to a socialist society through a peaceful path.

This constitution was written under the personal leadership and participation of Chairman Mao and is completely based on reality, so it is in line with the specific situation of China, a shining example of combining principles and flexibility, and a concrete embodiment of the great thought of Mao Zedong. I wholeheartedly support this great constitution and am willing to struggle for its complete realization.

The significance of this constitution is limitless, and its content is limitless. To enable the people of the entire nation to have a deeper understanding of the great significance and rich content of our constitution, to enable the people of the entire nation to clearly understand the direction and path that our country should take, and also to enable this constitution to be implemented and executed in all aspects, I suggest that after the promulgation of the constitution, a wide-ranging propaganda and regular learning should be carried out throughout the country. This is because the road to building a socialist society as stipulated by the constitution is a new road for the people of the entire nation. This road is just beginning and has not yet accumulated enough experience, so we must strive to learn, learn humbly, learn comprehensively, and learn earnestly. Only by strengthening propaganda and learning can everyone understand and understand, and the people of the entire nation can follow the road indicated by the constitution and walk more smoothly and implement it more thoroughly.

Next, to thoroughly implement the constitution, the people of the entire nation must also use the weapons of criticism and self-criticism to transform themselves, establish a law-abiding spirit. The draft constitution, Article 100, stipulates: "Citizens of the People's Republic of China must observe the constitution and the law, observe labor discipline, observe public order, and respect social ethics." Only when the people of the entire nation understand and observe the law and do so unanimously, can the cause of building socialism gain the great guarantee of victory.

In the past five years, the people of the entire nation and state officials have been loyal to the country, diligent, and hardworking, and have achieved great achievements in all fields. This is undeniable. However, we do not hide the fact that there are still shortcomings in the work, and there have been phenomena of bureaucratism, commandism, and some violations of laws and disciplines. According to Chairman Mao's instructions at the fourth session of the first National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, these bad phenomena have been basically overcome. This does not mean that they will not happen again. Now, Articles 17 and 18 of the draft constitution have summarized Chairman Mao's correct instructions, and in the future, we must act according to Chairman Mao's instructions and the provisions of the constitution; at the same time, we also hope that our procuratorial organs can exercise their procuratorial powers in earnest, so that the constitution and laws of our country can be observed by all state organs, state cadres, and all citizens.

However, relying only on the procuratorial organs is not enough. We must also rely on the supervision of the broad masses. Articles 17 and 97 of the draft constitution have clearly stipulated the right to supervision and the right to complaint of the people. The people of the entire nation should correctly exercise the right to supervision and the right to complaint, so as to be able to overcome the phenomena of bureaucratism, commandism, and violations of laws and disciplines.

Chairman Mao said: "If these diseases are all removed, our state planning construction will definitely succeed, the people's democratic system will definitely develop, the plots of imperialism will definitely fail, and we will definitely achieve complete victory!"

Let us cheer for the thorough implementation of the constitution and for the complete victory of socialism!

Finally, defending the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and security of the state is the sacred task of the Chinese people. This sacred task has been clearly stipulated in Article 20 of the draft constitution. Taiwan is a province of China, Taiwan is the territory of China, and Taiwan is an inseparable part of the People's Republic of China. However, Taiwan is still occupied by the traitorous group of Chiang Kai-shek under the protection of American imperialists. The people of the entire nation have solemnly declared: the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan. We must fulfill this solemn declaration, we must implement the sacred task stipulated in the constitution, and we must resolutely struggle for the liberation of Taiwan.

**Speech by Zhang Jingwu Representative**

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully support the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft constitution. Based on my experience working in the Tibet region, I have proven that the national policy of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao is completely correct. The general tasks of the state in the transitional period stipulated in the draft constitution are completely in line with the development prospects of the various ethnic minorities in our country. This constitution is based on the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held in 1949 and is the development of the Common Program. The agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet signed on the basis of the principles of the Common Program does not conflict with the spirit of the constitution, so it is still valid and should continue to be implemented. The Tibetan nationality has made its glorious contribution to the creation and development of the great motherland. After returning to the family of the motherland, the Tibetan nationality has completed the unification of the mainland. The draft constitution points out: "The People's Republic of China is a unified multi-ethnic state." "The various ethnic groups in our country have already united into a free and equal family of ethnic groups." This is completely in line with reality. However, imperialism and reactionaries will not be reconciled to their defeat, and they are still continuing to plot to incite discord between the Han and Tibetan ethnic groups and sabotage the unity of the motherland. We must be vigilant and expose the plots and conspiracies of imperialism and reactionaries at all times. We must strengthen patriotic education, fully play the role of the broad united front of people's democracy, and continue to advance under the banner of anti-imperialism and patriotism.

The policy of equal rights for all ethnic groups stipulated in the constitution is the solid political foundation for consolidating the unity of the motherland and the unity of all ethnic groups. Due to historical reasons, the significance of ethnic unity in the Tibet region is even greater. In the implementation of the peace agreement, we have insisted on the policy of long-term unity and cooperation with local upper-class people who have connections with the people, and serving the people. This is very important for strengthening the unity between the Han and Tibetan ethnic groups and within Tibet. We will continue to insist on this policy in the future. I believe that ethnic unity will be more consolidated and developed in the future.

The provisions in the preamble and Articles 67 and 72 of the draft constitution are completely in line with the interests of the Tibetan people and are suitable for the specific situation of Tibet's current and future development. In the past, due to limited conditions, our help to the Tibetan people was far from enough, but this help will gradually increase. The Tibetan people, like the people of the various ethnic groups in the motherland, are hardworking and brave. The future of Tibet is very bright. In the future, Tibet will implement regional autonomy and carry out reforms beneficial to the Tibetan nationality. These will naturally be carried out by the Tibetan people and their leaders who have connections with the people. Han cadres and the Han people will fulfill their responsibilities to help according to the needs of the Tibetan people and their leaders. We have made many mistakes and shortcomings in the implementation of the peace agreement and the policy of national equality and unity in the past, the most important of which is that some Han cadres have remnants of great-nation chauvinism, have a sense of superiority of the great nation, and do not understand the national policy deeply. When working with Tibetan cadres, they do not respect them enough and lack the spirit of democratic consultation, resulting in the phenomenon of doing things for others. Some Han cadres do not pay attention to studying the specific situation and national characteristics of the Tibet region, and there are still many subjective and impatient tendencies in their thinking methods, and they adopt the method of commandism in their work. Some cadres have even committed illegal and disciplinary actions. These phenomena of great Han chauvinism that exist to a greater or lesser extent, and the phenomenon of local nationalism that exists to a certain extent in some Tibetan cadres, are not conducive to the construction of the family of the motherland and are not conducive to the unity, progress, and development of Tibet. The above great Han chauvinism and local nationalism tendencies have been gradually corrected through the efforts of the leaders of the Han and Tibetan ethnic groups. Now the draft constitution clearly stipulates that all ethnic groups are equal, prohibits any discrimination and oppression of ethnic groups, prohibits behaviors that damage ethnic unity, and opposes great-nation chauvinism and local nationalism. This is completely necessary and correct. In the future, we will definitely implement the constitution and ensure that Han cadres working in the Tibet region will always strictly examine their own thoughts and styles, so as to further strengthen the unity of the various ethnic groups in the motherland, especially the unity between the Han and Tibetan ethnic groups and within Tibet. We will definitely, according to the spirit of the constitution, the Seventeen-Article Agreement, and the specific situation of Tibet, strive for the construction of Tibet, the consolidation of national defense, and the gradual realization of the general tasks of the state in the transitional period!

**Speech by Zhudehai Representative**

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I wholeheartedly support the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China and fully agree with Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft constitution.

Since the Central People's Government promulgated the draft constitution, the people of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region in Jilin Province have carried out extensive propaganda and discussion, saying: "The equal rights we enjoy have been fixed in the fundamental law of the state, and in the future, we will permanently enjoy such rights. We will resolutely support this constitution with our actual actions."

Before liberation, the Korean people in Yanbian, like the people of various brotherly ethnic groups, suffered from the oppression of Japanese imperialism and feudal forces under the reactionary rule of Japan, and lived a life worse than cattle and horses. The Korean people have fought side by side with the people of various brotherly ethnic groups against imperialism and feudal forces and have finally gained liberation under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao.

After liberation, the Korean people have enjoyed equal rights under the great national policy of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, and have made rapid development in politics, economy, and culture. We have the confidence to advance to a prosperous and happy socialist society together with the advanced Han people.

According to the provisions of the "Implementation Outline of the National Regional Autonomy of the People's Republic of China," the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region was established in September 1952, further realizing the right to regional autonomy. Now, in the countryside, the number of households participating in agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation has reached 86.2% of the total number of households, and by the spring of next year, more than 50% of the households in the entire region will participate in agricultural production cooperatives. Local state-owned industries have also developed significantly. The autonomous region has established and expanded 44 local state-owned enterprises with the help of the state. With the development of agriculture and industry, people's purchasing power has greatly increased. In 1953, the average purchasing power of the entire region was five and a half times higher than that of the puppet Manchukuo period. Culture and education have also developed accordingly. After liberation, a comprehensive university was established, which is Yanbian University; there are now 42 secondary schools; there are more than 400 primary schools, and the number of school-age children in the autonomous region has reached 95% of the school-age children. The autonomous region has basically controlled the occurrence of serious cholera and other infectious diseases. All these facts prove the correctness of the national policy of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 23rd

    However, due to our low level of policy theory, we do not have a deep understanding of the CCP and Chairman Mao's ethnic policies. In our actual work, there are still many errors and shortcomings, such as not taking good care of the various ethnic minorities within the region, not clearly defining the priorities in economic construction, and having a tendency to rush in cultural education, etc. In the future, we must remain humble and diligent, strive to learn about ethnic policies, and humbly learn from the experiences of various ethnic minorities. In our future work, we must strive to overcome our mistakes and shortcomings.

    Our constitution has consolidated the fruits of the revolutionary struggles of the ethnic peoples and reflects the common aspirations of the ethnic peoples. It has greatly inspired the enthusiasm of the ethnic minorities to participate in the construction of the motherland. We are determined to support the constitution with practical actions, abide by the constitution, and under the leadership of the CCP, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, strive to complete the socialist construction and socialist transformation of the motherland!

    Huang Yanpei's Speech, Chairman, and Representatives!

    I fully agree with the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report.

    This draft constitution, from the first meeting of the Constitution Drafting Committee on March 23 of this year to the revision and adoption by the Central People's Government Committee on September 9, has collected opinions from various aspects. How many opinions were collected? Over 1,180,000. How many characters are there in the entire draft? 8,954 characters, and how many times does the word "people" appear? 262 times.

    I will report a fact. A female comrade from a local grassroots organization, after conveying the draft constitution to the people, told me: "The people initially did not understand the words 'constitution.' They said, 'What is a constitution?' But after explaining it clause by clause, everyone jumped up and said, 'So, this constitution is for us. We must study it well and do as it says.' This incident and these few words are enough to represent the general people's feelings about this constitution. Such things show that this constitution is truly a people's constitution.

    This draft constitution outlines a beautiful future for the People's Republic of China, aiming for socialist industrialization and socialist transformation to gradually eliminate the system of exploitation and build a socialist society. In this process, it stipulates that the state will protect the ownership of production means for peasants, handicraft workers, non-agricultural individual laborers, and capitalists according to the law. At the same time, for the general public, it stipulates that the state will protect their ownership of living means. For capitalists, in addition to protecting the ownership of production means according to the law, it also adds "other capital ownership," which shows that capitalist industry and commerce, if they can play a positive role in the national economy and people's livelihood, not only are industries that produce products but also commercial industries that do not produce products. Their capital ownership is also within the scope of state protection according to the law. However, they must accept state encouragement and guidance to transform these capitalist industries and commerce into state capitalist economies, gradually replacing capitalist ownership with full public ownership. This consideration for capitalist industry and commerce is practical. Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report says: "The national bourgeoisie participated in the national democratic revolution under the leadership of the working class and, in the past five years, participated in the patriotic movement and economic recovery work under the leadership of the state." Comrade Liu Shaoqi also said: "In the transitional period, the national bourgeoisie still has an important role in the national economy." From these points, capitalists! The state expects you to, after the promulgation of this constitution, further play a positive role in the national economy and people's livelihood and actively accept socialist transformation!

    A constitution that is carefully crafted, adopted by the conference, and promulgated by the government, will it itself take effect? No. Everyone in the state organs and all the people must carefully follow it word by word. I have a concern. In the past five years, under the leadership of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao, various policies have been formulated. From the policies themselves, they are correct, but in their implementation in various places, there are many good reflections, but there are still many problems in some places, and some even deviate. The government promulgates a new and good law, but due to problems in its implementation, it may have the opposite effect on part of the people. For example, the Marriage Law liberated women who had been oppressed for thousands of years, which is undoubtedly a great blessing to the people. Since its implementation, is it a blessing? It is a blessing; but in the initial stage of implementation, there were many problems in some places. Therefore, I sincerely urge all parties to pay high attention to the constitution and correctly implement it. All aspects of leadership, management, supervision, and inspection must pay serious attention to the work of implementing the constitution. Representatives of all levels of the People's Congress must correctly reflect the opinions of the people on the work of state organs, discover difficulties or deviations, and must strive to overcome and correct them together.

    Comrade Liu Shaoqi said: "The draft constitution is a summary of the historical experience of the Chinese people's heroic struggle over more than a hundred years." In my opinion, without the correct leadership of the CCP, there would be no today! After liberation, China has gone through the new democratic stage and is moving towards the socialist path. Without the correct leadership of the CCP, there would be no tomorrow! At this time when the economic construction of New China has begun and the constitutional work is about to be completed, I specially pay my highest respect to the great CCP and the great Chairman Mao!

    Zhou Jiancheng's Speech, Chairman, and Representatives:

    The formulation of the constitution is one of the most significant undertakings since the founding of the People's Republic of China and is also the primary task of the first session of the First National People's Congress. The successful completion of this task will be the glory of this session of the conference.

    Since the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China was published, everyone has had a general understanding of its contents through discussions. After listening to Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft constitution, we have gained a clearer understanding of the historical background, basic spirit, and characteristics of this draft constitution. After this draft constitution is adopted by the National People's Congress, it will become the fundamental law that all people and all state organs must jointly abide by. This is a true people's constitution, representing the will of the people, in line with the interests of the people, and serving the people. It consolidates the people's democratic dictatorship, lays the foundation for the rule of law in the country, and ensures that the country achieves a socialist society through peaceful means.

    From the initial draft of the constitution of the People's Republic of China proposed by the CCP Central Committee in March of this year to the revision and adoption of the draft constitution by the Central People's Government Committee this month, submitted to the National People's Congress, this process took more than half a year. During this period, it went through discussions by various democratic parties, people's organizations, and other organizations, full public discussion, and recently also went through discussions by representatives of the National People's Congress in groups, absorbing opinions from various aspects. After repeated research and discussion by the Constitution Drafting Committee, many opinions were reflected in the supplementary and revised articles of the draft constitution. The drafting work of a country's constitution is so meticulous and inclusive in collecting opinions, which is unparalleled in the constitutions of other countries in the world, except for the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries. Just this fact alone is enough to show the democratic nature of our draft constitution. Another point worth noting is that the entire text of the draft constitution is written in vernacular Chinese. The use of vernacular Chinese in the constitution is a revolution in legal language in our country. This makes the constitutional text as popular as possible, convenient for the broad masses of the people to understand and master.

    As a people's constitution, our draft constitution uses language that meets the people's demands.

    Our country is on the path to socialism; the draft constitution naturally belongs to the type of socialist constitution. However, we are still in the transitional period to a socialist society. This transitional period constitution, compared to the constitutions of countries that have already reached a socialist society, naturally has some differences in some aspects. In terms of the economy, we still recognize capitalist ownership. Under the people's democracy, the continued role of the united front led by the CCP is also affirmed in the preamble of the draft constitution; and this political characteristic is also reflected in some articles of the constitution. Our national life is developing rapidly in all aspects. The constitution reflects the changes that are taking place in reality and the goals towards which these changes are headed. As stated in the preamble of the draft constitution, "This constitution consolidates the fruits of the Chinese people's revolution and the new victories in politics and economics since the founding of the People's Republic of China, and reflects the fundamental requirements of the country in the transitional period and the common aspirations of the broad masses of the people to build a socialist society." Therefore, some parts of the draft constitution have a programmatic nature, which is a necessary thing. It is based on the Common Program, summarizing many years of revolutionary and construction experience, and it is based on the spirit of seeking truth from facts, not fabricated out of thin air. We can see that every article has its definite meaning and content, and all have operability. This is another advantage of the draft constitution.

    One basic characteristic of the draft constitution is the realization of thorough democracy. The democratic principle is consistently implemented in our political system.

    The people's congress system defined in the Common Program is affirmed in the constitution, and its contents are also clearly defined. Our state administrative organs, from the State Council to local people's committees at various levels, in other words, our central and local governments, are all produced by the people's congresses, which are state power organs produced by direct or indirect elections, supervised by them, and can be dismissed by them. The people who make up the state power organs are also supervised by their original election units or voters and can be dismissed by them. In the so-called democracy of the capitalist society, the ruling exploiting class, government officials, and congressmen ride on the heads of the people; our state organ personnel, including the Chairman of the People's Republic of China, are all servants of the people. In our country, the people truly rule the country.

    At the same time, all state organs implement the democratic centralism system. According to the principle of democratic centralism, democratic leadership is implemented on the basis of democracy, which can bring into full play the high efficiency of state management. Our political system is a true democracy, a democracy that implements socialism.

    The democratic principle is also reflected in the equality of all citizens under the law; reflected in the universal suffrage system. Our suffrage system is a true universal suffrage, not like the so-called universal suffrage in capitalist countries, which actually deprives many citizens of their suffrage rights due to differences in race, religion, property status, etc. The democratic principle is also implemented in the protection of the rights and interests of ethnic minorities. The draft constitution reflects the correct ethnic policy implemented in New China, first declaring that all ethnic minorities are equal, affirming that ethnic minority areas implement regional autonomy. In the constitution, various aspects of the interests, characteristics, and needs of ethnic minorities are taken into consideration. Such an ethnic policy is a manifestation of the spirit of socialist democracy, which will greatly help to consolidate ethnic unity and develop friendly and mutually supportive relationships between ethnic groups.

    Finally, the draft constitution stipulates the basic rights of citizens, not only in the form of formal stipulations, but also in ensuring the material conditions for the enjoyment of these rights, such as the right to labor and the right to education. This is also a characteristic of a socialist democratic constitution. The citizen's rights guaranteed by our constitution are to be fulfilled, not blank checks; at the same time, the citizen's obligations stipulated by the constitution must also be observed and cannot be treated as mere formalities.

    In summary, the draft constitution submitted to the conference, whether from its substance or form, will be a good constitution for the country, a constitution that meets the needs of the transitional period and the people's demands, although it cannot be said that there will be no shortcomings. However, as pointed out in Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report, this does not mean that after the promulgation of the constitution, "any article stipulated in the constitution will naturally be realized." The implementation of the constitution stipulated requires corresponding conditions for implementation. In fact, according to our country's current reality, there are obviously some conditions lacking in the implementation of some articles of the constitution, which is not something to be concealed.

    To take a few prominent examples, the state guarantees the citizens' right to labor and education, which involves the problems of employment and school facilities. The implementation of the court and procuratorial system involves the problem of legal personnel. The constitution protects the citizens' right to inherit private property, but the country has not yet stipulated inheritance law. The citizens mentioned in the constitution are related to the issue of nationality, but the country has not yet promulgated the nationality law. Of course, in fact, based on policies, instructions, customs, and specific situations, these legal problems can also be solved, but after the promulgation of the constitution, we must act according to the principles of the constitution, and ultimately we cannot do without definite regulations to make decisions. However, this only means that in the implementation of the constitution, we should not ignore such difficulties; this does not mean that the current lack of some material conditions hinders the implementation of the constitution. I believe that such difficulties can be overcome and must be overcome; we must certainly strive to create conditions.

    The promulgation of the constitution just five years after the founding of the People's Republic of China has broad international significance. The birth of the constitution of the People's Republic of China marks the great achievements of the Chinese people's revolution under the leadership of the CCP and reflects the Chinese people's firm confidence and great strength in building a socialist society through peaceful means. This will be a powerful encouragement and spiritual guidance for the broad masses of people around the world who are striving for democracy and progress.

    In the past, China not only had no democratic constitution of the people, but as pointed out by Comrade Liu Shaoqi in his report on the draft constitution, except for the provisional constitution produced by the Xinhai Revolution and immediately torn up by Yuan Shikai, China has never produced a bourgeois democratic constitution. People like me, who are over sixty years old, today can see the birth of a people's constitution and participate in the formulation of this constitution as a people's representative, which is a personal honor. I express my heartfelt support for the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China submitted by the Central People's Government Committee to the conference and suggest that the conference unanimously adopt it.

    Mei Lanfang's Speech, Chairman, and Representatives:

    When I heard Chairman Mao's opening speech and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft constitution, I was simply unable to describe the joy and emotion in my heart.

    Unforgettable 1949, under the wise leadership of the great CCP and Chairman Mao, after a long period of arduous struggle, China was liberated, and the great People's Republic of China was established. Since then, our motherland has gained independence and democracy. Personally, I will never forget the days of hardship that I and the people of the whole country experienced in the past; naturally, I cannot help but deeply feel the prosperity and strength of New China, feel the glory and happiness of being a new Chinese citizen. Now, through the achievements of the country's construction in various aspects over the past five years, summarizing the valuable experience of various aspects, a socialist-type constitution has been formulated. Our motherland will, under the leadership of the great CCP and Chairman Mao, build a prosperous and happy socialist society. I fully agree with and support this draft constitution and express my highest respect to the beloved Chairman Mao.

    The draft constitution correctly and comprehensively stipulates the rights and obligations of citizens. The regulation in Chapter III, Article 95, about guaranteeing and encouraging citizens to engage in scientific research, literary and artistic creation, and other cultural activities, is the same as all the other regulations, not only reflecting the common aspirations of the broad masses of the people but also summarizing the facts of the past five years. As a cultural worker, I feel particularly close to it and have been greatly educated and inspired.

    Chairman Mao's instructions on the reform of opera work, "Let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," have given new life to China's opera art, provided a correct direction and a bright future. The Party and the people's government have always attached great importance to the reform and development of China's traditional opera art. Under the specific leadership of the people's governments at all levels and the joint efforts of all colleagues in the opera circle, our work has achieved initial results, and the stage has begun to take on a new look. Under the guidance of the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," the prosperous scene of Chinese opera that has appeared is unprecedented in Chinese history.

    The government's attention to the cultivation of the younger generation of opera workers is unprecedented and caring. Currently, several opera schools have been established, and a batch of young actors have been cultivated, which is particularly exciting. In order for the opera industry to develop better in the future, I suggest that the government give more support to the cultivation of the younger generation of opera workers. It would be best to plan the cultivation work according to our subjective strength and objective needs, and most importantly, for the future needs, to carry out the cultivation work in a planned manner. Experience has proven that the cultivation of any talent requires a long time; the cultivation of traditional opera actors, as well as the cultivation of talents in traditional opera music, directing, scriptwriting, stage art, and other aspects, also requires long-term and rigorous training, and therefore must start early. Our opera circle suffered various destructions and oppression from the reactionary rulers before liberation, and the situation of many opera genres lacking successors is serious. This should be noted by the government; especially from the situation that the people's demand for culture and art is increasing, then, our planned and quality-oriented cultivation of successors becomes particularly urgent and important.

    Next, I think that in the work of opera reform, we should oppose both violence and conservatism, and one-sided emphasis is wrong. The phenomenon of not respecting opera heritage and national art traditions should still be prevented and opposed. I hope that colleagues engaged in opera work will conduct more in-depth and systematic research on the rich opera heritage of our motherland. At the same time, we should adopt an attitude of development towards national art. Any art, without new development, cannot have new life. Undoubtedly, whether it is Peking opera or various brother opera genres, they all have a long-term realistic tradition; but it is also undeniable that they all still have some dross. Therefore, on the basis of the original tradition, we should carry out some reforms and creations to make our rich and colorful national opera meet the artistic level of the times and better meet the needs of the people. I believe that under the leadership of the people's government, the future of the opera art industry, along with the construction and development of the country, is limitless.

    Dear representatives! When I think of the construction and development of various aspects of New China, I am extremely happy! In recent years, I feel that I am becoming younger and younger. Because I, like every cultural worker, have received great encouragement and help from the government in artistic creation. I am full of confidence in the beautiful future! Now let me shout: Long live the People's Republic of China! Long live Chairman Mao!

    Peng Zemin's Speech, Representatives:

    The draft constitution of the People's Republic of China is a document of great historical significance. We overseas Chinese representatives enthusiastically support this constitution and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft constitution.

    Article 98 of the draft constitution stipulates: "The People's Republic of China protects the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese." For overseas Chinese, who have never received protection from the motherland before the founding of the People's Republic of China, this regulation is particularly gratifying and exciting.

    We overseas Chinese have suffered too much discrimination and exploitation in the past. Especially during the 22 years when the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique ruled China, the humiliation, torture, and even savage persecution that overseas Chinese suffered are indescribable. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique never knew what it meant to protect the rights and interests of overseas Chinese; on the contrary, they only deceived, extorted, and stole the remittances of overseas Chinese, and even colluded with imperialism to harm overseas Chinese. The crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique against overseas Chinese are innumerable. Now, let me talk about a few things that I have seen with my own eyes and remember.

    The Chiang bandits, during their occupation of China, used to exploit, extort, and harm overseas Chinese and their relatives as a consistent policy. As soon as an overseas Chinese stepped into the country, they would be extorted and blackmailed by the special agents sent by the Chiang bandits; if they slightly displeased them, they would be framed and harmed, making it dangerous for overseas Chinese to return to their homeland. This is in stark contrast to the meticulous care policy of the Central People's Government for returning overseas Chinese today.

    The Chiang bandits consistently used their banks to issue paper money that depreciated several times a day; at the same time, they arbitrarily set exchange rates and hoarded remittances, making the remittances sent back to the motherland by overseas Chinese almost worthless when they reached the hands of their relatives. I still remember that in America, an overseas Chinese remitted $300 back to his country according to the exchange rate set by the Chiang bandits' bank, but after being hoarded by the Chiang bandits' bank for half a year, due to the depreciation of the fake currency, the relatives did not want to receive the money, so it was returned to America. After another period, the result was that the fake currency was exchanged back to dollars, which was less than $3, making his family unable to live, and both his parents and children starved to death. During the period of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule, such tragedies were countless.

    During the War of Resistance Against Japan, overseas Chinese, out of patriotic enthusiasm, donated a lot of anti-Japanese and national salvation funds. These patriotic donations, remitted back to the motherland, all became the private property of the Chiang bandits' four big families. The Chiang bandits greedily invented various names, such as "tribute for birthday celebrations," to extort the blood and sweat of overseas Chinese. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, they sent a large number of special agents and party henchmen to overseas, colluding with local thugs to form so-called "anti-spy teams," terrorizing and extorting overseas Chinese businessmen, causing great harm to overseas Chinese. This was the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's poisonous gift to overseas Chinese who loved their country during the War of Resistance Against Japan. The special agents of the Chiang bandits who fled to various countries overseas created disputes in the overseas Chinese community, destroyed the unity of overseas Chinese, and even colluded with imperialists to frame and harm overseas Chinese, openly using force against progressive overseas Chinese. Everyone still remembers that the patriotic overseas Chinese leader Zhang Shunxu in Burma was assassinated by special agents sent by the Chiang bandits. Especially in the Philippines, Thailand, and other regions, the persecution of overseas Chinese was even more severe. Due to time constraints, unfortunately, I could not fully accuse the Chiang bandits' crimes against overseas Chinese to the conference. Recently, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, using American warships and planes, kidnapped overseas Chinese in North Vietnam to Taiwan to be used as cannon fodder; in the Thai region, the special agents of the Chiang bandits, under the command of the American imperialist special agent Duonwan, are organizing so-called "overseas Chinese self-defense teams," attempting to drive our overseas Chinese to be used as cannon fodder in the war of Asians killing Asians. The Chiang bandits, under the protection of American imperialism, have stolen Taiwan as their lair. Using American-made planes, they have been bombing and killing people and overseas Chinese relatives along our coastal regions and islands. The series of treasonous crimes against overseas Chinese by the Chiang bandits have caused deep hatred among overseas Chinese and the people at home. We overseas Chinese will definitely fight together with the people of the motherland to liberate Taiwan, eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and fight to the end!

    The Chinese people have stood up, and only today have the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese truly been protected by the motherland. Overseas Chinese deeply know that the provisions in our constitution that protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese are the fruits of the victory of the Chinese people's revolution. As an overseas Chinese representative, I express my heartfelt thanks to the CCP and Chairman Mao, because only under the wise leadership of the CCP and Chairman Mao can we successfully embark on the bright path of socialism.

    Chen Wangdao's Speech, Chairman, and Representatives:

    I fully agree with the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China.

    This constitution, we believe, has the following characteristics:

    First, it is unprecedented and new in the history of Chinese constitutionalism, and it also has its own characteristics in the same type of constitutions. The Chinese people have been demanding the establishment of a constitution and the implementation of constitutionalism for more than fifty or sixty years, and during this period, various constitutions have appeared, some of which were quite progressive at that time, such as the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China in 1912, but they were all old-type, non-socialist constitutions that could not satisfy the people's aspirations. Only this constitution, which is of the socialist type, can satisfy the aspirations of the people. In the past, no constitution could be compared with it. At the same time, it also has its own characteristics in the same type of constitutions. In places where the situation is similar to other countries, there are similar regulations, and in places where the situation is different from other countries, there are different regulations, such as the people's procuratorate. It is the creation of the Chinese people, not a copy of any existing constitution.

    Second, it is based on the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in 1949 and is also a development of the Common Program. The most obvious development is that the Common Program did not mention how to build a socialist society, but the draft constitution has already specifically stipulated the building of a socialist society. Other aspects have also developed. Development is not in the number of articles. For example, taking the regulations on culture and education, the Common Program has articles 41 to 49 on culture and education, but the draft constitution has only two articles, 94 and 95, on culture and education. However, the draft constitution is more specific about the state establishing and gradually expanding various schools and other cultural and educational institutions, guaranteeing citizens' freedom to engage in scientific research, literary and artistic creation, and other cultural activities, the state encouraging and helping the creative work of citizens engaged in science, education, literature, art, and other cultural undertakings, especially the state's concern for the physical and intellectual development of young people. Although the number of articles is reduced by more than two-thirds compared to the Common Program, in essence, it is a development of the Common Program.

    Third, it is a constitution that requires everyone to strive and advance bravely, not a constitution that allows anyone to stagnate. This constitution not only fixes the revolutionary achievements that the people of our country have won through legislation, but also, through legislation, establishes a plan to ensure that our country can eliminate exploitation and poverty through peaceful means and build a prosperous and happy socialist society. In this process, the people need to work together and advance bravely. In terms of the economy, it has already been listed in Chapter I, General Principles, of the draft constitution, which requires the joint efforts of the people to advance bravely. In terms of culture, education, and other aspects, they also need to be closely coordinated and advance together. We know that the revolutionary achievements fixed by this constitution are not easily won. To liberate the country, the Chinese people have fought bravely for more than a hundred years, especially in the past thirty years, under the leadership of the CCP, they have gone through extremely arduous struggles. The people of our country, who have fought for a long time, will definitely be vigorous and enterprising in front of the great cause of building a socialist society, strengthen the united front of the people's democracy, strengthen the unity of all ethnic groups, develop and consolidate friendship with the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, and also increase friendship with all peace-loving people in the world. With unparalleled enthusiasm and all practical work, we will make the regulations for building a socialist society stipulated in the constitution fully realized.

    Representatives, I believe that the passage of this constitution will definitely become a great driving force for the construction of a socialist society. I suggest that it be passed.

    Gong Tianmin's Speech, Chairman, and Representatives:

    Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China, I fully agree.

    With an extremely excited heart, I welcome the birth of the constitution of the People's Republic of China. Our constitution is of the socialist type. It marks that the Chinese people, after more than a hundred years of heroic struggle, especially in the past thirty years, under the leadership of the CCP and Chairman Mao, have achieved great victories in the people's revolution, pointing out that our country should build a prosperous and happy socialist society. I sincerely support it.

    Since the draft constitution was published, discussions have been held in various places across the country, and people from all walks of life have enthusiastically participated and seriously proposed opinions for revision and supplementation. At the same time, because the draft constitution concerns the interests of the people across the country and expresses the common aspirations of building a socialist society, our constitution has become a great motivating force for the people in production and construction. Capitalists in the industrial and commercial sectors see in the preamble of the draft constitution: "To ensure that our country can eliminate exploitation and poverty through peaceful means and build a prosperous and happy socialist society." They understand that the state's policy towards private industrial and commercial enterprises is quite different from that towards the feudal landlord class. When discussing Article 10, the policy and direction of the state's socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce become clearer. The capitalists in the industrial and commercial sectors in Shenyang who participated in the discussion of the draft constitution happily said: "The future of the country is bright, our direction is determined. As long as we honestly accept socialist transformation, our future is also bright. In the future, we will actively produce and operate, and everything will be fine." Therefore, in the private industrial and commercial sectors, the majority of people are at ease and accept socialist transformation, and want to play their active role; but there are still some people who are passive in production and operation, and even some who destroy machines. In the past few years, the industrial and commercial sectors in Shenyang, under the correct leadership of the CCP and the people's government, and with the support of state processing and ordering, have recovered and developed. Many commercial enterprises that were speculative have turned to industry. Private industry has also played a considerable role in the production of military and civilian goods. The government departments in charge of industrial and commercial affairs have achieved results in their management and guidance work, but there are also shortcomings. The main problem is that in Shenyang, where the state-owned economy has a large share, it is believed that it can drive the development of private industry, so attention is not paid to specific problems that may arise, the number of management cadres is insufficient, and the production situation and technical equipment conditions are not well understood. When specific problems arise, it is difficult to handle them; the propaganda and education of the policy on private industrial and commercial enterprises are not timely, the grasp of the cost of management and processing orders is not accurate, and there are deviations; the state-owned processing units do not lead the business of private factories specifically and deeply. The Shenyang Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce is also not deep enough in these aspects and has not systematically reflected the ideological situation and production and sales problems of private industrial and commercial enterprises to the relevant government departments for reference in planning, and there is a tendency to report good news and not bad news in this regard. I am responsible for this.

    Our draft constitution, after being published, points out the use of the positive role of capitalist industry and commerce, limiting their negative role, which will promote the relevant departments in Shenyang to help private factories improve their production technology, trial-produce new products. Now the relevant government departments are guiding the private mechanical industry to manufacture new agricultural tools to seek development in technological innovation, trial production of new products, quality assurance, and cost reduction, but the production and sales problems of small and medium-sized industries, how private commerce will walk the path of state capitalism, and other issues have not been deeply studied. We must seriously and gradually solve these problems to welcome the implementation of the constitution. I hope that the relevant aspects regarding the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce will actively propose solutions.

    I am a people's representative. I have the determination to, after the conference, combine the transmission of the conference's resolutions, propagate the constitution, and implement the constitution. Under the leadership of the CCP and the people's government at the local level, I will take action, through the local members of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the active elements in the industrial and commercial sectors, mobilize the broad masses of industrial and commercial workers to support the resolutions of the first session of the First National People's Congress with practical actions and support the implementation of the constitution. We must do our best to love the country and abide by the law, actively produce, and improve management, and play our due role in the socialist industrialization. We must strive for the victory of liberating Taiwan and contribute our strength to the struggle to liberate Taiwan, and strive to build our motherland into a great socialist society.

    Garzha's Speech, Chairman, and Representatives:

    I am a representative from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Like all the representatives present, I sincerely support the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China.

    In all parts of the draft constitution, the spirit of ethnic equality is permeated; the policy of freedom of religious belief is also specially stipulated in Article 88 of the draft constitution. These make me feel particularly close and happy.

    I remember that at the beginning of liberation, I heard some bad people spreading rumors: "The CCP does not allow people to believe in religion," "does not allow people to be monks," etc. At that time, I was somewhat suspicious, and I also saw some monks who believed these bad words and ran away to other places.

    However, from my several years of personal experience, since the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, temples and monks' property have been protected, and monks' activities of chanting scriptures, worshipping Buddha, and taking disciples have not been interfered with at all. This is a matter known to all monks in Inner Mongolia.

    Under the leadership of the CCP, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has not only protected the freedom of religious belief but also, due to the implementation of ethnic regional autonomy, has forever freed itself from the sea of suffering and oppression. The economy and culture have developed greatly, the population has increased, the number of livestock has increased, and the people's lives have become richer year by year. The lives of monks have also improved. For example, in our Gandan Temple, there is a monk who had nothing in 1947, but now he has more than twenty cows, and his life is very good. Due to the establishment of monk schools in many temples, the number of monks learning Mongolian is increasing day by day. Monk doctors are also cared for and educated by the government, together with Chinese and Western medicine, they are enthusiastically treating people's illnesses.

    We monks not only believe in the CCP's religious policy but also understand that loving our motherland and loving the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is consistent with loving our freedom of religious belief.

    The monks of Inner Mongolia, in loving the motherland, loving the autonomous region, abiding by the government's laws and orders, responding to the government's calls, in opposing the evil demons of American imperialism, and aiding the Korean people's liberation struggle, have all done their best.

    I am very honored to be able to attend this National People's Congress as a people's representative. This is also the honor of us Buddhists. I am willing to, under the enlightening leadership of the CCP and Chairman Mao's religious policy, work together with all ethnic groups and good people to implement the constitution, abide by the constitution and laws, and respond to the people's entrustment.

    I suggest that the conference pass this constitution that fully expresses the wishes of all ethnic groups and people.

    Finally, I am satisfied with the implementation of the policy of freedom of religious belief by the people's governments at all levels in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. However, in some places and among some cadres, there are still some inappropriate practices in the implementation of the religious policy, such as requiring too much and too urgently in increasing livestock and studying culture. I hope the government will pay attention to these shortcomings in the future.

    May all ethnic groups be united!
    May the motherland be prosperous and strong!
    May Chairman Mao live forever!
    May there be peace!

    Ma Hongbin's Speech, Representatives:

    I fully agree with and support the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China.

    In the past five years, various undertakings in the ethnic minority regions have developed significantly, and various ethnic groups have united into a free and equal family.

    The preamble of the draft constitution stipulates: "In the process of economic and cultural construction, the state will consider the needs of various ethnic groups, and in the issue of socialist transformation, it will fully consider the characteristics of the development of various ethnic groups." This is in line with the interests of the ethnic peoples and is very important.

    Our draft constitution has been discussed in various places and ethnic groups across the country for many days, incorporating the opinions of various individuals, and has been revised many times by the Constitution Drafting Committee before being submitted. The bright future of our country and the happy aspirations of the broad masses of the people are all clearly stated in the draft constitution. It is the most perfect and happiest. I believe that after the draft constitution is passed, the ethnic minorities in the northwest will definitely support and abide by it to achieve a socialist society. What a blessing!

    Deng Fangzhi's Speech, Chairman, and Representatives:

    I am a widow of a revolutionary martyr. I am very happy and honored to be able to come to Beijing to attend the National People's Congress. I think of the days of hardship that we women experienced before liberation; I had never even walked forty miles, let alone being a representative! This is all thanks to the CCP and Chairman Mao, who have given us today.

    During the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, I sent my son Huang Jiguang to the front lines in Korea, where he fought bravely on Mount Gangnam. He died a glorious death, giving a heavy blow to the American devils. He is my own son, he is a good son of all the people of China. The people of the whole country memorialize him, and I also feel very honored. I will definitely follow in my son's footsteps, love the country, and do a good job.

    This time, I studied the draft constitution and listened to the report on the draft constitution. I know that this is truly our own constitution. Now, the people are truly the masters of the house. Only by doing as the constitution says can we reach a happy socialist society. Therefore, I sincerely support this constitution. After returning, I will convey the situation of the conference to everyone, propagate and mobilize all the people in the township, especially the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, to support the constitution, abide by the constitution; and also mobilize everyone to join mutual aid teams and production cooperatives, work hard to increase grain production, and support national industrial construction, support the liberation of Taiwan. Only in this way can we repay the CCP, repay Chairman Mao, and also repay my son Huang Jiguang.

    Shao Lizi's Speech, Chairman, and Representatives:

    I, like all the representatives, feel extremely honored to be able to participate in the great cause of formulating the constitution of our motherland. Since the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China was proposed, I have participated in many discussions, provided several opinions; before and after the draft constitution was submitted for public discussion, I also participated in some work, paying attention to the collection of opinions from various aspects; recently, I also participated in the discussion of the Zhejiang Province delegation of the National People's Congress and listened to Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report. I deeply feel that the people across the country praise this draft constitution, the Constitution Drafting Committee attaches great importance to the people's opinions, and this constitution is truly the people's own constitution. I believe that the conference will unanimously and solemnly pass this constitution, and the people across the country will be united in spirit and enthusiastically support this constitution.

    This constitution is of the socialist type. In the past few years, the people across the country have gone through various social reform movements, seen the great achievements in various aspects, understood the superiority of the people's democratic system, understood the importance of the general tasks of the transitional period, and in the process of discussing the draft constitution, proposed more than 110,000 opinions for revision and supplementation, and there was not a single opinion opposing the goal of socialism. Building a socialist society has indeed become the common aspiration of the broad masses of the people. This is the best guarantee for the thorough implementation of the constitution. However, the people across the country, while feeling excited and inspired, should also be cautious and vigilant, strengthen their vigilance. The fact that no one proposed an opinion opposing socialism does not mean that no one has an anti-socialist consciousness. Because the vast majority of people want to advance towards socialism, the few naturally do not dare to openly oppose socialism, but it cannot be said that they do not want to sabotage and obstruct it in secret. There will be many difficulties ahead of us, and we must rely on the constitution, this powerful weapon, to overcome it. In addition, because we were backward in various aspects in the past, there are still many difficulties ahead of us. For example, the land is vast, and the population is large, which is something we can be proud of, but before the backward phenomena are eliminated, it also causes some difficulties.

    Because the land is vast, the climate is not uniform across the country, and every year there will be some regions affected by natural disasters. This year, many places have had continuous rain, and the floods have become very large. If it were not for the CCP leading the people to bravely fight against the floods, the disaster would have been unimaginable. In the past five years, the Central People's Government has attached great importance to water conservancy, and the water conservancy departments have also worked very hard, which is inspiring. But the water disaster this year is still so great, which is due to the fact that the difficulties that originally existed are too many and cannot be overcome in a short time, but we must have the determination to overcome it, and we must strengthen this aspect of work. Stalin once said: With the development of human knowledge, people have learned to build dams and hydroelectric stations, which can make society prevent floods that were previously impossible to prevent; not only that, but they can also make water power serve society for good. We should add the work of dredging rivers to this aspect.

    The difficulties presented by the large population are most prominent in the field of culture and education. Now, just take the fact that school-age children cannot all be enrolled as an example. The constitutions of the Soviet Union and new democratic countries all clearly stipulate compulsory primary education. Our constitution does not write this in, which shows the realism of the draft constitution and also shows that this problem cannot be solved in a short period. The constitution stipulates that the people have the right to education, and it is guaranteed by the state establishing and gradually expanding various schools and other cultural and educational institutions. This is very inspiring. But whether the gradual expansion of various schools can keep up with the annual increase in the birth rate of children is still a question. Since our country is going to advance towards socialism, it is necessary to make every school-age child have the opportunity to be enrolled. I hope that the people's governments at all levels and local agricultural cooperatives will make more efforts in this regard, and at the same time, people in society with knowledge and wealth should also help the state overcome this difficulty. The state allows individuals to establish middle and primary schools in accordance with the law and under state supervision.

    The population is a good thing, but in an environment with many difficulties, it seems that there should be some limits. The constitution stipulates that mothers and children are protected by the state, which is also very inspiring. But if the mothers always give birth to a child every year, or even if their bodies are already very weak and the burden is too heavy, they still cannot help but give birth to children, the state will also find it very difficult to protect them, and their own suffering is not to be mentioned. Lenin once pointed out that the working class is incompatible with new Malthusianism, but he also said: "This does not at all prevent us from demanding the immediate abolition of all laws punishing abortion, or the propagation of medical theories related to contraception, etc." In our country, the issue of abortion can be set aside, but the medical theories related to contraception, etc., should indeed be propagated, and moreover, they should be guided and supplied with related contraceptive methods and items in practice.

    I firmly believe that the sooner the general tasks of the transitional period are completed, the sooner we can overcome all the difficulties in front of us, so we must work together to accelerate the completion of socialist industrialization and socialist transformation. I also firmly believe that under the guidance of the constitution drafted by Chairman Mao, the people across the country will strengthen unity, strengthen vigilance, and advance together towards the goal of socialism, and any difficulty can be overcome.

    Finally, I would like to express that I fully agree with Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China.

    He Long's Speech, Chairman, and Representatives:

    With an extremely excited heart, I attend the first session of the First National People's Congress and participate in the formulation of the constitution of the People's Republic of China. Everyone knows that the People's Liberation Army, since the day it was established, has been fighting to liberate the people of the whole country, so that they can forever free themselves from the oppression and slavery of the old society, and build a beautiful and happy socialist society. For this purpose, the excellent sons and daughters of the Chinese people have taken up arms, organized themselves, and fought a resolute revolutionary struggle. For more than twenty years, they have gone through a difficult road, experienced a cruel war, and countless revolutionary martyrs have shed their blood for this lofty goal. Under the leadership of the CCP, the people of the whole country finally achieved a great victory and established the People's Republic of China. After the victory, the People's Liberation Army, on the one hand, vigilantly guards the national defense, eliminates bandits, and actively participates in national construction. On the other hand, it has also done a great deal of work in the regularization and modernization of the army to further strengthen our national defense forces. After the draft constitution was published, the entire army immediately carried out heated discussions and unanimously agreed that this constitution, in the form of law, has fixed the fruits of the long-term revolution and fully reflects the aspirations of the people of the whole country and the People's Liberation Army to build a socialist society. This has given the officers and soldiers of the entire army great encouragement and further enhanced their confidence in victory in defending the motherland and building a socialist society. Therefore, we wholeheartedly support the constitution that the conference is about to pass and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report, and we are determined to abide by the constitution and act according to the constitution.

    Article 20 of the constitution stipulates the tasks of the People's Liberation Army of China, which is to defend the fruits of the people's revolution and national construction, defend the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and security of the state. We will definitely complete this sacred task. We will resolutely suppress all counter-revolutionary sabotage activities; we will thoroughly smash any aggressive actions by imperialism. The entire mainland has been completely liberated, but the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is still occupying Taiwan, continuing to betray the country, and further relying on American imperialism. With the support of American imperialism, it is constantly carrying out harassment and sabotage wars against our southeastern coastal regions and islands, and even wants to carry out counter-revolutionary restoration, turning the whole of China into an American colony. The Central People's Government's call to liberate Taiwan and the joint declaration of various democratic parties and people's organizations to liberate Taiwan have been enthusiastically supported by all the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. They have expressed their determination to definitely liberate Taiwan, eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, maintain the integrity of our country's sovereignty and territory, and defend the peace of Asia and the world. We will not stop until we achieve our goal.

    After the constitution is passed, all the people across the country should conscientiously abide by it. The People's Liberation Army has a glorious tradition of abiding by government laws and orders, and in the future, it must also become a model of abiding by the constitution and laws. However, after the victory, some comrades in the army have developed a sense of arrogance due to their merits, and a sense of contempt for discipline. Therefore, violations of the interests of the masses and violations of discipline have occurred frequently. This is unacceptable and is a despicable behavior that goes against the glorious traditions of the People's Liberation Army. We have already taken effective measures to stop this phenomenon. In the future, we must continue to strengthen education, further improve the political awareness of all soldiers, carry forward the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army, and make every soldier consciously become a model of abiding by the constitution and laws.

    We are fully convinced that with the wise leadership of the CCP and Chairman Mao, the united efforts of the people across the country, and the strong defense of the People's Liberation Army, we will definitely be able to accomplish the great historical task of building a socialist society in our country as stipulated in the constitution.

    Xu Dehua's Speech, Chairman, and Representatives:

    I am very honored to attend the first session of the First National People's Congress. This session will pass the constitution of the People's Republic of China, which is the first constitution since the founding of the People's Republic of China. I sincerely and enthusiastically support this draft constitution and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China.

    Everyone knows that this constitution is the crystallization of the blood of countless revolutionary martyrs over the past few decades. Due to the wise leadership of the CCP and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people overthrew the evil rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism and established a people's democratic government; in the past five years, the people across the country have achieved glorious achievements in various fronts, and now they have summarized these achievements and the experience of international and Chinese revolutions and fixed them in the form of legislation. This constitution represents the common interests of the people across the country, embodies the common aspirations of the people across the country, and points out the road that the people across the country should take—the road to build a prosperous and happy socialist society. It can be predicted that after the promulgation of the constitution, the broad masses of the people across the country will show greater enthusiasm and creativity, accelerate the socialist construction process of our country.

    This constitution, after being promulgated, will have a great impact on a global scale. More than six hundred million people who have stood up in China, acting together on the common track stipulated in the constitution, will fight more powerfully for the construction of socialism and the defense of world peace, which will greatly encourage the democratic and progressive broad masses of the world, especially the broad masses of people in Asia. But on the other hand, our enemies—the American imperialists and their puppets, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, do not accept defeat and are using all their strength to sabotage us. To maintain the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country, to defend the peace of Asia and the world, the people across the country must be even more closely united around the CCP and Chairman Mao, redouble their vigilance, and fight to the end to achieve the victory of liberating Taiwan and completely eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

    After the promulgation of this constitution, the revolutionary legal system of our country will be further strengthened. All state organ personnel and the people across the country should implement the spirit and various stipulations of the constitution in their work and life, strictly abide by the constitution and laws. Article 18 of the draft constitution stipulates: "All state organ personnel must be loyal to the people's democratic system, obey the constitution and laws, and strive to serve the people." Article 100 stipulates: "The citizens of the People's Republic of China must abide by the constitution and laws, abide by labor discipline, abide by public order, and respect social ethics." To supervise whether the administrative organs at all levels of the state, state organ personnel, and citizens abide by the laws, the draft constitution stipulates the procuratorial power of the People's Procuratorates at all levels of the People's Republic of China. These stipulations are correct and necessary. In the past five years, our country has carried out a series of democratic reform movements, including the "Three Antis" and "Five Antis" movements and the struggles against bureaucratism, against compulsory orders, and against lawlessness and discipline. The social atmosphere has undergone a fundamental change. However, at present, there are still phenomena of not abiding by the laws among some state organ personnel and the masses, and lawlessness and discipline are still occurring, some of which are quite serious, causing losses to the people's cause. This phenomenon must be corrected. Therefore, I suggest that after the promulgation of the constitution, propaganda and education on abiding by the law should be strengthened nationwide, and a resolute struggle should be waged against all lawlessness and discipline. State organ personnel must lead by example, abide by and implement the constitution and laws, and gradually establish a wind of consciously abiding by the constitution and laws among the people across the country. In the future, we must not only be labor models but also be models of abiding by the law. Next, I also suggest that the Law Committee to be established by the National People's Congress, based on the stipulations of the constitution and the needs of national construction, strengthen legislative work, so that our revolutionary legal system can gradually become perfect.

    We will follow Chairman Mao's instructions in his opening speech at this conference: "Work hard, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, be honest and diligent, help and encourage each other, and be extremely vigilant against any boasting and arrogance, and prepare to turn our country, which is currently economically and culturally backward, into a great country with high modern cultural standards in a few five-year plans."

    I wish the conference a success! I wish all the representatives good health!

    Li Guowei's Speech, Chairman, and Representatives:

    Today, under the wise leadership of the CCP and Chairman Mao, the first socialist-type constitution is being formulated, which is extremely worthy of celebration and excitement!

    Now, I would like to talk about my understanding of the spirit of this constitution.

    First of all, this constitution is a truly democratic constitution. The constitutions of capitalist countries, all voters and candidates are restricted by various conditions such as race, education level, property (i.e., paying taxes above a certain amount), etc. So, progressive-minded people think that their constitutions are hypocritical and fake democracy; I think this criticism is appropriate. Our constitution is not like that, but rather, all citizens who are eighteen years old or older, regardless of ethnicity, race, gender, occupation, social origin, religious beliefs, education level, property status, and length of residence, as long as they are not mentally ill and are not deprived of the right to vote and be elected according to the law, all have the right to vote and be elected. So, everyone has the opportunity to strive for themselves. As long as they contribute to the people and the country, consistently do good deeds, and do not give up halfway, they have the possibility of being elected as people's representatives. Moreover, our constitution not only stipulates the basic rights of citizens but also proposes material guarantees, so everyone will develop towards a bright and upright direction and will not be willing to think of the lowly and selfish direction of seeking only profit. This is the promotion of human rights, a truly democratic constitution, and I wholeheartedly support it.

    I am a person who has experienced various hardships in the industrial sector and do not need to mention the great hardships suffered from the oppression of imperialism and the destruction of bureaucratic capitalism. Even when buying land to build a factory, due to the existence of feudal forces, there were tombs and vacant land left inside the factory, left there, and could not be bought into the factory building, which increased unreasonable expenses in construction costs and production costs, and also hindered development. In terms of capital, due to the lack of a definite source, there were many restrictions in the accumulation of capital, such as when there was profit, the shareholders always wanted to divide more, so only small and scattered plans could be made, and it was not possible to make large-scale and concentrated construction. Today, our private factories are walking the path of state capitalism, with a definite source of capital, and a definite regulation for the accumulation of capital. If you need land, need talents, it is extremely convenient; so, like our Baoji factory, after being transformed into a joint public-private enterprise, in less than two years, it has expanded by more than one fold, and profits have increased by more than three times. Therefore, this year, our Wuhan factory, Chongqing factory, Shanghai factory, Chengdu factory are all successively transformed into joint public-private enterprises and are in the process of expansion; our sixteen factories, eleven of which have already entered the stage of joint public-private enterprises, and now our Fuxin Flour Mill in Guangzhou, which has been approved by the local government to be transformed into a joint public-private enterprise, is in the process of handling procedures, yesterday I received a letter from Shanghai, saying that the Shanghai factory and Chengdu factory of the newly established China Flour Company are also applying for joint public-private enterprises. The rapid achievements of joint public-private enterprises in developing production will greatly accelerate the progress of socialist industrial construction. The constitution encourages capitalists to walk the path of state capitalism, so I wholeheartedly support it.

    In terms of the construction of state-owned heavy industry: such as the expansion of Anshan Iron and Steel, the construction of railways, and the construction of water conservancy, everyone has seen that in just a few years, it has developed so rapidly! If it were left to private individuals, like the capitalist countries, with the profit point of view as the starting point for doing industry, it would shackle production, and the country would never be rich and strong. I support this constitution.

    Again, this year's Yangtze River flood is unprecedented in a hundred years. The flood control work in Wuhan, under the leadership of the CCP and the people's government, with the support of the people across the country, and the selfless labor of workers, peasants, soldiers, and the masses, made Wuhan not suffer from water disasters, creating a historical miracle of the Chinese people's struggle against floods, which is unimaginable in capitalist countries.

    This constitution is a constitution that consolidates peace: in the preamble, it clearly states that internally, it will give full play to the role of the people's democratic united front, emphasizing peaceful socialist transformation; it will also emphasize national unity, friendship, and mutual assistance. Externally, it will establish an unbreakable friendship with the great Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, and based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, it will establish and develop diplomatic relations with any country, and strive for the lofty goal of world peace and human progress. Such a peaceful internal and external policy will certainly gain the sympathy and attention of the people around the world who love peace. The success of this Geneva Conference has already laid the foundation for peace in East Asia, and American imperialism has been isolated. This is a living fact. In the near future, Taiwan will certainly be liberated. Therefore, this constitution will not only be enthusiastically supported by the people across the country but will also make the people around the world who love peace extremely excited and inspired!

    Finally, I deeply feel that our country has experienced thousands of years of hardship and suffering, and only under the leadership of the great CCP and Chairman Mao can we gain true liberation and have such a realistic and upright constitution. I wholeheartedly support it, and I am indescribably excited and happy! I am excited and inspired to be reborn under the illumination of the constitution!

    Wu Yaozong's Speech, Representatives:

    The first session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China is about to solemnly pass the constitution formulated by the Chinese people themselves, which is a shocking event for the Chinese people who have suffered countless pains and sufferings for thousands of years. We Christians across the country enthusiastically support this constitution, fully agree with Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report, and are willing to strive for the implementation of this constitution.

    I myself, during a long period, was once a seeker of "idealism." I believed in the anti-violence loveism that opposes any violence, regarding it as the panacea for liberating mankind; I was intoxicated with the false democracy of the West, which advocates freedom, equality, and fraternity, thinking that such democracy could make China achieve independence and prosperity. However, the cruel facts have long shattered my illusions. The constitution that we are about to pass makes us clearly see the correct path to realize our peaceful and happy life. This is not some "ideal" fabricated by someone out of thin air, but a reality that can certainly be gradually achieved, because the path we take is in line with the development of history and the needs of the people, and the state institutions and citizens' rights and obligations stipulated in the constitution all fully reflect the spirit of democracy, which guarantees that we will certainly be able to complete our great historical task of building a socialist society.

    In the regulations on citizens' rights and obligations in the draft constitution, religious freedom is listed as a separate article, which is particularly satisfying to us religious believers. Before and after liberation, due to the malicious propaganda of imperialism, many Christians had fears about the issue of religious freedom: the CCP does not believe in religion, will the government led by the CCP really respect religious freedom? The Common Program basically dispelled this concern. However, due to the relationship between Christianity and imperialism over the past hundred years, the implementation of the religious policy, for Christianity, is not a simple matter and not an easy matter. Up to now, there are still some problems in the churches in various places that have not been completely solved. However, the facts of the past five years have proven that the government has used great efforts to implement the religious policy, and the government has also given careful attention and strong support to the needs of the church and the patriotic movement of three self-love for Christianity. A Christian friend said: "I used to think that religious freedom was transitional, but now I know that the government can say it and do it." The draft constitution's regulation on religious freedom makes us have a clearer understanding of the government's consistent implementation of the religious policy, and will also make the imperialist's slanderous propaganda against the new China's religion completely bankrupt.

    Abiding by the constitution and laws is the duty of every citizen, and Christians naturally cannot be an exception. We cherish religious freedom, and we should not misuse this freedom to engage in any activities that are harmful to the people and beneficial to imperialism. At the same time, we should be highly vigilant against the imperialists' continued use of Chinese Christianity for their plots.

    More than a month ago, we held the National Christian Conference in the capital Beijing. This conference is an unprecedented great unity of Chinese Christianity. At the conference, we called on Christians across the country to support the constitution, actively participate in the great socialist construction of the motherland, and actively participate in the movement to defend world peace. We condemned American imperialism's aggression against China, firmly opposed the United States' occupation of our territory Taiwan, and responded to the call to liberate Taiwan with actual actions. We will definitely continue to carry out the patriotic movement of three self-love for Christianity with our greatest strength and regard our efforts as our gift to celebrate the birth of the first constitution of the People's Republic of China.

### 在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上  代表们关于宪法草案和报告的发言

专栏：

    在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上
    代表们关于宪法草案和报告的发言
    赛福鼎代表的发言敬爱的主席、各位代表：
    中华人民共和国宪法草案，充分保证了中国各少数民族的平等自由权利和在政治、经济、文化等各方面获得巨大发展，将使各少数民族同全国人民共同过渡到繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。我们新疆各族人民及其代表们完全拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案和刘少奇同志关于宪法草案的报告，并坚决为实现它而斗争。
    新疆各族人民经历过痛苦的民族压迫和封建压迫的历史，进行过英勇的反民族压迫的斗争，但只有在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，才消灭了民族压迫，实行了民族平等，并在这一基础上根除了历史上长期存在的民族分裂的现象，实现了民族团结。这一民族团结是日益发展和牢不可破的。新疆解放后，过去反动统治所造成的新疆各民族落后与贫困的情况，已经起了巨大的变化。由于完成了土地改革和民主改革，进行了恢复和发展国民经济的工作，新疆的经济和文化得到了很大发展，各族人民的物质生活和文化生活得到了很大提高。现在新疆已经进行和正在进行民族区域自治，通过民族区域自治，进一步地增强了民族团结，大大提高了各族人民的政治积极性和劳动热忱，并将使自治区的政治、经济、文化建设事业获得新的发展。现在新疆已经具有进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造的良好的政治基础和一定的经济基础。当然，新疆在进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业中还存在不少困难，但我认为这些困难是可以逐步克服的。
    建设繁荣幸福的社会主义社会，不仅是新疆各族人民的愿望，而且已经成为新疆各族人民的实际斗争生活。新疆各族人民在自己的这一新的生活中看到了社会主义社会和自己民族发展的美好的前途而感到无限的欢欣鼓舞。新疆各族人民根据自己的切身经验，深刻地知道：平等、自由、幸福生活的获得和政治、经济、文化事业的发展，是伟大的中国共产党和毛主席领导的结果，是团结在伟大的祖国——自由平等的民族大家庭中的结果，是伟大的汉族人民帮助的结果，也是各民族自己努力的结果。
    我完全相信，新疆各族人民在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，遵循中华人民共和国宪法所指出的方向和道路前进，一定能够和全国人民共同过渡到繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。
    许广平代表的发言各位代表：
    我是封建大家庭出身，又是在最早遭受帝国主义侵略的地区——广东出生的，我在屈辱和欺凌中消磨了童年，又在磨难和迫害中度过了壮年，想不到就在白发渐多的时候，我跟全国人民一道翻了身。今天，我又亲身参加了第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，这次会议要庄严地通过中华人民共和国宪法。共产党救了我。共产党又给了我光荣。我热泪盈眶，说不出的兴奋，说不出的感激。我相信在座的代表们一定也有不少人怀着同我一样的心情。
    我们的宪法是用无数先烈们的鲜血写成的。它巩固了中国人民革命的成果，也是我们向着社会主义康庄大道前进的明灯。我们要在它的光辉照耀下，一齐努力，来完成国家过渡时期的总任务，建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。
    毛主席指示我们：“思想改造，首先是各种知识分子的思想改造，是我国在各方面彻底实现民主改革和逐步实行工业化的重要条件之一。”我想这也就是我们知识分子在过渡时期重要的任务。
    过去五年以来，在党的正确领导和帮助之下，我们知识分子的思想改造取得了很大的成就。但是按照社会前进的速度来说，我敢说这些成就跟迅速发展的形势还不够相称的。过渡时期是激烈变化的时期，知识分子的思想改造，也必须相应地随着变化而不断进行。如果我们对于自己的思想改造感到某些满足而停滞不前，那么，终于会落在形势的后面，而成为社会的渣滓。这好比一棵被虫害了的树，需要经常的修剪整理，除虫加肥，才能枝叶茂盛，欣欣向荣，否则就难免迎风摇落而枯萎。
    我常常感到痛苦，觉得像我这样封建家庭出身的知识分子，真浑身是毛病，去也去不完。但同时也更加感到加紧改造的迫切性，毛病尽管去不完，只要决心去，总是愈去愈少的。
    几年来，我对于自我改造的努力是非常不够的，党和人民爱护我，党和人民培养我。但是今天自己认真的检查一下，我真是惭愧无地了！
    我痛切感到知识分子思想改造的最大妨碍是各色各样的个人主义和自由主义。把个人利益放在第一位，要集体利益服从个人利益，这样的本末倒置，你再说几百遍“思想改造”，也不会发生多大的效果。端正个人利益与集体利益的位置，一定要使个人利益服从集体利益，这是有效进行自我改造的根本问题。
    资产阶级的自由主义，也是妨害我们前进的东西。我们口头上常常说“跟中国共产党走”，但实际上，往往跟党保持有距离。造成这种“距离”的主要原因之一，就是腐朽的自由主义。当面唯唯诺诺，有话不讲，背后嘁嘁喳喳，怪论连篇。为自己打算的多，替人民设想的少，这样，怎么能够轻松愉快，诚心诚意跟着前进呢？更怎么够得上作为朋友和助手呢？我们都从旧社会来，对于这份旧社会腐朽的历史遗产，是非下决心抛弃不可的。
    我常常想，社会在前进，我们如不努力改造自己是不行的。过渡时期千变万化，决不容许我们堂而皇之，原封不动。我们有了总路线作为灯塔，有了宪法作为指南针，并且有了共产党这样正确可靠的引路者，幸福繁荣的社会主义的灿烂前途就在前面了！
    但是光有了灯塔，有了指南针，有了引路者，并不等于就是达到了目的地。路还是需要我们自己来走的，你不走，你只能掉在后面。
    我坚决拥护我们人民自己的宪法。我认为要证明我们是否真诚拥护宪法，最好从我们是否真诚改造自己来考验。我保证同全国人民代表和全国人民一起，彻底改造自己，坚决为贯彻宪法的实施而努力前进。
    舒舍予代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    在过去的两三个月里，我参加过不少次文艺界对宪法草案的学习和讨论。宪法草案上规定了言论与出版的自由。这使文艺界特别兴奋。作家们是喜爱说话的，不用嘴说，就用笔说。可是，在国民党的反动统治下，我们的嘴被堵住，我们的笔被迫而放下来，我们连闲谈的时候都得防备着隔墙有耳！我们往往因为写了一封信而被囚禁起来。我们之中有不少人受过毒刑，甚至丧掉生命！那时候的图书审查制度给我们无限的痛苦。有些作家的作品，不管内容如何，总会被禁止出版。这些作家的名字就是反动政府所最不喜欢看见的。这丑恶的制度给人民与作家的中间砌了一堵大墙。这制度禁止为人民说话的好书，同时却鼓励黄色的下流“作品”的出版。它不仅剥夺了我们的出版自由，而且污辱了文艺！
    今天我们得到了言论自由与出版自由的保证，我们怎能不欢喜得难以形容呢！我们一定要以用尽
  一切才能与热情写出更多更好的作品，表示拥护宪法的决心！
    我们也知道，只要今后我们肯在创作上积极地为人民服务，我们必能获得比五年来已经得到的还要更多更大的鼓励与帮助。我们感激宪法草案第九十五条对文学艺术创造给予鼓励与帮助的规定！我们誓死不许压迫过我们多少年的、蓄意扼杀文艺的反革命复辟！我们要同全国人民在一道，决心保卫我们的革命胜利和人民宪法！
    谈到帮助，我愿提出一点意见：我们今天需要的最大帮助，是给我们充裕的时间去学习，去体验生活，去安心写作。当然，我们应当，也乐意，多参加社会活动。可是，因为以往的办法不妥，我们就往往终日忙忙碌碌，顾此失彼。我们希望今后领导上与社会上都能够注意到作家的首要任务是创作，而创作必须有充裕的预备时间，写作时间和修改时间。领导机关似应商议一下，给作家们的社会活动作个计划，适当地分分工，不要教大家劳逸不均，也不要教社会活动占去过多的写作时间。举个例说，一个作家早晨已上飞机场去过一次，就别教他下午再去一次；大家可以轮流着去嘛。对于参加招待会、纪念会、欢迎会、欢送会等等也应妥为安排。大家分工，才能人人积极，事事作好。非把积极分子弄得不积极了不拉倒的办法是不大科学的。再以听报告来说吧，在通知上就该说明报告什么，已听过的可以不再参加。可是，通知上往往只说“务请参加”，别的不提。因此，我常常听三次同一内容的传达报告，至少耽误两个半天的写作时间。我也常同时接到同时开会的三四份通知，都写着“务请参加”，闹得我手足失措。是的，有了适当的分工，才能使作家既不至打乱学习与写作的计划，还能热心地参加社会活动，两不耽误。领导上社会上多珍惜作家的时间，就能帮助作家及早完成写作计划。
    我们拥护宪法草案和刘少奇同志的报告，而且确信我们的宪法是一定行得通的！可是，我们也知道，以前我们的许多工作还缺乏精确的分工，还没有很好地建立起科学的工作制度，所以往往遇事乱抓，作得不好。这将给宪法的施行多少地带来些困难。为迎接宪法，为保证宪法的顺利施行，我们首先应当在事事有条有理中养成守法的精神与习惯，绝对不许随随便便，忙乱无章。我们在前面提出的要求虽然很小，可是以小比大，我们切盼：既有了宪法，事事就必须顺理成章，有计划有组织，有适当的分工，合理的安排，一点也不慌不乱！同志们，让我们都以科学的工作方法配合守法的精神，在人民宪法的光明照耀下，及早建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会吧！胡耀邦代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案和刘少奇同志关于宪法草案的报告。这个宪法保障了我国青年已经得到的自由和幸福，照亮了他们更加美好的远大前程。
    在旧中国，反动派残酷地迫害青年，青年的政治权利被剥夺，青年的创造才能被摧残，青年的身心健康被戕害。在新中国，我们的国家把青年看作自己的将来，给了青年政治的、经济的、劳动的和受教育的各种权利，从各方面关心青年，培养青年。我们的国家给了年满十八岁的青年以选举权和被选举权，使近八千万青年能够在实际生活中学习管理国家大事。我们的国家为青年办了几十万所学校和许多其他的文化教育机关，使近六千万学生和两千多万工农青年能够在各级学校和各种业余学校中学习。我们的国家从各方面为青年创造了劳动条件，使一千万青年能够在厂矿企业和国家机关中工作，一万万青年农民能够在自己的土地上愉快地生产。我们的国家不断地增加卫生体育设施，使广大青年的体质能够迅速地增强。由于国家的关怀，中国青年得到了历史上从来没有过的全面发展。中国青年对伟大的中国共产党和毛主席充满着无限的爱戴。
    宪法指引着我国人民为建成社会主义而斗争。这是一个非常艰巨、非常复杂的任务。宪法所体现的国家对青年的特别关怀，就是殷切地期望青年们能够承担和发展这个伟大的事业。中国青年必须时时刻刻想到摆在自己面前的责任的重大，下定决心为祖国贡献自己的最大力量。广大青年是懂得自己的责任的，他们在各个战线上英勇积极，为国家作出了有价值的贡献。他们中间涌现出来的成千成万个劳动模范和先进人物，更为新中国的青年树立了良好的榜样。
    但是我们的工作还有缺点。我们对青年中的思想问题抓得不紧，对广大青年的社会主义教育做得还差，在青年中提倡艰苦奋斗不够。由于旧社会残余思想的影响和资产阶级思想的腐蚀，某些青年滋长着一种依赖思想，不愿艰苦劳动，不求上进，贪图安逸，追求个人享受。我们对某些学校中缺乏纪律性的状况，没有给予应有的注意，没有认真地协助学校行政和教师对那些违反纪律的人进行必要的教育和处罚，这对于青年学生来说，是有害无益的。我们对那些暗藏的反革命分子、流氓分子毒害青年的罪恶行为，缺乏警惕，没有进行坚决的严肃的斗争，使得这些坏分子能够引诱某些落后青年腐化堕落，做损害人民利益的事。我们必须正视和克服这些缺点，努力去组织和团结广大青年为建成社会主义而斗争。
    宪法是中国青年的一部生动的教科书，我们将从这里汲取智慧和力量。我们要使青年都知道，我们的先烈把自己的鲜血献给了人民的解放事业，我们这一代必须用英勇的劳动把祖国建成一个伟大的社会主义国家。我们要大力克服青年中轻视劳动的腐朽思想。我们要动员青年用顽强的学习来掌握建设祖国所必需的科学技术。我们要号召青年努力把自己锻炼成为勇敢、机智、健壮和刻苦耐劳的人。我们要努力使青年处处遵守纪律、遵守一切法律，并随时随地向一切损害祖国利益的行为作坚决的斗争。我们要使青年都懂得，保卫祖国首先是青年的神圣的职责。我们青年团的全体团员要在这一切斗争中真正起模范带头作用。我相信，由伟大的中国共产党和毛主席教导的中国青年，在祖国伟大辉煌的事业中，必将贡献出自己的全部力量。
    彭真代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全拥护中央人民政府委员会所提出的中华人民共和国宪法草案和刘少奇同志关于这个宪法草案的报告。
    这个宪法草案，实事求是地总结了我国人民革命斗争的经验，总结了我国人民建国的经验，表达了我国人民的长期愿望。它不仅用法律形式肯定了我国人民已得的成果，并且明确地规定了我国人民进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造的目标和道路。它是我们各民族人民的利益和意志的最集中的表现。我提议我们的代表大会通过它，并且号召全国人民一致地为它的完满实现而奋斗。
    我们的宪法，是属于社会主义类型的宪法，它和资产阶级类型的宪法不同，它是完全为了人民的，是保护人民的权利和合法的利益的，是社会主义建设和社会主义改造的武器；中华人民共和国的每一个公民，不管是属于什么民族、种族、性别和职业，不管是什么社会出身，信仰不信仰宗教或者信仰什么宗教，也不管是不是共产党员，是不是国家工作人员，有多高的地位，有过多大的功劳，都应该无例外地遵守它。
      “法律面前人人平等”这个口号，在资本主义国家中，是不可能实行的，那里的劳动者，不可能同资产阶级在法律上获得实际的平等地位，因此，这个口号，在那里，只不过是资产阶级欺骗劳动人民、麻痹劳动人民的谎话，是有名无实的“民主”的幌子。在我们这里就根本不同，我们的国家是工人阶级领导的人民民主国家，我们全体公民在法律面前可能平等，也必须平等。人人遵守法律，人人在法律上平等，应当是，也必须是全体人民、全体国家工作人员和国家机关实际行动的指针。在我们这里，不允许言行不符，不允许有任何超于法律之外的特权分子。
    为了完满地实现我们的宪法，我们必须从各方面进行严肃的、复杂的斗争。我们必须提高警惕，反对帝国主义和国内反革命残余分子的阴谋破坏活动，必须反对各种抵抗社会主义改造的分子的破坏活动，必须和人民群众中各种违法现象进行斗争，必须对各种违法犯罪分子依法予以制裁。这不仅是公安机关、人民检察院和人民法院的责任，也是人民群众的责任。人民群众是专门机关的依靠，专门机关是人民群众的武器，二者必须紧密地结合起来，才能巩固我们国家的法制，维护宪法和法律的实施。
    为了保障宪法的顺利实现，维护国家的法制，我们还必须批判各种错误的思想。
    现在有这么一种人，他们自以为过去有过一点
  “功劳”或“苦劳”，就觉得了不起，觉得党和国家应该允许他们超于法律之外，允许他们为所欲为；他们不懂得人民的功臣应该戒骄戒躁，奉公守法，好好地作一个忠实的人民勤务员，争取功上加功，争取更大的光荣，在法律上，根本就不应该要求有任何特殊。国家对于一切违法犯罪的人，不管他过去有过什么功劳，都不能，也不应该加以包庇。这种功臣特殊的思想，实质上是骑在人民头上的封建地主和封建王侯思想的反映，是使我们的干部腐化堕落的思想，是毁灭我们干部的思想，甚至可以发展成为破坏我们的国家、破坏我们的党的思想，我们必须严厉地批判它和克服它。
    在少数国家工作人员中还有这么一种思想，他们以为法律是只管老百姓或者只管“小人物”的，至于“大干部”“大人物”，只要注意执行党和国家的方针政策就够了，对法律遵守不遵守，是无关重要的。这种思想，也是完全错误的。我们国家的法律并不是别的，它正是已经实现或正在实现中的方针政策的定型化，违背了法律就是违背了方针政策。我们的干部是人民的勤务员和领导者，国家对于干部的要求，在一切方面，都应该比对一般公民的要求高。干部不仅要执行方针政策，遵守政治纪律和工作纪律，还必须严格遵守国家的法律，成为遵守国家法律的模范。如果一个干部他本身就不遵守法律，那他还怎样能要求人民群众遵守法律呢？他还怎样能领导人民群众同违法现象作斗争，怎样能领导人民群众为执行党和国家的方针政策而奋斗呢？必须明确国家对于任何违法犯罪的人，不管他的职位多高，都是不能加以包庇的。
    还有一部分共产党员以为，共产党既然是国家的领导者，那么他们只要遵守党的纪律就行，对于遵守国家法律，似乎马虎一点也不要紧，这种思想，也是错误的、危险的。他们不知道党的纪律和国家法律是一致的。共产党对于一个党员的要求比国家对于一个公民的要求是严得多、高得多。共产党员的义务之一是模范地遵守国家的法律，违犯了国法，就是违犯了党纪，危害了党的利益，所以，中国共产党明确地规定：对于因违犯国法而受刑事处分的共产党员，是要开除党籍的。共产党员在遵守宪法和法律方面，是不能有任何例外、任何特殊的，如果硬要说有的话，那就是他们必须以身作则，成为守法的模范，并且团结群众为宪法和各种法律的实施而斗争。
    也有少数工人和农民同志认为，人民既然已经当家做主，就用不着再遵守什么法律。这种想法也是错误的。国家是自己的，国家的法律也是自己的，自己当了国家的主人，就可以不遵守自己国家的法律么？恰恰相反，应该严格地遵守。宪法和法律是我们人民经过自己的代表制定的，是表达我们人民的意志，保护我们人民的利益的，是我们对付敌人和坏分子的武器，我们为什么不遵守它，不运用它呢？如果我们自己不遵守它，不运用它，那么让谁来遵守，让谁来运用它呢？
    显然，上述各种错误思想，都是和我们的宪法草案的精神相违背的，都是宪法顺利实施的障碍。我们必须批判和克服这些错误思想。
    此外，还有一些人，他们在表面上似乎并不要求什么特权，但是，他们总想多享点权利，少尽点义务，甚至只追求法律所赋予的权利，不履行法律所规定的义务，这也是不对的。按照我们的宪法，公民在享受权利上是平等的，在履行义务上也是平等的，人人有应享的权利，人人有应尽的义务。不尽义务就是一种特权，我们的宪法是不承认这种特权的。那种“只享权利，不尽义务”的思想，实际上是一种损人利己，损公利私，牺牲最大多数人民的利益来满足个人利益的剥削思想，也就是一种特权思想，和我们的宪法草案的精神是背道而驰的，我们也必须严厉地批判和克服这种思想。
    我们的国家机关，在遵守法律方面，可不可以有什么特殊呢？不可以。按照我们的宪法草案，不仅国家机关工作人员，国家行政机关要严格遵守宪法和法律，国家的检察机关和审判机关要严格遵守宪法和法律，国家的各级权力机关，直至全国人民代表大会，也都要严格地遵守宪法和法律。一切认为国家机关可以违法的思想，实际上是一种“只许州官放火，不许百姓点灯”的反动统治阶级的思想，是和我们的宪法草案的精神根本不相容的，我们必须反对它。
    我们的宪法就要通过公布了，我国全体公民和所有的国家机关、民主党派、人民团体都必须严格地遵守宪法，都必须用宪法规定的标准来检查我们的思想和行动，并且和一切违法现象进行斗争。只有这样，才有可能使我们六万万人民万众一心，步伐整齐地，按照我们的宪法所规划的道路，向着繁荣幸福的社会主义社会大踏步地前进。
    沈钧儒代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我以人民代表的身份，参加这个会议，讨论和通过中华人民共和国宪法，我深深感觉到我们任务的光荣和责任的重大。
    通过这个宪法，就是向全世界宣布，六万万中国人自觉自愿地共同一致地决定了要走他们自己选定的道路，这不是封建主义的道路，也不是资本主义、帝国主义的道路。那些道路都是走不通的绝路。我们所要走的是唯一光明幸福的道路，是社会主义的道路。
    走这一条路是要稳步前进的。我们要完成社会主义建设和社会主义改造，来消灭剥削，消灭贫困，过渡到社会主义社会。我们的子子孙孙将要过着和过去不能相比的繁荣幸福和平快乐的日子。
    各位代表！这个宪法不是轻易得来的，它是一百多年来无数志士仁人拼头颅流鲜血换来的。实施这个宪法，更不是一件轻易的事，需要全国人民更坚强的团结起来，进行斗争和工作。
    各位代表！我们决不能忘记：台湾八百万人民还没有得到解放，蒋介石匪帮还没有全部消灭。我们决不能忘记：帝国主义好战分子还在进行侵略战争的阴谋。我们更不应忘记：已经消灭和将要消灭的阶级，决不甘心于被消灭，他们有的人还会企图复辟，有些人还会进行抵抗。我们对这些内外敌人必须时刻保持着高度的警惕。
    宪法通过，并不是我们的一切都就改变了。重要的是要改造我们一切从旧社会中生长的人们。我认为，各种知识分子，特别是国家工作人员，都要紧紧记住毛主席在一九四九年说过的几句话：“有了人民的国家，人民才有可能，在全国范围内和全体规模上，用民主的方法，教育自己和改造自己，使自己脱离内外反动派的影响……改造自己从旧社会得来的坏习惯和坏思想，不使自己走入反动派指引的错误路上去，并继续前进，向着社会主义社会和共产主义社会发展。”
    我是一个人民的法律工作者，我要继续同广大人民群众在一起，来竭尽全力地保卫宪法，并为宪法的实施而认真、积极地工作。过去五年中，我们各级人民法院在人民政府的领导下，处理了大量的刑事、民事案件，保障了国家恢复时期各项运动的完成和国家经济建设的顺利进行。但是各级人民法院在执行国家的审判任务中，曾发生了一些缺点和错误。首先应该指出的，是旧法观点和旧司法作风在审判工作上所造成的缺点和错误。这种观点和作风，虽在司法改革运动中已经受到了致命的打击，但今后还须继续注意予以肃清。有些审判人员在办案中只凭主观臆断，缺乏民主作风，因而造成了个别案件的错判，侵犯了人民的民主权利。这是和宪法所揭示的要求不相容的。目前最高人民法院和司法部正在继续结合法院的民主制度建设，对全国各级人民法院进行关于审判人员的民主作风和守法精神的教育。我相信，全国各级人民法院在人民群众的监督下，是能够迅速而认真地改善工作情况，适应宪法公布后的实际需要的。
    各位代表！我完全拥护刘少奇委员关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告，并建议全体代表一致投票通过中华人民共和国宪法，并且抱定决心，更加百倍地努力工作，实施这个宪法，使我们伟大的祖国顺利地过渡到社会主义社会。
    李顺达代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    自从宪法草案公布后，我已听过四次报告，参加过十三次讨论，一次比一次清楚。特别是又听了刘少奇同志的报告，使我更亲切地感到我们的宪法草案，每一条每一句都合乎我们的心愿。这是我国从古以来没有过的人民宪法，我十分满意，完全拥护。
    我们在村里讨论宪法草案的时候，大家特别喜欢的是宪法巩固了我们的革命成果。我们每个人都回想了过去，在抗战前受地主压迫，农民没有说话权，不用说来北京，就连村公所也进不去。我们全村二十户就有十七户租种地主的土地。我家六口人劳动一年，除交租外，成年吃不到一顿饱饭。地主家的牲口每天还要吃四、五斤料，我家一个人每天吃不到半斤粮。抗战后，在共产党和毛主席领导下，农民翻了身，生活改善了。劳动人民都能管理国家大事。以我来说，我是乡、县、省人民代表大会的代表，这次又被选为全国人民代表大会代表。战前我们全乡只有一座小学，现在有四座小学，六座民校，青壮年大半都识了字。还有医疗所、接生站、电话机和收音机。现在我们的宪法把这些革命成果都巩固起来了，这不但保证我们不再受罪，而且保证我们越来越幸福。
    同时，大家最满意的是：在宪法草案上肯定了我们走互助合作的道路。我们村在一九四三年就响应毛主席号召，组织了互助组，一九五一年十二月，在互助组的基础上成立了农林畜牧生产合作社，两年多以来已经由二十六户发展到二百零三户。我们乡在太行山里，土薄石厚，每人平均不足二亩地，在组织起来以前，每亩土地平均只能打一百八十斤粮食，组织起来后，产量年年提高，现在每亩最高能打一千一百多斤，平均每亩能打三百五十斤粮食，比以前增产百分之九十四。最近两年来，我们合作社在荒山播种树林六百多亩，并栽活了两千多株果木树，还养了七百多只羊。我们的生产和收入，不断地增加，生活年年有改善，我们大家越来越盼望社会主义社会早日到来。
    宪法草案公布后，加强了我们建成社会主义社会的信心，我们在乡人民代表大会会议上，讨论了全乡十五年农、林、牧生产建设计划，这个计划实现后，每人每年平均就可以有三千斤以上粮食的收入，这个幸福的远景，时时刻刻鼓舞着我们每个人。最近我又听到我国有些地区遭了水灾，为支援灾区同胞，大家的生产劲头更大了，今年我们社的庄稼长得很好，我们有把握完成每亩增产五十三斤粮食的计划。
    宪法规定了国家要逐步完成对农业的社会主义改造。我们西沟乡很有信心来完成这个光荣的任务。但我感到自己的知识、经验很不够，工作上还有很多缺点。因此我要虚心向全国各地的劳动模范学习，更要认真学习苏联的先进经验。我们知道，要实现社会主义建设，就要依靠工人阶级领导，巩固工农联盟，支援社会主义工业化，就要更加巩固人民民主制度，积极支援人民解放军解放台湾，保卫我们祖国的安全，我们每个农民都要为实现这些任务而奋斗。
    蔡畅代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我衷心赞同和热烈拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案和刘少奇同志关于宪法草案的报告。从中华人民共和国宪法草案公布以来，三个月中，广大妇女群众认真学习和热烈讨论了宪法草案，大家一致认为中华人民共和国宪法草案是我国人民革命的成果，是中华人民共和国建立以来政治上、经济上的新胜利的总结，它反映了国家过渡时期广大人民建设社会主义社会的根本要求和共同愿望；对妇女来说，宪法草案又肯定了五年来我国妇女已经获得的权利，指出了进一步保障男女平等、保护妇女儿童权益的根本途径。全国妇女为此而欢欣鼓舞，热烈拥护，并坚决表示要为实现宪法、保卫宪法而奋斗。
    中华人民共和国成立以来，根本改变了旧社会中妇女被压迫被奴役的状态，妇女已经同男子一样成为国家的主人翁，在政治、经济、文化等方面同男子享有同等的权利；这就极大地鼓舞了妇女热爱祖国，积极参加抗美援朝、社会改革和国家建设工作的热情和积极性。五年来，参加社会主义工业建设的妇女大量增加，一九五三年全国国营和公私合营企业中的女职工数量就比一九五一年增加了百分之五十二。男女同工同酬的原则已经基本实施，劳动保险条例也正在规定范围内逐步施行着。在农村里，大批妇女参加了以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动，增进了农村妇女对生产的贡献。妇女们又广泛地参加了其他各项国家建设和社会活动，她们都能认真学习，做好工作。在这次全国普选运动中被选为人民代表的妇女平均占代表总数的百分之十七点三一。在各级人民代表大会和各级人民政府中，也都有不少妇女参加并担任负责工作。在学校中，女学生的数量逐年增加，其中劳动人民的女儿入校的数量，更有显著的增加。在宣传和贯彻婚姻法以后，出现了大批民主和睦、团结生产的新家庭，提高了妇女的家庭地位，树立了夫妇、婆媳相互尊爱的新风气。在各种工作岗位上与广大家庭中，都涌现了不少热爱祖国、热爱社会主义、积极劳动生产和在群众中有威望的妇女骨干及妇女劳动模范，她们为广大妇女参加祖国建设树立了良好的榜样。
    在学习和讨论宪法草案中，我们妇女也充分认识到要更进一步实现男女完全平等，必须经过艰苦复杂的工作，因为在社会上以及在妇女自身都还存在着不少障碍和困难。为此，我们妇女必须继续提高爱国主义、社会主义觉悟，克服封建残余思想和资产阶级思想，努力学习和提高自己的生产和工作的能力，热烈响应祖国的号召，积极参加祖国的社会主义建设工作，努力行使宪法所赋予妇女的各项权力。
    奴役妇女的时代永远过去了。中华人民共和国宪法照亮了我们走向社会主义的道路，照亮了我们妇女彻底解放的道路。让我们全国妇女紧紧地团结在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的周围，为贯彻实施中华人民共和国宪法，为逐步过渡到社会主义社会，为妇女的彻底解放而继续努力！
    班禅额尔德尼·却吉坚赞代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我这次同达赖喇嘛及其他代表，来到我们伟大的首都北京参加我国第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，并同全国各兄弟民族的代表欢聚一堂，讨论和通过中华人民共和国宪法，这在我国的历史上还是第一次，我以能够出席这样一个有伟大历史意义的会议，感到无上的光荣和无比的兴奋。
    中华人民共和国宪法草案，我们经过反复的学习和讨论，我认为这个宪法草案是完全正确的，是完全代表全国各族人民切身利益和共同愿望的。只有这样的一个宪法，才能真正保护少数民族的平等权利；只有这样的一个宪法，才能巩固我国人民革命的胜利成果；只有这样的一个宪法，才能引导我国各族人民坚定地向着社会主义的幸福道路胜利前进。因此，我对中华人民共和国宪法草案，完全同意，并表示衷心拥护。
    伟大的中国共产党和各族人民敬爱的领袖毛主席，领导我国人民取得了人民革命的伟大胜利，使西藏获得了和平解放，西藏人民永远地摆脱了帝国主义羁绊，光荣地回到了我们友爱和睦的祖国大家庭。短短的三年多来，我们在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席英明领导和亲切关怀帮助下，西藏的政治、经济和文化等各方面都得到了重大的成就，宗教信仰自由得到了很好的保护，风俗习惯得到了很好的尊重。单就经济、文化来说就有了新的发展，如发放无息农牧贷款，兴修水利，救济灾民，使群众生活得到了些改善，设立医院给群众免费治疗，使群众减少了疾病痛苦；开办小学，使我藏族子弟有了良好的入学机会。尤其在团结方面，西藏民族内部的团结以及藏族同各兄弟民族之间的团结已日益加强。三年多来，活生生的具体事实，使我们深切体会到中国共产党毛主席的民族政策是伟大的正确的，全国各兄弟民族对西藏人民是热爱和帮助的。有了中国共产党和毛主席的领导，有了各兄弟民族的帮助和合作，西藏人民才能享受到祖国大家庭的温暖，才能真正摆脱掉帝国主义的欺骗和奴役，政治、经济和文化才能得到发展。在这里，我特别要向伟大的中国共产党和各族人民的救星毛主席，致以崇高的敬意。
    主席，各位代表！西藏民族和西藏人民在过去长期遭受帝国主义的侵略压迫。西藏人民都认清了帝国主义的狰狞面貌，都痛恨和坚决反对帝国主义的阴谋挑拨和破坏。回到祖国大家庭的西藏人民，日益热爱我们伟大的祖国和坚信中央人民政府的领导，深愿祖国日益强大和巩固。我们深深地知道：强大繁荣的祖国，一定会给西藏人民带来无限的光明和幸福。我们将永远团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，同达赖喇嘛一起，以自己的实际行动，继续加强和巩固我藏族内部的团结以及藏族同各兄弟民族之间的团结，并同中国人民解放军驻藏的人员以及全西藏僧俗人民一道，更加热爱祖国，建设祖国大家庭，巩固祖国的国防，时刻警惕地防止帝国主义的挑拨和破坏，并为彻底实现和平协议，遵守人民的宪法、建设繁荣幸福的新西藏而奋斗到底。
    敬祝各位代表身体健康！
    敬祝大会胜利成功！
    刘兰畦代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我是一个平凡的小学教师，这次当选为全国人民代表大会代表来京开会，我越想越高兴，真不知道要用什么话才能表达出我的兴奋的心情。我首先想到的是：要不是中国共产党和毛主席领导着人民革命取得了胜利，建立了人民民主政权，那会有这个大喜的日子。
    在国民党反动派统治的旧社会里，教育是不被重视的，儿童也得不到应有的关怀，教师们都认为教书是末路，教小学更是没出息，女教师受气的地方就更多了。我教了快三十年的书，虽然我热爱儿童，热爱小学教育工作，但是那时候只有苦恼，只有受气，以为这一生就算完了。可是在新中国里，中国共产党和人民政府特别重视人民教育，特别关怀儿童。我们小学教师就在党和政府不断的教育和关怀下，政治地位提高了，生活有保障了，政治觉悟也在不断地提高，地方各级人民代表大会代表中有不少的小学教师。今天我这个小学教师居然坐在这庄严而隆重的大会上来参加制定宪法，就说明小学教育事业在我们国家中已成为光荣的事业，真正作为一个人民的小学教师是光荣的。因此我更加热爱儿童，热爱我的小学教育工作！
    宪法记录了我们人民革命胜利的成果和人民的愿望，还特别对人民的教育作了很好的规定。我热烈拥护这部人民的宪法。
    根据宪法的精神来检查我们的小学教育工作，我们小学教育中不可否认地是存在着某些缺点和偏向的。例如：宪法草案上明确地提出：“劳动是中华人民共和国一切有劳动能力的公民的光荣的事情。”“中华人民共和国公民有劳动的权利。”但我们在小学教育中是严重地存在着轻视劳动教育的偏向的，有些高小毕业生升不了学就认为没有前途，不愿从事工农业生产劳动。这种轻视劳动的思想，实质上是资产阶级的剥削思想。
    小学教育的目的和任务，在于教育和培养我们的后一代成为建设社会主义社会的新生力量。社会主义社会的每一个公民都必须认识劳动是光荣的事情和应有的权利，因此，今后小学教育中必须认真加强劳动教育来体现人民宪法的真正精神和实质。
    在小学中进行社会主义思想教育，特别是劳动教育，关键在于克服小学教师中轻视劳动的资产阶级的剥削思想，逐步树立社会主义教育的劳动思想，这就要求必须加强小学教师的思想改造和业务学习，加强对小学校长及教导主任的教育、培养和思想领导。
    最后，宪法就要通过公布了，这就要求我自己必须严格地同全国小学教师们一道共同努力，加强学习，提高教学质量，检查、批判和清除资产阶级教育思想，逐步树立社会主义教育思想，培养社会主义社会的公民，来贯彻执行宪法，拥护宪法。
    诸福棠代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我是北京市的医务工作者，小儿科医生，今天能够参加这个大会，感到非常光荣。
    听了刘少奇同志关于宪法草案的报告，我感觉到宪法草案是中国共产党和毛主席三十多年来领导全国人民艰苦奋斗的胜利果实，也是全国人民逐步完成国家在过渡时期总任务的奋斗目标。它是真正地代表着全国人民共同的意志，我对于这个宪法草案完全同意并且衷心地拥护。
    宪法草案的内容给了我们医务工作者很大的鼓励。解放以前，在封建主义、帝国主义和官僚资本主义的重重压迫之下，根本就谈不到卫生设施，就是有一些医疗机构，也只是为极少数的人服务的。中华人民共和国成立以后，广大的工人和干部都享受了劳动保险和公费医疗的待遇。现在宪法草案又规定了劳动者在年老、疾病或者丧失劳动能力的时候，可以得到物质的帮助，国家要举办社会保险、社会救济和群众卫生事业，并且要逐步扩大这些设施。宪法草案又规定国家要逐步扩充劳动人民的休息和休养的物质条件。这些设施，无疑地将要进一步提高全国劳动人民的幸福生活。
    宪法草案特别提出了母亲和儿童受到国家的保护。这种对于新一代的重视只有人民民主国家和社会主义国家才能做得到。解放以前，我国的婴儿死亡率非常高，达到千分之二百以上，产妇的生命是没有保障的。这几年来人民政府办了许多妇幼保健事业，培养和改造了二十多万名接生员，开办了好几万个托儿所，产妇和婴儿的死亡率已经大大减低了。在一些少数民族地区，扭转了过去人口减少的现象。从今以后，劳动人民的子女将要永远得到健康和快乐的生活。
    宪法草案对于卫生事业的重视，对于教育工作和科学研究工作的重视，也大大鼓舞了我们医务工作者的积极性和创造性。就拿我个人的体验来说，从前在反动统治时代，我们要想办一个医院，做一些医学研究工作，是没有人来支持的。现在就大不相同了。早在一九五一年的秋天，北京市人民政府为了爱护首都的儿童，就计划了一个规模相当大、并且具有教育设备的儿童医院。在这个医院的附近，现在又保留了一块空地，准备设立儿童保健研究所。这些都是我们在解放以前绝对梦想不到的事情，但是现在呢，这些具体的事实深深地感动我，觉得做一个新中国的医务工作者，能有这样好的机会，来参加祖国的建设事业，真是最大的光荣！
    新中国的卫生事业有肯定的成绩，但是也有缺点。首先，我们的医疗工作，质量不够好，还远远赶不上人民的需要。一方面是由于一部分的工作人员有个人自由主义和官僚主义，对于病人缺乏高度的责任心和同情心，对于这些医务人员，必须加强政治思想的领导。另一方面，一般干部的技术水平不够，应当加强业务学习。有些做领导工作的医务同志，应当改善领导的工作方法，把他们主要的精力放在培养干部的工作上。
      关于医学科学研究工作，我们也做得很不够。我们必须吸收世界各国的、特别是苏联先进的医学的成就，提高自己的医学水平，才能更好地为人民服务。我们也必须要贯彻爱国主义的精神，并且要掌握理论和实际结合的原则。因此，我们西医一定要响应毛主席的号召，彻底纠正宗派主义的思想，认真地、虚心地跟中医学习。并且对于中医中药的精华部分，做出广泛而且深入的研究。我相信中西医紧密团结之后，一定会发扬和光大祖国的文化遗产，建立一个新中国统一的、具有近代科学性、并且具有民族特点的医学体系。同时，为了使医学科学研究工作和国家的经济建设很好地配合起来，我们必须重视工矿卫生的实际问题和广大农村地方病问题。
    我决心在卫生工作的岗位上，用实际的行动来拥护我国人民自己制定的宪法。我们医务工作者一定要好好团结，提高工作质量，努力学习苏联先进的医疗预防、医学教育和医学研究的制度和方法，办好我们人民的医院、医学院和其他卫生事业。
    最后我们医务工作者一定要时刻准备着，用全部力量来支援解放台湾的斗争，直到在水深火热中受着苦难的台湾同胞、以及台湾的医务工作者，都可以像我们自己一样享受到自由、幸福和和平的生活。
    陈叔通代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    放在我们面前的宪法草案，经过各民主党派、各人民团体、各民主阶级和全国广大人民群众将近六个月的讨论，并由宪法起草委员会考虑了各方面提出的意见，进行了必要的修改。刘少奇委员对于这个宪法草案又做了详尽的报告，说明了它的基本内容。我深深相信，第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议将庄严地一致地通过这一个我国人民自己的宪法，这是一件具有历史意义的大事。
    这个宪法代表着以中国工人阶级为领导的六亿人民的意志，巩固了中国人民在中国共产党领导下所获得的伟大成果，反映了广大人民建设社会主义的共同愿望，肯定了国家在过渡时期的总任务，是引导中国人民胜利地通过和平道路建成社会主义社会的明确指针。
    这个宪法是在毛主席亲自领导和亲自参加下写成的，是完全从实际出发因而是符合于中国具体情况的，是原则性和灵活性相结合的光辉范例，是伟大的毛泽东思想的具体体现。我衷心地拥护这一伟大的宪法，并愿为其完全实现而奋斗。
    这个宪法的意义是无限伟大的，它的内容是无限丰富的。为了使全国人民能够更深入地了解我国宪法的伟大意义和丰富内容，为了使全国人民明确认识我们国家所应该走的道路和方向，也为了使这个宪法能够在各个方面一致贯彻和执行，我建议，在宪法公布以后，应该在全国范围内展开广泛的宣传和经常的学习。这是因为宪法所规定的建成社会主义社会的道路对全国人民来说，是一条新的道路。这条道路，正在开始走，还没有足够的经验，所以还必须努力地学习，虚心地学习，全面地学习，切切实实地学习。只有加强宣传和学习，使大家都懂得、都了解，全国人民才能够遵循宪法所指出的道路，走得更顺利，贯彻得更彻底。
    其次，要使宪法彻底贯彻，全国人民还必须运用批评和自我批评的武器，自我改造，树立守法的精神。宪法草案第一百条规定：“中华人民共和国公民必须遵守宪法和法律，遵守劳动纪律，遵守公共秩序，尊重社会公德。”只有全国人民都懂得守法，而且是上下一致地守法以后，建设社会主义的事业，才能获得胜利前进的重大保证。
    建国五年以来，全国人民和国家机关工作人员，忠公体国，勤奋努力，在各个战线上都获得了伟大的成就，这是完全肯定的。但是我们也不讳言，工作还是有缺点的，也曾经有过官僚主义、命令主义和某些违法乱纪的现象。遵照毛主席在人民政协第一届全国委员会第四次会议上的指示，很迅速地把这些坏的现象基本上克服过来了。这并不是说不会再发生。现在，宪法草案第十七条和第十八条把毛主席这个正确的指示总结进去了，今后一定要遵照毛主席的指示和宪法的规定办事；同时，也希望我们的检察机关能够切实行使检察的职权，使我们国家的宪法和法律，能够得到一切国家机关、国家干部和全体公民的遵守。
    但是，仅仅依靠检察机关，还是不够的，我们还必须依靠广大人民的监督。宪法草案第十七条和第九十七条对于人民的监督权和控告权已作了明确的规定。全国人民应该正确地运用监督权和控告权，这样才能保证克服官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的现象。
    毛主席说：“这些毛病都去掉了，我们的国家计划建设就一定会成功，人民民主制度就一定会发展，帝国主义的阴谋就一定会失败，我们就一定能够取得完全的胜利！”
    让我们为宪法的彻底实行，为争取社会主义的完全胜利而欢呼！
    最后，保卫国家的主权、领土完整和安全，是中国人民的神圣任务。这个神圣任务已经明确地规定在宪法草案的第二十条上。台湾是中国的一省，台湾是中国的领土，台湾是中华人民共和国不可分离的一部分，但是台湾尚被蒋介石卖国集团在美帝国主义者庇护下盘踞着。全国人民已庄严地发出誓言：中国人民一定要解放台湾。我们必须履行这个庄严的誓言，我们必须实现宪法所规定的神圣任务，我们必须为解放台湾而坚决奋斗。
    张经武代表的发言主席团、各位代表：
    我完全拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案和刘少奇同志关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告，根据我在西藏地区工作中的体会，证明了中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的民族政策是完全正确的。宪法草案中所规定的国家在过渡时期的总任务，是完全符合于我国各少数民族的发展前途的。这个宪法是以一九四九年中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领为基础的，又是共同纲领的发展。依据共同纲领的原则而签订的和平解放西藏办法的协议同宪法的精神不相抵触，因此它是继续有效并且应当继续加以执行的。西藏民族在伟大祖国的创造与发展中，曾经尽了自己的光荣的责任，西藏回到祖国大家庭中来之后，完成了祖国大陆的统一。宪法草案中指出：
  “中华人民共和国是统一的多民族的国家。”“我国各民族已经团结成为一个自由平等的民族大家庭。”是完全切合实际的。但是，帝国主义和反动分子是不会甘心他们的失败的，他们还在继续进行挑拨汉、藏民族的关系，破坏祖国的统一的阴谋活动。我们必须提高警惕，随时随地揭破帝国主义和反动分子的挑拨和阴谋。我们必须加强爱国主义教育，充分发挥广泛的人民民主统一战线的作用，在反帝爱国的旗帜下继续团结前进。
    宪法规定的各民族一律平等的政策，是巩固祖国的统一和各民族的团结的坚固的政治基础。由于历史原因，西藏地区的民族团结更有它的重大意义。在执行和平协议的工作中，我们坚持了同当地同人民有联系的上层人士长期团结，长期合作，并为人民服务的方针。这对于加强汉、藏民族之间和西藏内部的团结上是很重要的，我们今后还要继续坚持这个方针。我相信今后民族团结是会更加巩固和发展的。
    宪法草案序言和第六十七条、七十二条的规定，完全符合于西藏人民的利益和适合西藏现在和将来发展的具体情况。过去，由于条件限制，我们对西藏人民的帮助是很不够的，但是这种帮助会逐渐地增加起来。西藏人民同祖国各民族人民一样，是勤劳勇敢的，西藏的前途是很光明的。将来西藏实行区域自治，实行有利于西藏民族的改革事宜，自然要由西藏人民同人民有联系的领袖人士自己协商进行。汉族干部和汉族人民将根据西藏人民及其领袖人物的需要，尽到帮助的责任。我们过去在执行和平协议和民族平等团结政策的工作中，有许多的缺点和错误，最主要的是一部分汉族干部中存在着大民族主义思想残余，有大民族的优越感，对民族政策思想体会不深；同藏族干部共同工作时，对他们尊重不够，缺乏民主协商办事的精神，产生包办代替的现象。有些汉族干部不注意研究西藏地区的具体情况和民族特点，在思想方法上还有不少的主观主义和急躁情绪，在工作中采取命令主义的方法。个别干部甚至发生过违法乱纪的行为。这些或多或少存在着的大汉族主义的思想和作风，使西藏工作受到了一些阻碍，对于建设祖国是不利的。另一方面，在一部分藏族干部中也还存在着程度不同的地方民族主义倾向，这对于建设祖国大家庭同样是不利的，对于西藏的团结进步和发展也是不利的。上述大汉族主义和地方民族主义倾向，经过汉、藏两族领导人员的努力，都已逐步有所纠正。现在宪法草案上明文规定各民族一律平等，禁止任何民族的歧视和压迫，禁止破坏各民族团结的行为，反对大民族主义和地方民族主义，这是完全必要的和正确的。今后我们保证坚决执行宪法，在西藏地区工作的汉族干部，必须经常严格检查自己的思想和作风，以更进一步地加强祖国各民族的团结，特别是汉、藏民族之间和西藏内部的团结。我们一定根据宪法的精神，根据十七条协议和西藏的具体情况，为建设西藏、巩固国防、逐步实现国家在过渡时期的总任务而努力！
    朱德海代表的发言主席团、各位代表：
    我衷心拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案，完全同意刘少奇委员关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告。
    自从中央人民政府公布宪法草案后，吉林省延边朝鲜族自治区人民，展开了广泛的宣传讨论，他们说：“我们所享受的民族平等权利，在国家根本大法里固定下来了，今后我们将永久享受这样的权利，我们坚决用实际行动拥护这个宪法。”
    解放前，延边朝鲜族人民同各兄弟民族一样，在日本帝国主义和封建势力反动统治下，受尽了民族压迫，过着牛马不如的生活。朝鲜族人民曾经同各兄弟民族一道，进行过反对帝国主义、封建势力的英勇斗争，终于在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，获得了解放。
    解放后，朝鲜族人民在中国共产党和毛主席的伟大民族政策的照耀下，享受着民族平等权利，在政治、经济、文化各方面都获得了迅速的发展。我们有信心同先进的汉族一道，共同过渡到繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。
    根据“中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要”的规定，延边朝鲜族聚居区于一九五二年九月建立了延边朝鲜族自治区，进一步实现了民族自治的权利。现在农村中参加农业生产互助合作的农户，已占全体农户的百分之八六·二，在明年春耕以前，全区将有百分之五十以上的农户参加农业生产合作社。地方国营工业也有了很大的发展，自治区在国家帮助下，已建立和扩建了四十四个地方国营企业。随着工农业生产的发展，人民购买力大大提高，一九五三年全区人民平均购买力就比伪满时期提高了五倍半。文化教育也有相应的发展，解放后创办了一所综合性大学，就是延边大学；现有中等学校四十二所；小学校四百多所，自治区就学儿童已达学龄儿童的百分之九十五。自治区根本上已控制了为害严重的霍乱病和其他传染病的发生。所有这些事实，都证明了中国共产党和毛主席的民族政策的正确。
    但是由于我们的政策理论水平不高，对于中国共产党和毛主席的民族政策体会不深，在实际工作中还存在着许多错误和缺点，如对区内的各兄弟民族照顾不够，对经济建设的重点不够明确，在文化教育方面曾有冒进的偏向等等。我们今后必须戒骄戒躁，努力学习民族政策，虚心学习各兄弟民族的经验，在今后工作中努力克服我们的错误和缺点。
    我们的宪法巩固了各民族人民革命斗争胜利的成果，集中地反映了各民族的共同愿望，并有力地鼓舞了各少数民族参加祖国建设事业的热情。我们决心以实际行动拥护宪法，遵守宪法，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席领导下，为完成祖国的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业而奋斗！
    黄炎培代表的发言主席、各位代表！
    我对中华人民共和国宪法草案和刘少奇同志的报告，完全同意。
    这部宪法草案，从今年三月二十三日第一次召开宪法起草委员会到九月九日在中央人民政府委员会修正通过，前前后后征集到各方面意见多少条呢？一百一十八万多条。全部宪草多少字呢？八千九百五十四个字，而中间“人民”一个名词有多少呢？有两百六十二个。
    我来报告一件事实，有一位地方基层组织的工作女同志，在她向人民群众传达了宪法草案之后，向我说：人民群众初听到“宪法”两个字，完全不懂。说：“怎么叫做宪法？”等到把一条一条讲给他们听了之后，大家跳起来了。说：“那么，这宪法完全是为了我们搞起来的了。我们要好好学习，好好照着它做才是。”这一件事，这几句话，恰恰足够地代表一般人民群众对这部宪法内心的表现，这种种都是说明这部宪法真正是人民的宪法。
    这部宪法草案规定着中华人民共和国美丽的远景，要社会主义工业化，要社会主义改造，来逐步消灭剥削制度，建立社会主义社会。在这过程中间，对于农民，对于手工业者，对于非农业的个体劳动者，对于资本家，都规定了国家依照法律保护他们的生产资料所有权，同时对于一般公民，规定了国家保护他们的生活资料所有权，而对于资本家，在依照法律保护生产资料所有权之下，还加上“其他资本所有权”，这就说明资本主义工商业，如果能够发挥有利于国计民生的积极作用，那不但是有生产产品作用的工业，就是没有生产产品作用的商业，它的资本所有权，同样在国家依照法律保护范围之内。但必须接受国家的鼓励和指导，把这些资本主义工商业转变为国家资本主义经济，逐步用全民所有制来代替资本家所有制，这对资本主义工商业的照顾是符合实际的了。刘少奇同志报告中说：“民族资产阶级过去曾经在工人阶级领导下参加了民族民主革命，五年以来又在国家领导下参加了爱国运动和经济恢复的工作”，刘少奇同志还说：“在过渡时期，民族资产阶级在国民经济中还有重要的作用”。从这种种看来，私营工商业者们！国家这样期待着，你们在这部宪法公布以后，将怎样更进一步为了发挥有利于国计民生的积极作用，积极接受社会主义改造而努力呢！
      一部句斟字酌的宪法，大会通过了，政府公布了，它本身会发生作用么？不会的。必须每一个国家机关工作人员和全国人民大家好好地一字一句地照着它做。我有一种顾虑，五年以来，中央人民政府在中国共产党毛主席领导下，规定各种政策，从政策本身来说，是正确的，可是施行到各地方去，反映好的固然很多，有些地方，还存在着不少问题，有的还发生偏差。政府颁布一种新的很好的法令，为了执行有问题，会使一部分人民会受到相反的影响。举一个例子吧！婚姻法解放了几千年来被压迫的妇女，当然是大大地为人民造福的了。施行以来，是造福吗？是造福的；但在施行的初期，有若干地方问题很多很多。因此，我万分恳切要求各方各面对于宪法予以高度的重视来正确执行，所有领导、管理、监督、检察各方面对于宪法执行工作，特别予以严重注视，各级人民代表大会代表们更须正确反映人民群众对于国家机关工作的意见，发现了困难或偏差，必须全国上下一致努力来克服，来纠正。
    刘少奇同志说：“宪法草案，是中国人民一百多年以来英勇斗争的历史经验的总结”。依我想来，过去中国人民革命一幕又一幕，失败又失败，要是没有中国共产党正确领导，那会有今天！解放后的中国，通过了新民主主义，望着社会主义道路前进，要是没有中国共产党正确领导，又那会有明天！我在今天新中国经济建设开始、制宪工作快要完成的时候，特向伟大的中国共产党、伟大的毛主席致崇高的敬意！
    周鲠生代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    制定宪法是中华人民共和国成立以来国家最重大的事业之一，也就是第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的首要任务。这一任务的胜利完成，将是大会这次会议的光荣。
    自中华人民共和国宪法草案公布以来，大家经过座谈讨论，对于宪法草案的内容已有一般的认识。这次听了刘少奇委员关于宪法草案的报告之后，我们对于这个宪法草案的历史背景、基本精神和特点，获得了更清楚的认识。这个宪法草案经过全国人民代表大会通过之后，就将成为全体人民和一切国家机关都共同遵守的根本法。这是真正人民的宪法，是代表人民的意志，符合人民的利益，为人民服务的宪法。它巩固人民民主专政，奠定国家的法制基础，保证国家通过和平道路达到社会主义社会。
      从本年三月由中共中央提出中华人民共和国宪法草案初稿到本月九日中央人民政府委员会修正通过宪法草案，提交全国人民代表大会，这一过程历时半年以上。中间经过各民主党派、人民团体等组织的座谈讨论，经过全民讨论，最近又经过全国人民代表大会代表的分组讨论，吸收了多方面的意见。经过宪法起草委员会反复研究讨论，许多意见反映在宪法草案的补充和修正条文上。一国宪法的起草工作，这样的审慎周详，集思广益，在世界各国的宪法中，除开苏联和各人民民主国家的宪法以外，是找不出先例的。即此一端，已足以表现我们这个宪法草案的民主性。还有一点值得特别指出的是，宪法草案的全部条文都是用白话写成。宪法文字用白话体是我国法律文字上一个革命。这就使得宪法文字尽可能的大众化，便于广大人民群众的了解和掌握。
    作为一个人民的宪法，我们的宪法草案是使用了符合人民要求的文字的。
    我们的国家是走社会主义的道路；宪法草案也自然属于社会主义宪法的类型。可是我们现在尚在走向社会主义社会的过渡时期，这一过渡时期的宪法，就同已经达到社会主义社会的国家的宪法，在若干方面，自然有所区别。在经济方面，我们现在尚承认资本家所有制。在人民民主之下，以中国共产党为领导的人民民主统一战线的继续发挥作用，也在宪法草案序言中被肯定了；并且这一政治特点的照顾也反映在宪法的某些条文上。我们的国家生活各方面正在急速地发展。宪法反映正在现实生活中发生着的变化，也反映这种变化所趋向的目标。这就是如宪法草案序言中所说，“这个宪法巩固了我国人民革命的成果和中华人民共和国建立以来政治上、经济上的新胜利，并且反映了国家在过渡时期的根本要求和广大人民建设社会主义社会的共同愿望。”因之，宪法草案的有些部分带着纲领性，是必然的事。它是以共同纲领为基础，是总结了多年的革命和建设的经验，它是从实事求是的精神出发，而不是凭空臆造的。我们可以看出每一个条文都有它的一定的意义和内容，都具着实行性。这又是宪法草案的一个优点。
    宪法草案的一个基本特点是实现彻底的民主主义。民主原则一贯实现于我们的政治制度。
      共同纲领所定的人民代表大会制，在宪法中被肯定下来，内容也规定详备了。我们的国家行政机关，从国务院到地方各级人民委员会，质言之，我们的中央和地方政府，都由出自间接或直接选举的人民代表大会这样的国家权力机关产生，受它们的监督，并可以由它们罢免。而组成国家权力机关的人民代表都受原选举单位或选民的监督，可以由他们罢免。在资产阶级社会的所谓民主之下，统治的剥削阶级，政府人员和国会议员，骑在人民头上；我们的国家机关负责人员连同中华人民共和国主席在内，都是为人民服务的，是人民的勤务员。在我们的国家，人民才真正当家作主。
    同时，国家机关一律实行民主集中制，按照民主集中原则，在民主的基础上实行集中领导，就可以发挥国家管理的高度效能。我们的政治制度是真正的民主，是实行社会主义的民主主义。
    民主原则又反映于全体公民在法律上一律平等；反映于普遍的选举制。我们的选举制是真正的普选，不像资本主义国家之名为普选而实际依种族、宗教、财产状况等等差别，剥夺许多公民的选举权。民主原则也实现于少数民族权利、利益的保障。宪法草案反映新中国实行的正确的民族政策，首先宣布各民族一律平等，肯定各民族地方实行区域自治。在宪法上多方面照顾少数民族的利益、特点和需要。这样的民族政策，正是发挥社会主义的民主主义的精神，将大大地有助于巩固民族团结，发展民族间友爱互助的关系。
      最后，宪法草案规定公民的基本权利，不以作形式上的规定为限，而进一层的规定到保证权利的享受所需要的物质条件，如关于劳动权、受教育权。这也是社会主义的民主宪法的特点。我们的宪法上保障的公民权利是要兑现的，不是空头支票；同时，宪法上规定的公民义务也是必须遵守的，不能视为具文。
    总之，提交大会的这个宪法草案，无论从它的实质或形式看，将是国家一个很好的宪法，是一个适合过渡时期国家总任务的需要和人民要求的宪法，虽则不能说绝对不会发现有缺点。但是，如刘少奇委员的报告所指出，这并不是说，宪法颁布之后，“宪法所规定的任何条文就都会自然而然地实现起来”。宪法规定的实施，尚需要有配合实施的具体条件。而事实上按我们的国家现实状况，在实施宪法部分的条文上显然尚欠缺某些条件，是不必讳言的。
        举少数显著的例子来说吧。国家保证公民的劳动权、受教育权，就有劳动就业、学校设备问题。实施法院和检察院制度，就发生法律工作干部问题。宪法保护公民的私有财产继承权，而国家现在尚没有规定继承的民法。宪法上所说的公民，牵连到国籍问题，而国家现在尚没有颁布国籍法。固然在事实上向来根据政策、指示、习惯和具体情况，也能解决这一些法律上的问题，但是在宪法颁布之后，我们要遵照宪法的原则办事，终久不能不有确定的法规来作决定。不过这只是说，在宪法实施的时候，我们不要忽视这一类的困难；这并不意味着现在某些物质条件的欠缺就妨害宪法的实行。我相信这一类的困难是可以克服的，是一定要克服的；我们当然要努力创造条件。
    中华人民共和国成立刚到五年而进行这样一个宪法的制定，这一事实就有广大的国际意义。中华人民共和国宪法的产生，标志着在共产党领导下中国人民革命的伟大成就，反映着中国人民通过和平道路建设社会主义社会的坚强信心和巨大力量。这对于全世界争取民主进步的广大人民将是一个有力的鼓励和精神的指导。
    中国过去不但不曾有过人民民主的宪法，并且如刘少奇委员在关于宪法草案的报告中所指出，除了辛亥革命产生的而随即被袁世凯撕毁了的那个临时约法以外，中国从来也没有产生过资产阶级的民主宪法。像我这样年过六十的人，今日能看见人民的宪法出世，并且作为人民代表参加这个宪法的制定，在个人是特别感觉荣幸的。我表示衷心拥护中央人民政府委员会提交大会的中华人民共和国宪法草案，建议大会全体一致予以通过。
    梅兰芳代表的发言主席、各位代表：
      当我听到毛主席的开幕词和刘少奇委员关于宪法草案的报告的时候，我简直无法形容心中的喜悦和感动。
    难忘的一九四九年，中国人民在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，经过了长期的艰苦奋斗，解放了全中国，伟大的中华人民共和国成立了。从此，我们的祖国得到了独立和民主。在我个人，永远不能忘记自己和全国人民过去的那些苦难的日子；自然也就不能不深刻地体会到新中国的繁荣和富强，体会到作为新中国人民的光荣和幸福。现在，通过我们国家五年来各方面建设的成就，总结各方面的宝贵经验，来制定了社会主义类型的宪法，我们的祖国将在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的领导之下，建设成为一个繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。我对于这一个宪法草案表示完全赞同和拥护，并向敬爱的毛主席致以崇高的敬意。
    宪法草案极其正确地全面地规定了公民的权利和义务。它在第三章第九十五条关于保障和鼓励公民进行科学研究、文学艺术创造和其他文化活动的规定，同其中所有的各项规定一样，不仅是反映了广大人民的共同愿望，而且也是五年来事实的总结。我作为一个文艺工作者，感受特别亲切，受到了极大的教育和鼓舞。
    毛主席对于戏曲改革工作所指示的“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针，使我国戏曲艺术事业有了新的生命，有了正确的方向和光明的前途。党和人民政府对我国传统歌剧艺术的改革和发展，一向是非常重视的。在各级人民政府的具体领导和全国戏曲界同志们共同努力之下，我们的工作已经获得了初步的成绩，舞台上已开始出现了新的面貌。在“百花齐放，推陈出新”的指导方针下，所出现的中国戏曲如此繁荣的景象，是中国有史以来所没有的。
    政府对于戏曲工作者青年一代的培养，给了空前的重视和关怀。目前已经举办了几处戏曲学校，开始培养了一批青年演员，这是值得特别兴奋的。为了戏曲事业将来更好的发展，我建议政府对于培养戏曲工作者的青年一代，还须给以更大的支持。最好能够按照我们主观的力量和客观的需要，最重要的是为了将来的需要，有计划地进行培养工作。经验证明，任何人才的培养，都是需要长期的；而传统歌剧演员的培养以及传统歌剧音乐、导演、编剧、舞台美术各方面人才的培养，也是需要长期的、严格的训练，因而就必须早一点着手。我们戏曲界在解放以前受了反动统治者的各种摧残和压迫，不少的剧种后继乏人的情况是严重的，这应该请政府注意；特别是从全国人民对文化艺术的需要不断增长的情况看来，那么，我们有计划地质量并重地培养后辈人才，就显得异常迫切和重要了。
    其次，我认为在戏曲改革工作中，应该反对粗暴，也应该反对保守，片面地强调都是不对的。对于戏曲遗产和民族艺术传统不尊重的现象，仍然是应该继续防止和反对的。我希望从事戏曲工作的同志，对于祖国丰富的戏曲遗产，应该进行比较深入的和系统的研究工作。同时，对于民族艺术，应该采取发展的态度。任何艺术，没有新的发展，就不可能有新的生命。毫无疑问，无论京剧或各兄弟剧种都是有其长远的现实主义传统的；但是，也不可否认，都还存在着一部分糟粕。因此，我们在原有传统的基础上，进行若干的改革和创造，使我们丰富多彩的民族戏曲，够得上时代的艺术水平，更符合人民的需要，是非常必要的。我相信在人民政府领导之下，戏曲艺术事业随着国家的建设和发展，前途是无限光明的。
    亲爱的代表们！当我想到新中国各方面的建设和发展的时候，我是无限愉快的！这几年来，我觉得越来越年轻了。因为我和每一个文艺工作者一样，在艺术创造上得到了政府莫大的鼓励和帮助。我对于美好的未来是满怀信心的！现在让我高呼：中华人民共和国万岁！毛主席万岁！
    彭泽民代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    中华人民共和国宪法草案，是一个具有伟大历史意义的文献，我们华侨代表热烈拥护这个宪法和刘少奇委员关于宪法草案的报告。
     宪法草案第九十八条规定：“中华人民共和国保护国外华侨的正当的权利和利益。”对于这一规定，在中华人民共和国成立以前向来得不到祖国保护的华侨，是特别感激和兴奋的。
    我们华侨，过去亲身遭受的歧视和压榨是太多了。特别在蒋介石卖国集团统治中国的二十二年当中，华侨所受的侮辱、虐待以至被野蛮迫害的痛苦，真是一言难尽。蒋介石卖国集团，从来不知道什么叫做保护华侨的权利和利益；相反地，只是欺骗华侨，勒索华侨，盗窃华侨的赡家费用，甚至勾结帝国主义来残害华侨。蒋介石卖国集团的祸侨害侨的罪行，真是罄竹难书。现在，就我亲眼所见和记忆所及的几件事说一说。
    蒋贼在霸占中国期间，以剥削、勒索、残害华侨和侨眷为其一贯的政策。华侨一踏入国门，就会遭到蒋贼所指使下的特务的敲诈勒索；稍一违意，即借词陷害，使华侨回国有如进入虎口。这和今天中央人民政府对归国华侨的无微不至的照顾政策，是一个强烈的对照。
    蒋贼一贯利用他的银行发行一日数跌的纸币；同时，硬性规定牌价，任意积压侨汇，使得华侨汇回祖国的养家费到达侨眷手中，已经所值无几，广大侨眷的生活因而陷于绝境。我还记得，在美洲有一位华侨根据蒋匪银行规定的汇兑牌价寄了三百美元回国，经蒋匪银行积压了半年时间，因伪币贬值，侨眷不愿收款，退回美洲，又过了一个时期，结果再由伪币折回美元，已不到三元，弄得他一家无以为生，连父母和子女都饿死了。在蒋介石反动统治期间，像这样的惨事多到举不胜举。
    在抗日战争期间，华侨出于爱国的热忱，捐输不少的抗日救国款项，这些爱国捐献，汇回祖国，都变成了蒋贼的四大家族的私人财产。蒋贼更无厌地巧立名目，有所谓“祝寿献金”等花样，来榨取华侨的血汗钱。抗日战争胜利后，更派遣大批特务、党棍蜂拥到海外，同各地流氓地痞相勾结，组成所谓“肃奸团”，对于侨胞工商界人士，施行恐吓、勒索手段，侨人大受其害，这就是蒋介石对待在抗日时期热爱祖国的华侨的一个毒辣的回礼。流窜国外各地的蒋匪特务，在华侨社会中间，到处制造纷争，破坏华侨团结，甚至勾结帝国主义者诬告陷害侨胞，明目张胆地以武力对付进步华侨。大家还记得，缅甸爱国侨领曾顺续先生就是被蒋贼指使的特务暗杀的。尤其是菲律宾、泰国等地区的华侨，所受的迫害更为厉害。为着时间关系，可惜未能把蒋贼祸侨的罪行，尽量向大会控诉。最近蒋介石卖国集团以美国的军舰、飞机，劫运北越华侨，胁迫他们到台湾充当炮灰；在泰国地区，蒋匪的特务，在美帝国主义特务头子杜诺万指使之下，正在组织所谓“华侨自卫队”，企图驱使我国外华侨去充当以亚洲人杀亚洲人的战争炮灰。蒋贼在美帝国主义的庇护下，窃踞台湾为巢穴。利用美造飞机，对我沿海地区和岛屿滥施轰炸，屠杀人民及华侨眷属。蒋匪这一联串的卖国祸侨罪行，已引起国外华侨和国内人民切齿痛恨。我们华侨一定和祖国人民一道，为解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团而奋斗到底！
    中国人民已经站起来了，只有今天，国外华侨的正当权利和利益才真正得到祖国的保护。华侨深深知道：我们宪法上记载的保护华侨的正当权利和利益的条文，是中国人民革命的胜利成果。我以华侨代表的身份向中国共产党和毛主席表达衷心的感谢，因为只有中国共产党和毛主席的英明的领导，我们才能胜利地走上社会主义的光明大道。
    陈望道代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意中华人民共和国宪法草案和刘少奇委员关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告。
    这个宪法，我们认为有下列几个特点：
    第一，它在中国宪政史上是空前的、新型的，它在同一类型的宪法中也是自有其特色的。中国人民要求立宪行宪已经有五、六十年，五、六十年中也曾出现过各种各样的宪法，其中也有在当时富有进步意义的，如民国元年的临时约法，但它们都是旧型的、非社会主义的，不能满足人民的渴望的。能够满足人民大众的渴望的属于社会主义类型的，只有这一个宪法，过去的任何一种宪法都不能和它相提并论的。同时，它在同一类型的宪法中又是有它自己的特色，凡在同别国情况类似的地方固然有类似的规定，在同别国情况不同的地方也有不同的规定，例如人民检察院。它是中国人民的创作，不是任何现成宪法的摘录。
    第二，它是以一九四九年的中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领为基础，又是共同纲领的发展。发展最明显的一点，是共同纲领没有提到如何建立社会主义社会，宪法草案第四条已经具体规定建立社会主义社会。其他方面也都有所发展。发展不在条文多。如以文化教育的规定为例，共同纲领关于文化教育的规定有四十一到四十九条，宪法草案关于文化教育的规定只有九十四和九十五两条，但宪法对于国家设立并且逐步扩大各种学校和其他文化教育机关，对于保障公民进行科学研究、文学艺术创作和其他文化活动的自由，国家对于从事科学、教育、文学、艺术和其他文化事业的公民的创造性工作给以鼓励的帮助，特别是对于国家关怀青年体力和智力的发展，都有更明确的规定，对于从事文化教育事业的公民的要求也更高。虽然条文比共同纲领少了三分之二以上，实质上是共同纲领的发展。
    第三，它是要求大家努力，要求大家奋勇前进的宪法，不是任令任何人株守现状的宪法。这个宪法不但以立法形式固定了我国人民已经争得的革命成果，也还以立法形式确立了保证我国能够通过和平的道路消灭剥削和贫困，建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会的一个方案。关于经济方面的条目已经列在宪法草案第一章总纲中，需要人民共同努力，奋勇前进。关于文化教育等等一切方面，也都需要同它密切配合，齐头并进。我们知道这个宪法所固定下来的革命成果，是得来极不容易的。为了解放，中国人民经过了一百多年的英勇奋斗，尤其是三十多年来在共产党的领导下经过了异常艰苦的奋斗，我国久经奋斗的人民在建设社会主义社会的大业前面，一定都能奋发有为，加强人民民主统一战线，加强各民族的团结，发展和巩固同苏联和人民民主国家的友谊，也增进同全世界一切爱好和平人民的友谊，以无比的热忱，以一切实际工作来使宪法所规定的建立社会主义社会的条规全部实现。
    各位代表，我相信这个宪法通过必能成为建设社会主义社会的极大动力，建议予以通过。
    巩天民代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    刘少奇委员关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告，我完全同意。
    我以无比兴奋的心情，欢迎中华人民共和国宪法的诞生。我们的宪法是社会主义类型的。它标志着中国人民经过了一百余年的英勇奋斗，特别是近三十多年来，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，获得了人民革命的伟大胜利，指示出我们国家要建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会，我表示忠诚的拥护。
    自从宪法草案公布以后，在全国各地展开讨论，各界人民踊跃参加，并认真地提出修改和补充的意见。同时，由于宪法草案关切到全国人民利益，表达了建设社会主义社会的共同愿望，因此我们的宪法已成为鼓舞人民在生产建设中的巨大力量。工商界资本家们看到宪法草案的序言中：提出要“保证我国能够通过和平的道路消灭剥削和贫困，建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会”。他们体会到国家对私营工商业的政策是和对待封建地主阶级大有区别的。讨论到第十条时，对国家对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的方针、政策就更清楚了。在沈阳市参加宪法草案讨论的工商业资本家们愉快地说：“国家前途是光明的，我们的方向确定了，只要老老实实地接受社会主义改造，我们的前途也是光明的。今后就是得积极生产经营，一切都不成问题了。”因此在私人工商业方面，多数人心安理得地来接受社会主义改造，并要发挥它们的积极作用；但还有一部分人在生产经营上消极观望，甚至有个别的破坏机器的现象。几年来沈阳市工商业在中国共产党和人民政府的正确领导下，和国家加工订货大力扶助下，得到恢复和发展，有好多带有投机性的商业转入工业，私营工业在生产军需民用物品方面也起了相当的作用。政府主管工商业部门在管理指导工作上成绩是肯定的，但也有缺点。主要是认为在沈阳国营经济比重大，可以带动私营工业的生产，因此在可能发生的具体问题上注意不够，配备的管理干部不足，对生产情况和技术设备条件不太熟悉，遇到具体问题处理上就感到困难；对私营工商业政策宣传教育不及时，对管理加工订货成本掌握的不准确，偏高偏低，特别是国营加工单位对私营工厂业务的领导不够具体深入。而我们沈阳市工商联在这些工作上也不够深入，未能把私营工商业的思想情况和产销问题系统地反映给政府有关部门做纳入计划的参考，在某种程度上有报喜不报忧的现象，在这方面我是负有相当责任的。
    我们的宪法草案公布后，指出利用资本主义工商业的积极作用，限制它们的消极作用，这将会促使沈阳市与私营工业有关的部门扶助私营工厂把生产技术提高一步，试制新产品。现在政府有关方面正指导私营机械工业制造新农具要在技术革新、试制新产品、保证质量、降低成本方面求发展，但对中小工业的产销问题，私营商业如何走国家资本主义的道路等问题，还没有深入研究。我们为了迎接宪法的实施，这些工作必须认真地逐步来解决，我希望这些有关资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的具体问题，各有关方面能积极提出解决办法。
    我是人民代表，我有决心在大会后，结合传达大会决议，宣传宪法，实施宪法，在当地中国共产党和人民政府领导下，积极行动起来，通过当地民建会员和工商界中的积极分子，带动广大工商业者以实际行动来拥护第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的决议和拥护宪法的实施，要做到真正爱国守法，积极生产、改善经营，为社会主义工业化发挥应有的作用，为争取解放台湾的胜利和在解放台湾斗争中贡献出自己的力量来，为把祖国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义社会而努力。
    噶喇藏代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我是内蒙古自治区的代表，我同在座的各位代表一样，衷心地拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案。
    在宪法草案各个部分都贯彻着民族平等的精神；对于宗教信仰自由的政策，在宪法草案第八十八条又有了专条规定。这些都使我感到十分亲切和高兴。
    我回想在解放之初，曾听到坏人造谣说：“共产党不让人信教”，“不让当喇嘛”等，我在当时是有些怀疑的，也曾看到有的喇嘛听信了这些坏话，跑到别处去了。
    但是从我几年亲身的体验来看，自内蒙古自治区建立以来，庙宇和喇嘛的财产都受到了保护，喇嘛念经、拜佛、收徒弟等正当的宗教活动，也没有受到任何干涉。这是内蒙古的喇嘛们人人都知道的事情。
    内蒙古地区在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的领导下，不仅宗教信仰的自由受到保护，而且由于实行了民族的区域自治，从此就永远摆脱了被压迫，被奴役的苦海；经济、文化有了很大发展，人口上升，牲畜增加，人民生活一年比一年富裕起来了。我们喇嘛人的生活，也同样地好起来了。比如说：我们甘珠尔庙上有一位喇嘛，他在一九四七年时什么都没有，现在已经有了二十多头牛，生活过得很好了。由于好多庙上都办起了喇嘛学校，现在喇嘛们学蒙文的也日渐增多了。喇嘛医生也受到政府的关怀和教育，同中、西医一道，热心地给人民治病。
    我们喇嘛人不仅相信共产党的宗教政策，而且也了解到：爱护我们祖国、爱护我们内蒙古自治区是和爱护自己宗教信仰自由是一致的。
    内蒙古的喇嘛们过去在热爱祖国、热爱自治区、遵守政府法令、响应政府号召、在反对美帝国主义恶魔、援助朝鲜人民解放斗争上，都同各界人民一样，尽到了自己的力量。
    我能作为一个人民代表，出席这次全国人民代表大会会议，感到非常光荣，这也是我们佛教徒的光荣。我愿在中国共产党和毛主席的宗教政策的光辉普照下，和各族各界善良的人们一道，团结全体喇嘛，在自己全部宗教及社会活动中，坚决贯彻宪法，遵守宪法和法律、法令，以回答人民的委托。
    我谨建议大会通过这个充分表达我们各族各界人民心愿的宪法。
    最后，我对于内蒙古自治区各级人民政府在贯彻信教自由的政策上是满意的。但是在个别地方和个别干部中，在执行宗教政策上尚有不妥之处，如在增畜保畜和学习文化上有些要求过高、过急。对这些缺点，希望政府今后加以注意。
    为各民族的亲密团结而祈祷！
    为祖国的繁荣富强而祈祷！
    为毛主席的万寿无疆而祈祷！
    为和平而祈祷！
    为全体代表祝福！
    马鸿宾代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意并拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案。
    五年来，各少数民族地区的各项事业，有了显著的发展，各民族已经团结成为一个自由平等的大家庭。
    宪法草案序言中规定：“国家在经济建设和文化建设的过程中将照顾各民族的需要，而在社会主义改造问题上将充分注意各民族发展的特点。”这是符合各民族人民的利益的，我认为是非常重要的。
    我们的宪法草案，在全国各地、各民族广大人民中进行了多日的讨论，参加了各个人的意见，又经过宪法起草委员会多次修改才提出来的。我们国家的光明前途和广大人民的美满希望，都完全在宪法草案上载明了。它是最完满的、最幸福的。我相信，这部宪法草案通过后，我们西北少数民族一定拥护，一定遵守。以达到社会主义社会，幸甚！邓芳芝代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我是个烈属。我这回能来北京开全国人民代表大会会议，我很高兴、很光荣。想起解放前我们这些妇女连门都少有出过，我连四十里路也没有走过。还说当代表呵！这都是有了共产党和毛主席，才有了今天。
    抗美援朝的时候，我把我的儿子黄继光送到朝鲜前线，在上甘岭，他打得很勇敢，他光荣地牺牲了，对美国鬼子却给了更大的打击。他是我的亲生的儿子，他是全中国人民的好儿女。全国人民纪念他，我也感到非常的光荣。我一定跟着我儿子的路走，爱护国家，作好工作。
    这回我学习了宪法草案，又听了关于宪法草案的报告，我晓得了这真正是我们自己的宪法，现在是我们人民真正当了家，作了主。只有照着宪法去做，才能走到幸福的社会主义社会，所以我真心真意的拥护这个宪法。回去后，我要把会议的情形向大家传达，宣传动员全乡人民，特别是烈军属都来拥护宪法，遵守宪法；再就是要大家参加互助组，参加生产合作社，好好生产，增产粮食，来支援国家工业建设，支援解放台湾。只有这样，才对得起共产党、对得起毛主席，也才对得起我的儿子黄继光。
    邵力子代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我同各位代表一样，以能参加祖国制定宪法的伟大事业，而感到无上的光荣。从中华人民共和国宪法草案初稿提出起，我参加过不少次的讨论，提供过若干条的意见；在修正稿提交全民讨论的前后，我又曾参加某些工作，注意各方面的意见汇辑；最近，又参加全国人民代表大会浙江省组的讨论，又听到刘少奇委员的报告。我深切体会到，全国人民都称赞这部宪法草案，宪法起草委员会十分重视人民的意见，这一部宪法真正是人民自己的宪法。我相信大会将以全体一致，庄严地通过这一部宪法，全国人民更必万众一心，欣奋地拥护这一部宪法。
    这一部宪法是属于社会主义类型的宪法。全国人民这几年来经过各种社会改革运动，亲见各方面的伟大成就，认识了人民民主制度的优越，了解了过渡时期总任务的重要，在讨论宪法草案的过程中，提出的修改和补充意见一百十几万条，没有一条反对社会主义这一目标。建设社会主义社会确已成为广大人民的共同愿望。这是宪法能够彻底实施的最好保证。但是全国人民在欢欣鼓舞之中，还应戒慎恐惧，加强警惕。没有人提出反对社会主义的意见，并不等于没有人存着反对社会主义的意识。由于极大多数人愿向社会主义迈进，极少数人自然不敢公开反对社会主义，但不能说他们不想在暗地里阻挠破坏。横在我们面前的将有不少困难，要依靠宪法这一有力的武器去克服它。此外，由于我们过去在各方面多是落后，留在我们面前的困难也是不少。例如，土地大，人口多，原是我国足以自豪的，但在落后现象还未消除以前，也因而造成某些困难。
    因为地大，全国气候不齐，每年总要有些地区受到偏灾，今年许多地方同时霪雨连绵，洪水便很扩大，如果不是共产党领导着人民英勇地和洪水搏战，灾祸将不堪设想。五年来，中央人民政府非常重视水利，水利部门的工作也非常努力，这是使人鼓舞的。但今年的水害还是这样大，这由于原来存在的困难太多，一时不容易克服，但是我们必须有决心克服它，必须再加强这方面的工作。斯大林曾说：随着人类知识的发展，人们学会了修筑堤坝和水电站，就能使社会防止从来无法防止的水灾；不但如此，还可以使水力转而为社会造福。我们在这方面应再加上疏浚江河的一项。
    由于人多而呈现的困难，文化教育方面是最显著的，现在只就学龄儿童不能全数入学来说。苏联和新民主主义国家的宪法都明白规定普及初级义务教育，我国宪法没有写入，这表现宪法草案的实事求是、也表现这一问题不能在短时期内解决。宪法规定出人民有受教育的权利，而以国家设立并且逐步扩大各种学校和其他文化教育机关来保证它，这是非常使人鼓舞的。但各种学校的逐步扩大，能否赶得上儿童出生率的逐年增加，还很有问题。我国既然要向社会主义迈进，就必然要使每一学龄儿童都有入学的可能。我希望各级人民政府和各地方农业合作社在这方面多多努力，同时社会上有知识和财力的人也要帮助国家克服这一困难，国家是允许私人在遵守法律规定并接受国家监督下兴办中学小学的。
    人多是喜事，但在困难很多的环境里，似乎也应有些限度。宪法规定母亲和儿童受国家的保护，这也是非常使人鼓舞的。但如果做母亲的总是每年生一个孩子，甚或身体已经很弱，负担已是太重，还无法不生孩子，国家对她们也就很不容易保护，她们自己所受的痛苦更不用说了。列宁曾指出工人阶级与新马尔萨斯主义绝不相容，但他又说：“这丝毫也不妨碍我们要求断然废弃一切惩罚堕胎的法律，或者是传播有关避孕的医学理论等等措施。”在我国，堕胎问题可以撇开不谈，至于有关避孕的医学理论等等措施，确是应当传播的，并且，还应当从实际上指导并供应有关避孕的方法和物品。
    我完全相信过渡时期的总任务越早完成，我们面前所有的困难也可越早克服，所以我们必须共同努力，来加速完成社会主义工业化和社会主义改造。我更相信在毛主席领导起草的宪法光辉照耀下，全国人民加强团结，加强警惕，一致向社会主义的目标前进，任何困难都是可以克服的。
    最后，我要表示，我完全同意刘少奇委员关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告。
    贺龙代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我以无比兴奋的心情来参加第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，来参加制定中华人民共和国宪法。大家知道，人民解放军自建军的那一天起，就为解放全国人民，使之永远摆脱被压迫被奴役的地位，建立美好幸福的社会主义社会而奋斗。为了这个目的，中国人民的优秀儿女，拿起武器，组织起来，进行坚决的革命斗争，二十多年来，走过了艰难的道路，经历了残酷的战争，无数革命先烈为了这一崇高的目的流尽了他们的鲜血。在中国共产党的领导下，全国人民终于取得了伟大的胜利，建立了中华人民共和国。胜利以后，人民解放军一方面警惕地守卫着国防，剿灭土匪，并积极参加国家建设。另一方面又为军队正规化现代化的建设进行了巨大的工作，以便更加加强我们的国防力量。宪法草案公布以后，全军立即进行了热烈的讨论，一致认为这个宪法用法律的形式把长期革命的成果固定下来了，并完全反映了全国人民和人民解放军对于建设社会主义社会的愿望。这就给了全军指战员以莫大的鼓舞，更加提高了保卫祖国和建设社会主义社会的胜利信心。因此，我们对于这次大会即将通过的宪法和刘少奇同志的报告表示衷心的拥护，并保证坚决遵守宪法，按照宪法办事。
    宪法第二十条规定中国人民解放军的任务，是保卫人民革命和国家建设的成果，保卫国家的主权、领土完整和安全。对于这样一个神圣的任务我们一定要坚决完成。对于一切反革命分子的破坏活动，必须坚决镇压；对于帝国主义的任何侵略行为，必须彻底粉碎。全国大陆早已完全解放，但是蒋介石卖国集团还盘踞台湾，继续卖国，进一步投靠美帝国主义，在美国帝国主义的支持下，对我国东南沿海地区经常进行骚扰性和破坏性的战争，并妄想实行反革命复辟，变全中国为美国的殖民地。中央人民政府解放台湾的号召和各民主党派各人民团体为解放台湾联合宣言，得到了中国人民解放军全体指战员的热烈拥护。他们纷纷表示决心，一定要解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，以维护我国领土主权的完整，以保卫亚洲与世界的和平。不达目的，决不休止。
    宪法通过以后，全国人民都应切实遵守。中国人民解放军过去有遵守政府法令的光荣传统，今后也必须成为遵守宪法和法律的模范。但是在胜利以后，军队中某些同志滋长着一种居功骄傲的情绪，和轻视法纪的观念。因此，违反群众利益和违犯法纪的行为就屡有发生。这是不能允许的，这是一种违背中国人民解放军光荣传统的恶劣行为。对于这种现象我们已经采取了有效措施予以制止。今后我们一定要继续加强教育，进一步提高全体军人的政治觉悟，发扬人民解放军的优良作风，使每一个军人都自觉地成为遵守宪法和法律的模范。
    我们完全相信：有了中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，有了全国人民团结一致的努力，有了强大的人民解放军的保卫，我们必能胜利地实现宪法所规定的在我国建成社会主义社会的伟大历史任务。
    许德珩代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我很光荣地出席第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议。这次会议将通过中华人民共和国宪法，这是中华人民共和国开国以来的第一个宪法。我诚恳地、热烈地拥护这个宪法草案，拥护刘少奇委员所作的关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告。
    大家都知道，这个宪法是多少年来我们革命先烈的鲜血凝结成的。由于中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，中国人民推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的罪恶统治，建立了人民民主政权；五年以来，全国人民又在各个战线上取得了辉煌的成就，现在把这些成就与国际的经验和中国革命的经验总结起来，用立法的形式固定下来，成为这个宪法。这个宪法代表了全国人民共同的利益，体现了全国人民共同的愿望，指出了全国人民所要走的道路--建设繁荣幸福的社会主义的道路。可以预料，宪法公布以后，全国广大的人民将发挥更大的积极性和创造性，加速我们国家的社会主义建设过程。
    这个宪法公布以后，在全世界范围内将要发生巨大的影响。六亿以上站起来了的中国人民，在宪法所规定的共同轨道上行动起来，为建设社会主义和保卫世界和平而进行更有力的斗争，对于和平民主阵营，尤其是全亚洲广大人民，将要产生如何巨大的鼓舞力量。但另一方面，我们的敌人--美帝国主义和它所豢养的走狗蒋介石卖国贼，不甘心于失败，正在尽一切力量来破坏我们。为了维护国家的主权和领土的完整，为了保卫亚洲和世界的和平，全国人民就要更加紧密地团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，加倍地提高警惕，为胜利地完成解放台湾，彻底消灭蒋介石卖国集团而奋斗到底。
    这个宪法公布以后，我们国家的革命法制将进一步加强。一切国家机关工作人员和全国人民都应该把宪法的精神和各项规定贯彻到自己的工作中和生活中去，严格地遵守宪法和法律。宪法草案第十八条规定：“一切国家机关工作人员必须效忠人民民主制度，服从宪法和法律，努力为人民服务。”第一百条规定：“中华人民共和国公民必须遵守宪法和法律，遵守劳动纪律，遵守公共秩序，尊重社会公德。”为了检察各级国家行政机关、国家机关工作人员和公民是否遵守法律，宪法草案规定了中华人民共和国各级人民检察院的检察权。这些规定都是正确的和必要的。五年以来，我们国家进行了一系列的民主改革运动，其中包括“三反”、“五反”运动和反对官僚主义、反对强迫命令、反对违法乱纪的斗争，社会风气起了根本的变化。但是，目前在有的国家机关工作人员和人民群众中间，还存在着不遵守法律的现象，违法乱纪的事件还不断地发生，其中有的还很严重，它使人民的事业遭受到损失。这种现象，必须加以纠正。因此，我建议：宪法公布以后在全国范围内加强关于守法的宣传和教育，向一切违法乱纪的行为作坚决的斗争。我们国家机关工作人员更要以身作则，遵守并执行宪法和法律，在全国人民中间逐步树立自觉地遵守宪法和法律的风气，今后不但要做劳动模范，还要做守法模范。其次，我还建议全国人民代表大会即将成立的法案委员会，根据宪法的规定和国家建设的需要，加强各项立法工作，使我们革命的法制，一步步地趋于完备。
    我们在遵照毛主席在这次大会开幕词中的指示：“努力工作，努力学习苏联和各兄弟国家的先进经验，老老实实，勤勤恳恳，互勉互助，力戒任何的虚夸和骄傲，准备在几个五年计划之内，将我们现在这样一个经济上文化上落后的国家，建设成为一个工业化的具有高度现代文化程度的伟大的国家。”
    祝大会成功！祝各位代表身体健康！
    李国伟代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    今天是中华人民共和国在共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，制定第一个社会主义类型的宪法，这是万分值得欢欣鼓舞的！
    现在我谈谈：我对于这个宪法的精神的体会。
    首先，这个宪法是真正民主的宪法。资本主义的宪法，凡选举人与被选举人都受到种族、教育程度、资产（即纳税达若干数额以上）等种种条件的限制。所以有进步思想的人们，认为它的宪法是虚伪的，假民主的；我认为这一批评是恰当的。我们的宪法不是那样，而是凡年满十八岁的公民，不分民族、种族、性别、职业、社会出身、宗教信仰、教育程度、财产状况和居住期限，只要无精神病，不是依照法律被剥夺选举权和被选举权的人，就有选举权和被选举权。所以个个人有自己奋发的机会，只要对于人民和国家有贡献，一贯地做好事，并不中途而废，就有被选为人民代表的可能。又我们的宪法不仅规定了公民的基本权利，还提出了物质的保证，因此，个个人就会向光明正大的方向发展，不屑就唯利是图、腐化堕落的卑鄙方向着想。这是发扬人权，真正民主的宪法，我衷心拥护者此其一。
    我是办工业吃过各种苦头的人，不要谈受尽帝国主义的压迫和官僚资本主义的摧残的极大的苦头了；就是以前买地基造厂的时候，因为封建势力存在，有的坟墓、有的空地，都留在工场之内，空在那里，无法买进厂房不能规划整齐，而在建筑费用上生产费用上都增添了不合理的开支，并且阻碍了发展。又在资金上，因无一定的来源，积累资金方面亦受种种的牵制，如有盈利的时候，股东总想多分一些，所以只可枝枝节节鸡零狗碎的筹划，不能大刀阔斧做一气贯注的建设。今天我们私营工厂走国家资本主义的道路，资金来源有公方的统筹，积累资金亦有一定的规定，要地基，要人才都极便利；所以如我们的宝鸡厂经过公私合营后，不到两年，就扩大一倍以上，利润增加三倍以上。所以今年我们的武汉厂、重庆厂、上海厂、成都厂都陆续的改为公私合营，都在扩建之中；我们十六个厂，已经有十一个厂走入公私合营，现在我们在广州市的福新面粉厂，亦经地方政府批准公私合营，正在办理手续中，昨天我接到上海来信，建成面粉公司的上海厂和成都厂亦在申请公私合营。公私合营企业对发展生产的迅速成就，将有力地加速社会主义工业建设的进度。宪法鼓励资本家走国家资本主义道路，故我衷心爱戴者此其二。
    论到国营重工业的建设：如鞍钢的扩展，铁道的修造，水利的兴建，大家都看到，在短短的三四年中，何等突飞猛进！假使让私人办理，如资本主义国家的以利润观点为办工业的出发点，就要桎梏生产，国家永远不得富强，我拥护这个宪法的此其三。
    再如此次长江洪水为百年以来所未见，武汉市防汛工作凭了共产党和人民政府的领导，全国人民的支援，和工、农、兵、人民群众的忘我劳动，使武汉市没有受到水患，造成了中国人民与洪水斗争的历史奇迹，这是资本主义国家所不能设想的。
    这个宪法是巩固和平的宪法：在序言中说的明明白白，对内要发挥人民民主统一战线的作用，着重于和平的社会主义改造；又要民族团结、友爱、互助。对外要同伟大的苏联，同各人民民主国家建立牢不可破的友谊，再根据平等、互利、互相尊重主权和领土完整的原则同任何国家建立和发展外交关系，为世界和平和人类进步的崇高目的而努力，这种爱好和平的内外政策，必然得到世界爱好和平人民的同情和重视。这次日内瓦会议得到成功，已奠定了东亚和平的基础，美帝国主义已被孤立，这是活生生的事实。在不久的将来，台湾必然得到解放。因此，我们这个宪法，不但会得到全国人民的热烈拥护，而且会使得全世界爱好和平人民无限兴奋和欢欣鼓舞！
    最后，我深深地体会到，我们的国家经历了数千年的艰难困苦，只有在伟大的共产党和毛主席领导下，才能获得真正的解放，才能有这种实事求是光明正大的宪法，我衷心地爱戴，有说不尽的兴奋和愉快！我欢欣鼓舞地将在宪法照耀之下庆得新生！
    吴耀宗代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议就要庄严地通过中国人民自己所制定的宪法，这部宪法，对几千年来饱经痛苦忧患的中国人民来说，是一件惊天动地的大事，我们全国基督徒热烈地拥护这部宪法，完全同意刘少奇委员的报告，并愿意为这部宪法的实施而努力。
    我自己在一个长时期间，曾经是一个“理想”主义的追求者。我相信过反对任何武力的唯爱主义，把它当作解放人类的万灵药；我醉心过以自由、平等、博爱相标榜的西方虚伪的民主，以为这样的民主可以使中国达到独立和富强。但是，冷酷的事实，早就把我的幻想打得粉碎。我们所将通过的宪法，使我们清楚地看见了实现我们和平幸福生活的正确道路。这不是什么人凭空制造出来的“理想”，而是一个必定能够逐步达到的现实，因为我们所走的道路符合历史的发展，符合人民的需要，而宪法所规定的国家机构和公民的权利义务又都充分地表现了民主的精神，这就保证我们必定能够胜利地完成我们建设社会主义社会的伟大历史任务。
    在宪法草案里面公民权利义务的规定中，宗教信仰的自由列为单独的条文，这是我们宗教信徒所特别感到满意的。在解放前后，由于帝国主义的恶毒宣传，有不少的基督徒，对宗教信仰自由问题，心中怀着恐惧：共产党是不信宗教的，在共产党领导下的政府，会不会真正尊重宗教信仰自由呢？共同纲领对宗教信仰自由的规定，基本上消除了这个顾虑。但是，由于基督教过去百余年同帝国主义所发生的关系，宗教政策的贯彻，就基督教来说，不是一件简单的事，也不是一件容易的事。到目前为止，各地的教会还有一些问题，没有获得完满的解决。但是，五年来的事实证明了：政府不但用了很大的力量来贯彻宗教政策，政府对教会的需要和基督教的三自爱国运动，也给了周到的照顾和大力的支持。有一位基督教朋友说：“过去以为宗教信仰自由是过渡的，现在才知道政府是说得到，做得到。”宪法草案对宗教信仰自由的规定，使我们对政府所一贯执行的宗教政策，有了更清楚的认识，也将使帝国主义对新中国宗教的污蔑宣传，完全破产。
    遵守宪法和法律是每一个公民的义务，基督徒自然也不能例外。我们珍贵宗教信仰的自由，我们不应当滥用这个自由来进行任何有害于人民，有利于帝国主义的活动。同时，我们对帝国主义继续利用中国基督教的阴谋，应当保持高度的警惕。
    一个多月以前，我们在首都北京举行了基督教全国会议，这个会议是中国基督教空前的大团结。在会议上，我们号召全国基督徒拥护宪法，积极参加祖国伟大的社会主义建设，积极参加保卫世界和平运动。我们谴责了美帝国主义对中国的侵略，坚决反对美国侵占我国领土台湾，要以实际的行动来响应解放台湾的号召。我们必定以最大的力量来继续进行基督教的三自爱国运动，并把我们的努力作为我们庆祝中华人民共和国第一部宪法诞生的礼物。
