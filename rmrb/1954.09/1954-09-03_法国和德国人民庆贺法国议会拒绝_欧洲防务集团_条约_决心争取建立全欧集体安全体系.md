France
    TASS, Paris: The French people were overjoyed to hear that the National Assembly had rejected the "European Army" treaty. On August 31st, meetings, gatherings, and demonstrations were held everywhere, with participants solemnly pledging to continue opposing the arming of West Germany. According to "l'Humanité," a delegation of workers from the Citroën automobile factory visited the National Assembly on the 31st, paying tribute to the members who voted against the "European Defense Community" treaty and urging them to strengthen their struggle against West German militarization and to strive for a four-power conference to study the establishment of a European collective security system. Employees of the Puteaux Airport in Paris sent a resolution to Prime Minister Mendès France stating: "The employees of Puteaux Airport oppose the arming of Germany in any form, and they will continue to fight for the conclusion of a European collective security treaty." The resolution was signed by representatives of various trade union organizations affiliated with the General Confederation of Labour (CGT), "Workers' Force" (FO), and independent trade unions. Residents of Saint-Ouen, at the call of the local Peace Committee, gathered on the 31st in front of the monument to the victims of the war against Hitler's Germany. While commemorating the victims, they swore not to allow the reconstruction of a new source of war in Europe. Many other cities and residential areas in France held similar demonstrations.

German Democratic Republic
    According to TASS, Berlin, September 1st: The Berlin newspaper "Berliner Morgenpost" published a speech by Johannes Dieckmann, Chairman of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, on the important significance and consequences of the French National Assembly's rejection of the "European Army" treaty. He pointed out that the decision of the French National Assembly reflects the will of the freedom-loving people of Europe and the world.
    He said: Those in France who opposed the "European Defense Community" have achieved a great victory, and they clearly know that the vast majority of the French people are firmly opposed to the "European Defense Community" treaty.
    He said: The Soviet proposal to conclude an all-European treaty guaranteeing collective security in Europe has pointed out a way to replace the "European Defense Community." After the failure of the "European Defense Community" treaty, this proposal has been placed on the agenda of European politics.
    Dieckmann said: The decision of the French National Assembly will prompt the peace-loving and democratic forces in all of Germany to further expand the struggle for a unified and independent Germany.
    According to ADN: 60,000 residents of Karl-Marx-Stadt in the German Democratic Republic held a rally on August 31st to celebrate the French National Assembly's rejection of the "European Defense Community" treaty.
    Werner Nogeck, a member of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, spoke at the rally. He said: The decision of the French National Assembly means that the "European Defense Community" treaty has gone bankrupt, which is a heavy blow to the warmongers in West Germany and the United States.
    The rally sent a letter to the residents of Marseille, France, congratulating them on their great victory in the struggle for peace. The letter read: "Our two countries must never again become battlefields. Our joint struggle is the best guarantee of peace in Europe."
    In addition, about a thousand workers from the Blankenburg-Harz factory sent telegrams to Édouard Herriot, Honorary President of the French National Assembly, and to the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, congratulating the French National Assembly on its rejection of the "European Defense Community" treaty.

West Germany
    TASS, Berlin, September 1st: ADN reported that the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party issued the following statement on the French National Assembly's rejection of the "European Defense Community" treaty:
      "The rejection of the European Defense Community treaty by the French National Assembly signifies a grave failure of the Adenauer government's policies and of American diplomacy in Europe. This failure clearly indicates that Adenauer's policy of attempting to establish a European Defense Community has further isolated West Germany, and therefore West German policy must be changed. The decision taken by the French National Assembly is a result of the French people's firm opposition to the European Defense Community and to German militarism. This decision is a victory for mutual understanding and a policy of peace, and a failure for the policy of strength and war.
      "After the failure of the policy of establishing a European Defense Community, German militarists and their American patrons will do everything possible to achieve West German re-militarization by other means. Therefore, a resolute struggle against militarization must be waged in West Germany, and the highest degree of vigilance must be maintained against all the plans of the warmongers. The German people should strike a fatal blow to German militarism through struggle. West Germany must pursue a policy that should only proceed from the vital interests of the people, and whose aim should be to restore national unity and independence, restore West German sovereignty, and defend peace. Therefore, after the bankruptcy of the European Defense Community treaty, it is necessary to struggle against all attempts to put into effect the general treaties that seek to deprive West Germany of its sovereignty.
    "Now it is clearer than ever: Adenauer's policy has failed. West Germany now needs a government that will pursue a policy of achieving mutual understanding among Germans and is prepared to negotiate with the German Democratic Republic. We welcome the demand of Erich Ollenhauer, Chairman of the German Social Democratic Party, for the resumption of four-power negotiations, which should be based on the Soviet government's proposal for the establishment of a European collective security system in its note. But the Germans themselves must contribute to this. The Bundestag must positively respond to the proposal of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic. The Central Committee of the German Social Democratic Party must do everything possible to promote the start of negotiations with the German Democratic Republic.
    "The upcoming session of the Bundestag should draw conclusions from the failure of Adenauer's policy and accept the proposal of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic. Therefore, everyone must make this demand to the members of the Bundestag in the form of letters, resolutions, declarations by delegations, etc. The policy of mutual understanding will prevail in West Germany."

    法国和德国人民庆贺法国议会拒绝“欧洲防务集团”条约
    决心争取建立全欧集体安全体系
    法国
    塔斯社巴黎讯：法国人民听到国民议会拒绝
  “欧洲军”条约的消息，非常欢欣。八月三十一日这一天，到处都在举行会议、集会和示威游行，参加会议和游行的人们庄严保证继续反对武装西德。据“人道报”报道，雪铁龙汽车工厂工人代表团三十一日访问了国民议会，这个代表团向投票反对“欧洲防务集团”条约的议员们致敬，并敦促他们加强斗争，反对西德军国主义化，争取召开四国代表会议，来研究建立欧洲集体安全体系的问题。巴黎浦塞飞机场的员工送给孟戴斯—弗朗斯总理一件决议书说：“浦塞飞机场的员工反对以任何形式武装德国，他们将继续为争取缔结欧洲集体安全公约而斗争。”签署这个决议书的有加入法国总工会、“工人力量”和独立工会的各工会组织的代表们。圣多昂城市的居民在当地和平委员会的号召下，三十一日在反抗希特勒德国战争中的牺牲者纪念碑前集会。他们在追悼牺牲者的时候，宣誓不允许在欧洲重建新的战争策源地。法国的许多其他城市和居民区也都举行了这一类的示威。
    德意志民主共和国
    据塔斯社柏林一日讯：柏林报纸“晨报”发表了德意志民主共和国人民议院主席约翰尼斯·狄克曼的一篇谈话，谈到法国国民议会拒绝“欧洲军”条约的重要意义和后果。他指出：法国国民议会的决定反映了欧洲和全世界爱好自由的人民的意志。
    他说：法国反对“欧洲防务集团”的人取得了巨大的胜利，他们清楚地知道，绝大多数法国人民是坚决反对“欧洲防务集团”条约的。
    他说：苏联提出的缔结保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约的建议已经指出了一个代替“欧洲防务集团”的办法。在“欧洲防务集团”条约失败以后，这个建议已经被提到欧洲政治的日程上来了。
    狄克曼说：法国国民议会的决定，将促使全德国爱好和平和民主的力量进一步扩大争取一个统一和独立的德国的斗争。
    据德意志通讯社讯：德意志民主共和国卡尔·马克思斯塔特六万居民在八月三十一日举行大会，庆祝法国国民议会拒绝“欧洲防务集团”条约。
    德国统一社会党中央委员会委员韦尔纳·诺格克萨伊斯在大会上讲话。他说：法国国民议会这一决定意味着“欧洲防务集团”条约破产了，这是对西德和美国的战争贩子的一个沉重打击。
    大会致函法国马赛的居民，祝贺他们在为和平的斗争中获得的伟大胜利。信中写道：“我们两国必须不再变成战场。我们的联合斗争是欧洲和平的最好的保证。”
    此外，布兰肯堡·哈扎尔工厂的约一千工人分别致电法国国民议会荣誉议长赫里欧和法国共产党中央委员会，祝贺法国国民议会拒绝“欧洲防务集团”条约。西德
    塔斯社柏林一日讯：德意志通讯社报道，德国共产党中央委员会书记处就法国国民议会拒绝“欧洲防务集团”条约一事发表声明如下：
      “法国国民议会拒绝欧洲防务集团条约意味着阿登纳政府的政策和美国在欧洲的外交的严重失败。这次失败明显地表示了阿登纳力图建立欧洲防务集团的政策使西德更加陷于孤立，因此必须改变西德的政策。法国国民议会采取的决定是法国人民坚决反对欧洲防务集团、反对德国军国主义的结果。这个决定是互相谅解和和平政策的胜利，是实力和战争政策的失败。
      “建立欧洲防务集团的政策遭到这次失败后，德国军国主义者和他们的美国庇护人将会竭尽全力通过其他的办法来实现西德重新军国主义化。因此，必须在西德进行坚决反对军国主义化的斗争，并对战争贩子的一切计划保持最高度的警惕。德国人民应当以斗争来给德国军国主义以致命的打击。西德必须执行这样一种政策：这种政策只应该从人民的切身利益出发，它的目的应当是恢复民族统一和独立，恢复西德主权和保卫和平。因此，欧洲防务集团条约破产后，必须和一切想使剥夺西德主权的一般性条约生效的企图进行斗争。
    “现在比任何时候更加明显：阿登纳政策破产了。现在西德需要这样一个政府，这个政府将执行达成德国人之间互相谅解的政策，并准备和德意志民主共和国进行谈判。我们欢迎德国社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔关于恢复四国谈判的要求，这种谈判的基础应当是苏联政府照会中提出的关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议。但是德国人自己必须对这件事作出贡献。联邦议院必须正面地回答德意志民主共和国人民议院的建议。德国社会民主党中央委员会必须用一切办法促使和德意志民主共和国开始进行谈判。
    “联邦议院即将召开的一次会议应当就阿登纳政策的破产得出结论，并接受德意志民主共和国人民议院的建议。因此，必须要大家来用书信、决议和代表团发表声明等等形式向联邦议院的议员提出这种要求。互相谅解的政策将会在西德取得胜利。”
