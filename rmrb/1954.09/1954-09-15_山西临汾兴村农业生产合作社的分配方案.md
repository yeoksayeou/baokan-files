The Xingcun Agricultural Production Cooperative in Linfen County, Shanxi Province, has achieved bumper harvests every year since its establishment in the spring of 1952. This year in April, the area suffered an unprecedented severe wheat frost. As a result of their efforts to fight the natural disaster, the wheat yield still reached 112 jin per mu, exceeding the wheat yield per mu of mutual aid groups and individual farmers in the village by more than 40%. However, due to insufficient ideological education, although the actual income of the cooperative members increased, they were not clear about the cooperative's assets and always felt that the cooperative's production increased a lot, but their own share was small. People outside the cooperative reflected: The agricultural production cooperative is doing a good job in production, but when it comes to distribution, after all the deductions, the income is still low. Some cadres in the cooperative optimistically said: "We have distributed two or three times, and it is the same every year." They thought there was no problem.

The prefectural committee work group, together with county and district cadres, conducted in-depth investigations and research in the cooperative, specifically analyzed the thoughts of the cooperative members and people outside the cooperative, and discussed it at the cooperative affairs committee meeting. The cooperative director, Zhang Zuodi, said: "Although we have distributed several times, we can never satisfy everyone. This year, let the members fully develop democracy early and formulate a distribution plan so that our cadres can start preparing early." Accountant Zhang Wenyuan said: "Last year, during the distribution, one said that the corn cobs he received were small, and another said that the cotton he received was bad. Many members took sweet potatoes home to pick and choose, and returned the small sweet potatoes to the cooperative, which could not be processed and were fed to the pigs. This year's distribution must be more careful." Some members and non-members reflected: Whether to work hard or not depends on the results of the autumn distribution. If the distribution is not good, even a bumper harvest cooperative will collapse. After everyone's heated discussion, they realized the importance of doing a good job in distribution. After democratic election by the members' meeting, a distribution committee was established. The committee invited representatives from two mutual aid groups to participate, conducted field observations, carefully estimated the yield and the number of workdays needed in the autumn, and also checked each piece of livestock and farm tools to determine the depreciation rate. According to the spirit of the cooperative's charter, referring to last year's distribution experience, they repeatedly discussed the principles of harvest distribution, the accumulation of public reserve funds and public welfare funds, the deduction of various production investments, the calculation of labor work points that should and should not be distributed this year or postponed to next year, and the distribution methods of various harvests and sideline income. After full deliberation and discussion by all members, the distribution committee repeatedly revised it, and finally, it was passed by the general meeting of all members, and a distribution plan that satisfied everyone was formulated.

The main content of the plan is as follows:

(1) Estimated results: The whole cooperative has 24 households, with 639.22 mu of land (including 39.22 mu of irrigated land). This year, the total sown area is 732.28 mu (some land is double-cropped). A total of 403.83 mu of wheat was planted, producing 45,248 jin of wheat; 11.7 mu of barley, producing 2,459.14 jin; 179.45 mu of cotton, estimated to produce 55,405 jin of seed cotton; 20.4 mu of sweet potatoes, estimated to produce 36,720 jin; 37.95 mu of corn, estimated to produce 7,345 jin; 43.41 mu of millet and sorghum, estimated to produce 4,341 jin; in addition, some sorghum, watermelon, vegetables, alfalfa, etc. were planted. All kinds of agricultural products are converted at slightly lower than market prices, totaling more than 200.93 million yuan, exceeding the total value of this year's production plan by 4% and exceeding last year's total production value by 32%. After deducting this year's production funds from the total agricultural income (including fertilizers purchased from cooperative members and fertilizers purchased with loans from the bank, seeds borrowed from cooperative members, forage and feed invested in the cooperative by cooperative members, expenses for purchasing and repairing small farm tools and miscellaneous expenses in the cooperative, depreciation fees for livestock and farm tools in the cooperative, and interest on cooperative members' investments, etc.) totaling 40.64 million yuan, the total value of agricultural net income is 160.866 million yuan. (Editor's note: The expenses for purchasing farm tools and livestock, the depreciation fees for farm tools and livestock should be deducted from the public reserve fund because the purpose of the public reserve fund is to maintain and expand the cooperative's publicly owned fixed means of production.)

Among them, labor is distributed according to 55% of the agricultural net income, totaling more than 92.76 million yuan; the total net income from sideline occupations throughout the year is 10.77 million yuan, of which labor should be distributed 95% of the net income from sideline occupations, totaling more than 10.23 million yuan. The total income that labor should receive from agriculture and sideline occupations is 100.299 million yuan. Based on a total of 6,500 labor work points for the whole year (including 1,970 work points in the autumn), each labor work point is expected to be distributed 15,844 yuan. Land is distributed according to 40% of the agricultural net income, totaling more than 67.46 million yuan. For the cooperative's land with a yield of 615 shi, 1 dou, and 6 sheng, each shi is expected to be distributed 109,669 yuan. Public reserve funds and public welfare funds are accumulated according to 5% of the agricultural net income, totaling more than 8.43 million yuan; plus 5% of the net income from sideline occupations, totaling more than 530,000 yuan, totaling 8.97 million yuan. (Editor's note: Public reserve funds and public welfare funds are best calculated separately because public reserve funds and public welfare funds each have specific uses and cannot be misappropriated; public welfare funds should be much less than public reserve funds. For ease of calculation, public reserve funds and public welfare funds are best deducted from the total income in the same way as production funds, and the remainder is distributed to land and labor in a certain proportion.) According to the calculated budget standard, Guo Yongfu's family of four, with four laborers and 36 mu of land, is expected to receive 11.54 million yuan this year, exceeding the total value of his family's normal income before joining the cooperative by 110%. Zhang Zuotang's family of nine, with five children and only two laborers, and 57.7 mu of land, together with land, labor distribution, and income from returning production investments, can receive a total of 13.44 million yuan, exceeding the total value of his family's normal net income before joining the cooperative by 41%. Zhang Youyi, with an average amount of labor and land, a family of five, two laborers, and 20.8 mu of land, can receive 7.59 million yuan, exceeding the total value of his family's normal income before joining the cooperative by 116%.

(2) Distribution Principles: According to the cooperative's charter, under the principle of mainly distributing according to more work and more gain, and also taking into account land distribution, based on the cooperative's production situation, comprehensively considering, uniformly calculating, and fairly and reasonably distributing, the actual income of each member should be increased compared with before joining the cooperative and compared with last year, or at least not lower than the actual income before joining the cooperative and last year. According to this spirit, it is determined that in agricultural income, labor distribution accounts for 55% of the net income, land distribution accounts for 40%, and public reserve funds and public welfare funds account for 5%; in sideline income, labor distribution accounts for 95% of the net income, and public reserve funds and public welfare funds account for 5%.
(The cooperative's tofu workshop, pig raising, cotton gin, and transportation during slack farming seasons, which serve agricultural production, have their profits deducted from livestock feed, cooperative members' investments, and interest on investments. The remaining net profit is deducted by 5% for public reserve funds and public welfare funds, and the rest is combined with the agricultural labor income portion and uniformly distributed according to agricultural and sideline labor work points.)

(3) Deduction of Various Production Investments: Part of this year's production investment in forage and feed was deducted from last year's total income, and used until the end of the first lunar month of this year; since February, cooperative members have been mobilized to invest in advance. Other seeds, fertilizers, bank loans, the cooperative's addition of small farm tools and repair of larger farm tools, etc., were all deducted from last year's total income until the end of the November harvest last year, and after that, all were invested by cooperative members. Therefore, some members proposed: This year's and next year's forage, feed, and seeds can be deducted from the total income at once until next year's wheat harvest or autumn harvest, saving the trouble of going back and forth, and the remaining investments will still be deducted each year. However, after everyone's research, it was considered that there were three shortcomings in doing so: First, if the cooperative members' distribution figures are necessarily reduced after deducting the amount from February of this year to next year's wheat harvest or autumn, it will cause dissatisfaction among some cooperative members and also cause outsiders to mistakenly think that the cooperative has "a bumper harvest but less distribution"; second, the cooperative will soon be expanded, and after such deduction, the investment accounts between new and old cooperative members will not be easy to settle, and some cooperative members are also worried about suffering losses after absorbing new cooperative members. Therefore, everyone wants to deduct the livestock forage, feed, and various other investments uniformly until the end of the autumn harvest in the eleventh lunar month of this year. In this way, the cooperative cadres are worried about the lack of grass and feed for the livestock after the autumn harvest, and it is also difficult to carry out unified seed selection in the cooperative, especially the selection of plants and flowers in the cotton field. Deputy Director Zhang Wenda said: "It is difficult and troublesome for cooperative members to invest in forage, feed, and seeds after they are distributed." After discussion, it was decided that the cooperative would uniformly retain all the harvested barley, sorghum, and hard millet as livestock feed, the wheat straw, millet straw, and sorghum stalks would be uniformly retained as forage, the sorghum and corn stalks would be uniformly retained for composting and fertilizer production, and the cotton stalks would be distributed to the members in proportion for fuel use, and the seeds would be uniformly selected in the cooperative. The forage, feed, stalks, and seeds uniformly retained by the cooperative will not be deducted by the cooperative for the time being, but will be converted into RMB and distributed to the members in the same way as other crops. However, they will no longer be distributed to the members, but will be recorded in their names according to the proportion of land and labor they receive as their investment in the cooperative, and will be returned after the autumn harvest next year.

(4) Calculation Method of Labor Work Points: Some cooperative members proposed that "regardless of anything else, ten points should be counted as a labor day for distribution." However, after careful discussion and research by everyone, the following different labor work points should be handled separately: (1) Obligatory labor, such as collective delivery of public grain by the cooperative, preferential treatment for military service, etc., should be borne by the labor force on average and should not be calculated as labor distribution. (2) Basic construction labor in the cooperative, except for the labor work points used for general repairs of embankments, etc., which should still be distributed this year, other labor work points such as digging canals, sinking wells, building cattle sheds and horse stables, setting up mill sheds, and planting trees on a large scale involve too much labor, and the income that should be obtained from all the labor cannot be obtained in the same year. If it is distributed in the same way as the labor work points used in production, on the one hand, it will reduce the number of benefits for each labor work point and affect the enthusiasm of cooperative members, and on the other hand, land should also bear part of the labor and material costs of this basic construction related to increasing production, and it is unreasonable to completely include this construction labor in the total number of labor work points for distribution. Everyone believes that the labor work points used for basic construction directly related to increasing production should be borne according to the proportion of land and labor distribution, and the cost of basic construction should be deducted from the total income. If a certain basic construction cannot directly generate profits or generates very little profit in the same year, the total number of labor work points should be deducted among the members according to the number of work points to be borne by the land and labor, and recorded in the names of each member. When the basic construction generates income, it will be distributed year by year. The labor work points for the newly built mill shed in this cooperative were distributed last year, and the fertilizer income from the mill shed every year in the future should be purchased by the cooperative at a discount, and the fertilizer price will be distributed to labor. (3) The labor work points used for work that can only be effective next year should be transferred to next year for distribution. For example, the labor work points used for fertilizer accumulation, fertilization, plowing, wheat planting, winter irrigation, and management in the wheat fields after this year's wheat harvest will all be transferred to next year. The advantage of doing this is that it will not affect the labor enthusiasm of cooperative members due to the direct reduction of the distribution number of each labor work point; it is also convenient to calculate the labor work points of new members who are absorbed into the cooperative after the autumn harvest, and neither the new nor the old members will suffer losses. (4) The work points obtained by the cooperative members from collective composting and fertilizer accumulation should be deducted from the total income to reward the members for actively accumulating and producing fertilizer, and should be completely distributed to labor. (5) The labor work points for drying the various harvests after they are stored in the warehouse and the work spent by the cadres during distribution should be deducted from the total income and completely distributed to labor. (6) Everyone decided to conduct a general evaluation before the distribution and give appropriate rewards to members who have always been active in labor or have made special contributions, and add a certain number of work points, but the highest reward work points should not exceed 3% of the member's total labor work points. Members who violate labor discipline and cause losses to the cooperative's production may be appropriately deducted points, but the maximum deduction should not exceed 2% of the member's total labor work points. For collective waste of labor by the whole cooperative or labor group, the wasted part should be uniformly deducted from the whole cooperative or the whole group. The work points contracted by the three labor groups of the whole cooperative should be reviewed one by one. If the difference is not significant, no changes will be made; if the labor used is more or less, it should be democratically evaluated and increased or decreased according to the actual situation. If the estimated number of work points and the actual need are significantly different, the original contracted number should be revised.

(5) Distribution Method: Several major crops such as cotton, wheat, corn, millet, and sweet potatoes are mainly distributed "according to what is planted." All harvests are converted into RMB for calculation, and the following methods are adopted for distribution:

(A) Everyone agreed to distribute using the method of "matching according to people, distributing as it is harvested." In terms of variety matching, wheat was pre-distributed in the summer harvest according to the proportion of land and labor, and many members had opinions. Members with fewer people and more labor or more labor and more land received more wheat. Although they sold part of the surplus grain, they still have a lot of wheat now. Members with more people and less labor or less labor and more land received less wheat. Although they did not sell surplus grain, they now have very little wheat. After everyone's research, the past distributions will no longer be overturned. In the autumn distribution, cotton will still be distributed according to the proportion of distribution. The four kinds of grains: corn, millet, sorghum, and mung beans, in addition to paying the autumn public grain of each member of the whole cooperative at a discounted price and recorded in the names of each member, the rest will be distributed equally among all the cooperative members at home, separating adults and children, and calculated at market prices according to the proportion of distribution. As for the unified purchase and sale of grain by the state in the autumn, the number of grain to be sold or supplied will be determined separately according to the actual amount of grain received by each member in the summer and autumn and the number of people at home. In addition, the cooperative's sweet potatoes, as the main food for the members, can be averaged more than 400 jin per person, but there are difficulties in storage, and some members are unwilling to take them; some members with larger populations and stronger labor are willing to take more. Therefore, it is determined that the members will report themselves according to their respective family living situations, and the cooperative will make appropriate matching. This distribution is not only suitable for the current living habits of the members of "eating what they plant" and "eating what they harvest," but also facilitates the calculation of the unified purchase and sale of grain by the members to the state. The method of distributing as it is harvested is: cotton is divided into foot flowers once, waist flowers three times, and tip flowers once, for a total of five times; corn is divided into ears on the spot with the skin, weighed and divided; millet, sorghum, and mung beans are weighed on the field and divided after each harvest; sweet potatoes are weighed and divided on the spot; various vegetables are reported by the members according to their needs and weighed. The advantage of distributing as it is harvested is that it can solve the problem of having nowhere to put grain and cotton in the cooperative; it can avoid the waste of time in carrying it back and forth after threshing; it can avoid the loss of grain and cotton and accidents caused by carrying it back and forth after entering the warehouse.

(B) In order to solve the problem of different qualities of distributed cotton and grain, it is decided that: (1) When cotton is picked once, it should be distributed evenly according to good land, bad land, irrigated land, and dry land; (2) Corn and sweet potatoes should be matched in proportion to the size and quality of the piles; (3) The grain threshed on the field should be opened with a combination of good and bad land; (4) After winnowing, the grain from the upwind and downwind ends should be mixed together before being divided.

(C) Because the estimated income figures are not yet very accurate, in order to avoid the trouble of long refunds and short supplements after distribution, everyone determined that various varieties should be distributed at 70% first. After the autumn harvest is completed, the accounts can be settled, and there will only be supplements but no refunds, which is simple and convenient.

(D) Regarding the organizational leadership of the distribution of harvests by agricultural cooperatives: A distribution committee should be democratically elected, with the director and deputy director of the committee being the director and deputy director of the cooperative, and the accountant, custodian, production team leader, etc. being members, with division of labor and responsibility for checking and keeping the remaining grain and cotton, checking the dryness and quality of the grain and cotton, and assisting the work recorders of each labor group in registering the number of grain and cotton harvested and taken away by each group and the members every day. The order in which the members receive grain and cotton should be arranged by the cooperative in advance and notified to the members. The members take two copies of the receipt from the accountant (one copy is kept by the cooperative), and the members take the grain to the field with the receipt. The production team leader or committee member at the field receives the receipt and weighs it. After distribution, the production team leader hands over the remaining grain to the custodian for storage. Finally, the accountant, production team leader, and custodian connect and reconcile the accounts.

(6) After the distribution is completed, the accountant should record the work points transferred to next year for distribution; at the same time, the distribution committee should conduct a distribution summary, conduct education on socialism, collectivism, and labor glory, and pay attention to appropriately resolving the outstanding problems after the distribution.

After the distribution plan was determined, it greatly encouraged the members' production enthusiasm. The members generally reflected: They have a clear understanding of the cooperative's assets, and they should strive to do a good job in autumn production! Female member Du Yaoying had not worked in the fields for half a year. She participated in the discussion on the first day and actively worked in the fields on the second day. Han Mengying said: "In the past, I didn't know that a labor work point could be divided into so many reds. Losing a work point means losing more than a dou of grain. I have to work hard!" Therefore, after discussion, all the members proposed to strengthen field management, harvest cotton diligently and cleanly, harvest grain carefully and meticulously, and further increase the value of products by 10 million yuan on the basis of the planned overproduction. They also decided to press green manure and accumulate fertilizer as early as possible, and organize wheat fields to ensure that winter wheat is planted well, laying a good foundation for next year's bumper harvest.

In the three days after the overproduction plan was drawn up, the three labor groups competed to hoe the miscellaneous grain land again, turned the sweet potato vines once again, cut more than 20 mu of cotton, and turned and pressed 40 mu of green manure, which greatly demonstrated the superiority of the cooperative and drove the mutual aid groups and individual farmers in the whole village to turn the "idle July" into a "busy July."

    山西临汾兴村农业生产合作社的分配方案
    崔西三
    山西省临汾县兴村农业生产合作社自一九五二年春天建立以来，年年丰产。今年四月，该地遭到空前严重的小麦冻灾，他们努力与自然灾害斗争的结果，小麦每亩仍产一百一十二斤，超过全村互助组和个体农民的小麦每亩产量百分之四十以上。可是，因为没有充分地进行思想教育，社员实际收入虽有增加，对社的家当却不摸底，总感到社内增产多，自己分益少。社外群众反映：农业生产合作社生产搞得不错，但到分益时三扣两扣的，还不是一样的收入少。而社内有些干部却盲目乐观地说：“已经分配过两三次了，还不是年年如此。”认为没啥问题。
    地委工作组协同县区干部深入社内调查研究，具体分析了社内社外群众思想，并在社务委员会上作了讨论。社长张作棣说：“虽然也分配过几次了，但总是不能使大家都满意；今年早点让社员充分发扬民主，制定一个分配方案，咱们干部就能早下手准备。”会计张文源说：“去年分配时这个说他分的玉茭穗子小，那个说他分的棉花坏，许多社员把红薯拿回家去挑拣，把小红薯退到社里，没法处理，结果喂了猪。今年分配可得要细致些。”有些社员和没入社的农民反映：干不干，看秋后分配的结果；如果分配不好，丰产社也免不了要垮台。经过大家热烈讨论，认识到做好分配工作的重要意义。经过社员大会民主选举，成立了分配委员会。委员会请了两个互助组的代表参加，进行了田间观察，细致地估计产量和秋季还需用的工数，把社内牲畜、农具也逐件作了检查定出折旧率，根据社章精神，参考去年分配经验，反复讨论了收获物分配原则，公积金和公益金的积累，各种生产投资的扣除，今年应分益和不应分益或移至明年分益的劳动工分的计算，各种收获物和副业收入的分配方法。经过全体社员充分酝酿讨论，分配委员会反复修正，最后经全体社员大会通过，制定出大家满意的分配方案。
    方案的主要内容如下：
    （一）估算结果：全社二十四户，土地六百三十九亩二分二（内有井浇地三十九亩二分二），今年共播种面积七百三十二亩二分八（一部分土地复播）。共种植小麦四百零三亩八分三，产小麦四万五千二百四十八斤；大麦十一亩七分，产二千四百五十九斤十四两；棉花一百七十九亩四分五，估产籽棉五万五千四百零五斤；红薯二十亩四分，估产三万六千七百二十斤；玉米三十七亩九分五，估产七千三百四十五斤；谷子、黍子共四十三亩四分一，估产四千三百四十一斤；此外还种了一些高粱、西瓜、青菜、苜蓿等。各种农产品均以稍低于市价折算，总共折合人民币二亿零九百三十万余元，超过今年生产计划收入总值百分之四，超过去年生产总值百分之三十二。从农业总收入中除去今年的生产资金（包括向社员购买的肥料和从银行贷款买的肥料，向社员借用的籽种、社员投资入社的饲草、饲料，社内购买修补小型农具的费用和杂支，社内牲口、农具的折旧费，社员投资的利息等）四千零六十四万元外，共计农业纯收入总值一亿六千八百六十六万元。（编者按：社内购买农具、牲口的费用和农具，牲口的折旧费，应从公积金中扣除；因为公积金的用处就是保持和扩大全社公有的固定生产资料。）
    其中劳力按农业纯收入的百分之五十五分益，共得人民币九千二百七十六万多元；全年副业纯收入共计一千零七十七万元，其中全年副业纯收入中，劳动力应分百分之九十五，计一千零二十三万多元。劳动力从农业和副业中应得的收益合计一亿零二百九十九万元。以全年共应分益的劳动工六千五百个（包括秋季工一千九百七十个）计：每个劳动工预计分益一万五千八百四十四元。土地按农业纯收入的百分之四十分益，共得六千七百四十六万多元，全社六百一十五石一斗六升产量的土地，每石预计分益十万零九千六百六十九元。公积金和公益金按农业纯收入的百分之五积累，计人民币八百四十三万多元；再加上副业纯收入的百分之五，计五十三万多元，共计八百九十七万元。（编者按：公积金和公益金最好分开来算；因为公积金和公益金各有专门的用处，是不可互相挪用的；公益金应当比公积金少得多。为了便于计算，公积金和公益金最好和生产资金同样从总收入中扣除，余下的按一定的比例归土地和劳动力分配。）根据预算标准计算，劳力多，土地少的郭永福全家四口人，四个劳动力，三十六亩土地，今年估计可分到一千一百五十四万元，超过他入社前的常年收入总值百分之一百一十。劳力少，土地多的张作堂全家九口人，五个小孩，只两个劳动力，五十七亩七分土地，连同土地，劳力分益和归还生产投资等收入合计一起，可收入一千三百四十四万元，超过他入社前常年纯收入总值百分之四十一。劳力、土地都是中等的张友义，全家五口人，两个劳力，二十亩八分土地，可分到七百五十九万元，超过他入社前的常年收入总值百分之一百一十六。
    （二）分配原则：按照社章，在多劳多得为主、并兼顾土地分益的原则下，根据社内生产情况，全盘考虑，统一计算，公平合理地分配，使各个社员的实际收入较入社前、较去年都有所增加，至少也不低于入社前和去年的实际收入。根据这个精神确定了在农业收入中，劳力分益占纯收入的百分之五十五，土地分益占百分之四十，公积金和公益金占百分之五；在副业收入中，劳力分益占纯收入的百分之九十五，公积金和公益金占百分之五。
  （本社所经营的为农业生产服务的豆腐坊、喂猪、轧花车和农闲时的运输等副业，其收益扣除了牲口饲料、社员投资和投资利息，剩余下的纯收益中再扣除百分之五的公积金和公益金，其余都和农业劳动收益部分合并，按农副业劳动工分统一分配。）
    （三）各种生产投资的扣除：今年生产投资中的饲草、饲料，一部分是从去年总收入中扣除的，用到今年农历正月底为止；自二月起，是发动社员投资垫支；其它籽种、肥料和银行贷款、社内添置小型农具与修补较大农具等，全都是由去年总收入中扣除到去年十一月收获结束为止，以后全是由社员投资。因此，有些社员提出：今年和明年的饲草、饲料、籽种，可以从总收入中一下扣除到明年麦收或秋收，省得来回麻烦，其余投资仍各年扣各年的。但经大家研究，认为这样做有三个缺点：第一、如从总收入中统一扣除了自今年二月至明年麦收或秋季，社员分益数字就必然要减少，会引起某些社员的不满，也会引起社外农民对社发生“丰产分益少”的错觉；第二、社不久就要扩大，这样扣除之后，新老社员之间的投资账目也不好清算，有些社员也顾虑吸收新社员后自己吃亏。因此，大家想把牲口饲草、饲料以及其他各种投资统一扣除到今年农历十一月底秋收完毕为止。这样，社内干部又发愁秋收后牲口缺草、缺料，而且社内进行统一选种，特别是棉花田间株选朵选，也感困难。副社长张文达说：“饲草、饲料、籽种社员分了，再发动社员投资，既困难又麻烦。”这问题经大家讨论决定：把社内收获的大麦、高粱、硬黍子全部由社内统一留作牲口饲料，麦秸、谷秸、黍穰等由社内统一留作饲草，高粱、玉米杆子由社内统一留作沤粪制肥，棉花杆子按比例分给社员做燃料之用，籽种由社内统一进行选种。以上由社内统一留下的饲草、饲料、秸杆、籽种，社内先不扣除，折成人民币，和其他作物同样分配给社员，但不再分到社员手中，而根据每个社员土地、劳力分益多少，按比例应留多少，记在他的名下，做为他向社内投资，明年秋后归还。
      （四）劳动工分的计算办法：有的社员提出“不管三七二十一，有十分就应算一个劳动日分益”。但经大家细致地讨论研究，有如下几种不同劳动工分，应分别处理：（1）义务工，如社内集体缴送公粮，优军代耕工等，应按劳动力平均负担，不应计算劳动分益。（2）社内基本建设工，除过一般的修楞补堰等所用的劳动工分仍应归今年分益外，其它如开渠打井、兴修牛棚马房、设置磨棚碾盘、大量植树造林等，用工过多，而当年又不能获得全部劳动所应得的收入，若同生产方面所用劳动工分一样分红，一方面会降低每个劳动工分益数量，影响社员生产积极性；另方面有关兴修水利大量增加产量的土地基本建设，在按土地、劳力比例分益的社，土地亦应负担此项基本建设工料费用的一部分，完全把这项建设劳动工计入劳动工总数内分益不合理。大家认为：直接有关增加生产的基本建设所用劳动工分，应按土地、劳力分益比例负担，基本建设的花费从总收入内扣除。如果某项基本建设当年不能直接获利或获利很少，就按照此项劳动工分总数，在社员之间根据土地、劳力应负担工数扣除出来，记在各个社员名下，等到该项基本建设有收入时再逐年分益。本社新建的磨棚劳动工分已在去年分益，今后每年磨棚里所收入的肥料应由社内折价收买，肥价归劳动分益。（3）对于明年才能得到效果工作所用的劳动工分，应移至明年分益。如今年麦收后在麦田中所进行的积肥、施肥、耕地、种麦、冬浇、管理等所用劳动工分，一律移至明年。这样作的好处是：不因直接减少每个劳动工分的分益数量而影响社员劳动情绪；秋收后再吸收新社员入社的劳动工分也便于计算，新老社员都不吃亏。（4）社员集体沤粪积肥所得的工分，为奖励社员积极积肥制肥，应从总收入中扣除，完全归劳动分益。（5）各种收获物入库以后进行翻晒的劳动工分，和分益时干部所费的工，应在总收入内扣除出来一部分，完全归劳动分益。（6）大家决定在分配前进行一次总评，对于劳动态度一贯积极或有特殊贡献的社员进行适当奖励，加算一定的工分，但奖励工分最高不超过这个社员总劳动工分百分之三。对于不遵守劳动纪律，使社内生产受到损失的社员可适当扣分，但扣分最多不得超过这个社员总劳动工分百分之二。对于全社或劳动小组集体性的浪费工，应从全社或全组内统一扣除其浪费部分。对全社三个劳动组所包的工，应逐件进行审查，如果出入不大就不再变动；如果用工有多有少的，应根据实际情况民主评议予以增减，预计工数和实际需要出入较大的，应修订原包工数。
      （五）分配方法：棉花、麦子、玉米、谷子、红薯等几种主要作物，以“种啥分啥”为主，把所有收获物折合为人民币计算，采用以下办法分配：
      （甲）大家同意用“按人搭配、随收随分”的办法分配。在品种搭配方面，小麦在夏收时是按土地、劳力比例预分的，许多社员有意见。人口少劳力多或劳力强土地多的社员分麦多，虽出售了部分余粮，但现有麦子尚多。而人口多劳力少或劳力弱土地少的社员分麦少，虽未出售余粮，但现有麦子很少。经大家研究，过去已经分配了的不再翻陈账了；秋季分配，棉花仍按分益多少比例分配、玉米、谷子、黍子、绿豆四种粮种，除缴纳全社各个社员秋季公粮折价记入各社员名下以外，其余全部按社员在家人口多少，分别大人小孩，平均搭配，以市价折算，按分益比例分配。至于秋季国家粮食统购统销，按各个社员夏秋两季实收粮数和在家人口，分别计算，确定售粮或供应数目。另外，社内红薯，为社员的主要食品，每人可平均收入四百多斤，但存放有困难，有些社员不愿要；有些人口较多、劳力较强的社员愿意多要。因此，确定根据各自家庭生活情况由社员自报，社内再适当搭配。这样分配，既适合目前社员“吃啥种啥”“收啥吃啥”的生活习惯，又便于社员对国家粮食统购统销的计算。随收随分的办法是：棉花分脚花一次、腰花三次、梢花一次，分五次分完；玉米就地连皮分穗称斤；谷子、黍子、绿豆场间过称，打一场分一场；红薯就地称分；各种蔬菜按社员需要自报过称。随收随分的好处是：可以解决社内粮棉没处放的困难；可避免打场后扛来扛去耽搁工夫；可避免入仓后扛来扛去的粮棉损耗和意外事故发生。
      （乙）为了解决分配棉花、粮食质量好坏不同的问题，决定：（1）棉花要在摘完一遍时按好地、坏地、水地、旱地搭配均匀再分；（2）玉米、红薯按个子大小好坏分堆比例搭配；（3）上场打的粮食，按好地，坏地搭配开；（4）扬场后把上风头和下风头的粮食，掺和以后再分。
      （丙）因现在估算的收入数字还不十分精确，为了避免分配后再长退短补的麻烦，大家确定各种品种先按七成分出，秋收完毕结账，就可以只补不退，手续简便。
      （丁）关于农业社收获物分配的组织领导问题：民主选举成立分配委员会，委员会正副主任由正副社长担任，会计、保管员、生产队长等为委员，分工负责检查保管余存的粮棉，检查粮棉的干湿好坏，协助各劳动小组记工员登记每天各组收打的和社员取走的粮棉数目。社员领粮领棉时，谁先谁后，由社内事先排好，通知社员，社员从会计手里拿上两联条据（社存一联），社员凭条到场取粮。场里由生产组长或委员收条过称，分配后由生产组长把剩余粮食交给保管员入库保存。最后，由会计、生产组长、保管员三人接头对账。
      （六）分配完毕后，由会计将移至明年分配的工分记好账；同时，分配委员会应进行一次分配总结，进行社会主义、集体主义和劳动光荣的教育，并注意适当地解决分配后的遗留问题。
    分配方案确定以后，大大鼓舞了社员生产情绪。社员们普遍反映：摸清了家底，努力搞好秋季生产吧！女社员杜耀英半年来没有上地劳动，第一天参加讨论，第二天就上地积极劳动。韩梦英说：“过去就不知道一个劳动工能分这么多的红，误一个工就丢了一斗多粮食，这可得好好干哩！”因此，全体社员经过讨论，提出要加强田间管理，棉花勤收摘净，粮食细收细打，在预定超额增产的基础上再超额增加价值一千万元的产品。他们还决定及早压青积肥，整理麦田，保证把冬小麦种好，为明年丰产打好基础。
    在订出超额增产计划后的三天中，三个劳动小组争先恐后地把杂粮地又锄了一遍，红薯蔓子又翻了一次，打切棉花二十余亩，还翻压了四十亩绿肥，大大显示出合作社的优越性，并且带动了全村互助组和个体农民，把“闲七月”变成“忙七月”。
