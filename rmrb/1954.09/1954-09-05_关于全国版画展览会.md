    On the National Print Exhibition
    Li Hua
    It has been five years since the art exhibition held during the First National Congress of Workers in Literature and Art in 1949, which showcased woodcut works from across the country; there hasn't been a print exhibition since. We often feel that print creation is really dormant. We know the reasons for this dormancy: it's not that the people don't like prints, but rather that printmakers haven't been well organized to unleash their creative power. In view of this situation, after the All-China Fine Arts Workers Association was reorganized into the Chinese Artists Association in 1953, in accordance with the spirit of the Second National Congress of Workers in Literature and Art, a broad fine arts creation movement was launched, striving for the diverse development of all departments of fine arts, and naturally the development of printmaking was put on the agenda. Therefore, under the Creative Committee of the Chinese Artists Association, a printmaking group was established to lead printmaking creation and to be responsible for organizing printmakers nationwide to create.
    After the printmaking group was established last December, the first step was to understand the situation and form a national printmaking communication network, selecting ten regions including Tianjin, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Wuhan, Changsha, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Xi'an, and Shenyang to establish communication stations, and appointing local printmakers as correspondents. In addition to organizing print creation in their respective regions, these correspondents are responsible for contacting the printmaking group, reporting on creation, exchanging creative experiences, and exchanging works.
    The printmaking group estimates that there are a considerable number of printmakers scattered throughout the country. Although they haven't been carving frequently in recent years, the vast majority have not left their artistic posts, and in any case, it is highly likely that most printmakers will pick up their knives again. To restore their creative enthusiasm, we must first create an atmosphere of print creation. Therefore, we decided to hold regular seminars combined with work viewings. In Beijing, such seminars have been held once a month. In the seminars, in addition to viewing works and exchanging opinions, thematic discussions were also held: such as the issue of themes and expression forms in printmaking, the issue of image depiction in printmaking, the issue of diversity in printmaking expression, and the study of foreign woodcuts. Because the discussions were combined with work viewings, some practical creative problems could be solved. We also organized some printmakers with achievements to talk about their creative experiences for everyone's reference. Everyone's creative enthusiasm gradually increased. The printmaking communication stations in various regions of the country, except for a few where printmakers were too scattered to concentrate meetings, were similar to the situation in Beijing. The holding of printmaking seminars generally achieved the effect of encouraging creation.
    In order to learn well from excellent print works at home and abroad, it is necessary to hold small-scale viewing exhibitions. In the past six months, the printmaking group in Beijing has held domestic viewing exhibitions of ancient Chinese woodcuts, Soviet prints, Czechoslovak and other countries' prints, and Japanese woodcuts, and also moved the Soviet prints to Hangzhou, Shanghai, and Nanjing for mobile viewing exhibitions.
    From last December to this April, printmakers all over the country have been almost universally mobilized. On this basis, we decided to hold a national print exhibition. We did this in order to turn this exhibition into a goal for everyone to strive for, and to further encourage creation with practical actions. After the call was issued, it immediately received enthusiastic responses from printmakers across the country. After nearly two months of preparation, by the beginning of August, the works sent from all over the country had exceeded our estimates, reaching 300 pieces, and most of them were newly created, which shows that the potential of print creation is really not small. Once launched, it can indeed overcome the poor harvest phenomenon of the past few years in half a year. What is exciting is not only the considerable quantity, but also the obvious improvement in quality. From the 200 works selected, we can see these characteristics:
    The growth of new forces in printmaking is a noteworthy fact. We have discovered that the authors of many excellent works have unfamiliar names; some are students who have just left art academies, some are middle school art teachers and cadres, and some are workers and soldiers. These young printmakers are all engaged in print creation with great enthusiasm. With each other's help, they quickly improved their skills to a certain level. Most valuable is that they all have relatively diverse life experiences, so they can create some works that reflect real life.
    Because printmakers have mastered the correct creative methods, drawing themes from life, and focusing on showing the various aspects of the motherland under construction, the content of this exhibition is quite broad. From the great construction of the country's transition period, the lives of the general people (including ethnic minorities), the beautiful mountains and rivers of the motherland, to the beautiful flowers and plants, all are expressed, eliminating the phenomenon of excessively narrow print themes in the past.
    Corresponding to the wide range of themes, we see diverse forms. This is a prominent feature of current Chinese printmaking, especially woodcut art. Another noteworthy fact is that color woodcuts account for half of the works in this exhibition, which not only shows that printmakers are no longer satisfied with the past level, and are demanding improvement in all aspects, but also shows that printmakers have paid attention to promoting the tradition of Chinese folk color woodcut New Year pictures, so that today's prints can better serve the people.
    The appearance of copperplate prints and lithographs is also one of the characteristics of this exhibition. In our country, these two types of prints are much younger than woodcuts, and their appearance can be said to have developed Chinese printmaking to a more comprehensive stage. In order to welcome the cultural upsurge of the motherland, we are preparing appropriate conditions for original prints, book illustrations and posters.
    However, in order to demand further improvement in printmaking, we must examine the existing problems. We see many works that reflect life, but few that truly and typically reflect the contradictions and struggles in life. Some pictures still stay at the level of expressing the phenomena of life. We see some large scenes of factories and machines in the works, and also see livestock and new agricultural tools in the countryside, but we cannot see the ideological and emotional activities of the masters of the machines and agricultural tools. Mere records of life phenomena do not meet the requirements of socialist realism. Our prints must grasp the essence of life and express its contradictions and struggles in order to powerfully educate the people. As for the typicality and diversity of characters, as well as the depiction of the relationships and physical expressions between characters, there is still much to be done, and there are still many stiff characters appearing in the pictures.
    In terms of printing technology, we feel that some printmakers have not given due attention. The authors do not clearly understand that printmaking is a painting that must be completed through printing, so they only concentrate their efforts on carving and drawing, and finally print it out sloppily. As a result, due to the poor ink color, paper quality, and printing technology, the creation of this print is greatly diminished. The lack of knife technique changes is also a common phenomenon; the generally poor level of portrait prints should also be pointed out here.
    This national print exhibition is a review of Chinese printmaking in the past three years. It brings great hope, enabling us to see from the existing achievements and various development conditions that today's print art already has sufficient strength to break through the past level and embark on a broader path of development.

### 关于全国版画展览会

    关于全国版画展览会
    李桦
    自从一九四九年中华全国文学艺术工作者代表大会时举行的美术展览会中展出了全国的木刻作品以来，已经五年了，一直没有出现过一次版画展览会。我们常常感到版画的创作实在是沉寂了。沉寂的原因，我们知道：不是人民不喜爱版画，只是由于版画家没有很好地组织起来，发挥创作力量。鉴于这种情况的存在，一九五三年中华全国美术工作者协会改组为中国美术家协会之后，根据中国文学艺术工作者第二次代表大会的决议的精神，广泛展开了美术创作运动，争取美术各部门的多样发展，自然版画的发展也被提到议事日程上来了。因此，在中国美术家协会的创作委员会之下，成立了一个领导版画创作的机构——版画组，负责组织全国版画家进行创作。
    版画组自去年十二月成立后，第一步工作是了解情况，组成了一个全国版画通讯网，选定天津、上海、杭州、南京、武汉、长沙、广州、重庆、西安、沈阳等十个地区设立通讯站，选聘当地版画家为通讯员。这些通讯员除了组织该地区的版画创作外，并负责和版画组联系、汇报创作情况、交流创作经验及交换作品。
    版画组估计散布在全国各地的版画家是为数不少的。他们近年来虽然不常刻画，但是绝大多数还没有离开美术岗位，不论在哪种情形下，一般版画家重拿刻刀的可能性是很大的。要恢复他们的创作热情，必须先造成一种版画创作的气氛。因此，我们决定经常举办与作品观摩相结合的座谈会。在北京，这样的座谈会保持了每月一次。在座谈会中，除了观摩作品、互提意见外，还进行了专题讨论：如版画的题材与表现形式问题，版画的形象刻划问题，版画表现的多样性问题，国外木刻研究等。由于讨论时与作品观摩相结合，便能解决一些创作上的实际问题。我们又组织了些有成绩的版画家谈谈创作经验，提供大家参考。大家的创作情绪便逐渐高涨了。全国各地区的版画通讯站，除了少数因版画家太分散、无法集中开会外，都和北京的情况相似，由于版画座谈会的举行，普遍收到了鼓励创作的效果。
    为了很好地向古今中外优秀的版画作品学习，小型观摩展览的举行是必要的。半年来，版画组在北京举行过中国古代木刻、苏联版画、捷克斯洛伐克和其他国家的版画、以及日本木刻等对内观摩展览，更将苏联版画移去杭州、上海、南京三个地区作流动观摩展览。
    从去年十二月到今年四月间，全国版画家差不多已经普遍动员起来，在这基础上，我们决定举办
  一次全国版画展览会。我们这样做，为的是想把这个展览会变成大家努力的目标，进一步以实际行动来鼓励创作。这个号召发出后，马上获得全国各地版画家们的热烈响应。经过最近两个月的筹备，到八月初，从全国寄来的作品，已经超出了我们的估计，达到三百幅了，而且大部分是新创作，这说明了版画创作的潜在力量实在不小，一经发动，果然能在半年间克服了几年来歉收的现象。使人兴奋的还不仅在于数量的相当可观，而且质量也显然是提高了。从选出的二百幅作品中，我们可以看到这些特点：
    版画新的力量的生长是很值得注意的事实。我们发现了许多优秀作品的作者，名字是陌生的，他们有些是刚离开美术学院的学生，有些是中学的美术教员和机关干部，更有些是工人和战士。这些青年版画家都是以高度热情来从事版画的创作，他们在互相帮助之下，很快的把技术提高到一定水平了。最可贵的是他们都有比较多方面的生活经验，所以能创作出一些反映真实生活的作品来。
    由于版画家掌握了正确的创作方法，从生活中吸取主题，集中表现了在建设中的祖国各方面的面貌，因此这次展览会的作品，内容是相当广泛的。从国家过渡时期的伟大建设，一般人民（包括少数民族）的生活、祖国的锦绣河山以至美丽的花草，都表现到了，消除了过去版画题材过于偏狭的现象。
    与广泛的题材相适应，我们看到了多样的形式。这是现在的中国版画，尤其是木刻艺术方面的一个显著特点。另一值得注意的事实是这次作品中，套色木刻竟占半数，这不仅说明了版画家已不满于过去的水平，正要求着向各方面提高，也说明了版画家已注意到要发扬我国民间彩色木刻年画的传统，使今天的版画能更好地为人民服务。
    至于铜版画和石版画的出现，也是这次展览会的特色之一。在我国，这两种版画比木刻年青得多，而由于它们的出现，可以说中国的版画已发展至更全面的阶段了。为了迎接祖国的文化高潮，我们正为独幅版画、书籍插画和招贴画准备好适当的条件了。
    但是，我们为要求版画进一步的提高，就不能不检查一下存在着的问题。我们看到许多反映生活的作品，但能真实地典型地反映了生活中的矛盾与斗争的还是不多，一些画面仍停留在表现生活的现象。我们在作品上看到一些工厂的大场面和机器，也看到农村的牲口和新式农具，但看不出作为机器和农具的主人的思想感情的活动。仅是生活现象的纪录，是不符合社会主义现实主义的要求的，我们的版画必须抓紧生活的本质，表现它的矛盾与斗争，才可以有力地教育人民。至于人物的典型性和多样性，以至人物间彼此的关系和体态表情的刻划，也还有许多做得不够，呆板的人物仍有不少出现在画面上。
    在印刷技术上，我们觉得有些版画家没有给予应有的注意。作者不明确版画是一种要经过印刷才能完成的绘画，因此只集中力量在刻和画，而最后潦草的印出来，结果由于墨色、纸质和印刷技术的恶劣，这张版画的创作就大为逊色。至于刀法变化的贫乏也是普遍存在的现象；肖像版画的一般水平较差，也应在这里指出。
    这次全国版画展览会是最近三年来中国版画的检阅，它带来了很大的希望，使我们从既有的成绩和种种发展条件中，看出了今天的版画艺术已经有充分的力量突破过去的水平，而踏上更广大的发展道路了。
