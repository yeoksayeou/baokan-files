Farmers in the suburbs of Beijing are actively increasing the planting of quick-maturing vegetables to supply the needs of the people in the capital. Since the beginning of summer, continuous heavy rains have greatly affected vegetable growth, and some vegetable fields have been flooded, which has affected the supply of vegetables needed in the capital. In order to quickly improve this situation, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Agricultural and Forestry Bureau held a joint meeting of agricultural and forestry section chiefs in the suburbs, proposing a plan to increase the planting of 3,400 mu of quick-maturing vegetables. At present, various suburban districts are actively leading vegetable farmers to rush to plant and increase the planting of quick-maturing vegetables. The Baipen Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fengtai District has already rushed to plant more than 200 mu of quick-maturing vegetables, and Taipingqiao and Sanluju townships have also rushed to plant more than 200 mu. To date, Fengtai District has rushed to plant 1,500 mu of quick-maturing vegetables. Haidian District also plans to increase the planting of 1,000 mu of quick-maturing vegetables. The Dongjiao and Nanyuan districts have held district and township cadre meetings to implement this plan to increase the planting of quick-maturing vegetables, and vegetable farmers are now actively rushing to plant, striving to over fulfill the plan.

    北京市郊区农民积极抢种快熟蔬菜
    北京市郊区农民积极增播快熟蔬菜，以供应首都人民的需要。入夏以来，连降暴雨，蔬菜生长受到很大影响，加以部分菜田遭水淹，因此影响了首都蔬菜需要的供应。为了迅速改善这种情况，北京市人民政府农林局召开了郊区农林科长联席会，提出增播快熟蔬菜三千四百亩的计划。目前，各郊区正积极领导菜农抢种和增播快熟蔬菜，丰台区白盆乡农业生产合作社已抢种快熟蔬菜二百多亩，太平桥和三路居两乡也抢种了二百多亩。到目前止，丰台区已抢种了一千五百亩快熟蔬菜。海淀区也计划增种一千亩快熟蔬菜，东郊和南苑两区已召开了区、乡干部会议，贯彻了这一增播快熟蔬菜的计划，菜农们现正积极抢种，争取超额完成计划。
