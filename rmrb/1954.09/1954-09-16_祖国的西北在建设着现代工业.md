The Northwest of the Motherland is Building Modern Industry
Xiao Tao

The Northwest Plateau, accounting for about one-third of the motherland's total area, is a land with very abundant resources. Before liberation, due to the economic plunder by imperialism and the cruel oppression of feudal forces and bureaucratic capital, the rich Northwest was reduced to desolation, with blocked transportation, backward economy, and people living in dire straits.

Before liberation, most of the cotton produced in the Northwest region had to be transported long distances for sale, and then the cloth needed by the local people was transported back from other places. The Yumen Oilfield had extremely abundant oil reserves, but it was not developed until the early years of the Anti-Japanese War. However, because the refining capacity was smaller than the oil extraction capacity, much of the crude oil was poured into river dams and washed away by water. Except for the Tongchuan Coal Mine, which had some mechanical equipment, the coal mining industry mostly relied on manual extraction, with a total annual output of only about one million tons, which could not meet the needs of local production and living. Industrial coal and most of the civilian coal had to be transported from distant areas. Although there were power plants in larger cities such as Xi'an and Lanzhou before liberation, the equipment was outdated and the scale was small, only able to supply some lighting and unable to meet the needs of industrial development. There was only one machine manufacturing factory that could be called a factory, but the equipment was simple, and it could only repair machines or manufacture some machine parts, and could not manufacture complete machines at all. In the Northwest, with more than 3.3 million square kilometers of land, there were only more than 500 kilometers of railways, and the section from Baoji to Tianshui was often collapsed, and it could only be open to traffic for three months of the year. Although there were more than 20,000 kilometers of highways, only 4,200 kilometers were actually passable by cars.

Due to the undeveloped industry and inconvenient transportation, the agricultural and pastoral production in the Northwest region was also extremely backward. Before liberation, some areas could not even use iron tools and only used wooden farm tools for production. Therefore, the lives of the vast number of farmers and herdsmen were extremely painful.

On the eve of liberation, the Kuomintang bandit gangs carried out serious destruction of the very weak industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises in the Northwest.

Since the day of liberation, the vast number of workers and staff in the Northwest region, according to the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, immediately engaged in the work of restoring production. By the end of 1950, the major industrial products in the Northwest region, except for coal, electricity, and cotton cloth, had all exceeded the pre-liberation levels. By 1952, the output of various industrial products had reached two to five times that of 1948. Moreover, a number of new oil wells, automated power plants, large-scale cotton textile mills, steel mills, automobile repair and assembly plants, cement plants, and high-voltage power transmission networks have also appeared in the Northwest region.

During the period of national economic recovery in our country, the transportation industry in the Northwest of the motherland also made considerable progress. Seventy percent of the Baoji-Tianshui Railway has been completely renovated, and trains can now run smoothly throughout the year. The Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway was also opened to traffic in 1952, making it possible to transport building materials and machinery and equipment smoothly to Lanzhou. In three years, the mileage of highways open to traffic exceeded three times that before liberation.

Since 1953, our country has entered the period of the first five-year plan for construction. Under the unified plan of the state, the Northwest region is also embarking on large-scale industrial and transportation construction. The state's investment in industrial construction in the Northwest region in 1953 and 1954 exceeded 249 percent of the total investment in the past three years.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China five years ago, the huge investment made by the state in the Northwest region has resulted in the completion and operation of a number of factories. However, the focus of work during this period is still to prepare for future large-scale construction, which is first reflected in the largest proportion of investment in geological surveys and exploration projects. In the past five years, various geological surveys and explorations have been carried out in an area of more than 250,000 square kilometers in the five provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang, and more than 255,000 meters of exploratory wells have been drilled. Not only has the reserves of oil and coal been preliminarily explored, but also non-ferrous metal mines with extremely exploitable value have been discovered. Now, many new mines and power stations with huge power generation capacity are being built on this basis. It is estimated that by the end of the first five-year plan, the output of oil and coal will be more than double that of 1952.

In terms of railway construction, new railway trunk lines are under construction: the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, running from east to west, is constantly extending westward. At present, the western end has passed the Wushaoling Mountains. By now, the construction of new lines in the Northwest has exceeded more than double the lines before liberation. The Baoji-Chengdu Railway, running from north to south, has crossed the Weihe River and is advancing towards the Qinling Mountains. The preliminary survey work of the Lanzhou-Yinchuan section of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway has been completed.

In the five years since liberation, while concentrating efforts on developing heavy industry, the newly built textile mills in the Guanzhong area of the Northwest have added more than 200,000 spindles and more than 4,000 looms. The Northwest State-owned No. 4 Cotton Textile Mill, which has 100,000 spindles and more than 3,000 looms, has now begun construction and is expected to be put into operation in 1956. In order to develop animal husbandry in the Northwest and reduce the transportation costs of wool containing impurities, a wool textile mill was built in Lanzhou, and a wool washing factory was built in Xining.

With the development of industry, the face of the Northwest cities is also changing. For example, the population of Xi'an City before liberation was 500,000, and the city's population increased to more than 700,000 in 1953. In the past five years, a total of 35.9 kilometers of new and renovated roads have been built, with an area of more than 381,000 square meters. A new water plant was built in 1952, and two new water plants are currently under construction. The newly built workers' dormitories cover an area of more than 136,800 square meters. There are currently more than 260 schools in the city, and the number of students has more than doubled compared with before liberation. There are currently more than 70 medical institutions such as hospitals and sanatoriums in the city, including more than 50 employee medical institutions. There are currently 25 cinemas, theaters (venues).

Due to the development of industrial production and the convenience of transportation, the ratio of agricultural products to industrial products has gradually become reasonable. The production of agriculture, animal husbandry, and sideline industries in the Northwest region has greatly developed. The production of agriculture (animal husbandry) and sideline industries in 1953 increased by 28.43 percent compared with 1951. The sales of various industrial raw materials such as wool, cashmere, camel hair, cattle and sheep oil, paint, hemp, almonds, and flaxseed are very strong. Therefore, the income of farmers has increased, and their purchasing power has increased.

In the past few years, the lives of workers have also improved with the development of production and the increase in labor productivity. In 1952 and 1953, the staff and workers of state-owned, local state-owned, and public-private joint industrial enterprises, in addition to completing the state's production plans, also increased production and saved 900 billion yuan of wealth for the state.

The task that the state's first five-year plan requires the people of the Northwest to perform is a major one. There are also many difficulties. However, with the correct leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, with the support of all parts of the country, and with the selfless assistance of Soviet experts, the people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest are full of confidence in contributing their strength to realize the state's general task during the transition period and to the country's socialist industrialization. By the time the first five-year plan is completed in 1957, the backward economic face of the Northwest of the motherland will have undergone greater changes, and the lives of the people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest will also be improved more, just like the lives of the people of the whole country.

    祖国的西北在建设着现代工业
    萧陶
    约占祖国总面积三分之一的西北高原，是一块资源非常丰富的土地。在解放前，由于帝国主义的经济掠夺、封建势力和官僚资本的残酷压榨，致使富饶的西北陷于满目荒凉，交通阻塞，经济落后，民不聊生的境地。
    解放前，西北地区所产棉花，大部分需远途运销外地，然后由外地运回当地人民所需要的布疋来。玉门油田的储油量极丰，直至抗战初年才予开发；但因炼油能力小于采油能力，许多原油便被倾入河坝内让水冲走。煤矿工业除铜川煤矿有部分机械设备外，其余多为手工开采，总产量每年不过百万吨，不能满足当地生产和生活的需要，工业用煤及大部民用煤均须靠外区远地运来。在西安、兰州等较大城市，解放前虽曾也有电力厂，但设备陈旧，规模狭小，只能供应部分照明，不能供应发展工业的需要。堪称工厂规模的机器制造厂只有一处，但设备简陋，只能做些修理机器或制造部分机器零件，根本不能制造成台机器。在西北三百三十多万平方公里的土地上，仅有五百多公里铁路，其中从宝鸡至天水段还经常塌方，一年中实际只能通车三个月。虽有二万多公里的公路，但实际能通行汽车的不过四千二百公里。
    由于工业不发达，交通不便，西北地区的农业和牧业生产也极为落后，解放前有些地区甚至用不上铁器，而只用木制农具进行生产。因此，广大农、牧民的生活极为痛苦。
    解放前夕，国民党匪帮对于西北的一点很微弱的工矿交通企业，又进行了严重的破坏。
    自解放那天起，西北地区的广大职工根据中国共产党中央和毛主席的指示，立即从事于恢复生产的工作。到一九五○年底，西北地区各种主要工业产品，除煤炭、电力和棉布外，其余都已超过了解放前水平。到一九五二年，各种工业产品的产量，均已达到一九四八年的二倍到五倍。而且西北地区还出现了若干新油井、自动化的发电厂、大型的棉纺织厂、炼钢厂、汽车修配厂、水泥厂和高压输电网等。
    在我国国民经济恢复时期，祖国西北的交通运输业也有了长足的发展。宝（鸡）天（水）铁路百分之七十已经过彻底改修，火车已能终年畅通。一九五二年又修通了天兰铁路，使建筑材料和机器设备可畅运兰州，三年中所有公路的通车里程超过解放前三倍。
    自一九五三年开始，我们国家进入了第一个五年计划建设时期，在国家统一的计划下，西北地区也在着手进行大规模的工业和交通建设，国家在西北地区的工业建设投资一九五三和一九五四两年即超过过去三年投资总数的百分之二百四十九。
    中华人民共和国成立五年以来，国家在西北地区的巨大投资，虽已有若干工厂建成，并已开工生产。但这个时期工作重点仍是为着将来更大规模的建设进行准备，这首先表现在投资的最大比重是地质调查和探勘工程。五年来，在陕西、甘肃、宁夏、青海、新疆五省二十五万余平方公里的区域内，进行了各种地质调查和勘探工作，仅探井就打了二十五万五千多公尺。不仅初步地探明了石油、煤等的储量，还发现极有开采价值的有色金属矿。现在许多新的矿井和发电容量巨大的电站，正在这个基础上建设着。预计到第一个五年计划结束时，石油和煤的产量都将比一九五二年的产量增加二倍以上。
    铁路建设方面，新的铁路干线正在修建中：由东向西的兰（州）新（疆）路正在不断西延，目前西端已通过乌鞘岭，至此西北新线建设已超过解放前线路的一倍以上。由北向南的宝（鸡）成（都）铁路已越过渭河向秦岭挺进中。包（头）兰（州）铁路的兰州、银川段已完成初步勘测工作。
    解放五年来，在集中力量发展重工业的同时，西北关中地区新建的纺织厂已增添了纱锭二十多万枚，布机四千多台。而拥有十万纱锭，三千多台布机的西北国营第四棉纺厂，现已开始建筑，预计于一九五六年即可开工生产。为了发展西北的畜牧业及减少羊毛含杂的运输费，在兰州建设了毛纺织厂，在西宁建设了洗毛工厂。
    随着工业的发展，西北城市的面貌也正在改变中。例如：西安市解放前全市人口为五十万，一九五三年全市人口已增至七十多万。五年来新修和翻修的公路共有三十五点九公里，面积达三十八万一千多平方公尺。一九五二年新建了自来水厂，目前还有两座新的自来水厂正在建设中。新建的工人宿舍达十三万六千八百多平方公尺。全市现有学校二百六十多处，学生人数比解放前增加了一倍多。全市现有医院、疗养院等医疗机构共七十余处，其中职工医疗机构就有五十多处。现有电影院、剧院（场）二十五处。
    由于工业生产的发展，交通运输的便利，农产品与工业品的比价逐渐合理；西北地区农牧业的生产大大发展了，一九五三年的农（牧）副业的生产比一九五一年增加了百分之二十八点四三，各种工业原料，如羊毛、羊绒、驼毛、牛羊油、漆、大麻、杏仁、胡麻子等的销路都很旺盛。因此农民的收入增加了，购买力提高了。
    几年来工人的生活，也随着生产的发展和劳动生产率的提高而有所改善。一九五二年和一九五三年两年内，国营、地方国营、公私合营工业中的职工，除完成国家的生产计划外，并为国家增产节约了九千亿元的财富。
    国家第一个五年建设计划需要西北人民执行的任务是重大的。困难也是不少的。但有着中国共产党中央和毛主席的正确领导，有着全国各地的支援，有着苏联专家的无私帮助，西北各族人民正满怀信心地为实现国家在过渡时期的总任务，为国家的社会主义工业化贡献出自己的力量。到一九五七年第一个五年计划完成时，祖国西北落后的经济面貌就会有更大的改变，西北各族人民的生活也将和全国人民的生活一样得到更多的改善了。
