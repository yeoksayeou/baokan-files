    Workers and Peasants Across the Country Strive to Increase Production to Welcome the National People's Congress Meeting
   [Our Newspaper News] Workers and peasants in various regions are using practical actions of increasing production to welcome the convocation of the first session of the First National People's Congress.
    Workers at the state-owned Shanghai Electric Motor Factory are working hard to complete the trial production of the first 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator in New China ahead of schedule to greet the National People's Congress meeting. By September 1, with the enthusiastic help of experts from Czechoslovakia, the processing of all parts of this generator was nearing completion. The "stator," one of its main components, has been sent to the drying room for drying after processing. On September 2, the final processing procedures for another main component, the "rotor," were completed. The assembly and test workers are working hard to prepare for the final assembly and testing. The workers have shown a high degree of labor enthusiasm, which will enable the steam turbine generator to be completed ahead of schedule.
    The Ma Liu-Hai and Lian Wan-Lu fast tunneling team of the Datong Coal Mine presented the achievement of completing the August state plan three days ahead of schedule as a gift to the upcoming National People's Congress. This tunneling team promoted advanced working methods such as relay slotting in production and creatively overcame water obstacles. In August, they completely eliminated all large and small personal accidents and completed the plan three days ahead of schedule. The tunneling efficiency completed 115.2% of the state plan, the output efficiency completed 104.7%, and the cost per ton of coal was reduced by 2,089 yuan compared to the original plan. Currently, they have also proposed to complete the annual plan one and a half months ahead of schedule, increasing coal production by 9,000 tons and saving one shell of explosives per meter of tunneling. They are using this achievement to support the liberation of Taiwan.
    Personnel from the forest survey team and railway engineering team in the Greater Khingan Mountains are using practical actions to do their jobs well and welcome the convocation of the National People's Congress. The Second Brigade of the Central Forest Survey Team, which is conducting survey work in the Greater Khingan Mountains, has been working with great enthusiasm after studying and discussing the draft constitution. In previous years, they always took a few days off in August, but this year they voluntarily canceled their vacations. On August 24, after completing the survey task in one area, the members of the Sixth Detachment immediately carried things weighing 70 to 80 pounds, braved the heavy rain, crossed several mountains, rushed to the destination 80 miles away, and quickly threw themselves into work. Now, each detachment has revised its original plan to ensure that the survey task is completed 20 days ahead of schedule. The workers of the Tuligou Railway Engineering Team of the Yalin Line have been laying tracks and driving spikes on the line from Tuligou to Genghe since August 1 in order to welcome the convocation of the National People's Congress meeting. Now the paving and spiking project has crossed the Yituli River, and they are confident that they will ensure that trains will drive into the hinterland of the primeval forest on National Day.
    In the Xinghuo Collective Farm, where Jin Bai-Shan, the chairman of the collective farm who was elected as a representative to the National People's Congress, is located, the farm members are taking practical actions to increase production and ensure harvests to welcome the convocation of the National People's Congress meeting. In order to do a good job in increasing production and ensuring harvests, the leading cadres and technicians of the farm have conducted a comprehensive inspection of the growth of the farm's 400 hectares of rice, and determined the harvest date according to the growth situation. During the inspection, it was found that more than 30 hectares of late-maturing varieties of rice could only be harvested after the early frost period. In order to promote the early maturity of these rice plants, prevent them from being attacked by frost, and ensure increased production, the farm has now prepared enough firewood for smoking, and is prepared to use smoking methods to promote the early maturity of late rice. In addition, the work of removing water from the rice fields to create conditions for machine harvesting is nearing completion; the work of repairing roads is about to begin. When the harvest period of about ten days arrives, the harvest work of the fourth bumper year after the establishment of the farm will begin. The farm members are full of confidence as they look at the large rice fields, and they are looking forward to the good news of the bumper harvest.
    The Yin Weichen Vegetable Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Beijing is further carrying out the Red Flag Competition, with the practical action of rushing to plant and expand the sowing area to ensure a large supply of vegetables to the capital, to welcome the upcoming National People's Congress. As of September 2, the entire cooperative had planted more than 180 mu of Chinese cabbage, and 210 mu could be planted before the 6th, which is half as much as the original plan of 140 mu. In addition, it has also begun to increase the sowing of 80 to 90 mu of early-maturing vegetables, which can be harvested in more than 200,000 jin in 20 days, to supply the needs of the capital in September and October. Now, while rushing to plant, they are strengthening field management. The first planted vegetables have grown six or seven fat and tender leaves after cultivation and fertilization. The production enthusiasm of the cooperative members has reached an unprecedented level during this stage. Except for individual sick or personal leave, the attendance rate of male labor force in each team has reached 100%, and the female labor force is also above 80%. In the Red Flag Competition, in addition to ensuring that nearly 500 mu of vegetable fields are all planted, they are also preparing to change more than 60 mu of irrigated wheat fields to Chinese cabbage.
    The Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative in Gaozhuangzi Village, Lingyuan County, Rehe Province, decided to greet the first session of the First National People's Congress with the practical action of over-increasing production of 21,000 jin of grain. After discussion, the cooperative members unanimously resolved to further strengthen field management during the off-season, and on the basis of completing this year's grain production plan, increase production by another 21,000 jin of grain as a gift to the National People's Congress. All the cooperative members are working happily in the fields. More than 20 male and female cooperative members in the Third Production Team launched a competition while pruning and pinching cotton fields. More than 40 male and female cooperative members in the First Production Team cleared all the weeds from the ends of the 400 mu of large fields contracted in one day. Cooperative member Li Sheng goes to the field every day to check for pests and diseases. He said: "This is a crop dedicated to the National People's Congress, so we can't let the insects bite it." Now the cotton plants have generally blossomed, and the sorghum and millet have grown even more vigorously, with heavy ears drooping.
