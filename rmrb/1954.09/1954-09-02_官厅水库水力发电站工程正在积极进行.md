    The construction of the first hydropower station in North China is actively underway next to the famous Guanting Reservoir on the Yongding River. Four months ago, it was a barren mountain covered with thorns. Today, bulldozer operators, pneumatic drill operators, and laborers have cleared more than 100,000 cubic meters of soil and stone, transforming it into a huge construction site. A large red banner reading "Enthusiastically launch a labor emulation campaign to ensure that electricity is delivered to Beijing by the end of 1955" stands out even more strikingly against the backdrop of the emerald green peaks.
    The hydropower station construction site stretches along the Guanting Reservoir spillway, across the mountains, and onto the Yongding River滩. To connect the north and south sides of the construction site for transportation, stonemasons have split open the mountain ridge and built a "top line road" that is one kilometer long. Stonemasons building the "bottom line road" are also working on splitting the mountain. The inlet of the hydropower station's water diversion tunnel is nearing completion. In the past two months, stonemasons have removed nearly 10,000 cubic meters of stone here, cutting off a large part of the foot of the mountain. Preparations are now underway to tunnel through the mountain's belly and excavate a large tunnel. The water diversion tunnel excavation is being carried out simultaneously from both ends. At the other end, pneumatic drill operators from the Bo Shan Reservoir construction site in the Huai River are battling solid rock. In just a month and a half, they have extended the main tunnel nearly sixty meters forward. Once this tunnel is completed, it will be more than two hundred meters longer than the Guanting Reservoir's water conveyance tunnel. At the power plant construction site, stonemasons are also wearing safety ropes, hanging on cliffs, and cutting away the foot of the mountain that obstructs the construction of the plant. In the past two months, they have cut away more than 12,000 cubic meters of stone.
    The workers constructing the hydropower station have demonstrated a high degree of creativity and labor enthusiasm. The "roller machine" created by young labor models Peng Songbai, Mao Guogao, and young worker Song Dalian, can replace manual labor to manufacture ventilation pipes inside the tunnel. A large sheet of four-millimeter-thick iron plate can be skillfully rolled into a semicircle in just four or five seconds. In the past, four people used heavy tools to beat it for a day, making at most forty pieces, but after using the "roller machine," four hundred pieces can be made every day. Workers excavating the tunnel promoted the "upper pilot tunnel excavation method" and the "five-section shed support method," ensuring safe excavation. Since the start of excavation on May 16, no major accidents have occurred. The electromechanical engineering team led by Communist Party member Zheng Fuxuan, who won the title of special-class labor model in the Guanting Reservoir project, ensures that wherever the work progresses, electrical, water pipe, ventilation and other equipment are installed in a timely manner. In the early morning, the early shift workers get up even earlier than the sun. At night, the construction site is illuminated by searchlights and three thousand electric lights as if it were daylight, and the workers labor day and night. (Xinhua News Agency)

    官厅水库水力发电站工程正在积极进行
    华北地区第一座水力发电站的兴建工程，正在著名的永定河官厅水库旁边积极进行。四个月以前还是长满荆棘的荒山，今天，推土机手、风钻手和民工们已清除了十多万公方的泥土和石头，把它变成了巨大的建设阵地。“热烈开展劳动竞赛运动，保证在一九五五年底把电送到北京”的大幅红布标语，在翠绿的山峰衬映下，显得更加醒目。
    水电站工地沿着官厅水库溢洪道，越过山岭，伸展到永定河滩上。为了联系山南山北的工地运输，石工们已劈开山岭，筑成一条长达一公里的“上线公路”。修建“下线公路”的石工们也正在做劈山工作。水电站引水隧洞的进水口快要开好，两个月来，石工们在这里开除石头近一万公方，把山脚切掉了一大块。现在正在准备凿通山肚，开挖大隧洞。引水隧洞的开凿工程是分两头同时进行的。在另一头，来自淮河薄山水库工地的风钻手们正在和坚石展开搏斗，只一个半月的功夫，他们已把隧洞的正洞向前伸展了近六十公尺。这条隧洞开好以后，将比官厅水库的输水隧洞还要长二百多公尺。在发电厂房工地上，石工们也正在系着安全绳，吊在悬崖上，切削阻碍建厂的山脚。两个月来，他们已切去石头一万二千多公方。
    建设水电站的职工们表现了高度的创造性和劳动热情。年青的劳动模范彭松栢、毛国高和青年工人宋大连等所创造的“滚筒机”，可以代替体力劳动制造隧洞内的通风管，一大张四公厘厚的铁板，只用四、五秒钟的功夫就把它巧妙地卷成半圆，过去四个人用笨重的工具敲打一天，最多不过制作四十块，使用“滚筒机”后每天可做四百块。开挖隧洞的工人推广“上部导坑开凿法”和“五节棚子支柱法”，保障了安全掘进，自五月十六日开挖以来，从未发生过重大事故。在官厅水库工程中荣获特等劳动模范称号的共产党员郑福轩所率领的机电工程中队，保证工作进展到那里，电力、水管、通风等设备也及时地安装到那里。清晨，早班工人比太阳起得还早。入夜，工地被探照灯和三千盏电灯照得如同白昼，职工们日日夜夜地劳动着。（新华社）
