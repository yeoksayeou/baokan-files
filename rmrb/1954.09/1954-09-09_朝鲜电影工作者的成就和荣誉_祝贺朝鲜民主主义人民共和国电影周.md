    The films exhibited in this "Film Week of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea" include the feature films "The Scout," "Anti-Aircraft Firing Squad," and the documentary "Masters of the Land." These politically and artistically rich films will, like magnets, tightly attract millions of viewers and are bound to deeply move every audience member. This is because each film embodies the Korean people's infinite loyalty to their country and their love and trust in their leader, Marshal Kim Il-sung, as well as their belief that peace will surely triumph over war.

    As a Chinese People's Volunteer Army anti-American aid Korea film worker, I feel particularly welcome and excited about this grand film week.

    I have personally witnessed how heroic Korean filmmakers persisted in their filming work under the frequent air raids of enemy planes. Many of their equipment and materials were bombed into scrap and ashes; however, they strongly realized the solemn responsibility they shouldered and never bowed their heads to difficulties. Difficulties certainly existed, and they were significant, many difficulties; however, in the face of the indomitable Korean filmmakers, there were no insurmountable difficulties. I have personally witnessed how they built workshops in bomb craters and among broken walls; they combined the battlefield and the studio, and they produced many excellent films in the interweaving of fire and blood. During the three years of the liberation war, they disregarded all hardships and dangers and created many feature films, documentaries, and newsreels with the highest patriotism and heroism, giving full play to the organizing and mobilizing role of film art. This is the greatest achievement of Korean filmmakers and their most honorable contribution.

    Each film screened at this Korean Film Week demonstrates the outstanding talents of Korean filmmakers, who strictly follow Marshal Kim Il-sung's instructions on literary and artistic creation. At the same time, they constantly absorb the advanced theories and experiences of Soviet film art. Every scene I saw has complete color tones and a novel, simple style. In terms of the structure of the themes and the development of the plot, the embodiment of the inner world and identity of the characters, or in the form of atmosphere and rhythm, they all have strong vitality and unique creativity. They have given me great education and inspiration. I sincerely thank the comrades who created these masterpieces: Han Sang-un (screenwriter of "The Scout" and "Anti-Aircraft Firing Squad"), Kang Hong-sik (director of "Anti-Aircraft Firing Squad"), Jeon Dong-min (director of "The Scout"), Shin Young-soon (screenwriter of "Masters of the Land"), Kim Ha-yeon (director of "Masters of the Land"), Hwang Han-jo (cinematographer of "Masters of the Land"), Park Hak ("The Scout" and "Anti-Aircraft Firing Squad" main actor) and other staff. I congratulate them and look forward to them achieving greater harvests in the great peaceful socialist construction of their motherland under the leadership of Marshal Kim Il-sung.

    The story background of the films "The Scout" and "Anti-Aircraft Firing Squad" is the autumn and winter of 1950, when, due to the counterattack of the Korean People's Army and the subsequent support of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the American aggressors and the Syngman Rhee bandit army had retreated south of the 38th parallel, but they were still struggling, trying to save their own defeat with fierce artillery fire and bombing. At this time, the Korean and Chinese people's troops fought side by side, displaying unparalleled resourcefulness and bravery, striking and eliminating the enemy. "The Scout" depicts a small team of Korean People's Army scouts, led by Deputy Section Chief Li Xueche, who penetrated deep behind enemy lines, overcoming numerous difficulties and dangers, obtained important enemy information, and then were ordered to cooperate with the frontal troops in a general attack, destroying the enemy's artillery positions. "Anti-Aircraft Firing Squad" depicts the Korean People's Army responding to Marshal Kim Il-sung's order to eliminate American air pirates with infantry weapons. As a result, in six months, the anti-aircraft firing squad shot down 1,155 enemy planes, making the enemy mistakenly believe that there were new weapons on every mountain in Korea.

    Both of these films vividly illustrate the patriotic spirit of the Korean People's Army, who implemented Marshal Kim Il-sung's call, always remembering the teaching that "to hate the enemy is to love the country," and therefore were able to carry out arduous battles and give the enemy a heavy blow.

    The historical background of the film "Masters of the Land" is 1952. The war was still going on, and Marshal Kim Il-sung called on farmers to fight for increased production and saving of grain. As a result, Korean farmers overcame various difficulties during the war, making the harvest of that year not only exceed that of 1951, but also exceed the highest annual output in the history of democratic Korea in 1948. This film fully demonstrates how the Korean people established meritorious service for their motherland with diligence and bravery.

    I don't want to, and don't need to, waste space introducing the detailed plots of these films. The audience will see on the screen Deputy Section Chief Li Xueche of the reconnaissance section, who is full of courage, the People's Army machine gunner Kim Man-sik, the outstanding agricultural laborers Kim Rak-hee, Jeon Chang-ok, Kim Ji-bok, Lim Kwang-seop... see those working people who hate the American bandits to the core, see those who dedicated their youth and love to the motherland - just like seeing our own cause, and our own flesh and blood brothers.

    The friendship between the Chinese and Korean people has a long history. The friendship between Chinese and Korean filmmakers also has a deep foundation. I remember in the late autumn of 1950, my partners and I wrote a letter to Korean filmmakers, mentioning that all the comrades of our film crew repeatedly watched their documentary films that accused the U.S. imperialism of cruelly killing the Korean people, which increased our hatred for U.S. imperialism. Our fifty-eight news photography teams are ready to fully support them.

    In the severe cold season of early winter in 1950, we followed the Volunteer Army to Korea. Since then, we and Korean filmmakers fought side by side, like brothers, learning from each other, living in the same tunnel, and working on the same position. Although our close comrade-in-arms, the young photographer Comrade Yang Xuzhong, shed his last drop of blood on the front line of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea; however, we feel honored and proud because this blood was shed on the heroic land and for a common cause.

    We will never forget those years in Korea when the Korean people treated us like their most beloved children. We cherish the friendship with the Korean people the most, because this friendship is forged with blood and conscience.

    Here, I would like to once again express my heartfelt gratitude and respect to the heroic Korean filmmakers. It can be predicted that this Korean Film Week will surely successfully complete its mission, and the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean people will be deeper and closer.

### 朝鲜电影工作者的成就和荣誉——祝贺朝鲜民主主义人民共和国电影周

    朝鲜电影工作者的成就和荣誉
    ——祝贺朝鲜民主主义人民共和国电影周
  　徐肖冰
    在这次“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国电影周”展览的影片，有故事片“侦察兵”、“对空射击组”和纪录片“土地的主人”。这些富有政治性与艺术性的影片，将像磁石一般紧紧地吸引住千百万观众，也必然使每个观众受到极大的感动。因为每一部影片里都凝结着朝鲜人民对祖国的无限忠诚和对自己底领袖——金日成元帅的爱戴和信任，也凝结着对和平一定战胜战争的信念。
    我作为中国人民志愿抗美援朝的一个电影工作者，对于这次盛大的电影周感到格外欢迎和兴奋。
    我曾亲眼看到：英雄的朝鲜电影工作者，怎样在敌人飞机的频繁的空袭下面，坚持拍摄工作。他们的许多设备和器材，都被炸成了废品和灰烬；但是，他们强烈地意识到自己所担当的庄严的责任，从来也不向困难低头。困难当然是有的，而且是很大的困难，许多的困难；不过，在不屈的朝鲜电影工作者的面前，却没有不可克服的困难。我曾亲眼看到：他们就在炸弹坑内和断墙残壁之间，修建了工作间；他们把战场和摄影棚结合在一起，他们在火与血的交织中制作了许多出色的影片。在三年的解放战争中，他们不顾一切艰难和危险，创作了许多具有最高尚的爱国主义和英雄气概的故事片、纪录片和新闻片，发挥了电影艺术的组织作用和鼓动作用，这是朝鲜电影工作者最伟大的成就，也是他们最荣誉的贡献。
    这次朝鲜电影周放映的每部影片，都显示了朝鲜电影工作者的卓越才能，他们严正地遵照金日成元帅对文艺创作方面的指示。同时，他们不断地吸取苏联电影艺术的先进理论与先进经验。我所看到的每一个画面，都具有完整的色调，具有新颖的朴素的风格。他们在题材的结构和情节的发展方面，对角色的内心世界和身份的体现，或在气氛和节奏的形式上，都有强烈的生命力和独特的创造性。它们给予我莫大的教育与启示。我挚诚地感谢创作这些杰作的战友们：韩相运（“侦察兵”和“对空射击组”的编剧）、姜弘植（“对空射击组”的导演）、全东民（“侦察兵”的导演）、申永淳（“土地的主人”的编剧）、金河渊（“土地的主人”的导演）、黄汉祚（“土地的主人”摄影师）、朴学（“侦察兵”和“对空射击组”的主要演员）和其他的工作人员。我祝贺他们并期待他们，在金日成元帅领导下，从事祖国伟大的和平的社会主义建设事业中，获得更重大的丰收。
    影片“侦察兵”和“对空射击组”的故事背景是一九五○年秋冬，那时由于朝鲜人民军的反攻和以后中国人民志愿军的支援，美国侵略者和李承晚匪军已经败退到三八线以南，但是他们还在挣扎，用猛烈的炮火和飞机轰炸企图挽救他们自己的败绩。这时朝中人民部队并肩作战，发挥着无比的机智和勇敢，打击和消灭敌人。“侦察兵”描写一小队朝鲜人民军的侦察兵在副科长李学哲领导下深入敌后，冲过了千难万险，获得了敌军重要情报，接着他们又奉命配合正面部队总攻击，击毁了敌人的炮兵阵地。“对空射击组”描写了当时朝鲜人民军响应金日成元帅的命令，以步兵武器消灭美国的空中强盗。结果在六个月内，对空射击组击落了敌机一千一百五十五架，使得敌人错认为在朝鲜每一个山头上，有了新式武器。
    这两部片子，都形象地说明了朝鲜人民军的爱国主义精神，他们贯彻了金日成元帅的号召，时时刻刻记得“要痛恨敌人，才能热爱祖国”的教诲，因此也才能进行艰苦的战斗，给敌人以狠狠的打击。
    影片“土地的主人”的时代背景是一九五二年，战争仍在进行，金日成元帅号召农民为增产和节约粮食而斗争，结果朝鲜农民克服了战争时期的种种困难，使得这一年的收获量不只超过了一九五一年，而且超过了民主朝鲜历史上最高年产量的一九四八年。这部影片充分表现了朝鲜人民怎样用勤劳和勇敢对祖国建立了功勋。
    我不想也不必要耗费篇幅来介绍这些影片的详细情节。观众们将从银幕上看到那位一身是胆的侦察科副科长李学哲，看到人民军机枪射手金万植，看到卓越的农业劳动者金乐姬、全昌玉、金志福、林光燮……看到那些恨透了美国强盗的劳动人民，看到那些把自己的青春和爱情都献给祖国的人们——就像看到我们自己的事业，和我们的骨肉弟兄一样。
    中朝两国人民的友谊，有长远的历史。中国电影工作者和朝鲜电影工作者的友情，也有深厚的基础。记得在一九五○年的秋末，我和自己的伙伴们，曾经给朝鲜电影工作者写过一封信，谈到我们全体摄影队的同志一再看了他们向全人类控诉美帝残酷杀害朝鲜人民暴行的纪实影片，增加了我们对美国帝国主义的仇恨，我们五十八个新闻摄影队，准备好了一切，全心全意作他们的后盾。
    在一九五○年初冬的严寒季节里，我们随着志愿军到了朝鲜。从此，我们和朝鲜电影工作者并肩作战，像亲兄弟一样在一道，互相学习，生活在一个坑道里，也在一个阵地上工作。虽然，我们的亲密战友，年轻的摄影师——杨序忠同志，在抗美援朝的最前线，流尽了自己最后一滴血；可是，我们为了这些鲜血是洒在英雄的国土上，洒在共同的事业上而感到光荣和骄傲。
    我们永远忘不了在朝鲜那些年月里，朝鲜人民把我们当作自己最心爱的子女一样看待。我们最珍惜和朝鲜人民的友谊，因为这种友谊是血和良心结成的。
    在这里，我愿再一次向英雄的朝鲜电影工作者，表示我心底的感激和尊敬。可以预料，这一次朝鲜电影周一定会胜利地完成它的使命，中朝人民的战斗友谊会更加深厚和亲密。（附图片）
