    Yumen Refinery's high melting point asphalt workshop, a major construction project of the Yumen Mining Bureau Refinery, has been successfully completed and has begun production. On the afternoon of September 1st, the first batch of high melting point asphalt was successfully produced. The daily output of this workshop has increased sixteen to twenty times compared to the previous small-scale production. From now on, the asphalt raw materials that have been abandoned on the Gobi Desert for many years can be used to support the needs of national industrial construction.
    In May of this year, when the Yumen Mining Bureau Refinery was producing high melting point asphalt on a small scale, factories in Fushun, Nanjing, Tianjin, Xi'an, and other places wrote letters requesting samples and placing orders. To meet the needs of these factories, the Yumen Mining Bureau began construction of the high melting point asphalt workshop on July 1st. The employees participating in the construction overcame the difficulties of excavation and making large asphalt pots, and finally completed the project as scheduled. The equipment in this workshop has many improvements in terms of antifreeze and cooling performance, making it safe and easy for workers to operate. (Xinhua News Agency)

    玉门炼油厂高溶点沥青车间开工生产
    玉门矿务局炼油厂兴建的高溶点沥青车间主要工程胜利完工，并且开始生产。九月一日下午已顺利地生产出第一锅高溶点沥青。这个车间的日产量比过去小规模生产时增加了十六倍到二十倍。从此，很多年来被弃置在戈壁滩上的沥青原料，将可用来支援国家工业建设的需要了。
    今年五月份，玉门矿务局炼油厂小规模生产高溶点沥青时，抚顺、南京、天津、西安等地的一些工厂就写信索取样品，并要求订货。玉门矿务局为供应这些工厂的需要，从七月一日起，就开始兴建高溶点沥青车间，参加建设工程的职工克服了挖土方和制大型沥青锅的困难，终于如期完工。这座车间的设备在防冻和冷却性能方面都有许多改进，工人们操作起来既安全又简便。　　　（新华社）
