Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 22nd - Wuhan citizens are gradually developing a habit of economical consumption - planning their family life according to a plan. Since the implementation of planned supply for grain, cooking oil, and cotton cloth, citizens have gradually become accustomed to using Sundays, or the days when government offices and enterprises issue wages, to go to the city's thousand or so public-private joint grain, cooking oil, and cloth shops to purchase the goods they need according to plan. One day after the implementation of planned cotton cloth supply, Bao Suqing, a resident of Jiaoyi Street and family member of a construction worker, told reporters: "Neighbors in my area now have a plan for their lives. Take me, for example, since the planned supply of grain and cooking oil, my family also makes a monthly plan. At the beginning of the month, I take out my salary and first buy a month's worth of grain and cooking oil according to the plan, then allocate the remaining money for rent, utilities, children's tuition, groceries, and pocket money. Everything is accounted for." Yang Xingui, a family member of an electrician from Fangzheng Lane, Hualou Street, told reporters that one of her neighbors in the front yard, a mother and daughter, had a monthly income of more than 300,000 yuan; in the past, they would buy firewood, rice, oil, and salt at will after receiving their salary, and often owe the vegetable market money by the end of the month. Now that they have a plan for buying rice, oil, and cloth, the money is enough.

Since Wuhan City implemented the planned supply of grain, citizens have purchased grain according to their monthly plans, and the city's grain consumption has remained at a normal level. The order of citizens purchasing grain according to plan is very good. Therefore, the number of supply points needed to sell the same amount of grain in the city has decreased from more than 500 in the initial period of planned supply to more than 300. Since the planned supply of cooking oil, a gratifying trend of saving cooking oil can be seen everywhere. Cooks and housewives are increasing the variety of stir-fried dishes, steamed dishes, and braised dishes to save cooking oil. Every month, people return their surplus oil purchase coupons to the People's Government. According to the Wuhan City Company of the China Oils and Fats Company, from April to July, the people of the city have saved more than 100 tons of cooking oil.

    在粮食、食油、棉布实行计划供应后
    武汉市民养成按计划安排家庭生活的习惯
    【新华社武汉二十二日电】武汉市民逐渐养成一种节约消费的习惯——按计划来安排家庭生活。由于粮食、食油、棉布实行了计划供应，市民已经逐渐习惯利用星期天，或是在机关、企业发工资的日子，到全市一千来家公私营粮食、食油和布匹商店，按计划购买他们所需的商品。在棉布实行计划供应后的一天，交易街居民、建筑工人家属包素清告诉记者：“我这一带邻居，如今家家过日子都有个计划了。就比如我吧，自从粮食、食油计划供应后，我一家生活也按月作个计划。月初拿出工资，先按计划买了一月的粮食、食油，下余房租水电费、小孩的学费、小菜钱、零用钱，样样也都心中有了个数。”花楼街方正里水电工人家属杨新桂告诉记者，她前院有一邻居，娘儿俩个每月收入三十多万元；往常拿到工资，柴米油盐随意买，往往到月底就赊欠着菜市场的钱，这几个月买米买油买布都有了计划，钱也够用了。
    武汉市自从实行粮食计划供应以来，市民们按每月的计划购买粮食，全市粮食消费量一直保持在正常的水平，市民们按计划购粮秩序很好，因而全市销售同样多粮食所需要的供应点，已由计划供应初期的五百多个成为三百多个了。食油计划供应以来，到处已能看到一种可喜的节约食油的风气。厨工和家庭主妇们增多烧菜、蒸菜、卤菜的花样，来节约食油。月月都有人把节余的购油票送还人民政府。据中国油脂公司武汉市公司计算，从四月到七月，全市人民已节省了一百多吨食油。
