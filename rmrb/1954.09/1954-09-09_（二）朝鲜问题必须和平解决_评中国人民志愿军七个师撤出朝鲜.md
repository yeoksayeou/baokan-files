    (II) The Korean Question Must Be Resolved Peacefully
     — On the Withdrawal of Seven Divisions of the Chinese People’s Volunteers from Korea
    According to an announcement by the spokesperson of the Headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers, seven divisions of the Chinese People's Volunteers will be withdrawn from Korea and return to China in September and October of this year. This once again demonstrates the sincerity and confidence of the Chinese people in peacefully resolving the Korean question.
    The Chinese people have always been peace-loving. Just as the joint declaration of the Chinese democratic parties on November 4, 1950, in support of the nation's resistance against the U.S. and aid to Korea stated: "The Chinese people deeply love peace. We have always wanted peace in the past, and we will always want peace in the future. We want peace for China, we want peace for Asia, and we want lasting peace for all mankind throughout the world." The reason why the Chinese people launched the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and dispatched volunteers to fight abroad was precisely for this noble purpose. At that time, the flames of war in Korea, ignited by U.S. imperialism, had already reached the banks of the Yalu River. China's security was under serious threat, and world peace was also under serious threat. At that time, the Chinese people had to take the righteous action of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to defend the security of the motherland and world peace. Any hesitation or waiting would only embolden the aggressors. This action of the Chinese people was entirely righteous. The Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, after two years and nine months of arduous struggle, finally stopped the aggression of U.S. imperialism, extinguished the flames of war burning on Korean soil, and prevented China's security and world peace from being undermined. This is a great contribution of the Chinese people to maintaining world peace, and any fair historian will have to write a great deal about this contribution.
      The victory of the Chinese and Korean peoples in resisting U.S. aggression and the realization of the Korean armistice not only encouraged the courage and confidence of peace-loving people around the world in stopping aggression and opposing war, but more importantly, set an example for resolving international disputes through peaceful consultation. The Geneva Accords on the restoration of peace in Indochina are another major victory for peaceful consultation and another major victory in the cause of maintaining world peace. Facts have proven that the era of the United States doing whatever it wants in interfering in and invading other countries has passed, and the United States' insistence on its policy of strength of expanding its military and preparing for war is becoming increasingly untenable. The failure of the U.S. war of aggression in Korea, the failure of the U.S. to expand the war in Indochina, and the failure of the U.S. to force France to accept the European Defense Community Treaty all prove this point. However, the United States is still unwilling to accept its defeat and continues to adhere to its old policy of creating international tensions and opposing peaceful consultations. This bankrupt policy of the United States is particularly prominent in the peaceful resolution of the Korean question.
    Although the Korean War has stopped, the Korean armistice has been in an unstable state, and the Korean question has not been resolved peacefully. The key lies in the lack of sincerity on the part of the United States in peacefully resolving the Korean question. As soon as the Korean War stopped, the United States violated the provisions of the armistice agreement regarding the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and actually signed a "common defense treaty" with the Syngman Rhee group in South Korea for the long-term stationing of U.S. troops in South Korea. The United States also undermined the authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, hijacked more than 48,000 non-directly repatriated prisoners of war from the Korean-Chinese side, and also obstructed the convening of the Korean Political Conference, and continuously transported a large amount of reinforcement combat materials into South Korea to strengthen Syngman Rhee's armed forces. At the Geneva Conference on the peaceful settlement of the Korean question, the destructive methods of the United States reached the most barbaric and unreasonable level. The U.S. delegation not only adopted a completely negative and obliterated attitude toward the reasonable proposals of the Korean-Chinese-Soviet Union, but even refused to continue to seek a peaceful settlement of the Korean question and to assume the obligation to guarantee that Korean peace would not be threatened. The hideous face of the U.S. aggressive clique, fearing the complete exposure of the peaceful settlement of the Korean question, was revealed. During and after the Geneva Conference, the U.S. plot to undermine the Korean armistice has been continuing. Van Fleet's visit to South Korea, Syngman Rhee's talks with the United States in Washington, the U.S. proposal to dissolve the "Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission" that maintains the Korean armistice, and the recent U.S. plan to further expand Syngman Rhee's army and provide Syngman Rhee's army with naval and air force assistance are sufficient to illustrate this issue.
    Despite this, the Chinese people are still full of confidence in the peaceful settlement of the Korean question. This is primarily because the Korean and Chinese people have already made tremendous efforts to peacefully resolve the Korean question, and they have achieved positive results. The cessation of the Korean War is the first step toward the peaceful settlement of the Korean question. For more than a year since the armistice, although the United States and Syngman Rhee have adopted various means to undermine the armistice, the unshakable strength and will of the Korean and Chinese people to maintain the Korean armistice have prevented all the enemy's conspiracies from succeeding. Since the Korean and Chinese people have won the armistice, they can also win the peaceful settlement of the Korean question, and the Korean people will certainly be able to achieve the independence and unification of their motherland in accordance with their wishes. The proposition of resolving international disputes through peaceful consultation has increasingly taken root in the hearts of the people and has become the trend of the times and the aspiration of the people. No international issue cannot be handled through peaceful consultation among the countries concerned, and the Korean issue is no exception. The statement issued by DPRK Foreign Minister Nam Il on July 6 summarizing the Geneva Conference on the peaceful settlement of the Korean question, the Soviet government's statement on the Geneva Conference on July 23, and the speech by Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai at the Geneva Conference on July 21 all unanimously expressed the desire and determination to peacefully resolve the Korean question. Together with the peace-loving forces of the world, this is the basic guarantee that the Korean question must be resolved peacefully.
    The withdrawal of seven divisions of the Chinese People's Volunteers best illustrates the Chinese people's sincerity and confidence in peacefully resolving the Korean question. However, before the final peaceful settlement of the Korean question, the Chinese people will never lose vigilance against the other side's plot to undermine the Korean armistice, and will never relax preparations to crush any provocation by the enemy. If the U.S. aggressive clique and its running dog Syngman Rhee think that the withdrawal of seven divisions of the Chinese People's Volunteers is an opportunity to be seized and dare to provoke a war, the Chinese people and the Korean people will, as in the past, give the aggressors a head-on blow.

    （二）朝鲜问题必须和平解决
     ——评中国人民志愿军七个师撤出朝鲜
    据中国人民志愿军总部发言人宣布，中国人民志愿军的七个师，将于今年九、十两月从朝鲜撤出回国。这又一次表示了中国人民和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意和信心。
    中国人民从来就是爱好和平的。正像一九五○年十一月四日中国各民主党派为支持全国人民抗美援朝斗争的联合宣言所宣布的：“中国人民是酷爱和平的。我们以前一向要和平，我们今后永远要和平。我们要中国的和平，我们要亚洲的和平，我们要全世界全人类的持久和平。”中国人民当时所以发动抗美援朝斗争，所以派遣志愿军出国作战，正是为了这个崇高目的。当时美帝国主义一手点燃的朝鲜战火已经燃烧到鸭绿江边。中国的安全受着严重的威胁，世界和平也受着严重的威胁。当时中国人民必须采取抗美援朝的正义行动来保卫祖国的安全和世界的和平，任何犹豫和观望，都会助长侵略者的凶焰。中国人民这种行动是完全正义的。中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军在一起，经过了两年又九个月艰苦卓绝的斗争，终于制止了美帝国主义的侵略，扑灭了在朝鲜土地上延烧的战火，使中国的安全及世界和平不致遭到破坏。这是中国人民对维护世界和平的伟大贡献，任何公正的历史家都要对这种贡献大书特书的。
      中朝人民反抗美国侵略的胜利和朝鲜停战的实现，不仅鼓舞了全世界爱好和平人民制止侵略反对战争的勇气和信心，更重要的是树立了用和平协商方式解决国际争端的榜样。日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平的协议是和平协商的又一重大胜利，是维护世界和平事业中的又一重大胜利。事实已经证明，美国干涉和侵略别国的为所欲为的时代已经过去了，美国坚持它的扩军备战的实力政策已经越来越行不通了。美国侵略朝鲜战争的失败，美国扩大印度支那战争的失败，美国强迫法国接受欧洲防务集团条约的失败，都证明了这一点。但是美国始终不甘心于它的失败，继续坚持它制造国际紧张局势，反对和平协商的老政策。美国这种破了产的政策，在和平解决朝鲜问题上表现得尤其突出。
    朝鲜战争虽然停止了，但朝鲜停战一直处于不稳定的状态，朝鲜问题一直不能得到和平解决，关键就在于美国缺乏和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意。朝鲜战争刚刚停止，美国就违反了停战协定关于一切外国军队撤出朝鲜的规定，竟然和南朝鲜的李承晚集团签订了美军长期留驻南朝鲜的“共同防御条约”。美国又破坏了中立国遣返委员会的职权范围，劫走了朝中方面四万八千多名不直接遣返的战俘，美国还阻挠了朝鲜政治会议的召开，并且不断把大量增援性的作战物资运进南朝鲜去加强李承晚的武装力量。在日内瓦会议上关于和平解决朝鲜问题的讨论，美国的破坏手段达到了最蛮横无理的程度。美国代表团不但对朝中苏三国的合理建议采取了一概否定和抹煞的态度，甚至对继续寻求和平解决朝鲜问题的可能性，担负保证朝鲜和平不受威胁的义务也全部加以拒绝。美国侵略集团害怕朝鲜问题和平解决的狰狞面目彻底暴露。而在日内瓦会议期间和日内瓦会议以后，美国破坏朝鲜停战的阴谋一直在继续着。战争贩子范佛里特到南朝鲜的访问，李承晚到华盛顿和美国的会谈，美国主张解散维护朝鲜停战的“中立国监察委员会”以及最近美国计划进一步扩大李承晚军队和给予李承晚军队海军和空军的援助，都已足够说明这一问题。
    尽管这样，中国人民还是对朝鲜问题的和平解决充满信心的。这首先是因为朝中人民为和平解决朝鲜问题已经作了巨大的努力，也得到了肯定的效果，朝鲜战争的停止就是和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步。停战一年多以来，美国和李承晚虽然采取了各种各样破坏停战的手段，但由于朝中人民维护朝鲜停战的不可动摇的力量和意志，使得对方的一切阴谋诡计不能得逞。朝中人民既然赢得了停战，也能够赢得朝鲜问题的和平解决，朝鲜人民一定能够按照他们的意愿获得他们祖国的独立和统一。用和平协商的办法解决国际争端的主张已经日益深入人心，已经变成潮流之所趋，人心之所向。没有任何国际问题不能用有关国家和平协商的办法来处理，朝鲜问题也不能例外。七月六日朝鲜民主主义人民共和国南日外务相就总结日内瓦会议关于和平解决朝鲜问题的讨论发表的声明，七月二十三日苏联政府关于日内瓦会议的声明，七月二十一日我国周恩来总理在日内瓦会议上的发言都一致表示了和平解决朝鲜问题的愿望和决心，加上全世界爱好和平的力量，这就是朝鲜问题一定要和平解决的基本保证。
    中国人民志愿军七个师的撤出，最好地说明了中国人民对和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意和信心。但是，在朝鲜问题最后和平解决之前，中国人民永远也不会失掉对对方破坏朝鲜停战阴谋的警惕，永远也不会放松粉碎敌人任何挑衅的准备。美国侵略集团和它的走狗李承晚要是以为中国人民志愿军七个师的撤出是可乘之隙，胆敢挑起战端的话，中国人民和朝鲜人民将会像过去一样，给侵略者以迎头痛击。
