Over the past five years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, agricultural production nationwide has been rapidly restored and developed due to the victorious land reform and the large-scale mutual aid and cooperation movement. By 1952, the national agricultural production level had exceeded the pre-war production level.

In the past two years, under the leadership of the Chinese working class, the broad masses of farmers have actively participated in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. The number of farmer households participating in mutual aid teams and cooperatives has now reached 60 percent of all farmer households. The number of agricultural production cooperatives nationwide was more than 14,900 in 1953, and by August of this year, it had grown to 100,000. The socialist position in the countryside has expanded, and the agricultural production increase movement has been carried out more extensively and deeply, with continuous increases in the output of grain, cotton, and various crops.

The rapid restoration and development of agricultural production is of great significance for supporting national industrial construction. Now, inspired by the general task of the state during the transition period, the nation's farmers are participating in the agricultural collectivization movement with even greater enthusiasm, striving to increase the production of more grain and industrial raw materials, support the country, and struggle to realize socialist industrialization!

The development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement has opened up broad avenues for improving agricultural production. These are farmers in the Sichuan Plain, most of whom have already organized themselves, and their rice has yielded a bumper harvest.

The acreage and output of cotton in our country have been expanded and improved since the national liberation. The field management work of the Jianguo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dongchengfang Township, Gaoling County, Shaanxi Province, has been done well, and the cotton they grow has a higher yield than the surrounding individual farmers and mutual aid teams. These are the members picking cotton.

With the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, improving agricultural technology has become an urgent requirement for farmers to develop production. By the end of 1953, the state had established more than 3,600 agricultural technology extension stations across the country to help farmers improve production technology. These are the staff of the Guangji Agricultural Technology Extension Station in Jingyang County, Shaanxi Province (second from the left) guiding the members of the Hongxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in cotton pruning.

Our country's state-owned agriculture has made great progress in recent years. By the end of 1953, there were 59 mechanized farms and 2,281 local state-owned farms nationwide. These farms undertake the important tasks of increasing grain production for the country and demonstrating to farmers. The State-owned Lutai Farm in Ninghe County, Hebei Province, reaped a bumper harvest of 8,000 mu of wheat this year. This is a tractor on the farm harvesting wheat.

Last year, our country established eleven agricultural machine tractor stations with a focus on helping organized farmers carry out mechanized operations, and these tractor stations have been increased this year. This is the Shuangcheng Tractor Station in Heilongjiang Province using a cultivator to help the Xingfu Agricultural Production Cooperative carry out cultivation and weeding.

Farmers in Nangong, Jixian, and other counties in Hebei Province transported the cotton they sold to the state to the railway station, ready to be transported to textile factories in Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places.

In addition to actively increasing the production of grain and cotton to support national industrial construction, farmers have also appropriately expanded the production of various cash crops. The several counties around Harbin are one of the main producing areas of sugar beets in our country, and the sugar factories in Harbin use the sugar beets from here as raw materials. This is a large batch of sugar beets ready to be transported to the sugar factory.

Farmers across the country sell their surplus grain to the state with soaring enthusiasm to support the country's economic construction. This is the Hongxing Collective Farm in Nanyuan District, a suburb of Beijing, delivering the wheat it sold to the state to the state granary by truck.

The rapid recovery and development of national industry has brought great benefits to agricultural production. According to incomplete statistics from 1950 to 1953, the national industry has supplied farmers across the country with more than 600,000 new-style farm implements. This is a large batch of double-wheeled, double-furrow plows produced by the Shandong Farm Implement Factory for farmers.

The production of mutual aid and cooperative organizations in various places is constantly developing, and the income of farmers is also constantly increasing. Since its establishment in 1951, the Xinghuo Collective Farm in Huachuan County, Heilongjiang Province, has had bumper harvests year after year, and the income of the villagers has also increased year by year. Last year, the average net income of each villager was 13.8 million yuan, which is two and a half times more than the income of individual farmers. These are the villagers distributing the proceeds.

    沿着农业的社会主义改造的道路前进
    中华人民共和国成立五年来，由于已经胜利地进行了改革土地制度，开展了大规模的互助合作运动，全国农业生产得到了迅速的恢复和发展。到一九五二年，全国农业生产水平就超过了战前的生产水平。
    近两年来，广大农民在中国工人阶级领导下，积极参加了互助合作运动。参加互助组和合作社的农户现在已经达到全体农户的百分之六十。全国的农业生产合作社在一九五三年是一万四千九百多个，到今年八月已经发展到十万个。社会主义在农村的阵地扩大了，农业增产运动更广泛和深入地开展起来，粮食、棉花和各种农作物的产量不断增加。
    农业生产的迅速恢复和发展，对支援国家工业建设有着重要的意义。现在全国农民在国家过渡时期总任务的鼓舞下，正以更高的热情，参加农业合作化运动，争取增产更多的粮食和工业原料，支援国家，为实现社会主义工业化而奋斗！
    农业互助合作运动的发展，为提高农业生产开辟了广阔的道路。这是大部分已经组织起来的四川平原的农民们，他们的水稻获得了丰收。

    我国棉花的播种面积和产量在全国解放后有了扩大和提高，陕西省高陵县东城坊乡建国农业生产合作社的田间管理工作做得好，他们种的棉花比周围的个体农民和互助组的产量都高。这是社员们在摘棉。

    随着互助合作运动的发展，改进农业技术已成为农民发展生产的迫切要求。到一九五三年底，国家已在全国各地建立了三千六百多个农业技术推广站，帮助农民改良生产技术。这是陕西省泾阳县广吉农业技术推广站的工作人员（左第二人）在指导红星农业生产合作社的社员们进行棉花整枝。　新华社记者　赵淮青摄
    我国的国营农业几年来有很大的发展，到一九五三年底，全国已有五十九个机械化农场和二千二百八十一个地方国营农场。这些农场担负着为国家增产粮食和向农民示范的重要任务。河北省宁河县境内的国营芦台农场今年有八千亩小麦获得了丰收。这是这个农场的拖拉机在收割小麦。　新华社稿　刘　峰摄
    去年我国有重点地建立了十一个农业机器拖拉机站，帮助组织起来的农民进行机械化作业，这些拖拉机站今年又有增加。这是黑龙江省双城拖拉机站用中耕除草机帮助幸福农业生产合作社进行中耕除草。

    河北省南宫、冀县等县农民把卖给国家的棉花运到火车站，准备运往天津、上海等地纺织厂去。新华社记者　王纯德摄
    农民们除了积极增产粮棉支援国家工业建设，还适当扩大了各种经济作物的生产。哈尔滨周围的几个县是我国甜菜的主要产区之一，哈尔滨的糖厂就是以这儿的甜菜为原料的。这是准备运往糖厂的大批甜菜。新华社稿　吴宝基摄
    全国农民以高涨的热情，把余粮卖给国家，支援国家的经济建设。这是北京市郊南苑区红星集体农庄把卖给国家的小麦用卡车送到了国家粮库。新华社稿　冯文冈摄
    全国农民，特别是已经组织起来的农民，在生产发展的基础上，物质生活和文化生活都日益改善。这是河北省饶阳县五公村耿长锁农业生产合作社正在盖新房子。农业部农业电影社　顾　华摄
    国家工业的迅速恢复和发展，给农业生产带来了莫大的利益。据一九五○年到一九五三年的不完全统计，国家工业已供给了全国农民六十多万部新式农具。这是山东农具厂为农民生产的大批双轮双铧犁。

    各地互助合作组织的生产不断发展，农民的收入也不断增加。黑龙江省桦川县星火集体农庄从一九五一年建立到现在，连年丰收，庄员收入也逐年增加。去年平均每个庄员纯收入一千三百八十万元，比个体农民的收入多两倍半。这是庄员们正在分配收益。新华社稿
