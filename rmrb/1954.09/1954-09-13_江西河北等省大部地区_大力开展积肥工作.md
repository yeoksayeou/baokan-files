Large-Scale Manure Collection Efforts Underway in Most Parts of Jiangxi, Hebei and Other Provinces

    Most areas of Jiangxi, Hebei, Hubei and other provinces are vigorously carrying out manure collection work in conjunction with the campaign to exceed production targets.
    Jiangxi is mobilizing the masses to apply all existing fertilizer to late autumn crops. To solve the current fertilizer shortage and not affect next year's production, districts and townships are leading farmers to use methods such as cutting green grass and removing sod to compost fertilizer, while ensuring water and soil conservation. The Ganzhou Special District launched a district-wide manure collection campaign on August 16, requiring 20 dan of top dressing to be applied per mu of late rice fields.
    The broad masses of farmers in Hebei Province are combining weeding competitions with using weeds as green manure. In Hanjiazhuang, District One of Mancheng County, more than 620 people go to the fields every day, with men weeding in front and women and children picking up grass behind. In five days, they weeded more than 2,000 mu of land and collected more than 90,000 jin of fertilizer. In Gaocheng County, 58 agricultural production cooperatives and 20 mutual aid teams completed inter-tillage work on 6,000 mu of land in five days, removing more than 376,000 jin of weeds, which have all been composted into fertilizer. To shorten the composting time, many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams are taking the lead in implementing high-temperature composting methods. In Gaocheng County, more than 570 individual farming households, led by 184 agricultural production cooperatives and 213 mutual aid teams, have adopted high-temperature composting, accumulating a total of 315,000 cartloads of fertilizer, which has solved the fertilizer shortage.
    Manure collection efforts are also being actively carried out in non-disaster areas of Hubei Province. Jiangtai Township in Jiangling County has identified a total of nine fertilizer sources and has collected more than 40,000 dan of fertilizer. Regions that have widely launched manure collection campaigns have achieved great results. According to statistics from 540 townships in 11 counties including Xishui and Luotian, more than 20 million dan of fertilizer have been collected.

    江西河北等省大部地区
    大力开展积肥工作
    江西、河北、湖北等省大部地区，结合超额增产运动大力开展积肥工作。
    江西各地正动员群众把现有的肥料全部用到晚秋作物的田里，为了解决目前肥料不足和不影响明年生产，各区、乡正领导农民在不妨碍水土保持的原则下，利用割青草、铲草皮等方法沤制肥料。赣州专区从八月十六日起开展了全区性的积肥运动，要求在每亩晚稻田里，施追肥二十担。
    河北省广大农民结合开展锄苗竞赛，利用杂草压绿肥，满城县一区韩家庄每天有六百二十多人下地，男的前面锄苗，妇女、儿童后面拾草，五天中锄了二千多亩地，压了九万多斤肥，藁城县有五十八个农业生产合作社和二十个互助组，五天中完成了六千亩地的中耕工作，清除杂草三十七万六千多斤，已全部沤制肥料。为了缩短肥料腐熟的时间，不少农业生产合作社和互助组带头实行了高温沤肥方法。藁城县已有五百七十多户个体农户在一百八十四个农业生产合作社和二百一十三个互助组的带动下，采用高温沤肥法，共沤积了三十一万五千车肥料，解决了缺肥问题。
    湖北省非灾区的积肥运动，也积极开展。江陵县蒋台乡共找出九种肥源，已积肥四万多担。大部开展了积肥运动的地区，都已取得很大成绩，据浠水、罗田等十一个县五百四十个乡统计，已积肥二千多万担。
