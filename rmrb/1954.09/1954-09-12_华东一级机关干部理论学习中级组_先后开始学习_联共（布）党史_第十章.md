    The intermediate group of first-level organ cadres in East China completed studying Chapter Nine of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" at the end of August according to the original plan and has successively begun studying Chapter Ten from the beginning of September.
    The study of Chapter Nine of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" resumed from the beginning of June. During the study period, the lecturer of the intermediate group continued to give the second and third lectures following the first lecture given last year before studying the General Line. Because the lecturers of the intermediate group could prepare lessons carefully, most of the lectures generally reflected well.
    During the study, most cadres studied diligently and adhered to the study system. Cadres from units such as the East China Office of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, the East China Branch of the State Material Reserve Bureau, and the East China Civil Affairs Bureau all persisted in four hours of theoretical study every Saturday and also used their spare time for self-study. Most units strengthened the leadership of the study, promptly checked the study situation, and led the intermediate group tutors to carry out various forms of tutoring activities, and invited senior group cadres to make some thematic or small tutoring reports. The Organization Department and the General Office Branch of the East China Bureau organized two special reports on commercial and cooperative problems during the study of Sections Three, Four, and Five of Chapter Nine of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)," which greatly helped everyone. Units such as the East China Public Security Bureau, the East China Finance Bureau, and the East China Office of the Supply Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building of the Central Government were also able to pay attention to carrying out tutoring activities, giving play to the role of the tutoring group, helping everyone grasp the central idea of the document, find reference materials, and understand the essence of each issue, which achieved certain results. However, in a few units, the leadership of the study was not tight enough, especially when adjusting the groups, cadres who had difficulty in studying the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" were adjusted to the intermediate group, but no necessary guidance was given, making them feel that the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" was a "hard bone" that "cannot be gnawed" or "the scope is very wide, there are many problems, and it is not easy to learn," etc.; at the same time, no attention was paid to giving necessary criticism and education to a few cadres who did not attach importance to theoretical study or had complacency and were ambitious, which affected the learning effect.
    In order to enable all cadres in the intermediate group to study Chapter Ten of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" well, the East China First-Level Organ Committee of the CPC specially issued a notice stipulating that the study progress should begin from the beginning of September to the end of October. The notice requires that the study leadership of each unit should advocate reading carefully, overcome complacency, and prevent slackness and procrastination to ensure the completion of the study plan on schedule; each unit should also, based on the experience of studying Chapter Nine of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)," promptly invite comrades from the senior group or the tutoring group to make some small tutoring reports, strengthen the leadership of the tutoring group, and ensure that the study can achieve the due effect.

    华东一级机关干部理论学习中级组
    先后开始学习“联共（布）党史”第十章
    华东一级机关干部理论学习中级组按原订计划于八月底学完了“联共（布）党史”第九章，从九月初已先后开始第十章的学习。
    “联共（布）党史”第九章的学习自六月初开始恢复。在学习期间，中级组讲师继去年学习总路线以前讲过的第一讲，分别续讲了第二、三讲。由于中级组讲师能认真备课，多数讲师讲的课，一般都反映良好。
    在学习中，大多数干部都认真学习，坚持学习制度。合作总社华东办事处、国家物资储备局华东区分局、华东民政局等单位的干部都坚持了每星期六四小时的理论学习，还利用业余时间自学。大多数单位加强了学习领导，及时检查了学习情形，领导中级组辅导员展开了各种各样的辅导活动，并请高级组干部作一些专题或小型的辅导报告等。华东局组织部和办公厅总支，在学习“联共（布）党史”第九章的三、四、五节时，组织了商业和合作社问题的两次专题报告，对大家帮助很大。华东公安局、华东财政局、中央第一机械工业部供应总局华东办事处等单位，也都能注意开展辅导活动，发挥辅导组的作用，帮助大家掌握文件中心、找参考资料、领会每个问题的精神实质，收到了一定的效果。但也有少数单位在学习中，学习领导上抓的不紧，特别是在调整小组时，将学习“联共（布）党史”有困难的干部调整到了中级组，又未能进行必要的辅导，使他们感到“联共（布）党史”是“一块骨头”“啃不动”或“面很广、问题多、不好学”等；同时对少数不重视理论学习或存在有自满情绪、好高鹜远的干部，也未注意给以必要的批评教育，影响了学习效果。
    为了使全体中级组的干部学好“联共（布）党史”第十章，中共华东一级机关委员会特发出通知，规定学习进度从九月初开始至十月底学完。通知中要求各单位学习领导上要提倡认真读书，克服自满情绪，防止松懈、拖沓现象的产生，以保证按期完成学习计划；各单位并应根据学习“联共（布）党史”第九章时的经验，及时请高级组同志或辅导小组作一些小型的辅导报告，加强辅导小组的领导，保证学习能收到应有的效果。
