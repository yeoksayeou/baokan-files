The agricultural and forestry departments of the Central People's Government and the agricultural and forestry departments of Guangdong Province, together with relevant units, have jointly formed an investigation team to investigate tropical plant resources on Hainan Island and the Leizhou Peninsula, respectively.

Hainan Island and the Leizhou Peninsula are regions in China suitable for the growth of tropical crops. According to a preliminary survey by the Guangdong Provincial Department of Agriculture, if existing conditions are used to develop four crops—sisal, coconut, pineapple, and coffee—on Hainan Island, the income of Hainan Island residents could double in six or seven years. In addition, Hainan Island is also suitable for large-scale cultivation of citronella, castor bean, cocoa, pepper, as well as oil palm, rich in oil content, and cinchona trees, from which quinine can be extracted. Hainan Island also has a large amount of forest that can be developed. In addition to being developed as a sugar industry base for planting sugarcane, the Leizhou Peninsula is more suitable for planting pineapples, sisal, abaca, and fruit trees such as oranges, mangoes, lemons, and lychees; and it has conditions for developing afforestation and animal husbandry. In the inland areas of Guangdong Province, each pineapple plant produces only one pineapple, each weighing no more than one catty. On Hainan Island, each pineapple plant can produce two or three or more, each generally reaching five or six catties. Afforestation in North China and Northeast China takes fifty or sixty years to one hundred years to become timber, while on Hainan Island and the Leizhou Peninsula, it only takes thirty or fifty years, and some even become timber in ten or eight years.

    中央和广东省农林部门联合组成调查队
    调查海南岛和雷州半岛的热带植物资源
    中央人民政府农林部门和广东省农林部门会同有关单位联合组成调查队，分别到海南岛和雷州半岛调查热带植物资源。
    海南岛和雷州半岛是我国适宜于热带作物生长的地区。据广东省农业厅初步调查：在海南岛按现有条件发展龙舌兰、椰子、菠萝、咖啡等四种作物，六、七年后海南岛居民的收入就可增加一倍。此外，海南岛也适宜于大量种植香茅、蓖麻、可可、胡椒以及含油量丰富的油椶和能提炼金鸡纳霜的规那树。海南岛还有大量森林可以开发。雷州半岛除可发展为种植甘蔗的糖业基地外，更可种植菠萝、剑麻、番麻和橙子、芒果、柠檬、荔枝等果树；并有条件发展造林和畜牧业。广东省内陆地带每棵菠萝树只生一个菠萝，每个重不过一斤多。海南岛每棵菠萝树可生两三个以上，每个一般都达五、六斤。华北、东北造林要五六十年到一百年才能成材，在海南岛和雷州半岛只要三、五十年，甚至有些十年八年就可成材。　（新华社）
