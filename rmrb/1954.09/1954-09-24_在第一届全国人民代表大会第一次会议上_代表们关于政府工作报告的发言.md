Speech by Delegate Chen Yun

Fellow Delegates:

I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report.

Now, I would like to offer some opinions on a matter of concern in people's economic life, namely the state's implementation of planned purchase and planned supply of grain and some other most important daily consumer goods.

Since 1953, there has been a phenomenon of supply falling short of demand for several kinds of daily consumer goods in our market. In the first half of 1953, the supply and demand situation for grain was very tight in areas affected by wheat frost. In the second half of the year, cooking oil and meat were also in short supply in many places, and people had to queue up to buy them in many cities and towns. To meet the needs of the time, the Central People's Government implemented planned purchase (i.e., unified purchase) and planned supply (i.e., unified sales) of grain in November 1953; then, planned purchase and planned supply of edible vegetable oil were also implemented successively; from September 15, 1954, planned purchase of cotton and planned purchase and planned supply of cotton cloth were also implemented. Planned purchase and planned supply of grain, oil, cotton, and cotton cloth is undoubtedly a major measure, which is related to the most important issues of eating and clothing for the people of the whole country, and also related to many aspects of China's urban and rural economic life. Planned purchase and planned supply is very necessary for our country's current situation. Only by adopting this method can we guarantee the increasing needs of our people's lives, can we stop speculative activities, guarantee the stability of market prices, and ensure the smooth progress of the First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy.

What are the reasons for the shortage of grain, oil, meat, and cloth? Is it because the production of these items has decreased? No, it isn't. On the contrary, since liberation, the production of grain, oil, meat, cotton, and cloth has been rising, and the production of grain, meat, cotton, and cloth has far exceeded the highest annual output before the War of Resistance Against Japan. The average annual grain output in the five years before the War of Resistance Against Japan was 280 billion jin, of which the output in 1936 was 300 billion jin, but the grain output in 1953 reached 330 billion jin. The year 1936 before the War of Resistance Against Japan was the year with the highest cotton output, with an output of more than 16 million dan, but the cotton output in 1953 had reached 23.5 million dan; 1933 was the year with the highest cotton yarn output before the war, with an output of 2.44 million pieces, while 1953 saw 4.09 million pieces. In 1936, there were 63 million pigs raised in the country, and in 1953, there were 93 million. Only oil crops are an exception. Although production has increased since liberation, it has not yet reached the highest level before the War of Resistance Against Japan. According to the above situation, it can be seen that grain, cotton, meat, and cloth have all greatly exceeded the highest levels in China's history. Taking oil as an example, the output in 1952 was higher than in 1950 and 1951. The supply and demand situation for cooking oil was stable from 1950 to 1952. But it was precisely after the output in 1952 increased compared to the previous two years that it was not enough to meet the needs of 1953. This shows that the reason for the shortage of supply is not because the output of these items has decreased, but that the shortage of supply still occurred after the output increased.

Then, is the reason for the shortage of supply because of increased exports? Does the quantity of exports exceed that before the war? In the past five years, we have exported a certain amount of grain, oil, meat, and other agricultural products. We believe this is absolutely necessary. China is an economically backward country. For more than a hundred years, it has suffered from the exploitation and oppression of imperialism. After the people have grasped state power, our important task is to change the backward state of our country's economy. That is to say, we must import a large number of machines and equipment to establish our industrial base, so that in a few years, we can transform our country into a highly industrialized country. In order to import machines and equipment, we must use export goods to exchange for them. Our country is still an agricultural country, and the main items that can be exported are agricultural products. If we cannot save agricultural products for export in terms of domestic consumption, then we will not have the main export items, that is to say, we will not be able to import machines and equipment for industrial construction. Therefore, the people of the whole country should consciously save all the consumables that can be saved in order to supply exports. In order to ensure the needs of the people, the state only allows a certain amount of grain, oil, and meat to be exported. For other agricultural products, we should try to supply exports first, and then supply domestic needs with the surplus. Reducing consumption is certainly an uncomfortable thing, but we must choose one of the two: either temporarily reduce the consumption that can be reduced in order to complete national industrialization, thereby establishing a foundation for our country to further develop agriculture and light industry, and making it possible for us to rapidly increase the output of various consumer goods in the future; or consume all of them domestically, thereby failing to build industry and keeping China's economy in a backward state for a long time. The people of the whole country should naturally choose the former, not the latter. We believe that not only now, but also in the next ten years or more, we can only adopt the method of saving domestic consumption and supplying exports first. Only when the industrial base is established and the import of industrial equipment can be reduced can this situation be changed.

Although we have exported a certain amount of grain and oil, the amount of exports is either not much more than before the war, or it has decreased. In terms of grain, the average annual export in the four years from 1950 to 1953 was 3.1 billion jin. After the "September 18th Incident," there are no reliable materials on how much grain was exported from the Northeast region each year, so it is difficult to have complete national export figures before the war. According to customs statistics, in the four years from 1927 to 1930, when there were both imports of rice and wheat and exports of soybeans and miscellaneous grains, if we calculate based on net exports after deducting imports, then the average annual net export was 2.3 billion jin. The amount of exports after liberation was 800 million jin more per year than in that period, which is not a large number in terms of the national grain output. In terms of oil exports, the average annual export in the four years from 1927 to 1930 before the war was 246,000 tons, while the average annual export in the four years after liberation was 236,000 tons, a decrease of 10,000 tons per year. Pork exports have increased slightly compared to before the war, but the amount of pork exports only accounts for 6 percent of the increased production since liberation, and a little more than 2 percent of the national pork production. Since liberation, there has been a roughly equal amount of grain, oil, and meat exported each year. The market supply and demand situation was stable from 1950 to 1952, and the phenomenon of supply falling short of demand only occurred in 1953. Therefore, the reason for the shortage of these items cannot be said to be caused by exports.

The fundamental reason for the shortage of certain consumer goods is that the rate of increase in people's purchasing power is increasingly exceeding the rate of increase in the production of these consumer goods. The output of these consumer goods has increased, but the purchasing power of the people has increased even faster. The fact that the purchasing power of farmers has increased is very obvious. They have been allocated the land of landlords, and after several years of good harvests, plus the state's purchase prices for agricultural products are much higher than in the early days of liberation, the lives of farmers have improved. Farmers who used to eat thin gruel and little food now eat more and better food; farmers who used to be forced to sell their food crops to pay rent and debts now not only do not sell food crops, but also do not need to rush to sell their surplus grain. The demand for grain in urban industrial and mining areas and rural technical crop areas is increasing rapidly, but farmers are not in a hurry to sell their surplus grain. This is the fundamental reason for the shortage of grain supply in 1953. The fact that the purchasing power of urban people has increased is also obvious. Prices have been stable in recent years, and wage income is much higher than in the early days of liberation. Most importantly, since 1953, the state has started large-scale economic construction and cultural construction, and the number of employed people in the country has greatly increased. This has greatly increased the total amount of social wages and the income of urban people. It is precisely because the income of urban and rural people has increased that the increased production of grain, oil, meat, and cloth has led to a phenomenon of supply falling short of demand. Therefore, we believe that some people's views are completely wrong. They say that before the War of Resistance, during the Kuomintang's rule, they did not adopt rationing for the above-mentioned consumer goods, but now they have adopted planned purchase and planned supply. It seems that the present is not as good as the past. The opposite is true. The output of the above-mentioned consumer goods has increased compared to before the war, but the people's purchasing power has increased faster than the increase in production. The output during the Kuomintang's rule was lower than now. The reason why there was no rationing at that time was not because of anything else, but because only warlords, bureaucrats, landlords, and capitalists had money at that time, and the living standards of hundreds of millions of working people were far inferior to what they are now. At that time, only a few people could eat their fill and dress warmly, but now hundreds of millions of liberated working people have food to eat and clothes to wear. As long as everyone in the country wears one more piece of clothing a year, they will consume 30 to 40 million more bolts of cloth a year; if they eat one more jin of meat, they will consume 6 to 7 million more pigs a year. The improvement of the consumption level of hundreds of millions of people will cause the increased production of consumer goods to fall short of demand. Can this situation be said to be "not as good as the past"? On the contrary, this precisely proves that the lives of the vast majority of people are better than in the past.

Increasing production is the fundamental way to solve the shortage of supply, but output cannot be increased significantly immediately. In the current conditions, there are two ways to solve the supply of consumer goods: one is to allow these consumer goods to be hoarded and speculated on, and to raise prices through panic buying, then the speculators will benefit, and the vast consumers will suffer. The other way is to implement planned purchase and planned supply. This method not only ensures that the owners of goods get a reasonable selling price, but also ensures that consumers buy a certain amount of consumer goods at a normal price. Therefore, it is beneficial and harmless to both the sellers of goods and the vast consumers, and only unfavorable to speculators, because they cannot engage in speculation. Therefore, our adoption of the latter method is completely correct.

Is the state's implementation of planned purchase of surplus grain, cotton, and oil from farmers outside of their own use detrimental to farmers? We believe that this is beneficial to all farmers. If the agricultural product market is not planned and purchased by the state, but is manipulated by private merchants and rich peasants, then it will be the old road before liberation. At that time, only merchants and rich peasants could wait for high prices and hoard and speculate, and the vast farmers would not get any benefit at all. On the contrary, in the market manipulated by private merchants and rich peasants, farmers can only be: pressured down when selling, and pay high prices when buying. After the state implements planned purchase, farmers will no longer suffer this loss. The brand prices stipulated by the state for planned purchase and planned supply fully take care of the interests of farmers and consumers, and are completely fair. In the past year, the state spent more than 2 trillion yuan on freight and miscellaneous expenses between grain income and sales. Where in the world can you find grain merchants who subsidize farmers and consumers? Of course, subsidizing grain losses with state treasury funds can only be a temporary phenomenon; however, this alone can prove that the state fully takes care of the interests of farmers and consumers. At the same time, more than one-third of the total amount of grain sold by the state is sold to farmers who lack grain. Farmers who buy grain from the state number more than 100 million people. They either grow technical crops, or do not have enough grain because they have little land, or they need the state to supply grain to varying degrees because they have suffered disasters. Therefore, no matter from which aspect, planned purchase of agricultural products is beneficial and harmless to farmers.

Not everyone agrees with the method of rationing flour, cotton cloth, and cooking oil. Rationing is certainly a restriction on consumption, but the rationing we currently adopt is not a comprehensive and strict rationing. In fact, only a part of the varieties in a certain type of item are rationed. For example, flour is rationed in the north, and the amount of distribution is not large, but other grains are not rationed. Cotton cloth is rationed, but the amount of supply is enough to guarantee everyone's necessary clothing. People with high purchasing power can also freely purchase silk fabrics, wool fabrics, and linen fabrics, because these fabrics are not rationed. Cooking oil is rationed, and the rationing in some cities and villages is also very low, but meat and animal oil are not rationed. Therefore, such rationing does not comprehensively restrict people's consumption. Rationing is certainly an uncomfortable thing for consumers compared to free purchase, but if merchants are allowed to hoard and speculate on, and raise prices through panic buying, then most people will not only be more uncomfortable, but many people may have no food to eat and no clothes to wear.

Will the policy of planned purchase and planned supply change in the future? We believe that the policy of planned purchase will continue to be implemented in the future and will not change. Because on the one hand, it is necessary for the state to control various sources of goods to ensure that the state carries out planned construction; on the other hand, the way to ensure that our farmers move towards a prosperous life is not to develop rural capitalism, but to move towards socialism through cooperation. Canceling planned purchase is equivalent to condoning private merchants and rich peasants to manipulate the agricultural product market, and rural capitalism will develop. Planned purchase is a socialist step that enables all farmers to be free from exploitation and to benefit.

Planned supply can only be a temporary measure. As long as the production of industry and agriculture increases, and the production of consumer goods increases to the extent that they can fully supply the needs of the market, the method of rationing should be abolished. But it should be seen that the day when planned supply of grain, oil, and cloth is canceled will not come quickly, because grain and oil are agricultural products, and the raw material for cloth is cotton, and cotton is also an agricultural product. The rate of increase in agricultural production is slow. We need to expand the output of agricultural products, and we should take many measures. One of the main measures is to reclaim wasteland and expand the area of cultivated land. But only after factories that manufacture agricultural machinery and other related industries are established can large-scale reclamation of wasteland be possible. Therefore, we cannot hope that the planned supply of grain, oil, and cloth will be canceled soon. On the contrary, in order to adapt to the supply and demand situation, there is a possibility of expanding the scope of planned supply in the next few years. We should see that planned supply is not a reduction in the amount of supply, it is a restraint in the improvement of consumption level, that is to say, our consumption level cannot be improved without limit at present, it can only be improved gradually. It should be seen that restraint in the improvement of living standards does not mean the backwardness of the national economic situation, but precisely shows the progress of the national economic situation, which is the normal state of national economic development.

The planned purchase and planned supply of grain and oil has been implemented for more than half a year. In the past period of time, it has proved that the people of the whole country are supporting the government. Farmers enthusiastically responded to the state's call for planned purchase, and grain and oil all overfulfilled the state's purchase plan. The situation of planned grain supply in urban and rural areas is stable, the people are cooperating with the government, and the state has also oversupplied urban and rural people with grain. Market prices across the country are stable. But this does not mean that the government has no mistakes and shortcomings in this aspect of work. There are many mistakes and shortcomings in the work. For example, the quantity of planned grain purchase is sometimes too much or too little for some farmers; the distribution of grain supplied to farmers is not completely appropriate; many market towns have not yet established a grain market led by the state and without the participation of private grain merchants. Because the state does not control enough cooking oil, there is very little supply of cooking oil to rural areas; oil presses in many places have not yet resumed oil extraction; all these mistakes and shortcomings require us to correct them in our work.

At present, a serious problem is that the supply of cooking oil in some rural areas is too small. Some people ask, how to solve it? Is it possible to reduce the supply in cities to increase the supply to rural areas? There are several different situations in farmers regarding the issue of cooking oil: some people have a surplus of cooking oil, some people can be self-sufficient in cooking oil, and some people do not have enough cooking oil or have none at all. Originally, rural areas could adjust themselves and exchange what they have for what they don't, but because the supply of cooking oil is tight, this adjustment has also decreased, which has further increased the difficulty of supply in rural areas. The amount of cooking oil allocated in cities is not high. Taking Beijing as an example, each person averages only ten liang per month, and many towns are even less than Beijing. Reducing the supply from cities to supply rural areas cannot solve the problem of oil shortage in rural areas. Because the amount that can be reduced in the city supply is very limited, assuming that each person reduces another one liang per month, but when distributed to rural areas, each farmer gets less than two qian. Oil crops come from rural areas. The only way to solve the problem of insufficient cooking oil in rural areas is to increase the production of oil crops. In order to achieve this goal, the government has stipulated measures requiring farmers who used to grow a large number of oil crops to continue to grow them as before, and to sell more oil crops to the state to ensure the needs of the state and urban people; requiring farmers who have not grown oil crops in the past to plant oil crops widely on the edges of their fields and on wasteland, so that every household can achieve self-sufficiency in cooking oil after the oil crops are harvested next year, and in addition, we hope that they can gradually sell a certain amount of oil crops to the state in the future. We believe that as long as the government stipulates appropriate measures, the farmers of the whole country will be able to cooperate with the government, and the situation of supply falling short of demand for cooking oil can be gradually alleviated.

In order to ensure supply and to consolidate the stability of market prices, while implementing planned purchase and planned supply of grain and oil, state-owned commerce has further expanded the scope of processing orders and unified purchase and sales for the products of private factories across the country. These measures are necessary and in line with the interests of all the people. However, after the implementation of these measures, a major change has taken place in China's original commercial relations, that is: after the state implements planned purchase or unified purchase and sales for a certain item, private wholesalers in this industry will reduce the source of goods, or have no business to do. After the state implements planned supply of grain, cooking oil, and cotton cloth, private retailers in these industries will become retailers who execute consignment and distribution business for state-owned commerce. At present, the state's policy towards them is this: for private wholesalers, those who can continue to operate will be allowed to continue to operate; those whose wholesale business needs to be handled by state-owned commerce will be entrusted to them as wholesale agents; those who can switch to other industries will be allowed to switch to other industries; in addition, employees of wholesalers who cannot operate, including those in actual positions on the capital side, if they have no other means of making a living, and they themselves are willing, after training and subject to state allocation, can be absorbed and employed by relevant state-owned companies and cooperatives in accordance with the salary and benefits of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce. For private retailers, as long as they honestly abide by the regulations of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce, state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce will entrust them to sell and distribute as much as possible. They can also get reasonable business income. However, anyone who does not comply with the regulations on consignment and distribution and commits theft and fraud will be given the punishment they deserve by the state.

That is my opinion on planned purchase and planned supply. I hope the delegates will give me their advice on whether it is appropriate.

Speech by Delegate Guo Moruo

Chairman, Fellow Delegates:

The First Session of the First National People's Congress of our country is a meeting of great historical significance. We have passed the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and other important laws, and the people of the whole country are rejoicing at the achievements of this meeting. Please allow me to first warmly congratulate the success of the conference!

I fully agree with the Government Work Report made by Premier Zhou Enlai. I would now like to make some supplementary explanations on the situation of cultural and educational work for the reference of the conference.

In the past five years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, the people of our country have been implementing the various policies of the Common Program, uniting as one, working hard, and have achieved new and great victories not only in politics and economy, but also in culture and education.

During these five years, in coordination with various social reforms, the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, economic recovery work, and the progress of large-scale economic construction, we have carried out arduous restoration and reform work in various cultural and educational undertakings, and have made great progress. We have launched ideological remolding movements among the vast number of intellectuals in the country, and promoted the unity and progress of the intellectual circles. We have conducted extensive and in-depth patriotic and internationalist propaganda and education among the people of the whole country, and raised the political consciousness of the people. Now, the 600 million people of our country have further realized the correctness of the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party from their own personal experience, gradually gotten rid of the influence left over from the old society, expressed their common determination to build a socialist society, and are determined to work tirelessly for the lofty goal of maintaining world peace and promoting human progress. This political and ideological unity of the people of our country is the source of the inexhaustible power for the socialist construction of our great motherland.

In the past five years, the development and progress of various cultural and educational undertakings have been very rapid. Please allow me to compare the current situation of various cultural and educational undertakings with the situation in the old China before liberation. At the end of 1953, there were more than 216,000 students in colleges and universities in our country, an increase of 40 percent over before liberation; 669,000 students in secondary vocational schools, an increase of 75 percent over before liberation; 2.93 million students in middle schools, an increase of 96 percent over before liberation; and 51.5 million students in primary schools, an increase of 117 percent over before liberation. Other items such as the number of medical beds, the number of film projection units, the number of published books and textbooks, the number of newspapers and magazines issued, etc., have all greatly exceeded the highest levels before liberation. Various cultural and educational undertakings have not only greatly increased in quantity, but have also greatly improved in quality. In the old China, the reactionaries did not allow the working people to enjoy culture and education; the new China of people's democracy is working hard to promote the working people to learn culture and receive education. Now, children of workers and peasants account for more than 80 percent of primary school students, 58 percent of middle school students, and the proportion of children of workers and peasants in colleges and universities is also increasing year by year. In order to train new-type worker-peasant intellectuals, the state has also specially established worker-peasant rapid middle schools and the Renmin University of China, and has vigorously promoted spare-time cultural education for worker-peasant cadres. In the old China, the reactionaries adopted a policy of contempt and destruction towards the culture of various ethnic minorities, and even denied the existence of various ethnic minorities; the new China of people's democracy is working hard to develop the culture of various ethnic minorities. In recent years, the education, health, culture, and art undertakings in various ethnic minority areas have made great progress, and the population has been significantly increasing in some places where the population used to decline rapidly. In the old China, the reactionaries single-mindedly promoted the worship of imperialism, spread slave ideology, and did not pay attention to the cultural heritage of the motherland at all; the new China of people's democracy attaches importance to sorting out, researching, and promoting the rich cultural heritage of the motherland in all aspects, and at the same time strives to learn the advanced culture of the Soviet Union and other countries, integrates them, and constantly improves and improves various cultural and educational undertakings in order to better serve the cause of national construction. These achievements all demonstrate the superiority of our country's people's democratic system, and also mark the new victory of Marxism-Leninism.

We should value these achievements. These achievements have laid a good foundation for the construction of our country's cultural and educational undertakings in the future. However, we must not have the slightest exaggeration or complacency. We know that our work is still far from keeping up with the objective needs. The development of various cultural and educational undertakings is still far from meeting the needs of national construction, especially industrial construction, and is still far from meeting the ever-increasing cultural demands of the masses of the people. The quality of some of our work is not high, and some is even very poor. In our leadership work, there are still problems of bureaucracy, subjectivism, and decentralism. It is not enough to conduct in-depth inspections and provide specific guidance to the work below, so shortcomings and errors in the implementation of policies often occur in actual work.

Please allow me to give an example. Recently, we have focused on inspecting and criticizing the error of neglecting labor education in school education. Many students, after graduation, are unwilling to participate in industrial and agricultural production, despise manual labor, and even look down on workers, peasants, and working people. This is a very bad trend. But can we blame the young students? I don't think we can. This must be the responsibility of our education departments. We usually do not educate students well, and do not let them know that labor production is the most glorious and most basic thing, and that workers, peasants, and working people are the foundation of our country. We usually do not educate students well, and do not let them know that we must build a beautiful and happy socialist and communist society, and everyone must participate in arduous struggles and must engage in hard work. We usually do not educate students well, and do not let them know that the idea of ​​despising labor and despising working people is the extremely shameful idea of ​​the exploiting classes. This error must be strictly corrected. Our schools at all levels must focus on and correctly carry out labor education in the future to cultivate the socialist labor attitude of children and young people. Of course, family education and social education have a great influence on children and young people. We should also cooperate in many aspects to carry out this kind of education for children and young people, so that we can achieve good results.

Please allow me to give another example. We have also recently focused on inspecting and criticizing the error of underestimating and discriminating against traditional Chinese medicine in health work. As everyone knows, China's medical knowledge has a history of thousands of years. It is the accumulation of practical experience of our people in effectively fighting against diseases and injuries in the long ages. It has made a great contribution to the survival and development of various ethnic groups in China. There is no doubt that China's inherent medical knowledge is a very valuable cultural heritage of our great motherland. Until now, it still has great practical value and scientific research value. It has long attracted the attention of many foreign medical scientists. However, for several years, we have neglected this aspect of work. Some responsible comrades in the health department even believe that traditional Chinese medicine is backward, is "feudal medicine," and should be eliminated and eliminated. Therefore, in actual work, they have adopted an attitude of underestimation, discrimination, and even exclusion towards traditional Chinese medicine. This erroneous thinking and practice has greatly affected the research and development of our country's medical heritage, affected the unity of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, and affected the development of the entire people's health care cause. This is an error with a directional nature. In the future, we must work hard to correct this error, correct our understanding of Chinese medical culture, correctly implement the policy of uniting traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, call on and organize traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine to learn from each other, learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses, and make greater contributions to the people's health care cause.

Our various cultural and educational undertakings are developing forward on an unprecedented scale, and our experience is very limited. Shortcomings and errors are difficult to completely avoid. But we will never cover up the shortcomings and errors in our work, but will adopt the method of carrying out criticism and self-criticism to overcome and correct these shortcomings and errors. For comrades who have shortcomings and errors in their work, we are implementing the principle of "starting from unity, reaching the goal of unity through criticism and self-criticism" instructed by Chairman Mao, in order to improve our work and improve our cadres. We have achieved very good results by doing this.

In the future, the tasks of our cultural and educational departments will be even heavier and more arduous. If we want to gradually realize the general task of the country during the transition period and the basic tasks of the First Five-Year Plan, we must continue to develop and improve various cultural and educational undertakings on the basis of existing work, vigorously train various talents necessary for national construction, especially scientific and technological talents and management talents related to industrial construction, and actively increase the people's health and improve the people's socialist awareness and cultural level, so as to ensure the victorious advancement of the national construction cause.

In all cultural and educational work, we must implement the principle of educating the people with socialist ideology. We must combine the major tasks of each period to educate and encourage the people of the whole country, obey the national plan, work hard, constantly improve labor productivity, and strive to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance and the people's democratic system in order to promote the cause of socialist construction. At the same time, we must also pay special attention to promoting the patriotism and internationalism of the people of our country, resolutely oppose the US imperialism's occupation of our country's territory, resolutely realize the historical task of liberating Taiwan and eliminating the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique, so as to complete our country's sacred cause of liberation, and make unremitting efforts to defend peace in Asia and the world.

Fellow Delegates! The First Session of the First National People's Congress will soon produce new state organs in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. All of us cultural and educational workers must unite more closely, strive to abide by the Constitution and various laws of the country, strive to study Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works, strive to absorb the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, combine theory with practice, and work diligently. We must continue to implement ideological remolding, improve political awareness, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and promote the style of close ties with the masses of the people and hard work in order to gradually complete the historical task of the socialist construction of our great motherland.

Fellow Delegates! Our country has the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and the united struggle of the people of the whole country. We will be victorious in everything we do. Let each of us work a hundred times harder and contribute our best labor to our great motherland!

Speech by Delegate Cheng Qian

Chairman, Fellow Delegates:

I am very excited to be able to participate in this First Session of the First National People's Congress, which represents the 600 million people in exercising state power.

Our meeting has completed the solemn task of passing the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and the five organizational laws. This is a big thing, and this big thing will be written in the history of our country and will always radiate brilliance. Our meeting today heard Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report. This report summarized the work of the past five years and pointed out the direction and tasks for the future. I fully agree with and support this report, and I approve the resolution of the conference on the Government Work Report. Five years is a very short time in the long history of the development of our great nation; but in these five years, our country has undergone tremendous changes and has made miraculous progress. The people of our country and our international friends are rejoicing at the progress of our country, and the people of our country are therefore more confident and are moving firmly towards the goal of socialism.

"Criticism and self-criticism is a very important manifestation of our democratic life." In this regard, our meeting should have a good start. In this spirit, I would like to put forward two personal opinions at the conference:

First, in the past few years, I have attended many meetings in the central government and participated in the formulation of many major national policies and laws; at the same time, I have also held a position in the state administrative organs in Hunan. In the actual work in the central government and the local government, I have a very deep understanding, that is: the main reason why we have achieved such great results is because we rely on unity, rely on the unity of the working people, rely on the unity of the Communist Party and non-Party people, rely on the unity of people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life. In the process of carrying out unity work, the Communist Party has played a core and major role. The Communist Party's excellent style of being selfless and objective, seeking truth from facts, and conducting work through democratic consultation with non-Party people has become a visible fact and a well-known reputation. However, the method of the Party's leadership over the government, as well as the actual work of the Party's unity and cooperation with non-Party people, cannot be said to be perfect. The Communist Party is the leading core of our country's affairs. This point is absolutely unshakable; the Communist Party's decisions are implemented through the government, which is also undeniable. This is what we did in Hunan as well. Here, the Communist Party is like a nerve center, realizing the Communist Party's decisions through the government, people's organizations, and the entire masses, just like "the body uses the arm, and the arm uses the finger." It must be that the Qi and blood flow smoothly, and the meridians are connected, in order to achieve the effect of being handy. If my analogy is appropriate, I feel that: in some work, the Qi and blood meridians are still not flexible in response; the Party's leadership over the government and the Party's unity and cooperation with non-Party people have not yet reached the realm of principled integration. This is the fly in the ointment. Of course, from my personal point of view, my initiative in work is also insufficient. I often neglect to think that certain issues are not important and do not need to be verbose. In fact, considering the interests of the work, from the perspective of further consolidating unity, and from the true feelings of supporting and loving the Communist Party, I have not completely fulfilled my responsibilities in the past, and have not completely achieved "knowing everything and saying everything without reservation," which is wrong. Therefore, I should express the above sincere words, hoping that the Communist Party will pay attention to improving the leadership methods of the government, strengthen ideological leadership, establish a scientific division of labor and responsibility system, so as to further strengthen the Party's unity and cooperation with non-Party people, and further give play to the talents and enthusiasm of all state employees, and work hard for the common cause of building a socialist society.

Second, in the past few years, the various ministries of the central government have guided the provinces in their business scope to do a lot of work and have achieved significant results. However, some departments of the central government are often too rigid and inflexible when issuing orders and instructions, which makes it difficult for the lower levels to do things, and encourages the commandism and the "five excesses" phenomenon

    在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上
    代表们关于政府工作报告的发言
    陈云代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意周恩来总理的政府工作报告。
    现在我就目前人民经济生活中大家关心的一个问题，就是国家对于粮食和其他一些最重要的日用消费品实行计划收购和计划供应的问题，发表一些意见。
    从一九五三年以来，我国市场上出现了若干种日用消费品供不应求的现象。一九五三年上半年，在小麦遭受冻灾的地区，粮食的供求状况很紧张，下半年，食油、肉类在许多地方也供不应求，不少城镇中都要排队购买。适应当时的需要，中央人民政府在一九五三年十一月，对粮食实行了计划收购（即统购）和计划供应（即统销）；然后对食用植物油也先后实行了计划收购和计划供应；从一九五四年九月十五日起，又对棉花实行计划收购，对棉布实行计划收购和计划供应。对粮食、油料、棉花、棉布的计划收购和计划供应无疑是一种重大的措施，它关联到全国人民生活中最重要的吃饭和穿衣的问题，也关联到我国城乡经济生活的许多方面。计划收购和计划供应对我们国家目前的情况来说，是很必要的，只有采用这种办法，才能保证我国人民生活日益增长的需要，才能制止投机活动，保证市场物价的稳定，才能使发展国民经济的第一个五年计划得以顺利地进行。
    粮食、油料、肉类、布匹供不应求的原因是什么？是不是这些物品的生产量减少了？不是的。正相反，解放以来，粮食、油料、肉类、棉花、布匹的生产量都是上升的，而且粮食、肉类、棉花、布匹远远超过了抗日战争以前的最高年产量。抗日战争前五年的粮食平均年产量是二千八百亿斤，其中一九三六年产量是三千亿斤，可是一九五三年的粮食产量达到了三千三百亿斤。抗日战争前一九三六年是产棉量最高的一年，那一年的产量是一千六百多万担，可是一九五三年棉花产量已经达到二千三百五十万担；一九三三年是棉纱产量最高的一年，产量是二百四十四万件，一九五三年是四百零九万件。一九三六年全国养猪六千三百万头，一九五三年就达到九千三百万头。只有油料作物是例外，虽然解放以来是增产的，但是还没有达到抗日战争前的最高水平。根据上述情况可以看出，粮食、棉花、肉类、布匹都已经大大超过了我国历史上的最高水平。就拿油料来说，一九五二年的产量高于一九五○年和一九五一年，一九五○年到一九五二年食油供求情况是平稳的。但恰恰是一九五二年的产量比前两年提高以后，反而不够供应一九五三年的需要。这就可以看出供不应求的原因，不是因为这些物品的产量减低，是在产量增加以后，仍然发生供不应求的现象。
    那么，供不应求的原因，是否因为出口多了？是否出口的数量超过了战前？五年来，我们是有一定数量的粮食、油料、肉类和其他农产品出口的。我们认为这是完全必要的。我国是一个经济落后的国家，一百多年来受尽了帝国主义的剥削和压迫，人民掌握了国家政权以后，我们的重要任务，就是要改变我们国家经济的落后状态。这就是说，我们必须进口大量的机器装备，来建立我们的工业基础，以便在若干年以后，把我国改造成为一个高度工业化的国家。为了进口机器装备，我们必须用出口物资去交换。我国现在还是一个农业国家，能够出口的主要物品是农产品。如果在国内消费方面，不能节省出农产品去出口，那么，我们就没有主要的出口物品，也就是说，我们不可能进口机器装备来进行工业建设。因此，全国人民应该自觉地节省凡属可以节省的消费品，以便供应出口。为了保证人民的需要，国家对于粮食、油料、肉类只准许一定数量的出口，对于其他农产品，那是应该尽可能首先供应出口，出口有余，再来供应国内需要。减少消费，当然是一件不舒服的事情，但是我们必须在两者中间选择一个：或者是暂时减少可以减少的消费，以便完成国家工业化，由此来建立我国能够进一步地发展农业和轻工业的基础，而使我们有可能在将来迅速地增加各种消费品的产量；或者是尽其所有在国内消费掉，因而不能建设工业，使我国经济长期处于落后状态。全国人民自然应该选择前者，不要后者。我们以为，不但是现在，而且是今后十多年内，我们只能采取节省国内消费、首先供应出口的办法，只有工业基础建立以后，工业装备的进口可以减少的时候，这种情况才能有所改变。
    我们虽然出口了一定数量的粮食、油料，但是现在比战前出口的数量或是超过不多，或是还有减少。粮食方面，一九五○年到一九五三的四年中，平均每年出口三十一亿斤。“九一八”事变以后，东北地区每年出口多少粮食没有确实材料，因此就难有战前的完整的全国出口数字。根据海关的统计，一九二七年到一九三○年的四年中，那时既有大米、小麦进口，也有大豆、杂粮出口，如果拿扣除进口的净出口来计算，那么平均每年净出口是二十三亿斤。解放以后的出口量，比那一时期每年多了八亿斤，从全国粮食产量来说，这并不是一个大的数目。油的出口，战前一九二七年到一九三○年四年中，平均每年出口二十四万六千吨，解放以后四年中，平均每年出口二十三万六千吨，每年出口还减少一万吨。猪肉出口比战前略有增加，但是猪肉出口数量只占解放以来增产数量的百分之六，占全国猪的产量的百分之二多一点。解放以来，粮食、油料、肉类每年都有大体相等数量的出口，一九五○年到一九五二年市场供求情况是平稳的，到一九五三年才发生供不应求的现象，因此，这些物品供不应求的原因，不能说是由于出口所造成的。
    若干消费品供不应求的根本原因，是因为人民购买力增长的速度日益超过这些消费品生产增长的速度。这些消费品的产量是增加了，但是人民购买力增加得更快。农民购买力提高的事实是很明显的，他们分得了地主的土地，几年的丰收，加上国家对于农产品的收购价格比起解放初期来已经有了很大的提高，因此农民的生活是改善了。过去吃得稀、吃得少的农民，现在吃得干、吃得多了；过去为了交租还债、被迫出卖口粮的农民，现在不但不卖口粮，而且无需急于出卖余粮了。城市工矿区和农村技术作物区的粮食需要量增加得很快，但是农民不急于出卖他们的余粮，这是一九五三年发生粮食供不应求的根本原因。城市人民购买力提高的事实也是明显的。几年来物价是稳定的，工资收入比起解放初期来已经有了很大的提高。最重要的是从一九五三年起，国家开始了规模巨大的经济建设和文化建设，全国就业人数又大为增加。这样，就大大增加了社会工资总量和城市人民的收入。正是由于城乡人民的收入增加了，才使产量增加了的粮食、油料、肉类、布匹发生了供不应求的现象。所以我们认为，有些人的看法是完全错误的。他们说，抗战以前国民党统治时期，对于上述几种消费品没有采取配给办法，现在反而采取计划收购和计划供应了，看来，现在不如过去了。事实正相反，上述几种消费品，比战前产量增加了，但是人民的购买力比生产增加得更快。国民党统治时期产量比现在低，当时不用配给，原因不是别的，就是因为那时只有军阀、官僚、地主、资本家有钱，几万万劳动人民的生活水平远远不如现在。那时是少数人能够吃饱、穿暖，现在是几万万翻身了的劳动人民都有饭吃都有衣穿。只要全国每一个人一年多穿一件衣服，一年就要多消费三千万到四千万匹布；多吃一斤肉，一年就要多消费六百万到七百万头猪；几万万人的消费水平提高，就会使增产了的消费品发生供不应求。这种情况难道可以说“现在不如过去”吗？正相反，这恰恰是证明了绝大多数人民的生活比过去好了。
    增加生产是解决供不应求的根本办法，但是产量是不能立刻大量增加的。就现在条件来说，解决消费品供应的办法有两种：一种是听任这些消费品被囤积居奇，抢购涨价，那么，得到好处的将是投机商人，吃亏的是广大的消费者。另一种办法是实行计划收购和计划供应。这种办法，既保证商品所有者得到了合理的出卖价格，也保证消费者用正常的价格买到一定数量的消费品。因此，无论对于商品出卖者或广大消费者都是有利无害的，仅仅对于投机者不利，因为他们无法投机倒把了。因此，我们采取后一种办法是完全正确的。
    国家对于农民自用以外的剩余粮食、棉花、油料实行计划收购，是否不利于农民？我们认为，这对于全体农民是有利的。如果不是由国家计划收购而听任私商、富农操纵农产品市场，那就是走解放以前的老路。那时能够等待高价、囤积居奇的只是商人和富农，广大的农民是得不到丝毫好处的。正相反，在私商、富农操纵的市场上，农民只能是：出卖时被压价，买进时出高价。国家实行计划收购以后，农民就再不吃这种亏了。国家规定的计划收购和计划供应的牌价，是充分照顾了农民和消费者的利益的，是完全公道的。过去一年，国家在粮食收入和卖出之间，用于运费、杂费的赔贴，就有两万多亿元，世界上到那里去找补贴农民和消费者的粮食商人？当然以国库补贴粮食的赔损，只能是暂时的现象；但是，仅仅这件事，就可以证明国家充分照顾了农民和消费者的利益。同时，国家卖出粮食的总数中，有三分之一以上是卖给缺粮的农民的。向国家买粮的农民，有一亿人口以上，他们或者因为种了技术作物，或者因为土地少粮食不够吃，或者因为受了灾，都在不同程度上需要国家供应粮食。因此无论从那一方面说，农产品的计划收购，对于农民是有利无害的。
    面粉、棉布、食油采取定量分配的办法，并不是所有的人都赞成的。定量分配，当然是对于消费的一种限制，但是我们目前采用的定量分配，还不是一种全面的严格的定量分配，实际上只是某类物品中，一部分品种实行定量分配。例如北方的面粉是定量分配的，分配量也不多，但是其他粮种并未定量分配。棉布是定量分配的，但是供应的数量足够保证每个人必要的衣着。购买力高的人，还可以自由购买丝织品、毛织品、麻织品，因为这些织物并未实行定量分配。食油是定量分配的，对某些城市和乡村的定量也很低，但是肉类和动物油并未定量分配。所以，这样的定量分配，并未全面限制人民的消费。定量分配比之自由购买，对消费者来说当然是一件不舒服的事，但是如果听任商人囤积居奇，抢购涨价，那么大多数人民不但要更加不舒服，而且许多人可能没有粮食吃，没有衣服穿。
    计划收购和计划供应的政策，将来是否会有改变？我们认为计划收购这个政策，今后要继续实行下去，是不会变更的。因为一方面由国家掌握各种货源是保证国家进行有计划建设所必需；另一方面，保证我国农民走向富裕生活的道路，不是发展农村的资本主义，而是经过合作化走向社会主义。取消计划收购，等于放纵私商和富农去操纵农产品市场，农村的资本主义就会发展。计划收购是一种使全体农民不受人剥削、都能得到利益的社会主义的步骤。
    计划供应只能是一种暂时的措施，只要工业和农业的生产增加了，消费品的生产增加到可以充分供应市场需要的程度，定量分配的办法就应该取消。但是应该看到，取消粮食、油料、布匹计划供应的日子，并不会很快到来，因为粮食、油料是农产品，布匹的原料是棉花，棉花也是农产品，农产品增产的速度是缓慢的。我们要扩大农产品的产量，应该采取许多办法，其中一个主要的办法，是开垦荒地，扩大耕地面积。但是只有制造农业机器的工厂和其他有关的工业建立起来以后，大规模地开垦荒地，才有可能。因此，我们便不能希望粮食、油料、布匹的计划供应，会很快取消。相反的，为了适应供求情况，今后几年内还有扩大计划供应范围的可能。我们应该看到，计划供应并不是供应数量的减少，它是消费水平提高中的节制，就是说我们的消费水平在目前不能无限制的提高，只能是逐步的提高。应该看到对生活水平提高中的节制，并不表示国家经济状况的后退，正是显示出国家经济状况的前进，这是国家经济发展的正常状态。
    粮食、油料的计划收购和计划供应，已经实行了半年多。在过去这段时间内，证明了全国人民是赞助政府的。农民热烈响应了国家计划收购的号召，粮食、油料都超额完成了国家的收购计划。城乡粮食计划供应的情况是平稳的，人民同政府是合作的，国家在粮食方面也超额供应了城乡人民。全国的市场物价是平稳的。但是这并不是说，政府在这一方面的工作没有错误和缺点，工作中错误和缺点是很多的。例如，粮食计划收购的数量，对某些农户有偏多偏少的现象；对供应农民的粮食分配，并不完全恰当；许多集镇尚未建立起国家领导的、没有私营粮商参加的粮食市场。由于国家没有掌握足够的食油，因此对农村食油供应就很少；许多地方的油榨坊尚未恢复榨油；所有这些错误和缺点，都要求我们在工作中加以改正。
    目前一个严重问题是某些农村食油供应量太少。有人问，如何解决？可否减少城市中的供应量来增加到农村去？关于食油问题在农民中有几种不同的情况：有一部分人食油是有余的，有一部分人食油能够自给，有一部分人食油不够自给或者根本没有。农村中本来可以自行调剂，互通有无的，因为食油供应紧张了，这种调剂也减少了，这就更增加农村供应的困难。城市中食油分配的定量是不高的。以北京为例，每人每月平均不过十两，许多城镇还比北京少。从城市中减少供应量来供应农村，并不能解决农村的缺油问题。因为城市供应数量中能够减少的很有限，假定每个人每个月再减少一两，但是分到农村去，每个农民分得的还不到二钱。油料是从农村来的，解决农村食油不足的唯一办法，是增加油料的产量。为了达到这个目的，政府已经规定办法，要求过去大量种植油料作物的农户，必须照旧种植，而且要以更多的油料卖给国家，保证国家和城市人民的需要；要求过去未种油料作物的农户，家家户户必须在地边上、荒地上广种油料作物，到明年油料收获以后，保证家家都能达到食油自给，除此以外，并且希望以后能够逐步做到拿出一定数量的油料卖给国家。我们相信，只要政府规定出适当的办法，全国农民是能够同政府合作的，食油供不应求的情况是可以逐渐缓和的。
    为了保障供应，为了巩固市场物价的稳定，在实行粮食、油料计划收购和计划供应的同时，国营商业对全国私营工厂的产品更进一步扩大了加工订货和统购包销的范围，这些措施是必要的，符合于全体人民的利益的。但是，实行这些措施以后，在我国原有的商业关系中发生了一个重大的变化，这就是：国家对于某一种物品实行计划收购或者统购包销以后，这一行业的私营批发商，就减少了货源，或者没有买卖可做。国家实行粮食、食油、棉布的计划供应以后，这些行业的私营零售商，就变成替国营商业执行代销、经销业务的零售商。目前国家对他们的政策是这样：对于私营批发商，他们能够继续经营的让他们继续经营；国营商业需要他们代理批发业务的，委托他们代理批发；能够转业的让他们转业；除此以外，无法经营的批发商从业人员，连同资方实职人员在内，如果他们没有别的谋生之路，他们自己又愿意，经过训练，服从国家调配，可以由有关的国营公司和合作社依照国营商业和合作社商业的工薪待遇，吸收录用。对于私营零售商，只要他们诚实地遵守国营商业和合作社商业的规定，国营商业和合作社商业将尽可能地委托他们代销、经销。他们也可以得到合理的营业收入。但是凡属不遵守代销、经销的规定，犯有盗窃舞弊行为的人，国家将给以应得的处罚。
    我对于计划收购、计划供应的意见就是这样，是否妥当，希望各位代表指教。
    郭沫若代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我国第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议是一个有伟大历史意义的会议。我们已经通过了中华人民共和国宪法和其他重要的法律，全国人民都在为这次会议的成就而欢欣鼓舞。请允许我首先热烈地祝贺大会的成功！
    我完全同意周恩来总理所作的政府工作的报告。我现在谨就文化教育工作的情况，作一些补充说明，供大会参考。
    五年来，我国人民在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的领导下，执行着共同纲领的各项政策，团结一致，艰苦奋斗，不仅在政治上、经济上取得了新的伟大的胜利，在文化教育方面也获得了巨大的成就。
    在这五年中间，我们配合着各项社会改革、抗美援朝斗争、经济恢复工作以及大规模的经济建设的进展，对各项文化教育事业进行了艰巨的恢复和改革的工作，并且有了很大的发展。我们在全国广大知识分子中，开展了思想改造运动，推动了知识界的团结和进步。我们在全国人民中进行了广泛而深入的爱国主义和国际主义的宣传教育工作，提高了人民的政治觉悟。现在，我国六亿人民，都从亲身体验中，进一步认识到中国共产党领导的正确，逐步摆脱着旧社会遗留的影响，表示了建设社会主义社会的共同决心，并坚定地为维护世界和平和促进人类进步的崇高目的而作不懈的奋斗。我国人民这种在政治上和思想上的团结一致，是我们伟大祖国进行社会主义建设的无穷无尽的力量的源泉。
    五年来，各项文化教育事业的发展和进步，都是很快的。请允许我把目前各项文教事业的状况，同解放前旧中国时代的状况作一番比较。在一九五三年年底，我国高等学校在校学生有二十一万六千多人，比解放前增长了百分之四十；中等专业学校在校学生六十六万九千人，比解放前增长了百分之七十五；中学在校学生二百九十三万人，比解放前增长了百分之九十六；小学在校学生五千一百五十万人，比解放前增长了百分之一百一十七。其他如医疗病床数、电影放映单位数、图书课本出版数、报纸杂志发行数等等，也都大大地超过了解放前的最高水平。各项文化教育事业，不仅在数量上有了很大的增加，在质量上也有很大的改进。在旧中国，反动派是不让劳动人民享有文化教育的；人民民主的新中国则是努力提倡劳动人民学文化、受教育。现在，小学学生中工农子女已占百分之八十以上，中学学生中工农子女占百分之五十八，高等学校中工农子女也在逐年增加。国家为了培养新型的工农知识分子，还特别创办了工农速成中学和中国人民大学，并且大力推行工农干部的业余文化教育。在旧中国，反动派对各少数民族的文化，采取了蔑视和摧残的政策，甚至否认各少数民族的存在；人民民主的新中国则是努力发展各少数民族的文化。几年来，各少数民族地区的教育事业、卫生事业、文化艺术事业都有很大的发展，有些过去人口急速减少的地方，现在人口已在显著地增加。在旧中国，反动派是一味提倡崇拜帝国主义，传布奴化思想，根本不注意祖国的文化遗产的；人民民主的新中国则是在各个方面都重视整理、研究和发扬祖国丰富的文化遗产，同时努力学习苏联和其他国家的先进文化，加以融会贯通，不断地改进和提高各项文化教育事业，以便更好地为国家建设事业服务。这些成就，都表现了我国人民民主制度的优越性，也标志着马克思列宁主义思想的新的胜利。
    我们应当重视这些成就。这些成就，已经为今后我国文化教育事业的建设，打下了良好的基础。但是，我们决不能有丝毫的浮夸和骄傲自满的情绪。我们知道，我们的工作还远远赶不上客观的需要。各项文化教育事业的发展，还远远不能适应国家建设特别是工业建设的需要，还远远不能满足人民大众日益增长的文化要求。我们有些工作的质量还不高，有的甚至还很差。在我们的领导工作中，也还存在着官僚主义、主观主义和分散主义的毛病，深入检查工作和给下面工作以具体指导做得很不够，因而在实际工作中常常发生执行政策上的缺点和错误。
    请允许我举一个例子来说吧。最近我们曾经着重检查和批判了学校教育中忽视劳动教育的错误。有许多学生，毕业以后，不愿参加工农业生产，轻视体力劳动，甚至还瞧不起工农劳动人民。这是很不好的倾向。但是我们能够责备青年学生么？我想是不能够的。这须得由我们的教育部门来负责。我们平时没有很好地教育学生，没有让他们知道：劳动生产是最光荣、最基本的事情，工农劳动人民是我们国家的基础。我们平时没有很好地教育学生，没有让他们知道：我们要建设美好的幸福的社会主义和共产主义社会，每一个人都必须参加艰苦的斗争，都必须进行辛勤的劳动。我们平时没有很好地教育学生，没有让他们知道：那种轻视劳动和轻视劳动人民的思想是极端可耻的剥削阶级的思想。这个错误必须严格地加以纠正。我们的各级学校今后必须着重地并且正确地进行劳动教育，以培养儿童和青年的社会主义的劳动态度。当然，家庭教育和社会教育对儿童和青年人是有很大的影响的，我们也应当多方面配合，对儿童和青年进行这种教育，这样才能收到很好的效果。
    请允许我再举一个例子来说吧。我们最近也曾经着重检查和批判了卫生工作中轻视和歧视中医的错误。大家知道，中国的医药知识有几千年的历史，它是我国人民在长久的年代中有效地同疾病和创伤作斗争的实践经验的积累，它对于中国各民族的生存和发展有巨大的贡献。毫无疑问，我国固有的医药知识，是我们伟大祖国的一份很可宝贵的文化遗产，直到现在它仍然有很大的实用价值和科学研究的价值，它早已引起了许多外国医学家的注意。但是，几年以来我们却忽视了这一方面的工作，在卫生部门中某些负责同志甚至认为中医落后，是“封建医”，应该淘汰和消灭，因而在实际工作中对于中医采取了轻视、歧视甚至排斥的态度。这种错误的思想和作法，极大地影响了对我国医药遗产的研究和发扬，影响了中医和西医的团结，影响了整个人民保健事业的发展。这是一个带有方针性的错误。今后，我们必须努力纠正这个错误，端正对中国医药文化的认识，正确地执行团结中西医的政策，号召和组织中西医相互学习，取长补短，共同进步，为人民的保健事业作出更大的贡献。
    我们的各项文化教育事业都以空前未有的规模在向前发展中，而我们的经验却是十分有限，缺点和错误是难于完全避免的。但我们决不掩饰工作中的缺点和错误，而是采取开展批评与自我批评的方法来克服和纠正这些缺点和错误。对于在工作中有缺点和错误的工作同志，我们是执行毛主席所指示的“从团结出发，经过批评和自我批评，达到团结的目的”的方针，以达到改进工作，提高干部的目的。我们这样作是收到了很好的效果的。
    今后，我们文化教育部门的任务，将要更加繁重，更加艰巨。我们要逐步实现国家在过渡时期的总任务和第一个五年计划的基本任务，我们就必须在现有工作的基础上，继续发展和改进各项文化教育事业，大力培养国家建设所必需的各项人材，特别是有关工业建设的科学技术人材和管理人材，并积极地增进人民的健康，提高人民的社会主义觉悟和文化水平，以保障国家建设事业的胜利前进。
    在各项文化教育工作中，都必须贯彻以社会主义思想教育人民的原则。我们要结合每个时期的重大工作，教育和鼓舞全国人民，服从国家计划，辛勤劳动，不断提高劳动生产率，努力巩固工农联盟，巩固人民民主制度，以推进社会主义建设事业。同时，我们还要特别注意发扬我国人民的爱国主义和国际主义的精神，坚决反对美帝国主义侵占我国领土，坚决实现解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团的历史任务，以完成我国神圣的解放事业，并为保卫亚洲和世界的和平而作不懈的斗争。
    各位代表同志们！第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议不久就要根据宪法的规定产生出新的国家机关了。我们全体文化教育工作者，一定要更加紧密地团结起来，努力遵守宪法和国家的各项法律，努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛主席的著作，努力吸取苏联和各兄弟国家的先进经验，结合实际，勤勉工作。我们要继续贯彻思想改造，提高政治觉悟，开展批评和自我批评，发扬密切联系人民群众和艰苦奋斗的作风，以逐步完成我们伟大祖国的社会主义建设的历史任务。
    各位代表同志们！我们的国家有中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导，有全国人民的团结奋斗，我们是无往而不胜利的。让我们每一个人都百倍地努力，把我们最好的劳动贡献给我们伟大的祖国吧！
    程潜代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我能够参加这次代表六亿人民行使国家权力的第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，感到十分兴奋。
    我们的会议已经完成了通过中华人民共和国宪法和五个组织法的庄严任务。这是一件大事情，这件大事情会要写在我们国家的历史上，永远放射光彩。我们的会议今天听到了周恩来总理的政府工作报告，这个报告总结了五年的工作，并且指出了今后的方针任务。我完全同意和拥护这个报告，并赞成大会通过关于政府工作报告的决议。五年，在我们伟大民族发展的悠久历史上，应该说是很短的时间；但是在这五年中，我们国家却发生了巨大的变化，出现了奇迹似的进步。我国人民和我们的国际朋友，都为我们国家的进步而欢欣鼓舞，我国人民更因此而增强了信心，坚定不移地向着社会主义的目标前进。
      “批评和自我批评是我们民主生活的一种极重要的表现”，在这方面，我们这次会议应该有一个良好的开端。本此精神，我想在大会上提出个人的两点意见：
    第一、这几年，我在中央开了许多会，参加了许多重大的国家政策法令的制定；同时，我在湖南又担任了国家行政机关的工作。在中央和地方的实际工作当中，我有一个很深刻的体会，这就是：我们之所以取得这么重大的成绩，主要是依靠了团结，依靠了劳动人民的团结，依靠了共产党和党外人士的团结，依靠了各族各界人民的团结。在进行团结工作当中，共产党起了核心的、主要的作用。共产党大公无私，实事求是，与党外人士民主协商进行工作的优良作风，已经是有目共睹、有口皆碑的事实。但是，在党对政府的领导方法上，以及在党同非党团结协作的实际工作中，还不能说是已经尽善尽美了。共产党是我们国家事务的领导核心，这一点是绝对不能动摇的；共产党的决定通过政府来实现，这也是肯定不移的。在我们湖南也是这样做的。在这里，共产党好比是神经中枢，通过政府、人民团体和全体群众来实现共产党的决定，有如“身之使臂，臂之使指”，必须气血周流，脉络贯通，才能收到得心应手之效。如果我这个比方恰当的话，我就觉得：在有些工作中，气血脉络还欠灵活呼应；党对政府的领导以及党同非党的团结协作，也还未能达到有原则的乳水交融的境界。这就是美中不足之处。当然，从我个人来说，我在工作中的主动性也是不够的。我时常疏忽，对某些问题，总以为关系不大，不必囉嗦。其实，从工作的利益设想，从进一步巩固团结的观点考虑，从拥护共产党、热爱共产党的真情实感出发，我过去没有完全尽到职责，没有完全做到“知无不言，言无不尽”，是不对的。所以我应该说出上面这些由衷之言，希望共产党对政府在领导方法上注意改进，加强思想领导，建立科学的分工负责制，以此来更加加强党同非党的团结协作，更进一步地发挥所有国家工作人员的聪明才智和积极性，为建设社会主义社会的共同事业而努力。
    第二、这几年，中央各部在业务范围内指导各省作了很多工作，取得重大成绩。但中央有些部门在发布命令和指示时，常常太呆板，不灵活，这样就使下面不好办事，助长了下面的命令主义和“五多”现象。例如：捕苍蝇的数目要作统计；生猪养畜情况要作繁复的表报；而改进农业林业生产技术的指示，又往往格外具体琐屑，同本地情况不合。这些事情，都叫做不从实际情况出发。中国的地方大，南方的农业林业同北方的农业林业不同，中部地带同边远地带又有不同，甚至一省之中，县与县之间也都有些不同。只此一端，就已说明一切工作的部署，在确定了总的方针以后，必须因地制宜，绝不能强求划一。我说的这些情况，经过反“五多”和反分散主义，虽说有了很大改变，但今后仍须严加注意，尽力防止，否则就有可能给计划经济建设带来损害，难于发挥地方办事的积极性，甚至把好事办成坏事。
    选我当人民代表，是人民给我的荣誉，是人民对我的信任，我只有按照人民的意志和委托，效忠人民民主制度，遵守宪法和法律，老老实实地为人民做事，替人民说话，克尽人民代表的职责。 
    邓子恢代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意并拥护周总理的政府工作报告。
    现在，我想就农村工作和对农业社会主义改造问题，作一些补充的发言。
    我们农村工作的根本目的在于发展农业生产，只有农业生产发展，才能适应国家工业化和各种建设的需要，才能满足全国人民生活水平日益提高的需要，也才能进一步改善农民生活，从而巩固工农联盟，巩固人民民主专政。
    由于胜利地实现了土地改革，彻底消灭了封建剥削制度，解放了农业生产力，提高了广大农民的生产积极性；由于国家大量发放农业贷款，扩大城乡物资交流，大规模兴修水利，来扶持农业生产；加上奖励了大批农业劳动模范，开展了群众性的爱国增产运动，采取了推广新式农具、改良品种、增施肥料、防治病虫害、改进耕作技术等技术改革措施，五年来，我国的农业生产得到了迅速的恢复和发展。到一九五二年，全国粮食总产量已达三千二百七十一亿斤，棉花总产量达到二千五百八十四万担，大大超过了抗日战争前的水平。一九五三年，虽有较重的水旱灾害，粮食产量仍达三千三百亿斤左右；棉花虽减产较大，只有二千三百五十二万担，但较之战前的最高年产量，仍增加了百分之三十八点六。今年长江流域和淮河流域的大水是百年以来少有的，但由于夏季麦子丰收（较去年约增产七十亿斤），大部地区的秋庄稼也生长良好，估计今年粮食、棉花的产量仍可超过一九五三年。在农民生产积极性和生产力提高之后，农村中造林护林、发展畜牧与捕鱼养鱼等事业也有了很大发展。所有这些，就使农民生活得到了改善，并为工业发展提供了必要的条件。
    我们的农业生产虽有了很大发展，但距离国家和人民的需要还很远，我们的粮棉产量还不能满足全国人民丰衣足食的要求，许多农产品和工业原料作物出现了供不应求现象。特别从去年开始，我们国家已进入有计划的经济建设的新时期，工业迅速发展，人民收入增加，购买力日益增长，就更显得我们的农业生产落后于国家工业化和人民生活改善的需要。
    为什么产生这种现象呢？这就是由于我国的农业还存在两种落后状态。首先在生产关系上，目前大量存在的是个体小农经济，他们在生产中仍有许多困难不能解决，因此他们的生产力虽然逐年有所增长，但增长得很慢，稍微遇到灾害和疾病就要减产和受到贫困的威胁，这是一方面。其次，正由于这种小农经济大量存在，我国的工业又尚未发展起来，因此农业设备上也仍然是落后的，一直到现在，我们的农业生产，仍然是依靠畜力和旧式农具，而不是使用机器，是人工灌溉，而不是机器灌溉，是自然肥料，而缺少化学肥料。由于这两种落后状态，我们的农业生产，在土地改革后虽然逐年有所增长，但增长速度远远落后于工业发展的速度，还不能适应国家工业化和人民生活改善的需要，长此下去，还可能引起乡村资本主义的泛滥。这对整个国家的计划建设是很不利的，对农民也是不利的。为了进一步发展我们的农业生产，以适应工业化和人民生活改善的需要，并进一步使所有农民都富裕起来，避免资本主义剥削的痛苦，就必须从两方面来加以改造：一方面要改造现有的生产关系，把个体农民组织起来，经过互助合作，使现有的对生产资料的农民个体所有制改造成为农民集体所有制，这就是合作化，集体化。另一方面是改造农业设备，作到农业机械化，实行机器生产，机器灌溉，施用化学肥料。这就是说，我们的农业机械化要建立在集体化的基础之上，走社会主义道路，而不是走资本主义的道路。如果实现了这两方面的改造，那么，我们就不仅可以大大提高单位面积产量，而且可以大规模开垦荒地，大大扩大耕地面积，最后还可以克服水、旱、病、虫等自然灾害，逐渐改变“靠天吃饭”的局面。这就是我国农业发展的美好前景。
    但是，由于我国现在还不能制造拖拉机，汽油生产量还很少，而农民的社会主义觉悟，又不是一下子能够提高，这就要求我们对农业的社会主义改造要分作两步走：第一步实行社会革命，达到合作化；第二步实行技术革命，达到大规模机械化。在合作化方面，也要分两个步骤，我们目前采用的主要形式是以土地入股、统一经营为特征的部分集体所有制的农业生产合作社，以后再有步骤地转到完全集体所有制的高级农业生产合作社（也就是集体农庄）。在机械化方面，也要分两个步骤，在我国自己尚未能大量制造拖拉机、抽水机，大量生产汽油以前，应在合作化基础上，大力推广马拉的（或牛拉的）双轮双铧犁和其他新式农具，使农业的生产工具得到初步改进；在国营农场及有条件地区使用部分拖拉机，以创造经验，培养骨干；到将来自己能大量制造拖拉机、抽水机，大量生产汽油的时候，再实行大规模的机械化。这就是我国对农业社会主义改造所能采取的唯一正确的方针和切实可行的步骤。
    为什么我们要采取以土地入股、统一经营为特征的合作社作为目前农业合作化的主要形式？这是因为它具有三个优点：首先，是土地统一经营，便可以因地种植，发挥地力，其他生产资料可以统一调配，社内劳动力可以统一使用，这种合作社也可能进行各种技术改革，这样就可以做到人尽其才，地尽其利，物尽其用，从而能够大量增产；其次，农民入社后，仍保持土地所有权，土地可以取得一定比例的报酬，这样就易于为农民所接受，而在吸收他们入社之后，又可以逐步改造他们对土地的私有观念；再次，这种合作社比较容易接受国家计划，通过同供销合作社和国营企业的合同关系，一方面可以按照国家计划进行生产和供应，另一方面又可以取得国家的各种援助。这就是我们目前要采取这种合作社作为主要形式的理由。但是这种合作社仍是一种过渡形式。经过这种过渡形式，把个体农民组织起来。过了若干年，生产力发展了，社员觉悟提高了，具备了一定的物质条件和精神条件，就可以逐步地顺其自然地转到完全集体所有制的高级农业生产合作社。这样就可以避免突然变化所可能引起的种种损失。所以这种过渡形式的合作社虽然是较低级的，但它却是我国对农业进行社会主义改造所必经的过程。我们农村工作当前的基本任务，就正是要开展以发展这种合作社为中心的农业增产运动。
    从一九五三年冬季以来，由于在农村中普遍进行了关于过渡时期总路线的宣传教育，并实行了粮食的计划收购和计划供应，农业生产合作社有了迅速的发展，到今年八月止，全国已经发展到十万多个，其中绝大多数社办得还好。在合作社的带动下，互助组的数量也增加了，质量也提高了。这就为今年秋后合作社大发展准备了有利条件。同时，农村供销合作、信用合作和手工业生产合作也有很大发展，渔业合作、牧业合作、造林合作也正在各地推行。农民的社会主义觉悟提高了，广大农村中的阶级关系有了新的变化：贫农（包括新中农在内）兴奋积极，成为合作化运动的骨干，中农更倾向于社会主义，富农在经济上受到限制，政治上开始被孤立，走社会主义的道路已经成为乡村舆论的中心，所有这些都是有利于社会主义改造的伟大变化。当然，这并不是说农业合作化运动没有毛病和缺点，相反的，有的地方未能贯彻自愿原则，发生急躁冒进，强迫命令；有的地方又有些放任自流；也有的地方在中农和贫农的关系上未能很好贯彻互利原则，或者表现为排斥贫农，压低劳力报酬，或者表现为过分压低土地报酬，或者在其他方面使中农吃亏。所有这些毛病和缺点，都是应该纠正的。同时，也不是说所有农民对于农业社会主义改造的认识和理解已经没有问题了，相反的，必须了解，广大群众不是经过一次运动一次宣传就可以完全理解社会主义的。农民是看事实的，不是光靠宣传可以说服，而是要靠实例示范。现在各地还有一部分农民（主要是中农），甚至已经参加了互助合作的农民，对于社会主义仍怀有某种程度的顾虑，这是不足为怪的。因此，除了对农民继续进行宣传教育之外，必须坚决贯彻依靠贫农（包括新中农在内）、巩固地团结中农、限制和逐步消灭富农经济这个正确的政策，必须按照正确政策办事，使互助合作运动发展得更健康，合作社办得更好，以树立榜样，来迎接行将到来的农业合作运动的新高涨。据各地现有计划，到明年春耕时，农业生产合作社将发展到五十万个以上，参加的农户将达到一千万户以上。如果明年把这五十万个社真正办好了，预计到一九五七年，全国就可能有一半以上的农户和土地参加农业生产合作社。信用合作社（包括信贷部分）现已发展到五万个，预期明后年可在全国绝大部分地区达到乡乡有社。供销合作组织现除少数民族地区外，已普及到各区乡各集镇，预计三、五年内，可在全国主要地区基本上控制农村商业阵地。这就是我国农村合作化的大体规划。毛主席在“论人民民主专政”一文中早已明确指示：“没有农业社会化，就没有全部的巩固的社会主义”，所以我们必须配合社会主义工业化的发展，经过互助合作形式逐步实现对农业的社会主义改造，实现宪法所规定的任务，把我国建成为繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。
    为促进合作化，发展农业生产，必须进行各种技术改革措施。在这方面，我们过去已作了许多工作，也收到了一定的成效，今后仍要加紧进行。首先，要大力推广马拉（或牛拉）的双轮双铧犁及其他新式农具，达到深耕目的。其次，要推广良种，增施肥料，改良土壤。第三，要繁殖耕畜，改良畜种，防治畜疫。第四，要改善耕作方法，防治病虫害。这些措施，农业部门应根据理论与实践相结合、技术与群众相结合、推广先进经验与当地具体情况相结合的原则，采取有效的办法，因地制宜地逐步使之实现。要努力办好国营农场、牧场、水产企业、拖拉机站、抽水机站以及省、专区、县、农场和技术推广站等，以先进的增产技术向农民、牧民、渔民示范，来促进农业生产及畜牧水产事业的发展。此外，还要办好农业院校、训练班与农业科学研究事业，大量培养农业技术人员和会计人员，以适应今后农业合作化和改进农业技术的需要。
    为促进农业合作化，发展农业生产，还应当加强水利工作，这不仅是农业增产的先决条件，而且是保证工业建设和交通运输安全、保护人民生命财产的重要关键。在这方面，几年来我们已有了很大成就，像今年这样的百年来少有的大水，我们所受的灾害比之一九三一年要轻得多，这就说明人民政府是真正为人民办事的。但我们不能以此自满，今后应当更加加强水利工作，除了大型水利工程由国家直接投资举办，江、淮、河、汉及其他大河流的流域规划正由中央水利部门研究设计之外，各地应当积极开展群众性的多种多样的小型农田水利建设运动，并对地方流域规划从事研究与设计，分年分步地加以治理，以达到减少受灾面，扩大灌溉面，来配合合作化的农业增产运动及各种建设工作。
    同发展农业同时，还要在合作化基础上开展广泛的群众性的护林造林运动，以期做到保持水土、涵养水源、防御风沙、改造气候、培养森林资源，同时有计划有节制地采伐木材，来供应国家建设及人民用材的需要。我国有广大荒山，不仅可以大量造林，而且可以种植各种经济作物，尤其在南方更宜于种植热带、亚热带植物。这不仅可以扩大森林面积，而且可以增加人民生活资料、工业原料及出口物资的供应，还可以增加山区人民的收入。这也是我们经济建设的一个重要方面。除了积极发动广大农民及国营企业进行护林造林外，我们还希望归国华侨和国内私营工商业者向山林投资，协助国家来共同开发山区经济，国家将保证给投资者以充分时间的合法经营权，使经营者有利可得。
    此外，还应当加强气象工作，这虽是一个新兴事业，但在几年来气象预报中已显示它的重大作用。今后应当积极发展高空探测和地面探测站，大量培养气象工作人员，加强预报工作，使气象工作能够更有效地为预防灾害、发展农业生产服务，为国防及各种经济建设服务。
