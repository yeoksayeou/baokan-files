Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 13th: TASS Moscow, September 13th: V.M. Molotov's reply to questions posed by Mr. Suzuki, Editor-in-Chief of the Japanese newspaper "Chubu Nippon Shimbun," the full text is as follows:

Dear Mr. Suzuki: I have received your letter raising questions concerning Soviet-Japanese relations.

As per your request, I hereby answer these questions.

One, "Regarding the issue of concluding a treaty of neutrality or a treaty of non-aggression between Japan and the Soviet Union.

Following the Geneva Conference, world public opinion is increasingly in favor of establishing relations of coexistence between East and West as quickly as possible. The Japanese people, with the exception of a very small minority, certainly do not wish to be in a hostile relationship with the Soviet Union or to form such a relationship with the Soviet Union again.

Therefore, what are your views now on the possibility of concluding a treaty of neutrality or a treaty of non-aggression between Japan and the Soviet Union?"

Answer: It is known that the Soviet government's relations with other countries proceed from the recognition of the principle of peaceful coexistence with countries of different social systems, and from the premise that unresolved international issues can be resolved through agreement, provided the parties concerned make efforts to reach an agreement. The Soviet people firmly believe that such a policy not only conforms to the interests of the Soviet people but also to the interests of the people of other countries who hope to ease international tensions and consolidate peace.

The Soviet Union has consistently pursued a policy of peace and striven to develop normal relations with all countries that wish to maintain normal relations with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is pursuing the same policy towards Japan, but until now, there are no normal relations with Japan, although the issue of normalizing these relations has matured. Needless to say, the resolution of this issue will make it possible to examine specific issues in Soviet-Japanese relations.

Two, "Regarding the re-establishment of normal relations between Japan and the Soviet Union.

Despite the fact that nine years have passed since the end of the Second World War, and despite the increasing desire of people in many countries for the restoration of peaceful coexistence between East and West after the Geneva Conference, normal relations between Japan and the Soviet Union have still not been restored.

I deeply regret the above facts, and I would like to know what you consider to be the obstacles currently hindering the re-establishment of normal relations between our two countries?"

Answer: I believe that the main obstacle hindering the re-establishment of normal relations between our two countries is that some Japanese individuals are following the instructions of the American ruling circles, who are trying to keep Japan in a subordinate position. Naturally, Japan cannot remain in such a semi-occupied state for long.

As for the Soviet Union, it has expressed its willingness to normalize its relations with Japan, if Japan also expresses the same desire.

Three, "Regarding the development of trade between Japan and the Soviet Union.

I believe that trade relations between neighboring countries, as well as the greatest possible expansion of such trade relations, are natural, and therefore, this is also an inevitable desire of the Japanese and Soviet peoples.

What specific measures do you think can be taken to develop trade between Japan and the Soviet Union?"

Answer: The Soviet Union advocates the development of trade relations with Japan on the basis of mutual benefit, as this is in the interests of both peoples. This has been proven by the experience of when the Soviet Union and Japan maintained a large volume of trade, which brought considerable benefits to both sides. It should be pointed out that the possibilities for developing existing trade between the Soviet Union and Japan have not been fully utilized.

More frequent contacts between individuals and delegations concerned with Soviet-Japanese trade can serve as a concrete measure in this regard. The issue of exchanging official trade delegations between the Soviet Union and Japan on an equal and reciprocal basis can also be discussed.

Four, "Regarding the rearmament of Japan.

The Japanese people do not want their standard of living to be lowered due to rearmament or increased armed forces. However, at the same time, they believe that an independent and sovereign state is allowed to maintain its independent armed forces, in accordance with the minimum needs of self-defense and according to its economic capacity.

What is your view on Japan's armed forces for self-defense?"

Answer: The Soviet Union advocates the large-scale reduction of armaments by all countries and advocates the unconditional prohibition of the use of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction.

At the same time, the Soviet Union proceeds from the premise that every sovereign state can maintain the armed forces necessary for self-defense.

It is known that the Soviet government, in its proposed peace treaty with Japan, stipulated that an independent, peaceful, and democratic Japan could maintain the armed forces necessary for self-defense.

Five, "Regarding the development of cultural ties between Japan and the Soviet Union.

I firmly believe that the development of cultural ties between Japan and the Soviet Union will have a positive impact on strengthening genuine friendly relations between Japan and the Soviet Union, even if we cannot expect to establish normal relations between our two countries in the near future.

What is your opinion on this issue?"

Answer: The Soviet Union is willing to maintain and strive in various ways to develop cultural relations with other countries, including Japan. In recent years, many scientific and cultural delegations from other countries have visited the Soviet Union, and Soviet cultural delegations have also visited many foreign countries. It is known that several delegations from Japan have also visited the Soviet Union. We have no doubt that there are many people in Japan, especially in the Japanese intellectual community, who sincerely strive to expand cultural ties with the Soviet people.

Undoubtedly, this will have a positive impact on strengthening friendly relations between Japan and the Soviet Union, which is of concern to our people and the people of other countries committed to developing international cooperation and consolidating world peace.

With respectful regards,

V. Molotov

    就有关苏联和日本关系的问题
    莫洛托夫答“中部日本新闻”问
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十三日讯：维·米·莫洛托夫答复日本报纸“中部日本新闻”总编辑铃木先生提出的问题，全文如下：
    敬爱的铃木先生：我已接到了您提出有关苏联和日本关系的问题的来信。
    按照您的要求，我在此答复这些问题。
    一，“关于在日本和苏联之间缔结一项中立条约或一项互不侵犯条约问题。
    在日内瓦会议以后，世界舆论正日益赞成在东方和西方之间以最快的速度建立起共处的关系。日本人民，除了极少数人以外，当然也不希望和苏联处于敌对的关系或再度和苏联形成这样的关系。
    因此，您现在对日本和苏联之间缔结一项中立条约或一项互不侵犯条约的可能性的意见如何？”
    答：大家知道，苏联政府和其他国家的关系是从承认和不同社会制度的国家和平共处的原则出发的，是从国际间悬而未决的问题可以通过协议求得解决这一前提出发的，如果有关方面都努力要取得协议的话。苏联人民深信，这样一种政策不仅符合苏联人民的利益，而且也符合其他国家的希望缓和国际紧张局势和巩固和平的人民的利益。
    苏联始终一贯地执行着和平政策，并努力和一切想和苏联保持正常关系的国家发展正常的关系。苏联对日本也执行着同样的政策，但直到现在，和日本并没有正常的关系，虽然使这种关系正常化的问题已经成熟。不消说，这个问题的解决会使审查苏联和日本之间的具体关系问题成为可能。
    二，“关于重新建立日本和苏联之间的正常关系问题。
    尽管第二次世界大战结束后九年已经过去，尽管在日内瓦会议之后，许多国家的人民要求东西方之间恢复和平共处的愿望日益增长，但是日本和苏联之间的正常关系仍然没有恢复。
    我对上述事实深感遗憾，我愿意知道您认为目前阻碍我们两国重新建立正常关系的障碍是什么？”
    答：我认为，阻碍我们两国之间重新建立正常关系的主要障碍是某些日本人士听从力图使日本处于附属国地位的美国统治集团的指使。自然，日本是不能长期处于这样一种半被占领国的状态的。
    至于苏联，它表示愿意使它和日本的关系正常化，如果日本也将表示同样的愿望的话。
    三，“关于发展日本和苏联之间的贸易问题。
    我相信，邻国之间的贸易关系以及这种贸易关系的尽可能扩大是自然的，因此，这也是日本人民和苏联人民的一种必然的愿望。
    您认为采取一些什么具体办法能使日本和苏联之间的贸易得到发展？”
    答：苏联主张在互利的基础上发展和日本的贸易关系，因为这是符合两国人民的利益的。这一点已经为苏联和日本保持着大量贸易的时候的经验所证实，这种贸易曾经给双方带来不少的好处。应该指出，苏联和日本之间发展现有的贸易的可能性远没有加以利用。
    关心苏日贸易的个人和代表团的更为经常的接触可以作为这方面的具体措施。关于苏联和日本在平等、互惠的基础上交换正式贸易代表团的问题也可以加以讨论。
    四，“关于日本重新武装的问题。
    日本人民并不希望他们的生活水平由于重新武装或增加武装部队而降低。但是，同时，他们认为，一个独立和主权国家，依照自卫的最低限度需要和根据它的经济能力保有它的独立的武装部队，是可以允许的。
    您对于日本自卫的武装部队的看法怎样？”
    答：苏联主张一切国家大量裁减军备，并主张无条件地禁止使用原子武器、氢武器以及其他大规模毁灭性的武器。
    同时，苏联是从这个前题出发的：每个主权国家可以保有自卫所必需的武装部队。
    大家知道，苏联政府在对日和约的建议中即曾规定：独立、和平与民主的日本可以保有自卫所必需的武装部队。
    五，“关于发展日本和苏联之间的文化联系。
    我深信发展日本和苏联之间的文化联系，对于加强日本和苏联之间的真正友好关系将产生积极的影响，即使在我们两国间不能期望在最近的将来建立正常关系。
    您对这个问题的意见如何？”
    答：苏联愿意保持并以各种方法努力发展和其他国家的文化关系，日本也包括在内。近几年来，其他国家的许多科学和文化代表团曾前来苏联访问，苏联的文化代表团也曾访问了许多外国。大家知道，日本也曾有几个代表团前来苏联访问。我们毫不怀疑，日本有许多人，特别是在日本的知识界中，都真诚地努力要扩大和苏联人民的文化联系。
    毫无疑问，这对于加强日本和苏联之间的友好关系将产生积极影响，这是我国人民以及致力于发展国际合作和巩固世界和平的其他国家人民所关心的。
    谨致敬意
                      维·莫洛托夫
                      一九五四年九月十一日
                                    莫斯科
