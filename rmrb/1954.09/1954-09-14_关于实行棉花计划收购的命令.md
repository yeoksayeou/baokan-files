    Regarding the Implementation of Planned Cotton Purchase
    (Passed at the 224th Session of the Government Administration Council on September 9, 1954)
    In order to guarantee cotton for the textile industry and to ensure the supply of cotton needed for the people's livelihood, it is decided to implement planned cotton purchase (hereinafter referred to as unified purchase) throughout the country starting from the autumn of 1954 when new cotton comes on the market. The implementation measures are as follows:
    1.  All cotton-producing farmers should sell all the cotton they produce to the state, except for the agricultural tax and necessary self-use portions, at the purchase price stipulated by the state. The state's cotton purchase work shall be handled exclusively by the state-owned China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation. The China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation may entrust supply and marketing cooperatives to act as purchasing agents.
    2.  Private cotton merchants and peddlers are strictly prohibited from engaging in the purchase and sale of seed cotton and lint cotton. Their employees shall be placed by the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation and the supply and marketing cooperatives, respectively, under the leadership of the local people's government. Private kapok retailers and peddlers will continue to be supplied with kapok by the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation to maintain their business. The private seed cotton processing industry shall be entrusted by the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation through the supply and marketing cooperatives for processing and shall not purchase seed cotton for self-sale after processing. The supply and marketing cooperatives should provide convenience for cotton farmers to process seed cotton for seed retention.
    3.  After the state purchase plan is completed, if cotton farmers have surplus cotton for their own use and need to sell it, the supply and marketing cooperatives may continue to purchase it.
    4.  The China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation and the supply and marketing cooperatives should promptly supply the kapok and hand-spun cotton needed by the people. In order to ensure that the textile industry carries out production according to plan, it is necessary to promote the conservation of kapok, save good cotton, use more inferior cotton, and utilize old cotton. Hand spinning should generally maintain the existing output and should not be developed.
    5.  People's governments at all levels should strengthen market management and conduct regular supervision and inspection. Speculators and counter-revolutionaries who violate and sabotage the planned cotton purchase shall be punished according to law.

    关于实行棉花计划收购的命令
    （一九五四年九月九日政务院第二百二十四次政务会议通过）
    为了保证纺织工业用棉，保证人民生活所需棉花的供应，决定从一九五四年秋季新棉上市时起，在全国范围内实行棉花的计划收购（简称统购）。实施办法如下：
    一、凡生产棉花的农民，应按照国家规定的收购价格，将所产棉花，除缴纳农业税和必要的自用部分外，全部卖给国家。国家的棉花收购工作，统由国营中国花纱布公司办理。中国花纱布公司得委托供销合作社代理收购业务。
    二、私营棉花商、贩，一律不得经营籽棉、皮棉的收购和贩运业务，其从业人员在当地人民政府领导下，由中国花纱布公司、供销合作社分别安置。私营絮棉零售商、贩，继续由中国花纱布公司供应絮棉，维持经营。私营籽棉加工业，统由中国花纱布公司通过供销合作社委托加工，不得自购籽棉，加工自销。对棉农留种用的籽棉，供销合作社应给以加工的便利。
    三、国家收购计划完成后，棉农留作自用部分的棉花，如有节余需要出售时，可由供销合作社继续收购。
    四、中国花纱布公司和供销合作社应及时地供应人民需用的絮棉和手工纺织用棉。为了保证纺织工业按计划进行生产，应提倡节约絮棉，省用好棉，多用次棉，利用旧棉。手工纺织一般应维持现有产量，不宜发展。
    五、各级人民政府应加强市场管理，经常地进行监督和检查。对违犯和破坏棉花计划收购的投机分子和反革命分子，应依法惩处。
                                          总理  周恩来
                                        一九五四年九月十四日
