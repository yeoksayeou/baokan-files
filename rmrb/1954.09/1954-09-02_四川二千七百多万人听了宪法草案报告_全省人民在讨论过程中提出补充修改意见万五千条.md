In the publicity and discussion, from both sides of the Yangtze River Three Gorges to the Tibetan Autonomous Region in northwestern Sichuan, from the Greater and Lesser Liang Mountains to the old revolutionary base areas on the border of Sichuan and Shaanxi, the vast urban and rural people participated in listening to reports and discussions with great excitement.
