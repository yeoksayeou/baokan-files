Disregarding Facts
—An Observer’s Article Published in the Soviet "Pravda"

    The delegation of leaders of the British Labour Party recently visited the Soviet Union and China. It should be remembered that the dispatch of this delegation was the result of the demands of the broad masses of people in the Labour Party who sincerely hoped to develop friendly relations with the people of the Soviet Union and China. The Labour Party's leadership could not ignore this demand.

    The reactionary elements in the United States and Britain hold a hostile attitude towards this decision of the Labour Party leadership, especially towards a statement by the delegation leader Attlee – that he would try to bring "peace and friendship" back from the Soviet Union and China. Members of the US Congress were particularly annoyed. For example, on August 18, more than forty columns of speeches attacking Britain for the Labour leader's trip were recorded in the "Congressional Record."

    However, it can be fairly said that some American newspapers have enough foresight not to panic about Attlee's intentions. For example, "The New York Times" did say that although Attlee had done something as unreasonable as this trip, he was still a loyal friend of the United States and had guaranteed 100% support for the Western defense system.

    This Labour leader proved the "New York Times" prediction one hundred percent. After traveling in the Soviet Union and China, he really did his best to support the "Western defense system"—the American propaganda term for war preparation—as soon as he crossed the Chinese border.

    Let's start from the beginning. After the delegation of Labour leaders arrived in Moscow, they had the opportunity to see what the Soviet people were doing, thinking, planning. The delegation was received by the leaders of the Communist Party and the Soviet government. In the Agricultural Exhibition, Attlee and his party could see with their own eyes the results of peaceful labor, tractors rather than tanks or artillery. The delegation visited the new buildings of Moscow University, which can by no means be regarded as military buildings. In short, since the Labour leaders had been to the Soviet Union, they could personally investigate the ideological trends and aspirations of the Soviet people. Judging from the speeches made by members of the delegation in Moscow, they were satisfied with the hospitality of the Soviet people, and they did not doubt the peaceful nature of Soviet construction work.

    The Labour leaders' delegation received the same hospitality in China. The delegates had the opportunity to understand the life of this great country, and Chairman Mao Zedong and other outstanding leaders of the People's Republic of China received them. The leaders of the delegation made speeches in favor of peace and friendly relations between the people of all countries.

    This was the situation before Attlee left China. As soon as he left China, which had welcomed him so hospitably, he immediately held a press conference in Hong Kong, where he hurried to pick up the "Western defense system’s" slanders about... "Soviet armament" to ease their work.

    According to Attlee, Chairman Mao Zedong mentioned in his conversation with him that the main conditions for maintaining peace are: stopping the rearmament of West Germany and Japan and withdrawing American armed forces from the Taiwan region—an inseparable part of China.

    Attlee did not dare to deny these irrefutable facts. He seemed to remember that Bevan, his colleague in the delegation, had fully confirmed these facts in the recent pamphlet "Never Let This Happen," which he and his Labour comrades published. For example, the pamphlet said that the United States was not seeking peaceful coexistence with Communist China in the Far East, but was preparing to launch another crusade against it at the first opportunity. The pamphlet pointed out that in Europe, Mr. Dulles had adopted the same policy... risking provoking a hydrogen bomb war.

    What did Attlee have to say in the face of these well-known facts? Nothing at all! In this case, it would of course be more honest to admit these facts and draw logical conclusions. But this would mean losing the favor of some people in the United States. This is what Attlee seemed to fear most... Therefore, the leader of the Labour delegation used the old-fashioned American propaganda to circumvent the problem. He clumsily attempted to shift the topic to... "Soviet armament." From Attlee's remarks at the press conference in Hong Kong, it can be known that in response to Mao Zedong's talk about the need to stop the rearmament of West Germany and Japan and withdraw American armed forces from the Taiwan region, he asked Mao Zedong to convey such a desire to the Soviet government: the Soviet Union... should begin unilateral (as it is in the original) disarmament.

    Therefore, Attlee made it very clear that the leader of the British Labour Party was prepared to agree to the American policy of reviving German and Japanese militarism.

    It is no accident that Attlee agrees with the US policy of arming the most aggressive forces in Europe and the Far East. Everyone knows that he is a strong supporter of arming West Germany. In a radio speech, he openly advocated that if the French National Assembly refused to ratify the Paris Treaty, other methods should be used to establish revengeful troops in West Germany, which the American aggressive bloc hopes to use to launch another offensive to the East. Attlee and the American allies of the German revanchists want to talk about "Soviet armament" to divert world public opinion from the dangers of reviving German and Japanese militarism.

    It is no accident that Attlee's statement coincides with the new slander campaign launched by American propaganda organs and its British echo chambers against the trumped-up "Soviet armament."

    It would be futile to look for normal logic in this trick. Everyone knows that the Soviet Union has repeatedly put forward concrete proposals for reducing the armaments of major powers, but Britain and the United States have always obstructed the adoption of such proposals. And it is also generally known that the Soviet Union is reducing its defense budget every year, while the United States and Britain are constantly increasing their military spending.

    Does Mr. Attlee really not know about the plan to expand armaments announced by US Assistant Secretary of Defense John Hannah on July 31 this year, and the fact that everything is related to launching a full-scale war against the Soviet Union?

    Does Attlee not know about the recent open war-mongering remarks by Bullitt, Clark, Van Fleet, Gruenther and other prominent American leaders? Then why did he decide to suggest that the Soviet Union unilaterally reduce its armaments, and not call on the United States to stop war preparations and stop inciting war psychology?

      "The London Daily Mirror" revealed the significance of Attlee's remarks. The newspaper wrote: Attlee has forever dispelled the worries of American newspapers and extremely conservative British newspapers. "The Times" also assured that some people did not believe that his trip to China was a trap of communist propaganda, and Attlee did not disappoint these people's trust.

    So, this is the key after all! It seems that what the leader of the Labour delegation is really worried about is mainly that the United States may take his remarks about "peace and friendship" seriously, because any call for peace and friendship is usually referred to by members of the US Congress as "communist propaganda". This is why he issued the infamous "appeal" to the Soviet Union. In Attlee's view, this will obviously restore his reputation in the eyes of the American and British reactionary groups.

### 不顾事实——苏联“真理报”发表的观察家的文章

    不顾事实
    ——苏联“真理报”发表的观察家的文章
    英国工党领袖代表团最近访问了苏联和中国。人们当记得这个代表团的派出是工党中真诚希望发展与苏联和中国人民的友好关系的广大人士要求的结果。工党领导机关不能对这个要求置之不顾。
    美国和英国的反动分子对于工党领导机关的这一决定，尤其是对于代表团团长艾德礼的一段话——他将设法从苏联和中国把“和平与友谊”带回来——都抱着敌对态度。美国国会议员特别恼怒。譬如，在八月十八日，“国会纪录”中载有四十多栏就工党领袖这次旅行抨击英国的言论。
    不过，可以很公正地说，某些美国报纸有足够的远见，并没有因为艾德礼的意图而惊慌失措。譬如，“纽约时报”果然就说，虽然艾德礼竟做出像这次旅行这样不合情理的事情来，但是他仍然是美国的忠实朋友，并且已经保证百分之百地支持西方防御体系。
    这位工党领袖百分之百地证明了“纽约时报”的预言。他在苏联和中国旅行过以后，一过中国边界就真的竭尽全力来支持“西方防御体系”——美国宣传对战争准备的称呼。
    我们从开头谈起吧。在工党领袖代表团到达莫斯科以后，他们有机会看到苏联人民做些什么，想些什么，计划些什么。代表团受到共产党和苏联政府领袖的接待。在农业展览会里，艾德礼和他的一行可以亲眼看见，在那里陈列的是和平劳动的成果，是拖拉机而不是坦克或大炮。代表团参观了莫斯科大学的新建筑物，这是决不能看作军事建筑的。总之，工党领袖们既然到过了苏联，他们便可以亲自调查苏联人民的思想趋向和愿望是怎么样的。从代表团团员在莫斯科发表的言论看，他们对于苏联人民的款待是满意的，他们不怀疑苏联建设工作的和平性质。
    工党领袖代表团在中国受到了同样的款待。代表们有机会了解这个伟大的国家的生活，中央人民政府主席毛泽东和中华人民共和国的其他杰出领袖接见了他们。代表团的领袖们发表演说赞成和平和各国人民之间的友好关系。
    这是艾德礼离开中国以前的情况。他一离开了那么好客地欢迎他的中国，就立即在香港举行了一次记者招待会，会上他赶快拾起“西方防御体系”的鼓吹者关于……“苏联军备”的谰言来减轻他们的工作。
    据艾德礼说，毛泽东主席在同他谈话时提到维持和平的主要条件是：停止重新武装西德和日本与美国武装部队撤出台湾地区——中国的不可分割的一部分。
    艾德礼不敢否认这些无可置驳的事实。他似乎记得，代表团中的他的同僚比万在他和他的工党同志们最近出版的小册子“决不能让这种情况发生”中完全证实了这些事实。例如，这本小册子说，美国在远东不是力求同共产党中国和平共处，而是准备一旦有机会就对它再度发动一次十字军。小册子指出，在欧洲，杜勒斯先生采取了同样的政策……冒着挑起一场氢弹战争的危险。
    艾德礼在这些大家熟知的事实面前还有什么可说呢？丝毫没有！在这种情况下，如果承认这些事实并得出逻辑的结论，那当然是比较老实的。但是这会意味着失去美国某些人的欢心。这是艾德礼看来最害怕的事……因此，这位工党代表团团长就使用了老一套的美国宣传手法来规避问题。他笨拙地企图把话题转移到……“苏联的军备”上。从艾德礼在香港的记者招待会上的谈话可以知道，在回答毛泽东关于需要停止重新武装西德和日本并从台湾地区撤退美国武装部队的谈话时，他要求毛泽东向苏联政府转达这样的愿望：苏联……应该开始单方面（原文如此）裁减军备。
    因此，艾德礼十分清楚地表明，英国工党领袖准备同意美国的复活德国和日本军国主义的政策。
    艾德礼赞同美国武装欧洲和远东的最富侵略性的力量的政策，这并不是偶然的。大家知道，他是热烈支持武装西德的。他在一篇广播演说中公开地主张万一法国国民议会拒绝批准巴黎条约的时候，用其他办法在西德建立复仇军，而这是美国侵略集团希望用来再度向东方发动进攻的。艾德礼和德国复仇分子的美国盟友要谈论“苏联军备”来转移世界舆论对复活德国和日本军国主义的危险性的注意。
    艾德礼的声明和美国宣传机关和它的英国应声虫所发动的反对莫须有的“苏联军备”的新的诽谤运动不谋而合，这并不是偶然的。
    在这种花样中要寻找正常的逻辑，将是白费力气。大家知道，苏联已不止一次地提出关于裁减大国军备的具体建议，而英国和美国却始终阻挠采取这种建议。而且大家也普遍地知道，苏联每年都在减少国防预算，而美英两国却在不断增加他们的军事开支。
    美国助理国防部长约翰·汉纳在今年七月三十一日所发表的关于扩大军备的计划，关于一切都和向苏联发动全面战争有关的事实的声明，难道艾德礼先生果真不知道吗？
    艾德礼难道不知道布立特、克拉克、范佛里特、格仑瑟和其他著名美国领袖最近公开鼓吹战争的好战言论吗？那么，他为什么决定建议苏联单方面裁减军备，而不呼吁美国停止战争准备和停止煽动战争心理呢？
      “伦敦每日镜报”透露了艾德礼的谈话的意义。这家报纸写道：艾德礼已永远驱除了美国报纸和极端保守的英国报纸的忧虑。“泰晤士报”也保证说，有些人不相信他到中国旅行是上了共产党宣传的圈套，艾德礼没有辜负这些人的信任。
    所以，这毕竟是关键所在！看来，工党代表团团长所真正担心的主要是美国可能把他所发表的关于“和平与友谊”的言论当真看待，因为任何呼吁和平与友好的呼声通常都是被美国国会议员称为
  “共产党宣传”的。这就是他为什么向苏联发出丑名远扬的“呼吁”的原因。在艾德礼看来，这显然
  一定能重振他在美英反动集团眼中的名声。
