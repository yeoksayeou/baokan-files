　　The peach, plum, and Taiping fruit are successively entering the market in large quantities. The wholesale markets in the eastern and western suburbs of Jinzhou City are showing a prosperous scene. Since August, the daily fruit market volume has increased more than threefold compared to July. State-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in Jinzhou City have promptly established purchasing stations, organized purchasing groups, and vigorously carried out purchasing work. At the same time, they sent salesmen to Shenyang, Changchun, Harbin, Qiqihar, Jiamusi and other places to establish contacts and timely supply the needs of these large cities.

　　This year, the fruit harvest in the vicinity of Jinzhou City is good, and orchard farmers are demanding a large supply of means of production and daily necessities. The Jinzhou City Company of China Department Store has long prepared a large number of blue cloth, blue cloth, towels, and various floral fabrics and floral socks loved by girls, which are continuously transported to various supply and marketing cooperatives. Orchard farmers who sell fruit are flocking to the cooperatives to happily purchase various production and daily necessities.

    水果丰收的季节
    水蜜桃、李子和太平果陆续大量上市的时候，锦州市东郊和西郊的批发交易市场上，呈现出一片繁荣景象。八月份以来，每天水果的上市量，比七月份增加三倍多。锦州市的国营商业部门和供销合作社及时设立收购点，组织收购组，大力展开收购工作。同时，派出推销员到沈阳、长春、哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、佳木斯等地建立联系，及时供应这些大城市的需要。
    今年，锦州市附近地区水果收成良好，园农们要求供应大批生产资料和生活用品。中国百货公司锦州市公司，早就准备了大批青布、蓝布、毛巾和姑娘们喜爱的各种花布、花袜子等物品，源源运到各地供销合作社。卖出水果的园农们，正纷纷到合作社愉快地选购各种生产和生活用品。　（柳耀东）
