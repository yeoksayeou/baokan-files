Beijing Sports Workers
Summer Factory Guidance Work Concludes
During the summer vacation, a group of sports workers from Beijing conducted five weeks of sports guidance work in twelve major factories and mines in Beijing. They trained more than 350 sports work cadres and cultivated more than 1,200 calisthenics leaders. They carried out the work of developing and rectifying broadcast calisthenics among nearly 10,000 workers and staff, and also rectified various sports teams. Now the guidance work has ended.

The sports work cadres who completed the training basically understood the significance of sports work in factories and mines, and initially mastered some basic techniques and coaching methods suitable for the current conditions of factories and mines, and that can effectively enhance physical fitness. After rectification, the sports teams of various factories and mines began to conduct planned exercises. Warm-up activities before exercise and cool-down activities after exercise have also become indispensable contents of the sports teams.

This time the sports workers went to factories for guidance was organized by the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions and the Beijing Municipal People's Government Sports Commission. During their work in the factories and mines, the sports workers were welcomed by the workers and staff, especially the young sports activists. Night shift workers at the Shijingshan Power Plant said: "Doing pre-work calisthenics makes my mind clearer, and I work more energetically." In the process of rectifying calisthenics, the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory created the experience of establishing workshop calisthenics promotion groups to be responsible for different work areas and work sections. Broadcast calisthenics before work at the Shijingshan Power Plant and the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory have been fully launched. Other factories have also gained experience in doing exercises for different types of work and different shifts, creating extremely favorable conditions for gradually carrying out the work in a comprehensive manner.

    北京市体育工作者
    暑期下厂辅导工作结束
    暑期中，北京市一批体育工作者在北京市十二个主要厂矿中进行了五个星期的体育辅导工作，共训练了体育工作干部三百五十多人，培养了领操员一千二百多人，在将近一万职工中进行了开展和整顿广播体操的工作，同时整顿了各种运动队。现在辅导工作已经结束。
    完成训练的体育工作干部，基本上了解了厂矿体育工作的意义，初步掌握了一些适合当前厂矿条件、且能有效地增强体能体力的基本技术和教练方法。各厂矿的运动队经过整顿，开始进行有计划的练习。运动前的准备活动和运动后的整理活动也已经成为运动队不可缺少的内容。
    这次体育工作者下厂辅导，是由北京市总工会和北京市人民政府体育运动委员会组织的。在厂矿工作期间，体育工作者受到职工群众特别是青年体育积极分子的欢迎。石景山发电厂的夜班工人说：做了工前体操头脑清醒多了，干起活来也起劲。长辛店机车车辆修理工厂在整顿体操的过程中，创造成立车间体操推行小组，按工区、工段分头负责的经验。石景山发电厂、北京农业机械厂劳动前的广播体操已经全面展开，其他各厂也都取得了不同工种不同班次做操的经验，为逐步全面开展创造了极为有利的条件。（新华社）
