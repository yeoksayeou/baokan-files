Literary and art circles indicated that they would strive in artistic practice to support the liberation of Taiwan.
The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, together with the Chinese Writers Association, the Chinese Dramatists Association, the Chinese Artists Association, the Chinese Musicians Association, the Chinese Ballad Singers Research Association, and the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Dancers Association, convened writers and artists in Beijing on September 4th for separate symposiums to study and discuss the joint declaration of the democratic parties and people's organizations of the People's Republic of China for the liberation of Taiwan. More than one hundred people attended the symposiums.

At the symposium held by the Chinese Writers Association, everyone unanimously agreed that liberating Taiwan is of great significance for the unification of the motherland and the guarantee of peace in Asia and the world. Lao She said: In addition to doing a good job in our respective fields, literary and art workers should also vigorously publicize and write more works to fight for the early completion of this sacred task. Xie Bingxin said: The people of Taiwan are living in dire straits under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and many have been killed by the Chiang bandits. She expressed her determination to redouble her efforts for the sacred task of liberating Taiwan.

The Chinese Dramatists Association and the Chinese Ballad Singers Research Association jointly held a symposium. At the meeting, everyone unanimously agreed that liberating Taiwan is to ensure world peace, and without the liberation of Taiwan, the socialist construction of the motherland will be affected. Mei Lanfang, Zhou Xinfang, Xiao Changhua, and others talked about the past when Taiwan was invaded by Japan sixty years ago, and they felt particularly excited about the determination of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan today. Chang Xiangyu said: In the future, we should strive to perform for workers in factories and construction sites, inspire their production enthusiasm, and increase strength for the liberation of Taiwan. Li Shaochun, Ye Sheng, and others actively expressed their willingness to go to the front line to perform for the soldiers. Lian Kuoru and Hou Baolin also expressed their desire to strengthen the unity of the opera and ballad circles, work hard to create, and enable opera and ballad work to play a role in propaganda and encouragement in the struggle to liberate Taiwan.

At the symposium held by the Chinese Artists Association, veteran painters Chen Banding, Ye Gongchuo, Yu Feian, Fu Xuezhai, and others were already in their teens when Japan invaded Taiwan. The situation at that time, when the people of the whole country were indignant and insisted on resisting, left a very deep impression on them. They said that the Chinese people have never forgotten the recovery of Taiwan for sixty years, and they must personally see Taiwan return to the embrace of the motherland. Wang Chaowen, an artist who had just returned from a visit to Poland, said: The liberation of Taiwan is the demand of the Chinese people and also the demand of the people of the world.

At the symposium jointly held by the Chinese Musicians Association and the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Dancers Association, everyone expressed their determination to support the struggle to liberate Taiwan with practical actions, work hard to create songs for the liberation of Taiwan, and strive to have songs for the liberation of Taiwan sung throughout the country in the shortest possible time. Use majestic songs to boost morale, inspire people, and strive to complete this sacred task as soon as possible.

    文艺界表示要努力艺术实践支援解放台湾
    中国文学艺术界联合会会同中国作家协会、中国戏剧家协会、中国美术家协会、中国音乐家协会、中国曲艺研究会和中国舞蹈研究会筹备委员会，约集在京的作家和艺术家，九月四日分别举行座谈会，学习和讨论中华人民共和国各民主党派、各人民团体为解放台湾联合宣言。参加座谈会的共有一百多人。
    在中国作家协会举行的座谈会上，大家一致认为解放台湾，对祖国统一和保障亚洲及世界和平，具有重大意义。老舍说：文艺工作者除了搞好本位工作以外，还应当大力宣传，多写作品，为早日完成这个神圣任务而斗争。谢冰心说：台湾人民在蒋匪集团统治之下，过的是水深火热的生活，许多人都被蒋贼杀害了。她表示，要为解放台湾这一神圣任务而加倍努力。
    中国戏剧家协会和中国曲艺研究会联合举行了座谈会。会上，大家一致认为解放台湾就是保障世界和平，台湾不解放，就影响祖国的社会主义建设。梅兰芳、周信芳、萧长华等都谈到六十年前台湾被日本侵占的往事，对今天中国人民解放台湾的决心，感到特别兴奋。常香玉表示：今后要争取多到工厂、工地为工人演出，鼓舞他们的生产热情，为解放台湾增加力量。李少春、叶盛兰等人都积极表示，愿到前线去为战士们演出。连阔如、侯宝林也表示要加强戏曲界的团结，努力创作，使戏曲工作在解放台湾的斗争中发挥宣传、鼓舞作用。
    在中国美术家协会举行的座谈会上，老画家陈半丁、叶恭绰、于非暗、傅雪斋等，在日本侵占台湾时，他们已十多岁，当时全国人民举国悲愤，并坚持抵抗的情形给他们留下了极深刻的印象。他们说，六十年来中国人民从来没有一刻忘记过收复台湾，他们一定要亲眼看到台湾重回祖国的怀抱。刚由波兰访问归来的美术家王朝闻说：解放台湾是我国人民的要求，也是全世界人民的要求。
    在中国音乐家协会和中国舞蹈研究会筹备委员会联合举行的座谈会上，大家纷纷表示要用实际行动，支援解放台湾的斗争，努力创作解放台湾的歌曲，争取在最短期内，全国各地都唱起解放台湾的歌，用雄壮的歌声，鼓舞士气，激励人心，争取早日完成这一神圣任务。
