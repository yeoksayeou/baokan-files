After Becoming Masters of the Enterprise
Xin'an Electric Motor Factory Fitter Hu Weikang

Hu Weikang, a 54-year-old worker, has been a fitter in the assembly workshop of Shanghai Xin'an Electric Motor Factory for many years. Soon after the factory became a joint state-private enterprise, he actively studied and improved the "slip ring device" and the mold for the outlet wire of fast and slow motors, which was valued and encouraged by the Party, administration, and trade union.

Hu Weikang joined the Xin'an factory in 1946. Initially, the capitalist wanted to fire him because of his age. However, seeing that he was quick and could drill 1,000 holes a day compared to the 400 drilled by others, he was reluctantly kept at the Xin'an factory. After the liberation of Shanghai, he actively participated in various movements in the factory. Through democratic reform and the "Five-Anti" campaign, his class consciousness gradually increased, and he worked more actively. He was elected as a labor protection committee member of the trade union, sent to a sanatorium in Hangzhou for recuperation, and was elected as a district people's representative three times in a row. This further encouraged his enthusiasm for production. However, due to the corrupt and backward management system of the capitalist enterprise, the workers' talents could not be brought into play. Once, Hu Weikang saw that the coils of 300 totally enclosed motors often burned out, resulting in a high rate of repairs, wasting a lot of labor, and causing industrial accidents, which affected the date of state orders. He proposed installing "flat coils" to ensure product quality and safe production. Engineer Xu Huilin agreed, but the capitalist, seeing that this improvement would cost money, used the excuse of financial difficulties and shelved the proposal. Thus, this proposal related to safety production and improving product quality was never implemented.

February 1 this year was a happy day for Hu Weikang, a happy day for all the workers in the factory. The Xin'an Electric Motor Factory was approved by the government to become a joint state-private enterprise. He thought: I have been working at the fitter's bench for 34 years, my hands are covered with calluses. In the past, I was exploited by the capitalist, but now I have become the master of the factory. Now I can contribute all my skills to the country.

After the joint venture, he saw that the repair rate of the slip ring motors manufactured in the factory was still high, wasting a lot of labor and affecting the country's order needs, he was very anxious. He thought: Now that I am the master of the enterprise, can I just watch the quality of the products supporting the construction of the motherland being poor? How great it would be if the repairs could be eliminated! Under the influence of the idea of supplying the country's construction needs with high-quality products, he made up his mind to gradually reduce the repair rate. He carefully studied the causes of the repairs, drew sketches at home during several holidays, and after collective research by the team, finally completed the drawing of the "slip ring device." The factory director (state representative) immediately encouraged him when he heard the news: "I agree with your opinion, go ahead! I hope you do it well and succeed. If you have any difficulties, I will help you solve them." Whenever Hu Weikang recalled that his talents could not be brought into play in the capitalist enterprise, and reviewed the state representative's encouragement, his enthusiasm became even greater. With the encouragement of the Party and the administration, the slip ring device was improved, and the repair rate of the slip ring motor was reduced from then on.

After the joint venture, Hu Weikang kept thinking: I am the master of the enterprise, and I must be responsible for production. Therefore, from the factory's joint venture to now, he alone has put forward five rationalization proposals and technical improvements. He not only completed the production plan on schedule, but also saved a lot of labor and raw materials. For example, in the past, the copper joints of the lignite flower board of fast and slow motors required many processes, which were harmful to labor and materials, and the quality of the parts was poor and the specifications were inconsistent. After he improved two sets of molds, the processes were reduced, the products produced met the standards, and 20% of the purple copper skin raw materials and 60% of the labor were saved. Hu Weikang said: Today, with the support of the Party and the encouragement of the administration and trade union, we can actively put forward proposals. In capitalist enterprises, capitalists often shake their heads and say to the proposals put forward by workers: "Money is difficult, it is impossible to test production..."

Now, Hu Weikang often says to people: "Everyone is responsible for transforming the old enterprises. More people, more strength, socialism will come sooner. We old people, now have great energy, not only for ourselves, but for everyone, for the socialist industrialization of the motherland. There is an old saying: predecessors plant trees, descendants enjoy the fruit. If everyone does not plant trees, future generations will not be able to eat them. So I have to work harder than before." (Tong Chengxin, Yan Hongbin)

Datong Iron Factory Lathe Group Leader Qian Yonggen

Qian Yonggen is an old worker in the joint state-private Datong Iron Factory, and has good skills. He is now the production team leader of the lathe group in the factory. In the past and now, his production tasks have always been overfulfilled every month, but there are two fundamentally different ideas that govern him.

Before the joint venture of the Datong Iron Factory, Qian Yonggen envied being the boss. He often said to other workers: Being a worker is not promising, being a boss is "decent." He remembered that one day last year, a person who used to be a worker but later became a boss came to the factory. Qian Yonggen saw that the person was dressed beautifully and riding a bicycle, which was a bit "stylish," so he wanted to be a boss even more. At that time, someone told him about the future of the working class and the prospects of socialism, but he didn't listen at all.

If he wanted to be a boss, he first needed capital. Qian Yonggen tried to "accumulate funds." Before the joint venture of the Datong Iron Factory, in order to win over the workers, the factory had a "super production bonus system," which was actually a disguised wage system. During each estimate of work, Qian Yonggen tried his best to estimate more work hours. Once, when making a part for the outer blank of the lathe, it originally only took 75 minutes to make, but he insisted on increasing it to 90 minutes. In order to get more bonuses, he desperately pursued quantity. As a result of pursuing quantity, the work they did was often returned by the inspection agency. However, Qian Yonggen's monthly "bonus" was even more than his monthly salary.

In order to be a boss, Qian Yonggen had been deceived, but he did not learn his lesson. One day in 1950, his "best friend" persuaded him to start a pen factory with others. He happily took out two million yuan to invest in the shares. After the factory opened, these people usually ate well and dressed well, but later said that the factory lost 20 million yuan and asked Qian Yonggen to take out more money. Qian Yonggen refused and was even sued. But this did not teach him a lesson. He thought: "I don't understand the business of making pen tubes, so I was deceived by them. If I open a factory to make machine parts, no one can deceive me." He planned to buy a lathe, recruit two apprentices, and do piecework for the outside world.

In November last year, the factory carried out the study of the general task of the state's transition period. During the study, everyone compared the old and new societies and educated themselves on the prospects of socialism, and criticized capitalist ideas. Qian Yonggen couldn't help but think of his childhood, which he spent in pain. He herded cattle for the landlord at the age of twelve, and didn't even have money to get a haircut all year round, and was often bullied. Later, he went to work in the factory, and was busy until dark every day, but still suffered beatings and scoldings. He thought of the past days, looked back at the present life, and felt that his ideas were wrong. In February this year, after the factory announced the joint venture, with the transformation of the enterprise, Qian Yonggen's thinking became clear. He said painfully at a team meeting: "My past idea was that I forgot the pain after the wound healed. I must never take the road of exploiting others again in the future." Qian Yonggen not only understood that he could not take the capitalist road, but also knew that to realize socialism, he must first rely on the efforts of the working class. From then on, Qian Yonggen was determined to do a good job in production.

Soon after the joint state-private venture, various systems in the factory were reformed, and the "super production bonus system," which was a disguised wage system, was also abolished at the request of the workers. Qian Yonggen's enthusiasm for production became greater and greater. Just as he said himself, "In the past, I was deceived by the capitalist, greedy for output, regardless of quality. Now, for the country's socialist construction, I must increase output and ensure quality." The facts prove that Qian Yonggen is doing what he said. In the second quarter of this year, the production tasks were completed ahead of schedule every month. In July, some workers in their team asked for leave due to personal matters, delaying more than 20 workdays throughout the month, but their plan was still completed six days ahead of schedule. There were also individual workers in the team who were not motivated to work because they could not get "bonuses." He immediately criticized this idea. In production, Qian Yonggen always played a leading role. Once, a comrade in the team was sick. When Qian Yonggen saw the lathe stop, he was very anxious, so he tried to watch two lathes alone. In the past, one tool was used when turning round gaskets, but now two tools are used, and both output and quality have been improved. Because Qian Yonggen's thinking has changed, his class consciousness has improved, his labor attitude has also changed, and he is usually enthusiastic in helping workers. He was accepted as a glorious Communist Party member in June this year.

This study of the draft constitution has made Qian Yonggen more clear that labor is a glorious cause in the new China. At a team meeting for studying the constitution, he said excitedly: "We are no longer 'smelly coppersmiths.' We working people are the most glorious." (Jia Ming)

    成了企业主人以后
    新安电机厂钳工胡伟康
    五十四岁的老年工人胡伟康，已经在上海市新安电机厂装配车间当了好多年钳工。该厂公私合营不久，他积极钻研，改进了“滑环装置”和快慢马达出头线模子，受到了党、行政和工会的重视与鼓励。
    一九四六年，胡伟康进了新安厂工作。当初，资本家看他年纪老，要停他生意。但资本家见他手脚快，别人每天钻四百只眼子，他一天钻一千只眼子，这样才算勉强的留在新安厂。上海解放后，他积极参加厂里的各项运动，通过民主改革和“五反”工作，阶级觉悟逐步提高，工作更加积极，被大家推选为工会劳动保护委员，并选他到杭州休养所去休养，并曾接连当选了三次区人民代表。这样，就益加鼓励了他的生产积极性。但由于资本主义企业经营管理制度的腐朽落后，工人才能得不到发挥。有一次，胡伟康见到三百匹全封闭马达的线圈常烧坏，退修率很高，浪费人工很多；而且还要发生工伤事故，影响国家订货日期。他就提出装“平平圈”的建议，以保证产品的质量和安全生产，当时许惠麟工程师也同意了，可是资方见到这个改进要花钱，借口厂里财务困难，就把这个建议搁在一旁。这一关系着安全生产，提高产品质量的建议，就这样没有下文。
    今年二月一日，是胡伟康高兴的一日，是全厂工人高兴的一日，新安电机厂被政府批准为公私合营，他想：我做了三十四年的钳床，双手满是厚茧，过去是被资本家剥削，如今成了工厂企业的主人，这一下自己的技术能全部贡献给国家了。
    合营后他见到厂里制造的滑环马达退修率还很高，浪费人工很多，影响国家的订货需要，心里很着急。他想：做了企业的主人，还能眼看着支援祖国建设的产品质量不好吗？如果能消灭退修该多好呢！就在以优质产品来供给祖国建设需要的思想支配下，他下了决心，一定要逐步的减少退修率，他细心地研究了退修的原因，经过几个假日在家里画出了草图，再经过小组集体共同研究后，终于把设计“滑环装置”的图样画成功了。厂长（公方代表）知道了这个消息，立刻鼓励他说：“同意你的意见，搞吧！希望你好好搞成功，有困难，帮你解决。”每当胡伟康回想起在资本主义企业里自己的才能得不到发挥的时候，重温一遍公方代表的鼓励，他的干劲就更大了。在党和行政的鼓励下，改进了滑环装置，滑环马达的退修率，便从此降低下来了。
    合营后，胡伟康一直在想：我是企业的主人，要对生产负责。因此，从工厂合营到现在，他一个人就提出了五件合理化建议和技术改进意见，不但按期完成了生产计划，而且还节省了很多的人工和原料，例如过去快慢马达煤精花板铜节头，做起来工序多，伤工伤料，而且零件的质量不好，规格不一致，经过他改进二副模子，减少了工序，生产出来的产品，合乎标准，还节省了百分之二十的紫铜皮原料，节省了百分之六十的人工。胡伟康说：今天有党的支持，行政和工会的鼓励，我们才能积极的提出建议。在资本主义企业里，工人提出的建议，资本家常常摇头说：“钞票困难，无法试制……”。
    现在，胡伟康常常对人说：“改造旧企业，人人有责，多一个人多一把劲，社会主义就能早一天来到，我们老年人，现在劲头大，不光为了自己，是为了大家，为了祖国社会主义工业化。有句古话说得好：前人种树，后人吃果。如果大家都不去种树，子孙就吃不到了。所以我还要比以前更努力的生产。”　（童承信　严洪斌）
    大同铁工厂车床小组组长钱永根
    钱永根是公私合营大同铁工厂的一个老工人，有一手好手艺。现在担负着该厂车床小组的生产组长，过去和现在，他的生产任务一直是月月超额完成，但是前后却有两种根本不同的思想在支配着。
    在大同铁工厂合营以前，钱永根很羡慕做老板，他常对别的工人说：当工人没出息，当老板
  “体面”。记得去年有一天，厂里来了一个曾经是工人后来当了老板的人，钱永根看见那人穿的挺漂亮，骑着机器脚踏车，很有点“派头”，于是他就越想当老板了。那时有人给他讲工人阶级前途，社会主义远景，他却一点也听不进去。
    想当老板首先需有本钱。钱永根就想办法“积累资金”。大同铁工厂在合营前，资本家为了拉拢工人，厂里有一种实际上是变相工资制的“超额生产奖金制”，在每次估工时，钱永根就尽量争取多估些工时，有一次做车床外胚的一种零件，本来只要七十五分钟就可以做好，他硬要增加为九十分钟。为了多拿奖金，他就拚命追求数量，追求数量的结果，使他们做的活常被验收机关退回来，可是钱永根一个月的“奖金”却比一个月的薪金还多。
    为了当老板，钱永根曾受过骗，但是他并没有接受教训。一九五零年有一天，他的一个“最好的朋友”劝他和别人合股开钢笔厂，他欣然地拿出二百万元入了股，开厂后，这些人平时吃好的，穿好的，到后来却说工厂亏了两千万元，要钱永根再拿出钱来，钱永根不干，还被人家告了一状。但是这并没有使他得到教训，他还以为：“我不懂做钢笔管的生意，才被他们骗了，要是开个做机器零件的厂，谁也骗不了我。”他计划买一部车床，招两个学徒，给外面做包活。
    去年十一月间，厂里进行了国家过渡时期总任务的学习，学习中大家进行了新旧社会对比和社会主义前途的教育，对资本主义思想进行了批判。钱永根不由得想起痛苦中渡过的童年生活，十二岁给地主放牛，一年四季连剃头的钱都没有，还常要受气。后来到厂子里做工，一天忙到黑，所得到的还是挨打受骂。他想起过去的日子，回头看看眼前的生活，越觉得自己的想法不对头。今年二月间厂子宣布合营后，随着企业的改造，钱永根思想上明亮起来，他在一次小组会上沉痛地说：“我过去的想法是好了疮疤忘了痛，今后绝对不能再走剥削别人的道路。”钱永根不仅懂得了不能走资本主义道路，而且知道了要实现社会主义，首先要靠工人阶级努力。从此，钱永根心里打定主意，要搞好生产。
    公私合营后不久，厂子里各种制度经过改革，那种变相工资制的“超额生产奖金制”也在工人要求下取消了，钱永根的生产劲头却越来越大。正像他自己讲的“过去是受了资本家的骗，贪图产量，不顾质量，现在是为了国家社会主义建设，又要增加产量，又要保证质量。”事实证明钱永根按照他讲的话在做。今年第二季度的生产任务月月提前完成，七月份他们小组有的工人因事请假，全月耽误二十多个工，可是他们的计划还是提前六天完成。组里也有个别工人因为拿不到“奖金”，做活不起劲，他马上批判这种思想。在生产上钱永根处处起着带头作用，有一次小组一个同志病了，钱永根看到车床停下来，他很着急，于是想办法一个人看两部车床。从前车圆的垫片时用一把刀，现在用两把刀，产量和质量都提高了。由于钱永根的思想转变了，阶级觉悟提高了，他的劳动态度也变了，平时又能热心帮助工人，今年六月间已被接收为光荣的共产党员。
    这次宪法草案的学习，使钱永根更明确了在新中国劳动是光荣的事业，在一次学习宪法的小组会上，他激动地说：“我们再不是‘臭铜匠’，我们劳动人民是最光荣的。”　（贾　明）
