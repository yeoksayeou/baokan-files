After the Bulgarian people were liberated on September 9, 1944, the Song and Dance Ensemble of the Bulgarian People's Army was immediately established under the leadership of the General Political Department of the People's Army, under the name of the "Army Representative Choir." The artistic director of the Song and Dance Ensemble is Dragan Prokopiev.

During the Patriotic War, the Song and Dance Ensemble carried out extensive performances, often performing for the wounded returning from the front in hospitals, for troops heading to the front, or in factories and at various conferences. It also broadcast special programs for soldiers on the radio several times a week. The Song and Dance Ensemble helped army commanders cultivate new soldiers and enhanced the fighting will of new soldiers with the power of its singing art. Soldiers everywhere warmly welcomed the Song and Dance Ensemble, were proud of it, and never forgot its performances.

As a true people's cultural group, the Song and Dance Ensemble did not limit its activities to completing its own tasks. The Song and Dance Ensemble actively participated in the massive celebrations conducted by the people after the victory over fascism. It appeared everywhere with its novel and vibrant songs—at mass rallies attended by tens of thousands of people, various gatherings, celebration meetings, and other places.

When the war ended, the army returned, and all the working people of Bulgaria set about building their new country and restoring the devastated and plundered national economy—new and more important tasks were put before the Song and Dance Ensemble. All the Bulgarian people began socialist construction with great enthusiasm and will. At this time, the Song and Dance Ensemble shifted its performance direction to helping the people carry out peaceful recovery work. In the performance program, in addition to themes depicting victory and soldiers returning home, themes depicting labor heroes also appeared. Concerts and those lively and moving songs held at construction sites, factories, and enterprises improved the workers' labor mood and encouraged them to strive for greater achievements.

During this period, the Song and Dance Ensemble grew, the choir expanded, and the orchestra also had the size of a symphony orchestra. The Song and Dance Ensemble not only toured various troop garrisons in the country, but also performed for citizens, workers, and students. In this way, the name of the Song and Dance Ensemble spread among the army and the people, and it increasingly won the heartfelt love of all the Bulgarian people. The performance of the Song and Dance Ensemble in every village became a celebration—the Song and Dance Ensemble became a welcome guest everywhere.

The Song and Dance Ensemble has also gained great and well-deserved reputation abroad. In 1947, the Song and Dance Ensemble went to the Romanian People's Republic for a national tour, holding a total of twenty-one performances, which aroused great interest among the audience and achieved great success, becoming the focus of attention at the time. The Romanian People's Republic awarded the conductor of the Song and Dance Ensemble, Dragan Prokopiev, and all the soloists the "Art and Culture" Medal in recognition of the outstanding performance of the Song and Dance Ensemble.

In order to reward the tireless and successful work of the conductor Dragan Prokopiev and the actors of the Song and Dance Ensemble, the government of the Bulgarian People's Republic specially awarded the Song and Dance Ensemble the high honor of the Second Class "September 9th" Medal in April 1947. This appropriate evaluation and praise further promoted and encouraged all the members of the group. The Song and Dance Ensemble is growing stronger and constantly consolidating and strengthening its strength.

On October 1, 1948, a dance team was established in the Song and Dance Ensemble. Thus, the Song and Dance Ensemble had a complete form of song and dance ensemble, which was an unprecedented form in Bulgarian music performance. The dance team, led by the famous dance instructor Hristo Tsonev, participated in the Bulgarian dance delegations that performed at the World Youth Festivals in Prague, Budapest, and Berlin each time.

In 1950, due to the needs of the dance team, a folk instrument performance team was established in the Song and Dance Ensemble. This performance team, under the leadership of Manor Todorov, accompanied folk dances, thereby increasing the national characteristics of the dance.

In the autumn of 1951, the Song and Dance Ensemble went to the Hungarian People's Republic and the Czechoslovak Republic for performances, which received great attention and love from the people of these two fraternal countries.

In 1953, the tour of the Song and Dance Ensemble in the German Democratic Republic also achieved great success. In fifty-two days, the Song and Dance Ensemble held twenty-seven performances in twenty cities. Each performance of the Song and Dance Ensemble became a manifestation of the sincere friendship between the Bulgarian people and the German people.

In its ten years of activity, the Song and Dance Ensemble of the Bulgarian People's Army has steadfastly carried out its task—to conduct socialist education for the working people and the soldiers of the People's Army through new mass songs and folk dances. Learning from the experience of the Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble, the Song and Dance Ensemble of the Bulgarian People's Army will always follow the entire Bulgarian working people steadily and confidently towards building its bright future, towards building the direction of socialism. The Song and Dance Ensemble of the Bulgarian People's Army fights for a peaceful and happy life with its novel, lively, optimistic, and confident songs and dances.

    保加利亚人民军歌舞团介绍
    一九四四年九月九日，保加利亚人民获得解放后，保加利亚人民军歌舞团就立刻在人民军总政治部的领导下，以“军队代表合唱队”的名称成立了。歌舞团的艺术指导是德拉冈·普罗科彼耶夫。
    在卫国战争时期，歌舞团展开了巨大的演出活动，经常给医院中自前线回来的伤员、给开往前线的部队，或在工厂中，在各种大会上演出，每星期还特别在电台上为战士播送数次节目。歌舞团以自己演唱艺术的力量帮助了军队指挥员培养新的战士，提高了新战士战斗意志。各地战士都热烈欢迎歌舞团，为它感到自豪，并长久不忘歌舞团的演出。
    歌舞团作为一个真正的人民文化团体，并不把自己的活动局限在完成本身任务的范围内。歌舞团积极参加了在战胜法西斯以后人民所进行的巨大庆祝活动。它带着自己新颖的、富有生气的歌曲在各地出现——在成千成万人参加的群众大会、各种集会、庆祝大会和其他地方。
    当战争结束，军队回来，保加利亚全体劳动人民着手建立自己的新国家，并恢复遭到破坏和掠夺的国民经济的时候——在歌舞团面前便提出了新的更重要的任务。全保加利亚人民以高度的热情和意志开始了社会主义建设。这时，歌舞团将演出方针转向帮助人民进行和平恢复的劳动。在演出的节目中，除了描写胜利、战士回家等主题外，也出现了描写劳动英雄的主题。在建设工地、工厂和企业中举行的音乐会和那些富有生气、动人的歌曲，提高了工人的劳动情绪，鼓舞他们争取更大的成就。
    在这段时间中，歌舞团成长了，合唱队扩大了，乐队也具有交响乐队的规模。歌舞团不但到国内各个部队驻扎地作巡回演出，而且为市民、工人、学生演出。这样歌舞团的名字就在军队和人民中传开了，日益赢得了全保加利亚人民衷心的热爱。歌舞团在每一个村子的演出，都变成了一个庆祝会——歌舞团就这样成为到处受欢迎的贵客。
    歌舞团在国外也获得了巨大的受之无愧的声誉。一九四七年歌舞团到罗马尼亚人民共和国，作全国巡回演出，共举行了二十一次演出，引起了观众很大的兴趣，获得了巨大的成就，成为当时大家注意的中心。罗马尼亚人民共和国为了奖励歌舞团优秀的演出成绩，分别发给歌舞团的指挥德拉冈·普罗科彼耶夫和所有的独唱者以“艺术和文化”勋章。
    保加利亚人民共和国政府为了奖励歌舞团指挥德拉冈·普罗科彼耶夫和演员们的不倦的、有成绩的工作，特在一九四七年四月将很高的荣誉——二级“九月九日”勋章授予歌舞团。这个恰当的评价和赞许更加推动和鼓舞了全团人员。歌舞团日益壮大，并不断地巩固和增强着自己的实力。
    一九四八年十月一日，在歌舞团中成立了舞蹈队。于是歌舞团就具备了完整的歌舞团形式，这种歌舞团是在保加利亚音乐演奏方面前所未有的形式。以著名的舞蹈指导专家赫里斯托·曹奈夫为领导者的舞蹈队，每次都参加在布拉格、布达佩斯和柏林的世界青年联欢节演出的保加利亚舞蹈代表队。
    一九五零年因舞蹈队的需要，歌舞团中又成立了民间乐器演奏队，这个演奏队在马诺尔·托多罗夫领导下为民间舞蹈伴奏，从而增加了舞蹈的民族色彩。
    一九五一年秋，歌舞团赴匈牙利人民共和国及捷克斯洛伐克共和国演出，受到了这两个兄弟国家的人民极大的注意和热爱。
    一九五三年歌舞团在德意志民主共和国的巡回演出，也获得很大的成就。歌舞团五十二天中在二十个城市举行了二十七次表演，歌舞团的每次表演都成为保加利亚人民和德国人民真诚友谊的表现。
    保加利亚人民军歌舞团在十年的活动中，坚定不移地执行了自己的任务——通过新的群众歌曲及民间舞蹈对劳动人民及人民军战士进行社会主义教育。学习着苏军红旗歌舞团的经验，保加利亚人民军歌舞团永远跟着整个保加利亚劳动人民稳步地、满怀信心地向着建设自己光辉的未来、向着建设社会主义的方向前进。保加利亚人民军歌舞团用自己新颖的、活泼的、乐观及充满信心的歌曲及舞蹈为争取和平的、幸福的生活而斗争。
