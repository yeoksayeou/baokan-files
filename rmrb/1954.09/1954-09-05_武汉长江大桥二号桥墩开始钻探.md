    Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Pier No. 2 Begins Drilling
    The drilling work for Pier No. 2 of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is actively underway despite the high water level of the Yangtze River.
    Before the start of the drilling work for Pier No. 2 of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, various groups and individuals of the Yangtze River Bridge Geological Drilling Team all set up merit-making plans, guaranteeing to overcome all kinds of difficulties and complete the drilling task during the high water period of the Yangtze River.
    Although the workers had participated in the Hanyang dike rescue work not long before the start of the work, they walked onto the drilling ship with high spirits early on the morning of August 20. The diesel motor of the central hole, which had been stopped for nearly a month, started again, and plumes of green smoke rose straight into the sky as the work of lowering the casing began. Some workers drilled to the bottom of the boat to remove the reeds that were entangled around the drill hole, while others transported the casing at the fastest speed, checked the buckle threads, and added engine oil. At 9:00 a.m., the first section of the ten-inch casing began to be lowered into the riverbed amidst the rapids. When the second section of casing was being lowered, a large piece of wood suddenly floated down from upstream. Yan Youyi, the more than fifty-year-old deputy captain, scrambled up the eight-meter-high drilling tower, directing the lifting of the casing. Ma Fuyou, the central hole engine captain, was drenched in sweat under the scorching sun, holding the gate handle to lift the casing, so that the casing was not hit by the wood. Then another piece of wood floated down from upstream, jamming the casing. The young worker Liu He quickly took off his clothes, put on a safety belt, drilled to the support at the bottom of the drilling ship, and pried the wood open. The first casing of the central hole thus reached the bedrock and began drilling on August 26.
    The anchoring and positioning work for the No. 7 pier drilling ship, which had been moved by a log raft strike on July 19, also began on August 23 for the second time. Now, Pier No. 7 is preparing for the work of lowering the protective casing.

### 武汉长江大桥二号桥墩开始钻探

    武汉长江大桥二号桥墩开始钻探
    武汉长江大桥二号桥墩的钻探工作，正在长江高水位的情况下积极进行。
    武汉长江大桥二号桥墩钻探工作开工前夕，长江大桥地质钻探队各个小组和个人都订出了立功计划，大家保证在长江高水位时期，克服各种困难完成钻探任务。
    虽然工人们在开工前不久还参加了汉阳堤防抢险，但在八月二十日一早，都精神饱满地走上了钻船。停顿了近一个月的中心孔柴油马达又开动起来，一团团青烟直升天空，下套管的工作开始了。有的工人钻到船底割除绊在钻孔四周的芦草，有的以最快的速度搬运着套管，检查扣丝，加上机油。上午九时，第一节十吋套管开始在激流中下到江底。当下第二节套管时，忽然上游漂来了一根大木料，五十多岁的副队长阎有一骨碌爬上了八公尺高的钻塔，指挥提升套管，中心孔机长马富有在烈日中汗流浃背，掌住闸把提升套管，使套管没遭到木料的撞击。接着上游又流下木料一根，将套管卡住，青年工人刘和迅速脱掉了衣服，戴上安全带钻到钻船船底的支撑上，将木料撬开。中心孔第一根套管就这样达到了岩盘，并已在八月二十六日开始钻探。
    原来在七月十九日遭到木排撞击因而移动了位置的七号桥墩钻船，第二次的抛锚定位工作也已于八月二十三日开始。现在，七号桥墩正准备下保护套管的工作。
