Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, September 9th: By 8:00 AM (Beijing time, same below) on August 31st, all main forces, local troops, and guerrillas of the Vietnamese People's Army on all battlefields in Vietnam had strictly abided by the ceasefire agreement and completed the steps of temporary assembly to isolate the forces of both sides on time.

The ceasefire agreement stipulated that the separation of the forces of the warring parties in Vietnam should be completed within fifteen days after the ceasefire was implemented on each battlefield. According to this provision, on the North Vietnamese battlefield, where the ceasefire took effect at 8:00 AM on July 27th, the Vietnamese People's Army had withdrawn all armed personnel from the area from Hanoi to Haiphong, which served as a temporary garrison area for the French Federation forces, before 8:00 AM on August 11th.

On the South Vietnamese battlefield, where the ceasefire took effect at 8:00 AM on August 11th, the Vietnamese People's Army concentrated its regular troops and guerrillas in the temporary garrison areas stipulated in the agreement, namely the Ca Mau Peninsula temporary garrison area at the southernmost tip of Vietnam, the Ham Tan and Xuyen Moc temporary garrison areas east of Saigon, and the Dong Thap Muoi Plain temporary garrison area west of Saigon, before 8:00 AM on August 26th.

In the Binh-Tri-Thien (Quang Binh, Quang Tri, and Thua Thien provinces) region and the Fifth Interzone in Central Vietnam, where the ceasefire took effect at 8:00 AM on August 1st, the Vietnam Central Joint Ceasefire Committee extended the isolation period by ten days and fifteen days respectively, based on actual needs. All armed forces and personnel of the Vietnamese People's Army in the Binh-Tri-Thien region had withdrawn to the area north of the temporary military demarcation line near the 17th parallel before 8:00 AM on August 26th, in accordance with the agreement. Before 8:00 AM on August 31st, a portion of the Vietnamese People's Army in the Fifth Interzone was concentrated in the temporary garrison areas of Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh provinces as stipulated in the agreement, and another portion was concentrated in the Ham Tan and Xuyen Moc temporary garrison areas in South Vietnam in accordance with the agreement. In this way, the Vietnamese People's Army had fully and effectively completed the work of temporary assembly.

In the process of completing this work, the various units of the Vietnamese People's Army overcame many difficulties. In the Binh-Tri-Thien region and the Fifth Interzone, especially in the various war zones of South Vietnam, the Vietnamese People's Army had been engaged in arduous guerrilla warfare for eight or nine years, and the troops were extremely scattered. There were often hundreds of kilometers between this unit and that unit, with towering mountains and rivers in between. Not only that, but the Vietnamese People's Army also encountered various obstructions and provocations from the American imperialist stooges in the Bao Dai-Ngo Dinh Diem clique's puppet army. In South Vietnam, these saboteurs, who clamored "not to recognize the agreement," often ambushed and surrounded the Vietnamese People's Army in transit, infringed upon the temporary garrison areas of the Vietnamese People's Army, and delayed the handover of roads that should have been handed over. On some sections of Highway 1 and Highway 22, the other side did not finally withdraw their troops until August 18th—halfway through the temporary assembly period—and some even destroyed bridges before withdrawing to increase the difficulty of the Vietnamese People's Army's transfer.

In order to maintain the ceasefire, the various units of the Vietnamese People's Army, with a high degree of tolerance, tried their best to avoid the occurrence of hostile actions. They crossed mountains and rivers, wading through rivers, and bypassed the puppet army strongholds that hindered their assembly. The people in various places also vigorously assisted the Vietnamese People's Army. The people in the cities occupied by the French army disregarded the danger and drove cars out of the cities to supply the Vietnamese People's Army. The people along the way concentrated countless boats to safely ferry thousands of people's fighters across rivers.

At present, the Vietnamese People's Army in the various temporary garrison areas are vigilantly guarding against the activities of anti-peace elements to disrupt the ceasefire, and at the same time are actively preparing to withdraw to the assembly area north of the temporary military demarcation line in accordance with the agreement.

### 严格遵照停战协定的规定  越南人民军已完成临时集结工作

    严格遵照停战协定的规定
    越南人民军已完成临时集结工作
    【新华社北越九日电】到八月三十一日八时（北京时间，以下同）为止，越南人民军一切主力部队、地方部队和游击队在越南各个战场上已经严格遵照停战协定先后按时完成临时集结以隔离双方部队的步骤。
    停战协定规定，越南交战双方部队的隔离应在各个战场停火实现后十五天内分别完成。按照这一规定，在七月二十七日八时停火的北越战场上，越南人民军于八月十一日八时以前已把一切武装人员全部撤出了作为法兰西联邦部队临时驻扎地段的从河内到海防的地区。
    在八月十一日八时停火的南越战场上，越南人民军于八月二十六日八时以前已将正规部队和游击队集中到协定所规定的越南最南端的薄寮省临时驻扎地段（即金瓯角临时驻扎地段）、西贡东面的咸津、川木临时驻扎地段和西贡以西的同塔梅平原临时驻扎地段。
    在八月一日八时停火的中越平治天（广平、广治、承天三省）地区和第五联区，越南中央联合停战委员会根据实际情况的需要，曾经将隔离的期限分别延长了十天和十五天。越南人民军在平治天地区的一切武装部队和人员已于八月二十六日八时以前按照协定全部撤到十七度线附近的临时军事分界线以北的地区。在八月三十一日八时以前，第五联区的越南人民军一部分集中到了协定所规定的广义、平定两省的临时驻扎地段，一部分遵照协定已集中到南越的咸津、川木临时驻扎地段。这样，越南人民军方面已经全部切实地完成了临时集结的工作。
    越南人民军各部队在完成这个工作的过程中克服了许多困难。在平治天地区和第五联区，特别是南越的各个战区，越南人民军由于八、九年来一直是在进行艰苦的游击战争，部队极为分散。这一部队和那一部队之间常常相隔数百公里，其间高山重叠，河流阻隔。不仅如此，越南人民军还遇到了保大—吴庭艳集团伪军中的美帝国主义的走狗们的种种阻挠和挑衅行为。在南越，这些狂叫“不承认协定”的破坏分子往往对正在移动中的越南人民军进行伏击和包围，侵犯越南人民军的临时驻扎地段，迟迟不让出应该让出的道路。在第一号和第二十二号公路的某些地段上，对方一直到八月十八日——临时集结时间已过去了一半的时候——才最后撤出了他们的军队，有的还在撤出前破坏了桥梁，以增加越南人民军转移的困难。
    越南人民军各部队为了维护停战，以高度的容忍精神，竭力避免敌对行动的发生。他们翻山越岭，跋涉河川，绕过了那些阻碍他们集结的伪军据点。各地人民也大力协助了越南人民军。在法军占领下的城市中的人民不顾危险把汽车开出城市来供给越南人民军使用。沿途的人民集中了无数的船只，将成千上万的人民战士安全渡过一道道河流。
    目前，各临时驻扎地段内的越南人民军正在警惕反和平分子的破坏停战的活动，同时积极进行按照协定最后撤到临时军事分界线以北集结地区的准备工作。
