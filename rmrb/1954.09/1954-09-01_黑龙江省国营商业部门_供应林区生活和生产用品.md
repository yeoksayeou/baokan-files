State-Owned Commercial Departments in Heilongjiang Province
Supply Living and Production Goods to Forest Areas

    State-owned commercial departments in Heilongjiang Province have strengthened the commercial network in the eastern forest areas, supplying the logging workers who live in the dense forests year-round with the commodities they need for life and production. At present, the state-owned stores scattered throughout the forest areas not only regularly supply food, general merchandise, medicines, cigarettes, alcohol, and kerosene, but also send out many sales teams to go deep into the forests with the logging teams to promptly supply the workers' needs.
    The logging tasks in the Yichun forest area, the largest forest area in Heilongjiang Province, are increasing year by year. The demand for tools such as saws and axes, as well as steel wire ropes, small hardware, and electrical materials needed by workers when felling and transporting timber, is also gradually increasing. In the past, these tools and materials were supplied by the hardware store in Jiamusi City, more than 400 miles away from Yichun County. Due to inconvenient communication, urgently needed bulk materials could not be supplied in time. At the end of the second quarter of this year, a large hardware store was established in Yichun, and the difficulties in supply during logging this winter will be resolved.

    黑龙江省国营商业部门
    供应林区生活和生产用品
    黑龙江省国营商业部门加强了东部林区的商业网，把生活和生产所需的商品，供应长期生活在密林中的采伐工人们。目前，遍布林区的国营商店除经常供应食品、百货、药品、烟、酒和煤油等外，还派出不少推销小组，随采伐队深入森林，及时供应采伐工人的需要。
    黑龙江省林区面积最大的伊春林区，采伐任务逐年增加。工人在采伐、流送木材时所需的锯子、斧头等工具及钢丝绳、小五金、电料等需要量也逐渐增多。这些工具材料，过去是由距伊春县四百多里的佳木斯市五金商店供应，由于联系不便，有时急需的大宗物资，不能得到及时供应。今年第二季度末，伊春设立了大型五金商店，今年冬季采伐时供应上的困难问题将可得到解决。
