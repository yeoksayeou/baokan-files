Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 16th - The Central Committee meeting of the Indian Communist Party began in Delhi on the 5th and ended on the 11th. The Politburo of the Indian Communist Party issued a communiqué on this meeting on the 13th.

The communiqué said: The Central Committee carefully studied the current international situation. The communiqué then described the great victories achieved by the forces of peace in the development of the current international situation, and the reasons for these victories. The communiqué exposed the American aggressive conspiracy in Asia, saying: The Central Committee emphasized that the provisions of the Southeast Asia Treaty fully demonstrate that the American and British imperialists are conspiring to continue to keep the colonial people in permanent enslavement, and are conspiring to undermine peace.

The communiqué said: "India is extremely concerned about all these developments, especially because India is the chairman of the International Supervisory and Supervisory Commission, and the imperialists are exerting pressure to drag Pakistan into the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

"The Communist Party pointed out that these events show that all the talk about two major power blocs vying for world hegemony is absurd. The Soviet Union and China have been unremittingly fighting for peaceful coexistence, while the imperialists refuse to accept this principle, and are denying the right to self-determination of all countries, as they have done."

The communiqué pointed out: "In this situation, the Central Committee decided to immediately launch a movement together with all democratic and progressive forces:

"1. To demand that the governments of all countries should agree to abide by the Five Principles expounded in the statement issued by Zhou Enlai and Nehru.

"2. To launch a movement to call for Asian solidarity and to demand that the Indian government, together with China, take steps to consult with Asian countries to defend Asian peace and security against the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization."

The communiqué said: "The Central Committee also called on its members and units to immediately launch a movement to demand that the Indian government sign treaties of friendship and cooperation with the Soviet Union, China, and all peace-loving countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit."

The Central Committee meeting of the Indian Communist Party also passed a resolution supporting the heroic struggle of the people in the Portuguese and French territories in India to be incorporated into India.

    印共政治局发表印共中央委员会会议公报
    主张各国政府应以五项原则为和平共处的基础
    【新华社新德里十六日电】印度共产党中央委员会会议五日在德里开始举行，至十一日结束。印度共产党政治局十三日就这次会议发表公报。
    公报说：中央委员会仔细地研究了目前的国际局势。公报接着叙述了在当前国际形势发展中和平力量取得的巨大胜利，以及取得这些胜利的原因。公报揭露美国在亚洲的侵略阴谋说：中央委员会强调指出，东南亚条约的条款充分表明，美英帝国主义者正阴谋继续使殖民地人民处于永久的奴役之下，并正在阴谋破坏和平。
    公报说：“印度对这一切发展至为关心，特别是因为印度是国际监督和监察委员会主席，并且帝国主义者正在施用压力，把巴基斯坦拖入东南亚条约组织。
    “共产党指出，这些事件显示了所有关于两个大国集团彼此夺取世界霸权的说法是荒谬之谈。苏联和中国一直在坚持不懈地为和平共处而奋斗，而帝国主义者拒绝接受这个原则，并且正像它们所做的那样，否认所有国家的自决权。”
    公报指出：“在这种情况下，中央委员会决定立即和一切民主的和进步的力量一道展开一个运动：
    “一、要求所有国家的政府应同意遵守周恩来和尼赫鲁发表的声明中所阐述的五项原则。
    “二、开展运动，号召亚洲团结并要求印度政府和中国一起采取步骤，使亚洲各国进行磋商，以保卫亚洲的和平与安全，反对东南亚条约组织。”
    公报说：“中央委员会还号召它的党员和单位立即发起运动，要求印度政府在平等互利的基础上和苏联、中国以及一切爱好和平的国家签订友好合作条约。”
    印度共产党中央委员会会议还通过决议，支持在印度的葡萄牙和法国属地人民争取归并于印度的英勇斗争。
