Xinhua News Agency, September 16th: Washington dispatch: Following British Foreign Secretary Eden and U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Murphy, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles also flew to Europe on the evening of the 15th to carry out aggressive activities to rearm West Germany after the collapse of the "European Defense Community" treaty.

Before his departure, Dulles stated that his trip was to explore ways to restore West German "sovereignty" and rearm West Germany. He will first meet with West German Chancellor Adenauer in Bonn, and then travel to London to meet with British Foreign Secretary Eden, who is working on a "new plan" to rearm West Germany.

Significantly, Dulles decided not to go to Paris this time.

Xinhua News Agency, September 17th: TASS, New York, September 17th: American newspapers believe that Dulles' trip to Bonn and London indicates that the United States is attempting to arm West Germany by allowing it to participate in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as an "equal member."

"New York Times" correspondent Reston in Washington said that Dulles' "deliberate bypassing of Paris" was to tell France that "the United States is determined to arm Germany, regardless of whether the French government agrees."

Reston continued: The United States particularly advocates West Germany's accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. If West Germany and Italy's accession to the Brussels Pact can help achieve this goal, it will not oppose their accession to the Brussels Pact. Reston said that "Washington officials" are unwilling to delay the matter of arming Germany any longer, "nor are they willing to let Germany join the Atlantic Alliance as a second-class member."

Reston pointed out: "What the United States fears is that the British initiative to discuss the issue of 'limiting German sovereignty' will trigger a political crisis in West Germany, and the State Department is trying to avoid such a crisis. Therefore, Dulles decided that it would be better not to let others take the initiative, so he and his tired team returned from the Philippines and immediately set off across the Atlantic."

Reston wrote that Dulles hopes that "a clear proposal on admitting West Germany to the Atlantic Alliance can be formally submitted by the end of this month. If other countries are unwilling to submit this proposal, then Washington is prepared to submit it itself."

### 美国务卿杜勒斯匆忙赶去西欧  进行重新武装西德的侵略活动

    美国务卿杜勒斯匆忙赶去西欧
    进行重新武装西德的侵略活动
     【新华社十六日讯】华盛顿消息：继英国外交大臣艾登和美国副国务卿帮办墨菲之后，美国国务卿杜勒斯也于十五日晚乘飞机赶赴欧洲，进行“欧洲防务集团”条约垮台后重新武装西德的侵略活动。
    杜勒斯行前发表谈话，说他此行是要去探求恢复西德“主权”和重新武装西德的办法。他将先到波恩与西德总理阿登纳会谈，然后转赴伦敦和正在为重新武装西德的“新方案”而奔走的英国外交大臣艾登进行会谈。
    意味深长的是，杜勒斯此次决定不到巴黎。
   【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社纽约十七日讯：美国报纸认为，杜勒斯的波恩和伦敦之行说明美国企图用使西德以“平等成员”资格参加北大西洋联盟的办法来武装西德。
    “纽约时报”驻华盛顿记者赖斯顿就杜勒斯“故意绕过巴黎”这一点说，这是为了告诉法国，“不管法国政府是否同意，美国坚决要武装德国”。
    赖斯顿接着写道：美国特别主张西德加入北大西洋联盟，如果西德和意大利加入布鲁塞尔公约能有助于达到这一目的，它将不反对它们加入布鲁塞尔公约。赖斯顿说，“华盛顿官方人士”不愿意再拖延武装德国这件事情，“也不愿意让德国以二等成员国的资格加入大西洋联盟”。
    赖斯顿指出：“美国害怕的是，英国人倡议讨论‘限制德国主权’的问题将引起西德的政治危机，而国务院正力图避免产生这种危机。因此，杜勒斯决定还是不把主动权让给别人好些，所以他和他那班疲倦的人马刚从菲律宾回来，马上又启程横渡大西洋了。”
    赖斯顿写道，杜勒斯希望“关于接纳西德参加大西洋联盟的明确建议能在本月底正式提出，如果其他国家不愿意提出这项建议，那么，华盛顿就准备亲自提”。
