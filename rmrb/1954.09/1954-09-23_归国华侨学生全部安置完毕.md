Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 22nd: Overseas Chinese students who returned to China to participate in this autumn's entrance examinations have all been successfully placed. The work of the Overseas Chinese Students Entrance Examination Committee for Secondary Schools has also come to an end. This year, the Overseas Chinese Students Entrance Examination Committee for Secondary Schools processed approximately seven thousand Overseas Chinese students. Among them, more than four thousand three hundred have been admitted to secondary schools and secondary vocational schools and have gone to Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan and other places to enroll. The remaining two thousand or so students, due to their low academic level or late arrival in China that caused them to miss the examination period, have been placed by the Admissions Committee in Overseas Chinese Secondary Remedial Schools in Beijing, Guangzhou, and Xiamen for remedial studies.

    归国华侨学生全部安置完毕
    【新华社广州二十二日电】回国参加今年秋季入学考试的华侨学生已全部安置完毕。归国华侨学生投考中等学校招生委员会的工作也随告结束。今年经过归国华侨学生投考中等学校招生委员会处理的华侨学生共有七千人左右。其中四千三百多人已考进中等学校和中等专业学校，并已分别到北京、天津、上海、南京和武汉等地入学。其余二千多人因程度过低或因回国过迟而赶不上考期的，也经招生委员会分别安置在北京、广州和厦门的华侨中等补习学校补习。
