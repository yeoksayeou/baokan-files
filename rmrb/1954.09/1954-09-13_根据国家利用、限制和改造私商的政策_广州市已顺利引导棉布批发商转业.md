    Under the policy of the state utilizing, restricting, and transforming private merchants,
    Guangzhou has successfully guided cotton cloth wholesalers to change professions.
    More than 30 cotton cloth wholesalers in Guangzhou have successively transferred to industries or service industries and joint state-private enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Before June of this year, 20 were transferred to industry and two to service industries. Most of the cotton cloth wholesalers who transferred to industry transferred their employees and funds to private factories in industries such as the chemical industry and the knitting industry that had already accepted state processing or sales. In addition, three independently established new factories. Recently, another eleven cotton cloth wholesalers have transferred their funds to joint state-private enterprises such as Huanan Enterprise Co., Ltd. and Guangzhou Cold Storage Ice Factory.
    Like grain and oil wholesalers in the past, cotton cloth wholesalers in Guangzhou have always stirred up trouble in the market and harmed the people. Since the state-owned cotton yarn and cloth company gradually expanded its control over cotton cloth sources in the second half of last year, the scope of activities of these wholesalers has been strictly limited. According to the state's policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming private merchants, the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government's industrial and commercial administration department began to gradually guide more than 30 cotton cloth wholesalers in the city to change professions starting in the fourth quarter of last year. In addition to assisting them in finding career change relationships, for wholesalers willing to switch to industry, they also organized them to visit factories and convene meetings of industrialists and businessmen to facilitate agreements, and helped them solve a series of specific problems after the career change. Cotton cloth wholesalers who changed professions earlier have now seen from practice that changing professions to production undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood has a future. Da Lai Store, which changed its profession to Jiankang Chemical Factory in April of this year, not only transferred all its employees to the factory to participate in production, but also, thanks to the support of the state-owned commercial department to the Jiankang Chemical Factory and the joint efforts of the factory and the store, the factory's business is developing day by day, new factory buildings have been built, and machinery and equipment have been purchased. The output of the factory's main product, lithopone, has increased by more than double compared to before the factory and store merged, and there is a monthly surplus, which is in stark contrast to the shrinking business of Da Lai Store before the career change. After Dexingtai and Dean, two cotton cloth stores, transferred their funds to Huanan Thread Factory, the factory increased its funds and added a batch of new machines such as automatic take-up machines, and production also developed day by day. Recently, this factory has been preparing to reorganize into a joint state-private enterprise. (Xinhua News Agency)

    根据国家利用、限制和改造私商的政策
    广州市已顺利引导棉布批发商转业
    广州市三十多家棉布批发商已先后转到有利于国计民生的工业或服务业以及公私合营企业。今年六月以前转到工业的有二十家，服务业的两家。转业到工业的棉布批发商，大部分是把店员和资金一并转到已经接受国家加工或包销的化学工业和针织工业等行业的私营工厂。另有三家独自建立了新厂。最近又有十一家棉布批发商把他们的资金转入华南企业股份有限公司和广州冷藏库制冰厂等公私合营企业。
    广州市的棉布批发商，像过去的粮食和油脂批发商一样，一向在市场上兴风作浪，为害人民。自从去年下半年国营花纱布公司逐步扩大对棉布货源的掌握后，这些批发商的活动范围已受到严格限制。广州市人民政府工商行政部门根据国家利用、限制和改造私商的政策，从去年第四季度开始，就逐步地引导全市的三十多家棉布批发商转业。除辅导他们找寻转业关系外，对愿意转向工业的批发商，还组织他们参观工厂和召开工商业者的会议促成协议，并帮助他们解决转业后的一系列具体问题。转业较早的棉布批发商，现在已从事实中看到转业到有利于国计民生的生产事业是有前途的。今年四月间转业到健康化工厂的大来商店，除全店从业人员都转入了工厂参加生产外，由于国营商业部门对健康化工厂的扶助和厂店双方的合力经营，工厂的业务日益发展，修建了新的厂房，增购了机器设备，这个厂主要产品立德粉的产量，已比厂店合并前提高一倍以上，每月都有盈余，和大来商店转业前营业萎缩的情况成了显明的对照。德兴泰和德安两家棉布商店把资金转到华南制线厂后，由于工厂增加了资金，添置了一批自动上线机等新的机器，生产也日益发展。最近这个厂已在筹备改组为公私合营企业。　（新华社）
