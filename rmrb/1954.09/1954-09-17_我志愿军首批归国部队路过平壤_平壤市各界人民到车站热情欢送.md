Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 15th: The train carrying the first group of returning troops of the Chinese People's Volunteers passed through the station of Pyongyang, the heroic capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, on the evening of the 14th, and was warmly seen off by thousands of people from all walks of life in Pyongyang.

　　Before it got dark, groups of men, women, old and young, holding up slogans and colorful flags, braved the drizzle and gathered at Pyongyang Station from all directions. Workers, staff, students, and Korean People's Army soldiers marched, singing songs and shouting slogans. Girls and children, dressed in festive costumes and holding flowers, and housewives carrying buckets of boiling water on their heads, and old people leading or carrying their grandchildren also came.

　　The platform was brightly lit, and the national flags of China and Korea and huge banners hanging on it were particularly conspicuous. The people crowded on the platform talked, laughed, sang, danced, and looked south, waiting for the arrival of the train.

　　At 7:30, the train carrying the first group of returning Chinese People's Volunteers slowly entered the station. The platform immediately resounded with thunderous applause and cheers. Before the train came to a complete stop, male and female soldiers of the People's Army, women, and children threw bouquets of flowers into the carriages. At this time, loud slogans were heard on the platform and in the carriages, exchanging thanks and farewells:

　　--Glory to the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers! Deep gratitude to the Chinese People's Volunteers for their just aid in holding high the banner of resisting America and aiding Korea! Long live the great Chinese people and Chairman Mao Zedong!

　　--Long live the victory of the common cause of the anti-aggression war of the Chinese and Korean people! Thank you to the Korean government and people for their constant care and support for our army! Long live the heroic Korean people and Marshal Kim Il-sung!

　　--Long live the unbreakable fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean people!

　　The commanders and fighters of the returning Volunteer Army stood at the doors of each carriage to receive flowers from the elders, brothers and sisters of Pyongyang, and shook hands warmly with the well-wishers to say goodbye. Girls, children, and male and female soldiers of the People's Army rushed to the carriage doors to ask the Volunteer Army commanders and fighters to sign their names in their commemorative albums. Housewives, carrying buckets of boiling water and holding water glasses, squeezed through the crowd and brought the glasses of water to the people on the train. Old men and women also stepped forward, took the hands of the Volunteer Army soldiers, stroked the dazzling anti-American and aid-Korea commemorative medals, medals and military merit medals on their chests, and cordially thanked and bid farewell to the Volunteer Army, and told them to convey the gratitude and blessings of the Korean people to Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese people.

　　The whistle sounded. After stopping at Pyongyang Station for ten minutes, the train continued north. The commanders and fighters of the returning Volunteer Army on the train saluted Pyongyang and waved goodbye; the well-wishers waved flags, sang, applauded, and shouted slogans to see them off. A chorus of "Goodbye" rang out on the platform.

　　The train slowly pulled out of Pyongyang Station, and many people in the crowd of well-wishers shed tears. Everyone then automatically reorganized the ranks, waiting to see off the returning Volunteer Army troops who would continue to arrive by train twenty minutes later.

    我志愿军首批归国部队路过平壤
    平壤市各界人民到车站热情欢送
    【新华社平壤十五日电】中国人民志愿军首批归国部队所乘列车在十四日晚路经朝鲜民主主义人民共和国民主首都——英雄城平壤的车站时，受到平壤市各界人民群众数千人的热情欢送。
    天还没黑，成群结队的男女老少，就高举着标语和彩色旗，冒着濛濛细雨，从四面八方向平壤车站集结，工人、职员、学生和朝鲜人民军战士们的队伍唱着歌、呼着口号行进，姑娘们和儿童们身穿节日服装手捧着鲜花，家庭妇女们头上顶着一铁桶一铁桶的开水，老人们领着或背着孙子也赶来了。
    月台上灯光辉煌，悬挂着的朝中两国国旗和巨幅标语显得格外显明。挤满在月台上的人们，谈着，笑着，唱着，舞着，翘首向南望着，等待着列车的到来。
    七时三十分，载着首批归国的中国人民志愿军的列车徐徐进站，月台上立刻响起了像春雷一样的掌声和欢呼声。还没有等列车停下来，人民军男女战士们、妇女们和儿童们就把一束束的鲜花掷到车厢里。这时，月台上和车厢里都发出了响亮的口号声，互相致谢和道别：
    ——光荣归于英雄的中国人民志愿军！深深感谢高举抗美援朝旗帜的中国人民志愿军的正义援助！伟大的中国人民和毛泽东主席万岁！
    ——朝中人民反侵略战争的共同事业胜利万岁！感谢朝鲜政府和人民对我军的经常关怀和支援！英雄的朝鲜人民和金日成元帅万岁！
    ——朝中两国人民牢不可破的战斗友谊万岁！
    志愿军归国部队的指挥员、战斗员们站在每一辆车厢的门口接受平壤父老兄弟姊妹们的献花，和欢送者热烈地握手，告别。姑娘们、儿童们和人民军男女战士们争先拥到车厢门口，要求志愿军指挥员、战斗员们在纪念册上签名。家庭妇女们顶着开水桶，捧着水杯，从人群里挤过去，把水杯送到车上人的手里。老大爷和老大娘们也挤上前去，拉着志愿军战士们的手，抚摸着他们胸前光辉夺目的抗美援朝纪念章和勋章、军功章，亲切地向志愿军致谢、道别，嘱咐他们向毛泽东主席和中国人民转达朝鲜人民的感谢和祝福。
  汽笛响了。列车在平壤车站停车十分钟后，继续北上。车上的志愿军归国部队的指挥员和战斗员们举手行军礼向平壤告别；欢送者举旗，唱歌，鼓掌，呼口号送别。月台上响起了一片“再见”声。
    列车徐徐地驶出了平壤车站，欢送的人群里有很多人落了泪。大家又自动地整理了队伍，等待着给二十分钟以后继续乘车到来的志愿军归国部队送行。
