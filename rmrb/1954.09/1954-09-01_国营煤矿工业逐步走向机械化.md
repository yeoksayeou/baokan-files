The state-owned coal mining industry in our country is advancing in the direction of mechanized production, and coal miners are gradually being liberated from heavy manual labor. Compared with 1950, the amount of coal mined mechanically in 1953 has increased approximately eleven and a half times. Now, in state-owned coal mines, outdated coal mining tools such as hand picks are no longer used. More than 60 percent of the coal in longwall working faces is mined by drilling holes with electric drills or pneumatic drills and then blasting. In addition, more than 33 percent of the coal is mined using combined coal mining machines, coal cutting machines, and pneumatic picks. In longwall working faces and roadways, 70 to 80 percent of the coal is transported by mechanical means. In the Northeast region, where mechanized coal mining is relatively common, some state-owned coal mines have now mechanized the entire process, from coal cutting, crushing, loading, transporting, and sorting to loading onto trains for transportation. The Soviet Union's latest combined coal mining machine was first put into operation at the Shuangyashan Mining Bureau in Northeast China in April 1952. Subsequently, it was used in Jixi, Fuxin, Jiaohe, Datong, Huainan, and other coal mines. This combined coal mining machine mechanizes all three heavy manual tasks of coal cutting, crushing, and loading, and its hourly work efficiency is equivalent to the production capacity of more than one hundred coal miners using hand picks for the same amount of time. The No. 2 Mine of Datong Mining Bureau created a new record in March this year by producing more than 16,000 tons of coal per month with one combined coal mining machine. The use of coal cutting machines is even more widespread. Currently, 24 mining bureaus or coal mines across the country are using coal cutting machines to mine coal under different conditions. The efficiency of coal cutting machines has increased from more than 3,200 tons per month per machine in 1950 to more than 7,400 tons per month per machine in the first half of this year. Electric locomotive transportation has been implemented in the mines of Jingxing, Huainan, Fushun, Benxi, Nantong, and other coal mines, changing the situation where transportation lagged behind coal mining in the past. In China's state-owned coal mines, natural ventilation has now been basically eliminated, and mechanical ventilation equipment has been installed, allowing underground miners to breathe fresh air. In Tongchuan Coal Mine in Shaanxi, where the promotion of mechanized coal mining started relatively late, electric drills and other coal mining machinery have been added in the past year to replace outdated manual tools such as hand picks and iron hammers, and underground transportation has also been replaced by mechanical equipment such as electric chutes instead of manual basket pulling or back carrying.

As a result of the adoption of new machinery in the national state-owned coal mining industry, not only has the physical labor of workers been reduced, but labor productivity has also been greatly improved. In the first half of this year, each coal miner in the country averaged more than three tons of coal per day in eight hours, nearly twice as much as in 1949. In the first quarter of this year, the production efficiency of underground workers in North China has increased by more than 100% compared with 1950. Since the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau used the electric loading machine jointly designed by Engineer Ruan Mengwu to load coal, it only takes five minutes to fill a 20-ton wagon, and the working efficiency is 50 times higher than manual loading.

Although the degree of mechanization of national state-owned coal mine production has greatly improved in recent years, it is still far from the requirements of the state. Due to the insufficient understanding of the importance of promoting mechanized production by some cadres and the failure to promote advanced Soviet experience well, the efficiency of mechanical equipment has not been fully utilized, and some equipment has been left idle or arbitrarily damaged. In order to further improve the degree of mechanization of coal mine production, the Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government convened the first National Coal Mine Mechanization Conference on August 2 this year, summarized the experience of promoting mechanized production in coal mines across the country in recent years, and criticized some cadres for several erroneous ideas regarding the promotion of mechanized production, requiring all mines to improve the utilization rate of existing mechanical equipment in the future, give full play to the efficiency of machinery, improve the technical level of employees, strive to eliminate mechanical and electrical accidents, and ensure the comprehensive completion of production tasks.

    国营煤矿工业逐步走向机械化
    我国国营煤矿工业正循着机械化生产的方向前进，煤矿工人们已逐渐地从笨重的体力劳动下解放出来了。一九五三年和一九五零年比较，机械采煤量已大约增长了十一倍半。现在，在国营煤矿里，手镐等落后的采煤工具已经没有了，回采工作面中百分之六十以上的煤都是用电钻或风钻打眼然后放炮的方法采出来的，另外百分之三十三以上的煤，已经用联合采煤机、割煤机和风镐采出的。在回采工作面和平巷中运输的煤有百分之七十几到百分之八十几是用机械来搬运的。在机械化采煤推行得比较普遍的东北地区，现在部分国营煤矿的矿井，从割煤、碎煤、装煤、运煤、选煤到装上火车运出去，整个过程都已经机械化。苏联最新式的联合采煤机一九五二年四月首先在东北双鸭矿务局下井，接着，又在鸡西、阜新、蛟河、大同、淮南等煤矿被使用。这种联合采煤机把原来需要手工操作的割煤、碎煤、装煤三项笨重工作全部机械化了，它一小时的工作效能等于一百多个手镐采煤工人同样时间的生产能力。大同矿务局二矿在今年三月创造了一部联合采煤机月产一万六千多吨煤的新纪录。至于割煤机的使用情况，更加普遍。现在全国已有二十四个矿务局或煤矿，在不同条件下使用了割煤机采煤。割煤机的效能由一九五零年的每部月产三千二百多吨提高到今年上半年的每部月产七千四百多吨。在井陉、淮南、抚顺、本溪、南桐等煤矿的井下，都已运用电车运输，改变了过去运输落后于采煤的情况。在我国的国营煤矿中，现在已经基本上消灭了自然通风，装设了机械通风设备，地下作业的矿工们，可以呼吸到新鲜空气。在推行机械化采煤比较晚的陕西铜川煤矿，近一年来，也增设了电钻等采煤机械来代替手镐、铁鎯头等落后的手工工具，井下运输也由电溜子等机械代替了人工拉筐或背斗。
    全国国营煤矿工业采用新式机械的结果，不但减轻了工人的体力劳动，并且大大提高了劳动生产率。今年上半年，全国平均每个采煤工人在一天八小时内，可以采出三吨多煤，比一九四九年将近提高两倍。华北区今年第一季度井下工人的生产效率已比一九五零年提高一倍以上。焦作矿务局自从使用了阮孟武工程师创制的电扒联合装煤机装煤以后，每装满一个载重二十吨车皮的煤，只须五分钟，工作效率比人力装火车提高了五十倍。
    全国国营煤矿生产的机械化程度几年来虽有很大提高，但是距离国家要求还是很远。由于部分干部对推行机械化生产的重要性认识不足和苏联先进经验没有很好推广，以致机械设备的效能没有充分发挥，有些设备被闲置起来不用或任意毁坏。中央人民政府燃料工业部煤矿管理总局为进一步提高煤矿生产的机械化程度，在今年八月二日召开了全国煤矿第一次机械化会议，总结了几年来全国煤矿推行机械化生产的经验，并且批判了某些干部对于推行机械化生产方面的几种错误思想，要求各矿今后必须提高已有机械设备的利用率，充分发挥机械的效能，提高职工的技术水平，争取消灭机电事故，保证生产任务的全面完成。　（新华社）
