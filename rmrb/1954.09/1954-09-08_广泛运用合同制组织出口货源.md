    Widely Employ the Contract System to Organize Export Goods
    The experience of the Northwest Branch of the China Native Produce Export Company in using the contract system to organize export goods proves that: state-owned foreign trade departments, based on state plans, can entrust local trading companies and cooperatives to purchase export agricultural and sideline native products through contract arrangements. This can overcome the difficulties of the foreign trade departments' current limited number of institutions and manpower while the purchasing areas are dispersed. It can complete export tasks and promote the improvement of business management by relevant parties who signed the contract.
    The entrusted purchasing contract signed between foreign trade departments and local trading companies and cooperatives is an organized and planned economic activity. It has clear regulations on the quantity, price, specifications, delivery locations, and payment methods of goods. This allows for the full utilization of the relevant departments' strength to strengthen the purchasing work of export materials, and makes it possible for all work links such as purchasing, processing, storage, and transportation to be carried out according to the established plan, achieving the goal of balanced purchasing and balanced transportation, reducing inventory backlogs and transportation waste. At the same time, it can avoid abnormal phenomena such as farmers selling products too crowdedly or intermittently due to busy and slack farming seasons.
    However, at present, not every leading cadre in the state-owned foreign trade system can deeply understand the great significance and role of the contract system. Some units do not rely on cooperatives and rely solely on their own retail purchases; some units, although they have signed entrusted purchasing contracts with cooperatives, believe that signing the contract is "all done and dusted", and do not provide specific assistance and technical guidance to cooperatives. When purchasing units improperly handle the acquisition price and specification requirements, it affects the completion of the purchasing task. Some because the responsibilities of both parties to the contract are not clearly defined, when problems occur, they shirk responsibility to each other, which also affects the completion of the task and the relationship between the two parties.
    In order to overcome the above shortcomings and actively promote the contract system, first of all, state-owned foreign trade departments must establish the idea of ​​relying closely on local trading companies and cooperatives. It is necessary to realize that this is of great significance for consolidating the socialist position in rural areas and is an important measure to ensure the completion of the task of purchasing export materials. Cooperative cadres should also realize that only by closely relying on the state-owned economy can we seek stable business development, so that both parties can work together to complete the task.
    Secondly, state-owned trading departments and cooperatives must strictly implement the contract. It should be recognized that the contract not only marks a planned and organized exchange, but in essence, such a contract system is a socialist economic connection, and the promotion of the contract system means the growth of socialist factors in the commercial field. Contracts are of a legal nature, and relevant departments must sign them carefully, strictly abide by contract credit, resolutely fulfill the obligations stipulated in the contract, and prevent the phenomenon of reluctantly signing contracts or adopting a laissez-faire attitude towards contracts, making careless changes, or even arbitrarily invalidating them. Industrial and commercial administrative departments at all levels must also regularly inspect and supervise the implementation of contracts, and promptly make serious and appropriate handling of problems that occur, in order to consolidate the normal exchange order between urban and rural areas and ensure the completion of the national trade plan. Both parties signing the contract should also overcome departmentalism and promote the spirit of seeking truth from facts. When problems are encountered, both parties should negotiate to resolve them or request local party and government assistance to resolve them.
    Thirdly, the contract must be concluded on the most reliable basis. It is necessary to coordinate plans from top to bottom and inside and outside based on production and demand, and then sign contracts and organize production based on the plan to ensure supply. After the contract is signed, the relevant departments must closely contact and, in accordance with the contract stipulations, guide and organize production, procurement, and processing in a timely and planned manner according to the production and sales conditions of different commodities. In this way, the contract is signed based on the plan, and the plan is realized due to the accurate execution of the contract. In this way, the planning of production and sales can be strengthened.
    In addition, the contract terms should be as specific and clear as possible to avoid ambiguous wording and ambiguous clauses, so as to reduce disputes during handover and facilitate both parties to handle affairs in accordance with the contract.

### 广泛运用合同制组织出口货源

    广泛运用合同制组织出口货源
    中国土产出口公司西北分公司运用合同制组织出口货源的经验证明：国营对外贸易部门根据国家计划，采取合同制的办法，委托地方贸易公司和合作社代购出口农副土特产品，可以克服对外贸易部门目前机构少、力量不足而收购地区分散的困难，完成出口任务，并推动签订合同的有关方面改善经营管理。
    对外贸易部门与地方贸易公司、合作社订立的委托代购合同，是一种有组织有计划的经济行为，对商品的数量、价格、规格、交接地点、付款方法等都有明确规定，这样，就可充分发挥有关部门的力量，加强出口物资的收购工作，并使收购、加工、储运等各个工作环节有可能按既定计划进行，达到均衡收购与均衡运输的目的，减少库存积压和运输浪费的现象；同时可避免因农忙农闲而造成农民出售产品过于拥挤或间断的不正常现象。
    但在目前，国营对外贸易系统中并不是每一个分支机构的领导干部都能深刻了解合同制的重大意义和作用的。有的单位不依靠合作社，单靠自己的门市收购；有的单位虽与合作社订了委托代购合同，但认为订了合同就“万事大吉”，不对合作社进行具体帮助和技术指导，遇到收购单位对收购价格、规格规定掌握不妥时，就影响了收购任务的完成；有的因合同双方的责任规定不够明确，发生问题时互相推诿，也影响到任务的完成和双方的关系。
    为了克服以上缺点，积极推广合同制，首先，国营对外贸易部门必须树立紧紧依靠地方贸易公司和合作社的思想。要认识这对巩固社会主义在农村的阵地，具有重大的意义。也是保证完成收购出口物资的重要措施。合作社干部也应认识只有密切依靠国营经济，才能求得业务稳固的发展，从而双方同心协力，共同完成任务。
    其次，国营贸易部门与合作社必须严格执行合同。应认识合同不但标志着有计划有组织的交流，而在实质上，这样的合同制是社会主义的经济联系，合同制的推广就是意味着社会主义因素在商业领域中的增长。合同是具有法律性质的，有关部门必须认真签订，严格遵守合同信用，坚决执行合同所规定的义务，防止勉强订立合同或对合同采取自流不管、轻率变动，甚至随便作废的现象。各级工商行政部门也要经常检查督促合同的执行，发生问题须及时作严肃适当的处理，以巩固正常的城乡内外交流秩序，保证国家贸易计划的完成。签订合同双方也应克服本位主义思想，发扬实事求是精神，遇到问题双方应协商解决，或请求当地党政协助解决。
    第三，合同必须订立在最可靠的基础之上。要根据生产及需求情况，作到上下内外计划衔接，然后再以计划为依据，签订合同，组织生产，以保证供应。合同签订后，有关部门就须密切联系，按合同规定，分别不同商品的产销情况，及时地有计划地指导与组织生产、收购和加工。这样，合同是以计划为根据而签订，而计划则因合同的准确执行而实现，这样，就可以加强产销的计划性。
    此外，合同条款要力求具体明确，避免模棱两可的字句和解释多端的条文，以减少交接中的纠纷，便于双方按照合同办事。
