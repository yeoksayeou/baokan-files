    (I) Celebrating the Tenth Anniversary of Bulgaria's Liberation

    Today marks the tenth anniversary of Bulgaria's liberation. Ten years ago, on this day, with the support of the Soviet army's victorious march into the Balkans, the Bulgarian people overthrew the royal fascist rule, established their own people's regime, and began the struggle to build a new social system. When talking about the great historical significance of the "September 9th Uprising," the outstanding leader of the Bulgarian people, Georgi Dimitrov, once pointed out: "The September 9th Uprising, which won victory with the decisive help of the heroic Red Army, cleared the way for our country to build socialism."

    The liberation of Bulgaria and other countries in Southeast Europe is one of the most important results of World War II. These countries, which were formerly objects of imperialist plunder and tools of aggression, have inevitably greatly weakened the war power of imperialism and benefited the cause of human struggle for social progress and world peace since they broke away from the world capitalist system and embarked on the road of socialist development. Over the past decade, Bulgaria, like other people's democratic countries, has developed and consolidated on the road to building socialism. The development and consolidation of people's democratic countries is a major victory for the world's forces of peace and democracy.

    Over the past decade, the Bulgarian people have experienced a glorious path. The Bulgarian people have not only eliminated the remnants of fascism, crushed the conspiracies of the bourgeoisie and imperialism, and defended the victorious fruits of the armed uprising, but also achieved significant achievements in the development of the national economy, thereby greatly changing the face of the country. Bulgaria's first five-year plan has been completed one year ahead of schedule, and the second five-year plan began in 1953. In 1953, the total value of state-owned industrial production increased by 3.4 times compared with the pre-war period, and the socialist economy has occupied an absolute dominant position in the entire industry. Comrade Chervenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Bulgaria, pointed out at the Sixth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party: "Bulgaria has laid the foundation for socialism, and has created conditions for our country to develop rapidly along the road of socialism and greatly improve the material and cultural living standards of the working people." Bulgaria's achievements in developing agriculture are also significant. In 1952, agricultural producers' cooperatives accounted for more than 60 percent of the country's cultivated land. Due to the rapid progress of agricultural collectivization, Bulgaria's grain and major industrial crop production has exceeded pre-war levels. On the basis of national economic development, the lives of the Bulgarian people are flourishing.

    The achievements made by the Bulgarian people over the past decade are inseparable from the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party. The Bulgarian Communist Party takes the invincible Marxism-Leninism as its guide to action, learns from the brilliant example and rich experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and smoothly solves various major and complex problems encountered in the process of building socialism in Bulgaria. The Bulgarian Communist Party has won the trust and love of the Bulgarian people with its actions of loyalty to the people and the cause of socialism. In the struggle to lead the people to overcome difficulties and strive for socialist victory, the Bulgarian Communist Party has become more consolidated ideologically and organizationally. The Sixth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party, held in February and March this year, demonstrated the unity of the Bulgarian Communist Party. The Bulgarian Communist Party is a reliable guarantee for the Bulgarian people to successfully complete socialist construction.

    The Bulgarian Communist Party and the Bulgarian government embody the Bulgarian people's will to love peace, and have been striving to consolidate peace, promote international cooperation, and enhance friendship between peoples of all countries over the years. Friendly unity with the great socialist country of the Soviet Union is the primary task of Bulgaria's foreign policy. As Comrade Chervenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Bulgaria, said: Soviet-Bulgarian friendship is "the sunshine and air for Bulgaria's national independence, the foundation for the people's progress, freedom, and happiness, and the foundation for the socialist development of our motherland." Under the common goal of defending peace and building socialism, Bulgaria's relations with other people's democratic countries have also greatly developed. The government and people of the People's Republic of Bulgaria resolutely oppose the evil policy of the United States to revive German militarism, and fully support the Soviet Union's reasonable proposal on the establishment of European collective security and the peaceful settlement of the German question. The People's Republic of Bulgaria, together with the Soviet Union, people's democratic countries, and peace-loving forces around the world, strives to resolve international disputes through consultation and to achieve peaceful coexistence among countries with different social systems. In the past year or so, the Bulgarian government has signed trade agreements with many capitalist countries, and has repeatedly expressed its readiness to improve its relations with capitalist countries in the Balkan Peninsula. The sincere desire and efforts of the government and people of the People's Republic of Bulgaria to maintain peace and promote international cooperation play an important role in consolidating world peace.

    The friendship between the Chinese and Bulgarian people has long existed. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the friendship between the two peoples has become even more unbreakable. When Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central People's Government of our country, accepted the credentials presented by the newly appointed Bulgarian Ambassador to our country, Dimov, on September 2 this year, he pointed out in his reply:

    "The fraternal friendship between the People's Republic of China and the People's Republic of Bulgaria, and the close cooperation in the political, economic, and cultural fields, have achieved great development. This not only promotes the prosperity and happiness of the two peoples, but also strengthens the world's peace and democratic forces headed by the great Soviet Union."

    "The brilliant achievements made by the Bulgarian people in the cause of socialist construction under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party in the ten years after liberation have inspired the labor enthusiasm of the Chinese people who are engaged in socialist construction and socialist transformation."

    Today, as we celebrate the tenth anniversary of Bulgaria's National Day, our country, at the invitation of the Bulgarian government, has sent a government delegation headed by Comrade Dong Biwu, Vice Premier of the State Council of the Central People's Government, to Sofia to participate in the celebration. At the same time, according to the 1954 implementation plan of the Sino-Bulgarian cultural cooperation agreement, Lieutenant General Diako Diakov of the Bulgarian People's Army and the Song and Dance Troupe of the Bulgarian People's Army have also come to our country for visits and performances. This fully demonstrates the continuous enhancement of friendship and sincere feelings between the Chinese and Bulgarian people.

    The Chinese people warmly celebrate the great festival of the tenth anniversary of Bulgaria's liberation. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party and with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, the Bulgarian people will surely achieve greater achievements in the cause of building socialism and defending peace in the future.

    （一）庆祝保加利亚解放十周年
    今天是保加利亚解放十周年。十年前的这一天，保加利亚人民在苏联军队胜利进军巴尔干半岛的配合之下，推翻了保皇法西斯的统治，建立了人民自己的政权，并开始了建设新社会制度的斗争。保加利亚人民的杰出领袖格·季米特洛夫在谈到“九九起义”的伟大历史意义的时候，曾经指出：“九九起义既得有英勇红军决定性的帮助而获得胜利，就为我国建设社会主义扫清了道路。”
    保加利亚和东南欧其他国家的获得解放，是第二次世界大战的最重要的结果之一。这些从前作为帝国主义掠夺对象和侵略工具的国家，既然脱离了世界资本主义体系而走上了向社会主义发展的道路，就不可避免地大大地削弱了帝国主义的战争力量而有利于人类争取社会进步和世界和平的事业。十年来，保加利亚和其他人民民主国家一样，在建设社会主义的道路上发展和巩固了。人民民主国家的发展和巩固是世界和平民主力量的重大胜利。
    十年来，保加利亚人民经历了光辉的道路。保加利亚人民不仅肃清了法西斯主义的残余，粉碎了资产阶级和帝国主义的阴谋，保卫住了武装起义的胜利成果，并且在发展国民经济的工作中取得了重大的成就，从而大大地改变了国家的面貌。保加利亚第一个五年计划已经提前一年完成，并从一九五三年起开始了第二个五年计划。一九五三年国营工业生产总值已较战前增加三点四倍，社会主义经济已经在整个工业中占有绝对统治地位。保加利亚部长会议主席契尔文科夫同志在保共第六次代表大会上指出：“保加利亚已经奠定了社会主义的基础，已为我国沿着社会主义的道路迅速发展、为大大提高劳动人民的物质和文化生活水平创造了条件。”保加利亚在发展农业方面的成就也是显著的。一九五二年农业生产合作社所占的耕地面积已占全国耕地的百分之六十以上。由于农业合作化的迅速进展，保加利亚的谷物和主要技术作物的生产量已超过了战前的水平。在国民经济发展的基础上，保加利亚人民的生活正在蒸蒸日上。
    保加利亚人民十年来所取得的成就，和保加利亚共产党的领导是分不开的。保加利亚共产党以战无不胜的马克思列宁主义为自己的行动指针，学习着苏联共产党的光辉榜样和丰富经验，顺利地解决了在保加利亚建设社会主义进程中所遇到的各项重大而复杂的问题。保加利亚共产党以自己忠于人民和社会主义事业的行动，赢得了保加利亚人民的信任和爱戴。在领导人民克服困难、争取社会主义胜利的斗争中，保加利亚共产党在思想上和组织上更加巩固起来了。今年二、三月间举行的保共第六次代表大会，表现了保加利亚共产党的团结一致。保加利亚共产党是保加利亚人民胜利完成社会主义建设的可靠保证。
    保加利亚共产党和保加利亚政府体现着保加利亚人民热爱和平的意志，这些年来一直为巩固和平、增进国际合作和各国人民之间的友谊而奋斗。同伟大的社会主义国家苏联的友好团结，是保加利亚对外政策的首要任务。正如保加利亚部长会议主席契尔文科夫同志所说的：保苏友谊是“保加利亚民族独立的阳光和空气，人民进步、自由和幸福的基础，我们祖国社会主义发展的基础”。在保卫和
  平和建设社会主义的共同目标之下，保加利亚和各
  人民民主国家的关系也有了极大的发展。保加利亚人民共和国政府和人民坚决反对美国复活德国军国主义的罪恶政策，全力支持苏联提出的关于建立欧洲集体安全及和平解决德国问题的合理主张。保加利亚人民共和国和苏联、各人民民主国家以及全世界爱好和平的力量一道，为争取以协商方式解决国际争端、争取不同社会制度的国家的和平共处而努力。近一年多以来，保加利亚政府同不少的资本主义国家签订了贸易协定，并且一再表示准备改善它和巴尔干半岛各资本主义国家的关系。保加利亚人民共和国政府和人民维护和平和促进国际合作的真诚愿望和努力，对于巩固世界和平有着重要的作用。
    中国人民和保加利亚人民之间的友谊早就存在。在中华人民共和国成立之后，两国人民的友谊更加牢不可破了。我国中央人民政府主席毛泽东同志在今年九月二日保加利亚新任驻我国大使迪莫夫呈递国书的时候，在致答词中指出：
    “中华人民共和国和保加利亚人民共和国之间兄弟般的友谊，在政治、经济、文化各方面的密切合作，已获得了极大的发展。这不但促进了两国人民的繁荣和幸福，并加强了以伟大苏联为首的世界和平民主力量。”
    “保加利亚人民在解放后的十年中，在保加利亚共产党的领导下，在社会主义建设事业中所获得的光辉成就，鼓舞了正在从事社会主义建设和社会主义改造的中国人民的劳动热情。”
    在庆祝保加利亚十周年国庆的今天，我国应保加利亚政府的邀请，派遣了以中央人民政府政务院副总理董必武同志为首的政府代表团前往索非亚参加庆祝典礼。同时，根据中保文化合作协定一九五四年执行计划，保加利亚人民军迪亚科·迪亚科夫中将和保加利亚人民军歌舞团，也来到我国进行访问和演出。这充分显示了中保两国人民之间友谊的不断增进和相互之间的真挚感情。
    中国人民热烈庆祝保加利亚解放十周年这个伟大的节日。我们坚决相信：在保加利亚共产党的领导下，在苏联的无私援助下，保加利亚人民在今后建设社会主义和保卫和平的事业中必将取得更大的成就。
