Xinhua News Agency, London, September 14th: According to TASS, British Foreign Secretary Eden is visiting Western European capitals after the failure of the "European Defense Community." On the 13th, Eden flew from Bonn to Rome.

Eden held talks with Chancellor Adenauer in Bonn, after which a joint communiqué was issued on the 13th. The communiqué stated that Eden and Adenauer were in "complete agreement" on the European situation. The communiqué went on to say that they discussed the issue of restoring German "sovereignty" and "possible solutions" for West Germany's participation in Western "defense." It is known that the so-called "granting West Germany sovereignty" and "making Germany contribute to defense," advocated by those who want to revive German militarism, is to arm West Germany without restrictions.

It can be seen from the communiqué that the participants in the Bonn talks put forward views on the German issue that have been resolutely opposed in France. French social figures will obviously not be reassured by the additional condition in the communiqué: that the solution to the issue of arming West Germany should be based on a solid understanding between France and Germany.

The "Times" Washington correspondent said, "No one believes it's a coincidence that U.S. Deputy Undersecretary of State Robert Murphy was hurriedly sent to visit European capitals immediately after Eden." The correspondent said, "Some people believe that Murphy's hasty trip is at least to find out what Eden's talks foreshadow." The reporter went on to say: "Murphy will visit Europe for two weeks. He is said to be holding talks in London, Paris, Bonn, Rome, and possibly other European capitals. No one has explained why Murphy's trip is being kept secret. The general reaction in the United States to the failure of the European Defense Community can be summarized as the opinion that European countries should take the initiative to find other ways to incorporate German armed forces into the Western defense alliance."

According to a Paris dispatch, "Combat" believes that the dispatch of Murphy to visit Western European capitals after Eden is a manifestation of the "struggle for power" between the United States and Britain on the issue of arming West Germany.

"L'Humanité" severely criticized the British government's conspiracy to find a "new plan" to establish an aggressive military group in Europe with an armed West Germany participating. "L'Humanité" said: Arming revanchist Germany is sinful. Doing so would create insurmountable obstacles to resolving the German issue, that is, to resolving the issue of European peace.

### 艾登在波恩和阿登纳会谈  美国政府派墨菲也去西欧活动

    艾登在波恩和阿登纳会谈
    美国政府派墨菲也去西欧活动
   【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国外交大臣艾登在“欧洲防务集团”失败后，访问西欧各国首都。十三日，艾登从波恩飞到罗马。
    艾登在波恩和阿登纳总理举行了会谈，会谈后在十三日发表了一个联合公报。公报说，艾登和阿登纳对欧洲局势问题“意见完全一致”。公报接着说，他们讨论了恢复德国“主权”的问题和使西德参加西方“防务”的“可能解决办法”。大家知道，主张复活德国军国主义的人所谓“给予西德主权”和“使德国对防务作出贡献”，就是要无限制地武装西德。
    从公报中可以看出，波恩会谈的参加者在德国问题上提出了在法国遭到坚决反对的观点。法国社会人士显然不会因公报中这样一个附加条件而放心，这个条件就是：解决武装西德问题应以法德两国的牢固的谅解作基础。
    “泰晤士报”驻华盛顿记者说：“美国副国务卿帮办罗伯特·墨菲急忙被派紧跟着艾登之后去访问欧洲各国首都，谁也不认为这是一种巧合。”这个记者说：“有些人认为墨菲的仓卒出行至少是为了要弄清楚艾登的会谈预示着什么。”记者接着又说：“墨菲要在欧洲访问两个星期。据说他要在伦敦、巴黎、波恩、罗马，并且可能在欧洲其他国家的首都，进行会谈。没有人说明为什么对墨菲之行保持秘密。欧洲防务集团的失败在美国所引起的普遍反应可以归结成这样一种意见：欧洲国家应当发挥主动性，找出把德国武装力量纳入西方防务联盟的其他办法来。”
    据巴黎消息，“战斗报”认为墨菲被派跟踪艾登之后去访问西欧各国首都一事，是美、英两国在武装西德问题上“争权”的表现。
    “人道报”严厉抨击英国政府阴谋寻找“新方案”在欧洲建立一个有武装起来的西德参加的侵略军事集团。“人道报”说：武装复仇主义的德国是罪恶的。如果这样做，就会为解决德国问题，也就是为解决欧洲和平问题，造成不可克服的障碍。
