Following the issuance of the directive on increasing oil crop production in the winter of 1953, the planting area of oil crops in various regions expanded, and the output also increased. However, the increase in oil crop production has not kept pace with the growing demand for edible oil, and the supply of edible oil is still insufficient. In order to ensure a greater supply of edible oil to meet the needs of the people nationwide in 1955, all regions are once again instructed to mobilize farmers, in a planned and organized manner, to increase the planting of oil crops suitable for growth based on local soil, climate, and other conditions. Specific measures are now stipulated as follows:

	I. In areas with concentrated oil crop production, farmers who already grow oil crops are required to continue to increase oil production in large quantities in accordance with the national plan, strive to increase the yield per unit area, and, without affecting the planting plans for grain, cotton, and other crops, increase the planting of oil crops as much as possible; they are required to sell more oil to the state than in the past, after retaining enough for their own consumption and necessary seeds.

	In general oil crop production areas, farmers who already grow oil crops are required to expand the planting area of oil crops in accordance with the national plan and to sell a certain amount of oil to the state, after retaining enough for their own consumption and necessary seeds.

	Within the above two types of areas, farmers who have not grown oil crops in the past are required to squeeze out a small amount of land to plant oil crops, on the basis of no more than one fen (one-tenth of a mu) per person, without excessively reducing the planting area of other crops, with the aim of first achieving self-sufficiency in edible oil and seeds for the coming year in each village and household after the oil crop harvest next year, and then striving to sell the surplus oil to the state.

	In a few areas where it is truly impossible to grow oil crops, farmers should not be forced to plant them. In these areas, the difficulty of farmers obtaining edible oil, which needs to be resolved, should be addressed by state commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives by providing an appropriate supply according to the local farmers' edible oil habits.

	II. In order to stabilize the planting area of grain and cotton and prevent the excessive reduction of the grain and cotton area due to the expansion of oil crop planting, the south should make full use of winter fallow fields to grow more rapeseed, the north should make full use of sandy and barren land to grow peanuts, and the intercropping of oil crops should be promoted in major autumn crops. All regions should make full use of vacant land along fields, embankments, roadsides, ditches, and houses to plant suitable oil crops such as sunflowers, castor beans, sesame, and soybeans as much as possible.

	The agricultural departments of all provinces should actively develop the production of edible and industrial woody oil crops in mountainous areas and vigorously organize the masses in mountainous areas to plant walnuts, oil tea, Chinese pepper, tallow trees, and tung trees in large quantities according to local conditions; and develop the production of oil palm, coconut, and other crops in subtropical regions.

	III. Each province should formulate oil crop production increase plans for its jurisdiction based on the control figures stipulated by the State Planning Commission and the Central Ministry of Agriculture, and discuss and deploy them at the people's congresses of each county, district, and township, mobilizing agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams to lead the vast number of farmers in formulating oil crop production plans.

	IV. The supply and marketing cooperatives may process oil crops for farmers' own use or exchange oil for oil crops with the cooperatives. In areas where the processing capacity of supply and marketing cooperatives is insufficient, private oil mills that have been approved and registered by the government are allowed to accept oil crops for farmers' own use for processing, under the supervision of cooperatives entrusted by the state.

	V. The state will continue to implement planned procurement of oil crops, and farmers must sell to the state in accordance with the quantity and price stipulated by the state. After the state's oil crop procurement plan is completed, if farmers have a surplus of oil crops left for their own use that needs to be sold, the supply and marketing cooperatives may continue to purchase them, and farmers are allowed to exchange surplus oil crops in the grain market under the leadership of the state, but private merchants are not allowed to participate in the operation.

### 中央人民政府政务院  关于发动农民增加油料作物生产的指示

    中央人民政府政务院
    关于发动农民增加油料作物生产的指示
    自一九五三年冬季发布增产油料作物指示后，各地油料作物种植面积较前扩大，产量亦有增加。但是油料产量的增加赶不上人民食油需要的增长，食油仍感供不应求。为了保证一九五五年有更多的食油供应全国人民的需要，特再责成各地有计划、有组织地发动农民根据当地土壤、气候等条件增植适宜生长的油料作物。现规定具体办法如下：
    一、在油料作物集中的产区，要求已种油料的农民继续按照国家计划大量增产油料，极力争取提高单位面积产量，并在不影响粮、棉和其他农作物的种植计划的前提下，尽可能地增加种植油料作物；要求他们除自己食用和留下必要的种子外，保证以较过去更多的油料卖给国家。
    在油料作物一般产区，要求已种油料的农民按照国家计划扩大油料作物的种植面积，除自己食用和必要的种子外，还能以一定数量的油料卖给国家。
    在上述两种地区内，要求过去没有种植油料作物的农民，在不过分挤缩其他农作物种植面积的前提下，按照每人不超过一分地（一亩的十分之一）的标准，挤出少量土地来种植油料作物，以期在明年油料收获以后，首先做到各村各户食油和来年种子的自给，进而争取以多余的油料卖给国家。
    在少数确实不能种植油料作物的地区，不得强迫农民种植。在这些地区，农民食油的困难，需要解决，应由国家商业部门和供销合作部门按当地农民食油的习惯予以适当供应。
    二、为了稳定粮棉等种植面积，防止因扩大油料种植而过分挤缩粮棉面积，南方应充分利用冬闲田多种油菜，北方应充分利用沙荒瘠薄土地种植花生，并在大秋作物中提倡间种油料作物。各地均应充分利用田边、地埂、路傍、沟沿、宅园等隙地，尽力种植向日葵、蓖麻、芝麻、大豆等适宜生长的油料作物。
    各省农业部门应积极在山区发展食用的和工业用的木本油料的生产，并大力组织山区群众，因地制宜地大量种植核桃、油茶、花椒、乌桕、油桐等；在亚热带地区发展油棕、椰子等生产。
    三、各省应根据国家计划委员会和中央农业部规定的控制数字，制订辖区内的油料增产计划，并在各县、区、乡人民代表大会上进行讨论和布置，发动各农业生产合作社、互助组，带动广大农民，订立油料生产计划。
    四、对农民自用的油料，可由供销合作社代为加工，或由农民以油料向合作社换油。在供销合作社加工力量不足的地区，允许经政府批准登记的私营油坊，在国家所委托的合作社监督的条件下，接受农民自用的油料代为加工。
    五、国家继续实行油料的计划收购，农民必须按照国家规定的数量和价格，卖给国家。国家收购油料计划完成后，农民留作自用的油料如有节余需要出售时，可由供销合作社继续收购，并允许农民在由国家领导的粮食市场中，以多余油料互通有无，但是不准私商参加经营。
