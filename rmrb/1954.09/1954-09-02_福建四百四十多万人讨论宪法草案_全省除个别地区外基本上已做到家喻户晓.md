    Fujian Province has had more than 5,290,000 people listen to reports on the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, of which more than 4,415,500 have participated in discussions, raising more than 50,000 suggestions for revision.
    During the discussion period, more than 4,000 reporters and more than 52,000 propagandists throughout Fujian Province gave nearly 50,000 reports to the people; in addition, more than 12,000 people's representatives from 70 counties and cities and the people's representatives who had just attended the first session of the First People's Congress of Fujian Province also conveyed the resolutions of the provincial, county, and city people's congresses on supporting the Draft Constitution to the voters. Except for a few individual areas, the whole province basically has achieved universal awareness.
    The publicity and discussion of the Draft Constitution has promoted production and support for the front lines of coastal defense in various places. After discussing the Draft Constitution, workers in many state-owned factories throughout the province launched labor competitions and technological innovation movements. Liu Yongtong, an advanced worker at the Xiamen Machinery Factory, is actively researching and creating a "standard tool for the angle of turning tools," and he wants to use this creation to welcome the birth of the Constitution. Lin Pingjin, a young worker at the Zhangzhou Agricultural Tool Factory, improved the "three-layer turning tool" for turning gears, doubling work efficiency. More than 600 agricultural production mutual aid teams in Gutian County are actively creating conditions in preparation for establishing agricultural production cooperatives after the autumn harvest. When discussing the Draft Constitution, the heroic people of Dongshan Island resolutely stated that they would heighten their vigilance, consolidate coastal defense, support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan, and defend their beloved motherland.

    福建四百四十多万人讨论宪法草案
    全省除个别地区外基本上已做到家喻户晓
    福建省到目前为止已有五百二十九万多人听了中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告，其中有四百四十一万五千五百多人参加了讨论，共提出了五万多条修改意见。
    在展开讨论活动期间，福建全省有四千多名报告员和五万二千多名宣传员向人民群众作了近五万次报告；此外七十个县、市的一万二千多名人民代表及刚刚参加过福建省第一届人民代表大会第一次会议的人民代表，也纷纷向选民传达了省、县、市人民代表大会会议关于拥护宪法草案的决议。全省除个别地区外，基本上已做到家喻户晓。
    宪法草案的宣传和讨论，推动了各地生产和支援海防前线的工作。全省许多地方国营工厂职工在讨论宪法草案后，开展了劳动竞赛和技术革新运动。厦门机器厂先进工人刘永通，正在积极研究创造“车刀角度标准”工具，他要以这个创造来迎接宪法的诞生。漳州农具厂青年工人林萍津改进了车齿轮的“三层车刀”，使工作效率提高了一倍。古田县六百多个农业生产互助组，正在积极创造条件，准备秋后建立农业生产合作社。英雄的东山岛人民在讨论宪法草案时坚决表示：要提高警惕、巩固海防，支援人民解放军解放台湾，保卫可爱的祖国。（新华社）
