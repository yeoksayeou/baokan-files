    The current supply of edible oil nationwide still cannot meet the needs of the people, especially in rural areas where the edible oil supply is too small. This is an important issue that must be addressed. The directive issued by the State Council of the Central People's Government on the 19th of this month regarding mobilizing farmers to increase the production of oil crops is very important and timely. All localities must earnestly implement it in order to fundamentally and gradually solve the problem of insufficient edible oil supply in our country.
    Why is the edible oil supply so low? Aside from the general improvement in people's living standards since liberation, and the fact that the production of industrial and agricultural daily necessities generally cannot keep up with the growth of social purchasing power, the basic reason is still insufficient oilseed production, which has not yet recovered to its pre-war peak. This is because, during the long period of war, farmers prioritized planting more grain to solve the problem of food shortages, significantly reducing the cultivated area for oil crops. After liberation, the primary task of the People's Government in agricultural production was to concentrate on increasing the production of grain and cotton in order to increase domestic supply and reduce imports of grain and cotton. It was not possible to concentrate efforts on solving the problem of increased oilseed production. Therefore, although oilseed production has increased year by year in recent years, and after the State Council issued a directive to increase oil crop production last December, oilseed production increased even more this year. At the same time, the government has adjusted the purchase prices of oilseeds, and has reduced this year's oilseed export volume as much as possible, in order to increase the national supply of edible oil. The masses in various localities have also proposed many methods to open up oil sources, improve the oil extraction rate of oilseeds, and find substitutes. These measures have all played a certain role in increasing the supply of edible oil. However, compared to the needs, the current oilseed production and edible oil supply are still insufficient.
    Now that the situation of grain and cotton production can be generally stabilized, it has become a very urgent task to expand the area of some oil crops in a planned way and vigorously increase oilseed production. This task is also achievable.
    Our country's climate and soil conditions are suitable for developing oil crops. Soybeans, peanuts, sesame, rapeseed, cottonseed, flaxseed, coconuts, sunflower seeds, etc. can all be produced in large quantities. There is also a considerable amount of arable land in our country that can be sown with oilseeds without affecting grain and cotton production. There are about 80 million mu of winter fallow land in the south. If it is rotated with wheat and green manure, it is entirely possible to sow another 10 to 20 million mu of rapeseed. In the north, there are millions of mu of sandy wasteland that can also be utilized. In coastal areas of Shandong, Hebei, Jiangsu and other provinces, there is still a lot of land that is not suitable for planting grain and cotton but can be planted with sunflowers. In Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi and other provinces, peanuts can be planted in spring and summer, and the planting area can be expanded by using hilly wasteland. In addition, in the vast mountainous areas, woody oil crops for edible and industrial use can also be developed in accordance with local conditions, and a large number of walnuts, oil tea, pepper, tallow trees, tung trees, etc. can be planted. Although these woody crops grow slowly, they are still one of the fundamental ways to increase oilseed production. Developing these woody crops can save arable land and improve the lives of people in mountainous areas, which is a necessary measure to be taken.
    Existing oil crop planting areas also have a lot of potential that can be tapped. According to the experience of the Northeast, if soybean rhizobium is used for seed dressing, the yield of soybeans can be increased by a minimum of 3 percent and a maximum of 70 percent per hectare. A type of rapeseed seed in Sichuan Province has strong disease resistance and its yield is 50 to 150 percent higher than that of local varieties. In some areas, farmers use rhizobium to dress peanut seeds, and generally the yield can be increased by more than 15 percent. Zhang Mayu of Linhe County in the Hetao area of Inner Mongolia planted two mu of flax last year and harvested 310 jin per mu, while the average yield in the entire area was only 36 jin. If we can widely promote these advanced experiences, our oilseed production will increase rapidly.
    Party and government leading organs and agricultural departments at all levels must put the work of increasing oil crop production on the important work agenda, and vigorously lead the masses to increase oilseed production in the same way as they value the production of grain and cotton. They must study the scientific and technological aspects of cultivation, promote advanced experience, and mobilize the broad masses of farmers to quickly overcome this weak link in agricultural production.
    To mobilize farmers to increase oilseed production, it is first necessary to mobilize farmers in concentrated oil crop production areas and general production areas who grow oil crops. They are the main force in producing commercial oilseeds. They must be mobilized to greatly increase oilseed production and expand the planting area of oil crops in accordance with the national plan. They are required to sell more oilseeds to the state to meet the needs of the country, except for the part that they retain for their own use and seeds. However, after all, only a small number of farmers nationwide currently grow oil crops. Therefore, it is also necessary to vigorously mobilize all farmers to grow oilseeds. Except for a few with special difficulties, in areas where oil crops can be grown, farmers who have not grown oilseeds in the past should grow oil crops in every household according to the standard of no more than one fen per person, provided that the planting area of other crops is not excessively squeezed, so as to first achieve self-sufficiency in every village and every household after the harvest next year, no longer relying on the government's supply; and then strive to sell surplus oilseeds to the state. Only in this way can the phenomenon of insufficient edible oil supply be gradually overcome, and the problem of insufficient edible oil supply in rural areas can be further solved.
    Increasing oil crop production is a responsibility that farmers should bear for the improvement of the lives of the people throughout the country (including the farmers themselves) and for the cause of national construction, just as producing fertilizer and new farm tools is a responsibility that workers should bear to the farmers and to the country. Oilseeds come from rural areas, and about two-thirds of the national consumption of edible oil is also in rural areas. To solve the problem of edible oil supply in the vast rural areas, it is impossible to meet the needs entirely by relying on state allocation and adjustment. The only way out is for everyone to take action and every household to be self-sufficient. Farmers should try their best to use the headlands, field edges, and mountain slopes to plant a little more oil crops. This is not very laborious. If you plant one fen of oil crops, such as rapeseed, you can produce more than two jin of oil; sunflower, you can produce more than four jin of oil. This can basically achieve self-sufficiency in edible oil. When the vast majority of farmers have achieved self-sufficiency, the country can use more edible oil to supply the people in cities and industrial and mining areas, supply farmers in a few areas where it is indeed impossible to grow oil crops, and also further meet the needs of national industrialization. This is the important significance of the recent State Council's call on farmers to implement the oilseed production increase plan. All farmers should actively support this method and strive to realize the national production increase plan.
    To increase oil crop production and mobilize farmers to achieve self-sufficiency in edible oil production, many preparations must also be made. This means making production plans in a timely manner, vigorously adjusting seeds, and strengthening technical guidance, etc. At the same time, the problem of processing oilseeds for farmers' own use must also be solved well. After the implementation of the unified purchase of oilseeds and the unified sale of edible oil this year, many oil mills in rural areas have not yet recovered, the organization of the rural primary market is not sound, and some farmers have no place to extract oil or exchange oil with their stored oilseeds. They either use extremely crude methods to refine oil, resulting in a very low edible oil recovery rate, or directly use oilseeds as fertilizer, which is a great waste. In order to solve this problem, the directive of the State Council of the Central People's Government stipulates that supply and marketing cooperatives should be responsible for processing oil extraction for farmers, or helping farmers exchange oilseeds for edible oil. In areas where the processing capacity of supply and marketing cooperatives is insufficient, private oil mills approved by the government are allowed to accept farmers' own-use oilseeds for processing under the supervision of the cooperatives. If this work is done well, it can greatly reduce waste, facilitate farmers' lives, encourage farmers' enthusiasm for production, and also benefit the implementation of the national policy of unified purchase and unified sale.
    As long as we can mobilize the farmers well and implement the specific measures to increase oil crop production, we will definitely be able to overcome the difficulties and gradually improve the situation of insufficient edible oil supply. The sowing season for rapeseed in the south is approaching. It is hoped that the Party committees and government workers at all levels in the southern provinces will take action first, immediately plan, and quickly arrange, so as not to miss the farming season. The provinces and counties in the north should also make early arrangements for sowing oil crops next year. We believe that after the oil crops are harvested next year, the situation of edible oil supply nationwide will definitely be significantly improved.

### 大力增加油料生产，改进食油供应

    大力增加油料生产，改进食油供应
    目前全国食油的供应还不能满足人民的需要，特别是农村食油供应量太少，这是必须注意加以解决的一个重要问题。中央人民政府政务院本月十九日发出的关于发动农民增加油料作物生产的指示，是十分重要的和及时的，各地必须认真执行，以便从根本上逐步解决我国食油供应不足的问题。
    食油供应量为什么少呢？除了解放以来人民生活水平普遍提高，工农业日用品的生产一般地赶不上社会购买力增长的速度以外，基本的原因，还在于油料生产不足，迄今仍未恢复到战前最高水平。这是因为在过去长期战争中，农民为了解决粮食的困难，首先是要多种粮食，油料作物耕种面积缩减很多；解放以后，人民政府在农业生产方面的首要任务是集中力量增加粮食和棉花的生产，以便增加国内供应，减少粮食和棉花的进口，也不可能集中力量解决油料增产的问题。因此，几年来油料产量虽然年年都有增长，而在去年十二月政务院发出增产油料作物的指示后，今年油料生产增加得更多，同时政府又调整了油料的收购价格，尽可能地减少了今年的油料出口数量，来增加全国食油的供应量；各地群众也提出很多办法，开辟油源，提高油料出油率，找寻代用品，这些措施对增加食油供应都起了一定的作用。但是，和需要相比，目前油料的产量和食油的供应量，仍然是不足的。
    现在粮食和棉花生产的状况，大体可以稳定下来，有计划地扩大一部分油料作物面积，大力增产油料，就成了一项十分迫切的任务了。这个任务也是可能完成的。
    我国气候和土壤的条件，都适合于发展油料作物，其中如大豆、花生、芝麻、油菜籽、棉籽、胡麻、椰子、葵花子等，都可以大量生产。我国可以播种油料而不影响粮棉生产的耕地也不少。南方约有八千万亩冬闲田，如果与小麦、绿肥轮栽，再播种一、二千万亩油菜是完全可能的；北方有成百万亩的沙荒，也可以利用；山东、河北、江苏等省沿海地带，还有不少不适于种植粮棉而可以种植向日葵的土地；福建、广东、广西等省春夏都能播种花生，也可利用丘陵荒地扩大种植面积。此外，在广大的山区，还可以因地制宜地发展食用和工业用的木本油料作物，大量种植核桃、油茶、花椒、乌桕、油桐等等，这些木本作物虽然成长较慢，但仍然是增加油料的根本办法之一。发展这些木本作物，既可节省耕地，又可改善山区人民生活，这是必须采取的办法。
    现有油料作物耕种地区，也有不少潜力可以发掘。根据东北的经验，如果采用大豆根瘤菌拌种，每垧地最低可以增产大豆百分之三，最高可以增产百分之七十。四川省的一种油菜种，抗病力强，产量也比当地一般品种要高百分之五十至一百五十。若干地区农民用根瘤菌拌种花生，一般也都能增产百分之十五以上。内蒙古河套区临河县张马玉，去年种胡麻二亩，每亩收三百一十斤，而全区平均产量仅为三十六斤。如果我们能广泛地推广这些先进经验，我们的油料产量，就会很快地增长。
    各地党政领导机关和农业部门，必须把增产油料作物的工作放到重要的工作日程上来，要像重视粮食、棉花的生产一样，大力领导群众增产油料，研究耕作的科学技术，推广先进的经验，把广大农民发动起来，迅速克服农业生产中的这个薄弱环节。
    发动农民增加油料生产，首先是要发动油料作物集中产区和一般产区中种植油料作物的农民。他们是生产商品油料的主力，要动员他们按照国家计划，大量增产油料和扩大油料作物种植面积，要求他们除了留下自用的一部分和种子以外，保证以更多的油料卖给国家，供应国家的需要。但是，目前全国种植油料作物的农民毕竟还占少数，因此还必须大力发动全体农民都种油料。除了少数特殊困难的以外，凡是能种植油料作物的地区，过去没有种植油料的农民，在不过分挤缩其它农作物种植面积的前提下，都应该按照每人不超过一分地的标准，家家户户都种油料作物，以便在明年收获以后，首先做到村村自给，家家自给，不再依赖政府的供应；进而争取以多余的油料卖给国家。只有这样，食油供应不足的现象才会逐渐克服，农村食油供应不足的问题才能进一步解决。
    增产油料作物，是农民对全国人民（包括农民自己在内）生活的改善和对国家建设事业所应负的责任，这也正如生产肥田粉、新农具是工人对农民和对国家应负的责任一样。油料是从农村来的，全国食油的消耗量也约有三分之二是在农村，要解决广大农村食油的供应问题，完全依靠国家调运和调剂是不可能满足需要的，必须人人动手，家家自给，才是出路。农民们应该尽量利用地头、田边、山坡各处加种一点油料作物，这是不很费事的。如果种一分地的油料作物，例如菜子，就可以出油二斤多；向日葵，可出油四斤多。这就基本上能够达到食油自给。而绝大多数的农民如果都作到了自给自足的时候，国家就可以用更多的食油供应城市和工矿地区的人民，供应少数确实不能种植油料作物地区的农民，也能够进一步满足国家工业化的需要。这就是最近政务院号召农民实行油料计划增产的重要意义。全体农民都应该积极拥护这个办法，努力实现国家的增产计划。
    要增加油料作物生产，发动农民做到食油生产自给，还必须做好很多准备工作。这就是要及时作好生产计划，大力调剂种子，加强技术指导等等。同时，对目前农民自用油料的加工问题，也必须很好解决。今年实行油料统购和食油统销后，农村不少的油坊至今还没有恢复，农村初级市场组织还不健全，有些农民所存的油料无处榨油和无处换油，他们或者用极粗糙的办法提炼，食油回收率很低；或者直接将油料当肥料，浪费很大。为了解决这个问题，中央人民政府政务院的指示中规定了供销合作社要负责替农民加工榨油，或者帮助农民以油料换取食油；在供销合作社加工力量不足的地区，允许经过政府批准的私营油坊，在合作社监督下接受农民自用油料代为加工。这件工作作好了，就可以大大减少浪费，便利农民的生活，鼓舞农民的生产热情，也有利于国家统购统销政策的贯彻。
    只要我们能够很好地发动农民，贯彻增加油料作物生产的具体措施，我们就一定能够克服困难，逐步改善食油供应不足的状况。现在南方油菜的播种季节快到了，希望南方各省的各级党委和政府工作人员，首先行动起来，立即筹划，赶快布置，勿失农时。北方各省、县，也应该为明年播种油料作物，早作安排。我们相信，等到明年油料作物收获以后，全国食油供应的状况，一定会有显著的改进。
