Xinhua News Agency, Beirut: According to a TASS report from Beirut, the Lebanese "Al-Telegraph" published on the 11th a joint statement signed by 150 prominent figures from Lebanese cultural, scientific, and religious circles, demanding that the Lebanese government reject the US proposal to provide Lebanon with military "aid."

The joint statement said that the Lebanese people firmly reject any form and any name of imperialist military alliance and express a fervent hope for peaceful coexistence, consolidation of independence, and international cooperation. However, the dangers of these imperialist alliances continue to seriously threaten our country. We see that the United States' interference in our internal affairs has recently intensified. The purpose of this interference is to force Lebanon to accept US military "aid." US military "aid" will force Lebanon to assume political obligations that endanger its independence and sovereignty, obligations that make it possible for foreign troops to occupy Lebanese territory. As for the consequences of the United States establishing economic domination in Lebanon, plundering its resources, and impoverishing its residents, that goes without saying.

The statement said that the easing of the international situation after the signing of the Indochina armistice agreement has strengthened the Lebanese people's determination to fight to eliminate the imperialist dangers threatening our country.

The Lebanese people demand that national leaders reject the US military "aid" proposal and demand that they take a stand that safeguards our country's independence and sovereignty.

    黎巴嫩文化科学界和宗教界人士发表联合声明
    要求黎巴嫩政府拒绝接受美国军事“援助”
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社贝鲁特讯：黎巴嫩“电讯报”十一日刊载了由黎巴嫩文化科学界和宗教界著名人士一百五十人签名的联合声明，要求黎巴嫩政府拒绝美国给予黎巴嫩军事“援助”的建议。
    联合声明说，黎巴嫩人民坚决拒绝任何形式和任何名称的帝国主义军事同盟，并表示热烈希望和平共处，巩固独立和国际合作。然而这些帝国主义同盟的危险继续严重地威胁着我国。我们看到，美国对我国内部事务的干涉最近加紧了。这种干涉的目的是强迫黎巴嫩接受美国的军事“援助”。美国的军事“援助”将强迫黎巴嫩承担危害它的独立和主权的政治性义务，这种义务使外国军队可能占领黎巴嫩的领土。至于美国在黎巴嫩建立经济统治、劫掠它的资源和使居民贫困化等后果，那就更不待说了。
    声明说，印度支那停战协定签订后所出现的国际局势的缓和，加强了黎巴嫩人民为消除威胁着我国的帝国主义危险而斗争的决心。
    黎巴嫩人民要求国家负责人拒绝美国军事“援助”的建议，并要求他们采取维护我国的独立和主权的立场。
