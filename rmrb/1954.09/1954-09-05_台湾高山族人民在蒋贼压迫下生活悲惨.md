Xinhua News Agency, September 4th:

    Taiwan's Gaoshan compatriots live a very miserable life under the brutal oppression of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. Under the slogan of so-called "leveling the mountain areas with the plains," the Chiang bandit gang implements a policy of national oppression, forcing the Gaoshan people to change their original languages, customs, and religious beliefs. According to Chiang bandit newspapers, American and Chiang bandit "missionaries" have penetrated deeply into Gaoshan areas, forcing the Gaoshan people to abandon their own religious beliefs. The Chiang bandit gang also forces the Gaoshan people to speak Chinese; those who do not speak Chinese are doubly discriminated against. Many Gaoshan women are also forced to wear Han clothing.
    The Gaoshan people are subjected to cruel plunder and exploitation. The Chiang bandit gang blockades the vast forests of the Gaoshan areas, monopolizing logging in order to transport timber abroad and seek exorbitant profits. If Gaoshan people go to the forest to pick up or intercept firewood, they are charged with the crime of indiscriminately felling forests and taken away to be fined or imprisoned. As a result, the Gaoshan people living in the forest areas now lack firewood. The Chiang bandit gang also set up so-called "Mountain Area Materials Supply and Marketing Cooperatives" in various Gaoshan villages, forcing the Gaoshan people to contribute funds as "shares." These supply and marketing cooperatives are intermediate exploitative agencies for the export of Gaoshan products, and all exported products are purchased at low prices and high "handling fees" are extracted. For example, in Hsiulin Township, Hualien County, where the Gaoshan people live, the supply and marketing cooperative recently purchased bananas at a price of 0.25 New Taiwan Dollars per kilogram, which is only 20% of the market price of bananas in Hualien County.
    Driven by the pressures of life and the threats and enticements of human traffickers, many Gaoshan women are forced to go down the mountains and become prostitutes. Along with hunger comes the prevalence of lung diseases, malaria, and skin diseases in the Gaoshan areas. According to statistics published by the pseudo-health center of Hsiulin Township, Hualien County, in February of this year, there are 8,234 Gaoshan people in Hsiulin Township, and 60% of them suffer from lung disease. The reasons for the disease are "poor housing, poor nutrition, and overwork." The pseudo-health center is "powerless" to deal with this serious infectious disease because the Chiang bandit gang refuses to issue medicines and equipment.

### 台湾高山族人民在蒋贼压迫下生活悲惨

    台湾高山族人民在蒋贼压迫下生活悲惨
    【新华社四日讯】台湾高山族同胞在蒋介石卖国集团的残暴压迫下生活非常悲惨。蒋匪帮在所谓“山地平地化”的口号下实行民族压迫的政策，强迫高山族人民改变他们原来的语言、风俗习惯和宗教信仰。据蒋匪报纸透露，美国和蒋匪“传教士”深入高山族地区活动，强迫高山族人民放弃他们自己的宗教信仰。蒋匪帮还强迫高山族人民改说汉语，不说汉话的就要加倍受到歧视。不少高山族妇女还被迫改穿汉服。
    高山族人民遭到残酷的掠夺和压榨。蒋匪帮封锁高山族地区广大的森林，垄断采伐，以便把木材外运，谋取暴利。高山族人民到森林中去捡拾或截取柴枝，就要被加上滥伐森林的罪名拉去罚款或坐牢。因此，居住在森林区的高山族人民，现在却缺乏柴薪。蒋匪帮还在高山族各村落设立所谓“山地物资供销会”，强迫高山族人民出资作为“股金”。这种供销会是高山族产品外销的中间剥削机构，凡是外销的物产都由供销会压价收购和抽取高额的“手续费”。例如在高山族居住的花莲县秀林乡，供销会最近以每公斤二角五分伪台币的价格收购香蕉，只及花莲县香蕉市价的百分之二十。
    由于生活所迫和人口贩子的威胁诱骗，不少高山族妇女被迫下山，沦为娼妓。随着饥饿而来的是高山族地区的肺病、疟疾和皮肤病等流行。据花莲县秀林乡伪卫生所今年二月发表的统计数字，秀林乡共有高山族人民八千二百三十四人，患肺病者达百分之六十，患病原因是“居所不良，营养太差，操劳过度”。伪卫生所因蒋匪帮不肯发给医药及器械，对这种严重的传染病“束手无策”。
