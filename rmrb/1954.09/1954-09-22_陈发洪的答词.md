Comrades, representatives:
The people of the motherland hold such a grand meeting to welcome us, especially the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Chinese people's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea have sent delegations from the capital of the motherland to welcome us from afar, which makes us feel infinitely honored and extremely grateful. Please allow me to represent all the members of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army returning home to express our heartfelt thanks to all the representatives and comrades, and to pay our lofty respects to the great people of our long-separated motherland.
Four years ago, American imperialism ignited the flames of war in Korea to the edge of the Yalu River, seriously threatening our country's security and world peace. At that time, we responded to the call of the motherland and formed the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to go to Korea to resist the American aggressors together with the heroic Korean People's Army and the Korean people. After two years and nine months of arduous struggle, we finally won the victory of the Korean armistice, drove the American aggressors back to where they originally launched the war, defended the independence of our friendly neighbor Korea, and defended the security of our motherland and world peace. The victory of this great struggle should first of all be attributed to the heroic struggle of the Korean people and the Korean People's Army, and to the full support and enthusiastic encouragement of the people of the motherland to the Volunteer Army.
Since we went abroad to fight, the people of the motherland have taken meticulous care of us. The people of the motherland sent their outstanding children to the front lines in Korea, donated a large number of airplanes and cannons to support us, and continuously supplied us with grain and materials, and called us "the most beloved people." Although we have been separated from the people of the motherland for nearly four years, our hearts are always yearning for the motherland. Every great achievement of the motherland in political, economic, cultural and national defense construction that reached the Korean front lines brought us great joy and inspired our will to fight for the defense of the motherland. In those years of arduous fighting, we were filled with courage whenever we thought of the motherland. The support and encouragement of the people of the motherland gave us the powerful strength to defeat the enemy and defend peace.
In Korea, we have always followed Chairman Mao and the instructions of the people of the motherland, cherished every mountain, every river, every tree and every blade of grass of the Korean people, and united closely with the Korean people. The Korean people also cared for us as if they were caring for their own children. We will never forget the hundreds and thousands of Korean people like Martyr Park Jae-geun who shed blood and sacrificed themselves to support our Volunteer Army; we will never forget the millions of Korean mothers whose hearts warmed us every moment.
The Chinese and Korean people have forged an unbreakable and lofty friendship with blood, and this friendship will always keep us closely united. As we are about to return to our motherland to bid farewell to the Korean people, in the heroic city of Pyongyang and other parts of Korea, the leaders of the Korean Workers' Party, the Korean government, and the People's Army, as well as the Korean people, have given us great honor and encouragement, and expressed their lofty respect to our motherland. We are deeply moved by this great friendship.
In the year or more since the Korean armistice, we have repeatedly exposed and shattered the provocations of the American aggressors and the Syngman Rhee gang who conspired to undermine the Korean armistice. Our Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army have always unswervingly adhered to and defended the Armistice Agreement. Our withdrawal of seven divisions from Korea this time to return to our motherland once again demonstrates our sincerity and confidence in a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. Our comrades who remain in Korea are still vigilantly guarding the positions north of the military demarcation line and along the east and west coasts of northern Korea, shoulder to shoulder with the Korean People's Army, to prevent any enemy provocations and sabotage. Since the Chinese and Korean people have the power to win the Korean armistice, they also have the confidence to strive for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue.
Since the Korean armistice, the Korean people have been vigorously restoring construction and healing the wounds of war. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army has also been helping the Korean people rebuild their homes in various ways. Now, smoke has risen from the villages destroyed by the invaders; in the rubble of the towns, high-rise buildings and houses have been erected. We wholeheartedly congratulate the Korean people on their continuous achievements in the cause of building their own motherland.
After we set foot on the land of our motherland, what makes us particularly excited is the victory of the motherland's construction in the past few years, the thriving atmosphere, and the efforts and brilliant achievements made by the people of the motherland in building a great socialist society. Now the people of the motherland are strengthening their work in all aspects and fighting for the liberation of Taiwan, the sacred territory of the motherland. After we return to our motherland, we will certainly continue to maintain and carry forward the honor given to us by the people of the motherland, follow Chairman Mao's instructions to "be honest and diligent, help each other, and avoid any exaggeration and pride," study hard, and work actively. We are always ready to respond to the call of the motherland and contribute everything to defend the motherland!
Now, the First Session of the First National People's Congress, which has great historical significance, has been successfully opened, and the Constitution of the People's Republic of China will be adopted and promulgated at this meeting. We will certainly earnestly abide by the Constitution and various laws of the country and strive to defend the great socialist construction cause of the motherland!
Long live peace and victory!
Long live our great motherland!
Long live our great leader Chairman Mao!

专栏：

    陈发洪的答词各位代表、各位同志：
    祖国人民举行这样的盛会欢迎我们，特别是中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会、中国人民抗美援朝总会派遣代表团，从祖国的首都远道前来欢迎我们，使我们觉得无限光荣和万分感激。请允许我代表中国人民志愿军归国部队全体人员，向各位代表和全体同志们致以深切的谢意，向我们久别的伟大的祖国人民致以崇高的敬意。
    在四年以前，美帝国主义把在朝鲜点燃的战火燃烧到了鸭绿江边，使我国的安全和世界和平受到严重的威胁。那时，我们响应祖国的召唤，组成中国人民志愿军开赴朝鲜，同英雄的朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民共同反抗美国侵略者。经过了两年零九个月的艰苦斗争，终于取得了朝鲜停战的胜利，将美国侵略者赶回了他们原来发动战争的地方，保卫了我们友邦朝鲜的独立，保卫了我们祖国的安全和世界的和平。获得这一伟大斗争的胜利，首先应归功于英雄的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军的英勇奋斗，应归功于祖国人民对志愿军的全力支援和热情的鼓励。
    我们出国作战以来，祖国人民对于我们的关怀是无微不至的。祖国人民把自己的优秀子弟送到朝鲜前线，祖国人民捐献大量的飞机、大炮支援我们，并且源源不绝地为我们供应粮食和物资，还称呼我们为“最可爱的人”。我们虽然同祖国人民离别将近四年之久，但是我们的心时刻都在向往着祖国。祖国在政治、经济、文化和国防建设上的每一个伟大成就的喜讯传到朝鲜前线的时候，都给我们带来了极大的欢欣，激励着我们为保卫祖国而斗争的意志。在那些艰苦战斗的岁月里，我们一想到祖国，就勇气倍增。祖国人民对我们的支援和鼓励，使我们获得了战胜敌人、保卫和平的强大力量。
    我们在朝鲜，始终遵照毛主席和祖国人民对我们的昭示，爱护朝鲜人民的一山一水、一草一木，同朝鲜人民亲密团结。朝鲜人民也像关怀他们自己子弟一样关怀着我们。我们永远不能忘记那些像朴在根烈士一样的千百个为支援我们志愿军而流血牺牲的朝鲜人民；我们也不能忘记那千千万万的朝鲜母亲，她们的心每时每刻都在温暖着我们。
    中朝人民以鲜血结成了牢不可破的崇高友谊，这种友谊永远使我们紧紧地团结在一起。当我们将要返回祖国向朝鲜人民告别之际，在英雄的平壤市和朝鲜各地，朝鲜劳动党、朝鲜政府和人民军的首长以及朝鲜人民都给予我们极大的荣誉和鼓舞，并对我们的祖国表示了崇高的敬意，我们深深为这种伟大的友谊所感动。
    朝鲜停战以后一年多来，我们已多次戳穿和粉碎了美国侵略者和李承晚匪帮阴谋破坏朝鲜停战的挑衅。我们中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军始终坚持不渝地遵守和保卫着停战协定。我们这次从朝鲜撤出七个师返回祖国，又一次说明了我们对和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意和信心。我们留在朝鲜的同志们，现在仍然同朝鲜人民军并肩警惕地守卫在军事分界线北缘以北和朝鲜北部东西两海岸的阵地上，防止敌人任何的挑衅和破坏行动。中朝人民既然有力量取得了朝鲜停战的胜利，也就有信心争取和平解决朝鲜问题。
    朝鲜停战以来，朝鲜人民正在大力恢复建设，医治战争创伤。中国人民志愿军也从各方面帮助朝鲜人民重建家园。现在，被侵略者毁灭过的村庄，已经升起了炊烟；在城镇的瓦砾堆中，也已树立起一座座高楼和房舍。我们衷心地祝贺朝鲜人民在建设自己祖国的事业中，不断地获得光辉的成就。
    我们踏上祖国的大地以后，使我们特别感到兴奋的，就是几年来祖国建设的胜利，欣欣向荣的气象，祖国人民为建设伟大的社会主义社会所作的努力和所得到的光辉成就。现在祖国人民正从各方面加强工作，为解放祖国的神圣领土台湾而斗争。我们回到祖国之后，一定继续保持和发扬祖国人民所给予我们的荣誉，遵照毛主席“老老实实，勤勤恳恳，互勉互助，力戒任何的虚夸和骄傲”的指示，努力学习，积极工作。我们随时准备响应祖国的号召，为保卫祖国而贡献自己的一切！
    现在具有伟大历史意义的第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议已经胜利开幕，并且就要在这次会议上通过和公布中华人民共和国宪法。我们一定切实地遵守国家的宪法和各种法律，为保卫祖国伟大的社会主义建设事业而奋斗！
    和平胜利万岁！
    我们伟大的祖国万岁！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
