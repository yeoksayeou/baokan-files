Lanxin Railway Route Survey Team
Preliminary Survey Reaches Yumen Oilfield

    The staff of the First Survey and Design Team of the Northwest Design Bureau of the Ministry of Railways completed the preliminary route survey to the Yumen Oilfield on August 6th.

    The survey of the Lanxin Railway began in 1952. This advance force in the construction of the Lanxin Railway was often battered by wind and snow during the survey. When advancing into the Gobi Desert, sometimes trucks could not deliver food, and the staff ate only braised dishes for seven consecutive days, and sometimes they could not drink a single drop of water for a whole day. Under such difficult conditions, work continued as usual. In order to choose the most economical railway line to the Yumen Oilfield, they entered the great grasslands three times and the Gobi Desert four times. Each section of the line had to be measured with two or three comparison lines, and sometimes the lines had to be repeatedly measured and changed to achieve the most reasonable requirements. The staff of the Route Selection Third Detachment, fighting at the forefront, arrived at Jiayuguan, the end of the Great Wall, on August 1st, and met with the Jiuquan Basin Geological Survey Brigade. They arrived at the Yumen Oilfield on August 6th. Now the staff of the Route Selection Third Detachment are measuring comparison lines near the oilfield.

    兰新铁路选线测量队
    初测到玉门油矿
    铁道部西北设计分局第一勘测设计总队的职工们，已于八月六日选线初测到了玉门油矿。
    兰新铁路从一九五二年开始测量，这一支建设兰新铁路的前哨兵，在测量中经常受到风、雪的侵袭，在进军戈壁滩时，有时汽车运不到粮食，职工们连续吃过七天卤菜，有时一天喝不到一口水。在这样艰苦的情况下，工作照常进行。他们为了挑选一条最经济的通向玉门油矿的铁路线，曾三进大草原，四进戈壁滩。每段线路要测量两三条比较线，还有时反复测量改线，要达到最合理的要求。战斗在最前哨的选线第三分队的职工们，八月一日到了长城的尽头——嘉峪关，与酒泉盆地地质测量大队会合，八月六日到了玉门油矿。现在选线三分队的职工们，正在油矿附近测量比较线。
