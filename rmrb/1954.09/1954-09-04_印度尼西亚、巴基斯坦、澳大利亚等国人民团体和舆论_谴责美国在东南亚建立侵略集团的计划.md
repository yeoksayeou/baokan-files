Xinhua News Agency, September 3rd: TASS Jakarta, September 1st: Jakarta newspapers published statements from various organizations condemning the US plan to establish an aggressive bloc in Southeast Asia.

    The Indonesian General Confederation of Labor issued a statement saying that the US ruling clique is trying to ignite the flames of war in Asia. The Indonesian General Confederation of Labor called on all working people in Indonesia to unite and resolutely fight against this aggressive plan, and to strengthen the friendship between the working people of Asia to strive for peace and the security of all countries. The Indonesian General Confederation of Labor demanded that the Indonesian government actively implement a policy of opposing aggression plans and strengthening peace.

    Professor Purbodiningrat, Chairman of the Indonesian National Peace Committee, issued a statement saying that the United States has repeatedly engaged in provocations to create tension in Asia. The statement emphasized that the United States is establishing the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to prepare for war. However, the people of Asia reject this bloc.

    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 2nd: Karachi Dispatch: "Today's News" published an editorial on August 30th entitled "Be Careful," opposing Pakistan's participation in the US-planned Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. The editorial demanded that the Pakistani government be cautious in every step it takes, and take into account the interests of Pakistan and Asia, and should not ignore the demands for world peace.

    The editorial pointed out that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization will be established under the auspices of Western countries, which are all imperialist and colonial countries, and they will require Asian countries to supply them with military bases and cannon fodder to pull chestnuts out of the fire for them in new wars of aggression. The editorial said: "No patriot would accept such conditions."

    The editorial said: "The United States has declared that it will continue to support the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee cliques, and the latter have never concealed their attempts to attack China and North Korea. Participating in the Southeast Asia Defense Group under the auspices of the United States means having the obligation to bear the consequences of the Chiang and Rhee cliques' adventurous behavior."

    The editorial pointed out that the US-planned Southeast Asia aggression bloc will re-tension the Asian and international situation which has been eased as a result of the Geneva Conference. The editorial believes that Pakistan's participation in the Southeast Asia military bloc will also lower its international status and prestige. The editorial called on the Pakistani government to adopt a realistic, prudent and sober diplomatic policy.

    Xinhua News Agency, September 2nd: According to the Australian "Guardian," the Australian National Peace Council issued a statement to the press on August 25th, firmly opposing the Menzies government's undertaking of the obligation to provide Australian troops to the proposed Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

    The statement said that the remarks made by Australian Prime Minister Menzies on August 24th may bring tragic consequences to Australia (Menzies said that Australia is prepared to undertake definite military obligations to the Southeast Asia bloc).

    The Australian National Peace Council pointed out that the obligations undertaken by Australia, especially the obligations to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, will arouse the hostility of millions upon millions of people in our neighboring countries, who believe that this organization—in the words of Indian Prime Minister Nehru—"aims to suppress the aspirations of the Asian people by force."

    Xinhua News Agency, September 2nd: Melbourne Dispatch: The Australian "Guardian" published an article on August 26th saying that the Five Principles mentioned in the joint statements of the Prime Ministers of China and India and the joint statements of the Prime Ministers of China and Burma are welcomed by Southeast Asian countries. The article said that Southeast Asian countries widely cited the Five Principles when expressing their opposition to the planned Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. The article believes that the Five Principles should also "guide the relationship between Australia and its Asian neighbors, and make the Five Principles known to the general public." The article said that adopting the Five Principles means rejecting the US government's crazy plan for a war of aggression.

    印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦、澳大利亚等国人民团体和舆论
    谴责美国在东南亚建立侵略集团的计划
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社雅加达一日讯：雅加达各报刊载了各团体谴责美国在东南亚建立侵略集团的计划的声明。
    印度尼西亚总工会发表声明说，美国统治集团正试图燃起亚洲的战火。印度尼西亚总工会号召印度尼西亚所有劳动人民团结一致，对这个侵略计划进行坚决斗争，并加强亚洲劳动人民之间的友谊，来争取和平和各国的安全。印度尼西亚总工会要求印度尼西亚政府积极地执行反对侵略计划和加强和平的政策。
    印度尼西亚全国和平委员会主席普波迪宁格拉特教授发表声明说，美国一次又一次地进行挑衅以制造亚洲紧张局势。声明着重指出，美国建立东南亚公约组织是为了准备战争。但是，亚洲人民唾弃这个集团。
    【新华社新德里二日电】喀喇蚩消息：“今天报”八月三十日发表题为“小心些”的社论，反对巴基斯坦参加美国策划中的东南亚公约组织。社论要求巴基斯坦政府对它所采取的每一步骤都要小心谨慎，而且要考虑到巴基斯坦和亚洲的利益，不应忽视对于世界和平的要求。
    社论指出，东南亚公约组织将在西方国家主持下成立，而这些国家都是帝国主义国家和殖民国家，它们将要求亚洲国家供给它们军事基地和炮灰，为它们在新的侵略战争中火中取栗。社论说：“任何爱国者都不会接受这样的条件”。
    社论说：“美国曾宣称要继续支持蒋介石和李承晚集团，而后者从来没有掩饰过他们进攻中国和北朝鲜的企图。参加美国主持下的东南亚防务集团就是意味着有义务要承担蒋、李集团冒险行为的后果。”
    社论指出，美国策划的东南亚侵略集团将使由于日内瓦会议的结果而得到了缓和的亚洲和国际局势重行紧张。社论认为，巴基斯坦参加东南亚军事集团也将降低它的国际地位和声望。社论要求巴基斯坦政府采取现实的、谨慎的、清醒的外交政策。
    【新华社二日讯】据澳大利亚“卫报”报道，澳大利亚全国和平理事会在八月二十五日对报界发表声明，坚决反对孟席斯政府承担对拟议中的东南亚公约组织提供澳大利亚军队的义务。
    声明说，澳大利亚总理孟席斯八月二十四日发表的谈话可能给澳大利亚带来悲惨的后果（孟席斯说，澳大利亚准备承担东南亚集团的肯定的军事义务）。
    澳大利亚全国和平理事会指出，澳大利亚承担的义务，特别是对东南亚公约组织承担的义务，将引起我们各邻邦千千万万人民的敌视，他们认为这个组织——用印度总理尼赫鲁的话说——“旨在以武力压制亚洲人民的愿望。”
    【新华社二日讯】墨尔本消息：澳大利亚“卫报”八月二十六日刊载一篇文章说，中印两国总理联合声明和中缅两国总理联合声明中提到的五项原则受到东南亚国家的欢迎。文章说，东南亚国家在表示反对策划中的东南亚公约组织时，广泛引用了五项原则。文章认为，五项原则也应该“指导澳大利亚和它的亚洲邻国的关系，并使五项原则为广大群众知道”。文章说，采取五项原则就意味着拒绝美国政府的疯狂的侵略战争计划。
