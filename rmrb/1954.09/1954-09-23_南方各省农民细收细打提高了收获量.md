Farmers in southern provinces across China have essentially completed the harvest of mid-season rice. The method of careful harvesting and threshing was widely promoted during the harvest, and significant achievements were made. In Sichuan Province, during the harvest season, large numbers of cadres were dispatched to rural areas to guide farmers in improving harvesting techniques and reducing waste. The province's over 51 million mu of harvested rice fields saw an average reduction in loss of 5 jin per mu. In the suburbs of Luzhou, farmers promoted advanced threshing techniques such as "light first, then heavy," and as a result, ten townships increased their grain yield by more than 100,000 jin due to reduced waste. Preliminary estimates from the four special districts of Nanchong, Suining, Fuling, and Daxian indicate that they can increase production by over 160 million jin. In Anhui Province, the method of "threshing once and delivering straw twice" was widely implemented, avoiding losses from incomplete threshing. In Xuancheng County, the Ma Dehuan mutual aid team in Youzha Township harvested 282 jin per mu after the first threshing of their 40 mu of land; after a second threshing, they harvested an additional 16 jin per mu. Farmer Ma Jiashu's two mu of land, after "threshing and delivering straw twice," saw an increase of 22 jin per mu. If the township's more than 1,000 mu of land could be threshed one more time, it could increase production by 16,800 jin of grain. In Hengshan County, Hunan Province, more than 87,000 mu of land increased their rice yield by more than 87,000 jin due to improved harvesting techniques, reducing waste by about 10 jin per mu. In many areas of Guizhou Province, threshing methods using threshing floors surrounded by mats, or raising the mats and adding higher canopies, were promoted, increasing the harvest yield. Kade Township in Dejiang County harvested 65,800 jin more than in the past. Xikang and Hubei provinces also emphasized careful harvesting and threshing this year to reduce waste.

    南方各省农民细收细打提高了收获量
    我国南方各省中熟稻已基本收割完毕。在收割中普遍推广了细收细打的方法，并取得很大成绩。四川省在收割期间，各地抽调大批干部下乡领导农民改进收割技术，减少了抛撒。全省已收割的五千一百多万亩水稻，平均每亩减少损失五斤。泸州市郊区农民推广了“先轻后重”等先进打稻技术后，十个乡因减少抛撒而增加的粮食便达十万多斤；南充、遂宁、涪陵、达县四个专区，据初步估计，可增产一亿六千万多斤。安徽省各地普遍实行了“打一次二交草”的办法，避免了打场脱粒不净的损失。宣城县油榨乡马德焕互助组四十亩田，打第一次后，每亩收二百八十二斤；重打一次后，每亩又多收了十六斤。农民马家树的二亩田“打二交草”后，每亩增收了二十二斤。全乡一千多亩田，如能多打一次，就可增产一万六千八百多斤谷。湖南省衡山县八万七千多亩田，因改进了收割技术，就多收了八万七千多斤稻谷，每亩减少浪费约十斤。贵州省不少地区推广了挞斗围席或将围席加高和加高顶篷的打谷方法，提高了收获量，德江县凯德乡比过去多收六万五千八百多斤。西康、湖北等省今年也都做到精收细打，减少浪费。
