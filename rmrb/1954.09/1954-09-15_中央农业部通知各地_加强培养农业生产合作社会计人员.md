Notice from the Central Ministry of Agriculture to All Regions
Strengthen the Training of Accounting Personnel for Agricultural Producer Cooperatives

The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government recently issued a notice requiring all regions to continue strengthening the cultivation and training of accounting personnel for agricultural producer cooperatives and to increase the number of accounting instructors.

The notice stated: Helping agricultural producer cooperatives cultivate and train accounting personnel and doing a good job in financial accounting is an important link in consolidating and developing agricultural producer cooperatives. Therefore, all regions should conduct a short-term training for the existing accountants of agricultural producer cooperatives before the autumn harvest, taking the county (or prefecture) as the unit. The training content should focus on the specific practices of autumn harvest distribution and year-end closing of accounts. At the same time, a group of accounting personnel for newly established cooperatives should also be trained. Because the number of newly established cooperatives planned for in various regions is very large, attention must be paid to starting early and training in batches, so as to establish accounts at the same time as the establishment of the cooperatives, to avoid the chaotic phenomenon of accounting books caused by some places establishing cooperatives for a long time without establishing account books and making up accounts afterward. The training quantity should be determined according to the possible number of cooperative development. In principle, each newly established cooperative should train one person. Accounting students should be selected and recommended by agricultural producer cooperatives from among peasant semi-intellectuals, shopkeepers, and junior and senior primary school graduates, and attention should be paid to those who have no political problems and have prospects for business training. In order to improve the effect of the training, all regions should, in accordance with the spirit of seeking truth from facts, conduct training in the improvement of old-style accounts and simplified new-style accounts according to the cultural level and business ability of each accountant.

The notice stated: In order to continuously improve the professional level of accounting personnel in agricultural producer cooperatives, all regions should actively add accounting instructors to the county agricultural and forestry departments and agricultural technology promotion stations to carry out regular financial accounting research and guidance work. In counties with a large number of agricultural producer cooperatives and with the necessary conditions, two or three accounting instructors should be set up in the county agricultural and forestry departments (bureaus). Where there are many agricultural producer cooperatives in a district and agricultural technology promotion stations have been established, a full-time accounting instructor should be set up in the technology promotion station according to actual needs and conditions. In addition, all regions may invite accountants from supply and marketing cooperatives, the People's Bank, and other departments to do some counseling work for the accountants of several agricultural producer cooperatives nearby. At the same time, short-term accounting training classes should also be attached to various secondary agricultural schools to meet the needs of the large-scale development of agricultural producer cooperatives.

    中央农业部通知各地
    加强培养农业生产合作社会计人员
    中央人民政府农业部最近发出通知，要求各地继续加强培养和训练农业生产合作社会计人员，并增设会计辅导员。
    通知说：帮助农业生产合作社培养和训练会计人员，做好财务会计工作，是巩固和发展农业生产合作社的重要一环。因此，各地应在秋收前，以县（或专区）为单位，对现有农业生产合作社的会计员进行一次短期训练。训练内容要着重秋收分配和年终结账的具体做法。同时还要训练一批新建社的会计人员，因为各地计划新建社的数量很大，必须注意及早动手，分批训练，尽量做到从建社起，即同时建账，避免过去有些地方建社很长时间，还没有建立账簿，事后补账，以致造成会计账簿的混乱现象。训练数量应依据建社发展的可能数量确定，原则上应做到每个新建社都训练一个。会计学员主要由农业生产合作社从农民半知识分子、商店记账员及初中、高小毕业生当中挑选保送，并要注意政治上无问题和业务上有培养前途。为了提高训练的效果，各地应根据实事求是的精神，按照每个会计员的文化水平和业务能力，分别进行改良旧式账和简明新式账的训练。
    通知说：为了不断地提高农业生产合作社会计人员的业务水平，各地应积极在县农林科和农业技术推广站增设会计辅导员，以进行经常的财务会计研究工作与指导工作，在农业生产合作社数量较多并有条件的县份，应在县农林科（局）设两三名会计辅导员，凡农业生产合作社较多的区，并已有了农业技术推广站的，应按实际需要和条件，在技术推广站内设一名专职会计辅导员。此外各地可约请供销合作社、人民银行等部门的会计为其附近若干农业生产合作社的会计兼做些辅导工作。同时在各中等农业学校也应附设会计短期训练班，以适应农业生产合作社大量发展的需要。
