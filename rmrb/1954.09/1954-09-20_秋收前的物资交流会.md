    Material Exchange Fair Before Autumn Harvest

    Before the autumn harvest, Zhangbei County, Hebei Province, made use of the local temple fair to hold an urban-rural material exchange conference. Farmers from the surrounding villages enthusiastically participated in this exchange fair. Cooperatives and farmers from other counties also rushed to purchase livestock. At the fair, supply and marketing cooperatives supplied farmers with a large number of agricultural tools for autumn harvesting and autumn cultivation, as well as daily necessities such as general merchandise and fabrics. Among them, agricultural tools were worth more than 80 million yuan. During the conference, supply and marketing cooperatives also purchased a large number of fattened pigs and eggs. The total transaction volume of the conference reached more than 4.3 billion yuan, of which livestock accounted for more than half. (Zhang Bingqian)

    秋收前的物资交流会
    秋收以前，河北省张北县利用当地的庙会，举办了城乡物资交流大会。四乡农民踊跃地参加了这个交流会。外县的合作社和农民也赶来购买牲畜。会上，供销合作社等供应给农民大批秋收、秋耕的农具和百货、布疋等日用品。其中农具值八千多万元。大会期间，供销合作社还收购了大量肥猪和蛋品。大会总交易额达四十三亿余元，其中牲畜占半数以上。　　　　　　（张秉谦）
