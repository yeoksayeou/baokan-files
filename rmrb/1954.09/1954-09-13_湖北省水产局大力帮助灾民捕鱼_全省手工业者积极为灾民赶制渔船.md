The Hubei Provincial Aquatic Products Bureau is vigorously helping and organizing disaster victims to engage in fishing production.

Due to rising river waters in Hubei Province this year and the expansion of water surfaces, it is estimated that after the floodwaters recede, freshwater fish production will reach approximately 500 million jin. This is an important sideline for disaster victims to engage in production for self-salvation. As early as June, after some areas suffered from flooding, the Hubei Provincial People's Government allocated aquatic product funds of 5 billion yuan and aquatic product loans of 5 billion yuan, distributed to various counties to organize disaster victims to engage in fishing production. Currently, disaster victims and fishermen in some areas have been organized to go fishing in the lakes, while disaster victims and fishermen in most areas are actively purchasing and repairing fishing boats and fishing gear, preparing to go into the lakes.

This year, Hubei Province has a large fish yield, and there are many people fishing. The originally prepared supply of fishery supplies to fishermen is insufficient. Now, the Hubei Provincial Aquatic Products Company has sent people to Sichuan and Henan to purchase Sichuan bamboo strips, palm ropes, and other fishery supplies. The company has also newly established a freshwater product promotion department, responsible for assisting various counties in purchasing and promoting aquatic products to other regions.

Hubei Province currently has eight fishery production cooperatives and 334 fishery mutual aid groups. In the production and disaster relief movement, various localities will further develop fishery mutual aid and cooperation organizations to help some disaster victims solve the difficulties of not knowing how to fish and lacking tools. The Hubei Provincial Aquatic Products Bureau dispatched four working groups to counties along the river and lake areas in early August to organize disaster victims and fishermen to fish in an organized manner. In order to help disaster victims who have just joined fishing production learn fishing techniques, the Hubei Provincial Aquatic Products Bureau recently convened a technical symposium for experienced elderly fishermen and is now preparing to combine scientific fishing methods with the existing experience of the masses to widely disseminate them to various regions.

At the same time, the Hubei Provincial Aquatic Products Bureau has coordinated with relevant departments such as supply and marketing cooperatives and food companies to formulate detailed plans for the purchase, sales, processing, and transportation of fishery products; all parties are preparing to cooperate closely to welcome the peak season for fish production.

Handicraft workers in various parts of Hubei Province are actively rushing to produce 60,000 fishing boats to support disaster victims in production for self-salvation.

In general, shipbuilding work is based on the backbone of woodworking and ironworking production cooperatives, organizing handicraft production groups and individual handicraft workers to concentrate in several locations for production. Echeng County has already used this method to organize more than 1,100 carpenters and more than 140 ironworkers to invest in shipbuilding production. The county's shipbuilding work officially started in late August, preparing to build 10,000 fishing boats within three months, and also preparing to repair 12,000 old fishing boats. Jianli County has organized 280 carpenters and 60 iron furnaces, planning to produce 700 fishing boats per month, and more than 2,000 can be built this winter. Handicraft workers in Xinzhou, Daye, and Echeng counties had already accepted orders for 1,130 fishing boats in mid-August and are now delivering goods one after another.

The shipbuilding handicraft workers have a high level of production enthusiasm, and they are now actively using their brains and finding shortcuts to ensure the completion of the production task of 60,000 fishing boats before December. The Chengguan Woodware Production Cooperative in Echeng County tried to rationally divide labor and frequently exchange technology, and the daily output has increased from the original 15 to 30; 36 ironworking handicraft workers actively tapped potential, and the monthly production of boat nails increased from 4,000 jin to 6,000 jin.

The local Party committees and People's Governments pay great attention to leading the work of producing fishing boats. The Huanggang District Commissioner's Office and other units have established joint shipbuilding offices and other institutions. Echeng County has transferred more than ten cadres, including members of the District Committee and Town Committee, to go deep into the shipbuilding construction sites to specifically lead the shipbuilding work. Timber companies, aquatic product departments, and supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels also closely cooperate to ensure the timely supply of raw materials, the purchase of finished products, and the resolution of difficulties in funding and other aspects.

    湖北省水产局大力帮助灾民捕鱼
    全省手工业者积极为灾民赶制渔船
    湖北省水产局积极帮助和组织灾民进行捕鱼生产。
    湖北省今年因江水上涨，水面扩大，预计水退以后，可产淡水鱼五亿斤左右。这是灾民们进行生产自救的一项重要副业。早在六月份部分地区遭受水灾以后，湖北省人民政府便拨出水产资金五十亿元、水产贷款五十亿元，分发各县，组织灾民进行捕鱼生产。目前，部分地区的灾民和渔民已经组织起来下湖捕鱼，大部地区的灾民、渔民正积极购置和修补渔船、渔具，准备下湖。
    今年湖北省鱼的产量大，捕鱼的人也多，原来准备供应给渔民的渔业用品已感不足。现在湖北省水产公司已经派人分别到四川、河南采购川篾、棕绳等渔业用品。该公司还新成立了淡水产品推销部，负责协助各县收购和向外地推销渔产品。
    湖北省现有渔业生产合作社八个、渔业互助组三百三十四个。在生产救灾运动中，各地将进一步发展渔业互助合作组织，帮助部分灾民解决不会捕鱼和工具不足的困难。湖北省水产局在八月上旬已派出四个工作组到沿江滨湖各县，着手组织灾民、渔民有组织地捕鱼。为了帮助刚参加捕鱼生产的灾民学会捕鱼技术，湖北省水产局最近召集有经验的老年渔民举行了一次技术座谈会，现正准备把科学的捕鱼方法和群众已有的经验结合起来，广泛地向各地传播。
    同时，湖北省水产局已经协同供销合作社、食品公司等有关部门，订出了详细的渔产品收购、销售、加工、运输的计划；各方面准备密切配合，迎接产鱼旺季的到来。　（本报湖北记者站）
    湖北省各地手工业者积极赶制六万只渔船，支援灾民生产自救。
    各地造船工作一般都以木业和铁业生产合作社为骨干，组织手工业生产小组和个体手工业者集中在几个地点进行生产。鄂城县已经用这样的办法组织木工一千一百多人、铁工一百四十多人投入造船生产。八月下旬，该县造船工作正式动工，准备在三个月内造成一万只渔船，另外还准备修理一万二千只旧渔船。监利县已组织木工二百八十人，铁业红炉六十部，计划每月生产七百只渔船，今冬可造成二千多只。新洲、大冶、鄂城三县的手工业者在八月中旬已经接受了一千一百三十只渔船的订货任务，目前正陆续交货。
    造船手工业工人生产情绪都很高，现正积极动脑筋、找窍门，保证在十二月以前完成六万只渔船的生产任务。鄂城县城关木器生产合作社设法合理分工，经常交流技术，每日产量已经由原来的十五只增加到三十只；铁业三十六个手工业者积极挖掘潜力，每月生产船钉的数量，由四千斤增加到六千斤。
    各地中共党委、人民政府都很注意领导生产渔船的工作。黄冈区专员公署等成立了造船联合办公室等机构，鄂城县抽调区委、镇委委员等十多名干部，深入造船工地，具体领导造船工作。木材公司、水产部门和各级供销合作社也都紧密配合，保证及时供应原料，收购成品，解决资金等方面的困难。　（滕春风）
