    Credit cooperatives in disaster-stricken areas of Hubei Province have actively supported the masses in production and disaster relief, and have already achieved considerable success. The Datang Township Credit Cooperative in Macheng County has issued loans of 12.32 million yuan to help 134 farmers replant crops and 22 farmers apply topdressing fertilizer to cotton fields. At the same time, it has also helped some farmers repair their houses and solved the problem of food shortages. The Guandu Township Credit Cooperative in Yingcheng County has issued loans of 12.7 million yuan, promoting the development of sideline production throughout the township. In fishing alone, the township can earn 30 million yuan per day. Hu Minggui, a farmer in the Sixth Group of Haohu Township in Xianning County, once borrowed 100,000 yuan from a private lender at a monthly interest rate as high as 25 percent. After learning about this situation, the township credit cooperative immediately provided him with a loan, helping him to get rid of this debt relationship and avoid exploitation by usurers.
    Because they have promptly helped the masses solve their difficulties, the credit cooperatives in disaster areas have greatly increased their prestige and their business has developed. After the Wumei Township Credit Cooperative in Hanyang County issued loans to help 88 farmers solve their difficulties in production and disaster relief, it absorbed 2.83 million yuan in deposits, recovered 3.49 million yuan in loans, and newly absorbed 1.05 million yuan in share capital within a few days.

    湖北省灾区信用合作社支持生产救灾有成绩
    湖北省遭受水灾地区的信用合作社积极支持群众生产救灾，已经有不少成绩。麻城县大塘乡信用合作社发放贷款一千二百三十二万元，帮助一百三十四户农民改种，二十二户在棉田施了追肥，同时还帮助一些农户修理了房屋，解决了缺口粮的困难。应城县官渡乡信用合作社发放贷款一千二百七十万元，推动了全乡的副业生产。仅捕鱼一项，全乡每天可收入三千万元。咸宁县蒿湖乡第六组农民胡明贵曾同私人借钱十万元，月息高达百分之二十五，该乡信用合作社了解这一情况以后，立即贷款给他，帮他解除了这项债务关系，避免了遭受高利贷剥削。
    灾区信用合作社由于及时帮助群众解决困难，威信大为提高，业务得到发展。汉阳县乌梅乡信用合作社发放贷款帮助八十八户农民解决了生产救灾中的困难以后，几天内就吸收存款二百八十三万元，收回贷款三百四十九万元，新吸收股金一百零五万元。（本报湖北记者站）
