Sichuan Province farmers are actively selling surplus early rice to the state. This year, early rice production in most areas of Sichuan Province has increased by about 10% compared to last year. From the time early rice was harvested until August 3rd, state-owned grain companies in the five special districts of Luzhou, Neijiang, Suining, Yibin, and Jiangjin had already purchased more than 24 million jin of early rice. The Naxi County state-owned grain company and supply and marketing cooperative have set up twenty-one purchasing stations throughout the county, making it very convenient for farmers to sell early rice; in the Chengguan District alone, nearly 100,000 jin of early rice are purchased every market day. Many members of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams are taking the lead in selling early rice to the state. More than seventy members of the Xianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Luzhou City have collectively sold eighty lao shi of early rice to the state grain purchasing station.

    四川省农民踊跃卖早稻
    四川省农民纷纷把多余的早稻卖给国家。今年，四川省多数地区的早稻都比去年增产一成左右。从早稻登场到八月三日，泸州、内江、遂宁、宜宾、江津五个专区的国营粮食公司，已经收购早稻二千四百多万斤。纳溪县国营粮食公司和供销合作社在全县设立了二十一个收购站，农民出卖早稻很方便；仅城关区逢场每天就收购早稻近十万斤。许多农业生产合作社和互助组的成员都带头把早稻卖给国家。泸州市郊区先锋农业生产合作社七十多个社员已集体把八十老石早稻卖给国家粮食收购站。
