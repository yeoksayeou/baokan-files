    A People's Court Reception Room Supported by the People
    He Wen
    In July of this year, I visited the People's Reception Room of the Eighth District People's Court in Tianjin. This People's Reception Room is located at the entrance of the court. Upon entering, I saw a row of people sitting on long benches waiting to speak. The room contained four reception desks, and several ordinary people were explaining their intentions and requests to the cadres of the reception room. The cadres listened patiently and recorded their conversations.

    Among these people, the most eye-catching was an old man dressed as a farmer. He told the reception room cadre that he came from Beiying Village, Fourth District, En County, Shandong Province, and his name was Zhou Tiansen. Last year, he and several other farmers in the village jointly purchased 20,000 catties of sesame paste cakes (for fertilizing fields) from Fengtai Firm in Houhutong, Yangjiashuipu, Tianjin. They paid the full amount for the goods at that time, but the merchant only delivered 12,000 catties of sesame paste cakes. After the government announced the unified purchase and sale of grain, Fengtai Firm stopped delivering the goods and did not refund the remaining money. From March to May this year, the farmers of Beiying Village sent people to Tianjin several times to recover the money; but the merchant of Fengtai Firm deceived them by saying, "Go back, I will remit the money to you soon." By July this year, the merchant still hadn't returned the money, so Zhou Tiansen had to go to the court to request a solution. Speaking of this, the old man Zhou was very angry with the merchant's behavior. He said, "Comrade, buying the cakes was to increase production. If they had refunded the money earlier, wouldn't we have been able to buy from the cooperative? Now I've run around four times for this matter, and the work in the fields has been delayed!" After the reception room cadre listened to him, he immediately picked up the phone and notified the merchant of Fengtai Firm to come over immediately.

    The merchant, named Fan Xingqi, was very cunning, but he could not deny the facts stated by the old man; he finally lowered his head. At this time, the cadre criticized him, saying that this kind of behavior is not allowed today, especially delaying farmers' production. Under these circumstances, the merchant could no longer deny it and promised to refund the money in full the next day; at the same time, he also offered to compensate the farmers for the loss of round-trip travel expenses. The next day, before Zhou Tiansen set off to return to Shandong, he happily came to the court's reception room again and said to the reception room cadre, "I've lived for more than sixty years and seen a lot of things. In the old society, which court didn't recognize money but not reason! Only our people's court today can handle affairs so fairly. If it weren't for the court's prompt handling this time, I wouldn't even have money for food and lodging!"

    I thought that perhaps because this old farmer came from out of town, the comrades in the reception room handled it so quickly, and other cases might not be so fast? But later, when Comrade Zhang Chengyu from the reception room introduced the work situation, I learned that the simple cases received by the reception room are generally handled very promptly. In the first half of the year, they handled more than 1,000 simple cases, of which 60% were resolved on the same day, and most of the rest did not exceed seven days. In addition to simple cases, the reception room also wrote many complaints for the masses free of charge, answered many inquiries about litigation and legal matters, and generally resolved them on the spot.

    Comrade Zhang Chengyu said to me: "The main purpose of establishing the People's Reception Room is to facilitate the people. If things are dragged out, how can we facilitate the people?" He also told me that the tasks of the People's Reception Room are not only the above-mentioned ones, but also a very important task, which is to accept the people's accusations, suggestions, and criticisms of the court's work through handling people's letters and receiving visiting masses. The People's Reception Room of the Eighth District People's Court is personally led by the president of the court. The people's letters received every day are personally opened, reviewed, and instructed by the president, and then handed over to the cadres of the reception room for handling. If the president is temporarily busy, the court's secretary will take over. The opinions raised by the visiting masses are also recorded by the reception room and reported to the president, so as to improve the work of the court. He also told me the following incident:

    A worker named Liu Junren, who lived in Luojia Hutong, Yinher 2nd Street, Eighth District, had a dispute with his landlord, Feng Shiquan, over the issue of vacating the house. The landlord sued the court. On the morning of April 1st this year, Comrade Mu Chenggui, who was handling the case, notified Liu Junren by phone to come to the court. At that time, Liu did not want to delay production for personal matters because the factory's production tasks were very busy, and requested to come after get off work at five o'clock. Comrade Mu disagreed. Liu Junren asked his daughter-in-law, Xie Shu'e, to represent him. Comrade Mu was very unhappy, sent her back without asking any questions, and still insisted that Liu Junren himself come, and said: "If he doesn't come again, we will issue a summons." Xie Shu'e was rebuffed, went back and told her husband, Liu Jingyao (also a worker), about what happened. Liu Jingyao wrote a letter to the District People's Court, criticizing Comrade Mu's attitude. After seeing the letter, the leading comrades of the court believed that Liu Jingyao's criticism was correct, and asked Comrade Mu to conduct a good self-criticism, and should pay attention to overcoming this in future work. After Comrade Mu made a self-criticism, Comrade Shi Runliang of the reception room also personally went to Liu Junren's home on behalf of the president of the court to apologize. Liu Junren's family was very satisfied with the court's serious and responsible attitude. They said, "It's just a small matter, and we still troubled the comrades of the court to make a trip. Only our people's court can do this!"

    Yes, such things never happened and would never have happened in the old society. With the founding of the People's Republic of China, a new relationship between the state and the people has emerged, that is: the people and the state are integrated. The People's Court is an important part of the state power. It is everywhere for our people, and the people also love and care for their own court. The People's Reception Room of the Eighth District People's Court of Tianjin that I saw is only one of the many People's Reception Rooms of the People's Courts across the country, and its work is only a part of the people's judicial work; but from the above-mentioned work of the People's Reception Room of this District People's Court, it can be seen that: in our country, the people are the masters of the country, and the people have the responsibility to supervise their own courts; and the courts must also maintain close contact with the masses, listen to the opinions of the people, and continuously improve and improve their work.

### 一个受人民拥护的人民法院接待室

    一个受人民拥护的人民法院接待室
    何文
    我在今年七月间参观过天津市八区人民法院的人民接待室。这个人民接待室设在法院的大门口。一进去就看见长椅上坐着一排等待谈话的群众，房间里放着四张接待桌，几个老百姓正在向接待室的干部诉说他们的来意和要求，干部耐心地听着，低头记录他们的谈话。
    在这些人当中，最引人注目的是一位农民装束的老大爷，他对接待室的干部说，他是从山东恩县四区北营村来的，叫周天森。去年，他和同村几户农民合资向天津市杨家水铺后胡同丰泰栈买了二万斤麻酱饼（肥田用），当时把货款全部交清，可是商人只交了一万二千斤麻酱饼。政府宣布粮食统购统销以后，丰泰栈就不再交货，也没有退回余款。从今年三月到五月的三个月中间，北营村的这几户农民曾经多次派人来津要回这笔钱；但丰泰栈的商人欺骗他们说：“你们回去吧，我很快就把钱给你们汇去。”到了今年七月，商人还是不退钱，周天森只好到法院请求解决。说到这里，周老大爷对商人这种行为很气愤，他说：“同志，买饼是为了增加生产，他们要是早退钱，俺不是可以向合作社买吗？现在为这件事跑了四趟，地里的活都叫耽误啦！”接待室的干部听完了他的话，立刻就拿起电话筒通知丰泰栈的商人立即来一趟。
    这个商人叫范兴琪，很狡猾，但是对老大爷所说的事实，却无法否认；他终于低下了头。这时，干部批评他说：这种行为在今天是不允许的，尤其是耽误农民的生产更不应该。在这种情况下，商人再无法抵赖，保证在第二天一定把钱退清；同时他还提出赔偿农民往返路费的损失。第二天，周老大爷动身回山东以前，又高高兴兴地来到法院的接待室，对接待室的干部说：“俺活了六十多岁，见的事可不少，旧社会哪一个法院不是认钱不认理！只有今天咱人民的法院才能办事这样公道。俺这回来，要不是法院办得麻利，连吃饭住店的钱都没有啦！”
    我想也许因为这位农民老大爷是从外地来的，接待室的同志才办得这样快，其他的案件就不一定这样快吧？但是后来在接待室的张成玉同志介绍工作情况时，我才知道接待室收到的简易案件，一般都办理得很及时，上半年他们处理了一千多件简易案件，其中就有百分之六十是当天解决的，其余的也多没有超过七天。除了简易案件以外，接待室还免费替群众写了很多诉状，解答了不少有关诉讼和法律方面的询问，而且一般都是当场解决的。
    张成玉同志对我说：“设立人民接待室主要就是为了便利人民，如果办事拖拖拉拉，怎么能便利人民呢？”他还告诉我，人民接待室的任务不仅是以上所说的那些，还有一项很重要的工作，那就是通过处理人民来信和接见来访的群众，接受人民的检举、建议和对法院工作的批评。八区人民法院的人民接待室是由院长亲自领导的，每天收到的人民来信，都由院长亲自拆阅、批示，然后交给接待室的干部办理。如果院长临时有事，由法院的秘书代看。对于来访群众所提的意见，也都由接待室负责记录下来，向院长汇报，据以改进法院的工作。他又对我谈了下面这样一件事：
    有一个叫刘俊人的工人，住在八区沿河二大街罗家胡同，因为腾房问题和房东冯世全发生纠纷，房东告到法院。今年四月一日上午，承办这个案件的穆成贵同志用电话通知刘俊人来法院。当时刘因工厂生产任务很忙，不愿为了私事耽误生产，要求在五点钟下班以后来。穆同志不同意。刘俊人就叫他的儿媳谢书娥代表他来了。穆同志很不高兴，没有问话，就打发她回去，而且仍然坚持要刘俊人本人来，并且说：“如果他再不到，我们就下传票了。”谢书娥碰了这个钉子，回去把事情的经过告诉了她的丈夫刘景曜（也是工人）。刘景曜写了一封信给区人民法院，对穆同志的态度提出了批评。法院的领导同志看到信后，认为刘景曜的批评是正确的，要穆同志很好地检查，并且应该在今后的工作中注意克服。穆同志作了检讨以后，接待室的石润良同志还代表法院院长亲自到刘俊人家去道歉。刘俊人一家人对法院这种严肃认真的态度很满意。他们说：“为这点小事，还麻烦法院同志跑一趟，只有咱们人民法院才能这样！”
    是的，像这样的事在旧社会是绝对没有过也决不会有的。随着中华人民共和国的成立，已经出现了国家和人民之间的新的关系，这就是：人民和国家凝成了一体。人民法院是国家政权的重要组成部分之一，它处处为了我们人民，人民也热爱和关怀自己的法院。像我所看到的天津市八区人民法院人民接待室，只不过是全国许多人民法院人民接待室当中的一个，它的工作也只不过是人民司法工作当中的一部分；但是就从这个区人民法院的人民接待室的上述工作已经可以看出：在我们的国家里，人民是国家的主人，人民有责任监督自己的法院；而法院也必须经常保持和群众的密切联系，听取人民群众的意见，不断改进和提高自己的工作。
