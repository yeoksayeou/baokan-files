Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 2nd: The August issue of the Japanese magazine "Kaizo" published a record of a lecture by Professor Seijiro Usami of Hosei University in Japan, entitled "Deflation and Economic Crisis."

	Seijiro Usami said that the Japanese economy had fallen into a crisis of overproduction as early as three years ago. This is because the Japanese government has pursued a policy of economic militarization with inflation as its main means, and the resulting expansion of production, while ignoring the lives of the people; trade with China has been banned, making the road to normal economic development even narrower.

	Seijiro Usami pointed out that the U.S. "special procurement orders" and the Japanese government's financial allocations have guaranteed the expansion of a series of means of production departments aimed at strengthening the war economy system, and promoted the tendency of fiscal inflation, expanding the credit of the Bank of Japan. This is the Japanese type of military inflation policy. This policy has expanded production on the one hand and reduced the purchasing power of the masses on the other. At the same time, in terms of prices, monopoly capital, with the help of inflation, not only prevented the price decline caused by overproduction, but also raised prices. Monopoly capital strengthens export dumping on the one hand, and uses the method of maintaining and raising domestic monopoly prices to make up for this deficit. This deprives the masses of their income and creates mature conditions for the crisis.

	Seijiro Usami said that the Japanese government's fiscal and financial "tightening" policy restricts investment and loans, which does not violate the law of monopoly capital to maintain maximum profits. Monopoly capitalists intend to use this policy to first "eliminate" small and medium-sized enterprises and enterprises in the non-monopoly capital system, create unemployment, reduce wages and rice prices, and transfer all the losses of the crisis to the people. However, during the financial "tightening" period, concentrated lending was still strengthened through the Bank of Japan's supplementary credit loans; in the "tightened" fiscal budget, military expenditures and investments and loans to major monopoly capital groups were guaranteed.

	Seijiro Usami emphasized that this policy is precisely to establish the U.S.-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement" system required by the United States, that is, to rapidly strengthen Japanese militarism and allow the United States' surplus commodities and capital to invade the domestic market, transferring the U.S. economic crisis to Japan. While the "tightening" policy is being implemented, the clutches of U.S. "economic assistance" have stretched out to Japan, and it will gradually become the traction force for strengthening the subordinate war economy system.

	Seijiro Usami finally said that, however, this "tightening" policy, which serves the revival of militarism and makes the people increasingly impoverished, cannot be carried out smoothly, and it will inevitably deepen various contradictions at home and abroad day by day, especially increasingly violating the vital interests of the broad masses of people of all strata.

    论述日本经济军事化政策造成的经济危机
   【新华社二日讯】东京消息：八月份的日本杂志“改造”月刊发表了日本法政大学教授宇佐美诚次郎的一篇讲演的记录，题目是“通货紧缩和经济危机”。
    宇佐美诚次郎说，日本经济早在三年前就陷入了生产过剩的危机。这是因为日本政府推行了以通货膨胀为主要手段的经济军事化政策以及因此造成的生产扩大，同时却不管人民的生活；日中贸易遭到禁止，走向正常的经济发展的道路因而变得更加狭小。
    宇佐美诚次郎指出：美国的“特需订货”和日本政府的财政拨款，保证了以加强战争经济体制为目标的一系列生产手段部门的扩大，促进了财政上的通货膨胀倾向，扩大了日本银行的信用。这就是日本类型的军事通货膨胀政策。这种政策一方面扩大了生产，一方面降低了群众的购买力。同时，在物价方面，垄断资本借助于通货膨胀不仅防止了因生产过剩而出现的价格下跌，反而使价格提高。垄断资本一面加强出口倾销，一面用维持和提高国内垄断价格的办法来弥补这个亏空。这样就剥夺了群众的所得，也给危机造成了成熟的条件。
    宇佐美诚次郎说：日本政府的财政金融“紧缩”政策限制投资和贷款，并不违背垄断资本保持最大限度利润的法则。垄断资本家打算用这种政策先“淘汰”中小企业和非垄断资本系统的企业，制造失业，降低工资和米价，把危机的一切损失转嫁给人民。但是，在金融“紧缩”期间，集中贷款仍然通过日本银行的补充信用贷款而得到加强；在“紧缩”财政预算中，军事费和对主要垄断资本集团的投资和贷款都得到保证。
    宇佐美诚次郎着重指出：这种政策正是要建立美国所要求的美日“共同防御援助协定”体制，即高速度地加强日本军国主义，并使美国的过剩商品和资本侵入国内市场，把美国的经济危机转嫁在日本身上。在“紧缩”政策正在推行的时候，美国的“经济援助”的魔掌已向日本伸出来了，它将逐渐变成加强从属性的战争经济体制的牵引力。
    宇佐美诚次郎最后说：但是，这种使人民日益贫困的为复活军国主义服务的“紧缩”政策是不能顺利执行下去的，它必然会一天天加深国内外的各种矛盾，特别是越来越违反广大的各阶层人民的切身利益。
