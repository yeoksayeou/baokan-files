    Closer to Life
    By our reporter An Gang

    In our factory Party organizations, there are two different working methods.

    Some Party organizations' main activities are holding all kinds of meetings, listening to reports, and issuing instructions. They like to shut themselves in rooms and always hold meetings, but they cannot realize the Party's vivid leadership by closely connecting with the masses' lives.

    Some Party organizations are the opposite: they put their main activities on the maximum contact with the masses, and never let empty talk and things on paper replace the flexible and vivid leadership drawn from life.

    A comrade from Shenyang told me about the life of a factory Party committee secretary:

    "He gets up early in the morning and starts a meeting at six o'clock. The meeting does not have a specific agenda, it can only be given a general name, called: 'Unifying Thoughts', which is actually a 'hodgepodge'. Every time he eats breakfast, he enters the dining hall with the heavy feeling of 'the meeting is not over, and the problem has not been finally solved'. People can't see a lively and happy smile on his face. Wherever he goes, the air becomes dull and unnatural. After eating, he returns to the office and doesn't even bother to read the newspaper carefully, and he starts another meeting, maybe one, maybe two, or even three. Anyway, when the lunch whistle sounds at twelve o'clock, the meeting is still not over.

      "In the afternoon, the Party committee secretary's body can't take it anymore. He is no longer in the mood to go to the workshop, get close to the workers, and of course, he is even less willing to take a look at the factory corner that has changed its appearance, or listen to the sound of the machines running.

    "The Party committee secretary is a person who is loyal to his work. Every night, except for the guards on the gate, everyone in the factory enters the land of sleep, and the lights in the Party committee secretary's and the factory director's rooms are still shining. They are still working, of course, a lot of time is spent in meetings."

    This passage may be a bit exaggerated, but it raises a question with universal significance:

    Should Party workers (including Party committee secretaries) live like this?

    Some people say: "What can be done? Don't forget that he is the Party committee secretary, he has to do ideological work, may I ask, how can ideological work be done without holding meetings?"

    Let me give another example to answer this question:

    Some of the leadership methods of Comrade Mo Wenxiang, the Party committee secretary of the former Plant 53 (he was selected as a labor model of Shenyang City in 1954, and recently elected as a representative of the National People's Congress), can be said to be an example of getting closer to life and realizing vivid leadership.

    In 1947, the entire territory of Northeast China had not yet been liberated. Comrade Mo Wenxiang was ordered by the Party to leave the army to run a small mobile factory. He was completely a "white hat" (layman) for doing industry at that time. How to break through this difficulty? He personally went to the workers to understand their thoughts and found that the workers' thoughts were very chaotic. Some people had no confidence in their work and future, and some had a simple employment perspective. He further studied the social background of these workers and found that many of them had suffered from the oppression of the ruling class and were people who had been "flattened" by the old society, which made him think of trying to adopt the method of "speaking out grievances and making meritorious deeds" from the army. After the grievance-telling movement began, the workers were all involved in the movement. Mo Wenxiang educated the workers, and soon everyone automatically demanded to make meritorious deeds in production. The Party grasped the masses politically, but in order to consolidate and improve the Party's leadership over the masses, it was not enough to rely solely on grievance-telling. At this time, Mo Wenxiang was determined to take off his "white hat". He was with the workers all day long, learning how to operate machines from the workers, learning various production knowledge, and studying how to improve production from practice. The workers personally saw the difference between the new and old factories, and their enthusiasm for production rose, and finally completed the arduous task assigned by the Party under the most difficult conditions. It was precisely because Comrade Mo Wenxiang learned and led from life practice that when Shenyang was liberated and he was sent to lead a large factory, after he talked to the workers in the workshop for the first time, the workers said: "This person is an expert."

    Now, Comrade Mo Wenxiang is leading the production work of a modern enterprise. Most of his time is not spent in meetings, but in the workshop, living with technicians and workers to study production issues. At the end of one month, a workshop suddenly announced that their component production could not catch up with the monthly progress stipulated by the factory, which meant that the entire factory would not be able to complete the national plan due to their failure to complete the progress. Mo Wenxiang asked the workshop director to talk to him, and the workshop director said: "There are too many difficulties, and there is no way to complete the task." Mo Wenxiang asked the workshop director to solicit the opinions of the workers. The workshop director reported: "The workers also said that there is no way to complete the task." So, he went to the workshop himself to explain the factory's production situation in detail to the workers. He said: "Other workshops and groups have already completed their progress, can you let yourself lag behind others? If a component cannot be produced, it will affect the factory's completion of the plan, can you let your work affect the factory's failure to complete the plan?" The workers were encouraged, and their answer was: "The whole factory is waiting for us, we will never fall behind." Mo Wenxiang also studied specific measures with the workshop cadres and workers. That night, the workshop's production progress began to rise, the lag was caught up, and the factory's task was completed on time.

    Once, a workshop wanted to install a new piece of equipment. In order not to affect production, it was stipulated that it should be installed during rest days. After hearing this, the workshop cadres thought it was impossible, saying that "it would take at least three or four days of work." Mo Wenxiang went to the workshop and personally consulted with experienced old workers. After everyone's research, they confidently believed that "it can be completed in one day." The workshop cadres did not believe it. They said to the old workers: "If you promise to complete it, you will be responsible if you don't complete it." As a result, the matter was exactly the opposite of their estimation. The workers not only guaranteed to complete it within the planned time, but also two hours ahead of schedule.

    This is not a miracle, this is our real life. Mo Wenxiang said: "Like the laws of nature, whenever you encounter difficulties, as long as you believe in people and rely on people, you will always find a way to solve the difficulties from real life, and there will always be advanced people, advanced ideas, and advanced experiences to defeat the conservative and backward ideas in front of you and relieve the difficulties."

    Mo Wenxiang's attitude towards life is not blind. He treats life with a critical attitude, which also reflects the Party's leadership over life.

    In the implementation of planned management in the factory, regular cadre study meetings were organized, and booklets on planned management documents were distributed. Mo Wenxiang was not satisfied with doing these, nor was he satisfied with the fact that people attended the meetings on time to study. He personally participated in the cadre study meetings, and at the meetings, he discovered a situation: many people spread out the documents in front of them, seemingly studying, but upon closer inspection, these people were not studying at all. Some people anxiously looked at their watches from time to time; some people kept looking outside, as if something urgent was waiting for him; some people looked at the documents with impatient eyes… As the end of the study session was approaching, many people hurriedly packed up their documents and prepared to leave as if they were relieved of a heavy burden. However, Mo Wenxiang did not announce the adjournment of the meeting. He seized on this fact in life and raised a new question to everyone: "Our cadres are now diligent in their mouths, diligent in their legs, and diligent in their ears, but they are not diligent in their minds, which is a fatal danger. Soviet experts said: 'We must use our brains to lead modern industry.' The leadership methods of handicraft experience will never do a good job."

    So, he convened a heart-to-heart talk meeting for leading cadres. Everyone said that they were busy, chaotic, and tired at work, and they were not happy even after putting in a lot of effort. Some comrades were busy from morning to night, solving problems, and holding various meetings, but they never calmly thought about the work they had done. Sometimes they were so busy that they didn't even have time to discuss with their leading comrades, but problems often occurred in their work.

      "We must use our brains to manage the factory," this became the unanimous call of the factory's leading cadres. Everyone declared war on the handicraft style and proposed measures to improve their work.

    This is vivid leadership, it comes from the masses and goes to the masses. It is impossible for leaders to achieve this by only listening to reports without getting close to life.

    The leaders of the factory Party organization should live among the broad masses of Party members and non-Party members, be familiar with the masses, understand the masses, and seize on various things in life to improve the masses. Party workers should treat the surrounding things with a high degree of political sensitivity, and should seize on the most decisive things as the basis for leadership. When others do not yet recognize the new things in life, the Party organization should be the first to discover it, give it a correct evaluation, find out its universal significance, and enable it to develop in a broader direction. Party workers should go to the places where people produce and work, and to the places where people live (eating, sleeping, cultural entertainment, etc.). They should use their own eyes (not relying on other people's eyes) to observe people's labor, use all their strength to learn from the workers, and then concentrate and lead the workers. Party leaders should be good at searching for the answers to all unsolvable problems from the treasures of life. This is the basis of vivid and concrete leadership.

    In everyday labor life, you can see some Party members and workers anxiously arguing about a technical innovation drawing that has not been completed, and advanced ideas are fighting against conservative ideas; some workers suddenly show distressed expressions on their faces, and production performance begins to decline; some people are in high spirits, have found an important trick, or have solved a long-standing ideological problem, and production records have been greatly improved… Party workers should actively participate in such a rich and constantly changing real life, help them solve problems and overcome difficulties, discover the buds of various fresh things, and enrich their own leadership. Therefore, Party workers, first of all, the Party committee secretary, must not only be familiar with every Party member and worker, understand their general ideological and living conditions, but also know the changes of each person at all times. Party workers should create such conditions so that every ordinary Party member and ordinary worker can meet and talk with the person in charge of the Party directly without any cumbersome procedures or obstacles, and pour out to the Party what they are unwilling or dare not talk to others.

    Unfortunately, the Party committee secretary mentioned earlier who buried himself in meetings and lost contact with the masses is not too isolated. I once visited another Party committee secretary and asked him if he often went to the workshop. His answer was: There are many things and meetings above, and he has not been down there for three months. What do you rely on to understand the situation? Not relying on your own eyes, but relying on the people sent to the workshop to understand the situation and the reports of the workshop branch secretaries. He also rarely talks to workers because he has no free time, and his time is filled with so-called things and meetings from above. As far as I know, there are many Party committee secretaries who have not been close to ordinary Party members and workers for a long time. Some people, even if they go to the workshop, are only there to rush production tasks and urge components, not to get close to the workers and understand their thoughts, labor, and life. I have asked some advanced workers, and they also rarely had individual talks with the Party committee secretary.

    Many comrades feel that it is impossible for Party workers to have close and extensive contact with the masses. It can be said with certainty: this is possible. Mo Wenxiang did this. During the Sino-Soviet joint management period of the China Changchun Railway, Comrade Sidrov, the Soviet director of the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, was familiar with thousands of workers and their families in less than a year of working in the factory, and specifically cared about everyone, and was warmly and enthusiastically supported by all the workers. The reason why the leaders of the Party organization are isolated from the masses and fresh things in life is mainly because they have created obstacles for themselves.

      Some Party organization leaders always want to build a decent agency with a large organization, many levels, and secretaries, Party committee offices, various department offices, and section chiefs and staff under the ministers. In the Party's organs, many people are busy every day with "carrying out instructions from above and reporting to below," "filling out forms," and "drafting summaries and reports"... Everything seems to be in order, but there is one biggest shortcoming: the larger the agency, the more ordinary Party members and the masses dare not come in.

    Some comrades in enterprise Party organizations also have a wrong view that the Party's work is to hold meetings, and only holding meetings can "unify thoughts," and only holding meetings can solve various problems. The mechanization of the Party's leading organization also requires more meetings. As a result, the Party's weekly schedule is filled with various large and small meetings. As a result, Party workers cannot carry out their work around the production and life of Party members and workers, and can only shut themselves in the office and talk endlessly in long meetings that may not be able to solve problems, making it impossible for the masses to approach the leaders of the Party organization. Some workers said: "Some things always feel that it is better to find the Party committee secretary to solve them (some of which are criticisms of the factory director and administration), but as soon as you enter the door, you are blocked by the secretary: 'The secretary is in a meeting.' 'When will it be over?' 'It's not certain'. If you can't find it once, you go there again for the second time and they are still in a meeting, and the third time they are still in a meeting. From then on, they gave up the idea of ​​finding the Party committee secretary."

    We do not generally oppose meetings. Meeting is one of the most important working methods in Party life, and no one can deny its solemn significance. Meetings should be a manifestation of collective leadership. We should use the form of meetings to concentrate everyone's experience and wisdom. To this end, everyone must be connected to the working class and production reality to the maximum extent, and everyone must reflect the creative spirit and collective experience of the working class. Without this, the people who hold the meeting can only repeat well-known old tunes there and cannot solve problems in accordance with the Party's principles of collective leadership. All Party meetings are to promote the sense of ownership of Party members and inspire them to raise and solve problems in a spirit of responsibility to the Party. If the Party's leaders cannot go deep into the actual life, closely contact the Party members, and prepare the meeting with them and find ways to solve the problems, then it may be "holding meetings for the sake of holding meetings," and it is impossible to seek solutions to the problems at such meetings. This kind of empty talk and unsolved meeting should be resolutely opposed.

    The leaders of the enterprise Party organization should put their positions in the right place: do not sit in the office all day long; do not engage in overlapping organizational forms, artificially creating obstacles to the Party organization's contact with Party members and non-Party masses; do not let endless and unprepared meetings entangle themselves, so that they have to rely on meetings to live their lives. The Party's leadership should be dissolved in people's life actions, and it should form a great force in everyone's thoughts and life. The door of the Party organization should be opened wide to welcome everyone and guide everyone to contribute their own strength to the country better.

    更接近生活
    本报记者　安岗
    在我们工厂党组织中有着两种不同的工作方法。
    有些党组织的主要活动是召开各式各样的会议，听取汇报，发布指示。他们喜欢关在屋子里老是开会，而不能从与群众生活紧密联系中实现党的生动的领导。
    有些党组织与此相反：他们把自己的主要活动放在同群众的最大限度的联系上，从来不让空谈和纸面上的东西来代替从生活中汲取的灵活生动的领导。
    沈阳一位同志对我谈起一个工厂党委书记的生活情况：
    “他早晨一起来，六点钟就开起会来，会议并没有一定的议程，只能起个笼统的名字，叫做：‘统一思想’，实际上是‘大杂烩’。他每次吃早饭都是带着‘会议没有开完，问题没有最后解决’的沉重心情进入饭厅的。人们看不到他脸上有过活泼愉快的笑容，他到那里，那里的空气就沉闷、不自然起来，吃完饭，回到办公室，连报纸也顾不得细看，他就又开起会来，也许是一个会，也许是两个甚至三个会，反正到了十二点鸣起吃饭汽笛的时候，会议总还是未开完。
      “到了下午，党委书记身体有些支持不住了，他已经没有心情下车间，接近工人，当然更懒得去看一看工厂那一角落变了模样，或是听一听机器转动的声音。
    “党委书记是一个忠实于工作的人。每天晚上，除了大门上的警卫人员以外全厂的人都进入了睡乡，党委书记和厂长的屋子仍然放射着灯光。他们还在工作，当然，很多的时间是在开会。”
    这一段话，说得也许有些过分，但，它却提出了一个带有普遍意义的问题：
    党的工作者（包括党委书记）应当这样生活吗？
    有些人说：“这有什么办法呢？不要忘记他是党委书记，他要作思想工作，请问，作思想工作，不开会怎么能成？”
    让我再举另外一个例子来回答这个问题：
    前五三厂党委书记莫文祥同志（他被选为一九五四年沈阳市劳动模范，最近当选全国人民代表大会代表）的一些领导方法可以说是接近生活，实现生动领导的一个榜样。
    一九四七年东北全境尚未解放，莫文祥同志奉党的命令离开部队去搞一个小型流动工厂。对于搞工业他当时完全是“白帽子”（外行）。怎样突破这个难关呢？他亲自到工人中去了解他们的思想，发现工人思想很混乱，有人对工作和前途没有信心，有的是单纯的雇佣观点。他进一步研究了这些工人的社会出身，发现他们很多人受尽统治阶级压迫，是一些被旧社会“压扁”了的人，这使他想到试着采用部队开展“诉苦立功”的办法。诉苦运动开始后，工人们都卷进到运动中去。莫文祥对工人进行了教育，很快大家就自动要求生产立功。党在政治上掌握了群众，可是要想巩固和提高党对群众的领导，光凭诉苦是不够的。这时，莫文祥决心要去掉他的“白帽子”。他成天和工人们一起，向工人学习操纵机器，学习各种生产知识，从实践中研究提高生产的问题。工人们亲眼看到新旧工厂的不同，生产热情高涨起来，终于在最困难条件下完成了党所交给的艰巨的任务。正因为莫文祥同志从生活实践中去学习和领导，因此，当沈阳解放，他被派去领导一个大工厂时，他第一次下车间同工人谈话后，工人们就说：“这个人是内行。”
    现在，莫文祥同志领导着近代化的企业生产工作。他的最大部分时间不是开会，而是在车间，同技术人员、工人们生活在一起研究生产问题。有一个月的月末，一个车间突然宣布他们的部件生产没有办法赶上全厂规定的月进度，这就是说，全厂将因他们的完不成进度而不能完成国家计划。莫文祥找车间主任来谈，车间主任说：“困难太多，没有办法完成任务”。莫文祥要车间主任去征求工人的意见，车间主任汇报说：“工人们同样说没有办法完成任务”。于是，他自己到车间向工人详细地说明了全厂生产状况。他说：“别的车间、小组都已经完成了自己的进度，你们能让自己落后于别人吗？一种部件生产不出来就影响到全厂完成计划，你们能让自己的工作来影响全厂完不成计划吗？”工人被鼓动起来，他们的回答是：“全厂都等着我们，我们决不落后”。莫文祥又同车间干部、工人研究了具体措施，当天晚上车间生产进度便开始上升，拉下的进度赶上去了，全厂任务按时完成了。
    有一次一个车间要安装一项新的设备，为了不影响生产，规定要利用休息日来安装。车间干部听了，都认为办不到，说是“最少也得用三四天功夫”。莫文祥到车间亲自找有经验的老工人商量，大家研究结果，肯定地认为：“一天可以完成”。车间干部不相信，他们对老工人说：“你答应能完成，到时候完不成，可要负责任”。结果事情同他们的估计恰恰相反，工人们不但保证在计划规定的时间内完成了，而且还提前了两小时。
    这不是什么奇迹，这就是我们的实在的生活。莫文祥说：“像自然规律一样，凡是遇到困难的时候，只要你相信人、依靠人，总会从实际生活中找到解决困难的办法，总会出现先进人物、先进思想和先进经验，来打倒你面前的保守落后思想，解除困难的。”
    莫文祥对待生活所持的态度不是盲目的。他用批判的态度来对待生活，这也就体现了党对生活的领导。
    工厂在实行计划管理中组织了定期的干部学习会，印发了有关计划管理文件的小册子。莫文祥并不以作了这些为满足，他也没有以每次人们按时到会学习为满足。他亲自参加干部学习会议，在会上，他发现一种情况：很多人都是把文件摊开摆在自己的面前，表面看好像是在学习，细看原来这些人根本没有学习，有人焦急地不时看着表；有的人眼睛不断向外观看，好像有什么紧急事情在等着他；有的人用不耐烦的眼光看着文件……学习结束的时间快到了，很多人如释重担似地急忙收拾起文件准备离开。但是，莫文祥没有宣布散会，他抓住生活中这样一个事实向大家提出了一个新问题：“我们的干部现在作到了嘴勤，腿勤，耳朵勤，就是脑子不勤，这是致命的危险。苏联专家说：‘要用脑子去领导近代化工业’。手工业经验主义的领导方法是永远不会搞好工作的”。
    于是，他召集领导干部开谈心会。大家都说到工作忙、乱、累，费了劲还干得不顺心。有的同志一天忙到晚，解决问题，开各种会议，可是从来对自己作过的工作没有冷静下来仔细思索一下，有时忙得连同领导同志共同商量的时间都没有，可是，工作却是经常出问题。
      “我们要用脑子来管工厂”，这成了工厂领导干部的一致呼声，大家向手工业作风宣战，提出了改进工作的措施。
    这是生动的领导，它从群众中来，到群众中去。领导者要作到这一点，光听汇报而不接近生活，是永远不成的。
    工厂党组织的领导者，应当这样生活在党员与非党员广大群众之中，熟悉群众、了解群众、抓住生活中的各种事物去提高群众。党的工作者要以高度的政治敏感来对待周围事物，要抓住其中最有决定意义的东西作为领导的基础。当别人还不认识生活中的新事物时，党组织应当第一个发现它，给它以正确的估价，找出它的普遍意义，使它能够向更广阔的方向发展。党的工作者要到人们生产和工作的地方去，到人们生活（吃饭、睡觉、文化娱乐等）的地方去。应该用自己的眼睛（而不是靠别人的眼睛）去观察人们的劳动，用自己的全副力量去向工人学习，然后集中起来领导工人。党的领导者要善于从生活的宝藏中去寻找一切不能解决的问题的答案。这是生动的具体的领导的基础。
    在每天的劳动生活中，都可以看到有一些党员和工人焦灼不安地在争论着一个没有完成的技术革新的图样，先进的思想同保守的思想正在斗争；有的工人脸上忽然流露出苦恼的神情，生产成绩开始下降了；有的人精神昂扬，找到了一个重要的窍门或者是解决了思想上的什么久悬未决的问题，生产纪录大大地提高了……党的工作者应该主动地参与到这样丰富的不断变化的现实生活中去，帮助他们解决问题克服困难，发现各种新鲜事物的萌芽，来充实和丰富自己的领导。因此，党工作人员首先是党委书记不仅要熟悉每个党员和工人，了解他们一般的思想状况和生活状况，而且要知道每个人的时时刻刻的变化。党工作人员要创造出这样的条件，使每一个普通的党员和普通的工人，都能不经任何繁琐的手续和阻难而直接同党的负责人见面谈心，把自己心中的不愿或不敢向别人谈的话来向党倾诉。
    可惜的是，像前面谈到的那位把自己埋藏在会议中而和群众失掉了联系的党委书记，并不是太个别的。我曾经访问过另外一位党委书记，问他是不是经常下车间去。他的回答是：上面的事情多、会议多，已经三个月没有下去了。靠什么了解情况呢，不是靠自己的眼睛，而是靠派到车间去了解情况的人和车间支部书记的汇报。他也很少和工人谈话，因为没有空闲，时间都被所谓上面的事情和会议挤满了。据我所知，有不少的党委书记就是这样长期不同普通党员和工人接近。有些人即使到车间去，也只是为了突击生产任务、催部件，而不是去接近工人，了解他们的思想、劳动和生活。我曾问过一些先进工人，他们同样是很少同党委书记作过个别谈话。
    有不少同志觉得，要党工作人员同群众有密切的广泛的接触是不可能的。可以肯定的说：这是可能的。莫文祥这样做了。中长铁路中苏共管时期，大连机车车辆修理厂苏联厂长希德洛夫同志，他在工厂工作不到一年就熟悉了几千个工人和他们的家属，具体地关心到每一个人，得到了全体工人亲切的热烈的拥护。党组织的领导者所以和群众、和生活中的新鲜事物隔绝起来，主要是因为他们自己为自己制造了障碍。
      有些党组织领导者总想搞个像样的机关，机构大、层次多，安设上秘书、党委办公室、各部办公室、部长之下还有科长、干事。党的机关中天天有不少人忙于“承上启下”、“填写表格”、“草拟总结、报告”……。一切看来都很像样子，但是有一个最大的缺点：机关越大，普通党员、群众也就越来越不敢进来了。
    企业党组织的一些同志还有一种错误看法，以为党的工作就是开会，只有开会才能“统一思想”，只有开会才能解决各种问题。党的领导组织的机关化也要求更多的会议。于是，在党的每周的日程表上挤满了各种大大小小的会议。于是，党的工作人员就不能围绕着党员和工人的生产、生活来进行工作，只能关在办公室里滔滔不绝地开那些冗长而不一定能解决问题的会议，使群众无法接近党组织的领导者。有些工人说：“有些事总觉得要找党委书记才好解决（其中有一些是对厂长和行政上的批评），但是，一进门就被秘书挡住了：‘书记正在开会。’‘什么时候开完？’‘没有一定’。一趟找不着，第二趟再去还是在开会，第三趟还是开会。从此，就打消了找党委书记的念头了。”
    我们并不一般地反对开会。开会，是党生活中最重要的工作方法之一，任何人都不能否认它的严肃意义。会议应当是集体领导的表现。我们应当利用会议的形式来集中每个人的经验和智慧。为此，就得要每个人最大限度地同工人阶级同生产实际联系，就要每个人体现出工人阶级的创造精神和集体经验。如果没有这一条，那么，开会的人就只能在那里重复人所共知的老调而不能按照党的集体领导原则去解决问题。党的一切会议都是为了发扬党员主人翁的感觉，激发他们以对党负责的精神提出问题解决问题。如果党的领导者不能深入到实际生活中去，密切同党员的联系，同他们一起去准备会议，寻找解决问题的办法，那么，就有可能是“为开会而开会”，在这样的会议上就不可能寻求出解决问题的办法。这种空谈的不解决问题的会议是应该受到坚决的反对的。
    企业党组织的领导者要把位置摆正：不要成天坐机关；不要搞重叠的组织形式，人为地制造党组织同党内外群众联系的障碍；不要让无尽无休的无准备的会议缠住自己，以致只好靠着会议来过日子。党的领导应当溶化在人们的生活行动之中，要使它在每一个人的思想和生活中形成伟大的力量。党组织的大门要大大敞开，迎接每一个人，指引每一个人去更好地为国家贡献自己的力量。
