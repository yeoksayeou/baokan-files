The results of the recent general election and the enthusiastic discussion of the draft constitution have proved that the people's democratic system is superior to all old systems and has won the support of the entire people.
    The article continued: This powerful force has received the support of the people of the world, and it will surely smash all the provocative actions and conspiracies of US imperialism, and will surely liberate Taiwan and defend the integrity of China's entire territory. This powerful force will defeat any aggressive actions of military alliances aimed at attacking China and disrupting peace in Asia, filling all nations in the world who are fighting for their own liberation with confidence and greatly inspiring them.
