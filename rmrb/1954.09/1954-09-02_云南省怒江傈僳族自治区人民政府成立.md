Li Qunjie, Deputy Director of the Ethnic Affairs Committee of the Yunnan Provincial People's Government, delivered a congratulatory speech at the meeting. He said: The people of all ethnic groups in the Nujiang area have long suffered from the oppression and trampling of reactionary rulers, were displaced and impoverished, and fell into backwardness and poverty. In the future, the government will further help people of all ethnic groups develop production and improve their lives.

When the celebration meeting for the establishment of the Autonomous Region People's Government was held on August 24, people of all ethnic groups poured in from both sides of the Nujiang River. Lai Maizi, a 70-year-old Lisu man, carried a rooster and traveled for two days to present it to the People's Government. When the government members appeared on the rostrum, the children presented flowers, the young girls presented hand-embroidered satchels, and the hunters presented their own crossbows and quivers, fully demonstrating the love of the people of all ethnic groups for the Autonomous Region People's Government and their determination to defend the frontier of the motherland.
