The workers of the Jiang'an Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, which has won the national locomotive and rolling stock repair factory's rotating red flag three times in a row, have recently achieved major victories on both the flood control and production fronts, and have been rewarded by the Ministry of Railways. The Jiang'an Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory is located right behind the Yangtze River levee and is considered a specially dangerous area of the city. The floodwater level was two feet higher than the factory windows. In this emergency, the factory first drew people to protect a section of the levee and support flood control in other urban areas. The workers who remained in the factory launched enthusiastic amateur voluntary labor, quickly completed the factory's flood control measures such as building sluice gates and raising machinery, and on this basis, insisted on carrying out production according to plan, checking the production progress every day.

On August 10 (the factory's rest day), a surge of floodwater suddenly appeared beside the pond in front of the factory, eroding the soil on both sides. The situation was very critical. More than 900 members of the emergency rescue team who did not leave production went to the danger zone within minutes, carrying timbers, moving stones, and lifting sacks to fight the flood. Young worker Meng Jie fell into a water hole because the ground collapsed and was washed out of the hole by the flood. Everyone rescued him desperately, and the leak was finally blocked in four hours. The factory resumed production as usual the next day.

From August 14th, the Wuhan Municipal Flood Control Headquarters successively assigned them four batches of iron anchor manufacturing tasks, totaling 1,040, weighing more than 170 tons. This task was more than three times higher than the monthly output of the factory's forging workshop. All workshops took the initiative to draw people to support the forging workshop, universally launched labor competitions, and implemented hourly production plans. In this arduous flood control and production task, the workers actively looked for shortcuts and tapped potential, overcoming the difficulties of insufficient materials and manpower. When there was no iron material, foreman Wei Zhendong suggested using scrapped arch plates. When welding rods were used up, engineer Yu Diantao suggested replacing them with iron strips cut from scrap steel pipes. Forger Zhu Shaoyin suggested implementing assembly line operations for firing materials, which doubled the production efficiency of the steam hammer. Welder Xin Jixuan took the lead in implementing the double-handed electric welding method, reducing the time to weld an iron anchor from three hours to 1.2 hours. As a result of such production improvements, workers generally did the work of five people with three people. The task of manufacturing iron anchors was completed in only thirteen days and nights. In July and August, the factory workers not only completed the flood control tasks but also completed the national production plan on a weekly and monthly basis, overhauling one locomotive and sixteen freight cars. The Ministry of Railways awarded them 50 million yuan.

    江岸机车车辆修理厂职工在防汛斗争中
    超额完成七八两月生产任务
    连获三次全国机车车辆修理工厂循环优胜红旗的江岸机车车辆修理工厂职工，最近两个月在防汛与生产两条战线上取得重大胜利，得到铁道部的奖励。江岸机车车辆修理工厂处在紧靠着长江堤防的后面，属于全市特险区，洪水水位比工厂窗户还高两尺。在这种紧急情况下，该厂首先抽出人来保护一段堤防与支援其他市区防汛。留厂的职工则展开了热烈的业余义务劳动，迅速完成了修筑闸门与垫高机器等本厂防汛措施，并在这个基础上坚持按计划进行生产，逐日检查生产进度。
    八月十日（该厂休息日），工厂门前的池塘边突然冒出一股洪水，冲得两边的泥土直往下垮，情况非常危急。全厂九百多名不脱离生产的抢险队员，几分钟之内都上了险地，扛道木，搬石头，抬麻包，奋力抢救。青年工人孟捷因为地面崩陷而掉入水洞，又被洪水冲出洞来。大家奋不顾身地抢救，漏洞终于在四小时内被堵塞住了。该厂第二天仍照常进行生产。
    从八月十四日起，武汉市防汛指挥部连续布置他们四批制造铁锚的任务，共一千零四十个，重一百七十多吨。这个任务比该厂锻冶车间一个月的生产量还高出三倍以上。各车间都主动抽人来支援锻冶车间，普遍展开劳动竞赛，实行按小时计划生产。在这艰巨的防汛与生产任务中，职工们都积极找窍门，挖潜力，克服了材料与人力不够的困难。铁料没有了，领工员魏振东建议将报废的拱板加以利用。焊条用光了，工程师于殿涛建议用废钢管剪成的铁条代替。锻工朱绍银建议烧料实行流水作业，使汽锤的生产效率提高一倍以上。焊工辛继轩带头实行双手电焊法，将焊一个铁锚的时间由三小时缩短为一点二十分钟。这样改进生产的结果，职工们一般都作到三人干五人的活，制造铁锚的任务，仅以十三昼夜的时间就完成了。该厂职工在七、八两个月，不仅完成了防汛任务，同时逐旬逐月完成了国家生产计划，超额修理了一台机车、十六台货车。铁道部奖给他们五千万元。
