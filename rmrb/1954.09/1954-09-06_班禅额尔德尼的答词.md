Panchen Erdeni's Reply

Vice Chairman Zhu, Premier Zhou, Respected Leaders and Gentlemen:

Today, as the Dalai Lama and I, representing the Tibetan people, are about to attend the first session of the First National People's Congress in our great motherland's capital—Beijing, we are deeply grateful for the warm concern and banquet hosted by the central leaders. Now, with the most excited and joyful mood, I extend my sincere thanks and high respect to all leaders.

The convening of this National People's Congress is the result of the brilliant victories achieved by New China in all aspects in the short span of five years under the correct leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China. It will bring greater happiness and brightness to all fraternal nationalities in the country, especially the Tibetan nationality. During this trip, I have personally witnessed the thriving new atmosphere in Xining, Lanzhou, Xi'an, and our great motherland's capital. The market is becoming more and more prosperous, modern construction is increasing day by day, and the lives of the broad masses of people are constantly improving, which has increased my infinite hope and made me feel honored. I believe that Tibet will also continue to prosper and develop like other parts of the motherland in the future. From now on, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and our beloved and great leader Chairman Mao, we will resolutely continue to carry forward the anti-imperialist patriotic spirit, further strengthen the unity of Tibet internally and between the Han and Tibetan fraternal nationalities, and strive to the end to thoroughly implement the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet and build a new Tibet.

Cheers to the great unity of all nationalities.

Cheers to the health of Vice Chairman Zhu, Premier Zhou, and all leaders.

Finally, we shout:

Long live the Communist Party of China.

Long live the great leader of all nationalities, Chairman Mao.

    班禅额尔德尼的答词朱副主席、周总理、各位首长及各位先生：
    今天，在达赖喇嘛和我代表西藏人民到我们伟大的祖国首都——北京即将出席首届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的时候，承蒙中央各位首长对我们热烈关怀与设宴招待，这是我们深刻感激的。现在我以最兴奋愉快的心情，向各位首长致以恳切的感谢和崇高的敬意。
    这次全国人民代表大会会议的召开，是新中国在我们各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席和中国共产党的正确领导下，短短五年来在各方面获得辉煌胜利的结果。它将给全国各兄弟民族、特别是西藏民族带来更大的幸福与光明。这次仅我沿途看到的西宁、兰州、西安以及我们伟大的祖国首都，都呈现着蒸蒸日上的新气象。市面日益繁荣，现代化的建设一天天增加，广大人民的生活不断提高，使我增加了无限希望并感到光荣，我相信西藏将来也会像祖国各地一样不断的繁荣和发展起来。今后，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和我们敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，坚决继续发扬反帝国主义的爱国精神，更进一步加强西藏内部和汉藏兄弟民族的团结，为彻底实现和平解放西藏办法的协议建设祖国的新西藏而奋斗到底。
