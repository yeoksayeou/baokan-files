Dear comrades and friends,

The Government Delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam extends its warm respects to the entire Chinese people, the Government of the People’s Republic of China, the Chinese Communist Party, and Chairman Mao Zedong.

We are deeply honored to have been delegated by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to participate in the celebration of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Throughout our journey and up to our arrival in Beijing today, we have been greeted with enthusiastic hospitality and grand welcomes by the Chinese government and people, which has deeply moved and grateful us.

As the First National People’s Congress of the People’s Republic of China has just adopted the first Constitution of the People’s Republic of China, and as the Chinese people are striving to lay the foundation for socialism and realize the First Five-Year Plan, we arrive in Beijing. We extend our warm congratulations to the First National People’s Congress of the People’s Republic of China and wish the Chinese people success in completing these glorious and great tasks.

In our Vietnam, thanks to the wise leadership of the Vietnam Labor Party, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and President Ho Chi Minh, the struggle of the Vietnamese people has achieved significant victories; thanks to the warm sympathy and support of the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries, as well as peace-loving people around the world, Vietnam has restored peace. The Vietnamese people, together with the peoples of the fraternal countries of Laos and Cambodia, are striving to consolidate peace, achieve unification, and complete independence and democracy; and are fighting to crush the conspiracies of the imperialist warmongers and their lackeys who are attempting and are using various means to undermine the armistice agreement.

Although our struggle is long and arduous, we are deeply convinced that final victory belongs to the Vietnamese people, just as we are convinced that the Chinese people have achieved a great victory after a long struggle, and we firmly believe that the bright future of peace-loving and democratic humanity will be realized.

Today, we are ordered by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to come to Beijing to participate in the grand celebration of the founding of the People’s Republic of China and to take this opportunity to convey the love and gratitude of the Vietnamese people to the Chinese people, the Government of the People’s Republic of China, the Chinese Communist Party, and Chairman Mao Zedong; and to further strengthen the fraternal traditional friendship and solidarity between the peoples of Vietnam and China within the peace and democracy camp headed by the great Soviet Union.

Long live the unbreakable friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and China! Long live the People’s Republic of China, the pillar of the Asian peace movement! Long live the victory of the world peace movement headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the wise leader of the Chinese people and the sun of the East!

    越南政府代表团团长黄明鉴的谈话亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    越南民主共和国政府代表团谨向全中国人民、中华人民共和国政府、中国共产党和毛泽东主席致以热烈的敬意。
    我们受了越南民主共和国政府的委派来参加庆祝中华人民共和国国庆五周年纪念，我们感到非常的荣幸。在整个路途中一直到今天抵达北京，我们得到中国政府和人民热情的招待和隆重的迎接，使我们无限地振奋和感激。
    正当中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会通过了中华人民共和国第一个宪法；中国人民正在为了奠定社会主义基础而努力实现第一个五年建设计划的时候，我们到达了北京，我们谨向中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会致以热烈的祝贺，并祝中国人民胜利完成这些光荣而伟大的任务。
    在我们越南，由于越南劳动党、越南民主共和国政府和胡志明主席的英明领导，越南人民的斗争获得了重大的胜利；由于苏联、中国和各人民民主国家以及世界爱好和平人民的热烈同情和支持，越南恢复了和平。越南人民和寮国、高棉两个兄弟国家人民一起，正在为巩固和平、实现统一、完成独立和民主而努力；为粉碎帝国主义好战分子及其走狗们企图并正在用各种手段来破坏停战协定的阴谋而斗争。
    尽管我们的斗争是长期的艰苦的，但是我们深信最后胜利是属于越南人民的，正如深信中国人民经过长期斗争获得了伟大胜利一样，并坚信爱好和平、民主人类的灿烂远景一定实现。
    今天，我们奉越南民主共和国政府的命令到北京参加中华人民共和国国庆盛典并借此机会来传达越南人民对中国人民、中华人民共和国政府、中国共产党和毛泽东主席的敬爱和感谢；进一步加强以伟大的苏联为首的和平民主阵营里的越、中两国人民间兄弟般的传统友谊和团结。
    越、中两国人民间牢不可破的友谊万岁，亚洲和平运动的支柱中华人民共和国万岁，以苏联为首的世界和平运动胜利万岁！
    中国人民英明的领袖、东方的太阳毛泽东主席万岁！
