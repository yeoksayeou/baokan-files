    Liberating Taiwan is the Urgent Expectation of Taiwan Compatriots
    Hu Qingjun
    The people of Taiwan eagerly hope to return to the embrace of the motherland.
    Taiwan has been China's territory since ancient times, and the people of all ethnic groups in Taiwan are compatriots of the motherland. The main ethnic group in Taiwan is the Han, followed by the Gaoshan. More than seven million Han people are mostly descendants of immigrants from Fujian and Guangdong in our country, and nearly two hundred thousand Gaoshan people are members of the loving and cooperative family of all ethnic groups in our country. They already have their own representatives participating in our national institutions.
    The people of all ethnic groups in Taiwan clearly remember the history of their ancestors opening up this island. Since historical records began, there have been various records of residents from mainland China settling in Taiwan. The Han and Gaoshan people jointly developed this island. For thousands of years, the Han compatriots in Taiwan have maintained the living habits left by their ancestors, and they live in communities in many areas. The Gaoshan compatriots in Taiwan also lead a simple and plain life, and their customs and habits are rich in the traditional colors of the Austronesian peoples.
    The people of all ethnic groups in Taiwan also painfully recall the history of being invaded and cruelly ruled by Eastern and Western colonialists. This history is also a history of their heroic struggle against the invaders for many years. The struggle of the Taiwanese people against the Dutch and Spanish colonialists in the 17th century is well known; after the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, the corrupt and incompetent Qing government ceded Taiwan to Japan, and since then the Taiwanese people have been humiliated under the cruel rule of Japanese imperialism for fifty-one years. However, the people of Taiwan are the heroic and hardworking people of the motherland, and they launched a vigorous and unyielding struggle. During the fifty-one years of Japanese occupation of Taiwan, the anti-Japanese struggle of the Taiwanese people never stopped. These heroic anti-Japanese struggles are filled with tragic stories of countless patriotic heroes.
    After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War in 1937, the Anti-Japanese National United Front led by the Chinese Communist Party was practiced in Taiwan, which greatly promoted the development of the anti-Japanese movement in Taiwan.
    The Gaoshan people of Taiwan also launched a heroic and fierce struggle against the cruel oppression of the Japanese rulers. During the fifty-one years of Japanese rule in Taiwan, there were more than 120 organized large-scale so-called "punitive expeditions" against the Gaoshan people, and each time they were resolutely repulsed by the Gaoshan people. For example, in the "Wushe Incident" in October 1930, the Japanese rulers received their due punishment from the Gaoshan people. Nevertheless, the Japanese imperialists' heinous and inhuman atrocities over the years caused heavy losses to the Gaoshan people. They were abused, massacred, and imprisoned in batches, leaving only seven tribes and less than 200,000 of the original ten or more tribes with a population of about 500,000.
    The people of Taiwan could no longer endure this barbaric rule, and they eagerly hoped to return to the embrace of the motherland. Thanks to their years of unyielding anti-Japanese struggle, and thanks to the victory of the Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japan, Japan's unconditional surrender in 1945 gave the people of Taiwan the opportunity to realize their long-cherished desire to return to the motherland. Unfortunately, however, when they returned to the motherland, they encountered Chiang Kai-shek's heinous fascist rule. The reactionary rule of the Chiang bandits aroused unparalleled hatred and anger among the people of Taiwan. In 1947, the Han and Gaoshan people of Taiwan united to launch the world-famous "February 28th" struggle, which terrified the reactionary rulers!
    In 1949, Chiang Kai-shek's fascist rule was overthrown by the Chinese people on the mainland, and Chiang Kai-shek and his remnants fled to Taiwan under the protection of the United States. The US imperialists, who openly opposed the Chinese people, invaded our territory of Taiwan after launching the Korean War in 1950. Therefore, the struggle of the Taiwanese people against the fascist rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group and the aggression of US imperialism entered a more difficult historical period.
    In the struggle of the Chinese people against foreign invaders and Japanese imperialist aggression against Taiwan, the United States has always stood on the side of the invaders, pursuing a reactionary policy of aggression. As early as 1854 (the fourth year of Xianfeng in the Qing Dynasty), American fleet commander Perry, on his way back from Japan, sent two warships to land in Keelung, Taipei, believing that the island "indeed had great value" and reported to the then US President Pierce, advocating its occupation. It was only because this opinion was rejected by the US Congress, which was still somewhat cautious at the time, that it was not realized. In 1873 (the twelfth year of Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty), Japanese aggressors sent the flagship "Takasago" to invade southern Taiwan, and received encouragement and support from the diplomatic envoys of the United States and other countries stationed in Qing. In 1895, during the Treaty of Shimonoseki after the Sino-Japanese War, the United States nominally claimed not to interfere, but in reality, it did its best to promote the Qing-Japanese peace talks and facilitate the cession of Taiwan to Japan. After the success of the peace talks, when the people of the whole of China were indignant and opposed, especially the Taiwanese people's uprising against the struggle, the US government's diplomatic envoys stationed in Qing simply ignored the just appeal of the Taiwanese soldiers and civilians to sanction Japan.
    The ambitions of the American aggressors are very obvious. It has consistently pursued a policy of aggression against our territory of Taiwan and is the deadly enemy of the Chinese people and the Taiwanese people.
    However, no imperialist can deny one fact, that is, Taiwan has been China's territory since ancient times. The "Cairo Declaration" and the "Potsdam Proclamation," personally signed by US government leaders, clearly stipulated that Taiwan belongs to China and that Taiwan should be returned to China. After the US imperialists occupied Taiwan in 1950, many capitalist countries' newspapers admitted that Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. Even the then US President Truman, before sending troops to invade Taiwan, once declared that "the United States has never had any predatory ambitions for Taiwan or other Chinese territories." Later, he openly broke his promise to such an extent that he himself announced the occupation of Taiwan.
    The lawless act of aggression by the US imperialists is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. The Chinese people resolutely protest against the US imperialists' occupation of our territory of Taiwan. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan. The Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan is a struggle to defend world peace. As Premier Zhou Enlai said: "Only by liberating Taiwan from the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous bandits... can we further guarantee peace and security in the Far East and the world."
    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, it has pursued a policy of establishing and developing diplomatic relations with any country based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty. The Chinese people believe that countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully. This basic principle has been specifically embodied in the joint statements issued by the Prime Ministers of China and India and the Prime Ministers of China and Myanmar, respectively. These two statements stipulate the five principles governing relations between the two countries. These are: mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. There is no doubt that it has become a good example for all countries to establish and develop diplomatic relations.
    The five principles of our country's peaceful foreign policy are interconnected and indivisible. Only on the basis of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, can peaceful coexistence be achieved. Therefore, any imperialist country that dares to infringe upon our territorial sovereignty can only be resolutely attacked in order to defend peace. Peace must be won, not bestowed by imperialist countries. Our struggle against the US imperialists' occupation of our territory of Taiwan for five years is first and foremost necessary to strive for peace and defend peace. From this, we can also appreciate the importance of liberating Taiwan for guaranteeing peace and security in the Far East and the world.
    Liberating Taiwan is the unanimous demand of the people of the whole country, and it is also the urgent expectation of the people of all ethnic groups in Taiwan. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the six hundred million people on the mainland of the motherland are living a peaceful, prosperous, and happy life. We will never forget that Taiwan today is a large prison! The eight million people of Taiwan are under the desperate and crazy oppression of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group, living in dire straits. The people of Taiwan are bursting with the anger of uprising and revenge, and they eagerly hope that the people of the motherland will send troops as soon as possible to rescue their suffering and realize their long-cherished desire to return to the embrace of the motherland. Our people's struggle to liberate Taiwan is a just cause. It has won the enthusiastic support and sponsorship of the vast peace-loving people of the world, and US imperialism cannot stop it. As long as the people of the whole country constantly maintain a high degree of vigilance, unite as one, and support and strengthen the struggle to liberate Taiwan in all aspects, we will surely be victorious.

    解放台湾是台湾同胞的迫切期望
    胡庆钧
    台湾人民迫切期望返回祖国的怀抱。
    台湾自古以来便是中国的领土，台湾各民族人民是祖国的同胞。台湾的民族主要是汉族，其次是高山族。七百多万汉族人民多是我国闽粤一带移民的后裔，近二十万高山族人民是我国各民族友爱合作大家庭中的一个成员，他们已经有自己的代表参加了我们的国家机构。
    台湾各民族人民清楚地记得他们祖先开辟这个岛屿的历史。自有历史记载以来，台湾就有中国大陆居民入居的种种记载。汉族和高山族人民共同开辟了这个岛屿。千百年来，台湾的汉族同胞一直保持着祖先遗留下来的生活习惯，他们在许多地区过着集族而居的生活。台湾的高山族同胞也过着简单朴素的生活，他们的风俗习惯富有着南岛民族的传统色彩。
    台湾各民族人民也沉痛地回忆着他们遭受东西方殖民者侵略和残酷统治的历史，这个历史同时也是多年来他们英勇斗争反抗侵略者的历史。台湾人民在十七世纪中反抗荷兰和西班牙殖民者的斗争是人所共知的；在甲午中日战争之后，腐败无能的满清政府把台湾割让与日本，从此台湾人民便在日本帝国主义的残酷统治下，屈辱了五十一年。但是台湾人民是祖国英勇勤劳的人民，他们展开了轰轰烈烈的誓死不屈的斗争。在日本侵台五十一年间，台湾人民的反日斗争从来没有间断过，这些英勇的反日斗争充满着无数爱国英雄们悲壮奋斗的史篇。
    一九三七年全国抗日战争爆发以后，中国共产党领导的抗日民族统一战线在台湾得到了实践，大大推动了台湾抗日运动的开展。
    台湾的高山族人民也对日本统治者的残酷压迫展开了英勇激烈的斗争。日本统治台湾的五十一年间，对高山族所进行的有组织的大规模的所谓“讨伐”在一百二十次以上，每次都遭受到高山族人民坚决的回击。如一九三○年十月的“雾社事件”，日本统治者就从高山族人民那里得到了应有的惩罚。虽然如此，日本帝国主义者多年来穷凶极恶灭绝人性的兽行使高山族人民遭受了惨重的损失，他们成批的被虐待、屠杀和监禁。使得原有十多个部落五十万左右人口的英勇人民，现在只剩下七个部落和不到二十万人。
    台湾人民是再也不能忍耐这种野蛮的统治了，他们迫切期望返回祖国的怀抱。由于他们多年来不屈不挠的反日斗争，由于中国人民抗日战争的胜利，一九四五年日本的无条件投降，使台湾人民多年来返回祖国怀抱的愿望得到了实现的机会。然而不幸的是：他们返回祖国的时候却碰到了蒋介石的万恶法西斯统治，蒋匪的反动统治激起了台湾人民无比的痛恨和愤怒。一九四七年，台湾汉族和高山族人民联合起来举行了世界闻名的“二·二八”斗争，使反动统治者为之丧胆！
    一九四九年，蒋匪的法西斯统治在大陆上被中国人民所推翻，蒋匪及其残兵败将在美国的庇护下逃往台湾。公开与中国人民为敌的美帝国主义者，在一九五○年发动了侵朝战争以后，同时侵占了我国的领土台湾。因此台湾人民反抗蒋介石卖国集团的法西斯统治和美帝国主义侵略的斗争进入了更加艰苦的历史时期。
    在中国人民反抗外国侵略者及日本帝国主义侵略台湾的斗争中，美国始终站在侵略者一方面，执行着反动的侵略政策。远在一八五四年（清咸丰四年），美国舰队司令潘利从日本返航途中，就派了两艘兵舰在台北基隆登陆，认为该岛“确有重大价值”，并向当时的美国总统披亚斯报告，主张加以占领。只是因为这个意见被当时多少还有些顾忌的美国议会所否决，才没有加以实现。一八七三年（清同治十二年），日本侵略者派旗舰“高砂号”侵入台湾南部，又获得了当时以美国为首的驻清外交使节的鼓励与支持。一八九五年，在甲午中日战争后马关议和期中，美国表面上诿称不问，实际上极力促成清日和议，促成台湾的割让与日本。而在和议成功后全中国人民悲愤反对，特别是台湾人民起义反抗的斗争中，美国政府驻清外交使节对于台湾军民要制裁日本的正义呼吁，干脆采取了不理的态度。
    美国侵略者的野心是很显然的。它一贯奉行侵略我国领土台湾的政策，是中国人民和台湾人民的死敌。
    但是，任何帝国主义者也无法否认一件事实，就是台湾自古以来便是中国的领土。美国政府领袖亲自签过字的“开罗宣言”和“波茨坦公告”都明确规定台湾属于中国，台湾应归还中国。一九五○年美帝国主义侵占台湾以后，许多资本主义国家的报纸都承认台湾是中国领土不可分离的一部分。甚至当时的美国总统杜鲁门在出兵侵占台湾以前，也曾经声明“美国对台湾或中国其他领土从无掠夺野心”。而在以后他又公然背信弃义到这种地步，由他自己来宣布侵占台湾。
    美帝国主义者这种无法无天的侵略罪行是绝对不能为中国人民所容忍的，中国人民坚决抗议美帝国主义者侵占我国领土台湾，中国人民一定要解放台湾。中国人民解放台湾的斗争就是保卫世界和平的斗争。正如周恩来总理所说：“只有把台湾从蒋介石卖国贼的统治下解放出来……才能进一步地保障远东及世界的和平和安全。”
    中华人民共和国自成立以来，就执行着根据平等互利、互相尊重领土主权的原则同任何国家建立和发展外交关系的政策。中国人民认为不同社会制度的国家是可以和平共处的。这个基本原则已具体地体现在中印两国总理和中缅两国总理分别发表的联合声明中。这两个声明里，都规定了两国之间关系的五项原则。这便是：互相尊重领土主权，互不侵犯，互不干涉内政，平等互利，和平共处。毫无疑问，它已经成为一切国家建立和发展外交关系的良好典范。
    我国推行和平外交政策的五项原则是互相联系、不可分割的。只有在互相尊重领土主权的基础上，互不侵犯，互不干涉内政，平等互利，才能做到和平共处。因此，对待任何敢于侵犯我国领土主权的帝国主义国家，就只有进行坚决的打击，这样才能保卫和平。和平是必须要争取的，不是帝国主义国家可以恩舍的。五年以来我们反抗美帝国主义者侵占我国领土台湾的斗争，首先是为了争取和平、保卫和平所必要的。从这里我们也可以体会到解放台湾对于保障远东及世界的和平与安全的重要性。
    解放台湾是全国人民一致的要求，同时也是台湾各民族人民的迫切期望。在中国共产党领导下，祖国大陆上的六亿人民正过着和平、繁荣、幸福的生活。我们决不会忘记，今天的台湾却是一座大监狱！台湾八百万人民正处于蒋介石卖国集团日暮途穷的疯狂压迫之下，过着水深火热的生活。台湾人民正迸发着起义复仇的怒火，他们迫切期望着祖国人民早日出兵，解救他们的痛苦，实现他们多年来返回祖国怀抱的愿望。我国人民解放台湾的斗争是一项正义的事业，它获得了全世界广大爱好和平的人民的热烈支持与赞助，美帝国主义是阻挡不了的。只要全国人民经常保持高度警惕，团结一致，从各方面支持与加强解放台湾的斗争，我们就一定能够胜利。
