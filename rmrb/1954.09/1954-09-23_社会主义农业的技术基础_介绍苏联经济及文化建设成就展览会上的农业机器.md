The Technical Basis of Socialist Agriculture
    ——Introducing Agricultural Machinery at the Exhibition of Achievements in Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction
    By Our Staff Reporter Yu Ming

    The Exhibition of Achievements in Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction will soon open.

    On the west square of the Soviet Exhibition Hall, various tractors and agricultural machines, all brightly decorated, are on display; these machines were recently shipped from the Soviet Union, and many of them are marked with the year of manufacture, 1954.

    Walking around the square, one gets the overall impression that in the Soviet Union, machines have replaced manual labor in everything from opening up wasteland, plowing, planting, fertilizing, weeding, to harvesting, threshing, and processing feed.

    Dozens of tractors and agricultural machines are displayed in the square. Compared with the eight hundred agricultural machines exhibited at the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition that opened in the Soviet Union last month, this is less than one-tenth; however, from these dozens of agricultural machines alone, we can see the scale of Soviet agricultural production and how meticulous the cultivation is.

    Leaving the west gate of the Heavy Industry Pavilion, the first thing people see is the world-famous strongman - the "Stalin-80" tractor. This tractor can pull two five-bottom plows or two "Stalin-6" combine harvesters. When it pulls a plow to cultivate the land, it can cultivate four hundred mu of land a day in the Soviet Union, and the plowing depth can reach nine inches. In land reclamation, it can open up one hundred and eighty mu of land a day. It drives new machines for digging tree roots and digging stones, which can dig out two hundred tree stumps and remnants in eight hours, and can dig up stones weighing 20,000 catties from the ground at a time and drag them away. The workload of one such tractor in a day can equal that of hundreds of people. Here you can also see the "DT-54" tractor and the "Belarus" tractor, both of which use diesel fuel, have low costs, and have high traction efficiency. They are tractors commonly used in the Soviet Union. In addition, there are two small rubber-wheeled tractors painted bright red, which look very smart and beautiful. They play an important role in fruit and vegetable production.

    Alongside the various tractors are agricultural machines for opening up wasteland. The plowshares, disc harrows, and the cutting blades of the root cutters on these machines are huge and solid, which is truly surprising. A two-bottom plow for reclamation can cultivate 54 centimeters wide, and it can cultivate easily on swampy shrubland; the root cutter can cultivate 25 centimeters deep, and the cutter can cut off very hard roots with one turn. The tree-planting plow pulled by a tractor can cultivate 50 centimeters wide and 75 centimeters deep, and can open a deep ditch where the plow blade passes; in the Soviet Union, this is an indispensable machine for planting fruit trees in large quantities. After seeing these capable machines, we think of how powerful the Soviet people are in conquering nature. Their specific manifestation of this powerful force is that they have reclaimed more than 10 million hectares of wasteland in five months this year.

    In the north and west of the square, you can see planters and harvesters that are more sophisticated and accurate than human hands, and whose efficiency can抵数十以至数百只手的 (match dozens or even hundreds of hands).

    As everyone knows, in order to increase agricultural production, the Soviet Union is widely promoting square cluster planting. People here see the machines that implement this planting method. A corn square planter can plant more than one hundred mu of land a day. It can plant the seeds in clusters of four squares with no difference in the distance between the front, rear, left, and right. Using this planting method, half of the seeds and half of the fertilizer can be saved compared to general strip planting; because square-planted corn can be cultivated in both vertical and horizontal directions, greatly saving manpower for cultivating and weeding; most importantly, the distance between seedlings is increased, and crops can get full sunlight and moisture, greatly increasing the yield. This planting method is not only suitable for corn, but also for beets, cabbage, and sunflowers.

    There is a close-planting planter that can plant forty-eight rows at a time. The structure is very precise. Seeing this machine, people will definitely feel that it is cordial and lovely. In recent years, China has implemented close planting, and its benefits are well known.

    Next, the planter that fertilizes in the front and sows in the back and the seedling transplanter for vegetable gardens appear before our eyes. After the transplanter is started, the furrow opener below opens a ditch in the ground, and the hose connected to the water tank sends water to the ditch for irrigation. At this time, the seedling planting workers sit on the machine seat and hand the vegetable seedlings to the iron hand on the machine. The iron hand moves downward and plants the vegetable seedlings in the ground, and the covering soil device behind the machine follows and covers the soil. With this machine, dozens of acres of cabbage and tomatoes can be planted in one day, which is dozens of times more efficient than manual seedling planting.

    The famous "Stalin-6" and "Stalin-4" combine harvesters, the smart beet, potato, flax, and corn combine harvesters, and the cotton pickers that are surprising to see, can also be seen in the west square of the Soviet Exhibition Hall.

    The "Stalin-6" grain combine harvester is thirteen meters long and seven meters wide. It is not easy to even turn around if it is placed on a small plot of land of two or three mu. How small a person looks standing next to its tall machine body! It can cut 4.9 meters wide of wheat at a time, and four people working on the machine can cut three or four hundred mu of wheat in a day. It is equipped with electric lights on the front, back, left, and right, and even the night cannot stop people's harvesting work. This machine undertakes the work of harvesting, threshing, cleaning, and loading onto trucks. After the golden wheat is rolled into the machine's sickle, the wheat grains enter the granary one by one; at this time, the wheat husks are blown into the wheat husk bin by the machine's blower, and the wheat straw is piled on the ground from the rear of the machine. It is really like what the Soviet writer Ilyin said, it is "the most agile worker"!

    The following combine harvesters also arouse people's interest.

    When the beet combine harvester is harvesting, it extends its iron hand to the lower part of the beet to loosen the soil, and the iron claws above grab the beet seedlings and pull the beet up; the beet is lifted into the machine, the beet seedlings are cut off, and the beet is completely sent to the vegetable box. This machine can harvest three rows at a time, and a day's work can top one hundred and fifty people. After the iron shovel of the potato combine harvester shovels the potatoes out of the soil, it passes through the iron chain conveyor belt,甩掉了(throws off) the large soil blocks, and then squeezes through two rubber rollers, and the small soil blocks attached to the potatoes are also squeezed off; when the two belts at the rear of the machine separate the potatoes from their branches and leaves, the potatoes enter the storage place. Such a machine can excavate more than seventy mu of potatoes a day. The bottom of the flax combine harvester has seven sets of flax-pulling tools, each set with two belts. When the machine drives these belts to rotate backward, the two belts are close together, and the flax approaching it can be pulled up. When flax arrives in the machine, not only can the hemp seeds and hemp leaves be separated, but also the hemp stalks can be bundled one by one. The corn combine harvester can harvest two rows at a time. When the corn stalks arrive in the machine, the corn cobs and corn stalks are separated, the corn cobs are sent to the corn box by the chain belt, and the corn stalks are crushed and sent to the last cylinder.

    How exactly does the machine pick cotton? People will understand as soon as they come here to see. When the cotton picker is started, a row of cotton enters the started machine, and the spindles with small toothed cogs on the rollers at the rear of the machine rotate, and the cotton is picked off by the small teeth; when the spindles turn to the rear, the brush brushes the cotton off the small teeth, and the air extractor sucks the cotton into the cotton box. Occasionally, cotton that falls on the ground is sucked into another cotton bin by the air cylinder at the end of the machine. Unopened cotton bolls, which cannot be touched or squeezed, can be harvested again during the second picking. The work of each of these cotton pickers every day can抵六十个人 (equal sixty people).

    After people visit various combine harvesters, they will associate with the great creativity of the Soviet people. They have mechanized such complex and laborious production processes, which cannot but make people marvel.

    We saw many machines for harvesting pasture in the Soviet Exhibition Hall. These machines also mechanized the process of harvesting, cutting, and storing pasture. As everyone knows, in addition to agricultural production, each collective farm in the Soviet Union also raises herds of cattle and sheep, because livestock products are an indispensable part of the lives of the Soviet people. After seeing the machines for large-scale harvesting and processing of feed here, people will have a concept of the Soviet Union's animal husbandry.

    In the square, there are two other agricultural tools that will be of great interest to visitors. One is the horse-drawn reversible plow, which is suitable for mountainous areas. Its plowshare can be turned left and right so that the land plowed back and forth can be turned in one direction. This is exactly the agricultural tool that my country currently needs. The other is a pesticide sprayer pulled by a small tractor. It can spray medicine on a large planting area, which is ten times more efficient than manual sprayers. Seeing this sprayer, we thought of the insect pests that plagued the cotton-growing areas in the suburbs of Beijing this spring and summer when it rained continuously. At that time, the pests bit the cotton seedlings to death piece by piece. As long as the treatment could be done one day earlier, many cotton seedlings could be saved. However, many rural areas in the suburbs of Beijing lack even manual sprayers, let alone tractor-drawn sprayers. The Red Star Collective Farm, which planted 7,000 mu of cotton fields, tried its best to use manual spraying of pesticides, but it still could not keep up with the needs. At that time, if there could be dozens of such sprayers, what a different situation would appear in the large area of ​​cotton fields in the farm!

    社会主义农业的技术基础
    ——介绍苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会上的农业机器
    本报记者　于明
    苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会快开幕了。
    苏联展览馆的西广场上，陈列着打扮得十分鲜艳的各种拖拉机和农业机器；这些机器都是新近从苏联运来的，其中有很多的机器上面，都铸着一九五四年制造的字样。
    顺序在广场上走一遭，人们就会有一个总的印象：在苏联，从开垦荒地、耕、种、施肥、锄草，一直到收割、脱粒、处理饲料，都有机器代替人工了。
    广场上共陈列了几十部拖拉机和农业机器，这和上月在苏联开幕的苏联农业展览会中展览的八百部农业机器比较起来，还不到十分之一；可是，我们只从这几十部农业机器上，就能看出苏联农业生产的规模有多大，耕作有多么细致了。
    出重工业馆的西门，人们首先看到的，是全世界闻名的大力士——“斯大林八十号”拖拉机。这种拖拉机可拉两部五铧犁，可拉两部“斯大林六号”联合收割机。它牵引着犁耕地，在苏联一天可耕四百亩地，耕深还能达到九寸。垦荒中它一天能开垦一百八十亩地。它带动新式的挖树根和挖石块的机器，八个小时能挖出二百个树桩和残根，一次能从地里掘出两万斤重的石块，并把它拖走。一台这样的拖拉机，一天的工作量能顶数百人的工作。在这里还可以看到“得特五十四号”拖拉机、“白俄罗斯”拖拉机，都使用柴油，成本低，而牵引的效率却很高，是苏联普通使用的拖拉机。此外，有两个涂了鲜红颜色的小型胶皮轮的拖拉机，看起来十分灵巧、美丽，它们在果木和蔬菜生产中担任起重要的任务。
    和各种拖拉机并列的，是开垦荒地用的农业机器。这些机器上的犁铧、圆盘耙、草根切断机的切刀，庞大而坚实，看了真是使人吃惊。一部开荒用的二铧犁，可耕五十四公分宽，它能够在泥沼灌木地上裕如地进行耕作；草根切断机可耕二十五公分深，切刀一转动，就可把很坚硬的草根切断。拖拉机牵引的植树犁，可耕到五十公分宽、七十五公分深，能在犁刀经过的地方开出一条深沟；在苏联，这是大批栽种果木不可缺少的机器。我们看了这些能干的机器，就想到了苏联人民征服自然的力量是多么强大了，今年他们在五个月内开垦了一千多万公顷的荒地，就是这种强大力量的具体表现。
    在广场的北部和西部，可看到比人手都精巧、准确，而它的效率可抵数十以至数百只手的播种机和收割机。
    大家都知道，为提高农业生产，苏联正在广泛推行方形簇种法。人们在这里看到了实行这种种植法的机器。一部玉米方形点播机，一天能播种百余亩地，它能够把种子一窝一窝地播成四方形，前后左右的距离一点不差。用这种播种方法，能比一般条播节省一半种籽，节省一半肥料；因为方形种植的玉米，纵横都可进行中耕，大大节省了中耕锄草的人力；最重要的，就是苗和苗之间的距离扩大，庄稼能够得到充分的阳光和水分，使产量大大提高。这种种植法不但对玉米适用，对甜菜、白菜和向日葵等也都适用。
    有一种一次能播四十八行的密植播种机，构造十分精密，看到这种机器，人们一定会觉得它亲切可爱。我国近几年来实行了密植，它的好处是尽人皆知的。
    接着，前部施肥、后部下种的播种机和菜园用的栽苗机出现在我们的眼前了。栽苗机开动后，下面的开沟器在地上开了一条沟，和水箱连接的皮管把水送到沟里浇灌，这时，栽苗工人坐在机座上，把菜秧递给机器上的铁手里，铁手向下移动把菜秧栽到地里，机器后的覆土器跟着就把土覆上了。用这种机器，把数十亩地的白菜、西红柿一天就栽上了，比人工栽秧的效率提高了数十倍。
    著名的“斯大林六号”和“斯大林四号”联合收割机，灵巧的甜菜、马铃薯、亚麻、玉米联合收割机，和看了使人惊奇的摘棉机，人们在苏联展览馆的西广场上也都可以看到。
    “斯大林六号”谷物联合收割机的体长十三公尺，宽七公尺，把它放在两三亩地的小块土地上，简直连转身都不容易。一个人站在它的高大的机体旁边，显得多么小啊！它一次能割四点九公尺宽的小麦，四个人在机器上工作，一天能割三、四百亩地的小麦。它的前后左右都装设了电灯，即使黑夜也不能阻止人们的收获工作。这种机器把收割、脱粒、清选和装上卡车的工作都担负起来了，金黄色的小麦卷进机器的镰刀后，一会儿一颗颗的麦粒就进入谷仓里了；这时，麦壳被机器的吹风机吹到了麦壳箱里，麦秸则从机器的后部被一堆堆的丢到地上去了。它真像苏联作家伊林所说的，是“一个最敏捷的工人”！
    下面几种联合收割机，同样引起人们的兴趣。
    甜菜联合收割机在收割时，把自己的铁手伸到甜菜的下部一松土，上面的铁爪就抓住菜缨把甜菜拔起来了；甜菜被提到机器里，把菜缨切去，甜菜就完整地被送到菜箱里了。这种机器一次能收三行，一天的工作能顶上一百五十个人。马铃薯联合收割机的铁铲，把马铃薯从土里铲起来以后，经过铁链输送带，把大的土块甩掉了，又经过两个橡皮滚子的挤压，就把沾在马铃薯上的小土块也都挤掉了；等机器的后部两个皮带把马铃薯和它的枝叶分开，马铃薯就走进了储放的地方。这样的机器，一天能挖掘七十多亩地的马铃薯。亚麻联合收割机的低部，有七套拔亚麻的工具，每套上有两根皮带。机器带动这些皮带向后转动时，两根皮带靠紧，就可把走近它的亚麻拔起来了。亚麻到了机器里，不但可把麻籽、麻叶分开，而且会把麻秸一捆一捆的捆好。玉米联合收割机，一次能收两行，玉米秆到了机器里，玉米棒子和玉米秆就被割离了，玉米棒子被链带送到玉米箱里，而玉米秆则被切碎，送到最后的筒子里了。
    机器究竟怎样摘棉花的呢？人们只要到这里看一看就明白了。摘棉机开动时，一行棉花走进开动的机器里，机器后部的滚轴上有小齿的锭子转动起来，就由小齿把棉花采摘下来了；当锭子转到后面时，毛刷把棉花从小齿上刷了下来，抽风机就把棉花抽到棉箱里了。偶有掉在地上的棉花，则被机器最后的风筒吸收到另一个棉仓里去。没有裂开的棉桃，既碰不掉，也挤不坏，它们可以等第二次收摘时，再进行收摘。这种摘棉机，每部每天的工作能抵六十个人。
    人们参观了各种联合收割机以后，就会联想到苏联人民的伟大创造性。他们把这样复杂、费力的生产过程都机械化了，这不能不令人赞叹。
    我们在苏联展览馆看到了许多收割牧草的机器。这些机器使牧草收割、切制和储存的过程也都机械化了。大家都知道，苏联每个集体农庄除进行农业生产以外，还饲养着成群的牛羊，因为畜产品是苏联人民生活中不可缺少的部分。人们在这里看了大规模收割和处理饲料的机器，就会对苏联的养畜业得到一个概念。
    在广场上，还有另外两种农具会使参观者感到莫大的兴趣。一种是马拉翻转犁，适用于山地，它的犁铧可以左右翻转，使往返所耕的地，都朝着一个方向翻土。这正是我国目前农业需用的一种农具。另外一种是由小型拖拉机牵引的药剂喷射器。它能在很大的种植面积上喷药，比人工喷射器的效率高十倍。看到了这种喷射器，我们就想起了今年春夏连绵霪雨时，京郊棉区遭受虫害的情况。那时害虫把棉苗一片一片咬死，只要能早治一天，就能挽救很多棉苗。可是京郊许多农村连人工喷射器都缺少，更不用说拖拉机牵引的喷射器了。种了七千亩棉田的红星集体农庄，全力用人工喷射药剂，还是赶不上需要。那时如果能够有数十架这样的喷射器，农庄大块面积的棉田上该会出现如何不同的情况啊！
