During their visit to China, the Soviet athletics team imparted advanced Soviet athletics experience and techniques to Chinese athletes through demonstrations and coaching.

The Soviet athletics team members who visited China this time were mostly renowned Soviet athletics coaches and sports workers. Among them, Honored Master of Sports of the USSR, Sinitskaya, is an athletics teacher at the Kiev Institute of Physical Culture in the Soviet Union; Master of Sports Pyatekin is an athletics coach at the Moscow Central Sports Club of the Army; and Honored Master of Sports of the USSR, Gokieli, is an athletics coach at the Tbilisi Dynamo Sports Association. They all possess rich competition and coaching experience. In addition to giving demonstration performances and participating in two friendly matches at the 1954 Thirteen-City Athletics and Gymnastics Games for secondary and higher education students in China, the Soviet athletics team also gave four reports, participated in three symposiums, and conducted six demonstration training sessions for Chinese sports workers and athletes in Beijing, Shenyang, and Lushun-Dalian. The symposiums and demonstration training sessions were divided into ten groups, including high jump, short-distance running, javelin, women's hurdles, and hammer throw, to provide specialized guidance and training to Chinese athletes. The hammer throw is a sport that China had never had before, and the Soviet athletics team imparted the basic knowledge of hammer throw to Chinese athletes this time.

In their demonstration performances, coaching, and friendly competitions in various places, the Soviet athletics team fully demonstrated their sincere enthusiasm and unreserved help to Chinese athletes. Soviet Master of Sports Pyatekin helped Chinese athlete Li Qi correct his shortcomings immediately after running a 1,500-meter race in Lushun-Dalian. Soviet Master of Sports Ilyasov analyzed the four components of high jump, "approach," "take-off," "bar clearance," and "landing," from a theoretical perspective and demonstrated the movements to Chinese athletes. He jumped more than a hundred times in the three demonstration coaching sessions in Lushun-Dalian. His tireless, sincere, and selfless spirit deeply moved Chinese athletes. In the demonstration training, every movement was led by the Soviet athletes themselves, and they corrected the postures of Chinese athletes very patiently and meticulously. On the sports field in Beijing, Soviet Master of Sports Ilyasov demanded that athletes maintain correct postures during practice. He helped Chinese athletes correct their postures one by one. He encouraged Chinese athletes as soon as they made progress. Soviet athletes were very concerned about safety issues during training. When helping Chinese athletes with a complex auxiliary movement, Honored Master of Sports of the USSR, Popov, personally held each athlete and encouraged them to practice boldly. During the demonstration performances and coaching of Soviet athletes, Chinese athletes also learned very humbly and earnestly from Soviet athletes. They were full of energy during practice and accepted the guidance of Soviet athletes. Therefore, they learned a lot of advanced Soviet athletics experience and techniques.

With the help of Soviet athletes, Chinese athletes have made great progress. In the demonstration coaching in Beijing, Chen Xinggui, who won the third place in women's discus with a score of 31.05 meters in Lushun-Dalian, had improved her score to 34 meters, exceeding the current Lushun-Dalian women's discus champion's record of 33.275 meters. After breaking the national men's javelin record of the past 18 years in Lushun-Dalian, Yu Jin'an created a new record in Shenyang. On the sports field, when his javelin exceeded the small yellow flag marking the national record, Honored Master of Sports of the USSR, Andreeva, told him the correct method of drawing the javelin. After Yu Jin'an corrected his javelin drawing posture, he threw 57.28 meters. Li Qi, who won the men's 800-meter championship in Lushun-Dalian, had the original shortcomings of unnatural arm swing and uneven distribution of physical strength. He ran very fast in the first 200 meters and could not sprint with all his strength later. After correcting this shortcoming according to the guidance of Soviet Master of Sports and Athletics Coach of the Moscow Central Sports Club of the Army, Pyatekin, his score in Shenyang improved to 1 minute 58.2 seconds, exceeding the championship-winning score of 2 minutes 0.3 seconds.

    苏联田径队在访问我国期间
    向我国运动员传授苏联先进田径运动经验
    苏联田径队在访问我国期间通过示范表演和教练，向我国田径运动员传授了苏联先进田径运动的经验和技术。
    这次来我国访问的苏联田径队队员大部分是苏联著名的田径教练和体育工作者。其中苏联功勋运动员西尼茨卡娅是苏联基辅体育学院的田径教员，运动健将皮亚泰金是莫斯科苏军之家的田径教练，苏联功勋运动员戈基耶利是梯比里斯狄纳莫体育协会的田径教练。他们都具有丰富的竞赛和教练经验。苏联田径队这次除在我国参加一九五四年十三城市的中等以上学校学生田径、体操运动大会作示范表演和进行两次友谊比赛外，还在北京、沈阳、旅大三城市为我国体育工作者和运动员作了四次报告，参加了三次座谈会，并且作了六次示范训练。座谈和示范训练分作跳高、短距离跑、标枪、女子跨栏、链球等十个小组，对我国田径运动员进行专门指导和训练。其中链球运动是中国过去从来没有过的运动项目，苏联田径队这次为我国运动员传授了链球运动的基本知识。
    苏联田径队在各地示范表演、教练和友谊竞赛中，充分表现了对我国运动员诚恳热情和毫无保留的帮助。苏联运动健将皮亚泰金在旅大刚跑过一千五百公尺径赛就帮助我国运动员李琦矫正缺点。苏联运动健将伊利亚索夫把跳高的“助跑”、“起跳”、“过竿”、“落地”四个组成部分从理论上加以分析后，并向我国运动员作示范动作。在旅大的三次示范教练中他一共跳了一百多回。他的这种不辞劳苦真诚无私的精神使我国运动员极受感动。在示范训练中，每个动作都是由苏联运动家亲自带领来作，并且十分耐心地为我国运动员矫正姿势，一丝不苟。在北京的运动场上，苏联运动健将伊利亚索夫要求运动员在练习时一定要姿势正确。他就一个一个地帮助我国运动员纠正姿势。我国运动员稍有进步就受到他的鼓励。苏联运动家很关心训练中的安全问题，在帮助我国运动员作一个复杂的辅助动作时，苏联功勋运动员波波夫亲手扶着每个运动员，并鼓励他们大胆练习。在苏联运动员的示范表演和教练中，我国运动员也十分虚心认真地向苏联运动员学习，他们在练习时精神饱满，接受苏联运动员的指导。因此，他们学到了不少苏联先进的田径运动经验和技术。
    我国运动员在苏联运动员的帮助下获得了很大的进步。在北京的示范教练中，曾在旅大以三十一公尺零五公分获得女子铁饼第三名的陈兴桂的成绩已提高到三十四公尺，超过了日前旅大女子铁饼冠军的三十三公尺二十七点五公分的纪录。于金安在旅大打破十八年来男子标枪全国最高纪录后，又在沈阳创造新的纪录。在运动场上，当他的标枪超过了标志全国最高纪录的小黄旗时，苏联功勋运动员安德烈耶娃又告诉他引枪的正确方法，于金安改正引枪姿势后，一掷就是五十七公尺二十八公分。在旅大获男子八百公尺冠军的李琦原有臂部摆动不自然和体力分配不平衡的缺点，头二百米跑得很快，到后来不能全力冲刺。他按照苏联运动健将、莫斯科苏军之家田径教练皮亚泰金的指导改正这个缺点后，在沈阳的成绩提高到一分五十八秒二，超过了以二分零秒三获得冠军的成绩。　（新华社）
