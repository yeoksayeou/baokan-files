People's Masses are the Masters of our Country

Editor's Note: The founding of the People's Republic of China declared that the people of our country are the masters who exercise all state power. Over the past five years, through their own political struggle experiences and practical life experiences, the people have deeply realized that the People's Representative Conference and the People's Congress system are the best political systems for the people to manage their own country, and they have wholeheartedly promoted the development from the People's Representative Conference to the People's Congress. This development will further consolidate the people's position as masters of the country, further enhance the people's enthusiasm and creativity, and more effectively promote the smooth progress of the country's socialist industrialization and socialist transformation.

The Development and Consolidation of the People's Democratic Regime in the Past Five Years
Zhu Yuan

    The construction of the people's democratic regime has achieved great success in the five years since the founding of the People's Republic of China.

    In the early days of the liberation of mainland China in 1949, due to limitations in various aspects, the people's governments in some places invited people from all walks of life to hold forums, announce administrative guidelines and policies, solicit opinions from all walks of life on the government's work, and jointly discuss local affairs. In rural areas, the method of farmers' associations and farmers' representative conferences exercising administrative power on behalf of the government was adopted. After a short period of work, the revolutionary order became increasingly stable, the people were gradually organized through various revolutionary tasks, and a large number of activists emerged, forming the backbone of leadership among the masses. On this basis, people's representative conferences from all walks of life were convened in various places. Areas that were liberated earlier had already convened them before the founding of the People's Republic of China. By the end of 1950, the number of counties that had convened people's representative conferences from all walks of life reached 94 percent of the total number of counties in the country at that time. The generation of representatives also developed from government invitations to methods such as self-election by various sectors and government invitations. For example, among the 360 representatives of the first Tianjin People's Representative Conference from all walks of life, the representatives of various democratic parties, people's organizations, and agencies and troops were all self-elected or selected by their own units; representatives from the business community, farmers, literary and art circles, and other sectors were invited by the Tianjin Municipal People's Government. Through the People's Representative Conferences from all walks of life, the people have increasingly deeply realized their position as masters of the country. Li Baorong, a representative of the Taizhou People's Representative Conference in Jiangsu Province, participated in five conferences. He used his own experience to illustrate the process of his gradual improvement in his awareness as a master of the country: "The first time was to listen to the meeting, the second time I only said nice things, the third time I started to dare to criticize, the fourth time I spoke boldly, and the fifth time I spoke freely." The democratic form of the conference became increasingly complete, and the number of representatives gradually increased, making the representativeness of the conference gradually more extensive. The number of representatives from the working class increased year by year, showing the continuous growth of the working class and embodying the leadership of the working class in the people's democratic regime. At the same time, the representatives also included representatives from various ethnic minorities, various democratic classes, and people from all walks of life, fully embodying the spirit of the broad people's democratic united front. The direct and indirect elections of representatives gradually accounted for an absolute majority. By October 1951, in cities and counties that were liberated earlier, such as North China and Northeast China, the direct and indirect elections of representatives to the People's Representative Conference had increased to 80 to 90 percent, while specially invited and nominated representatives had decreased to 20 to 10 percent.

    During this period, the People's Representative Conferences from all walks of life in many places gradually exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress as conditions gradually matured. The fact that the People's Representative Conferences from all walks of life exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress marked an important development of our country's people's democratic system. Before the grassroots elections, all provinces and centrally administered municipalities, more than two-thirds of the cities, more than one-third of the counties, and more than four-fifths of the townships across the country had exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress.

    Our country is a large multi-ethnic country. In the People's Representative Conferences at all levels, ethnic minorities scattered throughout the country have their own appropriate number of representatives. Areas where ethnic minorities live in concentrated or mixed communities have implemented regional autonomy and established autonomous regional people's governments. By June 1952, 130 autonomous regional people's governments at all levels had been established nationwide. By May 1954, there were 58 autonomous regional people's governments above the county level nationwide.

    Over the past few years, the people have exercised the power to manage state affairs through the People's Representative Conferences at all levels. Various major political movements and social reform movements carried out by the People's Government over the years have been discussed and resolved by the People's Representative Conference. Because the People's Representative Conference has a broad mass base, once its resolutions are implemented, they immediately become the practical actions of the broad masses. The People's Representative Conference has reviewed and discussed the work summaries and work plans of the People's Government in each period, and put forward opinions, criticisms and suggestions. The proposals submitted by the people to the People's Representative Conference reflect the various political, economic, and cultural demands of the people from all walks of life, and reflect the people's opinions on the work and staff of the government. Over the past few years, the People's Representative Conferences in various places have generally made serious efforts to collect proposals and seriously handle them. The People's Representative Conference explained and clarified the proposals that were difficult to implement for the time being to the representatives; those that could be resolved were handled in order of importance and urgency after the meeting. In many places, all proposals were compiled into a booklet at the next meeting, with the original proposer noted at the end of the case, and distributed to representatives and units, so that representatives and the masses could understand the handling of the proposals. Because the People's Representative Conference can be responsible for handling proposals, the people's sense of being the masters of the country has been rapidly strengthened. The strict supervision of the government's work and cadres by the People's Representative Conference has played a great role in overcoming bureaucracy and other undesirable work styles.

    The representatives of the People's Representative Conference are outstanding members of the people and representative figures. During the sessions of the People's Representative Conference, they represent the people in exercising the power to manage state affairs. During the adjournment, they widely contact the masses in their daily lives, help the masses solve various difficulties, or promptly reflect the demands raised by the masses to the government or relevant departments for resolution. The representatives are firm executors of the resolutions of the People's Representative Conference. They convey the resolutions of the conference to the masses and take the lead in implementing the resolutions. Lively examples of representatives wholeheartedly serving the people can be found everywhere.

    In recent years, due to the completion of land reform across the country, the stability of the revolutionary order, the widespread organization of the people, and the accumulation of rich experience in exercising democratic rights, the conditions for implementing the system of people's congresses through universal suffrage have been fully met. In the spring of 1953, after the promulgation of the Electoral Law, grassroots people's congresses were directly elected by universal suffrage in various parts of the country, and on this basis, representatives of the people's congresses of counties, cities, provinces, and the National People's Congress were elected. The implementation of the system of people's congresses through universal suffrage has brought the construction of the people's democratic regime into a new stage. A total of 214,798 units across the country conducted grassroots elections, with a total of 323,809,684 registered voters nationwide, and 278,093,100 people participated in the voting, accounting for 85.88 percent of the total number of voters. Female voters accounted for 84.01 percent of the total number of female voters. In the grassroots elections, a total of 5,669,144 representatives to the grassroots people's congresses were elected across the country. Many of them are Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, outstanding members of the working class, activists in socialist construction and transformation, as well as representatives from government agencies, the military, cultural and educational circles, religious circles, street residents, and other aspects.

    After the convening of the people's congresses at the local levels, the National People's Congress is about to open. The people of our country will exercise their supreme power through the National People's Congress, discuss and adopt the Constitution and other laws, review the work of the government over the past few years and decide on the major policies and guidelines of the country, and formally elect the Chairman of the People's Republic of China, the State Council, and other state organs. All of these mark a further democratization of our country's politics. Further political democratization heralds an even greater surge in the political enthusiasm, patriotic enthusiasm, and production enthusiasm of the people of our country, and it also heralds a stronger and more effective unified leadership of the central government. The great cause of socialist industrialization and socialist transformation will therefore be more powerfully guaranteed.

专栏：人民群众是我们国家的主人

    编者按：中华人民共和国的成立，宣布了我国人民是行使国家一切权力的主人。五年来，人民群众通过自己的政治斗争经验和实际生活经验，已经深切地体会到人民代表会议和人民代表大会制度是人民管理自己国家的最好的政治制度，并全力促进由人民代表会议到人民代表大会的发展。这一发展，将更加巩固人民在国家中的主人翁地位，更加发挥人民群众的积极性和创造性，更加有力地促进国家的社会主义工业化和社会主义改造事业的顺利进展。
    五年来人民民主政权的发展和巩固
    朱元
    中华人民共和国成立五年来，人民民主政权建设工作获得了很大的成就。
    一九四九年我国大陆解放的初期，由于各方面条件的限制，有些地方的人民政府曾邀请社会各界人士举行座谈会，宣布施政方针和各项政策，征询各界人士对政府工作的意见，共同商量地方大事。农村中则采取由农民协会、农民代表会行使行政权力的代行办法。以后经过一个短时期的工作，革命秩序日趋稳定，人民群众也通过各项革命工作逐渐组织起来，并且涌现出大批积极分子，形成了群众中的领导骨干。在这种基础上，各地先后召开了各界人民代表会议。解放较早的地区，在中华人民共和国成立之前即已召开。到一九五零年底，召开了各界人民代表会议的县当时已达全国总县数的百分之九十四。代表的产生，也由政府邀请，发展到由各界自行推选和政府邀请等方法。如天津市首届各界人民代表会议三百六十名代表中，各民主党派、人民团体和机关、部队的代表，都是由本单位自行推选或选派；工商界、农民、文艺界等各界人士代表，则由天津市人民政府聘请。经过各界人民代表会议，人民日益深刻地认识了自己的主人翁地位。江苏省泰州市人民代表会议代表李宝荣参加过五次会议，他用自己的体验说明了自己主人翁觉悟逐步提高的过程：“第一次是听会，第二次只说好听话，第三次开始敢批评，第四次大胆说话，第五次就畅所欲言了。”会议的民主形式日益完备，代表的名额逐渐增多，使会议的代表性逐渐更加广泛。代表中工人阶级的代表逐年增加，显示了工人阶级的不断壮大，体现了人民民主政权中工人阶级的领导。同时，代表中又包括了各少数民族、各民主阶级和各界人民的代表人物，充分体现了广泛的人民民主统一战线的精神。代表的产生，直接和间接选举的逐渐占了绝对多数。到一九五一年十月，华北、东北等解放较早的市、县，人民代表会议代表中，直接和间接选举的已增加到百分之八十至九十，特邀和推派的代表则减少到百分之二十至百分之十。
    在这期间，许多地方的各界人民代表会议由于条件逐渐成熟，逐步代行了人民代表大会的职权。各界人民代表会议代行人民代表大会职权的事实，标志着我国人民民主制度的重要发展。基层选举以前，全国所有的省、中央直辖市，三分之二以上的市，三分之一以上的县和五分之四以上的乡，都已代行了人民代表大会的职权。
    我国是一个多民族的大国。在各级人民代表会议中，散居各地的少数民族都有自己适当名额的代表。少数民族聚居或杂居的地区，则实行了区域自治，建立了自治区人民政府。到一九五二年六月，全国已建立各级自治区人民政府一百三十个。到一九五四年五月，全国县级以上的自治区人民政府已有五十八个。
    几年来，人民通过各级人民代表会议行使了管理国家事务的权力。历年来人民政府所进行的各种重大政治运动和社会改革运动，都经过人民代表会议进行讨论，并作出决议。由于人民代表会议有着广泛的群众基础，它的各项决议一经贯彻，立即成为广大群众的实际行动。人民政府每一时期的工作总结和工作计划，人民代表会议都做了审查和讨论，提出意见，提出批评和建议。人民群众提交人民代表会议的提案，反映着各阶层人民在政治上、经济上、文化上的各种要求，反映着人民对政府工作和工作人员的各种意见。几年来，各地人民代表会议一般都作到认真搜集提案和严肃处理提案。人民代表会议对于人民提案中一时难于实现的，向代表作了解释说明；能够解决的，就在会后分别轻重缓急依次办理。很多地方更在下次会议时把所有提案汇印成册，案尾注明原提案人，分发给代表和单位，使代表和群众了解提案处理情况。由于人民代表会议能够负责处理提案，人民群众的国家主人翁感觉迅速加强了。人民代表会议对政府工作和干部所进行的严格监督，对于克服官僚主义和其他不良作风发生了很大作用。
    人民代表会议的代表，是人民群众中的优秀分子和有代表性的人物。在人民代表会议开会期间，他们代表人民行使管理国家事务的权力，在闭会期间，则在日常生活中广泛联系群众，帮助群众解决各种困难，或把群众提出的要求及时反映给政府或有关部门加以解决。代表们是人民代表会议决议的坚决执行者，他们向群众传达会议决议，并带头执行决议。人民代表热心为人民服务的生动事例，到处都可以找到。
    几年来，由于全国土地改革完成，革命秩序安定，人民群众已经普遍组织起来，并且积累了丰富的行使民主权利的经验，所以实行普选的人民代表大会制度的条件已经完全成熟。一九五三年春天，选举法公布后，全国各地先后用普选的方法直接选出基层人民代表大会，并且在这一基础上选举了县、市、省的人民代表大会和全国人民代表大会的代表。普选的人民代表大会制度的实行，使人民民主政权的建设工作进入更新的阶段。全国进行基层选举的单位共二十一万四千七百九十八个，全国登记选民总数三亿二千三百八十万九千六百八十四人，参加投票的达到二亿七千八百零九万三千一百人，占选民总数的百分之八十五点八八。女选民参加投票的占女选民总数百分之八十四点零一。在基层选举中，全国共选出基层人民代表大会代表五百六十六万九千一百四十四人。其中有许多是共产党员、青年团员、工人阶级中的优秀分子、社会主义建设和改造事业中的积极分子以及机关干部、军队、文化教育界、宗教界、街道居民和其他各个方面的代表。
    在地方各级人民代表大会会议召开之后，全国人民代表大会即将开幕，我国人民将通过全国人民代表大会行使自己的最高权力，讨论通过宪法和其他法律，审查政府几年来的工作并决定国家大政方针，正式产生中华人民共和国主席、国务院和其他国家机关。所有这些，都标志着我国政治的更进一步的民主化。政治的更进一步民主化，预示着我国人民政治积极性和爱国热情、生产热情的更加高涨，也预示着中央的统一领导的更加坚强有力。伟大的社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的事业，将因此获得更有力的保证。
