Xinhua News Agency, Paris, September 22nd: TASS reports: On September 20th, the French progressive public celebrated the eighty-fifth birthday of Marcel Cachin, one of the founders of the French Communist Party and a long-tested leader of the international revolutionary movement.

On September 20th, a celebration was held to congratulate Marcel Cachin on his birthday. Representatives from the French General Confederation of Labor, the French Women's Union, the French Republican Youth Union, the French Young Women's Union, the National Peace Council, and other progressive organizations extended their congratulations. François Billoux, Secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, delivered a congratulatory speech at the meeting.

Billoux said: Marcel Cachin has been dedicated to the revolutionary movement for sixty-three years. In 1920, he was the leader of the majority faction of the former French Socialist Party that decided to reorganize the French Socialist Party into the Communist Party. After the great October Socialist Revolution, Marcel Cachin made tireless efforts to establish and consolidate friendly relations between France and the Soviet Union. Currently, as a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party and the director of "l'Humanité," Cachin is actively fighting for the interests of the working class and the French people, for national independence, against the rearmament of Bonn revanchists, and for peace in Europe and the world.

Cachin expressed his gratitude for the honors and care he received, and he called on those present to redouble their efforts to fight against capitalism and colonial oppression, and for peace and the national independence of the motherland.
