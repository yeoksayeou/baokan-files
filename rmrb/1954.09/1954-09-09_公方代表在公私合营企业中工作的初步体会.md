Preliminary Experiences of Public Representatives Working in Joint Public-Private Enterprises
Li Ge, Director of Shanghai Joint Public-Private Zhengtai Rubber Factory

    After the Zhengtai Rubber Factory underwent the intermediate form of state capitalism through processing and ordering, it implemented joint public-private ownership in February of this year. At that time, I was appointed as the public representative of the company. A large number of problems were placed before me, the most prominent of which was the serious rate of defective products, with monthly losses due to defective products reaching over 700 million yuan. At that time, workers were in high spirits due to the change in the nature of the enterprise. On the one hand, they expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the corruption of the original enterprise, and on the other hand, they had high expectations for the leadership of the new enterprise, hoping to solve the existing problems in a timely manner.

  I. Relying on and Educating All Employees, Starting with Improving Quality to Transform the Enterprise
    I am a state cadre, and within this enterprise, I am a public representative. My responsibility is to carry out the socialist transformation of this enterprise according to the policies of the state. But to achieve this, I must first closely integrate with the Party and trade union organizations within the enterprise, wholeheartedly rely on the masses of employees, and conduct extensive and in-depth education among employees with socialist ideas to raise the class consciousness of employees, establish a sense of "being masters of their own house," and fully mobilize the masses of employees.
    To this end, we started with the current production problem of emphasizing quantity over quality, resulting in a serious rate of defective products. Under the unified leadership of the Party, through the trade union organization, a general meeting of employee representatives from the entire company was held. On the one hand, it pointed out the achievements of Zhengtai Rubber Company's transformation over the past few years, and on the other hand, it exposed the corrupt aspects of its capitalist enterprise. For example, in order to obtain high profits, regardless of the losses to the state and the people, when processing and manufacturing lifebuoys for the People's Liberation Army, they repeatedly cut corners, causing the People's Liberation Army to suffer some unnecessary losses. In the processing and manufacture of military shoes, "Sunday shoes" (shoes that would break after wearing them for a week) were found, hindering the army's actions. Other products, such as automobile tires, rickshaw tires, and shoes, suffered from poor quality, wasting raw materials purchased by the state with foreign exchange. In 1953 alone, losses from defective products amounted to more than 2.4 billion yuan. All this directly hindered the country's economic construction and, in fact, also affected the interests of the workers. At the same time, a comparison was made between capitalist enterprise management and socialist enterprise management, so that everyone could draw a clear line between capitalist and socialist management policies from the perspective of quality issues, thereby inducing employees to recognize the economistic tendencies that had arisen in the past due to the influence of capitalism and overcome the mistakes of only emphasizing welfare and not production, producing only for speed, pursuing bonuses, and "no one caring" about the quality of production.
    After the employees' awareness was raised, they made clear that they were the masters of the new enterprise, and recognized the corrupt side of the original enterprise, they were further educated to transform the original enterprise under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government. Therefore, they were guided to actively discover problems from production, find reasons, and think of solutions in order to first solve the serious defectiveness of the products. In group discussions, employees put forward 304 rationalization proposals, all of which were related to improving quality issues. Workers reflected, "Before the joint venture, the gentlemen in the writing room made many methods, asking us to do whatever they wanted us to do. If defective products came out, no one cared. They never discussed it with us. After the joint venture, all production issues were discussed and studied through the workers, and the opinions were quickly answered. We really became the masters of the enterprise."
    Since the joint venture, all employees have generally paid attention to the quality of products. The weekly group production meeting has never been interrupted. Some factories even held emergency production meetings to study and solve prominent defective product problems as soon as they were discovered. In the finished shoe workshop of Factory No. 1 (Zhengtai Rubber Factory has a total of six factories), in order to ensure quality and avoid hair falling on the shoe surface, it was stipulated that no one, regardless of who they were, could enter the workshop without wearing a hat. Shen Fuchang, a worker in the rolling workshop of Factory No. 1, used to roll ten cars of material as eleven cars, and sometimes secretly added a little oil, violating operating procedures, in order to save time and effort. After the employee representative meeting, knowing that production was now for the needs of the country and the people, he has not rolled a single car of material badly. Recently, he was rated as an excellent worker, and the same is generally true in other factories. Therefore, the monthly defect rate of each factory in the company has been greatly reduced compared to before the joint venture. If the defect rate of one month before the joint venture is taken as 100, then it has been reduced by 65.51% in June. From February to June, a total of more than 740 million yuan was saved due to the reduction of defective products (calculated based on the standard of January before the joint venture). After the joint venture, the financial work also saw a new situation of turning arrears into savings that had not been seen for many years. During the private operation, loans were frequently taken from the People's Bank of China. Since the joint venture, in addition to repaying the debts incurred during the private operation, paying the income tax that should have been paid during the private operation, paying for basic construction, and purchasing public bonds, there was also a surplus of 10.2 billion yuan.

  II. Educating and Improving Technical Personnel to Combine Technology with Labor
    While closely relying on the masses of employees to transform the old enterprise, we must attach importance to the education of technical personnel, especially senior technical personnel. In the early stage of the joint venture, some technical personnel were deeply influenced by capitalist ideology in the past and had a purely technical point of view, or had negative emotions such as "the more you do, the more mistakes you make; the less you do, the fewer mistakes you make; and the best is to do nothing." To this end, a special symposium of technical personnel from the entire company was held to explain the importance of the position of technical personnel in production, and to encourage them to actively study politics, gradually liberate themselves from the influence of capitalist ideology, and work with the workers to contribute their due strength to improving quality and transforming the enterprise. At the employee representative meeting, the worker comrades actively demanded to improve the technical level and improve the technical conditions, which greatly excited the technical personnel. Engineer You Qiwen, who had never interacted with workers and stayed in the "palace" (workers called the physical and chemical laboratory the "palace"), often went to the workshop to study technical issues with the workers after the joint venture. Workers and technicians established normal feelings from production. Because carbon black (rubber raw material) was difficult to import, the physical and chemical laboratory worked hard to research and use domestic carbon black to adjust the formula, and it approached the specifications required for tires. If all tires use domestic carbon black, 5.46 billion yuan in foreign exchange can be saved in one year.

  III. Uniting and Transforming Private Representatives
    Generally speaking, the public-private relationship after the joint venture of Zhengtai Rubber Factory is normal. Under the leadership of the public side, in administrative positions, the private representatives have positions and powers, abide by their duties and fulfill their responsibilities, and fully play the active role of the private representatives. In order to overcome the phenomenon of no one being responsible in the enterprise, I put forward a plan for the job arrangement of cadres in each factory. After fully consulting with the private representatives and reaching a consensus, it was announced. When the trade union held an employee representative meeting, because the private representatives could not participate, I suggested that the trade union invite the private representatives to attend and speak at the meeting in the name of enterprise administrative cadres, so that they also received a profound political education from the working class. One private representative said: "In the past, we thought that some defective products in the rubber industry were historical problems that were not easy to solve. After the worker comrades gave play to their collective wisdom, found the reasons, and thought of solutions, they have finally been solved." The moving examples of the vast number of employees actively producing and caring about quality under the encouragement of the idea of being masters of their own house have also been of great education to the private side. After the joint venture, the private representatives and their agents have been able to work actively, often taking the initiative to go to various factories to understand the situation and take responsibility for doing a good job in production. In particular, before and after the construction of the new carbon black factory, Yang Shaozhen, the third deputy manager (private representative), often worked in the workshop until late at night for the machine installation project. In the process of work and in dealing with certain problems, the opinions of the two sides are not always completely consistent, but because both sides can be open and honest and put forward different views for research, they can gradually tend to be consistent. For example, during the inventory and assessment of shares, some private shareholders often adopted an attitude of distrust and confrontation towards the correct policies of the state in order to safeguard their personal interests, but the results of the inventory and assessment proved that this attitude was incorrect; as the director of the inventory and assessment committee, the third deputy manager, and the private representative said at the end of the meeting: "Before the event, the private shareholders had many concerns, but after the discussion unfolded, everyone asked about what they didn't understand, clarified their opinions, and finally received a realistic, fair and reasonable result, which gave everyone an extremely profound education."

    Since the joint public-private ownership of Zhengtai Rubber Factory, under the correct leadership of the Party and the competent bureau at a higher level, and with the active efforts of all employees, although certain achievements have been made, there are still many problems, and it is still far from the requirements of socialist transformation. For example, the organizational structure of the entire enterprise has not been moved so far, and no necessary adjustments have been made to adapt to the changes in the nature of the enterprise and the needs of production development, so there is no organizational guarantee for the implementation of planned management and the achievement of comprehensive and balanced production. In order to further transform the enterprise, in the future, we should more closely rely on the masses of employees on the basis of the original work, continue to improve technical personnel and do a good job in uniting and transforming the private side, so as to gradually complete the tasks of the public representatives in the joint venture enterprise.

    公方代表在公私合营企业中工作的初步体会
    上海公私合营正泰橡胶厂厂长　李革
    正泰橡胶厂在经过加工订货的国家资本主义中级形式以后，于今年二月间实行公私合营，就在这时候，我被委派为该公司的公方代表。当时摆在我面前的是一大堆问题，而其中最突出的问题是产品副次率严重，一个月因副次品的损失最高达七亿元以上。当时工人们因企业的性质改变了，情绪高涨，一面对原企业的腐朽表示极端不满，另一面对新企业的领导则要求很高，希望及时解决存在的问题。
  一、依靠与教育全厂职工，从提高质量入手，进行企业改造
    我是国家干部，在这个企业内，是公方代表，我的职责是根据国家的政策，对这个企业进行社会主义改造。但要做到这一点，首先必须和企业内党和工会组织密切结合，全心全意依靠职工群众，并以社会主义的思想向职工进行广泛、深入的教育，提高职工的阶级觉悟，树立“当家做主”思想，把职工群众充分发动起来。
    为此，便从当前生产中只重数量、不重质量，副次率严重的问题入手。在党的统一领导下，通过工会组织，召开了一次全公司的职工代表会议，一面指出正泰橡胶公司几年来改造的成就，一面揭露了它的资本主义企业的腐朽的方面，例如为了获取高额利润，不顾国家人民的损失，为人民解放军加工制造救生圈时，曾历次偷工减料，使解放军遭受到某些不应有的损失；在加工制造军鞋时曾发现“礼拜鞋”（穿上一个星期就坏了），妨碍了军队的行动。其他如汽车轮胎、人力车胎及鞋子等，因不重视质量，耗用国家用外汇购来的原料，一九五三年仅副次品损失即达二十四亿元以上。这一切直接妨碍了国家的经济建设，实际上也影响了工人的利益。同时拿资本主义的企业经营和社会主义企业经营作对比，使大家从质量问题上划清资本主义与社会主义经营方针的界限，从而诱导职工认识过去因受资本主义影响而产生的经济主义倾向，克服只重福利而不重生产，生产只图抢快，追求奖金，质量好坏“死人不管”等错误。
    在职工觉悟提高，明确了自己是新企业的主人，认清原企业的腐朽一面以后，便进一步教育职工，在党和人民政府领导下，一定要把原企业改造好。于是，引导大家主动积极地从生产中发现问题，找原因，想办法，以求首先解决产品的严重副次现象。在小组讨论中，职工们提出了三百零四件合理化建议，全部属于有关改进质量问题。工人纷纷反映“合营前，先生们在写字间定了许多办法，要我们怎样做便怎样做，出了副次品谁也不管，从来也不同我们商量商量，合营后有关生产问题，件件都通过工人研究讨论，提了意见很快便答复，真是当了企业的主人。”
    合营以来，全体职工对产品的质量都普遍重视，每周一次小组生产会议从未间断，有的厂还做到一发现突出的副次品问题即临时召开紧急生产会议研究解决。一厂（正泰橡胶厂共有六个厂）的成鞋车间为了保证质量，避免头发丝落到鞋面上，规定车间门口不管任何人，不戴帽子便不得进去。一厂轧炼车间工人沈福昌，过去为图快省力，十车料常当十一车轧，有时还偷偷加上一点油，违犯操作规程。经过职工代表会议后，知道现在生产是为了国家和人民的需要以后，至今没有轧坏一车料，最近被评为优等工作者，其他各厂也普遍如此。因此全公司各厂每月副次率较合营前大为减少，如按合营前一月的副次率为一百，则六月份已降低百分之六十五点五一。自二月到六月，因降低副次品共计减少损失七亿四千多万元（以合营前一月份为标准计算）。合营后，财务工作上也出现了多年未有的反欠为存的新局面，私营期间经常向人民银行贷款，合营以来五个月除还清私营期间借欠，缴纳私营期间应缴所得税，支付基本建设，购买公债外，还盈余达一百零二亿元。
    二、教育、提高技术人员，使“技术与劳动相结合”
    在紧紧依靠职工群众来改造旧企业的同时，必须重视对技术人员尤其是高级技术人员的教育工作。合营初期，有一些技术人员因过去受资本主义的思想影响较深，存在着单纯的技术观点，或者
  “多做多错，少做少错，不做不错”等消极情绪。为此，曾专门召开过全公司技术人员座谈会，说明技术人员在生产中所处地位的重要性，启发他们积极学习政治，逐步从资本主义思想影响中解放出来，与工人群众一道，以技术支援生产，为提高质量，改造企业贡献自己应有的力量。在职工代表会议中，工人同志积极要求提高技术水平、改善技术条件，使技术人员大为振奋，一向不与工人来往、钻在“皇宫”（工人称理化实验室为“皇宫”）里的尤启文工程师，合营后经常到车间里与工人同志研究技术问题。工人和技术人员从生产中建立了正常的感情。因碳黑（橡胶原料）进口困难，理化实验室曾努力研究，采用国产碳黑调整配方，并接近轮胎所需规格。如全部轮胎采用国产碳黑，一年可节省外汇五十四亿六千万元。
    三、对私方代表的团结改造
      一般说来，正泰橡胶厂合营后的公私关系是正常的。在公方领导之下，在行政职务上，使私方代表有职有权、守职尽责，充分地发挥了私方代表的积极作用。为克服企业中无人负责的现象，我提出各厂干部的职位安排方案，经过与私方代表充分协商，取得一致意见后，再行宣布。工会召开职工代表会议时，因私方代表不能参加，我就建议工会以企业行政干部名义邀请私方代表列席并在会议上发言，使他们也接受了工人阶级一次深刻的政治教育。有一位私方代表说：“以前我们认为橡胶工业有些副次品是带历史性的不易解决的问题，经工人同志发挥了集体智慧，找原因，想办法，现在终于解决了。”广大职工在当家作主思想鼓舞下，积极生产，关心质量的动人事例，对私方也有极大教育。合营后，私方代表及其代理人皆能积极工作，经常主动地到各厂了解情况，负起搞好生产的责任。特别是新建碳黑厂前后，第三副经理（私方代表）杨少振经常为了机器安装工程，亲自在车间工作一直到深夜。在工作过程中和处理某些问题时，双方的意见并不是常常完全一致的，但由于双方都能开诚相见，将不同看法提出研究，也能逐渐趋于一致。如清产定股时，有些私股股东往往为了维护个人利益，对国家的正确政策时常采取不信任和对抗的态度，但清估的结果，事实证明，这种态度是不正确的；正如清估委员会主任、第三副经理、私方代表在会议结束时所说：“事前私股顾虑多端，及至展开讨论之后，大家不懂的问明白了，有意见的说清楚了，最后收到实事求是、公平合理的结果，使大家得到极其深刻的教育。”
    正泰橡胶厂公私合营以来，在上级党和主管局的正确领导下，在全体职工的积极努力之下，虽然取得一定成绩，但存在的问题还很多，距离社会主义改造的要求还很远。譬如整个企业的组织机构至今仍原封未动，还没有按企业性质的改变和生产发展的需要相适应地进行必要的调整，因而要实施计划管理，做到全面的均衡的生产，还没有组织保证。为进一步改造企业，今后应该在原有的工作基础上更紧密地依靠职工群众，继续提高技术人员和做好团结改造私方的工作，才能逐步地完成公方代表在合营企业中的任务。
