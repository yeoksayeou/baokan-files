Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 20th. "Pravda's" New York correspondent, Filippov, wrote a dispatch regarding the upcoming Ninth UN General Assembly.

He reported: Final preparations are now underway for the opening of the Ninth UN General Assembly on September 21st.

The focus of attention is a question that UN figures have always discussed on the eve of the UN General Assembly in recent years. This question is the issue of the People's Republic of China participating in the activities of the United Nations. After the Geneva Conference, this issue has become particularly pressing. During the Geneva Conference, the People's Republic of China appeared on the international stage, achieving the position it deserves among the great powers.

There is a general view among the delegations of various countries that now is the time to eliminate the abnormal situation that is extremely harmful to the prestige of the United Nations. It is generally believed here that the only obstacle to restoring the legitimate rights of the Chinese people in the United Nations is the absurd obstructionist policy of the United States.

Filippov said: One of the most important issues that the Ninth UN General Assembly must discuss is the report of the Disarmament Commission. As everyone knows, the deadlock created by American diplomacy in this committee a long time ago has not yet been broken.

However, all possibilities for reaching an agreement on this issue have not yet been fully explored. The Soviet Union's proposals aimed at reaching an agreement, as well as the proposals put forward by France and Britain to the Disarmament Commission's sub-committee on June 11, are still awaiting further consideration.

Filippov continued: The issue of admitting new member states will once again be raised at the Ninth UN General Assembly. As everyone knows, fourteen countries have been denied entry to the United Nations for many years because the American delegation – which controls the voting rights of countries dependent on the United States – still refuses to make the slightest change to its position, which is to cling to the principle of arbitrarily selecting new member states.

The public of all countries expects the Ninth UN General Assembly to finally open the doors of the United Nations and admit all countries that have applied without any discrimination.

The current General Assembly will have to deal with a number of organizational issues of great political significance, such as the election of three non-permanent members of the Security Council, the election of six members of the Economic and Social Council, and others.

It must also be pointed out that the preliminary agenda of the current General Assembly lists the report of the "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea" and report of the "United Nations Korean Reconstruction Agency" under the item of "Korean Question".

Issues related to the struggle of colonies and dependent countries for rights and national independence will occupy an important place at the current General Assembly.

The Ninth General Assembly will have to pay considerable attention to economic and social issues. Before the General Assembly are the periodic reports of the Economic and Social Council, the issue of economic development in backward countries, technical assistance programs, draft international covenants on human rights, and other social and economic activities of the United Nations.

Filippov concluded: The current UN General Assembly will open in an international situation that is very different from that of the previous General Assembly. Recently, thanks to the efforts of peace-loving countries, there has been a certain degree of easing of international tensions.

However, the facts show that the enemies of peace have not abandoned their sinister plans. Those American founders of the "Cold War" and "position of strength" policies are doing everything possible to obstruct the nascent international cooperation, aggravate international tensions, and are planning new plans aimed at preparing for and launching a Third World War.

The broad masses of people in all countries of the world expect the United Nations to fulfill its responsibilities to the peoples of all countries who long for lasting peace, and to contribute to strengthening peace and international security.

### “真理报”记者评论第九届联合国大会

    “真理报”记者评论第九届联合国大会
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十日讯：“真理报”驻纽约记者费利波夫写了一篇关于即将召开的第九届联合国大会的通讯。
    他报道说：现在正在为九月二十一日第九届联合国大会的开幕进行最后一分钟的准备工作。
    人们注意的中心，是近年来每当联合国大会开会前夕联合国人士总是谈起的一个问题。这个问题就是中华人民共和国参加联合国的活动的问题。在日内瓦会议以后，这个问题变得特别迫切起来了，在日内瓦会议期间，中华人民共和国出现在国际舞台上，取得了它在大国中应有的地位。
    各国代表团之间，普遍有这样的看法：现在是消除对联合国的威望十分有害的不正常状况的时候了。这里普遍认为，对于恢复中国人民在联合国内的合法权利的唯一障碍，就是美国的荒谬的阻挠政策。
    费利波夫说：第九届联合国大会必须讨论的最重要问题之一是裁军委员会的报告。大家知道，美国外交很久以前在这个委员会中所造成的僵局还没有打破。
    不过，在这个问题上，达成协议的一切可能性还远没有探寻净尽。苏联的目的在于达成协议的建议，以及法国和英国在六月十一日向裁军委员会小组委员会提出的建议，都有待进一步考虑。
    费利波夫接着说：接纳新会员国问题将再次在第九届联合国大会上提出。大家知道，十四个国家好些年来一直被拒于联合国之外，因为美国代表团——它控制着依附美国的各国的投票权——仍然拒绝对它的立场作丝毫的改变，这个立场就是死抱住专横地挑选新会员国的原则不放。
    各国公众期望第九届联合国大会终于打开联合国的大门，不加任何歧视地接纳已经提出申请的一切国家。
    本届大会将必须处理一些具有巨大政治意义的组织上的问题，如选举安全理事会的三个非常任理事国，选举经济及社会理事会的六个理事国，以及其他。
    还必须指出，本届大会初步议程在“朝鲜问题”这一项目下面列入了“联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会”的报告和“联合国朝鲜重建局”的报告。
    同殖民地及附属国争取权利和民族独立的斗争有关的问题，将在本届大会上占重要的地位。
    第九届大会将必须对经济及社会问题予以相当大的注意。摆在大会面前的有经济及社会理事会的定期报告，落后国家经济发展的问题，技术援助计划，国际人权公约草案，以及联合国其他社会的和经济的活动。
    费利波夫最后说：本届联合国大会将在同上届大会有很大不同的国际局势中开幕。最近，由于爱好和平的国家的努力，已经使国际紧张局势有了一定程度的缓和。
    但是，事实表明，和平的敌人并没有放弃他们的罪恶计划。那些“冷战”和“实力地位”政策的美国创始人，正在千方百计地阻挠在萌芽中的国际合作，使国际紧张局势恶化，并且在策划目的在于准备和发动第三次世界大战的新计划。
    世界各国的广大群众都期望联合国履行它对于渴望持久和平的各国人民所负的责任，并对加强和平和国际安全作出贡献。
