Xinhua News Agency, 1st Dispatch. TASS Berlin Dispatch: According to a report by the German News Agency, Fritz Leo Joho and Jupp Angenfort, Secretaries of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, were arrested by the West German authorities on August 27th.
Xinhua News Agency, 1st Dispatch. TASS Berlin, August 31st Dispatch: The German News Agency reported that the central organ of the German Communist Party, "Free People's Daily," published an interview by the Chairman of the German Communist Party, Max Reimann, with a reporter from the newspaper.
In response to the newspaper reporter's question as to why West Germany had recently intensified its persecution of German patriots and arrested leaders of the German Communist Party, Reimann said: The militarization policy implemented by Adenauer is increasingly leading to a dead end. As a result of implementing this policy, West German industrialists have recently earned 150 billion marks, while the working people are in poverty. Millions of workers and staff are demanding wage increases, and hundreds of thousands of workers are using strikes to fight for the fair demand for wage increases.
Reimann pointed out: The majority of West German residents are increasingly realizing that the policies of the Adenauer government and the parties that support it make German reunification impossible. According to this policy, the people of West Germany have lost their sovereignty, and West Germany will become a protectorate of the United States. In West Germany, only the German Communist Party points out a clear way out to the West German residents in its program to restore German reunification. German Communist Party members fearlessly stand at the forefront of the great national struggle to reach an agreement between Germans and to peacefully reunify our motherland on a democratic basis.
Reimann said: Adenauer is attempting to deprive the West German residents' struggle of leadership by arresting Communist Party members. It has always been the case in German history that when monopoly capitalists, militarists, and revanchists prepare to launch wars against other countries, the democratic rights and freedoms of the people are deprived and destroyed.
Reimann said: The terrorist persecution by Adenauer's judicial organs and police is not only aimed at Communist Party leaders, but also at all those who disagree with Adenauer's policies. It is also launching attacks on Social Democrats, trade union activists, and bourgeois politicians. Adenauer and the militarists hope to intimidate the West German people and weaken their struggle by persecuting and arresting German patriotic people. However, Adenauer's plan has failed. The terrorist suppression of freedom fighters and patriotic people only demonstrates the weakness of the Adenauer government. The people of West Germany are increasingly strongly demanding a change in West German policies, and demanding an agreement between residents of East and West Germany in order to restore German unity under conditions of peace and freedom.

    德共中央委员会书记里奥耶和安根福特被波恩当局逮捕
    雷曼发表谈话谴责阿登纳政府的恐怖迫害
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社柏林讯：据德意志通讯社报道，德国共产党中央委员会书记处书记弗利兹·里奥耶和尤普·安根福特在八月二十七日被西德当局逮捕。
    【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社柏林八月三十一日讯：德意志通讯社报道，德国共产党中央机关报“自由人民”报刊载了德国共产党主席马克斯·雷曼对这家报纸的记者的谈话。
    雷曼在回答该报记者提出的为什么西德最近加紧迫害德国爱国者和逮捕德国共产党领导人的问题时说：阿登纳执行的军国主义化政策，越来越走头无路了。由于执行这种政策，西德工业家最近赚得一千五百亿马克，而劳动人民却在贫困中。千百万的工人和职员要求增加工资，几十万工人用罢工来争取实现增加工资的公正要求。
    雷曼指出：西德大多数居民越来越认识到：阿登纳政府和支持这一个政府的各党派的政策使得德国统一成为不可能。根据这种政策，西德人民失去了主权，西德将成为美国的保护国。在西德，唯有德国共产党在它的恢复德国统一的纲领中向西德居民指出了明确的出路。德国共产党党员无畏地站在为德国人之间达成协议、为在民主的基础上和平统一我们的祖国而进行的伟大民族斗争的最前列。
    雷曼说：阿登纳企图用逮捕共产党党员的办法使西德居民的斗争丧失领导。在德国的历史上一贯是这样的，当垄断资本家、军国主义分子和复仇分子准备对其他国家发动战争的时候，人民的民主权利和自由就被剥夺和毁灭。
    雷曼说：阿登纳的司法机关和警察的恐怖迫害不仅针对着共产党领导人，而且也针对一切不同意阿登纳政策的人们。它同时也向社会民主党人、工会活动家和资产阶级政治家发动进攻。阿登纳和军国主义分子指望用迫害和逮捕德国爱国志士的办法吓倒西德人民并削弱他们的斗争。但是，阿登纳的这种打算落空了。对自由战士和爱国志士实行恐怖镇压只表明阿登纳政府的软弱。西德人民越来越强烈地要求改变西德的政策，要求在东西德居民之间达成协议以便在和平和自由的条件下恢复德国的统一。
