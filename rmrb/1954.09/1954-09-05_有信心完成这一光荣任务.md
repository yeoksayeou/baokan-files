The joint declaration of all democratic parties and people's organizations across the country for the liberation of Taiwan has been published in the newspapers, and a resounding call has been issued to all commanders and fighters of our People's Liberation Army, pointing out specific directions for our efforts. This is a great encouragement to us coastal defense soldiers. We have enough confidence to shoulder the glorious task of liberating Taiwan given to us by the people of the motherland.

We, who have long guarded the motherland's ocean, deeply know that unless Taiwan is liberated and the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique is completely eliminated, not only will the construction of the motherland be threatened, but even Asian and world peace will be threatened. Therefore, in the past few years, when we were carrying out our coastal defense missions, every time we thought of our important responsibility, we increased our infinite strength to overcome difficulties and achieved victories in battle. I remember one morning in June, the sea was still shrouded in thick fog, and we escorted nine hundred fishing boats back to port from a certain place. The fishing boats were full of fresh fish, which were to be sent to the people of the motherland for consumption. A total of four gunboats were assigned to the escort mission, three of which were diverted to other missions along the way due to some reason.

When the boats reached the waters of Toumen Island, gunfire suddenly erupted in front, blocking our navigation route. Our gunboats immediately bypassed the fishing boats and sailed forward against the wind and waves. It turned out that four American-made, Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's large sailing junks were intercepting our three transport ships, which were fully loaded with supplies. But the cunning enemy, upon seeing us, turned around and ran away. According to the wise judgment of Instructor Chen Lifu: the enemy would not run away so honestly and must be met head-on with a painful blow. To contain the enemy here is victory! So our gunboat chased up from the side, blocked the enemy ships' route, and began to attack. When they discovered that we only had one gunboat, they launched counterattacks continuously. Once, twice, three times, they were all repelled, and the enemy began a fourth counterattack. The artillery fire was exceptionally fierce. But behind us was the motherland's supplies, and no one was willing to back down an inch. Old cook Comrade Chen Jintang could not restrain the anger in his heart and ran to a gun position to sweep the enemy with a heavy machine gun. A burst of bullets flew over, and he was seriously injured, but he still shouted loudly: "Comrades, for the motherland, we must fight on!" The old cook's voice inspired everyone's courage to fight and increased everyone's confidence in victory. My right hand was also injured, but Comrade Chen Jintang's words made me forget the pain. I picked up the cotton yarn for wiping the machine, stuffed it into the wound, and joined the comrades in continuing the fight. The fierce battle lasted for two hours. At this time, the three sister ships arrived, and finally sank one enemy ship, while the other three were wounded and fled. This battle not only protected the nine hundred fishing boats and the supplies of the three transport ships from being damaged, but also cleared the waterway on the Toumen Island sea, and the enemy rarely dared to come here to rob again.

In just over a year, our gunboats, together with friendly ships, have engaged in more than thirty battles, and we have won every time. In total: twenty-two enemy ships of various sizes were captured, and eight enemy ships of various sizes were sunk and damaged. In the battles, the Party and the people gave us great encouragement and great honor. Our gunboat was named "Toumen Island Sea Battle Hero Boat," and Comrade Chen Lifu and I were both named combat heroes. Moreover, under the education and cultivation of the Party and the higher authorities, I became the captain of the boat. Recently, I was also elected as a representative to the National People's Congress to participate in the management of national affairs. This is truly an unimaginable thing for a child from a fisherman's family. But it has become a reality in the liberated Chinese land! Taiwan is Chinese territory, but the compatriots in Taiwan are still in dire straits today and cannot enjoy this kind of democratic rights as we do. We must liberate the Taiwanese compatriots from their suffering!

In order to support the joint declaration of all democratic parties and people's organizations for the liberation of Taiwan with practical actions, I must bring the firm belief of the coastal defense soldiers in defending the motherland and liberating Taiwan to the National People's Congress meeting, and in the future, I will bring the spirit of the meeting back to the coastal defense front. We must ensure that we work hard to study politics and modern military technology, improve our combat capabilities and command skills, and strive for victory in every battle and the final liberation of Taiwan.

    有信心完成这一光荣任务
    王维福
    报纸上公布了全国各民主党派各人民团体为解放台湾的联合宣言，并且向我们解放军全体指挥员和战斗员发出了响亮的号召，指出了具体的努力方向。这对我们海防战士来说，是一个极大的鼓舞。我们有足够的信心，来担负起祖国人民给予我们解放台湾的光荣任务。
    对于长期守卫在祖国海洋上的我们，深深知道不解放台湾，不彻底消灭蒋介石卖国集团，不仅祖国的建设受着威胁，甚至亚洲和世界和平也受着威胁。因此，在过去几年中，在我们执行海防任务时，每想起自己重大的责任，就增加了克服困难的无限力量，取得了战斗的胜利。记得是六月的一个早晨，海面上还笼罩着浓雾，我们护送着九百只渔船从某地返港了。渔船上满载着鲜鱼，这是送给祖国人民食用的。担任护送任务的共有四艘炮艇，其中三艘在途中又因故去执行别的任务了。
    船到头门山海面，突然前面响起了枪声，挡住了我们航行的道路。我们的炮艇立刻绕过渔船，乘风破浪向前面驶去。原来是四只美制蒋匪帮的大机帆船，正在拦截我方另外满载物资的三只运输船。但狡猾的敌人一看到我们，掉头就跑。根据指导员陈立富同志的机智判断：敌人不会这样老老实实地逃走，必须迎头痛击，把敌人牵制在这里就是胜利！于是我们的炮艇就从侧面追了上去，挡住敌船的去路开始攻击，当他们发现我们只有一艘炮艇时，连续进行反扑。一次、两次、三次都被打退了，敌人又开始了第四次反扑。炮火异常猛烈。但后面就是祖国的物资，谁也不肯退让一步。老炊事员陈金堂同志也忍不住心头的愤怒，跑到一个炮位上用重机枪向敌人猛扫。一梭子弹飞过来，他负了重伤，但仍高声喊叫：“同志们，为了祖国，要战斗下去！”老炊事员的声音，激励着每一个人的战斗勇气，提高着每一个人的胜利信心。我的右手也受了伤，可是陈金堂同志的话使我忘了疼痛，我随手拾起了擦机器的棉纱，塞住了伤口，和同志们一块，继续坚持战斗。激烈的战斗一直持续了两个钟头，这时，那三艘兄弟舰艇赶到了，终于打沉了一只敌船，其他三只也负伤逃窜。这次战斗，不仅保护了九百只渔船和三只运输船的物资没有受到损失，而且打通了头门山海面上的航道，以后敌人很少再敢到这里来打劫了。
    仅仅一年多的统计，我们炮艇就和友艇一起进行了三十多次战斗，每一次我们都取得了胜利。共计：俘敌大小船艇二十二艘，击沉和打伤敌大小船艇八艘。在战斗中，党和人民给了我们极大的鼓舞，也给了我们极大的荣誉。我们的炮艇被命名为
  “头门山海战英雄艇”，陈立富同志和我都被评为战斗英雄，并且在党和上级的教育培养下，我又当了艇长。最近，我又被选为全国人民代表大会的代表，来参加管理国家的大事，这对于一个渔民出身的孩子来说，真是一件不可想像的事情。但是，它在解放了的中国土地上已成了事实！台湾是中国的领土，可是台湾的同胞今天还陷入水深火热当中，不能和我们一样享受到这种民主权利。我们必须把台湾同胞从苦难中解放出来！
    为了用实际行动来拥护各民主党派各人民团体为解放台湾的联合宣言，我一定要把海防战士保卫祖国解放台湾的坚强信念带到全国人民代表大会会议上，将来还要把会议的精神带回海防前线。我们要保证努力学习政治和现代化的军事技术，提高战斗能力和指挥艺术，为争取每一个战斗的胜利和最后解放台湾而奋斗。
