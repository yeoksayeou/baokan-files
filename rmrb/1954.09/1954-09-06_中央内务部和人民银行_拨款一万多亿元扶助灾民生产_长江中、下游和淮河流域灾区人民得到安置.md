Xinhua News Agency, September 4th. The Central Ministry of Internal Affairs and the People's Bank of China have allocated 554 billion yuan in relief funds and 940 billion yuan in loans, respectively, to assist disaster victims in carrying out production for self-salvation. Disaster victims in areas along the Yangtze River and around lakes are using relief funds and loans to purchase fishing nets, repair fishing boats, and engage in fishing and other production. Local state-owned commercial departments and cooperative departments are also vigorously supplying disaster victims with daily necessities and purchasing local and special products. The Jiangsu Provincial Aquatic Products Company has decided to establish five aquatic product purchasing stations in Jiangpu County to purchase aquatic products in large quantities. The Qianjiang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hubei Province has set up purchasing and supply offices in the disaster area, allocating 3.6 billion yuan in funds, dozens of cadres, and 250 boats to transport large quantities of cooking oil, salt, cloth, and other goods for mobile supply in a timely manner to meet the needs of disaster victims. At the same time, it is also vigorously purchasing 28 kinds of sideline products from disaster victims, such as hogs, fresh fish, chickens, and ducks. The Echeng County Native Products Company and the Wuhan City Cooperative, Huangshi City, Puqi County, Luotian County, and other local food companies have signed fish sales contracts and organized women to form salted fish mutual aid groups, which has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of disaster victims for production.

Xinhua News Agency, September 5th. People in some breached areas and areas with excessive flooding and water accumulation in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Huai River basin have been evacuated from danger and resettled through the planned organization of the People's Government. In Jiangling County, Hubei Province, each district has generally established offices for receiving disaster victims to resettle the displaced people from Jianli and Jingjiang counties. Reception centers are set up every thirty miles along the way to provide disaster victims with food, tea, and medicine. Jingmen County has established a general liaison station to support the disaster area at major transportation hubs, and has equipped it with more than 200 medical personnel to treat disaster victims. Residents along the way also offered many condolences to the disaster victims. In non-disaster areas of Hunan Province, districts and townships sent people to meet disaster victims along the way, carrying luggage and moving furniture for them. People in non-disaster areas voluntarily vacated houses, beds, cooking utensils, etc. for disaster victims to use. The housing problems of more than 25,000 residents transferred from the Jingjiang flood diversion zone to Jiangling County, Hubei Province, have all been resolved. Family members of workers in Dachang Town, Nanjing City, Jiangsu Province, voluntarily organized to cook seventy to eighty buckets of porridge every day for disaster victims who had just moved from Liuhe County, and helped them clean up their houses.

In order to resettle disaster victims, the Central People's Government Revolutionary Military Commission transferred more than 3,700 tents from the Northeast and North China regions in mid-August, and the Central People's Government Ministry of Water Resources transferred 475 tents from Fushun, Guanting Reservoir, and Boshan Reservoir to support disaster victims in the Huai River region of Anhui Province. The central government also dispatched 29 plane trips to Mingluo Mountain in Huaiyuan County, Anhui Province, to airdrop large quantities of tents, flour, etc., so that the food and lodging problems of disaster victims temporarily resettled in the mountains were quickly resolved. As of the end of August, the Central People's Government Ministry of Internal Affairs had purchased 1.29 million reed mats from Beijing, Hebei, Shandong, Shenyang, Heilongjiang, and other places, and successively transported them to Wuhan City and Hubei, Anhui, and other provinces to provide temporary shelter for disaster victims transferred from the flooded areas. At the same time, large amounts of relief funds were allocated to help various places do a good job in resettlement.
