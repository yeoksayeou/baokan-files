    Farmers in the Hang-Jia-Hu Plain Area of Zhejiang Province Establish Mutual Aid and Cooperative Organizations Through Collective Drainage and Rush Planting
    In the Hang (zhou), Jia (xing), and Hu (zhou) Plain area of Zhejiang Province, mutual aid and cooperative organizations have developed during the drainage and rush planting efforts. According to statistics from seven counties including Chongde, Tongxiang, Hang County, and Changxing, there are currently around 400 agricultural production cooperatives established or being established with the approval of the local CCP committees. Several thousand mutual aid teams are also actively creating conditions to establish cooperatives. After the Hang-Jia-Hu Plain area began drainage and rush planting in June this year, the original 280-plus agricultural production cooperatives universally carried out reasonable division of labor and unified use of labor, quickly draining accumulated water from farmland. Villagers and mutual aid team members in the area saw that the cooperatives had more people, unified will, and greater strength, and the drainage work was progressing faster, so they asked to establish cooperatives. More than ten mutual aid teams in Longxuan Township, Hang County, seeing that the Guangming Agricultural Production Cooperative drained accumulated water in a timely manner, established nine agricultural production cooperatives. After most of the rice fields in Nanzhuang Township, Chongde County, accumulated water and became waterlogged, most of the farmers in the township organized twenty-six agricultural production cooperatives to uniformly use labor and agricultural tools for collective drainage, with great results.
    During the drainage and rush planting, each county universally organized mutual aid joint groups at the village level, with mutual aid teams as the core, absorbing individual farmers to participate in collective drainage. At the same time, individual farmers in each county organized more than 10,000 temporary drainage mutual aid organizations such as levee head groups and water wheel groups according to old habits, with a total of more than 100,000 farmers participating in the above organizations for collective drainage. After summarizing the benefits of collective drainage, a large part of these mutual aid organizations were consolidated into temporary mutual aid teams or upgraded to permanent mutual aid teams. According to incomplete statistics from seven counties including Chongde and Tongxiang, the number of temporary mutual aid teams has increased by more than 3,900, the number of permanent mutual aid teams has increased by more than 400, and the number of organized farmers has increased by more than 30,000 households.
    The original mutual aid and cooperative organizations in each county have also been continuously consolidated and expanded during the drainage efforts. Many agricultural production cooperatives with chaotic production management have improved their labor organization and established production responsibility systems through drainage, and some members who originally wanted to withdraw from the cooperatives have also decided not to withdraw. Most of the mutual aid and cooperative organizations in various places have promoted the method of recording work points by piece during the intense drainage, implemented the policy of mutual benefit, and many scattered mutual aid teams have also been restored and consolidated.

    浙江省杭嘉湖平原地区
    农民通过集体排涝抢种建立互助合作组织
    浙江省杭（州）嘉（兴）湖（州）平原地区在排涝抢种中互助合作组织得到发展。据崇德、桐乡、杭县、长兴等七个县的统计，目前经当地中共党委领导批准建立和正在建立的农业生产合作社共有四百个左右，并有几千个互助组正在积极创造条件要求办社。今年六月间杭嘉湖平原地区开始排涝抢种以后，原有的两百八十多个农业生产合作社普遍进行合理分工、统一使用劳动力，很快地排除了农田积水，当地乡村的互助组组员们看到合作社人多心齐力量大，排除积水工作进行较快，纷纷要求办社，杭县龙旋乡十多个互助组看到光明农业生产合作社及时排除积水后，就建立了九个农业生产合作社。崇德县南庄乡绝大部分稻田积水成涝后，全乡大部农户组织了二十六个农业生产合作社，统一使用劳动力、农具集体排涝，效果很大。
    各县在排涝抢种中普遍以村为单位以互助组为核心吸收单干农民参加组织互助联组集体排涝，同时各县单干农民并按旧有习惯组织了一万多个圩头组、车水组等临时性排涝互助组织，共有十多万农户参加了上述组织集体排涝。这些互助组织通过总结集体排涝的好处后，很大部分巩固下来成为临时互助组和提高为常年互助组。据崇德、桐乡等七个县不完全统计，目前临时互助组已增加了三千九百多个，常年互助组增加了四百多个，组织起来的农户增加了三万多户。
    各县原有的互助合作组织在排涝中也不断得到巩固和扩大，不少生产管理较乱的农业生产合作社通过排涝健全了劳动组织、建立了生产责任制，有些本来要退社的社员也决心不退了。各地互助合作组织在紧张排涝中大部推行了按件记工的办法，贯彻了互利政策，不少涣散的互助组也得到恢复和巩固。（新华社）
