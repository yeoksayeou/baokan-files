According to the instructions of the State Council of the Central People's Government, from the date of the nationwide implementation of the unified purchase and distribution of cotton cloth and the unified purchase of cotton, all private cotton cloth wholesalers and cotton peddlers in various regions shall cease business operations. Their employees shall be guided by people's governments at all levels to change professions, or be placed by the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation and supply and marketing cooperatives under the leadership of the local people's government. Private cotton cloth and cotton cloth replica retailers will be entirely transformed into state capitalist businesses through forms such as distribution and sales on behalf of state-owned commerce. This is a major step by the state in carrying out the socialist transformation of a sector of capitalist commerce.

The socialist transformation of capitalist commerce is an important part of the general task of the state during the transition period, and it is also an urgent task in planning the domestic market in a planned way. In the past few years, due to the tremendous development of state-owned and cooperative commerce, great changes have taken place in the domestic market. At present, the proportion of state-owned and cooperative commerce in the total wholesale volume of commodities in the domestic market has reached about 80 percent; in the total retail volume, the proportion of state-owned and cooperative commerce has also reached about 50 percent; coupled with the development of planned purchase and planned supply work, state-owned commerce has occupied a leading position in the country's commercial activities, and has become the leading force in the country's commerce.

In order to further develop domestic trade, invigorate the urban and rural economy, and ensure the supply of the needs of the people of the whole country, our country adopted the method of adjusting commerce in 1952, and fully utilized the positive role of private commerce in expanding the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. At that time, the state had not fully grasped the source of industrial products and major agricultural products, and the phenomenon of supply falling short of demand in the market was not significant. Therefore, it was correct to adopt the method of adjusting commerce at that time. Now that the state has basically grasped the source of industrial products and major agricultural products, and the phenomenon of supply falling short of demand in the market is becoming increasingly significant, if the method of adjusting commerce continues to be adopted, it will only encourage the speculative activities of capitalist commerce, which is detrimental to both national construction and people's livelihood. Therefore, the correct method at present must be to gradually carry out the socialist transformation of capitalist commerce industry by industry through various forms of state capitalism.

The socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises by the state is gradually realized through various forms of state capitalism. The transformation of private cotton cloth commerce also specifically embodies this spirit. Private cotton cloth wholesalers have the greatest speculation because they are connected to both cotton cloth production and cotton cloth retailers, and their destructive effect on the market and prices is also the greatest. Therefore, their wholesale business must be stopped. The state has adopted a responsible attitude towards the employees of private cotton cloth wholesalers. In addition to actively guiding them to change professions, the state has stipulated measures to properly settle those who cannot change professions. As for private cotton cloth retailers, because they are numerous and have direct contact with the majority of consumers, as long as their speculative side is strictly restricted and their side that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood is correctly brought into play, they will still have a certain role in meeting the needs of consumers. Therefore, the state has stipulated that they should be brought into the orbit of state capitalism so that they can continue to serve consumers. They either distribute and sell commodities purchased and sold by the state at prices and other conditions stipulated by the state, and obtain price differences; or they are entrusted by the state to sell certain commodities of the state at prices and other conditions stipulated by the state. These measures take into account both the historical conditions and the actual situation of our country, and also take into account the business and life of cotton cloth merchants. These are very sound and prudent measures.

Implementing the measures for the socialist transformation of private cotton and cotton cloth merchants is beneficial to national construction, the vast number of consumers, and private merchants. First of all, because private wholesalers in the entire industry of cotton and cotton cloth commerce are replaced by state-owned commerce, and private retailers are supplied with goods by state-owned commerce according to plan through state capitalist forms such as distribution and sales on commission, the capitalist factors in the commercial market will be further reduced, the leading position of state-owned commerce in the commercial market will be further enhanced, and the socialist factors will be further increased. This will be more conducive to strengthening the organization and planning of the market, and more conducive to the progress of national construction and the stability of people's lives. Secondly, due to the proper resettlement of private cotton cloth retailers, and the full utilization of the original store networks, they, under the leadership of state-owned commerce, coupled with the strength of cooperative retail stores, will form a unified distribution system, which will be conducive to further expanding domestic trade, communicating the urban and rural economy, and better serving national economic construction and the vast number of consumers. At the same time, after private retailers become distributors and sales agents of state-owned commerce, the source of goods is guaranteed, and a certain amount of turnover is maintained. As long as they do not engage in speculation and honestly serve consumers, they can obtain reasonable business income. Moreover, with the improvement of public-private and labor-capital relations, under the leadership of the state-owned economy and the supervision of the masses of workers, they can improve the operation and management of enterprises, and it is also conducive to transforming the thinking of capitalists and capitalist agents, and making them play an active and beneficial role in the process of socialist transformation as much as possible.

Cotton cloth merchants should realize the great significance of the socialist transformation of private commerce, carry forward the spirit of patriotism, and actively assist the government in implementing the policy of unified purchase and distribution of cotton cloth. After the announcement of the order for the unified purchase and distribution of cotton cloth, many distributors and sales agents were able to unify the list prices and implement clear price tags in accordance with state regulations. The past illegal acts of raising prices, shorting sizes, and other deceptions of customers have been greatly reduced. These performances are all good. All private industrialists and businessmen should firmly remember what Comrade Mao Zedong said at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in June 1950: "War and land reform are the two 'hurdles' that test all the people and all parties in China during the historical period of the New Democracy… As long as the hurdles of war and land reform are passed, the remaining hurdle will be easy to pass, that is, the hurdle of socialism, the hurdle of implementing socialist transformation throughout the country. As long as people have made contributions in the revolutionary war and in the revolutionary land system reform, and have also made contributions in the economic construction and cultural construction in the coming years, the people will not forget them when industrial nationalization and agricultural socialization are implemented in the future, and their future is bright… As long as anyone is willing to truly serve the people, and has indeed helped and done good deeds during the period when the people are still in difficulty, and has consistently done so without giving up halfway, then the people and the people's government have no reason not to want him, and have no reason not to give him the opportunity to live and the opportunity to serve." As for those few lawbreakers who resolutely resist transformation or have other intentions, they will certainly be punished by the people's law.

In order to strengthen the work of socialist transformation of private commerce, the local administrative departments for industry and commerce, state-owned commerce, and supply and marketing cooperative departments have important responsibilities. This work should closely rely on the employees in the original private stores, deeply understand the situation, resolutely implement the instructions of the State Council, strengthen market management, help distribution and sales stores improve their operations, and prevent and ban various destructive activities. Employees in private commerce should strive to raise their socialist consciousness, support the state's policy of socialist transformation of private commerce, and actively urge and help capitalists accept socialist transformation.

### 棉布商人应该服从棉布统购统销政策

    棉布商人应该服从棉布统购统销政策
    根据中央人民政府政务院的指示，自全国实行棉布统购统销和棉花统购之日起，各地私营棉布批发商和棉花商贩一律停止继续营业，其从业人员由各级人民政府辅导转业，或在当地人民政府领导下，由中国花纱布公司、供销合作社分别安置。私营棉布和棉布复制品零售商贩，则通过为国营商业经销、代销等形式，全部变为国家资本主义的商业。这是国家对资本主义商业的一个行业进行社会主义改造的重大步骤。
    对资本主义商业实行社会主义改造，是国家过渡时期总任务的一个重要部分，也是目前有计划地安排国内市场的一项迫切的任务。过去几年中，由于国营商业和合作社商业的巨大发展，国内市场情况已发生了很大变化。目前，在国内市场商品批发总额中，国营商业和合作社营商业的比重已占百分之八十左右；在零售总额中，国营商业和合作社营商业的比重也已占百分之五十左右；加上计划收购和计划供应工作的发展，国营商业在全国商业活动中，已居于主要的地位，成了全国商业的领导力量了。
    为了进一步发展国内贸易，活跃城乡经济，保证供应全国人民的需要，我国在一九五二年采取了调整商业的办法，充分利用私营商业在扩大城乡物资交流中的积极作用。当时国家还没有充分掌握工业品和主要农产品的货源，市场上供不应求的现象还不显著。因此，当时采取调整商业的办法是正确的。现在国家基本上掌握了工业品和主要农产品的货源，市场上供不应求的现象日益显著，如果继续采取调整商业的办法，就只会助长资本主义商业的投机活动，对国家建设和人民生活都是不利的。因此，目前正确的办法，就必须是经过国家资本主义的各种形式，逐行逐业对资本主义商业进行社会主义的改造。
    国家对私营工商业的社会主义改造，是通过各种不同形式的国家资本主义逐步实现的。对私营棉布商业的改造，也具体表现了这个精神。对私营棉布批发商，由于它们既和棉布的生产有联系，又和棉布零售商有联系，投机性最大，对市场和物价的破坏作用也最大，所以，必须停止它们的批发业务。对私营棉布批发商的从业人员，国家采取了负责的态度，除了积极辅导转业以外，对无法转业的，规定办法由国家加以妥善安置。至于私营棉布零售商贩，因为他们为数众多，和广大消费者有直接的联系，只要严格限制它投机的一面，正确发挥它有利于国计民生的一面，它们在供应消费者的需要上就还会有一定的作用，因此国家规定了把它们纳入国家资本主义的轨道，使它们能继续为消费者服务。它们或者是经销国家统购统销的商品，按国家规定的价格及其他条件出售，取得差价；或者是受国家委托，按国家规定的价格及其他条件，代销国家的某些商品。这些办法，既照顾了我国历史的条件和现实的情况，也照顾了棉布商的经营和生活，这是十分健全的稳妥的办法。
    贯彻对私营棉花棉布商贩进行社会主义改造的措施，对国家建设，对广大消费者，和对私商都是有利的。首先，由于在棉花棉布商业的整个行业中的私营批发商由国营商业代替，私营零售商通过经销、代销等国家资本主义的形式，由国营商业按计划供应货源，商业市场上的资本主义因素就将进一步缩小，国营商业在商业市场上的领导地位就将进一步提高，社会主义因素就将进一步增长，这就更有利于加强市场的组织性和计划性，更有利于国家建设的进行和人民生活的安定。其次，由于对私营棉布零售商贩进行了妥善的安置，充分利用了原有的商店网，它们在国营商业的领导下，加上合作社零售商店的力量，就会形成一个统一的分配系统，这就有利于进一步扩大国内贸易，沟通城乡经济，就能更好地为国家经济建设和广大消费者服务。同时，私营零售商成为国营商业的经销、代销店以后，货源有了保证，维持了一定的营业额，只要不投机倒把，老老实实地为消费者服务，就可以取得合理的营业收入，并且，随着公私、劳资关系的改善，在国营经济领导和职工群众监督下，就可以改善企业的经营管理，也有利于改造资本家和资本家代理人的思想，尽可能地使他们在社会主义改造过程中起积极的有益的作用。
    棉布商人应该认识到私营商业进行社会主义改造的重大意义，发扬爱国主义精神，积极协助政府贯彻棉布统购统销的政策。在棉布统购统销命令公布以后，不少经销、代销店都能按照国家规定，统一牌价，并实行明码标价。过去那种抬高价格、短少尺码和其他欺骗顾客的不法行为已大为减少，这些表现都是好的。所有的私营工商业者，应该牢牢记住毛泽东同志在一九五○年六月中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第二次会议上的讲话：“战争和土改是在新民主主义的历史时期内考验全中国一切人民、一切党派的两个‘关’。……只要战争关、土改关都过去了，剩下的一关就将容易过去的，那就是社会主义的一关，在全国范围内实行社会主义改造的那一关。只要人们在革命战争中，在革命的土地制度改革中有了贡献，又在今后多年的经济建设和文化建设中有所贡献，等到将来实行工业国有化和农业社会化的时候，人民是不会把他们忘记的，他们的前途是光明的。……只要谁肯真正为人民效力，在人民还有困难的时期内确实帮了忙，做了好事，并且是一贯地做下去，并不半途而废，那么，人民和人民的政府是没有理由不要他的，是没有理由不给他以生活的机会和效力的机会的。”至于那些坚决抵抗改造，或别有企图的少数不法分子，就一定要受到人民法律的制裁。
    为了加强对私营商业的社会主义改造的工作，各地工商行政部门、国营商业、供销合作社部门都负有重大的责任。这个工作应该密切依靠原有私营商店里的职工，深入了解情况，坚决贯彻政务院的指示，加强市场管理，帮助经销、代销商店改善经营，防止和取缔各种破坏活动。私营商业中的职工们，要努力提高社会主义觉悟，拥护国家对私营商业的社会主义改造政策，积极督促和帮助资本家接受社会主义的改造。
