The State-Run Lutai Farm is Growing Stronger
Spoken by Miao Fenggang, National People's Congress Representative, Repair Technician at the State-Run Lutai Farm

Built from Ruins and Wasteland

The state-run Lutai Farm is a large farm with over 52,000 mu of land. When the Japanese invaders surrendered, they wantonly destroyed the farm. After the Chiang Kai-shek bandits "took over," they completely destroyed the electric pumping stations and motors that the Japanese invaders had left behind, and even the wood used to build houses. Of the 50,000 mu of land, besides a few piles of broken bricks and tiles, there was only a vast expanse of weeds.

After liberation, when the farm director and all the personnel came to this farm, there were no dormitories, so people lived in tents set up on the weeds. In July, there were continuous heavy rains, and water flowed under the straw mats. There was no firewood, so everyone went to gather grass. When the firewood was wet, people had to go hungry. Especially when sea storms hit, the tents would take off, and people had to go to the villages ten miles away to borrow accommodation. Even so, people endured hunger and braved wind and rain, using their laboring hands to build roads day and night, and using tractors to cultivate the land covered with weeds that were as tall as a person. In 1950, the electric pumping station, which could irrigate more than 40,000 mu of paddy fields, was repaired, and the irrigation system of the entire farm was opened up. Green rice seedlings quickly grew on this desolate land.

The tractor drivers here are mostly farmers from the countryside and unemployed workers from the cities. When they started driving tractors, they were not skilled enough, and the soil they turned over could not cover the grass. Moreover, they were not skilled in operation and often had breakdowns. At that time, there were fourteen tractors, but only half of them could work, and they could only sow twenty mu per hour, and it cost half a jin of gasoline to cultivate one mu of land. This situation was quickly overcome with the help and guidance of Soviet experts. By 1951, it had increased to sixty mu per hour, and the gasoline consumption had also been reduced to 0.18 to 0.2 kilograms per mu.

In 1953, the first year that our country entered the planned large-scale economic construction, all the staff enthusiastically devoted themselves to the patriotic labor competition. When sowing rice, the tractor drivers created a new national record of sowing 114 mu per hour. When harvesting wheat, the original plan was for each combine harvester to harvest 18 mu per hour with a fuel consumption of 0.5 kilograms; all the staff used their brains, improved their technology, and created a record of harvesting 22.5 mu per hour, with the fuel consumption reduced to 0.3 kilograms. This year, the farmland had a bumper harvest, with an average yield of more than 570 jin of rice per mu, and the highest yield reached 870 jin. The phenomenon of cumulative losses over the years has been reversed, and the plan to hand in a profit of 2.425 billion yuan has been completed.

People Grow Up with the Farm

The great achievements of the farm are exciting; what is most exciting is the growth and changes of the people on the farm. Over the past few years, the farm has trained a large number of tractor drivers by combining practice and theory, and sent them to farms all over the country. What is most moving is the more than 200 beggars who were taken in from Tianjin at the beginning of the farm's establishment. They were all old and weak beggars who were wandering the streets; the state took them in, cultivated and educated them, and now they have become useful talents for the country, and some have been promoted to production management cadres. Many outstanding workers have been评选 as labor models. When labor models were evaluated in 1953, four units in the entire farm were rated as model units, and 117 employees were rated as labor models. I am one of them.

The achievements of national construction are inspiring people to move forward. I have grown up in this great era. When I was first transferred to the Lutai Farm repair team as a technician, I was not at ease. At that time, I thought: I am an old fitter for more than twenty years, but I am not allowed to return to the heavy industry department, and I am transferred to repair broken machines. What future will there be? I have been active several times and wanted to leave the farm. The Party organization discovered that I had this kind of thinking, and sent people to talk to me several times and repeatedly educated me. The people around me were also educating me. When I saw the staff working day and night to create a happy life, and when I saw the vast number of peasant brothers and sisters organized under the leadership of the state-run farm, eagerly moving towards large-scale mechanized production, I truly realized the greatness of our cause and determined to do my job well.

Loading rice into warehouses is a very difficult task. The farm produces seven to eight million jin of rice every year, which must be done manually, carrying bags one by one to the top of the warehouse, which is more than ten feet high. If you are not careful, there is a danger of falling and getting injured. Every year, I don’t know how much manpower and funds are spent just for loading and unloading warehouses. I thought: If I could get a machine, and people could turn on the machine to transport the grain into the warehouse, how great would that be! The deputy leader of the repair team, Xu Dalin, and worker Lin Junshun, and I began to study according to the principle of the C-6 combine spiral propeller. During the research process, the leaders gave me a lot of support in terms of manpower, material resources, and spirit. Although we encountered many difficulties in the trial production process, we finally succeeded. Using a grain conveyor can transport 50,000 to 60,000 jin of grain per hour. If calculated based on the farm's annual production of 10 million jin of rice, it can save the farm 3,200 man-days and save the country more than 400 million yuan.

I also worked with repair trainee Comrade Song Ying to develop a weeding machine for paddy fields. Using a weeding machine not only reduces physical labor, but also increases work efficiency by more than two times. Weeding one time saves more than 44 million yuan in wages. Then I also modified the winnowing machine to mechanize the winnowing in the autumn harvest. Using this winnowing machine is twelve to seventeen times more efficient than manual labor, and it can save the farm 40 to 60 million yuan a year. In April 1953, I honorably joined the Communist Party of China. That year, I was selected as a first-class labor model for the entire farm.

The Farm is Growing Stronger

In the past few years, under the cultivation and education of the Party, I have grown up with the growth of the farm. Today's Lutai Farm is no longer the Lutai Farm it was five years ago. The working class, who have stood up, have built an advanced state-run agricultural enterprise on a desolate wasteland with their own hands under the correct leadership of their own Party. The living standards of the farm workers have also been greatly improved. Brand-new buildings with an area of more than 23,000 square meters have been built. In addition to offices and dormitories, there are also auditoriums, libraries, clubs, canteens, bathhouses, and schools for the children of staff, as well as their own film projectors. The total number of staff has increased from more than 200 in 1949 to 940. From耕地to harvesting, threshing and finally loading into warehouses, the entire production process is mechanized, and even harvesting pasture and pulling radishes are done with machines. Cultivation techniques are improving year by year, and yields are increasing year by year. In 1950, the country produced more than 4 million jin of rice, more than 100,000 jin of cotton and soybeans; by 1953, the total grain output reached 10.07 million jin. In 1953, the average yield of rice per mu was more than 570 jin, an increase of one time compared with 1950, and about 100 jin more per mu than the local farmers.

The superiority of mechanized farming on the farm attracts the vast number of peasants to collective production. Under the leadership of the Party and the influence of the farm, the mutual aid and cooperation movement has rapidly developed in the vast rural areas around the farm. In Ninghe County, around the Lutai Farm, 225 agricultural production cooperatives and 16 cooperative farms have now been established. In Xiaobeijiangu Village, 94.4% of the farmers have joined the cooperative. (Compiled by Mi Rongyun)

    国营芦台农场越来越壮大了
    全国人民代表大会代表  国营芦台农场修理技工  苗凤刚口述
    从废墟荒地上建设起来
    国营芦台农场，是一个有五万二千多亩土地的大农场。日寇投降的时候，对这个农场大肆破坏；蒋匪军“劫收”后，又把日寇破坏剩下的电力扬水站和电动机，甚至建筑房屋的木材，都全部彻底地破坏了。五万多亩土地，除了几摊碎砖烂瓦，就只有茫茫一片的荒草了。
    解放后，场长和所有人员到这个农场来的时候，没有宿舍，人们就住在荒草上搭起的帐篷里；七月，大雨连绵，铺的谷草下面流着水；没有柴烧，大家去打草；柴草淋湿了，人们就只好饿着肚子。尤其当海上风暴袭来的时候，帐篷就腾空而起，人们只好跑到十里以外的农村去借宿。就是这样，人们忍着饥饿、冒着风雨，用劳动的双手，夜以继日地修筑着道路，用拖拉机开垦着长满了一人深的荒草的土地。一九五零年，修复了能灌溉四万多亩水田的电力扬水站，开辟了全场的灌溉系统。这块荒凉的土地上，很快就生长起来了绿油油的秧苗。
    这里的拖拉机手，大都是来自农村的农民和城市的失业工人。他们开始驾驶拖拉机的时候，技术不熟练，翻过的地盖不住草。而且操作不熟，常出故障。当时，有十四部拖拉机，只有一半能进行工作，一小时只能播种二十亩，耕一亩地要耗费半斤汽油。这种情况，在苏联专家的帮助和指导下，很快就克服了。到一九五一年就提高到了每小时播六十亩，耗费的汽油也降低到每亩零点一八至零点二公斤。
    一九五三年，我们国家进入有计划的大规模的经济建设的第一年，全场职工热烈地投入了爱国主义的劳动竞赛。在播种水稻时，拖拉机手们创造了每小时播种一百一十四亩的全国最高新纪录。收割小麦时，原计划每台收割机每小时收割十八亩，用油量零点五公斤；全体职工开动脑筋，提高技术，创造出每小时收割二十二点五亩的纪录，用油量降低到零点三公斤。这一年，农田普遍丰收了，每亩平均收稻谷五百七十多斤，最高产量达到八百七十斤。历年来的赔累现象从此扭转了，完成了上缴利润二十四亿二千五百万元的计划。
    人随着农场成长起来
    农场的巨大的成就，是使人兴奋的；最使人兴奋的，还是农场的人们的成长和变化。几年来，农场用实际和理论相结合的方法，训练培养了大批拖拉机手，输送到全国各地农场。最使人感动的，要算是建场初期从天津收容来的二百多名乞丐。他们都是流浪街头的老弱乞丐；国家收容了他们，对他们进行了培养教育，现在都变成了国家的有用的人材，有些已被提拔为生产管理干部。很多优秀的工人，被评选为劳动模范。一九五三年评选劳动模范时，全场就有四个单位被评为模范单位，有一百一十七名职工被评为劳动模范。我就是其中的一个。
    国家建设的成就鼓舞着人们前进。我就是在这个伟大的时代中成长起来的。当我初调到芦台农场修理队做技工的时候，我是不安心的。那时我想：我是一个二十多年的老钳工，不让我回到重工业部门去，把我调来修理坏机器，会有什么前途？我曾经几次活动，想离开农场。党组织发觉我有这种思想，就几次派人和我谈话，反复地对我进行教育。周围的人们也在教育着我。当我看到全场职工弟兄不眠不休，为创造幸福生活辛勤劳动的时候，当我看到广大农民兄弟在国营农场带动下，组织起来，热望走向大规模机械化生产的时候，我才真正认识到我们的事业的伟大，决心把自己的工作做好。
    稻谷装仓，是一件很艰巨的工作，农场每年生产七、八百万斤稻谷，都要用人工，一袋袋背上一丈多高的仓顶装仓，一不小心，就有跌下来摔伤的危险。每年光为装仓、倒仓，不知要用多少人工，花费多少资金。我就想：如果弄一个机器，人把机器一开，就能把粮食输入仓去，该有多好！我和修理队副队长徐达林、工人蔺浚顺就根据C—6康拜因螺旋推进器的原理开始研究；在研究过程中，领导方面从人力物料上和精神上都给了我很多支持。虽然在试制过程中遇到很多困难，但是最后终于胜利了。使用输谷器每小时能输谷五、六万斤，如以农场每年生产稻谷一千万斤计算，就可以给农场节省人工三千二百个，给国家节省资金四亿多元。
    我又和修理学员宋英同志一起研究制成了水田锄草器。使用锄草器锄草，不光减轻了体力劳动，而且工作效率提高了两倍多，除一遍草，便节省工资四千四百多万元。接着我还改装了扬场机，使秋收时的扬场也机械化了。使用这种扬场机，要比人工效率提高十二倍到十七倍，一年就可以给农场节省四千万到六千万元。一九五三年四月，我光荣地加入了中国共产党。这一年，当选为全场一等劳动模范。
    农场越来越壮大
    几年来，我就是这样，在党的培养教育下，随着农场的成长而成长着，今天的芦台农场，已不是五年前的芦台农场了。站起来了的工人阶级，在自己的党的正确领导下，用双手在一片荒凉的废墟上，建设起来了先进的国营农业企业。农场工人的生活也大大地改善了。崭新的两万三千多平方公尺面积的新建筑物兴建起来了。除了办公室、宿舍，还有大礼堂、图书馆、俱乐部、食堂、澡堂和供职工子弟学习的学校，还有自己的电影放映机。全场职工人数，已由一九四九年的二百多人，增加到九百四十人。从耕地到收割、打场以至到最后装仓，全部生产过程机械化了，连收割牧草和拔萝卜，也都用上了机器。耕作技术在逐年改进，产量在逐年增加。一九五零年给国家生产了四百多万斤稻谷，十万多斤棉花和大豆；到一九五三年，粮食总产量达到一千零七万斤。一九五三年水稻每亩平均产量是五百七十多斤，比一九五○年提高一倍，比当地农民每亩约计多产一百斤左右。
    农场机械耕作的优越性，吸引着广大农民走向集体生产，农场周围的广大农村，在党的领导和农场的影响下，互助合作运动迅速地发展起来了。在芦台农场周围的宁河县，现在已建立起了二百二十五个农业生产合作社和十六个合作农庄。小北涧沽村已有百分之九十四点四的农户入了社。（米荣运整理）
