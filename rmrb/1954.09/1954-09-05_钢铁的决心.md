Here is a symposium held by the meritorious personnel of a certain tank regiment of the People's Liberation Army. The publication of the joint declaration for the liberation of Taiwan has given everyone a lot to say. One speech followed another. Everyone shared a common view: this declaration is the voice of the 600 million people, the will of the 600 million people, and will become the action of the 600 million people! Li Youfeng, the reconnaissance section chief, a first-class model and second-class meritorious person who participated in the battles of Lunan, Huaihai, Jinan, the Yangtze River Crossing, and Zhoushan, said excitedly: "I have never forgotten the matter of liberating Taiwan for a moment. It was during the battle to liberate Zhoushan that we had just landed on Dapeng Island when we were surrounded by the local people. They cried loudly, complaining about how the Chiang bandits killed their relatives and trampled on the good people. An old woman sobbed and pulled us, saying: 'Avenge us, save our relatives, we rely on you!' Whenever I think of these things, it's like seeing the faces of the Zhoushan masses crying to us again, like hearing the voices of the Zhoushan masses crying again, and also like seeing the compatriots suffering under the rule of the Chiang bandits, expecting us to liberate them. Therefore, I feel that the task given to us by the people of the motherland has not been completely completed!" Company Commander Zhu Defu, who participated in the battle to liberate Anshan and was awarded five merits, recalled the scene when Anshan was just liberated, saying: "At that time, the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant had become a ruin, everything was in a mess, there were Kuomintang bunkers everywhere, and even the steel furnaces destroyed by the Japanese devils had become fortifications for the Chiang bandit troops...." However, in the few years since liberation, Anshan has become the steel capital of the motherland, the base of heavy industry. He firmly stated: "The socialist construction of the motherland must not be allowed to be sabotaged, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique must be eliminated, and we must liberate Taiwan and complete our entire task of liberating all of China."

The Ninth Company of a certain unit stationed in Beijing, which won the honorary title of "Double Meritorious Company" in the battle to liberate Taiyuan, expressed that they would carry forward the past combat tradition, step up military training, and support the joint declaration for the liberation of Taiwan with practical actions. And they have already done so. Not many days ago, they held a tactical exercise of "Infantry Company in the Attack." Under the scorching sun, the entire company marched more than forty miles to reach the exercise site, and then dug fortifications for eight or nine hours, but no one complained of hardship or fatigue. Just as the attack began, there was a torrential rain, and the water in the deep places submerged the knees, but the comrades still waited for the order to launch the attack with vigor. The order was issued, the tanks crossed the trenches, and the soldiers advanced bravely. Finally, they won. Afterwards, they said: Good exercises in peacetime lay the foundation for the battle to liberate Taiwan!

    钢铁的决心
    黎莹、田畯
    这里是解放军坦克某团的功臣们召开的座谈会。解放台湾的联合宣言的公布，使大家有很多心里的话要说。发言一个接着一个。大家有一个共同的看法，这个宣言是六万万人民的声音，是六万万人民的意志，并将成为六万万人民的行动！曾参加过鲁南、淮海、济南、渡江、舟山等战役的一等模范、二等功臣侦察股长李友风同志激动地说：“解放台湾这件事，一时一刻我也没有忘记过。那是在解放舟山战役的时候，我们刚在大鹏岛登陆，就叫当地的老百姓给围了上来。他们放声大哭，哭诉着蒋匪如何杀死他们的亲人，如何蹂躏善良的人民。一个老太太泣不成声地拉着我们说：‘给我们报仇，救回我们的亲人，就靠在你们身上了！’我什么时候想到这些，就像又一次看到舟山群众向我们哭诉的面孔，就像又一次听到舟山群众哭诉的声音，同时也仿佛看到还在蒋匪统治下受苦受难的同胞期待我们去解放的情景。因此，就觉得祖国人民给我们的任务还没有彻底完成！”连长朱德福同志，曾参加过解放鞍山的战斗，立过五次功。他在回想起鞍山刚解放时的情景说：“那时，鞍山炼钢厂已成了一片废墟，到处乱七八糟，到处是国民党的碉堡，连被日本鬼子毁坏的炼钢炉也成了蒋匪军的工事……。”可是，解放后几年来，鞍山已变成了祖国的钢都，重工业的基地。他坚决表示：“祖国的社会主义建设决不容破坏，蒋介石卖国集团必须消灭，我们一定要解放台湾，完成我们解放全中国的全部任务。”
    驻京某部九连，在解放太原战役中，曾获得
  “双功连”的荣誉称号。他们表示：要发扬过去的战斗传统，加紧军事训练，以实际行动来拥护为解放台湾的联合宣言。并且，他们已经这样做了。不几天前，他们举行了“进攻中的步兵连”战术演习。在烈日下，全连行军四十多里到达了演习场所，接着又挖了八、九小时的工事，但没有一个说苦叫累的。进攻刚开始时，又下了倾盆大雨，水深的地方淹没膝盖，但同志们仍英姿勃勃地等待着发起进攻的命令。命令下达了，坦克越过了堑壕，战士们个个奋勇前进。终于胜利了。事后他们表示：平时演习好，就为解放台湾的战斗打下了基础！
