    Old Engineer
    —Remembering the People Building Anshan
    By Our Correspondent Lu Hao
    Many people are looking for Cheng Shitong, the chief engineer in charge of the construction of the Second Thin Plate Mill, but no one can find him. Among those looking for Cheng Shitong, some are from the Rolling Mill Engineering Company to discuss with him the specific time for the next technical lesson; some are from the Communist Youth League branch to invite him to attend a Communist Youth League meeting on a certain day; and there are also foremen, bricklayer team leaders, and concrete workers who come to ask him for instructions on specific engineering issues.
    In the small, poorly lit construction site office, there is a damp smell. Perhaps because the room is small and crowded with people, the air feels a bit stuffy. Some wipe the sweat from their foreheads, preparing to sit down and wait for him to return; others seem impatient, turning around and stepping out of the doorway, intending to look for him again. Just then, the branch secretary of the Third Construction Section walks into the office.
    He knows that these people are here to find Cheng Shitong. He says, "Go to Oil Depot No. 12 to look for him; he's likely to be there." The young man behind him puts on an air of knowingness and adds, "Finding people requires knowing the trick. To find him, just ask where the project is most urgent or where problems have occurred, and you'll find him for sure."
    Sure enough, Cheng Shitong went to Oil Depot No. 12 early this morning.
    The project at Oil Depot No. 12 had already been completed. Yesterday, during cleaning, water was suddenly discovered seeping from the ground under the oil depot, filling bucket after bucket, like a spring gushing outwards.
    A leaking oil depot is, of course, a big problem.
    Cheng Shitong is now standing under the "foundation," his eyes intently fixed on a small pit in the concrete foundation, gazing at the water seepage. When there is a little more water, he bends down and puts one hand into the water, rubbing his fingers together, as if trying to discover something in the water.
    Some say that the waterproofing layer wasn't done well and that there was a problem; others estimate that there was a problem with the concrete pouring. There are many theories, but no one can be sure. Zhou Wenguang, the foreman in charge of the construction, asks anxiously again and again, "Chief Cheng (as people on the construction site affectionately call him), is it leaking?"
    Cheng Shitong has not answered.
    After a long time, he climbs up from under the "foundation." He is wearing a set of dark blue cotton clothes. Although his body is covered in mud and the cloth shoes on his feet are already soaked, his gentle demeanor makes it clear at a glance that he is an old professor or engineer. He is fifty-three years old and quite stout, but climbing up from a "foundation" six meters deep doesn't seem to bother him at all.
    After coming up, he wipes his black-rimmed glasses with a handkerchief while slowly shaking his head, saying, "It doesn't seem like the oil depot is leaking."
    Clearly there is water in the oil depot, but the old engineer says it doesn't seem like it is leaking, which many people at the oil depot don't understand.
    Cheng points to the foundation's base and continues, "It's very likely that this is water coming out of the concrete. Because the water has stayed in the concrete for a long time, it's not very cold. Plus, grass mats were used during curing, so the water is slippery and a little yellowish."
    Before leaving, he sends someone to watch the water changes, instructing them to check whether the water is rising or falling at regular intervals.
    Although this is a rare situation in Cheng Shitong's thirty years of work in the engineering field, based on his rich and practical experience on-site, the facts are exactly as he judged. The water from Oil Depot No. 12 decreases day by day. During this time, he comes several times a day, and after a week, no water can be seen in Oil Depot No. 12.
    To further confirm whether his judgment is correct, Cheng Shitong orders the drainage well to stop pumping water, allowing the groundwater level to gradually rise. As a result, the oil depot remains dry as usual, and he is completely certain that the oil depot is not leaking.
    Speaking of water, some of our young engineering and technical personnel often lack the necessary vigilance regarding seemingly harmless groundwater. Whenever this happens, he always says, "I have suffered for decades, and these sufferings must not be repeated now."
    Cheng Shitong, who graduated from the Department of Civil Engineering at Tangshan Jiaotong University more than twenty years ago, has long dealt with seaports and reservoirs, accumulating rich experience. But in his own words, in the past, he "harbored great ambitions but had nowhere to use them." Now, he can dedicate all of his talents to the cause of the motherland's peaceful construction.
    Not long ago, when he was responsible for the construction of an oil depot at another site, he simultaneously used several methods to prevent groundwater intrusion. For example, in addition to making a waterproof layer, he also made drainage ditches and left drainage wells. Later, after he left that site, some engineering technicians felt that the oil depot was well-built and didn't leak, so the remaining water wells and pumps were both unsightly and unnecessary. As a result, they filled the well. Unexpectedly, when the well was filled, the groundwater rose, and because the waterproof layer wasn't well made, the oil depot leaked.
    Someone suggested using waterproofing agents to stop the leak. After Cheng Shitong heard about it, he said, "Waterproofing agents can't permanently block high-pressure water." They didn't believe him and applied the waterproofing agent. On the first day, the bottom of the oil depot, which originally had water, seemed to be blocked. They came to tell Chief Cheng. Chief Cheng said, "Go back and see if the walls are leaking." They went back and saw that the bottom was not leaking, but the walls were leaking. After they applied waterproofing agent to the walls, the hallway leaked the next day. And just when the hallway seemed to stop leaking, the bottom, which had been blocked earlier, leaked again.
    In the end, Cheng Shitong's old method was used. The blocked drainage well was re-excavated, and when the groundwater rose to a certain level, the drainage well pumped it away. This way, the oil depot didn't leak.
    If drainage ditches and water wells hadn't been prepared in advance, and multiple waterproofing methods hadn't been adopted, the oil depot would have caused us too much trouble.
    In the early stages of construction of our Second Thin Plate Mill, groundwater was also a major problem. Here, groundwater is generally found below three meters. But now that the project has been completed, no trace of water can be seen here, and it's hard not to think of the enthusiastic help that Chief Engineer Cheng Shitong gave our young technicians and workers.
    During the tense days of construction, Cheng Shitong often took foremen, apprentice technicians, and workers to the "foundation" to explain how to ensure no leakage and how the waterproof layer should be operated. Sometimes he even braved the smoky fumes of foul-smelling asphalt, following behind the oilers, telling them the key points of flattening the seams. He paid special attention to checking small things that everyone didn't notice, such as whether the scaffolding was solid, whether the lines of the tiles were straight... Wherever he went, you could hear everyone welcoming him, saying:
    "Old Engineer, how do you think we're doing?"
    "Chief Engineer, please take a look for us. What shortcomings do we have?"
    Once, Cheng Shitong passed a toilet that was under construction. He opened the door and saw a young worker laying tiles. When the worker saw him, he said, "Chief Engineer, please give me some feedback on my work."
    Cheng Shitong looked at it and showed a satisfied expression, saying, "Your work is already good. If you insist on me giving some advice," he pointed to two tiles and said, "These two tiles are not laid flat enough."
    The young worker explained, "That's because of the materials."
    Cheng Shitong pointed to two other tiles with uneven corners and said, "This is because of the materials; but those two, it's because the work wasn't done properly."
    Seeing that the chief engineer was more careful than he was in these small details, the tile-laying worker immediately wanted to take the two tiles down and redo them. Cheng Shitong stopped him and said, "That's not necessary. Because taking those two tiles down will affect the surrounding tiles."
    Early the next morning, Cheng Shitong passed by that toilet again and saw the young worker digging up the tiles he had mentioned yesterday.
    "What are you doing?" Cheng Shitong asked him.
    The young worker replied, "I always feel uncomfortable if I don't redo it properly."
    Cheng Shitong, who has worked in the engineering field for more than twenty years, saw an ordinary worker listening to his opinions so carefully. As a chief engineer, he felt even more how heavy the responsibility on his shoulders was.
    In October 1953, the construction of the cable trench at the Second Thin Plate Mill site began. The cables of a factory are like the blood vessels of a person, playing an important role. However, at the place where the construction was to take place, there were already dozens of pipes of varying thicknesses, as well as water wells and heating pipes, spreading underground in a complex manner like the roots of a tree.
    After the cable trench project started, Cheng Shitong, in addition to handling some of the most necessary things in his office every day, almost always stayed with the workers in the cable trench, covered in mud and water. Sometimes it was already past ten o'clock in the evening, and he hadn't left yet, and in the middle of the night, he was seen taking a car to the construction site again. He would help deal with a burst water pipe for a while and then busy himself planning how another pipe should be moved.
    On a day when the ice and snow were melting, the retaining wall on the north side of the cable trench suddenly collapsed, and Cheng Shitong was hit by the collapsing bricks, almost being buried. As soon as they heard that the cable trench had collapsed, everyone rushed to find the chief engineer, only to see him wiping the mud off his face while calmly greeting everyone, "It's okay, I just got hit a little on the arm." He continued working without much concern.
    At this time, the Spring Festival was fast approaching. And the cable trench was tying rebar and supporting wooden formwork, and according to the progress of the project, concrete was to be poured precisely during the Spring Festival.
    If the concrete pouring work could be completed one day in advance, then the electrical installation project could be carried out one day in advance, and the entire process could be moved forward by one day. On our construction site, the speed of one process often affects the progress of the entire project.
    In order to ensure that the project could proceed intensively, many people decided to respond to the call of the construction site leaders and not go home for the Spring Festival this year.
    Everyone knew that Chief Engineer Cheng's wife and children had been living in Shenyang for a long time, and someone said to Cheng Shitong, "Your home is very close; go back and see them and then come back."
    Cheng Shitong replied, "You are not leaving, how can I leave you? I am so old, I have already spent many Spring Festivals. This year, I will spend the Spring Festival with you."
    On the first day of the Lunar New Year, Cheng Shitong came to work at seven o'clock in the morning.
    On the second night of the Lunar New Year, at a little past eight o'clock, Cheng Shitong had just returned home when a call came from the construction site.
    "Is there a problem with the cable trench?"
    "Yes, the surveying team found that the retaining wall on the cable trench is three millimeters out of alignment."
    "Has the support been checked?"
    "It has been checked, and no problems were found. It would be best if you could come and take a look," the person on the construction site said anxiously.
    "Okay, I'll come right away."
    In less than half an hour, Cheng Shitong, his face flushed with cold, appeared on the construction site in the minus twenty-degree cold, trudging through the mud and ice.
    He checked all the supports one by one, added additional supports, and then conducted a specific study with the comrades of the Technical Security Section, closely monitoring the continued changes in the wall. By the time he returned home, it was already ten o'clock in the evening.
    It was originally planned that the rebar and wooden formwork could be tied and supported by the second day of the Lunar New Year, but thanks to the efforts of all the comrades, these tasks were completed a day ahead of schedule on the first day of the Lunar New Year. In this way, the plan to start pouring concrete on the third day was completed by two o'clock in the afternoon on the second day.
    The cable trench project was completed. Some were helping to connect the heating pipes, preparing to heat the poured concrete with steam; others came to help clean up. Cheng Shitong, dragging a straw mat to cover the poured concrete, couldn't suppress his inner joy. He said to everyone, "Look at how meaningful our Spring Festival was. We did so much for our motherland during the Spring Festival. By the time others come to work, we have already completed the cable trench." Although he was already over half a century old, he was radiant and energetic, and his face couldn't help but reveal a kind of indescribable joy that engineering and technical personnel habitually show when a project is completed.

    老工程师
    ——记建设鞍山的人们
    本报记者　陆灏
    很多人都在找负责第二薄板厂工程施工的总工程师程世通，但谁也没有找见。这些来找程世通的人，有的是从轧钢工程公司来和他商量下一次讲授技术课的具体时间的；有的是从团总支来请他列席某一天的青年团团员大会的；还有工长、瓦工组长和混凝土工人，他们是来向他请示工程的具体问题的。
    矮小的、光线不大充足的工地办公室里，散发着一种潮湿的气味，大约是屋子小，而人又拥挤得很多，空气显得有些浑浊。有的擦擦头上的汗珠，准备坐下来等他回来；有的表现得很躁急，回过头来跨出门槛，打算再出去寻找。恰巧这时候，第三工段的支部书记走进办公室来了。
    他知道这些人都是来找程世通的。便说：“你们到十二号油库去找，他很可能在那里。”跟在那后面的那个小伙子装出一副懂事的得意的样子补充说：“找人也要会找窍门。要找他，只要打听哪里工程最紧张，哪里工程发生了问题，就到哪里去找，准没有错。”
    果然，今天一早，程世通就到十二号油库去了。
    十二号油库的工程，本来已经结束，昨天清扫的时候，忽然发现油库地下冒水，一会儿存一桶，一会儿存一桶，好像泉水似地向外涌。
    油库漏水了，这当然是个大问题。
    程世通现在站在“基础”底下，他的两只眼睛聚精会神地盯在混凝土地基的那个小坑里，凝视着出水的情形。等水稍许多一些了，他就弯下腰去，一只手伸在水里，手指头互相搓弄着，要在水里面发现什么东西似的。
    有人说这是防水层没有做好，出了毛病了；有人估计这是混凝土浇灌发生了问题，说法很多，但谁也拿不定主意。负责施工的工长周文光担心地一遍一遍在问：“程总（工地上的人都这样亲切地称呼他），是不是漏水？”
    程世通一直没有回答。
    停了很长的时间以后，他从“基础”底下爬上来。他穿着一套藏青色的棉衣服，尽管是身上粘满了泥水，脚上的布鞋也已经湿透了，但那文质彬彬的举动，使人一看就能猜到他是个老教授或老工程师。他已经五十三岁了，且身体较胖，但从六公尺深的“基础”底下爬上来，根本显得毫不在乎的样子。
    他上来以后，一面用手帕擦着他那副黑边的眼镜；一边缓慢地摇摇头说：“这不像是油库漏水。”
    明明是油库有水，而老工程师却说不像是油库漏水，这话使油库上很多人都不大理解。
    只见程总指着“基础”的地基接着说：“很可能这是混凝土出水。由于水在混凝土里停留的时间较长，所以现在这水不是很凉的。加上养生的时候盖了草垫子，所以水很滑，而且有点发黄。”
    他临走的时候，还派了一个人在这里专门看水的变化，他吩咐每隔一定的时间，看看这水是上升还是下降。
    虽然这是程世通在工程界三十多年工作以来少见的情形，但凭着他在现场上所得到的丰富和实际的经验，事实完全像他判断的那样，十二号油库出的水，一天比一天少下去了。在这个时间里，他每天总要来好几次，一个星期以后，十二号油库就根本看不到水了。
    程世通为了更加切实地了解自己的判断是否正确，他通知排水井停止抽水，让地下水的水位逐渐升高，结果油库仍然干燥如常，他这才完全断定油库确实没有漏水。
    说到水，我们有些年青的工程技术人员，对于表面上看起来不太厉害的地下水，往往还缺乏应有的警惕。每逢这样的时候，他总要说：“我已经吃过几十年苦头了，这些苦头，现在决不能再重复了。”
    二十几年以前在唐山交通大学土木系毕业的程世通，曾经长期和海港、水库打过交道，积累了丰富的经验。可是用他自己的话来说，过去都是“怀抱雄心，无处插手”。而现在，他就能把自己全部的才能贡献给祖国和平建设的事业了。
    不久以前，他在另外一个工地负责油库施工的时候，他同时采用了好几种方法，防止地下水的侵袭。比如除做了防水层以外，还做了排水沟，留了排水井等等。后来，他离开了那个工地，有的工程技术人员觉得油库做好了，没有漏水，留下的水井和抽水泵，既很难看，也觉得没有什么必要了。结果他们填塞了这个水井。想不到水井一填塞，地下水上升了，由于防水层做得不好，油库漏水了。
    有人提议用防水剂堵漏水。程世通知道以后说：“有高压力的水，防水剂是不可能把它永久堵住的。”他们不相信，就涂防水剂。第一天，本来有水的油库底层，看来是被堵住了。他们来告诉程总。程总说：“你们回去看看墙上漏不漏？”他们回去一看，果然，底层不漏，墙上却又漏水了。他们在墙上涂了防水剂以后，第二天，过道又漏水了；而眼看过道不漏水以后，早先堵好的底层又漏水了。
    最后还是采用了程世通的老办法，把那个被堵上的排水井，重新挖开来，等地下水上升到一定水位时，排水井就把它抽走了。这样油库就不漏水了。
    要是没有在事前做好了排水沟，挖好水井，采用了多方面的防水的办法，那油库给我们的麻烦就太大了。
    在我们第二薄板厂工程动工初期，地下水也曾经是个大难题。在这里，一般的地基在三公尺以下就有水，而现在工程已经完工了，这里却看不到一点点水的痕迹，人们就很难不想起总工程师程世通给过我们青年技术人员们和工人们很多热心的帮助。
    在施工紧张的日子里，程世通常常带着工长、见习技术员和工人们在“基础”上给大家讲怎样可以保证不漏水，防水层应该怎样操作等等。甚至有时候他还冒着充满了恶臭的沥青油的烟雾，跟在油工的后面，告诉他们烫平接缝的要点。他特别还注意检查一些大家不注意的小事情，比如说脚手架垫得结实不结实，磁砖的线对得直不直……。只要他走到那里，你就可以听到大家欢迎地说：
    “老工程师，你看我们做得怎么样？”
    “总工程师，你帮我们看看吧，我们还有些什么缺点？”
    有一次，程世通经过一个正在施工的厕所，他推开门一看，见一个青年工人正在铺磁砖。工人一见是他，便说：“总工程师，请你对我的工作提一点意见吧。”
    程世通看了一下，显出一种满意的神气说：“你的工作已经做得不错了，如果你一定要让我提点意见，”他用手指着两块磁砖说：“这两块磁砖，还铺得不够平。”
    那个青年工人解释说：“那是材料关系。”
    程世通指着另外两块四个角不齐的磁砖说：“这是因为材料关系；而那两块，还是工作没有做到。”
    铺磁砖的工人见总工程师在这些小地方比自己还细心，他就马上要把那两块磁砖取下来重做。程世通劝止了他说：“那就不必了。因为取这两块磁砖，是会影响周围别的磁砖的。”
    第二天一早，程世通又一次走过那个厕所的旁边，只见那位青年工人正在他昨天说过的地方挖磁砖呢。
    “你在弄什么？”程世通问他。
    那个青年工人回答说：“我不把它重新整理好，我心里总是别扭。”
    在工程界工作了二十多年的程世通，看到一个普通工人这样认真地听取自己的意见，作为一个总工程师，他就更加觉得身上的责任是如何的重大了。
    一九五三年十月，第二薄板厂工地开始了电缆沟的施工。一座工厂的电缆，正像一个人身上的血管一样，有着重要的作用。可是，就在这准备施工的地方，原来就有粗粗细细几十根管子，还有上、下水井和暖气，像大树的根，错综复杂地蔓延在地下。
    电缆沟的工程开工以后，程世通除了每天在他的办公室里处理一些最必要的事情以外，他几乎一直连泥带水和工人们一起钻在电缆沟里。有时已经晚上十点多钟了，他还没有走，而到了半夜，又看见他坐了汽车到工地来了。他总是一会儿帮助处理挖破的水管；一会儿又去忙着筹划另外一根管子应该怎样挪动。
    在一个冰雪融化的日子，电缆沟北部的保护墙突然坍塌下来，程世通被坍下来的砖头打着了，他差一点被埋起来。一听说电缆沟坍塌，大家都急着找总工程师，只见他一面擦着脸上的烂泥；一面安详地招呼大家说：“不要紧，我不过是膀子上被打着一点点。”他不大在乎地又继续工作起来了。
    这时候，已经很快就要临近春节了。而电缆沟里正在绑钢筋、支木模，按照工程的进度，恰巧正在春节期间要浇灌混凝土。
    浇灌混凝土的工作如果能够提前一天完成，那么电气安装的工程就可以提前一天进行，整个的工序也都可以向前推进一天，在我们工地上，常常一个工序的迟或快，影响着整个工程的进行。
    为了保证工程能够紧张地进行，很多人都决定响应工地领导上的号召，今年不回家过春节了。
    大家知道程总工程师的妻子儿女都长时期住在沈阳，有人就向程世通说：“你家离得很近，回去看看再来吧。”
    程世通回答说：“你们都不走，我怎么能离开你们。我岁数这样大了，已经过了不少春节，今年，我就和你们一起过春节吧。”
    旧历正月初一，程世通在清早七点钟就来上班了。
    初二晚上八点多钟，程世通刚刚回家不久，工地上就来了电话。
    “是不是电缆沟出了毛病了？”
    “是的，测量队发觉电缆沟上的保护墙歪了三公厘。”
      “支撑检查过了吗？”
    “检查过了，没有发现有毛病。最好你来看一看。”工地上的人不放心地说。
      “好吧，我马上来。”
    不到半小时，程世通冻得满脸通红，踏着泥泞和冰雪，在零下二十度严寒的工地上出现了。
    他一个一个地检查了所有的支撑，另外又加了支撑，最后还和技术保安科的同志作了具体研究，密切注视这垛墙的继续的变化。他回到家里，已经又是晚上十点钟了。
    本来预计旧历正月初二可以绑完钢筋支好木模，由于全体同志的努力，结果这些工作在初一就提前完成了。这样，准备初三开始浇灌混凝土的计划，到了初二下午两点钟就一切都完工了。
    电缆沟工程结束了。有人在帮忙接暖气管子，准备为浇灌好的混凝土进行蒸气加热；有人也来参加清扫，程世通一面拖着一个草垫子去盖在已经浇灌好的混凝土上；一面压不住内心的喜悦。他对大家说：“看看我们的春节过得多么有意义啊。我们在春节里为我们的祖国做了这样多的事情，别人来上班，我们已经把电缆沟做好了。”他虽然已经年过半百，但红光满面，精力旺盛，他的脸上不由得流露出一种工程技术人员在工程完工时候所惯有的那种难以形容的喜欢。
