    【新华社二十一日讯】东京消息：由日中友好协会主持，为增进中日两国人民友好关系而举行的“日中友好月”已从十五日正式开始。日本各地人民正在以庆祝中国国庆和欢迎中国红十字会代表访问日本为中心，积极筹备和展开各项友好活动。
    按照原订计划，在十月一日前后，日本各地将举行庆祝大会、讲演会、电影会、图片书籍展览会等，以庆祝中国国庆。在“日中友好月”期间，日本人民还将和中国人民进行写贺信、互相交换民间艺术品等友谊活动。
    为了广泛地展开今年的“日中友好月”活动，日中友好协会决定在各地成立包括各阶层人民和各种团体在内的委员会。日中友好协会东京都联合会正在积极筹备成立这样的委员会，并决定由这个委员会兼任欢迎中国红十字会代表的工作。日中友好协会东京都联合会已经决定在九月下旬到十月下旬期间，举行多种多样的活动，来庆祝中国国庆，欢迎访问日本的中国红十字会代表和增进中日两国人民的友好。
    在“日中友好月”正式开始前，日中友好协会东京都联合会曾预定在“日中友好月”内推销三万本“人民中国”和“中国画报”，但从九月一日起的一周内就卖出了五千本。
