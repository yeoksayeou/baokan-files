    The Frustration of a Conspiracy
    Lian Yunshan
    Around nine o'clock on the night of January 6th this year, People's Liberation Army sentries guarding Tantou Island in eastern Zhejiang Province suddenly heard the faint sound of a ship's engine coming from the sea, followed by a burst of clear gunfire, and then everything went silent again.
    The sentries wondered, "What ship could be out there on a night like this, with such strong sea winds? And why the gunfire?" They immediately reported this situation to their superiors and kept a more vigilant watch on the sea. Before long, they spotted two figures slowly crawling onto the island from the sea...
    "Halt!" a sentry shouted.
    The two dark figures froze.
    The sentries ran up to the two men and found their equipment very strange: they were wearing black tights, carrying American submachine guns, and holding axes, handcuffs, and compasses.
    It turned out that these two were armed Kuomintang (KMT) spies who had defected from Dachen Island, one named Chen Bisheng and the other Guo Datou. After explaining their intentions and surrendering their weapons, they were immediately taken to the military authorities.
    Chen Bisheng and Guo Datou were originally fishermen from eastern Zhejiang, and they had been living happy lives after liberation. However, misfortune and disaster suddenly struck them. In 1950 and 1952, they were captured by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops while fishing at sea and forced into the bandit army. Guo Datou and Chen Bisheng were in the same team. Guo Datou was a later addition and often wept secretly because he missed his hometown and wanted to return to the mainland. Chen Bisheng had been harboring similar thoughts for some time, and when he discovered Guo Datou's feelings, he often approached him. After that, they often confided in each other in their native dialect, which the bandit army couldn't easily understand, and discussed finding an opportunity to escape back to the mainland.
    However, they soon parted ways. In January of last year, Chen Bisheng was forcibly sent to the "Western Enterprises Company Dachen Branch," an American spy agency on Dachen Island, to receive training in demolition techniques. Then, in June of last year, Guo Datou was also forcibly sent to Chiang Kai-shek's KMT spy training class in Tamsui to receive underwater demolition training. In the American and KMT spy schools, they were instructed daily to practice swimming, diving, and rowing rubber boats, as well as methods for blowing up bridges, warehouses, docks, merchant ships, and naval vessels. They were also taught how to erase their conscience, betray their motherland, and sabotage the peaceful labor of the people of the motherland. Coincidentally, when Guo Datou completed his training and was transferred to Dachen Island, he was assigned to the same team as Chen Bisheng. They had another chance to confide in each other. So they agreed that they would escape back to the mainland at the first opportunity.
      On January 5th of this year, American spy Mike Men planned a conspiracy to send armed spies into our mainland. Eight KMT-American spies were assigned to carry out Mike Men's conspiracy, including Chen Bisheng and Guo Datou. Their mission was to sneak into Tantou Island and kidnap a People's Liberation Army sentry in order to gather military intelligence about our coast. Mike Men howled to the bandits, "Alive is what we want, not dead!"
        On the evening of January 6th, the conspiracy began. The bandits sailed towards Tantou Island on a motorized sailboat. In addition to the eight spies, there were more than twenty KMT soldiers providing cover, and Mike Men personally directed the operation. Two KMT warships followed behind to provide support. At around nine o'clock in the evening, the bandit ship stopped about six hundred meters from Tantou Island. It was already dark and a strong wind had picked up. The bandits immediately launched an American-made rubber boat, and the eight spies then jumped into the rubber boat. The spy leader, Liang Dong, sat in the middle with a pistol, Chen Bisheng was assigned to steer, and Guo Datou was assigned to row... With the arrangements made, the bandits rowed the rubber boat quickly towards Tantou Island.
    At this moment, conscience was calling to Chen Bisheng and Guo Datou, and the thought of returning to the mainland and reuniting with their families was overwhelming them. They thought, "The opportunity to escape back to the mainland that we have been waiting for day and night has come, and we must seize it!" So, they whispered a few words in their native dialect and made a plan. When the rubber boat was about to approach Tantou Island, Chen Bisheng kicked Guo Datou with his foot and immediately used his submachine gun to sweep at Liang Dong and the three spies rowing on the left side. At the same time, Guo Datou also used his submachine gun to kill the two spies in front. Then, they took six submachine guns and other military supplies, waded ashore, and surrendered to the People's Liberation Army.
    Chen Bisheng and Guo Datou abandoned the darkness and turned to the light. After returning, they received generous treatment from the People's Liberation Army. The People's Liberation Army gave them travel expenses to return home and reunite with their families, allowing them to rejoin the happy peaceful labor. Furthermore, because they killed six KMT-American spies and seized weapons, the People's Liberation Army also awarded them five million yuan in prize money.
    The conspiracy planned by the American spy Mike Men was thus thwarted. (Attached pictures)

    阴谋的破灭
    连云山
    今年一月六日夜里九点钟左右，守卫浙东檀头岛的人民解放军哨兵，忽然听到从海上隐约地传来一阵轮船的马达声，不一会又传来一阵清晰的枪声，然后，一切又沉寂了。
    哨兵们心里想，这样的深夜，海风又很大，哪里来的轮船？为什么又响起枪声？他们立刻把这一情况报告上级，同时更加警觉地监视着海面。不一会儿，他们发现两个人影慢慢地从海里爬上岛来……
    “站住！”一位哨兵大喝一声。
    两个黑影不动了。
    哨兵们跑到这两个人面前一看，发现他们的装备非常奇怪：身穿黑色紧身衣，带着美国冲锋枪，手里还拿着斧头，手铐和指北针。
    原来这两个人是从大陈岛来向我投诚的美蒋武装特务，一个叫陈必胜，一个叫郭大头。他们在说明来意和缴下武器之后，立刻被带到军事机关去了。
    陈必胜和郭大头原先都是浙东的渔民，他们在解放后，都过着幸福的日子。但是，不幸和灾难突然向他们袭来，一九五○年和一九五二年，他们在海上捕鱼时先后被蒋匪军抓去，编到匪军部队中去了。郭大头和陈必胜编在一个队里，郭大头是后来的，他常常因为思念家乡，想回大陆而偷偷痛哭。陈必胜早有这样的心事了，当他发现郭大头的心事以后，就常和郭大头接近。此后，他们两人就常用匪军不容易听懂的家乡话，偷偷地互诉心情，商量找机会逃回大陆。
    可是，他们不久就分手了。去年一月里，陈必胜被强迫派到大陈岛上的美国特务机关——“西方企业公司大陈分公司”去，受爆破技术的训练；接着，郭大头也在去年六月间被强迫派到淡水的蒋匪特务训练班去，受水底爆破训练。在美蒋的特务学校中，他们每天被指定练习游泳、潜水和划橡皮船，以及爆破桥梁、仓库、码头、商船和舰艇的方法；每天被教唆如何抹煞自己的良心，背叛自己的祖国和破坏祖国人民的和平劳动。可是，事情很凑巧，当郭大头受训完毕被调往大陈岛后，又和陈必胜编到一起了。他们又有机会互诉心情了。于是他们就相约，一有机会就逃回大陆。
      今年一月五日，美国特务麦克门策划了一个派遣武装特务潜入我国大陆的阴谋。八名美蒋特务被指定去执行麦克门的阴谋，陈必胜和郭大头也在内。他们的任务是：潜入檀头岛，绑架一名人民解放军哨兵，以便刺探我国沿海的军事情报。麦克门向匪徒们嗥叫着：“只要活的，不要死的！”
        一月六日傍晚，阴谋开始了。匪徒们乘着一只机帆船向檀头岛驶来。船上除掉八名特务外，还有二十几个匪军掩护，麦克门并且亲自指挥。船后还有两艘匪军舰艇跟随助威。晚上九点钟左右，匪船驶近距离檀头岛约六百公尺的海面，停止了前进。当时天已漆黑，并已刮起了大风，匪徒们立刻投下一只美国造橡皮船，八名特务接着跳到橡皮船上，特务头目梁东拿着手枪坐在中间，陈必胜被指定掌舵，郭大头被指定划桨……布置已定，匪徒们就划着橡皮船迅速地向檀头岛驶来。
    这时，良心在召唤着陈必胜和郭大头，重回大陆和家人团聚的念头在冲击着他们。他们想，自己日夜盼望的逃回大陆的机会到来了，一定要抓住这个机会！于是，他们就又用家乡话轻声说了几句，计划一番。等橡皮船将要驶近檀头岛时，陈必胜就用脚把郭大头一踢，立刻用冲锋枪向梁东和左边三个划船的特务扫去，同时，郭大头也用冲锋枪打死了前面的两个特务。接着，他们就带着六枝冲锋枪和其他军用品，涉水登陆，向人民解放军投诚了。
    陈必胜和郭大头弃暗投明，回来以后，受到了人民解放军的宽大待遇。人民解放军发给他们路费，让他们回家和家人团聚，使他们重新投入幸福的和平劳动。并且，由于他们杀死了六名美蒋特务和缴获了武器，人民解放军还发给他们五百万元的奖金。
    美国特务分子麦克门所策划的这次阴谋，就这样破灭了。（附图片）
