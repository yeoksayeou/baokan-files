    The Prosperous and Happy Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
    Europe's Largest Children's Department Store
    A European largest children's department store is under construction in the central area of Moscow. The building has eight floors with a total volume of 300,000 cubic meters and can receive 200,000 customers per day. The business hall of the department store will occupy three floors, and there will also be children's cafes, children's dining halls, food departments, and winter gardens. The walls of the building will be decorated with marquetry paintings with Russian folk tales as the theme. The walls and pillars will be inlaid with colored marble. The floor will be paved with granite. The metal frame of this building has been erected, and the walls are currently being built.
    Europe's Largest Cold Storage
    Europe's largest cold storage is under construction in the Cherkizovsky district of Moscow. This cold storage has seven floors and can store tens of thousands of tons of food at the same time. Its walls are made of 30 cm thick prefabricated wall panels, which are characterized by extremely low thermal conductivity. Each floor of the cold storage has various cold storage rooms, and their temperature can be adjusted to zero to minus 30 degrees Celsius as needed. The refrigeration technology equipment is very complete. The first part of the cold storage project is expected to be completed this year, and finishing work is currently underway, equipping elevators, cranes, and other equipment.
    Twenty-Eight-Story Hotel
    The construction of a new 28-story hotel in Moscow has been completed. This magnificent building is 135 meters high from the ground to the gilded national emblem on the top of the building, with a usable living area of 24,000 square meters. At present, the interior of the hotel is being installed with specially designed equipment and decorations, and the colors are extremely harmonious.
    New Hall of the Underground Tramway Station
    The "Red Gate" station of the Moscow Underground Tramway recently built a magnificent new hall—the new entrance to the station. The new hall has three elevators leading to the platform of the "Red Gate" station. The new hall was built under complex geological conditions. Artificial soil freezing method was used when excavating the foundation pit, which was the first time in the world. This hall is built very luxuriously. The walls are faced with rose and light blue marble produced in Uzbekistan, the ceiling is also exquisitely decorated, and the floor is paved with black and red granite from Ukraine. Many huge and beautiful hanging lamps illuminate the entire hall brilliantly.
    Astonishing Development of the Vitamin Industry
    The Soviet vitamin industry has undergone astonishing development. In 1950, vitamin production had increased tenfold compared to the pre-war year of 1940, and it is expected that production will increase twenty-fivefold compared to 1940 next year. This year, new giant vitamin factories will be built near Moscow, in the Volga River Basin, and in Ukraine. The production technology of the vitamin industry has also greatly improved. The industrial production process of riboflavin, vitamin B6 and other products has been greatly simplified. After adopting the new method researched by Soviet scientists, the chemical synthesis process of vitamin B6 has been reduced from the usual ten reactions to six reactions, and the production time has been reduced by half compared to before.
    Factory for Manufacturing Watch Diamonds
    The Kusa Precision Technology Stone Factory is a first-class giant factory in the South Urals, but its daily products can just fill a cigarette case. It turns out that it manufactures watch diamonds, and the smallest diamonds it produces are so small that they can hardly be seen with the naked eye. There are many precision machines in the factory. It takes about 70 processing steps to make a gemstone into a watch diamond. First, the gemstone is cut into cubes, parallelepipeds, or cylinders, and then it is flattened, polished, and some need to be drilled. Precision drilling machines can drill holes of one-tenth of a millimeter. Inspectors inspect products with microscopes. The innovators of this factory are constantly improving production. Compared with 1946, the cost of manufacturing a set of watch diamonds has been reduced by 80%, and the labor consumption has been reduced by nearly 90%.
    Producing 200 Billion Cigarettes a Year
    This year, the Soviet tobacco industry will manufacture 200 billion various cigarettes, which is double the pre-war year of 1940. In the past, the Far East, the Urals, Siberia, and the Baltic Sea coast, which relied on the import of tobacco products from other parts of the Soviet Union, will establish 15 tobacco factories in the past two or three years. The Soviet Union has large areas of land for growing tobacco, and there are particularly many varieties, which enables the tobacco industry to produce a variety of cigarettes to suit all possible hobbies. Now, all tobacco factories in the Soviet Union have adopted new tobacco processing technology. Various factories are installing pneumatic machines to separate broken leaves and remove dust, and many factories have adopted electric fermentation methods. A special machine designed by engineer Babenkov completely automates the fermentation process.
    Dried Foods and Baby Foods
    The Mikoyan Food Factory in Moscow produces two million bags of dried foods every day. This food is a semi-finished product supplied to housewives for cooking meals. The factory produces according to the production process prescribed by scientists, which can both preserve the nutritional value of the food and preserve the fresh taste. It only takes ten to fifteen minutes for families to use them to make a breakfast or dinner that suits their tastes. Recently, the Mikoyan Food Factory also opened a department specializing in the production of highly nutritious baby food. It can produce 100,000 bags of baby food every day according to the ingredients formulated by the Institute of Nutrition of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences. In order to ensure absolute cleanliness during processing, this department is equipped with marble floors, white tile walls, and all equipment is made of stainless steel and porcelain.

    繁荣幸福的苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟
    欧洲最大的儿童百货公司
    莫斯科中心区正在建筑一座欧洲最大的儿童百货公司。这座大厦共有八层楼，总体积为三十万立方公尺，每天可接待二十万顾客。百货公司的营业大厅将占三层楼，此外还设有儿童咖啡馆、儿童食堂、食品部和冬季花园。建筑物的墙上将装饰以俄罗斯民间故事为主题的镶木细工画。墙壁和柱子都将镶上彩色的大理石。地板将用花岗石铺成。这个建筑物的金属构架已经架设起来了，目前正在砌墙壁。
    欧洲最大的冷藏库
    莫斯科的契尔基速夫区正在建筑一座欧洲最大的冷藏库。这座冷藏库共有七层楼，能同时储藏几万吨食品。它的墙壁由三十公分厚的预制壁板砌成，这种壁板的特点是传热性极低。冷藏库的每层楼都有各种冷藏室，它们的温度可按照需要调节到零度至零下三十度。冷藏技术设备都是非常完善的。预计冷藏库的第一部分工程将在今年完成，现在正在进行修饰工作，装备升降机、起重机及其他各种设备。
    二十八层楼的大旅馆
    莫斯科一座有二十八层楼的新旅馆的建筑工程已经完工了。这座宏伟的大厦从地面到建筑物尖顶上的镀金国徽有一百三十五公尺高，可使用的居住面积为两万四千平方公尺。目前旅馆的内部正在安装经过特别设计的各种设备和装饰品，色彩极为调和。
    地下电车道车站的新外厅
    莫斯科地下电车道“红门”车站最近建筑了一幢宏伟的新外厅——车站的新入口。新外厅有三个电梯通往“红门”车站的月台。新外厅是在复杂的地质条件下建设的。在挖掘基坑时曾采用了人工冻土法，这在世界上还是第一次。这座外厅建筑得十分富丽堂皇。墙壁用乌兹别克出产的玫瑰色和浅蓝色的大理石镶面，天花板也精工装饰，地板由乌克兰的黑色和红色花岗石铺成。许多盏巨大而美丽的挂灯把整个大厅照耀得辉煌灿烂。
    维他命工业的惊人发展
    苏联的维他命工业有了惊人的发展。一九五○年维他命产量已增为战前一九四○年的十倍，预计明年产量将增为一九四○年的二十五倍。今年莫斯科附近、伏尔加河流域以及乌克兰等地将有新的巨型维他命工厂建成。维他命工业的生产技术也大大进步了。核黄素、维他命乙6等产品的工业生产过程已大大简化。在采用了苏联科学家研究出的新方法后，维他命乙6的化学合成过程已由通常的十个反应减少到六个反应，生产时间比以前减少了一半。
    制造表用钻石的工厂
    库萨精密技术制石工厂是南乌拉尔一个第一流的巨型工厂，可是它每天的产品却正好装满一个香烟盒。原来它是制造表用钻石的，它所生产的最小的钻石小到几乎连肉眼都看不见。工厂里有很多精密机器。一颗宝石制成表用钻石大约要经过七十道加工手续。首先把宝石切成立方体、平行六面体或圆柱体，然后磨平、磨光，有的还要钻孔。精密的钻孔机可以钻十分之一毫米的孔。检查员检查产品都用显微镜。这个工厂的革新者不断改进生产。和一九四六年比较，制造一套表用钻石的成本减低了百分之八十，劳动消耗差不多减低了百分之九十。
    一年产两千亿支香烟
    今年苏联烟草工业将制造出二千亿支各种各样的香烟，即增为战前一九四○年的二倍。以前靠苏联其他地方输入烟草制品的远东、乌拉尔、西伯利亚和波罗的海沿岸等地，最近两三年内将建立十五个烟草工厂。苏联有大片的土地种植烟草，并且种类特别繁多，这使烟草工业能生产各种各样的香烟，以适合各种可能的爱好。现在，苏联所有的烟草工厂都采用了新的烟草加工技术。各个工厂都在装设气力机来分离碎叶和除去灰尘，许多工厂采用了电力发酵法。工程师巴本科夫设计的一种特制机器，使发酵过程完全自动化了。
    干制食品和儿童食品
    莫斯科的米高扬食品工厂每天生产二百万袋干制食品。这种食品是供给家庭主妇烹调餐食的一种半制品。工厂根据科学家规定的生产过程进行生产，既可以保存食品中的营养价值，又可保存新鲜味道。家庭中用它们做一顿合乎自己口味的早餐或晚餐，只要十分钟到十五分钟就行了。最近米高扬食品工厂还开设了一个专制营养价值很高的儿童食品的部门。它每天可以生产十万袋根据苏联医学科学院营养研究所规定的成分配制的儿童食品。为了保证加工时的绝对清洁，这个部门装了大理石地板、白瓷砖墙壁，所有设备都是用不锈钢和瓷做的。　（据新华社讯）
