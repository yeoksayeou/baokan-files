    Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, September 20th: The French Federal Forces, in violation of the ceasefire agreement, used cannons, tanks, and aircraft to massacre civilians in Yinshan Village and Zhicheng Village, Tuy An County, Phu Yen Province, central and southern Vietnam. Residents along the highway between these two villages were also victims of these atrocities. The French Federal Forces massacred the wounded on the spot and opened fire on children and adults hiding in bushes or trenches. They looted the people's property, raped women, and tore the flag of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to shreds. In order to eliminate evidence of their crimes, they poured kerosene on the corpses and set them on fire, or buried them. In this incident, seventy-four civilians were massacred, fifty-six civilians were injured, and fifteen people went missing.

    The aforementioned crimes lasted for three days from September 7th to 9th, occurring in areas from which the Vietnam People's Army had recently withdrawn to its temporary garrison. This is the most serious violation of the ceasefire agreement committed by the French Federal Forces since the Indochina ceasefire.

    Regarding this incident, the delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army to the Central Joint Ceasefire Commission has lodged a strong protest and requested the Central Joint Ceasefire Commission to send a mobile investigation team to the aforementioned locations to investigate. The delegation of the Vietnam People's Army also suggested that the International Supervisory and Control Commission should send representatives to participate in this investigation team.

    Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, September 20th: General Van Tien Dung, Chief Delegate of the Delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army to the Central Joint Ceasefire Commission, wrote a letter to General Delteil, Chief Delegate of the Delegation of the General Headquarters of the French Federal Forces, on September 17th to protest the massacre of civilians in Yinshan Village and Zhicheng Village.

    General Van Tien Dung, after recounting the aforementioned crimes, wrote: These are irrefutable evidence of acts violating the Geneva Accords and the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference. We strongly protest the massacre of our compatriots in Yinshan and Zhicheng. We believe it is necessary to point out the serious nature of the continuous occurrence of such incidents. This proves that the French Federal Forces do not respect the Geneva Accords and the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference.

    General Van Tien Dung continued: However, the General Headquarters of the French Federal Forces, disregarding the request in our Memorandum No. 27 of September 13, 1954, still refuses to state its views. The aforementioned acts of violating the agreement and the silence of the General Headquarters of the French Federal Forces have led us to believe that these incidents are not individual acts of undisciplined elements within the French Federal Forces, but rather planned and organized crimes.

    We would like to emphasize that these acts violating the ceasefire agreement should be stopped. If the favorable atmosphere that both sides have a responsibility to maintain and develop is undermined, the French Federal Forces shall bear full responsibility.

    越方强硬抗议法兰西联邦部队屠杀平民
    认为必须制止法方这种有计划有组织的严重罪行
    【新华社二十日讯】越南通讯社北越二十日讯：法兰西联邦部队破坏停战协定，用大炮、坦克和飞机屠杀中越南部富安省绥安县银山村和志成村的平民。住在这两个村庄之间的公路一带的居民也都成了这些暴行的牺牲者。法兰西联邦部队把受伤的人当场屠杀，并向那些藏在树丛或壕沟里的儿童和成人开枪。他们抢劫人民的财产，强奸妇女，并把越南民主共和国的国旗撕得粉碎。为了消灭罪证，他们把尸体浇上煤油点火烧掉，或者把尸体埋起来。在这一事件中，有七十四个平民被屠杀，五十六个平民受了伤，还有十五个人失踪。
    上述的罪行从九月七日到九日持续了三天，发生的地方是越南人民军最近才从那里撤到临时驻扎地的地区。这是自从印度支那停火以来法兰西联邦部队对于停战协定所犯的最严重的破坏罪行。
    关于这次事件，越南中央联合停战委员会的越南人民军总司令部代表团已经提出强硬的抗议，并要求中央联合停战委员会派遣一个机动调查小组到上述的地点去调查。越南人民军代表团并建议国际监督和监察委员会应派遣代表参加这个调查小组。
    【新华社二十日讯】越南通讯社北越二十日讯：越南中央联合停战委员会越南人民军总司令部代表团首席代表文进勇将军九月十七日写信给法兰西联邦部队总司令部代表团首席代表戴尔特尔将军抗议屠杀银山村和志成村的平民。
    文进勇将军在追述了上述的罪行以后写道：这些都是违反日内瓦协定和日内瓦会议最后宣言的行为的不容辩驳的证据。我们强硬抗议屠杀银山和志成的同胞。我们认为有必要指出连续发生的这类事件的严重性质。这证明了法兰西联邦部队不尊重日内瓦协定和日内瓦会议最后宣言。
    文进勇将军接着说：但是，法兰西联邦部队总司令部不顾我们一九五四年九月十三日的第二十七号备忘录上的请求，仍然拒绝说明它的见解。上述破坏协定行为和法兰西联邦部队总司令部的默不作声已使我们认为这些事件并不是法兰西联邦部队里的不守纪律分子的个别行为，而是有计划有组织的罪行。
    我们愿意着重指出：这些违反停战协定的行为应当予以制止。如果双方都有责任予以维持并发展的有利气氛遭到破坏的话，法兰西联邦部队应负完全的责任。
