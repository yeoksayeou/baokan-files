Short Commentary:

    The experience of Beijing in combining vegetable production and sales through contracts, published in today's newspaper, is worth referencing and learning from by all major and medium-sized cities across the country. This is the correct path to promote vegetable production in the suburbs of major and medium-sized cities, strengthen production and sales planning, and meet the growing needs of urban residents.

    Due to the rapid advancement of national economic construction, the urban population has increased, and people's living standards have improved, the demand for fresh vegetables has also surged. However, the vegetable land in the suburbs of cities is limited, and agricultural production technology is not yet high, so vegetable production in several major and medium-sized cities and industrial and mining areas cannot keep up with the growth in demand. At the same time, individual vegetable farmers who are small commodity producers still account for a considerable proportion. They cannot produce according to the actual needs of the cities but are instead subject to the price of the free market for blind and unplanned production. In addition, the sale of vegetables in many cities currently goes through private "brokers" and the multiple layers of exploitation by speculative vegetable merchants, and prices are manipulated by them. This has resulted in insufficient production, supply and demand imbalances, unstable vegetable prices, and impacts on the lives of urban residents. Therefore, it is necessary to promote the active participation of individual vegetable farmers in the cooperative movement and gradually transform private vegetable merchants in the free market. Only by rapidly increasing vegetable production can we gradually adapt to the growing need for vegetables of urban residents.

    The benefits of Beijing's promotion of the system of combining vegetable production and sales through contracts lie, first and foremost, in the fact that supply and marketing cooperatives, through combined contracts, control a certain amount of vegetables, which enables them to stabilize vegetable prices with greater certainty, lead the market, and basically overcome the phenomenon of "a fast horse cannot catch up with the vegetable business." Secondly, supply and marketing cooperatives themselves can gradually strengthen planned management and, based on the distribution and needs of consumers, gradually transform the irrational distribution of vegetable distribution markets, organize direct supply, and reduce circulation links. After implementing combined contracts, Beijing also established vegetable purchasing and wholesale stations and new-style markets in industrial and mining areas, cultural areas, and residential areas, adopting the method of "using local materials and supplying locally" to solve the vegetable supply problem in remote suburban areas. It also piloted the direct combination of agricultural production cooperatives and urban consumer cooperatives to solve the vegetable supply problem in urban areas. These are all very beneficial experiences. More importantly, combined contracts also promote the enthusiasm of individual vegetable farmers to participate in the cooperative movement, which is an important aspect of increasing vegetable production.

    However, to make the system of combining vegetable production and sales through contracts increasingly perfect, unremitting efforts must be made. Supply and marketing cooperatives must strengthen the ideological education of the personnel of the private vegetable businesses that have been taken over and establish their perspective of serving producers and consumers. They must strengthen market operation and management, improve work efficiency, reduce costs, and stabilize vegetable prices. Agricultural production cooperative members should continuously receive education on supporting urban industrial construction and the worker-peasant alliance, overcoming the spontaneous tendency to blindly pursue high prices, and especially strengthening the education of vegetable salespersons of agricultural production cooperatives. In the current situation of insufficient vegetable supply or seasonal surplus in major and medium-sized cities, it is also necessary to strengthen internal transportation and external sales work, so that various regions can share what they have and make seasonal adjustments to each other, and further strengthen planning. The unplanned chaotic situation in which some cities grab vegetables from other regions when there is a shortage, and some regions uniformly restrict procurement from other places, must be quickly corrected. The effective way to solve this is to promote production and sales combined contracts between regions.

    This year, due to the early rainy season and concentrated rainfall, vegetables in the suburbs of many major and medium-sized cities have suffered significant losses. Currently, in addition to actively mobilizing and organizing farmers to expand the sowing area of autumn vegetables and encouraging farmers to rush to plant early-maturing vegetables such as spinach, cabbage, and rapeseed, supply and marketing cooperatives should also combine with local vegetable farmers in drainage, replanting, and other work to vigorously supply the means of production to solve the difficulties of vegetable farmers in production, and should continue to develop vegetable production and sales combined contracts between supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural production cooperatives, control the sources of autumn and winter vegetables, and ensure the supply of vegetables in the future.

    推行蔬菜产销结合合同制
    今日本报刊载的北京市蔬菜产销结合合同的经验，是值得全国各大中城市参考和学习的。这是促进大中城市郊区蔬菜生产，加强产销计划，满足城市人民日益增长的生活需要的正确途径。
    由于国家经济建设突飞猛进，城市人口增加，人民生活提高，新鲜蔬菜的需要量也随之激增。而城市郊区菜地有限，农业生产技术也还不高，因此若干大中城市及工矿区的蔬菜生产赶不上需要的增长。同时小商品生产者的个体菜农还占相当大的比重，他们不可能根据城市的实际需要进行生产，而是受自由市场价格的支配进行盲目的无计划的生产；加之，目前很多城市的蔬菜销售，多通过私人“牙行”和投机菜商的重重剥削，价格受其操纵。这就造成了生产不足、供求失调、菜价不稳而影响城市人民生活的情况。因此必须促进个体菜农积极参加合作化运动，对自由市场私营菜商逐步进行改造。迅速地增加蔬菜生产，才能逐步适应城市人民对蔬菜日益增长的需要。
    北京市推行蔬菜产销结合合同的好处，首先就在于供销合作社通过结合合同，掌握了一定数量的蔬菜，就能比较有把握地平稳菜价，领导市场，基本上克服了“快马赶不上青菜行”的现象。其次，供销合作社本身也可以逐步加强计划经营，并根据消费者的分布与需要，逐步改造蔬菜集散市场分布不合理的现象，组织直线供应，减少流通环节。北京市在推行结合合同以后，又相应地在工矿区、文化区和居民区建立蔬菜收购批发站和新型市场，采取了“就地取材、就地供应”的方式去解决远郊区的蔬菜供应问题；又试行了农业生产合作社与城区消费合作社直接结合的方式去解决市区的蔬菜供应问题，这都是非常有益的经验。更加重要的，是结合合同也促进了个体菜农参加合作化运动的积极性，而这又是增加蔬菜生产的重要环节。
    但是，要使蔬菜产销结合合同的制度日趋完善，还必须进行不懈的努力。供销合作社要加强对接受下来的私营菜行的人员的思想教育，树立其为生产者和消费者服务的观点。加强市场的经营管理，提高工作效率，降低成本，平稳菜价。对农业生产合作社社员，应不断地进行支援城市工业建设和工农联盟的教育，克服片面追逐高价的自发倾向，特别要加强对农业生产合作社蔬菜推销员的教育。各大中城市在目前蔬菜供应不足或季节性过剩的情况下，还必须加强内运外销工作，使各地互通有无，互作季节性的调剂，进一步加强计划性。目前有些城市缺菜时，到其他地区乱抓一把；有些地区一律限制外地采购等无计划的混乱状况均必须迅速纠正。而解决的有效办法就是推行地区之间的产销结合合同。
    今年由于雨季早，雨量集中，不少大中城市郊区蔬菜遭受较大的损失，目前各地除积极动员和组织农民扩大秋菜播种面积，鼓励农民抢种菠菜、白菜、油菜等早熟蔬菜外，供销合作社还应结合当地菜农排水、补种等工作，大力供应生产资料，以解决菜农生产上的困难，并应继续发展供销合作社和农业生产合作社的蔬菜产销结合合同，掌握秋、冬菜货源，保证今后蔬菜的供应。
