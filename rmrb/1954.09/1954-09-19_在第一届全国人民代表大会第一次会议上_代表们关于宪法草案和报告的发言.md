At the first session of the first National People's Congress, representatives spoke about the draft constitution and the report.

**Speech by Wu Yuzhang**

Chairman, fellow representatives:

Our first National People's Congress is about to adopt the great Constitution of the People's Republic of China. This is a historic event of great significance in the political life of our people.

The Constitution of the People's Republic of China was drafted by Comrade Mao Zedong on behalf of the Communist Party of China and led the Constitution Drafting Committee to draft it. The birth of this fundamental law of the state proves that Marxism-Leninism has achieved and will continue to achieve victory in China. Our constitution is based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism—especially the Marxist-Leninist theory of the state and law—summarizing the experience of our country in struggling for people's democracy and drawing on the experience of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, and it is perfectly formulated according to the actual situation in China. Our constitution not only consolidates the achievements of the people's democratic revolution and national construction in legislation; it also takes the laws of production development and social economic development as the starting point, stipulating that our country, through state organs and social forces, through socialist industrialization and socialist transformation, will gradually eliminate the system of exploitation, establish a socialist society, and reflect the fundamental requirements of the country in the transitional period and the common aspirations of the people nationwide. The constitution stipulates that all state organs shall practice democratic centralism, to mobilize and unite the people of the whole country to complete the general tasks of the transitional period of the state and to oppose internal and external enemies, the role of the people's democratic united front led by the Communist Party of China will continue to be played; to strengthen the unity of all nationalities, it is stipulated that in areas where ethnic minorities live together, ethnic autonomy shall be practiced, and in economic construction and cultural construction, the needs of all nationalities shall be taken into account, and in the issue of socialist transformation, full attention shall be paid to the characteristics of the development of all nationalities, so that all nationalities can unite into a family of equality and freedom. Throughout the constitution, the truth of Marxist-Leninism's dialectical materialism and historical materialism is reflected. This people's constitution will become a great positive force to guarantee and promote the complete victory of socialism in our country.

After the adoption of the constitution, a wide, in-depth, and nationwide propaganda and education campaign should be carried out. This is an important condition for the implementation of the constitution. From the perspective of education, our constitution and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft constitution are concrete examples of the combination of theory and practice, and they are also good textbooks for learning scientific socialism. The propaganda and education of the constitution in the country should be regarded as a long-term and fundamental political work, as a basic content of the patriotic education and socialist education of the people. Our state organs and various social mass organizations as well as propaganda and education organizations should regard the propaganda and education of the constitution as their important responsibility, adopt various effective methods and utilize various appropriate conditions, carry out propaganda and education work among the broad masses of urban and rural people, so that the spirit of the constitution can be known to every household and deeply rooted in people's hearts, become the behavioral norms of every individual in social life, and promote the work of national management and construction.

Learning the constitution is the responsibility of the whole people. The people of the whole country should understand the content of the constitution and the relationship between the constitution and their own interests, exercise their rights according to the constitution, enjoy the rights they should enjoy, fulfill the obligations they should fulfill, improve their socialist awareness and the sense of being the master of the state, and give full play to their political initiative and labor enthusiasm. We representatives of the people's congresses at all levels, as messengers sent by the people to the state power organs at all levels, should first study the constitution thoroughly, set an example, and become models for propagating and observing the constitution. All state organ workers are servants of the people and must study the constitution seriously, strengthen the rule of law, act according to the constitution, be loyal to the people's democratic system, obey the constitution and laws, and strive to serve the people. The younger generation is the future of our country, and constitutional education is of great significance to them. We should enable the broad young people to understand the constitution, love the motherland, and actively prepare to become loyal builders and defenders of the socialist cause of the state. Therefore, I think that in middle schools and higher schools, we should appropriately adopt the experience of constitutional education in the Soviet Union, and list the Constitution of the People's Republic of China or courses including the content of the constitution as compulsory political courses, so as to carry out systematic education.

Now, the people of the whole country are joyfully welcoming the solemn birth of their first great constitution. I believe that under the brilliant light of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, the people of the whole country will be more united, and in participating in all the undertakings of the state, they will show boundless strength and strive to build our country into a great socialist state!

**Speech by Lai Ruqu**

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I think that Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report has expressed the most thorough views of the Chinese working class on the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China.

After the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China was published, the broad masses of workers and staff across the country enthusiastically studied and discussed it, and put forward many suggestions for supplementation and revision. To welcome the convening of the National People's Congress and to celebrate the constitution that will be formulated at this meeting, the workers and staff across the country have, in the past few months, carried out labor competitions more universally and deeply, and achieved more results on the production front. The actions of the broad masses of workers and staff are more powerful than any words in showing their support and approval of the draft constitution.

Why do the workers and staff across the country support the draft constitution so enthusiastically? Because they see not only that the fruits of the struggle of the working class and the people of the whole country have been consolidated in the draft constitution, but also that our country is gradually transitioning to a socialist society. As Comrade Liu Shaoqi explained in detail in his report: our constitution is a people's democratic constitution, which is of the socialist type, not of the bourgeois type. The working class enthusiastically pursues this great goal of socialism, so it also enthusiastically supports this draft constitution. Workers in Shanghai said: "With the people's constitution, the construction of a socialist society is more solid." This sentence represents the feelings of workers across the country.

The broad masses of workers and staff have seen more clearly from the draft constitution the leading position of the working class in the state, that is, the position of the master. The leading role of the working class guarantees the victory of socialist construction and socialist transformation; at the same time, this leading position also gives the working class a special responsibility. That is, in socialist construction and socialist transformation, the working class must play a leading role.

Of course, the working class led by our great party, which has been tested for a long time, is definitely able to shoulder this glorious responsibility. But we should also admit that there are weaknesses in the ranks of the working class. Due to the rapid growth of the working class, due to the fact that we are still in the vast sea of small producers, due to the existence of the bourgeoisie, and due to the existence of many shortcomings in trade union work, the habits of small producers and the influence of the bourgeoisie are still very common and serious in the ranks of the working class. In the ranks of the working class, phenomena such as not observing labor discipline, not cherishing state property, and not paying attention to unity and mutual assistance are still major problems. Not to mention that the cultural and technical levels of the working class are still in a backward state at present. However, the great cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation precisely requires the working class to be not only politically and organizationally strong, but also to have a high level of culture and technology. The working class must continuously improve its level of awareness and organization, must strive to learn culture, learn and master advanced production technology, and with a spirit of innovation, improve our technical foundation. Only in this way can we continuously improve labor productivity, guarantee the achievement and surpassing of various indicators of the state plan, and accelerate our pace of progress.

Socialist construction and socialist transformation are a complex and arduous struggle. The working class not only needs to faithfully observe the state's laws and regulations, but also must be most vigilant in safeguarding the state's laws and regulations, and wage a resolute struggle against those who sabotage the state's laws and regulations, sabotage the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation. The implementation of this constitution will make our struggle more organized and orderly.

Undoubtedly, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China, the Chinese working class will certainly carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition, overcome weaknesses, strive for progress, and unite more closely with the people of the whole country, with high enthusiasm, firm faith, and heroic labor, struggle for the implementation of this constitution, and struggle for the gradual transition to a socialist society. A socialist society will definitely be built on the great land of our motherland.

**Speech by Chen Qiyou**

Chairman, fellow representatives:

Our draft constitution, from the first draft submitted to today's final discussion at the first session of the first National People's Congress, has been half a year. In this half year, the people of the whole country have had the opportunity to discuss it and have put forward many opinions. The Constitution Drafting Committee has revised it several times to make it reach today's form. Now, although the spirit and structure of this draft constitution are not much different from the initial draft, the content and expression have been more enriched and perfected. The drafting of this document itself shows how democratic it is.

This draft constitution is the crystallization of the struggle of our people for more than a hundred years, especially in the past thirty years, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, and it will also be the guiding light for our country from the completion of the new democratic revolution to the construction of a socialist society. I wholeheartedly support this draft constitution and support Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on this draft constitution. I propose to unanimously adopt this constitution.

Our constitution is a constitution that is completely in line with the wishes of the people of the whole country and is the most perfect one in our country's history. But the implementation of the constitution still depends on the people of the whole country and the staff of state organs to strictly observe it. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, our country has achieved great achievements in all aspects, which even our enemies cannot deny; but in these great achievements, due to the fact that some cadres did not fully understand and observe the policies and instructions of the central government, some deviations were caused, which made the people dissatisfied and the government's prestige was also affected, which is undeniable. In our province of Guangdong, in the land reform movement, some overseas Chinese issues were handled improperly, which caused a bad influence overseas, which is one example. The occurrence of such deviations is indeed due to the fact that the cadres who executed the work did not investigate and study beforehand and did not report to their superiors, but the fundamental reason is that they do not care about the interests of the people, so that good things are turned into bad things.

Now the draft constitution clearly states: "All state organs must rely on the masses, maintain close contact with the masses, listen to the opinions of the masses, and accept the supervision of the masses." It also says: "All state organ workers must be loyal to the people's democratic system, obey the constitution and laws, and strive to serve the people." I hope that from now on, the staff of our state organs must strictly implement every word and sentence of the constitution. The people of the whole country should not give up their rights, take the spirit of being the master of the house, and constantly supervise the staff of state organs, so that things that harm the interests of the people will not happen again, and our bright and great future will be even more brilliant.

Representatives! When we are here participating in the first session of the first National People's Congress of our country to formulate the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, we are extremely joyful and excited. However, our territory of Taiwan is still occupied by American imperialism, and several million compatriots are still living in a life of water and fire under the rule of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and his clique. On August 22 of this year, various democratic parties and people's organizations issued a joint declaration for the liberation of Taiwan. We firmly support this joint declaration and will spare no effort to strive for the early liberation of Taiwan. Justice is on our side, and we will definitely liberate Taiwan.

**Speech by Ye Jianying**

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully support the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China. This is a fundamental law that represents the greatest and most long-term interests of the people of all ethnic groups in our country. I propose that the meeting adopt it. Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft constitution uses the profound theory of Marxism-Leninism and the complex reality of our transitional period to correctly and concisely explain many major issues in the draft constitution. I fully agree with this report. The draft constitution has undergone three months of nationwide discussion, tempered and refined, and has gained the unanimous support of the whole country, becoming a material force to inspire the people of the whole country to speed up socialist construction and socialist transformation and fight, and a great force to inspire the people's army to be vigilant, improve technology, strictly observe discipline, strengthen unity, and defend the great motherland against the aggression and sabotage of domestic and foreign enemies.

The Chinese people have learned from historical lessons and personal experiences that they should recognize the truth based on facts. By comparing our true people's democratic system with the hypocritical democratic system of capitalist countries and the fascist dictatorship of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, by comparing the changes in living conditions before and after liberation, and by comparing the changes in the national situation and international status before and after liberation, we can easily draw the truth. The truth tells us Chinese people: although we have gone through a century of bloodshed, heroic struggle, and unyielding revolutionary struggle, it is only under the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party of China that we have achieved a thorough victory. This victory is the fruit of the leadership of the working class based on the alliance of workers and peasants, the People's Republic of China, in which the people have all the power, and this power is now clearly stipulated in our constitution. This historical fact makes the people truly believe that what Chairman Mao said is true: "True constitutionalism is not easily obtained, it must be obtained through arduous struggle." Since the fruits of the revolution are so hard to come by, the people can and should know that only the most hard-won things are the most precious and most worthy of protection.

The constitution unifies the will of the people of the whole country, unites the strength of the people of the whole country, corrects the standards of life of the people of the whole country, and makes the steps of the people of the whole country towards socialism more orderly. The people of the whole country will, under the guidance of the constitution, gradually transition to a socialist society through a peaceful path.

This people's constitution is the guarantee of the happiness of the people of our country. The constitution guarantees the leadership of the working class, leading the people of the whole country to strive to carry out socialist industrialization. The constitution guarantees that the peasants and handicraftsmen of the whole country, under the leadership of the working class, will organize and produce, and gradually transition to a socialist society through the path of cooperative transformation. The constitution guarantees that capitalists, as long as they understand the trend of the times, are willing to accept socialist transformation, do not violate the law, and do not sabotage the property of the people, will be taken care of by the state, and their future life and work will be properly arranged, and their political rights will not be deprived. Intellectuals who belong to the people are a precious asset of our country. They should, under the guidance of the constitution, strive to carry out ideological transformation and participate in the construction of socialism, and play the role of knowledge on various fronts and various posts.

The constitution especially inspires our great pioneers of the motherland, that is, the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people—the People's Liberation Army, the Chinese People's Volunteers, and all the people's armed forces. They are the people's army organized, led, and commanded by the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, and they have fought a revolutionary war without precedent in history for thirty years against enemies whose strength is dozens of times greater than ours and who have the help of many imperialists. They have defeated the rule of the Kuomintang, led by Chiang Kai-shek, which was a combination of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, they have swept away all the remnants of counter-revolutionaries on the land of the motherland, and they have smashed the conspiracy of the American aggression group to invade our Northeast. The Chinese people's armed forces have also bravely fought the great anti-American aid to Korea campaign, defended the border of the motherland, and paved the way for the construction of the motherland. They have experienced the hardships of the war period and also received the love and glory given by the victorious people. Today, the people of our country are united in heart and mind, steadily advancing towards the broad road of socialism, but we still face the ferocious American imperialism. It occupies our Taiwan and is actively arming the Chiang Kai-shek traitor clique, trying to conspire to restore power in our country; it is also unwilling to accept the failure of the Geneva Conference and has recently formed a "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization" military alliance, preparing to expand its aggression against our country and the people of Asia. Under this situation, the security of our motherland and the construction of socialism are still seriously threatened. However, we have reason to believe that the people's armed forces, who have been tempered in politics and the military, will definitely be able to overcome the weaknesses that currently exist within themselves, and complete the glorious task of defending the fruits of the people's revolution and national construction, defending the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and security of the state, as stipulated in Article 20 and Article 103 of the draft constitution. The people's armed forces must complete their mission, liberate Taiwan, eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitor clique, and complete the complete unification of the motherland. They must resolutely implement the compulsory military service system stipulated in the constitution and strive to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet army to build a modern national defense army.

Undoubtedly, the formal adoption and implementation of the constitution will arouse the high patriotic enthusiasm of the people of the whole country and the people's army. The outstanding sons and daughters of China, for our great motherland, will be more determined and more courageous to contribute all their strength.

I participated in the first session of the first National People's Congress with a reverent heart, listened to Chairman Mao's opening speech, listened to Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft constitution and the speeches of the representatives, and deeply realized the great significance of the constitution. The tasks entrusted to us by the constitution are particularly great. As a representative of the National People's Congress, as a state organ worker, as a member of the Communist Party of China, we should always remember what Chairman Mao instructed in the opening speech: "We should work hard, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, be honest and diligent, help each other, and beware of any boasting and arrogance..." We should work hard and learn in our own positions, always discover and correct the shortcomings and mistakes in our work, and at least be a servant of the people who is not considered bad by the people. Finally, let me repeat a call from Chairman Mao in the opening speech: "All six hundred million people in China unite and strive for our common cause!" Long live the great motherland!

**Speech by Liu Wenhui**

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, and I have no doubt that I advocate the adoption of this draft constitution.

I personally feel particularly close to the instructions in the preamble of the draft constitution about the role of the united front. In the old China, I was a power-holder of the reactionary ruling class for decades. Although I have opposed the traitor Chiang Kai-shek for many years, this is only an internal contradiction within the reactionary ruling class, and opposing Chiang does not mean revolution. When the Southwest was liberated, I responded to the call of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao and decided to rebel, thus taking the path of the people. However, at that time, my understanding of the united front policy of the Party was still quite vague. I remember that a high-ranking comrade of the Party told someone to tell me: "Mr. So-and-so, this rebellion is truly a good deed for the people." I felt very uncomfortable at that time, but after long-term study and various political movements and social reform movements, I gradually clearly realized my past mistakes. In the past five years, under the leadership of the Party, I have been studying and tempering myself continuously, and have made some progress. This time, I am very honored to be elected as a representative of the National People's Congress, and I have received another deep education from the masses in the election process. The actual life of the past few years has made me deeply feel that the united front policy of the Party is correct and great.

However, on the other hand, based on my observations in the Southwest, there are also shortcomings in the specific implementation of the united front policy. For example, there is a lack of timely criticism and education for the shortcomings and mistakes of members within the united front. I hope that in the future, as soon as someone makes a mistake, timely criticism and education should be given to help them correct it, so that a small mistake does not develop into a big mistake. In addition, some local government officials, when executing various specific tasks, have the attitude of striving to complete the task with surplus value, which is of course good; but some cadres take a one-sided view to strive for "surplus value," which is a bad thing. We must deeply understand the actual ability of the bearers. If we only emphasize the task one-sidedly, without asking about the specific situation, and then give a "surplus value," while the bearers cannot actually bear it, even if the task is forced to be completed, there will be political losses, and the masses will have dissatisfaction, which will affect the unity between the government and the people.

The preamble of the draft constitution says: "In the future, in mobilizing and uniting the people of the whole country to complete the general tasks of the transitional period of the state and the struggle against internal and external enemies, the people's democratic united front of our country will continue to play its role." From this, it can be seen that the tasks of our united front in the future are still enormous. In addition to hoping that the shortcomings in the specific implementation of the united front can be overcome, the main problem is still the self-transformation of the members within the united front. As a rebel soldier, I should make every effort to actively play the role of the united front and unite all possible people; and I should also strengthen my self-transformation and make progress in my ideological understanding. I deeply feel that people like me, who have lived in the old society for decades, have old ideological consciousness that is not easy to change. After liberation, I have undergone long-term study, and I thought that my ideology had been transformed and improved; but when it came to land reform and the "Three Anti" and "Five Anti" movements, my family, relatives, friends, and former subordinates complained to me, and my thoughts became confused, and I unconsciously sympathized with these people. Therefore, I decided to carry out further ideological transformation and improvement. I think that people like me, if they can achieve thorough ideological transformation and gradually arm themselves with socialist ideology, then our united front will be able to play a greater role in completing the general tasks of the transitional period of the state and the struggle against internal and external enemies.

In the future, I will, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, and under the education and supervision of the masses, study hard, work hard, strengthen my self-transformation, and fulfill the responsibilities of a people's representative, better play the role of the united front, ensure the implementation of the constitution, and make our country advance towards a prosperous and happy socialist society!

**Speech by Ding Ling**

When I walked into the venue, when I stood up to speak, I felt my heart trembling, and I was uncontrollably excited. I want to tell everyone, tell the whole world, my feelings that are deeper than mountains and deeper than oceans. This is the bitterness of so many years, the blood and tears of so many years, the result of the sacrifice of so many revolutionaries! Many familiar faces appeared in my mind, and many familiar voices echoed in my ears. I saw peasants, tears on their smiling faces, saying heavily: "I have been a cow and horse for decades, and now I have become a 'person'." Workers clenched their fists and said: "We are no longer stinking workers, and we will no longer hear the boss say: 'I can let you live, and I can let you die.' We are now the masters of China." Old ladies told me: "After overthrowing the landlords, I turned over a new leaf, and after men and women became equal, I turned over another new leaf, and now I just need to learn culture to turn over the third new leaf." There are also old men with white beards. They live in a rest home and say: "How strange! Happiness that we couldn't think of, couldn't dare to think of, has all come true. Every night, I sleep comfortably, but I wake up laughing from my dreams." I saw young people, full of joy, singing "We want to race with time," talking about how to reform technology, increase production and quality, and overfulfill the state plan. They are full of confidence in labor creation. I heard the oath of the soldiers guarding the distant border of the motherland, they wholeheartedly defend us, defend the construction of the motherland, and defend the "peace" that the people of the world demand. The brothers and sisters of the ethnic minorities also sing endlessly: "The stars in the sky are bright, the constitution is remembered in the heart, all nationalities are equal, and we are united into a big family..." I saw an old woman from the Miao ethnic group in Xiangxi, who was willing to bear the main labor of the family and sent her only son to the ethnic middle school to study, and she said to me: "To be the master of the house, can you do without culture?" The young actor Shan Qing of the Chinese Children's Art Troupe wrote the most moving poem, saying: "...I began to read those books without pictures, I began to imagine a beautiful picture, in this picture, we poor children wear new clothes, in this picture, our smiling mother sits beside us, finally a great man made me see it, but it is not a picture on paper, it is a thousand times, a hundred times more beautiful than what I imagined, it is the country we are building..." This poem speaks for many mothers and children, for millions of people. All these cheers, praises, and firm oaths are for one thing, for the birth of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. This is the people's constitution, it gives people dignity, gives people a moral standard, gives people strength, gives people a sublime feeling, people are enriched, armed, and elevated here, people know why to struggle. The constitution is the fruit of struggle, but it does not mean the end of struggle. Our struggle to seek a new life and oppose the old life is never-ending. Just a short time ago, I remember, in Huangshan, Anhui, there was an old man who had been in contact with cliffs, deep mountains, and wild forests for more than thirty years, and his teeth had all fallen out. He told me: "The Communist Party is good, Chairman Mao is good, the government is good, everyone in the village is living well, but there is still a bad cadre in our village, who is a running dog of the landlords, sneaked into the Communist Party, he does not allow me to demolish my own house, he oppresses the people, his surplus grain is more than anyone else's, but he sells very little to the state." Also recently, in a village in Hebei Province, an old acquaintance of mine gave me a letter he had written for years but dared not send, saying: "Why is the bandit who killed my brother still strutting in the village?" Comrades! Such sad things still happen in our country, we must frankly admit. Everyone has rights, and everyone has duties. I am an ordinary writer, and I am the same as everyone else, and we all have the sacred responsibility. We support our constitution, we must abide by it, propagate it, and wage a resolute struggle against what the constitution does not allow. Let us all, for our country, for our people, for the realization of our constitution, contribute all our strength! Long live the people's constitution! Long live the leader of the Chinese people—the Communist Party, Chairman Mao!

**Speech by Xu Simin**

As a representative of the overseas Chinese in Myanmar, I wholeheartedly and enthusiastically support the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft constitution.

Since the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China was published in overseas newspapers, it has caused great joy and excitement among the broad overseas Chinese. Especially, the draft constitution clearly stipulates that "The People's Republic of China protects the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese." Every word of this article is deeply engraved in the hearts of the broad overseas Chinese.

Our motherland has carried out a series of unprecedented construction projects in the past few years and achieved brilliant results. All these precious achievements have improved the international status of the motherland, making overseas Chinese love the motherland even more. Therefore, since liberation, tens of thousands of overseas Chinese have returned to the embrace of their motherland. Among them, some returned because they could not live in their current place; some returned to participate in the great construction of the motherland out of love for the motherland; some returned to receive the advanced culture and skills of the motherland. After returning to the motherland, they all eagerly hope to realize their wishes.

The overseas Chinese representative group suggested adding "providing appropriate assistance and settlement for returning overseas Chinese" to Article 98 when discussing the draft constitution. I proposed this opinion because I saw that these overseas Chinese who had just returned to the motherland, whether they were overseas Chinese who returned to work or overseas Chinese students who returned to study, had lived in a capitalist society for a long time, and their thoughts and living habits were different from those of their compatriots in the country, so we could not require them to be the same as their compatriots in the country as soon as they returned to the motherland, which is very natural. The compatriots in the country, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, have received education from various social reform movements, and their ideological consciousness has been greatly improved, while the overseas Chinese who have just returned from abroad have just returned from different societies to the motherland, and their thoughts and lives are influenced by the society abroad, so when they return to the embrace of the motherland, they face many new things and have difficulties in keeping up with many practical problems, which must be taken into account. My opinion aroused heated discussions. Everyone thought this was a specific work problem, and overseas Chinese returning to the motherland are also citizens of the motherland, and they have the same rights as domestic citizens, so there is no need to specify it in detail in Article 98 of the draft constitution. I agreed with everyone's opinion. But I hope and require local overseas affairs agencies and relevant departments to pay more attention to and care for the situation of overseas Chinese and overseas Chinese youth and students who have just returned to the motherland in terms of ideology, understanding, and habits, and to strengthen their ideological education more patiently, and to provide appropriate assistance and settlement in terms of investment, employment, and education, gradually improve them, educate them patiently, and unite them warmly, so that they can adapt to the ranks of their brothers in the motherland in a short time, which is completely feasible and must be done.

When discussing the draft organizational law of local people's congresses and local people's committees, it also aroused very heated discussions. Everyone thought that in counties and non-district cities with many overseas affairs, it was necessary to set up institutions to manage overseas affairs, because counties and cities are the grassroots institutions to implement overseas affairs policies, and in some places, the overseas affairs policies stipulated by the higher authorities were not well implemented, and some deviations appeared. In recent years, the care of the central people's government for returning overseas Chinese can be said to be meticulous, and there have been great achievements in overseas affairs work. These achievements can be said to be unprecedented in the history of overseas Chinese relations with the motherland. However, today we should not be complacent because of past achievements. We not only require the institutions responsible for overseas affairs work and other state administrative institutions to pay attention to overseas affairs work, but we also require the grassroots party and government responsible institutions and responsible comrades in areas with many overseas affairs to pay more attention to overseas affairs work and seriously implement the overseas affairs policies stipulated by the central people's government. We require that on the basis of past achievements, we should push overseas affairs work forward another step, so that the broad overseas Chinese will love the motherland even more and unite more closely around the motherland.

**Speech by Zhao Zhongyao**

The people of the whole country are welcoming the birth of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China with unprecedented enthusiasm. This constitution is the fruit of the struggle of the people of our motherland for more than a hundred years. What is particularly worth celebrating is that it not only contains the basic human rights that the people of the whole country have long desired, but also contains the guarantee for us to transition to a happy socialist society. This is one of the most advanced constitutions in the world. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, only after liberation, can such a constitution be produced in China.

Since liberation, the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have completed a series of great social reforms according to the provisions of the Common Program. These victories in social reform have prepared the necessary conditions for planned economic construction and the gradual transition to a socialist society. Therefore, at present, we can have a more complete and progressive constitution than the Common Program. This draft constitution has undergone the study and discussion of the people of the whole country. Everyone not only understands its specific articles, but also further understands its basic spirit. Undoubtedly, after this constitution is formally adopted, the people of the whole country will definitely be able to observe it well and, according to its spirit, play a greater role in the construction of socialism.

In recent years, cadres of state organs at all levels and workers in various fields have, through continuous learning and progress, been able to follow the spirit of the people's democratic system to closely contact the masses and serve the people with all their might. However, there are still a few leading cadres and workers who, because they have little contact with the masses or because they are arrogant and complacent, cannot listen to the opinions of the masses and accept the supervision of the masses, and thus make various mistakes of different sizes. As cadres of state organs, we must especially understand the spirit of Article 17 of the draft constitution, use the weapons of criticism and self-criticism, absorb the wisdom of the masses as much as possible, improve the enthusiasm of the masses, and give full play to the maximum effectiveness of democratic centralism.

The establishment of a socialist society is inseparable from the development of science. In Article 95 of the draft constitution, it is stipulated that the state guarantees the freedom of scientific research, and for citizens who engage in scientific work, their creative work is encouraged and helped. Our constitution not only attaches importance to scientific work but also attaches importance to the freedom of scientific research. Scientists across the country are particularly excited about this article. Undoubtedly, this article will also guarantee that scientists in our country will give full play to their enthusiasm to discover scientific truths, apply the results of scientific research, and continuously improve the material and cultural life of the people of our country.

The construction of socialism is a great and arduous task. In the process of advancing, a slight carelessness will lead to detours. Our constitution stipulates the direction and path of socialist construction. Every word and sentence of it guides us in life and work. Because the completion of this constitution is based on the laws of historical development, based on the actual situation in China, and drawing on the advanced experience of fraternal countries, and absorbing the wisdom of tens of millions of people, it will guarantee that we will take the most appropriate path and enter a socialist society at the fastest speed. It will guarantee that we will take the most appropriate steps to promote world peace and human progress.

**Speech by Zhao Maochun**

I fully agree with and support the draft constitution and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft constitution. Here, I would like to speak in two capacities. One is as a representative of the National People's Congress, and the other is as a soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. My comrades and I—the entire leadership and combat personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army—are welcoming the convening of the first session of the first National People's Congress and the birth of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China with boundless love for the motherland. We feel that the blood we shed on the front of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea has not been shed in vain, and everything precious that we have defended is now reflected in the constitution. Is there anything more exciting and inspiring than this!

We, representatives from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, have been entrusted with a particularly important mission. The great motherland has entrusted the task of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to our entire army, and now the entire army has entrusted the will to be loyal to the motherland to us to bring to the congress. We are all executing the motherland's orders: to unite closely with the people and army of Korea, to resolutely observe the Korean Armistice Agreement, to prevent any provocations and sabotage activities by the enemy, and at the same time to help the Korean people rebuild their homes that have been destroyed. We clearly understand that the Korean issue has not been peacefully resolved, and the U.S. imperialists and the Li Cheng-yuan clique are still engaged in activities to sabotage the Korean Armistice Agreement. They have always kept the Korean armistice in an unstable state and have always used this unstable state to continue to create international tension. We fully understand that under this situation, our responsibility is: not to relax, not to be complacent, and to always loyally execute the will of the people of the motherland.

Forever loyal to the motherland is the oath of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. We see in the draft constitution that is about to be adopted by this congress the bright and great future of our motherland. The constitution clearly stipulates that our motherland will eliminate exploitation and poverty through a peaceful path and build a prosperous and happy socialist society. And to build a prosperous and happy socialist society, the constitution also clearly stipulates the foreign policy of serving the lofty purpose of world peace and human progress. This fully reflects the desire of the people of our country for peace and the will to struggle for the cause of peace. The oath of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to the great motherland is: to follow the desire of the people of the motherland for peace, to execute the will of the people of the motherland to struggle for the cause of peace, to guarantee that the people of the motherland can enjoy the benefits of peace on the road to building socialism.

The rapidly changing face of our great motherland inspires us, and now the National People's Congress and the constitution have inspired us with new strength and confidence. We, the entire leadership and combat personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, are determined to work together with the people of the whole country to contribute all our strength to the socialist cause of the motherland. We will, like the special-grade hero Huang Jiguang, who said in his will, "For the motherland, we can give up everything!" We will, like the labor brothers who have shown heroic spirit on the labor front, maintain a high level of vigilance on our own posts, guard against the enemy closely, and be ready to crush any provocation and sabotage by the enemy at any time, struggle for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and struggle to guarantee the socialist construction and socialist transformation of the motherland!

**Speech by Wang Huzhen**

From the day of the great victory of the people's revolution in 1949 to now, it has only been a short five years, but our country has made remarkable progress in all aspects and has changed the entire national situation. There is no doubt that this is the result of removing all political, economic, and cultural shackles from us, allowing the potential of the 600 million people of the whole country to develop freely, thus creating a new situation that has never been seen in any era in history. This should be attributed to the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China, the people's government, and Chairman Mao, and the efforts of the broad masses of the people.

Taking my personal experience as an example: I am a water conservancy worker. From the day I entered university, I prepared to dedicate my life to the construction of water conservancy projects for the country. However, after graduation, I experienced the periods of warlord warfare and Kuomintang rule, and wasted half a century of my life without completing any actual work. Although I had worked hard to complete the plans for several water conservancy projects, they were only for people to talk about for a while and were soon all shelved. In the old society, the ruling class did not care about the interests of the masses, so water conservancy workers, like other scientific and technological workers, encountered obstacles everywhere and found no way out.

After liberation, the situation has fundamentally changed. In the past five years, the water conservancy projects completed by our country have far exceeded any period in history. The Huai River treatment project, which has been talked about for a hundred years, the Yongding River treatment project, which has been planned for more than thirty years, and the hydropower industry that people have dreamed of for a lifetime, are no longer dreams but have become realities. On the land of our country, people have built large and small reservoirs and sluices with their own hands, repaired countless rivers and dikes. Relying on these projects, not only has agricultural production been guaranteed to a certain extent for many years, but also in this summer, the great flood that broke the record of a hundred years was successfully repelled, reducing the losses caused by the flood to the people. These achievements are unimaginable in the old society where the productive forces have not been liberated. I, who have wasted half a century, also have the opportunity to participate in the hot and heavy construction, participate in the Huai River treatment project, and recently complete the arch dam of the Foziling Reservoir. I am full of new hope and new strength, and I am willing to work with water conservancy workers across the country to do more for the people. I have also realized that only under the people's democratic system, where the people are the masters, can scientific and technological research receive encouragement and help from the state. Therefore, I am determined to use all my strength to support this people's democratic constitution and strive for its implementation.

**Speech by Gu Jiumu**

I wholeheartedly support the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report, and I am determined to strive for its implementation.

Since liberation, the Yi people of Xikang have enjoyed the rights of national equality in the family of the motherland, and have become the masters of the state. Under the leadership of the people's government and with the support and help of the advanced Han brothers, the various constructions in the Yi areas have made some progress, increased iron agricultural tools, and partially changed the backward state of "slash-and-burn agriculture." Agricultural production has increased by more than 20% compared to before liberation. The Yi people can now wear cloth clothes and eat salt, and the mortality rate has been greatly reduced, and children can go to school. In the past few years, we have deeply experienced that the Yi people can only progress and follow the progress of the motherland to a happier life by uniting in the family of the unified motherland, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and with the help of the Han nationality.

The Yi nationality is still backward compared to other nationalities in our motherland, so we must further consolidate the unity between nationalities and within nationalities, strive for progress, and work harder to catch up with the advanced nationalities and gradually transition to a socialist society.

Now there are still some counter-revolutionaries lurking in the Yi areas, and they are trying to use various conspiratorial means to sabotage national unity, disrupt social order, and damage the various constructions of the motherland in the Yi areas. These counter-revolutionaries must be thoroughly eliminated, and the work in the Yi areas can only move forward.

There are still many backward and unreasonable phenomena within the Yi nationality, which are also obstacles to the development of the Yi people, and these must be gradually changed. The Yi people should sincerely learn from the advanced areas and nationalities.

In the development of various undertakings, there are many difficulties that the Yi people themselves cannot overcome, such as cadres, finance, technology, etc., all need the care and support of the state; all need the help of advanced areas and the Han people. In the past few years, our work in various aspects has achieved some results, which is precisely because we have received help and support. However, from the needs, the cadres sent to the Yi areas are still few, and there is not even one road. This has a great impact on the progress of the work in the Yi areas and needs to be gradually solved. The cadres of the Han nationality working in the Yi areas are very hardworking and diligent, and the Yi people are very grateful to them and regard them as family. Only a few individuals still cannot stand the backward state of the Yi nationality, and are impatient or unwilling to work in the Yi areas. There are difficulties on our road to progress, but we believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, we can overcome them, and we have full confidence to gradually build the Yi areas like other areas of the motherland.

**Speech by Gao Chongmin**

I fully support the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China and fully agree with Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China.

The Constitution of the People's Republic of China, which is about to be adopted, is the constitution for building a socialist society in our country. Strictly observing and resolutely implementing this constitution is an important guarantee for our country to smoothly build a socialist society.

In order to follow the path stipulated by the constitution to make our country transition to a socialist society, the people of the whole country must, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and Chairman Mao, further strengthen unity, further consolidate and strengthen the people's democratic united front. Undoubtedly, the people's democratic united front in our country has played a great role and achieved great results in democratic revolution and all social reforms in the country. The people's democratic united front in China, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, is becoming more and more consolidated and expanded, and there is unity between various nationalities, various democratic classes, and various democratic parties and people's organizations. However, we can also see that some organs have shortcomings in the specific implementation of the united front policy. These shortcomings are reflected in the fact that democracy is not fully developed, such as some organs do not consult with people from all sides enough when handling and solving some important problems; and some comrades do not listen to and respect the opinions of the masses enough. Another reflection is that the help and education for some democratic personages are not enough, such as some comrades do not criticize and educate their shortcomings and mistakes in a timely and specific manner, but adopt negative attitudes such as indulgence and evasion. In this way, the goal of uniting, educating, and transforming them cannot be achieved. The main reason for these shortcomings is that these comrades do not have a sufficient understanding of the united front policy. Therefore, I think that in the future, we should further strengthen the education of the united front policy, improve the understanding of the united front policy, and appropriately carry out criticism and self-criticism, so that the representatives of all sides and the masses can be more closely united around the Communist Party of China and the government.

I believe that no matter who wants to play a certain role in the construction of the country, he must sincerely accept the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the people's government. From the perspective of the local organization of the Democratic Alliance in Northeast China, there are still some comrades among the members who have not yet reached the stage of speaking without reservation and speaking without reservation about the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the people's government; they do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of unity and progress, lack the concept of the whole country, and nurture the emotions of arrogance and complacency, and do not humbly learn. Therefore, in the past few years, we should have done a good job, but some have not been done well. These phenomena are inconsistent with the spirit of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, and in the future, we must resolutely overcome them.

I firmly believe that the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China will be adopted at this session of the first National People's Congress, and the people of the whole country will definitely guarantee its implementation with actual actions. I also firmly believe that under the great light of the constitution, the shortcomings and mistakes that exist in various aspects will be quickly corrected. The people of the whole country will definitely be more closely united, carry forward the spirit of high patriotism and hard work, follow the path stipulated by the constitution of our country, and strive to build a socialist society! Strive to liberate Taiwan victoriously!

Finally, I propose that this meeting formally adopts the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China.

**Speech by Xirong Jia Cuo**

The people's constitution is the ideal that the people of the whole country have longed for for more than a hundred years, and today it has become a reality under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. We express our enthusiastic support and strive for its thorough implementation.

The draft constitution stipulates in Article 3 the policy of national equality and unity, and based on this policy, it stipulates that the autonomous organs of national autonomous areas manage the finances of the local area, organize the local public security forces, formulate autonomous regulations and separate regulations, and use one or several languages commonly used in the local area to perform their duties. At the same time, the preamble points out: "The state will take into account the needs of various nationalities in the process of economic construction and cultural construction, and in the issue of socialist transformation, it will fully pay attention to the characteristics of the development of various nationalities." It fully guarantees the equal rights of ethnic minorities. Qinghai is a multi-ethnic region. In the past five years, due to the implementation of regional ethnic autonomy, the unity of various ethnic groups has been widely strengthened, ethnic disputes have been mediated, ethnic barriers have been basically eliminated, remnant bandits have been wiped out, the incidence of human and animal diseases has been greatly reduced, and the economy and culture of agricultural and pastoral areas have been steadily developed, thus changing the situation of poverty and backwardness, and a new situation of "peaceful grasslands and prosperous people and livestock" has emerged. However, there are still shortcomings. Due to excessive leniency, some individuals with bad qualities deceive the government, neglect the law, and make law-abiding people heartbroken. In the unified purchase and sale, there have been cases of compulsory orders, which have caused doubts about the government's policies on religion and customs, and in the future, efforts must be made to overcome these shortcomings.

The draft constitution stipulates in Article 88 that citizens of the People's Republic of China have the freedom of religious belief. The facts have proved: New China has fully implemented the policy of freedom of religious belief, such as protecting temples and patriotic figures in the religious community, and almsgiving and begging are completely voluntary. The Chinese Buddhist Association has been established, uniting Buddhist believers of various nationalities, regardless of sects, progressing together. The political status of Buddhist believers has been improved, such as six of the nine representatives of the National People's Congress elected in Qinghai Province are ethnic minorities, and six of the chairpersons and vice-chairpersons of six autonomous prefectures are mostly believers in religion. The most important thing is: after the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni ended the long history of disunity and became closely united like milk and water, making Tibet, where Buddhism is prevalent, return to the family of the motherland. Now the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni are attending the first session of the first National People's Congress together, opening a new treasure of harmony and happiness for the Han-Tibetan ethnic groups and within Tibet, and thus bringing continuous progress in thought and action to the people who believe in religion. Chairman Mao's instructions to the Tibet delegation on the Communist Party's protection of religious freedom are in complete agreement with the facts of protecting religious freedom, which shows that the protection of citizens' religious freedom is a firm and unshakable policy.

In the past, the Kuomintang's constitution-making gold signboard, which was used to deceive people, was used to deceive people, and it had no intention of practicing it, while today's constitution is a constitution of true gold that can withstand fire, breakage, and grinding. Now the traitor Chiang Kai-shek is still occupying our territory of Taiwan and is spreading more and more rumors to sabotage national unity and religion, so we must continue to strengthen patriotic education, consolidate the unity between nationalities, and be vigilant, and strive tirelessly to liberate Taiwan and build a great family of socialist motherland!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the Communist Party of China!

Long live the great unity of all nationalities in China!

Long live the great leader of all ethnic groups in China, Chairman Mao!

**Speech by Yuan Xuefen**

I am an actress, and I feel very honored to stand on this solemn podium.

In my short life, I have experienced all the bitterness and sorrow that the old society has given me. In my not too long acting career, I have also played many women who were oppressed by the old society. I am not necessarily familiar with their lives and struggles, but because of my own experience, I seem to be able to understand the spirit of Chinese women who have longed for freedom and sought liberation for thousands of years. I have played ancient legendary women such as Zhu Yingtai and Bai Suzhen, and I have also played Xianglin Sao in the revolutionary period of the Xinhai Revolution. The oppression and suffering they endured are almost the same as our own experiences before liberation. In fact, in some aspects, the oppression and suffering we have experienced may be even heavier. Because in the old society, I was a despised "actress."

I do not want to talk about the bitterness of an "actress" in the old society here. On this, our sisters have already said a lot in the past five years. I just want to mention that not long ago, I listened to the report on the draft constitution and participated in the discussion on the draft constitution. While looking forward to an infinitely beautiful future, I could not help but recall the painful past. During the Kuomintang's rule, we could not even perform a play with a little bit of people's spirit without being persecuted, without being despised, and without the danger of being beaten and imprisoned; while today, the draft constitution stipulates: "The People's Republic of China guarantees the freedom of citizens to engage in scientific research, literary and artistic creation, and other cultural activities. The state encourages and helps the creative work of citizens engaged in science, education, literature, art, and other cultural undertakings." These words are more affectionate to us, who have experienced double and triple oppression, than a mother's love! I cannot help but thank the Communist Party, without the Communist Party, there would not be such a constitution!

I feel that this constitution is a guarantee of the happy life of the Chinese people, and this constitution is also a guarantee of the prosperity of Chinese literature and art.

Since liberation, the state has given great encouragement, care, and help to our opera industry, and under the leadership of the Party and the government, we have done some work. However, from the objective requirements, from the expectations of the people, it is undeniable that our work is far from enough. The Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have already successfully completed the people's democratic revolution and have already successfully entered the period of socialist transformation, that is, the transitional period of the socialist revolution. However, our opera work, whether in the ideological and artistic level of the script, in the performance method, in the system of the troupe, in the attitude of life and art of the actors, is still stuck in the previous stage. We have not established a clear socialist ideology, we have not well implemented the policy of serving socialist construction, and in art, we also have many conservative ideas, and we rarely break through the old forms and systems to try to perform modern themes. Taking our Yue opera work as an example, there are still phenomena of self-conceit and lack of progress in some people, and in this way, our work will have the danger of falling behind the new life and falling behind the people's requirements day by day. Representatives, on the one hand, we feel honored for the encouragement and support of the state, on the other hand, we also feel the great responsibility. Because our Yue opera is still a young genre, we have the determination to reform, so I can promise here to everyone that I will work with all progressive opera workers to realize socialism, and to create new content and new forms of national opera art with all my strength.

**Speech by Chen Shutang**

After the Central People's Government published the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, the people of the whole country were excited to welcome the fact that their country would have a true democratic constitution. Especially for us who have struggled for decades under the reactionary rule in the past, we have longed for democratic constitutionalism but have not been able to obtain it. Now, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, we have achieved revolutionary victory, and since the founding of the People's Republic of China, we have achieved many new victories in just five years. Now, the symbol of this revolutionary victory, the constitution that conforms to the wishes of the people of the whole country, is about to be born. I am here with a heart full of joy to express my greatest respect to the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, who led the Chinese people to victory.

When we discussed the draft constitution in Guangdong Province, people from all walks of life were very satisfied with this draft constitution. Everyone thought that this draft constitution was based on the interests of the people of the whole country and was the most powerful weapon for uniting the people of all nationalities and all classes in the country.

The common aspiration of the Chinese people is to build our motherland into a prosperous and strong, peaceful and happy socialist country, and the implementation of this draft constitution will definitely be able to smoothly realize the common aspiration of the Chinese people.

Therefore, I wholeheartedly support this draft constitution and hope that the National People's Congress will unanimously adopt it. At the same time, I fully agree with and support Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft constitution.

I am a people's representative, and I will definitely be loyal to the people's democratic system, observe the constitution and laws, and strive to serve the people. I will also set an example in my work and social activities I participate in, and guarantee the implementation of the constitution, laws, and state policies.

I am also a member of a democratic party, and I will do my best to consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front led by the Communist Party of China, so that the people's democratic united front can continue to play its role in national life. But it is undeniable that, in the case of Guangdong, there have indeed been some places where the united front policy has not been well implemented in the past, which has seriously reflected the rough work style and dragging attitude of the leading cadres of the relevant departments, lacking the spirit of seeking truth from facts and lacking responsibility, thus causing adverse effects in the work of the united front. Although these shortcomings have been gradually overcome, they are still worthy of our serious attention. In the future, we must make everyone follow the principles and spirit of the constitution, pay more attention to the work of the united front, and better play the role of the united front, for mobilizing and uniting the people of the whole country to complete the general tasks of the state in the transitional period and to oppose internal and external enemies, and for maintaining the integrity of the territory and liberating Taiwan, we will strive unremittingly.

**Speech by Ding Zhihui**

I feel very honored to be elected as a representative of the National People's Congress this time, but I also feel very ashamed because I have contributed little to the motherland and the people, and the tasks entrusted to me by the state and the people have not been well completed. This election is another encouragement from the state and the people to me. I will be more humble, more sincere, and more active in my work and study, and use my actual actions to repay the people's trust and expectations.

Our country's epoch-making constitution is about to be promulgated and implemented nationwide. I express my heartfelt support and will resolutely implement it in the future. This constitution has undergone repeated discussions by the people of the whole country and unanimously believes that this constitution, personally led by the great people's leader Chairman Mao, is drafted from the interests of the people. This constitution reflects the actual situation of the People's Republic of China since its founding, summarizes the main experience of the people's revolutionary struggle in legislative form, affirms the great achievements of the people's revolution, and affirms the common purpose and desire of the people of the People's Republic of China to gradually build a socialist society. In the future, the implementation of this constitution will guarantee that we gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the state, gradually complete the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, that is, it will guarantee that our motherland will be built into a prosperous and happy socialist society. In the near future, our country will be as strong and prosperous as today's Soviet Union, and our people will be as happy as today's Soviet people.

Our Party and state have always been concerned about the health of the working people. The draft constitution stipulates in Articles 92 and 93 that "workers have the right to rest," and "workers, when they are old, sick, or lose their ability to work, have the right to material assistance. The state establishes social insurance, social relief, and public health undertakings, and gradually expands these facilities to ensure that workers enjoy these rights." I am a health worker and feel particularly excited. In the future, the responsibility of health departments and health workers across the country will be even greater.

Our country has made significant progress in the medical and health sector over the past five years since liberation. We have expanded high-level and mid-level medical and pharmaceutical schools and trained a large number of medical and health personnel. The number of beds in hospitals and sanatoriums nationwide has increased more than fivefold compared to before liberation (excluding industrial medical institutions). In addition to establishing numerous health institutions in minority regions, the state has also regularly dispatched medical and epidemic prevention teams to work in these areas. Initial efforts have been made in maternal and child health, and the infant mortality rate has shown a significant reduction. Since the launch of the patriotic health campaign in 1952, not only have we thwarted the American invaders' plot to destroy humanity with bacteria, but we have also improved the environment and personal hygiene, begun to establish good hygiene habits, and thus started to see a general reduction in diseases. However, we must not be satisfied with these achievements. There are still many shortcomings in the health sector, such as the lack of unified organization and leadership in urban medical institutions, the failure to adopt planned and scientific management methods, and the uneven distribution of medical institutions, leading to uneven medical tasks and the inability to fully utilize the potential of public and private hospitals and traditional and Western medicine. Many private hospitals and traditional practitioners are idle with nothing to do. Additionally, the utilization of experts and professors is still insufficient, with some experts holding five or six positions, spending a lot of time traveling, and having little time to interact with patients. Furthermore, the political education of medical personnel is not deep enough, and some technical personnel still have a hired labor mindset, lacking a genuine attitude of serving the people wholeheartedly. In the future, we should strengthen and improve the leadership and management of medical and health institutions, fully utilize the potential of public and private hospitals and traditional and Western medical institutions, and strengthen the political education of technical personnel to better solve the people's medical problems.

Additionally, we should strengthen industrial health work to ensure the country's industrial production. We should seriously study advanced Soviet medicine and organize and research our country's medicine. We should also improve the quality of maternal and child health work, and the health work of the masses and the army should be regularized and continuously improved to raise the health level of the people. These are the areas we must strive for. The socialist construction of our country urgently requires our health work to continuously improve.

I hope that the national health institutions and all health workers will work diligently and assist each other to complete the glorious tasks assigned by the Constitution.

Li Xuefeng's Speech

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with the entire content of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and fully agree with the report on the Constitution by Comrade Liu Shaoqi. The people of the entire country have enthusiastically participated in the discussion of the Constitution and enthusiastically welcomed the convening of the First Session of the First National People's Congress. This is because this Constitution, based on the people's democratic system, aims to build a socialist society, and concentrates the most vibrant and promising elements from people's lives. It concentrates the most important, most realistic, and most valuable achievements from people's practices over the past few years and now. What the people demand and strive for is socialism, not capitalism; it is the people's democratic system, not the capitalist democratic system. Undoubtedly, our national system and the people's awareness will "ensure that our country can eliminate exploitation and poverty through peaceful means and build a prosperous and happy socialist society."

People's practice is always great and multifaceted, but it is also bound to have shortcomings and errors. Victory in practice is achieved under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, under the actual guidance of the correct policies of the Communist Party of China and our country, through the self-awareness and voluntary efforts of the people to overcome shortcomings and errors, to overcome numerous practical difficulties, and thus achieve success. No work can be imagined to be without shortcomings and errors; it cannot be approached with an attitude of everything being fine. On the contrary, it must be approached with an attitude of seeking truth from facts and self-criticism to deal with one's own work and to educate the people. The system of people's democratic institutions stipulated in the Constitution fully guarantees this.

The Constitution stipulates that our country is a people's democratic country led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants. Over the past five years, the working class, in realizing and strengthening its leadership role, has, like other people, greatly tempered and strengthened itself. Its development was not smooth sailing but involved extensive self-criticism within the class, overcoming bureaucratism in administration and other work, and continuously overcoming various biases, shortcomings, and errors within its ranks, and overcoming organizational and disciplinary laxity to strengthen itself. This has been fully proven in the past democratic reforms and production reforms in factories and mines, in the implementation of national plans, in labor competitions, in the promotion of advanced experiences, and in the implementation of suggestions from Soviet experts. In the future, in the face of the arduous task of implementing socialist industrialization, we must greatly develop this experience to fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the working class to respond to every call of the state and complete all state plans.

In realizing its full leadership role, the working class must first pay attention to consolidating the alliance of workers and peasants. Our country has, over the past few years, reformed the land system, satisfying the peasants' demand for land, and widely mobilized the revolutionary enthusiasm of the peasants. It has also timely developed production cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, and credit cooperatives, implemented planned procurement and supply of grain and other major agricultural products, and mobilized the broad masses of peasants to transform individual farming. Directing this force and enthusiasm of the peasants to the socialist transformation of agriculture in an organized manner is today's main task in leading the peasants. Peasants have weaknesses; along with their socialist demands, there is also a tendency towards spontaneous capitalism. Rich peasants take advantage of this weakness to carry out resistance and sabotage activities. The working class must rely on the peasants, through the self-awareness activities of the peasants, educate the peasants, and overcome the resistance of rich peasants, limit the economy of rich peasants, to gradually realize the socialist transformation of agriculture. This requires all rural workers to adhere to the methods of demonstration and patient persuasion, and oppose bureaucratism and coercive commands.

Bureaucratism and coercive commands often appear and repeat in our state organs and the actual work of many workers, which directly contradicts the spirit of the people's democratic system. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct thorough education for all workers and, according to the entire people's democratic system stipulated in the Constitution, especially the system of people's congresses at all levels, courts, and procuratorates, to guarantee the rights of the people, to fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the people, and to strive for the gradual transition to a socialist society.

Long Yun's Speech

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I am extremely excited to speak at this solemn First Session of the First National People's Congress, feeling greatly honored.

In the five years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, a series of social reforms have been carried out, fundamentally changing the face of old China, eliminating the forces of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism that invaded, oppressed, and exploited us on the mainland. In political, economic, cultural, and military construction, we have achieved remarkable results. Moreover, due to diplomatic victories, our country has gained high prestige and status internationally. It is thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao that we have achieved such results, enabling the country to have the conditions to convene this First National People's Congress to formulate the Constitution.

The draft Constitution has been widely and thoroughly discussed by the people nationwide and is about to be passed at this conference. I fully agree with Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft Constitution. This Constitution consolidates the achievements of the people's revolution, reflects the fundamental requirements of the transitional period of the state, clearly defines the rights and duties of the people, and clearly points out our goals of struggle. This Constitution is the fundamental law of the state, and its essence is superior. We must abide by it and implement it in earnest. I sincerely express my support for it.

The draft Constitution clearly stipulates that ethnic minorities are politically, economically, and culturally equal. I am particularly excited about this. Because Sun Yat-sen, in his lifetime, advocated the equality of all ethnicities, the traitor Chiang Kai-shek not only did not implement this policy but also consistently discriminated against and persecuted ethnic minorities, so Sun's wish could not be realized. Today, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, ethnic minorities have truly gained equal rights. As far as I know, in the past few years, just in terms of the national education funds spent on ethnic minorities each year, it has exceeded the education funds spent nationwide during the reactionary government's time, which is a vivid proof. Moreover, the general principles of the draft Constitution clearly stipulate that ethnic minorities have the right to regional autonomy in places where they are concentrated. I believe that after the Constitution is promulgated, we ethnic minorities will unanimously be elated and wholeheartedly support it.

To make our future work better, we should, in the spirit of the Constitution, examine some shortcomings in past administration. I have a few suggestions for reference. For example: In education, due to the urgent cultural needs of the people, the existing schools and teachers are not enough to meet the needs of national construction. In some areas, there are many students but small school buildings, and both teachers and students face difficulties, which affects students' studies and health. I hope this can be improved. In railway transportation, we have achieved primary success, but currently, passenger traffic is crowded, ticket purchasing is difficult, seat numbers are disordered, and passengers feel inconvenienced. I hope the relevant departments will pay attention to this. In health, the patriotic health campaign has achieved great success, but medical facilities are still insufficient, and patients face difficulties. I hope this can be improved.

We have always been an economically backward country. Although we have recovered and built up in the past few years, healing the wounds of war, and achieved great success, we are still in the midst of the Korean War, Taiwan has not been liberated, and the First Five-Year Plan is in progress. We cannot afford to do everything at once. Construction should weigh priorities and urgency. All expenditures should be streamlined and economical, strictly prohibiting waste. Some non-urgent constructions should be postponed to accumulate funds for the country, invest in production and construction, and ensure the early completion of the Five-Year Plan.

Taiwan is a part of our country's territory. Now, American imperialism and the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique are occupying Taiwan, firmly opposing the Chinese people, frequently harassing and sabotaging our coastal areas, obstructing our peaceful construction, which is unacceptable. For the integrity of our territory and sovereignty, for the security of our country, for the guarantee of peace in Asia and the world, we must eliminate the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique and liberate Taiwan.

Finally, I sincerely wish for the success of this First Session of the First National People's Congress. I hope that the Constitution of the People's Republic of China will be smoothly passed. Let us unite under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao to strive for the construction of a socialist society.

Hu Zhonghua's Speech

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I am honored to represent the Awa people of Yunnan Province to participate in the First Session of the First National People's Congress!

Awa Mountain is located in the southwestern border of our motherland. There are over 400,000 people from the Awa, Dai, and Lisu ethnic groups. Before liberation, the reactionaries would come and demand money, grain, and livestock, and incite ethnic conflicts. Therefore, there was a wall between us and the inland ethnic groups. Han people dared not enter, fearing beheading, and we dared not go out, fearing being killed. Such a large area had no schools, no doctors, production was backward, and diseases were rampant. Those days were very difficult.

After liberation, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao sent cadres who were completely different from the previous Han rulers. They helped us unite, improve production, and brought a large amount of materials, loans, and relief funds. Five schools were established, three hospitals were set up, and roads were built. Thus, production improved, and some places are changing the evil practice of human sacrifice. When sick, they mostly seek doctors for medicine, no longer relying on divination and offerings. Therefore, life is gradually improving. Now, the Awa people hope that the government will send more of Chairman Mao's people, more cadres, doctors, and teachers to help us carry out the work. More Awa people are coming out to attend meetings, visit, and study, and everywhere they receive preferential treatment from the government and welcome from people of all ethnic groups, but we hope the government will send more people out.

In the past, there was a lack of unity among ethnic groups. In the year before liberation, the Awa people even fought with the Sima Dai people for three months, resulting in many casualties. Now, everyone listens to Chairman Mao, and we are united again, working together. In the past, the border was unprotected, but now the People's Liberation Army is stationed there, and we have organized militia to assist the People's Liberation Army in eliminating the remnants of the Kuomintang bandits in Cangyuan, making the border more stable than before. However, we are still threatened by the remnants of the Kuomintang bandits and the sabotage of spies, and the people still have concerns. We hope to liberate Taiwan as soon as possible, completely eliminate the remnants of the Kuomintang bandits, so that the border will be further stabilized, and national defense will be further consolidated. We will strengthen unity, heighten vigilance, assist the People's Liberation Army, and support the People's Liberation Army.

I participated in the discussion of the draft Constitution and now have listened to Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report. I fully support it. The Awa people will resolutely, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, further strengthen ethnic unity, and with the help of advanced ethnic groups, advance towards a socialist society.

Liu Ningyi's Speech

Chairman, fellow representatives:

The convening of the First Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China is a historic event of epoch-making significance. At this conference, we, the representatives, have a solemn and sacred task, which is to solemnly pass the Constitution of the People's Republic of China.

This draft Constitution in front of us, I believe, is completely in line with the will and aspirations of the working class. Because it summarizes the experience of the people's revolutionary struggle, consolidates the achievements of the people's revolutionary victory in legal form; at the same time, it plans a beautiful socialist future for our country. I fully agree with and support the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report.

I firmly believe that the passage of this Constitution will further consolidate and develop our country's people's democratic system.

The trade union organizations of China have always been a strong pillar of our people's democratic government. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, trade union organizations have carried out extensive educational work to attract the broad masses of workers in our country to participate in the recovery and development of the national economy. Hundreds of thousands of male and female workers, technical personnel, and staff have launched labor competitions, making great contributions to the recovery of the national economy. Since 1953, when our country began the First Five-Year Construction Plan, labor competitions have also developed, overcoming some inevitable shortcomings in the initial stage, and moving towards a higher stage, that is, improving technology and innovating technology. Labor competitions are a powerful force, driving our national economy to develop at a relatively fast pace.

With the development of the state's economic construction, the ranks of the working class in our country have become increasingly strong. Now, the vast majority of workers and staff have joined the trade unions. In 1949, the number of trade union members was only 2,373,938, but now it has reached 11 million. The powerful working class is determined to carry out the provisions of the Constitution: gradually eliminate the system of exploitation and build a socialist society.

Under our people's democratic system, laborers receive meticulous care. Based on the continuous growth of the national economy, the material and cultural living standards of the working class are improving. The improvement of the social and political status of the working class in our country and the improvement of their material and cultural living standards vividly demonstrate the superiority of the people's democratic system.

However, there are still some negative factors in some factories and mines, causing unnecessary losses to our work. For example, in some enterprises, there is still a phenomenon of no one being responsible for production management. In basic construction, due to poor management of design and construction, there are phenomena of wasting labor, materials, and materials. Due to poor planning management and financial management in some enterprises, there are widespread and serious phenomena of hoarding funds, hoarding materials, and wasting transportation power. In technical management, due to the lack of proper technical organizational measures, there is a large amount of accumulation of rationalization suggestions from the masses of workers. All these unfavorable situations affect the reduction of production costs, causing huge losses in production, and violating the principles of economy and accounting. It should be pointed out that this, on the one hand, reflects the existence of bureaucratism in the enterprise administration, and on the other hand, reflects that the trade union organization has not well mobilized the masses to play the supervisory role given by the trade union law, and carried out the struggle against bureaucratism. We must take various measures to eliminate these unfavorable factors to improve the management level of factories and mines and accelerate the process of socialist industrialization.

Our Constitution has made clear and specific provisions for the gradual realization of the goal of the state's socialist industrialization. However, we must overcome the shortcomings in specific work to smoothly realize this goal of struggle. The faster the shortcomings in specific work are overcome, the better the work is done, the faster and more thorough the realization of the constitutional goal will be.

The trade union organization will ensure that the Constitution is implemented in actual work.

Lu Longji's Speech

Chairman, fellow representatives:

The draft Constitution proposed by the Central People's Government is very perfect, and I fully support it. Before I vote in favor of this draft Constitution, I would like to say a few words about my personal understanding of the Constitution.

I am a person who has studied constitutional law in Anglo-American countries; I am a person who has taught constitutional law in a university in China; I am a person who has participated in the constitutional movement in old China; I am a person who has been poisoned by the constitutional theories of capitalist countries; and I must frankly admit that I am a person who has poisoned Chinese youth with poisonous constitutional theories. Today's me, in order to represent the Chinese people, must vote in support of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China with a new concept and new understanding.

Comrade Liu Shaoqi mentioned in his report on the draft Constitution that this draft Constitution is a summary of China's modern history of constitutional issues and constitutional movements. I personally hope that at this solemn First National People's Congress, when the Constitution is passed, this is the unanimous declaration of all 600 million people in China, all the representatives, that the bourgeois constitutional theories, the bourgeois constitutional illusions, are completely, thoroughly, and forever ended in China!

Today, China is still a country with classes. Today, the representatives present are still from various different classes. The fact is like this, but when we vote to pass the Constitution, our thoughts can only be, and must be, sincerely supporting a Constitution that transitions from a new democratic society to a socialist society. We must resolutely and without doubt recognize that the only path for China today is to transition from a new democratic society to a socialist society. The people's democratic class alliance in a people's democratic country is a struggle, and it is necessary to carry out socialist transformation. Our Constitution is a Constitution for socialist construction and socialist transformation. After the Constitution is passed, the classes that need to be transformed must sincerely accept the transformation. With such an understanding, we can correctly understand the entire spirit of the Constitution. In this way, our passage of the Constitution will have even greater historical significance.

After the publication of our draft Constitution, magazines in capitalist countries ridicule that the guarantees of citizens' rights in our draft Constitution are not specific and practical, and cannot compare with the actual situation of the Soviet Constitution. Yes, they are right! Our Constitution today cannot compare with the progressive Soviet Constitution. The Soviet Union is already an advanced socialist country. We are just a new democratic country learning from the Soviet Union. We are a country advancing behind the Soviet Union. Universally copying all the good clauses from constitutions around the world and decorating the Constitution into a beautiful article is the trick of the reactionary governments in China to create fake constitutions, and it is the trick of capitalist countries to deceive the people. The constitutions of capitalist countries, formally declare a large number of citizens' rights, writing them all; at the same time, using ordinary legislative procedures to deprive the broad masses of these rights, depriving them endlessly. Today's America is a typical example of this. Recently, the laws passed by the U.S. Congress and promulgated by President Eisenhower declare the American Communist Party illegal. This is a great satire on the "freedom of assembly and association" stipulated in the American Constitution. This is a great satire on the "freedom" of people in the so-called "free world." Their constitutions are: prescribe the right medicine but sell the wrong medicine; hang the head of a sheep but sell the meat of a dog! Our Constitution is: what is said must be done, seek truth from facts, do not exaggerate, do not deceive. This is the characteristic of our Constitution! Our Constitution is a truly democratic Constitution.

The Chinese people are about to have a truly democratic Constitution, which is a great joy. In recent years, the Chinese people have eagerly hoped that the country will formulate a Constitution as soon as possible and formulate all laws based on the Constitution. In the early days of the founding of the country, we overthrew the feudal Six Codes. In terms of time and experience, we could not formulate new laws. We once used government policies as the working guidelines for legal personnel. Some grassroots cadres, because they did not fully understand the policies, inevitably had some deviations when implementing the policies. This is a fact. In recent years, the Central People's Government has formulated some major laws, but there have been some shortcomings and errors in the propaganda, interpretation, and enforcement of the laws. This is a fact. Some high-level leaders not only do not advocate the spirit of law-abiding, but also regard themselves as having a special status above the law. This is also a fact. These years, the wishes of the people have not been fully satisfied, and the spirit of rule of law has not been fully implemented, this shortcoming, we should admit.

The more the country progresses, the more the spirit of rule of law should be raised. We have not paid enough attention to such a concept in the past, and we have not worked hard enough on such work. Therefore, in recent years, there has been a phenomenon of neglecting legal work in society. In the old society, there were too many legal personnel; in the new society, there are too few legal personnel. The state has not done a good job of ideological remolding for the old legal personnel; for the new legal cadres, it has not done a good job of business training. Some old legal personnel are idle and unemployed; new legal cadres are in short supply. In the past, many people wanted to be officials; now, few people want to be officials. Generally, young students, when choosing subjects for enrollment, are very enthusiastic about going to factories; going to government agencies, going to legal agencies is the end of the road. This idea is definitely wrong. Without good legal personnel, without good legal work, the country cannot have good constitutionalism, cannot have true rule of law. The country is about to have a fundamental law! Based on this fundamental law, formulate the laws that the country should have, raise the level of national rule of law, this is the responsibility of the highest state power organ, this is the responsibility of us representatives present. We must, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, fully undertake this responsibility!

Fellow representatives, the 600 million people are eagerly waiting for us to pass the Constitution of the People's Republic of China!

This Constitution meets the current needs of the country!

This Constitution meets the interests of the people of the entire country!

This Constitution meets the aspirations of the people of the entire country!

This Constitution will definitely mobilize the Chinese people, unite the Chinese people, arm the Chinese people, and make the Chinese people advance joyfully, smoothly, and victoriously towards a prosperous and happy socialist society.

Fan Wenlan's Speech

I fully agree with and support the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft Constitution. I suggest that our conference unanimously pass this great Constitution.

The Chinese people have obtained this Constitution after experiencing a very difficult and tortuous journey. For more than a hundred years, the enemies of the Chinese people—imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism—have combined to form a powerful counter-revolutionary force, trying to drag China into the abyss of colonialism. The Chinese people have a long revolutionary tradition and a strong spirit of resistance, and will never allow China to become a colony. Therefore, the Chinese people have launched a fierce and long-term struggle against the counter-revolutionary forces, using the blood of countless heroes to write the history of China's modern revolution.

The Chinese people have fought generation after generation, aiming to struggle for democratic rights. The Xinhai Revolution once produced a progressive temporary constitution that represented the will of the people, but it was soon torn up by Yuan Shikai. History has proven that without completely overthrowing the counter-revolutionary rule, the Chinese people will never obtain democratic rights. The Chinese people have only under the leadership of the Communist Party been able to defeat the counter-revolutionary forces, achieve revolutionary great victories, and realize true people's democratic politics.

The founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 marked the victory of the people's revolution, and the Common Program is a record of this victory. The achievements of the Chinese people's revolution have developed at high speed, and the political and economic victories achieved since the founding of the country, as well as the fundamental requirements of the country in the transitional period and the common aspirations of the broad masses of people to build a socialist society, all need to be consolidated in the form of a constitution, and on this consolidated basis, advance at a higher speed towards the great socialist society.

Our country has made great progress in all aspects, and the progress in the future will definitely be even greater, which is undeniable. However, the backward phenomena left by history still exist in many aspects. Just take the field of historical science as an example, the modern history of China, especially the contemporary history of China, is extremely rich in revolutionary experience and lessons. If historians can use the viewpoint and method of Marxism-Leninism to sort out the revolutionary history well, it will be of great use to the cultural construction of China. But like us, who are supposed to be studying history, we have not done any decent work in many years. From the perspective of the quality and quantity required by the work, it is terribly backward. Although historians in general have been working hard, it cannot be said that there are no achievements, but the backward phenomenon in the historical field cannot be denied.

Backwardness is a stumbling block to progress. All backward things will have a certain hindering effect on the implementation of the Constitution. We must constantly struggle against it, first of all, to overcome the backward elements in our own thoughts. The cause of our country is developing so fast, we can only move forward, we cannot retreat. The country requires us to work hard, so earnest, what reason do we have to give up backward things!

Our martyrs, from more than a hundred years ago to now, have been paying their precious lives to ensure the victory of the revolution and the safety of the country, we must also have the same spirit to ensure that our work is done well, done better. Everything stipulated in the Constitution, we must strictly abide by it, and realize everything stipulated in the Constitution with actual actions. I am a person who lacks work ability, the people have entrusted me to vote in support of the Constitution at this grand meeting, I am very excited! I am willing to declare in front of the meeting that I will be loyal to the people's democratic system forever, obey the Constitution and laws, and work hard for the people.

Li Weiguang's Speech

Chairman, fellow representatives:

The draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China has been repeatedly discussed by the people of the entire country and revised and passed by the Standing Committee of the Central People's Government. Comrade Liu Shaoqi has also given a detailed explanatory report. We Catholics fully agree with and sincerely support this Constitution because it reflects the fundamental demands and common aspirations of the people of the entire country, and it is also the aspiration of us Catholics.

The basic doctrine of our Catholic Church is "love God above all and love people." The standard for loving God is to measure it with the standard of loving people, that is, in addition to the ritual of respect, the specific manifestation is to love people wholeheartedly, that is, to sacrifice oneself for the benefit of humanity. Therefore, if one does not love people and does not benefit humanity, according to the doctrine, his love for God is hypocritical, not accepted by God, and therefore cannot obtain heaven after death. Just as the Constitution stipulates that we are moving towards a prosperous and happy socialist society, serving the people, and taking the interests of the people as the highest and only goal, it is completely consistent.

The draft Constitution stipulates in the basic rights of citizens that there is no discrimination among religions, and Article 88 further clarifies that we can fully enjoy the freedom of religious belief. In recent years, the priests in various parishes of our Nanjing diocese have been freely holding religious ceremonies and carrying out missionary activities, and every believer is also living a happy religious life. Some people say, "New China has no freedom of religious belief," "Catholics are discriminated against," this statement is absurd, it is a behavior of imperialist elements to deliberately disrupt the unity of the people. From the fact that priests and believers from our Catholic Church have been elected as representatives of the First National People's Congress, it also strongly proves that the government and the people treat us Catholics the same as other religions, without any discrimination. What the government and the people require of us is just that they hope that the Chinese Catholic Church will not be used by imperialism, just like the Catholic Church in other countries, to be managed by local clergy themselves, except for this, there are no other requirements. As for the administration, regulations, beliefs, and organizational and administrative structure of the Church, there is no interference at all, and the property and economy of the Church are also protected. It was like this in the past, and now it is also fixed in the Constitution.

However, it cannot be denied that some local governments have not fully implemented the central government's policy on religion. This is a matter of time, not a matter of principle. At the same time, in these places, there are still a few clergy who have not fulfilled their patriotic duties, and have obstructed believers from participating in various patriotic activities, which also needs to be improved. Therefore, I hope that the clergy and believers of the entire country will resolutely stand up, actively participate in the construction of the motherland, and fulfill the duties of citizens. In this way, the government's religious policy can be more smoothly implemented.

In the few years since liberation, from my own personal experience, I feel that the people's government is sincere and willing to unite and cooperate with us Catholics to build the motherland. In order not to disappoint the expectations of the people of the entire country, I am willing to sincerely abide by the Constitution and laws, and contribute my strength in actual actions. I also hope that the clergy and believers of the entire country will jointly abide by the Constitution and laws, and under the leadership of the people's government, unite as one, do a good job in patriotic and religious work. I believe that our Church has a bright future.

Finally, I wish the conference a successful conclusion.

Wei Guoqing's Speech

Chairman, fellow representatives:

The First Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China has solemnly opened in the capital. At the conference, we listened to Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China. We believe that this Constitution is a summary of the achievements of the Chinese people's revolutionary victory, reflects the common aspirations of the people of all ethnic groups, and fully embodies our country's policy of national equality, giving all ethnic groups a bright and beautiful future. Therefore, we express our complete agreement and sincere support for the Constitution that is about to be passed and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report.

I am honored to participate in the First National People's Congress as a representative of the Zhuang people and to speak here.

The Zhuang people living in the vast southern regions of our country have more than 6.5 million people in Guangxi Province alone. But when it comes to the Zhuang ethnic group, some representative comrades may feel a bit unfamiliar. This is because the reactionary ruling class has always implemented a policy of great nationalism, using various brutal means to try to eliminate the national characteristics of the Zhuang people, vigorously denying the existence of the Zhuang people as a fact, to achieve their purpose of ruling and plundering, making the Zhuang people politically powerless, economically impoverished, culturally oppressed, and thus creating hatred and hostility between the Zhuang people and other ethnic groups. These are the evil results of the reactionary ruling class's national oppression policy.

The Zhuang people, like other brother ethnic groups in the country, are a brave, hardworking, honest, and historically rich ethnic group. In the national democratic revolutionary movement, the Zhuang people, together with other ethnic groups, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, have fought resolutely. From 1929 to 1930, they established their own revolutionary government and revolutionary army, established a vast revolutionary base area, and later continued the long-term revolutionary struggle. After liberation, the system of national oppression was destroyed, and under the guidance of the Communist Party's national policy, the Zhuang people obtained the same political status as other brother ethnic groups, established the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and realized the political right of self-government. We, the Zhuang people, sincerely thank the Communist Party of China and the great leader Chairman Mao!

Through the work of the past few years, national estrangement has basically been eliminated, and the Zhuang people and the Han people and other brother ethnic groups have closely united. Especially after the democratic reforms and regional autonomy work, national unity has been further strengthened. The Zhuang people, in the process of socialist construction and socialist transformation, have been able to fully display their wisdom, political enthusiasm, and production enthusiasm has greatly increased. Under the assistance and care of the people's government, mutual aid and cooperation movements have been carried out in rural areas, agricultural methods have been improved, production has been increased, and people's lives have been initially improved. All this fully proves the greatness and correctness of the Communist Party's national policy. Now, the Constitution further consolidates the national equality policy and fixes it in legal form. In the future, we will abide by and implement the provisions of the Constitution, continue to prevent and overcome local nationalism, learn from advanced ethnic groups, and at the same time, prevent and overcome the remnants of great nationalism in the Zhuang people, respect the status and rights of other brother ethnic groups, strengthen unity in the unified family of the motherland, strive to develop production, actively support the socialist industrialization construction of the country; under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, together with the people of all ethnic groups, strive for the gradual transition to a socialist society.

Fei Guangtai's Speech

Chairman, fellow representatives:

The formulation of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China is a major event in the political life of our people. This Constitution has consolidated the achievements of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao in their heroic struggle, and it fully expresses the fundamental requirements and common aspirations of our country to gradually transition to a socialist society and the broad masses of people to build a socialist society, pointing out the correct path to struggle for the realization of this requirement. Every clause and every word in it fully embodies the interests of our country's people, is a powerful weapon to mobilize and inspire the people of the entire country to actively participate in the socialist transformation, and is a sufficient guarantee for our country to eliminate exploitation and poverty through peaceful means and build a prosperous and happy socialist society. We are heartily pleased with the formulation of such a fundamental law of the People's Republic of China that relates to the vital interests of every individual, so we enthusiastically support this draft Constitution and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft Constitution.

I am a coal mining worker. Looking back at the old society, it was very difficult for those who studied mining to find jobs. The reason was that the large mines in our country were occupied by imperialists, and the small mines were owned by bureaucratic capitalists. Although the underground resources were rich, the state did not exploit them. And imperialists particularly despised Chinese technical personnel, regardless of ability, they were not used. According to my understanding, during the puppet regime, there were no Chinese technical personnel in several large mines in Northeast China. Under the Kuomintang regime, they emphasized cliques, factions, and social relations, so it was also difficult to establish a foothold. Therefore, those who studied mining felt pessimistic and disappointed, and some even turned to other paths.

Since 1949, after liberation, society has turned from darkness to light, the new democratic system has been realized, and the First Five-Year Plan for large-scale economic construction is being implemented and has achieved remarkable results. Mineral resources belong to the entire people, employment for citizens is a right, scientific research is valued by the state, especially the draft Constitution clearly stipulates in Article 6, Article 91, and Article 95, these stipulations are unprecedented in Chinese history.

The draft Constitution Article 27, Clause 9 stipulates that the National People's Congress decides on the national economic plan, this stipulation fully meets the urgent needs of the broad masses. In recent years, we have indeed achieved considerable results in planning work, but what we have done is far from enough. Taking coal mining planning as an example, it can include production and basic construction. In recent years, although the production and basic construction tasks have been continuously increased, in the production aspect, the annual plans are mostly conservative, and then they are always increased. In the basic construction aspect, the annual plans are mostly reckless, and then they are always reduced, thus a series of planning arrangements are not completed and the revision of the plan has arrived, the revision of the plan is not completed and the revision of the plan has arrived again, so in a year, the plan is always made and the plan is always revised, causing the grassroots workers to be confused and lose their goal of struggle. Moreover, basic construction is a preparatory project to ensure the completion of production. If it is not well coordinated and carried out, it will cause serious errors in technical policy in the future. Therefore, I suggest that the departments in charge of planning at all levels should estimate the needs of the state, and formulate a feasible and decisive national economic plan every year.

The draft Constitution Article 91 stipulates the planned development of the national economy, the gradual expansion of employment, the improvement of working conditions, etc. In coal mines, the most threatening factor is natural gas. Just this year, there have been more than ten gas explosions in coal mines nationwide. Therefore, I suggest that the Ministry of Fuel Industry should clearly stipulate that for level three and above gas mines, the working procedure of first venting gas and then mining after excavation must be implemented to prevent gas explosions and improve working conditions, which can also be a concrete manifestation of supporting the Constitution. I feel that this draft Constitution has undergone extensive discussions by the people of the entire country, absorbed the correct opinions of the people, and been revised many times, it is perfect, it is a true people's democratic Constitution. In addition to suggesting that the conference pass it, I am also willing to cooperate with the implementation of the Constitution with a very happy mood and actual actions, and guarantee to do the following:

1. Abide by the Constitution and propagate the Constitution.
2. Cherish national resources and study the rational exploitation of national resources.
3. In work, with the spirit of combining theory with practice, closely unite with the masses of workers, discuss and study together to solve the key problems in work, and continuously improve production under safe conditions.

Ding Ying's Speech

Chairman, fellow representatives:

After listening to Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, I believe it is completely correct, and I enthusiastically support this Constitution.

This Constitution is the Constitution of the transitional period, aiming to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce during this period. Our country is an agricultural country with a large proportion of small-scale peasant economy, and the completion of the socialist transformation of agriculture is an extremely complex and arduous task. In recent years, the Communist Party and the people's government have done a lot of in-depth work in rural areas, with mutual aid and cooperation as the center, the agricultural production movement has been greatly developed. Following this, the scientific and technological requirements for agricultural production have become very urgent, agricultural science and technology must be developed in combination with the agricultural cooperativization movement and the national socialist industrialization needs. We scientific workers, especially agricultural scientific and technological workers, must take on this arduous and glorious responsibility.

Taking South China as an example, the current main task is to increase agricultural production, especially to increase grain production, to support national industrialization. South China is located in the tropics and subtropics, with abundant agricultural resources, natural conditions different from Central and North China, can be mutually adjusted, and has its own unique advantages. For example, for water, drought, wind, frost, and the currently serious pest and disease problems, based on the actual experience of the laboring masses in various places and the advanced scientific technology of the Soviet Union, all can be prevented. For example, Guangdong was originally a heavy rainfall area, but due to the mountainous areas near the sea, the drainage of floodwater is relatively easy, and the general continuous damage does not exceed one week; again, Guangdong also often suffers from drought, but in the main crop watering season, the phenomenon of continuous rainlessness for a whole month is not common, and the humidity is still between 70 and 80 degrees, so it is possible to effectively adjust from relatively small water conservancy projects and improved cultivation methods, seed selection methods, etc., to make production stable and gradually improve. In fact, Guangdong was a famous grain-deficient province in the country during the Kuomintang reactionary rule, with an annual grain deficit of more than ten billion jin at most and several billion jin at least. But since liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party and the people's government, the active mutual aid and cooperation of the peasants, and the struggle for increased production, the entire province's grain can now be self-sufficient, and there is even some surplus grain to be transported out of the province. This year in August, at the First Session of the First People's Congress of Guangdong Province, the representatives of all counties in the province, with full confidence, undertook the state's requirement for Guangdong to increase grain production, guaranteeing to increase rice production by 50% by 1957 compared to 1952. We agricultural scientific and technological workers should take our due responsibilities seriously, from the aspects of stabilizing production and gradually improving agricultural technology reform, actively help the peasants, combine theory with practice, technology with labor, and turn the possible over-fulfillment of the state's planned production into reality. We should also strive to greatly increase the output of industrial raw materials and export goods in the tropics and subtropics to meet the needs of national industrialization.

The draft Constitution Article 95 stipulates that the state guarantees the freedom of scientific research for citizens, and encourages and assists those engaged in scientific education and other creative work. Looking back at the period before liberation, many scientific and technological workers were not used for their studies, and it was difficult to maintain their research work, even to maintain their lives, which is in stark contrast to today's emphasis on science and encouragement of scientific research in the Constitution. This makes me even more believe that scientific workers in the country will definitely follow the path indicated by the Constitution in the future, under the increasingly complete production plan of the state, unite with the broad masses of laboring people, strive for the development of China's scientific cause, for the development of industrial and agricultural production, and for the completion of the glorious task of national industrialization!

Xie Xuehong's Speech

Chairman, fellow representatives:

First of all, I express my support for Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, and I fully support this Constitution. At the same time, I suggest that the conference unanimously pass this Constitution.

I am a Taiwanese. Taiwan is still under American occupation and under the evil rule of the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique. The people of Taiwan have not had the opportunity to participate in the discussion of this draft Constitution and have not had the opportunity to elect their representatives to participate in this conference. But the hearts of the broad and kind-hearted people of Taiwan are fervently towards this conference, eagerly hoping that their compatriots on the mainland will quickly liberate Taiwan. I am very happy to express my opinions with the feelings of a Taiwanese at this conference discussing the draft Constitution.

Taiwan is an inseparable part of China, the People's Republic of China is the beloved motherland of the Taiwanese people, and the Taiwanese people are all Chinese. The achievements of the people's revolution reflected in this Constitution include the part of the long-term heroic revolutionary struggle of the Taiwanese people. The common aspirations of the Chinese people reflected in the Constitution are also the aspirations that the eight million people of Taiwan yearn for day and night. I believe that the people of Taiwan, once they see this Constitution, will be as elated and enthusiastic as the people of the entire country, completely agree with and sincerely support this Constitution, and thus will greatly enhance their courage and confidence to struggle for the liberation of Taiwan.

Under the occupation and rule of the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, the people of Taiwan have been deprived by the Americans and the Chiang clique of the basic rights of citizens as stipulated in this Constitution, and they do not have the right to vote and to be elected, do not have the freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association, parade, and demonstration, more and more people are losing the right to labor and becoming unemployed, more and more people are becoming impoverished and losing the basic guarantee of material life, and they can even be arrested at any time and lose the right to live. But they cannot leave Taiwan freely. When people are in pain, they call for their mother, and the Taiwanese people in distress can only call for their motherland. The Taiwanese people, in addition to uniting and struggling against the dark forces within themselves, especially yearn for their motherland to save them from the depths of suffering, urgently hope to live a happy life with their compatriots on the mainland, and jointly build a prosperous and strong motherland.

Taiwan has always been a part of China. The Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation both clearly stipulate that Taiwan belongs to China and will not allow the United States to occupy it, and will not allow the United Nations to trust it. The Taiwanese people wholeheartedly support and are grateful for the "Joint Declaration of All Democratic Parties and People's Organizations in China for the Liberation of Taiwan." We, the Taiwanese people, will definitely inherit the glorious revolutionary tradition of our martyrs, strengthen unity, accumulate strength, and prepare to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to liberate Taiwan. The patriotic hearts of the Taiwanese compatriots will not be inferior to others. When Li Hongzhang signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, the people of Taiwan issued a proclamation saying: "Whether on a car, on a ship, on the street, in a hotel, or in an official building, as long as they encounter the traitor Li Hongzhang, the people of Taiwan will definitely kill him to thank the heavens, the earth, and the ancestors." Today, the Taiwanese people hate the traitor Chiang Kai-shek more than they hated Li Hongzhang a hundred times, and they must bring Chiang Kai-shek to justice to avenge the hatred of the people of the entire country. The Taiwanese compatriots will not hesitate to make any sacrifice and will definitely, together with their compatriots on the mainland, unite with all those who can be united, and struggle to the end to liberate Taiwan and eliminate the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique.

Liu Guojun's Speech

Chairman, fellow representatives:

The First Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China has opened, which is a great joy for the people of the entire country, and I sincerely congratulate the conference. After listening to Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft Constitution, I fully agree with it and believe that this Constitution not only consolidates the achievements of the revolution, but also points out the aspirations of the people of the entire country for the future. I, like the people of the entire country, welcome the promulgation of this Constitution with the highest enthusiasm.

The industrial and commercial circles of Jiangsu Province, after studying the general line of the state in the transitional period last year and discussing the draft Constitution this year, have realized that capitalism is an unreasonable system, has no future, and must be transformed. Private industrial and commercial operators, through socialist transformation, will definitely have a bright future. We have clarified this direction and all feel happy.

Take the Dazheng Cotton Textile Mill in Nantong and the Changzhou Dazheng Textile and Dyeing Mill as examples. After the implementation of joint state-private ownership, the production relations have changed, and the enthusiasm of the working class for production has reached an unprecedented level. Consequently, the productivity has greatly increased, the production of 20-count cotton yarn has increased to more than 1.3 pounds per spindle, the defect rate of cloth has been reduced to about 1%, the consumption of cotton has been reduced to about 380 jin, the defect rate of 190-number silk blue cloth has been reduced to about 3%, waste has been reduced, quality has been improved, and costs have been reduced, and the appearance has been completely renewed. This proves the superiority of state capitalism, which is much better than the methods of capitalist countries. I believe that when a socialist society is built, the production rate will be much higher than it is now.

According to the relatively large private factories in the entire Jiangsu Province, there are about 2,000, but now only 60 factories have implemented joint state-private ownership. Judging from the current situation of joint ownership, the state-owned representatives can handle personnel arrangements, asset assessments, etc., in an open and honest manner, and the private sector is very satisfied. The recently published "Temporary Regulations on Joint State-Private Ownership Industrial Enterprises" clearly stipulates the methods of profit distribution, etc., guaranteeing the profits that the capitalists should obtain, I believe that many medium and small-sized factories will definitely be willing to follow suit. At the same time, I suggest that the government should, as in the past, do a good job in preparing various items in advance for the joint state-private ownership factories, so as to achieve better results and make industrial and commercial entrepreneurs dare to strive for joint state-private ownership and take big steps towards the path of state capitalism, so that the socialist transformation of industry and commerce can be accelerated and completed.

Most of the private industrial and commercial operators have become clear after discussing the draft Constitution, but there is still a small part that has many concerns, and the extremely selfish and self-centered thoughts have not been solved. In processing and ordering, there are those who cut corners and reduce materials, those who passively resist, and even those who evade taxes and escape funds. In the future, we should continue to strengthen their education, so that they can gradually be transformed in their thoughts and actions, and willingly accept the transformation, and advance through the bright path of state capitalism.

Hu Keji's Speech

I sincerely support the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft Constitution.

Our Constitution is the crystallization of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle. For the growing generation of young children, the Constitution brings them the most benefits, they will enjoy the revolutionary achievements consolidated by the Constitution for a long time; in the great struggle for the thorough implementation of the Constitution, they will become the glorious builders and defenders of socialism.

In the past five years, with the rapid development of our country's construction, the state has brought great happiness to young children. Now, there are more than 54 million young children studying in middle schools and primary schools, exceeding the highest number before liberation by more than one time; the mass organization that carries out communist education for young children— the Chinese Young Pioneers—has nearly a million members; the extracurricular education institutions and cultural activity venues for young children are also increasing year by year; the concern for young children is gradually becoming a new social custom. In the history of China, there has never been such concern and attention for young children as the Communist Party of China and the people's government.

Young children are the most precious wealth of our country, they are the successors of our socialist cause, they are the creative force that will make our motherland even more beautiful and great tomorrow. They must be strong, lively, brave, and honest, they must strive to learn new knowledge and be rich in creative spirit, and become new people of socialism. This is the requirement of the state for the next generation, it is the interest of all people. I believe that this is also the earnest expectation of every parent for their children.

The Constitution clearly stipulates that protecting and educating young children is the responsibility of the state, which tells us that protecting and educating young children is a matter for everyone, a national cause. Now, there are more than 100 million young children in our country, to educate this generation well is a task that is both glorious and enormous. In this regard, schools bear the main responsibility, and the Young Pioneers should also strengthen their work. We must strive to improve the quality of education, through classrooms and various activities, increase children's knowledge, cultivate their noble thoughts of loving the motherland, loving the collective, and loving labor, help them exercise their bodies and cultivate good living habits, so that they can achieve all-round development in intelligence, morality, physique, and aesthetics. In this cause, the work of thousands of teachers and instructors will be respected and supported by the broad masses. However, to educate and cultivate young children, relying only on the work of schools and the Young Pioneers is not enough, the entire society and every family have responsibilities. Parents should not only be models at their workplaces but also should be good teachers for their own children. All state organs, people's organizations, and people from all walks of life should not only actively create various learning and cultural activity conditions for young children but also pay attention to fighting against the bad phenomena that harm the physical and mental health of young children left over from the old society. Now, some places have found serious cases of harming young children, we believe that those criminals should be given the punishment they deserve.

Our Constitution provides all the possibilities for the healthy growth of young children, we should carefully cultivate and educate the new generation, and strive together to ensure the future of our motherland.

Ma Jian's Speech

I am an ethnic Hui educator. In the era of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, people like me would not be allowed to participate in the "national" affairs. Now, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, we have overthrown imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, achieved the great victory of the people's revolution, and the people have gained liberation, the laboring people have gained liberation, and the people of all ethnic groups in our country have united to become a free and equal family of ethnic groups. Today, I am honored to participate in the First Session of the First National People's Congress as a representative of the people of the entire country, I feel extremely honored.

The Constitution of the People's Republic of China is a summary of the rich revolutionary experience and construction experience of the Chinese people, and it reflects the fundamental requirements of the state in the transitional period and the common aspirations of the broad masses of people to build a socialist society. I enthusiastically support the first Constitution of the Chinese people and fully agree with Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report.

The Constitution clearly stipulates religious freedom, ethnic equality, and regional autonomy, and local people's congresses at all levels guarantee the equal rights of ethnic minorities in their administrative regions, which is very correct and thoughtful. The Constitution stipulates that all ethnic groups have the freedom to use and develop their own languages and scripts, and it also stipulates that all ethnic group citizens have the right to use their own ethnic languages and scripts in litigation. This is also very correct. In the future, all ethnic minorities, in addition to using and developing their own ethnic languages and scripts, in order to learn from the advanced experience and high culture of the Han ethnic group, in order to strengthen the friendship and mutual assistance among ethnic groups, they will voluntarily and consciously strive to learn the language and script of the Han ethnic group, this is undoubted.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, our religious beliefs have been completely free. The various shameless rumors of American imperialism and the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique have been self-defeating. The people's government stipulates that half a day off is given for each of the three major festivals of Islam, so that the people of ethnic groups who believe in Islam can celebrate their own festivals, this is a respect and consideration for our customs and habits, we are very grateful, because this is something that did not exist and could not exist in the era of reactionary rule.

In the past five years, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao have shown special concern for the living habits of ethnic minorities. Most of the schools, institutions, enterprises, factories, and mines where Hui people participate in learning or work have already set up halal catering; when various meetings are held, special care is also given to us in terms of food. However, some Hui students and Hui workers still feel inconvenient, such as the students of Dalian Medical College and Huai'an Middle School, and the coal miners in Henggang, have reflected the difficulties they encountered in their diet. In the future, when allocating new college students and graduates, if Hui students of the same major are allocated in batches to certain schools and enterprises, and special instructions are given at the same time, then the leading cadres will not use the excuse of too few people to emphasize difficulties and not provide them with halal catering. When the conscription system is implemented in the future, I hope this problem will be paid attention to.

The only problem for our Hui people is the transformation of the broad masses of small peddlers in cities and rural areas. They are willing to transition from a new democratic society to a socialist society, but they have not yet bought the "ticket." How to make these tens of thousands of Hui peddlers reach the other shore, I believe the people's government will definitely have a meticulous plan.

Young Hui people often ask me a question about Hui customs and habits, and I would like to give them a public answer here. They asked me: If a Hui youth gives up the customs and habits of the Hui ethnic group, is he still a Hui? My answer is affirmative. Because his ancestors are Hui, when filling out the form, if he writes "Hui" in the ethnic column, he does not violate the law. Similarly, if a Han youth voluntarily adopts the customs and habits of the Hui ethnic group, when filling out the form, if he writes "Han" in the ethnic column, he also does not violate the law. From a theoretical point of view, it is of course like this. But if we talk about facts, the situation is different. Because a Hui youth who gives up the customs and habits of the Hui ethnic group will definitely be separated from the Hui masses. Therefore, I sincerely hope that all Hui youth, under the correct leadership of the Party and the people's government, will strive to progress in ideological remolding and work style, and at the same time, connect with the broad masses of Hui people, bring them along to progress, and lead them to a prosperous and happy, infinitely beautiful socialist society.

Li Mingyang's Speech

First of all, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the beloved leader of the people, Chairman Mao, to the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China, and to the heroic People's Liberation Army. Without them, we would not have achieved victory over imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism; without them, we would not have established an independent, democratic, and free People's Republic of China; without them, we would not have formulated this Constitution that fully meets the interests of the state and the people; without them, we would not be able to build a prosperous and happy socialist new society.

Our Constitution is a people's, democratic, scientific, and progressive Constitution. The draft Constitution Article 2 stipulates that "all power in the People's Republic of China belongs to the people." The broad masses believe that our draft Constitution is the "guarantee of a happy life," "every clause represents the interests of the people," so it is the people's Constitution. Our Constitution, in the process of discussion and revision, has allowed every citizen of the People's Republic of China, regardless of class, gender, race, occupation, etc., to participate in the discussion, and everyone can express their opinions, and finally, it must be passed by the National People's Congress elected by the people of the entire country, so it is a democratic Constitution. Our Constitution is based on the summary of historical experience, based on the current specific conditions and circumstances of society, economy, politics, and culture, and determines the goals and tasks of future struggle, so it is a Constitution based on reality, it is correct, it is feasible, so it is a scientific Constitution. Marx has long pointed out that socialism will replace capitalism, this is the law of social development, our draft Constitution clearly stipulates in the preamble: "ensure that our country can eliminate exploitation and poverty through peaceful means and build a prosperous and happy socialist society." Obviously, this is a big step forward compared to the existing capitalism. Since the peace-loving and democratic forces led by the Soviet Union have become increasingly strong, they have begun to reverse the direction of world historical development, that is, from the era of savage war to the era of peaceful coexistence. Our draft Constitution stipulates in the preamble: "Our country's firm and unshakable policy is to strive for the sublime purpose of world peace and human progress." This also shows that our Constitution is in line with the new direction of historical development. We know that what is in line with the law of social historical development is progressive, so it is a progressive Constitution. In short, our Constitution is a new, perfect, and well-considered Constitution, therefore, I fully agree with and support the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft Constitution, and suggest that the conference formally pass our people's Constitution.

In the eager expectation of the people of the entire country, the conference is about to pass the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China. The future question is how to implement it. Of course, this is the common responsibility of all compatriots, and we representatives have an even greater responsibility. I guarantee that under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, I will loyally and conscientiously abide by and implement every clause of the Constitution, and I am willing to contribute all my energy to the realization of every clause of the Constitution. (with picture)

The people of the capital welcome the representatives from all over the country with this magnificent building. Ai Zhongxin, sketch.

### 在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上  代表们关于宪法草案和报告的发言

专栏：

    在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上
    代表们关于宪法草案和报告的发言
    吴玉章代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我们第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议就要通过伟大的中华人民共和国宪法了。这是我国人民政治生活中具有重大历史意义的事件。
    中华人民共和国宪法草案是毛泽东同志代表中国共产党提出并领导宪法起草委员会起草的。这部国家根本大法的产生证明了马克思列宁主义在中国已经获得了并将继续获得胜利。我们的宪法是以马克思列宁主义的原理——特别是马克思列宁主义关于国家与法权的学说——为理论基础，总结了我国争取人民民主的经验并吸取了苏联和各人民民主国家的经验，按照中国的实际情况而完善地制定的。我们的宪法不但在立法上巩固了人民民主革命和国家建设的成果；而且以生产发展的规律、以社会经济发展的规律为出发点，规定了我国依靠国家机关和社会力量，通过社会主义工业化和社会主义改造，保证逐步消灭剥削制度，建立社会主义社会的纲领，反映了国家在过渡时期的根本要求和全国人民的共同愿望。宪法规定了国家机关一律实行民主集中制，为了动员和团结全国人民完成国家过渡时期总任务和反对内外敌人，将继续发挥以中国共产党为领导的人民民主统一战线的作用；为了加强各民族的团结，规定在少数民族聚居的地方实行民族自治，在经济建设和文化建设中照顾各民族的需要，在社会主义改造问题上充分注意各民族发展的特点，使各民族团结成为一个自由平等的大家庭。在整个宪法中处处都体现了马克思列宁主义辩证唯物论和历史唯物论的真理。这个人民的宪法，将成为极大的积极力量，来保证和促进社会主义在我国的完全胜利。
    在宪法通过以后，应该展开广泛的、深入的、全民性的宣传教育。这是贯彻实施宪法的重要条件。从教育的意义上说，我们的宪法和刘少奇同志关于宪法草案的报告，是理论与实际联系的具体范例，又是学习科学的社会主义很好的教科书。在全国范围内进行宪法的宣传教育应当作为长时期的具有根本性质的政治工作，当作人民群众的爱国主义教育和社会主义教育的一个基本内容。我们的国家机关和各种社会群众组织以及宣传教育组织，都应当把宪法的宣传教育当做自己的重要职责，采取各种有效方式和利用各种适当条件，在广大城乡人民群众中进行经常的宣传教育工作，使宪法的精神家喻户晓、深入人心，成为社会生活中每个人的行动规范，而把我们的国家管理工作和建设工作推向前进。
    学习宪法是全国人民大家的事情。全国人民都应当了解宪法的内容和宪法同自己的切身关系，按照宪法行使自己的权力，实现应享的权利，执行应尽的义务，提高社会主义觉悟和国家主人翁的品格，发挥政治积极性和劳动积极性。我们各级人民代表大会代表，作为人民派到各级国家权力机关来的使者，应当首先深入地学习宪法，以身作则，成为宣传宪法和遵守宪法的模范。一切国家机关工作人员都是人民的勤务员，必须认真学习宪法，加强法治观念，按照宪法办事，效忠人民民主制度，服从宪法和法律，努力为人民服务。青年一代是我们国家的未来，宪法教育对于青年有着重大的意义。要使广大青年了解宪法，热爱祖国，积极准备成为国家的社会主义事业的忠实建设者和保卫者。因此，我认为，在中等学校和高等学校中，应当适当地采用苏联宪法教育的经验，将中华人民共和国宪法或包括宪法内容的课程列为共同必修的政治课程，以便进行系统的教育。
    现在，全国人民正在欢欣鼓舞地迎接自己的第一部伟大宪法的庄严诞生。我相信，在中华人民共和国宪法的灿烂光辉照耀之下，全国人民将更加团结一致，在参加国家的一切事业中表现出无穷的力量，为把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗！
    赖若愚代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我认为刘少奇同志的报告，最透彻地表达了中国工人阶级对于中华人民共和国宪法草案的看法。
    中华人民共和国宪法草案公布之后，全国广大的职工群众都热烈地进行了学习和讨论，提出了很多补充和修改的意见。为了迎接全国人民代表大会会议的召开和祝贺即将在这次会议上制定的宪法，全国职工群众在最近几个月以来，更普遍更深入地开展了劳动竞赛，在生产战线上做出了更多的成绩。广大职工群众的这种行动，比任何言语都更加有力地说明他们对于宪法草案的赞成和拥护。
    为什么全国职工群众这样热诚地拥护宪法草案呢？因为他们从宪法草案中不只是看见工人阶级和全国人民的斗争成果已经被巩固下来，而且看见了我们的国家正在逐步地过渡到社会主义社会。正如刘少奇同志在他的报告中所详尽地解释了的：我们的宪法是人民民主的宪法，这是属于社会主义类型的宪法，而不是属于资产阶级类型的宪法。工人阶级热诚地追求着社会主义这个伟大的目标，所以也就热诚地拥护这个宪法草案。上海市的工人们说：“有了人民的宪法，建设社会主义社会更牢靠了。”这一句话代表了全国职工的心情。
    广大职工群众从宪法草案中更清楚地看到了工人阶级对于国家的领导地位，即主人翁的地位。工人阶级的领导保障着社会主义建设和社会主义改造的胜利；同时，这种领导地位也赋予工人阶级一种特殊的责任。这就是说，在社会主义建设和社会主义改造中，工人阶级必须起带头的作用。
    当然，在自己的伟大政党——中国共产党领导下的久经考验的中国工人阶级，是一定能够担负起这种光荣的责任来的。但是我们也应该承认，在工人阶级的队伍中也并不是没有弱点的。由于工人阶级的队伍在迅速地壮大，由于我们还处在小生产者的汪洋大海中，由于资产阶级还存在，由于工会工作中还存在着很多缺点，所以小生产者的习气和资产阶级的影响在工人阶级的队伍中还是很普遍很严重的。在工人阶级的队伍中，不遵守劳动纪律、不爱护国家财产、不注意团结互助等等不良现象依然是一个重大问题。更不用说，工人阶级的文化水平和技术水平，目前还没有摆脱落后的状况。可是，社会主义建设和社会主义改造的伟大事业，恰恰要求工人阶级不但在政治上、组织上是坚强的，而且要求工人阶级具有高度的文化水平和技术水平。工人阶级必须不断地提高自己的觉悟程度和组织程度，必须努力学习文化，学习和掌握先进的生产技术，以革新的精神来改进我们的技术基础。只有这样，才能不断地提高劳动生产率，才能保证达到并且超过国家计划的各项指标，才能加速我们前进的步伐。
    社会主义建设和社会主义改造，是一个复杂而艰巨的斗争，工人阶级不但要忠诚地遵守国家法令，而且必须最警觉地维护国家的法令，向那些破坏国家法令、破坏社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的分子进行坚决的斗争。实行这个宪法，将使我们的斗争更有组织，更有秩序。
    毫无疑问，在以毛主席为首的中国共产党的领导下，中国工人阶级一定能够发扬光荣的革命传统，克服弱点，力求进步，同全国人民更坚强地团结起来，以高度的热情、坚强的信心和英勇的劳动，为实施这个宪法而斗争，为逐步过渡到社会主义社会而斗争。社会主义社会一定要在我们伟大祖国的土地上建设起来。
    陈其尤代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我们的宪法草案，从第一次初稿提出到今天被提交第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议作最后的讨论，已经过半年左右的时间了。在这半年左右的时间中，全国人民都有机会讨论了它，并对它提了许多意见。宪法起草委员会经过几次的修正，才使它达到了今天的形式。现在，这个宪法草案在精神上和结构上虽然和初稿没有很大的不同，但在内容和表达方式上，都已更加充实和完美了。这一个文件的起草的本身，就说明了它是如何的民主。
    这个宪法草案，是我国人民百余年来，尤其是近三十年来在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下英勇奋斗的结晶，也将是我国从新民主主义革命完成到建成社会主义社会这一过渡时期的指针。我衷心拥护这个宪法草案，并拥护刘少奇委员关于这个宪法草案所作的报告。我提议一致通过这个宪法。
    我们的宪法是一部完全符合全国人民愿望的、在我国历史上还没有过的最完美的宪法。但宪法的实行还要依靠全国的人民大众和国家机关工作人员的切实遵守，从中华人民共和国成立以来，我们的国家在各方面的伟大成就，是连我们的敌人也不能否认的；但是在这些伟大的成就中，由于少数干部对中央的政策和指示没有很好地体会和遵守，以致造成某些偏差，使人民不满，政府的威信也受到了影响，这是无可讳言的。我们广东在土改运动中对某些华侨问题处理失当，在海外造成不良影响，即其一例。这种偏差的发生，固然是由于执行的干部事前不肯调查研究，又不向上级请示报告所致，但其基本原因则是对人民的利益不关心，以致把好事办成坏事。
    现在宪法草案上明白写出了：“一切国家机关必须依靠人民群众，经常保持同群众的密切联系，倾听群众的意见，接受群众的监督。”又说：“一切国家机关工作人员必须效忠人民民主制度，服从宪法和法律，努力为人民服务。”我希望从今以后，我们国家机关的工作人员必须严格地实行宪法的每一条每一句。全国人民更不要放弃自己的权利，拿出当家作主的精神，对国家机关工作人员经常监督，使妨害人民利益的事不再发生，我们光明和伟大的前途才会更光辉灿烂。
    代表们！当我们在这里参加我国历史上第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议制定中华人民共和国宪法的时候，我们是万分欢欣鼓舞的。但是，我们
  的国土台湾还被美国帝国主义侵占着，几百万同胞还在美国的走狗蒋介石卖国集团的统治之下过着水深火热的生活。今年八月二十二日各民主党派和各人民团体曾经发表了为解放台湾联合宣言。我们坚决拥护这个联合宣言，更要拿出一切力量来为早日解放台湾而奋斗。正义是在我们这一方面，我们一定能解放台湾。
    叶剑英代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案，这是每一句每一条都代表着我国各族人民最大的最长远利益的根本大法，提议会议通过。刘少奇同志关于宪法草案的报告，用马克思列宁主义的深刻理论和我国过渡时期的复杂的实际相结合，正确而简明地说明了宪法草案中许多重大问题。我完全同意这个报告。宪法草案经过三个月的全民讨论，千锤百炼，义正词严，获得了举国一致的拥护，成为鼓舞全国人民为加速社会主义建设和社会主义改造而斗争的物质力量，成为鼓舞全国人民军队提高警惕、提高技术、严守纪律、加强团结、为保卫伟大的祖国反对国内外敌人侵略、破坏的伟大力量。
    中国人民从历史教训和切身体验中懂得了根据事实来认识真理。把我们国家真正的人民民主制度同资本主义国家的虚伪的民主制度和蒋介石卖国集团的法西斯独裁制度作个比较，把解放前后生活情况的变化作个比较，把解放前后国家面貌与国际地位的改变作个比较，根据这种实事求是的分析和比较，就很容易得出真理。真理告诉我们中国人民：虽然经过了百年来流血牺牲、英勇奋斗、前仆后继、百折不回的革命斗争，但只有获得了工人阶级和中国共产党的领导，才取得了彻底的胜利。这个胜利的果实就是工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的中华人民共和国，这个国家的人民拥有一切的权力，这种权力今天明文规定在我们的宪法上。这个历史事实，使人民真正相信了毛主席说的话：“真正的宪政决不是容易到手的，是要经过艰苦斗争才能取得的。”革命的果实既然来得如此的艰难，人民就可以而且应该知道，只有来得最艰难的东西才是最值得宝贵和最应当保护的东西。
    宪法统一了全国人民的意志，团结了全国人民的力量，端正了全国人民生活的准则，整齐了全国人民向社会主义前进的步伐。全国人民将在宪法的指引下，通过和平道路，逐步过渡到社会主义社会。
    这部人民的宪法是我国人民幸福的保证书。宪法保证了工人阶级的领导，领导全国人民努力进行社会主义的工业化。宪法保证了全国农民和手工业者在工人阶级领导下组织起来，努力生产，经过逐步合作化的道路过渡到社会主义社会。宪法保证了资本家只要明白大势所趋，愿意接受社会主义改造，不违法，不破坏人民的财产，就将得到国家的照顾，将来的生活和工作将得到适当的安排，他的政治权利也不会被剥夺。属于人民的知识分子是我们国家的宝贵财富，他们应该在宪法的指引下努力进行思想改造，参加社会主义的建设工作，在各个战线和各个岗位上发挥知识的作用。
    宪法特别鼓舞了我们伟大祖国的拓荒者，这就是中国人民优秀的儿女——中国人民解放军、中国人民志愿军和一切人民武装力量。它们是中国共产党和毛主席亲自组织领导和统率的人民军队，它们曾经同力量大过我们几十倍的并有很多帝国主义帮助的强大敌人，进行了史无前例的三十年如一日的革命战争。它们打垮了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义联合起来的蒋介石国民党的统治，它们扫荡了残存在祖国大地上的一切反革命的残砖碎瓦，它们击碎了美国侵略集团对我祖国东北的侵略阴谋。中国人民武装还英勇地进行了伟大的抗美援朝斗争，保卫了祖国的边疆，为祖国的建设铺平了道路。它们经历过战争时期的千辛万苦，也接受过胜利的人民所给予的爱戴和光荣。今天我国人民正同心同德地向社会主义的康庄大道稳健前进，但是我们还面对着凶恶的美帝国主义。它侵占着我国的台湾，还积极武装蒋介石卖国集团，企图在我国阴谋复辟；最近更不甘心于日内瓦会议的失败，又拼凑了一个“东南亚公约”的军事集团，准备扩大对我国及亚洲人民的侵略。在这种形势下，我们祖国的安全和社会主义的建设仍然受到严重的威胁。但是，我们有根据相信，在政治上和军事上久经锻炼的人民武装，一定可以克服目前自身所存在的弱点，完成宪法草案第二十条和第一○三条所给予的保卫人民革命和国家建设的成果、保卫国家的主权、领土完整和安全的光荣任务。人民武装必须完成自己的任务，必须解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，完成祖国的完全统一。必须坚决实行宪法所规定的义务兵役制，并努力学习苏军先进经验，建设现代化的国防军。
    毫无疑义的，宪法的正式通过与实施，将会激发起全国人民和人民军队高度的爱国主义热情。中国人民最优秀的儿女，为了我们伟大的祖国，将会更加坚定地更加勇敢地贡献出他们自己的一切。
    我这次以虔敬的心情，参加第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，听了毛主席的开幕词，听了刘少奇同志关于宪法草案的报告及各位代表的发言，深深地认识到宪法的意义十分伟大，宪法交给我们的任务尤其伟大。作为一个全国人民代表大会代表，作为一个国家机关工作人员，作为一个中国共产党员，我们应当永远牢记着毛主席在开幕词中所指示的话：“应当努力工作，努力学习苏联和各兄弟国家的先进经验，老老实实，勤勤恳恳，互勉互助，力戒任何的虚夸和骄傲，……”我们应当在自己的工作岗位上，努力工作，努力学习，随时发现和改正自己工作中的缺点和错误，最低限度要做一个被人民认为不坏的人民的勤务员。最后，让我复诵一句毛主席在开幕词中的号召：“全中国六万万人团结起来，为我们的共同事业而努力奋斗！”伟大的祖国万岁！
    刘文辉代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意并衷心拥护刘少奇委员关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告，我毫无怀疑地主张：通过这个宪法草案。
    我个人对于宪法草案序言中关于统一战线作用的指示，感到特别亲切。我在旧中国几十年，一直是反动统治阶级的当权派，虽然我多年来反对蒋贼介石，但这只是反动统治阶级的内部矛盾，反蒋并不等于革命。在西南解放时，我响应中国共产党和毛主席的号召，决然起义，才走上人民的道路。可是当时对于党的统一战线政策，认识还是比较模糊的。记得那时有一位党的高级负责同志叫别人转告我说：某某先生，这次起义才算真正给人民作了一件好事。我当时听了很不舒服，后来经过长时间的学习，又经过各种政治运动和社会改革运动，才逐渐明确地认识到自己过去的错误。五年以来，我在党的领导下，不断地学习着、锻炼着，取得了一定的进步。这次我非常光荣地当选为全国人民代表大会代表，在选举过程中，我又受到了一次深刻的群众教育。几年来的实际生活，使我深深地体会到党的统一战线政策是正确的，伟大的。
    但是另一方面，根据我在西南的观察，在统一战线政策的具体执行上，也是有缺点的。比方对统
  一战线内部成员的缺点和错误，缺乏及时的批评与教育。希望今后一发觉某人犯了错误，就应及时地给以批评教育，帮助改正，不要使他由小错演变成大错。此外，地方政府工作干部在执行各种具体任务时，抱着争取超额完成任务的工作态度，这当然是好的；但某些干部以片面观点来争取“超额”，这就坏事了。我们必须深入了解负担者的实际能力，如果只是片面地强调任务，不问具体情况，就来一个“超额”，而实际上为负担者所不能胜任，即使任务勉强完成了，政治上是会受到损失的，群众将产生不满情绪，因而要影响政府同人民之间的团结。
    宪法草案序言中说：“今后在动员和团结全国人民完成国家过渡时期总任务和反对内外敌人的斗争中，我国的人民民主统一战线将继续发挥它的作用。”由此可知，我们今后统一战线的任务仍然是巨大的。我们除了希望在统一战线的具体执行上能够克服一切的缺点，而主要的问题还是在于我们统一战线内部成员的自我改造。作为一个起义的军人，我应该尽我一切努力积极发挥统一战线的作用，将
  一切可能团结的人团结起来；并且我要加强改造自
  己，在思想认识上获得进一步的提高。我深深地感觉到像我这样的人，在旧社会生活了几十年，旧的
  思想意识是不容易改变的。解放后，我经过长时期学习，自以为思想已经改造了、提高了；但当土地改革和“三反”“五反”运动的时候，我的家族、亲戚、朋友、旧属向我一诉苦，我的思想就模糊起来，不自觉地同情这些人。因此，我决心进行进一步的思想改造和提高。我认为像我这样的人，假如获得彻底的思想改造，逐步地以社会主义思想把自己武装起来，那么，我们的统一战线，在完成国家过渡时期总任务和反对内外敌人的斗争中，一定能发挥更大的作用。
    今后我决定在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，在人民群众的教育和监督下，认真学习，努力工作，加强改造自己，从而尽到一个人民代表的职责，更好地发挥统一战线的作用，保证宪法的贯彻实施，使我们的国家向着繁荣幸福的社会主义社会胜利前进。
    丁玲代表的发言
    当我走进了会场，当我站起来讲话的时候，我感觉到我的心在战抖，在压制不住地激动。我要向大家，向全世界倾诉出我的比高山还厚、比海洋还深的感受。这是多少年的辛酸，多少年的血泪，多少革命者献身的结果啊！许多熟悉的面孔在我脑中涌现，许多熟悉的声音在我耳旁回旋。我看见农民，笑脸上挂着泪珠，沉重地说：“我做了几十年的牛马，现在才做上了‘人’”。工人们挥着拳头说：“我们再也不是臭工人，再也听不到老板骂我们：‘我能让你们活，就能治你们死。’我们已经是中国的主人。”老大娘告诉我：“打倒了地主，我翻了一个身，男女平等算又翻了个身，现在只差学好文化，翻第三个身啦。”还有白胡子老汉，他们住在休养所，他们说：“多奇怪的事啊！我们不能想的，不敢想的幸福都有了，哪一个夜晚，我都舒服地睡着了，可是又从梦里笑醒了。”我看见青年人，他们充满着欢欣，唱着“我们要和时间赛跑”，谈着怎样改革技术，提高产量、质量，超额完成国家计划。他们充满了劳动创造的信心。我听到那守卫在遥远的祖国边疆的战士们的宣誓，他们全心全意地保卫着我们，保卫祖国的建设，保卫全世界人民所要求的“和平”。那些少数民族的兄弟姊妹也歌唱不尽，他们唱着：“天上星星颗颗亮，宪法条条记在心，民族一律都平等，团结成个大家庭。……”我看见湘西的一个苗民老太太，她宁愿自己担负家庭的主要劳动，把独生儿子送到民族中学去念书，她同我说：“要当家理事呀，没有文化行么？”中国少年儿童剧团的山青同志写了最动人的诗，他说：“……我开始读那些没画的书，我开始想像一幅美丽的图画，在这幅画里，我们穷孩子穿上了新衣，在这幅画里，我们身旁坐着微笑的妈妈，终于一个伟大的人使我看见了，可是他并不是一幅纸上的画呀，它比我想像的画要美上千倍百倍，它就是我们正在建设的国家。……”这首诗替许多妈妈、孩子，替千万人说出了心中的话。这一切欢呼、赞颂，和坚定的誓言，都只为了一件事，为了中华人民共和国宪法的诞生。这是人民的宪法，它给人以尊严，给人以道德的标准，给人以力量，给人以崇高的感情，人在这里充实了，武装了，提高了，人懂得为什么去斗争。宪法是斗争的果实，但并不是表示斗争的结束。我们的争取新生活、反对旧生活的斗争是永远不能结束的。就在不久以前，我记得，在安徽黄山有一个摸山的老头，他是同悬崖绝壁、深山野林打了三十多年交道的人，牙齿都掉完了，他同我说：“共产党好，毛主席好，政府好，村里大家都过好了，可是咱们村上还有一个坏干部，是地主的走狗，混进了共产党，他不准我拆自己的房子，他欺压老百姓，他的余粮比谁的也多，可是卖给国家的很少。”也是在最近，在河北省一个村子里我的一个老熟人，他把写了几年也不敢发的匿名信交给我，他说：“为什么杀了我兄弟的还乡团还在村子上洋洋得意呢？”同志们！这样沉痛的事情在我们国土上还有不少，我们得坦白地承认。人人有权利，人人就有义务。我是一个普通的作家，我同大家一样，同人人一样，都负有神圣的责任。我们拥护我们的宪法，我们就要遵守它，宣传它，和宪法所不允许有的东西作坚决的斗争。让我们大家为我们的国家，为我们的人民，为我们的宪法的实现，献出我们一切的力量吧！人民的宪法万岁！中国人民的领导者——共产党、毛主席万岁！
    徐四民代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我以缅甸华侨代表的身份，衷心热烈地拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案和刘少奇委员所作关于宪法草案的报告。
    自从中华人民共和国宪法草案在国外报纸上刊载之后，便引起了广大侨胞的欢欣鼓舞。特别是宪法草案的内容明确规定了“中华人民共和国保护国外华侨的正当的权利和利益。”这一条文的每一个字都深深地印在国外广大侨胞的心坎里。
    我们的祖国在这几年来进行了一系列史无前例的建设，并且取得了辉煌的成就。这一切宝贵的成就，提高了祖国在国际上的地位，使国外华侨对祖国更加热爱。因此，解放后的几年来，就有成千成万的国外华侨回到自己祖国的怀抱来。在他们当中，有的是因为在当地难于生活下去而回国的；有的是在爱戴祖国的热情下，为参加祖国的伟大建设而回国的；有的是为了要接受祖国的进步文化和技能而回国的。他们到了祖国之后，都热切地要求实现他们的愿望。
    华侨代表小组在讨论宪法草案第九十八条的时候，我曾建议在这一条中加上“对归国华侨给予适当的协助和安置。”我之所以提出这个意见，是鉴于这些刚回到祖国的华侨，不管是回国就业的侨胞也好，回国升学的华侨学生也好，由于他们在国外是生活在资本主义的社会里，长期生活在同祖国社会制度根本不相同的环境内，因而除了对祖国有热烈的爱这点是共同的以外，他们不论在思想认识和生活习惯方面，都同国内同胞有些不一样，我们也不能要求他们刚回到祖国就同国内同胞完全一样，这是很自然的。国内的同胞在中国共产党的领导下，受过各项社会改革运动的教育，他们的思想意识已经大大地提高了，而刚从国外回来的华侨，刚由不同的社会里回到祖国来，思想、生活受着国外那种社会的影响，因此，一回到祖国的怀抱，在各种不同的新事物面前，就显出了有在许多实际问题上赶接不上的困难，这一情况是必须加以照顾的。我的意见曾引起了热烈的讨论。大家认为这是具体的工作问题，同时国外华侨回到祖国之后是祖国的公民之一，也有同国内公民一样的权利，因而不必太具体地规定在宪法草案第九十八条中。我同意了大家的意见。但我希望并要求各地侨务机关及有关部门，更加关心和照顾刚回到祖国的华侨和华侨青年及学生在思想、认识、习惯各方面的情况，要更耐心地加强对他们的思想教育，并且在投资的、就业的、升学的各个问题上面给以适当的协助和安置，慢慢地提高他们，耐心地教育他们，热情地团结他们，使得他们在不很长的时间内就能够习惯在祖国弟兄的行列里，这是完全可以做到的，并且必须要这样做的。
    在讨论到地方各级人民代表大会和地方各级人民委员会组织法草案的时候，也引起了很热烈的讨论。大家认为在华侨事务较多的县和不设区的市，有设立管理华侨事务的机构的必要，因为县、市政府是执行侨务政策的基层机构，过去在某些地方没有好好地贯彻上级规定的侨务政策，而出现了一些偏差。几年来祖国政府对归侨的关怀可以说是无微不至，在侨务工作上也有了很大的成就。这些成就，可以说是自有华侨以来华侨和祖国的关系史上所未有过的。但是今天我们并不能为了有过去的成就而自满。我们不但要求负责办理侨务工作的机构和其他国家行政机构注意到侨务工作，同时我们还要求在华侨事务较多的基层的党政负责机关，负责同志，都能够多注意侨务工作，认真贯彻中央人民政府规定的侨务政策。我们要求在原有成就的基础上，把今后的侨务工作向前再推进一步。使得广大国外华侨更加热爱祖国，更加团结在祖国的周围。
    赵忠尧代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    全国人民正以无比的热情，迎接中华人民共和国宪法的诞生。这个宪法是祖国人民百余年来英勇奋斗的果实。尤其值得我们庆贺的是：它不但包含着全国人民长期所渴望的基本人权的保障，而且也包含着我们过渡到幸福的社会主义社会的保证。这是世界上最新型的宪法之一。在中国，只有在共产党和毛主席的领导下，只有在解放以后才能产生这样的宪法。
    解放以来，全国人民在共产党领导之下，依照共同纲领的规定，完成了一系列的伟大的社会改革。这些社会改革的胜利，为有计划地进行经济建设、逐步过渡到社会主义社会准备了必要的条件。所以在目前，我们能够有比共同纲领更为完备更为进步的宪法。这个宪法草案，已经经过全国人民的学习和讨论。大家不但了解它的具体条文，而且也进一步认识它的基本精神。无疑的，在这个宪法正式通过以后，全国人民一定能够很好地遵守它，并且依照它的精神，在积极方面，对于社会主义的建设，发挥更大的作用。
    几年以来，各级国家机关干部和各方面的工作人员由于不断地学习和进步，极大多数都能按照人民民主制度的精神，密切联系群众，努力为人民服务。但是也有极少数的领导干部和工作人员，因为和群众接触太少，或者因为骄傲自满，不能倾听人民群众的意见，不能接受群众的监督，以至于犯了各种大小不同的错误。作为国家机关的干部，我们一定要特别体会宪法草案第十七条的精神，运用批评和自我批评的武器，尽量吸取群众的智慧，提高群众的积极性，发挥民主集中制的最大效力。
    社会主义社会的建立，是和科学的发展分不开的。在宪法草案第九十五条里，规定国家保障进行科学研究的自由，对于从事科学事业的公民的创造性工作，给以鼓励和帮助。我们的宪法不但重视科学工作，而且重视科学研究的自由。全国科学工作者，对于这一条特别感到兴奋。无疑的，这一条也将保证我国科学工作者，发挥最大的积极性，去发现科学真理，应用科学研究的成果，不断地提高我国人民的物质和文化生活的水平。
    社会主义的建设是一个艰巨而伟大的工作。在前进的过程中，稍不小心就会走弯路。我们的宪法，规定了建设社会主义的方向和道路。它的每一条每一句，都指示我们生活和工作的方法。因为这个宪法的完成，是依照历史发展的规律，根据中国实际的情况，参照了兄弟国家先进的经验，吸取了千百万群众的智慧，它将保证我们沿着最适当的途径，以最快的速度，进入社会主义社会。它将保证我们以最适当的步骤，促进世界和平和人类的进步。
    赵毛臣代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意和拥护宪法草案及刘少奇同志关于宪法草案的报告。在这里，我要用两重身份讲几句话。一重身份是全国人民代表大会的一个代表，一重身份是中国人民志愿军的一个战士。我和我的同志们——中国人民志愿军的全体指挥员和战斗员，都抱着对祖国的无限热爱，来迎接第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的召开，迎接中华人民共和国宪法的诞生。我们感到，我们在抗美援朝前线所流的血并没有白流，我们不惜牺牲所保卫的一切最珍贵的事物，现在都集中反映到宪法上来了。还有比这更令人兴奋鼓舞的事么！
    我们来自中国人民志愿军的代表，都受到特别重大的委托。伟大的祖国把抗美援朝的光荣任务委托给了我们全军，现在全军又把忠于祖国的意志委托给我们带到大会上来。我们全军现在都执行着祖国的命令：同朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军亲密团结，坚决遵守朝鲜停战协定，防止敌人的任何袭击和破坏活动，同时帮助朝鲜人民重建他们被毁坏了的家园。我们了解的很清楚，朝鲜问题还没有得到和平解决，美帝国主义和李承晚集团还在进行破坏朝鲜停战协定的阴谋活动。他们一直都在使朝鲜停战处于不稳定的状态，也一直在利用这种不稳定状态来继续制造国际紧张局势。我们完全懂得，在这种局势下，我们的责任就是：不松懈，不自满，永远忠诚地执行祖国人民的意志。
    永远忠于祖国，这是中国人民志愿军的誓言。我们从就要被本次会议通过的宪法草案里看到了我们祖国的光明伟大的前途。宪法里明白地规定我们的祖国要通过和平的道路消灭剥削和贫困，建设繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。而为了建设繁荣幸福的社会主义社会，宪法里又明白地规定了以服务于世界和平和人类进步为崇高目的的对外政策。这就充分表现了我国人民爱好和平的意愿和为和平事业而斗争的意志。中国人民志愿军对伟大祖国履行的誓言就是：依照祖国人民爱好和平的意愿，执行祖国人民为和平事业而斗争的意志，保障祖国人民在建设社会主义的道路上能够享受到和平的利益。
    我们伟大祖国的日新月异的面貌鼓舞着我们，现在，全国人民代表大会和宪法又以新的力量和信心鼓舞着我们。我们中国人民志愿军的全体指挥员和战斗员，决心同全国人民一起，为了祖国的社会主义事业贡献出我们的一切。我们要像特级英雄黄继光烈士的遗言那样，“为了祖国，我们什么都能舍得！”我们要像在劳动战线上表现出英勇精神的劳动弟兄那样，在我们自己的岗位上，经常保持着高度的警惕，严密地警戒着敌人，时刻准备粉碎敌人的挑衅和破坏，为争取朝鲜问题的和平解决而奋斗，为保障祖国的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业而奋斗。
    汪胡桢代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    从一九四九年我国取得了人民革命的伟大胜利的日子起到现在为止，为时不过短短的五年，但我国各方面都已经表现出飞跃的进步，改变了整个国家的面貌。没有疑问，这是从我们身上解除了一切政治的、经济的、文化的束缚的结果，使得全国六万万人民潜在的力量得到了自由的发展，因而造成了历史上任何一个时代所没有的新气象。这应归功于中国共产党、人民政府和毛主席的英明领导和广大人民群众的努力。
    拿我亲身的体验来说：我是一个水利工作者，从进大学的日子起，就准备一辈子为国家建设水利工程而努力的。但毕业以后，先后经历了军阀混战和国民党统治的两个时期，整整浪费了我半世纪的光阴，没有完成一些实际的工作。虽然曾经尽心竭力地做成了几种水利工程的计划，但仅不过供人空谈一阵，不久就被全部搁起。在旧社会里，统治阶级是不为人民群众的利益着想的，因此水利工作者也同一般科学技术工作者一样，到处碰壁，找不到出路。
    解放以后，情况有着根本的改变。最近五年来，我国完成的水利工程已经大大地超过了历史上任何一个时期，空谈了一百年的治淮工程，计划了三十多年的永定河治本工程，人们一辈子憧憬的水力发电事业，都不再是梦想，而已经变成了现实。在我国的土地上，人民用自己的双手建成了大大小小的水库和水闸，修治了无数的河道和堤防。靠了这许多工程，不但使连年农业生产得到一定的保证，而且在今年的夏季，胜利地挡住了打破一百年纪录的大洪水，减轻了水灾给予人民的损失。这许多成就，在没有把社会生产力解放出来的旧社会里是不可想像的。虚度了半世纪光阴的我，也有机会来参加热火朝天的大建设，参加治淮工程，最近又完成佛子岭水库的连拱坝。我充满了新的希望，充满了新的力量，愿意同全国水利工作者一起更好地为人民多做一点事。我更体会到只有在人民自己当家的人民民主制度下，科学技术的研究才受到国家的鼓励和帮助。因此我决心用全力来拥护这部人民民主的宪法，为它的实施而奋斗。
    果基木古代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我衷心拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案和刘少奇委员的报告，并决心为其贯彻实现而努力。
    自解放以来，西康彝族人民在祖国的民族大家庭里，享受了民族平等的权利，当了国家的主人。在人民政府的领导下、在先进的汉族老大哥的支援帮助下，我们彝族地区的各项建设都有一些发展，增加了铁质农具，部分改变了“刀耕火种”的落后状态，农业生产比解放前增加了百分之二十以上。彝族人民现在可以穿上布衣、吃到盐巴，疾病和死亡率大大减少了，小娃娃也可以入学读书了。几年来，我们深刻地体验到，彝族人民只有团结在统一的祖国的大家庭内，在中国共产党的领导下，在汉族的帮助下，才能进步，跟随祖国的前进走向更幸福的生活。
    彝族在我们祖国的大家庭里，还落后于其他民族，因此我们必须更加巩固民族之间和民族内部的团结，力求进步，加倍努力，才能赶上先进民族地区，逐步过渡到社会主义社会。
    现在还有一些反革命分子潜伏在彝族地区，他们企图用各种阴谋手段破坏民族团结，扰乱社会秩序，损害祖国在彝族地区的各项建设。应将这些反革命分子彻底肃清，彝族地区工作才能前进。
    彝族内部还有许多落后的不合理的现象，也是我们彝族人民发展道路上的障碍，也必须逐步地加以改变。我们彝族人民应以诚恳的态度向先进地区、先进民族学习。
    彝族人民在各项事业的发展中，有许多困难是彝族人民自己不能够克服的，如干部、财政、技术等都需国家的照顾和支援；都需先进地区和汉族人民的帮助。过去几年来我们各方面的工作都有些成就，这正是因为得到了帮助和支援的结果。但是从需要来看，派到彝族地区的干部还少，公路也还没有一条，这对彝族地区工作的进展是有很大影响的，需要逐步地加以解决。汉族干部在彝族地区工作是十分辛勤艰苦的，彝族人民十分感激，把他们
  当作亲人；只有个别人员还有看不惯彝族的落后状态，有不耐烦或不安心于彝区工作的。在我们前进道路上是有困难的，但相信在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的领导下，我们是能够克服的，我们完全有信心把彝族地区同祖国其他地区一样逐步地建设好。
    高崇民代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案，完全同意刘少奇委员关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告。
    将要通过的中华人民共和国宪法，是我国建设社会主义社会的宪法。严格地遵守和坚决地贯彻这个宪法，乃是我国顺利地建成社会主义社会的重要保证。
    为着按照宪法所规定的道路，使我国过渡到社会主义社会，全国人民必须在中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府和毛主席领导下，进一步地增强团结，进一步地巩固和加强人民民主统一战线。毫无疑问，我国人民民主统一战线，在全国范围内的民主革命和一切社会改革当中，起了很大作用，而且有了很大的成绩。中国人民民主统一战线，在中国共产党领导下，是日益巩固和扩大的，各民族、各民主阶级和各民主党派、各人民团体之间是团结的。但是，我们也可以看到，有的机关在具体贯彻统一战线政策上，也还存在着某些缺点。这些缺点，表现在充分发扬民主不够，如有的机关在处理和解决一些重要问题时，同各方面人士进行协商不够；也有的同志，倾听和尊重群众的意见不够。再就是表现在对一些民主人士的帮助教育不够，如有的同志，对他们的缺点和错误，不能及时地进行具体的批评教育，而是采取迁就、敷衍等消极态度。这样，就不能达到团结教育和改造他们的目的。以上这些缺点，主要原因是由于这些同志，对于统一战线政策的认识还不足。因此，我以为今后应该进一步加强统一战线政策的教育，提高对于统一战线政策的认识，适当地开展批评和自我批评，把各方面的代表人物和群众更加紧密地团结在中国共产党和政府的周围。
    我认为，无论任何人，要想在国家各种建设中发挥一定的作用，就必须诚心诚意接受共产党和人民政府的领导。从东北民盟地方组织来看，在盟员中还有些同志，对于共产党和人民政府的领导，还没有做到知无不言、言无不尽的地步；对于团结进步的重要性还认识不足，缺乏国家整体观念，滋长着骄傲自满情绪，抱着个人主义，不肯虚心学习。所以几年来，我们应当做好的工作，有的未能完全做好。这些现象，是同中华人民共和国宪法的精神不相符合的，今后应当坚决克服。
    我深信，中华人民共和国宪法草案在本届全国人民代表大会第一次会议通过之后，全国人民必将以实际行动坚决保证它的贯彻和实行。我也深信，在宪法的伟大光辉照耀下，各方面存在的缺点和错误，必能迅速地得到纠正。全国人民一定会更加紧密地团结起来，发扬高度的爱国主义和艰苦奋斗的精神，遵循我国宪法所规定的道路，为建成社会主义社会而奋斗！为胜利地解放台湾而奋斗！
    最后，我提议我们的这次会议正式通过中华人民共和国宪法草案。
    喜饶嘉错代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    人民的宪法是全国人民百年以来梦寐以求的理想，今天在中国共产党的领导下变成了现实。我们表示热烈拥护，并为其彻底实现而奋斗。
    宪法草案第三条规定了民族平等团结的政策，并根据此政策规定了民族自治地方的自治机关管理本地方的财政，组织本地方的公安部队，制定自治条例和单行条例，使用当地民族通用的一种或者几种语文执行职务。同时，序言指出：“国家在经济建设和文化建设的过程中将照顾各民族的需要，而在社会主义改造的问题上将充分注意各民族发展的特点。”充分保障了少数民族平等的权利。青海是多民族地区，五年以来，由于推行了民族区域自治，广泛地团结了各族人民，调解了民族纠纷，基本上消灭了民族隔阂、剿灭了残余股匪，大大地减少了人畜的疫病，稳步地发展了农牧业区的经济和文化，从而改变着贫困和落后的状况，出现了“草原平靖、人畜两旺”的新气象。但仍有缺点，由于过度宽大，个别品质恶劣者，欺骗政府，玩忽法令，而使守法者痛心。在统购统销中，发生过强迫命令，曾引起对政府的宗教和风俗习惯政策的疑惑，今后必须努力克服。
    宪法草案第八十八条规定了中华人民共和国公民有宗教信仰的自由，事实证明：新中国是完全执行了宗教信仰自由政策的，如保护寺院和宗教界的爱国人士，布施募化完全自觉自愿。成立了中国佛教协会，团结了各民族的佛教徒，不分派别，共同进步。提高了佛教徒的政治地位，如青海省选出的九个全国人民代表大会代表中的六个少数民族代表，和六个专区级自治区的主席、副主席，大部都有宗教信仰。特别重要的是：和平解放西藏后，达赖喇嘛与班禅额尔德尼结束了长期不团结的历史而趋于水乳交融的亲密团结，使佛教盛行的西藏回到祖国的民族大家庭来。现在达赖喇嘛与班禅额尔德尼联袂出席了本届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，打开了汉藏民族和西藏内部圆满幸福的新宝藏，从而给信仰宗教的各族人民带来思想和行动上的不断进步。毛主席向西藏致敬团作的关于共产党保护宗教信仰自由的指示，是和保护宗教信仰自由的事实极相吻合的，足见保护公民宗教信仰的自由是坚定不移的政策。
    过去国民党御用制宪的金字招牌，标榜民主，制造骗局，只是为了骗人，完全无意实践，而今天的宪法是经得起烧、断、磨的黄金般的真实性的宪法。现在蒋贼尚窃据着我国的领土台湾，正在变本加厉地散布破坏民族团结和宗教的谰言，因此，我们必须继续加强爱国主义的思想教育，巩固各民族之间的团结，提高警惕，共为解放台湾和迅速建设社会主义的祖国大家庭而不倦地努力。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中国各民族大团结万岁！
    中国各族人民伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
    袁雪芬代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我是一个戏曲演员，站在这个庄严的讲坛上，我感到非常的光荣。
    在我短短的人生的道路上，我尝遍了旧社会给我的悲苦和辛酸。在我不太长的演剧生活中，我也扮演了不少被旧社会迫害的女性。我不一定都熟悉她们的生活和斗争，但是由于我自己的遭遇，我仿佛也能体会到中国妇女几千年来渴望自由、寻求解放的精神。我扮演过古代传说中的女性祝英台、白娘子，我也扮演过辛亥革命时期的祥林嫂。她们身受的压迫和苦痛，同我们自己在解放前的遭遇几乎是完全一样的。事实上，在有些方面我们自己所受的压迫和苦痛，也许要比我们扮演的角色还要沉重。因为在旧社会里，我是一个被鄙视的所谓“女戏子”。
    我不想在这里叙述一个“女戏子”在旧社会的苦痛，关于这些，五年来我们的姊妹们已经讲得很不少了。我只是提起一下不久以前，我听了有关宪法草案的报告，参加了宪法草案的讨论，我一面眼望着无限美好的将来，另一面又不能不回想起惨痛的过去。在国民党统治时期，我们演一出稍稍有一点人民气息的戏剧都要受到迫害，都要受到轻蔑，都有挨打坐牢的危险；而今天，在宪法草案上规定了“中华人民共和国保障公民进行科学研究、文学、艺术创作和其他文化活动的自由。国家对于从事科学、教育、文学、艺术和其他文化事业的公民的创造性工作，给以鼓励和帮助”。这样的话语，对于像我们这样受过双重、三重压迫的人，真是比慈母还要亲切！我不能不感谢共产党，没有共产党就没有这样的宪法！
    我觉得，这个宪法是中国人民幸福生活的保证，这个宪法也是中国文学艺术走向繁荣的保证。
    解放五年来，国家对我们戏曲事业已经给了很大的鼓励、关怀和帮助，在党和政府的领导下，我们曾做了一些工作，但是从客观要求，从人民群众对我们的期待来看，毫无疑问，我们的工作是做得十分不够的。中国人民在共产党的领导之下，已经胜利地完成了人民民主革命，已经胜利地进入了社会主义改造，即社会主义革命的过渡时期。可是我们的戏曲工作，不论在剧本的思想水平和艺术水平上，在表演的方法上，在剧团的制度上，在演员的生活态度和艺术态度上，依然还停留在前一个时期的阶段。我们还没有树立起明确的社会主义思想，我们还没有很好地贯彻为社会主义建设服务的方针，我们在艺术上也还有很多保守思想，很少突破旧形式旧制度，来作演出现代题材的尝试。拿我们越剧工作来说，在一部分人中间也还有故步自封、不求上进的现象，这样我们的工作就有一天天落后于新的生活、落后于群众要求的危险。各位代表，对于国家对我们的鼓励和支持，一方面我们感到光荣，另一方面我们也感到责任的重大。由于我们越剧还是年轻的剧种，我们有改革的决心，所以我可以在这里向大家保证，决心同一切要求进步的戏曲工作者在一起，为实现社会主义，为创造新内容新形式的民族戏曲艺术贡献出自己的全部力量。
    陈汝棠代表的发言主席、各位代表、各位同志：
    中央人民政府公布了中华人民共和国宪法草案之后，全国人民都为自己的国家将有真正民主的宪法而欢欣鼓舞。特别是我们这一辈，在过去的反动统治下曾经奋斗数十年，渴望民主宪政而不可得，如今在中国共产党领导下，获得了革命胜利，中华人民共和国成立以来仅仅五年，又获得许多新的胜利，现在标志着这种革命胜利的符合全国人民愿望的宪法就要诞生了。我在这里以充满快乐的心情，对领导中国人民走向胜利的中国共产党和毛主席表示最大的敬意。
    我们在广东省讨论宪法草案的时候，各界人士对这个宪法草案都非常满意。大家认为这个宪法草案是从全国人民利益出发，是团结全国各民族各阶层人民的最有力的武器。
    中国人民的共同愿望是要把祖国建成一个繁荣强大、和平幸福的社会主义国家，而这个宪法草案的贯彻执行，就一定能够顺利地实现中国人民的共同愿望。
    因此，我衷心地拥护这个宪法草案，希望全国人民代表大会这次会议一致通过。同时，我对刘少奇委员关于宪法草案的报告完全同意和拥护。
    我是一个人民代表，我一定效忠人民民主制度，遵守宪法和法律，努力为人民服务，并且在自己参加的工作和社会活动中，以身作则，保证宪法、法律和国家政策的实施。
    我又是民主党派成员之一，我一定尽力于以中国共产党为领导的人民民主统一战线的巩固与扩大，使人民民主统一战线在国家生活中能继续发挥其作用。但不必讳言，就广东的情况来说，过去有一些地方的确是没有很好贯彻统一战线政策的，相当严重地反映出有关部门的领导工作干部的粗糙作风与拖拉态度，既缺乏实事求是的精神，也缺乏责任心，因而在统一战线工作中发生不良影响。对于这些缺点，虽已逐步克服，但仍值得我们严重注意。今后务使大家依照宪法的原则精神，更加重视统一战线工作，更好地发挥统一战线的作用，为动员与团结全国人民完成国家在过渡时期的总任务和反对内外敌人而奋斗不懈，为维护领土的完整、解放台湾而奋斗不懈。
    丁志辉代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我这次被选为全国人民代表大会代表，感觉非常光荣，同时也觉得十分惭愧，因为我对祖国、对人民的贡献极少，国家和人民交给我的任务还没有能够很好地完成。这次的当选是国家和人民对我又一次的鼓励。我一定更虚心，更诚恳，更积极地工作和学习，用实际行动来答谢人民对我的信任和期望。
    我们祖国划时代的宪法即将在全国公布施行了，我表示衷心地拥护并在今后坚决地执行。这个宪法经过了全国人民反复的讨论，一致认为这个由伟大的人民领袖毛主席亲自领导起草的宪法，条条都是从人民利益出发的。这个宪法反映了我们中华人民共和国成立以来的现实情况，用立法形式总结了我国人民革命斗争主要的经验，把我国人民革命的伟大成果肯定了下来，并且把我国人民逐步建成社会主义社会这一个共同目的和愿望肯定了下来。今后这个宪法的实行，将保证我们逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，逐步完成对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，也就是说将保证我们的祖国建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。在不久的将来，我们的国家将要像今天的苏联那样富强，我们人民将要像今天的苏联人民那样幸福。
    我们的党和国家，对劳动人民的健康，向来是很关怀的。宪法草案的第九十二条和第九十三条规定，“劳动者有休息的权利”，“劳动者在年老、疾病或者丧失劳动能力的时候，有获得物质帮助的权利。国家举办社会保险、社会救济和群众卫生事业，并且逐步扩大这些设施，以保证劳动者享受这种权利。”我是个卫生工作者，特别感到兴奋，今后全国卫生机关和卫生人员的责任就更加重大了。
    我们祖国解放五年来，在医药卫生事业上，有了很大的发展，扩大了高级中级医药学校，大量培养医药卫生干部。全国的医院和疗养院床数，比解放前增加了五倍多（工业医疗机关不在内）。国家对少数民族地区除建立了不少的卫生机关外，还经常派遣医疗防疫队到少数民族地区工作。初步开展了妇幼卫生工作，婴儿的死亡率已有显著的降低。特别是从一九五二年开展了群众性的爱国卫生运动以来，不但粉碎了美国侵略者企图用细菌毁灭人类的阴谋，而且改善了环境卫生和个人卫生，开始树立了良好的卫生习惯，因而疾病已普遍地开始减少。但是我们绝不能满足于这些成绩。在卫生工作上还存在着不少缺点，如城市医疗机构的发展缺乏统一的组织领导，不是采取有计划的、科学的管理方法，造成医疗机构分布的不均衡，医疗任务也就形成忙闲不均，没有充分的发挥公、私医院和中、西医的潜在力量，有不少私人医院和中医闲着没有事干。同时发挥专家教授的专长也还不够，有的专家身兼五、六职，来回跑的时间化费了很多，真正接近病人的时间就很少。另外对医务人员的政治教育不深，有些技术人员还有雇佣观点，真正全心全意为人民服务的工作态度还不够。今后应该加强和改善医疗卫生机关的领导和管理，大量发挥公、私医院和中、西医疗机关的潜在力，同时要加强对技术人员的政治教育，才能更好地解决人民的治病问题。
    此外还应该加强工业卫生工作，以保证国家的工业生产。要认真学习苏联先进医学及整理和研究祖国的医学，还要提高妇幼卫生工作的质量，群众和部队的卫生工作更要经常化，不断的提高人民的健康水平。这都是我们必须努力的。国家的社会主义建设，迫切地要求我们的卫生工作不断的提高。
    我希望国家的卫生机关和全体卫生工作者勤勤恳恳，互勉互助，来完成宪法交给我们的光荣任务。
    李雪峰代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意中华人民共和国宪法草案的全部内容，完全同意刘少奇同志所作的关于宪法草案的报告。全国人民热烈地参加了宪法草案的讨论，热烈地欢呼即将通过宪法的全国人民代表大会会议的召开。这是因为这个宪法在人民民主制度的基础上，在建设社会主义社会这个目标上，集中了人民生活中最富有朝气、最有前途的东西，集中了过去几年和现在人民实践中最主要、最现实、最有价值的全部斗争成果。人民所要求的，所循以前进的正是社会主义，而决不是资本主义；正是人民民主制度，而决不是资本主义民主制度。无疑地，我们的国家制度和人民的觉悟将“保证我国能够通过和平的道路消灭剥削和贫困，建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。”
    人民的实践，总是伟大的、多方面的，也总难免会有缺点和错误的。胜利的实践，就是在马克思列宁主义的思想指导下，在中国共产党和我们国家的正确政策实际指导下，经过人民群众自己的自觉和自愿来克服缺点和错误，克服无数实际困难而实现的。任何工作决不可以设想没有缺点、没有错误，决不可以用万事大吉的态度来对待人民的事业；相反，必须用实事求是的态度、批评和自我批评的精神，来对待自己的工作，来教育人民群众。宪法草案所规定的人民民主制度体系，充分保证了这一点。
    宪法草案规定我们的国家是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家。五年来，工人阶级在实现和加强它的领导作用中，也像其他人民群众一样，大大地锻炼了它自己，壮大了它自己。它的发展，并不是风平浪静的，而是经过了广泛的阶级的自我批评，克服了行政上和其他工作上的官僚主义，并不断克服自己队伍中的若干偏见、缺点和错误，不断克服自身在组织上纪律上的松懈现象而壮大起来的。这无论是在过去工厂矿山所实行的民主改革、生产改革中，或是在实行国家计划、进行劳动竞赛、推广先进经验或推行苏联专家建议中，都充分证明了这一点。今后在实行社会主义工业化的艰巨任务中，更要大大地发展这个经验，以便充分发挥工人群众的积极性和创造性，来响应国家的每一号召，完成国家的全部计划。
    工人阶级在实现它的全部领导作用时，必须首先注意巩固工农联盟。我们国家在过去几年，已经改革了土地制度，满足了农民的土地要求，广泛地发动了农民所蕴藏的巨大革命力量；又及时地发展生产合作、供销合作和信用合作，实行粮食和其他主要农产品的计划收购与计划供应，发动了广大农民改造个体农业的热情。把农民这种力量和热情，充分地有组织地引到农业社会主义改造方面去，是今天领导农民的主要的任务。农民是有弱点的，与农民的社会主义要求同时，还存在着一种资本主义自发的倾向，富农就利用了这一弱点来进行抵抗和破坏活动，工人阶级则必须依靠农民，通过农民的自觉活动教育农民，并克服富农的抵抗，限制富农经济，以便逐步实现对农业的社会主义改造。这就要求一切农村工作者，必须坚持实例示范与耐心说服的方法，反对官僚主义和强迫命令的方法。
    官僚主义和强迫命令，在我们的国家机关和许多工作人员的实际工作中是常常容易出现和重复的，这是直接与人民民主制度精神相违反的。所以必须切实地对一切工作人员进行教育，并按宪法所规定的全部人民民主制度、特别是各级人民代表大会制度、法院制度与检察制度，保证人民的权利，以便充分发挥人民群众的积极性创造性，为逐步过渡到社会主义社会而奋斗。
    龙云代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我以无比兴奋的心情，在这庄严的全国人民代表大会会议上发言，感到万分的光荣。
    中华人民共和国成立五年以来，开展了一系列的社会改革，旧中国的面貌基本改变了，在大陆上把侵略、压迫、剥削我们的封建主义、官僚资本主义、帝国主义的势力消灭。在政治、经济、文化、军事各方面的建设，都有显著的成就。更由于外交的胜利，使我国在国际上具有崇高的声誉与地位。由于中国共产党和毛主席的领导，才获得了这样的成就，才使国家有了条件，召开这个全国人民代表大会，来制定宪法。
    宪法草案经过了全国人民广泛和详细的讨论，即将在大会上通过。我完全同意刘少奇委员的宪法草案报告。这个宪法巩固了人民革命的成果，反映了国家过渡时期的根本要求，明确规定了人民的权利和义务，明确地指出了我们奋斗的目标。这个宪法，是国家的根本大法，其实质是优越的，我们要遵守它，要切实地奉行它，我衷心表示拥护它。
    宪法草案中明确规定了少数民族在政治上、经济上、文化上一律平等，我特别感到兴奋。因为孙中山先生生前曾经主张各民族一律平等，叛徒蒋介石不但没有奉行这个政策，反而一贯对少数民族歧视与迫害，因此孙先生的愿望未能实现。今天在共产党和毛主席领导下，各民族才真正获得了平等的权利。据我所知，几年来仅以国家每年用在少数民族的教育经费一项而言，就超过反动政府时候用于全国的教育经费，这是一个具体生动的证明。并且宪法草案总纲中，明确规定了少数民族聚居的地方实行区域自治的权利，我相信等到宪法公布后，我们少数民族一定会一致地欢欣鼓舞，竭诚拥护。
    为了使今后我们的工作做得更好，应本宪法的精神，来检查过去行政上的一些缺点。我有几点希望，提供参考。例如：教育方面，由于人民的文化要求，日趋迫切，既有的学校和师资，不够满足国家建设的需要，个别地区，学生多，校舍小，教师与学生均感困难，于学生学业和健康是有影响的，希望加以改进。铁道运输方面，是获得首要成功的，但目前客运拥挤，购票困难，坐次不免紊乱，旅客颇感不便，希望主管部门，予以注意。卫生方面，群众性的爱国卫生运动，已获很大成绩，但医疗设施，还不充分，患者不无困难，希望加以改善。
    我们历来是经济落后的国家，虽然经过几年来恢复和建设，医治了战争的创伤，取得了很大的成就，但是现在抗美援朝尚未结束，台湾尚未解放，第一个五年计划正在进行，还不能百废俱兴。建设应该权衡轻重缓急，一切用度都应精简节约，严禁浪费，个别不急需的建筑，似宜稍缓，为国家积累资金，投入生产建设，使五年计划得以提早完成。
    台湾是我国领土的一部分。现在，美帝国主义和蒋贼卖国集团盘踞着台湾，坚决与中国人民为敌，不断对我国沿海骚扰与破坏，阻碍我们和平建设，这是不能容忍的。为了领土主权完整，为了祖国安全，为了保障亚洲及世界和平，我们一定要消灭蒋贼卖国集团，解放台湾。
    末了，我衷心地预祝这次全国人民代表大会会议的成功，我希望中华人民共和国宪法的顺利通过。让我们一致团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，为建设社会主义社会而奋斗。
    胡忠华代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我代表云南省佧瓦族人民，来参加第一届全国人民代表大会，觉得非常荣幸！
    佧瓦山在祖国西南边疆，那里有佧瓦族、傣族、傈僳族等四十多万人民。解放前，反动派来了就要钱，要粮，要牲口，还挑拨民族关系，所以跟内地民族就隔了一道墙，汉人不敢进去，怕杀头，我们也不敢出来，怕杀掉。那么大的一个地方，没有一所学校，没有一个医生，生产很落后，疾病又多，那些日子很难过。
    解放后，共产党毛主席派来了干部，他们跟以前的汉族统治者完全两样。他们帮助我们搞好团结，搞好生产，带来大批物资、贷款和救济款；学校办了五所，医院也设了三个，公路也修起来了。这样，生产进步了，有些地方杀人祭谷的恶习，正在改变着，有病就多半找医生吃药，不再像以前的打卦供鬼了，所以生活也在逐步改善着。现在佧瓦族人民要求政府，再多派些毛主席的人，多派些干部、医生、老师、好好帮助我们展开工作。佧瓦族人民出来开会、参观、学习的也多了，到处受到政府的优待，受到各族人民的欢迎，但我们希望政府再给我们多出来些人。
    过去，各民族之间很不团结，解放前一年，佧瓦族还跟猛定傣族打了三个月仗，死伤不少。现在大家都听毛主席的话，又相好了，又在一起工作了。过去边疆是没人保护的，现在人民解放军驻守着了，我们还组织联防队协助人民解放军，去歼灭来侵扰沧源的蒋匪残余，边疆比以前安定得多了。但是，也还受到蒋匪残余的威胁，还有特务的造谣破坏，人民还有顾虑。我们希望早日解放台湾，彻底消灭蒋匪残余，这样边疆才会进一步安定，国防才会进一步巩固，我们一定加强团结，提高警惕，协助人民解放军，支援人民解放军。
    我参加过宪法草案的讨论，现在又听了刘少奇委员的报告，我完全拥护，我们佧瓦族人民，坚决要在共产党和毛主席的领导下，进一步加强民族团结，在先进民族的帮助下，向着社会主义社会前进。
    刘宁一代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的召开，是我国历史上有划时代意义的事情，在这次会议上，我们全体代表，有一件庄严而神圣的任务，那就是庄严地通过中华人民共和国宪法。
    这个摆在我们面前的宪法草案，我认为是完全符合工人阶级的意志和愿望的。因为它总结了人民革命斗争的经验，把人民革命的胜利成果用法律形式固定下来；同时，为我们的国家规划出了一个美好的社会主义前途，我完全同意和拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案和刘少奇同志的报告。
    我深信这一宪法的通过，一定能进一步巩固和发展我国的人民民主制度。
    中国的工会组织，一直是我国人民民主政权的坚强支柱。当中华人民共和国成立以后，工会组织就展开了广泛的教育工作，以吸引我国广大的职工群众来参加国民经济的恢复和发展工作。成百万的男女工人、技术人员、职员展开了劳动竞赛，对于国民经济的恢复做出了巨大的贡献。一九五三年我国开始了第一个五年建设计划之后，劳动竞赛也有了新的发展，它正在克服着初期阶段不可避免的一些缺点，向着一个较高的阶段，即提高技术、革新技术的方向发展。劳动竞赛是一股强大的动力，它使我国国民经济以相当快的速度向前发展着。
    随着国家经济建设事业的发展，我国工人阶级的队伍也日益壮大起来。现在绝大部分工人职员群众都已参加了工会。一九四九年工会会员为数只二百三十七万三千九百三十八人，而现在达到一千一百万人。强大的工人阶级，誓以全力来贯彻宪法中所规定的：逐步消灭剥削制度，建立社会主义社会。
    在我国人民民主制度下，劳动者受到无微不至的关怀。在国民经济不断高涨的基础上，工人阶级物质文化生活水平日益提高。我国工人阶级社会政治地位的提高和物质文化生活的改善，生动地证明了人民民主制度的优越性。
    但是，目前在某些厂矿企业中还有一些消极因素存在，使我们的工作受到了不应有的损失。如某些企业中还存在着生产管理上无人负责的现象，在基本建设中由于设计施工的管理不善，致有浪费工时、浪费原料、材料的现象。由于某些企业计划管理和财务管理不善，造成积压资金、积压物资、浪费运输力量等情况也是相当普遍相当严重的。在技术管理方面由于没有妥善的技术组织措施而积压职工群众革新技术的合理化建议的现象也大量存在。所有这些不良情况，都影响到降低生产成本，造成生产中的巨大损失，违背着节约原则和经济核算原则。应当指出，这一方面表现了企业行政方面存在着官僚主义，一方面也表现了工会组织没有很好地动员群众发挥工会法所赋予的监督作用，开展反官僚主义斗争。我们必须采取各种措施，消除这些不利的因素，以提高厂矿企业的管理水平，加速社会主义工业化的进程。
    我们的宪法对于逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化的目标已有了明确具体的规定。可是我们必须克服具体工作中的缺点，才能顺利实现这个奋斗目标。具体工作中的缺点克服得愈快，工作做得愈好，宪法目标的实现的进程也就愈快愈彻底。
    工会组织保证将宪法贯彻到实际工作中去。
    罗隆基代表的发言主席、诸位代表：
    中央人民政府提出来的宪法草案是十分完善的，我完全拥护。在我投票赞成这个宪法草案以前，我愿说一点我个人对宪法的认识。
    我是一个在英美国家学过宪法学的人；我是一个在中国的大学里教过宪法学的人；我是一个曾在中国旧社会里参加过宪法运动的人；我是一个曾经受到过资本主义国家宪法理论毒害的人；并且，必须坦白地承认，我是一个曾经用过有毒素的宪法学说毒害过中国青年的人。今天的我，对宪法必须用一种新的观念，新的认识，才能代表中国人民，投票拥护中华人民共和国宪法。
    刘少奇委员在关于宪法草案的报告中说过，这个宪法草案是中国近代关于宪法问题和宪政运动历史经验的总结。我个人希望，在这次全国人民代表大会庄严地通过宪法的时候，这是全中国六万万人民，全体一致地宣告，资产阶级的宪法理论，资产阶级的宪法幻想，在中国是彻底地、干净地而且永远地结束了！
    今天中国还是一个有阶级的国家。今天在座的各位代表还是来自各个不同的阶级。事实尽管是这样，在我们投票通过宪法的时候，我们的思想只能是，而且必须是，真诚地拥护一个从新民主主义社会过渡到社会主义社会的宪法。我们必须坚决地，毫无怀疑地认定，从新民主主义社会进到社会主义社会是今天中国应当走的唯一的道路。人民民主国家要进到社会主义社会，人民民主阶级联盟中是有斗争的，是必须进行社会主义改造的。我们的宪法就是一个社会主义建设和社会主义改造的宪法。在宪法通过之后，我们应该改造的阶级诚心诚意地接受改造。有了这样的一个认识，我们才能正确地明了整个宪法的精神。这样，我们这次通过宪法，就更有伟大的历史意义。
    在我们的宪法草案公布以后，资本主义国家的杂志讥笑我们宪法草案上公民权利的保证是不具体、不切实，还赶不上苏联宪法的实际。对了，他们真对了！我们今天的宪法是赶不上苏联宪法的进步的。苏联已经是社会主义的先进的国家。我们只是学习苏联的一个新民主主义国家。我们是在跟着苏联前进的国家。普遍地抄录世界上一切宪法的好条文，把宪法装饰成一篇美丽的文章，这是中国过去反动政府制造伪宪的把戏，这是资本主义国家欺骗人民的把戏。资本主义国家的宪法，形式上宣布一大批公民权利，写得应有尽有；同时用普通立法手续剥夺广大人民这些权利，剥夺得应无尽无。今天的美国就是这样一个典型的例子。最近美国国会通过的法律，美国总统艾森豪威尔公布的法律，宣布美国共产党非法。这就是对美国宪法规定“集会结社自由”的一个大大的讽刺。这是所谓“自由世界”对人民自由一个大大的讽刺。他们的宪法是：开出了真方卖假药；挂起羊头卖狗肉！我们的宪法是：说了的必定做，实事求是，不夸张，不欺骗。这是我们宪法的特点！我们的宪法是真正民主的宪法。
    中国人民就要有一部真正民主的宪法了，这真是多大的一件喜事。这些年来，中国人民殷切地盼望国家早早制定一个宪法，并根据宪法制定一切法律。建国初期，我们打倒了封建的六法全书。在时间上和经验上我们赶不及制定新的法律。我们曾经用政府的政策做政法人员的工作方针。有些下级干部因为对政策体会得不够清楚，所以在贯彻政策的时候，就不免有了些偏差。这是事实。几年来中央人民政府曾经先后制定过一些主要的法律，不过在宣传法律上，在解释法律上，在执行法律上，有过些缺点，犯过些错误，这是事实。个别的上层负责人，不但不倡导守法精神，反以超越法律的特殊地位自居，这也是事实。这些年来，没有满足人民愿望，完全发扬法治精神，这种缺点，我们应该承认的。
    国家越是进步，法治的精神就越应该提高。我们对这样的一个观念，过去还重视得不够，对这样的工作，还努力得不够。所以几年来社会上就发生了一种轻视政法工作的观念。在旧社会里，政法工作人员太多；在新社会里，政法工作人员太少。国家对旧的政法人员，没有完全做好思想改造工作；对新的政法干部，没有完全做好业务训练工作。少数旧的政法人员，闲置失业；新的政法干部，供不应求。从前想做官的人太多；现在愿做官的人太少。一般青年学生入学选科的时候，分配到理工方面，就眉飞色舞；分配到政法方面，就垂头丧气。青年们认定：到工厂是前程远大；进机关，进政法机关就是末路穷途。这个观念，毫无问题，是错误的。国家没有好的政法人员，没有好的政法工作，国家就不可能有好的宪政，不可能有真的法治。国家现在要通过宪法，实行宪政，这种现象就必须及时加以纠正。
    国家马上就有一个根本法了！依据这个根本法制定国家应有的法律，提高国家法治的水平，这就是最高国家权力机关的责任，这就是我们在座代表们的责任。我们必须在毛主席领导之下把这个责任完全担负起来！
    诸位代表，现在六万万人民正殷切地等待着我们通过中华人民共和国宪法！
    这个宪法是符合国家当前的要求的！
    这个宪法是符合全国人民的利益的！
    这个宪法是符合全国人民的愿望的！
    这个宪法，必定能够动员中国人民，团结中国人民，武装中国人民，使中国人民欢欣鼓舞地向前迈进，顺利地而且胜利地进到繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。
    范文澜代表的发言
    中华人民共和国宪法草案和刘少奇同志关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告，我都完全同意，完全拥护。我建议我们的大会一致通过这个伟大的宪法。
    中国人民得到这个宪法是经历过极其艰难曲折的路程的。一百多年来，中国人民的敌人--帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义结合成强大的反革命势力，它硬要把中国拖进殖民地的深渊里去。中国人民是有长远的革命传统和坚强的反抗精神的，决不允许中国变成殖民地。这样，中国人民就对反革命势力展开了激烈的、长期的斗争，用无数英雄的鲜血写下中国的近一百多年的历史。
    中国人民前仆后继地进行着斗争，目标之一，就是要争取民主的权利。辛亥革命曾经产生过有进步意义的、代表人民意志的临时约法，但不久就被袁世凯撕毁了。历史证明，不彻底推翻反革命的统治，中国人民永远不会得到民主权利。中国人民只有在中国共产党领导下，才能战胜反革命势力，取得革命的伟大胜利，实现真正的人民民主政治。
    一九四九年中华人民共和国宣告成立，标志着人民革命的胜利，共同纲领就是这个胜利的记录。中国人民革命的成就以高速度发展着，建国以来政治上经济上的新胜利以及国家在过渡时期的根本要求和广大人民建设社会主义社会的共同愿望，都需要用宪法的形式把它巩固起来，并且在这个巩固了的基础上，以更高的速度向伟大的社会主义社会迈进。
    我们国家各个方面进步都很巨大，今后的进步一定会更加巨大，这是无容置疑的。不过，历史遗留下来的落后现象，在许多方面还是存在着。就以历史科学部门来说，中国近代史特别是中国现代史，革命的经验教训极端丰富。如果史学工作者能够运用马克思列宁主义的观点和方法，很好地把革命历史整理出来，对中国文化建设会有很大的用处。可是，像我们这样算是学习历史的人，许多年来就没有做出过像些样子的工作，按照工作上所需要的质量和数量来看，简直落后得可怕。虽然一般史学工作者都在努力，不一定都缺少成绩，但史学界的落后现象不能说不存在。
    落后是进步的绊脚石。也就是所有落后的东西，对宪法实施都要起一定的障碍作用。我们必须和它作不断的斗争，首先要克服自己思想上的落后成分。我们国家的事业发展得那样快，只许我们前进，决不许我们后退。国家要求我们努力工作，那么殷切，有什么理由还舍不得放弃落后的东西！
    我们的先烈，从一百多年前到现在，一直在付出自己宝贵的生命来保证革命的胜利和国家的安全，我们也必须抱同样的精神来保证把自己的工作做好，做得更好。宪法上规定的一切，我们必须严格遵守，以实际行动来实现宪法上的一切规定。我是一个缺乏工作能力的人，人民授权给我，叫我光荣地在大会上投票拥护宪法，我十分感奋！我愿意在大会前面，表示我的决心，保证永远效忠人民民主制度，服从宪法和法律，努力为人民服务。
    李维光代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    中华人民共和国宪法草案，经过全国人民的反复讨论和中央人民政府委员会的修正通过，刘少奇委员又作了详尽的解释报告，我们天主教友对这部宪法表示完全同意和衷心拥护。因为这部宪法是反映了全国人民的根本要求和共同愿望，也是我们天主教友的愿望。
    我们天主教的基本教义是“上爱天主下爱人”，而爱天主的准绳是以爱人的尺度来衡量的，就是除了仪式的敬礼外，具体的表现是在全心全力爱人，就是牺牲自己，为人类造福。因此，不能爱人，不能为人类造福，依据教义讲，他的爱天主是虚伪的，不被天主所接受的，因而也得不到身后的天堂。正如宪法上规定我们走向繁荣幸福的社会主义社会，为人民服务，以人民的利益为最高的、唯一的目的是完全一致的。
    宪法草案在公民的基本权利中规定，不分宗教信仰都是一律平等，第八十八条更说明了我们能够充分地享受宗教信仰的自由。几年来，我们南京教区各个本堂区的神父，都是自由地举行宗教仪式和进行传教活动，每个教友也都是过着愉快的宗教生活。有人认为“新中国是没有宗教信仰自由的”、
  “天主教是被人歧视的”，这种说法是荒谬的，这是帝国主义分子蓄意破坏人民内部团结的一种挑拨行为。从我们天主教中的神职人员和教友这次被当选为全国人民代表大会代表这一事实来看，也有力地说明了政府和人民对我们天主教是同别的宗教一样看待，没有丝毫歧视。政府和人民所要求我们的，就是希望中国天主教会不为帝国主义所利用，如同世界各国的天主教会一样，由本国的神职人员自己来办理自己的教会，除此以外，没有其他要求。至于对教会的圣统、法规、信仰以及教会组织与行政，丝毫不加干涉，对教会的财产和经济，也予以保护。过去这样，现在宪法中也把它固定下来了。
    但也不能否认，个别地方政府对中央规定的宗教政策，还有一些没有全部贯彻的。这是时间问题，而不是原则问题。同时，在这些地方至今还有少数神职人员未能尽好爱国的职责，并有阻止教友参加各项爱国活动，这也是必须改进的。因此，我祈望全国的神职人员和教友，毅然决然地站立起来，积极参加祖国各项建设事业，尽好公民应尽的义务。这样，政府的宗教政策，就能更顺利地贯彻了。
    解放后的几年以来，从我自己的亲身体验中感到，人民政府能处处开诚相见，愿与我们天主教人团结合作，共同建设祖国。为了不辜负全国人民的期望，我愿忠诚地遵守宪法和法律，并在实际行动中贡献我应尽的力量。我也希望全国的神职人员和教友，共同遵守宪法和法律，在人民政府的领导下，团结一致，搞好爱国爱教工作，我相信，我们的教会是有光明前途的。
    最后敬祝大会胜利成功。
    韦国清代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议已在首都庄严地开幕了。在会议中，听了刘少奇同志关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告，我们认为：这个宪法是总结了中国人民革命胜利的成果，反映了各族人民的共同愿望，充分体现了我国民族平等的政策，使各族人民都有一个光明、美好的前途。因此，我们表示完全同意并衷心的拥护即将通过的宪法和刘少奇同志的报告。
    我能以僮族人民代表的身份参加全国人民代表大会并能在这里发言，感到极大的光荣。
    生活在祖国南方广大地区的僮族人民，仅在广西省境内就有六百五十多万。但提起僮族这个民族，可能有些代表同志感到比较生疏。这是因为什么呢？这是由于过去反动统治阶级一贯执行大民族主义政策，用各种残暴的手段，企图消灭僮族的民族特征，极力地否认僮族存在的客观事实，以达到他们统治掠夺的目的，使僮族人民在政治上没有地位，经济上陷于贫困，文化上被摧残，并因此造成了同其他民族之间的隔阂和仇视。这都是过去反动统治阶级的民族压迫政策所造成的恶果。
    僮族人民和国内其他兄弟民族一样，是一个勇敢、勤劳、朴实而有自己悠久历史的民族。在民族民主革命运动中，僮族人民曾经和各族人民一起，在中国共产党的领导下，进行了坚决的斗争。在一九二九年至一九三○年期间，曾建立了自己的革命政权和革命军队，建立了广大地区的革命根据地，其后并坚持了长期的革命斗争。解放后，民族压迫制度被摧毁了，在中国共产党的民族政策的光辉照耀下，僮族人民得到了同各兄弟民族一样的平等地位，成立了桂西僮族自治区，实现了当家作主的政治权利。我们僮族人民衷心地感谢中国共产党，感谢各族人民伟大的领袖毛主席！
    经过几年来的工作，民族隔阂基本上已消除了，僮族人民和汉族及其他兄弟民族人民已亲密地团结在一起，特别是经过了民主改革和区域自治工作以后，民族团结更加增强了。僮族人民在进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造过程中得以充分发挥了智慧，政治热情和生产积极性大大地提高了。在人民政府的扶助和关怀下，农村中已开展了互助合作运动，改进了农作方法，增加了生产，使人民生活得到初步改善。这一切，充分证明了中国共产党民族政策的伟大和正确。现在，宪法更把民族平等政策加以巩固，并以法律形式固定下来。我们今后将遵守和奉行宪法的规定，继续地防止和克服地方民族主义思想，向先进民族学习，同时也要防止和克服僮族中尚存在的大民族主义思想，尊重其他兄弟民族的地位和权利，在统一的祖国大家庭中，加强团结，努力发展生产，积极支援国家社会主义工业化的建设；在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的领导下，同各族人民一道，为逐步过渡到社会主义社会而奋斗。
    费广泰代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    中华人民共和国宪法的制定，是我国人民政治生活中一件大事。这个宪法把我国人民在中国共产党、毛主席的英明领导下英勇奋斗的全部革命成果，用法律形式固定下来，同时充分表达了我国逐步过渡到社会主义社会的根本要求和广大人民建设社会主义社会的共同愿望和责任，指出了为实现这个要求而奋斗的正确道路。它的每一条文，每一字句，都完全体现了我国人民的利益，是动员和鼓舞全国人民积极参加社会主义改造事业的有力武器，是我国能够通过和平道路，消灭剥削和贫困，建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会的充分保证。我们对于这样一部关系到每个人切身利益的中华人民共和国的根本大法的制定，感到衷心喜悦，所以表示热烈拥护这部宪法草案和刘少奇委员的宪法草案报告。
    我是一个煤矿工作者。回忆在旧社会的时期，学采矿的人，就业非常困难。原因就是我国的大矿都被帝国主义者霸占，小矿为官僚资本者所有，地下蕴藏虽富，国家并不开采。而帝国主义者对于中国技术人员特别轻视，无论有无本领，就是不用。据我了解，在伪满时期，东北几个大矿里的技术人员，没有一个是中国人。在国民党统治下，专讲门径、宗派及社会关系，所以也很难以立足。因此学采矿的人感觉悲观失望，个别的流入别途了。
    自从一九四九年解放后，社会由黑暗转向光明，新民主主义制度实现了，大规模经济建设的第一个五年计划正在进行并已取得显著成绩，矿藏资源为全民所有，劳动就业为公民权利，科学研究为国家重视，特别是在宪法草案第六条、第九十一条及第九十五条都已明文规定了，这些规定都是中国有史以来闻所未闻的事情。
    宪法草案第二十七条第九款规定，全国人民代表大会决定国民经济计划，这一规定，完全符合广大群众的迫切要求。几年来我们在计划工作方面，确已取得相当成绩，但是我们作的非常不够。以煤矿计划而论，可以包括生产、基本建设二种，几年来生产、基本建设任务虽然不断提高，但是，在生产方面年初计划大都是保守的，以后总是增加的，在基本建设方面年初大都是冒进，以后总是削减的，因此一系列的计划布置工作未完而修改计划到了，修改计划的布置未完，再修改计划又到了，于是一年之中总作计划，总改计划，造成基层职工盲无所从，失去奋斗的目标。况且基建是保证完成生产的先行工程，如不很好的配合进行，将来会造成技术政策中的严重错误。所以建议掌握计划的各级部门，要预计国家需要，每年制出切实可行的决定性的国家经济计划。
    宪法草案第九十一条载国民经济有计划的发展，逐步扩大劳动就业，改善劳动条件等规定。在煤矿之中威胁最甚的是天然瓦斯，只本年内全国煤矿瓦斯爆炸事故约已有十余次发生。因此建议燃料工业部对于三级以上的瓦斯矿井应该明确规定必须先排瓦斯次掘进后采煤的工作程序，以防瓦斯爆炸，而又改善劳动条件，同时可为拥护宪法之具体表现。我感到这一部宪法草案经过全国人民广泛的讨论，吸收人民正确的意见，多次修改，尽善尽美，是真正名符其实的人民民主宪法，我除建议大会通过外，并愿以非常愉快的心情和实际的行动，协助宪法的实施，保证作到以下条件：
    一、遵守宪法并宣传宪法。
    二、爱护国家资源并研究合理开采国家资源。
    三、在工作中以理论与实际相结合的精神，同职工群众密切团结，互相讨论，互相研究，解决工作中的关键问题，在安全的条件下不断地提高生产。
    丁颖代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    听到刘少奇委员关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告，我认为是完全正确的，对于这一部宪法，我谨表示热烈的拥护。
    这部宪法是国家过渡时期的宪法，要在这个时期逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化和对农业、手工业与资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。我国是小农经济比重很大的农业国，要完成农业的社会主义改造，是一个极其复杂而艰巨的事情。年来共产党和人民政府在农村中做了不少深入的工作，以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动大大地展开了。跟着而来的，关于农业增产的科学技术上的要求，也就非常迫切，农业科学技术必须配合着农业合作化运动和国家社会主义工业化的需要而向前发展。我们科学工作者，特别是农业科学技术工作者，必须把这个艰巨而光荣的责任担当起来。
    就华南来说，当前的主要任务，是增加农业生产，特别是增产粮食，以支援国家工业化。华南地处热带和亚热带，农业资源特别丰富，天然条件与华中、华北不同，可以相互调剂，并有它本身的特别优点，像对于水、旱、风、冻和目前带有严重性的病虫害，根据各地劳动人民的实际经验和苏联先进的科学技术，都可以设法防止。例如广东原是豪雨地带，但由于山区近海，潦水排泄较易，一般连续浸害不过一周；又如广东也常常患旱，但在主要作物需水季节，普遍地整月无雨的现象并不多见，且湿度仍在七八十度之间，这就有可能从较小的水利工程及改进耕作法、选种法等各方面加以有效的调整，来使生产在稳定的基础上逐步提高。事实上广东在国民党反动统治时代，为全国著名的缺粮省份，每年缺粮多则十亿斤以上，少则数亿斤。但解放以来，由于党和人民政府的正确领导，农民积极的互助合作，争取增产，已使全省粮食可以自给，且有部分余粮调出省外。今年八月在广东省第一届人民代表大会第一次会议中，全省各县代表满怀信心地承担了国家对广东提出的增产粮食的要求，保证到一九五七年比一九五二年增产稻谷到百分之五十。我们农业科学技术工作者应该认真负起应有的责任，从稳定生产和逐步提高的农业技术改革上积极帮助农民，把理论与实际、技术与劳动紧密结合起来，把国家计划增产以至超额增产的可能变成现实。并应努力把热带和亚热带特产的工业原料与出口物资的产量大大提高，以配合国家工业化的要求。
    宪法草案第九十五条规定国家保障公民进行科学研究的自由，对于从事科学教育等创造性的工作给以鼓励和帮助。回忆解放之前，许多科学技术工作者学非所用，无法坚持研究工作，甚至无法维持生活，这同今天重视科学、奖励科学研究的宪法正是强烈的对比。这更使我相信全国科学工作者今后一定能够遵循宪法所指示的途径，在国家日益完整的增产计划的指导下，同广大劳动人民群众团结在一起，为发展我国的科学事业，为发展工农业生产，为完成国家工业化的光荣任务而奋斗！
    谢雪红代表的发言主席团、各位代表：
    我首先表示拥护刘少奇委员关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告，并且完全拥护这个宪法，同时也建议大会一致通过这个宪法。
    我是一个台湾人。台湾尚在美国侵占之下，尚在蒋介石卖国集团罪恶统治之下，台湾人民没有机会参加这个宪法草案的讨论，没有机会选出他们应有的代表来参加这个大会。但广大的善良的台湾人民的心，是热烈地向着这个大会的，渴望着祖国同胞去迅速解放台湾。我觉得，在全国人民代表大会会议讨论这个宪法草案的时候，我很高兴以台湾人的心情发表我的意见。
    台湾是中国不可分割的领土，中华人民共和国是台湾人民亲爱的祖国，台湾人都是中国人。祖国这个宪法所反映的我国人民革命的成果，其中也包括了台湾人民长期英勇革命斗争的部分。宪法所反映的中国人民的共同愿望，也就是台湾八百万人民日夜梦寐以求的愿望。我相信，台湾人民只要看到这个宪法，一定同全国人民一样的欢欣鼓舞，完全赞成和衷心拥护这个宪法，并因此会大大增强他们为解放台湾而斗争的勇气和信心。
    在美国侵占和蒋介石卖国集团统治之下，台湾人民被美蒋剥夺了像这个宪法中所规定的公民的基本权利，没有选举权和被选举权，没有言论、出版、集会、结社、游行、示威的自由，越来越多的人丧失劳动的权利而失业，越来越多的人日益贫困失去物质生活的起码保障，甚至随时可以被逮捕并失去生存的权利。但是他们不能自由离开台湾。人在痛苦的时候呼喊母亲，在苦难中的台湾人民只有呼喊祖国。台湾人民除了自身团结一致与黑暗势力进行不断的斗争而外，尤其渴望祖国把他们从水深火热中拯救出来，迫切希望同祖国大陆上的同胞一起，来过幸福的生活，共同建设繁荣富强的祖国。
    台湾自古以来就是中国的领土，“开罗宣言”和“波茨坦公告”都明确规定台湾属于中国，决不容许美国侵占，决不容许联合国托管。台湾人民对于“中华人民共和国各民主党派各人民团体为解放台湾联合宣言”衷心拥护和感激。我们台湾人民，一定继承先烈的革命的光荣传统，加强团结，积蓄力量，准备配合人民解放军解放台湾。台湾同胞爱国之心决不后人，当李鸿章签订马关条约的时候，台湾人民曾发出檄文说：不论在车上船上，在街道上，在旅馆内或衙门内，只要碰到卖国贼李鸿章，台湾人民一定把他杀死，以谢天地祖宗。今天，台湾人民痛恨卖国贼蒋介石，比当时痛恨李鸿章强烈百倍，一定要把蒋介石归案法办，以平全国人民之愤恨。台湾同胞，不辞任何牺牲，誓和祖国同胞一道，团结任何可以团结的人，为解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团而奋斗到底。
    刘国钧代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议开幕了，这是全国人民的一件大喜事，我衷心地向大会祝贺。听了刘少奇委员关于宪法草案的报告，我完全赞同，并认为这部宪法，既巩固了革命以来的胜利成果，又指出了今后全国人民前进的意愿。我同全国人民一样，以最高的热诚来欢迎这部宪法的公布。
    我们江苏省工商界，经过去年关于国家在过渡时期总路线的学习，和今年宪法草案讨论后，认识到资本主义是不合理的制度，是没有前途的，必须加以改造。私营工商业者，通过社会主义的改造，就能够一定有他的光明前途。我们明确了这个方向，都感到愉快了。
    拿南通大生纺织厂和常州大成纺织染厂来说，自实行公私合营后，生产关系改变了，工人群众生产情绪空前提高。因而，生产力大大提高了，二十支棉纱产量锭扯增加到一磅三以上，次布率减少到百分之一左右，用棉量减少到三百八十多斤，一百九十号士林蓝布次布率减少到百分之三左右，减少了浪费，提高了品质，降低了成本，其面貌焕然一新。这就证明了国家资本主义的优越性，比资本主义国家的办法好得多了。我相信，到建成社会主义社会的时候，生产率还要比现在高得多。
    按我们江苏全省较大的私营工厂约有两千多家，现在只有六十家工厂实行公私合营。照已经实行合营的情形看来，公股代表对于领导人事安排、资产估算等等都能开诚相处，私股方面都非常满意，最近公布的“公私合营工业企业暂行条例”，明确规定了盈余分配等办法，保证了资方应得的利润，我相信其他许多中小型工厂一定能很乐意地跟上来。同时，我建议，政府以后对公私合营的厂，还要同过去一样，事前多做好各项准备工作，这样必能达到更好的效果，更能使工商业家放胆争取公私合营，大踏步地向国家资本主义的道路前进，使工商业的社会主义改造，加速完成。
    我们私营工商业者，大部分经过宪法草案的讨论后，心里明亮了。但还有一小部分存在着很多顾虑，极端自私自利的思想没有解决，在加工订货中，有偷工减料者，有消极抵抗者，甚至有偷税漏税、抽逃资金者。今后应继续加强对他们的教育，使他们在思想上行动上逐步地得到改造，从而乐意接受改造，通过国家资本主义的光明大道前进。
    胡克实代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我衷心地拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案和刘少奇同志关于宪法草案的报告。
    我们的宪法是我国人民革命斗争胜利的结晶。对于正在成长中的少年儿童一代来说，宪法带给他们的好处最多，他们将长远地享受宪法所巩固下来的革命成果；在为宪法的彻底实施的伟大斗争中，他们将成为光荣的社会主义的建设者和保卫者。
    五年来，随着我国建设事业飞跃的发展，国家给少年儿童带来了巨大的幸福。现在，在中学和小学里读书的少年儿童有五千四百多万人，超过了解放前最高数字的一倍；向少年儿童进行共产主义教育的群众组织--中国少年先锋队已有近千万的队员；少年儿童的校外教育机关和文化活动场所也在逐年增加；对少年儿童的关怀逐渐成了社会的新风气。在中国的历史上，还从来没有像中国共产党和人民政府这样关怀和重视过少年儿童。
    少年儿童是我们国家最宝贵的财富，是我们社会主义事业的接班人，是在明天使我们祖国更加美好、更加伟大的创造力量。他们必须健壮、活泼、勇敢、诚实，他们必须努力学习新的知识和富有创造精神，成为社会主义的新人。这是国家对于下一代的要求，是全体人民的利益。我相信，这也是每一个父母对于自己子女的殷切的期望。
    宪法明确规定保护和教养少年儿童是国家的责任，这就告诉我们保护和教养少年儿童是一个人人有责的全民的事业。现在我国的少年儿童有一亿多人，要把这一代教养好，是一件既光荣而又巨大的任务。在这方面学校负有主要的责任，少年先锋队也应加强自己的工作。我们要努力提高教育质量，通过课堂和各种活动，增进儿童的知识，培养他们热爱祖国、热爱集体、热爱劳动的高尚的思想感情，帮助他们锻炼身体和养成良好的生活习惯，使他们获得智、德、体、美的全面发展。在这一事业中，千万个教师和辅导员的工作将得到广大人民的尊敬和支持。但是培养教育少年儿童，仅仅依靠学校和少年先锋队的工作还是不够的，整个社会和每个家庭都负有责任。父母们不仅在工作岗位上要做模范，而且应当做自己孩子的好教师。一切国家机关、人民团体和各界人士不仅要积极地为少年儿童创设各种学习和文化活动的条件，而且要注意同旧社会遗留下来的损害少年儿童身心健康的不良现象作斗争。现在，有些地方发现有残害少年儿童的严重案件，我们认为对那些犯罪分子应该给以应有的制裁。
    我们的宪法为少年儿童的健全成长提供了一切的可能，我们应当好好培养教育新的一代，为保证我们祖国的未来而共同努力。
    马坚代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我是一个回族的教育工作者，在国民党反动统治时代，像我这样的人是决不能参与“党国”大事的。现在，中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席正确的领导下，已打倒了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义，取得了人民革命的伟大胜利，全国人民获得了解放，劳动人民获得了翻身，我国各民族人民已经团结成为一个自由平等的民族大家庭。今天，我以全国人民代表大会代表的身份参加中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，我感觉到无比的荣幸。
    中华人民共和国宪法是中国人民丰富的革命经验和建设经验的总结，而且反映了国家在过渡时期的根本要求和广大人民建设社会主义社会的共同愿望。我对于中国人民的第一个宪法表示热烈的拥护，对于刘少奇委员的报告表示完全同意。
    宪法以明文规定宗教信仰自由，民族一律平等，民族区域自治，地方各级人民代表大会在本行政区域内保障少数民族的平等权利，这是十分正确而且周到的。宪法规定各民族都有使用和发展自己的语言文字的自由，又规定各民族公民都有用本民族的语言文字进行诉讼的权利。这也是非常正确的。今后，各少数民族，除使用和发展本民族的语言文字外，为了学习汉族老大哥的先进经验和高度文化，为了加强民族间的友爱互助，他们将自觉自愿地努力学习汉族的语言文字，这是毫无疑问的。
    自中华人民共和国成立以来，我们的宗教信仰是完全自由的。美帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团的种种无耻谰言是不攻自破的。人民政府规定在伊斯兰教的三大节日各放假半天，以便信仰伊斯兰教各民族的人民欢度自己的节日，这是对于我们的风俗习惯的尊重和照顾，我们非常感激，因为这是反动统治时代所没有而且不可能有的事情。
    五年以来，共产党和毛主席对于少数民族的生活习惯，特别关怀。凡有回民参加学习或者参加工作的学校、机关、企业、工厂、矿场，大半已设有清真伙食；召开各种会议的时候，饮食上对于我们也有特别的照顾。但是还有些地方的回民学生和回民工人，还感觉不便，如大连医学院和淮安中学的学生，鹤岗的煤矿工人，就反映过他们在伙食上所遭遇的困难。今后，分配高等学校新生和毕业生的时候，如果把同一专业的回民学生成批地分配到某些学校和企业去，同时给以特别的指示，那么，领导干部就不会以人数太少为借口，而强调困难，不给他们设立清真伙食了。将来实行兵役制的时候，希望注意这个问题。
    我们回族人民唯一的问题，是城乡中广大的小商贩的转业问题，他们都愿意从新民主主义社会过渡到社会主义社会，但是他们还没有买到“船票”。怎样使这些成千成万的回民小贩得登彼岸，我相信人民政府一定会有一个周密的计划的。
    常常有回民青年向我提出一个关于回民风俗习惯的问题，我愿意在这里给他们一个公开的答复。他们问我：倘若回民青年抛去了回族的风俗习惯，他还算回民不算？我的答复是肯定的。因为他的祖先是回族，在填表的时候，如果他在民族栏里填
  “回族”二字，他并不违法。同样的，假若有一个汉民青年，自愿地采取了回民的风俗习惯，在填表的时候，他在民族栏里填写“汉族”二字，他也不违法。从理论说来，当然是这样的。倘若从事实说来，情况就不相同了。因为回民青年抛去了回民的风俗习惯后，一定会脱离回民群众的。因此，我诚恳地希望全国的回民青年，在党和人民政府的正确领导下，在思想改造上和工作作风上力求进步，同时联系广大的回民群众，带着他们一道进步，把他们带到繁荣幸福、无限美好的社会主义社会去。
    李明扬代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    首先我要衷心地感谢全国人民敬爱的领袖毛主席，感谢伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党，感谢英雄的中国人民解放军。因为没有他们，我们不可能取得反帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的胜利；没有他们，我们不可能建立独立、民主、自由的中华人民共和国；没有他们，我们不可能制定这个完全符合国家人民利益的宪法；没有他们，我们不可能建成繁荣幸福的社会主义的新社会。
    我们的宪法是人民的、民主的、科学的、进步的宪法。宪法草案第二条规定“中华人民共和国的一切权力属于人民。”广大群众认为我们的宪法草案是“幸福生活的保证”、“每一条都代表着人民的利益”，所以是人民的宪法。我们的宪法在讨论和修改的过程中，凡中华人民共和国人民，不分阶级、性别、种族、职业等，每一个人都可以参加讨论，每一个人都可以发表自己的意见，而且最后还须经全国人民选出的全国人民代表大会通过，所以是民主的宪法。我们的宪法是在总结历史经验的基础上，依据目前社会经济、政治、文化各方面的具体情况和条件，确定今后奋斗的目标和任务，因此是从实际出发的，是正确的，是行得通的，所以是科学的宪法。马克思早已指出：社会主义社会必取资本主义社会而代之，这是社会发展的规律，我们的宪法草案序言明白规定：保证我国能够通过和平的道路消灭剥削和贫困，建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。很显然，这是比现存的资本主义前进了一大步。自从以苏联为首的和平民主力量日益壮大起来以后，开始扭转了世界历史发展的方向，即由野蛮的战争时代转变为和平共处的时代。我们的宪法草案序言中，规定“我国坚定不移的方针是为世界和平和人类进步的崇高目的而努力。”又说明我们的宪法是合乎历史发展新的方向的。我们知道，合乎社会历史发展规律的就是进步的，所以是进步的宪法。总之，我们的宪法是崭新的、完美的、妥善的宪法，因此，我完全同意和拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案，及刘少奇委员关于宪法草案的报告，并建议大会正式通过我国这个人民宪法。
    在全国人民的热烈期望中，大会即将通过中华人民共和国宪法草案了，今后的问题是如何贯彻实行。当然这是全国同胞的共同责任，而我们代表又有更大的责任。我保证在毛主席和中国共产党的英明领导下，忠心耿耿地遵守并奉行宪法的每一条文，更愿为宪法每一条文的实现贡献出我所有的精力。（附图片）
