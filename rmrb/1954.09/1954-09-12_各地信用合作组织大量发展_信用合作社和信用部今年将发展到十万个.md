    [This Newspaper Dispatches] Since the China People's Bank headquarters convened a rural credit cooperative symposium between February and March this year, the People's Banks in major regions and provinces have generally convened meetings under the leadership of the local Party committees, summarizing and reviewing credit cooperative work, and formulating plans for developing credit cooperative organizations. Recently, the China People's Bank headquarters convened a meeting of branch presidents from various provinces to study the plans of various regions; the national plan for developing credit cooperative organizations this year has been largely determined. By the end of this year, the number of credit cooperatives and credit departments nationwide may reach about 100,000.
    In the first half of this year, various regions have trained more than 70,000 credit cooperative cadres and developed a large number of credit cooperative organizations. According to incomplete statistics from the China People's Bank headquarters, by the end of the second quarter, more than 42,000 credit cooperatives, more than 42,000 credit mutual aid groups, and more than 3,200 credit departments established in supply and marketing cooperatives have been established nationwide. Among them, the number of credit cooperatives has increased by 3.5 times compared with the end of last year.
    After the autumn harvest this year, various regions will vigorously establish credit cooperative organizations in coordination with the development of the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement. At present, various regions are strengthening leadership over credit cooperative work and actively carrying out preparatory work such as propaganda and cadre training. In the East China region alone, more than 39,000 credit cooperative cadres are planned to be trained in the second half of this year. Lanxi, Baiquan, Yian, Shangzhi and other counties in Heilongjiang Province recently held training courses for credit cooperative cadres. More than 180 district and village cadres participated in the training course in Lanxi County; the content of the study was divided into several aspects, such as the role and tasks of credit cooperatives during the transition period and basic business knowledge of credit cooperatives. The credit cooperative cadre training class held in Linxia Special District, Gansu Province, was attended by cadres and credit mutual aid group leaders from five ethnic groups including Hui, Han, Dongxiang, Baoan, and Tu. Pingliang Special District in the province has now trained 181 credit cooperative cadres and has begun preparations to establish credit cooperatives after the autumn harvest. Since mid-July, more than 60 counties in Guizhou Province, including Zunyi and Renhuai, have trained a total of more than 2,200 credit cooperative cadres in conjunction with the training of agricultural production cooperative cadres. At present, the cadre training work in counties such as Xingyi, Panxian, and Majiang has ended, and propaganda and mobilization work for the establishment of credit cooperative organizations is underway.

    各地信用合作组织大量发展
    信用合作社和信用部今年将发展到十万个
    【本报讯】从今年二月到三月间中国人民银行总行召开农村信用合作座谈会议以后，各大区和省的人民银行一般都在当地党委领导下召开会议，总结和检查了信用合作工作，制订了发展信用合作组织的计划。最近中国人民银行总行召开各省分行行长会议，对各地的计划进行了研究；全国今年发展信用合作组织的计划，已经大体确定。到今年年底，全国的信用合作社及信用部可发展到十万个左右。
    今年上半年，各地已经训练了七万多名信用合作干部，发展了大批信用合作组织。根据中国人民银行总行不完全的统计，到第二季度末，全国已建立信用合作社四万二千多个，信用互助组四万二千余个，设在供销合作社的信用部有三千二百多个。其中信用合作社比去年年底增加了三点五倍。
    今年秋后，各地将配合农业生产互助合作运动的发展，大力建立信用合作组织。目前，各地正加强对信用合作工作的领导，积极进行宣传和训练干部等准备工作。仅华东区，今年下半年就准备训练信用合作干部三万九千多人。黑龙江省兰西、拜泉、依安、尚志等县最近举办了信用合作干部训练班。兰西县参加训练班的区、村干部，有一百八十多人；学习的内容分信用合作社在过渡时期的作用和任务、信用合作社基本业务知识等几个方面。甘肃省临夏专区举办的信用合作干部训练班，有回、汉、东乡、保安、土族等五个民族的干部和信用互助组组长参加了学习。该省平凉专区现在已经训练信用合作干部一百八十一人，并开始进行筹备工作，准备在秋后建立信用合作社。贵州省遵义、仁怀等六十多个县从七月中旬以后，结合训练农业生产合作社干部，共训练信用合作干部二千二百多人。目前，兴义、盘县、麻江等县训练干部的工作已经结束，正在进行建立信用合作组织的宣传发动工作。
