Xinhua News Agency, 10th: The People's Liberation Army units have successfully completed the propaganda and discussion of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China.

The land, sea, and air forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army universally conducted propaganda and discussion of the draft constitution from June to August. The leading organs of all units attached great importance to the propaganda and discussion of the draft constitution and made thorough arrangements and organization. During the discussions, all units put forward opinions on revising and supplementing the draft constitution.

The propaganda and discussion of the draft constitution greatly inspired the land, sea, and air forces to defend the achievements of the people's revolution and national construction, to defend the motherland's territory, and to resolutely liberate Taiwan. The cadres and soldiers of all units conducted in-depth study and discussion of Article 20 of the draft constitution in particular, and, in connection with their own tasks, put forward directions for future efforts. Cadres and soldiers of a certain unit of the East China Military Region Navy said: The draft constitution stipulates a glorious task for us, and we must work harder to improve our combat skills and be ready to strike at the Chiang Kai-shek bandit warships that come to harass us at any time. After discussing the draft constitution, the cadres and soldiers of all units strengthened their sense of discipline and law-abidingness, and carried forward the tradition of supporting the government and cherishing the people. Several units stationed in minority areas of the Southwest Military Region and the Northwest Military Region seriously conducted a discipline inspection to ensure better implementation of the ethnic policy. Many cadres and soldiers also wrote letters while discussing the draft constitution, mobilizing their families in rural areas to participate in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, work hard in production, and support the struggle for national construction and the liberation of Taiwan.

After propagandizing and discussing the draft constitution, the broad masses of cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army generally expressed that they would support the draft constitution with practical actions to fulfill the glorious responsibilities and obligations stipulated in the draft constitution. Cadres and soldiers of a certain coastal defense unit of the East China Military Region wrote to the leaders of the East China Military Region, expressing their determination: "In order to liberate Taiwan, we are determined to dedicate everything we have." The enthusiasm of cadres and soldiers in all units for military training has become even higher. The entire personnel of the electrician group of the repair company of a certain automobile regiment of the Northwest Military Region took the initiative to use waste materials and old materials in their spare time to repair generators, motors, and other items, saving the country more than 16 million yuan. Soldiers of a certain class of a certain battalion of a certain unit of the Central South Military Region, in discussing the draft constitution, combined it with a review of the military learning situation, launched mutual aid activities, and the entire class achieved excellent results in tactical tests and shooting.

【Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 10th】The propaganda and discussion activities of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army units have come to an end successively.

Since the promulgation of the draft constitution, the Volunteer Army units have launched widespread and enthusiastic propaganda and discussion activities. The leading organs of the Volunteer Army held a draft constitution propaganda week from June 30th to July 6th. Leading cadres and rapporteurs from the regimental level and above in all units also made two to four reports to the vast number of cadres and soldiers of all units and services from the end of June to the end of August. Cadres and soldiers of all units actively participated in the discussions. In the discussions, cadres and soldiers of all units put forward many opinions on revising and supplementing certain articles of the draft constitution.

After discussing the draft constitution, the broad masses of cadres and soldiers of the Volunteer Army greatly improved their socialist ideological awareness and strengthened their will to defend the motherland and defend peace.

We must resolutely support the struggle of the people and the People's Liberation Army to liberate Taiwan with practical actions to defend the victory of the Korean armistice and strive for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue.
