Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 31st: Korean Democratic People's Republic Foreign Minister Nam Il issued a statement on the 30th, protesting the Japanese government's illegal persecution of Korean residents in Japan.

The statement said: The Japanese government suppresses the freedom of Korean residents in Japan to fight for the freedom, unification, and independence of their motherland, and against the Syngman Rhee puppet clique and foreign aggressors. Moreover, it disregards their legitimate rights as citizens of the Korean Democratic People's Republic, forcibly imposing the so-called "Republic of Korea" nationality of the Syngman Rhee gang, and forcibly sending them to South Korea under the rule of the Syngman Rhee gang. In addition, their property is confiscated, they are denied employment, and they are deprived of their right to democratic national education. Recently, these persecution activities have intensified.

The statement emphasized: The government of the Korean Democratic People's Republic believes that the above-mentioned illegal persecution of Korean residents in Japan by the Japanese government blatantly violates the universally recognized principles and practices of modern international law regarding the legal status of aliens.

Protecting the legitimate rights of Korean residents abroad is the firm and unwavering policy of the government of the Korean Democratic People's Republic. The government of the Korean Democratic People's Republic demands that the Japanese government recognize the legitimate rights of Korean residents in Japan as citizens of the Korean Democratic People's Republic, guarantee their freedom to fight for the freedom, unification, and independence of their motherland, and against the Syngman Rhee puppet clique and foreign aggressors, immediately release the Korean residents who have been forcibly detained, stop forcibly sending them to South Korea under the rule of the Syngman Rhee gang, guarantee the freedom of residence and employment, the safety of life and property, and all legitimate rights such as democratic national education for Korean residents in Japan, and return all illegally confiscated property. At the same time, it demands that measures be taken to ensure that such incidents do not occur again in the future.

    抗议日本政府无理迫害在日本的朝鲜侨民
    【新华社平壤三十一日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日在三十日发表声明，抗议日本政府对居住在日本的朝鲜侨民的非法迫害。
    声明说：日本政府压制居住在日本的朝鲜侨民为争取自己祖国的自由、统一、独立以及反对李承晚傀儡集团和外来侵略者而进行斗争的自由，而且无视他们作为朝鲜民主主义人民共和国公民的正当权利，强迫他们加入李承晚匪帮的所谓“韩国”国籍，用暴力把他们送到李承晚匪帮统治下的南朝鲜。此外，还没收他们的财产，不给他们职业，剥夺他们的民主的民族教育的权利等。最近一个时期，这些迫害活动更是变本加厉。
    声明强调说：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府认为：日本政府对居住在日本的朝鲜侨民的上述非法迫害，横暴地违反了现代国际法所公认的关于外侨的法律地位和惯例。
    保护在外国的朝鲜侨民的正当权利，是朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的坚定不移的政策。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府要求日本政府承认居住在日本的朝鲜侨民的作为朝鲜民主主义人民共和国公民的正当权利，保障他们为争取自己祖国的自由、统一和独立及反对李承晚傀儡集团和外来侵略者而进行斗争的自由，立即释放已被强迫拘留的朝鲜侨民，停止用暴力把他们送到李承晚匪帮统治下的南朝鲜，保障居住在日本的朝鲜侨民的居住和就业的自由、生命财产的安全和民主的民族教育等一切正当的权利，归还非法没收的一切财产。同时，要求采取措施，保证此类事件今后不再发生。
