Hengshan County, Hunan Province, Launches Mass Overproduction Movement

In Hengshan County, Hunan Province, the call for "overproduction" has transformed into a massive patriotic production movement, igniting a mass upsurge in rushing to harvest and plant. As of September 1st, four districts and the town of Chengguan out of the county's fifteen districts and two towns had completed 2% to 20% of their "overproduction" targets. More than 95% of the early and mid-season rice paddies harvested throughout the county were promptly planted with autumn crops, realizing the slogan "Harvest one field, plant one field." From a county-wide perspective, double-cropping rice and sweet potatoes, the two main autumn crops, have basically completed and exceeded the expansion planting plan. The county has planted more than 299,000 mu of various autumn crops, including double-cropping rice, ratooning rice, and sweet potatoes. Hengshan County has a later season, and late-maturing mid-season rice is now being harvested in large quantities. The autumn planting area in various places is expanding daily. It is expected that the autumn planting plan for this year will be fully completed and exceeded by September 10th.

In the overproduction movement, cadres and masses in Hengshan County demonstrated a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm and patriotic production zeal. After holding mobilization meetings, many district and township cadres traveled dozens of miles back to their districts and townships at night, and immediately launched intensive work to organize and mobilize the masses. The county and district committees personally went deep into townships and mutual aid teams to specifically help farmers find ways to increase production, and with each step of the work, promptly conducted in-depth inspections, discovered problems, and promptly summarized advanced experiences and promoted them throughout the county and district.

Mutual aid and cooperative organizations in various places have also largely paid attention to helping surrounding individual farmers and households lacking labor to solve production difficulties. In Shimen Township, Fifth District, sixty-eight households in difficulty had more than 220 mu of fields. They could not find anyone to harvest the ripe rice, let alone have the labor to engage in overproduction. The mutual aid organizations in this township solved the difficulty of not being able to hire labor by contracting work, helping with work, and absorbing them into mutual aid teams. They achieved careful harvesting and threshing, and also promptly planted autumn crops. It is estimated that they can increase production by more than 6,500 jin. This has brought their production potential into play and boosted their confidence in increasing production, and a widespread upsurge in autumn harvesting and planting has been set off throughout the township.

This autumn, farmers have a common response: "In the past, the Grain Full stage meant the fields were full of yellow, but the White Dew stage swept it all away; this year, one piece of yellow is cut, and another piece is green."

    湖南省衡山县开展群众性超额增产运动
    “超额增产”的号召在湖南省衡山县已变成为声势浩大的爱国增产运动，掀起了群众性抢收抢种高潮。至九月一日，全县的十五个区、两个镇中，已有四个区和城关镇，完成“超额增产”指标的百分之二至二十。全县已收割的早、中稻田里，百分之九十五以上及时种上了秋季作物。实现了“收一丘，种一丘”的口号。从全县范围来看，双季稻、红薯两种主要秋季作物，已基本完成和超额完成扩大种植计划，全县已种植双季稻、再生稻、红薯等各项秋季作物二十九万九千多亩，衡山县季节较晚，现晚熟中稻正大量收割，各地秋种面积正在逐日扩大，预计九月十日，即可全面完成和超额完成今年秋种计划。在超额增产运动中，衡山县的干部和群众表现了高度的革命积极性和爱国生产热情。许多区乡干部开过动员会后，黑夜数十里赶回本区本乡，随即展开紧张的组织和发动群众的工作。县委、区委亲自深入到乡、互助组，具体帮助农民找生产门路，并随着每一个工作步骤，及时深入检查，发现问题，及时总结先进经验，推广到全县全区。各地互助合作组织还大都注意到帮助周围单干农民和缺劳力户解决生产中的困难。五区石门乡六十八户困难户，有田二百二十多亩，黄熟的稻谷请不到人收割，更无劳力搞增产。这个乡的互助组织用包工、帮工、吸收他们参加互助组等办法，解决了他们请不到工的困难，做到了细收细打，还及时种上了秋季作物，预计可增产六千五百多斤。这就发挥了他们的生产潜力，鼓舞了他们增产的信心，全乡普遍地掀起秋收秋种高潮。今秋，农民们有个普遍的反应：“过去是处暑满垄黄，白露一扫光；今年是，割了一片黄，又是一片青”。
