Achievements in China's Socialist Industrialization Construction

Over the past five years since the founding of New China, the Chinese people have made brilliant achievements in the great struggle to realize socialist industrialization.

Before liberation, China's industry was very backward, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang severely damaged our country's weak industry during their defeat. In the short three years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese working class, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, with the support of the people of the whole country and the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, carried out tremendous restoration and reconstruction work, launched labor competitions, and enabled industrial production to reach and exceed pre-war levels, creating favorable conditions for large-scale economic construction.

In 1953, China entered a new period of planned construction, carrying out new construction work on the basis of economic recovery. The famous Anshan Iron and Steel Company is being built into a giant iron and steel complex. New steel bases are being planned. In the fuel industry, a number of large-scale power stations, coal mines, and oil wells have been built or are under construction. The foundation of China's machinery industry is being strengthened day by day, and many large machinery factories manufacturing smelting, power generation, and mining equipment are under construction. While developing heavy industry, China's light industry has also been correspondingly developed and is gradually meeting the material and cultural needs of the people.

On the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the entire Chinese people are marching towards the great goal of socialist industrialization with full confidence.

    The above picture shows a corner of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, China's largest ferrous metallurgical center.

    National coal production in 1953 has broken through the highest production level in history, and this year the total national coal production will have a further increase compared with last year. This is China's largest newly built open-pit coal mine - Fuxin Haizhou Open-pit Mine. Xinhua News Agency reporter Jia Chengbin

    China's machinery industry has greatly developed in the past five years. It is now able to manufacture various general machinery and equipment and some precision and large-scale equipment. This is a worker from Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory meticulously machining the "rotor" of China's first 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator.

    The construction projects of many new and large-scale factories in China are progressing rapidly. The completion and commissioning of these factories will directly accelerate the speed of China's socialist industrialization.

    In order to supply the ever-developing industrial construction with sufficient power, China's electric power industry has achieved rapid development. This is an electrical operator from Fengman Hydropower Station inspecting newly installed large-capacity transformers.

    The petroleum industry has also recovered and developed. This is China's largest natural oil mine - Yumen Oil Mine. After expansion, crude oil production has greatly increased. The refined gasoline, diesel, kerosene and other finished products are being supplied to transportation, industry and people's lives. Xinhua News Agency reporter Yao Zongyi

    Cultural and professional paper, which China has mainly relied on imports for decades, can now be largely self-sufficient; industrial paper, which has always relied on imports, can now be self-made to some extent and will gradually achieve self-sufficiency. This is a workshop of the newly built state-owned Anhui Paper Mill. Jiefang Daily Manuscript

    The textile industry, which is closely related to the lives of the broad masses of people, has greatly developed in the past few years. New cotton textile factories are constantly being built in various cotton-producing areas. This is a workshop of the state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory that has been completed.

    我国社会主义工业化的建设成就
    新中国成立五年来，中国人民在为实现社会主义工业化的伟大斗争中，取得了辉煌成就。
    解放前的中国工业是很落后的，而蒋匪帮在溃败时又对我国的一点微弱工业进行了严重破坏。在中华人民共和国成立后短短的三年多中间，中国工人阶级在中国共产党的领导下、在全国人民的支援和苏联的无私帮助下，进行了巨大的恢复和重建工作，开展了劳动竞赛，使工业生产达到和超过了战前水平，给大规模经济建设创造了有利条件。
    一九五三年，我国进入了有计划建设的新时期，在经济恢复的基础上进行新的建设工作。著名的鞍山钢铁公司正在建设为巨型的钢铁联合企业。新的钢铁基地正在筹建。在燃料工业方面，若干规模巨大的发电站、煤炭矿井和石油井已经建成或正在进行建设。我国机械工业的基础在日益加强，制造冶炼、发电、采矿等设备的许多大型机械工厂正在建设。与发展重工业的同时，我国轻工业也得到相应发展，并在逐步满足着人民的物质和文化生活的需要。
    在建国五周年的时候，全中国人民正信心百倍地朝着社会主义工业化的伟大目标迈进。
    上图是我国目前最大的黑色冶金中心——鞍山钢铁公司的一角。
    全国煤产量在一九五三年已突破了历史上最高的生产水平，今年全国煤的总产量又将比去年有进一步的增长，这是我国新建的最大的露天煤矿——阜新海州露天矿。　新华社记者　贾承滨摄
    我国的机械工业，五年来有了很大的发展。现在已能自制各种一般的机器设备和部分精密的、大型的设备。这是上海电机厂工人在精车我国试制的第一部六千瓩汽轮发电机的“转子”。上海电机厂　左家忠摄
    我国许多新型的、规模巨大的工厂的建厂工程正在迅速进展。这些工厂的建成和投入生产，将直接加快我国社会主义工业化的速度。这是正在建造的我国第一汽车制造厂的热电站厂房外景。　新华社稿

    为供应日益发展的工业建设以充足的动力，我国电力工业获得了迅速的发展。这是丰满水电站的电气运转员巡视新安装的大容量变压器。

    石油工业也恢复和发展了。这是我国现在最大的天然石油矿——玉门油矿，经过扩建以后，原油产量已经大大增加。经过炼制成的汽油、柴油、煤油等成品，正源源供应交通、工业和人民生活的需要。新华社记者　姚宗仪摄
    我国几十年来主要依靠进口的文化专业用纸，现在相当大的一部分已能自给；一向依靠输入的工业用纸，现在已能自制一部分，并将逐步做到自给。这是新建的国营安徽造纸厂的一个车间。　解放日报稿
    与广大人民生活有密切关系的纺织工业，几年来有了很大的发展。新的棉纺织厂不断在各个产棉区兴建起来。这是已经建成的国营北京第一棉纺织厂的一个车间。北京日报稿（附图表）
