    National Women Unite and Fight for the Liberation of Taiwan
    Li Dequan, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation
    The joint declaration of the democratic parties and people's organizations of our country for the liberation of Taiwan expresses the common will and firm determination of the 600 million people of our country to liberate Taiwan, complete the reunification of the motherland, ensure the security of the motherland, and defend world peace. Chinese women, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely support this great and just declaration and vow to fight for the realization of the sacred task of liberating Taiwan.
    Since being driven out of the mainland by the Chinese people, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has been clinging to Taiwan under the protection of the US government. This traitorous clique has sold out Taiwan, turning it into a US colony and military base. This traitorous clique constantly harasses the coastal areas and islands of the motherland, massacres the people, loots fishing boats, robs merchant ships of various countries trading with our country, and sends special agents to infiltrate our mainland to carry out sabotage activities. This traitorous clique has recently conspired to establish a military alliance with the United States, actively serving as a tool for the United States to create tension in the Far East, attempting to attack the mainland of the motherland, provoke a world war, and conspire to restore its rule in China. This series of shameless and traitorous crimes committed by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has aroused the infinite anger of the people and women of the whole country.
    Our women compatriots will never forget that the Chiang Kai-shek traitor is the public enemy of the Chinese people and the public enemy of Chinese women. Under Chiang’s bloody reactionary rule, countless women were persecuted and humiliated, countless children were devastated and died young, and countless families suffered poverty and destruction. After the liberation of the mainland, women have gained a free and happy life. However, the women compatriots in Taiwan are still groaning under Chiang’s bloody tyranny. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique colludes with the American aggressors to cruelly exploit the people of Taiwan, making the people, women, and children of Taiwan live a very miserable life. According to Taiwan newspapers, many Taiwan women are forced into prostitution due to difficult living conditions; in Taipei alone, there are more than 10,000 prostitutes, an average of one prostitute for every ten adult women. Many families, unable to make a living, painfully sell their own daughters to others as "adopted daughters," and these "adopted daughters" are mostly bullied and abused, and eventually forced into prostitution. In addition, Taiwan women are also ravaged and raped by Chiang’s bureaucrats and bandits, and female students and young women are forced to receive military training and "serve" in military camps. Everyone, think about it, what a terrifying hell on earth this is! Taiwan women are our dear compatriots, we must not allow the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to continue to ravage them, we must settle the towering crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek traitor!
    Taiwan is Chinese territory. The Chinese people’s liberation of Taiwan is to punish the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in order to achieve the complete reunification of the country and complete the sacred liberation cause of the Chinese people. Therefore, the liberation of Taiwan is China’s sovereignty and internal affairs, and no foreign interference is allowed. American imperialism continues to occupy Taiwan and shelter the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, using Taiwan as a base for aggression against our country and for provoking a new war in the Far East, which not only violates our country’s territorial sovereignty, but also increases the threat of war in the Far East and endangers the peaceful interests of all countries in Asia. In order to further ease international tensions and to maintain and consolidate peace in Asia, we must liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. Therefore, the Chinese people’s struggle to liberate Taiwan is a struggle to defend world peace. This just struggle will surely receive the sympathy and support of peace-loving people all over the world. We firmly believe that the Chinese people’s struggle to liberate Taiwan will surely be victorious, and the American imperialists' policy of aggression and interference will surely fail.
    Women across the country, the liberation of Taiwan is a just, glorious, and great cause, and it is also a serious and arduous struggle. We must unite more closely and use practical actions to support the sacred struggle to liberate Taiwan!
    In order to liberate Taiwan, female workers and rural women across the country must further develop the movement to increase production and practice economy, and strive to complete and over fulfill the national construction plan. Women in disaster areas should actively participate in the production and self-rescue movement centered on mutual assistance and cooperation.
    In order to liberate Taiwan, women across the country must assist the government in doing a good job in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers, and support the People's Liberation Army in its victorious advance!
    In order to liberate Taiwan, women across the country must strengthen unity, heighten vigilance, prevent special agent activities, and assist the government in doing a good job in public security and defense!
    Taiwan women, we deeply sympathize with your tragic situation, and hope that you will carry forward the spirit of patriotism, accumulate strength, and work with the people of Taiwan to prepare to welcome the People's Liberation Army!
    To the families of those who fled to Taiwan with Chiang, the policy of the Central People's Government is lenient. You should advise your relatives to abandon the darkness and turn to the light, and perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes.
    Women across the country, unite more strongly, and together with the people of the whole country, strive to complete the sacred task of liberating Taiwan!

    全国妇女团结起来，为解放台湾而斗争
    中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席　李德全
    我国各民主党派各人民团体为解放台湾的联合宣言，表达了我国六万万人民为解放台湾、完成祖国统一、保障祖国安全、保卫世界和平的共同意志和坚定决心。中国妇女和全国人民一道，坚决拥护和支持这个伟大的、正义的宣言，誓为实现解放台湾的神圣任务而奋斗。
    蒋介石卖国集团自从被中国人民赶出大陆以后，在美国政府庇护之下，盘据台湾苟延残喘。这个卖国集团出卖了台湾，把台湾变为美国的殖民地和军事基地。这个卖国集团不断地骚扰祖国沿海地区和岛屿，屠杀人民，劫夺渔船，打劫各国与我国通商的商船，派遣特务潜入我国大陆进行破坏活动。这个卖国集团最近更阴谋与美国建立军事同盟，积极充当美国制造远东紧张局势的工具，妄图进攻祖国大陆，挑拨世界战争，阴谋在中国复辟。蒋介石卖国集团这一系列的无耻卖国罪行，已经激起了全国人民和妇女的无比愤怒。
    我们妇女同胞们永远不会忘记，蒋介石卖国贼是中国人民的公敌，是中国妇女的公敌。在蒋贼血腥的反动统治下，无数妇女遭到迫害和侮辱，无数儿童遭到摧残和夭折，无数家庭遭受穷困和破坏。祖国大陆解放后，妇女们都获得了自由幸福的生活。但是，台湾的妇女同胞们却仍然呻吟于蒋贼的血腥暴政之下。蒋介石卖国集团勾结美国侵略者残酷地压榨台湾人民，使台湾人民和妇女儿童过着十分悲惨的生活。据台湾的报纸透露，许多台湾妇女因生活困难，被迫为娼；仅台北市一地就有娼妓一万多人，平均每十名成年妇女中就有一个娼妓。许多家庭由于无法生活，忍痛地把亲生女儿出卖给人做“养女”，而这些“养女”大部分受到欺凌和虐待，最后也被迫为娼。除此之外，台湾妇女还遭到蒋贼官僚和匪军的蹂躏和奸污，女学生和女青年被强迫受军训和到军营“服务”。大家想想，这是多么恐怖的人间地狱啊！台湾妇女是我们亲爱的同胞姊妹，我们决不能容许蒋介石卖国集团继续蹂躏她们，我们一定要清算蒋介石卖国贼的滔天罪行！
    台湾是中国的领土。中国人民解放台湾，是为了讨伐蒋介石卖国集团，以实现国家的完全统一，完成中国人民神圣的解放事业。因此，解放台湾是中国的主权和内政，决不容许外国干涉。美帝国主义继续侵占台湾、庇护蒋介石卖国集团，把台湾作为侵略我国和在远东挑拨新战争的基地，不仅是侵犯了我国的领土主权，而且是增加远东战争威胁，危害了各国在亚洲的和平利益。为了进一步缓和国际紧张局势，为了维护和巩固亚洲的和平，我们必须解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团。因此，中国人民解放台湾的斗争就是保卫世界和平的斗争。这一正义的斗争必将得到全世界爱好和平人民的同情和支持。我们深信，中国人民解放台湾的斗争是一定会胜利的，而美帝国主义的侵略和干涉政策是一定要失败的。
    全国妇女们，解放台湾是一件正义的、光荣的和伟大的事业，同时也是一项严重的和艰巨的斗争。我们必须更加紧密地团结起来，用实际行动来支援解放台湾的神圣斗争！
    为了解放台湾，全国职工妇女们和农村妇女们要进一步开展增产节约运动，争取完成和超额完成国家建设计划。灾区妇女们要积极参加以互助合作为中心的生产自救运动。
    为了解放台湾，全国妇女要协助政府做好拥军优属工作，支援人民解放军胜利进军！
    为了解放台湾，全国妇女要加强团结，提高警惕，防止特务活动，协助政府做好治安保卫工作！
    台湾妇女们，我们深切同情你们的悲惨处境，希望你们发扬爱国主义精神，积蓄力量，和台湾人民一道，准备迎接人民解放军！
    跟随蒋贼逃往台湾的人员的家属们，中央人民政府的政策是宽大的，你们要劝告自己的亲人，使他们弃暗投明，立功赎罪。
    全国妇女们，更加坚强地团结起来，和全国人民一起，为完成解放台湾的神圣任务而奋斗！
