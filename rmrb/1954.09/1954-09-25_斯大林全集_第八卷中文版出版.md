The Chinese edition of "The Complete Works of Stalin," Volume VIII, has been published and is now being distributed in Xinhua bookstores in major cities across the country.

"The Complete Works of Stalin," Volume VIII, includes Stalin's works from January to November 1926.

1926 was the first year that the Bolshevik Party launched a struggle to realize the general policy of national socialist industrialization of the Party and the Soviet government. The characteristic of this period was the increasing complexity of the struggle between capitalist countries and the Soviet Union, as well as between socialist and capitalist elements within the Soviet Union. Imperialism, fearing the consolidation and development of the Soviet Union, tried every means to obstruct the construction work of the Soviet Union. Within the Soviet Union, the Trotskyist and Zinoviev elements, agents of capitalism, formed an anti-Party alliance, distorted Leninism, engaged in splitting activities, undermined the unity of the Party, and attempted to lead the Party and the state away from the Leninist path, thereby embarking on the road to the elimination of the achievements of the proletarian revolution and the restoration of capitalism.

The task facing the Party at that time was to ideologically and organizationally crush the Trotsky-Zinoviev anti-Party alliance, defend the Party and Leninism, unite the whole Party on the basis of the struggle for socialist construction, and realize the general policy of national socialist industrialization stipulated by the Fourteenth National Congress of the Party.

In his article "On Some Questions Concerning Leninism," Stalin exposed the hostile distortion of the foundations of Leninism by the Zinoviev-Kamenev group and defended the invincible Leninism. In this work, Stalin pointed out the international significance of Leninism, analyzed the difference between bourgeois revolution and proletarian revolution, and discussed the role and tasks of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the structure of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the role of the Party in the system of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the relationship between the Party and the Soviets, and the worker-peasant alliance as the foundation of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Based on the specific domestic and international conditions of the Soviet Union, Stalin elaborated and developed Lenin's theory that socialism could first achieve victory in individual countries. Stalin pointed out that the question of the possibility of the victory of socialism in one country should not be confused with the question of the final victory of socialism; the Soviet working class, in alliance with the peasantry, could build socialism, but to achieve the final victory of socialism, that is, to have a complete guarantee against armed intervention by foreign bourgeoisie, it was necessary to have the victory of the working class revolution in all countries of the world or at least in several major countries. Stalin's discussion on the possibility of building a socialist society in the Soviet Union strengthened the Soviet people's conviction in the inevitable victory of socialist construction. Stalin repeatedly demonstrated this issue in "On the Possibility of Building Socialism in Our Country," in the report "On the Social-Democratic Deviation in Our Party," and in the conclusion to this report.

In the outline "On the Opposition Bloc in the CPSU(B)" drafted by Stalin for the Fifteenth All-Union Congress of the Party, in his report "On the Social-Democratic Deviation in Our Party," and in the conclusion to this report, Stalin particularly emphasized the importance of Party solidarity and unity, observance of Party discipline, and obedience to and support of the Party's leadership in ensuring the realization of socialist industrialization. He exposed the capitulationist ideas and the factional activities of the Trotsky-Zinoviev alliance that undermined and split the Party, and pointed out that observing Party discipline and maintaining the prestige of the Party's leading organs are two extremely important aspects of strengthening Party solidarity and protecting Party unity. Stalin particularly emphasized that "the Party must protect the unity of its ranks like the apple of its eye," and "Party unity is the main antidote to all kinds of counter-revolutionary attempts by the enemies of the revolution."

In the report "On the Economic Situation of the Soviet Union and the Policy of the Party," Stalin, based on the principles put forward by Lenin, stipulated the policy and specific path of socialist industrialization, emphatically pointing out that "industrialization should first of all be understood as the development of our heavy industry, especially the nerve center of the entire industry, the development of our own machine manufacturing industry." Stalin also made incisive discussions on various issues that must be resolved in order to realize socialist industrialization, such as capital accumulation and rational use of accumulation, training of cadres for industrial construction, enhancing the enthusiasm of the working class, consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, further developing intra-Party democracy, and protecting Party unity.

In speeches such as "On the Struggle Against Rightist and 'Ultra-Leftist' Deviations," "Speech at the Meeting of the French Commission of the Sixth Enlarged Plenum of the Executive Committee of the Communist International," "Speech at the Meeting of the German Commission of the Sixth Enlarged Plenum of the Executive Committee of the Communist International," "On the British Strike and the Polish Events," "On the Anglo-Russian Unity Committee," and "On the Anglo-Russian Committee," Stalin pointed out to foreign fraternal parties that they must wage a persistent and unremitting struggle for the unity of the working class, against the reactionary forces of imperialism, and against the danger of a new imperialist war. Resolutely opposing opportunism and consolidating the Party ideologically and organizationally is a prerequisite for winning the struggle.

In his speech "On the Future of the Chinese Revolution," Stalin revealed the characteristics, nature, and development direction of the Chinese revolution, pointed out the responsibility of the proletariat and its party as the initiators and leaders of the Chinese revolution, and gave extremely important guidance to the Chinese revolution.

Documents published for the first time in Volume VIII include "The Peasants, Allies of the Working Class," "Letter to Slepkov," "On Methods of Alleviating Intra-Party Struggle," and "Letter to the Editorial Department of the 'Daily Worker,' the Central Organ of the Workers Party of America." In addition, this volume publishes the full text of Stalin's letter to Comrade Kaganovich and other members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine on resolving the national question in the country at that time.

    “斯大林全集”第八卷中文版出版
    “斯大林全集”第八卷中文本已经出版，现在开始在全国各大城市的新华书店发行。
    “斯大林全集”第八卷包括斯大林在一九二六年一月至十一月这个时期的著作。
    一九二六年是布尔什维克党为实现党和苏维埃政府的国家社会主义工业化总方针而展开斗争的第一年。这个时期的特点是，资本主义各国和苏联之间的斗争以及苏联内部社会主义成分和资本主义成分之间的斗争，都日益复杂化。帝国主义害怕苏联的巩固和发展，千方百计地阻碍苏联的建设工作。而在苏联国内，资本主义代理人托洛茨基和季诺维也夫分子结成了反党联盟，歪曲列宁主义，进行分裂活动，破坏党的统一，企图使党和国家离开列宁主义的道路，从而走上消灭无产阶级革命成果的道路，走上资本主义复辟的道路。
    当时摆在党面前的任务是从思想上和组织上粉碎托洛茨基—季诺维也夫反党联盟，保卫党和列宁主义，使全党在为社会主义建设而斗争的基础上团结起来，实现党的第十四次代表大会所规定的国家社会主义工业化的总方针。
    斯大林在“论列宁主义的几个问题”一文中，揭露了季诺维也夫—加米涅夫集团对列宁主义基础的敌意歪曲，捍卫了战无不胜的列宁主义。在这篇著作中，斯大林指出列宁主义的国际意义，分析了资产阶级革命与无产阶级革命之间的区别，论述了无产阶级专政的作用和任务、无产阶级专政的结构、党在无产阶级专政体系中的作用、党和苏维埃的相互关系以及作为无产阶级专政基础的工农联盟等问题。
    斯大林根据苏联国内国外的具体情况，详细地论证了和发展了列宁关于社会主义可能首先在个别国家内获得胜利的理论。斯大林指出，不能把社会主义可能在一个国家内胜利的问题和社会主义最后胜利的问题混为一谈；苏联工人阶级在同农民结成联盟的条件下是可以建成社会主义的，可是要取得社会主义的最后胜利，即有免除外国资产阶级武装干涉的完全保障，却必须要有世界各国工人阶级或至少几个主要国家工人阶级革命的胜利。斯大林关于在苏联能够建成社会主义社会的论述，加强了苏联人民对社会主义建设必胜的信念。在“关于我国建成社会主义的可能性”一文中，在“论我们党内的社会民主主义倾向”的报告以及关于这个报告的结论中，斯大林对这个问题作了反复的论证。
    斯大林在他为党的第十五次全国代表会议起草的“关于联共（布）党内的反对派联盟”的提纲中、在他的“论我们党内的社会民主主义倾向”的报告以及关于这个报告的结论中，特别强调党的团结与统一、遵守党纪、服从和拥护党的领导对于保证社会主义工业化的实现的重要性。他揭露了托洛茨基—季诺维也夫联盟的投降主义思想和破坏党、分裂党的派别活动，并指出遵守党的纪律和维护党的领导机关的威信是增强党的团结、保护党的统一的极重要的两个方面。斯大林特别强调“党必须像保护眼珠一样保护自己队伍的统一”，“党的统一是防止革命敌人各式各样反革命企图的主要抗毒素”。
    在“关于苏联经济状况和党的政策”这篇报告中，斯大林依据列宁提出的原理，规定了社会主义工业化的方针和具体道路，着重指出“工业化首先应当了解为发展我国的重工业，特别是发展我国自己的机器制造业这一整个工业的神经中枢”。对于实现社会主义工业化所必须解决的种种问题，如资金积累和合理使用积累、培养工业建设干部、提高工人阶级积极性、巩固工农联盟、进一步发扬党内民主和保护党的统一等，斯大林也在这篇报告中分别做了精辟的论述。
    在“关于反对右倾和‘极左’倾的斗争”、“在共产国际执行委员会第六次扩大全会法国委员会会议上的演说”、“在共产国际执行委员会第六次扩大全会德国委员会会议上的演说”、“关于英国罢工和波兰事件”、“关于英俄统一委员会”、“关于英俄委员会”等演说中，斯大林向外国兄弟党指出了必须为工人阶级的统一、为反对帝国主义反动势力、为反对新的帝国主义战争危险而进行顽强不懈的斗争。而坚决反对机会主义，从思想上和组织上来巩固党，是取得斗争胜利的先决条件。
    斯大林在“论中国革命的前途”的演说中，揭示了中国革命的特点、性质和发展方向，指出了无产阶级及其政党在中国革命中的倡导者和领导者的责任，给予中国革命以极端重要的指导。
    在第八卷中初次发表的文件有“关于工人阶级的同盟者农民”、“给斯列普柯夫的信”、“关于缓和党内斗争的办法”、“致美国工人党中央机关报‘工人日报’编辑部”的信等。此外，这一卷中发表了斯大林关于解决当时国内民族问题致卡冈诺维奇同志和乌克兰共产党（布）中央政治局其他委员的信的全文。
