Xinhua News Agency Report:

    Over the past five years, farmers in cotton-producing areas across the country have vigorously restored and developed cotton production to support the country's socialist industrialization and meet the needs of people's livelihoods.

    In the past five years, the cotton planting area nationwide has expanded significantly, the yield per unit area has increased remarkably, and the total output has increased substantially. If we take the national cotton planting area and yield per unit area in 1950 and the national total cotton output in 1949 as 100, the development progress is as follows: Planting area in 1951 was 150, in 1952 was 151, and in 1953 was 141; yield per unit area in 1951 was 98, in 1952 was 120, and in 1953 was 118; total output in 1950 was 160, in 1951 was 235, in 1952 was 291, and in 1953 was 265. It should be emphasized that the total national cotton output has exceeded the highest production level before the War of Resistance Against Japan (1936) every year since 1951. If we take the total national cotton output in 1936 as 100, then it was 123 in 1951, 152 in 1952, and 139 in 1953. In 1954, some cotton fields suffered from drought, floods, pests, and other disasters, but as long as we further strengthen late-stage field management, the total output is expected to be higher than in 1953.

    In order to rapidly restore and develop cotton production, over the past five years, the Communist Party organizations and People's Governments at all levels in cotton-producing areas have vigorously led farmers to organize, implemented a series of policies to reward cotton planting, and provided farmers with various forms of economic assistance. After completing land reform, various cotton-producing areas mobilized farmers to organize and take the road to common prosperity. After extensively publicizing the country's general task during the transition period last winter and this spring, the socialist consciousness of farmers in cotton-producing areas has greatly improved, and mutual aid and cooperation organizations have further developed. Among the policies to reward cotton planting, the main ones include reasonable price ratios between cotton and grain, reasonable burdens on cotton fields, payment of agricultural tax with cotton instead of grain, and signing contracts for advance purchase of cotton. From 1950 to 1953, cotton-producing areas across the country promoted and supplied more than 310 million jin of improved cotton seeds, more than 600,000 sprayers, as well as a large number of new-style walking plows, commercial fertilizers, and pest control agents; various localities also actively opened canals and drilled wells, and lent waterwheels, so that the irrigated area of cotton fields developed to more than 8 million mu. In addition, agricultural scientific research institutions and state-owned farms have gradually developed in various cotton-producing areas, and agricultural technology extension stations have been established to carry out experimental research and demonstration and promotion of cotton planting technology. These institutions use various methods to summarize and exchange farmers' cotton planting experience, and promote advanced Soviet cotton planting technology, which has also played a certain role in increasing cotton production.

    The major achievement of cotton production over the past five years lies in completely changing the situation of relying solely on imports of American cotton during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and basically achieving the goal of using cotton produced in our own country to meet the needs of the cotton textile industry and civilian cotton wadding. In the future, while vigorously increasing grain production, we must focus on generally increasing the yield per unit area, and reclaim large areas of wasteland suitable for cotton planting in coastal areas of Jiangsu, Shandong, Hebei and Xinjiang provinces, and gradually increase a certain amount of cotton fields year by year over the next few years, and vigorously increase cotton production.

### 全国棉花生产迅速恢复发展  基本上能供应工业和民用的需要

    全国棉花生产迅速恢复发展
    基本上能供应工业和民用的需要
    据新华社讯：全国产棉区农民五年来大力恢复和发展棉花生产，来支援国家社会主义工业化和供应人民生活需要。
    五年来，全国棉花种植面积扩大很多，单位面积产量显著提高，总产量大大增加。如果把一九五○年全国棉花的种植面积、单位面积产量和一九四九年全国棉花总产量都算做一○○，发展进度如下：种植面积一九五一年是一五○、一九五二年是一五一、一九五三年是一四一，单位面积产量一九五一年是九八、一九五二年是一二○、一九五三年是一一八，总产量一九五○年是一六○、一九五一年是二三五、一九五二年是二九一、一九五三年是二六五。这里需要着重指出的是：全国棉花总产量从一九五一年起连年都超过抗日战争以前（一九三六年）最高生产水平。如果把一九三六年全国棉花总产量算做一○○，那么一九五一年是一二三，一九五二年是一五二，一九五三年是一三九。一九五四年部分棉田遭到旱、涝、虫等灾害，但只要进一步加强后期田间管理，预计总产量仍高于一九五三年。
    为了迅速恢复和发展棉花生产，五年来产棉区各级共产党组织和人民政府大力领导农民组织起来，贯彻一系列奖励植棉的政策，并在经济上给农民以各种援助。产棉区各地先后在完成土地改革的基础上发动农民组织起来，走共同富裕的道路。去冬今春经过大张旗鼓地宣传国家在过渡时期的总任务后，产棉区农民的社会主义觉悟大大提高，互助合作组织有了进一步的发展。在奖励植棉的政策中，主要有棉粮合理比价，棉田合理负担和以棉花代替粮食缴纳农业税，订立预购棉花合同等。从一九五○年到一九五三年，产棉区各地共推广和供应优良棉种三亿一千多万斤，喷雾器六十多万架，以及大量新式步犁、商品肥料和治虫药剂；各地还积极开渠打井，贷放水车，使棉田灌溉面积发展到八百多万亩。另外，产棉区各地都逐步发展农业科学研究机构和国营农场，成立农业技术推广站，进行植棉技术的试验研究和示范推广工作。这些机构运用各种办法总结和交流农民的植棉经验，推广苏联先进的植棉技术，对棉花增产也起了一定的作用。
    五年来棉花生产的重大成就，在于完全改变了国民党反动统治时期一味依赖美国棉花进口的情况，基本上做到用我国自产的棉花来满足棉纺织工业和民用絮棉的需要。今后必须在大力增产粮食的同时，以普遍提高单位面积产量为重点，并在江苏、山东、河北等省沿海和新疆省等地开垦宜于植棉的大块荒地，在若干年内逐年增加一定数量的棉田，大力增产棉花。
