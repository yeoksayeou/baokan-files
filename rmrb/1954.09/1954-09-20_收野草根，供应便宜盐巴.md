    “Collecting Wild Grass Roots, Supplying Cheap Salt”
    This year, in the first half of the year, the National Trade Store in Leishan County, Guizhou Province, organized peddlers to cross the main peak of the Miaoling Mountains—Leigong Mountain—to supply production and living materials and purchase local and special products in five remote townships such as Maoping and Tiaojiang. After the peddlers arrived in the mountainous areas, local products such as Broussonetia papyrifera bark and Phellodendron amurense bark, which no one had purchased for many years, also found a market. The cadres of the National Trade Store also taught many people how to process local products. In May, they guided the masses in Qiaodui Township to produce and sell more than 300 kilograms of tea, in exchange for a batch of salt and iron farm tools. In the first half of the year, the National Trade Store purchased a total of 45 kinds of local products in these areas, such as Phellodendron amurense bark, Ophiopogon japonicus, honeysuckle, pig bristles, and musk, worth a total of 152.2 million yuan; supplied 5,800 pieces of iron farm tools, 48,000 kilograms of oil cake, and a batch of silk threads and satin items favored by ethnic minorities. The local Miao people gratefully said: Chairman Mao truly cares about the Miao people, sending cadres to collect wild grass roots (referring to medicinal materials) to supply us with cheap salt and farm tools.

    “收野草根，供应便宜盐巴”
    贵州省雷山县民族贸易商店今年上半年组织货郎担，翻过苗岭山脉的主峰——雷公山，到毛坪、挑江等五个边远乡供应生产和生活资料，收购土特产品。货郎担到山区以后，多年没有人收购的构皮麻、黄柏皮等土产品也有了销路。民族贸易商店的干部还教会许多群众加工土产品的方法。五月份，他们在桥兑乡就指导群众生产和出售了三百多斤茶叶，换回一批食盐和铁质农具。上半年，民族贸易商店在这些地区共收购黄柏皮、麦冬、金银花、猪鬃、麝香等土产四十五种，共值一亿五千二百多万元；供应铁质农具五千八百多件、油枯四万八千多斤，以及一批少数民族人民喜爱的花丝线、绸缎等物品。当地苗族人民感激地说：毛主席真关心苗家，派干部来收野草根（指药材），供给我们便宜的盐巴和农具。　　　　　　（张子武）
