Xinhua News Agency, September 6th: The People's Liberation Army's coastal artillery on the Fujian Front launched a fierce attack on the Chiang bandit troops entrenched on the Greater and Lesser Kinmen Islands, causing great panic to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and its American masters.

American news agencies admitted that our coastal artillery "very accurately hit every corner of Kinmen Island and other islands controlled by the Kuomintang in this area," and the Chiang bandit troops suffered "heavy" casualties. After suffering this heavy blow from us, the Chiang bandit Kai-shek repeatedly convened emergency meetings with his military leaders in a panic. Chase, the head of the U.S. military "aid" advisory group in Taiwan, and senior advisors stationed in the Chiang bandit army also participated in the meeting convened by the Chiang bandit Kai-shek on the 5th.

The heavy blow suffered by the Chiang bandit troops on Kinmen Island also made the American aggressor group, which is trying to obstruct the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan, extremely anxious. U.S. President Eisenhower held talks with senior officials of the Department of Defense on the 5th regarding this matter. It is reported that U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, who is in Manila participating in the meeting to discuss the establishment of the Southeast Asia military bloc, is also spending "a considerable amount of time and thought" studying news about Kinmen Island. Dulles also consulted with U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Stump on this issue.

Xinhua News Agency, September 6th: Our army shot down two Chiang bandit air force planes harassing Xiamen.

From 12:13 to 13:16 on the 5th, two Chiang bandit air force F-47 fighter planes sneaked into the airspace over Xiamen Port and Gulangyu Island for reconnaissance. One plane was shot down by our anti-aircraft artillery and fled.

At 5:15 on the 6th, a Chiang bandit air force P4Y naval bomber sneaked into the airspace near Shijuantou area on Xiamen Island and dropped nine bombs, most of which landed in the sea. Our anti-aircraft artillery immediately fired at the Chiang bandit plane, and the bandit plane was shot down and fled.

At 5:23 on the 6th, Chiang bandit troops on Kinmen Island and two Chiang bandit naval warships shelled Xiamen. Our coastal artillery immediately returned fire. The Chiang bandit naval warships fled into the distant sea after being shot at by us.

    【新华社六日讯】福建前线人民解放军海防炮兵对盘踞在大、小金门岛上的蒋贼军的猛烈打击，使蒋介石卖国集团和它的美国主子十分恐慌。
    美国通讯社承认，我海防炮兵“非常精确地打中金门岛和国民党在这个地区控制的其他岛屿的每一个角落”，蒋贼军伤亡“很重”。蒋匪介石在遭我这一次沉重打击后，一再慌张地召集他的军事头目举行紧急会议。美国驻台湾的军事“援助”顾问团团长蔡斯和顾问团派驻在蒋贼军中的高级顾问也在五日参加了蒋匪介石召集的会议。
    金门岛蒋匪军遭到沉重打击，也使力图阻挠中国人民解放台湾的美国侵略集团极为着急。美国总统艾森豪威尔在五日和国防部的高级官员为此举行了会谈。有消息说，正在马尼拉参加讨论成立东南亚军事集团的会议的美国国务卿杜勒斯，也在用“相当多的时间和心思”来研究有关金门岛的消息。杜勒斯并曾和美国太平洋舰队司令斯图普就这个问题进行商谈。
    【新华社六日讯】我军击伤骚扰我厦门的蒋贼空军飞机二架。
    五日十二时十三分到十三时十六分，蒋贼空军F—四十七型战斗机二架，窜入我厦门港和鼓浪屿上空盘旋侦察，遭我高射炮击伤一架后逸去。
    六日五时十五分，蒋贼空军P四Y型海军轰炸机一架窜入我厦门岛石狷头附近地区上空，投弹九枚，大部落于海中。我高射炮当即向这架蒋贼飞机射击，贼机被击伤后逃去。
    六日五时二十三分，金门岛上蒋贼军以及蒋贼海军军舰二艘向我厦门炮击。我海防炮兵立刻开炮还击，蒋贼海军军舰遭我射击后逃向远海。
