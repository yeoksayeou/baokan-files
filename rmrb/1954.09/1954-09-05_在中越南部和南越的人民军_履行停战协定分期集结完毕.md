    Xinhua News Agency, South Vietnam, September 3rd: The Vietnam People's Army in central and southern Vietnam completed their assembly on August 26th and August 31st respectively. The Vietnam People's Army faithfully implemented the Armistice Agreement and overcame all difficulties to transmit the General Headquarters' orders to various combat units distributed across a front line of nearly one thousand kilometers.
    During the assembly, despite the sabotage by the Ngo Dinh Diem group, the Vietnam People's Army received the full support of the residents. This work was able to be realized rapidly due to this support. This once again proves the infinite trust of the military and civilians of South Vietnam in President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnam Workers' Party, and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    在中越南部和南越的人民军
    履行停战协定分期集结完毕
    【新华社三日讯】越南通讯社南越三日讯：中越南部和南越的越南人民军已分别在八月二十六日和八月三十一日集结完毕。越南人民军忠实地履行了停战协定，并克服了一切困难把总司令部的命令传达到分布在将近一千公里长的战线上的各个战斗单位。
    在集结期间，尽管有吴庭艳集团的破坏，越南人民军得到了居民的完全支持。由于这种支持，这一工作得以迅速实现。这再一次证明了南越军民对胡志明主席、越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府的无限信任。
