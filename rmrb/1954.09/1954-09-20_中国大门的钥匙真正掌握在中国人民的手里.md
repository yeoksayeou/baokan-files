    The People's Republic of China is a nation that was subjected to imperialist aggression and oppression, and the old Chinese customs was an instrument of imperialist aggression against our country. Imperialists used it to dump commodities in large quantities, plunder our raw materials, and destroy our national industry and rural economy. In the later period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Kuomintang reactionaries further relied on American imperialism. For example, in the customs work, from 1943, the American imperialist agent Li Du served as the pseudo-Inspector General of Customs. In November 1946, the bandit Chiang Kai-shek signed the traitorous "Sino-American Treaty of Commerce" with the United States, allowing American merchant ships to navigate in any port in our country and load and unload goods at will. In 1947, the bandit Chiang Kai-shek signed the "Tariff Reduction Agreement" with the United States, reducing the import tax by one-half to five-sixths for more than 100 of the most important American goods. In addition, a large amount of open smuggling under the name of relief and sale of surplus materials monopolized the Chinese market. In just a few years, the already extremely fragile national industry and commerce were destroyed and unable to maintain. In Shanghai alone, from 1946 to the beginning of 1949, 50% to 90% of general industries were forced to close down.

    National liberation fundamentally changed the nature of the old Chinese customs, which concentratedly reflected the bureaucratic comprador system of imperialist rule in the colonies. For five years, the national customs has followed the policies of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government and carried out a series of reforms and constructions. In the reconstruction, the institutions were first adjusted, and the situation of numerous customs posts in the old China, which facilitated imperialist dumping, was changed. According to the principles of independence and self-reliance and the needs of the development of the people's economy in our country, some unnecessary inland customs and many branches were abolished. The Customs Law and the new tariff were implemented, laying the foundation for the people's customs system and realizing an independent tariff policy to protect trade. The new China's people's customs implements the state's foreign trade control and trade protection policy by actually supervising the import and export of goods, collecting tariffs and cracking down on smuggling. It has become an important part of the state organs that implement the foreign trade policy of our country.

    Thanks to the correct foreign trade policy of our country and the active role of the people's customs in protecting foreign trade, our country has achieved great achievements in foreign trade. The dependence of the old China's foreign trade on imperialism has been completely eliminated. On the basis of equality, mutual benefit and mutual assistance and cooperation, our trade with the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries has been expanded first. Although trade with capitalist countries has been hindered by the "blockade" and "embargo" of American imperialism, it has gradually developed under the great victory of the struggle of the entire peaceful and democratic forces. In 1953, the total import and export trade volume of the country increased by 36% compared with 1952. The import and export commodity structure is also very different. Everyone has seen that most of the goods imported from the customs are important materials for socialist economic construction, construction equipment and people's daily necessities, not things like cigarettes, foreign wines, glass stockings, and lipsticks. It is impossible for imperialists to smuggle or dump commodities at will as in the past. Our Central People's Government has helped the restoration and development of industrial and agricultural production in our country through the management of foreign trade and various customs work. With the prosperity and strength of the entire peace camp and the victory of our country's peaceful diplomatic policy, our country's exchanges with various countries in the world are becoming closer. More and more international friends, diplomatic personnel, peace activists, merchants, travelers, and crew members have come to our country; many overseas Chinese have returned to the motherland. When they enter our country, they first see that the current customs is completely different from the old Chinese customs. The key to China's door is truly in the hands of the Chinese people. The customs officers of the new China receive our friends and compatriots solemnly and politely, serve the people wholeheartedly, and at the same time vigilantly watch those American imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary elements who still attempt to destroy the people's China at all times.

    When American imperialism was driven out of the mainland by the Chinese people, it threatened us and said: "The Chinese people cannot run the customs well by themselves." The pseudo-Inspector General of Customs, the American Li Du, sent letters and telegrams from Hong Kong, Taiwan and other places, attracting customs personnel and trying his best to instigate sabotage. But the conspiracy of American imperialism has completely gone bankrupt. Facts have proved that only by driving away imperialism and overthrowing the reactionary regime can the Chinese people run their own customs well. Under the inspiration of great patriotism, the employees who used to work in the old customs, after participating in the people's customs work, gradually realized the true face of imperialism, understood that they are the masters of the new China today, and are completely different from doing things for imperialism in the old Chinese customs in the past, and realized the greatness and correctness of the Communist Party of China, and realized that their interests are consistent with the interests of the country, so their work enthusiasm has been continuously improved and their work efficiency has been greatly strengthened. In the old customs, their talents were buried, but now the new national system has created conditions for them to develop their talents. For the benefit of the people, the country pays attention to their training and education, improves their political and professional level, and reasonably uses them.

    I used to work in the old customs for 33 years, and I have long been in a relatively important position, but in the past, I lacked a correct understanding of the old customs as a tool for imperialism and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie to oppress and exploit the people. In the past few years, under the cordial help and leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and under the vivid education of the essential differences between the new and old customs, I have gradually realized the ugly face of imperialist rule over Chinese customs and learned the great truth of the people's revolution. Now, as a representative of the National People's Congress, I will definitely do my job better under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao in the future. I believe that customs workers across the country will certainly be able to continue to improve their political and professional level like me, guard the gate of the country with hundredfold vigilance, and strive to do a better job in customs work in order to support the development of domestic industry and agriculture and support the struggle to liberate Taiwan!

    中国大门的钥匙真正掌握在中国人民的手里
    全国人民代表大会代表  中央人民政府对外贸易部海关总署副署长  丁贵堂
    旧中国是受帝国主义的侵略压迫的国家，旧中国海关更是帝国主义侵略我国的工具。帝国主义利用它大量倾销商品，掠夺我国原料，摧残我国的民族工业和农村经济。抗日战争后期，国民党反动派进一步投靠了美国帝国主义，如在海关工作方面，从一九四三年起，以美帝国主义代理人李度为伪海关总税务司。一九四六年十一月蒋贼与美国签订了卖国的“中美商约”，允许美国商船可以在我国任何一个港口通航，任意起卸货物；一九四七年蒋贼又与美国签订了“关税减让协定”，对最主要的一百多项美货减低了进口税二分之一至六分之五；加上以救济及出售剩余物资名义大量公开走私，独占了我国市场，在短短几年中，本来已经极度脆弱的民族工商业就被摧残得无法维持。仅就上海一地，一九四六年至一九四九年初，一般工业被迫倒闭的即达百分之五十至九十。
    全国解放，集中反映了帝国主义统治殖民地的官僚买办制度的旧中国海关，从根本上改变了它的性质。五年以来，全国海关，遵循着中国共产党和中央人民政府的方针和政策，进行了一系列的改革和建设。在改建中首先调整了机构，改变了旧中国时代各地关卡林立，便利帝国主义倾销的情况；并根据独立自主的原则和我国人民经济发展的需要，撤销了某些内地不必要的海关和许多分支机构；实施了海关法和新税则，奠定了人民海关制度的基础，实现了保护贸易的独立自主的关税政策。新中国的人民海关以实际监督进出口货运，征收关税和查禁走私，来贯彻实行国家对外贸易管制与保护贸易的政策，它已成为我国实行对外贸易方针政策的国家机关的重要组成部分。
    由于我国对外贸易政策的正确和人民海关对保护对外贸易所发挥的积极作用，我国对外贸易获得了重大成就。旧中国对外贸易对帝国主义的依附性已完全肃清了，在平等互利和互助合作的基础上，首先扩大了我国与苏联及各人民民主国家的贸易；对资本主义国家贸易虽然受着美国帝国主义的“封锁”、“禁运”的阻碍，但在整个和平民主力量斗争的伟大胜利影响下，也逐步有了发展。一九五三年全国进出口贸易总额比较一九五二年增加了百分之三十六。进出口的商品结构也大大的不同了。大家都已看到，从海关进口的大部是社会主义经济建设的重要物资，是建设器材和人民生活必需品，而不是香烟、洋酒、玻璃丝袜、口红这些东西了。帝国主义梦想像过去一样任意走私或倾销商品是不可能了。我们中央人民政府通过对外贸易的管理和海关各项工作，扶助了我国工农业生产的恢复与发展。随着整个和平阵营的繁荣强大，我国和平外交政策的胜利，我国与世界各国的来往是更为密切了。日益增多的国际友人、外交人员、和平人士、商人、旅客、船员来到了我们的国家；不少华侨回到了祖国。当他们进入我国国境时，他们首先就看到：现在的海关和旧中国的海关是完全不同了，现在中国大门的钥匙是真正掌握在中国人民的手里了。新中国海关的关员严肃地有礼貌地接待我们的友人和侨胞，热忱地为人民服务，同时也警惕地注视着那些至今仍时刻企图破坏人民中国的美国帝国主义和蒋贼反革命分子。　美国帝国主义被中国人民赶出大陆时，曾威胁我们说：“中国人自己办不好海关”。伪总税务司美国人李度曾从香港、台湾等地纷纷发出函电，勾引海关人员，千方百计地进行挑拨破坏。可是美国帝国主义的阴谋是完全破产了。事实证明，只有赶走帝国主义，推翻了反动政权，中国人民才能办好自己的海关。在伟大的爱国主义鼓舞下，原来曾在旧海关工作过的员工，参加人民海关工作之后，逐步认清了帝国主义的真面目，明白了自己今天是新中国的主人，和过去在旧中国海关时替帝国主义做事完全不同，认识了中国共产党的伟大、正确，认识了自己的利益和国家利益是一致的，因而工作积极性不断提高，工作效率大大加强。在旧海关时，他们的才能被埋没了，现在新的国家制度为他们建立了发展才能的条件。为了人民的利益，国家注意对他们的培养教育，提高了他们的政治业务水平，合理地使用了他们。
    我过去在旧海关工作了三十三年之久，长期居于比较重要的地位，但过去我对旧海关是帝国主义及官僚资产阶级压迫剥削人民的工具缺乏正确的认识。几年来，在共产党和人民政府亲切的帮助和领导下，在新旧海关本质上不同的活生生的事实教育下，使我逐渐认识了帝国主义统治中国海关的丑恶面貌，知道人民革命的伟大真理。现在，作为全国人民代表大会的一个代表，我今后一定要更好地在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，做好自己的工作。我相信全国海关工作者，也一定能和我一样，继续不断地提高自己的政治业务水平，百倍警惕地看守国家大门，为扶助国内工农业的发展，支援解放台湾的斗争，进一步为做好海关工作而努力！
