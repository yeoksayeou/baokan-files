Your Names Are Forever Etched in the Hearts of the People
-- Welcoming the Returning Volunteers
Yang Shuo

Do you remember at the end of 1950, when our Volunteer Army was chasing the enemy on the Korean front, one dawn I was billeted with a group of soldiers in an empty, desolate shack on the road to Seoul. At that time, the Korean battlefield was covered in wind and snow; at that time, we couldn't even get enough fried flour to eat, and we couldn't get a warm sleep; at that time, the soldiers' cotton clothes were torn and their hair was long after continuous hard fighting. But in this wind-swept shack, guess what our soldiers were talking about?

At first, a soldier with round eyes and frostbite all over his cheeks mentioned the motherland, and another soldier asked him, "Do you miss it?" That soldier said, "No." Then someone laughed, "You say you don't miss it, but your soul flies back in your dreams." So the round-eyed soldier smiled and said, "Anyway, even if you force me to go back now, I won't go back. If I go back, what will I use to face the people of the motherland?"

It has been almost four years since that was said. Our soldiers have experienced so much hardship and created so many earth-shattering achievements, and finally returned to the motherland. Are you still worried about what to use to face the people of the motherland? You went victoriously and returned victoriously, and you brought the most precious gift in the world to the people of the motherland – that is honor, that is peace.

Four years is not a short time. In Korea, I saw such a general who suddenly found a gray hair on his temple and exclaimed in surprise, "Oh, I have a gray hair!" I have also seen such soldiers who have added scars to their bodies, making their young faces even more heroic. Each gray hair, each scar, is like the勋章纪念章 you wear on your chests, filled with infinite glory.

The motherland has been built behind you precisely because you used your chests to block the enemy. And in front of you, on that picturesque three-thousand-mile landscape, you, together with the Korean people, extinguished the flames of war ignited by the enemy and helped the Korean people rebuild their peaceful homes.

Now you are leaving that lovely land. I know that your mood is both excited and reluctant. You have lived, fought, and experienced pain and joy on that land. Every mountain, every river, every blade of grass, every tree, especially the deeply affectionate people there, has become a part of your life. How could you not be reluctant to leave suddenly?

But you have seen the motherland that you think about day and night, eating and sleeping. Over the past few years, you have braved wind and snow, rain and sun on the Korean battlefield, shed blood, and even more sweat. Some comrades have given their most precious lives for what? It is for the motherland! Not long ago, on the east coast of Korea, I met an eighteen or nineteen-year-old young signalman who always carried a few colored landscape photos of Beijing in his pocket. He was from the seaside and especially loved the sea in Korea. The topic he loved to talk about most was the motherland. He talked about it a thousand times over and over again, and he never got tired of it. I asked him, "What do you think is the most lovable thing about the motherland?" He said, "Everything is lovable." While desperately sniffing a salty sea breeze, he said, "Smell it, how good it smells! How is it like the smell of the motherland?"

Good children, now you don't have to just smell the scent, your feet are on the land of the motherland again. On the way back, how far is it from the Yalu River? I know you will all stick your heads out of the train, and you will definitely shout fiercely: "We're here! We're here! Isn't that the light we see?"

The motherland is no longer the motherland of a few years ago. Whether in the city or in the countryside, you will find new things and fresh things that you have never seen before. You will not be surprised at all, the motherland you imagined should be like this. But do you know that every piece of coal, every piece of steel, every screw, every grain produced by the motherland... contains your merits? Because it is you who have formed a fortress with your noble lives, defended the motherland, and enabled the people of the motherland to build such a good life.

Whenever you reach a time of fierce battle, you often shout with passionate generosity: "We must be responsible to the Korean people! Be responsible to the people of the motherland! Be responsible to the people of the world!" With this strong sense of responsibility, you have created honor and created today's cause of peace with your heroic spirit.

You are coming back to see the people of the motherland with these.

What will the people of the motherland use to welcome you?

The elderly mother may shed tears of joy, stroking your face and saying, "Children, you have been gone for a few years, and you are back!" Children wearing red scarves will hold handfuls of flowers and stuff them into your arms, shouting 친밀하게 and intimately. But the people of the entire motherland will dedicate the same thing to you. Everyone holds their own heart to welcome you. Every heart is engraved with your common name – Volunteer Army. History can be counted to a hundred years, a thousand years, but these words can never be erased from the hearts of the people.

You have returned victoriously. Tomorrow unfolds before us. May you create newer honors and newer careers in the distant future.

    你们的名字永远刻在人民的心上
    ——迎接志愿军返国部队
    杨朔
    还记得一九五零年年底，我们志愿军正在朝鲜前线追击敌人，有一天黎明，我在汉城路上一间空虚荒凉的小茅屋里宿营，和一班战士挤在一起。那时候朝鲜战场上漫天漫地，风雪飘扬；那时候我们炒面都吃不饱，觉更睡不暖；那时候战士们经过连续艰苦的战斗，棉衣都撕烂了，头发长的多长。可是就在这间风雪飘摇的小茅屋里，你猜我们战士谈论什么？
    起先，一个两眼滚圆，脸腮上满是冻疮的战士提起祖国，另一个战士问他道：“你想不想？”那战士说：“不想。”便有人笑起来：“还说不想呢，做着梦魂儿就飞回去了。”于是那圆眼的战士笑着说：“反正你现在就是逼着我回去，我也不回去。回去，我拿什么去见祖国人民呢？”
    这话提起来将近四年了。我们的战士经历过多少艰难困苦，创造了多少惊天动地的功绩，终于重新回到祖国来了。你们还愁拿什么来见祖国人民么？你们是胜利而去，胜利而归，你们带给祖国人民的是世界上顶顶珍贵的礼物——这就是荣誉，这就是和平。
    四年的日月不算短啊。在朝鲜时候，我见过这样的将军，忽然在鬓角上发现一根白发，惊奇地叫：“哎呀，有了白头发了！”我也曾见过这样的战士，身上添了伤疤，年青的脸变得更豪壮了。每根白发，每块伤疤，正像你们胸前挂的勋章纪念章
  一样，里面都藏着无限的光荣。
    祖国，正是由于你们用胸膛挡住了敌人，在你们背后建设起来了。而在你们前面，在那片图画一样好看的三千里江山上，你们跟朝鲜人民一起，扑灭了敌人点的战火，帮助朝鲜人民重新整顿起和平的家业。
    现在你们是离开那片可爱的土地了。我知道，你们的心情是又兴奋，又留恋。你们曾经在那片土地上生活过，战斗过，经历过痛苦和欢乐。那儿的
  一山一水，一草一木，特别是那儿感情深厚的人民，已经变成你们生命的一部分了。乍一离开，你们怎么会不留恋呢？
    可是你们又见到你们白天黑夜，吃饭睡觉，念念不忘的祖国了。几年来，你们在朝鲜战场上冲风冒雪，雨淋日晒，流过血，更流过汗，有的同志把自己最宝贵的生命都交出去了，为的是什么？就是为的祖国啊！不久前在朝鲜东海岸上，我认识了个十八、九岁的小通讯员，腰里总是揣着几张彩色的北京风景片。他是海边上人，特别爱朝鲜的海。他最爱跟人谈的话题就是祖国。翻来覆去谈一千遍，也不嫌絮烦。我问他：“你说祖国什么东西最可爱？”他说：“什么都可爱。”一边拚命用鼻子闻着一阵带点咸腥味的海风说：“你闻闻，多好闻啊！怎么就像祖国的气味一样？”
    好孩子，于今你不用光闻气味，你的脚又踏到祖国的土地上了。往回走时，离鸭绿江还有多远，我准知道你们都要从火车里探出头，不定叫的多凶呢：“到了！到了！那不是看见灯火了。”
    祖国早不是几年前的祖国了。无论在城市，无论在农村，你们到处都会发现从前没见过的新鲜事儿，新鲜东西。你们一点不会惊奇，你们想像中的祖国正应该是这样。可是你们知不知道，祖国出产的每块煤，每块钢，每根螺丝，每颗粮食……里面都含着你们的功绩？因为是你们，用高贵的生命结成一座堡垒，捍卫了祖国，使祖国人民建设成现在这种好生活。
    每逢到战斗激烈的关头，你们常常会激昂慷慨地喊：“我们要对朝鲜人民负责！对祖国人民负责！对全世界人民负责！”就怀着这种强烈的责任感，你们用英雄的气魄，创造了荣誉，创造了今天的和平事业。
    你们就是拿着这些回来见祖国人民的。
    祖国人民又拿什么来迎接你们呢？
    年老的母亲也许会流着欢喜的眼泪，抚着你们的脸说：“孩子，你们一去几年，可回来了！”打着红领巾的儿童们会捧着大把大把的鲜花，往你们怀里塞，嘴里亲亲密密喊着叔叔。但整个祖国的人民都要献给你们一样共同的东西。每人都捧着自己的心迎接你们。每颗心上都刻着你们共同的名字——志愿军。历史可以数到一百年，一千年，这几个字却永远不能从人民的心坎上磨灭掉的。
    你们是胜利地归来了。明天展开在我们面前。愿你们能在远大的将来里，创造出更新的荣誉，更新的事业。
