Xinhua News Agency, September 1st dispatch from Paris: The French people warmly welcome the news of the French National Assembly's rejection of the treaty on the establishment of the "European Defence Community." French public opinion believes that the Assembly's decision is the result of the efforts of patriots, peace fighters, public leaders, trade union leaders, and political leaders who opposed France joining the "European Defence Community."

The vast crowd gathered in front of the National Assembly cheered loudly when they heard the news that the Assembly had rejected the treaty. The decision quickly spread throughout the French capital, and rallies were immediately held in some areas.

From the rejection of the "European Army" treaty, the French people see a new opportunity to negotiate with relevant countries, peacefully resolve the German question, and establish an all-European collective security system.

Some public leaders and journalists issued a statement. The statement said: "Arming Germany in any form would obstruct Germany's unification and Europe's stability for years, and would drag France into an alliance in which it would suffer isolation (as in Brussels) and be ruled by foreign powers." The statement said: "This adventure, this self-degradation, is unreasonable, and it is not a wise diplomatic measure. The 'European Defence Community' should be replaced by negotiations on the German question and an all-European treaty. We ask the Parliament and the government to engage in this noble peace effort."

Xinhua News Agency, September 1st dispatch from Paris: French newspapers widely commented on the National Assembly's rejection of the Paris military treaty establishing the "European Defence Community."

"Le Figaro" wrote, "The National Assembly of the 30th buried the European Defence Community." The newspaper published a brief statement made by Mendès France in the Bourbon Palace lounge after the parliamentary vote on the 30th. Mendès France said, "The French government is unswervingly and unreservedly loyal to the Atlantic Alliance, and the Atlantic Alliance has been and will remain the guideline of the French government."

"Combat" expressed satisfaction with the rejection of the "European Army" treaty and wrote: "France says 'no' to the European Defence Community, and the difficulties shrouding political life disappear with it. The nightmare-like European Defence Community has died." The newspaper pointed out: "After the European Defence Community plan is rejected, the idea of ​​convening a four-power conference to study the issue of German unification will be put at the forefront."

"Les Échos" pointed out in an editorial: The rejection of the Paris Treaty means that "the issue that has been affecting French political life for almost four years has exited the stage."

"Le Parisien Libéré" believes that the vote on August 30 is a "very important decision" that will have "major consequences." The newspaper wrote: "Mendès France warned the National Assembly that the United States and Britain will soon demand the restoration of German sovereignty. This means that it will soon be proposed to the French Parliament to ratify the Bonn Treaty. Everything that links the Bonn Treaty to the Paris Treaty will be removed from the Bonn Treaty in advance."

"Libération" proposed that after the "European Defence Community" treaty is rejected, "the obstacles on the road to establishing lasting peace in Europe will also be eliminated. From now on, the government's task is to follow the path of easing international tensions and disarmament required by the people of all countries."

"L'Humanité" editorial emphasized that the rejection of the "European Army" treaty is "a great victory for the French people, a victory for the cause of peace." "L'Humanité" mentioned that the French Communist Party had fought against the idea of ​​the "European Army" from the very beginning, "French people with various opinions, often French people whose views differ greatly from those of the Communists, have united with the Communists in this great struggle for France and for peace." "L'Humanité" continued: "However, this does not mean that the danger of the revival of German militarism has been finally eliminated. The American imperialists have been stepping up pressure in order to use the European Defence Community to arm German revanchists, and the American imperialists will not give up their plans. The victory now achieved is a decisive stage in the struggle to smash the conspiracies of the American imperialists and their agents. Now that the European Defence Community Treaty has been rejected, it is still necessary to prevent the re-militarization of West Germany in any other form. All efforts must be made to guarantee European peace and to finally resolve the German question through democratic and peaceful means."

Newspapers reflecting the views of the pro-"European Army" faction reported the results of the parliamentary vote in an infuriated tone and tried to downplay its significance.

    法国人民热烈欢迎议会拒绝“欧洲军”条约
    “人道报”指出必须继续努力争取和平解决德国问题
    【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社巴黎八月三十一日讯：法国人民热烈欢迎法国国民议会拒绝关于建立“欧洲防务集团”条约的消息。法国舆论认为议会的决定是那些反对法国加入“欧洲防务集团”的爱国者、和平战士、公众领袖、工会领袖和政治领袖们努力的结果。
    聚集在国民议会前面的广大群众在听到议会已经拒绝了这个条约的消息时，大声欢呼。这一个决定迅速传遍了法国首都，有些地区立即举行了集会。
    法国人民从拒绝“欧洲军”条约这一件事看到了和有关国家进行协商、和平解决德国问题和建立全欧集体安全体系的新的机会。
    有一些公众领袖和记者发表了一篇声明。声明说：“不论用什么形式武装德国都会经年地阻挠德国的统一和欧洲的安定，并且会把法国拉入它在其中会遭受孤立（就像在布鲁塞尔一样）和受外国统治的联盟中去。”声明说：“这种冒险、这种自甘堕落是没有道理的，这不是英明的外交措施。应该用关于德国问题的和全欧条约的谈判来代替‘欧洲防务集团’。我们要求议会和政府从事这种崇高的和平努力。”
    【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社巴黎八月三十一日讯：法国报纸广泛评论国民议会拒绝建立“欧洲防务集团”的巴黎军事条约。
    “费加罗报”写道，“三十日的国民议会埋葬了欧洲防务集团。”这家报纸登载了孟戴斯—弗朗斯在三十日议会表决之后，在波旁宫休息室中所发表的简短声明。孟戴斯—弗朗斯说，“法国政府永不改变地、毫无保留地忠于大西洋联盟，大西洋联盟过去是、今后仍然是法国政府的准则。”
    “战斗报”对拒绝“欧洲军”条约表示满意，并且写道：“法国对欧洲防务集团说一声‘不’，笼罩政治生活上的困难就随之消失了。梦魇般的欧洲防务集团寿终正寝了。”这一家报纸指出：“欧洲防务集团计划遭到否决之后，召开四大国会议研究统一德国问题的念头就被推到首位上来了。”
      “回声报”在一篇社论中指出：否决巴黎条约意味着“差不多四年来一直对法国政治生活发生影响的问题退出了舞台。”
    “解放了的巴黎人报”认为八月三十日的表决是将会产生“重大后果”的“十分重要的决定”。这一家报纸写道：“孟戴斯—弗朗斯警告国民议会说：美国和英国将在最近要求恢复德国的主权。这就是说，很快就要建议法国议会批准波恩条约。凡是一切使波恩条约和巴黎条约有联系的东西都将预先从波恩条约中删除。”
      “解放报”提出，“欧洲防务集团”条约被拒绝后，“确立欧洲持久和平的道路上的障碍也就随着消除了。从今以后，政府的任务就是遵循着各国人民所要求的缓和国际紧张局势和裁军的途径去做。”
      “人道报”社论着重指出，拒绝“欧洲军”条约是“法国人民的大胜利、和平事业的胜利。”“人道报”提到，法国共产党从一开始就进行了反对“欧洲军”思想的斗争，“具有各种见解的法国人，往往有和共产党人的观点相差很远的法国人，都和共产党人联合在一起进行这一个为了法国、为了和平的伟大斗争。”“人道报”接着写道：“可是，现在并不等于说最后铲除了德国军国主义复活的危险。美国帝国主义者一直在加紧使用压力，以便利用欧洲防务集团来武装德国复仇主义分子，美国帝国主义者是不会放弃自己的计划的。现在取得的胜利是为粉碎美国帝国主义者和他们的代理人的阴谋的斗争中的一个决定性阶段。现在，固然已经拒绝了欧洲防务集团条约，但是还必须阻止以任何其他形式使西德重新军国主义化。必须尽一切努力来保障欧洲和平和通过民主与和平的途径来最后解决德国问题。”
    反映拥护“欧洲军”一派的观点的报纸以激怒的口气来报道议会表决的结果，并力图缩小它的意义。
