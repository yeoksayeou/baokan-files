Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, September 9th (TASS):

Comrades!

On behalf of the Soviet people, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the government, I extend warm congratulations to you, and through you, to all the Bulgarian people, on the tenth anniversary of Bulgaria's liberation from fascist enslavement and foreign occupation.

Ten years ago, the Bulgarian people, taking advantage of the Soviet army's defeat of the German army in the Balkans, rose up in a resolute assault on fascism and achieved a glorious and immortal victory.

The armed uprising of September 9, 1944, ushered in a new era in the life of the Bulgarian people. The soul and organizer of this uprising was the glorious Bulgarian Communist Party and its Central Committee, headed by the great son of the Bulgarian people and outstanding activist of the international revolutionary movement, Georgi Dimitrov.

Your victory in September 1944 was the result of the entire historical development process and the natural result of the Bulgarian people's years of struggle for freedom and the independence of their motherland.

The Bulgarian people's love of freedom has a long tradition. In ancient times, the Bulgarian people rose up to defend their national right to independent existence, resisting countless attacks by enemies who attempted to enslave Bulgaria. The Bulgarian people's struggle for national independence in the fourteenth century against the Turkish enslavers who occupied Bulgarian territory is a glorious page in the history of the Bulgarian people. Bulgarian youth flocked to the forests and mountains, taking up arms to fight for the freedom of the people. The exploits of Levski, Botev, and other outstanding sons of Bulgaria, fearless leaders of the Bulgarian national liberation struggle and passionate Bulgarian patriots, will forever remain in the hearts of the people.

The Bulgarian people are worthy of being proud of their revolutionary traditions. The glorious September armed uprising of 1923 is a heroic event in the history of the Bulgarian revolutionary movement. The brutal fascists submerged this uprising in blood, but it played a great role in the subsequent revolutionary awakening of the masses.

Since Hitler's Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union, the nationwide struggle against fascism and foreign occupation in your country has unfolded even more powerfully. On the very next day after the start of this perfidious invasion, the Bulgarian Communist Party issued a declaration calling on the people to rise up in armed struggle against fascism, drive out the Hitlerite occupiers, and oppose Bulgaria's participation in the criminal war on the side of Hitler's Germany. In the autumn of 1941, the Bulgarian Communist Party created the first guerrilla detachment, and in 1943 it developed into the People's Liberation Army, constantly attacking Nazi supply bases, rear areas, and lines of communication, attacking the fascist ruling machine, and annihilating enemy manpower and materiel.

In this way, the Bulgarian people made a valuable contribution to the struggle of peace-loving people around the world against German fascism. Georgi Dimitrov, whose name will live forever, pointed out in talking about the struggle of the Bulgarian people in those years: "This period has written a glorious page in the history of our party and our people. The party and the people can be proud that they have tens of thousands of male and female guerrillas and their assistants, whom the party has organized well and aroused to carry out armed struggle against the German occupiers and Bulgarian fascists."

The victorious uprising of September 9, 1944, was the inevitable result of the Bulgarian people's national liberation struggle; as a result of this uprising, the people seized power from the hands of the royalist fascists. Major historical changes have taken place in the life of the country. Bulgaria has forever broken away from the capitalist world and embarked on the path of democracy and socialism. A new form of government has been established in Bulgaria according to the will of the people. The people themselves have taken control of state power.

Comrades! Amazing changes have taken place in your country in a short period of time. The old monarchical Bulgaria, a backward agricultural and semi-handicraft small-scale production country, a country where the masses of the people had no rights, lived in poverty, where reactionary groups ran rampant, and brought countless suffering and disasters to the Bulgarian people, is gone forever. The present Bulgaria is a free and prosperous country, an independent and autonomous country, which proudly marches forward with other democratic countries along the path of peace, progress, and socialism. Now all the power of the state belongs to the people. All the wealth and all the means of production of the country belong to the working people, who have become the masters of their own destiny and their own country.

In the past ten years, your country has traveled a road in economic terms that would have taken the bourgeois system decades to complete, although the people's democratic government inherited from the old system nothing more than a national economy damaged by war and plundered by Hitlerite bandits. It should also be pointed out that the Bulgarian economy has developed under the frenzied resistance of class enemies, who have tried in every possible way to sabotage the national economy of the country.

But the Bulgarian people have finally overcome the difficulties on their road forward. Bulgaria has become an industrial-agricultural country, with great development in industry and agriculture becoming a large-scale, mechanized, and advanced agriculture.

Under royal rule, Bulgaria only had light industry and the food industry, as well as some extractive industries. Almost all machines and metal products, even simple ones, were imported from abroad.

In the years since the establishment of the people's government, a series of industrial sectors have been newly established in the country, such as machine manufacturing, the electrical industry, the chemical industry, shipbuilding, the mining industry, the iron and steel industry, and the non-ferrous metal industry. The number of industrial products that can be manufactured domestically is increasing, including complex machines and equipment. The output of heavy industry in approximately two months in 1952 was equal to the output for the entire year of 1939. The output of the entire industry exceeds four times the pre-war level. This example shows how rapid the development of Bulgaria's industry has been in the years since the establishment of the people's government, and what great achievements have been made.

The Soviet people share your pride in the achievements of the Bulgarian people.

Since the establishment of the people's government, tremendous changes have also taken place in agriculture, which have a major impact on the future development of the country. The original agriculture was a decentralized small-peasant economy, with arable land divided into millions of small units, and is now gradually transforming into a large-scale, mechanized socialist agriculture.

Now more than half of the farmers have joined agricultural production cooperatives and are operating on a collective basis. Other farmers are gradually convinced of the superiority of this mode of operation through practical life. Everyone knows that cooperative economy, due to the use of machinery and the latest achievements in agricultural technology, has a much higher yield of grain and other crops than individual farmers.

As the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party pointed out last October, although Bulgarian agriculture has made such achievements, it still cannot fully guarantee the needs of residents for food and the needs of the rapidly developing industry for raw materials. Therefore, the Sixth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party took the rapid development of agriculture, especially the elimination of backwardness in animal husbandry, as the most important task of the second Five-Year Plan (1953-1957).

To solve the most important task of improving the material welfare of the Bulgarian people – the main economic task of the second Five-Year Plan as pointed out in the resolution of the Sixth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party – depends to a large extent on whether your country's agriculture can develop successfully and rapidly.

Bulgaria has done a lot of work in improving the material welfare of the people in recent times, such as abolishing the rationing system, reducing the prices of industrial products and food four times, lowering tax rates, and adopting measures to rapidly improve the quality of industrial products and food and expand their varieties. The working farmers have also obtained great preferential treatment and benefits.

All of this proves that concern for the happiness of the working people is the focus of attention of your government and the Communist Party, and is one of the main tasks of the people's state.

There is no doubt that, in this situation, your country will complete the task of greatly improving the material welfare of the working people in a short period of time.

I can assure you that in this great undertaking, the Soviet people will continue to provide the fraternal Bulgarian people with the necessary assistance and support.

The democratic reforms that have been carried out have changed Bulgarian society. Bulgarian society has become more united. The main organizer and driving force of socialist construction – the Bulgarian working class – has grown significantly. Due to the new mission undertaken by the working class and the new changes in social relations, a new attitude to labor has emerged. Workers consciously labor for the happiness of the motherland. The movement of production innovators, rationalization proposers, and advanced producers is developing more and more widely in your country.

Major changes have also taken place in the Bulgarian countryside. The number of rich peasants has decreased, and their past power in the countryside is gone forever. The number of poor peasants has decreased significantly. New socialist peasants – members of agricultural production cooperatives – have emerged and gained a dominant position. In the new countryside of Bulgaria, the future belongs to agricultural production cooperatives. A large number of agricultural workers who have mastered industrial technology – mechanics, tractor drivers, combine operators – have emerged in the countryside. The unshakable, rock-solid foundation of your country's people's democratic system is the unbreakable and powerful worker-peasant alliance. Its strength and firmness arise from the common economic and political interests of workers and peasants, and from the correct policies adopted by the people's government towards the working farmers.

The Bulgarian people have also made significant achievements in developing their culture. Bulgaria has undergone a real cultural revolution. Bulgarian scientists, writers, actors, composers, and artists are constantly contributing to world culture. In recent years, in addition to the old loyal scientific and cultural workers, a new type of people's intellectuals has emerged, who contribute all their strength to serve the people.

Comrades! The Soviet people share your pride in your victories and achievements. With sincere feelings of friendship, the Soviet people are doing everything possible to help you in the arduous and glorious cause of socialist construction.

Bulgaria and the Soviet Union concluded a treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance in 1948. But the friendly relations between our two peoples are far from being contained by the provisions of this treaty.

This friendship, forged in blood by the Bulgarian people and the Russian people fighting shoulder to shoulder against common enemies, and forever living in the hearts of our two peoples, is of greater significance.

The friendship between our two peoples has a long tradition, which has been formed over hundreds of years, and which no one can shake.

The mutual sympathy between the two peoples was powerfully expressed in those difficult years when the Bulgarian people shed blood and sacrificed themselves in a arduous and valiant struggle against the Turkish oppressors.

All progressive Russian public opinion, all good Russian people, stood united and completely on the side of your people at that time, and gave your people all possible support and assistance. The Turkish atrocities in Bulgaria aroused extreme indignation in Russian public opinion.

In those difficult years, the Bulgarian people were deeply convinced that the great Russian people would not ignore the disasters of their brothers, and would come to rescue them from Turkish oppression.

As everyone knows, the deep confidence and hope that the Bulgarian people placed in Russia to fulfill this mission of liberation were fully realized.

As a result of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, Bulgaria obtained the long-awaited national independence. Russian soldiers and Bulgarian militiamen fought side by side in this war, forging a fighting brotherhood friendship between the two peoples in common bloody battles.

During the years of World War II, Bulgarian patriots bravely took up arms and fought against German imperialism. It should be said that an outstanding result of the Bulgarian people's national liberation struggle was that not a single Bulgarian soldier was sent to the Soviet-German war front, despite the insistence of the Hitlerite gang at the time. The Bulgarian ruling group dared not do so, because they did not trust their own army, and did not trust their own people. This is a major contribution of the Bulgarian Communist Party, which launched an army and people's uprising against the adventurous plans of the Bulgarian fascists. The Soviet people will never forget this.

After the liberation of Bulgaria, the Bulgarian armed forces, assigned to the Third Ukrainian Front, participated in the final battle to destroy Hitler's Germany. The military achievements of Bulgarian soldiers and officers, who fought all the way to the foothills of the Austrian Alps, received high praise and thanks from the Soviet Supreme Command.

The friendship between our two peoples is developing and strengthening every year. This is not only due to historical traditions, but also due to the good relations of cooperation and mutual assistance that have been formed between our two peoples, due to common political and economic interests, and due to the common struggle for peace and international understanding.

Our two peoples, who are engaged in peaceful construction labor, resolutely oppose war. In our two countries, war propaganda has been declared the most serious crime against humanity. We advocate peace and international cooperation, advocate peaceful coexistence of all countries, advocate the establishment of collective security including all countries, we uphold these principles, and actively struggle for these principles.

But we must remember that we live in a world divided into two camps. One of the camps is under the rule of capitalism, and the historical characteristic of capitalism is continuous war. The American imperialists, who are trying to mobilize and rally all the reactionary forces of the capitalist world, are today the main instigators and agitators of a new war.

But it is gratifying that more and more people around the world are beginning to recognize the evil and bankruptcy of the American policy of inciting war and hatred among the people of all countries. Thanks to the efforts of peace-loving countries, international tensions have recently eased considerably. The victorious conclusion of the Geneva Conference on the restoration of peace in Indochina is a great victory for the forces of peace. The Geneva Conference has convincingly proven that the key to resolving international disputes and seeking peace and international mutual understanding is not the policy of "strength" but the method of consultation between the countries concerned.

The freedom-loving French people, regardless of any conspiracy by supporters of the "European Army," resolutely rejected the attempt by the American ruling group to involve France in the activities of reviving German militarism. All true peace fighters welcome this news with great satisfaction.

But the victories achieved by peace-loving countries in easing international tensions are not enough for us to believe that the aggressive groups have abandoned their criminal plans to launch a third world war. The advocates of the policy of "strength" on the other side of the Atlantic and their agents in Europe are drawing up new plans to rearm West Germany. They are trying everything to undermine this just-started international cooperation and aggravate international tensions. All this forces peace-loving people to be more vigilant and redouble their efforts to fight for maintaining peace and international security.

The American imperialists are also trying to carry out subversive activities in your country. Bulgaria, which was once a subservient slave in the hands of the imperialist countries, is now a free and independent country, which resolutely resists those who infringe upon its sovereignty, and does not allow anyone to interfere in its internal affairs. This fact makes them furious. We firmly believe that the Bulgarian people, who have already enjoyed freedom, will never allow the imperialists to come to their country to do whatever they want.

Bulgaria's strength lies in itself, in its people who are determined to defend their freedom and independence until the last drop of blood. Bulgaria is strong also because it has the strong support of 900 million people in the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, whose strength is growing day by day. Bulgaria is an equal member of this united and peace-loving family of democratic countries. Our strength lies in unity, in close friendship and cooperation. Given this situation, we are not afraid of any threats and attacks from the aggressors, and it can be predicted that any attempt by the aggressors to infringe upon the sovereignty of any country in the socialist camp is doomed to failure.

Comrades, the political and economic achievements of the Bulgarian people are mostly attributable to the wise leadership of the organizer of socialist construction, the leader and guiding force of the Bulgarian people – the Bulgarian Communist Party. The Communist Party's selfless struggle against fascism during the war years and its loyal service to the people during the peaceful construction years have established great prestige and influence among the broad masses of the Bulgarian people.

The working people of Bulgaria regard the Communist Party as the force that can lead them to the victory of socialism. If the Communist Party continues to strengthen the unity of its ranks, tirelessly improves the ideological and theoretical level and professional ability of its members, and resolutely struggles to implement the principle of collective leadership in the work of party organizations, it will undoubtedly live up to the trust of the people.

The Sixth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party, convened at the beginning of this year, pointed out the magnificent prospects for the further development of Bulgaria's various economic sectors and the significant improvement of the people's cultural welfare.

After the implementation of the second Five-Year Plan for the development of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, your country will take a big step forward on the road of developing the economy and further improving the material conditions of the working people, and on the road to socialism.

There is no doubt that the Bulgarian people, under the leadership of their Communist Party, will accomplish these great and arduous tasks.

I heartily congratulate the Bulgarian people on their new victories in the great cause of building socialism, and in the struggle for peace and international security.

Long live free, independent, and people's democratic Bulgaria!

Long live the fraternal Bulgarian people – the people of builders and creators!

Long live the Bulgarian Communist Party – the victorious organizer of socialist construction!

Long live the unbreakable Soviet-Bulgarian friendship!

    在索非亚举行的保加利亚解放十周年庆祝大会上
    苏联代表团团长萨布罗夫的讲话亲爱的同志们！
    我代表苏联人民、苏联共产党和政府热烈地向你们，并通过你们向全体保加利亚人民祝贺保加利亚摆脱法西斯奴役和外国占领的十周年。
    十年前，保加利亚人民利用苏联军队在巴尔干击溃德国军队的有利时机，奋起向法西斯主义作坚决的冲击，并取得了光荣的功垂不朽的胜利。
    一九四四年九月九日的武装起义展开了保加利亚人民生活的新时代，这次起义的灵魂和组织者就是光荣的保加利亚共产党和以保加利亚人民的伟大的儿子、杰出的国际革命运动活动家格奥尔基·季米特洛夫为首的党中央委员会。
    你们取得的一九四四年九月的胜利是整个历史发展过程的结果，也是保加利亚人民多年来为自由和祖国的独立而奋斗的当然的结果。
    保加利亚人民的热爱自由是有它的悠久的传统的。在古代，保加利亚人民就起来捍卫自己的国家独立生存的权利，抵抗无数企图奴役保加利亚的敌人的袭击。保加利亚人民在十四世纪对侵占了保加利亚领土的土耳其奴役者展开了争取民族独立的斗争，这是保加利亚人民历史上的光荣的一页。保加利亚青年大批地进入森林和山区，拿起武器为人民的自由而战斗。保加利亚民族解放斗争中的无畏的领袖、热情的保加利亚爱国者列夫斯基、鲍切夫和其他保加利亚的杰出的儿子的功勋永远地留在人民的心中。
    保加利亚人民无愧以自己的革命传统而骄傲。一九二三年光荣的九月武装起义就是保加利亚革命运动史中的一个英雄的事件。凶暴的法西斯主义者使这次起义浸沉在血泊中，但这次起义对以后人民群众的革命觉醒起有很大作用。
    自从希特勒德国进犯苏联后，你们国内反对法西斯主义和外国占领的全民斗争更加有力地展开了。就在这一背信弃义的进犯开始的第二天，保加利亚共产党就发表了一个宣言，号召人民起来对法西斯主义进行武装斗争，将希特勒占领者赶出去，反对保加利亚站在希特勒德国一边参加罪恶的战争。一九四一年秋天，保加利亚共产党创建了第一支游击队，一九四三年它发展成为人民解放军，不断地袭击纳粹的供应基地、后方和交通线，袭击法西斯的统治机器，消灭敌人的有生力量和物资。
    保加利亚人民就这样对各国爱好和平人民反对德国法西斯主义的斗争作出了有价值的贡献。英名永垂不朽的格奥尔基·季米特洛夫在谈到保加利亚人民在这些年月中的斗争时指出：“这段时期在我们党和我国人民历史上写下了光辉的一页，党和人民可以值得骄傲的是，它们有着成千成万的男女游击队员和他们的助手，党很好地组织了他们，唤起他们去同德国占领者和保加利亚法西斯分子进行武装斗争。”
    一九四四年九月九日胜利的起义是保加利亚人民民族解放斗争的必然结果；由于这次起义，人民把政权从保皇法西斯分子手中夺取了过来。国家的生活中发生了重大的历史变革。保加利亚永远脱离了资本主义世界，走上了民主和社会主义的道路。按照人民的意志在保加利亚建立了新形式的政府。人民自己掌握了国家政权。
    同志们！你们国家在短短的时期内发生了惊人的变化。旧日的君主专制的保加利亚，一个农业落后和半手工业小生产的国家，一个人民群众没有权利、生活穷困，反动集团肆意横行，并给保加利亚人民带来无数痛苦和灾难的国家一去不复返了。现在的保加利亚是一个自由繁荣的国家，是一个独立自主的国家，它骄傲地和其他民主国家一起沿着和平、进步和社会主义的道路前进。现在国家的全部权力已属于人民。国家的全部财富和全部生产资料已属于成为自己命运和自己国家的全权主人的劳动人民。
    十年来，你们国家在经济方面走过了资产阶级制度要花好几十年才能走完的道路，虽然人民民主政权从旧制度手中所得来的遗产只不过是遭受战争破坏和希特勒匪徒掠夺的国民经济。这里还应当指出，保加利亚经济是在阶级敌人的疯狂反抗下发展起来的，这些阶级敌人曾经千方百计地企图破坏国家的国民经济。
    但是保加利亚人民终于克服了他们前进道路上的困难。保加利亚变成了一个工业农业国，工业有了很大的发展，农业也成了大规模的、机械化的、先进的农业。
    在皇室统治下的保加利亚只有轻工业和食品工业以及一些开采工业。几乎所有机器和金属制品，即使是一些简单的东西，都是从国外输入的。
    在人民政权建立后的年代中，国内新建起了一系列的工业部门，如机器制造业、电器工业、化学工业、造船工业、采矿工业、钢铁工业和有色金属工业。能够自己制造的工业品种类愈来愈多，其中包括复杂的机器和设备。一九五二年重工业约两个月的产品就等于一九三九年全年出产的产品。而整个工业的产量超过战前水平的四倍。由这个例子就可看出，在人民政权建立后的年代中，保加利亚的工业有了多么迅速的发展，取得了多么巨大的成就。
    苏联人民和你们同样为保加利亚人民的成就而感到骄傲。
    自从人民政权建立以来，在农业方面也发生了巨大的变化，这对国家将来的发展有重大的作用。原来的农业是分散的小农经济，耕地划分为数百万块小小的单位，现在正逐渐转变为大规模的、机械化的社会主义农业。
    现在已有一半以上的农民参加了农业生产合作社，在集体的基础上进行经营。其他的农民从实际生活中逐渐相信这种经营方式的优越性。大家都知道，合作社经济由于采用了机器和最新的农业技术成就，它的谷物和其他作物的收成要远比个体农民为高。
    正如去年十月保加利亚共产党中央委员会全体会议所指出的，虽然保加利亚农业取得了这样的成绩，但现在还不能充分地保证居民对食品的需要以及保证迅速发展的工业对原料的需要。因此，保加利亚共产党第六次代表大会把迅速发展农业，特别是消除畜牧业的落后状况作为第二个五年计划（一九五三—一九五七年）的最重要的任务。
    要解决改善保加利亚人民物质福利状况这一最重大的任务——保加利亚共产党第六次代表大会决议中所指出的第二个五年计划的主要的经济任务——在很大程度上要取决于你们国家的农业是否能够胜利地和迅速地发展。
    保加利亚在改善人民的物质福利状况方面最近时期做了不少工作，如取消配给制、四次减低工业品和食品价格、降低税额、采取迅速改进工业品和食品质量以及扩大其种类的措施等。劳动农民也获得了很大的优待和好处。
    所有这些都证明，关心劳动人民的幸福是你们的政府和共产党的注意中心，是人民的国家的主要任务之一。
    毫无疑问，在这种情况下，你们国家将在短期内完成大大提高劳动人民物质福利的任务。
    我可以向你们保证，在这一重大的事业中，苏联人民将继续给予兄弟的保加利亚人民以必需的帮助和支持。
    已经进行的民主改革使保加利亚的社会发生了变化。保加利亚的社会变得更加团结一致了。社会主义建设的主要组织者和推动力——保加利亚工人阶级大大地壮大起来了。由于工人阶级担负了新的使命和社会关系起了新的变化，产生了新的劳动态度。工人为祖国的幸福自觉地进行劳动。生产革新者、合理化建议者和先进生产者的运动在你们国家愈来愈广泛地发展。
    保加利亚的农村也发生了重大的变化。富农的人数减少了，而他们过去在农村中的势力已经一去不复返了。贫农的人数大大地减少了。新的社会主义的农民——农业生产合作社的社员出现了，并取得了优势地位。在保加利亚的新农村中，将来是属于农业生产合作社的。在农村涌现了大批的掌握了工业技术的农业工人——机械师、拖拉机手、联合机操使者。你们国家的人民民主制度的不可动摇的、坚如磐石的基础是牢不可破的、强大的工农联盟。它的力量和坚固性产生于工人和农民的共同的经济和政治利益，产生于人民政府对劳动农民所采取的正确的政策。
    保加利亚人民在发展自己的文化方面也取得了重大的成就。保加利亚进行了真正的文化革命。保加利亚的科学家、作家、演员、作曲家、艺术家正不断对世界文化作出贡献。近几年来，除了旧有的忠实的科学和文化工作者外，还出现了新型的人民的知识分子，他们贡献出自己的全部力量为人民服务。
    同志们！苏联人民和你们一道为你们的胜利和成就而骄傲。苏联人民抱着真挚的友谊的感情，正在尽一切可能帮助你们进行艰巨而光荣的社会主义建设。
    保加利亚和苏联在一九四八年缔结了友好合作互助条约。但是我们两国人民之间的友谊关系远不是这一条约的条文所能包含的。
    在保加利亚人民和俄罗斯人民对共同的敌人并肩作战中用鲜血结成的、永远活在我们两国人民心中的这种友谊是有更大的意义的。
    我们两国人民的友谊有悠久的传统，这种友谊是数百年来结成的，它是无论谁也不能动摇的。
    当保加利亚人民流血牺牲、跟土耳其压迫者作艰苦奋勇的斗争的那些困难年代里，两国人民的互相的同情有力地表现了出来。
    所有进步的俄国公众、全体善良的俄罗斯人民，当时都一致地、完全地站在你们人民的一边，并对你们人民作了一切可能的支持和帮助。土耳其在保加利亚的兽行引起了俄国舆论的极度的愤慨。
    在那些艰难的岁月中，保加利亚人民深深地相信：伟大的俄罗斯人民是不会对他们的兄弟的灾难置之不顾的，是会来把他们从土耳其压迫下解救出来的。
    大家知道，保加利亚人民把这种解放使命寄托在俄国身上的深刻的信心和希望是完全实现了。
    由于一八七七—一八七八年俄土战争的结果，保加利亚获得了长久期待着的民族独立，俄国士兵和保加利亚民兵在这次战争中并肩作战，在共同流血战斗中结成了两国人民战斗的兄弟友谊。
    在第二次世界大战年代中，保加利亚的爱国者勇敢地拿起武器和德国帝国主义斗争。应当说，保加利亚人民的民族解放斗争的出色的成果是：没有一个保加利亚的士兵被派到苏德战争前线上去，尽管当时希特勒匪帮坚持要求。保加利亚统治集团不敢这样做，因为他们不信赖自己的军队，不信赖自己的人民。这是保加利亚共产党的重大功绩，它发动了军队和人民起义，反对保加利亚法西斯的冒险计划。苏联人民永远不会忘记这一点。
    保加利亚解放后，编在乌克兰第三战线军队中的保加利亚武装力量参加了最后摧毁希特勒德国的战斗。一直打到奥地利阿尔卑斯山脚下的保加利亚士兵和军官的战功，受到了苏联最高统帅部很高的评价和感谢。
    我们两国人民之间的友谊每年都在发展和巩固。这不仅是由于历史的传统，而且是由于在我们两国人民之间形成了良好的合作、互助的关系，由于共同的政治和经济利益，以及由于共同为和平和国际谅解而进行的斗争。
    正在从事和平的建设劳动的我们两国人民坚决反对战争。在我们两个国家里，战争宣传被宣布为对人类的最严重的罪行。我们主张和平和国际合作，主张一切国家和平共处，主张建立包括所有国家的集体安全，我们维护这些原则，并为这些原则而积极地斗争。
    但是，我们必须记住，我们是生活在一个分裂成两个阵营的世界上。其中一个阵营是在资本主义的统治之下，资本主义的历史的特征就是连续不断的战争。企图动员和纠合资本主义世界的一切反动势力的美帝国主义者，今天是新战争的主要鼓吹者和煽动者。
    但是，令人欣慰的是，全世界愈来愈多的人民开始认识到美国在各国人民中间煽动战争和仇恨的政策的邪恶和破产。由于爱好和平的国家的努力，最近国际紧张局势已大大缓和。关于恢复印度支那和平的日内瓦会议的胜利结束，是和平力量的一个伟大胜利。日内瓦会议已令人信服地证明了：解决国际争端和谋求和平和国际相互谅解的关键，不是“实力”政策而是由各有关国家进行协商的办法。
    爱好自由的法国人民不顾“欧洲军”支持者的任何阴谋，坚决拒绝了美国统治集团企图使法国参加复活德国军国主义活动的尝试。一切真正的和平战士都以非常满意的心情欢迎这个消息。
    但是，爱好和平的国家在缓和国际紧张局势方面取得的胜利，并不足以使我们认为侵略集团已放弃了他们的发动第三次世界大战的罪恶计划。大西洋彼岸的“实力”政策的鼓吹者和他们在欧洲的代理人已在拟订使西德重新武装的新计划。他们用一切办法竭力来破坏这种刚开始的国际合作，并加剧国际紧张局势。所有这一切使爱好和平的人民不得不提高警惕，加倍努力来为保持和平和国际安全而斗争。
    美帝国主义者也在设法在你们的国家进行颠覆活动。一度是帝国主义国家手中的顺从的奴仆的保加利亚，现在成了一个自由独立的国家，它坚决反抗那些侵犯它的主权的人们，它不准任何人来干涉它的内政，这个事实使他们愤怒不已。我们坚决相信，已经享受到自由的保加利亚人民绝不会容许帝国主义者再来到他们的国家作威作福的。
    保加利亚的力量在于它自己，在于它的决心保卫他们的自由和独立而直到流尽最后一滴血的人民。保加利亚之所以强大还因为它有着力量正在日益壮大的和平、民主和社会主义阵营的九亿人民的强大支持。保加利亚是这个团结一致和爱好和平的民主国家大家庭中的一个平等的成员。我们的力量在于团结一致，在于亲密的友谊和合作，情况既是这样，我们就不害怕侵略者的任何威胁和进攻，可以预言，侵略者打算侵犯社会主义阵营中任何一个国家的主权的任何企图是注定要失败的。
    同志们，保加利亚人民所取得的政治和经济成就，大部分应归功于社会主义建设的组织者、保加利亚人民的领导和指导力量——保加利亚共产党的英明领导。共产党在战争年代中为反对法西斯主义而进行的忘我斗争和在和平建设年代中对人民的忠诚的服务，已使它在广大的保加利亚人民群众中树立了很大的威望，产生了很大的影响。
    保加利亚劳动人民把共产党看作是能够领导他们走向社会主义胜利的力量。如果共产党继续加强它的队伍的团结一致，不倦地提高党员的思想理论水平和业务能力，坚决地为在党组织的工作中贯彻集体领导的原则而斗争，它无疑地将不辜负人民的信任。
    在今年年初召开的保加利亚共产党第六次代表大会，指出了保加利亚各经济部门进一步发展和人民的文化福利显著提高的宏伟前景。
    实现了发展保加利亚人民共和国的第二个五年计划，你们的国家将在发展经济和进一步改善劳动人民的物质条件的道路上，在走向社会主义的道路上向前迈进一大步。
    毫无疑问，保加利亚人民在他们的共产党的领导下，将完成这些伟大的、艰巨的任务。
    我衷心地祝贺保加利亚人民在建设社会主义的伟大事业中，在争取和平和国际安全的斗争中获得新的胜利。
    自由的、独立的、人民民主的保加利亚万岁！
    兄弟般的保加利亚人民——建设者和创造者的人民——万岁！
    保加利亚共产党——社会主义建设的胜利的组织者——万岁！
    牢不可破的保苏友谊万岁！
