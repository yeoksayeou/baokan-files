Xinhua News Agency, 31st. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions' Instruction on Supporting the Joint Declaration of the Democratic Parties and People's Organizations of the People's Republic of China for the Liberation of Taiwan. The full text is as follows:

The Joint Declaration of the Democratic Parties and People's Organizations of the People's Republic of China for the Liberation of Taiwan solemnly declares: "Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan." This is the common will of the 600 million people of our country. The Chinese working class, together with the people of the whole country, warmly supports this declaration and vows to devote all its strength to fight to the end for the sacred historical task of liberating Taiwan.

The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, under the protection of American imperialism, occupies Taiwan, cruelly enslaves the Taiwanese compatriots, and constantly wages harassing and destructive wars against the motherland, undermining our socialist construction. This traitorous clique is conspiring with the American government to sign a so-called "Joint Security Bilateral Treaty" to establish a military alliance, attempting to attack the mainland of the motherland. The Chinese working class and the Chinese people deeply understand that only by liberating Taiwan and eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek clique can we finally complete the historical task of liberating all of China; only by liberating Taiwan and eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique can our ongoing socialist construction and socialist transformation be better guaranteed; only by liberating Taiwan and eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique can the worker brothers and all the Taiwanese compatriots return to the embrace of the motherland's big family and fight with us for the socialist cause of the motherland. Liberating Taiwan is not only for defending our country's security and territorial integrity but also for safeguarding peace in Asia and the world.

In order to enthusiastically respond to and resolutely implement the call of the Joint Declaration of the Democratic Parties and People's Organizations for the Liberation of Taiwan, the Chinese working class must take active action, carry forward the working class's glorious revolutionary tradition and high patriotic spirit, further carry out labor competitions, actively participate in the technical innovation movement, redouble efforts to improve technical and cultural levels, diligently learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, master new technologies, improve product quality, reduce product costs, improve working conditions, ensure production safety, consolidate labor discipline, and strive to increase production and practice economy in all aspects of industrial production, transportation, capital construction, and commodity circulation, to ensure the completion and strive to overfulfill the state plan, and to guarantee the military and civilian needs of the front and the rear. The more contributions we make in production, the more strength we add to the struggle to liberate Taiwan.

Liberating Taiwan is a serious struggle. The Chinese working class must unite more strongly with the people of the whole country, overcome arrogance and impetuosity, heighten revolutionary vigilance, prevent the sabotage activities of special agents and saboteurs, consolidate the rear of the motherland, and ensure the smooth progress of economic construction, to ensure the victorious progress of the struggle to liberate Taiwan.

Trade union organizations at all levels must organically combine the struggle to liberate Taiwan with the current practical work, so that the just struggle to liberate Taiwan becomes a force to promote and improve all work. We must fight to the end to liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and we will never stop until we reach our goal.

Trade union organizations at all levels should report to us the reactions of the broad masses of employees to this joint declaration, as well as your study and discussion of this joint declaration and your work arrangements.

    全国总工会号召全国工人和各级工会组织
    拥护为解放台湾联合宣言
    【新华社三十一日讯】中华全国总工会关于拥护中华人民共和国各民主党派各人民团体为解放台湾联合宣言的指示。全文如下：
    中华人民共和国各民主党派各人民团体为解放台湾联合宣言，庄严地宣告：“台湾是中国的领土，中国人民一定要解放台湾。”这是我国六亿人民的共同意志。中国工人阶级和全国人民一道热烈地拥护这一宣言，并誓以全力为解放台湾这一神圣的历史任务而奋斗到底。
    蒋介石卖国集团在美国帝国主义庇护下窃据台湾，残酷地奴役台湾同胞，不断地对祖国进行骚扰性和破坏性的战争，破坏我国的社会主义建设。这个卖国集团阴谋同美国政府签订所谓“共同安全双边条约”建立军事同盟，妄图进攻祖国大陆。中国工人阶级和中国人民深切地了解：只有解放了台湾，消灭了蒋介石集团，才是最后完成了解放全中国的历史任务；只有解放了台湾，消灭了蒋介石卖国集团，才能使我们正在进行的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业更有保障；只有解放了台湾，消灭了蒋介石卖国集团，才能使台湾的工人兄弟和全体台湾同胞回到祖国大家庭的怀抱中来，与我们一起为祖国的社会主义事业奋斗。解放台湾，不仅是为了保卫我国的安全和领土完整，也是为了保障亚洲及世界的和平。
    中国工人阶级为了热烈地响应并坚决地实现各民主党派各人民团体为解放台湾联合宣言的号召，要积极行动起来，发扬工人阶级光荣的革命传统和高度的爱国主义精神，进一步开展劳动竞赛，积极参加技术革新运动，加倍努力提高技术水平和文化水平，努力学习苏联先进经验，掌握新技术，提高产品质量，降低产品成本，改善劳动条件，保证生产安全，巩固劳动纪律，在工业生产、交通运输、基本建设、商品流转各个方面努力增加生产，厉行节约，保证完成和争取超额完成国家计划，保证前方后方的军需民用。我们在生产上多作一分贡献，就给解放台湾的斗争多增加一分力量。
    解放台湾是一场严重的斗争。中国工人阶级必须与全国人民更加坚强地团结起来，戒骄戒躁，提高革命警惕性，防范特务暗害分子的破坏活动，巩固祖国的后方，保障经济建设事业的顺利进行，以保障解放台湾的斗争得以胜利地进行。
    工会各级组织，要把解放台湾的斗争和当前的实际工作有机地结合起来，使解放台湾的正义斗争成为推动和改进一切工作的力量，我们要为解放台湾消灭蒋介石卖国集团而奋斗到底，不达目的，誓不休止。
    工会各级组织，应将广大职工群众的对于这一联合宣言的反应及你们对于这一联合宣言学习讨论及工作上的布置报告我们。
                    一九五四年八月三十一日
