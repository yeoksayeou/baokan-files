Respected Vice-Chairman, Dear Guests, Comrades and Friends:

It is a great honor for us today to have you all attend this reception celebrating the tenth anniversary of Bulgaria's liberation from fascist enslavement. Please allow me to express my sincere gratitude to you all.

In the struggle of the people of the world for peace and prosperity, our people and the great Chinese people are advancing side by side, and our country has become an integral part of the powerful world peace and democracy camp headed by the great Soviet Union. This makes our people feel fortunate and proud!

Respected guests, please allow me to raise the first glass, to the unbreakable friendship between the Bulgarian and Chinese people, to the further achievements of the Chinese people in the cause of building a happy life, to the glorious Chinese Communist Party, to the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and to the health of the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong!
