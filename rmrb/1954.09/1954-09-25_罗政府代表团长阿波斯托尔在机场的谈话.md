Dear Comrades and Friends!

	We have come to your homeland to participate in the grand celebration of the 5th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Please allow us, on behalf of the government of the Romanian People's Republic, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, and on behalf of the Romanian people, to extend our warm fraternal greetings to the great, hardworking, and heroic Chinese people, to the government of the People's Republic of China, and to the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

	The Romanian people wholeheartedly celebrate this great event. In the glorious history of the Chinese people, it marks the beginning of a new era of freedom and progress.

	As a result of a long and heroic revolutionary struggle for over a century, the Chinese people, five years ago, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, forever ended imperialist enslavement and the rule of feudal forces and bureaucratic capitalism in China. The victory of the Chinese people's revolution has also given strong encouragement to the people of Asia and other countries who are enslaved and fighting for national liberation, and has strengthened the advanced front of all countries led by the Soviet Union for the defense of peace and the liberation of mankind.

	On our way to China, we learned that the National People's Congress of China had passed the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. This constitution marks the magnificent result of the Chinese people's brilliant creative movement and points out a broad road of people's democracy towards socialism for the Chinese people.

	These great victories of the Chinese people have not only aroused the heartfelt joy and support of the 600 million Chinese people, but have also won the joy and support of all working people who are longing for freedom, progress, and world peace.

	The Romanian people warmly congratulate the fraternal Chinese people on winning all the victories in fulfilling the lofty goal of the great socialist construction of their motherland, and warmly wish the Chinese people prosperity and happiness!

	Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Romanian people!

	Long live to the great and heroic Chinese people!

	Long live the People's Republic of China and the government of the People's Republic of China!

	Long live the heroic Chinese Communist Party and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party!

	Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the beloved leader of the Chinese people and the dearest son of the Chinese people!

    罗政府代表团长阿波斯托尔在机场的谈话亲爱的同志们、朋友们！
    我们来到了你们祖国的大地上是为了参加庆祝中华人民共和国成立五周年伟大国庆纪念。请允许我们代表罗马尼亚人民共和国政府、代表罗马尼亚工人党中央并代表罗马尼亚人民向伟大的、勤劳的、英勇的中国人民，向中华人民共和国政府及中国共产党中央致以热烈的兄弟般的敬礼。
    罗马尼亚人民衷心地为这个伟大事件而庆祝。在中国人民的光荣历史上它标志着一个自由与进步的新纪元的开始。
    由于经过一百多年来长期而英勇的革命斗争的结果，就在五年前中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党领导之下永远地结束了帝国主义的奴役，结束了封建势力及官僚资本主义在中国的统治。中国人民革命的胜利同时也给予亚洲及其他各国受着奴役而为争取民族解放斗争的人民以强有力的鼓励并且加强了以苏联为首的各国为保卫和平及人类解放的先进战线。
    在我们来到中国的路途中，我们知道了中国全国人民代表大会已经通过中华人民共和国宪法的消息。这个宪法标志着中国人民光辉的创造性运动的宏伟结果，并且给中国人民指出了一条走向社会主义的人民民主的康庄大道。
    中国人民这些伟大的胜利不仅引起了六亿中国人民衷心欢欣与赞助，并且也赢得了正在渴望自由、进步与世界和平的全体劳动人民的欢欣与赞助。
    罗马尼亚人民热烈祝贺兄弟的中国人民在履行他们祖国伟大社会主义建设的崇高目的中赢得全部的胜利，并热烈地愿中国人民繁荣与幸福！
    中罗两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    伟大而英勇的中国人民万岁！
    中华人民共和国及中华人民共和国政府万岁！
    英勇的中国共产党及中国共产党中央万岁！
    中国人民敬爱的领袖、中国人民最亲爱的儿子毛泽东同志万岁！
