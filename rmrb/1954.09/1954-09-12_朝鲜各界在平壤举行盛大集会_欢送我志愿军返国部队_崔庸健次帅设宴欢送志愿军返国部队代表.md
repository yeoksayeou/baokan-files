The heroic Korean people have given our army great support and cordial care, which has encouraged all commanders and fighters of our army and ensured the victory of our army in battle. Our volunteer army and the troops about to return home will never forget this profound combat friendship, and will further consolidate and develop the friendship and unity with the heroic Korean people and the Korean People's Army, in order to consolidate the victory of the Korean armistice, completely smash any conspiracies and provocations of the aggressors, and strive unremittingly for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue.
