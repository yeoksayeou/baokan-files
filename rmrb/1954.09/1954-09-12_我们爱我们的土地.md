    We Love Our Land
    Shao Yanxiang

    We love our land: for years she has nurtured us, we have irrigated her. We cannot forget those years: how many springs we sowed, how many autumns we reaped with empty hands! How many children had no childhood joy, how many young people lost the happiness of love. On the shattered land, we could not hear the crisp children's songs, we could not hear the sweet love songs. …But then, at that time, the Three Mountains, Five Peaks, Nine Rivers, and Eight Streams
  sang with us songs of grief and indignation,
                  songs of injustice,
                  songs of battle! We rose up—for ourselves, for our children, for our distant and near relatives! We were not free, we fought for freedom! We were enslaved, we wanted to be true human beings! We gathered into a great army. We love our land, she knows how urgent our marching footsteps are—from the south where the wild geese cannot fly, to the north where the south wind cannot blow, she knows how many rivers we have crossed,
          how many mountains we have climbed, how we wiped away the bloodstains on the land, healed the wounds on our bodies; we overcame pursuit and interception, overcame "encirclement and suppression,"
      sneak attacks and open assaults. On the land we love, Chairman Mao led us across great rivers and deep valleys, breaking through dangerous passes and steep ridges; at that time, there were only layers of cave dwellings on the high mountains, Chairman Mao pointed with a smile, saying that this is the model for high-rise buildings. We love those thousands of cave dwellings, we love even more the future high-rise buildings. Living for her, dying for her; for our land, for the beautiful future on the land, we have paid a high price. Our land, is finally our land! No longer a paradise for imperialist adventurers! No longer an item in the overseas accounts of traitors! We declare to the world! The pendulum of history is the people. The Chinese people use their own hands
  to control their own destiny. Our land has also begun a new destiny. We love our land—Anshan, it is a jewel in the palm of our land; not only at night, it shines in the daytime. The steel furnace pours out a waterfall of fire, telling those who mock us: Anshan has both iron and steel, neither growing weeds nor planting sorghum. Fushun, the sea of coal is forever roaring. Back then, the American "envoy" Wedemeyer came to the open-pit mine, he stood here for twenty minutes,
        drooling. Today, there is no place for him to stand. The light signals in the mine shafts are like five-colored flowers, five-colored flowers only open for the miners. The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, at the location designated by Chairman Mao, at the time stipulated by Chairman Mao, next to the foundation stone inscribed by Chairman Mao, the high and low open spaces are being eliminated, steel-helmeted and armored factory buildings stand towards the sky, although not far away there are still shoulder-high weeds, although everywhere you can hear the noisy croaking of frogs. So what! We are building cities around the work sheds, next to the camel caravans,
  letting the trains emit proud roars. We love our land, we love the morning bells on our land. The stars have not yet fallen, the fog is hazy, the bells awaken the people, and the people awaken the land again. In the past, the fields were divided into pieces, like tattered clothes; today, it is boundless, setting off golden, golden waves of wheat... We love this ear of wheat from the agricultural producers' cooperative, it holds sixty-five grains of wheat; it is nourished by a winter's snow water, and snow-white fertilizer. The soil of China is warm soil, what good seeds cannot germinate? We love our land, we love the prosperous famous cities, the fertile fields, we also love the remote places waiting to be developed. Survey team members were dispatched from Beijing,
  and geological exploration team members, in their 1:50,000 scale maps, in their letters written to their loved ones on birch bark, they wrote many things we don't yet know. --Enviable comrades, please tell me:
    How vast is our land,
                how fertile,
                how rich! From one industrial base to another, the road is long under our feet; there are also many positions. Some have reached the campsite, some are setting off; some meet old comrades on the construction site, some have to part ways. This is China's Siberia, the vast wilderness will become a cradle of gold; that is China's Kuznetsk, cities and gardens will be born in the forest; this is China's Kuibyshev Hydropower Station, that is China's Ukrainian black earth plain... More than 9.59 million square kilometers - our beloved land! We build her, we also defend her. We have hands to drive tractors, and eyes to drive tanks. We are 600 million, we are far more than 600 million: from Beijing to Moscow, from Pyongyang to Prague, from the banks of the Red River to the banks of the Elbe, from peace-loving hearts to peace-loving hearts, this is our front. On our land, we are building a strong and prosperous socialist motherland. Even if there are many, many Twenty-Five Thousand Lis! The Communist Party and Chairman Mao lead us. We are moving forward in the cheers of friends. We are moving forward in the curses of enemies. Moving forward to the victory of the First Five-Year Plan! Moving forward to the victory of the Second Five-Year Plan! Moving forward to the victory of the Third Five-Year Plan! Forward! Let the world hear our footsteps!

### 我们爱我们的土地

    我们爱我们的土地
    邵燕祥我们爱我们的土地：多少年来她哺养着我们，我们灌溉着她。我们忘不了那些年代：多少个春天我们播种，多少个秋天我们两手空空！多少个孩子没有童年的欢乐，多少个青年失去幸福的爱情。在破碎的土地上，听不见清脆的儿歌，听不见甜蜜的情歌。……但是啊，那时候，三山五岳九江八河
  跟我们一同唱起悲愤的歌，
                  不平的歌，
                  战斗的歌！我们起来了——为我们自己，为我们的孩子，为我们远远近近的亲人！我们不自由，我们争取自由！我们被奴役，我们要做真正的人！我们聚成了一支大军。我们爱我们的土地，她知道我们行军的脚步多么急切——从北雁飞不到的南方，到南风吹不到的塞北，她知道我们趟过多少条河，
          爬过多少座山，怎样擦去土地上的血迹，养好自己身上的伤痕；战胜了追截堵杀，战胜了“围剿”、“扫荡”，
      偷袭和明攻。在我们所爱的土地上，毛主席带领着我们越过大河深谷，突破险关峻岭；那时候，高山上只有层层叠叠的窑洞，毛主席含笑指点，说这就是高楼大厦的模型。我们爱那千万孔窑洞，我们更爱那未来的高楼大厦。生为她，死为她；为了我们的土地，为了土地上美好的未来，我们付出了高昂的代价。我们的土地，到底是我们的土地了！再不是帝国主义冒险家的乐园了！再不是卖国贼海外存折里的项目了！我们向全世界宣告！历史的钟摆是人民。中国人民用自己的双手
  掌握了自己的命运。我们的土地也开始了新的命运。我们爱我们的土地——鞍山啊，这是我们土地上的一颗掌上明珠；不光在夜里，它白天也放着光芒。炼钢炉倾泻着火的瀑布，告诉那些嘲笑我们的家伙：鞍山有铁又有钢，既没生野草，也没种高粱。抚顺啊，煤的海永远在喧腾。想当年美国“特使”魏德迈来到露天矿，他在这儿呆立了二十分钟，
        垂涎三尺。今天却再没他站脚的地方。矿坑里的灯光信号像五色的花，五色的花只为矿工开放。第一汽车制造厂啊，在毛主席指定的地点，在毛主席规定的时间，在毛主席题字的基石旁边，高高低低的空地正在消灭，钢盔铁甲的厂房矗向天空，虽然不远还有平肩高的蔓草，虽然到处听得见吵闹的蛙鸣。那怕什么！我们正是在工棚周围筑起城市，在骆驼队旁边，
  让火车发出自豪的吼声。我们爱我们的土地，爱我们土地上早晨的钟声。星星还没落，雾气濛濛，钟声就唤醒人们，人们又把土地唤醒。从前田野分割成一片一片，好像那破烂的衣裳；今天它啊一望无边，掀起金黄的、金黄的麦浪……我们爱这棵农业生产合作社的麦穗，它衔着六十五颗麦粒；滋养它的是一冬的雪水，还有雪白雪白的肥田粉。中国的土壤是温暖的土壤，有什么美好的种籽不能萌芽？我们爱我们的土地，我们爱繁华的名城，丰饶的田野，我们也爱那偏远的、等待着开垦的地方。从北京派出了测量队员，
  和地质勘探队员，在他们五万分之一的测绘图里，在他们用桦树皮给爱人写的信里，写着许多我们还不知道的事情。——可羡慕的同志们，请告诉我：
    我们的土地是多么广大、
                多么肥沃、
                多么丰富啊！从一个工业基地，到另一个工业基地，道路在我们脚下很长；岗位也很多。有些人到达了宿营地，有些人正在出发；有些人在工地遇到老战友，有些人又要分手上路。这儿是中国的西伯利亚，茫茫的原野将变成黄金的摇篮；那儿是中国的库兹涅茨克，森林里将诞生城市和花园；这儿是中国的古比雪夫水电站，那儿是中国的乌克兰黑土平原……九百五十九万多方公里——我们亲爱的土地！我们建设她，我们还要保卫她。我们有开拖拉机的双手，还有开坦克的眼光。我们是六万万，我们远不止六万万：从北京到莫斯科，从平壤到布拉格，从红河两岸到易北河滨，从爱好和平的心到爱好和平的心，这就是我们的阵线。我们在我们的土地上，建设着强大繁荣的社会主义祖国。哪怕有很多很多的二万五千里！共产党、毛主席领导着我们。我们在朋友的欢呼中前进。我们在敌人的诅咒中前进。向第一个五年计划的胜利前进！向第二个五年计划的胜利前进！向第三个五年计划的胜利前进！前进！让全世界倾听我们的脚步声吧！
