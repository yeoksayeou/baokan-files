Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 22nd: The Hubei Province recently held a disaster area work conference, which determined that the main task in the disaster areas is to strive for a rapid restoration of production, to lead the disaster victims in implementing self-salvation through production, and to actively carry out mutual aid and cooperation movements. During the discussion of specific tasks in the disaster areas, the conference required all localities to earnestly carry out the work of returning disaster victims in non-disaster areas to their hometowns to rebuild their homes. It also required relevant areas to establish organizations to welcome and support disaster victims returning home and to prepare various materials necessary for the disaster victims after returning home. The conference decided to launch a production campaign focusing on agriculture, seize the opportunity to do a good job in this year's winter sowing. In terms of water conservancy projects, the policy of "closing breaches and restoring embankments, with key reinforcement" was adopted. Priority was given to actively repairing the embankments destroyed by floods and reinforcing key embankments such as the Jingjiang Dike. At the same time, it is necessary to ensure the food supply for the disaster victims and vigorously carry out the purchase and sale of local and special products. The conference also discussed the issue of compensating the people in the flood diversion area for the loss of farmland production.

Also, farmers in the flood-affected areas of Hubei Province are actively carrying out a self-salvation through production campaign. In more than 90% of the mountainous flood-affected areas, after washing seedlings, replanting, and rushing to plant, farmers are now busy with the autumn harvest, and have already sown late autumn crops such as buckwheat, mung beans, and velvet beans. Farmers in waterlogged areas are working hard to drain water and rush to plant. Farmers in the Jingzhou Special District have carried out autumn sowing on more than 60% of the land where the water has receded and drained. Farmers in some areas where the water has not yet receded and those resettled in non-disaster areas have generally carried out production activities such as reclaiming wasteland, fishing, collecting firewood, picking water caltrop, and digging medicinal herbs. Under the leadership of mutual aid and cooperative organizations, the disaster victims are finding more and more ways to engage in production, with agriculture as the main focus. In Miaozhu Township, Huangmei County alone, the disaster victims have found 22 kinds of production opportunities, such as fishing, reclaiming wasteland, and carrying bamboo and wood. Due to the diversified agricultural and sideline production carried out by the disaster victims in Liuhe Township, Puchi County, the income earned in 21 days was sufficient to meet the living expenses of all the disaster victims for 40 days. The Tang Damei Mutual Aid Group in Jiayu County, after a month of self-salvation through production, has not only solved the living difficulties of the entire group but also has 1.2 million yuan left to expand production.

In order to support the disaster victims' self-salvation through production, the Provincial People's Bank has allocated more than 210 billion yuan in loans. State-owned commercial and cooperative departments are vigorously supplying the disaster victims with various production and living materials needed and purchasing various agricultural and sideline products by organizing mobile sales groups to deliver goods by boat and setting up more purchase and supply stations. Within 50 days, Hanchuan County alone supplied more than 2.55 billion yuan worth of means of production.

    湖北灾区工作会议决定迅速恢复灾区生产
    水灾地区农民积极开展生产自救运动
   【新华社武汉二十二日电】湖北省最近召开了灾区工作会议，确定了灾区主要工作任务是争取迅速恢复生产，领导灾民实行生产自救，并积极开展互助合作运动。会议在讨论灾区各项具体工作时，要求各地认真地做好转移在非灾区的灾民还乡重建家园的工作，要求有关地区成立迎接和支援灾民回乡的机构，准备好灾民回家后所必需的各种物资。会议决定在生产上要开展以农业为主的生产运动，抓紧时机做好今年冬播工作。在水利工程方面，采取“堵口复堤，重点加固”的方针，分别轻重缓急，积极修复被洪水毁坏的堤岸和重点加固荆江大堤等主要堤防。同时，要保证灾民粮食供应，大力做好土产特产的收购和推销工作。会议还讨论了补偿分洪区人民田地产量的损失问题。
    【又讯】湖北省水灾区农民积极开展生产自救运动。百分之九十以上的山洪灾害地区，农民在进行洗苗和补种、抢种后，现在正忙秋收，并已播种了荞麦、绿豆、泥豆等晚秋作物。积水地区农民正在努力排水、赶种。荆州专区农民已在百分之六十以上的退水田和排出水的地上进行了秋种。部分暂未退水地区和安置在非灾区的农民已普遍开展开荒、捕鱼、打柴、摘菱角、挖药材等生产活动。各地在互助合作组织带头下，灾民们以农业为主的生产门路愈找愈多。仅黄梅县苗竹乡一个乡的灾民就找到打鱼、开荒、挑竹木等二十二种生产门路。蒲圻县六合乡灾民由于进行了多种农业副业生产，二十一天内所得足供全体灾民四十天的生活。嘉鱼县汤大梅互助组经过一个月的生产自救，除解决了全组生活困难外，尚余一百二十万元准备扩大生产。
    为了支持灾民生产自救，省人民银行已拨下贷款二千一百多亿元。国营商业和合作社部门正在用组织送货船流动购销组，增设收购供应站等办法大力供应灾民所需的各种生产和生活资料，收购各种农业副业产品。汉川县五十天内就供应了价值二十五亿多元的生产资料。
