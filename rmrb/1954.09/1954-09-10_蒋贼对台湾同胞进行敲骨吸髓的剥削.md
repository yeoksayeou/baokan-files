The Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Group Ruthlessly Exploits the Taiwanese People

Farmers Suffer Cruel Exploitation

The Chiang Kai-shek bandit group is carrying out a ruthless exploitation of Taiwanese farmers.

After the Japanese surrender, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique took over and occupied a large amount of land that the Japanese imperialists had plundered from Taiwanese farmers, turning it into its so-called "public land," and continued to exploit farmers like the Japanese imperialists. In January of last year, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique began to implement a deceptive so-called "Land to the Tiller" program in Taiwan. The method was to force Taiwanese farmers to purchase some "public land" and land acquired from small landlords, the elderly, weak, orphans, and the disabled, using empty promises of "in-kind land bonds" and stocks of Chiang's bureaucratic capitalist enterprises, as well as barren land that landlords were willing to sell. Farmers must pay 30 percent of the total harvest from the cultivated land annually for ten years as land price and interest. Taiwanese newspapers admitted that after the implementation of the so-called "Land to the Tiller" program, the burden on Taiwanese farmers was heavier than before. The land price, land price interest, field tax, public school grain, defense donation, household tax, water rent, deed tax, and notarization fee, these nine taxes alone, which they are forced to pay in rice, account for 43.61 percent of the total annual harvest. Recently, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit group announced an increase of 50 percent in land prices. This will make the lives of Taiwanese farmers even more difficult. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit group also stipulates that farmers must pay the land price and taxes on time. Even if it is overdue by less than a month, a fine will be charged, and the amount of the fine will increase monthly. Those who are more than four months overdue will be imprisoned.

In addition to this, Taiwanese farmers are also extorted for many miscellaneous fees by pseudo-regimes at the county and township levels, and pseudo-farmers' associations, water conservancy associations, etc. In Nantou County, the pseudo-farmers' association alone extorts so-called "technical guidance fees" from sugarcane farmers, accounting for 14 percent of farmers' income from growing sugarcane. Many cultivated lands in Taiwan are mountainous. In addition to being forced to pay high water rents, farmers must also rent water pumps from Chiang's bureaucratic officials and landlords at high rents for irrigation. In Pingtung County, farmers pay 960 kilograms to 1,800 kilograms of rice annually for renting water pumps to irrigate one hectare (approximately 15 mu) of cultivated land, which is about 19 to 36 percent of the annual harvest per hectare of rice fields that can be harvested twice a year in Pingtung County. The water pump rental fees in Kaohsiung County are similar to those in Pingtung County.

The Chiang Kai-shek bandit group's cruel exploitation has left Taiwanese farmers heavily in debt. The "China Economy" monthly published in Taiwan admits: "Farmers already have debts. As soon as the harvest comes, all the rice has been used to pay off debts, and the deadline for land price collection is approaching. They have no choice but to borrow high-interest loans and be exploited." At present, the interest rates on usurious loans in Taiwan are very high. In Hualien County, it is common to borrow 100 catties of grain at planting time and repay 200 catties at harvest time. During times of grain shortage, it is even common to borrow one and repay three. Due to their inability to make a living, Taiwanese farmers are increasingly forced to abandon their cultivated land and flee from famine.

Salt Field Workers Live in Extreme Poverty

Under the corrupt rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit group, Taiwan's salt industry is declining. According to Taiwanese newspapers, Taiwan produced 161,966 metric tons of salt in 1953, a decrease of 87,283 metric tons compared to the average annual production of 249,249 metric tons from 1941 to 1951, a reduction of 35 percent.

Under the plunder of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit group, many salt fields in Taiwan are becoming increasingly desolate. Lukang Salt Field is the only salt field in central Taiwan that has been operating for more than 50 years. Of the approximately 4,000 mu of salt fields in this salt field, approximately 1,100 mu have been abandoned and cannot be produced. The remaining salt fields are also suffering from declining production because the pseudo-Taiwan Salt Manufacturing General Plant refuses to repair them, claiming "depleted financial resources." The Chiang Kai-shek bandit group recently plans to convert the salt fields of this salt field into farmland, which will make it impossible for more than 1,000 salt workers and their families, who have made a living by salt production for generations, to survive.

At present, the lives of Taiwanese salt workers are extremely difficult. According to the figures published after the first phase of the "Household Survey of Salt Workers in the Province" recently conducted by the pseudo-Taiwan Provincial "Social Affairs Department" and the pseudo-Taiwan Salt Manufacturing General Plant, 89.3 percent of the salt workers surveyed are in debt. 99.6 percent of salt workers lack cotton clothes, 85.7 percent lack cotton quilts, and 96.4 percent lack mosquito nets. The vast majority of salt workers suffer from several occupational diseases. Among the salt workers surveyed, 75.7 percent suffer from eye diseases and 61.4 percent suffer from foot diseases.

Drought Makes Farmers' Lives More Miserable

Taiwan, under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit group, has suffered a severe drought this year. Since the beginning of April, there has been very little rain in Taiwan. Some places have not had any rain so far. The affected areas include Keelung, Taipei, Taoyuan, Miaoli, and Hsinchu in the north, Taichung in the central region, and Kaohsiung and Pingtung in the south. Jin Yanghao, the pseudo-Taiwan Provincial Director of Agriculture and Forestry, admitted that 23,000 hectares (approximately 15 mu per hectare) of farmland have been affected, accounting for one-twentieth of the total cultivated area in Taiwan. However, according to Agence France-Presse, the affected farmland reaches 28,000 hectares.

The most severely affected area is the northwest of Taiwan, which is the richest in rice production. According to Taiwanese newspapers, many paddy fields have not been able to transplant rice seedlings due to the drought, with as many as 10,000 hectares in Taoyuan County alone, and the average harvest will be less than 30 percent. In Hongmao Township, Hsinchu County, about one-third of the first crop of rice has been lost due to the drought, and the second crop cannot be planted at all. The local ponds and wells have dried up, and bamboo forests, trees, livestock, and poultry have died of thirst. In Taichung County in central Taiwan, at least 2,000 to 3,000 hectares of farmland cannot be planted with the second crop of rice.

The water sources for tap water and hydropower generation in Taiwan have dried up. The supply of tap water in Keelung City is only one-quarter of the normal level. Some places do not get water at all between 6:00 AM and 12:00 PM. The water level of Sun Moon Lake, the largest water source for hydropower generation in Taiwan, has dropped to about seven feet, only one-tenth of the highest water level, so the power supply is facing serious difficulties. The pseudo-Ministry of Economic Affairs has announced that it will implement power rationing throughout Taiwan starting from September 1st.

This year's unprecedented drought in Taiwan has made the lives of Taiwanese farmers, who have been exploited and oppressed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit group for many years, even more miserable. Taiwanese newspapers revealed that farmers in the affected areas are in a state of hunger and thirst, and some people are relying on wild plants to survive. However, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit group has not provided any relief to the disaster victims, but has instead stepped up the collection of taxes from them. The so-called water conservancy agencies only know how to ask farmers for money, and have not actually done anything good for the farmers. Taiwanese newspapers also admitted that the so-called water conservancy agencies are controlled by powerful figures who disregard the interests of farmers. Moreover, the benefit fees collected are too high, and after they are collected, they are arbitrarily wasted and not used to repair water conservancy projects. The corrupt and tyrannical rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit group has clearly deepened the disaster caused by this drought.

Insect Plague Develops to a Serious Extent

Because the Chiang Kai-shek bandit group only knows how to exploit Taiwanese farmers and does not take measures to prevent disasters, the insect plague in some places in southern Taiwan has developed to a fairly serious extent. According to Taiwanese newspapers, the area of dry rice affected by locust plagues in Annan District, Central District, South District, and North District of Tainan County has reached 600 hectares. Among them, the disaster situation in Heshun, Gongweng, and Nanxing areas of Annan District is particularly serious, with affected farmland reaching 500 hectares, accounting for one-third of the dry rice planting area in the entire district.

In addition, the paddy fields in the coastal area of Pingtung County have also been damaged by saltwater centipedes. In this area, more than 250 hectares of rice-growing land have been damaged by saltwater centipedes, and the rice roots have been gnawed.

    蒋贼对台湾同胞进行敲骨吸髓的剥削
    农民遭到残酷的剥削
    蒋介石卖国集团正在对台湾农民实行敲骨吸髓的剥削。
    在日本投降以后，蒋介石卖国集团曾将日本帝国主义者从台湾农民手中掠夺得来的大量土地接收过来占为己有，变成它的所谓“公地”，并继续像日本帝国主义者一样剥削农民。去年一月，蒋介石卖国集团开始在台湾实行欺骗性的所谓“耕者有其田”，办法是把一部分“公地”和用空头支票“实物土地债券”和蒋匪官僚资本企业的股票向小土地出租者、老弱孤寡残废者收购来的土地，以及地主愿意出卖的瘦地，强迫台湾农民购买。农民须在十年内每年付出占耕地总收获量百分之三十的地价和利息。台湾报纸承认，在实施所谓“耕者有其田”后，台湾农民的负担比前更加加重，每年单是被迫用稻谷缴纳的地价、地价利息、田赋、公学粮、防卫捐、户税、水租、契税、监证费这九项捐税，即占全年总收获量的百分之四十三点六一。最近蒋介石卖国集团又宣布将地价增加百分之五十。这样就将使台湾农民的生活更加困苦。蒋介石卖国集团并规定农民必须按期缴付地价和赋税，即使逾期未满一个月，也要加收罚金，罚金额逐月递增，逾期满四个月者就要被拉去坐牢。
    除此之外，台湾农民还被县乡各级伪政权和伪农会、水利会等勒索许多杂费。在南投县，伪农会单以所谓“技术指导费”向蔗农勒索的款项，占农民种植甘蔗的收入的百分之十四。台湾许多耕地都是山地，农民除了被迫缴纳高额的水租外，还要向蒋匪官僚和地主以高额的租金租用抽水机灌溉。在屏东县，农民灌溉一公顷（每公顷约合十五市亩）耕地，每年要缴抽水机租金九百六十公斤至一千八百公斤稻谷，约为屏东县每年能收两季的稻田每公顷收获量的百分之十九至百分之三十六。高雄县的抽水机租金也和屏东县差不多。
    蒋介石卖国集团的残酷剥削，使台湾农民负债累累。台湾出版的“中国经济”月刊承认：“农民原有欠债，甫一收获，所有稻谷已偿还殆尽，而地价催征期已届，只得举借高利贷，任人剥削”。目前台湾高利贷的利息很高。在花莲县，一般在播种时借谷一百斤，收获时要还二百斤，在粮荒期间，甚至有借一还三的。台湾农民由于无法生活，被迫抛弃耕地逃荒者日益增加。
    盐场工人生活极为困苦
    在蒋介石卖国集团的腐朽统治下，台湾盐业生产日趋衰落。据台湾报纸透露，一九五三年台湾产盐十六万一千九百六十六公吨，比一九四一年至一九五一年平均年产量二十四万九千二百四十九公吨减少了八万七千二百八十三公吨，即减产百分之三十五。
    在蒋介石卖国集团的掠夺之下，台湾许多盐场日益荒废。鹿港盐场是台湾中部开办已有五十多年的唯一盐场。这个盐场的约四千市亩盐田中，已有约一千一百市亩荒废不能生产。其余盐田也因伪台湾制盐总厂以“财源枯竭”为名不肯修理，以致产量日减。蒋介石卖国集团最近更计划将这个盐场的盐田改为农田，这将使盐场内世代以晒盐为业的一千多盐工及其家属无法生活。
    目前台湾盐工的生活极为困苦。根据伪台湾省“社会处”和伪台湾制盐总厂最近举办的“全省盐工家计调查”第一期抽查后发表的数字，被调查的盐工中有百分之八十九点三负有债务。缺乏棉衣的盐工占百分之九十九点六，缺乏棉被的占百分之八十五点七，缺乏蚊帐的占百分之九十六点四。绝大部分盐工都患有几种职业病。在被调查的盐工中，有百分之七十五点七患有眼病，百分之六十一点四足部患病。
      旱灾使农民生活更悲惨了
    在蒋介石卖国集团统治下的台湾，今年遭受了严重的旱灾。自四月上旬到现在，台湾各地下雨极少。有的地方至今没有下雨。受灾地区包括北部的基隆、台北、桃园、苗栗、新竹，中部的台中，南部的高雄、屏东等地。伪台湾省农林厅长金阳镐承认，受灾农田有两万三千公顷（每公顷约合十五市亩），占台湾全省耕地面积的二十分之一。但据法新社估计，受灾农田达两万八千公顷。
    受灾最严重的地区是产米最丰富的台湾西北部。据台湾报纸透露，很多水田因干旱未能插秧，仅桃园县一地即有一万公顷之多，平均收成将不到三成。在新竹县红毛乡，第一期稻作因旱灾损失的已约有三分之一，第二期稻作完全不能播种。该地池水、井水均已干涸，竹林、树林、家畜、禽兽渴死。在台湾中部的台中县，至少有二、三千公顷农田第二期稻作无法插秧。
    台湾各地自来水和水力发电的水源干涸。基隆市的自来水供应量只及平时的四分之一。有的地方从早上六时到下午十二时之间根本得不到水。台湾水力发电最大水源地日月潭的水位，已下降到七尺左右，只及最高水位的十分之一，因此电力供应发生严重困难。伪经济部已宣布自九月一日起在全台湾实行限制用电。
    台湾今年的空前旱灾，使遭受蒋介石卖国集团多年剥削压榨的台湾农民生活更为悲惨。台湾报纸透露，受灾地区的农民已处于饥渴交迫的境地中，有的人已依靠野生植物维持生活。但是蒋介石卖国集团并未给予灾民以任何救济，反而加紧向他们催征赋税。所谓水利机关也只知向农民伸手要钱，实际上没有为农民办任何好事。台湾报纸也承认，所谓水利机关都为有势力分子所把持，毫不顾及农民的利益，而且征收的受益费过重，收来以后又恣意浪费，并没有用来修缮水利工程。蒋介石卖国集团的腐朽暴虐统治，显然加深了这次旱灾的灾情。
    虫灾发展到严重的程度
    由于蒋介石卖国集团一味剥削台湾农民而不采取措施防治灾害，台湾南部若干地方的虫灾已发展到相当严重的程度。据台湾报纸透露，在台南县的安南区、中区和南北区，遭受蝗虫灾害的陆稻面积已达六百公顷。其中以安南区的和顺、公翁、南兴一带的灾情特别惨重，受害的农田达五百公顷，占全区陆稻种植面积的三分之一。
    此外，屏东县沿海一带的水田也遭受到盐水蜈蚣的灾害，这一地区有二百五十余公顷种稻子的地被盐水蜈蚣穿孔破坏，稻根受到啮食。
