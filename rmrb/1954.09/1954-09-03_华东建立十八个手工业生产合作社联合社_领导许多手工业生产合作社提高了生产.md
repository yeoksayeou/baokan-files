East China Establishes Eighteen Joint Federations of Handicraft Production Cooperatives, Leading Many Handicraft Production Cooperatives to Improve Production

A number of joint federations of handicraft production cooperatives have been successively established in areas with a relatively high concentration of handicrafts in East China. According to preliminary statistics, eighteen joint federations of production cooperatives have been established in the region. Among them, there are three preparatory committees for provincial (municipal) level production federations in Shanghai and Anhui, seven prefectural-level production federations in cities like Jinan, Fuzhou, and Hangzhou, and eight county (city) level production federations in areas like Weifang and Wujin. These production federations have played a significant role in consolidating and improving handicraft cooperative organizations and promoting the socialist transformation of handicrafts.

Most of these production federations have established supply and marketing business institutions to help grassroots handicraft production cooperatives solve some problems in supplying raw materials and marketing products. The Shanghai Municipal Production Federation's Supply and Marketing Department centrally purchases some raw materials and exclusively sells some products for grassroots production cooperatives, and also organizes unified external marketing. In the first quarter of this year, the total value of finished products marketed by the department for production cooperatives reached 48.2 billion yuan, accounting for 63.5 percent of the total sales of grassroots production cooperatives.

The production federations in Weifang City, Shandong Province, and other places have implemented the policy of being production-oriented, regularly going deep into grassroots production cooperatives to inspect product quality and other work, and promoting the improvement of production in many grassroots production cooperatives. The Jiangyin County Cotton Cloth Production Federation in Jiangsu Province organized grassroots production cooperatives to carry out red banner competitions and conducted quarterly evaluations. The average rate of substandard cloth of the Huashu Cotton Cloth Production Cooperative in the county was 24 percent in the second quarter of 1952, but it has been reduced to 1.81 percent in the second quarter of this year. The cost of each piece of serge fabric in the Sanjiali Production Cooperative in the county has been reduced by more than 8,900 yuan, and the contracts have been completed on time. The Linqing Town Production Federation in Shandong Province regularly holds technical seminars and organizes grassroots production cooperatives to exchange experiences. Through the exchange of technology, the daily output per person in the town's cotton weaving production cooperative increased from 80 feet of cloth to 120 feet. The shoemaking production cooperative promoted the use of the "bottoming machine," increasing production efficiency by 30 percent. The production federations in Shanghai, Fuzhou, Jiangyin, and other places have also held training courses to provide political and technical education to cadres and members of grassroots production cooperatives.

    华东建立十八个手工业生产合作社联合社
    领导许多手工业生产合作社提高了生产
    华东区手工业比较集中的地区已先后建立起一批手工业生产合作社联合社。据初步统计，全区已建立生产合作社联合社十八个，其中上海、安徽等地的省（市）级生产联社筹委会有三个，济南、福州、杭州等地的省辖市级生产联社有七个，潍坊、武进等地的县（市）级生产联社有八个。这些生产联社对巩固和提高手工业合作组织，促进手工业的社会主义改造起了相当大的作用。
    这些生产联社大都设立了供销业务机构，帮助基层手工业生产合作社解决了供应原料、推销产品中的一些问题。上海市生产联社供销经理部为基层生产社统一采购一部分原料，包销一部分产品，并且统一对外组织推销；今年第一季度，该经理部为生产社推销的成品总值达四百八十二亿元，占各基层生产社销售总值的百分之六十三点五。
    山东省潍坊市等地的生产联社贯彻了面向生产的方针，经常深入基层生产社进行检查产品质量等工作，推动许多基层生产社改进了生产。江苏省江阴县棉布生产联社组织各基层生产社开展红旗竞赛，按季进行评比。该县华墅棉布生产社一九五二年第二季度的平均副布率为百分之二十四，今年第二季度已降低为百分之一点八一；该县三甲里生产社每匹哔叽格布的成本降低八千九百多元并做到了按期完成合同。山东省临清镇生产联社定期召开技术研究会，组织基层生产社交流经验。该镇棉织生产社通过交流技术，每人每天的生产量由八十尺布提高到一百二十尺；鞋工生产社推广使用了“砌底机”，生产效率提高百分之三十。上海、福州、江阴等地的生产联社还举办训练班，对基层生产社的干部和社员进行了政治和技术的教育。
