The Great Decade
By F. Topincharov, Editor-in-Chief of the Bulgarian "Fatherland Front Newspaper"

September 9th this year marks the tenth anniversary of Bulgaria's liberation from fascist oppression and imperialist enslavement.

Located at the intersection of Europe and Asia, Bulgaria has a thousand-year history filled with significant events. For the Bulgarian people, September 9, 1944, was like October 1, 1949, for the Chinese people, the greatest day. This day is the dividing line between a society of class oppression and a society without exploitation of man by man.

Ten years ago on this day, the Bulgarian People's Anti-Fascist Armed Uprising led by the Bulgarian Communist Party was victorious. The bourgeois and royal fascist regime was overthrown, and power transferred to the hands of the vast majority of the people—the workers and working peasants. This greatest victory in Bulgarian history was achieved thanks to the decisive assistance of the Soviet Union and the Soviet Union's victorious advance in the Balkans, which annihilated the Nazi troops then occupying Bulgaria.

After the victory of September 9th, the Bulgarian regime, which had been a tool of the ruling class to suppress and plunder the masses, became a tool in the hands of the people to eliminate capitalism and its exploitation, build socialism, and ensure the happiness of the Bulgarian people. All democratic and patriotic forces united under the banner of the Fatherland Front, under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party. The decade from 1944 to 1954 was filled with major social, economic, political, and cultural events that changed the face of Bulgaria's land and people's lives. Looking back at these changes, we can call this period "The Great Decade." Comrade Dimitrov, the leader of the Bulgarian Communist Party and guide of the past decade, once pointed out that it is necessary to "complete the tasks that other countries have accomplished in a hundred years under different conditions within fifteen to twenty years, through industrialization and electrification, and through agricultural mechanization." This is the road that the People's Democratic Bulgaria has traversed and achieved in the past decade.

In just ten years, Bulgaria has changed greatly. Ten years ago, it was an agricultural country—agriculture accounted for 66.2 percent of the country's total production, while industry accounted for only 33.8 percent. This shows that Bulgaria was a backward agricultural country with underdeveloped industry in the past. Bulgaria's total arable land amounted to ten million acres, scattered in twelve million small plots, and agricultural output was very low. Light industry (sugar making, canning, and textiles) occupied a major position in industry, and technology was primitive and backward. For these reasons, Bulgaria was completely dependent on foreign enterprises in the past. German, French, British, and American capital controlled the lifeline of Bulgarian industry.

In the past ten years, Bulgaria has completely changed its face. At the end of 1947, banks, mines, large urban estates, and large enterprises were nationalized. Bulgarian industry developed at such a rate that by the end of 1952—when the first five-year plan was completed—industrial production accounted for 66.6 percent of the country's total production, while agricultural output accounted for 33.4 percent. These facts show that Bulgaria's economy has changed and is changing at a rapid pace, and the wealth of the Bulgarian people has increased.

Bulgaria has a myth: Krale Marko wears boots twenty-one miles long, with one foot on the longest Balkan Mountains in Bulgaria, and the other foot on the highest Rila peak. Bulgaria's economy, industry, and art have advanced at such a pace in the past decade.

In the past, Bulgaria had no heavy industry, and its power resources were only partially developed. Foreign capitalists were willing to invest their capital in light industry, insurance, and banking, which could generate profits quickly. Heavy industry was neglected and therefore not developed. It was in the interests of foreign capitalists for Bulgaria to remain in a state of agricultural stagnation forever. It became a market for foreign goods and lost its economic independence. Thus, it became a political appendage. Especially during World War II, the German "Farben" chemical industry company destroyed Bulgaria's valuable rose crops in order to ensure the sales of artificial perfumes produced by the German chemical industry. They also prohibited the production of valuable, fragrant Bulgarian tobacco in order to facilitate the development of the large-leaf "Virginia" tobacco needed for the German chemical industry.

After September 9, 1944, new and particularly important industries developed. These industries either did not exist at all in the past or were in their infancy. Machine manufacturing, electrical machinery manufacturing, shipbuilding, mining, fiber industry, non-ferrous and ferrous metal industry, chemical industry, and parts manufacturing have all developed. Huge oil wells have also been discovered. All these are unprecedented in Bulgaria and have been established and developed in the past decade. By the end of 1953, industrial production per capita had increased as follows compared to 1939: power—five times, coal—more than three times, cement—about three times, cotton fabrics—about three times, wool fabrics—twice, sugar—about three times, cheese—more than twice, soap—twice, and so on. From 1949 to 1952, more than seven hundred newly built or reconstructed industrial enterprises were put into operation.

The industrial development of Bulgaria has received selfless help from the Soviet people. Through long-term and short-term agreements, Bulgaria has received factories equipped with modern machinery and equipment from the Soviet Union. Thanks to the help of the Soviet Union, huge socialist industries have been established in Bulgaria—metallurgical and chemical plants, power stations, dams, and textile mills.

For the Bulgarian people, the great Soviet Union is the "elder brother." In Bulgaria, the word "Soviet" is also the most affectionate. Thanks to Russian assistance, the Bulgarian people gained their first national liberation from Turkish oppression in 1878. It was the Soviet people who helped us gain our second liberation from fascist and imperialist enslavement. Thanks to the Soviet Union, the Bulgarian people have achieved development and progress. The Bulgarian people will never forget the support of the Soviet people and have established an unbreakable and consolidated friendship with them.

Bulgarian agriculture has also made great progress. In the past, agriculture was primitive, and technology was poor. There were very few tractors in the country. The land was usually cultivated with small farm tools that could only be cultivated shallowly on small plots. Today, the Bulgarian countryside has changed. Nearly 61 percent of the land has been collectivized. Bulgaria's poor and middle peasants have established about three thousand agricultural production cooperatives. More than 15,000 tractors are cultivating the vast lands of agricultural production cooperatives. This year, Bulgaria has produced its first batch of combine harvesters, and some crops this summer were harvested with domestically produced combine harvesters. Although collectivized agriculture is still in its infancy in our countryside, it has shown great superiority over capitalist agriculture and individual small farmers. In 1953, the total grain production increased by 17.4 percent compared to 1939, wheat production increased by 32.5 percent, rye increased by 27.6 percent, and barley increased by 37.1 percent. The main problem of our agriculture—the grain problem—has been solved forever. Industrial raw material crops, which were neglected in the past, have also developed greatly. In 1953, the total production value of major industrial raw material crops increased by about 60 percent compared to 1939, cotton production value increased by 335.5 percent, sugar beet—243 percent, and tobacco—30.5 percent.

The Bulgarian Communist Party and the People's Government have given the greatest care to the constant improvement of the material and cultural well-being of the people. The average real wage of industrial workers has increased by nearly 40 percent compared to 1939. The planned reduction of consumer goods prices is an important and reliable way to continuously improve the living standards of the people. So far, retail prices have been reduced four times in succession, saving the working people billions of leva.

In the past decade, social and cultural undertakings that are very important for improving the people's welfare have also developed greatly. All Bulgarian people enjoy free medical care. Primary education is also free. The number of ordinary day and night schools has increased to 6,798, with 1,023,000 students. There are now 23 normal schools in the country, with a total of 10,568 students; 6,020 kindergartens, accommodating 300,000 children. There is no residential area in Bulgaria without a school. Illiteracy has been almost completely eliminated. In the past, there was one newspaper for every twelve people on average, but now every three or four people can see a newspaper.

At the end of 1953, 2,656 of the 5,000 Bulgarian villages had access to electricity, while before September 9, 1944, only 784 villages could use electricity. In 1954, 1,194 villages established broadcasting stations, and 214,543 public places and homes installed loudspeakers. We have more than 1,200 cinemas, of which about 700 are in rural areas. Before September 9, 1944, there were only 73 cinemas in rural areas, and only 213 in the whole country.

As this decade comes to a close, the Bulgarian people are striving to complete the second five-year plan. During the second five-year plan, the country's power output will double, pig iron production will increase fifteen times, rolled steel—ten times, lead—five and a half times. By 1957—the last year of the five-year plan, the output of the food industry will increase by about 50 percent, and special emphasis will be placed on increasing the variety and quality of food industry products.

The second five-year plan stipulates that the main task of agriculture is to ensure high and stable yields of crops, increase the number of livestock, and improve their fertility. The plan also provides for the further mechanization of agriculture to reduce the heavy labor of farmers.

The second five-year plan places special emphasis on significantly improving the material and cultural living standards of the working people.

Inspired by the achievements of the past ten years of free life, the Bulgarian people are realizing the second five-year plan with great enthusiasm. More than 80 percent of the working people have participated in the socialist labor competition. This is the most vivid proof of the soaring creativity of the working people in both urban and rural areas of People's Democratic Bulgaria. Workers in industry, transportation, and trade, laboring peasants in agricultural production cooperatives, and workers in machine tractor stations and state farms have all been swept up in the tide of competition.

After ten years, People's Democratic Bulgaria has emerged as a socialist country. The foundation of socialism has been laid in Bulgaria. Today, the Bulgarian people are building the edifice of a socialist society. Bulgaria has grown and continues to develop into a free and democratic country, a country loyal to the cause of democracy, socialism, and peace. In the past, Bulgaria was isolated and was a target of plunder by imperialist powers. During World War I, Bulgaria was occupied by Prussian troops, and during World War II, it was occupied by Nazi invaders. The Bulgarian bourgeoisie, as agents of foreign imperialism, turned Bulgaria into a hunting ground for German imperialists. Today, the people's democratic system has placed Bulgaria in the family of peace-loving democratic countries. This is another great achievement that the Bulgarian people have gained in the past decade. For the first time in its entire historical process, Bulgaria has received the great and noble friendship and support of the great Soviet Union, the great People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries of Europe and Asia, as well as all peace-loving people in the world. Bulgaria occupies an important strategic position in Eastern Europe—close to the Dardanelles Strait, which divides Europe and Asia. People's Democratic Bulgaria vigilantly guards this post.

The past decade has proved the correctness of the path pointed out and strictly followed by the immortal leader and mentor of the Bulgarian people—Dimitrov. With the help of the Soviet Union, the Bulgarian people have overcome all difficulties and achieved great victories, and they are now advancing to socialism and happiness with full confidence.

    伟大的十年
    保加利亚“祖国阵线报”总编辑  弗·托平查罗夫
    今年九月九日，是保加利亚从法西斯压迫和帝国主义奴役下获得解放的十周年。
    位于欧亚两洲交界地带的保加利亚，有着一千年充满了重要事件的历史。一九四四年九月九日，对于保加利亚人民来说，就像一九四九年十月一日对于中国人民那样，是一个最伟大的日子。这一天是划分阶级压迫的社会和没有人剥削人现象的社会的分界线。
    十年前的这一天，保加利亚共产党所领导的保加利亚人民反法西斯武装起义获得了胜利。资产阶级和保皇法西斯分子的政权被剥夺并转到了绝大多数人民——工人和劳动农民的手里。这个保加利亚历史上最伟大的胜利，是由于苏联的决定性的援助，由于苏联在巴尔干半岛上的胜利进军，歼灭了当时占领着保加利亚的纳粹军队而获得的。
    九月九日胜利以后，曾是统治阶级镇压和掠夺人民大众的工具的保加利亚政权，变成了人民所掌握的扫除资本主义及其剥削，建设社会主义与保证保加利亚人民幸福的工具了。所有的民主与爱国力量都团结在祖国阵线的旗帜下，团结在保加利亚共产党的领导下。一九四四年到一九五四年这十年间，充满着改变了保加利亚的国土和人民生活面貌的社会、经济、政治和文化的大事。回顾这些变化，我们可以把这一段时间称之为“伟大的十年”。十年来的引路人——保加利亚共产党的领袖季米特洛夫同志曾经指出过必须“通过工业化和电气化，并通过农业机械化，在十五年至二十年内，完成其他国家在不同条件下经一百年期间所完成的事业”。这就是人民民主的保加利亚十年来走过并已获得成就的道路。
    只是十年，保加利亚已大大地改变了。十年以前，它是一个农业国——农业在国家全部生产中占百分之六十六点二，而工业则只占百分之三十三点八。这说明保加利亚过去是一个农业落后、工业不发达的国家。保加利亚的可耕地总共有一千万英亩，分散为一千二百万个小块，农业产量很低。轻工业（制糖、罐头和纺织业）在工业中占着主要地位，技术是原始落后的。由于这些原因，保加利亚过去完全依赖外国企业。德国、法国、英国和美国资本掌握了保加利亚工业的命脉。
    十年来保加利亚已完全改变了它的面貌。一九四七年底，银行、矿山和城市大地产、大企业都成为国有的了。保加利亚的工业以这样的速度发展着：到一九五二年底——第一个五年计划完成时，工业生产已占全国生产的百分之六十六点六，而农业产量占百分之三十三点四了。这些事实表明：保加利亚的经济已经改变了，而且是以飞跃的速度在改变着，保加利亚人民的财富增加了。
    保加利亚有这样一个神话：克拉利·马尔科穿着一双二十一英里长的靴子，他的一只脚踏在保加利亚山脉中最长的巴尔干山上，而另一只脚又到了最高的里拉山峰。保加利亚的经济、工业和艺术在过去十年内就是以这样的步伐向前迈进的。
    过去，保加利亚没有重工业，动力资源也只有部分地开发。外国资本家愿意把他们的资本投入能够很快得到利润的轻工业、保险业和银行业。重工业是被忽视的，因而得不到发展。保加利亚永远停滞于农业国家的状况是正符合外国资本家的利益的。它成了外国商品的市场，丧失了经济上的独立性。这样，它就成了政治上的附庸。尤其是在第二次世界大战期间，德国“法本”化学工业公司为了保证德国化学工业出产的人造香水的销路，竟毁掉了保加利亚名贵的玫瑰作物。为了便于发展德国化学工业所需要的大叶子的“维琴尼亚”烟草，他们又禁止贵重的香味芬芳的保加利亚烟草的生产。
    一九四四年九月九日以后，新的特别重要的工业发展起来了。这些工业是过去根本没有的，或者是处在草创阶段的。机器制造业、电机制造业、造船业、采矿业、纤维工业、有色和黑色金属工业、化学工业和零件制造业等都已发展了。巨大的油井也被发现了。这些，都是保加利亚前所未有而在过去十年内创立和发展起来的。工业生产量按人口平均计算到一九五三年底比一九三九年有了如下增加：动力——五倍，煤——三倍多，水泥——约三倍，棉织品——约三倍，毛织品——二倍，糖——约三倍，干酪——二倍多，肥皂——二倍，等等。从一九四九年到一九五二年期间，共有七百多个新建或重建的工业企业开了工。
    保加利亚的工业发展得到了苏联人民的无私帮助。通过长期与短期的协定，保加利亚从苏联得到了用现代机器和设备装备着的工厂。由于苏联的帮助，在保加利亚建立了巨大的社会主义的工业——冶金和化学工厂、动力站、水闸和纺织厂。
    对于保加利亚人民来说，伟大的苏联是“老大哥”。在保加利亚，“苏联”这两个字也是最亲切的。感谢俄罗斯人的援助，保加利亚人民在一八七八年从土耳其压迫下获得了第一次民族解放。又是苏联人民帮助我们从法西斯和帝国主义的奴役下得了第二次解放。感谢苏联使保加利亚人民得到了发展和进步。保加利亚人民永远不忘苏联人民的支援，并和他们建立了牢不可破的巩固的友谊。
    保加利亚的农业也有了巨大的进展。过去，农业是原始的，技术是低劣的。全国只有很少几部拖拉机。土地通常是用只能在小块地上耕得很浅的小农具来耕作的。今天保加利亚的农村已经改观了。有将近百分之六十一的土地已实行了合作化。保加利亚的贫农和中农已成立了约三千个农业生产合作社。一万五千多架拖拉机在耕种着农业生产合作社的广阔的土地。今年保加利亚已生产了第一批收割联合机，今年夏天有一部分庄稼就是用国产的收割联合机收割的。虽然合作化的农业在我国农村中还处于初创阶段，但它已显示了较资本主义农业和个体小农有极大的优越性。一九五三年，谷物总生产量比一九三九年增加了百分之十七点四，小麦产量增加了百分之三十二点五，黑麦增加了百分之二十七点六，大麦增加了百分之三十七点一。我国农业的主要问题——谷物问题，从此永远地解决了。从前被忽略的工业原料作物现在也有了很大的发展。一九五三年主要工业原料作物的总生产值，比一九三九年增加了约百分之六十，棉花产值增加百分之三百三十五点五，甜菜—百分之二百四十三，烟草—百分之三十点五。
    保加利亚共产党和人民政府对人民的物质和文化福利的经常改善给予了最大的关怀。产业工人的平均实际工资比一九三九年增加将近百分之四十。消费品价格的有计划的减低，是不断提高人民生活水平的重要的和可靠的办法。到目前为止，零售价格已经连续减低了四次，使劳动人民节省了数十亿利瓦。
    在过去十年内，对于增进人民福利十分重要的社会和文化事业也有了很大的发展。全体保加利亚人民都享有免费的医疗。初等教育也是免费的。普通教育的日校和夜校数目已增加到六千七百九十八所，学生达一百零二万三千人。现在全国共有二十三所师范学校，学生共一万零五百六十八人；幼儿园六千零二十个，容纳三十万名儿童。在保加利亚已没有一个居民点是没有学校的。文盲几乎已全部肃清了。过去全国平均每十二个人有一份报纸，而现在每三、四个人就可看到一份报纸。
    在一九五三年底，五千个保加利亚乡村中，已有二千六百五十六个得到了电力的供应，而在一九四四年九月九日以前，只有七百八十四个村庄能以利用电力。一九五四年，一千一百九十四个村子建立了广播站，二十一万四千五百四十三个公共场所和家庭装设了播音器。我们已有一千二百多所电影院，其中约有七百所是在农村里。而在一九四四年九月以前，农村只有七十三个电影院，全国总共也不过二百一十三所。
    在这十年将结束的时候，保加利亚全国人民正在为完成第二个五年计划而奋斗着。在第二个五年计划期间，全国的动力产量将增加一倍，生铁产量增加十五倍，辗钢——十倍，铅——五倍半。到一九五七年——五年计划的最后一年，食品工业的产量将增加约百分之五十，并将特别着重于增加食品工业的品种和质量的提高。
    第二个五年计划规定农业的主要任务，是保证农作物的高额和稳定的收获量，增加牲畜的数量并提高其生殖率。计划并规定了农业的进一步机械化，以减轻农民的繁重劳动。
    第二个五年计划特别着重于显著地提高劳动人民的物质和文化生活水平。
    保加利亚全国人民，为过去十年自由生活的成就鼓舞着，正以极大的热情来实现第二个五年计划。百分之八十以上的劳动人民参加了社会主义劳动竞赛。这是人民民主的保加利亚城乡劳动人民创造力高涨的最生动的证明。工业、运输业和贸易部门的工人、农业生产合作社的劳动农民，以及机器拖拉机站与国营农场的工人们都卷入了竞赛的热潮。
    经过了十年，人民民主的保加利亚已经以社会主义国家的姿态出现了。社会主义的基础已在保加利亚奠定了。今天，保加利亚人民正在建设着社会主义社会的大厦。保加利亚已长成并继续发展为一个自由的民主国家，一个忠于民主、社会主义与和平事业的国家。在从前，保加利亚是孤立的，是帝国主义列强的掠夺对象。第一次世界大战期间保加利亚被普鲁士军队占领过，在第二次世界大战内又被纳粹侵略者占领。作为外国帝国主义代理人的保加利亚资产阶级，使保加利亚变成了德国帝国主义者的游猎场所。今天，人民民主制度使保加利亚站在爱好和平的民主国家的大家庭里了。这是保加利亚人民在过去十年内所获得的另一个伟大成果。在全部历史进程中，保加利亚第一次得到伟大的苏联、伟大的中华人民共和国和欧亚各人民民主国家以及全世界所有爱好和平的人民的伟大崇高的友谊和支持。保加利亚处在东欧一个重要的战略地位——靠近划分着欧洲与亚洲的达达尼尔海峡。人民民主的保加利亚警惕地坚守着这个岗位。
    过去的十年证明了保加利亚人民不朽的领袖和导师——季米特洛夫所指出的并被严格遵循着的道路的正确性。在苏联的帮助之下，保加利亚人民克服了一切困难，取得了伟大的胜利，他们今天正满怀信心地向社会主义、向幸福前进。
