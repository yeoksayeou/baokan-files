Personal Experience
Sun Ding, First Deputy Director of the Shanghai Xin'an Electric Motor Factory (Joint State-Private)

    Shanghai's private electrical equipment industry is gradually embarking on the path of state capitalism and is progressively developing towards the advanced form of state capitalism—joint state-private ownership. Currently, five private factories have implemented joint state-private ownership, with Xin'an Electric Motor Factory being one of them.
    I am the founder of the original private Xin'an Electric Motor Factory. After the joint venture, I served as the private representative and also held the position of First Deputy Director. Throughout the entire process of the factory's tremendous changes, I gained profound insights through my personal experience.
    In the short six months since the joint venture began in February this year, significant changes have taken place in all aspects of the factory. For example, important measures such as reducing working hours, improving quality, and shortening production cycles, which were previously considered impossible, have now been realized one by one after the joint venture. Late deliveries, a common occurrence before the joint venture, have now been eliminated, except for a few special cases. The chaotic supply of raw materials, which often led to work stoppages, has also been gradually overcome due to the adjustment of supply mechanisms and the establishment of new systems. Financial budgets, which could never be implemented before the joint venture, are now conscientiously executed by all departments, improving the financial situation. These numerous facts have given me an important revelation: On the one hand, these achievements are, of course, determined by the brilliance of the national policy and the leading role of the socialist elements in the enterprise. At the same time, it is inseparable from the private representatives accepting leadership and accepting transformation. On the other hand—what I have experienced most profoundly is the great power of the working class. Only when the relations of production adapt to the productive forces can they be continuously and fully发挥出来 (fāhuī chūlái - brought into full play). It is unimaginable to examine the changes achieved by Xin'an Electric Motor Factory since the joint venture without considering the efforts of all employees.
    In such a great social and economic transformation, I feel that our bourgeoisie's original ideological understanding, management style, and leadership methods are far from the requirements of the changed nature of the enterprise. Only by studying diligently, sincerely accepting the leadership of socialist elements, and actively accepting socialist transformation can we further transform ourselves and contribute to the country's construction cause. At the beginning of the joint venture, my understanding of this issue was not concrete enough, not profound enough, and not comprehensive enough. For example, the labor cost per piece at Xin'an Electric Motor Factory was very high, exceeding the reasonable figures stipulated by the government. After the joint venture, I only hoped to compensate for it by adjusting the labor cost per piece or adjusting the working hours. However, the public representative pointed out that we should start by reducing working hours, reducing waste, and reducing costs to solve the labor cost per piece problem. This difference in starting points deeply demarcated a divide between socialist management policies and capitalist management policies. The public representative based his handling of problems on the interests and policies of the country, while the private representative's starting point could not escape the small circle of the enterprise unit or even the interests of the private sector. This made me further appreciate the profound significance of accepting the leadership of socialist elements, and recognize that establishing a normal relationship between leadership and being led in joint state-private enterprises is a basic guarantee for realizing socialist transformation. And it made me think of some private industrialists and businessmen or private representatives who verbally admit to accepting socialist leadership, but when they encounter the specific issue of the private sector accepting the leadership of the public sector, they cannot understand it. They do not understand that the public representative is the representative of the country and socialist ideology to lead the private representative and transform the capitalists.
    Under the leadership of the public sector, private representatives must fulfill their responsibilities in administrative positions. For example, there are three factory directors in our factory, two of whom are public representatives. The three factory directors have adopted a collective office system, and there is a clear division of labor for the business leadership of each department. For example, I am responsible for technology and supply and marketing work. According to the joint decisions and principles of the three factory directors, I have full authority to handle the work within my area of responsibility, with duties and powers, abiding by my duties and fulfilling my responsibilities. Every one or two days, the three factory directors hold a meeting to report to each other, and if there are important issues, they study and solve them together. At the factory director meetings, I always fully express my opinions. When my opinions are inconsistent with those of the public factory directors, my ideological understanding is improved through the sincere exchange of views between the two parties. In this way, through one practical task after another, I accepted the leadership of the public representatives bit by bit, and at the same time, I also carried out ideological transformation bit by bit, initially.

    切身的体会
    公私合营上海新安电机厂第一副厂长　孙鼎
    上海的私营电工器材工业，正在逐步走上国家资本主义的道路，并且正在逐步向国家资本主义的高级形式——公私合营发展，目前已有五个私营厂实行公私合营，新安电机厂即是其中的一个。
    我是原私营新安电机厂的创办人，合营后，是私方代表，兼任第一副厂长的职务，在这个厂的巨大变化的全部过程中，我以亲身的经历，获得深切的体会。
    今年二月合营以来的短短半年中，厂内一切情况都有了显著的改变，例如：关于减少工时、提高质量、缩短生产周期等等重要措施，在合营前是被认为不可能实现的，而在合营后，都一一实现了；合营前的交货误期，是经常的现象，而今天，除个别特殊情况外，误期现象已被消灭；合营前原料供应混乱，经常停工待料，现在也由于调整了供应机构，订出了新制度而逐步克服了停工待料现象；合营前的财务预算，始终无法执行，而今天各部门都能自觉地执行财务计划，改善了财务情况。这许许多多事实给了我一个重要的启示：一方面，这些成绩，当然决定于国家政策的英明，和企业中社会主义成分领导作用的发挥。同时也和私方代表接受领导、接受改造分不开的；另一方面——使我体会最深刻的，就是工人阶级的伟大力量，只有在生产关系适应生产力之后，才能不断地充分地发挥出来，离开了全体职工的努力来考察新安电机厂合营以来所获得的变化，是不可想像的。
    在这样一个伟大的社会经济改造中，使我感到我们资产阶级原有的思想认识，经营作风和领导方法等，和企业性质改变后的要求相差太远了。我们只有努力学习，诚心诚意来接受社会主义成分的领导，积极地接受社会主义改造，才有可能进一步改造自己，才有可能对国家的建设事业有所贡献。合营初期，我对这个问题的认识是不够具体、不够深刻、不够全面的。举个例子来说：新安电机厂的工缴是很高的，超过政府规定的合理数字，合营之后，我只希望从调整工缴或者调整工时的办法来弥补，但公方代表指出应当从降低工时、减少浪费、降低成本等措施来着手解决工缴问题，这两个出发点的一念之差，就深深地划出了社会主义经营方针和资本主义经营方针的一道鸿沟，公方代表处理问题时，是以国家的利益和政策为依据的；而私方代表处理问题时，出发点跳不出本企业单位甚至私方利益的小圈子的，这使我进一步体会到接受社会主义成分领导的深刻意义，认识到公私合营厂中建立领导与被领导的正常关系是实现社会主义改造的基本保证。并且使我联想到有些私营工商界或私方代表口头上承认接受社会主义领导，但一碰到私方接受公方领导这个具体问题时，他又想不通了，他不懂得公方代表就是代表国家和社会主义思想来领导私方代表和改造资本家的。
      在公方领导下，私方代表在行政职务上要尽到自己的责任。就像我们厂里共有三位厂长，其中两位是公方代表。三位厂长采取了集体办公制，对于各科室的业务领导都有明确的分工，例如我是负责技术和供销工作的，按照三位厂长共同的决定和原则，我就全权处理我的责任范围内的工作，有职有权，守职尽责。每隔一、二天，三位厂长要开一次碰头会，相互汇报，遇有重要问题，共同研究解决。我在厂长碰头会上总是充分发表我的意见，遇到我和公方厂长的意见不一致时，经过双方的推诚相见，使我的思想认识有所提高，就这样，通过一件一件的实际工作，我点点滴滴地接受了公方代表的领导，同时也是点点滴滴地、初步地进行了思想改造。
