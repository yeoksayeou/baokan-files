The broad masses of peasants in Shanxi Province are actively demanding to join agricultural cooperatives. Up to now, according to incomplete statistics, more than 50,000 mutual aid teams, including more than 568,000 farm households, have signed up to join or transfer to cooperatives.

The Party and government leading organs in various regions have strengthened their leadership over the preparations for the development of agricultural cooperatives early on. Through forms such as "mutual aid and cooperation networks," they have closely linked agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid teams, creating ample favorable conditions for the large-scale development of agricultural cooperatives after the autumn harvest. Under the impetus of 131 agricultural cooperatives in Xiyang County, the number of farm households participating in mutual aid and cooperation reached 93.3% of the total number of farm households in the county. Now, more than 11,500 households are actively requesting to join cooperatives. All of the more than 1,400 mutual aid teams in Tunliu County have established contact with agricultural cooperatives, of which 918 teams have expressed their desire to join cooperatives. More than 1,000 mutual aid teams in Lingchuan County are actively requesting to join cooperatives, of which 356 mutual aid teams have signed cooperative joining contracts with 241 agricultural cooperatives. Many mutual aid teams that want to join the cooperatives have already partnered with the agricultural cooperatives to accumulate fertilizer and jointly carry out basic farmland construction. According to incomplete statistics from Lingchuan County, a total of 101 mutual aid teams and 59 agricultural cooperatives have jointly reclaimed wasteland and built beaches, planting a total of 728 mu of late autumn crops and oil crops. Because these mutual aid teams have been directly assisted by the cooperatives and their production is better than in previous years, their enthusiasm for joining cooperatives has become even stronger. Through the connection between cooperatives and teams, many mutual aid teams are actively cultivating cooperative management personnel and accumulating public property. According to statistics from Wuxiang and Xiyang counties, 471 new agricultural cooperatives are planned to be built after the autumn harvest this year, of which 380 cooperative directors have been trained and the accountants for 324 cooperatives have been prepared. According to statistics from the three special districts of Changzhi, Xin County, and Linfen, nearly 3,000 new cooperatives have determined the number of households joining, and selected management personnel. Some of these cooperatives have already begun joint production.

    山西省五万多个互助组准备入社或转社
    山西省广大农民群众积极要求参加农业社，到目前为止，据不完全统计：报名入社或转社的互助组，即有五万余个，包括五十六万八千余农户。
    各地党政领导机关对发展农业社的准备工作及早加强了领导，通过“互助合作网”等形式，密切了农业社和互助组的联系，给秋后农业社大发展创造了充分的有利条件。昔阳在全县一百三十一个农业社的带动下，参加互助合作的农户占到全县农户总数的百分之九十三点三，现在已有一万一千五百余户积极要求入社。屯留全县一千四百余个互助组均与农业社有了联系，其中即有九百一十八个组提出了要求入社。陵川全县共一千余个互助组积极要求入社，其中即有三百五十六个互助组与二百四十一个农业社订立了入社合同。有不少要求入社的互助组已经和农业社合伙进行积肥，并共同进行土地基本建设。据陵川县的不完全统计：共有一百零一个互助组与五十九个农业社合伙开荒、修滩地已播种晚秋作物和油料等共七百二十八亩。这些互助组由于在社的直接帮助下，比往年的生产搞得好，因而他们的入社情绪更坚定了。通过社、组联系，不少互助组积极地培养办社骨干和积累公共财产。据武乡、昔阳两个县的统计：今年秋后计划新建农业社四百七十一个，其中即有三百八十个社的社长已培养成熟，三百二十四个社的会计已准备好人材。据长治、忻县、临汾等三个专区的统计：目前已有近三千个新社确定了入社户数，选拔好办社骨干，其中有部分社已开始进行合伙生产。
