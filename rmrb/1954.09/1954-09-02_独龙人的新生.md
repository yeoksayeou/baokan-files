    How many years ago, to escape the oppression of other ethnic groups, the Dulong people migrated to the Dulong River Valley between the Gaoligong Mountains and the Dian Danglika Mountains. All year round, they endured hunger and cold, wore only a piece of hemp cloth, ate mostly grass roots and bark, while the Kuomintang's reactionary rulers' exorbitant taxes and levies continued to come one after another. During the Kuomintang rule, there were at least three apportionments every year, and they also had to pay local products such as furs and Rhizoma Coptidis. In the last hundred years, their population has continued to decline, and now there are only 272 households, with 2,311 people.
    In 1950, Gongshan County was liberated. The Dulong people began to embark on a new life. The Dulong people have their own ethnic language. In the past, they were discriminated against and insultingly called "Qiu people." Now, according to their wishes, they are called Dulong. The People's Government first abolished all burdens, and then launched relief efforts to help them develop production. In the past three years, the Dulong people have received more than 200 million yuan in relief funds, more than 20,000 kilograms of relief rice, 1,000 pieces of relief cloth and more than 400 sets of clothing, as well as a large number of iron farm tools and seeds. With the specific help of the ethnic production work team of the Gongshan County Committee of the Communist Party of China, agricultural and sideline production has developed. The Dulong people, who only used a long knife for slash-and-burn cultivation, have now learned to use hoes and plows. Land that had never been plowed before is now being cultivated with iron farm tools. More than 400 mu of paddy fields and cultivated land have begun to appear along the Dulong River. This year, the Gongshan County Lisu Autonomous Region People's Government organized more than 30 Han and Lisu farmers to help them plow the land, transplant rice seedlings, and teach them farming techniques. The newly planted corn and rice have now matured and are heading, and a bumper harvest is coming soon. It is estimated that this year's grain output will be more than doubled compared with the early days of liberation.
    The People's Government has also set up trade teams, opened primary schools, and established health centers here. The Dulong people can now sell Rhizoma Coptidis and Fritillaria locally, and buy salt and cloth; children have begun to have the opportunity to receive education; and the Dulong people can also receive treatment when they are sick.
    Here, the Dulong people are beginning to look forward to a bright and happy future. In October last year, with the help of the People's Government, they established their own autonomous government. In August this year, the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Region held its first people's representative conference of all ethnic groups, and the Dulong people sent ten representatives who traveled for fourteen days to participate. Bu Nan, who was elected as a member of the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Region People's Government, said at the meeting: "In the past, we were afraid of the Han people, the Tibetan people, and the Lisu people. Now we are like brothers and sisters. We, a small ethnic group living in the deep mountains, have also obtained equal rights. We all believe that we will go to socialist society together with all ethnic groups."

    独龙人的新生
    新华社记者  松青、朝阳
    不知在多少年前，独龙人为了逃避其他民族的压迫，就迁移到高黎贡山和颠当力卡山之间的毒龙河谷里。他们终年忍受着饥寒，穿的是一片麻布，吃的大半是草根树皮，而反动统治者的苛捐杂税，却仍然接踵而来。在国民党统治时期，每年至少有三次摊派，还要缴纳皮毛、黄连等土产。在最近一百年中，他们的人口不断减少，到现在只有二百七十二户，二千三百一十一个人。
    一九五零年，贡山县解放了。独龙人开始走上了新生的道路。独龙人有他们自己民族的语言。以前，他们受歧视，被侮称为“俅人”，现在按他们的意愿改称独龙。人民政府首先取消了一切负担，随即展开救济，扶助他们发展生产。三年多来，独龙人得到救济款二亿多元，救济米二万多斤，救济布一千件和衣服四百多套，还得到大量的铁质农具和籽种。在中共贡山县委员会民族生产工作队的具体帮助下，农、副业生产发展了。从来只有一把长刀进行刀耕火种的独龙人，现在已学会使用锄头、犁头了。一向没有翻耕过的土地，现在已经用铁制的农具进行耕种了；在毒龙河边，开始出现了四百多亩水田和熟地。今年，贡山县傈僳族自治区人民政府组织了三十多个汉族、傈僳族农民去帮助他们犁地、插秧，教他们耕作的技术。新种植的玉米、水稻现在已结实抽穗，即将丰收，估计今年的粮食，可比解放初期增产一倍以上。
    人民政府还在这里设立了贸易小组，开办了小学校，成立了卫生所。独龙人开始能在本地出售黄连、贝母，买到了食盐、布匹；孩子们开始有了受教育的机会；独龙人有了病还得到了治疗。
    在这里，独龙人开始憧憬着光明幸福的远景。去年十月，他们在人民政府帮助下，建立了自己的自治政权。今年八月，怒江傈僳族自治区举行首次各族各界人民代表会议，独龙人派了十个代表，赶了十四天路程来参加。当选为怒江傈僳族自治区人民政府委员的布喃，在会议上发言说：“过去，我们怕汉族、怕藏族、也怕傈僳族，现在我们都像兄弟姊妹一样了。我们住在深山里的小民族，也得到了平等权利。我们都相信，我们会同各族人民一路走到社会主义社会。”
