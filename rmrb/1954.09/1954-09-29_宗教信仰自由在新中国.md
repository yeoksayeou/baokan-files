    Religious Freedom in New China
    Xirao Jiacuo (Tibetan), Representative of the National People's Congress and Acting President of the Buddhist Association of China
    The reactionary ruling class of the Kuomintang also talked about religious freedom in the past, but many facts of religious persecution exposed their hypocrisy. For example, Ma Bufang and his son, the executioners who consistently slaughtered lamas, sent troops to Qinghai to loot the "Zangguanba Temple," "Zhujie Temple," "Sailao Temple," and "Labrang Monastery," etc., using the solemn banner poles of Zhujie Temple as crosses for hanging lamas' heads. "Gongtang Luozhe," a famous Buddhist scholar from Labrang Monastery, was also brutally murdered. Their cruelty knew no bounds. The fate of Buddhism was like this, and the experiences of other religions were equally tragic.
    The reactionary ruling class put on a hypocritical facade, talking extravagantly about freedom of religious belief, entirely to co-opt upper-level religious figures and deceive the broad masses of religious believers, using religion as one of their tools for ruling the broad masses of people, thereby consolidating their reactionary rule. They even more viciously used differences in religious beliefs and sectarian differences within the same religion to sow discord and create divisions, forming historical mutual discrimination between religions, sects, and ethnic groups, bringing endless suffering to the people.
    In 1949, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese People's Revolution achieved a great victory and established a new China of the people. At that time, I was apprehensive because I had been influenced by the reactionary propaganda that the so-called "Communists do not want religion." Initially, I was quite doubtful when I heard that the Communist Party had put forward the policy of freedom of religious belief. In January 1950, when I participated in the work of the People's Government, I was still skeptical. Later, due to witnessing many ironclad facts of the Communist Party's adherence to the policy of freedom of religious belief, I gradually dispelled my doubts. These facts also resolved the doubts of the broad masses of religious believers, thereby further recognizing the authenticity of religious freedom in New China.
    In the five years since liberation, our religious believers have generally raised their political awareness and patriotic ideology, clearly distinguished between the enemy and ourselves, and on this basis, established the national Chinese Buddhist Association, the Chinese Islamic Association, and the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of the Chinese Christian Church, further uniting believers of all religions across the country. Taking the Buddhist Association of China as an example, it has widely united believers of various sects and factions from eight ethnic groups, including Han, Tibetan, Mongolian, Dai, Manchu, Miao, Yugu, and Tu, to make progress together. In the year or so since the establishment of the Buddhist Association, Buddhists in various regions, under its guidance, have strengthened their study, further enhanced their patriotic ideology, and made certain achievements in defending world peace and assisting the People's Government in implementing the policy of freedom of religious belief.
    We religious believers deeply appreciate the protection measures taken by the People's Government for religion in accordance with the policy of freedom of religious belief. Taking Buddhism as an example, the grand Yonghe Lamasery in the capital had been in disrepair for generations, and the halls and buildings were dilapidated. After liberation, excellent craftsmen from various regions were employed to carefully repair it, and the Yonghe Palace was restored to its appearance with painted beams and carved rafters, brightly colored paint, red walls and yellow tiles, and golden splendor. Mount Wutai, one of the four famous mountains known throughout the country, a sacred place worshiped by Mongolian, Tibetan and other minority ethnic groups, was destroyed by war during the enemy and puppet period, and thousands of years of accumulated Buddhist architecture were reduced to ashes. It has been repaired after liberation, allowing the sacred site to shine again after the disaster. Other famous temples in Hangzhou, such as Lingyin Temple, and many famous temples in various provinces have also been repaired. For example, the Grand Golden Tile Hall and the Xiazhong Temple in Qinghai's Ta'er Monastery, the birthplace of Huangjiao (Yellow Sect) founder Tsongkhapa, the hometown of the Dalai Lama, and the long-term residence of the Panchen Erdeni, have all been repaired and look brand new. My student, Gesang Wangdui, vice chairman of the People's Liberation Committee of Changdu area, presented me with a copy of the Degé edition of the Tanjur Tripitaka. Due to the limitations of manpower and material resources, I was unable to transport it. Fortunately, the People's Government provided great assistance and sent people from Yushu to Degé with camels and horses to transport the scriptures to Yushu, and then by car via Xining to Gu Lei Temple in Xunhua. When the Tibetan scriptures arrived at Gu Lei Temple, monks and laypeople worshiped along the road, sincerely thanking the Communist Party and the People's Government for protecting Buddhism.
    In the past few years, people's representative conferences at all levels in provinces, cities, and even some counties and cities across the country have had Buddhist representatives participating. In this general election, Buddhists across the country not only have the sacred right to vote, but also have Buddhist representatives elected in various places, which is even more prominent in minority ethnic areas. Taking Qinghai as an example, among the nine representatives attending the first session of the First National People's Congress, Xia Rongga Bu, Song Bu, and I are all monks, and Ma Xingtai and Guan Baojia are also devout religious believers. Religious believers have not only improved their domestic political status, but have also appeared in international activities. For example, at the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference held in Beijing in 1952, Master Yuan Ying, Layman Zhao Puchu, and I participated in the Chinese delegation. Master Neng Hai also attended the World Peace Congress held in Vienna in 1952. Many Buddhists have also become working cadres of the People's Government.
    The religious life of religious believers has not changed due to participation in the work of the People's Government; on the contrary, it has been respected and taken care of by the People's Government. For example, the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang has Buddhist halls in the autonomous organs, providing convenience for religious believers among cadres to recite scriptures. During various meetings, full attention is also paid to the religious life of religious believers. For example, during the Fourth (Enlarged) Meeting of the Central Nationalities Affairs Commission, in order to take care of the Muslim participants to celebrate the "Juma Festival" well, the morning meeting was suspended on that day. When Qinghai holds various meetings, in order to specifically take care of the Islamic teaching of five daily prayers, a special clean room is set up for people who believe in Islam to pray. What should be pointed out even more is that the Communist Party and the People's Government constantly educate the broad masses of people and cadres at all levels, and even the armed forces, to respect the religious beliefs of the people of all ethnic groups. What impressed me most was the respect of the Chinese People's Liberation Army for religion. Last year, when the People's Liberation Army suppressed the bandits Ma Liang and Ma Yuanxiang, who were wreaking havoc in southern Qinghai and southern Gansu, they still unswervingly observed the military discipline of respecting the religious beliefs of the people of all ethnic groups and did not live in temples, even though they were in a harsh environment on the vast grasslands where they could not eat for days. Compared with the past atrocities of Ma Bufang's bandits, who slaughtered lamas and destroyed temples, it makes people more deeply realize the loveliness of the People's Army and the hatred of the reactionary bandits.
    What we Buddhists cannot forget in particular is the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet reached three years ago under the leadership of the Central People's Government. Tibet is a place where Buddhism is prevalent, and the content of the agreement is full of respect and protection for Buddhism, which has been widely supported by the Tibetan people. The implementation of this agreement has enabled the Tibetan people to forever get rid of imperialist aggression and bondage, return to the friendly and cooperative family of all ethnic groups in the motherland, ended the long-term disunity between the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni caused by the instigation of reactionary rulers, and enabled the Panchen Erdeni, who had been unable to return to Tibet for decades, to return to Tibet smoothly. Now the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni, and the broad masses of the Tibetan people are closely united, and they are building the Tibet of the great motherland with full confidence. Recently, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni went together from the remote border to Beijing to represent all the people of Tibet to attend the first session of the First National People's Congress, which is unprecedented. When we welcomed the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni at the Qianmen Railway Station in Beijing, we couldn't help but think of the kindness of the great Chinese Communist Party and the great Chairman Mao. This historical event is something that we Buddhists can never forget.
    The facts of religious freedom in New China are now fixed in the Constitution, allowing religious believers to further experience the warmth of the motherland's big family. We must love the great motherland even more and form an unbreakable united front to defend the motherland's big family that truly maintains religious freedom. Everyone knows that the imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique are unwilling to die. After the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, who brought disaster to the country and the people, fled to Taiwan, under the patronage of American imperialism, he not only robbed our country and friendly countries' ships with shameless piracy, but also constantly sent bandit troops to harass our coastal areas and send special agents to sneak into the mainland to carry out sabotage activities, seriously threatening the safety of the motherland and also threatening the freedom of belief of religious believers. The traitor Chiang is the common enemy of the people of the motherland, including religious believers. The people of the whole country, regardless of whether they have religious beliefs or not, have the responsibility to defend the motherland. However, our religious circles themselves, due to insufficient vigilance in the past, gave the US-Chiang bandit gang an opportunity to exploit. In the future, we should redouble our vigilance, strictly guard against and smash the conspiracies and tricks of American imperialism and the Chiang bandit gang to use religion, and thoroughly eliminate religious traitors who are harmful to the country and religion, who are lurking within religion under the guise of religion, rectify our own ranks, and together with the people of the motherland, use practical actions to strive to implement the call to liberate Taiwan, thoroughly eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang that occupies Taiwan and threatens the safety of the motherland, and strive to ensure the interests of the people of the motherland and the happy life of religious believers' freedom of belief.

    宗教信仰自由在新中国
    全国人民代表大会代表 中国佛教协会代理会长  喜饶嘉错（藏族）
    宗教信仰自由这句话，过去国民党反动统治阶级也说过，但是许多摧残宗教的事实，揭穿了他们的伪善。例如一贯屠杀喇嘛的刽子手马匪步芳父子，在青海派兵洗劫了“藏官巴寺”、“竹节寺”、
  “赛老寺”、“拉卜楞寺”等，把竹节寺庄严的幡竿作为悬挂喇嘛人头的十字架，拉卜楞寺的佛教名学者“共堂罗者”也惨遭杀害。其残暴无以复加。佛教的命运如此，其他各宗教的遭遇，也是同样悲惨的。
    反动统治阶级装出一付伪善的面貌，侈谈信教自由，完全是为了笼络宗教界上层人士和欺骗广大信教群众，把宗教作为他们统治广大人民的御用工具之一，借以巩固其反动统治。他们更恶毒地利用宗教信仰的不同和同一宗教中的教派差别，进行挑拨离间，制造分裂，形成了历史上教与教、派与派，以及民族间、地区间的相互歧视，给人民带来了无穷的痛苦。
    一九四九年在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，中国人民革命取得了伟大胜利，建立了人民的新中国。当时我由于过去受了所谓“共产党不要宗教”的反动宣传的影响，惶惶不安。最初我听到共产党提出了宗教信仰自由政策，对此颇有疑惑。一九五○年元月，我参加人民政府工作的当时，仍是将信将疑。以后由于目睹共产党坚持执行宗教信仰自由政策的许多铁的事实，逐渐消除了疑虑。这些事实，也同样解决了广大宗教信仰者的疑虑，从而进一步认识了新中国宗教信仰自由的真实性。
    解放五年以来，我们宗教徒普遍提高了政治觉悟和爱国主义思想，划清了敌我界线，并在此基础上成立了全国性的中国佛教协会、中国伊斯兰教协会、中国基督教三自爱国运动委员会，进一步团结了全国各宗教的信仰者。拿中国佛教协会来说，它广泛地团结了全国汉、藏、蒙、傣、满、苗、裕固、土族等八个民族的各宗各派的信仰者共同进步。佛教协会成立一年多以来，各地佛教徒在它的指导下，加强学习，更加提高了爱国主义思想，在保卫世界和平、协助人民政府贯彻宗教信仰自由政策方面作出了一定的成绩。
    我们宗教徒，深切感激人民政府根据宗教信仰自由政策对宗教所采取的保护的措施。拿佛教来说，首都规模宏大的雍和宫喇嘛寺，历代失修，殿宇破旧不堪；解放后，经延致各地优良工匠精心培修，雍和宫又恢复了画栋雕梁、油彩鲜明、红墙黄瓦、金碧辉煌的面貌。全国知名的四大名山之一的、蒙藏等少数民族崇拜的圣地——五台山，敌伪时期，毁于兵燹，数千年积累下来的佛教建筑，尽付灰烬。解放后已经培修，使圣地劫后重光。其他如杭州灵隐寺和各省许多著名寺院，也都修建了。例如黄教祖师宗喀巴的诞生地、达赖喇嘛的家乡、班禅额尔德尼久经驻锡之地——青海塔尔寺的大金瓦殿和峡种寺，都经修理，焕然一新。我的学生昌都地区人民解放委员会副主席格桑旺堆赠我德格版丹珠尔大藏经一部，我因人力物力的限制，无力启运，幸得人民政府大力帮助，由玉树派人赶着驼马去德格把经运抵玉树，再由汽车经西宁运抵循化古雷寺。当藏经运抵古雷寺时，僧俗群众，夹道膜拜，衷心感谢共产党和人民政府对佛教的保护。
    几年以来，全国各省市乃至部分县市的各界人民代表会议，都有佛教徒参加。这次普选，全国佛教徒不仅有神圣的选举权，而且各地都有佛教徒当选代表，在少数民族地区更为显著。以青海而论，出席第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的九位代表中，我和夏葺尕布、松布，都是出家喇嘛，还有马兴泰，官保加二位代表，都是虔诚的宗教信仰者。宗教徒不仅在国内政治地位提高了，并出现在国际活动中，如一九五二年在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，我和圆瑛法师及赵朴初居士都参加了中国代表团。能海法师并出席了一九五二年在维也纳召开的世界和平代表大会。佛教徒也有很多人成为人民政府的工作干部。
    宗教徒的宗教生活，并未因参加人民政府工作有所改变，相反的，还得到人民政府的尊重和照顾。例如西康藏族自治区，在自治机关中设有佛堂，给干部中的宗教信仰者以诵经的方便。在各种会议期间，也充分注意了宗教徒的宗教生活，如中央民族事务委员会第四次（扩大）会议开会期间，为了照顾参加会议的伊斯兰教徒过好“朱马节日”，在节日那天停止了午前的会议。青海在召开各种会议时，为了具体照顾伊斯兰教五时礼拜的教规，专辟净室，以便信仰伊斯兰教的人礼拜。更应当指出的是共产党和人民政府对广大人民和各级干部以至武装部队，经常进行尊重各民族人民宗教信仰的教育。最使我感动的是中国人民解放军对宗教的尊重。去年人民解放军进剿为祸青南、甘南的马良、马元祥股匪时，在辽阔的草原上虽处在栉风沐雨数日不得食的艰苦环境下，仍毫不动摇地遵守尊重各族人民宗教信仰的军纪，不住寺院。这与过去马匪步芳屠杀喇嘛，毁灭寺院的暴行相较，使人更深切体会到人民军队的可爱，益见反动匪军的可恨。
    我们佛教徒特别不能忘记的是：三年以前，在中央人民政府领导下所达成的关于和平解放西藏办法的协议。西藏是佛教盛行的地方，协议内容充满了对佛教的尊重和保护，得到西藏人民普遍的拥护。这个协议的执行，使西藏人民永远摆脱了帝国主义的侵略和羁绊，回到祖国各民族友爱合作的大家庭里来了，结束了由于反动统治者的挑拨所造成的达赖喇嘛同班禅额尔德尼长期不团结的历史，使几十年不能回西藏的班禅额尔德尼顺利地回到了西藏。现在达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼同全西藏广大人民都亲密地团结起来了，正信心百倍地建设着伟大祖国的西藏。最近达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼从遥远的边疆一同到北京代表全西藏人民出席第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，更是史无前例的。当我们在北京前门车站欢迎达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼的时候，情不自禁地想到伟大的中国共产党和伟大的毛主席的恩情。这个历史事件，是我们佛教徒永远不能忘记的。
    在新中国宗教信仰自由的事实，现在更在宪法中固定下来了，使宗教信仰者进一步体会到祖国大家庭的温暖。我们必须更好地热爱伟大的祖国，结成牢不可破的统一战线，以保卫真正维护宗教信仰自由的祖国大家庭。大家都知道：帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团是不甘心死亡的，祸国殃民的蒋贼介石逃到台湾后，在美国帝国主义豢养下，不仅以无耻的海盗行为劫夺我国和友邦的海船，并不断派出匪军骚扰我沿海地区和派遣特务潜入大陆进行破坏活动，严重地威胁着祖国的安全，也威胁着宗教徒的信仰自由。蒋贼是包括宗教徒在内的祖国人民的共同敌人，全国人民不分有无宗教信仰，都有保卫祖国的责任。但是，我们宗教界本身，过去由于警惕性不够，给美蒋匪帮钻空子的机会，今后应加倍提高警惕，严防并粉碎美国帝国主义和蒋匪帮利用宗教的阴谋诡计，并应彻底清除披着宗教外衣潜藏在宗教内部的害国害教的宗教叛徒，严整自己的阵容，与祖国人民一道，用实际行动，努力贯彻解放台湾的号召，彻底消灭霸占台湾威胁祖国安全的蒋介石匪帮，为确保祖国人民的利益和宗教徒信仰自由的幸福生活而奋斗。（附图片）
    九月九日下午，班禅额尔德尼到达赖喇嘛寓所看望达赖喇嘛。这是达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼正在会客室里谈论宪法草案。
