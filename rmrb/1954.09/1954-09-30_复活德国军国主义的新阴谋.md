    New Conspiracy to Revive German Militarism
    Tan Wenrui
    The nine-nation conference of Britain, the United States, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, West Germany, Italy, and Canada was held in London on September 28th. Western news agencies have made no secret of the fact that the actual purpose of this conference is to formulate a new plan to rearm West Germany to replace the failed "European Defense Community" plan.
    Since the French National Assembly rejected the "European Defense Community" treaty, Western countries have launched a frantic diplomatic effort to find new ways to rearm West Germany. Politicians on both sides of the Atlantic are openly discussing various new plans for rearming West Germany, as if the act of rearming West Germany is not a violation of the interests of the people of Europe, and the problem now is only to find a way to arm West Germany.
    The American ruling group has more than once threatened that if the "European Defense Community" treaty is rejected by France, the United States will restore West Germany's "sovereignty" and incorporate it into the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. The day after the French National Assembly rejected the "European Defense Community" treaty, Dulles threatened that the rearmament of West Germany was an "unchangeable" fact and suggested convening the North Atlantic Council to accept the American plan. Later, Dulles issued a communique with Adenauer after their meeting in Bonn, openly stating that "German sovereignty should be restored as soon as possible" and that "Germany should participate in a collective security system on a completely equal footing." This thoroughly exposed the American authorities' intention to achieve their goal of reviving German militarism by pulling West Germany into the North Atlantic bloc.
    Obviously, this new American plan is no different in its harmfulness to the security and national interests of European countries than the old plan to establish the "European Defense Community." The purpose of the United States in wanting to restore West Germany's "sovereignty" is, in fact, to keep Germany permanently divided and to give West German revanchists the opportunity to rebuild their aggressive forces and carry out expansion activities. Allowing West Germany to participate in the North Atlantic bloc as an "equal member state" will inevitably result in West Germany not only rearming without restriction, but also rapidly becoming the main partner of the United States in this aggressive bloc, and no country in this bloc will be able to prevent the West German aggressive forces from using the rebuilt Hitler "Wehrmacht" to implement its revanchist plans.
    Washington is making these arrangements while trying to completely disregard the opinions of France and other Western European countries. The American propaganda machine even released the air that the United States was prepared to unilaterally accelerate the rearmament of West Germany regardless of whether France agreed. Dulles also deliberately did not go to Paris on his trip to Western Europe to show his contempt and neglect for France. According to reports constantly coming from Washington on the eve of the nine-nation conference, the United States has drafted a plan for rearming West Germany regardless of French opposition, and is prepared to force France to agree at the meeting. This once again exposed that the American ruling group does not regard France as an equal major power at all, but only as a tool for it to realize the revival of German militarism.
    The British authorities are also very enthusiastic about the rearmament of West Germany. It took the lead in initiating arrangements for holding an eight- or nine-nation conference in London to rearm West Germany. Foreign Secretary Eden traveled to the capitals of Western European countries to carry out activities and put forward a plan advocating the expansion of the "Western European Union" established by the 1948 Brussels Treaty, which does not include the United States, to include West Germany and Italy, and to rearm West Germany within this group, and then include West Germany in the North Atlantic bloc.
    Everyone can see that the purpose of this plan is to establish a Western European group controlled by Britain to replace the stillborn "European Defense Community," that is, to realize the re-militarization of West Germany under a new "British-made" label. Britain is obviously trying to use this new trick to confuse French public opinion and reduce French resistance to the rearmament of West Germany. However, this attempt has long been seen through by the French public. The French bourgeois newspaper "Echo" openly criticized the Eden plan as actually restoring the "European Defense Community with a sugar coating" and allowing West Germany to "enter the North Atlantic Treaty Organization by detour."
    Britain's unusually keen interest in the rearmament of West Germany this time has another motive, which is to try to compete with the United States for leadership in Western Europe. The day after France rejected the "European Defense Community" treaty, the London "Times" revealed that the collapse of the "European Defense Community" plan gave Britain "a second chance to lead Europe." Britain advocates allowing West Germany to arm itself in the "Western European Union" without the participation of the United States in order to seize such an opportunity. Britain's plan naturally cannot but arouse strong reactions from the United States. West Berlin's "Telegraph" wrote not without reason: "Washington believes that if Western Europe reaches an agreement on a method to replace the European Defense Community due to the initiative of the British, and the United States does not need to play a leading role in it, it is intolerable." Therefore, when Britain proposed convening an eight-nation conference in early September, the United States expressed indifference. Recently, immediately following Eden's activities in Western European countries, Dulles not only immediately sent Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Murphy to Western Europe, but he also personally went to Bonn and London in an attempt to disrupt Britain's steps. Now, although Dulles attended the nine-nation conference initiated by Britain, Western news agencies and newspapers revealed that the competition between the United States and Britain for the leadership of the Western European military alliance has not ended.
    It is worth noting the position taken by the French government on this issue. It is well known that the decision of the French National Assembly to reject the "European Defense Community" treaty was welcomed by peace-loving people in Europe and other countries, and was regarded as a major victory in the French people's struggle against the revival of German militarism and the establishment of aggressive military blocs. According to a French Foreign Ministry spokesman on September 21, French Prime Minister Mendès France also knew that it would be very difficult for the French National Assembly to pass any measures to revive German militarism. However, now Mendès France has put forward a plan to establish a military bloc to arm West Germany, trying to convince people that the establishment of an arms limitation agency in this military bloc can ensure the effective prevention of the revival of West German militarism. The indisputable fact is that only by establishing a European collective security system and making Germany a unified and peaceful country can France obtain security guarantees and maintain its due status as a major power. The French people are very clear about this.
    What particularly makes the people of France and Western European countries unable to but maintain a high degree of vigilance is the attitude taken by the ruling groups of Western countries towards the Soviet Union's proposals for guaranteeing European collective security and peacefully resolving the German issue. They are doing their best to obstruct the holding of a four-power conference based on the Soviet proposal to discuss the German issue and a pan-European conference to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system. This undeniably shows that the formulators and followers of the policy of strength still want to disregard the wishes of the people of all countries, put the security of Europe and the peace of the world behind them, and try to accelerate the establishment of aggressive military blocs and support Germany's revanchist forces to strengthen their so-called "strength" position. However, the forces of peace are growing day by day, and no matter what plan the London nine-nation conference produces to revive German militarism, it will encounter stronger opposition from the people of all countries.

    复活德国军国主义的新阴谋
    谭文瑞
    英、美、法、荷、比、卢、西德、意大利和加拿大九国会议，已在九月二十八日在伦敦举行。西方通讯社毫不隐讳地指出，这个会议的实际目的是要制定一个重新武装西德的新计划，来代替已经失败了的“欧洲防务集团”计划。
    自从法国国民议会拒绝了“欧洲防务集团”条约之后，西方国家就展开了狂热的外交活动，以图寻找重新武装西德的新途径。大西洋两岸的政客们公开谈论各种各样重新武装西德的新计划，仿佛重新武装西德的勾当并不是违背了欧洲各国人民利益，现在要解决的问题只是用什么样的方式去把西德武装起来。
    美国统治集团过去就曾不止一次地扬言，如果“欧洲防务集团”条约为法国所拒绝，美国便要恢复西德的“主权”，并把它纳入北大西洋侵略集团之中。法国国民议会拒绝“欧洲防务集团”条约后的第二天，杜勒斯就威胁地说，重新武装西德是“难以更改”的事实，并建议召开北大西洋公约理事会，来接受美国的方案。后来杜勒斯到波恩与阿登纳会谈后发表公报，公然说“德国的主权应尽速恢复”，“应该让德国以完全平等的地位参加一个集体安全体系”。这都彻底地暴露了美国当局一心想用把西德拉到北大西洋集团内的方式，来实现其复活西德军国主义的目的。
    很显然，美国的这个新计划比起那个建立“欧洲防务集团”的旧计划来，对于欧洲各国安全和民族利益的危害性，是并无二致的。美国所谓要恢复西德“主权”的目的，事实上就是要使德国永远陷于分裂，并给西德复仇主义者以重建其侵略势力以及进行扩张活动的便利。让西德以“平等成员国”的资格参加北大西洋集团，其必然的后果就是西德不仅将无限制地重新武装，而且将迅速成为美国在这个侵略集团中的主要伙伴，在这个集团中就不可能有任何国家能够阻止西德侵略势力利用重建起来的希特勒“国防军”来实行其复仇计划了。
    华盛顿方面在进行这种安排的时候，竟然想完全不顾法国和其他西欧国家的意见。美国的宣传机器甚至放出这样的空气，说美国准备不管法国是否同意而独断专行地加速进行重新武装西德。杜勒斯前往西欧也故意不到巴黎，以表示对法国的轻蔑和冷落。据在九国会议举行前夕不断从华盛顿传出的消息透露，美国已拟好了不顾法国反对的重新武装西德的计划，准备在会上胁迫法国同意。这就再一次暴露了美国统治集团是根本不把法国作为一个平等的大国来看待，而只把法国当作其实现复活德国军国主义的工具。
    英国当局在重新武装西德的问题上也非常起劲。它争先发起在伦敦召开一个八国或九国会议来进行重新武装西德的安排，外交大臣艾登奔走于西欧各国首都进行活动，提出了一个方案，主张扩大没有美国参加的一九四八年的布鲁塞尔公约所建立的“西欧联盟”，把西德和意大利吸收进去，在这个集团之内来重新武装西德，然后再把西德包括到北大西洋集团之中。
    谁都看得出，这个计划的目的是要建立一个由英国控制的西欧集团来代替已经夭折的“欧洲防务集团”，也就是说要在一个“英国制”的新标志下来实现西德的重新军国主义化。英国显然是想拿这个新花招来迷惑法国的舆论，减少法国方面对重新武装西德的阻力。但是，这种图谋却早已为法国的公众所识破。法国资产阶级的“回声报”就公开指斥艾登计划实际上是要恢复“包上糖衣的欧洲防务集团”，而使西德“绕道进入北大西洋公约组织”。
    英国这一次在重新武装西德问题上所以表现异乎寻常的热心，还有其另外一个动机的，这就是企图和美国争夺西欧的领导权。在法国拒绝“欧洲防务集团”条约的第二天，伦敦“泰晤士报”就曾透露说：“欧洲防务集团”计划的垮台，给英国带来“领导欧洲的第二个机会”。英国主张让西德在没有美国参加的“西欧联盟”中进行武装，就是要抓住这样的机会。英国的这个打算自然不能不引起美国的强烈反应。西柏林的“电讯报”就不是毫无根据地写道：“华盛顿人士认为，如果西欧由于英国人的主动就代替欧洲防务集团的办法取得了一致意见，而不需要美国在其中起领导作用，那是不能容忍的。”因此，当英国在九月初提出的召开八国会议的建议的时候，美国表示冷淡。最近紧接着艾登到西欧各国活动，杜勒斯不仅立刻派了副国务卿帮办墨菲前往西欧，而且他还亲自出马到波恩和伦敦，以图设法打乱英国的步调。现在，杜勒斯虽然出席了英国所倡议的九国会议，但西方通讯社和报刊透露，美英争夺西欧军事联盟领导权的角逐，并没有结束。
    值得注意的是法国政府在这个问题上所采取的立场。人所共知，法国国民议会拒绝“欧洲防务集团”条约的决定，受到欧洲和其他国家爱好和平人民的欢迎，被认为是法国人民反对复活德国军国主义和建立侵略性军事集团的斗争的重大胜利。据法国外交部发言人九月二十一日说，法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯也知道，要法国国民议会通过任何复活德国军国主义的办法都是很难办得到的。但是，现在孟戴斯—弗朗斯却提出了一个建立军事集团来武装西德的计划，力图使人相信在这个军事集团中成立一个限制军备的机构就可以保证有效地防止西德军国主义复活。无可争辩的事实是，只有建立欧洲集体安全体系和使德国成为一个统一和平的国家，法国才能够获得安全的保障和保持其应有的大国地位。法国人民对这一点是看得很清楚的。
    特别使法国和西欧各国人民不能不保持高度警惕的，是西方国家统治集团对于苏联为保障欧洲集体安全与和平解决德国问题的建议采取的态度。它们竭力阻挠按照苏联的建议举行四大国会议讨论德国问题和召开全欧会议讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系的问题。这就无可辩驳地说明，实力政策的制订者和追随者依然想不顾各国人民的愿望，把欧洲的安全与世界的和平置诸脑后，力图加速建立侵略性的军事集团，扶植德国的复仇主义势力，以加强它们的所谓“实力”地位。但是，和平的力量正在日益增长，不论伦敦九国会议制造出什么样的复活德国军国主义的计划，都是会碰到各国人民更坚强的反对的。
