Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 15th.

Comrades and Deputies,

Drafting the Constitution of the People's Republic of China is a matter of great historical significance in our country's political life. The primary task of the First Session of the First National People's Congress is to draft our country's Constitution.

The draft Constitution submitted to this session has been carefully drafted.

On January 13, 1953, the Central People's Government Committee established the Constitution Drafting Committee of the People's Republic of China, with Comrade Mao Zedong as the head. The Constitution Drafting Committee, in March 1954, accepted the draft Constitution submitted by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. It then organized representatives from various democratic parties, people's organizations, and various sectors of society, totaling over 8,000 people in Beijing and major cities across the country, to discuss this draft over more than two months. It can be said that these 8,000 people are all participants in the drafting of the Constitution. Based on this draft, after revisions, the draft Constitution was published by the Central People's Government Committee on June 14, 1954, and submitted to the people across the country for discussion. The nationwide discussion lasted for more than two months, with over 150 million people participating. The broad masses of the people enthusiastically supported this draft Constitution and put forward many suggestions for revision and supplementation. Based on these suggestions, the Constitution Drafting Committee revised the original draft again and passed it through the 34th meeting of the Central People's Government Committee on September 9, 1954. This is how the draft Constitution submitted to this session was produced.

Now, I, on behalf of the Constitution Drafting Committee of the People's Republic of China, will report to the Congress on the draft Constitution.

I. The Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China is a Summary of Historical Experience

We are drafting the Constitution based on facts. What facts are we basing it on? These are the facts that our people have achieved a thorough victory in the long-term revolutionary struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism; that the people's democratic state led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants has been firmly established; and that our country has established a strong leading position in socialist economics, has begun systematic socialist transformation, and is gradually transitioning to a socialist society.

Based on these facts, the Constitution we are drafting can only be a people's democratic Constitution. This is a Constitution of the socialist type, not of the bourgeois type.

The draft Constitution we are proposing is a summary of the heroic struggle of the Chinese people over more than a hundred years, as well as a summary of the historical experience of modern China regarding constitutional issues and constitutional movements.

The Chinese people have long lived under the dark rule of imperialism and feudalism. More than a hundred years ago, foreign capitalism began to invade China, exposing the fact that the feudal dynasty at that time was completely incapable of defending its own country. Foreign invasions and oppression became increasingly severe, and domestic politics became increasingly dark. From that time on, such a large country as China actually lost its status as an independent state in foreign relations, and the broad masses of the people lived in extreme misery. However, it was at that time that the Chinese people began their heroic revolutionary struggle against foreign capitalism and domestic feudalism. Many advanced individuals, in order to save China and change the fate of their own country, strove to seek the truth. They studied Western bourgeois politics and culture, believing that the things of the Western bourgeoisie could save China. After learning these things, they attempted to change China's state and social systems according to the model of Western bourgeois states.

Sixty years ago, the reform movement led by Kang Youwei was an attempt to achieve this. They hoped that China could have a Constitution that would develop capitalism without fundamentally changing the feudal system. Their proposals were supported and endorsed by many people at that time. Although they were reformists, their reform movement had progressive significance under the conditions of the time and therefore aroused the enmity of the reactionaries. Their activities were suppressed and failed by the reactionaries led by Empress Dowager Cixi in 1898.

The reform movement led by Kang Youwei failed, but the Chinese people continued to fight against imperialism and feudalism. In the late Qing Dynasty, the revolutionary faction led by Sun Yat-sen emerged. This faction, unlike the reformists, pursued the ideal of establishing a bourgeois democratic republic and engaged in revolutionary struggles to overthrow the Qing Dynasty, which was a significant step forward compared to the reformists.

The rule of the Qing Dynasty could no longer be maintained under the rapid development of revolutionary forces. In order to maintain their rule and deceive the people to resist the people's revolution, nearly fifty years ago, the Qing Dynasty rulers announced "preparation for constitutionalism" and published a "Constitutional Outline." The main purpose of this "Constitutional Outline" was to preserve the feudal autocratic system, although it had to promise the people some demands on the surface, the people did not believe that such promises were genuine, and did not believe that such "constitutionalism" could advance China. The people resisted this deceptive "constitutionalism." At this time, the revolutionary faction led by Sun Yat-sen took a firm stance against this "constitutionalism," while the reformist faction led by Kang Youwei supported it. Therefore, the reformists were also opposed by the revolutionaries and abandoned by the people.

The revolutionary faction led by Sun Yat-sen firmly advocated achieving the democratic constitutionalism they aspired to through revolution, that is, bourgeois democratic constitutionalism. From the historical conditions at that time, they were correct in doing so, and they represented the aspirations of the broad masses of the people. Under their leadership, the great Revolution of 1911 finally broke out, which had great historical significance. The Revolution of 1911 overthrew the rule of the Qing Dynasty, ended the more than two-thousand-year-old feudal imperial system in China, and produced the Republic of China and the revolutionary provisional government in Nanjing led by Sun Yat-sen, as well as a provisional constitution. This provisional constitution had the character of a bourgeois republican constitution and was of progressive significance. The Revolution of 1911 made the concept of a democratic republic deeply rooted in people's hearts, and it was generally recognized that any speech or action contrary to this concept was illegal. However, the revolutionaries at that time had their shortcomings. They did not have a thorough program to oppose imperialism and feudalism, nor did they mobilize and organize the broad masses of the people who could be relied upon, and therefore they could not achieve a thorough victory over imperialism and feudalism. This revolution eventually failed, and the reactionary faction led by Yuan Shikai usurped state power. From then on, China entered the period of rule by various warlords of the Beiyang Clique, and the provisional constitution was torn up, and the "Republic of China" became an empty signboard. The revolutionary faction led by Sun Yat-sen fought against the Beiyang warlord government, but without success.

Under the rule of the Beiyang warlords, China's situation became worse and worse. All the major imperialist countries in the world were vying for control in China, supporting various warlords in China to wage continuous civil wars, plunging China into extreme chaos. One warlord after another seized control of the then Beijing government. The last so-called president of the Beiyang warlords, Cao Kun, in order to continue the rule of the warlords, published a deceptive "Constitution" in 1923. This "Constitution" was immediately rejected by the people at that time, and both the Kuomintang led by Sun Yat-sen and the Communist Party of China opposed this "Constitution," calling it a fake constitution. This fake constitution was published for only one year before Cao Kun's government collapsed.

Before and after the Revolution of 1911, all patriotic people in China could only seek a way out for China according to the capitalist direction. After the First World War and the October Socialist Revolution in Russia, the Chinese people began to see the decline of Western capitalism and the brilliant light of socialism. On May 4, 1919, a great revolutionary movement against imperialism and feudalism broke out in China. At this time, the Chinese workers' movement began to rise. The advanced elements among the Chinese people began to believe that the solution to China's problems was not the capitalist road, but the socialist road.

The correct belief of the advanced elements quickly became the belief of the broad masses. In 1921, China established the Marxist-Leninist party of the working class—the Communist Party of China. From then on, a new situation in the Chinese revolution was opened up, making the Chinese revolution a people's democratic revolution led by the working class, that is, a new democratic revolution, becoming part of the world socialist revolution, and obtaining the assistance of the socialist Soviet Union.

At this time, the great revolutionary Sun Yat-sen, from his many years of struggle, realized that to achieve the goal of saving the country, "one must arouse the masses and unite with the nations of the world that treat us equally to struggle together." He finally bravely adopted the three major policies of "uniting with the Soviet Union, uniting with the Communist Party, and assisting workers and peasants," forming an alliance with the Communist Party of China to fight against imperialism and feudalism, and launched a new revolutionary struggle.

In 1927, when the Northern Expedition revolutionary war jointly fought by the Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China was heading towards victory, Chiang Kai-shek of the Kuomintang betrayed Sun Yat-sen's policies and betrayed the revolution. From then on, the responsibility for leading the Chinese revolution was entirely borne by the working class of China and its party, the Communist Party of China. From then on, the depth, thoroughness, and broad mass scale of the Chinese revolution were unparalleled by any previous revolutionary movement. The Chinese people, through the Land Revolution War, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the War of Liberation, gradually created a strong revolutionary army and a vast revolutionary base area, and established a united front people's democratic government in the revolutionary base areas, carried out various social reforms, and gained rich revolutionary experience. Long-term revolutionary struggles have proven that the path from new democracy to socialism pointed out by the Communist Party of China is the only path that can save China. This path has established extremely high faith among the people of the whole country. After the end of the Second World War, the Chinese people finally defeated the reactionary faction of Chiang Kai-shek supported by American imperialism and achieved the great victory of the people's revolution in 1949.

Among the successive reactionary governments that ruled China, the Kuomintang government of Chiang Kai-shek was the last reactionary government, and it never wanted a constitution. But when it was on its deathbed, it also wanted to use a fake constitution to save its life. This fake constitution was strongly opposed by the Communist Party of China, the various democratic parties of China, and the people of the whole country, and the result was the same as that of the previous reactionary governments: within less than three years after Chiang Kai-shek published his fake constitution, his rule completely collapsed. At the same time, the Young China Party, the National Socialist Party, and other counter-revolutionary parties that supported this fake constitution were also despised by the people. This matter is well remembered by all the deputies present.

For more than a hundred years, the fierce struggle between the Chinese revolution and counter-revolution has never stopped. This fierce struggle is reflected in the issue of the state system, manifesting as three different forces demanding three different constitutions.

First, there are the fake constitutions created by the reactionary rulers from the Qing Dynasty, the Beiyang warlords, to the Kuomintang of Chiang Kai-shek. These feudal comprador class reactionary rulers opposed even bourgeois democracy. They originally did not want any constitution, so they always had to wait until their reactionary rule was on the verge of collapse under the blows of revolutionary forces, and their end was near, before they created a deceptive "constitution" to try to use some forms of bourgeois constitutions to decorate their facade, so that their reactionary rule could barely survive. Their purpose, of course, could not be achieved.

Second, there is the constitution that the Chinese national bourgeoisie has long hoped for, that is, the constitution of a bourgeois democratic republic. Apart from the provisional constitution produced by the Revolution of 1911 and immediately torn up by Yuan Shikai, China has never produced such a constitution.

There have been many nations in the world that, after breaking away from feudalism, established bourgeois republics. However, such a bourgeois republic, in a semi-colonial and semi-feudal China, has always been just a fantasy. The Chinese bourgeoisie, since it was unable to lead the people to defeat the combined forces of foreign imperialism and domestic reactionaries, could not turn China into a bourgeois republic, nor could it produce a bourgeois-type constitution.

Third, there is the constitution of a people's republic led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants, which is the constitution we are going to draft now.

Comrade Mao Zedong has long pointed out: After the victory of the people's revolution led by the working class, a republic of bourgeois dictatorship will not be established, but a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants will definitely be established. This people's republic led by the working class will only lead China to socialism, not to capitalism.

The matter is like this: The fake constitutions used several times by the reactionary rulers of the feudal comprador class to deceive people could not fool the people and were resisted by the people. Those who participated in the creation and actively supported such fake constitutions were also abandoned by the people. Indeed, several batches of reactionary rulers quickly collapsed after the announcement of the fake constitutions, and these so-called "constitutions" became waste paper. At the same time, for decades, although there have been many people in China who have made various efforts to realize bourgeois constitutionalism, there has been no achievement. The true constitution that has appeared in China can only be a people's democratic and socialist constitution, and only such a constitution is suitable for the interests of the broadest masses of the people and is welcomed by the broadest masses of the people.

Therefore, we say that the draft Constitution we are now proposing is a summary of the historical experience of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle over more than a hundred years, and it is also a summary of the historical experience of modern China regarding constitutional issues.

Of course, our draft Constitution is also a summary of the new historical experience since the founding of the People's Republic of China.

In 1949, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference drafted a common program. This common program served as a provisional constitution. This common program summarized the experience of past revolutions, especially the experience of the people's revolutionary base areas, announced the founding of the People's Republic of China, and determined the basic policies that the People's Republic of China should implement in various aspects. This common program was strictly implemented by the Central People's Government and local governments at all levels.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, although only five years have passed, the changes in our country have been tremendous.

First, our country has ended its status as a colony and a dependent country under the rule of foreign imperialism and has become a truly independent country. Comrade Mao Zedong solemnly declared at the opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in September 1949: "The Chinese people, who make up one-fourth of the world's population, have stood up." For more than a hundred years, the Chinese people have made countless sacrifices to rid themselves of the rule of foreign imperialism, and this goal has been achieved. Since 1950, the great movement to resist America and aid Korea has been launched nationwide, further strengthening our country's independent status. Our country has appeared on the international stage as a great power. Our country, together with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, has become a strong bastion for defending world peace.

Second, our country has ended the long-standing rule of feudalism. The feudal system of exploitation was the root cause of China's stagnation, backwardness, and humiliation, and this root cause has been completely eliminated by nationwide mass movements in most areas of our country.

Third, our country has ended the long-term chaotic situation, achieved domestic peace, and created an unprecedentedly unified situation across the entire mainland. The various nationalities in our country have ended the past situation of mutual discrimination and mistrust and have united closely on the basis of opposing imperialism and opposing the common enemies within each nationality, on the basis of national equality and mutual assistance and love.

Fourth, our country has ended the situation where the people have no rights over a wide range and has promoted high democracy. Through land reform and other social reforms, through the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the resistance against America and aid to Korea and other mass movements, the masses of the people have been organized. Countless people who were indifferent to national affairs in the past have actively participated in the political life of the state. The broad masses of the people across the country have deeply experienced that the People's Congress is the best political organizational form for managing their own country.

Fifth, due to the amazing enthusiasm and creativity shown by the people after liberation in the labor front, coupled with the assistance of our great ally, the Soviet Union, our country has, in a very short time, restored the national economy destroyed by imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary government, and has begun the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation. Socialist economy has, in actual life, undeniably proven to be far superior to capitalist economy, and it has become increasingly strong and increasingly consolidated its leading position in the national economy. The specific steps and measures taken by our state regarding the socialist cause have been supported by the broad masses of the people. Since 1953, our country has, according to the goal of building socialism, implemented the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy and has already achieved results.

This series of situations shows that our country has made great strides in the past five years, shows that once state power is in the hands of the organized and led people, it can unleash invincible power, liberate the people from miserable lives, and make our country progress by leaps and bounds, and improve the material and cultural lives of the people. This series of situations also shows why our country and government have obtained the support and trust of all the people and have obtained the sympathy and support of the people of the world who love peace.

In modern Chinese history, there has been a fundamental question that people have long debated: What is the way out for China? Is it capitalism or socialism? Regarding this question, the tremendous changes that have taken place in our country over the past five years have provided a vivid answer. The life of the past five years has fully proven that the transition from the current complex economic structure of society to a single socialist economic structure of society, that is, the transition from the current new democratic society to a socialist society, is the only correct path that our country should take.

Now, looking at it, does China have any other path to take?

American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique say to us: Our country should return to the old path of colonial and feudal rule. It is said that the people of our country are living in a "dark life," and they should come to "liberate" us. The People's Republic of China should be overthrown, and their reactionary rule should be restored, that is, the people of our country should return to the bloody rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Everyone knows that the people of the whole country, who have fought for more than a hundred years to obtain liberation, will never allow our country to return to this miserable old path. However, American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, as well as the spy counter-revolutionaries on the mainland, insist on making our country take this old path. Now, American imperialism is still occupying Taiwan, and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is still stationed in Taiwan continuing their evil deeds and constantly attempting to return to the mainland. The restoration of the reactionaries is still a real danger. If someone underestimates this danger, they will make a mistake. Therefore, the people of the whole country must always maintain a high degree of vigilance and must strive to strengthen our national defense forces and resolutely fight to liberate Taiwan and completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

Can our country still take the capitalist road and develop capitalism to become a capitalist country? Perhaps there are still some backward elements who have such illusions, but this is a very wrong and dangerous illusion. Comrade Mao Zedong has said, "The bourgeois republic, which other countries have had, China cannot have." Under the leadership of the working class today, the people of our country will never allow capitalism to spread in our country, and will never allow the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class to be transformed into bourgeois dictatorship. World capitalism has declined, and all the most developed capitalist countries in the world have reached a dead end, while the socialist Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries have become prosperous and strong. The people of our country, under the leadership of the working class, are building socialism, and the face of the country is changing, and the material and cultural lives of the people are gradually improving. In such an international and domestic situation, will the Chinese people want to abandon their bright and happy socialist future and take the painful path of capitalism? Of course not. Therefore, those who have such illusions must quickly abandon these illusions. If there are still people who do not want to abandon and insist on such illusions, they may go down the dangerous path indicated by imperialism. Because they insist on making China take the capitalist road, they will inevitably be connected with imperialist countries, but imperialists will not allow China to become an independent capitalist country, but will make China a colony ruled by imperialism and the comprador class. This is the path taken by the traitor Chiang Kai-shek.

Is there any other path for our country to take? Perhaps someone thinks of a path to maintain the status quo, that is, neither the capitalist path nor the socialist path, but to maintain the current state where there is both socialism and capitalism. Everyone knows that our country is in the transitional period of building a socialist society. In our country, this period is also called the new democratic period, and the characteristic of this period in the economy is that there is both socialism and capitalism. Some people hope to permanently maintain this state and would rather not change it. They say: The common program is enough, why do we need a constitution? In recent years, we often hear the saying "consolidating the new democratic order," which reflects the idea of maintaining the status quo. Is this possible? Socialism and capitalism, two opposite modes of production, cannot coexist in a country without interfering with each other. China will either become a socialist country or a capitalist country, and to make it not change is to make things stop moving, which is absolutely impossible. To become a capitalist country, I have already said before, this path is not viable. Therefore, our country has only the one bright path of socialism to take, and it cannot not take it, because this is the inevitable law of historical development.

From this, it can be seen that our country's path to socialism is unshakable. Apart from this, there is no other path to take.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, our country has embarked on the path of socialism. The preamble of the draft Constitution says: "From the founding of the People's Republic of China to the completion of a socialist society, this is a transitional period. The general task of the state in the transitional period is to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country and gradually complete the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce." Since 1953, our country has entered the period of planned economic construction according to the socialist goal, so we have a complete necessity to advance one step further on the basis of the common program and draft a constitution like the one submitted to you deputies now, to affirm the general task of our country in the transitional period in legal form.

To realize socialist industrialization and socialist transformation in our country is a very arduous and complex task. It is necessary to mobilize the strength of the people of the whole country, to give full play to the initiative and creativity of the broad masses of the people, and to overcome various difficulties under correct and highly unified leadership in order to accomplish such a task. Therefore, on the one hand, we must further promote people's democracy and expand the scale of our country's democratic system; on the other hand, we must establish a highly unified state leadership system. For such purposes, we also have a complete necessity to draft a more complete constitution like the one submitted to you deputies now.

The people of the whole country enthusiastically praised our draft Constitution in the discussion because this draft Constitution correctly summarized the historical experience of our country. This draft Constitution is the product of the interests and will of the people of our country, and it is the product of the tremendous changes that have taken place in our country.

The people praised this draft Constitution also because it correctly absorbed international experience. The Constitution Drafting Committee, when engaged in the drafting work, referred to the successive constitutions of the Soviet Union and the constitutions of various people's democratic countries. Obviously, the experience of the socialist advanced countries led by the Soviet Union has been of great help to us. Our draft Constitution combines the experience of China and international experience. Our draft Constitution is not only the product of the people's revolutionary movement in our country, but also a product of the international socialist movement.

The above is an explanation of the historical significance of our country's Constitution.

II. Explanation of Several Basic Contents of the Draft Constitution

Now, I will make some explanations about the basic contents of the draft Constitution, divided into the following four issues.

First, regarding the nature of our country

The first article of the draft Constitution stipulates: "The People's Republic of China is a people's democratic state led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants." The draft Constitution, in the preamble and many other articles, also shows that in our people's democratic system, there is still a broad people's democratic united front.

Only by relying on the leadership of the working class can the people of our country be liberated from the oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and this truth has long been proven by the long history of the past. After the people's victory, new problems have emerged: Can the working class lead the construction of the state as well as in the past? If some people took a wait-and-see attitude at the beginning, then the facts of the past five years have fully proven the extraordinary ability of the working class to lead the state. In order to consolidate the victory that the people of our country have already achieved, it is necessary to continue to consolidate and strengthen the leadership of the working class over the state. The cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation cannot be imagined without the leadership of the working class over the state.

Continuously consolidating and strengthening the alliance of workers and peasants is the basic guarantee for the leadership of the working class to achieve victory. This is the same in the past revolutionary wars of our country and in the current state construction. The alliance of workers and peasants of our country, which was forged in the revolutionary wars against imperialism and feudalism, has not weakened but has been further strengthened since the founding of the People's Republic of China. In the process of gradually transitioning to a socialist society, peasants will change, and this change has already begun, that is, from individual peasants with unstable economic lives to socialist cooperative peasants. Only by the working class leading the peasants to take the cooperative path can the living conditions of the peasants be continuously improved, and the alliance of workers and peasants can be more intimate and more consolidated.

Among the laboring people, in addition to workers and peasants, our country still has a considerable number of urban and rural individual handicraftsmen and other non-agricultural individual laborers who live by labor or mainly by labor. The working class must, like uniting with the peasants, unite these laboring people well to build socialism together. Uniting these laboring people is within the scope of the alliance of workers and peasants.

The leadership of the working class and the basis of the alliance of workers and peasants mark the fundamental nature of our country. This shows that our country is a people's democratic state. The people's democratic state and the capitalist state are fundamentally different in nature. In capitalist countries, no matter how much "democracy" is advocated, ultimately only a small minority of the population, the bourgeoisie, is in the ruling position of the state. In our country, the vast majority of the people are truly the masters of the state.

The intellectuals of our country have played a very important role in the past revolutionary movement and will play an even more important role in the future construction of socialism. Intellectuals come from various different social classes, and they themselves cannot constitute an independent social class. They can combine with the laboring people to become intellectuals of the laboring people, or they can combine with the bourgeoisie to become bourgeois intellectuals, and there are a few intellectuals who combine with the overthrown feudal comprador class to become reactionary intellectuals. Except for a few intellectuals who insist on a reactionary stance and engage in activities against the People's Republic of China, our country must pay attention to uniting all intellectuals, helping them to transform their ideology, and giving full play to their abilities to serve the cause of socialist construction. Comrade Mao Zedong has long said: "All intellectuals, as long as they have made achievements in serving the people, should be respected, and they should be regarded as the precious wealth of the state and society."

The preamble of the draft Constitution says: "In the future, in mobilizing and uniting the people of the whole country to complete the general task of the transitional period and the struggle against internal and external enemies, the people's democratic united front of our country will continue to play its role." This shows that in the transitional period of our country, the people's democratic united front led by the working class, including various democratic classes, various democratic parties, and various people's organizations, has an important role. This is a broader alliance based on the alliance of workers and peasants, that is, an alliance between laboring people and non-laboring people who can cooperate. Some people think that since we are going to build socialism, such an alliance will not exist and is not necessary, which is a wrong view.

Our country still has the national bourgeoisie in the transitional period. People know that as long as there are exploiting classes and exploited classes in society, class struggle will always exist. But our country was originally a country oppressed by foreign imperialism, and due to the special historical conditions of our country, there has been and still exists an alliance relationship between the working class and the national bourgeoisie. The national bourgeoisie has participated in the national democratic revolution under the leadership of the working class in the past, and in the past five years, it has also participated in patriotic movements and economic recovery work under the leadership of the state. After the serious struggles of "Three-Antis" and "Five-Antis," many capitalists have raised their awareness and expressed their willingness to accept socialist transformation. In this way, our country can adopt a policy of gradually carrying out socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and is indeed carrying out such transformation. In the transitional period, the national bourgeoisie still has an important role in the national economy. They can still make certain contributions to the state in expanding production, accepting socialist transformation, improving enterprise management and production technology, and training and training technical workers and technical personnel. In the transitional period, the national bourgeoisie also has a certain political position.

In our society, especially among the various national minorities, there are still patriotic figures of other class compositions, and the state must also unite them well.

From this, it can be seen that the united front of our country still has a broad foundation.

The Communist Party of China has long pointed out that the great unity of the people of the whole country under the leadership of the working class is not only necessary for the people's democratic revolution of our country but is also necessary for the realization of the socialist cause. Because imperialism is still standing in front of us. At the same time, in our country, the choice of the road for the people is actually only two: either to be enslaved by imperialism again or to realize socialism. China wants to be independent, democratic, and prosperous, and can only take the road to socialism. In this situation, all those who do not want to be colonial slaves will have the possibility of uniting under the leadership of the working class to accept the socialist road. On the premise of continuing to consolidate the leadership of the working class and the alliance of workers and peasants, in the possible range, the broader the unity among the people, the better it is for the socialist cause. Therefore, our Constitution should be a Constitution for the great unity of the people of the whole country to build a socialist society.

Second, regarding the steps to transition to a socialist society

The fourth article of the draft Constitution stipulates: "The People's Republic of China, relying on state organs and social forces, through socialist industrialization and socialist transformation, will gradually eliminate the system of exploitation and build a socialist society."

To implement the policy stipulated in the fourth article, the draft Constitution also makes many provisions in other articles in the general provisions. These provisions not only indicate the general goal of building a socialist society but also indicate the specific steps of building a socialist society.

Our country still has various economic components in the transitional period. At present, the ownership of the means of production in our country mainly includes: state ownership, that is, public ownership; cooperative ownership, that is, collective ownership by the laboring masses; individual ownership by laborers; and capitalist ownership. The task of the state is to strive to consolidate and develop the first two economic components, that is, the socialist economic components, so the state must "ensure the priority development of the state-owned economy" and especially pay attention to gradually establishing the main economic base of socialism, heavy industry, while "encouraging, guiding, and helping the development of the cooperative economy."

The provisions of the draft Constitution are not fantasized but are based on the changes in social and economic relations since the founding of the People's Republic of China and the experience of the broad masses, so they are all feasible. Regarding these provisions, I would like to talk about the following several issues.

First, regarding the issue of transitional forms. We know that realizing the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce is a very arduous task. We cannot possibly complete such a transformation in a short period. We must proceed step by step based on the experience and awareness of the masses and the actual possibilities. Our experience has proven that in the process of socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, or capitalist industry and commerce, there can be transitional forms, and it is completely necessary to adopt flexible and diverse transitional forms.

In the socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts, the main transitional form is the collective ownership of the laboring masses in the form of cooperatives, such as the agricultural production cooperatives that have begun to develop in the rural areas of our country in recent years, characterized by land shares and unified management. Under the historical conditions of our country, we can gradually and widely use this semi-socialist cooperative economy as a transitional form to lead the broad individual laborers to relatively smoothly transition to the collective ownership of the laboring masses.

In the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, the transitional form is state capitalism. Under the historical conditions of our country, we can gradually realize the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce through various forms of state capitalism. State capitalism under the leadership of the working class in the state management and state capitalism under the rule of the bourgeoisie have fundamentally different natures. This is what Lenin said, "a kind of capitalism that we can restrict and define its scope." In the state capitalist economy, on the one hand, the private ownership of capitalists has not been abolished, and capitalists still have profits to obtain, on the other hand, capitalists can no longer act arbitrarily for profit. Through this transitional form of state capitalism, it is possible to create favorable conditions for replacing capitalist ownership with public ownership in the future.

The draft Constitution clearly stipulates these transitional forms, which is of great significance to the socialist transformation cause of our country.

Next, I would like to talk about the issue of building a socialist society through a peaceful path. In the people's discussion, many people asked: Why does the preamble of the draft Constitution say that our people's democratic system can ensure that our country eliminates exploitation and builds a socialist society through a peaceful path?

In our country, the feudal system of exploitation, except in a few places, has been completely eliminated in the process of revolutionary war and land reform. To build a socialist society, it is necessary to further eliminate the capitalist system of exploitation. This is a further social change. In capitalist countries, the working class and other laboring masses must overthrow the state system of bourgeois dictatorship to carry out such a social change. However, the political and economic situation of our country is completely different from that of capitalist countries. Our country has already established a people's democratic state system led by the working class. Our country already has a increasingly strong socialist state-owned economy, which has become the leading force of the entire national economy, while capitalist economy no longer occupies a dominant position in our country. Therefore, the socialist revolution of our country is also different from that of capitalist countries. In our country, there is no such issue as overthrowing the bourgeois state system. We can rely on the current state organs and social forces to gradually carry out socialist transformation. At the same time, as mentioned earlier, in our country, the working class has an alliance relationship with the national bourgeoisie, so in our country, the elimination of the capitalist system of exploitation can also not adopt the way of carrying out a mass movement in a short period of time, such as the land reform from 1950 to 1952, which eliminated the feudal land system in a short period of time. The socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce by the state will take a considerable period of time and will be gradually realized through various forms of state capitalism. We will give capitalists a necessary period of time to gradually accept transformation under the leadership of the state and the working class. Of course, there will definitely be struggles, there are now, and there will be in the future. Now there are some capitalists who engage in various illegal activities, and some people also adopt a resistant attitude towards socialist transformation. Therefore, the draft Constitution stipulates: "The state prohibits all illegal acts of capitalists that harm public interests, disrupt the social economic order, and sabotage the state economic plan." The idea that there is no class struggle in our country is completely wrong. Those capitalists who engage in illegal and sabotage activities should be punished. From restricting capitalist exploitation to eliminating capitalist exploitation, it is impossible to imagine that there will be no complex struggles, but it is possible to achieve the goal through the management of state administrative organs, the leadership of the state-owned economy, and the supervision of the working masses, using the method of peaceful struggle. As long as capitalists understand the trend of the times and are willing to accept socialist transformation, do not engage in illegal activities, and do not sabotage the property of the people, then they will receive care from the state, and their future living and working arrangements will be appropriately handled, and their political rights will not be deprived. This is quite different from our policy towards the feudal landlord class. All these, that is, the leadership of the working class over the state and the consolidated alliance of workers and peasants, the leading position of socialist economy in the national economy, the domestic united front relationship, and the favorable international conditions, are the necessary conditions for our country to eliminate the system of exploitation and build a socialist society through a peaceful path.

Regarding the socialist transformation of various minority nationalities, it is even more necessary to fully pay attention to the characteristics of the development of various nationalities. I will talk about this issue later.

Next, regarding the issue of rich peasants. In the people's discussion, many people asked: How should the provision in the draft Constitution that "the state adopts a policy of restricting and gradually eliminating rich peasant economy" be understood? We believe that the rich peasant economy is the capitalist economy in the countryside, and rich peasants are the last exploiting class in the countryside. In our country, the rich peasant economy was originally not developed. In the land reform, the part of the land rented by rich peasants has been distributed. After the land reform, due to the development of agricultural cooperation, supply and marketing cooperation, credit cooperation in the countryside, and the implementation of the state's policy of unified purchase and sale of grain and other major agricultural products, the rich peasant economy has been greatly restricted. Although a few new rich peasants have emerged in the countryside, generally speaking, the rich peasant economy is not rising but declining. Now, the average land owned by each rich peasant is only twice as much as that owned by ordinary peasants. In the past, rich peasants rarely employed workers or employed very few workers, and those who lent money at high interest have decreased, and those who engaged in commerce have also been greatly restricted. Therefore, in our country, it is possible to use the method of cooperation and restricting the development of the rich peasant economy to gradually eliminate the capitalist economy in the countryside. Of course, struggle is inevitable, and the sabotage activities of rich peasants cannot be ignored. In many places, it has been found that rich peasants resist unified purchase and sale and sabotage mutual aid cooperation. Those rich peasant elements who engage in sabotage activities must be punished. However, from the overall political and economic situation of our country, in the future, it will not be necessary to launch a special movement like the land reform to eliminate rich peasants. In the future, for those original rich peasants who have abandoned exploitative behavior, it is possible, on the premise that the local agricultural production cooperatives have been consolidated, according to certain conditions, and after obtaining the consent of the peasants, to let them participate in the cooperatives in different ways and continue to transform them.

Next, in the people's discussion, many people also asked: The draft Constitution, on the one hand, stipulates that the state protects the ownership of production materials and other ownership of capitalists according to law, and on the other hand, it stipulates that it is necessary to carry out socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and gradually replace capitalist ownership with public ownership, is this not contradictory?

If there is any contradiction here, then this reflects the contradiction in objective life. In the transitional period of our country, there is both socialism and capitalism, and the contradiction between these two systems of ownership is an objective contradiction. At the same time, capitalist industry and commerce in the current stage have both their beneficial effects on the national economy and people's livelihood and their adverse effects on the national economy and people's livelihood, which is also an objective contradiction of capitalist industry and commerce itself. Our policy to solve the contradiction between socialism and capitalism is to, on the one hand, allow the existence of capitalist ownership and make use of the beneficial effects of capitalist industry and commerce on the national economy and people's livelihood, and on the other hand, restrict the adverse effects of capitalist industry and commerce on the national economy and people's livelihood, adopt transitional measures, prepare conditions, and gradually replace capitalist ownership with public ownership. The specific steps regarding the transition to a socialist society stipulated in the draft Constitution are precisely to correctly solve this contradiction.

Under the specific conditions of our country, we believe that the principles and methods we have adopted to build socialism are correct. This truth can also be confirmed from the opposite side, that is, from the shouts of the enemy and the comments of some foreign bourgeois newspapers.

Imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in Taiwan are very unhappy with our building of socialism, and they attack us every day. Is this strange? Originally, we did the right thing.

Some foreign bourgeois newspapers have found with disappointment that the path announced in our draft Constitution is "the path that the Soviet Union has taken." Yes, the path we are taking is the path that the Soviet Union has taken, and we have no doubt about this. The path of the Soviet Union is the path that human society must take according to the law of historical development. It is impossible to avoid this path. We have always believed that Marxism-Leninism is a universal truth.

To sabotage our socialist cause, cunning enemies have specially hired some people, such as Trotskyites and Chen Duxiu elements, who disguise themselves as "leftists" and attack the specific steps and specific measures of our socialist transformation cause. They say that we are doing it "too incompletely," "too compromising," and "deviating from Marxism." They want to confuse people's vision with such nonsense. They want us to break the alliance with the national bourgeoisie and immediately expropriate the national bourgeoisie. They also complain that our agricultural policy is "too slow," and they want us to break the alliance with the peasants. Are these not all nonsense? If we do as they say, then only imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitors will be the happiest.

Our people have a firm goal of building socialism and practical specific steps, which cannot but make our enemies very unhappy. The thing that our enemies are most unhappy about is the best thing for our people, which is not worth saying.

Third, regarding the people's democratic political system and the rights and duties of the people

The second article of the draft Constitution stipulates: "All power in the People's Republic of China belongs to the people. The organs through which the people exercise their power are the National People's Congress and the local people's congresses at various levels." This provision and some provisions in other articles show that our country's political system is the people's congress system. Based on the long-term experience of political construction in the people's revolutionary base areas of our country and referring to the experience of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, five years ago, our common program determined this political system of our country. The draft Constitution summarizes the experience of the work of state organs over the past five years and the experience of people's congresses at all levels and all walks of life, and makes more complete provisions for our country's political system. We adopt this political system, which is related to the fundamental nature of our country. The Chinese people want to use such a political system to ensure that the country advances along the path of socialism.

Title: The People's Congress System and the Constitution
Author:
Date: 1954-09-20
Page: 1

The People's Congress system has become the most suitable political system for our country because it facilitates the people in exercising their power and allows the masses to participate in the management of the state through such political organizations. This enables the people to fully mobilize their enthusiasm and creativity. Obviously, without a suitable political system that allows the people to manage the state, the masses cannot be effectively organized and mobilized to build socialism.

In our country, all levels of people's congresses are elected on the basis of universal suffrage. The draft constitution stipulates that all citizens who have reached the age of eighteen, regardless of nationality, race, gender, occupation, social origin, religious belief, educational level, property status, or length of residence, have the right to vote and to be elected. Due to current conditions, our country must, for a certain period, deprive feudal landlords and bureaucratic capitalists of their right to vote and to be elected, as stipulated by law. Additionally, different population ratios must be set for urban and rural areas, and a multi-level election system must be implemented. In primary elections, the majority of methods used are hand-raising. Our election system is to be gradually improved, and when conditions are ripe, we will implement a fully universal, equal, direct, and secret ballot system. However, the current election system is suitable for our country's current situation, most convenient for the people, and can accommodate various ethnic minorities and democratic classes, ensuring they have appropriate representation. From such elections, all levels of people's congresses are produced, which can fully represent the will of the people. Therefore, these are highly democratic people's representative organs.

According to the draft constitution, the National People's Congress exercises the highest state power in a unified manner. Our state administrative organs, from the State Council to local people's committees, are all produced by the National People's Congress and local people's congresses, which are state power organs, and are supervised by them and can be removed by them. Therefore, our state administrative organs cannot act independently of the people's congresses or against their will. In accordance with our country's actual situation and based on the experience of building the highest state power organ since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the state leadership is exercised jointly by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the President of the People's Republic of China. Our state leader is a collective state leader. At the same time, neither the Standing Committee nor the President of the People's Republic of China has power beyond the National People's Congress.

In our country, major state affairs are not decided by one or a few people. Since the People's Congress system is established as the fundamental political system of the state, all major issues should be discussed and decided by the People's Congress. National-level major issues are discussed and decided by the National People's Congress, and during its recess, they are discussed and decided by its Standing Committee; local major issues are discussed and decided by local people's congresses. Our People's Congress is thus a state power organ that can make decisions on major issues and supervise their implementation.

The draft constitution's second article, second paragraph, stipulates: "The National People's Congress, local people's congresses at all levels, and other state organs all practice democratic centralism." Through the People's Congress system, we unify and concentrate the exercise of state power, which demonstrates our democratic centralism. In a reactionary publication in Hong Kong, it is said that our "People's Congress system is a system of centralized power." These reactionaries think they have found a reason to attack us. However, we Marxist-Leninists have long openly declared that we advocate centralism. The question is what kind of centralism: is it the centralized power of a few big feudal lords or big capitalists, or is it the democratic centralism of the people led by the working class? These two kinds of centralism are completely different. As stipulated in the draft constitution, we here combine high centralism with high democracy. Our political system has high centralism, but this high centralism is based on high democracy.

When the people were still in a position of oppression, they could not fully concentrate their will and strength. In the past, the Chinese people were ridiculed as a "heap of loose sand" for this reason. Revolution has concentrated the will and strength of the people. And when the people have been liberated and established their own state, they naturally want to fully concentrate their will and strength into the state organs, making the state organs a powerful weapon. The stronger the people's state organs are, the more capable they are of defending the people's interests, guaranteeing the people's democratic rights, and guaranteeing the construction of socialism.

In Comrade Mao Zedong's book "On Coalition Government," when talking about our country's political system, he clearly pointed out: "It is democratic and centralized, that is, centralized on a democratic basis, and democratic under centralized guidance." This is our principle.

Many people often mistakenly regard democracy and centralism as two absolutely opposing and incompatible things. They think that if there is democracy, there cannot be centralism, and if there is centralism, there cannot be democracy. They see the political unity of the people in our state organs and the high degree of unified leadership nationwide, and try to prove that there is "no democracy" here. Their mistake lies in their failure to understand people's democracy and thus their inability to understand the centralism based on people's democracy.

The common interests and unified will of the people are the starting point for the work of the People's Congress and all state organs. Therefore, in all these state organs, people's political unity can be formed on a democratic basis. However, political unity does not mean the cancellation or reduction of criticism and self-criticism. On the contrary, criticism and self-criticism are an extremely important manifestation of our democratic life. In all state organs, there will always be shortcomings and errors in work, so in the meetings of the National People's Congress, in the meetings of local people's congresses at all levels, and in the daily activities of all state organs, criticism and self-criticism must be fully carried out. We must use the weapons of criticism and self-criticism to promote the work of state organs, continuously correct shortcomings and errors, oppose bureaucratism that is detached from the masses, and ensure that state organs always maintain close ties with the masses and correctly reflect the will of the people. If there is no full criticism and self-criticism, it will not be possible to achieve and maintain people's political unity. Suppressing criticism is a criminal act in our state organs.

From the perspective of the bourgeoisie, it is impossible to understand our country's political system. Many bourgeois newspapers in foreign countries have commented on the political system in our draft constitution. Some people are surprised by the extensive powers of our People's Congress and say, "Especially the powerful authority of the National People's Congress is astonishing." Others are debating whether the position of the President of the People's Republic of China is like that of the President of France or the President of the United States. These commentators always try to measure our system with the political system of bourgeois states or based on some strange ideas they have. But unfortunately, they have not seen the biggest and most fundamental thing; they have not seen the great changes that have taken place in Chinese history. This change is that the Chinese people, led by the working class, have become the masters of China.

Some foreign bourgeois commentators attack our country's centralism and the people's collectivism and, based on this, say that in our country, there is "no personal freedom" and "neglect of personal interests." Therefore, I want to talk about the issue of whether high centralism and the people's collectivism hinder the personal interests and personal freedom of the people.

In many articles of the draft constitution, it is stipulated that citizens of our country enjoy extensive freedoms and rights. The draft constitution stipulates that citizens have the freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association, procession, and demonstration, and the state should provide the necessary material facilities to ensure that citizens enjoy these freedoms. The draft constitution also stipulates: "The personal freedom of citizens is inviolable. No citizen may be arrested without a decision by a people's court or approval by a people's procuratorate." "The homes of citizens are inviolable, and the secrecy of correspondence is protected by law." "Citizens have the freedom of residence and migration." The draft constitution also stipulates that citizens have the right to labor and the right to receive education, that laborers have the right to rest, and that when they are old, sick, or lose the ability to work, they have the right to material assistance. The state will gradually expand the currently insufficient material conditions to ensure that citizens enjoy these rights. In addition, the draft constitution also stipulates that citizens have the freedom of religious belief. Our state can care for the freedom and rights of every citizen, of course, determined by our country's state system and social system. The people of any capitalist country do not have and cannot have such extensive personal freedoms as our people.

Some foreign commentators see that on the one hand, we want to defend the democratic freedoms and rights of the people, and on the other hand, we want to suppress all treasonous and counter-revolutionary activities and punish all traitors and counter-revolutionaries, and they find this strange. Of course, if someone hopes that we will guarantee the freedom of traitors and counter-revolutionaries in the constitution, they will only be disappointed. For those who intend to enslave us, foreign imperialists and their running dogs, our constitution and all laws will never give them any convenience. Isn't it precisely because we deprive traitors and counter-revolutionaries of their freedom that the people have true freedom?

Some foreign commentators see that on the one hand, we guarantee citizens' freedom of religious belief, and on the other hand, we punish those who, under the guise of religion, actually engage in counter-revolutionary activities, and they find this strange. Of course, if someone hopes that we will protect the freedom of those imperialist elements and traitors who, under the guise of religion, engage in counter-revolutionary activities, they will also be disappointed. According to the provisions of the draft constitution, our state will, as in the past, genuinely guarantee citizens' freedom of religious belief. However, guaranteeing religious freedom and guaranteeing the freedom of counter-revolutionary activities are two absolutely different things. Our constitution and all laws will similarly never give any convenience to those who, under the guise of religion, engage in counter-revolutionary activities. There is nothing difficult to understand about this.

Under the capitalist system, the state only guarantees the interests and freedoms of a few members of the exploiting class while depriving the interests and freedoms of the vast majority. In our country, on the contrary, we absolutely do not allow anyone to hinder the interests and freedoms of the majority for the sake of personal or minority interests and freedoms, and to hinder the public interests of the state and society. For this reason, the draft constitution's Article 14 stipulates: "The state prohibits anyone from using private property to harm public interests." In our country, the so-called "freedom" that harms public interests, of course, must be restricted and prohibited. However, our state fully cares for and considers personal interests. The public interests of our state and society cannot be separated from personal interests; socialism and collectivism cannot be separated from personal interests. Our state fully guarantees the public interests of the state and society, and these public interests are the basis for satisfying the personal interests of the people.

Our state can inspire the broad masses of the people to actively participate in the public life of the state and society, and make the people, from the perspective of collectivism, consciously abide by their various duties to society and the state in public life. This is proof that our people's democratic system is in line with the interests of the people. Will the people, because they have collectivism and have fulfilled their duties to society and the state, lose their personal interests and personal freedom? Of course not. Under the people's democratic system and socialist system, the people can experience that the public interests of the state and society and personal interests are inseparable and consistent. Under the people's democratic system and socialist system, the people have complete democratic rights and at the same time have complete duties. Since the people fully exercise state power, they will also fulfill their duties as masters.

In our country, the rights and duties of the people are completely consistent. No one will only fulfill duties without enjoying rights; no one can only enjoy rights without fulfilling duties. The draft constitution stipulates that citizens must abide by the constitution and laws, abide by labor discipline, abide by public order, respect public morality, and have the duty to love and protect public property, the duty to pay taxes according to law, and the duty to serve in the military according to law. The draft constitution also stipulates, "Defending the motherland is the sacred duty of every citizen of the People's Republic of China." These duties stipulated in the draft constitution are duties that every citizen must abide by without exception. The provisions of the draft constitution will further enhance the people's sense of solemn responsibility towards our great motherland. Because our state is the people's state, the interests of the state and the people are completely consistent, the people will naturally regard their duties to the state as their own duties. Anyone who tries to shirk these duties will inevitably be criticized by society.

The people of our country are willing to contribute their strength to defend our motherland, to continuously strengthen the people's democratic system, and to participate in the great cause of socialism, of course, because the stronger our motherland is, the more powerful our people's democratic system is, and the more our socialist cause advances, the more the freedoms and rights of the people will be guaranteed and expanded.

Fourth, on the issue of national regional autonomy

The preamble and many other articles of the draft constitution stipulate the equal, friendly, and mutually supportive relationship among various ethnic groups within the country, and guarantee the autonomy rights of various ethnic minorities.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the system of ethnic oppression has been abolished, and a new relationship of equality, friendship, and mutual support among various ethnic groups within the country has been established. The political, economic, and cultural undertakings in various ethnic minority areas have begun to develop gradually, and the people's lives have begun to improve gradually. Our country has become a family of free and equal ethnic groups. The draft constitution summarizes the experience in this regard and makes more detailed provisions on national regional autonomy and the political, economic, and cultural construction of various ethnic minorities than the Common Program.

Our country is a people's democratic country led by the working class and is moving towards the goal of building a socialist society. Therefore, our country can use thorough democratic spirit and ethnic equality to solve ethnic issues and establish true cooperation among various ethnic groups within the country. We firmly believe that we must allow all ethnic groups within the country to actively participate in the political life of the entire country, and at the same time, allow various ethnic groups to manage their internal affairs according to the principle of national regional autonomy. In this way, historical ethnic prejudices and discrimination can be eliminated, and mutual trust and unity among ethnic groups can be continuously enhanced.

The draft constitution clearly stipulates that citizens of our country, regardless of ethnicity or race, all enjoy equal rights, and declares that any discrimination and oppression against any ethnic group is illegal in our country. The draft constitution also stipulates that various ethnic groups have the freedom to use and develop their own languages and scripts and the freedom to maintain or reform their own customs and habits. The draft constitution has affirmed, in the form of law, the principles of people's democracy and socialism that our country adheres to in ethnic issues and the specific measures that should be taken according to these principles.

The draft constitution reflects the consistency of the interests of various ethnic groups in our country. For more than a hundred years, various ethnic groups in our country, including the Han ethnic group and various brotherly ethnic groups, have suffered together from the oppression of foreign imperialism. Imperialists have used various plots to destroy the long-term historical connections formed among various ethnic groups in our country and to implement their policy of "divide and rule." The founding of the People's Republic of China has liberated all ethnic groups in China from imperialist oppression, but imperialists are still scheming, hoping to separate various ethnic groups in our country and achieve their goal of re-enslaving various ethnic groups in our country. Facing the imperialists' plot of aggression, various ethnic groups in our country must be vigilant and not give imperialists any opportunity to carry out their plots. Various ethnic groups in our country must strengthen and consolidate the unity of our motherland and must stand together to strive for the construction of a great motherland. The draft constitution declares that the People's Republic of China is a unified multi-ethnic country and declares that various ethnic autonomous areas are inseparable parts of the People's Republic of China. Obviously, such provisions are completely necessary and completely in line with the common interests of various ethnic groups in our country.

The draft constitution, through various provisions, ensures that various ethnic minorities in their concentrated areas can truly exercise autonomy rights. The autonomous organs of ethnic autonomous areas not only exercise the powers of general local state organs but also, according to the powers stipulated by the constitution and laws, manage the finances of their local areas, organize local public security forces according to the state's military system, and can formulate autonomous regulations and single regulations to adapt to the political, economic, and cultural characteristics of local ethnic groups. The form of the autonomous organs of ethnic autonomous areas can be determined according to the wishes of the majority of the people of the ethnic groups implementing regional autonomy. When the autonomous organs perform their duties, they should use the commonly used languages and scripts of local ethnic groups. In areas where only one township is inhabited by ethnic groups, although it is not necessary and not possible to establish autonomous organs to exercise the various autonomy rights mentioned above, ethnic townships should still be established to adapt to the special situation of the concentrated ethnic groups.

It must be pointed out that both great-nation chauvinism and local nationalism are wrong. This kind of thought is harmful to the unity of various ethnic groups in our country and to the implementation of national regional autonomy. From the preamble of the draft constitution, we can see that in order to continue to strengthen ethnic unity, we must not only oppose imperialism and the public enemies within various ethnic groups but also oppose great-nation chauvinism and local nationalism.

The Han ethnic group accounts for an extremely large proportion of the population in our country. Due to historical conditions, the political, economic, and cultural development of the Han ethnic group is also relatively high among various ethnic groups in our country. However, this does not mean that the Han ethnic group can enjoy any special privileges or show any arrogance in front of other brotherly ethnic groups. On the contrary, the Han ethnic group has a special duty to help the development of various brotherly ethnic groups. Various ethnic minorities, although they have already obtained the rights of ethnic equality, still cannot quickly overcome their originally backward economic and cultural conditions if they rely only on their own conditions and strength. Therefore, the help of the Han ethnic group is very important to them. The Han people, especially Han cadres sent to work in various ethnic minority areas, must always consider the economic and cultural development and the improvement of living standards of ethnic minorities, serve ethnic minorities wholeheartedly, and patiently help local ethnic cadres to gradually grow up so that they can take on the various leadership responsibilities of their own regions. Due to the influence of the past reactionary ruling class, there still exists a great-nation chauvinist ideology among the Han people, and even among Han cadres. For example: not respecting the customs and habits of ethnic minorities, not respecting the languages and scripts of ethnic minorities, not acknowledging that ethnic minorities have the freedom of religious belief, not acknowledging that ethnic minorities have the right to manage their internal affairs, working in ethnic minority areas but not respecting ethnic minority cadres, not consulting with them on matters, and not believing that they can improve their ability to manage various affairs in actual work, etc. Undoubtedly, this great-nation chauvinist ideology and behavior will certainly have a destructive effect on ethnic unity and is completely unacceptable to our state system. The Han people and Han working cadres must always pay attention to overcoming great-nation chauvinist ideology. On the other hand, there exists a local nationalist ideology in various ethnic minorities. This local nationalism and great-nation chauvinism are both long-term historical relics. It should be pointed out that this local nationalist ideology and behavior are equally detrimental to the unity of various ethnic groups and are equally harmful to their own ethnic interests, so they must also be overcome.

Building a socialist society is the common goal of various ethnic groups within our country. Only socialism can guarantee that every ethnic group can achieve high economic and cultural development. Our country has the responsibility to help each ethnic group within the country gradually walk on this happy path.

However, various ethnic groups have different historical conditions, and it is impossible to think that various ethnic groups within the country will enter socialism at the same time and in the same way. The preamble of the draft constitution says: "The state will consider the needs of various ethnic groups in the process of economic and cultural construction and will fully pay attention to the characteristics of the development of various ethnic groups in the issue of socialist transformation." This means that in issues such as when and how to carry out socialist transformation, there will be differences due to the different development situations of various ethnic groups. In all these issues, it should be allowed for the people of various ethnic groups and public leaders who have connections with the people of various ethnic groups to consider carefully and make decisions according to their wishes.

In some ethnic minority areas, the cause of socialist transformation will begin later than in the Han areas, and the time required for their socialist transformation will also be longer. When these ethnic minorities carry out socialist transformation, the socialist cause may have already achieved great results in most areas of the country, and the socialist transformation cause of these ethnic minorities will also have more favorable conditions, because at that time the state will have more material strength to help them. The broad masses of ethnic minorities, seeing the benefits of the victory of socialism in the national scope, will also want to take this path. Even if there are still a few people who are concerned that socialist transformation will harm their personal interests, the state will also adopt necessary policies to properly arrange their lives. Therefore, socialist transformation in ethnic minority areas can be gradually realized with more time and a more gradual approach. Ethnic minority areas that have not yet completed democratic reform can also complete democratic reform in a more gradual way in the future and then gradually transition to socialism. In our country, in various ethnic minorities, as long as one supports the people's democratic system and unites in the family of the motherland, one will definitely have a bright future and a way out in the socialist society. This is certain.

The above is an explanation of the basic content of the draft constitution.

Third, on the opinions raised during the nationwide discussion on the draft constitution

During the nationwide discussion of the draft constitution, the people raised many opinions on amendments and supplements, as well as some questions. Regarding these opinions and questions, some have already been answered by me earlier, and now I will talk about the other part of the opinions and questions raised by the people during the discussion of the draft constitution.

The opinions raised by the people have all been considered by the Constitution Drafting Committee. Among these opinions, some involve issues that are not within the scope of the constitution but within the scope of other laws, and these opinions should be handled when formulating other laws.

Due to the adoption of the people's opinions, the draft constitution has undergone several changes, some of which are changes in content, and some are changes in language and rhetoric. Here, it is not necessary to list every change made in the draft constitution that has been modified and presented to the representatives. I will only mention the following few relatively important changes and explain them.

First, regarding the amendment to the third paragraph of Article 3 of the draft constitution. This paragraph stipulates: "Various ethnic groups all have the freedom to develop their own languages and scripts and the freedom to maintain or reform their own customs and religious beliefs." This was originally a provision with the same content as the Common Program. Someone suggested that in this paragraph, not only should it be stipulated that various ethnic groups all have the freedom to develop their own languages and scripts, but it should also be stipulated that various ethnic groups all have the freedom to use their own languages and scripts. Another person proposed that since Article 88 of the draft constitution already stipulates "Citizens of the People's Republic of China have the freedom of religious belief," the provision in this paragraph about the freedom to maintain or reform religious beliefs is redundant and should be deleted. The Constitution Drafting Committee believes that these suggestions are correct, so the third paragraph of Article 3 was amended to read: "Various ethnic groups all have the freedom to use and develop their own languages and scripts and the freedom to maintain or reform their own customs."

Second, regarding the amendment to Article 5 of the draft constitution. This article describes the various forms of ownership of the means of production that currently exist in our country. Someone suggested that it should be explicitly stated that the four forms of ownership listed in this article, namely state ownership, cooperative ownership, individual ownership of laborers, and capitalist ownership, are only the main forms of ownership in our country at present, not all forms of ownership. The person who proposed this amendment believes that in addition to the four forms of ownership listed in this article, there are still other forms of ownership in our country. Therefore, if the original text of this article does not add the word "main," it is flawed.

The Constitution Drafting Committee believes that this opinion is in line with the actual situation in our country. According to the actual situation, in some ethnic minority areas in our country, there currently exist feudal ownership, and even more backward forms of ownership than feudal ownership. The fourth paragraph of Article 70 of the draft constitution stipulates: "The autonomous organs of ethnic autonomous areas 'can formulate autonomous regulations and single regulations according to the political, economic, and cultural characteristics of local ethnic groups.'" The "economic characteristics" mentioned here include the issue of various special forms of ownership in some ethnic minority areas. Of course, these forms of ownership account for only a very small proportion in our country's national economy. In addition, in the yet-to-be-liberated Taiwan Province, American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique are currently oppressing and plundering the Taiwanese people, and there, the ownership of foreign imperialists, bureaucratic capitalists, and landlords not only exists but also dominates. The aforementioned forms of ownership are not included in the four forms of ownership listed in Article 5. Therefore, the Constitution Drafting Committee adopted this opinion and added the word "main" to Article 5.

Another amendment to Article 5 is to explicitly state that cooperative ownership is the collective ownership of the laboring masses. This amendment makes the meaning of cooperative ownership clearer.

Third, Articles 8, 9, and 10 of the draft constitution, the first paragraph of each, have been amended. The original text of these paragraphs respectively stipulates that the state protects, according to law, the ownership of the means of production and other property of farmers, handicraftsmen and other individual laborers, and capitalists. The original provisions of the draft constitution and the provisions of Article 11 have overlapping content because Article 11 stipulates "The state protects the legal income, savings, housing, and various living materials of citizens," which includes all citizens and includes the ownership of all property other than the means of production. Now we have amended the first paragraph of Article 8 to read: "The state protects, according to law, the ownership of land and other means of production of farmers"; amended the first paragraph of Article 9 to read: "The state protects, according to law, the ownership of the means of production of handicraftsmen and other non-agricultural individual laborers"; amended the first paragraph of Article 10 to read: "The state protects, according to law, the ownership of the means of production and other capital of capitalists," and the "other capital" in this paragraph refers to the forms of capital of capitalists other than the means of production, such as commercial capital. After such amendments, the overlapping content of the previous and subsequent articles is avoided.

Fourth, the original text of the first paragraph of Article 23 stipulates: "The National People's Congress is composed of representatives elected by provinces, municipalities directly under the Central Government, ethnic minorities, the military, and overseas Chinese," and now it is amended to read: "The National People's Congress is composed of representatives elected by provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, the military, and overseas Chinese." Because when electing representatives to the National People's Congress, ethnic minorities are not a unit of election, only autonomous regions are the same regional election units as provinces and municipalities directly under the Central Government. Therefore, such an amendment should be made.

However, the representatives of various ethnic minorities in the National People's Congress are not only produced by autonomous regions but also more by various provinces and municipalities directly under the Central Government. Therefore, various provinces and municipalities directly under the Central Government must pay attention to ensuring that ethnic minorities have an appropriate number of representatives when electing representatives to the National People's Congress. For this reason, we have also amended the second paragraph of Article 23, and the amended text specially points out that the election law should stipulate the number of representatives of ethnic minorities and the method of their production. In fact, the "Law on the Election of Deputies to the National People's Congress and Local People's Congresses at Various Levels" promulgated by the Central People's Government in March 1953 has already done so.

Fifth, Articles 34 and 35 of the draft constitution have been amended, and these two articles are the provisions on the various committees established by the National People's Congress.

According to the provisions of Article 34, the National People's Congress establishes the Nationalities Committee, the Law Committee, the Budget Committee, the Committee for the Examination of Qualifications of Deputies, and other committees that need to be established. These committees are permanent organizations. Their task is to assist the National People's Congress in its work. According to the work situation, the Nationalities Committee and the Law Committee also assist the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in its work during the recess of the National People's Congress, while the Budget Committee and the Committee for the Examination of Qualifications of Deputies only work during the sessions of the National People's Congress. To indicate the difference in the work situation of these two types of committees, a slight amendment was made to the second paragraph of Article 34, stating: "The Nationalities Committee and the Law Committee, during the recess of the National People's Congress, are under the leadership of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress."

Article 35 stipulates the committees established by the National People's Congress for investigating specific issues. Such committees are temporary organizations, and they are committees established by the National People's Congress to supervise the work of other state organs, so such committees have a different nature from the committees stipulated in Article 34. Because the original text did not clearly stipulate the nature and tasks of such committees, amendments were made. Also, according to the provisions of Article 31 of the draft constitution, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress is responsible for supervising the work of other state organs, and to carry out such supervision, the Standing Committee should also have the right to establish such committees for investigating specific issues. Therefore, the amended Article 35 changed the original "committees established by the National People's Congress" to "the National People's Congress considers it necessary to establish, and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress considers it necessary to establish during the recess of the National People's Congress, committees for investigating specific issues." In this way, the difference between the two types of committees stipulated in Articles 34 and 35 is indicated, and the authority of the Standing Committee to establish such committees is supplemented.

Sixth, the second paragraph of Article 79 was added with the provision "higher people's courts supervise the trial work of lower people's courts." Due to the vast territory and large population of our country, and the fact that transportation in many areas is still very inconvenient, if it is stipulated that only the Supreme People's Court has the right to supervise the trial work of local people's courts and special people's courts, it will not be in line with the actual situation. To facilitate the correction of possible errors in the trial work, the system of higher people's courts supervising the trial work of lower people's courts is implemented. Based on the experience of the work of the courts since the founding of our country and the current conditions of our country, this is relatively appropriate.

Seventh, the Constitution Drafting Committee made relatively large amendments to the provisions of various articles in the draft constitution related to the procuratorial organs, mainly to Articles 81 to 84. From the amended text, it can be seen that the procuratorial organs of our country will be the Supreme People's Procuratorate, local people's procuratorates at various levels, and special people's procuratorates. In addition to the procurator-general, deputy procurator-generals, and procurators, the people's procuratorates also establish procuratorial committees. The procuratorial committee is an organization that handles major issues related to procuratorial work under the leadership of the procurator-general. The establishment of such a deliberative organization within the people's procuratorate can ensure that issues are discussed collectively, making the people's procuratorate more capable of working appropriately. We believe that adopting this system in the procuratorial organs is relatively suitable for the current actual situation in our country.

The above are some relatively important amendments made to the draft constitution after considering the opinions of the people.

I would also like to mention some opinions that, after consideration by the Constitution Drafting Committee, were deemed not to be adopted. Of course, it is not possible to list all these opinions in this report. I will only mention the following few points.

First, some people proposed to describe in detail the revolutionary history of our country in the preamble, such as to explain more about the role of the Communist Party of China in our country's revolutionary history, the role of the worker-peasant alliance, the role of the united front, to explain more about the struggles of revolutionary martyrs over the past hundred years, to explain more about the achievements in various aspects since the founding of the People's Republic of China, etc. This type of opinion was not adopted by the Constitution Drafting Committee.

Some people proposed two opposite opinions about the preamble. One opinion is that the preamble should mention the distant goal of communism, and the other opinion is that the preamble should not mention things that have not yet been realized. These two opinions were also not adopted.

Why were the above opinions not adopted?

It is necessary to state in the preamble of the draft constitution that this constitution is the result of the victory of the Chinese people's revolution. However, the reason why the constitution needs a preamble is more importantly to state in the preamble that our country is in a transitional period and to emphasize the total task of the state in the transitional period and the internal and external conditions for achieving this total task. The entire revolutionary history of the Chinese people should be respected, but if many historical narratives that are not necessary for the constitution are added to the preamble, it is inappropriate.

Because our constitution is a transitional period constitution, it cannot but differ from the constitution of a society that has already built socialism. On the one hand, our country has not yet built a socialist society, and on the other hand, the construction of socialism already exists in our real life and is developing day by day. The constitution does not describe the situation after socialism is fully built, but to reflect the current real situation, it must reflect the changes that are actually taking place in life and the goals that these changes are heading towards. If this goal is not indicated, many things in real life will be incomprehensible. Our constitution has some provisions that are programmatic precisely for this reason.

From this, it can be seen that it is wrong to think that because the construction of socialism has not been completed, the goal of building a socialist society should not be proposed in the preamble. However, it is also unnecessary to think that in the preamble, not only should the goal of building a socialist society be proposed, but also the distant goal of building a communist society, that is, the goal of striving for communism, should be mentioned.

Second, some people proposed that when listing the various forms of ownership of the means of production in our country in Article 5, state capitalism should also be mentioned. The Constitution Drafting Committee did not adopt this opinion. Because at present, in our country, state capitalism has various different forms, that is, economic alliances between state ownership and capitalist ownership in various complex forms, and cannot be a unique form of ownership. Therefore, in pointing out various forms of ownership in Article 5, state capitalism should not be listed.

Third, some people proposed to specifically list the names of various ministries and commissions under the State Council in the third section of Chapter II of the draft constitution. The Constitution Drafting Committee did not adopt this opinion. Because with the development of our country's state construction work, the organizational structure of the State Council will inevitably have some changes in certain situations, so the names of various departments under the State Council are not specifically listed in this section to avoid the need to amend the constitution whenever there is a change. The names of various ministries and commissions of the State Council can be separately stipulated in the State Council's organizational law.

Fourth, some people proposed an amendment regarding local state organs. This opinion believes that local people's congresses at all levels should also establish standing committees like the National People's Congress. The Constitution Drafting Committee did not adopt this opinion.

The work of the National People's Congress is much heavier than that of local people's congresses at all levels. The National People's Congress exercises the legislative power of the state, and local people's congresses at all levels do not have this power. Moreover, the lower the level of the people's congress, the smaller the area, the easier it is to convene meetings. Therefore, local people's congresses at all levels do not need to establish permanent organs outside the people's committees. Local people's committees at all levels are the executive organs of local people's congresses at all levels and at the same time exercise the powers of the permanent organs of the people's congresses. If another permanent organ of the people's congress is established, it will only cause organizational duplication and inconvenience.

Fifth, some people proposed to add provisions in the preamble of the constitution regarding the status and tasks of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The Constitution Drafting Committee believes that it is not necessary to make such provisions in the preamble of the constitution.

The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is the organizational form of the united front of the people of our country. It once exercised the functions of the National People's Congress, and these functions, of course, are no longer needed to be exercised by it, but it will continue to play its role in the political life of our country as an organizational form of the united front. Since it is an organizational form of the united front, the various parties and organizations that participate in the united front will, through consultation, make various provisions regarding this organization on their own.

Sixth, some people proposed to add provisions in the constitution regarding the territory of our country. The Constitution Drafting Committee believes that it is not necessary to add such provisions in the constitution. The basic task of the constitution is to stipulate the social system and state system in the form of law, and describing the specific territory of the state is not its necessary task. In the constitution of a federal state, it is necessary to list the various units in the federation, but our country is not such a state. In a unitary state, if it is considered necessary to fix the current administrative division, it is also possible to list various administrative units in the constitution. However, at present, the economic construction of our country has just begun, and the administrative division within the country has not yet been completely fixed. For example, not long ago, the Central People's Government Committee decided to merge several provincial administrative units. Therefore, it is not appropriate to list the names of various administrative units according to the current situation in the constitution. Of course, the administrative division is not to be changed lightly, so the draft constitution stipulates that only the National People's Congress has the power to approve the division of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government, and the division of autonomous prefectures, counties, autonomous counties, and cities is to be approved by the State Council.

People proposed to add provisions regarding the territory, with the intention of affirming in the constitution that Taiwan is an inseparable part of our country's territory, which is a good intention. However, the constitution does not need to add new provisions for this purpose, because Taiwan is the sacred territory of China, which has never been in doubt. To liberate Taiwan from the rule of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and achieve the complete unification of our country is a task that the Chinese people must accomplish.

The above is a brief response to the various opinions raised by the people regarding the draft constitution.

Fourth, conclusion

Comrades! In the nationwide discussion, it has been proven that our draft constitution represents the interests of the people of all ethnic groups in the country and is practical. When the people discussed the draft constitution, they said: "The draft constitution has written down many things that the people of China have done under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao; it has also written down the things that have already begun to do and should be done and can be done in the future." "It has clearly stated how we should go to socialism, item by item." "The draft constitution signifies that the political, economic, and cultural construction of various ethnic minorities will have greater development." The broad masses believe that the constitution we drafted is a "guarantee of a happy life" and believe that "every article of the draft constitution represents the interests of the people." This is the conclusion that the people have made about the draft constitution, and obviously, this conclusion is correct.

Our draft constitution, after being adopted by the National People's Congress, will become the fundamental law of our country. Since this constitution expresses the personal experience and long-term aspirations of the people, it will definitely play a great and positive role in the national life of our country, definitely inspire the people to struggle to defend and develop our achievements, to struggle to smash all enemies who attempt to sabotage our social system and state system, and to struggle to promote the healthy development of our construction cause and accelerate the pace of our construction. The constitution is something that all the people and all state organs must abide by. The representatives of the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels, as well as all personnel of state organs, are servants of the people, and all state organs are organs that serve the people. Therefore, they have a special responsibility in abiding by the constitution and ensuring its implementation.

The Communist Party of China is the leading core of our country. The status of the party does not allow party members to enjoy any special rights in national life, but only makes them bear greater responsibilities. Members of the Communist Party of China must play a model role in abiding by the constitution and all other laws. All communists must closely connect with the masses, unite with various democratic parties, and unite with the broad masses outside the party to actively work for the implementation of the constitution.

The promulgation of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China will not only make the people of the entire country rejoice, but will also make our friends in all countries of the world happy. The people's China has many friends in the international community. The great Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries are our close friends, and all peace-loving people in the world are our friends. The support of our friends for our cause is one of the main conditions for our victory. It is understandable that our friends are happy about our victory. The victory of the Chinese revolution has great world historical significance, and the victory of Chinese socialist construction and socialist transformation also has great world historical significance. Our constitution has already stipulated the fundamental policy of our country in international affairs, and this policy is to strive for the lofty purpose of world peace and human progress. All the achievements we have made and will make are conducive to the common cause of peace and progress of all the people of the world. Striving for lasting world peace is a necessary condition for our socialist construction.

The promulgation of our country's constitution is a great achievement of the long-term joint struggle of all ethnic groups in our country, but this does not mean that after the promulgation of the constitution, any provision of the constitution will be naturally realized. No, the constitution, on the one hand, summarizes our past struggles, and on the other hand, provides a fundamental legal basis for our current struggles. It stipulates in our national life the most important issues of what is legal or legally mandatory to be executed, and what is illegal and must be prohibited. After the promulgation of the constitution, phenomena that violate the provisions of the constitution will not disappear on their own, but the constitution provides us with a powerful weapon to effectively struggle against these phenomena. The constitution stipulates that our country will build a socialist society, which of course does not mean that a socialist society is already a ready-made thing, nor does it mean that we can sit and wait for it to come. We still have a long way to go ahead, and on this road, there will inevitably be difficulties and twists and turns, and it will absolutely not be smooth sailing. The significance of the constitution is great, and the task given to us by the constitution is even greater. We can only achieve our goal through arduous struggle and tenacious work, through unremitting efforts to learn, and overcome all kinds of difficulties in front of us. We must not be complacent and self-satisfied because of the achievements we have already made. Complacency and self-satisfaction are harmful and of no benefit to any individual, any class, any party, or any nation. When we celebrate the formulation and promulgation of the constitution, all ethnic groups in our country must, according to the path stipulated by the constitution, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, strengthen unity, continue to strive, and struggle to ensure the full implementation of the constitution and struggle to build our country into a great socialist country.

    关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告
    （一九五四年九月十五日在中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上的报告）
    刘少奇各位代表！
    制定中华人民共和国宪法，在我国国家生活中，是一件具有重大历史意义的事情。我国的第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的首要任务，就是制定我国的宪法。
    现在提交大会的宪法草案，是经过了郑重的起草工作而完成的。
    中央人民政府委员会在一九五三年一月十三日成立了以毛泽东同志为首的中华人民共和国宪法起草委员会。宪法起草委员会在一九五四年三月接受了中国共产党中央委员会提出的宪法草案初稿，随即在北京和全国各大城市组织各民主党派、各人民团体和社会各方面的代表人物共八千多人，用两个多月的时间，对这个初稿进行了认真的讨论。应当说，这八千多人都是宪法起草工作的参加者。以这个初稿为基础经过修改后的宪法草案，由中央人民政府委员会在一九五四年六月十四日公布，交付全国人民讨论。全国人民的讨论进行了两个多月，共有一亿五千多万人参加。广大的人民群众热烈地拥护这个宪法草案，同时提出了很多修改和补充的意见。根据这些意见，宪法起草委员会对原来的草案再度作了修改，并且经过一九五四年九月九日中央人民政府委员会第三十四次会议讨论通过，这才产生了现在提交大会的这个草案。
    现在，我代表中华人民共和国宪法起草委员会向大会作关于宪法草案的报告。
    一、中华人民共和国宪法草案是历史经验的总结
    我们制定宪法是以事实做根据的。我们所根据的事实是什么呢？这就是我国人民已经在反对帝国主义、反对封建主义和反对官僚资本主义的长期革命斗争中取得了彻底胜利的事实，就是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家已经巩固地建立起来了的事实，就是我国已经建立起社会主义经济的强有力的领导地位、开始有系统地进行社会主义改造、正在一步一步地过渡到社会主义社会去的事实。
    从这些事实出发，我们制定的宪法当然只能是人民民主的宪法。这是属于社会主义类型的宪法，而不是属于资产阶级类型的宪法。
    我们提出的宪法草案，是中国人民一百多年以来英勇斗争的历史经验的总结，也是中国近代关于宪法问题和宪政运动的历史经验的总结。
    中国人民曾经长期生活在帝国主义和封建主义的黑暗统治下面。一百多年以前，外国资本主义开始侵略中国，暴露了当时中国的封建皇朝完全没有能力保卫自己的国家。外来的侵略和压迫愈来愈厉害，国内的政治也愈来愈黑暗。从那个时候起，中国这样一个大国，在对外关系上实际丧失了独立国家的地位，广大人民过着非常痛苦的日子。但是，就在那个时候，中国人民开始进行了英勇的反对外国资本主义和本国封建主义的革命斗争。许多的先进人物，为了救中国，为了改变自己国家的命运，努力去寻找真理。他们努力学习西方资产阶级的政治和文化，以为西方资产阶级的那些东西很可以救中国。他们在学了这些东西以后，就企图按照西方资产阶级国家的模型来改变中国的国家制度和社会制度。
    六十年以前，以康有为为首的改良派的变法运动，就是这种企图的一次尝试。他们希望使中国有一个不要根本改变封建制度而可以发展资本主义的宪法。他们的主张在当时受到了许多人的赞成和拥护。他们虽然是改良派，但在当时的条件下，他们的变法运动还是有进步意义的，因此引起了反动派的仇视。他们的活动，在一八九八年受到以慈禧太后为首的反动派的镇压而失败了。
      康有为一派人的变法运动失败了，中国人民仍然坚持地进行反对帝国主义和封建主义的斗争。在清朝末年，出现了以孙中山为首的革命派。这一派和改良派不同，他们抱着建立资产阶级民主共和国的理想而进行推翻清朝统治的革命斗争，这就比改良派大进了一步。
    清朝的统治，在革命势力迅速发展的情势下，已经不能维持下去。为了维持自己的统治，为了欺骗人民和抵制人民的革命，在将近五十年前，清朝统治者宣布了“预备立宪”，并且公布了一个“宪法大纲”。这个“宪法大纲”的主要目的是要保存封建专制制度，虽然在表面上不能不许诺人民一些要求，但是人民不相信这种许诺是真的，不相信这种“立宪”能使中国进步。人民抵制了这种骗人的“立宪”。这个时候，对于这种“立宪”，以孙中山为首的革命派采取了坚决反对的立场，而以康有为为首的改良派采取了拥护的立场。因此，改良派也受到了革命派的反对，并为人民所抛弃。
    以孙中山为首的革命派，坚决主张经过革命来实现他们所期望的民主宪政，也就是资产阶级性质的民主宪政。就当时的历史条件来说，他们这样做是正确的，他们代表了广大人民群众的要求。在他们的领导下，终于爆发了具有伟大历史意义的辛亥革命。
    辛亥革命推翻了清朝的统治，结束了中国两千多年来的封建帝制，产生了中华民国和以孙中山为首的革命的南京临时政府，并产生了一个临时约法。这个临时约法具有资产阶级共和国宪法的性质，是有进步意义的。辛亥革命使民主共和国的观念从此深入人心，使人们公认，任何违反这个观念的言论和行动都是非法的。但是当时的革命派是有缺点的。他们没有一个彻底的反对帝国主义和封建主义的纲领，没有广泛地发动和组织可以依靠的人民大众的力量，因此他们不能取得对于帝国主义和封建主义的彻底胜利。这次革命终于失败了，袁世凯领导的反动派篡夺了国家权力。从此中国就进入各派北洋军阀统治的时期，临时约法被撕毁，“中华民国”变为名不副实的空招牌。孙中山领导的革命派进行了反对北洋军阀政府的斗争，但是没有得到成功。
    在北洋军阀的统治下，中国的状况越来越坏。世界上所有主要帝国主义国家都在中国进行争夺，它们支持中国的各派军阀连年不断地进行内战，使中国陷入极端混乱的局面。一个军阀接着一个军阀掌握当时的北京政权。北洋军阀中最后一个所谓大总统曹锟，为了继续维持军阀的统治，在一九二三年公布了一个骗人的“宪法”。这个“宪法”也立即为当时的人民所否认，孙中山领导的国民党和中国共产党都反对了这个“宪法”，认为是伪宪。这个伪宪公布以后只有一年，曹锟的政府就垮台了。
    在辛亥革命以前和辛亥革命以后的若干年间，中国一切有志救国的人还只能按照资本主义的方向去寻找中国的出路。到了第一次世界大战和俄国十月社会主义革命以后，中国人开始看到了西方资本主义的日趋没落，并且看到了社会主义的万丈光芒。一九一九年五月四日，中国发生了伟大的反对帝国主义和封建主义的革命运动。在这个时候，中国工人运动开始高涨起来。中国人民中的先进分子开始确信，能够解决中国问题的不是资本主义的道路，而是社会主义的道路。
    先进分子的这种正确的信念，很快地变成了广大群众的信念。一九二一年，中国建立了马克思列宁主义的工人阶级的政党——中国共产党，从此就开辟了中国革命的新局面，使中国革命成为工人阶级领导的人民民主革命，即新民主主义革命，成为世界社会主义革命的一部分，并且得到社会主义的苏联的援助。
    在这个时候，伟大的革命家孙中山，从多年奋斗的经验中，认识了要达到救国的目的，“必须唤起民众，及联合世界上以平等待我之民族共同奋斗”。他终于勇敢地采取了联苏、联共、扶助工农的三大政策，同中国共产党建立了反帝反封建的联盟，展开了新的革命斗争。
    一九二七年，中国国民党和中国共产党联合进行的北伐革命战争正在走向胜利的时候，蒋介石国民党背叛了孙中山的政策，背叛了革命。从此以后，中国革命的领导责任就完全由中国工人阶级和它的政党中国共产党单独担负起来了。从此，中国革命所表现的深刻性、彻底性和广大的群众规模，为以前一切革命运动所完全不能比拟。中国人民经过土地革命战争、抗日战争和人民解放战争，逐步地创造了坚强的人民革命军队和广大的革命根据地，并在革命根据地里面建立了统一战线的人民民主政权，进行了各种社会改革，得到了丰富的革命经验。长期的革命斗争证明，中国共产党指出的由新民主主义到社会主义的道路是唯一能够救中国的道路。这条道路在全国人民中树立了极高的信仰。在第二次世界大战结束以后，中国人民终于战胜了美国帝国主义支持的蒋介石反动派，在一九四九年取得了人民革命的伟大胜利。
    在过去相继统治中国的几个反动政府中，蒋介石国民党政府是最后的一个反动政府，它是从来不要宪法的。但当它垂死的时候，也想用一个伪宪来救自己的命。这个伪宪受到中国共产党、中国各民主党派和全国人民的坚决反对，结果和过去的反动政府一样，在蒋介石公布他的伪宪以后不到三年的时间，他的统治就彻底垮台了。同时，拥护这个伪宪的中国青年党、国家社会党等反革命党派也受到了人民的唾弃。这件事，在座的各位代表都是清楚地记得的。
    一百多年以来，中国革命同反革命的激烈的斗争没有停止过。这种激烈的斗争反映在国家制度的问题上，就表现为三种不同的势力所要求的三种不同的宪法。
    第一，就是从清朝、北洋军阀、一直到蒋介石国民党所制造的伪宪。这些封建买办阶级的反动统治者是连资产阶级民主也反对的。他们本来不要任何宪法，所以总是要拖到他们的反动统治在革命力量的打击下摇摇欲坠，他们的末日已经临近的时候，才制造一种骗人的“宪法”，其目的是想利用一些资产阶级宪法的形式装点门面，使他们的反动统治能够苟延残喘。他们的这种目的，当然不可能达到。
    第二，就是中国民族资产阶级在以往多年所盼望的宪法，也就是资产阶级民主共和国的宪法。这种宪法，除了辛亥革命所产生而随即被袁世凯撕毁了的那个临时约法以外，中国从来没有产生过。
    世界上有过许多民族，在脱离封建主义之后，建立了资产阶级的共和国。但是这种资产阶级共和国，在半殖民地半封建的中国，始终只是一种幻想。中国资产阶级既然没有能力领导人民战胜外国帝国主义和本国反动派的联合力量，它就不可能使中国变为资产阶级共和国，也就不可能使中国出现资产阶级性质的宪法。
    第三，就是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民共和国的宪法，这就是现在我们所要制定的宪法。
    毛泽东同志早已指出：在工人阶级领导的人民革命胜利以后，不会建立资产阶级专政的共和国，而一定要建立工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的共和国。这个以工人阶级为领导的人民共和国只会把中国引向社会主义，而不会把中国引向资本主义。
    事情就是这样：封建买办阶级的反动统治者几次用来骗人的伪宪，都不能使人民上当，都受到人民的抵制。而参与制造和积极拥护这种伪宪的人们，也被人民所抛弃。果然，几批反动统治者都接着伪宪的宣布迅速垮台，而这些所谓“宪法”都变成了废纸。同时，几十年来，在中国虽然有过不少的人为实现资产阶级的宪政做过各种各样的努力，但是一点成就也没有。在中国出现的真正的宪法，毕竟只能是人民民主主义和社会主义的宪法，只有这种宪法，才是适合于最广大人民群众的利益，而为最广大人民群众所欢迎的。
    所以我们说，我们现在提出的宪法草案乃是对于一百多年以来中国人民革命斗争的历史经验的总结，也是对于中国近代关于宪法问题的历史经验的总结。
    当然，我们的宪法草案又是中华人民共和国成立以来新的历史经验的总结。
      一九四九年，中国人民政治协商会议制定了一个共同纲领。这个共同纲领起了临时宪法的作用。这个共同纲领总结了过去革命的经验，特别是人民革命根据地的经验，宣告了中华人民共和国的成立，确定了中华人民共和国应当实现的各方面的基本政策。这个共同纲领，中央人民政府和地方各级人民政府坚决地执行了。
    从中华人民共和国成立以来，虽然只有五年的时间，我们国家的变化却是巨大的。
    第一，我国已经结束了在外国帝国主义统治下的殖民地和附属国的地位，成了一个真正独立的国家。毛泽东同志在一九四九年九月中国人民政治协商会议开幕的时候，庄严地宣告：“占人类总数四分之一的中国人从此站立起来了。”一百多年以来，中国人民作了无数的牺牲，以求摆脱外国帝国主义的统治，这个目的已经达到了。从一九五○年起在全国范围内发动的伟大的抗美援朝运动，继续加强了我国的独立地位。我国已经以世界大国的身份出现在国际舞台上。我国已经同苏联和各人民民主国家一起，成为保卫世界和平的坚强堡垒。
    第二，我国已经结束了年代久远的封建主义的统治。封建主义的剥削制度曾经是我国停滞不振、落后和被欺侮的根源，这种根源已经由全国规模的群众运动在我国绝大多数地区内完全消灭了。
    第三，我国已经结束了长期的混乱局面，实现了国内和平，造成了我国全部大陆空前统一的局面。我国各民族之间已经结束了过去那种互相歧视和互不信任的情况，而在反对帝国主义和反对各民族内部的人民公敌的基础上，在民族平等和友爱互助的基础上，亲密地团结起来了。
    第四，我国已经在极广泛的范围内结束了人民无权的状况，发扬了高度的民主主义。经过土地改革及其他社会改革，经过镇压反革命和抗美援朝等广大的群众运动，人民群众已经组织起来。无数平日对国事漠不关心的人，也积极地起来参加国家的政治生活了。全国广大人民群众已经深切地体验到，人民代表大会是管理自己国家的最好的政治组织形式。
    第五，由于解放后的人民在劳动战线上表现出惊人的热情和创造能力，加上我们的伟大盟国苏联的援助，我国已经在很短的时间内，恢复了被帝国主义和国民党反动派所破坏了的国民经济，开始了社会主义建设和社会主义改造的事业。社会主义经济在实际生活中，已经无可怀疑地证明了它比资本主义经济具有极大的优越性，它已日益壮大，并且日益巩固自己在国民经济中的领导地位。我们的国家关于社会主义事业所采取的具体步骤和具体措施，得到了广大人民群众的拥护。从一九五三年起，我国已经按照建设社会主义的目标，实行了发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，并且已经获得了成就。
    这一系列的情况，说明了我们的国家五年以来已经大踏步地前进了，说明了国家权力一旦掌握在有组织有领导的人民手里，便能发挥无敌的力量，使人民从悲惨的生活中解放出来，使我们的国家有飞跃的进步，使人民的物质生活和文化生活得到改善。这一系列的情况，也说明了我们的国家和政府为什么会这样得到全体人民的支持和信任，并得到全世界爱好和平的人民的同情和支持。
    我国近代历史中，人们曾经长期争论过的一个根本问题——中国的出路是什么，是资本主义呢，还是社会主义？对于这一个问题，五年以来我国发生的巨大变化已经作了生动的解答。五年以来的生活充分证明，由目前复杂的经济结构的社会过渡到单一的社会主义经济结构的社会，即由目前的新民主主义社会过渡到社会主义社会，是我国应当走的唯一正确的道路。
    现在来看，中国是不是还有什么其他的路可走呢？
    美国帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团向我们说：我国应当回到殖民地和封建统治的老路上去。据说我国人民正处在“黑暗生活”中，他们应当来“解放”我们，中华人民共和国应当推翻，他们的反动统治应当复辟，那就是说，我国人民应当再回到帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的血腥统治下面去。大家知道，经过一百多年的斗争才得到了解放的全国人民是决不会允许我国再退回到这条悲惨的老路上去的。但是美国帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团以及大陆上的特务反革命分子，却坚持要使我国走这条老路。现在美国帝国主义还侵占着台湾，蒋介石卖国集团还盘踞在台湾继续作恶，并且时刻企图回到大陆上来。反动派的复辟仍然是一个实际的危险。如果有人看轻这种危险，那就要犯错误。因此，全国人民必须经常保持高度的警惕性，必须努力加强我们的国防力量，并为解放台湾，彻底消灭蒋介石卖国集团而进行坚决的斗争。
    我国是否还可以走资本主义道路，发展资本主义，变成资本主义国家呢？或许还有一些落后分子作这种幻想，但这是一种很错误而且很危险的幻想。毛泽东同志说过，“资产阶级的共和国，外国有过的，中国不能有”。在工人阶级领导下的今天的我国人民，决不会容许资本主义在我国泛滥，更决不会容许把工人阶级领导的人民民主专政变为资产阶级专政。世界资本主义已经没落，世界上所有资本主义最发达的国家都已走到了绝路，而社会主义的苏联和其他人民民主国家已经繁荣强大起来。我国人民在工人阶级领导下正在建设社会主义，国家的面貌正在改变，人民的物质生活和文化生活正在逐步提高。在这样的国际国内的局势下，中国人民难道会愿意抛弃自己社会主义的光明幸福的前途，而走到资本主义的苦痛的道路上去吗？当然是不会的。所以，凡有这种幻想的人必须迅速抛弃这种幻想。如果还有人不愿抛弃并且坚持这种幻想的话，那他们就有可能走到帝国主义所指引的危险的道路上去。因为他们既然坚持要使中国走资本主义的道路，就势必要同帝国主义国家联系起来，而帝国主义者却不会让中国成为独立的资本主义的国家，只会使中国成为帝国主义和封建买办阶级统治的殖民地。这正是蒋介石卖国贼所走的道路。
    我国是否还有什么别的道路可走呢？或许有人想到一条维持现状的道路，即既不是资本主义的道路，也不是社会主义的道路，而是既有社会主义，又有资本主义，将我们现在所处的状态维持下去。大家知道，我国正处在建设社会主义社会的过渡时期。在我国，这个时期也叫做新民主主义时期，这个时期在经济上的特点，就是既有社会主义，又有资本主义。有一些人希望永远保存这种状态，最好不要改变。他们说：有了共同纲领就够了，何必还要宪法呢？最近几年，我们还常常听见“巩固新民主主义秩序”这样一种说法，这种说法就是反映了维持现状的思想。这究竟是否可能呢？社会主义和资本主义两种相反的生产关系，在一个国家里面互不干扰地平行发展，是不可能的。中国不变成社会主义国家，就要变成资本主义国家，要它不变，就是要使事物停止不动，这是绝对不可能的。要变成资本主义国家，我在前面已经说过，此路不通。所以我国只有社会主义这条唯一的光明大道可走，而且不能不走，因为这是我国历史发展的必然规律。
    由此可见，我国走社会主义的道路，是确定不移的。除此以外，没有其他的路可走。
    从中华人民共和国成立以后，我国已经走上了社会主义的道路。宪法草案序言中说：“从中华人民共和国成立到社会主义社会建成，这是一个过渡时期。国家在过渡时期的总任务是逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，逐步完成对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。”从一九五三年起，我国已经按照社会主义的目标进入有计划的经济建设时期，因此，我们有完全的必要在共同纲领的基础上前进一步，制定一个像现在向各位代表提出的这样的宪法，用法律的形式把我国过渡时期的总任务肯定下来。
    在我国实现社会主义工业化和社会主义改造，是一个十分艰巨复杂的任务。必须动员全国人民的力量，发挥广大人民群众的积极性和创造性，在正确的和高度统一的领导之下，克服各种困难，才能实现这样的任务。因此，一方面，我们必须更加发扬人民的民主，扩大我们国家民主制度的规模；另一方面，我们必须建立高度统一的国家领导制度。为了这样的目的，我们也有完全的必要制定一个比共同纲领更为完备的像现在向各位代表提出的这样的宪法。
    全国人民在讨论中热烈地称赞我们的宪法草案，因为这个宪法草案正确地总结了我国的历史经验。这个宪法草案是我国人民利益和人民意志的产物，是我们国家发生了巨大变化的产物。
    人民称赞这个宪法草案，还因为它正确地吸收了国际的经验。宪法起草委员会在从事起草工作的时候，参考了苏联的先后几个宪法和各人民民主国家的宪法。显然，以苏联为首的社会主义先进国家的经验，对我们有很大的帮助。我们的宪法草案结合了中国的经验和国际的经验。我们的宪法草案不只是我国人民革命运动的产物，而且是国际社会主义运动的一个产物。
    以上是关于我国宪法的历史意义的说明。
    二、关于宪法草案基本内容的若干说明
    现在，我对宪法草案的基本内容分为以下四个问题作一些说明。
    第一、关于我们国家的性质问题宪法草案第一条规定：“中华人民共和国是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家。”宪法草案在序言和其他许多条文的规定中都表明，在我国的人民民主制度下，还存在着广泛的人民民主统一战线。
    只有依靠工人阶级的领导，我国人民才能从帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的压迫下获得解放，这个真理早已由过去长期的历史事实证明了。在人民获得胜利以后，出现了新的问题：工人阶级领导国家建设是不是也和过去一样有本领和有把握呢？对于这一点，如果有些人在开始的时候采取了等等看的态度，那么，五年以来的事实已经充分证明了工人阶级领导国家的非凡的才能。为着巩固我国人民已经取得的胜利果实，必须继续巩固和加强工人阶级对于国家的领导。我们的社会主义建设和社会主义改造的事业，离开工人阶级对于国家的领导，是不能设想的。
    不断地巩固和加强工农联盟，是工人阶级的领导能够得到胜利的基本保证。这在我国过去的革命战争中和现在的国家建设中都是一样的。在反对帝国主义和封建主义的革命战争中锻炼出来的我国的工农联盟，到了中华人民共和国成立以后，不是削弱了，而是更加加强了。在逐步过渡到社会主义社会的过程中，农民是要起变化的，这种变化现在已经开始了，这就是从经济生活不稳定的个体农民逐步变化为社会主义的合作化的农民。只有由工人阶级领导农民走合作化的道路，才能不断地改善农民的生活情况，才能使工农联盟更加密切和更加巩固。
    在劳动人民中，除工人农民外，我国还有为数不少的城市和乡村的个体手工业者和其他非农业的个体劳动者，他们是依靠劳动过活的，或者是主要地依靠劳动过活的。工人阶级必须如同团结农民一样，很好地团结这些劳动人民共同建设社会主义。团结这些劳动人民，是属于工农联盟的范畴之内的。
    工人阶级领导和以工农联盟为基础，标志着我们国家的根本性质。这就表明我们的国家是人民民主国家。人民民主国家和资本主义国家在性质上是完全不同的两类国家。在资本主义国家里，无论怎样标榜“民主”，终究只是占人口中极少数的资产阶级居于国家的统治地位。在我们这里，最大多数的人民才真正是国家的主人。
    我国的知识分子，在过去的革命运动中起了很重要的作用，在今后建设社会主义的事业中将起更加重要的作用。知识分子从各种不同的社会阶级出身，他们本身不能单独构成一个独立的社会阶级。他们可以同劳动人民结合而成为劳动人民的知识分子，也可以同资产阶级结合而成为资产阶级的知识分子，还有极少数的知识分子同被推翻了的封建买办阶级结合而成为反动的知识分子。除开极少数坚持反动立场并进行反对中华人民共和国活动的知识分子以外，我们的国家必须注意团结一切知识分子，帮助他们进行思想改造，发挥他们的能力，使他们为社会主义的建设事业服务。毛泽东同志早已说过：“一切知识分子，只要是在为人民服务的工作中著有成绩的，应当受到尊重，把他们看作国家和社会的宝贵的财富。”
    宪法草案序言说：“今后在动员和团结全国人民完成国家过渡时期总任务和反对内外敌人的斗争中，我国的人民民主统一战线将继续发挥它的作用。”这就表明，在我国过渡时期，工人阶级领导的包括各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体的人民民主统一战线具有重要的作用。这是以工农联盟为基础而又较工农联盟更为广泛的联盟，即劳动人民同可以合作的非劳动人民之间的一种联盟。有人以为既然要建设社会主义，这种联盟就不可能存在，也没有存在的必要，这种看法是错误的。
    我国在过渡时期还有民族资产阶级。人们知道，在社会上有剥削阶级和被剥削阶级存在的时候，阶级斗争总是存在的。但我国原来是被外国帝国主义压迫的国家，由于我国这样的特殊历史条件，工人阶级和民族资产阶级之间就不但有斗争，还曾经有过并且现在还存在着联盟的关系。民族资产阶级过去曾经在工人阶级领导下参加了民族民主革命，五年以来又在国家领导下参加了爱国运动和经济恢复的工作。经过“三反”“五反”的严重斗争，许多资本家提高了觉悟，他们表示愿意接受社会主义改造。这样，我们的国家对资本主义工商业就有可能采取逐步进行社会主义改造的政策，并且正在进行这种改造。在过渡时期，民族资产阶级在国民经济中还有重要的作用。他们在扩大生产、接受社会主义改造、改进企业管理和生产技术、培养和训练技术工人和技术人员等方面，对国家还可以作出一定的贡献。在过渡时期，民族资产阶级在政治上也有一定的地位。
    在我国社会中，特别在各少数民族中，还有属于其他阶级成份的爱国的人士，国家也要很好地团结他们。
    由此可见，我国现在的统一战线仍然具有广泛的基础。
    中国共产党早已指出，在工人阶级领导下的全国人民的革命大团结，不只是对于我国人民民主革命是需要的，对于实现社会主义事业也同样是需要的。因为在我们面前还站着帝国主义。同时，在我国给人们选择的道路，实际上只有两条，或者是重新受帝国主义的奴役，或者是实现社会主义。中国要独立、民主和富强，只有走社会主义一条路。在这种情况下，凡是不愿意做殖民地奴隶的爱国的人们，就有在工人阶级领导下团结起来接受社会主义道路的可能。在继续巩固工人阶级领导和工农联盟的前提下，在可能的范围内，人民中间的团结越广，对于社会主义事业就越有好处。所以，我们的宪法应当是一个全国人民大团结建设社会主义社会的宪法。
    第二、关于过渡到社会主义社会的步骤问题
    宪法草案第四条规定：“中华人民共和国依靠国家机关和社会力量，通过社会主义工业化和社会主义改造，保证逐步消灭剥削制度，建立社会主义社会。”
    为了贯彻第四条规定的方针，宪法草案在总纲的其他一些条文中又作了许多规定。这些规定既表明了建设社会主义社会这一个总目标，也表明了建设社会主义社会的具体步骤。
    我国在过渡时期还有多种经济成份。就目前来说，我国的生产资料所有制，主要的有：国家所有制，即全民所有制；合作社所有制，即劳动群众集体所有制；个体劳动者所有制；资本家所有制。国家的任务是尽力巩固和发展前两种所有制的经济成份，即社会主义的经济成份，所以国家要“保证优先发展国营经济”，特别要注意逐步建立社会主义主要经济基础的重工业，同时要“鼓励、指导和帮助合作社经济的发展”。
    宪法草案的这些规定当然不是空想出来的，而是以中华人民共和国成立以来社会经济关系的变化和广大群众的经验为根据的，因此都是行得通的。关于这些规定，我想说一说以下几个问题。
    首先，是关于过渡形式的问题。我们知道，实现对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，是一种很艰巨的任务。我们决不可能在一朝一夕完成这种改造。我们必须根据群众的经验和觉悟程度，根据实际的可能性，逐步前进。我们的经验已经证明，不论在农业、手工业或者资本主义工商业的社会主义改造过程中，都可以有过渡的形式，而采用灵活的多样的过渡形式又是完全必要的。
    在对农业和手工业的社会主义改造中，主要的过渡形式是劳动群众部分集体所有制的合作社，如像几年来我国农村中已经开始发展起来的以土地入股和统一经营为特点的农业生产合作社。在我国的历史条件下，我们逐步地和广泛地运用这种半社会主义性质的合作经济的过渡形式，就可以引导广大的个体劳动者比较顺利地走向劳动群众的集体所有制。
    在对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造中，过渡形式是国家资本主义。在我国的历史条件下，我们可能通过各种不同形式的国家资本主义逐步实现对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。在以工人阶级为领导的国家管理下的国家资本主义，和资产阶级统治下的国家资本主义具有根本不同的性质。这就是列宁所说的“我们能够加以限制、我们能够规定它的界限的一种资本主义”。在国家资本主义经济中，一方面，资本家的所有制还没有废除，资本家还是有利可得，另一方面，资本家已经不能为所欲为地唯利是图。经过国家资本主义这种过渡形式，就可以为将来用全民所有制代替资本家所有制造成有利的条件。
    宪法草案把这些过渡形式明确地规定下来，对于我国的社会主义改造事业是有重要意义的。
    其次，我要说一下通过和平道路来建成社会主义社会的问题。在人民的讨论中有不少的人问：为什么宪法草案序言中说我国的人民民主制度能够保证我国通过和平的道路来消灭剥削，建成社会主义社会呢？
    在我国，封建主义的剥削制度，除少数地方外，已经在革命战争和土地改革的过程中完全消灭了。为要建成社会主义社会，还要消灭资本主义的剥削制度。这是进一步的社会变革。在资本主义国家中，工人阶级和其他劳动群众要实行这种社会变革，必须经过推翻资产阶级专政的国家制度的革命。但是，我国现在的政治经济状况，是同资本主义国家完全不同的。我国已经建立了工人阶级领导的人民民主的国家制度。我国已经有了日益强大的社会主义的国营经济，这种国营经济已经成为整个国民经济的领导力量，而资本主义经济在我国已经不占统治地位。因此，我国的社会主义革命也就同资本主义国家不相同。在我国，不存在推翻资产阶级的国家制度这样的问题，我们可以依靠现在这样的国家机关和社会力量来逐步地进行社会主义改造。同时，如前面所说，在我们国家内，工人阶级同民族资产阶级存在着联盟的关系，因此，在我国消灭资本主义的剥削制度，也可以不采取像一九五○年到一九五二年实现土地改革那样的方式，即在一个短时间内发动一次广大的群众运动，一下子就把封建的土地制度消灭了。国家对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，将经过一个相当长的时间，并通过各种不同形式的国家资本主义来逐步实现。我们将让资本家们有一个必要的时间在国家和工人阶级的领导下逐步接受改造。当然，斗争是一定会有的，现在有，将来还会有。现在就有一部分资本家进行各种违法活动，有一些人并对社会主义改造采取抵抗态度。所以宪法草案规定：“国家禁止资本家的危害公共利益、扰乱社会经济秩序、破坏国家经济计划的一切非法行为。”那种认为我国已经没有阶级斗争了的想法，是完全错误的。对于那些违法和进行破坏活动的资本家，是应当加以处罚的。由限制资本主义剥削到消灭资本主义剥削，不可能设想没有复杂的斗争，但是可以通过国家行政机关的管理、国营经济的领导和工人群众的监督，用和平的斗争方式来达到目的。资本家只要明白了大势所趋，愿意接受社会主义改造，不违法，不破坏人民的财产，那么，他将得到国家的照顾，将来的生活和工作将得到适当的安排，他的政治权利也不会被剥夺。这和我们对待封建地主阶级的政策是大有区别的。所有这些，即工人阶级的国家领导权和工农的巩固联盟，社会主义经济在国民经济中的领导地位，国内统一战线的关系，并加上有利的国际条件，就是我国所以能够通过和平道路消灭剥削制度、建成社会主义社会的必要条件。
    至于各少数民族地区的社会主义改造，更要充分注意各民族发展的特点。对于这个问题，我在以后还要说到。
    其次，关于富农问题。在人民的讨论中有不少的人问：宪法草案规定“国家对富农经济采取限制和逐步消灭的政策”，应当怎样了解？我们认为富农经济是农村中的资本主义经济，富农是农村中最后的一个剥削阶级。在我国，富农经济原来就不发达。在土地改革中，富农出租的那一部分土地已被分配。在土地改革后，由于农村中生产合作、供销合作、信用合作的发展，由于国家执行了对粮食和其他主要农产品的统购统销政策，富农经济已大大地受了限制。农村中虽然又产生了少数新富农，但是一般说来，富农经济不是上升，而是下降的。现在富农每人平均占有的土地比一般农民占有的土地只多一倍。过去的富农现在多已不雇工人或很少雇工人，放高利贷的减少了，经营商业的也受到了很大限制。所以，在我国，可以用合作化和限制富农经济发展的办法，逐步消灭农村中的资本主义。当然，斗争是不可避免的，富农的破坏活动是不可忽视的。在许多地方都发现有富农抵抗统购统销和破坏互助合作的事实。对于有破坏行为的富农分子，必须加以处罚。但是根据我国的整个政治经济情况来看，今后可以不需要发动一次像土地改革那样的特别的运动来消灭富农。将来对于那些已经放弃剥削行为的原来的富农，可以在当地农业生产合作社已经巩固的前提下，根据一定的条件，并在取得农民的允许以后，让他们分别参加合作社，继续加以改造。
    其次，在人民的讨论中还有不少的人问：宪法草案一方面规定，国家依照法律保护资本家生产资料所有权和其他资本所有权，另一方面又规定，要对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造，要逐步以全民所有制代替资本家所有制，这岂不是互相矛盾么？
    如果说这里有什么矛盾的话，那么，这正是反映着客观生活中存在的矛盾。在我国过渡时期，既有社会主义，又有资本主义，这两种所有制的矛盾就是客观存在的矛盾。同时，资本主义工商业在现阶段一方面有它的有利于国计民生的作用，另一方面又有它的不利于国计民生的作用，这又是资本主义工商业本身客观存在的矛盾。我们解决社会主义与资本主义的矛盾的政策，就是一方面允许资本家所有制存在，利用资本主义工商业有利于国计民生的作用，另一方面限制资本主义工商业的不利于国计民生的作用，采用过渡办法，准备条件，以便逐步以全民所有制代替资本家所有制。宪法草案所规定的关于过渡到社会主义社会的一些具体步骤，就是为了要正确地解决这种矛盾。
    在我国的具体条件下，我们认为我们所采取的建设社会主义的方针和方法是正确的。这个真理，还可以从反面，就是从敌人的叫喊中和某些外国资产阶级报纸的评论中得到证实。
    帝国主义者和台湾蒋介石卖国集团非常不喜欢我们建设社会主义，他们每天都在攻击我们。这有什么奇怪呢？原来我们是做对了。
    有些外国资产阶级报纸失望地发现，在我们的宪法草案中所宣布的道路，“就是苏联所走过的道路”。是的，我们所走的道路就是苏联走过的道路，这在我们是一点疑问也没有的。苏联的道路是按照历史发展规律而为人类社会必然要走的道路。要想避开这条路不走是不可能的。我们一向认为马克思列宁主义是普遍的真理。
    为了破坏我们的社会主义事业，狡猾的敌人还特别雇用了一些人，如像托洛茨基陈独秀分子，他们装成“左”的面孔，攻击我们的社会主义改造事业的具体步骤和具体措施。他们说，我们做得“太不彻底”，“太妥协”，
  “离开了马克思主义”。他们想用这些胡说混淆人们的视听。他们要我们破裂同民族资产阶级的联盟，立即剥夺民族资产阶级。他们又嫌我们的农业政策“太慢了”，他们要我们破裂同农民的联盟。这些难道不是完全的胡说吗？我们如果照这样作，当然只有帝国主义和蒋介石卖国贼最为高兴。
    我国人民既有建设社会主义的坚定目标，又有切实可行的具体步骤，这就不能不使我们的敌人大大地不高兴了。敌人最不高兴的事情，就是对我国人民最好的事情，这是用不着说的。
    第三、关于我国人民民主的政治制度和人民的权利和义务
    宪法草案第二条规定：“中华人民共和国的一切权力属于人民。人民行使权力的机关是全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会。”这个规定和其他条文的一些规定表明我们国家的政治制度是人民代表大会制度。根据我国人民革命根据地政治建设的长期经验，并参照苏联和各人民民主国家的经验，在五年以前，我们的共同纲领就确定了我们国家的这种政治制度。宪法草案总结了五年以来国家机关工作的经验和各级各界人民代表会议的经验，对我们国家的政治制度作出了更加完备的规定。我们采用这种政治制度，是同我们国家的根本性质相联系的。中国人民就是要用这样的政治制度来保证国家沿着社会主义的道路前进。
    人民代表大会制度所以能够成为我国的适宜的政治制度，就是因为它能够便利人民行使自己的权力，能够便利人民群众经常经过这样的政治组织参加国家的管理，从而得以充分发挥人民群众的积极性和创造性。显然，如果没有一种适宜的政治制度使人民群众能够发挥管理国家的能力，那么，人民群众就不能很好地动员和组织起来建设社会主义。
    我国的各级人民代表大会是在普选的基础上产生的。宪法草案规定，凡年满十八岁的公民，不分民族、种族、性别、职业、社会出身、宗教信仰、教育程度、财产状况、居住期限，都有选举权和被选举权。由于现在的各种具体条件，我国在选举中还必须依照法律在一定时期内剥夺封建地主和官僚资本家的选举权和被选举权，还必须规定城市和乡村选举代表名额的不同的人口比例，实行多级选举制，并且在基层选举中多数是采用举手表决的方法。我国的选举制度是要逐步地加以改进的，并在条件具备以后就要实行完全的普遍、平等、直接和秘密投票的制度。但是现行的选举制度是适合于我国目前时期的情况的，对于人民最便利，并且能够照顾各少数民族和各民主阶级，使他们有适当的代表名额。从这样的选举中产生的各级人民代表大会，能够充分代表人民的意志，所以这是具有高度民主性质的人民代表机关。
    依照宪法草案的规定，我国的全国人民代表大会完全统一地行使最高的国家权力，而我们的国家行政机关，从国务院到地方各级人民委员会，都由全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会这样的国家权力机关产生，受它们的监督，并可以由它们罢免。所以，我们的国家行政机关决不能脱离人民代表大会或者违背人民代表大会的意志而进行活动。适应我国的实际情况，并根据中华人民共和国成立以来建设最高国家权力机关的经验，我们的国家元首职权由全国人民代表大会所选出的全国人民代表大会常务委员会和中华人民共和国主席结合起来行使。我们的国家元首是集体的国家元首。同时，不论常务委员会或中华人民共和国主席，都没有超越全国人民代表大会的权力。
      我们国家的大事不是由一个人或少数几个人来决定的。人民代表大会制既规定为国家的根本政治制度，一切重大问题就都应当经过人民代表大会讨论，并作出决定。全国性的重大问题，经过全国人民代表大会讨论和决定，在它闭会期间，经过它的常务委员会讨论和决定；地方性的重大问题经过地方人民代表大会讨论和决定。我国的人民代表大会就是这样能够对重大问题作出决定并能够监督其实施的国家权力机关。
    宪法草案第二条第二款规定：“全国人民代表大会、地方各级人民代表大会和其他国家机关，一律实行民主集中制。”我们经过人民代表大会制统一和集中行使国家的权力，就说明了我们的民主集中制。在香港出版的反动刊物说我们“这种人民代表大会制乃是中央集权的制度”。这些反动分子自以为发现了一种什么理由可以用来攻击我们。可是我们马克思列宁主义者早就公开地宣布过，我们是主张集中制的。问题是什么样的集中：是少数大封建主或大资本家的专制的集中呢，还是以工人阶级为领导的人民大众的民主的集中呢？这两种集中制度，当然是完全不同的两回事情。正如宪法草案中所规定的，我们在这里是把高度的集中和高度的民主结合在一起的。我们的政治制度有高度的集中，但是这种高度的集中是以高度的民主为基础的。
    人民当自己还处在被压迫地位的时候，不可能把自己的意志和力量充分地集中起来。中国人民在过去被人讥笑为“一盘散沙”，就是因为这个原故。革命使得人民的意志和力量集中起来了。而当人民已经得到解放并建立了自己的国家以后，当然就要把自己的意志和力量充分地集中到国家机构里去，使国家机构成为一个坚强的武器。人民的国家机构越是坚强，它就越有能力保卫人民的利益，保障人民的民主权利，保障社会主义的建设。
    毛泽东同志在“论联合政府”一书中说到我们国家政治制度的时候，清楚地指出：“它是民主的，又是集中的，就是说，在民主基础上的集中，在集中指导下的民主。”这就是我们的原则。
    有不少的人，常常错误地把民主和集中看做是绝对对立而不能互相结合的两回事。他们以为，有了民主就不能有集中，有了集中就不能有民主。他们看到我们国家机关中的人民的政治一致性，看到全国高度的统一领导，就企图证明在我们这里“没有民主”。他们的错误在于他们不了解人民民主，也就不能了解建立于人民民主基础上的集中。
    人民的共同利益和统一意志，是人民代表大会和一切国家机关工作的出发点。因此，在这一切国家机关中，也就能够在民主的基础上形成人民的政治一致性。但是，不能因为政治上的一致性而取消或者缩小批评和自我批评。恰恰相反，批评和自我批评是我们民主生活的一种极重要的表现。在我们的一切国家机关中，工作中的缺点和错误总是有的，因此，在全国人民代表大会的会议上，在地方各级人民代表大会的会议上，在一切国家机关的会议上和日常活动中，都要充分地发扬批评和自我批评。我们必须运用批评和自我批评的武器来推动国家机关的工作，不断地改正缺点和错误，反对脱离群众的官僚主义，使国家机关经常保持同群众的密切联系，正确地反映人民群众的意志。如果没有充分的批评和自我批评，也就不能达到和保持人民的政治一致性。压制批评，在我们的国家机关中是犯法的行为。
    从资产阶级的观点出发，是不能理解我们国家的政治制度的。许多外国资产阶级的报纸评论了我们宪法草案中的政治制度。有一些人因为我们的人民代表大会拥有广泛的权力而感到奇怪，说什么“尤其是全国人民代表大会职权的强大，不得不令人吃惊”。另有一些人却在那里争论我们中华人民共和国主席的地位是像法国的总统呢，还是像美国的总统。这些评论家总想用资产阶级国家的政治制度来衡量我们的制度，或者根据他们主观上一些奇奇怪怪的想法说这样那样。但可惜的是他们还没有看到最大的和最根本的事情，他们还没有看到中国历史上已经发生的巨大变化，这个变化就是以工人阶级为首的中国人民已经当了中国的主人。
    还有一些外国资产阶级的评论家攻击我们国家的集中制和人民的集体主义，并且根据这点说，在我国“没有个人自由”，“忽视个人利益”。因此，我想说一下高度的集中和人民的集体主义是不是妨害人民群众的个人利益和个人自由的问题。
    在宪法草案的许多条文中，规定了我国公民享有广泛的自由和权利。宪法草案规定公民有言论、出版、集会、结社、游行、示威的自由，并且规定国家要供给必需的物质上的便利，以保证公民享受这些自由。宪法草案还规定：“公民的人身自由不受侵犯。任何公民，非经人民法院决定或者人民检察院批准，不受逮捕。”“公民的住宅不受侵犯，通信秘密受法律的保护。”“公民有居住和迁徙的自由。”宪法草案又规定公民有劳动的权利和受教育的权利、劳动者有休息的权利和在年老、疾病或者丧失劳动能力的时候获得物质帮助的权利，并且规定国家要逐步扩大现在还不充分的物质条件，以保证公民享受这些权利。此外，宪法草案还规定公民有宗教信仰的自由。我们的国家所以能够关心到每一个公民的自由和权利，当然是由我国的国家制度和社会制度来决定的。任何资本主义国家的人民群众，都没有也不可能有我国人民这样广泛的个人自由。
    有些外国评论家看到我们一方面要保卫人民的民主自由权利，另一方面要镇压一切叛国的和反革命的活动，惩办一切卖国贼和反革命分子，他们就觉得奇怪。当然，如果有人希望我们在宪法中去保障卖国贼和反革命分子活动的自由，那就只能使他失望。对于意图奴役我们的外国帝国主义者和帝国主义的走狗们，我们的宪法和一切法律是永远也不会让他们得到一点方便的。难道不正是因为我们剥夺了卖国贼和反革命分子的自由，人民才有了真正的自由么？
    有些外国评论家看到我们一方面保障公民有宗教信仰的自由，另一方面惩办那些形式上披着宗教外衣而实际上进行反革命活动的帝国主义分子和叛国分子，他们就觉得奇怪。当然，如果有人希望我们去保护那些对于我国人民民主政权进行颠覆活动的帝国主义分子和叛国分子的自由，那就同样只能使他失望。根据宪法草案的规定，我们的国家将如同过去一样切实地保障公民有宗教信仰自由的权利，但是，保障宗教信仰自由和保障反革命活动自由，是绝对不能混同的两件事，我们的宪法和一切法律同样是永远不会让那些披着宗教外衣进行反革命活动的分子得到一点方便的。这种道理也没有任何难于理解的地方。
    在资本主义制度下，国家只是保障剥削阶级极少数人的利益和自由，而剥夺极大多数人的利益和自由。在我们这里，恰恰相反，我们绝不容许任何人为了个人或者少数人的利益和自由而妨害大多数人的利益和自由，妨害国家和社会的公共利益。因为这种理由，所以宪法草案第十四条规定：“国家禁止任何人利用私有财产破坏公共利益。”在我们这里，妨害公共利益的所谓“自由”，当然要受到限制和禁止。但是，我们的国家是充分地关心和照顾个人利益的，我们国家和社会的公共利益不能抛开个人的利益；社会主义，集体主义，不能离开个人的利益；我们的国家充分保障国家和社会的公共利益，这种公共利益正是满足人民群众的个人利益的基础。
    我们的国家能够鼓舞广大的人民群众积极地参加国家和社会的公共生活，并且使人民群众从集体主义的观点出发，在公共生活中自觉地遵守他们对社会、对国家应尽的各项义务，这是我们的人民民主制度符合人民利益的证明。人民群众是否因为有了集体主义，尽了对于社会、对于国家的义务，就会丧失个人利益和个人自由呢？当然不是的。在人民民主制度和社会主义制度下，人民群众能够体验到国家与社会的公共利益和个人利益是不可分的，是一致的。在人民民主制度和社会主义制度下，人民有了完全的民主权利，同时也有完全的义务。人民既然完全地行使了国家权力，也就会以主人的身份尽完全的义务。
    在我们的国家里，人民的权利和义务是完全一致的。任何人不会是只尽义务，不享受权利；任何人也不能只享受权利，不尽义务。宪法草案规定公民必须遵守宪法和法律，遵守劳动纪律，遵守公共秩序，尊重社会公德；并且规定公民有爱护和保卫公共财产的义务，有依照法律纳税的义务，有依照法律服兵役的义务。宪法草案又规定，“保卫祖国是中华人民共和国每一个公民的神圣职责”。宪法草案所规定的这些义务都是每一个公民无例外地必需遵守的。宪法草案的这些规定，将进一步地提高人民群众对于我们伟大祖国的庄严的责任感。因为我们的国家是人民的国家，国家和人民的利益完全
  一致，人民就自然要把对国家的义务看做自己应尽的天职。任何人如果企图逃避这些义务，就不能不受到社会的指责。
    我国人民愿意贡献自己的力量来保卫我们的祖国，来不断地加强人民民主制度，来参加伟大的社会主义事业，当然也就是因为我们的祖国越是强盛，我们的人民民主制度越是强有力，我们的社会主义事业越是向前发展，人民的自由和权利也就越有保障，越能够扩大。
    第四、关于民族自治问题
    宪法草案的序言和其他许多条文规定了国内各民族间平等友爱互助的关系，保障了各少数民族的自治权利。
    中华人民共和国成立以来，已经废除了民族压迫制度，建立了国内各民族平等友爱互助的新关系，各少数民族地区的政治、经济和文化的事业开始逐步发展，人民生活开始逐步改善。我国已经成为自由平等的民族大家庭。宪法草案总结了这方面的经验，对于民族区域自治，对于各少数民族的政治、经济和文化建设，作了比共同纲领更进一步的规定。
    我们的国家是工人阶级领导的人民民主国家，并且正向着建成社会主义社会的目标前进，所以我们的国家能够用彻底的民主主义和民族平等的精神来解决民族问题，建立国内各民族之间的真正合作。我们坚决地认定，必须让国内各民族都能积极地参与整个国家的政治生活，同时又必须让各民族按照民族区域自治的原则自己当家作主，有管理自己内部事务的权利。这样，就能够消灭历史上残留下来的民族间的隔阂和歧视，不断地增进各民族间的相互信任和团结。
    宪法草案明确地规定，我国公民，不分民族、种族，一律都享有平等的权利，并且宣布，对任何民族的歧视和压迫，在我国都是不合法的。宪法草案还规定，各民族都有使用和发展自己的语言文字的自由，都有保持或者改革自己的风俗习惯的自由。宪法草案把我们国家在民族问题上所遵守的人民民主主义和社会主义的原则以及根据这种原则所应当采取的具体措施，用法律的形式肯定下来了。
    宪法草案反映了我国各民族利益的一致性。一百多年以来，我国各民族，包括汉族和各兄弟民族在内，共同遭受了外国帝国主义的压迫。帝国主义者曾经进行各种阴谋，破坏我国各民族间由于长远的历史而形成的联系，企图实现他们的“分而治之”的侵略政策。中华人民共和国成立，使中国各民族都从帝国主义压迫下得到了解放，但是帝国主义者仍旧在处心积虑，妄想分离我国各民族，借以达到他们的重新奴役我国各民族的目的。面对着帝国主义者的这种侵略阴谋，我国各民族都必须提高警惕，不要给帝国主义者进行这种阴谋以任何机会。我国各民族都必须加强和巩固我们祖国的统一，必须紧紧地团结在一起，共同为建设伟大的祖国而努力。宪法草案宣布中华人民共和国是统一的多民族国家，并宣布各民族自治地方都是中华人民共和国不可分离的部分。显然，这样的规定是完全必要的，是完全符合我国各民族的共同利益的。
    宪法草案通过各种规定，保证各少数民族在聚居的地方，都能真正行使自治权。民族自治地方的自治机关，不仅行使一般的地方国家机关的职权，而且能够依照宪法和法律规定的权限管理本地方的财政，依照国家的军事制度组织本地方的公安部队，可以制定自治条例和单行条例以适应当地民族的政治、经济和文化的特点。民族自治地方的自治机关的形式，可以依照实行区域自治的民族大多数人民的意愿去规定。自治机关在执行职务的时候要使用当地民族通用的语言文字。在只有一个乡的民族聚居地区内，虽然不可能也不需要建立自治机关行使上述各种自治权，但也要设立民族乡，以适应聚居的民族成份的特殊情况。
    必须指出，大民族主义和地方民族主义都是错误的。这种思想，对于我国各民族的团结和民族区域自治的实行，都是有害的。我们从宪法草案的序言中可以看到，为着继续加强民族的团结，不仅要反对帝国主义和各民族内部的人民公敌，也要反对大民族主义和地方民族主义。
    汉族在我国人口中占有极大的多数，由于历史条件的关系，汉族的政治、经济和文化在国内各民族中也发展得较高，但是决不能因此就以为汉族可以享受任何一点特权，就可以在其他兄弟民族面前表示任何一点骄傲。恰恰相反，汉族倒有特别的义务去帮助各兄弟民族的发展。各少数民族虽然已经获得了民族平等的权利，但是如果仅仅依靠他们自己的条件和力量，就还不能迅速地克服原来经济上和文化上的落后状况。因此，汉族的帮助对他们是很重要的。汉族人民，特别是派到各少数民族地区工作的汉族干部，必须时时刻刻为少数民族经济文化的发展和生活水平的提高设想，全心全意为少数民族服务，并且要耐心地帮助当地民族干部逐步地成长起来，以便由他们自己担负本地区的各种领导工作。由于过去反动统治阶级的影响，在汉族人民中，以至在汉族干部中，还存在一种大汉族主义思想。例如：不尊重少数民族的风俗习惯，不尊重少数民族的语言文字，不承认少数民族有宗教信仰的自由，不承认少数民族有管理自己内部事务的权利，在少数民族地区工作而不尊重少数民族干部，不同他们商量办事，不相信他们能够在实际工作中提高自己管理各种事务的能力等等。毫无疑问，这种大汉族主义的思想和行为，必然会起破坏民族团结的作用，也完全是我们的国家制度所不允许的。汉族人民和汉族工作干部必须随时注意克服大汉族主义思想。另一方面，在各少数民族中存在着一种地方民族主义思想。这种地方民族主义和大汉族主义同样是长期历史的遗物。应当指出，这种地方民族主义的思想和行为，同样足以妨害各民族间的团结，而且完全有害于自己民族的利益，所以同样是应当克服的。
    建设社会主义社会，这是我国国内各民族的共同目标。只有社会主义才能保证每一个民族都能在经济和文化上有高度的发展。我们的国家是有责任帮助国内每一个民族逐步走上这条幸福的大道的。
    但是各民族有不同的历史条件，决不能认为国内各民族都会在同一时间、用同样的方式进入社会主义。宪法草案序言中说：“国家在经济建设和文化建设的过程中将照顾各民族的需要，而在社会主义改造的问题上将充分注意各民族发展的特点。”这就是说，在什么时候实行社会主义改造以及如何实行社会主义改造等等问题上，都将因为各民族发展情况的不同而有所不同。在这一切问题上，应当容许各民族人民群众以及在各民族中同人民群众有联系的公众领袖们从容考虑，并按照他们的意愿去作决定。
    在某些少数民族中进行社会主义改造的事业，将比汉族地区开始得晚一些，而且他们的社会主义改造所需要的时间也会长一些。当这些少数民族进行社会主义改造的时候，社会主义事业可能在全国大部分地区内已经有了很大的成效，这些少数民族将来的社会主义改造事业也就会有更为顺利的条件，因为在那个时候国家会有更多的物质力量去帮助他们。少数民族的广大人民，由于看到全国范围内社会主义胜利的好处，也会愿意走这条路。即使还有少数人担心社会主义改造会损害自己个人的利益，国家也会采取必要的政策，妥当地安顿他们的生活。所以社会主义改造，在少数民族地区，可以用更多的时间和更和缓的方式逐步地去实现。现在还没有完成民主改革的少数民族地区，今后也可以用某种和缓的方式完成民主改革，然后逐步过渡到社会主义。在我们国家内，在各少数民族中，任何人只要拥护人民民主制度，团结在祖国大家庭里，就都有自己的光明前途，在社会主义社会中都有自己的出路，这是一定的。
    以上是关于宪法草案基本内容的说明。
    三、关于全民讨论中提出的对宪法草案的意见
    全国人民群众在讨论宪法草案的时候，提出了很多修改和补充的意见，也提出了一些问题。对于这些意见和问题，有一部分我在前面已经作了回答，现在我要说到人民群众在讨论中对宪法草案所提出的另外一部分意见和问题。
    人民群众提出的意见，宪法起草委员会都作了考虑。在这些意见中，有一部分意见所涉及的问题不是属于宪法的内容，而是属于其他各种法律的内容，这一部分意见应当在制定其他法律的时候去处理。
    由于采纳了群众的意见，宪法草案已经有了若干改动，有些是内容的改动，有些是文字和修辞上的改动。在这里，不需要把现在向各位代表提出的经过修改了的这个宪法草案当中的每一点修改都列举出来，我只举出以下几点比较重要的修改，并加以说明。
    一、关于宪法草案第三条第三款的修改。这一款规定：“各民族都有发展自己的语言文字的自由，都有保持或者改革自己的风俗习惯和宗教信仰的自由。”这原来是采用共同纲领同一内容的条文。有人建议，在这一款里，不只应当规定各民族都有发展自己的语言文字的自由，而且还应当规定各民族都有使用自己的语言文字的自由。又有人提出，宪法草案第八十八条既已规定
  “中华人民共和国公民有宗教信仰的自由”，那这一款关于保持或者改革宗教信仰自由的规定就是重复的，建议删去。宪法起草委员会认为这些建议是正确的，因此将第三条第三款改为“各民族都有使用和发展自己的语言文字的自由，都有保持或者改革自己的风俗习惯的自由”。
    二、关于宪法草案第五条的修改。这一条所叙述的是我国现有的各种生产资料所有制。有人主张应当写明，在这一条内列举的四种所有制，即国家所有制、合作社所有制、个体劳动者所有制和资本家所有制，只是我国现有的主要的所有制，而不是全部的所有制。提出这个修改意见的人认为，我国现在除了在这一条内列举的四种所有制以外，还存在另外的一些所有制，因此，如果不在这一条的原文中增加“主要”二字，那是有缺点的。
    宪法起草委员会认为这个意见符合我国现在的实际情况。按照实际情况，在我国的若干少数民族地区内，现在存在着封建所有制，甚至还存在着比封建所有制更加落后的所有制。宪法草案第七十条第四款规定：民族自治地方的自治机关“可以依照当地民族的政治、经济和文化的特点，制定自治条例和单行条例”。这里所说的“经济特点”就包含了若干少数民族地区各种特殊的所有制的问题。当然，这些所有制，在我国整个国民经济中，只占极少的份量。此外，在尚待解放的台湾省，美国帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团现在还对台湾人民进行着残酷的压迫和掠夺，在那里，外国帝国主义者所有制、官僚资本家所有制和地主所有制不只是存在，而且还占统治地位。上述这些所有制都不是第五条列举的四种所有制能包括的。因此，宪法起草委员会采纳了这个意见，在第五条上加了“主要”二字。
    第五条的另一个修改是写明了合作社所有制即劳动群众集体所有制。这个修改使合作社所有制的含义更加明确了。
    三、宪法草案第八、第九、第十各条的第一款都做了修改。这几款的原文是分别规定国家依照法律保护农民、手工业者和其他个体劳动者以及资本家的生产资料所有权和其他财产所有权。宪法草案原来的这些规定和第十一条的规定，在内容上是有重复的，因为第十一条规定“国家保护公民的合法收入、储蓄、房屋和各种生活资料的所有权”，这个规定包括了全体公民，包括了生产资料以外的一切财产的所有权。现在我们把第八条第一款改为“国家依照法律保护农民的土地所有权和其他生产资料所有权”；把第九条第一款改为“国家依照法律保护手工业者和其他非农业的个体劳动者的生产资料所有权”；把第十条第一款改为“国家依照法律保护资本家的生产资料所有权和其他资本所有权”，这一款里的“其他资本”，是指资本家的除生产资料以外的其他形式的资本，例如商业资本。经过这样的修改，就避免了前后条文内容的重复。
    四、宪法草案第二十三条第一款的原文规定“全国人民代表大会由省、直辖市、少数民族、军队和华侨选出的代表组成”，现在改为“全国人民代表大会由省、自治区、直辖市、军队和华侨选出的代表组成”。因为在选举全国人民代表大会代表的时候，少数民族并不是一种选举的单位，只有自治区才是同省、直辖市同样的区域性的选举单位。所以应当作这样的修改。
    但是全国人民代表大会中各少数民族的代表不只是从自治区产生，而且更多的是从各省和直辖市产生，因此各省和直辖市在选举全国人民代表大会代表的时候，必须注意到使少数民族有适当名额的代表。为此，我们把第二十三条的第二款也作了修改，修改后的条文特别指出，在选举法中应当规定少数民族代表的名额和产生办法。事实上，一九五三年三月中央人民政府颁布的“中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会选举法”，就已经是这样做的。
    五、宪法草案的第三十四条和第三十五条作了修改，这两条是关于全国人民代表大会所设立的各种委员会的规定。
    依照第三十四条的规定，全国人民代表大会设立民族委员会、法案委员会、预算委员会、代表资格审查委员会和其他需要设立的委员会。这些委员会都是经常性的组织。它们的任务是协助全国人民代表大会工作。根据工作情况，民族委员会和法案委员会在全国人民代表大会闭会期间还要协助全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作，而预算委员会和代表资格审查委员会就只是在全国人民代表大会开会期间才进行工作。为了表明这两类委员会工作情况的区别，对第三十四条的第二款作了一点修改，写明“民族委员会和法案委员会，在全国人民代表大会闭会期间，受全国人民代表大会常务委员会的领导”。
    第三十五条规定的是全国人民代表大会为着调查特定问题组织的委员会。这种委员会是临时性的组织，是全国人民代表大会为了监督其他国家机关的工作而组织的一种委员会，所以这种委员会和第三十四条规定的委员会具有不同的性质。因为原文对这种委员会的性质和任务规定得不明确，所以作了修改。又依照宪法草案第三十一条的规定，全国人民代表大会常务委员会有责任监督其他国家机关的工作，为着实行这种监督，常务委员会应当也有权组织这种调查特定问题的委员会。所以修改后的第三十五条把原来的“全国人民代表大会设立的各种委员会”，改为“全国人民代表大会认为必要的时候，在全国人民代表大会闭会期间全国人民代表大会常务委员会认为必要的时候，可以组织对于特定问题的调查委员会”。这样，就把第三十四条和第三十五条规定的两种委员会的区别表明出来了，并且把常务委员会也可以组织这种委员会的权限补充规定上去了。
    六、宪法草案第七十九条第二款增加了“上级人民法院监督下级人民法院的审判工作”的规定。由于我国的地区大，人口多，许多地区交通还很不方便，如果规定只有最高人民法院有权监督地方各级人民法院和专门人民法院的审判工作，是不符合于实际状况的。为了便于纠正审判工作中可能发生的错误，实行上级人民法院监督下级人民法院的审判工作的制度，根据我国建国以来法院工作的经验和从我国现时的条件来看，这是比较适当的。
    七、宪法起草委员会对于宪法草案中有关检察机关的各条的规定作了较大的修改，其中主要是对于第八十一条到第八十四条这四条的修改。从修改后的条文可以看出，我国的检察机关将是最高人民检察院、地方各级人民检察院和专门人民检察院。人民检察院除了设检察长、副检察长和检察员以外，并且设立检察委员会。检察委员会是在检察长领导下处理有关检察工作的重大问题的组织。在人民检察院内设立这样的合议组织，可以保证集体地讨论问题，使人民检察院能够更加适当地进行工作。我们认为，在检察机关采取这种制度是比较适合于我国目前的实际状况的。
    以上是我们考虑了人民群众的意见以后对于宪法草案所作的一些较重要的修改。
    我在这里还要说到经过宪法起草委员会考虑认为不应当采纳的一些意见。当然，在这个报告中把这些意见全部列举出来，是不可能的。我只说到以下几点。
    一、有些人提议在序言中详细地叙述我国的革命历史，例如，更多地说明在我国革命历史中的中国共产党的作用，工农联盟的作用，统一战线的作用，更多地说明一百多年以来革命先烈的奋斗经过，更多地说明中华人民共和国建立以来各方面的成就等等。这一类意见，宪法起草委员会没有采纳。
    有些人对序言提出了两种相反的意见，一种意见认为应当说到共产主义社会的远景，另一种意见认为不应当说到现在还没有实现的东西。这两种意见也没有采纳。
    为什么以上这些意见不应当采纳呢？
    在宪法草案的序言中表明这个宪法是中国人民革命胜利的结果，这是必要的。但是宪法所以需要序言这个部分，更重要的是因为要在序言中说明我国正处在过渡时期这个历史特点，并且着重地指明国家在过渡时期的总任务和实现这个总任务的内外条件。中国人民过去的一切革命历史应当受到尊重，但是如果在宪法的序言中加上许多对宪法并不是必要的历史叙述，那是不适当的。
    因为我们这个宪法是过渡时期的宪法，所以它同社会主义社会已经建成时期的宪法不能不有所区别。一方面，我国现在还没有建成社会主义社会，另一方面，我国现实生活中已经存在着建设社会主义的事实，而且社会主义的建设正在一天一天地发展。宪法不去描画将来在社会主义社会完全建成以后的状况，但是为了反映现在的真实状况，就必须反映正在现实生活中发生着的变化以及这种变化所趋向的目标。如果不指明这个目标，现实生活中的许多事情就不可理解。我们的宪法所以有一部分条文带有纲领性，就是因为这个原故。
    由此可见，如果以为社会主义建设还没有完成，在序言中就不应当提出建成社会主义社会这个目标，这是不对的。但是如果以为在序言中不仅应当提出建成社会主义社会这个目标，而且还应当说到建成社会主义社会以后的远景，即为共产主义而奋斗的目标，那也是不必要的。
    二、有些人提议在第五条中列举我国现有的各种生产资料所有制的时候，还应当提到国家资本主义。宪法起草委员会没有采纳这个意见。因为，目前在我们这里，国家资本主义经济有各种不同的形式，那就是国家所有制同资本家所有制在多种复杂形式下的经济联盟，而不能自成一种独特的所有制。所以在指出各种所有制的第五条中不应当把国家资本主义列举在内。
    三、有些人提议在宪法草案第二章第三节内具体地列出国务院所属各部、各委员会的名称。这个意见宪法起草委员会也没有采纳。因为随着我国国家建设工作的发展，国务院的机构在一定的情况下需要有某些变动，所以在这一节内没有具体列出国务院所属各部门的名称，以免一遇变动就要修改宪法。国务院各部和各委员会的名称，可以在国务院组织法内另行规定。
    四、有些人提出关于地方国家机关的一种修改意见。这种意见认为地方各级人民代表大会也应当和全国人民代表大会一样设立常务委员会。宪法起草委员会没有采纳这个意见。
    全国人民代表大会工作的繁重，当然不是地方各级人民代表大会所能够相比的。全国人民代表大会行使国家的立法权，地方各级人民代表大会没有这方面的职权。而且越是下级的人民代表大会，因为地区越小，就越易于召集会议。所以地方各级人民代表大会不需要在人民委员会以外再设立常务机关。地方各级人民委员会是地方各级人民代表大会的执行机关，同时也行使人民代表大会的常务机关的职权。如果另外设立人民代表大会的常务机关，反而会使机构重叠，造成不便。
    五、有些人提议在宪法序言中增加关于中国人民政治协商会议的地位和任务的规定。宪法起草委员会认为在宪法序言中可以不作这样的规定。
    中国人民政治协商会议是我国人民民主统一战线的组织形式。它曾代行全国人民代表大会的职权，这种职权今后当然不再需要由它行使，但是它作为统一战线的组织将在我国的政治生活中继续发挥它的作用。既然它是统一战线的组织，所以，参加统一战线的各党派、各团体，将经过协商，自行作出有关这个组织的各种规定。
    六、还有些人提议在宪法中增加规定我国疆域的条文。宪法起草委员会认为不需要在宪法中增加这样的条文。宪法的基本任务，是用法律的形式规定社会制度和国家制度，而描写国家的具体疆域，并不是它的必要的任务。在联邦国家的宪法中，有必要列举联邦中的各个单位，但我国并不是这种国家。在单一国家中，如果认为有必要把现行的行政区域的划分固定下来，当然也可以在宪法中列举各行政区域单位。但是，现在我国的经济建设正在开始，国内各行政区域的划分还不能说已经完全固定了。例如不久以前，中央人民政府委员会就曾决定合并了若干省的行政单位。所以，在宪法中按照现状列举各行政区域的名称，并不是适宜的。当然，行政区域的划分是不应当轻易变动的，所以宪法草案规定，只有全国人民代表大会有权批准省、自治区和直辖市的划分，而自治州、县、自治县、市的划分也要由国务院来批准。
    人们提议增加有关疆域的条文，有一种用意，是为了要在宪法中肯定台湾是我国领土中不可分的一个部分，这个用意是好的。但是宪法可以不为此而增加新的条文，因为台湾是中国的神圣领土，是从来不发生疑问的。把台湾从美国帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团的统治下解放出来，达到我们全国的完全统一，这是中国人民一定要实现的任务。
    以上是对于人民群众对宪法草案所提出的各种意见的简要的回答。
    四、结论
    各位代表！在全国人民的讨论中，证明了我们的宪法草案是代表全国各族人民的利益的，是实事求是的。人民群众在讨论宪法草案的时候说：“宪法草案把全国人民在中国共产党和毛主席领导下作过的许多事情都写上了；把现在已经开始做、以后应当做又能够做的事情也写上了。”“我们应当怎样走到社会主义，一条一条地都摆出来了。”“宪法草案标志着各少数民族的政治、经济和文化的建设事业将得到更大的发展。”广大群众认为我们起草的宪法是“幸福生活的保证”，认为宪法草案的“每一条都代表着人民的利益”。这是人民群众对宪法草案所作的结论，显然，这种结论是正确的。
    我们的宪法草案，经过全国人民代表大会通过以后，将成为我国的国家根本法。这个宪法既然是表达了人民群众的亲身经验和长期心愿，它就一定能够在我国的国家生活中起巨大的积极的作用，一定会鼓舞人民群众为保卫和发展我们的胜利成果而斗争，为粉碎一切企图破坏我国社会制度和国家制度的敌人而斗争，为促进我国建设事业的健全发展和加速我国建设的进度而斗争。宪法是全体人民和一切国家机关都必须遵守的。全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会的代表以及一切国家机关的工作人员，都是人民的勤务员，一切国家机关都是为人民服务的机关，因此，他们在遵守宪法和保证宪法的实施方面，就负有特别的责任。
    中国共产党是我们国家的领导核心。党的这种地位，决不应当使党员在国家生活中享有任何特殊的权利，只是使他们必须担负更大的责任。中国共产党的党员必须在遵守宪法和一切其他法律中起模范作用。一切共产党员都要密切联系群众，同各民主党派、同党外的广大群众团结在一起，为宪法的实施而积极努力。
    中华人民共和国宪法的颁布，不仅会使全国人民欢欣鼓舞，而且也会使我们在全世界一切国家中的朋友感到高兴。人民的中国在国际间有很多的朋友。伟大的苏联和各人民民主国家是我们亲密的朋友，全世界一切国家爱好和平的人民都是我们的朋友。我们在国际间的朋友对我们事业的支持，是我们取得胜利的主要条件之一。我们的朋友为我们的胜利而高兴是可以理解的。中国革命的胜利具有伟大的世界历史意义，中国社会主义建设和社会主义改造的胜利，同样是具有伟大的世界历史意义的。我们的宪法已经把我国在国际事务中的根本方针规定下来了，这个方针就是要为世界和平和人类进步的崇高目的而努力。我国已经得到的一切成就和将要得到的成就，都有助于全世界人民的和平与进步的共同事业。争取世界的持久和平是我国进行社会主义建设的必要条件。
    我国宪法的颁布，是全国各族人民长期共同奋斗获得了伟大胜利的一个成果，但是这并不是说，宪法颁布以后，宪法所规定的任何条文就都会自然而然地实现起来。不是的。宪法一方面总结了我们过去的奋斗，另一方面给了我们目前的奋斗以根本的法律基础，它在我们国家生活的最重要的问题上，规定了什么样的事是合法的，或者是法定必须执行的，又规定了什么样的事是非法的，必须禁止的。在宪法颁布以后，违反宪法规定的现象并不会自行消灭，但是宪法给了我们一个有力的武器，使我们能够有效地为消灭这些现象而斗争。宪法规定我们的国家要建立社会主义社会，这当然不是说社会主义社会已经是现成的东西，也不是说我们可以坐着等它来到。我们面前还有遥远的道路，在这条道路上必然会有艰难，有曲折，绝对不会是一帆风顺的。宪法的意义是伟大的，宪法交给我们的任务尤其伟大。我们只有经过艰苦的奋斗和顽强的工作，经过不断的努力的学习，克服横在我们面前的种种困难，才能达到我们的目的。我们一点也不要因为我们目前所已经得到的成就而骄傲自满。骄傲自满，对于任何个人，任何阶级，任何政党，任何民族，都是有百害而无一利的。当我们庆祝宪法的制定和颁布的时候，我们全国各族人民必须按照宪法所规定的道路，在中国共产党的领导下，加强团结，继续努力，为保证宪法的完全实施而奋斗，为把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗。
