Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 6th:

    Today, the foreign ministers' meeting of eight countries (United States, Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Thailand, and the Philippines) to discuss the establishment of a new aggressive bloc in Southeast Asia opened in Manila, the capital of the Philippines. The planned new military bloc has been named the "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization." American newspapers particularly pointed out that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization should be to the East what the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is to the West. The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is a product of American diplomacy. Its planners have put forward a very definite aggressive purpose: to suppress the forces in the East striving for peace, freedom, and national independence.
    Why are the imperialist countries so uneasy in the Southeast Asian region?
    To answer this question, we must first look back at the fact that after the Second World War, the people of Asian colonies and dependent countries, especially in Southeast Asia, universally launched struggles for national independence. In some countries in this region, imperialists had to completely abandon their customary methods of colonial plunder. In other countries, they had to compromise, using new and less profitable ways to exploit dependent countries.
    The great Chinese people drove all the vampires from their own country. The Vietnamese people defended their national independence in a nine-year struggle against French colonialists. The Indonesian people have won freedom in an armed struggle against Dutch imperialism. India, Burma, and Ceylon have become independent countries.
    Faced with powerful national liberation movements, imperialist countries had to resort to tricks and make concessions in order to maintain their positions in these or those Asian countries, even if only partially. On the other hand, they wanted to prepare a counter-offensive, to regain lost ground and suffocate national liberation movements.
    The imperialists want to conceal their true intentions, and they煽动人心地 announce that their struggle is not to maintain colonial oppression, but to oppose "communism." This is not the first time the imperialists have made such arguments: the Hitler fascists and Japanese militarists once established the infamous "Anti-Comintern Pact," under this guise they prepared to launch a new world war. Facts have proven that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization planned by American diplomacy is, in essence, a new revision and supplement to this "Anti-Comintern Pact."
    Article 4 of the Southeast Asia Treaty draft requires "each contracting party" to recognize that: "An armed attack by communists within the treaty area against any contracting party or against the territories under the government of Cambodia, Laos, or Free Vietnam (as American propaganda agencies call the puppet Bao Dai regime – Author), or against any (!) state or territory designated by the contracting parties by unanimous agreement, will endanger its own peace and security." This article also requires "each contracting party" to agree that it will "take action to deal with this common danger."
    Everyone knows that Germany and Japan also fabricated the so-called "communist threat." The aggressive blocs of Germany and Japan were officially formed through the "Anti-Comintern Pact" concluded in 1936. Articles 1 and 2 of the "Anti-Comintern Pact" stipulated that the participating countries assumed the obligation to oppose the Comintern and to take "defensive measures" against the Comintern, and clause "B" stipulated that the contracting parties had the obligation to "take severe measures against those who directly or indirectly act in favor of the Comintern at home and abroad..."
    In the American draft of the Southeast Asia Treaty, just like the "Anti-Comintern Pact," the contracting parties are not only obligated to oppose so-called "communist aggression," but also to take action "when any contracting party is threatened by any (!) means other than armed attack, or is affected or threatened by any (!) other facts or circumstances."
    The American diplomatic authorities intend to suppress national liberation movements within the scope of the Southeast Asia Treaty. In doing so, they have once again borrowed the methods of the drafters of the "Anti-Comintern Pact." The contracting parties of the "Anti-Comintern Pact" undertook to take severe measures against those at home and abroad who directly or indirectly posed a danger to imperialist countries.
    It can be seen that the Southeast Asia Treaty is completely using Hitler's rhetoric to deal with national liberation movements. The wording of this draft treaty is deliberately vague and ambiguous, so that in reality, any action against colonial oppression and striving for democratic rights and freedoms can be described as "communist aggression."
    The aggressive nature of the American draft of the Southeast Asia Treaty is so obvious that all Asian countries that respect their freedom and independence have refused to participate in the meeting that opened today in the Philippines, and have not even sent observers.
    Even Pakistan, which is controlled by the United States, is aware that this American plan is unpopular in Asia, and has had to specifically issue a statement pointing out that its participation in the Manila conference does not mean participation in the Southeast Asia Treaty.
    It is worth noting that the countries participating in the Manila conference know that the true face of this group is unspeakable, so they are trying their best to keep the draft of the Southeast Asia Treaty secret. However, the official newspaper of the Philippines published this document, thus throwing the countries participating in the conference into confusion.
    According to a France Presse reporter in Manila, "The publication of the American plan by the local newspapers caused alarm (!) among the foreign delegations in the Philippines, and the American government has protested to the Philippine government because of this."
    The publication of the documents of the Manila conference caused "alarm among the participants," what a great conference for "peace and security," as the US State Department boasted about the Manila conference! According to news from Manila, the Philippine president, under obvious instructions from the United States, rebuked the Philippine foreign minister for prematurely leaking the American draft of the Southeast Asia Treaty. Newspapers reported that the Philippine foreign minister may resign.
    This panic is logical: the planners of the Southeast Asia Treaty group do have something to hide, because as the previously leaked American draft reveals, the purpose of the treaty they are proposing has nothing in common with concern for peace: the drafters of the treaty are not concerned with ensuring peace, but with preparing for war.
    The blatant aggressive nature of the American draft has forced Britain, a major partner in the Philippine negotiations, to consider it deeply. The preparatory meeting of the eight countries in Manila showed that the British delegation had requested that the words "communism" be removed from all places in the American draft that mentioned the fabricated "communist aggression." The French delegation submitted a counter-proposal to the American draft at the expert preparatory meeting. For example, France suggested that the provisions of the treaty concerning so-called "sabotage activities" should only be a "general description."
    Supporters of these amendments seem to believe that removing the words "communism" will help convince the world of... the peace intentions of the warmongers. On the other hand, some say that this new formulation will "provide convenient conditions" for countries such as India, Indonesia, Burma, and Ceylon to make a decision to join the treaty sometime in the future.
    The Philippine government strongly advocated removing any such implication from the American treaty that the Southeast Asia Treaty countries should unite to jointly deal with "purely national movements" within any contracting party. This amendment by the Philippines proves that it wants to remove everything from this draft treaty that exposes the Southeast Asia Treaty as a colonial treaty. However, removing "all these implications" is tantamount to canceling the entire treaty, because the essence of this treaty lies in the fact that its spearhead is directed against any national liberation movement.
    Foreign newspapers emphasize that Britain and France, the main partners of the United States in preparing the Southeast Asia Treaty, have no enthusiasm. There have been reports that Eden does not intend to personally attend the Philippine conference. Mendes-France does not intend to go either. This aroused American annoyance.
    Observers in Manila pointed out that from all indications, there are clearly two different points of view: the Philippines, Thailand, Australia, and New Zealand, which are following the United States, advocate that this treaty should be a military alliance, and the contracting parties should assume rigid obligations; while Britain and France advocate that this treaty should not impose rigid conditions and should be subject to the constitutional procedures of each contracting party. Pakistan reserved the right to indicate its attitude towards the treaty later.
    According to the British "Daily Telegraph and Morning Post," contradictions were already apparent at the first expert meeting: "Some delegations believe that the United States' attempt to drag Laos, Cambodia, and Free Vietnam (referring to Bao Dai Vietnam – Author) into the Southeast Asia Treaty is unrealistic," because these three countries, as everyone knows, have undertaken at the Geneva Conference not to participate in any military blocs.
    The demarcation of the Southeast Asia Treaty area has even caused disputes. It must be pointed out here that the drafters of the American draft are obviously not very familiar with geographical conditions: Article 8 of the draft "explains" that the term "treaty area" used in the draft includes the general area of Southeast Asia and the Southwest Pacific, excluding the area north of 21 degrees 30 minutes north latitude. However, it also says that the area covered by the treaty can be changed through agreement (!). Of course, there is nothing fundamentally new here: for example, Turkey has become an Atlantic country and participated in the North Atlantic Treaty!
    It is no coincidence that American diplomats are expressing their intention to again engage in geographical sophistry: it can be clearly seen from Article 7 of the American draft that they actually want to recruit troops in Manila and drag these or those countries into the aggressive bloc. This article says: "The Contracting Parties may, by unanimous agreement, invite any (!) other state... Any state so invited shall in those circumstances become a Contracting Party." In other words, whoever falls into the net set by the planners of the Southeast Asia Treaty becomes a participant in this treaty, that is to say, this country can be listed as a Southeast Asian country.
    In order to whitewash the aggressive essence of their plan, the drafters of the American draft, as usual, want to cover it up with the name of the United Nations, and in the preamble and Article 1 of the draft of this new military bloc, they particularly emphasize "belief in the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations." In order to find arguments for establishing an aggressive bloc, the US State Department usually mentions Article 52 of the UN Charter, which allows the conclusion of regional agreements, in this situation. However, the military treaty planned by the American diplomatic authorities in Southeast Asia is not even a regional organization in form. Since the organizers of the Southeast Asia Treaty are from both the eastern and western hemispheres, and they also want to drag "any" country into this piecemeal group, while some countries located in Southeast Asia have not participated in this organization, then what kind of regional organization is this Southeast Asia Treaty Organization?
    In fact, of the eight countries participating in the establishment of the Southeast Asia military bloc, six countries—the United States, Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines—are not countries on the Asian continent. Pakistan is attending the meeting with reservations. In this way, only one country in the entire Southeast Asia is participating in the meeting—Thailand, which is subordinate to the United States. Therefore, wouldn't it be more correct to call the true name of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization an aggressive bloc of colonial countries? The plans, goals, and tasks of this group have nothing in common with the interests and wishes of the Asian people. The following facts can also illustrate that the real situation is exactly like this: The organizers of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization stubbornly attempted to undermine the Geneva Conference agreements and wanted to drag Laos, Cambodia, and southern Vietnam into this military bloc in various forms. In this way, in addition to everything else, the organizers of the Southeast Asia military bloc also have a task - to undermine the truce in Indochina.
    The French weekly "International Forum" exposed the aggressive essence of the US plan to establish the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, emphasizing that the purpose of this plan is to consolidate the US's leading role in Southeast Asia. The weekly wrote: "As for the purpose of this organization, the drafters of the plan pointed out: its purpose is basically to re-change the situation in Indochina determined by the Geneva Conference. Although the possibility of resuming military operations in Korea and Indochina has not been openly stated, it is clear that the basis of the American plan is precisely this."
    The existence of this plan has been indirectly confirmed by Mr. Smith, the US Deputy Secretary of State, the official representative of American foreign policy, who said in Washington on August 1: In certain circumstances, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization may automatically (!) take action, and the nature of these actions is not difficult to predict.
    It can be seen that the vigilance of broad public opinion in Asian countries, and not only in Asian countries, is understandable. They are vigilantly watching the conspiracy of American diplomats in the Philippines to piece together a new type of "Anti-Comintern Pact." The people of Asian countries are strengthening their struggle for peace and security to oppose this conspiracy.

    美国在东南亚的侵略计划
    ——“真理报”九月六日刊载的观察家的文章
    今天，讨论在东南亚建立新侵略集团问题的八国（美国、英国、法国、澳大利亚、新西兰、巴基斯坦、泰国和菲律宾）外长会议在菲律宾首都马尼拉开幕。计划中的新军事集团已定名为“东南亚公约组织”。美国报纸特别指出，东南亚公约组织之于东方，应该就像北大西洋公约组织之于西方。东南亚公约组织也正如北大西洋公约组织一样，是美国外交的产儿。它的策划人提出了一个十分肯定的侵略性目的：镇压东方争取和平、自由和民族独立的力量。
    为什么帝国主义国家在东南亚地区要这样的惴惴不安呢？
    要回答这一个问题，首先要回顾一下，在第二次世界大战以后，亚洲、特别是东南亚殖民地和附属国人民普遍地展开了争取民族独立的斗争。帝国主义者在这一地区的一些国家中不得不完全放弃他们素来惯用的殖民地掠夺的方法。在另外一些国家中，他们不得不将就一些，改用新的、利益较少的办法来剥削附属国。
    伟大的中国人民把一切吸血鬼都从自己的国土上驱逐出去了。越南人民在前后九年的反对法国殖民者的斗争中捍卫了自己的民族独立。印度尼西亚人民已在与荷兰帝国主义者的武装斗争中争取得了自由。印度、缅甸和锡兰都成了独立的国家。
    帝国主义国家面对着强大的民族解放运动，它们不得不耍一些手腕，不得不作让步，但求在这些或是那些亚洲国家中保持住自己的阵地，即使只是一部分也好。另一方面它们想准备反攻，要夺回丧失了的阵地，窒息民族解放运动。
    帝国主义者想掩饰自己的真正的意图所在，他们煽动人心地宣布说，他们奋斗的目的不是保持殖民压迫，而是反对“共产主义”。帝国主义者发出这样的论调已经不是第一次了：希特勒法西斯主义者和日本军国主义者当年就曾建立起臭名昭彰的“反共产国际公约”，他们在这一幌子下准备发动新的世界大战。事实证明，现在美国外交所策划的东南亚公约就它的实质来说，就是这种“反共公约”的新的修订和增订版。
    东南亚公约草案第四条要求“每一缔约国”承认：“共产党在本条约区域内用武装进攻的手段对任何缔约国或对柬埔寨、老挝或自由越南政府（美国宣传机关这样称傀儡保大政权——作者）治下的地区，或对各缔约国经一致同意指明的任何（！）国家或地区进行的侵略（！）都会危及它自己的和平与安全。”这一条同时要求“每一缔约国”同意它将“采取行动来对付这个共同的危险”。
    大家都知道，德国和日本也曾捏造过所谓“共产主义的威胁”，德国和日本的侵略集团通过一九三六年所缔结的“反共产国际公约”而正式形成。“反共产国际公约”的第一条和第二条规定，这一公约的参加国家承担有反对共产国际的义务，有对共产国际采取“防御措施”的义务，而“乙”款则规定，缔约各方有义务“对国内外的、直接或间接作出有利于共产国际的行动的人采取严厉的措施……”
    在美国的东南亚公约草案中也和“反共产国际公约”一样，缔约各方不仅有义务反对所谓“共产主义侵略”，而且有义务“在任何缔约国受到武装进攻以外的任何（！）方式的威胁，或受到任何（！）其他事实或情势的影响或威胁时”，也要采取行动。
    美国的外交当局打算在东南亚公约的范围内来镇压民族解放运动，这样他们就重新借用了“反共产国际公约”拟订人的那套方法。“反共产国际公约”的缔约国曾承担有对国内外的、直接或间接造成对帝国主义国家的危险的人采取严厉的措施。
    由此可见，东南亚公约完全是用的希特勒的措词，以便对付民族解放运动。这一公约草案的措词故意弄得这样含糊其词、模棱两可，以致于实际上任何反对殖民者压迫、争取民主权利和自由的行动都可以被说成是“共产主义侵略”。
    美国的东南亚公约草案的侵略本质是这样的显而易见，以致一切尊重自己自由和独立的亚洲国家都拒绝参加今天在菲律宾开幕的会议，甚至连观察员都不派去。
    就连受美国控制的巴基斯坦也意识到美国的这一计划在亚洲不得人心，而不得不专门发表声明，指出它的参加马尼拉会议并不意味着参加东南亚公约。
    值得注意的是，参加马尼拉会议的国家知道这一集团的真面目是见不得人的，因而他们竭力使东南亚公约草案保持秘密。但是菲律宾的官方报纸发表了这一文件，因而使参加会议的国家陷入混乱。
    据法新社驻马尼拉记者报道，“当地报纸公布了美国的方案，这引起在菲律宾的外国代表团的惊恐（！），美国政府因此还对菲律宾政府提出抗议。”
    马尼拉会议的文件的公布引起了“与会者的惊恐”，真是多么好的一个为了“和平与安全”的会议，像美国国务院吹嘘马尼拉会议那样！据来自马尼拉的消息，受到美国明显的指示的菲律宾总统，为了预先泄露美国的东南亚公约草案一事把菲律宾外交部长训斥了一顿。报纸报道，菲律宾外交部长可能提出辞职。
    这种惊慌失措的情况是合乎逻辑的：东南亚公约集团的策划者的确有些东西需要隐瞒，因为正如事先泄露的美国草案所暴露的那样，他们所建议的公约的目的是与对和平的关心毫无共同之处的：公约的拟订者关心的不是保障和平，而是准备战争。
    美国草案的露骨的侵略性质使得参加菲律宾谈判的英国不得不加以深深考虑。在马尼拉举行的八国代表预备会议表明，英国代表团曾要求，凡是美国草案中提到的臆造的“共产主义侵略”的地方，“共产主义”这几个字都一律取消。法国代表团在专家预备会议上对美国的草案提出了一个反建议。例如，法国建议，公约中关于所谓“破坏活动”的条款只作“泛泛的叙述”。
    支持这些修正案的人似乎认为，去掉“共产主义”这几个字有助于使世界相信……战争挑拨者的和平意图。另一方面，有人说，这种新的说法将为像印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、锡兰这样一些国家在将来什么时候作出参加公约的决定“提供便利条件”。
    菲律宾政府极力主张从美国的公约中除去任何这样的暗示，即：东南亚公约国家应团结一致共同对付任一缔约国内的“纯属民族性质的运动”。菲律宾的这个修正案证明它想从这个公约草案中除掉一切暴露东南亚公约是殖民者公约的东西。但是，除去这“一切暗示”，就等于取消整个公约，因为这个公约的本质正在于：它的矛头是针对着任何民族解放运动的。
    外国报纸强调指出，美国准备东南亚公约的主要伙伴——英国和法国毫无热情。关于这一点已有消息说，艾登不打算亲自参加菲律宾会议。孟戴斯—弗朗斯也不打算去。这激起了美国的恼怒。
    马尼拉的观察家们指出，从一切情况看来，显然有两种不同的观点：追随美国的菲律宾、泰国、澳大利亚和新西兰主张这个公约应是一个军事同盟，缔约国应承担硬性的义务；而英国和法国则主张，这个公约不提出硬性的条件，并服从于各缔约国的宪法程序。巴基斯坦保留了以后表明它对公约的态度的权利。
    据英国“每日电讯与晨邮报”指出，在第一次专家会议上就已显出矛盾来了：“有些代表团认为美国想把老挝、柬埔寨和自由越南（指保大越南——作者）拖进东南亚公约的企图是不现实的”，因为这三个国家，大家知道，在日内瓦会议上承担了不参加任何军事集团的义务。
    东南亚公约地区的划定甚至也引起争执。这里不能不指出，美国草案的拟订者显然不大熟悉地理情况：草案第八条“解释”说，草案中所用的“条约区域”这个名词包括东南亚和西南太平洋的一般地区，不包括北纬二十一度三十分以北的地区。然而这里又说，条约所包括的地区可以经过协议（！）而变更。当然，这里没有任何原则上新的东西：例如土耳其就是曾经变成了大西洋国家而参加北大西洋公约的！
    美国外交家表示要再次在地理上来牵强附会，这不是偶然的：从美国草案的第七条中可以明显看出，他们其实是想在马尼拉招兵买马，把这些或那些国家拖进侵略集团。这条说：“各缔约国，经一致同意，得邀请任何（！）其他国家……在这种情况下被邀的任何国家即成为缔约国。”换句话说，谁要落入了东南亚公约策划者布下的罗网，他就变成这个条约的参加者，也就是说可以把这个国家列到东南亚国家中去了。
    美国草案的拟订者为了要粉饰自己计划的侵略实质，照例想把它用联合国的名称掩盖起来，在这个新军事集团的草案的序言和第一条中特别强调“对于联合国宪章的宗旨与原则的信念”。为了要替建立侵略集团寻找论据，美国国务院在这种情形下通常总是提到允许缔结区域性协定的联合国宪章第五十二条。但是，美国外交当局在东南亚所策划的军事公约甚至在形式上也不是区域性的组织。既然东南亚公约的组织者东西两半球都有，而且他们还想把“任何”国家拉到这个杂凑的集团中来，而有些位在东南亚的国家却没有参加这个组织，那么这个东南亚公约组织究竟是一个什么样的区域性组织呢？
    实际上，将参加建立东南亚军事集团的八个国家中，有六个国家——美国、英国、法国、澳大利亚、新西兰和菲律宾——不是亚细亚大陆上的国家。巴基斯坦出席会议是带有保留条件的。这样一来，整个东南亚参加会议的只有一个国家——从属于美国的泰国。因此，如果把东南亚公约组织的真名称叫做殖民国家的侵略集团岂不是更正确些吗？这个集团的计划，宗旨和任务和亚洲人民的利益和愿望没有丝毫共同之处。下面的事实也可以说明事情的实在情况正是如此：东南亚公约组织的组织者们顽固地企图破坏日内瓦会议协议，想用各种各样的形式将老挝、柬埔寨和越南南部拖进这一军事集团。这样，除了其他一切以外，东南亚军事集团的组织者们还有一项任务——破坏印度支那的停战。
    法国“国际论坛”周刊揭穿美国建立东南亚公约组织计划的侵略本质，着重说到这个计划的目的是巩固美国在东南亚的领导作用。这家周刊写道：“至于这个组织的目的，计划的拟订者指出：它的目的基本上是想重新改变日内瓦会议确定的印度支那的局势。虽然并没有公开说明恢复朝鲜和印度支那军事行动的可能性，但显然，美国计划的根据正是这一点。”
    有这个计划的存在，这一点已由美国副国务卿史密斯这样一位美国外交政策的官方代表间接证实，史密斯八月一日在华盛顿说：在某些情况下，东南亚公约组织可能自动地（！）采取行动，这些行动的性质是不难预测的。
    由此可见，亚洲国家、而且不仅是亚洲国家的广大舆论界所怀着的警惕是可以理解的，他们正警惕地注视着美国外交官在菲律宾采取的拼凑新型
  “反共产国际公约”的阴谋。亚洲各国人民正在加强争取和平和安全的斗争，以反对这种阴谋。
