The Office for Receiving the Soviet Exhibition in China began training guides for the Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievement Exhibition on August 10th. More than two hundred guides, after studying basic political and scientific knowledge in the training class, began group-based business studies on September 1st.

During their studies, the guides first understood the great significance of the Soviet Union holding this exhibition in China for our country's construction and the consolidation of Sino-Soviet friendship, so their enthusiasm for learning was very high. Guide Cha Bingying said: "I know that this exhibition is being held by the Soviet Union to help our country build socialism, and we must do a good job in explaining it so that the exhibition can have a great impact on our construction." During the study period, the guides overcame many difficulties, earnestly studied the basic scientific knowledge related to lathes, optical instruments, heavy machinery, agricultural machinery, telecommunications, motors, etc., and visited the Palace Museum and the Hungarian Folk Art Exhibition to learn about the explanations given by the guides. The guides are now studying the explanatory texts of the exhibits while also going to the Soviet Exhibition Hall to learn about the structure of the machines and their functions. Each guide is practicing explaining in front of the group and the entire class to correct the shortcomings of unclear explanations and dull tones. Many guides are stepping up their practice of the speaking points.

    苏联展览馆说明员
    决心做好展品说明工作
    我国接待苏联来华展览办公室，从八月十日开始，为苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会训练说明员。二百多个说明员，在训练班经过学习政治和科学基本知识以后，从九月一日起分组进行业务学习。
    说明员在学习中，首先了解了苏联在我国举办这一展览会，对我国建设和巩固中苏友谊的重大意义，所以学习热情很高。说明员查秉英说：“我知道这个展览会是苏联为了帮助我国建设社会主义而举办的，我们一定把讲解工作做好，让展览会对我们的建设能发生大的作用。”说明员在学习期间克服了许多困难，认真学习了有关车床、光学仪器、重型机械、农业机械、电讯、电机等方面的基本科学知识，并实地参观了故宫历史博物馆、匈牙利民间艺术展览会讲解员讲解的情况。说明员现在正一面学习展览品的说明词，一面到苏联展览馆学习机器的构造和它的作用。每个说明员都在小组和全班学员的面前，进行实习讲解，纠正说明不清、语调枯涩的缺点。许多说明员都在加紧练习讲词。
