(Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, September 5th) Fifty thousand people from all walks of life in Vietnam held a mass rally in Thai Nguyen City, the capital of the Viet Bac Interzone, on the morning of September 4th, to celebrate the ninth anniversary of the August Revolution and the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The rally was hosted by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front.

Those present included: Huang Minh Giam, representative of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and Minister of Propaganda; Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front; Major General Hoang Van Thai, representative of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army; Hoang Quoc Viet, member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Labor Party; representatives of other political parties and mass organizations; ministers and deputy ministers of various government departments; combat heroes; labor models; representatives of ethnic minorities; and many representatives from religious circles.

At the beginning of the rally, Huang Minh Giam, representative of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, first read President Ho Chi Minh's letter to the entire army and people, cadres, soldiers, and overseas compatriots. Hoang Van Thai, representative of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army, read the order of Commander-in-Chief Vo Nguyen Giap.

Next, Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front, spoke.

Ton Duc Thang first expressed his gratitude to President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnam Labor Party, and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for their leadership. He also thanked the people of all countries for their sympathy and support for the Vietnamese people.

Ton Duc Thang then spoke about the Southeast Asia group that US imperialism is planning to organize. He said: The Southeast Asia group is essentially an aggressive bloc, a military alliance aimed at undermining the Indochina armistice agreement and enslaving Southeast Asian countries. The United States has already pulled Britain and France into this conference, and is using various methods to try to get Cambodia, Laos, and South Vietnam to join this group. This is contrary to the spirit of the Geneva Conference and the Indochina armistice agreement, and contrary to the peaceful aspirations of the people of Southeast Asia and the world. The Vietnamese people strongly oppose the organization of the Southeast Asia group and are determined to fight for the consolidation of peace in Indochina and the maintenance of peace in Southeast Asia and the world.

Ton Duc Thang also said: Ngo Dinh Diem, executing the orders of his master, is carrying out activities to undermine the armistice agreement. According to the agreement, the Vietnamese people have the freedom to choose to reside in the South or the North, but Ngo Dinh Diem is using various despicable means to force people to move from the North to the South. All compatriots from North to South and overseas compatriots should unite more closely to oppose all the sinister and vicious schemes of the US imperialists, French war-mongers, and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique.

Ton Duc Thang finally pointed out: The new tasks of the Vietnamese people in the new situation are arduous and heavy, but as long as we unite as one, we will be able to maintain and consolidate peace, develop the achievements of the August Revolution, and build a completely unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam.

The rally concluded with a grand parade. The marching队伍, carrying flags and banners, holding portraits of the leaders of Vietnam and fraternal countries, cheered as they passed the rostrum. The parade lasted for an hour and a half, ending at noon.

    越南各界人民五万人举行大会庆祝国庆
    【新华社北越五日电】越南各界人民五万人九月四日上午在越北联区首府太原市举行群众大会，庆祝八月革命和越南民主共和国建国九周年。
    大会由越南民主共和国政府、越南国民联合战线全国委员会主持。
    到会的有：越南民主共和国政府代表、宣传部部长黄明鉴、越南国民联合战线全国委员会主席孙德胜、越南人民军总司令部代表黄文泰少将、越南劳动党中央政治局委员黄国越以及其他政党和群众团体的代表、政府各部部长和副部长、战斗英雄、劳动模范、少数民族代表和宗教界代表多人。
    大会开始，首先由越南民主共和国政府代表黄明鉴宣读胡志明主席告全国军民、干部、战士和海外侨民书，越南人民军总司令部代表黄文泰宣读武元甲总司令命令。
    接着，越南国民联合战线全国委员会主席孙德胜讲话。
    孙德胜首先对胡志明主席、越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府的领导表示感谢。他还感谢各国人民对越南人民的同情和支持。
    孙德胜接着谈到美帝国主义正在策划组织的东南亚集团。他说：东南亚集团实质上是一个侵略集团，是旨在破坏印度支那停战协定、奴役东南亚各国的军事联盟。美国已经拉了英、法参加这一会议，同时正利用各种办法企图使柬埔寨、老挝和越南南部加入这一集团。这是违背日内瓦会议和印度支那停战协定的精神，违背东南亚和全世界人民和平意愿的。越南人民强烈反对组织东南亚集团，坚决为巩固印度支那的和平、维护东南亚和世界和平而斗争。
    孙德胜又说：吴庭艳执行他的主子的命令，正在进行破坏停战协定的活动。按照协定，越南人民有自由选择居留南部或北部的权利，但是吴庭艳却使用各种卑鄙的手段强迫人民从北部撤到南部去。从北到南的全体同胞和海外侨胞应该更加紧密地团结起来，以反对美帝国主义者、法国好战分子和吴庭艳集团各种阴险恶毒的阴谋。
    孙德胜最后指出：越南人民在新形势下的新任务是艰巨而繁重的，但是只要团结一致，我们就能够维护和巩固和平，发展八月革命的成果、建立一个完全统一、独立、民主和富强的越南。
    大会最后举行盛大的游行。游行队伍打着旗帜和标语牌、举着越南和各兄弟国家的领袖的肖像，欢呼着走过主席台前。游行持续了一小时半，至中午始结束。
