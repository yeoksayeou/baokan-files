Experiences of Theoretical Study Instructors' Work in Primary Groups in Wuzhou City
The Propaganda Department of the Wuzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China

Theoretical study instructors are assistants to theoretical teachers and also assistants to party organizations in providing ideological leadership and theoretical guidance for cadres' theoretical study. In general, primary group instructors in Wuzhou City have played the following four roles in the students' learning: First, helping students grasp the central issues and delve into them; second, correcting students' learning attitudes, introducing learning methods, and encouraging students to exercise free thought and connect with reality; third, answering students' questions as much as possible, and improving students' interest and ability in learning; fourth, assisting the group leader in leading and grasping the study.

The magnitude of the instructor's role is mainly determined by the degree of importance that the party organization attaches to the instructor's work. In the first half of last year, while studying the "Reader on Political Knowledge," although the theoretical teacher gave a central lesson to the instructors after each lecture, and assigned tutoring tasks, because many party branches did not provide specific leadership, supervision, and inspection of the tutoring work, and did not regularly and systematically cultivate and educate them, the development of tutoring work was uneven, and there were many problems. In the second half of the year, at the beginning of the study of the "Reader on Knowledge of Economic Construction," the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department clearly stipulated that the work of instructors should be carried out under the leadership of the branch, and the tutoring work of each system should be directly led by the general branch. It also stipulated that leading the instructors and doing a good job in tutoring work are important tasks for the branch to lead theoretical study. Therefore, the phenomenon of the branch letting tutoring work go unchecked in the past has been basically overcome.

How does the party organization lead the tutoring work and continuously improve the quality of tutoring?

First, strengthen the ideological leadership of the instructors. Ideological leadership mainly involves continuously improving the instructors' understanding of tutoring work, strengthening the instructors' sense of responsibility, and giving full play to their work initiative and creativity in the process of tutoring work. Generally speaking, the instructors' understanding of tutoring work gradually changes with the development of tutoring work. In the past, they had various thoughts, such as thinking that "tutoring work is an extra burden," "there is a contradiction between administrative work and tutoring work," "everyone is about the same," "nothing significant can be achieved no matter how hard you try," etc. For these thoughts, the party organization must resolve them through individual chats, holding instructor forums, and especially summarizing the tutoring work at each stage.

Second, strengthen the theoretical guidance of the instructors. The methods we use for theoretical guidance of instructors are mainly: First, running instructor research classes and collectively training instructors. Last year, we ran the first instructor research class on the "Reader on Knowledge of Economic Construction," which helped instructors grasp the center of the "Reader," as well as the outline of each chapter and section and the method of connecting with reality, and further studied and mastered the basic methods of tutoring, such as grasping the center, grasping the ideological situation of the students, and implementing the principle of connecting theory with reality, so that the instructors improved a step in theoretical level and tutoring methods. At the beginning of the general line study, the instructors also studied a step ahead. Before studying each issue, we asked a member of the Municipal Party Committee (or a theoretical teacher) to give a "central tutoring lesson" to the instructors, and then each branch organized the instructors to discuss it separately. This approach achieved the same effect as holding an instructor training class. Second, after each chapter report by the theoretical teacher, the party's general branch and branch held instructor group leader meetings (or instructor group meetings) to study and arrange the key points of tutoring based on the learning requirements and the specific conditions of each unit, and to introduce materials to the instructors. Organizing instructors to conduct collective research can give play to the wisdom of the instructors, make the research of problems more correct and comprehensive, and improve the quality of tutoring. Third, answering difficult questions. After studying each chapter, there are many difficult questions raised by the students, which have not been resolved after collective research by the instructors and are of a general nature. Therefore, the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department answers them, and then the instructors convey them to the students.

Third, strengthen the organizational leadership of tutoring work. The organizational leadership system is the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department, the Party General Branch, the Branch, down to the instructor group. The city established a meeting and reporting system to regularly study tutoring work.

We believe that the instructor's tutoring work must closely revolve around the five steps of previewing, lecturing, reviewing, discussing, and summarizing (or testing, answering questions). The instructor's tasks are generally: when previewing, pointing out the center of the text to the students and collecting questions to report to the theoretical teacher; when reviewing, mainly helping students grasp the center, introducing reference materials, and at the same time guiding students to prepare before the discussion, such as checking and guiding students to write discussion outlines; during the discussion, mainly focusing on the central issues, raising questions, encouraging students to speak, organizing and guiding students to debate different arguments, and helping the group leader to summarize; after the discussion, mainly exchanging and summarizing tutoring experience, researching and answering the unresolved questions during the discussion as much as possible, and if there is a test, assisting in doing a good job in the test work, in addition, researching and arranging the study of the next unit.

In order to make the tutoring work play its due role, the instructor must:

First, learn a step ahead and study hard. This is the prerequisite for doing a good job in tutoring. The quality of tutoring work is closely related to the instructor's theoretical cultivation. When the Public Security Second Branch was studying the first and second questions of the general line, because the instructor was able to prepare in advance, more problems were solved; when studying the third question of the general line, because the instructor did not adhere to the system of taking the first step, the tutoring work was done poorly. This example shows that if the instructor does not study well first, it is impossible to tutor well.

Second, proceed from the specific situation and tutor different objects. Generally speaking, the students in the study group are of the following three types: The first type has a higher cultural level, a certain theoretical level, and some ability to study independently. What they require is not an introduction to the center of the text, but an introduction to specific materials and how to delve into the central issues; the second type has a certain cultural level, but the theoretical foundation is poor. What they require is an introduction to the center, learning methods, and how to comprehensively understand the main issues of each chapter; the third type has a lower cultural and theoretical level. What they require is not only an introduction to the center and learning methods, but also guidance on how to ask questions, how to understand the content of the document paragraph by paragraph, section by section, and how to write a speech outline. Different requirements and methods must be adopted for the tutoring of these three types of people. The specific approach of the Customs Branch in this regard is: for the first type of people, they are required not only to understand the text thoroughly, but also to deeply understand the essence of the spirit, connect with practical work, and take notes on their experiences; for the second type of people, they are required to understand the text thoroughly, understand the general meaning of the text, add personal understanding, and take notes; for the third type of people, they are required to understand the content of the text, remember the general meaning of the text, and excerpt the text to help them remember. In terms of method, each branch now adopts the method of talking about the center and talking about the main points for the third type of people. However, some instructors feel that they lack tutoring methods for the first type of people. Our opinion is that we can organize them to conduct collective research.

Third, establish a leading core, rely on study backbones, and expand the tutoring force. Tutoring work cannot rely solely on instructors, but must organize the study group leaders and mutual aid group leaders to make them powerful assistants in tutoring work. There are two ways: one is for the instructor to absorb the group leader to participate in the activities; the other is for the instructor to convey and study the results of the first step to the group leader and mutual aid group leader separately after the activities, and to listen to the group leader's report regularly and irregularly, and help them solve problems in learning. No matter which method is adopted, it must be recognized that cultivating backbone elements is a very important task, the purpose of which is to have capable assistants in the tutoring work, and to tutor other students through them. Only in this way can the tutoring work have roots, and can the "solo" phenomenon of instructors be overcome.

Fourth, tutoring work must pay attention to the connection between theory and practice. That is to say, on the one hand, to enable students to understand the center and main issues of the text, to enable students to gain a correct understanding from the debate on different arguments on the issues, and to help solve difficult problems in learning; on the other hand, to enable students to connect theory with practice, deepen their understanding of theory, and enable students to master theory and use correct viewpoints and methods to solve some practical problems in work and thought.

Fifth, the tutoring method should be mainly based on enlightenment and guidance, and the tutoring methods should be flexible and diverse. At present, many instructors use methods such as "talking about the center" and "answering questions" for tutoring. As a result, students reflect: "The instructor talks more, we talk less. It's good, but it's not easy to remember." We use mutual aid chats, forums, spot checks of notes, tests, holding note exhibitions, organizing joint group discussions or classroom discussions, and organizing actual visits to factories, rural areas, and exhibitions for tutoring. For students with lower levels, some individual units have also adopted some other auxiliary methods (such as giving tutoring lessons as possible and necessary) to help them catch up and improve their theoretical interest.

    梧州市初级组理论学习辅导员工作的经验
    中共梧州市委宣传部
    理论学习辅导员是理论教员的助手，也是党组织对干部理论学习进行思想领导和理论指导的助手。梧州市初级组辅导员对学员的学习一般是起了以下四个作用：一、帮助学员掌握中心问题，深入钻研；二、端正学员的学习态度，介绍学习方法，启发学员发挥自由思想，联系实际；三、尽可能地解答学员的疑难问题，提高学员的学习兴趣与能力；四、协助小组长领导和掌握学习。
    辅导员作用的大小主要是由党组织对辅导员工作的重视程度来决定的。去年上半年在学习“政治常识读本”时，虽然每次理论教员授课后给辅导员上中心课，布置了辅导任务，但是由于许多党支部对辅导工作没有具体领导、督促和检查，也没有经常地系统地培养和教育，所以辅导工作发展不平衡，问题较多。下半年，在“经济建设常识读本”学习一开始，市委宣传部即明确规定了辅导员工作是在支部领导下进行的，各系统的辅导工作由总支直接领导。并规定领导辅导员和搞好辅导工作是支部领导理论学习的重要任务。因此，就基本上克服了过去支部对辅导工作放任自流的现象。
    党组织是怎样领导辅导工作和不断提高辅导质量的呢？
    首先是加强对辅导员的思想领导。思想领导主要是在辅导工作过程中，不断提高辅导员对辅导工作的认识，加强辅导员的责任感，充分发挥其工作的主动性和创造性。一般来说，辅导员对辅导工作的认识是随着辅导工作的发展而逐步变化的。过去，他们有着各色各样的思想，如认为“辅导工作是额外负担”“行政工作和辅导工作有矛盾”“大家都是半斤八两”“搞来搞去都搞不出什么名堂”等。对于这些思想，党组织必须要通过个别漫谈，召开辅导员座谈会，特别是每个阶段辅导工作的总结予以解决。
    其次是加强对辅导员的理论指导。对辅导员的理论指导，我们采用的办法主要是：第一，开办辅导员研究班、集体训练辅导员。去年开办了“经济建设常识读本”第一期辅导员研究班，帮助辅导员掌握了“读本”的中心，以及每章每节内容的提要及联系实际的方法，并进一步研究和掌握了辅导的基本方法，如抓住中心、掌握学员的思想情况、贯彻理论联系实际的原则进行辅导等，使辅导员在理论水平和辅导方法上提高了一步。总路线学习开始时，辅导员也先学一步。在学习每个问题之前，请市委委员（或理论教员）向辅导员讲授“辅导中心课”，以后，由各支部分别组织辅导员讨论，这样的做法收到了和举办辅导员训练班同样的作用。第二，理论教员每章报告后，党的总支、支部分别召开辅导员组长会议（或辅导员小组会），根据学习要求，结合各单位的具体情况，研究和布置辅导重点，给辅导员介绍资料。组织辅导员进行集体研究可以发挥辅导员的智慧，使问题研究得更正确、更全面，提高辅导质量。第三，解答疑难问题。每章学习以后，有许多疑难问题是由学员提出，并经辅导员集体研究未获解决而又带普遍性的，于是，市委宣传部就加以解答，再由辅导员向学员传达。
    再次是加强辅导工作的组织领导。组织领导的系统是市委宣传部、党总支、支部、直到辅导员小组。全市建立了会议和汇报制度，定期研究辅导工作。
    我们认为，辅导员的辅导工作，必须紧紧围绕着预习、授课、复习、讨论和小结（或测验、问题解答）等五个步骤来进行。辅导员的任务一般是：预习时，向学员指出课文中心和收集问题汇报理论教员；复习时，主要是帮助学员掌握中心、介绍参考资料，同时指导学员进行讨论前的准备，如检查和指导学员写发言提纲等；讨论时，主要是环绕中心问题，提出问题，启发学员发言，组织和引导学员对不同论点展开争论，并帮助小组长进行总结；讨论以后，主要是交换和总结辅导经验，研究和尽可能解答讨论时尚未解决的问题，如果有测验，则协助搞好测验工作，此外还要研究布置下一单元的学习。
    为了使辅导工作起应有的作用，辅导员必须：
    第一，先学一步，认真学好。这是做好辅导工作的前提。辅导工作的好坏是和辅导员理论修养有着密切关系的。公安二支部在关于总路线的第一、二个问题的学习时，由于辅导员事前能先行准备，所以解决问题也多；在关于总路线的第三个问题学习时，由于辅导员没有坚持先走一步的制度，所以辅导工作做得较差。这一事例说明，辅导员如不先学好，要辅导得好是决不可能的。
    第二，从具体情况出发，针对不同对象进行辅导。一般来说，学习小组的学员有以下三种：第一种是文化水平较高，有一定的理论水平，有些独立钻研的能力，他们要求不是介绍课文中心，而是介绍具体材料，以及怎样环绕中心问题深入钻研；第二种是有一定的文化水平，但理论基础较差，他们的要求是介绍中心、学习方法，以及怎样全面理解每章的主要问题；第三种是文化和理论水平较低，他们的要求不但是介绍中心和学习方法，而且要求指导怎样去提问题，怎样去逐段逐节领会文件内容，怎样写发言提纲等。对这三种人的辅导，就必须采取不同的要求和方法。海关支部的辅导工作在这方面的具体做法是：对第一种人，要求不但弄通课文，而且深入领会精神实质，联系实际工作，记心得笔记；对第二种人，要求弄通课文，领会课文大意，加上个人认识，写笔记；对第三种人，要求懂得课文内容，记得课文大意，摘录课文，以帮助记忆。在方法上，对第三种人，现在各支部都是采取讲中心和讲要点的办法。但对第一种人，有些辅导员感到缺乏辅导办法，我们的意见是可以组织他们集体研究。
    第三、建立领导核心，依靠学习骨干，扩大辅导力量。辅导工作不能单靠辅导员，而一定要将学习小组长、互助组长组织起来，使他们成为辅导工作的有力助手。办法有二：一种是辅导员在活动时吸收小组长参加；一种是辅导员在活动以后，将先走一步的结果，分别向小组长和互助组长传达和研究，并定期和不定期地听取小组长汇报，帮助他们解决学习上的问题。不管是采用那一种办法，都必须认识，培养骨干分子乃是一种很重要的工作，其目的就是使辅导工作中有得力的助手，通过他们去辅导其他学员。只有这样，才能使辅导工作有了根子，才可以克服辅导员的“单干”现象。
    第四、辅导工作必须注意理论联系实际。这就是说，一方面要使学员理解课文中心和主要问题，使学员从对问题不同的论点的争论中得到正确的认识，以及帮助解决学习中的疑难问题；另一方面要使学员将理论联系实际，加深对理论的理解，以及使学员掌握理论，运用正确的观点和方法去解决一些工作和思想的实际问题。
    第五、辅导方法要以启发诱导为主，辅导方式要灵活多样。目前，不少的辅导员都是采用“讲中心”“解答问题”等方法进行辅导，结果，学员反映：“辅导员讲的多，我们讲的少，好是好，就是不容易记得。”我们是采用互助漫谈、座谈会、抽查笔记、测验、举办笔记展览、组织联组讨论或课堂讨论，以及组织去工厂、农村、展览会实际参观等方法进行辅导。对水平较低的学员，个别单位也采用了一些其他的辅助办法（如按可能和需要上辅导课），帮助他们赶上进度，提高他们的理论兴趣。
