To support the masses in disaster areas to resume production and provide for themselves, the head office of the People's Bank of China has instructed its branches in disaster areas to strengthen loan work in disaster areas.

The instruction stated: Banks in disaster areas should regard assisting the masses in production for self-relief as the overriding central task for this winter and next spring. The main tasks are to issue production relief loans effectively, especially the 940 billion yuan special relief loan, and to develop and consolidate credit cooperative organizations. The instruction stated that in areas where conditions are suitable for developing credit cooperatives, active assistance should be given to the masses to organize credit cooperatives. Because it is relatively difficult for credit cooperatives in disaster areas to absorb deposits, banks should strengthen leadership and provide strong financial support to promote the consolidation of credit cooperatives, so that they can play an active role in production and disaster relief.

Regarding the source and use of loans in disaster areas, the instruction pointed out that in addition to the 940 billion yuan already allocated by the head office, attention should also be paid to regulating rural funds through credit cooperative organizations, tapping the potential of the masses, and organizing mutual assistance among the masses. The disaster relief loans allocated by the head office should be mainly placed in severely affected areas and used with emphasis to prevent even distribution. Autumn loans are mainly to solve the funds needed for purchasing wheat seeds, protecting livestock, fishing, and protecting autumn crops; winter loans are mainly to support farmers in various sideline productions and handicraft productions to increase income; next spring loans are mainly to support spring plowing production. Necessary loans should be given to help overcome the difficulties in the lives of some disaster victims, starting from the actual situation.

The instruction also pointed out that after farmers suffer from disasters, the strength and role of collective mutual assistance become even more important. Therefore, disaster area loans should pay special attention to supporting agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and encourage individual farmers to organize, increase production, increase income, overcome difficulties, and survive the famine through production.

The instruction also particularly emphasized that the issuance of disaster area loans should be combined with relief grain and funds, social mutual assistance, and other disaster relief measures under the unified leadership of the Party committees and governments. A comprehensive study and plan must be made in advance so that the role of agricultural loan funds can be fully utilized. When issuing loans, attention should also be paid to cooperating with the material supply work of state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives.

    人民银行总行指示各灾区分支机构
    加强灾区贷款工作扶持群众生产自救
    为扶持灾区群众生产自救，中国人民银行总行指示所属在灾区的分支机构加强灾区贷款工作。
    指示说：灾区的银行应以扶助群众生产自救作为今冬明春压倒一切的中心任务。主要工作是发放好生产救灾贷款，特别是发放好九千四百亿元专用救灾贷款，发展和巩固信用合作组织。指示说，在有条件发展信用合作社的地区，应积极帮助群众组织信用合作社。因为灾区信用合作社吸收存款比较困难，银行应加强领导并在资金上给以有力支持，促进信用合作社巩固起来，使它在生产救灾中发挥积极作用。
    关于灾区贷款的来源和使用，指示指出，除总行已拨款九千四百亿元外，还要注意通过信用合作组织，调剂农村资金，发掘群众潜力，组织群众间的互助互济。总行所拨的救灾贷款主要放在重灾区，并有重点地使用，防止平均分配。秋季贷款主要是解决购买麦种、保畜、捕鱼及保秋等所需要的资金；冬季主要是扶持农民进行各种副业生产和手工业生产，以增加收益；明春主要是支持春耕生产。对于部分灾民生活中的困难，要从实际出发，给予必要的贷款，帮助克服。
    指示又指出，农民遭受灾害以后，集体互助的力量和作用更加显得重要。因此，灾区贷款要特别注意扶持农业生产互助合作组织，并鼓励个体农民组织起来，增加生产，增加收入，克服困难，生产渡荒。
    指示还特别强调灾区贷款的发放，应在党委和政府统一领导下，和救济粮款、社会互济等各项救灾措施结合起来，事先必须作通盘研究和计划，这样才能充分发挥农贷资金的作用。在发放贷款时还要注意和国营商业、供销合作社的物资供应工作配合起来。
