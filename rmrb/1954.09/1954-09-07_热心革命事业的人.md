	A Person Devoted to the Revolutionary Cause
	Shan Shengjun
	In the hall of the First Session of the First People's Congress of Shaanxi Province sat a people's representative, dressed in blue, with a white towel wrapped around her head, her face appearing very kind. She was Yan Lai'ai, an elderly woman and deputy township head of the Second Township of the Second District of Shenmu County. To carry on her husband's revolutionary legacy, she had actively responded to the call of the Party in Shenmu County, an old revolutionary base area with nearly twenty years of revolutionary history, mobilizing the masses to produce and overcome the economic difficulties of the liberated areas at that time. During the Liberation War, she also sacrificed her son. For more than a decade, Yan Lai'ai has been a people's representative and labor model in Wangjia Village, Second Township, and has been sincerely supported and loved by the masses of the Second Township.
	Yan Lai'ai's family was originally poor peasants. Around 1935, when the Red Army was fighting the enemy and carrying out land reform in the Shenmu area, Yan Lai'ai's family obtained land and truly turned over. Her husband, Wang Yuxi, was a traditional Chinese medicine doctor. At that time, he realized that the Communist Party was of one heart with the poor, so he left home to join the revolutionary ranks. From then on, Yan Lai'ai became a glorious revolutionary military family member, and her enthusiasm for fighting the enemy became even higher. During the Anti-Japanese War, once when the enemy was twenty or thirty miles away from Wangjia Village, Yan Lai'ai, without considering the difficulties of her pregnancy, led the women to stand guard at the entrance of the village. Later, Yan Lai'ai gave birth and was "confined to her bed" for postpartum care. Normally, it's best for women not to move around during this time, but it coincided with wounded soldiers from the front lines arriving. Yan Lai'ai disregarded her own health and diligently served seven or eight wounded soldiers in her home, cooking rice and boiling water for them. There was a seriously wounded soldier, and Yan Lai'ai cooked dates and made rice cakes for him, and even slaughtered her own pig to make noodle soup with pork to feed him. At this time, her husband was also treating wounded soldiers day and night in the army, his eyes bloodshot, saving many soldiers, but in the end, he died of illness himself. Yan Lai'ai was very sad at this time, but seeing that her husband had died for the revolution, she was even more determined to carry the revolution through to the end.
	In 1943, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang blockaded the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. At that time, the people in the old liberated areas had great difficulties with food and clothing. Cotton and cloth from outside could not get in, and not many people in the liberated areas knew how to grow cotton and spin thread. Under such extremely difficult circumstances, Chairman Mao called on the people of the border region to engage in production, grow cotton and spin thread themselves, and solve their own food and clothing problems. Yan Lai'ai actively responded to this call from the Party, fully realizing that only by responding to this call could they achieve self-reliance through production. However, at that time, no one in her village had ever grown cotton, and no one knew how to spin thread. Some women lacked confidence and were difficult to mobilize. Yan Lai'ai was the chairman of the peasants' association and the women's director in the village at that time. Therefore, with the support of the township and village governments, she convened meetings of the villagers to repeatedly promote the benefits of growing cotton. After the meeting, she bought a spinning wheel herself and took the lead in spinning thread, and also asked her eldest daughter to teach other women to spin thread. Under her leadership and propaganda, all the women in the village were mobilized and several textile groups were established. A year later, almost all of the more than eighty households in the village had spinning wheels, and every family planted cotton. This not only solved the problem of clothing for the masses in Wangjia Village at that time, but also supported the struggle against the enemy. In 1947, when the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang attacked Yan'an, Yan Lai'ai unhesitatingly encouraged her eldest son to join the People's Liberation Army. Her son suffered serious lung damage while fighting the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army in Baoji, and eventually died of lung failure in 1952. Yan Lai'ai was so heartbroken at this time that she couldn't cry, but from then on, she became even more determined in her revolutionary will. She vowed: "I must continue the unfinished cause of my husband and son, and carry the revolution through to the end!"
	After the liberation of the mainland, Yan Lai'ai still maintained an excellent revolutionary style in Wangjia Village, not arrogant or complacent, and humbly connected with the masses. In 1953, she participated in the agricultural mutual aid group. Although she was old, she always took the lead in production, going to the fields at the crack of dawn. Her two daughters are both revolutionary cadres, and sometimes send her some money. Some women said to her: You're old, take it easy, your two daughters won't forget you. But she thought that she was the women's director of the village and township, and also a Communist Party member. How could she not take the lead in production? She replied: "It won't do not to work!" Usually, there were lax phenomena in the mutual aid group, and individual Party members did not play a leading role. Yan Lai'ai was the leader of the Party group, and she often criticized this situation at Party group meetings. She said: "Can we Party members not walk in front of the masses? If we want to do a good job in the mutual aid group, we must be the backbone and lead everyone towards a socialist society." Last year, when the People's Government implemented the unified purchase and sale of grain, although she did not have a surplus of rice, she still voluntarily sold five dou of black beans. In 1952, the township women's federation held a meeting and decided to organize literacy groups in various villages. Yan Lai'ai quickly conveyed the resolution to the masses, and personally cooperated with district and township cadres to run to five villages to mobilize them. Later, the masses gradually participated in literacy classes. Because Yan Lai'ai has been enthusiastically serving the masses for more than ten years and has demonstrated the strong will of women, she was elected as the deputy township head of the Second Township in the general election this year, and then elected as a representative to the First People's Congress of Shaanxi Province.

    热心革命事业的人
    单圣浚
    在陕西省第一届人民代表大会第一次会议的会场里，坐着一位身着蓝衣、头披白毛巾、面容显得非常慈祥的人民代表，她是神木县二区二乡副乡长阎来爱老大娘。为了继承丈夫的革命遗志，她曾在神木县这个有近二十年革命历史的老根据地，积极响应党的号召，发动群众生产，战胜当时解放区在经济上的困难。在解放战争期间，她还献出了自己的儿子。十几年来，阎来爱一直是二乡王家庄的人民代表和劳动模范，一直受着二乡群众热诚的拥护和爱戴。
    阎来爱家原是贫农，一九三五年前后红军在神木一带打敌人、进行土地革命的时候，阎来爱家才有了地，真正翻了身。她丈夫王玉玺是个中医，那时认识了共产党和穷人是一条心，就离开家参加了革命队伍。从此阎来爱成了光荣的革命军属，对敌斗争的情绪更加高涨。在抗日战争时期，有一次敌人离王家庄二、三十里远，阎来爱没有考虑到自己怀孕的困难，就带动妇女到村头去放哨；后来阎来爱生产了，正“坐月子”，按说一般妇女在月子里最好不要走动，但这时正碰上前线下来了人民军队的伤病员，阎来爱不顾自己的身体，就在家里殷勤地服侍了七、八个伤病员，给他们煮饭烧水。伤员中有个重伤员，阎来爱就煮上枣子、做米馍给他吃，还杀了自己的猪，用猪肉汤煮面条喂他。这时她丈夫在军队里也不分昼夜地给伤病员治病，两个眼睛熬得通红，救出了许多的战士，但最后他自己病死了。这时阎来爱十分难过，但他看到自己丈夫是为革命而死的，更下定决心要革命到底。
    一九四三年，蒋匪帮封锁陕甘宁边区，那时老解放区人民吃穿都很困难，外地的棉花和布进不来，解放区人民又没有很多人会种棉花和纺线。在这样极端困难的情况下，毛主席号召边区人民搞生产，自己种花纺线，解决自己的衣食问题。阎来爱积极响应了党的这一号召，她充分认识到只有响应这个号召，才能生产自救。但那时她村里没有人种过棉花，也没人会纺线，一部分妇女信心不足，难于发动。阎来爱这时是村里的农会会长，又是妇女主任，所以在当时乡、村政府的支持下，她就召集村里的群众开会，再三宣传种棉花的好处。会后，她自己买了纺线车带头纺线，还叫她大女儿教给其他妇女纺线。在她的带头和宣传下，全庄的妇女都发动起来了，成立了几个纺织小组。一年以后，全村八十多户人家，差不多都有了纺线车，家家都种上了棉花，这样不但解决了当时王家庄群众穿衣的困难，还支援了对敌的斗争。一九四七年，蒋匪帮进攻延安时，阎来爱毫不迟疑地鼓励自己的大儿子参加了解放军；她儿子在打宝鸡的蒋匪军时，因为奋勇作战，肺部受了严重的影响，到一九五二年终因肺部溃烂不治而死了。阎来爱这时伤心得哭不出声来，但从此她更坚定了革命的意志，她发誓说：“我一定要继续丈夫和儿子未完的事业，革命到底！”
    全国大陆解放以后，阎来爱在王家庄仍旧保持了优良的革命作风，不骄不傲，虚心联系群众。一九五三年她参加了农业互助组，年纪虽然大了，但她始终带头生产，天一亮就下地。她的两个女儿都是革命干部，有时寄点钱给她。有些妇女就对她说：老了少干点吧，你两个女儿忘不了你。但她想到自己是村和乡里的妇女主任，又是个共产党员，不带头生产怎么行呢？她回答说：“不劳动不行！”平常互助组里有散漫现象，个别党员也不起带头作用，阎来爱是党的小组长，就针对这种情况在党的小组会上经常提出批评。她说：“我们党员不走在群众的前面能行吗？要想把互助组搞好，我们就得作骨干，带动大家走向社会主义社会。”去年人民政府实行粮食统购统销时，她虽然在谷米上没有多余，但也自动卖出了五斗黑豆。一九五二年乡妇联开会决定在各村组织识字组，阎来爱就赶紧把决议传达给群众，还亲自配合区、乡干部跑到五个村子里作了动员，以后群众就都渐渐地参加识字班了。由于十几年来阎来爱一直热情为群众办事，表现了妇女坚强的意志，今年在普选中她当选为二乡副乡长，接着又当选为陕西省第一届人民代表大会代表。
