    China Peace Committee Cables All-India Peace Council
    Congratulating Indian People on Holding "Asian People's Solidarity Month" Campaign
    [Xinhua News Agency, 21st] The China People's Committee for World Peace cabled the All-India Peace Council, congratulating the Indian people on holding the "Asian People's Solidarity Month" campaign. The cable reads as follows: All-India Peace Council:

    As the Indian people hold the "Asian People's Solidarity Month" campaign, we, on behalf of the Chinese people, express our heartfelt congratulations to the All-India Peace Council and the Indian people.

    The Asian people are peace-loving. The joint statements issued separately by the Prime Ministers of China and India, and the Prime Ministers of China and Burma, mark a further development of the unity and cooperation of the Asian people in the cause of peace. The Five Principles proposed in the statement are the basis for peaceful coexistence among Asian countries. However, the American aggressor bloc, fearing the strengthening of the Asian people's unity in the cause of peace, is always unwilling to accept its defeat. Recently, it organized the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" military bloc in an attempt to undermine the Geneva Accords and continue to pursue its aggressive war policy of splitting Asia and "using Asians to fight Asians." This is incompatible with the interests and wishes of the Asian people. The Chinese people are willing to work together with the people of India and other Asian countries to oppose the establishment of military aggression blocs by the United States, to implement the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and to establish collective peace in Asia.

    We wish the Indian people's "Asian People's Solidarity Month" campaign a great success, and wish the friendly unity between the Chinese and Indian people, and among the Asian people, will be increasingly consolidated and developed.

    China People's Committee for World Peace

    我保卫世界和平委员会致电全印和平理事会
    祝贺印度人民举行“亚洲人民团结月”运动
    【新华社二十一日讯】中国人民保卫世界和平委员会致电全印和平理事会，祝贺印度人民举行“亚洲人民团结月”运动。电文如下：全印和平理事会：
    兹值印度人民举行“亚洲人民团结月”运动，我们代表中国人民向全印和平理事会及印度人民表示衷心的祝贺。
    亚洲人民是爱好和平的。中印两国总理、中缅两国总理分别发表的联合声明标志着亚洲各国人民在和平事业中团结合作的进一步发展，声明中提出的五项原则是亚洲各国和平共处的基础。然而，害怕亚洲人民在和平事业中加强团结的美国侵略集团始终不甘心于他们的失败，最近组织了“东南亚集体防务条约”军事集团，企图破坏日内瓦协议，继续推行分裂亚洲、“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的侵略战争政策。这是与亚洲人民的利益和愿望不相容的。中国人民愿与印度和亚洲各国人民为反对美国建立军事侵略集团，为贯彻和平共处的五项原则和建立亚洲的集体和平而共同努力。
    谨祝印度人民“亚洲人民团结月”运动获得重大成就，并祝中印两国人民以及亚洲人民友好团结日益巩固和发展。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会
    一九五四年九月二十日
