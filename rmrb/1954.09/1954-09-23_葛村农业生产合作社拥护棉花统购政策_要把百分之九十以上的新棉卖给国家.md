    Ge Village Agricultural Production Cooperative Supports the Unified Purchase Policy for Cotton; To Sell More Than Ninety Percent of the New Cotton to the State
    The cotton in the Ge Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shahe County, Hebei Province, is growing very well. They originally planned to harvest 148,500 jin of cotton from 1,200 mu of land; recently, in response to the call for over-fulfilling production, they strengthened the late-stage management of the cotton fields, promoting early maturity of the cotton. This will allow them to harvest more white cotton before the frost and reduce red cotton after the frost, and further increase cotton production by 11,300 jin. They actively support the unified purchase policy for cotton, deciding to keep only a small portion of cotton for their own use and sell the remaining 145,000+ jin of cotton to the state, accounting for more than 90% of the cooperative's total cotton production. This autumn, Hebei Province newly established ten tractor stations in cotton-producing areas, one of which is located in Ge Village. When autumn plowing begins, the tractors will plow the land for the agricultural production cooperative. This will help them increase production even more and reduce much heavy labor. To contribute even greater efforts to support national industrialization, the farmers of the entire cooperative are even more enthusiastic about production. To lay the foundation for next year's wheat harvest, they have accumulated 5,372,000 jin of soil fertilizer, enough to apply more than 5,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu of wheat field; the cooperative has also raised 189 fat pigs. The agricultural production cooperative has also expanded further; of the 238 households in the entire village, all except for four rich peasant households have joined the cooperative.

    葛村农业生产合作社拥护棉花统购政策
    要把百分之九十以上的新棉卖给国家
    河北省沙河县葛村农业生产合作社的棉花长得很好。他们原计划在一千二百亩地里收获十四万八千五百斤棉花；最近响应超额增产的号召，又加强了棉田后期管理，促使棉花早熟；这样可以多收霜前白花，减少霜后红花，并且可以再增产棉花一万一千三百斤。他们积极支持棉花统购的政策，决定只留很少一部分自用棉，把余下的十四万五千多斤棉花全部卖给国家，占全社棉花总产量的百分之九十以上。河北省今年秋天在棉产区新建立了十个拖拉机站，其中一个就设在葛村。秋耕开始时，拖拉机就要给农业生产合作社耕地。这将会帮助他们更多地增加生产，而且要使他们减少许多繁重的劳动。全社农民为了尽更大力量支持国家工业化，生产情绪更高了。为了给明年麦子的丰收打下基础，已积土肥五百三十七万二千斤，每亩麦田能施底肥五千多斤；全社还养了一百八十九口肥猪。农业生产合作社也更扩大了，全村二百三十八户，除了四户富农以外，已经全部入社。
