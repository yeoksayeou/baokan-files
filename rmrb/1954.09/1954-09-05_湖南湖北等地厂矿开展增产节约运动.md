Factories and Mines in Hunan, Hubei and Other Places Launch Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign

Factories and mines in Hunan, Hubei, Shanghai and other places are launching an increase production and practice economy campaign.

Local state-owned industries in Hunan have formulated a plan for increasing production and practicing economy for the second half of this year based on production and sales conditions. According to statistics from only 52 units, the total value of increased production and savings will reach more than 110 billion yuan. The pig iron produced can be used to cast more than 500,000 hoes weighing two kilograms each. All units also pay special attention to saving the consumption of agricultural products. Eleven rice mills in Changsha City have taken effective measures to increase the rice yield, and can produce more than 710,000 catties of rice in the second half of the year. According to statistics from 23 factories in the city, more than 122,000 catties of rice can be saved in the second half of this year. All cotton textile factories are also trying to save raw cotton. Yuxiang Textile Factory alone plans to save more than 46,000 catties of cotton in the second half of the year.

The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held a Hubei Provincial Local Industry Conference, mobilizing all employees to strive for an estimated plan to increase production and practice economy by 10% on the basis of the original production plan in 1954, in order to ensure the smooth progress of industrial construction and support the recovery and development of agricultural production.

In order to further promote the increase production and practice economy campaign, Li Ze, Deputy Minister of the Provincial Party Committee Industry Department, pointed out that local state-owned industries must correctly grasp the policy of serving national construction, increasing agricultural production in non-disaster areas, helping disaster areas to help themselves, and serving the lives of urban and rural people under the general requirements of national construction; conscientiously carry out ideological mobilization work and establish the strong confidence of employees in increasing production and practicing economy; and formulate plans for increasing production and practicing economy at all levels and rapidly on the basis of the employees' consciousness; further strengthen the factory's production management and the political and ideological leadership of employees; and conscientiously do a good job in the supply, transportation and product sales of raw materials according to the new situation in rural areas. Party committees and governments at all levels must strengthen their leadership over the local state-owned industry increase production and practice economy campaign.

State-owned and joint state-private iron and steel plants in Shanghai have formulated plans for increasing production in the second half of this year. The increase production plan decides to increase the country's wealth (total value) by more than 290 billion yuan; steel production should increase by 6.66% compared with the state plan this year; and steel production should increase by 19.6%. The formulation of the increase production plan of each factory is generally proposed by the employee representative assembly, and then the representatives return to the workshop to widely convey and organize discussions. During the discussion, the workers were very enthusiastic and expressed that they would guarantee the completion of the increase production task without increasing manpower or adding machinery and equipment.

    湖南湖北等地厂矿开展增产节约运动
    湖南、湖北和上海等地工厂矿山开展增产节约运动。
    湖南地方国营工业已根据产销情况，订出今年下半年增产节约计划。仅据五十二个单位的统计，增产节约总值即达一千一百多亿元。用增产的生铁可以铸成两公斤重的锄头五十多万把。各单位还特别注意节约农产品的消耗。长沙市十一家米厂采取有效措施提高出米率，下半年可多出米七十一万多斤。另据该市二十三个工厂的统计，今年下半年能节省十二万二千多斤大米。各棉纺织厂也在想办法节约原棉，仅裕湘纺织厂下半年计划节约的棉花就有四万六千多斤。
    中共湖北省委最近召开湖北省地方工业会议，动员全体职工为保证工业建设的顺利进行、支援农业生产的恢复和发展，在一九五四年原生产计划的基础上，再增产节约百分之十的预计计划而奋斗。
    为了深入开展增产节约运动，省委工业部副部长李泽指出：地方国营工业必须在国家建设的总要求下，正确地掌握为国家建设、为非灾区的农业增产、灾区生产自救和为城乡人民生活服务的方针，认真作好思想动员工作，树立职工增产节约的坚强信心；在职工自觉的基础上，逐级、迅速地订出增产节约计划；进一步加强工厂的生产管理和职工的政治思想领导；根据农村新的情况，认真作好原材料供应、运输、产品推销工作。各级党委和政府必须加强对地方国营工业增产节约运动的领导。
    上海各国营、公私合营的钢铁厂订出了今年下半年的增产计划。增产计划中决定要为国家增产二千九百余亿元的财富（总值）；钢的产量要比今年的国家计划增加百分之六点六六；钢材的产量要增加百分之十九点六。各厂增产计划的制订，一般都由职工代表大会提出，然后由代表回车间广泛传达，组织讨论。在讨论中，工人们的热情很高，纷纷表示：在不增加人力、不增加机器设备的情况下，保证完成增产任务。
