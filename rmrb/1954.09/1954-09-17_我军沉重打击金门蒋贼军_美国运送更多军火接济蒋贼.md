Xinhua News Agency, 15th - After the Chiang bandit troops entrenched on Kinmen Island off the Fujian coast suffered a heavy blow from the artillery units of the People's Liberation Army, the US authorities are transporting more military aid to Taiwan to support the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

According to Western news agencies, the US Joint Chiefs of Staff have issued orders to provide the Chiang Kai-shek bandits with "full logistical support." A US Department of Defense spokesman openly announced on the 14th that US military aid was being transported to Taiwan in large quantities "continuously." The spokesman also stated that US military aid to the Chiang bandits "has expanded to include almost all standard weapons in the US arsenal." US Navy officials also revealed on the 14th that the US authorities "may" dispatch ships to help the Chiang bandits transport weapons and military supplies from Taiwan to Kinmen.

Reports indicate that the US military aid advisory group in Taiwan has been expanded to 900 people in order to implement the plan to expand aid to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. On the 11th, Chase, the head of the military aid advisory group, rushed to Kinmen to hold secret meetings with local Chiang bandit military leaders and inspect the Chiang bandit troops. At the same time, according to Reuters, Chase and senior officers of the advisory group held a series of meetings, deciding to establish a logistics station in Kinmen and dispatch some American officers there.

    我军沉重打击金门蒋贼军
    美国运送更多军火接济蒋贼
    【新华社十五日讯】在盘踞福建沿海金门岛上的蒋贼军遭到人民解放军炮兵部队的沉重打击后，美国当局正在把更多的军事援助运到台湾去，支持蒋介石卖国集团。
    据西方通讯社报道，美国参谋长联席会议已发出命令，给予蒋匪帮“充分的后勤支援”。美国国防部发言人十四日公开宣布，美国的军事援助正在“不断地”大量运送到台湾去。发言人还表示，美国对蒋匪的军事援助“已经扩大到几乎包括美国军火库中的所有标准武器”。美国海军官员们十四日还透露，美国当局“可能”会派遣船只帮助蒋匪把武器军火从台湾运到金门去。
    有消息说，美国驻台湾的军事援助顾问团为了执行扩大援助蒋匪帮的计划，已扩充到九百人之多。军事援助顾问团团长蔡斯在十一日还赶到金门去，和当地蒋贼军头目举行了秘密会议，并视察了蒋贼军。同时，据路透社报道，蔡斯和顾问团的高级军官们举行了一系列的会议，决定在金门设立一个后勤站，并且派遣一部分美国军官去。
