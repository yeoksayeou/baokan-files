    Chongqing Public-Private Joint Venture 610 Textile and Dyeing Factory
    Expanded into the Largest Textile and Dyeing Integrated Factory in Southwest China
    The Chongqing Public-Private Joint Venture 610 Textile and Dyeing Factory began its expansion in 1952. Over the past two years, it has newly built a cloth factory and a dyeing factory, and has now become the largest textile and dyeing integrated factory in Southwest China. Now, the 610 Textile and Dyeing Factory not only produces thousands of yarn pieces every month, but also produces tens of thousands of white cloth pieces and tens of thousands of colored cloth pieces to supply the people of Southwest China.
    In the past, when the 610 Textile and Dyeing Factory had not expanded its weaving and dyeing equipment, the yarn produced, in addition to supplying the needs of hand-woven cloth in Southwest China, mostly had to be transported to textile factories in Central South, East China, and North China to be woven into cloth and then transported back to Southwest China. Now, it spins and weaves its own cloth, which not only saves a large number of transportation tools and freight, but also shortens the production process. The yarn tubes come directly from the spinning room to the preparation workshop of the cloth field, eliminating the processes of reeling and packing, saving an average of 198,000 yuan in wages and material costs per yarn piece.

### 重庆公私合营六一零纺织染厂  扩建成西南最大的纺织染联合工厂

    重庆公私合营六一零纺织染厂
    扩建成西南最大的纺织染联合工厂
    重庆公私合营六一零纺织染厂，从一九五二年起开始扩建，两年来新建了布厂和染厂，现在已成为西南最大的纺织染联合工厂了。现在六一零纺织染厂每月不仅生产几千件纱，而且生产几万匹白布和几万匹色布供应西南人民。
    六一零纺织染厂过去在没有扩大织染设备时，生产的纱除了供应西南手工业织布需要以外，绝大部分要运到中南、华东和华北等地的纺织工厂织成布匹再运回西南。现在自纺自织，不但节约了大量的运输工具和运杂费，而且生产过程也缩短了。纱管从细纱间出来就直接送到布场的准备车间，免除了摇纱和打包等工序，平均每件纱能节省工资和物料费十九万八千多元。
