At night, people flocked to Tiananmen Square to sing and dance to their heart's content.

Jurist and professor of Renmin University of China, He Sijing, expressed his feelings about the promulgation of the Constitution: The Constitution makes me feel particularly kind and lovely.

Wang Jiamo, a teacher in the Department of Industrial Economics who recently won the first-class prize for special papers awarded by Renmin University of China, said excitedly: The Constitution is the greatest encouragement to those of us who are engaged in education and scientific research. In the future, I must work harder to improve my scientific and teaching level and dedicate all my strength to the cause of socialist construction.
