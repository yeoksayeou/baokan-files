Flood Control Projects on Rivers in North China Play a Flood Prevention Role
　　Tianjin Initially Overcomes the Threat of Floods
　　Since June, North China has experienced widespread heavy rainfall. The rainfall in Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Cangxian, and other areas in July this year exceeded the highest historical rainfall in July by 16 to 75 percent. Several floods occurred successively in various rivers. For example, the flow at Beiguocun on the Zhulong River exceeded the guaranteed flow by 2.5 times; the flow at Huangbizhuang on the Hutuo River also exceeded the guaranteed flow by more than one time; the water level at Shifangyuan on Baiyangdian exceeded the highest historical flood level by 0.42 meters. Consequently, Tianjin, located at the lower reaches of various rivers, experienced a continuous rise in water levels in August, and flood prevention work entered a tense stage. The single-outlet Hai River flood diversion project, completed last year and previously used, was opened again on July 13th to discharge floodwater. The original plan was to divert 1020 cubic meters per second, but in August, the project exceeded the plan by diverting floodwater at a rate of 1279 cubic meters per second. Even so, because the inflow from the upper reaches of various rivers was large, the water level in Tianjin continued to rise sharply. On August 21st, the water level at Yangliuqing on the Ziya River reached 8.16 meters, exceeding the highest water level in 1939 by 0.33 meters. On August 20th, the water level at Jintang Bridge on the Hai River reached 5.83 meters, close to the highest water level in 1939 (6.01 meters). However, in 1939, the dikes had already collapsed before the water level at Yangliuqing reached 7.83 meters. The floods in 1939 had submerged Tianjin, with water depths in the urban area reaching several meters, and the Jinpu and Jingshan railways were also washed away. This year, due to the Hai River flood diversion project diverting the floodwaters of the Daqing River and the Ziya River, the Guanting Reservoir retaining the floodwaters of the Yongding River, and the flood control projects carried out on various rivers over the years also played a role, coupled with the organization of the masses in Tianjin to raise the main dikes throughout the city by 0.5 to 1 meter according to the 1939 flood standard, reinforcing the northern dike of the Hai River flood diversion project and the right dike of the Ziya River, and preparing a large number of flood prevention materials for timely rescue of dangerous spots, the safety of Tianjin was still protected despite the tense situation of high water levels. Currently, the dangerous stage in Tianjin has been initially overcome, and the water levels of various rivers have stabilized. The people of the Tianjin Special District of Hebei Province and Tianjin are raising their vigilance, guarding strictly, and preparing to finally overcome the floods.

    华北各河治理工程发挥了防洪作用
    天津市初步战胜洪水威胁
    华北各地自六月以来普降大雨，石家庄、保定、沧县等地今年七月份的降雨量，超过历年七月份最高降雨量百分之十六到百分之七十五，各河连续发生多次洪水，如潴龙河北郭村曾超过保证流量的二·五倍；滹沱河黄壁庄亦超过保证流量的一倍以上；白洋淀十方院的水位超过历年最高洪水位○·四二公尺；因此处于各河尾闾的天津，八月份水位不断上涨，防汛工作进入了紧张阶段。去年完工并曾使用过的独流入海减河工程，在今年七月十三日又开闸泄洪，该减河原计划泄洪一○二○秒公方，今年八月份超计划地分泄洪水曾达一二七九秒公方。即使如此，但因各河上游来量均大，天津水位涨势仍猛，八月二十一日，子牙河杨柳青的水位曾涨达八·一六公尺，超过一九三九年最高水位○·三三公尺，海河金汤桥水位八月二十日达五·八三公尺，接近一九三九年最高水位（六·○一公尺）。但一九三九年在杨柳青水位到达七·八三公尺前，堤防即已溃决。一九三九年的洪水曾将天津淹没，市区水深数公尺，津浦、京山铁路亦被大水冲断。今年由于独流减河分泄了大清河、子牙河的洪水，官厅水库拦蓄了永定河的洪水，历年来对各河的治理也发挥了作用，加以天津市组织群众将全市主要堤防按一九三九年洪水标准加高了○·五至一公尺，加固了独流减河北堤和子牙河右堤，并准备了大批防汛器材，随时抢护险工，虽在高水位的紧张情况下，仍然保卫着天津市的安全。目前天津市的危险阶段已初步渡过，各河水位已经稳住，河北省天津专区及天津市人民正提高警惕，严密防守，准备最后战胜洪水。
