Greeting the Great Joy of the People of the Whole Country
– A Conversation with Yue Shangwu, Driver of the "Mao Zedong" Locomotive
    Pei Da

    Let me start with the happiest day.

    August 21st was the most exciting day for the people of the whole country. On that day, the Beijing Municipal People's Congress elected our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao as a representative to the National People's Congress. On this day, we comrades of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive crew felt especially happy, because our two former drivers—Li Yong (currently Director of the Financial Review Committee of the China Railway Trade Union) and Guo Shude (Deputy Chief of the Fengtai Railway Branch's Locomotive Depot)—were also elected as representatives to the National People's Congress. It was also on this day that our locomotive safely reached 600,000 kilometers and was welcomed by the workers upon returning to the depot. Afterwards, we also participated in the celebration meeting for Chairman Mao's election. How glorious and happy this is!

    When we are happiest, we often recall the past and see what we have done for the people.

    Under the inspiration of its glorious title, our "Mao Zedong" locomotive has completed the tasks assigned to us by the Party and the people. Eight years ago, this locomotive was abandoned at a station near Harbin and was badly damaged. After liberation, our workers repaired it. From Northeast China to inside the Shanhaiguan Pass, it has safely traveled 600,000 kilometers; from pulling 2,000 tons to 2,500 tons, it has reached 5,400 tons; in 1949, it burned six tons of coal a day, but now it only burns three tons. When Comrade Li Yong was the driver, he often said to us: "We have become masters of the country, and the locomotive is our life; we must cherish it as we cherish our own pocket watch!" After Li Yong left the locomotive, Comrade Guo Shude used the same words to educate us. We put forward the slogan "Burning coal is like managing a household, we must be careful and thrifty." Once, we pulled 4,000 tons of coal back from Nancang, and we shoveled the coal into the boiler one scoop at a time, totaling 4,100 scoops. We calculated that if we added two ounces less coal per scoop, and ran 60 trips a month, we could save more than 20 tons of coal. So we replaced the large shovel with a small one, which did not hinder steam generation, and saved effort and coal. Last year alone, we saved more than 360 tons of coal. The Party teaches us and the people hope that we workers will run ahead like locomotives, and we have done it. Now our "Mao Zedong" locomotive is bravely advancing towards the goal of safely traveling one million kilometers!

    The goal of safely traveling one million kilometers can definitely be achieved. Because the promulgation of the draft constitution has given us even more strength. This draft constitution embodies the will of our working class and the will of the people of the whole country. How can it not be encouraging! We workers have studied and discussed the draft constitution clause by clause. We feel the glory and importance of the working class's responsibility during the country's transition period. From the day we started studying the draft constitution, we have been considering our work in accordance with its spirit. In particular, we have acted in accordance with the provisions in Articles 100 and 101: "Citizens of the People's Republic of China must… observe labor discipline…" "…cherish and protect public property…" For example, recently there has been a lot of rain, so we coated the locomotive with oil to prevent it from rusting, and when the weather cleared, we wiped the oil off again. We are trying our best to improve the quality of the locomotive and extend its service life. We guarantee that we will burn coal even more sparingly.

    The first session of the National People's Congress is about to be convened. At this meeting, our country's first constitution will be solemnly adopted. We will use practical actions to welcome the arrival of this great happy event for the people of the whole country. We will safely welcome and send off the people's representatives, ensure that the train is not late and does not exceed the speed limit, and let the people's representatives sit on the train comfortably and happily. We will further promote the competition of excellent locomotive crews. The comrades said: We must make new and greater achievements to present as a gift to the National People's Congress meeting!

    Our comrades-in-arms, superiors, and representatives—Comrades Li Yong and Guo Shude—came to see us in our group before attending the National People's Congress meeting. They said: "Comrades! We must prevent pride, learn humbly, unite well, and better complete our tasks." This is an affectionate exhortation, a solemn instruction, and the hope of the people of the whole country, because they are representatives of the National People's Congress! We guarantee that we will definitely be able to do it, and at the same time, we hope that they will bring our wishes—the determination to build socialism and liberate Taiwan—to Beijing.

### 迎接全国人民的大喜事  ——“毛泽东号”机车司机长岳尚武的谈话

    迎接全国人民的大喜事
    ——“毛泽东号”机车司机长岳尚武的谈话
    裴达
    让我从最高兴的一天谈起吧。
    八月二十一日是全国人民最兴奋的一天，这一天北京市人民代表大会选举我们最亲爱的伟大领袖毛主席为全国人民代表大会的代表。这一天，我们“毛泽东号”机车包车组的同志们格外感到高兴，因为我们两位前任司机长——李永（现任中国铁路工会经费审查委员会主任委员）和郭树德（丰台铁路分局机务段副段长），也都当选为全国人民代表大会的代表。也就是在这一天，正好我们的机车安全行走到六十万公里，回段时受到职工们的欢迎。接着我们又参加了庆祝毛主席当选的大会。这是多么光荣和快乐啊！
    我们最高兴的时候，常常要回忆一下过去，看看我们为人民做了些什么。
    我们“毛泽东号”机车在光荣的称号鼓舞下，完成了党和人民交给我们的任务。八年前，这台机车被扔在哈尔滨附近的车站上，破损得很厉害，解放后经我们工人的手把它修好了。从东北到关内，它已经安全地行走了六十万公里；从拉二千吨到二千五百吨，一直达到五千四百吨；一九四九年一天要烧煤六吨，现在只烧三吨煤就够了。李永同志担任司机长的时候，经常对我们说：“我们成了国家的主人，机车就是我们的生命；要像爱护自己的怀表那样爱护它！”李永离开机车，郭树德同志又用同样的话教育我们。我们提出了“烧煤好比过日子，要精打细算”的口号。有一次我们从南仓拉回来四千吨煤，我们一锹一锹地数着往锅炉里投煤，共投了四千一百次。我们盘算：如果每锹少添二两煤，每月跑六十趟，便可省煤二十多吨。于是我们把大锹换成小锹，既不妨碍蒸汽升腾，又省力、省煤。去年一年我们就省煤三百六十多吨。党教导我们、人民希望我们工人像火车头一样跑在前边，我们做到了。现在我们“毛泽东号”机车正向安全行走一百万公里的目标奋勇前进！
    安全行走一百万公里的目标是一定能够达到的。因为宪法草案的公布又给我们增加了力量。这个宪法草案表现了我们工人阶级的意志和全国人民的意志，怎么不令人欢欣鼓舞呢！我们工人逐条逐句地学习和讨论了宪法草案。我们感到了工人阶级在国家过渡时期的责任的光荣和重大。我们从学习宪法草案的那一天起，就按照它的精神来考虑我们的工作。特别是按第一百条和第一百零一条里的规定：“中华人民共和国公民必须……遵守劳动纪律，……”“……爱护和保卫公共财产……”去行动了。如最近雨多，我们把机车涂上油，不让它生锈，天晴了又把油擦下去；我们想尽办法提高机车质量，延长机车使用年限；我们保证烧煤更加节省。
    全国人民代表大会第一次会议就要召开了。在这个大会上，将庄严地通过我国第一个宪法。我们用实际行动迎接这个全国人民的大喜事的到来。我们要安全地迎送人民的代表，保证列车不晚点不超速，让人民的代表坐在火车上舒适而愉快。我们要把优秀机车包车组竞赛推进一步。同志们说：一定要做出新的更大的成就，向全国人民代表大会会议献礼！
    我们的战友、上级和代表——李永和郭树德同志，在出席全国人民代表大会会议以前，到我们组里来看我们。他们说：“同志们！我们要防止骄傲，虚心学习，团结好，更好地完成任务。”这是亲切的嘱咐，严肃的指示，又是全国人民的希望，因为他们是全国人民代表大会的代表呀！我们保证一定能做到，同时我们也希望他们把我们的心愿——建设社会主义、解放台湾的决心，带到北京去。
