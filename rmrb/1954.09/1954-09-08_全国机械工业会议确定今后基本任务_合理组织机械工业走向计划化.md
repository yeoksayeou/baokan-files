    Xinhua News Agency, 7th. The First Ministry of Machine Building of the Central People's Government recently convened a National Mechanical Engineering Conference. This conference was convened under the guidance of the State Planning Commission of the Central People's Government. The conference decided to gradually incorporate the national mechanical engineering industry into the orbit of the national plan, in order to overcome some of the blind development phenomena existing in the local mechanical engineering industries, and to give fuller play to the potential capabilities of the mechanical engineering industry.

    The conference first made a comprehensive study and analysis of the characteristics and current situation of China's mechanical engineering industry. The conference pointed out that since liberation, China's mechanical engineering industry has developed rapidly, and in recent years, it is gradually changing from the semi-colonial and semi-feudal nature of repair and assembly industry before liberation to an independent machine manufacturing industry. However, since this development was not carried out under a unified plan, it inevitably has a tendency to be blind. Some products are produced by everyone, forming a backlog, while some products needed by all parties cannot meet the needs, resulting in a lot of waste of technical strength, financial resources, and materials. Based on this situation, the conference believes that one of the current basic tasks of the mechanical engineering industry is to rationally organize the national mechanical engineering industry and gradually move towards planned economy. The national mechanical engineering industry must determine production based on sales, in accordance with the principle of production, supply, and marketing balance, and gradually implement planned management separately according to the principle of division of labor between the central and local governments, that is, gradually implement the policy of unified production plan, unified sales, and unified foreign orders.

    Regarding the unified production plan, the conference believes that measures should be taken with emphasis and steps, and be carried out according to the degree of importance and urgency. The conference decided that, in order to ensure the needs of important equipment for national basic construction, the main electromechanical products should be identified as products under the unified allocation of the state or products managed by the First Ministry of Machine Building. These products are subject to unified planning and production and unified supply by the central government; the production of daily necessities, or non-major products, are balanced by local governments, or temporarily produced and sold by themselves. The classification catalog for the management of various products was discussed at the meeting and will be announced by the State Planning Commission.

    In order to gradually incorporate into the national plan, the conference decided, based on the enterprise's technical equipment conditions and the needs of the country, to designate some local state-owned factories, joint state-private enterprises, and private factories to undertake the task of centrally managed products with a part of their capacity. These enterprises will have corresponding business contacts with the bureaus of the First Ministry of Machine Building in the future, and the products they produce should be carried out in accordance with the unified plan of the bureaus of the First Ministry of Machine Building.

    Regarding unified sales and unified ordering, the conference decided that in the future, strict application procedures will be implemented for the allocation of products under the unified allocation of the state and products managed by the First Ministry of Machine Building; in the future, the ordering of machinery and equipment from foreign countries must be subject to unified management.

    The conference studied the needs of all parties for machinery and believed that with the development of national industrialization and agricultural cooperation, with the transformation of the entire national economy, and the improvement of people's lives, the needs of all parties for machinery and daily-use metal products are increasing day by day, and the development of the mechanical engineering industry has broad prospects. The conference pointed out that the local mechanical engineering industry mainly serves the local economic undertakings, and should actively increase new varieties and try to meet the needs of agriculture, handicrafts, and people's lives. At the same time, since the number of machinery used in various aspects in the vast areas is increasing day by day, developing mechanical repair business should also become an important task of the local mechanical engineering industry.

    The various events decided at this conference will be submitted to the higher authorities for approval before implementation.

    This conference was held in Beijing from August 17th to 28th. The participants in this conference included the heads of local industrial bureaus and industrial halls of major administrative regions, provinces, and cities, representatives of various industrial ministries of the central government and other relevant departments, as well as the directors of various bureaus of the First Ministry of Machine Building and the heads of local offices.

    全国机械工业会议确定今后基本任务
    合理组织机械工业走向计划化
    【新华社七日讯】中央人民政府第一机械工业部最近召开了全国机械工业会议。这次会议是在中央人民政府国家计划委员会指示下召开的。会议决定把全国的机械工业逐步地纳入国家计划的轨道，以克服目前各地机械工业中存在的某些盲目发展的现象，更充分地发挥机械工业的潜在能力。
    会议首先对于我国机械工业的特点和目前的情况作了全面的研究和分析。会议指出，解放后，我国机械工业发展很快，几年来正在逐步地由解放前的半殖民地、半封建性质的修理、装配的工业改变为独立的机器制造工业。但由于这种发展不是在统一的计划下进行的，因此不免带有盲目的倾向。有些产品大家都生产，形成积压，而各方面所需要的有些产品又不能满足需要，以致技术力量、财力物力造成了不少浪费。根据这种情况，会议认为，机械工业当前的基本任务之一，就是要把全国的机械工业合理地组织起来，逐步地走向计划化。全国机械工业必须根据产供销平衡的原则，以销定产，并按中央和地方分工的原则，分别逐步实行计划管理，即逐步实行统一生产计划、统一销售、统一国外订货的方针。
    关于统一生产计划方面，会议认为，应采取有重点有步骤的措施，分别轻重缓急来进行。会议决定，目前为了保证国家基本建设的重要设备的需要，首先把主要的机电产品，确定为国家统一分配产品或第一机械工业部部管产品，这些产品由中央统一计划生产和统一供应；日用品的生产，或非主要的产品，则由地方平衡，或暂时自产自销。各种产品管理的分类目录，会议中进行了讨论，将由国家计划委员会公布。
    为了逐步纳入国家计划，会议决定根据企业技术设备条件和国家的需要，指定一部分地方国营厂、公私合营厂及私营厂，将其能力之一部担任中央管理的产品任务，这些企业今后和第一机械工业部所属管理局相应的发生业务联系，所生产的这些产品应按第一机械工业部各管理局的统一计划进行。
    关于统一销售和统一订货方面，会议决定，今后对国家统一分配产品和第一机械工业部部管产品的分配，实行严格的申请手续；今后向国外订购机器设备，必须实行统一管理。
    会议研究了各方面对于机械的需要，认为随着国家工业化和农业合作化的发展，随着整个国民经济的改造，人民生活的提高，各方面对机械及日用金属制品的需要与日俱增，机械工业的发展有着广阔的前途。会议指出，地方机械工业主要是为地方经济事业服务，应积极增加新品种，尽量满足农业、手工业及人民生活的需要，同时，由于广大地区各方面使用机械的数量日益增加，因此发展机械修理业务也应该成为地方机械工业的一个重要任务。
    这次会议决定的各项事件，将报请上级机关批准后执行。
    这次会议是八月十七日到二十八日在北京举行的。参加这次会议的有各大行政区、省、市的地方工业局、工业厅的负责人，中央各工业部及其他有关部门的代表，以及第一机械工业部各管理局局长及各地办事处负责人等。
