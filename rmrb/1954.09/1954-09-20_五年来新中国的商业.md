    New China's Commerce in the Past Five Years
    By Our Staff Reporter
    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, with the continuous growth of industrial and agricultural production and the gradual increase of people's purchasing power, national commerce has greatly developed. In 1953, the total retail commodity circulation volume increased by nearly 100% compared to 1950. Socialist state-owned commerce has achieved tremendous development by implementing the policy of serving production and the people's livelihood and continuously strengthening the socialist economic forces. By the end of 1953, there were nearly 35,000 state-owned commercial institutions with a total of more than 660,000 employees, of which the Ministry of Commerce system accounted for more than 440,000 people and more than 17,000 institutions. The quantity and variety of commodities supplied by state-owned commerce have increased year by year, and the proportion of operation has also increased year by year. In 1953, state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce accounted for about 70% of the total wholesale volume of commodities in the domestic market. In the total retail sales, state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce have accounted for about 42%.
    State-owned commerce is the leading force in China's commerce. Due to its development and growth, it has played a significant role in stabilizing the market, expanding urban-rural mutual assistance, enlivening the exchange of materials, promoting the development of production, and meeting the needs of the people's lives.
    The long-term inflation caused by the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang resulted in price fluctuations and rampant commercial speculation, which seriously damaged production and caused great difficulties for the people's lives. As soon as the Central People's Government was established, it regarded stabilizing prices as one of its important tasks. In the spring of 1950, under the guidance of the correct financial and economic policies of the state, and in coordination with various measures, state-owned commerce sold a large amount of materials to the market, severely打击 (daji - crack down on/strike a blow) speculative commerce, thereby stopping the long-term inflation and stabilizing prices.
    After the national prices were initially stabilized in the summer of 1950, false purchasing power disappeared, and the market once showed a sluggish situation. State-owned trade organizations, on the one hand, used processing, ordering, purchasing and other methods in cities to help legitimate private industrial and commercial enterprises overcome difficulties; at the same time, they purchased a large amount of agricultural products and non-staple foods, supported the development of cooperatives, and encouraged private merchants to participate in urban-rural material exchanges, starting from opening up the sales channels of unsalable local products, so that the market gradually became active.
    After American imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, it adopted a policy of blockade and embargo against our country in an attempt to suffocate our economy. In order to powerfully smash the conspiracy of American imperialism, at the beginning of 1951, state-owned commerce, in coordination with all parties, vigorously carried out the urban-rural material exchange movement. First of all, it expanded the purchase and sales plans of state-owned commerce, helped the rapid development of cooperative networks, organized the funds and labor of private merchants and vendors, and held thousands of different types of urban-rural material exchange meetings from large cities to primary markets in rural areas, restoring various commercial routes for the exchange of local products that had been interrupted for a long time, opening up new commercial networks, and expanding foreign trade with the Soviet Union and People's Democratic countries, thereby basically solving the problem of the滞销 (zhixiao - slow-moving/unsalable) situation of rural local and special products caused by the blockade and embargo of American imperialism, and further expanding the domestic market.
    The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements carried out nationwide in the spring of 1952 further consolidated the leading position of state-owned commerce in the market. After the "Five-Anti" movement, private industrial and commercial enterprises underwent transformation and adjustment. The污毒 (wudu - filth/poison) left over from the old society that hindered the progress of the country had been universally exposed and largely eliminated. The whole country took on a new look, and the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas developed more healthily, and the urban and rural economy became more active.
    In 1953, the state began large-scale, planned economic construction, and the tasks of state-owned commerce became more arduous. However, at the beginning of 1953, state-owned commercial departments, due to insufficient estimation of the new market situation and lack of deep understanding of the role and task of commercial work in the country's industrialization construction, once adopted some incorrect measures such as reducing purchases and压缩库存 (yasuo kucun - reducing inventory), which affected the consolidation of the socialist commercial front. These mistakes were quickly corrected with the instructions and assistance of the Central People's Government. After further clarifying the tasks of state-owned commerce during the transition period, state-owned commercial departments actively expanded their purchase and sales plans in order to better serve production and the needs of the people's lives, and greatly expanded their work on processing and ordering industrial products and purchasing agricultural products, thereby mastering the source of goods, supporting production, closely linking with state-owned industries and local state-owned industries, consolidating and expanding the socialist commercial front, strengthening the leadership of the market, and coordinating with the planned purchase of grain, and massively supplying the industrial products needed in rural areas, and supplying the needs of the people as much as possible.
    Due to the progress of large-scale construction, many new situations have occurred in China's market, the main point of which is that some commodities are in short supply. This is due to the large investment in industrial construction and cultural construction, the increase in the number of employed people, the increase in agricultural production and the increase in the purchase prices of agricultural products, and the result of the more rapid growth of people's purchasing power on the basis of the increase in the national economy recovery period; it is the result of the growth of purchasing power ahead of the growth of consumer goods and agricultural production materials. In order to rationally supply the people's needs for some daily necessities, the state, in addition to actively developing industrial and agricultural production, implemented the planned purchase and planned supply of grain and oil in the winter of 1953. On September 15 this year, it also implemented the planned purchase and planned supply of cotton cloth and the planned purchase of cotton. In addition to vigorously doing a good job in the relevant planned purchase and planned supply work, state-owned commerce must also strive to improve business management in order to better serve the people.
    Under the guidance of the state's policy of supporting the development of supply and marketing cooperatives, state-owned commerce actively helps the consolidation and development of cooperative commerce. As of the first quarter of this year, there were more than 32,000 grass-roots supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives across the country, with more than 132,000 fixed retail stores and more than 35,000 mobile retail outlets. There are more than 160 million members, an increase of more than eight times compared with 1950. The current total funds of cooperatives at all levels are 10 trillion yuan, an increase of 19.5 times compared with 1950, of which members' share capital has increased by 10.7 times. In 1953, the total retail sales of cooperatives accounted for 25.73% of the total retail sales of the market. It has increasingly become an important part of China's commerce, thereby further consolidating the leading position of state-owned commerce in the market.
    According to the state's general task in the transition period, state-owned commerce bears a major responsibility for gradually transforming capitalist industry and commerce. It must cooperate with the socialist transformation of capitalist industry through processing, ordering, unified purchase, and exclusive sales, and implement the policies of utilization, restriction, and transformation of capitalist retail commerce through various forms of state capitalism such as consignment sales and distribution.
    In order to help ethnic minorities develop production, gradually improve their lives, and change their backward economic conditions, according to the party and the state's ethnic policies, state-owned commercial departments have successively established retail departments, purchasing stations, processing plants, and trade groups of state-owned trade companies in various ethnic minority areas. According to incomplete statistics at the end of 1953, more than 1,800 large and small trade institutions have been established in ethnic minority areas across the country, an increase of 40.83% compared with 1952 and 161.16% compared with 1951. Among them, the fixed and mobile trade groups that are most suitable for the special conditions of ethnic minority areas have developed from more than 500 in 1952 to more than 800 in 1953. In the past five years, more than 6,000 trade cadres of ethnic minorities have been trained. According to incomplete statistics in June 1953, more than 460 supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels have been established in ethnic minority pastoral areas across the country, with more than 431,500 members and 28 billion yuan of their own funds. After the establishment of state-owned ethnic trade institutions in various places, they purchased and promoted a large number of livestock products and local products of various ethnic minorities, and supplied them with a large number of production and living materials they needed. By the end of 1953, the total amount of local specialties purchased in ethnic minority areas increased by more than 70% compared with 1952 and about three times compared with 1951; the total supply amount increased by more than 60% compared with 1952 and more than three times compared with 1951. State-owned trade changed the unreasonable phenomenon of exchange parity in history through purchase and sales activities. It stimulated the growth of livestock products and other special products in various ethnic minority areas. People's income increased and purchasing power increased. Therefore, the lives of people of all ethnic groups have gradually improved. The miserable days when people of all ethnic groups could not eat salt, rice, drink tea, or wear cloth clothes for many years are gone forever.
    New China's commercial work has achieved great achievements in the past five years. Under the shining of the general task in the transition period, there will be greater achievements in the future.

    五年来新中国的商业
    本报记者
    中华人民共和国成立以来，在中国共产党和中央人民政府正确领导下，随着工农业生产不断增长、人民购买力的逐步提高，全国商业有很大的发展，一九五三年全国零售商品流转总额比较一九五○年提高将近一倍。社会主义的国营商业在贯彻为生产与人民生活服务并不断壮大社会主义经济力量的方针下，获得了巨大的发展。到一九五三年年底止，国营商业机构近三万五千个，工作人员共达六十六万余人，其中商业部系统达四十四万人，机构达一万七千余个。国营商业供应的商品数量和品种逐年增加，经营比重也逐年提高。一九五三年，在国内市场商品批发总额中，国营商业和合作社营商业约占百分之七十左右。零售总额中，国营商业和合作社营商业已占到百分之四十二左右。
    国营商业是我国商业的领导力量。由于它的发展、壮大，对于稳定市场、扩大城乡互助、活跃物资交流、促进生产的发展和供应人民生活需要等方面，都发挥了重大的作用。
    国民党反动统治所造成的长期通货膨胀，使物价波动，商业投机盛行，严重地破坏了生产，使人民生活遭遇到很大困难。中央人民政府一成立，就把稳定物价当作重要工作之一。一九五○年春，在国家正确的财政经济政策指导下，配合各方面的措施，国营商业向市场大量出售物资，给投机商业以严重的打击，从而停止了长期的通货膨胀，稳定了物价。
    一九五○年夏，全国物价初步获得稳定后，虚假购买力消失，市场曾一度出现呆滞局面。国营贸易机构一方面在城市用加工、订货、收购等办法帮助了正当私营工商业渡过了困难；同时大量收购农产品与副食品，扶植了合作社的发展并鼓励了私商参加城乡物资交流，从打开滞销土产的销路着手，使市场逐渐活跃起来。
    美国帝国主义发动了侵朝战争以后，对我国采取了封锁禁运政策，企图窒息我国经济，为了有力地粉碎美国帝国主义的阴谋，一九五一年初，国营商业在各方面配合下，大力开展了城乡物资交流运动。首先，扩大了国营商业的收购、销售计划，帮助了合作社网的迅速发展，组织了私商小贩的资金与人力，从大城市一直到农村的初级市场，召开了几千个不同类型的城乡物资交流会，恢复了中断已久的各种土产交流的商业路线，开辟了新的商业网，并扩大对苏联和人民民主国家的对外贸易，从而基本上解决了因美帝国主义封锁禁运而造成的农村土特产的滞销情况，进一步扩大了国内市场。
    一九五二年春，在全国范围内进行的“三反”
  “五反”运动，使国营商业对市场的领导地位进一步获得了巩固。“五反”以后，私营工商业进行了改造与调整，旧社会所遗留下来的妨害国家前进的污毒，已被普遍揭发并大量扫除，全国气象一新，城乡物资交流更加健康地开展起来，城乡经济益加活跃。
      一九五三年国家开始了大规模的、有计划的经济建设，国营商业的任务更加繁重。但是，在一九五三年初，国营商业部门，由于对市场新情况估计不足对商业工作在国家工业化建设中的作用与任务，缺乏深刻的认识，曾一度采用了减少收购、压缩库存等一些不正确的措施，影响了社会主义商业阵地的巩固。这些错误在中央人民政府的指示和帮助下，才迅速纠正。国营商业部门在进一步明确了国营商业在国家过渡时期的任务以后，为了更好地为生产和人民生活需要服务，积极扩大了收购和销售计划，大量扩展了对工业品的加工、订货和对农产品的收购等工作，从而，掌握了货源，扶植了生产，密切了与国营工业、地方国营工业的联系，巩固并扩大了社会主义商业的阵地，加强了对市场的领导，并且配合了粮食计划收购，大量供应了农村所需的工业品，尽可能地供应了人民的需要。
    由于大规模建设的进展，我国市场发生了许多新的情况，其中主要的一点是：若干商品发生供不应求的现象。这是由于工业建设和文化建设的大量投资，就业人数增多，农业增产和农产品收购价格提高，人民购买力在国民经济恢复时期已经提高的基础上，更加迅速增长起来的结果；是购买力的增长走在消费品和农业生产资料的生产的增长的前面的结果。为了合理地供应人民对若干生活必需品的需要，国家除积极发展工农业生产外，在一九五三年冬曾先后实行了粮食和油料的计划收购和计划供应。今年九月十五日又实行了棉布计划收购、计划供应和棉花计划收购。国营商业除了大力做好有关的计划收购、计划供应工作以外，还要努力改善经营管理，以便更好地为人民服务。
    在国家扶植供销合作社发展的政策的指导之下，国营商业积极帮助合作社商业的巩固与发展。截至今年第一季度，全国共有三万二千多个基层供销合作社和消费合作社，有十三万二千多个固定的零售店和三万五千多个流动的零售点。社员共有一亿六千余万，较一九五○年增加了八倍多。各级合作社目前共有资金十万亿元，较一九五○年增加了十九点五倍，其中社员股金增加了十点七倍。一九五三年全年合作社零售额占市场零售总额的百分之二十五点七三，它已日益成为我国商业的一个重要组成部分，从而更加巩固了国营商业在市场上的领导地位。
    根据国家在过渡时期总任务，国营商业对于逐步改造资本主义工商业担负着重大的责任。它要通过加工、订货、统购、包销以配合对资本主义工业的社会主义改造，通过代销、经销等国家资本主义的各种形式，对资本主义零售商业贯彻利用、限制和改造的政策。
    为了帮助少数民族发展生产，逐步改善生活，改变经济上落后的状况，根据党和国家的民族政策，国营商业部门先后在各少数民族地区设立了国营贸易公司的门市部、采购站、加工厂和贸易小组等。据一九五三年底不完全统计，全国少数民族地区共建立大小贸易机构一千八百多个，比一九五二年增加了百分之四十点八三，比一九五一年增加了百分之一六一点一六，其中最适合民族地区特殊条件的固定和流动贸易小组，由一九五二年的五百多个发展到一九五三年的八百多个。五年来已培养了少数民族的贸易干部六千多人。据一九五三年六月不完全统计，全国少数民族牧业区已建立各级供销合作社共达四百六十多个，拥有社员四十三万一千五百余人，自有资金二百八十亿元。各地国营民族贸易机构建立后，大量收购和推销了各少数民族的畜产品和土特产品，并大批供应了他们所需要的生产和生活资料。到一九五三年年底止，在少数民族地区收购土特产的总额比一九五二年增加了百分之七十以上，比一九五一年增加了三倍左右；供应总额比一九五二年增加百分之六十以上，比一九五一年增加了三倍以上。国营贸易通过购销活动改变了历史上交换比价的不合理现象。刺激了各少数民族区域畜产品及其他特产品的增长，人民收入增加，购买力提高，因而各族人民的生活逐渐得到改善。过去各族人民长年吃不到盐巴、大米，喝不到茶，穿不上布衣的悲惨日子，已一去不复返了。
    五年来新中国的商业工作已获得了重大成就。在过渡时期总任务的光辉照耀下，今后将会有更大的成就。
