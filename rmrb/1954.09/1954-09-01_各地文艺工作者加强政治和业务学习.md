Since the People's Daily published the editorial "Improve the Political and Artistic Cultivation of Literary and Art Cadres" on July 15th, more than a dozen newspapers and literary journals across the country have reprinted it. "Liberation Daily" in East China published an editorial on July 30th titled "Strengthen the Political and Professional Learning of Literary and Art Cadres," focusing on the learning issues of literary and art cadres in Shanghai. "Wenyi Bao" (Literary Gazette) reprinted the People's Daily editorial in its 14th issue and published an editorial in its 15th issue titled "Strengthen Learning, Enhance Political Enthusiasm and Moral Cultivation," addressing the unsatisfactory learning situation of literary and art cadres nationwide and the issue of moral cultivation of literary and art workers.

The political and professional learning of literary and art cadres has attracted the attention of literary and art circles in various regions, and relevant authorities and organizations are leading literary and art workers in various regions to improve their learning.

The Shandong Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles held a symposium on July 28th to discuss the People's Daily editorial and the learning issues of literary and art cadres in Shandong Province. The symposium reflected that some literary and art organizations in Shandong Province do not attach importance to learning. For example, the political learning in several state-owned theater troupes under the leadership of the Shandong Provincial Cultural Affairs Bureau is spontaneous and unregulated. The leaders of some literary and art troupes only pay attention to routine work in performances, neglecting political and artistic education for cadres, which leads to the long-term stagnation of cadres' skills. Some literary and art workers neglect political learning or are eager for quick success in learning without seeking thorough understanding. Some emphasize the learning of professional skills while neglecting the study of literary and artistic theory. At the meeting, everyone criticized the complacency and lack of planning among literary and art workers in the province.

The Yunnan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles has systematically organized literary and art workers to study Fadeyev's "On the Work of the Writers' Association," Simonov's "Problems in the Development of Soviet Drama Creation," Ehrenburg's "On the Work of Writers," and recently organized professional and amateur literary and art workers to study Gladkov's "On the Morality of Writers." During the study and discussions, it was found that many literary and art workers in Yunnan Province did not pay attention to learning in the past, were not concerned about politics, were busy with daily routines, were satisfied with the status quo, and did not seek progress. Some had not even read a famous literary work since liberation. After more than a month of study, participants have gained a lot. After the learning, a learning system was established based on the actual situation to regularize political and professional learning.

The preparatory committee of the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Nanjing Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the Nanjing Library jointly launched a "Weekly Literary and Art Lecture" on August 15th, inviting experts to lecture on Chinese classical literary works and selected foreign classical works and writers.

Some literary and art units and literary and art workers in Beijing are also beginning to strengthen their learning. The editorial department of "Wenyi Xuexi" (Literary and Art Study) magazine, in order to help literary and art workers choose reading materials for systematic and planned self-study, has formulated a "Reference List of Books for Literary and Art Workers to Study Political Theory and Classical Literature." It includes two parts: Marxist-Leninist theoretical works and Chinese and foreign classical literary masterpieces, totaling more than one hundred books. In this list, the section on Marxist-Leninist theoretical works lists books that are particularly necessary and relatively easy for literary and art workers to read. The section on Chinese and foreign classical literary masterpieces lists representative works of some of the most socially influential writers. This list has been published in the fifth issue of "Wenyi Xuexi" magazine.

Under the leadership of the Party General Branch and the Art Department of the China Youth Art Theatre, professional cadres of the theater have studied and discussed the People's Daily editorial. During the discussion, many people felt that their political and professional cultivation was poor and recognized the necessity of strengthening learning. The lack of knowledge of some comrades in the theater is shocking. They did not even know who was the chief representative of China at the Geneva Conference, which countries Indochina included, or who Chekhov was. Some comrades do not read literary works. Many comrades examined some of their erroneous views and their lack of diligence and perseverance in political and professional learning based on the key points pointed out in the editorial. Some actors reviewed their past erroneous views that "it doesn't matter whether you study political theory or not, as long as you have skills." Some actors reviewed that they had not read a book on political theory in the past five years, and could not answer the questions of political common sense mentioned in the People's Daily editorial. Many actors felt that their poor political and artistic learning directly affected the improvement of their creation. For example, when the theater rehearsed "Spring Breeze Blows to the Nomin River," the lack of deep understanding of the socialist transformation of agriculture and the class struggle in rural areas affected the understanding of the theme of the play and the creation of characters. The Party General Branch and the Art Department of the theater have revised the political theory and professional learning plan for the second half of this year based on the specific situation of the theater's performance and the suggestions of everyone.

The leaders of the Beijing People's Art Theatre called on all professional cadres of the theater to strengthen learning in the spirit of the People's Daily editorial. Theater cadres have made many suggestions on learning issues. The Art Department of the theater is currently formulating a learning plan for the second half of the year. The administrative leadership is also arranging to assign a dedicated person to handle the professional learning of cadres and plans to send several comrades to attend literary and art courses at the Central Academy of Drama and Peking University in the next semester to help with the learning in the theater.

The Central Song and Dance Troupe takes the People's Daily editorial as one of the documents for cadre learning. The leaders of the troupe called on all professional cadres of the troupe to learn in accordance with the spirit of the editorial. Political learning and professional learning should be given equal importance.

The political theory learning of the Beijing Film Actors Troupe is more regular and is carried out in accordance with the unified deployment of the Party Committee of the Ministry of Culture. The current affairs learning of the troupe's actors has not been able to be carried out frequently and in an organized manner. Recently, due to the leadership's emphasis on the publicity of the Geneva Conference, reports were organized, which aroused the universal attention of the actors, but some actors did not pay enough attention to domestic current affairs. In terms of professional learning, the troupe is one of the better units affiliated to the Central Cultural Ministry's Film Bureau system. Since the troupe was established in September last year, the members' enthusiasm for learning has been high. In the past, many actors had made many films, but their learning in literary and artistic theory was poor. They studied performance theory last year. This year, theoretical learning is carried out in conjunction with rehearsals.

The Central Cultural Ministry's Film Bureau Film Script Creation Institute did not pay close attention to professional learning in the past, and there was a spontaneous trend. Recently, the institute has formulated a study plan for screenwriters based on the instructions of the Art Committee of the Central Film Bureau.

In addition to regular political theory learning, the Chinese Artists Association also supplements it with current affairs learning. The association's current affairs test has become a system and is held every two months. The test has been conducted twice in February and April this year, and another test was conducted recently. The content of the test has increased compared to the previous two times. The past two times were limited to general current affairs knowledge. This test added a section on literary and artistic knowledge in addition to current affairs. In the future, it is planned to hold tests regularly.

After the editorial was published, Zang Xiuzhi from the Zibo Central Cultural Center in Shandong Province wrote to this newspaper saying: The Zibo Cultural Center has nine cadres, and eight of them failed the general line learning test. Many cadres could not answer questions such as "What is the current class line of the Party in rural areas?" "What is the significance of implementing the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain?" "What is the significance of developing heavy industry?" Some of the answers were ridiculous, but this phenomenon did not attract attention. Some literary and art cadres have very poor cultivation but are arrogant and complacent. They believe that the editorial has given them a great education.

### 各地文艺工作者加强政治和业务学习

    各地文艺工作者加强政治和业务学习
    七月十五日本报发表“提高文艺干部的政治修养和艺术修养”的社论后，全国各地十几种报纸和文艺刊物已加以转载。华东“解放日报”在七月三十日就上海文艺干部学习问题，发表了题为“加强文艺干部的政治和业务学习”的社论。“文艺报”第十四期转载了本报社论，第十五期又针对全国文艺干部不能令人满意的学习情况和文艺工作者的道德修养问题，发表了题为“加强学习，提高政治热情和道德修养”的社论。
    文艺干部的政治学习和业务学习问题，已受到各地文艺界的注意，有关的机关和团体，正领导各地文艺工作者改进学习。
    山东省文学艺术工作者联合会在七月二十八日举行了座谈会，讨论了本报社论和山东省文艺干部的学习问题。座谈会反映，山东省有些文艺团体还不重视学习，如山东省文化事业管理局所领导的几个国营剧团的政治学习有自流现象。有的文艺团体的领导人只注意演出中事务性的工作，忽视对干部进行政治教育和艺术业务教育，因此，干部的水平长期不能提高。有的文艺工作者忽视政治学习，或学习时急于求成，不求甚解。有的偏重业务技巧的学习，忽视文艺理论的学习。会上，大家对该省文艺工作者在学习上的自满情绪和缺乏计划进行了批评。
    云南省文学艺术工作者联合会曾有计划地组织文艺工作者，学习了法捷耶夫的“论作家协会的工作”、西蒙诺夫的“苏联戏剧创作发展的问题”、爱伦堡的“论作家的工作”等文章；最近又组织专业和业余的文艺工作者学习了革拉特珂夫的“论作家的道德”等文。在学习讨论中，发现云南省文艺工作者中，有不少人过去不注意学习，不关心政治，每天忙于事务，满足现状，不求进取，有的甚至从解放以来没有读过一部文学名著。经过一个多月的学习，参加学习的人都有了不少收获。学习后并根据实际情况，订出了学习制度，以便使政治和业务学习经常化。
    江苏省文学艺术工作者联合会筹备委员会、南京市文学艺术工作者联合会、南京图书馆，八月十五日起联合举办“星期文艺讲座”，对中国的古典文学作品和对部分的外国古典作品与作家，分别邀请专人讲述。
    北京的一些文艺单位和文艺工作者对学习也在开始加强。“文艺学习”杂志编辑部为了帮助文艺工作者选择读物，以便有系统有计划地进行自修，拟定了一个“文艺工作者学习政治理论和古典文学的参考书目”。其中包括马克思列宁主义理论著作和中外古典文学名著两个部分，共有一百多部。这批书目中，关于马克思列宁主义理论著作部分，开列了为文艺工作者特别需要阅读、并且比较容易阅读的书籍；中外古典文学名著部分，开列了最有社会影响的一些作家的代表作品。这个书目已在“文艺学习”杂志第五期上发表。
    中国青年艺术剧院的业务干部在该院党总支和艺术室的领导下，对本报社论曾进行了学习和讨论。在讨论中，许多人感到自己的政治、业务修养很差，认识到加强学习的必要。剧院有些同志的知识贫乏是惊人的，连我国出席日内瓦会议的首席代表是谁也不知道，印度支那包括那几个国家、契诃夫是什么人也都回答不出。有的同志不阅读文艺作品。许多同志根据社论中指出的各项要点检查了自己在政治和业务学习上的一些错误看法和不够刻苦、缺乏毅力等缺点。有的演员检讨了自己过去认为“政治理论学不学没什么，只要有技术就行”的错误观点；有的演员检讨自己五年来没有看过一本政治理论书籍，本报社论中所举例的政治常识问题，他也答不出。有不少演员感到因为平时的政治、艺术学习差，直接影响了创作的提高。如该剧院排演“春风吹到诺敏河”时，由于对农业的社会主义改造和对农村中的阶级斗争问题认识不深刻，就影响了对剧本主题的理解和人物创造。该院党总支和艺术室已根据剧院演出的具体情况和参考大家的建议，修订了今年下半年的政治理论和业务学习计划。
    北京人民艺术剧院的领导上号召全院业务干部以本报社论的精神加强学习。剧院干部对学习问题提出不少建议，现该院的艺术处正在拟定下半年的学习计划。行政领导方面也在安排抽出一个专人搞干部的业务学习工作，并拟派几位同志在下学期抽时间到中央戏剧学院、北京大学旁听文艺课，以便对剧院的学习有帮助。
    中央歌舞团把本报社论作为干部学习的文件之一。该团领导上号召全团业务干部必须按照社论精神进行学习，政治学习和业务学习应该并重。
    北京电影演员剧团的政治理论学习较正规，是按照文化部党委的统一布置进行的。剧团演员的时事学习尚未能经常有组织地进行，最近因领导方面重视关于日内瓦会议的宣传，组织了听报告等，引起演员的普遍注意，但有些演员对国内的时事注意还不够。在业务学习方面，该剧团是中央文化部电影局系统所属单位较好的一个。该剧团自去年九月成立后，团员要求学习的热情很高，过去不少演员拍过不少影片，但在文艺理论上学习差。去年学习了表演理论。今年结合排戏，进行必要的理论学习。
    中央文化部电影局电影剧本创作所过去的业务学习抓得不紧，有自流现象。最近该所已根据中央电影局艺术委员会的指示，拟定了一个电影编剧的学习计划。
    中国美术家协会除正规的政治理论学习外，并辅以时事学习。现该协会的时事测验已形成制度，每两月举行一次。今年二月、四月份已测验过两次，最近又进行一次测验，测验内容比前两次增多。过去两次仅限于一般时事常识，这次测验除时事外，加入文艺常识部分。以后准备经常按期举行测验。
    社论发表后，本报接山东省淄博市中心文化馆臧修智来信说：淄博市文化馆有干部九人，总路线学习测验有八人不及格，像“当前党在农村中的阶级路线是什么？”“实行粮食统购统销政策的意义”“发展重工业的意义”等问题，很多干部答不出，有的答案很可笑，而这种现象并未引起注意。有的文艺干部修养很差，却骄傲自满。他们认为社论给他们很大教育。
