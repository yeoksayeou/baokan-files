    Strive to Complete the Sacred Task of Liberating Taiwan
    Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
    The Chinese working class is building the socialist mansion with boundless enthusiasm and selfless labor, but the enemy of the Chinese people—the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique—still occupies a cornerstone of our foundation: Taiwan. Under the shelter and support of U.S. imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is carrying out all kinds of sabotage activities and plotting to attack the motherland, provoke world war, and drag the Chinese people back into the abyss of darkness to be slaves of the American rich and their lackeys. The Chinese working class recognizes Chiang Kai-shek and his partners, and also recognizes the U.S. imperialists. The Chinese workers have tasted and fully understand what the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and U.S. imperialism is like. The Chinese working class has long been determined to eliminate the villains who are still squatting on our sacred territory of Taiwan.
    The Chinese working class despises Chiang Kai-shek and his partners, but will never become complacent because of this, nor will it think that the Chiang Kai-shek clique's occupation of Taiwan is an insignificant matter. On the contrary, it is like a hateful boil that must be removed. Taiwan is an inseparable part of our country, and this boil is attached to our body. The Chinese workers are determined to eliminate this bad thing. Precisely for this reason, the workers across the country have expressed warm support for Premier Zhou Enlai's diplomatic report, and also expressed warm support for the "Joint Declaration of Democratic Parties and People's Organizations of the People's Republic of China for the Liberation of Taiwan," and are working enthusiastically for the sacred task of liberating Taiwan.
    The history of the Chinese working class's struggle has proven to the people of the whole country and the world that it will bravely shoulder the responsibilities it should bear. Just looking at the situation in the past ten years, during the Liberation War, although many large cities were still under the terrorist rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the broad masses of workers actively cooperated with the People's Liberation Army's struggle and played a major role in defeating the enemy and protecting factories, mines, and railways. In the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, large numbers of employees volunteered to go to Korea to participate in the work at the front. The broad masses of workers in domestic production posts also demonstrated unparalleled patriotism and internationalism, signed patriotic covenants, launched labor competitions, increased production, practiced strict economy, and actively supported the Chinese People's Volunteers. The broad masses of workers also automatically donated money or voluntarily maintained their current wage levels or even reduced some wages. Of course, to liberate Taiwan and completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek clique is something the working class has long yearned for. There is no doubt that the Chinese working class will respond to the motherland's call with a hundredfold courage and contribute all its strength.
    Our position is on the production front. Completing or overfulfilling the state's production and construction plans is what we should do first, and it is also our concrete support for the struggle to liberate Taiwan. The liberation of Taiwan is a comprehensive struggle in military, political, economic, cultural... aspects. Without victory on the production front, it will inevitably increase the difficulties in the struggle, and victory on the production front will powerfully guarantee the victory of the struggle. So what should we do?
    First, we must further carry out labor competitions, actively participate in the technical innovation movement, work hard to learn technology, and constantly improve our technical level; provide rationalization proposals and promote advanced experience to solve these problems, focusing on the key problems or weak links in production and capital construction, and constantly improve labor productivity. Ensure that all indicators of the national plan are met or exceeded.
    Second, we must strengthen labor discipline, correct labor attitudes, and earnestly implement the "Outline of Internal Labor Rules for State-Owned Enterprises" promulgated by the Government Administration Council. Only by strengthening labor discipline and correcting labor attitudes can we effectively ensure that our production undertakings are not constrained by a few people who do not know how to cherish themselves, so that individual saboteurs have no chance to take advantage of, to ensure production safety, and to ensure the completion of all indicators of the national plan. It should be pointed out that the Chinese working class's labor discipline and labor attitude are good, but there are still a few people who are not highly aware and cannot consciously abide by discipline, which requires mass supervision and criticism. This supervision and criticism is the maintenance of the overall interests of the working class and the interests of the country. In the struggle to liberate Taiwan, we must strengthen this struggle to safeguard class interests and national interests.
    Third, strengthen the unity of the working class, and more strongly unite the people of the whole country to fight together for the liberation of Taiwan. In order to strengthen the unity of the working class, it is necessary to strengthen the study of current events and policies, and overcome the petty-bourgeois habits and the influence of bourgeois ideology such as narrow selfishness, freedom and laxity, lack of concern for collective interests, and non-compliance with rules and regulations, which exist in large numbers in our working class ranks. The working class must closely unite around its own political party—the Communist Party of China—and constantly improve its level of awareness and organization. In this way, we can more strongly unite the people of the whole country. This unity is an invincible force that will completely bury the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.
    The struggle to liberate Taiwan is bound to be victorious. There is no doubt that the workers across the country have this unshakable belief. Socialism must be built not only on the mainland, but also in Taiwan.
    Finally, it must be pointed out that the workers in Taiwan are living an extremely painful life under the reactionary rule and enslavement of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and U.S. imperialism. In order to end this painful life, the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique must be ended. The working class is united. The workers on the mainland and the workers in Taiwan should unite as one and fight for the common cause of liberating Taiwan.

    为完成解放台湾的神圣任务而奋斗
    中华全国总工会主席　赖若愚
    中国工人阶级正以无比的热情与忘我的劳动建设着社会主义大厦，可是中国人民的仇敌——蒋介石卖国集团却仍然窃据着我们的一块地基——台湾。蒋介石卖国集团在美帝国主义的庇护与支持下，进行着各种各样的破坏活动，并且阴谋进攻祖国大陆，挑拨世界战争，重新把中国人民拉到黑暗的深渊，做美国富翁们和他们的狗腿们的奴隶。中国工人阶级认识蒋介石和他的伙伴们，也认识美帝国主义者，中国工人尝过了并且完全懂得蒋介石卖国集团和美帝国主义的统治是什么滋味。对于至今仍然蹲在我国神圣领土台湾的坏蛋，中国工人阶级是早已有决心把他们干掉的。
    中国工人阶级鄙视蒋介石和他的伙伴们，但是决不因此就麻痹自己，决不认为蒋介石集团窃据着台湾是无足轻重的事情。相反的，它好比一个可恶的毒疮，不把它除掉是不行的。台湾是我国不可分割的一部分，这个毒疮是附着在我们的身上的，中国工人有决心消灭这个坏东西。正因为如此，所以全国工人对周恩来总理的外交报告表示了热烈的拥护，对于“中华人民共和国各民主党派各人民团体为解放台湾联合宣言”同样表示了热烈拥护，并正在为解放台湾这个神圣任务而热情地工作着。
    中国工人阶级的斗争历史已经在全国和全世界人的面前证明自己是一定会勇敢地担当起自己应当担当的责任的。仅就近十年来的情况来说，在解放战争时期，当时虽然许多大城市还在蒋介石匪帮的恐怖统治之下，可是广大的工人群众却积极地配合了人民解放军的斗争，在战胜敌人和保护工厂、矿山、铁路等方面起了重大的作用。在抗美援朝斗争中，成批的职工志愿赴朝，参加了前方的工作，在国内生产岗位上的广大工人群众，也表现了无比的爱国主义和国际主义精神，订立爱国公约，展开劳动竞赛，增加生产，厉行节约，积极地支援了中国人民志愿军。广大的工人群众并自动捐献，或自愿维持当时的工资水平甚至减低一些工资。当然，要解放台湾，要彻底消灭蒋介石集团，那更是工人阶级所渴望已久的事情，毫无疑问，中国工人阶级一定会勇气百倍地响应祖国的召唤，贡献出所有的力量来。
    我们的岗位是在生产战线上，完成或超额完成国家的生产建设计划，就是我们首先应当做到的，也就是我们对于解放台湾的斗争的具体支援。解放台湾是一个军事、政治、经济、文化……各方面的全面斗争，没有生产战线上的胜利，就必然要增加斗争中的困难，而生产战线上的胜利，则必将有力地保障斗争的胜利。那末我们应当做一些什么呢？
    第一，要进一步开展劳动竞赛，积极参加技术革新运动，努力学习技术，不断地提高技术水平；针对着生产和基本建设中的关键问题或薄弱环节，提供合理化建议、推广先进经验，来解决这些问题，不断地提高劳动生产率。保证达到或超过国家计划的各项指标。
    第二，要加强劳动纪律，端正劳动态度，切实执行政务院所颁布的“国营企业内部劳动规则纲要”。只有加强劳动纪律，端正劳动态度，才能有效地保障我们的生产事业不为少数不知自爱的分子所牵制，才能使个别破坏分子无隙可乘，才能保证生产安全，才能保证完成国家计划的各项指标。应当指出，中国工人阶级的劳动纪律和劳动态度是好的，但是也还有少数人觉悟不高，不能自觉地遵守纪律，这就有待于群众性的监督、批评。这种监督和批评就是对于工人阶级的整体利益和国家利益的维护，在解放台湾的斗争中，一定要加强这一种维护阶级利益和国家利益的斗争。
    第三，加强工人阶级的团结，并更坚强地团结全国人民，为解放台湾而共同奋斗。为了加强工人阶级的团结，就必须加强时事政策学习，克服在我们工人阶级的队伍中大量存在着的狭隘自私、自由散漫、不关心集体利益、不遵守规程制度等小资产阶级的习气和资产阶级的思想影响。工人阶级必须紧紧地团结在自己的政党——中国共产党的周围，不断地提高自己的觉悟程度和组织程度。这样，我们才能更坚强地团结全国人民。这种团结是一种不可战胜的力量，这种力量将把蒋介石卖国集团彻底埋葬。
    解放台湾的斗争是一定要胜利的，毫无疑问，全国工人有这种不可动摇的信念。社会主义不但要在大陆上建设起来，也要在台湾建设起来。
    最后，必须指出，台湾的工人兄弟们处在蒋介石卖国集团和美帝国主义的反动统治和奴役之下，过着极端痛苦的生活，为了结束这种痛苦生活，就必须结束蒋介石卖国集团的反动统治。工人阶级是统一的，大陆上的工人和台湾的工人，应当团结一致，为解放台湾的共同事业而奋斗。
