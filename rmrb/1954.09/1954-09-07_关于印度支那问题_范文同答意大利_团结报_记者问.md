Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, September 5th:范文同, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, answered some questions posed to him by a reporter from "Unità," the organ of the Italian Communist Party. The questions and answers are as follows:

    Question: The agreements on the Indochina issue signed at the Geneva Conference are a great victory for the cause of world peace. Within the scope of such a victory with universal significance, can you point out the specific gains that the Geneva Accords have brought to the struggle of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people, as well as to the struggles of the Laotian and Cambodian peoples?

    Answer: The agreements signed in Geneva and the final declaration of the conference halted hostilities in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia and helped restore peace in Indochina based on the recognition of the national rights of the Vietnamese, Laotian, and Cambodian peoples.

    This has been clearly stipulated in the clauses of the final declaration of the Geneva Conference. We quote some clauses as follows:

    Article 2 of the Final Declaration: "The Conference takes note with satisfaction of the end of hostilities in Cambodia, Laos and Viet-Nam. The Conference expresses its conviction that the execution of the provisions set out in the present declaration and in the agreements on the cessation of hostilities will permit Cambodia, Laos and Viet-Nam henceforth, to play their part, in full independence and sovereignty, in the peaceful family of nations."

    Article 11 of the Final Declaration: "The Conference takes note of the declaration of the Government of France concerning its intention to settle its relations with each of the three States, on the basis of respect for their sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity."
    Article 12 of the Final Declaration: "In their relations with Cambodia, Laos and Viet Nam, each of the Members of the Geneva Conference undertakes to respect the sovereignty, the independence, the unity and the territorial integrity of the above-mentioned States, and to refrain from any interference in their internal affairs."

    Therefore, the Geneva agreements and the final declaration of the conference signify international recognition of the legitimate aspirations of the Vietnamese, Laotian, and Cambodian peoples, which were expressed in the preamble to the general statement of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam at the Geneva Conference as follows: "The fundamental position of the people and government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is: peace, independence, unity, and democracy."

    Therefore, the agreements signed in Geneva and the final declaration of the conference are first and foremost a great victory for the Vietnamese people, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the peoples of Laos and Cambodia; they are also a significant victory for all peoples struggling for national liberation.

    At the same time, the positive results of the Geneva Conference are a great achievement for the cause of world peace.

    Question: What do you think are the conditions for implementing the political measures stipulated in the Geneva Accords after the cessation of hostilities in Indochina? What obstacles do you foresee in implementing these political measures?

    Answer: In order to implement the political measures stipulated in the Geneva Accords after the cessation of hostilities in Indochina, the main conditions are as follows:

      (1) The signatory countries and participating countries faithfully, strictly, and thoroughly fulfill all the provisions in the agreements and the final declaration of the conference. To this end, it is particularly important to establish and develop mutual trust and friendly relations between the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Government of France, which is not only necessary for the correct implementation of the ceasefire agreement, but also for re-establishing normal relations between the two countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

      (2) All the Vietnamese people, from north to south, resolutely and successfully strive to faithfully and strictly implement Articles 6 and 7 of the final declaration of the Geneva Conference regarding the realization of Vietnam's unification by peaceful and democratic means and through free and democratic general elections.

    All the domestic and foreign policies of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are aimed at such a basic goal, which is to strive for the complete liberation of Vietnam and for consolidating a stable and lasting peace in Vietnam and Indochina.

    Those Vietnamese people who live in southern Vietnam, which is temporarily designated as the assembly area for the French Expeditionary Corps, will strive to create a situation and conditions conducive to the establishment of a government that represents the national aspirations, so as to unify the country through elections.

    I believe that the main obstacle to implementing these political measures is the policy of interference by the American aggressor bloc, who, together with their agent the Ngô Đình Diệm clique, are trying every possible means to sabotage the implementation of the Geneva Accords. In this regard, it must be pointed out their plan to forcibly relocate Vietnamese from the north, their "US aid" plan, and their plan to establish the so-called Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

      Therefore, the struggle of the Vietnamese people, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Indochinese people to fully implement the agreements and to achieve a satisfactory resolution of political issues is a struggle against the interference of the American imperialists and against their running dogs, in order to crush their conspiracy to undermine the implementation of the agreements.

    Question: On July 23, US Secretary of State Dulles said at a press conference that the US government believes that Cambodia, and perhaps Laos, could be included in the draft of the Southeast Asia Military Pact. Do you think this view is in accordance with the Geneva Accords?

      Answer: I think that the statement by US Secretary of State Dulles that the US government believes that Cambodia, and perhaps Laos, could be included in the draft of the Southeast Asia Military Pact, is not only inconsistent with the Geneva Accords and the final declaration of the conference, but is also completely contrary to the letter and spirit of these documents.

    Anyone who has read the statements issued by the governments of the Kingdom of Laos and the Kingdom of Cambodia at the closing session of the Geneva Conference will easily believe this. We now quote their statements as follows:

    Statement of the Government of the Kingdom of Laos: "The Government of the Kingdom of Laos will not conclude any agreement with other countries if this agreement includes the obligation to join a military alliance that is inconsistent with the principles of the United Nations Charter or the principles of the ceasefire agreement, or includes the obligation to establish bases for foreign military forces on Laotian territory when its security is not threatened..."

    Statement of the Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia: "The Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia will not conclude any agreement with other countries if this agreement includes the obligation to join a military alliance that is inconsistent with the principles of the United Nations Charter or includes the obligation to establish bases for foreign military forces on Cambodian territory when its security is not threatened..."

    I think these statements are very clear and unambiguous. Therefore, according to news agency reports, British Foreign Secretary Eden made the following statement in the House of Commons on July 22: "It is perfectly clear and easily understood that none of these three countries may allow foreign military bases to be established on their territory, nor may they join any military alliance."

    In addition to many other pieces of evidence, this evidence is sufficient to show that Mr. Dulles's interpretation is wrong and dangerous, and serves the policy pursued by the American aggressor bloc, which aims to undermine the Geneva Accords, namely, to undermine the cessation of hostilities and the restoration of peace in Indochina, and to establish an aggressive bloc in Southeast Asia, threatening peace and security in Southeast Asia and the world.

    The Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, like all peace-loving peoples and governments, especially the peace-loving peoples and governments of Asia and Southeast Asia, firmly oppose the establishment of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, because it is in reality an organization serving US interference in Southeast Asia, aimed at undermining the implementation of the Geneva Accords, thereby endangering the peace that is being restored in Indochina.

    关于印度支那问题
    范文同答意大利“团结报”记者问
    【新华社六日讯】据越南通讯社北越五日讯：越南民主共和国副总理兼外交部部长范文同答复了意大利共产党机关报“团结报”记者向他提出的一些问题。问题和答复如下：
    问：在日内瓦会议签订的关于印度支那问题的协定是全世界和平事业的一个巨大的胜利。在这样一种具有普遍意义的胜利的范围中，你是否可以指出日内瓦协定给越南民主共和国和越南人民的斗争以及给寮国人民和高棉人民的斗争带来了那些具体的收获？
    答：在日内瓦签订的协定以及会议的最后宣言停止了越南、老挝和柬埔寨的敌对行动，并有助于在承认越南、老挝和柬埔寨人民的民族权利的基础上恢复印度支那和平。
    这已经在日内瓦会议最后宣言的条款中作了明确的规定。我们引述一些条款如下：
    最后宣言第二条：“会议庆幸在柬埔寨、老挝和越南的敌对行动的结束。会议坚信：本宣言和各项停止敌对行动协定中所规定的条款的实施，将使柬埔寨、老挝和越南从此能够完全独立自主地在国际的和平大家庭中起它们的作用。”
    最后宣言第十一条：“会议注意到法国政府的声明，即法国政府将在尊重柬埔寨、老挝和越南三国的独立、主权、统一和领土完整的基础上，来解决有关恢复和巩固柬埔寨、老挝和越南的和平的一切问题。”
    最后宣言第十二条：“日内瓦会议的每个与会国家在对柬埔寨、老挝和越南三国的关系上，保证尊重上述各国的主权、独立、统一和领土完整，并对其内政不予任何干涉。”
    因此，日内瓦协定以及会议的最后宣言意味着国际上对越南、老挝和柬埔寨人民的合法愿望的承认，这种愿望已由越南民主共和国代表团在日内瓦会议上的一般性发言的序言中表示如下：“越南民主共和国的人民和政府的基本立场是：和平、独立、统一和民主。”
    因此，在日内瓦签订的协定和会议的最后宣言首先是越南人民、越南民主共和国以及老挝和柬埔寨人民的巨大胜利；它们也是所有为民族解放而斗争的人民的重大胜利。
    同时，日内瓦会议的良好结果是全世界和平事业的一个巨大成就。
    问：你认为，在印度支那停止敌对行动之后接着实行日内瓦协定所规定的政治措施的条件是什么？你觉得在实行这种政治措施方面，可能有什么障碍？
    答：为了在印度支那停止敌对行动之后接着实行日内瓦协定所规定的政治措施，主要条件如下：
      （一）签字国和与会国忠实地、严格地和彻底地履行协定和会议的最后宣言中的一切规定。为此，在越南民主共和国政府和法国政府之间建立并发展彼此信任和友好的关系是特别重要的，这不仅对于正确履行停止敌对行动协定是必要的，而且对于在平等、互利的基础上重新建立两国之间的正常关系也是必要的。
      （二）从北部到南部的全体越南人民，坚决地和成功地为忠实地和严格地执行日内瓦会议最后宣言第六条和第七条关于以和平和民主的方法及通过自由和民主的普选实现越南统一的规定而斗争。
    越南民主共和国政府一切国内和国外的政策，都是针对着这样的基本目标，即为争取越南的完全解放以及为争取巩固越南和印度支那的稳定而持久的和平而奋斗。
    那些住在暂时指定作为法国远征军集结地区的越南南部的越南人民，将努力争取创造有利于建立
  一个代表民族愿望的政府的形势和条件，以便用选举的办法统一国家。
    我认为实行这些政治措施的主要障碍，是美国侵略集团的干涉政策，他们和他们的代理人吴庭艳集团一起想尽各种办法来破坏日内瓦协定的履行。关于这一点，必须指出他们强迫迁移北部的越南人的计划，他们的“美援”计划，他们要建立所谓东南亚公约组织的计划。
      因此，越南人民、越南民主共和国和印度支那人民为争取完全履行协定以及为争取政治问题的圆满解决而进行的斗争，就是反对美帝国主义者的干涉和反对他们的走狗，以粉碎他们破坏协定的履行的阴谋的斗争。
    问：美国国务卿杜勒斯七月二十三日在一个记者招待会上说，美国政府认为，可以把柬埔寨，或许也可以把老挝包括在东南亚军事公约的草案中。你是否认为这个意见是符合日内瓦协定的？
      答：我认为美国国务卿杜勒斯先生所说美国政府认为可以把柬埔寨或许也可以把老挝包括在东南亚军事公约草案中的声明，不仅和日内瓦协定以及会议的最后宣言不相符合，而且是和这些文件的字句和精神完全背道而驰的。
    任何人在读过老挝王国和柬埔寨王国政府在日内瓦会议的闭幕会上所发表的声明以后，都会很容易地相信这一点。我们现在把它们的声明引述如下：
    老挝王国政府的声明：“老挝王国政府将不与其他国家缔结任何协定，如果此项协定包括使老挝王国政府参加不符合联合国宪章原则的或停止敌对行动协定原则的军事同盟的义务，或包括当其安全不受威胁时在老挝领土上为外国军事力量建立基地的义务。……”
    柬埔寨王国政府的声明：“柬埔寨王国政府将不与其他国家缔结任何协定，如果此项协定包括使柬埔寨王国政府参加不符合联合国宪章原则的军事同盟的义务，或包括当其安全不受威胁时在柬埔寨领土上为外国军事力量建立基地的义务。……”
    我认为这些声明都十分清楚并且是不容置疑的。因此，据通讯社的报道，英国外交大臣艾登先生七月二十二日在下院发表了以下的声明：“这是十分清楚和容易理解的，这三个国家中的任何一国都不得容许在它们的领土上建立外国军事基地，也不得参加任何军事联盟”。
    除了许多其他的证据以外，这一些证据已足以表明，杜勒斯先生的解释是错误的和危险的，这是为美国侵略集团所奉行的政策服务的，其目的在于破坏日内瓦协定，即破坏敌对行动的停止和印度支那和平的恢复，并且在东南亚建立侵略集团，威胁东南亚和全世界的和平与安全。
    越南人民和越南民主共和国政府，像一切爱好和平的人民和政府，特别是亚洲和东南亚的爱好和平的人民和政府一样，坚决反对建立东南亚公约组织，因为它实际上就是为美国干涉东南亚服务的一种组织，其目的在于破坏日内瓦协定的实施，因而危及正在印度支那恢复中的和平。
