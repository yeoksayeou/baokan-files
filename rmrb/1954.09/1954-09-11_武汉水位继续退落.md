Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, September 9th: The past week has seen a receding flood in Wuhan. At the Wuhan Customs pier, the old hydrological markers that were submerged by the floodwaters have reappeared. The hydrological traces left on the outside of the riverside flood defenses, marking this year's highest water level, are now more than one meter above the surface. Many sections of the levee now have their flood-fighting sub-dikes standing more than two meters above the water. According to reports from the hydrological station, as of 5:00 PM on September 9th, the water level of the Yangtze River at Wuhan Customs had fallen to 28.68 meters, a drop of 1.05 meters from the peak of 29.73 meters recorded on August 19th of this year. People standing on the riverside flood defenses, observing the current water level, see that it is still fully 4 decimeters higher than the highest water level in nearly a century, 28.28 meters in 1931, as marked on the Wuhan Customs wall. It is also 2.30 meters above the warning level for Wuhan Customs.

The Wuhan city dikes withstood the test of autumn gales this week. On the nights of the 6th and 7th, Wuhan experienced sustained northeasterly winds of force four to five, with wind forces reaching six on the Zhanggong Dike. This duration was unprecedented in July and August. Thanks to the significant wave-breaking effect of the 95-li of wave-dissipating wooden rafts that had already been reinforced, and the efforts of the flood control personnel along the dikes, no major emergencies occurred.

The Wuhan flood control army, striving for complete and final victory in this year's flood control struggle, is carrying out the post-flood control project of further reinforcing the dikes. This project is larger in scale than the fifth phase. Special attention is also being paid to combining it with Wuhan's long-term levee maintenance plan, to complete many projects that must be finished before the dry season.

### 武汉水位继续退落

    武汉水位继续退落
    【新华社武汉九日电】近一周来，武汉呈现一片退水的景象。在武汉关江边，原来被洪水淹没了的旧水文标尺已经露出了水面。沿江防水墙外遗留下来的今年最高水位的水文痕迹已经高出水面一公尺多了。许多堤段上原来抵挡洪水的子埝，已经比水面高出两公尺多了。根据水文站的报告，到九日下午五时，武汉关长江的水位已落至二八点六八公尺，比今年八月十九日的最高水位二九点七三公尺下落了一公尺另五公分。人们站在沿江防水墙上，察看现在的水位，和武汉关墙上刻着的近百年来最高水位、一九三一年的二八点二八公尺比较整整还高出四公寸。比武汉关的警戒水位，更高出了二点三零公尺。
    武汉市堤防在这一周内经受了秋季大风的考验。在六日和七日两个夜晚，武汉整夜起着四级到五级的东北风，在张公堤上，风力达到六级。这在七、八月份，是没有持续过这样久的。由于已经加固的九十五华里的防浪木排起了显著的破浪作用，以及沿堤防汛人员的努力，没有发生重大险情。
    武汉市防汛大军为了争取今年防汛斗争的完全胜利和最后胜利，正在进行防汛后期继续加固堤防的工程。这次工程，其规模比第五期还大。并且特别注意结合武汉市的培修堤防的长远计划，完成枯水季节前必须完成的许多工程。
