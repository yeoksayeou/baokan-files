    The Magnificent Soviet Exhibition Hall
    By our reporters Yu Ming and Pei Lan
    Leaving Beijing through Xizhimen, the dazzling gilded iron tower of the Soviet Exhibition Hall comes into view. The red five-pointed star at the top of the tower, like the red ruby on the high tower of the Moscow Kremlin, attracts people's attention. On the front of the tower is the golden emblem of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and on all four sides are the four Russian letters "CCCP" in gold; at the four corners of the tower are four outward-radiating flying arches, and in the middle of the flying arches and on the top of the arched columns are copper-made sickles, hammers, and five-pointed stars, as well as laurel leaves symbolizing honor, and ears of wheat symbolizing labor. The total height of the tower and the central hall is much higher than the White Pagoda in Beihai Park. This spire is the center of the entire exhibition hall, magnificent and simple; it displays the architectural art of the Soviet people and expresses the happiness and hope of the Soviet people.
    Walking into the grand plaza of the Soviet Exhibition Hall, you see the central hub of the exhibition hall—the central hall and its eighteen arches on both sides, with the national emblems of the sixteen Soviet republics hanging on sixteen of the arches. The central hall and the arches have simple walls with only key decorations, which make the tower-shaped building even more magnificent.
    In the tall central hall, the pillars are made of marble, and the large dome is decorated with various patterns carved in plaster. In the very center is a silver-white chandelier weighing more than a ton and 12 meters high. Through three gilded red doors, you can reach the Industry Pavilion, the Culture Pavilion, and the Agriculture Pavilion. The four niches separated by the red doors will have four large murals. One of them depicts the heart of the Soviet Union that people yearn for—the Moscow Kremlin; the second depicts Soviet collective farm members harvesting crops in the fields with combine harvesters, with factory chimneys faintly visible in the picture; the third mural shows the new buildings of Moscow University and the Soviet male and female students studying here; the fourth depicts the seaside, and the Soviet working people recuperating in comfortable sanatoriums. After admiring such rich decorations in the central hall, we felt as if we had seen the station architecture of the Moscow subway, and as if we had seen the life of the Soviet people.
    The Industry Pavilion is located to the north of the central hall, consisting of twelve large arches and thin-shell roofs. The top of the arch is 19.55 meters above the ground, with a span of 32 meters, and a corridor 8 meters wide from east to west. The hall is spacious and bright, with golden plaster decorations on the north and south walls. On the steps on the north side, statues of the great revolutionary teachers Lenin and Stalin will be erected. After seeing the complex and huge heavy industrial machines and the exquisite light industrial products here, we naturally think that these great achievements are inseparable from the shining names of Lenin and Stalin.
    Going west from the central hall is the Agriculture Pavilion, whose west side is connected to the towering domed hall. Through this gate hall, you can go south to the Cinema and north to the Restaurant. These buildings constitute the west wing of the exhibition hall. In the spacious exhibition room of the Agriculture Pavilion, the walls and pillars are light green and dark green, and many bronze hanging lamps are suspended from the top. Various Soviet agricultural products will be exhibited here. The four large pillars in the domed hall are painted with gold thread patterns, and large green silk screens are hung on the four walls, on which are painted golden fruits, branches, which contrast with the yellow walls and crimson exhibition stands, making it particularly beautiful. This hall will exhibit various Soviet agricultural products, such as various wines and canned foods.
    The south end of the domed hall leads to the Cinema and the lounge. The roof of the Cinema is also arched, with a span of 18 meters, and the hall can accommodate more than 900 spectators. The beautiful colored paintings on the ceiling of the hall are a bit like the caissons of our country; the Ruyi patterns on the column heads and the gold-plated flowers on the velvet curtains are our country's handicrafts. These decorations make the architecture of the Cinema more magnificent.
    To the north of the domed hall is the Moscow Restaurant. The green marble walls with natural patterns in the restaurant, the patterns on the ceiling composed of pine needles, pine cones, and snowflakes, the reliefs of hunters and arctic deer on the walls, and the pillars inlaid with copper pine branches and birds and beasts, all express the mood of the northern forests of the Soviet Union, making people feel quiet and lovely. Visitors here will taste delicious Soviet food. The corridor in the northwest of the restaurant is a coffee bar, and the walls are decorated with typical Russian-style patterns.
    Going east from the central hall is the Culture Pavilion. Several exhibition rooms, lounges, and small exhibition halls constitute the east wing of the exhibition hall. Exhibits related to Soviet culture, education, literature, painting, sculpture, crafts, and architecture will be displayed here. The decoration of the Soviet Painting Exhibition Room is all gray, and although there are patterns on the column heads, they are not eye-catching. It sets off the picture, allowing the audience to focus on appreciating the famous paintings. The other two exhibition rooms are also decorated according to the characteristics of the exhibits. Behind the Culture Pavilion is a small exhibition hall. Entering this exhibition hall, one feels as if one is in an ancient Russian folk residence: all the decoration is wooden, and the exquisite carvings and decorations, and the various Soviet embroidery, lace, jewelry, jade, etc. that will be exhibited, will give people a deep impression. The main color of the lobby of the Culture Pavilion is red, and the plaster decorations on the dome are particularly beautiful. A model of the architecture of Moscow University will be exhibited here. Comparing it with the model of the Soviet Exhibition Hall, visitors will know the greatness of the architecture of Moscow University.
    At the rear of the exhibition hall is the Soviet-style open-air theater. There are no patterns on the pillars here. It is naturally combined with the tall and majestic Industry Pavilion in front and the gardens and the artificial lake behind the theater, which will be built on both sides, and it appears simple and plain. On both sides of the rear of the open-air theater, there are two Chinese-style pagodas. From the outside, they seem to be an inseparable part of the entire building, but in fact they are two chimneys. Soviet architects beautified the chimneys, which have always been considered difficult to handle in architecture.
    After visiting the entire exhibition hall, we feel that each pavilion and each exhibition room has a different style and decoration. The layout of each part of the building is also very reasonable, making visitors feel convenient and comfortable. For example, at the entrance of the exhibition hall, there is a wide square and a fountain, which gives people a comfortable and light feeling when passing through here. The architects have arranged the way forward for the visitors, and people can choose the exhibition hall they want to visit according to their own wishes. Visitors can go to the Cinema or the open-air theater to enjoy Soviet movies and Soviet folk dances; they can go to the lounge to talk about their viewing experience; they can also take a walk in the garden behind the exhibition hall, or row a boat on the artificial lake; people can also go to the restaurant to taste Soviet cuisine. We deeply realized here how an architect should always think for the masses, and we also truly realized Stalin's "care for people."
    The architectural experts of the Soviet Exhibition Hall, corresponding academician of the Soviet Academy of Architecture, winner of the Stalin Prize, director of the First Main Road Studio of Moscow, architect Andreyev, leader of the architect group of the First Main Road Studio of Moscow, Kislova, winner of the Stalin Prize, chief engineer of the First Main Road Studio of Moscow, Gokhman, manager of the Moscow Architectural Trust, and construction engineer Toroptsev, conveyed the great image of the Soviet people and their thoughts and feelings to our people through the construction of the exhibition hall. At the same time, they fully utilized our country's architectural art. In the exhibition hall, we can not only see buildings representing the Soviet national form, but also see architectural images familiar to our people. When we see the gold-plated flower pillars in the exhibition hall, it is as if we are seeing the flower pillars inside the Temple of Heaven in Beijing. The flower decorations on the ceiling of the exhibition hall's Cinema are very similar to the colored paintings of the caissons of the Forbidden City. There are also many flower decorations, such as the diamond window flowers on the windows, which are very familiar to us. We saw Chinese-style pagodas, lion heads by the small fountain, Ruyi column heads, etc., combined very naturally and harmoniously with the magnificent Soviet buildings. The architecture of this exhibition hall fully reflects the common hopes and wishes of the people of China and the Soviet Union, and it will further promote the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union.

    宏伟的苏联展览馆
    本报记者　于明　培蓝
    出北京的西直门，耀眼的苏联展览馆的镏金铁塔，就出现在我们的眼前了。塔顶的红五星，好像莫斯科克里姆林宫高塔上的红宝石一样，吸引着人们的注意。塔身的正面有金光闪闪的苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的国徽，四面有金色的“CCCP”四个俄文字母；塔身的四角又有四个向外放射的飞拱，在飞拱中间和拱柱顶上，有铜制的镰刀、锤子和五角星，有象征荣誉的桂树叶子，象征劳动的麦穗等。全塔的高度和中央大厅的高度加在一起，比北海公园的白塔还要高出很多。这座尖塔是整个展览馆的中心，雄伟、朴素；它显示了苏联人民的建筑艺术，表达了苏联人民的幸福和希望。
    走进苏联展览馆的大广场，就看到了展览馆的中心枢纽——中央大厅和它两旁的十八个拱门，其中十六个拱门上悬挂着苏联十六个加盟共和国的国徽。中央大厅和拱门，墙面朴素，只作重点雕饰，它把塔形建筑衬托得更为宏伟。
    高大的中央大厅里，柱子都用大理石砌成，大圆穹顶上，有用石膏雕刻的各种花纹。正中间有一盏一吨多重、十二公尺高的银白色大挂灯。通过三个镶金花的大红门，可到工业馆、文化馆和农业馆。与大红门间隔的四个壁龛内将有四幅大的壁画，其中之一画的是令人向往的苏联的心脏——莫斯科的克里姆林宫，第二幅画的是苏联集体农庄庄员正在田野里开动收割机收割庄稼的情景，画图上隐隐出现了工厂的烟囱；第三幅壁画上，有莫斯科大学的新建筑和在这里学习的苏联男女学生；第四幅画的是海滨，以及在舒畅的疗养所休养的苏联劳动人民。我们在中央大厅欣赏了这样丰富的装饰以后，就好像看到了莫斯科地下铁道的车站建筑一样，就好像看到了苏联人民的生活。
    工业馆在中央大厅的北边，它由十二个大圆拱和薄壳顶所组成，拱顶离地面十九点五五公尺，跨度三十二公尺，东西有八公尺宽的走廊。馆内宽敞明朗，南北墙壁上装饰着金黄色的石膏花饰，北面的台阶上，将竖立起伟大的革命导师列宁和斯大林的雕像。在这里看完了复杂巨大的重工业机器，以及精细的轻工业品以后，我们很自然地想到，这些伟大的成就是和列宁、斯大林的光辉名字分不开的。
    由中央大厅西行，是农业馆，它的西部和高耸的圆顶厅相连。通过这个门厅，往南可到电影馆，往北可到餐厅。这些建筑，构成了展览馆的西翼。农业馆宽大的展览室里，墙壁和柱子都是浅绿和深绿色，许多古铜色的挂灯高悬顶空。这里将展出苏联各种各样的农业生产品。圆顶厅内的四大圆柱上，画着沥粉金线的花纹，四壁挂上了绿色丝绸的大幅画面，上边画着金黄色的果品、树枝，和黄色墙壁、绛色的展览架互相衬托，显得格外美观。这个厅内将展览苏联的各种农产制造品，如各色酿酒和罐头食品等。
    圆顶厅的南端通往电影馆和休息厅。电影馆的屋顶也是圆拱，跨度为十八公尺，馆内可容九百多个观众。馆内天花板上美丽的彩画，有点像我国的藻井；在柱头上有我国的如意花纹，丝绒幕上的盘金花，则是我国的手工艺品。这些装饰，使电影馆的建筑显得更加瑰丽。
    圆顶厅往北是莫斯科餐厅。餐厅里带有自然花纹的绿色大理石墙面，天花板上由松叶、松果和雪花组成的图案，壁上打猎者和寒带鹿的浮雕，用铜制松树枝和飞禽走兽镶嵌的柱子，都表现了苏联北方森林里的情调，使人感到清静可爱。参观的人们，在这里将尝到苏联美味的食物。餐厅西北部的走廊是咖啡座，墙面上装饰着典型的俄罗斯风格的花纹。
    从中央大厅往东便是文化馆。几个展览室、休息厅和小型展览厅的建筑，组成了展览馆的东翼。这里将陈列有关苏联文化教育、文学、绘画、雕刻、工艺和建筑等各方面的展品。苏联名画展览室的装饰都是灰色，柱头虽有花纹，但并不触目，它衬托了画面，使观众专注于欣赏名画。另外两个展览室，也根据展览品的特点，进行了装饰。文化馆的后面，是一个小型展览厅，一走进这个展览厅，使人好像置身于古老的俄罗斯民间住宅里一样：一切装修都是木制的，精致的雕刻和花饰，和将要展出的苏联各种刺绣、花边、珠宝玉器等，都将给人以深刻的印象。文化馆的门厅，以红色为主要色调，穹顶上的石膏花饰，显得特别美丽。这里将展出莫斯科大学的建筑模型，把它和展出的苏联展览馆模型比较一下，参观者就能知道莫斯科大学建筑的伟大了。
    展览馆的后部，便是苏联式的露天剧场，这里柱子上没有任何花纹，它和前面高大雄伟的工业馆和两旁即将修建起来的花园、剧场后面的人工湖自然地结合起来，显得简朴、素淡。在露天剧场后部的两旁，有两个中国式的塔，从外形看来好像是和整个建筑不可分割的一部分，但是实际上它是两个烟囱。苏联建筑师把建筑中一向认为难于处理的烟囱，在这里予以美化了。
    参观整个展览馆的建筑以后，我们感到每个馆、每个展览室，都具有不同的格调和雕饰。建筑物各个部分的布局，也十分合理，使参观者感到方便、安适。譬如，一进展览馆的大门，就是宽阔的广场和喷水池，人们经过这里时，便产生一种舒畅、轻快的感觉。建筑师们为参观者安排了前进的道路，人们可按自己的意愿选择要参观的展览馆。参观者将可到电影馆或露天剧场，欣赏苏联的电影和苏联的民间舞蹈；可以到休息厅交谈观赏的心得；也可以在展览馆后面的花园里散步，在人工湖上划船；人们还可以到餐厅里尝尝苏联大菜。我们在这里深深体会到一个建筑师应该如何处处为群众设想，我们也真切地体会到了斯大林式的“对人的关怀”。
    苏联展览馆的建筑专家，苏联建筑科学院通讯院士、斯大林奖金获得者、莫斯科市第一干道工作室主任、建筑师安德烈耶夫，莫斯科市第一干道工作室建筑师组组长基斯洛娃和斯大林奖金获得者、莫斯科市第一干道工作室总工程师郭赫曼，莫斯科建筑托拉斯经理、施工工程师托罗普册夫，通过展览馆的建筑，把苏联人民伟大的形象和他们的思想感情，传达给了我国人民。同时，他们充分运用了我国的建筑艺术。我们在展览馆里，不但可以看到代表苏联民族形式的建筑，而且还能够看到为我国人民所熟习的建筑形象。我们看到展览馆内沥粉贴金的花柱子时，就像是看到了北京天坛里边的花柱子一样。展览馆电影馆的天花板的花饰，和故宫藻井的彩画很相像。还有许多花饰，如窗子上的菱窗花等等，都是我们很熟习的。我们看到了中国式的宝塔、小喷水池边的狮子头、如意柱头等，和苏联宏伟的建筑物，结合得都非常自然、协调。这个展览馆的建筑，充分反映了中苏两国人民共同的希望和意愿，它将会更进一步促进中苏两国人民的友谊。（附图片）
