    Tianjin Concludes Constitution Draft Propaganda and Discussion
    Actively Welcoming the Birth of China's First Constitution
   [Our Newspaper] The activity of studying and discussing the draft constitution by people from all walks of life in Tianjin has been going on for two and a half months, and has now ended, basically achieving the goal of being known to every household. According to incomplete statistics, more than one million people in the city directly heard the explanatory reports on the draft constitution, of which more than 900,000 participated in the discussion. During the discussion, people from all walks of life showed high political enthusiasm and, with the attitude of masters of the country, fully put forward supplementary and revision opinions on the draft constitution. These opinions have been compiled and sorted out by the Tianjin Constitution Draft Discussion Committee, and finally summarized into 503 items, which have been submitted to the Constitution Drafting Committee of the People's Republic of China for processing.
    Since the promulgation of the draft constitution, people from all walks of life in Tianjin have begun to study and discuss it. From June 15th to early July, people from all walks of life mainly listened to explanations on the draft constitution through attending report meetings and other means, and conducted seminars and discussions to initially understand the significance of formulating the constitution, the basic spirit and content of the draft constitution. From mid-July to early August was a stage of in-depth study and discussion. After this stage, people from all walks of life realized the relationship between the formulation of the constitution and the realization of the general task of the state's transition period, and the relationship between ensuring the construction of a socialist society, the significance of formulating the constitution for consolidating the people's democratic system, and the consistency of the rights and obligations of citizens stipulated in the draft constitution; many people actively put forward supplementary and revision opinions on the draft constitution. From mid-August to the end of August was the final stage, and people from all walks of life further deepened the discussion and generally put forward supplementary and revision opinions on the draft constitution. During the Tianjin Municipal People's Congress meeting held during this period, the representatives listened to the report of the Tianjin Constitution Draft Discussion Committee on the publicity and discussion of the draft constitution. After the meeting, in conjunction with the representatives' communication of the resolution of the conference, many units held seminars and put forward supplementary and revision opinions on the draft constitution item by item.
    More than 90% of the employees of Tianjin's state-owned and local state-owned factories participated in the item-by-item discussion of the draft constitution; more than 79,000 cadres of the organs also participated in such discussions. Suburban farmers, various democratic parties, cultural and educational circles, business circles, ethnic minorities, religious circles, and street residents also conducted discussions and put forward their own opinions. The workers of the Qiu Guanghe team, Class B and Class C of the small rolling mill workshop of the No. 1 branch of Tianjin Steel Plant, a model team, used their spare time to discuss four times in a row. They carefully discussed all 106 articles of the draft constitution and put forward 14 supplementary and revision opinions. Worker Li Wanyao said: "Every word of the draft constitution is related to us, and we need to earnestly implement it into practical action." Zhou Pu, a typist at Zhonghua Match Factory, was excited when the party branch of the factory notified him to attend the draft constitution discussion meeting. He said: "We workers are truly the masters of our own affairs. I must act like a master and put forward opinions that are beneficial to the working class and the interests of the people of the whole country." He carefully read the draft constitution twice in his spare time, and put forward five opinions at the meeting. He said, "Article 18 of the draft constitution stipulates that all state organ workers must be loyal to the people's democratic system. The meaning of 'loyal' is affirmative, and the 'effort' in the last sentence 'strive to serve the people' must also be affirmative. Everyone must check whether they are truly striving to serve the people." Other employees also agreed with his opinion. Zhang Yupeng, an old rolling mill worker at the No. 1 branch of Tianjin Steel Plant, based on the specific fact that Sun Wenxiu's improvement of the small rolling mill roll groove type was successful and was encouraged by the state, believed that the sentence "The state encourages the initiative and creativity of citizens in labor" should be revised to "The state encourages citizens to develop initiative and creativity in labor." He said: "This revision will better show that our country attaches great importance to giving full play to the people's labor initiative and creativity." Many workers agreed with his view. Chen Shuyun, a worker at the jointly owned synthetic rubber factory, suggested that the preamble of the draft constitution should stipulate that every citizen must promote the spirit of hard work and simplicity during the transition period and strive for the country's socialist industrialization.
    Many people recalled their lives of oppression, exploitation and displacement in the old society, and they felt that without the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, they would not be where they are today. At the symposium of members of the handicraft production cooperatives in the Fifth District of Tianjin, many people suggested that the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao should be particularly emphasized in China's first constitution. Farmers in the suburbs of Tianjin paid special attention to the provisions of Article 7 of the draft constitution. Many cooperative members and mutual aid group members repeatedly discussed the benefits of organizing together. Many village cadres and farmers in the southern suburbs of Tianjin suggested that the "main road" in the second paragraph of Article 7, "and take the development of production cooperatives as the main road for transforming individual agriculture and individual handicraft industry," should be changed to "the only road."
    People from all walks of life put forward active opinions on the draft constitution. For example, Imam Chen Wenbin suggested that the provision in Article 3 of the draft constitution, "Prohibition of discrimination and oppression against any ethnic group," be changed to "Prohibition of discrimination and oppression among ethnic groups." Some people in the religious circles suggested that the phrase "Our various ethnic groups have united into a free and equal family of nationalities" in the fifth paragraph of the preamble of the draft constitution should preferably add the four words "friendly cooperation" after "free and equal."
    Through studying and discussing the draft constitution, the people of Tianjin have further improved their socialist consciousness. Everyone has once again deeply experienced the superiority of our country's people's democratic system, realized that our country's constitution belongs to the socialist type, and from the various provisions of the draft constitution, they have more clearly defined the specific path to steadily transition to a socialist society under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, thus further strengthening their determination and confidence to work hard to build our country into a great socialist country. At present, the people of Tianjin are using practical actions to implement the specific tasks determined by the first meeting of the first Tianjin Municipal People's Congress, and are using this to welcome the convening of the National People's Congress and the birth of the first constitution of the People's Republic of China.

    天津宣传和讨论宪法草案结束
    正以实际行动迎接我国第一部宪法的诞生
   【本报讯】天津市各界人民进行学习和讨论宪法草案的活动，连续进行了两个半月，现在已经结束，基本上达到了家喻户晓。根据不完全的统计，全市有一百多万人直接听到了关于宪法草案的讲解报告，其中九十多万人参加了讨论。在讨论中，各界人民表现了高度的政治热情，用国家主人翁的态度，充分地对宪法草案提出了补充和修改意见。这些意见已由天津市宪法草案讨论委员会汇集整理，最后共综合为五百零三条，并已经报送中华人民共和国宪法起草委员会处理。
    从宪法草案公布以后，天津市各界人民便开始了学习和讨论。六月十五日到七月初旬这一阶段，各界人民主要是通过参加报告会等方式，听取关于宪法草案的解释，并进行座谈和讨论，初步了解了制定宪法的意义、宪法草案的基本精神和内容。七月中旬到八月上旬是深入学习和讨论的阶段。经过这一阶段以后，各界人民认识到制定宪法和实现国家过渡时期总任务的关系、和保证建成社会主义社会的关系，认识到制定宪法对巩固人民民主制度的意义，以及宪法草案规定的公民权利和义务的一致性；许多人并积极提出了对宪法草案的补充和修改意见。八月中旬到八月底是最后一阶段，各界人民进一步深入展开讨论，并普遍对宪法草案提出补充和修改意见。在这期间举行的天津市人民代表大会会议上，代表们听取了天津市宪法草案讨论委员会关于宪法草案宣传和讨论工作的报告。会后结合代表们的传达大会决议，许多单位召开了座谈会，又逐条的对宪法草案提出补充和修改意见。
    天津国营和地方国营工厂的职工，有百分之九十以上参加了对宪法草案的逐条讨论；机关干部七万九千多人也参加了这样的讨论。郊区农民、各民主党派、文化教育界、工商界、少数民族、宗教界和街道居民等，也都进行了讨论并提出了自己的意见。天津市模范小组、国营天津钢厂一分厂小型轧钢车间邱光和小组乙班和丙班的工人们，曾经利用下班时间连续讨论了四次，他们对宪法草案的一百零六条都认真地作了讨论，并提出了十四条补充和修改意见。工人李万尧说：“宪法草案的每一个字都和我们有关系，我们需要好好把它贯彻到实际行动中去。”中华火柴厂打字员周璞在该厂党总支通知他参加宪法草案讨论会的时候，他激动地说：“我们工人真是当家作主了。我一定拿出主人翁的样子来，把有利于工人阶级和全国人民利益的意见提出来。”他在业余时间把宪法草案仔细地看了两遍，会上他提出了五点意见。他说到“宪法草案第十八条规定，一切国家机关工作人员必须效忠人民民主制度，‘效忠’的意思是肯定的，条文最后一句‘努力为人民服务’的‘努力’也必须是肯定的，人人都要检查是否真正努力为人民服务。”其他职工也同意他的意见。天津钢厂一分厂老轧钢工人张玉鹏根据该厂孙文秀改进小型轧钢机轧辊槽型成功，受到国家鼓励的具体事实，认为“国家鼓励公民在劳动中的积极性和创造性”这句话，修改为“国家鼓励公民在劳动中发挥积极性和创造性”比较好。他说：“这样修改一下，就更能表示我们国家是非常重视发挥人民的劳动积极性和创造性的。”很多工人同意他的看法。公私合营合成橡胶厂工人陈淑云建议在宪法草案序言中规定：每个公民在过渡时期必须发扬艰苦朴素的精神，为国家的社会主义工业化而奋斗。
    不少人回忆起了他们在旧社会遭受压迫、剥削和颠沛流离的生活，他们觉得没有共产党和毛主席，自己就没有今天。在天津市五区手工业生产合作社社员座谈会上，许多人建议在我国第一部宪法中，应该特别强调出共产党和毛主席的领导。天津市郊区农民对宪法草案第七条的规定特别注意。很多合作社社员和互助组组员联系组织起来以后得到的好处，反复进行了讨论。天津市南郊区许多村干部和农民都建议把第七条第二款的“并且以发展生产合作社为改造个体农业和个体手工业的主要道路”中的“主要道路”改为“唯一道路”。
    各界人士对宪法草案都提出了积极的意见。如阿訇陈文彬建议，宪法草案第三条中“禁止对任何民族的歧视和压迫”的规定改为“禁止各民族间的歧视和压迫”。宗教界有的人建议：宪法草案序言第五段“我国各民族已经团结成为一个自由平等的民族大家庭”一句中在“自由平等”下面最好加“友爱合作”四字。
    经过学习和讨论宪法草案，天津市人民进一步提高了社会主义觉悟。大家又一次深刻地体验到我国人民民主制度的优越性，认识到我国的宪法是属于社会主义类型的，并从宪法草案的各项规定中，更明确了在共产党和人民政府领导下稳步过渡到社会主义社会的具体道路，因而更加增强了为把我国建设成一个伟大的社会主义国家而努力的决心和信心。目前，天津市人民正在用实际行动贯彻执行天津市第一届人民代表大会第一次会议确定的具体任务，并以此迎接全国人民代表大会会议的召开和中华人民共和国第一部宪法的诞生。
