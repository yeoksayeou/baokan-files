    Fighting the Flood

    Since the end of June, the Changjiang Daily has launched a continuous and focused flood prevention campaign as the people of Wuhan fought a tense battle against a flood unseen in a century. The newspaper published a series of editorials, short commentaries, and flood prevention publicity materials, conducting relatively in-depth ideological mobilization among the masses. On the one hand, it reminded people that the threat of the flood was extremely serious, and we must not allow ourselves to be negligent, careless, or complacent; on the other hand, it pointed out that under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and on the basis of the increased awareness of the masses, we also had the basic favorable conditions to overcome the flood. The newspaper called on people to concentrate all their efforts to accelerate the completion of flood prevention projects, consolidate the achievements already made, and strive for the final victory. It also made serious criticisms of ideas and practices that dispersed forces, delayed opportunities, and promoted complacency and negligence. In this campaign, the Changjiang Daily attached great importance to opinion work, analyzing and explaining the Party's policies and the situation of flood prevention work from all aspects. This greatly improved people's understanding and established a solid ideological foundation for consolidating the dikes and defeating the flood.

    In this flood prevention struggle, the Changjiang Daily continuously reported on the nationwide support for local flood prevention work, as well as the heroic deeds of the people of Wuhan in repairing dikes, carrying out emergency rescue work, protecting the dikes, engaging in arduous struggles against the flood, and staying ahead of the flood. One report stated: Wooden boxes marked with "Beijing," "Guanting Reservoir," "Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission," and "Shenyang Water Pump Factory" were constantly unloaded from trucks. More and more water pumps were transported to the Zhanggong Dike to drain the waterlogged areas inside the dike. More reports reflected the fact that a construction worker broke a finger after being hit by a large stone during the rescue operation, but he silently endured the pain and insisted on working. A kilometer-long section of the wave-proof reed barrier on the Zhanggong Dike was damaged. Rows of soldiers and workers, with willow branches hanging on their bodies and holding hands, stood in the water, blocking the impact of the waves on the dike body and buying time to quickly repair the wave-proof equipment. The workers participating in flood prevention said: "No matter how many difficulties there are, they can't compare to our ingenuity; no matter how high the water level is, it's not as high as our enthusiasm; no matter how heavy the rain is, it's not as great as our determination." People on the front lines of flood prevention were repairing dikes and carrying out emergency rescue work, while people in the rear were persisting in production and supporting the front lines. These facts reported by the newspaper profoundly educated the broad masses of the people, making them realize the brilliance and strength of the Party's leadership, the superiority of our country's people's democratic system, and the greatness of the people's own power. This understanding has already generated and will continue to generate tremendous material power to overcome the flood.

    The Changjiang Daily also promptly answered some questions raised by the masses regarding flood prevention work. For example, the newspaper published a Q&A with the spokesperson of the Wuhan Flood Prevention Headquarters, providing a comparative explanation of the reasons for the great flood suffered by Wuhan in 1931 under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and the deployment of our current flood prevention work, as well as the conditions that guarantee our victory. In addition, articles on scientific knowledge, such as "Where Does the Yangtze River Flood Come From?" and "The Basic Situation of Wuhan Dike Projects," were published, providing scientific and popular explanations of the regularity of floods and other issues. In this way, it helped people understand that the destructiveness of floods can be controlled and restrained, thereby arming people ideologically and enhancing their confidence in "man will conquer nature."

    When the flood initially threatened Wuhan's national construction and the people's safety, the Changjiang Daily, based on the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China's policy of "taking flood prevention work as the overriding center during the flood season," determined that "flood prevention publicity is the overriding and pervasive central task." The newspaper promptly established a flood prevention reporting team, specifically responsible for reporting on the front lines of flood prevention work, and mobilized the entire editorial department to invest in this publicity battle for flood prevention. For more than two months, the Changjiang Daily, guided by a clear reporting ideology and implementing this ideology with combat actions, has achieved great success in mobilizing the masses to overcome the flood and providing timely and effective guidance to flood prevention work, giving full play to the role of the newspaper as an ideological weapon in the struggle against natural disasters.

    向洪水作斗争
    六月末以来，长江日报在武汉市人民与百年未有的洪水进行紧张斗争的过程中，展开了连续集中的防汛宣传。报纸发表了一系列的社论、短评和防汛工作宣传材料，向群众进行了比较深入的思想动员。它一方面提醒人们，洪水的威胁是极为严重的，决不容许我们疏忽大意和麻痹松懈；另一方面指出了在共产党和人民政府的领导下，在群众觉悟提高的基础上，我们也有战胜洪水的基本有利条件。报纸号召人们集中一切力量加速完成防汛工程，巩固已得成绩，争取最后决战的胜利，并对分散力量、延误时机、麻痹松懈的思想和作法作了严肃的批判。长江日报在这次宣传中极为重视言论工作，从各方面分析解释了党的方针和防汛工作的情况，这就能大大提高人们的认识，为巩固堤防战胜洪水树立了坚实的思想基础。
    在这次防汛斗争中，长江日报连续报道了全国人民支援当地的防汛工作，以及武汉人民修堤抢险、卫护堤防和洪水进行艰苦斗争，而又走在洪水前面的种种英勇事迹。一次报道中说：标着“北京”、“官厅水库”、“长江水利委员会”、“沈阳水泵厂”等字样的木箱不断地从卡车上卸下来，越来越多的抽水机运到了张公堤上，用来排掉堤内的渍水。更多的报道还反映了这样的事实：一个建筑工人在抢险中被大石头砸断了一根手指，仍一声不响地忍痛坚持工作。张公堤上一公里地段内的防浪芦排被冲坏了，成排的战士、工人便身上挂着柳枝手牵手地站到水里，挡住浪涛对堤身的冲撞，争取时间迅速修复了防浪设备。参加防汛的工人表示：困难多比不了我们窍门多，水位高没有我们的热情高，雨水大比不了我们的决心大。防汛前线的人们在修堤抢险，后方的人们就坚持生产、支援前线。报纸报道的这些事实，深刻地教育了广大人民认识到党的领导的英明坚强，认识到我国人民民主制度的优越，也认识到人民群众自己力量的伟大。这种认识已经而且还将继续产生战胜洪水的巨大物质力量。
    长江日报还针对群众中提出的有关防汛工作的一些问题，及时地作了解答。例如，报纸上发表了武汉市防汛总指挥部发言人的答记者问，对于一九三一年在国民党反动统治下武汉遭受大水灾的原因，和我们现在防汛工作的部署以及取得胜利的保证条件，作了对比的说明。此外，并发表了长江洪水是从那里来的、武汉堤防工程的基本情况等科学知识的文章，对洪水的规律性等问题，作了科学的通俗的说明。这样，就帮助人们了解到洪水的破坏性是可以加以控制和约束的，从而在思想上武装了人们，提高了人们“人定胜天”的信心。
    当洪水一开始威胁着武汉市的国家建设和人民安全的时候，长江日报根据中共武汉市委“在防汛期内以防汛工作为压倒一切的中心”的方针，确定了“防汛宣传为压倒一切贯穿一切的中心任务”。该报并及时地设立了防汛报道组，专门负责防汛工作第一线的报道任务，并动员全编辑部的力量投入了这场防汛的宣传战斗。两个多月来，长江日报由于有了明确的报道思想为指导，并且以战斗的行动贯彻了这个思想，因而在动员群众战胜洪水，及时有力地指导防汛工作方面，取得了很大的成绩，发挥了报纸在和自然灾害作斗争中的思想武器的作用。（毅人）
