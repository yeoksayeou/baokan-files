US Armed Aggression Against Taiwan is a Grave Crime Against International Law
Zhang Zhirang, Vice Chairman of the China Political Science and Law Association

    The American aggressor clique has always been hostile to the People's Republic of China. They have constantly attempted to carry out armed intervention and war threats against China from three fronts: Taiwan, Korea, and Indochina. Following the Korean armistice and the restoration of peace in Indochina, international tensions have gradually eased. The American aggressor clique is not reconciled to the failure of its aggressive policies, and is stepping up its exploitation of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and taking various measures to create new tensions, attempting to occupy Taiwan for a long time, expand armed intervention, and further launch a new war of aggression.

    Taiwan and the Penghu Islands have always been Chinese territory. As early as the 13th century, the Chinese government at the time established an agency to administer them. In the Qing Dynasty, the Taiwan Prefecture was established, under the jurisdiction of Fujian Province, and later it was changed to a province directly under the central government. In the later period of World War II, the Cairo Declaration clearly stipulated: "The purpose of the three allies... is that all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese, such as Manchuria, Taiwan, and the Penghu Islands, shall be restored to China." This provision was also reflected in the Potsdam Proclamation as one of the main terms of Japan's unconditional surrender. The Proclamation declared: "The terms in the Cairo Declaration shall be implemented and Japanese sovereignty shall be limited to Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku and such minor islands as we determine.” Article 1 of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender stipulated that Japan accepts "the provisions of the Potsdam Proclamation of July 26, 1945, jointly signed by the United States, China, and the United Kingdom and later acceded to by the Soviet Union.” After Japan surrendered, China accepted the surrender of the Japanese army in Taiwan and began to exercise sovereignty over Taiwan, and Taiwan has in fact been returned to China. Therefore, Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory both legally and factually.

    Former US President Truman, in his statement of June 27, 1950, announcing the use of the Navy to control Taiwan, falsely claimed: "The determination of the future status of Taiwan must await the restoration of security in the Pacific, a peace treaty with Japan, or consideration by the United Nations." Such a fallacy is not only completely inconsistent with the above-mentioned international documents and historical facts, but also completely contradicts the US government's own previous statements. Several months before announcing the use of the Navy to control Taiwan, Truman had already listed the above provisions and the fact that Taiwan had been returned to China in a statement on January 5, 1950, and claimed: "The United States and other Allied Powers recognize that China has the right to exercise authority over the island." The US State Department reiterated on February 9 of the same year: "Since 1945, Taiwan has been administered by China... It has been incorporated into China—becoming a province." Therefore, Taiwan not only belongs to China legally, but has also been returned to China in fact long ago. The US government's so-called "future status of Taiwan" issue only indicates that it knows that its occupation of Taiwan is illegal, and wants to quibble in the midst of the indefensible.

    Since Taiwan is Chinese territory, China should exercise sovereignty over Taiwan. Therefore, liberating Taiwan is entirely China's internal affair, and any interference by the US government is a criminal act of violating international law.

    The principle of sovereignty is a universally recognized basic principle of international law. Sovereignty is the state of a country's national power being independent of any other power, domestic or foreign. All acts that infringe upon a country's independence and autonomy are acts that infringe upon its national sovereignty, and are illegal acts. National territory is part of the earth under national sovereignty, including land, water, and air. It is the material manifestation of the supreme power, independence, and inviolability of the people who reside there. National territory is under the exclusive sovereignty of the country. No part of it allows the power activities of other countries. Therefore, if a country has any power activities within the territory of another country, it infringes upon the sovereignty of that country.

    The principle of sovereignty directly gives rise to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries in international law. All countries must respect the independence and sovereignty of other countries and not interfere in the affairs of other countries. Interfering in the affairs of other countries is infringing upon their independence and sovereignty. From the point of view of modern international law, it is a criminal act. Interference is not limited to the entry of troops. Invading the territory of another country with troops to carry out interference is open armed intervention. It is a more serious international crime that undermines international peace and security.

    The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is the remnant of the Chinese reactionary forces fleeing to Taiwan to make a final struggle. When this clique was still on the mainland, the US government used all its strength to help it launch and carry out the civil war against the people. After this clique fled to Taiwan, the US government further strengthened its political, military, and economic support and exploitation, so that it could occupy Taiwan, continue to struggle, and attempt to attack the Chinese mainland. This support and exploitation is already an act of interference in our internal affairs. The US government is not satisfied with this, and has become increasingly tyrannical, openly carrying out armed intervention and armed aggression against Taiwan.

    The US government's use of the Seventh Fleet to prevent our country from liberating Taiwan constitutes armed intervention in our internal affairs. It further invades Taiwan with its navy, turning Taiwan's important seaports into its naval bases, mooring warships in various seaports. Turning Taiwan into its "unsinkable aircraft carrier," establishing its air force bases, stationing military aircraft permanently, and establishing liaison radio stations and other facilities. Dispatching the navy and air force to demonstrate and provoke us. Supplying a large number of warships, airplanes, and various munitions to the Chiang bandits. Sending a large military delegation to be stationed permanently in Taiwan to reorganize, train, and expand the remnant troops of the Chiang bandits. Instructing the Chiang bandits and directly attacking and plundering ships of various countries that come to China for trade, expanding pirate activities, and blockading our coast. Using the Chiang bandits to carry out harassing and destructive wars against our mainland and coastal areas, and gradually expanding the direct actions of the US Navy and Air Force. At the same time, the US government is also negotiating a so-called "bilateral treaty on common security" with the Chiang bandits to establish a military alliance, attempting to expand armed intervention and war threats. These acts are even more armed aggression against our territory, Taiwan. The US government's acts of armed intervention and armed aggression against Taiwan constitute the most serious crime of aggression, which is armed destruction of our territorial integrity and infringement upon our sovereignty.

    The Soviet Union put forward the famous definition of aggression as early as after the First World War, at the 1933 Disarmament Conference of the League of Nations. Anyone who has one of the listed acts should be considered an aggressor, and the listed acts include armed forces invading the territory of another country, blockading the coast or estuary of another country from the sea, etc. At that time, this definition was adopted by the majority of the Security Committee composed of representatives from seventeen countries. It is the only widely recognized and used definition of aggression to date. In 1933, the Soviet Union concluded three conventions on the definition of aggression with eleven countries in London in accordance with this definition. US President Roosevelt also sent a letter to governments of various countries on May 16, 1933, suggesting the conclusion of non-aggression pacts, and also advocated stipulating in the pacts that the contracting parties "do not send any armed forces across their own borders." Well-known legal scholars in the bourgeois scientific community, such as Bella Karoyani and Corsentini, all started from the Soviet definition of aggression when studying the responsibility of states for international crimes. Karoyani wrote in 1934: "We can say that the London Convention (i.e., the above three conventions) laid the foundation for a new legal order, a necessary condition for any lasting peace." The prosecutors of the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal also used the Soviet definition in the trial of major war criminals. Even the Treaty of Rio de Janeiro signed by the United States and eighteen Latin American countries in 1947 stipulates that the invasion of armed forces into other countries is regarded as aggression.

    Even before the First World War, international law had already recognized that: a country's dispatching troops or warships into the territory of another country or simply passing through the territory of another country without permission is an infringement of the territorial sovereignty of that country. And infringing upon the territorial sovereignty of another country is a serious act.

    The Second World Peace Congress stated in its letter to the United Nations: "No political, strategic or economic considerations, no reasons concerning the domestic situation or domestic conflicts of a country, can be used as the basis for any country's armed interference in the internal affairs of another country. No matter what the excuse is, the criminal act committed by the country that first uses troops against another country is aggression." This is the simplest and clearest expression of the principle of armed intervention and crime of aggression.

    According to the above, the US government's intrusion of armed forces into Taiwan to prevent our country from liberating Taiwan is a serious crime of armed aggression carried out to interfere in our internal affairs, and it should be held responsible for all the consequences arising therefrom.

    In the past, the United States has always expressed strong opposition to any actions by other countries that involve the internal affairs of the United States. During the American Civil War between the North and the South, the British and French governments recognized the Confederate States of the South as belligerent parties, and the US government considered this to be an act that violated international law and harmed US sovereignty, and expressed great indignation. The United States has always regarded interfering in the internal affairs of Latin American countries as its exclusive right, and the United States will express strong opposition to any interference by other countries. Between 1862 and 1867, the government of Napoleon III illegally interfered in the Mexican Civil War and sent troops into Mexico. The United States demanded that France withdraw its troops and claimed that the actions of the French troops in Mexico were an infringement and armed interference of the "inalienable rights of the Mexican people". If the US government uses what it said at that time to measure the aggressive actions it is now taking against China, it should realize that this kind of behavior is absolutely intolerable to international law and human justice.

    The US government's aggression against Taiwan also completely undermined the Charter of the United Nations. Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the UN Charter affirms the principle of sovereign equality. Paragraph 4 of the same article stipulates: "All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any member state or state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations." Paragraph 7 of the same article affirms the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of any country. All actions of the US government in invading Taiwan completely undermined these provisions of the UN Charter.

    While committing the crime of infringing upon our country's sovereignty, the US government refuses to recognize the People's Republic of China and the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and shamelessly continues to recognize the Kuomintang reactionary remnant group occupying Taiwan, attempting to use this to facilitate the US government's aggressive actions and reduce the illegality of its actions. The US government's refusal to recognize our country is first of all using the recognition system as a tool for diplomatic interference, and it is itself an illegal act. Modern international law has always held that a country cannot arbitrarily refuse to recognize a new country or new government. Hall, the earliest authoritative international law scholar widely recognized by the modern bourgeois legal community, pointed out long ago: In theory, a politically organized society naturally enters the international family, as long as it has the characteristics of a country, it must be given lawful treatment immediately. (Hall: "International Law", English 8th edition, Section 26). Oppenheim, a later authoritative international law scholar recognized by them, also said: "The examples of various countries generally support the view that governments do not consider that they can arbitrarily, solely consider their own political interests regardless of legal principles, to decide whether to recognize or not recognize a new country." (Oppenheim: "International Law", Chinese version, Volume 1, Section 71-1) He also said: "The examples of most countries regarding the issue of government recognition are based on the above-mentioned 'principle of effective rule,' at least the examples of Britain and the United States are so." (Ibid., Section 73-3) The US government arbitrarily refuses to recognize the new country or new government established by the people, but uses it as a means of diplomatic interference, as mentioned above, this kind of behavior is illegal in itself. What's more, a country's intrusion of armed forces into the territory of another country, whether it recognizes that country or the government of that country or not, is always an act of aggression against that country. Therefore, the US government's attempt to reduce the illegality of its aggressive acts by implementing its proposition of refusing to recognize our country is only an attempt to reduce the illegality of other more serious criminal acts by implementing a criminal act.

    Since Taiwan is our country's territory, our country must liberate Taiwan. Any method that is incompatible with our country's sovereignty over Taiwan is a method that infringes upon our country's sovereignty, and it is a method that our country absolutely cannot tolerate. The so-called "trusteeship" of Taiwan by the United Nations means that our country will not exercise sovereignty over Taiwan. Countries and individuals who put forward this proposition not only violate the principle of sovereignty, but also want the United Nations itself to openly and directly undermine the UN Charter. Article 78 of the UN Charter clearly stipulates: "The trusteeship system shall not apply to territories that have become members of the United Nations." At the same time, this proposition also violates the explicit provision of Article 2, Paragraph 7 of the UN Charter that the United Nations shall not interfere in the internal affairs of any country. The so-called "neutralization" of Taiwan mainly means not allowing our country to liberate Taiwan. This method was proposed by Truman when he sent the Seventh Fleet to invade Taiwan. If any other country or individual truly does not hesitate to violate the UN Charter and advocates it, it is helping the US government to commit international crimes. Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai solemnly stated in his recent foreign affairs report: "China has no intention of invading the territory of other countries, and will never tolerate other countries invading China's territory. China has no intention of infringing upon the sovereignty of other countries, and will never tolerate other countries infringing upon China's sovereignty. China has no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, and will never tolerate other countries interfering in China's internal affairs. China will never threaten the security of other countries, nor will it tolerate other countries threatening China's security." This is the common will of our 600 million Chinese people. Taiwan is Chinese territory, and China must liberate Taiwan. Any interference by the US government is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people.

    美国武装侵略台湾是破坏国际法的严重罪行
    中国政治法律学会副主席　张志让
    美国侵略集团一向敌视中华人民共和国。他们曾经不断企图从台湾、朝鲜、印度支那三个战线上进行对中国的武装干涉和战争威胁。跟着朝鲜的停战和印度支那和平的恢复，国际紧张局势逐步趋于和缓。美国侵略集团不甘心于其侵略政策的失败，加紧利用蒋介石卖国集团，和采取各种措施，来制造新的紧张局势，企图长期侵占台湾，扩大武装干涉，并进而发动新的侵略战争。
    台湾、澎湖一向是中国的领土。它在十三世纪就由中国当时的政府设司管辖。在清朝，设台湾府，属福建省管，后改为行省，直属中央。在第二次世界大战后期，开罗宣言明白规定：“三国之宗旨，……在使日本所窃取于中国的领土，例如满洲、台湾、澎湖群岛等，归还中国”。这一条款又在波茨坦公告中表现为日本无条件投降的主要条款之一。公告宣称：“开罗宣言之条件必将实施，而日本之主权必将限于本州、北海道、九州、四国及吾人所决定其他小岛之内”。日本投降条款第一条规定日本接受“中美英三国共同签署的、后来又有苏联参加的一九四五年七月二十六日的波茨坦公告中的各条款。”在日本投降后，中国接受了台湾日军的投降，在台湾开始行使主权，台湾在事实上也已经归还了中国。所以台湾无论在法律上或事实上都是中国领土不可分割的一部分。
    美国前总统杜鲁门在一九五○年六月二十七日宣布以海军控制台湾的声明中，妄称：“台湾未来地位的决定，必须等待太平洋安全的恢复，对日和约的缔结，或联合国的考虑。”这种谬论不但与上述国际文件和历史事实完全不合，而且与美国政府自己的历次声明也完全矛盾。杜鲁门在宣布以海军控制台湾以前几个月，在一九五○年一月五日的声明中早已列举了上述各项条款和台湾已经归还中国的事实，并声称：“美国和其他盟国也承认中国得对该岛行使权力”。美国国务院在同年二月九日又申明：“自一九四五年起，台湾就已由中国管理。……它已包括在中国之内——成为一省”。所以台湾不仅在法律上属于中国，在事实上也早已归还了中国，美国政府提出所谓“台湾未来地位”问题，只表示它自知侵占台湾之为非法，而想在无可辩解之中进行狡辩。
    台湾既是中国的领土，中国就应在台湾行使主权。所以解放台湾完全是中国的内政，美国政府的任何干涉行为都是破坏国际法的犯罪行为。
    主权原则是公认的国际法的基本原则。主权就是一国的国家权力对国内国外任何其他权力都是独立的这种状态。一切侵犯国家独立自主的行为都是侵犯国家主权的行为，都是不法行为。国家领土是在国家主权下的地球的一部分，包括陆、水、空在内。它是定居在那里的人民的最高权、独立性和不可侵犯性的物质表现。国家领土是属于本国排他性的主权之下的。它的任何一部分都不容许有其他国家的权力活动。所以一个国家如在他国的领土内有任何权力活动，它就侵犯了那一国的主权。
    主权原则在国际法上直接产生出不干涉他国内政的原则。各国必须尊重他国的独立和主权，不干涉他国的事务。干涉他国的事务就是侵犯他国的独立和主权。它从现代国际法的观点来看，是犯罪行为。干涉并不限于军队入境。把军队侵入他国领土以进行干涉，是公开的武装干涉。它是破坏国际和平与安全的更严重的国际罪行。
    蒋介石卖国集团是逃在台湾以图最后挣扎的中国反动势力的残余。在这集团尚在大陆之时，美国政府即曾用一切力量来帮助它发动并进行反对人民的内战。在这集团逃到台湾之后，美国政府又在政治上、军事上、经济上加强对它的支持和利用，使它能盘据台湾，继续挣扎，并企图进攻中国大陆。这种支持和利用已经就是干涉我国内政的行为。美国政府还不以此为满足，竟越来越横暴，公然进行武装干涉和武装侵略台湾。
    美国政府使用第七舰队以阻止我国解放台湾，这就构成了对我国内政的武装干涉。它更把海军侵入台湾，把台湾重要海港变为它的海军基地，在各海港碇泊军舰。把台湾作为它的“不沉的航空母舰”，建立它的空军基地，常驻军用飞机，并建立联络电台等设备。出动海军、空军同我示威寻衅。把大批军舰、飞机和各种军火供给蒋匪。派庞大的军事代表团常驻台湾，改编、训练和扩充蒋匪残余部队。指使蒋匪并自行直接对来华通商的各国船舶实施攻击、掠夺，扩大海盗活动，封锁我国沿海。利用蒋匪对我国大陆和沿海进行骚扰性和破坏性的战争，并逐渐扩大美国海军、空军的直接行动。同时，美国政府还正在与蒋匪商订所谓“共同安全双边条约”，建立军事同盟，企图扩大武装干涉和战争威胁。这些行为更是武装侵略我国领土台湾。美国政府的武装干涉和武装侵略台湾的行为构成了武装破坏我国领土完整和侵犯我国主权的最严重的侵略罪行。
    苏联早在第一次世界大战之后，在一九三三年国际联盟裁减军备会议上就提出了著名的侵略定义。凡有列举行为之一者即应认为侵略国，列举的行为包括武装力量侵入他国领土，从海上封锁他国的海岸或海口等。当时这个定义被十七国代表所组成的安全委员会多数通过。它是迄今唯一被广泛公认和使用的侵略定义。苏联在一九三三年就按照这个定义，与十一个国家在伦敦先后订立了三个关于侵略定义的公约。美国前总统罗斯福在一九三三年五月十六日致函各国政府建议订立互不侵犯公约，也主张在公约中规定缔约国“不派遣任何武装力量越过自己的边境”。资产阶级科学界闻名的法学者，如贝拉·卡洛扬尼、柯森蒂尼等，在研究国家对国际罪行的责任时，都是从苏联的侵略定义出发的。卡洛扬尼在一九三四年写道：“我们可以说，伦敦公约（即上述三个公约）为新的法律秩序，为任何持久和平的必要条件奠定了基础。”纽伦堡国际军事法庭的检察官也在主要战犯的审判中使用了苏联的定义。就是一九四七年美国和十八个拉丁美洲国家所签订的里约热内卢条约也规定把武装力量侵入他国视为侵略。
    就在第一次世界大战以前，国际法也早已认为：一个国家未经允许而派遣军队、军舰进入他国领土或仅通过他国领土，就是对该国领土主权的侵犯。而侵犯他国的领土主权是一种严重的行为。
    第二届世界保卫和平大会致联合国书中提出：“任何政治、战略和经济上的考虑，任何关于某一国家的国内局势或国内冲突方面的理由，都不能作为任何国家武装干涉另一国家内政的根据。不论借口如何，对另一个国家首先使用军队的国家所作的罪恶行为，就是侵略。”这就是关于武装干涉和侵略罪行的原则的最简单明了的表述。
    依上所述，美国政府把武装力量侵入台湾，以阻止我国解放台湾，是为了干涉我国内政而进行的武装侵略的严重罪行，它应负因此产生的一切后果的责任。
    美国在过去历史上遇到其他国家有涉及美国内部事务的任何行为，必表示强烈的反对。在美国南北两方内战时期，英、法承认了南方联合诸州为交战方，美国政府就认为这是违反国际法，损害美国主权的行为，表示极大的愤恨。美国一向把干涉拉丁美洲各国的内政作为它专有的权利，其他国家如有干涉的行为，美国必表示强烈的反对。在一八六二年至一八六七年间拿破仑第三政府违法干涉墨西哥内战，把军队开入墨西哥。美国就要求法国撤退军队，并声称：法国军队在墨西哥的行动是对“墨西哥人民的不可转让的权利”的侵犯和武装干涉。美国政府如果把它那时所说的话来衡量一下它现在对中国所进行的侵略行为，就应该认识到这种行为是国际法和人类正义所绝对不能容许的。
    美国政府侵略台湾的行为也彻底破坏了联合国宪章。联合国宪章第二条第一项确定了主权平等的原则。同条第四项规定：“各会员国在其国际关系上不得使用威胁或武力，或以与联合国宗旨不符之任何其他方法，侵害任何会员国或国家之领土完整或政治独立”。同条第七项肯定了不干涉任何国家内政的原则。美国政府侵略台湾的一切行为彻底破坏了联合国宪章的这些规定。
    美国政府一面进行侵犯我国主权的罪行，一面拒绝承认中华人民共和国和中华人民共和国中央人民政府，无耻地继续承认盘据台湾的国民党反动残余集团，企图借以便利美国政府的侵略行为，并减轻其行为的违法性。美国政府拒绝承认我国的这种行为，首先就是利用承认制度作为外交干涉的工具，它本身就是一种违法行为。近代国际法自始就认为一个国家不能任意地拒绝承认一个新国家或新政府。现代资产阶级法学界一向公认的最早的权威国际法学家霍尔早就指出：在理论上，一个在政治上组织起来的社会，当然进入国际家庭，只要它一具有国家的特征，就必须立即予以依法的待遇。
  （霍尔：“国际法”，英文版第八版，第二六节）。他们公认的较后的一个权威国际法学家奥本海也说：“各国实例大体上支持一种见解，即各国政府并不认为它们可以专断地，单单考虑自己的政治利益而不顾法律原则，来决定对新国家承认或不承认”。（奥本海：“国际法”，中文版，第一卷，第七一目——一）他又说：“大部分国家关于政府承认问题的实例，都是以上述‘有效统治的原则’为根据，至少英、美两国的实例是如此的。”
  （同上，第七三目——三）美国政府对于人民所建立的新国家或新政府任意拒绝承认，无非是借以作为其外交干涉的手段，如上所述，这种行为本身就是违法的行为。何况一个国家把武装力量侵入另一国家的领土，无论它对那国家或那国家的政府承认与否，总是对那国家的侵略行为。所以美国政府企图以贯彻其拒绝承认我国的主张来减轻其侵略行为的违法性，只是企图以贯彻一种犯罪行为来减轻其他更严重的犯罪行为的违法性。
    台湾既是我国的领土，我国必须解放台湾。任何与我国对台湾的主权不相容的办法，都是侵犯我国主权的办法，都是我国绝对不能容许的办法。所谓把台湾交由联合国“托管”就是不由我国在台湾行使主权。提出这种主张的国家和个人，不仅违反主权原则，而且是要联合国自己公然进行直接破坏联合国宪章的行为。联合国宪章第七十八条明明规定：“凡领土已成为联合国之会员国者，不适用托管制度”。同时，这种主张也违背了联合国宪章第二条第七项联合国不得干涉任何国家内政的明文规定。所谓台湾“中立化”的办法，其主要的一面就是不让我国解放台湾。这种办法，是杜鲁门在派遣第七舰队侵入台湾时提出的。任何其他国家或个人，如果真不惜违反联合国宪章而予以主张，它就是帮助美国政府进行国际犯罪行为。周恩来总理兼外交部长在最近的外交报告中严正表明：“中国没有侵略别国领土的意图，也决不容忍别国侵略中国的领土。中国没有侵犯别国主权的意图，也决不容忍别国侵犯中国的主权。中国没有干涉别国内政的意图，也决不容忍别国干涉中国的内政。中国决不威胁别国的安全，也决不容忍别国威胁中国的安全”。这是我们中国六万万人民的共同意志。台湾是中国的领土，中国必须解放台湾，美国政府的任何干涉，都是中国人民所绝对不能容许的。
