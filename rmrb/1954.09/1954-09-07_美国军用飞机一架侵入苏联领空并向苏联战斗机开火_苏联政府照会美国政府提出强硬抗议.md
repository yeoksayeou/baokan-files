Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th. TASS, Moscow, September 5th: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister A. A. Gromyko received U.S. Ambassador Charles Bohlen on September 5th and handed him the following note.

	“The Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics deems it necessary to state to the Government of the United States of America as follows:

	According to accurately verified facts, a twin-engine ‘Neptune’ military aircraft bearing the insignia of the U.S. Air Force intruded into Soviet territory in the area of Cape Ostrovnoy, east of Nakhodka Port, at 19:12 Vladivostok time on September 4th of this year.

	When two Soviet fighter planes approached this intruding U.S. aircraft to inform it that it had entered Soviet territory and to request it to leave Soviet airspace immediately, the U.S. aircraft opened fire on the Soviet fighter planes. Faced with this situation, the two Soviet aircraft had no choice but to return fire, after which the U.S. aircraft fled towards the sea.

	The Soviet Government deems it necessary to draw the attention of the U.S. Government to the fact that this is not the first time that U.S. aircraft have intruded into Soviet territory.

	The Soviet Government lodges a strong protest with the U.S. Government against this further outrageous intrusion of a U.S. military aircraft into Soviet territory, firmly demands that those responsible for this intrusion be severely punished, and hopes that the U.S. Government will take immediate steps to prevent any further incidents of U.S. aircraft intruding into Soviet territory."

The U.S. Ambassador said that he would convey the Soviet Government's note to the U.S. Government.

    美国军用飞机一架侵入苏联领空并向苏联战斗机开火
    苏联政府照会美国政府提出强硬抗议
    【新华社六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科五日讯：苏联外交部副部长安·阿·葛罗米柯九月五日接见了美国大使查尔斯·波伦先生，交给他下列照会：
    “苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府认为有必要向美利坚合众国政府声明如下：
    根据业经精确地证实的事实，一架漆有美国空军徽号的双引擎‘海王星’式军用飞机，于本年九月四日海参崴时间十九点十二分侵入纳霍德卡港东面奥斯特洛夫诺伊角地区的苏联国境。
    当两架苏联战斗机接近这架入侵的美国飞机，以便通知它已进入苏联境内并请它立即离开苏联领空时，这架美国飞机竟向苏联战斗机开火。面对这种情况，这两架苏联飞机不得不开火还击，在此以后，这架美国飞机即向海面逃去。
    苏联政府认为有必要提请美国政府注意：美国飞机侵入苏联国境已不是第一次了。
    苏联政府就美国军用飞机又一次横暴地侵入苏联国境向美国政府提出强硬抗议，坚决要求严惩此次入侵的人员，并希望美国政府立即采取步骤，防止再发生美国飞机侵入苏联国境的事件。”
    美国大使说，他将把苏联政府的照会转达美国政府。
