Enterprises under the Steel Industry Administration of the Ministry of Heavy Industry

Completed the August Gross Output Value Plan

Enterprises under the Steel Industry Administration of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry completed 103.4 percent of the national gross output value plan in August, and overfulfilled the production plans for major products such as iron ore, metallurgical coke, and pig iron.

Some enterprises under the bureau were affected by floods. Thanks to the hard work of the employees in the tense flood prevention efforts, the normal operation of production was ensured. For example, the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant overfulfilled its production plan in August under the threat of the highest water level of the Yangtze River (exceeding the highest historical water level by 0.96 meters). In addition, many units created new production records in August. For example, after the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant improved the operation of the thin plate rolling mill, the output has increased more than twice compared to January. The small rolling mill of the plant also created a new record of rolling 32 mm round steel, which increased by 3.6% compared with the highest daily output in the past. The No. 2 open-hearth furnace of Tianjin Steel Plant created a new record of refining one furnace of steel in five hours and forty-one minutes, shortening the previous record by seven minutes.

    重工业部钢铁工业管理局所属企业
    完成八月份生产总值计划
    中央重工业部钢铁工业管理局所属企业，八月份完成国家生产总值计划的百分之一○三点四，铁矿石、冶金焦、生铁等主要产品超额完成了生产计划。
    该局一部分企业曾受到水患影响，由于职工们在紧张的防汛中坚持工作，保证了生产的正常进行。如马鞍山铁厂八月份在长江最高水位（超过历史上最高水位零点九六公尺）威胁下，仍然超额完成了生产计划。此外，在八月份又有不少单位创造了生产新纪录。如太原钢铁厂薄板轧钢机改进操作后，已较一月份提高产量两倍多。该厂小型轧钢机轧制三十二公厘元钢，也创造了比过去最高日产量提高百分之三点六的新纪录。天津钢厂二号平炉创造了五小时四十一分炼一炉钢的新纪录，较过去最高纪录缩短了七分钟。
