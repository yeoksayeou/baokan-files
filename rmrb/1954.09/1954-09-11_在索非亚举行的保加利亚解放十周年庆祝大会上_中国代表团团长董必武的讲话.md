Dear comrades, friends:

We, the government delegation of the People's Republic of China, entrusted by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, on behalf of the Chinese people, the Chinese government, and Chairman Mao Zedong himself, sincerely congratulate the Bulgarian people on the tenth anniversary of their liberation from fascist enslavement, and take this opportunity to extend our warm and fraternal greetings to you and the Bulgarian people!

Ten years ago today, the Bulgarian people, under the leadership of the glorious Bulgarian Communist Party and Comrade Dimitrov, the great leader of the Bulgarian people, and with the direct support of the victorious march of the heroic Soviet armed forces, held an armed uprising, overthrew the most vicious enemy of the Bulgarian people—the monarcho-fascist dictatorship, and transferred political power to the working people of town and country led by the working class. From then on, the Bulgarian people, who had undergone a long and heroic struggle and had a glorious history of long-standing culture, were forever freed from the oppression and exploitation of domestic and foreign reactionary ruling classes for hundreds of years, and embarked on the brilliant road of people's democracy and socialism.

The liberation of Bulgaria is a great victory for the Bulgarian working people and a great victory for the working people of the world. Today, the people of China, like the people of Bulgaria, are celebrating this historic and glorious festival with unparalleled excitement.

In the years since liberation, the diligent and brave Bulgarian people, under the leadership of their great leader Dimitrov and his loyal successor Comrade Chervenkov, and with the generous and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, have overcome numerous difficulties and victoriously completed a series of tasks such as eliminating the remnants of fascism, repelling bourgeois attacks, implementing social reforms, consolidating people's power, and restoring the national economy. On this basis, in 1949, they began a four-year first five-year plan to lay the foundation for socialism. At present, they are tirelessly struggling for the successful realization of the second five-year plan, for the rapid development of agriculture, the focused development of heavy industry, and the gradual expansion of light industry production, in order to further improve the material and cultural living standards of the working people.

Due to the rapid development of production, Bulgaria's economic landscape has undergone fundamental changes. Even during the first five-year plan period, industrial production had already gained dominance in the total value of the entire national economy, and socialist industrial components were already playing a leading role in the entire national economy; the transformation of agriculture based on cooperative principles also reached a decisive turning point, with the vast majority of peasants joining agricultural producers' cooperatives. People's Bulgaria has transformed from a historically backward agricultural country into an industrial-agricultural country.

As we celebrate the brilliant achievements of the Bulgarian people on the production front, we are naturally reminded that the "Lenin" National Metallurgical Factory built near Sofia produced its first furnace of steel last year, and a brand-new socialist industrial city—Dimitrovgrad—has risen on the wasteland next to the Maritsa River, boasting huge enterprises such as the Stalin Chemical Factory, the Chervenkov Thermal Power Plant, and the "Volcano" Cement Factory. We cannot help but look with admiration at the fact that in this country, about half of the main field work in agriculture has been mechanized, and there has been great development in electrical equipment in rural areas. New factories, mines, reservoirs, power stations, and many important buildings are springing up all over the country like bamboo shoots after rain. From the joyous voices of peaceful labor emanating from there, we hear the firm steps of the Bulgarian people advancing towards socialist victory.

Due to the rapid development of Bulgaria's economic construction, prices have been reduced for the fourth time this year, and residents across the country enjoy free medical treatment. A large number of working people live in newly built houses; people's culture is blooming like flowers, illiteracy among those under the age of fifty has been eliminated, and new worker-peasant intellectuals are growing rapidly. These facts fully demonstrate that the material and cultural living standards of the Bulgarian people are constantly improving.

The victorious progress of Bulgaria's economic construction and the continuous improvement of the people's happy lives prove the superiority of the people's democratic system. It has enabled the alliance of the working class and working peasants of Bulgaria to be increasingly consolidated and strengthened.

The Bulgarian people love peace. For ten years, they have consistently pursued a foreign policy of maintaining international peace, actively carried out friendly cooperation with the people of various countries, and have made significant achievements in striving to improve relations with their neighbors in the Balkan Peninsula.

The friendship between the Bulgarian people and the Soviet people has a long history. As early as seventy years ago, their ancestors forged a deep friendship in the common struggle against foreign invaders. Ten years ago, after the great Soviet army helped the Bulgarian people smash the shackles of fascism, the Bulgarian People's Army fought alongside the Soviet army, achieving the final victory for the Bulgarian people. The Bulgarian people and the Chinese people have received generous and selfless assistance from the great Soviet Union in their post-liberation construction endeavors. We, the people of both countries, cherish the fraternal friendship between us and our common friend—the great Soviet people—as we cherish the pupils of our own eyes.

The people of China and Bulgaria forged a brotherly friendship as early as during the arduous period of revolutionary struggle. The Chinese people had boundless sympathy for the Bulgarian people's anti-fascist struggle. The brilliant example set by Dimitrov, the outstanding activist of the international working-class movement and the great leader of the Bulgarian people, in the Leipzig trial for the revolutionary fighters of the international working class, left an indelible impression on the Chinese people. The Bulgarian people cared for and supported the Chinese revolution, and the liberation of Bulgaria further encouraged the Chinese people who were then engaged in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation. After winning liberation, the people of both countries showed brotherly concern for each other's construction achievements. The achievements of the Bulgarian people in socialist construction have inspired the labor enthusiasm of the Chinese people who are engaged in socialist construction and socialist transformation.

The establishment of the People's Republic of Bulgaria and the People's Republic of China has opened a new era for the eternal friendly cooperation between the people of China and Bulgaria. Bulgaria was the first people's democratic country after the Soviet Union to establish diplomatic relations with People's China. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, the friendly and cooperative relations between the people of the two countries have greatly developed. The cultural, trade, and other agreements and implementation plans signed by both sides have increased the trade volume between China and Bulgaria year by year, and cultural exchanges have been extensively carried out. In the past five years, there have been more than 40 various delegations and performing arts groups visiting each other. Now, Lieutenant General Dyakov and the Bulgarian People's Army Song and Dance Troupe are visiting China, and the troupe's outstanding art will surely be warmly welcomed by the Chinese people. I am deeply convinced that the ever-developing friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries in all aspects will be of great significance in promoting the socialist construction of both sides, realizing the common progress and economic boom, and strengthening the world peace forces headed by the Soviet Union.

Not long ago, the Geneva Conference reached an agreement on the peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue. The achievements of the Geneva Conference are the result of the efforts of peace-loving people from all countries in all aspects, and also a major victory for the world peace forces headed by the Soviet Union. The achievements of the Geneva Conference have led to a further relaxation of international tensions and have proven that international disputes can be resolved through peaceful consultation, and that countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully. The Chinese people are concerned about collective peace in Asia, and are also concerned about collective peace in Europe. In the future, the Chinese people will continue to fight alongside the peace-loving people of the world to defend world peace.

Comrades: As we solemnly commemorate the glorious tenth anniversary of Bulgaria's liberation here, please allow me once again, in the name of the Chinese people, to extend my warm congratulations and respect to the Bulgarian people, and wish you more and greater new victories in the great cause of further consolidating the people's democratic power, developing the national economy, creating your own happy and prosperous lives, building socialism, and safeguarding world peace!

Long live the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the people of China and Bulgaria!
Long live the People's Republic of Bulgaria!
Long live the unity of the world's peace and democratic forces headed by the Soviet Union!

    在索非亚举行的保加利亚解放十周年庆祝大会上
    中国代表团团长董必武的讲话亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
  我们，中华人民共和国政府代表团，受中华人民共和国中央人民政府的委托，代表中国人民、中国政府和毛泽东主席本人，衷心地祝贺保加利亚人民从法西斯奴役下获得解放的十周年，并借此机会，向你们和保加利亚全国人民，致以热烈的、兄弟般的敬礼！
    十年前的今天，保加利亚人民，在光荣的保加利亚共产党和保加利亚人民的伟大领袖季米特洛夫同志的领导下，在英雄的苏联武装部队胜利进军的直接支援下，举行武装起义，推翻了保加利亚人民最凶恶的敌人——保皇法西斯独裁统治，使政权转移到以工人阶级为领导的城乡劳动人民手中。从此，经过长期英勇斗争的和具有悠久文化的光荣历史传统的保加利亚人民，永远摆脱了几百年以来国内外反动统治阶级的压迫和剥削，走上了人民民主和社会主义的光辉大道。
    保加利亚的解放是保加利亚劳动人民的伟大胜利，也是全世界劳动人民的伟大胜利。今天，中国的人民，正同保加利亚人民一样，也以无比兴奋的心情欢庆着这一具有历史意义的辉煌节日。
    勤劳勇敢的保加利亚人民，在解放后的年代中，在自己的伟大领袖季米特洛夫和他的事业的忠实继承者契尔文科夫同志的领导下，在苏联慷慨无私的援助下，克服了重重困难，胜利地完成了肃清国内法西斯残余、打退资产阶级进攻、实行社会改革、巩固人民政权和恢复国民经济等一系列工作；并在这种基础上，于一九四九年开始以四年的时间完成了奠定社会主义基础的第一个五年计划。目前又正在为第二个五年计划的胜利实现，为迅速发展农业、有重点地发展重工业和逐步扩大轻工业生产，以进一步提高劳动人民的物质和文化生活水平而进行着不倦的斗争。
    由于生产的飞速发展，保加利亚的经济面貌已经获得根本改变。还在第一个五年计划时期，工业生产在整个国民经济生产总值中已占优势，社会主义工业成分在整个国民经济中已经起着主导作用；农业按照合作化原则进行的改造也达到了决定性的转折点，广大农民基本群众绝大多数加入了农业生产合作社。人民的保加利亚已由一个历史上落后的农业国变为工业—农业国家。
    当我们欢庆保加利亚人民在生产战线上获得辉煌成就的时候，很自然地就联想到在索非亚附近所建立的“列宁”国家冶金工厂去年炼出了第一炉钢，在马里查河旁的荒地上耸起了一座崭新的社会主义工业城市——季米特洛夫格拉德，那里拥有斯大林化学工厂、契尔文科夫电热厂和“火山”水泥工厂等巨大企业。我们也不能不以欣羡的目光注视到，在这个国家里，农业方面主要的田间工作已有一半左右机械化，在农村中电气设备有了很大发展。新的工厂、矿山、水库、发电站和许多重要建筑，正如雨后春笋，出现在全国各地。人们从那里发出的和平劳动的欢乐声中，听到保加利亚人民坚定地走向社会主义胜利的前进步伐。
    由于保加利亚经济建设的迅速发展，今年已第四次实施减低物价，全国居民享有公费医疗待遇，大批劳动人民住在新建的住宅里；人民的文化像鲜花一般地怒放，五十岁以下的文盲已经扫除，新的工农知识分子正在迅速成长。这些事实充分说明保加利亚人民的物质和文化生活水平获得不断提高。
    保加利亚经济建设的胜利进展和人民幸福生活的不断提高，证明人民民主制度的优越性。它使保加利亚工人阶级和劳动农民的联盟得到日益巩固和加强。
    保加利亚人民热爱和平。十年来，他们一贯奉行着维护国际和平的外交政策，积极开展同各国人民的友好合作，并在努力改善与巴尔干半岛各邻国间的关系中，取得了重大成就。
    保加利亚人民和苏联人民之间的友谊有着悠久的历史。还在七十多年以前，他们的先辈就在反对外国侵略者的共同斗争中，结成了深厚的友谊。十年前，在伟大苏联军队帮助保加利亚人民粉碎法西斯枷锁后，保加利亚人民军又和苏军并肩作战，取得了保加利亚人民的最后胜利。保加利亚人民和中国人民在解放后的建设事业中，从伟大的苏联得到慷慨无私的援助。我们两国人民像爱护自己的眼珠一样，无限珍贵和我们共同的朋友——伟大苏联人民之间的兄弟友谊。
    中保两国人民远在处于艰苦的革命斗争时期里，就结成了兄弟般的友谊。中国人民对于保加利亚人民的反法西斯斗争曾寄以无限的同情。国际工人阶级运动的杰出活动家、保加利亚人民的伟大领袖季米特洛夫在来比锡法庭为国际工人阶级的革命战士树立的光辉榜样，给予中国人民以不可磨灭的印象。保加利亚人民关怀和支持中国革命，而保加利亚的解放，更鼓舞了当时正在进行抗日战争和解放战争的中国人民。我们两国人民赢得解放之后，对彼此的建设成就都怀着兄弟般的关心。保加利亚人民在社会主义建设中的成就，鼓舞了正在从事社会主义建设和社会主义改造的中国人民的劳动热情。
    保加利亚人民共和国和中华人民共和国的成立，为中保两国人民永远的友好合作开辟了新的纪元。保加利亚是继苏联之后最先和人民中国建立邦交的人民民主国家。自建交以来，两国人民的友好合作关系有了很大发展。双方多次签订的文化、贸易等各种协定和执行计划，使中保两国贸易额逐年增长，文化交流广泛开展。五年来，仅双方来往的各种代表团和文工团即达四十多起，现在，迪亚科夫中将和保加利亚人民军歌舞团，正在中国进行访问，歌舞团杰出的艺术定会受到中国人民的热烈欢迎。我深信，我们两国之间在各方面日益发展着的友好合作关系，对推动双方的社会主义建设、实现共同进步和经济高涨的愿望，和加强以苏联为首的世界和平力量，具有重大意义。
    不久以前，日内瓦会议对和平解决印度支那问题达成了协议。日内瓦会议的成就是争取和平的各国人民从各方面努力的结果，也是以苏联为首的世界和平力量的一个重大胜利。日内瓦会议的成就导致了国际紧张局势的进一步缓和，并证明国际争端是可以用和平协商的办法求得解决的，各种不同社会制度的国家是可以和平共处的。中国人民关心亚洲的集体和平，同样也关心欧洲的集体和平。今后，中国人民将继续同全世界爱好和平的人民一道，为保卫世界和平而斗争。
    同志们：当我们在这里隆重地纪念保加利亚解放十周年这一光辉节日的时候，请允许我再一次以中国人民的名义向保加利亚人民致以热烈的祝贺和敬意，并预祝你们在进一步巩固人民民主政权、发展国民经济、创造自己的美好幸福生活、建设社会主义和维护世界和平的伟大事业中，获得更多、更大的新的胜利！
    中保两国人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊万岁！
    保加利亚人民共和国万岁！
    以苏联为首的世界和平民主力量团结万岁！
                        （新华社索非亚讯）
