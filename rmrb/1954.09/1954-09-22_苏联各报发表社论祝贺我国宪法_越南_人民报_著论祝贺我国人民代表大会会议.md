Soviet Newspapers Publish Editorials Congratulating Our Country's Constitution
Vietnamese "People's Daily" Publishes Article Congratulating Our National People's Congress Meeting
Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 21st: Moscow newspapers all published the news on the 21st that the First Session of the First National People's Congress of our country had adopted the Constitution of the People's Republic of China.

All three of the largest newspapers in the Soviet Union—"Pravda," "Izvestia," and "Trud"— devoted nearly two pages to publishing the full text of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China.

"Pravda," "Izvestia," and "Trud" all published editorials on this. "Pravda's" editorial was titled: "The Constitution of the People's Republic of China." "Izvestia's" editorial was titled: "A Major Milestone in the History of the Chinese People." "Trud's" editorial was titled: "A Document of Great Historical Significance."

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 21st: "Izvestia" published an editorial on the 21st, commenting on the adoption of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China by the First Session of the First National People’s Congress of the People's Republic of China.

The editorial pointed out: The Constitution passed in Beijing yesterday is the result of many years of heroic struggle by the Chinese people. In order to convene such a meeting and pass this Constitution which consolidates all the achievements gained by the heroic Chinese people under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people had to break free from the shackles of imperialism and feudalism, establish a people's state, implement fundamental democratic reforms in all aspects of life (including the great land reform), heal the wounds inflicted on industry and agriculture during many years of war, and put the national economy on the track of planned development.

The achievements of the People's China in peaceful construction and in the struggle for peace and security in Asia and the world have won the sympathy of hundreds of millions of people in various countries. This is evidenced by the recognition of the role of the People's Republic of China as a major power at the Geneva Conference, and the growing demand for the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's China in the United Nations. The People's Republic of China has become a very important factor in promoting peace in the Far East and the world.

The growing role of People's China in all international affairs, and its tireless struggle for peace and security of the people of Asian countries—all this is disliked by the enemies of peace, the imperialist aggressors. The American ruling clique supports the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, which occupies Taiwan, an inseparable part of Chinese territory, instigating them to carry out provocations against the People's Republic of China, and establishing aggressive military blocs in Asia directed against the freedom and independence of the Chinese people.

The Chinese people are encouraged by the adoption of the Constitution, and they are fully determined to vigilantly defend all their historical achievements and bravely safeguard these historical achievements. No force can take away from the great people the fruits they have obtained through bloody sacrifices and arduous struggles in cruel trials and battles.

Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, September 21st: The Vietnamese Labor Party's newspaper "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 21st, congratulating the convening of the First Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China.

The editorial said: In the past five years, the great People's Republic of China has carried out a series of important democratic reforms, and is currently leaping forward on the road to industrialization, and has made great contributions to safeguarding peace in Asia and the world.

The editorial continued: Now the Chinese people have carried out universal suffrage, and the First Session of the First National People's Congress of China has opened. Convening the National People's Congress to adopt the Constitution is a major event in the political life of the Chinese people.

The editorial pointed out: The People's Republic of China has set a goal for the people of Asian nations in their struggle against imperialist aggression, to establish independent countries and to establish their own new lives in the political, economic and cultural fields. The existence of the People's Republic of China and its new progress is a powerful and invincible force for safeguarding peace and security in Asian countries, and has a tremendous inspiring effect on the national liberation struggles of Asian countries.

The editorial said: Vietnam, China's neighbor, has learned rich experience in struggle from the Chinese people in a long-term armed struggle. Now that peace has been restored in Indochina, the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of President Ho, the Vietnamese Labor Party, and the Vietnamese government, and inspired by the Chinese people, are resolutely struggling to consolidate peace, move towards free elections to unify the country, and establish an independent, unified, and democratic country.

The editorial said: When the First Session of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China opens, the Vietnamese people congratulate the success of the Congress, and congratulate the People's Republic of China on leaping forward on the road of large-scale construction and achieving greater success in the struggle to safeguard peace in Asia and the world.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 21st: Newspapers in Bulgaria, Poland, and Czechoslovakia have widely published news about the First Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China.

Central-level newspapers in Bulgaria, such as "Rabotnichesko Delo" (Workers' Cause), "Otechestven Front" (Fatherland Front), "Zemedelsko Zname" (Agricultural Banner), "Trud" (Labor), and "Narodna Mladezh" (People's Youth), have been publishing news about the Congress every day since the 17th. "Rabotnichesko Delo" published a summary of Liu Shaoqi's "Report on the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China" on the 19th, as well as the congratulatory telegram from the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to the Congress.
