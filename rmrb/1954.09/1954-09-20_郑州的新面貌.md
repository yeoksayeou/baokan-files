    The intersection of the Beijing-Hankou Railway and the Longhai Railway—Zhengzhou is changing its face day by day.

    The fields in the western suburbs of Zhengzhou have become a beautiful new industrial zone. Here, you can hear the whirring of spinning machines and looms in the state-owned Zhengzhou No. 1 Cotton Mill. Bundles of cotton yarn and cloth have been loaded into railway cars and transported to various places. Here, you can see the light red staff dormitories and spacious factory buildings of the state-owned Zhengzhou No. 3 Cotton Mill. Construction of the Zhengzhou No. 3 Cotton Mill began in April this year, and now the internal engineering of its factory buildings is nearing completion and machines are about to be installed. After it starts production, it can produce millions of bolts of fine cloth and tens of thousands of bales of cotton yarn every year. The magnificent factory buildings of the state-owned Zhengzhou Oil and Chemical Plant, which started construction on May 1st this year, are also nearing completion. It will be fully put into production next spring, and it can produce more than 17 million catties of cottonseed oil a year.

    The expansion project of the state-owned Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory is underway. Many newly emerged high-rise buildings have changed the original appearance of the Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory. The newly built Zhengzhou Flour Mill can produce flour for 600,000 people after it is put into production. The surveying teams active in the suburbs of Zhengzhou are also working intensively to prepare for the construction of more new factories.

    The state-owned Zhengzhou Power Plant, which started generating electricity on October 24 last year, has increased Zhengzhou's power generation capacity many times over; however, due to the rapid development of industry, its capacity has become insufficient.

    With the emergence of many new factories, Zhengzhou's urban construction is also developing vigorously. A large-scale modern waterworks has begun construction. It is more than a hundred times larger than the original Zhengzhou Waterworks and will guarantee the water supply for Zhengzhou's industry and people's lives. In the early days of liberation, Zhengzhou only had one narrow cement road; now there are more than a dozen cement and asphalt roads. Last year, Zhengzhou did not have any buses, but now there are three bus lines. On the asphalt roads leading to the industrial zone, the buses that are running carry the joyful singing voices of young female workers from time to time. Four years ago, only a few street lights flickered with dim light on the streets of Zhengzhou; today a brilliant light illuminates the entire city. More than 34,000 meters of sewage works are also under active construction. Many stinky ditches have been filled in. A beautiful and clean Henan Workers' Sanatorium has been completed. This October 1st, industrial labor models from Henan Province will come here to recuperate. New theaters, cultural palaces, bookstores, ice factories, and food factories are constantly appearing in Zhengzhou. Seven million trees have been planted in the past on the banks of the Jinshui River, on both sides of the road, and in the sand dune areas, and more than 400,000 trees have been planted this year. In a few years, Zhengzhou will no longer be subject to wind and sand erosion. Zhengzhou, which used to be called "three feet of dust without wind, and streets full of mud in the rain," will become a modern and beautiful new industrial city.

    郑州的新面貌
    本报记者　陈迹
    京汉铁路和陇海铁路的交叉点——郑州一天天在改换着它的面貌。
    郑州的西郊的田野，已经变成一个美丽的新工业区。在这里，可以听到国营郑州第一棉纺厂的纺纱机和织布机转动的声音。一捆捆棉纱和细布已装进车厢，运往各地。在这里，可以看见国营郑州第三棉纺厂的淡红的职工宿舍和宽敞的大厂房。今年四月，郑州第三棉纺厂开始兴工，现在它的厂房内部工程快要竣工，即将安装机器。它开工生产后，每年可以生产几百万疋细布和几万件棉纱。今年五月一日动工的国营郑州油脂化学厂的壮丽的厂房也快要落成了，明年春天它要全部投入生产，一年可以生产一千七百多万斤棉籽油。
    国营郑州纺织机械厂的扩建工程正在进行中。许多新出现的高大的建筑物，已经改变了郑州纺织机械厂原来的面貌。新建的郑州面粉厂，在投入生产以后，可以制出供给六十万人食用的面粉。活跃在郑州郊外的测量队，也正在紧张地工作着，为更多新工厂的建设做准备工作。
      去年十月二十四日开始发电的国营郑州电厂，虽然已把郑州的发电量提高许多倍；但由于工业的迅速发展，它的能力已经显得不够充分。
    随着许多新的工厂的出现，郑州的城市建设也在蓬蓬勃勃地展开。一座大型的现代化的自来水厂，已开始修建。它比郑州原有水厂大一百多倍，将可保证郑州工业和人民生活的用水。解放初期，郑州只有一条狭窄的水泥马路；现在已有十多条水泥的和柏油的马路。去年郑州还没有公共汽车，目前已有三路公共汽车。在通往工业区的柏油马路上，奔驰着的公共汽车，不时地传出年轻的女工们欢笑的歌唱的声音。四年前，在郑州街道上，只有少数的路灯摇幌着暗淡的灯光；今天一片辉煌的灯光照亮着全城。三万四千多公尺的下水道工程，也在积极修建中。许多臭水沟都已填平。一幢美丽的清洁的河南工人疗养院，已经落成。今年十月一日河南省的工业劳动模范就要来到这里休养。在郑州，还不断地出现着新的戏院、文化宫、书店、制冰厂和食品工厂。在金水河岸，在道路两旁，在沙丘地带，过去已种植了七百万株树木，今年又种植了四十多万株。几年以后，郑州不再受风砂的侵袭。过去被人称做“无风三尺土，有雨满街泥”的郑州，将要变成一个现代的美丽的新工业城市。
