Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, September 19th: The delegation of the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army and the delegation of the General Command of the French Union Forces signed four new agreements in Phu Lo on September 15 concerning the establishment of a demilitarized zone and the transfer of troops.

    Regarding the issue of the demilitarized zone, both parties guarantee not to conduct hostile actions from the north or south of this area, and to avoid any attitudes or behaviors in navigation that could easily cause hostile situations.

    The agreement on the transfer of troops includes a resolution stipulating the principles for the transfer of the Vietnamese People's Army and the French Union Forces in Indochina, an appendix on the method of transferring Vietnamese People's Army troops using French Union Forces' shipping tools, and a plan to transfer the Vietnamese People's Army troops in Cua Viet and Ham Tan (South Vietnam) to North Vietnam.

    According to the above agreement, and in accordance with Article 15 of Chapter Two of the Armistice Agreement, the General Command of the French Union Forces agreed to transport Vietnamese People's Army troops, materials, and military equipment, some people and government cadres, recently released prisoners of war, and family members of Vietnamese People's Army soldiers from areas south of the 17th parallel to North Vietnam by sea. The agreement states: "The General Command of the French Union Forces is responsible for ensuring the realization of the transfer work it carries out and is responsible for the safety of the transfer."

    The 16,000 people and 1,200 tons of luggage currently concentrated in Cua Viet will depart from Cape St. James on the first batch of ships on September 20 and will land in岑山 (Cen Shan). According to the plan of the Vietnamese People's Army, the work of withdrawing troops from the Ham Tan and Cua Viet areas will be completed on October 4th or 5th, which is five or six days earlier than the deadline.

    One day after the conclusion of the above four new agreements—September 16—the delegation of the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army in Phu Lo sent an officer to South Vietnam to disseminate and implement the agreements.

    【新华社十九日讯】据越南通讯社北越十九日讯：越南人民军总司令部代表团和法兰西联邦部队总司令部代表团九月十五日在扶罗签订了有关建立非军事区和转移部队的四项新的协议。
    关于非军事区的问题，双方保证不从这个地区的北面或南面进行敌对行动，并且在航运方面避免一切容易引起敌对情势的态度或行为。
    关于转移部队的协议包括一个规定越南人民军和在印度支那的法兰西联邦部队转移原则的决议，一个关于用法兰西联邦部队的航运工具转移越南人民军部队的方法的附录，以及把川木和咸津（南越）的越南人民军部队转移到北越去的计划。
    根据上述协议，并且按照停战协定第二章第十五条，法兰西联邦部队总司令部同意把越南人民军部队、物资和军事装备，一些人民和政府干部，最近释放的战俘和越南人民军军人家属，经由海路自十七度线以南地区载运到北越去。协议说：“法兰西联邦部队总司令部负责使它进行的转移工作实现，并负责转移的安全。”
    现在集中在川木的一万六千人和一千二百吨重的行李将在九月二十日自圣杰姆斯角由第一批船载运出发，并将在岑山登陆。据越南人民军的计划，把部队撤出咸津和川木地区的工作，将在十月四日或五日完成，这就是说比限期早五天或六天。
    在缔结上述四个新协议后一天——九月十六日，在扶罗的越南人民军总司令部代表团派遣了一位军官到南越去传布和执行协议。
