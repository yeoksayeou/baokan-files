Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 14th: The full text of the Soviet Foreign Ministry statement is as follows:

	Recently, particularly due to the outcome of the Geneva Conference that led to the ceasefire in Indochina, and due to the failure of the plan to establish the so-called "European Defense Community," favorable conditions have been created to resolve outstanding international issues – including those in Asia. Now, the question naturally arises: how to utilize the current situation to further ease international tensions and to resolve outstanding issues in accordance with the interests of the people of Asia and the interests of consolidating peace in the East?

	It turns out that some are now taking steps not only in Europe but also in Asia, steps that have nothing in common with the interests of the people or the interests of consolidating peace. On the contrary, these steps are fueling international tensions and creating obstacles to resolving outstanding issues.

	As everyone knows, due to the initiation and pressure from the United States, activities to cobble together a new aggressive military bloc in Southeast Asia have been intensifying for months under the pretext of so-called “protection” of Southeast Asian countries against communism. This preparatory activity started even before the Geneva Conference, and the planners of this new bloc did not hide the fact that they wanted to present the Geneva Conference with a fait accompli, thereby conspiring to doom the Geneva Conference to failure in advance. It was for this reason that the United States put pressure on Britain, France, and other countries, attempting to accelerate the establishment of the aforementioned new military bloc.

	Everyone also knows that although some attempted to make the Geneva Conference fail or to interrupt it, the vast majority of conference participants, taking into account the increasingly strong calls from the people of various countries to end the war in Indochina, finally reached an agreement, thereby stopping the bloodshed in Indochina and creating conditions for a final resolution of the Indochina issue in accordance with the legitimate aspirations of the Indochinese people for national independence.

	The United States currently seems to hope to "remedy" the situation of the adherents of "policy of strength" after the failure of the "European Defense Community" treaty. With the support of Britain and France, it has taken new measures to cobble together a military bloc, this time in the Asia-Pacific region. This is manifested in the conference held in Manila from September 6th to 8th, which culminated in the signing of the so-called "Southeast Asia Defense Treaty." The planners of this "treaty" have incessantly boasted about it, touting it as a victory for the aforementioned "policy of strength."

	What does this treaty mean, and what purposes does it pursue? This can be illustrated by the fact that it was not Southeast Asian countries that planned to hold this conference. As everyone knows, this conference was planned and convened behind the backs of Asian countries by Western countries, with the United States playing a major role despite being more than 10,000 kilometers away from Southeast Asia. This fact convincingly shows whose interests this new bloc is being established for, and that all the arguments that this bloc is in line with the interests of Southeast Asian countries are worthless.

	As for the members of the conference, as everyone knows, besides the United States, there are also Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, the Philippines, and Pakistan. However, those organizers of the conference who insist that the task of this bloc is the "collective defense" of Southeast Asian countries were only able to bring in three countries from the region - Thailand, the Philippines, and Pakistan - whose hands and feet are already bound by the military and economic "aid" agreements they have signed with the United States. The other participants, apart from the United States, Britain, and France, are the two British dominions, Australia and New Zealand, whose political and economic dependence on colonial countries is well known.

	The vast majority of Southeast Asian countries have no difficulty seeing through the true intentions of the organizers of the Manila conference. Therefore, countries such as India, Indonesia, Burma, and Ceylon have refused to participate in the conference. Thus, the majority of Southeast Asian countries that some wanted to force into the aforementioned bloc, including countries like India and Indonesia with a total population of 440 million, have refused to participate. The population of the Southeast Asian countries that signed the Manila Treaty under the pressure of colonial countries is less than one-fifth of the entire population of Southeast Asia, and only about one-tenth of the entire population of Asia.

	These materials clearly illustrate the attitude of the Southeast Asian people towards the plan to establish a military bloc in the region forced upon them by external forces, and how much these plans violate their interests.

	In addition, the largest country in Asia, the People's Republic of China, with a population of 600 million, opposes this aggressive plan. It justly believes that the establishment of the aforementioned military bloc is a threat to its security.

	These facts alone expose the falsehood of the claim that the Manila conference and the treaty signed by the conference participants are for the "defense" of Southeast Asian countries and are in line with the interests of the people of Southeast Asia.

	The content of the treaty signed in Manila proves this point. The treaty content proves that this treaty is in fact pursuing aggressive purposes and is primarily and directly aimed at Asian countries.

	Article 4 of the treaty stipulates that if a certain "situation" occurs, the contracting parties shall consult with each other, and this "situation," as they have clearly and repeatedly stated, means any event that occurs in those countries that does not conform to the interests of the colonial powers and their military strategic intentions. The US government has taken and continues to take this attitude towards Indochina and the national liberation struggles of the Indochinese people. This has also been clarified by the reservation made by the US government when signing the treaty; in this reservation, it also attempts to obscure the issue by insisting that the measures stipulated in this treaty are aimed at dealing with some "communist aggression." The aggressive nature of this military alliance can also be proven by the following fact: the treaty stipulates that only those countries that "can promote the objectives of this treaty" can participate in this treaty. In other words, only the founders of the treaty can decide whether this country or that country meets this definition. This in fact means that the composition and nature of this alliance will be entirely determined by the United States. It is not difficult to see that all of this is directly related to the policy of Western countries to establish an aggressive military alliance in Europe with a remilitarized West Germany participating.

	Officials from the United States and other countries participating in the Manila Conference say that they intend to coordinate their efforts to prevent Southeast Asian countries from suffering "subversive activities." This is also mentioned in the treaty they signed. Anyone familiar with the facts and the real situation in that region can easily see the absurdity of this statement. "Subversive activities" is what they call the national liberation movements of the people of various countries in that region, their struggle for national independence and for liberation from centuries of colonial oppression. This precisely explains why Western countries, especially the United States, are constantly making efforts to establish a military organization in the Asia-Pacific region that can be used primarily to suppress the national liberation movements in Southeast Asian countries.

	Despite the fact that they always fabricate anti-communist slanders while making these attempts, attacking the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, this does not change the situation in any way. This is not a new method. The initiators of the so-called "Anti-Comintern Pact" used this method back then. Now - especially in the United States - the advocates of the "strength" policy use this method whenever this policy suffers a crushing defeat. Whenever they need to deceive public opinion and need to cover up the true purpose of establishing this or that aggressive alliance, they routinely use this method.

	The founders of the "Southeast Asia Defense Treaty" claim that the purpose of this treaty is also to promote the "economic development" of Southeast Asian countries. But this statement has nothing in common with the truth. This statement is as untrue as the claim that the establishment of this new military bloc is due to concern for the defense of Southeast Asian countries. In fact, the initiators of this treaty pay so much attention to the economic goals of this bloc not because they are concerned about the economic needs of the people of various countries in this region, but because they are planning for their own narrow, mainly strategic interests.

	As early as March 1954, US Secretary of State Dulles emphasized the strategic importance of Southeast Asia when he talked about it, and it is no coincidence that he emphasized that this region is rich in many raw materials, such as tin, oil, rubber, iron ore, etc. Therefore, Southeast Asian countries must become strategic raw material suppliers for the war industries of the United States and its North Atlantic Treaty Organization partners. They will continue to act as raw material countries subordinate to the economy of the colonial powers. This is the meaning of the "economic measures" stipulated as one of the tasks for the contracting parties.

	This new military alliance is in fact a group of colonial countries, and its foundation is the imperialist goal of maintaining the economic and political status of the colonial countries in Asia. The situation in Asia has undergone fundamental changes, especially due to the historic victory of the great Chinese people. The great Chinese people have ended foreign oppression, established a people's government across the country, and firmly embarked on the path of economic and cultural progress. We can say with great confidence that despite attempts to stop the national liberation movement that is steadily expanding in Asia, the people of Asian countries will move forward along the path of independent national development.

	Whether in Europe or Southeast Asia, only on the basis of the joint efforts of all countries in these regions, regardless of their social systems, and without foreign command and interference, can the security of Europe and the true security of the people of Southeast Asian countries be guaranteed. The cornerstone of the joint statement between the People's Republic of China and India on June 28, 1954, and the joint statement between the People's Republic of China and Burma on June 29 of the same year, is this principle, which is not only in line with the interests of the people of Asian countries but also in line with the interests of world peace.

	There is no doubt that only by creating a peaceful environment for the development of Asian people based on recognizing the independence and sovereignty of the Asian people can their economic and cultural development be made possible. On this point, people cannot but agree with the opinion of Indian Prime Minister Nehru, who recently said in the People's Assembly when talking about the importance of the ceasefire in Indochina that, due to the resolution of the Indochina issue, Asia has great hopes for obtaining peace and stability.

	The organizers of the new aggressive alliance are attempting to find ways to drag Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnam into this alliance. The protocol attached to the treaty openly states that the provisions in the treaty regarding military and economic measures can also be applied to Cambodia, Laos, and South Vietnam. Moreover, Article 4 of the treaty, which mentions military obligations, and Article 8 stipulate that the contracting parties can arbitrarily decide to include any territory within the treaty area. By including these provisions in the treaty, they clearly demonstrate that they apparently want to prevent the implementation of the Geneva agreements on Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam.

	However, it is not inappropriate to remind the drafters of the "Southeast Asia Defense Treaty" that the aforementioned attempts are incompatible with the obligations undertaken by the participating countries in the Geneva Conference regarding Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. These obligations and the statements made by the representatives of Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnam in Geneva preclude the possibility of them being dragged into any military alliance.

	The supporters of the "strength" policy declared in the preamble of the treaty that the treaty conforms to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. However, it is not difficult to see that this statement is untenable. In fact, the Manila Treaty, like the treaties establishing other narrow, aggressive military alliances such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is clearly contrary to the purposes and objectives of the United Nations. This time, the name and flag of the United Nations have once again been used to cover up actions that have nothing in common with the peaceful principles of the United Nations and the interests of maintaining peace, actions taken in preparation for another war.

	This is not the first time that attempts have been made to justify the establishment of a military alliance of countries with the claim of the interests of "defense" and the promotion of the "economic development" of the people of the countries dragged into this alliance. Such an attempt was made when the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was established, and such an attempt was made when the plan to establish the now bankrupt "European Defense Community" was drafted. Now the same attempt has been made again.

	It is worth noting that some countries participating in the Manila Conference have recently announced that they understand the national needs of the people of Asian countries and emphasized that they hope to normalize their relations with People's China. In this regard, it is not inappropriate to mention the statements made by the official representatives of Britain and France, especially during the Geneva Conference. One can very well ask: how can such statements be reconciled with the actions of Britain and France participating in an aggressive military bloc aimed at Asian countries in general and China in particular?

	The Soviet government can only regard the Manila Conference and the signing of the "Southeast Asia Defense Treaty" as actions against the interests of security in Asia and the Far East, and at the same time against the interests of the freedom and national independence of the people of Asian countries. The countries that initiated the establishment of the aforementioned new military bloc in Southeast Asia and the Pacific region must bear full responsibility for their actions that seriously violate the task of consolidating peace.

    就美国拼凑东南亚军事联盟
    苏联外交部发表声明
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十四日电：苏联外交部声明全文如下：
    最近期间，特别是由于导致印度支那停火的日内瓦会议的结果，以及由于建立所谓“欧洲防务集团”的计划失败的结果，形成了有助于解决悬而未决的国际问题——包括亚洲的问题——的有利条件。现在很自然产生了一个问题：如何利用当前局面来进一步缓和国际紧张局势，以及根据亚洲各国人民的利益和巩固东方和平的利益来解决悬而未决的问题。
    事实证明，现在有人不仅对欧洲、而且对亚洲采取着一些步骤，这些步骤无论是和人民的利益还是和巩固和平的利益都毫无共同之处，相反的，这些步骤促使国际局势更加紧张，并造成阻碍解决悬而未决的问题的障碍。
    大家知道，由于美国的发起和施加压力，好几个月来一直在所谓“保护”东南亚国家对付共产主义的借口下，加紧进行着在东南亚拼凑新的侵略性的军事集团活动。这一准备活动早在日内瓦会议之前就已开始了，当时这一新集团的策划者确实也没有掩饰这一点，即他们想要使日内瓦会议面对既成事实，从而事前就阴谋使日内瓦会议注定失败。正是为了这个缘故，美国才对英国、法国以及其他一些国家施加压力，企图加速建立上述新的军事集团。
    大家也都知道，虽然有人企图使日内瓦会议失败，或是使日内瓦会议中断，但是绝大多数会议参加者考虑到各国人民要求结束印度支那战争的呼声越来越强烈，而终于达成了协议，从而停止了印度支那的流血战争，并为根据印度支那人民要求民族独立的合法愿望来最后解决印度支那问题创造了条件。
    美国目前显然希望“补救一下”“欧洲防务集团”条约失败后“实力政策”的奉行者的处境，它在英国和法国的支持下，采取了新的措施来拼凑军事集团，这一次是在亚洲和太平洋区域。这表现为，从九月六日到八日在马尼拉举行了会议，会议最后签订了所谓“东南亚防务条约”，这个“条约”的策划者不停地吹嘘这个“条约”，把它说成是上述“实力政策”的胜利。
    这个条约意味着什么，它追求什么样的目的，可以拿这一事实来说明：策划举行这个会议的不是东南亚国家，大家知道，这个会议是西方国家背着亚洲国家策划和召集的，而在其中扮演主要角色的是距离东南亚一万多公里的美国。这一事实就充分令人信服地说明：这个新集团的建立是为了谁的利益，而硬把这个集团说成是符合东南亚国家的利益的各种论调值几文钱。
    至于说到会议的成员，大家知道，除了美国以外，还有英国、法国、澳大利亚、新西兰、泰国、菲律宾和巴基斯坦。然而那些硬把这个集团的任务说成是东南亚各国的“集体防务”的会议发起者能做到拉进来参加会议的只有这个区域中的三个国家——泰国、菲律宾和巴基斯坦，而这些国家的手脚都是已经被它们和美国签订的军事和经济“援助”协定所束缚住了的。其他的参加者，除了美国、英国和法国以外，就是两个英国的自治领澳大利亚和新西兰，这些国家在政治上和经济上从属于殖民国家是大家都很清楚的。
    绝大部分东南亚国家都不难看穿马尼拉会议组织者的真正目的。所以，像印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、锡兰这样一些国家都拒绝参加这个会议。这样，有人想硬把它们拉进上述集团的大多数东南亚国家，其中包括人口总数达四亿四千万的印度和印度尼西亚这样一些国家，都拒绝参加这个集团。在殖民国家的压力下，在马尼拉条约上签字的东南亚国家的人口还不到整个东南亚人口的五分之一，而只占全亚洲人口的十分之一左右。
    这些材料十分清楚地说明了，东南亚各国人民对于外力强迫他们接受的在这个地区建立军事集团的计划是抱着怎样的态度，这些计划是多么违背着他们的利益。
    此外，亚洲最大的国家、拥有六亿人口的中华人民共和国是反对这种侵略计划的。它公正地认为，上述军事集团的建立是对自己的安全的威胁。
    单是这些事实就揭露了这样一种说法的虚伪性：即有人说，马尼拉会议和会议参加者签订的条约是为了东南亚国家的“防务”，是符合东南亚各国人民的利益的。
    在马尼拉签订的条约的内容就说明了这一点。条约内容证明了这个条约实际上追求的是侵略目的，而且首先是直接针对亚洲国家。
    这个条约的第四条规定，如果发生某种“情势”，各缔约国须进行磋商，而这种“情势”，照它们明确地和一再地所说的，是意味着在那些国家中发生的凡是不符合殖民大国的利益和它们的军事战略企图的任何事态。美国政府对于印度支那和印度支那人民的民族解放斗争过去是采取这种态度，现在仍然是采取这种态度。这一点也已经由美国政府在签订条约时所作的保留上予以说明；在这个保留里，它还试图把问题模糊起来，硬说这个条约所规定的措施是旨在对付什么“共产党侵略”的。这个军事联盟的侵略性质也可以从下一事实中得到证明：这个条约规定，只有那些“能促进本条约的目标”的国家，才能参加这个条约。换句话说，只有条约的创始者才能决定这个国家或那个国家是否能合乎这个定义。这事实上意味着：这个联盟的组成成分以及它的性质将完全由美国一手决定。不难看出：所有这一切，是和西方国家要在一个重新军国主义化的西德参加之下在欧洲建立侵略性的军事联盟的政策有着直接的联系的。
    美国和参加马尼拉会议的其他国家的官方人士说，它们打算统一调度它们的防止东南亚国家遭受
  “颠覆活动”的努力。他们所签订的这个条约也提到这一点。凡是熟悉事实和那个地区真实情况的人，都很容易看出这种言论的荒唐。“颠覆活动”，他们就是这样来称呼那个地区各国人民的民族解放运动，他们争取民族独立、争取从数百年来殖民压迫下获得解放的斗争的。这一点正好说明了西方国家，特别是美国，为什么不断进行努力要在亚洲和太平洋地区建立一个能够首先用来镇压东南亚国家的民族解放运动的军事组织。
    尽管在作这种尝试的同时总是制造反共谰言，攻击苏联和中华人民共和国，这也没有使情况有什么两样。这并不是什么新的方法。所谓“反共产国际公约”的发起者当时就用过这种方法。现在——特别是在美国——“实力”政策鼓吹者每逢这个政策遭到惨败时便使用这个方法。不论何时，他们需要欺骗公众舆论，需要把建立这一个或那一个侵略联盟的真正目的掩盖起来时，他们照例就使用这个方法。
    “东南亚防务条约”创始者声称，这个条约的目的还在于促进东南亚国家的“经济发展”。但是这种说法和事实真相毫无共同之处。这种说法和所谓建立这个新军事集团是由于关心东南亚国家的防务的说法是同样的不真实。实际上，这个条约的发起者之所以十分注意这个集团的经济目的，不是因为他们关心这个区域的各国人民的经济需要，而是因为他们为他们自己的狭隘的、主要是战略上的利益打算。
    早在一九五四年三月，美国国务卿杜勒斯在谈论东南亚的战略重要性时便强调说，这个区域盛产许多原料，例如锡、石油、橡胶、铁砂等，这决不是偶然的。因此，东南亚国家必须成为美国及其北大西洋集团伙伴们的战争工业的战略原料供应者。它们将要继续充当附属于殖民大国的经济的原料国。给缔约国规定为任务之一的“经济措施”的意义就是如此。
    这个新的军事联盟事实上是一个殖民国家集团，而它的基础就是保持殖民国家在亚洲的经济和政治地位的帝国主义目的。亚洲的局势已经发生了根本的变化，特别是由于伟大的中国人民取得了历史性胜利。伟大的中国人民结束了外国的压迫，在全国建立了人民政权，并坚定地走上了经济和文化进步的道路。我们可以很有信心地说，尽管有人努力阻止正在亚洲稳步扩大的民族解放运动，亚洲各国人民将沿着独立的民族发展的道路前进。
    在欧洲和东南亚都是一样，只有在这些地区的所有国家不论社会制度如何，共同努力并且不受外来的指挥和干涉的基础上，才能保证欧洲的安全以及东南亚各国人民的真正安全。一九五四年六月二十八日中华人民共和国和印度的联合声明以及同年六月二十九日中华人民共和国和缅甸的联合声明的基石，就是这个不仅符合亚洲各国人民的利益而且也符合世界和平的利益的原则。
    毫无疑问，只有在承认亚洲人民的独立和主权的基础上创立亚洲人民发展的和平环境，才能为他们的经济和文化发展提供可能。关于这一点，人们不能不同意印度总理尼赫鲁的意见，尼赫鲁最近在人民院谈到印度支那停火的重要性时说，由于印度支那的解决，亚洲有了获得和平和稳定的巨大希望。
  新的侵略联盟的组织者正企图设法通过这一或那一途径把老挝、柬埔寨和越南南部拖到这个联盟中去。条约所附的议定书公开说，条约中关于军事和经济措施的条款也可适用于柬埔寨、老挝和越南南部。而且，条约中提到军事义务的第四条以及第八条规定，缔约国可以自己任意决定把任何领土包括在条约区域内。他们把这些规定列入条约中，就明确地证明他们显然想阻止实施关于老挝、柬埔寨和越南的日内瓦协议。
    但是，这样提醒一下“东南亚防务条约”的起草者不是不相宜的：上述尝试同日内瓦会议与会国在关于越南、老挝和柬埔寨方面承担的义务是不相容的。这些义务和老挝、柬埔寨及越南南部代表在日内瓦发表的声明，杜绝了它们被拖入任何军事联盟的可能性。
      “实力”政策的支持者在条约序言里宣称，条约符合联合国宪章的宗旨和原则。但是，不难看出，这种说法是站不住脚的。事实上，马尼拉条约正如建立像北大西洋公约那样的其他狭隘的、侵略性的军事联盟的条约一样，是显然同联合国的宗旨和目的背道而驰的。在这一次，联合国的名字和这个组织的旗帜又被用来掩饰同联合国的和平原则和维持和平的利益毫无共同之处的行动，为了准备另
  一次战争而采取的行动。
    这已不是第一次企图以“防务”的利益和促进被拖入这种联盟的国家的人民的“经济发展”的说法来为建立国家军事联盟辩解了。当初北大西洋集团建立的时候，曾经作过这种尝试，当初拟订建立如今已告破产的“欧洲防务集团”的计划的时候，曾经作过这种尝试。现在这次又作了同样的尝试。
    值得注意的是，参加马尼拉会议的某些国家最近还宣布过它们了解亚洲各国人民的民族需要，并且强调它们希望使得它们同人民中国的关系正常化。在这方面，提一下英国还有法国的正式代表所各自发表的声明，特别是在日内瓦会议期间发表的声明，不是不相宜的。人们很可以问问：这种声明怎么能够同英国和法国参加一个针对一般亚洲国家特别是针对中国的侵略性军事集团的行动相协调呢。
    苏联政府只能认为马尼拉会议和“东南亚防务条约”的签订是反对亚洲和远东安全的利益，同时反对亚洲各国人民的自由和民族独立的利益的行动。发起在东南亚和太平洋地区建立上述新军事集团的国家须对它们严重违反巩固和平的任务的行动负完全责任。
