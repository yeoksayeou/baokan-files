    Since the reorganization of departments and faculties in most universities across the country in 1952, teaching plans have been drafted with reference to the Soviet teaching plans, and these plans have been implemented. This is a great step forward for the old higher education system, which previously had no teaching plans at all. Over the past year, various schools have revised their teaching plans several times during the teaching process, and many schools have drafted teaching outlines for most courses. This has played a significant role in promoting the reform of higher education. However, these teaching plans still have many shortcomings. First of all, they generally lack clear training objectives. Secondly, the purpose of each type of course is not clearly defined. There is a lack of understanding or familiarity with the actual meaning and application methods of various teaching methods in each course. As a result, the allocation of teaching hours is largely arbitrary. For example, classroom discussions, experiments, internships, course design, and graduation design are often arbitrarily changed during implementation due to insufficient explanation. In particular, many initial teaching plans for specific majors simply copied and compressed the Soviet five-year teaching plans for use in our four-year schools. This has resulted in an excessive burden on students and a large amount of absorption without digestion, which not only harms students' health and increases the distress of teachers and students, but also seriously affects the quality of teaching.

    The Ministry of Higher Education of the Central Government was not clearly aware of the above-mentioned shortcomings and problems of the teaching plans for various majors, either during the National Conference of Higher Industrial Schools last year or during the First National Conference of Comprehensive Universities. It was only due to the active suggestions of Soviet experts that the Ministry of Higher Education gradually recognized the superiority and necessity of formulating a unified teaching plan, and then resolved to formulate a unified teaching plan. After nearly ten months of work, especially in the past six months, the unified teaching plans for most majors in the four-year undergraduate and two-year specialized programs of higher industrial schools have been approved and issued. The unified teaching plans for all or most majors in comprehensive universities, colleges of political science and law, colleges of finance and economics, higher agricultural and forestry colleges, and higher medical colleges have also been approved and issued recently, or will be approved and issued soon. This will play a significant role in further implementing the reform of higher education and further integrating higher education into the track of national construction plans.

    Why is it necessary to formulate and implement a unified teaching plan?

    First, the task of higher education is to train a sufficient number of high-level construction talents with a certain quality for the country. To accomplish this task well, it is not only necessary to have a comprehensive plan, but also to have unified standards, because our cadres are trained in different schools. Without a unified teaching plan, it is impossible to imagine having unified standards.

    Second, with a unified teaching plan, it is possible to formulate unified teaching outlines, unified experiment and internship outlines, and unified standard equipment plans for laboratories. Schools can also continuously accumulate teachers' experiences in the same areas and widely exchange these experiences in the implementation of the unified teaching plan, in order to continuously improve the quality of teaching. Only in this way can the visual teaching materials produced by various schools be exchanged and utilized. A unified teaching plan also greatly facilitates students' production internships, because students of the same major should have the same production knowledge.

    Third, at present, the teaching staff and equipment conditions of various schools vary greatly. If we do not provide a unified teaching plan as a common goal to be achieved by all schools and continue to allow each school to formulate its own teaching plan according to its existing conditions, it is easy for these schools to be satisfied with the status quo, which will hinder their progress.

    The new unified teaching plan has many characteristics: First, each major has a relatively clear training objective and scope of business. Second, in the arrangement of courses and the allocation of course hours, it maintains a scientific systematicness and an organic connection between courses, so that each course in the teaching plan has its own purpose and requirements, but all serve the unified training objective of the major. Third, it implements the principle of combining theory with practice and gradually cultivating students' ability to think independently. For example, the number of weekly class hours in the lower grades is higher, and the number of weekly class hours in the higher grades is lower; the proportion of lecture and theoretical teaching hours in the total number of school hours in the lower grades is also higher, and the proportion in the higher grades is lower; and the proportion of experiments, internships, course design and graduation design is appropriately strengthened. Fourth, the course hours and the allocation of various teaching method hours in the academic qualifications and teaching progress tables of similar majors or even similar majors are unified as much as possible under the condition of ensuring quality, thus greatly facilitating the teaching organization work of the school.

    Particularly important is that the new teaching plan effectively implements the principle of "combining the advanced experience of the Soviet Union with China's actual conditions." Since New China was founded not long ago, the political and ideological level of students is generally still relatively low. Therefore, the new teaching plan especially increases the proportion of Marxism-Leninism courses, not only in the proportion of other types of courses, but also in the actual teaching hours, exceeding the Soviet five-year teaching plan. The foreign language level of Chinese middle school students is also very low, and some have not even learned Russian. In order to provide college students with the necessary written tools to directly study the Soviet Union, the percentage of Russian language hours and the actual teaching hours in the new teaching plan also exceed the foreign language courses in the Soviet five-year teaching plan. In terms of streamlining course content, in order to ensure that professional construction talents meeting certain standards can be trained within four years, the courses that are more closely related to the professional training objectives (including basic courses and professional courses) are reduced less, or not reduced at all, and the courses that are less related are reduced more, or merged with other courses, or even cancelled. In terms of the setting of majors and specializations, according to the needs and characteristics of China's economic construction, the teaching plans for some majors we have formulated are also different from the Soviet teaching plans in many places. All of these show that the new unified teaching plan is not a mechanical application of the Soviet teaching plan, but is formulated in combination with China's actual needs and possible conditions.

    However, it should also be pointed out that these new unified teaching plans are not, and cannot be, perfect. It was originally a very complex and arduous task to formulate China's four-year teaching plan based on the Soviet five-year teaching plan, especially because these teaching plans were formulated under the condition that our understanding of the entire content and essence of the Soviet teaching plan was not deep enough. In the future, some or minor shortcomings and problems will inevitably be discovered during the implementation process. Therefore, after a period of practice, it will be necessary to make necessary revisions to these teaching plans. But this does not mean that these unified teaching plans can be changed frequently, because only after a certain period of practice can the shortcomings and problems of these teaching plans be discovered and confirmed. Therefore, before the unified teaching plan is officially approved for revision by the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central Government, all schools must fully implement it and cannot arbitrarily modify it.

    The teaching plan is the fundamental basis for the school to carry out teaching work. The ultimate goal of all work in the school is to implement and realize all the items and contents stipulated in the teaching plan and train high-level construction talents who meet certain standards. However, having a unified teaching plan is only the beginning of the work; if there is a unified teaching plan but there is no unified teaching outline for each course stipulated in the teaching plan and corresponding teaching materials, then there is no guarantee for the implementation of the teaching plan; if the teacher's lectures are not based on the unified teaching outline, but based on his own interests and subjective opinions, and he lectures on whatever he wants to lecture on and how much he wants to lecture on, then it is impossible to guarantee the training of high-level construction talents who meet certain standards. Therefore, after the unified teaching plan is formulated, it is necessary to closely follow the unified teaching plan to formulate a unified teaching outline for each course and to plan and write corresponding teaching materials. This is a more in-depth, more arduous and more meticulous work, which should be completed step by step but must be completed in a timely manner.

    The Ministry of Higher Education of the Central Government stipulates that the unified teaching plan shall generally be implemented from the new student classes in the 1954-1955 academic year. For the classes enrolled before, a transitional teaching plan must be formulated according to the unified teaching plan and the specific conditions of each grade in each school. In this way, on the one hand, it is to ensure that these students can have a higher quality as much as possible, and on the other hand, it can enable the school to actively create conditions and accumulate experience in the implementation of the transitional teaching plan, so as to lay the necessary foundation for the gradual implementation of the unified teaching plan for the new student classes in the 1954-1955 academic year.

    The implementation of a unified teaching plan will inevitably encounter many difficulties. First, there is the difficulty in terms of teaching staff. Each course stipulated in the teaching plan must be equipped with the necessary teachers, especially for professional courses or specialized courses that teachers cannot yet master, it is necessary to spend a certain amount of time to prepare, and there should be dedicated people to prepare. Second, there is the difficulty in terms of equipment. The experiments stipulated in the teaching plan should be opened on time, so it is necessary to build new laboratories or supplement existing laboratories. Third, there is the difficulty in terms of teaching materials and information. Because teachers do not know or know very little about the content of some professional courses, because colleges and universities have never conducted course design and graduation design in the past, many teachers have to learn from scratch, and there is also a lack of accumulation of information in this area. Therefore, timely translating Soviet teaching materials and obtaining reference materials related to course design and graduation design and information related to factories and mines are of particular importance to teachers.

    However, these difficulties are difficulties in the development of work, which should and can be overcome by various schools. All schools must, in the spirit of streamlining, saving and tapping potential, make full use of all possible conditions in their own schools and other schools, and formulate plans for training and equipping teachers, as well as plans for building new laboratories and supplementing existing laboratories, in accordance with the needs of the teaching plan and the regulations on the workload of teachers. As for the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central Government, it should make overall considerations and plans based on the needs of the whole country. In addition, attention must be paid to obtaining the help of relevant business departments and production units when solving the above-mentioned difficulties, such as sending teachers to factories for further study, striving for business departments to send people to schools to teach or teach concurrently, borrowing equipment from nearby production units to carry out experiments that are difficult to carry out for a while, and obtaining the necessary information for carrying out course design and graduation design. The relevant business departments and production units should also regard helping universities solve difficulties as part of their own work and give necessary and possible support as much as possible.

    In the implementation of the unified teaching plan, the main difficulties that need to be overcome are some ideological obstacles that will inevitably be encountered. It should be seen that in the process of actively learning from the Soviet Union to carry out teaching reform and repeatedly revising the teaching plan in the past two years, the administrative leaders and teachers have had a relatively deep understanding of why it is necessary to formulate and implement a unified teaching plan and the seriousness of the unified teaching plan, which is an important guarantee for the smooth implementation of the unified teaching plan. However, there are still many people who may be accustomed to the old and old ways and are unwilling to teach according to the requirements of the teaching plan, and are unwilling to actively learn and master various advanced teaching methods; there will also be people who lack the spirit of actively creating conditions to overcome difficulties and require the school to be given a certain "flexibility" in the implementation of the unified teaching plan; some teachers, when teaching, often overemphasize the importance of the courses they teach and inappropriately increase the teaching load, thus causing course centrism.

    The arrangement of various courses and various teaching methods in the new unified teaching plan is based on the law of student learning that should develop from shallow to deep and gradually, gradually cultivating students' ability to think independently, and implementing the principle of combining theory with practice. If anyone arbitrarily changes the order of the courses or arbitrarily changes the allocation of lecture, problem-solving, Q&A, experiment, and other hours, it will destroy the unified teaching plan. This is not allowed.

    The implementation of a unified teaching plan does not allow any colleges or universities or any teaching and research group to have the "flexibility" to arbitrarily modify it. Because no matter what the actual reasons of the school or teaching and research group are, if they are allowed to make even small modifications to the unified teaching plan on their own, the impact will inevitably destroy the unified teaching plan and turn into each doing its own way again. In this way, it will not only be impossible to guarantee the unified training objectives, but also impossible to guarantee the training of high-level construction talents who meet certain standards. In order to enable everyone to recognize the necessity of strictly implementing the unified teaching plan, the administrative leaders of the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central Government and relevant departments and schools must strictly guarantee teaching time. It is necessary to ensure that the school can start classes on time; excessive absences should be made up, and we must pay attention to reducing excessive social activity time. On the other hand, the difficulties that actually exist in some schools in the implementation of the unified teaching plan should still be taken into account. If, after careful study by the school leaders, it is considered that it is indeed difficult to fully implement the unified teaching plan and some temporary changes have to be made, then as long as it is approved by the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central Government, certain temporary measures can still be taken; but the school must also actively create conditions at the same time and strive to fully implement the unified teaching plan in the shortest possible time. The simple ideas and rigid practices of hoping to achieve success in one fell swoop without regard to actual conditions and specific steps are also wrong and must be prevented.

    The entire teaching plan is an organic whole. The courses stipulated in the teaching plan are all interconnected and mutually coordinated, and they are all courses that teachers must teach well and students must learn well. In this sense, there is no difference between major and minor courses in the teaching plan, or which one must be learned well and which one can be perfunctory. It is just like the five sense organs and limbs of a person are indispensable. If some teaching and research groups and some teachers, regardless of the whole, subjectively try to give students as much knowledge as possible, regardless of whether students can accept it, regardless of the role and purpose of this course in the entire teaching plan, the result will inevitably cause students to bear an excessive burden, and ultimately affect the smooth implementation of the teaching plan and affect the quality of the cadres trained.

    Therefore, in order to smoothly implement the unified teaching plan, it is entirely necessary for all schools to conduct a wide and in-depth study and discussion on the unified teaching plan and the difficulties and problems that need to be overcome in the implementation of the unified teaching plan. All schools should also formulate a work plan for implementing the unified teaching plan on the basis of this wide and in-depth study and discussion.

    坚决执行统一的教学计划，保证为国家培养高级建设人才
    中央人民政府高等教育部工业教育司司长　唐守愚
    全国大部分高等学校，自一九五二年院系调整后，就开始参照苏联的教学计划拟订了教学计划，并执行了这些教学计划。这对于过去根本没有教学计划的旧高等教育来说是一个很大的进步。一年多来，各校在教学过程中，又对教学计划进行了多次修订，很多学校并拟订了大部分课程的教学大纲，这对于推进高等学校的教学改革，起了很大作用。但是这些教学计划的缺点也还是很多的。首先是一般都缺乏明确的培养目标。其次是对于各类课程的目的性规定得不够清楚，不了解或不熟悉每门课程各种教学方式的实际意义和运用方法，因而在教学时数的安排上带有很大的盲目性，如对于课堂讨论、实验、实习、课程设计、毕业设计等，由于说明不够，在执行时也往往随意变动；特别是初期制定的很多专业的教学计划，都是把苏联的五年制教学计划用简单的压缩办法照抄照搬到我们的四年制学校来应用的，这样就造成学生负担过重和大量吸收而不能消化的现象，既损害了学生的健康，增加了教师和学生的苦恼，又严重影响了教学质量。
    中央高等教育部对于各专业教学计划上述的这些缺点和问题，不论是在去年全国高等工业学校行政会议的时候，或者第一次全国综合大学会议的时候，都还认识得不明确。只是由于苏联专家的积极建议，中央高等教育部才逐渐认识了制定统一的教学计划的优越性和必要性，并从而下定决心来制定统一的教学计划。经过将近十个月的工作，特别是最近半年来的努力，止于目前，高等工业学校四年制本科和二年制专修科绝大部分专业的统一教学计划已批准下达；综合大学、政法学院、财经学院、高等农林院校、高等医学院校全部或大部分专业的统一教学计划，最近亦已陆续批准下达，或不久便可以批准下达。这对于高等学校教学改革的进一步贯彻，对于将高等教育进一步纳入国家建设计划的轨道，都将起着重大的作用。
    为什么必须制定和执行统一的教学计划呢？
    第一、高等教育的任务是为国家培养足够数量和具有一定质量的高级建设人才。要很好地完成这一任务，不仅需要有统盘的计划，而且必须有统一的标准，因为我们的干部是在不同的学校培养出来的，如果没有统一的教学计划，就不可能设想有统一的标准。
    第二、有了统一的教学计划，才有可能制定统一的教学大纲，统一的实验、实习提纲和实验室的统一的标准设备方案。各校也才有可能在执行统一的教学计划中，不断积累教师们的同一方面的经验，并广泛地交流这些经验，以求不断提高教学质量。也只有这样，各校所制作的直观教材，才有可能互相交流和利用。统一的教学计划对于学生进行生产实习也有很大方便，因为同一专业的学生所应具有的生产知识应该是一样的。
    第三、目前各校的师资和设备情况差别很大，如果不给各校规定统一的教学计划做为共同要达到的目标，继续放任各自根据自己的现有条件制定自己的教学计划，很容易使这些学校满于现状，这就会阻碍这些学校的进步。
    新的统一的教学计划，是有许多特点的：第一、各个专业都具有比较明确的培养目标和业务范围。第二、在课程的排列及课程时数的安排上，保持了科学的系统性和各课程之间的有机联系，使教学计划中的每门课程都有自己的目的和要求，但又都服务于专业的统一的培养目标。第三、贯彻了理论与实际结合和逐渐培养学生的独立思考能力的原则。如，低年级上课的周学时数较多，高年级较少；低年级讲课及理论教学时数在学年总学时数中所占比重也较多，高年级较少；并适当加强了实验、实习、课程设计及毕业设计的分量。第四、同类专业甚至相近的专业的学历和教学进程表中课程时数和各种教学方式时数分配，在保证质量的条件下，凡是可能统一的都尽量统一了，因而大大便利了学校的教学组织工作。
    特别重要的是：新的教学计划切实地贯彻了“学习苏联先进经验与中国实际情况相结合”的方针。由于新中国建国不久，学生的政治思想水平一般还比较低，因此新的教学计划特别加重了马克思列宁主义课程的分量，不仅在与其他类课程的比重上，而且在实际的教学时数上，都超过了苏联五年制的教学计划。我国中学生外文程度也很低，有的根本没学过俄文，为了给高等学校学生以直接学习苏联的必要的文字工具，新的教学计划中俄文时数所占百分比和实际教学时数，也都超过了苏联五年制教学计划中的外文课。在课程内容的精简方面，为了保证能够在四年之内培养出合乎一定标准的专业建设人才，对于和专业培养目标关系较大、较密切的课程（包括基础课及专业课）减得较少，甚或不减，对于关系较少较远的课程则减得较多，或者和其他课程合并了，甚至取消了。在专业及专门化的设置方面，根据我国经济建设的需要和特点，我们所制定的有些专业的教学计划，有不少地方也是和苏联的教学计划不同的。这些都说明，新的统一的教学计划不是将苏联的教学计划生搬硬套过来，而是结合了中国的实际需要和可能条件制定的。
    但同时也应指出：这些新的统一的教学计划，还不是、也不可能是十全十美的。根据苏联的五年制教学计划制定我国的四年制教学计划，本来是一个很复杂很艰巨的工作，特别由于这些教学计划，是在我们对苏联教学计划的全部内容和实质的体会还不够深刻的情况之下制定的，今后在执行过程中一定会发现一些或大或小的缺点和问题。因而在经过了一段时间的实践之后，必然要对这些教学计划再作必要的修改。但这并不是说，这些统一的教学计划可以经常改变，因为只有经过一定时间的实践之后，才可能发现和证实这些教学计划的缺点和问题。因此，对于统一的教学计划，在未经中央高等教育部正式批准修改之前，各校都必须完全执行，不能任意修改。
    教学计划是学校进行教学工作的根本依据，学校一切工作的终极目的是为了执行和实现教学计划中所规定的一切项目和内容，培养合乎一定标准的高级建设人才。但有了统一的教学计划，还仅仅是工作的开始；如果有了统一的教学计划而没有教学计划中所规定的各个课程的统一的教学大纲和相适应的教材，则教学计划的贯彻执行便没有保证；如果教师讲课不是根据统一的教学大纲，而是根据自己的兴趣和主观见解，愿意讲什么就讲什么，愿意讲多少就讲多少，那也就无法保证培养合乎一定标准的高级建设人才。因此在制定了统一的教学计划之后，必须紧跟着根据统一的教学计划制定各课程的统一的教学大纲和有计划地编写相适应的教材。这是更深入更艰巨更细致的工作，应该有步骤地但必须及时地抓紧完成。
    中央高等教育部规定：统一的教学计划一般自一九五四—一九五五年度的新生班次开始实行，对于以前入学的各班次则必须根据统一的教学计划和各校各年级的具体情况，制定过渡性的教学计划。这样，一方面是为了尽可能保证这些学生能有较高的质量，另一方面也可使学校在执行过渡性教学计划中积极创造条件和积累经验，为一九五四—一九五五年度新生班次的逐年执行统一的教学计划打下必要的基础。
    执行统一的教学计划，一定会遇到很多困难。首先，是师资方面的困难。教学计划中规定的每门课程都必须配备必要的教师，特别是教师还不能掌握的一些专业课程或专门化课程，必须花一定时间去准备，而且应有专人去准备。其次是设备方面的困难。教学计划中所规定的实验都应该按时开出来，因此必须建立新实验室或补充现有的实验室。再其次是教材及资料方面的困难。由于教师对于有些专业课程的内容还不知道或知道得很少，由于高等学校过去从来没有进行过课程设计和毕业设计，不少教师要从新学起，而且也缺乏这方面资料的积累，因而及时地将苏联的教材翻译过来和取得有关课程设计及毕业设计的参考资料和有关厂矿方面的资料，对于教师具有特别重要的意义。
    但是，这些困难都是工作发展中的困难，各校应该努力克服，也是能够克服的。各校必须本着精简节约、发掘潜力的精神，尽量利用本校及他校的一切可能条件，按照教学计划的需要和教师工作量的规定，制定培养和配备教师的计划，以及建立新实验室和补充现有实验室的计划。至于中央高等教育部，则要就全国的需要做统盘的考虑和计划。另外还必须注意，在解决上述困难时，应当尽量取得有关业务部门和生产单位的帮助，如派遣教师下厂进修，争取业务部门派人到学校任教或兼课，借用邻近生产单位的设备来进行一时难以开出的实验，和取得为了进行课程设计及毕业设计等所必需的有关资料等。各有关的业务部门和生产单位也应该把帮助高等学校解决困难当做自己工作的一部分，尽量给以必要的和可能的支援。
    在贯彻执行统一的教学计划时，需要克服的主要困难还是一些必然会遇到的思想障碍。应该看到，很多学校在两年来积极学习苏联进行教学改革的过程中，在反复修订教学计划的过程中，行政领导方面和教师们对于为什么必须制定和执行统一的教学计划，对于统一的教学计划的严肃性，都已有了比较深刻的认识，这正是顺利贯彻和执行统一教学计划的重要保证。可是也还有不少人可能习惯于旧的、老的一套做法，而不愿按照教学计划的要求进行教学，不愿积极学习和掌握各种先进的教学方式；也会有人由于缺乏积极创造条件克服困难的精神，要求在执行统一的教学计划时给予学校以一定的“灵活权”；有些教师，在进行教学时往往会过分强调自己所授课程的重要性，不适当地增加教学分量，因而发生课程本位主义。
    新的统一的教学计划中各门课程和各种教学方式的安排，是根据学生学习应该由浅入深、循序渐进的发展规律，逐渐培养学生的独立思考能力，并贯彻理论与实际结合的原则。任何人如果随意变动课程的安排顺序或随意变动讲课、习题课、答疑、实验等时数的分配，也就破坏了统一的教学计划。这是不能允许的。
    执行统一的教学计划，是不容许任何院校或任何教研组有任意修改的“灵活权”的。因为不论学校或教研组的实际理由如何，如果同意他们能够自行对于统一的教学计划进行那管是很小的修改，其影响所及，都必然会破坏统一的教学计划而又变成各行其是了。这样，就不仅无法保证统一的培养目标，也不可能保证培养合乎一定标准的高级建设人才。为了使大家都能认识严格执行统一教学计划的必要性，中央高等教育部及有关部门和学校的行政领导方面，必须严格保证教学时间。务必使学校能够按时间开课；过多的缺课应设法补足，并须切实注意减少过多的社会活动时间。另一方面，在执行统一教学计划时，有些学校确实存在的困难，还是应该照顾的。如果是经过学校领导方面的慎重研究，认为完全执行统一的教学计划确有困难、不得不进行某种暂时的变动时，则只要经过呈请中央高等教育部批准，还是可以采取一定的暂时措施的；但学校必须同时积极创造条件，争取在最短时间内完全执行统一的教学计划。那种完全不顾实际条件、不分具体步骤，希望一蹴而就的简单想法和生硬做法，也是错误的，必须注意防止。
    整个教学计划是一个有机的整体，教学计划中所规定的课程都是互相联系互相配合的，也都是教师必须教好、学生必须学好的；就这一意义来讲，教学计划中的课程并无主要、次要或何者必须学好、何者可马虎些的差别，这就好像人的五官四肢缺一不可一样。如果有些教研组、有些教师不顾整体，主观地力图给学生尽可能多的知识，而不管学生能否接受，不管这门课程在整个教学计划中应有的作用和目的性，结果必然会造成学生负担过重，最后必然影响教学计划的顺利执行，影响所培养出来的干部的质量。
    因此，为了顺利贯彻执行统一的教学计划，各校对于统一的教学计划和在执行统一教学计划时需要克服的困难及需要解决的问题，进行一次广泛的深入的学习和讨论，是完全必要的。各校并应在这次广泛、深入学习和讨论的基础上，制定贯彻执行统一教学计划的工作计划。
