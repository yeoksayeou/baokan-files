The Yi nationality is one of the more populous ethnic minorities in southwestern China, distributed across a wide area including the provinces of Sichuan, Xikang, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi. The Greater and Lesser Liang Mountains are relatively large Yi population centers. These areas include the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region of Xikang, and the counties of Leibo, Mabian, Pingshan, Ebian, and Muchuan in the Leshan Special District of Sichuan. It is generally estimated that there are approximately 1.5 million Yi people in the region bordering Sichuan, Xikang, and Yunnan alone.

Due to the cruel rule of successive reactionary dynasties, the Yi people living in the border regions of Sichuan, Xikang, and Yunnan had been living in poverty and backwardness for thousands of years. After the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang inherited this reactionary rule, under the fallacies of "for dealing with barbarians, three points of guilt are not enough" and "to have a peaceful year, unless barbarians kill barbarians," they directly used airplanes and artillery on a large scale to massacre the Yi people. At the same time, they cultivated feudal reactionary armed forces in various places to suppress the Yi people. Even more insidious was the use of divisive tactics, "using Yi to control Yi," to achieve their goal of ruling, slaughtering, and even eliminating the Yi people. Under their oppression, exploitation, provocation, division, and deception, the Yi people killed each other, brothers killed brothers-in-law, and many families and relatives became "enemies."

"Fighting enemies" was a very painful thing, but during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, it was the most frequent occurrence in the Yi areas. In some places, "fighting enemies" sometimes happened twice a day. Before the people killed in the first fight were buried, the people killed in the second fight were brought back. Because they did not know when the "enemies" would attack, Yi men lived with guns almost all year round, carrying guns when going up the mountains to collect firewood and herd sheep, and when going to the fields to cultivate. Under these circumstances, much of the land bordering "enemy" territories was deserted. Those with many enemies dared not leave their villages for their entire lives. The roads around the villages were dug narrowly, and even when eating reunion dinners, guards had to be posted around the settlements.

Some "enemy" fights were very large in scale. In 1942, Luo Hongshiluzhi, under the instigation of Deng Xiuting, the Chiang bandit's Border Pacification Commander, attacked Wazha's family living in Dapuna, burning down many houses in one day, with dozens of casualties on both sides. A few days later, under the instigation of the reactionary government, Wazha's family attacked Baqie's family living in Bi'erna, also burning down many houses, leaving more than two hundred Yi people homeless. The following year, under the same instigation by the reactionary government, the Luomu family in northern Yanyuan and the Luo Hongzuzhizhi attacked the Ma family in eastern Yanyuan, burning down houses for dozens of miles along the Laomangou area. Two months later, the Ma family, under the direction of the reactionary government, launched a counterattack, burning down more than two hundred houses in Bazhe and Zengjiawan. As a result of this cycle of armed struggles, many Yi people's lives were sacrificed in vain, and their property was exhausted. But the Kuomintang reactionary bandit gang achieved their goal of ruling the Yi people in this tragic situation.

In 1950, the Yi areas were successively liberated, the Kuomintang reactionaries were defeated, and the root cause of provocation and division was cut off. The historical phenomenon of national oppression never returned. Based on the principle of unity and mutual assistance, the Communist Party and the People's Government, under the principle of "persuading and understanding old cases, and negotiating and mediating new cases," began to mediate the "enemy" situation. Some Yi leaders who participated in the work first abandoned their prejudices, took the initiative to request mediation, and took the lead in making concessions. After mediating some major disputes, the Yi people achieved preliminary unity. On the basis of this preliminary unity, in January 1951, the first Yi Autonomous Region People's Government was established in Hongma Magu District, Xichang County (now under the jurisdiction of Xide County). In April of the same year, the Autonomous Region People's Government was established in Zhaojue County, and in October 1952, the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region People's Government, equivalent to a special district level, was established. For the first time in history, the Yi people gained the right to be masters of their own affairs and manage their own affairs, and the internal unity of the nation was further strengthened.

From liberation to the present, the counties in Xichang Special District have mediated more than 10,000 disputes between ethnic groups and within ethnic groups. In the year and a half after the establishment of the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region, not counting the internal disputes resolved by the Yi people themselves, the People's Government alone mediated more than 3,300 internal disputes. These disputes were all caused and left over by the Kuomintang reactionary ruling clique. Now the "fighting enemies" of the Yi people has basically ended. Some major disputes have almost been resolved or stopped from developing, such as the internal disputes of the Luo Hong family in Xide County, which were caused by the Kuomintang reactionaries' instigation, incitement, and direction, and resulted in mutual killings lasting more than twenty years, with countless deaths and injuries. The disputes between the A'niu, Erji, and Shuoke branches within the Wazha family, which lasted for twenty-six years and resulted in more than seventy deaths, have all been peacefully resolved. In addition, the disputes between the Guoji family and the Ahou family lasted for thirty-seven years, with more than four hundred deaths on both sides, and six or seven hundred people being captured and sold or extorted for money; the disputes between the A'de and A'zhuang branches within the Bubu family in Butuo resulted in more than two hundred deaths. In the past, there was once a mobilization of more than 10,000 people on both sides, and more than ninety people were killed in one day. These major "enemies" have also stopped fighting after mediation.

The implementation of regional autonomy and the establishment of political organs where the Yi people are masters of their own affairs have made the Yi people deeply aware of the greatness and correctness of the Chinese Communist Party's policy of national equality. In recent years, more than 2,000 Yi people have participated in government organs at all levels. The unity between ethnic groups and within ethnic groups is increasing day by day, and the social order in the Yi areas has basically stabilized. People who used to engage in "fighting enemies" have now turned to the production front. The People's Government has also helped the Yi people develop their economy and culture. Since 1953, farmers have received hundreds of thousands of pieces of agricultural tools distributed free of charge by the People's Government, fundamentally changing the phenomenon of "slash-and-burn" cultivation and the use of wooden farm implements. Many wasteland has been reclaimed into cultivated land. Those who had no cattle in the past have almost all bought cattle. In addition, with the construction of water conservancy projects and the implementation of seed selection and fertilization, agricultural production has increased significantly. Due to the stability of social order, there is no longer fear of robbery on the roads for business, and with the leadership and support of the People's Government, primary markets have been established in places where conditions permit. Many Yi people are engaged in transportation. Local and special products sell well, and prices have generally increased. Before liberation, one hundred catties of cattle and sheep skins could only be exchanged for seven or eight catties of salt, but now one hundred catties of cattle and sheep skins can be exchanged for more than one hundred and ten catties of salt. According to statistics, the income of the Yi people has increased by an average of 20% to 50% compared to 1950, and in some places it has even more than doubled. People's lives have been initially improved. In the past, many Yi people wore linen clothes, but now only six or seven out of a hundred people wear linen, and in some places, you can't see people wearing linen at all. Previously, they couldn't eat salt a few times a year, but now they have salt in every meal.

In recent years, governments at all levels have established various cadre schools and training classes, giving cadres of all ethnic groups almost all the opportunity to study. They have organized various visits, allowing some people who have never left their villages for thirty miles to visit Chengdu, Chongqing, and even Beijing. They have convened various meetings, allowing former "enemies" to come together to discuss matters. They have established schools, and many children have entered ethnic primary schools, reading textbooks compiled and printed in their own language. The reconciliation of "enemies" and the development of medical and health work have reduced the population mortality rate and increased fertility, and even cattle and sheep have become doubly prosperous.

The mountainous areas where the Yi people lived, which were like prisons in the past, have now begun to transform into beautiful and warm paradises for the Yi people. Now, the elderly no longer worry that their children and grandchildren will have no clothes to wear or food to eat. Mothers no longer worry that their sons will die young. Young men say: Now we can take off our clothes and unload our guns to sleep. Young women say: Now we are not afraid of our husbands being killed and becoming widows.

In recent years, we have deeply realized that it is fundamentally impossible for ethnic minorities to achieve national equality without the guidance of Marxism-Leninism on the national question. The national policy formulated by the Chinese Communist Party based on the theory of Marxism-Leninism on the national question and combined with China's actual situation is the key to solving China's national problems. We believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party and the higher-level People's Government, with the help of the Han elder brother and the efforts of all department workers, following the correct and great general line, the Yi people will surely be able to gradually transition to a socialist society.

    彝族人民团结起来了
    全国人民代表大会代表
      西康省凉山彝族自治区人民政府主席  瓦渣木基（彝族）
    彝族是西南各少数民族中人口较多的一个民族，它分布的地区很广，四川、西康、云南、贵州、广西等省都有。大小凉山是比较大的彝族聚居区。大小凉山包括西康的凉山彝族自治区和四川乐山专区的雷波、马边、屏山、峨边、沐川各县。一般估计，单是在四川、西康、云南边界这个区域内的彝族就约有一百五十万人左右。
    由于历代反动皇朝的残酷统治，居住在四川、西康、云南边界地区的彝族，千百年来，一直过着贫困落后的生活。国民党蒋介石匪帮继承这种反动统治后，在“见蛮不整三分罪”、“要过太平年，除非蛮杀蛮”的谰言下，一面直接大规模地使用飞机大炮来屠杀彝人；一面在各地培养封建反动武装来镇压彝人；更毒辣的是使用挑拨离间、“以彝制彝”的手段，来达到它统治、残杀以至消灭彝族人民的目的。彝族人民在他们这种压迫、剥削、挑拨、离间、欺骗之下，弟兄相杀、郎舅相杀，多少家门亲戚都变成了“冤家”。
      “打冤家”是一件非常惨痛的事情，但在国民党反动统治时代，它又是彝族地区发生得最多的事情。有些地方，有时一天要打两次“冤家”。第一次打死的人还未烧埋，第二次打死的人又抬回来了。由于不知“冤家”会在什么时候来袭击，彝人男子们差不多整年都是荷枪实弹地生活着，上山打柴、放羊，下地耕种，都要带枪。在这种情形下，很多“冤家”接壤地区的土地都荒芜了。冤家多的人，
  一辈子也不敢离开自己的村落。村落四周的道路都挖得窄窄的，甚至吃团年饭也得在住地四周安好警戒。
    有些“冤家”打起来规模很大，一九四二年罗洪矢鲁支在蒋匪靖边司令邓秀廷的挑拨下，进攻住在达普那打的瓦渣家，一天之内烧毁房屋许多间，双方伤亡几十人。过了几天，瓦渣家在反动政府的挑拨下进攻住在比耳那打的八且家，也烧毁房屋许多间，有二百多户彝民流离失所。第二年在反动政府同样的挑拨下，盐源北部的倮姆家和罗洪祖祖支进攻盐源东部的马家，把老漫沟一带几十里的房屋烧光，两个月后马家又受反动政府的指使，进行反攻，把巴哲、曾家湾的房子烧了二百多间。这样循环械斗的结果，许多彝族人民的生命无谓地牺牲了，财产也消耗殆尽。但是国民党反动匪帮却在彝族这种惨境中达到了他们统治彝人的目的。
    一九五○年彝族地区相继解放，国民党反动派被打垮了，挑拨离间的祸根挖断了，历史上的那种民族压迫的现象一去不复返了。共产党、人民政府本着团结互助的方针，在“旧案说服谅解，新案协商调解”的原则下，开始进行调解“冤家”的工作。一些参加工作的彝族领袖人物，首先放弃了成见，主动要求调解，并且带头让步。调解了一些关系重大的纠纷之后，彝族人民得到了初步的团结。在这个初步团结的基础上，一九五一年一月，西昌县红毛麻姑区（现改属喜德县）第一个彝族自治区人民政府成立了，同年四月昭觉县又建立了自治区人民政府，一九五二年十月又成立了相当于专区一级的凉山彝族自治区人民政府。彝族人民有史以来第一次得到当家作主、办理自己的事情的权利，民族内部的团结随着进一步加强了。
    从解放到现在，西昌专区各县，前后调解了民族间和民族内部的纠纷一万多件；凉山彝族自治区成立后的一年半中，彝人自己和解的不算，单是通过人民政府调解的内部纠纷就有三千三百多件。这些纠纷都是国民党反动统治集团所造成和遗留下来的。现在彝族人民的“打冤家”已基本上结束了。一些大的纠纷差不多都已解决或停止发展，如喜德县罗洪家内部由于国民党反动派的挑拨、煽动、指使，一方驱逐另一方，因而引起的互相残杀，历时二十多年、死伤简直无法统计的纠纷；瓦渣家内部阿牛、耳基、说克三支打了二十六年、死了七十多人的纠纷，都已和平解决了。其他，果基家与阿侯家的纠纷，前后打了三十七年，双方死了四百多人，互相抓了六、七百人出卖或索取钱财；布拖比补家内部阿的、阿庄两支的纠纷，打死了二百多人，过去曾经有一次双方动员到一万多人，在一天之中就打死了九十多人，这些大“冤家”，经过调处，也停止了械斗。
    实行区域自治，建立彝族人民自己当家作主的政权机关，使彝族人民深刻地认识到中国共产党的民族平等政策的伟大、正确，几年来参加各级政府机关工作的彝人已有二千多人。民族间和民族内部的团结日益加强，彝区社会秩序已基本安定，过去经常从事“打冤家”的人都已转到了生产战线。人民政府又帮助彝族人民发展经济、文化事业。农民从一九五三年起已得到人民政府无偿发放的几十万件农具，根本改变了“刀耕火种”和使用木制农具的现象，很多荒地已开成熟地；过去没有耕牛的，差不多都已买上了耕牛；再加上兴修了水利，进行了选种施肥，农业生产量显著提高。由于社会秩序安定，四出经商路上已不怕抢劫，再加上人民政府的领导和支持，有条件的地方都建立了初级市场，很多彝人经营驮运。土、特产品畅销，而且价格普遍提高了。解放前一百斤牛羊皮只能换七、八斤盐，现在一百斤牛羊皮已可换一百一十多斤盐了。据统计，现在彝人的收入比较一九五○年平均增加了百分之二十到五十，有些地方还超过了一倍以上。人民的生活已初步得到改善。过去彝族群众很多穿麻布衣服，现在一百个人中只有六、七个人穿麻布，有些地方根本就看不见穿麻布的人了。以前全年吃不上几次盐的，现在每餐饭都有盐吃了。
    几年来，各级人民政府开办了各种干部学校和训练班，使各民族干部差不多都有机会学习；组织了各种参观，使一些从来没有离村三十里的人，也远到成都、重庆甚至北京参观；召集了各种会议，使以前的“冤家”也在一起来商量事情；建立了学校，很多小孩子已进了民族小学，读用自己的文字编印的课本；“冤家”的和解和医药卫生工作的开展，人口死亡率已减小、生育增加，就是牛羊牲畜也加倍的旺盛了。
    过去像牢狱一样的彝族人民居住的山区，今天已开始变成彝族人民美丽、温暖的乐园。现在，老年人已不再愁儿孙没衣穿没饭吃；母亲们已不再担心儿子会遭短命；青年男子们说：现在可以脱下衣服、解下枪弹睡觉了；年轻的妇女们说：现在不怕丈夫被人打死而当寡妇了。
    几年来我们深深体会到：少数民族要想得到民族平等，离开了马克思、列宁主义关于民族问题的指示是根本不可能的。中国共产党根据马克思列宁主义关于民族问题的理论，结合中国的实际情况所订出来的民族政策，是解决我国民族问题的钥匙。我们相信，在共产党和上级人民政府的领导下，在汉族老大哥的帮助、各部门工作人员的努力下，遵循着正确、伟大的总路线前进，彝族人民是一定能逐步过渡到社会主义社会去的。
