Strive to Supply the Capital's People with Over Three Million Jin of Vegetables
	Yin Weichen, Director of Huangtugang Township Agricultural Production Cooperative, Beijing Model Worker

	This year, our production cooperative has expanded from 33 households last year to over 150 households. The total vegetable planting area of the cooperative has increased by more than 470 mu compared to 1953, including 109 mu that were directly converted from dry land to vegetable fields. The total vegetable production has increased to over five million jin. The demand for means of production has also increased compared to previous years. Take diluted manure as an example, we need more than 31,000 buckets a year. This year, we are producing so many vegetables and need so many means of production. If we have to engage in both production and sales, and also purchase means of production, we will be too busy to handle it all. We felt that our strength was not enough. When formulating this year's annual vegetable production plan, we felt this difficulty very acutely.

	At this critical juncture, the Party and the government called on us to sign production-sales combination contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives. We responded to this call. Everyone also recognized the benefits of the "production-sales combination contract." The contract stipulates that the supply and marketing cooperative will purchase the production cooperative's vegetables according to the quantity and prevailing market price, and unsold vegetables cannot be returned. The supply and marketing cooperative also supplies the production cooperative with many means of production according to needs, supporting our production. According to the combination contract signed this time, we entrusted 500,000 bundles of small radishes and 700,000 jin of potatoes to the supply and marketing cooperative. The supply and marketing cooperative also supplied us with a large amount of fertilizer, seeds, pesticides, and small farm tools according to seasonal needs. The results of more than half a year of implementation have proved that it has played a great role in our achieving a bumper harvest and ensuring the income of cooperative members, which has fundamentally changed our understanding of the contract, and the members are very satisfied.

	After we signed a combination contract with the supply and marketing cooperative, the sales of vegetables were guaranteed. We no longer worried about the produced vegetables not being sold or even rotting. We could concentrate more on doing a good job in production, and the production in the cooperative became more planned. Last year, we did not sign a production-sales combination contract. The cooperative planted 35 mu of potatoes and harvested more than 100,000 jin. We produced and sold the potatoes ourselves. We started to market them in early July. We could only use two carts a day to transport the potatoes to the market for sale, which invisibly prolonged the storage time of the potatoes at home. When the potatoes were sold out, more than 8,000 jin had rotted, accounting for 8 percent of the total output, which meant a loss of more than three million yuan. This year, the cooperative planted 297 mu of potatoes and harvested more than 1,050,000 jin. According to the production-sales combination contract, the supply and marketing cooperative started selling them in mid-June. Because of the fast sales, the potatoes damaged this year were more than 50,000 jin less than last year, equivalent to more than 20 million yuan.

	With the combination contract, we saved a lot of labor, animal power and expenses in selling vegetables. Last year, our cooperative went to the market once a day. This year, we sold potatoes twice a day, and the transportation efficiency was doubled. Taking the sale of small radishes last year as an example, we had to send four carts at a time, and two people had to sell them. We would come back whenever they were sold out. Sometimes the vegetables could not be sold, and we had to put them down, and every day of storage was a loss. Moreover, the price of vegetables fluctuated, with one price for early sales and another price for late sales, which would also cause losses. This year, when selling small radishes and potatoes, we sent five carts at a time or ten carts twice. The goods arrived and the carts returned, and the people and livestock could come back to do other work. Leaving one person in the market could handle everything. The price of vegetables was assessed according to the market price at the time of arrival, and the accounts were settled. This year alone, we saved more than 200 workdays by selling potatoes, which is a great convenience!

	With the production-sales combination contract, the supply and marketing cooperative can supply us with means of production in a timely and sufficient manner, which is one of the important factors to ensure our bumper harvest. Taking this year's potatoes as an example, the average yield per mu reached more than 3,500 jin, an increase of more than 70 percent compared to ordinary farmers. There were 8.85 mu with a high yield, with a yield of 5,355 jin per mu, breaking our cooperative's high-yield record of 5,123 jin per mu of potatoes in 1952. If the supply and marketing cooperative had not supplied us with more than 15,000 buckets of diluted manure this year according to the contract, making timely topdressing, how could we have achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest? The supplies needed by the production cooperative in the second half of this year have also been prepared by the supply and marketing cooperative, and we don't have to worry about them.

	In short, the production-sales combination contract is really a good way to develop production and improve production. With it, our production cooperative will be more consolidated and will expand further. With it, we can wholeheartedly study technology, improve farming methods, and increase production. At present, we have formulated the production plan for the second half of the year. We have decided that the sowing area for autumn vegetables will be 476 mu, an expansion of 34 mu compared to the original plan, and 245 mu more than the same period in 1953; the number of greenhouses will increase by 32 compared to the original plan, and 153 more than in 1953. We require that the average yield of the ten autumn vegetables increase by more than 60 percent compared to last year. If we complete this plan, we will supply the capital's people with more than three million jin of vegetables and more than 168,000 jin of fine vegetables. We believe that the production-sales combination contract signed with the supply and marketing cooperative will definitely become a powerful guarantee for us to develop vegetable production, increase production, and complete the annual production increase plan.

    争取供给首都人民三百多万斤蔬菜
    黄土岗乡农业生产合作社主任  北京市劳动模范  殷维臣
    今年，我们生产合作社由去年的三十三户扩大到一百五十多户，全社蔬菜播种面积比一九五三年增加四百七十多亩，其中由旱地直接改为菜地的就有一百零九亩。全年蔬菜生产量增加到五百余万斤。生产资料的需要量也比往年多了。就说稀粪吧，一年就需要三万一千多桶。今年生产这么多的蔬菜，生产上又需用这么多的生产资料，要是我们既要搞生产，又要搞推销，又得购买生产资料，无论如何我们也忙不过来，在力量上也是感到不够的。我们在制订今年全年蔬菜生产计划当中，十分迫切地感到这方面的难处。
    正在这个困难关头，党和政府号召我们和供销合作社订立产销结合合同。我们响应了这个号召。大家也都认识到“产销结合合同”的好处。合同内规定了供销合作社按照数量随市价包销生产合作社的蔬菜，销售不出去不能退回，供销合作社还根据需要，供应生产合作社许多生产资料，支持我们生产。根据这次订立的结合合同，我们把小萝卜五十万把、土豆七十万斤交由供销合作社，供销合作社并以大量肥料、籽种、农药、小农具等，根据季节需要供应我们。经过半年多来实行的结果证明，它对我们获得丰收、保证社员收入起到莫大的作用，使我们对合同的认识已有了根本的转变，社员们都很满意。
    我们和供销合作社订立结合合同后，蔬菜销路有了保障，再不愁生产出来的蔬菜卖不出去，甚至烂掉了，就能更专心一意地搞好生产，社里的生产也更加有计划了。去年，我们没有订立产销结合合同，社里种了三十五亩土豆，收到十万余斤。自己生产，自己推销。七月初旬开始上市，一天只能用两辆车把土豆运到市场上去出卖，无形中延长了土豆在家里存放的时间，等土豆卖完，烂掉的有八千多斤，占总产量的百分之八，即少收入三百多万元。今年全社种土豆二百九十七亩，收了一百零五万余斤，按照产销结合合同，供销合作社从六月中旬开始销售。由于销售的快，今年土豆较去年少损坏五万多斤，折合二千多万元。
    有了结合合同，我们在推销蔬菜方面节省了很多人工、畜力与开支。去年，我们社里每天上市一趟，今年卖土豆每天上市两趟，运输效率提高一倍。拿去年卖小萝卜来说，一次去四辆车，得有两个人去卖。什么时候卖完什么时候回来。有时候蔬菜卖不了，还得搁下，放一天是一天的损失。再说菜价忽涨忽落，早卖一个价，晚卖另一个价，又要遭受损失。今年卖小萝卜、卖土豆，一次去五个车或两次去十个车，货到车回，人、牲口回来还可干别的活。留一个人在市场里什么事都办了。菜价按货到时的市价评定好了，账也就算好了。仅今年卖土豆就省了二百多个工，这该有多大方便啊！
    有了产销结合合同，供销合作社能及时地充分地供应我们生产资料，这是保证我们庄稼丰收的重要因素之一。拿今年的土豆来说，每亩平均产量达到三千五百斤以上，比一般农民增产百分之七十以上。有八点八五亩高额产量，每亩产量五千三百五十五斤，突破了我们社一九五二年土豆每亩产五千一百二十三斤的丰产纪录。要不是供销合作社今年根据合同，供应我们稀粪一万五千余桶，作到适时追肥，怎能会全面丰产呢？今年下半年生产合作社用的东西，现在供销合作社也早准备好了，我们都用不着发愁。
    总之，产销结合合同真是个发展生产、提高生产的好办法。有了它，我们生产社将更加巩固，更会扩大。有了它，我们就能一条心钻研技术、改进耕作方法，增加生产。目前，我们已制定了下半年的生产计划。决定秋菜播种面积为四百七十六亩，比原计划扩大三十四亩，比一九五三年同时期多种二百四十五亩；温室比原计划增加三十二间，比一九五三年增加一百五十三间。我们要求秋季十种蔬菜的平均产量比去年增加百分之六十以上。若完成这一计划，我们将以三百余万斤蔬菜及十六万八千多斤细菜，供应首都人民的需要。我们相信，和供销合作社所订产销结合合同，定会成为我们发展蔬菜生产、增加产量，完成全年增产计划的有力保证。
