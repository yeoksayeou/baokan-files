    Chiang Bandit Exploits the People of Taiwan in the Name of Mid-Autumn Festival Comfort to the Chiang Bandit Army, Squeezing Money and Wealth
    The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, which is adept at seeking out and exploiting resources, is now using the Mid-Autumn Festival to extort money from the Taiwanese compatriots.
    The "Military Friends General Society," one of the institutions through which the Chiang bandits extort money, launches its branch organizations every year during festivals such as New Year's Day, Dragon Boat Festival, and Mid-Autumn Festival to carry out blackmail against the Taiwanese people in the name of "comforting the troops." According to Taiwanese newspapers, with the Mid-Autumn Festival approaching, this "Military Friends General Society" made a "comforting troops decision" on August 30, forcing the Taiwanese people to make so-called "Mid-Autumn Festival comforting troops donations" to the Chiang bandit army. The branch organs of this organization in various parts of Taiwan immediately launched extortion activities against the residents. The scope of the extortion is extremely wide. Whether it is factories, shops, households, farmers, or students, all must "donate." The method of "donation" is that the "Military Friends Society" in various places first stipulates an amount, and then forces the apportionment. For example, the "Military Friends Society" of Hsinchu County plans to squeeze 135,000 pseudo-Taiwan dollars in "comforting troops" funds every year, and this Mid-Autumn Festival plans to squeeze 45,000 yuan, with special personnel designated by various townships to force donations from house to house according to the population.
    In areas that have suffered severe droughts this year, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique not only fails to provide relief but continues to squeeze in the name of "comforting the troops." The aforementioned Hsinchu County is one of the areas that have suffered severe droughts. The people of Miaoli, another severely affected county, were forced to "donate" 8,000 catties of pork and 60,000 mooncakes this time, and no actual objects were accepted; all had to be converted into cash according to the price stipulated by the "Military Friends Society."

### 蒋贼以中秋节慰劳蒋贼军为名  向台湾人民榨取钱财

    蒋贼以中秋节慰劳蒋贼军为名
    向台湾人民榨取钱财
    以搜刮盘剥为能事的蒋介石卖国集团，现在又在利用中秋节向台湾同胞榨取钱财。
    蒋贼搜刮钱财的机构之一——所谓“军人之友总社”，在每年的元旦、端午、中秋等节期，都要发动它的分支机构，以“劳军”为名向台湾人民进行勒索。据台湾报纸透露，由于中秋节将到，这个“军人之友总社”在八月三十日作出了一个“劳军决定”，强迫台湾人民为蒋贼军进行所谓“中秋节劳军捐献”。这个机构在台湾各地的分支机关随即向居民展开了勒索活动。勒索的范围极为广泛，无论工厂、商店、住户、农民、学生，一律都要“捐献”。“捐献”的办法是由各地的“军人之友社”先行规定一个数额，然后强迫分摊。例如新竹县的
  “军人之友社”计划每年要搜刮“劳军”款项十三万五千元伪台币，这次中秋节计划搜刮四万五千元，由各乡镇指派专人按照户口挨家强迫认捐。
    在今年遭受严重旱灾的地区，蒋介石卖国集团不但不予救济，反而继续以“劳军”的名义进行搜刮。上述新竹县就是遭受严重旱灾的地区。另一个严重受灾县苗栗的人民这次被迫“捐献”猪肉八千斤，月饼六万个，而且不要实物，一律要按照“军人之友社”规定的价格折成现金缴纳。
