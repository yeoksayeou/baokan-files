    New Power Transmission and Substation Project Begins in Taiyuan
    With the victorious progress of the construction of the new Taiyuan No. 1 Power Plant, the 1203 power transmission and substation project commenced construction on August 21st. Currently, in the fields of the western suburbs of Taiyuan, electrical workers are erecting cable lines, and cranes are extending their giant arms to erect concrete poles. After burying them, workers climb to the high altitude to install electrical equipment.
    As the date of power generation at the new Taiyuan No. 1 Power Plant approaches, the construction of high-voltage transmission lines is becoming increasingly urgent. Since the Taiyuan Electric Power Bureau Engineering Team accepted this urgent construction task, they have rapidly made various construction preparations despite continuous rain: transporting the giant concrete poles to the construction site and making a construction operation plan. On August 21st, the weather was clear, and the employees gathered at the construction site to hold a groundbreaking ceremony and signed a collective contract, striving to complete the entire power transmission and substation project before October 20th.

    太原新建送变电工程开工
    随着新建太原第一发电厂建设工程的胜利前进，一二○三送变电工程已于八月二十一日开工建设了。目前，在太原西郊的田野里，电气工人们正架设电缆线，起重机伸起巨臂，把混凝土杆子竖起，埋好后工人们就爬上高空安装电器设备。
    新建太原第一发电厂发电日期日益迫近，高压输电线的建设已迫不及待。自从太原电业局工程队接受此项紧急施工任务后，在阴雨连绵的情况下，迅速做好各项施工准备：把巨型混凝土杆子运到工地，作出了施工作业计划。八月二十一日天气晴朗，职工聚集在工地上举行了开工典礼，并签订了集体合同，争取在十月二十日以前全部完成送变电工程。
