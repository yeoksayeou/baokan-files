    Congratulating the Opening of the National People's Congress Meeting
    A Historic Event for the Chinese People
    ——Editorial from "Democratic Korea"
      The "Democratic Korea" published an article on the 16th entitled "A Historic Event for the Chinese People," commenting on the convocation of the First Session of the First National People's Congress of our country.
    The article said: The successful convening of the First Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China is an important guarantee for further consolidating the people's democratic system and smoothly carrying out socialist construction, and it is also a historic event reflecting the new victory of the Chinese people's revolution.
    The article said: The victory of the people's revolution in China is closely related to world peace, especially the peace, security, and progress of Asia. Therefore, today, millions of people around the world who love peace, security, and progress unanimously and warmly congratulate the convening of this meeting, which demonstrates the brilliant victory of the Chinese people's revolution. The founding of the great People's Republic of China is a sign of the arrival of a new era in Asia and one of the great events in human history after the victory of the Great Russian Socialist October Revolution.
    The article continued: The successful completion of the first general election in Chinese history clearly shows that the scope of democratic life of the Chinese people has expanded, the ability of the people to manage their own country has improved, and the people's democratic system in China has been firmly established on a broader mass base. Through this general election, the political consciousness of the Chinese people has been further enhanced, the unity among all nationalities has been further strengthened, and the people's democratic system and its foundation—the worker-peasant alliance—are more consolidated than ever.
    The article concluded: The entire Korean people, who have consolidated their long-standing brotherly friendship and unity with the Chinese people in the struggle against the common enemy, warmly welcome the historic event of the Chinese people—the convening of the First Session of the First National People's Congress—and extend brotherly congratulations to the Congress and the entire Chinese people.

    The article said: The Chinese people have established a truly democratic regime. This regime has brought the Chinese people genuine democratic rights and interests that do not exist in capitalist countries.

    Overseas Chinese Have Representatives Participating in National Affairs
    ——Talks Published in Newspapers by Overseas Chinese in Burma
    Rangoon dispatch: Prominent overseas Chinese figures from all walks of life in Burma published talks in "New Rangoon Daily" and "People's Daily" on the 8th and 9th, supporting the 30 overseas Chinese representatives to the First National People's Congress elected at the Expanded Conference on Overseas Chinese Affairs in 1954 recently held in Beijing. They unanimously believe that the overseas Chinese representatives elected this time are all highly respected and fully meet the wishes of overseas Chinese.
    Qiu Yijue, Chairman of the Burmese Chinese Chamber of Commerce, said: I am very happy that overseas Chinese have representatives attending the National People's Congress meeting. With representatives, we can fully reflect the situation and wishes of overseas Chinese to the government. Li Yanxing, Chairman of the Burmese Chinese Industrial and Commercial Advancement Association, said: "Overseas Chinese were 'overseas orphans' in the past, despised by others. Today, our overseas Chinese have representatives participating in the management of national affairs." Yang Laoqing, Chairman of the Burmese Xing Shang General Association, said: It is a beginning in the history of overseas Chinese for compatriots to participate in the management of national affairs through their own representatives. The so-called "National Assembly representatives" of the Kuomintang reactionary regime in the past were an insult to overseas Chinese. The representatives elected today meet our will and wishes. Chen Xiulian, Chairman of the Burmese Chinese Women's Association, said: When I saw the list of overseas Chinese representatives elected at the Expanded Conference on Overseas Chinese Affairs, I shed tears of joy. It is unprecedented for overseas Chinese to participate in the management of national affairs, and this is the glory of more than ten million overseas compatriots. Chen Huarong, Vice Chairman of the Burmese Chinese Women's Association, said: "Although I am so old, I have never seen our motherland take such care and concern for overseas Chinese as it does today, which makes me feel very excited." Huang Huixin, Chairman of the Burmese Chinese Retailers Association, pointed out: "Today, our motherland elects its own representatives to govern the country, which is a true manifestation of democracy." Wang Jiesheng, Chairman of the Burmese Chinese Shop Assistants Union, Liang Hongguang, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, and responsible persons of overseas Chinese organizations such as the Rice Mill Association, Yinghe Guild Hall, Yunnan Association of Fellow Townsmen in Burma, and Huian Association of Fellow Townsmen in Burma also happily delivered talks, expressing their trust and support for the 30 overseas Chinese representatives elected.
    The Consistent Wish of Overseas Compatriots in Burma
    ——Editorial Published by Burmese "New Rangoon Daily"
    Rangoon dispatch: The Burmese "New Rangoon Daily" published an editorial on the 9th entitled "The Consistent Wish of Overseas Compatriots in Burma," supporting the resolutions of the Expanded Conference on Overseas Chinese Affairs held recently in Beijing and supporting the joint declaration of various democratic parties and people's organizations of the motherland for the liberation of Taiwan.
    The editorial said: The Expanded Conference on Overseas Chinese Affairs itself fully demonstrates the care of the motherland government and people for overseas Chinese. The editorial expressed excitement at the solemn election of 30 overseas Chinese representatives to the First National People's Congress at this Expanded Conference on Overseas Chinese Affairs in a spirit of high responsibility to the people. The editorial said: "The overseas Chinese representatives elected at the meeting are broadly representative and meet the wishes of the vast number of overseas compatriots, and our overseas compatriots express their utmost sincere support." The editorial also said: The First Session of the First National People's Congress will open on the 15th of this month, and our overseas compatriots feel very honored to participate in the formulation of the constitution and the management of other major national affairs as masters through their own elected representatives.
    After criticizing Jiang thief's crimes of betraying the country and harming overseas Chinese, the editorial wrote: Only by liberating Taiwan can the task of liberating all of China be completely completed, the Taiwan compatriots be rescued, and the lives of the relatives of returned overseas Chinese in the coastal hometowns of Fujian and Guangdong be further guaranteed. Taiwan and Fujian and Guangdong are only separated by a strip of water, and the overseas compatriots in Burma, mainly from Fujian and Guangdong, have an unshirkable duty to support the people of the motherland in liberating Taiwan.
