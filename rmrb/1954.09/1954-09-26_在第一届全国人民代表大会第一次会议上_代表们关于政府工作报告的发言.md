At the First Session of the First National People's Congress, representatives delivered speeches on the Government Work Report. Below are the speeches by several representatives:

**Speech by Luo Ronghuan**

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I am greatly excited after listening to Premier Zhou Enlai's report on the government work. I fully support it. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, our country, which has experienced a century of turmoil, has achieved a series of victories in both domestic and foreign affairs under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government, and the efforts of the entire nation. The facts of the past five years have vividly demonstrated the remarkable superiority of our people's democratic system, which is led by the working class and based on the alliance between workers and peasants. Under this superior social system, all democratic classes, all democratic parties, and all nationalities in our country have united closely, forming a tremendous social force that no power can stop us from advancing. Of course, not everything has been perfectly handled in our work, and there are still some shortcomings and mistakes. However, we are determined to continuously improve our work, and we are indeed improving. Therefore, we will surely build our country into a great socialist state.

In the past five years, the government and the people have shown great care and love for the military. Our people have made tremendous efforts to support and inspire the Chinese People's Volunteers, ensuring the victory of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. Our government and people have continuously strengthened the modernization of the Chinese People's Liberation Army from all aspects and have deeply cared for the welfare of revolutionary soldiers. This spring, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Chinese People's Association for Aid to the Volunteers organized the National Delegation to Visit the People's Liberation Army, which visited the troops and conducted comprehensive visits. All these have greatly inspired and educated the commanders and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

In the past five years, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, under the meticulous care of the government and the people, has continued to carry out the tasks of unifying the country and eliminating bandits, and has vigilantly defended the land, air, and sea of our motherland on remote borders and long coastlines. In the past five years, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has closely united the ethnic minorities on our borders and the fishermen along the coast, helped them with production, and organized them to fight against the enemy. In the past five years, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has also actively participated in the economic construction of reclamation, road construction, river regulation, bridge construction, forest development, and factory construction, and has helped the people with drought relief, flood control, pest control, farming, rescue, and disaster relief. The demobilized and transferred personnel of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, as well as the families of soldiers, have also worked hard in production and actively participated in the national economic construction and agricultural mutual aid and cooperation. In the past five years, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has simultaneously carried out modernization. A strong People's Air Force, People's Navy, and other special forces have been established. A large-scale cultural study movement has effectively improved the cultural level of the commanders and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. Regular military training, political education, and regular cultural studies have been continuously carried out. All these are of great significance for further improving the combat effectiveness of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, consolidating national defense, and supporting and safeguarding the socialist construction of the state. However, since the liberation of the country, some personnel in the army have developed a sense of pride, self-importance, and a desire for comfort and enjoyment, and there have been phenomena of violating government laws and harming the interests of the people in certain aspects, especially in military engineering construction. There have also been some phenomena of localism in work. These are absolutely unacceptable. These phenomena have already been corrected to some extent and are being corrected. In this historical period of our country's transition to a socialist society, due to the existence of imperialist encirclement, domestic classes have not yet been eliminated, so our army must remain highly vigilant at all times and constantly use the weapons of criticism and self-criticism to timely prevent and correct various undesirable tendencies.

Now, our sacred and indivisible territory—Taiwan—has not yet been liberated. We will not allow the traitorous clique of Chiang Kai-shek, backed by American imperialism, to continue to occupy Taiwan. The Chinese People's Liberation Army will definitely strive to complete the glorious task of liberating Taiwan. To this end, the Chinese People's Liberation Army will further strengthen the training and tempering of the combined amphibious operations of the army, navy, and air force, and closely coordinate military struggle with political and economic struggle, actively strike the enemy, and safeguard the socialist construction of the motherland. Although there are still many difficulties ahead of us, these difficulties are surmountable. The struggle of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan will, like the past struggles to liberate the mainland and aid Korea, surely achieve the final victory!

**Speech by Ma Xulun**

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's report on the government work and Chairman Guo Moruo's speech on cultural and educational work. Now, I would like to briefly supplement the main shortcomings of higher education work and the direction of future efforts. I request the representatives to correct me.

After the initial recovery and rectification of higher education nationwide during the early years of the founding of the country, by 1952, based on the significant achievements of the nationwide movement for the ideological reform of teachers, we learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, reformed the educational system, adjusted the system and specialties, began teaching reforms, and emphasized the cultivation of workers and peasants cadres, thus fundamentally changing the old higher education into a new higher education led by the working class and adapted to the needs of national construction. It has also developed considerably. According to statistics for the 1953-1954 academic year, there are 181 higher education institutions nationwide, with 216,765 students (including graduate students), an increase of 40% compared to the highest year during the Kuomintang rule. Among them, higher industrial schools have developed the fastest, with 81,284 engineering students, an increase of 167% compared to 1949.

In the process of rectification, reform, and development, due to our lack of understanding of the policies and situation, weak planning, and insufficient experience, many serious shortcomings have occurred in our work. The main ones are: in the development of higher education, we emphasized quantity over quality, with a great deal of blindness; in the organization and arrangement of system and specialty adjustments, there were many inappropriate places; in learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and carrying out teaching reforms, due to lack of adequate preparation beforehand, the requirements were too high and too urgent, and specific guidance was insufficient; schools had just been adjusted, work was not ready, but teachers and students participated in various social and political activities inside and outside the school too much, resulting in widespread chaos in various schools, seriously affecting teaching effectiveness and the health of teachers and students. Especially during this period, many schools did poorly in uniting intellectuals, and paid insufficient attention to educating students on study discipline, resulting in many teachers' academic expertise and work enthusiasm not being fully utilized, and the unity among teachers and the relationship between teachers and students not being normal in many schools. These shortcomings have all affected the smooth progress of teaching work. This is something I myself should be responsible for.

In early 1953, the Central Committee proposed the policy of "rectification, consolidation, key development, and quality improvement" for cultural and educational work, emphasizing the direction of teaching reform to "learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and combine it with Chinese reality," and especially pointing out the importance of correctly implementing the policy of uniting and transforming intellectuals. Over the past year, higher education workers, under the guidance of the CPC local committees and local people's governments, and with the help of various aspects, have basically reversed the above tendencies and overcome the chaos. Generally, schools have achieved the goal of making teaching the center of all work, actively revising teaching plans, syllabi, and compiling textbooks, improving teaching methods, improving student life, and paying attention to physical exercise, thus generally stabilizing the teaching order, improving the health of teachers and students, and gradually improving teaching quality, making the work of cultivating construction cadres gradually fall into the track of national planning.

However, looking at the current situation, our higher education still has a certain degree of blindness, and the teaching quality is generally still low. Our political and ideological leadership and political work in schools are still very weak, and the health of teachers and students is not good. These problems urgently need us to solve them vigorously.

According to the general task of the transitional period of the state, the task of higher education is to cultivate, in a corresponding manner, cadres who serve the socialist construction of the state, have a sound physique, love the motherland, have a certain level of Marxist-Leninist ideology, and can master advanced science and technology for various specialized construction. To achieve this task, future higher education work must strengthen planning and greatly improve teaching quality and political quality. The main work includes the following aspects:

1. To achieve the task of cultivating cadres for various specialized construction of the state in a planned and proportional manner, we must quickly and correctly calculate the needs of the state construction for various specialized cadres and formulate a plan to cultivate cadres by specialty and proportion.

2. Further combine Chinese reality to learn from Soviet experience. In addition to quickly completing the formulation and revision of teaching plans and syllabi, compiling a large number of textbooks, and actively cultivating and improving teachers, we must also formulate and implement various necessary teaching systems in a planned and step-by-step manner to further bring school work into the track, more effectively guarantee teaching order, carry out scientific research work, and improve teaching quality. In learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and improving teaching quality, on the one hand, we must continue to overcome the erroneous ideas of pride and self-satisfaction and unwillingness to learn from the Soviet Union; on the other hand, we must pay attention to preventing the tendency of mechanical transplantation without combining the current specific situation of our country.

3. Strengthen political work in schools, conduct regular socialist ideological education for students, cultivate good moral qualities among students, improve their thoughts of loving the motherland, loving labor, loving the working people, loving public property, and observing laws and regulations. Rectify the academic atmosphere, strengthen the education of respecting teachers. Correctly implement the policy of uniting and transforming intellectuals, enhance the unity of teachers. Strengthen the study of Marxist-Leninist theory among teachers. Under leadership, carry out academic and ideological debates to promote scientific research work.

4. To cultivate cadres with a sound physique, we must pay attention to improving the health of teachers and students and cannot be negligent. We must continue to seriously implement various measures to improve the health of teachers and students, especially to reduce the heavy burden of students inside and outside the classroom.

We know that after the promulgation of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, the socialist construction of our country will develop even faster, and the task of cultivating construction cadres will become even more arduous. All higher education workers should, under the leadership of the Central Committee, under the supervision and support of the people of the whole country, work diligently and with redoubled efforts, overcome difficulties, and give full play to potential, so that higher education work can more effectively serve the great cause of socialist construction.

**Speech by Li Xiannian**

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's report on the government work. I would like to express some opinions on the issue of economy.

Since liberation, our country has achieved great successes in all aspects. National industrial and agricultural production has not only been restored but also greatly developed. However, we must admit that our country is still an economically backward country. To build a prosperous and happy socialist country on such a backward foundation, we must go through a long period of hard struggle. We must carry out economic construction on an unprecedented scale and at a rapid pace, concentrate the main forces of the state on important construction, and use the state's funds reasonably to make every penny play its maximum role. However, it should be seen that there are still quite serious waste and irrational phenomena in our enterprises and government departments.

Here, I would like to mention some materials at hand:

In the field of basic construction, over the past few years, we have made significant achievements in improving project quality and eliminating waste; but due to the large scale of construction, complex technology, rapid progress requirements, and the fact that many equipment and materials are imported from abroad, while our subjective strength and experience are very insufficient, coupled with problems in work, there are still phenomena of idle workers, material accumulation, rework, using large materials for small purposes, using good materials for inferior purposes, and chaos on the construction site with no one taking responsibility. According to the incomplete statistics of the Bank of Communications in May this year, the accumulated materials in basic construction nationwide, excluding those already adjusted and handled, still amount to 259,190 billion yuan, obviously a large part of which is avoidable accumulation. According to the estimates of the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering, due to the blind expansion of plans by various places, exceeding the needs of the project, or due to poor planning, stopping work for materials, stopping work for drawings, the expenditure on training surplus workers and idle work this year is estimated to be about 320 billion yuan, which is even larger than last year's figure. Some enterprises do not rely on improving labor productivity and saving raw materials to reduce costs, but rely on increasing project budgets and overestimating contract prices to obtain profits. Some key projects think that the state will definitely guarantee key construction, so they spend money recklessly without concern. Some basic construction units have material reserves far exceeding the needs, and the construction site has no one taking responsibility. A construction unit even posted a notice saying "No management, everyone takes what they need," leaving the door open for anyone to take. The Central Ministry of Fuel Industry inspected the Taoyuan 360 site this year and found that the labor efficiency was shockingly low. At the lowest point of efficiency, the efficiency of steel bar workers and formwork workers only reached 15% of the quota, the working efficiency of concrete workers only reached 2% of the quota, and the efficiency of bricklayers even only reached 1/20 of the quota. There were many management personnel, but things were done poorly. The loss and waste of tools and supplies were also very serious. Workers reflected: "Taoyuan 360, many people, much money, gold paved the ground."

In the field of state-owned commerce, although management has improved year by year, the proportion of commercial turnover costs is still very high, reaching 13.57% of the total sales in 1953, which is definitely reducible. At the same time, due to insufficient understanding of the supply and demand situation, there are shortcomings in management, resulting in the allocation of goods often sending goods suitable for area A to area B, sending goods suitable for urban areas to rural areas, and untimely allocation of seasonal goods, leading to winter goods arriving in summer and summer goods arriving in winter, causing capital accumulation and increasing round-trip transportation costs. For example, last winter, within one quarter, 100,000 pigs were transported from Henan to Guangzhou, due to blind demand and blind procurement and transportation, resulting in a shocking number of pig deaths. A total of 4,053 pigs died before transportation, 5,509 pigs died during transportation and before handover at the destination, and 4,184 pigs died after acceptance by the other party, causing a loss of tens of billions of state property and creating a bad influence. Of course, we lack cold storage warehouses and refrigerated vehicles, so we have to concentrate a large number of live pigs for long-distance transportation, which is also a cause of death. In the storage and management of goods, some places, due to insufficient vigilance, poor defense, and incomplete fire-fighting equipment, once an accident occurs, the loss is great. A large number of machinery and equipment are poorly managed and damaged.

In the field of grain transportation and storage, there are also many problems. Concentrating a large amount of grain for management and allocating it to places in need is a huge and complex task. Under the current situation of grain imbalance in variety and region, it is necessary to adjust and allocate grain on a national scale, and it is inevitable to increase some transportation costs. But in some places, a lot of effort was spent to transport grain out, only to find that the place did not have enough grain to supply, and had to spend even the same amount as the grain price to transport grain from other places. In many places, due to the lack of strict inspection during the warehouse acceptance, high moisture content, and no drying, the stored grain in the warehouse became hot and deteriorated, and some even rotted. The general loss of grain is also very large. Many avoidable losses have not been avoided.

In general government agencies and enterprises and institutions, the phenomenon of large organizations, many levels, many redundant personnel, and low efficiency has not been completely overcome. The phenomenon of pursuing luxury and grandeur, pursuing pomp, and spending money recklessly still exists and is not individual.

The above examples are just a few from my hand. There are still many similar phenomena. These shortcomings, although there are many specific objective reasons, are also some that are difficult to completely avoid in the process of work development, but if we strengthen work comprehensively and seriously, pay attention to economy, and if we do a good job in financial work and financial supervision, many of them can be avoided. The state strives to reduce all possible expenditures and invest a large amount of funds in economic construction; the farmers of the whole country and the broad masses of the people save clothes and food, pay taxes, and buy national bonds to support the economic construction of the state. This money is not easy to come by. If we do not take it seriously and allow it to be wasted, can this be tolerated? Many of our comrades, after managing the financial and economic work of the state, have big eyes, and figures of tens of billions or hundreds of billions seem to be nothing. But how much is ten billion? It is equivalent to nearly ten thousand metric tons of grain, equivalent to the annual income of 500 to 800 peasant households in poor areas. Can this number be said to be small? Some comrades are satisfied with some achievements in work, forgive their own shortcomings, and often say: "Achievements are the main thing, shortcomings are inevitable, waste and loss are possible, as long as the work is completed, it is worthwhile." This attitude is not responsible to the state and is incorrect. No one can deny that in the past few years, our achievements are the main thing, our shortcomings are the shortcomings of progress, and they have already been gradually overcome or are being overcome. However, we must not be complacent and relax our demands on ourselves because of this, allowing shortcomings to continue to exist.

In recent years, we have mobilized a large number of workers and state personnel to carry out various production and economy competitions in factories, mines, construction sites, shops, transportation, and vast rural areas, and have achieved great results, emerging many labor heroes and model figures. For example, in the textile industry, in the early days of liberation, the average cotton consumption per piece of yarn in Shanghai mills was 410 jin. Due to the promotion of advanced experience and the improvement of workers' awareness, the waste rate of cotton has been reduced year by year, and now the average cotton consumption per piece of yarn is only 395 jin. If all textile mills in the country calculate according to this, 60 to 70 billion yuan can be saved each year, which is enough to build two more textile mills with 50,000 spindles and more than 1,000 looms. The Ministry of Railways saved 161,700 tons of coal from January to September 1953, a reduction of 11.8% compared to the same period in 1952. These tons of coal can supply 100 trains to travel 4,000 kilometers. In 1953, the six industrial ministries under the Central Government responded to the Central Government's call for increased production and economy, creating an additional 300 billion yuan in profits for the state. The call for increased production and economy issued by the Central Government, through the efforts of various levels of party and government leadership and the broad masses of workers and all personnel, increased income and saved expenditures, playing a great role in reversing the then tight financial situation. Our country is large, with many construction projects, state agencies, state-owned enterprises, and institutions spread throughout the country, with a wide range of businesses. If we save a little everywhere, it will accumulate into a very considerable figure. For example, if the basic construction projects nationwide can reduce construction and installation costs by 8% according to the plan requirements, it can save tens of billions of state funds for the country; state-owned and local state-owned industries, if they complete the plan to reduce production costs, can also save tens of billions of state funds for the country; state-owned commerce and foreign trade departments, if they reduce management costs by 1% of the sales volume on the current level, they can save tens of billions of state funds for the country within a year. Here, I also think of, our country is so large, with so many people, if each person can save 10,000 yuan a year and deposit it in the bank or buy national bonds, the state can also increase tens of billions of funds that can be used. It can be seen that there are many places where savings can be made, and if work is tightened, a great contribution can be made to the construction of the state.

In our country, the funds for socialist industrialization cannot be like imperialism, relying on plundering colonies. This is a path that capitalist countries have taken, and we will not take this path. The only reliable way for socialist accumulation is internal accumulation, that is, to actively increase production, increase income, and expand socialist accumulation itself; at the same time, to practice economy strictly, tighten expenditures, and use every penny to the most necessary place, to the greatest extent to play the role of funds. Economy is an important source of socialist accumulation and a major method of socialist management. The economic construction of our country has two possibilities: one is to increase production, improve quality, reduce costs and commercial turnover costs, strengthen planning, and fully and exceedingly complete the state plan, so as to accelerate the pace of industrialization; the other is to manage poorly, waste a lot, affect the overall plan of the state, and delay the pace of industrialization. We should strive to avoid the latter possibility and strive to realize the former possibility.

We require all state-owned enterprises to gradually improve the management level of enterprises, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, improve labor productivity, reduce costs and commercial turnover costs, and accelerate the turnover of funds; require the state financial system and various financial management units to strengthen financial management, strengthen financial supervision, and strengthen financial discipline; require state personnel and all workers to save the financial and material strength of the state, oppose extravagance, oppose waste, and firmly fight against all phenomena that violate financial discipline and steal state property; require the people of the whole country to practice economy strictly, advocate savings, and expand their own production. We believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, as long as the people of the whole country cooperate with the government, we will surely further implement increased production and economy, and ensure the smooth progress of the socialist industrialization of the state.

In the past, we did not fulfill our supervisory and inspection responsibilities in financial work, and financial supervision work was not seriously established. We are also responsible for the above-mentioned shortcomings.

**Speech by Li Shuzhen**

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I am very excited after listening to Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report at the conference. The great achievements of our country in the past five years, especially the rapid progress in economic construction, have made the socialist economic component in the national economy continuously increase in proportion, strengthen its leading role, and prepare the material foundation for the realization of socialist transformation, thereby ensuring the continuous improvement of the material and cultural living standards of the people. This is a very inspiring thing. I, as a representative of Tianjin, support Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report and propose that the conference adopt this report.

Although I hold a position in the government, my main work is still facing the business community. Premier Zhou Enlai's report instructs us that in the economic construction of the state, the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is also an important task, and I feel a heavy responsibility. Since the announcement of the general line and general tasks of the transitional period of the state, most private industrialists and businessmen have, after learning, accepted socialist transformation and voluntarily taken the path of state capitalism. However, there are still quite a few stubborn and hesitant ones. Therefore, I would like to say a few words to private industrialists and businessmen nationwide and make a few suggestions to the people's government:

First, industrialists and businessmen should understand the future of social development. Currently, our country is gradually transitioning to a socialist society. This is an inevitable trend of social development, which is not subject to human will and is irresistible. Private industrialists and businessmen can only have a bright future by following this direction. This is the clearest thing.

Second, the state adopts the policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce, and encourages and guides them to transform into various forms of state capitalist economy, gradually replacing capitalist ownership with public ownership. This correct policy has been effective in recent years and is now fixed in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. Private industrialists and businessmen can only follow this specific path to better realize the transformation of enterprises and individuals. This is also the clearest thing.

Third, the facts of the past few years have vividly proved that after capitalist enterprises enter into joint state-private operations, due to the change in production relations, the entry of enterprise production into the state planning track, and the improvement of enterprise management, production has increased rapidly, the working conditions and material life of workers have improved accordingly, and profits have also increased; capitalists and representatives of the capitalists, due to the constant direct leadership, education, and assistance of the public representatives and the supervision of the working masses, are more likely to combine enterprise transformation with personal transformation. On the job, as long as you can perform your duties, you will definitely have a position and power; as long as you can study hard, you will definitely be transformed well. When entering a socialist society, if you can master new production technology and new management methods, and serve the people honestly and loyally, the state will definitely give you an appropriate arrangement and obtain corresponding remuneration according to your contribution. At that time, although classes will be eliminated, these individual capitalists will have transformed into laborers and can live a happy and prosperous life with the laboring people of the whole country. This is also the clearest thing. So I think that any private industrialist and businessman should no longer have any doubts about this path of socialist transformation, no longer have any hesitation and waiting, and quickly clear their minds and accept the transformation honestly.

Fourth, in the past year, all members of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce have received a patriotic and law-abiding education, and it can be said that there have been some achievements. But some members say that "patriotism is easy, but law-abiding is difficult," or "there is no law to abide by." These statements have been corrected accordingly. After the draft Constitution was published, many private industrialists and businessmen saw that the draft Constitution Article 10 stipulates that "the state protects the ownership of production materials and other capital ownership of capitalists according to law," Article 11 stipulates that "the state protects the legal income, savings, housing, and various living materials of citizens," and Article 12 stipulates that "the state protects the inheritance right of citizens' private property according to law," and they were very happy. This is understandable. However, because these articles are beneficial to them, they greatly stimulated their selfishness and began to find loopholes. According to the reflections of members of the Democratic National Construction Association and the Federation of Industry and Commerce in various places, many private industrialists and businessmen have tried to withdraw funds, buy living materials, or have big feasts, thus consuming useful capital. This is a despicable phenomenon—moreover, such a way of finding loopholes in the Constitution is an expression of resistance, which greatly violates the spirit of the Constitution and is not allowed by the people of the whole country. Such private industrialists and businessmen should be advised to be honest and cherish their capital, only by using it to expand construction and increase production, do good things for the people, and the people will not forget them. Moreover, the Constitution also has Articles 13 and 14, and illegal acts will definitely be stopped. Therefore, I solemnly warn here.

However, looking at the current situation, many large private industries in major cities have already taken the path of high-level state capitalism, and the middle-level forms of processing and ordering have already accounted for a large proportion. In Tianjin, there were 23 public-private joint ventures in 1953, and 61 are planned to be developed in 1954. Necessary preparations have also been made for some factories that need and are possible to implement public-private joint ventures. In 1953, the state's processing, ordering, packaging, and purchasing for private factories accounted for 65.47% of the total industrial output value of private industry, and this proportion has increased to more than 80% in the first half of 1954.

In the field of private commerce, grain, oil, and cloth have been transformed in the overall scale of the industry, and personnel have been properly arranged. Many other private retailers have also established business relationships with state-owned commerce and entered the state plan. This is a great and profound change that is happening in the real life of our country, which is a welcome phenomenon, and capitalists should not fear and avoid this. As far as I know, there are still a few problems in the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, which are put forward for reference by relevant state administrative departments: (1) In the transformation of private commerce, some industries need money but not people, and some commerce has money and people, and people have to be transferred together, which makes it difficult for both sides to reach an agreement, and industries cannot absorb funds and develop; commerce has nothing to do and sits eating up the savings. This problem needs to be solved urgently by relevant government departments and local Democratic National Construction Associations and Federation of Industry and Commerce. (2) Many small and medium-sized factories play a certain role in complementing national construction; but due to dispersion and backwardness, they do not have the conditions for public-private joint ventures, and their potential cannot be fully utilized. I hope the government can encourage and guide them as much as possible, and make those factories that are interdependent in production processes organize together, so as to take the path of public-private joint ventures. Only in this way can the role of existing enterprises be fully utilized to better serve national construction and the needs of the people. Stalin once said in the summary of the first five-year plan: "It is much more difficult to master new enterprises and new technologies than to use those old factories or renovated factories that are already familiar with the technology." This is a precious experience we should learn from. (3) Public-private joint ventures in industry have accumulated a lot of experience in recent years, and the government has also promulgated the Interim Regulations on Public-Private Joint Venture Industrial Enterprises this year. In the future, the number of private enterprises applying for public-private joint ventures will definitely increase. I hope the government will cultivate and train cadres in advance to be assigned, which is also a key issue that needs attention.

As for private industrialists and businessmen who commit the "five poisons," they should be strictly corrected. However, I feel that the method of correction can make full use of the inspection of government agencies, the leadership of state-owned enterprises, and the supervision of the working masses, to expose and report in time, to handle and announce in time, so that lawbreakers can repent, and laggards dare not try, and at the same time, it will not affect the enthusiasm of patriotic and law-abiding industrialists and businessmen who engage in legitimate business. Private industrialists and businessmen have their class essence of evil roots, and they need a long period of patient guidance and help in the process of transformation.

Fellow representatives, the economic policy of our country to transform capitalist industry and commerce in a peaceful transitional manner is completely in line with the actual situation of our country. Government agencies and state-owned enterprises, capitalist industrialists and businessmen, should all do a good job in this task of transforming capitalist industry and commerce into socialism. Let us industrialists and businessmen raise the banner of socialist transformation and march forward with big strides!

**Speech by Chen Yongkang**

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I listened to Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report and fully support it.

Nearly four million ethnic minorities in Guizhou lived a life of oppression and hardship before liberation. In the winter of 1949, the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao liberated Guizhou, and we became the masters of a new society and a new country. In the early days of liberation, we ethnic minorities actively assisted the Liberation Army in eliminating bandits throughout the province; later, we actively participated in the movements to eliminate bandits, suppress counter-revolutionaries, and aid Korea; we also assisted the government in eliminating the opium that the imperialists and the Kuomintang had used to poison the people of Guizhou for many years.

With the victory of bandit elimination and anti-bandit suppression, based on the urgent demands of the ethnic minorities, land reform was carried out in the ethnic minority areas. During the land reform, each person received about 600 jin of land. From then on, we forever got rid of the miserable days of "crows without tree stumps, Miao people without land, teenage girls without clothes." The political awareness and production enthusiasm of the ethnic minorities have been greatly improved. In recent years, with the strong support of the government, we have increased production every year, truly achieving land reform plus a bumper harvest, with surplus grain every year, and our lives have improved significantly. The miserable life of many people eating ferns and not being able to wear clothes or eat salt before liberation has gone forever. Now, each of us can eat grain, and in 1953, the average person could eat more than 8 jin of salt and wear more than 1.3 meters of cloth per year.

Based on the voluntary principle of the masses and considering ethnic characteristics, mutual aid and cooperation movements have been gradually carried out among the ethnic minorities, and 64 agricultural production cooperatives have been organized. In recent years, the People's Government has issued agricultural loans totaling more than 11.6 billion yuan in ethnic minority areas, helped ethnic minorities build small and medium-sized water conservancy projects, improved farming techniques, and issued interest-free agricultural tool loans totaling 13.8 billion yuan. The backward production conditions of high-altitude areas such as "chasing mountains to eat" and "broad sowing and thin harvest" have gradually improved.

At the same time, the Communist Party of China and the People's Government have helped us implement regional autonomy. Now, six counties, nine districts, and three townships of ethnic autonomous areas have been established, and more than 7,000 ethnic cadres who have left production have participated in the work of various government departments, making us truly the masters of the country. The trade, education, and health work in ethnic minority areas have also developed significantly. Ethnic trade stores have been established in 25 counties, and ethnic trade groups and ethnic trade small groups have been set up in many districts and townships. Local specialties such as the bananas of the Buyi Autonomous Region in Luodian County, which were once fed to pigs, are now in short supply. The province has established one ethnic college, 12 ethnic middle schools, one normal school, and more than 174,000 ethnic minority students in primary and secondary schools. The situation where ethnic minorities were deprived of the right to education in the past has fundamentally changed. In ethnic minority areas, 196 health and medical institutions have been established, and health work has been carried out, reducing diseases significantly, such as the basic elimination of malaria in Luodian and other counties.

In the past four years, under the correct leadership of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao, the achievements of various work in our ethnic minority areas are great. We ethnic minorities in Guizhou have achieved political equality, and our material and cultural lives have improved significantly.

In addition, we feel that the past regulation of timber prices had large regional price differences and was not reasonable, and we request the Central Government to unify the regulation of timber prices to maintain the reasonable income of farmers in timber areas. Some autonomous county governments do not pay enough attention to ethnic characteristics and do not fully play the role of ethnic cadres, which should be improved.

We ethnic minorities deeply feel that only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can we achieve national equality and advance to a socialist society. Today, the Constitution also guarantees the various rights of ethnic minorities, making us feel even more the great unity and warmth of our unified and multi-ethnic great motherland!

We will seriously implement Premier Zhou Enlai's work report, produce more grain to support national industrialization and the liberation of Taiwan. We will not rest until Taiwan is liberated.

**Speech by Li Siguang**

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report.

Under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government, and with the care of Chairman Mao, and the efforts of all geologists, the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, and the strong support of the people of the whole country, our country's geological exploration work has developed rapidly in the past five years.

In the early days of liberation, the main task was to take over and organize the old geological institutions and appropriately concentrate the geologists of the whole country. After the establishment of the Geological Work Planning Committee in 1950, based on the adjustment of the national geological institutions, planned mineral exploration and geological surveys began. After the formal establishment of the Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government in September 1952, according to the Central Government's instruction of "great development and great transformation," a large number of cadres were mobilized, a large number of equipment were increased, and large-scale mineral exploration and general surveys were rapidly developed with key points, to meet the glorious tasks that the geological department should undertake in the first five-year plan of the state.

Through these years of efforts, we have initially explored the reserves of several major minerals nationwide, preliminarily ensuring the needs of the first five-year plan of the state; at the same time, the geological exploration team has been rapidly expanded.

In the Central South region, the iron ore reserves we have explored have exceeded the past estimated amount by nearly twice; in a large iron ore area in the Northwest region, we have confirmed that its reserves have reached dozens of times the past estimated amount. The discovery of new coalfields and the expansion of old coalfields can, according to preliminary estimates, basically meet the needs of the new industrial bases and railway transportation established in the first five-year plan of the state.

We have also discovered a new giant copper mine; the old copper mine areas in various places in the country have also expanded compared to the past. Regarding lead, zinc, tin, tungsten, manganese, aluminum, and other important metal raw materials, appropriate mine areas have been found, and key explorations are being carried out separately; the production areas of chromium, nickel, cadmium, cerium, tantalum, beryllium, mercury, and platinum, which are precious raw materials for industry, have also been successively discovered.

The "geological heritage" of old China is limited. Until the liberation period, there were only about 100 people nationwide who actually engaged in geological surveys and research work. After liberation, we trained geological cadres in various ways. Now, just taking the Central Ministry of Geology as an example, our entire geological workforce, including drilling, pit exploration, geophysical exploration, chemical analysis, and surveying personnel, has increased by more than 90 times compared to the comprehensive geological exploration force before liberation. Now, we are still training more new forces in the two geological colleges in Beijing and Changchun, and the six geological middle schools in Xi'an, Chongqing, Wuhan, Nanjing, Changchun, and Xuanhua, as well as several geological departments in comprehensive universities. In response to the increase in personnel, equipment has also been greatly increased.

As mentioned above, our work has achieved certain results, but there are still many shortcomings in our work.

Fellow representatives, we must firmly remember Chairman Mao's instruction: "Avoid any boasting and arrogance." I believe everyone will fully agree with the spirit of the speeches by Comrade Chen Yi and other representatives, and deal with the shortcomings and mistakes in our work with a responsible attitude. In my own field of work, there are the following serious problems:

First, our comprehensive understanding of geological work is not enough, and the development of various aspects is often unbalanced. For example, in terms of exploring minerals and quantities, although iron and coal can basically meet the needs of the first five-year plan of the state, the supply problem of various rock and mineral raw materials needed for metallurgy, machinery, electricity, chemical industry, and construction has not been completely solved. Although we have correctly deployed key explorations to meet the urgent needs of heavy industry construction at present, and have initially carried out general surveys to search for reserve production areas, we have done too little for the requirements of agricultural technology transformation, such as phosphate and potash, and underground water exploration. The number of technical personnel in various professional departments is generally not in the necessary proportion. The weakness of engineering geology and hydrogeology has always been the biggest difficulty in our comprehensive promotion of geological work. These situations sometimes cause certain enterprise units to have partial work disconnection and idle work, and even serious errors of not following the normal exploration and construction procedures.

Second, the connection between various geological work departments is not enough. The work of mutual assistance between departments is not enough, so the limited manpower and material resources cannot be combined to be used effectively, and there is also little exchange of experience, and even the valuable data obtained through national investment and a large amount of labor, due to the imperfect registration, preservation, and use system, has not been fully utilized.

Third, in learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, especially in learning work norms and operation procedures, we have made great achievements in the past two years; but due to the short learning period and the original low technical level, the learning is not thorough, so we still cannot deeply grasp the spirit of advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union, and at the same time, combine it with the actual situation of our country, timely discover and solve problems. Some workers often rely solely on Soviet experts and cannot actively use the advanced experience of the Soviet Union to summarize their own work experience and create their own achievements.

Fourth, due to rushing to complete tasks, there is a phenomenon of pursuing quantity and neglecting quality in some of our work. This is particularly evident in drilling work, such as only paying attention to the footage and neglecting the core recovery rate. There are similar phenomena in chemical analysis, surveying, and geological general surveys.

The reasons for the occurrence of these shortcomings are undoubtedly related to our large tasks, small forces, and insufficient work experience; but more importantly, they are related to the subjectivism, bureaucratism, and dogmatism that exist in the planning and execution of plans by the various levels of leadership of the Ministry of Geology. The planning of our work lacks planning, and there is often a lack of foresight in our planning work. This is mainly because we have not yet fully mastered the work quotas determined by modern scientific and technological conditions; at the same time, we have not fully understood the geological situation and the laws of the occurrence of various minerals. Only by combining production practice and carrying out scientific research in depth can we gradually improve our technical level and strengthen the planning of our work.

Today, with the concerted efforts of all geologists nationwide and the strong support of the people of the whole country, under the banner of Chairman Mao, we firmly believe that the above-mentioned difficulties can be overcome. In the great cause of socialist industrialization and socialist transformation of our motherland, the glorious tasks undertaken by the geological department will surely be completed. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, we also firmly believe that all geologists of the country will unite with scientific workers of other departments, combine the requirements of their own business, study Marxism-Leninism and the works of Mao Zedong, to quickly improve our socialist consciousness and scientific and technological level, create the necessary material conditions, to ensure the final completion of the sacred task of liberating our motherland, eliminating the remaining Kuomintang traitorous clique, and liberating Taiwan, this great historical task.

Long live the Communist Party of China, the core force that always leads the Chinese people to victory on the road to brightness and happiness!

Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people!

**Speech by Deng Baoshan**

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report.

The great achievements of our country in various aspects in the past five years have vividly demonstrated the superiority of the people's democratic system. Before liberation, Gansu was described by three words: "chaos, drought, and poverty." In the long years of reactionary rule, due to the ruthless exploitation of the ruling class, the serious estrangement between ethnic groups, and the continuous invasion of natural disasters, the ethnic peoples of Gansu were dragged to the brink of despair. Since liberation, in just five years, the situation in Gansu has undergone fundamental changes. The ethnic peoples have established a new relationship of friendship and mutual assistance on the basis of equality. In 1953, the people of Gansu overcame a severe drought for the first time in history with their own strength. Industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry have developed significantly. The socialist component in the national economy has steadily increased. In the total value of modern industry and workshop handicrafts in the province, the proportion of state-owned, cooperative, and joint state-private enterprises has reached 77.35% by 1953. The number of peasant households participating in agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation organizations has reached 52.38% of the total number of peasant households by the spring plowing of this year. Based on the development of production, the living standards of the ethnic peoples have improved. This is the result of the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, and the joint efforts of the ethnic peoples.

However, looking at the current situation in Gansu, it is still relatively backward in economy and culture. To fundamentally change this situation, it is still a long and arduous task. Therefore, in the future, we must better unite the ethnic peoples and make more and more arduous efforts.

To do a good job in Gansu's future work, we must always pay attention to preventing and overcoming the shortcomings and mistakes that may occur in our work.

In the past five years, there have been many shortcomings and mistakes in our work. The main ones are that we do not understand the situation below well enough, and we do not deeply understand the characteristics of Gansu. Therefore, in some measures, we have not been able to take good care of the actual situation of various ethnic groups and regions. It is particularly worth noting that: some cadres, after achieving some results in their work, have developed a sense of pride and self-satisfaction, resulting in some work suffering unnecessary losses. The occurrence of these shortcomings and mistakes is undoubtedly related to many aspects, but it is inseparable from the shortcomings in our leadership work. Taking myself as an example, after participating in government work, I once had the mentality of being a guest, and some opinions that should have been raised were not raised in a timely and frank manner. Regarding study, especially the study of various policies of the Central Government, I did not grasp it tightly. This shows that at that time, I did not have a good understanding of my responsibility to the people's cause. My shortcomings have been improved to some extent in the past few years under the care and help of the Communist Party of China, but I should continue to work hard to overcome them in the future and ensure that I do a better job to respond to the trust and entrustment of the people.

Fellow representatives, I fully believe that under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and our great leader Chairman Mao, and under the guidance of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, as long as we study diligently, work hard, remain humble and modest, correctly carry out criticism and self-criticism, and maintain close contact with the masses, we will surely build our motherland into a great socialist state.

**Speech by Zhang Yun**

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with and enthusiastically support Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report. In this report, on the one hand, we see the great efforts made by the government in social reform, the restoration and development of the national economy, the improvement of people's material and cultural lives, and other work, and the brilliant achievements thereby obtained; on the other hand, we also see the government's firm spirit and great victory in implementing a peaceful foreign policy. Facing the thriving new situation of our motherland and the increasingly improved international status, we feel limitless excitement.

I am a woman worker, and here I would like to express some opinions on the government's implementation of the policy of gender equality. Our government is the government of the Chinese people, and its glory shines on all the people, and its governance is for all the people. In the past five years, the government has taken many major measures to abolish the feudal system that binds women, guarantee gender equality, and protect the interests of mothers and children, in accordance with the provisions of the Common Program. It has fundamentally changed the status of women being enslaved and oppressed in old China, making Chinese women gradually obtain equal rights in politics, economy, culture, education, social life, and family life. As a result, it has greatly inspired women's love for the motherland, defense of the motherland, and construction of the motherland, and actively participated in the construction of the motherland, making women gradually become an important force in national construction. The common reflection of the broad masses of women is: recalling the past, they feel pain and regret; seeing today, they are happy and smiling; looking forward to the future, they are full of confidence. These facts fully prove that gender equality, free marriage, and the protection of mothers and children are not only beneficial to women and children but also an important part of social reform; at the same time, they are an important policy that cannot be lacking for mobilizing the masses to consciously participate in the construction of the motherland.

However, some government officials still have insufficient understanding and weak or incorrect implementation of the above policies stipulated in the Common Program. For example, in mobilizing the masses to implement policies and laws, women are often ignored, and the strength and role of women are underestimated, and they cannot always pay attention to mobilizing men and women together, resulting in the inability to fully mobilize women to support the government's policies. In the implementation of the Marriage Law, although great achievements have been made, some government officials have adopted an indifferent and cold attitude towards the Marriage Law, and the implementation of the Marriage Law is left to its own devices and is not promoted, and some officials even have light or heavy violations of the Marriage Law. Therefore, the instructions of the State Council on the regular propaganda and implementation of the Marriage Law have not been able to be universally implemented. In addition, in the field of preschool education and child care, some government departments have not paid due attention; some departments have not made appropriate arrangements based on reality, resulting in the inefficient use of manpower and materials, and the expected effects have not been achieved. The reasons for the above situations are mainly that some government officials still have the remnants of feudal thought of valuing men over women. Due to this thought, they cannot correctly understand the basic spirit and great significance of the policy of gender equality and the policy of protecting marriage, family, mother, and child, thus affecting their awareness and enthusiasm in implementing these policies. Some people are also because they have not studied the above policies enough, the implementation methods are not appropriate, and the experience is not enough. Therefore, I suggest that at all levels of government, while continuing to promote the policies of gender equality and free marriage, protection of mothers and children, strengthen the policy education of cadres, overcome the remnants of feudal thought, regularly and plannedly check the implementation of the above policies, continuously summarize experience, and improve work methods to achieve more brilliant achievements.

We, the All-China Women's Federation and women's federations at all levels, should, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, seriously examine our work, overcome shortcomings, and further mobilize the broad masses of women to respond to the joint declaration of various democratic parties and people's organizations to liberate Taiwan and Premier Zhou Enlai's call, to strive for the liberation of Taiwan, to build a prosperous and happy socialist society, and to struggle for the complete liberation of women.

**Speech by Wu De**

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report.

Since liberation, Tianjin, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government, and the efforts of all sectors and ethnic groups in the city, has achieved development in production, prosperity in the economy, and appropriate improvement in the material and cultural lives of the broad laboring people. In 1953, the total industrial output value of the city increased by 2.72 times compared to 1949, and the number of employees increased by 1.2 times; the total retail sales of the city increased by 1.3 times compared to 1950, and the socialist economy has rapidly grown, and capitalist industry and commerce have also been transformed to a certain extent. These have provided favorable conditions for further implementing the general tasks of the transitional period of the state.

In the past few years, the local industrial production of Tianjin has developed rapidly and has played a certain role in supporting national construction and meeting the needs of the people. However, due to our weak political and ideological leadership, weak planning and technical management, there are still shortcomings of low quality, high cost, few varieties, and many accidents. We are striving to overcome these shortcomings. At the same time, we feel that the central government's policy for the development of local industry is correct, but we also feel that the planning is not strict enough, and the full play of the existing equipment capacity is not paid enough attention to, resulting in some places blindly building new factories, while some original factories are in a state of stoppage or semi-stoppage. For example, the production of some new pharmaceutical, wire, and knitting factories in Tianjin has been greatly affected by this. I hope that the relevant departments of the Central Government will pay attention to this in the future.

In the past few years, Tianjin has made initial achievements in transforming capitalist industry and commerce into socialism. In terms of the transformation of capitalist industry, as of now, the factories that have implemented public-private joint ventures (high-level form of state capitalism) account for 27% of the total industrial output value of private large-scale industry. After these enterprises entered into joint ventures, due to the change in production relations, production entered the state plan, and many new situations emerged, with significant increases in production, quality, and labor productivity, and a reduction in costs. At the same time, the original enterprise personnel have been properly arranged, and the capitalists have obtained reasonable profits, thus changing the passive and hesitant attitude of some capitalists towards public-private joint ventures. In addition, in the middle and low-level forms of state capitalism, the total value of processing, ordering, packaging, and purchasing for the state has reached 91% of the total industrial output value of private large-scale industry. The production of these enterprises that accept state processing, ordering, packaging, and purchasing has also entered the state plan to varying degrees, initially improved production management, and played a certain positive role. However, due to our insufficient understanding of the supply and demand situation in the market, the amount of processing and ordering is sometimes more and sometimes less, and there are still phenomena of high and low costs in cost calculation. These shortcomings need to be corrected. At the same time, there are still some capitalists who adopt a passive attitude towards processing and ordering, and even commit the "five poisons," which need to be strengthened in education, management, and stopped.

In terms of the transformation of capitalist commerce, due to the improvement of people's purchasing power, many commodities have appeared in short supply. According to the instructions of the Central Government, we have implemented the planned supply of food, oil, cloth, and other items, ensuring the basic needs of the people and maintaining market stability, which has been warmly supported by the masses. Due to the implementation of planned supply and the increase in state processing and ordering, the market has undergone fundamental changes. The organized market has rapidly expanded, and some private wholesale merchants have lost their role in the circulation link. Now we have adopted measures such as guiding them to enter industry, absorbing them as employees of state-owned companies, or transforming them into secondary wholesale and retail, etc., to arrange them; for the retail merchants of grain, oil, pork, beef and mutton, tea, cloth, etc., we have also implemented various forms of state capitalism, maintaining their continued operation on the one hand, and carrying out socialist transformation on the other.

In Tianjin, capitalist industry and commerce still account for a large proportion in the entire social economy. Therefore, the work of transforming capitalist industry and commerce into socialism in the future is still arduous. We are determined to continue to follow the active and steady policy, strengthen planning, continue to implement the policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming, improve vigilance, prevent the destructive activities of unscrupulous capitalists, and gradually complete the task of transforming capitalist industry and commerce into socialism.

We guarantee to the conference: to resolutely implement the various resolutions of the conference, to strive for the liberation of Taiwan, and to achieve the victory of socialist construction and socialist transformation.

**Speech by Zhang Nanshen**

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I sincerely support Premier Zhou Enlai's report!

Since liberation, I have been working in the Central South region for five years. In the past five years, the decisions of the government, the struggle of the cadres, and the achievements have been immeasurable; good news has come like snowflakes, and everything is unprecedented in history. I often cannot hide my excitement in my heart.

Our country has truly achieved great achievements, but at the same time, there are inevitably some shortcomings. In the past, whenever I encountered shortcomings in work, I always thought: the government's every measure is a shocking action, very difficult. Since the Communist Party and Chairman Mao have led the whole country to make our country so brilliant, I might as well not bother the government with some small problems, so when I encountered what I thought were shortcomings, some of them were "wanting to speak but hesitating." This way of thinking is definitely wrong. But some opinions, I have already discussed with the responsible comrades of the Communist Party inside the government, and they have often been accepted by them. Now, as a people's representative, I should be able to do "speak without reservation," even if it is a small problem, I will definitely reflect more to the government in the future. I think the government will, as in the past, sincerely welcome us to speak out, and we indeed have the responsibility to speak out.

The great achievements of our government in the past five years are the result of the great movements of land reform, resistance against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the "Three Antis" and "Five Antis," and ideological reform, etc. Without these great movements, our country would not have today's achievements. For example, if we did not carry out land reform, we could not imagine that the feudal landlord class could be eliminated; if we did not carry out resistance against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, we could not defend our homes and country; if we did not carry out the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, we could not consolidate the revolutionary order; if we did not carry out the "Three Antis" and "Five Antis," we could not eliminate the deeply rooted corruption and decadence in a short period of time, establish new morality, and repel the then rampant attack of the bourgeoisie. However, every movement of national scale cannot be said to have no shortcomings or errors. The Communist Party and the people's government, when grasping the movement, strive to avoid all possible errors and deviations, which is a good style of work that I have seen with my own eyes in the past few years, and it is a fact that everyone can see. However, in the movement, in the places where the grasp is not enough and the masses are not mobilized enough, it is inevitable that there are deviations due to subjective judgment or impure elements taking advantage of loopholes. These deviations, although they do not harm the main achievements of the movement, if not corrected, will make some masses dissatisfied with the government, and the cadres will not be educated. Our responsibility is to help the Party and the government reflect these extremely small errors and deviations, so that deviations can be minimized, so that the movement can be more thorough. Otherwise, it is inevitable that some problems will arise. If problems arise, we also have a certain responsibility.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 20th.

In recent years, I have often met with peasants from the countryside. From them, I have heard of many joyous events in the rural areas, such as rent reduction and deposit refunds, land reform, unified purchase and sale, and the development of agricultural mutual aid and cooperative organizations. These are all things that make the peasants extremely happy. However, there are some backward villages where things have not gone well, and some cadres have the habit of issuing compulsory orders. In some areas, the work has been done rather roughly. Some peasants often complain: there are too many meetings, too many tasks, and they can't handle it. For these peasants, I always comfort them by saying that starting a business is difficult, and when we build a socialist country, everyone will live a happy and fulfilling life. You must have patience. On the other hand, I also feel that in the future, we should pay attention to educating village cadres, changing the style of issuing compulsory orders, reducing meetings, and assigning tasks that do not affect peasant production. We should also pay special attention to some backward areas, guiding the peasants to socialism with great patience and caution.

I offer these unripe opinions for the guidance of all representatives.

Huang Changshui's Speech

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report. The report shows the achievements of the Chinese government and the Chinese people under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong. It has laid a solid foundation for China's transition to a socialist society and for the Chinese people to strive for a more fulfilling, happy, and joyful life in the future. I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support this report.

In contrast to the happy life of the people of our motherland, the situation of overseas Chinese is very difficult and challenging. Due to the impact of the capitalist economic crisis and the threat of the U.S. imperialist "blockade and embargo," the scope for overseas Chinese to make a living and find employment is increasingly shrinking. In addition, under the coercion and intimidation of U.S. imperialism, some governments have implemented policies to exclude Chinese, destroying Chinese industry and commerce. For example, the Philippine government recently issued the "Retail Business Filipino Law," banning Chinese from operating retail businesses, directly threatening the livelihood of 200,000 Chinese in the Philippines. The Thai government has announced that dozens of industries are not allowed to be operated by Chinese, causing Chinese industrialists and workers to face bankruptcy and unemployment. Therefore, Chinese industrialists and businessmen, seeing the prosperity and development of their motherland's economic construction, have already begun to actively participate in the industrial and agricultural construction of their motherland. Since liberation, overseas Chinese who have returned to China, especially those in the industrial and commercial sectors, have established five joint-venture enterprises under the correct leadership and active assistance of the people's government: the South China Enterprise Company, the Overseas Chinese Industrial Construction Company, the Guangzhou Investment Company, the Fujian Investment Company, and the New Overseas Hotel Limited Company. In addition, in various provinces and overseas Chinese areas, returned overseas Chinese have also participated in local handicraft and rural cooperative production, investment and reclamation, construction of housing, and establishment of schools, playing a certain role in rural construction. These are concrete expressions of overseas Chinese's love for their motherland and their sincere desire to participate in the construction of their motherland.

The state's socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, encouraging and guiding them to transform into various forms of state capitalist economy, gradually replacing private ownership with public ownership, is an important part of our overall task during the transitional period. This path is absolutely correct. However, due to the situation of overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen and other reasons, generally speaking, their speculative and profit-seeking attitudes are relatively serious. Therefore, it is fundamental to carry out a planned socialist transformation of returned overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen, making them voluntarily comply with state policies and laws, and not engage in illegal activities. However, considering that overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen cannot be transformed like domestic industrialists and businessmen, and even in the future when the motherland completely enters the socialist society, the situation of overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen may not change fundamentally, and returned overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen still maintain a thousand ties with overseas and are constantly influenced by overseas, therefore, the work of socialist transformation among returned overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen is very complex and requires special perseverance and patience to carry out. This is a characteristic of overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen. On the other hand, a small part of overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen may be deceived, misled, and softened by imperialism in the process of China's socialist transformation; however, due to the increasing oppression of imperialism on overseas Chinese, I believe that a considerable number of overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen will continue to support the motherland and support the motherland's transition to socialism, making the motherland a prosperous and powerful country. This is another characteristic. These explain that for returned overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen, on the one hand, we must resolutely implement socialist transformation and oppose any illegal activities; on the other hand, we need to consider the characteristics of overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen and provide them with necessary care. This requires a set of policies and measures for the socialist transformation of returned overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen. This is very necessary at present.

After the promulgation of the general line, overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen are concerned about how to carry out the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in the country, and how to handle the funds and means of production invested by overseas Chinese when the country enters the socialist society. They hope that the government will consider and take care of the special situation of overseas Chinese in the process of socialist transformation and even in the future when the socialist society is built, and whether there can be some differences in the treatment of overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen compared to domestic industrialists and businessmen under the premise that they must all accept socialist transformation.

Next, in recent years, many overseas Chinese who have returned to the country are small industrialists and businessmen, bringing back limited savings. They do not want to invest in private industry and commerce but hope to invest in joint-venture enterprises and also hope to participate in work, solving their own employment problems. This is also a common demand of returned overseas Chinese to solve their livelihood and future. Therefore, I suggest that all joint-venture enterprises with overseas Chinese participation should, as far as possible, take care of the wishes of investors and appropriately solve their employment problems. This way, we can widely absorb small investments, play an active role in accumulating funds, and also ensure that this part of returned overseas Chinese do not sit idle and consume their savings. This is a win-win situation.

Again, there are many in the overseas Chinese industrial and commercial circles who do not return but remit money back to invest. They hope to have a fixed dividend to support their relatives in the country, provide for their children's education, and prepare for their own return to the country in the future. In the early days of liberation, joint-venture enterprises with overseas Chinese participation all had fixed dividends in their articles of association, but currently, due to the different operating conditions of joint-venture enterprises, the implementation of this regulation also has some differences, and some places have even abolished fixed dividends, affecting the enthusiasm of some overseas Chinese investors. Of course, it is currently difficult to mechanically determine a fixed dividend; however, the method of completely abolishing fixed dividends is also worth considering carefully. I hope that the relevant departments will, within the principles of complying with state policies and laws and not harming state interests, give possible consideration to the requirements of overseas Chinese for guaranteeing dividends.

According to my understanding, Deng Zihui's speech means that overseas Chinese should be allowed to rent state-owned mountains and wasteland for agricultural and forestry operations, with a sufficient rental period. This opens up a new path for overseas Chinese investment and fully demonstrates the government's care for overseas Chinese. However, to further mobilize the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen to participate in the construction of the motherland, I suggest that the government should formulate specific measures for guiding overseas Chinese to invest in the country based on the long-term interests of the state and the special situation of overseas Chinese, and implement them.

Overseas Chinese's hometowns are mostly in mainland China. The Kuomintang bandits in Taiwan are trying to deceive the funds and foreign exchange of overseas Chinese in foreign countries to be used for their anti-national and anti-people purposes. The conspiracy of the Kuomintang bandits will not succeed. I believe that by adopting appropriate policies to take care of overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen, eliminating all concerns of overseas Chinese, we will definitely be able to smash the conspiracy of the Kuomintang bandits and win the support of all forces of overseas Chinese for the construction of the motherland.

In the past five years, the broad masses of returned overseas Chinese and their relatives have personally witnessed the great achievements of the construction of the motherland. The motherland has entered the period of socialist construction and socialist transformation, and this session of the National People's Congress has adopted the Constitution. I believe that all returned overseas Chinese, their relatives, and the 12 million overseas Chinese will enthusiastically support these great measures of the motherland.

Deng Zizhou's Speech

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report.

I am a doctor and also a health administrator. I would like to express some opinions on the issue of unity between traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine in health work.

As early as 1944, Chairman Mao Zedong called for the unity of traditional Chinese and Western medical workers at the Conference of Cultural and Educational Workers in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. After liberation, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China repeatedly instructed health administrative departments to pay attention to seriously uniting traditional Chinese medicine, absorbing traditional Chinese medicine to participate in the people's health work, and studying and developing all useful components of traditional Chinese medicine.

However, due to our health departments' various levels of leadership's incorrect understanding of traditional Chinese medicine in the past, the work of uniting traditional Chinese and Western medicine has not been done well. Traditional Chinese medicine has been discriminated against and marginalized in organization and academia for a long period after liberation, so some traditional Chinese medicine practitioners say: "After liberation, the people have been liberated, but traditional Chinese medicine has not." This situation has affected the work enthusiasm of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, making them unable to play their due medical role among the people. This responsibility should be borne by the leadership of our health departments at all levels.

Our country has a population of over 600 million, and the burden of medical and health work is heavy, while the subjective strength is small. Therefore, every medical worker should resolutely respond to the call of the Communist Party of China, do a good job of uniting traditional Chinese and Western medicine, and jointly meet the needs of the people and improve the people's physique. Therefore, I hope that our medical and health workers who have modern scientific knowledge will first extend their hands to learn the history of traditional Chinese medicine, study traditional Chinese medicine, and care about traditional Chinese medicine business. Of course, doing these jobs is not easy, but I think that health workers at all levels who are responsible for protecting the people's health and developing medical science have the obligation to require ourselves to do so.

Maybe someone will doubt the scientific nature of traditional Chinese medicine. Of course, traditional Chinese medicine has not developed into a systematic science, containing many parts that are in line with science, but also containing many unscientific dross. However, our task is not to absorb this dross but to absorb its essence, that is, the parts that are in line with science and have practical effects. To achieve this goal, arbitrary praise and criticism are not honest and responsible attitudes. Without investigation, there is no right to speak. We must unite scientists from all sides to cooperate, objectively and truthfully investigate and study, and make judgments based on the objective results of the investigation and study. Otherwise, failing to see the historical contributions of traditional Chinese medicine and traditional Chinese medicine, blindly criticizing traditional Chinese medicine, this attitude itself is unscientific.

For the health and well-being of all Chinese people, for the correct treatment of our national cultural heritage, and for the development and improvement of our medical science, all medical workers, whether administrative cadres or technical experts, must recognize the importance and correctness of the policy of uniting traditional Chinese and Western medicine from a ideological standpoint and implement it step by step. I hope that the Central Health Department will soon formulate specific measures in this regard.

Zhang Boqun's Speech

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report.

In the past five years, our water and road transportation industry, like other aspects, has achieved considerable results.

In the water transportation sector: At the time of national liberation, it had suffered severe damage and looting by the Kuomintang bandits. In recent years, we have carried out repair and new construction work. By the end of 1953, the tonnage of motorized transportation vessels in the country had increased by more than one fold compared to the end of 1949. The navigable mileage of inland rivers reached 95,000 kilometers, of which 30,000 kilometers are navigable by ships. The major ports along the coast and the Yangtze River and their auxiliary facilities have been largely restored. The repair of the Pukou Wharf, the repair of the No. 2 Wharf in Qingdao, the first phase of the expansion of the Huangpu Port, and the first phase of the reconstruction of the Tanggu New Port have been completed successively. The major inland and coastal trunk lines and major and medium-sized ports have also been successively unified in management, and the water transportation rules and regulations have been gradually unified. At the same time, the volume of water transportation has been increasing year by year. For example, the cargo volume of state-owned coastal, Yangtze River, and Songhua River transportation, with 1950 as 100, was 408% in 1953, and the cargo turnover volume was 961%.

With the growth of foreign trade, maritime transportation has also been gradually developed. Currently, there are 17 countries whose merchant ships are in communication with China. However, due to the harassment and sabotage of U.S. imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits, coastal and maritime transportation have been greatly obstructed. The Kuomintang bandits have seized merchant ships from China and 11 other countries in communication with China, totaling more than 70 ships. To develop China's foreign trade and maritime transportation, we firmly support the liberation of Taiwan!

In the road transportation sector: By the end of 1953, 40,000 kilometers of roads had been repaired and newly built, and the total mileage of roads in the country had reached 138,500 kilometers. Newly built roads are mostly in border and minority areas, including the Kangding-Lhasa, Qinghai-Tibet, Hainan, Kunlun, and Chengdu-Aba roads. The key roads that have been rebuilt include the roads from Xining to Yushu and from Shangrao to Fuzhou. These roads are of great importance for the development of the economy and culture of the Tibetan region and the western, southwestern, and coastal regions, for strengthening the ties between the peoples of various nationalities in China, and for consolidating the national defense of the motherland.

The newly built Kangding-Lhasa Road, from Ya'an to Lhasa, is 2,255 kilometers long, of which 1,567 kilometers from Maniganguo to Lhasa pass through 14 mountains with an altitude of 3,000 to 5,000 meters. Some sections have snow that never melts, and the road workers have to crawl in the clouds and snow line. There are more than 150 bridges built on the upper reaches of the Jinsha River and Lancang River, suspended on steep cliffs and raging rapids. All these obstacles could not stop the determination of our road construction workers, engineers, and laborers to "definitely build the road to Tibet." It is expected that the entire line will be completed by the end of this year.

In the past five years, local transportation has achieved some success under the leadership and support of local party and government authorities. The total number of operating vehicles in the country has been restored to the level before the war through extensive repairs and new additions, and has undertaken the increasing transportation tasks year by year. For example, the number of vehicles operated by local state-owned enterprises in 1953 increased by 75.89% compared to 1950, while the cargo volume increased by 514%, and the cargo turnover volume increased by 400%. In local transportation work, we rely on local manpower and financial resources, use local materials, carry forward the excellent tradition of the broad masses of laborers to build bridges and repair roads, organize laborers to maintain and repair roads, dredge inland waterways, repair bridges and ferries, and open up some roads that local people urgently need. For the scattered individual transportation industry of wooden sailboats and animal-drawn carts, we have carried out organizational management and reform. The above-mentioned work has played an important role in activating rural economy and primary markets.

We have carried out socialist transformation of the capitalist transportation industry. We have adopted the forms of joint state-private ownership and "unified loading, unified dispatch, and unified freight rates" to gradually bring the private transportation industry into the orbit of state planning. Coastal and Yangtze River private shipping have all been jointly owned by the state and private enterprises. Since the implementation of joint state-private ownership, the Min Sheng Shipping Company has undergone a series of reforms and improvements, increasing the load capacity of ships by 27%, building and renovating 15,000 tons of ships, and increasing the cargo volume by more than one fold. The cost of transportation on the Jian River has been reduced by 30%.

In the past five years, water and road transportation have achieved great success. This is inseparable from the leadership of the Communist Party of China, Chairman Mao Zedong, and various levels of party and government organs, the support of the people of the whole country, the help of Soviet experts, the efforts of all employees, and the leading role of a large number of labor models and advanced workers.

However, there are still many shortcomings and errors in our work. In transportation work, the most prominent shortcoming is high transportation costs and low efficiency. For example, the non-productive berthing time of ships is generally as high as 50% to 70%; the situation of empty and half-loaded ships is serious; ships that need repair cannot be repaired on time; the cost of port manual loading and unloading is high; the use of the limited mechanical equipment is insufficient; there is a lack of quota management; and the most important thing is that the idea of only asking for production without considering costs is still serious, as well as the conservative idea of using a wide range of resources and localism.

Another serious shortcoming in transportation work is: delays in transportation, frequent occurrence of cargo loss and errors. For example, there have been phenomena such as summer hats arriving in winter, grain spoilage, machine parts loss, and wrong delivery destinations. The most serious thing is maritime accidents, which have caused great political and economic losses. This is due to the serious bureaucratism of the leadership, neglecting the implementation of the unified policy of safe production, failing to establish a strict responsibility system, and lacking education for workers to follow operating procedures.

In basic construction work, due to the neglect of the leadership of surveying and design work, surveying and design lag behind construction, and the supply of materials and equipment is not timely, which has led to poor construction quality, waiting for materials, and a great waste of manpower and resources. At the same time, due to insufficient investigation and research on the situation of the whole country and the objective needs of development, insufficient study on how to properly use the limited investment of the state to save money and do more, there has been blindness in work.

Local transportation is closely related to the material and cultural life of the broad masses of people. It plays a major role in the transformation of agriculture and the improvement of agricultural productivity, as well as in the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. It is an indispensable part of the country's overall transportation system. In recent years, local people and the broad masses of people have been very concerned about the development of local transportation, urgently demanding the construction of roads, the dredging of waterways, and the increase of transportation tools. However, due to our existence of emphasizing main transportation and neglecting local and folk transportation, emphasizing modern transportation tools and neglecting backward transportation tools, neglecting the special role of various transportation, and lacking research on how to connect main transportation and short-distance transportation, summarizing and promoting experience is not enough; at the same time, due to the limited funds for local transportation in the period of key construction of the state, local transportation cannot meet the needs of the people. Especially on busy transportation routes, such as Lanzhou to Urumqi, Guiyang to Jinchengjiang, Shangrao to Fuzhou, due to the insufficient transportation capacity of trucks, goods and passengers are piled up waiting for transportation, and cargo owners and passengers are quite dissatisfied. At the same time, many specialized vehicles of government agencies and enterprises are idle and empty, which is a great waste of national resources. Some places have proposed that the transportation department should be responsible for organizing and managing the vehicles of government agencies and enterprises to make up for the lack of transportation capacity, which is good, but we have not yet studied and promoted it.

Our water transportation has rich natural water resources, with dense inland rivers that do not freeze all year round and a coastline of 12,000 kilometers. Due to the lack of construction of water transportation in the old China, the technology and equipment are very weak and backward; at the same time, due to our insufficient understanding of the status of water transportation in the transportation industry and the lack of understanding of how water transportation can save national investment, the natural water resources and water transportation of our country have not been well utilized.

The above-mentioned shortcomings and errors in work have been concentratedly reviewed and criticized at the national transportation conferences held last year and this year, and some specific measures have been taken, which are now being improved.

Chairman Mao Zedong often teaches us: Study the theory of economic construction diligently, study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union diligently, and study the business diligently to become an expert, avoiding mistakes. However, in the past few years, I have not studied deeply enough; I have not grasped and solved the key business problems; I have lacked a deep understanding and research of the work situation below, and I have not checked and supervised enough; therefore, there have been many errors and losses in my work, which is a failure to the country, the people, and Chairman Mao Zedong's trust.

We fully believe that with the planned development of China's national economy, especially the construction of heavy industry, shipbuilding, automobile manufacturing, and the petroleum industry, the continuous expansion of road construction, and the gradual improvement of port facilities and inland waterways, coupled with the enthusiasm and strong support of the people in various places for the transportation industry, relying on all employees to continue to work hard, carry forward achievements, overcome shortcomings, and correct errors, we can expect that China's water and road transportation will definitely achieve new development and greater achievements, gradually improve the backward situation of China's water and road transportation, better meet the needs of industrial and agricultural production, commodity circulation, and the material and cultural life of the people and national defense construction, and serve the realization of the overall task of the transitional period of the state.

Sao Jingban's Speech

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I am a representative of the Dai people from the border province of Yunnan. I feel extremely honored to be able to represent the Dai people to participate in the first session of the First National People's Congress!

I fully support Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report. In recent years, our Dai region, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao Zedong, and with the active help of the People's Liberation Army and Han cadres, has eliminated the remnants of bandits within the region, established autonomous regions and autonomous organs, and realized the right of self-government for ethnic minorities. New relationships of unity and friendship have been established among ethnic groups and within ethnic groups. Therefore, the border of the motherland has never been so solid and stable. Due to the strong support of the higher-level people's government in developing production, the living conditions of various ethnic groups have begun to improve. Last year, the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture built the Great Yingjiang River dyke, saving 103 villages and more than 30,000 acres of rice fields from floods. Cultural education has also made remarkable progress. From 1950 to 1953, the number of primary schools in the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture increased from 15 to 115, and the number of students increased tenfold. Various ethnic groups have received free medical treatment and preventive injections, and diseases and deaths have been greatly reduced. Due to the construction of roads to the border by the people's government, the development of trade, and the completion of the road from Kunming to the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region, the sales volume of state-owned trade in the Xishuangbanna region in the first half of this year has reached more than 60 times the total of 1950 and 327.8% of the same period in 1953. The tea production this year is 5.5 times that of 1949. In the past, farmers had to use more than 12 catties of rice to exchange for 1 catty of salt, but now only 3 catties of rice are needed to exchange for 1 catty of salt.

In recent years, we have deeply felt that only under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, and with the help of the Han people, can we ethnic minorities be liberated, develop, and gradually transition to a happy and fulfilling socialist society.

Building a socialist society is the common goal and common interest of the people of all ethnic groups in China. Therefore, our Dai region should also, like the whole country, carry out socialist construction and socialist transformation. In the matter of socialist transformation, I fully agree with the principles and paths mentioned by Comrade Liu Shaoqi in his report on the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, and proceed according to the provisions of the Constitution and the wishes of the majority of the people and leaders connected with the people.

In our region, there are still some shortcomings at present, such as the autonomous government's insufficient emphasis on cultivating cadres of various ethnic minorities, insufficient emphasis on patriotic education for local ethnic cadres, helping them establish the idea of self-government and the spirit of learning from advanced ethnic groups and welcoming the help of advanced ethnic cadres, and insufficient emphasis on actively reflecting the situation to higher authorities and actively seeking the leadership and help of higher authorities. In addition, among the Han cadres who go to work in the border areas, the vast majority are active, responsible, and hardworking, serving the people of the border areas with all their heart and soul; but there are also a few who do not respect the authority of ethnic minority cadres, do not respect the customs and habits of ethnic minorities, and do not act according to the characteristics of ethnic minorities. These shortcomings are harmful to the full realization of autonomy and various kinds of work. In the past, we have repeatedly overcome these shortcomings, and I believe that in the future, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao Zedong, we will definitely be able to gradually overcome these shortcomings.

We are located in the southwestern border of the motherland. U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang bandits, are still trying to carry out their provocations and sabotage activities there. We must be vigilant and closely unite around the Communist Party, the people's government, and Chairman Mao Zedong, unite in the great family of the motherland, and strive for the consolidation of the national defense of the motherland, the support of the liberation of Taiwan, and the defense of the construction of our great socialist state!

Dian Hua's Speech

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report. In the past five years, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, our motherland's political, economic, and cultural construction has achieved tremendous achievements, and our international status has been rising day by day. Living and growing up in such a great era and a great country makes me feel an indescribable pride.

I am a young actor, but I am so fortunate. When I was a child, the glory of the Communist Party illuminated my backward hometown. I experienced the great people's revolutionary struggle in the People's Liberation Army and saw its victory. Now, socialism and communism are beckoning to me, and I will see their realization. The wheel of history is accelerating, enriching and enriching our lives, making my life equivalent to several lives of our ancestors, and its glory is something they could not even dream of.

I am nurtured and educated by the Party. I remember vividly that when the banner of the People's Liberation Army against Japan was flying in the Jin-Cha-Ji border area, I joined the children's team. On the day I stood guard, the Jin-Cha-Ji Anti-Japanese Drama Troupe came to our village to perform, and I admired their fighting, tense, and lively life. I enlisted in the army. From then on, I received the Party's direct nurturing and the great tempering of the people's revolutionary struggle. The Party educated me to love the people, and from the moving practice of the people's revolutionary struggle, I experienced the pain and joy of the working people, as well as their hard work, simplicity, and indomitable noble qualities. This sublime reason and emotion encouraged me to perform and create the great image of the Chinese people.

When I was ill, my comrades told me that I had been elected as a representative of the First National People's Congress. I was so excited. I, a child from a remote village, did some ordinary work and was elected as a representative of the First National People's Congress. I never dreamed of it. However, I finally calmed down. I live in the era of the people, and this is no longer a dream but a reality. If I have any small achievements, they are the glory of the Party and the glory of the people. The people love and cherish me, which is an encouragement to me. I am still immature, but I will not be discouraged. I will turn the people's encouragement into new courage and strength, and work hard in my acting career to sing the praises of the Communist Party and Mao Zedong, who are like the sun, and to express the people's firm will to struggle for socialism and their yearning for a happy life in socialism.

Of course, I also have my specific hopes. I hope that playwrights can create more works under the guidance of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policies, especially works that create the great image of new-type women in People's China, depicting their glorious struggles on the political, economic, and cultural revolutionary fronts, writing about their heroic and tenacious, patriotic, labor-loving, and socialist noble qualities, so that all Chinese women can truly liberate themselves from various backward ideas and become a great force in socialist construction. As a young actress nurtured and grown up in the era of the people, like all actresses, I am eager to be able to display my acting skills and improve my acting level. This is very natural and understandable.

The first session of the First National People's Congress is a milestone in the political life of the Chinese people. It will also be a milestone for the new upsurge in the economy and culture of our country. I wish our beloved motherland a strong national defense, a prosperous economy, and a flourishing culture.

Xiong Kewu's Speech

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I am thrilled to participate in this historic meeting. I am very satisfied with Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report and propose that the conference adopt this report.

The People's Republic of China has been established for only five years, but due to the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao Zedong, our country has undergone fundamental changes. I have participated in local administrative work in the Southwest and have felt this very deeply. Taking Sichuan as an example, it has always been the most stubborn feudal stronghold in the country. During the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek, feudal tyranny was added to fascist terror, making the whole of Sichuan a hell without daylight. After liberation, through a series of struggles such as eliminating bandits and suppressing landlords, I personally saw this feudal stronghold completely destroyed by the people. The Sichuan of the past was infested with bandits, and people could not live in peace. Today's Sichuan is "safe at night and no one picks up lost items on the road." In the past five years, the Southwest has also achieved brilliant achievements in national economic construction. Both industrial and agricultural production have exceeded the highest levels in history. Old industries have been restored and developed; new industries have emerged one after another, and many have already started production. Agricultural production is also increasing year by year. Due to good weather, the development of mutual aid and cooperation, and the improvement of farmers' production enthusiasm, Sichuan will have another bumper harvest this year. The government has called for an increase in production by 6%, which has already been completed. Sichuan farmers, in order to support the industrial construction of the state and the disaster-stricken areas outside the province, are now working hard to plant sweet potatoes and potatoes to ensure their own food, and to free up surplus grain to sell to the state. The achievements of the Southwest in transportation construction are also great: the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, which Sichuan people have longed for for more than 40 years, has been in operation for more than two years. The Baocheng Railway has reached Jiangyou, and the Chengdu-Kunming Railway is about to complete the survey. It is worth mentioning that the Kangding-Lhasa Highway, built from the roof of the world, will be open to Lhasa this year; the Kunlun Highway and the Chengdu-Aba Highway are also arduous projects from the interior to the border. The Kunlun Highway has been open to Yunjinghong, and the Chengdu-Aba Highway will be completed by the end of this year. These are of great importance for consolidating the national defense of the western border of the motherland and helping the economic and cultural construction of various brotherly nationalities.

However, in the past five years, the work of local governments in the Southwest also has shortcomings. From what I have seen in my work, the laws and policies issued by the central government are all correct. However, when some places implement them, they are sometimes a bit rough. For example, the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain is definitely correct; however, in the implementation process in the Southwest, some places are sometimes not quite in line with reality, buying less where they should buy more and buying more where they should buy less; similarly, when selling, they sell to those who should not buy and those who should buy cannot buy, thus causing some farmers to be dissatisfied. This is due to insufficient analysis of the situation before the event and unclear explanation of the policy. I hope that the government will strengthen the education of cadres and mass propaganda work in the future to ensure that correct policies are fully and correctly implemented.

In the past five years, the people of the Southwest, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the people's government, have achieved tremendous achievements; but for me personally, I feel very ashamed. Since I participated in the Xinhai Revolution and overthrew the Qing Dynasty, due to the lack of a clear revolutionary direction at that time, the army I led fought more than ten years of civil war in Sichuan. I thought this was in line with the political proposals of the Xinhai Revolution, but in fact, it brought disaster to the local people. After liberation, I took on important duties in the administrative work of the Southwest and was also responsible for the work of the democratic parties. This is a great honor for me. However, due to the influence of the old society, I did not study enough after liberation; therefore, in specific problems, theory and practice are not closely combined, and the leading role that I should play in the people's revolutionary cause is not well played. Due to the continuous education of the Communist Party and the help of the masses, through a long-term struggle between new and old ideas, my understanding has gradually improved, but this is still far from enough. Now, I am honored to be a representative of the National People's Congress. In the future, I will study hard under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the supervision of the masses, work hard, and strive to fulfill the duties of a people's representative.

The Constitution of the People's Republic of China has been promulgated. The Chinese people have this new weapon of struggle. In the future, we will definitely achieve greater and more numerous victories. We will firmly grasp this weapon and advance towards a prosperous and happy socialist society under the great banner of Mao Zedong.

Che Xiangqin's Speech

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report.

In the past few years, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao Zedong, our people have achieved brilliant achievements in various social reforms, the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and the restoration and development of the national economy. Education has also made significant progress and improvement. Taking the education in the Northeast as an example, according to the statistics of 1953, the whole region has more than 5.9 million primary school students and 430,000 middle school students, far exceeding the number of students in any period in the history of the Northeast. The proportion of workers and peasants' children in school has been increasing year by year. Now, in primary schools, they account for more than 80%, and in middle schools, they account for 73%. While developing, primary and middle schools have also carried out initial teaching reforms and political and ideological education. However, I think that our school education still has many shortcomings and errors, mainly that we do not pay enough attention to improving the quality of school education, and there is a tendency to rush and overreach. Since the Central People's Government proposed the policy of "consolidation, key development, quality improvement, and steady progress," although there has been some improvement, in terms of quality improvement, we have not yet achieved the desired progress, especially in primary and middle schools, where some teachers have low levels and low teaching effects, which is still a serious problem. At the same time, school education still has the phenomenon of neglecting labor education. Some people engaged in educational work still have outdated educational views, thinking that students going to school, only going to college is normal, and after graduating from middle and primary schools, engaging in labor or employment is considered a great pity and even dishonorable. The erroneous idea of "all trades are inferior, only reading is superior" still has a deep influence on the broad masses and many students. Therefore, some students, after graduation, because they cannot go to college, are dissatisfied with the government. This is mainly due to the neglect of labor education and the lack of planning in school construction.

At the beginning of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the health of students in various places was very poor, and the disease rate was high. This is the evil fruit left by the reactionary ruling class of the old society. Since Chairman Mao Zedong put forward the call to "develop physical education, enhance the people's physique" and "good body, good study, good work," schools, factories, troops, and government agencies have begun to pay attention to the development of physical education, thereby significantly improving the health of the broad masses, especially the broad youth. However, from the perspective of the Northeast, we have not fully implemented Chairman Mao Zedong's instructions and policies. Some schools, due to heavy coursework, affect students' health. In some middle and primary schools, some students suffer from neurasthenia, and some, in order to go to college, prepare for exams while taking medicine; some students, after graduation, due to poor physique, cannot work happily. This is indeed a serious phenomenon. In the development of physical education, the first shortcoming is the lack of attention and propaganda for physical education. Some cadres do not want to engage in physical education work, and even those who are learning physical education do not want to do this job. Secondly, at all levels of leadership, the mass line has not been seriously implemented, and many places lack regular promotion and guidance for the development of mass physical education, thus physical education has not been widely and deeply developed.

In terms of future school education and physical education, we should follow the provisions of Article 94 of the Constitution and the spirit of Premier Zhou's report, and cultivate young people into all-around builders and defenders of socialist society. In terms of school education work, we must further implement the policy of "consolidation, key development, quality improvement, and steady progress," strengthen the planning of school construction, oppose subjectivism and decentralization, and thoroughly overcome the tendency of blind development, especially pay attention to improving the quality of school education. First of all, we must greatly improve the quality of teachers. The education administration at all levels should not only plan to cultivate and improve the existing teachers but also strengthen the work of cultivating new teachers and uniting old teachers to meet the needs of work development. In all schools, we must strengthen political and ideological leadership, and in all courses and extracurricular activities, we must pay attention to the infiltration of socialist ideology, especially pay attention to the infiltration of labor education, and overcome the tendency to neglect labor education.

In terms of developing physical education, we must strengthen propaganda work, implement the mass line, strengthen and improve the organizational structure for leading physical education, overcome formalism, and truly implement the "Labor and Defense" system, and carry out Chairman Mao's instructions on "three goods" to all schools, factories, troops, government agencies, and the broad masses.

Mao Yisheng's Speech

Chairman, fellow representatives:

It is a great honor to be a representative of the happy people of the Mao Zedong era to participate in the National People's Congress. This is a great responsibility. We must show through our actual actions in the future how we have carefully completed our tasks at the congress and how we support the Constitution, trust the government, and love the leader.

I am a technical and scientific worker. I think our Constitution is a great scientific document. It is completely based on Chinese facts and follows the laws of social development, pointing out the path that the Chinese people should take. This is the concentrated expression of the wisdom of the Chinese people. This is the scientific attitude and scientific method, so our Constitution will definitely be thoroughly implemented and achieve the expected results. I also think that the work of our government in the past five years has achieved brilliant achievements in various aspects, which is inseparable from the spirit of seeking truth from facts and valuing science and technology. The most outstanding performance of the government's work is to strive to complete all predetermined plans and often exceed the planned targets. This is unprecedented in Chinese history. This is the manifestation of the superiority of the socialist political system, and socialism is built on the basis of highly developed technology. I fully agree with and support the reports of Comrade Liu Shaoqi and Premier Zhou Enlai. I am honored to participate in the constitutional work and to contribute all my technical skills in a government department. This is a great honor.

Here, I cannot help but recall the dark and chaotic situation before liberation. At that time, we technical and scientific workers were separated from the masses, often changed jobs, either to decorate the facade of the reactionary rule or to directly or indirectly serve imperialism. Looking back now, it is really shameful. However, as soon as China was liberated, in the face of new things, our political awareness was greatly improved. First, we studied Marxism-Leninism and the works of Mao Zedong, understanding that science belongs to the people and that scientific and technological work should serve the people. Secondly, in work, we gradually entered the masses, realizing that without the combination of different workers, nothing can be done. At the same time, we came into contact with the advanced science of the Soviet Union, which was a great enlightenment and also improved our scientific level. All these are the basic reasons why we can make contributions to the government's work. We can serve the people in this way and make progress every day because of the education and care of the Communist Party. Our gratitude to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong is increasing.

In the overall task of the state pointed out by the Constitution, we technical and scientific workers have a more important responsibility than before. We must work with the workers to transform the backward technology left over from old China into new and advanced technology to improve labor productivity and accelerate the socialist industrialization of the state. We must especially contribute more strength in the nationwide technological innovation movement. However, our past work is behind the requirements. The most obvious thing is that we have not done a good job in scientifically summarizing the reasonable suggestions and inventions of the working class, and we have not helped them much in theory. This is due to our lack of understanding of the site, insufficient unity with the workers, and insufficient mobilization of our collective strength. At the same time, in learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, we have not been able to grasp it well, and when combining it with reality, we sometimes feel at a loss. We must correct these shortcomings. This is the direction of our future subjective efforts.

In the past five years, due to our great victories in all aspects, the international status of the motherland has been unprecedentedly improved. However, our scientific status, although it has been rapidly developed under the impetus of economic construction, is still far behind. Just when the state is implementing the overall task, science is a weak link. This is a serious problem. Now, colleges and universities are developing vigorously in various places, and scientific and technological talents will definitely increase greatly in a few years, but it will still not be able to meet the needs. We must fully mobilize all potential forces to strengthen scientific work and improve the technological foundation to build a socialist state with 600 million people. This is an extremely difficult and great task. We must fully mobilize all potential forces to strengthen scientific work and improve the technological foundation.

Now, I would like to put forward a few opinions for everyone's correction:

1. The training of technical personnel cannot rely solely on regular schools, especially in the next few years when the supply is insufficient. We should promote various forms of technical supplementary education in various production enterprises and generally improve the scientific and technological level of workers under the condition of not leaving production. Here, I would like to especially emphasize the importance of correspondence education; under the condition of lack of teachers and textbooks, this correspondence education method, which is distributed throughout the technical system of the whole country and goes from practice to theory, is very urgently needed.

2. In production and construction, there are many technical problems, so various scientific research and experimental institutions have been established one after another, which is a good phenomenon. However, due to the lack of overall planning and organization, there has already been the phenomenon of duplication and waste; while some urgently needed scientific work has no one to take responsibility. At present, when talents and equipment are both in short supply, how to improve this situation is worth considering. In recent years, various specialized academic societies have carried out a large number of academic activities, which have played a considerable role in scientific research. Here, there are two problems that are difficult to solve: first, the academic activities of the members of various societies, although all related to business, are still subject to restrictions on the time needed for activities from their work units; second, when members exchange experiences and discuss academic issues, they are linked to reality and encounter confidentiality issues, so they do not know how to handle it. These two points hope that the government will give specific regulations.

3. As a people's organization, the Science and Technology Popularization Association has developed greatly in the country in recent years. However, popular education needs the help of physical demonstrations. I hope that the central enterprises and departments will, after holding various exhibitions at home and abroad, transfer the technical exhibition items to the Popularization Association for sorting and preservation, making full use of them, and gradually establishing a permanent exhibition hall of science and technology.

4. The scientific work of the whole country, from scientific research to scientific popularization, needs a detailed plan to organize the scientific strength of production, education, and research in three aspects, link and exchange, divide labor and cooperate, and better serve production and construction. Our scientific work in the field of medicine and health, because it is in a national system, plus the mass patriotic hygiene movement, can make progress every day. The scientific work in industrial and mining enterprises also needs a national network to organize technical strength, promote technological achievements, and cooperate with the mass technological innovation movement. We can guarantee and promote the health of technology, just like guaranteeing and promoting the health of the human body.

Our great Constitution has been solemnly adopted. The provisions in it that the state encourages the initiative and creativity of citizens in labor, encourages and helps citizens to carry out scientific research, etc., will have an infinite driving force for the development of the scientific cause of the motherland. Under the great Constitution and under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, we technical and scientific workers will definitely work hard with the people of the whole country to learn hard, work hard, and strive for the socialist construction of the motherland, for the lofty goal of world peace and human progress!

Jiang Nanxiang's Speech

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with and support the government work report of Premier Zhou Enlai.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, all aspects of our work have achieved great achievements, which is recognized by the world. As a staff member of a university, I deeply feel that the higher education of new China, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government, is advancing at such a rapid pace.

During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, our higher education could not and did not aim to meet the actual needs of the people of the whole country. At that time, school education was detached from social life and served the reactionary ruling class. At that time, the teachers of higher education had no freedom of academic research. At that time, the students of higher education could not learn knowledge to serve the people after graduating from school, and after graduation, they could not get the opportunity to serve the people, and what they faced was political persecution and the threat of unemployment. At that time, the working and peasant youth were completely deprived of the opportunity to receive higher education.

The higher education of new China is completely different.

Now, every university in our country is responsible for the glorious task of cultivating socialist construction cadres for the state, and every teacher and staff member of the university are in the position of the master, consciously serving the people. Now, the problem is not that university graduates are afraid of unemployment, on the contrary, it is only that university graduates are too few, and they are far from meeting the needs of the state. The number of working and peasant youth entering universities is also increasing year by year. Now, many speed-up middle schools for workers and peasants have been established in the country, which has created the most favorable conditions for the working and peasant youth to enter universities. The great socialist construction of our country has powerfully promoted the development of higher education.

Taking Tsinghua University as an example, before liberation, the whole school had only about 2,000 students. Now, Tsinghua University has 5,500 students, which is 2.5 times the number of students before liberation. In a few years, the number of students in Tsinghua University will develop to more than 10,000, that is, at that time, the number of students will be 5 times that before liberation. Now, other universities in the country are also developing rapidly on a large scale. This situation fully reflects the vigorous development of higher education in our country, which is unimaginable in the old China.

The leap-forward progress of higher education in our country is not only reflected in the development of quantity but more importantly in the reform of teaching within the school. The main content of the teaching reform is to learn from the experience of the Soviet Union; to set up the specialties of various schools according to the needs of the state's construction; to formulate teaching plans and syllabuses according to the needs of various specialties; to carry out all teaching work in a planned way; to use the textbooks of the Soviet Union according to the actual situation of China, to introduce the most advanced scientific and technological knowledge to students; to learn the teaching system and teaching methods of the Soviet higher schools in a step-by-step and systematic way, to strengthen Marxist-Leninist political education, to strengthen the connection between theory and practice, and to strive to improve students' socialist consciousness and independent working ability.

The actual experience of teaching reform in the past two years has fully proved the great superiority of the socialist education system of the Soviet Union. Learning from the experience of the Soviet Union has caused a profound internal change in our higher schools, greatly improving the quality of education. Learning from the experience of the Soviet Union has made Tsinghua University, which has long been deeply poisoned by the thought of American imperialism, abandon the reactionary educational tradition of the Anglo-American bourgeoisie, and take big steps onto the development track of socialism.

We deeply feel that Chairman Mao's great call to "learn from the Soviet Union" has special and great significance for the reform of higher education in our country. Without learning from the experience of the Soviet Union, we cannot quickly establish a truly modern factory, and we cannot quickly establish a truly advanced university. The process of teaching reform in our higher schools is also the process of learning from the experience of the Soviet Union in a step-by-step and systematic way.

Under the leadership of the Higher Education Department of the Central People's Government and the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, our higher schools have achieved great results in learning from the Soviet Union. However, we should also point out that there are shortcomings in our work of learning from the Soviet Union, and the most serious shortcoming is formalism. There are such situations: in form, some new institutions, new courses, and new textbooks of the Soviet higher schools have been adopted, but in actual content, they have changed little, and they are still the old way, and the old content is taught. There are also such situations: it is believed that learning from the Soviet Union can ignore and not study the actual situation of China; it can ignore time, place, and conditions, and as long as the ready-made rules and regulations of the Soviet Union are copied, they can be implemented in Chinese schools. This unscientific approach naturally cannot achieve good results. To make our work progress faster, the formalistic tendency of learning from the Soviet Union should be prevented and overcome.

We deeply feel that learning from the advanced educational experience of the Soviet Union is a revolution of socialist educational thought against bourgeois educational thought in our country, and it is also the continuation and deepening of the ideological reform of higher school intellectuals. Therefore, the experience of the Soviet Union must be correctly combined with the specific situation of our transitional period, and Marxism-Leninism must be deeply implemented in all aspects of the work of our higher schools, and only on the basis of increasingly strong and solid Marxism-Leninism thought and politics, can we establish and develop high-level socialist science and technology, and successfully complete the educational reform of our higher schools. We must cultivate socialist construction talents for the state. This is a glorious and arduous task. For me personally, knowledge and experience are far from enough, and I am far from meeting the requirements of the work. We must follow the instructions of Chairman Mao Zedong, be honest, diligent, and hardworking, and strive to learn what we do not understand, and resolutely avoid any boasting and arrogance. We must, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the people's government, strive to overcome various difficulties, overcome the shortcomings and errors in our work, and strive to complete the tasks entrusted to us by the state!

Ke Qingshi's Speech

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with and support the reports of Comrade Liu Shaoqi and Premier Zhou Enlai.

The Constitution of the People's Republic of China and the reports of Comrade Liu Shaoqi and Premier Zhou Enlai, which were adopted at this conference, correctly summarize the rich experience of the revolutionary struggle and various aspects of work of the Chinese people, express the wishes and demands of the people of the whole country to build a new socialist life, point out the direction of struggle for the people of the whole country, and give great encouragement and strength to the people of the whole country. This conference will be recorded in history as a glorious page of the unity and struggle of the Chinese people to build a great socialist state.

Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao Zedong, the people of the whole country are striding forward to gradually realize the overall task of the state in the transitional period. The people of Jiangsu Province, like other regions, have achieved great results. In the past two years since the establishment of the province, industrial and agricultural production have developed greatly. In 1953, the total industrial output value of the whole province increased by 20.8% compared to 1952, and the industrial plan for 1954 will increase by 9.1% compared to 1953. In agricultural production, the total grain output of the whole province in 1953 increased by 8.2% compared to 1952, and it has increased by 76.6% compared to the early days of liberation in 1949. The material and cultural life of the people has also improved in various aspects on the basis of the improvement of production in recent years. The state's socialist transformation of agriculture, handicraft industry, and capitalist industry and commerce is also advancing continuously. Cultural and health work has also been developed and improved accordingly. From the situation in Jiangsu Province, we can also feel the greatness of the achievements that the Chinese people have achieved in recent years as listed in Premier Zhou's report.

Building a new socialist life has become the common and ardent wish of the broad masses of people. The broad masses of workers and peasants are building the great construction project with hammer and hoe, shovel and spade. Especially under the powerful call and the shining light of the gradual realization of the overall task of the state in the transitional period, the labor enthusiasm and creativity of the workers in Jiangsu Province are constantly improving. The broad masses of peasants have fought a hard battle with floods this year, making more than 30 million acres of flooded farmland, of which 23 million acres, successfully completed the work of draining water, replanting, or replanting, and in the non-disaster areas, the movement of increasing production and bumper harvest is being carried out. Through these efforts, Jiangsu's agricultural production this year has basically overcome disasters and has the possibility of completing the original production plan for this year. Various mutual aid and cooperation movements are developing rapidly, and significant progress has also been made in other fronts, showing the improvement of socialist consciousness and the great creative power of the broad masses of people. The continuous improvement of socialist consciousness among the people of the whole country will make any imperialist and counter-revolutionary unable to stop our advance!

The victory of the people is always worth singing. However, our task is to advance continuously to gradually realize the overall task of the state in the transitional period. To advance, we must recognize that there are still many difficulties to overcome on our way forward, and we must clearly see the shortcomings in our work and overcome these shortcomings without any ambiguity.

From the work in Jiangsu Province, the following lessons are particularly worthy of our attention:

First, in work, we truly implement Chairman Mao's instructions of seeking truth from facts and proceeding from reality, which is not enough. For example, in industrial and agricultural production work, sometimes there is a lack of careful investigation and research, not based on the characteristics of work, not finding the key to the problem, and doing things subjectively. Again, the Huai River project in Jiangsu Province has played a major role in intercepting and storing water for this year's flood, and our water conservancy project has achieved great results; however, after experiencing the test of the flood this year, it is found that the design of some projects is merely mechanically based on historical data (these data themselves are not complete), without carefully considering the factors of change in the past few decades (such as riverbed, length of rainy season, rain area, etc.). This subjective work style is very harmful, and we need to make great efforts to overcome it.

Second, we still have some business work that exists in the tendency of separating from politics. Some comrades still do not understand that any business work is to serve socialist construction and socialist transformation, and it is first of all a political issue. Therefore, there is often a one-sided view that lacks political consideration and only solves problems from a technical or business perspective, not from the perspective of educating cadres and mobilizing the masses to complete tasks consciously. Some work, when passed down, only leaves two numbers, one is the amount of tasks and the other is the time of completion. In this way, it will be difficult to correctly and necessarily handle problems that have complex relationships with the broad masses, thus sometimes restricting the broad masses' enthusiasm and creativity.

Third, the socialist ideological education of cadres and the broad masses of people must be closely combined with the advancement of socialist construction and socialist transformation, and must be carried out deeply without any interruption. Building a socialist society is not only a fierce economic and political struggle but also a fierce ideological struggle. Some people do not understand this point enough and do not understand that only by continuously overcoming the individualism of seeking personal gain, the arrogance of complacency, and the backward and conservative thoughts and blindly advancing thoughts in work, can our cause advance.

For the broad masses of people, educating them to get rid of the influence of backward thoughts is a long-term work. We often treat the work of educating cadres and the people with socialist ideology as a sudden campaign, satisfied with the achievements already made, not continuing to study the ideological situation of the masses, and not doing hard work of persuasion and education. This is a major reason for the shortcomings in many works.

Overcoming various subjective work styles and work styles, strengthening the correct combination of business work and political work, strengthening the constant propaganda and education work and organizational work among the masses, continuously improving the socialist ideological consciousness of cadres and the masses, and giving full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, can make our work avoid errors or reduce errors.

Finally, let us remember Chairman Mao's instructions in the opening speech. We must closely unite around the Communist Party of China, we must strive to master the ideological weapon of Marxism-Leninism, we must be modest and prudent, overcome difficulties, and advance resolutely. We must build our country into a great socialist republic, and we must be able to build our country into a great socialist republic.

    在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上
    代表们关于政府工作报告的发言
    罗荣桓代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    听了周恩来总理所作的政府工作报告，我感觉到十分兴奋，表示完全拥护。自从中华人民共和国成立以来，我们这个经历百年动乱的古老国家，由于中国共产党、毛主席和中央人民政府的英明领导，和全国人民的努力，不论在内政外交方面，都取得了一系列的胜利。五年来的事实，雄辩地证明了我国以工人阶级为领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主制度，具有着极其显著的优越性。在这个优越的社会制度下，我国各民主阶级、各民主党派、各民族人民亲密地团结起来，形成了一个巨大的社会力量，使得任何势力也阻挡不住我们前进。当然，在我们这里，并不是任何事情都已办得妥贴了，在我们的工作中，也还有一些缺点和错误。但是，我们有决心不断地改进我们的事业，并且确实也正在改进着我们的事业，因此，我们终于会把我国建成一个伟大的社会主义国家。
    五年来，政府和人民所给予军队的关怀和爱护，是无微不至的。我国人民曾以巨大的努力，支援和鼓舞了中国人民志愿军，保证了抗美援朝斗争的胜利。我们的政府和人民，更从各个方面不断地加强着中国人民解放军的现代化建设，并深切地关怀着革命军人的福利。今年春季，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会和中国人民抗美援朝总会，还组织了全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团，深入部队，进行了全面的慰问。所有这些，都使中国人民解放军的指挥员、战斗员得到极大的鼓舞和教育。
    五年来，中国人民解放军在政府和人民无微不至的关怀下，继续执行了统一全国、剿灭土匪的任务，并在遥远的边疆和漫长的海防线上，警惕地捍卫着祖国的陆地、天空和海洋。五年来，中国人民解放军亲密地团结了我国边疆的少数民族和沿海的渔民群众，帮助他们进行生产，组织他们进行对敌斗争。五年来，中国人民解放军还积极地参加了屯垦、筑路、修河、架桥、开发森林、修建工厂等经济建设事业，并帮助人民群众进行了抗旱、防洪、除虫、耕作、抢险、救灾等工作。中国人民解放军的复员转业人员以及军人家属，也努力地从事生产，踊跃地参加了国家的经济建设和农业互助合作运动。五年来，中国人民解放军同时进行了现代化的建设。坚强的人民空军、人民海军和其他特种兵，已经建立起来。一个规模广大的文化学习运动，有效地提高了人民解放军指挥员、战斗员的文化水平。正规的军事训练、政治教育和经常的文化学习，又已持续展开。所有这些，对于进一步提高中国人民解放军的战斗力，巩固国防，保卫和支援国家的社会主义建设，都是具有重大意义的。但是，自从全国解放后，军队中有些人员滋长了骄傲自满、功臣自居和贪图安逸、追求享受的情绪，在某些方面、尤其是军事工程建设方面也曾发生了违反政府法令、损害群众利益的现象，在工作上也还存在着某些分散主义。这些都是绝对不能容许的。这些现象目前已经有所纠正和正在加以纠正。在我国向社会主义社会过渡的历史时期中，由于帝国主义的包围依然存在，国内的阶级还没有消灭，所以，我军在今后仍必须时刻保持高度的警惕，并经常运用批评和自我批评的武器，及时防止和纠正各种不良的倾向。
    现在，我们不可分割的神圣领土——台湾，还没有解放。我们决不容许美帝国主义指使和支持下的蒋介石卖国集团继续盘踞台湾，中国人民解放军一定要为完成解放台湾这个光荣的战斗任务而奋斗。为此，中国人民解放军必将进一步加强陆海空军诸兵种合成军队两栖作战的训练和锻炼，把军事斗争和政治、经济的斗争密切配合起来，积极地打击敌人，保卫祖国的社会主义建设。在我们面前虽然还有许多困难，但是这些困难是可以克服的。我国人民解放台湾的斗争，将要像以往解放大陆和抗美援朝的斗争那样，必定获得最后的胜利！
    马叙伦代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    周恩来总理关于政府工作的报告和郭沫若主任关于文化教育工作的发言，我完全同意。现在我就高等教育工作的主要缺点和今后的努力方向作简要的补充发言，请各位代表指正。
    全国高等教育经过了建国初期的恢复和整顿，到一九五二年，又在全国教师思想改造运动获得很大成绩的基础上，学习苏联先进经验，改革教育制度，进行院系调整和专业设置，开始教学改革，强调了培养工农干部，从而旧的高等教育已基本上改变为工人阶级领导的、适应国家建设需要的新的高等教育，并且有了相当大的发展。根据一九五三至一九五四学年度的统计，全国共有高等学校一百八十一所，在校学生（包括研究生）二十一万六千七百六十五人，学生人数较国民党统治时期最高年度增加了百分之四十。其中高等工业学校发展最快，工科学生有八万一千二百八十四人，较一九四九年增加了百分之一百六十七。
    在整顿、改革和发展的过程中，由于我们掌握方针和了解情况都不够，计划性不强，经验也不足，因而在工作中曾经发生过许多严重的缺点。其中主要的是：在高等教育的发展上偏重数量，轻视质量，带有很大的盲目性；在院系调整和专业设置的组织安排上，有许多不够恰当的地方；在学习苏联先进经验，进行教学改革中，由于事先缺乏应有的准备，执行中要求偏高偏急，具体指导不够；学校初经调整，工作没有就绪，而师生在校内校外所参加的各种社会活动和政治活动也过多，因而各校曾相当普遍地发生忙乱现象，严重地影响了教学效果和师生健康。特别是在这一时期，许多学校对团结知识分子的工作作得很差，对学生学习纪律的教育重视不足，致使很多教师的学术专长和工作积极性没有得到应有的发挥，教师间的团结和师生间的关系，在不少学校中不够正常。以上这些缺点都影响了教学工作的顺利前进。这是我自己应当负责的。
    一九五三年初，中央提出“整顿巩固、重点发展、提高质量、稳步前进”的文教工作方针，强调“学习苏联先进经验，并与中国实际相结合”的教学改革方向，并特别指出正确贯彻团结改造知识分子政策的重要性。一年来，高等教育工作者遵循着这些指示，在中共各地党委和各地人民政府以及各方面的帮助下，基本上扭转了上述偏向，克服了忙乱现象。各校一般作到了学校一切工作以教学为中心，积极地修订教学计划、教学大纲和编译教材，改进教学方法，改善学生生活，注意体育锻炼，因而教学秩序一般得到稳定，师生健康状况有所改善，教学质量在逐步提高，使培养建设干部的工作也开始纳入国家计划的轨道。
    但是就当前情况看来，我们高等学校的发展，仍然存在一定程度的盲目性，教学质量一般还是低的。我们的政治思想领导和学校中的政治工作还是很薄弱，师生健康状况还不算好。这些问题都迫切需要我们大力加以解决。
    根据国家在过渡时期的总任务，高等教育的任务在于：相应地培养为国家社会主义建设服务的、体格健全的、热爱祖国的、具有一定马克思列宁主义思想水平的、能够掌握先进科学技术的各项专门建设人才。为了实现这一任务，今后高等教育工作，必须加强计划性，并大力提高教学质量和政治质量。具体工作主要有以下几方面：
      一、为实现有计划按比例地培养国家各项建设干部的任务，必须尽快地、正确地核计国家建设对各项专业干部的需要情况，并据以制订分专业、按比例培养干部的计划。
    二、进一步结合中国实际学习苏联经验。除尽快完成教学计划和教学大纲的制订和修订工作，大量编译教材，并积极培养提高师资以外，还必须有计划、有步骤地制订和贯彻实施各种必要的教学制度，以进一步使学校工作纳入轨道，更有力地保证教学秩序，开展科学研究工作，提高教学质量。在学习苏联先进经验、提高教学质量的各项工作中，一方面要继续克服骄傲自满、不愿学习苏联的错误思想；另一方面要注意防止不结合我国当前的具体情况、机械搬用的偏向。
    三、大力加强学校中的政治工作，对学生进行经常的社会主义思想的教育，在学生中培养优良的道德品质，提高热爱祖国、热爱劳动、热爱劳动人民、热爱公共财物和遵守法纪的思想。整饬学风，加强尊师教育。正确贯彻团结改造知识分子政策，增进教师团结。加强教师的马克思列宁主义理论的学习。有领导地展开学术思想论争，以推动科学研究工作。
    四、为了培养具有健全的体格的建设干部，对增进师生健康工作，不容稍有疏忽。必须继续认真贯彻有关增进师生健康的各项措施，特别要注意减轻学生课内课外的过重负担。
    我们知道，中华人民共和国宪法公布后，我国的社会主义建设事业将有更快的发展，培养建设干部的任务将更加艰巨。全体高等教育工作者应该在中央领导下，在全国人民的监督和支持下，兢兢业业，百倍努力，克服困难，发挥潜力，使高等教育工作更有效地为伟大的社会主义建设事业服务。
    李先念代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意周恩来总理所作的政府工作报告，我想就有关节约问题，发表一点意见：
    解放以来，我国各方面的工作都获得了伟大的成就。全国工农业生产不仅得到恢复，而且有了很大的发展。但是必须承认，我们的国家还是一个经济上落后的国家，在这样落后的基础上，要想建设成为一个繁荣、幸福的社会主义国家，必须经过长期的艰苦奋斗的过程。我们必须以空前的规模和很快的速度，进行经济建设，必须把国家的主要力量集中起来，使用在重要的建设方面，必须使国家的资金，使用的得当，使用得合理，使每一文钱都能够发挥它最大的作用。但是应该看到，我们的企业和政府部门中，直到现在还存在着相当严重的浪费和不合理的现象。
    这里，我仅就手头的若干材料来说一说：
    在基本建设方面，几年以来，我们在提高工程质量和克服浪费上，已有很大的收获；但由于建设规模很大，技术复杂，进度要求得快，许多设备和材料由国外进口，而我们的主观力量和经验又很不够，加上工作上的毛病，因而还有不少工程形成窝工浪费、材料积压、返工重造、大材小用、优材劣用以及施工现场混乱、无人负责等现象。据交通银行本年五月份不完全统计，全国基本建设所积压的器材，除已调剂处理者外，还有二万五千九百一十九亿元之多，显然其中有很大一部分是可以避免的积压。据中央建筑工程部的估计，由于各地盲目扩大计划，超过工程需要，或者由于计划不周、停工待料、停工待图，因而今年消耗在多余职工的训练和窝工方面的费用约需三千二百亿元，较去年数字还大。有些企业不是依靠提高劳动生产率、节约原料材料来降低成本，而是依靠增大工程预算，高估合同造价的办法，获取利润。有些重点工程，认为国家反正要保证重点建设，于是就大手大脚，满不在乎。有些基本建设单位，材料储备大大超过需要，施工现场无人负责。有个建筑单位竟出现“无人管理、各取所需”的招贴，敞着大门，任人自取。中央燃料工业部今年检查了太原三六○工地，发现劳动效率之低是惊人的。在效率最低的一个时候，钢筋工和模板工的效率只达到定额的百分之十五，混凝土工的工作效率只达到定额的百分之二，砌砖工的效率甚至只达到定额的二十分之一。管理人员很多，但事情办得很糟。工具用品浪费丢失情形也很严重。工人反映：“三六○工地，人多钱多，黄金铺地。”
    在国营商业方面，经营管理虽逐年有所改进，但商品流转费用所占的比例仍然是很高的，一九五三年占销售总额百分之十三点五七，无疑地，这个数字是应该可以降低的。同时，由于对产供销的情况了解不够，经营管理上有缺点，因此在商品的调拨上，往往把适宜于甲地销售的货物运到乙地，把适宜于城市销售的货物运到农村，季节性的货物调运不及时，冬货夏到，夏货冬来，形成资金积压，增加往返的运费。比如去年冬天，一个季度内由河南向广州运送活猪十几万头，由于盲目索要，盲目收购和调运，致造成毛猪惊人的死亡，计先后在运出前死亡、残伤四千零五十三头，先后在运输途中和运抵目的地交接前死亡五千五百零九头，对方接收后死亡四千一百八十四头，共损失国家财产数十亿元，造成恶劣的影响。当然，我们缺乏冷藏仓库和冷藏车船，不得不集中大量活猪，长途运送，也是造成死亡的一个原因。在货物的仓储保管上，有的地方由于警惕性不够，防卫不严，消防设备不全，因此一旦发生意外事故，损失很大。大批机械器材，保管不好，发生损坏。
    在粮食的调运和储藏保管方面，同样存在着很大的问题。把大量粮食集中管理，分配到需要的地方，当然是一件巨大的复杂的工作。在目前粮食品种不平衡、地区不平衡的情况下，在全国范围内进行粮食的调剂调度是必要的，增加一些调运的开支，也是不可避免的。但有的地方费了很大力量把粮食调运出去，最后发现这个地方粮食不够供应，不得不再花费甚至同粮价相等的运费，又从其他地方调运粮食给它。不少地方，由于入仓验收工作不严格，水分高，没有翻晒，致使仓库存粮发热、变质，有的甚至霉烂。粮食的一般损耗也很大。不少可以避免的损失，没有能够避免。
    在一般政府机关和企业、事业部门中，机构大、层次多、冗员多、效率低的现象，还没有完全克服。讲究富丽堂皇，讲究排场，用钱大手大脚的现象，也还不是个别的。
    以上所举，只是手头的一些例子，类似这样的现象还不少。这些缺点固然有许多具体的客观原因，也有些是工作发展过程中难以完全避免的，但是如果我们切实地全面地加强工作，重视节约，如果我们财务工作和财政监督工作做得好，其中许多是可以避免的。国家尽量压缩一切可以节约的开支，将大量的经费投向经济建设；全国农民和广大的人民群众，节衣缩食，出粮纳税，购买公债，以支持国家的经济建设。这些钱是来得不容易的。如果我们把它拿来不当回事，听任其浪费，这难道是可以容忍的吗？我们不少同志管理国家财政经济工作以来，眼眶子大了，动辄千亿万亿，十亿八亿的数字，似乎已经不在话下。而十亿是多少呢？它等于近一万市石的粮食，等于贫苦地区五百到八百户农民的全年收入，这个数目能说小吗？有些同志满足于工作中的若干成绩，原谅自己的缺点，他们往往这样说：“成绩是主要的，缺点是难免的，浪费损失是可能的，只要工作完成是值得的。”这种说法不是对国家负责的态度，是不正确的。谁也不能否认，几年来我们的工作成绩是主要的，我们的缺点是前进中的缺点，并且已经逐渐得到克服或正在克服。但是我们丝毫不能因此自满，因此放松对于我们自己的要求，听任缺点继续存在。
    几年以来，我们发动广大职工和国家工作人员，在工厂、矿山、工地、商店、交通运输等部门和广大农村中，开展了生产节约的各种竞赛，已经收到了很大成绩，出现了很多劳动英雄和模范人物。例如在纺织工业上，解放初期上海各纱厂，每件纱平均用棉四百一十斤，由于推广了先进经验，提高了职工觉悟，废棉率逐年降低，现在平均每件纱只用棉三百九十五斤。如果全国纱厂按此计算，每年就可节约六、七千亿元，可新建五万锭子、一千多台织布机的纺织厂两个还多。铁道部一九五三年一月至九月份共节约煤炭达十六万一千七百吨，比一九五二年同期降低了百分之十一点八，这些煤炭可供一百个列车行驶四千公里。一九五三年，中央六个工业部响应中央增产节约的号召，为国家超额创造了三万余亿元利润。中央发出的增产节约号召，经过各级党政领导机关和广大职工、全体工作人员的努力，增加了收入，节约了开支，在扭转当时财政紧张的局面上，起了很大的作用。我们的国家很大，建设的项目很多，国家机关、国营企业事业机构布满全国，业务范围很大，到处节省一点，积累起来，就成为极其可观的数字。比如全国基本建设工程，如果能按计划要求，把建筑安装费用降低百分之八，就可以为国家节省几万亿元的资金；国营和地方国营工业，如果完成降低生产成本的计划，也可以为国家节省几万亿元的资金；国营商业和对外贸易部门，如果在现有水平上，将经营管理费用降低相当于销售额的百分之一，一年以内，也可以为国家节省几万亿元的资金。这里我还联想到，我国如此之大，人口如此之多，如果平均每人每年能节约一万元，存入银行或者购买公债，国家也就能够增加几万亿元可以运用的资金。可见，能够节约的地方是很多的，如果工作抓紧，就可以对国家建设作出巨大的贡献。
    在我国，社会主义工业化的资金，不能像帝国主义那样依靠向殖民地掠夺，这是资本主义国家曾经走过的道路，我们决不走这样的道路。社会主义积累的唯一可靠办法，就是内部积累，就是一面积极地增加生产，增加收入，扩大社会主义本身的积累；一面厉行节约，紧缩开支，把每一文钱用到最必需的地方，最大限度地发挥资金的作用。节约是社会主义积累的重要源泉，是社会主义经营的主要方法。我们国家的经济建设，存在着两种可能：一种是增加生产，提高质量，降低成本和商品流转费用，加强计划性，全面地超额地完成国家计划，以便加速工业化的进度；一种是经营管理不好，浪费很多，影响国家整个的计划，推迟工业化的进度。我们应该努力避免后一种可能，争取前一种可能的实现。
    我们要求各个国营企业，逐步提高企业的管理水平，努力学习苏联先进经验，提高劳动生产率，降低成本和商品流转费用，加速资金的周转；要求国家财政系统和各个财务管理单位，加强财务管理，加强财政监督，加强财政纪律；要求国家工作人员和全体职工，节约国家的财力物力，反对铺张，反对浪费，同一切破坏财政纪律、盗窃国家资财的现象，进行坚决的斗争；要求全国人民，厉行节约，提倡储蓄，扩大自己的生产。我们相信，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，只要全国人民与政府合作，一定能够进一步实行增产节约，保证国家社会主义工业化的顺利进行。
    过去，我们财政工作在这方面没有尽到监督检查的责任，财政监察的工作没有认真地建立起来，对上边所说的缺点，也要负很大的责任。
    李烛尘代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    在大会上听到了周总理的政府工作报告，使我非常兴奋。我国五年来伟大的建设成就，特别是经济建设上突飞猛进的成就，使社会主义经济成份在整个国民经济中的比重不断增长，领导力量不断加强，并为实现社会主义改造准备了物质基础，从而保证了人民物质生活和文化生活水平的不断提高，这是十分令人欢欣鼓舞的事情。我代表天津代表，拥护周总理的政府工作报告，并建议大会通过这一报告。
    我虽然在政府担任着职务，但个人的主要工作还是面对着工商界的。周总理报告里指示我们，在国家经济建设当中，改造资本主义工商业，也是一项重要的任务，更感到责任重大。自国家过渡时期总路线和总任务宣布后，私营工商业者大部分经过学习，接受社会主义改造，自愿地走上国家资本主义道路的已日益增多，但顽强固执或观望迟疑者亦为数不少。因此，我愿意在这一方面，向全国私营工商业者进一言，并向人民政府提几点建议：
    第一、工商业者应该认清社会发展的前途。目前我们国家正逐步地过渡到社会主义社会，这是社会发展的必然趋势，这个趋势不是以人们的意志为转移的，也是人力所不能抗拒的。私营工商业者只有顺着这个方向走去才有光明的前途，这是最清楚不过的了。
    第二、国家对资本主义工商业采取利用、限制和改造的政策，并鼓励和指导它们转变为各种不同形式的国家资本主义经济，逐步以全民所有制代替资本家所有制。这一正确的方针，几年来业已行之有效，现在又在中华人民共和国宪法里固定下来，私营工商业者只有走这条具体的道路，才能更妥善地实现企业和个人的改造，这也是最清楚不过的了。
    第三、几年来无数生动的事实证明，资本主义企业在公私合营之后，由于生产关系的改变，企业生产的纳入国家计划轨道，以及企业经营管理工作的改善，生产迅速增加，工人的劳动条件和物质生活有了相应的改善，盈余也有增加，资本家的利润也有保证；资本家和资方代理人由于经常直接地受到公方代表的领导、教育和工人群众的帮助、监督，也较易于结合企业的改造进行个人的思想改造。在工作岗位上只要能守职尽责，就一定会有职有权；只要能努力学习，就一定会改造得好。到进入社会主义社会的时候，你能够掌握新的生产技术和新的管理方法，又能忠诚老实地为人民服务，国家必将给以适当的安排，并按贡献的大小得到相应的报酬。到那时，虽然阶级消灭了，但这些资本家个人已改造成为劳动者，就能够同全国劳动人民一道，过着美满幸福的生活，这也是最清楚不过的了。所以我认为任何一个私营工商业者对于这条社会主义改造的道路现在再也不应该有什么怀疑了，再也不应该有什么观望和等待了，赶快搞通思想，心安理得地接受改造，这就是唯一的也是最好的出路。
    第四、一年以来，中国民主建国会和中华全国工商业联合会的所有会员曾普遍地受到一次爱国守法的教育，肯定说是有些成绩的。但也有一部分会员说什么“爱国容易守法难”，或者说“无法可守”，这些说法都曾分别地加以纠正。宪法草案公布后，许多私营工商业者看到宪法草案第十条规定“国家依照法律保护资本家的生产资料所有权和其他资本所有权”，第十一条规定“国家保护公民的合法收入、储蓄、房屋和各种生活资料的所有权”，并第十二条规定“国家依照法律保护公民的私有财产的继承权”，都感到高兴，这是可以理解的。但是因为宪法这几条对他们有利，就大大地触动了他们唯利是图的劣根性，钻起空子来了。据民建会和工商联各地方会员的反映，有许多私营工商业者设法抽走资金，购买生活资料，或大吃大喝，把有用的资本就这样的消耗了。这是一种可恶的现象——而且像这样一种钻宪法空子的作法，都是抗拒情绪的表现，就大大的违反宪法的精神，是全国人民所不许可的。对于这样的私营工商业者，应该劝告他们老老实实，爱护资本，只有把它拿去扩大建设，增加生产，为人民多做些好事，人民自然不会忘记他们的，况且宪法还有第十三条和第十四条的规定，不法行为当然是要受到制止的，所以我在这里严肃的加以警告。
    但就目前形势看，各大城市中较大的私营工业走上国家资本主义高级形式的道路的已经越来越多了，中级形式的加工、订货也已占了很大的比重。天津市一九五三年公私合营工厂有二十三户，一九五四年计划发展六十一户，对于一些需要和可能实行公私合营的工厂也作了必要的准备工作。一九五三年全年，国家对于私营工厂的加工、订货、包销、收购，平均占私营工业总产值的百分之六十五点四七，一九五四年上半年已增到百分之八十以上。
    在私营商业方面，粮、油、纱布已在整个行业的规模上得到改造，人员也得到适当的安排，其他许多私营零售商也已经和国营商业建立了业务关系，纳入国家计划。这是我们国家现实生活中正在发生着的巨大而深刻的变化，这是可喜的现象，任何资本主义工商业者应该欢迎这件事情，而不应当害怕和逃避这件事情。据我所知，对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造中还存在着几个问题，提出供有关国家行政机关参考：（一）在私营商业的转业中，有些工业需要钱而不需要人，有些商业有钱也有人，人要跟着一齐转，这就使双方谈不拢来，工业吸收不到资金，得不到发展；商业无事可作，坐吃山空。这一问题，有待政府有关部门和各地民主建国会、工商业联合会协助抓紧解决。（二）有许多中小型工厂在国家建设上是起着一定的配合作用的；但是由于分散、落后，没有公私合营的条件，潜在力量不能充分发挥。希望政府能够尽量鼓励和指导它们，并尽可能使在生产工序上互相衔接和互相依存的工厂组织起来，以便走上公私合营的道路。只有这样才能充分地发挥现有企业的作用，更好地为国家建设和人民需要服务。斯大林在第一个五年计划的总结中曾说过：“熟习新企业和新技术，要比利用那些技术已经熟习的旧工厂或革新工厂的事情困难得多。”这正是我们目前应该学习的宝贵经验。（三）公私合营工业几年来已获得许多经验，今年政府又公布了公私合营工业企业暂行条例，今后申请公私合营的私营企业一定日渐增多。希望政府事先培养干部，加紧训练，以供配备，这也是值得注意的一个关键性问题。
    至于私营工商业者重犯“五毒”的，应该严加纠正。不过我感到纠正的方法，可以充分利用政府机关的检查、国营企业的领导和工人群众的监督，随时揭发检举，随时处理通告，这样就会使违法者知所改悔，落后者不敢尝试，同时也不至于影响爱国守法、从事正当经营的工商业者的积极情绪。私营工商业者有他阶级本质的劣根性，在改造过程中，是需要一个长时期的循循善诱的帮助的。
    各位代表：我国用和平转变方式改造资本主义工商业的经济政策，是完全符合我国现实情况的。国家机关及国营企业的工作人员，资本主义工商业者，都应该很好地完成这一对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的任务。让我们工商业者高举着社会主义改造的旗帜，大踏步地向前迈进吧！
    陈永康代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我听了周总理的政府工作报告，表示完全拥护。
    贵州将近四百万的少数民族，解放前长期过着被压迫的牛马生活。
    一九四九年冬，中国共产党和毛主席解放了贵州，我们才翻身成为新社会新国家的主人。解放初期，我们少数民族积极协助解放军肃清了全省土匪；后来，我们又积极参加了清匪反霸、镇压反革命和抗美援朝等运动；我们又协助政府禁绝了帝国主义和蒋匪帮多年来毒害贵州人民的鸦片烟。
    随着剿匪和清匪反霸的胜利，根据少数民族人民的迫切要求，在少数民族地区进行了土地改革，土地改革中，每人分得约六百斤产量的土地。从此，我们永远摆脱了“乌鸦无树桩，苗家无地方，十几岁姑娘无衣裳”的苦难日子了。少数民族政治觉悟和生产积极性大大提高。几年来，在政府大力扶持下，年年都增产，真正是土改加丰年，年年有余粮，生活已有很大改善。解放前很多人吃蕨巴度日，穿不上衣服，吃不上盐巴的悲惨生活，已一去永不复返了。现在，我们每个人已能吃到粮食，一九五三年平均每人一年能吃盐巴八斤多，穿布一丈三尺多。
    根据群众自愿和照顾民族特点，在少数民族的人民中，已逐步开展互助合作运动，组织了农业生产合作社六十四个。几年来，人民政府在少数民族地区发放了农业贷款一千一百六十多亿元，帮助少数民族人民兴修了中小型水利，改进了耕作技术，发放了无偿农具贷款一百三十八亿元。高寒山区“赶山吃饭”、“广种薄收”、“脚踏手扯”的生产落后状况，逐步有了改进。
    同时，中国共产党和人民政府又帮助我们实行区域自治，现已建立六个县、九个区、三个乡的民族自治区，培养了七千多个脱离生产的民族干部参加政府的各项工作，使我们真正当家作主了。
    少数民族地区的贸易、文教、卫生工作也有了很大的发展。已在二十五个县建立民族贸易商店，在许多区、乡设立民族区商店、民族贸易小组，土、特产品都向外畅销，如罗甸县布依族自治区的香蕉芭蕉，过去是喂猪，现已供不应求了。全省办了民族学院一所，民族中学十二所，师范一所，在学的少数民族中小学生十七万四千多人，过去少数民族人民被剥夺受教育权利的情况已根本改变。在少数民族地区建立了一百九十六个卫生医疗机构，展开了卫生工作，疾病大大减少，如罗甸等县的恶性疟疾，已基本消灭。
    四年多来，在中央人民政府和毛主席正确领导下，我们少数民族地区各项工作的成绩是很大的。我们贵州省少数民族在政治上已得到平等，物质和文化生活已有很大提高。
    此外，我们感到过去对木材价格的规定，地区差价很大，不够合理，请求中央统一规定木材价格，以维护林区农民的合理收益。有的自治县机关，对民族特点注意不够，对民族干部的作用发挥不够，应该改进。
    我们少数民族深深感到，只有在共产党和毛主席领导下，才会有民族平等，才会前进到社会主义社会。今天宪法上又规定保障少数民族的各种权利，使我们愈加感到统一的多民族的伟大祖国空前大团结的温暖可爱！
    我们要认真贯彻执行周总理的工作报告，多增产粮食来支援国家工业化、支援解放台湾。台湾一天不解放，我们决不干休。
    李四光代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意周恩来总理所作的政府工作报告。
    五年来，在中国共产党和中央人民政府的正确领导下，在毛主席的关怀下，由于全体地质工作人员积极努力、苏联专家热忱帮助和全国人民大力支持，我国地质勘探工作有了迅速的发展。
    解放初期的工作，主要是接收并整理旧有的地质机构和适当地集中全国地质工作人员。一九五○年地质工作计划指导委员会成立以后，在调整全国地质机构的基础上，开始了有计划的矿产勘探和地质调查工作。一九五二年九月中央人民政府地质部正式成立，按照中央“大发展大转变”的指示，调集了大批的干部，增加了大量的设备，有重点地迅速发展了大规模的矿产勘探和普查工作，以迎接国家第一个五年计划中地质部门所应当承担的光荣任务。
    经过这几年的努力，我们在全国范围内，已经探明了若干主要矿产的储量，初步地使国家第一个五年计划建设的需要得到了保障；同时也迅速地壮大了地质勘探的队伍。
    在中南地区，我们已经探明了的铁矿储量，超过了过去的估计量将近两倍；在西北地区的一个大的铁矿区，我们已经证实了它的储量达到过去的估计量的几十倍。新煤田的发现和旧煤田的扩大，据初步估计，至少可以基本满足国家在第一个五年计划中新建立的工业基地和铁道运输的要求。
    我们还发现了一个新的巨型铜矿；全国各地旧的铜矿区也较前扩大。关于铅、锌、锡、钨、锰、铝等项重要金属原料，都找到了适当的矿区，正在分别进行重点勘探；铬、镍、镉、铈、钽、铍、水银、白金等项工业上贵重原料的产地，也陆续都有发现。
    旧中国的“地质遗产”是有限的。直到解放时期，全国实际从事地质调查和研究工作的不过一百人左右。解放后，我们以各种不同的方式大力培养地质干部。现在，单就中央地质部来说，我们全部的地质工作人员，包括钻探、坑探、物探、化验、测量各项人员，比解放前的综合地质勘探力量加大了九十多倍。现在还正在北京、长春两个地质学院和西安、重庆、武汉、南京、长春、宣化等六个中等地质学校以及几个综合大学的地质学系，培养更多的新生力量。适应人力的增长，设备也有大量的增加。
    如上所述，我们的工作已经有了一定的成就，但我们工作中的缺点也还不少。
    各位代表，我们必须牢牢地记着毛主席的指示：“力戒任何的虚夸和骄傲”。我相信大家会完全同意陈毅同志和其他几位代表发言的精神，以负责的态度来处理我们工作中的缺点和错误。在我自己的工作范畴中有以下几个严重的问题：
    第一、我们对地质工作的综合性认识不够，各方面工作的发展往往不平衡。例如，就勘探矿种和矿量来说，铁、煤虽然已经能够基本上满足国家第一个五年计划的要求，而对于冶金、机械、电力、化工、建筑等方面所必需的各种岩矿原料的供应问题，还未完全解决。我们虽然为了适应重工业建设当前的迫切需要，正确地部署了重点勘探，并为猎取后备产地，初步开展了普查工作，但对于改造农业技术方面的要求，如磷矿和钾盐以及地下水勘探工作，却作得太少。各个专业部门技术人员的数额，大都不合必需的比例。工程地质和水文地质方面力量的薄弱，一直是我们全面推动地质工作中最大的困难。这些情况，有时造成某些企业单位局部工作脱节和窝工的现象，甚至发生不遵守正常勘探施工程序的严重错误。
    第二、各个地质工作部门之间，彼此的联系不够。各部门彼此相互协助的工作做得不够，以致有限的人力物力不能联合起来作有效的使用，也很少交流经验，甚至通过国家巨额投资和费了大量劳动所获得的宝贵资料，由于登记、保管以及使用的制度不够完善，没有充分发挥作用。
    第三、在学习苏联先进经验，特别在学习工作规范和操作规程方面，两年来有了很大的成就；但由于学习时期不久，原有的技术水平不高，学习不够透彻，因此，我们还不能深入地掌握苏联先进科学技术的精神，同时结合着我国实际情况，及时发现问题、解决问题。有些工作人员往往单纯依赖苏联专家，不能主动地运用苏联先进经验来总结自己的工作经验，从而创造自己的工作成果。
    第四、由于赶任务，在我们一部分工作中存在着单纯追求数量、忽视质量的现象。这在钻探工作中，尤其显著，如只顾进尺，忽视岩芯收回率。在化验、测量、地质普查方面也有类似的现象。
    这些缺点之所以产生，固然同我们的任务大、力量小、工作经验不够有关；而更重要的是同地质部的各级领导方面在制定计划时和执行计划时所存在的主观主义、官僚主义、教条主义分不开的。我们工作中的计划性不够，在我们的计划工作中常常缺乏预见性。这主要是由于我们还没有充分掌握由近代科学技术条件所决定的各项工作定额；同时也由于没有充分地了解地质情况和各项矿产产生的规律。只有结合着生产实践，深入地从事科学研究，才能够逐步提高我们的技术水平，加强我们的工作的计划性。
    今天有了全国地质工作人员一致的坚决努力和全国人民的大力支援，在毛主席的光辉旗帜下，我们坚信上述的各项困难，是一定能够克服的。在祖国的社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的伟大事业中，地质部门所担当的光荣任务，是一定能够完成的。在毛主席的英明领导下，我们也坚信全国的地质工作者一定能够同其他部门的科学工作者团结一致，结合各自业务上的要求，钻研马克思列宁主义和毛泽东的著作，来迅速提高我们社会主义觉悟和科学技术水平，创造必要的物质条件，以保证最后完成祖国的神圣的解放事业，消灭残余的蒋介石卖国集团，解放台湾这一伟大历史任务。
    永远领导中国人民朝着光明幸福的前途胜利前进的核心力量中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民的伟大导师毛主席万岁！
    邓宝珊代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意周恩来总理的政府工作的报告。
    我们国家五年来在各方面的巨大成就，生动地表明了人民民主制度的优越性。解放前的甘肃曾被人用三个字来形容，就是“乱、旱、穷”。在长期的反动统治的年代里，由于统治阶级的残酷剥削，各民族之间的严重隔阂，自然灾害的不断侵袭，甘肃各民族人民被拖到了绝境。解放以来，在短短五年期间，甘肃的情况已经发生了根本的变化。各民族人民在平等的基础上，建立了友爱互助的新关系。一九五三年，甘肃人民在历史上第一次用自己的力量胜利地渡过了严重的旱灾。工业、农业和畜牧业生产有了显著发展。国民经济中社会主义成份稳步增长。在全省现代工业和工场手工业的产值中，国营、合作社和公私合营所占的比重，到一九五三年已达百分之七十七点三五。参加农业生产互助合作组织的农户，到今年春耕前，已占总农户数的百分之五十二点三八。在发展生产的基础上，各民族人民的生活有了改善。这是中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的正确领导以及各民族人民共同努力的结果。
    但是，就甘肃目前的情况来说，在经济上和文化上还是相当落后的。要从根本上改变这种情况，仍是一个相当长期的艰巨任务。因此，我们今后必须更好地团结各民族人民，作更多的、更加艰苦的努力。
    为了做好甘肃今后的工作，我们还必须时刻注意防止和克服工作中可能发生的缺点和错误。
    五年来，我们在工作中是有不少的缺点和错误的。主要是我们对下面情况了解不够，对甘肃地方的特点体会不深，因而在某些措施上，未能很好地照顾到各民族、各地区的实际情况。尤其应当注意的是：有些干部在工作有了成绩以后，就产生了骄傲自满情绪，结果使某些工作遭到了不应有的损失。这些缺点和错误的所以产生，固然有多方面的原因，但同我们领导工作中的缺点是分不开的。拿我个人来说，在参加政府工作后，曾经有过作客思想，有一些应当提出的意见，没有及时地直爽地提出来。对于学习，特别是对于中央各项政策的学习，抓得不紧。这说明：在我当时的思想上，并没有很好地认识到自己对人民事业有着一种无可推卸的责任。我的这些缺点，由于中国共产党的关怀和帮助，几年来已经有所改进，但今后仍应继续努力克服，保证进一步做好自己的工作来回答人民对我的委托和信任。
    各位代表，我完全相信：在中国共产党和我们伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，在中华人民共和国宪法的光辉照耀下，只要我们虚心学习，努力工作，戒骄戒躁，正确地开展批评与自我批评，密切联系人民群众，我们就一定能够把我们的祖国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家。
    章蕴代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全赞同和热烈拥护周总理的政府工作报告。在这个报告中，一方面看到了五年来政府在社会改革、恢复和发展国民经济、改善人民物质生活和文化生活及其他工作方面所作的重大努力和由此而获得的辉煌成就；另一方面也看到了政府执行和平外交政策的坚毅精神和伟大胜利。我们面对祖国欣欣向荣的新气象和日益提高的国际地位，感到无限兴奋。
    我是一个妇女工作者，在这里，我想就政府对贯彻男女平等政策发表一点意见。我们的政府是中国人民自己的政府，它的光辉是照耀着一切人民的，它的施政也是为了一切人民的。五年来，政府根据共同纲领的规定，在废除束缚妇女的封建制度，保障男女平等和保护母亲和儿童利益方面，采取了许多重大措施，根本改变了旧中国妇女被奴役被压迫的状态，使中国妇女在政治、经济、文化教育、社会生活及家庭生活各方面，逐步取得了男女平等权利。其结果，就大大地鼓舞了妇女热爱祖国、保卫祖国、建设祖国的积极性，踊跃参加建设祖国的各项工作，从而使妇女逐步成为国家建设的一支重要力量。广大妇女群众一个共同的基本的反映是：回忆过去，痛定思痛；看到今天，喜笑颜开；展望前途，信心百倍。这些事实充分证明了男女平等、婚姻自由、保护母亲和儿童，不仅有利于妇女儿童，而且是整个社会改革重要的组成部分；同时也是发动群众自觉地参加祖国建设不可缺少的重要政策之一。
      但是有些政府工作人员对于共同纲领规定的上述政策，还有认识不足和执行不力或者执行得不正确的现象。如在发动群众来执行政策法令方面，往往忽略妇女群众，低估妇女的力量和作用，不能经常地注意男女一齐发动，以致不能充分发动妇女支持政府的政策。在贯彻婚姻法方面，虽然取得了很大的成绩，但有些政府工作人员对婚姻法采取漠视和冷淡的态度，对婚姻法的贯彻执行任其自流、不推不动，甚至有些工作人员还有或轻或重的违反婚姻法的行为。因此，中央人民政府政务院有关经常宣传贯彻婚姻法的指示，还没有能够普遍贯彻下去。此外，在学前儿童教育与幼儿保育工作方面，政府有些主管部门，也未能予以应有的注意；有些主管部门，未能从实际出发，作适当的安排，以致人力物力的使用不够确当，没有产生应有的效果。产生以上情况的原因，主要是某些政府工作人员，还存在着重男轻女的封建残余思想。由于这种思想，他们不能正确地理解男女平等政策和保护婚姻、家庭、母亲、儿童的政策的基本精神和重大意义，从而也就影响了他们执行这些政策的自觉性和积极性。也有些人，是因为对上述政策学习不够、执行方法不恰当、经验不足的缘故。因此，我建议各级政府在继续推行男女平等和婚姻自由、保护母亲儿童政策的同时，加强对干部的政策教育，克服封建残余思想，经常地有计划地检查上项政策的执行情况，不断总结经验，改进工作方法，以期获得更光辉的成绩。
    我们全国妇联和各级妇联组织，尤其应当在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，认真检查自己的工作，克服缺点，更进一步发动广大妇女群众，响应各民主党派各人民团体为解放台湾联合宣言和周总理的号召，为胜利完成解放台湾，为建设繁荣幸福的社会主义社会，为争取妇女彻底解放而奋斗。
    吴德代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意和衷心拥护周总理的政府工作报告。
    天津市自解放以来，在中国共产党和中央人民政府的正确领导下，经过全市各界各族人民的努力，生产得到了发展，经济得到了繁荣，广大劳动人民的物质和文化生活得到了适当的改善。一九五三年全市工业总产值较一九四九年增加了二点七二倍，职工人数增加一点二倍；全市商业零售总额较一九五○年增加了一点三倍，社会主义经济迅速壮大，资本主义工商业也得到了一定的改造。这些，对进一步贯彻执行国家过渡时期的总任务提供了有利条件。
    几年来，天津市的地方工业生产有了迅速发展，在支援国家建设和供应人民需要上起了一定的作用。但是由于我们政治思想领导不够，计划管理和技术管理不强，至今还存在着质量低、成本高、品种少、事故多的缺点，我们正在努力克服这些缺点。同时，我们感到中央对地方工业的发展方针是正确地，但是，也觉得在计划掌握上是不够严密的，对现有设备能力的充分发挥注意不够，因而一方面某些地方盲目地建筑新厂，一方面有些原有工厂陷于停工半停工状态。例如天津市有些新药、电线、针织等厂的生产即因此受到了很大影响，这一点我希望中央有关部门今后加以注意。
    几年来，天津市对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的工作，已有了初步成绩。对于资本主义工业的改造方面，截至目前为止，已经实行公私合营（高级形式的国家资本主义企业）的工厂，其产值占私营大型工业总产值的百分之二十七。这些企业合营后，由于生产关系的改变，生产纳入了国家计划，出现了许多新气象，产量、质量和劳动生产率显著提高，成本也有所降低。同时，原企业人员也得到了适当的安排，资方分得了合理利润，从而改变了某些资本家对公私合营的消极观望态度。此外，在中级形式和低级形式的国家资本主义方面，为国家加工、订货、包销、收购的产值总额已占私营大型工业产值总额的百分之九十一。这些接受国家加工、订货、包销、收购的企业的生产，也在不同程度上纳入了国家计划的轨道，初步改进了生产管理，发挥了一定的积极作用。但是由于我们对市场供需情况了解不够，加工订货有时多时少，成本计算上还存在着偏高偏低的现象。这些缺点当继续纠正。同时目前还有一部分资本家对加工订货采取消极态度，甚至重犯五毒，仍须加强教育、管理，予以制止。
    对于资本主义商业的改造方面，由于人民购买力提高，许多商品出现供不应求的现象，根据中央的指示，我们实行了食粮、食油、棉布等物品的计划供应，保证了人民的基本需要，保持了市场的稳定，受到了人民群众的热烈拥护。由于计划供应的实行及国家加工订货的增加，市场起了根本的变化。有组织的市场迅速扩大，某些私营批发商在流通环节中失去了作用。现在我们对这些私营批发商采取了辅导其转入工业、由国营公司吸收为从业人员或转为二批发、零售等办法，予以安排；对粮食、食油、猪肉、牛羊肉、茶叶、纱布等行业零售商，也实行了多种形式的国家资本主义，一面维持其继续营业，一面进行社会主义改造。
    在天津市，资本主义工商业在整个社会经济中仍占很大比重。因此，今后对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的工作仍很艰巨。我们决心继续遵照积极的稳步的方针，加强计划性，继续贯彻利用、限制和改造的政策，提高警惕，防止不法资本家的破坏活动，逐步完成对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的任务。
    我们向大会保证：坚决贯彻执行大会的各项决议，为解放台湾、争取社会主义建设和社会主义改造的胜利而奋斗。
    张难先代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我对周总理的报告，表示竭诚的拥护！
    解放后五年来，我一直在中南区工作。五年来，政府的决策，干部的奋斗，取得了不可估量的成绩；胜利消息如雪片飞来，一切都是有史以来所未有的，我经常掩不住内心的兴奋。
    我们的国家真是取得了伟大成绩，却同时也难免有些缺点的。过去每一涉及到工作中的缺点，我总是这样想：政府一切措施都是惊天动地的举动，很是艰难，既然共产党和毛主席领导全国人民把国家搞得这样光辉灿烂，我大可不必拿些小问题去搅扰政府，所以遇着我所认为的缺点，有些是“口欲言而嗫嚅”的。这样想，当然不对。但，有些意见，我还是同政府内的中共负责同志讲过了的，而且，常常为他们所接受。现在，我作了人民代表，更应当做到“知无不言”，那怕是小问题，今后也一定要多向政府反映，我想，政府一定会如过去一样，是会很诚恳地欢迎我们讲出来的，我们也确实是有责任要讲出来的。
    我们政府这五年的伟大成绩，是从土地改革、抗美援朝、镇压反革命、“三反”、“五反”和思想改造等等大运动得来的。没有这几个伟大的运动，我们的国家就难得有今天的成绩。比方说，如果不进行土地改革，就不可能设想能够消灭封建剥削的地主阶级；如果不进行抗美援朝，就不能保家卫国；如果不进行镇压反革命，就不能巩固革命秩序；如果不进行“三反”“五反”，就不可能在极短时期内扫除了痼蔽几千年的贪污腐败风习，树立新的道德，就不可能打退当时资产阶级的猖狂进攻。但是，每一个具有全国规模的运动，不能说就没有一点不周到的地方，或者绝对不出一点点小的错误或偏差。共产党和人民政府在掌握运动的时候，力求避免一切可能避免的错误与偏差，这是我几年来亲眼见到的好作风，也是有目共睹的事实。但是，在运动中，在掌握得不够和群众发动得不够的处所，就难免因主观判断或因不纯分子钻空子，出了偏差。这些偏差，虽不损害运动的主要成就，但如不纠正，就会使一部分群众对政府不满，也使干部得不到教育。我们的责任就是要帮助党和政府把那些尽管是极小的错误和偏差，反映出来，使偏差尽可能减少，这样才能使运动更彻底。否则，就难免出些毛病。如果出了毛病，我们也有一定责任。
    这几年，我常接见乡下农民，从他们口里听到许多农村的大喜事，如减租退押、土地改革、统购统销、发展农业互助合作组织等等，这都是农民高兴万分的。但是，也有某些落后乡村搞得不好，部分干部犯有强迫命令的毛病；有的地区的工作，就搞得有些粗糙。有些农民时常反映：开会太多，任务太多，吃不消。对于这些农民，我随时安慰他们说，创业是艰难的，我们建成社会主义的国家，大家就都会过美满幸福的日子，你们千万要有耐心；但另一方面，我也觉得，今后要注意教育乡村干部，改变强迫命令的作风，精简会议，布置任务不要影响农民生产，更要注意在某些落后的地区，要十分耐心谨慎地把农民引导到社会主义社会去。
    提供这些不成熟的意见，请各位代表指教。
    黄长水代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    周总理的政府工作报告，说明我国政府和全国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下的努力奋斗所得的成果，已经为我国过渡到社会主义社会，为我国人民争取未来的更美满幸福快乐的生活奠下了巩固的基础。我完全同意和衷心拥护周总理这个报告。
    和祖国人民幸福生活相对比，国外侨胞的现况是很艰苦困难的。由于资本主义经济危机的袭击，和美帝国主义“封锁禁运”的威胁，华侨在国外谋生就业的范围是日益缩小了。加上在美帝国主义的威迫强制下，有些国家的政府已经实施经济排挤政策，摧残华侨工商业。如菲律宾政府最近颁布“零售商菲化法案”，禁止华侨经营零售商业，直接威胁二十万留菲华侨的生活权利；泰国政府宣布数十种行业不准华侨经营，使华侨工商业家与工人处于破产和失业的悲惨境地。因此，华侨工商界眼看到自己祖国经济建设的繁荣发展，已经有人转而积极参加祖国的工农业建设。解放以来，归侨中工商业界在人民政府的正确领导和积极帮助之下，已经创立了华南企业公司、华侨工业建设公司、广州投资公司、福建投资公司和新侨饭店股份有限公司等五家公私合营企业。此外在各省侨区，归国华侨也参加当地手工业和农村生产合作事业，投资垦殖事业，建筑住宅，兴办学校等，对农村的建设，起了一定的作用。这些都是侨胞热爱祖国、热诚希望参加祖国生产建设的具体表现。
    国家对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造，鼓励和指导他们转变为各种不同形式的国家资本主义经济，逐步以全民所有制代替资本家所有制，这是我国在过渡时期的总任务中重要的一个组成部分，这条道路是绝对正确的。但是由于国外华侨工商界的处境及其他种种原因，一般地说来，他们的投机性和追求暴利的思想作风都比较严重，因而对归国的华侨工商界进行有计划的社会主义改造，使他们自觉地遵守国家政策法令，不要违法乱纪，这是根本的方面。可是，考虑到国外华侨工商界还不能像国内工商界一样地受到社会主义改造，就是在将来祖国完全进入社会主义社会时，国外华侨工商界的情况可能还不会有根本的改变，而回国的华侨工商界还同国外保持千丝万缕的联系，同时又不断受到国外的影响，因此，在回国的华侨工商界中进行社会主义改造的工作就非常复杂，需要特别的韧性与耐心来进行。这是华侨工商界的特点。另一方面，国外华侨工商界的一小部分，在祖国实行社会主义改造当中，可能会被帝国主义欺骗、蒙蔽和软化；但是，由于帝国主义对华侨日益加紧的压迫，相信相当大部分的华侨工商界，将会继续拥护祖国，支持祖国过渡到社会主义，使祖国建设成富强繁荣的国家，这又是一个特点。这些就说明对回国的华侨工商界一方面要坚决贯彻社会主义改造，反对任何违法乱纪行为；另一方面又需要根据华侨工商界的特点，适当地予以必需的照顾。这就要求一整套对回国的华侨工商界进行社会主义改造的方针和政策。这一点在今天来说是非常需要的。
    在总路线公布以后，国外华侨工商界对于在国内的资本主义工商业如何进行社会主义改造，祖国进入社会主义社会时对华侨在国内投资的资金和生产资料如何处理等问题，是表示关心的。他们希望政府在社会主义改造中以至将来建成社会主义社会以后，在处理华侨工商界投资的资金和生产资料时，能考虑照顾国外华侨的特殊情况，在一般都须接受社会主义改造的前提下是否可以同对国内工商界的处理稍为有所不同。
    其次，近年以来的归国华侨，很多是小工商业者，带回有限的积蓄资金。他们不愿投资于私营工商业，而希望投资于公私合营企业，同时希望参加工作，解决其本身的就业问题。这也是归国华侨为了解决生活和出路的普遍要求。因而我建议，凡有华侨参加的公私合营企业似乎应该尽量照顾投资者的愿望，尽可能适当解决他们的就业问题。这样既可广泛地吸收小额投资，发挥积累资金的积极作用，又可以使这部分归侨不致坐吃山空，这是一举两得的事。
      再次，华侨工商界中有不少是人不回来，只汇款回来投资的。他们希望有固定的股息以赡养其国内眷属，供给子女上学费用，准备本人将来回国时有所依靠。解放初期，有华侨参加的公私合营企业，章程上都规定有固定的股息，但目前由于公私合营企业经营情况不同，这个规定的执行也有些差别，甚至有些地方根本取消了固定股息，使部分华侨投资的积极性，受到了影响。固然，现在机械地确定一成不变的股息，在目前是有困难的；但是完全废除固定股息的办法也值得再三考虑。希望有关部门，对华侨投资保障股息的要求，在合乎国家政策法令和不损害国家利益的原则下，给以可能的照顾。
    邓子恢代表的发言，据我了解，意思是说，允许华侨向国家租用山林、荒地经营农林等事业，给予充分的租用期限。这又给华侨投资开辟了一条新的道路；也充分体现政府对华侨的照顾。但为了进一步发挥华侨工商界参加祖国建设事业的积极性，我建议政府应根据国家的长远利益和华侨的特殊情况，除制订华侨租用国家山林荒地从事垦荒生产的办法以外，还要制订辅导华侨回国投资的具体办法，并贯彻施行。
    国外华侨的家乡多在祖国大陆。台湾蒋匪帮企图骗取华侨在国外的资金和外汇，以供台湾匪帮作为祸国殃民之用。蒋匪帮这一阴谋，是不会成功的。我相信，我们采取适当照顾国外华侨工商界的政策，消除国外华侨的一切顾虑，就一定能够粉碎蒋匪帮的阴谋，争取华侨所有的一切力量贡献给祖国的建设。
    建国五年来，广大的归国华侨和侨眷都亲眼看见祖国各项建设事业的伟大成就。祖国已进入社会主义建设和社会主义改造时期，这次全国人民代表大会又通过了宪法，我相信所有归侨、侨眷和国外一千二百万侨胞对祖国这些伟大的措施都会热烈拥护的。
    周泽昭代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意周总理的政府工作报告。
    我是一个医生，也是卫生行政工作者，我想对卫生工作中的中西医团结问题发表一点意见。
    还在一九四四年，毛主席在陕甘宁边区文教工作者会议上就已经提出了关于中西医务工作者团结的号召。解放后，中国共产党中央又一再指示，要卫生行政机关注意认真地团结中医，吸收中医参加人民卫生工作，并且研究和发展中国医药学中一切有用的成分。
    但由于我们卫生部门的各级领导过去对中医问题认识不够正确，团结中西医的工作仍然没有作好。中医在解放后的一个长时期内，仍旧在组织上和学术上遭受着歧视、排挤，所以有的中医说：
  “解放后人民翻了身，中医没翻身。”这种情形影响了中医的工作情绪，使他们在人民群众中未能发挥应有的医疗作用。这个责任要由我们卫生部门的各级领导来担负。
    我国现有六万万多人口，医药卫生事业的负担很重，而主观力量很小，因此，每个医务工作者应当坚决响应中国共产党的号召，做好中西医团结工作，以便共同去满足人民的需要和提高人民的体质。因此希望我们具有近代科学知识的医务卫生工作者首先伸出手来，学习中医历史，研究中医学术，关心中医业务。当然，要作好这些工作并不容易，但我以为负有保障人民健康和发展医学科学责任的各级卫生干部是有义务要求我们自己去这样做的。
    也许有人会怀疑中医的科学性究竟怎样？当然，中国原有医学并没有发展成为有系统的科学，其中包含着许多合乎科学的部分，也还包含着许多不科学的糟粕，但是我们的任务并不是要吸收这些糟粕，而是要吸收它的精华，即它的合乎科学的有实效的部分。为了达到这个目的，武断的空口赞扬和空口批评，都不是老实的负责任的态度。没有调查就没有发言权。我们必须团结各方面的科学家分
  工合作，实事求是地去作精密的调查研究，根据调查研究的客观结果来作出判断。否则，看不见中医中药的历史贡献，看不见几十万中医同人民的关系，盲目地去批判中医，这种态度本身就是不科学的。
    为了全中国人民的健康福利，为了正确对待祖国文化遗产，为了发展和提高我国的医学科学，我们所有的医务工作者，不论行政干部或技术专家，都要从思想上去认识团结中西医方针的重要性和正确性，并且有计划有步骤地加以贯彻。我希望中央卫生部不久就能在这一方面定出具体的办法来。
    章伯钧代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意和拥护周总理的政府工作报告。
    五年来，我国水路、公路运输事业，也同其他各个方面一样，是获得了不少成绩的。
    在水运方面：全国解放时，曾遭受蒋匪帮破坏劫夺。这几年，我们进行了修复新添工作。截至一九五三年底止，全国机动运输船舶吨位较一九四九年底已增加一倍以上。内河通航里程达九万五千余公里，其中通轮船的有三万余公里。沿海与长江各大港口及助航设备已大体恢复，浦口码头的整治、青岛二号码头的修复、黄埔港的第一期扩建工程和塘沽新港的第一期改建工程都已先后完成。主要内河和沿海干线运输以及各大、中海港，也已先后统一经营管理，并已逐步地统一了水运规章制度。同时，水路运输量也正在逐年增长，如国营沿海、长江、松花江货运量以一九五○年为一百，一九五三年货运量为百分之四百零八，货物周转量为百分之九百六十一。
    随着对外贸易的增长，远洋运输亦在逐步开展。目前有十七个国家的商船同我国通航。但由于美帝国主义和蒋匪帮的骚扰破坏，沿海和远洋运输受到很大阻挠。蒋贼劫夺了我国以及同我国通航的十一个国家的商船先后达七十多艘。为了发展我国的对外贸易和海上运输，我们坚决拥护解放台湾！
    在公路方面：截至一九五三年底止，修复新建公路四万余公里，全国公路通车里程达十三万八千五百余公里。新建的公路，大部在边疆和少数民族地区，其中有康藏、青藏、海南、昆洛、成阿等公路。而重点改建的，有西宁到玉树、上饶到福州等公路，这些公路对于发展西藏地方和西北、西南以及沿海地区的经济与文化，密切我国各族人民的联系，巩固祖国的国防，都是有极重要意义的。
    新建的康藏公路，从雅安到拉萨全长二千二百五十五公里，其中由马尼根果到拉萨一千五百六十七公里，中间经过十四座拔海三千公尺到五千公尺的大山，有些地段的积雪终年不化，筑路的员工须爬行在云层里和雪线上，有一百五十多座桥梁架在金沙江、澜沧江上游的悬岸深谷和惊涛急流上，这一切都挡不住我们筑路军工、民工、技工英雄们“一定要把公路修到西藏”的坚强意志。预计今年底可全线修通。
    五年来，地方交通运输事业，在地方各级党政领导和支持下，获得了一些成就。全国营业汽车经过大力整修和新添，车辆数字已达战前水平，并担负了逐年增长的运输任务。如地方国营汽车车数一九五三年较一九五○年仅增长百分之七十五点八九，而一九五三年货运量增加为百分之五百一十四，货物周转量增加为百分之四百。在地方交通工作中，我们依靠地方民力、财力，就地取材，发扬广大劳动人民修桥补路的优良传统，组织民工养护和整修公路，疏浚内河航道，修复桥梁渡船，并开辟了一部分当地人民迫切需要的道路；对广大分散的木帆船、兽力车个体运输业，进行了组织管理和整顿改革等工作。以上这些，对活跃农村经济与初级市场，都是起了重要作用的。
    对资本主义运输业进行了社会主义改造。我们采用公私合营和“统一配载、统一调度、统一运价”等形式，已分别地将私营运输业纳入国家计划的轨道。沿海和长江私营轮船业，均已公私合营。民生轮船公司自实行公私合营后，经过一系列的整顿改革，船舶载重量已提高了百分之二十七，增建和改建船舶一万五千吨，运量比过去提高一倍多，川江运输成本已降低百分之三十。
    五年来，水路、公路运输事业取得了很大成就，这是同中国共产党、毛主席和各级党政机关的领导，全国人民的支援，苏联专家的帮助，全体职工的努力，大批劳动模范、先进工作者的带头分不开的。
    但是，在我们各项工作中，也还存在着许多缺点和错误。在运输工作中，突出的缺点是运输成本高，效率低。如船只在港非生产性的停泊时间长，一般高达百分之五十到七十；回空、半载的情况严重；待修船只不能按时修好；港口人力装卸费用高；对仅有的机械设备利用不够；缺乏定员定额管理；而最主要的是只问生产不计成本的思想还严重，以及宽打窄用的保守思想和本位主义等。
    运输工作中另一严重缺点是：延误运送时间，货物损失和差错不断发生。如发生过夏季用的草帽子到冬季才运到，粮食霉烂、机器零件散失、错发运送地点等现象。而最严重的是海损事故，曾造成政治上、经济上的很大损失。这是由于领导上犯有严重的官僚主义，忽视贯彻安全生产统一的方针，没有建立起严格的责任制，对职工缺乏进行遵守操作规程的教育等。
    在基本建设工作中，由于忽视勘察设计工作的领导，勘察设计落后于施工，材料和机具供应不及时，施工管理混乱等，造成工程质量低劣，窝工待料，以及人力物力的很大浪费。同时，由于对全国情况和客观发展的需要调查研究不够，对如何恰当地使用国家有限的投资，少花钱，多做事这个道理，钻研不够，因而，造成了工作方面的盲目性。
    地方交通运输事业，息息关联着广大人民的物质生活和文化生活，它对农业的改造和农业生产力的提高，以及城乡物资交流都起着重大作用，它是国家整个运输系统不可缺少的一部分。几年来，全国各地和广大的人民群众十分关怀地方交通运输事业的发展，迫切要求修建道路，疏浚航道，增加运输工具。但是，由于我们存在着重视干线交通、轻视地方和民间交通，重视近代运输工具、轻视落后运输工具的思想，忽视各种运输的特有作用，对干线运输和面的短程运输如何衔接缺乏研究，总结与推广经验不够；同时也还由于国家处在重点建设时期，用于地方交通资金有限，因此，地方交通运输还不能适应人民的需要。特别在运输繁忙的线路，如兰州到乌鲁木齐、贵阳到金城江、上饶到福州等线路，由于汽车运力不足，货物和旅客积压待运，货主、旅客颇多不满。但在同时，许多机关、企业的专用货车，停歇、空驶的情况很严重，这样就出现了：一方面是汽车运输部门运力不足；一方面是机关、企业的车辆运力浪费很大，对国家说来很不经济。有的地方提出由汽车运输部门负责组织管理机关和企业的车辆，以补运力不足的办法，这是好的，但我们还没有加以研究和推广。
      我国水运具有丰富的天然水流资源，内河密布且常年不冻，海岸线长达一万二千公里。由于旧中国对水运事业很少建设，技术设备十分薄弱和落后；同时，由于我们对水运在交通运输业中的地位认识不足，以及利用水运可为国家节省投资体会不深，因而我国天然的水利资源和水路运输，还没有很好地利用起来。
    上述工作中的缺点和错误，去年和今年召开过的全国交通会议，曾集中地进行了检讨和批判，并已采取了若干具体措施，现正努力改进中。
    毛主席经常教导我们：努力学习经济建设的理论，努力学习苏联先进经验，努力钻研业务，使自己成为内行，避免错误。但是，几年来，我自己学得不深不透；对于关键性的业务问题，未能抓紧解决；对于下边工作情况，缺乏深入了解和研究，检查督促不够；因而工作中发生不少错误和损失，有负于国家、人民和毛主席的委托。
    我们完全相信：随着我国有计划地发展国民经济，特别是重工业、造船工业、汽车制造业和石油工业的建设，公路不断地扩大修筑，港口设备和内河航道的逐步改善，再加上各地人民群众对交通事业的积极性和大力支持，依靠全体职工再接再厉地努力工作，发扬成绩，克服缺点，纠正错误，可以预期：我国水路、公路交通运输事业，一定会相应地获得新的发展和取得更大的成就，逐步改善我国水路、公路运输事业的落后面貌，更好地适应工农业生产、商品流通，满足人民物质文化生活和国防建设的需要，为实现国家过渡时期的总任务而服务。
    刀京版代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我是从祖国边疆云南省来的傣族人民代表，我能够代表傣族人民，来参加全国人民代表大会第一次会议，感到无上的光荣！
      我完全拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告。几年来，我们傣族地区，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的英明领导下，在人民解放军和汉族干部的积极帮助下，肃清了境内残匪，建立了自治区和自治机关，实现了少数民族当家作主的权利。各民族间和民族内部建立了团结友爱的新关系。因而使祖国边疆出现了空前未有的巩固和安定。由于上级人民政府大力帮助我们发展生产，各族人民生活开始得到了改善。去年德宏傣族景颇族自治区修筑了大盈江河堤，使一百零三个村庄的人民和三万多亩稻田免除了洪灾。文化教育也有了显著的发展，一九五○年到一九五三年，德宏傣族景颇族自治区的小学校，已由十五所增加到一百一十五所，学生人数也增长了十倍。各族人民普遍受到免费治疗和预防注射，疾病和死亡大大地减少了。由于人民政府又修筑了通往边疆的公路，大力开展贸易工作，昆明至西双版纳傣族自治区的公路修通了。今年上半年，西双版纳地区的国营贸易销售额，就等于一九五○年全年的六十多倍，等于一九五三年同一时期的百分之三百二十七点八。茶叶产量今年为一九四九年的五倍半。过去农民要用十二斤以上的大米，才能换得一斤食盐，现在只要三斤大米就可以换到一斤盐了。
      几年来，我们深切体验到，只有中国共产党和毛主席的领导，汉族人民的帮助，我们少数民族才能得到解放，才能得到发展，才能逐步过渡到幸福、美满的社会主义社会。
    建设社会主义社会，是我国各族人民的共同目标，是我国各族人民的共同利益，因此我们傣族地区也要同全国一样，进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造，而在社会主义改造的问题上，我完全同意刘少奇委员关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告中所提到的方针和道路，根据宪法的规定，按照大多数人民群众和与群众有联系的领袖人物的意愿去进行。
    在我们地区，当前还有一些缺点，如自治区人民政府对于培养各少数民族干部，对本地民族干部进行爱国主义教育，帮助他们树立当家作主思想和虚心向先进民族学习、欢迎先进民族干部的帮助的精神，都是重视不够的。我们主动地向上级反映情况，积极争取上级的领导和帮助也做得差。此外到边疆地区去工作的汉族干部中，绝大多数是积极负责，努力工作，全心全意为边疆各族人民服务的；但也有少数不尊重少数民族干部职权，不尊重少数民族风俗习惯，不根据民族特点办事的现象。这些缺点，对于自治权利的充分实现和各种工作都是有害的，在过去，我们曾经不断地克服过，相信今后在共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的领导下，我们一定能够逐步克服掉的。
    我们是处在祖国的西南边疆，美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石匪帮，还企图在那里进行其挑拨破坏活动。我们一定要提高警惕，紧密地团结在共产党、人民政府和毛主席的周围，团结在伟大的祖国大家庭里，为巩固祖国国防，为支援解放台湾、为保卫建设我们伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗！
    田华代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意并衷心拥护周总理的政府工作报告。五年来，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，我们祖国的政治、经济、文化建设获得了巨大的成就，国际地位一天天提高，生活和成长在这样伟大的时代、伟大的国家，使我感到有说不出的骄傲。
    我是一个年轻的演员，但我是这样的幸福。当我幼小的时候，共产党的光辉，就照亮了我所生长的落后的农村。我在人民解放军中经历了伟大的人民革命斗争，看到了它的胜利。现在，社会主义、共产主义又在向我招手，我将看到它的实现。历史车轮加速了，它充实和丰富了我们的生命，使我的一生，顶得上我们祖先的几生，而它的光辉灿烂，是他们做梦也梦不到的。
    我是党抚育教养成人的。我记得很深刻，当人民解放军的抗日的大旗飘扬在晋察冀边区，我参加了儿童团。在我站岗的那一天，晋察冀抗战剧社来到我们村里演出，我爱慕他们那种战斗、紧张、活泼的生活，我报名参军了。从此我受到了党的直接抚育和伟大的人民革命斗争的锻炼。党教育我热爱人民，我从可歌可泣的人民革命斗争的实践中，体验了劳动人民的痛苦和喜悦，以及他们的勤劳、朴实、坚忍不拔的高贵品质，这种崇高的理性和情感，鼓励了我去表演和创造中国人民的伟大形象。
    我在病中，同志们告诉我当选为全国人民代表大会代表，我是怎样的激动，像我这样一个穷乡僻壤的孩子，做了一些平凡的工作，居然当选为全国人民代表大会代表，我做梦也没有想过。然而我终于镇定下来了。我生活在人民的时代，这已经不是梦想，而是现实。我假如有一点微小的成就，那是党的光荣，人民的光荣。人民爱护我，这是对我的鼓励。我还很幼稚，但我决不气馁，我将把人民的鼓励变成新的勇气和力量，百倍努力于演员工作，来歌颂太阳一般的共产党和毛泽东，来表达人民为社会主义奋斗的坚强意志和向往社会主义幸福生活的渴望。
    我当然也有我的具体希望。我希望剧作家们能够在毛主席文艺方针的光辉照耀下，创造更多的作品，特别是创造人民中国新型妇女的伟大形象的作品，写她们在政治、经济、文化各个革命战线上的光荣的斗争，写她们英勇顽强、热爱祖国、热爱劳动、热爱社会主义的高贵品质，使全中国妇女从种种落后思想的束缚下真正解放出来，成为社会主义建设的一支大军。我作为一个人民时代抚育成长起来的年轻女演员，同所有的女演员一样，渴望着可能来发挥我们的表演才能，提高我们的表演艺术水平，这是很自然的，可以理解的。
    第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，是中国人民政治生活的里程碑，它也将是我国经济、文化新的高涨的里程碑。我预祝我们可爱的祖国国防巩固，经济繁荣，文化昌盛。
    熊克武代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我以无限兴奋的心情，参加这次历史性的会议。对于周恩来总理的政府工作报告，我感到十分满意，建议大会通过这个报告。
    中华人民共和国成立仅仅五年，由于中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的正确领导，我们的国家已经起了根本的变化。我在西南参加地方行政工作，感觉得特别深切。就四川来说，它向来是国内最顽固的封建堡垒。到了蒋介石反动统治时期，封建暴政之上又加上了法西斯恐怖，整个四川成了暗无天日的地狱。解放后，经过清匪反霸、土地改革等一系列的斗争，我亲眼看到这座封建堡垒，被人民彻底摧毁了。过去的四川是盗匪如毛，民不聊生，今天的四川已经是“夜不闭户，路不拾遗”了。
    五年来，西南在国民经济建设方面，同样有辉煌的成就。工农业生产都超过了历史上的最高水平。旧有的工业都恢复了，发展了；新建的工业，纷纷出现，有许多已投入生产了。农业的生产量也是一年比一年地上升。由于气候好、互助合作运动的发展、农民的生产积极性提高等，四川今年仍然丰收，政府号召增产百分之六的指标，已经完成。四川农民为了支援国家工业建设和省外灾区，现正紧张劳动，增种红苕、洋芋等以便供给自己吃，又可腾出多余的粮食卖给国家。西南在交通建设上的成就也是巨大的：四川人民渴望了四十多年的成渝铁路，通车已有两年多，宝成铁路已通车到江油，成昆铁路也将勘测完毕了。值得特别指出的：从世界屋脊上修筑起来的康藏公路，在今年内就可通车到拉萨；昆洛公路和成阿公路，同样是从内地通向边疆的艰巨工程，昆洛公路通车过了允景洪，成阿公路在今年底可以全部完工。这对于巩固祖国西陲国防，帮助各兄弟民族的经济和文化建设的发展，都将起极重要的作用。
    但是五年来，西南地方政权的工作也是有缺点的。据我在工作岗位上所见到的，中央颁布的法令、政策，都是正确的。可是有些地方执行起来，就有时不免有些粗糙。例如粮食统购统销的政策，这肯定是正确的；但是西南在执行过程中，个别的地方，却有时不尽切合实际，对于应该多购的反而购得少，应该少购的反而购得多；同样，在销售的时候，不该买的卖给他了，该买的人又买不到手，因而引起有些农民的不满情绪。这是由于事前分析情况不够细致、交代政策不够明确的原故。我希望政府今后对于干部教育和群众宣传的工作，进一步加强起来，保证正确的政策得到完全正确的执行。
    五年来，西南人民在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，获得的成就是巨大的；但从我个人来说，却又感到十分的惭愧。我自参加辛亥革命、推翻满清帝制以后，由于当时没有明确的革命方向，我所领导的军队，曾在四川打了十多年的内战。自认为这是贯彻辛亥革命的政治主张，结果反而使地方人民遭受了灾害。解放以后，我担任西南行政方面的重要职务，同时还负责民主党派的工作，这对我个人是何等的荣幸。但因我受了旧社会的感染，解放后学习又不够；故在具体问题上，理论和实际总不容易密切地结合起来，因而对于人民革命事业应起的带头推动作用，也就表现得很不够。由于共产党不断的教育我，群众不断地帮助我，通过长期的新旧思想的斗争，我的认识逐渐有所提高，这当然还是非常不够的。现在，我光荣地当了全国人民代表大会代表，今后决定在中国共产党的领导下和人民群众的监督下，进一步加强学习，努力工作，争取尽到作为一个人民代表应尽的职责。
    中华人民共和国宪法已经公布了。中国人民有了这个新的战斗武器，今后一定能够取得更大更多的胜利。我们紧握着这个武器，在伟大的毛泽东的旗帜下，向着繁荣幸福的社会主义社会迈步前进。
    车向忱代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意和拥护周总理的政府工作报告。
    过去几年来，由于中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的正确领导，我国人民在进行各项社会改革、抗美援朝、恢复和发展国民经济等方面都获得了辉煌的成就，教育工作也有显著的发展和提高。就东北的教育工作来说，根据一九五三年统计，全区共有五百九十多万小学生、四十三万多中学生，大大地超过了东北过去任何时期的学生数。工农子女就学比重逐年增多，现在在小学生中已占百分之八十以上，在中学生中已占百分之七十三以上。在发展的同时，中、小学校还进行了初步的教学改革和政治思想教育工作。但是，我认为我们学校教育工作还存在着不少缺点和错误，主要是对提高学校教育的质量注意不够，有贪多冒进的偏向。自从中央人民政府提出“整顿巩固、重点发展、提高质量、稳步前进”的方针之后，虽然有了改进，但在提高质量方面尚未取得应有的进步，特别是小学和中学，有些教员水平低，教学效果不高，仍然是一个严重问题。同时，学校教育还存在着不注意劳动教育的现象，有些从事教育工作的人员，尚有陈旧的教育观点，认为学生上学，只有升学才是正常的，而在中学、小学毕业后从事劳动或就业，却认为非常可惜甚至不光荣的。“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”的错误思想，在广大群众和许多学生中，还有很深的影响。因此有些学生毕业之后，因为升不了学，就对政府不满，这主要是由于不重视劳动教育和在学校建设中缺少计划性所造成的。
    中华人民共和国成立之初，各地学生的健康情况是很不好的，疾病率很大，这是旧社会反动统治阶级给我们遗留下来的恶果。自从毛主席提出“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”和“身体好、学习好、工作好”的号召之后，各学校、厂矿、部队、机关都开始注意开展体育运动，因而使得广大人民，首先是广大青年的健康情况有了显著的好转。但从东北来看，我们贯彻毛主席的指示和方针还很不够，有些学校，因功课太重，影响学生的健康，在大、中学校中有些学生患有神经衰弱病，有的为了升学，一面预备功课，一面吃药；有的学生在毕业之后，因为体质不好，不能胜任愉快地工作，这的确是个严重现象。在开展体育运动中的缺点，首先是对体育运动重视不够、宣传不够。有些干部不愿从事体育工作，甚至本来是学体育的人，也不愿搞这个行道。其次是各级领导上，未能认真贯彻群众路线，不少地方对群众性的体育运动的开展缺乏经常的推动和指导，这样就使体育运动未能获得广泛深入的开展。
    关于今后学校教育和体育运动，我们应当遵照宪法第九十四条的规定和周总理报告的精神，将青年培养成为全面发展的社会主义社会的建设者和保卫者。在学校教育工作方面，必须进一步贯彻“整顿巩固、重点发展、提高质量、稳步前进”的方针，加强学校建设的计划性，反对主观主义和分散主义，彻底克服盲目发展的倾向，特别要注意提高学校教育质量，首先是要大力提高教师质量。各级教育行政部门，除应有计划地培养与提高现有教师外，对培养新师资和团结老教师的工作应当加强起来，以适应工作发展的需要。在所有学校中，必须大力加强政治思想领导，在各科教学和课外活动中，都要注意贯彻社会主义的思想教育，特别要注意贯彻劳动教育，克服忽视劳动教育的错误倾向。
    在开展体育运动方面，必须加强宣传工作，贯彻群众路线，充实和健全领导体育运动的工作机构，克服形式主义，正确实行“劳卫制”，把毛主席关于“三好”的指示，切实贯彻到所有学校、厂矿、部队、机关和广大群众中去。
    茅以升代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    生在毛泽东时代的中国人民是幸福的。作为这样幸福人民的代表，来参加全国人民代表大会会议更是光荣，因而也负有格外重要的责任。我们一定要从今后的实际行动中，表示我们是如何慎重地在大会上完成了我们的任务，并且表示我们对宪法的拥护，对政府的信任和对领袖的热爱。
    我是一个技术科学工作者。我认为我们的宪法是一部伟大的科学文献，它完全以中国事实为根据，循着社会发展的规律，指出中国人民应走的道路。这是全中国群众智慧的集中表现。这正是科学态度、科学方法，因而我们的宪法就必然能够彻底实施，达到预期的目的。我又认为我们政府五年来的工作，所以能在各方面取得辉煌成就，也是同重视科学和技术的实事求是的精神分不开的。政府工作最突出的表现是争取完成一切预定的计划，而且时常超额地完成。这在中国历史上是空前的。这正是社会主义类型的政治制度的优越性的表现，而社会主义是建筑在技术高度发展的基础上的。我完全同意并且拥护刘少奇委员和周总理的报告。我能参加制宪工作，能在政府一个部门的工作岗位上，贡献出我所有的技术，真是无上光荣。
    在这里，我不能不回想到解放前的黑暗混乱景象。那时我们技术科学工作者，脱离群众，经常转业，不是为反动统治装饰门面，就是直接间接为帝国主义服务。今天看来，实是万分惭愧。但是中国一解放，在新事物的面前，我们的政治觉悟，就都有了进一步的提高。首先是学习了马克思列宁主义和毛泽东著作，理解到科学属于人民，科学技术应为人民服务。其次，在工作中，逐步深入群众，认识到不同工人结合，就一事无成。同时，在技术上接触到苏联的先进科学，得到莫大启示，也提高了科学水平。所有这些，都是我们能在政府工作里有所贡献的基本原因。我们所以能这样地为人民服务，能因这样服务而日有进步，都是由于共产党的教育和爱护。我们对共产党和毛主席的感激，是越来越深的。
    在宪法指出的国家总任务里，我们技术科学工作者负有比以前更加重要的责任。我们要同工人们一道，把旧中国遗留下来的落后的技术，改造为新的先进的技术，来提高劳动生产率，加速国家的社会主义工业化。我们特别要在全国性的技术革新运动中，贡献出更大的力量。然而，我们过去的工作，是落后于要求的。最显著的是对工人群众的合理化建议和创造发明未能做好科学总结，在理论上对他们的帮助不多。这是由于我们对现场缺乏了解，同工人们的团结不够密切，而自己的集体力量也未能充分发挥。同时，在学习苏联先进经验方面，还不能很好掌握，因而在结合实际时，有时感到无从下手。我们必须改正这些缺点，这是我们今后主观努力的方向。
    五年来，由于我们在各方面获得了伟大的胜利，祖国在国际上的地位有了空前的提高。然而我们科学地位，虽在一日千里的经济建设推动下，却仍然远远跟不上。正当国家实施总任务时，而科学却是一个薄弱的环节，这是个严重问题。现在各地高等学校都在蓬勃发展，几年以后，科学技术人才当然大大增多，然而一定还是不能满足需要的。我们要建设一个六万万人的社会主义国家，实是极其艰难的伟大任务，我们必须充分发挥一切潜在力量，来加强科学工作，来提高技术基础。
    现在我提出几点意见，请大家指正：
    （一）技术人员的培养，不能专靠正规学校，特别在最近几年的青黄不接时期。我们应当在各种生产企业内推行多种多样的技术补习教育，在不脱离生产的条件下，普遍提高职工们的科学和技术的水平。在这里，我愿特别提出函授教育的重要性；在师资和教材缺乏的情况下，这种分布在全国技术系统的，从实践到理论的函授教育方法，是非常迫切需要的。
    （二）在生产建设中，技术问题非常之多，因而各种科学研究试验机构，陆续成立，当然是很好的现象。然而由于缺乏整体的计划和组织，就已经出现了重复浪费的现象；而某些急切需要的科学工作，反倒无人负责。在目前人才设备都感缺乏的时候，如何改善这种情况，是值得考虑的。近年来，各种科学的专门学会，进行了大量的学术活动，对于科学研究，起了相当作用。在这里，有两个问题感到困难：一是各学会会员的学术活动，虽然都同业务有关，而在活动所需的时间上还不免要受到工作机关的限制；二是会员在交流经验、讨论学术时，联系到实际，就不免要遇到保密问题，因而不知如何措手。这两点都希望政府予以具体规定。
    （三）作为人民团体的科学技术普及协会，近年来在全国范围内，有了很大发展。但普及教育要有实物表演的帮助，希望中央各企业部门，在国内国外举行各种展览会以后，能将技术展览品移交普及协会整理保管，充分利用，以便逐步建立经常展览的科学技术馆。
    （四）全国科学工作，从科学研究到科学普及，要有周密计划，把生产、教育和研究三方面的科学力量组织起来，联系交流，分工合作，更好地为生产建设服务。我们科学工作中的医药卫生事业，因同在一个全国性的系统之下，再加群众性的爱国卫生运动，就能日有进步，工矿企业的科学工作，也需要一个全国性的联系各方的科学工作网，来组织技术力量，推广技术成果，来配合群众性的技术革新运动，我们才能保障并促进技术的健康，如同保障和促进人体健康一样。
    我们伟大的宪法，已经庄严地通过了。其中规定的国家鼓励公民在劳动中的积极性和创造性，鼓励和帮助公民进行科学研究等条文，对于祖国科学事业的发展，将有无穷的推动力量。在我们伟大的宪法的光辉照耀下，在我们的伟大领袖毛主席领导下，我们技术科学工作者，一定同全国人民一道，努力学习，积极工作，为祖国的社会主义建设，为世界和平和人类进步的崇高目的而奋斗！
    蒋南翔代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意并衷心拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告。举世公认：中华人民共和国成立以来，我国各方面的工作都获得了伟大成就。作为一个高等学校的工作人员，我深切地体验到新中国的高等教育，在中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，是以多么巨大的速度在前进。
    在国民党反动统治时期，我国的高等学校不是也不可能针对全国人民的实际需要来进行教育工作。那时学校教育是同社会生活脱节的，并且是服务于反动的统治阶级的。那时高等学校的教师，没有学术研究的自由。那时高等学校的学生，在学校里不能学到为人民服务的知识，毕业后不能获得为人民服务的机会，笼罩着他们的是政治上的迫害，失业的威胁。那时的工农青年根本被剥夺了接受高等教育的机会。
    新中国的高等学校完全是另外一种情况。
    现在我国每一个高等学校，都担负了为国家培养社会主义建设干部的光荣的任务，每一个高等学校的教师和工作人员，都是以主人翁的地位，自觉地为人民服务。现在的问题决不是怕大学毕业生失业，恰恰相反，只是感到大学毕业生太少，还远赶不上国家的需要。高等学校中工农青年的入学人数，也在逐年增长。现在全国设立了许多工农速成中学，这为工农青年的进入高等学校，创造了最有利的条件。我国伟大的社会主义建设事业，最有力地推动了我国高等教育的发展。
    以清华大学为例，解放以前，全校学生只有二千余人。现在清华大学有学生五千五百人，相当解放以前学生人数的两倍半。再过几年，清华大学的学生将发展到一万以上，就是说，那时的学生人数将为解放以前的五倍。现在全国其他高等学校，同样也都以很大的规模在迅速发展。这种情况，充分反映了我国高等教育事业的蓬勃发展，这在旧中国是不能设想的。
    我国高等教育的飞跃进步，不但表现在数量的发展上，更重要的还表现在各学校内部的教学改革上。教学改革最主要的内容，就是学习苏联经验；就是根据国家建设事业的需要来设置各学校的专业，根据各专业的需要来制订教学计划和教学大纲，有计划地进行全部教学工作；就是结合中国实际情况采用苏联高等学校的教材，向学生介绍最先进的科学技术知识；就是有步骤地、有系统地学习苏联高等学校的教学制度和教学方法，加强马克思列宁主义的政治教育，加强理论同实践的联系，努力提高学生的社会主义觉悟和独立工作能力。
    两年来教学改革的实际经验，完全证实了苏联社会主义教育制度的极大优越性。学习苏联经验的结果，使我国高等学校发生了深刻的内部变化，大大提高了教育质量。学习苏联经验的结果，使历史上深受美国帝国主义思想毒害的清华大学，抛弃了英美资产阶级的反动的教育传统，大踏步走上社会主义的发展轨道。
    我们深深地感觉到，毛主席关于“学习苏联”的伟大号召，对于我国高等教育的改革，具有特别重大的意义。不学习苏联经验，我们不但不可能迅速地建立起真正近代化的工厂，同样也不可能迅速地建立起真正先进的高等学校。我国高等学校教学改革的过程，同时也就是有步骤地系统地学习苏联经验的过程。
    在中央人民政府高等教育部的领导和苏联专家的热忱帮助下，我国高等学校在学习苏联方面已经获得了很大成绩。但是还应当指出我们在学习苏联的工作上还有缺点，比较严重的缺点就是形式主义。有这样的情况：在形式上，已采用了苏联高等学校的某些新制度、新课程、新教材，但在实际内容上，却改变很少，行的是老一套，讲的是旧内容。也有这样情况：认为学习苏联可以不考虑和研究中国的实际情况；可以不顾时间、地点和条件，只要把苏联现成的规章制度照搬过来，就可在中国学校中同样加以推行。这种不实事求是的作法，自然就不能获得良好的结果。为了使我们的工作能够获得更快的进步，学习苏联的形式主义的倾向，是应该防止和克服的。
    我们深深地感觉到，学习苏联先进教育经验，在我国是社会主义教育思想对于资产阶级教育思想的一种革命，也是高等学校知识分子思想改造的继续和深入。因此必须把苏联的经验同我国过渡时期的具体情况正确地结合起来，必须在我国高等学校的全部工作中、日益深入地贯彻马克思列宁主义的领导，只有在日益强大的巩固的马克思列宁主义的思想政治基础上，才能建立和发展高度的社会主义的科学技术，才能胜利地完成我国高等学校的教育改革。
    为国家培养社会主义的建设人才，这是光荣的艰巨的任务。在我自己来说，知识和经验都非常不够，远远不能适应工作的要求。我们一定要遵照毛主席的指示，老老实实，勤勤恳恳，努力学习自己不懂的东西，力戒任何的虚夸和骄傲。我们一定要在共产党和人民政府的正确领导下，努力克服各种困难，克服自己工作中的缺点和错误，为完成国家交给我们的任务而奋斗！
    柯庆施代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意和拥护刘少奇委员和周恩来总理的报告。
    这次会议通过的中华人民共和国宪法和刘少奇委员、周恩来总理的报告，正确地总结了中国人民革命斗争和各方面工作的丰富经验，表达了全国人民建设社会主义新生活的愿望和要求，指出了全国人民奋斗的方向，给予全国人民以巨大的鼓舞和力量。这次大会将以中国人民的团结一致，决意为建设一个伟大的社会主义国家的光辉一页记载在历史上。
    在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛泽东主席的英明领导之下，全国人民为着逐步实现国家过渡时期的总任务正在奋勇前进。江苏省的人民也同其他地区人民一样，有了很大的成就。建省近两年来，工农业生产已经有了很大发展，一九五三年全省工业生产总值较一九五二年增加了百分之二十点八，一九五四年工业计划较一九五三年要增加百分之九点一。在农业生产上，一九五三年全年粮食总产量较一九五二年增加百分之八点二，较解放初期的一九四九年已增产百分之七十六点六。人民的物质生活和文化生活，几年来在生产提高的基础上也有了不少的改善。国家对农业、对手工业、对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造工作也在不断的前进。文教、卫生工作也相应地得到发展和改进。从江苏一省的情况来看，也使我们体会到周总理报告中所列举的中国人民几年来所获得的成就是如何的伟大。
    建设社会主义新生活，已成为广大人民普遍而热烈的愿望。广大的工人、农民正在一锤一锤地、一锄一锄地从事伟大的建设工程。特别是在逐步实现国家在过渡时期的总任务的有力号召和它的光芒照耀之下，江苏省工人的劳动积极性和创造性在不断提高。广大的农民今年与洪水作了艰苦的战斗，使得三千余万亩被淹农田中的二千三百余万亩胜利地完成了排水、补种或改种工作，在未受灾地区开展着增产丰收的运动。经过这些努力，已经使得江苏今年的农业生产，基本上战胜了灾害，完全有可能完成今年原定的生产计划。各种互助合作运动正在飞速发展，在其他战线上也获得了显著的进步，显示了广大人民社会主义觉悟的提高和巨大的创造力量。全国人民社会主义觉悟的不断提高，将使任何帝国主义、反革命分子不能阻挡我们的前进！
    人民的胜利总是值得歌颂的。但是我们的任务是在于为逐步实现国家在过渡时期的总任务而不断前进。要前进就必须认识我们前进途中还存在着许多需要克服的困难，要毫不含糊地注视我们工作中的缺点，并不断地克服这些缺点。
    从江苏省的工作来看，以下几条教训，特别值得我们注意：
    第一，在工作中真正贯彻毛主席指示的实事求是、从实际出发的精神感到不够。例如在工、农业生产工作中有时缺乏周密调查研究，不根据工作的特点，不找出问题的关键，凭着主观办事。又如江苏省境内治淮工程对今年的大水起了拦洪蓄水的重大作用，我们的水利工程成绩是很大的；可是，今年经历过洪水的考验，就看出有个别工程的设计，仅仅机械地以历史的资料作标准（这些资料本身就不是完全的），却没有周密地考虑到几十年来变化的因素（如河床、雨期长短、下雨区域等）。这种主观主义的工作作风是很坏事的，需要我们以很大的努力来克服。
    第二，我们还有一些业务工作存在着脱离政治的倾向。有些同志还不懂得任何业务工作都是服务于社会主义建设和社会主义改造的，它首先是一个政治问题。因此，常常产生缺少从政治上考虑、仅仅从技术上或业务上去解决问题的片面观点，不是从教育干部和发动群众、依靠群众自觉完成任务出发的片面观点。有些工作，传达到下面，只剩下两个数字，一个是任务多少，一个是几时完成。这样就会使对广大群众有复杂关系的问题，不能完全得到正确而必要的处理，以致有时使得群众的积极性、创造性的发挥受到限制。
    第三，对干部和广大人民群众的社会主义思想教育必须紧密地结合社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的前进而深入地进行，不能有任何中断。建设社会主义社会不仅是艰巨的经济斗争和政治斗争，也是艰巨的思想斗争。有些人对这一点认识不足，不了解只有不断地克服那些唯利是图的个人主义、骄傲自满情绪和工作中的落后保守思想、盲目冒进思想，我们的事业才能前进。
    对广大人民群众来说，教育他们脱离落后思想影响，尤其是长期的工作。我们有些同志常常把以社会主义思想教育干部和人民的工作当作一次突击运动，满足于已取得的成就，不继续研究群众思想状况，不作艰苦的说服教育工作，这是许多工作产生缺点的一个很大的原因。
    克服各种主观主义的思想作风和工作作风，加强业务工作与政治工作的正确结合，加强在群众中经常的宣传教育工作和组织工作，不断地提高干部和人民群众的社会主义思想觉悟，充分发扬群众的积极性和创造性，才能使我们的工作避免错误或减少错误。
    最后让我们牢牢地记住毛主席在开幕词中的指示。我们要紧紧地团结在中国共产党的周围，我们要努力地掌握马克思列宁主义的思想武器，我们要戒骄戒躁，克服困难，坚决前进。我们一定要将我们的国家建设成为一个伟大的社会主义共和国，我们一定能够将我们的国家建设成为一个伟大的社会主义共和国。
