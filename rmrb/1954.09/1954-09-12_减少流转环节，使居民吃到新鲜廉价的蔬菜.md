Reducing Circulation Links to Allow Residents to Eat Fresh and Inexpensive Vegetables
    Zhu Ping, Wang Hui

    In the past, there were many links in the vegetable supply in Beijing. Every morning, suburban farmers transported vegetables to the three major vegetable distribution markets—Tianqiao, Fuchengmen, and Guang'anmen—or other small and medium-sized vegetable markets. Then, through the introduction of the vegetable market organizers—supply and marketing cooperative vegetable stations and private vegetable firms—farmers sold the vegetables to purchasing units, vegetable merchants, and consumer cooperatives. Sometimes, some vegetable merchants and vendors did not directly buy vegetables at the market, but bought them from other vegetable merchants and vendors, which added another link. Therefore, it was calculated that, apart from institutions, organizations, troops, and industrial and mining enterprises that managed food, which could directly purchase vegetables in bulk from large vegetable markets, a vegetable typically went through two or three hands, or even more, from the farmer to the citizen. Each intermediary would at least extract 10 percent of the profit, which meant that the price citizens bought was at least 20 to 30 percent higher than the price farmers sold. Moreover, after so many hands, repeated handling, and losses, the vegetables were not fresh.

    The Dongdan District Consumer Cooperative in Beijing supplied daily vegetables to the vast majority of residents in the vicinity through its 14 non-staple food supply stations and distribution points. In the past, the staff of the cooperative's vegetable supply department had to rush to the three major vegetable markets of Tianqiao, Guang'anmen, and Fuchengmen before dawn to purchase vegetables. Sometimes, when they returned late, people would already be lining up to buy vegetables at each supply station and distribution point. Some people, impatient with waiting, would simply go to the vegetable merchants to buy vegetables. When the consumer cooperative bought vegetables at the market, it also had to go through the introduction of the supply and marketing cooperative vegetable stations or private vegetable firms in the market, because the vegetable stations and private vegetable firms had some personnel to manage the market, so they needed to charge a handling fee of 4.5 to 6.5 percent (6.5 percent for private vegetable firms) from the buyers. In this way, the Dongdan District Consumer Cooperative not only had to pay a certain handling fee when purchasing vegetables in the market, but also had to hire pedicabs to allocate the vegetables from the market to each supply station and distribution point after buying them, which added about 25 yuan per catty of vegetables in transportation costs, plus losses on the way, so the price of vegetables was naturally more expensive.

    The purchasing staff of the consumer cooperative had long felt very troubled by this problem, but could not think of a good solution. In June of this year, they studied the method of Beijing Supply and Marketing Cooperative signing vegetable production and sales combination contracts with agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs, and with the assistance of Tianqiao Vegetable Station, the Dongdan District Consumer Cooperative signed a vegetable production and sales combination contract with Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiaohongmen Township, Nanyuan District. It was stipulated that the consumer cooperative would submit a vegetable demand plan every three days, and the agricultural production cooperative would deliver the vegetables to the consumer cooperative the night before according to the plan. If there were not enough of a certain vegetable, the consumer cooperative would purchase it in the market in a planned way; if there was a surplus of a certain vegetable, the agricultural production cooperative would take it to the market to sell itself. The price of vegetables was based on the Tianqiao market the next morning. In this way, the consumer cooperative could distribute the vegetables to each supply station every night. Some supply stations on the delivery route of the agricultural production cooperative could also unload nearby.

    After the contract was signed, not only was there a reliable guarantee of vegetable sources, but the planning of the cooperative's supply and marketing business was also strengthened. It not only changed the phenomenon of queuing to buy vegetables in the past, but also allowed citizens to eat fresh vegetables. At the same time, due to the reduction of commodity circulation links, the price of vegetables was also reduced. Now, the vegetables that citizens buy from supply stations or distribution points are generally about 10 percent cheaper than in the past. If compared with vegetable merchants and vendors, they are much cheaper. Therefore, most of the citizens near Dongdan District go to the supply stations or distribution points of Dongdan District Consumer Cooperative to buy vegetables, and the cooperative's business has also expanded accordingly. The supply of vegetables has increased from more than 10,000 catties per day to more than 20,000 catties.

    Recently, in order to meet the needs of the vast majority of citizens, the Dongdan District Consumer Cooperative has successively signed production and sales combination contracts with the Third Agricultural Production Cooperative of Taipingqiao Township in Fengtai District and the Dongbianmen Agricultural Production Cooperative in the eastern suburbs.

    减少流转环节，使居民吃到新鲜廉价的蔬菜
    竹平　王辉
    过去，北京市蔬菜供应的环节是很多的：每天早晨，郊区菜农把蔬菜运到天桥、阜成门、广安门三大蔬菜集散市场或其他中小蔬菜市场上，然后，经过蔬菜市场的组织者——供销合作社菜站和私营菜行的介绍，菜农再把蔬菜卖给采购单位和菜商、菜贩及消费合作社，有时，有些菜商、菜贩并不直接到市场买蔬菜，而是通过其他菜商、菜贩转手买来的，这就又增加了一道环节。因此，计算起来，除机关、团体、部队、工矿企业管伙食的单位能够直接地、成批地从大的蔬菜市场购进以外，通常一种蔬菜从菜农手里转到市民手里，要经过两三道手，有时还要多些。每转一道手，居间者至少要从中获取百分之十的利润，这就是说，市民买进的价格至少要比菜农卖出的价格贵百分之二三十。而且经过这么多道手，重重折磨、损耗，蔬菜也不新鲜。
    北京市东单区消费合作社通过它所属的十四个副食品供应站和分销处，供应着附近广大市民的日用蔬菜。过去，该社蔬菜供应部的工作同志，总是天还没亮就得跑到天桥、广安门、阜成门三大菜市去采购，有时回来晚了，各供应站、分销处买菜的人就排队了，有的等得不耐烦，就干脆跑到菜商那里去买。消费合作社到市场上买菜，也要经过菜市上的供销合作社菜站或私营菜行的介绍，因为菜站和私营菜行都有一部分人员来经营管理市场，所以在介绍买菜时就需要向买菜人收百分之四点五到百分之六点五（私营菜行是百分之六点五）的手续费。这样，东单区消费合作社在市场采购蔬菜不仅要支付一定的手续费，而且把菜买齐之后，还要雇三轮车分别从市场调拨给各供应站和分销处，合计每斤菜得加上二十五元左右的运费，再加上路途上的损耗，菜价自然就要贵了。
    消费合作社的采购员对这个问题早就感到非常头痛，但却想不出个好办法来。今年六月，他们学习了北京市供销合作总社与郊区各农业生产合作社订了蔬菜产销结合合同的办法，并在天桥菜站的协助下，东单区消费合作社与南苑区小红门乡红光农业生产合作社签订了蔬菜产销结合合同。规定每三天由消费合作社提出一次用菜计划，农业生产合作社则根据计划在前一天晚上把菜送到消费合作社。如果某种菜不够，消费合作社就有计划地到市场去采购；如果某种菜有多余，农业生产合作社就自己拿到市场去卖。菜价是按第二天早晨天桥市场为准。这样，每天晚上消费合作社就能把菜分送给各供应站。有的供应站在农业生产合作社送菜路线上的，还可就近卸下。
    合同签订后，不仅菜源有了可靠的保证，合作社供销业务的计划性也加强了，不但改变了过去排队买菜的现象，市民还能吃到新鲜的蔬菜。同时，由于减少了商品流转环节，也就降低了蔬菜的价格，现在，市民从供应站或分销处买来的蔬菜，一般都比过去便宜百分之十左右，如果比起菜商、菜贩，那就更便宜得多了。因此，东单区附近的市民，大都到东单区消费合作社的各供应站或分销处去买菜，合作社的业务也随之扩大了，蔬菜的供应量已由过去每天一万多斤增到了两万多斤。
    最近，东单区消费合作社为了适应广大市民的需要，又和丰台区太平桥乡第三农业生产合作社、东郊区东便门农业生产合作社陆续签订了产销结合合同。（附图片）
