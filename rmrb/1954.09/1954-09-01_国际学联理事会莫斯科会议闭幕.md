    From the 21st to the 24th, the meeting discussed the report made by the General Secretary of the ISU, Belyakov, on "The Tasks of the ISU and Further Consolidating International Student Cooperation." During the discussion, representatives and observers from student organizations of various countries spoke enthusiastically, expressing their support for the ISU's activities aimed at safeguarding student interests and enhancing student friendship.

This type of membership imposes limited obligations on the members, not exceeding the scope of their own constitutions. Their rights and obligations are specifically stipulated by special agreements between the ISU Executive Committee and individual student groups. This form of membership enables student groups from various countries to cooperate with the ISU on issues within their jurisdiction. The meeting on the 26th unanimously adopted the acceptance as associate members of the National Union of Students of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the National Union of South Africa, and the Israeli Student Union. It also adopted the agreement between the ISU and the Federation of French Higher Education Organizations on cooperation in the next academic year.

The meeting discussed various important aspects of the international student movement, as well as steps and methods for expanding cooperation among students worldwide.

    The resolution pointed out that students in colonial and semi-colonial countries have strengthened their work to strive for national independence, implement national education, and protect national culture. The expansion of contacts and cooperation between students from various countries is an important matter, which has opened up new prospects for international student solidarity.

    The majority of the resolution addressed the issues that the ISU needs to resolve. The resolution stated: The Council believes that fully implementing the ISU's plans and its general policy towards students will make it possible to comprehensively satisfy the needs and interests of students.
