    Shandong People Enthusiastically Support the Draft Constitution
    13.3 Million Participate in Discussions
   [Our Newspaper] The propaganda and discussion activities for the draft constitution in Shandong Province have penetrated deeply into the vast urban and rural areas of the province. Over 13.36 million people in the province have participated in the discussions. People from all walks of life have unanimously expressed their enthusiastic support for the draft constitution during the discussions, and have also put forward many supplementary and revisionary opinions in a serious and responsible manner, demonstrating a sense of ownership. According to preliminary statistics, the total number of opinions raised in various parts of the province reached 134,332.

    Since the end of June, Shandong Province has trained 23,567 report presenters and 581,630 propaganda workers. In two months, the presenters gave 66,830 reports to cadres and the masses of the people (statistics are missing for one special district). According to the statistics from Liaocheng Special District alone, more than 2,245,000 people heard the reports and participated in the discussions, accounting for 91 percent of the total number of adults in the entire special district.

    During the propaganda and discussion, the broad masses of the people regarded the constitution as the law for the emancipation of the people, the law for the unity of all ethnic groups, and the law to ensure the construction of socialism and happiness. At the Provincial People's Congress and the People's Congresses of various counties and cities, the people's representatives enthusiastically discussed the draft constitution and unanimously passed resolutions supporting the draft constitution.

    After studying and discussing the draft constitution, people from all walks of life greatly enhanced their socialist consciousness and labor enthusiasm. After discussing the draft constitution, workers at the Shandong Provincial Silk Weaving Factory actively studied advanced Soviet experiences, resulting in the total output value for July being 104.99 percent of the plan, an increase of 13 percent compared to June. In Houtun Township, Jiaoxian County, after discussing the draft constitution, 320 peasant households applied to join agricultural production cooperatives. Currently, inspired by the draft constitution, farmers across the province are engaged in a production increase campaign to strive for an excess production of 1 billion catties of grain to welcome the birth of the first constitution of the Chinese people.

    The people throughout the province expressed great satisfaction with this nationwide discussion. Some said, "In the past, the Kuomintang reactionaries wanted the people to 'not talk about state affairs,' but now the people are to be masters of their own affairs in major national events, and even the major event of formulating a constitution is to be discussed by the people." Therefore, the masses of the people actively and enthusiastically put forward supplementary and revisionary opinions on the draft constitution during the discussions.

    The supplementary and revisionary opinions put forward by the people of Shandong Province are mostly very specific and are directed at the various chapters and articles of the draft constitution. Some people believe that in the first paragraph of the preamble, "After more than a hundred years of heroic struggle, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, finally won the great victory of the people's revolution against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in 1949, thus ending a long history of oppression and enslavement and establishing the People's Republic of China, a people's democratic dictatorship," the phrase "and Chairman Mao" should be added after "under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party." Regarding the second paragraph of the preamble, "...Our people have victoriously carried out large-scale struggles such as reforming the land system, resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and restoring the national economy in the past few years," some hope to add the Three-Anti Campaign against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and the Five-Anti Campaign against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy work and materials, and theft of state economic intelligence. In the fourth paragraph of the preamble, "In the great struggle to establish the People's Republic of China, our people have formed a broad people's democratic united front of democratic classes, democratic parties, and people's organizations led by the Chinese Communist Party," some suggest adding the words "all ethnic groups." Many people are very concerned about our country's foreign policy in the discussion and suggest changing the phrase "Our country is based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty" in the sixth paragraph of the preamble to "Our country is based on the principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence" to better express the desire of the people of the whole country to maintain world peace.

    In the discussion of the draft constitution, the people of Shandong Province demonstrated a strong desire to build a socialist society, and therefore conducted a very serious and conscientious discussion on the general program part of the draft constitution, and put forward many revisions and supplementary opinions. Some people suggested that a clause should be added to the general program: "Enterprises related to railways, post and telecommunications, shipping, banks, etc., which manipulate the national economic lifeline and the national economy and people's livelihood, shall be operated by the state" so as to make socialist construction more secure. The original text of Article 6, Paragraph 1 of the draft constitution is: "The state-owned economy is a socialist economy of ownership by the whole people, is the leading force in the national economy, and is the material basis for the state to realize socialist transformation. The state guarantees the priority development of the state-owned economy." Some people suggested adding the eight characters "socialist industrialization and" after "the state realizes" to make the realization of socialist industrialization more explicit. The provisions in the general program regarding the state using the development of production cooperation as the main path to transform individual agriculture and individual handicrafts were warmly supported by the broad masses of the people, especially the farmers. At the same time, some people suggested adding the words "animal husbandry, fishery" after "individual handicrafts" in Article 7, Paragraph 2 to give the development of animal husbandry and fishery a clear direction.

    During the discussion, the masses also raised many opinions on the chapter on state institutions. For example, some people suggested changing Article 24, which stipulates that "If there are extraordinary circumstances that prevent elections from being held, the National People's Congress may extend its term until the next National People's Congress is elected," to "If there are extraordinary circumstances that prevent elections from being held, the National People's Congress may extend its term until the next National People's Congress is convened." Some also suggested adding the content "Local people's committees at all levels may establish agencies (such as commissioner's offices, district offices, etc.) according to work needs" in Article 54.

    The basic rights and obligations of citizens stipulated in the draft constitution aroused many sad memories among the people during the discussion, and they felt infinite joy at the various rights they have now obtained, believing that only in a democratic country under the leadership of the Communist Party can the people enjoy these rights. The people also made a detailed study of this chapter and put forward revisions and supplementary opinions. For example, some people believe that Article 94 should add the content of "education and training of children," and Article 97 should also clearly stipulate that "the law guarantees that complainants will not be subject to any retaliation or persecution" to make personal freedom more secure.

    In addition, some people also put forward many supplementary opinions that do not belong to the revision of specific articles, but to the content of the draft constitution. For example, some people proposed that the draft constitution should stipulate articles on the commendation of revolutionary martyrs and the provision of pensions to the families of revolutionary martyrs. Some people proposed that the article "All foreign nationals must abide by the laws of the People's Republic of China" should be added, and so on.

    The Shandong Provincial Draft Constitution Discussion Committee has compiled and reported all these supplementary and revisionary opinions put forward by people from all walks of life to the Drafting Committee of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China.

    山东人民热烈拥护宪法草案
    一千三百三十万人参加讨论
   【本报讯】山东省宪法草案的宣传和讨论活动深入全省广大城乡，全省有一千三百三十六万余人参加了讨论，各阶层人民在讨论中对宪法草案一致表示热烈拥护，同时以主人翁的态度认真负责地提出了许多补充和修改意见。据初步统计，全省各地所提出的意见，其总数共达十三万四千三百三十二条。
    山东省各地从六月底起就先后训练了两万三千五百六十七名报告员，五十八万一千六百三十多名宣传员。两个月中，报告员分别向干部和人民群众作了六万六千八百三十多次报告（缺一个专区的统计数字）。仅据聊城专区的统计，就有二百二十四万五千多人听到了报告并参加了讨论；参加讨论的占全专区成年人总数的百分之九十一。
    在宣传讨论中，广大人民把宪法看作是人民的翻身法、各族人民的团结法、保证建设社会主义的幸福法。在省人民代表大会会议和各县、市人民代表大会会议上，人民代表们都热烈地讨论了宪法草案，并一致通过了拥护宪法草案的决议。
    各阶层人民经过宪法草案的学习和讨论，大大提高了社会主义觉悟和劳动积极性。山东省人民制丝厂职工讨论了宪法草案后，积极学习苏联先进经验，使今年七月份的生产总值完成了百分之一百零四点九九，较六月份提高了百分之十三。胶县十区后屯乡农民，讨论宪法草案后，有三百二十户农民申请参加农业生产合作社。目前，全省农民正在宪法草案的鼓舞下，投入了争取超额增产十亿斤粮食的增产运动，以迎接中国人民第一部宪法的诞生。
    全省人民对于这次全民讨论表示非常满意。有的说：“过去，国民党反动派要人民‘莫谈国事’，现在国家大事都要人民当家作主，制定宪法这件大事也要人民来讨论。”因此，人民群众在讨论中都积极热情地对宪法草案提出了补充修改意见。
    山东省人民所提出的补充和修改意见，绝大部分都很具体，都是针对着宪法草案的各章节各条款提出来的。有人认为，序言第一段“中国人民经过一百多年的英勇奋斗，终于在中国共产党领导下，在一九四九年取得了反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的人民革命的伟大胜利，因而结束了长时期被压迫、被奴役的历史，建立了人民民主专政的中华人民共和国。”一句中，应在“终于在中国共产党”之下加“和毛主席”四字。对序言第二段“……我国人民在过去几年内已经胜利地进行了改革土地制度、抗美援朝、镇压反革命分子、恢复国民经济等大规模的斗争”，有人希望补充上反对贪污、反对浪费和反对官僚主义的三反斗争和反对行贿、反对偷税漏税、反对盗骗国家资财、反对偷工减料和反对盗窃国家经济情报的五反斗争。序言第四段“我国人民在建立中华人民共和国的伟大斗争中已经结成以中国共产党为领导的各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体的广泛的人民民主统一战线。”一句，有人建议加上“各民族”的字样。许多人在讨论中都很关心我国的外交关系的政策，并建议把宪法草案序言第六段“我国根据平等、互利、互相尊重领土主权的原则”字样，改为“我国根据互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的原则”，以更好地表达全国人民维护世界和平的愿望。
    山东省人民在讨论宪法草案中，表现了建设社会主义社会的强烈愿望，因而对于宪法草案总纲部分，作了十分严肃认真的讨论，并提出不少的修改和补充意见。有人建议在总纲中应增加一条：“有关操纵国家经济命脉和国计民生的铁路、邮电、航运、银行等企业，由国家经营。”以使社会主义建设更有保障。宪法草案第六条第一款原文是“国营经济是全民所有制的社会主义经济，是国民经济中的领导力量和国家实现社会主义改造的物质基础。国家保证优先发展国营经济。”有人建议在“国家实现”之下加上“社会主义工业化及”八个字，把实现社会主义工业化更加明确起来。总纲中关于国家以发展生产合作为改造个体农业和个体手工业的主要道路的规定，受到广大人民特别是农民的热烈拥护，同时有人建议在第七条第二款“个体手工业”之下，加上“畜牧业、渔业”数字，使畜牧业、渔业的发展具有明确的方向。
    在讨论中，群众对于国家机构一章也提出了不少意见。如有人建议把第二十四条规定的“如果遇到不能进行选举的非常情况，全国人民代表大会可以延长任期到下届全国人民代表大会选出为止”，改为“如果遇到不能进行选举的非常情况，全国人民代表大会可以延长任期到下届全国人民代表大会召开为止”。也有人建议在第五十四条中，增加“地方各级人民委员会根据工作需要，可设立各级派出机关（如专员公署、区公署等）”的内容。
    宪法草案中规定的公民的基本权利和义务，人民群众在讨论中引起许多悲愤的回忆，并对现在获得的各种权利感到无限的喜悦，认为只有在共产党领导之下的民主国家，人民才能享有这些权利。人民同时也对这一章作了细致的研究，并提出了修改和补充意见。如有人认为第九十四条应加上“对儿童的教育和培养”的内容，第九十七条也应明确规定“法律保障控诉人不受任何报复和迫害”，以使人身自由更有保证。
    此外，有些人在讨论中也提出不少不属于对具体条文的修改，而是对宪法草案内容的补充意见。如有人提出宪法草案中应该规定对革命烈士的褒奖和对革命烈士家属的抚恤的条文，有人提出应增加“一切外国侨民都必须遵守中华人民共和国法律”的条文，等等。
    各阶层人民所提出的这些补充和修改意见，山东省宪法草案讨论委员会都已整理汇报到中华人民共和国宪法起草委员会。
