    The National Print Exhibition, sponsored by the Chinese Artists Association, opened today (the 5th) at the Heavenly King Hall in Beihai Park. A preview was held yesterday morning.

    A total of 210 works are on display, including woodcuts, copperplate engravings, lithographs, and a few glass plate prints from 86 artists in 19 provinces and cities; woodcuts are the most numerous. These works show the development of Chinese prints over the past three years. Chinese prints have a revolutionary tradition. Many of the works on display take their subject matter from the nation's industrial construction, the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement, and the heroic deeds worthy of praise and tears in the War of Liberation and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. Many works depict the new living conditions of fraternal ethnic groups, as well as the beautiful landscapes and flowers and plants of the motherland. There have also been various changes in terms of expression, such as the appearance of lithographs, copperplate engravings, etc., which have not been exhibited in the past, and many colored woodcuts.

    In addition to well-known printmakers such as Gu Yuan, Li Hua, and Yan Han, many young printmakers such as Zhao Zongzao, Li Huanmin, Zhang Jianwen, Jiang Ping, Wu Ran, and Song Guangxun have emerged among the authors of the exhibited works. Some old printmakers who have not created for many years have also participated with new works; these are all gratifying phenomena.

    The exhibition is scheduled to close on the 22nd of this month.

    全国版画展览会今日在北京开幕
    中国美术家协会主办的全国版画展览会，今日（五日）在北海公园天王殿开幕，昨天上午举行了预展。
    此次展出作品共二百一十件，包括十九个省市的八十六位作者的木刻、铜版画、石版画和少数玻璃版画；其中以木刻为最多。在这些作品中可以看到中国版画在最近三年来的发展情况。中国版画是具有革命传统的，在这次展出作品中，许多题材取自国家的工业建设，农村互助合作运动，解放战争和抗美援朝中可歌可泣的英雄事迹；许多作品描绘了兄弟民族的新的生活状况，以及祖国的锦绣河山和美丽的花卉草木等等。在表现形式方面也有了多种多样的变化，如出现了过去未曾展览过的石版画、铜版画等，并且有很多的套色木刻。
    这次展出作品的作者中除著名的版画家如古元、李桦、彦涵等外，出现了不少的青年版画家如赵宗藻、李唤民、张建文、江平、吴燃、宋广训等，还有个别多年没有创作的老版画家，这次也参加了新作品；这些都是可喜的现象。
    这次展览会，预定于本月二十二日闭幕。
