The Bulgarian People's Army Song and Dance Ensemble, from the homeland of Dimitrov, under the leadership of its director and artistic director, Dragan Prokopiev, held successful performances in our capital.

The Bulgarian People's Army Song and Dance Ensemble has brought our people exquisite and valuable artistic achievements of the Bulgarian people. Their performances included works by Bulgarian composers and folk songs, as well as Soviet songs, selections from European classical operas, and Chinese folk songs and songs. From their performances, we can clearly see the tremendous efforts made by Bulgarian composers in creating and developing the people's musical cause. "Sing the Communist Party" (originally titled "Party, Lead Us") by Bulgarian Meritorious Artist and Dimitrov Prize winner, composer Arsen Karastoyanov, is a song full of strength and confidence. On the other hand, "Meeting in Hungary" by composer Georgi Spasov is a very moving waltz-time army lyric song, whose melody is closely related to Bulgarian folk songs. Writing such beautiful lyric songs for soldiers shows that the creative path of Bulgarian composers is very broad.

Bulgarian folk songs are very novel to Chinese audiences, and their characteristic rhythms and tones enrich the treasury of world music culture. The four folk songs sung by the Bulgarian People's Army Song and Dance Ensemble have all been re-created by composers, including "Golden Apple Tree!" by composer Arsen Karastoyanov, "The Shepherd Boy is Asleep," "Reckless Young Man," and "Ah, Daina, Your Flower Has Fallen!" by composer Philip Koutev. Although the themes all reflect the love life of the people, the styles and emotions are very diverse and rich; through them, the optimism of the Bulgarian people, their love of beauty and happy life, and the wisdom of the people expressed through humor and wit are shown. For example, the innocence and liveliness of "Golden Apple Tree!"; the quietness and sweetness of "The Shepherd Boy is Asleep"; the humor and wit of "Reckless Young Man"; and the deep affection of "Ah, Daina, Your Flower Has Fallen!" These songs are deeply loved by us.

Bulgarian folk songs often use very unique time signatures and rhythmic forms, which are combined with the characteristic rhythms of Bulgarian folk dances. This also shows that the Bulgarian people are a nation that sings and dances, and when they sing folk songs, they naturally dance with the rhythm. The folk songs we heard this time are composed of the following special beats:

In the works of Bulgarian composers, we also often find that they skillfully and successfully use the unique tones and rhythms of their own national music; in this way, they develop the traditional elements in national music and endow these elements with new emotional content, thus more vividly expressing the new spiritual outlook of the Bulgarian people. Bulgarian composers have achieved remarkable success in developing and creating new people's music on the basis of their own national music traditions, and their experience is worth our good learning and research.

In their dance music, we saw and heard the performance of the Bulgarian folk band, which is composed of three unique national musical instruments: one is a vertical flute, similar to our Xiao, but with a bright tone. Although the structure is relatively simple, the playing skills are not easy. It is said that it can play tunes from one to four sharp signs and from one to four flat signs; the second folk instrument is the bagpipe, which is made of a complete sheepskin bag, with three pipes attached. A short pipe is used to blow air, a pipe with holes is used to play tunes, and the other long one is a fixed bass. It has a tone similar to an oboe and can play continuous tunes by means of the air bag; the third folk instrument is a four-stringed fiddle. These folk instruments are being valued by Bulgarian musicians and are widely used and improved. At the same time, the characteristics of folk bands in playing styles and tune decorations are also absorbed in the orchestra, making the orchestra's performance more rich and colorful with national characteristics.

What makes us even more excited is that the Bulgarian People's Army Song and Dance Ensemble sang four Chinese songs in the Chinese language: "The East is Red," "People of the World are of One Heart," "Lan Huahua," and "Kangding Love Song," and these songs have been arranged by Bulgarian composers Peter Stuber and Evgeni Komarov. In particular, "Lan Huahua" and "Kangding Love Song" both express overflowing emotions in the arrangement and singing, and the musical images are vividly portrayed. This fully expresses the high enthusiasm and deep friendship of the Bulgarian people and artists for the Chinese people and Chinese people's art.

We thank the Bulgarian People's Army Song and Dance Ensemble for their beautiful performances, which further deepen the Chinese people's understanding and love for the Bulgarian people. We are extremely excited and delighted for the development of the brotherly friendship between the Bulgarian and Chinese people and for the prosperity and flourishing of Bulgarian people's culture and art.

    保加利亚音乐艺术的优美成果
    中国音乐家协会常务理事　李焕之
    来自季米特洛夫祖国的保加利亚人民军歌舞团，在团长兼艺术指导德拉冈·普罗科彼耶夫的领导下，在我国的首都举行了成功的访问演出。
    保加利亚人民军歌舞团给我国人民带来了精美而珍贵的保加利亚人民的艺术成果。在他们演出的节目中包括了保加利亚作曲家的作品及民歌，也包括了苏联歌曲、欧洲古典歌剧选曲及中国的民歌和歌曲。从他们的表演中，我们很清楚地看到：保加利亚作曲家在创造和发展人民的音乐事业上所作的努力是巨大的。保加利亚功勋艺术家、季米特洛夫奖金获得者——作曲家阿森·卡拉斯托扬诺夫所作的“歌唱共产党”（原名“党啊，领导我们”）是一首充满着力量和信心的歌曲；而作曲家格奥尔基·司巴索夫所作的“相逢在匈牙利”却是一首十分动人的三拍子的部队抒情歌曲，它的旋律是和保加利亚民间歌曲有着密切联系的：为战士写出这样优美的抒情歌曲，正说明了保加利亚作曲家的创作道路是十分宽广的。
    保加利亚的民间歌曲对于中国的听众是十分新颖的，它所具有的特性的节奏和音调，丰富了世界音乐文化的宝库。保加利亚人民军歌舞团演唱的四首民歌，都是经过作曲家再创造的，其中有作曲家阿森·卡拉斯托扬诺夫所作的“金色的苹果树啊！”、“牧童睡着了”、“鲁莽的小伙子”，和作曲家菲利普·古特夫所作的“啊，黛娜，你的花掉了！”。虽然主题内容都是反映人民的爱情生活，但风格和感情却是十分多样十分丰富的；通过它们表现了保加利亚人民的乐观情绪、热爱美的和幸福的生活、以及透过幽默和诙谐表现了人民的智慧。比如“金色的苹果树啊！”的天真活泼；“牧童睡着了”的幽静和甜蜜；“鲁莽的小伙子”的幽默和风趣；“啊，黛娜，你的花掉了！”的深情厚意，这些歌曲都深深地为我们所喜爱。
    保加利亚的民间歌曲常常用着很独特的节拍和节奏形式，这是和保加利亚民间舞蹈的特性节奏相结合的。由此也可见保加利亚人民是一个载歌载舞的民族，他们在演唱民歌时，常常自然而然地随着节奏而起舞。这次我们所听到的几首民歌是由下面几种特殊节拍构成的：
    在保加利亚作曲家的作品中，我们也常常发现他们熟练而成功地运用着自己民族音乐中这种特有的音调和节奏；这样，他们发展了民族音乐中的传统因素，并赋予了这些因素以新的情感内容，从而更鲜明地表现了保加利亚人民的新的精神面貌。保加利亚作曲家在自己民族音乐的传统基础上，发展并创造新的人民音乐所获得的成就是很显著的，他们的经验值得我们很好地借鉴研究。
    在他们的舞蹈音乐中，我们看到和听到了保加利亚的民间乐队的演奏，它们是由三种特有的民族乐器所组成的：一种是竖笛，和我国的箫相似，但音色明亮。虽然构造比较简单，但演奏的技巧却很不容易，据说可以演奏从一个到四个升种记号及从一个到四个降种记号的调子；第二种民间乐器是风笛，它是用完整的羊皮做成的风袋，上装三根管子，一根短的用来吹气，一根有孔的用奏曲调，另一根长的是固定低音，它有着近似双簧管的音色，可以借风袋奏出连续不断的曲调；第三种民间乐器是四弦拉琴。这些民间乐器正在为保加利亚音乐家所重视并普遍地应用和改进。同时，在管弦乐队中也吸收民间乐队在演奏风格及曲调装饰上的特点，使得管弦乐的演奏获得更丰富、更多采的民族特征。
    使我们更感到兴奋的是保加利亚人民军歌舞团用中国语言演唱了四首中国歌曲：“东方红”、“全世界人民心一条”、“蓝花花”和“康定情歌”，而且这些歌曲都经过了保加利亚作曲家彼德尔·司都贝尔和埃夫盖尼·柯马洛夫所编配。其中特别是“蓝花花”和“康定情歌”无论在编配和演唱上都表现得感情洋溢，音乐形象获得了生动的刻划。这充分地表现着保加利亚人民和艺术家对中国人民和中国人民艺术的高度的热情和深切的友谊。
    我们感谢保加利亚人民军歌舞团的优美的演出，通过它更进一步加深中国人民对保加利亚人民的了解和热爱，我们为保、中人民兄弟般的友谊的发展、为保加利亚人民文化艺术的繁荣兴旺而感到无比的兴奋和喜悦。（附图片）
