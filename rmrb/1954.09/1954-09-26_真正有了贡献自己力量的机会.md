Since the opening of the Zhonghua Shipyard in 1926, for more than twenty years before the liberation of mainland China, under the dark rule of the three great enemies of old China, my enterprise, like other national industrial and commercial businesses, suffered endless oppression and devastation. In 1932, when the factory was just beginning to take shape, the Shanghai "Public Concession Works Bureau" forced me to move the factory. Later, after various efforts, I rented a piece of land along the river from the "Wharf Authority," only nineteen acres in size, and surrounded by roads on three sides and the river on one side, making expansion impossible. Then, the Japanese imperialist invasion caused severe damage to the factory. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, I was full of hope that it could be revitalized from then on, but unexpectedly, American imperialism brought in a large number of landing crafts, leaving our shipbuilding industry on the verge of collapse. It was extremely difficult to maintain the enterprise, let alone develop it. It was not until after liberation that my factory's shipbuilding business gradually recovered.

In May 1952, after the Zhonghua Shipyard was officially transformed into a joint state-private enterprise, thanks to the direct leadership of the state representatives and the active efforts of the working class, the factory's situation completely changed. In the past two years, the number of workers has increased sixfold, and the factory site, buildings, and dormitories have expanded twofold. The planned total output value for this year will be six times higher than the output value in 1952 before the joint venture. In terms of business management, various new systems and organizations have been established, reversing the past chaos and lack of accountability. Due to the changes in production relations, the workers have further unleashed their enthusiasm and creativity, greatly increasing labor productivity. For example, the labor productivity in October 1953 increased by 44 percent compared to January of the same year. At the same time, due to improved production management and equipment after the joint venture, shipbuilding capacity has rapidly increased. For example, the tonnage of ships built in 1953 was 6.7 times that of 1952. In the past, we could only build small wheel tugboats for the Sichuan River, but now we can build large freighters. The "Dazhong" freighter, recently launched in Shanghai, has a displacement of 2,760 tons, equivalent to 1.9 times the total tonnage of various ships built in 1952. This is the largest freighter built since the establishment of the factory. This development shows that the progress made in the two years after the joint state-private venture has far exceeded the development of the previous nearly thirty years, proving the incomparable superiority of the advanced form of state capitalism, the joint state-private venture, over private enterprises.

I am a technician. In the past few decades, I originally wanted to save the country through industry, but under the long-term influence of capitalist ideology, I became degenerate, pursuing profits and personal development to serve the exploiting class. After the liberation of mainland China, technology truly had the possibility of serving the country and the people. However, due to the obstacle of a purely technical viewpoint, technology could not fully play its role. After the joint state-private venture of the Zhonghua Shipyard, I was appointed as the factory director. Under the leadership and help of the state representatives, I gradually criticized the capitalist technical viewpoint, began to learn from the advanced Soviet experience, and initially understood the principle of combining technology with politics and technology with labor, clarifying the direction of serving production and the people. At the same time, after the joint venture, as production was incorporated into the national plan, the shipbuilding tasks accepted by the factory became more arduous and complex, requiring a high level of technical expertise. Therefore, in my work, on the one hand, it became possible for me to get rid of trivial business and financial work and concentrate on studying technical issues; on the other hand, I also got the opportunity to learn from the advanced Soviet experience and constantly improve and enrich my technical knowledge. As a technician, being able to have the opportunity to contribute all my technology to the country and the people is truly the most pleasant thing. I deeply realize that it was only after the joint venture that I truly had the opportunity to contribute my strength, with authority and power, and to work happily.

The foundation of China's shipbuilding industry is weak, and the level of shipbuilding technology is still low. This is the result of the long-term destruction and suffocation by imperialism and reactionaries. After the liberation of mainland China, under the leadership and support of the People's Government, the shipbuilding industry has made great progress, undertaking a certain responsibility in the construction of the motherland. And now, our responsibility is even greater. The motherland has issued the sacred declaration of liberating Taiwan. Liberating Taiwan is to protect the security of the motherland and the integrity of its territorial sovereignty, and to safeguard peace in Asia and the world. I wholeheartedly support the government's call to liberate Taiwan. I must work with my colleagues in the shipbuilding industry to do a hundred times better in shipbuilding, actively support the great struggle to liberate Taiwan, and actively improve technology, train talents, and contribute our due share to the vast maritime transport industry of the motherland after the liberation of Taiwan.

    真正有了贡献自己力量的机会
    全国人民代表大会代表 公私合营上海中华造船厂厂长  杨俊生
    自一九二六年开办中华造船厂以来，在全国大陆解放以前的二十多年中，在旧中国三大敌人的黑暗统治下，我所经营的企业同其他民族工商业一样，遭受到无穷的压迫和摧残。一九三二年，工厂刚初具规模，上海“公共租界工部局”就逼我搬厂，后来多方设法才向“浚浦局”租到一块沿江地基，只有十九亩大，而且是三面马路一面临江，要想扩展是毫无余地的。接着，日本帝国主义侵入，使工厂遭到惨重的破坏。抗日战争胜利后，我满以为从此可以振兴起来了，不料美帝国主义运来大批登陆艇，把我们造船工业弄得奄奄一息，企业要维持都极为困难，更谈不上发展。直到解放以后，我厂造船业务才逐渐恢复起来。
    一九五二年五月份，中华造船厂正式改为公私合营以后，由于公方代表的直接领导，和工人阶级的积极努力，工厂情况就完全改观了。两年来，工人人数增加了六倍，厂基厂房和宿舍建筑扩大了二倍，今年计划中的生产总值比合营前的一九五二年生产总值将提高六倍。在经营管理方面，已建立了各种新的制度和组织，扭转了过去混乱和无人负责的现象；工人们由于生产关系的变化，进一步发挥了积极性创造性，劳动生产率大大提高，如一九五三年十月份的劳动生产率比同年一月份提高了百分之四十四。同时合营后由于生产管理和生产设备改善，造船能力迅速提高，如一九五三年所造船舶的吨位为一九五二年的六点七倍；过去只能制造行驶川江的小型轮驳，现在能够制造大型货轮了，像最近在上海下水的“大众”号货轮，排水量为二千七百六十吨，相当于一九五二年所建造各种船舶总吨数的一点九倍，这是建厂以来制造的最大一艘货轮。这种发展情况，显示出公私合营后两年来的进步，已远远超过以往近三十年的发展，证明了国家资本主义高级形式的公私合营较之私营企业具有不可比拟的优越性。
    我是一个技术人员，过去几十年来，原想以工业救国，但在资本主义思想长期影响下，变了质，为追求利润、追求个人发展为剥削阶级服务。全国大陆解放以后，技术才有了真正为国家服务为人民服务的可能。但由于单纯技术观点的障碍，因此技术不能充分发挥作用。在中华造船厂公私合营以后，我被派担任厂长，在公方代表的领导和帮助下，逐渐批判资本主义技术观点，开始学习苏联先进经验，初步懂得技术与政治、技术与劳动结合的道理，明确了为生产为人民服务的方向。同时在合营以后，由于生产纳入国家计划轨道，工厂所接受的造船任务就繁重和复杂起来了，需要高度的技术水平。因此我在工作上，一方面有可能摆脱琐碎的业务和财务工作，专心致志地钻研技术问题；另一方面，我也得到机会学习苏联先进经验，不断提高和充实自己的技术知识。作为一个技术人员来讲，能够有机会把自己技术全部贡献给国家和人民，才是一件真正最为愉快的事情。我深深体会到只有合营以后才使我真正的得到了贡献自己力量的机会，有职有权，工作愉快。
    我国造船工业的基础是薄弱的，造船技术的水平还是很低的，这是帝国主义和反动派统治长期摧残窒息的结果。全国大陆解放以后，在人民政府的领导和扶植下，造船工业已有了很大的进展。在祖国建设中担负起一定的责任。而现在，我们的责任更加重了，祖国已发出解放台湾的神圣宣言，解放台湾是为了保护祖国的安全和领土主权的完整，是为了保障亚洲和全世界的和平。我衷心拥护政府解放台湾的号召，我一定要与造船工业同业一起百倍努力地搞好造船工作，积极支援解放台湾的伟大斗争，并且要积极提高技术，培养人才，为台湾解放后祖国辽阔的海运事业尽其应有的贡献。
