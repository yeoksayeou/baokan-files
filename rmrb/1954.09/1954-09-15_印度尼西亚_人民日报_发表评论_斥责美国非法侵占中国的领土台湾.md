Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, September 14th: The Indonesian "People's Daily" published a commentary on the 13th, condemning the United States for illegally occupying China's territory of Taiwan.

The commentary stated that the Taiwan issue is an internal affair of China, just as the West Irian issue is an internal affair of Indonesia. The United States has no right to interfere. The United States' aggressive attitude toward Taiwan will only isolate the United States further.

The commentary stated that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang has become a terrorist group, under the command of US imperialism, disrupting the peaceful lives of the Asian people. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, with the help of Thailand, invades Burma, loots ships passing through the Taiwan Strait like pirates, and conducts sabotage and espionage activities through Kuomintang elements in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia.

The commentary stated that the People's Republic of China is the target of American aggression in Asia. The US occupation of Taiwan poses a direct threat to the independence and security of the People's Republic of China.

The commentary stated that the People's Republic of China, with a population of 600 million, has become a major power, and capitalist countries have had to establish economic and political relations with it. To trade with it, the safety of transportation is necessary, but the piracy of Chiang Kai-shek disrupts maritime traffic to China.

The commentary stated that the liberation of Taiwan not only means the integrity of the territory of the People's Republic of China, but also means the resumption of safe and prosperous international trade with the People's Republic of China. The liberation of Taiwan means the easing of tensions in Asia and the world. The liberation of Taiwan is the inviolable right of the People's Republic of China to exercise for its own independence and security, and for the peace and security of Asia. This is why the decision of the Central People's Government to liberate Taiwan has been supported by every peace-loving country.

The commentary stated that America's six billion dollars and all American weapons failed to save Chiang Kai-shek from being driven out of mainland China. The current $300 million in annual aid and the US Seventh Fleet, plus an employed army of 600,000 old, weak, and disabled soldiers and the entire State Department, will absolutely not save Chiang Kai-shek from being driven out of Taiwan.

### 印度尼西亚“人民日报”发表评论  斥责美国非法侵占中国的领土台湾

    印度尼西亚“人民日报”发表评论
    斥责美国非法侵占中国的领土台湾
   【新华社雅加达十四日电】印度尼西亚“人民日报”十三日发表评论斥责美国非法侵占中国的领土台湾。
    评论说，台湾问题是中国内部的问题，正像西伊里安问题是印度尼西亚的内部问题一样，美国没有权利进行干涉。美国对台湾的侵略态度只会使美国更加孤立。
    评论说，蒋介石匪帮已成为在美帝国主义指挥下破坏亚洲人民的和平生活的恐怖集团。蒋介石匪帮通过泰国的帮助侵入缅甸，像海盗一样劫夺经过台湾海峡的船只，并且通过在东南亚、包括在印度尼西亚的国民党分子，进行破坏和间谍活动。
    评论说，中华人民共和国是美国在亚洲的侵略目标。美国侵占台湾，形成了对中华人民共和国的独立和安全的直接威胁。
    评论说，拥有六亿人口的中华人民共和国已经成为一个大国，资本主义国家不得不和它建立经济和政治关系。为了和它进行贸易，交通的安全是必要的，而蒋介石的海盗行为却扰乱了通往中国的海上交通。
    评论说，台湾的解放不仅意味着中华人民共和国的领土的完整，而且意味着和中华人民共和国恢复安全的和繁荣的国际贸易。台湾的解放意味着亚洲和世界紧张局势的缓和。解放台湾是中华人民共和国为了它自己的独立和安全，为了亚洲的和平和安全而行使的不可侵犯的权利。这就是中央人民政府解放台湾的决定得到每一个爱好和平的国家的支持的原因。
    评论说，美国的六十亿美元和全部美国武器并未能挽救蒋介石不被赶出中国大陆。现在的每年三亿美元援助和美国第七舰队，再加上六十万名老弱残兵的雇佣军队和整个国务院，也绝对挽救不了蒋介石，使他不被赶出台湾。
