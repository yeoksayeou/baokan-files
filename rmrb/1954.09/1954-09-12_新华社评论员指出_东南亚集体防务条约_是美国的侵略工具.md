Xinhua News Agency commentator Wu Min commented: The "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" is an instrument of American aggression.

Following the text of the published "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty," there is a so-called "United States Understanding." This "understanding" states that, according to the United States' understanding, the Southeast Asia Treaty "applies only to Communist aggression." Originally, the phrase "Communist aggression" was written in the main text of the American draft treaty, but several countries participating in the Manila Conference believed that this was too blatant a provocation, and the words "Communist" were deleted from the final signed text of the treaty. However, the so-called "Communist aggression" was still written in a special form after the text of the treaty.

Why did Dulles insist on writing the so-called "Communist aggression"? Does Dulles really think there is any "Communist aggression"? Of course not. Dulles himself knows that there is no such thing as "Communist aggression" in the world.

Many facts have already shown what Dulles means by so-called "Communist aggression." Dulles calls the Korean people's struggle against the American aggressors and their lackey Syngman Rhee "Communist aggression," Dulles also calls the Indochinese people's struggle against French colonialists "Communist aggression"; Dulles also calls the Chinese people's desire to liberate their territory of Taiwan "Communist aggression." In short, in Dulles's eyes, the struggles of people of all countries for national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and for peace and democracy, are obstacles to the implementation of the American aggression plan and should be called "Communist aggression" and opposed.

The Asian people, who are fighting for national independence and peace and democracy, see very clearly that there is no "Communist aggression" in Asia, but only American aggression. The Pacific Ocean has already been openly called an inland lake of the United States by American generals. American troops have come to Asia from more than 10,000 kilometers away, forcibly occupied China's territory of Taiwan, widely established military bases in Asian countries' territories, invaded Korea, and interfered in the Indochina War. The United States has wantonly interfered in the internal affairs of Asian countries, threatening their independence and security, and hindering the peaceful coexistence of Asian countries. Taking the Southeast Asia Treaty, which Dulles has tried his best to plan, as an example, regardless of whether the countries in the Southeast Asia region agree or disagree, it includes them all in the so-called "treaty area," and any country in this area can be designated by the contracting parties as the object of action.

Obviously, "Communist aggression" is a guise used by the American aggression group to disguise its enslavement of the people of all countries. The fact that the American aggression group used the so-called "Communist aggression" as an excuse to barbarously invade Guatemala is the most obvious example. Hitler and the Japanese fascists once used the "Comintern threat" to disguise their aggression plans and prepared to launch the Second World War under the banner of "anti-Comintern." Now, the American aggression group is learning from them.

The United States insists on adding such an "understanding" as "Communist aggression" to the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" and obtaining the approval of other contracting countries. This clearly shows that the Southeast Asia Treaty is merely an instrument for the American aggression group to carry out aggression. The United States attempts to drag other countries into the aggressive war launched by the United States at any time under the pretext of so-called "Communist aggression." Associated Press correspondent Hess in Manila said after the treaty was signed, "The United States will be the judge of what is Communist aggression." Obviously, in this case, the danger faced by other countries participating in this treaty is being led by the nose by the United States and providing cannon fodder for the American aggressors in the so-called "mobile strategy."

Moreover, since the United States has stipulated that the task of the Southeast Asia Group is to deal specifically with so-called "Communist aggression," then the United States uses the pretext of preventing so-called "Communist aggression" to infringe upon the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Southeast Asian countries, interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and harm the rights and interests of other countries in Southeast Asia... Although all of this is an obvious act of aggression, everything stipulated in the treaty does not apply to them. All other contracting countries that have been infringed upon cannot cite any "common defense" provisions in the treaty in this case. The American aggression group can do whatever it wants to these countries even more. Associated Press reporter Hess boasted that the Southeast Asia Group treaty will be a "big stick" in the hands of the United States. It is not difficult to see that this big stick will first hit other contracting countries.

Of course, the United States also attempts to use the organization of the Southeast Asia aggression group to oppose the Chinese people and use "only applicable to Communist aggression" to intimidate and threaten the Chinese people. However, the great Chinese people cannot be intimidated. The Chinese people's will to fight for Asian and world peace is unwavering. Using "Communist aggression" to slander the People's China is becoming less and less marketable in Asia. Except for a small group of people who are more American than the Americans and who make anti-communism and anti-people their profession, no true Asian believes that the Chinese people, who have fought for national independence and freedom for more than a hundred years and have achieved victory, will invade and oppress other Asian countries. The joint statements of the Prime Ministers of China and India and China and Burma this summer have fully demonstrated China's foreign policy of wishing to coexist peacefully with all countries. As the Indian "Vigor Daily" editorial on the 7th said: "The five basic principles have been accepted in the agreement between India and China, and it stipulates that each other's territorial integrity should be respected and the independence of each other should be fully respected." The editorial also said: "China is prepared to provide the same guarantees to all Asian countries. Therefore, there is no reason to create the ghost of fearing China and thus say that Asian peace is threatened."

The Asian people are becoming increasingly clear about the intention of American imperialism to create the myth of so-called "Communist aggression." The American aggression group's conspiracy to use the so-called "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" to force the Asian people to act as cannon fodder will inevitably be met with a shameful failure.

### 新华社评论员指出  “东南亚集体防务条约”是美国的侵略工具

    新华社评论员指出
    “东南亚集体防务条约”是美国的侵略工具
    【新华社十日讯】本社评论员吴敏评论：“东南亚集体防务条约”是美国的侵略工具。
    在已公布的“东南亚集体防务条约”的本文后面，有一段所谓“美国的谅解”。这个“谅解”中说，根据美国的理解，东南亚条约“只适用于共产党侵略”。本来，所谓“共产党侵略”的字样，曾写在美国的条约草案的本文中，只是由于参加马尼拉会议的若干国家认为这未免是一种太明目张胆的挑衅，才在最后签订的条约的本文中，删去“共产党”这几个字。但是在条约的本文后面，仍以一种特殊的形式写上了所谓“共产党侵略”。
    杜勒斯坚持写上所谓“共产党侵略”，是为了什么呢？是不是杜勒斯真的认为有什么“共产党侵略”呢？当然不是。杜勒斯自己也晓得，世界上根本没有什么“共产党侵略”。
    已经有许多事实可以说明杜勒斯的所谓“共产党侵略”是什么意思。朝鲜人民反抗美国侵略者及其走狗李承晚的斗争，杜勒斯叫做“共产党侵略”，印度支那人民反抗法国殖民主义者的斗争，杜勒斯也叫做“共产党侵略”；中国人民要解放自己的领土台湾，杜勒斯也叫做“共产党侵略”。总之，在杜勒斯眼中，各国人民为民族独立、为主权和领土完整、为和平与民主而进行的斗争，都是美国推行其侵略计划的障碍，都应该叫做“共产党侵略”，都要加以反对。
    正在为争取民族独立与和平民主而斗争的亚洲人民看得很清楚，在亚洲并没有什么“共产党侵略”，有的只是美国的侵略。太平洋已经被美国将军公开称为美国的内湖。美国的军队从一万多公里之外来到亚洲，强占中国的领土台湾，在亚洲国家的领土上广泛地设立军事基地，侵略朝鲜和干涉印度支那战争。美国横蛮地干涉亚洲国家的内政，威胁它们的独立安全，阻挠亚洲国家间的和平共处。就以杜勒斯竭力策划出来的东南亚条约来说，这个条约不管东南亚区域的国家同意不同意，把它们一概划进所谓“条约区域”，在这个区域内的任何国家，都可以被条约的缔约国协议指定为采取行动的对象。
    很明显，“共产党侵略”是美国侵略集团用来掩饰它自己奴役各国人民的幌子。美国侵略集团以所谓“共产党侵略”为借口，野蛮地侵略危地马拉的事实，就是一个最明显不过的例子。希特勒和日本法西斯曾经用“共产国际威胁”来掩饰他们的侵略计划，打着“反共产国际”的招牌来准备发动第二次世界大战。现在，美国侵略集团正在学他们的样。
    美国坚持在“东南亚集体防务条约”中加上“共产党侵略”这样一项“谅解”，并且取得其他缔约国家的认可，这就清楚地表明了东南亚条约不过是美国侵略集团进行侵略的工具。美国企图随时借口所谓“共产党侵略”把其他国家拖进美国所发动的侵略战争。美联社驻马尼拉记者赫斯在条约签订后说，“美国将是决定什么是共产党侵略的裁判员。”显然，在这种情况下，参加这个条约的其他国家面对着的危险就是被美国牵着鼻子走，并在美国的所谓“机动战略”中，为美国侵略者提供炮灰。
    而且，美国既然把东南亚集团的任务规定为专门对付所谓“共产党侵略”的，那么，美国借口所谓防止“共产党侵略”来侵犯东南亚各国的主权和领土的完整，干涉其他国家的内政，损害其他国家在东南亚的权益……尽管这一切都是显而易见的侵略行为，但条约中所规定的一切对它们都不适用。所有被侵害的其他缔约国，在这种情况下也就不能引用条约中什么“共同防御”等规定了。美国侵略集团对这些国家更可以为所欲为了。美联社记者赫斯吹嘘东南亚集团条约将是美国手里的“一根大棒”。不难看到，这根大棒首先就要打在其他缔约国的身上。
    当然，美国还企图用组织东南亚侵略集团来反对中国人民，用“只适用于共产党侵略”来恫吓和威胁中国人民。但是，伟大的中国人民是吓不倒的。中国人民为亚洲和世界和平而奋斗的意志是坚定不渝的。用“共产党侵略”来诽谤人民中国，现在在亚洲是越来越没有市场了。除了那些比美国人还要美国化的一小撮以反共反人民为职业的人以外，没有一个真正的亚洲人相信，百多年来为民族独立和自由而奋斗并取得了胜利的中国人民会去侵略和压迫其他亚洲国家。今年夏天中国和印度、中国和缅甸两国总理的联合声明，已经充分表明了中国愿望和各国和平共处的外交政策。正如印度“活力报”七日社论中所说的：“在印度和中国的协议中五项基本原则已被接受，并规定彼此的领土完整应得到尊重，对彼此的独立予以完全的尊重。”社论并说：“中国准备对一切亚洲国家提供同样的保证。因此，制造畏惧中国的鬼话，因而说亚洲和平受到威胁是没有理由的。”
    亚洲人民对于美帝国主义制造所谓“共产党侵略”的神话用意何在，认识得越来越清楚了。美国侵略集团想利用所谓“东南亚集体防务条约”来强迫亚洲人民充当炮灰的阴谋，必然要遭到可耻的失败。
