Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, September 1st: Indonesian newspapers believe that the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan is an internal affair of China and oppose US interference.

    The Jakarta "People's Daily" published an editorial on August 31, denouncing the US's slander that China's liberation of Taiwan constitutes a threat to peace in the East. The newspaper said that Taiwan has been part of Chinese territory since long before the United States was established.

    "Indonesia News" published an article on the same day saying that the People's Republic of China has once again expressed its determination to liberate Taiwan, which embodies the Chinese people's desire to end Chiang Kai-shek's rule over China. The newspaper quoted people recently from Taiwan as saying that the people of Taiwan are eager for the Chinese People's Liberation Army to liberate Taiwan. They are determined and united. The five-star red flag that brings equality and prosperity to all Chinese people will surely fly over the mountains of Taiwan.

    "Indonesia News" said that Taiwan is a part of Chinese territory. Indonesia believes that it is not justifiable to call the recovery of Taiwan by the People's Republic of China an "aggression." The Taiwan issue is an internal matter of the People's Republic of China. For the people of Taiwan, the liberation of this island means freedom from Chiang Kai-shek's police rule and freedom from terror and hunger.

    "Abadi" wrote on the same day that Chiang Kai-shek's continued occupation of Taiwan with the support of the United States is a threat to the People's Republic of China. In order to complete the Chinese revolution, the Chinese leaders believe that the recovery of Taiwan is a matter of course. The newspaper also called for a prompt resolution of the issue of the People's Republic of China's entry into the United Nations, believing that the resolution of this issue would help ease international tensions.

    印度尼西亚舆论支持我国人民解放台湾
    【新华社雅加达一日电】印度尼西亚报纸认为中国人民解放台湾是中国内部的事情，反对美国进行干涉。
    雅加达“人民日报”八月三十一日发表社论，指斥美国所说中国要解放台湾构成了对东方和平的威胁的谰言。报纸说，远在美国还未立国之前，台湾就是中国领土的一部分。
    “印度尼西亚新闻”同日发表文章说，中华人民共和国再次表示了解放台湾的决心，这体现着中国人民要结束蒋介石统治中国的历史的愿望。报纸引述最近来自台湾的人的话说，台湾人民渴望中国人民解放军解放台湾。他们是坚决的、团结的。给全体中国人民带来平等和繁荣的五星国旗一定会飘扬在台湾群山之上。
    “印度尼西亚新闻”说，台湾是中国领土的一部分。印度尼西亚认为把中华人民共和国收复台湾说成是“侵略”是不正当的。台湾问题是中华人民共和国内部的事情。对台湾人民来说，这个岛屿的解放意味着免于蒋介石警察统治的自由以及免于恐怖和饥饿的自由。
    “永恒报”同一天写道，蒋介石在美国支持之下继续盘踞台湾是对中华人民共和国的威胁。为了完成中国的革命，中国领袖认为收复台湾是理所当然的事情。报纸并要求迅速解决中华人民共和国进入联合国的问题，认为这一问题的解决，有助于缓和国际紧张局势。
