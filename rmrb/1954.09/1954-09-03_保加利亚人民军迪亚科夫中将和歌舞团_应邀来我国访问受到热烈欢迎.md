The Chinese people often pay attention to how our brotherly ally, the People's Republic of Bulgaria, is building its great cause of socialism under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party and Comrade Chervenkov. The brilliant achievements of the Bulgarian people in economic and cultural life will inspire the Chinese people who are engaged in socialist construction and socialist transformation. Through this visit and performance of the Bulgarian People's Army Song and Dance Troupe in our country, we will see with our own eyes the achievements of the Bulgarian people in culture and art. I am convinced that due to your excellent performances and tireless work, you will make a valuable contribution to promoting the Chinese people's further understanding of the Bulgarian people and developing the friendship between the people of China and Bulgaria.

Xiao Hua, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government, delivered a welcoming speech. He said: Your arrival will be warmly welcomed by the entire Chinese people and all comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Because you have brought the deep friendship of the Bulgarian people to our people, because you come from the hometown of Comrade Dimitrov, Comrade Dimitrov is one of the most respected and closest friends of our people. Your arrival will help the cultural exchanges between China and Bulgaria and the further development of the friendship between the two peoples. We welcome you with the most sincere enthusiasm and wish you a successful performance!

Then, Lieutenant General Diakov of the Bulgarian People's Army delivered a reply. He expressed his heartfelt gratitude for such a warm and fraternal welcome today. He said that the achievements of the great Chinese people in building a new life are also the achievements of the peace forces headed by the great Soviet Union, and the achievements of all peace-loving people in the world. The Bulgarian People's Army Song and Dance Troupe has come to your country with a very glorious and happy mood to introduce a part of the new culture and art to the great Chinese people, and to exchange the experience of our two countries in building a new socialist culture and art. This will help our two countries achieve greater achievements in the construction of a new life.

Their speeches were repeatedly warmly welcomed by the audience.

In April 1947, the government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria awarded the song and dance troupe the second-class "September 9th" Medal. The song and dance troupe has visited and performed in Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic, and has been greatly appreciated by the people of these countries.
