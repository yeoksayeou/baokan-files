(By Our Correspondent) The late autumn crops replanted in various disaster-stricken areas after drainage are growing well. The broad masses of farmers are strengthening field management, weeding and fertilizing, striving for a bumper harvest of late autumn crops.

The more than seven million mu of late autumn crops replanted by Henan Province farmers after draining water are currently growing vigorously. The buckwheat replanted by farmers in Xinyang Prefecture before August 10th is nearly a foot tall, and the beans are also growing well. The seedlings of late autumn crops sown after August 10th are also more than an inch high, with four or five tender leaves sprouting from each plant. Farmers in Shenqiu, Xiangcheng, Wuyang, Luyi, Shangshui, and other counties in Shangqiu and Xuchang Prefectures planted beans and mung beans at the end of July after drainage. They are now a lush green, with some already flowering and forming pods. More than 1.46 million mu of late autumn crops in Huaibin, Pingyu, Dancheng, and Luyi counties have been weeded twice. Farmers in Pingyu, Suiping, and other counties took advantage of the intervals between rains in August to remove weeds from more than one million mu of fields, and some late autumn crops were also top-dressed. Sixty-seven male and female members of the Xinghuo Agricultural Production Cooperative in the tenth district of Queshan County even carried out weeding and seedling protection work by moonlight at night. Farmers in Shangqiu Prefecture have purchased a large amount of cake fertilizer and chemical fertilizer to promote the vigorous growth of autumn seedlings and achieve full grains, investing in production.

In the rice-growing areas of Anhui Province, the regenerated rice cultivated in early rice fields has begun to head. According to the growth of regenerated rice ears in Minzhu Township, Quanjiao County, the good ones bear forty to fifty grains per ear, and the average ones bear more than thirty grains per ear, estimated to yield about 150 jin per mu. Anhui Province plans to cultivate ten million mu of regenerated rice this year. At present, nearly one million mu have been cultivated in Lu'an Prefecture alone. The regenerated rice in all early rice fields is growing very well. Farmers are currently carrying out top-dressing and weeding.

The more than six million mu of late autumn crops replanted and replaced in the waterlogged areas of Jiangsu Province are growing well. Most of the late rice planted in paddy fields is already more than two feet tall and is about to head. Many of the millet and corn that were replanted and replaced earlier in dry land areas have grown as neatly and sturdily as the original varieties. The early-planted soybeans, mung beans, sesame, etc., that were replaced are also more than a foot tall. The newly sown buckwheat, radishes, and yellow sprouts have all emerged and sprouted leaves, with lush green leaves and vigorous growth. If not affected by unexpected disasters, it is generally estimated that Jiangsu Province farmers can harvest at least 500 million jin of grain from the late autumn crops replanted after the early autumn crops were harvested.

Hubei Province plans to cultivate ten million mu of regenerated rice in areas with suitable conditions this year, several times more than last year. This item alone can produce more than 800 million jin of rice. At present, the harvest of mid-season rice is nearing its end in the province, and the areas that have been harvested have basically completed or exceeded the plan for cultivating regenerated rice. Twenty-one counties, including Xiaogan, Xiangyang, and Yichang, originally planned to cultivate regenerated rice on 60% of the rice field area. According to incomplete statistics in late August, these twenty-one counties have harvested more than 900,000 mu of rice and cultivated 681,000 mu of regenerated rice, accounting for 74.8% of the harvested area, exceeding the original plan for cultivating regenerated rice by more than 14%. Currently, farmers in areas where regenerated rice has been cultivated are carrying out field management work such as waterwheels, irrigation, fertilization, and weeding.

Farmers in mountainous and hilly areas of Hunan Province are doing their best to use all farmland that can be replanted to sow autumn grain crops such as sweet potatoes, mud beans, and buckwheat. Farmers in Linxiang County have used highland and dry land to plant more than 90,000 mu of sweet potatoes, more than doubling the planting area compared to last year. They are now vigorously cultivating regenerated rice on paddy fields with sufficient water sources. Of the more than 90,000 mu of mid-season rice harvested in Pingjiang County, more than 56,000 mu were immediately sown with autumn grain crops. Of the more than 300,000 mu of mid-season rice harvested in Changsha County, more than 200,000 mu have been planted with late rice, mud beans, and sweet potatoes.

The 43,000 mu of late autumn crops such as autumn soybeans, autumn peanuts, late sweet potatoes, and buckwheat planted by Longyan, Changting, Zhangping, and Liancheng counties in the mountainous areas of Fujian Province can increase grain production by more than 5 million jin. After Changting County used idle land to plant another season of autumn soybeans, the county's autumn soybean planting area expanded by more than 30% compared to the original planting plan. Farmers in Xinqiao District, Zhangping County, intercropped about 1,700 mu of autumn soybeans in sweet potato fields. The roots and leaves of the soybeans can increase the organic matter fertilizer in the sweet potato fields and harvest more than 44,000 jin of soybeans.

The broad masses of farmers in various parts of Jiangxi Province are strengthening field management of late autumn crops, striving to increase yield per unit area. After completing the expansion of planting late rice and autumn crops on more than seven million mu in non-disaster areas, the Party committees at all levels promptly led farmers to launch a mass upsurge of repairing ponds and dams to store water for drought prevention, top-dressing, and protecting seedlings. Many agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid groups have formulated plans to protect seedlings and increase autumn harvest. Yongxin County has accumulated more than 62 million jin of fertilizer, rushed to repair more than 700 large and small water conservancy projects, and extinguished insect pests on more than 53 million mu of fields. More than 23,000 mu of regenerated rice in Chongren County have been top-dressed with soil fertilizer and fertilizer powder, and the seedlings are growing vigorously and lushly green. At present, the late rice in the province has been weeded twice and has been universally top-dressed. It is expected that late rice and autumn crops will have a bumper harvest this year.

[By Our Correspondent] Most areas of Sichuan Province are universally promoting the method of careful threshing and gleaning during the autumn harvest. According to preliminary estimates from four prefectures, Nanchong, Suining, Fuling, and Daxian, this method will result in an additional harvest of more than 160 million jin of rice. This year, in order to reduce waste from field scattering, Party and government leading organs at all levels dispatched thousands of cadres to go deep into the countryside to assist local rural work cadres, summarize various threshing experiences, and promote them immediately. After the Zizhong County Committee of the Communist Party of China promoted the local experience of reducing rice mildew and rot losses, 60% of the farmers in the county adopted it. In addition to the reform of other threshing technologies, the county can reduce the loss of more than 5 million jin of rice.

Nearly ten million mu of mid-season rice in Jiangxi Province has had a bumper harvest. Except for a few areas where the flood damage has maintained last year's output or slightly reduced output, most areas of the province have had a good harvest. Gannnan Administrative Region and Ji'an and Fuzhou Prefectures, as well as parts of Jiujiang, Shangrao, Nanchang and other prefectures, can generally complete or exceed the original production increase plan. The demonstration breeding farms and mutual aid cooperative organizations in Ruijin, Ganxian, Pingxiang, Gao'an and other counties generally increased mid-season rice production by about 10% to 20% compared to last year. At present, the mid-season rice in the province has basically been harvested.

    河南等七省晚秋作物生长旺盛
    四川江西农民精打细收稻谷增产
    【本报讯】各受灾地区排水抢种的晚秋作物，都生长良好。广大农民正加强田间作业，除草施肥，争取晚秋作物丰收。
    河南省农民排除积水后抢种上的七百多万亩晚秋作物，目前生长旺盛。信阳专区农民八月十日以前抢种的荞麦已高近一尺，豆子生长的也很好，八月十日以后播种的晚秋作物，幼苗也长一寸多高，每棵并生出了四、五个嫩叶。商邱、许昌专区的沈邱、项城、舞阳、鹿邑、商水等县农民，七月底排水种植的豆子、绿豆现在一片青绿，部分已开花结角。淮滨、平舆、郸城、鹿邑等县一百四十六万多亩晚秋作物，已普遍锄过两遍。平舆、遂平等县农民在八月多雨的日子里，利用阴雨间隙时间，拔除了一百多万亩田间的荒草，部分晚秋作物还施了追肥。确山县十区星火农业生产合作社六十七个男女社员，曾趁夜间月光进行拔草保苗工作。商邱专区农民为促使秋苗健旺生长，达到籽实粒饱，添购了大批饼肥和化学肥料，投资于生产。
    安徽省水稻地区在早稻田里培育的再生稻已开始抽穗。按全椒县民主乡再生稻穗的成长状况，好的每穗结四五十粒，一般的每穗有三十多粒，估计每亩能收一百五十斤左右。今年安徽省计划培育再生稻一千万亩。现在仅六安专区已培育了近百万亩。目前所有早稻田中的再生稻都长得很好。农民们正在进行追肥和锄草。
    江苏省受涝地区补种、改种的六百多万亩晚秋作物生长良好。水田地区播种的晚稻大部已两尺多高，即将抽穗。旱田地区补种、改种较早的粟子、玉米等很多已长得和原种的一样整齐茁壮。改种的黄豆、绿豆、芝麻等，早种的也已一尺多高。新近播种的荞麦、萝卜、黄芽菜等都出土吐叶，叶色青葱，长势正猛。江苏省农民在早秋作物收割后抢种的晚秋作物，如不受意外灾害，一般估计可收获粮食至少在五亿斤以上。
    湖北省今年计划在有条件的地区培育再生稻一千万亩，面积比去年多数倍以上，仅这一项就可以产稻谷八亿多斤。目前全省中稻收割已近尾声，收割地区已基本完成或超额完成了培育再生稻的计划。孝感、襄阳、宜昌等二十一个县原计划培育再生稻为稻田面积的百分之六十，据八月下旬不完全统计，这二十一县已割稻九十多万亩，培育了再生稻六十八万一千多亩，占收割面积的百分之七十四点八，超过原培育再生稻计划的百分之十四强。目前，已培育再生稻地区的农民正在进行车水、灌兜、施肥、除草等田间管理工作。
    湖南省山区、丘陵地区农民，都在尽可能利用一切可以复种的农田播种红薯、泥豆、荞麦等秋粮作物。临湘县农民已利用高田、旱地种了九万多亩红薯，播种面积比去年扩大了一倍多，现在还正在水源充足的稻田上大力培育再生稻。平江县已收割的九万多亩中稻，有五万六千多亩随即播种了秋粮作物。长沙县已收割的三十多万亩中稻，种上晚稻、泥豆、红薯的也已有二十多万亩。
    福建省山区龙岩、长汀、漳平和连城四县利用秋闲地种下的秋大豆、秋花生、晚甘薯和荞麦等晚秋作物四万三千多亩，可多增产粮食五百多万斤。长汀县利用种闲地多种了一季秋大豆后，使全县秋大豆种植面积比原订种植计划扩大百分之三十以上。漳平县新桥区农民在甘薯田里毳种秋大豆一千七百亩左右，黄豆的根、叶既可增加甘薯田的有机质肥料，又能多收获大豆四万四千多斤。
    江西省各地广大农民正在加强晚秋作物的田间管理，争取提高单位面积产量。全省非灾区完成扩种补种晚稻与秋季作物七百余万亩后，各级党委及时领导农民掀起了群众性的修塘坝蓄水防旱、追肥、保苗的热潮，许多农业社和互助组纷纷订出了保苗、秋收增产计划。永新县已积肥六千二百多万斤，抢修大小水利工程七百多处，并扑灭了五千三百多万亩田的虫害。崇仁县二万三千余亩再生稻都追施了土肥和肥田粉，秧苗长得油绿茁壮。现全省晚稻已耘完二道，普遍施了追肥。预计今年晚稻和秋季作物将获得丰收。
    【本报讯】四川省大部地区在秋收中普遍推广精打细收的办法。据南充、遂宁、涪陵、达县等四个专区的初步估计：运用这种办法，将多收稻谷一亿六千多万斤。今年，为减少田间抛撒的浪费，各地党、政领导机关派出数以千计的干部深入农村，协助当地农村工作干部，总结各种打谷经验，立即推广。中共资中县委员会推广当地减少稻谷霉烂损失的经验后，全县百分之六十的农民都采用了，加上其他打谷技术的改革，全县可减少五百多万斤稻谷的损失。
    江西省近一千万亩中稻已经丰收。除少数地区因洪水为害仍保持去年产量或稍有减产外，全省大部地区都有很好的收成。赣南行政区和吉安、抚州两专区及九江、上饶、南昌等专区的部分地区一般都能完成或超额完成原订的增产计划。瑞金、赣县、萍乡、高安等县的示范繁殖农场和互助合作组织的中稻一般都比去年增产一成到两成左右。现在全省中稻已基本收割完毕。
