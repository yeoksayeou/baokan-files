Resolutely Liberate Taiwan and Defend Peace in Asia and the World
Li Zhuchen, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce

    After the great call of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, the various democratic parties and people's organizations issued the "Joint Declaration for the Liberation of Taiwan" on August 22, solemnly declaring to the people of the world: "Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan." This is the common will and determination of the 600 million Chinese people. We warmly support this great call and solemn declaration, and pledge to strengthen our work in all aspects with all our strength to fight to the end to complete the glorious historical task of liberating Taiwan.

    Taiwan has been Chinese territory since ancient times. The "Cairo Declaration" and the "Potsdam Proclamation" during World War II clearly stipulated that Taiwan should be returned to China. However, after the Chinese people liberated mainland China, the US imperialists perfidiously and openly tore up the international agreements they personally participated in signing. They not only sheltered the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, allowing them to continue their traitorous activities while entrenched in Taiwan, but also further occupied Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait with armed forces, attempting to use force to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, and conspiring to use Taiwan as a military base as a springboard for invading mainland China. This arrogant behavior of the United States in infringing upon our country's territory and sovereignty, and its shameless conspiracy to invade our country, is absolutely intolerable to the people of our country.

    Following the Korean armistice, the Geneva Conference restored peace to Indochina, and the cause of peace achieved another great victory. The call of the people of the world for peace and the resolution of international disputes through consultation is rising day by day, and it is obviously beyond the power of the US aggressive bloc's "policy of strength" to contain it. The recent rejection by the French National Assembly of the "European Defence Community" treaty is a powerful manifestation of the victory of the people's will for peace in the capitalist world. Under the circumstances of the unprecedented rise and development of peaceful forces, if the US warmongers dare to act arbitrarily, attempting to be enemies of the Chinese people and even the peace-loving people of the world, and obstruct the Chinese people from liberating their own territory of Taiwan, it will inevitably arouse the unanimous opposition of the people of the world (including the American people), and it will inevitably be severely hit by the united strength of the Chinese people and the peace-loving people of the world.

    The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique once seized power for more than 20 years and carried out a bloody rule. These executioners' hands were stained with the blood of the people, and they were also dictatorial, arbitrary, corrupt, and brought indescribable disasters to the Chinese people. This is inseparable from the US conspiracy to turn China into a colony by using Chiang as a puppet. Since being driven out of mainland China in 1949, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has entrenched itself in Taiwan under the protection of US imperialism, continuing to betray the motherland, and under the instigation and support of US imperialism, it has disrupted the motherland's maritime transportation and continuously carried out harassment and destructive warfare against the motherland's coastal areas. At the same time, due to Chiang's implementation of fascist reactionary rule over the people of Taiwan, the people of Taiwan are groaning under tyranny and suffering from extreme misery. The Taiwan compatriots are looking forward to liberation like a severe drought looking forward to rain clouds. In order to ensure the security and territorial integrity of the motherland, to ensure peace in Asia and the world, to enable the motherland's economic construction to proceed smoothly and rapidly in a peaceful and safe environment, and also to save the compatriots in Taiwan and thoroughly complete the Chinese people's cause of liberation, we must resolutely liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

    The industrialists and businessmen in Taiwan, whether they left their homes due to the deceptive propaganda of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, or have always been in Taiwan, have suffered the oppression and devastation of Chiang. Under Chiang's exorbitant taxes and levies and the control and exploitation of US monopoly capital, they have reached the point of being on their last breath. In contrast, we national industrialists and businessmen living in a new democratic society, under the wise and correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and with the strong support of the People's Government, not only have our enterprises gone from being fragmented before liberation to being restored and developed, but we individuals have also gained the political status we deserve in society. At the moment when the people of the motherland are vigorously and resolutely liberating Taiwan, we urgently hope that the industrialists and businessmen who have fled to Taiwan from the mainland or have always been in Taiwan can face up to the prosperity and progress of the motherland since liberation, especially to correctly understand the actual situation of the industrial and commercial circles in the motherland, compare it with their current situation in Taiwan, weigh the advantages and disadvantages, distinguish between right and wrong, distinguish between enemies and friends, and actively strive to rejoin the warm embrace of the motherland; in this way, they will surely be welcomed by the people. Time is precious and fleeting. We hope that the people in industrial and commercial circles who mistakenly followed Chiang to Taiwan can think deeply, make a decisive decision, abandon the darkness and turn to the light.

    Liberating Taiwan and eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is the sacred historical task of the Chinese people. Only by liberating Taiwan can we complete the complete unification of the great motherland, can we obtain the complete victory of the great cause of liberation, and can we further safeguard peace in Asia and the world. Since the "Joint Declaration for the Liberation of Taiwan" was issued, the People's Liberation Army and people from all walks of life across the country have put forward guarantees, vowing to contribute all their strength to the liberation of Taiwan. We, the national industrialists and businessmen, should unite with the military and civilians of the whole country under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, and make the greatest efforts. We, the people in the industrial and commercial circles across the country, must strengthen our learning, earnestly love the country and abide by the law, actively engage in legitimate production and operation, contribute all our strength from our own work positions, do a good job in supporting the various tasks of liberating Taiwan, and jointly strive for the sacred task of thoroughly eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and defending peace in Asia and the world!

    坚决解放台湾，保卫亚洲及世界和平
    中华全国工商业联合会副主任委员  李烛尘
    在中华人民共和国中央人民政府发出解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团的伟大号召后，各民主党派各人民团体在八月二十二日发表了“为解放台湾联合宣言”，向全世界人民严正地宣告：“台湾是中国的领土，中国人民一定要解放台湾。”这是六亿中国人民的共同的意志和决心。我们热烈拥护这个伟大号召和严正宣言，并誓以全力从各方面加强工作，为完成解放台湾的光荣历史任务而奋斗到底。
    台湾自古以来就是中国的领土，第二次世界大战期间的“开罗宣言”和“波茨坦公告”都明确规定台湾应该归还中国。但是，在中国人民解放了中国大陆以后，美帝国主义竟背信弃义，公然撕毁它亲手参加签订的国际协议，不但庇护蒋介石卖国集团窃据台湾继续进行卖国勾当，并进一步以武装力量侵占台湾及台湾海峡，妄图以武力阻止中国人民解放台湾，并阴谋以台湾为军事基地，作为侵略中国大陆的跳板。美国这种侵犯我国领土、主权的狂妄行为，和侵略我国的无耻阴谋，是我国人民所绝对不能容忍的。
    继朝鲜停战之后，日内瓦会议又使印度支那恢复了和平，和平事业又一次得到了伟大的胜利。全世界人民要求和平和以协商方式解决国际争端的呼声正在日益高涨，显然已非美国侵略集团的“实力政策”所能遏止。最近法国国民议会拒绝批准“欧洲防务集团”条约，就是资本主义世界里人民拥护和平的意志获得胜利的有力表现。在和平力量空前高涨和发展的形势之下，美国好战分子如果敢于一意孤行，妄图与中国人民以至于全世界爱好和平的人民为敌，阻挠中国人民解放自己的领土台湾，那就必然会引起全世界人民（包括美国人民在内）的一致反对，那就必然会遭到中国人民以及全世界爱好和平人民团结力量的严重打击。
    蒋介石卖国集团曾窃据政权二十余年，进行了血腥的统治。这些刽子手们双手染满了人民的鲜血，而且专横恣肆、贪污腐败，给中国人民带来了无法形容的灾难。这和美国企图假手蒋贼把中国沦为殖民地的阴谋，也是分不开的。蒋介石卖国集团自从一九四九年被赶出中国大陆以后，更在美帝国主义的庇护下窃据台湾，继续出卖祖国，并在美帝国主义的指使和支持下，破坏祖国的海上交通，对祖国沿海地区不断进行骚扰性和破坏性的战争。同时由于蒋贼对台湾人民施行法西斯反动统治，使台湾人民呻吟于暴政之下，受尽了水深火热的痛苦，台湾同胞祈盼解放，有如大旱之望云霓。为了保障祖国的安全与领土完整，为了保障亚洲及世界和平，为了使祖国经济建设得到和平安全的环境而顺利迅速地进行，同时也为了拯救台湾的同胞，彻底完成中国人民解放事业，我们必须坚决解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团。
    在台湾的工商业者，无论是由于受到蒋介石卖国集团的欺骗宣传而离开了家园，或是一直在台湾当地的，同样受尽蒋贼的压迫和摧残。他们在蒋贼横征暴敛和美国垄断资本控制剥削下，都已到了奄奄一息苟延残喘的地步。与此相对照，我们生活在新民主主义社会里的民族工商业者，解放五年来在中国共产党和毛主席的英明正确领导下，在人民政府的大力扶持下，不仅企业由解放前的支离破碎走向恢复发展，个人在社会上也获得了应有的政治地位。在目前祖国人民大张旗鼓地要坚决解放台湾的时候，我们迫切希望由大陆跑到台湾的工商业者或一直在台湾的工商业者们，能够正视祖国在解放以来的繁荣和进步，特别是能够正确认识祖国工商界的实际情况，与自己现在台湾所处的境遇作一对比，权衡利害，辨明是非，分清敌我，积极争取重新投入祖国温暖的怀抱；这样，一定会受到人民的欢迎。时间宝贵，转瞬即逝，希望误从蒋贼跑到台湾的工商界人士们能够深思熟虑，当机立断，弃暗投明。
    解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，是中国人民神圣的历史任务。只有把台湾解放出来，才能完成伟大祖国的完全统一，才能获得伟大解放事业的完全胜利，才能进一步维护亚洲及世界和平。自从
  “为解放台湾联合宣言”发表以后，人民解放军和全国各阶层人民都纷纷提出保证，誓为解放台湾贡献出自己一切的力量。我们全国工商业者，应该在中国共产党和人民政府领导下，和全国军民团结在一起，尽最大的努力。我们全国工商界人士一定要加强学习、切实做到爱国守法，积极从事正当的生产经营，从自己的工作岗位上贡献出一切的力量，做好支援解放台湾的各种工作，共同为彻底消灭蒋介石卖国集团，保卫亚洲及世界和平的神圣任务而奋斗！
