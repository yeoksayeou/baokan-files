Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 30th: The Hong Kong Tramways Company has unjustifiably dismissed thirty-one tram workers and refuses to negotiate with the workers to reasonably resolve this labor dispute.

On July 1st of this year, the Hong Kong Tramways Company, using the excuse of "excess manpower," announced the dismissal of thirty-one workers, including Chen Yaocai, chairman of the Hong Kong Tram Workers' Union, who had served the company for twenty-nine years; Yang Guang, the union's vice-chairman; and Feng Lan, a union director with twenty-five years of service. For more than fifty days, in order to secure reasonable protection for their livelihoods and to care for social transportation, Hong Kong tram workers have been requesting the management to resolve this labor dispute through negotiations with the workers, and have repeatedly requested the Hong Kong British government's Labour Department to be responsible for mediation. As of the 28th, representatives of the Tram Workers' Union have visited the Labour Department as many as fifteen times. The Hong Kong and Kowloon Trades Union Council also submitted a proposal to the Hong Kong British government's Colonial Secretary on July 8th, requesting them to be responsible for organizing a mediation body to reasonably resolve this labor dispute. However, the Tramways Company management has consistently refused to negotiate with the workers, and the Hong Kong British government and its Labour Department have consistently stated "non-intervention in this matter" and refused to take responsibility for handling it.

The attitude of the Tramways Company management in refusing to negotiate and the statement of the Hong Kong British government's Labour Department that it is not responsible for mediation has aroused dissatisfaction among tram workers and workers in various industries in Hong Kong, and has also aroused close concern from residents in all sectors of Hong Kong. Dozens of union organizations, such as the Hong Kong Electric Company and China Light and Power Company, have held meetings and separately organized "Committees to Support Tram Workers in Protecting Their Livelihoods" to support the reasonable struggle of the tram workers.

Due to the refusal of the Tramways Company management to negotiate and the irresponsibility of the Hong Kong British government's Labour Department to mediate, the dispute has been dragging on for more than fifty days without resolution. On the evening of the 26th, the Hong Kong Tram Workers' Union held an emergency meeting, and all workers present unanimously passed a resolution stating that if the Tramways Company management does not quickly agree to negotiate with the workers to resolve this dispute, the tram workers will be forced to strike for two hours to protest against the Tramways Company management's unreasonable dismissal of people. The meeting also passed a "Letter to People from All Sectors of Society Regarding the Forced Action of a Protest Strike." The letter to the public stated that the decision of the tram workers to prepare for a two-hour strike to protest was a forced action taken under the circumstances of "no way to mediate, no door to negotiate, and unbearable suffering for all our workers." The letter to the public finally "urges the management to change its attitude and urges the Hong Kong British government authorities to quickly take responsibility for mediation in order to strive for a reasonable resolution of the incident."

    香港电车公司无理开除工人并拒绝谈判解决纠纷
    香港电车工人被迫准备停工表示抗议
    【新华社广州三十日电】香港电车公司无理开除三十一名电车工人，并拒绝和工人谈判以合理解决这项劳资纠纷。
    今年七月一日，香港电车公司借口“人力过剩”，竟宣布开除工人三十一名，其中包括在公司服务达二十九年的老工人——香港电车职工会主席陈耀材、工会副主席杨光和服务达二十五年的工会理事冯兰。香港电车工人为了争取职业生活的合理保障和为了照顾社会交通，五十多天来，一直要求资方和工人通过谈判解决这次劳资纠纷，并一再要求香港英国政府劳工处负责调处，截至二十八日止，电车工会代表往访劳工处已达十五次之多。港九工会联合总会也在七月八日向香港英国政府辅政司提出建议，要求负责组织一个调处机构，来合理解决这次劳资纠纷。但是，电车公司资方一直拒绝和工人谈判，香港英国政府和它的劳工处也一直表示“对此事不干预”而不负责处理。
    香港电车公司资方这种拒绝协商的态度和香港英国政府劳工处不负责调处的表示，已引起电车工人和香港各业工人的不满，同时也引起香港各界居民的密切关怀。香港电灯公司、中华电力公司等几十个工会组织纷纷举行集会，并分别组织了“支援电车工友保障职业生活委员会”支持电车工人的合理的斗争。
    由于电车公司资方拒绝协商和香港英国政府劳工处不负责调处，使这次纠纷拖延达五十多天仍未解决，香港电车职工会二十六日晚举行了紧急同人大会，全体到会工人一致通过一个决定，如果电车公司资方不迅速同意和工人谈判来解决这次纠纷，电车工人将被迫停工两小时，以示对电车公司资方无理开除人的抗议。这个会上并通过一项“为迫不得已采取停工抗议行动告各界社会人士书”。告社会人士书表示：电车工友准备停工两小时以示抗议的决定，是在“调处无路，谈判无门，我们全体工友忍无可忍的情况下”被迫采取的。告社会人士书最后“促使资方改变态度，促请香港英国政府当局迅速负责调处，以争取事件的合理解决”。
