Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, September 1st dispatch: On the occasion of celebrating the anniversary of the August Revolution and the ninth anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Chairman Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a letter to the people, army, cadres, and overseas compatriots. The full text is as follows:

Compatriots, Army, Cadres, and Overseas Compatriots:

On the occasion of celebrating the August Revolution and National Day, I, on behalf of the government, extend my heartfelt congratulations to you.

Eighty years ago, the feudal dynasty sold our motherland and people to the French colonialists. In that dark era, from our ancestors to us, we have waged unyielding struggles to win national freedom and independence.

During World War II, the Soviet Union achieved a great victory, eliminating German fascists and Japanese warlords. This great victory made our August Revolution successful.

What was the purpose of the August Revolution? It was to win back peace, unification, independence, and democracy for our motherland and people.

The August Revolution succeeded, and on September 2nd, our country declared independence. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam was born. We conducted free and universal elections, and the people elected the National Assembly, which passed the Constitution and elected the Central Government. Local governments from the village level to the provincial level were elected by the people. Since then, we have begun to realize unification, independence, and democracy.

Our people and government have always yearned for peace in order to carry out national construction and create a free and happy life.

But before long, the bellicose French colonialists re-ignited the war, attempting to subjugate our country again and force our people into slavery.

When the motherland faced danger, our people, army, cadres, and government united closely and resolutely carried out eight or nine years of resistance, achieving many great victories.

The purpose of the war of resistance was to safeguard and develop the achievements of the August Revolution - peace, unification, independence, and democracy.

Thanks to the heroic resistance of our army and people, and thanks to the support of the people of various fraternal countries, the French people, and peace-loving people around the world, we won a victory at the Geneva Conference.

The French government has recognized, and the countries participating in the conference have also confirmed the following principles:

Restoring peace in Indochina on the basis of France respecting the independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos;

The people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos will conduct free and universal elections to unify the country;

France will withdraw its troops from Indochina.

We have signed a ceasefire agreement with France, and peace has begun to be restored in Vietnam and throughout Indochina.

This is a great victory. This victory was achieved by relying on the high patriotic enthusiasm, unity, and self-sacrificing fighting spirit of the entire army and people from North to South Vietnam, in enemy-occupied areas and liberated areas.

This victory is the result of the August Revolution, the September 2nd declaration of independence, and the eight or nine years of heroic resistance.

This is a victory for the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, as well as a victory for the French people and peace-loving people around the world.

The new victory has brought about a new transformation in our country's situation, that is, from war to peace. But in order to win comprehensive and lasting peace, we must strive to fight.

The new situation has presented new tasks to our people, army, cadres, and government. Today, our general task is to correctly implement the ceasefire agreement and strive to maintain and consolidate peace, and to achieve unification, complete independence, and democracy throughout the country.

In order to achieve unification, independence, and democracy throughout the country, we must first maintain and consolidate peace.

In order to maintain and consolidate peace, both Vietnam and France should have sincerity. On this occasion, I once again solemnly declare: We unswervingly respect and implement the ceasefire agreement we signed with France. We will protect the economic and cultural interests of the French living in Vietnam. We are ready to continue negotiations with the French government on the principle of equality and mutual benefit in order to establish various good relations between the two countries.

At the same time, we hope that the French government will also respect and implement the ceasefire agreement, and ensure full implementation of the provisions of the final declaration of the Geneva Conference and the French government's statement.

In order to maintain and consolidate peace, we must unite closely. Unite all compatriots, so that compatriots from North to South Vietnam are closely united like a family.

Unite with the fraternal people of Cambodia and Laos. Unite with the people of Asia. Unite with the French people and peace-loving people around the world, especially the Soviet people and the Chinese people.

We should unite like one person to resist the conspiracies of the destroyers of peace - American imperialism, French warmongers, and their lackeys.

All compatriots from North to South Vietnam must fight to prepare for free and universal elections in order to achieve national unification.

Only when peace is maintained and consolidated, and the country is unified, can independence and democracy be realized throughout the country.

The new tasks present us with the following urgent tasks:

We must consolidate the People's Army, which is the pillar for defending the motherland and maintaining peace;

We must continue to realize the slogan of "land to the tiller" to liberate the peasants, that is, to liberate the vast majority of our compatriots;

In the old liberated areas, we must continue to consolidate work in all aspects, improve the lives of the people, and give full play to the people's traditional heroic spirit. We must strengthen the unity and friendship between all nationalities, and gradually realize national autonomy in areas inhabited by ethnic minorities;

In the newly liberated villages and cities, first of all, we must stabilize social order and the people's lives, protect the lives and property of the people and foreign nationals, including French nationals. Protect freedom of belief. Those former personnel and staff who used to work for the other side and are now willing to serve the country and the people will be employed and given good treatment. We must restore trade, education, and other work;

In the old and new liberated areas, regarding politics, we must consolidate the people's power, develop and consolidate patriotic people's organizations, improve the people's political level and spirit of unity and struggle to defend peace, and realize unification, independence, and democracy throughout the country. Regarding the economy, we must promote the production increase competition movement, implement the policy of "taking into account both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, helping each other between urban and rural areas, and exchanging domestically and internationally" to facilitate the restoration and development of production, make the economy increasingly prosperous, and make the people's lives increasingly prosperous. Regarding culture, we must thoroughly eliminate illiteracy, train cadres to build the country, protect the people's health, and advocate simple customs;

In areas where French troops are temporarily concentrated, our people will launch political struggles to demand democratic rights such as freedom of assembly, association, and speech, in order to prepare for free and universal elections and achieve national unification;

Overseas compatriots must care for and help each other, wholeheartedly support the motherland, and expand the close friendship between our people and the people of all countries;

For those who express patriotism today, no matter which class they belong to, and even if they have cooperated with the other side before, we are prepared to unite with them to jointly maintain and consolidate peace, and realize unification, complete independence, and democracy throughout the country.

We have won a victory, but peace has not been truly consolidated, unification, independence, and democracy have not been completed, so we should make a long-term and arduous struggle to achieve this goal. At the same time, we should constantly be vigilant to prevent any conspiracy that undermines our common cause.

Although the work is arduous and difficult, our strength is strong. Because we are united, because we have determination, because progressive mankind all over the world supports us, there is no doubt that our cause will be successful.

On this occasion, I, on behalf of the government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, would like to express my gratitude to the people and governments of friendly countries, to the various people's organizations in France, to the various peaceful and democratic organizations in the world, and to the progressive people of all countries, who sympathized with us during our war of resistance and celebrated with us in restoring peace. This spirit of internationalism is invaluable. In the days of arduous resistance, it was an encouragement to us. It will help us build a lasting peace.

The growing world peace and democracy movement has helped us achieve victory. Our victory will also contribute to the cause of defending peace in Asia and the world.

All compatriots, army, cadres, and overseas compatriots must forge ahead courageously.

Long live the peace, unification, independence, and democracy of Vietnam!

The world's forces for peace and democracy will surely win!

    越南民主共和国胡志明主席发表
    告全国军民、干部和海外侨民书
    【新华社讯】越南通讯社北越一日电：越南民主共和国胡志明主席为庆祝越南八月革命纪念日和越南民主共和国成立九周年，发表告全国军民、干部和海外侨民书。全文如下：全国同胞、军队、干部和海外侨胞们：
    值此庆祝八月革命和国庆九周年之际，我谨代表政府向你们致亲爱的祝贺。
    八十年前，封建皇朝把我们的祖国和人民出卖给法国殖民者。在那个黑暗的时代里，为了争取民族的自由和独立，从我们的祖先一直到我们，曾经进行了不屈不挠的斗争。
    在第二次世界大战中，苏联取得伟大胜利，消灭了德国法西斯和日本军阀。这个伟大胜利，使我们的八月革命得到成功。
    八月革命的目的是什么？那就是为我们的祖国和人民争回和平、统一、独立和民主。
    八月革命成功，九月二日我们国家宣布独立。越南民主共和国诞生了。我们进行了自由普选，全国人民选举了国民大会，国民大会通过宪法并选出中央政府。自乡级到省级的地方政权都由人民选出。从那时起，我们已开始实现统一、独立和民主。
    我们的人民和政府无论何时都渴望着和平，以便进行国家建设，创造自由、幸福的生活。
    但没有多久，好战的法国殖民者重又挑起战争，企图重新灭亡我国和迫使我国人民做奴隶。
    当祖国面临危难的时候，我们的人民、军队、干部和政府紧密地团结在一起，坚决地进行了八、九年的抗战，取得了许多巨大的胜利。
    抗战的目的就是为了维护和发展八月革命胜利的成果——和平、统一、独立和民主。
    由于我们的军队和人民英勇抗战，由于我们得到各个兄弟国家人民、法国人民和世界爱好和平人民的支持，因此我们在日内瓦会议上赢得了胜利。
    法国政府已经承认而参加会议的各国也已确认了如下的一些原则：
    在法国尊重越南、柬埔寨和老挝三国的独立、主权、统一和领土完整的基础上来恢复印度支那的和平；
    越南、柬埔寨和老挝人民将进行自由普选以统一国家；
    法国将把它的军队自印度支那撤出。
    我们已和法国签订停战协定，和平已开始在越南和整个印度支那恢复了。
    这是一个巨大的胜利。这个胜利是依靠自北越至南越、在敌占区和解放区的全体军民那种高度的爱国热忱、团结一致和自我牺牲的战斗精神而获得的。
    这个胜利是八月革命、九月二日宣布独立和八、九年来进行英勇抗战的结果。
    这是越南、柬埔寨和老挝人民的胜利，也是法国人民和世界爱好和平人民的胜利。
    新的胜利使我国的形势有了新的转变，这就是从战争转到和平。但为了争取全面的和持久的和平，我们应该努力进行斗争。
    新的形势向我们的人民、军队、干部和政府提出了新的任务。今天我们总的任务是：正确履行停战协定，为维护和巩固和平，为在全国实现统一、完成独立和民主而斗争。
    为了在全国实现统一、独立和民主，首先我们必须维护和巩固和平。
    为了维护和巩固和平，越、法双方应该具有诚意。借此机会，我再一次郑重申明：我们信守不渝地尊重和履行我们和法国签订的停战协定。我们将保护居住在越南的法国人的经济和文化利益。我们随时准备在平等互利的原则上和法国政府继续谈判，以便在两国间建立起各种良好关系。
    同时，我们希望法国政府也能尊重和执行停战协定，保证完全执行日内瓦会议最后宣言中的条款和法国政府的声明。
    为了维护和巩固和平，我们应该紧密地团结起来。团结全国同胞，使自北越到南越的同胞紧密地团结得像一个家庭一样。
    和兄弟般的柬埔寨人民和老挝人民团结起来。和亚洲人民团结起来。和法国人民以及世界爱好和平的人民，首先是苏联人民和中国人民团结起来。
    我们应该像一个人一样的团结在一起，以抗击和平的破坏者——美帝国主义、法国好战分子及其走狗们的阴谋。
    自北越至南越的全体同胞们必须为准备自由普选而斗争，以实现全国统一。
    只有和平得到维护和巩固，全国得到统一，独立和民主才能在全国实现。
    新的任务给我们提出如下一些迫切的工作：
    我们必须巩固作为捍卫祖国、维护和平的支柱力量——人民军队；
    我们必须继续实现“耕者有其田”的口号，以解放农民，即解放我们最大多数的同胞；
    在老解放区，我们必须继续巩固各方面的工作，改善人民的生活，发挥人民传统的英勇精神。我们必须加强各民族之间的团结友谊，在少数民族聚居的地区逐渐实现民族自治；
    在新解放的乡村和城市，首先我们必须稳定社会秩序和人民生活，保护人民和包括法国侨民在内的外国侨民的生命、财产。保护信仰自由。对于过去曾经给对方工作的旧人员、职员，现在愿意为国家为人民服务的，将得到任用并予以好的待遇。我们必须恢复贸易和教育等等工作；
    在老解放区和新解放地区，关于政治方面，我们必须巩固人民政权，发展和巩固爱国的人民团体，提高人民的政治水平和团结奋斗、捍卫和平的精神，并在全国实现统一、独立和民主。关于经济方面，我们必须推进增产竞赛运动，实行“公私兼顾、劳资两利、城乡互助、内外交流”的政策，以利恢复和发展生产，使经济愈益繁荣，人民生活愈益富裕。关于文化方面，我们必须彻底扫除文盲，培养干部以建设国家，保护人民的健康，崇尚淳朴风习；
    在法军暂时集结地区，我们人民将展开政治斗争，要求实行集会结社自由、言论自由等等民主权利，以准备自由普选，实现全国统一；
    旅居国外的侨胞们必须互相爱护和互相帮助，全心全意支援祖国，扩展我国人民和各国人民间的亲密友谊；
    对于那些今天表示爱国的人，不管他属于那个阶层以及即使在此之前曾经和对方合作，我们准备和他们团结一起来共同维护和巩固和平，在全国范围内实现统一、完成独立和民主。
    我们已赢得胜利，但和平还没有真正巩固，统
  一、独立和民主还未完成，因此我们应该作持久的和艰苦的奋斗，以争取达到这个目的。与此同时，我们应该不断地提高警惕，预防破坏我们共同事业的任何阴谋。
    工作虽然是繁重和有困难的，但我们的力量是强大的。因为我们团结一致，因为我们有了决心，因为全世界进步人类都支持我们，毫无疑问，我们的事业一定成功。
    值此机会，我谨代表越南民主共和国政府和人民向各友好国家的人民和政府、向法国各人民团体、向世界各个和平民主团体和各国进步人士表示感谢，他们在我们进行抗战的期间同情我们、在恢复和平的时候又和我们同声庆贺。这种国际主义精神是无比宝贵的。在艰苦抗战的日子里，它对我们是一个鼓舞。它将有助于我们建设持久和平的事业。
    日益壮大的世界和平民主运动已帮助我们取得胜利。我们的胜利也将有助于保卫亚洲和世界的和平事业。
    全体同胞、军队、干部和侨胞们要奋勇迈进。
    越南和平、统一、独立和民主万岁！
    世界和平民主力量一定胜利！
