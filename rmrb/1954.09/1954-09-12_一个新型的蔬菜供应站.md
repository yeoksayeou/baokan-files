    A New Type of Vegetable Supply Station
    Ge Tian
    Early in the morning, just as the sun begins to peek over the horizon, the Qinglongqiao Vegetable Station market on the outskirts of Beijing is already bustling with activity. Staff members are busily affixing labels marked with "Name of Organization," "Name of School," "Name of Military Unit," and the corresponding weight in jin and liang to piles of vegetables and baskets of produce on the market grounds. Carts and trucks arrive one after another to transport the vegetables. However, one rarely sees farmers delivering vegetables here. Where do these vegetables come from? It turns out that after agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams have signed purchase and sales contracts with the vegetable station, they transport the vegetables by cart to the station in the evening before, according to the contract stipulations and market demand.

    Qinglongqiao is a small town about forty li from Beijing. A dozen or so townships around here are abundant in vegetable production, and there are many organizations and schools nearby that require thousands or even tens of thousands of jin of vegetables every day. However, in the past, year-round, regardless of wind or rain, the vegetable farmers in this area would transport vegetables by cart to markets in Fuchengmen or Guang'anmen to sell, while purchasing personnel from nearby organizations and schools would diligently go to the city every day to buy vegetables. This phenomenon of "vegetable travel" not only wasted manpower and resources but also reduced the income of vegetable farmers and increased the burden on consumers. But they were not oblivious to this unreasonable situation; they just hadn't come up with a good solution. Therefore, in the past, one often heard people sighing and saying, "Forget it! A mute eating Coptis chinensis, the bitterness stays inside!"

    In the past, there was indeed a vegetable market in Qinglongqiao, but this small market was controlled by a few speculative vegetable merchants. They arbitrarily drove down the prices when buying from vegetable farmers and raised prices when selling to consumers. At the time, as soon as they saw purchasing agents from several organizations and schools arrive at the market, they would immediately raise vegetable prices, and these purchasing agents, sometimes due to urgent needs, had to buy even though they knew they were being taken advantage of. As a result, most of the nearby vegetable farmers and consumers preferred to travel dozens of li to the city rather than trade locally.

    In April of this year, the Haidian District Supply and Marketing Cooperative signed a contract for the integration of vegetable production and sales with agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in the Qinglongqiao area. However, after the contract was signed, problems followed. Where could so many vegetables be sold? If they were transported to the city as before, wouldn't it be a futile back-and-forth, wasting manpower? Finally, they came up with the idea of "local sourcing, local supply" and established the Qinglongqiao Supply and Marketing Cooperative Vegetable Station. Through contractual relationships, they gradually attracted nearby vegetable farmers and consumer units to this market. Now, they have established contractual supply and sales relationships with seven agricultural production cooperatives, more than thirty mutual aid teams, and more than one hundred organizations, schools, and military units. The vegetable supply has increased from one or two thousand jin per day to twenty-seven or eight thousand jin, which can supply tens of thousands of people for one day.

    The establishment of the Qinglongqiao Vegetable Station has brought great benefits to nearby farmers and organizations, schools, military units, and other consumers. A salesperson from an agricultural production cooperative in Mentou Village said, "In the past, when we went to the city to sell vegetables, we had to load the cart one day and couldn't return until the afternoon of the next day, which took two days back and forth, and exhausted both people and horses; now it's much easier, we can make a trip in the time it takes to eat a meal." Therefore, some mutual aid teams and individual vegetable farmers who have not yet signed contracts with the vegetable station are now also requesting to sign contracts. Organizations, schools, and military units find it even more convenient. As long as they submit their vegetable consumption plan to the vegetable station the day before they need vegetables, the vegetable station can organize the supply from agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, or individual vegetable farmers according to the plan. This eliminates the need for them to run around or worry about not being able to buy vegetables. For example, the military unit living nearby used to have to go to Tongxian because they couldn't buy vegetables, keeping three purchasing agents busy all day long. After signing the contract, not only do they not have to worry about not being able to buy vegetables, but one person can do the work that used to require three people.

    Through supply and sales contracts, the vegetable station can not only master the vegetable purchase and sales plan, balance the plan, and guide vegetable farmers to deliver more or less to avoid stockpiling and shortages; at the same time, when a certain vegetable cannot meet the needs of the vegetable-consuming units, the vegetable station can also go to more distant places to purchase according to its possible conditions. For example, some time ago, many units ordered a lot of hyacinth beans, and nearby agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual vegetable farmers did not have so many hyacinth beans to supply. The vegetable station immediately sent people to the Dongran Village No. 1 Agricultural Production Cooperative to transport back a large batch of hyacinth beans, meeting the needs of the vegetable-consuming units.

    The Qinglongqiao Vegetable Station was established and developed in the struggle to seize the market from speculative merchants. When the vegetable station was first established, the variety and quantity of vegetables were small, and speculative merchants took the opportunity to cause trouble, saying strange things, "Just these few kinds of vegetables, they're all gone as soon as you buy them, and they call themselves a cooperative!" Whenever a certain vegetable was in short supply, they used the means of buying at high prices and selling at low prices to create dissatisfaction with the supply and marketing cooperative among vegetable farmers and consumers. But these conspiracies and tricks were finally exposed and dismantled one by one. For example, an old lady, greedy for a small advantage, sold forty jin of leeks to private merchants, but was cheated out of four jin in weight, and when she settled the account, they also rounded down the numbers, which made her scold the merchants fiercely, "From now on, no matter what, I will never be fooled by you merchants again." Now, the sweet talk of the merchants can no longer deceive people. As a purchasing agent from the North China Administrative Committee said, "In the past, we always suffered losses from the merchants. Now that we have a cooperative, we must go there to buy. If they don't have the vegetables we want, we can change to something else."

    (Attached image) The Tianqiao Vegetable Station supplies the people of the capital with about 300,000 jin of vegetables every day. This is the vegetable station selling large quantities of vegetables to canteens and ordinary citizens of governmental organs, organizations, troops and industrial and mining enterprises.

    一个新型的蔬菜供应站
    歌天
    早晨，太阳刚露出曙光，京郊青龙桥菜站市场上就呈现着一片热闹景象。菜站的工作人员，紧张地把写着“某某机关”、“某某学校”、“某某部队”和多少斤两的标签，贴在场上一堆堆的菜垛和一筐筐蔬菜的箩筐上，一辆辆的大车和汽车，陆续地赶来场上把蔬菜运走。在这里却很少看见送菜的农民，究竟这些蔬菜是从那里来的呢？原来是农业生产合作社、互助组和菜站订立了购销合同后，他们就根据合同的规定和市场的需要，在前一天的傍晚把蔬菜用大车运到菜站来。
    青龙桥是距北京四十里左右的一个小镇，这里周围十几个乡都盛产蔬菜，附近有很多机关和学校，他们每天需要几千斤以至几万斤的蔬菜。可是，以前一年四季，无论风里雨里，这一带的菜农都是一车一车地把蔬菜运进阜成门或广安门的市场出卖，而这里附近的机关、学校的采购人员，也不辞劳苦地每天进城买菜。这种“蔬菜旅行”的现象，不仅白白地耗费了人力、物力，而且减少了菜农的收入，增加了消费者的负担。但他们对这种不合理的现象并不是没感觉到的，只是还没想出个好办法来。因此，过去在这里常常听到有人唉声叹气地说：“算了罢！哑吧吃黄连，苦在心里！”
    以前，青龙桥镇上并不是没有菜市的，只是这个小菜市却被几家投机菜商把持着，他们肆意对菜农杀价收买，对消费者抬价出售。当时，他们一看见有几个机关学校的采购员来到市场，马上就抬高菜价，而这些采购员，有时为了急需，明知吃亏也得买下来。就这样，附近的大多数菜农和消费者，宁肯跑几十里到城里来，也不愿在当地进行买卖。
    今年四月间，海淀区供销合作社和青龙桥一带的农业生产合作社、互助组订立了蔬菜产销结合合同，可是合同签订之后，问题也跟着来了，这么多蔬菜弄到哪儿卖呢？如果像以前那样运到城里去，还不是徒劳往返、浪费人力吗？最后，他们终于想出了“就地取材、就地供应”的办法，成立了青龙桥供销合作社菜站。并通过合同关系，逐渐地把附近的菜农和消费单位吸引到这个市场上来。现在，他们已和七个农业生产合作社、三十多个互助组、一百多个机关、学校、部队建立了合同的供销关系，蔬菜的供应量已由每天一两千斤增到两万七八千斤，可以供应数万人一天的食用。
    青龙桥菜站的成立，给附近的农民和机关、学校、部队以及其他的消费者带来了很大好处。门头村一个农业生产合作社的推销员说：“以前进城卖菜，头一天装车去，第二天下午才能回来，来回就得两天，还累得个人困马乏；现在可省事了，吃顿饭的工夫，就能送一趟。”因此，有些还没有和菜站订立合同的互助组和个体菜农，现在也都纷纷要求签订合同。在机关、学校、部队方面，更感到莫大的方便，只要在用菜的前一天把用菜计划提交菜站，菜站就可以根据计划向农业生产合作社、互助组或个体菜农组织货源，这样，就用不到自己东奔西跑，或耽心买不到菜。如附近住的部队，过去因买不到菜，有时还得跑到通县去，使得三个采购员整天忙得不可开交。签订合同后，不但用不着耽心买不到菜，而且三个人的工作一个人就可干完了。
    通过供销合同，不仅使菜站能够掌握蔬菜购销计划，平衡计划，指导菜农多送或少送，以避免积压和脱销；同时，当某种菜不能满足用菜单位需要的时候，菜站还可根据自己的可能条件，到较远的地方去采购。如前些时各单位订用扁豆的很多，附近农业生产合作社、互助组和个体菜农又没有这么多的扁豆供应，菜站便马上派人到东冉村第一农业生产合作社运回大批扁豆，满足了用菜单位的需要。
    青龙桥菜站是在与投机奸商争夺市场的斗争中建立和发展起来的。菜站刚成立时，菜的品种和数量都少，投机奸商就乘机捣乱，说怪话，“就这几样菜，一买就光，还叫合作社哩！”每当某种蔬菜缺少的时候，他们又以高价收购、低价卖出的手段，制造菜农和消费者对供销合作社的不满。但这些阴谋诡计，终于被人们一一识破和拆穿。如有一位老大娘，贪图沾点小便宜，把四十斤韭菜卖给私商，结果被压了四斤秤，算账时还抹了零，气的她狠狠地责骂奸商们：“从今起，说啥也不上你们奸商的当了。”现在，奸商们的花言巧语再骗不过人们了，如华北行政委员会的一位采购员同志说：“过去尽吃奸商们的亏，现在有了合作社，一定到那里去买，没有的菜换换样也好。”（附图片）
    天桥菜站每天供应着首都人民三十万斤左右的蔬菜。这是菜站正把大批蔬菜卖给市内机关、团体、部队和工矿企业管理伙食单位和广大市民。
