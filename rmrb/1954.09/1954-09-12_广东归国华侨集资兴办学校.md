Overseas Chinese in Guangdong Raise Funds to Establish Schools

    Overseas Chinese returning to Guangdong Province from various regions are actively raising funds to establish schools, aiming to enroll more children of overseas Chinese.

    Recently, the private Taishan Overseas Chinese Middle School, initiated by the Taishan County Overseas Chinese Association of Returned Overseas Chinese in Guangdong Province, has completed its preparations and is scheduled to open on September 15th. This semester, the Overseas Chinese Middle School will open four senior high school classes and two junior high school classes, enrolling a total of more than 300 new students. Returned overseas Chinese in Guangzhou, with the assistance of relevant local authorities, are also preparing to build an Overseas Chinese Primary School. A preparatory committee has been established and is actively planning the construction of the school. Returned overseas Chinese in Haikou, Shantou, Meixian and other places are also actively preparing to build overseas Chinese schools in their respective localities, striving to open them next spring.

    Overseas Chinese and their families in various places are extremely excited about the establishment of overseas Chinese schools. Wang Jianchu, a returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia, donated RMB 1 billion towards the construction of the Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Primary School. Huang Jie, a returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia, also donated 100 million yuan to the private Taishan Overseas Chinese Middle School.

    广东归国华侨集资兴办学校
    广东省各地归国华侨纷纷集资兴办学校，以便招收更多的华侨子弟入学。
    最近广东省侨乡台山县归国华侨联谊会发起兴办的台山私立华侨中学，已经筹办完毕，决定在九月十五日开学。华侨中学在本学期开办高中四班，初中二班，共招收新生三百多人。广州市归国华侨也在当地有关机关协助下准备兴建华侨小学校一所。目前已经成立了筹建委员会，积极筹划建校事宜。海口、汕头和梅县等地归国华侨也正在当地积极筹建华侨学校，并争取于明春开学。
    各地归国华侨和华侨眷属对于兴办华侨学校感到异常兴奋。印度尼西亚归国华侨王健初即为筹建广州华侨小学校捐献人民币十亿元。印度尼西亚归国华侨黄洁也捐献一亿元给台山私立华侨中学。
