    The city of Dimitrovgrad is a mining town in Bulgaria. People in Dimitrovgrad now find it hard to recall the old name of Banik. In the place where there used to be dilapidated and ramshackle shacks for miners, many new multi-story residential buildings and public structures have been erected. From the face of Dimitrovgrad, one can see particularly clearly how rapidly the Bulgarian people are advancing on the road to eliminating the country's historical economic backwardness and on the road to socialist construction, and how far they have already come.

    Dimitrovgrad is Bulgaria's main coal capital. The rapid development of national industry and transportation requires an increasing amount of fuel, and the miners here are striving to meet these demands. Miners' labor is becoming increasingly mechanized, and labor productivity is increasing day by day. There are a large number of highly productive Soviet machines working on the working face, including the Soviet "Donbas" coal mining combine. Due to the increased degree of mechanization of work and the widespread adoption of Soviet advanced labor methods, the miners in the Dimitrovgrad coal region now extract three and a half times the amount of coal for the country as in 1939. Since the establishment of the People's Government, Dimitrovgrad has built a huge machine manufacturing plant for producing machines and equipment for mines - the Stalin Mining Equipment Manufacturing Factory. The Republic Thermal and Power Plant, one of the largest power plants in Bulgaria, has been built in the suburbs. Near Dimitrovgrad, the first ferrous metallurgy factory in Bulgaria, built with Soviet assistance, the "Lenin" National Metallurgical Factory, was put into operation at the end of last year. The commissioning of this factory has laid a solid foundation for the development of the national ferrous metallurgy industry and will promote the further development of heavy industry and machine manufacturing. The factory now has two open-hearth furnaces and two rolling mills in production. The first blast furnace is under construction. By the end of Bulgaria's second Five-Year Plan (1953-1957), this factory will be able to produce hundreds of thousands of tons of steel, pig iron, and steel products for the country, thereby meeting a large part of the national economy's need for steel.

    Simultaneous with the opening of this metallurgical factory, the central flotation ore dressing plant in Dimitrovgrad was also opened, equipped with the most complete Soviet machinery and equipment.

    Since liberation, Dimitrovgrad has also carried out large-scale residential and cultural welfare construction. The housing built for miners in the past few years is equivalent to the housing built in the fifty years under bourgeois rule.

    Before 1944, Banik had only one secondary school. Now there are three secondary schools, one night school, and two labor reserve schools. There is also a mining and metallurgy industrial technical school in the city, where more than a thousand young men and women from all over Bulgaria are studying. There is a model hospital, two well-equipped outpatient clinics, three nurseries, and a maternity hospital. In addition, there are clinics in all mines and enterprises. Dimitrovgrad now has three cinemas, a theater, and a symphony orchestra has also been organized. Not long ago, a House of Technology was opened here and a large stadium, one of the best in the country, was built. This year, the miners will also receive a beautiful Palace of Culture.

    Dimitrovgrad is increasingly becoming a new socialist city in Bulgaria. In the eastern suburbs of the city, a new residential area is being built, centered on the "Lenin" National Metallurgical Factory. Soon, more than 50,000 residents - miners and metallurgical workers - will live here. Wide, tree-lined streets will divide the eastern suburbs of Dimitrovgrad into eleven blocks. A wide asphalt road with trolleybus service will connect the new city and the old city.

### 季米特洛夫城的新面貌

    季米特洛夫城的新面貌
    季米特洛夫城是保加利亚的矿工城。季米特洛夫城的人现在很难想起贝尼克这个旧的名子了。原先是矿工们的破烂不堪、歪歪倒倒的小屋子的地方，现在已耸起了许多多层楼的新住宅和公共建筑。从季米特洛夫城的面貌上就可特别明显地看出，保加利亚人民在消除本国历来的经济落后的道路上，在社会主义建设的道路上是如何迅速地向前迈进，并已经走了多远。
    季米特洛夫城是保加利亚的主要煤都。国家工业和交通运输业的迅速发展要求有日益增多的燃料，这里的矿工正是为满足这些要求而努力。矿工的劳动在日渐机械化，劳动生产率日益提高。在工作面工作的有大量的具有高度生产效能的苏联机器，其中有苏联的“顿巴斯”式采煤联合机。由于工作机械化的程度提高和广泛地采用了苏联的先进劳动方法，季米特洛夫煤区的矿工现在给国家开采的煤达到一九三九年的三倍半。人民政权建立以来，季米特洛夫城建设了一个巨大的为矿场生产机器和设备的机器制造厂——斯大林采矿设备制造工厂。城郊建设了保加利亚最大的大发电厂之一——共和国热力与电力厂。季米特洛夫城附近，在苏联的帮助下建立的保加利亚的第一个黑色冶金厂——“列宁”国家冶金工厂已经于去年年底投入生产。这个工厂的投入生产为国家黑色冶金业的发展打下了坚固的基础，并且将会促进重工业和机器制造业的进一步发展。厂里现在有两个平炉和两台轧钢机在进行生产。第一个高炉正在建设中。到保加利亚第二个五年计划（一九五三—一九五七年）结束时，这个工厂将能为国家生产几十万吨钢、铣铁和钢材，从而满足国民经济对钢铁的很大一部分需要。
    和这个冶金工厂开工同时，季米特洛夫城的中央浮游选矿工厂也开工了，这个工厂是用最完备的苏联机器设备装备起来的。
    解放以来，季米特洛夫城还大规模展开了住宅和文化福利的建设。过去几年为矿工们兴建的住宅相当于资产阶级统治下五十年所建筑的住宅。
    一九四四年前，贝尼克仅有一所中等学校。现在有三所中等学校、一所夜校、两所劳动后备学校。城内还有一所采矿与冶金工业技术学校，在这里学习的有一千多来自保加利亚各地的男女青年。有一所模范医院、两所设备很好的门诊部、三所托儿所、一所产育院。此外，各矿场和企业中都设有诊疗所。季米特洛夫城现在已有三所电影院、一所剧院，另外还组织了一个交响乐队。不久以前这里开设了一所技术之家和建成了一个全国有数的大运动场。今年矿工们还将得到一所美丽的文化宫。
    季米特洛夫城正日益成为保加利亚的一个社会主义新城市。在城东郊，以“列宁”国家冶金工厂为中心的一个新居民区正在兴建。不久，这里将有五万多居民——矿工和冶金工人居住。宽阔、两旁绿树成荫的街道将把季米特洛夫城东郊划分为十一个街区。一条有无轨电车通行的宽阔的柏油马路将把新城和旧城连结起来。
