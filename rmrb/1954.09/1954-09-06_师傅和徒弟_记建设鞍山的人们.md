Master and Apprentice
    ——Remembering the People Building Anshan
    By our reporter Lù Hào

    Wei Shuren's arrival in Anshan didn't seem to fully achieve his wishes. He originally wanted to learn to be a fitter, and never thought about learning to weld. But he was assigned to learn welding.

    After he and several hundred other young people received two months of welding training, they went to the Metal Structure Engineering Company for an internship. Along the way, everyone was laughing and singing, very happy. Only he was listless, and felt unhappy. But he was afraid that others would see it, so he sometimes joked with everyone, and even deliberately put his arm around someone's shoulder to chat for a while, but soon his mouth would naturally pout again.

    He corrected himself again and again, but an unpleasant thought kept disturbing him. He thought: This is the end. I originally hoped to learn to be a fitter, fiddling with steel beams and iron frames, tidying up various machines, which would not only allow me to learn a craft, but also look great, very exciting. Now I have to learn welding. I heard that this work is difficult, you have to wear canvas work clothes even in summer; working at heights is common; all day long, you have to deal with electricity, and if you are not careful, you can hurt your eyes…

    He was only nineteen years old, and according to his age, he should have been a lively young man, but he was usually shy and quiet like a girl. Now, because he was unhappy, he seemed even more reserved.

    When they arrived at the Metal Structure Engineering Company, the welding class leader announced a list, telling everyone which apprentice would follow which master.
      "Who is my master?" Wei Shuren asked.
      "Your master's name is Wang Weizhong."
      "What grade is he?"
      "Eighth grade."
      "Is he middle-aged or young?"
      "He's young, a good young man." When he said this, the class leader seemed particularly happy.

    Wei Shuren wasn't happy to hear this. He thought: How can all the bad things happen to me? People say that older masters are experienced and have skills. When he heard that his master was about the same age as him, he was even more unhappy. He thought: An eighth-grade worker, what experience can he teach me?

    At this time, Wang Weizhong also heard that he was going to take an apprentice. He was also thinking: How can I, with my limited skills, take care of an apprentice? Others are going to call me "master," what if the apprentice doesn't learn well? He was also muttering to himself.

    When Wang Weizhong and Wei Shuren met for the first time, Wang Weizhong said with a smile: "I've only learned a little bit, but even though I don't know much; I will definitely teach you everything I know wholeheartedly, and I won't be conservative."

    Wang Weizhong's first impression on Wei Shuren was: he's energetic, sincere, and looks like he has a good temper. There was no hint of the sternness that the old people said masters had.

    Three days later, the work assignment came down, and they went to the construction site of the seamless steel tube factory to work together. That day, just as they were about to leave, Wei Shuren was going to carry the welding machine, but Wang Weizhong said to him: "You take some odds and ends." With that, he rushed to carry the welding machine with another experienced worker.

    Wei Shuren's first time working with his master was learning to weld a fixed frame. They were working inside the "foundation," and Wang Weizhong asked him: "What have you learned?"
    "I've learned vertical welding, but I'm not skilled."

    Wang Weizhong walked behind him, handed the welding torch to Wei Shuren, and took off his own mask and put it on him, covering his own eyes with a piece of black glass. He told Wei Shuren: "Try welding it."

    He took the welding torch, his hand trembling a little. As soon as he welded, the welding rod stuck to the iron frame, and his work clothes also caught fire.

    Wei Shuren said worriedly: "This is too difficult to learn."

      "I've been learning for two years, and I've only just begun to understand it. How can you expect to learn it all at once?" Wang Weizhong said patiently: "Don't be so anxious. It's not difficult once you know it. If you're afraid of the difficulty, you won't learn it. Study hard and you'll learn it slowly." He immediately put his own hand over his, turned on the power, and the welding torch in Wei Shuren's hand, operated by his master's help, began to work with a whirring sound.

    That day, Wang Weizhong helped Wei Shuren burn six welding rods. When they finished work, Wang Weizhong said: "Okay, if you practice slowly like this, you will be able to work independently soon."

    The next day, Wang Weizhong went to work on the roof frame, and Wei Shuren watched the machine below. After a while, Wang Weizhong shouted to him from the roof frame: "Xiao Wei, come up here and practice too."

    Wei Shuren looked up and saw that the steel beam roof frame, crisscrossing in mid-air, was like a single-log bridge on a steep cliff, high and steep. The people working on it all seemed much smaller. He saw his master sitting nonchalantly on the scaffolding, shouting to him.

    He said: "I can't get up." He thought: If I fall, this is no joke.

    During the break, Wang Weizhong came down. He asked him: "Are you afraid to go up?" He saw that all the other apprentices had gone up, and he was embarrassed to admit that he was afraid to go up. He said: "Wait a minute, I'll go up with you."

    Wei Shuren put on his safety belt and followed Wang Weizhong up the roof frame. At the difficult places to turn, Wang Weizhong wanted to help him, but he refused. He thought: There are so many people working at heights on the construction site, I've never seen anyone who needs help to get up, why do I need someone to support me? In this way, his courage seemed to grow a little, and he went up without hesitation.

    Two weeks later, Wei Shuren was able to start working independently with difficulty. As for working at heights on the roof frame, he was no worse than his master.

    Once, they were welding an oil tank cover, which involved welding two pieces of iron plate together. After Wang Weizhong welded one side, he handed the other side to Wei Shuren. The first welding rod he welded was good, but the second one was too hot, and the welding flux was uneven, so it was crooked and didn't meet the specifications. At this time, the welding class leader came to inspect the work.

    The class leader had sharp eyes. He looked at the oil tank cover and pointed to the problem area and asked: "Who welded this?"

    Wei Shuren was a little scared, his eyes fixed on the ground, not daring to look anywhere. He only heard his master answer: "I welded this."

    The class leader was an experienced old welder. He shook his head and said: "It couldn't have been you, right?"

      Wei Shuren thought: I can't let the master get scolded. He said to the class leader:
  "This wasn't welded by Master Wang; I welded it." This made Master Wang even more embarrassed.

    The class leader didn't say anything else. He didn't seem to blame the apprentice at all. When he left, he told Wang Weizhong: "For this kind of work, you should weld it yourself in the future."

    Wang Weizhong immediately happily reworked and re-welded it, as if everything that had just happened was a matter of course. But Wei Shuren felt very sorry. He thought: This master is even better than my own brother. I can't let the master take the blame for me again.

    The more Wei Shuren worked with Wang Weizhong, the more he realized that his initial wrong views about the master were unacceptable. He now knew that although his master was young, he had the enthusiasm and selfless spirit that our generation generally possesses; although his master's skills were not very high, his sincerity towards him was something that nothing in the world could buy. In these days, he and his master had been working very well together. For some odd jobs, he always tried his best to do them, so that his master could work better. For example, when it was about to start work, he would prepare the welding rods, welding rod buckets, and hats early. When they finished work, he would help his master carry the work clothes and rush to carry the welding machine. He felt that only by doing more work could he justify his master's painstaking training.

    They worked together with mutual respect and love. Five months later, Wang Weizhong was suddenly ordered to be transferred to another construction site.

    Wang Weizhong told Wei Shuren this news. Xiao Wei said: "Can't you ask not to go?"

      "This is the organization's assignment."
      "Then can't you talk to the class leader?"
      "I'm afraid not, the transfer notice has already been issued."
    "Then I'll go with you." Wei Shuren's eyes were a little red.

    Wang Weizhong comforted him and said: "Improve your skills well, working anywhere is serving the people!"

    The next day, Wang Weizhong was leaving. The people who were being transferred and the welding machines were all on the truck. Wei Shuren squeezed beside the truck, reluctantly seeing off his master.

    The truck was about to leave, and the people who were sending them off gradually left, but only Xiao Wei was still standing there motionless. Wang Weizhong said to him more than once: "Go back! Go back quickly!"

    Xiao Wei stood there as if in a daze, perhaps, he turned his face away and cried.

    When Wang Weizhong saw Xiao Wei shedding tears, his own eyes couldn't help but moisten as if they were wrapped in tears. There were many people in the car, and he was embarrassed to cry, so he jumped out of the car, walked to Xiao Wei, and took his hand and said: "Although I am the master and you are the apprentice, look at how well we two get along..." He originally wanted to say a few words to comfort Xiao Wei, but who knew that saying it made him even more sad. Xiao Wei only cried at this time, just like a child.

    Before getting in the car, Wang Weizhong took out a piece of black glass that he had bought from his pocket. This glass had been with him and was an indispensable partner in his work. He gave it to Wei Shuren. He said: "Please accept this piece of glass as a souvenir."

    Xiao Wei refused to accept it. He said: "The public will give me one when I work, you should use it yourself." Wang Weizhong insisted on giving it to him. When Xiao Wei saw that his master was very determined, he finally accepted it.

    Later, the welding class leader learned about this. It just so happened that the construction site needed to continue sending people, and Wei Shuren soon worked with his master again.

    Because Wei Shuren received Wang Weizhong's meticulous help and his own hard work, he gradually became like a skilled welder who could work independently.

    One day at more than five o'clock in the afternoon, when people had already gotten off work, Wei Shuren was suddenly ordered to complete an urgent job for the water station.

    He walked to the water station and saw that there was an eight- or nine-meter-deep "foundation" that had cracked due to rain. If the "foundation" had a problem, the walls of the house above would collapse. Xiao Wei's task was to weld pillars inside the "foundation" to protect the house.

    Because the weather was gloomy, the earth was already in darkness at this time. He crawled under the "foundation" and saw that some side walls had bulged out like a big belly; the cracks in some places were wide enough for an arm to fit into, and pieces of soil kept falling down intermittently. Obviously, it was very dangerous for people to work below. If the "foundation" changed, people would be buried inside the collapsed earthwork and broken walls.

    The concrete inside the "foundation" had not yet been poured, and dense layers of steel bars were intricately interwoven into an iron net. In such a narrow place, he couldn't wear a face shield either. He had to lie on the thorny steel bars, holding a piece of black glass in one hand and a welding torch in the other to work.

    More than an hour later, he completely welded the pillars. He crawled out of the "foundation." Because of the roasting of the electric light, some parts of his red face seemed to have lost a layer of skin, a corner of the towel around his neck was also burned off, and his thick canvas work clothes were soaked with sweat.

    He completed countless difficult and arduous tasks. In February 1953, ten months after Wei Shuren arrived at the construction site, after a technical examination, he was immediately rated as a seventh-grade worker. He simply skipped the eighth-grade worker level. And his master only passed the eighth-grade worker examination after working for one year and nine months.

    Not many days after Wei Shuren was promoted to a seventh-grade worker, the welding class leader led a young man named Zheng Changhai to find him. After the class leader introduced Zheng Changhai to him, he said to him: "He is your apprentice. From now on, you will be fully responsible for him."

    Wei Shuren was stunned. He thought: I am still an apprentice myself, how can I be a master? He said: "Class leader, I haven't learned well myself yet."

    The class leader said: "You teach him as much as you have learned, and that will be considered your completion of the task." With that, he left as if he was very relieved.

    Zheng Changhai was two years older than him and was originally an ordinary worker in the excavation team. On the first day he worked with Wei Shuren, Xiao Wei told him: "You must use black glass to look at the electric light, otherwise your eyes will be injured." He gave him the piece of black glass that Wang Weizhong had given him to use.

    When it was time for dinner, Xiao Wei saw that Zheng Changhai's eyes were a little red. He knew that Zheng Changhai had not listened to him and the electric light had hurt his eyes. He quickly took off his own towel, dipped it in cold water, and applied it to his eyes. And he told him: "Don't worry, it will be fine in a day or two."

    Someone in the dining hall noticed this and immediately gave Wei Shuren an opinion: "Xiao Wei, how can you let your apprentice hurt his eyes when you are a master?"

    Xiao Wei was very sad when he heard this. He said: "It's my fault. I didn't check enough, that's why the problem occurred."

    When Zheng Changhai saw this situation, he rushed to explain to everyone:
  "This is not Master Wei's fault, it's my fault for being curious and not listening to Master Wei."

    Since becoming a master, Wei Shuren has patiently taught Zheng Changhai everything that Wang Weizhong taught him, bit by bit, telling him how to prevent uneven width; how to avoid welding flux skin from falling into the molten iron; how to ensure quality.... During the day, he helped Zheng Changhai's hand to learn welding, just like Wang Weizhong helped his hand to learn welding in the past. At night, he and Zheng Changhai sat next to the welding machine and told him about the structure of the welding machine....

    Two months later, the welding class leader assigned him another apprentice. This apprentice was called Zhang Baoren, and he was one year older than him. He was also an ordinary worker.

    From then on, Wei Shuren worked with two apprentices.

    In our construction site, things like this are very common and ordinary; but when this matter reached his father's ears, the old riveter with more than 30 years of experience, heard that his son had only been in the factory for more than a year and had already taken two apprentices, he thought this was a rare event in history. The old man affirmed and said: "Absolutely impossible, I have been a worker for more than 30 years, and I have only taken one apprentice."

    When Wei Shuren went home, the old man asked him: "What grade worker are you now?"

      "Seventh-grade worker."
      "How is the work going?"
      "It's okay."
      "I heard that you have already taken two apprentices."
      "So-so, I've taken two apprentices."
    "With you being so young, what are you relying on to take two apprentices?" Whether it was intentional, or due to suspicion, or both, the old man asked this way. "Taking apprentices is certainly not based on age," Wei Shuren said in an adult tone: "It's based on the Communist Party's good leadership, the master teaching me with heart, and the apprentices studying hard. As for myself, I just tell my apprentices everything I've learned."

    The old man's joy was indescribable. Afterwards, he would say to everyone: "Everything has changed in the world led by the Communist Party. I only took one apprentice after working for more than 30 years, but my son has only been in the factory for more than a year and has already become the master of two apprentices." A year and a half after Wei Shuren arrived at the construction site, he had already become a sixth-grade welder. His master had been promoted to a fifth-grade worker, his two apprentices, Zheng Changhai became a seventh-grade worker, and Zhang Baoren was already an eighth-grade worker. Almost all of the 881 apprentices who started working with him had also become masters, and many of them were eighth-grade, seventh-grade, or sixth-grade workers.

    Our previous generation and people of the same generation, they had to spend many years in the past, or even a lifetime, to get things that they could not get, but in the new China led by the Communist Party, our happy young people, can get them all in just one or two years, or even just a few months. What we couldn't do, we slowly learned, and our strength is growing so fast.

    师傅和徒弟
    ——记建设鞍山的人们
    本报记者　陆灏
    魏树仁到鞍山来，好像并没有完全达到他的愿望。他本来想学钳工，根本没有想到要学电焊。结果却偏偏被分配去学电焊了。
    他和几百个年青人一起受了两个月的电焊训练以后，就到金属结构工程公司去实习。一路上，大家嘻嘻哈哈，又喊又唱，高兴得很。只有他一个人，没精打采，心里老不痛快。可是他又怕别人看出来，为了这，他有时也随着大家开个玩笑，甚至还故意搭着别人的肩膀闲说一阵，但一会儿，他的嘴又自然而然地噘起来了。
    他一次又一次地纠正着自己，可是一种不痛快的思想一再地扰乱着他。他想：这一下可完蛋了。本来指望学个钳工，摆弄摆弄钢梁铁架，收拾收拾各种机器，既能学到手艺，又看着伟大，多带劲。现在让学电焊，听说这工作很难斗，工作起来，夏天也得穿上帆布工作服；高空作业是平常事儿；一天到晚，要和电打交道，不小心，还会打了眼睛……
    他刚十九岁，按他的年纪，正该是一个活蹦乱跳的小伙子，可是，他平常也总是羞答答地，安静得像个姑娘一般。现在，由于心里不痛快，就显得更腼腆了。
    到了金属结构工程公司，电焊班班长宣布了一张名单，告诉大家哪个徒弟去跟哪个师傅。
      “我的师傅是谁？”魏树仁问。
      “你的师傅叫汪维中。”
      “几级工？”
      “八级工。”
      “是中年还是青年？”
      “是青年，好小伙子。”说到这句话，班长好像露出一种特别高兴的样子。
    魏树仁听了可并不高兴。他想：怎么倒霉的事情都给我碰上了呢？人们都说，年纪大的师傅经验丰富，身上有技术。他听到自己的师傅和他的年纪差不多，心里就更不乐意。他想：一个八级工，能有什么经验教给我。
    这时候，汪维中也听说自己要带徒弟了。他也在想：我这几下子，怎么能带好徒弟呢？别人就要叫我师傅了，结果徒弟学不好怎么办呢？心里也老在嘀咕。
    汪维中和魏树仁两个人第一次见面的时候，汪维中笑着说：“我刚学会一点点，不过，别看我知道得少；但我一定全心把我会的都教给你，决不保守。”
    汪维中给魏树仁的第一个印象是：人挺有精神，诚恳，一看就是好脾气。丝毫没有老人们说过的师傅的那种厉害样子。
    三天以后，工作任务下来了，他们一同到无缝钢管厂的工地去工作。那天刚要动身，魏树仁要去抬电焊机，汪维中给他说：“你拿些零碎的活算了。”说罢，他抢着和另外一个老师傅抬上电焊机走了。
    魏树仁第一次跟师傅干活是学焊固定架。他们钻在“基础”里，汪维中问他：“你学过什么？”
    “学过立焊，不熟练。”
    汪维中走到他的身后，他拿电焊把递给魏树仁，又把自己的面罩摘下来给他带上，自己用一块黑玻璃遮住眼睛。他告诉魏树仁：“你焊焊试试吧。”
    他拿了电焊把，手有些发抖，一焊，焊条就粘在铁架上，工作服也烧着了。
    魏树仁有些发愁说：“这太难学了。”
      “我已经学了两年了，才刚入门，你想一下子学会怎么可能呢？”汪维中耐心地说：“别那么着急，会了不难，怕难就学不会，努力地学，慢慢就学会了。”他马上用自己的手把着他的手，电门一开，在魏树仁手里拿着的由他的师傅帮助他操纵的电焊把，呜呜呜地工作起来了。
    这一天，汪维中帮助魏树仁烧了六根焊条，收工的时候，汪维中说：“行，这样慢慢练习练习，你很快就能独立工作的。”
    第二天，汪维中上房架去工作了，魏树仁在下面看机器。过了一会，汪维中在房架上喊他：“小魏，你也上来练习练习。”
    魏树仁抬头一看，那半空中交错着的钢梁房架，像悬崖削壁上的独木桥似的，又高又陡。在上面工作的人，都好像小了许多，他看见师傅悬空地坐在跳板上若无其事地喊着他。
    他说：“我不会上。”心里想：掉下来，这可不是闹着玩的。
    休息的时候，汪维中下来了。问他：“你不敢上吗？”他看到别的徒弟全上去了，他不好意思承认自己不敢上。他说：“等一会，我跟你一块上去。”
    魏树仁系上了安全带，跟着汪维中上房架了。在转弯抹角难走的地方，汪维中要帮帮他的忙，结果被他拒绝了。他想：工地上有那样多高空作业的人，从来没有见过要人帮忙才能上去的，自己为什么还要别人扶着呢。这样，他的胆子好像就壮了些，结果竟毫不含糊地上去了。
    两个星期以后，魏树仁已经能开始勉强独立工作了。至于高空作业上房架，他比他师傅并不差。
    有一次，焊一种油罐盖，那是要把两块铁板焊接在一起的一种工作。汪维中焊了这一面以后，另外一面交给魏树仁焊。他第一根焊条焊得不错，第二根火大了，焊药不均，结果曲里拐弯，焊得不够规格。恰巧这时候，电焊班班长来检查工作了。
    班长的眼睛很尖，他一看油罐盖，就指着出毛病的地方发问：“这是谁焊的？”
    魏树仁有点害怕，他的眼睛盯在地上，哪里也不敢看。只听他的师傅回答说：“这是我焊的。”
    班长是个老电焊工，有经验，他摇摇头说：“不可能是你焊的吧。”
      魏树仁想：可不能让师傅挨尅。他对班长说：
  “这不是汪师傅焊的；是我焊的。”这一下可把汪师傅反弄得尴尬起来了。
    班长也没有再说什么别的，他倒好像一点也不责备徒弟。临走的时候，他告诉汪维中说：“这样的工作，以后应该亲自焊。”
    汪维中马上乐呵呵地返工重焊，好像刚刚发生的事情，一切都是理所当然的。可是魏树仁心里却很过意不去。他想：这师傅真比自己的亲哥哥还好呢，我可不能再让师傅给我背黑锅了。
    魏树仁越和汪维中在一起工作，他就越觉得开始对于师傅的那些错误的看法太不应该了。他现在知道：师傅虽然年轻，但他却具有我们这一代人普遍所有的热情和无私的精神；师傅虽然技术并不太高明，但他对自己的那种真情，是世界上任何东西也换不来的。在这些日子里，他和他的师傅一直合作得很好。有一些零碎的工作，他总尽可能地抢着去做，以便能让师傅更好地工作。比如要开始工作了，他把焊条、焊条斗子、帽子，早早就准备好了。收工的时候，他帮师傅背着作业服，抢着抬电焊机。他觉得只有多做一些工作，才能对师傅苦心的培养说得过去似的。
    他们就这样互相敬爱地工作着，五个月以后，汪维中突然奉命要调到另外一个工地去了。
    汪维中把这个消息告诉魏树仁。小魏说：“你不能要求不去吗？”
      “这是组织分配的。”
      “那你给班长说说不行吗？”
      “恐怕不行，调动的通知已经下来了。”
    “那我也跟你一块去吧。”魏树仁的眼睛都有点红了。
    汪维中安慰他说：“好好提高技术，在哪里工作也是为人民服务啊！”
    第二天，汪维中要走了。要调走的人们和电焊机都上了卡车，魏树仁挤在车子旁边，依依不舍地送他的师傅。
    卡车快要开了，送行的人都逐渐走了，只有小魏仍站着不动。汪维中不止一次地对他说：“你回去吧！快回去吧！”
    小魏像发呆似地老站在那里，兴许，他就转过了脸，哭了。
    汪维中看到小魏掉眼泪，他自己的眼睛也不禁湿润润地好像被泪水裹住了。车上人很多，他不好意思哭，随即从车上跳下来，走到小魏跟前，拉着他的手说：“虽然我是师傅，你是徒弟，看咱们两个处得这样好……”他本来想说几句话安慰安慰小魏，谁知道一说，自己更难过起来。小魏这时只管哭，真像个小孩子那样。
    汪维中在上车以前，从口袋里掏出一块自己买的黑玻璃，这玻璃随身跟着他，是他工作上离不开的伙伴。他把这送给魏树仁。他说：“请你收下这块玻璃留作纪念吧。”
    小魏不肯收。说：“我工作的时候，公家会发给我的，还是你自己用吧。”汪维中一定要给他，小魏看师傅很坚决，最后还是收下了。
    后来，电焊班班长知道了这件事，恰巧那个工地正需要继续派人去，魏树仁不久就又和他师傅在一起工作了。
    由于魏树仁得到汪维中无微不至的帮助以及他自己的刻苦努力，他逐渐地就像个熟练的电焊工那样能够独当一面地工作了。
    有一天下午五点多钟，人们都已经下班，魏树仁突然奉命要去给水站完成一件紧急的工作。
    他走到给水站，一看，原来那里有一个八九公尺深的“基础”，因为下过雨，“基础”裂了缝，如果“基础”发生了问题，那边上房子的墙壁就会坍塌下来。小魏的任务是要在“基础”里为房子焊支柱，保护房子。
    因为天气阴霾，这时候大地已陷入一片昏暗中。他钻到“基础”底下，看到有的边墙，像个大肚皮那样已经鼓起来了；有的地方的裂缝，胳膊也能伸进去，断续间，土块老往下掉。很显然，人在下面工作，当然是很危险的，万一“基础”发生变化，人就会被塌下来的土方和断墙埋在里头。
    “基础”里面混凝土还没有浇灌，密密层层的钢筋错综复杂地交织成一个铁网。在那样狭窄的地方，护脸罩也不能带，他只好躺在有刺有刃的钢筋上，一只手拿着黑玻璃，一只手拿着电焊把工作。
    一个多钟点以后，他把支柱完全焊好了。他从
  “基础”里爬上来，因为电光的烤射，他的煊红的面孔上，有的地方好像去了一层皮，围在脖子里的毛巾也被烧掉了一个角，全身厚厚的帆布工作服，也被他的汗水浸透了。
    他无数次地完成了艰难困苦的工作。到一九五三年二月，也就是魏树仁到工地十个月之后，经过技术考试，他一下子被评定为七级工。八级工那一节干脆被他跳过去了。而他的师傅是工作了一年零九个月以后才考上八级工的。
    在魏树仁升为七级工没有几天以后，电焊班班长领了一个叫郑长海的年青人来找他，班长将郑长海介绍给他以后，对他说：“他就是你的徒弟，以后，你就要完全对他负责了。”
    魏树仁一愣，他想：我自己还是徒弟呢，怎么能当师傅了。他说：“班长，我自己还没有学好呢。”
    班长说：“你学会了多少，就教给他多少，这就算你完成了任务。”说罢，他好像很放心地走了。
    郑长海比他大两岁，原先是挖土队的普通工。他跟着魏树仁工作的第一天，小魏告诉他说：“你瞅电光，一定要用黑玻璃，不然你的眼睛会受伤的。”他把汪维中给他的那块黑玻璃给他用。
    到了吃晚饭的时候，小魏看见郑长海的眼睛有点发红，他知道是郑长海没有听他的话，电光把眼睛打迷了。他赶紧把自己的毛巾解下来，醮点凉水给他敷上。并且告诉他说：“不要急，过一两天就会好的。”
    饭堂里有人发觉了这件事，马上给魏树仁提意见说：“小魏，你当师傅，怎么能让徒弟把眼睛打了呢？”
    小魏听了很难过。他说：“是我不好。我检查不够，才出了毛病。”
    郑长海一见这情形，他抢着对大家解释说：
  “这一点不怨魏师傅，怨我好奇，没有听魏师傅的话。”
    魏树仁自从当了师傅，他就把汪维中教给他的
  一切东西，耐心地一点一滴地教给郑长海，告诉他怎样防止宽窄不均；怎样避免焊药皮掉在铁水里；怎样保证质量……。他白天，把着郑长海的手学电焊，像过去汪维中把着他的手学电焊一样。晚上，他和郑长海坐在电焊机旁给他讲电焊机的构造……
    隔了两个月，电焊班长又分派给他一个徒弟。这个徒弟叫张宝仁，比他大一岁，也是一个普通工。
    自此以后，魏树仁就带着两个徒弟工作了。
    在我们的工地上，这样的事情很多，也很平常；但这件事情传到他父亲的耳朵里，那个有三十多年工龄的老铆工，听说自己的儿子进厂不过一年多，就带了两个徒弟，他就认为这是千古奇闻了。老人肯定地说：“决不可能，我当了三十多年工人，也只不过带了一个徒弟。”
    趁魏树仁回家的时候，老人问他：“你现在是几级工？”
      “七级工。”
      “工作得怎么样？”
      “还差不多。”
      “听说你已经带了两个徒弟了。”
      “凑合，带了两个徒弟。”
    “你这样一点点年纪，凭什么带两个徒弟呀？”不知是故意，还是由于怀疑，或者两者全有，老人这样问。“带徒弟当然不凭年纪”魏树仁装着大人的口气说：“是凭共产党领导得好，凭师傅用心教我，凭徒弟努力学习，要是说我自己，我不过是把我学会的，全都告诉给徒弟就是了。”　　老人的喜欢是难以形容的。事后，他逢人便说：“共产党领导的天下，一切都改变了。我干了三十多年才带了一个徒弟，我的儿子刚进厂一年多，倒已经当了两个徒弟的师傅了。”在魏树仁到工地一年半以后，他已经成为一个六级电焊工了。他的师傅已经升为五级工，他的两个徒弟，郑长海成了七级工，张宝仁已经是八级工了。和他一起开始工作的八百八十一个徒工，也差不多都当了师傅，很多人都是八级、七级或六级工了。　　我们的上一代和同一代的人，他们过去要花费很多年，甚至花费了一生还得不到的东西，而在共产党领导下的新中国，我们幸福的年青人，只要花费一年两年，甚至是仅仅只要几个月的时间，就能够全部得到了。我们不会的，我们慢慢都学会了，我们的力量就是这样飞快地在成长起来。
