(Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 9th) TASS Moscow, September 9th dispatch: As reported in the newspapers previously, the Soviet government delivered a note to the U.S. government on September 5th, protesting the blatant intrusion of a U.S. military aircraft into Soviet territory in the area of ​​Nakhodka port in the Far East on September 4th.

On September 6th, the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, on the instructions of the U.S. government, delivered two notes to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, refuting the fact that a U.S. military aircraft had intruded into Soviet territory, and insisting that this U.S. aircraft was attacked by two Soviet fighter planes while conducting a "patrol flight" in international waters near the Siberian coast. The U.S. government also insisted that the U.S. aircraft did not fire on the Soviet fighter planes.

On September 8th, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered the following note to the U.S. Embassy.

"Regarding the U.S. government's notes No. 202 and No. 203 of September 6, 1954, the Soviet government deems it necessary to make the following statement.

As stated in the Soviet government's note of September 5th, according to precisely verified facts, a twin-engine 'Neptune' military aircraft intruded into Soviet territory in the area of ​​Cape Ostrovnoy, east of Nakhodka port, at 7:12 PM Vladivostok time (6:12 PM local time) on September 4th. 'When two Soviet fighter planes approached this intruding U.S. aircraft in order to inform it that it had entered Soviet territory and to request it to leave Soviet airspace immediately, the aforementioned U.S. aircraft opened fire on the Soviet fighter planes.' In the face of such hostile and completely unwarranted actions by the intruding U.S. aircraft against the Soviet aircraft, the Soviet aircraft had no choice but to retaliate, after which the U.S. aircraft fled in the direction of the sea. The Soviet government has not received any information regarding the subsequent fate of this intruding aircraft.

In its reply to the aforementioned note of the Soviet government of September 5th, the U.S. government, in its note No. 203, unreasonably denies the facts listed in the Soviet note regarding the blatant intrusion of a U.S. Air Force aircraft into the Soviet border and its completely unwarranted firing on two Soviet fighter planes. At the same time, the U.S. government acknowledges in its note that a U.S. Navy aircraft did fly over the area mentioned in the Soviet note at 6:18 PM local time on September 4th, which is almost consistent with the time stated in the Soviet government's note.

The U.S. government attempts to portray this incident as if this U.S. military aircraft was flying in 'international airspace' while conducting a patrol flight over the area near the Siberian coast, and that it did not fire on Soviet aircraft, but was instead attacked by Soviet aircraft. However, an authoritative government institution such as the U.S. Department of the Navy announced on September 6th that the U.S. aircraft had fired on Soviet fighter planes. Some of the personnel on this U.S. aircraft also admitted in interviews with the press that they had fired on Soviet fighter planes. Therefore, the claim that the U.S. aircraft did not fire at all is inconsistent with the facts.

The U.S. government's note No. 202 also states that this U.S. aircraft encountered Soviet fighter planes in international waters one hundred miles east of Vladivostok. But it is known that the location one hundred miles east of Vladivostok is not in international waters, as stated in the U.S. note, but on Soviet territory. According to U.S. newspaper reports, U.S. Navy officials have had to acknowledge this point.

The facts listed in the Soviet government's note of September 5th, which have been definitively confirmed, as well as the aforementioned statement issued by the U.S. Department of the Navy and the statements made by some of the personnel on this U.S. aircraft, completely refute the claims made in the U.S. government's notes.

The U.S. government, in its note, puts forward a claim that contradicts the definitively established facts regarding the flight of this U.S. aircraft, which violated the Soviet border and unjustifiably shot at Soviet aircraft, and avoids addressing the question of what kind of patrol mission a U.S. aircraft could be performing in Soviet airspace near the 'Siberian coast,' and why U.S. aircraft are constantly being sent to the area of Vladivostok City—which, as is known, is approximately ten thousand kilometers away from the U.S. coast—to conduct 'patrol flights'? In this regard, one has reason to ask: if Soviet military aircraft were to begin conducting 'patrol' flights near the U.S. border—for example, in the San Francisco area—systematically violating this border, and firing on U.S. aircraft protecting the border when they encountered them, what would the U.S. government's reaction be? The U.S. government would not ignore such a thing.

The fact that a U.S. military aircraft intruded into the Soviet Far East border this time, as well as the fact that U.S. aircraft have repeatedly intruded into the Soviet border in the past, undoubtedly proves that these intrusions of the Soviet border by U.S. military aircraft are related to certain definite tasks being carried out by the U.S. military command.

The actions of the U.S. military command, especially the intrusion of a U.S. military aircraft into the Soviet border on September 4th of this year, flagrantly violate the fundamental principles of international law. Such actions can only be regarded as provocative acts aimed at exacerbating the situation in the Far East.

Due to the above, the Soviet government reaffirms its note of September 5th and strongly demands that the U.S. government immediately take steps to prevent the recurrence of incidents in which U.S. aircraft intrude into the Soviet border."

### 就美国军用飞机一架侵入苏联国境事  苏联政府再次照会美国政府

    就美国军用飞机一架侵入苏联国境事
    苏联政府再次照会美国政府
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科九日电：如报纸前时候所报道，苏联政府九月五日交给美国政府一个照会，抗议一架美国军用飞机在九月四日粗暴地侵犯远东纳霍德卡港地区的苏联国境。
    九月六日，美国驻莫斯科大使馆奉美国政府之命交给苏联外交部两个照会，辩驳一架美国军用飞机侵犯苏联国境的事实，硬说这架美国飞机在西伯利亚海岸附近的公海上进行“巡逻飞行”时受到两架苏联战斗机的袭击。美国政府还硬说这架美国飞机并没有向苏联战斗机开火。
    九月八日，苏联外交部把下列照会交给美国大使馆。
      “关于美国政府一九五四年九月六日所提出的第二百零二号和第二百零三号照会，苏联政府认为有必要作下列声明。
    如苏联政府九月五日的照会所说，根据业经精确地证实的事实，一架双引擎‘海王星’式军用飞机，在九月四日海参崴时间十九点十二分（本地时间十八点十二分）侵入纳霍德卡港东面奥斯特洛夫诺伊角地区的苏联国境。‘当两架苏联战斗机接近这架入侵的美国飞机，以便通知它已进入苏联境内并请它立即离开苏联领空时，上述的这架美国飞机竟向苏联战斗机开火。’在入侵的美国飞机对苏联飞机采取这种敌对的和完全无理的行动的情况下，苏联飞机不得不进行还击，后来美国飞机就朝大海的方向逸去。苏联政府没有得到关于这架入侵的飞机随后的遭遇的情报。
    美国政府在答复苏联政府九月五日发出的上述照会的第二百零三号照会中无理地否认苏联照会中列举的关于一架美国空军飞机粗暴地侵犯苏联边境并且完全无端地向两架苏联战斗机开火的事实。同时美国政府在它的照会中承认在九月四日当地时间十八时十八分确有一架美国海军飞机在苏联照会提到的地区上空飞行，这个时间与苏联政府照会中所说的时间差不多是一致的。
    美国政府企图把这件事说成好像是这架美国军用飞机在西伯利亚海岸附近地方上空进行巡逻飞行时是在‘公海上空’飞行的，它没有对苏联飞机开火，而是受到苏联飞机的袭击。可是像美国海军部这样一个权威性的政府机构却在九月六日宣布说这架美国飞机向苏联战斗机开了火。这架美国飞机的人员中有些人在对报界发表的谈话中也承认他们向苏联战斗机开了火。因此硬说美国飞机根本没有开火的说法是与事实不符的。
    美国政府第二百零二号照会还说，这架美国飞机是在海参崴以东一百英里的公海上遇到苏联战斗机的。可是人们知道，海参崴以东一百英里的地点并不如美国照会上所说的那样是在公海上，而是在苏联的领土上。据美国报纸报道，美国海军官员们不得不承认这一点。
    苏联政府九月五日的照会中列举的业经肯定地确定的事实以及美国海军部所发表的上述的声明和这架美国飞机上的人员中的一些人所发表的谈话，完全驳倒了美国政府照会里的那种说法。
    美国政府在它的照会中提出一种和关于这架侵犯苏联国境并毫无理由地射击苏联飞机的美国飞机的飞行方面的业经确定的事实相矛盾的说法，它避而不谈这样一个问题：一架美国飞机能够在‘西伯利亚海岸’附近的苏联领空执行什么样的巡逻任务，为什么美国飞机老是被派往海参崴市地区——人们知道这个城市距离美国的海岸大约有一万公里——作“巡逻飞行”？在这方面，人们有理由问：如果苏联军用飞机开始在接近美国国境的地方——比如说在旧金山地区——作‘巡逻’飞行，有计划地侵犯这个边界，并且在遇见保护边界的美国飞机时向它们开火，美国政府将会有怎样的反应。美国政府对这种事情是不会不闻不问的。
    美国军用飞机这次侵入苏联远东国境的事实以及美国飞机以前屡次侵入苏联国境的事实无可置疑地证明，美国军用飞机对苏联边境的这种侵犯是和美军司令部所进行的某些确定的任务有关的。
    美军司令部的行动，尤其是今年九月四日一架美国军用飞机对苏联国境的侵犯，横暴地违反了国际法的基本原则。这种行动只能被认为是旨在使远东局势恶化的挑衅行为。
    由于以上所述，苏联政府重申它九月五日的照会，并坚决要求美国政府立即采取步骤，防止再发生美国飞机侵入苏联国境的事件。”
