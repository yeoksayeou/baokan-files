    Greeting the First Anniversary of the Publication of the Resolution of the Central Committee of the CPSU on Further Developing Agriculture
    Soviet Agricultural Workers Complete Grain Delivery Plan Ahead of Schedule
    Our Correspondent Li He reported from Moscow on the 6th: Many collective farms and state farms in the Soviet Union are greeting the first anniversary of the resolution of the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU on measures for further developing Soviet agriculture (passed on September 7th last year) by completing their grain delivery plans to the state ahead of schedule as entire oblasts.
    Collective farms and state farms in Moscow Oblast completed their grain delivery plan to the state ahead of schedule on August 31st, delivering 2.1 million poods more grain to the state than on the same date last year, completing 192% of the state's wheat procurement and acquisition plan. Collective farms and state farms in Balashov Oblast completed their grain delivery plan to the state ahead of schedule on September 2nd, delivering 4.5 million poods more grain to the state than last year. Collective farms and state farms in Novgorod Oblast completed their grain delivery plan to the state ahead of schedule on September 3rd, delivering more than twice as much wheat as planned. Collective farms and state farms in Alma-Ata Oblast of the Kazakh Republic completed their grain delivery plan to the state ahead of schedule with 104%. Collective farms delivered and sold 2,321,000 poods more grain to the state than in the same period last year. Collective farms in the Tajik Republic completed their grain delivery plan to the state ahead of schedule with 105%. Collective farms and state farms in the republic are carrying out intensive harvesting of abundant cotton and will deliver carefully selected high-quality cotton to the state.
    All collective farms and state farms that have completed the delivery of grain to the state have retained sufficient seeds, distributed grain to the members as due remuneration for labor days, and continue to sell grain above the plan at state purchase prices.
    In order to ensure a good harvest next year, agricultural workers in many oblasts have completed the sowing plan for winter crops with a high level of agronomy. Moscow Oblast completed the sowing of winter crops before August 30th, greatly exceeding the sowing plan for winter wheat, applying more fertilizer to winter crops than last year, applying a mixture of organic and mineral fertilizers to 70,000 hectares of land, and using narrow-row and cross-sowing methods on large areas of land.

    迎接苏共中央关于进一步发展农业的决议发表一周年
    苏联农业劳动者提前完成缴纳粮食计划
    本报记者李何六日自莫斯科报道：苏联许多地方的集体农庄和国营农场，以整个州提前完成向国家缴纳粮食的计划，来迎接苏共中央九月全会关于进一步发展苏联农业的措施的决议发表一周年（去年九月七日通过）。
    莫斯科州集体农庄和国营农场在八月三十一日提前完成了向国家缴纳粮食的计划，比去年同日多交给国家二百一十万普特谷物，使国家采购和收购小麦的计划完成百分之一百九十二。巴拉梭夫州集体农庄和国营农场在九月二日提前完成了向国家缴纳粮食计划，比去年多交给国家四百五十万普特粮食。诺夫高罗得州集体农庄和国营农场在九月三日提前完成了向国家缴纳粮食的计划，超过计划多交了一倍以上的小麦。哈萨克共和国阿拉木图州集体农庄和国营农场以百分之一百零四提前完成了向国家缴纳粮食的计划。集体农庄比去年同期多交多卖给国家二百三十二万一千普特粮食。塔吉克共和国的集体农庄以百分之一百零五提前完成了向国家缴纳粮食的计划。共和国集体农庄和国营农场正对丰产的棉花进行紧张的收采工作，将交给国家精选的上等棉花。
    所有完成了交粮给国家的集体农庄和国营农场都留下充足的种籽，分配给庄员以应得的劳动日报酬的粮食，并且按照国家收购价格继续超计划出售粮食。
    为了保证明年收成好，许多州农业劳动者以高度农艺水平完成了冬作物的播种计划。莫斯科州在八月三十日前完成冬作物的播种，冬小麦的播种计划大大超过，在冬作物地上比去年多施了肥料，在七万公顷土地上施了有机和矿质混合肥料，大片土地用了窄距和交叉方法播种。
