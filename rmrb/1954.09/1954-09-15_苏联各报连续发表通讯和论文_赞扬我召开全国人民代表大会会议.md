[This report from our Moscow correspondent, Li He]

Soviet newspapers are paying close attention to the convening of our National People's Congress. *Pravda*, *Izvestia*, and *Trud* all published articles or papers on the 14th.

*Pravda* has systematically reported on the nationwide discussion of the draft constitution and the election of people's representatives in our country. Now it has published a dispatch from its reporter: "People's China on the Eve of a Great Event." The dispatch says: The national holiday—the convening of the Chinese National People's Congress—arrives together with the celebration of the Republic's fifth anniversary. China's face has changed beyond recognition in the past five years, from a backward and oppressed country to a strong and free country. The Chinese people are welcoming their great holiday with waving red flags.

*Izvestia* published a paper a few days ago introducing the great unity of all nationalities in our country over the past five years, saying that since its establishment, the People's Republic of China has become "a great and friendly family of free and equal nationalities jointly building a new and happy life." Now it has published a paper "Before the Opening of the Chinese National People's Congress," introducing the election, the draft constitution, and the nationwide discussion of the draft constitution in our country.

*Trud* published a paper entitled "A Great Event in the Life of the Chinese People," describing China's achievements in all aspects over the past five years, the draft constitution, the election, and the labor enthusiasm of the workers in welcoming the holiday. The paper says: "All peace-loving people wholeheartedly congratulate the Chinese people and share their joy for the convening of the Chinese National People's Congress. The work of the Congress is undoubtedly a new step towards further strengthening the power of the great People's Republic of China."
