Xinhua News Agency, September 9th: The Manila Conference convened by the United States to discuss the establishment of a Southeast Asia military bloc concluded on the 8th. After intense behind-the-scenes activities by the United States, the conference almost entirely accepted the draft Southeast Asia treaty proposed by the United States. Representatives from the eight participating countries – the United States, Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Thailand, and Pakistan – signed the treaty on the afternoon of the 8th.

This thing, named the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty," establishes an aggressive military alliance of colonial countries aimed at the people of Asia and China. The treaty stipulates that the signatory countries will "coordinate" their efforts to establish "collective defense," and will "individually and collectively, through continuous and effective self-help and mutual assistance, maintain and develop their respective and collective" armed forces, and "prevent and counter" so-called "subversive activities" within these countries. This means that these countries will expand their armed forces under the direct command and support of the United States, ready for the United States to deploy and use at any time. The influence of the United States will be able to penetrate deep into these countries, interfering in their internal affairs and suppressing the movements of the people of various countries demanding national independence and democratic freedom.

The treaty also stipulates that any country that can serve the United States' aggressive purposes in Asia, even if it is not an Asian country, can participate in this treaty. The treaty designates all territories of Asian signatory countries, as well as the general area of Southeast Asia south of 21 degrees 30 minutes north latitude not belonging to signatory countries, as within the control area of the Southeast Asia group. Moreover, with the unanimous consent of the signatory countries, this controlled area can be expanded arbitrarily.

According to this treaty, the United States can, on the pretext of the existence of so-called "aggression" against any signatory country in this area, or "against any country or territory that the signatory countries may hereafter designate by unanimous agreement," demand that each signatory country "take action in accordance with its constitutional procedures." The United States can also, on the pretext that any signatory country or any other country or territory in this area is subjected to "threats in any manner," demand that the signatory countries immediately consult and take so-called "common defense" measures. Based on these, the United States can at any time use any pretext to drag other countries into aggressive wars manufactured by the United States in Asia, and can use various pretexts to interfere in the internal affairs of Southeast Asian countries, and infringe upon their territorial sovereignty and independence.

The treaty stipulates that each signatory country "guarantees not to participate in any international agreement that conflicts with this treaty," which in practice prohibits signatory countries from engaging in peaceful cooperation with other countries, and obstructs peaceful coexistence among countries.

The treaty stipulates that this treaty shall be effective indefinitely. The signatory countries shall send representatives to form a council "capable of meeting at any time" to "conduct consultations on military planning and any other planning as needed by the situation in the treaty area at any time." Through this council, the United States will be able to further impose various shackles on other countries.

Because the Southeast Asia group's blatant aggressive nature has been strongly condemned by broad public opinion in Asia and the world, the countries participating in the Manila Conference have tried their best to whitewash it, making some insignificant revisions to the treaty draft proposed by the United States.

The original U.S. treaty draft stipulated dealing with so-called "communist aggression," which blatantly showed that the Southeast Asia group was directly targeting the Chinese people and the national liberation movements of the people of Asian countries. The word "communist" was deleted from the final text of the treaty. However, a so-called "U.S. understanding" was attached to the treaty, in which it was stated that, according to the U.S. understanding, the treaty was aimed at so-called "communist aggression." This fully exposed the vicious face of the U.S. aggression group, hostile to the Chinese people and the Asian people.

In the U.S. treaty draft, it was stipulated that Cambodia, Laos, and South Vietnam should be placed under the "protection" of the Southeast Asia group. In the finally signed treaty, this point was not included in the treaty text, but was stipulated separately in a protocol to the treaty, which also stipulated that these Indochinese countries could participate in the "economic measures" of the Southeast Asia group. This protocol, signed by the representatives of the eight countries, and the treaty "shall take effect simultaneously." In fact, whether in the treaty text or the protocol, it shows that one of the purposes of the United States in organizing the Southeast Asia group is to undermine the Geneva agreements on restoring peace in Indochina. Responsible officials of the British and French governments repeatedly declared at the Geneva Conference that the Indochinese countries should not participate in any military group, but their representatives have now signed this protocol, directly violating their promises at the Geneva Conference.

In order to conceal the colonialist nature of the Southeast Asia group, the countries participating in the Manila Conference also passed a so-called "Pacific Charter" proposed by the Philippines and supported by the United States, which mentioned that the Southeast Asia group was "maintaining" the "equal rights" and "national independence" of the people of all countries. But the fact that the so-called "Pacific Charter" was proposed by the Philippines itself, which is a U.S. colony, fully demonstrates that what the Southeast Asia group wants to "maintain" is not the equal rights and national independence of the people of all countries, but the selfish interests of colonial countries in Asia.

Obviously, such revisions or additions have not changed in the slightest, and naturally cannot conceal the ugly essence of the Southeast Asia group. Many sources have pointed out that these painstakingly devised tactics of the countries participating in the Manila Conference, like the inclusion of a so-called "economic measures" clause in the treaty, are all intended to lure other Asian countries into joining the Southeast Asia group.

U.S. Secretary of State Dulles shouted at the end of the Manila Conference that the signatory countries "must support the provisions of the treaty with a strong determination and a spirit of going all out and sacrificing everything." This shows that the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" is precisely the shackle used by the U.S. aggression group to put around the necks of the participating countries, and it is also a tool for the U.S. aggression group to create tense situations in Asia and infringe upon the independence, security, and peaceful lives of the people of Asian countries.

### 马尼拉会议在美国操纵下签订东南亚公约  美国侵略集团敌视亚洲和中国人民的面目完全暴露

    马尼拉会议在美国操纵下签订东南亚公约
    美国侵略集团敌视亚洲和中国人民的面目完全暴露
    【新华社九日讯】美国召集的讨论成立东南亚军事集团的马尼拉会议已于八日闭幕。在美国作了紧张的幕后活动以后，会议差不多全盘接受了美国所提出的东南亚公约草案。参加会议的美国、英国、法国、澳大利亚、新西兰、菲律宾、泰国和巴基斯坦八国代表八日下午已在这个条约上签了字。
    按照这个被定名为“东南亚集体防务条约”的东西所成立的，是一个矛头针对亚洲和中国人民的殖民国家的侵略性军事同盟。条约规定，各缔约国将“统一调度”它们建立“集体防务”的努力，并且将“分别地和共同地以持续的和有效的自助与互助的办法，维持并发展它们各别的和集体的”武装力量，并且“防止和对付”这些国家内部的所谓“颠覆活动”。这就是说，这些国家将在美国的直接指挥和支持之下扩大它们的武装力量，供美国随时调遣使用。美国的势力将得以深入到这些国家内部，干涉它们的内政，镇压各国人民要求民族独立和民主自由的运动。
    条约还规定，凡是能为美国在亚洲的侵略目的服务的任何国家，即令是非亚洲国家，都可以参加本条约。条约把亚洲缔约国的全部领土以及北纬二十一度三十分以南不属于缔约国领土的东南亚的一般地区，都划入了东南亚集团的控制区域内。而且只要经各缔约国一致同意，这个被控制的区域还可以任意扩大。
    根据这个条约，美国可以借口对于这个区域内任何缔约国，或“对各缔约国今后可能经一致协议指定的任何国家或领土”存在所谓“侵略”，来要求每一缔约国“按照它的宪法程序采取行动”。美国还可以借口这个区域内任何缔约国或任何其他国家或领土遭到“任何方式的威胁”，来要求各缔约国立即磋商，采取所谓“共同防御”措施。根据这些，美国就可以在任何时候利用任何借口把其他国家拖入美国在亚洲制造的侵略战争，就可以利用各种各样借口来干涉东南亚国家的内政，侵犯它们的领土主权和独立。
    条约规定，每一缔约国“保证不参加同本条约相抵触的任何国际协定”，这实际上就是不许缔约国与其他国家进行和平合作，阻挠各国间的和平共处。
    条约规定，这个条约要无限期有效。各缔约国要派代表组成“能够随时开会”的理事会，“按照本条约区域情势随时的需要，进行关于军事策划和任何其他策划的磋商”。美国通过这个理事会，就能够把各种枷锁进一步加于其他国家身上。
    由于东南亚集团的露骨的侵略性质遭到亚洲和世界广大舆论的强烈谴责，马尼拉会议与会国家竭力加以粉饰，把美国提出的条约草案作了一些无关大体的修改。
    美国的条约草案原来规定要对付所谓“共产党侵略”，这就露骨地表明东南亚集团是直接针对中国人民，针对亚洲各国人民的民族解放运动的。最后签订的条约本文里删去了“共产党”的字眼。然而，条约却附加了一项所谓“美国的谅解”，其中声明：按照美国的理解，条约针对的就是所谓“共产党侵略”。这充分暴露了美国侵略集团敌视中国人民和亚洲人民的凶恶面目。
    在美国的条约草案中，规定把柬埔寨、老挝和越南南部置于东南亚集团的“保护”下。而在最后签订的条约中，这一点没有列入条约本文，而另在条约的一个议定书中加以规定，这个议定书中并且规定了这些印度支那国家可以参加东南亚集团的“经济措施”。这个由八国代表签字的议定书和条约
  “同时生效”。实际上，不管在条约本文或议定书中，都说明美国组织东南亚集团的目的之一是破坏日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平的协议。英国和法国政府的负责官员曾经在日内瓦会议上一再宣布印度支那各国不得参加任何军事集团，但是它们的代表现在却在这个议定书上签字，直接违背了它们在日内瓦会议上的诺言。
    为了掩饰东南亚集团的殖民主义性质，马尼拉会议与会国家还通过了一个菲律宾提出的，受到美国支持的所谓“太平洋宪章”，其中说到什么东南亚集团是“维护”各国人民的“平等权利”和“国家独立”的。但是由本身就是美国殖民地的菲律宾来提出这样一个所谓“太平洋宪章”，这个事实就充分说明了东南亚集团所要“维护”的并不是什么各国人民的平等权利和国家独立，而是殖民国家在亚洲的自私的利益。
    很明显，这样一些修改或附加，丝毫没有改变，自然也不能掩饰东南亚集团的丑恶的本质。许多消息都指出，马尼拉会议与会国家这些枉费心机的手法，和在条约中列入一条所谓“经济措施”条款一样，都是为了想诱骗其他亚洲国家参加进东南亚集团来。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯在马尼拉会议结束时已叫喊缔约国“要以强大的决心与牺牲一切的全力以赴的精神来支持条约的条文”。这表明“东南亚集体防务条约”正是美国侵略集团用来套在各参与国颈上的枷锁，同时也是美国侵略集团在亚洲制造紧张局势和侵犯亚洲各国人民的独立、安全、和平生活的工具。
