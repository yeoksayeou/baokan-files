(II) It is necessary to constantly crush the sabotage activities of special agents and spies

Recently, the Military Law Department of the Shanghai Military Control Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, based on the prosecution by the Shanghai People's Procuratorate, sentenced a major criminal case involving an American spy who was spying on our country's state secrets and endangering our country's security. This once again exposed the hideous face of the American aggressive bloc, which is hostile to the people of our country, in front of the people of the world.

The principal offender in this case, Redmond, was a professional American spy. In 1946, after receiving spy training at the American "Army Strategic Intelligence Office" in Washington, he was immediately sent to our country to engage in intelligence work. During the tense period of our People's Liberation War in the Northeast in 1947, Redmond and another defendant, the traitor Wang Keyi, went to Shenyang, Changchun, and other places to specifically gather information about the stationing and deployment of our People's Liberation Army, as well as information about our rear economic work, with the aim of undermining our People's Liberation War. After the liberation of Shanghai in 1949, under the orders of American spy agencies in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and other places, and under the direct command of the former American Consul General in Shanghai, and with the active support of American priest Fei Youwen and other imperialist elements lurking within the Catholic Church, he continued to lurk in Shanghai to carry out espionage activities. Relying on traitors such as Wang Keyi and Luo Shixiang, he bought off our public officials, actively developed spy organizations, secretly set up radio stations, and tried every means to spy on and steal our country's state secrets. The intelligence collected by this group of American spies was multifaceted, but mainly consisted of our country's military intelligence, including intelligence on our naval and air force military defense facilities on the Liaodong Peninsula, intelligence on the runways, air defense facilities, types, and quantities of aircraft at Shanghai's airports, intelligence on the firepower of warships on the Huangpu River, intelligence on the military industrial facilities in Northeast and North China, and also air force intelligence on the Boli area of the Soviet Union. The American spy agency in Hong Kong also instructed the traitor Luo Shixiang to "win over" our air force personnel. The activities of these spies were directly coordinated with the American aggressive bloc's conspiracy to invade our country.

From this case, people can see that the American aggressive bloc's sabotage activities of special agents and spies, hostile to the people of our country, are consistent, have been prepared meticulously for a long time, and are an important component of its attempt to launch a new war of aggression against our country. Long before they were forced to withdraw from mainland China, the American aggressors had planned to bury a group of special agents and spies like Redmond and Wang Keyi and other counter-revolutionary elements in our country. After they completely withdrew from mainland China, especially after the aggressive war directly opposing the people of Korea and China also suffered a disastrous defeat, the American aggressive bloc became even more frantically hostile to the people of our country, intensified its special agent and spy activities, and spent a large amount of money to establish a series of special agent and spy strongholds and special agent and spy training institutions around our country. In recent years, these special agent and spy organizations have adopted various means to send a large number of special agents, spies, assassins, and murderers from land, sea, and air, with the aim of undermining our socialist economic construction, national defense construction, and socialist transformation, spying on our country's political, economic, national defense, diplomatic, and other intelligence, carrying out sabotage activities such as blasting, arson, and creating accidents, and seeking opportunities to assassinate our party and government leaders. Since 1953, the number of special agents and spies and other counter-revolutionary elements sent by imperialist special agent and spy agencies, especially the special agent and spy agencies of the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, has greatly increased compared to the past. These special agents and spies are generally deeply buried and act secretively. Some of them have used methods such as employment and schooling to infiltrate our factories, mines, enterprises, schools, state organs, and cultural and educational departments, or used religion as a cover to take the opportunity to carry out counter-revolutionary sabotage activities.

Now, the American aggressive bloc is attempting to create new tensions in Asia and the world, expand armed intervention and threats of war against our country, and especially attempting to obstruct the people of our country from liberating their own territory of Taiwan. For this sinister purpose, they are intensifying their special agent and spy sabotage activities against our country. The so-called "foreign aid" appropriation bill passed by the US Congress on August 12 this year also stipulated a special appropriation of one hundred million US dollars as funds for organizing sabotage and subversion activities in our country, the Soviet Union, and various people's democratic countries. The notorious American spy chief Donovan and the head of the US Army Intelligence Department, Trudeau, have also recently visited Taiwan after many American military and political dignitaries, personally arranging and instructing the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to strengthen special agent and spy activities. According to the "Associated Press," the US Foreign Aid Administration has decided to "subsidize" Chinese "exiles." The American aggressive bloc is massively collecting the social scum spurned by the people of our country, implementing special agent and spy training on them, and asking them to serve the American aggression plan.

Within our country, the remaining counter-revolutionary elements, encouraged by American aggressive activities, are secretly raising their heads again and intensifying counter-revolutionary activities. Some resolute counter-revolutionary elements are trying to "link up" and build relationships with the special agent and spy agencies of the United States and its running dog, Chiang Kai-shek. In the recent tense flood control struggles in many places, the remaining counter-revolutionary elements and various saboteurs have been wantonly creating and spreading rumors, disturbing people's minds, taking the opportunity to steal flood control materials and the people's property, and even frantically digging dikes and releasing water, destroying dikes. Counter-revolutionary elements in border areas are also intensifying their activities, creating chaos, and coordinating with American aggressive activities and the military harassment of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

The joint declaration of the various democratic parties and people's organizations in our country for the liberation of Taiwan pointed out: "In order to liberate Taiwan, our compatriots throughout the country, especially those in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong coastal areas and islands at the forefront of the struggle, must strengthen vigilance, eliminate special agents, and strive to support the People's Liberation Army's struggle against the enemy!" In order to eliminate special agents, spies, and other counter-revolutionary elements, and effectively support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan, party and government leading organs at all levels should intensify education on anti-espionage struggle for staff members and the people; they should be good at systematically exposing the conspiracies of hidden enemies through various means, pointing out the serious harm of special agents, spies, and all saboteurs to our country's socialist construction and the current struggle to liberate Taiwan, explaining the importance of the masses actively participating in the anti-espionage struggle for protecting the country and personal safety, constantly improving the revolutionary vigilance of the masses, so that everyone always has a clear view of the enemy's situation, teaching them some necessary anti-espionage knowledge, and always and everywhere strictly preventing the sabotage of enemy agents and counter-revolutionary elements. For the masses in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong coastal areas at the forefront of the struggle, this kind of propaganda and education work should be done even more carefully, calling on them to strengthen vigilance and resolutely eliminate all special agents. All state organs, enterprises, departments, schools, and organizations should also assist public security organs in doing a good job in mass-based public security work. First of all, it is necessary to strengthen the mass-based anti-espionage work in border areas, factories, mines, enterprises, and organs, and at the same time strengthen and rectify the mass security organizations at the grassroots level in urban and rural areas -- the public security committees, do a good job in controlling counter-revolutionary elements, strictly enforce the household registration management system, and do not give counter-revolutionary elements the opportunity to hide and carry out sabotage activities.

People's public security organs at all levels should focus on protecting the country's socialist economic construction, national defense construction, and socialist transformation, and strengthen investigation work in all aspects in response to the current changes in the enemy's situation. First of all, we must strengthen the investigation work of the economic security department, and strengthen the investigation of special agents and spies sent by imperialism, especially the US imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, so that all special agents and counter-revolutionary elements will be discovered and captured by us before they can sneak in. The investigation work of the people's public security organs must be combined with the work of the civil police in maintaining public order, and with the mass-based anti-espionage struggle, to play a greater role. People's public security organs at all levels should give full play to the enthusiasm and combat effectiveness of public security personnel, resolutely rely on the broad masses of the people, and strive to complete the basic tasks of public security work during the transitional period of the state.

    （二）必须不断粉碎特务间谍的破坏活动
    最近中国人民解放军上海市军事管制委员会军法处根据上海市人民检察署的起诉，判决了一件美国间谍刺探我国家机密、危害我国安全的重大犯罪案件。这在全世界人民面前再一次揭露了美国侵略集团敌视我国人民的狰狞面目。
    这个案件中的主犯雷德蒙是美国的一个职业间谍，一九四六年他在华盛顿美国“陆军战略情报处”受了间谍训练以后，立即被派到我国担任情报工作。
  一九四七年当我人民解放战争正在东北地区紧张进行的期间，雷德蒙和另一被告叛国犯王可一先后到了沈阳、长春等地，专门刺探我人民解放军驻军和调动的情报以及我后方经济工作的情报，目的是破坏我人民解放战争。一九四九年上海市解放后，他在香港、台湾等地美国间谍机关的命令下，在前美国驻上海总领事馆的直接指挥下，在潜伏于天主教内的帝国主义分子美籍神甫斐有文等人的积极支持下，继续潜伏在上海市进行间谍活动。他依靠王可一、罗世祥等叛国分子，收买我公职人员，积极发展间谍组织，秘密架设电台，多方刺探和窃取我国家机密。这批美国间谍所收集的情报是多方面的，但主要的是我国的军事情报，其中有我辽东半岛海军、空军军事防御设施的情报，有上海各飞机场跑道、防空设施及飞机型式和数量的情报，有黄浦江上兵舰火力的情报，有东北、华北军火工业的情报，还有苏联伯力地区的空军情报。香港的美国间谍机关还指使叛国犯罗世祥“策反”我空军人员。这些间谍的活动，是和美国侵略集团对我国的侵略阴谋直接相配合的。
    从这个案件中，人们可以看到：美国侵略集团敌视我国人民的特务间谍破坏活动是一贯的，是经过长期周密的准备的，而且是它企图对我国发动新侵略战争的一个重要组成部分。美国侵略者远在被迫撤出中国大陆之前，就有计划地在我国埋伏了一

  命分子。在他们完全撤出中国大陆以后，特别是在
  直接反对朝中人民的侵略战争也遭到惨败以后，美国侵略集团就更加疯狂地仇视我国人民，加紧了它的特务间谍活动，花费了大量金钱，在我国周围建立了一系列的特务间谍据点和特务间谍训练机构。几年来，这些特务间谍组织采取各种手段把大量的特务、间谍、暗害者和杀人凶犯从陆地、海上和空中派遣进来，以破坏我国的社会主义经济建设、国防建设和社会主义改造为目的，刺探我国的政治、经济、国防、外交等情报，进行爆破、纵火和制造事故等破坏活动，并寻找机会谋杀我党政领导干部。一九五三年以来，帝国主义特务间谍机关、特别是美国和蒋介石卖国集团的特务间谍机关派遣来的特务间谍等反革命分子较以往大为增加。这些特务间谍一般都埋伏较深，活动诡秘，其中已有一些利用就业、就学等方式，钻进了我们的工厂、矿山、企业、学校、国家机关和文化教育部门，或者以宗教为掩护，乘机进行反革命破坏活动。
    现在，美国侵略集团企图在亚洲和全世界制造新的紧张局势，扩大对我国的武装干涉和战争威胁，特别是企图阻挠我国人民解放自己的领土台湾。为着这个罪恶的目的，它们正加紧对我国的特务间谍破坏活动。今年八月十二日美国国会通过的所谓“援外”拨款法案，又规定特别拨款一亿美元，作为它在我国、苏联和各人民民主国家内组织破坏和颠覆活动的经费。臭名远扬的美国特务头子杜诺万和美国陆军情报处长特鲁多，也在最近继许多美国军政要人之后到过台湾，亲自布置和指使蒋介石卖国集团加强特务间谍活动。根据“美联社”的消息，美国援外事务管理署已经决定“接济”中国的“流亡者”。美国侵略集团正在大量收罗我国人民所唾弃的社会渣滓，对他们实行特务间谍训练，要他们为美国的侵略计划服务。
    在我国内部，残余的反革命分子受到美国侵略活动的鼓励，又在暗暗抬头，加紧进行反革命活动。有一些坚决的反革命分子正在设法和美国及其走狗蒋介石的特务间谍机关“挂钩”，拉关系。在最近许多地方的紧张防汛斗争中，残余的反革命分子和各种破坏分子又在大肆制造和散播谣言，扰乱人心，乘机偷窃防汛器材和群众财物，甚至丧心病狂地挖堤放水，破坏圩堤。边防地区的反革命分子也在加紧活动，制造混乱，配合美国的侵略活动和蒋介石卖国集团的军事骚扰。
    我国各民主党派各人民团体为解放台湾联合宣言中指出：“为了解放台湾，我全国同胞，特别是处在斗争最前线的江苏、浙江、福建、广东沿海地区和岛屿的同胞，必须加强戒备，肃清特务，努力支援人民解放军的对敌斗争！”为了肃清特务间谍和其他反革命分子，有效地支援人民解放军解放台湾，各级党政领导机关应加紧对工作人员和人民群众进行防奸反特斗争的教育；要善于通过各种方式，系统地揭露隐蔽敌人的阴谋，指出特务间谍及一切暗害破坏分子对于我国社会主义建设和当前解放台湾斗争的严重危害性，说明群众积极参加防奸反特斗争对于保卫国家和个人安全的重要性，不断地提高群众的革命警惕，使每一个人经常具有明确的敌情观点，教给他们一些必要的防奸反特的知识，随时随地严防敌特反革命分子的捣乱和破坏。对于处在斗争最前线的江苏、浙江、福建和广东沿海地区的群众，更应认真作好这种宣传教育工作，号召他们加强戒备，坚决肃清一切特务。一切国家机关、企业部门和学校、团体，也应该协助公安机关作好群众性的治安保卫工作。首先是要加强边防地区、工厂、矿山、企业、机关的群众性的防奸反特工作，同时也要加强和整顿城乡基层的群众治安组织——治安保卫委员会，作好对反革命分子的管制工作，严密户口管理制度，不给反革命分子以躲藏和进行破坏活动的机会。
    各级人民公安机关应该以保卫国家的社会主义经济建设、国防建设和社会主义改造为重点，针对目前的敌情变化，从各方面加强侦查工作，首先是加强经济保卫部门的侦查工作，加强对帝国主义派遣来的、特别是美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石卖国集团派遣来的特务间谍的侦查工作，要使一切特务间谍反革命分子在混进来以前就为我们发现和捕获。人民公安机关的侦查工作必须与民警治安工作相结合，与群众性的防奸反特斗争相结合，发挥更大的作用。各级人民公安机关应该充分发挥公安人员的积极性和战斗性，坚决依靠广大人民群众，为完成公安工作在国家过渡时期的基本任务而努力。
