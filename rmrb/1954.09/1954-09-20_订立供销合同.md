　　Concluding Supply and Marketing Contracts

After the autumn rains, the vast grasslands of Gannan are even more lush, and the cattle and sheep are at their prime. In order to improve their lives and prepare daily necessities for winter pastures, herdsmen are driving large numbers of livestock to various markets in exchange for grain and industrial products. Since the establishment of the Gansu Provincial Company of the China Food Company Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Region Office, it has signed contracts with trade cooperation departments in Luqu, Maqu, Zhouqu, Zhuoni, Lintan and other places to purchase cattle, sheep and pigs, and has allocated huge sums of money to launch procurement work in various markets. Herdsmen sell large quantities of edible livestock to the state, and purchase the daily necessities they need from trade companies and supply and marketing cooperatives. At present, the office has purchased more than 700 head of cattle and sheep in Xiahe, supplying the needs of cities and industrial and mining areas.

    订立供销合同
    秋雨后，甘南的辽阔草原更丰茂了，牛羊已到了膘肥肉美的季节。牧民为了改善生活，准备冬季牧场用的日常用品，赶着大批的牲畜，前往各个集市，换取粮食和工业品。中国食品公司甘肃省公司甘南藏族自治区办事处成立以来，和碌曲、玛曲、舟曲、卓尼、临潭等地贸易合作部门订立了收购牛、羊、猪的合同，并且调拨巨款，在各集市展开了收购工作。牧民们把大量食畜卖给国家，又从贸易公司和供销合作社购买所需的日用品。现在，该办事处在夏河已收购牛羊肉畜七百余头，供应城市及工矿区的需要。
