    Nanjing Film Machinery Factory
    Successfully Trial-Produces Ukrainian-Type Film Projector
    The Nanjing Film Machinery Factory has successfully trial-produced a Ukrainian-type 16mm film projector (excluding the amplifier section). When using this projector to show movies, the picture is clear, and the brightness is better than the factory's original "200" type projector. Because this projector is lightweight, it is extremely convenient for mobile screenings in rural areas, factories, mines, construction sites, and other places. This projector has a large film platter, which can reduce the number of film changes during the screening process. When screening general films, the "200" type projector needs to change films two to three times in the middle, while this projector only needs to change once.
    The wear resistance of the parts is also strong, and they are not easily damaged. The successful trial production of this projector will play a significant role in more widely meeting the cultural needs of the working people.
    The Ukrainian-type 16mm film projector was designed by the Soviet Union in 1950, and after it was produced, all the drawings were unselfishly provided to our country. The Nanjing Film Machinery Factory began trial production in the first quarter of this year. During the trial production process, engineering and technical personnel and workers jointly overcame the difficulties encountered in the trial production. The first prototype was successfully trial-produced on August 12, and the effect was very good after the trial screening. Small-scale production will begin in September this year.

    南京电影机械厂
    试制乌克兰型电影放映机成功
    南京电影机械厂试制乌克兰型十六毫米电影放映机（不包括扩大器部分）成功。用这种放映机放映电影，画面清楚，光亮度比这个工厂原制“二零零”型放映机更好。因为这种放映机轻便，对供应农村、工厂、矿山、建筑工地等处流动放映，极为方便。这种放映机片盘大，在放映过程中可以减少换片的次数。放映一般影片时，“二零零”型放映机中途要换片两次到三次，用这种放映机只要换一次。
    零件的耐磨性也较强，不易损坏。这种放映机试制成功，对更广泛地满足劳动人民的文化生活需要会起很大作用。
    乌克兰型十六毫米电影放映机是苏联在一九五零年设计的，制成后就把全部图纸无私地供给我国。南京电影机械厂今年第一季度开始试制，在试制过程中，工程技术人员和工人共同克服了试制中所碰到的困难。八月十二日第一台样机已试制成功，试映后效果很好。今年九月份将开始小量生产。
