Xinhua News Agency, August 31st:

    The first National Farmers' Spare-Time Cultural Education Conference, jointly convened by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government and the Literacy Elimination Work Committee of the Central People's Government, began on August 6th and closed on August 16th. The conference held a heated discussion on the report "On the Guiding Principles, Tasks, and Several Issues of Farmers' Spare-Time Cultural Education" made by Qian Junrui, Secretary-General of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Central People's Government. Xi Zhongxun, Deputy Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Central People's Government, gave important instructions to the conference on how farmers' spare-time cultural education should serve the socialist transformation of agriculture. Luo Yi, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, Li Ziyang, Acting Minister of the Propaganda and Education Department of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, and representatives from the People's Armed Forces Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government, respectively, spoke on how the organizations of the Youth League, Women's Federation, and People's Armed Forces Department should cooperate to do a good job in farmers' spare-time cultural education. Finally, Dong Chuncai, Deputy Minister of Education of the Central People's Government, delivered a summary report.

    In the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, this conference, based on the requirements of the general task of the state during the transition period, reviewed and summarized the work of farmers' spare-time cultural education over the past year, discussed and determined the guiding principles and tasks of farmers' spare-time cultural education in the future, and discussed important issues such as strengthening organizational leadership, improving teaching work, and winter school work this year. The conference believes that in the past year, various regions have vigorously rectified the work of eliminating illiteracy in rural areas in accordance with the principle of "rectification and consolidation, steady progress." The tendency of blind advancement has now been corrected, and this work has been initially brought into the orbit of national construction. However, there are still many shortcomings and problems in the current work of farmers' spare-time cultural education. The most important are the unclear guiding principles and tasks, the weak organizational leadership, and some negative emotions in the minds of cadres.

    After discussion, the conference further clarified the important significance of farmers' spare-time cultural education serving the socialist transformation of agriculture and the development of agricultural production. It also exchanged views on the goals of farmers' spare-time cultural education and the development tasks of the first five-year plan. The conference believes that in the future, farmers' spare-time cultural education must closely follow and closely combine with the development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement, actively and systematically eliminate illiteracy among farmers on the basis of production development, and gradually improve farmers' cultural level to meet the needs of socialist transformation of agriculture and the development of agricultural production. The current work of farmers' spare-time cultural education should focus on eliminating illiteracy, especially paying attention to eliminating illiteracy among rural cadres. In areas where the development of agricultural production cooperatives is relatively well-established, attention should also be paid to eliminating illiteracy among young and middle-aged illiterate people among the members and activists of existing agricultural production cooperatives; in general areas, efforts should be made to enroll a part of the members of agricultural production cooperatives, members of mutual aid teams, activists, and other young and middle-aged illiterate farmers, and gradually eliminate a part of illiteracy on the basis of the original work.

    The conference pointed out that farmers' spare-time cultural learning organizations should gradually combine and unify with agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation organizations, especially to establish learning organizations on the basis of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, so that the cooperatives and mutual aid teams can uniformly plan and manage production and learning, uniformly arrange production, work, and learning time, and solve the contradiction between learning and production. The conference especially pointed out that the learning of rural cadres must be valued. Since the main township-level cadres are busy with work and have many meetings, they can adopt methods such as leaving production, semi-leaving production, separate classes, combining individual self-study, and contracted teaching and learning according to different situations.

    The conference discussed the improvement of teaching work and believed that in order to meet the needs of agricultural production in the future, farmers should gradually learn advanced agricultural production scientific knowledge on the basis of learning to read, write, and calculate. For the peasant masses who have eliminated illiteracy, attention should be paid to consolidating their learning results and further improving their political and cultural level; those who have the conditions can form higher primary school classes to learn major courses such as Chinese and abacus. For higher primary school graduates engaged in agricultural production, they should be organized to study on their own, adopting forms such as self-study groups to read popular books and newspapers on politics, agriculture, science, and literature. In areas where conditions permit, rural youth spare-time schools can also be established on a trial basis, absorbing higher primary school graduates engaged in agricultural production to participate. In addition to learning Chinese, attention should be paid to learning production scientific knowledge and cultivating and improving their calculation ability.

    The conference believes that farmers' spare-time education must pay special attention to educating farmers with socialist ideas and improving farmers' political consciousness. In addition to implementing political and ideological education in cultural courses, political courses should be set up in winter schools and people's schools to continue to educate farmers in a specific and in-depth manner on the general line and the constitution, clarify the policy of mutual aid and cooperation, the policy of developing production, the policy of socialist industrialization and the worker-peasant alliance, and combine this with current affairs education to enhance patriotism and internationalism.

    The conference pointed out that farmers' spare-time cultural education must implement "education by the people for the people," mobilize and organize the vast number of literate people to teach the illiterate people, and make every literate person regard teaching people to read as their glorious obligation. Attention should be paid to continuously improving the political, cultural, and professional level of spare-time teachers in order to improve the quality of teaching. The conference believes that farmers' spare-time cultural education must improve teaching methods and improve teaching effectiveness based on the "quick and practical" teaching principles.

    Regarding organizational leadership, the conference believes that leadership must be strengthened for industrial and agricultural spare-time education, and there must be special agencies and full-time cadres responsible for management. Trade unions, youth leagues, women's federations, and people's armed forces departments should actively assist, cooperate, and jointly do a good job in this work.

    In his summary report, Dong Chuncai finally emphasized that to carry out farmers' spare-time cultural education, it is necessary to strive for and rely on party committees at all levels, strengthen leadership, and rely on people's organizations and social forces to cooperate fully. He also called on cadres engaged in farmers' spare-time cultural education across the country to further strengthen unity, overcome difficulties, increase confidence, and strive to complete this glorious and arduous task.

    农民业余文化教育会议闭幕
    确定业余教育的方针：结合互助合作运动，在生产发展基础上提高农民政治文化水平
    【新华社三十一日讯】中央人民政府教育部和中央人民政府扫除文盲工作委员会联合召开的第一次全国农民业余文化教育会议，自八月六日开始，在八月十六日闭幕。会议就中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会秘书长钱俊瑞所作“关于农民业余文化教育的方针任务和若干问题”的报告，进行了热烈的讨论。中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会副主任习仲勋到会对农民业余文化教育如何为农业社会主义改造服务问题作了重要指示。中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记罗毅、中华全国民主妇女联合会宣传教育部代部长李?阳、中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会人民武装部代表，分别就青年团、妇联、人民武装部的组织如何配合作好农民业余文化教育工作问题作了发言。最后，由中央人民政府教育部副部长董纯才作了总结报告。
    这次会议本着批评和自我批评的精神，根据国家在过渡时期总任务的要求，检查和总结了一年多来农民业余文化教育工作，讨论并确定了今后农民业余文化教育的方针任务，讨论了加强组织领导，改进教学工作和今年冬学工作等重要问题。会议认为：在过去一年中，各地根据“整顿巩固、稳步前进”的方针，对农村扫除文盲工作大力进行了整顿，现在已纠正了盲目冒进的偏向，使这一工作初步纳入了国家建设的轨道。但是，目前农民业余文化教育工作中也存在不少缺点和问题，最主要的是方针任务不够明确，组织领导还很薄弱，干部思想上还存在一些消极情绪。
    会议经过讨论，进一步明确了农民业余文化教育必须为农业社会主义改造和发展农业生产服务的重要意义。并就农民业余文化教育的奋斗目标和第一个五年计划的发展任务问题，交换了意见。会议认为：今后农民业余文化教育必须紧紧跟随和紧密结合着农村互助合作运动的发展，在生产发展的基础上，积极地有计划地扫除农民中的文盲，并逐步提高农民的文化水平，以适应农业社会主义改造和发展农业生产的需要。当前农民业余文化教育工作，应当着重扫除文盲，特别要注意扫除农村干部中的文盲，在农业生产合作社发展较有基础的地区，也要注意扫除现有农业生产合作社社员和积极分子中的青壮年文盲；在一般地区，应争取一部分农业生产合作社社员、互助组组员、积极分子和其他青壮年农民中的文盲入学，并在原有工作的基础上，逐步扫除一部分文盲。
    会议指出：农民业余文化学习组织，应当逐步和农业生产互助合作组织结合和统一起来，特别要在农业生产合作社和互助组的基础上建立学习组织，以便由合作社和互助组统一计划、管理生产和学习，统一安排生产、工作和学习的时间，解决学习和生产的矛盾。会议特别指出：必须重视乡村干部的学习。由于主要乡级干部工作忙、会议多，可以根据不同情况，分别采用脱离生产、半脱离生产、单独编班，结合个人自学、包教包学等方式进行学习。
    会议就改进教学工作进行了讨论，认为：为了适应今后农业生产的需要，农民在学习读、写、算的基础上，还要逐步学习先进的农业生产科学知识。对于已扫除文盲的农民群众，应当注意巩固他们的学习成果，并进一步提高其政治文化水平；其中有条件的，可以组成高小班，学习语文、珠算等主要课程。对于从事农业生产的高小毕业生，应组织他们自学，采取自学小组等形式，阅读政治、农业、科学、文艺等通俗书报。有条件的地区，也可以重点试办农村青年业余学校，吸收从事农业生产的高小毕业生参加，除学习语文外，应注意学习生产科学知识和培养与提高其计算能力。
    会议认为：农民业余教育必须特别注意以社会主义思想教育农民，提高农民的政治觉悟。除文化课要贯彻政治思想教育外，冬学、民校中都应当设置政治课，结合农村工作和农民思想情况，具体深入地向农民继续进行总路线和宪法的教育，讲清互助合作的政策，发展生产的政策，社会主义工业化和工农联盟的政策，并结合时事教育，增强爱国主义和国际主义的思想。
    会议指出：农民业余文化教育，必须实行“以民教民”，发动组织广大识字的群众教不识字的群众，要使每一个识字的人把教人识字当成自己应尽的光荣义务。要注意不断提高业余教师的政治、文化、业务水平，以提高教学质量。会议认为：农民业余文化教育必须根据“速成的、联系实际的”教学原则，改进教学方法，提高教学效果。
    关于组织领导问题，会议认为：对工农业余教育工作，必须加强领导，要有专门机构和专职干部负责管理。工会、青年团、妇联、人民武装部门都应积极协助，通力合作，共同做好这一工作。
    董纯才在总结报告中，最后强调指出：开展农民业余文化教育，必须争取和依靠各级党委，加强领导；并依靠人民团体和社会力量，通力合作。他并号召全国农民业余文化教育工作干部进一步加强团结，克服困难，提高信心，为完成这一光荣、艰巨的任务而努力。
