Xinhua News Agency, August 31st: Romanian News Agency, Bucharest, August 29th: Romania's "Spark" published an article entitled "Taiwan Has Been Chinese Territory Since Ancient Times." The article pointed out that recently, the issue of China's Taiwan Island has attracted the attention of the entire public opinion, especially the people of Asian countries. The article wrote that the situation of this island, unreasonably occupied by the U.S. imperialists and its servant Chiang Kai-shek, has long created a very tense situation in the Far East and endangered universal peace. This became even more obvious after the forces of peace achieved great victories through the ceasefires in Korea and Indochina. The People's Republic of China's sovereignty over Taiwan is indisputable. This right has been affirmed and recognized by a series of international agreements. The Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation have solemnly reaffirmed the fact that Taiwan belongs to China. All peace-loving and freedom-loving people sympathize with and fully support the recent statements issued by the People's Republic of China. These statements reiterated the will of 600 million people to liberate Taiwan, unify their country's territory, and eliminate the hotbed of warmongering conspiracies manufactured by the Chiang Kai-shek clique. The article concluded by writing that the working people of the Romanian People's Republic, together with peace-loving people, sympathize with the Chinese people who want to completely liberate their country from the shackles of foreign aggressors and consolidate peace in the Far East and the world.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang: The "Opening New Newspaper," the organ of the Central Committee of the Korean Chondoist Chongu Party, published an editorial on the 27th, stating that the actions of U.S. imperialism in occupying Taiwan and sheltering the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique not only seriously interfere with and infringe upon the sovereignty and security of the People's Republic of China, but also threaten the security of the Pacific region and the peace of Asia and the world. The editorial emphasized: "The actions taken by the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan are for peace and justice, and the Chinese people's struggle will surely be victorious. If U.S. imperialism does not learn the historical lessons from its shameful defeat in the Korean and Indochinese wars and insists on opposing the most legitimate will and demand of the 600 million Chinese people to liberate Taiwan, it will surely suffer another heavy defeat in front of the people of the world."

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 31st: India's Hindi daily "Today" recently published an editorial criticizing the U.S. position of supporting the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. The editorial, referring to Eisenhower's recent statement on preventing the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan and a series of U.S. conspiracies, said: "People do not know according to what democratic principles and ideals the United States constantly interferes in Asian affairs and creates a situation that undermines peace." The editorial said that the Chinese government "has traditional rights over Taiwan, why shouldn't it strive to realize its rights and strive to obtain it?"

The editorial accused the United States of using the defeated and nominal Chiang Kai-shek regime as "a tool to realize its interests and carry out interference." The editorial said: "Supporting the Kuomintang government in Taiwan is not only contrary to democratic principles, but also an action that disregards reality and actual circumstances."

    罗马尼亚“火花报”和朝鲜“开辟新报”指出
    美国庇护蒋匪窃据台湾严重侵犯中国主权
    印度“今天报”抨击美国庇护蒋介石卖国集团的立场
    【新华社三十一日讯】罗马尼亚通讯社布加勒斯特二十九日讯：罗马尼亚“火花报”刊载了一篇题为“台湾自古以来是中国的领土”的文章。文章指出，最近，中国台湾岛的问题吸引了整个舆论特别是亚洲各国人民的注意。文章写道，这个被美帝国主义者和它的仆从蒋介石无理强占的岛屿的情况，早就在远东造成了非常紧张的局势，并危害了普遍和平。在和平力量通过朝鲜和印度支那的停火获得巨大的胜利后，这一点更加明显了。中华人民共和国对台湾的主权是不容置辩的。这种权利是被一系列的国际协定所肯定下来并承认了的。开罗宣言和波茨坦公告已庄严地重申了这个事实：台湾是属于中国的。所有爱好和平和自由的人们同情并全力支持中华人民共和国最近发表的声明。这些声明重申了六亿人民解放台湾、统一他们国家的领土、消灭蒋介石集团制造好战阴谋的温床的意志。文章最后写道，罗马尼亚人民共和国劳动人民和爱好和平的人民一起，同情要使他们的国家从外国侵略者的枷锁下完全解放出来、巩固远东和全世界和平的中国人民。
    【新华社平壤讯】朝鲜天道教青友党中央委员会机关报“开辟新报”二十七日发表社论说，美帝国主义者侵占台湾，庇护蒋介石卖国集团的行动，不但严重地干涉和侵犯了中华人民共和国的主权和安全，而且在威胁着太平洋区域的安全和亚洲及全世界的和平。社论强调说：“中国人民为解放台湾所采取的行动，是为了和平和正义，中国人民的斗争必将获得胜利。如果美帝国主义者不从朝鲜和印度支那战争的可耻惨败中吸取历史的教训，硬要反对六万万中国人民一定要解放台湾的最正当的意愿和要求，它就必定会在全世界人民面前再一次遭到惨重的失败。”
    【新华社新德里三十一日电】印度的印地文日报“今天报”最近发表社论，抨击美国支持蒋介石卖国集团的立场。社论在谈到艾森豪威尔最近发表的关于阻止中国人民解放台湾的声明和美国一系列的阴谋活动时说：“人们不知道美国根据什么样的民主的原则和理想，来不断干涉亚洲的事务而造成一种破坏和平的局势。”社论说，中国政府“对台湾有传统的权利，为什么它不应该为实现它的权利而努力，并力求获得它呢？”
    社论指责美国把被击败了的、有名无实的蒋介石政权作为“实现它的利益和进行干涉的工具”。社论说：“支持台湾的国民党政府不仅是违背民主原则的，而且是不顾现实和实际情况的行动。”
