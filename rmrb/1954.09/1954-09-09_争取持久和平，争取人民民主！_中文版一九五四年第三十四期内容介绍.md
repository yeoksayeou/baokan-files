    "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese Edition, 1954, Issue 34, Contents Introduction
    The Chinese edition of the Cominform organ "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" Issue 34, 1954, has been published.
    To celebrate the 10th anniversary of Romania's liberation, this issue publishes an editorial entitled "The Creative Power of the People in People's Democratic Countries is Flourishing," and also includes an article by Coman Pîrvulescu, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, entitled "The Great Festival of the Romanian People." The editorial points out that the Soviet Union's victory in the Second World War, which was of world historical significance, played a significant role in unleashing the revolutionary creativity of the masses. The achievements of the People's Republic of Romania in the economic and cultural fields vividly demonstrate the flourishing of the creativity of a free people. In a short period of time, the significant social and economic reforms carried out by the people's regime, and the free labor of millions of people for the benefit of the motherland, have changed the face of the country. Romania has transformed from a backward agricultural country into an industrial-agricultural country, with total industrial output increasing two and a half times compared to 1948. Romanian working peasants are increasingly enthusiastically embarking on the road of production cooperation. The welfare and living standards of the working people are also constantly improving. The People's Republic of Romania has opened up vast spaces for the people to develop their talents and for the builders of socialism to display their creativity. Under the invincible banner of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, the Romanian people are steadily advancing along the path of socialism, striving for new and great victories.
    Important articles in this issue include: "Against American Control of Britain" by British Communist Party Deputy General Secretary Joe Matthews, and "The Tenth Anniversary of the Liberation of France and the Struggle Against the Revival of German Militarism" by Maurice Kriegel-Valrimont, Member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party.
    Matthews' article points out that anyone who pays attention to the current political situation in Britain cannot fail to recognize that the British people are generally opposed to the policies and actions of American imperialists. The sharpest opinions against American rulers can be heard from all social strata. The growing intensity of this opposition to American rulers is because the British people are becoming increasingly aware of the great danger that American control poses to Britain. American control over Britain is manifested in the following four aspects: Britain is subjected to American military occupation and becomes an American military base, American restrictions on Britain's foreign trade and the direct intrusion of American economic forces into Britain, the dissemination of American ideological toxins in Britain, and the American imperialists forcing Britain to follow the United States in its foreign policy. Matthews emphasized that the main task of the progressive forces in Britain is to end American control over Britain. The task of the British Communist Party is to point out to the British working people the road to restoring British national independence, to raise the banner of national independence and national sovereignty, and to advance under this banner.
    Kriegel-Valrimont's article was written to commemorate the tenth anniversary of France's liberation from the shackles of Hitler. The article discusses the significance of the armed uprising in Paris in August 1944, the current danger of the revival of German militarism, and the struggle of the French people against the revival of German militarism. The article points out that the French people demand a firm rejection of the "European Defense Community" treaty and acceptance of the Soviet government's proposals to guarantee the security of European countries. In order to eliminate the threat to the peace and security of France and the whole of Europe, it is necessary to prevent any possibility of German militarism carrying out aggression again. The establishment of a pan-European collective security system will greatly help to solve the German problem and reunite Germany into a peace-loving, independent, and democratic country. All the French people must actively participate in the heroic struggle to safeguard the security of the motherland and the whole of Europe, and to ensure that the defeated Nazis will never have the opportunity to plunder and enslave others again.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五四年第三十四期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五四年第三十四期中文版已经出版。
    本期为庆祝罗马尼亚解放十周年，发表了题为“人民民主国家人民的创造力蓬勃发展”的社论，并刊载了罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会政治局委员康·帕伏列斯库的“罗马尼亚全国人民的伟大节日”的文章。社论指出，苏联在第二次世界大战中所取得的具有世界历史意义的胜利，对于发挥人民群众的革命创造性起了显著的作用。罗马尼亚人民共和国在经济和文化方面的成就，生动地证明了自由人民的创造力的蓬勃发展。在短短的时期内，人民政权所进行的重大的社会和经济改革，千百万人民为了祖国的利益而进行的自由劳动，已改变了国家的面貌。罗马尼亚已经从落后的农业国变成了工业—农业国，工业总产量已经比一九四八年增加了两倍半。罗马尼亚劳动农民越来越踊跃地走上生产合作的道路。劳动人民的福利和生活水平也在不断提高。罗马尼亚人民共和国已经为人民发挥自己的才能、为社会主义的建设者施展自己的创造能力，开辟了广阔的场所。在马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的战无不胜的旗帜下，罗马尼亚人民正在稳步地沿着社会主义的道路前进，为取得新的伟大胜利而奋斗。
    本期刊载的重要文章有：英国共产党副总书记乔·马修斯的“反对美国控制英国”和法国共产党中央委员莫·克里埃歇—瓦尔里蒙的“法国解放十周年和反对复活德国军国主义的斗争”等。
    马修斯的文章指出，凡是注意目前英国政治形势的人，都不能不承认英国人民普遍反对美国帝国主义者的政策和行为。从各个社会阶层中都可以听到最尖锐的反对美国统治者的意见。这种反对美国统治者的情绪的日益强烈，是因为英国人民一天比一天明了美国的控制对英国的巨大危险。美国对英国的控制表现在下列四个方面：英国受到美国的军事占领并变为美国的军事基地，美国对英国的对外贸易的限制和美国经济势力直接侵入英国，美国思想毒素在英国的散布，美国帝国主义者强迫英国在外交政策上追随美国。马修斯强调说：英国进步力量的主要任务就是结束美国对英国的控制。英国共产党的任务就是向英国劳动人民指出恢复英国民族独立的道路，就是举起民族独立和国家主权的旗帜，并打着这面旗帜前进。
    克里埃歇—瓦尔里蒙的文章是为纪念法国从希特勒枷锁下解放出来的十周年而写的。文章谈到一九四四年八月巴黎武装起义的意义、目前德国军国主义复活的危险和法国人民反对复活德国军国主义的斗争。文章指出，法国人民要求断然拒绝“欧洲防务集团”条约，接受苏联政府提出的保证欧洲各国安全的建议。为了消除法国和整个欧洲的和平与安全所遭到的威胁，必须防止德国军国主义有再度进行侵略的任何可能性。全欧集体安全体系的建立将大大有助于解决德国问题，把德国重新统一为一个爱好和平的、独立的民主国家。法国全体人民必须积极参加英勇的斗争，保障祖国和整个欧洲的安全，并使被击败了的纳粹分子永远没有机会再掠夺和奴役别人。
