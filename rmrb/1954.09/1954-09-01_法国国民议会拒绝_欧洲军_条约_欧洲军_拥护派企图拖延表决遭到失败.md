Xinhua News Agency, August 31st dispatch: Paris—The French National Assembly, after fierce debate, rejected the plan to establish a "European Defense Community" on the 30th.

On the evening of the 30th, the National Assembly passed, by a vote of 319 to 264, the motion proposed by Social Republican member General Aumeran: The National Assembly refuses to further discuss the ratification of the Paris Treaty and the Bonn Treaty, and removes the issue from the parliamentary agenda. Aumeran, when introducing the motion on the 29th, stated that the "European Defense Community" was an "inappropriate solution." He also stated that the best approach to West Germany was to keep it disarmed.

The "European Army" proponents in the National Assembly, led by leaders of the Popular Republican Movement and the Independent Republicans, tried every possible means to "salvage" this unpopular treaty. As late as the 30th, they also put forward a motion through "Democratic Social Resistance Union" member Alfred Chaban-Delmas, demanding a suspension of the debate and the reopening of the Brussels Conference. However, their plan failed.

When National Assembly Speaker André Le Troquer announced the result of the vote on Aumeran's motion, members opposing the "European Army" treaty applauded and cheered, singing the "Marseillaise"; while those advocating the "European Army" plan pounded on the tables and left the chamber.

Xinhua News Agency, August 31st dispatch: According to a TASS dispatch from Paris: The French National Assembly began a general debate on the bill to ratify the "European Defense Community" treaty on the night of August 29th.

The debate on the 29th began after fierce contention. Before the debate began, "European Army" advocates introduced a motion suggesting postponing discussion of the treaty and reopening negotiations on the "European Defense Community" issue with France's partners. Treaty opponents responded by introducing a "preliminary question." This was introduced by member Aumeran on their behalf. If the National Assembly passed this "preliminary question," it would mean stopping the debate, thus also meaning rejecting the "European Defense Community" treaty. According to procedural rules, the "preliminary question" should be discussed first, that is, before the motion for postponement of discussion put forward by the "European Army" advocates.

The first speaker on the night of the 29th was Le Pen, a member of the Social Republican Party (formerly the Gaullist group). He severely criticized the "European Defense Community" treaty. He resolutely refuted the argument that rejecting the treaty would seem to isolate France, and that West Germany would arm itself without notifying France. He said: "This is an unfounded reason. It is impossible to arm Germany without France's consent. As for talking about isolation, I cannot imagine a more unthinkable isolation than at the Brussels Conference, where five countries united against us." Le Pen believed that establishing a "European Army" would make it impossible to negotiate with the East in the future, and would disintegrate the French army and lead to war.

Subsequently, one of the most fervent supporters of the "European Defense Community," former Prime Minister René Mayer (Radical Socialist Party), spoke. René Mayer insisted that if the treaty was rejected, Germany would still arm itself regardless of France's will, and that the "European Defense Community" seemed to give France "a guarantee" on the issue of arming Germany. In his speech, René Mayer attempted to influence members with the United States' position. He said: "The National Assembly had better think about the fact that if we reject the 'European Defense Community,' it will affect the position of the allies."

Member Coste-Floret (a member of the Popular Republican Movement) also spoke in favor of the "European Defense Community" treaty. However, he said that the treaty was not "perfect," and that he and those who shared his political views agreed to make certain "modifications" to the treaty.

Chaban-Delmas, who spoke at the morning session on August 30th, was one of the members who supported the "European Army," and a member of the right-wing party "Democratic Social Resistance Union." He once again put forward a motion suggesting postponing the debate and resuming negotiations with the other five countries that signed the Paris Treaty.

In this way, the agreement reached between the factions to cancel all motions for "preliminary questions" and begin the debate was broken. Therefore, member Aumeran, representing the faction opposing the "European Army," once again raised the "preliminary question." Thus, the morning session was adjourned.

The Foreign Affairs Committee then met and discussed this situation, passing a motion by a vote of 24 to 20, requesting that the "preliminary question" proposed by Aumeran be put to a vote.

At the resumed National Assembly session on the afternoon of the 30th, Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Daniel Mayer spoke. Mayer accused the faction supporting the "European Army" of creating obstacles and hindering normal debate on the issue. Then Prime Minister Mendès France spoke. He said that the government would not participate in the vote on the "preliminary question" raised by member Aumeran, because the government did not want to link its prestige to the Paris Treaty in its current form. Mendès France said that the government was prepared to support Chaban-Delmas' proposal, but he also said that he would rather have both Aumeran's and Chaban-Delmas' proposals withdrawn so that the debate could continue.

However, in the end, neither of these proposals was withdrawn.

Honorary Speaker of the National Assembly Édouard Herriot said: In his view, the mere fact that Britain was unwilling to participate in the "European Defense Community" was enough to show that France should reject the treaty. He said that he could not agree to the damage to France's sovereignty brought about by this treaty. Herriot said that Article 20 of the treaty was "absurd," as it stipulated that members of the Standing Committee (the leadership body of the "European Defense Community") were prohibited from accepting instructions from their own countries, and were required to forget their nationality in order to have a "supranational" spirit. Herriot asked: "Who would be such unfilial committee members? As for me, I should say that I think the European Defense Community is the end of France." Herriot went on to say that we should end the debate on this important issue immediately. "A peaceful solution should be sought to resolve the disputes in Europe. What should be planned is not the European Defense Community, but another Europe, which unites and is based on reconciliation with Germany and with Russia." Herriot's speech repeatedly aroused applause. After his speech, Christian Pineau of the Socialist Party spoke. Pineau, one of the supporters of the "European Army," firmly advocated postponing the debate and resuming negotiations with the other participating countries in the "European Defense Community" treaty.

Subsequently, a vote was taken on the "preliminary question" -- that is, General Aumeran's motion. As a result of the vote, Aumeran's motion was passed, and the National Assembly rejected the Paris Treaty on the establishment of the "European Defense Community" and the "European Army." Thus, the debate on this issue was terminated. The National Assembly will turn to the next item on the agenda.

### 法国国民议会拒绝“欧洲军”条约  “欧洲军”拥护派企图拖延表决遭到失败

    法国国民议会拒绝“欧洲军”条约
    “欧洲军”拥护派企图拖延表决遭到失败
    【新华社三十一日讯】巴黎消息：法国国民议会在经过激烈的争论以后，三十日拒绝了建立“欧洲防务集团”的计划。
    三十日晚间，国民议会以三百一十九票对二百六十四票通过了社会共和党议员奥麦朗将军的建议：国民议会拒绝进一步讨论关于批准巴黎条约和波恩条约的问题，并从议会议程上取消这个问题。奥麦朗在二十九日提出这个议案时说：“欧洲防务集团”是一个“不适当的解决办法”。他并且说：对西德的最好办法是使它处于解除武装的状态。
    国民议会中以人民共和党和独立共和党领袖为首的“欧洲军”拥护派曾千方百计地想“挽救”这个不得人心的条约。就在三十日，他们还通过“民主社会抵抗联盟”议员艾尔弗雷·舒邦提出一项动议，要求停止辩论，重开布鲁塞尔会议。但是，他们的计划遭到了失败。
    在国民议会议长勒特罗盖宣布奥麦朗建议的表决结果时，反对“欧洲军”条约的议员鼓掌欢呼，高唱“马赛曲”；而鼓吹“欧洲军”计划的人则敲拍着桌子，离开了会场。
    【新华社三十一日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国国民议会在八月二十九日夜晚开始对批准“欧洲防务集团”条约法案进行一般性辩论。
    二十九日的辩论是在经过激烈争执之后开始的。“欧洲军”拥护者曾在辩论开始之前提出议案，建议延期讨论这个条约，并就“欧洲防务集团”问题和法国的伙伴们重新进行谈判。条约反对者对此的答复是提出“先决问题”。这是由议员奥麦朗代表他们提出的。国民议会如能通过这个“先决问题”，那就意味着停止辩论，因此也就等于拒绝了“欧洲防务集团”条约。根据程序规则，“先决问题”应先行讨论，这就是说要在“欧洲军”拥护者提出的延期讨论的议案之先。
    二十九日晚第一个发言的是社会共和党（前戴高乐集团）党员勒庞。他严厉地抨击了“欧洲防务集团”条约。他坚决驳斥这种论调：如果拒绝这个条约法国仿佛就要陷于孤立，而西德将不通知法国而武装起来。他说：“这是毫无根据的理由，没有法国的同意是不可能武装德国的。至于谈到孤立，我想像不出比在布鲁塞尔会议上更为不堪设想的孤立了，在那里，五国联合起来反对我们。”勒庞认为，建立“欧洲军”将使今后和东方进行商谈成为不可能，而且将使法国军队解体和走向战争。
    随后，最狂热的“欧洲防务集团”拥护者之一、前内阁总理雷纳·迈耶（激进社会党）发言。雷纳·迈耶硬说，如果这个条约被拒绝，德国还是会不顾法国的意志武装起来的，“欧洲防务集团”似乎给予法国在武装德国问题上的“一个保障”。雷纳·迈耶在发言中企图用美国的立场来影响议员。他说：“国民议会最好想一想，要是我们拒绝‘欧洲防务集团’，就将影响同盟者的立场。”
    随后发言的议员科斯特·弗洛雷（人民共和党党员）也拥护“欧洲防务集团”条约。但是他说这个条约并不是“完善的”，他和与他政见相同的人都同意对这个条约作某些“修改”。
    八月三十日上午会议上发言的舒邦是拥护“欧洲军”的议员之一、右翼党派“民主社会抵抗联盟”的党员。他再度提出建议延期进行辩论、并和签订巴黎条约的其他五个国家恢复谈判的议案。
    这样一来，各政派之间达成的取消一切“先决问题”动议和开始辩论的协议就被破坏了，因此议员奥麦朗代表反对“欧洲军”的一派再一次提出了“先决问题”。于是上午的会议延期举行。
    外交委员会随即开会讨论了这种局面，以二十四票对二十票通过一项建议，要求对奥麦朗提出的“先决问题”进行表决。
    在三十日下午复会的国民议会会议上，外交委员会主席丹尼埃·麦耶发言。麦耶指责拥护“欧洲军”的一派人制造障碍，妨碍就问题进行正常的辩论。接着由孟戴斯—弗朗斯总理发言。他说，政府将不参加表决议员奥麦朗所提出的“先决问题”，因为政府不愿把自己的威信和现有形式的巴黎条约联系起来。孟戴斯—弗朗斯表示政府准备支持舒邦的提案，但是他又说，他宁愿使奥麦朗和舒邦的这两个建议都取消，以便继续进行辩论。
    但是，结果这两项提案都没有取消。
    国民议会名誉议长爱德华·赫里欧说道：据他看来，单是英国不愿意参加“欧洲防务集团”这一事实，就足以说明法国应该拒绝这一条约。他说，不能同意这一条约带给法国主权的损害。赫里欧说条约第二十条是“荒谬的”，它规定禁止常务委员会（“欧洲防务集团”的领导机构）的委员接受自己国家的指令，要他们忘掉自己的国籍，以便具有“超国家的”精神。赫里欧问道：“究竟谁去做这种六亲不认的委员呢？至于我，我应该说，我认为欧洲防务集团是法国的末日。”赫里欧接着说，我们在这一重要问题上最好是立即结束辩论。“应该寻求和平解决的办法来解决欧洲的纠纷问题，要计划的不是欧洲防务集团，而是另外一个欧洲，这个欧洲所赖以团结和作为基础的是和德国以及和俄国和好。”赫里欧的演说不止一次地引起了鼓掌。在他发言以后，社会党的克里斯吉安·比诺讲话。比诺是“欧洲军”拥护者之一，他坚决主张延期辩论，与“欧洲防务集团”条约的其他参与国恢复商谈。
    随后投票表决“先决问题”——就是奥麦朗将军的建议。投票结果，奥麦朗的建议被通过了，国民议会否决了关于建立“欧洲防务集团”和“欧洲军”的巴黎条约。于是，对这个问题的辩论终止了。国民议会将转而讨论下一议程。
