At the First Session of the First National People's Congress, representatives discussed the government work report. Below are some of the speeches given by the representatives.

**Li Shucheng's Speech**

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully support Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report. I would like to provide some information regarding agricultural production.

Over the past five years, China's agricultural production, as mentioned by Vice Chairman Deng Zihui in his speech, has achieved rapid recovery and development. In 1949, when the country was just liberated, the agricultural production level was about 25% lower than before the War of Resistance Against Japan. By 1952, China's major agricultural products had surpassed the highest levels before the war. The total grain production nationwide reached over 327 billion jin, exceeding the pre-war level by 9%. Cotton production reached over 258 million dan, exceeding the pre-war level by 52%, thus fundamentally changing the situation where the Nationalist government relied on imports of grain and cotton to survive.

In 1953, China began planned economic construction to meet the growing needs of the national economy. Agricultural production faced significant tasks, including increasing the production of grain, cotton, oilseeds, specialty products, livestock, and aquatic products. This year marks the second year of the first Five-Year Plan. Broad masses of farmers and cadres at all levels have bravely fought against the rare floods. In the disaster-stricken areas, efforts were made to drain water, rescue seedlings, and plant late-season crops. In non-disaster areas, efforts were made to achieve over-quota production. Although the planned production of grain, cotton, and oilseeds could not be completed this year, the total production still exceeds last year's level. Livestock and aquatic products can meet the planned targets, and pork production will exceed the plan.

The development of China's agricultural production has proven that, with the completion of land reform and the development of agricultural cooperatives, China's agricultural productivity has significantly improved. The socialist factors in China's agricultural economy are growing. More than 110 mechanized and semi-mechanized state farms, over 2,300 provincial, prefectural, and county farms, 89 state ranches, 19 state-owned aquaculture enterprises, 101 machine tractor stations, and over 100,000 agricultural production cooperatives have been established. Additionally, over 60 million farming households are organized in agricultural mutual aid groups. These economically advanced elements, to varying degrees, and their demonstration and leadership roles among the peasantry provide favorable conditions for the future socialist transformation and rapid development of agriculture.

Over the past five years, the state has issued a large amount of agricultural loans, invested heavily in water conservancy projects, produced and supplied nearly a million new-style animal-drawn agricultural tools, and tens of millions of tons of commercial fertilizers. The state has also implemented tax and price policies to encourage increased production. These measures are material guarantees for the broad masses of farmers to expand reproduction.

At the same time, during the patriotic production movement among the broad masses of farmers, numerous labor models and production experts have emerged. Among them, 553 units and individuals have been awarded by the Ministry of Agriculture, and tens of thousands of outstanding individuals have been commended by local governments. The 57 agricultural labor models attending this conference are the most outstanding representatives among them.

There are over 8,300 agricultural scientific research, experimental, and technical promotion institutions nationwide, with more than 100,000 personnel. This agricultural technical team, guided by the principle of serving agricultural production through scientific research, combines foreign scientific and technological knowledge with the advanced experiences of local masses, relying on mutual aid and cooperative organizations to extensively promote technical improvements such as deep plowing, moisture conservation, reasonable planting density, rational irrigation, fertilizer application, promotion of superior varieties, soil improvement, livestock breeding, and tool improvement. In pest and disease control, the use of pesticides and equipment has become widespread. Notably, since 1951, airplanes have been dispatched annually to control locusts. We have gained control over locusts.

Cadres at all levels have done a lot of work in agricultural production, but there are also subjective shortcomings in our work in the agricultural sector. Due to insufficient attention to the characteristics of China's rural economy and the different production conditions in various regions, many tasks needed by farmers, such as the promotion of new agricultural tools, superior varieties, pesticides, machinery, and chemical fertilizers, have encountered problems in some regions due to general work methods, leading to forced commands, formalism, and dissatisfaction among the masses. In leading state-owned agricultural enterprises, due to lack of experience and extravagant thinking, high costs, low yields, and waste have occurred, weakening the demonstration role that state-owned agricultural enterprises should have. These shortcomings have been greatly rectified, but we must remain humble and cautious, and continue to overcome and rectify them.

Although China's agriculture has made significant progress, small-scale peasant economy still dominates, production equipment is backward, and agricultural products are not abundant. On average, each of the 600 million people in the country has only about 500 jin of grain and 4 jin of cotton per year. Meat and oil products are also limited, and the current situation is already one of supply not meeting demand. Therefore, while developing industry, we must correspondingly and proportionally develop agriculture, increase the production of grain, cotton, oilseeds, and specialty products, and strive to develop livestock and aquaculture.

To complete the arduous task of agricultural production, we must launch a mass agricultural production movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation in rural areas. Agricultural departments at all levels must actively provide assistance to agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups in terms of economy, technology, production and operation, and talent training. At the same time, we must continue to develop and improve state-owned agricultural enterprises to produce more agricultural and livestock products for the country, accumulate funds, train cadres, and demonstrate to farmers, gradually expanding the socialist agricultural base.

The specific measures to ensure agricultural production are to expand cultivated land and increase the yield per unit area. Expanding cultivated land is a necessary step to solve the grain problem. Based on China's situation, the main task is to carry out large-scale reclamation in undeveloped areas. The agricultural department has begun to organize surveys, and it is estimated that the survey and design tasks for 100 million mu of cultivable wasteland can be completed within the first Five-Year Plan.

Increasing the yield per unit area of existing cultivated land is currently the main way to increase agricultural production. China has favorable natural conditions and thousands of years of agricultural experience, coupled with Soviet technical assistance. As long as we make good use of these favorable conditions, we can rapidly develop agricultural production. Currently, we cannot use tractors on a large scale, and the main means of cultivation are animal power and new-style agricultural tools. We must promote double-wheel double-share plows and other new-style animal-drawn agricultural tools in a planned manner; breed livestock in a planned manner; mobilize the masses to accumulate more fertilizer, increase the supply of chemical fertilizers; organize the masses to select and retain superior varieties, gradually expanding the area of superior varieties; strengthen agricultural scientific research and promotion work, establish more agricultural technical promotion stations, gradually achieving one per district. With the development of agricultural cooperatives and the implementation of various production measures, agricultural technological reforms will be more extensively and deeply carried out, promoting further development of agricultural production.

The past reactionary rule and long-term backward production methods have left numerous disasters for agricultural production, which we cannot overcome all at once. Every year, millions of mu of land still suffer from natural disasters such as waterlogging, drought, diseases, and pests. Therefore, the agricultural department, in addition to strengthening plant protection work, must work with the water conservancy department to organize the masses to build water conservancy projects suitable to local conditions, effectively preventing disasters and benefiting the people, reducing the area affected by disasters, and expanding the area benefiting from them. Necessary economic assistance and technical guidance should be provided to farmers in disaster-stricken areas to quickly restore production.

To strengthen the leadership of agricultural production, we must run agricultural colleges well, train cadres, and agricultural department cadres must study theory and policy, learn Soviet agricultural science, summarize and improve the production experience of the Chinese peasantry, go deep into the grassroots, connect with the masses, and improve work styles.

The First Session of the First National People's Congress has pointed out the direction for China's socialist construction.

All agricultural workers should enthusiastically support the Constitution with their actual work and dedicate themselves to the socialist transformation and construction of agriculture with unlimited loyalty.

**Dalaijia's Speech**

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou Enlai's report.

Over the past five years, the Mongolian people of Gansu, under the great national policy of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, have seen fundamental changes in ethnic relations. The old relationships of mutual mistrust and discrimination created by the feudal ruling classes are gradually disappearing, while new relationships of unity, mutual aid, friendship, and cooperation are growing and becoming more consolidated. The establishment of the Gansu Mongol Autonomous Region is a result of the growth and development of these new ethnic relationships. Over the past five years, with the profound changes in ethnic relations, significant development and progress have been achieved in politics, economy, and culture, both in agricultural and pastoral areas, as well as in cities and rural areas. The old faces have been changed. In the pastoral area of Gansu Mongol Autonomous Region, through epidemic prevention and livestock protection work, the number of livestock has increased significantly over the past few years. According to statistics from 1953, camels increased by 138%, and sheep increased by 214%. In the agricultural area of Mengxian County, after land reform, the mutual aid and cooperative movement in rural areas has developed, and now 73% of the total number of farming households have been organized, improving labor productivity. In education, there were no primary schools in the vast grasslands before liberation, but now nine have been established; in Bayanhot City, the number of students has increased by 178%. With the development of the social economy, the material and cultural lives of the people have improved. The various ethnic groups, especially the Mongolian people, have deeply experienced a simple truth from their actual lives: following the Communist Party is happiness.

Our work has achieved certain results, but there are still many shortcomings. The main ones are: our policy level is low, and our work experience is insufficient, so we cannot do a good job according to the policy and combine it with reality. The leadership of agricultural and pastoral production is not deep enough, and the work of summarizing and promoting the advanced production experience of the masses is poor. The propaganda and implementation of the "mutual benefit of herdsmen and herdsmen owners" policy are not enough. All these shortcomings must be deeply learned from. In the future, to make our work go from victory to greater victory, we must continue to implement the cautious and steady policy, strengthen ethnic unity, improve revolutionary vigilance, prevent enemy spies from using various methods to sabotage ethnic unity and construction, and strive to develop agricultural and pastoral production to achieve abundant production and a prosperous population.

Let us, together with all ethnic groups in the country, unite more closely around the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, and strive for the liberation of Taiwan, the implementation of the Constitution, and the construction of a prosperous and happy socialist motherland.

**Hu Ziyang's Speech**

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I listened to Premier Zhou Enlai's report and deeply felt that in the five years since liberation, our country, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, has achieved brilliant achievements in all aspects. I fully agree with and support this report. I participate in the work of the industrial and commercial sector and would like to provide two opinions on the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce:

First, last year I heard Premier Zhou Enlai's speech, saying that the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is a long-term and arduous task. At that time, my understanding of this issue was insufficient. I thought that our work area was small, the situation was simple, and the industrial and commercial sector had undergone the "Five Antis" campaign, and many capitalists had already expressed their desire to take the path of state capitalism. Therefore, my thinking became complacent, and I neglected the process of transforming capitalist industry and commerce, which is a combination of unity and struggle. After studying the general line, and recently conducting a sorting work on the illegal incidents of the Chongqing industrial and commercial sector, I truly felt the long-term and arduous nature of the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. From the results of the democratic appraisal of tax payments by private industrial and commercial households in Chongqing in the first and second quarters of this year, in 52 industries, 85% of the households reported additional taxes, with an average additional depth of 4.5%, and the highest additional amount reached 370 million yuan. Although some of this was due to insufficient understanding and was unintentional, it is enough to show the seriousness of the tax evasion situation. Some capitalists generally act actively in small group meetings, but when someone criticizes capitalists or the bourgeoisie, it is easy to touch their class feelings, and they feel "criticized on the face, hurting the heart"; when they encounter critical moments, they immediately reveal their vulgar essence of seeking profit, forgetting their duty to love the country and abide by the law. There are capitalists in Chongqing who, on the one hand, evade taxes, and on the other hand, indulge in extravagant living, buying a watch worth over 20 million yuan for their wife and exchanging 13 million yuan for their son to pay school meal fees. Isn't this wasting and siphoning off funds? After criticism and education, he himself admitted his mistake. This shows that the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce must be combined with the ideological transformation of capitalists. If the root cause is not dug out and criticized, then at any opportunity, the old disease will relapse. Therefore, I think that only by actively and deeply educating capitalists according to the state plan to operate actively and love the country and abide by the law, can they be transformed in their thoughts, and only then can they happily accept the socialist transformation in their actions.

Second, to carry out the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, it is necessary to strengthen the management of industrial and commercial administrative organs and the leadership of state-owned economic units, and also to organize the supervision of the working masses. According to my understanding, some units' cadres are still busy with their own business work, and lack a proactive attitude towards the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce; for example, the transformation of wholesalers sometimes stays in the stage of repeated understanding and hesitation, and the inspection of specifications for processing and ordering is sometimes too high or too low, and the grasp is not stable, thus bringing unnecessary difficulties to the transformation work. I suggest that relevant departments, in their future work, should further improve the policy level and business level of cadres, strengthen the leadership and management of capitalist industry and commerce, encourage and guide the broad masses of private industrial and commercial workers to take the path of state capitalism as soon as possible. At the same time, in the process of transforming capitalist industry and commerce, those capitalists who have expertise in enterprise management and operational technology should be organized through relevant units to strengthen learning, reward them for their efforts in studying science and technology, and disclose technical secrets. Many old engineers from the capital side, if they have new inventions, can be appropriately rewarded by the state with honor or material rewards, to fully play their role in benefiting the country and the people. It is necessary for the working cadres to have firm confidence and recognize that the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is a long-term and arduous task; but with the leadership of the state power led by the working class, and the continuous efforts and pursuit of transformation by some progressive private industrial and commercial workers, the trend of the times and the will of the people, this work can definitely be gradually done well.

In the end, to ensure the implementation of the Constitution and to support the liberation of Taiwan, I am willing to work with all representatives and the people of the whole country to strive for the implementation of the various tasks proposed in Premier Zhou Enlai's report.

**Qin Yingji's Speech**

Chairman, fellow representatives:

We fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report.

Since liberation, Guangxi Province, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the people's government, has implemented the policy of ethnic equality and promoted ethnic regional autonomy. Especially after the establishment of the Zhuang Autonomous Region in the west of Guangxi, the Zhuang and other ethnic minorities have obtained the right to self-governance and ethnic equality, and a new phenomenon of mutual aid, unity, and friendship has emerged among the ethnic groups, greatly improving political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm, and successfully promoting the construction of various projects in the autonomous region. Under the common demand of the people of all ethnic groups and the agreement of various ethnic leaders connected with the people, land reform has been completed in the entire region, liberating rural productive forces, and farmers' production enthusiasm has reached an unprecedented height, promoting the greater development of agriculture, animal husbandry, and forestry. In 1953, the grain production of the entire region exceeded the pre-liberation level by 30%. In 1951, there was still a shortage of 500 million jin of grain, but in 1953, there was a surplus of 4.42 billion jin of grain for external shipment. To meet the needs of production development, we have paid special attention to the development of trade within the autonomous region, supplying production and living materials for the people of all ethnic groups. Various local products and specialty products, which account for one-third of the people's income, were previously unsalable or had poor sales, but now the problem has been completely solved, thus greatly increasing the people's income. At the same time, with the strong support of the people's government in various aspects, the living standards of the people of all ethnic groups have gradually improved. In the past, many people used wild yams and wild vegetables to fill their stomachs, but now they can mostly eat cooked rice, wear new clothes, and add farm tools and cattle. The situation in education and health has also improved. Now there are 110,000 middle school and primary school students in the entire region, which is more than four times the number before liberation. In the past, there were no hospitals and health stations, but now there are five hospitals and 198 district health stations, and various county health hospitals have been reorganized and expanded, training 9,200 anti-epidemic, anti-malaria personnel, and rural midwives. Historical infectious diseases such as malaria and smallpox have been basically controlled.

The people of all ethnic groups, through the education of the state's transitional period's overall task, have improved their socialist awareness. Currently, 55.8% of the total number of farming households in the entire region have joined agricultural mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and forestry production cooperatives are also being established in key areas. The 8 million people in the entire region are making greater efforts to actively carry out the patriotic production movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation, striving to complete the glorious task of increasing grain production by 18% compared to 1953.

In this series of work, we have adopted the policy of actively cultivating and boldly promoting ethnic cadres. In addition to the township-level government cadres being all ethnic cadres, we have also cultivated more than 20,000 ethnic cadres at the district level and above. These ethnic cadres, with the enthusiastic help of Han cadres from outside, have made rapid progress and growth.

Although we have achieved great results in our work, due to the long-term rule of the reactionary class in the past, the production and cultural level of the people of all ethnic groups are still relatively backward, especially in the mountainous areas where the difficulties are more. This is something we need to gradually solve in the future. At the same time, there are many shortcomings in our work, mainly: the analysis and research of the characteristics of different ethnic regions within the autonomous region are not enough, and there are still generalizations in the work; the promotion of the production of local products, specialty products, and various economic crops is generally advocated, lacking specific organization and leadership; the nationalization of autonomous organs is still not enough; the financial problems at the autonomous region level have not been well solved. We believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, we will definitely be able to overcome these shortcomings and, with full confidence, work together with all ethnic brothers to build a prosperous and happy socialist motherland.

**Yang Xiufeng's Speech**

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report and propose that the conference adopt this report as the basic guideline for future national construction and diplomacy.

Guo Moruo, Ma Xulun, and other representatives have all mentioned that the current quality of education is low and that efforts should be made to improve teaching quality in the future. I agree with these opinions. As an educator, I should strengthen my work and correct my shortcomings. Regarding higher education, to meet the requirement of improving quality, we must solve a series of problems. I will only mention one of them, which is the current situation where higher education teachers spend too much time on social and political activities inside and outside the school and some teachers have too many part-time jobs. Because it is related to various aspects, it cannot be well solved by educational administrative measures alone, so I feel it is necessary to reflect this here and hope to get the attention of all representatives.

Since the founding of the country, teachers from higher education institutions across the country have, through participating in various social and political movements and taking on part-time jobs outside the school, played an active role in national construction, in connecting teaching with practice, and in improving the teachers' ideological level. But according to my understanding, currently, the time teachers spend on social and political activities inside and outside the school and the number of part-time jobs they have are too many.

Currently, higher education teachers, except for a few, generally have about 4 to 6 hours of teaching per week, which is not much, but everyone feels very busy. The reason is that, in addition to spending more time and energy on preparing lessons, learning Russian, compiling textbooks, and improving teaching methods in the process of learning from the Soviet Union, participating in various non-teaching activities and meetings inside and outside the school takes up too much time, which is an important reason. According to the materials of some schools in the past year, on average, teachers spend about 13% of their total annual working hours on social activities, some teachers spend 30%, and a few even more. They do not think that participating in these social and political activities is unnecessary and should not be done, but rather that sometimes the campaigns are continuous, and the attention to teaching work is not enough; sometimes there is a lack of unified arrangement, and the Communist Party, the Youth League, various democratic parties, and trade unions often make arrangements separately, with overlaps and repetitions inside and outside the school, making it difficult for the school leadership to grasp. Moreover, there is often no good consideration of the characteristics of the school, and the arrangements for higher education are the same as for general offices and citizens, with the same requirements, for example, some cities require the study of the Marriage Law in higher education institutions for two months. These situations unnecessarily take up too much of the teachers' time.

Another reason for the teachers being too busy is that some teachers have too many part-time jobs outside of teaching. Many have more than ten part-time jobs, and a few have as many as twenty-five. Because of the many part-time jobs, they often have to go out to work, attend meetings, and are often invited to give speeches, write articles, broadcast, and attend various activities, making them very busy.

Teachers who participate in too many social activities and have too many part-time jobs are almost all the backbone of school administration or teaching and research. Their extra tasks are too heavy, which inevitably affects their work on their posts and teaching and research work to varying degrees, and even affects their health. Therefore, many teachers have conflicts and frustrations in their minds. From the perspective of improving teaching and research work, it is also urgent to solve this problem.

How to solve these problems?

I think, first of all, it must be affirmed: higher education teachers should and must actively and consciously participate in certain social and political activities and some work outside the school. This is necessary for national construction and for teachers to continuously improve their ideological and political level and professional level in practice. It is wrong to only focus on business research and not care about politics and national construction. This is one aspect.

On the other hand, since the basic task of higher education teachers is to engage in teaching and scientific research work. Therefore, all other activities inside and outside the school should be organized and carried out on the premise of being conducive to completing this basic task or minimizing the interference with the completion of this basic task. To quickly and effectively improve teaching quality, it is necessary to concentrate the teachers' energy and time as much as possible on teaching and scientific research work, to fully play their expertise, and to cultivate new forces. Like the situations mentioned above, where teachers' energy and time are unnecessarily occupied, it is urgent to improve them in a planned and step-by-step manner. As for how to ensure teaching quality and gradually develop scientific research on the premise of various situations, reasonably arrange various social and political activities inside and outside the school, and appropriately solve the problem of teachers having too many part-time jobs, in addition to the main planning by the competent authorities and schools, because it involves many aspects, it is also necessary to have the cooperation of all parties to gradually achieve this. For this reason, I reflect this to the conference and ask everyone to correct it.

**Zhang Desheng's Speech**

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support the government work report delivered by Premier Zhou Enlai.

Over the past five years, our country has indeed achieved great achievements in all aspects. The broad masses of the people are excited and enthusiastic because our country is indeed making leaps and bounds forward. Of course, this does not mean that there are no shortcomings in our work. Taking Gansu as an example, over the past five years, the people's government has done many good things for the people, but because we did not deeply understand the correct instructions from the central government, did not fully understand the actual situation of the local area, did not grasp the education of cadres tightly, and the coordination between various departments was not close enough, many shortcomings and errors have occurred. Taking the leadership of agricultural production as an example, after the completion of land reform, especially after the promotion of the state's transitional period's overall task, many farmers actively requested to organize, but the leadership underestimated this new situation. This year, the number of agricultural production cooperatives organized in the entire province has exceeded the original plan by more than three times. Some areas in Gansu have suffered from drought for many years, and we have previously focused on relief, but have not fully recognized the importance of water conservancy, afforestation, and soil and water conservation in Gansu, and have not taken more specific measures to fundamentally solve the problem of drought in Gansu. The natural conditions, economic situation, and farming habits of various regions in Gansu Province are different, but some cadres often do not distinguish between them and treat them the same way. The grassroots cadres are generally good, but because we have often stayed in the office, busy with handling documents, telegrams, and daily affairs, and have gone down to see for ourselves less, and have not helped the grassroots cadres enough, especially lacking systematic and regular education for them, it is inevitable that some cadres, although they often live in the countryside, are indifferent to the new situation in the countryside; some cadres are not good at consulting with the masses to do things, showing simplicity, rigidity, and generalization, affecting the effectiveness of some work, and even sometimes turning good things into bad things. These subjective, one-sided, detached, and detached-from-the-masses shortcomings and errors have not only occurred in the leadership of agricultural production work, but also, to varying degrees, in other work. Some of these shortcomings and errors are inseparable from the relevant business departments of the central government. It is worth our constant attention and prevention in the future. I believe that with the gradual improvement of the people's democratic system and the continuous improvement of the leadership level of cadres, these shortcomings and errors will definitely be gradually reduced and overcome. In the process of overcoming these shortcomings and errors, our work will be continuously improved, and we will definitely obtain further support from the broad masses of the people, and thus, our socialist cause will definitely achieve further development.

**Huang Oudong's Speech**

Chairman, fellow representatives:

The convening of the National People's Congress is a great event in the political life of the Chinese people, a further development of the people's democratic system, and a fundamental issue related to the national construction of China's transition to a socialist society. This conference will have a great impact on the historical process of China and a far-reaching influence. I am very excited and congratulate the success of the conference.

Premier Zhou Enlai, on behalf of the Central People's Government, delivered the government work report, which, on the one hand, explains that since the founding of the People's Republic of China, our country, under the principles set by the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, has carried out tremendous work under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, and has achieved great achievements in politics, economy, culture, national defense construction, diplomacy, and international activities, paving the way and preparing the necessary conditions for China to gradually transition to a socialist society. On the other hand, it points out that in the past few years of victorious struggle, there are still shortcomings in our work, and based on the overall task of China in the transitional period and the reality of our work, it proposes the guidelines and tasks for the future work of the Chinese government. Taking the partial situation of Liaoning as an example, it is the same as the national situation, proving that this report is correct, and I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support it.

The Liaoning region includes the former Liaodong and Liaoxi provinces, and the cities of Shenyang, Dalian, Anshan, Fushun, and Benxi. Over the past few years, under the correct leadership of the central government, relying on the active efforts of all the people and the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, various aspects of work in this region have achieved certain results. Especially in the past few years, because the central government has taken this region as the key point for industrial construction and organized the strength of the whole country to support it, the achievements in industrial construction are relatively greater. The production indicators of state-owned industry and the scale of basic construction are increasing year by year, and many large-scale, technically complex, and modern-equipped enterprises have been built. Many major heavy industries such as metallurgy, fuel, machinery, and electrical equipment account for a large proportion in Northeast China, and the tasks of manufacturing various new products are increasing. Over the past few years, relying on the enthusiasm of all workers to increase production and save resources, labor competitions, the promotion of advanced experience, and the implementation of Soviet experts' suggestions, the enthusiasm and technical level of labor have been continuously improved, and the production and construction tasks have been successfully completed and overfulfilled.

Title: Liaoning's Role and Challenges in China's Socialist Industrialization
Author:

Page: 1

Liaoning is a region where socialist industry is highly concentrated, with many industrial and mining cities, a strong focus on heavy industry, key projects, and agricultural specialties. It plays a crucial role in achieving the country's socialist industrialization. However, over the past few years, the work in this region has been unsatisfactory, with many shortcomings and errors. For instance, in industrial construction, some leaders lack a deep understanding of relying on the working class and completing national plans. Some industrial and mining enterprises have conservative production plans, and there are still instances of excessive and hasty basic construction. The management level of enterprises is low, political work is weak, and there is a lack of political atmosphere. There are many problems in combining political work with economic work, and there is no mature experience in this regard. The importance of learning from the Soviet Union is not fully recognized, leading to insufficient initiative and systematic approach in learning from the Soviet Union. The cultivation of technical personnel is far from meeting production needs, and many new products fail to complete trial production tasks on time. The improvement of product quality, cost reduction, and ensuring safe production have not met the required standards, resulting in uneven and incomplete completion of production plans. In rural areas, the training of district and township cadres is inadequate, and the quality of rural work is low. In mutual aid and cooperation, as well as the promotion of new agricultural tools, there are tendencies of excessive and hasty actions and laissez-faire at different times and to different extents. In local governments at various levels, there are still phenomena of neglecting political and ideological leadership. The transformation of the thoughts of government officials is not thorough enough, the implementation of people's democratic system and democratic centralism is not serious enough, and there are still many instances of bureaucratism. In other areas of work, there are also many shortcomings.

The main reasons for these shortcomings and errors are that some leaders still have varying degrees of individualism and subjectivism, exaggerating their achievements to show their personal influence and authority, fostering a dangerous sense of complacency. They are unwilling to face the shortcomings and errors in their work, do not humbly learn from the experiences of other regions, do not seriously study the policies and directives of the Central Government, do not frequently inspect work on the ground, and lack specific leadership and practical help for the lower levels. This makes it impossible to timely correct and overcome the shortcomings and errors in work, causing significant losses.

Now, Liaoning has been merged into Liaoning Province according to the decision of the Central People's Government. We deeply feel that the tasks we bear are very arduous. In the future, we must closely unite around the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, implement the policies, laws, and directives of the Central Government, strengthen learning, improve ourselves, fully carry forward the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, accept supervision from the masses, learn from past experiences and lessons, overcome complacency, work diligently, and strive for the realization of the country's socialist industrialization.

Xie Juezai's Speech Chairman, Representatives:

I fully agree with Premier Zhou's government work report. Now, I will only express some opinions on relief work and preferential treatment work.

Imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism are the creators of people's disasters. Droughts and poverty have devoured the people. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, our people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, have fought against these disasters. We have regarded disaster prevention, relief, and assistance to impoverished people as political tasks and as work to maintain people's production, rather than as the so-called "charity" of the reactionary rulers of the old era.

Due to the long-term destruction of agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy by the reactionary ruling class, the new water conservancy and afforestation projects have not yet had a significant and widespread disaster prevention effect. Over the past few years, there have been significant natural disasters every year: in 1949, the national disaster area was 120 million mu, in 1950 it was 76 million mu, in 1951 it was 56 million mu, in 1952 it was 66 million mu, in 1953 it was 94 million mu, and in 1954, due to the extremely heavy rainfall in the Jianghuai region, about 160 million mu of farmland was flooded. Our strategy is: when disasters strike, the people's government organizes millions of people to use various methods to fight against drought, frost, pests, and floods, achieving many results where the affected farmland did not suffer from disasters or had reduced disasters; and when disasters have occurred, we implement self-reliant production, frugal living, and mutual aid among the people, and provide necessary relief from the government. Over the past five years, the funds allocated by the state for disaster relief were: 86.87 billion yuan in 1950, 64.23 billion yuan in 1951, 10.126 billion yuan in 1952, 15.134 billion yuan in 1953, and 30 billion yuan in 1954 up to now, and if the additional budget that is still needed is included, the total amount will not be less than this. In addition to the relief in cities and other aspects, the total amount is approximately 110,000 billion yuan. Our relief work mainly aims to maintain the labor force of farmers so that they can continue to engage in sideline production and restore agricultural production, preventing hunger and escape. Although there are still some shortcomings in the disaster relief work, such as insufficient mobilization of the people to organize production, uneven distribution of relief grain and funds, or untimely relief, or relief not provided when needed, generally speaking, the disaster-stricken areas have been able to safely pass through the disasters, protect labor capacity, and restore production.

This year, the floods in the Yangtze River and Huai River are the most severe in nearly a hundred years, and our flood control achievements are unprecedented in history. The Central People's Government and the people's governments of various provinces and regions have provided materials and technical support for flood control, doing whatever is needed as quickly as possible. Local cadres, stationed troops, and the people have fought against the floods with unparalleled courage and enthusiasm, full of confidence. For example, when the dikes at Yangziji in Wuchang faced a dangerous situation this year, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army who participated in the rescue immediately jumped into the water, forming a "human wall" to block the wind and waves, saving the dikes. When a breach occurred in the Jingjiang Dike in Jiangling County, the deputy county magistrate Li Dahan immediately led several people to jump into the floodwaters, using their bodies to plug the hole, saving the situation. Such facts are everywhere. More importantly, the people, with their high spirit of mutual aid and cooperation, have done in-depth and extensive organizational work. For example, Wuhan City has been fighting against the floods day and night for more than two months, but the deployment of the flood control teams and the arrangement of people's production and life have been in perfect order, with no shortages in supplies, and the city's order has remained stable.

In Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, and other provinces, nearly a million disaster-stricken people need to be relocated to nearby or distant areas. In the relocation process, the organization is strict, and the plans are detailed. "Where the disaster-stricken people go, the cadres go"; "take responsibility for taking them out and taking them back." According to administrative units, with mutual aid and cooperation organizations as the core, collective actions are taken in a planned and prepared manner. Along the way, there are supply stations for food, tea, water, and medicine. The clothes, food, and utensils that the disaster-stricken people brought with them are completely intact. Upon arrival, the local people warmly welcome them, providing housing and land, and arranging them in an orderly manner. For the supply of food and materials, there are special ships to deliver them to the doorsteps of the disaster-stricken people. Such a large and effective organizational force is unimaginable in the old era. Without organizing the broad masses of the people in such a planned manner, it would be unimaginable to fight against the floods for a long time or to relocate hundreds of thousands of disaster-stricken people without loss. In the relocation work, only a few areas had shortcomings due to poor preparation.

We have experienced the most severe flood in nearly a hundred years, but the losses have been reduced to the lowest limit. The flood this year far exceeded the water level of 1931, but in 1931, 3.7 million people died from the flood, while this year, the number of people who died from the flood is negligible.

Of course, in this year's flood, there were severe losses of agricultural products, houses, farm tools, livestock, and the destruction of dikes. In addition to the state needing to allocate a large amount of relief grain and funds and arrange a large amount of materials, massive organizational work is also needed, that is, to organize the people to engage in sideline production, repair dikes, houses, and supplement farm tools and livestock, and treat diseases. This is not just about having money; it is about having many methods; it is not just about issuing instructions or orders; it is about working with the people and actually doing it. The disaster-stricken areas should take production and disaster relief as the center, and various departments and aspects must work closely together, act in unison, and through various levels of people's congresses, rely on mutual aid and cooperation to carry out repair work in a planned and step-by-step manner, and vigorously develop production, frugal living, and social mutual aid movements. We have the conditions to overcome disasters. However, we must recognize that there are many difficulties, and we must not relax our efforts to overcome them.

For urban relief, we have also done a lot of work. Prostitution, begging, and drug addiction, which are historical legacies, have basically disappeared. Vagrants have greatly decreased. The vagrants received and reformed by various cities are mostly those who have been reformed and released, while fewer are taken in. The order in cities has taken on a new look. This is mainly due to the development of production, more job opportunities, the improvement of people's awareness, and the unwillingness to fall, while the helpless elderly and disabled have been received and relieved by the government.

The Common Program stipulates: "The families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers who are in difficulty should receive preferential treatment from the state and society. Revolutionary disabled soldiers and demobilized soldiers should be properly arranged by the people's government to make a living and establish a career." Various levels of people's governments have made many efforts in this regard. In various social reform movements, especially in the movement to aid Korea and resist America, the patriotic consciousness of the broad masses of the people has been continuously enhanced, and the work of supporting the military and caring for families has become a widespread, conscious, and mass activity. For the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers who lack labor power, the land is farmed for them and material subsidies are provided; for the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers who have labor power or half labor power, help is provided to organize production; for revolutionary disabled soldiers, subsidies and help are provided to settle down and establish a career, and for demobilized construction soldiers, help is provided to solve living difficulties and introduce jobs, which have generally realized the requirements of the preferential treatment regulations and achieved great results.

It is worth noting that the vigorous development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement has brought happiness and convenience to the families of revolutionary martyrs, revolutionary soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers. Currently, the number of people participating in mutual aid and cooperation organizations has increased significantly. According to statistics from 21 provinces and some counties, the families of revolutionary martyrs, revolutionary soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers participating in mutual aid and cooperation organizations account for more than 60% of the total number of households, and in some regions, it reaches more than 70%. Combined with the superior form of mutual aid and cooperation, in the work of preferential treatment, such as farming land and arranging jobs, there have been many conveniences. At the same time, their participation has also correspondingly developed and consolidated mutual aid and cooperation organizations.

Because the families of revolutionary martyrs, revolutionary soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers have a blood relationship with the revolutionary cause, they generally have a higher level of awareness and good political qualities. In participating in the construction of socialism and the socialist transformation, they have generally shown initiative, and many have become labor heroes and model figures respected by the people. For example, nearly 60% of the returning soldiers in Hebei Province have become village and township cadres, and more than 1,300 people have been elected as labor models. In Guangxi, Liaoning, and other provinces, statistics from seven counties show that more than 330 families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers have been elected as mutual aid group leaders, 45 people have been elected as cooperative society chairmen, and more than 180 people have been elected as representatives of county and township people's congresses. There are also many people elected as representatives of provincial, municipal, and national people's congresses. In 67 revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools, there are more than 50,000 students studying, and more than 10,000 graduates have taken up various positions in the construction industry. And these people who are already working are generally enthusiastic, diligent, disciplined, and praised by the people and various levels of leadership.

Therefore, the staff of various state organs and the people should not only recognize that the families of revolutionary martyrs, revolutionary soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers have contributed their relatives and strength to the revolutionary cause and should be respected and cared for by the state and the people; but also recognize that they are the protectors of the people and the state on the front lines and active factors in social construction on the home front. We should recognize that preferential treatment work is an important work for building and consolidating modern national defense, opposing imperialist aggression, and an important work for building a prosperous and happy socialist society.

Although the preferential treatment work has achieved the above-mentioned achievements, there are still many shortcomings. Now, in some places, the mobilization and organization of their participation in production have not been highly valued; in some places, preferential treatment funds have been accumulated, and the difficulties in production and life of the families of revolutionary martyrs, revolutionary soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers have not been seriously solved; in some places, preferential treatment funds have been distributed evenly, or funds that should not be distributed have been distributed, failing to play an active role in material assistance and production support; in some places, the demobilized construction soldiers with difficulties have not been taken full responsibility for and settled; in some places, the thought that some people do not want to actively engage in labor production but rely on preferential treatment has not been timely and effectively educated and corrected. These shortcomings, although few, are not a small number. These shortcomings are inseparable from the bureaucratic style of our leading organs. In the future, we need to use great efforts to overcome them.

Ruzhong Anping's Speech Chairman, Representatives:

I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou's government work report.

In the half month before the opening of the conference, I was traveling in Yili, Xinjiang. During the trip, I deeply felt that the Chinese Communist Party and the people's government are truly serving the people, and the words of Premier Zhou in the report, "All our work is for the people," are completely true. The several counties in the eastern part of Yili that I traveled to are mainly engaged in livestock farming. Everywhere I went, I visited some herdsmen. They all told me that in the past few years, the livestock have increased, and their lives have improved year by year. The Communist Party and the people's government have always cared for them and provided them with various specific help. They said that in the past, during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, winter was a critical period, and many livestock would die every winter. But now, before autumn arrives, the government teaches the herdsmen to raise good autumn fat, so that the sheep can safely survive the winter; before winter arrives, the government calls on the herdsmen to hurry up and cut grass, so that the livestock will not starve in winter. This spring, some herdsmen's winter grass has already been used up, and the situation is very difficult, but the government has timely provided loans for buying grass and mobilized herdsmen with surplus grass to sell the excess to herdsmen who lack grass. Under the care and help of the Communist Party and the people's government, the difficulties that herdsmen encounter in winter have been greatly reduced compared to the past. Wolves are also a major harm to livestock. But in the past few years, the government has led the herdsmen to organize wolf-hunting teams, providing the herdsmen with wolf-hunting rifles, bullets, and wolf traps. Generally speaking, the wolf harm in various places has been reduced to varying degrees, and both people and livestock have been protected. In the past, livestock often suffered from diseases, some of which were serious infectious diseases, and once they occurred, they would cause large-scale deaths. In the past few years, due to the government's regular dispatch of veterinarians with medicines to various pastoral areas for prevention and treatment, the diseases in livestock have been greatly reduced, and there have been no major infectious diseases in recent years. In the past, sheep often had scabies, but now the government provides low-priced medicine to the herdsmen, and sheep no longer have scabies.

The Communist Party and the people's government have also taught and helped the herdsmen in many ways to develop production. For example, they regularly propagate the improvement of breeds; regarding this, it has caused a widespread and profound reaction among the herdsmen. Many herdsmen mentioned to me the advantages of improving breeds. They said that one kilogram of wool from a local breed of Kazakh sheep can only be sold for about 10,000 yuan, but one kilogram of wool from an improved breed of Xinjiang sheep can be sold for more than 40,000 yuan; moreover, Xinjiang sheep wool is three to four times more than Kazakh sheep wool. The milk and meat of Xinjiang sheep are also much more than those of Kazakh sheep. The government not only propagates the advantages of improving breeds to the herdsmen but also often lends breeding sheep to the herdsmen, to be repaid after two or three years. Several herdsmen said that the breeding sheep they borrowed had, within these two years, not only produced lambs that could repay the loan, but the wool they grew could also repay the loan.

The lives of herdsmen have improved significantly in the past few years, and compared to the period of Kuomintang reactionary rule, it is simply incomparable. On the one hand, in the past, livestock products were not valuable, but now the state purchases livestock products, and the prices of livestock products are much higher than before. Take intestines, for example; in the past, no one wanted them, and they were completely worthless, but now the trading company purchases them, and herdsmen can exchange one intestine for 20 boxes of matches; on the other hand, the prices of daily necessities have been greatly reduced. For example, in the life of herdsmen, tea is very important. In the past, one sheep could only be exchanged for one pound of tea, but now, one sheep can be exchanged for more than ten pounds of tea. In the past, one sheep could only be exchanged for four or five meters of printed cloth, but now, one sheep can be exchanged for thirty or forty meters of printed cloth. The supply of salt has also been greatly improved. Herdsmen say that in the past, salt was expensive, and the sales locations were far away, and when they could not buy salt, they had to let the livestock eat some "alkaline soil," but eating alkaline soil was very easy to get sick, but now, the government has supplied a large amount of salt at a low price. The salt for humans is six million yuan per picul, but the salt for livestock is only four million yuan per picul. A herdsman said that in the past, they could only feed salt to the livestock every fifteen or sixteen days, but now, because the price of salt has dropped, they feed salt to the livestock every six or seven days.

In the past, some merchants took advantage of the fact that the honest herdsmen in the mountains did not know the market prices outside and often used some worthless small items, such as small mirrors and small combs, to deceive the herdsmen into exchanging their sheep. Now, this phenomenon no longer exists, and the trading companies and cooperatives are fully serving the herdsmen in various places. When I traveled in Nileke, I once entered a big mountain more than 170 li away from the county seat, and there was a cooperative in that big mountain, supplying various daily necessities to the local herdsmen.

My trip to Xinjiang is just the beginning, but in that short trip, I have already clearly and deeply seen: the Communist Party and Chairman Mao are how deeply loved by the people of all ethnic groups. A herdsman in the Kelamayi area, Abulahamu, said: We Kazakhs love our children the most, and when the children grow up, we will marry them off, prepare a new felt tent for them, and give them a portion of the livestock as their property, hoping that they will establish a family and prosper. He said that now the Communist Party treats us like we treat our sons, caring for and loving us without any omission. When I visited the labor model Yisha in the big mountains of Nileke, I asked him what he was thinking now? He said he had no other thoughts, and he now had only one thought, which was to follow the Communist Party and Mao Zedong and develop production well. When I was in Zhaosu, I asked a herdsman named Shaimu what he was most happy about since liberation? He thought for a moment and finally said that the thing that made him happiest was the Communist Party leading him to produce. In Kelamayi, I asked another herdsman, Ayinpek, why the Communist Party calls on everyone to develop production? He said that his family mainly thought that developing production could make their lives better. He said he also had this idea, but in addition to this, he thought that developing production was also beneficial to the country. He said that in the past, they could not eat or wear enough, but now they do not worry about eating and wearing, and it is all the result of the Communist Party's leadership, so they are especially willing to develop production well under the leadership of the Communist Party and contribute more to socialist construction.

Representatives, what I have said above is what I have seen with my own eyes and heard with my own ears during my trip. The living facts that I have personally seen have made me deeply feel that the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, as well as the people's government under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, are truly serving the people wholeheartedly. I fully agree with Premier Zhou's words: "The people for the first time saw a clean, diligent, hardworking, and people-oriented government that shares weal and woe with the people." It is precisely because of this that our Communist Party, people's government, and Chairman Mao are universally loved by the people of all ethnic groups across the country. This love makes all the people of China voluntarily and closely unite around the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, becoming an invincible force, bravely and confidently advancing towards a socialist society!

Rong Gaotang's Speech Chairman, Representatives:

I fully support Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report and will strive to further promote sports, improve people's health, and ensure the specific implementation of national defense and production tasks.

Over the past five years, with the development of various construction projects and the continuous improvement of people's material lives, under the consistent care of the Chinese Communist Party, the people's government, and Chairman Mao, sports have been regarded as an important means to enhance people's physical fitness and conduct socialist education among the working people. This has opened up an unprecedented and broad path for the development of people's sports, making our country's mass sports activities greatly developed. Currently, radio calisthenics and ball games have gradually become indispensable activities in the daily lives of millions of working people, and in schools and the army, the labor defense system has been preliminarily implemented. National defense sports such as gliding, parachuting, aviation models, sailing, and shooting have also been tried in some places. Due to the development of mass sports activities, it has shown positive effects on improving people's health, enhancing labor, work, and study efficiency. The technical level of sports has also been improved. For example, in swimming and track and field events, 35 items have broken the national records of the Kuomintang period. Our athletes have also begun to achieve some results in international sports competitions in the past two years.

Our country's sports movement is a new undertaking, and the development in the past few years is a good beginning. However, our work is still far from enough, and our sports movement is still far from meeting the needs of national economic construction and national defense construction. We must continue to actively promote mass sports activities and strive to improve people's health.

Sports are an active and effective scientific method to improve people's health. Practice has proven that where sports activities are developed, people's physical fitness will quickly improve. For example: the seventh workshop of the Machine Tool Factory in Heilongjiang Province had many sick people before the development of sports activities, and the attendance rate was only around 82%; after the entire factory started sports activities in April 1953, the physical fitness of the workers gradually improved, and since January of this year, the attendance rate has been maintained at around 97% every month, and in April, the national plan was overfulfilled by 116%. A unit in the rear service department of a certain military region had 68 people suffering from various diseases before the implementation of the labor defense system, and after the implementation of the labor defense system, after a certain period of training, physical fitness improved, and even in the hottest summer, no one fell ill. Chongqing Girls' Middle School, while implementing the preparatory level of the labor defense system, organized 31 students with mild pulmonary diseases and 43 students with weak lungs to participate in reasonable sports activities. After one semester, 17 of the students with pulmonary diseases recovered, and all the students with weak lungs improved. Therefore, sports activities are of positive significance to the construction of socialist undertakings. It can directly influence and improve our labor efficiency and enthusiasm in socialist construction, strengthen our national defense forces. Like the examples of factories, the army, and schools I mentioned above, if all factories, mines, rural areas, the army, schools, and government agencies across the country develop sports activities, they can better ensure that every worker, peasant, soldier, student, and government official can work with full energy and perseverance, and complete their tasks excellently; and at any time, they can be prepared to be brave and strong soldiers to defend the motherland from enemy invasion.

Sports activities also have important significance for the socialist ideological and moral cultivation of our people. It can cultivate the courage, perseverance, agility, optimism, organizational spirit, discipline, and collectivism of the younger generation, making everyone strong and full of vitality, becoming all-around new people for building a socialist society. It can also make the elderly maintain vigorous energy, gain health and longevity. This is not only a happiness for them but also they can use their rich knowledge and experience to participate in national construction, creating more happiness for the next generation.

Now, the people of the whole country are striving to liberate Taiwan and realize the first five-year construction plan. To consolidate national defense and develop production, we must take various effective measures to actively promote mass sports activities, making sports activities play a greater role in the great cause of building socialism.

Chen Shaomin's Speech Chairman, Representatives:

I fully agree with and support Comrade Zhou Enlai's government work report.

Over the past five years, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Central People's Government has achieved great success. The Central People's Government has led the people of the whole country to fight against domestic and foreign enemies, carried out a series of social reform movements and large-scale economic recovery work, gradually improved the material and cultural lives of the people, and on this basis of victory, started the first five-year construction plan in 1953. In our people's democratic country, the people's love for the government is boundless.

Our people's government has shown meticulous care for the working class. It has successively promulgated the "Trade Union Law of the People's Republic of China," the "Labor Insurance Regulations of the People's Republic of China," the "Provisional Regulations on the Awarding of Inventions, Technological Improvements, and Rationalization Proposals Related to Production," and other laws and regulations, and allocated a large amount of funds to improve the working conditions of workers, building workers' dormitories, hospitals, schools, nurseries, and sanatoriums, and other collective welfare undertakings. The happiness that Chinese workers could only dream of under the reactionary rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang has become a reality today. The broad masses of workers have deeply felt the superiority of the people's democratic system from their own lives; they have realized that the purpose of active production is to build socialism and meet the growing material and cultural needs of the people. Therefore, they actively learn from the Soviet experience, participate in labor competitions, innovate technology, increase production, and practice thrift to accelerate the pace of socialist construction.

The various departments of the Central People's Government have achieved great results, but there are still some phenomena of bureaucratism in some departments, such as being detached from the masses and reality. The phenomenon of waste in basic construction and industrial production is still quite serious, for example: using large materials for small purposes, treating usable raw materials as waste, and even some enterprises selling useful parts as scrap iron, and some textile mills wasting yarn, etc., have not been seriously criticized in time. Soviet textile model Kucherova criticized our textile mills for "scattering gold," which is indeed the case. For example, the state spends a large amount of money to improve the working conditions and material and cultural lives of workers, but some factories and mines have not reasonably used this investment to solve the most urgent and important problems in production and people's lives; or they have grasped the main problems but do not pay attention to quality. For example, in the measures plan of a certain factory, it is stipulated to build dormitories, build a large auditorium, buy trash cans, and buy food cabinets, but the problem of reducing the temperature in high-temperature workshops is not included in the plan; in some places, a lot of money is spent to build dormitories for workers, but as soon as they are built, they leak, which naturally causes dissatisfaction among the workers. In the implementation of the processing and contracting policy, there are also deviations, for example, in the oil pressing industry, the same raw materials, some factories have improved technology and produced more oil, but the processing fee is the same as that of the factory with less oil output; and some factories determine the processing fee according to the cost, and the higher the cost, the more the processing fee, and the lower the cost, the less the processing fee, resulting in encouraging backwardness, and the state suffers losses, and workers are not satisfied. The masses have opinions on the waste of state funds, and they have put forward many suggestions to innovate technology and practice thrift, but some factory and mine leaders have not seriously studied the opinions of the masses, relied on the masses, and improved management, so the management work cannot keep up with the needs of production development. Of course, in the absence of management experience, shortcomings in work are inevitable, but the main problem is not that there are shortcomings in work, but that these shortcomings are not taken seriously, and no active measures are taken to overcome these shortcomings, which is bureaucratism. I think that as long as the relevant departments of the people's government plan and regularly go deep into the grassroots and the masses, discover problems, summarize experiences, praise progress, criticize mistakes, and specifically help the leaders of factories and mines to rely on the masses and improve management, it is possible to correct shortcomings and greatly improve the management level.

Trade unions are the bridge between the Communist Party and the masses and the pillar of the people's government, with the responsibility to educate the broad masses of workers to actively participate in enterprise management and help enterprise administrators overcome shortcomings. However, our work in this regard is far from enough, especially in not timely criticizing the bureaucratic style, which is a major shortcoming in trade union work and must be corrected. In the future, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, with the support of the people's government, we will further strengthen the political, cultural, and technical education of the broad masses of workers, guide them to strictly abide by the constitution, abide by labor discipline, actively participate in enterprise management, deeply carry out labor competitions with technological innovation as the main content, practice thrift, increase production, and ensure the comprehensive completion of the state plan, concentrating our efforts to struggle for socialist construction and socialist transformation.

专栏：

    在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上
    代表们关于政府工作报告的发言
    李书城代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告，现在就农业生产方面提供一些情况。
    五年来，我国的农业生产，正如邓子恢副主任在发言中所说的，已经获得了迅速的恢复和发展。
      一九四九年全国刚解放的时候，农业生产水平比抗日战争以前下降了四分之一左右。一九五二年，我国的各种主要农产品，已经超过抗日战争前最高水平。全国粮食共产三千二百七十多亿斤，超过百分之九；棉花达到二千五百八十多万担，超过百分之五十二，从而根本改变了国民党统治时期指靠粮棉入口过日子的情况。
      一九五三年，我国开始进行有计划的经济建设，为着满足国民经济日益发展的需要，农业生产战线上面临着重大的任务，粮食、棉花、油料、特产、牲畜、水产等都要相应地增加生产。今年是第
  一个五年计划的第二年，广大农民和各级干部跟百年少有的洪水进行了英勇的斗争。灾区积极排水，救护禾苗，抢种晚秋；非灾区争取超额增产。今年粮、棉和油料虽不能完成计划产量，但总产量仍能超过去年。畜牧、水产可以完成计划。毛猪将超过计划。
    我国农业生产发展的事实充分证明，由于土地改革的完成和农业合作化的发展，我国农业生产力已经显著地提高了。
    我国农业经济中的社会主义因素正在增长，已经建立了机械化和半机械化的国营农场一百一十多个，省、专区、县农场二千三百多个，国营牧场八十九个，国营水产企业十九个，机器拖拉机站一百零
  一个，农业生产合作社十万多个，另外还有六千多万农户组织在农业生产互助组中。这些程度不同的先进的经济成份的日益增长，以及它们在农民群众中的示范带头作用，为今后农业的社会主义改造和生产的迅速发展提供了有利的条件。
    五年来，国家发放了大批的农业贷款；以大量资金兴建了水利工程，生产和供应了近百万件新式畜力农具，上千万吨商品肥料；贯彻了奖励增产的税收政策和价格政策。这都是帮助广大农民扩大再生产的物质保证。
    同时，在广大农民群众的爱国增产运动中，涌现出无数的劳动模范和生产能手，其中有五百五十三个单位和人物获得中央农业部的奖励，还有成千上万的优秀人物受到地方政府的表扬。出席这次大会的李顺达同志等五十七位农业劳动模范，就是他们之中最杰出的代表人物。
    全国已有农业科学研究、试验和技术推广的机构八千三百多个单位，从业人员十多万人。这支农业技术队伍，本着科学研究为农业增产服务的方针，使外来的科学技术知识同当地群众的先进经验结合起来，依托互助合作组织，广泛地开展了群众性的技术改进工作，如深耕保墒、适当密植、合理灌溉、增施肥料、推广良种、改良土壤、繁殖牲畜、改进农具等。在防治病虫害方面，药械的运用已很普遍，尤其值得提出的，从一九五一年起，每年都有飞机出动防治蝗虫。我们对蝗虫已经有把握给以控制。
    各级干部在农业生产中做了很多工作，但我们农业部门在工作中也还有着主观主义的缺点，造成了不少错误。由于对中国农村经济的特点和各地不同的生产条件注意不够，许多为农民所需要的工作，如推广新式农具、优良品种、农药机械、化学肥料等，在不少地区因一般化的工作方法，曾发生过强迫命令、形式主义，引起群众不满。对领导国营农业企业，由于缺乏经验和铺张思想，曾造成成本高、产量低、浪费大的现象，从而减弱了国营农业企业应有的示范作用。现在这些缺点已经大力纠正，但仍需戒骄戒躁，进一步去克服和纠正。
    我国农业虽然有很大进展，但小农经济还占优势，生产设备还很落后，农产品还不够充裕，按全国六亿人口平均，每人每年只有五百多斤粮食，四斤左右的棉花，肉类和油脂等副食品也还不多，目前已经呈现出供不应求的状况。因此，在发展工业的同时，必须相应地按比例地发展农业，大力增产粮食，增产棉花、油料及特产，努力发展畜牧业和水产业。
    为了完成艰巨的农业增产任务，就必须在农村中开展以互助合作为中心的群众性的农业增产运动，各级政府农业部门必须从经济、技术、生产经营和人才训练等方面对农业生产合作社和互助组积极给予帮助。同时还要继续发展和改进国营农业企业，为国家增产更多的农畜产品，积累资金，培养干部，向农民进行示范，逐渐扩大社会主义的农业基地。
    保证农业增产的具体办法是扩大耕地面积和提高单位面积产量。扩大耕地面积是解决粮食问题的必经之路，根据我国情况，主要是在尚未开发的地区进行大规模的垦殖，农业部门已经开始组织勘查，预计在第一个五年计划内可以完成一亿亩可耕荒地的勘测设计任务。
    提高现有耕地面积的单位面积产量是目前农业增产的主要出路。我国自然条件优厚，有着几千年经营农业的经验，再加上苏联在技术上的援助，只要善于运用这些有利条件，我们是能够迅速发展农业生产的。目前我们还不可能大量用拖拉机，主要是靠畜力和新式农具进行耕作，必须有计划地推广双轮双铧犁和其他新式的畜力农具；有计划地繁殖牲畜；发动群众多积肥料，增加化学肥料的供应；组织群众选留良种，逐步扩大良种面积；加强农业科学研究和推广工作，增设农业技术推广站，逐步做到每个区都有一个。随着农业合作化的发展和各种增产措施的贯彻，农业技术改革，将会更广泛更深入地开展起来，使农业生产取得进一步的发展。
    过去反动统治及长期的落后生产方法给农业生产遗留下无数的灾难，我们今天还不能一下子克服，每年还有成千万亩的田地遭受水、旱、病、虫等自然灾害。因此，农业部门除了加强植物保护工作以外，还要以更大的力量协同水利部门继续组织群众因地制宜地兴修农田水利，以有效地防害兴利，减少受灾面积，扩大受益面积。对灾区农民给予必要的经济支援和技术指导，尽快地恢复生产。
    为了加强对农业生产的领导，必须办好农业院校，培养干部，农业部门的干部必须努力学习理论和政策，学习苏联农业科学，总结和提高我国农民群众的生产经验，深入基层，联系群众，改进工作作风。
    中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议为我国社会主义建设事业指明了前进方向。
  一切农业工作者，应该以自己的实际工作来热烈地拥护自己的宪法，以无限的忠诚献身于农业的社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业。
    达理札雅代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意并拥护周总理的报告。
    五年来，我们甘肃蒙族人民，在中国共产党和毛主席的伟大民族政策的光辉照耀下，民族关系发生了根本的变化。历代封建统治阶级所造成的互不信任、互相歧视的旧的关系正在逐日消失，而团结互助、友爱合作的新的关系正在不断成长并日趋巩固。甘肃蒙古自治区的成立，就是这种新的民族关系成长发展的结果。五年来，随着民族关系的深刻变化，在政治、经济、文化各方面，都获得了显著的发展和提高，无论在农业区或牧业区，城市或乡村，都已确实地改变了旧日的面貌。甘肃蒙古自治区在畜牧业生产方面，经过防疫保畜等工作，几年来牲畜数量有很大增加。据一九五三年统计，骆驼增加了百分之一百三十八，羊增加了百分之二百一十四。在磴口县农业地区，经过土地改革，农村的互助合作运动已有开展，现在组织起来的农户，已占到总农户数的百分之七十三，提高了劳动生产力。教育方面，解放前广大草原地区没有一所小学，现在设立了九所；而在巴音浩特市区，学生人数增加了百分之一百七十八。随着社会经济的向前发展，人民的物质生活和文化生活有了初步的改善。各族人民特别是蒙族人民已从自己的实际生活中深刻体验到一个简单的真理：跟着共产党走就是幸福。
    我们的工作虽然取得了一定的成绩，但是还存在着不少的缺点，主要的是：我们的政策水平低，工作经验不足，不能很好地根据政策结合实际做好工作。对农牧业生产的领导不够深入，总结推广群众的先进生产经验做的还很差。对“牧工、牧主两利”政策的宣传和贯彻还不够，所有这些缺点，必须引为深刻的教训。今后为使我们的工作由胜利走向更大的胜利，必须继续贯彻慎重稳进的方针，加强民族团结，提高革命警惕，防止敌特分子利用各种方法进行破坏团结和建设事业的活动，大力发展农牧业生产，为达到生产茂盛、人口兴旺而努力。
    让我们同全国各族人民一道更加紧密地团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，为解放台湾，为实施宪法，建成繁荣幸福的社会主义祖国而奋斗。
    胡子昂代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我听了周总理的报告，深切地感到解放五年来我们国家在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下各方面都取得了辉煌的成就，我完全同意并拥护这个报告。我参加工商界的工作，愿就资本主义工商业的社会主义改造问题提供两点意见：
      一、去年我听到周总理的讲话，说资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，是一个相当长时期的艰巨工作。我当时对这个问题的认识是不够的。我以为我们工作的地区较小，情况简单，工商界又经过了“五反”运动的教育，并且不少资本家已经表示要争取走上国家资本主义的道路，因此，我的思想就麻痹起来，忽略了对资本主义工商业进行改造的过程是有团结有斗争的。经过总路线的学习，最近我们对重庆工商界的违法事件作了一次排队的工作，我才真正感到资本主义工商业的改造的长期性与艰巨性。就重庆市今年第一、二季度对私营工商业户纳税进行民主评议的结果来看，在五十二个行业中，补报税款的面到了百分之八十五，补报深度平均是百分之四点五，补报金额最高的一家达到三亿七千余万元。虽然当中有一部分是由于理解不够，是无心的，但已足以说明偷漏税情况的严重。有些资本家平时在小组会上一般还表现积极，但当有人批评资本家或资产阶级的时候，就很容易打动他的阶级感情，并且觉得“骂在脸上痛在心里”；当他碰到利害关头的时候，又立刻显露出唯利是图的腐朽本质，忘却了爱国守法的义务。重庆就有资本家一方面挪欠税款，一方面大吃大喝，并为他的妻子买了两千多万元的手表，为儿子兑去一千三百万元说交学校膳食费，难道这还不是浪费资金、抽逃资金吗？经过批评教育，他自己才承认错误。这说明了资本主义工商业的企业改造必须结合资本家个人的思想改造，如果不从思想上挖出根源，加以批判，那么一有机会，便会旧病复发。因此，我以为只有依照国家计划有步骤地、广泛而深入地对资本家进行积极经营、爱国守法的思想教育，才能使他们在思想上得到改造，才可能在行动上愉快地接受社会主义改造。
    二、进行资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，还必须加强工商行政机关的管理和国营经济单位的领导，当然也要组织工人群众的监督。据我的了解：现在有些单位的干部，还多忙于自己的业务工作，而对资本主义工商业的改造，缺乏积极主动的态度；如对批发商的转业有时停留在反复了解、迟缓不决的阶段，对加工订货检查规格的尺度，还有时偏高偏低，把握不稳，因之带来了改造工作中不应有的困难。我建议有关部门在今后工作中，还须进
  一步提高干部的政策水平、业务水平，加强对资本主义工商业的领导管理，鼓励并教育、指导广大的私营工商业者早日走上国家资本主义的道路。同时，在改造资本主义工商业的进程中，对于资本家在企业管理和操作技术上确有专长的，最好通过有关单位把他们组织起来加强学习，奖励他们努力钻研科学技术，公开技术秘密，许多资方老工程人员如有新的发明，可由国家给予适当的名誉奖励或物质奖励，以充分发挥其有利于国计民生的作用。要求工作干部坚定信心，必须确认资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，是一件长期性、艰苦性的工作；但有以工人阶级为领导的政权的领导，若干进步的私营工商业者又不断努力和争取改造，大势所趋，人心所向，这一工作是肯定可以逐步地作好的。
    最后为了保证宪法的实施，为了支援台湾的解放，愿同全体代表、全国人民一道为实现周恩来总理的报告中所提出的各项任务而奋斗。
    覃应机代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我们完全同意周总理的政府工作报告。
    解放后，广西省在中国共产党和人民政府的正确领导下，贯彻了民族政策，推行了民族区域自治。特别是在建立桂西僮族自治区以后，僮族和其他各少数民族人民都得到了当家作主的权利和民族平等的地位，各民族间出现了互助、团结友爱的新现象，大大提高了政治积极性和生产热忱，胜利地开展了自治区的各项建设工作。在各民族人民的共同要求以及同人民有联系的各族领袖人物的赞同下，先后完成了全区土地改革，解放了农村生产力，农民的生产积极性空前高涨，促使了农业、畜牧业、林业的更大发展。一九五三年全区粮食产量已超过解放前百分之三十，一九五一年尚缺粮食五百多万斤，而一九五三年则有四亿四千二百多万斤的余粮向外调出。为了适应发展生产的需要，我们特别注意开展了自治区内的贸易工作，供应各族人民的生产资料和生活资料。占人民收入三分之一的各种土产和特产，过去有许多是滞销或销路不好的，现在已完全解决了，因而人民收入大为增加。同时得到人民政府各方面的大力扶助，各族人民的生活已逐步得到提高。过去许多是以山薯、野菜来充饥的，现在大都已能吃到干饭，穿上新衣，添置耕牛农具。文教卫生情况也有所改善。现在全区中学和小学生共一百一十多万人，比解放前增加四倍以上。过去没有医院和卫生所，现在已有医院五个，区卫生所一百九十八个，并整顿和扩建了各县卫生院，训练了防疫、防疟人员及农村接生员九千二百多人，历史性的疟疾、天花等传染病已基本上制止了。
    各族人民经过国家在过渡时期总任务的教育，提高了社会主义觉悟。目前全区参加农业互助合作组织的农户已达农户总数百分之五十五点八，林业生产合作社也正在重点建立。全区八百多万人民正以更大的努力，积极开展以互助合作为中心的爱国增产运动，争取今年完成比一九五三年增产粮食百分之十八的光荣任务。
    在这一系列的工作中间，我们对民族干部采取了积极培养、大胆大量提拔的方针，除乡一级政权干部全部是本民族的干部外，还培养了区以上僮族及其他少数民族干部二万多人。这些民族干部在外来汉族干部热忱的帮助下进步和成长是很快的。
    我们工作中虽然取得了很大的成绩，但是由于过去反动阶级长期统治的结果，各族人民生产和文化水平目前还是处于相当落后的情况，特别是山区人民的困难更多，这是需要我们今后逐步去解决的。同时，工作中的缺点也是很多的，主要的是：对自治区内各个不同民族地区的特点分析研究不够，工作中仍存在着一般化的毛病；对土产、特产及各种经济作物的生产偏于一般号召，缺乏具体组织领导；对自治机关民族化也还作得不够；自治区
  一级的财政问题尚未得到很好的解决。我们相信，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的领导下，
  一定能够克服这些缺点，并满怀信心地同各兄弟民族一道，为建设繁荣幸福的社会主义祖国而奋斗。
    杨秀峰代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意周恩来总理的政府工作报告，并建议会议通过这个报告，作为今后国家建设和外交的基本方针。
    郭沫若代表、马叙伦代表和其他几位代表的发言中，都讲到当前教育工作质量低，今后应大力提高教学质量，我很同意。作为一个教育工作者，应该根据这些意见，加强工作，改正缺点。就高等教育来说，为了达到提高质量的要求，必须努力解决
  一系列的问题。我现在只提出其中的一个，就是目前高等学校教师参加校内外社会政治活动时间过多和有些教师兼职过多的问题。因为它关联到各个方面，不是单靠教育行政措施所能很好解决的，所以我感觉到有必要在这里反映一下，希望能得到各位代表们的重视。
    建国以来，全国高等学校教师通过参加各种社会政治运动，通过兼任校外一些职务，对国家建设，对教学联系实际，对教师们思想的提高，都起了积极的作用。但据我了解，目前教师们校内外社会政治活动所用时间和兼任校内外职务都有过多的现象。
    当前高等学校教师，除少数人外，一般每周任课时间约在四至六小时，并不算多，但大家都觉得很忙。其原因，除了在学习苏联进行教学改革当中，备课、学俄文、编译教材、改进教学方法等要比过去花费较多的时间和精力外，参加校内外各种非教学的活动和会议占去时间过多，是一个重要原因。根据部分学校最近一年的材料，一般教师参加社会活动的时间平均占其全年工作总时数的百分之十三左右，少数教师达百分之三十，个别的还更多。他们并不是以为参加这些社会政治活动是不必要的和不应当的，而是认为有时突击运动连续不断，照顾教学工作不够；有时缺乏统一安排，共产党、青年团、各民主党派、工会等组织往往分头布置，校内校外，重复交叉，学校领导上很难掌握。并且多没有很好考虑学校的特点，对高等学校布置工作和对一般机关、市民一样，采取同样方式，提出同等要求，例如有些城市学习婚姻法在高等学校也要学两个月。这些情况都不必要地花费了教师们过多的时间。
    使得教师们过分忙的另一个原因是部分教师在教学任务外的兼职多。不少身兼十职以上，个别有至二十五职的。因为兼职多，就要常常出外参加工作，参加会议，再加上还时常被约请做报告、写文章、广播演讲以及送往迎来等等活动，因而非常忙碌。
    参加社会活动过多及兼职过多的教师，差不多又都是学校行政上或是教学研究上的领导骨干人员，他们的额外任务太重，必然要程度不同地影响自己岗位上的工作和教学研究工作，以至影响身体健康。因此，不少教师在思想上有矛盾，有苦闷。从提高教学和研究工作上看，也是迫切需要解决的。
    如何解决这些问题呢？
    我认为，首先必须肯定：高等学校教师应当而且必须积极地自觉地参加一定的社会政治活动和校外某些工作，这对国家建设和教师在实践当中不断提高自己思想政治水平和业务水平都是必要的。只顾埋头钻研业务，不关心政治，不关心国家建设事业，显然是不对的。这是一方面。
    另一方面，由于高等学校教师的基本任务是进行教学工作和科学研究工作。因此，一切校内外其他活动，就应在有利于完成这个基本任务或尽量少妨碍完成这个基本任务的前提下来组织进行。为了迅速而有效地提高教学质量，就必须使教师们的精力和时间尽可能地集中于教学和科学研究工作，以充分发挥其专长，培养新生力量。像上面所说那些不必要的占用教师精力和时间的情况，急需有计划有步骤地加以改进。至于如何在保证教学质量和逐步开展科学研究的前提下，照顾到各种情况，合理安排校内外各项社会政治活动和恰当解决教师兼职过多的问题，除主要由主管机关和学校加以筹划外，因为牵涉方面很多，更必须有各方面协力，才可能逐步作到。为此，特向大会反映，请大家指正。
    张德生代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意和衷心拥护周恩来总理所作的政府工作报告。
    五年来，我们国家在各个方面的成就确实是伟大的。广大人民之所以欢欣鼓舞，也正是因为我们的国家的确是在飞跃地前进着。当然，这并不是说，我们工作中没有缺点了。拿甘肃的工作来说，五年来人民政府为人民办了很多好事，但是，因为我们过去对中央的正确指示领会不深，对地方的实际情况了解不够，对干部的教育工作抓得不紧，各部门间的相互配合也不够紧密，曾经发生过许多缺点和错误。以领导农业生产为例，在土地改革完成之后，特别是在宣传了国家过渡时期总任务之后，不少农民积极要求组织起来，而领导上对这种新的情况却估计不足，今年全省已经组织起来的农业生产合作社便超过了原计划的三倍以上。甘肃部分地区历年遭受旱灾，我们以往偏重于救济，对于兴修水利、植树造林、水土保持等工作在甘肃具有特别重要的意义认识不足，因而没有采取更多的具体措施，从根本上来逐步解决甘肃的干旱问题。甘肃全省各地区之间，自然条件、经济状况和耕作习惯等等各不相同，而有些干部却往往对此不加区别，一样对待。基层干部一般是好的，但由于我们过去多半坐在机关，忙于处理公文、电报以及日常事务，到下边去亲眼看的较少，对下边干部的具体帮助也不够，尤其是对他们缺乏经常的有系统的教育，这就难免使得有些干部虽然经常住在农村，但对农村新的情况熟视无睹；有些干部不善于同人民群众商量办事，表现简单、生硬、一般化，影响了某些工作不能收到应有的效果，甚至有时把好事办坏了。像这些主观、片面、脱离实际、脱离群众的缺点和错误，不仅在领导农业生产工作中发生过，就是在其他工作中，也程度不同地发生过。其中有些缺点和错误是同中央有关业务部门分不开的。值得我们今后经常地注意防止和克服。我相信：随着人民民主制度的日益健全和干部领导水平的不断提高，这些缺点和错误一定能够逐渐减少以至克服，在克服这些缺点和错误的过程中，将使我们的工作不断地得到改进，并且一定会得到广大人民进一步的支持，从而，我们的社会主义事业也一定能够获得进一步的发展。
    黄欧东代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    全国人民代表大会会议的召开，是我国人民政治生活中的极大喜事，是我国人民民主制度进一步的发展，是有关我国向社会主义社会过渡时期的国家建设的根本问题。这次大会将对中国的历史进程发生巨大的作用和长远的影响。我以非常兴奋的心情，祝贺会议的成功。
    周恩来总理代表中央人民政府所做的政府工作报告，一方面说明了从中华人民共和国成立以来，我们国家根据中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领所规定的原则，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下进行了巨大的工作，因而在政治、经济、文化和国防建设以及外交和国际活动各方面都取得了伟大的成就，为我国逐步过渡到社会主义社会铺平了道路，准备了必要的条件。另一方面指出我们国家几年来在胜利的斗争中，工作上仍存在有缺点，同时根据我国在过渡时期的总任务和我们工作的现实情况，提出了今后我国政府工作的方针和任务。拿辽宁地区局部的情况来看如同全国的情况一样，证明这个报告是正确的，我完全同意并衷心拥护。
    辽宁地区包括原来的辽东、辽西两省，沈阳、旅大、鞍山、抚顺、本溪五个市。几年来在中央的正确领导下，依靠全体人民积极努力和苏联无私的援助，这个地区各方面的工作都获得了一定的成就。特别是几年来由于中央以这个地区为工业建设的重点，组织了全国的力量加以支援，因此工业建设的成就较为大一些。国营工业的生产指标和基本建设的规模是逐年增加的，建设了许多规模巨大、技术复杂、设备近代化的企业，许多主要重工业如冶炼、燃料、机械、电器等产品，占东北地区比重很大，各种新产品制造的任务也越来越多。几年来依靠全体职工增产节约、劳动竞赛、推广先进经验、贯彻苏联专家建议，不断地提高了劳动热忱和技术水平，胜利地完成和超额完成了生产建设任务。
    辽宁地区是社会主义工业比较集中的地区，工矿城市多，重工业多，重点工程多，农业特产多，为实现国家的社会主义工业化负有很重要的任务。但是几年来辽宁地区的各项工作仍是不能令人满意的，工作上是有很多缺点和错误。例如：在工业建设方面，某些领导干部依靠工人阶级的思想和完成国家计划的观念是不深刻的，某些工矿企业生产计划保守，基本建设贪多冒进的现象仍是存在的；企业管理水平不高，政治工作不强，政治空气稀薄，在政治工作和经济工作结合方面存在不少问题，尚未摸出成熟的经验；对学习苏联的重要意义也认识得不深刻，因而学习苏联的主动性和系统性不够；技术力量的培养还远远赶不上生产的需要，许多新产品不能按期完成试制任务；提高产品质量、降低成本、保证安全生产都未达到应有的要求，使生产计划完成不均衡、不全面。在农村，主要对区乡干部的培养训练工作做得不够，农村工作质量不高，如互助合作和推广新式农具的工作中，在不同时期和不同程度上存在有贪多冒进和放任自流的偏向。在地方各级人民政府中，还有某些忽视政治思想领导的现象，机关工作人员的思想改造工作还不够彻底，贯彻人民民主制度和民主集中制还不够认真，官僚主义的作风还存在不少。在其他各方面工作上也都是有很多缺点的。
    产生这些缺点和错误的原因，主要是由于某些领导干部还或多或少地有个人主义和主观主义，片面地虚夸工作的成就，来显示个人的作用和个人的威信，滋长着极端危险的骄傲自满情绪，不愿意正视工作中的缺点和错误，不虚心学习其他地区的经验，不认真地研究中央的政策和指示，不经常地深入下面检查工作，对下面缺乏具体领导和实际帮助，这就不可能及时地纠正和克服工作中的缺点和错误，使工作上受了不少损失。
    现在辽宁地区已遵照中央人民政府的决定合并为辽宁省，我们深深感到自己所负担的任务是十分艰巨的，今后我们只有更紧密地团结在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的周围，贯彻执行中央的政策、法令和指示，加强学习，提高自己，充分发扬批评和自我批评精神，接受群众的监督，接受过去的经验教训，克服骄傲自满情绪，兢兢业业，努力工作，为实现祖国社会主义工业化而奋斗。
    谢觉哉代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意周总理的政府工作报告。现在我仅就救济工作和优抚工作发表点意见。
    帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治，是人民灾难的制造者，灾荒和贫穷吞噬着人民。中华人民共和国成立后，我国人民在中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，即向这些灾难作斗争。我们把防灾、救灾和对于贫困人民的救济，当作政治任务，当作维护人民生产的工作，而不是像旧时代反动统治者的所谓“慈善”。
    由于反动统治阶级长期地对于农林、水利的破坏，新的水利、造林等建设还来不及起很大的和普遍的防灾作用。几年以来，每年都有相当大的自然灾害：一九四九年全国受灾面积有一亿二千万亩，
  一九五○年有七千六百万亩，一九五一年有五千六百万亩，一九五二年有六千六百万亩，一九五三年有九千四百万亩，一九五四年由于江淮流域雨量特大，被淹的农田约一亿六千多万亩。我们的对策是：当灾害到来时，人民政府即组织成千万人民的力量，采用多种多样的办法，进行防旱、防霜、捕虫、防汛的巨大战斗，因而得到了许多被灾田亩不成灾或减轻灾的成果；而当灾害已成，则实行生产自救、节约度荒、群众互助，并由政府予以必要的救济。五年以来国家拨作救灾用的款项：一九五○年为八千六百八十七亿元，一九五一年为六千四百二十三亿元，一九五二年为一万零一百二十六亿元，一九五三年为一万五千一百三十四亿元，一九五四年截至目前止为三万亿元，如连现在尚需追加的预算还不止此数。以上连同城市和其他方面的救济，共约十一万多亿元。我们的救济，主要在维持农民的劳动力使之能继续从事于副业生产和恢复农业生产，不使之有饥饿和逃亡的现象发生。虽然在救灾工作中，不少地区还存在着发动人民组织生产不够，对救济粮款平均发放，或者救不及时、当救未救等缺点；但一般地说，受灾地区都能安然度过灾荒，保护了劳动能力，恢复了生产。
    今年长江、淮河的洪水是近百年来少有的，我们防洪的成绩是历史上没有的。中央人民政府和各省区人民政府对于防洪的物资供应和技术的支持，都做到了要什么给什么，要怎样快就怎样快。而当地的干部、驻军和人民以无比的英勇和积极性，满怀信心同洪水决斗。比如今年武昌杨泗矶堤防发生险情时，参加抢险的人民解放军战士，立即跳进水中，结成一道“人墙”，挡住了风浪，保全了堤身。荆江大堤在江陵县发生漏洞时，该县副县长李大汉同志立即率领数人，跳入洪水，以身体堵住了洞口，挽救了险象。这样的事实到处都有。更主要的还在于人民以极高的互助合作精神，作了深入和广泛的组织工作。比如武汉市昼夜不休地同洪水搏斗两个多月，而防洪队伍的部署和人民生产生活的布置，一点不乱，供给一点不缺，城市秩序照常稳定。
    湖北、湖南、安徽等省遭水地区有近千万灾民需要向邻近的或较远的地区转移。在转移中，组织严密，计划周详。“灾民到那里，干部到那里”；
  “负责带出去，负责带回来”。按照行政单位，以互助合作组织为核心，有计划、有准备地集体行动。沿途的粮食、茶水、医药都设供应站。灾民自带的衣服、粮食、锅碗，完全无失。到达地点，当地群众热情接待，腾房借地，安置得有条有理。关于粮食物资的供应，设有专用船只送到灾民门上。这样广大的有效的组织力量，是旧时代所不能想像的。而没有把广大人民群众这样有计划的组织起来，也不可能想像长期同洪水的搏斗能够得到胜利，不可能想像成千百万的灾民仓卒转移，能够不受损失。在转移工作中仅仅有个别地区，由于准备差，作的不够好。
    我们遭受近百年来最大的一次洪水，但是所受损失却减到了最低限度。洪水虽然远远超过了一九三一年水位，但在一九三一年死亡人民达三百七十万，而今年死于水患的人民则屈指可数。
    自然，在今年的水灾中，农产物、房屋、农具、牲畜的损失，堤防的毁坏，是很严重的。除国家需要拨发很大数量的救济粮款，调配大量的物资外，还须进行巨大的组织工作，即组织人民进行副业生产，修复堤坝、房屋、补充农具、牲畜，医治疾病。这不是有钱就够了，而是要有许多办法；不只是作出指示或命令就够了，而是要工作人员同人民群众结合，实际去做。灾区各地，应以生产救灾为中心，各部门、各方面必须密切配合，协同动作，通过各级人民代表大会，依靠互助合作力量，有计划、有步骤地进行修复工作，大力开展生产工作、节约度荒和社会互助运动。我们完全有条件战胜灾荒。但是，必须认识困难很多，要一点不松懈地全力以赴，才能够做得好。
    对于城市救济，我们也做了很多工作。娼妓、乞丐、烟毒等历史上遗留下的肮脏，基本上已不存在。游民也大大减少。各城市收容改造的游民，大都是改造好出去的多，而收进来的少。城市的秩序出现了新面貌。这主要由于生产发展，就业的机会多，人民觉悟提高，不甘堕落，而一些无劳力的残废老弱都已由政府收容和救济所致。
    共同纲领上规定：“革命烈士和革命军人的家属，其生活困难者应受国家和社会的优待。参加革命战争的残废军人和退伍军人，应由人民政府给以适当安置，使能谋生立业。”各级人民政府对于这一工作作了许多努力。在各项社会改革运动中，特别是在抗美援朝运动中，广大人民群众的爱国主义的觉悟日益提高，拥军优属工作，已成为广泛的群众性的自觉的活动。对于缺乏劳动力的革命烈士家属、革命军人家属，为其代耕土地和予以实物补助；对于有劳动力和半劳动力的革命烈士家属、革命军人家属，帮助其组织生产；对于革命残废军人，予以抚恤和帮助其安家立业，对于复员建设军人，帮助其解决生活困难和介绍职业，大都实现了优抚条例上的要求，得到了很大成绩。
    这里值得指出的是，互助合作运动的蓬勃发展，给革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人带来了幸福和方便。目前参加互助合作组织的人数有很大增长。根据二十一个省部分县的统计，革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人、复员建设军人参加互助合作组织的占其总户数的百分之六十以上，有的地区达到百分之七十以上。结合互助合作这一优越形式，在优抚工作上如代耕土地、安置就业等方面，有了很大的便利。同时，由于他们的参加，也相应地发展了和巩固了互助合作组织。
    由于革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人同人民革命事业有血肉相联的关系，他们一般是觉悟程度较高，政治品质良好，在参加社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业中，大都表现积极，有好多已经成为人民群众所敬爱的劳动英雄和模范人物。比如，河北省回乡军人中有将近百分之六十的人当了乡、村干部，有一千三百多人当选为劳动模范。广西、辽宁等省七个县的部分统计，有三百三十多名革命烈士家属、革命军人家属当选为互助组长，有四十五人当选为农业生产合作社主任，有一百八十多人当选为县、乡人民代表大会的代表。全国各地还有不少人当选为省、市和全国人民代表大会的代表。在六十七所革命残废军人学校中，有五万多名学员在学习，有一万多名毕业学生走上了各种建设事业岗位。而这些已在工作的人，大都是热情、努力、遵守纪律，得到人民和各级领导机关的称许。
    因此，各级国家机关工作人员和人民群众，不仅要认识到：革命烈士家属，革命军人家属、革命残废军人、复员建设军人在革命事业中贡献了他们的亲人，贡献了自己的力量，应当受到国家和人民的尊重和优待；而且还要认识到他们在前方是人民和国家的保卫者，在后方是社会建设的积极因素。我们应当认识到优抚工作是为了建设和巩固现代化国防、反对帝国主义侵略的重要工作之一，同时也是建设繁荣幸福的社会主义社会的重要工作之一。
    优抚工作虽然有上述成就，但还有不少缺点。现在还有些地方，对于发动和组织他们参加生产，没有高度重视；有些地方，积压优抚款项，未能认真地解决革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人生产上和生活上的困难；有些地方平均发放优抚款项，或该发不发，不该发的又发了，没有发挥物质补助和扶植生产的积极作用；有些地方，对于有困难的复员建设军人未能负责到底地给以安置；有些地方，对他们之中有些人不愿意积极从事劳动生产而专依赖优待的思想，未能及时有效地教育纠正。这些缺点，虽然是少数，但也不是很少数。这些缺点是同我们领导机关的官僚主义作风分不开的。今后需要用很大的力量予以克服。
    储安平代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意并拥护周总理的政府工作报告。
    在大会开幕前的半个多月，我正在新疆伊犁旅行。在旅行中，我深切地体会到：中国共产党和人民政府是真正为人民办事的，周总理在报告中所说的“我们的一切工作都是为了人民的”这句话完全是真实的。我所旅行的伊犁东部几个县，是主要从事畜牧业生产的地区。我每到一个地方，都访问了一些牧民。他们都告诉我：这几年来牲畜都有了发展，生活逐年上升，共产党和人民政府经常关心着他们，并且给他们以各种具体的帮助。他们说，在过去国民党反动派时代，过冬是一个关，过一个冬天牲畜总要死亡很多。但是现在，秋天还没有到，政府就在教导牧民要养好秋膘，使羊子容易安全过冬；冬天还没有到，政府又在号召牧民抓紧割草，以免牲畜冬天没有草吃。今年春天，有些牧民过冬的草料已经用完，情况非常困难，政府又及时地发放了购草的贷款，并且动员草多的牧民把多余的草卖给缺草的牧民。在共产党和人民政府这样的关切帮助下，牧民在冬天所遇到的困难，已经比从前小得多了。狼对牲畜也是一个大害。但是这几年来，政府领导牧民组织打狼组，供给牧民打狼的猎枪、子弹和狼夹子。一般说来，各地的狼害都不同程度地减轻了，人和牲畜都得到了保护。过去在牲畜中常常发生疾病，其中有些都是很厉害的传染病，一经发生，便会引起成群的死亡。这几年来，由于政府经常派兽医带了药品到各牧区去进行预防和治疗，所以牲畜中的疾病已经大大减少了，近年来没有发生过什么传染病。过去羊身上容易长癣，现在有政府低价供应牧民药水，羊身上就不再长癣了。
    共产党和人民政府还在很多方面教导并帮助牧民发展生产。例如经常向牧民宣传改良品种；关于这一点，已经在牧民中引起了普遍而深刻的反应。很多牧民都向我提到改良品种的好处。他们说：一公斤土种的哈萨羊的羊毛只能卖一万几千元，但一公斤改良种的新疆羊的羊毛可以卖到四万多元；而且新疆羊的毛又要比哈萨羊的毛多三、四倍。新疆羊的奶和肉也都要比哈萨羊的奶和肉多。政府不仅向牧民宣传改良品种的好处，而且还常常把种羊贷给牧民，两三年以后再还清。好几个牧民都说，他们贷到的种羊，这两年来，不要说生下的小羊羔已经抵得上种羊的贷款，就是所长的羊毛也已经抵得上种羊的贷款了。
    牧民的生活这几年来是普遍地提高了，同过去国民党反动派统治时期，简直不能比了。一方面，过去畜产品不值钱，现在国家收购，畜产品的价格比从前提高了很多。就说肠衣吧，过去没有人要，完全不值钱，可是现在贸易公司收购，牧民卖掉了一根肠衣，就可以换回二十匣火柴；另一方面，日用消费品的价格都大大降低了。例如在牧民生活中很重要的茶，过去一只羊只能换到一磅茶，而现在，一只羊可以换到十磅多茶叶了。过去一只羊只能换到四、五米花洋布，现在一只羊可以换到三、四十米花洋布了。盐的供应也大大改善。牧民说，过去盐很贵，销售的地点又远，他们买不到盐时，只能让牲口吃一些“碱土”，但是吃了碱土很容易生病，而现在，政府大量并低价供应了食盐。人吃的盐，一普特六万元，但是牲畜吃的盐，一普特只要四万元。一个牧民说，他们过去要隔十五、六天才给牲口喂一次盐，现在因为盐价低了，所以每隔六、七天就给牲口喂一次盐了。
    过去有些私商，欺侮终年在山区里不知道外面的市价的老实的牧民，常常用一些不值钱的小东西，如小镜子、小梳子等，到山区里骗取牧民的羊子。现在，这种现象已经没有了，贸易公司和合作社都充分地在为各地的牧民服务。我在尼勒克旅行时，曾经进入离开县城有一百七十多华里的大山里，在那个大山里，就有合作社，供应当地牧民以各种日用消费品。
    我在新疆的旅行还只是一个开始，然而在那短短的旅行中，我已经亲切而深刻的看到：共产党和毛主席是如何地受着各族人民的衷心的热爱。巩留木合区的牧民阿布勒哈木生说：我们哈萨克人是最爱自己的孩子的，孩子长大了，就要给他成亲，给他预备一个新的毡帐棚，在牲口里分出一部分牲口给他，作为他的财产，希望他好好地成家立业，发家致富。他说，现在共产党待我们，就像我们待我们的儿子一样，关心爱护，无微不至。我在尼勒克的大山里访问当地的劳动模范依沙的时候，我问他现在有什么想头？他说他没有别的想头，他现在只有一个念头，就是跟着共产党和毛泽东父亲走，好好发展生产。我在昭苏的时候，问一个牧民叫沙衣母的，问他解放以来他觉得什么事情最高兴？他想了一下，最后说，使他最高兴的事情是共产党领导他生产。在巩留木合，我问另一个牧民阿音培克，问他共产党为什么要号召大家发展生产？他说，他家里的人主要认为发展生产可以使自己的生活过好。他说他自己也有这样的想法，但是除了这点，他认为发展生产对于国家也是有利的。他说他们过去吃不好，穿不好，现在吃穿不愁，都是共产党领导的结果，所以格外愿意在共产党的领导下，好好发展生产，在社会主义建设中多尽一分力量。
    各位代表，以上我所说的，就是我在旅行中亲眼看到的，亲耳听到的。我亲身所看到的这些活生生的事实，使我深深地体会到，共产党和毛主席，以及在共产党和毛主席领导下的人民政府，是真正全心全意为人民服务的。我完全同意周总理的话：“人民群众第一次看到了廉洁的、认真办事的、艰苦奋斗的、联系群众的、与群众共甘苦共患难的自己的政府。”也正因为这样，我们的共产党、人民政府和毛主席，就普遍地受到全国各地各族人民的无限的热烈的爱。这种爱，使全中国的人民自愿地紧密地团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，成为一股巨大的不可战胜的力量，英勇地并满怀信心地向着社会主义社会前进！
    荣高棠代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告，并努力进一步地开展体育运动，增进人民健康，以利于保证国防和生产任务的具体实现。
    五年以来，由于各项建设事业的日益发展和人民物质生活的不断改善，由于中国共产党、人民政府和毛主席一贯地关怀，把体育运动作为增强人民体质和向劳动人民进行社会主义教育的重要手段，这就给人民体育事业开辟了空前良好和广阔的道路，使我国群众性的体育运动有了很大的开展。目前，广播体操和球类运动已逐渐成为千百万劳动群众日常生活中不可缺少的活动，在学校和部队中，并已重点试行了劳卫制。国防体育滑翔、跳伞、航空模型、航海、射击等项运动，在有些地方也已着手试办起来。因为群众性体育运动的开展，对改善人民健康状况，提高劳动、工作和学习效率，就显示出了积极作用。体育运动的技术水平也有了提高。比如在游泳和田径运动中，现在已有三十五项打破了国民党统治时期的全国最高纪录。我国运动员在近两年国际性的运动竞赛中，也开始获得一些成绩。
    我国的体育运动是一项新的事业，几年来的发展，是一个良好的开端。但是，我们的工作还做得很不够，我国体育运动还远远赶不上国家经济建设和国防建设的需要。我们必须继续积极地开展群众性的体育运动，努力增进人民的健康。
    体育运动是增进人民健康的一种最积极有效的科学方法。事实证明，体育运动开展的地方，人们的体质很快就会增强起来。例如：黑龙江省机床一厂第七车间，体育活动开展前，病号很多，出勤率只达百分之八十二左右，生产任务总完不成；自一九五三年四月全厂开展体育活动后，职工体质就逐渐增强起来，从今年一月份起，每月都能保持百分之九十七左右的出勤率，四月份还超额完成国家计划百分之一百一十六。某军区后勤部队一个单位，在开展劳卫制以前，患各种病症的共六十八人，劳卫制实行以后，经过一定时期的锻炼，体质增强，甚至在夏季最热的时候，也没有发生过一个病号。重庆市女中在推行劳卫制预备级的同时，组织了三十一个有轻微肺病和四十三个肺弱的学生参加合理规定的体育运动，经过一学期后，有肺病的好了十七人，肺弱的全部好转。因此，体育运动对于建设社会主义事业是有积极作用的，它可以直接地影响和提高我们在社会主义建设中的劳动效率和劳动热情，加强我们的国防力量。像我在上面所举的工厂、军队和学校的例子一样，全国各地的工厂、矿山、农村、军队、学校、机关如果都开展体育运动，就可以更好地保证每一个工人、农民、战士、学生和国家工作人员能够精力充沛地、坚持不懈地进行劳动，出色地完成自己的任务；并时刻可以准备作一个英勇刚强的战士，保卫祖国不受敌人的侵犯。
    体育运动对于我国人民的社会主义的思想生活和道德品质的锻炼，同样是有着重要的意义的。它能够培养我们年轻一代的勇敢、坚毅、机敏、乐观、组织性、纪律性、集体主义等优良品质，使每个人都身强力壮，朝气勃勃，成为全面发展的建设社会主义社会的新人物。它也能够使老年人保持健旺的精力，获得健康和长寿。这不仅对他们本身是一种幸福，而且他们还能运用丰富的知识和经验参加国家建设事业，为下一代创造更多的幸福。
    现在，全国人民正在为解放台湾和实现第一个五年建设计划而奋斗，为了巩固国防和发展生产，就要采取各种有效措施，努力开展群众性的体育运动，使体育运动在建设社会主义的伟大事业中，发挥更大的作用。
    陈少敏代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意并拥护周恩来同志的政府工作报告。
    五年来，在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的英明领导下，中央人民政府的工作有很大的成就。中央人民政府领导全国人民对国内外敌人进行了胜利的斗争，进行了一系列的社会改革运动和规模巨大的经济恢复工作，逐步地改善了人民的物质生活和文化生活，在这样的胜利基础上，从一九五三年起开始了第一个五年建设计划。在我们人民民主的祖国，广大人民对政府的爱戴是无限的。
    我们的人民政府对于工人阶级的关怀是无微不至的。它先后公布了中华人民共和国工会法、中华人民共和国劳动保险条例、“有关生产的发明、技术改进及合理化建议的奖励暂行条例”等等法令，并拨出大量资金改善工人的劳动条件，为工人建筑宿舍、医院、学校、托儿所和疗养院等集体福利事业。中国工人在帝国主义蒋介石反动政权统治下所梦想不到的幸福，今天成为现实了。广大职工群众从切身生活中深深体验到人民民主制度的优越性；认识到积极生产的目的是建设社会主义，满足人民群众日益增长的物质文化需要。因而他们积极地学习苏联经验，参加劳动竞赛，革新技术，增加生产，厉行节约，以加速社会主义建设的进度。
    中央人民政府各部门的工作有很大成绩，但是在某些部门中仍然存在着某些脱离群众、脱离实际的官僚主义作风。在基本建设和工业生产中的浪费现象还相当严重，譬如：大材小用，把可以利用的原料当下脚处理，甚至有的企业单位把有用的机件当作废铁出卖，有的纺织厂浪费成纱等等，并未及时地受到严肃的批判。苏联纺织模范库契洛娃同志批评我们纺织厂“遍地跑白金”，这确是事实。再如，国家支出大量资金来改善工人的劳动条件和物质、文化生活，可是有些厂矿没有将这笔投资，合理地用来解决生产中和群众生活中最迫切最主要的问题；或者抓住了主要问题又不注意质量。如某厂的措施计划中规定有修建宿舍、盖大礼堂、买垃圾箱、买食品柜等项，但高温车间的降温问题，却没有订在计划之中；有的地方花了许多钱为工人盖宿舍，刚盖起来就漏雨，这就必然引起工人群众的不满。在执行加工订货的政策上也有偏差，如在榨油工业中，一样的原料，有的厂改进了技术，多出了油，但加工费却和出油少的厂一样；还有的按成本核定加工费，成本高的加工费多，成本低的加工费少，结果是鼓励了落后，国家受到损失，工人不满意。群众对浪费国家资财是有意见的，他们提出了许多建议，革新技术，厉行节约，但有些厂矿企业的领导同志并未认真地研究群众意见，依靠群众，改进管理，因而管理工作赶不上生产发展的需要。当然，在缺乏管理经验的情况下，工作中的缺点是难免的，主要的问题不在于工作有缺点，而是在于对这些缺点不够重视，不积极采取措施来克服这些缺点，这就是官僚主义。我想只要人民政府有关部门有计划地、经常地深入基层，深入群众，发现问题，总结经验，表扬进步，批评错误，具体地帮助厂矿企业领导干部依靠群众、改善管理，是能够纠正缺点，大大提高管理水平的。
    工会是共产党联系群众的纽带，是人民政府的支柱，有责任教育广大职工群众，积极地参加企业管理，帮助企业行政克服缺点。但是，我们在这方面的工作作得很不够，特别是没有及时地批判官僚主义作风，这是工会工作中的大缺点，必须纠正。今后，我们在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，在人民政府的支持下，将进一步加强对广大职工群众的政治、文化和技术教育，引导他们切实地遵守宪法，遵守劳动纪律，积极地参加企业管理，深入地开展以技术革新为主要内容的劳动竞赛，厉行节约，增加生产，保证全面地完成国家计划，集中力量为社会主义建设和社会主义改造而斗争。
