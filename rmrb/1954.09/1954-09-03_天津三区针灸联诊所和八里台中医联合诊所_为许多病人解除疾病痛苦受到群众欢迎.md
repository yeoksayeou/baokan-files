The Tianjin Third District Acupuncture Therapy Experimental Joint Clinic and the Balitai Traditional Chinese Medicine Joint Clinic are actively serving the health of the people, relieving the pain of illness for many patients, and are welcomed by the masses.

The Acupuncture Joint Clinic was only officially established in early March this year. According to the clinic's medical effectiveness, acupuncture therapy has good effects on diseases of the nervous system such as nerve paralysis, various neuralgia, digestive system chronic gastroenteritis, women's menstrual diseases, and enuresis; it also has fairly good effects on neurasthenia, high blood pressure, arthritis, and other conditions. According to statistics from the initial three months after the clinic opened, among the 828 patients treated, the most common were diseases of the nervous system, joint inflammation, and the digestive system, totaling 748 people. After treatment, 377 people were cured; the condition of 106 people was alleviated; treatment was ineffective for only 23 people; and 81 people are currently continuing treatment. In addition, the results for 161 people are unknown because they did not persist with treatment.

Many patients have gotten rid of the pain of illness and recovered their health after acupuncture therapy. Ma Jincheng, a 58-year-old cook at the Tianjin branch of the People's Bank of China, suddenly suffered from hemiplegia in June this year, with numbness on the left side of his body and upper and lower limbs, making it impossible for him to walk or move, and even speaking was very difficult. The hospital certified that it was high blood pressure, and his condition was very dangerous. The Joint Clinic administered acupuncture therapy to him, and his symptoms were greatly reduced after a few days, and after fourteen treatments, he returned to normal and resumed work. Comrade Xu Jie of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army suffered from severe rheumatoid arthritis, with swollen joints, making it difficult to walk. After thirteen acupuncture treatments, he was completely cured.

The Joint Clinic currently has eight traditional Chinese medicine doctors who have a political study and technical study session once a week. Through technical study, they have mastered strict disinfection techniques, eliminating the phenomenon of infection and suppuration at some acupuncture points that occurred in the past. In addition, they have also established a system of dedicated personnel responsible for inspection and a consultation system.

The Balitai Traditional Chinese Medicine Joint Clinic has been established for two and a half years and is one of the earliest traditional Chinese medicine joint clinics established in Tianjin. For more than two years, the clinic's doctors have been available to treat patients day and night, as long as patients come for treatment. Sometimes they brave strong winds and heavy rains, travel several miles to the peasant residential areas to treat patients. They also often take the initiative to inquire about patients with serious illnesses. Because the doctors in the clinic have a good attitude toward serving patients, the masses in Balitai and nearby rural areas often come to them for treatment when they are sick. Last summer, the joint clinic needed to be expanded due to increased business, and nearby residents helped them build new houses.

In order to diagnose correctly, the doctors in the Joint Clinic conduct consultations on more difficult and complicated diseases. For example, the mother of Li Yugui, a farmer from Wangdingdi Township in the western suburbs of Tianjin, suffered from hemiplegia and could not eat. She had been treated in three larger hospitals without success. Dr. Wang Ziju and Dr. Zhang Fangyu of the clinic studied together, consulted many medical books, and finally diagnosed it as "wind-phlegm" (i.e., hemiplegia), and decided to implement acupuncture treatment in addition to drug treatment. As a result, the effect was good. After a month of treatment, the patient recovered. In order to adapt to the development of business, the clinic has increased personnel, established a consultation system, night shifts, and clinic affairs meetings, and is equipped with more than 600 kinds of Chinese medicine and more than 100 kinds of Western medicine.

    天津三区针灸联诊所和八里台中医联合诊所
    为许多病人解除疾病痛苦受到群众欢迎
    天津市第三区针灸疗法实验联诊所和八里台中医联合诊所，积极为人民群众健康服务，给许多病人解除了疾病痛苦，受到群众欢迎。
    针灸联诊所今年三月初才正式成立，根据该所的医疗效果证明：针灸疗法对神经系统的疾病如神经麻痹症、各种神经痛、消化系统的慢性肠胃炎、妇女月经病和遗尿症等，都有良好效果；对神经失常、神经衰弱、高血压、关节炎等症效果也相当好。据该联诊所开业后的最初三个月所治疗的八百二十八个病人统计：其中以神经系统、关节炎症和消化系统的疾病为最多，共七百四十八人。经治疗后，痊愈者三百七十七人；病状减轻者一百零六人；治疗无效者仅二十三人；现正在继续治疗者有八十一人。另有一百六十一人因未坚持治疗，结果不详。
    许多病人经过针灸疗法后，摆脱了疾病的痛苦，恢复了健康。中国人民银行天津分行的五十八岁的炊事员马金城，今年六月里忽然患半身不遂，身体左侧和上下肢麻木，不能行走和动作，连说话都十分困难，经医院证明是高血压症，病情很危险。该联诊所为他施行针灸疗法，几天以后症状便大大减轻，十四次以后就恢复常态照常工作。志愿军某部徐杰同志患了很严重的风湿性关节炎，关节部位肿大，走路都很困难。施行针灸疗法十三次以后，病就完全好了。
    该联诊所现在共有八位中医，他们每周规定有一次政治学习和技术学习。他们通过技术学习，掌握了严密的消毒技术，消灭了过去有些针刺部位感染化脓的现象。此外，他们还建立了专人负责检查制度和会诊制度。
    八里台中医联合诊所已经成立两年半，是天津市成立最早的一个中医联合诊所。两年多以来，诊所的大夫们，不分昼夜，只要有病人前来就诊，他们就应诊。有时他们还冒着大风大雨，跑出好几里地，到农民居住区为病人治病。对病情严重者，还往往自动前往探询。由于诊所里的大夫们为病人服务的态度好，八里台及附近农村的群众有了病常来找他们诊治。去年夏天，联合诊所由于业务增多，需要扩建，附近居民便纷纷帮助他们盖建新房。
    为了诊断正确，联合诊所的大夫们每逢较疑难的病症，都进行会诊。如天津西郊区王顶堤乡农民李玉珪的母亲患半身不遂，不能吃饭，去过三个较大医院治疗，都没治好。诊所的王子久大夫和张方舆大夫两人相互研究，参考了许多医书，最后会诊为“风痰”（即半身不遂），决定除用药物治疗外，并施行针灸治疗。结果，效果良好。经一个月的治疗，病人就痊愈了。为了适应业务的发展，该所已增加了人员，建立了会诊、夜间值班与所务会议等制度，并备有六百多种中药和一百多种西药。
