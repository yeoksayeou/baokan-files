    To Guarantee the Steady Supply of Cotton for Yarn Mills and Civilian Wadding
    Commercial Cotton is Now Entirely Purchased by Supply and Marketing Cooperatives on Behalf of the State
    Since the autumn of 1951, supply and marketing cooperatives in all cotton-producing areas across the country have been entrusted by the state to fully carry out the business of purchasing cotton on behalf of the state. Over the past three years (cotton year), the completion of cotton purchase plans has been good. In 1951, 111.5 percent of the plan was completed, in 1952, 106.7 percent, and in 1953, about 99 percent of the cotton purchase plan had been completed by the end of July this year. It is expected that the purchase plan can be completed or overfulfilled. The quantity of cotton purchased has increased year by year. For example, taking the quantity of cotton purchased in 1951 as 100, it was 202 in 1952, and 208 in 1953. In 1952, the cotton purchased by the supply and marketing cooperatives on behalf of the state accounted for about 80 percent of the total national purchase volume, and by 1953, all the commercial cotton needed by the state was purchased by the cooperatives on behalf of the state. Due to the cooperatives' purchase on behalf of the state, the state has timely grasped a large amount of raw cotton, ensuring the steady supply of cotton for yarn mills and civilian wadding. At the same time, because the cooperatives implemented the state's cotton price policy in the purchase on behalf of the state, farmers were no longer subjected to the exploitation of private merchants who lowered the grade and price as in previous years, and they received many benefits. Therefore, they enthusiastically sold good cotton to the state.
    Currently, new cotton is about to be put on the market in large quantities. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions are appropriately adjusting and adding purchasing stations, training personnel, organizing processing forces, strengthening market management, and conducting publicity and education for farmers in order to smoothly complete this year's task of purchasing new cotton.

    保证纱厂用棉和民用絮棉的源源供应
    商品棉花已全由供销合作社代购
    从一九五一年秋季开始，全国各产棉区的供销合作社接受国家委托全面开展代购棉花的业务，三年（棉花年度）以来，购棉计划完成情况良好。一九五一年完成百分之一百十一点五，一九五二年完成百分之一百零六点七，一九五三年的购棉计划到今年七月底已完成百分之九十九左右，预计可以完成或超额完成收购计划。棉花收购数量逐年增加。如以一九五一年的棉花收购数量为一○○，一九五二年为二○二，一九五三年已达到二○八。一九五二年供销合作社代购的棉花约占国家总收购量百分之八十，到一九五三年国家所需要的商品棉花就全部由合作社代购。由于合作社的代购，国家及时掌握了大量原棉，保证了纱厂用棉和民用絮棉的源源供应。同时因为合作社在代购中贯彻了国家的棉价政策，农民不再像往年那样受私商压级压价的剥削，得到了许多好处，因此踊跃把好棉花卖给国家。
    目前，新棉就要大量上市，各地供销合作社正在适当调整和增设收购站，训练人员，组织加工力量，加强市场管理，并向农民进行宣传教育，以便顺利完成今年收购新棉的任务。　（新华社）
