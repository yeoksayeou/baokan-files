	The Treasure Trove of Art
	——Introducing the Artworks Hall in the Exhibition of Achievements in Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction
	By our reporter Bai Sheng

	In two interconnected halls of the Southern Culture Pavilion of the Soviet Exhibition Hall, are displayed famous Soviet oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, prints, and illustrations from literary masterpieces. When people enter the hall, they are immediately drawn to these outstanding artworks.

	There are a total of 280 artworks exhibited here, including 102 oil paintings, 28 sculptures, and 150 prints, etc.

	These precious artworks fully demonstrate the socialist realism creation method and national characteristics of Soviet art, and truthfully and profoundly reflect the real life of the Soviet people. Some of them are from the hands of Soviet art masters, and some are works by young painters.

	Here are paintings with the theme of great historical events and the images of great leaders. "All Power to the Soviets, Peace to All Peoples!" is a collective creation by five painters, including D. A. Nalbandyan. This grand painting reflects a historically significant scene: the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets passed the Decree on Peace drafted by Lenin on November 8, 1917. This painting shows that from the very first day of its establishment, the Soviet Republic resolutely implemented a policy of peace. The images of Lenin, Stalin, Sverdlov, and Dzerzhinsky are filled with confidence in the victory of socialist construction. The vast conference hall is crowded with soldiers, sailors, and workers, all attentively listening to the leaders' speeches. The familiar painting "Great Friendship" depicts the historic meeting between Chairman Mao, the leader of the Chinese people, and Comrade Stalin. The author of this painting is D. A. Nalbandyan, Honored Art Worker of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic, Academician of the Soviet Academy of Arts, and multiple winner of the Stalin Prize. The oil painting "The Morning of Our Motherland" is a masterpiece by F. S. Shurpin, winner of the Stalin Prize, and won the Stalin Prize in 1948. In the vast field, facing the morning sun of spring, Comrade Stalin walks, wearing a white shirt and carrying his coat over his arm. The image of the great teacher symbolizes the advance of communist victory.

	Among the outstanding Soviet artworks, many are lifelike portraits. The authors brilliantly portray the advanced figures in socialist construction, expressing the noble qualities of Soviet people. "Group Portrait of Painters" is an outstanding work by Soviet art master, President of the Soviet Academy of Arts, and multiple winner of the Stalin Prize, A. M. Gerasimov. With rich brushstrokes, he depicts the portraits of four veteran painters: I. N. Pavlov, People's Artist of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic, V. N. Bakshiyev, People's Artist of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic, V. K. Byalynitsky-Birulya, People's Artist of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic and the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, and V. N. Meshkov, People's Artist of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic. "Excellent Female Student," painted by M. M. Pozhiy, a painter from Odessa in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, is also an excellent portrait, which truly expresses the image of an excellent Soviet female student.

	Among the exhibited works, there are also many immortal works depicting heroic images from the Soviet Patriotic War period. "Tanya" is an unforgettable oil painting by the famous Soviet painter Kukryniksy. "Glory to the Fallen Heroes" is a painting that gives a deep impression. The mother's face reveals grief and love. The author, F. S. Bogorodsky, wrote at the bottom of the painting: "In memory of my fallen son." How touching these words are! In the center of the exhibition hall, there is also a giant painting, "Defenders of the Brest Fortress!" The painter P. A. Krivonogov powerfully depicts the heroic faces of the Soviet Red Army.

	Genre paintings of socialist realism reflecting the lives of the Soviet people also have profound ideological content. For example, A. I. Laktionov's oil painting "Letter from the Front" depicts an episode in the rear during the Soviet Patriotic War: a soldier wounded at the front returns to the rear to bring a letter home for another soldier. In the picture, the bright summer sunshine shines, an elderly woman - the mother - leaning against the door frame, holding the opened envelope, happily listening to the Young Pioneer sitting on the stool outside the door reading the letter from the front. On the other side of the door frame, a little girl stands quietly. Near the Young Pioneer, a girl rests her elbow on the railing, listening. The wounded soldier smokes a cigarette, attentively listening to the familiar words of his comrade. "The Newly Published Workshop Wall Newspaper," jointly created by Soviet young painters A. V. Levitin and Yu. N. Tulin, is also a very eye-catching oil painting. Among the crowd reading the wall newspaper, the painter places a young worker in a red vest in the most prominent and important position. From the worker's expression and the expressions of the workers around him, it is clear that he is someone who has made a mistake in his work and has been criticized in the wall newspaper. The famous painting "Another Two" which is familiar to the Chinese people, is also exhibited in the exhibition hall. This is a masterpiece by F. P. Reshetnikov, winner of the Stalin Prize. The author vividly depicts the unpleasant emotions caused by a child's failing grade in a family. "Spring" by the Ukrainian female painter T. N. Yablonskaya, fully expresses the prosperity and growth of human youth on Soviet soil. Here, children are playing innocently and happily. The new generation is full of vigor. The colors of this picture are extremely bright, giving people a very pleasant feeling.

	In addition, many works such as "Receiving Komsomol Members - People of the Stalin Era" and "We Are Heading Towards Life" have left a deep impression on people.

	In front of the center of the hall stands the bronze statue of "Worker and Collective Farm Woman." A pair of young men and women full of wisdom and strength hold high the hammer and sickle. This is the immortal masterpiece of the late famous Soviet sculptor V. I. Mukhina. It was exhibited at the Soviet Pavilion of the 1937 Paris World Expo and attracted the attention of the world's art circles. This work profoundly embodies the great future of socialism. In the center of the southern hall, there is also a bronze group portrait of the famous Ukrainian poet Shevchenko, a masterpiece by M. G. Manizer, Vice-President of the Soviet Academy of Arts and multiple winner of the Stalin Prize. From this bronze statue, one can seem to see the history of the Ukrainian people's struggle.

	The artworks displayed in the southern hall mainly include exquisite watercolors, prints, and illustrations for literary works. Here are the exquisite illustrations drawn by Kukryniksy for Gogol's novella "The Overcoat", the exquisite illustrations drawn by O. G. Vereisky for Sholokhov's novel "Quiet Don", the illustrations drawn by S. V. Gerasimov for Ostrovsky's play "The Storm", and the exquisite illustrations by A. M. Laptev for Gogol's "Dead Souls".

	There are also political cartoons by outstanding Soviet cartoonists Kukryniksy, Yefimov, Ganf, and others.

    美术作品的宝库
    ——介绍苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会中的美术作品馆
    本报记者　柏生
    在苏联展览馆南文化馆的两间相连的大厅里，陈列着苏联著名的油画、雕塑、水彩、版画和文学名著的插图。当人们走进大厅的时候，就立刻被那些杰出的艺术作品所吸引。
    这里展出的美术作品共二百八十件，其中有油画一百零二幅，雕塑二十八件，版画等一百五十幅。
    这些珍贵的美术作品，充分地表现了苏联美术的社会主义现实主义的创作方法和民族特色，真实地深刻地反映了苏联人民的现实生活。其中有的出自苏联艺术大师的手笔，有的是青年画家的作品。
    这里有着以伟大历史事件和伟大领袖的形象为主题的画幅。“政权归苏维埃，和平归于各族人民！”是德·阿·纳尔班殿等五位画家的集体创作。这幅巨画反映着一段具有历史意义的情节：一九一七年十一月八日第二次全俄苏维埃代表大会通过了列宁所拟定的和平法令。这幅画表现出苏维埃共和国从它成立的第一天起，就坚决执行着和平政策。列宁、斯大林、斯维尔德洛夫和捷尔任斯基的形象，充满了对社会主义建设的胜利信心。宏大的会议厅内挤满了战士、水手和工人群众，他们都全神贯注地倾听着领袖的讲话。为我们十分熟悉的画幅“伟大的友谊”，描绘了中国人民领袖毛主席和斯大林同志具有历史意义的会见。这幅画的作者是俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国功勋艺术工作者、苏联美术学院院士、斯大林奖金多次获得者德·阿·纳尔班殿。油画“我们祖国的早晨”，是斯大林奖金得奖者费·萨·叔尔宾的杰作，曾获得一九四八年斯大林奖金。在广阔的原野上，迎着春天早晨的阳光，斯大林同志行走着，他穿着白色的上衣，手臂上挂着外套，伟大导师的形象，象征着共产主义胜利的前进。
    杰出的苏联美术作品中，有许多是栩栩如生的肖像画。作者卓越地刻划了社会主义建设中的先进人物，表现了苏维埃人的崇高品质。“画家群像”是苏联艺术大师、苏联美术学院院长、斯大林奖金多次获得者亚·米·格拉西莫夫的卓越作品。他以丰厚的画笔写出了俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国人民美术家依·尼·巴甫洛夫，俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国人民美术家华·尼·巴克什也夫，俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国以及别洛露西亚苏维埃社会主义共和国人民美术家维·卡·比雅雷尼茨基—比卢略和俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国人民美术家华·尼·麦什科夫等四位老画家的肖像。乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国敖德萨的画家米·米波日依画的“女优等生”，也是一幅出色的肖像画，它真实地表达了苏联优良女学生的形象。
    在展览作品中，还有许多是描绘苏联卫国战争期中英雄形象的不朽作品。“丹娘”是一幅令人难忘的油画，出自苏联著名画家库克雷尼克塞的手笔。“光荣属于阵亡的英雄们”，是一幅给人以深刻感触的画幅。母亲的颜面上流露着悲痛和慈爱。作者费·谢·波戈罗德斯基在画的下边写着：“纪念我的阵亡的儿子”。这句话是多么感人呀！在展览厅正中还有一幅巨画“布里斯特要塞的保卫者！”，画家彼·亚·克里沃诺果夫以有力的笔触写出了苏联红军的英雄面貌。
    反映苏联人民生活的社会主义现实主义的风俗画同样有着深刻的思想内容。例如亚·依·拉克提昂诺夫的油画“前线来信”，它写出了苏联卫国战争时期后方生活中的一个插曲：一个在前线受伤的战士回到后方来，替另一个战士带回了家书。画面上灿烂夺目的夏季阳光照耀着，一个上了年纪的妇人——母亲依着门框，手里拿着拆开的信封，愉快地倾听着坐在门外方凳上的少先队员念着前线来信。在门框另一边一个小女孩安静地站着。在少先队员的近旁，一个少女把肘支在栏杆上听着。那受伤的战士吸着香烟，聚精会神地听着他所熟悉的伙伴的语言。苏联青年画家安·巴·列维亭和尤·尼·屠林共同创作的“刚出版的车间墙报”，也是极引观众注目的一幅油画。在看墙报的人群中，画家把一位穿红背心的青年工人安置在一个最显著最重要的位置上，人们从这个工人的表情以及他周围的工人们的表情中，可以明显地看出他是一个在工作中犯了错误而被墙报批评了的人。为中国人民所熟悉的“又是一个两分”这张名画，也在展览厅中展出了。这是斯大林奖金得奖者费·巴·列舍特尼科夫的杰作。作者生动地写出了一个家庭中由于孩子学习成绩不及格而引起的不愉快的情绪。乌克兰女画家塔·尼·雅布伦斯卡娅的“春天”，充分地表达了人类的青春在苏维埃国土上繁荣滋长。这里，儿童们在天真幸福地游戏着。新生的一代充满着蓬勃的朝气。这幅画面的色彩极为鲜明，给予人们一种非常愉快的感觉。
    此外，像“接收共青团员—斯大林时代的人”、“我们走向生活”等许多作品，都给人们留下了极深刻的印象。
    在大厅正中前面，耸立着“工人与集体农庄女庄员”的青铜雕像。一对充满智慧和力量的青年男女高举着锤子和镰刀。这是苏联已故的著名大雕刻家薇·依·穆希娜的不朽杰作。一九三七年曾在巴黎世界博览会苏联馆展出，受到全世界艺术界的注目。这一作品深刻地体现了社会主义的伟大前程。在南端大厅的正中，还有乌克兰著名诗人舍甫琴科的铜制群像，这是苏联美术学院副院长、斯大林奖金多次获得者马·耿·马尼节尔的杰作。人们从这座铜像上，就仿佛看到了乌克兰人民斗争的历史。
    在美术作品的南端大厅中陈列的，主要是一些精致的水彩画、版画和文学作品的插图。这里有库克雷尼克塞为果戈理中篇小说“外套”绘制的精致的插图，奥·盖·魏列依斯基为萧洛霍夫长篇小说“静静的顿河”绘制的精致插图，谢·华·格拉西莫夫为奥斯特洛夫斯基“大雷雨”剧本绘制的插图，以及阿·米·拉普昂夫给果戈理“死魂灵”作的精致插图。
    这里还有苏联卓越的漫画家库克雷尼克塞、叶菲莫夫、冈夫等作的政治讽刺画。
