    Vietnam is Carrying Out a Vigorous Land Reform Movement
    Huang Guoyue, Member of the Central Land Reform Committee of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam

    The countryside of the liberated areas of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is undergoing a thorough transformation. Under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the People's Government, thousands of farmers are rising up to fight for the abolition of the land ownership of the landlord class and the complete realization of rent reduction. The struggle of the peasants has won the warm support of people from all walks of life.

    The Vietnamese people clearly remember the brutal exploitation and rule of the feudal landlord class for thousands of years. This system is the root cause of the poverty of the Vietnamese people and the reason why Vietnam is backward and has been invaded. The corrupt feudal monarchs, after offering Vietnam to the French colonialists, were willing to continue to act as lackeys of the French colonialists. For nearly a century, the Vietnamese feudal landlord class has become a tool for French imperialism to oppress and exploit the Vietnamese people. In the villages where peasants are mobilized, it is clearer to see that from the Bao Dai puppet emperor, the provincial governors, all the way down to the local tyrants and evil gentry in the villages, are all directly controlled by French imperialism and hand-picked from the most reactionary elements of the landlord class. This is a characteristic that distinguishes colonies and semi-colonies. French imperialism maintained the land ownership of the feudal landlord class. Moreover, French colonists blatantly seized vast areas of plantations to directly exploit Vietnamese peasants. According to preliminary statistics, the landlord class and French colonists, who account for less than five percent of the population, occupy more than seventy-five percent of the land, while the vast number of peasants, who account for ninety percent of the total population of Vietnam, only occupy about twenty-five percent of the land, most of which is barren. Vietnam is a country with fertile land and abundant agricultural products, which people call “the land of gold.” But for many years, Vietnamese peasants have still lived in extreme poverty. The "land of gold" is controlled by the landlord class and French colonists.

    This unfair land system is the cornerstone of the extremely cruel exploitation and oppression of Vietnamese peasants by the landlord class in collusion with imperialism.

    After several mobilizations of the masses for rent reduction and land reform, the peasants exposed all the heinous crimes of the landlord class. For example, fifty-four local despotic landlords in twenty villages in Nghệ An province beat to death 249 people, injured 416 people, and arrested 1,992 people. In particular, Nguyễn Thị Năm, a despotic landlord in Đồng Bẩm village, Thái Nguyên province, had the blood of 300 people on her hands. The landlord class used barbarous tortures such as live burial, burning alive, and burying children alive to worship gods and protect wealth to threaten and kill peasants. They blatantly seized the land reclaimed by the peasants, and the wives and daughters of the peasants were insulted by them. One landlord raped 200 women, and another landlord raped and murdered 10 women. The means by which the Vietnamese feudal class squeezed the peasants were also extremely vicious. They exploited the blood and sweat of the working people in the form of high rents and interest, empty rent [Note 1], uniform rent [Note 2], corvée rent, and sub-rent. Peasants had to pay 60 percent of the harvest to the landlords, and many had to pay 80 percent. Many families had no food to eat after the harvest, and they worked hard all year round but could not get enough to eat and wear. They were forced to sell their wives and daughters and leave their homes to make a living elsewhere, but they still could not escape the clutches of the landlord class. Under the shackles of the landlord class, Vietnamese peasants have been living a subhuman life. The Vietnamese landlord class has shown itself to be an extremely brutal and reactionary class. Vietnamese history proves the truth stated by Chairman Mao Zedong: "If the rule of imperialism is not overthrown, the rule of the feudal landlord class cannot be eliminated, because imperialism is the main supporter of the feudal landlord class. Conversely, because the feudal landlord class is the main social base for imperialism to rule China, and the peasants are the main force of the Chinese revolution, if the peasants are not helped to overthrow the feudal landlord class, a strong force for the Chinese revolution cannot be formed to overthrow the rule of imperialism." The Vietnamese landlord class and imperialism colluded closely with each other, like two big mountains blocking the Vietnamese people from moving towards independence, freedom, and happiness. The Vietnamese revolution must crush these two vicious enemies, defeat foreign imperialism and overthrow the oppression of the domestic feudal landlord class. The 1945 Vietnamese "August Revolution" overthrew the rule of imperialism and the feudal landlord class and established a people's democratic regime; but the newly established democratic regime did not have time to carry out democratic reforms and had to deal with the war of aggression provoked by the French colonialists. Therefore, the economic foundation of the feudal landlord class was still not abolished, and it increasingly hindered the war of resistance. After the August Revolution, in order to protect their own interests, the feudal landlord class continued to collude with imperialism to carry out anti-people activities. They established puppet regimes and puppet troops in the enemy-occupied areas, and actively conscripted laborers and soldiers and plundered the people's property for the French colonialists and American interventionists in order to realize the policy of "using Vietnamese to fight Vietnamese and supporting the war with war." They have become loyal lackeys of French and American imperialism. In the liberated areas, they took advantage of our negligence to infiltrate the Party organizations, people's regimes, and people's organizations in the countryside, maintained their political power in the countryside, and continued to suppress and exploit the peasants. They distorted and sabotaged the war of resistance policies, opposed agricultural taxes, opposed going to work as laborers, prevented young peasants from joining the army, and hindered and sabotaged production, using every means to oppose the government's rent and interest reduction decrees. Moreover, they also indicated targets for enemy planes to bomb government agencies, dikes, and people's houses. For example, the Vietnamese traitor and landlord Nguyễn Hữu Ngọc in Thanh Hóa province directed enemy planes to bomb the PảI Thượng dike, causing more than 50,000 mu of land to be short of water and unable to be cultivated. They also brazenly claimed that "they want to starve the peasants to death, defeat the war of resistance, and rebuild the dikes and take back the land after the Americans come." The feudal landlord class also established reactionary organizations such as the "Kuomintang" and the "Welcoming France Association" to carry out espionage and sabotage activities in the rear. Peasants are the main source of manpower and material resources for the war of resistance. Most of the People's Army are peasants with guns. Peasants support the troops with production and participate in labor teams to transport ammunition to the troops. Peasants are the main force of the war of resistance, and their lives should have been improved. But in fact, they still live in poverty because the land ownership of the feudal landlord class still exists, the landlord class still rules the countryside, and continues to cruelly exploit and oppress the peasants.

    The more the war of resistance develops, the more the landlord class exposes its reactionary face of colluding closely with imperialism to oppose the war of resistance. The more the war of resistance develops, the more it needs to mobilize more manpower and material resources, so it is even more necessary to liberate the huge productivity and war of resistance power in the countryside. Carrying out land reform to eliminate the landlord class, abolish the land ownership of the feudal landlord class, and realize "land to the tillers" has not only become a basic requirement of the Vietnamese people's democratic revolution, but has also become the most urgent requirement of the current war of resistance.

    Based on the above-mentioned actual situation, President Ho Chi Minh and the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party decided to carry out land reform during the war of resistance to strengthen the power of the war of resistance. In the spring of 1953, President Ho personally signed a decree to mobilize the masses to implement the rent reduction policy. In January 1954, the Vietnamese government and the National Assembly promulgated a historic decree abolishing the feudal landlord land ownership system in Vietnam for thousands of years, and began to implement land reform in the liberated areas to realize "land to the tillers."

    The land reform in Vietnam is basically the same as the land reform in other people's democratic countries. It aims to abolish the land ownership of the feudal landlord class, realize "land to the tillers," liberate the productive forces in the countryside, develop the national economy, and create conditions for the development of the people's democratic system. However, the land reform in Vietnam is carried out in the environment of the war of resistance, so some aspects of the policies and methods are not exactly the same.

    The general line of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the Vietnamese government in the countryside is: "Rely on poor and landless peasants, unite with middle peasants, unite with rich peasants, overthrow the landlord class, eliminate the feudal exploitation system step by step and separately, develop agricultural production, and powerfully promote the war of resistance."

    Because the land reform in Vietnam is carried out during the war of resistance, it must concentrate all its forces to strike at the most important enemy—the imperialist aggressors. Therefore, the peasants' struggle must be carried out quickly, well, and in an orderly manner. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to completely divide and isolate the landlord class. Therefore, the landlord class can be dealt with separately according to their political attitudes. In economic terms, four methods are implemented to abolish the feudal land ownership of landlords: "Confiscate the land and property of landlords, Vietnamese traitors, reactionaries, and local tyrants and evil gentry"; "Purchase the land of democratic people, landlords who participated in the war of resistance, and general landlords"; "Levy public land and semi-public and semi-private land"; "Levy and purchase land of religious organizations." Although various landlords should be treated separately, the ultimate goal is still to completely abolish the feudal land ownership of landlords to meet the economic needs of peasants—mainly poor and landless peasants.

    Since the land reform is carried out during the war of resistance, in order to completely isolate the landlord class, the issue of uniting with rich peasants is raised. Generally speaking, the feudal exploitation of rich peasants is not very serious in Vietnam. The land rented out by rich peasants only accounts for 18 to 20 percent of the land owned by rich peasants, and rich peasants generally participate in the war of resistance and agree to oppose imperialism and feudalism. Therefore, they are united politically and preserved economically. Only when the land rented out by rich peasants exceeds twice the land they cultivate themselves, will their rented land be purchased.

    The correct line of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the People's Government, which is suitable for the actual situation in Vietnam, has mobilized the vast number of peasants to struggle against the landlord class and has won the active support of people from all walks of life. Therefore, the work of mobilizing the masses has been carried out smoothly.

    From January 1953 to today, the rent reduction movement in the Việt Bắc Liên Khu, Liên Khu 3, and Liên Khu 4 has expanded from nine villages to 826 villages with a population of 3.5 million. In January 1954, the first phase of the land reform experiment was carried out in six villages in Thái Nguyên province and achieved great success. At present, the land reform movement has been expanded to 53 villages in Thái Nguyên and Thanh Hóa provinces.

    The rent reduction movement and land reform are continuing to be carried out in Vietnam and have achieved initial victories. It has changed the face of a part of the Vietnamese countryside and made it look brand new. It has played a great role in the recent victories in various aspects of the war of resistance and has created more conditions for the Vietnamese people to move towards new victories.

    Economically, after four rent reduction movements, the economic power of the landlord class has been initially weakened, and the economic demands of the working peasants have been partially met. In the four rent reduction movements in the nine provinces of the Việt Bắc Liên Khu alone, 14,211 mu of land and 2,650 head of cattle were confiscated from Vietnamese traitors, reactionaries, local tyrants and evil gentry. Landlords were forced to return 12,262 tons of grain, which was distributed to 177,479 households with 345,685 people. In the land reform in the six pilot villages in Thái Nguyên province, 2,609 mu, 6 sào [Note 3], and 12 thước of land, 352 head of cattle, 1,062 plows and other farm implements, and 26 tons and 47 kg of grain were confiscated, levied, and purchased from the landlord class and distributed to peasants with little or no land. 56.2% of the population received land and the fruits of victory. On average, each poor peasant received 5 sào and 6 thước of land, each landless peasant received 5 sào of land, and on average, each person could harvest 280 kg of grain per year, excluding miscellaneous grains. In the past, land was a tool used by the landlord class to exploit peasants, but today it has become a source of happiness for peasants. The feudal landlords' land ownership, which had been oppressing Vietnamese peasants for thousands of years, was permanently abolished.

    Politically, the political power of the landlord class was initially crushed in the rent reduction movement. Peasants in 600 villages exposed the crimes of 10,147 landlords. 12% of the local despotic landlords were fought by the peasants, and they all had to bow their heads to confess their crimes and repay the peasants' blood debts. 1.3% of the landlords who committed heinous crimes were sentenced to death by the people's court, and 12% of the landlords were sentenced to labor reform. Even so, the remaining forces of the landlord class in the countryside still exist. Therefore, in the subsequent rent reduction movement, they still actively carried out activities such as opposing peasants, dispersing property, bribing cadres, threatening backbone elements, and detaining peasants. At the same time, they sent their lackeys to infiltrate the leadership organs in the villages to directly control the countryside.

    The land reform carried out in the six pilot villages completely crushed the prestige of the landlord class, and the movement to mobilize the masses was further deepened. 60 landlords who had escaped the net were discovered, including 15 Vietnamese traitors and local tyrants and evil gentry. The landlords in all six villages had to report their history of making a fortune to the people and bow their heads to confess their crimes to the people. 8% of the landlords who committed serious crimes against the peasants were sentenced to death.

    A huge political achievement of the land reform movement was the rectification of the basic-level organizations of the Party, government, and people's organizations in the countryside, the expulsion of landlords and their lackeys who had infiltrated and controlled the rural Party, government, and people's organizations, the purification of the basic-level organizations in the countryside, and the further consolidation and development of the victory of the land reform. The rural Party branches expelled all exploiting elements and absorbed a large number of activists from among the poor and landless peasants. Poor and landless peasant Party members previously accounted for only 15% of the rural Party branches, but now they have reached 60%, which has purified the Party branches, strengthened their combat effectiveness, and made them a powerful political leadership core in the countryside. After the rent reduction movement, the number of members of the peasants' association accounted for about 27% of the rural population. In the villages that have undergone land reform, the number of members of the peasants' association has developed to account for about 40% of the rural population, which has expanded and consolidated the national united front in the countryside. Various youth and women's organizations have been established on this strong class foundation. Various village government agencies are controlled by the best backbone elements among the poor and landless peasants. The rule of the landlord class has been crushed, and the working peasants have become the masters of the countryside today.

    Ideologically, the class consciousness of the peasants has been greatly improved. Almost all the poor, landless, and middle peasants have participated in the grievance meetings. All the crimes of the landlord class have been exposed. People from all walks of life have clearly seen the reactionary face of the landlord class, so they are more actively supporting the peasants' struggle. Peasants, like people from all walks of life, have realized that the landlord class and imperialism, which are closely colluding with each other, are the two major enemies of the Vietnamese people. Today, a new ideology dominates the countryside. The landlord class, which "enjoys the fruits of its labor without working," is no longer a class that people fear. After the land reform, Comrade Ding, the leader of the peasants' association in Độc Lập village, said: "Today's landlords are like mad dogs, and everyone wants to beat them. As for me, I really want to live now, because before, no one wanted to listen to me when I spoke, and I didn't dare to raise my head when I walked. Today, thanks to the leadership of President Ho and the Party, we peasants have stood up."

    Peasants feel even more that President Ho and the Labor Party are their saviors, and they realize that the people's regime truly serves the interests of the people. After the peasants received land, they launched a movement to learn culture. They often said: "We can get enough to eat and wear today and learn culture. These are the happy lives that Uncle Ho brought us, so we must resolutely defend them." The peasants actively implemented all the policies of the Party and the government. In the villages where the peasants have been mobilized, they enthusiastically participated in the army and labor teams, and the number of people who participated exceeded the number of people needed. After evaluation, some people had to be left behind. The peasants in Thái Nguyên province completed the payment of the provisional agricultural tax for the summer of 1954 one month ahead of schedule with an excess of 135%, sent more than 3 million laborers to the front line to serve, and ensured the overfulfillment of the production plan by 2%. After the peasants received land, they actively engaged in production. They said: "In the past, we worked for the landlords, but today we work for ourselves." Under the leadership of the Labor Party, they are embarking on the road of organizing and developing production. After the rent reduction movement, the peasants in 23 villages in Phú Thọ province added 413 mutual aid teams, dug 983 small canals, irrigated an additional 4,908 mu of land, and increased production by 50%.

    After the peasants' strength was mobilized, the work of resisting the war was greatly strengthened, especially the fighting spirit of the troops. When the soldiers in Điện Biên Phủ heard the news that the first phase of the land reform pilot work had achieved victory, they all wrote letters of determination: "For world peace, for the independence of the motherland, for the peasants and the land in our homes, we are determined to completely eliminate the invading army."

    Vietnam's land reform movement is expanding and has achieved initial victories. It has paved the way for more and greater victories in the future. This victory was achieved under the correct leadership of President Ho, the Vietnam Workers' Party, and the People's Government, as well as the Vietnamese peasants' deep hatred for the landlord class, and with the sympathy and support of the entire people.

    The huge impact of China's land reform movement is also one of the factors in this victory. The earth-shaking struggle carried out by hundreds of millions of Chinese peasants under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party has greatly encouraged the fighting spirit of the Vietnamese peasants. The film "The White Haired Girl" was welcomed by peasants all over Vietnam. After watching this film, the peasants said: "Crows are as black as crows all over the world. Landlords everywhere are full of sins." The common hatred of the people of the two countries towards the landlord class has strengthened the friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese people. Vietnamese peasants often say: "In order to live a beautiful and happy life in the socialist system like the people of the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries, we must carry out a resolute struggle." The victory of the rent reduction movement and land reform in the Vietnamese liberated areas has had a huge impact on people from all walks of life, especially on the peasants and puppet troops in the enemy-occupied areas. In order to reduce this impact and deceive the people, imperialism and its puppets have also put forward a so-called "land" policy since 1952, the content of which is still to protect the interests of the landlord class, confiscate the land of cadres participating in the war of resistance, and distribute it to their lackeys. For several years, they have not and cannot implement any measures that are beneficial to the peasants. Based on their personal experience, the peasants are increasingly aware that only a government like the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has the strength and can truly carry out large-scale and thorough reforms in the countryside for the benefit of the peasants.

    Today, peace has been re-established in Indochina. The Vietnamese people are in a better position and must strengthen land reform even more. Because the success of land reform will create conditions for the Vietnamese people to rebuild the motherland that has been destroyed by the war, and will make the people of the whole country more trusting of the democratic republic government led by President Ho, and thus more actively struggle for the unification of the motherland. The success of land reform will fully unleash the potential strength of the Vietnamese people in all aspects; provide the Vietnamese people with a guarantee of victory in the struggle to defend peace, achieve unification, and complete independence and democracy. It will completely change the face of the Vietnamese countryside and Vietnamese society, and stride forward along the road of people's democratic revolution taken by the fraternal countries in the people's democratic and socialist family.

      [Note 1] Empty rent - For example, if a landlord rents three mu of land to a peasant, but collects rent for five mu of land, the rent for those two mu of land without land is called empty rent.
      [Note 2] Uniform rent - When a landlord rents land, regardless of whether the land is good or bad, rent is collected uniformly at the rate of the best land.
      [Note 3] Sào - Ten sào is equal to one Vietnamese mu, and one Vietnamese mu is approximately equal to 5.5 Chinese mu.

    越南正在进行轰轰烈烈的土地改革运动
    越南民主共和国中央土地改革委员会委员  黄国越
    越南民主共和国解放区的农村正进行着一个彻底的变革。在越南劳动党和人民政府的领导下，成千上万的农民正奋起为废除地主阶级的土地所有制和彻底实现减租而斗争。农民的斗争获得了各阶层人民的热烈拥护。
    越南人民都清楚地记得封建地主阶级几千年来的残暴剥削和统治制度，这种制度就是越南人民贫困的根源，也是越南之所以落后和被侵略的原因。腐败的封建王侯在把越南奉献给法殖民者之后，又甘心继续作法殖民者的走狗。近一世纪以来，越南的封建地主阶级已变成了法帝国主义压迫和剥削越南人民的工具。在农民被发动起来的乡村里，可以更清楚地看到了从保大傀儡皇帝、各省省长起一直到乡村里的土豪劣绅，都是由法帝国主义直接掌握并一手从地主阶级最反动的分子中挑选出来的。这是区别殖民地和半殖民地的一个特点。法帝国主义维持了封建地主阶级的土地所有制。不仅如此，法殖民者还明目张胆地霸占了面积广大的种植园来直接剥削越南农民。据初步统计，人口不到百分之五的地主阶级和法殖民者就占有百分之七十五以上的土地；而占越南总人口百分之九十的广大农民只占有约百分之二十五的大部分是贫瘠的土地。越南是一个土地肥沃、农产物富饶的国家，人们称之为
  “遍地黄金之地”。但是越南农民多少年来仍然生活在极其穷困之中，“遍地黄金之地”掌握在地主阶级和法殖民者的手里。
    这种不公平的土地制度是地主阶级与帝国主义勾结起来极其残酷地剥削和压迫越南农民的基石。
    经过几次发动群众进行减租和土地改革之后，农民揭穿了地主阶级的一切滔天罪行。例如义安省二十个乡的五十四个恶霸地主就打死过二百四十九个人，打伤过四百一十六人，逮捕了一千九百九十二人。特别是太原省同禀乡的恶霸地主阮氏南，他的手上沾染了三百个人的鲜血。地主阶级使用野蛮的极刑如活埋、活活烧死、活埋小孩来祭神保财等，威胁和残杀农民。他们明目张胆地霸占了农民开垦的土地，农民的妻女遭到他们的污辱，有一名地主奸污了二百个妇女，另一个地主强奸和杀害了十个妇女。越南封建阶级压榨农民的手段也是毒辣无比的，他们以高额的地租和利息、空头租〔注一〕、一律租〔注二〕、劳役租、副租等形式来剥削劳动人民的血汗，农民要把收获的百分之六十缴纳给地主，有许多人要缴纳到百分之八十。很多家庭在收割后就没有粮食吃，整年辛辛苦苦却不得温饱。他们被迫卖妻鬻女、离开了家乡到他处谋生，但仍然逃不出地主阶级的魔掌。在地主阶级的枷锁之下，越南农民一直过着非人的生活。越南地主阶级已经表现出了他们是一个极其残暴和反动的阶级。越南的历史证明了毛泽东主席所说的真理：“如果不推翻帝国主义的统治，就不能消灭封建地主阶级的统治，因为帝国主义是封建地主阶级的主要支持者。反之，因为封建地主阶级是帝国主义统治中国的主要社会基础，而农民则是中国革命的主力军，如果不帮助农民推翻封建地主阶级，就不能组成中国革命的强大的队伍而推翻帝国主义的统治。”越南地主阶级和帝国主义互相紧密地勾结起来，像两座大山似地阻挡着越南人民向独立、自由、幸福迈进的道路。越南革命必须粉碎这两个凶恶的敌人，必须打败国外的帝国主义和推翻国内封建地主阶级的压迫。一九四五年的越南“八月革命”推翻了帝国主义和封建地主阶级的统治，建立了人民民主政权；但新建立的民主政权还来不及进行民主改革，就不得不来对付由法殖民者挑起的侵略战争。因此，封建地主阶级的经济基础仍然没有被废除，而且它对抗战日益起了阻碍作用。八月革命以后，封建地主阶级为了保卫他们自己的利益，继续与帝国主义勾结起来进行反人民的活动。他们在敌占区里成立了伪政权和伪军，积极为法殖民者和美国干涉者抓夫、抓兵、搜括人民财产，以实现“用越南人打越南人，以战养战”的政策，他们已成为了法、美帝国主义的忠实走狗。在解放区里，他们利用我们的疏忽大意混进了农村中的党组织、人民政权和各人民团体里，维持他们在农村的政治势力，继续镇压和剥削农民。他们歪曲和破坏抗战政策，反对农业税，反对去当民工，阻止青年农民参军，阻碍和破坏生产，用一切办法来反对政府的减租减息法令。不仅如此，他们还给敌人的飞机指示目标，轰炸政府机关、堤坝和人民的住宅。例如清化省的越奸地主阮友玉曾指示敌机轰炸沛上堤坝，使五万多亩土地缺水，无法耕种。他们还肆无忌惮地声称“要使农民饿死，抗战失败，美国人来后将重建堤坝，收回土地”。封建地主阶级还成立了“国民党”、“迎法会”等反动组织，在后方进行间谍破坏活动。农民是供给抗战人力物力的主要源泉。大部分的人民军是拿枪的农民，农民以生产来养活部队，参加民工队给部队运输弹药。农民是抗战的主要力量，他们的生活本来应当得到改善，但事实上却仍然过着穷苦的生活，原因是封建地主阶级的土地所有制仍然存在，地主阶级还统治着农村，还继续残酷地剥削和压迫着农民。
    抗战越发展，地主阶级就越加暴露了它与帝国主义紧密勾结反对抗战的反动面目。抗战越发展越需要动员更多的人力和物力，因此更感到必须解放农村的巨大的生产力和抗战的力量。实行土地改革以消灭地主阶级、废除封建地主阶级的土地所有制、实现“耕者有其田”，这不仅成了越南人民民主革命的基本要求，而且已成为目前抗战的最迫切的要求。
    根据上述的实际情形，胡志明主席和越南劳动党中央决定在抗战中进行土地改革，以加强抗战的力量。一九五三年春，胡主席亲自签署了发动群众贯彻减租政策的法令。一九五四年一月，越南政府和国民大会颁布了废除几千年来越南的封建地主土地所有制的历史性的法令，在解放区里开始实行土地改革，实现“耕者有其田”。
    越南的土地改革与各人民民主国家土地改革基本上是相同的，它都是以废除封建地主阶级的土地所有制、实现“耕者有其田”、解放农村的生产力、发展国民经济、为人民民主制度的发展创造条件为其目的。但是越南的土地改革是在抗战的环境中进行的，所以在政策和方法方面有些地方不尽相同。
    越南劳动党和越南政府在农村中的总路线是：“依靠贫雇农，团结中农，联合富农，打倒地主阶级，有步骤地、有分别地消灭封建剥削制度，发展农业生产，有力地推进抗战。”
    因为越南的土地改革是在抗战中进行的，它必须集中一切力量来打击最主要的敌人——帝国主义侵略者，所以农民的斗争必须要进行得快、好、有秩序。要达到这个目的，必须彻底分化和孤立地主阶级，因此对于地主阶级可以根据其政治态度而分别处理。在经济方面，实施四种办法来废除地主的封建土地所有制：“没收地主、越奸、反动分子和土豪劣绅的土地及财产”；“征购民主人士、参加抗战的地主和一般地主的土地”；“征收公地和半公半私的土地”；“征收和征购宗教团体的土地”。虽然各种地主要分别对待，但最终的目的仍然是彻底废除封建地主的土地所有制，以满足农民——主要是贫雇农——的经济要求。
    由于土地改革是在抗战中进行的，为了彻底孤立地主阶级，所以提出了联合富农这个问题。一般说来，富农的封建剥削在越南是不太严重的。富农出租的土地只占富农所有土地的百分之十八至百分之二十，并且富农一般都参加了抗战、赞成反对帝国主义和封建主义，所以在政治上联合他们，在经济上保存他们，只有在富农出租的土地超过其自耕的土地一倍时才征购其出租的土地。
    越南劳动党和人民政府的适合于越南实际情况的正确的路线，已把广大的农民发动起来向地主阶级进行斗争，并获得了各阶层人民的积极拥护。因而发动群众的工作得到了顺利的开展。
    从一九五三年一月到今天为止，减租运动在越北联区、第三联区和第四联区已从九个乡扩大到拥有三百五十万人口的八百二十六个乡。一九五四年一月，在太原省六个乡里进行了土地改革第一阶段的试验，取得了重大的成就。目前，土地改革运动已在太原、清化两省扩大到了五十三个乡。
    减租运动和土地改革正继续在越南开展着，并已取得了初步的胜利。它已改变了一部分越南农村的面貌，使之焕然一新，对最近在抗战各方面所取得的胜利起了很大的作用，并为越南人民走向新的胜利创造了更多的条件。
    在经济方面，经过四次的减租运动，初步削弱了地主阶级的经济力量，部分地满足了劳动农民的经济要求。仅在越北联区九个省的四次减租运动中，就没收了越奸、反动分子和土豪劣绅的一万四千二百一十一亩土地、二千六百五十头耕牛，强迫地主退租一万二千二百六十二吨谷子，分给了拥有三十四万五千六百八十五口人的一十七万七千四百七十九户家庭。在太原省六个试点乡的土地改革中也没收、征收、征购了地主阶级的二千六百零九亩六抄〔注三〕十二尺土地、三百五十二头耕牛、一千零六十二把犁耙和其他农具及二十六吨四十七斤谷子，分给了少地和无地的农民。百分之五十六点二的人口分得了土地和胜利果实。平均每一个贫农分得五抄六尺土地，每一个雇农分得五抄土地，平均每年每一口人可以收获到二百八十斤谷子，杂粮尚未计算在内。在以前，土地是地主阶级用来剥削农民的工具，但今天它已成了农民幸福的源泉。几千年来压在越南农民头上的封建地主的土地所有制被永远地废除了。
    在政治方面，地主阶级的政治势力在减租运动中被初步打垮了。农民在六百个乡里揭穿了一万零一百四十七个地主的罪行，百分之十二的恶霸地主遭到了农民的斗争，他们都不得不俯首认罪，偿还农民的血债。百分之一点三的罪大极恶的地主被人民法庭判处死刑，百分之十二的地主被判处劳动改造。虽然如此，地主阶级在农村的残余势力还仍然存在着，所以在后来的减租运动中，他们仍然积极地进行反对农民、分散财产、收买干部、威胁骨干分子、禁闭农民等等的活动，同时派遣他们的走狗潜入乡里的领导机关，直接控制农村。
    在六个试点乡里所进行的土地改革，完全打垮了地主阶级的威风，发动群众的运动得到了进一步的深入，六十名漏网的地主被发现了，其中有十五名是越奸和土豪劣绅。所有六个乡的地主都必须到人民面前报告他们发财致富的历史，并向人民低头认罪，其中百分之八对农民犯有严重罪行的地主被判处死刑。
    土地改革运动所产生的一个巨大的政治成就是整顿了党、政府和各人民团体在农村的基层组织，把混入并控制农村党、政府和各人民团体组织中的地主及其走狗清洗出去，纯洁了农村中的基层组织，进一步巩固和发展了土地改革的胜利。农村中的党支部把一切剥削分子都清洗出去，并在贫雇农中吸收了大批的积极分子。贫雇农党员在农村党支部中以前只占百分之十五，现已达到百分之六十，这使得党支部纯洁起来，加强了战斗力，并成为在农村中强大的政治领导核心。在减租运动之后，农会会员约占农民人口的百分之二十七，而在经过土地改革的乡里，农会会员发展到占农村人口的百分之四十左右，这使得农村中的民族统一战线得到了扩大和巩固。各种青年和妇女的组织已在这坚强的阶级基础上建立起来。各种乡政权机关都掌握在贫雇农中最好的骨干手中。地主阶级的统治被打垮了，劳动农民已成了今天农村的主人。
    在思想方面，农民的阶级觉悟大大地提高了，几乎全部的贫雇中农都参加了诉苦大会，地主阶级的一切罪行都被揭露出来了。各阶层的人民都清楚地看到了地主阶级的反动面目，所以更积极地拥护农民的斗争。农民和各阶层的人民一样，都认识到了互相紧密勾结着的地主阶级和帝国主义是越南人民的两大敌人。今天，一种新的思想意识统治着农村，“坐享其成”的地主阶级不再是使人敬畏、害怕的阶级了。经过土地改革之后，独立乡的农会组长丁同志曾说过：“今天的地主好像一只疯狗似的，人人都想打它。至于谈到我，我现在才真正想活下去，因为我以前讲话没有谁愿意听，走路不敢抬起头来。今天由于有了胡主席和党的领导，我们农民才算站了起来”。
    农民更加感到胡主席和劳动党是自己的救星，更加体会到人民政权是真正为人民的利益服务的。农民在分得了土地之后，都展开了学习文化的运动，他们常常这样说：“我们今天之所以能得到温饱、能学习文化，这些都是胡伯伯给我们带来的幸福生活，因此我们必须坚决保卫它”。农民们积极地执行了党和政府的一切政策。在农民已经发动起来的乡里，他们踊跃地参加军队和民工队，参加的人数都超过了需要的人数，不得不经过评议之后把一些人留下来。太原省的农民在进行土地改革中提前一月超额百分之一百三十五完成了缴纳一九五四年度夏季的暂收农业税，出动了三百多万个工到前线服务，并保证超额完成生产计划的百分之二。农民分得土地以后都积极进行生产，他们说：“以前是为地主而工作，今天是为自己而工作”。在劳动党的领导下，他们正走上了组织起来发展生产的道路。富寿省二十三个乡的农民在减租运动之后就增加了四百一十三个变工队，挖了九百八十三条小渠，多灌溉了四千九百零八亩土地，增加了百分之五十的生产量。
    农民的力量在发动起来之后，大大地加强了抗战的工作，特别是加强了部队的战斗精神。奠边府的战士们在听到了第一阶段的土地改革试点工作获得了胜利的消息时，他们都纷纷写决心书：
  “为了世界和平，为了祖国的独立，为了农民和我们家里的土地，我们决心彻底地消灭侵略军”。
    越南的土地改革运动正在扩大中，并已取得了初步的胜利，它为今后取得更多更大的胜利开辟了道路。这个胜利是在胡主席、越南劳动党和人民政府的正确领导及越南农民对地主阶级的深恶痛绝、并在全体人民的同情和拥护之下取得的。
    中国土地改革运动的巨大影响，也是这个胜利的因素之一。中国数亿农民在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下所进行的翻天覆地的斗争，大大地鼓舞了越南农民的斗争精神。影片“白毛女”获得了越南各地农民的欢迎，看完这部影片之后，农民们都说：“天下乌鸦一般黑，哪儿的地主都是罪恶多端”。两国人民对于地主阶级的共同仇恨，更加强了中越两国人民之间的友谊。越南农民常常说：“为了要跟苏联、中国和各人民民主国家的人民一样能生活在社会主义制度的美好幸福的生活里，我们必须要进行坚决的斗争”。减租运动和土地改革在越南解放区的胜利，在各阶层人民中——特别是在敌占区的农民中和伪军中——起了巨大的影响。帝国主义及其傀儡为了降低这种影响和欺骗人民，自一九五二年起也提出了一个所谓“田地”的政策，其内容仍然是保卫地主阶级的利益，没收参加抗战的干部的土地，分给他们的走狗。几年以来，他们没有而且也不可能实行什么对农民有益的措施。农民凭切身的经验，日益认识到只有像越南民主共和国这样一个政府，才能够有力量和真正地为农民的利益在农村中进行规模巨大的、彻底的改革。
    今天，在印度支那已重新建立了和平。越南人民更有条件和更必须加强土地改革。因为土地改革的成功，将为越南人民重建被战争破坏的祖国创造条件，并将使全国人民更加信任由胡主席领导的民主共和国政府，因而更积极地为祖国的统一而斗争。土地改革的成功，将充分发挥越南人民在各方面的潜在力量；为越南人民在保卫和平、实现统一、完成独立和民主的斗争中提供了胜利的保证。它将完全改变越南农村和越南社会的面貌，沿着人民民主和社会主义大家庭中各兄弟国家所走的人民民主革命的道路大踏步前进。
