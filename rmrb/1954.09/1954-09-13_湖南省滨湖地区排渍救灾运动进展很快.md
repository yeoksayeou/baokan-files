The flood drainage and production self-salvation movement in the disaster-stricken areas of Dongting Lake in Hunan is progressing rapidly. More than 1.2 million mu of late rice, sweet potatoes, and ratooning rice have been replanted, with late rice accounting for about 80%. According to statistics from eight counties including Nanxian and Huarong, more than one million laborers have participated in flood drainage, draining more than 310,000 mu of flooded fields, releasing or withdrawing water from 620,000 mu of flooded land, transferring to non-disaster areas to borrow land for production on about 300,000 mu, opening up more than 60,000 mu of wasteland, and applying fertilizer to 110,000 mu of early and mid-season rice fields. Due to climatic reasons this year, the autumn planting season has been slightly delayed, and the flood drainage and replanting work in the lakeside area is still in full swing. Areas where crops have already been replanted are being fertilized. In Nanxian County's first district, more than 7,100 mu of the 11,200 mu of late rice have already been weeded once. The masses in Beifengshan Township, Yiyang, are also applying lime and weeding in the fields where late rice is being replanted, striving for a bumper harvest of the replanted crops.

    湖南省滨湖地区排渍救灾运动进展很快
    湖南洞庭湖滨受灾地区，排渍抢种生产自救运动进展很快，已经复种晚稻、红薯及蓄再生稻等作物一百二十多万亩，其中晚稻约占百分之八十。据南县、华容等八个县的统计，参加排渍的劳动力达百万人以上，排除渍水田三十一万多亩，放出或退出渍水的田地六十二万亩，转移到非灾区借田地生产约三十多万亩，开出荒地六万多亩，早、中稻田里赶秋十一万多亩。今年因气候关系，秋种季节稍推迟，滨湖区排渍抢种工作仍在继续紧张进行。已经复种作物的地区，正进行加工施肥。南县一区一万一千二百亩晚稻，已踩草一道的有七千一百多亩。益阳北峰山乡群众，也正在抢种晚稻的田里打石灰、扯草，争取抢种下的作物得到丰收。
