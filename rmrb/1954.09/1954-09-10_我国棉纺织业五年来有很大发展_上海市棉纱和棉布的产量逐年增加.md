Xinhua News Agency, September 9th: China's cotton textile industry has greatly developed in the past five years. By the end of this year, the total number of spindles put into production will increase by 22.3 percent compared with the total number of spindles that could be produced nationwide at the time of liberation. The number of looms (excluding cotton weaving factories and dyeing factories) will increase by 26.5 percent. The increase in textiles far exceeds the increase in equipment. This year, the planned national output of cotton yarn from machine textile enterprises will increase by more than 500.1 million kilograms compared to the actual output in 1949, and cotton cloth will increase by more than 100.5 million bolts. The increased cotton cloth alone is enough to supply more than 600 million people with a set of clothes each. If the planned output of yarn and cloth this year is compared with the highest annual output before China's liberation, cotton yarn will increase by nearly one time, and cotton cloth will increase by nearly two times.

    In the second year after the national liberation, China began to develop the cotton textile industry in a planned way, building new cotton textile factories in the cotton-producing areas of the Guanzhong Plain and Henan, Hebei, Hunan, Jiangxi and other provinces. Up to now, thirteen newly built state-owned and local state-owned cotton textile factories, such as the Beijing First Cotton Textile Factory, the Shijiazhuang First Cotton Textile Factory, the Northwest Second and Third Cotton Textile Factories, and the Wuhan First Cotton Textile Factory, have been put into production. This year, the amount of capital construction work in the state-owned cotton textile industry has more than doubled compared to last year. The four new state-owned cotton textile factories built in Beijing, Shijiazhuang, Zhengzhou, and the Northwest are larger in scale and have newer equipment. Each factory can produce enough cloth in one year to provide more than 15 million people with a new set of clothes. The establishment of these new factories has greatly accelerated the development of China's cotton textile industry.

    While building new factories, China has also made full use of existing textile equipment. Since 1951, state-owned, joint state-private, and some private cotton textile factories across the country have successively changed from a two-shift production system to a three-shift production system. Up to now, about 95 percent of the spindles nationwide have implemented three-shift production, which is equivalent to adding a lot of new equipment. More than 500,000 workers in China's cotton textile industry have actively improved technology and increased labor productivity, thus producing more with the same equipment. The number of kilograms of cotton yarn produced per hour by every thousand spindles in state-owned cotton textile factories was only 20.7 kilograms before liberation, but has increased to 27.81 kilograms in the first half of this year; the output per hour per loom was only 3.366 meters before liberation, but has increased to 4.526 meters in the first half of this year. Due to the utilization of equipment capacity and the improvement of workers' labor productivity, the production of China's original cotton textile enterprises has greatly developed. Taking the private cotton textile industry as an example, in 1949, private cotton textile factories nationwide only produced 842,000 bales of cotton yarn. Although 20 percent of private spindles were transformed into state-owned or joint state-private from 1949 to 1953, private factories produced 1.272 million bales of cotton yarn in 1953. This year, some spindles in private cotton textile factories continue to be transformed into joint state-private, but the planned output of cotton yarn in private factories this year has reached more than 1.34 million bales, an increase of more than 50 percent compared to 1949.

    Chinese textile workers actively save raw cotton in production, thus being able to produce more products with the same amount of cotton. In 1949, it took more than 410 jin of cotton to produce one bale of cotton yarn, but this year it takes an average of only more than 390 jin of cotton to spin one bale of cotton yarn.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 9th: Since the liberation of Shanghai, the People's Government has set about restoring Shanghai's textile industry. In recent years, in order to meet the needs of the people throughout the country, the People's Government has transferred a large amount of cotton from various cotton-producing areas to support Shanghai's textile industry. With the support of the People's Government in various aspects, the output of yarn and cloth in Shanghai's textile industry has grown rapidly. In the four years from 1950 to 1953, Shanghai's textile industry increased its production of cotton yarn by an average of 160,000 bales and cotton cloth by 7 million bolts per year. The estimated output of cotton cloth in 1954 will increase by 8.29 percent compared with 1953, which is about 2.3 times the output in 1950, and more than one-third more than the highest annual output before the War of Resistance Against Japan. In 1953, the cloth produced in Shanghai, only supplied to various places through the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation, could supply 327 million people with a single set of clothes each. According to statistics for the first three quarters of this year, the amount of cloth transported to areas outside Shanghai has increased by several million bolts compared to the same period last year.

    While promoting increased production, the People's Government has also continuously encouraged and helped various textile and printing and dyeing factories in Shanghai to actively improve varieties, colors, and patterns, improve the quality of cotton cloth, and produce more high-quality cloth that consumers love. In 1953, the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation and the East China Textile Administration jointly organized a printed cloth evaluation agency, and began to encourage designers to create new printed cloth patterns with national characteristics in a planned way, gradually eliminating those old patterns with ugly images and dim colors. The printed cloth selected and printed through the evaluation has been welcomed by the majority of consumers. With the gradual improvement of the living standards of the people throughout the country, many factories have gradually improved spindles and looms, increased the production of fine cotton cloth, and the sales volume of good cloth has also continued to increase. The Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation will supply more than three times as much indanthrene cloth with good color and firm texture to various places this year than in 1951, nearly two times more khaki drill and venetian cloth, nearly four and a half times more various dark-colored printed cloth, and twenty-three and a half times more various light-colored printed cloth. Shanghai's textile industry can now mass-produce high-quality textiles such as khaki, gabardine, corduroy, seersucker, Hong Kong lawn, Shanghai lawn, and railway velvet, which were rarely produced or could not be produced before liberation.

    Shanghai is China's old textile industrial base. After liberation, the People's Government led Shanghai's textile industry to quickly restore production, and then launched workers in state-owned textile factories to carry out democratic reforms and production reforms, and launched an increase production and practice economy campaign. Labor productivity has continued to increase, and the output of cotton yarn and cotton cloth has increased year by year. If the cotton cloth output of Shanghai's state-owned cotton textile industry in 1950 is compared to 100, it increased to 120.41 in 1951, 164.39 in 1952, and 184.23 in 1953. For the vast private cotton textile industry, the People's Government adopted measures such as exchanging cotton for yarn and organizing processing shortly after the liberation of Shanghai to help them solve the problem of raw material sources and maintain and restore production. In 1951, the People's Government implemented unified purchase and sale for the private cotton textile industry, and then gradually expanded the proportion of processing, so that private cotton textile factories would not worry about the source of raw materials and product sales, and could concentrate their efforts on improving production. The scope and proportion of processing, purchasing, and exclusive sales of cotton cloth have also been expanded year by year. In the second half of 1952, democratic reforms were carried out in various private cotton textile factories, unreasonable systems were abolished, and an increase production and practice economy campaign was gradually launched. With the progress of these tasks, the production of the city's private cotton textile industry has also increased year by year.

    我国棉纺织业五年来有很大发展
    上海市棉纱和棉布的产量逐年增加
    【新华社九日讯】我国棉纺织工业五年来已有很大发展。到今年年底为止投入生产的纱锭总数，将比全国解放时所有能够生产的纱锭总数增加百分之二十二点三，织布机（不包括棉织厂和染织厂的）将增加百分之二十六点五。纺织品增加的比例更大大超过设备增长的比例。今年全国机器纺织企业的棉纱计划产量比一九四九年的实际产量增加五亿零一百多万公斤，棉布增加一亿零五十多万匹。仅仅增加的这些棉布就可以供应六亿多人每人做一套衣服。今年的纱布计划产量如和我国解放前最高年产量比较，棉纱增加近一倍，棉布增加两倍弱。
    在全国解放后的第二年，我国就开始有计划地发展棉纺织工业，在关中平原和河南、河北、湖南、江西等省的产棉区建设新的棉纺织厂。到目前为止，已有国营北京第一棉纺织厂、国营石家庄第一棉纺织厂、国营西北第二、第三棉纺织厂、国营武汉第一棉纺织厂等十三个新建的国营和地方国营棉纺织厂投入生产了。今年国营棉纺织业的基本建设工作量又比去年增加一倍多，在北京、石家庄、郑州和西北新建的四个国营棉纺织厂，规模更大，设备更新，每个厂一年生产的布就可以供给一千五百多万人各做一套新衣。这些新厂的建立，大大加快了我国棉纺织工业发展的速度。
    和建设新厂的同时，我国并充分地利用了原有的纺织设备。从一九五一年起，全国公营、公私合营和一部分私营棉纺织厂先后把原来的两班生产制改为三班生产制。到目前为止，全国已有百分之九十五左右的纱锭实行三班生产，这样就等于增加了很多新的设备。我国棉纺织业中的五十多万职工积极地改进技术，提高劳动生产率，因而使同样的设备生产出了更多的东西。国营棉纺织厂中每千个锭子每小时产棉纱的数量，在解放前只有二十点七公斤，今年上半年已增加到二十七点八一公斤；每台布机每小时的产量，解放前只有三点三六六公尺，今年上半年已增加到四点五二六公尺。由于设备能力的发挥和工人劳动生产率的提高，所以我国原有棉纺织企业的生产都有很大发展。拿私营棉纺织业来说，一九四九年全国私营棉纺织厂只生产棉纱八十四万二千件，从一九四九年到一九五三年虽然有百分之二十的私营纱锭转变为国营或公私合营，但是一九五三年私营厂却生产了一百二十七万二千件棉纱。今年私营棉纺织厂中继续有一部分纱锭转变为公私合营，而私营厂今年的棉纱计划产量却达到一百三十四万多件，比一九四九年增加一半以上。
    我国纺织工人在生产中积极地节约原棉，因而能用同等数量的棉花生产更多的产品。一九四九年每生产一件棉纱要用四百一十多斤棉花，今年平均只用三百九十多斤棉花就能纺出一件棉纱了。
    【新华社上海九日电】从上海解放时起，人民政府就着手恢复上海的纺织工业。几年来，人民政府为了满足全国人民生活的需要，从国内各棉产区调运大批棉花支持上海的纺织工业。在人民政府各方面支援扶植下，上海纺织工业的纱布产量增长很快。从一九五零年到一九五三年的四年中，上海纺织工业平均每年增产棉纱十六万件，棉布七百万匹。一九五四年棉布的预计产量又比一九五三年增加百分之八点二九，约等于一九五零年产量的二点三倍，比抗战前最高年产量多三分之一以上。一九五三年内上海出产的布匹，仅通过中国花纱布公司上海采购供应站供应各地的，就可供给三亿二千七百万人每人做一套单衣服。今年前三个季度的统计，运往上海以外各地区的布匹，已比去年同期增加数百万匹。
    在促进产量增加的同时，人民政府还不断鼓励和帮助上海各纺织、印染工厂积极改进品种、花色，提高棉布质量，生产更多的为消费者喜爱的上等布匹。一九五三年，中国花纱布公司上海采购供应站和华东纺织管理局共同组织花布评选机构，开始有计划地鼓励设计人员创制富有民族风格的新花布图样，逐步淘汰那些形象丑恶、色调灰暗的旧花样。通过评选印制的花布获得广大消费者欢迎。随着全国人民生活水平的逐年提高，许多工厂逐步改进纱锭和布机，增产了质地细密的棉布，好布的销售量也不断增加。中国花纱布公司上海采购供应站今年供应各地的色泽好、质地坚的士林布，将比一九五一年增加三倍多，各色哔叽、直贡呢增加近两倍，各种深色花布增加四倍半，各种浅色花布增加二十三倍半。解放以前很少生产或不能生产的卡其、华达呢、灯芯绒、泡泡纱、香港罗、上海罗、火车绒等质地精良的纺织品，上海纺织工业现在已能大量生产。
    上海是我国旧有的纺织工业基地。解放后，人民政府领导上海纺织工业迅速恢复了生产，随即在国营纺织工厂中发动工人进行民主改革、生产改革，开展增产节约运动，劳动生产率不断提高，棉纱、棉布产量因而逐年增加。如果把上海国营棉纺织工业一九五零年的棉布产量比作一百，一九五一年就增加到一百二十点四一，一九五二年又增加到一百六十四点三九，一九五三年增加到一百八十四点二三。对广大的私营棉纺织工业，人民政府在上海解放不久就采取以棉易纱和组织加工等办法，帮助它们解决原料的来源问题，维持和恢复了生产。一九五一年，人民政府又对私营棉纺业实行统一购销，其后又逐渐扩大加工比重，使各私营棉纺厂不要愁原料来源和产品销路，能集中力量改进生产。棉布的加工、收购、包销的范围和比重也逐年扩大。一九五二年下半年，各私营棉纺织厂进行了民主改革，废除了不合理的制度，并逐渐开展了增产节约运动。随着这些工作的进展，全市私营棉纺织工业的生产也年年提高。
