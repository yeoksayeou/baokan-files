　　Large Quantities of Longan from Luzhou City Enter the Market

　　The famous special product of Sichuan Province – Luzhou City longan – is entering the market in large quantities. According to surveys, this year the suburbs of Luzhou City can produce over one million jin of fresh longan, more than five times the output of last year. This year, the state-owned farm orchards in Luzhou City can produce about 120,000 jin of longan from over 2,000 longan trees. Currently, the Luzhou City Cooperative Union has signed contracts with farmers in various townships to purchase longan and is carrying out the purchasing work. The Sichuan Provincial Cooperative Union has also signed a contract with the Luzhou City Cooperative Union. Besides supplying some fresh longan to major cities along the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the remainder will be dried and transported to Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and the Northeast, and some will also be exported to countries such as Burma.

　　This year, the Luzhou City Local State-Owned No. 1 Winery successfully brewed liquor using longan pits during the technical innovation movement, with four jin of pits yielding one jin of liquor. The Luzhou City Company of the China Monopoly Corporation has signed a contract with the Luzhou City Cooperative Union to purchase a large quantity of longan pits for liquor brewing, in order to save red grain for the state.

    泸州市桂圆大量上市
    四川省著名的特产——泸州市桂圆大量上市。据调查，今年泸州市郊区可出产生桂圆一百多万斤，比去年的产量多五倍以上。泸州市国营农场果园今年两千多株桂圆树可产桂圆十二万斤左右。现在，泸州市合作社联合社已经和各乡农民订了收购桂圆的合同，展开收购工作。四川省合作社联合社也和泸州市合作社联合社订好合同，除了供应成渝铁路沿线大城市一部分生桂圆外，其余将炕干，运销北京、天津、上海和东北等地，有的还将出口，运往缅甸等国家。
    泸州市地方国营第一酒厂今年在技术革新运动中，用桂圆核酿酒成功，四斤核可酿酒一斤。中国专卖事业公司泸州市公司已经和泸州市合作社联合社订了合同，大量收购桂圆核酿酒，以便为国家节省红粮。（曾泽英）
