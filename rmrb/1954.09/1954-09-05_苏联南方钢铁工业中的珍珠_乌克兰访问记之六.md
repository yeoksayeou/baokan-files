    Pearl of the Southern Soviet Steel Industry
    ——Visit to Ukraine VI
    By Our Correspondent Li He

    People say that the "Zaporozhstal" plant is the pearl of the Southern Soviet steel industry. Anyone who steps into this giant factory will unconditionally agree with this assessment.

    The "Zaporozhstal" plant and the chimneys of various metallurgical enterprises in Zaporozhye spew thick smoke, which we saw from afar on the Dnieper River. This scene is the same as what we saw when the ship passed through Dnepropetrovsk and Dneprodzerzhinsk upstream of Zaporozhye. It is no accident that many steel factories are built along the Dnieper River. The steppe areas on both sides of the Dnieper River have Ukraine's two richest treasures: the Donbas coal mining area in the east and the Krivbas iron ore area in the west, and they are only 400 kilometers apart. In addition to coal, Donbas also produces refractory clay and limestone, while Krivbas produces manganese in addition to iron. Iron, coal, manganese, limestone, and refractory clay—the convergence of these raw materials creates excellent conditions for the development of the steel industry.

    The "Zaporozhstal" plant is a product of the Soviet Union's first five-year plan. Nikolai Petrovich Moiseenko, the deputy director of the steel plant, has been through the entire history of the factory. According to him, the site where the factory is located was still an open space in 1928, and wolves could be heard howling at night. With the establishment of many enterprises, the urban population also prospered. The factory first produced pig iron on November 22, 1933. In 1941, when the fascist invading army approached Zaporozhye, the workers used the darkness to move all the machines to the rear. In October 1943, the Soviet army liberated Zaporozhye. Before leaving, the enemy destroyed the factory to the point of being irreparable. At that time, both Germans and Americans believed that the factory could not be restored. The Americans thought that the Soviet Union would have to rely on the United States to supply thin steel plates. In April 1947, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union decided to restore the factory. Forty thousand people participated in the reconstruction work. They came from all over the Soviet Union, including various ethnic groups. They completed the Party's task in half a year under difficult living conditions. The factory started production again in October of that year. While restoring the factory, the city was also restored. 200,000 square meters of housing were built, as well as schools, hospitals, kindergartens, clubs, sports fields, parks, etc.

  The "Zaporozhstal" plant was regenerated precisely under the spirit of patriotism of the Soviet people that there is nothing that cannot be done.

    All the thin steel plates used in cars and tractors produced in the Soviet Union are supplied by the "Zaporozhstal" plant. This shows the important position of this factory in the Soviet national economy.

    There are a total of forty-eight workshops in the entire factory. We chose to visit the blast furnace, open hearth furnace, rolling mill, hot-rolled sheet, cold-rolled, and tinplate workshops in two days. Each workshop is actually a factory.

    Where the rails are lined up, there are five huge blast furnaces. This is the blast furnace workshop. One of them is under repair, and the other four are working. Cable cars are busy transporting iron ore, limestone, and coke to the blast furnace. The steel cables do not need to be stopped when they are replaced. The iron ore comes from Krivbas and contains about 54% iron. It is sintered into blocks in the sintering workshop to increase the iron content to 70%. Recently, it is planned to sinter limestone and iron ore at the same time to make the mixture more uniform so that the blast furnace can work better.

    Before the war, only three blast furnaces were working. The fourth "Komsomol" blast furnace had been repaired but not yet used and was completely destroyed by the fascist invaders when they fled. After the war, not only were the four blast furnaces repaired, but a fifth one was also added. The "Komsomol" blast furnace was rebuilt in only one hundred and five days. The entire furnace was welded by electric welding, thus avoiding 200,000 holes and 50,000 rivets. In addition, it was built on the ground using high-speed assembly line operations and then assembled, so the construction was so fast that it broke the world record. The No. 3, 4, and 5 blast furnaces each have a volume of 1,350 cubic meters, and each furnace has produced 1,975 tons of pig iron per day and night.

    The blast furnace equipment is automated. The automatic instruments of the "Komsomol" blast furnace indicate the amount and pressure of air consumption, the amount of water consumption, the temperature of the furnace, the level of the material, and the amount of gas consumption. Opening the furnace, sealing the furnace, and pouring out the molten iron are all mechanized, without the need for many people, which is both labor-saving and safe. When we visited, each furnace was constantly producing pig iron. The molten iron was poured into iron-filled buckets. Some of the iron-filled buckets poured the molten iron onto a conveyor belt of ladle-shaped molds. This conveyor belt rotates evenly, passes through the cooling device, and tilts the pig iron ingots solidified on the molds into the carriages below. The other buckets full of molten iron are sent to the large mixing furnace along the rails to be mixed evenly, and then put into the open hearth furnace for smelting.

    In the tall and spacious workshop, ten open hearth furnaces are smelting steel. The energy of the furnace for steelmaking is 185 tons. The feeding machine moving in front of the open hearth furnace constantly puts the material into the furnace. Workers can observe the temperature of the furnace roof, the air pressure inside the furnace, the temperature of the regenerator, the ratio of combustion gas to air mixture, the amount of air and gas consumption, etc. from the automatic instrument room opposite the furnace. Workers can drink salted soda at any time in the workshop. In order to ensure that workers are not cold in winter, corridors have been added from the workplace to the workshop office and dining room. The originally heavy steelmaking labor has become much easier.

    It happened that a furnace of steel was made. The scorching white molten steel flowed through the curved groove of the furnace mouth into the steel-filled bucket. The workshop director, Leskov, said that about 2,500 furnaces of steel were quickly smelted in the first half of the year. Many open hearth furnaces produce four furnaces of steel per day and night. In 1950, each square meter of furnace bottom produced 5 tons of steel, and now it has increased to an average of 7.7 tons. During the three and a half years, the labor productivity of the workshop has increased by 54.7%. This is due to the improvement of production organization and the adoption of new technologies.

    "Of course, the workers know that more steel production will lead to an earlier entry into a communist society," Leskov said with a smile. He has learned about 300 Chinese characters from Chinese comrades who have interned in the workshop. In the blast furnace and open hearth furnace workshops, we met Chinese students interning. Leskov cordially introduced the progress of the workshop: strengthened the quick smelting process; used magnesia-chrome bricks as the furnace roof, which does not need to be repaired within half a year, increasing production by 15%; used forsterite for regenerator checker bricks, extending the working period from two months to one year; increased the number of feeding machines; saved iron-manganese mixture, etc.

    In this workshop where pig iron is smelted into steel, many workers and foremen have been rapidly improved in work and study. Many workers have become technicians, and foremen have become engineers. Many workers are studying at the two-year foreman school. Young engineers and technicians such as Xue Lieznev, Liakh, Shepulyakov, Gontcharov, etc., have been promoted to foremen, and their work is no less than that of masters with 20 to 30 years of metallurgical experience. Xue Lieznev was still a child during the Patriotic War, serving as a scout for the guerrillas and participating in the work of blowing up enemy trains. Now he has graduated from a secondary technical school and become an excellent foreman.

    This workshop is the birthplace of the joint competition among steelworkers in the production sections that are adjacent to each other, and the high-speed steelmaking competition. This competition was initiated two years ago by Yachimenko, a Communist Party member and steelworker from the No. 10 open hearth furnace, and Martdinov and Nieperizeng, and later spread throughout the Soviet Union. It has played a major role in strengthening cooperation among workshops, sections, production teams, and work shifts, in improving the use of machinery and equipment, and in increasing steel output. These three outstanding steelworkers created a new record for steel output from a 185-ton open hearth furnace in 1952: quick smelting accounted for 84%, and each square meter of furnace bottom produced 7.31 tons of steel, which was 27,000 tons more than other open hearth furnaces. This open hearth furnace was overhauled after smelting 657 furnaces. In 1953, they achieved 7.6 tons of steel per square meter of furnace bottom. Competitors have surpassed them. Steelworkers Kosyakov of the No. 6 open hearth furnace produced 8.07 tons of steel per square meter of furnace bottom in 1953. Youth League member Pomiyadong produced 8.99 tons. Yachimenko was originally a collective farmer. Before the war, he came to the factory to visit. He liked the work of steelmaking. He started as a steelmaking assistant. During the Patriotic War, he served as the company commander of an artillery company. After the war, he became a steelworker again. He is now studying in the foreman class of the Dnepropetrovsk Steel Institute. An ordinary worker has become an outstanding figure respected by society because of his love for labor. He often helps others and welcomes newcomers to catch up with and surpass him. This is a common thing in socialist society.

    The molten steel is solidified into ingots and sent to the rolling mill workshop. Each 16-ton steel ingot is heated in a heating furnace like a large pit. The heater burns gas transported from the coking furnace and blast furnace. After heating, the steel ingot is transferred to a giant rolling mill and rolled to a thickness of 8 cm. The rolling mill and conveying device almost occupy the entire workshop. The machine is automatically operated. Even the lubricating oil used on the machine is automatically added.

    The hot-rolled sheet workshop is connected to the rolling mill workshop. The 8 cm thick hot steel billet is sent here from the rolling mill workshop and rolled thinner through the first giant rolling mill consisting of four rolling mill stands. Then, after an automatic inspector, the steel plates that meet the thickness requirements are sent to the second rolling mill consisting of six rolling mill stands to roll thinner plates. On this machine roll, what we see is not like a steel plate but like a piece of cloth. The products here are only two to six millimeters thick and seventy to one hundred and twenty meters long. Like the blast furnace, open hearth furnace, and rolling mill workshops, we saw very few workers in the hot-rolled sheet workshop. The two rolling mills, with a total of ten rolling mill stands, are only watched by ten to twelve people. Those who watch these automatically operated machines are workers with higher technical skills and better work attitudes. The labor productivity of this workshop increased by 93% in 1953 compared with 1941.

    Part of the hot-rolled sheet is sent to the cold-rolled workshop, and part is sent to the tinplate workshop in coils. These workshops are adjacent to each other. Thin plates that have not been cold-rolled will leave marks even if a hair is pressed on them, so they are first pickled with acid. The pickling tank is about forty to fifty meters long. The pickled thin plates are gray. Then it is placed on a rolling mill for rolling again. In this way, the thin plate is stronger, thinner, and brighter. In the second quarter of the All-Soviet competition, the cold-rolling workshop won the honorary title of "Excellent Rolling Workshop of the Soviet Steel Industry". The Gusenitsa rolling team over-rolled 250 tons of thin plates in the first twelve days of August. All the workers in the workshop guaranteed to over-roll 8,000 tons of thin plates by the end of the year.

    Rolling wide thin plates is not easy. The factory did not know how to roll them before the war. Therefore, the automobile factory had to weld two narrow thin plates together. After collective research by engineers after the war, the factory has been able to roll wide thin plates. One thin plate is enough for the roof of a "Victory" car.

    In the hot-rolled sheet and cold-rolled workshops, we saw bundles and piles of thin plates waiting to be transported to the people's democratic countries. Many of them are waiting to be transported to our country. One bundle of thin plates was printed with the words "to be shipped to Tianjin." The workers in the workshop said, "We seriously complete China's orders and never delay."

    In the tinplate workshop, many small rolling mills are rolling paper-like iron sheets. After being rolled, they are hot-dip galvanized, bundled into rolls, and sent to canneries all over the country. The electroplating furnace has been installed and will soon be electroplated. The tinplate rolled here is as long as 100 meters, and 90% can be used to make canned food. This workshop produces a surprising amount of tinplate. This is precisely the support of heavy industrial enterprises for the consumer goods industry in response to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

    The "Zaporozhstal" plant increases the production of steel year by year. The current output is about twice that before the war. All employees of the factory are selflessly engaged in a competition to further improve labor productivity. They guarantee that in 1954, labor productivity will be increased by 12% compared with 1953, waste loss will be reduced by 35%, and the state will be given an extra 5 million rubles from reducing product costs above the plan. The factory's Party organization strives to concretize and make the competition effective.

    The factory's Party committee inspected the trade union's leadership of the socialist competition and helped it overcome such shortcomings of formalism and bureaucracy, such as allowing certain workshops or workers to set low production quotas and not absorbing a large number of employees to participate in summarizing the competition, etc. The Party organization paid special attention to continuing to promote the joint competition of steelworkers initiated by Yachimenko and others. Inter-workshop production meetings are very helpful for the development of the competition and are valued. Those who participate in the inter-workshop production meetings include not only the workshops that are adjacent to each other, but also personnel from the factory management department, laboratory, and technical inspection office. There are now more than 800 production teams, sections, and work shifts in the factory participating in the joint competition. It has developed the spirit of collectivism and mutual assistance among employees.

    Newspapers and periodicals are also powerful weapons used by the factory's Party organization to mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses of employees for production. We visited the "Dnieper Steelworker," the organ of the factory's Party, trade union, and management department. This letterpress newspaper is published twice a week, with a circulation of 3,000 copies per issue. The editor-in-chief is an engineer. The newspaper has a high reputation among employees. Wall newspapers and satirical cartoons can be seen in various workshops. There are more than 100 kinds of wall newspapers and satirical cartoons in the entire factory. They are short, concise, and militant. The wall newspaper "For Steel" published by the open hearth furnace workshop is edited by a technician. "For Steel" sharply criticizes those who violate labor discipline and technical discipline. The workshop also publishes a satirical cartoon "Hornet," which publishes thought-provoking critical cartoons. One painting showed a worker reaching the record of smelting 657 furnaces of steel, then lying on the rising line, breaking the line, and the complacent person fell badly. After seeing the cartoon, the worker overcame complacency and his work greatly improved.

    苏联南方钢铁工业中的珍珠
    ——乌克兰访问记之六
    本报记者　李何
    人们说：“札坡罗什钢铁”厂是苏联南方钢铁工业中的珍珠。走进这座巨型工厂的人，会无条件地赞同这句评语。
    “札坡罗什钢铁”厂和札坡罗什各冶金企业林立的烟突喷吐着浓烟，我们从第聂伯河的轮船上远远就看见了。这个景象和在札坡罗什上游轮船经过第聂伯彼得罗夫斯克和第聂伯捷尔津斯克时所见相同。许多钢铁工厂建立在第聂伯河沿岸不是偶然的。在第聂伯河两岸的草原地带有乌克兰两个最富的宝藏：东面是顿巴斯煤矿区，西面是克里沃巴斯铁矿区，而它们相距不过四百公里。在顿巴斯除了煤还出耐火泥和石灰石，克里沃巴斯除了铁还出锰。铁、煤、锰、石灰石、耐火泥，——这些原料汇合在一起，便造成钢铁工业发展的优越条件。
    “札坡罗什钢铁”厂是苏联第一个五年计划的产儿。钢铁厂的副厂长尼古莱·彼特罗维奇·摩伊铣科，经过工厂的全部历程。据他谈：工厂所在的地方，在一九二八年还是一片空地，晚上听到狼叫。随着许多企业的成立，城市人口也兴旺起来。工厂在一九三三年十一月二十二日第一次出产生铁。一九四一年法西斯侵略军迫近札坡罗什时，工人们利用黑夜把全部机器都迁移到后方去。一九四三年十月苏军解放了札坡罗什。敌人临走时把工厂炸毁到难以恢复的程度。当时德国人、美国人都认为工厂恢复不成了。美国人想这下子苏联要依赖美国供给薄钢板了。一九四七年四月苏联共产党中央决定恢复这个工厂。有四万人参加重建的工作。他们来自全苏联各地，包括各个民族。他们在居住和生活条件很困难的情形下半年内就完成了党的任务。当年十月工厂又开始生产了。在恢复工厂的同时，恢复了城市。建造了二十万平方公尺的住宅，以及学校、医院、幼儿园、俱乐部、运动场、公园等等。
  “札坡罗什钢铁”厂正是在苏联人民这种没有什么做不到的爱国主义的精神下再生的。
    苏联出产的所有汽车和拖拉机上用的薄钢板，都是由“札坡罗什钢铁”厂供给的。从这可以看出这个工厂在苏联国民经济中所占的重要地位。
    全厂总共有四十八个车间。我们两天选看了高炉、平炉、轧钢、热轧薄板、冷轧、马口铁六个车间。每个车间其实都是一座工厂。
    在铁轨纵列的地方，矗立着五座巨大的高炉。这是高炉车间。其中一座在修理，其他四座都在工作。钢缆车忙碌地把铁矿、石灰石、焦炭运上高炉去。钢缆更换时不用停车。铁矿是从克里沃巴斯来的，含铁百分之五十四左右，经过烧结车间烧结成块，把铁的成分提高到百分之七十。最近计划把石灰石和铁矿同时烧结，使两者混合得更均匀，以便高炉更好地工作。
    在战前只有三座高炉工作，第四号“共青团”高炉，修好还没有使用，全被法西斯侵略者败走时炸毁了。战后，不但修复了四座高炉，而且添造了第五座。“共青团”号高炉重建时只花一百零五天。整个炉用电焊焊成，因而免打二十万个孔，免用五万个铆钉，加以用高速流水作业法在地上建成然后装配，所以建造之快，打破了世界纪录。第三、四、五号高炉每炉容积一千三百五十立方公尺，一炉一昼夜曾出到一千九百七十五吨生铁。
    高炉设备是自动化的。“共青团”号高炉的自动化仪器标明着空气的消耗量和压力，水的消耗量，炉的温度，料的高低，瓦斯的消耗量。开炉、封炉和倒出铁汁都是机械化的，不用几个人手，既省力又保险。当我们参观时，各炉在不断地出生铁。生铁汁泻进盛铁桶。一部分盛铁桶把生铁汁倒在一串杓形模子的输送带上。这个输送带均衡地旋转着，经过冷却装置，把模子上凝结了的生铁锭倾到下面承接着的车厢中去。另外部分盛满生铁汁的桶，沿着铁轨被送到大混铁炉那里调匀，然后放进平炉冶炼。
    在高大宽敞的车间内，十座平炉在冶炼着钢。炉子炼钢能量是一百八十五吨。高炉前移动的加料机不时把料塞进炉里。工人从炉子对面自动化仪器室可以察看炉顶温度、炉内的气压、蓄热室的温度、燃烧气体和空气混合的比例、空气和瓦斯的消耗量等等。工人在车间内随时可以喝到加盐的汽水。为了保证工人冬天不受凉，从工作场到车间的办公室和饭厅，添盖了走廊。本来沉重的炼钢劳动，变得轻松多了。
    恰巧有一炉钢炼成了。灼白的钢汁经过炉口的曲槽流进盛钢桶。车间主任列斯科夫说：上半年约二千五百炉钢是快炼的。许多平炉每昼夜出四炉钢。在一九五○年每平方公尺炉底出五吨钢，现在增加到平均七点七吨。在这三年半期间，车间的劳动生产率提高了百分之五十四点七。这是由于改进了生产组织和采用了新的技术。
    “自然，工人们知道，多产钢，就早进入共产主义社会。”列斯科夫含笑地说。他已经学会约三百个中国字，是向曾经在车间实习的中国同志学的。在高炉和平炉车间，我们都遇见了中国留学生在实习。列斯科夫亲切地介绍了车间进步的地方：强化了快炼过程；使用了镁铬砖作炉顶，半年以内不用修理，提高生产百分之十五；使用了镁橄榄石
  （Форстерит）作蓄热室格子砖，把工作期限从二个月延长到一年；增多了加料机；节省铁锰混合料等等。
    在这生铁冶炼成钢的车间，许多工人、工长在工作和学习中得到迅速提高。许多工人成为技师，工长成为工程师。许多工人在两年制的工长学校学习。年青的工程师和技师如薛列兹涅夫、里亚赫、谢甫里雅科夫、冈察罗夫等等，被提拔当工长，工作不次于有二三十年冶金经验的能手。薛列兹涅夫在卫国战争时还是小孩子，当游击队的侦察员，参加爆破敌人列车的工作，现在已经念完中等技术学校，成为优秀的工长。
    这个车间是互相毗连的生产部分的钢铁工人进行联合竞赛，进行高速炼钢竞赛的发源地。这个竞赛两年前由第十号平炉炼钢工人共产党员雅其孟科和马尔狄诺夫、涅培里增发起，后来传播到全苏联。它对于加强各车间、各工段、各生产组、各工作班的集体之间的合作，对于机器设备使用的改进，对于提高出钢量，起了重大作用。这三位优秀的炼钢工人在一九五二年创造了一百八十五吨型平炉的出钢新纪录：快炼的占百分之八十四，每平方公尺炉底出七点三一吨钢，比其他平炉多出二万七千吨。这座平炉炼了六百五十七炉才大修理。在一九五三年他们做到每平方公尺炉底出七点六吨钢。竞赛者赶过他们。第六号平炉炼钢工人科西雅科夫等在一九五三年从每平方公尺炉底出八点零七吨钢。青年团员波米雅东出八点九九吨。雅其孟科原来是集体农民，战前到工厂来参观，喜欢炼钢的工作，开始当炼钢助手，卫国战争中担任炮兵连连长，战后又当炼钢工人。他现在第聂伯彼得罗夫斯克钢铁学院的工长班学习。一个普通的工人因为爱好劳动而成为受社会尊敬的出色人物。他经常帮助别人，并欢迎后起者赶上和超过他。这在社会主义社会是常见的事。
    钢汁凝成锭，送到轧钢车间。每块重十六吨的钢锭放在大地坑似的加热炉中加热。加热器烧的是由炼焦炉和高炉输送来的瓦斯。钢锭加热后传送到巨型的轧钢机上，轧到八公分厚薄。轧钢机和传送装置几乎占满整个车间。机器是自动操纵的。连机器上用的润滑油也是自动添加的。
    薄板热轧车间和轧钢车间相衔接。八公分厚薄的热钢坯，由轧钢车间送到这里，通过第一部由四台轧板支架组成的巨大轧板机，轧得更薄了。然后经过自动检查器，薄度合格的钢板，送到第二部由六台轧板支架组成的轧薄板机上。在这个机器滚轴上，我们看到的简直不像钢板而像布匹。这里出品薄到只二到六公厘，长七十到一百二十公尺。和高炉、平炉、轧钢各车间一样，在薄板热轧车间看到很少的工人。两部轧板机，共有十台轧板支架，只用十个到十二个人看管。看管这些自动操纵的机器的，都是技术水平较高和劳动态度较好的工人。这个车间的劳动生产率在一九五三年比一九四一年增加百分之九十三。
    热轧后的薄板，一部分送到冷轧车间，一部分成卷地送到马口铁车间。这些车间彼此毗邻。未经冷轧的薄板，即使压上一根头发也会留下痕迹，所以先用酸洗净。酸洗缸约四五十公尺长。洗后的薄板呈现灰色。然后放在轧钢机上再轧。这样，薄板更坚，也更薄更光。在第二季全苏竞赛中，冷轧车间获得“苏联钢铁工业优秀的轧钢车间”的光荣称号。古先尼察轧钢组在八月份头十二天中，超额多轧了二百五十吨薄板。全车间工人保证到年底超额多轧八千吨薄板。
    轧宽薄板是不容易的。工厂在战前还不会轧。因此，汽车制造厂要把两块窄薄板焊接在一起。战后经过工程师们集体研究，工厂已经能轧宽薄板。一块薄板足够“胜利牌”汽车车顶用。
    在热轧薄板和冷轧车间，看到待运到人民民主国家的薄板成捆成堆。其中有许多是待运到我国的。有一捆薄板上面印着运往天津的字样。车间工人说：“我们认真地完成中国的订货，绝不拖延。”
    在马口铁车间，许多台小型的轧薄板机在轧制纸条似的铁皮。轧出后经过热镀，成卷地打包发送给全国各地罐头工厂。电镀炉已经装置好，不久将改用电镀。这里轧出的铁皮长达一百公尺，百分之九十可以制罐头。这个车间出产着多得惊人的马口铁。这正是重工业企业响应苏共中央的号召，对日用品工业的支援。
    “札坡罗什钢铁”厂一年比一年增加钢铁的产量。目前产量约为战前的两倍。全厂职工不自满地进行着争取进一步提高劳动生产率的竞赛。他们保证：在一九五四年比一九五三年提高劳动生产率百分之十二，减少废品损失百分之三十五，从降低产品成本中超计划多给国家五百万卢布。工厂党的组织努力使这个竞赛具体化和有成效。
    工厂党委会检查了工会对社会主义竞赛的领导，帮助它克服这类形式主义和官僚主义的缺点，如像让某些车间或工人订低了生产定额，没有吸收广大职工参加便总结竞赛等等。党的组织特别注意继续推广雅其孟科等发起的钢铁工人的联合竞赛。车间间际生产会议，对于发展竞赛很有帮助，受到重视。参加间际生产会议的，不但有互相毗连的车间，而且有工厂管理部、实验室、技术检查处的人员。现在厂内已有八百多个生产组、工段、工作班参加联合的竞赛。它在职工间发展了集体主义和互助的精神。
    报刊也是工厂党的组织用以发动职工群众生产积极性的有力武器。我们访问了工厂党、工会和管理部的机关报“第聂伯钢铁工人”。这个铅印小报每周出两次，每期发行三千份，主编是工程师出身。报纸在职工中威信很高。在各车间都看到墙报和讽刺画报。全厂有一百多种墙报和讽刺画报，它们短小精悍，富有战斗性。平炉车间出的墙报“为着钢”，编辑是个技师。“为着钢”尖锐地批评那些破坏劳动纪律和技术纪律的人。车间还出讽刺画报“黄蜂”，发表使人清醒的批评漫画。有一幅画一位工人达到炼六百五十七炉钢的纪录，便躺在上升的线上，把线压断，这位自满者跌了一大跤。这位工人看了漫画后，克服了自满情绪，工作大有改进。
