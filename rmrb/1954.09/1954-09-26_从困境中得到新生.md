    Rebirth from Adversity
    Jian Yuqie, National People's Congress Representative, Vice Chairman of the Joint State-Private Owned Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company

    I have been managing the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company for fifty years. This enterprise was founded in 1904 with investments primarily from overseas Chinese miners. Within a few years, its products were sold throughout the country. Later, as the business developed, it openly solicited shares, establishing factories in various parts of the country, deeply supported by patriotic individuals. However, the imperialists were unwilling to see the rise of our national industry, and therefore constantly used coercion and enticement to undermine us. The reactionary Kuomintang government colluded with the imperialists to intensify our oppression. There was a time when domestically produced cigarettes had to pay a tax each time they crossed a provincial border, while the products of foreign tobacco factories paid only one tax and could circulate freely throughout China. Therefore, after the First World War, except for a brief period of prosperity during the May Thirtieth Movement, "Nanyang" steadily declined. By 1936, the company's finances were stranded, and the bureaucratic capital of Song Ziwen took the opportunity to invade. From then on, "Nanyang" became an enterprise controlled by bureaucratic capital. Their business methods are well known. They had no interest in production, only in speculation. They placed their cronies within the enterprise, filling their own pockets. Coupled with years of war and the Kuomintang's corrupt politics and paralyzed economy, the enterprise was left in ruins, on its last breath.

    In 1949, the mainland of China was liberated successively. Our factories on the mainland were taken over or supervised by the local military control commissions. Subsequently, a general management office was established in Shanghai, and the enterprise was formally reorganized into a joint state-private owned enterprise. Over the past few years, with the strong support of the government and the correct leadership of the state-owned side, the enterprise has rapidly moved from recovery to development. Currently, our five factories—Shanghai, Hankou, Guangzhou, Chongqing, and Hong Kong—have gradually rationalized their business management and production through various reform movements. Except for Hong Kong, the production figures of all factories have exceeded those before liberation by a large margin. For example, taking the total output in 1950 as 100, it was 145 in 1952, 244 in 1953, and is planned to reach 262 this year, with individual factories greatly exceeding the highest records since their establishment. In terms of profits, they are also gradually increasing, so that the enterprise's capital construction fund has increased year by year. Dividends distributed to shareholders in 1953 exceeded the average for the four years from 1949 to 1952 by a factor of one. The enterprise also feels it has abundant working capital. This fully demonstrates that the enterprise is advancing on a solid foundation.

    Recently, overseas Chinese returning to China for sightseeing often visit our factories. When they see today's "Nanyang," with the progress and development it has achieved under the care of the Party and the government, they are very happy. This makes me think of a question: what would "Nanyang" have become if the mainland of China had been liberated a few years later? The situation of "Nanyang" under the oppression and destruction of imperialism and bureaucratic capital is unbearable to recall. Today, "Nanyang," which has embarked on the road of state capitalism, is advancing towards a bright and broad road. The fifty-year experience of "Nanyang" is a microcosm of China's national industry and commerce.

    从困境中得到新生
    全国人民代表大会代表 公私合营南洋烟草公司副董事长  简玉阶
    我经营南洋兄弟烟草公司五十年了。这个企业是在一九○四年由华侨投资创办，当时主要是华侨矿工投资，不数年，产品遍销各地，后来业务发展，便公开招股，在国内各地陆续设厂，深得爱国人士的支持。但帝国主义是不甘心我国民族工业的兴起的，因此便不断地对我们威迫利诱，进行破坏。而反动的国民党政府，更勾结了帝国主义者对我们加紧压迫，曾经有过这种事情：国人制造的卷烟每过一省要纳一道税，而外商烟厂的出品，却纳一道税后便可在我国全国通行无阻。因此在第一次世界大战以后，除了五卅运动时期业务一度非常蓬勃外，“南洋”也就每况愈下，直到一九三六年，公司财务搁浅，宋子文官僚资本乘机侵入，从此“南洋”便成为官僚资本把持的企业了。他们的经营方式大家是熟悉的，他们根本无兴趣从事生产，一味投机倒把，在企业内安插私人，饱填私囊，加之以连年战祸与国民党腐朽的政治，瘫痪的经济，企业就给弄得残破不堪，奄奄一息了。
    一九四九年全国大陆相继解放，我们在大陆上的各厂也分别由当地军管会派员接管或监管，随后，在上海成立了总管理处，正式改组为公私合营企业。数年来，得到政府大力的扶持和公方的正确领导，企业就迅速从恢复走向发展。以目前来说，我们的五个厂——上海、汉口、广州、重庆和香港——由于通过了各项改革运动，逐步地使企业的经营管理和生产走向合理化，除香港外，各厂的生产数字都超过解放前很多，如以一九五○年总产量为一百，一九五二年为一百四十五，一九五三年为二百四十四，今年计划更达二百六十二，其中个别的厂大大超过了建厂以来最高的纪录。再以盈余来说，也是逐步增长，因而几年来企业基本建设基金逐年增加；分配给股东的股息一九五三年超过一九四九年至一九五二年四年平均数的一倍，企业流动资金也感到充沛。这充分说明，企业是在一个稳固基础上前进。
    最近，常常有回国观光的华侨到我们的厂去参观，当他们看见今天的“南洋”，由于得到党和政府的关怀，获得了不少的进步和发展，都感到十分高兴。这使我想起一个问题，就是全国大陆如果解放迟几年，“南洋”会变成什么样子？“南洋”在帝国主义和官僚资本的压迫摧残下的情况是不堪回首的。今天走上了国家资本主义道路的“南洋”则正朝着光明的康庄大道前进。“南洋”五十年的经历正是中国民族工商业的缩影。
