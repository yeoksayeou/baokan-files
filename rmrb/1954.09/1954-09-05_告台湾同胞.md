    A Message to Compatriots in Taiwan

    On August 22nd, all democratic parties and people's organizations in our country issued a joint declaration, solemnly announcing to the world: Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan. The joint declaration represents the will of the 600 million people on the Chinese mainland, and also represents the will of the Taiwan compatriots. It is a program of action for all Chinese people, including the people of Taiwan. The joint declaration calls on Taiwan compatriots to inherit the glorious revolutionary tradition, promote patriotism, strengthen unity, accumulate strength, and prepare to welcome the People's Liberation Army!

    Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory; the people of Taiwan are our dear compatriots. However, Taiwan is now occupied by the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and invaded by the American aggressors. The American aggressors support and aid Chiang Kai-shek's heinous rule, and the people of Taiwan suffer from the cruel oppression and exploitation of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique continues its treasonous crimes in Taiwan, acting as a tool for the American aggressor group to subvert the People's Republic of China and launch a new war, thereby further deepening the suffering of the Taiwan compatriots who are in dire straits. In order to ensure the security of the motherland, defend the integrity of the motherland's territorial sovereignty, to save our compatriots in distress, and to safeguard peace in Asia and the world, the Chinese people must complete the sacred cause of liberating Taiwan.

    The eight million Taiwan compatriots are good sons and daughters of the Chinese nation. The people of Taiwan have resisted foreign aggression and domestic reactionary rule with heroic struggles countless times. As early as the period when the Dutch and Spanish invaded and occupied Taiwan in the 17th century, Taiwan compatriots carried out many heroic uprisings against foreign rulers. When Zheng Chenggong raised troops to recover Taiwan in 1661, he received the enthusiastic support of Taiwan compatriots, which eventually led to the defeat and surrender of the Dutch colonial army. During the fifty-one years of Japanese rule from 1895 to 1945, the resistance of Taiwan compatriots was even more heroic and magnificent, and the people's resistance fought wave upon wave, never ceasing. In the fifty-one years of the Anti-Japanese War, Taiwan compatriots paid the sacrifice of more than 500,000 lives. The revolutionary struggle of Taiwan compatriots against the tyrannical rule of the Manchu Qing and Chiang Kai-shek traitorous cliques is a part of the Chinese people's revolution. Taiwan compatriots once used continuous uprisings of "minor rebellions every three years and major rebellions every five years" to resist the feudal rule of the Manchu Qing Dynasty. After the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique "took over" Taiwan, Taiwan compatriots launched a heroic armed struggle on a province-wide scale from February to March 1947, which was a heavy blow to Chiang Kai-shek's dark rule. These glorious revolutionary epics fully demonstrate the deep desire of Taiwan compatriots for the motherland and a free and happy life.

    The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique fled to Taiwan with blood debts, turning Taiwan into their treasonous lair, selling out Taiwan and the people of Taiwan in exchange for American "military aid" and "economic aid." This group of traitors, relying on the protection of the US Seventh Fleet, obeyed the orders of Chase and Rankin, shamelessly lingered in Taiwan, riding on the heads of the Taiwan people and acting like overlords. Due to Chiang's treasonous acts, the United States has completely controlled Taiwan's military, political, and economic affairs, and Taiwan has become an American military base and colony. In this situation, American soldiers run rampant in Taiwan, harming the people of Taiwan; American capital and commodities flood into Taiwan like a tide, endlessly exploiting the lifeblood of Taiwan compatriots. In order to collect cannon fodder for the United States, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique forcibly conscripts soldiers in Taiwan, forcing Taiwan farmers and students to receive military training, and prohibiting all men aged eighteen to thirty from leaving Taiwan. Obviously, Chiang not only sells Taiwan's resources, but also the blood of Taiwan compatriots to the American aggressor group. Recently, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has formulated a "Foreign Investment Regulations," selling Taiwan's mining rights, navigation rights, aviation rights, and all other economic sovereignty to American monopoly capital, and is preparing to conclude a so-called "Mutual Security Bilateral Treaty" with the United States, further binding Taiwan to the American war chariot of aggression against China. The treasonous acts of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique are absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people, including Taiwan compatriots; Chiang Kai-shek, this traitor, is a public enemy of the Chinese people.

    The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique does everything possible to auction off the interests of the country and the people to its American masters, while implementing a bloody secret service rule and exorbitant taxes on Taiwan compatriots, making it impossible for Taiwan compatriots to make a living. Under Chiang's fascist rule, Taiwan compatriots have no freedom of patriotism, no freedom of speech, and no freedom of action; Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents are all over Taiwan, Taiwan's prisons are increasingly crowded, and countless patriotic people are being killed and tortured in the concentration camps on Green Island. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is even more relentlessly exploiting Taiwan compatriots. According to the newspapers of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in Taiwan, under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, Taiwan's exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies in 1953 increased more than 22 times compared to 1949, and in the first five months of this year, they increased by 22 percent compared to the same period last year. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique also issued banknotes indiscriminately to make up for huge financial deficits. It is revealed that the "New Taiwan Dollars" issued in March 1954 increased more than 15 times compared to 1949. Under the oppression of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, batches of small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises in Taiwan have been forced to close down; the number of unemployed people is increasing, many people make a living by donating blood, and women are forced into prostitution. The tyrannical rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has become a disaster for the people of Taiwan. They are the murderers who slaughter and exploit the blood and sweat of the people of Taiwan, and owe the people of Taiwan a deep blood debt.

    The history of the struggle and the reality of life of Taiwan compatriots are full of blood and tears. In the past, in the struggle against Japan and against the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, Taiwan compatriots did not receive direct assistance from the people of the motherland, so many struggles were unfortunately frustrated. The bloody lessons of history have taught us that the revolutionary struggle of Taiwan compatriots must be closely integrated with the revolutionary struggle of the people on the mainland of the motherland. Only by relying on the strength of the people of the whole country can Taiwan compatriots be liberated.

    Taiwan compatriots! You now have a strong motherland, and you have 600 million brothers and sisters. The motherland is thinking of you and vows to assist you with all its strength. Your motherland—the People's Republic of China—has been making rapid progress in all aspects in the past five years and is becoming increasingly strong. It is already a respectable world power that cannot be ignored. Your brothers and sisters on the mainland have stood up and are engaged in national construction on an unprecedented scale, living a happy life that is constantly improving. The motherland and compatriots have the determination and strength to liberate Taiwan, and will never allow Chiang Kai-shek to sell Taiwan to the United States, never allow Taiwan to be placed under United Nations trusteeship, and will never allow so-called Taiwan "neutralization." The liberation of Taiwan is China's internal affair and brooks no interference from other countries. The Chinese people must rescue Taiwan compatriots from dire straits! We must plant the five-star red flag in Taipei and throughout Taiwan Province!

    Taiwan compatriots! In order to realize the goal of your sixty years of revolutionary struggle, to avenge the compatriots who died in the "February 28th Incident," to strive for the freedom and survival of the people of Taiwan, for the integrity of China's territory and sovereignty, and for peace in Asia and the world, Taiwan compatriots and compatriots in the motherland must strengthen unity and strive to complete the sacred cause of liberating Taiwan! We firmly believe that Taiwan must be liberated, your days of suffering will pass, and days of freedom and happiness will eventually come. The final victory is ours!

### 告台湾同胞

    告台湾同胞
    我国各民主党派各人民团体在八月二十二日发表联合宣言，郑重地向全世界宣告：台湾是中国的领土，中国人民一定要解放台湾。联合宣言代表中国大陆六万万人民的意志，也代表台湾同胞的意志，是全体中国人民包括台湾人民的行动纲领。联合宣言号召台湾同胞：继承光荣的革命传统，发扬爱国主义，加强团结，积蓄力量，准备迎接人民解放军！
    台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分；台湾人民是我们亲爱的同胞。但是，现在台湾被卖国贼蒋介石所窃据，被美国侵略者所侵占；美国侵略者支持和援助蒋介石的万恶统治，台湾人民遭受着蒋介石卖国集团残酷的压迫和剥削。蒋介石卖国集团在台湾继续它的卖国罪行，充当美国侵略集团颠覆中华人民共和国和发动新战争的工具，蓄意破坏亚洲和世界和平，从而更加深了处在水深火热中的台湾同胞的痛苦。为了保障祖国的安全，保卫祖国领土主权的完整，为了拯救陷在痛苦中的同胞，为了维护亚洲和世界的和平，中国人民一定要完成解放台湾的神圣事业。
    八百万台湾同胞是中国民族的好儿女。台湾人民无数次地以英勇的斗争反抗外来的侵略和国内的反动统治。早在十七世纪荷兰人和西班牙人侵占台湾的期间，台湾同胞即进行了许多次反抗外族统治者的英勇起义，一六六一年郑成功兴军收复台湾时，曾得到台湾同胞的热烈拥护，终使荷兰殖民军队战败投降。在一八九五年到一九四五年日本统治的五十一年间，台湾同胞的反抗更是英勇壮烈，人民的抗战前仆后继，从来没有休止。在五十一年的抗日斗争中，台湾同胞付出了五十万以上的生命的牺牲。台湾同胞反对满清和蒋介石卖国集团的暴虐统治的革命斗争，是中国人民革命的一部分。台湾同胞曾以“三年一小叛，五年一大叛”的连续起义，反抗满清的封建统治。在蒋介石卖国集团“劫收”台湾之后，台湾同胞在一九四七年二月至三月，掀起了全省规模的英雄的武装斗争，对蒋介石的黑暗统治曾是一个沉重的打击。这些光荣的革命史诗，充分表现了台湾同胞向往祖国和自由幸福生活的深切愿望。
    蒋介石卖国集团带着血债逃往台湾，把台湾变做他们的卖国巢穴，出卖台湾和台湾人民，以换取美国的“军事援助”和“经济援助”。这批卖国贼，依靠美国第七舰队的保护，听从蔡斯和兰金的命令，毫无羞耻地在台湾苟延残喘，骑在台湾人民的头上作威作福。由于蒋贼的卖国行为，美国已完全控制了台湾的军事、政治、经济，台湾变成了美国的军事基地和殖民地。在这种情况下，美国军人在台湾横行不法，祸害台湾人民；美国资本和商品如潮水一样涌入台湾，无穷尽地榨取台湾同胞的膏血。为了替美国搜罗炮灰，蒋介石卖国集团在台湾实行强迫征兵，强制台湾农民和学生受军事训练，禁止所有十八岁到三十岁的男子离开台湾。显然，蒋贼不但以台湾的资源，而且还以台湾同胞的鲜血出卖给美国侵略集团。最近，蒋介石卖国集团订出一个
  “外国人投资条例”，将台湾的开矿权、航海权、航空权以及其他一切经济主权一古脑出卖给了美国垄断资本，并准备和美国缔结所谓“共同安全双边条约”，把台湾进一步绑在美国侵略中国的战车上。蒋介石卖国集团的卖国行为是中国人民，包括台湾同胞在内绝对不能容忍的；蒋介石这个卖国贼是中国人民的公敌。
    蒋介石卖国集团对它的美国主子，竭尽一切地拍卖国家和人民的利益，对于台湾同胞则实行血腥的特务统治和横征暴敛，使台湾同胞无以聊生。在蒋贼的法西斯统治下，台湾同胞没有爱国的自由，没有说话的自由，没有行动的自由；蒋介石的特务遍布台湾，台湾的监狱日益拥挤，无数爱国志士在火烧岛的集中营中遭受着残杀和折磨。蒋介石卖国集团更对台湾同胞实行敲骨吸髓的压榨。据台湾蒋介石卖国集团的报纸透露，在蒋介石卖国集团统治下，台湾的苛捐杂税款项，一九五三年比一九四九年增加二十二倍以上，今年头五个月又比去年同期增加百分之二十二。蒋介石卖国集团并滥发钞票以弥补巨大的财政赤字，据透露，一九五四年三月所发行的“新台币”比一九四九年增加十五倍以上。在蒋介石卖国集团这样的压榨之下，台湾中小工商业一批批地被迫停闭；失业者日益增多，许多人以输血为生，妇女则被迫为娼。蒋介石卖国集团的暴虐统治已成为台湾人民的灾难，他们是屠杀和压榨台湾人民的血汗的凶犯，对台湾人民欠下了深重的血债。
    台湾同胞的奋斗的历史和现实生活都是血泪斑斑。台湾同胞过去在反抗日本和反抗蒋介石卖国集团的斗争中，得不到祖国人民的直接援助，因而多次斗争都不幸遭到挫败。血的历史教训了我们：台湾同胞的革命斗争必须和祖国大陆人民的革命斗争紧密结合起来。只有依靠全国人民的力量，台湾同胞才能得到解放。
    台湾同胞们！你们现在已经有强大的祖国了，你们有六万万的兄弟姊妹。祖国在怀念你们，誓以全力来援助你们。你们的祖国——中华人民共和国，这五年中各方面都在飞跃进步，正在日益强盛起来，它已经是不能不被承认为应受人尊重的堂堂的世界大国。你们在大陆上的兄弟姊妹们已经站立起来，正在从事于空前规模的国家建设，过着不断提高的幸福的生活。祖国和祖国同胞有决心有力量解放台湾，绝不容许蒋介石把台湾出卖给美国，绝不容许把台湾交给联合国托管，也决不容许所谓台湾“中立化”。解放台湾是中国的内政，不容他国干涉。中国人民一定要把台湾同胞从水深火热中拯救出来！一定要把五星红旗插到台北，插遍台湾全省！
    台湾同胞们！为实现你们六十年来革命斗争的目的，为“二二八事变”死难同胞报仇，为争取台湾人民的自由和生存，为中国领土和主权的完整，为亚洲及世界的和平，台湾同胞和祖国同胞要加紧团结起来，为完成解放台湾的神圣事业而奋斗！我们满怀相信，台湾一定要解放，你们苦难的日子将要过去，自由幸福的日子终要到来。最后的胜利是我们的！
