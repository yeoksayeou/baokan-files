Dear Comrades:

In the most difficult period of the Korean People's Fatherland Liberation War, you held high the banner of resisting America and aiding Korea, participated in the Korean War, fought bravely in the sacred war against the American aggressors, and gloriously completed your sacred mission and are about to return to your homeland.

On behalf of all the officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you for your glorious achievements in the Fatherland Liberation War and post-war reconstruction of our country.

From the day you joined the Korean War, you fought side by side with our People's Army soldiers, highly demonstrated collective heroism and the lofty spirit of proletarian internationalism, and recorded brilliant combat achievements in the history of our country.

From the beginning of your participation in the war, through the five major battles until the active defensive warfare, you displayed unparalleled bravery and tenacity in the battles such as the counterattack south of Kimhwa and the large-scale counterattack in July 1953.

Our People's Army soldiers deeply remember the first-class hero and special-class meritorious person Li Jiafa, who blocked the gun muzzle with his body and opened up the road for the troops to charge, as well as Zhang Furong, Tang Fengxi, Pan Changyi, the warriors of the Tiande Mountain Hero Company who repelled the enemy's frenzied attacks and held their ground, and the heroic deeds of countless heroes and models such as Guo Zhengxi and thousands of Chinese People's Volunteer Army warriors that emerged in your units.

You shared weal and woe with our People's Army soldiers, helped and encouraged each other in the trenches under any difficult conditions, and finally defeated the enemy and won the victory.

The blood you shed together with our People's Army has permeated many highlands, mountains, plains, streets and villages in our country.

You not only on the front line but also in the rear regarded the suffering of our people as your own, saved your rations and distributed them to our people, and sincerely helped our people in agriculture, medical care, and other aspects, regardless of enemy bombing.

You fought side by side with the Korean people and lived together.

The moving deeds of the internationalist fighter Luo Shengjiao, who bravely jumped into the flood to save eight women, the fourteen warriors who rescued eight women, and the four warriors who rescued our three children who fell into the sea, are vivid examples of internationalism, and they have received the deep love and respect of the Korean people.

The glorious fighters of the War to Resist America and Aid Korea—the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army—not only assisted the Korean people with blood in the just Fatherland Liberation War against the American imperialists and their lackey Syngman Rhee gang, but also, after the armistice, worked with our People's Army soldiers to monitor the enemy's conspiracy to re-launch the war with high vigilance, consolidate the peace that has been achieved, and sincerely assist us in post-war reconstruction.

The name of the warriors of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is a title full of benevolence and grace. They are our closest comrades-in-arms and have a fraternal friendship with us.

When we talk about the great victory and the brilliant achievements of reconstruction, the great movement to resist America and aid Korea of the 600 million Chinese people and the immortal feats of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the splendid miracles left on the Korean land, are unforgettable to everyone.

Dear Comrades:

The American imperialists, who are attempting to dominate the world, are opposed to the easing of international tensions and are still frantically plotting a new war of aggression in Korea.

However, all the experiences of our Fatherland Liberation War prove that any sinister conspiracies and tricks of the enemies of peace are absolutely intolerable and cannot be realized. The solid unity, strong ties, and fighting friendship forged by the people of Korea and China in their common just struggle are invincible. No machinations or struggles by the enemy can destroy the sure-to-win and invincible power of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, which have been strengthened and grown in our Fatherland Liberation War.

Today, our People's Army soldiers bid farewell to you who are returning to your country, and in the future, we will further consolidate and develop the fraternal friendship and unity with the warriors of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, constantly strengthen our combat effectiveness, and are full of determination to resolutely defend the creative labor achievements of our people.

With the great material and spiritual assistance of the people of the great Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people of various people's democratic countries, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, the Republic Government, and the respected leader Marshal Kim Il-sung, the Korean people will surely achieve victory in the great cause of post-war economic reconstruction and the peaceful reunification of the motherland, just as they achieved victory in the war.

I wish you greater victories and achievements in the sacred struggle for the prosperity and development of the new China and the consolidation of peace in Asia and the world!

Long live the unbreakable fighting friendship between the people of Korea and China!

Long live the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army!

Long live the internationalist friendship and unity among the people of the countries of the peace, democracy and socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union!

    朝鲜人民军总政治局局长崔宗学的欢送词亲爱的同志们：
    在朝鲜人民祖国解放战争处于最困难的时期，你们高举抗美援朝的旗帜，参加了朝鲜战争，在共同反对美国侵略者的神圣战争中英勇作战，光荣地完成了自己的神圣任务，将要返回祖国。
    我代表全体朝鲜人民军将士，谨向在我祖国解放战争中和战后恢复建设中留下辉煌功勋而回国的你们致以衷心的感谢。
    你们从参加朝鲜战争的那一天起，就和我人民军将士并肩作战，高度发挥了集体英雄主义和崇高的无产阶级国际主义的精神，在我国的历史上记下了光辉灿烂的战斗功勋。
    你们从参战开始经过五次主要战役直到积极进行防御战的期间，在金城以南反击战、一九五三年七月的大规模反击战等历次战斗中，发挥了无比的英勇、顽强的精神。
    我们人民军将士们深深记住舍身堵塞枪口，为部队开辟了冲锋道路的一级英雄、特等功臣李家发，以及张福荣、唐凤喜、潘昌义，打退敌人疯狂进攻并守住高地的天德山英雄连的勇士们以及郭正喜等在你们部队中涌现出无数英雄、模范的功绩和成千成万的中国人民志愿军勇士们的斗争事迹。
    你们和我们人民军将士同甘苦，在任何困难的条件下都不屈不挠地在战壕里互相帮助和鼓励，终于打败了敌人，取得了胜利。
    你们和我们人民军一起流下的鲜血，渗透在我们祖国的许多高地、山岳、原野、街头和村庄里。
    你们不仅在战线上而且在后方也把我国人民的痛苦当作自己的痛苦，节约自己的口粮分给我国人民，并且不顾敌机的轰炸，在农业、医疗等各方面诚挚地帮助了我国人民。
    你们和朝鲜人民并肩作战，并在一起生活。
    你们部队中涌现的国际主义战士罗盛教烈士，英勇跃进洪水拯救了八名妇女的十四勇士和抢救落海的我们三个儿童的四勇士的动人事迹，是国际主义的活生生的榜样，他们受到了朝鲜人民的日益加深的深厚爱戴和尊敬。
    抗美援朝的光荣战士——中国人民志愿军指挥员、战斗员们不但以鲜血援助了朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚匪帮的正义的祖国解放战争，而且在停战后和我们人民军将士一起以高度的警惕监视着敌人重新发动战争的阴谋，巩固着已取得的和平，并诚心诚意地协助我们进行战后恢复建设工作。
    中国人民志愿军勇士的名字是充满了仁慈和惠泽的称号，他们是我们最亲近的战友，和我们有着亲兄弟般的情谊。
    当我们谈到伟大的胜利和恢复建设的辉煌成就时，六万万中国人民伟大的抗美援朝运动和英勇的中国人民志愿军的不朽功勋在朝鲜土地上所遗留的灿烂奇迹，是我们每一个人都忘记不了的。
    亲爱的同志们：
    妄想称霸世界的美帝国主义者反对国际紧张局势的缓和，还在朝鲜疯狂地策划着新的侵略战争。
    但是我祖国解放战争的所有经验证明：和平的敌人的任何凶恶的阴谋策动和诡计都是绝对不能被容忍，也是不能实现的。朝中两国人民在正义的共同斗争中结成的巩固的团结、坚强的联系和战斗的友谊是不可战胜的。敌人的任何策动和挣扎也决不可能摧毁在我祖国解放战争中加强起来并锻炼成长的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的必胜不败的威力。
    我们人民军将士们今天欢送着返国的你们，今后要更加巩固、发展和中国人民志愿军勇士的兄弟般的友谊和团结，不断加强自己的战斗力，并充满了坚决保卫我们人民创造性的劳动成就的决心。
    朝鲜人民在伟大的苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家人民的巨大的物质和精神援助下，在朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府和敬爱的领袖金日成元帅的领导下，在战后人民经济恢复建设和祖国和平统一的伟大事业中也必将像在战争中取得胜利一样取得胜利。
    谨祝你们在为新中国的昌盛发展和巩固亚洲及世界和平的神圣斗争中获得更大的胜利和成就！
    朝中两国人民牢不可破的战斗友谊万岁！
    英雄的中国人民志愿军万岁！
    以伟大的苏联为首的和平民主和社会主义阵营各国人民之间的国际主义友谊团结万岁！
