Editor's Note: Over the past five years, China's people's judicial organs and public security organs, relying on the active support of the broad masses of the people, have gradually established and improved their own organizations and various working systems, heavily cracked down on the remaining counter-revolutionary elements, and punished other illegal and criminal elements according to law, protecting the revolutionary social order and the democratic rights of the people, and ensuring the rapid recovery and development of China's national economy. Now that the country has entered a period of large-scale planned economic construction and the Constitution of the People's Republic of China has been promulgated, people's judicial organs and public security organs at all levels should, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, further improve and apply the people's democratic legal system, continue to resolutely fight against all counter-revolutionary elements and other illegal and criminal elements, further consolidate China's people's democratic dictatorship, ensure the smooth implementation of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and all laws, and ensure the smooth progress of the country's socialist economic construction and socialist transformation.

The Achievements of People's Judicial Work in the Northwest over the Past Five Years
Ma Xiwu

The people's judicial work in the Northwest region has a long history. As early as 1933, after the establishment of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Revolutionary Committee, there was people's judicial work. In 1935, after the Party Central Committee arrived in northern Shaanxi, the people's judicial work in the Northwest region further developed, launching extensive trial activities in coordination with the central work of each revolutionary war period, playing a significant role in consolidating the people's democratic power and safeguarding the interests of the masses.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China five years ago, thanks to the correct leadership of Party and government organs at all levels, the active support and supervision of the broad masses of the people, and the close cooperation of relevant organs, the people's judicial work in the Northwest region has achieved greater development. According to the "Provisional Organizational Regulations of the People's Courts of the People's Republic of China," 346 people's courts at all levels have been established successively in the Northwest region. Working in them are veteran cadres who have been tempered by long-term revolutionary struggles, young intellectuals who have been trained in recent years, and active elements absorbed from various people's court work. In ethnic minority areas, a certain number of ethnic minority judicial cadres have also been trained. Over the past few years, people's courts at all levels in the Northwest region have powerfully cooperated with various social democratic reform movements, handling more than 740,000 criminal and civil cases of various types, protecting the people's democratic rights from the judicial aspect and ensuring the smooth completion of various movements. In 1950, when the struggle to reform the land system began in the Han areas of the Northwest, people's courts at all levels formed and dispatched 157 county and city land reform people's courts and 201 district courts, promptly handling 10,465 criminal cases involving special agents, bandits, despots, and lawless landlords who sabotaged the struggle to reform the land system, severely suppressing the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements, punishing despots and lawless landlords, effectively supporting the just struggle of peasants against feudalism, raising the class consciousness and production enthusiasm of the broad working people, and consolidating the fruits of victory of the peasant masses. In the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, the people's courts also cooperated closely with the public security organs, forming people's courts, relying on the strong support of the broad masses of the people, and handling a large number of counter-revolutionary cases, totaling 38,198, raising the political vigilance of the people and stabilizing social order. In the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, people's courts at all levels in the Northwest region also organized 125 people's courts and 8 district courts, severely cracking down on the attacks of lawless bourgeois elements according to the spirit of the Regulations on Punishing Corruption, educating cadres to draw a clear line between the ideology of the working class and the bourgeoisie, and establishing a revolutionary, clean, and simple work style and new socialist morality. Since the country entered a period of planned economic construction and the Party Central Committee clearly put forward the general task of the country during the transition period, judicial organizations at all levels in the Northwest region are actively serving the general task.

Because they can closely combine with the central work of the country in various periods, the development of judicial work in the Northwest region is very rapid. In the early days of the establishment of our country, the tasks of judicial work were very heavy, and there was no time to rectify it in all aspects, so the impure situation in the ideological style and organization of the people's judicial organs at that time existed to varying degrees. In addition to strengthening the daily study of cadres, under the unified arrangement and leadership of the Central Government, from 1952 to the spring of 1953, people's courts at all levels in the Northwest carried out a mass judicial reform movement to rectify and purify people's courts at all levels organizationally and ideologically. In this movement, the whole region resolutely dealt with bad elements who had infiltrated the courts; at the same time, it boldly selected a large number of outstanding workers and peasants who emerged in various mass movements to enrich people's courts at all levels. Through this movement, all judicial workers received the most profound and practical class education and mass test. For wrongly arrested and wrongly judged cases discovered in the judicial reform, public retrials and corrections were carried out, and judicial workers who were responsible for the wrong judgments publicly made self-criticisms to the masses or were given due punishments. All old legal views were severely criticized, clarifying many confused ideas among judicial cadres, enabling them to basically draw a clear line between new and old laws, recognizing the harm of reactionary old legal views and old judicial styles to the country and the people, changing the trial style of some judicial personnel who were detached from reality, simply sitting in court to hear cases, subjectively speculating, and judging cases according to routine, and understanding the importance of attracting the people to participate in the construction of judicial work. According to statistics from Shaanxi and Gansu provinces and Xi'an City, about 6.65 million people actively participated in this judicial reform, and even more people were educated. The broad masses of the people expressed great satisfaction and sincere support for the court's humbly soliciting their opinions, conscientiously and responsibly handling the problems they raised, and publicly retrying wrongly judged cases, believing that "this is really the people's court under the leadership of Chairman Mao," which greatly enhanced the enthusiasm of the people to participate in supervising judicial work.

On the basis of the victory of the judicial reform movement, in order to further organize people's litigation and more effectively resolve disputes, people's courts at the grassroots level gradually established organizations to contact the masses and the people's assessor system.

First, circuit courts were organized and dispatched in a planned way. The circuit court is a very important creation of people's judicial work in the long-term actual struggle. As early as the Anti-Japanese War period, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region already had a way of conducting trials on circuit. After the Second National Judicial Conference in April 1953 determined the circuit court as a system of people's judicial work, county-level courts in various parts of the Northwest actively carried out this judicial construction work. According to statistics, 327 circuit courts have now been established in the Northwest region. The circuit courts go deep into the countryside to handle cases, which not only facilitates people's litigation but also more effectively serves the central work. According to statistics from 17 circuit courts in various counties of Wuwei Prefecture, Gansu Province, 30% of the criminal and civil cases they accepted in half a year were directly related to agricultural production and mutual aid cooperation. Circuit courts in various places can first seize cases related to the local central work and deal with them in a timely manner. For example, Zhang Shenghai, a hooligan in the second district of Gulang County, colluded with landlords and other bad elements to try to undermine the Dingningzhai agricultural production cooperative in the district. They secretly dug up the canal and falsely accused the people of the agricultural production cooperative of doing it, trying to cause disputes between members and non-members. After investigation and trial by the Gulang County Court's circuit court, this conspiracy was exposed, and Zhang Shenghai and others were arrested and brought to justice, greatly strengthening the confidence of the members in running the cooperative. However, the shortcomings of the circuit court are that the mobility is too great, and there is also a side that is not conducive to people's litigation, which must be improved.

Second, 169 people's reception rooms have been established. In addition to answering difficult questions for the masses, drafting complaints for litigants, and recording oral statements, people's reception rooms generally attach importance to handling people's letters and receiving people's visits. Therefore, people's letters and visits to courts in the Northwest region are increasing day by day. The number of people's letters received by the Shaanxi Provincial People's Court in 1953 increased more than three times compared with 1952. These letters put forward many suggestions and criticisms on the work of the court, which played a good role in improving and raising the work of the court. Among the masses, there are often disputes caused by unclear policies or quarrels. After the people's reception room patiently explained the policies and conducted persuasion and education, many parties raised their ideological understanding and automatically reconciled and withdrew the cases. From September to December 1953, after the persuasion and explanation of the reception room of the Nanzheng County People's Court in southern Shaanxi, the parties automatically reconciled or withdrew 266 disputes, accounting for 48% of the total number of cases accepted by the court during the same period. This enables the court to concentrate its efforts on handling major cases.

Third, people's mediation committees have been universally established and improved. As early as the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region period, we began to attach importance to and establish people's mediation committees. At present, in 87 counties and cities in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces alone, there are 9,073 mediation organizations, with 43,654 mediators elected by the masses. The facts over the years have proved that this method of using the strength of the masses to solve internal disputes among the masses has many advantages. It not only enables disputes to be handled in a timely and correct manner, greatly facilitating the masses; but also, because the disputes are mediated and resolved by the masses themselves, it can further enhance the internal unity of the people, raise the political awareness and production enthusiasm of the people, and prevent and reduce the occurrence of disputes. When Chenjiagou Village in Lantian County, Shaanxi Province, was repairing a canal for irrigation, the canal was too wide and occupied a part of the masses' cultivated land, causing fighting and disputes. After the local mediation committee repeatedly explained the principles of mutual assistance, friendship, unity, and production and the water conservancy policy of the People's Government to the masses, it took the lead in mobilizing the masses to raise the embankment and deepen the canal, expanding the capacity of the canal and reducing the cultivated land occupied by the canal, thus calming the masses' disputes. The masses were very moved and wrote a song praising the mediation committee. The lyrics are: "The mediation committee is really capable, handling affairs for the people, not talking about face and not playing favoritism, mediating cases fairly and justly." Due to the good mediation work, disputes in Daihebao Village, Liuxiang, District 1, Lintong County, Shaanxi Province, decreased day by day. In the winter of 1951, a total of 21 disputes occurred in this village, which decreased to 19 in 1952, and only 3 occurred from January to August 1953.

Fourth, the people's assessor system has been further established and improved, attracting the broad masses of the people to participate in the state's trial work. People's courts in various parts of the Northwest have elected 20,745 fixed people's assessors in conjunction with the grassroots election work. It must be pointed out that the assessor system implemented by our people's courts is fundamentally different from the hypocritical so-called assessor system in capitalist countries. Our people's assessor system is based on true democracy, and it is a major measure for the people to participate in national management; and our people's assessors truly represent the opinions of the people. In the trial of cases, courts in various places fully respect the power of the people's assessors and help them continuously improve their policy and professional level in their actual work. Through the participation of people's assessors in the trial of cases, not only is the court supervised to handle cases correctly, but also the people's sense of responsibility and ownership of the country is enhanced. From January to March this year, in the 68 cases tried by the Fourth District Court of Xi'an City with the participation of assessors, only one was appealed. Wang Hongen, an assessor in Lintong County, took the initiative to go deep into the masses to investigate and verify materials in the process of assessing a house lease case, put forward sufficient reasons, refuted the defendant's unreasonable sophistry, and enabled the case to be handled correctly quickly.

Although judicial work in the Northwest region has achieved the above-mentioned achievements, there are still some shortcomings. Some county people's courts have not yet firmly grasped the handling of cases related to harming and undermining national economic construction, the importance of establishing a regular revolutionary legal system is not fully understood, the people's assessor system has not been earnestly implemented, and some people's mediation committees are perfunctory and ineffective. In the future, we must strengthen the political, theoretical, and professional education of cadres, systematically summarize the experience of various tasks, so as to overcome various shortcomings in the work and strive to establish a more perfect and regular judicial system.

    五年来西北人民司法工作的成就
    马锡五
    西北地区的人民司法工作有着长期的历史。早在一九三三年陕甘宁边区革命委员会成立后，就有了人民司法工作。一九三五年，党中央到达陕北以后，西北地区的人民司法工作有了进一步的发展，配合着各个革命战争时期的中心工作，展开了广泛的审判活动，在巩固人民民主政权、维护群众利益上起了重大的作用。
    中华人民共和国成立五年以来，由于各级党、政机关的正确领导，依靠广大人民的积极支持与监督，和有关机关的密切配合，西北地区的人民司法工作获得了更大的发展。根据“中华人民共和国法院暂行组织条例”的规定，西北地区已先后成立了各级人民法院三百四十六个，在其中工作的有经过长期革命斗争锻炼的老干部，有近几年训练的青年知识分子，也有从各种人民法庭工作中吸收的积极分子。在少数民族地区，还培养了一定数量的少数民族司法干部。几年来，西北地区各级人民法院有力地配合了各项社会民主改革运动，处理了各种类型的刑事民事案件七十四万余件，从司法方面保护了人民的民主权利，保障了各项运动的顺利完成。一九五○年西北汉族地区开始进行改革土地制度的斗争时，各级人民法院组成和派出了一百五十七个县、市土地改革人民法庭和二百零一个区分庭，及时处理了特务、土匪、恶霸及不法地主等破坏改革土地制度斗争等的刑事案件一万零四百六十五件，严厉地镇压了反革命分子的破坏活动，惩办了恶霸和不法地主，有效地支持了农民反对封建主义的正义斗争，提高了广大劳动人民的阶级觉悟和生产热情，巩固了农民群众的胜利果实。在镇压反革命运动中，人民法院又与公安机关通力合作，组成人民法庭，依靠广大人民的有力支持，处理了大批的反革命案件三万八千一百九十八件，提高了人民群众的政治警惕性，安定了社会秩序。在“三反”、“五反”运动中，西北地区各级人民法院也组织了人民法庭一百二十五个和区分庭八个，根据惩治贪污条例的精神，严重地打击了不法资产阶级分子的进攻，教育干部划清了工人阶级与资产阶级的思想界限，树立了革命的廉洁朴素的作风和社会主义的新道德。自国家进入有计划的经济建设时期，党中央明确地提出国家在过渡时期的总任务以后，西北地区的各级司法组织正在积极为总任务服务。
    由于能够密切结合各个时期国家的中心工作，西北地区的司法工作的发展是很迅速的。在我们国家建立的初期，司法工作的任务很繁重，来不及从各方面加以整顿，所以当时人民司法机关的思想作风上、组织上不同程度的不纯情况是存在的。我们除了加强干部的日常学习外，在中央的统一布置和领导下，从一九五二年起到一九五三年春季止，西北各级人民法院进行了一次群众性的司法改革运动，从组织上思想上整顿和纯洁了各级人民法院。全区在这一运动中，坚决地处理了混入法院的坏分子；同时也大胆放手地选拔了在各种群众运动中涌现出来的大批工农优秀分子，充实了各级人民法院。经过这次运动，使所有司法工作人员都受到了一次最深刻、最实际的阶级教育和群众性的考验。对于司法改革中发现的错押、错判案件，公开进行了改判和纠正，负有错判责任的司法工作人员公开向群众做了检讨，或受到应得的处分。对于一切旧法观点给予了严厉的批判，澄清了司法干部中的许多糊涂观念，使他们基本上划清了新旧法律的界限，认识了反动旧法观点与旧司法作风对于国家和人民的危害性，改变了若干司法人员脱离实际的单纯坐堂问案、主观臆断和照例判案的审判作风，更懂得了吸引人民群众参加司法建设工作的重要性。据陕西、甘肃两省和西安市的统计，积极参加这次司法改革的群众约六百六十五万人，受到教育的人更多。广大群众对于法院虚心征求他们的意见，认真负责地处理他们提出的问题，公开改判错判的案件，表示十分满意和衷诚拥护，认为“这真是毛主席领导下的人民法院”，大大提高了人民群众参加监督司法工作的积极性。
    在司法改革运动胜利的基础上，各基层人民法院为了进一步组织人民诉讼和更加有效地解决纠纷，逐步地建立了联系群众的组织和人民陪审制度。
    首先是有计划地组成和派出了巡回法庭。巡回法庭，这是人民司法工作在长期实际斗争中一个很重要的创造。远在抗日战争时期，陕甘宁边区就已经有了巡回就审的活动方式。一九五三年四月第二届全国司法会议把巡回法庭确定为人民司法工作的一种制度之后，西北各地的县级法院积极地进行了这项司法建设工作。据统计，目前西北地区已建立了三百二十七个巡回法庭。巡回法庭深入农村办案，不但便利人民诉讼，而且能够更有效地为中心工作服务。根据甘肃省武威专区各县的十七个巡回法庭的统计，他们半年来所受理的刑民案件中，有百分之三十都是直接有关农业生产和互助合作的案件。各地巡回法庭都能首先抓住有关当地中心工作的案件，及时予以处理。如古浪县二区流氓分子张生海勾结地主和其他坏分子，企图搞垮该区定宁寨农业生产合作社，他们偷着将水渠挖开，反诬赖说是农业生产合作社的人干的，企图引起社员与非社员之间的纠纷。经过古浪县法院巡回法庭调查审讯，揭穿了这一阴谋，将张生海等逮捕法办，大大地加强了社员们办社的信心，但巡回法庭的缺点是流动性太大，还有不利于人民诉讼的一面，还必须予以提高。
    第二，建立了人民接待室一百六十九个。人民接待室除为群众解答疑难问题，为诉讼当事人代写诉状，代录口诉外，一般都重视处理人民来信和接见人民来访的工作，因而目前西北地区法院的人民来信来访日益增加。陕西省人民法院一九五三年的人民来信比一九五二年增加了三倍以上。这些来信对法院的工作提出了许多建议和批评，对于改进和提高法院的工作起了良好的作用。在群众中，经常有由于不明政策或因口角之争而引起的纠纷，经过人民接待室耐心讲解政策、进行说服教育以后，不少当事人提高了思想认识，就自动和解和撤销案件。一九五三年九月到十二月，经过陕西南郑县人民法院接待室的说服解释，当事人自动和解或撤销的纠纷就有二百六十六件，占同期法院总收案数的百分之四十八。这样就使法院能够集中力量处理重大案件。
    第三，普遍建立和健全了人民调解委员会。早在陕甘宁边区时期，我们就开始重视和建立了人民调解委员会，目前仅陕西、甘肃两省的八十七个县、市，就有调解组织九千零七十三个，由群众选出的调解人员达四万三千六百五十四人。多年来的事实证明，这种运用群众力量解决群众内部纠纷的办法，有很多好处，不但使纠纷得到及时正确的处理，大大地便利了群众；而且由于纠纷是群众自己调解解决的，因而更加能够增强人民内部的团结，提高人民群众的政治觉悟和生产积极性，预防和减少纠纷的发生。陕西蓝田县陈家沟在修水渠灌田时，因所修水渠太宽，多占了一部分群众的耕地面积，引起了打架纠纷。当地调解委员会在向群众反复地讲解了互助友爱团结生产的道理和人民政府的水利政策后，带头发动群众把渠堰修高，把渠道挖深，扩大了水渠的容量，缩小了渠道所占的耕地，平息了群众纠纷，群众很受感动，编了一首歌颂调解委员的歌子。歌词是：“调解委员真能干，为着人民把事办，不讲面子不耍私情，公公道道调解案件。”陕西临潼县一区六乡代河堡村，由于调解工作做的好，纠纷一天比一天减少。一九五一年冬，这个村子共发生了二十一件纠纷，到一九五二年就减少为十九件，而在一九五三年一至八月间只发生了三件。
    第四，进一步建立和健全了人民陪审制度，吸引了广大人民群众参加国家审判工作。西北各地人民法院结合基层选举工作，选出了固定人民陪审员二万零七百四十五人。必须指出，我们人民法院所实行的陪审制，是和资本主义国家的虚伪的所谓陪审制有着根本不同的，我们的人民陪审制建立在真正民主的基础之上，它是人民参加国家管理工作的一项重大措施；而我们的人民陪审员也是真正代表人民的意见的。各地法院在审判案件中，都十分尊重人民陪审员的权力，并在实际工作中帮助他们不断地提高自己的政策、业务水平。通过人民陪审员参加审判案件，不仅监督法院正确地处理案件，而且提高了人民对国家的责任心和主人翁感。今年
  一月到三月西安市第四区法院有陪审员参加审理的六十八件案件中，上诉的只有一件。临潼县陪审员王鸿恩，在陪审一件房屋租赁案件的过程中，主动地深入群众调查对证材料，提出充分理由，批驳了被告的无理狡辩，使案件迅速得到正确的处理。
    西北地区的司法工作虽已获得上述成绩，但是也还存在一些缺点。部分县人民法院至今还没有抓紧处理有关危害和破坏国家经济建设的案件，对于建立正规的革命法制的重要性认识不足，没有认真地实行人民陪审制，有些人民调解委员会流于形式，不起作用。今后必须加强对干部的政治、理论和业务教育，系统地总结各项工作经验，以克服工作中的各种缺点，为建立更加完善的正规的司法制度而努力。
