Xinhua News Agency, September 7th: Manila dispatch: The conference convened by the United States to organize the Southeast Asia war bloc opened in Manila, Philippines, on the 6th. Representatives from eight countries are participating: the United States, Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Thailand, and Pakistan.

Of these eight countries participating in the conference, five are not Asian countries, and the three Asian countries have already concluded bilateral military treaties with the United States. Major Southeast Asian countries such as India, Indonesia, Burma, and Ceylon have refused to participate in this conference. Broad public opinion in Asia has long pointed out that the Southeast Asia group concocted by the United States is nothing more than an aggressive alliance of colonial countries hostile to the people of Asia and China.

The United States had tried to make the Manila Conference a meeting at the level of foreign ministers. However, among the eight countries participating in the conference, British Foreign Secretary Eden and French Foreign Minister Mendès France did not attend. According to Philippine newspaper reports, US Secretary of State Dulles was very unhappy that Eden did not attend the meeting.

At the opening meeting on the 6th, Dulles, the convener of the meeting, delivered a speech, openly stating the goals pursued by the United States in organizing the Southeast Asia group.

After clamoring against so-called international communism, Dulles demanded that the countries participating in the Manila Conference "develop individual and collective" armed forces in order to coordinate with the "fully and sufficiently coordinated" actions of the US "mobile strike force." This means that the United States wants to bind Southeast Asian countries to its war chariot and prepare for new wars of aggression by using the method of "Asians fighting Asians," thereby undermining peace and security in Asia.

Dulles's speech showed that the Southeast Asia group is directly opposed to the people of Asia. He demanded that the participating countries "go all out" to deal with the so-called "dangers of subversion and indirect aggression," "just as President Magsaysay has demonstrated here (in the Philippines)." Everyone knows that Magsaysay's "performance" praised by Dulles is the frenzied suppression of the demands of the Philippine people for independence and freedom under the direct support of the United States. Dulles's words show that the United States attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of Southeast Asian countries through the Southeast Asia Pact in the same way as it interferes in the internal affairs of the Philippines, to suppress the national liberation movements of Southeast Asian countries in the same way as it suppresses the Philippine national liberation movement, and to transform Southeast Asian countries into US colonies and bases of aggression in the same way as it enslaves the Philippine people.

Dulles did not hide his intention to undermine the Geneva Accords on restoring peace in Indochina. He stated that he would place Cambodia, Laos, and South Vietnam under the "protection" of the Southeast Asia group.

Dulles stated that discussing the "economic aspects" of the Southeast Asia military group was in order to "attract other countries to join." He also said that the Manila Conference would not discuss "economic plans."

Dulles admitted that there were still "some differences to be resolved" among the countries participating in the Manila Conference. Many reports say that Dulles's task at the meeting is to force other countries to accept the US draft.

At the opening meeting, representatives of other participating countries also delivered speeches.

The representatives of the Philippines and Thailand were Dulles's most enthusiastic trumpeters. Philippine President Magsaysay openly expressed opposition to peaceful coexistence, and Philippine Foreign Minister Garcia and Thai Foreign Minister Naradhip both tried their best to advocate that the Southeast Asia group should become a "powerful" aggressive group that tightly binds all participating countries to the US war chariot and can "take action quickly and effectively." The difference is that Garcia wanted to whitewash the colonial nature of this group, while Naradhip nakedly emphasized the need to suppress the national independence movements of various countries, which he called so-called "subversive activities."

The Pakistani representative supported the organization of the Southeast Asia aggressive group, but he advocated that this group should not only oppose communism but also oppose so-called all kinds of "aggression." The Australian and New Zealand representatives both tried to conceal the aggressive nature of the Southeast Asia group, believing that in addition to military aspects, attention should also be paid to economic aspects, and some economic measures should be stipulated.

In his speech, British representative Marquess of Reading supported the organization of an aggressive Southeast Asia military group, while at the same time contradictorily expressing the hope for peaceful coexistence with all countries. He particularly urged people not to misunderstand that Britain's proposition was just for a powerless treaty. Marquess of Reading also explained the reason why Eden could not attend the meeting.

French representative Lachamp also explained the reason why the French Foreign Minister could not attend and expressed support for the Southeast Asia aggressive group. But he described this aggressive group as if it had a "peaceful nature," vainly trying to convince people that it "is not forming a hostile group in Asia."

After holding the opening meeting on the morning of the 6th, the representatives of the eight countries held continuous secret meetings on the afternoon of the 6th and the 7th to discuss the draft Southeast Asia Pact proposed by the United States. According to foreign news agencies, Dulles has launched intense activities outside the meeting in order to get the participating countries to accept the draft pact drawn up by the United States.

    美国拼凑东南亚集团的马尼拉会议开幕
    杜勒斯进行紧张活动打算强迫其他国家接受美制草案
   【新华社七日讯】马尼拉消息：美国召集的组织东南亚战争集团的会议六日在菲律宾的马尼拉开幕。参加会议的有美国、英国、法国、澳大利亚、新西兰、菲律宾、泰国和巴基斯坦八国的代表。
    参加会议的这八个国家中，有五个并非亚洲国家，而三个亚洲国家也都是早已和美国缔结了双边军事条约的。像印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸和锡兰这样一些主要的东南亚国家都拒绝参加这个会议。亚洲的广大舆论早已指出，美国拼凑的东南亚集团，不过是一个敌视亚洲和中国人民的殖民国家的侵略联盟。
    美国曾经努力使马尼拉会议成为外交部长一级的会议。但是，在参加会议的八个国家中，英国外交大臣艾登和法国外交部长孟戴斯—弗朗斯都没有出席会议。据菲律宾报纸消息说，美国国务卿杜勒斯对于艾登不出席会议感到很不高兴。
    在六日的开幕会议上，会议的召集人杜勒斯发表演说，露骨地说明了美国组织东南亚集团所追求的目标。
    杜勒斯在叫嚣反对所谓国际共产主义之后，要求参加马尼拉会议的国家“发展各别的和集体的”武装力量，以便和美国“机动性进击力量”作“充分与十分协调”的协同行动。这也就是说，美国要把东南亚国家缚上美国的战车，并且用“亚洲人打亚洲人”的办法来准备新的侵略战争，破坏亚洲的和平和安全。
    杜勒斯的讲话表明，东南亚集团是直接反对亚洲人民的。他要求与会各国“全力以赴”地对付所谓“颠覆和间接侵略的危险”，“正如麦格赛赛总统在这里（菲律宾）所表现的那样”。大家知道，杜勒斯所称赞的麦格赛赛的“表现”，就是在美国直接支持之下对菲律宾人民独立与自由的要求的疯狂镇压。杜勒斯的话表明美国企图通过东南亚公约像干涉菲律宾内政一样地干涉东南亚国家内政，像镇压菲律宾民族解放运动一样地镇压东南亚国家民族解放运动，像奴役菲律宾人民一样地变东南亚国家为美国的殖民地和侵略基地。
    杜勒斯并不隐藏他要破坏日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平的协议，他表示要把柬埔寨、老挝和越南南部置于东南亚集团的“保护”之下。
    杜勒斯表示，谈论东南亚军事集团的“经济方面”，是为了使“其他国家也参加进来”。他又说，马尼拉会议将不讨论“经济计划”。
    杜勒斯承认，马尼拉会议与会国家间还“要解决一些分歧”。许多消息都说，杜勒斯在会上的任务就是要强迫其他国家接受美国的草案。
    在开幕会议上，其他参加会议的国家的代表也发表了演说。
    菲律宾和泰国的代表是杜勒斯的最热心的吹鼓手。菲律宾总统麦格赛赛公开表示反对和平共处，菲律宾外长加西亚和泰国外长那拉比都竭力主张东南亚集团应该成为一个把所有参加国都紧紧缚在美国战车上的“强有力的”、能够“迅速和有效地采取行动”的侵略集团。不同的是加西亚想粉饰一下这个集团的殖民性质，而那拉比则赤裸裸地强调要镇压各国的民族独立运动，他把这一运动称之为所谓“颠覆活动”。
    巴基斯坦代表支持组织东南亚侵略集团，但他主张这个集团不仅反共，而且要反对所谓各种类的“侵略”。澳大利亚代表和新西兰代表都力图掩饰东南亚集团的侵略性，他认为除了军事方面以外还要注意经济方面，应该规定一些经济方面的措施。
    英国代表里丁侯爵在发言中支持组织侵略性的东南亚军事集团，同时却又自相矛盾地表示希望和各国和平共处。他特别叫人不要误解英国的主张是只要一个毫无力量的条约。里丁侯爵还解释艾登不能出席会议的原因。
    法国代表拉香波也解释法国外长所以不能出席的原因，并表示支持东南亚侵略集团。但是他又把这个侵略集团说成好像是具有“和平的性质”，徒劳地企图叫人相信它“并不是在亚洲成立敌对集团”。
    马尼拉会议在六日上午举行开幕会议后，六日下午及七日八国代表连续举行秘密会议，讨论美国提出的东南亚公约草案。据外国通讯社报道，为了使与会各国接受美国拟订的公约草案，杜勒斯已经在会外展开了紧张的活动。
