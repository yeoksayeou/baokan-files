    [This Newspaper's News] The broad masses in various regions actively support the state's implementation of planned acquisition and planned supply of cotton cloth. Guo Baozhen, a family member of a worker in the Workers' New Village in Shenyang City, said: "The government's implementation of planned cotton cloth supply is like delivering cotton cloth directly to our hands. We are no longer afraid of unscrupulous merchants causing trouble." Gao Fuchang, a worker at the Baoding Power Plant in Hebei Province, said: "I firmly support the planned supply of cotton cloth. This can eliminate market speculation and consolidate price stability."
    Tianjin, Baoding, Shenyang, Changchun, Zhengzhou and other places have successively started supplying cotton cloth to citizens in accordance with the regulations on planned cotton cloth supply. The market is stable, and the order is good. On the 15th, as soon as the shops in Tianjin opened for business, many citizens held their cloth purchase certificates and selected cloth in an orderly manner. Department stores in Changchun City prepared a large number of various cloths. On that day, a total of 409 types of cloth, including twill, small floral drill, coarse cloth, and fine cloth of various qualities and colors, were displayed on the counters to meet customers. Hebei Province's Baoding City has set up additional invoice stations to ensure timely distribution of cloth purchase coupons to citizens. The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company has added business offices, which have started business around the 15th, and has entrusted supply and marketing cooperatives to carry out wholesale business on its behalf.
    In order to facilitate customers in purchasing cotton cloth, the employees of the state-owned commercial departments and cooperative retail stores in Tianjin City carefully studied ways to simplify the procedures for planned cotton cloth supply as much as possible on the 14th. Before the implementation of planned cotton cloth supply in Shenyang City, the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company actively prepared the supply of goods. The Zhengzhou City Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company in Henan Province had already transferred a large amount of cotton cloth, and the current cotton cloth inventory is more than double that of the same period last year.

    天津沈阳长春等市人民
    拥护棉布计划供应市场秩序良好
     【本报讯】各地广大群众积极拥护国家实行棉布计划收购、计划供应。沈阳市工人新村职工家属郭宝贞说：“政府实行棉布计划供应，就等于把棉布送到我们手里，再也不怕奸商捣乱了。”河北省保定市发电厂工人高福长说：“我坚决拥护棉布计划供应。这样才能取缔市场投机，巩固物价稳定。”
    天津、保定、沈阳、长春、郑州各地已先后开始按照棉布计划供应的规定开始供应市民棉布，市场平稳，秩序良好。十五日，天津各商店一开始营业，许多市民都手执购布证有秩序地选购布匹。长春市各百货商店准备了大批各种布匹，当天摆在柜台上和顾客见面的布匹共有四百零九种，包括各种质量颜色的斜纹、小花哔叽、粗细布等。河北省保定市增设了发票站，保证及时地向市民分发购布票。花纱布公司增设了营业处，在十五日前后已开始营业，并委托供销社代行批发业务。
    为了便利顾客购买棉布，天津市国营商业部门和合作社所属零售店的职工们，在十四日就详细研究尽量简化棉布计划供应的手续。沈阳市在实行棉布计划供应以前，花纱布公司就积极准备了货源。河南省郑州市花纱布公司早已调运到大批棉布，目前棉布的库存量，比去年同期增加了一倍多。
