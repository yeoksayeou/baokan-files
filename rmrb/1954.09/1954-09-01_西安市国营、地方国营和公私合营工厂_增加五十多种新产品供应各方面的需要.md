State-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private factories in Xi'an have added more than fifty new varieties to their product range this year. These include more than thirty kinds of industrial and construction equipment, four kinds of new-style agricultural implements, and more than ten kinds of daily-use industrial products.

These new varieties are all produced according to the needs of the local people and acceptance of orders from local or other places. In May of this year, the third mine of the Tongchuan Coal Mine in Shaanxi urgently needed a batch of shaft rings. The state-owned Northwest Mining Machinery Repair Factory promptly produced a batch for their use. Now, this factory has produced a batch of partial equipment for lifting, drainage, and air compression to supply the needs of Tongchuan Coal Mine's new pair of modern vertical shafts. The locally state-owned Xinhua Asbestos Factory accepted orders from Nanjing, Lushun-Dalian and other places this year and produced two new products: copper wire asbestos cloth and asbestos filter cloth. According to the needs of the electricity, construction, railway and other departments, the locally state-owned Xi'an Paint Manufacturing Factory has newly added more than ten kinds of special paints this year, such as anti-rust paint, acid-resistant paint, baking varnish insulation varnish, and high heat-resistant chimney paint.

The locally state-owned Northwest Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing Factory has newly added products this year, including horse-drawn harvesters, twelve-row seeders, medium-sized and small corn threshers. Most of the horse-drawn harvesters produced by this factory in the first half of the year have been shipped to Shaanxi, Gansu and other places in May to supply the needs of various state-owned farms and newly established agricultural producers' cooperatives. More than 1,000 corn threshers produced in July and August, except for 300 units that have been transported by the cooperative departments to farmers in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, the remaining 800 units will soon leave the factory to catch up with the corn harvesting season in these areas.

The joint state-private New Northwest Printing and Dyeing Factory has newly added eleven new products this year, including dark and light-colored Indanthrene cloth, light-colored An An blue cloth, light gray cloth, and printed fine twill cloth. The new patterns of printed cloth have also increased by more than thirty. Now, the factory workers are still rushing to produce a batch of serge products suitable for making autumn and winter clothing. The locally state-owned People's Enamel Factory has also added three new products this year, such as high-grade enamel anti-spill washbasins. The locally state-owned Xi'an Pharmaceutical Factory has produced a large quantity of the special product of the Northwest region, Angelica sinensis tablets, this year. These Angelica sinensis tablets are sold not only to various parts of the Northwest, but also to North China, Northeast China, Southwest China, Inner Mongolia and other regions. In May, 15 million tablets were exported abroad. (Xinhua News Agency)

    西安市国营、地方国营和公私合营工厂
    增加五十多种新产品供应各方面的需要
    西安市国营、地方国营和公私合营工厂今年生产的产品中，增加了五十多种新的品种。其中有三十多种工业和建筑器材、四种新式农具和十多种日用工业品。
    这些新品种都是根据当地人民需要和接受本地或外地订货生产的。今年五月份，陕西铜川煤矿第三矿井整修工程急需一批井圈，国营西北矿山机械修配厂就及时生产了一批供给他们使用。现在，这个工厂又生产了一批提升、排水、压气等设备的部分器材，供应铜川煤矿新建另一对现代化竖井的需要。地方国营新华石棉厂今年接受南京、旅大等地的订货，生产了铜丝石棉布和石棉过滤布等两种新产品。地方国营西安油漆制造厂根据电业、建筑、铁道等部门的需要，今年新增加了防锈漆、耐酸漆、烘光绝缘清漆、耐高热烟囱漆等十几种特种漆的品种。
    地方国营西北农业机械制造厂，今年新增加的产品有马拉收割机、十二行播种机、中型及小型玉米脱粒机等。这个厂上半年生产的一批马拉收割机大部分都已在五月间分别运往陕西、甘肃等地，供应各国营农场和新成立的农业生产合作社的需要。七、八月份生产的一千多部玉米脱粒机，除有三百部已由合作社部门运送给陕西、甘肃两省农民外，下余八百部也即将出厂，以赶上这些地区的玉米收获季节。
    公私合营新西北印染厂今年新增加了深、浅色士林布、浅色安安蓝布、浅灰布、印花细斜纹布等十一种新产品，花布新增的花样也有三十多种。现在，这个工厂的职工还在赶制一批适宜于做秋、冬季衣料的哔叽产品。地方国营人民搪瓷厂今年也增加了高级搪瓷品反口脸盆等三种新产品。地方国营西安制药厂今年大量地生产了西北区的特产药当归片。这些当归片除供应西北各地外，还行销华北、东北、西南、内蒙古等地区，五月份并有一千五百万粒输出国外。　（新华社）
