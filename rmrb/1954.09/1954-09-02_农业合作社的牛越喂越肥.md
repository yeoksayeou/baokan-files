    The cattle of the agricultural cooperative grow fatter and fatter.
    The twenty-four public oxen of the Renmocheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, are all fed plump and strong.
    The Renmocheng Agricultural Production Cooperative began as a trial in 1951. At that time, there were five public oxen in the cooperative. Because the collective spirit of the members was not high enough, and there was a lack of management experience, by the winter of 1952, four of the five oxen had become thin, and two of them even became ill. In the spring of 1953, with the help of the resident cadre, the cooperative's cadres studied and decided to hold a cattle competition, periodically gathering the oxen together for everyone to visit and evaluate. Through criticism and rewards, collective education was conducted for the feeders and all members. After education, the feeders cherished public property very much. Bao Zhuyin got up early and went to bed late every day to add grass to the oxen two or three times. The cattle ate fresh grass, and the bottom of the trough was often clean, without waste and the cattle were fed full. At the second cattle competition held last June, most of the oxen were well-fed. Bao Zhuyin, Cui Banghai, and other six feeders were selected as models. Since then, the cooperative has held a cattle competition every quarter. Up to now, all twenty-four oxen in the cooperative have been raised to be both fat and strong. As a result, the efficiency of cultivation has also increased. Last year, each ox only cultivated 72 mu of land, but this year it has increased to 83 mu, and the depth has also increased by one inch compared to last year. (Han Fuwang)

    农业合作社的牛越喂越肥
    山西武乡县任磨成农业生产合作社的二十四头公共耕牛，头头都喂得肥胖壮实。
    任磨成农业生产合作社是一九五一年开始试办的，当时社内有五头公共耕牛。由于社员集体主义思想还不够高，又加缺乏管理经验，到一九五二年冬天，五头牛瘦了四头，其中两头还生了病。一九五三年春天，在驻社干部帮助下，社的干部研究决定举行了牛赛会，定期把耕牛集中一起，让大家参观评比，通过批评和奖励，对饲养员和全体社员进行集体主义教育。饲养员经教育后，对于公共财产非常爱护，暴珠银每天都起早睡晚地给耕牛添两三次草料，牛吃着新鲜的草料，槽底经常是一清二净，既不浪费，又喂饱了牛。去年六月举行第二次牛赛会时，大部分耕牛都饲养得很好，暴珠银、崔榜孩等六个饲养员被评选为模范。从那以后，该社便每季举行一次牛赛会，到现在为止，全社二十四头耕牛，每头都养得既肥胖又壮实。因而耕作效率也随着提高，去年每头牛只耕地七十二亩，今年已增加到八十三亩，深度也比去年增加了一寸。（韩福旺）
