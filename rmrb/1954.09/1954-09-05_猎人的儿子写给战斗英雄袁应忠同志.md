    A Hunter's Son
    Writes to Combat Hero Yuan Yingzhong
    Gong Liu
    You are the son of the oppressed Lahu people, you are the son of a strong hunter, you are the son of the forest, you are the son of the mountains.
    The milk of pain nourished you, the despairing old man taught you marksmanship, fighting various fierce beasts, fighting the old society that was even more ferocious than beasts, this is your past life.
    You traveled the world with a question in your heart, you hoped to find someone who could answer it for you;—Why are we poor people subjected to such oppression? Where can we find a free and happy country?
    Only because the Communist Party came, could the truth shine like gold; you joined the People's Liberation Army and gripped your gun even tighter.
    You put on your grass-green uniform, and made the Kawa Mountains your home, going through water and fire, wholeheartedly for the border of the motherland.
    In one sniping battle, a bullet left the chamber, it showed: how much power hatred can become!
    You and your comrades killed all four bandits who crossed the border, adding new glory to your hunting record.
    Yuan Yingzhong—son of the people, let the hunter's blood surge more violently in your veins!
    All of China sees: a pillbox stands majestically above ten thousand mountains, and you are gazing forward, facing the gun hole…

    猎人的儿子
    写给战斗英雄袁应忠同志
    公刘你是受屈辱的拉祜族的儿子，你是强悍的猎人的儿子，你是森林的儿子，你是大山的儿子。痛苦的乳汁把你喂养大，绝望的老人传授你枪法，和各种凶残的野兽搏斗，和比野兽还凶残的旧社会搏斗，这就是你过去的生涯。你怀着一个问题走遍天下，你到处期望有谁能替你解答；——为什么我们穷人受尽欺压？到哪里能找到自由幸福的国家？只因为来了共产党，真理才能像金子一样发光；你参加了解放军，更加握紧你的枪。你换上了草绿军装，把佧佤山当作了自己的家乡，水里进，火里出，一心为了祖国边疆。一次狙击战，子弹出了膛，它显示了：仇恨能变成多么大的力量！你和你的战友把四个越境的匪徒全部打死，从此在你的狩猎纪录中又增添了新的荣光。袁应忠——人民的儿子，让猎人的血液在你的血管中更汹涌地激荡！全中国都看见：一个碉堡雄峙在万山之上，而你，正对着枪眼了望前方……
