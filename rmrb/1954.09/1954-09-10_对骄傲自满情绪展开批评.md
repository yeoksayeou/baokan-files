Newspaper Review:

    Criticizing Complacency and Arrogance

    The Xi'an Masses Daily, on August 24th, exposed the incident of Xingping County, Shaanxi Province, blindly renovating the city's appearance, and published an editorial that seriously criticized Zhang Qingshan, the county magistrate of Xingping County and a Communist Party member, who was primarily responsible for the incident, for his bourgeois individualism.

    Xingping County is a small city, and there is currently no industrial construction being carried out. According to our country's urban construction policy of "emphasizing key construction and advancing steadily," cities like this can only carry out general maintenance and repairs, and basically cannot carry out new construction. However, Comrade Zhang Qingshan, proceeding from the point of view of pursuing extravagance, disregarded the country's construction policy and the economic conditions of the masses, and without considering what construction should be carried out first to conform to the fundamental interests of the country and the people, arbitrarily adopted the opinions of the county's Federation of Industry and Commerce and decided to demolish and repair a large number of houses in the county seat, expand streets, and renovate the city's appearance. According to the newspaper report, from July of last year to May 4th of this year, more than 720 houses were demolished, of which only about 19 percent were in danger of collapsing and needed to be repaired or renovated, while the other houses should not have been demolished. During the process of renovating the city's appearance, although some working people expressed dissatisfaction and raised different opinions, Comrade Zhang Qingshan did not seriously consider or actively listen to them. On the contrary, the county government handed over the actual leadership responsibility for the renovation of the city's appearance to the Federation of Industry and Commerce, which resulted in serious phenomena of coercion and commandism. Precisely because Xingping County's decision to demolish and repair street houses on a large scale was not based on the needs of national construction, nor on the wishes of the local working people, and at the same time violated the Party's mass line in actual work, the result not only damaged the interests of the local masses, for example, some masses sold land, farm tools, carts, or borrowed usury to build houses, but also caused undue damage to the prestige of the Party and the people's government.

    The incident of Xingping County blindly renovating the city's appearance particularly exposed Comrade Zhang Qingshan's serious lack of organization and discipline. The newspaper pointed out that the issue of renovating the city's appearance had been submitted to the county People's Congress for discussion, and the meeting had not made a positive resolution. However, Comrade Zhang Qingshan, on such a major issue, neither asked for instructions from the higher-level leading organs nor discussed it at the county government's administrative meeting, but arbitrarily made a decision. At the same time, Comrade Zhang Qingshan is a member of the Communist Party of China and a member of the Xingping County Party Committee. According to the Party's organizational principles, when deciding on such a major issue that affects the vital interests of many people, it must be submitted to the Party Committee for discussion, but Comrade Zhang Qingshan did not do so. This shows that Comrade Zhang Qingshan's organizational concept is extremely weak, he replaced the organization with the individual, and replaced collective leadership with individual leadership, thereby undermining the principle of democratic centralism of the Party and state organs.

    The mistakes made by Comrade Zhang Qingshan in the work of renovating the city's appearance were not accidental. The newspaper emphasized in its editorial "Oppose Blind Construction and Unorganized and Undisciplined Behavior" that this is inseparable from his bourgeois individualism characterized by pride, complacency, and personal prominence. Comrade Zhang Qingshan participated in the revolution for a relatively long time, and since serving as the county magistrate of Xingping County, he has made certain achievements in agricultural production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the county under the leadership of the Party, and has been praised by higher authorities and Party newspapers. Comrade Zhang Qingshan did not regard this praise as a force to promote his own progress, but became arrogant and complacent. Therefore, in many places, he boasted and exaggerated his personal role, and on some major issues of principle, as long as he thought his opinion was correct, he would not abide by the principle of collective leadership of the Party and state organs and the system of requesting instructions and reporting, but would make decisions individually. However, as the editorial said, "Any arrogance, self-importance, highlighting the individual, disrespecting collective leadership, and placing the individual above the organization will inevitably lead to serious mistakes in work and cause losses to the cause of the Party and the people... Comrade Zhang Qingshan's blindly approving the renovation of Xingping County is an example."

    The incident exposed by the newspaper and the criticism of the incident will not only help people improve their understanding of the country's urban construction policy, but also help people more deeply understand the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party. Combining concrete and educational examples to criticize bourgeois individualism and expound the importance of strengthening Party unity and Party discipline is undoubtedly an effective method for our newspapers to deeply publicize the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session.

    对骄傲自满情绪展开批评
    西安群众日报在八月二十四日揭露了陕西兴平县盲目整修市容的事件，并发表社论，对这一事件的主要负责者兴平县人民政府县长、共产党员张青山的资产阶级个人主义思想进行了严肃的批判。
    兴平县是一个小城市，目前并不进行什么工业建设。按照我们国家“重点建设，稳步前进”的城市建设工作方针，像这样的城市只能进行一般的维护检修，基本上不可能进行新的建设。可是张青山同志却从好排场的观点出发，不考虑国家的建设方针和群众的经济条件，不考虑先建设什么才符合于国家和人民的根本利益，擅自采纳了该县工商业联合会的意见，决定大量拆修县城房屋，扩大街道，整修市容。据报纸报道，从去年七月到今年五月四日止，就先后拆除了七百二十多间房屋，其中除了约百分之十九左右的房屋有倒塌危险需要补修或翻修外，其他房屋都是不应当拆掉的。在整修市容过程中，虽曾有劳动人民表示不满和提出不同意见，但张青山同志并没有认真考虑和积极听取。相反地，该县人民政府却将整修市容的实际领导责任交给了工商业联合会，并因而产生了严重的强迫命令现象。正因为兴平县决定大量拆修街房并不是出于国家建设的需要，也不是出于当地劳动人民的愿望，同时在实际工作中又违背了党的群众路线，其结果不仅使当地群众的利益受到损害，例如有些群众就为了修建房屋而出卖土地、农具、大车或借高利贷，而且使党和人民政府的威信受到了不应有的损失。
    兴平县盲目整修市容的事件，特别暴露了张青山同志的严重无组织无纪律。报纸指出，这个整修市容问题，曾经提交县人民代表大会会议讨论，会议并没有做出肯定的决议。可是张青山同志在这样一个重大问题上，既没有向上级领导机关请示报告，又没有在县人民政府行政会议上进行讨论，就擅自做了决定。同时张青山同志是中国共产党党员、中共兴平县委会委员，根据党的组织原则，在决定这样一个关系许多群众切身利益的重大问题时，必须提交党委会讨论，可是张青山同志并没有这样做。这就说明了张青山同志的组织观念是极其薄弱的，他以个人代替了组织，以个人领导代替了集体领导，从而破坏了党和国家机关的民主集中制原则。
    张青山同志在整修市容工作中所犯的错误并不是偶然的。报纸在“反对盲目建设和无组织无纪律行为”的社论中着重指出，这是与他骄傲自满、个人突出的资产阶级个人主义思想分不开的。张青山同志参加革命较久，自担任兴平县县长以来，在党的领导下，在该县农业生产和互助合作运动上又做出了一定的成绩，曾经受到上级和党的报纸的表扬。张青山同志没有把这种表扬当作推动自己进步的力量，却骄傲自满起来，因而在许多地方吹嘘和夸大个人的作用，在一些原则性的重大问题上，只要自以为他的意见是对的，就不去遵守党和国家机关的集体领导原则和请示报告制度，而由个人决定。但是，正如社论所说，“任何骄傲自大，突出个人，不尊重集体领导，把个人摆在组织之上，都必定要在工作中犯严重错误，给党和人民的事业造成损失……。张青山同志盲目批准兴平县整修市容，便是一个例证。”
    报纸所揭发的这个事件以及对这个事件所进行的批判，不仅有助于人们提高对国家的城市建设方针的认识，而且有助于人们更深刻地领会党的七届四中全会决议的精神。结合具体的富有教育意义的事例来批判资产阶级个人主义思想，阐明加强党的团结和党的纪律的重要，无疑是我们报纸深入宣传四中全会决议的一个有效方法。         （钟怀）
