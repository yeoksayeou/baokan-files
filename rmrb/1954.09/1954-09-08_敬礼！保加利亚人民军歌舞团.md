    Salutations! The Song and Dance Ensemble of the Bulgarian People's Army
    Zhao Feng, Secretary-General of the Chinese Musicians Association

    The performances of the Song and Dance Ensemble of the Bulgarian People's Army, invited to visit our country under the Sino-Bulgarian Cultural Cooperation Agreement, have been warmly welcomed by the Chinese people and have achieved great success.
    The opening "Choral Dedication" of the song and dance evening – "Long Live the Unbreakable Friendship Between the Bulgarian and Chinese Peoples! Glory to Mao Zedong!" – this short Slavic-style song of praise displayed the choir's high artistic level: a broad and complete range, a powerful volume, moving dramatic effect, and perfect training and cooperation. The excellent performances of the choir conductor Prokopyev and soloists Todorov, Damyanov, Sheshemanova, Drumev, Arsov, Petrov, Popov, Yotsov, and Tsolov made every song receive repeated cheers from the audience.
    We are grateful not only that the choir and soloists sang our Chinese songs such as "People of the World Are of One Heart" in Chinese, but we are especially moved and it is worthy of our learning that Bulgarian composers have successfully adapted our folk songs. Peter Stuber's arrangement of "The East is Red" and Evgeny Komarov's arrangement of "Lan Hua Hua" show their diligent research on Chinese music and their brotherly enthusiasm for the Chinese people, as well as rich imagination and skillful technical accomplishment.
    The two soloists who sang "Lan Hua Hua," Todorov and Sheshemanova, dramatically performed this beautiful and passionate folk song, successfully portraying the experience and personality of an unrestrained and courageous woman; the high-pitched and powerful timbre of soloist Arsov's rendition of "Kangding Love Song" unfolded a picture of the plateau before our eyes; Tsolov's solo of the Soviet song "Distant Place" and Petrov's solo of the French opera "Carmen," the former's lyrical "falsetto" [Note] and the latter's bold emotions, gave the audience an extremely deep impression.
    It is hard to forget Yotsov's singing in Chinese of the Bulgarian folk song "Reckless Young Man," adapted by Asen Karastoyanov. The translated poetry and melody are so closely matched that Chinese listeners would simply think this is music written based on Chinese poetry:
    Mother asked me to go to the watermelon field,
    Mother asked me to go to the watermelon field,
    Suddenly there was a crazy young man,
    Grabbing the sash on my body and not letting go.
    He pulls me, he pulls me,
    He doesn't let go, I don't let go,
    He goes there, I go here.
    My God, the sash is broken,
    Oh, the sash is broken.
    That crazy young man still doesn't listen.
    ……………
    The witty poetry displays a cheerful and optimistic side of the Bulgarian people's character, and like all other programs, the cooperation between the soloists and the choir has reached an extremely perfect level.
    The creations of Bulgarian Meritorious Artist and Dimitrov Prize winner Asen Karastoyanov demonstrate versatile talent. His adaptation of the Bulgarian folk song "Golden Apple Tree, Ah!" describes the lover’s ardent desire and pure love in a joyful allegro; lovers ask the golden apple tree to always protect their love, just as the old oak tree always protects the gentle poplar tree.
    "Bulgarian Folk Dance" expresses the moving character of the Bulgarian people: passionate and kind. Young men and women dance at an astonishingly fast pace; two young men quarrel over a girl, but they do not swing their fists, but dance together fervently again. The dance drama "September 1923 and September 1944" depicts the brave character and indomitable struggle of the Bulgarian people. Thanks to director Hristo Tsonev's "Chinese Dance," the steps of the Yangko, waist drum, and red ribbon dance are filled with the friendship between the Bulgarian and Chinese peoples, as close as brothers and sisters.
    The Bulgarian People's Army Song and Dance Ensemble's outstanding artistic achievements have been awarded the People's Republic of Bulgaria's "Ninth of September Medal." This visit and performance in our country, we firmly believe, will make a valuable contribution to promoting the Chinese people's understanding of the Bulgarian people and further strengthening the friendship between the two peoples of China and Bulgaria. And their achievements in performing arts and musical creation, especially their attainments in vocal music and choral art, and their bold creation in adapting folk songs that dare to break through the original pattern, should become a model and goal for Chinese musicians to learn from and strive for.
    [Note] Falsetto is a technique used by European singers to sing high notes, and the sound produced by this singing method has a sweet quality.

### 敬礼！保加利亚人民军歌舞团

    敬礼！保加利亚人民军歌舞团
    中国音乐家协会秘书长　赵沨
    根据中保文化合作协定，应邀来我国访问的保加利亚人民军歌舞团的演出，受到我国人民热烈的欢迎，获得了很大的成功。
    歌舞晚会开幕的“合唱献辞”——“保中两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！光荣属于毛泽东！”这一首短短的斯拉夫风颂歌体合唱，便显示了合唱团的高度的艺术水平：广阔而完整的音域，强大的音量，动人的戏剧性的效果和完美的训练与合作。合唱团指挥普罗科彼耶夫和独唱家托多洛夫、达米扬诺夫、舍舍满诺娃、得鲁麦夫、阿尔索夫、彼特洛夫、波波夫、约曹夫、曹洛夫等卓越的、出色的表演，使每一首歌曲都受到观众一再的欢呼。
    使我们感谢的不仅是合唱团和独唱家们用中国语言唱了我国的歌曲“全世界人民心一条”等，特别使我们感动并且值得我们学习的是保加利亚的作曲家们把我国民歌作了成功的加工。彼得尔·司都贝尔改编的“东方红”和埃夫盖尼·柯马洛夫改编的“蓝花花”，显示了他们对中国音乐辛勤的研究和对中国人民的兄弟般的热情、丰富的想像力和得心应手的技术修养。
    演唱“蓝花花”的两位独唱家，托多洛夫和舍舍满诺娃，戏剧化地表演了这首美丽、热情的民歌，成功地刻划了一个奔放、勇敢的女性的经历和个性；独唱家阿尔索夫演唱的“康定情歌”，高亢有力的音色使我们眼前展开了一幅高原的图画；曹洛夫独唱的苏联歌曲“遥远的地方”和彼特洛夫独唱的法国歌剧“卡门”选曲，前者的抒情的“假声”〔注〕和后者的豪放的感情，给予观众以极其深刻的印象。
    使人难以忘记的是独唱家约曹夫用中文演唱的阿森·卡拉斯托扬诺夫改编的保加利亚民歌
  “鲁莽的小伙子”。译诗和曲调是那么吻合，中国听众简直会以为这是根据中国诗歌写的音乐：
    妈妈让我去到西瓜地里，
    妈妈让我去到西瓜地里，
    忽然间有个疯癫癫的小伙子，
    抓住我身上的腰带不放。
    他拉我拉，他拉我拉，
    他不放，我不放，
    他往那儿，我往这儿。
    我的妈哟，腰带断了，
    嗳哟，腰带断了。
    他那疯癫癫的小伙子哟还不听说。
    ……………
    有风趣的诗歌显示了保加利亚人民性格中愉快和乐天的一面，和其他所有的节目一样，独唱家和合唱团的合作达到了极为完美的地步。
    保加利亚功勋艺术家、季米特洛夫奖金获得者阿森·卡拉斯托扬诺夫的创作，显示了多方面的才能。他根据保加利亚民歌改编的“金色的苹果树呵！”欢愉的快板描写了恋人的热望和纯真的爱情；爱人们要求金色的苹果树永远保护着他们的爱情，像那老橡树永远保护着温柔的白杨树一样。
    “保加利亚民间舞”表现了保加利亚人民动人的性格：热情而善良。青年男女们以惊人的快速的节奏舞蹈着，两个小伙子为一个姑娘争吵起来了，但他们没有挥动拳头，却又一起狂热的舞起来了。舞剧“一九二三年九月与一九四四年九月”描写了保加利亚人民勇敢的性格和不屈的斗争。感谢赫里斯托·曹奈夫导演的“中国舞”，秧歌、腰鼓和红绸舞的步伐中洋溢着保加利亚人民和中国人民亲如手足的友情。
    保加利亚人民军歌舞团在艺术上的卓越成就，获得保加利亚人民共和国“九月九日勋章”的崇高褒奖。这一次在我国的访问和演出，我们深信，将对促进中国人民对保加利亚人民的了解，和进一步加强中保两国人民的友好作出宝贵的贡献。而他们在表演艺术和音乐创作上的成就，特别是在声乐和合唱艺术上的造诣和改编民歌上敢突破原有格局的大胆创造，应该成为我国音乐工作者学习的榜样和努力的目标。
    〔注〕假声，是欧洲歌唱家唱高音时的一种技巧，用这种唱法唱
          出的声音具有一种甘美的性质。
