(Shanghai Jiefang Daily Dispatch, September 5th) Shanghai's extensive publicity and discussion of the Draft Constitution has concluded, basically achieving universal awareness. According to incomplete statistics, 2.7 million people in the city heard reports on the Draft Constitution, of which 1.56 million enthusiastically participated in the discussions. Based on original material statistics, people from all walks of life in Shanghai put forward more than 165,000 revisions and supplementary opinions on the structure, content of articles, grammar, and rhetoric of the Draft Constitution during the discussions. These opinions have been sorted out by the Shanghai Draft Constitution Discussion Committee and successively submitted to the Drafting Committee of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China.

Through publicity and discussion, people from all walks of life have generally gained a further understanding of the significance of formulating a constitution, the basic spirit and main content of the Draft Constitution, and expressed their heartfelt support. Workers said: "Who is in charge, who makes the law. The Draft Constitution reflects the will of our working class and the people of the whole country. With the People's Constitution, building a socialist society is more secure." Government cadres further recognized the role of our country's constitution in establishing and consolidating the socialist economic base and eliminating the system of exploitation. They expressed their determination to take the lead in abiding by the law, be loyal to the people's democratic system, and strive to serve the people. Some housewives said: The constitution is like the general rules of a large family of the people of the whole country. As a member of this large family, we must understand the general rules of the large family in order to manage the family well.

In mid-August, people from all walks of life in Shanghai used various forms to launch a chapter-by-chapter, article-by-article discussion of the Draft Constitution, and actively put forward revisions and supplementary opinions in the spirit of being masters of their own affairs. In factories and enterprises, in addition to holding group discussions, the articles of the Draft Constitution were explained one by one through blackboards and wired broadcasting stations. The workers proposed to "look carefully (at the Draft Constitution), listen carefully (to the explanation), raise opinions if there are any, and ask questions if there are any." As long as there were revisions and supplementary opinions, they would "write if they could write, and speak if they could not write," and fully express their opinions. The workers said: Discussing the Draft Constitution is exercising the working class's right to be masters of their own affairs. In order to build a socialist society, every sentence and every word of the Draft Constitution must be carefully considered to make the Draft Constitution more perfect. Factories belonging to the Shanghai heavy industry, light industry, textile industry, and other industrial systems, almost every production group put forward many opinions and questions. Employees of the state-owned commercial system have initially submitted more than 1,000 revisions and questions. Employees of the Putuo District Tianyi Printing and Dyeing Factory put forward more than 280 revisions, and shop assistants in Huangpu District put forward more than 200 revisions. The workers of the joint state-private Kefa Pharmaceutical Factory carefully read the Draft Constitution before the discussion. The workers of the first workshop discussed the Draft Constitution article by article in groups and put forward 171 revisions and eight questions. When worker Wang Zhenfang participated in the first discussion, he put forward five opinions. The next day, he carefully read the Draft Constitution again during his rest day and put forward seventeen more revisions. Worker Qiu Guoying put forward twenty-two opinions one after another. Zhang Lin, a female worker in this factory, once could not participate in the discussion due to her child's sudden illness, and entrusted another worker to put forward her opinion on her behalf. In late August, when Shanghai citizens were carrying out the most intense flood and typhoon prevention work, employees of the Shanghai State-owned Commercial Storage Company, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Public Works Bureau, and the Shanghai Port Authority of the Ministry of Transport of the Central People's Government still insisted on discussions. The ditch workers of the seven public works offices under the Public Works Bureau dredged the dark ditches at night, and continued to discuss the Draft Constitution as soon as the tide receded in the morning. From August 20th to 24th, the employees of the Public Works Bureau put forward 8,400 revisions and supplementary opinions in four days. Many workers from Shanghai Iron and Steel Company Factory No. 1 and No. 2, Qiuxin Shipyard and other factories suggested adding "All mines, underground resources, railways, air transportation, deserts, mountains, fish, and underground ancient cultural relics are owned by the whole people" to Article 6 of the Draft Constitution. Many employees of the state-owned Shanghai No. 2 Textile Machinery Factory and Shanghai Xinhua Printing Factory suggested incorporating "obeying the national plan" and "encouraging the completion of the national plan" as citizens' obligations into the Constitution. In the opinions put forward by people from all walks of life, many opinions suggested changing "houses" in Article 11 of the Draft Constitution to "private residences" to prevent some capitalists in Shanghai from withdrawing production funds, buying houses, and using houses for illegal speculative activities. In the discussion, the suburban farmers linked the leading role of the working class and the further consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance. Many people suggested changing "surrounded by ears of grain and gears" in Article 105 of the Draft Constitution to "surrounded by gears and ears of grain," putting the "gears" symbolizing the leadership of the working class in the front. The Geography Department and History Department groups of East China Normal University suggested stipulating the specifications of the national flag and national emblem in the Constitution. Chen Peizhen of Shanghai Xinhua Printing Factory suggested changing "citizens who have reached the age of eighteen" in Article 86 of the Draft Constitution to "citizens who have reached the age of eighteen." The Political Economy Group of Tongji University suggested adding the clause "All foreign nationals must abide by the laws of the People's Republic of China" to the Constitution. Qin Guowei, who lives in Lane 288, Zhoujiazui Road, Shanghai, is a middle school student who is not yet old enough to vote. In his letter to the Shanghai Draft Constitution Discussion Committee, he suggested changing Article 94 of the Draft Constitution, "The state pays special attention to the physical and intellectual development of young people" to "The state pays special attention to the physical and intellectual development of young people and children"; and many young people suggested adding "The state pays special attention to the development of the moral education (communist moral character) of young people and children" to this article.

Through the publicity and discussion of the Draft Constitution, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of the people has been greatly improved, and their consciousness of working hard and obeying the national plan for the construction of socialist society has been further enhanced. Many people said that we must plant trees before we can enjoy the shade, and we must dig wells before we can drink water. Rights and obligations are consistent. Therefore, in the past two months, people have shown a high degree of socialist labor enthusiasm everywhere in production and work. Now, the broad masses of the people in Shanghai are continuing to carry their surging political enthusiasm into production, work and study, and are taking practical actions to welcome the convening of the First National People's Congress and the birth of the first constitution of the People's Republic of China.

    上海市一百五十多万人热烈讨论宪法草案
    提出补充和修改意见十六万条
    【上海解放日报五日专电】上海市大张旗鼓地宣传和讨论宪法草案已告结束，基本上达到了家喻户晓；根据不完全统计，全市有二百七十万人听到有关宪法草案的报告，其中有一百五十六万人热烈地参加了讨论。根据原始材料统计，上海市各界人民在讨论中对宪法草案结构、条文内容以及语法修辞，共提出十六万五千多条修改和补充意见。这些意见，已由上海市宪法草案讨论委员会加以整理，陆续汇交中华人民共和国宪法起草委员会。
    通过宣传和讨论，各界人民对于制定宪法的意义、宪法草案的基本精神和主要内容，普遍有了进一步的认识，并表示衷心拥护。工人们说：“啥人当家，啥人立法，宪法草案反映了我们工人阶级和全国人民的意志。有了人民的宪法，建设社会主义社会更牢靠了。”机关干部进一步认识了我国的宪法对于建立和巩固社会主义经济基础和消灭剥削制度的作用，他们表示要以身作则地遵守法律，效忠人民民主制度，努力为人民服务。有些家庭妇女说：宪法好比是全国人民大家庭的总规章，我们作为这个大家庭的一员，必须懂得大家庭的总规章，才可以当好家。
    八月中旬，上海市各界人民利用各种各样的形式，展开了对宪法草案逐章逐条的讨论，以当家作主的精神，积极提出修改和补充意见。在工厂企业单位，除了举行小组讨论外，还通过黑板报、有线广播台，逐条讲解宪法草案的条文。工人们提出要
  “仔细看（宪法草案），仔细听（讲解），有意见就提，有疑问就问”。只要有修改和补充意见，就
  “能写的就写，不能写的就讲”，把意见充分提出来。工人们说：讨论宪法草案是行使工人阶级当家作主的权利。为了建设社会主义社会，对宪法草案的每一句、每一字都要考虑周到，把宪法草案修改得更加完善。上海重工业、轻工业、纺织工业等产业系统所属各工厂，差不多每个生产小组都提出许多意见和问题。国营商业系统职工，提出的修改意见和问题，初步统计已有一千多条。普陀区天一印染厂职工提出二百八十多条修改意见，黄浦区的店员提出了二百多条修改意见。公私合营科发药厂的工人们在讨论前都仔细地读了宪法草案，第一车间工人分组逐条讨论宪法草案，提出一百七十一条修改意见和八个问题。工人王振芳在参加第一次讨论时，就提出了五条意见，第二天，他利用休息日又仔细地读了一遍宪法草案，又提出十七条修改意见。工人邱帼英一人先后提出了二十二条意见。这个厂里的女工张琳，有一次因孩子患急病不能参加讨论，也把自己的一条意见托别的工人代提。八月下旬，正是上海市民进行防汛防台工作最紧张的时
  期，上海市国营商业仓储公司、上海市人民政府工
  务局、中央人民政府交通部上海区港务管理局的职
  工仍然坚持讨论。工务局所属全市七个工务所的通
  沟工人，晚上疏浚阴沟，一待早晨退潮后，就继续进行宪法草案的讨论。从八月二十日到二十四日的
  四天内，工务局的职工提出了修改和补充意见八千
  四百条。上海钢铁公司一厂、二厂，求新造船厂等
  厂，有许多工人建议在宪法草案第六条中，增加
  “凡矿山、地下蕴藏、铁道、航空运输、沙漠、山陵、鱼类以及地下古代文化遗物，都属全民所有”
  的内容。国营上海第二纺织机械厂、上海新华印刷厂许多职工建议把“服从国家计划”、“鼓励完成国家计划”，作为公民的义务，订进宪法中去。在各界人民提出的意见中，有许多意见都建议把宪法草案第十一条的“房屋”改为“私人住宅”，以杜绝目前上海有些资本家抽逃生产资金、买进房屋，并利用房屋进行投机的非法活动。郊区农民在讨论中联系到工人阶级领导和进一步巩固工农联盟的作用，有许多人建议，把宪法草案第一百零五条中的
  “周围是谷穗和齿轮”，改为“周围是齿轮和谷穗”，把象征工人阶级领导的“齿轮”放在前面。华东师范大学地理系、历史系小组，建议在宪法中规定国旗和国徽的规格。上海新华印刷厂陈佩珍建议把宪法草案第八十六条中“年满十八岁的公民”，改为“年满十八周岁的公民”。同济大学政治经济学小组建议在宪法中增加“一切外国侨民必须遵守中华人民共和国法律”的条文。上海俄文专科学校的同学，建议在宪法草案第十四条中，增加“国家禁止任何人利用任何手段破坏公共利益的行为”的内容。住在上海市周家嘴路二百八十八弄的秦国伟，是一个尚不够选民年龄的中学生，他在写给上海市宪法草案讨论委员会的信中，建议把宪法草案第九十四条“国家特别关怀青年的体力和智力的发展”，改为“国家特别关怀青年、少年的体力和智力的发展”；还有许多青年，建议在这条中，增加“国家特别关怀青年、少年德育（共产主义道德品质）的发展”的内容。
    经过宪法草案的宣传和讨论，广大人民的社会主义觉悟大大提高，进一步提高了为建设社会主义社会而艰苦奋斗、服从国家计划的自觉性。许多人说，我们要遮荫就得先栽树，要喝水就得先掘井，权利和义务是一致的。因此近两个月来，人们在生产上和工作上，到处表现出高涨的社会主义劳动热情。现在，上海市广大人民正在继续把高涨的政治热情贯穿到生产、工作和学习中去，以实际行动迎接第一届全国人民代表大会会议的召开和中华人民共和国第一个宪法的诞生。
