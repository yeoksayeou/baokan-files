Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, September 3rd: Mangunsarkoro, Second Vice Chairman of the Indonesian Nationalist Party, recently told a "Newsweek" reporter that communist countries have shown their foreign policy, which reflects the possibility of maintaining peace; and the plans of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization once again expose the intention of imperialist countries to plan future wars. He said that the establishment of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization can only aggravate the tense situation in Southeast Asia. Imperialist countries also intend to manipulate the fate of Asian countries through the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in order to maintain their colonial rule. In the eyes of the Asian people, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization reflects a new form of foreign colonialists ruling Southeast Asian countries. Mangunsarkoro demanded that Indonesia more actively establish friendly relations with the people of Asian countries on the basis of peace.

Jakarta's "Independent Daily" quoted political observers as saying that because the Colombo Conference countries refused to participate in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, a military bloc, the upcoming Southeast Asia Treaty Organization conference is doomed to failure. The Asian countries participating in this conference are Thailand and the Philippines. Among the Colombo Conference countries, only Pakistan sent people to attend the conference, and these countries are all militarily related to the United States. The newspaper also quoted political observers as saying that although the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization conference may also discuss economic assistance, it will not attract India and Indonesia.

Xinhua News Agency, September 2nd: According to a report in the Australian "Guardian" on August 26th, Australian Labor Party member Whitlam recently advocated that the Australian government adopt a realistic foreign policy in a foreign policy debate.

Whitlam said: "We must live with our neighbors, and the policy advocated by the United States is completely contrary to the policy advocated and acted upon by our neighbors."

When he talked about the attitude of Australia's neighbors towards the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, he said: India has resolutely rejected it, and so have Indonesia, Burma, and Ceylon. If the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is to have any effect, it must be able to represent Southeast Asia, but if only the Philippines and Thailand participate, then it cannot be said to represent Southeast Asia. Whitlam said: "Our participation in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is just fooling ourselves."

When Whitlam talked about the China issue, he said: We must face the fact that Southeast Asian countries do not think that China is hostile to them. We have not only adopted an unrealistic view, but also created a threat to peace in Asia. In view of the fact that our neighbors and Britain have recognized China, it is now time for us to recognize China.

    印度尼西亚国民党第二副主席指出
    东南亚集团是殖民国家统治东南亚的新形式
    澳大利亚一位工党议员主张澳政府采取现实的外交政策
      【新华社雅加达三日电】印度尼西亚国民党第二副主席曼贡萨科罗最近告“新闻周刊”记者说，共产党国家已表明了它们的外交政策，这一政策反映着维护和平的可能性；而东南亚公约组织的计划再次暴露了帝国主义国家策划未来的战争的意图。他说，成立东南亚公约组织，只能使东南亚的紧张局势更加恶化。帝国主义国家并打算通过东南亚公约组织来摆布亚洲国家的命运，以保持它们的殖民统治。在亚洲人民的眼中，东南亚公约组织反映着外国殖民者统治东南亚国家的新形式。曼贡萨科罗要求印度尼西亚更主动地在和平的基础上和亚洲各国人民建立友好关系。
    雅加达“独立报”引述政治观察家的话说，由于科伦坡会议国家拒绝参加东南亚公约组织这个军事集团，将要召开的东南亚公约组织会议已注定要归于失败。参加这个会议的亚洲国家有泰国和菲律宾，科伦坡会议国家中派人出席会议的只有巴基斯坦一国，这些国家全都在军事上和美国有关系。报纸又引述政治观察家的话说，虽然东南亚公约组织会议也可能讨论经济援助，但是它将吸引不动印度和印度尼西亚。
    【新华社二日讯】据澳大利亚“卫报”八月二十六日报道，澳大利亚工党议员惠特拉姆最近在外交辩论中，主张澳大利亚政府采取现实的外交政策。
    惠特拉姆说：“我们必须和我们的邻国共处，美国所主张的政策是完全和我们的邻国所主张和据以行动的政策相违背的。”
    他谈到澳大利亚的邻国对东南亚公约组织的态度时说：印度已经断然拒绝了它，印度尼西亚、缅甸和锡兰也是这样。如果东南亚公约组织要有任何效力的话，它必须要能代表东南亚，但是如果只有菲律宾和泰国参加的话，那就不能说它是代表东南亚的。惠特拉姆说：“我们参加东南亚公约组织只是在哄骗自己而已。”
    惠特拉姆谈到中国问题时说：我们必须面对这样的事实：东南亚各国并不认为中国对它们有敌意。我们不仅采取了非现实的看法，而且还造成对于亚洲和平的威胁。鉴于我们的邻国以及英国都已承认中国，现在是到了我们承认中国的时候了。
