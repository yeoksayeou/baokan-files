    Jiangsu Province's Agricultural Production Cooperatives have generally achieved a bumper harvest of early autumn crops, concretely demonstrating the superiority of unified management and collective labor in agricultural production cooperatives.
    In Gaoyou County, the early rice yield of twenty agricultural production cooperatives generally exceeded the original planned targets, surpassing the yield of surrounding mutual aid teams and individual farmers. For example, the Putuan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hengjing District, which is located in a low-lying area and prone to waterlogging, achieved an average yield of 500 jin per mu of early rice after successively overcoming several floods. The Yang Youshan mutual aid team, which had a high yield outside the cooperative, harvested 450 jin per mu, 50 jin less than the cooperative. Chen Youlin, an individual farmer with sufficient capital, farm tools, and cattle, harvested 397 jin per mu, 103 jin less than the cooperative. In Donghai County, early corn production increased significantly over a large area, with an average yield of 165 jin per mu across the county, exceeding the original planned yield by more than 20%. The yield of the county's 54 agricultural production cooperatives was generally higher than that of farmers outside the cooperatives. The 111 mu of early corn in the Da Dingwang Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Seventh District yielded an average of 300 jin per mu, nearly double the county average. The First Agricultural Production Cooperative of Hengtang Township, Erling District, Danyang County, vigorously increased the production of oil crops this year. The 645 mu of early soybeans achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest, averaging 160 jin per mu, double the yield of last year (due to drought last year, production was reduced), and more than 10% higher than that of farmers outside the cooperative.
    The general bumper harvest of early autumn crops in cooperatives is mainly due to unified management, collective labor, facilitating intensive cultivation, improving technology, and resisting natural disasters. The bumper harvest of early autumn crops in agricultural cooperatives has once again demonstrated their superiority to farmers with facts, attracting many farmers outside the cooperatives to request membership, and many mutual aid teams are actively preparing to establish cooperatives.

    The spring-planted soybeans in Guangdong Province have now been harvested, and most areas have achieved a bumper harvest. According to preliminary statistics, the province's soybean production has increased by more than 300,000 shi dan compared to last year.
    This year, many farmers in various regions, in addition to planting soybeans on dry land, also utilized the open spaces in front of and behind their houses for planting. The province's spring-planted soybean area expanded by approximately 119,000 mu compared to last year. In Suixi County, many districts and townships expanded their planting area by more than double compared to last year. Zengcheng County planted more than 12,600 mu of spring soybeans, most of which yielded more than 30% more than the same period last year. The Guangming Agricultural Production Cooperative in Heyuan County also planted soybeans on idle seedling fields this year. One mu and one fen of land were sown early at the vernal equinox and fertilized with ash, and now one shi and four dou of soybeans have been harvested, more than double the yield of previous years. In Meixian County, located in a mountainous area, approximately 10,800 mu of spring soybeans were planted, with an average yield of 140 jin per mu, more than double the yield of last year.
    After harvesting soybeans, farmers in various regions have actively sold their soybeans to the state in accordance with pre-purchase contracts, and many farmers have sold even more soybeans than the originally agreed pre-sale figures.

    江苏省各地农业生产合作社早秋作物丰收
    广东省黄豆丰收产量比去年增加三十万担
    江苏省各地农业生产合作社早秋作物普遍丰收，具体地显示了农业生产合作社统一经营、集体劳动的优越性。
    高邮县二十个农业生产合作社，一般早稻产量都超过原订计划，比周围互助组和单干农民产量高。如横泾区地势低洼，受涝较严重的普团农业生产合作社，连续战胜数次涝灾以后，早稻平均每亩收五百斤；社外产量高的杨友山互助组每亩收四百五十斤，比合作社少收五十斤；农本足、耕牛农具齐全的单干农民陈有林家每亩收三百九十七斤，比合作社少收一百零三斤。东海县早玉米获大面积增产，全县平均每亩产量一百六十五斤，超过原计划产量二成以上，全县五十四个农业生产合作社的产量，又普遍高过社外农民，七区大丁旺农业生产合作社的一百十一亩早玉米，每亩平均产量三百斤，超过全县平均产量近一倍。丹阳县珥陵区横塘乡第一农业生产合作社今年大力增产油料作物，六百四十五亩早黄豆全面丰收，平均每亩一百六十斤，比去年增产一倍（去年因旱减产），比社外农民增产一成以上。
    合作社早秋作物的普遍丰收，主要由于统一经营、集体劳动、便于精耕细作、改进技术和抗拒自然灾害的结果。农业社早秋作物丰收，又一次用事实向农民显示了优越性，吸引社外很多农民要求入社，并有很多互助组积极准备建社。

    广东省今春种植的黄豆现已收获完毕，大部分地区均获得丰收，据初步统计，全省黄豆比去年增产三十万市担以上。
    今年各地很多农民除了在旱地上种植黄豆外，还利用屋宅前后的空地种植。全省春植黄豆面积比去年扩大约十一万九千多亩。遂溪县不少区、乡比去年扩大种植面积一倍以上。增城县春植黄豆一万二千六百多亩，大部分比去年同期增产三成以上。河源县光明农业生产合作社今年把休闲的秧地也种上了黄豆；有一亩一分田提早在春分播种，施上草木灰，现收到黄豆一石四斗，比往年增产两倍多。地处山区的梅县，春植黄豆约一万零八百亩，每亩平均产量一百四十斤，比去年增产一倍。
    各地农民收获黄豆后，纷纷按照预购合同将黄豆卖给国家，许多农民出售黄豆数量还超过原订预售数字。
