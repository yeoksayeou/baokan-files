    A Day in Shanhuzhen Village
    The sun was still hiding behind the old Eagle Mountain to the east, and the sky was just barely light when the loud voice of the "local broadcast" rang out from the over two-zhang-tall broadcasting platform in front of the square in Shanhuzhen Village, Zhuji County, Zhejiang Province: "Farmers, overfulfill the grain production increase plan, support national industrial construction, support the people in disaster areas, and support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan!"
    That was the morning of August 12th. The members of the Xijiang First Agricultural Production Cooperative got up the earliest, and in the faint morning light, more than a hundred members rushed to the rice fields to begin a happy day of labor. Following them, mutual aid teams and individual farmers also went to the fields one after another to begin production.
    Facing the rising sun, Zhan Deqiao, the deputy director of the Xijiang First Agricultural Production Cooperative, took me to visit the fields. He pointed to the "Increased Production Signs" in the fields and told me: "After the members heard the Provincial Party Committee's call to increase grain production beyond the plan, they were very excited. All four production brigades and twelve production teams of the cooperative held emergency meetings and repeatedly studied each field, found different methods to increase production, set targets for exceeding the planned increase, and then wrote them on the signs and inserted them here." The members of the agricultural production cooperative have great confidence in increasing production, believing that although the more than 360 mu of early rice in the cooperative have already been harvested and there is no way to make up for it, by plowing the 780 mu of single-season late rice and 400 mu of double-season late rice fields one more time and applying fertilizer one more time, they are confident that they can harvest an additional twenty jin of rice per mu. In addition, by harvesting carefully and protecting the crops as much as possible, they can harvest an additional ten jin per mu. In that case, the more than 1,100 mu of fields in the cooperative can yield more than 35,000 jin of rice.
    We stood on the high embankment of the Fengqiao River in front of the village, looking at the green rice fields in front of us, with rice seedlings already one or two chi high. The farmers were squatting in the rice fields weeding, removing grass, or bending over the waterwheel frame to draw water. Zhan Deqiao said with a smile: "You might not believe it, but we were recently a disaster area here." It turned out that it had rained continuously for more than fifty days in May and June, and the river water rose to the same level as the embankment. The members of the Xijiang First Agricultural Production Cooperative fought against the flood for more than forty days, building a dike more than three li long to hold back the flood. More than seventy waterwheels pumped water day and night to eliminate internal waterlogging. As a result, they finally protected more than 360 mu of early rice south of the river and rice seedlings enough to plant more than 1,000 mu of fields. Although the more than 700 mu of early rice north of the river suffered flooding and loss, after several drainages and replantings, they finally planted all the late rice. This is a region prone to both flooding and drought. It hasn't rained for more than ten days, and drought has begun to appear. Now the cooperative has organized four cattle-powered waterwheels and more than thirty waterwheels to pump water to irrigate the fields, ensuring that no field lacks water. Part of the fertilizer powder and lime has already been bought, and the women have also decided to increase the accumulation of soil fertilizer. After plowing the fields a second time the day after tomorrow, they will apply fertilizer. Zhan Deqiao said: "Our rice must increase production by 13 percent on the basis of last year's bumper harvest. No natural disaster can scare us. Let the heavens see the power of our organization."
    On the hillside behind the village, a women's army was also working hard. The female brigade deputy of the four production brigades of the Xijiang First Agricultural Production Cooperative led more than thirty women, braving the scorching sun, part of them weeding in the sweet potato fields, and the other part excavating cornfields. The previous two days, the women also held a meeting and made a plan: resolutely eliminate empty land, use hillsides, field ridges, and gaps around houses, plant one hundred corn plants per household, a total of 10,800 plants for all 108 households in the cooperative. In addition, they will interplant 10,000 corn plants in the cooperative's 200,000 sweet potato plants, and use empty land to plant two dou of soybeans. Today, the women came to the mountain early in the morning, and everyone was excited, digging or weeding. Fifty-one-year-old He Xiufeng picked up two baskets of pig manure early in the morning and rushed to the mountain to join the digging. Sixty-eight-year-old Yao Acui climbed the mountain and pulled 1,500 weeds beside the sweet potato vines in one breath, without feeling tired.
    The sun set behind the western mountains, and the beautiful Shanhuzhen Village was slowly covered in a layer of twilight. The farmers returned to the village in twos and threes. After dinner, the members of the Xijiang First Agricultural Production Cooperative summarized the day's achievements: 137 male laborers plowed 147 mu of fields and pumped water for 274 mu, exceeding the normal workload by about 20 percent. Thirty-six women excavated 72 corn ridges and removed 82,000 weeds beside sweet potato vines. Under the leadership of the cooperative, mutual aid teams and individual farmers in the village also did more work than usual. The Zhan Qisheng mutual aid team has opened up more than two fen of empty land on the hillside and planted more than 300 corn plants.

### 山下湖村的一天

    山下湖村的一天
    新华社记者　杨树棠
    太阳还躲在东边老鹰山后，天还只有麻麻亮，浙江省诸暨县山下湖村前广场上二丈多高的广播台上，便响起了“土广播”嘹亮的声音：“农友们，超额完成粮食增产计划，支援国家工业建设，支援灾区人民，支援人民解放军解放台湾。”
    那是八月十二日早晨。西江第一农业生产合作社的社员们起来得最早，在晨光曦微中，一百多个社员匆匆赶到稻田里，开始了一天愉快的劳动。接着，互助组和单干农民也都陆续下田生产了。
    迎着初升的太阳，西江第一农业生产合作社副社长詹德乔带着我到田间参观。他指着田头一块一块“增产牌”告诉我：“社员们听见省委超额增产粮食的号召后，都很兴奋，全社四个生产大队和十二个生产小组都开了紧急会议，把每丘田都反复地进行了研究，找出了各种不同的增产办法，定出超额增产的指标，然后写在牌子上插在这里。”农业生产合作社社员的增产信心都很大，认为现在虽然全社三百六十多亩早稻已经收割，没有办法补救，但是在七百八十多亩单季晚稻和四百亩双季晚稻田里，加耘一遍田和多施一次肥，每亩多打二十斤稻谷是有把握的，再加上收割时细收细打，尽量爱护，每亩又可以多收十斤，那么全社一千一百多亩田就可以多收三万五千多斤稻谷了。
    我们站在村前枫桥江的高堤上，看面前稻田里一片碧绿，稻苗已有一、二尺高了。农民们正蹲在稻田里耘田、除草或弯着腰在水车架上车水。詹德乔笑着对我说：“说来你怕不信，我们这里不久以前还是灾区呢。”原来这里在五、六月间曾连续下了五十多天大雨，江水涨得和堤岸一样平，西江第一农业生产合作社社员们和洪水搏斗了四十多天，筑起一条三里多长的堤坝，挡住了洪水。七十多部水车日夜不停地排除内涝，结果终于保住了江的南面三百六十多亩早稻和可插一千多亩田的稻秧，江的北面七百多亩早稻虽然受淹损失，但经过几次排涝抢种，也终于全部插上了晚稻。这里是个易涝易旱的地区，最近十多天没有下雨，已开始发生旱象了。现在全社已经组织了四部牛力水车和三十多部水车车水灌田，保证丘丘不缺水，肥田粉和石灰已经买来了一部分，妇女们也决定增积土肥，明后天耘过二遍田，就要下肥料。詹德乔说：“我们的水稻一定要在去年丰收的基础上再增产一成三，任何自然灾害都吓不倒我们，让老天爷也看看我们组织起来的力量。”
    村后山坡上，一支妇女大军也正在紧张地劳动着。西江第一农业生产合作社四个生产大队的女大队副率领了三十多个妇女，冒着炽烈的阳光，一部分在蕃薯地里除草，另一部分在开掘玉米地。前两天，妇女们也开会订出了计划：坚决消灭空地，利用山坡，田塍和屋边隙地，每户种一百株玉米，全社一百零八户，共可种一万零八百株，另外在全社二十万株蕃薯地上，再嵌种玉米一万株，并利用空地种黄豆籽二斗。今天，妇女们一大早就到山上来了，大家兴高采烈，掘地的掘地，除草的除草。五十一岁的何秀凤起早拾了两筐猪粪，又赶到山上参加掘地。六十八岁的姚阿翠上山一气拔了一千五百株蕃薯藤边的青草，也不感到疲倦。
    太阳落在西山背后，美丽的山下湖村慢慢地罩上了一层暮霭，农民们三三两两的回村了。晚饭后，西江第一农业生产合作社的社员们总结了一天的成绩：一百三十七个男劳动力耘田一百四十七亩，车水二百七十四亩，超过平常的工作量约百分之二十。三十六个妇女掘出玉米地七十二畦，并拔除了八万二千株蕃薯藤边的青草。村里互助组和单干农户在合作社的带动下，也做了比平常较多的工作，詹七生互助组已在山边开出二分多空地，种上了三百多株玉米。
