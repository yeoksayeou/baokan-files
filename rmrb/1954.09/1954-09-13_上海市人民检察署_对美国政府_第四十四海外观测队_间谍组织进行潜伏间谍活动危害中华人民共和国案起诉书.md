    Shanghai Municipal People's Procuratorate
    Indictment Against the U.S. Government's "Detachment 44 Overseas Survey" for Espionage Organization's Covert Espionage Activities Endangering the People's Republic of China
    Hu Jian (54) Zi No. 125
    On April 27, 1951, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau uncovered an espionage case involving the U.S. government's espionage organization "Detachment 44 Overseas Survey" (External Survey Detachment 44) with spies Hugh Francis Redmond, Wang Keyi, Luo Shixiang, and others潜伏 (lying dormant) in this city. A large number of incriminating items were seized on the spot, including radio transceivers, codebooks, radio station call sign wavelength tables, secret writing developing pills, intelligence drafts, and machine gun bullets. In November 1953, the bureau transferred all arrested defendants and seized criminal evidence to this Procuratorate. After investigation by this Procuratorate, it was confirmed that defendant Redmond was a member of the U.S. government espionage organization "Detachment 44 Overseas Survey." He established an espionage organization in China, hid military supplies, and engaged in espionage activities, committing a major crime endangering the People's Republic of China. Defendants Wang Keyi, Luo Shixiang, Ji Youkun, Ni Jingzhong, Wu Weilan, Xu Bin, Huang Huang, and others, participated in the U.S. government espionage organization, continuously stealing and probing into state secrets, and undermining our people's democratic cause, committing serious crimes of treason. The evidence is conclusive. This Procurator General hereby files a public prosecution against the criminal facts and evidence of defendant Redmond and others in accordance with the law.

    VI. Defendant Wu Weilan, also known as Wu Wenzhen, female, 49 years old, from Wuxian County, Jiangsu Province, residing at Room 4, No. 1, Lane 1950, Huaihai Middle Road, Shanghai. Before liberation, she served as an assistant in the supply group of the Shanghai Station of the U.S. government espionage organization "Detachment 44 Overseas Survey." After liberation, she served as a translator for U.S. spy Redmond. She was arrested at her residence on April 28, 1951.
    VII. Defendant Xu Bin, male, 31 years old, from Six Village, Chongming Miaozhen Township, Jiangsu Province. He worked as a radio operator in the Chiang Kai-shek gang's Salt Affairs Bureau in Zhuji and Jinhua, Zhejiang. In July 1946, he received training at the radio operator training class of the U.S. government espionage agency, the War Department Strategic Services Unit, in Tianjin. After graduation, he served as a radio operator at the Antung branch of the unit and the American Liaison Group in Shenyang. In February 1949, he became the radio operator for U.S. spy Redmond. After liberation, he continued to serve as the radio operator for U.S. spy Redmond. He was arrested at his residence on April 30, 1951.
    VIII. Defendant Huang Huang, also known as Huang Duanhua, female, 33 years old, from Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province, residing at 211 Changshu Road, Shanghai. She engaged in secret agent espionage activities with Wang Keyi for a long time. She was arrested at her residence on April 30, 1951.
    The main criminal facts of the above-mentioned defendants are listed separately as follows:
    I. Defendant Hugh Francis Redmond, also known as Jerome Strother, work code name "Euclid," is a member of the U.S. government espionage organization "Detachment 44 Overseas Survey." In 1946, he received espionage training at the Army Strategic Intelligence Office in Washington. In August of the same year, he was sent to China and served at the Beijing branch of "Detachment 44 Overseas Survey," responsible for military intelligence translation. In February 1947, when our Northeast Liberation War was tense, he was transferred to the Shenyang branch of the team, using the name of a liaison officer of the U.S. military liaison group to specifically contact Chiang Kai-shek's military intelligence agency, sending all the military intelligence about our army obtained daily to the Shanghai headquarters of "Detachment 44 Overseas Survey" via telegram. In March 1948, Redmond was transferred to the Shanghai headquarters. Soon after, he was responsible for war situation compilation work. In addition to compiling open military news daily, he also compiled military intelligence from various espionage stations across the country and regularly forwarded them to Washington headquarters, the U.S. occupation headquarters in Tokyo, the Seventh Fleet, and U.S. embassies and consulates in China.
    In the autumn of 1948, because Redmond actively engaged in espionage activities, Amos Moscrip, the station chief of the Shanghai headquarters of "Detachment 44 Overseas Survey," decided that, in addition to his original espionage duties, he should also control the training and dispatch work of intelligence personnel in the Positive Intelligence Section of the station. The intelligence agent, defendant Wang Keyi in this case, led by another U.S. spy Ronald Metz in the Shanghai headquarters, and Cong Kezhong (espionage code name Madison), the intelligence agent of John Singlaub, the station chief of the Shenyang branch, were transferred to his control one after another. After more than two months of secret plotting with Cong Kezhong, Redmond not only issued Cong Kezhong with six months of activity funds totaling US$2,500 but also provided Cong Kezhong with espionage training, personally imparting the tasks, methods, and liaison methods for future intelligence gathering, and ordering Cong Kezhong to return to Shenyang and use the潜伏 (lying dormant) radio station given to him by Singlaub to carry out espionage activities according to the so-called "Operation Buffer" (Cong Kezhong’s潜伏 (lying dormant) radio station was later moved to Beijing and has been cracked by the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau). In October 1948, Redmond, through the relationship of U.S. spy Ernest Weidel of the CounterIntelligence Section of the Shanghai headquarters of "Detachment 44 Overseas Survey," contacted Xin Zuqi, a Kuomintang secret agent formerly in Lushun. In addition to directly collecting Lushun port military intelligence from Xin Zuqi, he also provided training in photography technology. In December 1948, he allocated Xin Zuqi two small spy cameras, six rolls of film, and activity funds of US$750, ordering him to return to Lushun as soon as possible to steal photographs of Lushun port naval defense facilities, air force bases, and other activities. (Note: Xin Zuqi has been captured by the Lushun-Dalian Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau).
    In the spring of 1949, when the People's Liberation Army was approaching the Yangtze River and the Chiang Kai-shek gang was facing a complete collapse, Lloyd George, the U.S. government espionage agency's Far East intelligence chief, secretly came to Shanghai to plan for the "Detachment 44 Overseas Survey's" contingency plan and arranged for Redmond to潜伏 (lie dormant) in Shanghai to carry out espionage activities. According to Redmond's confession on March 12 and 27, 1952: "Lloyd George originally wanted me to go to Japan to serve as an intelligence agent to infiltrate the Soviet Union, but later agreed that I could stay, and told me that if I encountered any difficulties after liberation, I should go to the 15th floor of the Construction Building to contact U.S. Consul Roberton." "Soon after, Lloyd George and Robert Koke, the head of the intelligence group of the Shanghai headquarters of 'Detachment 44 Overseas Survey,' agreed that my main tasks in staying in Shanghai were four: (1) to control Wang Keyi's潜伏 (lying dormant) group in Shanghai to establish a secret radio station; (2) to control Cong Kezhong's潜伏 (lying dormant) group in Northeast China; (3) to find a way to open up transportation and communication lines between the north and south of China and from Shanghai to Taiwan; (4) to develop intelligence agents in Shanghai... Koke also found me a cover job at Henningsen Produce Co. in Shanghai (Note: a U.S. company), gave me an apartment, and allocated US$10,000 as潜伏 (lying dormant) activity and personal living expenses."
    After being arranged by Lloyd George and Koke, the Far East intelligence chiefs of the U.S. government espionage agency, Redmond began to潜伏 (lie dormant) and actively carried out espionage activities. In March 1949, Redmond issued Wang Keyi three U.S.-made radio transceivers and sixteen codebooks, instigating Wang Keyi to quickly find a site to set up a station, and the Shanghai headquarters of "Detachment 44 Overseas Survey" selected defendant Xu Bin to serve as a radio operator. Under Redmond's leadership, Wang Keyi first set up a radio station in the Nanshi area of the city to communicate. After that, Redmond made the following arrangements: (1) He spent US$2,000 to rent several apartments at 211 Changshu Road for Wang Keyi's潜伏 (lying dormant) activities after liberation; (2) He recruited defendant Wu Weilan as a translator; (3) He instructed Wang Keyi that, once Shanghai was liberated, he should quickly report the situation of the People's Liberation Army entering Shanghai and the retreat of the Kuomintang army to Taiwan via telegram; (4) He wanted Wang Keyi to find a way to establish an intelligence transportation network from Shanghai to Taiwan (see Redmond's confession on March 27, 1952).
    After the liberation of Shanghai, Redmond, with the assistance of Wu Weilan, moved around to all locations. On the one hand, he sent a letter to Beijing asking Cong Kezhong to come to Shanghai quickly to discuss future activity plans in secret; at the same time, he drafted telegraphs of the intelligence he had collected and instructed Wang Keyi to quickly communicate with the U.S. espionage agency in Taiwan. In November 1949, Redmond further arranged for Wang Keyi to潛伏 (lie dormant) in Tianjin, Beijing, and other places to steal and probe into our central and local military and political secrets, and to establish a water and land transportation network from Northeast China to Shanghai. According to the confessions of defendants Redmond and Wang Keyi and the seized evidence, it is proven that the scope of intelligence activity instructions given by defendant Redmond to Wang Keyi was extremely broad. Redmond confessed: "Wang Keyi had intelligence agents in Shenyang, Lushun, and other places, and the work code name was Weather Cloudy. Wang's task was to collect information on naval and air force military defense facilities in the Liaodong Peninsula, Soviet air force intelligence in the Khabarovsk region, and relevant Chinese Communist military, political, and economic intelligence. ... I taught him how to write intelligence reports, how to use human blood secret writing, I wanted him to collect Soviet air force intelligence in the Lushun-Dalian area, and gave him a sketch of the aircraft pattern to help him identify the aircraft patterns... I instructed him that he must collect Shanghai's air defense measures..." (See Redmond's confession on March 12, 1952).
    Redmond's contact with U.S. espionage organizations in Hong Kong was through the activities of defendant Luo Shixiang. Luo Shixiang brought secret instructions and espionage activity funds of US$2,000 from U.S. espionage organizations in Hong Kong to Redmond twice, in September 1950 and February 1951. At the same time, Luo Shixiang reported Redmond's activities in Shanghai to U.S. espionage organizations in Hong Kong.
    Redmond's espionage activities in Shanghai were not only led by the U.S. government espionage organization "Detachment 44 Overseas Survey," but also supported by the American priest Thomas Leonard Phillips of the Catholic Jesuit Society and others. In November 1950, when Redmond's activity funds were exhausted, he twice obtained financial assistance from American priests Fei Youwen and He Yongzhi (John Alexander Houle) of the Catholic Jesuit Society and American priest Ge Huairen (Joseph Patrick Mccormack) of the Maryknoll Foreign Mission Society. (Note: Fei Youwen, He Yongzhi, and Ge Huairen have been arrested and interrogated by the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau and will be dealt with in separate cases).
    After our public security organs discovered the above-mentioned criminal acts of defendant Redmond and others, Redmond was arrested according to the law on April 27, 1951. Twenty-four intelligence reports reported by Wang Keyi, a work report on the Beijing trip, and a payroll of intelligence personnel were found in his residence, along with a bottle of secret writing developing pills, a draft of instructions to Cong Kezhong, a list of secret communication addresses with U.S. espionage agencies in Hong Kong, and 31 other intelligence materials and correspondence letters. Later, a box of machine gun bullets hidden by Redmond was found in the home of Lediansky, a stateless person (who has been dealt with in a separate case).
    II. Defendant Wang Keyi, also known as He Shunfei, espionage code name "Farmingdale," is a professional secret agent. Since joining the Chiang Kai-shek gang's Central Party Headquarters in 1934, he has been led by war criminal Chen Lifu and others, consistently engaging in counter-revolutionary activities. He served as "Guidance Commissioner for Industrial and Commercial Movements of the Beining Railway under the Social Department," "Leader of the Jidong Intelligence Group of the First War Zone Commander's Headquarters," and "Supervisory Commissioner for Industrial and Commercial Movements in the Pingjin Area under the Social Department," accepting orders from Chiang Kai-shek's secret service organs to specifically collect information on Communist activities (see seized telegram No. Xiaozi 3790 from the Chiang Kai-shek gang's First War Zone Commander's Headquarters). During this period, defendant Wang Keyi frequently traveled between Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Luoyang, and Chongqing, recruiting accomplices and collecting information on worker movements along the Beining Line-Pinggu Line and in Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, Majiagou, and other places, as well as military and political intelligence from the Jidong, Taihang, Taiyue, and other liberated areas, compiling it into a book and forwarding it to Chiang Kai-shek secret service organs in Chongqing and other places.
    In 1945, defendant Wang Keyi submitted the military and political intelligence about our liberated areas that he had collected over eight years to the U.S. Strategic Intelligence Bureau (O.S.S.) stationed in Chongqing at the time and joined the espionage organization, colluding with U.S. espionage elements to engage in treasonous activities. In April 1946, he transferred to the U.S. Army Strategic Intelligence Office (S.S.U.) in Tianjin, and was dispatched by James Kellies, the head of the office, to Changchun and other places to establish intelligence groups (work code name Weather Cloudy), set up radio stations, and develop intelligence personnel, specifically probing into the military intelligence of our Qiqihar, Jiamusi, Harbin, and other places, as well as Soviet troops stationed in the Lushun-Dalian area, directly telegraphing to Tianjin. In May 1947, Wang Keyi went to Shenyang, and his espionage relationship was transferred to the leadership of U.S. spies Nels J.L. Benson and John Chrislaw, the person in charge of the Antung branch of "Detachment 44 Overseas Survey."
    Defendant Wang Keyi collected a large amount of intelligence on major cities during his time in Northeast China, and all of it was extremely important. The intelligence drafts seized by us alone numbered 276, including "Summary of the Military and Political Situation of the Communist Army in Qiqihar," "Situation of the Grain Conference in Nenjiang," "Enemy Situation in Wangyemiao," "Military Mobilization of the Communist Army in Jiamusi," and "Overview of the Xiaofengman Power Plant." In May 1948, after defendant Wang Keyi came to Shanghai with Chrislaw, he was led by U.S. spy Ronald Metz of the Shanghai headquarters of "Detachment 44 Overseas Survey." In the autumn of 1948, he was transferred to Redmond's control and, under Redmond's leadership, actively set up潜伏 (lying dormant) radio stations and probed into our military and political intelligence with Xu Bin, Wu Weilan, Huang Huang, and others. In November 1949, defendant Wang Keyi, under Redmond's instructions, probed into our military and political secrets in Beijing and Tianjin, and planned to recruit intelligence agents to establish a water and land transportation network from Northeast China to Shanghai. An inspection of the large amount of intelligence that defendant Wang Keyi supplied to Redmond after liberation shows that there are: "Name List of Main Personnel Affiliated with the Beijing Municipal People's Government," "People of Beijing's Present and Past Attitudes towards the Communist Party, the United States, and the Soviet Union," "Situation of the Runways at Shanghai Jiangwan and Dachang Airports," "Names and Biographical Sketches of Important Personnel of the East China Military and Political Committee," "Shanghai's Air Defense Facilities," and other important intelligence, and he received a total of more than US$4,200 in espionage activity funds from Redmond.
    In addition to colluding with Redmond, defendant Wang Keyi's treasonous activities also included carrying more than 30 pieces of intelligence, such as "Construction Situation of Shanghai Dachang Airport" and "Shanghai's Air Defense Measures," to Hong Kong and handing them over to Ralph Nelson Clough, the consul of the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong, and U.S. spy Johnson in December 1950, and reporting the progress of his various潜伏 (lying dormant) activities. After that, Wang Keyi had more than six secret talks with Johnson, accepting Johnson's instructions: (1) to develop a translator in Shanghai and one to two people who understand military knowledge in order to collect Shanghai's various airport air defense facilities and river and coastal defense intelligence; (2) to agree on contact methods. He also obtained a call sign wavelength table and espionage activity funds of US$3,600, returning to Shanghai in February 1951, and was about to continue his activities when he was captured by the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau. Two U.S.-made receiving sets, one transmitting set, nine transceiver parts, two call sign wavelength tables, sixteen codebooks, 276 intelligence drafts, 48 Chiang Kai-shek reactionary orders and secret agent activity cover documents, intelligence instructions and military maps, secret language records, telegraph drafts, and other important evidence from U.S. spies Kellies, Benson, Chrislaw, and Redmond, and US$2,839 in espionage activity funds were successively seized.
    III. Defendant Luo Shixiang participated in a U.S. espionage organization and engaged in espionage activities before liberation. In the spring of 1949, "Detachment 44 Overseas Survey" was forced to withdraw from the mainland, and Luo Shixiang, under the instructions of a U.S. spy,潜伏 (lay dormant) in Shanghai. In addition to hiding radio transceivers, secret writing developing pills, intelligence drafts, and rosters of intelligence personnel, he was responsible for probing into confidential information from our government agencies and serving as a liaison between Redmond and U.S. espionage organizations in Hong Kong.
    When defendant Luo Shixiang probed into confidential information from our government agencies, he developed defendant Ji Youkun as an informant in our Shanghai Customs in September 1949, stealing intelligence such as an overview of the organization and personnel of the Shanghai Customs. In March 1950, he sent Ji Youkun to Hong Kong to receive espionage activity funds from U.S. espionage organizations in Hong Kong. In June of the same year, Luo Shixiang also went to Hong Kong, and went to Hong Kong a second time in August to report on his work and accept instructions to step up the expansion of the espionage organization, designating the Shanghai Municipal Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the Shanghai Railway Administration, the Shanghai Customs, and the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau as key areas for development. After defendant Luo Shixiang returned to Shanghai, he also developed defendant Ni Jingzhong, a Shanghai Customs staff member, as an informant. After that, defendants Luo and Ni separately or jointly carried intelligence to Hong Kong three times in October 1950 and January and March 1951, delivering it to U.S. espionage organizations in Hong Kong, and receiving espionage activity funds totaling more than US$10,000. The important intelligence probed into by defendant Luo Shixiang includes "Construction Situation of Shanghai Dachang Airport," "Shanghai's Financial Trends," "Situation of the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries and Participation in Cadre Activities," and "Military Industry in Northeast and North China." Subsequently, U.S. spies in Hong Kong further instructed Luo Shixiang to subvert our air force personnel and expand espionage activities to the Yangtze River coast and other places. In addition, defendant Luo Shixiang also made many activities in serving as a liaison between U.S. espionage organizations in Hong Kong and Redmond. For example, when he returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong in September 1950, he brought secret instructions from U.S. spies in Hong Kong and handed them over to defendant Redmond. In January 1951, when Luo Shixiang went to Hong Kong for the fourth time, he brought back espionage activity funds of US$2,000 and a secret instruction, and went to Redmond's place with Ni Jingzhong to hand it over in person.
    After the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau discovered defendant Luo Shixiang's criminal activities, he was arrested according to the law on April 29, 1951, and radio transceivers and four bottles of secret writing developing pills that defendant Luo Shixiang had transferred and hidden were seized.
    IV. Defendant Ji Youkun worked as an inspector in the puppet Shanghai Customs before liberation. After liberation, he remained as an inspector. In September 1949, through Luo Shixiang's relationship, he became an informant for "Detachment 44 Overseas Survey," stealing confidential information such as the organization and personnel overview of the Shanghai Customs, the addresses and phone numbers of leading personnel, and handing it over to U.S. spies through Luo Shixiang. In March 1950, he went to Hong Kong under Luo Shixiang's instructions to contact U.S. espionage organizations in Hong Kong and receive espionage activity funds of US$1,600. In early January 1951, he潜伏 (snuck) back to Shanghai to continue espionage activities.
    V. Defendant Ni Jingzhong served as a tax police officer and inspector in the puppet Shanghai Customs before liberation. After liberation, he remained as an inspector. In October 1950, he was developed by Luo Shixiang to become an informant for "Detachment 44 Overseas Survey." In December 1950, he went to Hong Kong under Luo Shixiang's instructions to contact U.S. espionage organizations in Hong Kong. He subsequently went to Hong Kong twice with Luo Shixiang, handing over important intelligence stolen from the Customs, such as the "Location of Huangpu River Warehouses" and "Import and Export Situation of Customs Ships and Types of Goods Loaded, Destination," and intelligence that he had probed into, such as "Firepower of Warships on the Huangpu River," "Fisheries Management," and "Air Defense Facilities, Aircraft Types, and Quantities at Hongqiao, Jiangwan, and Dachang Airports," to U.S. espionage organizations in Hong Kong. He received more than US$1,500 in espionage activity funds and jointly served with Luo Shixiang as a liaison between the espionage organization and Redmond.
    VI. Defendant Wu Weilan worked at the U.S. Navy Department in Shanghai in 1947. In 1947, she joined the supply group of the Shanghai headquarters of the U.S. government espionage organization "Detachment 44 Overseas Survey" as an assistant. After the liberation of Shanghai, she continued to be in charge of and hide houses and furniture for the espionage organization. She continued to engage in潜伏 (lying dormant) espionage activities with Redmond, receiving US$50 in activity funds each month. She used her residence as an activity liaison point and met with Wang Keyi many times at the Jinjiang Tea Room and other places, receiving, forwarding, and translating intelligence for Redmond, and forwarding espionage activity funds. In addition, the defendant actively assisted Redmond in contacting Cong Kezhong.
    VII. Defendant Xu Bin worked as a radio operator in the Chiang Kai-shek gang's Salt Affairs Bureau in Zhuji and Jinhua, Zhejiang. In July 1946, he received training at the radio training class of the U.S. Army Strategic Intelligence Office in Tianjin. After graduation, he was assigned as a radio operator and translator at the Antung branch station. In February 1947, he was transferred to the "U.S. Military Liaison Group" in Shenyang to be responsible for the receiving, sending, and translating of intelligence from Changchun, Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai, and other places. In February 1949, he contacted the Shanghai headquarters of "Detachment 44 Overseas Survey." In March of the same year, Redmond assigned him as the radio operator for Wang Keyi's潜伏 (lying dormant) group, receiving US$150 in activity funds each month. After several secret plots together, he actively launched station-setting activities. After the liberation of this city, he and Wang Keyi conspired many times to install a radio station and send intelligence to the U.S. espionage organization stationed in Taiwan.
    VIII. Defendant Huang Huang is Wang Keyi's wife. Since 1938, she has participated in secret agent activities, serving as Wang Keyi's intelligence copyist in Tianjin, Luoyang, Changchun, Shenyang, Shanghai, and other places for a long time. Almost all of the intelligence drafts and maps seized by us were hand-copied by Huang Huang. After the liberation of Shanghai, in addition to continuing to serve as a copyist for all espionage reports, she served as a liaison between Wu Weilan and Wang Keyi. After this case was discovered by us, she colluded with Wang Keyi to transfer important evidence such as intelligence drafts, reactionary orders, and codebooks to other places for continued concealment.
    In summary, the above-mentioned facts fully prove that the reactionary ruling clique of U.S. imperialism consistently established a large espionage organization in major cities of our country during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War to undermine the Chinese people's cause of liberation. After the nationwide liberation, our people's revolutionary cause has achieved great victory, but U.S. imperialism is not reconciled to its failure and continues to carry out aggressive activities against our country, sending and developing espionage secret agents to carry out sabotage activities. Defendant Redmond was sent by the U.S. government espionage agency to潜伏 (lie dormant) for the purpose of aggression against the People's Republic of China and undermining the Chinese people's democratic cause, organizing an espionage organization in our country, probing into our state secrets, and privately hiding military supplies. Defendants Wang Keyi, Luo Shixiang, Ji Youkun, Ni Jingzhong, Wu Weilan, Xu Bin, Huang Huang, and others colluded with imperialism, betrayed the motherland, and engaged in treasonous activities under the command of U.S. government espionage agencies, such as setting up radio stations, developing espionage organizations, and probing into our state secrets, undermining our people's democratic cause, which is indeed a serious crime. The defendants in this case, due to the conclusive evidence of the above-mentioned crimes, have confessed to each other separately. A public prosecution is hereby filed, requesting that the provisions of the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries be applied to punish them severely according to law.
        Respectfully submitted to the Military Law Department of the Shanghai Municipal Military Control Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

    兹将右列各被告的主要犯罪事实，分别列述如下：
    一、被告雷德蒙（Hugh　Francis　Redmond），化名斯特罗萨（Jerome　Strother），工作代号
  “尤克利特”（Euclid），是美国政府间谍组织“第四十四海外观测队”成员之一，一九四六年在华盛顿陆军战略情报处受间谍训练。同年八月被派遣来中国，在“第四十四海外观测队”北京分站担任军事情报译电工作。一九四七年二月，在我东北解放战争紧张之际，调往该队沈阳分站，以美军联络团联络员名义，专事与蒋匪军事情报机构联系，逐日将所得有关我军的军事情报，以电报转报“第四十四海外观测队”上海总站。一九四八年三月，雷德蒙调上海总站后，不久即负责战况汇编工作，除逐日汇编公开性的军事消息外，并汇编来自全国各间谍站之军事情报，定期分别转报华盛顿总部、东京美国占领军总部、第七舰队及美国驻华使领馆等处。
    一九四八年秋，因雷德蒙积极从事间谍活动，经“第四十四海外观测队”上海总站站长莫斯克里泼（AmosMoscrip）决定，除担任原来的间谍职务外，并掌握该站情报组（PositiveIntelligence　Section）情报人员之训练与派遣工作。并将上海总站之另一美国间谍迈兹（Ronald　Metz）所领导的情报员即本案被告王可一，和沈阳分站站长辛乐甫（John　Singlaub）之情报员丛克中（间谍代号麦迪逊Madison）先后划归其掌握，雷德蒙与丛克中经过两个多月的密谋，除发给丛克中半年活动经费美钞二千五百元外，并对丛克中施以间谍训练，面授今后刺探情报之任务、方法及联络办法等，着丛克中即回沈阳，利用辛乐甫交给他的潜伏电台，根据所谓“博佛计划”（Opeoratin　Buffer）进行间谍活动（按丛克中潜伏电台后移北京，已由我北京市人民政府公安局破获）。一九四八年十月雷德蒙又通过“第四十四海外观测队“上海总站反谍组（CounterIntelligence　Section）美国间谍伟德尔（Ernestweidel）之关系，与原在旅顺之军统匪特辛祖祺取得联系。除当面向辛祖祺搜集旅顺港湾军事情报外，并施以摄影技术等训练。于一九四八年十二月，拨给辛祖祺间谍用小型照像机二架，软片六卷，活动经费美钞七百五十元，命其从速赶回旅顺，从事偷摄旅顺港湾海防设施、空军基地等活动。（按：辛祖祺已为我旅大市人民政府公安局捕获）。
    一九四九年春，我人民解放军进逼长江，蒋匪帮面临全面崩溃之际，美国政府间谍机关远东情报负责人劳埃·乔治（Lloyd　George）秘密来沪，策谋“第四十四海外观测队”应变计划，并布置雷德蒙潜伏上海进行间谍活动。据雷德蒙一九五二年三月十二日及二十七日供称：“劳埃·乔治本来要我到日本去担任派遣情报员打入苏联的任务，后来又同意我留下，并告我在解放后如遇到困难，就到建设大厦十五楼去与美国领事馆领事罗伯顿（Roberton）联系。”“不久之后，劳埃·乔治与‘第四十四海外观测队’上海总站情报组负责人柯克（Robert　Koke）同意我留上海主要任务有四：（1）掌握上海王可一潜伏组建立秘密电台；
  （2）掌握东北丛克中潜伏组；（3）设法打通中国南北以及上海到台湾的交通联络线；（4）在上海发展情报员……。柯克并替我在上海海宁生洋行（Henningsen　Produce　Co．）（按：美商）找到一个掩护职业，给我一间公寓房子，并拨给我一万美元，作为潜伏活动及我个人生活费用。”
    雷德蒙受美国政府间谍机关远东情报负责人劳埃·乔治及柯克之布置后，即进行潜伏并积极开展间谍活动。一九四九年三月，雷德蒙发给王可一美制收发报机三具，密码本十六本，唆使王可一迅速觅址架台，并由“第四十四海外观测队”上海总站选派被告徐斌充当报务员。在雷德蒙领导下，王可一首先在本市南市架台通报。此后雷德蒙又作了下列的布置：（1）出资美钞二千元，租顶常熟路二百十一号公寓房屋数间作为解放后王可一潜伏活动之用；（2）收罗被告吴薇兰为翻译；（3）指使王可一，一旦上海解放即应迅速将解放军进驻上海情况及国民党军队撤退情况，拍电报报告台湾；（4）要王可一设法建立上海至台湾的情报交通网（见雷德蒙一九五二年三月二十七日供词）。
    上海解放后，雷德蒙在吴薇兰的协助下四处活动，一方面去信北京要丛克中速来上海密商今后活动计划；同时将其所搜集之情报，亲拟电稿指使王可一从速与台湾美国间谍机关通报。一九四九年十一月，雷德蒙乃进一步布置王可一潜往天津、北京等地窃取、刺探我中央及地方军政机密，并建立自东北至上海水陆交通网。据被告雷德蒙、王可一的口供及所缴获的罪证，证明被告雷德蒙给王可一情报活动指示范围极为广泛。雷德蒙供：“王可一在沈阳、旅顺等地，都有情报员，工作代号是阴天（Wea-ther　Cloudy），王的任务是给我搜集辽东半岛有关海军、空军的军事防御设施，苏联伯力地区的空军情报，有关中共军事政治经济情报。……我教过他怎样写情报报告，怎样用人血密写法，我要他搜集旅大地区苏联空军方面的情报，并给他一张飞机样式的草图，以便他辨别飞机的样式……我指示他必须搜集上海防空措施……”（见雷德蒙一九五二年三月十二日的供词）。
    雷德蒙与美国在香港间谍组织的联系，是通过被告罗世祥的活动。罗世祥于一九五○年九月及一九五一年二月两次从香港带来美国在香港间谍组织给雷德蒙的秘密指示及间谍活动经费美钞二千元。同时，罗世祥把雷德蒙在上海的活动情况，向美国在香港间谍组织作汇报。
    被告雷德蒙在上海的间谍活动，不但受美国政府间谍组织“第四十四海外观测队”之领导，并受天主教耶稣会美籍神甫斐有文（Thomas　LeonardPhillips）等的支持。一九五○年十一月，雷德蒙活动经费匮乏之际，曾两度取得天主教耶稣会美籍神甫斐有文、何雍之（John　Alexander　Houle）及玛利诺外方传教会美籍神甫葛怀仁（JosephPatricck　Mccormack）等的经费接济。（按：斐有文、何雍之、葛怀仁已由我上海市人民政府公安局捕讯，另案处理）。
    被告雷德蒙等上开犯罪行为，经我公安机关侦悉，乃于一九五一年四月二十七日将雷德蒙依法逮捕，并在其住所搜获王可一所报情报报告二十四份，北京之行工作报告及情报人员发薪账单各一份、密写显影丸一瓶、给丛克中指示底稿一份、与美国在香港的间谍机关秘密通讯地址表一份，以及其他情报资料来往信件等三十一件，之后又在无国籍人李强斯基（Lediansky已另案处理）家中抄获雷德蒙匿藏之机枪子弹一箱。
    二、被告王可一，化名何顺飞，间谍代号“法明黛尔”（Farmingdale），职业特务。自一九三四年进入蒋匪中央党部工作起，即受战犯陈立夫等的领导，一贯进行反革命活动。历充蒋匪“社会部北宁铁路工商运动指导专员”、“第一战区长官司令部冀东谍报组组长”，及蒋匪“社会部平津工商运动督导专员”等职，接受蒋匪特务机关之命令专事搜集共产党活动情况（见缴获蒋匪第一战区长官司令部孝字三七九○代电）。被告王可一在此期间，经常来往于北京、天津、上海、洛阳、重庆之间，网罗爪牙，多方搜集北宁线—平古线沿线和北京、天津、唐山、马家沟等地工人运动的情报，以及冀东、太行、太岳等解放区军政情报，汇编成册转报重庆等地的蒋匪特务机关。
    一九四五年，被告王可一，将其在八年中所搜集关于我解放区军政情报，递供当时驻重庆的美国战略情报局（O·S·S·），并参加该间谍组织勾结美国间谍分子从事叛国活动。一九四六年四月，转入天津美国陆军战略情报处（S·S·U·），并由该处负责人凯力斯（James　Kellies）派遣赴长春等地建立情报小组（工作代号阴天Weather Cloudy），架设电台，发展情报人员，专事刺探我齐齐哈尔、佳木斯、哈尔滨等地及旅大地区苏联驻军等的军事情报，直接电告天津。一九四七年五月，王可一去沈阳，其间谍关系先后转由美国间谍彭森
  （Nels　J．L．Benson）及“第四十四海外观测队”安东分站负责人克立斯劳（John　Chrislaw）领导。
    被告王可一在东北期间搜集各大城市之情报为数甚巨，且都极为重要，仅为我缴获之情报底稿，即有二百七十六份，内中有“齐齐哈尔共军军政情况摘要”、“嫩江粮食会议情形”、“王爷庙敌情”、
  “共军在佳木斯之军事调动”、“小丰满电厂概况”等。一九四八年五月，被告王可一与克立斯劳同来上海之后，即归“第四十四海外观测队”上海总站美国间谍迈兹（Ronald　Metz）领导，一九四八年秋，转由雷德蒙掌握，并在雷德蒙的领导下，与徐斌、吴薇兰、黄皇等积极架设潜伏电台及刺探我军政情报。一九四九年十一月，被告王可一，又受雷德蒙之指使，在北京、天津刺探我军政机密，并谋收罗情报员建立自东北至上海水陆交通网。查被告王可一在解放后所供给雷德蒙的大量情报中，有：“北京市人民政府所属主要人员姓名表”、“北京人民对共产党、美国和苏联今昔之态度”、“上海江湾、大场飞机场跑道情况”、“华东军政委员会重要人员姓名及其简历”、“上海防空设备”等，以及其他重要情报，并先后从雷德蒙处领得间谍活动经费计美钞四千二百余元。
    被告王可一之叛国活动，除勾结雷德蒙外，当因故与雷德蒙失去联系后，又于一九五○年十二月携带“上海大场机场修建情况”、“上海防空措施”等情报三十余件，潜往香港交给美国驻港领事馆领事高立夫（Ralph　Nelson　Clough）及美国间谍约翰逊，并报告其各种潜伏活动之经过。此后王可一与约翰逊作了六次以上之密谈，接受约翰逊指示：（1）在沪发展翻译一人，懂军事常识人员一至二人，以便搜集上海各机场防空设施及江防海防情报；（2）约定联系办法。并取得呼号波长表及间谍活动经费美钞三千六百元，于一九五一年二月返沪，正将继续开展活动，即为我上海市人民政府公安局捕获，先后搜出美制收报机二具，发报机一具，收发报机零件九件，呼号波长表二张，密码本十六本，情报底稿二百七十六份，蒋匪反动派令及特务活动掩护证件等四十八件，美国间谍凯力斯、彭森、克立斯劳、雷德蒙等情报指示及军用地图、密语记录、电报底稿等重要罪证二十四件及间谍活动经费美钞二千八百三十九元。
    三、被告罗世祥，解放前即参加美国间谍组织，进行间谍活动。一九四九年春，“第四十四海外观测队”被迫撤离大陆，罗世祥受美国间谍指使，潜伏上海，除匿藏收发报机、密写显影丸、情报底稿及情报人员名册外，并担任刺探我政府机关机密情报，又担任雷德蒙与美国在香港间谍组织之间的联络。
    被告罗世祥刺探我机关内部情报活动时，曾于一九四九年九月，在我上海海关发展被告季有崑为情报员，窃取我上海海关组织人事概况等情报。一九五○年三月，曾派季有崑先去香港向美国在香港的间谍组织领取间谍活动经费。同年六月，罗世祥亦接踵去港，八月又二次去港汇报工作，并接受指示，加紧扩展间谍组织，并指定以上海市中苏友好协会、上海铁路管理局、上海海关及上海市人民政府公安局等处为发展重点。被告罗世祥返沪后，又发展了上海海关人员被告倪敬忠为情报员。此后罗、倪两被告曾分别或共同于一九五○年十月及一九五一年一月、三月三次携带情报去港，送交美国在香港的间谍组织，并先后领到间谍活动经费计美钞一万余元。被告罗世祥所刺探的情报，其中重要的有
  “上海大场机场修建情况”、“上海金融动态”、“镇反及参干运动情况”、“东北华北军火工业”等件。接着香港美国间谍进一步指使罗世祥策反我空军人员，并扩展间谍活动至长江沿岸等地。此外，被告罗世祥在担任美国在香港间谍组织与雷德蒙之间的联络上，亦作了多次的活动，如一九五○年九月当其由港返沪时，即携带香港美国间谍秘密指示交给被告雷德蒙。一九五一年一月，罗世祥第四次去香港时，又携带间谍活动经费美钞二千元及秘密指示一件回沪，与倪敬忠同去雷德蒙处当面递交。
    被告罗世祥之犯罪活动，经我上海市人民政府公安局侦悉后，于一九五一年四月二十九日依法予以逮捕，并搜获被告罗世祥所转藏之收发报机各一具及密写显影丸四瓶。
    四、被告季有崑，解放前即在伪上海海关充稽查。解放后仍留任稽查。一九四九年九月通过罗世祥的关系充当“第四十四海外观测队”情报员，窃取上海海关组织人事概况、领导人员之住址电话等机密情报，经罗世祥之手转报美国间谍，并于一九五○年三月，接受罗世祥的指示去港，与美国在香港的间谍组织进行联系，领取间谍活动经费美钞一千六百元。一九五一年一月初，潜回上海，继续进行间谍活动。
    五、被告倪敬忠，解放前，即在伪上海海关充任税警、稽查等职，解放后仍留任稽查。一九五○年十月，经罗世祥发展充当“第四十四海外观测队”情报员，一九五○年十二月接受罗世祥之指示去港与美国在香港的间谍组织进行联系，续又与罗世祥两次同去香港，将窃自海关之“黄浦江栈房地点”、“海关船只进出口情况及所装货物种类、运往地点”等重要情报，及刺探到的：“黄浦江上兵舰火力”、“渔业管理”、“虹桥、江湾、大场各机场防空设施及飞机型式、数量”等情报递供美国在香港的间谍组织，先后领取间谍活动经费美钞一千五百余元，并与罗世祥共同担任该间谍组织与雷德蒙之间的联络任务。
    六、被告吴薇兰，一九四七年曾任职于上海美国海军部，一九四七年参加美国政府间谍组织“第四十四海外观测队”上海总站供应组为助理员。上海解放后，仍为该间谍组织保管及隐匿房屋家具等。继与雷德蒙共同进行潜伏间谍活动，每月领取活动经费美钞五十元。将其住所作为活动联络地点，并多次在锦江茶室等处与王可一会面，为雷德蒙收转和翻译情报，及转发间谍活动经费。此外，该被告积极协助雷德蒙与丛克中进行联系。
    七、被告徐斌，曾在浙江诸暨、金华等地蒋匪盐务局充当电台报务员。一九四六年七月在天津美国陆军战略情报处报务训练班受训，毕业后派充安东分站电台报务员及译电员。一九四七年二月被调至沈阳“美军联络团”担任与长春、北京、天津、青岛、上海等地情报收发及译电工作。一九四九年二月与“第四十四海外观测队”上海总站取得联系，同年三月间由雷德蒙派充王可一潜伏组电台报务员，每月领取活动经费美钞一百五十元，经共同进行多次密谋，即积极展开架台活动。本市解放后，与王可一多次策谋装置电台，向美国驻台湾间谍组织拍发情报。
    八、被告黄皇，系王可一之妻。一九三八年起，即参加特务活动，先后在天津、洛阳、长春、沈阳、上海等地，长期担任王可一的情报抄写员，所有被我抄获之情报底稿及地图等，几乎全部为黄皇手抄。上海解放后，除继续充任所有谍报之抄写工作外，并为吴薇兰与王可一之间的联系人，及本案为我侦悉后，又串同王可一将情报底稿、反动派令、密码本等重要罪证移转他地，继续隐藏。
    综合上述事实，充分证明美帝国主义反动统治集团，在我抗战期间及解放战争期间，一贯在我国各大城市建立了庞大的间谍组织，破坏中国人民的解放事业。全国解放以后，我人民革命事业已经取得伟大的胜利，可是美帝国主义并不甘心于他们的失败，继续对我国进行侵略活动，派遣和发展间谍特务分子进行破坏活动。被告雷德蒙受美国政府间谍机关派遣潜伏，以侵略中华人民共和国，破坏中国人民民主事业为目的，在我国境内组织间谍组织，刺探我国家机密，并私藏军火；被告王可一、罗世祥、季有崑、倪敬忠、吴薇兰、徐斌、黄皇等勾结帝国主义，背叛祖国在美国政府间谍机关的指挥下，从事架设电台发展间谍组织，刺探我国家机密等叛国活动，破坏我人民民主事业，实属罪恶重大。本案各被告，对上开罪行，由于罪证确凿，各自分别供认，特此提起公诉，请依中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例的规定，依法严处。
        此致中国人民解放军上海市军事管制委员会军法处
          上海市人民检察署副检察长方行
