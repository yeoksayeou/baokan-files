Labor is a Glorious and Heroic Undertaking
Liu Dezhen, Representative to the National People's Congress, Model Worker of Beijing Industry

	When I was fourteen years old, I started working with my father at the Shijingshan Power Plant. In the old society, we worked more than a dozen hours a day at heavy labor, sometimes even continuously for thirty or forty hours, but all we got was enslavement and humiliation. Japanese imperialists beat us with whips and samurai swords, and Kuomintang factory police beat us with rifle butts and bayonets. The electricity we generated was taken by the exploiters for their enjoyment, while we lived in dark houses on half-empty stomachs. I remember that during the most brutal exploitation by the enemy, workers at the Shijingshan Power Plant, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, and the railways died every day because they couldn't even afford bean cake flour. The Japanese dragged their bodies to the small ditches in Shijingshan to feed the wild dogs. I also saw old workers who had labored all their lives being driven out of the factories by the Japanese or the Kuomintang, and finally committing suicide miserably in the gullies. At that time, the more work one did, the more one was exploited. The reactionaries called us "stinky workers" and didn't look at us as equals. The old society also thought that "being a worker" was not honorable and had no future. For us workers, labor meant suffering, discrimination, starvation, and death. People regarded entering the factory as an unfortunate and unavoidable event, and production morale was naturally low.

	After liberation, we workers became the masters of the country and the factories. Our labor is for the prosperity of our country led by the working class, which means for the happiness of the working class and the people of the whole country. Over the past five years, we have worked hard and achieved great successes. The country is prospering day by day, advancing along the socialist road, and our lives are constantly improving. Our factory has built huge bridge-type coal conveyors and mechanical ash removal equipment, which have replaced the heavy physical labor of the workers. The state has spent a lot of money to improve the ventilation and insulation of the engine room and to build new dust collectors to protect the health of the workers. New workers' dormitories have also been built one after another on the hillside.

	The many facts of the past five years have made us realize that ensuring the safe supply of electricity to the capital and reducing the cost of power generation is contributing to the construction of a great socialist society. Building a socialist society is the most glorious and solemn cause of mankind. In this cause, whoever labors well, whoever contributes greatly, is respected. Labor competitions are increasingly developing, and overcoming difficulties in production is considered the most glorious thing. One night in June 1950, the insulation wall behind a pulverized coal furnace in our factory suddenly collapsed. To prevent it from affecting the power supply, workers Ling Xumu, Zhang Wenxing, Zhao Kun, Zheng Guotai, Zhang Chundi, and others braved the high temperatures to go into the furnace to repair it. The furnace was filled with choking ash and smoke, the brick walls were scorching hot, and the water pipes were scalding. The workers' faces were flushed, and sweat was constantly flowing, but their spirits remained high. When they felt dizzy, they came out to cool off for a dozen minutes and then went back in, persisting until the furnace was repaired.

	Because labor is glorious, we think of all sorts of ways to improve the effectiveness of labor. Without increasing new power generating equipment, we have more than doubled the amount of electricity generated and reduced the coal consumption rate by one-third over the past five years. This year, all the employees of the factory guarantee that the amount of electricity generated will be 11.12 percent higher than last year. At the technical innovation presentation meetings held on the evenings of June 15th and 19th, the team I used to be in, in the turbine workshop, presented the method of removing steam turbine blades without disassembling the impeller. Wang Shiqi's team proposed a guarantee of no oil leakage from the cooling oil cylinder. Tong Huizeng's team presented the experience of reducing the oxygen content. Wang Chunting, a veteran worker in the transportation workshop, guaranteed to immediately convert the first coal conveyor to automatic operation. Everyone is determined to contribute their wisdom and strength to strive for the early realization of the country's socialist industrialization.

    劳动是光荣的豪迈的事业
    全国人民代表大会代表 北京市工业劳动模范  刘德珍
    我十四岁的时候，就跟我父亲一起进石景山发电厂做工。在旧社会里，我们一天做十几个钟头的沉重的工作，有时甚至连续做三、四十个钟头的工作，但是得到的却是奴役和耻辱。日本帝国主义者拿皮鞭子和东洋刀打过我们，国民党的厂警拿枪托子和刺刀打过我们。我们发出来的电被剥削者拿去享受，而我们却半饿着肚子住在阴暗的房子里。我记得，在敌人压榨得最残酷的时候，在石景山发电厂、石景山钢铁厂和铁路上的工人们之中，每天都有人因连豆饼面也吃不上而丧命，尸体被日本人拖到石景山的小沟里喂野狗。我也曾经看到过劳动了一辈子的老工人被日本人或国民党赶出了工厂，最后在山沟里很悲惨地自杀了。那时候，反正是谁干的活越多，谁就被剥削越多。反动派骂我们做“臭工人”，不把我们看在眼里。旧社会也认为“当工人”是不光采的，没有出息的。对于我们工人来说，劳动就是受活罪，就是被歧视，就是挨饿和死亡。人们把进入工厂当作是不幸的和不得已的事情，生产情绪当然不高。
    解放了，我们工人成为国家和工厂的主人。我们劳动是为了我们工人阶级领导的国家的富强，也就是为了工人阶级和全国人民的幸福。五年来，我们努力劳动，获得了巨大成就，国家正一天天繁荣起来，沿着社会主义道路前进，我们的生活也不断地得到提高。我们工厂建设了巨大的桥型运煤机、机械除灰设备，它们代替了工人的沉重的体力劳动。国家花了不少钱来改善机房的通风设备和保温设备，建设了新式的除尘器，以保护工人的健康。新的职工宿舍也一幢一幢的在山坡上建立起来。
    五年来的许多事实使我们认识到，保证首都的安全用电和降低发电成本，就是为建设伟大的社会主义社会贡献力量。建设社会主义社会是人类最光荣、最庄严的事业，在这个事业中，谁劳动得好，谁贡献大，谁就受人尊敬。劳动竞赛日益开展起来了，克服生产中的困难被认为是最光荣的事情。一九五○年六月的一个晚上，我们厂里有一个煤粉炉内后面保温墙突然倒塌了，为了使它不影响供电，工人凌需木、张文兴、赵崑、郑国太、张春弟等冒着高温钻进炉子去抢修了。炉内灰烟呛眼，四面砖墙滚热，水管炙手，工人脸烤得通红，汗水不停地流着，但精神始终都很旺盛。他们头昏了，出来凉十几分钟后又进去，一直坚持到把炉修理好。
    因为劳动是光荣的，我们便想种种办法来提高劳动的效果。我们在没有增加新的发电设备的情况下，五年来，使发电量增加了一倍多，使耗煤率降低了三分之一。今年，全厂职工保证发电量比去年高百分之十一点一二。在六月十五日和十九日晚上举行的技术革新献礼会上，汽机车间我原先所在的那个小组献出了不拆叶轮拆汽叶的工作法，王世起小组提出了凉油缸不漏油的保证，佟惠增小组献出降低含氧量的经验，运输车间老师傅王春庭保证马上把第一运煤器改为自动的。大家都下决心把自己的智慧和力量贡献出来，以争取国家社会主义工业化的早日实现。
