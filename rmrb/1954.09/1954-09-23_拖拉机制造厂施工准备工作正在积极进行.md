    Preparatory Work for Tractor Factory Construction is Proceeding Vigorously
    New buildings are appearing every day at the construction site of the tractor factory. Temporary dormitories, offices, medical rooms, and a large dining hall covering 14,000 square meters have been built. A five-kilometer-long telephone line connects the various units of the construction site. Two light gray crushed stone roads have been extended to the entrance of the construction site. Every day, hundreds of cars, horse-drawn carts, and wheelbarrows, carrying red bricks, stones, yellow sand, steel bars, and wood, cross the road, raising clouds of smoke-like dust. This year, a large number of building materials will be transported to the construction site. The transport workers have put forward the slogan of "Run fast, load fast, unload fast," striving to load and transport more. In the past, a driver could only make six trips a day, but now some are making nine trips. In order to ensure the completion of the transportation task, railway employees and local laborers are working together to build a dedicated railway line; one day earlier the dedicated line is opened to traffic, the state can save 250 million yuan in material transportation costs. The road construction workers are determined to complete the entire line one month ahead of schedule. Currently, 3 kilometers and 300 meters of rails have been laid for the dedicated line, and the foundation project for a 160-meter-long railway bridge has been completed. Local laborers, in order to support the tractor factory, have built a 17-li long flood control project to protect the construction site from future flood damage. Local relevant departments quickly established a bank, post office, cooperative, department store, and food company at the construction site. Soon, a bustling little market will appear on both sides of the road at the construction site, fully supplying the needs of the workers. Currently, the first batch of permanent dormitory projects for the tractor factory has begun construction, and more than 60,000 square meters of permanent dormitory projects will start construction this year. During the celebration of the National People's Congress session, the workers are determined to build the permanent dormitories well and prepare conditions for the large-scale construction of the tractor factory next year.

    拖拉机制造厂施工准备工作正在积极进行
    拖拉机制造厂工地每天都有新的建筑物出现。已建设起一万四千平方公尺的临时宿舍、办公室、医疗室和大饭厅，五公里长的电话线把工地的各单位联系起来，两条淡灰色的碎石公路已延伸至工地门口。每天几百辆汽车、马车和架子车，载着红砖、石子、黄砂、钢筋和木料越过公路，扬起一道道烟雾般的尘灰。今年要运进工地大批建筑材料，运输工人们提出快跑、快装、快卸的口号，争取多装多运。过去一个司机一天只能跑六趟车，现在有的跑了九趟车。为了保证运输任务的完成，铁路员工们和当地民工共同努力，修筑铁路专用线；专用线提早一天通车，就能给国家节省两亿五千万元的材料运输费。筑路工人决心提前一个月修通全线。现在专用线已铺好三公里三百公尺的铁轨，一座长达一百六十公尺的铁桥的桥台基础工程已竣工。当地民工为了支援拖拉机制造厂，修筑了一条十七华里长的防洪工程，保护工地今后不受洪水的侵袭。当地有关部门，很快地在工地设立了银行、邮局、合作社、百货公司、食品公司，不久工地的公路两旁将出现一座热闹的小市场，充分供应工人的需要。现在拖拉机制造厂第一批永久宿舍工程已开始建筑，今年将有六万多平方公尺的永久宿舍工程开工。工人们在这欢庆全国人民代表大会会议召开的日子里，都决心修好永久宿舍，为明年拖拉机厂大规模施工准备好条件。（陈迹）
