Bo Yong's Speech:

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with Premier Zhou's government work report. I would like to express some opinions on political and legal work.

Over the past five years, following the provisions of the Common Program, we have, after thoroughly destroying the reactionary political structure of the Kuomintang, swiftly established a people's democratic government at all levels, led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants. We have convened local people's congresses at all levels and various strata, and gradually replaced them with people's representative assemblies, electing local people's governments. Especially since 1953, a nationwide democratic election movement of unprecedented scale has been carried out from the bottom up, making people's democracy more substantial and complete. This has further strengthened the bond between the government and the people, consolidating people's democratic dictatorship. The experience of political construction over the past five years has proven that wherever democracy is genuinely promoted, where all major issues of the people's government are submitted to the people's congresses or people's representative assemblies for discussion, and where criticism and self-criticism are fully conducted in meetings and small groups, the enthusiasm and creativity of the people can be unleashed, the government's work can be vibrant, and bureaucratic mistakes can be minimized or avoided.

However, before the universal election movement, some local state organs often used the excuse of being busy to avoid convening people's representative assemblies as required by the central government and local work needs. Instead, they preferred to convene cadre meetings. In some places, even when the conditions for people's representative assemblies to exercise the functions of people's congresses were met, they did not allow them to do so. In some places, although people's representative assemblies and people's congresses were convened, democracy was not fully promoted. Major issues that should have been discussed were not seriously discussed, the will of the masses was not fully concentrated, and resolutions were merely formally passed. This resulted in the enthusiasm and creativity of the people not being fully unleashed, and certain bureaucratic tendencies and errors in some work not being corrected in a timely manner. They did not realize that the power of our state belongs to the people, and the organs through which the people exercise state power are the people's congresses or people's representative assemblies that exercise the functions of people's congresses. They did not realize that the people's congress system is the best organizational form for the working class to lead the state and for concentrating the will and strength of the people. It must be pointed out that in our people's democratic state, any phenomenon that does not respect people's democratic rights and violates people's democratic system is unacceptable. In the past tense war environment, in order to execute various urgent tasks in a timely manner, we mainly relied on the direct mobilization of the masses based on the high level of revolutionary enthusiasm and political awareness of the masses. Therefore, it was understandable that we could not adopt a more complete democratic form to solve various major issues. However, when it is possible to adopt a more complete democratic form and the state has regulations, the practice of handling issues in a simple manner is completely inappropriate and illegal.

Some local state organ workers lack the spirit of self-criticism. Instead of honestly reporting their work to the people's representative assemblies or people's congresses and accepting scrutiny and criticism, they regard themselves as heroes, only talk about achievements, not about shortcomings, only want to be praised, and do not want to be criticized. When the people criticize the work of state organs, they often use the excuse that others do not understand the work situation to reject the people's opinions; some even suppress and retaliate against critics. This seriously harms the political enthusiasm of the people and affects the timely improvement of the work of state organs. They do not understand that the people's congress not only has the right to make decisions on all major issues but also has the right to criticize and supervise the work of state organs and any state organ workers. State organ workers only have the obligation to accept the criticism and supervision of the people and do not have the right to reject and resist criticism and supervision. Any behavior that covers up shortcomings and errors and resists criticism is wrong. State organ workers suppressing and retaliating against critics is not only wrong but also a criminal act that is absolutely unacceptable.

All the above shortcomings and errors, although we have criticized and corrected them repeatedly in the past, have not been completely overcome. In the future, we must continue to correct them in our work, further promote the superiority of the people's congress system, ensure the implementation of the Constitution, and ensure the smooth progress of socialist construction and socialist transformation.

Over the past five years, people's democratic legal system has been gradually established and improved along with the development and consolidation of people's democratic political system.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, according to the provisions of the Common Program, we first thoroughly abolished all laws, decrees, and judicial systems that oppressed the people by the reactionary Kuomintang government. We then formulated the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China, the Land Reform Law, the Trade Union Law, the Regulations on the Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries, the Regulations on the Suppression of Corruption, and many other laws and decrees that protect the people. At the same time, we systematically and step by step established various people's judicial systems. In the process of establishing and improving revolutionary legal systems, we have continuously strengthened the state's public security organs, procuratorial organs, and judicial organs, effectively guaranteeing the smooth progress of social reform movements and economic construction work. It has been proven that revolutionary legal systems are decisive in maintaining revolutionary order, consolidating people's democratic dictatorship, protecting the democratic rights and legal interests of the people, and guaranteeing national economic construction.

Our revolutionary legal systems have also been established and improved in the struggle against various erroneous tendencies.

Our judicial organs had serious organizational and ideological purity issues in the previous period. Many former judicial personnel had strong old legal concepts, which were actually the legal concepts of the reactionary ruling class that oppressed and exploited the people. Their thoughts were permeated with the absurd theory of the bourgeoisie that law is super-class and super-political, and they did not understand that people's law is to serve the people. At the same time, they followed the old judicial practices of isolated case handling, cumbersome procedures, and harassing the masses in their judicial business, and even distorted right and wrong and made wrong judgments, which seriously affected the relationship between people's judicial organs and the masses. Some cadres had unstable positions and were influenced by reactionary old legal concepts, leading to the distortion of people's law, the inability to distinguish between friends and enemies, and the blurring of the principles of new and old laws. In order to effectively implement revolutionary legal systems, we have carried out a struggle against old legal concepts and old judicial practices. After this struggle, the organization and work style of people's judicial organs at all levels have improved significantly. However, it must be pointed out that the residual old legal concepts have not been completely eradicated. They still influence us from time to time and need to be struggled against for a long time to be thoroughly eliminated.

Our laws are formulated based on the needs of revolutionary struggles in various periods and the summary of struggle experience. At the beginning of the founding of the People's Republic of China, some people advocated formulating a complete and detailed set of laws at that time, which was a subjective and unrealistic idea. Because at that time, in military actions and leading the broad masses of the people to carry out land reform, suppress counterrevolutionaries, and other social reform movements, we could only formulate some single and general laws and decrees based on needs and possibilities, and summarize the mature experience. It was impossible and inappropriate to subjectively and rigidly formulate a complete set of laws. If we insisted on doing so, the result would only be unrealistic and would only bind the hands and feet of the masses. We, of course, could not do this. However, this does not mean that we could not or should not gradually formulate some laws suitable for the situation at that time in the past. Those opinions are wrong, and we have criticized them many times. In fact, we not only formulated the Common Program, which served as a provisional constitution at the beginning of the founding of the country, but also formulated many regulations based on the Common Program and the actual situation, gradually establishing a people's democratic legal system. This point I have mentioned before. Now that the country has entered the period of planned construction, our Constitution has been promulgated, and in the future, we not only can but must gradually formulate more complete laws to effectively guarantee national construction and protect the democratic rights of the people.

Some cadres do not fully understand the seriousness of the law, do not act according to the law, and do not use legal weapons to fight against illegal and criminal phenomena. For example, in economic construction, accidents often only focus on political accidents and rarely pursue responsibility accidents; at the same time, for responsibility accidents, they often only focus on simple education and rarely use necessary legal sanctions to more effectively eliminate and prevent illegal and criminal phenomena. Some cadres are arrogant and do not take the state's laws and decrees seriously, thinking that laws are for the common people, as if they themselves do not need to follow them, and that breaking the law is not a big deal. This thought is extremely wrong.

To guarantee the smooth progress of socialist construction and socialist transformation, to protect the democratic rights and legal interests of the people from being infringed upon, and to further strengthen political and legal work, it has become an important task for us at present. At present, in some cadres, due to the achievements made in land reform, suppression of counterrevolutionaries, judicial reform, and other work, a sense of complacency and self-satisfaction has grown, which must be corrected. Some cadres do not understand the correct relationship between political and legal work and economic construction. They ignore the decisive role of political and legal work in guaranteeing socialist economic construction and mistakenly believe that the country only needs to focus on economic construction and does not need to strengthen political and legal work. It must be pointed out that in the period of socialist economic construction, it is completely correct to attach importance to economic construction work. However, in the situation where imperialism and domestic class struggle still exist, without the strengthening and development of political and legal work, we cannot guarantee our economic construction and the socialist industrialization of the country. The essence of the erroneous thought mentioned above is a manifestation of low class consciousness, which must also be corrected.

Ulanfu's Speech:

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with and enthusiastically support Premier Zhou's government work report.

Under the leadership of the Central People's Government, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has implemented regional autonomy. The Mongolian people, like the people of other nationalities, have realized their right to self-governance, strengthened national unity, cultivated a large number of national cadres, and relatively smoothly carried out various tasks, achieving good results. We have carried out land reform and other necessary social reforms according to the characteristics of the autonomous region and the demands of the people of various nationalities, restored and developed various forms of production. The total industrial output value of state-owned enterprises in the entire region, with 1949 as the base year, has increased to 516 in 1952, and according to this year's plan, it will increase to 1,322. The grain production in the entire region in 1953 has exceeded the highest production in the pre-liberation period by 25%, and this year's grain production is estimated to reach over 335 million jin. The number of livestock in the entire region, with 1949 as the base year, has increased to 213 in 1953. This year's livestock number is estimated to reach over 18.6 million. The timber logging volume in the forest industry, with 1949 as the base year, has increased to 660 in 1953. The state-owned and cooperative commercial networks have spread to vast rural and pastoral areas. With the restoration and development of production, the cultural and health work of the people has also made significant progress. In 1953, the entire region had 590,000 primary school students, an increase of 95% over 1949; 33,392 secondary school students, an increase of 238% over 1949; there were no higher education institutions in the past, but now there are two higher education institutions with 854 students. Through active prevention and treatment of plague and other diseases, and the widespread prevention and treatment of syphilis in most pastoral areas, the population in the pastoral areas has stopped declining and has begun to increase, presenting a prosperous scene of both people and livestock. The significant improvement in the political, economic, and cultural life of the Inner Mongolian people fully proves the superiority of the regional autonomy system. It is indeed the key to solving the national question in our country.

In the period of national planned economic construction, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has entered a new period of focusing on the construction of the autonomous region. In the future, the basic task of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is: according to the overall task of the country in the transitional period, in accordance with the specific situation and characteristics of the autonomous region, to gradually carry out socialist construction and socialist transformation.

In the agricultural areas, 40 state farms and 1 tractor station have been established, and agricultural production mutual aid and cooperative organizations have been vigorously developed. The entire region has established 1,326 agricultural production cooperatives, and it is estimated that by the spring of 1955, there will be 6,000, with various mutual aid groups totaling 118,000, organizing about 70% of the total number of farmers.

The restoration and development of Inner Mongolia's animal husbandry have implemented policies such as free grazing, no struggle, no division, no class distinction, and mutual benefit between herdsmen and herdsmen workers. Through various specific measures to increase and protect livestock, animal husbandry has been developed, and the awareness of herdsmen has been improved. We now have the conditions to gradually implement socialist transformation of animal husbandry through mutual aid and cooperation. At present, the entire region has established 17 state farms, and there are 4,960 various mutual aid and cooperative organizations among herdsmen, and 3 pastoral production cooperatives have been experimented with. In the future, we will continue to carry out in-depth and detailed work through mutual aid and cooperation. We are confident that we can gradually transform the current individual and backward pastoral economy into a socialist pastoral economy over a considerable period.

In the past, due to the national oppression policy of the reactionary ruling class, there were conflicts and contradictions between the agricultural areas and pastoral areas, and between farmers and herdsmen in land issues and agricultural and pastoral production. In the process of implementing regional autonomy and socialist transformation, we have organized mutual support between agricultural and pastoral areas, organized agricultural and pastoral production mutual aid groups and production cooperatives, and this has transformed the past contradictions into mutual support relationships. The economic interests of the Mongolian and Han peoples and other brother nationalities have also been combined on the basis of voluntary mutual benefit. In the actual life of the new production relations of mutual aid and cooperation, we deeply experience the importance of various nationalities uniting, helping each other, and developing together, which promotes and strengthens the new national relations of equality, friendship, mutual assistance, and close unity among various nationalities.

In the future, with the development of the economy in the pastoral areas, through state-owned and cooperative commerce, we will first establish primary markets with trade as the main focus, gradually forming political, economic, and cultural comprehensive centers - towns on the grasslands, which will further promote the development of the pastoral economy and gradually change the backward face of the grasslands.

The construction of the Baotou steel industrial base is a major measure for the country to implement socialist industrialization. To serve the key construction of the country, we have vigorously developed the building materials industry and other industries, and we will also mobilize a great deal of strength to actively support it. The masses near the mining area have shown their enthusiasm for supporting the industrial construction of the motherland. They enthusiastically report minerals, help the drilling team solve problems such as water and accommodation. In the future, we will continue to educate the people with this patriotic spirit and fully support the construction of the Baotou steel industrial base.

The establishment and development of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is a brilliant victory of the national policy of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao. It is the result of the help of the Han people and the joint efforts and struggles of the people of all nationalities in the entire region. However, there are still many shortcomings and errors in our work that need to be overcome.

Firstly, the propaganda and education of the national policy are not deep enough. In some Han cadres, there are still remnants of the erroneous thoughts of great-nation chauvinism, which are manifested in neglecting national language and script work and national forms, and lacking patience in helping to cultivate minority national cadres. Some minority national cadres also have remnants of the erroneous thoughts of local nationalism, not understanding that the help of the Han people is an important guarantee for the development of various undertakings of minority nationalities.

Secondly, there is a tendency of generalization in the leadership of Inner Mongolia's work, neglecting the specific characteristics of the autonomous region. For example, in improving the technical level of the extensive agricultural production in our region and increasing the unit yield, attention is not enough; in animal husbandry production, satisfaction is only with the average increase in the number of livestock, without focusing on the breeding of large livestock such as cattle and horses; in preventing natural disasters, only satisfaction is with the reported figures of grass cutting and storage, without focusing on leading the establishment of feed bases; in state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce, only satisfaction is with the increase in the number of transactions, without sufficient investigation and research on actively supplying production materials according to the needs of farmers and herdsmen and establishing primary markets in rural and pastoral areas in a planned way.

Finally, there are different degrees of bureaucratism in the leading organs of the autonomous region, lacking timely inspection and summary after work arrangements, more general mobilization and less specific guidance, which inevitably breeds the commandist style of work at the grassroots level.

To overcome shortcomings and improve work, we will strive to learn in the future, prevent arrogance, humbly learn from the work experience of various regions, regularly carry out criticism and self-criticism, and sincerely listen to the criticism of the people.

We are very satisfied with the leadership and care of the Central People's Government, but we also feel that some departments have checked and supervised our work less in the past, and therefore have a shallow understanding of the situation in Inner Mongolia. For example, the issue of the establishment of autonomous organs has not been appropriately resolved for a long time. In the future, we need to reflect more specific situations to the central departments and request the central departments to check the work more.

This conference has successfully formulated the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, which is a great guarantee for our country to gradually realize national socialist industrialization and gradually complete socialist transformation, and build our country into a great socialist country. In the future, we will definitely strictly abide by the Constitution, closely unite the people of all nationalities, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government, in the light of the overall task of the country in the transitional period, and with high enthusiasm and initiative of the people of all nationalities in the entire autonomous region, strive to liberate Taiwan, and build our great motherland together.

Li Dequan's Speech:

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with Premier Zhou En-lai's government work report and Comrade Guo Mo-ruo's speech on cultural and educational work. I would now like to supplement some points regarding health work.

Over the past five years, our country's public health work has made significant progress.

First of all, in the field of health and epidemic prevention, significant achievements have been made. The primary task is to prevent cholera, plague, smallpox, and other infectious diseases that are most harmful to the people. In recent years, the country has established 337 health and epidemic prevention stations (teams) and 234 infectious disease prevention and treatment centers (stations, teams), and has organized medical and health personnel from urban and rural areas to carry out vaccination and planned prevention and treatment of cholera, plague, typhoid, diphtheria, and other infectious diseases, as well as disinfection work. Especially since the nationwide Patriotic Hygiene Campaign was launched in 1952, health and epidemic prevention work has made remarkable progress. During this campaign, mass efforts were made to clean up garbage, dredge ditches, fill in cesspools, and eradicate disease-carrying insects such as flies, mosquitoes, lice, fleas, and rats, which significantly reduced the number of flies in some cities and improved the sanitary conditions in urban and rural areas. This campaign not only reduced and controlled the spread of epidemics, improved personal and environmental hygiene, and frustrated the U.S. aggressors' biological warfare, but also raised the public's health awareness, gradually eliminated various unhealthy habits left over from old China, and played a role in changing customs. Taking the most harmful infectious diseases such as plague, smallpox, and cholera as examples: in 1953, the number of cases reported was 90% lower than in 1950, and smallpox was 95% lower. Cholera, which has been prevalent in China since it was introduced from abroad in 1820, has not occurred in the past five years.

Preventive medical work has also developed significantly. Just taking the number of beds in hospitals and sanatoriums under the health administration system in 1953 as an example, it is more than five times the highest number of beds during the Kuomintang rule in 1947. Industrial hygiene work has also made some progress. Just the number of beds in newly built hospitals and sanatoriums under the Central Six Industrial Departments, the Ministry of Railways, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions is 1.27 times the total number of beds in all public hospitals in the country before liberation. Health work has also played a significant role in water conservancy, road construction, basic construction, and other projects. Maternal and child health work has also been greatly developed, and the mortality rates of mothers and infants have been significantly reduced. The health conditions in minority national areas have also been significantly improved, and the mortality rate from diseases has been decreasing, and the population has been gradually increasing.

After the floods in Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, and other provinces this year, to prevent the outbreak of serious epidemics, health departments across the country immediately provided strong support. In Anhui Province alone, the central, regional, and local people's governments organized 5,900 health personnel to serve the affected areas, reducing the threat of various diseases caused by the floods to the people in the affected areas.

Currently, there are 31 higher medical and pharmaceutical schools nationwide, with 29,000 students; 220 secondary medical and pharmaceutical schools, with 57,000 students. Since liberation, the number of graduates from higher and secondary medical and pharmaceutical schools has far exceeded the total number of high-level and mid-level medical personnel trained in old China. The continuous growth of new medical talents is a major guarantee for the development of our country's health work.

Although the achievements of our country's health work in the past five years have been significant, there are also many shortcomings and errors in our work. Due to our insufficient understanding of the great significance of developing our country's socialist industry, the health department did not list industrial hygiene work as one of its primary tasks, resulting in many factory and mine hygiene works still being very weak, and occupational diseases and common diseases still seriously affecting workers' health and production. We have taken an indifferent attitude towards our country's precious medical heritage and have not seriously studied it; we have not fully recognized the importance of the large number of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners and their role in public health work, and therefore have adopted erroneous attitudes of contempt, discrimination, and exclusion towards traditional Chinese medicine, seriously affecting the role of traditional Chinese medicine. We have not closely combined the Patriotic Hygiene Campaign with the people's production and life, and have proposed overly high and numerous requirements, and often have not specifically explained policies in work, resulting in the phenomenon of commandism in many places, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. In medical education work, we have overemphasized short-term rapid training and the role of specialized focus, and have not paid enough attention to regular higher medical education that adapts to the long-term needs of the country. We have lacked specific leadership and serious rectification of urban medical care, resulting in chaotic systems and low efficiency, and many forces have not been fully utilized, etc. These shortcomings and errors are manifestations of health work being detached from the masses and detached from reality, and are the result of weak political leadership. In some aspects, they are the specific manifestations of bourgeois ideology in health work. They have brought great losses to public health work. Although these shortcomings and errors have been gradually corrected under the timely instructions of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, we must make serious efforts in the future to thoroughly transform them and quickly eliminate the obstacles in the way of health work.

Based on the overall task of the country in the transitional period and the basic tasks of the Five-Year Plan, the future guidelines and tasks of health work are to continue to implement the four principles of "facing workers, peasants, and soldiers," "prevention first," "uniting traditional and Western medicine," and "combining health work with mass movements" on the basis of existing work. The current primary task is to strengthen industrial hygiene and improve urban medical care, and to gradually develop rural health work in combination with the mutual aid and cooperative movement. At the same time, we must continue to carry out the Patriotic Hygiene Campaign and fight against infectious diseases that are most harmful to people's health, and through overcoming diseases and improving health, we must ensure the smooth progress of the great construction of our motherland. For this, we must seriously do the following work:

First, continue to carry out the Patriotic Hygiene Campaign. This is the most effective way to prevent diseases and improve people's health. In the future, we must continue to vigorously carry out this campaign on the principle of combining production, and gradually raise and regularize it. We must prevent and overcome the tendencies of commandism and laissez-faire at any time.

Second, strengthen industrial hygiene and urban and rural medical care. Industrial hygiene must continue to strengthen leadership, improve grassroots organizations, actively rely on the masses of workers, and prevent and treat common and occupational diseases; urban and rural medical care must be further rectified and improved, and on the basis of consolidating the existing foundation, it must be appropriately developed. We must continue to vigorously develop maternal and child health and health work in minority national areas. Currently, we must also pay special attention to health work in disaster-stricken areas.

Third, strengthen the unity of traditional and Western medicine. The principle of uniting traditional and Western medicine and calling on traditional and Western medicine to learn from each other must be implemented. The current key issue is to immediately correct all contemptuous, discriminatory, and exclusionary views and practices towards traditional Chinese medicine, improve traditional Chinese medicine work, unite and utilize the strength of traditional Chinese medicine. The current key is to mobilize and organize Western medicine to learn and study Chinese medical heritage, and under the cooperation of traditional and Western medicine, systematically organize and promote Chinese medical heritage.

Fourth, continue to vigorously cultivate medical and health personnel. In the future, medical education should focus on running higher medical education well. For this, we must further seriously learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, continue to carry out teaching reforms, and improve teaching quality. We must strengthen Marxism-Leninism education in schools to cultivate specialized personnel with socialist ideology and certain advanced medical knowledge and skills.

With the continuous development of national construction and the continuous improvement of people's economic life, the tasks of health work will become increasingly important and arduous. The current achievements have only laid a preliminary foundation. Health workers must not have any complacency. Health work is a broad mass undertaking with all the people as its service object, and it can only achieve greater development under the active support and supervision of the broad masses. We hope that all representatives and the people of the whole country will continue to give us health workers strict criticism and guidance in the future.

Bo Yi's Speech:

Fellow representatives:

I fully agree with and enthusiastically support Premier Zhou's government work report. I would now like to supplement some points regarding transportation and postal work.

Transportation and postal work, like other national economic sectors, have gone through stages of recovery and development. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Party and the government have paid great attention to the improvement and development of transportation and postal work. Therefore, whether in the great War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea or in the recovery and development of the national economy, transportation and postal work have played a huge role.

Since liberation, 9,534 kilometers of main railway lines damaged by long-term warfare have been repaired, and new main railway lines such as Chongqing-Chengdu, Tianzhu-Lanzhou, and Lianbian-Munan Pass have been built, totaling 2,740 kilometers. The Chengdu-Guangyuan line connecting the southwestern part of China is expected to be laid with tracks from Chengdu to Guangyuan by the end of this year. To develop the vast political, economic, and cultural regions of northwestern China, the Lanzhou-Xinjiang line is currently being built westward through the Wushaoling Mountains. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge has also started construction in 1953. The Beijing-Shenyang, Harbin-Dalian, Andong-Shenyang, and other double-track lines have been rebuilt and newly built, totaling 997 kilometers. By the end of 1953, the total length of main lines in operation in the country had reached 24,690 kilometers.

The recovery and new construction of highways have also made significant achievements. By the end of 1953, the total length of highways in operation had reached 138,500 kilometers. Most of the newly built lines are main lines connecting the border areas of the motherland and minority national areas, such as the Ya'an-Lhasa, Chengdu-Aba, and Kunming-Fuhai lines. The completion of these highways will promote the development of politics, economy, and culture in minority national areas.

Although our merchant fleet has been severely damaged and plundered by the Kuomintang bandits, it has also developed. In 1953, compared to 1949, the tonnage of ships increased by 107.6%.

The civil aviation industry, established on August 1, 1950, had a flight distance of 15,900 kilometers by 1953.

The postal and telecommunications industry is also developing rapidly. In 1953, compared to 1949, postal routes increased by 100.7%, and long-distance telecommunications lines increased by 65.6%.

The achievements of transportation work are also reflected in the completion of the continuously increasing transportation tasks. Taking the turnover volume of railway cargo transportation as an example, if 1950 is taken as 100, the annual growth situation is as follows: 1951 was 130.8, 1952 was 152.6, and 1953 was 197.2. In just three years, the cargo volume of railways has increased by nearly onefold, which not only reflects the rapid recovery and development of our country's economy but also correspondingly proves that the load of railways is increasing day by day.

The above achievements are inseparable from the enthusiastic support of the people across the country. The people in various places have actively participated in the construction and maintenance of large-scale projects such as railways, highways, waterways, ports, and telecommunications lines. These achievements are also inseparable from the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers, especially from their learning of advanced management methods and advanced technology from the Soviet Union. In recent years, a large number of advanced technical innovators and labor models have emerged. They have all played a great role in the production process, demonstrating their creativity and vanguard role. Their model deeds and advanced work methods are being widely promoted and implemented in the transportation and postal industries, and are playing and will continue to play a huge role in promoting production.

In the past five years, the achievements of the transportation and postal departments have been significant, completing the tasks assigned by the state, but there are also many shortcomings and errors, mainly in the following areas:

We have an insufficient understanding of the rule that the scale and speed of socialist economic construction in our country will inevitably lead to a surge in business volume, and we lack the necessary foresight and preparation for the problem of the backwardness of existing transportation and postal facilities not matching the speed of national economic development. This is more evident in railway work, on the one hand, it is reflected in the insufficient attention to the regular maintenance and repair of fixed assets, on the other hand, it is reflected in the failure to propose the technical transformation of existing facilities earlier. The transportation industry is a complex department in the national economy, transportation workers not only need to be familiar with the capacity of transportation facilities but also need to understand the various aspects of national economic development, only in this way can they foresee and prevent difficulties, but we still lack this knowledge.

In management and operation, we have not yet fully tapped the potential of existing facilities, we have not further implemented the economy system from the improvement of production technology operations, and we lack systematic organizational work in reducing enterprise costs. Train and water transportation accidents are still serious.

According to the types, flow, transportation distance, and distribution of various transportation tools, organizing the division of labor and joint transportation among various transportation tools can better utilize the effectiveness of various existing transportation facilities. In the past, we also lacked research on this issue and did not seriously organize it.

In terms of train and ship fares and postal and telecommunications charges, there are still many unreasonable aspects, which cannot fully reflect the requirements of our country's socialist industrialization and socialist transformation. It is necessary to gradually adjust them according to the basic principles of promoting national economic development, encouraging the more reasonable distribution of national productive forces, and accumulating funds for the state.

In passenger transportation, due to the insufficient number of trains and ships and the imperfect organization, during the peak season and some sections, we still cannot fully meet the needs of passengers, and the service attitude towards passengers is also not yet satisfactory.

As mentioned above, our country's transportation and postal work has made achievements in the past few years, and the transportation industry is executing the national transportation plan and is basically able to meet the needs of the national economy and the people for transportation at present. However, if we do not see that due to the rapid development of the national economy, the current transportation work is already quite tense, we will make a serious mistake. That is to say, when we consider that the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production will continue to bring a huge volume of transportation, if we do not take timely measures to correspondingly improve the transportation capacity, transportation will very likely become a "narrow neck" for the development of the national economy.

The main way to improve transportation capacity is to tap the potential of railways, water transportation, and highway transportation, rationally use national transportation power, and gradually carry out technical transformation of our country's existing transportation facilities.

Accelerating the turnover time of trains and ships is of decisive significance for tapping the potential of transportation, because the shortening of the turnover time of trains and ships can save more trains and ships, and can complete more transportation tasks. Taking railways as an example: in the first half of 1954, the time spent on the road in the vehicle turnover time was only 28%, while 72% of the time was spent at stations for loading, unloading, marshalling, shunting, coupling, refueling, and watering. It should be admitted that we can still squeeze out some time from the station stay time.

Rationally using national transportation tools, gradually eliminating long-distance, short-distance, cross-flow, and other economically unprincipled transportation, is the main method to save national transportation power and reduce transportation costs. Everyone knows that transportation costs account for a large proportion of the total value of products. For example, in 1953, the transportation costs of various departments on railways were approximately 110 billion yuan. If we can reduce some unreasonable transportation by 10%, we can save 11 billion yuan for the state. The coal distribution and transportation method of rational allocation and reasonable transportation currently being tested must be gradually promoted to other materials.

Balancing the completion of the national transportation plan is the common task of various departments of the national economy. In addition to the transportation department timely transporting according to the plan, various shipping units must also propose plans on time and ship according to the plan, gradually eliminating the phenomenon of not shipping or under-shipping at the beginning of the year and the beginning of the month, and proposing a large number of shipments at the end of the year and the end of the month that the transportation department cannot bear.

The technical transformation of our country's transportation and postal work is to rationally use national investment, according to business needs and the level of industrial development in our country, to transform our country's transportation and postal facilities with new technology, so that they gradually catch up with the advanced technical standards of the Soviet Union. According to the preliminary research results, the technical transformation of railways should be based on the principle of increasing the weight of trains and improving the density of trains. Gradually increase the number of large locomotives, and in areas lacking coal, water, and large slopes, consider using diesel locomotives or electric locomotives; increase large vehicles; strengthen the equipment of locomotive and vehicle repair factories; gradually replace the mixed-type steel rails and light rails on the main lines with heavy-type steel rails, increase the thickness of ballast and the number of sleepers; gradually increase the number of stations, lay double tracks, install automatic signals; expand and rebuild stations, increase station lines, and build new mechanical hump yards; increase the proportion of mechanical loading and unloading of goods. In terms of water transportation, it is necessary to gradually build new ships, increase the mechanical equipment of ports, build new ports, dredge waterways, build navigation marks, and establish new ship repair bases, and transform existing ship repair factories with new technology.

Due to the small number of railways in our country and their distribution in only about 20% of the country's area, it is necessary to plan the construction of new railway lines. In recent years, the people in various places have often enthusiastically suggested to Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government to build more new railways, which is understandable. However, the large-scale construction of new railways, on the one hand, must be adapted to the level of heavy industry development in our country, and on the other hand, a large amount of funds and technical personnel are still needed, so the construction of new lines cannot be quick, but it can be said that new railways will definitely increase year by year.

It is necessary to gradually increase the number of cars and build new highways and improve the existing highways according to the development of the automobile manufacturing industry and the petroleum industry in our country. For the local transportation construction projects voluntarily built by the people in various places, active support and assistance should be given.

In the future, the task of postal work is to improve management, improve quality, and build new postal institutions accordingly, gradually adopt new technologies and advanced communication equipment, strengthen the main lines, and cooperate with the construction of industrial cities.

The above are the work that the transportation and postal departments are already carrying out and will continue to carry out in the future.

The tasks of the transportation and postal departments are the same as those of other national economic departments, that is, to struggle to build our country into a great socialist country and to improve the material and cultural living standards of the people. Here, it is also clearly reflected that our Party and government's policy of peace. However, at the same time, the transportation and postal departments are also ready to undertake their own responsibilities at any time to defend the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and security of the country. We believe that under the leadership of the Party and the government, all the staff of the transportation and postal departments will, with unparalleled enthusiasm and creativity, complete the tasks entrusted by the people.

Nie Rongzhen's Speech:

Fellow representatives:

I fully agree with Premier Zhou En-lai's government work report.

Over the past five years, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, and with the united efforts of the people across the country, our great motherland has achieved brilliant results in political, economic, cultural, and national defense construction, and has made great contributions to the cause of lasting world peace. The people of the whole country are following the overall task of the country in the transitional period proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, uniting as one, full of confidence, and advancing towards the great goal of building a socialist society.

Over the past five years, the People's Liberation Army of China, following the instructions of the Seventh Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, has carried out the tasks of a combat army and a working army. With the love and support of the people across the country, it has, with the force of moving mountains and rivers, liberated the mainland, annihilated the remaining Kuomintang reactionary troops on the mainland, eliminated bandits, and laid the foundation for national unity and social stability. In the new liberated areas, it has participated in mobilizing the people, completing democratic reforms, organizing the people to restore industrial and agricultural production, consolidating people's democratic dictatorship, and other glorious tasks. During this period, a part of the People's Liberation Army of China has been collectively demobilized and directly participated in the large-scale socialist economic construction work in industry, railways, transportation, water conservancy, agriculture, and other fields.

Over the past five years, the People's Liberation Army of China, following Chairman Mao's instructions: "We will not only have a powerful land army but also a powerful air force and a powerful navy," has made great achievements in modernization. Now we not only have a powerful land army and various technical troops but also have a relatively solid air force and navy. This powerful and tempered people's armed forces, which have inherited and carried forward the glorious traditions of the People's Liberation Army, are becoming stronger day by day and have become a reliable guarantee for liberating Taiwan, completing the great cause of liberation of the Chinese people, and defending the socialist construction of the motherland. The socialist industrialization of the motherland, under the great and selfless aid of the Soviet Union, progresses one step further, providing better conditions for our military modernization.

It should be pointed out that when the United States imperialists invaded the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, occupied our Taiwan, and threatened our security, the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people organized the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and fought side by side with the heroic Korean People's Army, severely defeating the U.S. imperialist army and its puppet army, and achieving the great victory of the Korean armistice. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army has inherited and carried forward the glorious traditions of the People's Liberation Army of China and has enriched the People's Liberation Army of China with its precious experience in fighting against U.S. imperialism. Undoubtedly, the great contribution made by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is an important part of the precious assets of the Chinese people's armed forces and has great significance for the modernization of the People's Liberation Army of China.

The People's Liberation Army of China is soberly aware of the environment in which the motherland is located and the tasks it bears. Although the Korean War has long since ended and peace has been restored in Indochina, the U.S. aggression group is not reconciled to its defeat. To create a new tense situation, expand its armed intervention and war threats against our country, it continues to occupy our territory of Taiwan, and further intensifies the use of the Kuomintang traitor group that fled to Taiwan to carry out sabotage and war of harassment against our mainland and coastal areas, and plots to sign a so-called "bilateral security treaty" with the Kuomintang traitor group. Not long ago, the Manila Conference convened by the United States signed the so-called "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" that is hostile to Asia and the Chinese people, which poses a serious threat to the security of our country and the peace of Asia. Premier Zhou En-lai's foreign affairs report at the 33rd meeting of the Standing Committee of the Central People's Government clearly expounded this situation and proposed the tasks of liberating Taiwan and consolidating peace. The joint declaration of all democratic parties and people's organizations for the liberation of Taiwan solemnly declared that the people of the whole country will definitely liberate Taiwan, eliminate the Kuomintang traitor group, and thoroughly complete the great cause of liberation and unification of the motherland. The will of the people is the will of the People's Liberation Army, and it is the guarantee of the victory of the People's Liberation Army. The people of the whole country know that the People's Liberation Army of China has never disappointed the people's expectations.

The achievements of military work in the past five years are great, but there are still many shortcomings in our work that need to be overcome, and there are also many fundamental issues that need to be solved. Because modern military construction, although it is important to reform the equipment of weapons and equipment, it is not just a problem of reforming the equipment of weapons and equipment, but a great historical transition from a low level to a high level, which will inevitably lead to a series of reforms in organization and system. Here, I will only talk about the following two issues.

First, the issue of the conscription system. In the past period of domestic revolutionary war, the voluntary conscription system that correctly guaranteed the victory of the people's revolution was no longer appropriate and could not continue. Instead, it should be replaced by a new compulsory conscription system. The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulated: "Prepare to implement the compulsory conscription system at an appropriate time." With the completion of social reform and democratic reform, the improvement of the political awareness of the people, and the consolidation of people's democratic dictatorship, the implementation of the compulsory conscription system is now not only an urgent need for modern military construction but also a common demand of the people. Because if the compulsory conscription system is not implemented, it will be impossible to prepare a certain number of trained reserve forces for the state; it will be impossible to further reduce the number of regular troops of the state, save national financial expenditure; it will be impossible to solve a series of problems such as the service, treatment, marriage, and family of soldiers, which will affect the combat effectiveness of the troops and increase the difficulty of demobilization and transfer. At the same time, it is unreasonable to let only a few volunteers serve in the army while the vast majority of people cannot fulfill their duty of military service and cannot enjoy the right to improve their political awareness, learn military technology, improve their cultural level, and strengthen their physique in the great socialist school of the People's Liberation Army of China. Therefore, we hope that the "Defense of the motherland is the sacred duty of every citizen of the People's Republic of China. Serving in the army according to law is the glorious duty of every citizen of the People's Republic of China" as stipulated in the Constitution can be promulgated and implemented as soon as possible.

Of course, the initial implementation of the compulsory conscription system is not without difficulties. These difficulties are mainly due to our lack of experience in the conscription system. The conscription of the reactionary ruling class in history is to conscript soldiers, which still has harmful influences in some people. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the education of patriotism among the people and the superiority of the compulsory conscription system, and to do a good job of meticulous organizational preparation.

Second, with the implementation of the compulsory conscription system, it is also necessary to formulate the service system of officers and solve the treatment of professional soldiers. In the past period of domestic revolutionary war, the People's Liberation Army of China implemented a long-term supply system, which was correct. Because at that time our army could not receive military funds from the unified state power treasury, but had to rely on self-raising funds, self-production, or only rely on the public grain paid by farmers to maintain military funds. In the five years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, we have maintained the supply system, which is also correct. Because the state in the transitional period still had to carry out the war to eliminate the remaining Kuomintang reactionary troops and bandits on the mainland, carry out large-scale social reforms and production recovery work, and also because the compulsory conscription system had not been implemented. Now it is necessary and possible to replace the supply system with a salary system for professional soldiers in the army. If the salary system is not implemented, then officers who take military work as their profession will not be able to support their families with their salaries, increasing their concerns about family life; at the same time, the waste, egalitarianism, and marriage restrictions generated by the supply system have already become obstacles to military construction. While the implementation of the salary system can overcome waste, encourage progress, and is beneficial to military construction. Of course, the professional soldiers of the People's Liberation Army of China fully understand that the state must concentrate its strength on socialist industrialization construction, and the people of the whole country must tighten their belts to accumulate funds for industrialization, so in a certain period, the salary system can only be a low-salary system. We hope that the Central People's Government will promulgate and implement the salary system for professional soldiers in the army as soon as possible.

The convening of the National People's Congress will have a great mobilizing and inspiring effect on the People's Liberation Army of China. The People's Liberation Army of China will, under the command of the President of the People's Republic of China, and under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, continue to carry forward the fine traditions of hard work, bravery, unity, discipline, overcoming difficulties, and perseverance, strive to learn from Soviet military science, strengthen political and military training, master modern military technology, and build a strong modern revolutionary army. We will resolutely complete the glorious tasks entrusted by the people of the whole country to liberate Taiwan, eliminate the Kuomintang traitor group, defend the socialist construction of the motherland, and defend the peace of Asia and the world. The Chinese people who have stood up will never allow any imperialist to invade our territory again!

Shao Xianghua's Speech:

Chairman, fellow representatives:

We have listened to Premier Zhou's report on the government's work. This report correctly points out the brilliant achievements made by the people of our country under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao in the great task of safeguarding peace and building a socialist society in the past few years, and also points out the direction of efforts for the people of the whole country in the future. Please allow me to express my most enthusiastic support for Premier Zhou's report!

As an engineering and technical personnel working at the first iron and steel base in the country, Anshan Iron and Steel Company, I deeply feel the great significance of the Party and the government's policy of concentrating the main force on developing heavy industry and gradually realizing the socialist industrialization of the country. During the Japanese occupation, the highest annual output of pig iron was more than 130 million tons; now we have only opened part of the blast furnaces, but the output has reached 150 million tons. In terms of steel, we have only opened the smaller of the two steel plants, but this year's steel ingot output will exceed the highest total annual output of the two plants by about 19%. Many of the original rolling mills have production capacities that have reached or even exceeded twice or three times the highest records of the puppet Manchukuo. New large-scale rolling mills, seamless steel pipe plants, and sheet plants, as well as many old plants, are producing new varieties of steel. Due to the adoption of Soviet technical standards, the quality of products has been improved compared to the past. These are the victories of the Party's general line and the results of the correct leadership of the Central People's Government.

In the old China, many of us also had beautiful dreams of developing heavy industry. We believed in "industrial salvation" and hoped to save China's backwardness with our little technical ability. At that time, we did not know that the reactionary social system was the fundamental obstacle to the development of industry. Many "industrial salvation" dreams ended in failure. Only after the Communist Party led the Chinese people to overthrow the dark reactionary rule and established the People's Republic of China, led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants, did we engineering and technical personnel have the opportunity to work with workers to give full play to our creativity and enthusiasm. We see that the dreams that could not be realized in the old society are now becoming a reality, and we feel inexplicable excitement and joy.

The achievements of Anshan in the past few years are inseparable from the aid of the Soviet Union. Our workers and technical personnel have learned from Soviet experts with great enthusiasm and have gradually mastered advanced technology. This has enabled several large new plants to be built and put into production quickly and smoothly. In the original plants and mines, many technical innovations have been completed under the help of Soviet experts, significantly improving production, quality, and working conditions.

The support from all over the country has also created conditions for the recovery and development of Anshan.

But in our work, there are still many shortcomings and problems. Especially in technical management, there is still a certain degree of chaos at present. The responsibilities of technical and production cadres at all levels are not clear, the normal production order has not been fully established, and therefore, there are still considerable fluctuations in production, quality, and the completion of production according to the order. This naturally affects the work of the ordering units and is not beneficial to the national economy as a whole. The Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government has proposed to strengthen technical management as the central work for the next period, which I feel is very timely and necessary. I hope that the Ministry of Heavy Industry will strengthen specific leadership in this central work.

We have successfully completed the drafting of the first constitution of our advance towards socialism. The engineering and technical personnel of Anshan will work with all employees to complete the production and construction tasks assigned by the first Five-Year Plan, supplying more and better steel to various places, and striving for the liberation of Taiwan and the realization of the socialist industrialization of the motherland.

Chen Shaokuan's Speech:

Chairman, fellow representatives and comrades:

I represent the people of Fujian Province and the Provincial People's Government to express our complete agreement and enthusiastic support for Premier Zhou's government work report, and we will strive for the tasks indicated in the report.

The Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao led the national revolution and achieved great victories, establishing the People's Republic of China. In the past five years, we have achieved brilliant achievements both domestically and internationally, which has created favorable conditions for building a socialist society and greatly strengthened and developed the forces of world peace. We thank Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China.

In the summer of 1949, the brave and skilled People's Liberation Army of China marched into Fujian and quickly achieved the great victory of liberating the entire province, annihilating more than 100,000 Kuomintang bandits. In the early days of liberation, there were more than 70,000 bandits in various places in the province, and Taiwan and Kinmen often sent armed special agents and bandits to infiltrate from the sea. After the United States imperialists occupied Taiwan, they frequently instigated the remaining Kuomintang bandits to land and harass the coasts of Fujian. The activities of sea bandits and inland bandits and special agents became more rampant. Therefore, we not only intensified the suppression of bandits but also consolidated the coastal defense. Soon, we eliminated the banditry that had plagued the area for decades, and the people's hearts were settled, and society was stable. Through the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and various social reform work, Fujian, like other places in the country, has achieved remarkable results and great victories in economic recovery and economic construction, making the social face of the entire province completely renewed. The political awareness and production enthusiasm of the people have reached an unprecedented height, people's democratic dictatorship has been further consolidated, and agricultural and industrial production have gradually recovered and developed. The material and cultural life of the people has also been continuously improved. Fujian, which was always short of grain before liberation, has become self-sufficient in grain after land reform, and can even support other regions. Through the propaganda and education of the overall task of the country in the transitional period, the socialist awareness of the people has been greatly improved, and the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation has been further developed. The people of the entire province are striving to implement socialist construction.

The United States imperialists, in collusion with the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, are trying to sign a so-called "bilateral security treaty" and attempt to occupy Taiwan for a long time as a military base for attacking the mainland of China. Taiwan is our territory, and no country is allowed to occupy it, and the Chiang Kai-shek traitor group is not allowed to usurp it. Our compatriots in Taiwan are still in deep water and fire, eagerly awaiting liberation. We must liberate Taiwan. This is the will of 600 million people in the country, especially the demand of the people of Fujian. Fujian is on the front line of coastal defense, only separated from Taiwan by a strait. The people of Fujian have suffered the most from the harm of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and have the deepest hatred for Chiang and his traitor group. Last month, at the Fujian Provincial People's Congress, all representatives unanimously supported the liberation of Taiwan, Kinmen, and coastal islands and expressed their determination to increase production and support the liberation of Kinmen and Taiwan with all their strength. The people of Fujian have been holding high the banner of people's revolution for more than 20 years and have confidence and determination to liberate Taiwan. Since liberation, we have never stopped preparing for the liberation of Taiwan. The people of the entire province are united as one, enthusiastically supporting and striving to complete this sacred historical task. We will further strengthen the unity of the people of the entire province and, together with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, strive to liberate Taiwan and Kinmen to the end.

The Central People's Government's policy towards those who followed the traitor Chiang Kai-shek to Taiwan is lenient: except for Chiang himself, anyone is allowed to turn to the light and return to the mainland to reunite with their families, and anyone can receive the lenient treatment of meritorious service and past offenses not being pursued. The naval personnel and soldiers under the rule of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek should quickly achieve meritorious service and return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible, and do not hesitate to miss the opportunity.

Since the liberation of Fujian, the highways in the entire province have developed significantly, and the causeway between Xiamen and the mainland has been filled, making transportation more convenient and coastal defense more consolidated. However, the sea routes are blocked by the United States imperialists and the Chiang traitor group, and cannot be smooth. The land routes only rely on highway buses, which are not enough. We hope that the central government will speed up the construction of railways in Fujian to make the transportation of Fujian more convenient.

Shen Jilan's Speech:

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I am a family member of a volunteer soldier and the deputy director of the Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry, and Livestock Production Cooperative. I am very satisfied with Premier Zhou's government work report. In the past few years, the government has been very concerned about the liberation of women, the participation of women in labor and production, and participation in social activities; especially for our military families, the care is meticulous. I deeply feel that our government is truly a government of the people.

Our place is an old revolutionary base area. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the policy of gender equality and free marriage was already implemented. Over the past decade, women have participated in mutual aid and cooperative organizations and labor production with men, responding to Chairman Mao's call. In the winter of 1951, our village established an agricultural, forestry, and livestock production cooperative, and women's enthusiasm for production soared. But the production technology was still not as good as men's. The government, in order to improve women's technology and culture, advocated that men teach women; opened short-term training classes to specially train female technicians; established primary schools to improve women's cultural level. I myself was illiterate, but now I can recognize more than 2,000 characters. In this way, women quickly learned how to select seeds, soak seeds, sow, weed, and build dikes, and some even learned how to plow. At the same time, the government, in order to solve the difficulties in women's labor and production, also established maternal and child health stations and midwifery stations in our county, and helped us establish childcare centers during busy farming seasons.

But in the early days of our cooperative, we did not implement the principle of equal pay for equal work. No matter how good a woman worked, she could only get half a workday's pay at most. This is very unreasonable. To fight for equal pay for equal work, we, under the leadership and help of the Communist Party and the people's government, made great efforts and struggles. Through continuous labor competitions, we not only implemented the principle of equal pay for equal work but also improved our socialist awareness and also improved people's understanding of gender equality.

In 1953, women in our cooperative, in addition to household chores, obtained 34% of the workdays in the total of more than 11,000 workdays in a year. This fact shows that to build a socialist society, women's participation is indispensable.

Due to the participation in mutual aid and cooperative organizations and labor production, women's social status has been improved, and their family status has also been improved. In the past, families where women were beaten and scolded and were not harmonious have now become democratic and harmonious new families. No matter what, it can be discussed. Young women all wear printed cloth and cover themselves with printed quilts. We believe that in a socialist society, women's lives will be even happier. I am just one of the thousands of women. Like me, there are many women who have participated in the leadership of production cooperatives. Taking our Shanxi Changzhi Special District as an example, in 15 counties and 3,700 agricultural production cooperatives, there are 9 female directors and 4,003 female deputy directors. Like our cooperative, there are 3 female deputy directors. Women also participate in political power at all levels and manage state affairs. We deeply feel that women, who have been oppressed for thousands of years, can only truly be liberated under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people's government, and Chairman Mao, and only by participating in labor and production and walking the socialist path.

But there are still many shortcomings in our work. For example, when we mobilized women to participate in labor and production, we did not consider women's physical conditions and household chores, and only competed fiercely, which affected women's health and the harmony of the family. Based on my own experience, women's participation in labor and production and the struggle for gender equality have encountered many obstacles in the early and long period. If there is no support from all sides and no effort from women themselves, it will be frustrated and produce pessimistic and disappointed emotions; but once women are mobilized, they are prone to the tendency of overwork. This is a major issue in mobilizing half of the population to participate in socialist construction. Some leading organs in the past did not pay much attention to this issue, resulting in the tendency of women's work and even the inability to be corrected in a timely manner. I hope this will be paid attention to in the future.

Finally, we will, based on Premier Zhou's report and the spirit of this conference, further improve our work. For peace, for socialism, we women will definitely contribute greater efforts.

Lin Tie's Speech:

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with and enthusiastically support Premier Zhou's report and will ensure its resolute implementation.

In the past five years, our country has made great achievements and made leaps and bounds of progress in all aspects. This fully proves the great superiority of our people's democratic dictatorship system. Our country is led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants. Under the people's democratic system, various democratic classes, democratic parties, and people's organizations have formed a broad united front. Our country has adopted the most convenient organizational form for concentrating the will of the people and attracting the people to participate in state management, and all its domestic and foreign policies are aimed at increasing the benefits of the people and consolidating world peace. It practices high democracy for the broad masses of the people, while practicing strict dictatorship for the enemies of the people. All this guarantees that our government is truly of the people and always serves the people. Because of this, any call and measure of our government can gain the enthusiastic support and full force of the people. This is the fundamental reason why our government work has achieved such great achievements in just five years.

At the same time, our national leading organs at all levels have implemented extensive and correct criticism and self-criticism, especially advocating the people's criticism and supervision from the bottom up; they have adopted a revolutionary attitude of warmly welcoming and firmly protecting the people's criticism, while firmly fighting against all phenomena that do not welcome criticism, obstruct criticism, and retaliate against critics. This makes the broad masses of the people increasingly see that our government is truly wholeheartedly serving the people, making our work able to advance vigorously and full of vitality in the process of constantly overcoming our own shortcomings and errors. Taking the Hebei region as an example, it can also be seen that due to the influence of the old society and insufficient education work, phenomena such as bureaucracy and subjectivism exist to varying degrees in the leading organs at all levels, some of which are quite serious, and even a few bad elements have infiltrated our leading organs at all levels to engage in illegal and disorderly activities, seriously harming the interests of the state and the people. For these phenomena, we have, under the inspection and supervision of higher-level governments and the criticism and supervision of the people, continuously fought against and dealt with them. For example, in 1953, the case of Jia Xianmin, the former county magistrate of Wuan County, who committed illegal and disorderly acts of forcing marriage, was handled, and Jia was removed from office and dealt with according to law, which is an example. Such handling has had a good influence among the people. But this does not mean that our criticism and self-criticism have been sufficient. There are still many shortcomings and errors in our work, and there is a lack of constant and effective measures to overcome the bureaucratic style of government work; at the same time, the strict inspection of our work by higher-level leading organs has been very helpful to us, but this inspection has also been very insufficient and infrequent in the past. In addition, we also feel that some departments of the central government, due to insufficient understanding of the specific situation of various places, still have the shortcomings of generalization in guiding the work of various places. To continuously improve our work, I believe that in the leadership of government work, we should continue to carry out the struggle against bureaucracy to further strengthen the connection with the masses of the people and consolidate people's democratic dictatorship, and guarantee the smooth progress of socialist construction and socialist transformation.

Our conference has formulated the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, our country is advancing towards the great goal of socialism. As a people's representative, I deeply feel the honor and great responsibility; at the same time, I also firmly believe that as long as we love the people, trust the people, and are loyal to the people, the people will definitely continue to trust us, help us, and supervise us to do a good job. Precisely because of this, I have full confidence to take on this responsibility and honestly be a servant of the people, which is my wish.

Liang Xi's Speech:

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully support Premier Zhou En-lai's government work report.

In Premier Zhou's report, he pointed out the great achievements of our country's economic construction and also criticized the shortcomings. I thought of the shortcomings in forestry work over the past five years. Now I will briefly introduce the situation of forestry development and hope that all representatives will criticize and guide me.

The Common Program stipulates: "Protect forests and develop forestry in a planned way."

Over the past five years, with the development of economic construction, forestry work has also achieved initial results. In terms of forest protection, in 1953, the area of forest fires nationwide was reduced by 74% compared to 1950, and forest protection has become a habit of the people in many places. In terms of afforestation, a scale of afforestation unprecedented in our country's history and a scale of afforestation have been formed. In 1950, 120,000 hectares were afforested (1 hectare equals 15 mu), and in 1953, it developed to 1,110,000 hectares nationwide, which is twice the area afforested in the 22 years of the reactionary Kuomintang government. Among these afforestations, there are shelterbelts covering a range of more than 1,100 kilometers long and 200-300 kilometers wide in the western part of Northeast China and the eastern part of Inner Mongolia; there are anti-sand afforestations from Donggou to Dingbian in northern Shaanxi; and there are anti-sand afforestations that have basically completed the entire plan in western Hebei and eastern Henan. In the areas where shelterbelts have been planted, the expansion of cultivated land and the increase in crop yields have been significantly seen. For example, in Tucheng Township near Kaifeng, Henan, wheat was not planted in the past, but after afforestation, 710 mu of wheat was planted in 1951, with a yield of 46 jin per mu, and in 1953, it expanded to 3,200 mu, with a yield of 110 jin per mu. In terms of forest survey and design, a reasonable management plan has been made for 2,260,000 hectares of forest in Changbai Mountain; aerial surveying and aerial investigation are being carried out in the sky above the 20 million hectares of forest in the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains.

Title: Forestry Industry Developments and Future Plans

The forestry industry has developed into a substantial production enterprise. Nationwide, there are fifty-one forestry bureaus, sixty-seven wood processing plants, chemical plants for forest products, and affiliated enterprises, over two thousand kilometers of forest railways, and more than three hundred thousand employees. Over the past five years, the industry has ensured the supply of timber needed for national construction. Northeast China and Inner Mongolia are the main timber supply bases in China. After liberation, with the help of Soviet experts, production reforms were implemented, base-level enterprise management institutions were strengthened, work plans and dispatching systems were established, and mechanization was promoted, thereby increasing labor productivity. During the puppet Manchukuo regime, producing ten thousand cubic meters of timber required 888 workers. By 1953, this number had been reduced to 131 workers. The material and cultural lives of employees have also improved significantly compared to the past. Many major forest areas have established primary schools, hospitals, sanatoriums, stores, clubs, and even a nursing home in the Daling Forest Area.

However, we must not be complacent. Over the past five years, there have been many shortcomings. In summary, the following points are noted:

1. Insufficient implementation of the mass line. In 1953, the area of cooperative afforestation reached 50% of the total afforestation area, which is indeed good. However, in some places, the entire village or town was forced to participate, violating the principles of voluntarism and mutual benefit. Forest closure for conservation is indeed the most economical and effective method for eliminating barren mountains and conserving soil. Nationwide, 4.87 million hectares have been closed. However, many of these closures involved coercive orders and did not consider grazing and firewood collection, leading to dissatisfaction among some people. In forest protection and fire prevention, some places have strictly prohibited people from entering the mountains without conditions, neglecting auxiliary industries such as hunting, medicinal herb collection, and reed harvesting. In the construction of protective forests, some places have not adequately educated the masses or planned properly, also causing dissatisfaction among some farmers.

2. Lack of planning. In the basic construction of the forestry industry, there has been insufficient investigation and surveying. Comprehensive planning and overall design have not been conducted, resulting in many construction plans with significant blind spots. Engineering projects have also changed too frequently. In the production of raw logs, there is often excessive production of general timber species while failing to meet the quotas for pit props and sleepers; or the specifications and quality of products do not meet the planned standards. In afforestation, many regions have not had a comprehensive plan for what tree species to plant, what type of forest to create, and where to plant.

3. Low management level. For the entire forest, except for Changbai Mountain, there has been no precise survey of state-owned forests in the past, and there is no complete management plan. Therefore, regeneration (reforestation in areas that have been logged) cannot keep up with logging. Over the past five years, it is estimated that there are over one million hectares of logged areas nationwide, while regeneration has only covered 170,000 hectares. If logging continues at this rate, coupled with losses from fires and pests, China's forests will continue to decrease, which is very dangerous. In the forestry industry, there are also issues such as lax labor discipline, chaotic financial expenditures, exceeding the number of appointed personnel, and relatively severe accidents.

These shortcomings must be corrected in our future work. To "develop forestry in a planned manner," based on the general task of the transitional period of the state, we plan to take the following measures over the next few years:

1. Implement scientific management of state-owned forests. That is, through thorough investigation, surveying, and design, calculate the timber stock, and formulate plans for forest protection, tending, logging, and regeneration.

2. Establish timber forests. Starting this year, large-scale afforestation will be carried out in the south, gradually reaching one million hectares per year, estimated to produce one billion cubic meters of timber annually after thirty years.

3. Establish water source and protective forests. In the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River, Huai River, and Yongding River, as well as other river systems, water source forests will be planned and started. For the desert protection forests in the northwest, a comprehensive plan will be developed; for the protective forests in western Northeast China and eastern Inner Mongolia, it is planned to complete them within ten years.

4. Develop new forest areas. To increase timber production, the southern slopes of the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains and the White Dragon River forest area in the northwest will be developed during the first Five-Year Plan, and preparations will be made for the development of Changbai Mountain and the northern slopes of the Greater Khingan Mountains during the second Five-Year Plan.

5. Divide economic zones. We suggest that, based on the economic conditions and production habits of the people in various regions, the areas suitable for agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry be generally divided, so that agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry can develop in a balanced manner without conflicts.

In summary, to ensure the supply of industrial timber on one hand and to guarantee agricultural water conservation on the other, we will, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, and under the leadership of the Central People's Government, work together with workers in agriculture, animal husbandry, water conservancy, fuel industry, and scientists in botany, entomology, soil, and other fields, as well as the broad masses of the people, to fight against the three million hectares of barren mountains nationwide; to fight against the one thousand-plus miles of sandstorms in Shaanxi; to fight against the major and minor rivers, especially the Yellow River, which has brought disasters to the Chinese people for three thousand years. We will strive to make the Yellow River flow with clear water and turn barren lands into green mountains!

Yang Weiyi's speech:

Chairman, fellow representatives:

After listening to Premier Zhou's government work report, I feel greatly excited and fully agree with and support it.

Since liberation, the country has made tremendous progress in all aspects. Through land reform and various social reforms, industrial and agricultural production has greatly increased, prices have stabilized, and the old social face has been completely changed. The people's democratic system has become increasingly complete, allowing people to enjoy true democratic happiness. The people of the entire nation have closely united around the people's government, becoming a revolutionary family. The great victories in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and the Geneva Conference have greatly enhanced China's international status and strengthened the world's democratic forces. These great achievements not only prepared the necessary conditions for planned large-scale economic construction but also created a good starting point for building our country into a great socialist society.

I am a researcher in the field of entomology, always wanting to contribute my knowledge to the people. However, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, I was considered useless, and all pest control methods were ineffective, leading to a life of failure and no achievements. After liberation, I felt hopeful and, in 1950, proposed to the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government to focus on using cultivation methods to eliminate the pest disaster. This proposal was adopted, and the "three tillage" movement was launched throughout the province: active autumn tillage, universal winter tillage, early spring tillage, and the removal of rice sheaths and weeds from field edges. Experience has proven that this is the simplest and most effective method for eliminating pest disasters. Over the past four years, agricultural pests in Jiangxi have gradually decreased, and the most harmful pest, the rice stem borer, has been basically eliminated, contributing to agricultural increases. I am very happy to have made a contribution to the broad masses of the people. This fact can illustrate the people's government's attention to people's production, life, and science. In this progressive era, scientific workers can contribute their strength, exhibit their initiative, and do something for the state and the people. As long as there is a good idea in science, the people's government will not refuse to adopt it. I will strive with all my might for the great cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation.

Additionally, I have two immature opinions to propose for reference by relevant departments:

1. Last year, the unified purchase of surplus grain in Jiangxi was indeed a good thing. However, due to some cadres' lack of thorough investigation in their work, some farmers' necessary food grains were also forced to be sold as surplus. This year, farmers had to go far to buy grain. This not only wasted farmers' labor but also hindered production and caused some dissatisfaction among the masses. I hope that this year's unified purchase of surplus grain will not repeat this phenomenon.

2. After the implementation of planned supply of edible oil in rural Jiangxi, farmers felt that the oil supply was too little and had complaints. According to the living habits of the people in Jiangxi, the supply of edible oil seems to need to be increased. Currently, the national production of edible oil still cannot meet the needs of urban and rural areas, so we must vigorously promote the planting of oil crops. This winter, we should seize the opportunity to promote the planting of rapeseed in southern provinces.

These are not very mature opinions. I propose them for reference and welcome criticism.

Shi Liang's speech:

Chairman, fellow representatives:

The convening of the First Session of the First National People's Congress and the adoption of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China are events of great historical significance in the political life of the Chinese people, marking a further step towards the democratization of our country. This is worth our excitement. Therefore, I would like to express my heartfelt respect to all the representatives, especially to our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao! The report on the government's work by Premier Zhou at the conference is fully supported by me. Now, I will briefly report on the judicial work of the past five years to the conference for your guidance.

Over the past five years, judicial work has been closely integrated with the political tasks of the state and the central tasks of each period. During the period of national economic recovery, local people's courts mainly used the organization form of people's tribunals to support various social reform movements aimed at eliminating the remnants of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. In the land reform and suppression of counter-revolutionary movements, the enemy was severely struck, and the revolutionary order was consolidated. Next, in the "Three Antis," "Five Antis," the implementation of the Marriage Law, and the universal election movement, criminal elements were punished, and the people were protected. This, from the perspective of judicial work, promoted and guaranteed the smooth completion of various movements.

With the arrival of the period of national economic construction, the people's judicial organs promptly made protecting state property, ensuring the smooth progress of national economic construction and socialist transformation, and safeguarding people's democratic rights and legal interests their primary tasks. According to statistics from recent years, the people's courts have handled cases that directly sabotage national economic construction and socialist transformation, which can be roughly divided into: sabotage and destruction by counter-revolutionary elements; various illegal acts by unscrupulous capitalists; embezzlement, theft, and major responsibility accidents caused by negligence and dereliction of duty by state organs and enterprise personnel. Among these, the most harmful is counter-revolutionary sabotage, followed by criminal acts by unscrupulous capitalists. Local people's courts have seriously and prudently handled these cases, playing a good role in protecting national economic construction. The handling of counter-revolutionary sabotage cases has greatly increased the political vigilance and labor initiative of the masses. After the notorious speculator Lu Zhimin in Shanghai was severely punished for hoarding a large amount of vegetable oil and seriously disrupting market management, law-abiding industrial and commercial households said: "This is completely necessary, only in this way can the boundary between law-abiding and law-breaking be clearly defined." The punishment of embezzlement, theft, and dereliction of duty by state organs and enterprise personnel has protected state property and played an important role in reforming social customs. The punishment of criminal offenders in industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises who caused major responsibility accidents due to negligence and dereliction of duty has been welcomed by the masses of workers, strengthened labor discipline, improved the responsibility system, and increased production efficiency. To deepen judicial work in industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises, in addition to strengthening the trial of cases that sabotage national economic construction, we have also established special courts along the railways and water transport routes. To implement legal supervision on public-private economic contracts, reduce illegal contract behaviors, and many urban people's courts have started public notary work. In rural areas, county people's courts mainly use mobile courts to actively guarantee the smooth progress of agricultural production and mutual aid and cooperation movements.

The people's courts have always made protecting citizens' democratic rights and legal interests their regular task. Due to the people's judicial organs' resolute struggle against criminals who infringe on citizens' lives, bodies, and property, and due to the superiority of our people's democratic system itself, cases of infringing on citizens' rights have been decreasing. For example, the number of robbery cases in 1953 was 95.1% lower than in 1950. The prestige of the people's courts among the people has been increasing, and when people have disputes that cannot be resolved, they naturally seek help from their own courts. This is in stark contrast to the situation under the reactionary courts of the Kuomintang, where "the court faces south, and without money, you cannot enter" and "people die without reporting to the court."

In handling the large number of cases mentioned above, the vast majority have been correctly handled. However, due to the number of cases exceeding the subjective bearing capacity of the people's courts, there have been cases of backlog, and some people's courts have also had cases of light or heavy sentences and wrong judgments. Various people's courts, based on the spirit of being responsible to the people, have been continuously clearing up backlogged cases and seriously checking and correcting wrong cases. Currently, efforts are being made to further strengthen judicial construction to reduce and prevent the occurrence of backlogged and wrongly judged cases.

People's courts are one of the weapons of people's democratic dictatorship. We cannot simply take over the old reactionary court system and use it as is; we must thoroughly smash it and carry out ideological reform on the old judicial personnel. At the beginning of liberation, some cadres did not clearly understand this, so after taking over the mess left by the reactionary courts of the Kuomintang, some people's courts once had serious impure phenomena in politics, organization, and ideology. Therefore, various levels of people's courts launched a judicial reform movement to oppose old legal views, old bureaucratic styles, and to rectify organizations. This effectively struck down the remaining old legal views and old bureaucratic styles, sharply criticized the reactionary and erroneous views of "law is super-class and super-political" and "trial work is purely technical work," and basically drew a clear ideological line between new and old laws in the minds of cadres, and initially established a Marxist-Leninist state view and legal view. At the same time, organizational rectification was carried out, and a small number of counter-revolutionary elements and corrupt officials who had infiltrated the people's courts were punished according to the law; those unsuitable for being people's judicial workers were given other work and life paths; those who had made progress after ideological reform were continued to be used. Meanwhile, various levels of people's courts supplemented a batch of cadres who were loyal to the state and the people, thereby basically changing the serious phenomenon of organizational impurity in the past. It should be noted that progressive individuals who had participated in revolutionary struggles and democratic movements in the old courts were never treated as old judicial personnel. It should also be noted that over the past five years, they have all made some progress in their work.

Based on judicial reform, to further facilitate people's litigation and dispute resolution, various people's courts have gradually established mobile courts, people's reception rooms, people's mediation committees, and some people's courts have also tried the people's jury system. These organizational constructions have been welcomed and praised by the masses of the people, and in the future, they should be further improved to better serve the people.

Although the people's judicial work over the past five years has achieved results, there are still many shortcomings. The main issue is that the thought of "judicial work must serve economic construction" has not been universally and firmly established among all judicial cadres. Some emphasize the lack of cadres and experience, and do not actively serve economic construction; some have a complacent attitude and ignore various sabotage activities in economic construction, thinking "there is no problem," and abandon their responsibilities. Some judicial cadres do not pay enough attention to the democratic construction of people's courts, and some individual cadres even do not respect the democratic rights of the parties involved.

It should be pointed out that the existence of the above shortcomings and errors is not separable from the bureaucracy in our leadership. Due to our lack of serious inspection of work, we have not been able to timely discover and properly solve the key problems existing in various people's courts. We deeply feel that the current judicial construction still cannot meet the needs of the state and the people, but we believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the National People's Congress, and local people's congresses at various levels, these shortcomings and errors can be overcome. In the future, we must strictly implement the provisions of the Constitution and the People's Court Organization Law and other laws, strengthen people's judicial construction, further consolidate people's democratic dictatorship, and guarantee the smooth progress of national socialist construction and socialist transformation, and guarantee that citizens' democratic rights are not infringed upon.

Chen Bo Ren's speech:

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou's government work report. Over the past five years, the Central People's Government and local people's governments have achieved extremely brilliant results in many areas of work, continuously pushing forward the great cause of people's revolution and national construction. The achievements of these five years have surpassed any period in Chinese history by an unknown margin.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people, after more than thirty years of arduous struggle, finally overthrew the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, established the People's Republic of China, eliminated the remaining armed forces of the Chiang Kai-shek gang on the Chinese mainland, and stabilized social order. They carried out a series of movements, including the great victory in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the "Three Antis," the "Five Antis," and the ideological reform of intellectuals. This not only fundamentally consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship, raised the patriotic and socialist consciousness of all the people, but also greatly eliminated the poison of the old society that had long been lingering in people's thoughts and practices. On this basis, we were able to quickly restore the national economy that had been long destroyed by the reactionary government of the Kuomintang and imperialism, develop production, stabilize prices, and correspondingly carry out cultural and educational construction work. Starting from 1953, we began the first Five-Year Plan for economic construction. Gradually, we will realize the socialist industrialization and socialist transformation of the country. In this great historical period of the country's transition to socialism, it has become the common task of the people of the entire nation to strive for.

It should be particularly pointed out that under the wise leadership of the Central People's Government and the Communist Party, every major measure taken over the past five years has been unprecedented and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. The three major movements need not be mentioned; in the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, it was indeed done with great fanfare and with lightning speed. Even important Communist Party members who made mistakes and committed crimes were also subjected to the punishment of the law and party discipline. At that time, a surrendered general in Xinjiang was very excited about this movement and said: "This time, the Communist Party will definitely be eternal." This was not accidental.

In international affairs, over the past five years, we have also achieved extremely brilliant results. Our country signed the great Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance with the Soviet Union; our country participated in the Geneva Conference; the Prime Ministers of China and India, and China and Burma, issued joint statements, proposing the Five Principles of Mutual Respect for Territorial Integrity and Sovereignty, Mutual Non-Aggression, Non-Interference in Internal Affairs, Equality and Mutual Benefit, and Peaceful Coexistence. We have united more international friends, strengthened the peace and democratic forces led by the Soviet Union, and greatly enhanced our country's international prestige. Without the participation of the People's Republic of China, it is impossible to achieve a reasonable solution to major world events, especially Asian events. These great victories have ended the humiliating diplomacy of our history for a hundred years, actively entered the international political arena, and obtained the position that our country should have among the major powers in the world. All the people of the various ethnic groups in our country sincerely appreciate the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, and appreciate the delegation headed by Premier Zhou that attended the Geneva Conference.

However, it must be admitted that there are still many shortcomings and errors in our production, work, and study. Our criticism and self-criticism have not been sufficiently carried out, especially the criticism from the bottom up, which is even more difficult to carry out. There are those who suppress and attack criticism, those who cover up the truth and try to escape criticism in every possible way, those who consider personal interests and dare not criticize, and those who are too worldly and keep silent about bad people and bad deeds and do not want to criticize. In summary, these are all the tricks of bourgeois individualism, and are not manifestations of loving the motherland and loving the cause of justice. We should advocate honest and bold criticism, requiring any criticized person to be humble and tolerant; any criticizer should also follow the ancient teaching of "treating the disease to save the person" and "loving people with virtue" to criticize seriously and responsibly for the sake of the country's interests and the protection of the people's interests. We should continuously consolidate achievements, correct shortcomings, and gradually build our country into a great socialist society.

This fully proves that what Chairman Mao said is true: "Our cause is just. A just cause is invincible."

I believe that with the correct leadership of the great Communist Party of China headed by Chairman Mao, our criticism can be carried out, and our work can be done better; we have a strong People's Liberation Army and People's Volunteer Army, a broad united front of the people's democracy, unity among all ethnic groups in the country, and deep friendship with the great Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries and all peace-loving people in the world. The success of our cause is well-guaranteed, as long as we unite even better, we have the confidence to smash any invasion plot of American imperialism.

As a people's representative, I promise to work actively and, together with the people of the entire nation, strive for the liberation of Taiwan and the complete annihilation of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. As a people's representative, I promise to work actively and, together with the people of the entire nation, strive to build a prosperous and happy socialist society.

Xu Jiexin's speech:

Chairman, fellow representatives:

Premier Zhou's government work report summarizes the great achievements of our country's construction and points out the direction for future work, which I fully support.

The capitalist industry and commerce in our country are an important economic factor. In a certain period, it has a positive role in promoting the national economy and people's livelihood, but it also has a negative role. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the people's government, in accordance with the provisions of the Common Program, has adopted a policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce. This means utilizing the positive role of capitalist industry and commerce in promoting the national economy and people's livelihood, restricting its negative role, and gradually transforming it through socialist transformation. The ultimate goal of implementing socialist transformation on capitalist industry and commerce is to replace private ownership with public ownership. Based on the historical conditions and actual conditions of our country, we may gradually realize this transformation through various forms of state capitalism. The first step is to encourage and guide capitalist industry and commerce to transform into various forms of state capitalist economy; the second step is to transform the state capitalist economy into a socialist economy.

State capitalism is the direct leadership of the socialist economy over the connection and cooperation between socialist and capitalist elements in the economy. After capitalist enterprises transform into state capitalist enterprises, they are, to varying degrees, incorporated into the national planning track, restricting the anarchic production of capitalism and the destructive activities of capitalists seeking profit; at the same time, under the conditions of state capitalism, the labor of the working masses can gradually become mainly for the state, with only a small part for the profit of capitalists, so their labor enthusiasm and labor productivity are improved, and the labor-capital relationship within the enterprise can be properly handled. These changes are not only beneficial to restricting the negative role of capitalist industry and commerce but also enable the state to fully utilize its positive role—assisting the state in developing production, accumulating funds, supplying residents' needs, maintaining employment, and training enterprise technical and management personnel. Experience has proven that gradually completing the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce through various forms of state capitalism is a relatively sound policy and method.

After several years of transformation, the main part of capitalist industry has now transformed into various forms of state capitalist enterprises. The trend of capitalist industry transforming into state capitalism is: from low-level forms to mid-level and high-level forms; from main industries to secondary industries; from large cities to medium and small cities. In recent years, state capitalist industry, whether in absolute value or in the proportion of the national economy, has been increasing year by year. The output value of joint-venture industry in 1953 was nine times that of 1949; the proportion of joint-venture industry in the national industrial output value increased from 2% in 1949 to 6% in 1953. Other forms of state capitalism, especially mid-level forms, have also developed greatly. According to statistics from twelve large and medium-sized cities such as Shanghai and Tianjin, the output value of processing, ordering, etc., if 1950 is taken as 100, then in 1953 it rose to 364. The low-level form of state capitalism is gradually developing into the mid-level form. Taking the twelve large and medium-sized cities of Shanghai and Tianjin as an example, if the low-level form of procurement and the mid-level form of processing and ordering are added together as 100, then in 1950, the low-level form of procurement accounted for 19.4%, and in 1953 it had dropped to 9%; in the same period, the mid-level form of processing, ordering, and consignment increased from 80.6% to 91%.

In the commercial sector, although there was no significant development during the period of economic recovery, after the start of large-scale national economic construction, the situation changed dramatically. Because the growth rate of residents' purchasing power far exceeded the growth rate of daily consumer goods production, many commodities appeared to be in short supply in the market, and the existence of free markets and the speculation of speculators further increased the supply tension of some commodities. To stabilize the market and ensure supply, it is necessary to gradually change the unorganized free market into an organized market. Therefore, the state has expanded the scope of processing, ordering, and consignment of industrial products, and in the winter of 1953, implemented the planned purchase and supply of grain and oil. Recently, the planned purchase and supply of cotton and cotton cloth have also been implemented. Under the conditions of planned purchase and supply, the law of commodity circulation and market relations have undergone fundamental changes, and the connection between private commerce and capitalist industry and the spontaneous forces of capitalist agriculture has been greatly restricted. In industries where the state unifies the control of goods, especially in industries where planned purchase and sale are implemented, private retail merchants are generally incorporated into the track of state capitalism. Currently, agency sales and consignment sales are relatively developed forms of state capitalism in commerce. After the planned purchase and supply of grain and edible oil, grain and edible oil merchants have respectively changed into agency stores and consignment stores of state-owned commerce; after the planned purchase and supply of cotton cloth, cotton cloth retail merchants have generally established consignment or agency relationships with state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives. In addition, in some other industries, forms such as batch purchasing, retailing, public-private joint purchasing, and public-private joint operations have also been developed.

The socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is an important part of the general task of the transitional period of the state. To do a good job in this aspect, we need to pay further attention to the following issues:

1. The transformation of capitalist industry will mainly be carried out through the high-level form of state capitalism—joint ventures. Joint ventures are the cooperation between socialist and capitalist elements within the enterprise, with the socialist element taking the lead. This situation not only facilitates the transformation of the original enterprise according to the management principles and management principles of socialist enterprises but also helps in the education and transformation of capitalist elements. The "Provisional Regulations on Joint-Venture Industrial Enterprises" recently issued by the State Council is formulated based on the requirements of the general line of the state in the transitional period and the experience of joint-venture enterprises over the past few years. We must carry out education and propaganda on this regulation among the cadres and industrial capitalists of joint-venture enterprises, educate our cadres to do a good job in joint-venture enterprises, correct the "rightist" or "leftist" tendencies of some cadres due to their unclear understanding of the nature of joint-venture enterprises, and neglecting the legal rights of private capital; at the same time, further encourage and guide capitalist industries that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood to gradually transform into joint-venture industries.

2. Chinese capitalist industry grew up under colonial and semi-colonial conditions. Due to these historical conditions and the blind nature of capitalist production, there are many irrational phenomena in management and operation, in the distribution of industries and regions. For example, equipment is scattered and backward, organizations are bloated, management is corrupt and incompetent, product specifications do not meet objective needs, production areas are far from sales areas, raw materials are far from factories, etc., all of which are evidence. These irrational situations hinder the smooth progress of socialist transformation. We should encourage private industry to rectify these aspects as much as possible and, on a voluntary basis, appropriately carry out joint operations and mergers to reduce scattered and backward situations, and make some preparations for the smooth progress of socialist transformation work.

3. Under the condition that the state unifies the control of certain commodities, the transformation of private commerce will generally be carried out industry by industry. For these industries that are being transformed, appropriate measures will be taken for both wholesale merchants and retail merchants. For wholesale merchants, if they can continue to operate, they will be allowed to continue; if state-owned commerce needs them to act as agents for wholesale business, they can be entrusted to act as agents; if they can be converted to retail, they will be allowed to convert to retail; if they can be converted to other industries, they will be guided to convert. Wholesale merchants who cannot be placed through the above methods, including real business personnel, will be trained and, under the principle of being subject to dispatch and following the wage system of state-owned commerce, can be placed in state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce. For retail merchants, as long as they are patriotic and law-abiding and comply with the regulations of state-owned commerce, the state will, according to different types of commodities and business methods, adopt various forms to incorporate them into the track of state capitalism. In commerce, the transformation of the entire industry into state capitalism is only the beginning of the transformation work; how to improve their management and operation, how to divide the supply network, how to adjust the excessive number of stores in a certain industry, how to supervise and educate these commercial capitalists and small business owners, overcome their illegal acts, and systematically carry out ideological transformation, are all very arduous tasks. Therefore, if it is thought that the problem is solved after the entire industry is transformed into state capitalism, it is wrong. Only by correcting this erroneous view can we do a good job in the transformation of private merchants.

4. The implementation of socialist transformation on capitalist enterprises is a special form of class struggle in the transitional period. The process of developing state capitalism fully demonstrates the complexity and sharpness of the struggle. In joint-venture enterprises, some capitalists had hidden enemy and puppet property, engaged in passive resistance, and some even used joint ventures to "jointly operate privately." In processing and ordering, the general practice of capitalists is to require the state to do more processing and ordering when the enterprise is in difficulty; when the market is good and profits are high, they try to get rid of the state's processing and ordering. Some capitalists even use the state's processing and ordering to engage in shoddy work, embezzle raw materials, steal state property, and other illegal activities to achieve the purpose of making huge profits. In the consignment and agency of commerce, illegal activities such as adulteration, short weight, price gouging, price cutting, stealing state property, and embezzling state funds are also quite serious. For these acts of resistance and sabotage of socialist transformation, serious criticism and struggle are needed. Due to the superiority of state capitalism over capitalism becoming increasingly apparent, and due to the propaganda and education of the general task of the transitional period, the number of industrial and commercial workers who are patriotic, law-abiding, and actively accepting socialist transformation, and who have taken the lead and played a bridging role, has been increasing. However, there are still many capitalists who take a passive attitude, among whom some are still engaged in resistance and sabotage, and continue to engage in passive resistance, withdraw funds, and turn production materials into living materials. Some are engaged in inciting workers against the government, destroying production equipment, and even committing murder. We need to explain to industrial and commercial workers extensively and deeply the reason why capitalist industry and commerce must undergo socialist transformation, explain the specific policies of the people's government for transforming capitalist industry and commerce, and raise their enthusiasm for accepting socialist transformation; while for those who engage in illegal activities and resistance, they should be criticized and educated according to different natures and degrees, and appropriately dealt with; for those with serious offenses, they should be punished according to the law.

5. The transformation of capitalist enterprises should be combined with the transformation of capitalist elements. Only in this way can our socialist transformation cause the work of further transforming state capitalist economy into socialist economy to proceed smoothly. This aspect of work has shortcomings. In state capitalist enterprises, although attention has been paid to improving and increasing production, the work of educating and transforming capitalist elements is often not paid enough attention to and is even neglected. In the political and ideological education of capitalist elements, many places often only pay attention to various political movements and social reforms in each period, and do not link them to their practice in production and enterprise reform, so that the gains they make in learning can be consolidated in practice. In the future, in state capitalist enterprises, the transformation of enterprises should be closely combined with the education and transformation of capitalists and their agents, helping them to gradually learn new things and new ideas, so that they can play a positive role in the cause of socialist transformation.

The socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is a complex and arduous task. There are undoubtedly many difficulties on the way forward, but the objective conditions are favorable. As long as we continuously improve our political awareness, implement the state's policies, and maintain a cautious and serious attitude of learning, we will definitely be able to promote the cause of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce!

Huang Zhengqing's speech:

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou's government work report.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, we have achieved great results in all areas of work over the past five years. In our Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Region, we have implemented regional autonomy, strengthened unity among ethnic groups and within ethnic groups, supported and cooperated with the People's Liberation Army to eliminate the bandit forces directly supported by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and stabilized social order. We have developed agricultural and pastoral production, trade, transportation, medical care, and other undertakings, and people's lives have improved somewhat. However, there are still many shortcomings in our work. First, we have not fully utilized the functions of the autonomous organs, and in managing ethnic affairs, the initiative of being the master of the house is not enough, and some phenomena of disunity within ethnic groups have not been timely eliminated. There are still few ethnic cadres who actively propose improvement measures in their work. Second, the autonomous region's people's government and higher authorities have not conducted enough investigations and research on ethnic characteristics, making some work plans and specific measures of the autonomous region not practical enough, and lacking some single-line regulations suitable for the needs of the ethnic group. We also feel that in some matters, the higher authorities' help and guidance for the work of the Gannan region are not timely and specific enough, and in helping the autonomous organs to play their role, there are also some areas that are not done well enough. In the future, in addition to striving to correct the above shortcomings and suggesting that relevant higher authorities improve leadership, we should continue to strengthen ethnic unity, increase vigilance, and at any time combat any sabotage plots from the enemy, and prevent possible disputes between ethnic groups and within ethnic groups. We believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, the people of all ethnic groups in our country will definitely be able to unite as one, follow the provisions of the Constitution, and achieve the great cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation.

Sheng Pihua's speech:

Chairman, fellow representatives:

After listening to Premier Zhou's report, I deeply feel that since the founding of the People's Republic of China, our country's achievements are enormous, and the progress is astonishing! Our country is so vast, with such a large population and such complex situations, that in just five years, we have accomplished what could not be done in the past few decades or even hundreds of years. This is a miracle in our country's history. No wonder our enemies are jealous and sad.

Why could such a miracle be created in such a short period? This is very clear. The main reason is that we have the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China, the vanguard party of the working class, and established a superior people's democratic system. Therefore, as Liu Shaoqi said in his report on the draft Constitution: "Once the power of the state is in the hands of the organized and led people, it can exert an invincible force."

The great achievements pointed out by Premier Zhou in the report over the past five years are also very obvious in Shanghai. Everyone knows: Shanghai was long occupied and ruled by imperialism and bureaucratic compradors, and was the base for them to operate, monopolize, and plunder the wealth of the Chinese people. It was once the most rampant place for hooligans and the most corrupt place in social customs. However, after Shanghai's liberation in 1949, although it was under the blockade and harassment of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the people's government, the protection of the People's Liberation Army, and the united efforts of the people of the entire city, we have been working hard on recovery and construction in various aspects such as economy, culture, and urban administration, and have achieved great results, established a new social order, and continuously increased production and improved living standards. Today's Shanghai has undergone fundamental changes and has become an important industrial production city serving national construction and people's livelihood. Of course, we cannot be complacent with the achievements we have made. We still have many shortcomings that need to be corrected in time. For example, the Shanghai People's Court has worked diligently and tirelessly over the years to carry out trial work, which is indeed commendable, protecting the people's democratic system and maintaining public order; however, there are many backlogged cases that have not been tried quickly, and even after last year's special cleanup, they still cannot be resolved, and some cases have been delayed for one or two years without being tried. This will affect the relationship between the government and the masses. Again, some individual judicial workers have not judged different citizens according to the principle of equality before the law, and these should be corrected in the future.

For private industrial and commercial workers in our country, it is necessary to accept socialist transformation, and first of all, they must be patriotic and law-abiding. Most private industrial and commercial workers have received education over the past few years and are willing to be genuine law-abiding citizens, but there are still some problems in taxation, and some industrial and commercial workers have deliberately evaded taxes, which must be criticized and educated, and seriously dealt with to maintain law and order and ensure taxation. At the same time, many industrial and commercial workers have not seriously studied tax laws, actively improved management systems, and conducted regular inspections, so the tax payment rate is still quite large. In the future, we should pay attention to taxation in our minds and act according to the law. But on the other hand, our country's tax laws are still quite complex, difficult to interpret, and often inconsistent, and the accounting standards are not uniform. If tax laws can be made simple and clear, interpretations can be unified, accounting standards can be unified, and propaganda and education can be strengthened, it will definitely be beneficial for the genuine implementation of tax laws and the transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises.

Now our country's Constitution has been adopted, and we will definitely, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, work hard, diligently, and mutually encourage each other, avoid any boasting and arrogance, implement the Constitution, and ensure the victory of socialist construction and socialist transformation.

Shao Shiping's speech:

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou's report and will definitely implement the tasks proposed in the report in my future work.

Over the past five years, the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao have led the people of the entire nation to accomplish tremendous work, implementing the Common Program, and in all aspects such as domestic affairs, diplomacy, military affairs, politics, economy, and culture, we have achieved historic great achievements and victories. These achievements and victories vividly demonstrate the superiority of our country's people's democratic system. These achievements and victories have inspired the people of the entire nation, bringing them the firm will and confidence to transition to socialism. These achievements and victories have also inspired the people of the world, adding strength to the world's peace and democratic camp. As Liu Shaoqi said in his report on the draft Constitution: "Our country has already, together with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, become a stronghold for defending world peace."

Jiangxi is one of the revolutionary base areas. After the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao led the Red Army to go north to resist Japan, the people of this revolutionary base area suffered destructive ravages from the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang bandits, with the economy severely damaged, production greatly reduced, and the population greatly reduced. Since liberation, the people of Jiangxi have been joyful and enthusiastic. Under the wise and correct leadership and loving care of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, we have successfully carried out large-scale struggles such as land reform, resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and restoring the national economy, and since 1953, we have been successfully carrying out planned economic construction on the basis of the recovery of the national economy. The material and cultural lives of the broad masses of the people have also been correspondingly improved. This has fundamentally changed the social foundation of Jiangxi, creating a good starting point for socialist construction and socialist transformation.

Over the past five years, the work in Jiangxi Province has indeed achieved great results, but at the same time, there are also many shortcomings and some errors in the work. For example, the planned purchase and supply of grain is an important measure to implement the general task of the state in the transitional period and is completely correct. In the work of planned grain purchase, we have also striven to complete the task and even exceeded it. However, in many places, due to improper control, the grain purchase area was too wide. Although there were still some rich peasants and some well-off peasants influenced by rich peasants whose surplus grain was not completely purchased, at the same time, many basic peasant masses, village cadres, labor models, and activists not only sold their surplus grain but also sold part of their food grain. In the work of planned grain supply, although the supply was guaranteed, the grain supply area also had to be made wider. This led to a phenomenon of buying and selling grain, transporting it back and forth. This wasted some of the farmers' labor, affected agricultural production, and increased some unnecessary difficulties in grain work. In the collection and supply of oil and edible oil, there were also some tense situations in many places. This is a problem related to the daily life of the broad masses, and we must solve it appropriately, otherwise, it will affect the production of grain and oil and may also affect the needs of the state.

This year is the second year of our country's first Five-Year Plan. The people of the entire province of Jiangxi, under the encouragement of the general task of the state in the transitional period, are in high spirits, and industrial and agricultural production is generally going smoothly. However, since the summer, some areas have suffered severe floods, causing heavy losses. To make up for the losses caused by this flood, the First Session of the First Provincial People's Congress of Jiangxi Province specially passed the "Resolution on Launching the Production and Disaster Relief Movement." Now the people of the entire province are working with all their might to implement this movement to strive for the completion of the 1954 industrial and agricultural production plan and various tasks.

"Carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory." Chairman Mao's great call to the revolutionary base areas, the people of Jiangxi always remember it. We will further carry forward the revolutionary tradition, resolutely abide by and implement the Constitution, various laws, and all resolutions of the First Session of the First National People's Congress. We will work hard in all aspects to strengthen work, increase vigilance, strengthen defense, and with sufficient manpower, material resources, and financial resources, actively support the People's Liberation Army to liberate Taiwan and annihilate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. We will, with high enthusiasm and creativity, strive for the gradual realization of the socialist industrialization of the state, the gradual completion of the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, and the construction of a prosperous and happy socialist society.

Hua Luogeng's speech:

Chairman, fellow representatives:

In the midst of the joyous celebration of the adoption of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, we have also heard Premier Zhou's richly contented government work report, and we feel extremely excited. We are fortunate to represent the people of the entire nation in the First Session of the First National People's Congress to listen to and discuss the government work report, which includes so many glorious achievements. We sincerely thank the hardworking and wise government leaders. I propose that the conference adopt Premier Zhou's government work report.

The achievements mentioned by Premier Zhou in the report, such as resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, the Geneva Conference, and other struggles for peace, economic construction, and social reform, we are all completely satisfied with. This series of achievements has already made our country's international status rise rapidly, the people's power increasingly consolidated, and the people's material and cultural lives significantly improved. This is something that every Chinese person can personally feel. Especially the liberation of Taiwan is the unanimous wish and demand of the entire nation. We will wholeheartedly support the government and strive for the liberation of Taiwan, and we will not stop until the goal is achieved.

In discussing the Constitution, many representatives quoted Article 95 to illustrate the people's democratic government's concern for science, literature, and art. As a scientific worker, I naturally have a deep feeling about this. Especially when I recall the fact that my works could not be published during the reactionary rule, this feeling is even more intimate.

However, I must say that over the past five years, our achievements are far from being able to keep up with the rapid development of our motherland. Especially in scientific work, it is still far from being able to support the needs of production and construction. How to catch up urgently is the responsibility of every scientific and cultural worker.

Lenin once said: "Only when one enriches one's mind with all the treasures of knowledge created by humanity, can one become a communist." If we use this profound truth to measure our work, we will find that our work still has serious shortcomings. There is a thought of not starting from hard work, diligent study, and strict training, not starting from accepting and integrating the treasures of human knowledge, but wanting to create amazing achievements by relying on intelligence, tricks, and luck. Vice Chairman Xi Zhongxun once conveyed the correct policy of the State Council's Cultural and Educational Commission: "Consolidate and strengthen, develop key areas, improve quality, and advance steadily." However, this policy has not been well implemented in our minds.

On the other hand, there is also a situation of being too conservative and "not taking action." The masses have a feeling of poverty in scientific, literary, and artistic work since liberation, and there is also a strong desire for writers and scientists, hoping that they can do more work that matches the progress of the country.

The elimination of these shortcomings is of course the responsibility of every scientific worker and literary and artistic worker. But on the other hand, we also hope that the government will appropriately take care of the time of experts who are more involved in social activities for their professional work, so that we can have time to study, research, and write.

Chairman Mao has repeatedly instructed us: "With the arrival of the high tide of economic construction, it is inevitable that a high tide of cultural construction will follow." Today, from Premier Zhou's report, we can already see and feel the signs of the arrival of the economic high tide. We scientific workers should work together with other comrades engaged in cultural work to redouble our efforts to welcome the arrival of the cultural high tide.

Fu Zuoyi's speech:

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with Premier Zhou's government work report and would like to make a brief speech on the achievements of our country's water conservancy construction over the past five years.

Over the past five years, the construction of various projects in our country has made rapid progress. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government, through the efforts of the people of the entire nation, the construction of water conservancy has also achieved great results.

Due to the long-term destruction during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, after liberation, the people's demand for water conservancy construction in various places was very urgent. However, based on the law of proportionate development of the national economy, some projects also required a relatively long period of preparation in terms of technology, so we could only proceed step by step and with key points, gradually treating the major rivers; for rivers that could not be treated fundamentally, we conducted surveys and designs on the one hand, and improved and consolidated existing projects on the other, or appropriately treated them to strengthen flood control and reduce disasters; at the same time, relying on the enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people, we extensively carried out agricultural water conservancy construction to eliminate local water and drought disasters.

By June of this year, the country has completed 29 billion cubic meters of earthwork, 19 million cubic meters of masonry, and 770,000 cubic meters of concrete work. Completing such a large project in a short period is unprecedented in history.

The Huai River treatment project, which began in the winter of 1950, is carried out in two steps: the first step is to solve the frequent flood and waterlogging disasters, and the second step is to eliminate the extremely rare flood disasters and comprehensively develop water conservancy. The four-year Huai River treatment project is still within the scope of the first step. Currently, in flood control projects, five reservoirs and sixteen lake and depression flood storage projects have been completed, and two more reservoirs are under construction, with three reservoirs still in the survey and design stage. The Sanhe Sluice Gate has been built in Hongze Lake to eliminate the threat of Huai River floods to northern Jiangsu, and the Su North Irrigation Main Canal has been opened from Hongze Lake to the Yellow Sea, laying the foundation for irrigation and navigation in northern Jiangsu, and also serving as an auxiliary flood discharge channel. In addition, the main dikes have been repaired according to different standards, some tributaries have been partially dredged, and drainage projects are being promoted year by year.

The Yellow River and the Yangtze River have not yet been fundamentally treated. Currently, in addition to actively preparing for the fundamental treatment, the quality of the dikes has also been improved. At the same time, in response to the 1933 flood, a flood detention and storage project has been built on the Yellow River; in response to the 1931 flood, a flood diversion project has been built on the Jingjiang section of the middle reaches of the Yangtze River to reduce the threat to the Jingjiang Great Dike.

The Guanting Reservoir has been built on the Yongding River in North China, and the Dapuhe Reservoir has begun to be built on the Hun River, a tributary of the Lia River in Northeast China. In addition, the Chaobai River and Daqing River in North China, the Yishu River and Shuxi River in East China, and the Pearl River Delta in South China have all undergone different degrees of treatment.

Under the conditions of the completion of land reform and the gradual development of agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation, agricultural water conservancy projects have also been widely developed. Over the past five years, the country has expanded the irrigation area by 61 million mu.

The above is a rough outline of China's water conservancy construction over the past five years. These projects that have been built one after another have played a certain role in reducing water and drought disasters, guaranteeing agricultural increases, and national industrial construction over the past few years.

This year, the Yangtze River, Huai River basin, and some parts of North China have experienced extremely heavy rains. The rain in the Yangtze River basin and the floods are the heaviest on record in a hundred years. The rainy season was early, the rainfall was heavy, the rain area was wide, and the duration was long, so the waters of Dongting Lake, Poyang Lake, Han River, and the waters from the Yangtze River all met one after another. The flood was much larger than the largest flood on record. From Yichang to Nanjing, a 1,500-kilometer water level has long exceeded the highest record, and some have even exceeded the top of the dike. The floods in the Huai River basin this year exceeded those of 1931 and 1950. The Yellow River experienced eight floods of 8,000 to 15,000 cubic meters per second for one month in August and September, passing through the Yellow River Railway Bridge on the Beijing-Hankou Railway. Such a long period of high water level is a rare phenomenon in many years. The rainfall in Hebei this year was also very heavy, and the rainy season was very long, so after the rivers converged, the water level of the Xihe River flowing into Tianjin also exceeded the highest water level in 1939.

We all remember that the floods in 1931, which were smaller than this year, resulted in 370,000 people dying of famine, according to the records of Chinese famine relief history. Even according to the figures published by the Relief Commission, 265,000 people in the Jianghuai basin were directly drowned, not to mention those who died of illness and starvation. In the Yangtze River basin, Wuhan City was flooded, and the then capital of the reactionary government of the Kuomintang, Nanjing, was also flooded; in the Huai River basin, the flood rushed down from the Yuzhou Plain, and Bengbu City was flooded, the Tianpu Railway was interrupted, and the dikes of the Su North Canal were also breached in many places, and the Lixiahe area was completely flooded. In 1939, Tianjin was also flooded, with water depths reaching two meters, lasting more than a month. This year's floods were larger than those in 1931 and 1939. If it were not for the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the people's government, and if it were not for Chairman Mao's wise foresight, and the large amount of investment the country made over the past five years to build water conservancy projects, the flood disasters that might have occurred this year would be unimaginable.

In the fight against the extremely heavy floods this year, the organizational strength of the entire country has shown unprecedented excellence. The front line of flood control is like the front line of war, achieving what is needed, having what is needed; party and government cadres and the masses share life and death, and reach the highest level of unity; the development of mutual aid and cooperation in rural areas has greatly strengthened the strength of flood control and disaster relief; at the same time, the flood control projects built over the past five years, combined with the flood control struggle, have also played their due role, effectively avoiding or reducing disasters.

For example, the Jingjiang Great Dike on the Yangtze River is the most dangerous section in the middle reaches. This year, it experienced five dangerous flood peaks, and under the efforts of tens of thousands of flood control personnel and the reasonable use of the Jingjiang flood diversion project, the safety of the dike was successfully guaranteed. Especially on August 7, the water level in Yichang reached 55.73 meters, and it was calculated that when the flood peak reached Shashi, the water level would exceed the top of the Jingjiang Great Dike. After the Jingjiang flood diversion project diverted the flood, the water level in Shashi still exceeded the highest record. If there had been no Jingjiang flood diversion project and other measures, the Jingjiang Great Dike would have been breached, not only causing the death of a large number of people but also making it difficult for Wuhan City to hold out.

In 1931, the highest water level in Wuhan was 28.28 meters, but when the water level reached 26.94 meters, it was breached and flooded, with water depths of several meters on the ground, and the flooding lasted for four months. This year, the water level in Wuhan reached 29.73 meters, exceeding the past highest water level for 58 days. However, under the defense of the people of Wuhan and the People's Liberation Army, the more than 100-kilometer-long dike, after five phases of heightening and strengthening, with the water rising and the dike rising, ensured the safety of Wuhan City.

The tributary of the Yangtze River, the Han River, was flooded on both banks in 1931, and in 1935, it suffered another disaster. This year, due to the backwater effect of the Yangtze River, the water level below Shayan was particularly high, but the safety of the left bank of the Han River was ensured, avoiding the heavy disasters of 1931 and 1935.

In the fight against abnormal floods, the completed projects in the Huai River basin have also played their due role. The four upstream reservoirs all experienced floods of 2,000 to 3,000 cubic meters per second, which were either completely not released or only released a few tens of cubic meters. The nine lake and depression flood storage projects in the middle reaches of the Huai River above Fengtai all stored a large amount of water, playing an important role in reducing the flood peak of the Huai River main stream. Under the efforts of the people of Anhui, the safety of the eastern plain of Anhui north of the Huai River was basically guaranteed, the Tianpu Railway was unobstructed, and Bengbu City and Huainan City were also preserved. The Fuzifeng Reservoir, which has just been completed, had the largest inflow of 5,000 cubic meters per second upstream, and due to the reservoir's detention, only 615 cubic meters per second were released. The flood diversion project of the Huai River main and tributaries below Wuxi prevented the backflow of the Huai River and allowed the internal river floods to be discharged smoothly. The treatment of the Sihe River and Beiyuan River also played a significant role in reducing waterlogging disasters.

In the lower reaches of the Huai River, due to the control of floods in the upper and middle reaches, especially the reasonable operation of the Sanhe Sluice Gate, and the auxiliary flood discharge of the Su North Irrigation Main Canal, although it encountered winds of 5 to 8 levels, under the defense of the people of Su North, the safety of the Lixiahe area was ensured, completely avoiding the tragedy of the breach of the Tianpu Dike in 1931.

The flood control of the Yellow River has not yet ended, and although the water situation this year is very dangerous, no disasters have occurred so far. Tianjin City, under the efforts of Hebei Province, Tianjin City, and the People's Liberation Army, avoided the disaster of 1939. The Duliang River, which was completed last year, diverted half of the flow of the Daqing River and the Ziya River. The closure of the Guanting Reservoir gates, preventing the Yongding River water from flowing down, was also an important factor in the victory.

Water conservancy work is a struggle with nature. In our country, which is vast, has many rivers, and spans the cold, temperate, and tropical zones, it is impossible to completely eliminate water and drought disasters in a short period. Therefore, this year, in Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Henan, Jiangsu, and Hebei, many places still experienced serious waterlogging and flood disasters. In the Yangtze River, Huai River, Han River, and other rivers, when the flood is too large, we have also used the pre-prepared flood diversion areas to actively divert the flood to avoid greater disasters. The spirit of the people in the flood diversion areas, who sacrifice local interests for the overall interests and small benefits for the greater benefits, should be highly respected. This year's floods were larger than those in 1931, but the national disaster situation, if compared with 1931, has greatly reduced the affected area and the degree of disaster. Especially in such a dangerous flood situation, due to the water situation forecast, the people in the possibly affected areas all made preparations or moved in advance, thereby avoiding a large number of deaths, and the affected masses were also properly settled and relieved, and the government immediately allocated sufficient funds to carry out project repairs and production recovery work. We have achieved the above achievements, on the one hand, due to the effectiveness of the water control projects over the past five years, but the most important thing is the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China and the people's government, the timely support of all aspects of the country, especially the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, making the people in the disaster areas all feel that we, as a nation, are fighting against floods as an organized whole, and behind us, there is the Communist Party of China, there are 600 million people of the country, and there is the care of Chairman Mao, who is like the sun; it is not like in the past, being scattered, passive, and helpless. Therefore, everyone can stand firm and fight bravely against the threats of nature, overcoming the damage caused by nature.

After the test of the floods this year, it also exposed many shortcomings in our planning, design, construction, management, and flood control work. For example, some projects adopted a low design flood standard; some buildings were found to have local damage and could not play their due role; some dikes also had unnecessary breaches. In addition to our continued inspection and improvement, we also hope that all representatives will criticize and correct us.

In summary, although the party and government leadership and the people along the rivers have made the greatest efforts in the fight against the extremely heavy floods this year, and most projects have played their due role; however, there are still many places where serious disasters have occurred. As a water conservancy worker, our mood is heavy. Let me express my respect here to the heroic people and the People's Liberation Army who participated in flood control, to the leadership and support of the relevant departments and all cadres, especially to the people in the disaster areas, expressing my deep concern.

Cao Qichao's speech:

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou's report.

Over the past four years, the work in Chongqing City, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government, has undergone a series of social democratic reforms, recovery, and production development, transforming this old and dilapidated mountain city, which was severely destroyed by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, into a more prosperous city, and creating conditions for further transforming it into a socialist city. The changes over the past few years have been tremendous, and the most obvious is that the proportion of industry has increased, and the socialist economy has rapidly grown. Compared to 1950, the total industrial output value in 1953 increased by 1.8 times, with the state-owned industry growing the fastest, increasing from 22.31% to 42.39%; the total business turnover of commerce increased by one time, with the proportion of state-owned and cooperative commerce increasing from 14% to 69.34%. This shows that the socialist economy has indeed become the leading force of the entire national economy. At the same time, capitalist industry and commerce are being incorporated into the track of state capitalism in various forms; handicrafts are heading towards the path of cooperation. This has added more socialist factors to this city in the process of socialist transformation.

With the development of national economic construction, people's education has also developed accordingly, the quality of school teaching has improved, and students' academic performance has been continuously improving. People's material and cultural lives have been continuously improving and adding new content, and people's ideological consciousness has undergone great changes, and a new moral style is forming and has gradually become a social force influencing people's behavior.

These all fully illustrate the correctness of the policies and guidelines set by the central authorities, the timeliness of the guidance, enabling us to successfully change the old and successfully carry out the great socialist construction project. The beautiful vision of socialism is already before our eyes, and we feel exceptionally excited.

However, in the execution of various national tasks, we have many shortcomings. The main issues are: the completion of the national industrial production plan is unbalanced, incomplete, loose at the beginning and tight at the end, and the phenomenon of overtime and overtime work has not been completely overcome; the turnover plan of state-owned commerce and the production plan of the industrial sector have not been well coordinated, resulting in supply and demand imbalance, and the state-owned commerce sector has not sufficiently studied the needs of the people and has not timely grasped the changes in the market situation, resulting in some market arrangements and supply of certain commodities sometimes being out of order; the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and handicrafts is still somewhat slow; the quality of school teaching still cannot fully meet the requirements of the state; the health work has not fully implemented the policy of serving industry and production; the public security and judicial work have not severely punished and dealt with some activities that sabotage national economic construction and illegal behaviors in a timely manner.

The reasons for these shortcomings are that we have not sufficiently studied and executed the instructions and decisions of the central authorities mechanically and have not worked deeply. But at the same time, we feel that some central departments do not understand the situation below enough, resulting in some places in the work guidance that are not fully in line with reality. For example, in the guidance of improving the management level of factories and mines, there are some generalizations, and some special situations of certain factories and mines are not taken into account, resulting in detours in work. Another situation is that some requirements for certain work are inappropriate, such as employment, eliminating illiteracy, and the five-year continuous primary school system, and the blind increase in hospital beds, all of which have the shortcomings of being too high and too urgent.

To ensure the completion of the general task of the state in the transitional period and to implement the policies and tasks proposed in Premier Zhou's report, we will redouble our efforts, carry forward our achievements, overcome our shortcomings, and continue to advance towards the great socialist society.

专栏：

    在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上
    代表们关于政府工作报告的发言
    董必武代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意周总理的政府工作报告。我谨就政治法律工作方面几个问题，发表一些意见。
    五年来，根据共同纲领的规定，在政权建设方面，我们在彻底摧毁了国民党反动政权机构以后，迅速地建立了以工人阶级为领导的、以工农联盟为基础的各级人民民主政权，普遍地召开了地方各级各界人民代表会议，并使它逐步代行地方各级人民代表大会的职权，选举了地方各级人民政府。特别是从一九五三年起，在全国范围内自下而上地开展了空前的规模巨大的民主选举运动，使人民民主制度走上了更充实更完备的新的阶段，从而进一步地密切了政府同人民群众的联系，巩固了人民民主专政。五年来的政权建设的经验证明：凡是认真发扬了民主，把人民政府的一切重大问题都提交人民代表会议或人民代表大会，在大会和小组会议上展开讨论，并且充分进行批评和自我批评的地方，那里人民的积极性和创造性就能得到发挥，政府工作就有朝气，就可以少犯或不犯官僚主义的错误。
    但是，在普选运动前，有些地方的国家机关的工作人员往往借口工作忙，怕麻烦，不按中央规定和当地工作需要及时召开人民代表会议，而只愿意召开干部会议，也有些地方在人民代表会议已经具备代行人民代表大会职权条件的时候，没有使它及时代行；有的地方虽然召开了人民代表会议和人民代表大会，但是没有充分发扬民主，对于应该展开讨论的重大问题没有认真的进行讨论，没有充分集中群众的意志，只是形式地通过决议，致使人民群众的积极性和创造性不能充分发挥，某些干部的官僚主义作风和某些工作上的错误也不能及时得到纠正。他们没有认识到我们的国家权力属于人民，人民行使国家权力的机关就是人民代表大会或者代行人民代表大会职权的人民代表会议；没有认识到人民代表大会制度是便利于工人阶级实现对国家的领导、便利于集中人民群众意志和力量的最好的组织形式。必须指出，在我们人民民主国家中，任何不重视人民民主权利、违反人民民主制度的现象都是不能容许的。我们在过去的紧张的战争环境中，为了及时地执行各项迫切的任务，在高度发扬群众的革命热情和政治觉悟的基础上，主要地依靠直接动员群众的方式进行工作，因而不可能采取比较完备的民主形式来解决各项重大问题，那是可以理解的。但是，当着有可能采取比较完备的民主形式，并且国家已有了制度规定的时候，那种习惯于简单方式处理问题的做法，就完全不合时宜，而且是违法的了。
    有些地方国家机关工作人员缺乏自我批评精神。他们不是以人民勤务员的态度老老实实地向人民代表会议或者人民代表大会报告工作，接受审查和批评，而是以功臣自居，只谈成绩，不谈缺点，只愿听人奉承赞扬，不愿听人批评，当人民群众对国家机关工作提出意见和批评的时候，往往借口别人不了解工作情况，把人民群众的意见挡回去；甚至有少数人竟对批评者实行压制和报复。这就严重地损害了人民群众政治积极性的发扬，影响了国家机关工作的及时改进。他们不了解人民代表大会不仅有权对一切重大问题作出决定，并且有权批评和监督国家机关的工作和任何国家机关的工作人员。国家机关的工作人员只有虚心接受人民群众的批评和监督的义务，没有拒绝和抵抗批评和监督的权利。任何掩盖缺点和错误，抗拒批评的行为，都是错误的。国家机关工作人员对批评者实行压制和报复，不仅是错误的，并且是一种犯法的行为，是绝对不能容许的。
    所有上述这些缺点和错误，我们过去虽然不断地进行过批判和纠正，但并未完全克服。今后必须在工作中继续加以纠正，进一步发挥人民代表大会制度的优越性，保证宪法的贯彻实施，保证国家社会主义建设和社会主义改造的顺利进行。
    五年来，人民民主法制随着人民民主政治制度的发展和巩固也逐步建立和健全起来。
    中华人民共和国建立以后，按照共同纲领的规定，首先彻底废除了国民党反动政府一切压迫人民的法律、法令和司法制度，先后制定了中华人民共和国婚姻法、土地改革法、工会法、惩治反革命条例、惩治贪污条例和其他许多保护人民的法律、法令，同时有系统地有步骤地建立了各种的人民司法制度。在建立和健全革命法制的过程中，不断地加强国家的公安机关、检察机关和审判机关，有力地保障了社会改革运动和经济建设工作的顺利进行。事实证明，革命法制对于维护革命秩序、巩固人民民主专政、保护人民的民主权利和合法利益、保障国家经济建设是有决定意义的。
    我们的革命法制，也是在同各种错误的思想倾向不断斗争中建立与健全起来的。
    我们的司法机关在前一个时期中组织不纯、思想不纯的现象是严重的，不少旧司法人员存在着浓厚的旧法观点，实际上，就是剥削、压迫人民的反动统治阶级的法律观点。他们的思想中浸透着资产阶级所谓法律是超阶级超政治的荒谬理论，根本不了解人民法律就是为人民服务的。同时他们在司法业务上又沿袭着孤立办案、手续繁琐、刁难群众等衙门作风，甚至颠倒黑白，错判案件，因而就严重地影响了人民司法机关同人民群众的联系。也还有些干部立场不稳，受反动旧法观点的侵蚀，以致歪曲人民法律，敌我不分，模糊了新旧法律的原则界限。为了有效地贯彻革命法制，我们曾进行了反旧法观点旧司法作风的思想斗争。经过这一斗争，各级人民司法机关的组织和工作作风有了显著的改进。但是，必须指出，残余的旧法观点并未完全根绝，它仍在时时影响着我们，须要进行长期的斗争，彻底加以肃清。
    我们的法律是根据各个时期革命斗争的需要并且综合斗争经验而制定的。中华人民共和国建国之初，曾有人主张在那时候就制定出一套完备细密的法律，这是一种脱离实际的、主观主义的想法。因为在当时的军事行动和领导广大人民群众进行土地改革、镇压反革命等社会改革运动中，我们还只能根据需要和可能，综合已经成熟的经验，制定一些单行的通则性的法律和法令，不可能也不应该主观地、生硬地制定一套完备的法律。如果硬要这样做，其结果只能是不合乎实际，只能是束缚群众手足。我们当然不能这样作。但是这并不是说，我们过去就不可以，或者不应该逐步制定一些适合当时情况的法律，更不是说我们的国家过去没有什么法律。那些意见都是错误的，我们曾经屡次批评过。事实上，我们不但在建国之初，就制定了起临时宪法作用的共同纲领，并且接着根据共同纲领和实际情况陆续制定了不少法规，逐步建立起人民民主的法制。这点我前面已经说过。现在国家已进入有计划的建设时期，我们的宪法已经公布，今后不但可能而且必须逐步制定比较完备的法律，以便有效地保障国家建设和保护人民的民主权利。
    有些干部对法律的严肃性认识不足，不按法律办事，不知道运用法律武器来和违法犯罪现象作斗争，例如对于经济建设中发生的事故，常常只注意政治事故而很少注意追究责任事故；同时对责任事故，又常常只注意单纯的教育，而很少注意用必要的法律制裁，以便更有效地消灭和预防违法犯罪的现象。还有些干部居功自傲，不把国家的法律、法令放在眼里，以为法律是用来管老百姓的，似乎自己可以不遵守，违了法也不要紧。这种思想是极端错误的。
    为了保障社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的顺利进行，保障人民的民主权利和合法利益不受侵犯，进一步加强政治法律工作，已成为我们当前的重要任务。今天在某些干部中，由于土地改革、镇压反革命、司法改革等工作已取得的一些成就，滋长着一种骄傲自满的情绪，必须加以纠正。某些干部不了解政治法律工作同经济建设的正确关系，他们忽视政治法律工作对保障社会主义经济建设的决定作用，错误地认为国家只搞经济建设就行了，用不着加强政治法律工作。必须指出，在社会主义经济建设时期，重视经济建设工作是完全正确的，但是在帝国主义和国内阶级斗争还存在的情况下，没有政治法律工作的加强和发展，就不能保障我们的经济建设，保障国家的社会主义工业化。前面指出的那种错误思想的本质，是阶级觉悟不高的表现，也必须加以纠正。
    乌兰夫代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我对周总理的政府工作报告完全同意并衷心拥护。
    内蒙古自治区在中央人民政府领导下推行了区域自治。蒙族人民同各民族人民一样实现了当家作主的权利，加强了民族团结，培养了大批民族干部，较顺利地开展了各项工作，获得了良好的成就。我们根据自治区的特点和各民族人民的要求，进行了土地改革和其他必要的社会改革，恢复、发展了各项生产。全区地方国营工业总产值如以一九四九年基数为一百，到一九五二年已增加为五百一十六，按照今年计划将增至一千三百二十二。全区粮食产量一九五三年已超过解放前最高年产量百分之二十五，今年粮食产量估计可达三百三十五万多公吨。全区牲畜头数以一九四九年基数为一百，到一九五三年即增加为二百一十三。今年牲畜数估计可达一千八百六十多万头，如果同一九四七年内蒙古自治区人民政府成立时比较，已增加一倍半。森林工业木材采伐量以一九四九年基数为一百，到一九五三年已增加为六百六十。国营的和合作社的商业网已遍布到广大的农村和牧区。随着生产的恢复和发展，人民的文化卫生事业也有了显著的发展。一九五三年全区共有初等学校学生五十九万多人，较一九四九年增加百分之九十五；中等学校学生三万三千三百九十二人，较一九四九年增加百分之二百三十八；过去没有高等学校，现在已有高等学校两所，学生八百五十四人。经过积极防治鼠疫和其他疾病，并在大部分牧区普遍地进行防治梅毒后，牧区人口已经停止下降并开始上升，呈现出人畜两旺欣欣向荣的新气象。内蒙古人民政治、经济、文化生活的显著改善，充分地证明了民族区域自治的优越性，它确是解决我国民族问题的钥匙。
    在国家进入有计划的经济建设时期，内蒙古自治区已由推行区域自治为重点进入了进一步建设自治区为重点的新时期。今后内蒙古自治区的基本任务是：根据国家在过渡时期的总任务，按照自治区的具体情况和特点，逐步地进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业。
    在农业区已经建立了国营农场四十处，拖拉机站一处，并大力地发展了农业生产互助合作组织。全区已建立起农业生产合作社一千三百二十六个，预计一九五五年春将发展到六千个，各种互助组现有十一万八千多个，组织起来的农户占总农户的百分之七十左右。
    内蒙古畜牧业的恢复和发展，是贯彻了自由放牧，不斗不分，不划阶级，牧主牧工两利等政策。经过增畜保畜的各种具体措施，发展了畜牧业，提高了牧民的觉悟，我们已经有了条件，通过互助合作的道路，稳步地有计划地对畜牧业实行社会主义改造。现在全区已经建立了国营牧场十七处，牧民的各种互助合作组织已有四千九百六十多个，并试办了三个牧业生产合作社。今后我们仍继续通过互助合作的道路，进行深入的细致的各种工作。我们深信可以在一个相当长的时期内，把现在这种个体的游牧的落后的畜牧业，发展、改造成为社会主义的畜牧业经济。
    过去，由于反动统治阶级实行民族压迫政策，因而造成农业区同牧业区、农民同牧民在土地问题上和农牧业生产上的纠纷和矛盾。在推行区域自治和社会主义改造过程中，我们组织了农业区与牧业区的相互支援，组织了农牧业生产相结合的互助组与生产合作社，这样做的结果，农业区与牧业区以及农牧业生产之间就由过去的矛盾变成了相互支援的关系，蒙汉两族人民同其他兄弟民族人民的经济利益也在自愿互利的基础上结合了起来。在互助合作新的生产关系的实际生活中，我们深切地体验到各民族人民团结互助共同发展的重要意义，从而促进和增强了各民族人民平等友爱、互相帮助、共同发展、亲密团结的新的民族关系。
    今后，随着牧业区经济的发展，通过国营与合作社商业，首先建立以贸易为主的初级市场，使其逐渐形成为政治、经济、文化的综合中心点——草原上的城镇，这样就会更加促进牧区经济的发展，逐渐改变草原的落后面貌。
    包头钢铁工业基地的建设是国家实行社会主义工业化的重大措施之一。为了服务于国家的重点建设，我们大力发展了建筑材料等工业，我们还要动员巨大的力量来努力支援。在矿区附近的群众已表现了他们积极支援祖国工业建设的热忱。他们热心地报矿，帮助钻探队解决用水、住宿等困难。今后我们将继续以这种爱国主义精神教育人民，全力支援包头钢铁工业基地的建设。
    内蒙古自治区的建立和发展，是中国共产党和毛主席的民族政策的光辉胜利，是汉族人民的帮助和全区各民族人民兄弟般的互助合作努力奋斗所得到的成绩。但是，我们在工作中仍然存在着不少缺点和错误需要努力克服。
    首先是对于民族政策的宣传教育还不深入。在有些汉族干部中还残存着大民族主义的错误思想情绪，表现为忽视民族语文工作和民族形式，在帮助培养少数民族干部方面缺乏耐心。也有些少数民族干部残存着地方民族主义的错误思想情绪，不了解汉族人民的帮助是少数民族各种事业发展的重要保证。
    其次是内蒙古工作领导上存在一般化现象，忽视自治区的具体特点。如对我区耕作粗放的农业生产进行技术改进、提高单位面积产量注意不够；在牧业生产中满足于牲畜头数的平均增加，没有抓紧牛马等大牲畜的繁殖工作；在防止自然灾害方面，只满足于一些打草储草的报告数字，没有抓紧领导建立饲料基地；在国营商业和合作社商业方面，只满足于经营数量的增加，对于按照农牧民的生产需要积极供应生产资料和有计划地建立农村、牧区初级市场的工作还缺少切实的调查研究。
    最后就是在自治区领导机关中存在有程度不同的官僚主义现象，工作布置后缺乏及时的检查和总结，一般号召多，具体指导差，这就不可免地滋长了基层干部中的强迫命令作风。
    为了克服缺点，改进工作，我们今后将努力学习，防止骄傲，虚心学习各地区的工作经验，经常开展批评和自我批评，诚心诚意地听取人民群众的批评。
    我们对于中央人民政府的领导和关怀是十分满意的，但是也还感觉有的部门过去对我们的工作督促检查较少，因此，对内蒙古的情况了解不深。如自治机关的编制问题，就长时间得不到适当解决。今后我们需要多向中央各部门反映具体情况，并请中央各部门多到下面检查工作。
    我们这次大会已圆满地制定了中华人民共和国宪法，它是使我国逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化和逐步完成社会主义改造、把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家的重大保证。今后我们一定要切实遵守宪法，紧密团结各民族人民，在中国共产党、毛主席和中央人民政府领导下，在国家过渡时期总任务的光辉照耀下，高度发挥全自治区各民族人民的爱国主义热情和积极性，为解放台湾，为共同建设我们伟大祖国而奋斗。
    李德全代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意周恩来总理的政府工作报告和郭沫若主任关于文化教育工作的发言。我现在就卫生工作问题作一些补充的说明。
    五年以来，我国人民卫生事业，有了很大的发展。
    首先，在卫生防疫工作方面有了很大的成就。这个工作的首要任务是防止霍乱、鼠疫、天花等对人民危害性最大的传染病。几年来，全国共成立了卫生防疫站（队）三百三十七个，各种传染病防治所（站、队）二百三十四处，并及时组织了城乡中西医和卫生工作人员深入群众，普遍接种牛痘和有计划地进行霍乱、鼠疫、伤寒、白喉等各种传染病的预防注射及消毒工作。特别一九五二年在全国范围内开展了爱国卫生运动以来，卫生防疫工作有了显著的进展。在这个运动中进行了群众性的清除垃圾，疏通沟渠，填平污水坑，扑灭蝇、蚊、虱、蚤、老鼠等病媒动物的工作，使有些城市的苍蝇已大为减少，城乡环境卫生面貌也有所改进。这个运动不仅减少和控制了疫病的流行，改善了个人和环境卫生，并且粉碎了美国侵略者的细菌战，提高了人民的卫生知识，逐步革除了旧中国遗留下来的各种不卫生的恶习，起了移风易俗的作用。以危害最大的鼠疫、天花、霍乱等传染病为例：一九五三年发病数与一九五○年相比，鼠疫降低了百分之九十，天花降低了百分之九十五，自一八二○年由海外传入我国以来曾历年流行的霍乱，五年来已经没有发生。
    医疗预防工作也有相当发展。仅就一九五三年卫生行政系统所属的医院和疗养院的病床位数来说，即相当于一九四七年国民党统治时期最高床位的五倍多。工业卫生工作也有一定的发展，仅中央六个工业部和铁道部、中华全国总工会所属新建医院和疗养院的床位数，就相当于解放前全国全部公立医院床位的一点二七倍。卫生工作在水利、筑路、基本建设等工程中，也起了很大的作用。妇幼卫生工作也有了很大的开展，产妇和婴儿的死亡率显著地减低了。少数民族地区的卫生状况也有了显著的改善，疾病死亡日趋减少，人口在逐步上升着。
    今年安徽、湖北、湖南等省发生水灾后，为防止引起严重的疫病，全国卫生机关即大力进行支援。仅安徽一省，由中央、大区和当地人民政府就组织了卫生人员五千九百余名，为受灾区人民服务，减少了灾区人民因水灾而引起的各种疾病的威胁。
    现在全国共有高等医药院校三十一所，在校学生二万九千余人；中等医药学校二百二十所，在校学生五万七千余人。解放后，在高等和中等医药院校毕业的学生已大大地超过了旧中国培养的高级和中级医务人员的总数。新的卫生人才的不断成长，是发展我国卫生事业的重大保证。
    五年来，我国卫生事业的成就虽然很大，但是我们工作中的缺点和错误也是很多的。由于我们对于发展我国社会主义工业的重大意义认识不足，卫生部门未将工业卫生工作列为自己的一项首要任务，以致许多厂矿卫生工作至今还很薄弱，职业病和多发病还严重影响着工人的健康，影响着生产。对于祖国宝贵的医学遗产采取了漠视的态度，未能认真地加以研究；对于为数众多的中医力量和中医在人民卫生事业中的重大作用认识不足，因而对中医采取了轻视、歧视和排斥的错误态度，严重影响了中医力量的发挥。对于爱国卫生运动未能密切地同人民的生产和生活相结合，曾经提出了过高和过多的要求，工作中往往未具体交代政策，因而在不少地区发生过强迫命令的偏向，引起了群众的不满。在医学教育工作中，曾过分强调短期速成和专科重点的作用，对于适应国家长期需要的正规的高等医学教育重视不够。对城市医疗缺乏具体领导、认真整顿，因而制度混乱、效率不高，许多力量未能充分发挥等等。这些缺点和错误，都是卫生工作脱离群众和脱离实际的表现，是政治领导薄弱的结果，在某些方面是资产阶级思想在卫生工作中的具体反映。它给人民卫生事业带来了重大的损失。这些缺点和错误虽已在毛主席和中央人民政府的及时指示下，不断获得纠正，但今后必须认真努力，彻底转变，以便尽快地扫除卫生事业前进道路上的障碍。
    根据国家过渡时期总任务和五年计划的基本任务，今后卫生工作的方针和任务，是要在现有工作的基础上，继续贯彻“面向工农兵”、“预防为主”、“团结中西医”、“卫生工作与群众运动相结合”的四项原则。目前首要的任务是加强工业卫生和改进城市医疗工作，并有步骤地结合互助合作运动开展农村卫生工作，同时要继续开展爱国卫生运动，同危害人民健康最大的传染病作斗争，通过战胜疾病、增进健康，来保证伟大祖国建设事业的胜利进行。为此就必须认真作好以下几项工作：
    第一、继续开展爱国卫生运动。这是预防疾病、增进人民健康的最有效的办法。今后要在结合生产的原则下，继续大力开展，并逐步使之提高和经常化。要随时防止和克服强迫命令和放任自流的偏向。
    第二、加强工业卫生及城乡医疗工作。工业卫生要继续加强领导，健全基层组织，积极依靠工人群众，防治多发病和职业病；城乡医疗要进一步加以整顿提高，在巩固现有的基础上适当加以发展，并继续大力开展妇幼卫生和少数民族地区的卫生工作。目前还应特别重视受灾地区的卫生工作。
    第三、加强中西医的团结。团结中西医，号召中西医互相学习，是必须贯彻的一项原则。现在主要的问题是要立即纠正一切轻视、歧视和排斥中医的观点和作法，改善中医工作，团结和发挥中医的力量。当前的关键是要发动和组织西医学习和研究中国医学遗产，在中西医的合作下，使中国医学遗产得到系统的整理和发扬。
    第四、继续大力培养医药卫生人才。今后医学教育应以办好高等医学教育为重点。为此，要进一步认真学习苏联先进经验，继续进行教学改革，提高教学质量。要在学校中加强马克思列宁主义教育，以培养出有社会主义思想，并具有一定先进医学知识和技术的专门人才。
    随着国家建设事业的不断发展和人民经济生活的不断改善，卫生工作的任务将日益重要和艰巨。目前的成就只是初步地奠定了一个基础，卫生工作人员决不能因此有丝毫的骄傲情绪。卫生工作是以全体人民为服务对象的，是极其广泛的群众事业，只有在广大人民积极支持和监督之下，才能获得更大的发展。我们希望各位代表和全国人民今后不断给我们卫生工作人员以严格的批评和指示。
    薄一波代表的发言各位代表：
    周总理的政府工作报告，我完全同意。现在我想就交通运输和邮电工作，作一补充发言。
    交通运输和邮电工作也同其他国民经济部门一样，经过恢复和发展的阶段。在中华人民共和国成立以后，党和政府都十分关怀交通运输和邮电工作的改进和发展，因而不论在伟大的抗美援朝斗争中，不论在国民经济的恢复和发展中，交通运输和邮电工作都起了巨大的作用。
    解放以来，修复了遭受长期战争破坏的铁路干线九千五百三十四公里，新建了重庆——成都、天水——兰州、来宾——睦南关等新铁路干线二千七百四十公里。连接我国西南部的宝鸡——成都线，今年年底可由成都铺轨到广元。为发展我国西北广大地区政治、经济、文化的兰州——新疆线，现已穿过乌鞘岭继续向西修建。武汉长江大桥也已在一九五三年开工。重建和新建了北京——沈阳、哈尔滨——大连、安东——沈阳等复线九百九十七公里。截至一九五三年底止，全国正线通车里程已达二万四千六百九十公里。
    公路的恢复和新建也有很大成绩，截至一九五三年底止，通车里程已达十三万八千五百公里。新建线路大多是连接祖国边疆和少数民族地区的干线。如雅安——拉萨、成都——阿坝、昆明——佛海等线，这些公路的修通，将促进少数民族地区政治、经济、文化的发展。
    我国商船虽然经过蒋介石匪帮的严重破坏和劫夺，但也得到了发展，一九五三年与一九四九年相比，轮船吨位增加了百分之一百零七点六。
    民用航空事业，从一九五○年八月一日创办，到一九五三年，通航里程已达一万五千九百公里。
    邮电事业也在迅速地发展着，一九五三年同一九四九年相比，邮路增加百分之一百点七，长途电信线路增加百分之六十五点六。
    交通运输工作的成绩还表现在完成了不断增长的运输任务上面。以铁路货物运输周转量为例，如以一九五○年为一百，其逐年增长情况是：一九五一年为一百三十点八，一九五二年为一百五十二点六，一九五三年为一百九十七点二。仅仅三年期间，铁路的货运量就增加了将近一倍，它既反映我国经济恢复和发展的突飞猛进，同时也相应地证明铁路的负荷正在日益加重。
    以上这些成绩的获得，首先是同全国人民的热烈支持分不开的，各地人民都曾积极参加了铁路、公路、航道、港口、电信线路等巨大的修建工程和养护工作。这些成绩的获得又是同广大职工的积极性和创造性分不开的，特别是同他们学习苏联先进管理方法和先进技术分不开的。几年来涌现出大批先进的技术革新运动者和劳动模范。他们在生产过程中都曾发挥了巨大的创造性和先锋作用，他们的模范事迹和先进的工作方法正在日益广泛地在交通运输和邮电事业中传播着和推行着，对于生产的发展已经起了并且还在继续起着巨大的推动作用。
    五年来，交通运输和邮电部门的工作成绩是显著的，完成了国家所给予的任务，但缺点和错误也是很多的，主要表现在下列几个问题上：
    对于我国社会主义经济建设特有的规模和速度必然引向业务量激增的规律认识不足，对于现有交通运输、邮电设备的落后性同国民经济发展速度不相适应的问题，缺乏应有的预见和准备。这在铁路工作上表现的更为明显，一方面表现在对于固定资产的经常养护维修重视不够，另一方面表现在未能更早地提出现有设备的技术改造问题。运输业是国民经济中一个关系复杂的部门，运输工作者除了必须经常熟悉运输业本身的设备能力外，还应求得国民经济发展的各方面的知识，只有这样，才能预见并防止困难，但我们对这种知识都还不够。
    在经营管理方面，还没有很好地发掘现有设备的潜在力量，还没有从生产技术作业的改进中进一步贯彻节约制度，在降低企业成本的工作中还缺乏系统的组织工作。行车和水运事故还很严重。
    根据货物种类、流向、运输距离和各种运输工具的分布情况，组织各种运输工具间的分工和联运，可以更好地发挥现有各种运输设备的效能。过去对于这个问题也缺乏研究，没有认真地去组织。
    在车、船运价和邮、电资费上还有很多不合理的地方，还不能完全反映我国社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的要求。必须根据促进国民经济发展、鼓励国家生产力更合理的分布、为国家积累资金等基本原则逐步加以调整。
    在旅客运输上，由于车、船不足和组织工作的不健全，在繁忙季节和某些区段上，还不能完全满足旅客的需要，对旅客的服务态度也还不能完全令人满意。
    如上所述，我国交通运输和邮电工作几年来是有成绩的，交通运输业执行着国家的运输计划，并且在目前来说，基本上还是能够满足国民经济和人民对运输的需求的。但是如果看不到由于国民经济的急剧发展，目前运输工作已经感到相当紧张的情形，那将要犯严重的错误。这也就是说，当我们考虑到工农业生产迅速发展还要继续不断地带来巨大的运量时，如不及时采取措施，相应地提高运输能力，交通运输就很可能成为国民经济发展的“狭窄地带”。
    提高运输能力的主要办法在于发挥铁路、水运和公路运输的潜在能力，合理地使用国家运输力，逐步对我国现有运输设备进行技术改造。
    加速车、船周转时间对发挥运输潜在能力具有决定的意义，因为车、船周转时间的缩短，就可以节省出更多的运用车、船，就可以完成更多的运输任务。以铁路为例：一九五四年上半年的车辆周转时间中，跑路的时间只占百分之二十八，而百分之七十二的时间都是停在车站上进行装车、卸车、编组、会让、甩挂、上煤、上水。应该承认，我们是还可以从车站停留的时间里再挤出一些时间来的。
    合理地使用国家运输工具，逐步消灭过远、过短、对流和其他不合经济原则的运输，是节省国家运输力减少运输费用的主要方法。大家知道，运输费在产品的总值中占有很大比重。比如一九五三年各部门用在铁路上的货物运输费约为十一万亿元，假如能够把各种不合理的运输减少一些，使运输费能够减少十分之一，就可以给国家节省一万一千亿元。目前正在试办的煤炭分区产销平衡合理运输办法，必须逐步地推行到其他物资方面去。
    均衡地完成国家的运输计划是国民经济各部门的共同任务，除交通运输部门应及时按计划运输外，各发货单位也要按时提出计划并按计划均衡地托运，逐步消灭年初、月初不托运或少托运，年末、月末又大量提出交通运输部门难以负担的货运的现象。
    我国交通运输和邮电的技术改造，在于合理地使用国家的投资，根据业务需要和我国工业发展水平，将我国交通运输和邮电设备用新技术加以改造，使之逐步赶上苏联的先进技术标准。根据初步研究的结果，铁路方面技术改造应以增加列车重量和提高行车密度为原则。逐步增加大型机车，在缺少煤、水和线路坡度大的区段，考虑使用内燃机车或电力机车；增加大型车辆；加强机车车辆修理工厂的设备；逐步把现有主要干线上的杂型钢轨、轻轨改为重型钢轨，增加石碴的厚度和枕木的数量；逐步增加车站，铺设复线，装设自动信号；扩建、改建站场，增加站线，新建机械驼峰调车场；提高用机械装卸货物的比重。水运方面，须要逐步增建新船舶，增加港口的机械装备，建设新港口，疏浚航道，建设航标，建立新的修船基地，并以新的技术装备改造现有修船厂。
    由于我国铁路数量少而且又分布在仅占我国面积约百分之二十的地区上，有计划地修建新铁路线就成为十分必要了。几年来，各地人民经常满怀热情地向毛主席、向中央人民政府建议修建更多的新铁路，这是完全可以理解的。但是大量修建新铁路一方面要同我国重工业发展的水平相适应，另方面还需要有大量的资金和技术人员，因此，新线的修筑还不可能很快，但可断言，新的铁路将一定会一年一年地增多起来。
    必须随着我国汽车制造业和石油工业的发展，逐步增加汽车数量，增建新公路并改善现有公路的情况。对于各地人民自愿修建的地方交通建设工程，应该给予积极的支持和帮助。
    今后邮电工作的任务是改善管理，提高质量，相应地建设新的邮电机构，逐步采用新技术和高级通讯设备，加强主要干线，配合工业城市的建设。
    以上是交通运输和邮电部门已经在进行和今后还要继续进行的工作。
    交通运输和邮电部门的任务也和其他国民经济部门一样，就是为把我国建成为一个伟大的社会主义国家、为提高人民的物质文化生活的水平而斗争。在这里也就明显地反映了我们党和政府的和平政策。但是，与此同时，交通运输和邮电部门也在时刻准备在必要的时候为保卫国家的主权、领土完整和安全而担负自己应有的职责。我们相信，在党和政府的领导下，交通运输和邮电部门的全体职工一定会以无比的积极性和创造性，来胜利地完成人民所给予的任务。
    聂荣臻代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意周恩来总理的政府工作报告。
    五年来，我们伟大的祖国在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的正确领导下，在全国人民团结一致的努力下，在政治、经济、文化和国防建设上取得了光辉的成就，在争取世界持久和平事业上作了巨大的贡献。全国人民正按照中国共产党中央和毛主席所提出的国家在过渡时期的总任务，团结一致，充满信心地向着建设社会主义社会的伟大目标继续前进。
    五年来，中国人民解放军遵照中国共产党的七届二中全会和毛主席的指示，执行了战斗队和工作队的任务，在全国人民的热爱和支援下，以排山倒海的力量，解放了大陆，消灭了大陆上的国民党残余军队，肃清了土匪，奠定了全国统一和社会安定的局面；并在新解放区参与发动人民，完成民主改革，组织人民恢复工农业生产，巩固人民民主专政等光荣任务。在此期间，中国人民解放军的一部，实行了集体转业，直接参加了巨大规模的工业、铁路、交通、水利、农业等社会主义经济建设工作。
    五年来，中国人民解放军遵照毛主席的指示：“我们将不但有一个强大的陆军，而且有一个强大的空军和一个强大的海军。”在现代化建设上获得了很大的成就。现在我们不仅有了强大的陆军和各技术兵种，而且建立了有相当基础的空军和海军。这一支英勇的经过千锤百炼的人民武装力量的日益壮大，成为解放台湾，彻底完成中国人民的伟大解放事业，保卫祖国社会主义建设的可靠保证；而祖国社会主义工业化在苏联伟大无私援助下的每进一步，又为我军现代化提供更好的条件。
    应当指出，当美帝国主义侵略朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，侵占我国台湾，威胁我国安全的时候，中国人民的优秀儿女，组织了中国人民志愿军，同英勇的朝鲜人民军并肩作战，严重地打击了美帝国主义军队及其帮凶军队，取得了朝鲜停战的伟大胜利。中国人民志愿军继承和发扬了中国人民解放军的光荣传统，又以它对美帝国主义作战的宝贵经验，丰富了中国人民解放军。无疑的，中国人民志愿军所作的巨大贡献，是中国人民武装的珍贵财产的一个重要部分，对于中国人民解放军的现代化建设有着重大的意义。
    中国人民解放军清醒地懂得祖国所处的环境和自己所负的任务。朝鲜战争虽然早已停止了，印度支那的和平也恢复了，但是美国的侵略集团并不甘心于自己的失败，为了制造新的紧张局势，扩大对我国的武装干涉和战争威胁，它继续侵占着我国领土台湾，更加加紧利用逃在台湾的蒋介石卖国集团对我国大陆和沿海进行骚扰性和破坏性的战争，策划同蒋介石卖国集团订立所谓“共同安全双边条约”。不久以前，美国所召集的马尼拉会议，签订了敌视亚洲和中国人民的所谓“东南亚集体防务条约”，更使我国的安全和亚洲的和平遭受着严重的威胁。周恩来总理在中央人民政府委员会第三十三次会议上的外交报告，清晰地阐明了这种形势，提出了解放台湾、巩固和平的任务，各民主党派各人民团体为解放台湾联合宣言，庄严地宣布了全国人民一定要解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，彻底完成祖国的解放和统一的神圣事业的决心。人民的意志就是人民解放军的意志，就是人民解放军胜利的保证。全国人民知道，中国人民解放军是从来不辜负人民的期望的。
    五年来军事工作的成绩是巨大的，但是我们的工作还有不少缺点，需要我们去克服；同时，也还有许多带根本性的问题，需要我们去解决。因为，现代化的军事建设，虽然重要的是兵器装备改革问题，但又不只是一个兵器装备改革的问题，而是一个由低级阶段到高级阶段的伟大历史转变，必然要引起组织制度等一系列的改革。这里，我只谈下面两个问题。
    首先，是兵役制度问题。在过去国内革命战争时期，曾经是正确地保证了人民革命胜利的志愿兵役制度，现在已不应该、也不可能继续下去了，而应该以新的义务兵役制度予以代替。中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领中曾规定了：“准备在适当时机实行义务兵役制”，随着社会改革和民主改革的完成，人民政治觉悟的提高，人民民主专政的巩固，实行义务兵役制度，现在已经不仅成为现代军事建设的迫切需要，并且成为人民群众的共同要求了。因为如不实行义务兵役制，就不可能为国家准备一定数量的、经过训练的后备兵源；就不可能进一步减少国家常备兵的数量，撙节国家财政开支；就不可能解决兵士的服役、待遇、婚姻、家庭等一系列的问题，从而影响部队的战斗力，增加复员转业的困难。同时，长期只让少数志愿参军的士兵服役，而绝大多数人却不能尽服兵役的义务，不能享受在中国人民解放军这样一个社会主义大学校里，提高政治觉悟、学习军事技术、提高文化水平、锻炼增强体质的权利，显然是不合理的。因此，我们希望能根据宪法规定：“保卫祖国是中华人民共和国每一个公民的神圣职责。依照法律服兵役是中华人民共和国公民的光荣义务”，及早颁布中华人民共和国兵役法，付诸实施。
    当然，义务兵役制度实施的初期，并不是没有困难的。这些困难主要是我们对于兵役制度还缺乏经验，历史上反动统治阶级的征兵即是抓丁，在一部分人民群众中还残留着有害的影响。这就必须加强对人民群众的爱国主义教育和义务兵役制度的优越性的宣传，并作好缜密的组织准备工作。
    其次，随着义务兵役制度的施行，还必须制订军官服役办法和解决职业军人的待遇问题。在过去国内革命战争时期，中国人民解放军实行着长期的供给制度，这是正确的。因为那时我军还不可能从统一的国家政权的国库中领取军费，而要靠自己筹粮筹款，自己动手生产，或者只靠农民交公粮来维持军费。在中华人民共和国成立五年来，我们仍然保持着供给制度，这也是正确的。因为国家在过渡时期的头几年，还必须进行肃清大陆上的国民党残余军队和土匪的战争，进行大规模的社会改革和生产恢复工作，同时也还因为义务兵役制度尚未实行。现在则有必要和可能在职业军人中，以薪金制来代替供给制了。如不实行薪金制，则以军事工作为职业的军官，将不可能以自己的薪金来赡养家庭，增加他们对家庭生活的顾虑；同时，由于供给制所产生的浪费、平均主义、结婚限制等等不合理的现象，则已经成为军事建设的障碍。而实行薪金制，足以克服浪费，鼓励上进，有利于军事建设。当然，中国人民解放军的职业军人完全懂得，国家必须集中力量进行社会主义工业化建设，全国人民必须节衣缩食为工业化积累资金，因而在一个时期内，薪金制只能是低薪制。我们希望中央人民政府早日规定军队中职业军人的薪金制度，付诸实施。
    全国人民代表大会会议的召开，对于中国人民解放军将发生巨大的动员和鼓舞作用。中国人民解放军将在中华人民共和国主席的统率下，在中国共产党的领导下，继续发扬艰苦奋斗、英勇牺牲、亲密团结、遵守纪律、克服困难、坚忍不拔的优良传统，努力学习苏联军事科学，加强政治和军事训练，熟练掌握现代军事技术，建设成为一支优良的现代化的革命军队，坚决完成全国人民所付托的解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团、保卫祖国社会主义建设、保卫亚洲及世界和平的光荣任务。已经站起来的中国人民，决不允许任何帝国主义再来侵犯我国的领土！
    邵象华代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我们听了周总理关于政府工作的报告。这个报告正确地指出了几年来我国人民在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的领导下，在保卫和平、建设社会主义社会的伟大任务中所取得的光辉成就，也指出了全国人民今后努力的方向。请允许我对周总理的这个报告表示最热烈的拥护！
    作为在祖国第一个钢铁基地鞍钢工作的工程技术人员，我深切地体会到党和政府集中主要力量发展重工业、使国家逐步实现社会主义工业化这一英明政策的重大意义。鞍钢在日本占领期间，生铁的最高年产量是一百三十多万吨；现在我们只开了一部分高炉，但产量就达一百五十万吨。在钢方面，我们只开了两个炼钢厂中较小的一个，而今年的钢锭产量就将超过过去两厂最高总年产量百分之十九左右。许多原有的轧钢厂，生产能力都达到了伪满最高纪录的两倍甚至三倍以上。新建的大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂和薄板厂，以及许多旧厂，正在生产着新品种的钢材。由于采用了苏联的技术标准，产品质量都比以往有了提高。这些都是党的总路线的胜利，是中央人民政府正确领导的结果。
    在旧中国，我们不少人也曾做过发展重工业的美梦。我们迷信着“工业救国”，满想凭自己的一点技术能力，来挽救中国的落后。那时我们不知道反动的社会制度是发展工业的根本障碍。许多“工业救国”的美梦，结果都归幻灭。只有在共产党领导中国人民推翻了黑暗的反动统治，建立了工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的中华人民共和国以后，我们工程技术人员才能同工人一起，发挥自己的创造性和积极性。我们看到在旧社会中多少年来不能实现的梦想今天正在成为现实，感到说不出的兴奋和喜悦。
    鞍钢几年来的成就是同苏联的援助分不开的。我们的工人和技术人员以很大的热情跟苏联专家学习，逐渐掌握了先进的技术。这使规模巨大的几座新厂都能迅速建成并顺利投入生产。在原有厂矿中，也在苏联专家帮助下完成了许多技术上的革新，使产量、质量和劳动条件有了显著的提高和改善。
    全国各地的支援，也给鞍钢的恢复和发展创造了条件。
    但在我们工作中也还有不少缺点和问题。特别是在技术管理上，目前还存在着某种程度的紊乱状态。各级生产技术干部的职责范围不够明确，正常的生产秩序没有完全建立，因此在产量上、质量上、按定货品种完成生产上，有时还发生相当大的波动。这自然会影响到订货单位的工作，对整个国民经济是不利的。中央人民政府重工业部已提出加强技术管理作为今后一段时期的中心工作，我感到这是非常适时而必要的。我希望重工业部对这一中心工作加强具体领导。
    我们向社会主义迈进的第一个宪法的制定已经胜利完成了。鞍钢的工程技术人员将同全体职工一起，为超额完成第一个五年建设计划所给予我们的生产建设任务，以更多更好的钢铁供应各地，为支援解放台湾，为实现祖国的社会主义工业化而奋斗。
    陈绍宽代表的发言主席，各位代表、各位同志：
    我代表福建全省人民和省人民政府对周总理的政府工作报告表示完全同意和热诚拥护，并决为报告所指示的今后任务而努力。
    中国共产党和毛主席领导全国人民革命，获得了伟大胜利，建立了中华人民共和国，五年来在国内国际都得到辉煌成就，这就为建设社会主义社会创造了有利条件，并使世界和平力量大大增强和发展。我们感谢毛主席，感谢中国共产党。
      一九四九年夏间，英勇善战的中国人民解放军进军福建，迅速取得了全省解放的伟大胜利，消灭了蒋匪军十余万人。在解放初期，全省各地土匪不下七万余人，台湾、金门又不断地从海上派遣武装特务土匪潜入。美帝国主义侵占台湾之后，时时策动残余蒋匪在福建沿海登陆窜扰，海上海匪和内陆匪特活动更加嚣张。因此我们一面加紧剿匪，一面巩固海防，不久就把数十年的匪患肃清了，全省人心安定，社会安宁。经过抗美援朝运动和各种社会改革工作，福建同全国各地一样，在经济恢复和经济建设工作中，获得了显著的成绩和巨大的胜利，使全省社会面貌焕然一新，人民群众政治觉悟和生产积极性空前提高，人民民主专政更加巩固，工农业生产逐步恢复和发展，人民的物质生活和文化生活也日益改善。福建在解放前向来是粮食不足的省份，土地改革之后，我们粮食生产不独足够供给全省军民之用，而且还能够支援兄弟地区。经过关于国家过渡时期总任务的宣传和教育，人民群众的社会主义觉悟大大提高，社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业更进一步向前发展，全省人民正在为贯彻社会主义建设而努力奋斗。
    美帝国主义勾结蒋介石卖国贼，企图签订所谓“共同安全双边条约”，妄想长期侵占台湾，作为进攻我国大陆的军事基地。台湾是我国领土，不许任何国家侵占，不许蒋介石卖国集团窃踞。台湾同胞还在水深火热中迫切等待解放，我们一定要解放台湾，这是全国六万万人民的意志，特别是我们福建人民的要求。福建处在海防最前线，同台湾仅隔一海峡，福建人民受蒋介石卖国贼残害特重，对蒋贼和他的卖国集团愤恨特深。前一个月，在福建省人民代表大会会议上，全体代表对于解放台湾、金门及沿海岛屿表示坚决拥护，并表示努力增加生产，竭力支援解放金门、台湾，要人有人，要粮有粮。福建人民二十多年来一直坚持着人民革命旗帜，对于解放台湾具有信心和决心。我们自解放以来，对于解放台湾的准备工作一直没有停止过，全省人民万众一心，踊跃支援，争取胜利完成这一神圣的历史任务。我们一定更加坚强地团结全省人民，同全国人民一道，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的领导下，为解放台湾、金门坚决奋斗到底。
    我中央人民政府对跟随蒋介石卖国贼逃到台湾的人的政策是宽大的：除蒋贼一人而外，任何人都容许弃暗投明，回到大陆与家人团聚，任何人都可以受到立功赎罪、既往不究的宽大待遇。蒋介石卖国贼统治下的一切海军人员们，将士们，应该从速立功，早日回到祖国怀抱，勿再迟疑，错失机会。
    福建解放后，全省公路甚见发展，厦门和大陆间业已填成海堤，使交通更见便利，海防也更加巩固。但是海路被美帝国主义和蒋贼阻碍，不能畅通，陆路只靠公路汽车是不够的，希望中央对于福建的铁路提前修筑，使福建交通运输更加便利。
    申纪兰代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我是一个志愿军的家属，李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社的副社长。我听了周总理的政府工作报告，十分满意。几年来，政府对妇女解放、妇女参加劳动生产、参加社会活动，非常关心；特别对我们军属的照顾，更是无微不至。我亲切地体会到，我们的政府，真正是人民的政府。
    我们那里是老根据地，在抗日战争时期，已贯彻了男女平等、婚姻自主的政策。十多年来，妇女同男人一道，响应毛主席的号召，参加了互助合作组织和劳动生产。一九五一年冬，我村成立了农林畜牧生产合作社，妇女的生产情绪更加高涨。但生产技术还赶不上男人。政府为了提高妇女的技术和文化，提倡男教女学；开办短期训练班，专门训练女技术员；建立了民校，提高妇女的文化程度，我自己本来一字不识，现在已能认得二千多字了。这样，妇女很快就学会了选种浸种、播种、拔苗锄苗、刨地垒岸，有的还学会了犁地。同时，政府为了解决妇女劳动生产中的困难，在我们县里还普遍建立了妇幼保健站、接生站，并且帮助我们建立了农忙托儿所。
    但我们社里在开始时期还没有实行男女同工同酬。一个妇女不管你劳动多好，一天顶多只能得到半个劳动日的报酬。这是很不合理的。为了争取男女同工同酬，我们在共产党和人民政府的领导和帮助下，进行了很大的努力和斗争。经过不断的劳动竞赛，我们不但实现了男女同工同酬的原则，而且提高了我们妇女的社会主义觉悟，也提高了人们对男女平等的认识。
    一九五三年，我社妇女除家务劳动外，在全年一万一千多个劳动日中所得到的劳动日就占了百分之三十四。这一事实说明了：要建设社会主义社会，没有妇女参加是不行的。
    由于参加了互助合作组织和劳动生产，妇女的社会地位提高了，家庭地位也提高了。过去妇女挨打受气的不和睦的家庭，现在已变成民主和睦的新家庭。无论什么事都可以商量着办。青年妇女都穿上了花布，盖上了花被子。我们相信，到了社会主义社会，妇女的生活一定更幸福。我只是千百万妇女中的一个，像我这样参加了生产合作社的领导工作的还有很多妇女。以我们山西长治专区来说，十五个县三千七百多个农业生产合作社里，就有女社长九个，女副社长四千零三个。像我们社里就有三个女副社长。妇女还参加了各级政权工作，管理国家大事。我们深切地体会到，妇女受了几千年的压迫，只有在共产党、人民政府和毛主席的领导下，只有参加劳动生产，走社会主义道路，才能真正得到解放。
    但我们工作中还有不少缺点。比如我们在发动妇女参加劳动生产时，没有照顾到妇女的身体条件和家务劳动，只顾拚命竞赛，以致影响到妇女的健康和家庭的和睦关系。根据我自己的体会，妇女参加劳动生产，争取男女平等，在开始的一个很长时期内，阻力很多，如果没有各方面的支持，没有妇女本身的努力，就会受到挫折，产生悲观失望情绪；但妇女一经发动起来之后，又容易发生拚命主义的偏向。这个问题是动员占人口半数的妇女参加社会主义建设的大问题，过去有些领导机关对这个问题不很注意，因而使妇女工作不免要发生偏向，甚至不能得到及时纠正。希望今后能够引起注意。
    最后，我们要根据周总理的报告和这次会议的精神，进一步改进我们的工作，为了和平，为了社会主义，我们妇女一定要继续贡献出更大的力量。
    林铁代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意并衷心拥护周总理的报告，保证坚决贯彻执行。
    五年来，我们国家在各个方面的成就是伟大的，进步是飞跃的。这充分地证明了我们的人民民主专政的国家制度的极大的优越性。我们的国家是工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的。在人民民主制度下，各民主阶级、民主党派和人民团体结成了广泛的统一战线。我们的国家采取了最便利于集中人民群众的意志、吸引人民群众来参加国家管理的一种组织形式，同时它的一切内外政策都是为了达到增进人民利益和巩固世界和平的目的。它对于广大人民实行高度的民主，而对于人民的敌人实行严厉的专政。这一切，保证了我们的政府是真正属于人民的，并始终为人民服务。正因为这样，所以我们政府的任何号召和措施，都能够获得人民群众的热烈赞助和全力支持。这就是我们的政府工作能在短短的五年中获得这样伟大成就的基本原因。
    同时，我们的各级国家领导机关实行广泛的正确的批评和自我批评，特别提倡人民群众的自下而上的批评和监督；对于人民群众的批评采取热烈欢迎和坚决保护的革命态度，而对于一切不欢迎批评、阻碍批评和对批评者实行打击报复的现象展开了坚决的斗争。这就使得广大人民群众日益清楚地看到我们的政府是真正全心全意地为人民服务的，使得我们的工作能够在不断克服自己的缺点和错误中，永远生气勃勃地前进。以河北地区来说，也可以看出由于旧社会的影响和教育工作的不够，各级领导机关中的官僚主义、主观主义等现象是程度不同地存在着的，有的还相当严重，甚至有少数坏分子混入我各级领导机关进行违法乱纪的勾当，严重地损害国家和人民的利益。对于这些现象，我们曾在上级政府的检查督促和人民群众的批评监督下，不断地进行了斗争和处理，例如，一九五三年处理前武安县县长贾筱民违法乱纪无耻迫婚的案件，将贾撤职并依法查办，就是一个例子。这样的处理在人民群众中引起了很好的影响。但这并不是说我们的批评和自我批评已经很够了。在我们的工作中还存在着许多缺点和错误，克服政府工作的官僚主义作风还缺乏经常的有力的措施；同时，上级各领导机关对于我们工作的严格的检查，曾经对我们有很大的帮助，但这种检查在过去也还是很不充分，很不经常的。另外，我们还感觉中央有些部门，由于对各地具体情况了解不够，因而在指导各地工作上还存在着一般化的缺点。为了不断地改进我们的工作，我认为在政府工作领导上，还应当继续开展反对官僚主义的斗争，以进一步密切联系人民群众和巩固人民民主专政，并保障社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的顺利进行。
    我们的大会已经制定了中华人民共和国宪法。在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的英明领导下，我们的国家正在向着社会主义的伟大目标前进。作为一个人民代表，我深深地感到责任的光荣和重大；同时我也深信：只要我们能够热爱人民，信赖人民，效忠于人民，人民必定能够继续信任我们，帮助和监督我们把工作做好。正因为这样，所以我完全有信心把这个责任担当起来，老老实实地作一个人民的勤务员，这就是我的愿望。
    梁希代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告。
    在周总理的报告中指出了我国经济建设的伟大成就，也批评了缺点，我联想到五年来的林业工作，也是有很多缺点的。现在我把林业发展情况简要介绍一下，并请各位代表批评指教。
    共同纲领规定：“保护森林，并有计划地发展林业。”
    五年来，跟着经济建设的发展，林业工作也获得了初步的成就。护林防火方面，一九五三年全国森林火灾面积比一九五○年减少了百分之七十四，护林防火在许多地方已成为群众习惯。造林方面，形成了在我国史无前例的群众造林热潮和造林规模。一九五○年造了十二万公顷（一公顷等于十五市亩），一九五三年就发展到全年造林一百十一万公顷，等于反动的国民党政府时代二十二年间造林面积的两倍。在这些造林中，有东北西部和内蒙古东部长一千一百多公里、宽二、三百公里范围内的防护林；有东起府谷西至定边的陕北防沙林；也有业已基本完成全部计划的河北西部和河南东部防沙林。在造起防护林的地区，已显著地看到了耕地面积扩大、作物产量提高的成果。例如河南开封附近有个土城乡，过去不能种小麦，造林后，一九五一年种小麦七百一十亩，每亩收四十六斤，一九五三年扩大到三千二百亩，每亩产量增加到一百一十斤。森林调查设计方面，长白山二百二十六万多公顷森林，已作出了合理的经营方案；大、小兴安岭二千万公顷森林的上空，正在进行着航空测量和航空调查。
    森林工业方面，已发展成为一个相当大的生产企业，全国共有五十一个森林工业局，六十七个木材加工厂、林产化学厂和附属企业，二千多公里森林铁路及三十余万职工，五年来，保证了国家建设所需木材的供应。东北和内蒙古是中国主要的木材供应基地，解放后，在苏联专家帮助下，实行了生产改革，加强了基层企业管理机构，实行了作业计划及调度制度，发展了机械化，从而提高了劳动生产率。在伪满时代，每生产一万立方公尺木材，需要八百八十八名工人，我们在一九五三年每生产一万立方公尺，只需要一百三十一名工人。职工的物质生活和文化生活也比从前提高了，许多主要林区，设立着小学校、医院、疗养所、商店、俱乐部等，带岭林区还有养老院。
    然而，我们不能因此而骄傲自满，我们五年来的缺点很多，扼要地说，有下列几点：
    （一）对群众路线贯彻不够。一九五三年合作造林面积，达到总造林面积的百分之五十，这固然是很好的，然而有些地方强迫全乡全村人参加，违反了自愿互利的原则。封山育林，对消灭荒山和保持水土，的确是最经济最有效的办法，全国已封了四百八十七万公顷；可是，这里头有不少强迫命令、不照顾放牧和樵采的做法，引起一些群众不满。在护林防火方面，有些地方无条件地严禁群众入山，对打猎、采药、采菰等副业生产照顾不够。在营造防护林中，有些地方因对群众教育不够或规划不当，也使一部分农民不满。
    （二）计划性不够。在森林工业的基本建设方面，没有很好进行调查勘测。作出全面规划与总体设计，因而许多建设计划存在着颇大的盲目性。工程项目也变化太多。在原木生产方面，往往一般材种大量超额生产，而坑木和枕木却不能完成计划；或者产品规格质量不能完成计划。在造林方面，用什么树种，造什么林，造在什么地方，有许多地区，在事前没有一个全盘计划。
    （三）经营管理水平不高。就整个森林而论，国有林除长白山外，过去还没有精密的调查，没有完整的经营方案，因此更新（在采伐了的地方重新造林）跟不上采伐。五年来，全国采伐迹地（采伐了的林地）估计有一百多万公顷，而更新只有十七万多公顷，这样采伐下去，再加上火灾损失和虫害损失，中国森林将越来越少，这是很危险的。在森林工业方面，还有劳动纪律松弛、财务开支混乱、任用职员超过定员、伤亡事故相当严重的现象。
    这些缺点，我们在今后工作中一定要加以纠正。为了“有计划地发展林业”，我们根据国家过渡时期总任务，拟在今后若干年内采取下列几项措施：
    （一）对国有林逐步实行科学的经营管理。就是说，经过周密的调查、勘测、设计，算出木材蓄积量、作出森林保护、抚育、采伐及更新方案。
    （二）营造用材林。从今年开始，在南方大量营造，逐渐达到每年一百万公顷，估计三十年后每年可出木材一亿立方公尺。
    （三）营造水源林和防护林。在黄河、淮河、永定河等各水系的中上游，将规划和开始营造水源林。对西北的防沙林进行整体规划；对东北西部、内蒙古东部的防护林，拟在十年内营造完毕。
    （四）开发新林区。为了增加木材生产，将在第一个五年计划内开发大、小兴安岭南坡及西北的白龙江林区，并为第二个五年计划的开发长白山及大兴安岭北坡作好准备。
    （五）划分经济区。我们建议，根据各地经济条件及群众生产习惯，将宜农、宜林、宜牧地区，大体上加以划分，使农、林、牧得到平衡发展，不发生相互间的矛盾。
    总之，为了一方面保证供应工业用材，一方面又保障农田水利，我们将在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，在中央人民政府领导下，联合农业、牧业、水利、燃料工业工作者和植物、昆虫、土壤及其他科学工作者，同广大群众一道，向全国三万万公顷的荒山斗争；向陕北一千几百市里长的沙龙斗争；向大小河流，特别是三千年来给中国人民带来灾难的黄河斗争。要努力做到黄河流碧水，赤地变青山！
    杨惟义代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    听了周总理的政府工作报告后，我感觉到无限兴奋，完全同意和拥护。
    自解放以来，国家在各方面都有飞跃的进步。经过土地改革和各种社会改革，工农业生产大为提高，金融物价稳定，旧社会的面貌已完全改变。人民民主制度日趋完备，使人民能享受到真正民主的幸福。全国人民密切团结在人民政府的周围，业已成为革命的大家庭。抗美援朝和日内瓦会议的伟大胜利，使我国的国际地位空前提高，世界民主阵容也大为加强。这些伟大的成就，不仅为有计划的大规模经济建设准备了必要条件，并且为把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义社会创造了良好的开端。
    我是一个研究昆虫科学的人，总想把自己学得的一点东西，替人民做些事情，但是在国民党反动统治下，被视为无用之人，一切治虫办法都做不通，潦倒半生，一事无成。解放以后，我感到有希望了，便于一九五○年，向江西省人民政府建议，要注重应用耕作方法，来消灭螟虫灾害。即蒙采纳，并在全省大力展开了三耕运动——积极秋耕，普遍冬耕，提早春耕，拔除禾兜和铲除田边杂草。事实证明，这是消灭螟灾最简而易行的有效办法。四年来，江西农作物的害虫逐渐减少，尤其是为害最大的三化螟，基本上已不再成灾，对于农业增产，起了一定的作用。我能对广大人民有一点贡献，感到非常高兴。由这一桩事实，可以说明我们人民政府对于人民生产、生活和科学的重视。科学工作者在这个进步的时代，正可贡献自己的力量，发挥积极性，来替国家和人民做些事情了。只要在科学上有一点好的意见，人民政府没有不采用的。我决以最大努力，为社会主义建设和社会主义改造的伟大事业而奋斗。
    此外，还有二点不成熟的意见，也附带提出来，以供有关部门研究：
    一、去年江西统购余粮，本来是一件极好的事情。但由于部分干部在工作中没有认真进行调查，对有些农民的部分必需的口粮，亦勉强劝他们当作余粮拿出来卖。到了今年春天，农民又要从远地去购买粮食。这样不但是浪费了农民的劳动力，妨碍生产，而且在农民群众中引起一些不满情绪。今年统购余粮时，希望能够不重复这种现象。
    二、江西农村中实行食油计划供应后，农民觉得油量太少，颇有意见。按江西人民生活习惯，食油供应量似乎需要增加些。现在全国食油的产量，还不能满足城乡的需要，须再大力号召，多种油料作物。今年冬季，就要抓紧季节，号召南方各省多种油菜。
    这些都是不大成熟的意见，把它提出来，以供参考，并请批评。
    史良代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的召开和中华人民共和国宪法的通过，是中国人民政治生活中具有重大历史意义的事件，它标志着我们国家更进一步民主化。这是值得我们兴奋的。因此，我要向各位代表，尤其是我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，致以热烈而崇高的敬礼！大会上周总理关于政府工作的报告，我完全拥护。现在我把五年来的司法工作向大会作一个简要的发言，请予以指示。
    五年来的司法工作是同国家的政治任务和各个时期的中心工作紧密地结合进行的。在国家经济恢复时期，各地人民法院主要是运用人民法庭这一组织形式，配合了扫除帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义三大敌人的残余势力的各项社会改革运动。在土地改革和镇压反革命运动中，严厉地打击了敌人，巩固了革命秩序。其次，在“三反”、“五反”、贯彻婚姻法和普选运动中，制裁了犯罪分子，保护了人民。这就从司法工作方面，推动和保障了各项运动的顺利完成。
    随着国家经济建设时期的到来，人民司法机关及时地把保护国家财产、保障国家经济建设和社会主义改造事业的顺利进行，作为自己的首要任务。根据几年来的统计材料，人民法院所受理的直接破坏国家经济建设和社会主义改造事业的案件，约可分为：反革命分子的暗害破坏；不法资产阶级分子的各种违法罪行；国家机关、企业工作人员的贪污盗窃和因怠工失职而造成的重大责任事故。其中危害最大的是反革命破坏，其次是不法资产阶级分子的犯罪行为。各地人民法院严肃和慎重地处理了这些案件，在保护国家经济建设上起了良好作用。对反革命破坏案件的处理，大大地提高了人民群众的政治警惕性和劳动积极性。上海市大投机奸商陆志明抢购大量植物油料，严重破坏市场管理，被依法惩处后，守法工商户表示：“这样做完全必要，这样才可以划清守法与违法的界限。”对于国家机关、企业工作人员的贪污盗窃行为的制裁，保护了国家财产，在改造社会风气上起了重要作用。对工矿、交通企业中因玩忽职守、消极怠工造成重大责任事故的刑事罪犯予以惩处后，受到了职工群众的普遍欢迎，加强了劳动纪律，改善了责任制度，提高了生产效率。我们为了把司法工作深入工矿交通企业，除了一般加强对破坏国家经济建设案件的审判工作外，并在铁路、水上运输沿线建立了专门法院。为了对公私经济合同实行法律监督，减少违反合同的行为，现已有很多城市人民法院举办了公证工作。在农村，县人民法院主要是运用巡回法庭积极地保障农业生产和互助合作运动的顺利进行。
    人民法院一向把保护公民的民主权利和合法利益作为自己的经常任务。由于人民司法机关对侵害公民生命、身体和财产的罪犯进行了坚决的斗争，由于我们人民民主制度本身的优越性，侵害公民权益的案件日趋下降，如以强盗案件为例，一九五三年即比一九五○年下降了百分之九十五点一。人民法院在人民群众中的威信日益提高，人民有了纠纷不能解决时，很自然地请求自己的法院为他们解决。这同国民党反动法院“衙门向南开，有理无钱莫进来”和群众“屈死不告状”的情况，恰成鲜明的对照。
    人民法院在处理上述大量的案件中，绝大多数是正确的，但由于收案数量超过了人民法院主观的负担能力，致使案件时有积压，有些人民法院也有过判决失轻失重和错判的情形。各地人民法院本着对人民负责的精神，对积案不断地进行清理，对错案则认真检查和改正。目前正在进一步加强司法建设来减少与防止积压案件和错判案件的发生。
    人民法院是人民民主专政的武器之一，我们对旧的反动法院机构不能简单地接管过来现成地使用，必须彻底加以粉碎，必须对旧的司法人员进行思想改造。解放之初有些干部对此认识不清，以致有不少人民法院在接收国民党反动法院的烂摊子后，曾一度在政治上、组织上和思想上存在过严重不纯的现象。为此，各级人民法院大张旗鼓地开展了反对旧法观点、反对旧衙门作风以及整顿组织的司法改革运动。从而有效地打击了残存的旧法观点和旧衙门作风，尖锐地批判了“法律是超阶级的、超政治的”以及“办案是单纯技术工作”等反动的和错误的观点。在干部思想上基本上划清了新旧法律的思想界限，并初步树立了马克思列宁主义的国家观与法律观。同时，还进行了组织整顿，对于混入人民法院的少数反革命分子和贪赃枉法分子，实行了依法惩处；对于不适宜作人民司法工作者，则另给以其他工作和生活的出路；对于那些经过思想改造而有进步的人员，则是继续使用。与此同时，各级人民法院补充了一批忠实于国家和人民的干部，因而基本上改变了过去组织不纯的严重现象。这里应当指出，对于原在旧法院中工作而曾参加过革命斗争和民主运动的进步人士，则从未当作旧司法人员看待。还必须指出，五年以来他们在工作中都有一定的进步。
    在司法改革的基础上，为进一步地便利人民诉讼和解决纠纷，各地人民法院逐步地建立了巡回法庭，人民接待室、人民调解委员会的组织，还有若干人民法院并试行了人民陪审员制度。这些组织建设受到人民群众的欢迎和称赞，今后尚须进一步提高，更好地为人民服务。
    五年来人民司法工作虽然是有成绩的，但目前还存在许多缺点。主要是还没有在全体司法干部中普遍和巩固地树立起司法工作必须为经济建设服务的思想。有的强调干部少、无经验等原因，不去主动地为经济建设服务；甚至有的思想麻痹，对在经济建设中的各种破坏活动熟视无睹，认为“没啥问题”，放弃了自己应尽的职责。有一些干部在执行惩罚与教育相结合的政策上，对经过历次运动处理后仍进行罪恶活动的反革命分子、贪污分子和盗窃分子，未能全面地贯彻“过去从宽”“今后从严”的方针；对惯窃、骗子、流氓等刑事罪犯，有惩罚过轻的偏向；此外，对应予以法律制裁的重大责任事故，亦多缺乏严肃处理。也有不少司法干部对人民法院的民主制度建设不力，甚至个别干部有不尊重当事人的民主权利的行为。
    应当指出，上述缺点和错误的存在是同我们领导上的官僚主义分不开的。由于我们缺乏认真的检查工作，因而对于各地人民法院存在的关键问题，未能及时地发现和妥善地解决。我们深感目前司法建设还赶不上国家与人民的需要，但相信在中国共产党、全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会的领导下，这些缺点和错误是能够克服的。今后必须严格执行宪法和人民法院组织法以及一切法律的规定，大力加强人民司法建设，进一步巩固人民民主专政，以保障国家的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的顺利进行，保障公民民主权利不受侵犯。
    成柏仁代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意周恩来总理的政府工作报告。五年来，中央人民政府和地方各级人民政府在许多工作中做出了极其辉煌的成绩，把人民革命和国家建设的伟大事业，不断地推向前进。这五年的成就，超过了中国历史上任何时期不知多少倍。
    中国共产党和毛主席领导全国人民，经过三十多年的艰苦斗争，终于推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的反动统治，建立了中华人民共和国，肃清了蒋介石匪帮在我国大陆上的残余武装，安定了社会秩序。进行了伟大的抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命分子、“三反”、“五反”、知识分子思想改造等一系列的运动。这就不但从根本上巩固了人民民主专政，提高了全体人民的爱国主义和社会主义的觉悟，而且从思想意识上和生活实践中，也大大地清除了长期存留的旧社会的一切污毒。在这样的基础上，我们才很迅速地恢复了被国民党反动政权和帝国主义所长期破坏了的国民经济，发展了生产，稳定了物价，相应地进行了文化教育建设工作，并从一九五三年起开始了第一个五年经济建设计划。逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的事业，在祖国向社会主义过渡的伟大历史时期，成为全国人民共同奋斗的任务。
    应该特别指出的是：中央人民政府在党和毛主席的英明领导下，五年以来的每一重大措施，都是史无前例的，都是深入人心的。三大运动不必说了，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争中，也真正做到了大张旗鼓，雷厉风行，虽负重要责任的共产党员，犯了错误，造成罪行，也同样地受到了国法、党纪的制裁。当时新疆有一位起义将领，对这一运动就很激动的说：“这一下共产党一定万岁。”这并不是偶然的。
    在国际事务中，五年以来，也同样地做出了非常光辉的成绩，我国同苏联签订了伟大的中苏友好同盟互助条约；我国参加了日内瓦会议；中印总理、中缅总理分别地发表了联合声明，提出了：互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的五项原则。我们更多地团结了国际朋友，壮大了以苏联为首的和平民主力量，大大提高了我国的国际威望。凡世界大事，特别是亚洲大事，没有中华人民共和国参加，就不可能得到合理解决。这些伟大胜利，结束了百年以来我们历史上的屈辱外交，主动地进入了国际政治舞台，取得了我国在世界大国中应有的地位。我全国各族同胞，都衷心地感激中国共产党和毛主席，感激以周总理为首的我国出席日内瓦会议的代表团。
    但是，不可讳言，我们在生产中、工作中、学习中，还有许多缺点和错误。我们的批评和自我批评开展得还不够，尤其是自下而上的批评，更不容易开展，有压制、打击批评的，有掩盖事实真相而千方百计逃避批评的，有计较个人利益而不敢批评的，也有世故甚深，对坏人坏事三缄其口而不愿批评的。总之，这都是资产阶级个人主义思想在作怪，都不是热爱祖国、热爱正义事业的表现。我们应该提倡正直大胆的批评，要求任何一个受批评者，都应虚怀若谷，休休有容；任何一个批评者也要本“治病救人”、“爱人以德”的古训，为保卫祖国利益和保护人民利益而进行认真负责的批评。我们应该不断地巩固成绩、纠正缺点，逐步地把祖国建成为一个伟大的社会主义社会。
    这样就完全证明了，毛主席所说的：“我们的事业是正义的。正义的事业是任何敌人也攻不破的。”
    我相信有以毛主席为首的伟大的中国共产党正确的领导，我们的批评是可以展开的，我们的工作是可以作得更好的；我们有强大的人民解放军、人民志愿军，有广泛的人民民主统一战线，有国内各兄弟民族的一致团结，有伟大的苏联盟邦和各人民民主国家以及全世界爱好和平的人民的深厚友谊，我们的事业的成功，是有牢固的保障的，只要我们团结的更好，我们有信心粉碎美帝国主义的任何侵略阴谋。
    作为一个人民代表，我保证积极工作，同全国人民一道，为解放台湾，彻底消灭蒋介石卖国集团而奋斗。作为一个人民代表，我保证积极工作，同全国人民一道，为建设美满幸福的社会主义社会而奋斗。
    许涤新代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    周总理的政府工作报告，总结了我们国家建设的伟大成就，指明了今后的工作方针，我完全拥护。
    我国的资本主义工商业，是国家的一项重要经济因素。在一定时期内，它具有有利于国计民生的积极作用，也有不利于国计民生的消极作用。中华人民共和国成立以来，人民政府根据共同纲领的规定，对资本主义工商业采取了利用、限制和改造的政策，这就是利用资本主义工商业有利于国计民生的积极作用，限制它的不利于国计民生的消极作用，并逐步对它进行社会主义改造。对于资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造的最终目的，是要以全民所有制代替资本家所有制。根据我国的历史条件和现实条件，我们可能通过各种不同形式的国家资本主义，有步骤地实现这种改造。第一步，鼓励和指导资本主义工商业转变为各种不同形式的国家资本主义经济；第二步将国家资本主义经济改变为社会主义经济。
    国家资本主义是社会主义经济直接领导下的社会主义成分同资本主义成分在经济上的联系和合作。资本主义企业转变为国家资本主义企业后，就在不同程度上，纳入国家计划的轨道，限制了资本主义的生产无政府状态和资本家的唯利是图的破坏活动；同时，在国家资本主义的条件下，工人群众的劳动，可以逐步成为主要是为国家生产，只有较小部分是为资本家的利润而生产，因此他们的劳动热情和劳动生产率就提高了，企业内部的劳资关系就有可能得到适当的处理。这些改变，不仅有利于限制资本主义工商业的消极作用，并使国家能够充分利用其积极作用——协助国家发展生产、积累资金、供应居民需要、维持劳动就业、训练企业的技术干部和管理干部。经验证明：经过国家资本主义的不同形式，逐步完成对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，是较健全的方针和办法。
    经过几年的改造，资本主义工业的主要部分，现在已转变为各种不同形式的国家资本主义企业。资本主义工业转变为国家资本主义的趋势是：由低级形式发展到中级、高级形式；由主要行业发展到次要行业；由大城市扩展到中、小城市。几年来，国家资本主义工业无论在绝对产值上或在国民经济中的比重上，都是逐年增长的。公私合营工业的产值一九五三年较一九四九年增加到九倍多；公私合营工业占全国工业产值的比重从一九四九年的百分之二，增长至一九五三年的百分之六。国家资本主义的其他形式，特别是中级形式有着巨大的发展。据上海、天津等十二个大中城市的统计，加工、订货等的产值，如以一九五○年为一百，则一九五三年上升为三百六十四。国家资本主义的低级形式是逐步向中级形式发展的，仍以上海、天津等十二个大中城市为例，如果把低级形式的收购和中级形式的加工订货加起来作为一百，则一九五○年低级形式的收购占百分之十九点四，一九五三年已降至百分之九；同期，中级形式的加工、订货、包销则从百分之八十点六上升到百分之九十一。
    商业方面的国家资本主义，在经济恢复时期虽没有什么发展，但在国家大规模的经济建设开始以后，情况就急剧地发生了变化。因为人民购买力增长的速度日益超过日用消费品生产增长的速度，市场上许多商品出现供不应求的现象，而自由市场的存在和投机商人的兴波作浪，更增加了部分商品的供应紧张情况。为着稳定市场、保证供应，就需要将无组织的自由市场，逐步改为有组织的市场，因此，国家就扩大了工业品的加工、订货和包销的范围，并在一九五三年冬实行粮食和油料的计划收购、计划供应。最近又实行了棉花的计划收购和棉布的计划收购和计划供应。在计划收购和计划供应的情况下，社会商品流动的规律和市场关系就发生了根本性质的变化，私营商业同资本主义工业之间、私营商业同农村资本主义自发势力之间的联系，就受到了很大的限制。在国家统一掌握货源的行业中，特别在实行计划购销的行业中，私营零售商贩，一般地被纳入国家资本主义的轨道。目前，代销、经销是商业方面比较发展的国家资本主义形式。在粮食和食油实行计划购销后，粮食和食油商，已分别改为国营商业的代销店和经销店；在棉布实行计划购销之后，棉布零售商一般已经同国营商业及供销合作社建立了经销或代销的关系。此外，在其他一些行业中，还发展了批购、零销、公私联购以及公私联营等形式。
    对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，是国家在过渡时期总任务的重要组成部分，为了做好这一方面的工作，我们需要进一步注意下列一些问题：
   （一）对资本主义工业的改造，主要将经过国家资本主义的高级形式——公私合营来进行。公私合营是社会主义成分同资本主义成分在企业内部的合作，社会主义成分并居于领导地位。这种情况既便于按照社会主义企业的经营方针和管理原则来改造原有企业，也有利于对资产阶级分子的教育和改造。最近中央人民政府政务院颁布的“公私合营工业企业暂行条例”，就是根据国家在过渡时期总路线的要求和几年来公私合营企业的经验而制订的。我们必须在合营企业的干部和工业资本家中开展对于这个条例的教育和宣传，教育我们的干部做好合营企业的工作，纠正某些干部由于对公私合营企业的性质认识不清，因而在企业领导上放弃领导或忽视私股合法权益的“右”的或“左”的偏向；同时更进一步，鼓励和指导有利于国计民生的资本主义工业，有步骤地转变为公私合营工业。
    （二）中国资本主义工业是在殖民地半殖民地的条件下生长的，因为这种历史条件和资本主义生产本身的盲目性，所以，在经营管理上，在行业和地区的分配上，就产生了许多不合理的现象。例如设备的分散落后，机构的臃肿不堪，管理的腐败无能，产品规格不合客观需要，产地同销地远隔，原料同工厂远隔等等，都是明证。这些不合理的状况，是阻碍了社会主义改造的顺利开展的。我们应该鼓励私营工业，在这些方面，尽可能地进行整顿，并在自愿的原则之下，适当地进行联营合并，尽可能地减少分散落后的情况，为顺利地开展社会主义改造的工作，做好一些准备。
    （三）在国家统一掌握了某些商品的货源的条件下，对私营商业的改造，一般将逐行逐业地进行。对于这些被改造的行业的批发商和零售商都将采取适当措施。对于批发商，如果能继续经营的，就让他们继续经营，如果国营商业需要他们代理批发业务的，可以委托他们代理批发；如果可以转为零售的，就让他们转为零售；如果能够转为别的行业的，就辅导他们转业。经过上述办法仍无法安置的批发商从业人员，连同资方实职人员在内，经过训练并在服从调配、依照国营商业的工薪待遇的原则下，国营商业和合作社商业可予以分别安置。对零售商，只要它们爱国守法和服从国营商业的规定，国家将根据不同的商品种类和经营方式，采取各种形式，将它们纳入国家资本主义的轨道。商业方面，全业性转变为国家资本主义，只是改造工作的开始；如何改进他们的经营管理，如何划分供应网，如何调整某一行业过多的商店，如何对这些商业资本家、小业主进行监督教育，克服他们的违法行为并系统地进行思想改造，都是极其艰巨的工作，因此，如果认为全业性转变为国家资本主义后，问题便算解决，那是错误的。只有纠正这种错误的观点，我们才能做好对私商的改造工作。
    （四）对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造，是过渡时期特殊形式的阶级斗争。发展国家资本主义的过程，充分显示出斗争的复杂性和尖锐性。在公私合营企业中，部分资本家曾经隐瞒敌伪财产、消极怠工，有的甚至利用公私合营去进行“合公营私”。在加工、订货方面，资本家的一般做法是企业困难的时候，要求国家多加工、多订货；销路好、利润高的时候，就设法摆脱国家的加工订货；部分资本家甚至利用国家的加工、订货，进行偷工减料、挪用原料、盗窃国家资财等违法活动，去达到牟取暴利的目的。在商业的经销、代销中，掺杂掺假、短秤少称、抬价拒售、跌价竞销、盗用国家物资、挪用国家资金等违法活动，也是相当严重的。对于这些抗拒、破坏社会主义改造的恶劣行为，需要进行严肃的批评和斗争。由于国家资本主义优于资本主义的优越性日益显著，由于过渡时期总任务的宣传教育，工商业者中，对于爱国守法和接受社会主义改造，采取积极态度，并起了带头作用和桥梁作用的人，日渐增多；但仍有不少资本家抱着消极态度，其中有一些人，还在进行反抗破坏，还在继续其消极怠工、抽逃资金、变生产资料为生活资料等恶劣行为；有一些人则在进行挑拨工人同政府的关系，破坏生产设备，甚至有杀害职工等罪恶行为。我们需要向工商业者广泛深入地说明资本主义工商业必须进行社会主义改造的道理，说明人民政府改造资本主义工商业的具体政策，提高他们接受社会主义改造的积极性；而对于进行非法活动和进行反抗的资本家，则须区别不同性质、不同程度，分别予以批判教育及适当处理；对于情节严重的分子，则应依法给予惩处。
    （五）对资本主义企业的改造，需要同资产阶级分子的改造结合进行。只有这样，才能使我们的社会主义改造事业，才能使将来进一步将国家资本主义经济改变为社会主义经济的工作，得到顺利的发展。这一方面的工作，是有缺点的。在国家资本主义企业内部，对于如何改进和提高生产，是注意了的，但对于教育改造资产阶级分子的工作则往往注意不够，甚至被忽略了。而在对资产阶级的政治、思想教育方面，不少地方，又往往只注意到各个时期政治运动和社会改革，未能联系到他们在生产经营和企业改革中实践，使他们在学习中的收获能够在实践中加以巩固。今后在国家资本主义企业中，应当把企业改造同对资本家及资方代理人的教育改造，密切结合起来，帮助他们逐步学习新事物和新思想，使他们在社会主义改造事业中，正确地发挥其积极作用。
    对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造是一项复杂而艰巨的任务，在前进的道路上，无疑地还存在着许多困难；但是客观条件是有利的，只要我们不断提高政治觉悟，贯彻国家的政策，坚持谨慎小心、认真学习的态度，就一定能推动资本主义工商业的社会主义改造事业向前发展！
    黄正清代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意和拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告。
    五年来，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的领导下，我们在各项工作上都获得了伟大的成就。我们甘南藏族地区实行了区域自治，加强了各民族之间和民族内部的团结；支援和配合人民解放军剿灭了由蒋介石卖国集团直接支持的马良股匪，安定了社会秩序；发展了农、牧业生产和贸易、交通、医疗等事业；人民生活也有了初步改善。但我们工作中的缺点还是很多的。首先是对自治机关的职能发挥得不够充分，在管理本民族事务上，当家作主的积极性还不够，民族内部的某些不团结现象未能及时消除，本民族干部在工作中主动提出改进意见的还不多。其次是自治区人民政府和上级领导对民族特点调查研究不够，使自治区的有些工作计划和具体措施不够切合实际，并缺少一些适合本民族需要的单行法规。我们还觉得在某些问题上，上级领导对甘南地区工作的帮助和指导也不够适时和具体，在帮助自治机关发挥作用方面，也有些作得不够。今后我们除努力改正以上缺点并建议有关上级改进领导外，还应继续加强民族团结，提高警惕，随时打击来自敌人方面的任何破坏阴谋，防止民族间和民族内部可能发生的某些纠纷。我们认为：一切民族间和民族内部的纠纷，都是历史上反动统治阶级的民族压迫政策所造成的。只要我们本着民族平等团结的原则，任何纠纷都可以用协商的方法妥善解决的。
    我们深信：在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席领导下，我们各民族人民一定能够团结一致，遵循着宪法的规定，胜利实现社会主义建设和社会主义改造的伟大事业。
    盛丕华代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    听了周总理的报告，我深深体会到从中华人民共和国成立以来，我们国家的成就是巨大的，进步是惊人的！我们的国家区域这样广大，人口这样众多，情况这样复杂，能够在短短的五年中，完成了过去几十年、几百年所做不到的事情，这是我国历史上的奇迹。难怪我们的敌人要仇恨、要伤心。
    为什么能在这样短短的时期内，创造出这样的奇迹呢？这是很明白的，主要是由于我们有了工人阶级的政党——中国共产党的正确领导，建立了优越的人民民主制度。因此，正如刘少奇代表在关于宪法草案的报告中所说的：“国家权力一旦掌握在有组织有领导的人民手里，便能发挥无敌的力量”。
    周总理的报告中所指出的五年来的巨大成就，以上海作为例证也是十分显明的。大家知道：上海曾经长期被帝国主义与官僚买办侵占和统治，是他们利用特权来操纵、垄断、掠夺我国人民资财的基地。它在过去曾经又是流氓地痞最猖獗，社会风气最腐化的城市。但是上海在一九四九年解放以后，虽然在美帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团的封锁和骚扰之下，由于中国共产党和人民政府的正确领导，人民解放军的保卫，我们全市人民团结一致，努力进行着恢复、建设的工作，不论在经济、文化、市政等各方面，都获得了巨大的成就，建立了社会新秩序，生产不断上升，生活逐步提高。今日的上海已起了根本的变化，成为为国家建设服务、为人民生活服务的工业生产的重要城市。当然，我们绝不能满足于已有的成就，我们尚有不少的缺点需要及时改正。例如，上海人民法院几年来勤勉不懈地进行了审判工作，肯定是有成绩的，保卫了人民民主制度，维护了公共秩序；但是积案甚多未能迅速审结，经过去年突击清理，还是解决不了，甚至有些案件拖延一、二年尚未判决。这样，就会影响政府同群众的关系。又有个别的法院工作干部，对于不同成分的公民，没有依照公民在法律上一律平等的原则来进行审判，这些今后都应加以改正。
    我国通过和平的道路逐步过渡到社会主义社会，对私营工商业者来说，必须接受社会主义改造，首先就要做到爱国守法。一般私营工商业者，几年来不断地受到了教育，大多数都能真心愿意做一个切实守法者，但是税收方面还存在着若干问题，少数工商业者确有蓄意偷漏的不良行为，必须加以批评教育，严肃处理，以维法纪，确保税收。同时亦有不少工商业者未能认真学习税法，积极改进管理制度、经常进行检查，因此，补税面还是相当大，今后应该在思想上重视税收，在行动上做到依法缴税。但另一方面，我国的税法，仍是相当繁复，解释不容易，而且也常常不一致，查账标准不一，如能使税法简单明了，统一解释，统一查账标准，同时加强宣传教育，必然有利于税法的切实遵守，有利于对私营工商业的改造。
    现在我国宪法已经通过，我们一定在毛主席和中国共产党领导之下，老老实实，勤勤恳恳，互勉互助，力戒任何的虚夸和骄傲，遵守宪法，实施宪法，来保证社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的胜利完成。
    邵式平代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意和拥护周恩来总理的报告，并保证在今后工作中坚决贯彻执行报告中提出的任务。
    五年来，中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席领导着全国人民进行了巨大的工作，贯彻了共同纲领，无论内政、外交、军事、政治、经济、文化等各个方面，都获得历史性的伟大成就和胜利。这些成就和胜利，生动地证明我们国家的人民民主制度的优越性。这些成就和胜利，鼓舞着全国人民，给全国人民带来了过渡到社会主义去的坚强意志和信心。这些成就和胜利，也鼓舞着全世界人民，给世界和平民主阵营增加了力量。正如刘少奇同志在关于在宪法草案的报告中所说的：“我国已经同苏联和各人民民主国家一起，成为保卫世界和平的坚强堡垒。”
    江西是革命老根据地之一，自中国共产党和毛主席率领红军北上抗日后，这个革命老根据地的人民，曾遭受国民党匪帮反动统治毁灭性的摧残，经济大遭破坏，生产大为降落，人口大为减少。解放以来的五年中，江西的人民一直是欢欣鼓舞的。在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的英明正确领导和亲切关怀下，胜利地进行了土地改革、抗美援朝、镇压反革命分子、恢复国民经济等大规模的斗争，并自一九五三年起，在国民经济业已恢复的基础上，胜利地进行着有计划的经济建设。广大人民的物质和文化生活也有相应的改善和提高。这就使江西的社会基础起了根本的变化，为社会主义建设与社会主义改造创造了良好的开端。
    五年来，江西省的工作，固然获得很大成绩，但同时在工作中也存在着不少的缺点和某些错误。举例来说，粮食的计划收购和计划供应，是实现国家在过渡时期总任务的重要措施，是完全正确的。在粮食计划收购工作中，也努力完成了任务，并且有些超过。但在许多地方，由于掌握不够，曾发生购粮面过宽。固然还有一些富农以及被富农影响的一些富裕农民的余粮没有完全购买出来，但同时有不少的基本农民群众、乡村干部、劳动模范、积极分子，不仅是出卖了余粮，并且出卖了部分口粮。在粮食计划供应工作中，虽然保证了供应，但粮食供应面也就不能不做得更宽。这样，就产生了一部分粮食买进卖出、运来运去的现象。这对农民的劳动力是有些浪费的，对农业生产也有些影响，并增加了粮食工作上一些不必要的困难。在油料和食油的收购供应工作中，有不少的地方也引起了一些紧张现象。这是关系到广大人民日常生活的问题，我们必须加以适当解决，否则，就会影响到粮食和油料的生产，也可能影响到国家的需要。
    今年是我国第一个五年计划的第二年，江西全省人民在国家过渡时期总任务的鼓舞下，情绪是高涨的，工农业生产一般都进行得较为顺利。但自夏季以来，局部地区遭受了严重的水灾，造成重大的损失。为了弥补这次水灾所造成的损失，全省第一届人民代表大会第一次会议，特别通过了“关于开展增产节约、生产救灾运动的决议”。现在全省人民正以全力贯彻这个运动，为争取完成一九五四年工农业生产计划和各项任务而努力。
    “发扬革命传统、争取更大光荣”，毛主席这个对于革命老根据地的伟大号召，江西人民都时刻牢记住的。我们要进一步发扬革命传统，坚决遵守和执行宪法、各种法律和第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的一切决议。我们要以全力从各方面加强工作，提高警惕，加强戒备，以足够的人力、物力、财力，积极支援中国人民解放军解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团。我们要以高度的积极性和创造性，为逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，逐步完成对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，为建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会而奋斗。
    华罗庚代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    在举国欢腾地庆祝中华人民共和国宪法通过的时候，我们又听到了周恩来总理的内容丰富的政府工作报告，我们感到无比兴奋。我们能够代表全国人民在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议中，来听取和讨论包括有这么许多辉煌成就的政府工作报告，是一件值得庆幸的事情。我们谨代表人民向辛劳贤明的政府领袖们表示衷心的感谢。我建议大会通过周恩来总理所作的政府工作报告。
    周总理在报告中所提到的各方面的成就，如抗美援朝、日内瓦会议及其他争取和平的斗争、经济建设、社会改革等，我们都完全满意。这一连串的成就已经使我国的国际地位蒸蒸日上，人民政权日益巩固，人民的物质文化生活有了显著的提高。这是每一个中国人民都能亲身体会到的。特别是解放台湾是我国全民一致的愿望和要求。我们全心全力支持政府，进行解放台湾的斗争，不达到目的，决不休止。
    在讨论宪法的时候，很多代表引用了宪法第九十五条来说明我国人民民主政权对科学文学艺术的关怀，作为一个科学工作者的我当然也有深切的同感。特别是当我回想到在反动统治时期我的著作不能出版的事实，这种感觉就更亲切。
    但是说来惭愧，这五年来我们的工作成绩却远不能和我们祖国的突飞猛进的情况相适应。特别是科学工作还远不能支援生产建设上的需要，如何急起直追，是我们每一个从事科学文化工作者的责任。
    列宁曾经说过：“只有用人类创造出来的全部知识宝藏来丰富自己的头脑的时候，才能成为共产主义者。”如果我们把这句至理名言来衡量我们的工作，我们就会发现我们的工作中还存在着严重的缺点，还存在着：不从下苦功、勤学习、严格锻炼入手，不从接受和融会贯通人类知识宝库入手，而想凭聪明、耍技巧、侥幸地创造出惊人成就的思想。习仲勋副主任曾经传达过政务院文化教育委员会的“整顿巩固，重点发展，提高质量，稳步前进。”的正确方针，但是这方针还没有很好地贯彻到我们的思想中去。
    另一方面，却也存在着过分持重“不下手”的情况。群众中存在着对解放以来科学、文学、艺术工作太贫乏的感觉，也存在着对文艺作家及科学家殷切的渴望，希望他们能多做出些同国家进步相称的工作。
    这些缺点的克服当然是我们每一个科学工作者和文学艺术工作者的责任。但另一方面，我们也盼望政府适当地照顾社会活动较多的专家们用于专业的时间，使我们能有时间去学习、钻研和写作。
    毛主席屡次指示我们：“随着经济建设的高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮。”在今天特别从周总理的报告里，我们已经可以看到和感觉到经济高潮到来的征兆。我们科学工作者应当同其他从事文化工作的同志们在一起，加倍努力，来迎接文化高潮的来临。
    傅作义代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意周总理的政府工作报告，同时愿就五年来我国水利建设的成就，做一个简短的发言。
    五年来我们国家的各项建设，都有飞速的进展。水利建设，在中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，通过全国人民的努力，也获得了很大的成就。
    由于国民党反动统治时期的长期破坏，解放以后，各地人民兴修水利的要求非常迫切。但是，根据国民经济按比例发展的法则，同时有些工程在技术上也需要较长时期的准备，因此我们只能根据需要和可能，对于各大江河有步骤、有重点地，逐步进行根治；对于暂时不能根治的河流，一方面进行勘测设计，一方面整理巩固现有工程，或者适当进行整治，加强防汛来减轻灾害；同时依靠广大人民的积极性，广泛兴修农田水利，以解除局部地区的水旱灾害。
    截至今年六月，全国共做土工二十九亿多立方公尺，石工一千九百多万立方公尺，混凝土工七十七万多立方公尺。在短期内完成这样巨大的工程，是历史上前所未有的。
    一九五○年冬季开始的治淮工程，是分两个步骤进行的：第一步首先解决经常性的洪水和内涝灾害，第二步再消灭非常洪水的灾害并统筹开发水利。四年来的治淮工程还在第一步骤的范围之内。目前在防洪工程方面，已经完成五个水库和十六处湖泊洼地蓄洪工程，另外还有两个水库正在修建，三个水库尚在勘测设计之中。在洪泽湖修建了三河闸，以解除淮河洪水对苏北的威胁，自洪泽湖至黄海开辟了苏北灌溉总渠，为苏北的灌溉、航运事业建立基础，同时用作排洪辅道。此外，主要堤防曾根据不同标准分别培修。一部分支流曾进行局部疏浚，排涝工程也在分年推进之中。
    黄河和长江，都还没有进行根本的治理。目前除积极进行治本的准备工作以外，堤防质量也有提高。同时，针对一九三三年的洪水，在黄河修筑了滞洪、蓄洪工程；针对一九三一年的洪水，在长江中游的荆江段，修筑了荆江分洪工程，以减轻荆江大堤所受的威胁。
    华北的永定河修筑了官厅水库，东北的辽河，在支流浑河上开始修筑大伙房水库。此外华北的潮白河、大清河，华东的沂河、沭河，华南的珠江三角洲，都曾进行不同程度的治理。
    在土地改革胜利完成和农业生产互助合作运动逐步发展的条件下，农田水利工程也得到了广泛的发展。五年来全国共扩大灌溉面积六千一百余万亩。
    以上是我国五年水利建设的粗略轮廓。这些陆续兴建起来的工程，几年来对于减轻水旱灾害，保障农业增产和国家的工业建设，都起了一定的作用。
      今年长江、淮河流域和华北一部分地方发生了特大暴雨。长江流域的暴雨和洪水，根据记载为百年以来所未有。雨期早、雨量大、雨区广、时间长，因而洞庭湖诸水、鄱阳湖诸水、汉水和川江来水都先后相遇。洪水之大远超过有水文纪录以来的最大洪水。从宜昌到南京一千五百公里的水位都长期超过最高纪录，有的并且超过堤顶高度。淮河流域今年的洪水，超过了一九三一年和一九五○年。黄河今年八、九月间，通过京汉铁路的黄河铁桥，曾在一个月内，连续发生八千至一万五千秒公方的洪峰七次，这种长期持续的高水位，是多年未有的险象。河北地区今年也雨量很大，雨期很长，因而各河汇流以后，流入天津的西河水位也超过了一九三九年的最高水位。
      我们都还记得，洪水小于今年的一九三一年，据中国救荒史的记载，死于灾荒者达三百七十万人，即就伪赈务委员会公布的数字而言，江淮流域直接被淹死的人口亦达二十六万五千余人，病死、饿死者尚不在内。在长江流域，武汉市被淹，当时国民党反动政府的首都南京，亦被水浸；在淮河流域，洪水自豫皖平原冲决而下，蚌埠市被淹，津浦铁路交通中断，苏北运河堤防亦溃决多处，里下河区完全被淹。一九三九年天津市亦曾被淹，水深达二公尺，时间达一月以上。今年的洪水大于一九三一年和一九三九年，假如不是有中国共产党和人民政府的领导，假如不是由于毛主席英明的远见，五年来国家付出大量投资以兴修水利工程，今年可能发生的洪水灾害将是不可想像的。
    在今年同特大洪水的斗争中，我们整个国家的组织力量，表现了无比的卓越的成就。防汛的前线同战争的前线一样，做到了要什么，有什么；党政干部和群众同生死，共患难，达到了最高的团结；农村中互助合作运动的开展，大大加强了防汛和救灾的力量；同时，五年来兴修的防洪工程，配合防汛斗争，也都发生了应有的功效，有效地避免或减轻了灾害。
    比如长江的荆江大堤，是中游最险要的堤段。今年曾发生五次险恶的洪峰，在十数万防汛人员的努力抢护和荆江分洪工程的合理运用下，胜利地保障了堤防的安全。特别是八月七日宜昌水位高达五十五点七三公尺，据推算，洪峰到达沙市，水位就要超过荆江大堤的堤顶，经过荆江分洪工程超额分洪，沙市水位仍然超过最高纪录。假如没有荆江分洪工程和其他措施，则荆江大堤势必漫决，不但会造成大量人民的死亡，且将使武汉市势难坚守。
      一九三一年武汉市最高水位为二十八点二八公尺，但在水位达二十六点九四公尺时，已决口被淹，平地水深数公尺，被淹时间达四个月。今年武汉的水位，最高达二十九点七三公尺，超过过去最高水位的时间，长达五十八天。可是在武汉人民和人民解放军的防守下，百余公里的堤防，经过五期加高加固工程，水涨堤高，确保了武汉市的安全。
    长江的支流汉水，一九三一年两岸均被洪水淹没，一九三五年又续遭浩劫。今年汉水因受长江顶托，沙洋以下水位特高，却确保了汉水左岸的安全，避免了一九三一年和一九三五年的惨重灾害。
    在同异常洪水斗争中，淮河流域已完成的工程也都发挥了应有的效益。上游的四个水库，上面都曾发生二、三千秒公方的洪水，经水库拦蓄，或完全不放，或仅放出几十秒公方，各洼地蓄洪工程也都满蓄洪水。所以上游今年洪水虽比一九五○年为大，而灾害较一九五○年则减轻很多。同时上游拦蓄一部分洪水，对减低中、下游的洪水负担，也起了相当的作用。
    淮河中游凤台以上九个湖泊洼地蓄洪工程，都大量蓄水，对削减淮河干流的洪水峰起了重要的作用，在安徽人民的抢护下，基本上保障了涡河以东淮北平原的安全，津浦路交通畅通，蚌埠市、淮南市也得到了保全。刚刚完成的佛子岭水库，上游最大进流量达五千秒公方，由于水库拦蓄仅放出六百一十五秒公方。五河以下淮河干支流分流工程，防止了淮河的倒灌，并使各内河洪水得以顺利排泄。濉河、北淝河的治理，对减轻内涝灾害，也起了显著作用。
    淮河下游由于上、中游对于洪水的控制，特别是三河闸的合理操纵，及苏北灌溉总渠的辅助排洪，虽曾遭遇五至八级大风，在苏北人民的保卫下，确保了里下河区的安全，完全避免了一九三一年运堤决口的惨祸。
    黄河的防汛，现在尚未结束，今年水情虽然十分险恶，截至目前并未发生灾害。天津市在河北省、天津市及人民解放军的抢护下，避免了一九三九年的灾祸。去年完成的独流减河，曾分泄了大清河、子牙河一半的流量。官厅水库闸门关闭，永定河水不能下泄，也是获得胜利的重要因素。
    水利工作是同自然斗争的，在我们这样一个幅员广阔、河流众多、地跨寒温热三带的大国，要在短期内完全消除水旱灾害，是不可能的事情。因此今年在安徽、湖北、湖南、江西、河南、江苏及河北等省，很多地方仍然发生了严重的内涝和洪水灾害。在长江、淮河、汉水及其他河流，在洪水过大的情况下，也曾利用事前准备好的分洪区主动分洪，以避免更大的灾害。分洪区人民这种局部服从整体、小利服从大利的精神，应该受到最高的崇敬。今年的洪水大于一九三一年，但是全国受灾情况，若和一九三一年相比，则被淹范围大为缩小，受灾程度大为减轻。特别是在这样险恶的洪水情况下，由于根据水情预报，可能受灾地区的人民，都事前进行了准备或迁移，因而避免了大量的死亡，受灾群众也都进行了妥善的安置和救济，并且政府立即拨出了足够的经费，进行工程修复和生产恢复工作。我们所以获得以上成就，一方面是由于五年来治水的工程发挥了功效，而最主要的还是中国共产党和人民政府坚强的领导，全国各方面及时的支援，特别是人民解放军的大力支援，使受灾地区的人民都亲切地感觉到，我们是全国人民作为一个有组织的整体，同洪水进行斗争，在自己的背后有中国共产党，有全国六亿人民，有太阳一样的毛主席的关切；而不是像过去一样，处于分散、被动、孤立无援的状态。因而人人能够面对巨大的自然威胁，屹立不摇，英勇奋斗，战胜自然所给予我们的损害。
    经过今年洪水的考验，也暴露出我们在规划设计、施工、管理及防汛工作等方面的不少缺点。比如有些工程采用的设计洪水标准偏低；有个别建筑物发见局部损坏，未能发挥效益；也有些堤段发生不应有的决口的情况。除我们继续进行检查改进外，并盼各位代表多予批评指正。
    总之，在今年特大洪水的情况下，虽然各地党政领导和沿河人民的防汛斗争，是尽了人力所能做到的最大努力，多数工程也都发生了效用；但是仍然有许多地方发生了严重灾害。作为水利工作的负责人员，我们的心情是沉重的。让我在这里，对各地参加防汛的英雄人民和人民解放军，表示敬意，对领导和支援防汛的有关机关和全体干部，表示敬意，特别是对受灾地区的人民，表示深切的关怀。
    曹荻秋代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意和拥护周总理的报告。
    四年多以来，重庆市的工作在中共中央和中央人民政府的领导下，经过了各项社会民主改革、恢复与发展生产等一系列的工作，已把这座旧的、被蒋介石卖国集团破坏得十分凋敝的山城变得日益繁荣起来，并为进一步把它改造成为社会主义城市准备了条件。几年来的变化是巨大的，最显明的是：工业比重加大了，社会主义性质的经济迅速增长了。以一九五三年同一九五○年比较，工业生产总值增长了一点八倍，其中，国营工业的比重增长最快，已从百分之二十二点三一增长至百分之四十二点三九；商业的总营业额增长了一倍，其中国营和合作社商业的比重已从百分之十四增长至百分之六十九点三四。这说明社会主义的经济已确实成为整个国民经济的领导力量。同时，资本主义工商业正以各种不同的形式被纳入国家资本主义轨道；手工业正在走上合作化的道路。这就使这座城市在社会主义改造过程中增加了更多的社会主义因素。
    随着国家经济建设的发展，人民的教育事业也相应地发展了，学校教学的质量已有所提高，学生的学习成绩已在不断地上升。人民的物质生活和文化生活已日益改善并增加着新的内容，人们的思想意识已起了很大的变化，一种新的道德风尚正在形成，并已逐渐成为影响人们行为的社会力量。
    这些，都充分说明了中央所规定的方针、政策的正确，指导的及时，使我们能够胜利地改变旧的一切，并胜利地进行伟大的社会主义建设工程。社会主义美好的远景，已呈现在我们眼前，我们感到异常的兴奋。
    但是我们在执行国家各项任务中，是有许多缺点的。主要是：完成国家工业生产计划不均衡、不全面、前松后紧、加班加点的现象尚未完全克服；国营商业的商品流转计划和工业部门的生产计划未能很好地衔接，以致供销不能平衡，而国营商业部门对人民的需要研究不够，对市场情况变化的掌握也不够及时，以致在安排市场及对某些商品供应上有时发生失调现象；对资本主义工商业和手工业的社会主义改造还嫌做得缓慢了些；学校教学的质量还不能完全满足国家要求；卫生工作为工业为生产服务的方针尚未能完全贯彻；公安、司法工作对某些破坏国家经济建设的活动及违法行为还惩处不力，处理不及时。
    造成这些缺点的原因，是由于我们对中央的指示、决定研究不够，执行机械，工作不深入。但我们同时感到中央有些部门对下情了解不够，以致在工作的指导上有不尽合乎实际的地方。例如在提高厂矿企业管理水平的指导上有些一般化，对某些厂矿的特殊情况照顾不够，因而使工作走了弯路。另一种情况是对某些工作的要求不恰当，例如劳动就业、扫除文盲和小学五年一贯制、医院盲目增加床位等，都有过高过急的缺点。
    为了保证完成国家在过渡时期的总任务，贯彻执行周总理报告中所提出的方针和任务，我们将加倍努力，发扬成绩，克服缺点，继续向伟大的社会主义社会前进。
