    Pu Zhongzhi, a representative to the National People's Congress, is an ordinary working farmer. Before liberation, his entire family of six, including his wife and children, relied on only one mu of meager land. They were constantly underfed and poorly clothed. After liberation, this person who had endured immense suffering grew from an ordinary farmer into a Communist Party member, a model worker, and a representative to the National People's Congress under the cultivation of the Communist Party and with the support of the masses. He transformed from someone who only managed the affairs of his own family of six into a standard-bearer leading the farmers of Wang Mang Village and the surrounding villages on the path of collectivization. In just five years after liberation, Wang Mang Village in Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, transformed from an impoverished village into a cooperative new socialist village jointly marching towards a prosperous life.

    The First Step of Organizing

    Wang Mang Village was liberated in May 1949. That winter, based on the recommendations of the rent reduction and interest rate reduction work team, Pu Zhongzhi organized a mutual aid team of twenty-eight people. At that time, the snow was half an inch thick, and everyone's enthusiasm for production was high. They got up before dawn to haul manure. However, after only a month, when they calculated the accounts, everyone felt they had recorded too few work points for themselves. They argued and quarreled, making it impossible to proceed. In the end, Pu Zhongzhi and several cadres made up the shortfall in wages. The large mutual aid team collapsed.

    The failure of this large mutual aid team deeply hurt Pu Zhongzhi, but he did not lose heart. He thought, "Organizing is Chairman Mao's call. The mistake must be in our methods."

    In February 1951, Pu Zhongzhi learned from the lessons of the large mutual aid team and, drawing on the experience of organizing in the old liberated areas of northern Shaanxi, led the farmers in the village to establish fourteen mutual aid groups. After they were established, Pu Zhongzhi convened meetings with the cadres every night to discuss how to calculate work points and accounts, how to arrange the order of tasks... All the mutual aid groups were consolidated. That autumn, the average yield of various crops in the village's mutual aid groups was 63.9 percent higher than when farming individually in 1950, and they received an award from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government.

    The vivid fact that organizing had led to more grain production strongly attracted individual farmers. Many individual farmers requested to be organized. By February 1952, there were twenty-five mutual aid groups in the village. Households that had been organized accounted for 94 percent of the village's households. Although there were uneven distributions of drought and flood that year, the yields of rice and wheat were no lower than in 1951.

    A Step Forward

    In the winter of 1952, the Chang'an County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Shaanxi Province, in order to enable the farmers of Wang Mang Village to clearly see their development prospects, sent a work team to the village to help formulate a three-year construction plan. In the process of formulating the plan, Pu Zhongzhi and other leading core members further realized that mutual aid groups, when developed to a certain stage, must be transformed into agricultural production cooperatives in order to further increase production. Therefore, they requested to transform the mutual aid group directly led by him into an agricultural production cooperative. The county party committee agreed to their request and sent cadres to help them solve various specific problems. Thus, the Pu Zhongzhi Agricultural Production Cooperative, consisting of fourteen households, was officially established at the end of 1952. After the cooperative was established, it demonstrated great superiority in production. Not only was the order of tasks solved, but small livestock were replaced with large livestock, ten-inch plows were used for deep plowing, improved varieties were used, labor was uniformly allocated by the cooperative, labor was extracted to specialize in milling sideline production, and fat pigs were raised to expand fertilizer sources. The first season of crops (wheat) after the transformation of the cooperative achieved a bumper harvest, averaging 560 jin per mu, 33 percent higher than the output of the village's mutual aid groups and 90 percent higher than individual farmers. Autumn rice field operations were also more meticulous than the mutual aid groups, and rice also achieved a bumper harvest, with an average yield of 675 jin per mu, higher than the output of the village's mutual aid groups.

    The Village Was Basically Cooperativized

    In 1953, Wang Mang Village achieved another bumper harvest of summer and autumn crops. After the bumper harvest, some people started making small calculations again. After the summer pre-distribution of the agricultural production cooperative, Ye Lingwa, the poorest member in the cooperative, not only paid off his debts and gave the cooperative 600,000 yuan as investment in livestock, but also ate wheat and still couldn't finish it by the time the rice came in. However, soon, this young man who came to Wang Mang Village from the north bank of the Wei River by begging for food, had a change in his thinking. When going to the rice fields to collect grass, he pretended to have a stomach ache and rested at home. When others called him, he said, "Joining the cooperative or not is a trivial matter!" Now, he also felt that the agricultural production cooperative was restricting his development. He and his wife only had four mu of land, and they were going to have a child, so he thought the land was too little and wanted to "withdraw from the cooperative and buy more land." At this time, two middle peasant households in the village wanted to withdraw from the mutual aid group and compete with the agricultural production cooperative in output; two mutual aid groups in the village were about to break up. After the autumn harvest, the spontaneous forces further developed. Ye Zhenxian, a middle peasant who was half-hearted when he joined the cooperative, saw that the cooperative had enriched his land and that he could grow a good crop next year, also used the excuse that the cooperative had distributed too little to him (in fact, it was not little, and his net income had increased by more than 300 jin of fine grain compared to before joining the cooperative) and withdrew from the cooperative, wanting to get rich on his own. Under the influence of his withdrawal, one or two middle peasant households in the cooperative were also hesitant. These spontaneous forces made Pu Zhongzhi, a long-tempered Communist Party member, feel overwhelmed.

    At a time when the struggle between the two roads in the countryside was becoming increasingly clear and sharp, the propaganda of the general line began, and the planned purchase of grain also began. Pu Zhongzhi was extremely excited when the work team for the propaganda of the general line arrived in the village. He was so excited that he couldn't sleep for several nights. He told people, "Chairman Mao lives in Beijing, how did he figure out the situation in our countryside so clearly? Now there's a solution!" After the propaganda of the general line in Wang Mang Village, the socialist spirit was greatly uplifted again. In just over a month, the entire village set off a high tide of joining the cooperative. The agricultural production cooperative led by Pu Zhongzhi expanded to sixty-five households, and three new cooperatives were also established. A total of one hundred and thirty-five households in the village joined the agricultural production cooperatives, accounting for 84 percent of the total number of households in the village. More than 90 percent of the households in the village had joined the supply and marketing cooperative and the credit cooperative. The entire village had basically been cooperativized.

    Transformed into a New Type of Village

    Wang Mang Village used to be a poor village. In the old society, more than 75 percent of the families lacked food and clothing; 25 percent of the families lacked grain for the whole year; many people could not wear cotton clothes even in the cold winter months. Zhao Jingtang's mother, a cooperative member, had fantasized before liberation that it would be good if she could drink a bowl of "rice soup that doesn't make a sound in the throat" (thick rice porridge). Now, the lives of the entire village have changed greatly. Taking Zhao Jingtang's family as an example, his family had already exceeded the living standards of drinking thick rice porridge and ate rice and steamed buns almost every day; the entire family of five, large and small, all put on new cloth-faced cotton-padded jackets in the winter of 1952.

    The most commendable thing is that under the correct leadership of the Party, the farmers of Wang Mang Village helped each other through mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and after the land reform, no family sold land. There was no class differentiation in the entire village. Eighty percent of the poor peasants at the time of the land reform have risen to become middle peasants. At present, middle peasants (including new middle peasants who have risen from poor peasants after the land reform) account for 83.75 percent of the total number of peasant households in the village.

    With the rise in economic life, the cultural life of the farmers of Wang Mang Village is also developing rapidly. Although there was a primary school in the village before liberation, only about thirty children attended school. By last autumn, all school-age children in the village were attending school. Poor farmers who had no opportunity to learn culture in the old society have been able to recognize thousands of characters with the help of the people's schools in the past few years. Leading cadres such as Pu Zhongzhi and Wang Guilan (women), who were illiterate in the past, can now read popular books and newspapers. The superstitious phenomena of worshiping gods and ghosts that were left over from the old days have also gradually been eliminated.

    In the process of constantly overcoming the spontaneous forces of rural capitalism, Wang Mang Village has become a new type of village that is prosperous, happy, and has a new culture.

    王莽村变成了一个合作化的新农村
    文华　陈泰志
    全国人民代表大会代表蒲忠智是一个平凡的劳动农民。解放前，他全家婆娘娃娃六口人，只守着
  一亩薄地。一年到头都是吃不饱、穿不暖。这个饱经苦难的人，在解放后，在共产党的培养下，在群众的支持下，从一个普通的农民成长为共产党员、劳动模范、全国人民代表大会代表；从一个过去只管自己六口之家的家务的人，成长为领导王莽村全村农民和周围的许多村子的农民走合作化道路的旗手。解放后不过五年，陕西省长安县的王莽村，就由一个贫苦的村庄变成了一个共同走向富裕生活的合作化的新农村了。
    组织起来的第一步
    王莽村是在一九四九年五月解放的。这年冬天，蒲忠智根据减租减息工作组的意见，组织起了一个二十八人的变工队。那时雪下的足有半寸厚，大家的生产劲头很高，天微明就起来拉粪。可是，不到一月光景，算了一下账，都嫌给自己记的工少了。你争我吵，没法下场。最后，短了的工资还是由蒲忠智和几个干部垫赔了事。大变工队也就垮台了。
    这次大变工队的失败，伤透了蒲忠智的心，可是他并没有灰心。他这样想：“组织起来是毛主席的号召，错准是错在咱的办法上。”
    一九五一年二月，蒲忠智接受了大变工队的教训，参照陕北老区组织起来的经验，领导村里的农民成立起十四个互助组。成立起来后，蒲忠智每晚召集干部在一块开会，研究怎样计工算账，怎样安排活路的先后，……所有的互助组都巩固下来了。这年秋天，全村互助组各样庄稼的平均产量比一九五零年单干时高百分之六十三点九，获得了中央人民政府农业部的奖励。
    组织起来多打了粮食的生动事实，强烈地吸引了单干农民。许多单干农民都要求组织起来。到一九五二年二月，全村已有二十五个互助组。组织起来的农户占全村农户百分之九十四。这年，虽然旱涝不均，但水稻及小麦的产量都不低于一九五一年。
    再前进一步
    一九五二年冬天，中共陕西省长安县委为了使王莽村农民明确地看到自己的发展前途，就派了工作组到村子里帮助订立三年建设计划。在订计划过程中，蒲忠智等领导骨干进一步认识了：互助组发展到一定阶段，就要转为农业生产合作社，才能更多增加生产，于是要求把他直接领导的那个互助组转为农业生产合作社。县委同意了他们的要求，并派干部帮助他们解决了各项具体问题。从此，十四户的蒲忠智农业生产合作社便在一九五二年年底正式成立了。社成立后，在生产上显示出了很大的优越性。不只做活先后问题解决了，而且把小牲口换成了大牲口，使用十吋步犁深耕；换用良种；劳力由社统一调配，抽出劳力专门搞磨粉副业生产；养下肥猪，扩大了肥源。转社后的第一季庄稼（小麦）就获得丰收，平均每亩收了五百六十斤，高出全村互助组产量百分之三十三；高出单干农民百分之九十。秋季稻田作务也比互助组细致，水稻也获得丰收，每亩平均产量达到六百七十五斤，高出全村互助组的产量。
    全村基本上合作化了
    一九五三年，王莽村的夏、秋两季庄稼又获得了丰收。丰收之后，有些人又打起小算盘来了。农业生产合作社夏季预分后，社里最穷的叶灵娃不仅还清了欠债，交给社六十万元的牲口投资，而且净吃小麦，到稻子上场时还吃不完。可是不久，这个从渭河北岸讨口叫化来到王莽村的年青人，思想上就起了变化。下稻田捞草的时候，他在家里装肚痛歇凉。别人叫他，他却说：“入社不入社淡事！”现在，他也嫌农业生产合作社束缚他的发展了。他小两口只分得四亩地，还要生孩子，他认为地太少了，要“出社多买几亩地再说”。就在这个时候，村里有两户中农要退出互助组，和农业生产合作社比赛产量；村里有两个互助组要散伙了。秋收结束后，自发势力更发展了，原来入社时就是三心二意的中农叶振贤，看到社里把他的地上壮了，来年可以长一季好庄稼，也借口社里给他分的少（事实上并不少，净收入比入社前增加细粮三百多斤），退社想个人发财去。在他退社的影响下，社里还有一、两户中农也犹豫不定了。这些自发势力，使这位久经锻炼的共产党员蒲忠智也感到难以招架了。
    在农村两条道路的斗争日趋明显和尖锐的时候，总路线的宣传开始了，粮食计划收购也开始了。宣传总路线工作组一到村，蒲忠智兴奋万分，他兴奋得好几个夜睡不着觉。他对人讲：“毛主席住在北京，咋把咱农村的情况摸得这样清，这下子有办法了！”王莽村在总路线宣传后，社会主义正气又大大抬头了，在短短的一个多月内，全村掀起了入社的高潮。蒲忠智领导的农业生产合作社扩大为六十五户，另外还成立了三个新社。全村加入农业生产合作社的农民共有一百三十五户，占全村总农户百分之八十四。全村已有百分之九十以上的农户加入了供销合作社和信用合作社。全村已经基本上合作化了。
    变成了一个新型的农村
    王莽村原来是个穷村子。在旧社会里，有百分之七十五以上的人家都缺衣少吃；有百分之二十五的人家全年缺口粮；有不少人到风雪交加的数九寒天也穿不上棉衣。社员赵景堂的母亲在解放前曾幻想啥时能喝一顿“喉咙不响的米汤”（稠米饭）也就好了。如今，全村的日子大变了。就以赵景堂家为例，他家里早已超过喝稠米汤的生活水平了，几乎每天都吃大米饭和馍馍；全家大小五口人，在一九五二年冬天就都穿上新布面棉袄了。
    最难能可贵的是：王莽村农民在党的正确领导下，通过互助合作组织互相帮助，土地改革以后，没有一家出卖土地。全村没有出现阶级分化的现象。土地改革时的贫农，已有百分之八十上升为中农了。目前，中农（包括土改后由贫农上升的新中农）已占全村农民总户数百分之八十三点七五。
    随着经济生活的上升，王莽村农民的文化生活也在迅速地向前发展。村里在解放前虽有一所小学，但只有三十来个娃娃上学。到去年秋天，全村所有的学龄儿童都上学了。过去在旧社会里无机会学文化的贫困农民，解放几年来在民校的帮助下，有的已能认识上千字了。蒲忠智、王桂兰（妇女）等领导干部，过去都是一字不识，现在能读通俗书报了。旧时遗留下来的敬神敬鬼一类的愚昧现象，也逐渐消除了。
    在不断克服农村资本主义自发势力的过程中，王莽村已经成为一个富裕、幸福而且具有新文化的新型农村。
