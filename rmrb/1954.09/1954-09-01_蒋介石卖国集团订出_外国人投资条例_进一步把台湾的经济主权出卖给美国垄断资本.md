    Xinhua News Agency, 29th. Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous clique passed a "Foreign Investment Regulations" on July 6th. The Chiang gang's passage of this regulation is an attempt to further offer Taiwan's economic sovereignty to his American masters, in exchange for the protection of the American aggressor group.
    In this regulation, the Chiang bandits obliterated the restrictions on foreign investment in the previously enacted "Company Law," "Mining Law," "Land Law," "Maritime Law," and "Civil Aviation Law." In Article 18 of this traitorous regulation, in order to enable American monopoly capital to plunder Taiwan's rich mineral deposits as much as possible, the Chiang bandits abolished the original provisions of the pseudo-"Mining Law" that more than half of the shares of mining companies should be owned by Chinese, more than half of the company's directors should be Chinese, and the positions of chairman and general manager of the company should be held by Chinese, as well as the restrictions in the pseudo-"Land Law" that mining land should not be leased to foreigners, all were abolished. In order to facilitate American monopoly capital's monopoly of Taiwan's navigation rights, the Chiang bandits abolished the restrictions in the pseudo-"Maritime Law" that the shareholders of unlimited liability shipping companies should all be Chinese, more than two-thirds of the directors of limited liability shipping companies should be Chinese, and more than two-thirds of their capital should be owned by Chinese, all were abolished. In order to facilitate American monopoly capital's control of Taiwan's aviation rights, the Chiang bandits completely abolished the restrictions in the pseudo-"Civil Aviation Law" that the majority of shareholders, directors, and supervisors of civil aviation companies should be Chinese, and more than 51% of the total shares should be owned by Chinese. The Chiang bandits also abolished the restrictions in the pseudo-"Company Law" that some of the company's shareholders, promoters, directors, and supervisors must have residences in Taiwan and that the chairman must be Chinese.
    The Chiang bandits also gave American monopoly capital every convenience in terms of investment types and methods. Article 3 of the Chiang bandits' traitorous regulations stipulates that foreigners may use foreign currency or cash composed of foreign exchange, imported machinery or other materials, specialized technology or patent rights, net profits and interest on investment principal settled in foreign exchange, or income from other countries as types of investment. Article 4 stipulates that the methods of investment include foreigners "investing alone or jointly" to "establish businesses or increase capital to expand existing businesses," or "jointly investing" with Chiang bandits' bureaucratic capital; foreigners "purchasing shares or corporate bonds of existing businesses, or borrowing cash, machinery or other materials"; and "providing specialized technology or patent rights" to "cooperate in business" with Chiang bandits' bureaucratic capital. According to Articles 5 and 7 of the Chiang bandits' traitorous regulations, the scope of foreign investment includes "important industries," "public utilities," "those related to national defense," "monopolistic enterprises," and all other industrial and commercial enterprises.
    This naked regulation of selling out economic sovereignty has opened the door for the further intrusion of American monopoly capital forces into Taiwan. With the help of this traitorous regulation, American monopoly capital can monopolize Taiwan's mining rights, navigation rights, and aviation rights, and control all of Taiwan's industrial and commercial enterprises.
    Not only that, but the Chiang bandit gang has also drafted an "Income Tax Law Amendment," the spirit of which is to "specially favor" "newly established enterprises" set up by American capital in Taiwan, "exempting them from part or all of their income tax."
    Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous behavior has satisfied his American masters. Officials from the US Foreign Operations Administration's Taiwan branch believe that the Chiang bandits' traitorous regulations have created a "good environment for US investment in Taiwan." Steffen, the head of the "American Economic Advisory Group" who arrived in Taiwan on August 10, also said when discussing this traitorous regulation: "If investment in Taiwan can obtain benefits superior to investment in other regions, American capital will naturally come." At present, the "American Economic Advisory Group" is conducting major activities in Taiwan, and the Chiang bandits are also trying their best to collect Taiwan's economic data and provide it to his American masters for reference; many Americans are surveying Taiwan's forestry and mineral resources; these activities are obviously preparing for American monopoly capital to plunder Taiwan's rich resources in accordance with the Chiang bandits' traitorous regulations.
    Chiang bandits' "China Economic" monthly admitted that the "major political significance" of Chiang's enactment of this traitorous "Foreign Investment Regulations" lies in promoting American monopoly capital to "establish economic interests" more widely and deeply in Taiwan, in order to "influence the United States' policy toward China" and make it "not undergo drastic changes with changes in the international situation."

### 蒋介石卖国集团订出“外国人投资条例”  进一步把台湾的经济主权出卖给美国垄断资本

    蒋介石卖国集团订出“外国人投资条例”
    进一步把台湾的经济主权出卖给美国垄断资本
      【新华社二十九日讯】蒋介石卖国集团在七月六日通过了一个“外国人投资条例”。蒋匪通过这个条例，是想把台湾经济主权进一步奉献给他的美国主子，以换取美国侵略集团对蒋匪的庇护。
    在这一条例中，蒋匪把过去所订的“公司法”、“矿业法”、“土地法”、“海商法”、“民用航空法”中有关对外国人投资的限制一笔勾销。在这一卖国条例的第十八条中，为了使美国垄断资本能尽量掠夺台湾丰富的矿藏，蒋匪把伪“矿业法”原来规定的矿业公司股份过半数应为中国人所有，公司董事过半数应为中国人，公司董事长及总经理等职应由中国人充任的限制，以及伪“土地法”中关于矿地不得租赁给外国人的限制，全部废除。为了便利美国垄断资本独占台湾的航海权，蒋匪把伪“海商法”中规定的无限责任航业公司的股东应全部为中国人，有限责任航业公司的董事三分之二以上应为中国人及其资本三分之二以上应为中国人所有等限制，全部废除。为了便利美国垄断资本控制台湾的航空权，蒋匪把伪“民用航空法”中规定的民航公司股东、董事、监事应多数为中国人，股票总额百分之五十一以上应为中国人所有等等限制，完全废除。蒋匪还废弃了伪“公司法”规定的公司的股东、发起人、董事、监察人须有一部分在台湾有住所及董事长须为中国人的限制。
    蒋匪并在投资种类和投资方式上给美国垄断资本以一切便利。蒋匪卖国条例第三条规定，外国人可用外国货币或外汇构成的现金、输入机器或其他物资、专门技术或专利权、经结付外汇的投资本金净利孳息或他国收益等为出资种类。第四条规定，投资的方式有外国人“单独或联合出资”来“举办事业或增加资本扩展原有事业”，或与蒋匪官僚资本“共同出资”经营；外国人“对于原有事业之股份或公司债之购买，或为现金机器或其他物资之借贷”；还有“供给专门技术或专利权”与蒋匪官僚资本“合作经营”。按照蒋匪卖国条例第五、第七条的规定，外国人投资的范围包括“重要工业”、“公用事业”、“与国防有关者”、“独占性企业”以及其他一切工商业。
    蒋匪这一赤裸裸的出卖经济主权的条例，为美国垄断资本势力的进一步侵入台湾打开了大门。美国垄断资本借助于这个卖国条例，就可以独占台湾的开矿权、航海权、航空权，并控制台湾的一切工商业。
    不但如此，蒋匪帮还拟订了一个“所得税法修正案”，其精神在于“特别优待”美国资本在台湾设立的“新兴企业”，“免其征缴所得税一部或全部”。
    蒋匪这种卖国行为使他的美国主子感到满意。美国援外事务管理署驻台湾分署官员认为，蒋匪卖国条例已造成美国“在台投资的良好环境”。八月十日到达台湾的“美国经济顾问团”团长斯特芬在谈论这个卖国条例时也表示：如果到台湾“投资可以得到优于其他地区投资的利益，美国资本自然会来的”。目前，“美国经济顾问团”正在台湾大事活动，蒋匪也正在尽量搜集台湾经济资料提供给他的美国主子参考；许多美国人正在勘察台湾的林业和矿业资源；这些活动显然都是为美国垄断资本根据蒋匪卖国条例来劫掠台湾富源作准备。
    蒋匪“中国经济”月刊承认，蒋贼订立这个卖国的“外国人投资条例”的“重大的政治意义”在于促使美国垄断资本在台湾更广泛、更根深蒂固地“建立经济利益”，以便“影响美国对华政策”，使其“不会随着国际情形变化而有所剧变”。
