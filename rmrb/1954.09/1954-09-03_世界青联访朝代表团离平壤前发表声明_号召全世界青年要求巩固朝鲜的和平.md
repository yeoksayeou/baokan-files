Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 2nd. The seven-member delegation of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, after a 15-day visit to various parts of North Korea, left Pyongyang by plane on August 30th.

During its stay in Korea, the delegation visited many places, including Pyongyang, Wonsan, and Kaesong, and held separate forums with youth from all walks of life in Korea, as well as bacteriologists and epidemic prevention personnel.

Before leaving Pyongyang, the delegation held a press conference and issued a statement on its visit to Korea.

The statement said: We have seen the inhuman atrocities of the American armed aggressors in Korea, and we are shocked, hateful, and angry. Everywhere we see unprecedented and appalling destruction, which once again confirms the atrocities of the American aggressors in Korea and their crimes of conducting germ warfare.

The statement also said: We visited the Korean Military Armistice Commission and confirmed that the U.S. side has continuously violated the armistice agreement, transported military personnel and a large number of weapons into South Korea, and frequently crossed the demarcation line with aircraft and armed personnel to carry out provocations. This clearly proves that the U.S. side does not want peace in Korea but is more enthusiastic about launching wars to slaughter people.

The statement said that acts that undermine the armistice agreement are threatening peace, and the delegation called on youth around the world to demand compliance with the provisions of the armistice agreement and the consolidation of peace in Korea.

The statement described the collective heroism of the Korean people and youth who won victory in the anti-aggression war and the brilliant achievements they have made in post-war reconstruction. The statement also called on peace-loving youth around the world to unite, strengthen vigilance, and not allow the crimes committed by the aggressors in Korea to happen again.

The statement said: Relevant countries and peace-loving people around the world should continue to work hard to make the armistice a consolidated peace and to resolve the Korean issue peacefully.

The statement finally called on youth around the world to support and assist Korean youth in their post-war peaceful construction and struggle for the happiness, peace, and bright future of the younger generation, to further strengthen the unity of peace-loving youth, to improve international relations and consolidate peace and security among the people of all countries on the basis of peaceful coexistence between countries with different political and economic systems.

    世界青联访朝代表团离平壤前发表声明
    号召全世界青年要求巩固朝鲜的和平
     【新华社平壤二日电】到朝鲜访问的世界民主青年联盟代表团一行七人在朝鲜北部各地参观访问了十五天以后，已于八月三十日乘飞机离开平壤。
    代表团在朝鲜期间，先后访问了平壤、元山、开城等许多地方，和朝鲜各界青年以及细菌学者和卫生防疫人员等分别举行过座谈会。
    代表团在离平壤前，举行了记者招待会，就访问朝鲜发表了声明。
    声明说：我们看到了美国武装侵略者在朝鲜的惨无人道的暴行，感到惊异、痛恨和愤怒。我们到处看到史无前例的惊人的破坏，又一次证实了美国侵略者在朝鲜的暴行和进行细菌战的罪行。
    声明又说：我们访问了朝鲜军事停战委员会，证实了美方曾不断地违反停战协定，把军事人员和大量武器运进南朝鲜，又经常以飞机和武装人员越过分界线进行挑衅。这清楚地证明了美方不想使朝鲜得到和平而是更热中于发动战争来屠杀人民。
    声明说，破坏停战协定的行为正威胁着和平，代表团号召全世界青年要求遵守停战协定的规定和巩固朝鲜的和平。
    声明叙述了在反侵略战争中获得胜利的朝鲜人民和青年的集体英雄主义精神和他们在战后恢复建设工作中取得的光辉成就。声明并要求全世界爱好和平的青年团结起来，加强警惕，不让侵略者在朝鲜所制造的罪行再次发生。
    声明说：有关国家和全世界爱好和平的人民应继续努力，使停战成为巩固的和平，以和平办法解决朝鲜问题。
    声明最后号召全世界青年支持和援助朝鲜青年进行战后的和平建设和争取年轻一代的幸福、和平和光明前途的斗争，进一步加强爱好和平的青年的团结，在政治和经济制度互不相同的国家和平共处的基础上，改善国际间的关系并巩固各国人民间的和平和安全。
