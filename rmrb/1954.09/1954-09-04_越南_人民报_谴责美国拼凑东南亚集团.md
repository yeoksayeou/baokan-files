Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, September 3rd: The Vietnamese Labor Party's official newspaper, "People's Daily," published an editorial in its latest issue condemning the United States' plot to organize a Southeast Asian aggressive bloc. The editorial stated: Since the signing of the Indochina armistice agreement, American imperialism has been actively pursuing its conspiracy to organize a Southeast Asian military bloc, attempting to undermine the implementation of the armistice agreement and transform Southeast Asian countries into American military bases in preparation for a new war.

Recently, the American ruling clique has been spreading the argument that Cambodia and Laos can participate in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization without violating the Geneva Accords. Agence France-Presse has also clamored that Cambodia and Laos can participate in the Southeast Asia Defense Treaty if the treaty's provisions do not conflict with the United Nations Charter.

The editorial pointed out that at the Geneva Conference, representatives of the Kingdom of Laos and the Kingdom of Cambodia stated that their countries would never participate in any aggressive bloc, nor would they allow their countries' territories to be used to serve aggressive policies. The final declaration of the Geneva Conference also noted these statements. Regarding the implementation of the Vietnam armistice agreement, the final declaration also stipulated: Both sides should ensure that the areas assigned to them do not participate in any military alliance and are not used to resume hostilities or serve aggressive policies.

The American conspiracy to establish a Southeast Asian military bloc runs counter to the peaceful aspirations of the people of Southeast Asia and other regions of the world, as well as the spirit of the Indochina armistice agreement. The purpose of this conspiracy is to undermine the armistice agreement and the collective cooperation of the countries participating in the Geneva Conference on the Indochina issue. Zhou Enlai, Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, has stated: If certain relevant countries participate in this divisive action of the American aggressive bloc, it will endanger the common work of ensuring the restoration of peace in Indochina and may undermine the implementation of the Indochina armistice agreement.

The American imperialists' plot to establish the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization shows that the American ruling clique is shamelessly undermining the United Nations Charter, which stipulates respect for the right of self-determination of all peoples and the maintenance of international cooperation and international peace and security. However, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, aims to deprive the people of all countries of their sovereignty and turn the countries participating in the organization into American satellite states and strategic bases to serve the aggressive policies of American imperialism. Precisely because of this, Southeast Asian countries such as India, Burma, Indonesia, and Ceylon have refused to participate in the Southeast Asian bloc.

The Vietnamese people resolutely protest the American imperialists' conspiracy to establish a Southeast Asian military bloc and are determined to consolidate peace in Indochina, achieve national unification through general elections, and strive to achieve independence and democracy throughout the country.

The Vietnamese people pledge to further strengthen their solidarity with the people of Cambodia and Laos, the people of Asia and France, and peace-loving people all over the world, and resolutely fight to stop the American imperialists' adventurous policies and defend peace in Southeast Asia and the world.

    越南“人民报”谴责美国拼凑东南亚集团
    【新华社三日讯】据越南通讯社北越二日讯：越南劳动党机关报“人民报”在最近一期发表社论，谴责美国组织东南亚侵略集团的阴谋。社论说：自从印度支那停战协定签订以来，美帝国主义者就一直积极地进行他们组织东南亚军事集团的阴谋，企图破坏停战协定的实施，变东南亚国家为美国军事基地，准备新战争。
    最近美国统治集团散播一种论调说，柬埔寨和老挝可以参加东南亚公约组织而不会违反日内瓦协定。法新社也叫嚷说，柬埔寨和老挝可以参加东南亚防御条约，如果这个条约的条款并不和联合国宪章相抵触的话。
    社论指出，在日内瓦会议上，老挝王国和柬埔寨王国的代表表示他们国家决不参加任何侵略集团，也不允许他们国家的领土被利用来为侵略政策服务。日内瓦会议最后宣言也注意到了这些声明。关于越南停战协定的实施问题，最后宣言中也已经规定：双方应注意，务使划归他们的地区不参加任何军事同盟，并不被用来恢复敌对行动或服务于侵略政策。
    美国建立东南亚军事集团的阴谋，是和东南亚和世界其他地区各国人民的和平愿望以及和印度支那停战协定的精神背道而驰的。这个阴谋的目的是要破坏停战协定和参加日内瓦会议的各国在印度支那问题上的集体合作。中华人民共和国总理兼外交部部长周恩来曾经声明：如果某些有关国家竟参加美国侵略集团的这个分裂行动，这就将使保证恢复印度支那和平的共同工作遭受危害，并将使印度支那停战协定的实施有被破坏的可能。
    美帝国主义者建立东南亚公约组织的阴谋表明，美国统治集团正在无耻地破坏联合国宪章，联合国宪章规定尊重各国人民的自决权利，维护国际合作和国际和平及安全。但是，东南亚公约组织和北大西洋公约组织一样，目的是要剥夺各国人民的主权，把参加组织的国家变为美国的卫星国和战略基地，为美帝国主义者的侵略政策服务。正因为这样，印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚和锡兰等东南亚国家已拒绝参加东南亚集团。
    越南人民坚决抗议美帝国主义者建立东南亚军事集团的阴谋，并决心为巩固印度支那的和平，通过普选实现国家的统一，争取在全国实现独立和民主而奋斗到底。
    越南人民保证进一步加强他们和柬埔寨及老挝的人民、亚洲及法国的人民以及全世界爱好和平的人们的团结，坚决为制止美帝国主义者的冒险政策，保卫东南亚和世界的和平而斗争。
