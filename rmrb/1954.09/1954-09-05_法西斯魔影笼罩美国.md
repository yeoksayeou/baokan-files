Fascist Shadows Loom Over America

    The Scandal of So-Called "Witnesses"

    The American government spends money specifically to hire so-called "witnesses" to lie when persecuting innocent people who have been falsely accused, using these lies as a basis for persecution. Recently, scandals involving these "witnesses" have been continuously exposed.

    The "World Trade Union Movement" magazine reported in its eleventh issue this year: In April, when the American government was persecuting Ben Gold, the president of the International Fur and Leather Workers Union of the United States and Canada, a "witness" named John Lauton claimed in court that he had attended a "study group" with Gold in Moscow in 1930 and that the textbook used in the class was the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), Short Course." However, this lie was immediately exposed by Gold's defense lawyer. When the lawyer pointed out that the Russian original of this book was published in 1938 and the English version a year later, Lauton was utterly embarrassed.

    However, the American government should be truly embarrassed. Although it has spent a lot of money in this regard, these stupid so-called "witnesses" can never prove white to be black or light to be darkness.

    Long-Term Expansion of Prisons

    Recently, new reactionary laws have been passed in the United States one after another, and the number of political prisoners has increased rapidly, already causing the American prisons to be "overcrowded." According to an Associated Press report from Washington in July, the U.S. government is planning to expand federal prisons.

    The news said that James Bennett, the director of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, has requested an additional appropriation of $918,000 from Congress to expand prisons and build new federal prisons. Bennett also said that the government is drafting a long-term plan for building new federal prisons. He said:

    "The government should anticipate an increase in the number of prisoners." Because "not only is the national population constantly increasing, but many new laws like the Smith Act are also being passed..."

    Please note: The American government is not only planning to expand prisons, but also drafting a "long-term plan." It can be imagined that a new and long-term disaster is about to befall millions of good American people with this evil plan of the American government!

    The Most Barbaric Law

    The New York "Daily Worker" reported on June 30th: On the morning of June 27th, the residence of the Wade couple near Sivili, Kentucky, was suddenly destroyed by a bomb, causing a loss of $7,000. The newspaper said that the reason for this incident was very simple: because the Wade couple were black!

    The Wade couple had recently moved into an area considered to be inhabited by white people. Before the explosion, local white newspapers issued a series of roars to the couple, fascist thugs shot at their residence with rifles, and Ku Klux Klan members burned crosses nearby - a sign of action. However, the police authorities took a laissez-faire attitude towards this situation. Moreover, when the Wade couple requested the FBI to investigate, they were refused, its "reason" being: this kind of atrocity does not violate American law.

    People can't help but ask: What kind of law is this? The experiences of the Wade couple have answered: It is the most barbaric law formulated by self-proclaimed "superior" white people – the law of racial discrimination!

    The Poison of Obscurantism

    American fascists are spreading the poison of obscurantism to schools across the United States.

    Materials published by the New York "Daily Worker" in mid-July said that many local (especially big cities) education bureaus in the United States are now filled with McCarthyites. They not only persecute educators using so-called "loyalty" investigations, but also directly interfere with the teaching methods of schools. They believe that it is unimportant for students to gain knowledge. They instruct school authorities to despise the most basic courses such as arithmetic, grammar, and history. They also believe that science, music, art, and literature should have no place in schools, and that teachers should focus on teaching yellow movies and telephone company sales promotion techniques.

    American journalist Johannes Steel once wrote: The American government wants to "cultivate a generation of Americans who have no ability to think – a generation of yes-men, a barbaric generation" in schools. According to the American fascists, wouldn't this make it easier for them to drive and rule?

    The Experiences of Batchelor and Others

    The American military authorities continue to persecute some American prisoners of war who were captured in Korea. It has been announced that Batchelor, a former American prisoner of war who initially stated that he did not want to be repatriated, will be tried by a military court starting on August 30th. Another former prisoner of war, Dickinson, who had also stated that he did not want to be repatriated, is being detained in the U.S. military correctional facility in New Cumberland, Pennsylvania, along with some other former prisoners of war, after being sentenced to ten years in prison. Lieutenant Colonel Fleming, an American artillery officer who had been captured, also began to be tried by a military court on August 20th. The atrocities of the American authorities in persecuting former prisoners of war have been opposed by ordinary Americans. Residents of Fleming's hometown - Racine, Wisconsin - held a protest rally. A resident representative said: "The Army authorities will find that the entire city of Racine is supporting Fleming. They will see that he has many friends."

    On January 26th of this year, American prisoners of war at the Songgok-ri camp in Korea who refused repatriation publicly stated that the reason they did not want to return was because the United States was a country full of political persecution, McCarthyism, lynching of black people, and racial discrimination. Now, facts once again prove that the United States is indeed such a country!

### 法西斯魔影笼罩美国

    法西斯魔影笼罩美国
    所谓“证人”的丑闻
    美国政府专门花钱雇用一批所谓“证人”，以便在迫害被诬告的善良人民的时候，让这些家伙出面撒谎，作为根据。近来，这种“证人”的丑闻正在不断地被揭露出来。
    今年第十一期的“世界工会运动”杂志报道：四月间，美国政府迫害美国和加拿大国际皮革工人工会主席班·高尔德的时候，一位名叫约翰·拉顿的“证人”，在法庭上硬说一九三○年他曾和高尔德一起在莫斯科参加过什么“研究班”，而且还说班上用的课本是“联共（布）党史简明教程”。可是，这个谎话当场就被高尔德的辩护律师揭穿了。当这位律师指出这本书的俄文本初版是一九三八年出版，而英文本初版是一年后才出版的时候，拉顿感到狼狈不堪了。
    然而，真正感到狼狈不堪的应该是美国政府。因为它虽然在这方面花了不少钱，可是这些愚蠢的所谓“证人”无论如何也不能把白的证明为黑的，把光明证明为黑暗。
    长期扩大监狱
    近来，美国新的反动法律接二连三地通过，政治犯人数急速地增加，已经使美国监狱有“人满之患”了。据报联社驻华盛顿记者七月间报道，美国政府正在拟制扩大联邦监狱的计划。
    这个消息说，美国监狱局局长詹姆斯·贝奈特已请求国会额外拨款九十一万八千美元，以用来扩大监狱和建筑新的联邦监狱。贝奈特并且说，政府正在拟制关于建筑新的联邦监狱的长期计划。他说：
  “政府应当意料到犯人人数的增加。”因为“不仅全国居民人数在不断增加，而且还在通过许多像史密斯法那样的新法律……”
    请注意：美国政府不仅正在计划扩大监狱，而且还正在拟订“长期计划”。可以想到，一个新的而且是长期的灾难，即将随着美国政府的这种罪恶计划降临到千百万美国善良人民的头上！
    最野蛮的法律
    六月三十日纽约“工人日报”报道：六月二十七日早上，美国肯塔基州西维利近郊的维德夫妇的住宅突然被炸弹炸毁，损失达七千美元。报纸说，这件事发生的原因很简单，只因为维德夫妇是黑人！
    维德夫妇是新近搬到一个被认为是白种人居住的区域来的。在爆炸发生前，当地的白人报纸就向这对夫妇发出了一连串的叫嚣，法西斯暴徒用来福枪射击他们的住宅，三K党分子在附近焚烧了十字架——行动的记号。可是，警察当局对这种情况却采取了纵容的态度。而且当维德夫妇要求联邦调查局进行调查的时候，也遭到了拒绝，它的“理由”是：这种暴行并不违反美国的法律。
    人们不禁要问：这是一种什么样的法律呢？维德夫妇所遭遇到的事情已经作了答复：那就是自封“优越”的白种人订出来的最野蛮的法律——种族歧视的法律！
    蒙昧主义的毒素
    美国法西斯分子正在把蒙昧主义的毒素散布到美国各地的学校中去。
    七月中旬纽约“工人日报”刊载的材料说，目前美国许多地方（特别是大城市）的教育局里都充斥着麦卡锡分子。他们不仅用所谓“忠诚”调查的方法去迫害教育工作者，而且还直接干涉学校的教学方法。他们认为，使学生得到知识是不重要的。他们指令学校当局轻视算术、文法和历史等最基本的课程。他们还认为，科学、音乐、艺术和文学知识在学校中不应该有地位，教师应该着重讲授的，应该是黄色电影和电话公司招揽生意的宣传术。
    美国记者约翰尼斯·斯蒂尔曾经写道：美国政府要在学校中“培养出没有思考能力的一代美国人——唯唯诺诺的一代，野蛮的一代”。按照美国法西斯分子的想法，这样，不就更便于他们的驱使和统治了吗？
    巴契勒等人的遭遇
    美国军事当局继续迫害曾在朝鲜被俘的一些美国战俘。据宣布，最初曾表示不愿遣返的前美国战俘巴契勒，从八月三十日起受军事法庭的审判。另一个曾表示不愿遣返的前战俘狄根逊，在被判处十年徒刑后，正和其他一些前战俘一起被拘禁在宾夕尼亚州新克姆柏兰地方的美军惩戒所中。曾经被俘的美国炮兵军官弗莱明中校，也已在八月二十日开始受军事法庭的审判了。美国当局迫害前战俘的暴行，已受到美国普通人民的反对。弗莱明的家乡——威斯康星州拉辛地方的居民曾举行了抗议集会。一位居民代表说：“陆军当局将发现拉辛全城都在支持弗莱明。他们将看到他有很多朋友。”
    今年一月二十六日，朝鲜松谷里营场拒绝遣返的美国战俘曾公开声明，他们所以不愿意回去，是因为美国是一个充满政治迫害、麦卡锡主义、对黑人的私刑和种族歧视的国家。现在，事实再一次证明，美国正是这样一个国家！
