The revolutionary suggestions made by comrades Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu have shown us the direction for further implementing the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction that "in the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants." They have expressed the hearts of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. We wholeheartedly endorse and firmly support them.

The transfer of public primary schools to the management of production brigades has first solved the problem of who should hold the power in schools. The traitor Liu Shaoqi's so-called vertical leadership line of revisionist education was aimed at excluding the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants from managing schools. In our brigade, the 200 households of poor and lower-middle peasants have only 90 children who have attended ordinary middle schools and technical secondary schools, which means that more than two households share one student. However, in this brigade, there are 28 households of landlords and rich peasants, but they have 54 children who have attended middle school or university, which means nearly two students per household. Why does this phenomenon occur in our proletarian dictatorship state? This is all because the poor and lower-middle peasants have no power to manage schools.

When the poor and lower-middle peasants have no power to manage schools, the bourgeois intellectuals who control the schools educate students according to the bourgeois line of "three separations." Some children of poor and lower-middle peasants originally went to school to better serve the poor and lower-middle peasants in the production brigade. However, after studying for a few years, they become unable to lift heavy objects or carry loads on their shoulders. Some junior high school graduates regretfully say: "After graduating from junior high school, nine years of effort are wasted. I can't lift a big hoe, my back aches when I water the fields, and I can't even be a good accountant for the brigade."

In February of this year, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction that "the school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools can no longer continue," we transferred all the power of primary schools to the poor and lower-middle peasants. Practice has proven that transferring public primary schools to the management of production brigades not only greatly aroused the poor and lower-middle peasants' enthusiasm for running schools but also fully demonstrated that the poor and lower-middle peasants are completely capable of managing schools.

To build a truly revolutionary teaching staff, we not only selected a group of excellent community members suitable for teaching work from among the poor and lower-middle peasants to work in the schools but also systematically and step-by-step educated the original teachers through workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The method of having village school teachers receive work points from the production team is a very important measure for the ideological revolutionization of primary school teachers. Now, some of the new teachers selected from among the poor and lower-middle peasants in our area are already doing this, and some old teachers are also preparing to do so. The advantages of this method are numerous: First, it can truly establish the idea of "the school is my home" among primary school teachers, completely changing the past indifference to class struggle and production struggle in the brigade; second, it allows teachers to better accept the supervision of the poor and lower-middle peasants; third, it prevents teachers from having a lifestyle that is too different from that of the general poor and lower-middle peasants, which is beneficial for teachers to unite with the poor and lower-middle peasants in thought and truly achieve a heart-to-heart connection.

　　工人阶级和贫下中农真正掌握了教育大权
    侯振民、王庆余两同志的革命建议，为我们进一步落实伟大领袖毛主席关于“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校”的指示指明了方向，说出了广大贫下中农的心里话，我们热烈拥护，坚决支持。
    公办小学下放到大队来办，首先解决了学校权力归谁掌握的问题。大叛徒刘少奇推行的一套所谓垂直领导的修正主义教育路线，目的就是为了排斥工人阶级和贫下中农管理学校。我们崔各庄大队崔各庄生产队共有二百户贫下中农，只有九十名子女上过普通中学和中等技术学校，平均两户以上才有一人；而这个生产队里有二十八户地主、富农，却有五十四名子女上中学或大学，平均每户接近两名。在我们无产阶级专政的国家里为什么会发生这种现象？这都是由于贫下中农无权管理学校所造成的。
    贫下中农无权管理学校，把持学校大权的资产阶级知识分子就按照资产阶级“三脱离”的教育路线去教育学生。有些贫下中农子女本来上学是为了回到生产队更好地为贫下中农服务的，可是读了几年书，变得手不能提，肩不能挑。有些初中毕业生懊悔地说：“初中毕业生，白费九年功，大镐拿不动，浇水腰就疼，当个队会计，算盘又不灵。”
    今年二月，我们遵循伟大领袖毛主席“学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了”的教导，把全部小学的大权由贫下中农掌握。实践证明，公办小学下放到大队办，不仅大大激发了贫下中农的办学热情，而且充分显示了贫下中农完全有能力管好学校。
    为了建设一支真正革命化的教师队伍，我们不仅在贫下中农中挑选了一批适宜于担任教学工作的优秀社员到学校里去担任教师，而且对原有教师有计划有步骤地由工农兵对他们进行再教育。
    农村小学教师改为由生产队记工分的办法，对于小学教师实现思想革命化是一个十分重要的措施。现在我们这里有一部分从贫下中农中选拔出来的新教师已经这样做了，一些老教师也准备这样做。实行记工分的办法好处很多：第一个好处是可以真正树立起小学教师以队为家的思想，彻底改变过去那种对队上的阶级斗争、生产斗争漠不关心的现象；第二个好处是教师可以更好地接受贫下中农的监督；第三个好处是在生活上不至和一般贫下中农悬殊很大，有利于同贫下中农在思想上打成一片，真正做到心连心。
