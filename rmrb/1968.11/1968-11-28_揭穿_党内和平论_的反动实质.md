The great leader Chairman Mao personally presided over the convening of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, which has great historical significance. The session unanimously decided to expel the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever and to remove all his positions within and outside the Party. This wise decision declares the complete failure of Liu Shaoqi's counterrevolutionary plot and shatters the dreams of imperialism, modern revisionism, and domestic and foreign reactionaries who attempted to restore capitalism in China. This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The communiqué of the plenary session fully expresses the common aspirations of the revolutionary people of the entire country and speaks the minds of us revolutionary fighters. We fully support it and will resolutely carry it out.

The number one capitalist-roader within the Party, Liu Shaoqi, who has long been hiding within the Party, out of his counterrevolutionary needs, like poisonous fungi fearing sunlight, always tries to cover up class struggle, abolish intra-party struggle, and vigorously advocates the fallacious theory of so-called "intra-party peace."

Liu Shaoqi deliberately obscures the class content and class essence of intra-party struggle, falsely claiming that "because various Party members have different methods of looking at problems, they also have different methods of handling problems, leading to many different opinions, different proposals, and disputes within the Party, leading to intra-party struggle." He reduces the struggle between the two lines within the Party to "different methods of looking at problems." This is Liu Shaoqi's trick to abolish intra-party struggle. According to his reactionary viewpoint, to resolve such "disagreements and disputes," one only needs to "cultivate oneself" and "improve one's methods." This is a complete betrayal of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought on the theory of intra-party struggle.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Different thoughts and struggles within the Party are constantly occurring. This is the reflection of class contradictions in society and the contradictions between new and old things within the Party." Class struggle in society necessarily reflects within the Party. From the day our Party was born, the struggle between the two lines has always been sharply present.

Vice Chairman Lin Biao points out: "One of the greatest characteristics of our Party is that its internal life is one of struggle, not peace, not compromise. Our Party must conduct intra-party struggle to become a strong, progressive Party, a Party with fighting capacity." Under the wise leadership of the greatest genius of the Chinese Communist Party in contemporary times, our beloved great leader Chairman Mao, we have successively smashed the opportunist and revisionist lines represented by Chen Duxiu, Qu Qiubai, Li Lisan, Wang Ming, Zhang Guotao, and Liu Shaoqi. It is through these struggles that our Party has been continuously consolidated, developed, and strengthened. The facts prove that the path our Party has taken is not one of "intra-party peace," but a path filled with class struggle.

We ask the great traitor Liu Shaoqi:

Chen Duxiu, this right-opportunist who bowed down to Chiang Kai-shek, did not allow the proletariat to seize the gun, but let the representative of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, Chiang Kai-shek, strangle the revolution. Is our struggle with Chen Duxiu about "different methods of looking at problems"?

Wang Ming opposed the great leader Chairman Mao, opposed the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. He alternately engaged in "left" adventurism and right opportunism, causing serious damage to the Chinese revolution. Is our struggle with him about "different methods of looking at problems"?

Zhang Guotao betrayed the Party Central Committee, engaged in frenzied splittist activities, and eventually surrendered to the enemy of the people, Chiang Kai-shek. Is our struggle with him about "different methods of looking at problems"?

The Gao-Rao anti-Party alliance engaged in frenzied attacks on the Party; the anti-Party clique led by Peng Dehuai opposed the Party's general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, and conspired to usurp the Party. Is our struggle with them about "different methods of looking at problems"?

You, Liu Shaoqi, act as a running dog of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, fiercely opposing the great leader Chairman Mao, opposing Mao Zedong Thought, and opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, attempting to restore capitalism in China. We expose you and your accomplices, fight you down, and expose your crimes. Is our struggle with you about "different methods of looking at problems"?

No! It is not about "different methods of looking at problems," but about representing different classes, different class standpoints, different worldviews, and different paths. Our struggle with you is not about a struggle over "methods," but a life-and-death class struggle between revolution and counterrevolution, a struggle over whether to establish and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat or to oppose and overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Liu Shaoqi, to abolish intra-party struggle, incessantly "instructs" Party members to "cultivate themselves," saying that one should be "tolerant and forgiving" and "accommodating." He attempts to make Party members abandon ideological struggle, abandon line struggle, and become confused individuals who turn a blind eye and deaf ear to the attacks of class enemies, becoming his "tame tools" for usurping the Party, usurping power, and usurping the military. This is something we will never allow!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "It is either the east wind prevailing over the west wind or the west wind prevailing over the east wind. There is no room for compromise on the issue of line." The struggle between the two lines within the Party is irreconcilable, and only one can overcome the other. Against the counterrevolutionary revisionist line, we must launch a fierce attack and conduct thorough criticism. Against the handful of class enemies hiding within the Party, we must expose them, fight them down, and expose their crimes. We must not be "tolerant and forgiving" or "accommodating" to them. Tolerance towards the enemy is cruelty towards the people. In the face of the enemy's attacks, to be "accommodating" is to indulge and nurture evil. As for those intra-party contradictions that are not of an antagonistic nature, we have always handled them according to Chairman Mao's principle of "unity-criticism-unity-self-criticism-unity," first distinguishing right from wrong, and then uniting comrades. Here, there is no question of unprincipled, right-and-wrong-less "tolerance and forgiveness" or "accommodation."

Liu Shaoqi's "intra-party peace theory" is about preaching peace on the surface while plotting conspiracies behind the scenes. On the surface, he incessantly "instructs," using soft knives to kill, attempting to make us forget class struggle, forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, and forget continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Behind the scenes, he forms cliques, recruits traitors, and launches frenzied attacks on the Party. On the surface and behind the scenes, these two tactics are aimed at achieving his counterrevolutionary goal of restoring capitalism. If his plot succeeds, our country will change color. At that time, "without firing a gun or cannon, the flag on the city gate will be changed." Liu Shaoqi's venomous heart is extremely evil! Pfft! This is a daydream that will never come true!

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "A proletarian party must also renew itself to stay vigorous. Without removing the old and taking in the new, the Party will lose its vigor." We must, through struggle, continuously "remove the old and take in the new," expel those traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, degenerate elements, and other class aliens who have infiltrated the Party, to keep our Party forever young and revolutionary. If we were to have "intra-party peace," the proletarian party would change its nature, the revolution would fail, and the people would suffer.

We revolutionary fighters must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi's counterrevolutionary revisionist line of building the Party, eliminate the poison of the "intra-party peace theory," and become Communist Party members who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, dedicating everything we have to the cause of the Party.

    揭穿“党内和平论”的反动实质
    海军某部战士　王炳贤　吕福庭　魏先德
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持召开的具有伟大历史意义的党的第八届扩大的十二中全会，一致决定，把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外的一切职务。这一英明决定，宣告了刘少奇反革命阴谋的彻底破产，粉碎了帝国主义、现代修正主义和国内外反动派妄图在中国复辟资本主义的迷梦。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。
    全会公报，充分表达了全国革命人民的共同心愿，说出了我们革命战士的心里话，我们完全拥护，坚决执行。
    长期隐藏在党内的头号走资派刘少奇，出于他的反革命需要，如同毒菌害怕阳光一样，总想极力掩盖阶级斗争，取消党内斗争，拚命地鼓吹所谓“党内和平”的谬论。
    刘少奇故意抹杀党内斗争的阶级内容和阶级实质，胡说什么“因为各种党员看问题的方法不同，就使他们处理问题的方法也各不相同，就引起党内许多不同意见、不同主张的分歧和争论，就引起党内的斗争”。把党内两条路线斗争归结为“看问题的方法不同”，这是刘少奇妄图取消党内斗争的诡计。按照他的反动观点，要解决这种“分歧和争论”，只要“自我修养”，“改进一下方法”就行了。这是对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想关于党内斗争理论的彻底背叛。
    毛主席教导我们：“党内不同思想的对立和斗争是经常发生的，这是社会的阶级矛盾和新旧事物的矛盾在党内的反映。”社会上的阶级斗争必然反映到党内，我们党从诞生的那天起，两条路线的斗争就一直尖锐地存在着。
    林彪副主席指出：“我们党最大的特点之一，就是党内生活是斗争的，不是和平的，不是妥协的。我们党要成为坚强的进步的党，有战斗力的党，就要进行党内斗争。”中国共产党在当代最伟大的天才，我们敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，先后粉碎了陈独秀、瞿秋白、李立三、王明、张国焘和刘少奇等为代表的机会主义、修正主义路线。我们党正是通过这一系列的斗争，不断巩固、发展、壮大起来的。事实证明，我们党所走的道路绝不是什么“党内和平”的道路，而是充满着阶级斗争的道路。
    我们喝问大叛徒刘少奇：
    陈独秀这个拜倒在蒋介石脚下的右倾投降主义者，不让无产阶级掌握枪杆子，而让大地主、大资产阶级的代表蒋介石绞杀革命。我们同陈独秀的斗争，难道是什么“看问题的方法不同”吗？
    王明反对伟大领袖毛主席，反对战无不胜的毛泽东思想，反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他时而“左”倾冒险主义，时而右倾投降主义，给中国革命带来了严重损失。我们同他的斗争，难道是什么“看问题的方法不同”吗？
    张国焘背叛党中央，疯狂地进行分裂活动，直至投入人民公敌蒋介石的怀抱。我们同他的斗争，难道是什么“看问题的方法不同”吗？
    高饶反党联盟，大搞“独立王国”，疯狂向党进攻；以彭德怀为首的反党集团，大反党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社，阴谋篡党。我们同他们的斗争，难道是什么“看问题的方法不同”吗？
    你刘少奇充当帝国主义、现代修正主义和国民党反动派的走狗，疯狂反对伟大领袖毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，妄图在中国复辟资本主义。我们把你和你的同伙揪出来，斗倒斗臭。我们同你们的这一场大斗争，难道是什么“看问题的方法不同”吗？
    不！完全不是什么“看问题的方法不同”，而是代表的阶级不同，阶级立场不同，世界观不同，所走的道路不同。我们同你们的斗争，绝不是什么“方法”之争，而是一场革命同反革命的搏斗，是一场我们要建立和巩固无产阶级专政、你们要反对和颠覆无产阶级专政的你死我活的阶级斗争。
    刘少奇为了取消党内斗争，喋喋不休地“教训”党员要“自我修养”，说什么对人要“宽大容忍”，“委曲求全”。他妄图使我们党员放弃思想斗争，放弃路线斗争，变成对阶级敌人的进攻视而不见、听而不闻的糊涂人，成为他篡党篡政篡军的“驯服工具”。这是我们决不容许的！
    毛主席教导我们：“不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风，在路线问题上没有调和的余地。”党内两条路线的斗争是水火不相容的，只能是一方克服一方。对反革命修正主义路线，我们就是要猛烈开火，彻底批判。对隐藏在党内的一小撮阶级敌人，我们就是要把他们揪出来，斗倒斗臭。决不能对他们“宽大容忍”、“委曲求全”。对敌人的宽大，就是对人民的残忍。在敌人进攻面前，搞什么“委曲求全”，那就是姑息养奸。至于对那些不是敌我性质的党内矛盾，我们从来就是按照毛主席团结——批评和自我批评——团结的原则处理的，首先是分清是非，在分清是非的基础上，团结同志。在这里，也根本谈不上什么无原则、无是非的“宽大容忍”、“委曲求全”。
    刘少奇的“党内和平论”，是幕前讲和平，放烟幕；幕后搞阴谋，射毒箭。在幕前，他念念有词地进行“说教”，用软刀子杀人，妄图使我们忘记阶级斗争，忘记无产阶级专政，忘记无产阶级专政下继续革命。在幕后，他结党营私，招降纳叛，向党猖狂进攻。幕前幕后，两样货色，都是为了达到他复辟资本主义的反革命目的。如果他的阴谋得逞，我们的国家就会改变颜色。那时候，“不动枪，不动炮，城门楼上换旗号”。刘少奇的蛇蝎之心，恶毒已极！呸！这是白日做梦，永远办不到！
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“一个无产阶级的党也要吐故纳新，才能朝气蓬勃。不清除废料，不吸收新鲜血液，党就没有朝气。”我们必须通过斗争，不断“吐故纳新”，把那些混进党里的叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派、蜕化变质分子、以及其他阶级异己分子统统清除出党，才能使我们党永葆革命的青春。如果搞什么“党内和平”，无产阶级政党就要改变性质，革命就要失败，人民就要遭殃。
    我们革命战士，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底批判刘少奇的反革命修正主义建党路线，肃清“党内和平论”的流毒，做一个无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的共产党员，为党的事业贡献我们的一切。
