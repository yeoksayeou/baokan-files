A severe financial crisis storm has recently struck the capitalist countries once again, with the franc, pound, and dollar—the three major currencies of the capitalist world—all suffering heavy blows. This perilous situation has brought to the surface and intensified the sharp and complex contradictions among the major imperialist countries led by U.S. imperialism, further fragmenting the imperialist countries.

The current financial crisis storm is a continuation and development of the most severe financial crisis in the Western world in forty years that erupted this past spring. In just over eight months, the financial and monetary system of the capitalist world has been pushed to the brink of collapse twice by the crisis storm. This is a new and important sign of the rapid deepening of the general crisis of capitalist politics and economics and the accelerating decline of imperialism.

This crisis storm was directly triggered by the instability of the franc, one of the major currencies of the capitalist world. After the pound was forced to devalue in mid-November last year and the dollar was forced to undergo a de facto devaluation in the face of a powerful crisis storm this spring, the position of the French franc has become increasingly fragile. This is mainly due to severe inflation in France, a huge trade deficit, and the heavy blow dealt to the French capitalist economy by the large-scale mass struggles of French workers and students in May and June this year. Under these circumstances, rumors about the possible devaluation of the franc have spread widely, and the "credit" of the franc has plummeted on the international capitalist market.

The crisis of the franc quickly spread to the already precarious pound and dollar. Starting from mid-November, a frenzied wave of selling francs, pounds, and dollars, and buying gold and the relatively stable West German mark swept through the major foreign exchange markets in Western Europe and the United States. Under this strong selling and buying pressure, the exchange rates of the franc, pound, and dollar continued to fall below the official rates, and the price of gold rose to over $40 per ounce (the official price is $35). The French government had to order a halt to foreign exchange, gold, and stock trading for three days starting from the 20th; other major financial centers in London, Frankfurt, and major foreign exchange markets in Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia also announced closures, plunging the entire capitalist world into chaos.

This situation caused panic among the imperialist countries. On the 20th, the finance ministers and central bank governors of ten countries, including the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany, hurriedly convened an emergency meeting in Bonn to discuss countermeasures. This meeting fully exposed the sharp and complex contradictions among the major capitalist countries. The essence of these contradictions is that in times of crisis, each side tries to sacrifice others to save itself. The focus of the debate was on whether the franc should be devalued and whether the mark should be revalued (i.e., increasing the mark's value against the dollar, pound, and franc).

The franc is the capital used by the de Gaulle government to challenge the United States' privileged position in the financial and monetary sphere and to compete with the United States for political dominance in Western Europe. The devaluation of the franc would inevitably deal a heavy blow to France politically. Therefore, despite the intense pressure from the United States, Britain, and West Germany to devalue the franc, the French government refused to do so. In his radio address on the 24th, French President de Gaulle formally announced that the franc would not be devalued, emphasizing that devaluing the franc would be "a reward for those who are sure we will collapse." France not only refused to devalue the franc but also joined the United States and Britain in pressuring West Germany to revalue the mark, arguing that only a revaluation of the mark could calm the current selling and buying storm. However, this proposal by the United States, Britain, and France directly contradicted the intentions of the West German ruling class. The West German government feared that a revaluation of the mark would increase the price of West German exports, harm West German exports, reduce West German gold and foreign exchange reserves, and thus weaken West Germany's economic strength and its political bargaining power with the United States, Britain, and France. Therefore, West German Chancellor Kiesinger also delivered a television address, vowing that as long as he was chancellor, he would never agree to a revaluation of the mark.

The United States and Britain, due to the weak positions of the dollar and pound, desperately wanted to stabilize the current situation to maintain the capitalist world's monetary system and the privileged positions of the dollar and pound within it. To cope with the current crisis storm, they hoped for both a revaluation of the mark and a relatively small devaluation of the franc, as the former measure would give them an advantage in export competition with West Germany, and the latter measure would achieve the goal of striking the franc without involving the pound and dollar.

Precisely because these countries had ulterior motives and tried to shift the burden onto their neighbors, the meeting turned into a farce of backstabbing and mutual recriminations.

The French representative blamed the current precarious situation of the franc on the undervaluation of the West German mark, which gave West German products an unfair advantage in export competition. Therefore, he strongly demanded a revaluation of the West German mark. The French representative also threatened that if the United States, Britain, and West Germany continued to pressure the franc to devalue, France would simply devalue the franc significantly, dragging down the currencies of other capitalist countries, especially the shaky pound, along with the franc. The West German representative, in turn, retorted that countries with weak currencies should find their own ways to overcome difficulties rather than expecting others to make sacrifices for them. According to the U.S. *International Herald Tribune*, the West German representative also had a heated argument with the U.S. and British representatives. Britain not only warned West Germany at the meeting that failure to revalue the mark would have "political consequences" but also British Prime Minister Wilson personally delivered a message to the West German government using "rude" language to make a blatant threat. According to Western news agencies, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Jenkins and West German Finance Minister Strauss had a public argument at the meeting. Regarding the United States, West German Economics Minister Schiller also bluntly exposed the weakness of the dollar's position at the meeting. He sarcastically said that the "dollar's value is too high," and it is not the mark that needs to be revalued but the dollar that should be devalued. It turned out that after three days of arguing, no effective measures to cope with the crisis were found, and the contradictions among the parties were not eased.

Meanwhile, the major imperialist countries, such as the United States, Britain, and France, were all concerned that the collapse of the entire capitalist world's financial and monetary system would deal an unpredictable blow to their domestic capitalist finances and economies. Therefore, all sides also made some concessions, attempting to jointly support the situation and overcome the current crisis. It was precisely out of this consideration that West Germany agreed to reduce exports over fifteen months and relax import restrictions to reduce West German foreign exchange earnings, allowing the "deficit countries" to improve their trade positions; in addition, it agreed to provide loans to France with the United States and Britain to support the franc. However, West Germany and other countries originally thought that this "support" for France would lead to the devaluation of the franc, but after the meeting, de Gaulle announced that the franc would not be devalued but only expressed a willingness to further implement austerity policies domestically, that is, to further shift the crisis onto the French working people to "improve" the position of the franc. De Gaulle's decision once again sparked a wave of complaints and attacks.

In the days following the ten-nation meeting, several major financial markets in the West remained shrouded in an atmosphere of instability. The spokesmen for the financial monopolies of the capitalist countries generally believed that whether it was the "austerity measures" taken by France or the "efforts" made by West Germany and other countries to "support" the franc, they were far from enough to quell the current crisis storm. Various signs indicated that the measures taken by the capitalist countries to get out of the crisis could only exacerbate the sharp contradictions among the imperialist countries abroad, leading to more intense currency wars, tariff wars, and trade wars; and domestically, they would intensify political and economic crises, sparking stronger resistance from the people.

Therefore, no matter how these imperialist countries struggle, they cannot escape their accelerating decline. As our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "We are now in an era when the imperialist system is heading towards complete collapse, and the imperialists have fallen into an irresolvable crisis."

    资本主义世界金融危机深重
    法郎英镑美元同时受到沉重打击，帝国主义各国乱作一团，更加分崩离析
    据新华社二十八日讯　本社记者报道：一场严重的金融危机风暴最近再次猛烈冲击资本主义各国，法郎、英镑和美元这三种资本主义世界的主要货币同时受到沉重的打击。这种险恶的局势，使以美帝为首的主要帝国主义国家之间尖锐复杂的矛盾再度表面化、白热化，使帝国主义各国更加分崩离析。
    当前这场正在发展的金融危机风暴是今年春季爆发的西方世界四十年来最严重的金融危机的继续和发展。在短短八个多月里，资本主义世界的金融货币体系接连两次被危机的风暴推向崩溃的边缘，这是资本主义政治经济总危机急速深化，帝国主义加速没落的一个新的、重要的标志。
    这场危机风暴是由于资本主义世界的主要货币之一——法国的法郎地位不稳而直接引起的。继英镑在去年十一月中旬被迫实行贬值，美元在今年春天的强大危机风暴冲击下也被迫实行变相贬值之后，法国的法郎地位越来越脆弱。这主要是因为法国国内通货膨胀严重，对外贸易出现巨额逆差，而今年五、六月间法国工人和学生掀起的大规模群众斗争又给了法国资本主义经济以沉重打击。在这种情况下，有关法郎可能贬值的种种传说，甚嚣尘上，在资本主义国际市场上法郎的“信用”猛烈下降。
    法郎的危机迅速波及到处境本来就岌岌可危的英镑和美元，从十一月中旬开始，在西欧和美国的主要外汇市场上出现了一股疯狂地抛售法郎、英镑和美元，抢购黄金以及地位相对来说比较稳定的西德马克的浪潮。在这股抛风和抢风的强大压力下，法郎、英镑和美元的行情不断下跌，降到了官方牌价以下，黄金价格上涨到了每盎斯四十美元以上（官价是三十五美元）。法国政府不得不下令从二十日起停止外汇、黄金和股票交易三天；伦敦、法兰克福等其他西欧重要金融中心以及非洲、中东和东南亚的主要外汇市场也都纷纷宣布停业，整个资本主义世界一片混乱。
    这种情况使帝国主义各国恐慌万状，美国、英国、法国、西德等十个国家的财政部长和中央银行行长二十日匆匆赶到波恩举行紧急会议，商讨对策。这次会议充分暴露了各主要资本主义国家之间尖锐复杂的矛盾。这种矛盾的实质就是，在大难临头的情况下，各方都力图牺牲别人以保全自己；会上争论的焦点则是围绕着法郎要不要贬值和马克要不要增值（即提高马克对美元、英镑、法郎等的比值）这两个问题。
    法郎是戴高乐政府用来向美国在金融货币领域内的特权地位挑战并同美国在政治上争霸西欧的资本。法郎的贬值不可避免地将会使法国在政治上遭到沉重打击。因此，尽管美、英和西德拚命压法国使法郎贬值，法国政府还是拒绝这样做。法国总统戴高乐在二十四日的广播讲话中正式宣布法郎不贬值时，显然是有所指地强调，法郎贬值将“是对那些确信我们会垮台的人的奖励”。法国不仅拒绝将法郎贬值，反而纠合美、英一起压西德马克增值，理由是只有马克增值才能平息当前这股抛风和抢风。但是，美、英、法的这种主张正好同西德统治集团的打算背道而驰。西德政府害怕马克增值后会使西德出口商品价格相应提高，损害西德的出口贸易，减少西德的黄金外汇储备，从而削弱西德的经济实力地位和它同美、英、法在政治上讨价还价的资本。因此，西德总理基辛格也发表电视讲话，怒气冲冲地发誓，只要他当一天总理，他就决不同意马克增值。
    美、英两国，由于美元和英镑的地位十分虚弱，所以极力想要稳定现状，以便保住当前资本主义世界的货币体系和美元、英镑在其中所享有的特权地位。为了应付当前的危机风暴，它们既希望马克增值，也希望迫使法郎作幅度较小的贬值，因为前一措施可以使它们在同西德在出口竞争方面获得好处，后一措施又可以在不使英镑、美元受到牵累的情况下达到打击法郎的目的。
    正因为这些国家各自心怀鬼胎，竭力想以邻为壑、损人利己，所以会议上便演出了一场勾心斗角，争吵对骂的丑剧。
    法国代表在会上把法郎当前的险恶处境归咎于西德马克的比值定得过低，以致使西德商品在出口竞争中获得了不应有的有利条件，因此，他强烈要求西德马克增值。法国代表还威胁，如果美、英、西德等一味压法郎贬值，法国将干脆使法郎大幅度贬值，从而把其他资本主义国家的货币，特别是地位摇摇欲坠的英镑一起拉下水，跟着法郎贬值。西德代表则对法国反唇相讥，认为货币处于虚弱地位的国家应该自己想办法来度过难关，而不应该指望别人替它作出牺牲。据美国《国际先驱论坛报》透露，会上西德代表同美、英代表也进行了极为激烈的争吵。英国不仅在会上警告西德，如果马克不增值，将会引起“政治后果”，而且英国首相威尔逊还亲自捎话给西德政府，用“粗鲁的”语言进行露骨的威胁。据西方通讯社透露，英国财政大臣詹金斯同西德财政部长施特劳斯曾在会上公开对骂起来。对于美国，西德经济部长席勒在会上也毫不客气地揭了美元地位虚弱的老底。他讽刺“美元的比值定得太高”，不是马克需要增值，而是美元应该贬值。事实证明，经过三天的争吵既没有找出一个应付危机的有效措施，也没有使各方的矛盾得到缓和。
    与此同时，美、英、法等主要帝国主义国家在严重的危机面前都担心，整个资本主义世界金融货币体系的土崩瓦解势将使它们本国的资本主义财政经济遭到难以预测的打击。因此，各方面也都作了某些妥协，妄图共同来支撑危局，度过当前的危机。正是出于这种考虑，西德答应在十五个月内压缩出口，放松对进口的限制，以便减少西德的外汇收入，使各“逆差国”能够改善其外贸地位；此外，它还答应同美国、英国一起向法国提供贷款支持法郎。而西德等国本来以为对法国的这种“支持”会换得法郎的贬值，然而会后戴高乐却宣布法郎不贬值，而只是表示要在国内进一步推行紧缩经济的政策，也就是说要进一步向本国劳动人民转嫁危机，以“改善”法郎的地位。戴高乐的这一决定又再次引起了一片抱怨和攻讦。
    十国会议结束以后几天来的情况表明，西方几个主要金融市场上仍然笼罩着一片不稳定的气氛。资本主义各国金融垄断资本的代言人普遍认为，无论是法国采取的“紧缩措施”还是西德等国为了“支持”法郎地位而作的“努力”，都远不足以平息当前这场危机风暴。种种迹象表明，各资本主义国家为了摆脱危机而采取的各种措施都只能在国外加剧帝国主义各国的尖锐矛盾，引起更加激烈的货币战、关税战、贸易战；在国内加剧政治经济危机，激起国内人民更强烈的反抗。
    因此，不管这些帝国主义国家怎样进行挣扎，都无法摆脱它们加速没落的命运。正如我们伟大的导师毛主席所英明指出的那样：“我们现在所处的时代是帝国主义制度走向全部崩溃的时代，帝国主义者业已陷入不可解脱的危机之中”。
