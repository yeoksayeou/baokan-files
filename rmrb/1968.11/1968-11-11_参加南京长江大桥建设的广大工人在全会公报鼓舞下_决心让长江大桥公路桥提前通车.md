Inspired by the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, the broad masses of revolutionary workers building the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, with boundless proletarian affection for the great leader Chairman Mao, have launched a new upsurge of seizing the revolution and promoting production.

After the communiqué was issued, the revolutionary committee of the bridge engineering department and the People's Liberation Army's support-left, support-work, and guard-bridge units immediately conducted serious study and discussion. In recent days, under the inspiration of the communiqué, the entire bridge construction site has become a battlefield for exposing and settling accounts with the counter-revolutionary crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices, launching a broader and deeper wave of revolutionary criticism. The fourth brigade of the second section of the bridge brought a handful of class enemies to the construction site for supervised labor and on-site struggle sessions. Many veteran workers, with burning indignation, pointed at a handful of class enemies and said, "You thought you could buy us off with money! You're blind! We work for the revolution, the more we work, the more energy we have. With Mao Zedong Thought, we can create any miracle in the world." Now, the flames of revolutionary criticism are burning more fiercely across the entire bridge construction site. In just a few days, the second section of the bridge alone has held over forty class struggle criticism sessions at the brigade level.

During the study of the communiqué, the broad masses of bridge builders, with boundless proletarian affection for the great leader Chairman Mao, expressed their determination: with Chairman Mao backing us, we, the working class, are fearless and full of energy. We must lead everything and can lead everything. They resolved to implement the communiqué with practical actions, achieve victory in both revolution and production, and ensure the early completion of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge road bridge. In recent days, under the inspiration of the communiqué, production records have been broken again and again, and the mass technical revolution and innovation movement has become more vigorous. The workers of the pile driving workshop of the base team of the second section of the bridge completed the steel reinforcement forming task for all the piers and pier caps of the road bridge six days ahead of schedule, scoring a brilliant victory. On November 3, despite the heavy rain, the base team of the fourth section of the bridge was bustling with activity. The workers braved the rain to manufacture pre-stressed beams, setting a new record of producing six and a half beams per day. On the night of the day the communiqué was issued, the workers of the fourth brigade of the Nanjing Municipal Public Works Company, who were installing the arch ribs in the fourth bridge hole, heard the broadcast, redoubled their efforts, and immediately launched a competitive wave of surpassing each other. They studied and improved the operating procedures, doubling the work efficiency and setting a new historical record.

　　参加南京长江大桥建设的广大工人在全会公报鼓舞下
　　决心让长江大桥公路桥提前通车
    据新华社南京十日电　在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的鼓舞下，参加南京长江大桥建设的广大革命工人，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限深厚的无产阶级感情，掀起了狠抓革命猛促生产的新高潮。
    公报发表以后，大桥工程处革命委员会和人民解放军支左、支工、护桥部队，马上进行了认真的学习和讨论。连日来，在公报的鼓舞下，整个大桥工地，到处摆开了声讨和清算刘少奇及其同伙反革命罪行的战场，掀起了一个更广泛、更深入的革命大批判高潮。大桥四处二队把本单位的一小撮阶级敌人带到工地，就地监督劳动，就地批斗。许多老工人怀着满腔的怒火，指着一小撮阶级敌人说：“你们想用钱来收买我们，真是瞎了眼！我们为革命干活，越干越有劲，有了毛泽东思想，什么人间奇迹都能创造出来。”现在，整个大桥工地，革命大批判的烈火越烧越旺，仅大桥二处在短短几天内，班组大批判已经开展了四十多次。
    广大建桥工人在学习公报的时候，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限深厚的无产阶级感情，纷纷表示：有毛主席撑腰，我们工人阶级浑身是胆，浑身是劲，一定要领导一切，一定能够领导一切。他们决心以实际行动落实公报，夺取革命、生产双胜利，保证长江大桥公路桥提前通车。这几天，在公报的鼓舞下，生产纪录一破再破，群众性的技术革命和技术革新运动更加蓬勃发展。大桥二处基地队管桩车间的广大工人一鼓作气，提前六天完成了公路桥所有的桥墩墩身和墩帽的钢筋成型任务，打了个漂亮仗。十一月三日，风雨交加，但大桥四处基地队却热气腾腾，工人们冒雨赶制预应力梁，创造了日产六片半梁的最高纪录。公报发表的当天深夜，在四号桥孔进行拱波安装工作的南京市政工程公司四队的工人们，听了广播，干劲倍增，立即掀起了一场你追我赶的竞赛热潮。他们研究改进了操作规程，使工效成倍提高，刷新了历史纪录。
