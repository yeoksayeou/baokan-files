The members of the Ping Shan County Revolutionary Committee have been steadfast in using Chairman Mao's "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China" to guide their thoughts and work. They continuously raise their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, ensuring the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest directives and consolidating and developing the new proletarian revolutionary power.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Ping Shan County Revolutionary Committee, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's support team, has been diligently studying Chairman Mao's "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China." They frequently use this report as a mirror to reflect on their thoughts and work, raising their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. This has ensured the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest directives and consolidated and developed the new proletarian revolutionary power, achieving one victory after another in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Studying Chairman Mao's Report at the Seventh Plenary Session, Striving to Raise Awareness of the Struggle Between the Two Lines

	On the first day of the establishment of the Ping Shan County Revolutionary Committee, all members studied Chairman Mao's report to the Seventh Plenary Session. They recognized that this brilliant report, made by Chairman Mao nineteen years ago, is the great blueprint for socialist revolution and socialist construction, and a beacon for continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. As long as the Revolutionary Committee seriously studies this brilliant report by Chairman Mao, other important works by Chairman Mao, and the series of important instructions given by Chairman Mao during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and continuously raises the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, it will definitely be able to lead the people of the entire county to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	The Ping Shan County Revolutionary Committee has included the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings from the Seventh Plenary Session: "The victory of the entire country is only the first step of the long march of ten thousand li. The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and the struggle is more arduous. This must be made clear to the Party now, and comrades must continue to maintain a humble, prudent, unarrogant, and unhurried attitude, and comrades must continue to maintain the spirit of hard struggle," in the first resolution of the County Revolutionary Committee, "The Current Situation and Future Tasks," to guide their actions. They then, with high morale, launched a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies.

	Soon after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, a handful of class enemies on one hand spread various rumors to try to destroy the Revolutionary Committee, and on the other hand, incited conflicts among the masses in some production brigades, disrupting and interfering with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments. The Revolutionary Committee, following Chairman Mao's teachings, promptly exposed the tricks of the class enemies and mobilized the masses to give them a heavy blow. In the remote Daxiangshan Brigade, far from the county seat, the capitalist roaders within the Party and rich farmers colluded to attack the poor and lower-middle peasants, obstructing the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest directives. The deputy head of the Revolutionary Committee and military representative, Zhang Cong, and the standing committee member, An Shuanglu, led the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army to conduct in-depth investigations, propagate Chairman Mao's latest directives, and live, eat, and work with the poor and lower-middle peasants. They quickly exposed the bad elements. When the work of cleaning up the class ranks began, a handful of class enemies again spread the air, saying that Ping Shan County is an old revolutionary base, the class struggle is not complicated, there are no class enemies, and so on. The main leaders of the Revolutionary Committee and the military representatives organized all members of the Revolutionary Committee to carry Mao Zedong's works to the site of the Seventh Plenary Session of the Party—Xibaipo, and held a study class on Mao Zedong Thought with the theme "Grasp the class struggle and do not turn away, carry the revolution to the end." Everyone reviewed Chairman Mao's report to the Seventh Plenary Session, studied Chairman Mao's latest directives, and invited old poor peasants who had personally received Chairman Mao's teachings to talk about the history of class struggle in Xibaipo and the evil activities of the current class enemies. After the study class, the Revolutionary Committee mobilized the people of the entire county to launch a new high tide of criticizing the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle," seriously carrying out the work of cleaning up the class ranks, exposing the class enemies hidden within the revolutionary ranks, and achieving new victories in the struggle against the enemy.

	Studying Chairman Mao's Report at the Seventh Plenary Session, Promoting the Deep Development of Struggle, Criticism, and Transformation

	After the establishment of the Ping Shan County Revolutionary Committee, following Chairman Mao's instruction, "Our current important task on the ideological front is to carry out a criticism of revisionism," they used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to carry out revolutionary criticism, promoting the struggle, criticism, and transformation on all fronts.

	After achieving some results in the revolutionary criticism, some communes and brigades were busy with production, and the revolutionary criticism was not as active as before. The Revolutionary Committee believed that this was a manifestation of insufficient understanding of the long-term, complex, and sharp nature of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and the emergence of self-satisfaction and relaxation. Therefore, the Revolutionary Committee organized the broad revolutionary masses to seriously study Chairman Mao's report to the Seventh Plenary Session. Chairman Mao pointed out: "Because of victory, the Party may develop arrogance, the attitude of considering oneself a hero, the attitude of stopping and not seeking progress, the attitude of seeking pleasure and not wanting to live a hard life." Through study, the understanding was corrected. Many comrades said: In the face of victory, one can only be humble and prudent, and march forward, not satisfied in the slightest.

	On this basis, the Revolutionary Committee organized the revolutionary people of the entire county to fully display the current situation of class struggle in the locality and the country, find the gap in carrying out revolutionary criticism in their own units, formulate plans for carrying out revolutionary criticism in the future, and hold a county-wide class struggle mobile exhibition. Through these activities, the revolutionary criticism in the entire county was carried out vigorously again, effectively promoting the struggle, criticism, and transformation. The County Revolutionary Committee simplified the organization, the first time simplifying it to more than a hundred people, which was one-fourth of the original County Party Committee and County People's Committee staff. Later, after criticizing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the construction of political power, it was simplified to sixty people. Recently, it is planned to further simplify the organization on the basis of carrying out revolutionary criticism in depth. In the work of rectifying and building the Party, there were many rules and regulations at the beginning, which restricted the masses' hands and feet. After criticizing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line of building the Party, the masses were mobilized to carry out open rectification, seriously implementing Chairman Mao's latest instruction of "expelling the old and taking in the new," and the work of rectifying and building the Party developed vigorously.

	Studying Chairman Mao's Report at the Seventh Plenary Session, Carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the End

	After the publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, personally presided over by the great leader Chairman Mao, the Ping Shan County Revolutionary Committee seriously studied, propagated, and actively implemented and carried out the directives. Everyone unanimously believed that under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the entire county has achieved great and decisive victories. In the face of victory, one must remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Absolutely do not relax one's fighting will, any thought of relaxing fighting will and any thought of underestimating the enemy are wrong." The members of the County Revolutionary Committee once again went to Xibaipo to hold a study class on Mao Zedong Thought, with the main content being the implementation of the various tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee. They used Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Old Three Articles" and the report to the Seventh Plenary Session as weapons to consciously carry out the struggle against selfishness and criticism of revisionism, promote the revolutionization of thought, and first implement the various tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenary Session in their own minds.

	After the study, the Ping Shan County Revolutionary Committee, in order to fully implement the series of combat tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee in all fronts of the entire county, grasped five points:

	First, the members of the Revolutionary Committee set an example, mobilizing the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres of the entire county to use "Old Three Articles" as a weapon to consciously carry out the struggle against selfishness and criticism of revisionism, promoting the revolutionization of thought.

	Second, seriously study Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, and tactics of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. Recently, the County Revolutionary Committee, in conjunction with the implementation of the various tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenary Session, summarized and inspected the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in practice, convened a conference of representatives of active learners of Mao Zedong Thought in the entire county, and further implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest directives.

	Third, grasp the class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and consolidate the new proletarian revolutionary power in the great winds and waves.

	Fourth, carry forward the Party's three great styles of work, link theory with practice, closely connect with the masses, and carry out criticism and self-criticism.

	Fifth, the leadership at all levels continuously summarizes experience in the struggle, raises the level of struggle, and continuously carries out the re-study and re-education of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

	At present, the struggle, criticism, and transformation on all fronts in the urban and rural areas of Ping Shan County have entered a new high tide. Revolutionary criticism, cleaning up the class ranks, rectifying and building the Party, educating the revolution, and promoting production through revolution are being carried out more deeply. The mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in practice is more extensive and in-depth than before, and agricultural production has achieved a bumper harvest. Winter agricultural water conservancy construction has begun. The revolutionary masses of the entire county are closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, striving for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告是在无产阶级专政下继续革命的灯塔
    平山县革委会成员坚持以毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》统帅自己的思想和工作，不断提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，保证了毛主席一系列最新指示的贯彻落实，巩固和发展了新生的无产阶级革命政权
    据新华社石家庄二十五日电　河北省平山县革命委员会从去年成立以来，在人民解放军支左部队的帮助下，认真学习毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》，经常以这个报告为镜子，对照自己的思想和工作，提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，从而保证了毛主席的一系列最新指示的贯彻落实，巩固和发展了新生的无产阶级革命政权，取得了无产阶级文化大革命一个又一个胜利。
    学习毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告，努力提高两条路线斗争的觉悟
    平山县革命委员会成立的第一天，全体成员就学习了毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告。大家认识到，毛主席在十九年前所作的这个光辉报告，是社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大纲领，是在无产阶级专政下继续革命的灯塔。革命委员会只要认真学习毛主席的这个光辉报告、毛主席的其他许多重要著作和在无产阶级文化大革命中所作的一系列重要指示，不断提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，就一定能率领全县人民去夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    平山县革命委员会把伟大领袖毛主席在七届二中全会上所作的教导：“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。……中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。这一点现在就必须向党内讲明白，务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风”，写进县革委会的第一个决议《目前形势和今后的任务》中，用来指导自己的行动，并随即斗志昂扬地继续向一小撮阶级敌人发动了猛烈进攻。
    县革委会成立不久，一小撮阶级敌人一方面散布各种流言蜚语，妄图搞垮革委会，一方面在一些大队挑动群众斗群众，破坏和干扰毛主席的伟大战略部署。革委会遵照毛主席的教导，及时识破阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，发动群众给以沉重的打击。距县城较远的下盘松大队，党内走资派和富农分子勾结在一起，打击贫下中农，阻挠毛主席一系列最新指示的贯彻落实。革委会副主任、军队代表曾从和常委安双录，就带领解放军战士，到那里深入调查研究，宣传毛主席的最新指示，和贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动，发动群众，很快揪出了坏人。清理阶级队伍工作开始的时候，一小撮阶级敌人又散布空气，说什么平山县是老区，阶级斗争不复杂，没有什么阶级敌人，等等。革委会主要负责人和解放军代表就组织革委会全体成员，带着毛主席著作，来到党的七届二中全会会址——西柏坡，举办以“狠抓阶级斗争不转向，将革命进行到底”为内容的毛泽东思想学习班。大家重温了毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告，学习毛主席的最新指示，请亲自受过毛主席教诲的老贫农讲述西柏坡的阶级斗争史和当前阶级敌人的罪恶活动。学习班结束以后，革委会发动全县人民又一次掀起了狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”的新高潮，认真开展清理阶级队伍的工作，挖出了暗藏在革命队伍内部的阶级敌人，取得了对敌斗争的新胜利。
    学习毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告，推动斗、批、改深入发展
    平山县革命委员会成立以后，遵照毛主席的“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判”的教导，以毛泽东思想为武器，开展革命大批判，推动各条战线的斗、批、改。
    在革命大批判取得一定成绩以后，有的社、队忙于抓生产，革命大批判不如以前活跃了。革委会认为，这是对阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的长期性、复杂性、尖锐性认识不足，出现自满松劲情绪的表现。于是，革委会组织广大革命群众认真学习毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告。毛主席指出：“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。”通过学习，端正了大家的认识。许多同志说：在胜利面前，只能谦虚、谨慎，阔步前进，不能有丝毫满足。
    在这个基础上，革委会组织全县革命人民大摆当地和全国阶级斗争的形势，找本单位开展革命大批判的差距，制订今后开展革命大批判的计划，还举办全县阶级斗争巡回展览。通过这些活动，全县革命大批判又如火如荼地开展起来，有力地推动了斗、批、改。县革委会精简机构，第一次精简为一百多人，比原县委、县人委机关的工作人员少了四分之三，觉得差不多了。后来进一步批判了刘少奇在政权建设方面推行的反革命修正主义路线，又精简为六十人。最近，还准备在深入开展革命大批判的基础上，再一次精简机构。在整党建党工作中，开始条条框框很多，束缚了群众的手脚。在批判了刘少奇的反革命修正主义建党路线以后，放手发动群众，进行开门整党，认真贯彻毛主席的“吐故纳新”的最新指示，整党建党工作蓬勃向前发展。
    学习毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持的党的八届扩大的十二中全会的公报发表后，平山县革命委员会认真学习、宣传，积极贯彻、落实。大家一致认为，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，全县的无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了伟大的决定性的胜利。在胜利面前，必须牢记毛主席的教导：“绝对不可以稍微松懈自己的战斗意志，任何松懈战斗意志的思想和轻敌的思想，都是错误的。”县革委会全体成员再次到西柏坡举办了以落实党的八届扩大的十二中全会提出的各项任务为中心内容的毛泽东思想学习班。他们以毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”和在七届二中全会上的报告为武器，自觉地开展斗私批修，促进思想革命化，使十二中全会提出的各项任务首先在自己思想深处落实。
    经过学习，平山县革委会为了在全县各条战线全面落实党的八届扩大的十二中全会提出的一系列战斗任务，狠抓了五点：
    一，革委会成员以身作则，发动全县无产阶级革命派和革命群众，以“老三篇”为武器，自觉地开展斗私批修，促进思想革命化。
    二，认真学习毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论、路线、方针、政策，发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神。最近，县革委会结合落实十二中全会提出的各项任务，对活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动进行了总结和检查，召开了全县活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会，进一步落实毛主席的一系列最新指示。
    三，狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争，在大风大浪中巩固新生的无产阶级革命政权。
    四，发扬党的三大作风，理论联系实际，密切联系群众，开展批评和自我批评。
    五，各级领导在斗争中不断总结经验，提高斗争水平，不断进行毛主席革命路线的再学习、再教育。
    目前，平山县城镇和农村各条战线的斗、批、改出现新的高潮。革命大批判、清理阶级队伍、整党建党、教育革命、抓革命促生产等项工作更加深入地开展，活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动比过去更加广泛深入，农业生产获得大丰收，冬季农田水利建设已经展开。全县革命群众正紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
