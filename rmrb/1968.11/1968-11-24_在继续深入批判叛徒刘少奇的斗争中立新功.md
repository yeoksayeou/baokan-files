The Plenum calls on all Party members and the people of the entire country to continue to deeply carry out the revolutionary criticism and sweep away the reactionary revisionist ideology of Liu Shaoqi and other top capitalist-roaders within the Party.

	In the continuing and deepening struggle to criticize traitor Liu Shaoqi, we, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai Brigade, Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, are achieving new victories.

	Under the guidance of the communiqué of the 12th Plenum of the 8th Central Committee of the Party, the people of the entire country are launching an even more fierce assault against the traitor, secret agent, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi. Every criticism meeting and every critical article are like cannon shells aimed at Liu Shaoqi, hitting hard, hitting fiercely, and hitting accurately. This truly makes us poor and lower-middle peasants feel exhilarated!

	In the midst of the continuing and deepening wave of revolutionary criticism, we have heard some voices of slackening and discouragement. These views are detrimental to the continuing and deepening of revolutionary criticism and need to be debated.

	“A dead tiger doesn’t need to be beaten.” Those who hold this view believe that Liu Shaoqi has already been permanently expelled from the Party and stripped of all his positions inside and outside the Party. They think that a “dead tiger” won’t harm anyone anymore! Is that really the case? No, it isn’t. Chairman Mao said: “The enemy will not disappear of its own accord. Whether it is the reactionaries in China or the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, they will not withdraw from the historical stage of their own accord.” Liu Shaoqi, this criminal traitor, secret agent, and capitalist-roader, although expelled from the Party, his reactionary revisionist poisonous and stinking ideology has not been completely eliminated. If we do not thoroughly sweep away Liu Shaoqi’s reactionary revisionist ideology, after some time, when the conditions are right, his agents might come out again to cause trouble. Capitalism might be restored, and the achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution would be lost. We poor and lower-middle peasants would suffer twice the hardships and twice the bitterness. Therefore, Liu Shaoqi’s downfall does not mean that everything is peaceful and trouble-free. The revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary people must not “let down their guard and put away their weapons” and sleep soundly. Instead, they should, under the inspiration of the communiqué, continue to advance bravely and carry out the revolutionary criticism deeply, thoroughly, and completely. We will not rest until we politically and ideologically bury Liu Shaoqi’s revisionist line!

	“There is no local material to criticize.” Those who hold this view believe that Liu Shaoqi is far from us, we have never seen him, and he has not come to our place to spread poison. They think that criticizing Liu Shaoqi is not well connected with local conditions. Is that really the case? No, it isn’t. In Dazhai, Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Shanxi, Jinzhong, and Xiyang have done countless evil deeds. Dazhai has grown up in the struggle against Liu Shaoqi. For example, in response to Chairman Mao’s great call, we took the road of collectivization, but Liu Shaoqi, this evil guy, opposed us from establishing cooperatives early and establishing large cooperatives; during the period of economic difficulties caused by natural disasters, we defended the general line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the people’s communes, the three red banners. Liu Shaoqi, this evil guy, advocated “three autonomies and one contract” and “four freedoms,” spreading the evil wind of “white grass, black market, and small plots of land”; in 1964, Chairman Mao issued the great call to “learn from Dazhai in agriculture,” but Liu Shaoqi, this evil guy, strongly opposed learning from Dazhai; Chairman Mao called for a great socialist education movement, but Liu Shaoqi, this evil guy, instructed his agents to bring the “Peach Garden Experience” and, under the guise of “Four Cleanups,” came to persecute us, attempting to cut down the red flag of Dazhai. Such iron-clad facts are the best materials for criticism. We use local living materials to criticize Liu Shaoqi, which allows us to criticize him accurately and fiercely. In this way, we can criticize more vigorously.

	“Old materials cannot be criticized anew.” Those who hold this view believe that Liu Shaoqi’s revisionist ideology has been criticized many times, and old materials cannot achieve new heights. We believe that it is not the criticism materials that are old, but some people have developed war-weariness, thinking that the revolutionary criticism has been done “well enough.” In fact, the revolutionary criticism is not “well enough” but “far from enough.” Criticizing old materials once gives us a new understanding, criticizing once deepens our hatred for Liu Shaoqi, and once increases our loyalty to Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line. Only by criticizing deeply can we carry out various reforms well. Therefore, we should not think that criticizing Liu Shaoqi’s reactionary revisionist ideology ten or eight times is enough, nor should we think that criticizing him a hundred or a thousand times is enough. Instead, we should criticize him at all times, in all matters, and in all places, day by day, month by month, and year by year, generation after generation, until Liu Shaoqi’s black goods have no market in society. We should regard criticizing Liu Shaoqi’s reactionary revisionist ideology as the most important combat mission and criticize him with the fierceness of not sharing the same sky, criticizing him continuously until we uproot revisionism.

	“Others have already criticized, so we don’t need to criticize again.” Those who hold this view believe that Liu Shaoqi’s crimes have already been criticized by others, and if we criticize again, aren’t we just saying the same things? This understanding is wrong. Criticizing revisionism is a class struggle on the ideological front, and others cannot replace your own struggle. You should know that “without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism, it is revolution. Destruction must argue, arguing is construction, with destruction in the lead, construction is also within it.” Other people’s criticism cannot replace your own criticism; other places having swept away Liu Shaoqi’s reactionary revisionist ideology through criticism does not mean that Liu Shaoqi’s revisionist poison has been eliminated in your local area; other people having drawn a clear line between socialism and revisionism through revolutionary criticism does not mean that you have also drawn this line in your own thoughts. Therefore, regarding Liu Shaoqi’s heinous crimes, we should criticize those that others have criticized, and we should criticize even more those that others have not criticized. Criticize, and criticize repeatedly, seize the key points to criticize, and criticize thoroughly!

	“Rustics cannot criticize deeply.” Those who hold this view believe that poor and lower-middle peasants, who can barely read a few characters, engage in revolutionary criticism, which is a matter of writing and speaking a lot, and only then can it be called deep criticism. “Rustics” cannot do it. Is that really the case? Absolutely not. Although we poor and lower-middle peasants have a low level of culture and cannot write a long article or speak a lot of theory, we have a heart that is loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. We grasp one principle, which is the struggle between Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line and Liu Shaoqi’s reactionary line. Our class feelings are deep, our love and hate are very clear, our sense of right and wrong is clear, and we have a deep hatred for Liu Shaoqi, this big bad guy; we have the best weapon, which is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, our criticism can hit the target, like a sharp dagger, stabbing into Liu Shaoqi’s black heart. Can it be said that rustics cannot criticize deeply?

	Chairman Mao said: “One of our important tasks on the ideological front now is to carry out a criticism of revisionism.” The 12th Plenum of the 8th Central Committee calls on: “All Party members and the people of the entire country to continue to deeply carry out the revolutionary criticism and sweep away the reactionary revisionist ideology of Liu Shaoqi and other top capitalist-roaders within the Party.” We, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai, firmly respond to this call. We will raise high the iron shovel of revolutionary criticism and thoroughly bury the enemy of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, Liu Shaoqi! If we do not thoroughly criticize and expose the traitor Liu Shaoqi and his reactionary revisionist ideology, which brings disaster to the country and the people, we will not be able to eat in peace or sleep soundly. Comrades in revolution throughout the country, let us together achieve new victories in the struggle to criticize Liu Shaoqi!

### 在继续深入批判叛徒刘少奇的斗争中立新功

    全会号召全党同志和全国人民继续深入展开革命大批判，肃清刘少奇等党内最大的一小撮走资派的反革命修正主义的思想。
    摘自《中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会公报》
    在继续深入批判叛徒刘少奇的斗争中立新功
    山西省昔阳县大寨大队贫下中农
    在党的八届十二中全会公报的指引下，全国人民正以更加猛烈的火力，对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇展开革命大批判，一个个的批判会，一篇篇的批判文章，都是射向叛徒刘少奇的炮弹，打得狠，打得猛，打得准，真使俺们贫下中农感到心里痛快！
    在继续深入展开革命大批判的浪潮中，我们听到一些松劲、泄气的议论，这些论调反映的思想对继续深入展开革命大批判是不利的，有必要辩论一番。
    “死老虎不用再打”。有这种思想的人，认为刘少奇已经被永远开除出党，撤消了党内外一切职务，“死老虎”不会吃人啦！真的是这样吗？不是的。毛主席说：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”刘少奇这个罪恶累累的叛徒、内奸、工贼，虽然被清除出党，但他散布的反革命修正主义毒气、臭气，还远没有肃清。如果不把刘少奇的反革命修正主义思想彻底肃清，过了一些年月以后，一旦气候适宜，刘少奇的代理人还可能重新跑出来捣乱，资本主义仍然可能复辟，这场无产阶级文化大革命的成果就会葬送，我们贫下中农就要吃二遍苦、受二茬罪。因此，刘少奇垮了台，不等于天下太平无事，无产阶级革命派和广大革命人民丝毫不能“马放南山，刀枪入库”，睡大觉，而要在公报的鼓舞下，继续奋勇前进，把革命大批判搞深、搞透、搞彻底。不从政治上、思想上彻底埋葬刘少奇的修正主义路线，誓不罢休！
    “本地没材料可批”。有这种思想的人，认为刘少奇离我们远，我们又没见过他的面，他又没来我们这里直接放毒，咱批判刘少奇和本地情况不好结合。真的是这样吗？不是的。在我们大寨，刘少奇及其在山西、晋中、昔阳的代理人干尽了坏事，大寨就是在同刘少奇斗争过程中成长起来的。比如，我们响应毛主席的伟大号召，走集体化的道路，刘少奇这个坏家伙却反对我们早办社、办大社；由于自然灾害造成的经济困难时期，我们保卫社会主义建设总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，刘少奇这个坏家伙却鼓吹“三自一包”、“四大自由”，刮起了“白草、黑市、小块地”的妖风；一九六四年，毛主席发出了“农业学大寨”的伟大号召，刘少奇这个坏家伙却极力反对学大寨；毛主席号召进行伟大的社会主义教育运动，刘少奇这个坏家伙却指使他的代理人拿着“桃园经验”，借“四清”之名，来整我们，妄图砍倒大寨红旗。如此等等活生生的铁的事实，都是最好的批判材料。我们拿当地的活材料批判刘少奇，就能作到就地取材，狠批刘少奇。这样，有的放矢地批判，越批越起劲。
    “老材料批不新”。有这种思想的人，认为刘少奇的修正主义思想，已经批判过多次了，老材料批不出新水平。我们认为，不是批判材料老，而是有的人头脑里产生厌战情绪，认为大批判搞得“差不多”了。实际上，大批判不是搞得“差不多”，而是还“差得多”。老材料批判一次有一次新的认识，批判一次对刘少奇的仇恨深一层，对毛主席的革命路线的忠心增长一分。批得深才能把各项改革改得好。因此，我们对刘少奇的反革命修正主义思想，不是批十次八次就够了，也不是批百次千次就够了，而是要时时、事事、处处批，日日、月月、年年批，世世代代批，一直批得刘少奇的黑货在社会上没半点市场。要把批判刘少奇的反革命修正主义思想，当作最重要的战斗任务，要以不共戴天的狠劲去批，要一直批下去，直到把修正主义连根除掉。
    “别人已批过，用不着咱再批”。有这种思想的人，认为刘少奇的罪行别人已经批判过了，咱再批还不是重说那几句话吗？这种认识不对。批修，是政治思想阵地上的阶级斗争，别人代替不了你自己的斗争。要知道，“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”别人的批判，并不能等于自己的批判，别的地方通过批判肃清了刘少奇的反革命修正主义思想，并不等于在你本地也肃清了刘少奇的修正主义流毒；别人通过革命大批判，划清了社会主义与修正主义的界限，并不等于你自己思想上也划清了这个界限。因此，对于刘少奇的滔天罪行，别人批判过的，我们还要批，别人没有批判过的，我们更要批。批，就要反复批，要抓住要害批，要批彻底！
    “大老粗批不深”。有这种思想的人，认为贫下中农斗大字不识几个，大批判是耍笔动墨的事，要写一大篇，说一大套，才能批深，“大老粗”不行。真的是这样吗？完全不是。我们贫下中农虽然文化水平不高，写不出一大篇文字，说不出一大套理论，但我们有一颗忠于毛泽东思想的红心，我们抓住一条纲，就是毛主席革命路线同刘少奇反革命路线的斗争，我们的阶级感情深，爱憎最分明，是非界限分得清，同刘少奇这个大坏蛋有刻骨的仇恨；我们有最好的武器，这就是战无不胜的毛泽东思想，因此我们的批判能击中要害，活象一把把锋利的匕首，捅进刘少奇的黑心窝，这能说大老粗批不深吗？
    毛主席说：“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。”党的八届扩大的十二中全会号召：“全党同志和全国人民继续深入展开革命大批判，肃清刘少奇等党内最大的一小撮走资派的反革命修正主义的思想。”我们大寨贫下中农坚决响应这个号召，我们要高高举起革命大批判的铁铲，彻底埋葬工农兵的死敌刘少奇！不把祸国殃民的害人虫刘少奇和他的反革命修正主义思想彻底批倒批臭，我们就吃饭不香，睡觉不甜。全国革命的同志们，让我们一起在批判刘少奇的斗争中立新功！
