		Following Chairman Mao is Victory (Duet Play)
		Lü Hongsheng

		(Drums and gongs can be heard in the distance,
		Wei Dong, full of joy, enters)

		Wei Dong: Ten thousand red flags fluttering,
		The blue sky is filled with colorful clouds,
		The sound of drums and gongs echoes across the seas,
		The Party's Twelfth Plenum communiqué
		has been issued!

		The forest farm is holding a celebration,
		My father and I are both attending,
		Though he is fifty-eight this year,
		He follows Chairman Mao without lagging behind.

		Look, my father is coming.

		(Old worker Lin Laozhong sings "Sailing the Great Sea Depends on the Helmsman" and enters)

		Wei Dong: Father, what are you holding?
		Lin Laozhong: This is a speech manuscript,
		Your father is going on stage to speak.
		Last night, after hearing the good news, I couldn't sleep all night,
		My heart was surging with waves,
		My calloused hands wrote a speech manuscript,
		To tell Chairman Mao the words from the hearts of the forest workers.

		Wei Dong: Father, the heartfelt words can't be contained in the sky,
		What do you want to say?
		Lin Laozhong: What to say?
		Chairman Mao's kindness is greater than the heavens,
		Chairman Mao is the great savior of our workers,
		Chairman Mao is better than our own parents.

		Wei Dong: Father's words, I will remember,
		We will follow the path pointed out by Chairman Mao!

		Lin Laozhong: Son, look at that—
		Wei Dong: The chimneys stand tall into the clouds,
		The factory hums with machinery.

		Lin Laozhong: Son, look at the foot of the mountain,
		Wei Dong: The workers' dormitories stand in rows,
		The old pine trees have loudspeakers hanging.

		Lin Laozhong: Look at the hillside,
		Wei Dong: The "East is Red" tractors climb the mountains,
		A pile of logs like a great mountain.

		Lin Laozhong: Son, look further,
		Wei Dong: Ten thousand miles of forest roll with green waves,
		Ten thousand acres of pine trees roar with a rush.

		Lin Laozhong: But in the old society,
		No matter how big the sky or the earth,
		We workers had no way out!

		Acorns were hard to make into porridge,
		We wore sackcloth to endure winter and summer.
		The overseer's whip was cruel,
		They treated us workers like cattle,
		Starving your grandfather, freezing your grandmother,
		Your father ended up with scars all over.

		Wei Dong: Father! The bloody history of the working class,
		I will remember it all,
		I will stride forward on the revolutionary path.

		Lin Laozhong: It's not that we workers are destined to suffer,
		It's that we didn't have the guns and the seal.

		A thunderous spring roar shook the heavens,
		The power of Mao Zedong Thought is great,
		Chairman Mao led us in revolution,
		The thousand-year-old shackles were shattered!

		Wei Dong: We workers have taken power,
		We have become masters and heads of households.

		Lin Laozhong: But the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi,
		Tried to pull China down the wrong path.

		He advocated "self-reliance, self-management, self-improvement, and contracting out",
		"Exploitation is beneficial",
		He wanted workers and peasants to become cattle again.

		Wei Dong: He is the agent of American and Soviet revisionism,
		He is the chief steward of the landlords.

		As long as he is there, there will be no future for our people.

		Lin Laozhong: Chairman Mao is truly great!
		He personally initiated the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution,
		He exposed the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi!

		The Twelfth Plenum communiqué is like a spring thunder,
		It shattered the beautiful dream of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries!

		Wei Dong: Father, the communiqué is too good!
		It shines like a lighthouse.

		Lin Laozhong: Chairman Mao points the way with his hand,
		Every word is what our working class wants to say.

		Wei Dong: The communiqué is a mobilization order,
		We will wield our swords and mount our horses.

		Lin Laozhong: Though we are "big roughnecks",
		We will hold all the power,
		We will manage education and culture,
		We will forever occupy the political stage of the superstructure!

		We will resolutely carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation,
		We will not let down Chairman Mao!

		Wei Dong: Father, we Red Guards will definitely follow Chairman Mao's words,
		We will follow the path of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers!

		(Drums and gongs grow louder and faster)

		Lin Laozhong: Son, listen—
		Wei Dong: The drums and gongs beat urgently,
		The meeting is about to begin.

		Lin Laozhong: Son, let's go—
		Forever follow Chairman Mao's revolutionary line,
		Stride forward on the path to victory!

		Both: Forever follow Chairman Mao's revolutionary line,
		Stride forward on the path to victory!

		(They sing "Sailing the Great Sea Depends on the Helmsman" and exit)

    吕洪生
    （远处传来锣鼓声，
    卫东兴高采烈地上）甲：万杆红旗呼啦啦，
    碧空万里飞彩霞，
    锣鼓声声传四海，
    党的十二中全会公报
      发表啦！
    林场召开庆祝会，
    我和我爹都参加，
    别看他今年五十八，
    紧跟毛主席，他一步
      不拉。
    你看，我爹走来啦。
    （老工人林老忠唱《大
      海航行靠舵手》上）甲：爹，你拿的啥？乙：这是一张发言稿，
    你爹登台要讲话。
    昨晚听到喜讯一夜没
      合眼，
    心潮澎湃翻浪花，
    握斧的大手写张发言
        稿，
    对毛主席说说咱林区
      工人的心里话。甲：爹，贴心话万里天空
        装不下，

    毛主席指出的道路走
        定啦！乙：孩子，你看那——甲：烟囱高高耸入云，
    厂房里??响马达。乙：孩子，你看山脚下，甲：工人宿舍排排立，
    老松树上挂着大喇
        叭。乙：你再看山坡上，甲：“东方红”拖拉机山
      上爬，
    一堆堆原木象山大。乙：孩子，你再往远处看，甲：千里林海滚绿浪，
    万顷松涛响哗哗。乙：可是在旧社会，
    天再大，地再大，
    咱工人没有一点出路
        啊！
    橡子面团难糊口，
    披着麻袋片度冬夏。

        “剥削有功”，
    要让工人农民重新当
      牛马。甲：他是美帝苏修的代理
      人，

      的天下。乙：毛主席，真伟大！
    亲自发动文化大革
      命，
    把刘少奇这个叛徒、
      内奸、工贼揪出来
      啦！

      雷，
    把帝修反的美梦炸碎
      啦！甲：爹，全会公报太好
      啦！
    光芒四射象灯塔。乙：毛主席挥手指航向，
    句句说的是咱工人阶
      级的心里话。甲：全会公报是动员令，
    咱扬刀挥戈上战马。乙：别看咱们是“大老粗”，
    一切大权咱们掌下，
    管教育，管文化，
    上层建筑的政治舞台
      咱们永远占领啦！
    坚决搞好斗、批、改，
    决不辜负毛主席他老
      人家。甲：爹，咱红卫兵坚决听
      毛主席的话，
    与工农兵相结合的道
        路走定啦！
      （锣鼓声近、急）乙：孩子，你听——甲：锣鼓咚咚响声急，
    大会就要开始啦。乙：孩子，走——
    永远沿着毛主席的革
      命路线走，
    胜利路上大步跨！合：永远沿着毛主席的革
      命路线走，
    胜利路上大步跨！

      舵手》下）
