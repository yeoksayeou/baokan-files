The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants stationed at the Shaoshan School has organized revolutionary teachers and students to seriously study Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice, significantly raising the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad masses of teachers and students.

A Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Changsha, dated November 27, reports: The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants stationed at the Shaoshan School has, in leading the school's struggle, criticism, and reform, earnestly conducted revolutionary tradition education for teachers and students, significantly raising the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary teachers and students.

After the great leader Chairman Mao issued the directive that "in the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants," the poor and lower-middle peasants of Shaoshan, with a glorious revolutionary tradition, sent eleven comrades to form the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team and entered the Shaoshan School in early October. Over the past month, they have actively implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, combining with the active elements among the students, teachers, and workers of the school who are determined to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end, and have launched a high tide of struggle, criticism, and reform.

Shaoshan is the place where the red sun rose, with a glorious revolutionary tradition. The great leader Chairman Mao personally ignited the revolutionary flames of Shaoshan and led the people of Shaoshan in decades of revolutionary struggle. This is the best classroom for conducting revolutionary tradition education for teachers and students.

The Shaoshan School has a middle school department and a primary school department, and this year it enrolled more than 220 new students in high school and junior high school, with more than 95% being children of poor and lower-middle peasants. The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants believes that to cultivate successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, students must be educated to be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, organized to seriously study Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice, and given revolutionary tradition education to establish a worldview of completely and thoroughly serving the people. Therefore, after these new students entered the school, the propaganda team organized them to set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The first lesson was on Mao Zedong Thought and revolutionary tradition education, organizing students to study Chairman Mao's latest directives, recounting Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice, and his affectionate care for the younger generation. In the early days of liberation, Chairman Mao personally inscribed the golden words "Shaoshan School" for this school; in 1959, when Chairman Mao returned to Shaoshan, he personally inspected the Shaoshan School and took a group photo with the revolutionary teachers and students. After the propaganda team and revolutionary teachers gave a detailed introduction to the students, it greatly inspired the revolutionary teachers and students' deep proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao. They said, "It is because of Chairman Mao that we have today. Being able to study in the place where the red sun rises is the greatest happiness in the life of us, the children of poor and lower-middle peasants. This happiness is given to us by Chairman Mao!"

The first activity organized by the propaganda team for the students was to lead them to visit Chairman Mao's former residence and the exhibition hall of Chairman Mao's former residence to learn about Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice. The students came to the bedroom where Chairman Mao once lived, the land where he worked, the tools he used, and the rooms where he held revolutionary meetings, listening to the detailed explanations of the guides, and received profound education. Many students, upon seeing the photos of the six martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the revolution in the exhibition hall of Chairman Mao's former residence, were moved to tears. They read aloud Chairman Mao's teachings: "Tens of thousands of martyrs have sacrificed their lives for the people's interests ahead of us. Let us hold high their banner and march forward on their blood-stained path!" They deeply realized that the victory of the revolution came at a great cost, and we must carry forward the revolutionary tradition, defend the dictatorship of the proletariat, and strive for greater victories.

In conducting revolutionary tradition education, the propaganda team also organized teachers and students to participate in collective productive labor, invited old poor peasants to tell their family histories and village histories, and had meals with the poor and lower-middle peasants to conduct class education. The teachers and students listened to the old poor peasants of the Tiepi Brigade, such as Hu Youyi, recount their bitter experiences of being hired laborers and begging for rice, suffering immense oppression and exploitation by the landlord class in the old society. They hated the evil old society even more and felt the sweetness of the new society. They said, "We will never forget the Communist Party for our liberation, and we will never forget Chairman Mao for our happiness. Chairman Mao is our great savior!"

Through revolutionary tradition education and class education, the broad revolutionary teachers and students became even more loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They went to Chairman Mao's former residence to take an oath, expressing their determination to inherit and carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition of the people of Shaoshan, follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, and forever combine with the workers, peasants, and soldiers to become reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Recently, they studied the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, received great inspiration, and actively participated in the school's struggle, criticism, and reform, determined to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end.

    用伟大的毛泽东思想哺育革命后代
    驻韶山学校贫下中农毛泽东思想宣传队，组织革命师生认真学习毛主席的伟大革命实践，极大地提高了广大师生的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟
    新华社长沙二十七日电　进驻韶山学校的贫下中农毛泽东思想宣传队，在领导学校的斗、批、改中，认真对师生进行革命传统教育，极大地提高了广大革命师生的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。
    伟大领袖毛主席发出“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校”的最新指示以后，具有光荣革命传统的韶山贫下中农，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚，派出十一名贫下中农，组成毛泽东思想宣传队，在十月上旬进驻韶山学校。一个多月来，他们积极贯彻毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，同学校的学生、教员、工人中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子结合起来，掀起了斗、批、改的高潮。
    韶山是红太阳升起的地方，有着光荣的革命传统。伟大领袖毛主席亲自点燃了韶山的革命烈火，领导韶山人民进行了几十年的革命斗争。这里是对师生进行革命传统教育的最好课堂。
    韶山学校有中学部和小学部，今年新招收了高、初中生二百二十多名，百分之九十五以上是贫下中农子弟。贫下中农毛泽东思想宣传队认为，要把学生培养成无产阶级革命事业的接班人，必须教育学生无限忠于毛主席，用毛泽东思想武装他们的头脑，组织他们认真学习毛主席的伟大革命实践，对他们进行革命传统教育，使他们树立完全彻底为人民服务的世界观。于是，在这批新生进校以后，贫下中农宣传队就组织他们分别办起了毛泽东思想学习班。上的第一课就是毛泽东思想和革命传统教育课，组织学生学习毛主席的最新指示，讲述毛主席的伟大革命实践以及毛主席对青年一代的亲切关怀。解放初期，毛主席亲自为本校题了金光闪闪的“韶山学校”四个大字；一九五九年，毛主席回韶山时亲自到韶山学校视察，并和革命师生一起摄影。贫下中农宣传队和革命教师向学生作了详细介绍后，大大激发了革命师生对毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情。他们说，“有了毛主席，才有我们的今天。我们能到红太阳升起的地方学习，这是我们贫下中农子弟一生最大的幸福，这幸福是毛主席给我们的！”
    贫下中农宣传队组织学生的第一个活动，就是带领他们到毛主席旧居和毛主席旧居陈列馆瞻仰，学习毛泽东思想和毛主席的伟大革命实践。学生们来到毛主席曾经住过的卧室里、劳动过的土地上、使用过的农具旁、召开过革命会议的房间里，听取讲解员的详细介绍，受到了深刻的教育。许多学生在毛主席旧居陈列馆看到毛主席家中为革命英勇牺牲的六位烈士的照片，激动得热泪盈眶。他们齐声朗读毛主席的教导：“成千成万的先烈，为着人民的利益，在我们的前头英勇地牺牲了，让我们高举起他们的旗帜，踏着他们的血迹前进吧！”他们深深认识到，革命的胜利来之不易，我们必须发扬革命传统，保卫无产阶级专政，争取更大的胜利。
    在进行革命传统教育中，贫下中农宣传队还组织师生参加集体生产劳动，请老贫农讲家史、村史，和贫下中农一起吃忆苦饭，进行阶级教育。师生们听了铁皮大队老贫农胡友益等讲的在旧社会做长工、讨米，受尽地主阶级压迫和剥削的惨痛遭遇，更加痛恨万恶的旧社会，更觉新社会的甜。他们说：“翻身不忘共产党，幸福不忘毛主席。毛主席是我们贫下中农的大救星！”
    通过革命传统教育和阶级教育，广大革命师生更加忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他们纷纷到毛主席旧居前宣誓，表示一定继承和发扬韶山人民光荣的革命传统，遵照毛主席的伟大教导，永远与工农兵相结合，做无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。
    最近，他们学习了党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报，受到极大鼓舞，更加积极地投入学校的斗、批、改，决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底。
