Great Leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "A large number of cadres going down to labor is a good opportunity for them to learn anew. Except for the elderly, weak, sick, and disabled, all should do so. Cadres in office should also go down to labor in batches." The changes that occurred among the office staff of Qidun Iron Mine in Xingtai, Hebei, during their labor downshift vividly illustrate that Chairman Mao's brilliant directive is the fundamental way to achieve the revolutionization of offices and the ideological revolutionization of cadres, and is a long-term strategy to prevent revisionism. From University Student to Primary School Student

One day, while cadre Li Weicheng was enthusiastically pushing a mine car on the slideway, it suddenly derailed and couldn't be put back on track. Just as he was feeling quite anxious, veteran worker Liang Rufen came over. Calmly, he picked up an iron bar, placed a stone underneath, and with a few leverages, the mine car obediently returned to the track.

During the labor downshift, Li Weicheng thought to himself, "I've studied mining for eight years, read piles of technical books, and worked as a technical officer in the mine for six or seven years. In theory, I'm better than the workers; in practice, workers have to follow my drawings. There's nothing much to learn from labor downshift, it's just an experience of life." So, although he was in the workshop, he still maintained the attitude of a technical officer, thinking about design and drawing plans.

Today's incident with the derailed mine car gave him a vivid lesson. From then on, he made a firm resolution to put down his university student's airs and appear everywhere with the attitude of a primary school student. When pushing mine cars on the slideway, because the cars ran fast and were hard to control, he seriously learned from the workers. To learn how to control the cars, he fell several times but finally mastered four or five methods the workers had created through practice. To better learn from the workers, he insisted on eating, living, working, and studying with them. He often sought out veteran workers for heart-to-heart talks, solicited their opinions, and humbly learned from their practical experiences. The workers warmly praised him, saying, "Li Weicheng, this university student, has become a primary school student."

From "Director Jia" to "Old Jia"

"I've been laboring downshift for over two months, traded in the title of 'union director' for 'Old Jia' and 'Five Increase.'" Downshifted cadre Jia Wuzeng considered this to be one of his major gains from working in the workshop.

Jia Wuzeng originally served as the union director of the anti-revisionism workshop. Due to long-term poisoning by the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, he gradually developed the idea of being an official and a lord. Usually, workers called him "Director Jia." Occasionally, someone called him "Old Jia" or "Five Increase," but he found it unpleasant, though he didn't say it out loud, he wasn't happy about it.

This time, he was downshifted to the third team of the anti-revisionism workshop. After over two months of labor, his thoughts and feelings underwent significant changes. He ate, lived, studied, and labored with the workers, truly fighting alongside the worker masses. The workers treated him as an ordinary worker, sharing their hearts with him, and he often had heart-to-heart talks with the workers, listening to their opinions and criticisms. Now, the workers affectionately call him "Old Jia" and "Five Increase." Recently, the revolutionary committee convened a meeting to discuss the downshifted office staff, and Jia Wuzeng deeply felt, "From liking workers to call me 'Director Jia' to liking them to call me 'Old Jia' and 'Five Increase,' this is not just a change in habit, but more importantly, a change in thoughts and feelings. I didn't just lose the title of 'union director,' but also the political dust of being detached from the masses; what I gained is not just the affectionate nickname 'Old Jia' and 'Five Increase,' but the class feelings of the working people."

    灵魂深处的变化
    ——河北邢台綦村铁矿干部下放劳动的收获
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会，除老弱病残者外都应这样做。在职干部也应分批下放劳动。”河北邢台綦村铁矿科室人员在下放劳动中发生的变化，雄辩地说明了毛主席的光辉指示，是实现机关革命化和干部思想革命化的根本途径，是反修、防修的百年大计。从大学生到小学生
    一天，下放干部李维成正兴致勃勃地推着矿车在滑行道上迅跑，突然车掉道了，怎么弄也上不了道。正当他十分焦急的时刻，老工人梁如彬走过来了，他不慌不忙地拿起一根铁杠，垫上一块石头，只撬了几撬，矿车就乖乖地上了道。
    在下放劳动的时候，李维成心想，自己前后学了八年采矿专业，读过成堆的技术书籍，来矿担任技术员也有六、七年了。讲理论，比工人高；论实践，工人得照自己制的图纸去办，下放劳动也没什么可学的，只不过是体验体验生活罢了。因此，他虽然身在车间，架子还是技术员，心里想的是搞设计、制图纸。
    今天，矿车掉道这件事，给他上了生动的一课。打这以后，他痛下决心，放下大学生的架子，处处以小学生的姿态出现。在滑行道上推矿车，由于矿车跑的猛，怎么也压不住，他就认真地向工人学习。为了学压车，他曾经几次挨摔，终于学会了工人从实践中创造出来的四、五种压车方法。为了更好地向工人学习，他坚持与工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习。他还经常找老工人谈心，征求工人的意见，虚心学习老矿工的实践经验。矿工们热情地称赞说：“李维成这个大学生，变成小学生了。”
    从“贾主任”到“老贾”
    “我下放劳动两个多月，丢掉了个‘工会主任’，换来了个‘老贾’、‘五增’。”下放干部贾五增认为这是他下车间劳动后的一大收获。
    贾五增，原来担任反修车间工会主任。由于长期受叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇反革命修正主义路线的毒害，渐渐滋长了做官当老爷的思想。平时工人们都喊他“贾主任”，偶尔有人喊他“老贾”、“五增”，他却感到很刺耳，嘴里不说，心里不痛快。
    这次他下放到反修车间第三连，经过两个多月的劳动，思想感情发生了很大变化。他和工人同吃、同住、同学习、同劳动，真正和工人群众战斗在一起了。工人们把他看成是一个普通工人，有什么心里话，都对他讲，他也常和工人谈心，听取工人的意见和批评。现在，工人们都亲切地喊他“老贾”、“五增”。最近，矿革委会召集了一次下放科室人员的座谈会，贾五增深有感触地说：“从喜欢听工人喊我‘贾主任’，到喜欢听工人喊我‘老贾’、‘五增’，这不光是习惯的变化，更重要的是思想感情的变化。我丢掉的不是‘工会主任’这个称号，而是脱离群众的政治灰尘；得来的不只是个‘老贾’、‘五增’的亲热称呼，而是劳动人民的阶级感情。”　（新华社稿，本报略有删节）
