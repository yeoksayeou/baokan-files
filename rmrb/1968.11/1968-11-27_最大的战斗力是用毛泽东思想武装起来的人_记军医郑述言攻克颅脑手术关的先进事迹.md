The best weapon is Mao Zedong Thought, and the greatest combat power is people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. A doctor from Leshan County, Sichuan Province, who had only studied three months of cranial trauma medical techniques, overcame the seemingly mysterious barrier of cranial surgery with his revolutionary enthusiasm to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. He has repeatedly performed miracles of bringing the dead back to life.

This doctor, who is deeply loved by the workers, peasants, and soldiers, is Military Doctor Zheng Shuyan of the 786th Hospital of the Chengdu Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, an active promoter of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

Cranial surgery requires a high level of technical skill and good equipment. However, this surgeon has successfully completed the task of saving lives and aiding the injured under the difficult conditions of lacking experience and equipment. Since last July, he has treated more than forty workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and soldiers with cranial injuries. He has performed high-difficulty surgeries on more than thirty people with severe injuries such as cranial fractures, intracranial hematomas, intracranial tumors, and brain prolapse, saving the majority of the injured from the brink of death.

Mao Zedong Thought Inspires Him to Enter a New Battle

Zheng Shuyan's first solo cranial surgery was in July of last year. The patient was a nine-year-old boy from Leshan Regional Hospital. The boy, a worker's son, fell from a high place, fracturing the right side of his temporal bone, with bone fragments penetrating the brain; the right side of his brain, which controls the opposite side's movement, suffered severe contusion and laceration, causing the boy to be paralyzed on the left side of his body.

The hospital had no cranial surgeon, so they requested a military doctor for treatment. The boy's father, seeing the military doctor, excitedly said to Zheng Shuyan, "Comrade soldier, now everything depends on you!" Zheng Shuyan, however, did not dare to speak. Although he had been a military doctor for nearly twenty years, he had only assisted in two cranial surgeries and lacked independent clinical experience. He thought: If I can't cure him, I won't be able to bear the responsibility!

The boy's father, as if guessing the doctor's thoughts, sincerely said to Zheng Shuyan, "Comrade! As long as you do your best, even if something happens to the child, I won't blame you." The worker's words were few, but Zheng Shuyan felt their weight.

"Comrade White, with his spirit of selflessness and dedication, showed extreme responsibility to his work and extreme enthusiasm for his comrades and the people. Every Communist Party member should learn from him."

Zheng Shuyan thought: Chairman Mao wants us to learn from Dr. White. The child's father asks me to do my best to save his son's life. As a military doctor and a Communist Party member, at this critical moment when the working people urgently need my help to relieve their suffering, can I stand by and do nothing?

Selflessness leads to fearlessness. This military doctor cast aside his personal thoughts and bravely picked up the scalpel. After cutting open the scalp, he found that the child's condition was more serious than he had initially judged: he had to remove bone fragments from deep within the child's brain and repair the damaged dura mater.

In the scorching summer of southwestern Sichuan, the heat was unbearable. Zheng Shuyan, performing his first solo craniotomy, was already tense; now facing unexpected new situations, his face flushed, his heart pounded, and his body sweated profusely. Who knew what more complex problems might arise next! But confidence comes from determination. He must save this child! A strong will made him calm and composed in the face of difficulties, filled with the confidence of victory.

Zheng Shuyan steadied himself and, after a five-hour intense battle, successfully completed his first cranial surgery.

After the surgery, the child's limb function gradually returned to normal, and he was lively and lovable. The child's father said many words of thanks to the military doctor. Zheng Shuyan said, "You don't need to thank me, thank Chairman Mao."

Mao Zedong Thought Guides the Medical Process

In September of last year, an elderly poor peasant participating in road construction was struck by a falling rock, causing a severe head injury. He was in a deep coma, with a fractured right temporal bone, dilated right pupil, and right upper limb paralysis, showing symptoms and signs of acute brain pressure. Generally, intracranial hematomas manifest as dilated pupils and paralysis on the opposite side. However, this patient had dilated pupils and paralysis on the same side, making it difficult to accurately diagnose the lesion. Zheng Shuyan thought, if this were in a large hospital with cerebral angiography equipment, the location and extent of the lesion could be determined, allowing for accurate diagnosis and timely treatment. But the current situation lacked this condition, and making a judgment based solely on symptoms could easily lead to a wrong diagnosis and serious consequences. What should he do? Should he watch the elderly poor peasant die, or should he find a way to overcome the lack of angiography equipment?

"Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor; the decisive factor is people, not things." Chairman Mao's teachings dispelled the fog in Zheng Shuyan's mind. He decided to seek new solutions from the treasure trove of Mao Zedong Thought.

Following Chairman Mao's teachings on looking at problems from the essential and mainstream aspects, Zheng Shuyan conducted a detailed examination and analysis of the elderly poor peasant's condition. He believed that the dilated pupils on the same side and other symptoms indicating intracranial bleeding were the essential and mainstream aspects. Based on this analysis, he performed a craniotomy on the right side of the patient's head. The operation proved to be completely correct. After treatment, the elderly poor peasant's life was saved. This made Zheng Shuyan realize that whether a patient can be cured depends on whether proletarian politics are emphasized and whether Mao Zedong Thought guides the entire medical process. As long as the relationship between people and things is correctly handled, disadvantages can be turned into advantages, and miracles can be created.

Mao Zedong Thought Makes Him Fearless

People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not afraid of bourgeois "authorities." Zheng Shuyan once, in a consultation, overturned the diagnosis made by an "authority" from a certain hospital for a severely head-injured worker, saving the patient's life. The story is as follows:

One evening in November of last year, Zheng Shuyan was invited by a certain hospital to rescue a worker with severe cranial injuries. When he arrived at the hospital, the consultation had already ended, and the conclusion was that the patient had a "skull base fracture" and was beyond rescue. He reviewed the medical records, listened to the introduction of the condition, and personally conducted a thorough examination of the patient, determining that it was an "intracranial hematoma." He advocated immediate surgery to save the life of this class brother.

This led to a disagreement between the two parties. Initially, Zheng Shuyan had some reservations: Should he insist on his opinion in front of these "authorities"?

The moment this thought flashed through Zheng Shuyan's mind, he immediately felt that it was an enemy of upholding the truth. Because, based on the other party's technical level, making a correct diagnosis was entirely possible. But they were afraid to take risks, which could lead to them stubbornly insisting that an "intracranial hematoma" was a "skull base fracture," disregarding the patient's life or death. This was a bourgeois medical attitude. The struggle before him was a struggle between the proletarian medical line and the bourgeois medical line. "A thorough materialist is fearless." To defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary medical line, he must not be swayed by the size of the hospital, the seniority of the personnel, or the number of people; he must not avoid contradictions or abandon principles. Through presenting facts and reasoning, everyone finally agreed to perform surgery on the patient.

Zheng Shuyan and his assistants took on the heavy responsibility of this surgery. He felt that this was not just a technical battle but also a political one. He was determined to use this battle to bring glory to Mao Zedong Thought and to show spirit for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. After four hours of rescue, he finally saved the life of this dying comrade worker.

    最大的战斗力是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人
    ——记军医郑述言攻克颅脑手术关的先进事迹
    最好的武器是毛泽东思想，最大的战斗力是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人。四川省乐山县一位只学过三个月颅脑外伤医疗技术的医生，凭着他全心全意为工农兵服务的革命热忱，攻克了被某些人看得相当神秘的颅脑手术关，屡创起死回生的奇迹。
    这位深受工农兵欢迎的医生，就是解放军成都部队活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子、七八六一部队医院军医郑述言。
    颅脑外科要求有较高的技术水平和较好的设备。可是这位外科医生却在经验不足、设备不全的困难情况下，出色地完成了救死扶伤的任务。自去年七月以来，他先后诊治过四十多名颅脑伤病的工人、贫下中农和解放军战士，给颅骨骨折、颅内血肿、颅内肿瘤和脑脱出等严重伤病的三十多人作了难度较高的手术，为绝大多数伤病员从死亡线上夺回了生命。
    毛泽东思想鼓舞他投入新的战斗
    郑述言第一次单独作颅脑手术，是在去年七月。伤员是乐山专区医院收治的一名九岁男孩。这个工人的儿子从高处跌下来，摔破了头部右侧的颞骨，骨片凹陷，有的穿入脑内；右侧大脑主管对侧运动的区域遭受严重挫裂伤，孩子陷于左侧半身不遂状态。
    这所医院没有颅脑外科医生，他们要求部队派医生治疗。孩子的父亲看到来了个军医，激动地对郑述言说：“解放军同志啊！现在一切都指望你了。”郑述言却没敢作声。他虽然在部队里当了近二十年军医，可是仅仅给别人当过两次颅脑手术的助手，还缺乏单独的临床实践经验。他想：如果治不好，责任担当不起啊！
    孩子的父亲仿佛猜透了军医的心事，他诚恳地对郑述言说：“同志！只要你尽了最大的努力，就是娃娃有个三长两短，我也不会埋怨你。”工人的话不多，但郑述言感到了它的份量。
    “白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。每个共产党员都要学习他。”
    郑述言心想：毛主席要我们学习白求恩医生，孩子的父亲叫我尽最大的努力来救治他儿子的伤病，作为一个人民军医、共产党员，在劳动群众迫切需要我帮助他们解除疾苦的关键时刻，我能见死不救吗？
    无私才能无畏。这位军医抛弃了私心杂念，勇敢地拿起了手术刀。切开头皮后，发现孩子的伤情比他事先判断的更严重：他必须从病孩脑髓深处拔出骨片，修补缺损的硬脑膜。
    盛夏的川南，炎热逼人。郑述言初次单独作开颅手术，心情本来就紧张；这时遇到了意外的新情况，更是脸发烧，心直跳，浑身出汗。谁知道下一步还会出现什么更复杂的问题啊！但是，信心是从决心来的。一定要挽救这孩子！坚强的意志使他在困难面前从容镇定，充满了必胜的信心。
    郑述言沉住气，经过连续五个小时的紧张战斗，终于成功地结束了他的第一次颅脑手术。
    手术后，孩子的肢体功能逐渐复常，活蹦乱跳的，逗人喜欢。孩子的父亲对军医说了许多感谢的话。郑述言说：“你不要感谢我，要感谢毛主席。”
    毛泽东思想统帅医疗过程
    去年九月，有个参加筑路的老贫农被塌方石砸伤了头部，深度昏迷，右侧颞骨折裂，右侧瞳孔散大，右上肢瘫痪，呈现了急性脑受压的症状和体征。一般颅内血肿多表现为同侧瞳孔散大，对侧肢体偏瘫。而这个伤员瞳孔散大和肢体偏瘫都表现在一侧，这种特殊情况，给病变的确诊增加了困难。郑述言心想，如果是在大医院，有脑血管造影设备，确定病变的部位和范围，就可以对伤员作准确的诊断和及时的治疗。可是眼前没有这个条件，单从症状作判断很可能开错刀，造成严重后果。怎么办？是看着这个老贫农死去？还是想方设法克服缺乏造影设备的困难呢？
    “武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。”毛主席的教导拨开了郑述言心头的迷雾。他决心要从毛泽东思想的宝库里去寻找新的解决办法。
    根据毛主席关于看问题要抓本质方面、主流方面的教导，郑述言对老贫农的伤情作了详细的检查和分析，认为同侧瞳孔散大和其他表明颅内出血的症状，是本质方面、主流方面的东西。按照这个分析得出的结论，他在病人头部右侧作了开颅手术。事实证明，判断完全正确。经过治疗，这个老贫农的生命得救了。这使郑述言认识到，能不能治好病，关键在于是否突出无产阶级政治，是否用毛泽东思想统帅整个医疗过程。只要正确对待人和物的关系，就能变劣势为优势，创造出人间奇迹。
    毛泽东思想使他无所畏惧
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是不怕资产阶级“权威”的。郑述言曾经在一次会诊中，推翻了某医院的“权威”给一位头部重伤的工人所作的诊断，挽救了伤员的生命。事情是这样的：
    去年十一月的一天晚上，郑述言应某医院的邀请，前往抢救一名颅脑重伤的工人。他到这所医院时，会诊已经结束，结论是伤员“颅底骨折”，已无法挽救。他看了病历记载，听了病情介绍，又亲自为伤员作了认真的检查，断定为“颅内血肿”，主张立即作手术，抢救这个阶级兄弟的生命。
    这引起了双方意见的分歧。起初，郑述言有些顾虑：在这些“权威”面前，应当坚持自己的意见吗？
    郑述言这个念头刚刚一闪，他立即觉得这是坚持真理的大敌。因为，按对方的技术水平，作出正确的诊断是完全可能的。但他们怕冒风险，这就有可能硬把“颅内血肿”说成“颅底骨折”，置伤员死活于不顾。这是一种资产阶级的医疗态度。眼前的这场斗争，是无产阶级的医疗路线同资产阶级的医疗路线的斗争。“彻底的唯物主义者是无所畏惧的”。为了捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命医疗路线，决不能以医院的大小，资格的新老和人数的多少左右自己的思想；更不能回避矛盾，放弃原则。通过摆事实，讲道理，大家最后还是确定给这个伤员进行手术治疗。
    郑述言和他的助手毅然把这次手术的重担挑了起来。他觉得，这不仅是一场技术仗，更是一场政治仗。他决心在这场斗争中为毛泽东思想增光，为毛主席的革命路线争气。经过四个小时的抢救，他终于把这个垂死的工人同志救活了。　本报记者
