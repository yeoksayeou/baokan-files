West German Reactionary Chancellor Gets Publicly Slapped

The West German government, which has consistently pursued a militaristic expansionist policy, saw its chancellor, Kiesinger, publicly humiliated during a rally in West Berlin on November 7. The incident left him in a state of disarray.

West Berlin has never been part of West Germany. However, the ruling Christian Democratic Union, under the protection of U.S. imperialism, recently held a provocative annual meeting there. Kiesinger, a former Nazi party member, sat confidently on the stage. On November 7, as the meeting was concluding, a young woman named Beate Klarsfeld, pushed through the heavily guarded venue, rushed onto the stage, and slapped Kiesinger across the face. The blow was so forceful that he jumped from his seat. The scene erupted into chaos, with delegates shouting and creating a spectacle. Security guards quickly apprehended the young woman.

A few hours later, the reactionary authorities in West Berlin hastily convened an "emergency court" to try the case. In court, Beate Klarsfeld solemnly declared that her action was intended to remind everyone of Kiesinger's shameful history as a Nazi party member.

　　西德反动总理当众挨揍
    一贯推行军国主义扩张政策的西德政府总理基辛格，七日在西柏林的一次集会上当众挨揍，狼狈不堪。
    西柏林从来不是西德的一部分，但是西德的执政党基督教民主联盟最近在美帝的庇护下，又在西柏林挑衅性地召开年会，曾经是希特勒纳粹党徒的基辛格也大模大样地坐在主席台上。七日，当这个年会举行闭幕式时，一位名叫比特·克拉斯费尔特的女青年穿过警卫森严的会场，跳上主席台给了基辛格一记响亮的耳光，打得他从座位上蹦了起来。一时会场大哗。代表们纷纷站起来大叫大嚷，丑态百出。保镖们赶忙把这个女青年抓了起来。
    几小时后，西柏林反动当局匆忙召集了一个“临时法庭”来审理这个案件。比特·克拉斯费尔特在法庭上严正表示，她采取这个举动，是为了提醒大家注意基辛格当年是纳粹党徒的丑恶历史。
