We are extremely excited to have watched the Albanian film "Broad Horizons." This film truly reflects the heroic Albanian people, under the wise leadership of the great Marxist-Leninist Enver Hoxha, building socialism through self-reliance and deeply and continuously carrying out the revolutionary movement. It passionately praises the selfless and public-spirited Albanian working class hero—port crane operator Uran.

Represented by Uran, the Albanian working class, in the great socialist revolution and socialist construction, works selflessly, diligently, and fearlessly faces difficulties and dares to fight. In the film, Uran and his comrades bravely fight against the storm and rain to protect state property, which deeply moved and educated us. The state's property was seriously threatened by the storm and rain, and the floating crane ship was in imminent danger of being destroyed. The storm and rain were the order for battle. Where the wind and waves were strongest, where it was most dangerous, Uran and his comrades fought there. In the fierce battle against the storm and rain, they were determined to protect state property, completely disregarding their own safety. When we saw these moving scenes in the film, we couldn't help but wish to immediately fly to their side and fight alongside the heroic Albanian working class to overcome the storm and waves. No matter how the storm raged or the rain poured, it could not shake the determination of the heroic Albanian working class to be loyal to the party, loyal to the motherland, and to defend state property to the death. Finally, the storm and rain were conquered by the heroic Uran and his comrades, and the hundred-ton floating crane was saved! Uran and his comrades are truly heroes!

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "'Within the seas, there are friends; across the sky, neighbors are close.' Although China and Albania are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, our hearts are united."

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in our Sino-Albanian Friendship Commune, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production," and are both revolutionary vanguards and production models. Our revolutionary actions have received the support and help of the heroic Albanian embassy staff in China. The embassy staff often come to our commune to work with us and encourage us to follow the great leader Chairman Mao, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. This year, our commune experienced a severe drought unprecedented in decades. We learned from the revolutionary spirit of the heroic Albanian people in fighting for grain from the mountains and overcame the drought to achieve a bumper harvest this year. Currently, we, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, are implementing the battle call issued by the Party's Eighth Plenum of the Twelfth Central Committee, determined to seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and strive to achieve outstanding results to present to the Ninth National Congress of the Communist Party of China! To report good news to our most intimate Albanian comrades!

    我们的心是连在一起的
    北京中阿友好人民公社贫下中农　赵琦　赵华　左军
    我们非常兴奋地观看了阿尔巴尼亚故事片《广阔的地平线》。这部影片，真实地反映了英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在伟大的马克思列宁主义者恩维尔·霍查同志的英明领导下，自力更生地建设社会主义，深入持续地开展革命化运动的斗争生活，热情地歌颂了大公无私、舍己为公的阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级的英雄人物——海港吊车司机乌拉恩。
    以乌拉恩为代表的阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级，在伟大的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中，忘我劳动，辛勤工作，藐视困难，敢于斗争。影片中乌拉恩和他的战友们，奋不顾身，和暴风雨搏斗，保护国家财产的英雄事迹，使我们深受感动，深受教育。国家的财产受到了狂风暴雨的严重威胁，浮吊船随时都有被击毁的危险。狂风暴雨就是战斗动员令，哪里风浪大，哪里最危险，乌拉恩和他的战友们就战斗在哪里。在与狂风暴雨短兵相接的搏斗中，他们一心要保卫国家财产，把个人安危早已抛到九霄云外。当我们看到影片中这些动人场面的时候，真是恨不得立刻就飞到他们身旁，和英雄的阿尔巴尼亚工人老大哥一起战胜狂风恶浪。狂风任你刮，暴雨任你打，丝毫也动摇不了英雄的阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级忠于党，忠于祖国，誓死保卫国家财产的决心。狂风暴雨终于被英雄的乌拉恩和他的战友们征服了，百吨浮吊脱险了！乌拉恩和他的战友们真是好样的！
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“‘海内存知己，天涯若比邻’。中阿两国远隔千山万水，我们的心是连在一起的。”
    我们中阿友好公社的广大贫下中农，在无产阶级文化大革命中，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，既做抓革命的闯将，又当促生产的模范。我们的革命行动，得到英雄的阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使馆同志们的支持和帮助，大使馆的同志经常到我们公社和我们一起劳动，并鼓励我们紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，全面落实毛主席一系列最新指示，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。今年，我们公社遭遇到了几十年来未有的干旱，我们学习英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民向山要粮的革命精神，战胜了旱灾，夺得了今年农业生产的大丰收。当前，我们广大贫下中农正在贯彻落实党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发出的战斗号召，决心认真搞好斗、批、改，力争用最优异的成绩向中国共产党第九次全国代表大会献礼！向我们最亲密的阿尔巴尼亚战友报喜！
