Today marks the 24th anniversary of Albania's liberation. The Chinese people, who are striving for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, extend their warmest congratulations to the Albanian people with fraternal feelings.

Twenty-four years ago, the heroic Albanian people, under the leadership of the Albanian Party of Labour headed by the great leader Comrade Enver Hoxha, drove out the Italian-German fascist invaders through armed struggle, liberated their own country, established a people's government, and set a brilliant example in Europe of liberation achieved through self-reliance.

Over the past 24 years, the Albanian people have achieved brilliant victories in the struggle for socialist revolution and socialist construction, as well as in the struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and their lackeys. Albania has transformed from a poor and backward country into an advanced and strong socialist state, becoming an unshakable red fortress.

The past 24 years have been a period of victory and progress for the Albanian people on the socialist road; a period of relentless struggle against domestic and foreign class enemies, continuously consolidating and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat; a period of self-reliance, hard work, and striving for progress. The road the Albanian people have traveled over the past 24 years is a glorious, fighting, and heroic road. The Albanian people are truly a great people who stand tall and firm.

All the achievements of the Albanian people are inseparable from the wise leadership of the Albanian Party of Labour headed by the great Marxist-Leninist Comrade Enver Hoxha. The Albanian Party of Labour creatively combines the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practices of the Albanian revolution, adheres to the revolutionary line of Marxism-Leninism, insists on the dictatorship of the proletariat, and persists on the socialist road, guiding the Albanian people from one victory to another. The practice of struggle has proven that the Albanian Party of Labour is a great Marxist-Leninist party.

In recent years, under the leadership of the Albanian Party of Labour headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, the Albanian people have carried out a revolutionary movement of profound socialist significance. They have launched a vigorous class struggle, purged the filth left by the old society in the economic, political, ideological, and cultural fields, and promoted the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking. This magnificent revolutionary movement has reached a deeper stage this year. The educational revolution and worker supervision proposed by Comrade Enver Hoxha in the first half of this year have greatly enriched the content of the revolutionary movement. Due to the successful development of the revolutionary movement, the spiritual face of the Albanian people has undergone significant changes, and the country is full of a revolutionary atmosphere. This revolutionary movement is of great importance in consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist restoration, and greatly promoting the development of socialist construction. This year, the Albanian people have overcome natural disasters, overcome various difficulties, and achieved tremendous successes on the industrial and agricultural production fronts. The Chinese people are extremely happy about the double harvest of revolution and production by the Albanian brothers.

The Albanian Party of Labour and people have always held high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism, dared to confront any black winds and evil waves, and have waged an unyielding and heroic struggle against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered around the Soviet revisionist traitor clique. Not long ago, the People's Republic of Albania solemnly announced its withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact, fully demonstrating the high principle of Marxism-Leninism and the great revolutionary spirit. This bold revolutionary action has dealt a heavy blow to the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, which is in a state of internal and external difficulties, and has greatly encouraged the struggle of the Soviet, Eastern European, and world revolutionary people against modern revisionism. The Albanian Party of Labour and people, with their heroic and victorious struggle, have made outstanding contributions to the international communist movement and the revolutionary cause of the world's people.

The U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries regard socialist Albania as a thorn in their side and resort to all kinds of sabotage and threats. However, the heroic Albania stands like a giant on the European continent, unyielding, unshakable, and unbreakable by any counter-revolutionary forces. If the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and their lackeys dare to touch Albania, they will surely suffer a thorough, shameful, and irrevocable failure.

The Albanian people are the close comrades-in-arms of the Chinese people. We have always supported each other and fought shoulder to shoulder in our common revolutionary cause. The Albanian Party of Labour and people, led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, have given enthusiastic praise and support to every victory achieved by the Chinese people in their revolutionary struggle, and have given high evaluations and firm support to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country from the very beginning. This has been a great encouragement and inspiration to the Chinese people.

The revolutionary friendship between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Albania is based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and is eternal and unbreakable. No matter what happens in the world, the peoples of the two countries will stand firmly together. The delegation led by Comrade Huang Yongsheng, visiting Albania at the invitation of the Albanian people, celebrates the glorious anniversary of Albania's 24th liberation together with the Albanian people, which is a manifestation of the great friendship and unity between the two parties, two countries, two peoples, and two armies.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The revolutionary friendship between the peoples of China and Albania has been tested by fierce international class struggles. The power generated by this friendship is boundless and truly invincible. Let us, together with all the true Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary peoples of the world, unite more closely to fight shoulder to shoulder for the thorough burial of the common enemy of the world's people, U.S. imperialism, and Soviet revisionism!"

The great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, pointed out: "The brotherly and rock-solid friendship between our party, our government, and our people with the Communist Party of China, the government of China, and the people of China will last forever. Neither the vast distances nor the mountains and seas can stop us. Whether in good times or difficult times, we will always be together like brothers."

At this joyous occasion of celebrating the 24th anniversary of Albania's liberation, the Chinese people sincerely wish the brotherly Albanian people, under the leadership of the Albanian Party of Labour headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, even greater victories in the struggle for socialist revolution, socialist construction, and anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism. We are fully confident that this great socialist beacon in Europe, Albania, will shine with even more brilliant light!

    光荣的战斗的道路
    庆祝阿尔巴尼亚解放二十四周年
    今天是阿尔巴尼亚解放二十四周年。正在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的中国人民，怀着兄弟般的感情，向阿尔巴尼亚人民致以最热烈的祝贺。
    二十四年前，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民在以伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，经过武装斗争，赶走了意大利—德国法西斯侵略者，解放了自己的祖国，建立了人民的政权，在欧洲树立了一个依靠自己力量取得解放的光辉范例。
    二十四年来，阿尔巴尼亚人民在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的斗争中，在同帝国主义、现代修正主义及其走狗的斗争中，取得了辉煌的胜利，使阿尔巴尼亚从一个贫穷落后的国家变成为一个先进的坚强的社会主义国家，变成为一个不可动摇的红色堡垒。
    过去的二十四年，是阿尔巴尼亚人民沿着社会主义道路胜利前进的二十四年；是阿尔巴尼亚人民同国内外阶级敌人进行针锋相对的斗争，不断巩固和加强无产阶级专政的二十四年；是阿尔巴尼亚人民坚持自力更生的方针，艰苦奋斗，奋发图强的二十四年。阿尔巴尼亚人民二十四年来走过的道路，是光荣的道路，战斗的道路，英雄的道路。阿尔巴尼亚人民，不愧是顶天立地的伟大的人民。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民所取得的一切成就，都是同伟大的马克思列宁主义者恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的英明领导分不开的。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，创造性地把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和阿尔巴尼亚革命的具体实践相结合，坚持马克思列宁主义的革命路线，坚持无产阶级专政，坚持社会主义道路，指引着阿尔巴尼亚人民不断从胜利走向新的胜利。斗争的实践证明，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党是伟大的马克思列宁主义的政党。
    近几年来，阿尔巴尼亚人民在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，进行了具有深刻的社会主义革命意义的革命化运动。他们大力开展阶级斗争，荡滌旧社会在经济、政治、思想、文化等各个领域中遗留的污泥浊水，促进人的思想革命化。这个轰轰烈烈的革命化运动，今年发展到了一个更深入的阶段。恩维尔·霍查同志今年上半年提出的教育革命和工人阶级监督，大大丰富了革命化运动的内容。由于革命化运动的胜利开展，阿尔巴尼亚人民的精神面貌发生了显著的变化，全国各地是一片朝气蓬勃的革命景象。这个革命化运动，对于巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，具有重要意义，而且大大地推进了社会主义建设事业的发展。今年，阿尔巴尼亚人民战胜了自然灾害，克服了种种困难，在工农业生产战线上取得了巨大的成就。中国人民对阿尔巴尼亚兄弟在革命和生产上的双丰收，感到无比的高兴。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和人民，一贯高举马克思列宁主义的伟大红旗，敢于顶住任何黑风恶浪，同以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义进行了不屈不挠的英勇斗争。不久以前，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国庄严宣布退出华沙条约，充分表现了马克思列宁主义的高度原则性和大无畏的革命精神。这个果敢的革命行动，有力地打击了处于内外交困的苏修叛徒集团，大大地鼓舞了苏联、东欧和世界革命人民反对现代修正主义的斗争。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和人民，以充满英雄气概的胜利的战斗，为国际共产主义运动和世界人民革命事业作出了杰出的贡献。
    美帝、苏修和各国反动派把社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚视为眼中钉，不择手段地进行破坏和威胁。但是，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚象巨人一样屹立在欧洲大陆上，它是任何反革命力量都吓不倒、压不垮、攻不破的。美帝、苏修及其走狗如果胆敢碰一下阿尔巴尼亚，一定要遭到彻底的、可耻的、无可挽回的失败。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民是中国人民的亲密的战友。我们在共同的革命事业中，始终是互相支持、并肩战斗的。以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民，对中国人民在革命斗争中取得的每一个胜利都给予热情的赞扬和支持，特别是对于我国无产阶级文化大革命，从一开始就给予高度评价和坚决支持，这对中国人民是极大的鼓舞和激励。
    中阿两党、两国和两国人民的革命友谊，是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的，是永恒的，牢不可破的。不论世界上发生什么事情，中阿两国人民都将坚定不移地站在一起。由黄永胜同志率领的中国党政军代表团应邀访问阿尔巴尼亚，同阿尔巴尼亚人民一起欢度阿尔巴尼亚解放二十四周年的光辉节日，就是表现了我们两党、两国人民、两国政府、两国军队的这种伟大的友谊和团结。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“中阿两国人民的革命友谊，是经过激烈的国际阶级斗争考验的。这种友谊所产生的力量是无穷无尽和真正无敌的。让我们两党、两国人民同全世界真正的马克思列宁主义者、各国革命人民更紧密地团结起来，为彻底埋葬世界人民的公敌美帝、苏修而并肩战斗！”
    阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志指出：“我们党、我国政府和我国人民同中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民结成的兄弟般的、坚如磐石的友谊将万古长青。不管是迢迢万里，还是高山和海洋，都阻挡不住我们。不管在美好的日子里还是困难的日子里，我们将象亲兄弟一样永远在一起。”
    当此热烈庆祝阿尔巴尼亚解放二十四周年之际，中国人民衷心祝愿兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民在恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，在社会主义革命、社会主义建设和反帝反修的斗争中，取得更加伟大的胜利。我们完全相信，阿尔巴尼亚这盏欧洲的伟大社会主义明灯，一定会放射出更加灿烂夺目的光辉！
