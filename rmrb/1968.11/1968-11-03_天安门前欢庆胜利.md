The communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has been issued, and the whole nation is in a state of excitement, Beijing is in a state of excitement! The people of the capital flocked to Chang'an Street and Tiananmen Square throughout the night, with hearts filled with immense excitement, celebrating a great joyous event in the political life of the Chinese people, celebrating the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Millions of hearts turn towards Chairman Mao, millions of songs sing praises to the red sun. On Tiananmen Square, propaganda teams from all directions, carrying the thoughts of Mao Zedong, sing and dance joyfully.

The soldiers of the Third Team of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the Fourth Department of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army had just returned from the remote Tibetan Plateau to Beijing. As soon as they got off the train, they heard the great news of the issuance of the communiqué. The soldiers, forgetting the fatigue of their long journey, immediately joined the battle, quickly rushed to Tiananmen Square, and in a very short time, compiled programs such as "Celebrating the Issuance of the Communiqué" and propagated to the people of the capital.

The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of a certain unit of the Air Force, during their 18 days in Beijing, welcomed two great joyous days. On October 15th, they heard Mao Zedong's latest directive on "expelling the old and taking in the new" as soon as they got off the train. On November 1st, they heard the news of the issuance of the communiqué from the radio. They felt extremely happy and extremely fortunate. To celebrate this great joyous day, they immediately began to propagate, singing loudly in front of Tiananmen:

The lights in Zhongnanhai are bright, the sky is shining, Beijing City is with Chairman Mao, the soldiers are most loyal to you!

Zhang Hongxin, a new member of the propaganda team, was a Red Guard of Shanghai Electrical Machinery School two years ago. Ten years ago, the traitor Liu Shaoqi's feet trampled this school. During the Cultural Revolution, Liu Shaoqi's agent in this school ruthlessly suppressed the masses. Zhang Hongxin and his comrades fought resolutely, and under the support of Chairman Mao, finally won the victory. Today, recalling the course of the struggle, Xiao Zhang said with boundless enthusiasm: "To expose the traitor Liu Shaoqi and sweep him into the garbage heap of history is the greatest victory of the Cultural Revolution. We will resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, actively participate in the struggle to criticize Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices, and let them never rise again!"

Eighty-one Red Guard youngsters from the third year of Beijing Daytan Middle School, who are about to go to the countryside of Hequ County, Shanxi Province to settle down, are about to leave Beijing. When they heard the great news of the issuance of the communiqué, they were extremely excited. The youngsters came to the foot of Tiananmen Gate Tower and studied the communiqué word by word. They pledged their loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao: "Dear great leader Chairman Mao, we are the little red soldiers you have nurtured. We will definitely follow your great teachings, accept re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and combine with workers and peasants to forge ourselves into reliable successors who are forever loyal to you. Ten thousand words and ten thousand songs converge into the most beautiful sound in the world: wishing the great teacher, the great leader, the great commander, and the great helmsman Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!"

    天安门前欢庆胜利
    党的第八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表了，全国在沸腾，北京在沸腾！首都人民连夜涌向长安街，涌向天安门广场，怀着无比激动的心情，欢庆中国人民政治生活中的大喜事，欢庆无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。
    千万颗红心向着毛主席，千万支颂歌歌唱红太阳。在天安门广场上，一支支来自四面八方的毛泽东思想宣传队，载歌载舞，纵情欢唱。
    中国人民解放军总字四○一部队毛泽东思想宣传队第三队的战士们，刚从遥远的西藏高原返回北京。他们一下了火车，就听到公报发表的特大喜讯，战士们忘记了长途跋涉的劳累，立即投入战斗，迅速赶到天安门广场，在极短的时间内，编出《欢呼公报发表》等节目，向首都群众进行宣传。
    空军某部毛泽东思想宣传队，到北京十八天中，就迎接了两个大喜日子。十月十五日，他们一下车就听到中央人民广播电台播送毛主席“吐故纳新”的最新指示。十一月一日，他们又从广播里听到公报发表的消息。他们感到无比的高兴，感到无比的幸福。为了欢庆这个大喜的日子，他们立即进行宣传，在天安门前放声歌唱：
    中南海里灯光亮，万里长空耀眼明，北京城里毛主席，战士对您最忠诚！
    宣传队的新战士张宏鑫，两年前还是上海电机学校的红卫兵。十年前，大叛徒刘少奇的贼脚践踏过这个学校。在文化大革命中，刘少奇在这个学校的代理人疯狂镇压群众，张宏鑫和他的战友们进行了坚决的斗争，在毛主席的支持下，终于取得了胜利。今天，小张回忆起斗争的历程，无限激情地说：“揪出大叛徒刘少奇，把他扫进历史的垃圾堆，这是文化大革命的最大胜利。我们坚决听毛主席的话，积极投入批判刘少奇及其同伙的战斗，让他们永世不得翻身！”
    即将奔赴山西省河曲县农村安家落户的北京市日坛中学初中三年级的八十一名红卫兵小将，就要离开北京了。当他们听到公报发表的特大喜讯时，心情万分激动。小将们来到天安门城楼下，一字一句地学习公报。他们向伟大领袖毛主席敬献忠心：“敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，我们是您抚育的红小兵，我们一定遵循您的伟大教导，接受工农兵的再教育，与工农结合起来，把自己锻炼成永远忠于您的红色接班人。千言万语，千歌万曲汇成世界上最美好的声音：祝愿伟大的导师，伟大的领袖，伟大的统帅，伟大的舵手毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
