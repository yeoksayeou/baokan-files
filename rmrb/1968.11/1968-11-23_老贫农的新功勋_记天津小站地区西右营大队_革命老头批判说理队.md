The main force that has always struggled and fought in the countryside is the poor peasants.

The "Revolutionary Old Men Criticism and Reasoning Team" of Xiyouying Brigade, Beizhaikou Commune, Xiaozhan Area, Tianjin, is a "revolutionary vanguard" team composed of nineteen old poor peasants. These revolutionary old people have an average age of sixty-eight. In the old society, they experienced the most difficult times. In the great proletarian cultural revolution, they are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and have established new merits for defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The broad revolutionary masses praise them, saying: "Revolutionary old people are good poor peasants who are loyal to Chairman Mao." "Whoever tries to seize our power, we will fight to the end with them!"

In 1966, the storm of the great proletarian cultural revolution suddenly swept over Xiyouying Brigade. A small handful of capitalist-roaders within the old Tianjin city and district party felt their doom approaching and were in a state of panic. They manipulated some bad elements to deceive some of the masses, shifting the target of struggle and directing the spearhead at the good cadres of the poor and lower-middle peasants, the acting secretary of the Xiyouying Brigade party branch, Wang Fengchun.

Seventy-three-year-old poor peasant Liu Rukang saw these scenes and remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "Communist Party members must ask why about everything." He couldn't eat or sleep well all day. One night, he sat on the kang and pondered: The "four cleanups" in the brigade were carried out in accordance with Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Our power was seized from the counter-revolutionary rich peasant Zhang Fengqin after a fierce struggle. Fengchun listens to Chairman Mao the most and fights the hardest. He is a good cadre chosen by our poor and lower-middle peasants with one heart. Why do some people want to reverse this case? The old man thought more and more, and his heart became more and more unsettled. Chairman Mao's earnest teachings, "Never forget class struggle," immediately came to his mind. He realized that there must be class enemies playing tricks, so he immediately put on his shoes and walked out of the house, coming to the home of his old partner Liu Tangming, who had worked with him in the past. As soon as he entered the door, Liu Tangming greeted him, saying: "Rukang, you came just in time. I was just about to find you to discuss something." This straightforward old man, without waiting for the other to speak, said angrily: "We have knocked down the fox Zhang Fengqin and straightened our backs. How can we allow her to reverse the 'four cleanups' case and let her change the sky?!" Liu Rukang said: "Right, the sky cannot change, and the power cannot be lost! I came to find you to discuss this matter and organize everyone to fight with her!"

The second night, Liu Rukang's home was filled with nineteen old poor peasants. They read Chairman Mao's teachings word by word: "The rights obtained by the people must not be easily lost and must be defended by struggle." Everyone discussed while learning, saying: "Let's organize a 'Revolutionary Old Men Criticism and Reasoning Team.' Some said: 'Good! We should also issue a declaration, and the first item should be to defend Chairman Mao!' Some said: 'Add 'Overthrow the handful of capitalist-roaders!' Others said: 'We should also write 'Defend the achievements of the four cleanups and support our Fengchun.' 'Whoever tries to seize our power, we will fight to the end with them!'"

The establishment of the "Revolutionary Old Men Criticism and Reasoning Team" represented the wishes of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants of Xiyouying; the old revolutionaries' "declaration" expressed the voice of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants of Xiyouying. In this way, a fierce struggle led by the old poor peasants to defend the proletarian dictatorship and the achievements of the four cleanups was launched with great fervor.

The clear-cut stance and invincible spirit of the poor and lower-middle peasants frightened a small handful of class enemies. They initially wanted to use "soft" methods to dissolve this team of old poor peasant fighters. At that time, some people of unknown origin moved into the homes of the old poor peasants. As soon as they entered the door, they asked about the cold and the warmth, repeatedly saying to the old poor peasants, "Learn from you," but they did not understand the situation and only persuaded the old poor peasants, saying: "You are old, don't worry about it, rest more at home!" But they frequently went back and forth between the homes of the cadres who were removed during the four cleanups and the homes of the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. The old people saw through their tricks, and each found six or seven Red Guards, bought pens, ink, and paper with their own money, gathered under the lamp, opened the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and dictated while the Red Guards wrote. In just two days, big-character posters exposing the enemy's tricks and uncovering the class struggle in Xiyouying were posted all over the village.

The enemy's soft tricks failed in front of the old poor peasants. They then impatiently adopted hard-pressure tactics, occupying the village's loudspeaker station in one morning. The loudspeakers of the entire brigade announced the groundless "crimes" of the revolutionary cadre Wang Fengchun from morning to night, and even incited the four types of elements to "appeal if wronged, avenge if wronged," "rise up in rebellion, and redeem sins." Suddenly, the entire Xiyouying was filled with evil winds and rolling clouds. In these difficult days, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants of the Xiyouying area missed Chairman Mao so much! The nineteen revolutionary old peasants gathered at Liu Rukang's home, standing in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and solemnly swore: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We poor and lower-middle peasants vow to defend you! We vow to defend the power you gave us! We vow to defend the red mountains and rivers forever!" From then on, the old people's fighting spirit became even stronger. They reported the situation to the proletarian headquarters on one hand and, on the other hand, went to various teams to take the initiative to shoulder the two heavy burdens of revolution and production. During the day, they organized everyone to go to the fields to insist on production, and at night, they organized everyone to fight face-to-face with the class enemies.

Soon, the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao issued the instruction to "defend the achievements of the four cleanups." Under the inspiration of this wise instruction, the "Revolutionary Old Men Criticism and Reasoning Team" of Xiyouying and the broad revolutionary masses launched a swift and fierce attack on a small handful of class enemies. In early February this year, the revolutionary committee was quickly established. "To hold the power well, we will spare no effort and be content."

In the life-and-death struggle between the two classes, after a bloody battle, the old poor peasants who had defended the power were more concerned about how to hold the power well than about their own children. They cherished the revolutionary committee more than their own lives and educated and cultivated revolutionary cadres more carefully than cultivating seedlings with their own hands.

The next day after the revolutionary committee was established in Xiyouying, the nineteen old people gathered together and seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "To seize national victory is only the first step in the Long March of ten thousand li." "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the seizure of power, the consolidation of power." They deeply felt that seizing power was only the beginning of the revolution, and only by following Chairman Mao closely could they achieve victory step by step. They unanimously decided to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and wholeheartedly help the revolutionary committee grow as their most important task.

One evening, the old poor peasants heard from the radio that Chairman Mao issued the latest instruction that the great proletarian cultural revolution is essentially a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party and its leadership and the broad revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. They immediately gathered together to study. They felt in the discussion that the revolutionary committee had recently focused only on land consolidation, seedling raising, and watering during the busy production season, relaxing the fierce struggle against class enemies, and rightist thoughts began to emerge. Liu Rukang, on behalf of the old people, found the responsible person of the revolutionary committee that night and pointed out bluntly: "We must study Chairman Mao's latest instruction well! We cannot only focus on grain, cotton, and oil and not distinguish between enemies and friends; we cannot only care about eight hundred and one thousand and not care about peaceful evolution." This criticism was highly valued by the revolutionary committee, which immediately carried out a rectification study and quickly launched a campaign to take class struggle as the key link, promoting spring production. In a short time, six hidden traitors, spies, and active counter-revolutionaries were exposed, greatly enhancing the class consciousness and revolutionary spirit of the broad revolutionary masses, and making the more than two thousand mu of rice in the entire brigade transplanted with "small full" seedlings in advance.

The new situation in Xiyouying Brigade was seen by the old people, and they were happy in their hearts. But how to maintain the achievements that had been made? This problem became the old people's constant concern. Once, the old people discussed at a study meeting, studying Chairman Mao's teachings about "the whole country learning from the People's Liberation Army," recalling the "supporting agriculture" soldiers who had lived, eaten, and worked with the people for several months. These sons and daughters of the people always put proletarian politics first, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively every day. Liu Tangming, the old man, said excitedly: "The PLA does what Chairman Mao says, big or small things talk about politics, work is swift and decisive, and goes straight to the point. If we learn this family treasure, we can hold the power firmly forever, and the mountains and rivers will never change color." "Good!" Everyone said in unison, "Brother Tangming is right. We should also learn from the PLA and take the road of political construction of the team." "To hold the power well, we will spare no effort and be content."

The precious suggestions of the old poor peasants were like a strong east wind, making the poor and lower-middle peasants of Xiyouying bloom with joy. A mass movement to build the production team with Chairman Mao's military thoughts was vigorously carried out. The nineteen old poor peasants took the lead in this battle, fully demonstrating the role of the "revolutionary vanguard." With the help of the revolutionary committee, they chose two of the best class education sites. One is a large willow tree by the river south of the village, more than fifty years old. This large willow tree was a execution ground for the Japanese devils and the Kuomintang reactionaries to massacre the poor and lower-middle peasants before liberation. After liberation, it was also a place for the counter-revolutionary rich peasant Zhang Fengqin to peddle "three selfs and one package" and persecute revolutionary masses; the other is a row of six very grand houses built by Zhang Fengqin behind the village street by concealing production, private division, speculation, and extorting the blood and sweat of the peasants. These two places, one with a wooden sign "Class Education Tree" and the other with a sign "Class Education Exhibition Hall." The old poor peasants led the young people to the large willow tree and Zhang Fengqin's house, letting them listen to the old people's bitter complaints about the old society and see the enemy's loot. The young people's class consciousness was continuously improved under their education. The old people also had a deep understanding, saying: "Remembering bitterness and sweetness often is like giving young people a foundation and nutrition; fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism is like weeding and pruning the seedlings. These are the thousand-jin burdens given to us old poor peasants by Chairman Mao! This is also the eternal plan to hold the power well. We must pass it down from generation to generation!"

From the dark old society to the new society illuminated by the red sun, the several old poor peasants never forgot their savior Chairman Mao. They often said: "We several poor brothers, our lives are given by Chairman Mao. As long as we live, we will fight to defend Chairman Mao for one day!"

These revolutionary old people suffered the most and were oppressed the heaviest in the old society where people were eaten. Everyone had a tragic history of blood and tears and an account of bitterness turning into sweetness. They were all driven from Jiangsu, Shandong, Hebei, and other places to Xiyouying when they were young. The crows in the world are generally black, and they escaped from the fire pit only to fall into the tiger's mouth. At that time, not only did ninety percent of the land belong to the landlords, but it was also a nest of warlords training soldiers, bandits, and a mixture of stubborn and fake elements. The poor people always called this place a place where "geese lose their feathers." The homeless refugees who fled here were like slaves wearing shackles again, suffering even more water and fire torture of class oppression and exploitation.

Thinking of the past bitterness and looking at the present sweetness, the revolutionary old people never forgot their savior Chairman Mao. They turned their deep proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao into practical actions. They studied Chairman Mao's works diligently, and if they were illiterate, they asked the Little Red Guards to be their teachers and used the radio for guidance. They always carried "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and the "Three Articles" with them, asking literate people when they saw them. Sometimes, if they couldn't remember a sentence, they would sit up in the middle of the night and recite it until they memorized it. They said: "Mao Zedong Thought is the treasure of the revolution. We will study it until old and use it until old!"

In the struggle practice, they deeply felt that Chairman Mao's words were worth a thousand gold pieces, and each sentence was heavier than Mount Tai. They said: "If you study Chairman Mao's book and don't use it, it's like farming without sowing seeds." The revolutionary old people learned a little and used a little. They had the sun in their hearts, struggled hard for the revolution, and reached the realm of selflessness. Once, the entire brigade held a meeting to criticize the traitor Liu Shaoqi's "three selfs and one package" counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies. The old people all came to the meeting with the treasure book in their hands, except for the brigade leader Liu Rukang, who was sick in bed. When he heard the slogan "Down with Liu Shaoqi!" on his sickbed, he immediately remembered "An important task on the ideological front at present is to carry out a criticism of revisionism." The old man remembered Chairman Mao's teachings and forgot his pain, insisting on asking his son to support him to attend the meeting. His son said: "You are so sick. Tell me, and I will criticize for you." The old man anxiously said: "No! As long as there is a breath, I must personally criticize revisionism!"

Today, under the inspiration of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, the old people of the "Revolutionary Old Men Criticism and Reasoning Team" have decided to follow the great battle tasks proposed by the communiqué, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and make new contributions to the comprehensive victory of the cultural revolution.

    老贫农的新功勋
    ——记天津小站地区西右营大队“革命老头批判说理队”
    “乡村中一向苦战奋斗的主要力量是贫农。”
    天津小站地区北闸口公社西右营大队“革命老头批判说理队”，是一支由十九位老贫农组成的“革命先锋”队伍。这些革命老人平均年龄六十八岁。在旧社会他们经历过最艰苦的岁月。在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，他们无限忠于毛主席，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，为保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线建立了新的功勋。广大革命群众称赞他们说：“革命老人是忠于毛主席的好贫农。”“谁夺咱印把子，就跟谁拚到底！”
    一九六六年，无产阶级文化大革命的暴风骤雨，迅猛异常地降临到西右营大队。旧天津市、区党内一小撮走资派预感到末日来临，惊慌万状，就操纵一些坏人，蒙蔽一部分群众，转移斗争目标，把矛头指向贫下中农的好干部、西右营大队党支部代理书记王凤春。
    七十三岁的老贫农刘汝恭看到这些情景，记起毛主席的教导：“共产党员对任何事情都要问一个为什么”。他整天吃不好，睡不着。有一天夜里，他坐在炕头上反复思忖：队里的“四清”是执行了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的，咱的印把子是从反革命富农分子张凤琴手里拚死拚活夺回来的；咱凤春最听毛主席的话，斗争最坚决，是咱贫下中农一心选上来的好干部，为什么有人要翻这个案呢？老人越想心里越不平静。毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的谆谆教导立即浮上心头，他意识到一定有阶级敌人在捣鬼，于是立即登上鞋走出家门，来到过去在一起扛过活的老伙伴刘汤明家里。刚一进门，刘汤明就迎上来说：“汝恭，你来得正好，我正打算找你商量点事。”这位性情刚直的老人，没等对方答话，便气愤地说：“把张凤琴这条狐狸打翻在地，咱才挺直了腰板，说话才顶用。怎么能眼看着她翻‘四清’的案，容她变天哪！？”刘汝恭说：“对，天不能变，印把子不能丢！我就是来找您商量这件事，好把大伙组织起来跟她干！”
    第二天晚上，刘汝恭家里，坐满了十九位老贫农。他们一字一句地读着毛主席的教导：“人民得到的权利，绝不允许轻易丧失，必须用战斗来保卫。”大家边学边讨论，你一言我一语地说：“咱们组织一个‘革命老头批判说理队’吧。”有的说：“好！咱们还要发个声明，第一条就写上保卫毛主席！”有的说：“再写上打倒一小撮走资派！”还有的说：“也得写上保卫‘四清’成果，支持咱凤春。”“谁夺咱印把子，就跟谁拚到底！”
    “革命老头批判说理队”的成立，代表了西右营广大贫下中农的心愿；革命老人们的“声明”，道出了西右营广大贫下中农的心声。就这样，一场由老贫农带头，保卫无产阶级政权，保卫“四清”成果的激烈斗争，如火如荼地展开了。
    贫下中农爱憎分明的立场和所向无敌的气概，吓破了一小撮阶级敌人的胆。他们一开始就想用“软”的办法瓦解这支老贫农战斗队伍。当时，一些来历不明的人，纷纷搬到老贫农家里住。一进门，又问“寒”，又问“暖”，口口声声向老贫农“学习”，但什么情况也不了解，却一味地劝老贫农说：“年岁大啦，不要操心啦，在家多歇歇吧！”可是，他们暗地里频繁地来往于“四清”下台干部和地富反坏右分子家里。老人们看穿了他们的阴谋，分头找来六、七个红卫兵，自己掏钱买来笔、墨、纸，凑集在灯下，翻开《毛主席语录》，老人口述，红卫兵执笔，只有两天时间，揭露敌人诡计和揭开西右营阶级斗争盖子的大字报就贴满了全村。
    阶级敌人软的花招，在老贫农面前失灵了。他们又迫不及待地采取了硬压的手段，一个早上就把村里广播站占领了。全队的广播喇叭里，从早到晚，宣布着革命干部王凤春莫须有的“罪状”，还扬言要插上张凤琴这杆“红旗”，拔掉王凤春这杆“黑旗”。甚至煽动四类分子“有冤申冤，有仇报仇”，“起来造反，立功赎罪”。顿时，整个西右营妖风四起，乌云翻滚。在这艰难困苦的日子里，西右营地区的广大贫下中农是多么想念毛主席啊！十九位革命老贫农聚集到刘汝恭家里，站在毛主席像前庄严宣誓：“毛主席啊，毛主席！俺贫下中农誓死保卫您！誓死保卫您给咱的印把子！誓死保卫红色江山永不变颜色！”从此，老人的斗志更旺，一面向无产阶级司令部反映情况，一面分头来到各个小队，主动挑起革命、生产两副重担，白天组织大家下地坚持生产，夜晚组织大家与阶级敌人展开面对面的斗争。
    不久，以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部发出了“保卫四清运动成果”的指示。在这英明指示的鼓舞下，西右营的“革命老头批判说理队”和广大革命群众一起，迅速掀起了对一小撮阶级敌人的全面猛烈进攻。在今年二月初迅速成立了革命委员会。“为了掌好印把子，操尽心血也心甘”
    在两个阶级生死大搏斗中，经过浴血奋战保住了印把子的老贫农们，对如何掌好印把子，比关心自己的儿女还心切，爱护革委会胜过自己的命根子，教育培养革命干部比亲手培育秧苗还精心。
    在西右营成立革委会的第二天，十九位革命老人就凑在一起，认真学习了毛主席的教导：“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。”“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”他们深切体会到：夺取了政权仅仅是革命的开始，只有紧跟毛主席才能步步胜利。他们一致决定把紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，满腔热情地帮助革委会成长，作为自己头等重要的任务。
    有一天晚上，老贫农们从收音机里听到毛主席发出“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续”的最新指示，立即来到一起进行学习。他们在讨论中一致感到，革委会最近在生产大忙季节，只埋头抓整地、育秧、浇水，放松了狠抓阶级斗争，右倾思想开始抬头。刘汝恭代表老人们，当夜找到了革委会负责人，一针见血地指出：“我们可得好好学习毛主席的最新指示啊！不能只抓粮棉油，不分敌我友；不能只顾八百一千，不管和平演变。”这一批评引起革命委员会极大重视，立即进行了整风学习，迅速掀起了一个以阶级斗争为纲，推动春季生产的热潮。在很短的时间内，先后揪出隐藏了多年的六个叛徒、特务、现行反革命分子，大大提高了广大革命群众的阶级觉悟和革命斗志，使全大队两千多亩水稻，提前插上了“小满”秧。
    西右营大队出现的新气象，老人们看在眼里，喜在心头。但是怎样才能把已经取得的成果保持下去呢？这一问题，又成了老人们日思夜想的问题。有一次，老人们在学习会上，学习了毛主席关于“全国学人民解放军”的教导，回想起几个月来，与群众同吃同住同劳动的“支农”解放军。这些人民子弟兵处处突出无产阶级政治，天天活学活用毛主席著作。刘汤明老人激动地说：“解放军是毛主席咋说就咋做，大事小事讲政治，工作雷厉风行，一竿子插到底。咱要学会了这一套传家宝，印把子就能永远握得牢，江山就永远变不了。”“好哇！”大伙异口同声地说，“汤明大哥说的对。咱也要学习解放军，走政治建队的道路。”“为了掌好印把子，操尽心血也心甘。”
    老贫农的宝贵建议，象一股强劲的东风，吹得西右营贫下中农人人心花怒放。一个用毛主席的建军思想建设生产队的群众运动蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来了。十九位老贫农，在这场战斗中，一马当先，充分显示了“革命先锋”的作用。他们在革委会的帮助下，选择了两个最好的阶级教育阵地。一个是村南四丈河边一棵五十多年的大柳树。这棵大柳树解放前是日本鬼子和国民党反动派残杀贫下中农的刑场，解放后，又是反革命富农分子张凤琴大肆贩卖“三自一包”和打击陷害革命群众的场所；另一个是村后街张凤琴用瞒产私分、投机倒把、榨取农民血汗盖起来的六间十分排场的房子。这两个地方，一个钉上“阶级教育树”的木牌，一个挂着“阶级教育展览馆”的字样。老贫农们把年轻人领到大柳树下和张凤琴的房子里，让他们听老人们对旧社会血泪斑斑的控诉，看阶级敌人的赃物。年轻人在他们的教育下，阶级觉悟不断提高。老人们也深有体会地说：“经常忆苦思甜，这就是给青年人打根基，送营养；狠抓头脑里的斗私批修，这就是给树苗锄杂草，打枝杈。这都是毛主席给咱老贫农的千斤重担啊！这也是掌好印把子的万年大计，咱一定要祖祖辈辈担下去！”
    “毛泽东思想是革命的宝，咱要学到老，用到老”
    从暗无天日的旧社会走向红太阳照亮的新社会的十几位老贫农，时时刻刻不忘救命恩人毛主席。他们经常说：“俺这十几个苦弟兄，生命是毛主席给的，活一天，就要为保卫毛主席战斗一天！”
    这些革命老人，在吃人的旧社会，受苦最深，受压迫最重，人人都有一部悲惨的血泪史，都有一本苦尽甜来的今昔对比账。他们都是幼年就和亲人从江苏、山东、河北等地逃荒落户到西右营来的。天下的乌鸦一般黑，他们逃出火坑又入虎口。当时，这里不仅土地百分之九十掌握在地主手里，而且是军阀练兵，土匪盘踞，顽伪流杂汇集的巢穴。穷苦人一向称这里是“雁过拔毛”的地方。举目无亲的外乡逃荒人，投落到这里，就如同奴隶又带上枷锁，受着更加水深火热的阶级压榨和盘剥。
    想想过去苦，看看今日甜，革命老人们念念不忘恩人毛主席。他们把对毛主席深厚的无产阶级感情，化为实际行动。他们刻苦地学习毛主席著作，一字不识，就请红小兵当小先生，用收音机作辅导。他们身上经常带着《毛主席语录》和“老三篇”，见了识字的人就问。有时候，一句话记不住，半夜还坐起来默念，直到完全背会为止。他们说：“毛泽东思想是革命的宝，咱要学到老，用到老！”
    他们在斗争实践中，深深地体会到，毛主席的话字字值千金，句句重泰山。他们说：“对毛主席的书，学了不用，就等于种地不播种。”革命老人们，学一点，用一点。他们胸有朝阳，艰苦奋斗为革命，达到了忘我的境界。一次，全队召开批判大叛徒刘少奇“三自一包”反革命修正主义谬论大会。老人们纷纷手捧宝书来到了会场，唯有队长刘汝恭患病在床。当他在病床上听到“打倒刘少奇！”的口号声时，立刻记起“现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判”。老人想起毛主席教导，就忘掉了病痛，坚持叫自己的儿子搀扶着去参加大会。他儿子说：“你病得这么厉害，说给我听，我替你批判去吧。”老人着急地说：“不行！有一口气，我就要亲自去批判修正主义！”
    今天，“革命老头批判说理队”的老人们，在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报鼓舞下，决心按照公报提出的伟大战斗任务，紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，为夺取文化大革命的全面胜利作出新贡献。
