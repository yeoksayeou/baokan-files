The revolutionary committee of Lanzhou Longfeng Machinery Factory, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, has fully played the leading role of the working class in the struggle, criticism, and transformation. The entire factory has seen a new situation in both revolution and production, transforming from a backward factory to a bright red banner in the industrial front of Gansu Province.

Editor's Note: The experience of Longfeng Machinery Factory raises a fundamental issue in running a socialist enterprise: relying on Mao Zedong Thought from above and workers from below.

Relying on Mao Zedong Thought from above and workers from below is the fundamental guarantee for implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Mao Zedong Thought reflects the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the laboring people, and is the concentrated expression of proletarian thought. Relying on Mao Zedong Thought is the source of all our victories. Chairman Mao trusts the masses the most and respects the masses' spirit of innovation the most. Therefore, the working class and Chairman Mao are heart to heart. They understand Chairman Mao's latest instructions the deepest, follow his great strategic deployments the closest, are the most loyal to Chairman Mao, the most loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and the most loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Relying on workers from below can better ensure that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is unimpeded.

The "management" and "reliance" on the broad masses of workers are fundamentally different. The word "management" is a product of the revisionist factory management line of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi. Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices used a huge bureaucratic apparatus and unreasonable regulations and systems to "manage" workers. Relying on the workers is the core of Chairman Mao's proletarian factory management line. Our proletarian revolutionary power "directly relies on the broad revolutionary masses of the people." The revolutionary committee of Longfeng Machinery Factory is precisely because it has implemented this proletarian factory management line that it has been able to transform from a backward factory into a bright red banner in the industrial front of Gansu Province in just over two years.

Relying on Mao Zedong Thought from above and workers from below is the fundamental guarantee for consolidating the newly born revolutionary committees, for carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the unit, for promoting the thought revolutionization of the leading cadre, and for running socialist enterprises and all work. All factories, enterprises, and units should firmly grasp this fundamental issue, and they will be invincible.

According to a report from our newspaper, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, the revolutionary committee of Lanzhou Longfeng Machinery Factory in Gansu Province has relied on Mao Zedong Thought from above and workers from below. In simplifying organizations, reforming unreasonable regulations and systems, and transferring office personnel to the front lines, they have gained rich experience. They have initially established a set of proletarian enterprise management systems, fully playing the leading role of the working class. Both revolution and production have seen a new situation, transforming from a backward factory into a bright red banner in the industrial front of Gansu.

Following Chairman Mao is the fundamental way to rely

On October 24 last year, the revolutionary committee of the factory was born in the fierce struggle between the two lines. The committee members were determined to seize power for the proletariat, use power for the proletariat, and run a socialist enterprise well. With a burst of revolutionary enthusiasm, they adopted the method of "dividing troops to guard the mouth" and divided the entire factory's work among the seventeen committee members. Although they worked day and night, they still couldn't keep up. The old, large organizations had not been simplified, but new personnel had been added. At this time, Chairman Mao issued the latest instruction: "Revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative organizations, streamline personnel, and organize a revolutionary and mass-linked leading cadre." Old workers said meaningfully, "Work is left to the top, and the leaders are busy all day, resulting in grabbing one end and dropping the other. You should follow Chairman Mao's teachings and take the 'streamlining personnel' path, go to the production teams, rely on Mao Zedong Thought from above and workers from below, and seize power and run the factory well. You can't wear new shoes and walk the old path!"

Chairman Mao's teachings pointed the way, and the old workers' words sounded the alarm for the committee members. The factory revolutionary committee firmly followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, corrected the tendency of "dividing troops to guard the mouth" and package work, and carried out the first organizational reform. More than 170 cadres left the office and were transferred to the production front lines. Although this organizational reform was not thorough, it was praised by the workers. The workers said, "This is in line with Chairman Mao's teachings and in line with our hopes as the working class."

After streamlining personnel, although there were fewer people in the office, the cadres' sense of responsibility was strong, the phenomenon of passing the buck was reduced, work efficiency was improved, and work became easier to carry out. At this time, the class enemies were everywhere fanning the flames and carrying out vicious attacks, trying every means to sabotage and obstruct the revolutionary committee's implementation of streamlining personnel. The traitor Liu Shaoqi spread the revisionist black goods of "reading books to become officials" and "joining the party to become officials" to the cadres, and the old ideas of "despising labor" and "looking down on workers" left over from the old society also emerged. To follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, the factory revolutionary committee fought against the class enemies, fought against the old forces, and fought against the "self" in their own minds. They followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "class struggle, once grasped, it works" and mobilized the masses to thoroughly criticize the revisionist line that the traitor Liu Shaoqi had implemented in the construction of political power. They carried out struggles against the enemies and held Mao Zedong Thought study classes to guide the cadres to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, link it with their own active thoughts, deeply touch their souls, and free themselves from the old forces and old ideas. They quickly carried out the second, third, and fourth streamlining of personnel.

Now, they have simplified the bloated 28 departments into 3 groups and 1 office. The transferred office personnel account for 88% of the original cadres. In addition to the nine standing committee members taking turns to be on duty and preside over the overall work, the other members have all gone to the production front lines, learned from the workers, participated in production labor, and carried out the revolution and promoted production with the workers. The workers were very moved and said: The revolution cannot do without relying on Mao Zedong Thought from above and workers from below. You follow Chairman Mao closely and rely on us closely. With such a leading cadre, we workers are at ease. The workers' criticism and praise of the revolutionary committee made the committee members deeply realize from the previous experience and lessons: To achieve relying on Mao Zedong Thought from above and workers from below, the key is to follow closely. Without following closely, the "two relies" will be lost.

Participating in production labor to rely on workers from below

After streamlining personnel, cadres went to the site to work and solve problems with the workers. The factory revolutionary committee and the workshop revolutionary leading group often held open rectification meetings to listen to the masses' criticisms and accept the masses' supervision. Production meetings also invited workers to participate. These practices were warmly welcomed by the workers. At this time, some cadres thought they had relied enough, were satisfied with just visiting the teams, and talking and chatting with the workers.

The factory revolutionary committee, in response to the active thoughts of the cadres, organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's great teaching: "Our party and state cadres are ordinary laborers, not lords sitting on the heads of the people. Cadres, through participating in collective production labor, maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the laboring people. This is a major fundamental matter in the socialist system, which helps to overcome bureaucratism, prevent revisionism and dogmatism." The cadres actively participated in production labor. At the beginning, some cadres were worried that labor would take up a lot of time, and there would be no one to do the daily work and political and ideological work. But the fact was not like this. Cadres and workers labored together, implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions together, from shoulder to shoulder to heart to heart. The entire factory's thousands of workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought all took action, releasing tens of times, hundreds of times the power. As soon as some ideological problems appeared among the masses, the workers would consciously do political and ideological work, carry out heart-to-heart talks, and solve problems without passing them up. Some daily work related to grasping the revolution and promoting production, as soon as the cadres were about to start, the workers had already taken care of it. In the past, relying on a few cadres to do work was slow and inefficient; now, relying on the broad masses to do it is fast and efficient. The cadres further tasted the sweetness of laboring with the workers, and their enthusiasm for participating in labor increased.

Now, cadres have established deep proletarian feelings with the workers through labor. When cadres encounter difficulties, the workers all come to help, some think of ways, and others offer suggestions, making the cadres feel that with the masses, there is unlimited power. In June of this year, this factory accepted a production task for a new product. The higher-ups required trial production and production of the product in the same month. The cadres studied many times but could not arrange it due to insufficient preparation of process equipment and short time. They firmly believed that the masses had unlimited wisdom and strength, brought the problem to the workshop for labor, and told the workers the significance of producing this new product one by one. The workers all thought of ways and carried out innovations, and as a result, they completed the production task of this batch of new products ahead of time. The welding work of this factory has a large workload but low efficiency and has been a weak link for a long time. After a standing committee member of the revolutionary committee participated in production labor, he and the workers carried out technological innovations together. After more than 20 days of repeated experiments, they successfully developed a new type of welding method, which can improve work efficiency by tens of times. Long-standing problems that could not be solved were quickly solved.

Smashing the shackles of "control, restrict, and oppress," directly relying on the workers

The organization was simplified, and the cadres went down, but was it achieved to rely on Mao Zedong Thought from above and workers from below?

In the revolutionary criticism and struggle, revolutionary workers exposed the crimes of a small handful of capitalist roaders in the factory who used a set of regulations and systems to control, restrict, and oppress workers. Just in 1960, there were more than 60 kinds of formal administrative management systems, totaling more than 140,000 words. Materials from entering the factory to the hands of workers had to go through 26 procedures; replacing temporarily missing materials with materials of the same quality also required the approval of more than 10 departments; manufacturing an ordinary part also compiled a 60-page process document; workers even had to get a "work permit" to go to the toilet, etc. The workers were indignant and said that the revisionist management system had thousands of "regulations" and tens of thousands of "frames," in a word, it was to "control," "restrict," and "oppress" workers with cumbersome regulations and systems, not allowing workers to highlight Mao Zedong Thought and not allowing workers to fully play their unlimited wisdom and strength in managing enterprises.

The revolutionary committee believed that "control" and "rely" were the fundamental differences in principles between two classes, two powers, two lines, and two worldviews. Without thoroughly criticizing the traitor Liu Shaoqi's revisionist line of treating workers as "living tools," the newly born revolutionary committee would never be able to directly rely on the workers. Therefore, the revolutionary committee mobilized the masses to launch a fierce exposure, criticism, and attack on the revisionist management system. The painting group was a typical example in the struggle, criticism, and transformation movement.

The painting group's product process was imported from abroad, and there was more than a foot of process data alone. The capitalist roaders and bourgeois technical "authorities" used these "foreign doctrines" and "foreign frames" to bind the workers' hands and feet, resulting in the product quality not being able to pass the inspection for ten years. In the struggle, criticism, and transformation movement, the revolutionary committee's standing committee and the group workers together creatively developed a new electroplating painting technology with international standards, making the product quality reach an advanced level and improving work efficiency by tens of times. The entire process of this new technology only has three sentences, freeing the workers from the dizzying amount of process data. The cadres were infinitely excited and said: Reforming cumbersome regulations and systems, freeing the workers, also freed us.

Which systems should be abolished, which systems need to be reformed, and which systems can be retained? The revolutionary committee first mobilized the masses to study Chairman Mao's works and the "Three Articles," and then organized the masses to use Mao Zedong Thought to analyze the old regulations and systems and process procedures. Those that conformed to Mao Zedong Thought and the interests of the workers were retained, and those that did not conform were abolished and replaced with new ones. Through the reform of unreasonable regulations and systems, the workers took control of the technical power of production. Now, the workers have changed the past situation of "walking one step and not knowing the next step," taking control of the production plan themselves, changing from passive to active. In the past, the capitalist roaders used the inspection system to control the workers, but now the workers have played the role of masters, consciously eliminating quality problems in the production process. In the past, the capitalist roaders' system of using money to buy "innovations" was abolished, and the workers wholeheartedly served the people, carrying forward the spirit of daring to think and dare to do. In the past few months, they have implemented more than 70 technological innovations. The result of this reform is that a set of socialist enterprise management systems has been initially established, fully playing the leading role of the working class, and strongly promoting the rapid development of production.

　　上靠毛泽东思想　下靠工人群众
　　兰州市长风机器厂取得办好社会主义企业的基本经验
    厂革委会在支左解放军帮助下，充分发挥了工人阶级在斗、批、改中的领导作用，全厂革命和生产出现崭新气象，由一个后进厂一跃而为甘肃省工业战线上的一面鲜艳的红旗
    编者按：长风机器厂的经验，提出了我们办社会主义企业的一个根本的问题：上靠毛泽东思想，下靠工人群众。
    上靠毛泽东思想，下靠工人群众，是贯彻执行毛主席无产阶级革命路线的根本保证。毛泽东思想反映了无产阶级、劳动人民的根本利益，是无产阶级思想的集中表现。上靠毛泽东思想，是我们取得一切胜利的源泉。毛主席最相信群众、最尊重群众的首创精神，因此，工人阶级和毛主席心连心，对毛主席的一系列最新指示领会最深，对毛主席的伟大战略部署跟得最紧，最忠于毛主席，最忠于毛泽东思想，最忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。下靠工人群众，就能更好地保证毛主席的无产阶级革命路线畅行无阻。
    对广大工人群众的“管”和“靠”是有根本区别的。“管”字是叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇修正主义办厂路线的产物。刘少奇及其同伙，就是用庞大的官僚主义机构和不合理的规章制度“管”工人。依靠工人群众是毛主席的无产阶级办厂路线的核心。我们无产阶级的革命政权“就是直接依靠广大革命人民群众”。长风机器厂革委会正是因为执行了这条无产阶级办厂路线，才能在短短的两年多时间里，从一个后进工厂一跃而为甘肃省工业战线的一面鲜艳红旗。
    上靠毛泽东思想，下靠工人群众，是巩固新生的革命委员会的根本，是搞好本单位斗、批、改的根本，是促进领导班子思想革命化的根本，是办好社会主义企业和一切工作的根本。一切工厂、企业单位，紧紧抓住这个根本，就会无往不胜。
    本报讯　甘肃省兰州市长风机器厂革委会在支左解放军帮助下，上靠毛泽东思想，下靠工人群众，在精简机构、改革不合理的规章制度、下放科室人员等方面取得丰富经验，初步建立起一套无产阶级的企业管理制度，充分发挥了工人阶级的领导作用，革命和生产都出现了崭新气象，由一个后进厂一跃成了甘肃工业战线上一面鲜艳红旗。
    紧跟毛主席是“靠”的根本
    去年十月二十四日，厂革委会在两条路线的激烈搏斗中，宣告诞生了。革委会成员决心为无产阶级掌好权，用好权，办好社会主义企业。大家凭着一股革命热情，采取“分兵把口”的办法，十七个委员把全厂工作分工包下来。他们虽然废寝忘食地工作，还是忙不过来，旧的庞大机构还没有精简，却又增加了工作人员。这时候，毛主席发出：“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”的最新指示。老工人意味深长地说：“工作留在上头，一天到晚忙坏了头头，结果抓了这头，丢了那头。你们应紧跟毛主席他老人家的教导走‘精兵简政’的道路，到班组来，上靠毛泽东思想，下靠工人群众，才能掌好权，办好厂。你们可不能穿新鞋，走老路啊！”毛主席的教导给他们指明了方向，老工人一席话，给革委会成员敲起了警钟。厂革委会坚定不移地紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，纠正了“分兵把口”包办工作的倾向，进行了第一次机构改革，有一百七十多名干部走出办公室，下放到生产第一线。尽管这次机构改革还不彻底，却受到了工人的称赞，工人们说：“这样做才符合毛主席他老人家的教导，才符合我们工人阶级的希望。”
    精兵简政以后，虽然办公室人少，但干部的责任心强，扯皮的现象少，工作效率反而提高了，工作更加容易开展了。就在这时候，阶级敌人到处煽风点火，进行恶毒攻击，千方百计地破坏和阻挠革委会实行精兵简政。大叛徒刘少奇向干部散布的“读书做官”、“入党做官”论等修正主义黑货，以及旧社会遗留在人们头脑里的“鄙视劳动”、“轻视工人”等旧势力、旧思想也反映出来。为了紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，厂革委会和阶级敌人斗，和旧势力斗，和自己头脑中的“私”字斗。他们遵照毛主席“阶级斗争，一抓就灵”的教导，发动群众彻底批判大叛徒刘少奇在政权建设方面所推行的修正主义路线，开展对敌斗争。同时举办毛泽东思想学习班，引导干部以毛泽东思想为武器，联系自己的活思想，狠触灵魂，使干部从旧势力、旧思想中解放了出来。很快又进行了第二次、三次、四次精兵简政。
    现在，他们已经把臃肿的二十八个科室，精简为三组一室，下放的科室干部占原有干部的百分之八十八。革委会除九名常委实行轮流值班、主持全盘工作以外，其余成员都深入生产第一线，拜工人为师，参加生产劳动，和工人一起抓革命、促生产。工人们非常感动地说：革命离不开上靠毛泽东思想，下靠工人群众。你们跟毛主席跟得紧，靠我们靠得近，有这样的领导班子，我们工人放心了。工人群众对革委会从批评到表扬，使得委员们从前一段的经验和教训中，得到深刻的体会：要做到上靠毛泽东思想，下靠工人群众，关键在于紧跟，离开了紧跟，就会失去了“两靠”。
    参加生产劳动才能下靠工人群众
    精兵简政后，干部下到现场办公，和工人一起就地解决问题。厂革委会和车间革命领导小组还经常进行开门整风，听取群众的批评意见，接受群众的监督。召开生产会议也请工人参加。这些做法，都受到了工人的热情欢迎。这时，有的干部认为已经“靠”得差不多了，满足于在班组转转看看，和工人谈谈说说。
    厂革委会针对干部中的活思想，组织大家学习了毛主席的伟大教导：“我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷。干部通过参加集体生产劳动，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义。”使干部们自觉地参加了生产劳动。在开始时，有的干部担心劳动占去了许多时间，日常工作无人做，政治思想工作无人抓。但事实并非如此。干部和工人一起劳动，一起落实毛主席最新指示，由肩并肩到心连心，用毛泽东思想武装起来的全厂数千工人群众都行动起来了，发挥了数十倍、数百倍的力量。群众中的一些思想问题刚露头，工人们就自觉地做政治思想工作，开展谈心活动，做到矛盾不上交。一些关于抓革命和促生产的日常工作，干部们刚要着手抓，工人群众自己就已经办妥了。过去单纯依靠少数干部做工作，少慢差费；现在依靠广大群众动手，多快好省。干部进一步尝到了和工人群众一起劳动的甜头，参加劳动的积极性更高了。　
    现在，干部在劳动中和工人建立了深厚的无产阶级感情，干部遇到什么困难，工人们都前来帮助，这个想办法，那个出主意，使干部觉得，有了群众，力量无穷。今年六月，这个厂接受了一种新产品的生产任务，上级要求当月试制，当月出产品。干部们研究过多次，都因工艺装备准备不足，时间短，安排不下来。他们坚信群众中蕴藏着无限的智慧和力量，带着问题到车间劳动，把生产这种新产品的意义一一告诉工人群众；工人们纷纷想办法，搞革新，结果提前完成了这批新产品的生产任务。这个厂的焊接工作量大，效率却较低，长期以来是个薄弱环节。革委会的一个常委参加生产劳动以后，便和工人一起搞技术革新，经过二十多天的反复试验，试验成功一种新型的焊接方法，可以提高工效几十倍。长期得不到解决的问题，迅速解决了。
    砸碎“管、卡、压”的枷锁，直接依靠工人群众
    机构精简了，干部下去了，是不是就做到了上靠毛泽东思想，下靠工人群众呢？
    在革命大批判中，革命工人揭发了厂内一小撮走资派用一套套规章制度管工人、卡工人、压工人的滔天罪行。仅在一九六○年正式行文的行政管理制度就有六十余种，长达十四万言之多。材料从进厂到工人手中要经过二十六道手续；用质量相同的材料代替暂缺的材料，也要经过十多个部门批准；制造一个普通的零件，也编制了六十页的工艺文件；工人去厕所也要领“工出证”等等。工人们气愤地说，修正主义管理制度有千条“规章”，万条“框框”，一句话，就是用烦琐的规章制度“管”、“卡”、“压”工人，不让工人突出毛泽东思想，不让工人充分发挥管理企业的无限智慧和力量。
    革委会认为，“管”和“靠”是两个阶级、两种政权、两条路线、两种世界观的原则区别。不彻底批判大叛徒刘少奇把工人当“活工具”的反革命修正主义路线，新生的革委会就永远不能直接依靠工人群众。于是，革委会放手发动群众向修正主义的管理制度展开了猛烈的揭露、批判和冲击。涂漆小组就是斗、批、改运动中一个典型的例子。
    涂漆小组的产品工艺是从国外搬来的，仅工艺资料就有一尺多厚。走资派和资产阶级技术“权威”，把这些“洋教条”、“洋框框”用来束缚工人手脚，结果十年来产品质量一直过不了关。在斗、批、改运动中，革委会常委和小组工人一起，创造性地研究成功了一种具有国际水平的电泳涂漆新技术，使产品质量达到了先进水平，工效提高了几十倍。这种新技术的全部工艺只有三句话，使工人从令人头晕目眩的大量工艺资料中解放出来了。干部们无限兴奋地说：改革烦琐的规章制度，解放了工人，也解放了我们。
    哪些制度应该破除，哪些制度需要改革，哪些制度可以保留呢？革委会首先发动群众学习了毛主席著作，学习了“老三篇”，然后组织群众，用毛泽东思想分析旧的规章制度和工艺规程，凡是符合毛泽东思想的，符合工人群众利益的就保留，不符合的就破旧立新。通过改革不合理的规章制度，使工人掌握了生产技术大权。现在，工人改变过去“走了上一步，不知下一步”的状况，自己掌握生产计划，变被动为主动。过去走资派用检验制度卡工人，现在工人发挥了主人翁责任感，自觉地把质量问题消灭在生产过程中。过去，走资派用金钱收买“革新”的制度废除了，工人们全心全意为人民服务，发扬了敢想、敢干的革命精神，近几个月就实现了七十多项技术革新。这样改革的结果，初步建立起一套社会主义企业管理制度，充分发挥了工人阶级的领导作用，有力地促进了生产的迅速发展。
