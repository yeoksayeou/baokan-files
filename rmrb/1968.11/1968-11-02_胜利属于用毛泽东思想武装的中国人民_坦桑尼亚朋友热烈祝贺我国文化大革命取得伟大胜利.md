Some Tanzanian friends wrote to Chinese friends around the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, warmly congratulating the Chinese people on their great victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the leadership of Chairman Mao, and praising the ever-deepening friendship between the peoples of China and Tanzania.

The Chairman of the Zanzibar African-Shehrizzadeh Youth League, Sayyid Bakari Omar, wrote in a congratulatory letter to the Chinese Consulate in Zanzibar: "Over the past 19 years, the Chinese people, guided by the thoughts of Marx and Lenin, have achieved tremendous successes in building their country under the red banner of the great helmsman and navigator Mao Zedong, and under his and his close comrade-in-arms Lin Biao's leadership."

He said, "The actions taken by the Chinese Red Guards in response to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao personally, which smashed the conspiracy of the Chinese Khrushchev and his clique to restore capitalism, have deeply moved us young people in Zanzibar."

He praised and congratulated the great victory of the Chinese people in establishing revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions (excluding Taiwan Province) under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. He said, "The Chinese people have defeated the imperialists led by the United States and the anti-Marxist-Leninists, which is a great leap forward for China and the world. 'This is the victory of the Chinese people, a great historical achievement.'"

He also said in the letter: "We support the actions taken by the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao to aid those who are struggling for their rights and human dignity. We have seen examples of this on our island. We have seen how the Chinese experts here are helping us in our work and training our people to build our young nation in various ways. This is another victory for the Chinese people in aiding developing young nations and supporting the workers and peasants of the world."

The letter concludes: "Victory belongs to the Chinese people who follow Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Tanzanian peoples!"

A student from the University of East Africa in Tanzania wrote to the Xinhua News Agency's bureau in Dar es Salaam: "Firstly, I want to pay tribute to the great victories achieved by the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao."

The letter states that many African people who believe in the inevitable collapse of imperialism are "deeply moved by the just stance taken by the Chinese people on world issues."

    胜利属于用毛泽东思想武装的中国人民
    坦桑尼亚朋友热烈祝贺我国文化大革命取得伟大胜利
    据新华社达累斯萨拉姆电　一些坦桑尼亚朋友在中华人民共和国成立十九周年前后向中国朋友写信，热烈祝贺中国人民在伟大领袖毛主席领导下，在无产阶级文化大革命中取得的伟大胜利，并赞扬中坦两国人民友谊的日益发展。
    桑给巴尔非洲—设拉子青年联盟主席赛义夫·巴卡里·奥马尔在写给中国驻桑给巴尔领事馆的贺信中说：“十九年来，中国人民遵循马克思、列宁的思想，在伟大的统帅和舵手毛泽东主席的思想红旗的指引下，在他和他的亲密战友林彪的领导下，建设他们的国家，取得了十分巨大的成就。”
    他说，中国红卫兵响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召所采取的行动，毛主席亲自领导的文化大革命粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫及其一伙企图实行资本主义的阴谋，这些都使我们桑给巴尔青年倍受感动。
    他赞扬并祝贺中国人民在毛泽东思想指引下，在全国各省、市、自治区（除台湾省外）成立革命委员会的伟大胜利。他说，中国人民战胜了以美国为首的帝国主义和反马克思列宁主义的人，这对中国和全世界都是一个巨大的跃进。“这是中国人民的胜利，是伟大的历史。”
    他在信里还说：“我们支持毛主席领导下的中国人民为援助正在为争取自己权利和人类尊严而斗争的人们所采取的行动。这样的例子，我们在我们的岛上看到了。我们看到在这里的中国专家们是如何地在帮助我们工作和培训我们的人，从事建设我们年青国家的各项工作。这是中国人民援助要求发展的年青国家，也是支援世界工人、农民的又一胜利。”
    信中最后说：“胜利属于遵循毛泽东思想的中国人民！”“中国人民和坦桑尼亚人民的友谊万岁！”
    坦桑尼亚东非大学一位学生在写给新华社驻达累斯萨拉姆分社的信中说：“首先，我要向中国人民在毛主席领导下取得的越来越大的胜利致敬。”
    信中说，许多相信帝国主义必将崩溃的非洲人民，“对中国人民在世界问题上所采取的正义立场十分感动”。
