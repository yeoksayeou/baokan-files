Japanese people in Fukuoka protest against U.S. aircraft rampaging

The people of Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan, shouted slogans such as "Yankees, go home!" and continued to strongly protest against the rampaging of U.S. imperialist aircraft in Japan.

On the afternoon of the 15th, more than 200 students held a rally and demonstration in the busy district of Fukuoka City, strongly protesting against the crime of a U.S. military aircraft crashing near Fukuoka City on the 14th, destroying farmland and houses. They shouted slogans such as "Withdraw the U.S. military from the Itazuke base!" and "Yankees, get out of Japan!" in front of the U.S. Consulate in Fukuoka, and bravely fought against the reactionary police who came to suppress them.

On the same evening, more than 300 teachers from Kyushu University also held a demonstration in Fukuoka City, demanding the withdrawal of the U.S. military from the Itazuke base. At the same time, farmers in Ogi Town presented 13 demands to the U.S. military, including the withdrawal of the U.S. military from the Itazuke base and compensation for the losses suffered by farmers due to the crash of U.S. military aircraft. Students and young workers from Fukuoka City and Kitakyushu City who came to support the farmers' struggle in Ogi Town firmly supported the farmers' just demands.

West German masses hold anti-fascist demonstrations

More than 1,500 workers, students, and residents in West Germany held a large-scale demonstration in Siegen on the 16th, protesting against the new fascist party in West Germany, the National Democratic Party, holding a "representative conference" in North Rhine-Westphalia.

Large numbers of demonstrators braved the cold and began gathering in Siegen from the early morning of the 16th from nearby cities. They held up many banners denouncing the West German new fascist party, which read: "The National Democratic Party is the Nazi Party," and shouted slogans such as: "Nazis, get out!" and "Down with the National Democratic Party!" The demonstrators blocked the five entrances to the venue, preventing the Nazis from entering, causing most of the Nazis who attended the conference to be unable to arrive on time. The leader of the National Democratic Party, the veteran Nazi Adolf von Thadden, had to sneak into the venue through a side door.

The West German authorities, who have always tolerated fascist forces, dispatched more than 1,000 police officers and more than 100 police cars and water cannons to brutally suppress the demonstrators. However, the demonstrators were fearless. They braved the tear gas and water cannons and fought bravely with the police.

Spanish students launch anti-dictatorship struggles

Spanish students held demonstrations and rallies to oppose Franco's fascist dictatorship and the rotten capitalist education system. In the famous city of Barcelona, university students held a demonstration on the 13th to protest against police interference in schools. The fascist authorities dispatched mounted police to suppress the demonstrators. The demonstrators fought with the police.

In Madrid, university students held rallies to oppose the rotten capitalist education system.

In Bilbao, university students held a rally demanding the dismissal of the reactionary dean of the local university.

Eight thousand people in Northern Ireland demonstrate for democratic rights

The second-largest city in Northern Ireland, Derry, saw another large-scale demonstration for democratic rights on the 16th. Eight thousand demonstrators bravely fought against the large number of police who came to suppress them.

The Northern Ireland authorities, frightened by the massive demonstration on October 5, had ordered a ban on demonstrations in the central area of Derry, the old city, for one month. However, the people of Northern Ireland, disregarding this reactionary ban, still marched into the old city according to the original plan on November 16 and held a demonstration. The reactionary authorities ruthlessly dispatched a large number of police to suppress the demonstrators. The demonstrators were fearless and fought fiercely with the police using sticks and stones.

    西德群众举行反法西斯示威游行
    西德一千五百多名工人、学生和居民，十六日在济根举行大规模示威，抗议西德新法西斯党——国家民主党在济根举行北来因—威斯特伐利亚州“代表大会”。
    大批示威群众冒着严寒，自十六日清晨起就纷纷从邻近的城市向济根汇集。他们举着许多谴责西德新法西斯党的标语牌，上面写着：“国家民主党是纳粹党”，并且高呼口号：“纳粹，滚蛋！”“打倒国家民主党！”示威群众堵住会场的五个入口处，不许纳粹分子进去，使得参加这次大会的绝大部分纳粹分子不能按时到会，国家民主党头子、老牌纳粹分子阿道夫·冯·塔登只好偷偷摸摸地从便门溜进会场。
    一贯纵容法西斯势力的西德当局，出动了一千多名警察和一百多辆警车、水龙车残酷镇压示威群众。但是示威群众毫不畏惧，他们冒着催泪瓦斯和水龙的喷射，同警察进行了英勇的搏斗。

    北爱尔兰当局被十月五日声势浩大的示威吓破了胆，曾经下令一个月内禁止在德里的中心区——老城举行示威。但是北爱尔兰的人民群众不顾这一反动禁令，仍然按照原订计划在十一月十六日向老城进军，举行示威。反动当局悍然出动大批警察对示威群众进行镇压，示威群众毫无畏惧，他们用棍棒和石头同警察进行了激烈的搏斗。
