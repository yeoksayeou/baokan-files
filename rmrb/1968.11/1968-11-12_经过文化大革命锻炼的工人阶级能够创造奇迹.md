The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Nylon Factory have, after fiercely criticizing the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi's advocacy of "expert management of factories" and other fallacies, completed over forty technological innovations, with eight of them reaching or surpassing world advanced levels.

The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Nylon Factory have enthusiastically responded to the call of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. With the help of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the factory, the entire factory has launched a high tide of revolutionary criticism. The broad revolutionary workers have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fiercely criticizing the traitor Liu Shaoqi's advocacy of "expert management of factories," "technology first," and other fallacies, pushing the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the entire factory to a deeper level. Workers have proposed eighty-one technological innovation projects, completing over forty in a short period, with eight reaching or surpassing world advanced levels.

To run a socialist factory, should we rely on the working class and launch mass movements, or rely on the bourgeoisie and take the road of "expert management"? This is a struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads in the question of factory management. The traitor Liu Shaoqi advocated "expert management," opposed the leadership of the working class, and opposed launching mass movements. He said, "Do not assume that relying on the working class will solve all problems," and "especially rely on the factory director, engineers, and technicians." A small clique of capitalist-roaders in this factory, under Liu Shaoqi's black directive, colluded with bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities," establishing a large apparatus in the factory, formulating many rules and regulations, and controlling, restricting, and suppressing the workers. For example, in the spinning section, the moisture content of nylon short fibers should generally be controlled between 60% and 65%. If the moisture content is too high, it will cause the phenomenon of wet cotton blocking the rollers. Therefore, when the moisture content fluctuates, workers will adjust it. However, the bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" stipulated that workers could only deal with the phenomenon of wet cotton blocking the rollers and were not allowed to adjust the moisture content fluctuations. Workers who wanted to carry out technological revolutions had to go through three levels of approval: technical staff review, workshop director (engineer) approval, and chief engineer approval. These approvals and regulations tied the workers' hands and feet, restricted the workers' creativity, and many major technological innovation and technological revolution projects were shelved.

In the high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation, the broad revolutionary workers, following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "the working class must lead everything," launched a deep criticism of the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi and his agents' advocacy of "expert management," "technology first," and other fallacies. The broader the criticism, the more the revolutionary workers hated the traitor Liu Shaoqi, and the higher their political awareness. Workers said, "The large apparatus and unreasonable regulations are the means by which the traitor Liu Shaoqi and his agents implement the revisionist factory management line and carry out capitalist restoration, tying the workers' hands and feet."

In the high tide of revolutionary criticism, workers broke through the unreasonable regulations, abolished the production office, and established three-in-one technical leadership groups in each workshop, led by workers and participated in by revolutionary cadres and technicians, fully playing the leading role of the working class.

The factory's process equipment was imported from abroad. In the past, the capitalist-roaders in the factory and bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" vigorously promoted the traitor Liu Shaoqi's "crawling philosophy." They said, "What foreign experts have not said cannot be done." They attempted to make China's nylon industry forever crawl behind foreigners. The broad revolutionary workers angrily said, "Why can't we take our own path and have to follow in others' footsteps, crawling step by step?"

After fiercely criticizing the traitor Liu Shaoqi's "crawling philosophy," the workers proudly said, "We have the invincible guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and will definitely overcome all difficulties and achieve victory."

Based on the characteristics of nylon fibers, they boldly proposed to shorten the entire production process of the spinning section by one-third. The broad workers commanded the battle with Mao Zedong Thought. In the initial stage of the experiment, the product quality was unstable. They followed Chairman Mao's great teaching of "practice, cognition, and then practice and cognition again," seriously analyzed the problems that arose during the experiment, took measures, and put them back into practice for verification. After repeated experiments, they finally succeeded.

This technological revolution not only saved the country a large number of equipment but also greatly increased the product's output and quality, improved labor productivity, and reduced consumption. The success of this technological revolution gave the traitor Liu Shaoqi's "crawling philosophy" a resounding slap in the face!

Experts from capitalist countries once said that nylon equipment "cannot increase production." Bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" also said in the same tone, "Do not try to increase production; it is good enough to master this technology." Under their control, a production-increasing suggestion with international advanced levels proposed by the worker masses was shelved for more than three years. After the proletarian cultural revolution entered the stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation, the worker masses, with revolutionary enthusiasm to make Chairman Mao proud and bring glory to the Chinese working class, proposed this innovation again. "We must break the conventions and adopt advanced technology as much as possible to build our country into a modernized socialist power in a not too long historical period." Chairman Mao's great teaching gave the working class boundless wisdom and courage. The broad worker masses fought for twenty-nine days and successfully completed the major innovation of increasing nylon fiber production by 62%. Revolutionary workers excitedly said, "The success of this innovation project is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. It proves that the Chinese working class, tempered by the cultural revolution, can create any miracle in the world! Let the traitor Liu Shaoqi's 'crawling philosophy' of worshipping foreign things and kneeling before imperialism and revisionism go to hell!"

　　经过文化大革命锻炼的工人阶级能够创造奇迹
　　北京维尼纶厂革命职工狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇推行的“专家治厂”等谬论后，完成四十多项技术革新，有八项达到和超过世界先进水平
    本报讯　北京维尼纶厂的革命职工热烈响应党的八届扩大的十二中全会的号召，在驻厂解放军的帮助下，全厂掀起了革命大批判高潮。广大革命职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠批叛徒刘少奇鼓吹的“专家治厂”、“技术第一”等谬论，推动全厂的斗、批、改向纵深发展。工人提出了八十一个技术革新项目，在短短的时间里，已完成四十多项，其中有八项达到和超过了世界先进水平。
    办社会主义工厂，是依靠工人阶级，大搞群众运动，还是依靠资产阶级，走“专家治厂”的道路，这是在办厂问题上两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。叛徒刘少奇鼓吹“专家治厂”，反对工人阶级领导，反对大搞群众运动。他胡说什么：“不要以为依靠工人阶级就没有问题的”，“特别依靠厂长、工程师和技师。”这个厂的一小撮走资派在刘少奇的黑指示下，勾结资产阶级反动技术“权威”，在厂里设立庞大的机构，制定许多条条和框框，对工人实行管、卡、压。如整理工段，维尼纶短纤维的水分一般应控制在百分之六十至百分之六十五，水分多了就会产生湿棉堵辊的现象。因此，当水分波动时，工人们都会调整。可是，资产阶级反动技术“权威”却规定工人只能处理湿棉堵辊现象，不许调整水分波动。工人想搞技术革命就得经过技术员审核，车间主任（工程师）点头，总工程师批准三道关卡。这些关卡和规章制度束缚着工人的手脚，限制了工人的创造性，把工人的许多重大技术革新和技术革命项目打入了冷宫。
    在斗、批、改的高潮中，广大革命职工遵照毛主席关于“工人阶级必须领导一切”的伟大教导，对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其代理人所鼓吹的“专家治厂”、“技术第一”等谬论，展开了深入地批判。广大革命职工越批，对叛徒刘少奇越痛恨，越批，政治觉悟越高。工人们说：“庞大的机构和不合理的规章制度，是叛徒刘少奇及其代理人推行修正主义办厂路线，搞资本主义复辟的手段，是束缚工人手脚的绳索。”
    在革命大批判的高潮中，工人们大破了不合理的规章制度，取消了生产办公室，各车间成立由工人领导的、革命干部和技术员参加的三结合技术领导小组，充分发挥了工人阶级的领导作用。
    这个厂的工艺设备是从外国进口的。过去，厂里的走资派和资产阶级反动技术“权威”，竭力推行叛徒刘少奇的“爬行哲学”。他们说：“外国专家没说过的不能动。”企图使我国维尼纶工业永远跟在洋人后边爬行。广大革命工人气愤地说：“为什么我们不能走自己的路，要踏着别人的脚印一步一步爬呢？”
    工人们在狠批叛徒刘少奇的“爬行哲学”之后，豪迈地说：“我们有战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指导，一定能排除万难，取得胜利。”
    他们根据维尼纶纤维的特性，大胆地提出把牵切纺车间的整个生产工艺流程缩短三分之一。广大工人用毛泽东思想指挥战斗，试验初期，产品质量不稳定，他们就遵照毛主席关于“实践、认识、再实践、再认识”的伟大教导，把在试验过程中发生的问题，进行认真分析，采取措施，再放到实践中去检验，经过反复的试验，终于试验成功了。
    这一项技术革命的成功，不仅为国家节省了大批设备，而且大大提高了产品的产量和质量，提高了劳动生产率，降低了消耗。这一技术革命的成功，狠狠地给叛徒刘少奇“爬行哲学”一记响亮的耳光！
    资本主义国家的专家曾认为，维尼纶设备“不能再增产了”。资产阶级反动技术“权威”也以同样的腔调说：“不要搞什么增产试验了，能掌握这套技术就不错了。”在他们的把持下，工人群众提出的一项具有国际先进水平的增产建议，被他们打入冷宫三年多。在无产阶级文化大革命进入斗、批、改阶段后，工人群众怀着为毛主席争气，为中国工人阶级争光的革命豪情，又重新提出了这项革新。“我们必须打破常规，尽量采用先进技术，在一个不太长的历史时期内，把我国建设成为一个社会主义的现代化的强国。”毛主席的伟大教导，给了工人阶级无穷的智慧和勇气。广大工人群众奋战二十九天，成功地完成了维尼纶纤维增产百分之六十二的重大革新。革命职工激动地说：“这项革新项目的成功是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利。事实证明，经过文化大革命锻炼的中国工人阶级，什么人间奇迹也能创造出来！让叛徒刘少奇崇洋仿外、跪倒在帝国主义、修正主义脚下的‘爬行哲学’，见鬼去吧！”
