The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In socialist society, classes and class struggle still exist, and there is a struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism." Yet, the traitor Liu Shaoqi spouts nonsense such as: "Class struggle is basically over... The most important task for the country now is to organize social life." Is it really true that "class struggle is basically over"? No! The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has shown us with harsh facts: A handful of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist-roaders are frantically weakening and destroying the dictatorship of the proletariat, attempting to carry out a capitalist restoration in our country. This so-called "organizing social life" is a sugar-coated bullet fired at us by Liu Shaoqi.

From 1958 to 1960, this great traitor Liu Shaoqi made three visits to Minhang and twice sneaked into our factory, using "inspection" as a cover to extensively promote the idea that "organizing social life" is an important measure to "care for the lives of workers." What kind of "social life" did this traitor want to "organize"? This traitor said: "You in Minhang can set up a textile factory to solve the problem of young people's love affairs." Once the master's order was given, the minions followed it like a sacred decree, rushing to organize weekend dances to find partners for the youth, turning the "union" into a "marriage introduction agency" for a time. Liu Shaoqi shamelessly said: "More dance parties should be held, and unmarried youth should wear a badge on their chests with their age and name, making it convenient for them to find partners." Thus, in Minhang, construction was booming, and a special open-air night garden was set up. For this purpose, some female waitresses were also selected, and every night, they used seductive music as bait to corrupt the youth.

What Liu Shaoqi "cared" about was how to make young workers become revisionists; he "cared" about how to lead young workers into the depths of bourgeois decadent life; he "cared" about restoring capitalism in China. It is clear that this great traitor Liu Shaoqi wanted to use the sinister means of "organizing social life" to make us stop class struggle, so that our successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause would comfortably become successors to capitalism. Liu Shaoqi's advocacy of "organizing social life" itself is an attack by the bourgeoisie on the proletariat. Under the attack of Liu Shaoqi's sugar-coated bullets, some young workers with weak wills were poisoned, and some young people even became listless every day, immersed in bourgeois decadent life, and finally took the path of crime. This is another account that Liu Shaoqi, this great traitor, owes, and we must thoroughly settle it and eliminate its poison.

"Never forget class struggle." Forgetting the existence of classes and class struggle will lead to the loss of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the restoration of capitalism. We must follow the great teachings of Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle." Talk about class and class struggle every day, every month, and every year, and strive for the great historical mission of realizing the highest ideal of our working class and achieving communism!

    砍倒刘少奇“组织社会生活”的黑旗
    上海汽轮机厂革命委员会
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“社会主义社会还存在着阶级和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义和资本主义这两条道路的斗争。”可是，大内奸刘少奇却胡诌什么：“阶级斗争基本结束……今后国家最重要的任务是组织社会生活”。果真是“阶级斗争基本结束”了吗？不！无产阶级文化大革命以严酷的事实告诉我们：一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派，丧心病狂地削弱、破坏无产阶级专政，妄图在我国实行资本主义复辟。所谓“组织社会生活”，就是刘少奇向我们发出的一颗糖衣炮弹。
    一九五八年到一九六○年期间，刘少奇这个大工贼，三下闵行，两次钻进我厂，以“视察”为名，大肆宣扬“组织社会生活”是“关心职工生活”的重要措施等等。他要“组织”什么样的“社会生活”呢？这个工贼说：“你们闵行可以办一个纺织厂，来解决青年人恋爱问题。”主子的旨意一出口，虾兵蟹将奉若圣旨，纷纷出动，大搞周末舞会，为青年物色对象，一度把“工会”变成了“婚姻介绍所”。刘少奇还恬不知耻地说：“要多开交谊舞会，让未婚青年胸前挂上一块牌子，写上年龄、姓名，便于互相找对象。”于是乎，就在闵行大兴土木，专门开设了露天夜花园，为此还物色了一些女招待员，每天晚上放着靡靡之音作诱饵，腐蚀青年人。
    刘少奇所“关心”的是怎样使青年工人变修；他“关心”的是如何把青年工人引入资产阶级糜烂生活的深坑；他“关心”的是在中国复辟资本主义。很清楚，刘少奇这个大工贼就是要通过用“组织社会生活”这一险恶的手段，让我们不再搞阶级斗争，使我们无产阶级革命事业的接班人舒舒服服地演变为资本主义的接班人。刘少奇鼓吹“组织社会生活”，这本身就是资产阶级向无产阶级的进攻。在刘少奇的糖衣炮弹攻击之下，一些意志薄弱的青年工人中了毒，有的青年甚至成天委靡不振，沉浸在资产阶级糜烂生活之中，最后走上了犯罪的道路。这就是刘少奇这个大工贼欠下的又一笔账，我们必须要彻底清算，肃清其流毒。
    “千万不要忘记阶级斗争”。忘记阶级的存在，忘记阶级斗争，就会丧失无产阶级政权，就会导致资本主义复辟。我们要遵循毛主席的伟大教导，彻底批判刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”。天天讲，月月讲，年年讲阶级和阶级斗争，为实现我们工人阶级最高理想，实现共产主义伟大历史使命而奋斗！
