Edition: 2

The report by Chairman Mao at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has been reissued. The important editorials in the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily on the same day have conveyed Chairman Mao's latest and extremely important instructions. Chairman Mao's report and latest instructions are the best keys to happiness, the brightest guiding lights, and the sharpest weapons for struggle for us poor and lower-middle class herdsmen. The more we study, the more we love our great leader Chairman Mao, and the more we hate the number one capitalist-roader within the Party, Liu Shaoqi. The more we study, the closer we feel to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and the more fiercely we criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line.

"Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman; conducting revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Whenever the revolution is at a turning point, our hearts are filled with the brightest red sun, Chairman Mao, who always timely, correctly, and wisely points out the direction of the revolution for us. The 13 million people of various ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia, and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle class herdsmen, have come to understand through long-term revolutionary practice a great truth: the greatest love is from Chairman Mao, greater than that of parents. Chairman Mao is the great savior of all ethnic laboring people in China. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the lifeline of us poor and lower-middle class herdsmen. As long as we always follow Chairman Mao and are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we will be invincible.

In his report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chairman Mao pointed out: "After the enemies with guns have been eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist, and they will inevitably fight to the death with us. We must not underestimate these enemies. If we do not raise and recognize this issue now, we will make a great mistake." The great traitor, great internal spy, and great saboteur Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Inner Mongolia are loyal running dogs of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries. They are the backers of the feudal princes, landlords, and all class enemies, and the most important and dangerous "enemies without guns" under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship in our country. Whenever there is a change in the revolution, they jump out to represent the interests of the imperialists, revisionists, and exploiting classes, and fight to the death against Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Inner Mongolia have always opposed Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and stubbornly pushed a counter-revolutionary revisionist and splittist line. They fiercely opposed democratic reforms in the pastoral areas, openly using the capitulationist policy of "not dividing, not struggling, not classifying," and "benefiting both the landlords and herdsmen," to long suppress the strong revolutionary demands of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle class herdsmen to "classify and struggle against the landlords," and not allow the poor and lower-middle class herdsmen to revolt. They openly opposed the wise instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao on "national struggles, in the final analysis, are a class struggle issue," using the banner of "acknowledging history and considering reality," to promote "three autonomies and one contract," and engage in splittism. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Liu Shaoqi and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, along with their agents in Inner Mongolia, seeing that things were not going well, hurriedly put forward a bourgeois reactionary line, engaged in counter-revolutionary economism, suppressed revolutionary masses, and used every means to block Chairman Mao's voice and sabotage Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, attempting to extinguish the flames of this cultural revolution. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle class herdsmen, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are unyielding and cannot be deceived. In the more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle class herdsmen, holding high the banner of "it is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," smashed the bourgeois "independent kingdom" established by Liu Shaoqi's agents in Inner Mongolia, seized back the part of the party, government, financial, and cultural powers they had usurped, and settled accounts with their counter-revolutionary revisionist and splittist line, launching a revolutionary storm of classifying and struggling against the landlords, and completely uprooted the feudal exploitative system. This is the second liberation of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle class herdsmen, and a great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in the vast pastoral areas.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Historical experience is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, should be constantly and repeatedly spoken. It is not enough to speak to a few people; it must be known to the broad revolutionary masses." Chairman Mao's latest and extremely important instructions have further indicated the direction for us to carry out the various combat tasks proposed in the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and to achieve an overall victory in the cultural revolution in the pastoral areas. Raising the awareness of the struggle between the two lines is the primary issue in continuing the revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship. Not understanding what is Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and what is Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois reactionary line will lead to losing direction when the exploiting classes and their agents attack Chairman Mao's revolutionary line from the right or in the form of "left" but right. We, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle class herdsmen, are determined to closely unite around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, quickly launch a mass movement to study and propagate the history of the struggle between the two lines, seriously study the historical experience of the struggle between the two lines, and study Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. We will further arm our minds with Chairman Mao's theory on continuing the revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, constantly raise our class struggle and two-line struggle awareness, and forever follow Chairman Mao, generation after generation, with unchanging hearts even if the seas dry up and the stones crumble.

    越学对毛主席的革命路线越亲
    内蒙古自治区革委会委员、贫牧　宝日勒代
    毛主席的《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》重新发表了，《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》在同一天的重要社论中，又传达了毛主席极其重要的最新指示。毛主席的报告和最新指示，是我们贫下中牧最好的开心钥匙，最亮的指路明灯，最锐利的斗争武器。我们越学越爱伟大领袖毛主席，越学越恨党内头号走资派刘少奇。我们越学，对毛主席革命路线越亲，批判刘少奇反革命修正主义路线也就越狠。
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”每当革命处在转折关头，我们各族人民心中最红的红太阳毛主席，总是最及时、最正确、最英明地给我们指明革命的航向。内蒙古一千三百万各族革命人民，广大贫下中牧从长期的革命斗争实践中，越来越清楚地懂得了一条最伟大的真理：天大地大不如毛主席的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲。毛主席是全中国各族劳动人民的大救星，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是我们贫下中牧的生命线，永远紧跟毛主席，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，我们就无往而不胜。
    毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》中指出：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。如果我们现在不是这样地提出问题和认识问题，我们就要犯极大的错误。”大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇和他在内蒙古的代理人，是帝修反的忠实走狗，是封建王公、牧主阶级和一切阶级敌人的总后台，是我国无产阶级专政条件下最主要、最危险的“不拿枪的敌人”。每逢革命的转变关头，他们总是跳出来，代表帝修反和剥削阶级的利益，同毛主席的无产阶级革命路线“作拚死的斗争”。
    刘少奇和他在内蒙古的代理人，一贯对抗毛主席的革命路线，顽固地推行一条反革命修正主义、民族分裂主义路线。他们疯狂地反对牧区的民主改革，明目张胆地用“不分、不斗、不划阶级”、“牧主、牧工两利”的投降主义政策，长期压制广大贫下中牧“划阶级、斗牧主”的强烈革命要求，不准贫下中牧起来革命。他们公开对抗伟大领袖毛主席的“民族斗争，说到底，是一个阶级斗争问题”的英明指示，打着“承认历史，照顾现实”的招牌，大搞“三自一包”，大搞民族分裂主义。在这场无产阶级文化大革命运动中，刘少奇等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在内蒙古的代理人，眼看大事不好，就急急忙忙抛出一条资产阶级反动路线，大搞反革命经济主义，镇压革命群众，千方百计地封锁毛主席的声音，破坏毛主席的伟大战略部署，妄想把这场文化大革命的烈火扑灭。用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大贫下中牧是压不垮、骗不了的。在两年多的无产阶级文化大革命中，广大贫下中牧，高举对反动派造反有理的大旗，砸烂了刘少奇在内蒙古的代理人建立的资产阶级“独立王国”，把他们窃取的那部分党政财文大权夺了回来，清算了他们的反革命修正主义、民族分裂主义路线，掀起划阶级、斗牧主的革命风暴，彻底铲除了封建剥削制度。这是广大贫下中牧的第二次解放，这是毛主席革命路线在广大牧区的伟大胜利。
    毛主席最近指出：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”毛主席的这一极其重要的最新指示，为我们贯彻党的八届十二中全会公报提出的各项战斗任务，夺取牧区文化大革命的全面胜利，进一步指明了前进的方向。提高两条路线斗争的觉悟，是在无产阶级专政的条件下，继续革命的首要问题。不懂得什么是毛主席的革命路线，什么是刘少奇的资产阶级反动路线，就会在剥削阶级及其代理人从右的方面或以形“左”实右的形式向毛主席的革命路线进行反扑的时候，迷失方向。我们广大贫下中牧决心紧紧地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，迅速掀起一个学习、宣传两条路线斗争史的群众运动，认真学习两条路线斗争的历史经验，学好毛主席一系列最新指示，进一步用毛主席关于在无产阶级专政下继续革命的学说，武装自己的头脑，不断提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，世世代代永远紧跟毛主席，海枯石烂不变心。
