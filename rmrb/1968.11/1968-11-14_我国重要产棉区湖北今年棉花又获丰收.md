Under the great guideline of Chairman Mao's "grasp revolution, promote production," Hubei Province, an important cotton-producing region in our country, has again achieved a bumper cotton harvest this year. This is the third consecutive year of bumper cotton harvests brought about by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. At present, the broad masses of people's commune members, inspired by the Public Report of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, are redoubling their efforts to carefully and meticulously pick the new cotton and are sending the bumper harvest cotton to the purchasing points continuously.

The "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by Chairman Mao point out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of social productive forces in our country." To use revolution to lead production and promote production, this is the fundamental reason why Hubei Province has achieved a bumper cotton harvest this year. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have firmly put the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought in the first place, using Mao Zedong Thought to lead everything and promote everything. Since this spring, the entire province's rural areas have held tens of thousands of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The broad masses of commune members and revolutionary cadres have studied in these classes, repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Old Three Articles," and have been breaking private interests and establishing public interests. The broad masses of peasants and cadres have carried out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism. At the same time, the broad masses of rural people's liberation army have extensively carried out the "Four Good" brigade and "Five Good" commune member movements, greatly promoting the thought revolutionization of people, and in cotton production, many good deeds and good people who grasp revolution and promote production have emerged.

This year, during the cotton growth period, many regions in Hubei Province suffered from a drought lasting more than a month; during the cotton growth peak period, various cotton-producing areas suffered from floods, and some regions had rare historical floods. However, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, with a red heart for revolutionary farming, have fully displayed a fearless revolutionary spirit, overcome the special major natural disasters, and achieved a bumper cotton harvest.

    我国重要产棉区湖北今年棉花又获丰收
    在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针指引下，我国重要产棉区湖北省今年棉花又获得丰收。这是无产阶级文化大革命带来的连续第三个棉花丰收年。目前，广大人民公社社员在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报鼓舞下，正加倍努力，精采细摘新棉，并且把丰收棉源源不断地送到各收购点。
    毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”以革命统帅生产、推动生产，这是湖北省夺得今年棉花丰收的根本原因。广大贫下中农和革命干部坚定不移地把活学活用毛泽东思想放在首位，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，推动一切。今春以来，全省农村举办了数以万计的各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，广大社员和革命干部在学习班里，反复学习毛主席的最新指示和“老三篇”，破私立公。广大社员和干部深入持久地展开了革命大批判。同时，广大农村大学解放军，广泛地开展了“四好”社队、“五好”社员的运动，大大促进了人的思想革命化，在棉花生产中，涌现出许多抓革命、促生产的好人好事。
    今年，湖北省棉花生长苗期，许多地区遭受持续一月以上的旱灾；棉花生长旺期，各产棉区又普遍遭受涝灾，有的地区的灾情是历史上少有的。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大贫下中农，怀着一颗为革命种田的红心，充分发扬大无畏的革命精神，战胜了特大的自然灾害，夺得了棉花丰收。
