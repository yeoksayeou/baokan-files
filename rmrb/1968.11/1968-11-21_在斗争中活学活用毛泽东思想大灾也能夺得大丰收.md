Recently, many comrades from all over the country have asked us to share how Dazhai achieved a bountiful harvest despite suffering a major hailstorm this year. The Dazhai Party Branch believes: No matter how many ways there are, relying on Mao Zedong Thought is the first and foremost; whatever methods there are, actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought will provide endless effective methods.

Methods are devised in the struggle against difficulties

This year, Dazhai experienced two disasters: drought and hail. In particular, the severe hailstorm in July was unprecedented. Not only had the young people of Dazhai never seen such a storm, but even those in their seventies and eighties had never encountered one. At that time, Dazhai's 700-plus mu of corn and sorghum were all damaged, and every plot was affected. The situation was extremely serious. However, the Dazhai Party Branch and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our difficulties are able to be overcome, because we are a new force with a bright future." The people of Dazhai did not bow to difficulties and did not sigh in despair. Instead, they were full of confidence and vigor, launching a tenacious struggle against the disaster.

Many sorghum seedlings were damaged by the hail. Agricultural production is constrained by the season, and it is impossible to destroy and replant. This prompted us to think about a problem: To deal with hailstorms, we cannot just focus on planting well; we must also be able to transplant successfully. Hail damage is not as widespread as drought or flooding. We transplanted sorghum seedlings from unaffected neighboring brigades into our sorghum fields. With careful management, this year's sorghum yield was the best in history, with over 800 jin per mu, a 30% increase over last year's bumper harvest. This made us think: If we can successfully transplant sorghum seedlings during disasters, can't we do the same when there are no disasters? Planting a season of wheat first and then transplanting sorghum seedlings can turn a single harvest into a double harvest. This way, we can not only prevent hailstorms but also increase the production of fine grains, better supporting national construction and the world revolution.

This year's hailstorm also helped us solve a problem that had not been addressed for many years. Dazhai's land is situated on steep slopes and ridges. In the past, we only planted corn in the low-lying areas and not other crops. The reason is that during the rainy season, the floodwaters from the mountains would wash away other crops. Only corn, with its tall stalks and deep roots, could withstand the floods. From my earliest memories, we have been planting corn, and we still do so today. Due to planting a single crop for many years, we could not rotate crops, which limited the increase in yield from these plots. Now that we have the experience of transplanting, these low-lying areas have also started to rotate crops, and many plots have already been planted with wheat.

We dared to reform the old cultivation system and break the old rules that had been in place for many years. We should "thank" the hailstorm for this. It was the hailstorm that forced us to conduct large-scale trials of sorghum seedling transplantation on 120 mu of sorghum fields and achieve success. Without this hailstorm, reforming the old cultivation system would certainly have encountered many obstacles!

This year, Dazhai not only had a bountiful grain harvest but also a bumper vegetable harvest. After the hailstorm, cadres and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants all thought of ways to make the most of every inch of land and plant more. They fully utilized the land along roads, canals, and all idle plots to expand the area for vegetable planting. This year's vegetable harvest not only met the needs of the community members but also could be sold to the state.

These facts all illustrate a truth: Natural disasters are bad, but they are also good. They force us to break conventions and come up with various methods to overcome difficulties. Since 1961, the Dazhai Production Brigade has faced severe droughts, windstorms, insect infestations, and floods. This year, we overcame a severe hailstorm. This has given us more methods to fight against natural disasters and achieve bumper harvests. Great leader Mao Zedong teaches us: "All new things are forged in the midst of arduous struggles." "In the face of the Communist Party, there are no difficulties, because it can overcome difficulties." Our methods for overcoming disasters are derived from actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle against difficulties. Learning from Chairman Mao's works in the midst of struggle, learning deeply and applying actively

"Mao Zedong Thought is the treasure of treasures; it is indispensable for revolution at any moment." Actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works has become the first need in the lives of cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants in Dazhai. However, relatively speaking, we grasp it more tightly, learn more deeply, and apply it more actively during non-disaster times.

Chairman Mao taught us long ago: "What is work? Work is struggle. Where there are difficulties and problems, we need to go and solve them. We work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go, that is the good comrade." Many people can recite this teaching by Chairman Mao. However, during times of smooth work, it is often not deeply understood. During this year's severe disaster, floodwaters submerged the homes of two community members. Cadres and community members jumped into chest-deep water together, risking their lives to rescue the community members' property. During the days of transplanting sorghum seedlings, cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants all vied to take on heavy tasks. People in their sixties and seventies, and children as young as seven or eight, all joined in. They started work at four in the morning and returned late at night, working thirteen or fourteen hours a day. Everyone was determined to make up for the losses caused by the hailstorm. Thus, our learning of Chairman Mao's teachings on how to face difficulties was not only further understood but, more importantly, imprinted in our minds and put into action.

Facing a severe disaster, cadres were anxious, their work style was tense, swift, and decisive, saying one thing and doing another without delay, and achieving results in whatever they did. The community's awareness was high, and cadres grasped it tightly, making timely and effective measures to overcome the disaster. Corn was weeded four times this year instead of the usual three, and fertilizer was applied twice instead of once. This year, all work was completed ahead of schedule, and all tasks were completed neatly and efficiently. What was the reason for this? This is what Chairman Mao taught us in the article "The Working Method of the Party Committee": "The Party Committee not only must 'grasp' the main work but also must 'grasp it tightly.' Only by grasping something very tightly and without letting go can it be grasped. If it is grasped but not tightly, it is as good as not grasping it." Thus, cadres deeply understood the profound meaning of Chairman Mao's teaching that work must be "grasped tightly." Therefore, overcoming a severe disaster raised the cadres' ideological style by a big step.

Comrade Lin Biao instructed us: "Study Chairman Mao's works by bringing problems to the study, learning actively and applying actively, integrating learning and application, learning what is urgently needed, and seeing immediate results." In our struggle against disasters, we studied Chairman Mao's works by learning and applying, using and learning, and integrating learning and application. Some comrades praised the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai for learning Mao Zedong Thought and putting it into practice, not just talking. The reason for this, I believe, is inseparable from our annual struggle against class enemies and natural disasters, learning in struggle, and applying in struggle.

Disasters prompted us to examine our work and find gaps

In recent years, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and inspired by Chairman Mao's great call to "Learn from Dazhai in Agriculture," as well as the promotion of comrades who came to visit Dazhai, our Dazhai has undergone earth-shaking changes. However, does the work of the Dazhai Party Branch have any shortcomings? Are there still areas where we have not done enough and need urgent improvement? On this issue, the Party Branch has held many meetings and conducted self-criticism. However, to be honest, we did not see clearly, grasp accurately, or have the determination to correct during times of non-severe disasters.

Before the severe hailstorm, there was debate over whether Dazhai's land could be used to plant more wheat, increasing the planting area of wheat from the previous 5% to 30-40%. Some comrades believed that Dazhai's terrain is high and cold, with early frosts in spring and early frosts in autumn, making wheat yields low, and expanding wheat planting would reduce yields. This hailstorm "helped" us solve this problem. Everyone realized: Because wheat is harvested early, planting wheat can prevent hail and floods; and it can achieve summer disaster compensation in autumn and autumn disaster compensation in the following summer, increasing the planting of some wheat will not reduce yields. Moreover, in the past, Dazhai planted sorghum relatively densely, with about 25,000 plants per mu, and last year's yield reached 600 jin per mu, which was considered good. This year, the hail damaged the sorghum seedlings, and the transplanted seedlings were reduced by more than 20% compared to previous years. Due to better ventilation and light, the yield increased significantly, which gave us another vivid lesson. The people of Dazhai have broken many old frameworks year after year, come up with new ideas, and heard many words of praise. If someone had said we had conservative thoughts before the disaster, we might have found it hard to accept. However, this hailstorm "helped" us realize that we indeed have conservative and dare-not-think, dare-not-speak, dare-not-do aspects. If there is no such problem in one aspect, there may be in another; if there is no such problem in one period, there may be in another. Chairman Mao said long ago: "The status quo and habits often bind people's minds tightly, and even revolutionaries sometimes cannot escape." The comrades of the Dazhai Party Branch should firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching and persistently struggle against the status quo and habits to keep moving forward and advancing forever.

Generally speaking, the work of the Dazhai Party Branch is relatively tightly grasped, and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have established the idea of farming for revolution, with everyone vying to work hard and work more. In this struggle to overcome the severe hailstorm and achieve a bumper harvest, it further prompted us to mobilize all positive factors. Not only did the elderly work hard, but students and teachers in schools also actively participated in labor. They turned the fields into classrooms and used the good deeds and good examples in the struggle against disasters as living teaching materials, teaching on the spot and applying what they learned. They were both students and laborers. These more than 100 students and teachers played a very good role in the struggle against the severe hailstorm. Community members praised, saying that this was inseparable from the Dazhai Party Branch's ideological work among students and teachers during the disaster. However, turning it around, isn't this a criticism of us for not managing the school well enough and not grasping the ideological education of students and teachers tightly enough, especially in times of smooth work? By comparing, we again saw the gaps in our work, educated cadres, enlightened community members, and found the direction for advancement.

Who can say that disasters are completely bad? The key is whether we can create conditions to turn negative factors into positive factors and turn bad things into good things.

Can bad things naturally turn into good things? No. In the old society, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai encountered many bad things. Not only did they suffer from natural disasters year after year, but more importantly, they suffered from man-made disasters every day. Landlords and rich peasants rode on our heads, and we toiled for them all year round. They sucked our blood dry and still tried to squeeze oil from our bones. The poor became poorer, and the rich became richer. Not a single bad thing turned into a good thing. This means that turning bad things into good things requires conditions. Without certain conditions, bad things will never turn into good things. Chairman Mao said: "...the correct ideology representing the advanced class, once grasped by the masses, will become a material force to transform society and the world." I understand that Chairman Mao's teaching explains the fundamental condition for turning bad things into good things. This condition is to actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought and carry out the ideological revolutionization of people. With people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, they can turn bad things into good things. The Dazhai Production Brigade overcame a severe flood disaster in 1963 and this year overcame a severe hailstorm. Moreover, each time a disaster was overcome, people's ideology and production appearance underwent a great change. The most fundamental thing was relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

It is easy to say that bad things can turn into good things, but it is not so easy to truly achieve this. The key issue is whether to apply what is learned from Chairman Mao's works. After suffering a severe disaster, the first problem we encountered was: Should we rely on self-reliance and hard work, or should we ask for help from above and rely on state support? This problem cannot be avoided. Chairman Mao teaches us: "We advocate self-reliance." To be self-reliant, we must endure hardships, work hard, and sweat a lot to overcome various difficulties. Asking for help from above and relying on state support may seem easier in the short term, but self-reliance is a policy that Chairman Mao has always advocated, and it has profound practical and far-reaching significance. Relying on external aid is not in line with Mao Zedong Thought and will increase the state's burden and bring negative consequences for ourselves. Can we insist on self-reliance? This is the question of whether to apply what is learned from Chairman Mao's works or not, and it is also the question of which line to follow. For many years, the Dazhai Production Brigade has firmly followed Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and insisted on the spirit of self-reliance. Since 1953, when the Dazhai Production Brigade borrowed 7,000 yuan from the state and repaid it in the same year, we have never borrowed money from the state or asked for anything. Insisting on self-reliance is more difficult during disasters. The Dazhai Production Brigade's insistence on the spirit of self-reliance is particularly evident in the face of severe disasters; it is also in overcoming severe disasters that we have tasted the sweetness of self-reliance. We do not want state relief, which reduces the state's burden and allows the state to use more manpower and resources for construction and support for the world revolution; we rely on self-reliance, and the results obtained through our own labor make us cherish them more, thus cultivating the good habit of thrift among cadres and community members; we started from scratch, worked hard, and tempered cadres and the broad masses of community members, especially cultivating a group of people who dare to fight against heaven, earth, and class enemies, and are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary cause.

Several years ago, Chairman Mao taught us: "The Yangtze River, everyone says it is very big, but in fact, big is not to be feared. The U.S. imperialists are not very big? We resisted them a bit, and it was nothing. So, some big things in the world are actually not to be feared." The facts have proven: Even major natural disasters are not to be feared. With Mao Zedong Thought, we can conquer them; in light disaster years, we can achieve bumper harvests, and in heavy disaster years, we can also achieve bumper harvests.

    在斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想大灾也能夺得大丰收
    陈永贵
    最近来自全国各地的许多同志，要我们谈谈大寨在今年遭受特大雹灾的情况下，是怎样获得丰收的？我们大寨党支部的同志认为：说千条道万条，靠毛泽东思想是第一条；这办法那办法，活学活用毛泽东思想就有用不完的办法。
    办法是在同困难作斗争中想出来的
    我们大寨今年受了两次灾。一是旱灾，一是雹灾。特别是七月间受的那场特大雹灾，不要说大寨的青年人没见过，就连七、八十岁的老人也没遇到过。当时大寨的七百多亩玉米和谷子，样样被砸，块块受灾。灾情是十分严重的。但是我们大寨党支部和广大贫下中农，牢记毛主席的教导：“我们的困难是能够克服的，因为我们是新兴的有光明前途的势力。”大寨人没有向困难低头，更没有唉声叹气。相反，信心百倍，干劲十足地向灾害展开顽强的斗争。
    很多谷苗被冰雹砸坏了，农业生产受季节限制，要毁掉再种是不可能的。这就促使我们想到一个问题：为了对付雹灾，不能光靠种好，还要能够栽活。冰雹灾害不象旱涝灾害面积那样广，我们就把没受雹灾的兄弟社队间出的谷苗栽在我们的谷田里。经过精心管理，今年的谷子获得了历史上没有过的好收成，亩产八百多斤，比大丰收的去年还增产百分之三十。这就使我们联想到：受灾时移栽谷苗成功，不受灾时不是同样可以移栽？先种上一季小麦，然后移栽谷苗，不就把一年一收变成为一年两收了吗？这样就可以做到既防止雹灾，又可以多增产细粮，更好地支援国家建设，支援世界革命。
    今年这场雹灾，还“帮助”我们解决了多少年来没有解决的一个问题。大寨的土地是摆在七沟八梁一面坡上。我们的沟洼地，在过去只种玉米，不种别的。原因是沟洼地到了雨季，山上的洪水下来，种别的作物是要被冲走的。只有玉米秆高，根又扎得深，可以经受得住。从我记事起就是种玉米，现在还是种玉米。由于多年种一季单项作物，不能改茬轮作，要提高这些沟地的产量受到一定的限制。现在有了移栽的经验，这些沟洼地今年也开始倒茬了，不少沟地现在已经种上了小麦。
    我们这样大胆地改革了旧的耕作制度，打破了多少年来的老规矩，是应该“感谢”雹灾的。正是雹灾逼迫着我们在一百二十亩谷田上进行了移栽谷苗的大面积试验，并且获得了成功。要不是这场雹灾，要改革旧的耕作制度，肯定还会遇到许多阻力哩！
    我们大寨今年不仅粮食丰收，蔬菜也获得大丰收。受雹灾后，干部和广大贫下中农社员，人人想办法，寸土必争，多种多收。充分利用路边、渠旁和一切空闲地，扩大种菜面积。今年收的菜，不仅可以满足社员的需要，而且可以卖给国家。
    这些事实都说明一个道理：自然灾害是坏事，但也是好事，它逼着我们打破了常规，想出了各种战胜困难的办法。从一九六一年以来，我们大寨大队经受了严重旱灾、风灾、虫灾、洪灾的考验，今年我们又战胜了严重雹灾。这就使我们在向自然灾害作斗争夺取丰收方面有了更多的办法。伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“一切新的东西都是从艰苦斗争中锻炼出来的。”“在共产党面前无困难，就是因为他能够克服困难。”我们战胜灾害的办法，就是活学活用毛泽东思想，在同困难作斗争中想出来的。在斗争中学习毛主席著作，学得深、用得活
    “毛泽东思想是宝中宝，干革命一时一刻离不了。”活学活用毛主席著作已经成为我们大寨大队干部和贫下中农生活的第一需要。但是，比较起来说，平时没有受灾时抓得紧，学得深，用得活。
    毛主席很早就教导我们说：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”毛主席的这一教导，许多人都会背过来。但是，在工作顺利的时候，往往体会得不那么深。在今年受到特大灾害时，洪水淹没了两户社员的窑洞，干部和社员一起，奋不顾身地跳进齐胸的水中，抢救社员的物资。在扶苗栽谷的那些日子里，干部和贫下中农人人争挑重担，六、七十岁的老人，七、八岁的儿童都上了阵。早晨四点钟就出工，晚上很晚才回来，一天劳动十三、四个小时。大家一个心眼，决心把雹灾造成的损失夺回来。这样，我们学习毛主席关于对待困难的教导，就不只是进一步理解了，更重要的是印在脑子里，落实在行动上。
    受了严重的雹灾，干部心里着急，作风紧张，雷厉风行，说干就干，毫不拖泥带水，要干什么就干出个结果来。群众觉悟高，干部抓得紧，战胜灾害的措施就及时、有力。玉米过去锄三遍，今年锄了四遍，过去追一次肥，今年追两次。今年样样工作提前，各项任务都完成得干净利落。这是什么原因呢？这就是毛主席在《党委会的工作方法》一文中教导我们的：“党委对主要工作不但一定要‘抓’，而且一定要‘抓紧’。什么东西只有抓得很紧，毫不放松，才能抓住。抓而不紧，等于不抓。”这样，干部就深刻体会到毛主席关于工作要“抓紧”的深刻意义。因此，战胜一次严重的灾害，干部的思想作风就提高一大步。
    林副主席指示我们：学习毛主席著作要“带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影。”我们在同灾害作斗争中学习毛主席著作，就是学了就用，边用边学，学用结合。有些同志赞扬大寨的贫下中农学习毛泽东思想，学到做到，不放空炮。所以能够这样，我认为这和我们年年同阶级敌人斗，同自然灾害斗，在斗争中学，在斗争中用是分不开的。
    灾害促使我们检查了工作，找到了差距
    这些年来，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，在毛主席发出的“农业学大寨”的伟大号召鼓舞下，以及在到大寨参观同志的促进下，我们大寨起了翻天覆地的变化。但是，我们大寨党支部的工作有没有缺点呢？还有哪些地方作得不够、急待改进呢？对于这个问题，党支部开过不少会，也进行过自我批评。但是，老实说，平日没有在遇到严重灾害时看得清、抓得准、改正的决心大。
    大寨的土地是不是可以比现在多种一些小麦？由过去种植占耕地面积的百分之五左右增加到百分之三、四十。这在受到特大雹灾前是有争论的。不少同志认为大寨地势高、气候冷，春天易冻，秋天降霜早，小麦产量低，扩大小麦种植面积会降低产量。这次雹灾“帮助”我们解决了这个问题。大家认识到：因为小麦收获得早，种小麦可以防雹、防洪；而且可以做到夏季受灾秋田补，秋季受灾来年夏田找，增种一部分小麦并不会降低产量。还有，我们大寨过去种谷是比较密的，每亩地有二万五千株左右，去年亩产达到六百斤，就觉得不错了。今年冰雹把谷苗打坏了，移栽的谷苗比往年减少百分之二十多，由于通风透光好，产量大大提高，这就又给我们上了生动的一课。我们大寨人年年破了一些旧框框，想出了一些新套套，听到的表扬话也是很多的。如果在受灾之前，有谁说我们有保守思想，我们听起来也许会觉得不顺耳。但是这场雹灾“帮助”我们认识到，我们头脑中确实有保守和不敢想、不敢说、不敢做的一面。在这个问题上没有，在那个问题上就可能有；在这段时间没有，在另一段时间就可能有。毛主席很早就说过：“现状和习惯往往容易把人们的头脑束缚得紧紧的，即使是革命者有时也不能免。”我们大寨党支部的同志应该牢牢记住毛主席的这一教导，同现状和习惯作坚持不懈的斗争，才能不断前进，永远前进。
    一般说来，我们大寨党支部的工作是抓得比较紧的，广大贫下中农都树立了为革命种田的思想，人人争出勤，多出勤。在这次战胜严重雹灾、夺取丰收的斗争中，又促使我们进一步把各种积极因素调动起来。不仅老人出勤，学校里的学生、教师也积极参加劳动。他们把田间当作课堂，把抗灾中的好人好事作为活的教材，就地教学，学了就用。既是学生，又是劳动者。这一百多名学生和教员，在战胜特大雹灾的斗争中起了很好的作用。社员们称赞说，这同大寨党支部在抗灾中抓紧了学生和教师的政治思想工作是分不开的。但是，反过来想一想，这不正是批评我们平时、特别是在顺利的情况下，对学校管理得还不够，对学生、教员的政治思想教育抓得还不够紧吗？这样一想一比，就又看出了我们工作中的差距，教育了干部，启发了社员，找到了前进的方向。
    谁能说灾害完全是坏事呢？问题在于我们能不能创造条件，把消极因素变为积极因素，把坏事变成好事。
    坏事变成好事的根本是人的思想革命化
    坏事，会自然地变成好事吗？不能。在旧社会，我们大寨贫下中农遭遇的坏事多极了。不仅是年年受天灾，更重要的是天天有人祸。地主、富农骑在我们头上，我们终年为他们当牛作马。他们把我们的血吸干了，还要从骨头渣子里榨出油来。穷的越穷，富的越富。那一件坏事，也没有变成好事。这就是说，坏事变好事要有条件。没有一定的条件，坏事永远变不成好事。毛主席说：“……代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。”我体会，毛主席的这个教导就说明了坏事变好事的根本条件。这个条件就是活学活用毛泽东思想，搞好人的思想革命化。有了用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，就能把坏事变成好事。我们大寨大队在一九六三年战胜了特大洪灾，今年又战胜了特大雹灾，而且战胜一次灾害，人的思想和生产面貌就发生一次大变化，最根本的是靠了战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    坏事可以变成好事，说起来容易，但是真正做到并不那么容易。关键问题就在于学了毛主席著作要去用。受到严重灾害后，首先遇到的一个问题是：靠自力更生，艰苦奋斗；还是向上伸手，靠国家支援？这个问题谁也回避不了。毛主席教导我们说：“我们是主张自力更生的。”要自力更生，就要吃大苦，耐大劳，付出大量的汗水，克服种种困难。向上伸手，靠国家支援，从眼前看，自己可能省些力，比较容易度过眼前的困难。但是，自力更生是毛主席一贯提倡的方针，坚持自力更生有深刻的现实意义和深远意义；依靠外力援助，是不符合毛泽东思想的，既增加了国家负担，又会给自己带来不良后果。能不能坚持自力更生，这就是学了毛主席著作用还是不用的问题，也是执行什么路线的问题。多年以来，大寨大队是坚决执行毛主席的革命路线，坚持发扬自力更生精神的。我们大寨大队从一九五三年向国家贷款七千元当年还清后，再没有向国家借过钱，也没有要过东西。坚持自力更生在受灾时要比平时困难。我们大寨大队坚持自力更生的精神，突出地表现在遇到特大灾害的时候；也正是在战胜特大灾害中尝到了自力更生的甜头。我们不要国家救济，减轻了国家的负担，可以使国家把更多的物力财力用于建设和支援世界革命；我们依靠自力更生，经过自己双手劳动得来的成果，更加知道爱惜，这就养成了干部、社员勤俭节约的好习惯；我们白手起家，艰苦奋斗，就锻炼了干部和广大社员，特别是培养出一批敢于同天斗、同地斗、同阶级敌人斗，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    几年以前，毛主席就教导我们说：“长江，别人都说很大，其实，大，并不可怕。美帝国主义不是很大吗？我们顶了他一下，也没有啥。所以，世界上有些大的东西，其实并不可怕。”事实证明：大的自然灾害也并没有什么可怕。有了毛泽东思想，就能制服它；轻灾年能获得大丰收，大灾年也能夺得大丰收。
