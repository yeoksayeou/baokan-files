One evening, the publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party sparked a wave of excitement in Taoyuan Brigade of Luwangzhuang People's Commune, Lufeng County, Hebei Province. After listening to the broadcast, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres took to the streets. Groups of marching people held up portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao, carried red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and paraded through the streets and alleys, shouting joyfully. Slogans such as "Heartily welcome the successful convening of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party!" "Firmly support the decision of the plenary session to expel Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" and "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" echoed through the night sky of Taoyuan.

The traitor, internal spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi once used Taoyuan Brigade as a black experimental ground for his attempt to restore capitalism. He sent his wife to Taoyuan to madly push the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, ruthlessly suppressing and persecuting the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Taoyuan. The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Taoyuan have deep class hatred for Liu Shaoqi. When they heard from the broadcast that the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party decided to expel Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever, everyone was overjoyed and shouted with excitement, saying, "Expelling the big villain Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever is truly a great relief!" The late Deputy Secretary of the Taoyuan Party Branch, Zhao Shuzhen, was persecuted to death by Liu Shaoqi and his wife. When Zhao's wife heard the news of Liu Shaoqi being expelled from the Party forever, she was so moved that tears welled up in her eyes. Despite her serious illness, she got off the kang (bed) and led her three children to stand in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" She told her children that Chairman Mao had saved their whole family for the second time. You must always remember what your father told you before he died: to listen to Chairman Mao's words generation after generation and follow Chairman Mao to make revolution!

The night was already deep. The brigade meeting room, various Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and many peasant households were still brightly lit. People were studying, discussing, and making resolutions; some were writing big-character posters, exposing and criticizing Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes in Taoyuan. The poor and lower-middle peasants said, the great proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao has thoroughly smashed the bourgeois headquarters represented by Liu Shaoqi and his agents in various places, saving us from the suffering of capitalist restoration. The debt of gratitude we owe to Chairman Mao is greater than the sky and earth. Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao. We must read Chairman Mao's books better, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and follow Chairman Mao to make revolution to the end. Everyone expressed in the discussion that they would hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, use the actual actions of carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation to welcome the successful convening of the Ninth National Congress of the Party. They would firmly carry out the great call of the plenary session, unite around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and seize the comprehensive victory of the proletarian cultural revolution, letting the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly high and forever in Taoyuan.

    桃园社员愤怒声讨刘少奇滔天罪行
    一日晚，党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的发表，在河北省抚宁县卢王庄公社桃园大队激起一片欢腾。刚刚听完广播的广大贫下中农和革命干部，纷纷走上街头，一队队游行的群众，高举伟大领袖毛主席的画像，手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，穿街过巷，纵情欢呼。“热烈欢呼党的八届扩大的十二中全会胜利召开！”“坚决拥护全会把刘少奇永远开除出党！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！”的口号声，久久地回荡在桃园的夜空。
    叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇曾把桃园大队当作他妄图复辟资本主义的黑试验场，他派他的老婆来桃园疯狂地推行反革命修正主义路线，残酷地压制、迫害桃园的贫下中农和革命干部。桃园的贫下中农和革命干部对刘少奇有刻骨的阶级仇恨，当他们从广播里听到党的八届十二中全会决定把刘少奇永远开除出党时，人人高兴得欢呼雀跃，都说：“把大坏蛋刘少奇永远开除出党，真是大快人心！”原桃园党支部副书记赵树椿就是被刘少奇和他的老婆迫害致死的。赵树椿的老伴听到把刘少奇永远开除出党的喜讯时，激动得热泪盈眶。她不顾重病，爬下炕来，领着三个孩子站在毛主席像前，高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”她对孩子们说，是毛主席第二次救了咱全家。你们要永远记住你们的爸爸临死前告诉你们的话：要辈辈听毛主席的话，跟着毛主席干革命！
    夜已经很深了。大队会议室、各个院户毛泽东思想学习班和许多社员家里，依然灯光明亮。人们在学习、座谈和表决心；有的在写大字报，对刘少奇在桃园犯下的滔天罪行进行大揭发、大批判。贫下中农们说，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动、亲自领导的无产阶级文化大革命，彻底摧毁了以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级司令部和他在各地的代理人，使我们免受资本主义复辟的苦，真是天大地大不如毛主席的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，我们一定要更好地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，跟着毛主席革命到底。大家在座谈中一致表示，要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，用搞好斗、批、改的实际行动，迎接党的九大的胜利召开。要坚决执行全会发出的伟大号召，团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗在桃园高高飘扬，永远飘扬。
