In the struggle to fully implement the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Twelfth Session of the Party, the important editorial "Seriously Study the History of the Struggle Between the Two Lines" published by the *People's Daily*, *Red Flag* magazine, and the *Liberation Army Daily*, which conveys Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the re-publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant document "Report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China," has greatly inspired the working class of Shanghai. This has pushed the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong Thought in Shanghai to a broader and deeper new stage. In this vigorous learning movement, the workers, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, seriously study the historical experience of the struggle between the two lines, thoroughly criticize and purge the counter-revolutionary revisionist thoughts of Liu Shaoqi, continuously raise their class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness, and rapidly advance the revolutionary criticism, struggle, and reform.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Historical experience is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, should be repeatedly emphasized. It is not enough to tell a few people; the broad revolutionary masses must know about it." The heroic working class of Shanghai, after more than two years of severe tests in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, deeply understands: the tens of millions of revolutionary masses overthrowing the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi and a handful of diehard capitalist-roaders within the party rely on Mao Zedong Thought; consolidating the newly born revolutionary committees and exercising power correctly also rely on Mao Zedong Thought. Every step forward by the proletarian revolutionaries, every victory achieved, is due to the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The workers say, Chairman Mao trusts us workers, peasants, and soldiers the most, we listen to Chairman Mao's words the most, and we love reading Chairman Mao's books the most. If we study Chairman Mao's books well and apply them effectively, our class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness will be raised; if we follow Chairman Mao's instructions to the letter and implement them, we will have a direction for revolution. Currently, we must deeply carry out the learning movement of the history of the struggle between the two lines, use Mao Zedong Thought to unify our thinking, steps, and actions, which is the fundamental guarantee for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The distinctive feature of the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought among the working class of Shanghai is to place the learning, propaganda, and implementation of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Twelfth Session of the Party and the history of the struggle between the two lines in the foremost position. The workers say, Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee is a great program for establishing and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and building socialism, and a sharp ideological weapon against revisionism and "left" and "right" opportunist lines. The important editorial of the two newspapers and one magazine also conveys Chairman Mao's latest instructions, pointing out the revolutionary direction for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The communiqué of the Twelfth Plenum of the Party is a crystallization of great Mao Zedong Thought. Fully implementing the communiqué is the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Many revolutionary rebel workers from Shanghai No. 17 Cotton Mill, Shanghai Valve No. 1 Factory, Shanghai Port No. 7 District, Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, Dongfanghong Shipyard, and Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory closely combine the learning of Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, the important editorial of the two newspapers and one magazine "Seriously Study the History of the Struggle Between the Two Lines," and the implementation of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Twelfth Session of the Party. They link this with the history of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in Shanghai and their factories over the past two years, review the tremendous changes before and after the proletarian revolutionaries took power, and feel even more deeply that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated by Chairman Mao has profound political significance. They further understand Chairman Mao's great teachings that "this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is completely necessary and very timely for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist restoration, and building socialism." Through the comparison between the old and new societies and the changes before and after the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of workers have even more ardent love for the great leader Chairman Mao. The workers enthusiastically praise Chairman Mao's great achievements and the great merits of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin.

Another distinctive feature of the new high tide of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought among the working class of Shanghai is to learn and apply in the struggle, using Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful ideological weapon to launch more fierce attacks on the class enemies. Chairman Mao said: "Winning nationwide victory is only the first step in the Long March of ten thousand li.... The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and the struggle is more arduous." The working class of Shanghai remembers Chairman Mao's teachings, with the revolutionary spirit of beating a fallen enemy, further deepens the revolutionary criticism, and is determined to thoroughly purge the counter-revolutionary revisionist poison spread by Liu Shaoqi and expose all the hidden class enemies. Many factory workers make full use of Liu Shaoqi as a negative example, deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and in the revolutionary criticism, seriously study the historical experience of the struggle between the two lines within the party, learn Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions well, further arm themselves with Chairman Mao's theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and raise their class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness. The workers say, Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is our line, Mao Zedong Thought's views on class and class struggle are our views. Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the lifeline of us workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the red line to communism. We must resolutely criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary black line and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary red line to the death.

Currently, the situation in Shanghai is better than ever. The working class of Shanghai is determined to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, achieve new victories in the struggle, criticism, and reform, and achieve new victories in achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Follow the great commander Chairman Mao and march forward bravely!

    毛主席最新指示和在七届二中全会上的报告鼓舞了广大人民群众
    上海工人阶级认真学习两条路线斗争史
    他们以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，彻底批判和肃清刘少奇的反革命修正主义思想，把斗批改迅速推向前进
    本报讯　在全面落实党的八届十二中全会公报的战斗中，《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》的重要社论《认真学习两条路线斗争的历史》传达的毛主席最新指示和毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》这一光辉文献的重新发表，极大地鼓舞了上海工人阶级，把上海活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动推向更加广泛、深入的新阶段。在这场蓬勃开展的学习运动中，工人们以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为强大的思想武器，认真学习两条路线斗争的历史经验，彻底批判和肃清刘少奇的反革命修正主义思想，不断提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，把革命大批判和斗、批、改迅速推向前进。
    毛主席最近指出：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”英雄的上海工人阶级，经过两年多无产阶级文化大革命的严峻考验，深深懂得：亿万革命群众打倒叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇和党内一小撮顽固不化的走资派，靠的是毛泽东思想；巩固新生的革命委员会，掌好权、用好权，同样靠的是毛泽东思想。无产阶级革命派每前进一步，所取得的每一个胜利，都是靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想和毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引。工人们说，毛主席最相信我们工农兵群众，我们最听毛主席的话，最爱读毛主席的书。毛主席的书学得活、用得好，阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟就提得高；毛主席的指示句句照办，条条落实，干革命就有了方向。当前，更要深入开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动，用毛泽东思想来统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，这是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的最根本的保证。
    把学习、宣传、落实党的八届十二中全会公报和两条路线斗争史的学习放在首要地位，是上海工人阶级活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动的显著特点。工人们说，毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告，是建立和巩固无产阶级专政、建设社会主义的伟大纲领，是反对修正主义，反对“左”、右倾机会主义路线的锐利的思想武器。中央两报一刊的重要社论，又传达了毛主席的最新指示，给我们指明了夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的革命航向。党的十二中全会公报是伟大的毛泽东思想的结晶。全面落实公报，就是无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。上海国棉十七厂、上海阀门一厂、上港七区、上钢三厂、东方红造船厂、上海柴油机厂等工厂的许多革命造反派工人，都把学习毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告，学习两报一刊《认真学习两条路线斗争的历史》的重要社论和贯彻党的八届十二中全会公报紧密地结合起来。他们联系上海、联系本厂两年多来两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的历史，回顾了无产阶级革命派掌权前后翻天覆地的巨大变化，格外亲切地感受到毛主席亲自发动的这场伟大的无产阶级文化大革命具有深远的政治意义，进一步领会了毛主席关于“这次无产阶级文化大革命，对于巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义，是完全必要的，是非常及时的”的伟大教导。广大工人群众通过新旧社会的对比，通过无产阶级文化大革命前后的变化，更加激发起对伟大领袖毛主席的无比热爱。工人们热烈赞颂毛主席的丰功伟绩，热烈赞颂以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的巨大功勋。
    上海工人阶级活学活用毛泽东思想新高潮的又一个特点是：在斗争中学，在斗争中用，以毛泽东思想为强大的思想武器，主动地向阶级敌人发动更为猛烈的进攻。毛主席说：“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。……中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。”上海工人阶级牢记毛主席的教导，以痛打落水狗的革命精神，进一步深入开展革命大批判，决心彻底肃清刘少奇所散布的反革命修正主义流毒，把隐藏的一小撮阶级敌人统统挖出来。许多工厂工人充分利用刘少奇这个反面教员，深入开展革命大批判，批判刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，在革命大批判中，认真学习党内两条路线斗争的历史经验，学好毛主席一系列最新指示，进一步用毛主席关于在无产阶级专政下继续革命的学说武装起来，提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟。工人说，毛主席的革命路线就是我们的路线，毛泽东思想关于阶级和阶级斗争的观点就是我们的观点。毛主席的革命路线是我们工农兵的生命线，是通向共产主义的红线。我们要狠批刘少奇的反革命黑线，誓死捍卫毛主席的革命红线。
    当前，上海形势空前大好。上海工人阶级决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在斗、批、改中立新功，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利中立新功。紧跟伟大统帅毛主席奋勇前进！
