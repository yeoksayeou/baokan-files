The U.S. imperialists, in order to meet their anti-communist and anti-China needs, have dispatched a so-called "U.S. Defense Liaison Group" to Indonesia to engage in extensive activities, directing the Indonesian reactionary army to hasten the construction of aggressive military facilities.

According to the Indonesian official mouthpiece, the Antara News Agency, a high-ranking U.S. Defense Department official, Shepard, recently made a special "inspection" visit to Indonesia to oversee the work of the "Defense Liaison Group" that had already been sent there. This U.S. military official, in a conversation with reporters from this news agency, frankly admitted that the "U.S. Defense Liaison Group" was "sent by the U.S. government," and its mission was to "assist and guide" the Indonesian reactionary army in the construction of aggressive military facilities.

This news agency reported that Shepard, on the 12th, "inspected" some engineering projects of the Indonesian Army Corps of Engineers, including bridges and special engineering training centers. The report said that Shepard "expressed admiration" for the achievements of the Indonesian Army Corps of Engineers.

According to another report from the Indonesian "Armed Forces News," a member of the "U.S. Defense Liaison Group," Thompson, in October, had "inspected" military engineering projects in South Sulawesi. The commander of the South Sulawesi Military Region, Saidiman, "explained" the progress of local military engineering to this American military officer. This reactionary newspaper shamelessly stated that the United States, as the country providing the "largest aid" to the Indonesian reactionary army, "must understand" the military engineering in South Sulawesi.

As the fascist military regime in Indonesia becomes increasingly treacherous in its sell-out policies, U.S. imperialism has already established three military bases in Indonesia. Now, the so-called "U.S. Defense Liaison Group" is openly active in Indonesia, directing the Indonesian reactionary army to hasten the construction of aggressive military facilities. All this further indicates that Indonesia, under the fascist military regime of Suharto-Nasution, has become a bridgehead for U.S. imperialist aggression in Asia.

    美帝指挥印尼反动派修建侵略性军事工程
    由法西斯军人政权统治的印尼，已沦为美帝侵略亚洲的桥头堡
    新华社二十六日讯　雅加达消息：美帝国主义为了反共反华的需要，派出了所谓“美国防务联络小组”到印度尼西亚进行大肆活动，指挥印尼反动军队加紧修建侵略性军事工程。
    据印尼官方喉舌安塔拉通讯社透露，美国国防部高级军官谢泼德最近专门到印尼“视察”了这个早已派往印尼的“防务联络小组”的工作。这个美国军官在对这家通讯社的记者发表谈话时毫不掩饰地供认，“美国防务联络小组”是由“美国政府派遣的”，它的任务是“协助和指导”印尼反动军队修建侵略性军事工程。
    这家通讯社说，谢泼德十二日“视察了印尼陆军工程兵的一些工程”，其中有桥梁和工兵特别训练中心等。消息说，谢泼德“对（印尼）陆军工程兵团所取得的工作成绩表示钦佩”。
    另据印尼《武装部队报》透露，“美国防务联络小组”成员汤普森十月间曾到南苏拉威西“视察”了当地的军事工程。南苏拉威西军区司令萨伊迪曼向这个美国军官“说明”了当地军事工程的进展情况。这家反动报纸厚颜无耻地说，美国作为向印尼反动军队提供“最大援助”的一个国家，“必须了解”南苏拉威西的军事工程。
    随着印尼法西斯军人政权变本加厉地实行卖国政策，美帝国主义已经在印尼建立了三个军事基地。现在，所谓“美国防务联络小组”又在印尼公开活动，指挥印尼反动军队加紧修建侵略性军事工程。这一切进一步表明，由苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权统治的印度尼西亚，已经沦为美帝国主义侵略亚洲的一个桥头堡。
