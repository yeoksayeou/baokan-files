In the Altay grasslands of Xinjiang, two stories of Kazakh herdsmen actively learning and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts are circulating. These two individuals are heroes nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, daring to struggle against heaven, earth, and class enemies. One is named Ouerken, and the other is Hamila.

The New Yu Gong of the Pasture

Ouerken, over sixty years old, often tells people, "I read Chairman Mao's books every day and think of Chairman Mao every day." When he says these two sentences, he always looks happy, revealing boundless joy. He also often says, "In the past, I had nothing to eat and nothing to wear. The great leader Chairman Mao saved me from the ice cave, and I have today's happy life." The old herdsman Ouerken is illiterate. For more than ten years, he has completely relied on others' help to learn Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles" and other brilliant works, sentence by sentence. He learns and then applies. The more he studies the "Three Constantly Read Articles," the more he feels that his later years are precious and should be spent like the old Yu Gong, doing more good deeds for the people. Therefore, year after year, month after month, he always drives the livestock to places where others dare not go to graze, or spends the winter in places with poor water and grass, leaving the areas with abundant water and grass for others.

Last winter and this spring, Ouerken spent his fifth year herding in Batutieke. This place has little water and sparse grass, and every year they have to go to the mountains fifty miles away to fetch grass to feed the sheep. This time, he decided to use the spirit of Yu Gong digging the mountain every day to dig out the spring water to irrigate the pasture.

His proposal initially met with opposition from his wife, Bogaidi. She said, "Where there is water, we go there, let's follow the old rules! Opening a spring and digging a canal is not your business, the higher-ups will send people to do it." Ouerken told Bogaidi, "The sheep given to us by Chairman Mao, we can't just lie down and herd them! Yu Gong can move mountains, can't we dig out a spring of water!"

After saying this, he arranged for his wife to take care of the household, his eldest son to herd the sheep, and he led his three children, aged eight, nine, and ten, with three tools: a shovel, a pickaxe, and an iron rod, to start digging the spring and canal on a relatively moist hillside. Every morning, they start work early. Ouerken holds high the portrait of Chairman Mao, striding forward, with the three children following in a line, father and sons together wishing Chairman Mao eternal life and reading aloud from Chairman Mao's quotations.

At that time, the Altay Mountains were covered with ice and snow, and the cold wind pierced the bones. In a few days, Ouerken's fingernails fell off, and both of his hands were cracked. At this time, passersby had different opinions. Some people said to them, "Opening a mountain and digging a spring requires dynamite, just relying on a pickaxe may not work." Some people encouraged them, believing that their wish could succeed. Every time people doubted or wished them well, Ouerken would say, "Chairman Mao led the poor to seize power, enduring countless hardships! Digging a spring and building a canal, what's the big deal? If I can't dig out water this year, I'll dig next year. If it doesn't work next year, there's still the year after!"

After more than fifty days, the mountain spring gushed out water, and a canal three feet wide and nearly a mile long was built. That night, the whole family was so happy that they couldn't sleep. Bogaidi stood by the canal, looking at the spring water flowing, criticizing and repenting her own conservatism, and praising the boundless power of the "Three Constantly Read Articles"!

The news of digging the spring and canal spread, and many people came to congratulate them. At this time, Bogaidi boiled a pot of the strongest milk tea for everyone, and Ouerken had a fourteen-year-old child read a quotation from Chairman Mao: "We are not only good at destroying an old world, we will also be good at building a new world." Finally, Ouerken spoke with deep feelings, "Our ancestors have been running after water and grass, never thinking of transforming nature. Only Mao Zedong Thought gave me the courage and determination. Now I understand that following Chairman Mao's instructions, there is no wish that cannot be realized."

The Little Hero of the Thousand-Mile Grasslands

At the age of sixteen, Hamila began to use Mao Zedong Thought to guide her herding at the age of thirteen. Such a young girl herding alone on the grasslands here is unprecedented.

Hamila lost her father in her childhood and was often sick. She never went to school. Over the years, she asked more than forty people to help her learn Chairman Mao's works, memorizing the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and more than eighty quotations from Chairman Mao. She learns and then applies, following Chairman Mao's words and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

In the winter of 1965, Hamila's mother and her brother and sister-in-law were all sick, and the only one who could go out was Hamila, then only thirteen years old. At this time, her mother thought that the places where their family had to herd were all high mountains and deserts, far and dangerous. To prevent the collective property from being damaged, it would be better to return the flock to the production team.

But Hamila disagreed. She said, "When Dad died, he told us to remember that it was Chairman Mao who saved us and brought us a happy life. We must always listen to Chairman Mao's words and follow Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao said, 'Our comrades should see achievements and light in times of difficulty, and raise our courage.' Our family's difficulties can be overcome. Although I am young, I must take up the herding whip."

The production team saw that the responsibility of a flock of sheep fell on the shoulders of a thirteen-year-old girl and was afraid she couldn't handle it, deciding to assign someone to help her. Hamila still disagreed, saying, "I have Chairman Mao's books with me, please believe I can complete the task." From then on, she guarded the flock at night and, as soon as dawn broke, she put on her red book bag, drove the flock out to graze. She has been doing this every day since she was thirteen. The herdsmen were moved to say, "People armed with Mao Zedong Thought, no matter how old, have the greatest strength!"

That year, the commune's flock expanded greatly, and the original pastures were not enough for grazing, so many new pastures had to be opened. Hamila was arranged to go to a desert where no sheep had ever wintered. This place is flat, with many stones and little grass, and the wind and snow come easily, making it difficult for the sheep to stand. A bad person who infiltrated the herdsmen's team spoke up, "A place where wild horses don't enter, eagles don't fly, and even dogs can't be tied, can a little girl stand there?" Hamila immediately retorted, "With Chairman Mao leading, I can take root on an ice mountain!"

Hamila drove the flock to this stony desert, and as soon as she arrived, she told the more than twenty herdsmen who came with her about Chairman Mao's teaching of "making up your mind, not fearing sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," encouraging everyone to fight against difficulties. Seeing that Hamila studied Chairman Mao's works, combined them with reality, and used them well, everyone elected her to lead them. Little Hamila did not disappoint everyone's expectations. She led everyone to dig out stones from the snow to build pens and to carry manure on felt blankets from more than ten miles away to pad the pens. In two months, they turned this place where sheep did not winter into a winter pasture.

That year, the four hundred sheep she herded were fat and healthy and survived the winter. The bad guy who always picked the best pastures only brought back a whip after a wind and snowstorm. He still argued, "This is the work of Hu Da (God), it's not my fault!" Hamila immediately exposed this bad guy's plot to shift blame with the facts of her and the other herdsmen's victory over the great wind and snow. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Hamila and other community members expelled this bad person from the herdsmen's team and implemented dictatorship over him.

Last summer, Hamila herded to the back of the Kehan Mountains, where the water and grass were abundant and the wild animals were few. A community member herded on the front mountain, where the slope was steep and the forest was deep, and bears often came to eat sheep. In one summer, this herdsman lost five sheep to bears. This summer, this herdsman said he would not go to the front mountain to herd no matter what. Hamila knew and took the initiative to swap places with him. Someone knew about this and said Hamila did a foolish thing. Hamila said, "Chairman Mao teaches us that 'the decisive factor is people, not things.' With Chairman Mao's teachings, why fear bears!" Hamila went to the front mountain and did not leave the flock day or night. The bears often came near the flock at night, but they were all scared away by the brave and loud shouting of the little girl Hamila.

In late June of this year, Hamila drove the flock to a new pasture—a big mountain—and passed through a deep and narrow mountain gorge. A lamb fell into a crevice. After walking more than twenty miles, Hamila found that the lamb was missing. She decided to let her family drive the flock forward and return alone to find it. At that time, the herdsmen who were traveling with her advised her, "It's almost dark, and there are many wild animals in the gorge. What's the big deal about a lamb, don't go!" Hamila said, "I can't forget Chairman Mao's words, to serve the people 'completely' and 'thoroughly'." She returned alone for more than twenty miles, entered the mountain gorge, found the lamb, and then hurried back to the flock at night. People asked her where she got so much courage, and she smiled and said, "What's there to fear? I only thought of Chairman Mao's teachings, to herd the sheep well for the revolution, and didn't think about anything scary."

    红日照边疆　草原新人多
    在新疆阿勒太草原上，流传着两个哈萨克牧羊人活学活用毛泽东思想的故事。这两个人都是毛泽东思想哺育出来的敢于同天斗、同地斗、同阶级敌人斗的英雄人物。一个叫奥吾肯，一个叫哈米拉。
    牧场上的新愚公
    年过六旬的奥吾肯常对人们说：“我天天读毛主席的书，天天想念毛主席。”他说这两句话的时候，总是乐滋滋的，流露着无限幸福的心情。他还常说：“我过去吃没吃的，穿没穿的。伟大领袖毛主席把我从冰窟窿里救出来，我才有今天的幸福生活。”老牧人奥吾肯是个文盲，十几年来，他完全靠别人帮助，一句一句地学习毛主席的“老三篇”等光辉著作。他学了就用。他越学习“老三篇”，越感到晚年的时光宝贵，应该以老愚公为榜样，来度过自己的晚年，多为人民做好事。因此，年年月月，他总是把牲畜赶到别人不敢去的地方放牧，或是在水草差的地方过冬，把水草多的放牧区让给别人。
    去冬今春，奥吾肯第五个年头游牧到巴图特热克地方。这儿水少草稀，每年都得到五十里以外的山上打草喂羊。这回，他决心要用愚公每天挖山不止的精神，挖出浇灌草场的泉水来。
    他的主张，开始遭到了妻子波加依的反对。她说：“那儿有水那儿走，还是照老规矩办吧！要开泉挖渠也不是你的事，上面自会派人来的。”奥吾肯对波加依说：“毛主席交给我们的羊，我们可不能躺着放啊！愚公能移山，我们还不能挖出股水来！？”
    说罢，他安排妻子料理家务，大儿子去放羊，自己率领八、九、十岁的三个孩子，带着铁锨、铁镐和铁棍三件工具，在一块较潮湿的山坡上，开泉挖渠了。每日清早上工，奥吾肯高举着毛主席的画像阔步在前，三个孩子列队在后，父子共同敬祝毛主席万寿无疆，同声朗读毛主席语录。
    那时，阿尔泰山，冰封雪盖，寒风刺骨，没有几天，奥吾肯的指甲碰掉了，两手全都冻裂了口子。这时候，来往的过路人，有的向他们父子说：“开山挖泉得有雷管炸药，光凭十字镐恐怕不行吧？”有人鼓励他们父子，相信他们的愿望能够成功。每当人们疑惑或是祝愿的时候，奥吾肯就说：“毛主席领导穷人夺天下，经过多大的千辛万苦啊！挖个泉，修条渠，算个啥？我今年挖不出水明年挖，明年不成还有后年哩！”
    时间过去五十多天，山泉冒水了，一条宽三尺、长近一里的水渠修成了，泉水沿着大渠淌进了草地。这一夜，全家高兴得都没睡觉。波加依激动地站在渠边，望着泉水斗私批修，一面检讨自己怕困难，太保守，一面连声称赞“老三篇”的无穷威力！
    挖泉开渠的消息传开了，许多人都来祝贺。这时，波加依为大伙儿烧了一壶最浓的奶茶，奥吾肯叫来十四岁的孩子给大家念了毛主席的一条语录：“我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”末了，奥吾肯深有感受地讲：“我们祖祖辈辈朝着水草跑，那里还想到改造自然呢。毛泽东思想才使我有了志气和胆量，如今我懂得了，照毛主席的指示办事，就没有实现不了的愿望。”
    千里草原小英雄
    十六岁的哈米拉，在十三岁的时候就开始用毛泽东思想指导放羊。这么小小年纪的女孩子，单独放牧，在这儿的草原上，是从来没有过的事。
    哈米拉幼年丧父，童年多病，没上过学。几年来，她求四十多个人帮助，学习毛主席著作，背会了“老三篇”和毛主席的八十多条语录。她学了就用，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。
    一九六五年冬天，哈米拉的母亲和兄、嫂都病了，能出门的只有当时才十三岁的哈米拉。这时，她妈妈想，她们家放牧要走的地方，都是高山和戈壁，又远又险。为了不叫集体的财产受到损失，还是把一群羊退回生产队去好。
    可是哈米拉不依。她说：“大大（爸爸）死的时候说过，要我们记住，是毛主席救了我们，是毛主席给我们带来了幸福生活，要我们啥时候都要听毛主席的话，跟毛主席走。毛主席说：‘我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。’我们家的困难是能够克服的，我虽然年纪小，也要接过放羊的鞭子。”
    生产队见一群羊的担子落在一个十三岁的小女孩肩上，怕她受不了，决定配备一个人给她帮忙。哈米拉还是不依，她说：“我有毛主席的书在身边，请相信我能完成任务。”从此，她晚上跟羊群守夜，天刚破晓，又背起红色书包，赶着羊群出牧，她从十三岁起，天天这样，年年如此。牧民们感动地说：“用毛泽东思想武装的人，不管大小，都有最大的力量！”
    这年，公社的羊群大发展，原有的草场不够放牧，得新开辟许多草场。哈米拉被安排到一个从没有羊过冬的戈壁。这儿一马平川，石多草稀，风来雪到，羊根本站不住。有个混到牧民队伍中的坏人说话了：“野马不进、山鹰不飞、狗都拴不住的地方，一个小丫头能站得住吗？”哈米拉听了，马上回击道：“有毛主席领导，我在冰山上也能扎根！”
    哈米拉赶着羊群，一到这石多草稀的戈壁滩上，就把毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，告诉给同来的二十多个牧民，鼓励大家向困难作斗争。大家见哈米拉学习毛主席著作，结合实际，用得好，就推选她来领导大家。小哈米拉没有辜负大家的期望，她领着大家，在雪里刨出石头垒圈，到十几里外的地方用毡子背来羊粪垫圈。花了两个月时间，把这个冬天不放羊的地方，建成了冬牧场。
    这年，她放牧的四百只羊，体肥膘满，过了冬。那个专挑好草场的坏家伙，一群羊经过一场风雪，只带了根鞭子回来。他还狡辩说：“这是胡大（上帝）的事，怪不得我！”哈米拉当场用自己以及和她一起的牧民战胜大风雪的事实，揭露了这个坏蛋推脱罪行的阴谋。在无产阶级文化大革命中，哈米拉和其他社员们一起，从牧民队伍中清除了这个坏人，对他实行了专政。
    去年夏天，哈米拉游牧到却汗后山，这儿水草丰茂，兽害很少。有一个社员在前山放牧，那里坡陡林深，熊瞎子常来吃羊，一个夏天，这个牧民放的羊就被叼走了五只。今年夏天，这个牧民说什么也不到前山放羊。哈米拉知道了，就主动地找他换了地方。有人知道这件事以后，说哈米拉办了件傻事。哈米拉却说，毛主席教导我们：“决定的因素是人不是物。”有毛主席的教导，还怕熊瞎子干么！哈米拉到了前山，日夜不离羊群。熊瞎子虽然夜里常常跑到羊群附近，但都被小姑娘哈米拉勇敢宏亮的吆喝声吓得逃跑了。
    今年六月下旬，哈米拉赶着羊群向新牧场——一座大山上转移，路过一条林深路隘的山沟，一只羊羔子掉到石缝里。走了二十多里，哈米拉发现羊羔丢了，她决定叫家里人赶着羊群前进，自己回头去找。当时，同行的牧民劝她说：“天快黑了，沟内野兽又多，一只羊羔子有啥要紧的，别去了！”哈米拉说：“毛主席的话不能忘，为人民服务要‘完全’‘彻底’”。她一个人毅然返回二十里，钻进山沟，找到了那只羊羔，而后又星夜赶上了羊群。人们问她为什么有这么大的胆量，她笑嘻嘻地说：“怕啥？我只想到毛主席的教导，为革命把羊放好，没有想到有什么可怕的。”
