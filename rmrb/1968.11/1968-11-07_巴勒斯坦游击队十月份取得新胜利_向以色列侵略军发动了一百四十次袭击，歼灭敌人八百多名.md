Palestinian guerrillas achieved new victories in October, launching 140 attacks against Israeli aggressor forces and eliminating more than 800 enemy personnel.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Damascus, "Fatah" (Palestinian National Liberation Movement) and the Palestine Liberation Organization issued separate comprehensive battle reports on October 2, stating that Palestinian guerrillas achieved new great victories in their brave battles against Israeli aggressor forces this month.

The "Fatah" battle report stated, "The Storm" assault teams launched 110 consecutive attacks against Israeli aggressors on occupied Arab lands in October, killing and wounding approximately 600 Israeli aggressors, destroying five Israeli observation posts and ten strongholds, including an Israeli officers' club near the Dead Sea. They also destroyed 20 tanks and mine-clearing vehicles, 88 military vehicles, 14 artillery pieces, and seized five artillery pieces of various calibers. The assault teams also blew up the main building of an Israeli international airport, as well as six sections of railway and bridges, several oil tanks and pipelines, and two large factories.

The Palestine Liberation Organization's battle report stated that its affiliated guerrilla teams launched 30 attacks against Israeli aggressor forces in October, killing and wounding approximately 230 Israeli aggressors. The guerrilla teams also captured one Israeli intelligence officer and one Israeli intelligence agent, shot down one Israeli helicopter, destroyed three heavy tanks, 22 half-track jeeps, and eight transport vehicles, and also destroyed three barracks and ammunition depots.

In October, Palestinian guerrilla teams frequently launched attacks and intensified their combat against the enemy. This powerfully struck at the evil plots of U.S. imperialism and its accomplices to "politically solve" the Middle East issue, greatly dampened the arrogance of the Israeli aggressors in their mad military provocations, and greatly boosted the courageous struggle of the Palestinian people and other Arab peoples to liberate the occupied lands.

    巴勒斯坦游击队十月份取得新胜利
    向以色列侵略军发动了一百四十次袭击，歼灭敌人八百多名
    据新华社大马士革电　据“法塔赫”（巴勒斯坦民族解放运动）和巴勒斯坦解放组织二日分别发表的十月份综合战报，巴勒斯坦游击队在这个月内在同以色列侵略军英勇作战中又取得新的巨大胜利。
    “法塔赫”的战报说，“暴风”突击队十月份在被占领的阿拉伯土地上，连续向以色列侵略者发动了一百一十次袭击，共打死打伤大约六百名以色列侵略军，破坏以色列五个观察哨和十个据点，其中包括在死海附近的一个以色列军官俱乐部，击毁二十辆坦克和扫雷车、八十八辆军车、十四门大炮，并缴获了五门各种口径的大炮。突击队还炸坏以色列一个国际机场的主楼以及六段铁路和桥梁、几个油槽和油管、两个大工厂。
    巴勒斯坦解放组织的战报说，它所属的游击队十月份对以色列侵略军发动三十次袭击，打死打伤大约二百三十名以色列侵略军。游击队还俘虏了一名以色列情报官和一名以色列情报特务，打落一架以色列直升飞机，击毁三辆重型坦克、二十二辆半履带吉普车和八辆运输车，还破坏了三座营房和弹药库。
    十月份，巴勒斯坦游击队频繁出击，加紧对敌作战，这有力地打击了美帝国主义及其帮凶紧张策划“政治解决”中东问题的罪恶阴谋，大灭了以色列侵略者疯狂进行军事挑衅的气焰，大大鼓舞了巴勒斯坦人民和其他阿拉伯人民为解放被占领的土地而进行的英勇斗争。
