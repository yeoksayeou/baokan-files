In the great situation where the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories, the Ministry of Coal Industry recently held a nationwide conference on coal mine tunneling and the conservation and substitution of pit props in the Fengfeng Mining Bureau of Hebei Province.

This conference called on the revolutionary masses of the coal industry and all revolutionary workers to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to seriously implement the various combat tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, to further raise the consciousness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, to grasp revolution and promote production, and to focus on tunneling and the conservation and substitution of pit props, these two important links in coal production, to welcome the new leap in national industrial and agricultural production, and to strive for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

This conference seriously analyzed the excellent situation on the coal industry front. So far, the vast majority of units under the direct jurisdiction of the Ministry of Coal Industry have established revolutionary committees. The mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has become more extensive and in-depth, various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, and the struggle, criticism, and transformation have entered a high tide. National coal production has presented a new situation of great leaps forward. The average daily output of coal in October for large coal mines directly under the Ministry of Coal Industry increased by 6.3% compared to September. The Jingxing Coal Mine in Hebei, the Shuangyashan Coal Mine in Heilongjiang, and the Fengfeng Coal Mine in Hebei completed their annual national coal production and tunneling plans 71 days, 48 days, and 40 days ahead of schedule, respectively, achieving a double leap in mining and tunneling. Many coal mines have already exceeded their 1966 production levels.

The 24 representatives from the revolutionary committees of provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, as well as workers, revolutionary cadres, and military representatives from various coal mines, repeatedly and seriously studied the series of latest instructions from the great leader Chairman Mao and the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee. They listened to the report by the PLA on creating excellent units and the report by an old worker on recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness. Through study, the representatives further understood the great significance of Chairman Mao's great policies of "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness" and "to be thrifty and make revolution." During the conference, the representatives wielded the heavy hammer of Mao Zedong Thought to concentrate on criticizing the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi's theory of "the extinction of class struggle," and criticized Liu Shaoqi and his agents on the coal industry front for promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist goods of "material incentives," "money-first," "expert management of mines," "emphasis on mining over tunneling," and "passive balance between mining and tunneling."

Through the revolutionary criticism and struggle, the representatives deeply understood that the glorious task of the broad revolutionary masses on the coal industry front is not only to mine coal but more importantly to uproot the black roots of revisionism and ensure that the enterprise develops forever in the direction of socialism.

Representatives from various places enthusiastically exchanged experiences in learning from the PLA and taking the road of political construction of mines; learning from the Fengfeng Coal Mine, which used Mao Zedong Thought as a guideline, promoted production with revolution, made comprehensive arrangements, correctly handled the relationship between mining and tunneling, achieved active balance, and gained the initiative in production, achieving double victories in revolution and production; and widely exchanged valuable experiences in the conservation and substitution of pit props. The representatives believed that the work of tunneling and the conservation and substitution of pit props, as long as they adhere to the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought, take the road of political construction of mines, give full play to the leading role of the working class, believe in and rely on the masses, stand on self-reliance, and further implement Chairman Mao's great instructions of "thrift in building the country" and "to be thrifty and make revolution," they will definitely be able to do a good job.

    认真落实十二中全会提出的各项战斗任务迎接工农业生产新跃进
    煤炭工业部召开全国煤矿掘进和坑木节约代用现场会议
    据新华社石家庄二十六日电　在无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大的决定性胜利的大好形势下，煤炭工业部最近在河北峰峰矿务局召开全国煤矿掘进和坑木节约代用现场会议。
    这次会议号召全国煤炭系统的无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，认真落实党的八届扩大的十二中全会提出的各项战斗任务，进一步提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，狠抓革命，猛促生产，切实抓紧掘进和坑木节约代用这两个煤炭生产中的重要环节，为迎接全国工农业生产的新跃进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而奋斗！
    这次会议认真分析了当前煤炭工业战线的大好形势。到目前为止，煤炭工业部直属大型煤矿，绝大多数单位已经成立了革命委员会。煤炭工业战线活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动更加深入广泛地展开，各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班如雨后春笋蓬勃发展，斗、批、改进入了高潮。全国煤炭生产呈现出大跃进的新局面。煤炭工业部直属大型煤矿十月份平均日产量比九月份提高百分之六点三。河北井陉煤矿、黑龙江双鸭山煤矿、河北峰峰煤矿，分别提前七十一天、四十八天和四十天完成全年国家原煤生产和掘进计划，实现了采掘双跃进。许多煤矿的原煤生产已经超过了一九六六年的生产水平。
    参加这次现场会的二十四个省、市、自治区革命委员会的代表和各煤矿的工人、革命干部、解放军代表，反复认真地学习了伟大领袖毛主席的一系列最新指示和党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报，听取了解放军关于创造四好连队的报告和老工人所作的忆苦思甜的报告。通过学习，代表们进一步认识到毛主席的“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”和“要节约闹革命”的伟大方针的伟大意义。会议期间，代表们奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，集中批判了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，批判了刘少奇及其在煤炭工业战线的代理人在掘进和坑木节约代用方面所推行的“物质刺激”、“金钱挂帅”、“专家治矿”、“重采轻掘”、“采掘消极平衡”等反革命修正主义黑货。通过革命大批判，代表们深刻认识到煤炭工业战线广大革命职工的光荣任务不仅是挖煤，更重要的是要挖掉修正主义的黑根，保证企业永远朝着社会主义的方向发展。
    各地代表热情交流了学习解放军、走政治建矿道路的经验；学习了峰峰煤矿以毛泽东思想为指针，以革命带动生产，统筹兼顾，全面安排，正确处理采掘关系，实现积极平衡，取得生产主动权，获得革命、生产双胜利的好经验；还广泛交流了坑木节约和代用方面的宝贵经验。代表们认为，掘进和坑木节约代用工作，只要坚持用毛泽东思想挂帅，走政治建矿的道路，充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，相信和依靠群众，立足于自力更生，进一步落实毛主席关于“勤俭建国”和“要节约闹革命”的伟大指示，就一定能够做好。
