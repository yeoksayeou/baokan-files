	March Forward with Great Leap Forward Following the Great Leader Chairman Mao!
	The Workers of Shenyang Study and Promote the Communiqué of the Twelfth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee
	Resolutely Implement the Combat Tasks Proposed by the Plenum and Launch a New High Tide of Struggle, Criticism, and Reform

	Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, November 6 — The workers of Shenyang, a major industrial base in China, have swiftly launched a mass movement to study, promote, and implement the communiqué of the Eighth Central Committee's enlarged Twelfth Plenary Session, pushing the struggle, criticism, and reform in factories and enterprises to a new high tide.

	The joyous news of the communiqué's publication reached Shenyang, and various factories and enterprises from the factory area to the dormitories, from the leadership organs to the grassroots teams, held celebration meetings, discussion meetings, and oath-taking rallies to implement the great combat tasks proposed by the plenary session. Various levels of revolutionary committees took the lead in studying, promoting, and implementing, leading the broad revolutionary workers to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and resolutely implement the various combat calls proposed by the plenary session. The members of the Revolutionary Committee of Shenyang Smelting Plant, together with the stationed PLA, formed more than twenty propaganda teams to go to the workshops to propagate the communiqué to the broad revolutionary workers and explain it in combination with the actual situation of the factory, helping the workers to deeply understand the spirit of the communiqué. The leading members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Sino-Czech Friendship Plant held a Mao Zedong Thought study class on the day after the communiqué was published. In the study class, they checked their work in the plant based on the combat tasks proposed by the plenary session, formulated implementation plans and measures. Under the leadership of the Revolutionary Committee members, revolutionary workers in various workshops also organized Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to widely propagate the communiqué of the plenary session inside and outside the plant.

	Many factories' workers, in the process of deeply studying the communiqué of the plenary session, reviewed the two-year-plus battle course of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, enthusiastically praising the great achievements of the great leader Chairman Mao. The workers also angrily criticized the counter-revolutionary crimes of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, pushing the revolutionary criticism to a new high tide. Under the leadership of the Revolutionary Committee, every workshop, every team, and every machine in Shenyang Bearing Factory became a battlefield for criticizing Liu Shaoqi. The workers said, the Eighth Central Committee's enlarged Twelfth Plenary Session unanimously passed the resolution to expel Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever and revoke all his Party and non-Party positions, which is truly heartening! We must respond to the call of the plenary session, continue to deeply carry out the revolutionary criticism, and eliminate the counter-revolutionary revisionist thoughts of Liu Shaoqi and other top handful of capitalist roaders within the Party.

	Revolutionary workers in various factories and enterprises also carried out activities to find gaps, catch up with the advanced, and follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment during the study of the communiqué. Some units that had done a good job in struggle, criticism, and reform in the past found some new shortcomings through finding gaps; some relatively backward units clarified the direction of struggle, criticism, and reform through studying the communiqué. The revolutionary workers of Shenyang Paper Mill, which had done a good job in struggle, criticism, and reform, carried out the activity of "studying the communiqué, finding gaps, raising questions, and making plans," and formulated measures to further improve struggle, criticism, and reform. After studying the communiqué, the revolutionary workers of Shenyang Third Machine Tool Plant further strengthened the work of revolutionary criticism and cleaning up the class ranks. In recent days, the plant has consecutively held more than twenty exposure and criticism meetings, fiercely exposing and criticizing the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents' counter-revolutionary crimes in the plant.

	Inspired by the communiqué, the workers of Shenyang have launched a new high tide of grabbing revolution and promoting production. Shenyang 615 Factory, 53 Factory, Small Tractor Factory, Rubber Factory No. 4, and a batch of factories have made new leaps in production after completing the October production plan ahead of schedule. The silver-plating problem of the products in the electromagnet wire workshop of Shenyang Cable Factory had long been unsolved under the control of bourgeois reactionary "authorities." The revolutionary workers of the silver-plating group, inspired by the communiqué, marched into the factory laboratory and fought for several days and nights, solving this "old difficult" problem and greatly improving production efficiency. Many workshops and teams in Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory checked and revised the revolutionary and production plans in combination with the study of the communiqué. The workers of Workshop 9, in order to complete the production plan ahead of schedule, used every possible means to quickly put a precision lead screw lathe that had been idle for nine years into production, manufacturing precision lead screws urgently needed by the state.

    紧跟伟大领袖毛主席奋勇前进！
    沈阳工人阶级认真学习宣传党的十二中全会公报
    坚决执行全会提出的战斗任务掀起斗批改新高潮
    新华社沈阳六日电　我国重工业基地沈阳市的工人阶级雷厉风行地掀起了学习、宣传、执行党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的群众运动，把工厂企业的斗、批、改推向一个新的高潮。
    全会公报发表的喜讯传到沈阳后，全市各工厂企业从厂区到宿舍，从领导机关到基层班组，纷纷召开了欢呼公报发表的庆祝会、座谈会和落实全会提出的伟大战斗任务的誓师大会。各级革命委员会学习在先，宣传在先，落实在先，率领广大革命职工紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决贯彻执行全会提出的各项战斗号召。沈阳冶炼厂革委会成员和驻厂解放军一起组成了二十多个宣讲小组，分别下车间向广大革命职工宣讲公报，并且结合工厂实际进行讲解，帮助职工深刻领会公报的精神。中捷人民友谊厂革委会领导成员在公报发表的第二天，就举办了毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里他们根据全会提出的战斗任务，对照检查了本厂过去的工作，制订了落实的规划和措施。在革委会成员的带动下，各车间革命职工也组织了毛泽东思想宣传队，在厂内厂外广泛宣传全会公报。
    许多工厂的工人在深入学习全会公报的过程中，回顾了两年多来无产阶级文化大革命的战斗历程，热情歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的丰功伟绩。工人们还满腔愤怒地深入批判了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命罪行，把革命大批判推向了一个新高潮。沈阳市轴承厂在革委会领导下，每一个车间，每一个班组，每一个机台，都成了批判刘少奇的战场。工人们说，党的八届扩大的十二中全会一致通过决议，把刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外的一切职务，真是大快人心！我们一定响应全会提出的号召，继续深入展开革命大批判，肃清刘少奇等党内最大的一小撮走资派的反革命修正主义的思想。
    各工厂企业革命职工还在学习公报的过程中，开展了找差距，追先进，紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的活动。过去一些斗、批、改搞得较好的单位，通过找差距又找出了一些新的不足；一些比较后进的单位，通过学习公报进一步明确了斗、批、改的方向。斗、批、改搞得比较好的沈阳市人民造纸厂革命职工开展了“学公报，找差距，提问题，作规划”的活动，订出了进一步搞好斗、批、改的措施。沈阳第三机床厂革命职工学习公报后，进一步加强了革命大批判和清理阶级队伍的工作。几天来，这个厂连续召开了二十多次揭发批判会，狠揭猛批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其在厂内代理人的反革命滔天罪行。
    沈阳市工人阶级在公报的鼓舞下，掀起了抓革命、促生产的新高潮。沈阳六一五厂、五三工厂、小型拖拉机厂、橡胶四厂等一批工厂在提前完成十月份生产计划的基础上，生产又有新的飞跃。沈阳电缆厂电磁线车间的产品镀银问题，过去在资产阶级反动技术“权威”把持下长期不得解决。镀银小组的革命工人在公报的鼓舞下，开进厂试验室，奋战几昼夜，解决了这个“老大难”问题，大大提高了生产效率。沈阳重型机器厂许多车间、班组，结合学习公报检查修订了革命和生产规划。九车间的工人，为了提前完成生产计划，千方百计使一台搁置了九年的精密丝杠车床迅速投入了生产，制造出国家急需的精密丝杠。
