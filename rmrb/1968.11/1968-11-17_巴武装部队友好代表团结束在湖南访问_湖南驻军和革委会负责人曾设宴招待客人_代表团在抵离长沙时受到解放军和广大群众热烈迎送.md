Upon their arrival and departure from Changsha, the delegation was warmly welcomed and seen off by over a thousand People's Liberation Army personnel, members of the Hunan Provincial and Changsha Municipal Revolutionary Committees, as well as soldiers and Red Guards.

Yesterday, under the accompaniment of Vice Minister Xiao Jingguang, the Pakistani military friendship delegation visited Shaoshan, the hometown of our great leader Chairman Mao. Workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, PLA personnel stationed in Shaoshan, and Red Guards from Shaoshan enthusiastically welcomed the Pakistani guests with drums and gongs, holding high the portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao and President Ayub Khan of Pakistan. The Pakistani guests enthusiastically visited the former residence of our great leader Chairman Mao and the exhibition hall of Mao's former residence, and took a group photo in front of Mao's former residence.

General Ayyub Khan said, "In Beijing, we had the honor of being received by your great leader Chairman Mao Zedong. Today, we are fortunate to visit this great village—Chairman Mao's hometown, Shaoshan. This is a very inspiring event. We will forever remember the enthusiastic and heartfelt welcome from the people of Shaoshan."

That evening, the leaders of the Hunan Military Region and the Hunan Provincial Revolutionary Committee hosted a banquet in honor of the Pakistani guests.
