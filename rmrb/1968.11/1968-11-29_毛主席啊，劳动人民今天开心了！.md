Chairman Mao, the laboring people are happy today!

Comrades Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu's suggestion has reached the forests of Fujian. The broad masses of workers in the forest area are shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years of long life to Chairman Mao!" Everyone unanimously says, "Chairman Mao, the laboring people are happy today!"

Primary schools in rural areas are part of the production brigade. Public primary schools should be handed over to the production brigade to manage. Primary school teachers should be members of the brigade, and their work points should be evaluated and recorded by the brigade. Only in this way can Chairman Mao's instruction on "poor and lower-middle peasants managing the schools" be truly implemented, and it will also be beneficial for the reform of intellectuals.

This suggestion represents the interests of the broad masses of laboring people and is a major issue concerning the direction of our educational cause.

In the old society, we poor people had no right to education at all. After liberation, Liu Shaoqi, this great traitor, great spy, and great saboteur, and his accomplice Lu Dingyi, under the pretext of "standardization," did not allow the working people to manage the schools. The school gates were basically open to the children of the bourgeoisie, and how many children of workers and peasants were excluded from the school gates!

"Scythes cut through the old world, axes open up a new era." Now, with this revolutionary initiative to "hand over all public primary schools to the production brigade to manage," the spirit of workers, peasants, and soldiers has been greatly boosted, and the arrogance of the "nobles" has been greatly suppressed.

Comrades! The wheels of the new educational system are turning, but we must always remember Chairman Mao's great teaching: "Never forget class struggle." We must unswervingly take control of the schools and manage them well.

### 毛主席啊，劳动人民今天开心了！

    毛主席啊，劳动人民今天开心了！
    侯振民、王庆余两位教师的建议传到了福建林区，林区的广大工人千遍万遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”大家异口同声地说：“毛主席啊，劳动人民今天开心了！”
    农村的小学是属于大队的一部分，公办小学应该下放到大队来办。小学教师应该是大队的一个成员，他们应该在队里评工记分。这样才能真正落实毛主席关于“贫下中农管理学校”的指示，也才有利于对知识分子的改造。
    这个建议代表了广大劳动人民的利益，是关系到我们的教育事业朝着哪个方向走的大问题。
    我们穷人在旧社会根本没有读书的权利。解放了，刘少奇这个大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼和他的同伙陆定一，却又打着“正规化”的幌子，不让工农群众管理学校，学校大门基本上是向资产阶级子女开的，多少的工农子女都被排斥在学校大门以外。
    “镰刀刈断旧乾坤，斧头劈开新天地。”现在有了这个“所有公办小学下放到大队来办”的革命倡议，大长了工农兵的志气，大灭了“高贵者”的威风。
    同志们！新的教育制度的车轮转动了，但我们一定要牢记毛主席的伟大教导：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”。我们要坚定不移地把学校管起来，并且把它管好。
