My daughter Wu Xiaoming volunteered to settle down in Inner Mongolia and become a herdsman last year. In the more than half a year since then, under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought and with the Party's care and the help of poor herdsmen, she has worked hard to transform her thinking and grown rapidly.

In the past, because I did not study Chairman Mao's works well, the idea of "learning to become an official" from the exploiting classes still lingered in my mind. I thought Xiaoming had literary talent, so I tried every means to cultivate her interest in literature, sending her to a prestigious school far from home. I also found people to help her with her studies, preparing her for admission to a prestigious university. Usually, I was concerned only with her grades, telling her to "ignore worldly affairs and focus on studying the classics." I hoped she would become a "scholar" and a "successful person." I thought this was the right way to educate a child! Now I realize that I was poisoned by Liu Shaoqi's "study to become an official" theory.

When Xiaoming decided to go to Inner Mongolia last year, I couldn't understand it, thinking it was a waste of her talents and that she would have no future. However, after she talked to me several times, I began to seriously consider the issue. I studied the "Three Articles" with this question in mind. Dr. Norman Bethune had no personal motives; he regarded the liberation of the Chinese people as his own cause. Zhang Zide's life was dedicated to wherever he was needed. Comparing myself to them, I felt ashamed that I couldn't understand my child going to the frontier for the country, realizing that this was disloyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao.

What constitutes "success" differs among classes. All exploiting classes consider "promotion and wealth" as success. Liu Shaoqi's "study to become an official" theory is a poison that corrupts the youth. The proletariat, however, believes that unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, resolute adherence to Chairman Mao's words, and following the revolutionary and labor paths he pointed out, uniting with the working-class masses, and becoming reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause is the greatest success.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Xiaoming studied Chairman Mao's works diligently, significantly raising her class consciousness. She responded to Chairman Mao's call to "unite with the workers and peasants" and actively volunteered to settle down in Inner Mongolia. In just over half a year, she transformed from a middle school student into a herdsman on the grasslands and an active member of the study of Chairman Mao's works in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. This fact dealt a powerful blow to Liu Shaoqi's "study to become an official" theory.

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our party and state cadres are ordinary workers, not lords who ride on the heads of the people." Cultivating ordinary workers who serve the people wholeheartedly, rather than cultivating nobles and lords who ride on the heads of the people, is the fundamental difference between Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line and Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line.

Xiaoming's growth deepened my understanding of Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line. I firmly support her in taking the path of uniting with the workers and peasants and doing revolution on the frontier for life!

### 用实际行动粉碎“读书做官”论

    用实际行动粉碎“读书做官”论
    志愿到内蒙古安家落户知识青年家长　张书琴
    我的女儿吴小明是去年志愿到内蒙古草原插队当牧民的。在半年多的时间里，她在毛泽东思想阳光哺育下，在党的关怀和贫苦牧民的帮助下，努力改造自己的思想，迅速地成长起来。
    过去由于我没有很好地学习毛主席著作，所以“学而优则仕”一套剥削阶级意识在我脑子里还未根除。我认为小明有文学“天才”，我想方设法培养她钻研文学的兴趣，让她到离家很远的“名牌”学校去上学。我还找人帮她补习功课，为将来入“名牌”大学作准备。平时我关心的也是分、分，让她“两耳不闻窗外事，一心专读圣贤书”。我希望她成为“有学问的人”，“有出息的人”。我认为这才是教子有方呢！现在我才明白，这是中了刘少奇“读书做官”论的毒。
    当去年小明下决心报名去内蒙古草原安家落户的时候，我是想不通的，认为是“屈才”，没有出息。但是她再三和我谈，促使我认真地考虑这个问题。我带着这个思想问题学习了“老三篇”。白求恩同志毫无利己的动机，把中国人民的解放事业当作他自己的事业。张思德同志的一生，哪里需要，他就到哪里。我对照自己，想到自己对孩子到祖国边疆去却想不通，觉得很惭愧，这是对伟大领袖毛主席的不忠。
    什么叫“出息”，不同的阶级有不同的理解。一切剥削阶级都把“升官发财”算作有出息。刘少奇的“读书做官”论，是腐蚀青年的毒药。无产阶级则认为无限忠于毛主席，坚决听毛主席的话，走毛主席指出的革命化、劳动化的道路，同工农群众相结合，成为无产阶级革命事业可靠的接班人，这才是最大的出息。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，由于小明努力学习毛主席著作，阶级觉悟有了很大的提高。她响应毛主席“同工农群众结合”的伟大号召，积极报名去内蒙古草原安家落户。在短短的半年多时间里，她由一个中学生变成了一个草原上的牧民，变成了一个内蒙古自治区学习毛主席著作的积极分子。这一事实，给了刘少奇“读书做官”论有力的回击。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷。”培养全心全意为人民服务的普通劳动者，而不是培养骑在人民头上的贵族、老爷，这就是毛主席的无产阶级教育路线同刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线的根本区别。
    小明成长的事实，使我加深了对毛主席的无产阶级教育路线的理解。我坚决支持她走同工农群众相结合的道路，在祖国的边疆干一辈子革命！
