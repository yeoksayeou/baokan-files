I am a primary school teacher in the Dashi Lake Production Brigade of the Dadao Production Team, He Lan People's Commune, Liaoyang City. Dashi Lake Mountain is one of the highest peaks in the eastern mountains of Liaoyang. At the top of Dashi Lake Mountain, there is a small basin where twelve households live. This is the Dashi Lake Production Brigade. I have settled down in this brigade for more than five years. The school has been changed from a public-run to a collectively-run and publicly-assisted, and then to a completely collectively-run school. The teachers have been changed from a salary system to a work-point system, all within four years. Under the direct education of the poor and lower-middle peasants, I have been both a teacher and a farmer. The poor and lower-middle peasants regard me as their confidant. From my personal experience, I feel that moving the rural primary schools to the production brigades is the best way for teachers to receive re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants and to realize the revolutionization of their thoughts.

I came to Dashi Lake Primary School to teach in 1963. Not long after I went up the mountain, the poor and lower-middle peasants cared about my work and life, and let me move my family to Dashi Lake. This incident caused a fierce struggle in my mind. I thought, moving up the mountain would make me completely a farmer, wouldn't it? I am still a publicly-run teacher! But then I thought, the poor and lower-middle peasants raised me with their sweat, Chairman Mao sent me to school, but now I don't want to serve the poor and lower-middle peasants, which is too ungrateful to Chairman Mao. So, my wife and I moved our family to Dashi Lake Mountain. When we moved, the brigade leader helped me carry a large jar from the foot of the mountain to the top. He said seriously, "Helping you carry the jar up is what we poor and lower-middle peasants should do, but if you want to carry it down, we poor and lower-middle peasants can't help with that." At that time, I was very moved and said, "Chairman Mao has shown me the direction, the poor and lower-middle peasants have led me on the right path, and I will walk this path for life."

After coming to Dashi Lake, the poor and lower-middle peasants, in order to further promote the revolutionization of teachers' thoughts, wanted to change the teachers' salary system to a work-point system. The poor and lower-middle peasants said, "Teachers live in the countryside and eat in the countryside, why should they be different from the poor and lower-middle peasants?" The poor and lower-middle peasants' opinions were very profound, but at that time, I couldn't understand it. I thought, teachers are for teaching, and teaching also earns work points, what's the meaning of that? But then I thought, what is meaningful? Chairman Mao said, "Our army is completely for the liberation of the people, and is thoroughly for the interests of the people." The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dashi Lake are farming for the revolution with all their hearts. In winter, when the snow blocks the roads, they use their iron shoulders to rush to carry grain down the mountain to support the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. They said, "We must listen to Chairman Mao's words, for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, the people of Dashi Lake are willing to use their backs as carriage boards!" The poor and lower-middle peasants' ideological level is so high! This reflects the gap between my thoughts and those of the poor and lower-middle peasants! The poor and lower-middle peasants have only Chairman Mao and the revolution in their hearts, and they have never thought about making big money or gaining big benefits, but I always worry about gains and losses, only thinking about this little bit in front of my nose! I must first become a person who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao like the poor and lower-middle peasants, and then I can use Mao Zedong Thought to educate the successors of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Thinking of this, I firmly requested to be given work points like the community members.

For the past four years, I have been evaluated and given work points like the ordinary members of Dashi Lake. My relationship with the poor and lower-middle peasants has become even closer. I have also taken on multiple tasks such as the brigade's accountant, barber, and health worker. After the Cultural Revolution began, the brigade set up a night school to study Chairman Mao's works, and the community members elected me to be their tutor. This is the poor and lower-middle peasants' greatest trust in me. During the criticism of the great traitor Liu Shaoqi's implementation of the counter-revolutionary crimes of "three selfs and one package" and "four freedoms," I was further educated and tempered. I was honored to join the great Communist Party of China, and the poor and lower-middle peasants elected me as a "five-good community member." Recently, I was also rated as an active member in the study and application of Chairman Mao's works.

Under the care of the poor and lower-middle peasants, my wife also participated in the collective production labor of the brigade. The food and other daily necessities for our family of six are provided by the brigade according to the community members' standard, and our lives are arranged very well. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants have given me honors and treatment that far exceed my achievements. I will always listen to Chairman Mao's words, serve the poor and lower-middle peasants for life, and carry out the proletarian educational revolution to the end. I hope that all rural teachers will thoroughly take the road of integrating with the poor and lower-middle peasants, be both farmers and teachers, and become revolutionary intellectuals welcomed by the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    贫下中农给我的待遇远远超过我所做的成绩
    我是辽阳市河栏人民公社大东大队大石湖生产队的小学教师。
    大石湖山是辽阳东部群山中最高峰之一。在大石湖山的山顶上，有一块小盆地，住着十二户人家，这就是大石湖生产队。我到这个生产队安家落户已经五年多了。学校由公办改为民办公助，由民办公助改为完全民办，教师由工资制改为工分制，也有四年了。在贫下中农直接教育下，我既当教师又当农民，贫下中农把我看成是他们的知心人。我从自己的亲身经历感到：农村小学下放到生产大队办，这是教师接受贫下中农再教育，实现教师思想革命化的最好途径。
    我是一九六三年来到大石湖小学当教师的。上山不久，贫下中农关心我的工作和生活，就让我把家搬到大石湖来。这件事引起了我思想上的激烈斗争。我想，搬上山去，不是完全成了农民了吗？我现在还是个公办教师哩！可是又一想，贫下中农用汗水把我养大，毛主席让我上学念书，现在我却不想为贫下中农服务，太对不起毛主席了。于是我和爱人一起把家搬到大石湖山上。搬家时，生产队长帮我把一口大缸从山下抬到山上，他语重心长地说：“帮你往上抬缸，这是咱贫下中农应该做的，可是要往山下抬，咱贫下中农可不能帮这个忙。”当时我非常激动地说：毛主席给我指明了方向，贫下中农领我走了正路，这个路我要走一辈子。
    到大石湖后，贫下中农为了进一步促进教师的思想革命化，想把教师的工资制改成工分制。贫下中农说：“教师住在农村，吃在农村，为什么非要和贫下中农两样？”贫下中农提出的意见是非常深刻的，但当时我的思想却想不通。我想，教师就是教书的，教书也挣工分，这还有什么意思？但我又反过来想，什么是有意思呢？毛主席他老人家说：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”大石湖的贫下中农一心为革命种田，冬天大雪封路，他们用自己的铁肩膀，争先恐后地往山下运粮食，支援中国革命和世界革命。他们说：“咱们要听毛主席的话，为了中国革命和世界革命，咱大石湖人愿把脊背当车铺板！”贫下中农的思想境界是多高啊！这反映了我和贫下中农的思想差距有多么远！贫下中农心中只有毛主席，只有革命，从来没有想到挣大钱，得大利，可我总是患得患失，只想到自己鼻尖下面这么一丁点儿！我要首先做一个贫下中农那样无限忠于毛主席的人，才能用毛泽东思想教育贫下中农的后代。想到这里，我就坚决要求给我和社员一样记工分。
    四年来我和大石湖的普通社员一样评工记分，我和贫下中农的关系更加接近了。我先后还担任了生产队的会计、理发员、卫生员等多项工作。文化大革命开始以后，队里办了夜校，大学毛主席著作，社员们推选我给他们作辅导，这是贫下中农对我最大的信任。在和贫下中农一起批判大叛徒刘少奇推行“三自一包”、“四大自由”的反革命罪行时，我进一步得到了教育和锻炼。我光荣地参加了伟大的中国共产党，贫下中农推选我为“五好社员”。最近我还被评为活学活用毛主席著作的积极分子。
    在贫下中农的关怀下，我爱人也参加了生产队的集体生产劳动。我们全家六口人的口粮和其他副食等用品，生产队按社员标准供给，生活安排得十分妥贴。广大贫下中农给我的荣誉和待遇，远远超过了我所做的成绩。我要永远听毛主席的话，一辈子为贫下中农服务，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底。我希望一切农村的教师都彻底走与贫下中农相结合的道路，既当农民又当教师，做一个受工农兵欢迎的革命的知识分子。
