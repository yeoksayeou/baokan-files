The PLA warmly celebrates the success of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Twelfth Enlarged Meeting of the Eighth Central Committee. The officers and soldiers unanimously declare: We firmly support the resolutions and the great battle call issued by the plenary session, strive to complete all combat tasks, and heighten our vigilance. If the enemy dares to impose war on us, we will definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions to annihilate them completely.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 2nd, the vast number of officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) across the army, navy, and air force, who are infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, are filled with the joy of victory and warmly celebrate the success of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Twelfth Enlarged Meeting of the Eighth Central Committee. They also warmly celebrate the publication of the communiqué of this historic meeting. The soldiers of the three services, on this joyous day, unanimously solemnly declare that they firmly support the resolutions of the plenary session and the great battle call issued by the plenary session. They will strive to complete all combat tasks, welcome the convening of the Ninth Party Congress, and are determined to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher. Under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, they will closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao and march forward bravely!

Last night, as soon as the communiqué of the Eighth Twelfth Plenary Session was issued, the entire army was filled with excitement. The leadership organs of the various general departments of the People's Liberation Army, the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, the National Defense Industry Office, the various military branches, and the Beijing Military Region, as well as the representatives of the units participating in the study classes on Mao Zedong Thought and various meetings in the capital, held grand celebrations late into the night. At dawn today, they held a massive celebratory parade. Many responsible comrades of various units who have followed Chairman Mao in countless battles over the decades, along with old Red Army soldiers and the broad masses of officers and soldiers, repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" They carried giant portraits of Chairman Mao and marched towards Tiananmen Square and Zhongnanhai to express their loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. The broad masses of officers and soldiers joyfully said: The communiqué is a great victory report. It proclaims to the people of the world that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has achieved great and decisive victories; the communiqué is a mobilization order. It solemnly calls on the people and soldiers of the entire country to follow the great leader Chairman Mao and advance to victory, seizing the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution; the communiqué is a verdict. It pronounces the complete downfall of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices.

The leadership organs and subordinate units of the Shenyang, Nanjing, Jinan, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Kunming, Chengdu, Lanzhou, Xinjiang, and Tibet military regions have held celebratory meetings and parades since last night. The party committees of various units have issued notices to immediately launch a wave of studying, propagating, executing, and defending the communiqué of the plenary session. Many units and officers and soldiers participating in the Fourth Good Unit Representative Conference and the Exchange Conference on the Experience of the Fourth Good Unit Movement in the Air Force, Beijing, Wuhan, Kunming, Jinan, and Lanzhou, while celebrating the publication of the communiqué, also expressed their revolutionary indignation against the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan. The broad masses of officers and soldiers, filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, said: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has thoroughly smashed the bourgeois headquarters represented by the number one capitalist-roader in the party, Liu Shaoqi, who attempted to usurp the party, the government, and the military. It has crushed the "February Countercurrent" and the evil wind trying to reverse the "February Countercurrent." This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. It is also the greatest happiness for the hundreds of millions of people and soldiers of the country.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is completely necessary and very timely for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist restoration, and building socialism." The broad masses of officers and soldiers, immersed in unprecedented excitement, deeply feel from their personal experiences in this great battle that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has brought immense happiness to hundreds of millions of people. Chairman Mao's great theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat has extremely profound significance.

The good news spread across the country's thousands of miles of coastal defenses and tens of thousands of miles of borders. The coastal defense and border defense troops on duty day and night immediately became excited. The officers and soldiers of the army, navy, and air force on the front lines of Fujian and the coastal outposts of Zhejiang were filled with fighting spirit and declared that they would firmly respond to the great call of the plenary session, better grasp the revolution, promote preparedness, defend the country's coastal defenses, and train their skills to kill the enemy. They must liberate the sacred territory of Taiwan! The officers and soldiers of the certain anti-aircraft artillery company stationed day and night along the coast of the Beibu Gulf and the certain coastal defense unit's "home-island defense company" firmly declared in a meeting that they would definitely do a better job of supporting the army and loving the people, heighten their revolutionary vigilance, and if the U.S. imperialists dare to impose war on us, we will definitely follow the instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao to annihilate them completely.
