At dawn, the morning sun was ablaze. In the fields of the Xizhong Street Production Brigade, members of the Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team from Shanghai Fudan University, soldiers and officers from a certain unit of the Air Force, poor and lower-middle peasants, and Red Guards all enthusiastically responded to the call from the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee's communiqué to the entire Party and the people of the nation to continue to deepen the revolutionary criticism and denunciation. They were holding a denunciation and criticism meeting in the fields to expose and condemn the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi.

Comrade Xin Zhihai from the 7029 Factory of the Propaganda Team first angrily denounced the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes of suppressing the revolutionary rebels. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he followed Chairman Mao's teachings on "it is reasonable to rebel against the reactionaries" and was the first to open fire on the old Party committee in the factory. However, the scoundrel Liu Shaoqi stubbornly pushed the bourgeois reactionary line, brutally suppressing the proletarian revolutionaries. Liu Shaoqi's agents in the factory, the capitalist-roaders, hated Xin Zhihai to the core, fabricating various charges and putting seven big hats on him, including "counter-revolutionary" and "anti-Party element." They besieged him for thirteen hours in front of the old municipal committee. In those days of white terror, it was Chairman Mao's teachings that inspired him to fight resolutely against the bourgeois headquarters represented by Liu Shaoqi; it was the great decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally drafted by our great leader Chairman Mao that liberated him. The revolution made him realize that Beijing was close, and rebelling made him feel even closer to Chairman Mao. At the field denunciation and criticism meeting, Xin Zhihai said excitedly, "Studying the communiqué makes me feel very close to Chairman Mao's teachings and the 'Sixteen Points.' It is the great Mao Zedong Thought and the 'Sixteen Points' that armed the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses, thoroughly exposing and smashing the bourgeois reactionary line of this traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi who knelt and surrendered to the enemy, betraying the interests of the working class." At this point, he could not control his immense excitement and repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!"

As the slogan faded, soldier Li Lianzhong, who was sitting closely with the Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, stood up from the crowd and angrily said, "For decades, Liu Shaoqi has used all kinds of counter-revolutionary tricks, disguising himself as an 'old Party member,' 'old revolutionary,' and 'leader of the workers.' However, history is merciless. Chairman Mao issued the great revolutionary document 'Bombard the Headquarters,' exposing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary face. Under the relentless pursuit and attack of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people, this traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader who had been hiding in the Party for over forty years was finally exposed. Li Lianzhong then exposed Liu Shaoqi's numerous crimes of attempting to restore capitalism, the more he exposed, the more hatred he felt, the more he exposed, the more the masses were enraged, and the slogans of 'Down with Liu Shaoqi' in the fields grew louder and louder.

At the denunciation and criticism meeting, the crowd was enthusiastic, and the fighting spirit was high. Everyone denounced Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes, and each person was filled with indignation. Old poor peasant Jin Dejun and militia platoon leader Zhao Linying criticized Liu Shaoqi's advocacy of the theory of the extinction of class struggle with the reality of class struggle in the production brigade. Everyone said that they must remember Chairman Mao's teachings of "never forget class struggle" and thoroughly denounce Liu Shaoqi's theory of the extinction of class struggle.

In the revolutionary criticism and denunciation in the fields, the Red Guards fiercely criticized Liu Shaoqi's revisionist educational line, enthusiastically shouting, "Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line! Long live the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" They also expressed their determination in front of the radiant portrait of Chairman Mao: to always listen to Chairman Mao's words, consciously accept the re-education of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and firmly walk the bright path of uniting with workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The soldiers' anger reached the heavens. The harvesting fields turned into a battlefield for denouncing and exposing Liu Shaoqi. As soon as the field criticism meeting ended, the workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, Air Force soldiers, and Red Guards, with the joy of the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the revolutionary spirit, eagerly returned to the harvesting battle.

    把“阶级斗争熄灭论”彻底批臭
    清晨，朝霞似火。在西中街生产队的田野里，战斗在三秋第一线的驻上海复旦大学工人毛泽东思想宣传队、空军某部的指战员、贫下中农和红卫兵小将热烈响应党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报对全党和全国人民发出的继续深入展开革命大批判的伟大号召，正在田头对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇展开大揭发、大声讨。
    宣传队中七○二九厂的工人辛志海首先对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇镇压革命造反派的滔天罪行进行了愤怒声讨。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他遵照毛主席关于“对反动派造反有理”的教导，在厂里首先向旧党委开了炮。可是刘少奇这个大坏蛋，顽固推行资产阶级反动路线，对无产阶级革命派进行了残酷镇压。刘少奇的代理人厂里走资派对辛志海恨之入骨，捏造种种罪名，给他扣上“反革命”、“反党分子”等七顶大帽子，在旧市委门前围攻他达十三小时之久。在那白色恐怖的日子里，是毛主席的教导鼓舞着他，向以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级司令部进行着坚决斗争；是我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的《关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》，使他得到了解放。革命方知北京近，造反更觉毛主席亲。在田头声讨批判会上，辛志海激动地说：“学习了公报，使我无比亲切地想起了毛主席的教导和‘十六条’。是伟大的毛泽东思想和‘十六条’，武装了亿万革命群众，彻底揭露和粉碎了这个屈膝投敌的大叛徒、大内奸、出卖工人阶级利益的大工贼刘少奇的资产阶级反动路线。”说到这里，他抑制不住心头的无比激动，不断地高呼：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    口号声刚落，和工人毛泽东思想宣传队紧紧坐在一起的战士李连仲从人群中站了起来，愤怒地说：“刘少奇几十年来，耍尽了反革命的两面手法，给自己披上了‘老党员’‘老革命’‘工人领袖’的外衣，乔装打扮。但是，历史是无情的。毛主席发表了《炮打司令部》的伟大的革命文献，戳穿了刘少奇的反革命面目。在浩浩荡荡的亿万革命人民穷追猛打下，终于把这个埋藏在党内四十多年的叛徒、内奸、工贼揪出来了。接着，李连仲痛揭了刘少奇一桩桩妄想复辟资本主义的滔天罪行，越揭越仇恨，越揭群众越气愤，田头上“打倒刘少奇”的口号声一浪高过一浪。
    声讨批判会上，群情振奋，斗志高昂，人人痛揭刘少奇的滔天罪行，个个义愤填膺。老贫农金德俊、民兵连指导员赵林英以生产队阶级斗争的现实，狠批了刘少奇鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭论”。大家说，我们一定要牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，把刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”彻底批臭。
    在田头的革命大批判中，红卫兵小将狠批了刘少奇推行的修正主义教育路线，热情高呼：“毛主席的革命路线胜利万岁！”“无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利万岁！”他们还在光芒四射的毛主席像前表示决心：永远听毛主席的话，自觉地接受工农兵的再教育，坚定地走和工农兵结合的光明大道。
    天兵怒气冲霄汉。收割的田头变成了对刘少奇控诉揭发的大声讨的战场。田头批判会一结束，工人、贫下中农、空军战士和红卫兵小将，带着无产阶级文化大革命胜利的喜悦和革命的豪情壮志，又紧张地投入了收割的战斗。
