Jiangsu's revolutionary committees at all levels have swiftly mobilized the masses to study and implement the various combat tasks proposed in the report of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, comparing the report with their work, checking their progress, and promoting the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

A report from Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, November 12: Jiangsu Province's revolutionary committees at all levels have taken the fastest speed and the most effective measures to mobilize the broad revolutionary masses to launch a wave of studying and propagating the report of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and implementing the various combat tasks proposed in the report, pushing the struggle, criticism, and transformation throughout the province to be broadly and deeply carried out.

After the report of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee was issued, the members of the revolutionary committees at all levels in Jiangsu Province conducted repeated studies and deeply realized that the report is a document of great historical significance, a revolutionary document shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, a beacon guiding the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and a spiritual atomic bomb inspiring the revolutionary masses to march forward bravely. Therefore, they must take various effective measures to carry out extensive and in-depth studies and propaganda, making the report known to every household and deeply rooted in people's hearts. To this end, the provincial revolutionary committee, after studying the report, issued a resolution on seriously studying, vigorously propagating, and resolutely implementing the report of the plenary session. Many local revolutionary committees quickly organized training classes on Mao Zedong Thought for the members of the revolutionary committees and the leaders of the grassroots revolutionary committees, seriously discussing and implementing the various combat tasks proposed in the report. Some revolutionary committees also organized training classes through the method of "study, discuss, and compare," studying the report word by word and sentence by sentence, understanding its spirit clause by clause, discussing the great historical significance of the report, praising the great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, extolling the unparalleled power of Mao Zedong Thought, and comparing the report with their own work and thoughts to identify gaps and clarify the direction of effort.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To turn the Party's line into the masses' line, we must make long-term, unyielding, arduous, and patient efforts without fear of trouble." The revolutionary committees at all levels follow Chairman Mao's teaching. While seriously studying and deeply understanding the essence of the report, they swiftly launched a series of mass propaganda activities. The revolutionary committee of Huaiyin County, after listening to the broadcast on the evening of November 1, quickly transmitted the spirit of the report to every production team and household through "red communication lines" within a few hours. The members of the revolutionary committees of Wuxi, Suzhou, and Liuhe Special Districts, after studying the report, immediately went deep into factories, mines, enterprises, and communes to study and propagate the report with the workers and peasants. Some county and city revolutionary committees and staff members brought the report to the fields, courtyards, and households of the production teams, and to the remote coastal fishing villages, studying and discussing with the community members.

Many revolutionary committees, while vigorously promoting the study and propaganda of the report, took various effective measures to ensure implementation. They started by checking the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, comparing the various combat tasks proposed in the report, identifying gaps, solving problems, and taking measures. They swiftly and resolutely addressed weak links, promoting the victory of the revolutionary criticism and the struggle, criticism, and transformation. Sanhe Commune in Hongze County is a place where the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi personally poisoned. After studying the report, the commune's revolutionary committee led the masses to launch a wave of fierce criticism of Liu Shaoqi's crimes throughout the commune, further mobilizing the revolutionary and productive enthusiasm of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants. By November 6, they had completed the autumn harvest. The revolutionary committee of Yan'an District in Suzhou City organized a training class for cadres on Mao Zedong Thought, focusing on implementing the call of the plenary session, fiercely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's revisionist line on power building and cadre issues, and promoting the smooth progress of the streamlining of the organs and the work of sending cadres down to the grassroots. The revolutionary committee of Nanzha People's Commune and the leadership group of Baizhuang Production Brigade in Huai'an County, through organizing training classes, comparing the report, checking work, and fully mobilizing the masses, thoroughly exposed hidden class enemies, achieving new results in the work of purifying the class ranks and revolutionary criticism.

　　江苏各级革委会深入发动群众学习和落实全会公报提出的各项战斗任务
　　对照公报　检查工作　推动斗批改
    新华社南京十二日电　江苏省各级革委会以最快的速度和最有效的措施，发动广大革命群众掀起了学习和宣传党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报和落实公报提出的各项战斗任务的热潮，推动全省斗、批、改广泛深入展开。
    党的八届十二中全会公报发表后，江苏省各级革委会成员进行了反复学习，深刻认识到，全会公报是具有伟大历史意义的重要文献，是闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的革命文献，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的指路明灯，是鼓舞革命群众奋勇前进的精神原子弹，因此必须采取各种有效措施，展开广泛深入的学习和宣传，做到家喻户晓，深入人心。为此，省革委会在学习公报后，作出了关于认真学习、大力宣传、坚决执行全会公报的决议。各地许多革委会，也迅速举办了有革委会成员和基层革委会群众组织负责人参加的毛泽东思想学习班，认真讨论和落实公报提出的各项战斗任务。有些革委会还通过举办学习班，采取一学二议三对照的方法，逐字逐句地学习，逐条逐段地领会公报精神，大议公报的伟大历史意义，大赞无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，大颂毛泽东思想的无比威力，并对照公报检查本单位、本地区和自己思想上、工作上的差距，明确努力方向。
    毛主席教导说：“把党的方针变为群众的方针，还须要我们长期坚持的、百折不挠的、艰苦卓绝的、耐心而不怕麻烦的努力。”各级革委会遵循毛主席的这一教导，在认真学习、深刻领会公报精神实质的同时，迅速展开了一系列的群众性的宣传活动。淮阴县革委会在十一月一日晚收听广播后，通过“红色线路”通讯员，在几个小时内就把公报精神传达到各生产队和社员家里。无锡、苏州、六合专区革委会成员在革委会学习后，立即深入厂矿企业、公社，同工农群众一道学习和宣传公报。有些县市革委会委员和工作人员，带着公报深入到生产队的田头、场头和社员家里，深入到偏僻的沿海渔村，同社员一起学习和讨论。
      许多革委会在大抓学习、宣传公报的同时，采取各种有效措施，狠抓落实工作。他们从检查执行毛主席一系列最新指示和以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令的情况入手，对照公报提出的各项战斗任务，找差距，排问题，订措施，雷厉风行地狠抓薄弱环节，推动了革命大批判和斗、批、改的胜利进行。洪泽县三河公社是叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇亲自去放过毒的地方，公社革委会的委员们学习了公报，带领群众，在全公社掀起了狠批刘少奇罪行的热潮，进一步调动了全社广大贫下中农革命和生产的干劲，到十一月六日就完成了秋收任务。苏州市延安区革委会举办了以落实全会号召为中心的机关干部毛泽东思想学习班，狠批了刘少奇在政权建设和干部问题上推行的修正主义路线，推动了机关的精兵简政和干部下放工作的顺利进行。淮安县南闸人民公社革委会和柏庄大队领导小组，通过举办学习班，对照公报，检查工作，充分发动群众，深挖暗藏的阶级敌人，使清理阶级队伍工作和革命大批判取得了新的成绩。
