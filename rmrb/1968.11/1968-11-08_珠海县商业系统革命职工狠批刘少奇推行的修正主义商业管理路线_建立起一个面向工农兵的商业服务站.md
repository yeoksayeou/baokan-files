Revolutionary workers in Zhuhai County's commercial system vigorously criticize Liu Shaoqi's revisionist commercial management line and establish a commercial service station serving workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The People's Daily reports: With the help of the PLA's support-left personnel, the commercial system in Guangdong's Zhuhai County, following Chairman Mao's great directive on "streamlining administration and reducing personnel," launched a fierce attack on the old institutions that do not fit the socialist economic base. They abolished the original County Commercial Bureau, Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and all departments of the seven companies, two factories, and one store under their jurisdiction, demoted 79.2% of the departmental personnel, and established a socialist commercial service station. The broad masses of the people reflected: "The old institutions had 'mountains' everywhere, competing for profits and bonuses, and were engaged in capitalist management; the new institutions have unified leadership, are revolutionary, and provide good service, and are on the socialist path."

In August of this year, after the revolutionary committees and leading groups at various levels in the commercial system were established, the revolutionary workers at all levels were very concerned about the work of streamlining administration and reducing personnel and urgently hoped that the revolutionary committees would quickly streamline the institutions and reform the unreasonable rules and regulations, and demote the departmental personnel. At that time, the revolutionary committees of various companies were only calculating within their own small circles and thought that business departments were different from government agencies, and that commercial work was a "one hole for one radish" situation, and after calculating, they thought this could not be reduced and that could not be reduced. After the PLA's support-left personnel discovered this situation, they went deep into the grassroots, conducted investigations and research, widely solicited the opinions of the masses, and fully mobilized the masses to contribute their ideas for streamlining administration and reducing personnel. Chairman Mao said: "The most intelligent and most talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience." In the process of soliciting opinions, a procurement officer told the PLA's support-left personnel: "In the past, the three companies of local products, timber, and production materials went to the mountainous areas to purchase goods, and each company sent a person. In fact, our business is basically the same, and one procurement officer from the three companies would be enough!" The procurement officer's rationalization proposal revealed a new way for business departments to streamline administration and reduce personnel. The PLA's support-left personnel immediately brought this opinion back to the revolutionary committee, combined it with the good experiences from other places, and discussed it with the responsible comrades. Everyone unanimously agreed: The commercial system must implement Chairman Mao's directive on "streamlining administration and reducing personnel," and must merge the County Commercial Bureau, Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and various companies, abolish all departments, and form a unified leadership of one unified leadership group.

However, after the plan to merge the commercial system's institutions was proposed, some cadres and financial accounting personnel had some fears. They were afraid that the scale was too large and things might go wrong; they were afraid of violating financial regulations; they were afraid that after merging and streamlining the institutions, it would be difficult to keep and difficult to demote. Therefore, they had many concerns and did not want to smash the old institutions. The PLA's support-left personnel realized: The attitude towards streamlining administration and reducing personnel is a reflection of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. They believed that to carry out this struggle and achieve victory, it is necessary to overthrow and criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the construction of political power and enterprise management in terms of ideology. Therefore, they enthusiastically helped the revolutionary committee lead the broad masses of workers and cadres to carry out a revolutionary criticism. They studied Chairman Mao's great directive on "streamlining administration and reducing personnel," investigated the harm of the many levels and cumbersome procedures in the commercial system's old institutions, dug out the roots of the many small mountains in the commercial system, and criticized the black goods sold by Liu Shaoqi in the construction of political power and enterprise management. This made the broad masses of workers and cadres increasingly clear about the direction of streamlining administration and reducing personnel, increasingly eager to smash the old institutions, increasingly aware that merging institutions is a good way for the commercial system to streamline administration and reduce personnel, and increasingly aware that only by merging institutions and eliminating small mountains can the commercial system block the black road of capitalist restoration.

In the revolutionary criticism, the broad masses of workers, through their own personal experiences, exposed and criticized the heinous crimes of Liu Shaoqi's agents in local areas who implemented the revisionist commercial management line and the "three guarantees and one reward" system (guaranteeing tasks, expenses, and profits, and rewarding excess). Because the revolutionary criticism was closely combined with the actual situation of the unit, everyone could see it and touch it, and it touched the soul deeply, raising the awareness of the struggle between the two lines quickly. They further realized: Only by criticizing "profits first" and "three guarantees and one reward" can we block the channel for capitalist restoration in terms of ideology; only by smashing the old institutions and eliminating small mountains and realizing the unified leadership of the commercial departments can we block the channel for capitalist restoration in terms of organization and ensure that the commercial system serves socialist construction and serves the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers! Those who originally did not understand the merger of institutions and had many concerns also raised their awareness in the revolutionary criticism, criticized conservative thoughts, and actively participated in the movement. In this way, as the revolutionary criticism deepened step by step, the merger of the commercial departments has become the will of the people and the trend of the times. Once the plan was approved by the masses, the entire commercial system acted swiftly, saying to do and doing it, and the socialist commercial service station was born in the fierce struggle between the two lines!

The advantages of merging the commercial system's institutions are: first, it makes the commercial system better serve the people, support production, and serve socialist construction.

Previously, the various units of the County Commercial System emphasized that the financial regulations were different, and based on their own small mountain's gains and losses, each set up their own retail department and sold their own goods. After the institutions were merged, they took the convenience of the people and the benefit of production as the criterion, consolidated the accounts, unified the allocation of goods, and reasonably arranged the sales. The procurement personnel can handle the delivery note in one office and then directly go to the warehouse to pick up the goods. The masses can buy the same type of goods and food in one retail department.

Secondly, after merging similar or related business institutions, it is more conducive to demoting departmental personnel. This commercial system originally had various institutions, "even a small sparrow has all the internal organs," each with its own set of departments, accounts, and reports, and thus each had its own group of financial, accounting, cashier, and price, allocation, procurement personnel, as well as other administrative personnel. Now, the original Commercial Bureau, Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and affiliated companies are merged into one, led by the service station's revolutionary committee, the original departments are abolished, and one person can do the work of several people. The entire commercial system demoted 122 people. Originally, there were 44 leaders at the level of bureau chief, director, and manager, and now the entire leadership and service personnel of the service station's revolutionary committee total only 32 people.

The superiority of merging institutions is also reflected in promoting the ideological revolutionization of cadres and workers. The cadre in charge of the People's Restaurant gets up at four in the morning and works with the restaurant workers to understand the food supply situation. Cadre Huang Jiliang, who was originally a butcher, was promoted to the position of food company manager. After the institutions were merged, he followed Chairman Mao's directive on "the reform of state organs, the most fundamental thing is to connect with the masses" and returned to the slaughterhouse, wearing his work clothes again and working with the workers. Now, the broad revolutionary workers in Zhuhai County's commercial system present a vibrant and moving scene.

    珠海县商业系统革命职工狠批刘少奇推行的修正主义商业管理路线
    建立起一个面向工农兵的商业服务站
    合并了县商业局、供销社和各公司，撤销了所属科室，实行统一领导，统一经营，大大方便了群众，促进了职工思想革命化，出现了一片朝气蓬勃的动人景象
    本报讯　广东珠海县商业系统在解放军支左人员的帮助下，遵循毛主席关于“精兵简政”的伟大教导，对不适合于社会主义经济基础的旧机构，发动了猛烈的冲击，撤销了原县商业局、供销社及其所属的木材公司等七公司两厂一店的所有科（股）室，下放了百分之七十九点二的科室人员，建立起一个社会主义商业服务站。广大群众反映说：“旧机构‘山头’如林，争利润，图奖金，搞的是资本主义经营；新机构统一领导，革命化，服务好，走的是社会主义大道。”
    今年八月，县商业系统各级革委会和领导小组成立后，广大革命职工十分关心精兵简政工作，迫切要求各级革委会迅速精简机构，改革不合理的规章制度，下放科室人员。当时，各公司革委会只在本公司的小天地里打算盘，总认为业务部门与政府机关不同，商业工作是一个萝卜一个坑，算来算去觉得这个不能减，那个也不能少。解放军驻商业系统支左人员发现这个情况后，就深入基层，作调查研究，广泛征求群众意见，充分发动群众为精兵简政献计献策。毛主席说：“最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”在征求意见中，一位采购员对解放军支左人员说：“以前我们土产、木材、生产资料三个公司进山区采购货物，都是各公司派一个人去的。其实我们的业务基本相同，三个公司共派一个采购员就够了！”采购员的合理化建议，揭示了业务部门精兵简政的新路子。解放军支左人员立即把这个意见带回革委会，结合外地的好经验，和负责同志共同研究，大家一致认为：商业系统要落实毛主席“精兵简政”的指示，就必须把县商业局、供销社以及各公司合并起来，撤销所有科室，形成一个统一领导的一元化的领导班子。
    但是，商业系统合并机构的方案提出后，有些干部和财务会计人员又产生了一些怕字。他们怕摊子大，弄不好会出乱子；怕违反财经制度；怕合并精简机构后，留着难干，下放难看。因而，顾虑重重，不愿砸烂原来的旧机构。解放军支左人员意识到：对待精兵简政的态度，是留恋守旧还是合并创新，这是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的反映。他们认为，要开展好这场斗争，并取得胜利，就必须从思想上批倒批臭刘少奇在政权建设和企业管理方面所推行的反革命修正主义路线。于是，他们就热情帮助革委会领导广大职工和干部开展革命大批判。大学毛主席关于“精兵简政”的伟大教导，大查商业系统旧机构层次多，手续烦琐的危害，大挖商业系统小山头多的根源，狠批刘少奇在政权建设和企业管理方面所贩卖的黑货。使广大职工和干部越学越明确精兵简政的方向，越查越想早日砸烂旧机构，越挖越看出合并机构是商业系统精兵简政的好路子，越批越感到只有合并机构，铲除小山头，才能堵死商业系统资本主义复辟的黑路。
    广大职工在革命大批判中，以自己的亲身经历，揭发批判了刘少奇在当地代理人所推行的修正主义商业管理路线和“三包一奖”制（包任务、费用、利润，超额受奖）的滔天罪行。由于革命大批判紧密地结合了本单位的实际，大家看得见，摸得着，触动灵魂深，提高路线斗争觉悟快，进一步认识到：只有批臭“利润挂帅”和“三包一奖”，才能在思想上堵死资本主义复辟的渠道；也只有砸烂旧机构，铲除小山头，实现商业部门的统一领导，才能在组织上堵死资本主义复辟的渠道，保证商业为社会主义建设服务，为工农兵群众服务！那些原来对合并机构很不理解，顾虑重重的人，也在革命大批判中提高了觉悟，批判了保守思想，积极投身运动之中。这样，随着革命大批判的步步深入，商业部门合并机构已经成为人心所向，大势所趋，方案一经群众通过，整个商业系统雷厉风行，说干就干，社会主义商业服务站就在两条路线的激烈搏斗中胜利诞生了！
    商业系统合并机构的好处是：首先使商业更好地面向群众，支援生产，为社会主义建设服务。
    以前，县商业系统的各单位，强调财经制度不同，从自己小山头的得失出发，各设各的门市部，各售各的商品。机构合并后，他们以方便群众，利于生产为准则，账目归拢了，货源统一调配，销售合理安排。购销员在一个办公室办好提货单，就可直接到仓库提货。群众购买同类用品、食品，在一个门市部就可满足。
    其次，同类或相似的业务机构合并后，更有利于下放科室人员。这个商业系统原来各机构，“麻雀虽小，五脏俱全”，各有各的一套科室、账目、报表，因而也各有各的一班财务、会计、出纳和物价员、调拨员、采购员以及其它行政人员。现在把原商业局、供销社和所属各公司合并起来，由服务站革委会统一领导，原来科室撤销了，一个人顶原来的几个人用。整个商业系统下放了一百二十二人。原来仅局长、主任、经理这一级领导干部就有四十四人，现在服务站革委会全体领导干部和服务人员总共才三十二人。
    合并机构的优越性，还表现在利于促进干部、职工的思想革命化。负责人民饭店的干部，早晨四点钟就起床，和饭店职工一面劳动，一面了解食品供应情况。领导干部黄继玲原是屠宰工，被提升为食品公司经理。机构合并后，他遵照毛主席关于“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众”的教导，又走进了屠宰场，重新穿起工作服，和职工一起劳动。现在，珠海县商业系统广大革命职工呈现一片朝气蓬勃的动人景象。
