With the firm support of the great socialist motherland and the unyielding struggle of Hong Kong patriots, New China News Agency Hong Kong Branch reporter Xue Ping was triumphantly released from prison on November 16. The Hong Kong patriotic news community held a warm welcome gathering, strongly demanding that the British authorities in Hong Kong immediately release the 13 patriotic news workers still in prison and all patriots illegally detained.

New China News Agency Hong Kong, November 19. With the firm support of the great socialist motherland and the unyielding struggle of Hong Kong patriots, New China News Agency Hong Kong Branch reporter Xue Ping, who was illegally detained by the British authorities in Hong Kong, was triumphantly released from prison on November 16. He was warmly welcomed by the entire staff of the branch and the Hong Kong patriotic news community.

Comrade Xue Ping was illegally arrested and imprisoned by the Hong Kong police while conducting normal reporting activities in the Wan Chai district on July 11, 1967, and was illegally sentenced. The British authorities in Hong Kong illegally imprisoned him for a year and four months.

Since May of last year, the British authorities in Hong Kong, fearing the widespread dissemination of the great thoughts of Chairman Mao in Hong Kong and fearing the exposure of their fascist atrocities, have viciously persecuted the reporters of the New China News Agency Hong Kong Branch and Hong Kong patriotic news workers. More than 30 patriotic news workers have been illegally arrested and sentenced. To this day, 13 patriotic news workers are still illegally imprisoned in the British authorities' black jails, living in inhuman conditions. This is an unprecedented and barbaric act in the history of international news.

On November 18, the Hong Kong patriotic news community held a gathering to warmly welcome Comrade Xue Ping's triumphant return. They also expressed their heartfelt greetings to the brave fighters, Comrade Xue Ping, and to the patriots who are still illegally detained in concentration camps and prisons by the British authorities in Hong Kong. The patriotic news workers attending the meeting angrily denounced the British authorities' arbitrary and unreasonable trampling of press freedom, strongly demanding that the British authorities in Hong Kong immediately release the 13 patriotic news workers still in prison and all patriots illegally detained.

At the welcome gathering, the patriotic news workers enthusiastically praised Comrade Xue Ping's heroic spirit of fighting to the end against the enemy. They said, "Xue Ping's triumphant return is a victory for the Hong Kong patriots in their resolute struggle against the British authorities in Hong Kong under the support of the great socialist motherland. It is a victory for the invincible thoughts of Chairman Mao. They solemnly declared that we must expose the atrocities of imperialism, we must defend the legitimate rights of patriots. To propagate the invincible thoughts of Chairman Mao is the supreme honor and sacred duty of patriotic news workers. The British authorities in Hong Kong, who dare to cover up the truth with one hand, are only 'lifting a rock to drop it on their own feet' and will inevitably suffer the consequences."

At the meeting, Comrade Xue Ping reported on the deeds of his fellow prisoners in prison over the past year and a half, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and bravely fighting against the British authorities. He said: "I am determined to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions for the rest of my life, to be a revolutionary news warrior forever loyal to Chairman Mao."

The entire staff of the New China News Agency Hong Kong Branch held a meeting on November 17 to warmly welcome Comrade Xue Ping's triumphant return. The director of the New China News Agency Hong Kong Branch, Liang Weilin, spoke at the meeting. He pointed out that currently, our reporter Luo Yuhe and 12 other patriotic news workers have not been released, and hundreds of patriots are still in concentration camps and black jails. They are all innocent. The British authorities in Hong Kong must immediately release them. He said, "We must raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, advance in victory, and ultimate victory will be ours."

　　在伟大祖国的坚决支持和香港爱国同胞的不断斗争下
　　新华社香港分社记者薛平胜利出狱
    香港爱国新闻界集会热烈欢迎，同时强烈要求港英当局立即释放仍在狱中的十三名爱国新闻工作者和所有被非法拘捕的爱国同胞
    新华社香港十九日电  在伟大社会主义祖国的坚决支持和香港爱国同胞的不断斗争下，被香港英国当局非法拘禁的新华社香港分社记者薛平同志，十一月十六日光荣出狱，受到了分社全体工作人员和香港爱国新闻界的热烈欢迎。
    薛平同志于一九六七年七月十一日在香港湾仔区进行正常采访活动时被港英警察无理拘捕并被非法判“罪”。港英当局把他非法投入黑狱长达一年零四个月之久。
    去年五月以来，港英当局因为害怕伟大的毛泽东思想在香港的广泛传播，害怕自己的法西斯暴行遭到揭露，悍然对我新华社香港分社记者及香港爱国新闻工作者进行疯狂的迫害，先后有三十多名爱国新闻工作者遭到非法拘捕和非法判“刑”。至今还有十三名爱国新闻工作者被非法拘禁在港英的黑狱中过着非人的生活。这是国际新闻史上罕有的、骇人听闻的野蛮行径。
    十八日，香港爱国新闻界举行集会，热烈欢迎薛平同志胜利归来，并向英勇斗争的薛平同志和目前仍被港英当局非法拘禁在集中营和监狱中的爱国同胞致以亲切慰问。参加大会的爱国新闻工作者愤怒控诉港英当局蛮横无理地践踏新闻自由的罪行，强烈要求港英当局立即释放仍在狱中的十三名爱国新闻工作者和所有被非法拘捕的爱国同胞。
    在欢迎会上，爱国新闻工作者热烈赞扬薛平同志威武不屈地同敌人斗争到底的英雄气概。他们说，薛平的胜利归来，是香港爱国同胞在伟大社会主义祖国支持下同港英当局进行坚决斗争所取得的胜利，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利。他们严正表示，帝国主义的暴行，我们一定要揭发，爱国同胞的正当权益，我们一定要维护。宣传战无不胜的毛泽东思想，更是爱国新闻工作者无上光荣的神圣职责。港英当局妄想只手遮天，封锁住真理的声音，只不过是“搬起石头打自己的脚”，必将自食恶果。
    会上，薛平同志报告了狱中战友一年多来活学活用毛主席著作，同港英当局进行英勇斗争的事迹。他表示：决心一辈子读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做一个永远忠于毛主席的革命新闻战士。
    新华社香港分社全体工作人员，怀着激动的心情，在十七日举行大会，热烈欢迎薛平同志光荣归来。新华社香港分社社长梁威林在会上讲了话。他指出，目前，我社记者罗玉和同志以及其他十二名爱国新闻工作者还没有被释放，数百名爱国同胞还在集中营和黑狱中。他们都是无罪的。港英当局必须立即释放他们。他说，我们必须更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，乘胜前进，最后胜利是属于我们的。
