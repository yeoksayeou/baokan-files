One evening, people of all ethnic groups in Lhasa, holding blazing torches, held an unprecedented grand parade to celebrate the publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party.

In the vast parade, there were some young men and women dressed in long, oversized fur coats, their bodies robust and their dark faces glowing red in the torchlight. They were particularly excited, repeatedly raising their arms and shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long, long live Chairman Mao!"

They were liberated herdsmen who had just arrived in Lhasa from the snow-covered northern Tibetan plateau.

It was late at night. They returned to their lodging, too excited to sleep. Some gathered together to discuss the great significance of the communiqué, while others immediately wrote letters home to share the joyous news with the liberated herdsmen on the vast grasslands, urging them to study and deeply understand the spirit of the communiqué, and to strive for the great battle tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee.

The next day, the herdsmen rushed to the bus station to buy tickets, determined to return to the northern Tibetan plateau as quickly as possible to propagate the communiqué of the plenary session and spread the voice of the great leader Chairman Mao.

Among these liberated herdsmen, some were illiterate. They held the Tibetan-language edition of the *Tibet Daily* with the communiqué, asking literate people to read it to them over and over again, and to listen to the broadcast of the communiqué repeatedly.

While studying and discussing the communiqué of the plenary session, the liberated herdsmen criticized the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary "theory of the merits of exploitation" by recalling the cruel exploitation and oppression they suffered under the feudal serf system. They excitedly said, expelling Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever and revoking all his positions inside and outside the Party is truly a great relief! We liberated herdsmen support this a thousand times, ten thousand times!

The liberated herdsmen are infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's voice has given the liberated herdsmen tremendous encouragement. With their profound proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao, they immediately composed many songs praising the communiqué, expressing their determination: The liberated serfs of Tibet will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unite more closely around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, resolutely carry out all the great calls of the plenary session, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    翻身牧民纵情歌唱
    一日晚，拉萨各族革命人民高举烈焰熊熊的火炬，举行了盛况空前的游行，热烈庆祝党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的发表。
    在浩浩荡荡的游行队伍中，有一些穿着又长又大的皮袄、身体十分健壮的男女青年，黝黑的面孔被火炬照得通红。他们心情特别激动，不断振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”
    他们是刚从风雪弥漫的藏北草原来到拉萨的翻身牧民。
    夜深了。他们回到住宿地点，激动得不能入睡。有的围在一起，热烈讨论公报的伟大意义，有的立即给家里写信，把这特大的喜讯告诉千里草原的翻身牧民，要求牧民们认真学习、深刻领会公报的精神，为实现党的八届十二中全会提出的各项伟大战斗任务而努力奋斗。
    第二天，牧民们就赶到汽车运输站买车票，决心最快地赶回藏北草原，去宣传全会公报，传播伟大领袖毛主席的声音。
    在这些翻身牧民当中，有一部分人不识字。他们拿着登有公报的藏文版《西藏日报》，请识字的人一遍又一遍地读给他们听，并一遍又一遍地收听公报的广播。
    翻身牧民们在学习讨论全会公报时，以自己在农奴制度下所受的残酷剥削和压迫，批判了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命的“剥削有功论”。他们激动地说，把刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外的一切职务，真是大快人心！我们翻身牧民一千个拥护，一万个拥护！
    翻身牧民无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，毛主席的声音给了翻身牧民巨大的鼓舞。他们怀着对毛主席无限深厚的无产阶级感情，立即编出很多歌颂公报的歌曲，表达他们的决心：西藏翻身农奴一定更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更紧密地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决执行全会的各项伟大号召，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
