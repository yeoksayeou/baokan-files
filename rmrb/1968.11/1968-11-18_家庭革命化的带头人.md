The deaf-mute student Wang Baocai was once a notorious "troublemaker." In school, teachers couldn't control him. At home, his parents would shake their heads at the sight of him. When the family held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, he didn't participate. He also had no part in the struggle sessions against selfishness and revisionism. In this way, Wang Baocai became an "outsider" in the family's revolutionization.

Now, if you visit Wang Baocai's home, you'll see a different scene. Learning revolutionary songs? It's Wang Baocai who teaches. At the family's struggle sessions against selfishness and revisionism, Wang Baocai takes the lead in speaking. Studying Chairman Mao's works? Wang Baocai serves as the instructor. Today's Wang Baocai has truly become the pioneer of family revolutionization.

To talk about Wang Baocai's transformation, we must go back to when the medical and propaganda team of the People's Liberation Army, carrying Mao Zedong Thought, came to the deaf-mute school.

In March of this year, the medical and propaganda team of the 3016th Unit of the People's Liberation Army arrived at the deaf-mute school. They saw that the agents of the traitor Liu Shaoqi not only physically abused the deaf-mute students but also poisoned their minds. In the lower grades, they taught about cats, dogs, and monkeys reaching for the moon; in the higher grades, they taught metalworking and carpentry, aiming to make money. They taught all sorts of things but never taught Mao Zedong's Little Red Book or class struggle. These people intended to make the deaf-mute students not only physically deaf and mute but also politically deaf and mute.

The team members, with deep hatred for Liu Shaoqi and profound proletarian feelings for the deaf-mute students, helped Wang Baocai with acupuncture while studying Chairman Mao's works together and jointly criticizing Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes. Under the patient guidance of the PLA comrades, Wang Baocai quickly raised his political awareness. At a denunciation and criticism meeting, Wang Baocai angrily said: "Liu Shaoqi, this big villain, pushed the revisionist line in the medical and health sector, refusing to treat the poor and lower-middle peasants and not letting us hear Chairman Mao's voice, not letting us study Mao Zedong Thought. Now, Chairman Mao has given me good ears, and I will use them to listen to Chairman Mao's words. Chairman Mao has made my mouth able to speak, and I will use it to propagate Mao Zedong Thought."

Since then, Wang Baocai truly changed. He firmly follows Chairman Mao's instructions. Whoever listens to Chairman Mao, he learns from; whatever goes against Mao Zedong Thought, he firmly opposes. Wang Baocai's mother was originally the head of the neighborhood committee, but due to her age and the many household chores, she had the thought of not wanting to continue. Wang Baocai knew this and studied the "Three Articles" with his mother, severely criticizing the traitor Liu Shaoqi. He said to his mother: "It's Chairman Mao who saved our family. We should wholeheartedly listen to Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao tells us to 'completely selfless and devoted to others,' 'serve the people wholeheartedly,' but you don't want to take on the heavy burden. Is this right to Chairman Mao?" His mother, hearing Wang Baocai's words, was deeply moved and said, "Child, you're right. We should do as Chairman Mao says. Mother will definitely work harder and use actual actions to repay Chairman Mao."

　　家庭革命化的带头人
    聋哑学生王保才，过去是有名的“调皮鬼”。在学校里，老师管不住他。到家里，爸爸妈妈见他就摇头。家里办毛泽东思想学习班，他不参加。开斗私批修讲用会又没有他的份。就这样，王保才成了家庭革命化的“编外人员”。
    现在，到王保才家里看看，可就大不一样了。学习革命歌曲，是王保才教；家庭斗私批修会上，王保才抢先发言；学习毛主席著作，王保才担任辅导员。今天的王保才，成了家庭革命化的真正的带头人。
    要说王保才的变化，还得从解放军毛泽东思想医疗宣传队进聋哑学校时谈起。
    今年三月，三○一六部队毛泽东思想医疗宣传队来到聋哑学校，看到大叛徒刘少奇的代理人不仅在肉体上摧残聋哑同学，更恶毒的是从思想上毒害聋哑同学。在聋哑学校，低年级学的是小猫、小狗、猴子捞月亮等等；高年级学的是铁工、木工，挣钱吃饭。学这学那，就是不学毛主席的红宝书，就是不学阶级斗争。这些家伙妄图使聋哑同学不仅在生理上是聋哑，在政治上也是聋哑。
    宣传队的同志抱着对刘少奇的刻骨仇恨和对聋哑同学深厚的无产阶级感情，在给王保才扎针治病的过程中，和他一起学习毛主席著作，共同批判刘少奇的滔天罪行。在解放军同志的耐心帮助下，王保才很快提高了政治觉悟。在一次控诉和批判大会上，王保才愤恨地说：刘少奇这个大坏蛋在医疗卫生战线上推行修正主义路线，不给贫下中农治病，也不让我们听到毛主席的声音，不让我们学习毛泽东思想。现在，毛主席他老人家给了我一双好耳朵，我要用它听毛主席的话，毛主席使我的嘴巴能说话，我要用它宣传毛泽东思想。
    打这以后，王保才真的变了。毛主席的指示，他坚决照办。谁听毛主席的话，他就向谁学习；那件事违背了毛泽东思想，他就坚决反对。王保才的母亲原来是街道居民委员会主任，由于上了年纪，家务事又多，产生了不愿再干的念头。王保才知道了，就和妈妈一起学习“老三篇”，狠批叛徒刘少奇。他对妈妈说：“是毛主席救了咱一家，咱要一心听毛主席的话。毛主席叫咱‘毫不利己专门利人’，‘全心全意地为人民服务’，你却不愿挑重担，这对得起毛主席吗？”他妈妈听了王保才的话很受教育，激动地说：“孩子，你说得对。毛主席怎么说咱就应该怎么干。妈妈一定要把工作干得更好，拿实际行动来报答毛主席他老人家。”
