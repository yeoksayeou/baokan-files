The historic significance of the Party's Eighth Plenum of the Twelfth Central Committee is immense. We, the entire staff and soldiers of the Zigong City Military Affairs Department in Sichuan Province, are once again immersed in boundless happiness. We shout a thousand and ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!

Looking back on the arduous struggle of the past two years, we deeply feel that victory has not come easily. In the early stages of the Cultural Revolution, the traitor Liu Shaoqi eagerly threw out a bourgeois reactionary line, standing on the bourgeois reactionary position, and carried out a mad suppression of revolutionary masses. Liu Shaoqi's agents in Sichuan Province and Zigong City vigorously promoted the reactionary line of their black master, casting a white terror over Zigong City. In May 1960, the traitor Liu Shaoqi personally came to Zigong, attempting to win over and corrupt people to prepare for his restoration of capitalism. When the revolutionary masses rose up to rebel against them, they used counter-revolutionary tricks, trying to extinguish the revolutionary flames.

A thunderous roar shook the heavens, the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee was issued, and Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" shone like a beacon, illuminating our path forward, and we saw that within the Party there was a bourgeois headquarters led by the traitor Liu Shaoqi. We are revolutionary soldiers loyal to Chairman Mao, and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is our glorious duty. We resolutely and unshakably promoted, actively implemented, and firmly executed the resolutions of the Eighth Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, joining the broad masses to thoroughly criticize the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. When the revolutionary masses were fighting the hardest, the great leader Chairman Mao issued the order: "The People's Liberation Army should support the revolutionary masses." We unhesitatingly and resolutely supported the revolutionary actions of the masses. The military and the people united and fought side by side, striking fear into the hearts of a handful of class enemies.

However, in February of last year, the traitor Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices stirred up a "February Countercurrent." Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we continued to fight alongside the broad revolutionary masses, resolutely withstanding this evil wind.

In the most arduous moments of the struggle, we looked towards Beijing, our hearts turned to Chairman Mao, and we recited over and over again: "Darkness is about to pass, dawn is ahead," "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, striving for victory." Reading a passage from Chairman Mao's quotations increased our strength to defeat the enemy, and studying Chairman Mao's works added to our fighting confidence. Together with the revolutionary masses, we swore to Chairman Mao: "Our heads may be cut off, our blood may flow, but Chairman Mao's revolutionary line will not be abandoned." We are determined to fight to the end to defend Chairman Mao and to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

In May of last year, the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party on handling the situation in Sichuan, personally approved by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, was issued. "The storm falls from the sky for me," "Sweeping away thousands of troops like rolling up a mat," Sichuan immediately presented a great revolutionary situation. However, class struggle is tortuous and complex. Soon, the agents of the traitor Liu Shaoqi in Sichuan stirred up another evil wind to reverse the "February Countercurrent." We resolutely executed the orders of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, closely united with the broad revolutionary masses, and firmly defended Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, repelling the counterattack of a handful of class enemies and achieving new victories.

In the midst of the great and decisive victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nationwide, Chairman Mao personally presided over the Eighth Plenum of the Twelfth Central Committee, issuing new battle calls to us. We are determined, under the radiant guidance of the communiqué of the plenary session, to fully play the leading role of the working class, continue to deeply carry out the revolutionary criticism, thoroughly sweep away the reactionary bourgeois thoughts of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party such as Liu Shaoqi, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    毛主席领导我们不断前进
    四川省自贡市人民武装部
    具有伟大历史意义的党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表了，我们自贡市武装部全体指战员又一次沉浸在无比幸福之中。大家千遍万遍地高呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！
    回顾两年来的艰苦斗争历程，我们深深感到，胜利来之不易。文化大革命初期，叛徒刘少奇迫不及待地抛出了一条资产阶级反动路线，站在资产阶级反动立场上，对革命群众进行了疯狂镇压。刘少奇在四川省和自贡市的代理人竭力推行其黑主子的资产阶级反动路线，自贡市笼罩着一片白色恐怖。一九六○年五月间叛徒刘少奇亲自来到自贡，招降纳叛，为他复辟资本主义作组织准备。当革命群众起来造他们的反的时候，他们就施展反革命伎俩，企图扑灭革命烈火。
    一声霹雳震天响，党的八届十一中全会公报发表了，毛主席的《炮打司令部》的大字报象灯塔一样照亮了我们前进的方向，使我们看到了党内还埋藏着一个以叛徒刘少奇为代表的资产阶级司令部。我们是忠于毛主席的革命战士，捍卫毛主席革命路线是我们的光荣职责。我们坚定不移地大力宣传，积极贯彻，坚决执行八届十一中全会的决议，和广大群众一起大造党内一小撮走资派的反。当革命群众战斗最艰苦的时候，伟大领袖毛主席下达了“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的命令。我们毫不犹豫地坚决支持革命群众的革命行动。军民团结并肩战斗，使一小撮阶级敌人吓破了胆。
    可是，去年二月间，叛徒刘少奇及其同伙又刮起了一股“二月逆流”。我们在毛泽东思想的指引下，同广大革命群众一道，继续战斗，坚决顶住了这股邪风。
    在斗争最艰苦的时刻，我们眼望北京城，心向毛主席，一遍又一遍朗诵：“黑暗即将过去，曙光即在前头”，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”。读一段毛主席语录，就增加一分战胜敌人的力量，学一遍毛主席著作，就增添一分战斗的信心。我们同革命群众一起向毛主席宣誓：“头可断，血可流，毛主席革命路线不可丢。”我们决心为保卫毛主席，为捍卫毛主席革命路线战斗到底。
    去年五月，毛主席和林副主席亲自批准的《中共中央关于处理四川问题的决定》下达了。“狂飙为我从天落”、“横扫千军如卷席”，四川立即出现一片大好革命形势。但是，阶级斗争是曲折的复杂的，不久，叛徒刘少奇在四川的代理人，又刮起了一股为“二月逆流”翻案的邪风。我们坚决执行以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的命令，紧紧团结广大革命群众，坚决捍卫毛主席的革命路线，打退了一小撮阶级敌人的反扑，取得了新的胜利。
    在全国无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大的、决定性的胜利的凯歌声中，毛主席又亲自主持召开了党的八届扩大的十二中全会，向我们发出了新的战斗号召。我们决心在全会公报的光辉照耀下，充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，继续深入展开革命大批判，彻底肃清刘少奇等党内最大的一小撮走资派的反革命修正主义的思想，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
