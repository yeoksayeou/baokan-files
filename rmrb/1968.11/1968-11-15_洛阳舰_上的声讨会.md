On the joyous day when the people and military personnel across the nation enthusiastically welcomed the publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, on the glorious "Luoyang" ship, which the great leader Chairman Mao inspected fifteen years ago, all the officers and soldiers, filled with boundless proletarian love for the great leader Chairman Mao, held a grand meeting to angrily denounce the heinous crimes of traitor Siu Chao-chih.

Captain Zhu Xueqing and all the officers and soldiers, holding up red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," solemnly took an oath before the portrait of Chairman Mao. Then, the old crew member of the "Luoyang" ship, Xue Liuqiang, with boundless happiness, recounted the scene fifteen years ago when the great leader Chairman Mao boarded the "Luoyang" ship. He said, "Our great leader Chairman Mao walked through every compartment on our warship, asking about our well-being, having heart-to-heart talks with us, and personally wrote the brilliant directive, 'To oppose the aggression of imperialism, we must definitely build a powerful navy.' Chairman Mao boarding our ship is the greatest honor and happiness for sailors! Siu Chao-chih, that scoundrel, in 1958 also sneaked onto our ship, spreading poison, attacking our great leader Chairman Mao, and attacking the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao is our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman. We have boundless love, admiration, loyalty, and faith in Chairman Mao. Siu Chao-chih opposes Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought; he is our sworn enemy. We must overthrow him and never let him rise again."

Immediately, the deck echoed with roars:

"Overthrow whoever opposes Chairman Mao!"

"Overthrow whoever opposes Mao Zedong Thought!"

"Overthrow whoever opposes Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!"

"Overthrow the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Siu Chao-chih!"

Ten years ago, the current gunnery officer, Xu Hehua, who witnessed Siu Chao-chih sneaking onto the "Luoyang" ship, stepped onto the critical review platform amidst the roars. With a heart full of rage, he said, "Siu Chao-chih, this despicable traitor, during the domestic revolutionary war, repeatedly kowtowed to the enemy, betraying the revolution; after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, he actively promoted the capitulationist line, attempting to surrender the armed forces to the Kuomintang; after the liberation of the mainland, he snuggled up to the capitalists, shamelessly praising them, and suppressing the working class. All these incidents clearly show that Siu Chao-chih is a thorough traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader!"

The compartment soldier, Le Shubeng, who attended the first conference of active learners and propagators of Mao Zedong Thought in the Navy and had the fortune of seeing the great leader Chairman Mao, with deep hatred for Siu Chao-chih, bitterly denounced the "exploitation is glorious" theory of the great capitalist-roader Siu Chao-chih. He said, "Siu Chao-chih, this scoundrel, advocates what 'exploitation is glorious.' Glorious in what way? This 'glory' is our working class and poor peasants' family destruction, separation of spouses, and children. We say: 'Exploitation is a crime!' 'Deserves to die a thousand times!' Different trees bear different flowers, different classes speak different words. Siu Chao-chih and the landlords and capitalists wear the same pants, sit on the same bench, clap the same hands, sing the same tune, breathe from the same nostril, and are completely the filial sons and grandsons of the landlord class and the bourgeoisie, a thorough capitalist-roader!"

Officers and soldiers took turns denouncing Siu Chao-chih on the platform. They fiercely exposed and criticized Siu Chao-chih's counter-revolutionary crimes with a large number of living facts. The officers and soldiers, with hearts full of excitement, expressed that the decision of the Twelfth Plenum of the Party to permanently expel the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Siu Chao-chih from the Party and revoke all his Party and non-Party positions fully expresses our sailors' wishes. We support it a thousand times, ten thousand times! We will definitely respond to the various calls and fully implement the various combat tasks proposed in the communiqué!

The bright sunlight illuminated the deck of the "Luoyang" ship, making it exceptionally bright. The sailors, filled with the joy of victory, sang the revolutionary song "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" and marched forward to victory along the revolutionary course pointed out by Chairman Mao!

　　“洛阳舰”上的声讨会
    在全国亿万军民热烈欢呼党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表的大喜日子里，在伟大领袖毛主席十五年前视察海军舰艇部队时乘坐过的光荣的“洛阳舰”上，全体指战员满怀对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的无产阶级感情，举行了大会，愤怒声讨刘少奇叛党叛国的滔天罪行。
    舰长朱学清和全体指战员，手擎红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，在毛主席像前庄严地宣誓后，“洛阳舰”老舰员薛柳祥首先怀着无比幸福的心情，追述了十五年前伟大领袖毛主席登临“洛阳舰”的情景。他说，我们伟大领袖毛主席在我们军舰上走遍了每个舱室，向我们问寒问暖，同我们促膝谈心，还亲自挥动扭转乾坤的巨手，写下了“为了反对帝国主义的侵略，我们一定要建立强大的海军”的光辉指示。毛主席登上咱们舰，这是水兵最大的光荣，最大的幸福！刘少奇这个坏蛋一九五八年也窜上我们舰，大放其毒，攻击伟大领袖毛主席，攻击战无不胜的毛泽东思想。毛主席是我们的伟大导师，伟大领袖，伟大统帅，伟大舵手，我们对毛主席无限热爱、无限崇拜、无限忠诚、无限信仰。刘少奇反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，就是我们不共戴天的敌人，我们就要把他打翻在地，再踏上一只脚，叫他永世不得翻身。
    顿时，甲板上响起一阵阵怒吼声：
    “谁反对毛主席就打倒谁！”
    “谁反对毛泽东思想就打倒谁！”
    “谁反对毛主席的革命路线就打倒谁！”
    “打倒叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇！”
    十年前曾目睹刘少奇窜上“洛阳舰”的现任枪炮长徐共和，在怒吼声中登上了大批判讲台。他满腔怒火地说，刘少奇，这个不齿于人类的大叛徒，在国内革命战争时期，就一次又一次奴颜婢膝地跪倒在敌人的脚下，叛变革命；抗日战争胜利以后，他又积极推行投降主义路线，妄想交出武装向国民党投降；祖国大陆解放以后，他又一头钻进了资本家的怀抱，无耻地吹捧资本家，镇压工人阶级。这一件件，一桩桩，那一点不说明了刘少奇是个彻头彻尾的叛徒、内奸和工贼！
    苦大仇深的舱段兵、出席过海军首次活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会代表、幸福地见到伟大领袖毛主席的寿伯根，怀着对刘少奇的刻骨仇恨，以血泪斑斑的家史，痛斥了大工贼刘少奇的“剥削有功论”。他说，刘少奇这个大坏蛋鼓吹什么“剥削有功”，“功”在哪里？这个“功”就是我们工人阶级和贫下中农的家破人亡，妻离子散。我们说：“剥削有罪！”“罪该万死！”什么树开什么花，什么阶级说什么话。刘少奇和地主资本家穿的是一条裤子，坐的是一条凳子，打的是一个拍子，唱的是一个调子，一个鼻孔里出气，完全是地主阶级、资产阶级的孝子贤孙，是个十足的大工贼！
    登台声讨刘少奇的干部和战士，一个接着一个。他们以大量的活生生的事实，狠揭猛批刘少奇的反革命罪行。指战员怀着万分激动的心情表示，党的十二中全会关于永远开除叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的党籍，撤消他党内外一切职务的决定，充分表达了我们水兵的心愿，我们一千个拥护，一万个拥护！我们一定要坚决响应公报提出的各项号召，全面落实公报提出的各项战斗任务！
    灿烂的阳光，把“洛阳舰”的甲板照得分外明亮。水兵们怀着胜利的喜悦，高唱《大海航行靠舵手》的革命歌曲，沿着毛主席指引的革命航向胜利前进！
