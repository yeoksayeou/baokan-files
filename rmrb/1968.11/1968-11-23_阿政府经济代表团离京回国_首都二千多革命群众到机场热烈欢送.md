The Albanian Government Economic Delegation, led by Adil Çarçani, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and Deputy Prime Minister of the Albanian Council of Ministers, has concluded its friendly visit to China. On the 20th, they departed from Beijing by airplane, via Shanghai, to return home.

More than 2,000 revolutionary masses from the capital, holding high portraits of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, gathered at the capital airport, where the flags of the two countries were flying, to give a warm send-off to the Albanian comrades. The banners held by the welcoming crowd bore prominent slogans: "Heartily congratulate the great victory of Albania's revolutionary movement!" "Resolutely support and implement the communiqué and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China!"

Adil Çarçani and other Albanian comrades, accompanied by Li Xiannian, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council, bade farewell to the welcoming crowd. The revolutionary masses beat drums and waved the flags of China and Albania, shouting slogans: "Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Albania!" "Long live the Albanian Labor Party!" "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Down with U.S. imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism! Down with all reactionaries!" "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"

Those who went to the airport to see them off also included leaders from relevant government departments and the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, Lin Haiyun, Lai Jifa, Xu Jinqiang, Qiao Guanhua, Li Qiang, Zhong Yiyi, and Xiang Qian, as well as representatives of the Five Good Soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing.

Vice Minister of the State Economic Commission Xie Huai and Albanian Ambassador to China Natanaeli and Commercial Counselor Kozma accompanied the delegation to Shanghai.

Diplomatic officials from the Albanian Embassy in China and other Albanian comrades in Beijing went to the airport to see them off.

When the Albanian comrades left Shanghai, more than 1,000 revolutionary masses, along with Wang Shaoqing, Wang Chenglong, and Feng Guozhu, members of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee, and responsible comrades of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai, Liu Wenxue, Duan Dezhang, and Wang Weiguo, went to the airport to give them a warm send-off.
