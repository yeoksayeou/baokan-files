The night was already deep, but a small thatched hut next to the pigsty of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army was still lit. The cold of late autumn in the northern frontier was intense, but the two soldiers inside the hut felt a surge of warmth. Their hearts were illuminated and ignited by the torch of the communiqué!

The red waves of the radio broadcast the decision of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee to expel the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever and to revoke all his positions within and outside the Party. New livestock keeper Wu Xiaohua couldn't help but shout joyfully: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years! Little Wu heard the plenum's call to continue deepening the revolutionary criticism and struggle, to thoroughly sweep away the reactionary revisionist thoughts of Liu Shaoqi and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and his heart was filled with fighting spirit. He thought about how he had been poisoned by Liu Shaoqi's "read books to become an official" and "join the Party to become an official" ideas of fame and profit, and was not content with his pig-keeping work. He decided to set up a battlefield that very night, seeking the help of the old livestock keeper Sun Chengrong to fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism, responding to the communiqué's call to action with practical deeds.

Old Sun is an active learner of Mao Zedong Thought. He had just handed over his duties to Little Wu and was preparing to attend the meeting of representatives of the Four Good Units. After hearing the communiqué broadcast, he thought about Little Wu's state of mind and felt uneasy.

Little Wu is a junior high school graduate. Before enlisting, he was the leader of the production brigade of a commune. After enlisting, he became a scout and always performed well, being evaluated as a Five Good Soldier during the initial assessment. Not long after, due to work needs, the leadership assigned him to be a livestock keeper. The young man had a knot in his heart, feeling that it was not right to go from being a "leader" to a "pig keeper," and dared not write home, and felt a bit ashamed to face people. As if to make things difficult for him, as soon as he started work, a small pig fell ill. He shyly pushed the cart to take the small pig to the veterinary hospital, but the treatment was ineffective and the pig died. Comrades had some discussions, and Little Wu was even more troubled. Sun Chengrong thought about this, his face burning with shame, feeling that he had not done a good job of handing over duties in terms of ideology, and decided to use the momentum of the communiqué to make up for this lesson in handing over duties.

The pair of old and new soldiers met enthusiastically by the pigsty, exchanged their intentions, and immediately began to study the communiqué in the small thatched hut. Little Wu spoke out his real thoughts as he studied. Old Sun recalled the bitterness and sweetness as he studied, talking about his family's three generations of toiling for the landlord, suffering oppression and exploitation, and talking about Liu Shaoqi's crimes of pushing "three freedoms and one contract" to restore capitalism. He earnestly told Little Wu: "If we do not overthrow Liu Shaoqi and thoroughly sweep away his reactionary revisionist thoughts, we will suffer twice the hardships and twice the bitterness!" Little Wu also came from a suffering background. Talking about Liu Shaoqi's crimes, he gnashed his teeth in hatred. During the three years of difficulty, under the support and incitement of the big traitor Liu Shaoqi, the class enemies in the brigade where Little Wu was located stirred up trouble, attacking the poor and lower-middle peasants. Little Wu and his grandfather stood up to fight back, resulting in persecution. Thinking of these things, Little Wu angrily shouted: "Down with Liu Shaoqi!" He firmly said: "I want to be a leader, not a pig keeper, it is because I was poisoned by the reactionary revisionist ideas of fame and profit of the big traitor, big spy, and big capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi's 'join the Party to become an official' and 'read books to become an official.' If this continues, how dangerous it would be! I will definitely study and apply the 'Three Articles' thoroughly, completely and thoroughly for the people, follow Chairman Mao, and always do revolution."

The night was already deep, but the light in the hut shone brighter and brighter, and the soldiers' hearts rolled with revolutionary passion.

    公报照亮了饲养员的心
    夜已经很深了，解放军某部猪圈旁的一间小草棚里，依然亮着灯光。塞北的深秋，寒气逼人，草棚里一对战士却感到热气腾腾，他们的心被公报的火炬照亮了，灼热了！
    红色电波，传来党的八届扩大的十二中全会把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党，并撤消其党内外一切职务的决议，新饲养员吴小华情不自禁地纵情欢呼：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！小吴听了全会继续深入展开革命大批判，肃清刘少奇等党内最大的一小撮走资派的反革命修正主义思想的战斗号召，内心充满了战斗的激情。他想到自己就是受了刘少奇“读书做官论”、“入党做官论”等名利思想的毒害，不安心喂猪工作，决定连夜摆战场，找老饲养员孙成荣同志帮助，斗私批修，以实际行动响应公报的战斗号召。
    老孙是学习毛泽东思想积极分子。他刚刚交班给小吴，准备参加部队四好连队代表会议。听了公报广播，联想到小吴的思想情况，心里很不平静。
    小吴是个初中生，入伍前是公社生产大队领导班子的主任，入伍以后当了侦察兵，一直表现不错，初评时被评为五好战士。不久，因工作需要，领导上调他当饲养员。小伙子思想上有疙瘩，由“主任”变“猪倌”，总觉得不是味，不敢给家里写信，见了人也有点抬不起头来。仿佛故意和他为难似的，一上班，就有一只小猪得病，他羞羞答答，推着小车把小猪送到兽医院，医治无效死了，同志们有些议论。小吴更加苦恼。孙成荣想到这里，脸上火辣辣的，感到自己没有从思想上交好班，决定借公报的东风补好交班这一课。
    一对新老战士，兴致勃勃地在猪圈旁相遇了，互道了来意，两人立即在小草棚里学起公报来。小吴边学边亮自己的活思想。老孙边学边忆苦思甜，他谈到自己家庭三代给地主扛活，受压迫受剥削的苦难生活，谈到刘少奇搞“三自一包”复辟资本主义的罪恶，语重心长地对小吴说：“不打倒刘少奇，不彻底肃清他的反革命修正主义思想，就要吃二遍苦，受二茬罪啊！”小吴也是受苦出身，谈起刘少奇的罪恶，恨得直咬牙。三年困难时期，在大叛徒刘少奇的支持煽动下，小吴所在大队的阶级敌人兴风作浪，打击贫下中农，小吴和他的爷爷奋起斗争，结果遭到迫害。想到这些，小吴愤怒地高呼：“打倒刘少奇！”他坚定地说：“我愿当主任，不愿当猪倌，就是受了大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇的‘入党做官论’、‘读书做官论’等反革命修正主义名利思想的毒害，发展下去，是多么危险呀！我一定活学活用‘老三篇’，完全彻底为人民，跟着毛主席，永远干革命。”
    夜已经很深了，草棚里的灯光越照越明，战士的心里滚动着革命的激情。
