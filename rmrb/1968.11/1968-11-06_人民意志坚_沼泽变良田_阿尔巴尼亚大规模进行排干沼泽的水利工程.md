Albania is currently undertaking large-scale water conservancy projects to drain marshes. During the fourth five-year plan (1966-1970), Albania's work in draining marshes and expanding irrigation areas increased by 80% compared to the entire third five-year plan. This amount of work is equivalent to the total work done in draining marshes and expanding irrigation areas from 1945 to 1962.

One of the largest water conservancy projects during the fourth five-year plan is the drainage of the Hotova Marsh. The Hotova Marsh stretches along the Adriatic coast in the Ferri region between the Seman River and the Vjosa River. This massive project aims to improve 22,000 hectares of land, including about 7,000 hectares of marshland and the rest being land without drainage channels. Under the leadership of the Albanian Labour Party, the Albanian government is paying great attention to the drainage of the Hotova Marsh. Although the project has only been underway for two years, the landscape of the marsh has already changed significantly. Due to the hard work of the workers involved in this project, especially the enthusiasm generated by the revolutionary movement, 5,000 hectares of marshland have been cultivated with crops, and one of Albania's largest state farms will be established here.

The main drainage network of the Hotova Marsh has also been successfully completed, and a large pumping station is now discharging years of accumulated marsh water into the sea. Currently, another irrigation network and the 55-kilometer-long Vjosa-Levan-Ferri canal project are also being accelerated. Once these projects are completed, they will create favorable conditions for agricultural harvests in this region.

In addition to the drainage project in the Hotova Marsh, the Albanian government is also simultaneously carrying out various drainage and irrigation projects in the Malig Lake Marsh, the Terbuf Marsh, and the Kakaliki Lake Marsh in Lezha. Once these projects are completed, the Albanian people will further increase agricultural and pastoral production from the new fertile land.

    阿尔巴尼亚大规模进行排干沼泽的水利工程
    新华社地拉那一日电　阿尔巴尼亚正在大规模进行排干沼泽的水利工程。在第四个五年计划（一九六六年——一九七○年）期间，阿尔巴尼亚在排干沼泽和扩大灌溉面积方面的工作量，比第三个五年计划整个期间所完成的工作量扩大了百分之八十，它等于从一九四五年到一九六二年期间，在排干沼泽和扩大灌溉面积方面工作量的总和。
    第四个五年计划期间最大的水利工程之一——排干霍察拉沼泽地工程正在加速进行。霍察拉沼泽地伸展在亚得里亚海岸边的费里区境内的塞曼河和维约萨河之间。这项巨大工程计划改良土地二万二千公顷，其中大约有七千公顷是湖沼地，其余都是没有排灌渠道的土地。在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，阿尔巴尼亚政府以极大的关注，进行霍察拉沼泽地的排干工程，虽然工程只进行了两年，但沼泽地的面貌已起了很大变化。由于参加这项工程的工人的辛勤劳动，特别是在革命化运动开展的热潮中，发挥了干劲，使五千公顷的湖沼地种上了农作物，并将在这里建成阿尔巴尼亚最大的国营农场之一。
    霍察拉沼泽地的主要排水网也已胜利建成，一个巨大的抽水机站正在把多年的湖沼积水排除到海里去。目前，另一排灌网和全长五十五公里的维约萨—勒旺—费里运河工程也正在加速进行，这些工程建成后，将为这一地区的农作物丰收创造良好条件。
    阿尔巴尼亚政府除在霍察拉沼泽地进行巨大的排干沼泽工程以外，还在马利格湖沼、特尔布夫沼泽地、莱希的卡卡利基湖沼等地区同时进行各项排灌工程。这些工程建成后，阿尔巴尼亚人民将从新的肥沃的土地上进一步提高农牧业生产。（附图片）
