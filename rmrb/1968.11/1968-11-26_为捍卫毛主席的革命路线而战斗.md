At a time when we are implementing the tasks set forth by the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee and taking practical actions to welcome the convening of the Ninth Party Congress, Chairman Mao's brilliant historical document, "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China," has been republished. The central newspapers and journals have simultaneously published an important editorial, "Seriously Study the History of the Struggle Between the Two Lines," conveying Chairman Mao's latest directives on conducting education on the struggle between the two lines. This is another great strategic deployment by the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. Chairman Mao's report and the latest directives are great programs for deepening the struggle between the two lines, powerful ideological weapons for greatly raising the awareness of the struggle between the two lines among hundreds of millions of revolutionary people, and for thoroughly criticizing the reactionary line represented by Liu Shaoqi. We, the one million two hundred thousand industrial workers of Shanghai, enthusiastically acclaim, wholeheartedly support, earnestly study, and resolutely implement these directives.

By studying Chairman Mao's report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee and Chairman Mao's latest directives, as well as the important editorials from the central newspapers and journals, we have a deeper understanding that within our Party, there has always been a sharp struggle between the two lines. The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao represents the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses, guiding the revolution from victory to victory, consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing the restoration of capitalism, and achieving the victory of socialism and communism. The reactionary line represented by the counter-revolutionary leader Liu Shaoqi represents the interests of imperialism, modern revisionism, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the bourgeoisie, leading China into darkness, and overthrowing the dictatorship of the proletariat to restore capitalism. The history of our Party and the history of the people's revolution led by the Party is a history of the struggle between the two lines, a history of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line repeatedly defeating and smashing the left and right opportunist lines of Chen Duxiu, Qu Qiubai, Li Lisan, Wang Ming, and especially the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie represented by Liu Shaoqi.

The Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters is a fighting force of the working class formed and developed in the fierce struggle between the two lines, a revolutionary force fighting under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the death.

Under the great call of Chairman Mao to "Bombard the Headquarters" and inspired by the decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally drafted by Chairman Mao, the Shanghai working class broke through the white terror of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, established worker revolutionary rebel organizations, united with the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat, and with the support of the People's Liberation Army, engaged in heroic and repeated struggles against the bourgeois headquarters led by Liu Shaoqi and their agents in Shanghai, such as Chen Pixin and Cao Qichao. In January 1967, the worker revolutionary rebels and the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the entire city, with great heroism, smashed the counter-revolutionary economic wind stirred up by Tan Zhenlin and others, repelled the new counterattack of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, and through direct revolutionary actions, seized back the power usurped by a small handful of capitalist roaders from the bottom up, pronouncing the death sentence on the old Shanghai Municipal Committee led by Chen Pixin and Cao Qichao. Subsequently, we repeatedly eliminated interference from the class enemy from the right or the ultra-left, which is left in form but right in essence. The high tides of revolutionary criticism, revolutionary unity, revolutionary three-in-one combination, and struggle, criticism, and transformation have surged one after another. All these victories were achieved under the personal care and direct command of the great leader Chairman Mao and under the inspiration and guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Through more than two years of tempering and testing in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the awareness of the struggle between the two lines among the broad revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses has been greatly heightened. However, many of our comrades still lack understanding and knowledge of the history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party. They often only see the struggle between the two lines during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and do not understand or do not fully understand the fierce struggle between the two lines since the founding of the nation and even the several decades since the founding of the Communist Party of China. This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is precisely the continuation and decisive battle of the fierce struggle between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and Liu Shaoqi's reactionary line of the bourgeoisie over the past forty-plus years. To have a deeper understanding of the great historical significance of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and to have a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's brilliant theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, we must study the history of the struggle between the two lines over the past several decades, especially the past ten-plus years.

"Historical experience is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, should be constantly and repeatedly spoken about. It is not enough to speak to a few people; the broad revolutionary masses must know about it." Chairman Mao's latest directive summarizes the experiences and lessons of the proletarian revolution at home and abroad and is a long-term and eternal plan for anti-revisionism and preventing revisionism.

We, the Shanghai working class, are determined to immediately respond to the battle call of the proletarian headquarters, closely combine the study of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, and swiftly and thoroughly launch a movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines to greatly heighten our awareness of the struggle between the two lines.

In the movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines, the working class must play a leading, exemplary, and backbone role. We must firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and carry the struggle between the two lines to the end!

    为捍卫毛主席的革命路线而战斗
    上海工人革命造反总司令部
    正当我们贯彻执行党的八届扩大的十二中全会提出的各项任务，以实际行动迎接党的九大召开的时候，毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》这篇光辉的历史文献重新发表了。中央两报一刊同时发表了重要社论《认真学习两条路线斗争的历史》，传达了毛主席关于进行两条路线斗争教育的最新指示。这是以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的又一个伟大的战略部署。毛主席的报告和最新指示，是深入开展两条路线斗争的伟大纲领，是大大提高亿万革命人民的两条路线斗争觉悟、彻底批判刘少奇为代表的资产阶级反动路线的最强大的思想武器。我们上海一百二十万产业工人最热烈地欢呼，最衷心地拥护，最认真地学习，最坚决地贯彻。
    我们重新学习毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告，学习毛主席的最新指示和中央两报一刊的重要社论，更深切地认识到：在我们党内一直尖锐地存在着两条路线的斗争。以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，代表着无产阶级和广大革命人民的根本利益，是指引革命从胜利走向胜利的路线，是巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，胜利建设社会主义、共产主义的路线。以反革命头子刘少奇为代表的资产阶级反动路线，代表着帝国主义、现代修正主义、国民党反动派和资产阶级的利益，是把中国引向黑暗的路线，是颠覆无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义的路线。我们党的历史，和党所领导的人民革命的历史，就是两条路线的斗争史，就是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线不断击溃、粉碎陈独秀、瞿秋白、李立三、王明的“左”右倾机会主义路线，特别是以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级反动路线的历史。
    我们上海工人革命造反总司令部，就是在两条路线的激烈斗争中形成和发展起来的一支工人阶级的战斗队伍，就是在伟大领袖毛主席和中国共产党领导下，为誓死捍卫毛主席的革命路线而战斗的革命队伍。
    上海工人阶级在毛主席《炮打司令部》的伟大号召下，在毛主席亲自主持制定的《关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》鼓舞下，冲破资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖，成立了工人革命造反组织，联合广大无产阶级革命派，在中国人民解放军的支持下，同以刘少奇为首的资产阶级司令部及其在上海的代理人陈丕显、曹荻秋之流开展了英勇的反复的搏斗。一九六七年一月，工人革命造反派和全市无产阶级革命派以大无畏的英雄气概，粉碎了谭震林之流刮起的反革命经济主义妖风，击退了资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，并且用直接的革命行动，自下而上地夺回了被一小撮走资派篡夺了的大权，宣判了以陈丕显、曹荻秋为首的旧上海市委的死刑。接着，不断排除了阶级敌人来自右的方面或极“左”即形“左”实右方面的干扰，革命大批判、革命大联合、革命三结合以及斗、批、改的高潮，一浪更比一浪高。这一切胜利，都是在伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀和直接指挥下取得的，都是在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的鼓舞和指引下取得的。
    经过两年多来的无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼和考验，广大革命造反派和革命群众的两条路线斗争的觉悟大大提高。但是，我们很多同志，对于党内两条路线斗争的历史还是缺乏了解和认识的。往往只看到无产阶级文化大革命期间的两条路线的斗争，而不了解或不大了解建国以来的十多年以至中国共产党成立以来的几十年的两条路线的激烈斗争。这场无产阶级文化大革命，正是四十多年来毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和刘少奇的资产阶级反动路线激烈斗争的继续和大决战。要更深刻地认识这场无产阶级文化大革命的伟大历史意义，更深刻地理解毛主席关于在无产阶级专政下继续革命的光辉学说，我们就必须学习几十年来特别是建国十多年来两条路线斗争的历史。
    “历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”毛主席这一最新指示，总结了国内国际无产阶级革命的经验教训，是反修防修的百年大计，万年大计。
    我们上海工人阶级决心立即响应无产阶级司令部的战斗号召，紧密结合党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的学习，雷厉风行地深入开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动，来大大提高我们的两条路线斗争的觉悟。
    我们工人阶级一定要在两条路线斗争史的学习运动中，发挥带头作用、模范作用、骨干作用。一定坚定不移地站在毛主席革命路线一边，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，把两条路线斗争进行到底！
