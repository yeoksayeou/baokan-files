British progressives and others residing in Britain enthusiastically welcomed the successful convening of the Twelfth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the publication of the plenum's communiqué.

A British worker pointed out that this plenum, chaired by Chairman Mao Zedong, and the resolution to expel Liu Shaoqi from the party and strip him of all his positions within and outside the party, marked a great decisive victory for China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This victory, achieved after more than two years of intense class struggle, is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

He also happily pointed out that in China, the working class is playing a tremendous role in exercising proletarian dictatorship in all spheres of the superstructure, especially in the educational revolution. He said, "We welcome Chairman Mao's instruction: 'Our country has a population of 700 million, and the working class is the leading class. The leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work must be fully brought into play. The working class should also continuously raise its political consciousness in the struggle.' He said, Chairman Mao's above instruction has given British workers another weapon to counter imperialist and revisionist anti-China propaganda.

An Indian friend residing in Britain said that the successful convening of the Twelfth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC is a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and Mao Zedong Thought. He said, this is a heavy blow to imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism led by the Soviet revisionists. He also pointed out that during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, hundreds of millions of Chinese people directly participated in exposing the true counter-revolutionary revisionist face of Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices, which is a great victory for Chairman Mao's mass line.

A group of young workers from the West Indies also joyfully welcomed the publication of the communiqué, celebrating the new victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They emphasized that Liu Shaoqi's thorough defeat and his expulsion from the party is not only a great victory for the Chinese people but also a great victory for all revolutionary people around the world.

They said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has educated hundreds of millions of people at home and abroad. Revolutionary people around the world can now understand Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought more quickly and clearly than before. This is of great significance to us."

According to Xinhua News Agency, the news of the publication of the communiqué of the Twelfth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC reached a port in Tianjin, where foreign seamen immediately became ecstatic, enthusiastically celebrating the success of this historic meeting and the great victories of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Some foreign seamen in the International Seamen's Club, upon hearing this inspiring news, excitedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!" They eagerly requested various foreign language versions of the communiqué from the club's staff. Many seamen, to celebrate the publication of this great news, also took photos in front of Mao's statue as a keepsake. Some Pakistani and Somali seamen, while celebrating the publication of the communiqué of the Twelfth Plenum, enthusiastically shouted, "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" They also chanted slogans: "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Down with all reactionaries!" "Down with the Chinese Khrushchev Liu Shaoqi!"

A Greek seaman told a Chinese port worker, "The Chinese Khrushchev Liu Shaoqi is a capitalist-roader in power and should be overthrown. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought!" This seaman sincerely wished Chairman Mao eternal life!

A Pakistani seaman said, "The Chinese Khrushchev has been overthrown, showing the tremendous power of invincible Mao Zedong Thought, ensuring that China will forever advance along the road of proletarian revolution!" He said, "The publication of the communiqué of the Twelfth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC, we revolutionary people around the world are extremely happy to hear, but the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and their running dogs are very afraid. The U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists are about to perish."

    新华社伦敦九日电　英国和旅居英国的进步人士热烈欢呼中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会的胜利召开和全会公报的发表。
    一位英国工人指出，由毛泽东主席亲自主持的这次全会和这次全会作出的把刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外一切职务的决议，标志着中国无产阶级文化大革命取得了伟大的决定性胜利。这一胜利是经过两年多的尖锐的阶级斗争后取得的，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    他还高兴地指出，现在在中国，工人阶级在上层建筑各个领域特别是在教育革命中实行无产阶级专政方面，起着巨大的作用。他说：“我们欢呼毛主席的这一指示：‘我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。’”他说，毛主席的上述指示，给了英国工人阶级反击帝国主义和修正主义反华宣传又一个武器。
    一位旅居英国的印度朋友说，中国共产党第八届扩大的十二中全会的胜利召开，是毛主席的革命路线和毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。他说，这是对以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏修为首的现代修正主义的一个沉重打击。他还指出，在无产阶级文化大革命期间，亿万中国人民直接参加了揭露刘少奇及其同伙的反革命修正主义的真面目，这是毛主席的群众路线的伟大胜利。
    一批来自西印度群岛的青年工人，也兴高采烈地欢呼公报的发表，欢呼无产阶级文化大革命和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的新胜利。他们强调指出，刘少奇的彻底失败，他的被开除出党，不但是中国人民的伟大胜利，而且也是全世界一切革命人民的伟大胜利。
    他们说：“无产阶级文化大革命，教育了中国国内外的亿万人民。世界革命人民现在可以比以前更迅速更清楚地领会马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想了。这对我们是有巨大意义的。”
    据新华社八日讯　中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会公报发表的消息传到天津的一个海港时，在那里的外国海员顿时欢腾起来，热烈欢呼这次具有伟大历史意义的会议成功和中国无产阶级文化大革命取得的伟大胜利。
    正在国际海员俱乐部里的一些外国海员听到这个振奋人心的消息后，激动地欢呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”他们纷纷向俱乐部的工作人员索取各种外文版的公报。不少海员为了欢庆这个特大喜讯的发表，还特意在毛主席塑像前照像留念。一些巴基斯坦和索马里海员在欢庆十二中全会公报的发表时，热情欢呼：“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！”他们还高喊口号：“打倒美帝！”“打倒苏修！”“打倒各国反动派！”“打倒中国赫鲁晓夫刘少奇！”
    一位希腊海员对中国港务人员说：“中国赫鲁晓夫刘少奇是一个走资本主义道路的当权派，应该打倒。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！”这位海员热诚地敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！
    一位巴基斯坦海员说：“中国赫鲁晓夫被打倒了，显示了战无不胜的毛泽东思想的巨大威力，保证了中国永远沿着无产阶级革命的道路前进！”他说：“中国共产党八届扩大的十二中全会公报的发表，我们世界革命人民听了都无比高兴，美帝、苏修和他们的走狗听了却非常害怕。美帝、苏修快完蛋了。”
