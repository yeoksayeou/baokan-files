I started working as a custodian at Beijing No. 1 Middle School at the age of sixteen, and it has been more than twenty years now. Before the Cultural Revolution, I saw that the school was controlled by bourgeois intellectuals, nurturing revisionist seeds, and I was filled with anger. Two incidents have stayed with me ever since.

One morning in 1965, a student's parent, dressed in work clothes and carrying a lunchbox, came to give his son a pen, saying his son had left home early and forgotten his pen. As soon as he entered the guardroom, we started chatting warmly. I asked him what he did, and he happily replied, "I am a sewer cleaner at XX factory." Just then, his son ran over excitedly, but as soon as he saw his father talking to me and heard him say he was a sewer cleaner, his face turned red. He glared at his father and snapped, "Who told you to come?" He snatched the pen and ran off. Seeing this, both the old worker and I were furious. The old worker stamped his feet and pounded his chest, cursing his son for forgetting his roots. Another time, a high-ranking official from another province came to visit his son in a small car. Later, someone asked the student who that was, and he tilted his head and stuck out his thumb, proudly saying, "That's my dad!" How many such incidents were there? We workers all have this experience: some new middle school students can still get along with workers, but the higher they go, the more distant they become from workers. Once they become college students, they look down on workers even more.

At first, I blamed these students. They eat the grain grown by farmers, wear the cloth woven by workers, and live in buildings constructed by workers. Every desk and chair in the classroom, which part is not created by the working people? Without the working people, could you go to school? But why doesn't the son of a sewer cleaner recognize his father? In the old society, the exploiting class advocated "those who work with their brains rule, those who work with their hands are ruled." The working class lived at the bottom, and the bourgeoisie called them "stinky laborers" and "country bumpkins." Now that we are liberated, it is Chairman Mao who has saved us from the sea of suffering. We proletarians have seized political power, and the working people have become the masters of the socialist motherland. But why do teenagers in their teens look down on the working people and aspire to be officials?

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has exposed Liu Shaoqi and other top walkers of the capitalist road within the Party. A large number of class struggle facts have made me understand that the reason students look down on the working people is the evil result of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line promoted by Liu Shaoqi. He falsely claimed that "mastering a profession, becoming famous and successful in the future," he shouted about cultivating "cadres," "technicians," "engineers," cultivating "ministers," "deputy ministers," becoming "cadre" at the county, provincial, and central levels, but he never mentioned becoming a worker, a peasant, or an ordinary laborer. I hate a thousand times, a million times, I cannot hate the students, I hate Liu Shaoqi, this big villain. He is the creator of the "study to become an official" theory.

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our educational policy should enable those who receive education to develop morally, intellectually, and physically, and become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture." Liu Shaoqi poisons the youth with the reactionary thought of "study to become an official," precisely to cultivate the youth into "superior people" who ride on the heads of the working people, to be his tools for restoring capitalism. We workers must, together with revolutionary teachers and revolutionary students, do a good job in the struggle-criticism-transformation of the school, and criticize the fallacy of "study to become an official."

### 永远做普通劳动者

    永远做普通劳动者
    北京一中工人　杨文宗
    我十六岁就在北京一中当工友，到现在已经二十多年了。文化大革命前，看到学校被资产阶级知识分子统治着，培养些修正主义苗子，就憋了一肚子气。有两件事使我一直不能忘记。
    一九六五年的一天早晨，一位穿工作服的学生家长提着饭盒给儿子送钢笔，说儿子早起上学，忘了带钢笔。一进传达室，我俩就亲热地谈起来了，我问他干什么，他高兴地说：“我是××场的掏粪工人。”正在这时，他儿子兴冲冲地跑来了，可一看见他爸爸和我说话，又说自己是个掏粪工人，脸刷地一下红了，瞪了他爸爸一眼，说了声“谁让你来的？”抢过钢笔就跑了。看到这种情形，我和这位老工人肺都气炸了，老工人跺脚捶胸，大骂儿子忘了本。又有一次，一位在外地工作的高级干部，坐着小汽车来学校看望儿子。事后，有人问这位学生那是谁，他把小脑袋一歪，大拇指一竖，得意地说：“是我的爸爸！”象这样的事何止这一两件呢？我们工人都有这样一个体会：有的新入学的初中生还能和工人接近，越升级就越和工人疏远了，当上了大学生，就更看不起工人了。
    开始，我怪这些学生，吃的是农民种的粮，穿的是工人织的布，住的是工人盖的楼房，课堂桌椅，那一点不是劳动人民创造的？离开了劳动人民，你们能上学吗？可是为什么掏粪工人的儿子不认爸爸？在旧社会，剥削阶级宣扬“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”，工人阶级生活在最底层，被资产阶级称为“臭苦力”，“土包子”。如今解放了，是毛主席把我们从苦海中拯救出来，我们无产阶级掌握了政权，劳动人民成了社会主义祖国的主人翁。但为什么十几岁的青少年却看不起劳动人民，而向往当干部呢？
    无产阶级文化大革命，揪出了刘少奇等党内最大的一小撮走资派。大量的阶级斗争事实，使我明白了，原来学生看不起劳动人民，是刘少奇所推行的反革命修正主义教育路线带来的恶果。他胡说什么“学好一门专业，将来成名成家”，他叫嚷培养什么“干部”“技术员”“工程师”，培养什么“部长”、“副部长”，当“乡、县、省干部，也可以到中央”，他左一个干部，右一个工程师，就是没有当工人，当农民，当普通劳动者。千恨万恨，不能恨学生，都恨刘少奇这个大坏蛋。他是“读书做官”论的炮制者。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。”刘少奇用“读书做官”论的反动思想毒害青年，就是要把青年培养成为骑在劳动人民头上的“人上人”，做他复辟资本主义的工具。我们工人一定和革命的教员、革命的学生一起，搞好学校的斗批改，批臭“读书做官”的谬论。
