In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our unit has recruited a batch of new Party members, injecting fresh blood into the company's Party branch and adding new strength. In the great storms of class struggle, these new Party members have played a significant role and have been greatly tempered.

Last August, the higher authorities decided to send one of our comrades to support agriculture. Who should go? Some comrades said that supporting agriculture is on the front line of class struggle, so a cadre should go for "safety." Others thought that there are too few cadres, so they can't go, and it's better to send an old soldier or an old Party member. After the Party branch discussed it, it was decided to send the new soldier and new Party member, Yu Chengren.

As soon as the issue was raised, some comrades said, "Little Yu is reckless and has just joined the Party. If he goes, he might not be able to complete the task." The Party branch organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's great teaching on "Communist Party members should experience storms and see the world," and everyone's understanding became unified. It was decided that Yu Chengren should go to take on the agricultural support work.

After Little Yu arrived at the Taipingwan Production Brigade, he followed Chairman Mao's instructions to rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, consulted with the masses on every matter, and humbly learned from the poor and lower-middle peasants. He quickly established a deep proletarian affection with them. The poor and lower-middle peasants' boundless love for Chairman Mao and their actions deeply educated him, providing him with rich political nourishment and raising his class consciousness.

Once, Little Yu went to the commune for a meeting and suddenly noticed a large fire on a distant mountain. "Fire is the enemy, and firelight is the command," he thought. He immediately organized more than thirty nearby commune members to rush to the fire scene, charging into the fire and, after more than an hour of fierce battle, finally extinguished the mountain fire. Yu Chengren's brave act of saving state property deeply moved the commune members.

In the Taipingwan Production Brigade, Yu Chengren also did many good deeds for the poor and lower-middle peasants. Whenever the poor and lower-middle peasants in this brigade mentioned him, they praised him as a "living Lei Feng" and a "guardian of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."

Having a deep proletarian affection for the poor and lower-middle peasants and a deep hatred for class enemies is the quality of a proletarian revolutionary fighter. The continuous victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have forced the class enemies' activities to become more cunning. Yu Chengren paid attention to observing the enemy's movements, relying on the masses, mobilizing the masses, and in a landlord's house, he found evidence of counter-revolutionary activities such as "reversal accounts." This incident provided a lot of material for the masses' criticism and greatly enhanced the masses' class vigilance.

In the storms of class struggle, Little Yu's class standpoint was further strengthened, his position became more firm, and his level of struggle was raised. His original shortcomings were greatly overcome. After being tested in the struggle, he has become a formal member of the Communist Party of China and was elected as a representative to attend the Jilin Province "Three Supports, Two Militaries" Active Learners and Appliers of Mao Zedong Thought Conference.

From Yu Chengren's growth process, we have come to understand that we must send new Party members to the front line of class struggle for tempering, letting them "experience storms and see the world," and swim in the vast sea. Only in this way can they truly learn the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen proletarian feelings, and serve the laboring people forever. Only in this way can they continuously raise their awareness of the two-line struggle, temper their loyalty to Chairman Mao, and become vigorous Communist Party members who fight to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line while alive and dedicate themselves to it while dead.

### 在阶级斗争的风浪中锻炼成长

　　在阶级斗争的风浪中锻炼成长
　　空军某部汽车连长　张学森
    无产阶级文化大革命以来，我们吸收了一批新党员，给连队党支部注入了新鲜血液，增添了新生力量。在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，这些吸收到党内来的无产阶级新鲜血液发挥了很大作用，也得到了很大的锻炼。
    去年八月，上级决定要我们连去一个同志支农，让谁去呢？有的同志说，支农是阶级斗争的第一线，干部去“保险”。也有的同志认为，干部少，去不了，还是挑一个老战士、老党员去吧。党支部研究以后，决定让新战士、新党员尤成仁去。问题一提出，有的同志就说，小尤做事莽撞，又刚刚入党，去了恐怕完不成任务。党支部组织大家学习了毛主席关于“共产党员应该经风雨，见世面”的伟大教导，大家的认识统一了，决定还是让尤成仁去担任支农工作。
    小尤到太平川大队以后，遵照毛主席依靠贫下中农的教导，遇事和群众商量，虚心向贫下中农学习，很快地和贫下中农建立了深厚的无产阶级感情。贫下中农无限热爱毛主席，无限忠于毛主席的思想和行动深深地教育了他，使他吸取了丰富的政治营养，提高了阶级觉悟。
    一次，小尤到公社去开会，突然发现远处山上起了大火。“火灾就是敌人，火光就是命令。”他想到这里，马上组织附近三十多名社员群众跑到火场，冲入火海，经过一个多小时的激烈战斗，终于把山火扑灭了，尤成仁同志抢救国家财产的英勇行为，使社员群众深受感动。
    在太平川大队，尤成仁同志还为贫下中农做了许多好事。这个大队的贫下中农一提起他，都称赞他是“活雷锋”、“捍卫毛主席革命路线的好战士”。
    对贫下中农的无产阶级感情无比深厚，对阶级敌人无比憎恨，是一个无产阶级革命战士的品质。无产阶级文化大革命的节节胜利，迫使阶级敌人的活动变得更加狡猾了。尤成仁注意观察敌人的动向，依靠群众，发动群众，在一个地主分子家里翻出了变天账等反革命罪证。这件事给广大群众提供了大批判的活材料，大大提高了群众的阶级警惕性。
    在阶级斗争的疾风暴雨中，小尤的阶级观点进一步加强了，立场更加坚定了，斗争的水平也有了提高，原来的缺点得到很大的克服。经过斗争的考验，他已经成为一个中国共产党的正式党员，并且被选为出席吉林省“三支”、“两军”活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会的代表。
    从尤成仁同志的成长的过程中，我们认识到，必须把新党员放到阶级斗争的第一线去锻炼，让他们“经风雨，见世面”，在大江大海里游泳。只有这样，才能使他们真正学到战无不胜的毛泽东思想，增强无产阶级思想感情，永远为劳动人民服务；只有这样，才能使他们不断地提高两条路线斗争觉悟，锤炼对毛主席的一颗忠心，成为生为捍卫毛主席革命路线而战斗，死为捍卫毛主席革命路线而献身的朝气勃勃的共产党员。
