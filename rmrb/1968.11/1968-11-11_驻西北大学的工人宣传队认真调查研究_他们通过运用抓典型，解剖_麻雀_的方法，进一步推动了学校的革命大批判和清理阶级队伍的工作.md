The worker propaganda team stationed at Northwest University has conducted thorough investigations and studies. By using the method of focusing on typical cases and dissecting "sparrows," they have further promoted the school's revolutionary criticism and the cleansing of class ranks.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Xian, November 10th: The worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at Northwest University has conducted thorough investigations and studies. By using the method of focusing on typical cases and dissecting "sparrows," they have further promoted the school's revolutionary criticism and the cleansing of class ranks.

Northwest University established a revolutionary committee in June of last year. The school's revolutionary criticism and the cleansing of class ranks have achieved some success. However, as the revolution deepens, the weaknesses of intellectuals, such as their incomplete and wavering revolution, have gradually been exposed. Some teachers and students have shown signs of slackening their revolutionary spirit and being satisfied with the status quo, making it difficult for the revolutionary criticism and the cleansing of class ranks to proceed further. Some teachers and students have said, "After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, the revolutionary criticism and the cleansing of class ranks have been mostly completed. We have fought and criticized enough. We just need to make a few more changes!"

The team members of the worker propaganda team believe that this "good enough" mentality is a major obstacle to the deepening of the struggle, criticism, and reform. If this ideological barrier is not removed and this "obstacle" is not eliminated, the educational revolution in the school cannot be carried out thoroughly.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Are you unable to solve a certain problem? Then investigate the present state and the history of that problem! Once you have thoroughly investigated and understood it, you will have the means to solve it." The worker propaganda team, following this great teaching of Chairman Mao, conducted extensive and in-depth investigations and studies on the history and current state of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines in this school. In addition to general surveys, they also chose the Mathematics Department, which was one of the earliest to rebel, had the greatest influence, and was considered to have done all its work "well enough," as a key focus for dissecting "sparrows." The team members used methods such as holding various small-scale investigation meetings, heart-to-heart talks, home visits, and individual conversations to conduct thorough and detailed investigations and studies. They discovered that the class struggle in the Mathematics Department was extremely sharp and complex. Although the surface-level class enemies had been exposed, those who were deeply hidden and cunningly operating were still active. For example, there was a counter-revolutionary disguised as a "leader" who, during the Cultural Revolution, appeared as an "old rebel," pretending to be revolutionary while engaging in counter-revolutionary criminal activities. After learning of this situation, the team members of the worker propaganda team conducted extensive propaganda on Chairman Mao's teachings about class and class struggle in the Mathematics Department and mobilized the masses to launch a struggle against the enemy. Through the education and help of the worker propaganda team, the revolutionary teachers and students in this department quickly raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and actively exposed the crimes of this counter-revolutionary, eventually exposing him. Once the hidden class enemies were exposed, the situation in the Mathematics Department changed dramatically, and the revolutionary criticism and the cleansing of class ranks quickly began to develop.

After gaining experience in the Mathematics Department, the worker propaganda team immediately focused on this typical case and promoted it throughout the school. When the "good enough" typical case of the Mathematics Department was presented, the revolutionary teachers and students in some "good enough" units reassessed their work; those with the "good enough" mentality began to doubt their views.

At this time, the worker propaganda team, seizing the opportunity, held Mao Zedong Thought study classes in various classes and departments, focusing on deepening the revolutionary criticism and the cleansing of class ranks. In these classes, the team members organized the revolutionary teachers and students to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, severely criticize the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi's theory of the extinction of class struggle, and use the Mathematics Department as a living example to guide everyone to find the gap between their unit's class struggle and their own ideological state, and catch up. After the study, the "good enough" mentality was overcome, and the class consciousness and the consciousness of the struggle between the two lines of the broad revolutionary teachers and students were greatly enhanced.

After raising their ideological awareness, the broad revolutionary teachers and students actively exposed the activities of class enemies, severely criticized the counter-revolutionary crimes of class enemies, and launched a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies. The Biology Department of this school has always been known as a "three-no-one-red" unit, claiming that it had "no rightists in the past, no capitalist roaders now, and no reactionaries in the cleansing of class ranks, making it a red Biology Department." After the revolutionary teachers and students raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, they quickly uncovered the class struggle cover of this department and dug out the deeply hidden class enemies. The revolutionary teachers and students of the History Department, who originally only exposed, expelled, and ignored class enemies, now deeply carried out revolutionary criticism, not only severely criticized the counter-revolutionary crimes of a handful of class enemies but also further exposed the evil facts of a handful of class enemies secretly engaging in sabotage activities.

In leading the broad revolutionary teachers and students to launch a fierce attack on class enemies, the worker propaganda team guided everyone to closely combine revolutionary criticism with the cleansing of class ranks, using revolutionary criticism to pave the way for the cleansing of class ranks. At the same time, they used the bad people and bad deeds exposed in the cleansing of class ranks as living examples to promote the deepening of revolutionary criticism. In this way, they mutually promoted and closely coordinated, making the revolutionary criticism and the cleansing of class ranks in the entire school continuously deepen and develop. The entire campus became a battlefield for revolutionary criticism, and a handful of hidden traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries were one by one exposed.

The living facts of class struggle have given the broad revolutionary teachers and students a very profound education. They generally felt that before the worker propaganda team entered the school, the work of this school was not "good enough" but "far from good." Many revolutionary teachers and students, when recalling the great change in their thoughts from "good enough" to "far from good," more deeply realized the great significance of Chairman Mao's instruction that "to achieve a proletarian educational revolution, there must be leadership by the working class" for carrying out the struggle, criticism, and reform in the school. They said that the facts have proven that to thoroughly carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform in the school, there must be strong leadership by the working class. Relying on us intellectuals alone is not enough to carry out the educational revolution to the end. Everyone is determined to accept the re-education of the working class, learn the thorough revolutionary spirit of the working class, transform their worldview, and achieve new merits in the school's struggle, criticism, and reform.

　　驻西北大学的工人宣传队认真调查研究
    他们通过运用抓典型，解剖“麻雀”的方法，进一步推动了学校的革命大批判和清理阶级队伍的工作
    据新华社西安十日电  进驻西北大学的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，认真做调查研究，运用抓典型，解剖“麻雀”的领导方法，进一步推动了学校的革命大批判和清理阶级队伍的工作。
    西北大学在去年六月间就成立了革命委员会，学校的革命大批判和清理阶级队伍工作取得了一定的成绩。但是，随着革命的深入发展，知识分子的革命不彻底性和动摇性的弱点逐渐暴露出来。一些师生产生了斗志松懈、满足现状的现象，使革命大批判和清理阶级队伍的工作深入不下去。有些师生说，学校革委会成立以后，革命大批判和清理阶级队伍工作都搞得差不多了，斗也斗了，批也批了，只要再改一改就行啦！
    工人宣传队的同志认为，这种“差不多”的思想，是深入开展斗、批、改的“拦路虎”，不扫除这种思想障碍，不打掉这只“拦路虎”，学校的教育革命就不能搞到底。
    毛主席教导说：“你对于那个问题不能解决么？那末，你就去调查那个问题的现状和它的历史吧！你完完全全调查明白了，你对那个问题就有解决的办法了。”工人宣传队遵照毛主席的这一伟大教导，深入各班级、各科室，对这个学校阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的历史和现状，进行了广泛深入的调查研究。他们除普遍的摸底以外，还选择了在全校造反最早，影响最大，各项工作都被认为搞得“差不多”的数学系，作为重点，解剖“麻雀”。宣传队的同志采取召开各种小型调查会、谈心会、登门走访、个别谈心等方法，从各方面进行了深入细致的调查研究以后，发现数学系阶级斗争十分尖锐复杂，浮在表面上的阶级敌人虽然已经揪了出来，隐藏得深、手段很狡猾的反革命分子却仍在继续活动。如有一个披着“领导干部”外衣的反革命分子，在文化大革命中以“老造反”的面目出现，假装革命，进行反革命罪恶活动。工人宣传队的同志了解到这一情况后，便在数学系大力宣传毛主席有关阶级和阶级斗争的论述，广泛发动群众开展对敌斗争。经过工人宣传队的教育和帮助，这个系的革命师生迅速提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，纷纷起来揭发这个反革命分子的罪行，终于把他揪了出来。暗藏的阶级敌人一揪出，数学系的形势立刻大变，革命大批判和清理阶级队伍的工作很快开展起来了。
    工人宣传队在数学系取得经验以后，立即抓住这个典型，在全校介绍推广。数学系这个“差不多”的典型一拿出来，一些“差不多”的单位的革命师生，对自己单位的工作重新进行了估价；一些有“差不多”思想的人，对自己的看法发生了怀疑。
    这时，工人宣传队因势利导，又在各班系和科室，普遍举办以深入开展革命大批判和清理阶级队伍为中心内容的毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，工人宣传队的同志组织革命师生反复学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，并且把数学系这个典型作为活教材，引导大家联系本单位阶级斗争的实际和自己的思想状况找出差距，迎头赶上。经过学习，“差不多”的思想克服了，广大革命师生的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争的觉悟大大提高。
    思想认识提高后，广大革命师生积极起来揭发阶级敌人的活动，狠批阶级敌人的反革命罪行，向一小撮阶级敌人发起了猛烈的进攻。这个学校的生物系，一直被称为“三无一红”单位，说它“过去没有右派，现在没有走资派，清理阶级队伍中又没有反动派，是个红彤彤的生物系”。革命师生提高了阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟以后，也很快揭开了这个系的阶级斗争盖子，挖出了藏得既深又久的阶级敌人。历史系的革命师生，原来对于阶级敌人只是一揪、二轰、三不管，现在深入开展了革命大批判，不仅狠批了一小撮阶级敌人的反革命罪行，而且进一步揭露了一小撮阶级敌人暗地里进行破坏活动的罪恶事实。
    在带领广大革命师生向阶级敌人猛烈进攻的斗争中，工人宣传队引导大家把革命大批判和清理阶级队伍紧密结合起来，用革命大批判为清理阶级队伍开路，同时，又把清理阶级队伍中揭发出来的坏人坏事，作为活教材，推动革命大批判的深入开展。这样，互相带动，紧密配合，使全校革命大批判和清理阶级队伍的工作都不断深入发展。整个校园变成了革命大批判的战场，一小撮暗藏的叛徒、特务、反革命分子，一个个被挖了出来。
    活生生的阶级斗争事实，使广大革命师生受到了极为深刻的教育，他们普遍感到，在工人宣传队进校以前，这个学校的工作不是“差不多”，而是“差得远”。许多革命师生在回顾自己思想上从“差不多”到“差得远”这个极大的变化时，更加深刻地认识到，毛主席关于“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导”的伟大指示，对搞好学校的斗、批、改有着极其重要的意义。他们说，事实证明，要认真搞好学校的斗、批、改，必须有工人阶级的坚强领导，单靠我们这些知识分子是不能把教育革命进行到底的。大家决心接受工人阶级的再教育，学习工人阶级的彻底革命精神，改造世界观，在学校的斗、批、改中立新功。
