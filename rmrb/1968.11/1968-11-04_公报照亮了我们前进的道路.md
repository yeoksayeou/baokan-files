The bulletin of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, personally presided over by our great leader Chairman Mao, has been published. The bulletin reflects the demands of the broad masses of the people and points the way to victory for completing the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation on all fronts across the country. We enthusiastically acclaim it, wholeheartedly support it, and resolutely carry it out. We shout a thousand times, ten thousand times: Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live for ten thousand years!

The publication of the bulletin of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. This great historical document is a brilliant summary of the Cultural Revolution over the past two years and a great program for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism." In the course of the struggle, we have deeply come to realize that the struggle between the two command headquarters of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie has always been centered around the issue of political power. On the front lines of "three supports and two militaries," we closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, using Chairman Mao's great theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat to mobilize the masses, arm the masses, and focus on class struggle. We carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism and struggle, fiercely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line advocated by Liu Shaoqi and his agents, seizing back the part of the power they usurped, and achieving one great victory after another. At the critical moment when a handful of class enemies directed their spearheads at the revolutionary committees, attempting to strangle the newly born revolutionary power and restore capitalism, we, together with the broad revolutionary masses, defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and made the revolutionary power increasingly consolidated and developed.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is completely necessary and very timely for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing the restoration of capitalism, and building socialism." The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, personally presided over by Chairman Mao, expelled the criminal Liu Shaoqi, the faithful running dog of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionary Kuomintang, from the Party forever and revoked all his positions inside and outside the Party. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao instructs me to act, Chairman Mao waves his hand and I advance! The bulletin of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee is like a lighthouse shining brightly, illuminating our path forward. We will definitely resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instruction that "the working class must lead everything," and pledge to be a strong backbone of the working class, seriously carrying out the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation. We will definitely remember Chairman Mao's teaching to "never forget class struggle," heighten our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, thoroughly smash the plots of the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and all class enemies, further consolidate national defense, defend the dictatorship of the proletariat, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution!

    六○一一部队　支左爱民模范排
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持召开的党的第八届扩大的第十二次中央全会公报发表了。公报反映了广大人民群众的要求，为全国各个战线上完成斗、批、改任务指明了胜利的方向。我们最热烈地欢呼，最衷心地拥护，最坚决地执行。我们一千遍一万遍地高呼：伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    党的第八届扩大的十二中全会公报的发表，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利。这一伟大历史文件，是两年多来文化大革命的光辉总结，是夺取文化大革命全面胜利的伟大纲领。
    毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命”。在斗争的实践中，我们深刻地认识到，无产阶级和资产阶级两个司令部的斗争，始终是围绕着政权问题进行的。在“三支”“两军”第一线，我们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，用毛主席在无产阶级专政下继续革命的伟大理论，去发动群众，武装群众，狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，狠批刘少奇及其代理人所推行的反革命修正主义路线，夺回了被他们篡夺的那一部分权力，取得了一个又一个的伟大胜利。在一小撮阶级敌人把矛头指向革命委员会，企图扼杀新生的革命政权、复辟资本主义的关键时刻，我们又和广大革命群众一起，保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，使革命政权不断巩固发展。
    毛主席指出：“这次无产阶级文化大革命，对于巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义，是完全必要的，是非常及时的。”毛主席亲自主持的党的第八届扩大的十二中全会，把罪恶累累的帝国主义、现代修正主义、国民党反动派的忠实走狗刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外一切职务，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，这是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。
    毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进！党的第八届扩大的十二中全会公报，象光芒四射的灯塔，照亮了我们前进的道路。我们一定坚决执行毛主席关于“工人阶级必须领导一切”的指示，誓作工人阶级的坚强后盾，认真搞好斗、批、改等各项工作。我们一定牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，百倍提高革命警惕，彻底粉碎美帝、苏修和一切阶级敌人的阴谋活动，进一步巩固国防，保卫无产阶级专政，夺取文化大革命的全面胜利！
