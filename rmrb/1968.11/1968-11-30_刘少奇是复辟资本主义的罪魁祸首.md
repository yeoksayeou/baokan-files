Liu Shaoqi is the Chief Culprit of Attempting to Restore Capitalism

Peng Kunhuang
Poor Peasant of Tianhua Production Brigade, Changsha, Hunan

Before the nation's liberation, our great leader Chairman Mao had clearly pointed out at the Second Plenum of the Seventh Central Committee that China must transform from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country, and from a new democratic society into a socialist society. Chairman Mao said: "The dispersed individual agricultural and handicraft economies, which account for 90% of the national economic output, can and must be cautiously, gradually, and actively guided towards modernization and collectivization. The laissez-faire view is wrong."

Chairman Mao's instructions truly struck a chord with us. We poor and lower-middle peasants have the deepest understanding and follow most closely Chairman Mao's teachings on the path of collectivization. In the winter of 1951, my sister Peng Meixiu was just 20 years old. She followed Chairman Mao's great teaching of "organizing together" and led nine households of poor peasants to form the first mutual aid team in the county. We deeply understand that "only socialism can save China." In the old society, we were trampled underfoot by landlords and tyrants. We are the most loyal to our great leader Chairman Mao and the most resolute in following the socialist path. Whether it was forming mutual aid teams, primary cooperatives, advanced cooperatives, or people's communes, we were always at the forefront of the county. Because we poor and lower-middle peasants firmly took the socialist collectivization path, we quickly changed the face of the poor mountain village of Tianhua. By 1960, the grain yield had nearly doubled compared to the early days of liberation, transforming from a rationing team to a surplus team, becoming a red flag in the county and the province for firmly following the socialist path. "Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." All the achievements of Tianhua are the result of listening to Chairman Mao and following the socialist collectivization path.

However, as Chairman Mao pointed out at the Second Plenum of the Seventh Central Committee, after the nation's liberation, classes, class contradictions, and class struggles still exist within the country. In the countryside, class struggle is prominently manifested in the firm adherence to the socialist path and the opposition to it. The great helmsman Chairman Mao led us poor peasants to resolutely follow the socialist path, aiming to eliminate agricultural capitalist exploitation and achieve agricultural collectivization. Yet, the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi desperately attempted to drag us down the capitalist path. In April 1961, he secretly sneaked into Tianhua with some of his cronies, using "work-study" as a cover to actually promote restoration. The day after he arrived in Tianhua, he hastily convened a brigade cadre meeting, viciously demanding that the cadres expose more "problems." When comrade Peng Meixiu spoke of the great achievements of Tianhua's poor peasants under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, this villain waved his hand impatiently and said, "Don't talk about achievements. Your achievements are all in this big book! Talking about achievements, eight out of ten is enough. Talking about shortcomings, nine out of ten or even more is fine." Look! This old traitor hates our socialist path so much! When he couldn't find any straw in the cadre meeting, he personally invited those who supposedly "had opinions and dared to speak" to solicit "opinions." These people had serious historical problems, were right-opportunists, or were speculators. After getting some "material" from these people, he spread counter-revolutionary propaganda saying, "The red flag of Tianhua is fake, it's just blown up." Thus, he personally wielded the butcher's knife to chop down the red flag of Tianhua. He advocated "dividing fields to teams or labor forces for management," "allocating ridges, wastelands, and gaps to households for cultivation," and "managing forests by household." Under Liu Shaoqi's black directives, a series of capitalist black goods such as "production responsibility system," "segmented contract management," "household management of mountains and forests," "decentralization of collective sideline industries to households," "abolition of basic rations," and "opening of free markets" were thrown out. For a time, the sky above Tianhua was filled with dark clouds. This made Liu Shaoqi, the great traitor, happy. He boasted that only in this way could "overcome egalitarianism and motivate enthusiasm," making everyone have "oil and a future."

Liu Shaoqi, this great traitor, completely miscalculated. He thought he could smoothly promote capitalism in Tianhua, but he encountered the firm opposition of the broad poor peasants from the very beginning. My sister Peng Meixiu, with her loyalty to Chairman Mao, displayed the great courage of "daring to pull the emperor off his horse even if it means being skinned alive." She confronted Liu Shaoqi face to face. She pointed at the traitor Liu and scolded him so fiercely that he was left in a pathetic state. This old traitor, who regarded himself as the "emperor," lost face and made a fool of himself in front of comrade Peng Meixiu, who was armed with Mao Zedong Thought. In a fit of rage and shame, he subjected Peng Meixiu to various forms of cruel persecution, eventually driving her to her death.

In summary, Liu Shaoqi, this old traitor, committed countless evil deeds in Tianhua over 18 days, proving that he is the sworn enemy of us poor peasants.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Opportunists who try to block the tide may exist everywhere, but the tide is unstoppable. Socialism is advancing victoriously everywhere, casting all obstacles behind." The blazing flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution finally reached Liu Shaoqi. The Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee pronounced Liu Shaoqi's political death sentence. The good news spread, and we poor peasants jumped for joy, repeatedly shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" We must inherit and carry forward the fearless revolutionary spirit of comrade Peng Meixiu, fiercely beat down Liu Shaoqi, this fallen dog, and make this chief culprit of attempting to restore capitalism stink for ten thousand years!

    刘少奇是复辟资本主义的罪魁祸首
    湖南长沙天华大队贫农社员　彭昆晃
    早在全国解放的前夕，我们伟大领袖毛主席就在党的七届二中全会上明确地指出了中国由落后的农业国变成先进的工业国，由新民主主义社会转变为社会主义社会的必由之路。毛主席说：“占国民经济总产值百分之九十的分散的个体的农业经济和手工业经济，是可能和必须谨慎地、逐步地而又积极地引导它们向着现代化和集体化的方向发展的，任其自流的观点是错误的。”
    毛主席的指示真是说到了我们的心坎上。我们贫下中农对毛主席关于走集体化道路的教导领会最深刻，跟得最紧。一九五一年冬，我妹妹彭梅秀刚满二十岁，她遵循毛主席“组织起来”的伟大教导，带领我们九户贫下中农，组织了全县第一个互助组。我们深深懂得：“只有社会主义能够救中国”。在旧社会，我们这些人被地主恶霸踩在脚底下。我们对伟大领袖毛主席最忠，走社会主义道路最坚决。无论是成立互助组、初级社、高级社、人民公社，我们都走在全县的最前头。由于我们贫下中农坚定地走社会主义集体化道路，很快改变了天华穷山窝的面貌，一九六○年的粮食产量，比解放初期增长将近一倍，由过去的统销队变成了余粮队，成为全县、全省一面坚持走社会主义道路的红旗。“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”我们天华取得的一切成绩，都是听毛主席的话，走社会主义集体化道路的结果。
    但是，正如毛主席他老人家在党的七届二中全会上指出的，在全国解放后，国内还存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争。在农村，阶级斗争突出地表现在坚决走社会主义道路和反对走社会主义道路上。伟大舵手毛主席带领我们贫下中农坚决走社会主义道路，就是要消灭农村资本主义剥削，实现农业集体化。而叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇却拚死拚活地妄想把我们往资本主义邪道上拉。一九六一年四月，他带着他的一些心腹爪牙偷偷地溜进我们天华，以“蹲点”为名，行复辟之实。他闯进天华的第二天，就急急忙忙地召开大队干部会，恶狠狠地要干部们多揭发些“问题”。当彭梅秀同志讲到天华的贫下中农在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下，取得了巨大成绩时，这个大坏蛋把手一挥，很不耐烦地说：“成绩不要谈了，你们的成绩，这里有这么一大本！成绩十分说八分就行了，缺点八分说九分、十分或更多一些都可以。”看！这个老叛徒对我们走社会主义道路是多么仇恨！当他在干部会上捞不到半根稻草时，就亲自把那些所谓“有意见、敢说话”的人请去征求“意见”。这些人有的历史上有严重问题，有的是右倾机会主义分子，有的是投机倒把分子。他从这些人嘴里得到了一些“材料”后，就大造反革命舆论说：“天华这面红旗是假的，是吹起来的。”于是，他亲自挥动屠刀要砍掉天华这面红旗。他主张“把田分到组或劳动力进行管理”，“田塍、荒土、空坪隙地都可以包给社员去种”，“山林也可以分户管理”。在刘少奇这些黑指示下，什么“产量责任制”，“分段包干”，山林“分户管理”，集体副业“下放到户”，“取消基本口粮”，开放“自由市场”等一系列资本主义黑货都抛了出来。一时间，我们天华的上空乌云密布。这一来，刘少奇这个大叛徒高兴了。他胡说什么，只有这样才能“克服平均主义，有利于调动积极性”，才能使大家“有油水，有奔头”。
    刘少奇这个大叛徒完全打错了算盘。他自以为能在天华畅通无阻地推行资本主义，没料到一开始就遭到了我们广大贫下中农的坚决反对。我妹妹彭梅秀，凭着对毛主席的一片忠心，发扬了“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”的大无畏的英雄气概，同刘少奇进行了面对面的斗争。她指着刘贼义正词严地骂得他狼狈不堪。这个以“皇帝”自居的老叛徒，在用毛泽东思想武装起来的彭梅秀同志面前，丢尽了面子，出尽了洋相。他老羞成怒，对彭梅秀同志多方面进行残酷的迫害，一直到把她逼死。
    总之，刘少奇这个老叛徒在我们天华的十八天，干尽了坏事，证明他是我们贫下中农的死对头。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“想要阻挡潮流的机会主义者虽然几乎到处都有，潮流总是阻挡不住的，社会主义到处都在胜利地前进，把一切绊脚石抛在自己的后头。”无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火，终于烧到了刘少奇的头上。党的八届十二中全会公报宣判了刘少奇的政治死刑。喜讯传来，我们贫下中农高兴得跳了起来，不断地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”我们一定要继承和发扬彭梅秀同志大无畏的革命精神，狠打刘少奇这条落水狗，叫这个复辟资本主义的罪魁祸首遗臭万年！
