A wave of studying and propagating the bulletin of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and implementing the great battle tasks proposed by the plenary session, is surging forward in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Under the leadership of the revolutionary committees at various places, workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, poor and lower-middle herdsmen, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary Red Guards of all nationalities in the whole region are holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the content of studying the bulletin. They are summing up their work by comparing it with the bulletin and are determined to accomplish the tasks of each stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation proposed by Chairman Mao, and to win a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The Revolutionary Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region recently held an expanded meeting to seriously study the instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, the speech of Vice Chairman Lin, and the bulletin of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. The participants, with great revolutionary indignation, denounced the treasonous crimes of the traitor, spy, and scab Siu Ming-Chih and his accomplices. The meeting, according to the great battle calls issued by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, made a comprehensive arrangement for the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in the whole region.

After the publication of the bulletin of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the revolutionary committees of Huhhot, Baotou, and the alliances of Hulunbuir, Xilingol, Ulanqab, and Ejin in Inner Mongolia, as well as the standing committee members of the revolutionary committees of various banners and counties, led the staff of the revolutionary committees to form propaganda teams and go deep into the grassroots to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They studied the bulletin sentence by sentence with the poor and lower-middle peasants and herdsmen of all nationalities to implement the various battle tasks proposed by the plenary session. The members and staff of the Ulanqab Alliance Revolutionary Committee, together with the soldiers of the local garrison of the People's Liberation Army, formed a propaganda team and, braving the cold wind and snow, went deep into the pastoral areas to deliver the bulletin translated into Mongolian to every yurt scattered on the grasslands. When the herdsmen of all nationalities received the bulletin of the plenary session, they repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" "Resolutely overthrow the traitor, spy, and scab Siu Ming-Chih!" They said that the bulletin expressed the feelings of the poor and lower-middle herdsmen. Expelling Siu Ming-Chih, this big bad guy, from the Party forever is indeed a great thing, which has removed a big disaster for us poor people. In the past few days, six banners, including Zalaite and Chenbaerhu, in the Hulunbuir Alliance have sent more than 270 propaganda teams to the countryside and pastoral areas to propagate the bulletin of the plenary session and have held more than 300 study classes. The Dalainor Commune of this alliance, according to the characteristics of nomadic herding, held 48 study classes with the production brigade as the unit. The commune members who participated in the study classes, after studying the bulletin, further enhanced their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and were determined to thoroughly criticize and expose the great traitor Siu Ming-Chih and his agents in Inner Mongolia, so that they would never be able to rise again.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is completely necessary and very timely for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist restoration, and building socialism." In the Mao Zedong Thought study classes held in various places, the revolutionary masses of all nationalities, with Chairman Mao's latest instruction as the guideline, linked the actual struggle of the cultural revolution, studied the bulletin, and deepened their understanding of the great significance of the cultural revolution. At present, the revolutionary masses of all nationalities in the whole region, under the inspiration of the spirit of the bulletin of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, are launching a new upsurge of revolutionary criticism and struggle, criticism, and transformation, determined to follow Chairman Mao bravely forward and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

　　内蒙古自治区各级革委会领导成员组成宣传队深入基层
　　大办学习班落实公报提出的各项战斗任务
    新华社呼和浩特十一日电　一个学习、宣传党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报，落实全会提出的各项伟大战斗任务的热潮，正在内蒙古自治区蓬勃发展。全区各族工人、贫下中农、贫下中牧、革命干部和革命的红卫兵，在各地革命委员会领导下，纷纷举办以学习公报为内容的毛泽东思想学习班，对照公报，总结工作，决心实现毛主席提出的关于斗、批、改各个阶段的任务，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    内蒙古自治区革命委员会最近举行了扩大会议，认真学习了伟大领袖毛主席的指示、林副主席的讲话和党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报。与会的同志，怀着极大的革命义愤，声讨了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其同伙的叛党叛国的滔天罪行。会议根据党的八届十二中全会发出的各项伟大战斗号召，对全区斗、批、改的各项任务进行了全面安排。
    党的八届十二中全会公报发表后，内蒙古呼伦贝尔盟、锡林郭勒盟、乌兰察布盟、伊克昭盟、呼和浩特、包头等盟、市革委会以及各旗、县革委会的常委委员们，都带领革委会工作人员，组成宣传队，深入基层，举办毛泽东思想学习班，同各族贫下中农、贫下中牧一起，逐条逐句地学习公报，落实全会提出的各项战斗任务。乌兰察布盟革委会委员和工作人员同人民解放军当地驻军指战员组成的宣传队，冒着寒风飞雪，深入牧区，把译成蒙古文的全会公报，送到散布在草原上的每个蒙古包。各族贫下中牧得到全会公报时，不断高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”
  “坚决打倒叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇！”他们说，公报说出了我们贫下中牧的心里话，把刘少奇这个大坏蛋永远开除出党，这实在是件大好事，为我们穷人除了一个大祸根。呼伦贝尔盟的扎赉特、陈巴尔虎等六个旗，近几天已有二百七十多个宣传队到农村、牧区宣传全会公报，并举办了三百多个学习班。这个盟的达赉诺尔公社，根据游牧特点，以浩特（生产作业组）为单位，举办了四十八个学习班，参加学习的社员，学了公报，阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟进一步提高，决心要把大叛徒刘少奇及其在内蒙古的代理人彻底批倒批臭，叫他们永世不得翻身。
    毛主席教导我们：“这次无产阶级文化大革命，对于巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义，是完全必要的，是非常及时的。”各地举办的毛泽东思想学习班里，各族革命群众以毛主席的这一最新指示为纲，联系文化大革命的斗争实际，学习公报，加深了对文化大革命伟大意义的理解。目前，全区各族革命群众，正在党的八届十二中全会公报精神鼓舞下，掀起一个革命大批判和斗、批、改的新高潮，决心紧跟毛主席奋勇前进，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
