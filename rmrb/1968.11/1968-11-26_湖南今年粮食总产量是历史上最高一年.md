Following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, the masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the countryside of Hunan Province have waged a year-long arduous struggle in the midst of the great proletarian cultural revolution and have won another bumper harvest. This year, the total grain production in the province is the highest in history. Approximately one-fourth of the communes and production brigades in the province have achieved the grain production targets set by the "Outline for Agricultural Development in China."

The excellent situation in Hunan's agricultural production this year is a fruit of the great proletarian cultural revolution, a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

All-round bumper harvests are a notable feature of Hunan's agricultural production this year. Grain, cotton, tea, fruit, mulberry, tobacco, sugar, medicine, and various other crops, as well as forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, all have seen bumper harvests and all-round development. From the foot of the Wuling Mountains to the shores of Dongting Lake, from the revolutionary base areas in eastern Hunan to the Miao and Dong villages in western Hunan, everywhere is filled with revolutionary fervor, production is booming, and a prosperous scene of bumper harvests is presented.

The rapid development of commune and brigade enterprises is another notable feature of Hunan's agricultural production this year. Over the past year, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, following Chairman Mao's brilliant "May 7th Directive," have thoroughly criticized the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agent in Hunan, Wang Yunchun, for their heinous crimes of promoting "three freedoms and one contract," dissolving the collective economy, and slashing commune and brigade enterprises throughout the province. They have fully mobilized the strength of the collective economy of the people's communes, self-reliant and hardworking, and have established many commune and brigade enterprises, further developing and strengthening the collective economy, and more fully demonstrating the great power of the people's communes' "large and public" characteristics.

Agricultural technological innovation and technological revolution have opened up a new situation, which is the third notable feature of Hunan's agricultural production this year. The Dongfeng-20 type mechanized rice transplanting machine, researched and developed mainly by workers, has undergone more than a thousand repeated tests and finally been officially put into production this year. Chemical weeding of rice has been successfully applied on a large scale in 400,000 mu of rice fields across the province. The great achievements of technological innovation and technological revolution have powerfully promoted the development of agricultural production.

This year, Hunan's agricultural production has not been smooth sailing; it has been carried out in the midst of struggles against natural disasters and class enemies. This year, areas such as Lingling, Hengyang, Xiangtan, Yueyang, Changsha, and Zhuzhou have suffered from unprecedented floods, and some areas have experienced droughts and severe pest infestations. Especially since last winter, a handful of class enemies have caused varying degrees of difficulties in agricultural production in various places through their interference and sabotage.

However, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the countryside throughout the province, tempered and tested by more than two years of the cultural revolution, have been inspired and encouraged by the great situation of the great proletarian cultural revolution under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. With high morale and great enthusiasm, they have taken Dazhai as an example, with deep proletarian feelings of love for the great leader Chairman Mao, followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and bravely and tenaciously fought against class enemies and various natural disasters, finally winning this year's bumper harvest in agricultural production.

The mass movement of "Learning from Dazhai in Agriculture" has been widely and deeply carried out in the countryside of Hunan, greatly promoting the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, speeding up the thought revolution of the people, and greatly carrying forward the communist spirit of loving the country and the collective, the spirit of hard work and self-reliance. In the disaster-stricken areas this year, many communes and production brigades have put forward the bold words of "three no's (no state relief money, grain, or materials) and four no less (total production not less, procurement not less, collective accumulation not less, distribution to members not less)." Learning from the people of Dazhai, following the path of Dazhai, and creating the achievements of Dazhai have become a prevailing trend.

    紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署主动向阶级敌人和各种自然灾害展开英勇斗争
    湖南今年粮食总产量是历史上最高一年
    全省约有四分之一社队的粮食产量，实现了《全国农业发展纲要》规定的指标
    新华社长沙二十五日电　湖南省广大贫下中农和农村革命干部，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指引下，在轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命中，经过一年来的艰苦奋战，夺得了农业生产的又一个丰收年。今年全省粮食总产量是历史上最高的一年。全省约有四分之一的社队的粮食产量，实现了《全国农业发展纲要》规定的指标。
    湖南省今年农业生产蒸蒸日上的大好形势，是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。
    项项丰收，全面丰收，这是今年湖南省农业生产的显著特色之一。粮、棉、茶、果、桑、烟、糖、药、杂和林、牧、副、渔，样样丰收，全面发展。从五岭山下到洞庭湖畔，从湘东革命老根据地到湘西苗寨侗乡，到处革命热气腾腾，生产蒸蒸日上，呈现一派欣欣向荣的丰收景象。
    人民公社社队企业蓬勃发展，是今年湖南省农业生产的又一显著特色。一年来，广大贫下中农遵照毛主席光辉的“五·七”指示，狠批了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其在湖南代理人王延春之流在全省农村推行“三自一包”、瓦解集体经济、大砍社队企业的滔天罪行，充分发挥人民公社集体经济的力量，自力更生、艰苦奋斗，兴办了许多社队企业，进一步发展壮大了集体经济，更加显示了人民公社“一大二公”的巨大威力。
    农业技术革新和技术革命开创了新局面，是今年湖南省农业生产的第三个显著特色。以工人为主研究创制的东风—（20）型机动水稻插秧机，经过一千多次反复试验，终于在今年正式定型投产。水稻化学除草，已在全省四十万亩水田大面积施药成功。技术革新和技术革命的巨大成就，有力地促进了农业生产的发展。
    今年，湖南省农业生产并不是一帆风顺的，是在与天斗、与地斗、与阶级敌人激烈搏斗中进行的。今年零陵、衡阳、湘潭、岳阳、长沙、株洲等地曾遭受了历史上少见的洪水危害，部分地区曾一度出现旱情和较重的虫害。尤其是从去冬以来，一小撮阶级敌人的干扰和破坏，给今年各地的农业生产带来了不同程度的困难。
    但是，经过两年多文化大革命锻炼和考验的全省广大贫下中农和农村革命干部，在毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，在无产阶级文化大革命大好形势的激励和鼓舞下，斗志昂扬，意气风发，以大寨为榜样，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的深厚无产阶级感情，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，主动向阶级敌人和各种自然灾害展开了英勇顽强的搏斗，终于夺取了今年农业生产的丰收。
    “农业学大寨”的群众运动在湖南农村空前广泛深入的开展，极大地促进了活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，大大加速了人的思想革命化，爱国家、爱集体的共产主义风格，艰苦奋斗、自力更生的精神，大大发扬。今年受灾地区的不少社队，提出了“三不要（不要国家救济钱、粮、物），四不少（总产量不少、征购不少、集体积累不少、社员分配不少）”的豪言壮语。学大寨人，走大寨路，创大寨业，已蔚然成风。
