Japanese fishermen hold sea demonstration against U.S. military cargo ship carrying ammunition

NEW YORK, Nov. 4 (Xinhua) - According to the Eastern News Agency, more than 100 fishermen from Hiroshima Prefecture took to the sea in their fishing boats on November 4 to demonstrate in the restricted area off the coast of Kure, protesting the unloading of ammunition from the U.S. military ammunition transport ship "Newcastle Victory."

The fishermen of Kure have long been resisting the suppression of fishermen by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and strongly oppose the restriction of fishing due to the unloading of ammunition for the U.S. military's Yellow Flag ammunition depot.

That morning, the fishermen drove 80 fishing boats into the sea area restricted by the U.S. military and demonstrated near the "Newcastle Victory," a U.S. military transport ship anchored there. They shouted slogans such as "U.S. military ammunition transport ships, get out of Japan" and "Remove the U.S. military ammunition depot," and then began fishing around the two piers where the U.S. military ammunition was unloaded to show their protest. The barges loaded with ammunition were forced to stop, and the U.S. military was unable to unload the ammunition.

LONDON, Nov. 3 (Xinhua) - About 100 people held an all-night demonstration here on November 3 to protest against a British monopolistic capital electronics company manufacturing air force equipment for the U.S. imperialist war of aggression in Vietnam.

The demonstrators surrounded the office building of the company located in the center of London and condemned the company for signing a contract with the U.S. Department of Defense to provide equipment for the U.S. imperialist's murderous aircraft bombing Vietnam.

Despite the threats from London authorities who sent out police, the crowd persisted in the demonstration in the cold night.

Spanish students bravely hold strike, resolutely fight against Franco's fascist regime

MADRID, Nov. 5 (Xinhua) - Students of Madrid University, despite the brutal suppression by the reactionary authorities, have been persistently fighting against the fascist rule of the Franco regime in Spain.

The brutal rule of the Franco dictatorship has aroused great indignation among the Spanish people.

This year, Spanish workers and students have repeatedly gone on strike, held rallies, and marched to protest against Franco's fascist rule.

On October 31, about 2,000 students of Madrid University held a protest meeting at the Law School and marched through the city, shouting slogans against the Franco fascist regime along the way.

The reactionary authorities sent out police and mounted police to suppress the demonstration and occupied Madrid University with a large number of police. They also expelled two student representatives without reason.

The brutal suppression by the Spanish reactionary authorities has aroused even greater anger among the students of Madrid. For a week, they have bravely faced fully armed police and persisted in their struggle.

On November 4, despite the threats from a large number of police, the students of Madrid University held another protest meeting at the Political Science College to condemn the government's suppression of the student movement and oppose the police occupation of the university. They posted numerous slogans in the campus to express their indignation against the fascist authorities. Some of the slogans condemned "the brutality of capitalism," while others read: "The university is ours - police get out."

Thousands of Greeks hold massive demonstration, shout down U.S.-backed military government

ATHENS, Nov. 4 (Xinhua) - In Athens, the capital of Greece, thousands of people held a massive demonstration on November 3 to protest against the U.S.-backed Greek fascist military dictatorship.

The demonstrators shouted slogans such as "Down with the fascists!" and "Down with the military government!" as they marched through the city center.

The reactionary authorities hastily sent out a large number of police to suppress the demonstration and blocked several streets. The demonstrators broke through the police blockade and fought back with bricks and stones. About 40 people were illegally arrested.

The Greek fascist military dictatorship came to power in April 1967 with the support of U.S. bayonets and has been implementing reactionary domestic and foreign policies ever since, increasingly facing strong opposition from the people.
