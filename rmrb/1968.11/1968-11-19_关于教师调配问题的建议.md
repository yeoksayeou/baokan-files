	Our school is located in the suburbs of Beijing. Many of the teachers live in the city. Regarding the future of these teachers, there are different opinions in our discussions. Some suggest moving to the border areas to participate in supporting the border work; others suggest returning to the city to engage in educational work. We suggest: Teachers who live in the city should be encouraged to settle down in production brigades that lack teachers. The living problems should be solved by the brigade according to its economic conditions. This approach not only benefits the collective but also helps with the ideological transformation of the teachers.

	If teachers return to the brigade for work, there will be situations where some brigades have too many teachers while others have too few or none. For brigades with many teachers, some suggest adopting a rotating teaching method; others suggest, except for retaining the necessary teachers, sending the rest to production brigades to engage in productive labor. We believe that both methods are not very appropriate. Teachers are a valuable asset in the cause of socialist construction. The transfer of public primary schools to brigades does not mean the dissolution of the teaching staff. Except for a few bad elements who should be handed over to the brigade for supervision and reform through labor, the majority of teachers should continue to teach as much as possible. We suggest: The revolutionary committee at the county level should be responsible for the allocation of teachers in the county, with the principle that teachers should return to the production brigades as much as possible.

　　关于教师调配问题的建议
    一，我们驻地的学校在北京市郊区，家住市里的教员较多。对于这些教师的去向，在座谈讨论中有不同的意见，有的主张迁到边疆，去参加支边工作；有的主张回城市从事教育工作。我们建议：家在城市的教师，应动员本人到缺少师资的生产队安家落户，生活问题由所在大队根据本大队的经济条件合理解决。这样做不但对集体有好处，也有利于教师的思想革命化。
    二，教师回大队工作就会出现这种情况：有的大队教师多了，有的大队就不够或没有。对于教师多的大队，有人主张采取轮换教学的办法；有人主张除留下需要的教师外，其余的全部下放生产队参加生产劳动。我们认为，这两种办法都不大妥当。教师是社会主义建设事业中的一笔宝贵财产，公办小学下放到大队来办，并不等于解散教师队伍，除混进教师队伍中的少数坏人应交大队监督劳动改造外，大多数教师仍应尽可能继续任教。我们建议：由县一级的革命委员会统一负责本县教师的分配工作，原则是教师尽量回生产大队。
