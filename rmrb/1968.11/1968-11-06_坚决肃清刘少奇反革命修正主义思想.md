The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, expanded, unanimously decided to expel the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever and to remove him from all his positions within and outside the Party. This wise decision fully represents the fundamental interests of the working class and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants across the country, reflecting the wishes and demands of hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses. We support this decision a thousand times over, ten thousand times over!

Over the past nineteen years since the founding of the nation, the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in the countryside has been extremely sharp and complex. Our great leader Chairman Mao led the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in carrying out land reform, organizing mutual aid teams, developing cooperatives, establishing people's communes, and walking the broad path of socialism and communism. However, in every period, there has always been a rightist or ultra-"left" (actually rightist) force that stubbornly interfered with Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. A handful of class enemies did their utmost to sabotage land reform, ruthlessly dismantle cooperatives, and crazily advocate for "three freedoms and one contract" and "four freedoms," attempting to lead us poor and lower-middle peasants astray. Where does this root come from? Through this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have truly seen clearly that the culprit is the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi. We hate this number one capitalist-roader in the Party to the core. He is a criminal who is deeply implicated with imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionary Kuomintang, and he is our sworn enemy. The decision of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee to expel him from the Party forever is truly a great relief!

The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee calls on us to continue to deeply carry out the revolutionary criticism and repudiation, to eliminate the counter-revolutionary revisionist thought of Liu Shaoqi and other major capitalist-roaders within the Party. We poor and lower-middle peasants enthusiastically support this and will resolutely carry it out. To uproot the weeds, one must dig out the roots. Today, we have pulled Liu Shaoqi down from his horse, but if we do not further carry out the revolutionary criticism and repudiation, thoroughly criticize and expose his counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and completely eliminate its poisonous influence, capitalism will still have the danger of restoration. We poor and lower-middle peasants are determined to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, implement each of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, take class struggle as the key link, use revolutionary criticism and repudiation as the driving force, earnestly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, thoroughly destroy the ideological and social foundations of Liu Shaoqi's restoration of capitalism, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    坚决肃清刘少奇反革命修正主义思想
    湖北省革委会副主任、全国农业劳动模范　饶兴礼
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会一致决议，把埋藏在党内的叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外的一切职务。这个英明决定完全代表了全国工人阶级和广大贫下中农的根本利益，反映了亿万革命群众的愿望和要求。我们一千个拥护，一万个拥护！
    建国十九年来，我国农村两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争十分尖锐、复杂。我们的伟大领袖毛主席领导广大贫下中农搞土地改革，组织互助组，发展合作化，建立人民公社，走社会主义、共产主义的康庄大道。可是，在每一个时期，总是有一股右的或极“左”即形“左”实右的势力，顽固地干扰毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。一小撮阶级敌人竭力破坏土地改革，拚命大砍合作社，疯狂鼓吹“三自一包”、“四大自由”，妄图把我们贫下中农引到邪路上去。这个根子在那里？经过这次无产阶级文化大革命，我们真正看清楚了，罪魁祸首就是叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇。我们恨透了这个党内头号走资派，他是罪恶累累的帝国主义、现代修正主义和国民党反动派的走狗，是我们贫下中农的死对头。党的八届扩大的十二中全会决定把他永远开除出党，真是大快人心！
    党的八届十二中全会号召我们，继续深入展开革命大批判，肃清刘少奇等党内最大的一小撮走资派的反革命修正主义的思想，我们贫下中农热烈拥护，坚决照办。铲草必须刨根。今天，我们把刘少奇拉下了马，如果不进一步开展革命大批判，把他推行的反革命修正主义路线批深批透，彻底肃清其流毒，资本主义就仍然有复辟的危险。我们贫下中农决心紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，落实毛主席每一项最新指示，以阶级斗争为纲，以革命大批判为动力，认真搞好斗、批、改，彻底摧毁刘少奇复辟资本主义的思想基础和社会基础，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
