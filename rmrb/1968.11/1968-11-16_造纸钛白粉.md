	Workers at the Second Chemical Factory in Jining, Shandong, have successfully developed paper grade titanium dioxide, a crucial chemical raw material for producing high-quality paper for printing Chairman Mao's works, thus contributing to the production of more and better paper for this purpose.

	Previously, all the paper grade titanium dioxide needed in China was imported. After learning about this situation, the revolutionary workers of the Second Chemical Factory decided to follow Chairman Mao's directive of "self-reliance" and produce the material themselves. Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they had already started struggling against the capitalist roaders within the factory and began the trial production. After the revolutionary committee was established during the Cultural Revolution, the trial production was provided with extremely favorable conditions. The factory revolutionary committee decided at a meeting to fully mobilize the leading role of the working class, to rally all positive factors, and to produce paper grade titanium dioxide as quickly as possible to express their loyalty to Chairman Mao. During the trial production, all the revolutionary workers in the factory contributed their ideas and efforts wherever needed. After arduous struggles, they overcame one difficulty after another and finally succeeded in producing paper grade titanium dioxide.

    造纸钛白粉
    山东济宁市第二化工厂的革命职工试制成功了生产高级用纸不可缺少的化工原料——造纸钛白粉，为生产更多更好的印制毛主席著作的用纸作出了贡献。
    过去，我国需要的造纸钛白粉完全依靠进口。济宁第二化工厂的革命职工了解到这种情况后，决心遵照毛主席的“自力更生”的教导，自己制造造纸钛白粉。他们在无产阶级文化大革命以前，就同厂里的走资派进行斗争，开始了试制工作。文化大革命中厂革命委员会成立以后，给试制工作带来了极为有利的条件。厂革委会在一次会议上就作出决定：充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，调动一切积极因素，尽快生产出造纸钛白粉，向毛主席敬献忠心。在试制过程中，全厂革命职工人人献计献策，那里需要，就战斗在那里。经过艰苦奋战，突破了一个又一个难关，终于把造纸钛白粉试制成功了。
