In the midst of the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee has been issued! We, the revolutionary artists of the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe, firmly support the resolutions of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, firmly support the expulsion of the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi from the Party, and resolutely respond to the great battle call of the communiqué. We will continue to deepen the revolutionary criticism and thoroughly settle accounts with the counter-revolutionary crimes of the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, Liu Shaoqi and his gang, and eliminate their poisonous influence in the literary and artistic circles.

For a long time, the great traitor, great spy, and great capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices have been promoting a counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the literary and artistic circles, opposing the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao. They oppose literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serving proletarian politics. They peddle all sorts of black goods such as the "closed-door reform" theory, the "special status of actors" theory, and the "going down to get gilded" theory, using every means to oppose and obstruct artists from integrating with the workers, peasants, and soldiers. They attempt to lead artists down the path of revisionism.

"The Closed-Door Reform" Theory: A Black Theory Denying Integration with Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers

Our great leader Chairman Mao clearly pointed out in his speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art: "Our literary and artistic workers must complete this task, must shift their standpoint, must, in the process of integrating with the workers, peasants, and soldiers and in the process of actual struggle, gradually shift to the side of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to the side of the proletariat." Revolutionary literary and artistic workers must engage in the three great revolutionary practices of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, integrate with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and thoroughly transform their worldview, truly shifting their standpoint to the side of the proletariat.

However, Liu Shaoqi, Peng Zhen, Zhou Yang, and the like, in a maddened frenzy, opposed Chairman Mao's directive and spread a set of "closed-door reform" fallacies. Liu Shaoqi, with ulterior motives, vigorously advocated that "writers and artists must specialize, must delve deep, must have knowledge in various fields, must study history, must study literature, must study foreign languages, must engage in artistic cultivation..." The counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Zhen also strongly opposed actors integrating with the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers, shouting that "one can just look at picture books to rehearse a play." Zhou Yang further propagated that "in modern conditions, talented and realistic writers and artists can, through their creative paths and life practices, advance towards a progressive worldview." The representatives of the literary and artistic black line in our troupe, following Liu Shaoqi's black directives, also peddled these black goods within the troupe. They encouraged actors to study classical literature, read classical poetry, promoted actors to paint and practice calligraphy, and wanted actors to spend all day in their rooms, reading books, painting, and pondering deeply about their roles. They also spread the revisionist fallacies of "having art is having everything," "one unique skill, eat anywhere," and even locked actors in rooms to write role autobiographies. An actor playing a villainous role wrote eight role autobiographies but none were approved. This is the "closed-door reform" path designed by Liu Shaoqi and his gang.

The "closed-door reform" theory originates from Liu Shaoqi's black "Cultivation." Its essence is to guide literary and artistic workers to detach from proletarian politics, detach from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and detach from labor, staying in high-rise buildings and ancient courtyards to "cultivate," resulting in becoming more and more revisionist, gradually turning into their docile tools for subverting proletarian dictatorship and restoring capitalism. Their so-called "artists must specialize, must delve deep, must have knowledge in various fields" actually means to specialize and delve deep into feudalism, capitalism, and revisionist art. Their so-called "advancing towards a progressive worldview through creative paths and life practices" actually means advancing towards a bourgeois worldview.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Correct ideas can only come from social practice, only from the three practices of production struggle, class struggle, and scientific experiment." The proletarian worldview can only be established in the process of participating in the three great revolutionary practices, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, engaging in self-criticism and criticizing revisionism, and eliminating non-proletarian thoughts. Revolutionary literary and artistic workers can only shift their standpoint to the side of the proletariat in the process of integrating with actual struggles. If they do not integrate with the workers, peasants, and soldiers and engage in "closed-door reform," in their own "creative paths and life practices" to "specialize" and "delve deep," the result will only be to move further away from the proletarian worldview and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and closer to the quagmire of revisionism.

"The Special Status of Actors" Theory: An Excuse to Oppose Integration with Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers

The great traitor, great spy, and great capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi and his gang, to oppose and obstruct literary and artistic workers from integrating with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, also created a "special status of actors" theory. The counter-revolutionary two-faced Ertao said, "The lives of writers and actors, including transportation conditions and living places... should be better under possible conditions. They should not participate in too much physical labor, or not participate at all, because performing itself is a kind of intense physical labor." The counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Zhen even ordered, "Do not go down in the spring, as the rural wind is strong and can damage the voice; do not go down in the winter as there is nothing to do and it is cold; it is good to go in the summer to exercise the body and practice the voice, and it is also good to imitate the movements of farmers, preferably in places near the city..." and so on. Although the tones are different, the purpose is the same: to emphasize the special status of actors, that actors are different from others, that actors do not need to integrate with life, do not need to approach the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and even more do not need to live, eat, and work with the workers, peasants, and soldiers to transform their thoughts.

This "special status of actors" theory can only cultivate a special stratum and spiritual aristocracy, only fostering the erroneous idea of "everything is inferior, only art is superior." This "special status of actors" theory also opened the door for the counter-revolutionary revisionists, reactionary academic "authorities," and ghosts and snakes in the theatrical circles. The capitalist-roaders and reactionary academic "authorities" in our troupe are faithful executors of this black theory. Wherever the troupe goes to perform, they first look at how they are received, always emphasizing "special treatment." A reactionary "authority" performing for the PLA unit was sloppy and not serious, and even said that the soldiers did not understand art. Another reactionary "authority" put on a big show, saying, "We actors are not simple, we are watched by thousands, seen by tens of thousands," thinking of themselves as "superior to others." Some even arrogantly boasted that they were "national treasures." These people were so arrogant because their reactionary bourgeois worldview had not been transformed, and it was also related to the promotion and protection of the "special status of actors" theory and the literary and artistic black line.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "People's work is different, their positions are different, but no matter how high the position, one must appear as an ordinary laborer among the people. It is absolutely not allowed to put on airs." We, the proletarian revolutionary artists, are servants of the people, ordinary laborers, and students of the masses. Being an actor is just a different division of revolutionary work. However, the counter-revolutionary revisionists Liu Shaoqi, Tao Zhu, Peng Zhen, and the like, frantically advocated the "special status of actors" theory. The so-called "special status of actors" is essentially a reflection of exploitative class thoughts. "Those who work with their brains rule, those who work with their hands are ruled" and "actors are superior to others" are the core of this black theory. Liu Shaoqi and his gang use "special status" as a banner to corrupt and disintegrate the literary and artistic teams, attempting to keep us forever in theaters and rehearsal halls, long-term detached from labor, detached from the masses, and detached from revolutionary practice, gradually turning into a special stratum, comfortably degenerating and changing quality, to prepare conditions for them to restore capitalism in China. This is a very poisonous and treacherous move. We must thoroughly expose and criticize the "special status of actors" theory, along with its promoters, and sweep them all into the garbage heap of history.

"The Going Down to Get Gilded" Theory: A Euphemism for Fake Integration with Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "If you want the masses to understand you, if you want to integrate with the masses, you must make a decision and undergo long-term, even painful, tempering." Revolutionary literary and artistic workers must put down their airs, humbly accept the re-education of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and truly transform their old thoughts.

Liu Shaoqi and his gang, however, vigorously advocated the "going down to get gilded" theory, saying that some literary and artistic workers "cannot go down, their bodies are not good, and they will get sick if they go down. One can think of a way, or specially prepare a few cars, set up beds and stoves on them, and live in those cars. All places with roads can be reached." "Going down to reform, one can also have the idea of getting gilded." This is a trick of changing the beam while claiming to change the rafters. On the surface, it seems to "integrate" with life, but in essence, it is still completely detached from the workers, peasants, and soldiers. This reactionary fallacy exactly meets the needs of those reactionary "authorities" who refuse to transform their thoughts but want to gain political capital. They use Liu Shaoqi and Zhou Yang's so-called "integrating with life" as a means to seek fame and fortune. A counter-revolutionary revisionist in our troupe, under the guidance of this fallacy, went to a factory to "labor." He demanded a single room, a sofa, and a steel bed in the factory, and even went back home by car after three days of work. In name, it was "integrating with life," but in reality, it was using the factory to rehearse plays, not even a cursory visit. A reactionary "authority" went to the countryside to "labor," holding an umbrella against the sun, wearing sunglasses, and being assisted by someone. The poor and lower-middle peasants saw his appearance and were very angry. Another reactionary "authority," to gain political capital, once "joined the army." In the company, she threw a handful of snow on herself to take a photo, and held a shovel in an empty pot to take a photo, completely pretending and posing. The old Beijing Municipal Committee even published these photos in newspapers, greatly propagating and "gilding" her face.

The "going down to get gilded" theory, in essence, is to use the method of gilding to wrap bourgeois thoughts. It is externally bright but internally dirty, creating an illusion, externally beautiful but internally filthy. Liu Shaoqi and Zhou Yang's gang vigorously peddled this fallacy precisely to cover up a group of bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities" and bourgeois artists, creating public opinion for them to restore capitalism, and when the time is ripe, carry out a counter-revolutionary restoration. Their intentions are sinister and extremely vicious!

Our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, led revolutionary artists to forge ahead, fighting through thorns and thistles, and resolutely fought against a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the former Propaganda Department, former Cultural Department, and former Beijing Municipal Committee and their backer Liu Shaoqi. In the most arduous and intense days of the struggle, Comrade Jiang Qing personally gave the revolutionary artists of our troupe the red revolutionary treasure book—radiant with glory—"Selected Works of Mao Zedong." The red treasure book, like a million rays of light, illuminated our path forward and guided us to forge ahead. After many rounds of struggle and countless days and nights, the revolutionary modern Peking opera "Sha Jianhu" finally came into being under the personal cultivation of Comrade Jiang Qing. When "Sha Jianhu" was initially rehearsed, Comrade Jiang Qing instructed us to integrate with the workers, peasants, and soldiers and learn their excellent qualities and fine traditions. According to Comrade Jiang Qing's instructions, we went to the army and factories to integrate with life, receiving great education and tempering.

Throughout the entire creation and rehearsal process of "Sha Jianhu," we deeply felt: to perform revolutionary plays, one must first be a revolutionary. All revolutionary warriors of the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe are determined to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, go to the fiery struggles, and go to the only broad and rich source, humbly accepting the re-education of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Under the leadership of the working class, we will thoroughly eliminate the poisonous influence of fallacies such as "closed-door reform," "special status of actors," and "going down to get gilded," seriously practice the basic skills of integrating with the workers, peasants, and soldiers and the basic skills of techniques, create and perform more and better revolutionary model plays, and strive to build our troupe into a truly proletarianized, militarized revolutionary model troupe!

    狠批刘少奇一伙反对文艺工作者与工农兵相结合的谬论
    首都工人、解放军驻北京京剧团毛泽东思想宣传队  北京京剧团革命委员会
    在无产阶级文化大革命取得节节胜利的凯歌声中，党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表了！我们北京京剧团的全体革命文艺战士，坚决拥护党的八届扩大的十二中全会的决议，坚决拥护把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党，坚决响应公报的伟大战斗号召，继续深入展开革命大批判，彻底清算党内头号走资派刘少奇一伙的反革命罪行，肃清他们在文艺界所散布的流毒。
    长期以来，大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇及其同伙，在文艺界推行了一条反革命修正主义的文艺黑线，和毛主席的革命文艺路线相对抗。他们反对文艺为工农兵服务，为无产阶级政治服务，大肆兜售什么“闭门改造”论、“演员特殊”论、“下去镀金”论等黑货，千方百计地反对和阻止文艺工作者与工农兵相结合，妄图把文艺工作者引向修正主义的歧途。
    “闭门改造”论是否定与工农兵结合的黑理论
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话中明确地指出：“我们的文艺工作者一定要完成这个任务，一定要把立足点移过来，一定要在深入工农兵群众、深入实际斗争的过程中，在学习马克思主义和学习社会的过程中，逐渐地移过来，移到工农兵这方面来，移到无产阶级这方面来。”革命的文艺工作者只有投身于阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命实践，与工农兵相结合，才能彻底改造世界观，真正把立足点移到无产阶级这方面来。
    可是，刘少奇、彭真、周扬之流，却丧心病狂地反对毛主席的这一指示，散布了一套“闭门改造”的谬论。刘少奇心怀叵测地大肆鼓吹“文学家、艺术家要专、要深，要有各方面的知识，要学历史，要学文学，要学外文，要进行艺术修养……”。反革命修正主义分子彭真也竭力反对演员深入工农兵生活，叫嚣什么“要排戏看看小人书就行了”。周扬则进一步宣扬什么“在现代的条件下，有才能的，忠实于现实的作家、艺术家，有可能通过自己的创作道路和生活实践走向先进的世界观。”文艺黑线在我团的代理人秉承刘少奇的黑旨意，在团内也大肆贩卖这些黑货。他们鼓励演员学古文、看古诗，提倡演员绘画、练字，要演员们整天坐在房子里，看书画画，苦思冥想地钻研角色。他们还大肆散布“有了艺术就有一切”，“一招鲜，吃遍天”等修正主义的谬论，甚至把演员关在房子里写角色自传。有一个演反面人物的演员，连写了八篇角色自传都没有通过。这就是刘少奇一伙所设计的“闭门改造”的“道路”。
    “闭门改造”论来源于刘少奇的黑《修养》。它的要害就是引导文艺工作者脱离无产阶级政治，脱离工农兵群众，脱离劳动，呆在高楼大厦和古宅庭院里进行“修养”，结果是越养越修，逐步成为他们颠覆无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义的驯服工具。他们所谓的“艺术家要专、要深，要有各方面的知识”，实际上就是对封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的艺术要专，要深。他们所谓的“通过创作道路和生活实践”“走向先进的世界观”，实际上就是走向资产阶级的世界观。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“人的正确思想，只能从社会实践中来，只能从社会的生产斗争、阶级斗争和科学实验这三项实践中来。”无产阶级的世界观，只有在参与三大革命实践的过程中，以毛泽东思想为武器，进行斗私批修，清除掉身上的非无产阶级思想，才能树立起来。革命的文艺工作者，只有在深入实际斗争的过程中，才能把自己的立足点移到无产阶级这方面来。如果不与工农兵结合，“闭门改造”，在自己的“创作道路和生活实践”中去“专”去“深”，结果只能是离无产阶级世界观越远，离毛主席的革命路线越远，而离修正主义的泥坑却越来越近。
    “演员特殊”论是反对与工农兵结合的借口
    大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇及其同伙，为了反对和阻止文艺工作者走与工农兵相结合的道路，还制造了一种“演员特殊”论。反革命两面派陶铸胡说什么“作家、演员的生活，包括交通条件，住的地方……，在可能条件下，要好一些。也不要过多的参加体力劳动，或者就不参加，因为演出本身就是一种相当强度的体力劳动了”。“女演员不要参加什么体力劳动，劳动多了，腰也粗了，手也硬了，还演什么好看的舞蹈身段？”反革命修正主义分子彭真甚至下令“春天不要下去，农村风大，容易吹坏嗓子；冬天冷没什么活干，也可以不下去；夏天空气好，去锻炼锻炼身体，喊喊嗓子还不错，也可以模仿模仿农民的动作，最好是离城近的地方……”，如此等等。这种种说法，腔调虽然不同，但目的就是一个，那就是强调演员特殊，演员与众不同，演员不必去深入生活，不必去接近工农兵，更不必去与工农兵群众实行同吃、同住、同劳动，从而改造自己的思想。
    这种“演员特殊”论，只能培养出一批高高在上的特殊阶层和精神贵族，只能助长那种“万般皆下品，唯有艺术高”等错误思想。这种“演员特殊”论，也给戏剧界的反革命修正主义分子，反动学术“权威”，牛鬼蛇神大开了方便之门。我团的走资派和反动学术“权威”，就是这种黑理论的忠实执行者。剧团到那里去演出，首先要看人家招待的如何，处处讲究“特殊”。有一个反动“权威”给解放军部队演出时，吊儿郎当，极不认真，还胡说战士不懂艺术。另一个反动“权威”也大摆臭架子，说什么“我们演员可不简单，千人瞧，万人看”，把自己看成是“高人一等”。甚至还有人狂妄地吹嘘自己是“国宝”。这些人之所以如此猖狂，是由于他们反动的资产阶级世界观没有改造的结果，同时和文艺黑线提倡的“演员特殊”论以及对他们的吹捧和包庇也极有关系。
    毛主席教导我们：“人们的工作有所不同，职务有所不同，但是任何人不论官有多大，在人民中间都要以一个普通劳动者的姿态出现。决不许可摆架子。”我们无产阶级革命文艺战士，是人民的勤务员，是普通的劳动者，是群众的小学生，当演员是革命的分工不同。而反革命修正主义分子刘少奇、陶铸、彭真之流却拚命地鼓吹“演员特殊”论。所谓“演员特殊”，实质上是一种剥削阶级思想的反映。“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”“演员高人一等”就是这种黑理论的核心。刘少奇一伙就是以“特殊”为招牌，来腐蚀和瓦解文艺队伍，妄图把我们永远关在戏院和排练厅里，长期脱离劳动、脱离群众、脱离革命斗争实践，逐渐变为特殊阶层，舒舒服服地蜕化变质，以便为他们在中国复辟资本主义准备条件。这是非常毒辣和阴险的一招。我们一定要把“演员特殊”论，连同这种谬论的鼓吹者揭深批臭，统统扫入历史的垃圾堆里去。
    “下去镀金”论是与工农兵假结合的代名词
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“你要群众了解你，你要和群众打成一片，就得下决心，经过长期的甚至是痛苦的磨练。”革命的文艺工作者，必须放下臭架子，脚踏实地地和工农兵相结合，虚心接受工农兵的再教育，才能彻底改变旧思想。
    刘少奇一伙却竭力鼓吹“下去镀金”论，胡说什么文艺工作者“有些人是下不去，身体也不大好，下去他就生病。可以想点办法，或者专门搞几部汽车，那上面架起铺来，架起灶来，就住在那个汽车上，所有有公路的地方都可以去。”“下去改造，也可以有镀金的想法”。这是一个偷梁换柱的花招。从表面上看，也下去“深入”生活了，但实质上还是完全游离于工农兵群众之上。这种反动的谬论，正符合那些拒绝思想改造而又要捞取政治资本的反动“权威”的需要，他们把刘少奇、周扬的所谓“深入生活”当成了猎取名利的手段。我团的一个反革命修正主义分子，就是在这种谬论指导下去工厂“劳动”的，他到工厂里要住单间、坐沙发、睡钢丝床，而且去三天要坐汽车回家两天。名义上是“深入生活”，实际上是借工厂排戏，连走马观花都谈不到。有一个反动“权威”到农村去“劳动”时，打着旱伞，戴着墨镜，还有人搀着。贫下中农看到他那副样子，都非常气愤。还有一个反动“权威”，为了捞取政治资本，她曾经“下部队当兵”。在连队里，她抓把雪扔在身上，要照个像，拿着铲子在空锅里搅几下也要照个像，完全是装腔作势，摆样子。旧北京市委还在报纸上刊载这些照片，大肆宣扬，给她脸上“贴金”。
    “下去镀金”论，其实质是用镀金的方法，把资产阶级思想包起来。外光内黑，制造假象，外表很漂亮，里面却是脏东西。刘少奇、周扬一伙之所以大力贩卖这种谬论，就是为了把一批资产阶级反动学术“权威”、资产阶级艺术家都包庇下来，为他们复辟资本主义制造舆论，待到时机成熟，便实行反革命复辟。真是用心叵测，狠毒至极！
    我们敬爱的江青同志，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，率领革命文艺战士，披荆斩棘，向旧中宣部、旧文化部、旧北京市委一小撮反革命修正主义分子和他们的总后台刘少奇进行了坚决的斗争。在斗争最艰苦、最激烈的日子里，江青同志把红彤彤的革命宝书——光芒四射的《毛泽东选集》亲自赠给我团的革命文艺战士。红色宝书象万道霞光照亮了我们前进的道路，指引着我们奋勇前进。经过了多少个斗争的回合，熬过了多少个日日夜夜，江青同志亲自培育的革命现代京剧《沙家浜》终于诞生了。当《沙家浜》初步排出后，江青同志就指示我们要深入工农兵，学习工农兵的优秀品质和优良传统。我们根据江青同志的指示，分别到部队和工厂深入生活，受到了极大的教育和锻炼。
    在《沙家浜》的整个创作和排练过程中，使我们深深体会到：要演革命戏，先做革命人。我们北京京剧团的全体革命战士，决心遵照毛主席的教导，到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去，到唯一的最广大最丰富的源泉中去，虚心接受工农兵的再教育。在工人阶级的领导下，彻底肃清“闭门改造”、“演员特殊”、“下去镀金”等谬论的流毒，认真练好与工农兵相结合的基本功和技术的基本功，创作和演出更多更好的革命样板戏，为把我团建设成为一个真正无产阶级化的、战斗化的革命样板团而努力！
