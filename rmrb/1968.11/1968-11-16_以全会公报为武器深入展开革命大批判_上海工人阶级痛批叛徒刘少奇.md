Revolutionary criticism promotes industrial production to advance with more solid steps. All revolutionary workers in the city are full of fighting spirit and determined to complete and overfulfill the annual national production plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 15th - The communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee has greatly mobilized the enthusiasm of Shanghai workers to seize the revolution and promote production. They use the communiqué as a weapon to severely expose and criticize the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes of betraying the party and the country, turning hatred into strength, and promoting industrial production to advance with more solid steps.

Currently, revolutionary workers in various factories in Shanghai are fighting with a high fighting spirit in the last more than forty days of the year, determined to present their loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao with actual actions of completing and overfulfilling the annual national production plan.

The heroic Shanghai working class, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, has achieved great merits in "seizing the revolution and promoting production" and made due contributions to the socialist motherland. Since this year, inspiring good news has been continuously coming from the industrial and transportation front. Metallurgy, machinery, textiles, chemicals, instruments, light industry, handicrafts, and other industries have created new outstanding achievements in production in the situation of dispatching a large number of excellent workers to participate in the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams. Many factories have completed this year's production plan ahead of schedule after the publication of the communiqué of the Twelfth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee.

The decision of the Twelfth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee to expel the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi from the party forever and to remove all his positions inside and outside the party has greatly boosted the morale of the proletarian revolutionary faction. Revolutionary workers in Shanghai, with deep hatred for Liu Shaoqi, have launched a massive wave of denunciation of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary crimes. Many factories have held on-site criticism meetings, linking the traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist roaders in their units with Liu Shaoqi for criticism, thoroughly settling the accounts of the heinous crimes of this handful of class enemies. In this revolutionary criticism, the revolutionary enthusiasm and creative abilities of the workers have been greatly unleashed. Some factories have quickly removed the "difficult to manage" label, and revolution and production have taken on a new look. Many factories have innovated equipment and created new production records. Some factories, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," have successfully developed a batch of important new products.

Before the Cultural Revolution, the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi had poisoned the people in the Minhang area of Shanghai three times. After the publication of the communiqué of the Twelfth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the revolutionary workers in this area immediately launched a wave of denunciation of Liu Shaoqi's crimes. They angrily pointed out that Liu Shaoqi is the sworn enemy of the working class, a sinful servant of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionary Kuomintang. Workers of the Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory said, following Chairman Mao's teachings, in 1958, we independently designed and manufactured a type of the most advanced generator in the world. But this bad guy Liu Shaoqi was extremely hostile to this great creation of Chinese workers. Facing this generator, he shamelessly said, "Is it real or fake?" He truly showed the appearance of a complete slave! After the criticism, the broad masses of workers, with greater revolutionary enthusiasm, quickly launched a new high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

Recently, the workers of the No. 3 Steel Plant concentrated on criticizing the traitor Liu Shaoqi's "crawling philosophy" and "slave philosophy," further breaking through the old rules and foreign frameworks set by the bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities," and successfully completed the overhaul of the open-hearth furnace in a short time. On the day of the publication of the communiqué, they poured out the first batch of high-quality molten steel. On the same day, the workers severely criticized Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods such as "expert management of factories." Workers of the Shanghai Tool Factory severely criticized Liu Shaoqi's "slave philosophy" and quickly successfully developed a new type of ultra-high precision planing and grinding machine with world-advanced level.

Under the great encouragement of the communiqué, the Shanghai working class has fully played its leading role in the Cultural Revolution and all work, continuing to organize a large number of worker investigation teams. They conducted extensive investigations and research on some unreasonable systems and regulations in factories, thereby raising the struggle, criticism, and transformation of factories to a new level. Now, 80% of the factories and enterprises on the Shanghai industrial and transportation front have implemented streamlining and efficiency, and 70% to 80% of the cadres and technical personnel have been sent to the production front line to fight shoulder to shoulder with the workers. The Shanghai Handicrafts Bureau and other industrial bureaus have also organized many "worker promotion teams" to go deep into the factories, publicize Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the spirit of the communiqué, mobilize the masses, and boost morale, helping some factories to achieve production leaps.

　　以全会公报为武器深入展开革命大批判
　　上海工人阶级痛批叛徒刘少奇
    革命大批判推动工业生产以更坚实的步伐向前跃进，全市广大革命工人斗志昂扬，决心完成和超额完成全年国家生产计划
    新华社上海十五日电　党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报极大地调动了上海工人阶级抓革命、促生产的积极性。他们以公报为武器，狠揭猛批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇叛党叛国的滔天罪行，将仇恨化为力量，推动工业生产以更坚实的步伐向前跃进。
    当前，上海各工厂的广大革命工人正以昂扬的战斗姿态，奋战年前最后四十多天，决心以完成和超额完成全年国家生产计划的实际行动，向伟大领袖毛主席敬献忠心。
    英雄的上海工人阶级，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在“抓革命，促生产”中立下了丰功伟绩，为社会主义祖国作出了应有的贡献。今年以来，振奋人心的大喜讯不断从工交战线传出。冶金、机电、纺织、化工、仪表、轻工、手工等各个行业，在抽调大批优秀工人参加工人毛泽东思想宣传队的情况下，都在生产上创造了新的优异成绩，并且试制成功了大批重要新产品。党的十二中全会公报发表后，又有一大批工厂提前完成了今年全年的生产计划。
    党的十二中全会决定把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外一切职务，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气。上海广大革命职工怀着对刘少奇的刻骨仇恨，掀起了声势浩大的声讨刘少奇反革命罪行的热潮。许多工厂纷纷举行现场批判会，把本单位的叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派和刘少奇挂起钩来进行批判，彻底清算这一小撮阶级敌人的滔天罪行。在这场革命大批判中，工人群众的革命积极性和创造才能得到极大发挥。有些工厂迅速摘掉了“老大难”帽子，革命和生产出现了新的面貌。许多工厂革新了设备，创造了新的生产纪录。有些厂以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，试制成功了一批重要新产品。
    在无产阶级文化大革命以前，叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇曾经三次到上海闵行地区放毒。党的十二中全会公报发表后，这个地区的广大革命职工立即掀起了声讨刘少奇罪行的热潮。他们愤怒地指出，刘少奇是工人阶级不共戴天的死敌，是罪恶累累的帝国主义、现代修正主义和国民党反动派的走狗。上海电机厂工人说，我们遵循毛主席的教导，在一九五八年，自行设计、自行制造成功了国际上一种最先进的发电机。可是刘少奇这个坏家伙对中国工人的这一伟大创造非常仇视，面对这台发电机，竟睁着眼睛胡说什么“是真的还是假的”，真是一副十足的奴才相！广大工人群众通过批判以后，以更大的革命干劲，迅速掀起了斗、批、改的新高潮。
    上钢三厂的工人群众最近集中批判了大叛徒刘少奇的“爬行哲学”和“洋奴哲学”，进一步破除了资产阶级反动技术“权威”所设置的旧条条、洋框框，用很短的时间胜利地完成了平炉大修任务，并且在全会公报发表的大喜日子放出了第一炉优质钢水。在平炉放出第一炉钢水的当天，工人们又狠批了刘少奇推行的“专家治厂”等反革命修正主义黑货。上海工具厂的工人狠批了刘少奇的“洋奴哲学”，很快试制成功了具有世界先进水平的超高精度新型铲磨机。
    在全会公报的巨大鼓舞下，上海工人阶级充分发挥在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用，继续组织起大批工人调查组，对工厂里的一些不合理的体制和规章制度，展开了广泛调查研究，从而把工厂的斗、批、改提高到一个新的水平。现在，上海工交战线已有百分之八十的工厂企业实行了精兵简政，百分之七十到八十的干部和技术人员已下放到生产第一线，同工人并肩战斗。上海手工业局和其他工业局，还组织了许多“工人促进队”，深入工厂，宣传毛主席最新指示和全会公报精神，发动群众、大鼓干劲，帮助一些厂实现了生产的跃进。
