	The essence of the working people cannot change
	Li Zengzeng, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Da Wu Brigade, Da Wu Public Commune, Ping Shan County, Hebei

Liu Shaoqi, this criminal who is a lackey of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionary Kuomintang, in order to restore capitalism in China, spreads the poison of the bourgeois "self" everywhere, and desperately instills the corrupt philosophy of seeking official positions and wealth in party members. He openly advocates: "As long as he truly has the ability... there will be an important position for him. The party will promote him." This is a self-portrait of Liu Shaoqi's corrupt soul, which pursues official positions and wealth.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "A Communist Party member should be open-hearted, honest, active, and regard revolutionary interests as his first life, and subordinate personal interests to revolutionary interests." For a revolutionary, joining the party is not for seeking official positions and wealth, but for wholeheartedly serving the people. If a person always pursues fame and profit, dreaming of being "promoted" to an "important position," he is absolutely not a true Communist Party member, but a thoroughgoing egoist. A Communist Party member armed with Mao Zedong Thought should think, speak, and act for the people and for the revolution.

I am a Communist Party member from a poor peasant background. Since I was eight years old, I was forced to work for the landlord and suffered endless oppression and bullying. With the thunderous roar of spring, the Communist Party came to save us, and this poor child was finally liberated. After liberation, under the nurturing of the great thought of Mao Zedong, my political awareness continuously improved. Poor and lower-middle peasants trusted me and elected me as a cadre. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, revolutionary masses elected me as the chairman of the brigade revolutionary committee. This is the trust and encouragement of the party and revolutionary masses. Our power is completely given by the masses. I can only follow Chairman Mao's teachings to "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people, to hold and use power well for the poor and lower-middle peasants, so as not to disappoint the expectations and entrustment of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

To hold and use power well for the poor and lower-middle peasants, one must maintain the essence of an ordinary laborer and never leave the poor and lower-middle peasants. Therefore, after becoming the chairman of the brigade revolutionary committee, I have always insisted on participating in collective production labor, tempering myself in labor, and making my thoughts continuously revolutionary. Usually, no matter how late the meetings are at night, I still go to the fields to work with the commune members the next morning; if I miss a morning's labor, I feel like something is missing, and I am not in good spirits. If I have to go out for meetings, I do not go home first but go directly to the fields to work with the commune members, even if it is just for a short time to hoe a ridge or push a cart of manure. For example, once the county revolutionary committee held a Mao Zedong Thought study class for middle school teachers at Huishe Middle School, asking me to introduce the situation of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions in our brigade. I ran thirteen miles to the school at noon. As a result, due to changes in the schedule of the study class, the introduction time was postponed. At that time, the weather was very hot, and I was indeed very tired. The comrades in the study class advised me to rest a bit, but I thought that even a little time should be utilized, otherwise, it would not be "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people. So, I immediately returned to the production team, and the afternoon labor was not missed at all. Because I often work with the commune members, I have established close ties with the masses. The masses are willing to talk to me about anything, allowing me to timely understand the masses' active thoughts and new trends in class struggle, so that many problems can be solved in time. Poor and lower-middle peasants say that although I have become an "official," the essence of the working people has not changed. This shows that Chairman Mao's teaching that "cadres should maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the laboring people through participating in collective production labor" is extremely wise. Liu Shaoqi's "theory of joining the party to become an official" is an attempt to lead us into the quagmire of revisionism. If we follow Liu Shaoqi's logic of joining the party for "position" and "becoming an official," will we not become a group of opportunists who pursue official positions and wealth? Will we not become officials who sit on top of the people?

Liu Shaoqi advocates the "theory of joining the party to become an official," attempting to use the bourgeois worldview to transform our party, creating conditions for his usurpation of the party, the military, and the government, and the restoration of capitalism. However, his arrogant attempt will never succeed! We must use the invincible thought of Mao Zedong to criticize and expose the traitor Liu Shaoqi's "theory of joining the party to become an official." We must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings on wholeheartedly serving the people and forever maintain the essence of the working people.

　　劳动人民的本色不能变
　　河北平山县大吾公社近掌大队革委会主任　李增增
    刘少奇这个罪恶累累的帝国主义、现代修正主义和国民党反动派的走狗，为在中国复辟资本主义，到处散布资产阶级“私”字的毒菌，拚命向党员灌输升官发财的腐朽哲学。他公然宣扬：“只要他真有本领……会有重要地位给他的。党会提拔他的。”这是刘少奇一心追求升官发财的腐朽灵魂的自我写照。
    毛主席教导我们：“一个共产党员，应该是襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益”。对于一个革命者来说，加入党决不是为了升官发财，而是为了全心全意地为人民服务。如果一个人整天追求名利，梦寐以求“提拔”他到“重要地位”，那他绝对不是一个真正的共产党员，而是一个十足的利己主义者。用毛泽东思想武装起来的共产党员想的、说的、干的，都应该是为人民，为革命。
    我是一个贫农出身的共产党员。我从八岁就被迫给地主干活，受尽地主的压迫欺凌。春雷一声震天响，来了救星共产党，我这个苦孩子才翻身得解放。解放后，我在伟大的毛泽东思想哺育下，政治觉悟不断提高，贫下中农信任我，选我当干部。在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，革命群众又选我当大队革委会主任。这是党和革命群众对我的信任和鞭策。我们的权力，完全是人民群众给的。我只有按照毛主席“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的教导，为贫下中农掌好权，用好权，才能不辜负贫下中农对我的期望和委托。
    要为贫下中农掌好权，用好权，就必须保持普通劳动者的本色，一刻也不脱离贫下中农。所以，我在担任大队革委会主任以后，始终坚持参加集体生产劳动，在劳动中磨练自己，促使自己的思想不断革命化。平时，不管晚上开会多么晚，我第二天早晨都照样和社员一起下地劳动；如果耽误一早晨劳动，心里就觉得缺个什么东西，浑身不得劲。有事到外边开会回来，我不是先到家里，而是直接到地里和社员一块劳动，那怕是只有锄一垄地、推一车粪的时间都利用起来。如有一次县革委会在回舍中学举办中学教师毛泽东思想学习班，让我去介绍一下我们大队落实毛主席最新指示的情况。我就在中午跑了十三里地到了学校，结果因学习班时间安排有变化，推迟了介绍时间。当时天气很热，我也确实很累，学习班的同志们劝我休息一下，但是我想，有一点时间也要利用起来，不然就不是“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务。于是，我就立即返回了生产队，下午的劳动一点也没有误。由于我经常和社员一起劳动，和群众建立了密切的联系，群众有什么话都愿意和我讲，使我及时了解了群众的活思想和阶级斗争的新动向，使许多问题能够及时得到解决。贫下中农说我虽然当了“官”，但劳动人民的本色没有变。这说明，毛主席要我们“干部通过参加集体生产劳动，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系”的教导，是非常英明的。刘少奇的“入党做官论”，是妄图把我们引向修正主义的泥坑里去。如果按照刘少奇入党是为了“地位”、“做官”的混账逻辑去做，我们共产党员岂不成了一批一心追求升官发财的投机分子了吗？岂不成了骑在人民头上的官老爷了吗？
    刘少奇鼓吹“入党做官论”，就是妄图用资产阶级世界观改造我们的党，为他篡党篡政篡军、复辟资本主义创造条件。但是，他的这种狂妄企图是永远不会得逞的！我们一定要用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，批倒批臭大叛徒刘少奇的“入党做官论”。我们一定要牢记毛主席关于全心全意地为人民服务的教导，永远保持劳动人民的本色。
