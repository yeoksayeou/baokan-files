Inspired by the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Twelfth Central Committee, a wave of revolutionary criticism to thoroughly settle accounts with the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi is surging across cities and countryside in Heilongjiang Province.

Recently, the Provincial Revolutionary Committee held two televised and wired broadcast denunciation meetings against the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi. From the banks of the Mudan River to the shores of the Heilong River, from the Songnen Plain to the southern and northern parts of the Xiaoxing'anling Mountains, revolutionary masses across the province listened to the live broadcast of the criticism meetings. They set up battlefields for revolutionary criticism in courtyards, workshops, counters, and classrooms, angrily denouncing the heinous crimes of the great traitor Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices in betraying the Party and the nation.

The workers of Heilongjiang Province, who are infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, are at the forefront of the revolutionary criticism. At a denunciation meeting held in the Harbin Vehicle Factory, many veteran workers angrily criticized the counter-revolutionary crimes of the great capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi in betraying the working class. The workers angrily pointed out that the great traitor Liu Shaoqi is a wicked lackey of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and is our working class's sworn enemy. Workers at the Harbin Electric Machinery Factory have been setting up battlefields in workshops and teams for days, thoroughly settling accounts with the Party's top capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi, who, under the guise of "inspection," came to this factory twice a few years ago to spread poison. Miners in the coal cities of Shuangyashan, Jixi, and Hegang used the communiqué as a weapon to thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the coal mines who promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist goods of "extinguishing class struggle" and "material incentives." They dragged the capitalist-roaders to the pithead and down into the pits for on-site criticism, thoroughly smashing the revisionist line of managing enterprises and abolishing numerous bonus systems, pushing forward the in-depth development of struggle, criticism, and transformation in the mining areas.

In the Yichun forest area, from the logging sites deep in the forest to the machine-roaring workshops, the flames of revolutionary criticism are burning everywhere. In 1961, Liu Shaoqi, together with his agents in Heilongjiang Province, sneaked into the forest area and spread his poison. Workers at the criticism meetings pointed out: Liu Shaoqi, this scoundrel, in the forest area, vigorously advocated "profit," "cheap," and "worth it," rambling on about "reducing quotas to stimulate the production of small logs," "earning more wages for small logs," and so on. His evil purpose was to try to turn Yichun into a base for his capitalist restoration. He wanted to give us some "money" and seize our power, which is a foolish dream. We forestry workers have Mao Zedong Thought, and we will not fall for his tricks. We care about the power, and we work for the revolution.

Inspired by the communiqué, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the rural areas of Heilongjiang Province fiercely criticized the top capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi's fallacies of "self-reliance, mutual aid, and collective ownership" and "four freedoms," thoroughly exposing and criticizing his advocacy for the development of a rich peasant economy and his boast that "even if there are 10,000 rich peasants in Northeast China, we are not afraid." National agricultural labor model and director of the Revolutionary Committee of Taiping Brigade, Zhongxing Commune, Gannan County, Lü He, said at a brigade-level criticism meeting: "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we poor and lower-middle peasants resisted the evil winds of 'long-term protection of the rich peasant economy' and 'four freedoms' advocated by Liu Shaoqi, turning this originally barren mountain valley into a thriving socialist new countryside. The wolf-hearted Liu Shaoqi wants us to take the capitalist road, which is absolutely impossible." The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xiqin Brigade, Xiqin Commune, Shuangcheng County, set up battlefields in every household, angrily criticizing the top capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi's attempt to restore capitalism in the countryside. They said: In 1955, our great leader Chairman Mao, in his brilliant work "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization," highly praised the experience of our Xiqin Village at that time in carrying out the agricultural cooperativization movement, combining leadership and the voluntary participation of the masses, conducting comprehensive planning, and developing cooperatives. He summarized it as "comprehensive planning, strengthening leadership," eight golden words shining with light, as an important guideline for the agricultural cooperativization movement across the country at that time. However, the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Heilongjiang Province strongly opposed Chairman Mao's great guideline, attempting to restore capitalism, which is a crime deserving a thousand deaths. The members of various ethnic groups in the Heihe region, located at the forefront of anti-revisionism in the motherland, held criticism meetings time and again, angrily denouncing the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices for betraying the Party and the nation. The members of the Ewenki ethnic group, located deep in the forests of the Xiaoxing'anling Mountains, used the communiqué as a weapon to denounce Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of "extinguishing class struggle" and "exploitation is meritorious" through a comparison of old and new societies. They said: The great traitor Liu Shaoqi wants to restore capitalism and force us back into the deep mountains and old forests to suffer twice, which is absolutely impossible.

The surging revolutionary criticism tide in urban and rural areas of Heilongjiang Province has powerfully promoted the rapid development of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

　　以全会公报为武器　城乡到处摆战场
　　黑龙江省广大群众彻底清算刘少奇的滔天罪行
    据新华社哈尔滨十六日电　在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的鼓舞下，一个向叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇进行总清算的革命大批判高潮，正在黑龙江省城乡各地蓬勃兴起。
    最近，省革命委员会连续召开两次声讨叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的电视、有线广播大会。从牡丹江畔到黑龙江之滨，从松嫩平原到小兴安岭南北，全省广大革命群众收听了批判大会的实况广播，并且在场院、车间、柜台、教室摆下革命大批判的战场，愤怒声讨大叛徒刘少奇及其同伙叛党叛国的滔天罪行。
    无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的黑龙江省工人阶级，走在革命大批判的最前列。在哈尔滨车辆厂召开的声讨大会上，许多老工人愤怒地批判了大工贼刘少奇出卖工人阶级的反革命罪行。工人们愤怒地指出，大叛徒刘少奇是一个罪恶累累的帝国主义、现代修正主义和国民党反动派的走狗，是我们工人阶级不共戴天的敌人。哈尔滨电机厂的工人，连日来在车间、班组摆开战场，彻底清算党内头号走资派刘少奇前几年以“视察”为名，两次跑到这个工厂放毒的罪行。煤城双鸭山、鸡西、鹤岗的矿工，以公报为武器，彻底批判刘少奇及其在煤矿的代理人所推行的“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义黑货。他们把走资派揪到井口，带到井下，进行现场批判，大破了修正主义办企业路线，破除了名目繁多的奖金制度，推动了矿区斗、批、改的深入开展。
    在伊春林区，从密林深处的伐木场到机器轰鸣的车间，到处燃起了革命大批判的烈火。一九六一年，刘少奇伙同他在黑龙江省的代理人，窜到林区，大放其毒。工人们在批判会上指出：刘少奇这个坏蛋，在林区时，大肆鼓吹“利润”、“便宜”、“合算”，胡说什么“要降低定额，刺激小木头生产”，“搞小木头多开工资”等等，他的罪恶目的，就是企图把伊春搞成他复辟资本主义的基地。他想给我们一点“钱”，妄图夺我们的大权，这是痴心妄想。我们林业工人有了毛泽东思想，决不上他的当，我们关心的是政权，是为了革命干活。
    黑龙江省农村的广大贫下中农，在公报的鼓舞下，狠批党内头号走资派刘少奇的“三自一包”、“四大自由”的谬论，彻底揭露和批判了他的发展“三马一犁一车”的富农经济、“东北有一万名富农党员也不怕”的狂吠。全国农业劳动模范、甘南县中兴公社太平大队革委会主任吕和，在大队召开的批判会上说：“在毛主席的领导下，我们贫下中农顶住了刘少奇鼓吹的‘长期保护富农经济’、‘四大自由’的邪风，使我们这个原来是荒山秃岭的穷山沟，变成了欣欣向荣的社会主义新农村。黑心狼刘少奇妄想叫我们走资本主义道路，是万万办不到的。”双城县希勤公社希勤大队的贫下中农，家家户户摆战场，愤怒批判党内头号走资派刘少奇妄图在农村复辟资本主义的罪行。他们说：一九五五年，我们伟大领袖毛主席在《关于农业合作化问题》这篇光辉著作里，对我们希勤村那时在开展农业合作化运动中，采取领导和群众自愿相结合，进行全面规划，发展合作社的经验，给了很高的评价，把它概括为“全面规划，加强领导”八个金光闪闪的大字，作为指导当时全国农业合作化运动的重要方针。可是，叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其在黑龙江省的代理人却百般反对毛主席的这一伟大方针，妄图搞资本主义，真是罪该万死。地处祖国反修前哨的黑河地区各族社员，一次又一次召开批判大会，愤怒声讨叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其同伙叛党叛国的罪行。位于小兴安岭密林深处的鄂伦春族社员，通过新旧社会的对比，以公报为武器，痛斥刘少奇散布的“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“剥削有功”等反革命修正主义谬论。他们说：大叛徒刘少奇妄想复辟资本主义，想把我们再次逼进深山老林受二遍苦，这是永远办不到的。
    黑龙江广大城乡出现的汹涌澎湃的革命大批判洪流，有力地推动着斗、批、改的迅猛发展。
