Tuan Mountain Primary School in Xizhuang People's Commune, Jinzhai County, Anhui Province, is located at the peak of Tuan Mountain in the revolutionary old base area of Dabie Mountains. This is a people-run primary school established by nine poor peasants in Tuan Mountain Production Brigade. Over the past eighteen years, the school has followed Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, developed steadily amidst the fierce struggle between the two classes and two lines, and become increasingly successful. The poor and lower-middle peasants love this school from the bottom of their hearts. They say: "The school we run ourselves is good. It cultivates new sprouts with Mao Zedong Thought in every aspect. With such successors, the socialist state will definitely be secure."

	Transformation

Tuan Mountain Production Brigade has a total of 114 households. Before liberation, except for six landlord and two rich peasant households who had children attending school, the 103 poor and lower-middle peasant households had been illiterate for generations. In 1950, with the support of the land reform team, Fang Linwang and eight other poor peasants used a ancestral hall to establish Tuan Mountain People-Run Primary School. Thirteen children from poor and lower-middle peasant families entered the school for the first time. Over the eighteen years, the poor and lower-middle peasants built the school with their own hands, expanding the school buildings twelve times. Now, it has developed into a complete primary school with three teachers teaching three combined classes, and an attached junior high school class with 72 students. The entire brigade has had 201 students enroll, accounting for more than 40% of the total population. All the children of poor and lower-middle peasants who can attend school have received education. Now, they can even study in junior high school without leaving the brigade.

Over the eighteen years, the nine poor peasants led the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to emphasize proletarian politics, using Mao Zedong Thought to educate the students of Tuan Mountain Primary School. These students, coming from and returning to the poor and lower-middle peasants, have grown into "laborers with socialist consciousness and culture" through the three great revolutionary movements in the countryside. The son of a poor peasant, Pan Qixin, was a five-good student in school, became a five-good team member after returning to the production team, and joined the People's Liberation Army to become a five-good soldier. There are 54 people who have been evaluated by the masses as active elements in the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought and five-good team members.

What kind of tree blooms what kind of flower, what kind of flower bears what kind of fruit. Over the eighteen years, the students cultivated by Tuan Mountain People-Run Primary School, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, have changed the face of the mountain valley. Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Tuan Mountain Production Brigade has presented a lively and moving scene: every brigade has a column for revolutionary criticism, every village has a Mao Zedong Thought broadcasting station, every household has the Red Book, and the red sun illuminates the deep mountain valley. In the past, this place had barren mountains, poor land, and a shortage of food. Now, the poor mountain valley has become a granary, and surplus grain and bamboo are sold to the state every year.

	Struggle

"Once the landlord power in the countryside is overthrown, the cultural movement of the peasants begins." The poor and lower-middle peasants of Tuan Mountain Production Brigade, as Chairman Mao pointed out as early as 1927, urgently demanded the establishment of their own schools after land reform. In the winter of 1950, Fang Linwang, Pan Zhongming, Pan Yunmou, and eight other poor peasants braved the wind and snow, crossed mountains and valleys, and went door to door to mobilize the children of poor and lower-middle peasants to attend school. At that time, their enthusiasm for running the school was immense. They traveled tens of miles to invite teachers, used earth bricks to build desks and benches, and thus established a primary school for the poor and lower-middle peasants.

The sound of reading filled the mountain valley. The poor and lower-middle peasants were delighted; the class enemies hated it so much that they gnashed their teeth and said, "It has always been the rich who read books, and the poor who raise pigs. I've never seen peasants running a school, and poor kids want to study, I'll make sure your tail doesn't grow long!" The nine poor peasants with deep bitterness and hatred in their hearts knew: if the cultural power is not seized, political power is hard to maintain, and the root of bitterness cannot be uprooted! They used two bloody grudges in their village for propaganda and education. One was: In 1944, the pseudo-baojian Li Shuhua, in order to catch the illiterate poor peasant Peng Chuanbing as a soldier, sent him to deliver a letter to the pseudo-town government. The letter read: "The sender is a soldier from my bao, Peng Chuanbing, to be detained when he arrives." Peng Chuanbing only realized he was tricked when he was tied up with five ropes. Another was: In 1946, the evil landlord Zhang Tao had the peasant Huang Congfa deliver a letter to the pseudo-town government, which stated: "The traitor Huang Congfa, to be arrested when he arrives." The illiterate Huang Congfa was tricked and captured, and was brutally killed the next day. The class bitterness enlightened everyone's eyes, and the broad masses of peasants who had risen up unanimously expressed: This cultural power, we poor and lower-middle peasants must seize it and hold it! This school, we will definitely run it! The more the landlords and rich peasants oppose us, the more we must run it! They sent their children to school in droves. The poor and lower-middle peasants also elected Fang Linwang and eight other poor peasants to form the school management committee, taking control of all school affairs. The school was located in an old ancestral hall, too remote, and inconvenient for children to attend. Some poor peasants gave up their thatched houses and cow sheds. With the development of production, the poor and lower-middle peasants built kilns to burn bricks, contributed labor and materials, and built school buildings through self-reliance. The poor peasant Li Yuansheng had no children attending school, but he always volunteered for labor and contributed materials. He happily told others: "The school is run by us poor and lower-middle peasants, cultivating successors for the poor and lower-middle peasants. Although I have no children attending school, I also have the responsibility to run the school."

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Tuan Mountain Production Brigade, represented by the nine poor peasants, not only fought against class enemies, natural disasters, and the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line advocated by Liu Shaoqi in the process of running the school. This struggle was equally sharp and intense, mainly reflected in the attitude towards the people-run school. At that time, Liu Shaoqi's agent in Anhui discriminated against and persecuted the people-run school in every possible way. A small group of capitalist roaders within the old county committee "embraced the public-run and kicked the people-run," adopting an attitude of non-recognition towards Tuan Mountain Primary School. One year, Jinzhai County held a competition for advanced schools. Tuan Mountain Production Brigade also reported their own Tuan Mountain Primary School, listing many examples of the school's service to the poor and lower-middle peasants. However, the old county committee's capitalist roaders not only did not accept it but also cursed them as "irregular" and "unqualified," saying it was "a dead end," and refused to recognize it, not even allowing them to participate in general teaching meetings. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Tuan Mountain Production Brigade were furious, ignoring their tricks, "You manage your public-run, I manage my people-run!" They said, who cares about the recognition of those gentlemen, they don't recognize it, we poor and lower-middle peasants recognize it! They said, what is qualified or not, conforming to Mao Zedong Thought is the most qualified! What is regular or not, serving us poor and lower-middle peasants is the most regular! What is the way out or not, letting children learn to read, work, and hold power well for us poor and lower-middle peasants is the best way out!

The persecution and oppression of a small group of capitalist roaders further strengthened the poor and lower-middle peasants' determination to persist in running the school. Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Tuan Mountain Primary School had abolished the examination system that only recognized scores and ignored ideology. It broke the old rules of age restrictions for enrollment, gave priority to enrolling and waiving tuition fees for the children of poor and lower-middle peasants, and smashed the old framework of suspending or expelling the children of poor and lower-middle peasants. In terms of teaching content, it simplified and cut out some courses unrelated to the countryside, and strengthened the teaching of rural application writing, rural accounting knowledge, and abacus. Some children of poor and lower-middle peasants had to help adults take care of children or herd cattle for the team, and the school allowed them to bring children to school and attend classes, and allowed herdsmen to bring cattle to the school gate to listen to classes. When the children of poor and lower-middle peasants attending school were sick, or when it was inconvenient to cross mountains and valleys in rainy and snowy weather, the school teachers went to their homes to teach.

The nine poor peasants and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, who had been tempered through more than ten years of storms and waves, became more steadfast in their position and more resolute in their fighting spirit during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They led the revolutionary teachers and students of Tuan Mountain Primary School to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launch a thorough criticism of Liu Shaoqi, and thoroughly criticize the revisionist educational line, severely criticizing the revisionist goods advocated by Liu Shaoqi such as "study to be an official" and "intellectual education first," making Tuan Mountain People-Run Primary School always advance victoriously along Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line.

	Experience

Reviewing the eighteen-year-long arduous and tortuous struggle, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Tuan Mountain Production Brigade deeply realized that the struggle in running the school was a struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines; the focus of the struggle was always around the issue of "power." With power comes everything. The poor and lower-middle peasants firmly grasped the power to manage the school and established a leading body composed of the poor and lower-middle peasants as the mainstay, with revolutionary cadres and revolutionary teachers and students participating. Only then could the school adhere to the proletarian political direction, grasp the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought without deviation; only then could it break the frameworks of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line and establish Mao Zedong's educational revolutionary thoughts, opening the door for the children of poor and lower-middle peasants to attend school and rapidly popularizing rural education; only then could it reform and create a set of brand-new teaching contents and methods that meet the needs of the three great revolutionary movements in the countryside, enabling students to develop comprehensively in terms of morality, intelligence, and physical fitness; only then could it build a revolutionary teaching staff, ending the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling the school, and enabling the poor and lower-middle peasants to forever occupy the socialist educational front in the countryside.

Chairman Mao's latest instruction that "in the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants" greatly inspired the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary teachers and students in Tuan Mountain Production Brigade. They were overjoyed and spread the news, feeling that their eighteen-year-long persistence in running the school was in line with Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, and were determined to continue to advance along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao. They have changed the four-two segmented system of the original primary school to a five-year continuous system and the three-year junior high school system to a two-year system. They also organized two off-campus study groups, adopting the method of students teaching students and teachers regularly visiting to tutor, so that all the children of poor and lower-middle peasants who could not attend school received education. Inside and outside the school, the "three loyalties" activities were widely carried out, and reading Chairman Mao's works every day has become the first need in the lives of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary teachers and students.

    九户贫农坚持办学十八年（调查报告）
    安徽省金寨县西庄公社团山小学，位于革命老根据地大别山区的团山之巅。这是一所由团山大队九户贫农创办的民办小学。十八年来，这个学校沿着毛主席无产阶级教育路线，在两个阶级、两条路线的激烈斗争中不断发展，越办越好。贫下中农打心眼里热爱这所小学。他们说：“我们自己办的小学就是好，处处用毛泽东思想育新苗。有了这样的人接班，社会主义江山一定保得牢。”
    巨变
    团山大队一共有一百一十四户人家。解放以前，除六户地主、两户富农有人上学念书以外，一百零三户贫下中农祖祖辈辈是文盲。一九五○年，在土改工作队支持下，方临旺等九户贫农利用祠堂创办了团山民办小学，十三名贫下中农子女破天荒地跨进了学校的大门。十八年中，贫下中农自己动手，先后扩建了校舍十二间，现在已发展成为有三名教师教学的三个复式班的完全小学，并附设了初中班，有七十二名儿童在这里学习。全大队先后入学的达二百零一人，占人口总数的百分之四十以上。贫下中农能够入学的子女全部受到了教育。现在读初中也不用出大队了。
    十八年来，九户贫农带动广大贫下中农突出无产阶级政治，用毛泽东思想教育团山小学的学生。这些学生从贫下中农中来，又回到贫下中农中去，在农村三大革命运动中锻炼成长为“有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”。贫农的儿子潘其新在学校里是五好学生，回到生产队以后成为五好社员，参加了人民解放军又成了五好战士。被群众评为活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子和五好社员的就有五十四人。
    什么树开什么花，什么花结什么果。十八年来，团山民办小学培养出来的学生，同贫下中农一道改变了山沟的面貌。无产阶级文化大革命以来，团山大队更呈现出一派生气勃勃的动人景象：队队有革命大批判的专栏，村村有毛泽东思想广播站，红色宝书家家有，红太阳照亮了深山沟。过去这里山荒田瘦粮食缺，现在穷山沟变成了米粮川，连年向国家出售竹木和余粮。
    斗争
    “农村里地主势力一倒，农民的文化运动便开始了。”团山大队的贫下中农正如毛主席早在一九二七年指出的那样，在土改以后就迫切要求兴办自己的学校。一九五○年冬天，方临旺、潘仲明、潘运谋等九户贫农冒着风雪，翻山越岭，挨门挨户动员贫下中农子女上学。当时，他们办学的劲头可大了，跑几十里路以外去请教师，用土坯垒桌凳，一所贫下中农自己的小学就这样办起来了。
    山沟里书声琅琅。贫下中农乐得心里开花；阶级敌人恨得咬牙切齿，恶狠狠地说：“从来是富人读书，穷人养猪。没见过泥腿子办学堂，穷小子要念书，管叫你兔子尾巴长不了！”苦大仇深的九户贫农心里明白：文权不夺，政权难保，苦根子挖不掉！他们就用本村的两宗血泪仇进行宣传教育。一件是：一九四四年，伪保长李树华为了抓不识字的贫农彭传炳当壮丁，派他送信到伪乡公所，信上写道：“送信者是我保的壮丁彭传炳，到时扣押。”彭传炳直到被五花大绑时才明白自己受骗。另一件是：一九四六年，恶霸地主张涛叫农民黄从发送信到伪乡公所，信中写明：“通匪犯黄从发，到时逮捕。”一字不识的黄从发，在受骗被抓的第二天就惨遭杀害。阶级苦水擦亮了大家的眼睛，广大翻身农民一致表示：这文权，我们贫下中农一定要夺过来，掌下去！这小学我们办定了！地主富农越是反对我们，我们越是要办！他们纷纷把子女送来上学。贫下中农还推选方临旺等九户贫农组成了学校管理委员会，掌握学校一切大权。学校是利用旧祠堂，太偏僻，不便利孩子上学，有的贫农让出自己的草屋和牛栏。随着生产的发展，贫下中农又建窑烧瓦，献工凑料，自力更生盖校舍。贫农李元生没有孩子上学，每次出义务工、献料都有他。他还高兴地对人说：“学校是我们贫下中农自己办的，为贫下中农培养接班人，我虽然没有孩子上学，也有责任办学。”
    以九户贫农为代表的团山大队贫下中农，在办学过程中不仅和阶级敌人斗，和自然灾害斗，还和刘少奇推行的反革命修正主义教育路线斗。这个斗争同样是非常尖锐激烈的，主要表现在对待民办问题上。当时刘少奇在安徽的代理人对民办学校百般歧视，进行打击和迫害。旧县委内一小撮走资派“怀抱公办，脚踢民办”，对团山小学采取不承认态度。有一年，金寨县评比先进学校。团山大队把自己的团山小学也报了上去，列举了团山小学为贫下中农服务的许多事例。可是，旧县委的走资派不但不接受，还大骂他们“不正规”、“不够格”，说是“没出路”，硬是不承认，连开一般的教学会议都不让他们参加。团山大队贫下中农气坏了，不管他那一套，“你管你的公办，我管我的民办！”他们说，谁希罕那班老爷承认，他们不承认，我们贫下中农承认！他们说，什么够格不够格，符合毛泽东思想就是最够格！什么正规不正规，为我们贫下中农服务就是最正规！什么出路不出路，让孩子识了字，会劳动，为我们贫下中农掌好权就是最好的出路！
    一小撮走资派的打击和迫害，更加激起了贫下中农坚持办学的决心。无产阶级文化大革命以前，团山小学便废除了只认分数不管思想的考试制度。打破了入学年龄限制的陈规，招生、减免学费优先照顾贫下中农子女，砸烂了限制贫下中农子女的什么停学、退学的旧框框。在教学内容上，删繁就简，砍掉了一些和农村不相干的课程，加强了农村应用文、农村会计常识和珠算的教学。有的贫下中农子女因为要帮助大人带小孩，或者给队里放牛，学校允许他们带小孩进学校上课，允许放牛娃把牛牵到校门口参加听课。贫下中农上学的子女生病了，或因为雨雪天翻山越岭不方便，学校老师就送教上门。
    经过十多年惊涛骇浪锻炼的九户贫农和广大贫下中农，在无产阶级文化大革命中，立场更坚定，斗志更坚强，带领团山小学革命师生，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大造刘少奇的反，大造修正主义教育路线的反，狠批刘少奇鼓吹的“读书做官论”、“智育第一”等等修正主义黑货，使团山民办小学始终沿着毛主席无产阶级教育路线胜利前进。
    经验
    团山大队贫下中农回顾十八年来艰难曲折的斗争历程，深刻地认识到在办学上的斗争，就是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争；斗争的焦点始终围绕着一个“权”字。有了权就有了一切。贫下中农牢牢掌握了学校管理大权，并建立了以贫下中农为主体的、革命干部、革命师生参加的三结合领导班子，学校才能坚持无产阶级政治方向，狠抓活学活用毛泽东思想不转向；才能大破反革命修正主义教育路线的条条框框，大立毛主席教育革命思想，为贫下中农子女入学敞开大门，迅速普及农村教育；才能改革和创造出一整套崭新的、符合农村三大革命运动所需要的教学内容和教学方法，使学生德、智、体得到全面发展；才能建立一支革命化的教师队伍，结束资产阶级知识分子统治学校的现象，使贫下中农永远占领农村社会主义教育阵地。
    毛主席关于“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校”的最新指示的发表，极大地鼓舞了团山大队的广大贫下中农和革命师生，他们欣喜若狂，奔走相告，感到自己坚持办学十八年的路子，符合毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，决心沿着毛主席指引的方向继续向前迈进。他们已经把原来小学四、二分段制改为五年一贯制，初中三年制改为两年制。还组织了两个校外学习小组，对少数未能上学的贫下中农子女，采取学生教学生和教师定期登门辅导的方法，使他们百分之百的受到了教育。学校内外广泛开展了“三忠于”活动，天天读毛主席著作，已成为广大贫下中农和革命师生的生活第一需要。
