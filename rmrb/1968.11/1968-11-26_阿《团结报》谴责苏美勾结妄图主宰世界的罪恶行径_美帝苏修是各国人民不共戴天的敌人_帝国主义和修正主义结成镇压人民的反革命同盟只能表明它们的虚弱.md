New York Times Agency Tirana November 25th Telegram - The Albanian "Unity" Newspaper published an article on the 24th, condemning the Soviet revisionists' hastening of collusion with American imperialism, pushing the counter-revolutionary global strategy of Soviet-American cooperation to dominate the world.

The article exposes that the Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin recently received the former U.S. Secretary of Defense, executioner McNamara, and two members of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee in Moscow, and held "talks" with them. The article points out that these emissaries of American monopoly capitalists visiting Moscow are obviously to plot conspiracies, attempting to strengthen the Soviet-American alliance to jointly dominate the world.

The article states that Kosygin assured the emissaries from Washington that in the future, he will continue to firmly adhere to the infamous policy of "peaceful coexistence," "easing East-West relations," and achieving a balance of power between the two superpowers. The imperialists of the United States are naturally very satisfied with the traitor Kosygin's enthusiastic declarations. The bourgeois press reported the "loyalty" of the revisionists with large headlines.

The article points out that the collusion between imperialists and revisionists indicates their weakness. The people of all countries are increasingly recognizing that the Soviet revisionists and American imperialists are the sworn enemies of the people of all countries. The struggle against the Soviet revisionists and American imperialists worldwide is surging. This struggle is also developing within the Soviet Union and other countries where revisionists are in power. To extinguish the people's flames of resistance, imperialists and revisionists are sparing no effort to tighten their collusion, aiming to suppress the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries for freedom and independence, particularly against the unshakable fortress of socialism and revolution in Asia and the world - the People's Republic of China.

The article concludes by saying that no matter how hard the Americans and Soviet revisionists scheme and plot to stop the surging revolutionary storm, their goals will never be achieved. In the face of the powerful strikes from the people of all countries and the true Marxist-Leninist forces and revolutionaries worldwide, American imperialism and Soviet revisionism will inevitably perish.

    阿《团结报》谴责苏美勾结妄图主宰世界的罪恶行径
    美帝苏修是各国人民不共戴天的敌人
    帝国主义和修正主义结成镇压人民的反革命同盟只能表明它们的虚弱
    新华社地拉那二十五日电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》二十四日发表文章，谴责苏修加紧勾结美帝，推行苏美合作主宰世界的反革命全球战略的罪恶行径。
    文章揭露，苏修头目柯西金最近在莫斯科先后接见了美国前国防部长、刽子手麦克纳马拉和美国参议院外交委员会的两个成员，并同他们举行了“会谈”。文章指出，美国垄断资本家的这些使者走访莫斯科，显然是为了策划阴谋诡计，妄图加强苏美共同主宰世界的联盟。
    文章说，柯西金向华盛顿的使者们保证，今后将继续坚定地遵循“和平共处”、“缓和东西方关系和达到两大国之间力量的平衡”的臭名昭著的政策。美帝国主义者对叛徒柯西金的热情的表白当然感到十分满意。资产阶级报刊用大字标题报道了修正主义者的“忠诚”。
    文章指出，帝国主义者和修正主义者之间的勾结说明他们是虚弱的。各国人民正日益清楚地认识到，苏修和美帝是各国人民的不共戴天的敌人。全世界反对苏修和美帝的斗争正在日益高涨。在苏联内部和其它修正主义者当权的国家中，这种斗争也在发展。为了扑灭人民的反抗怒火，帝国主义者和修正主义者正在千方百计地加紧勾结，以镇压各国人民争取自由和独立的革命斗争，特别是反对亚洲以及世界的社会主义和革命的坚不可摧的堡垒——中华人民共和国。
    文章最后说，不管美帝和苏修怎样煞费心机，策划什么样的阴谋诡计来阻止日益高涨的革命风暴，他们的目的是永远也不会得逞的。在各国人民强有力的打击面前，在全世界真正的马克思列宁主义力量和革命者面前，美帝和苏修必将灭亡。
