After the publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the workers and People's Liberation Army propaganda teams stationed at the Beijing Geological Institute held large-scale study classes to seriously study the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party.

In the study classes, everyone studied Chairman Mao's recent series of important instructions and the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. By thoroughly discussing the excellent domestic and international situation, discussing the great significance of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and discussing the great and glorious historical mission of the working class, everyone's deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao were further aroused. Everyone's sense of honor and responsibility to carry out the proletarian educational revolution was further heightened, and everyone's understanding of the great revolutionary innovation of the working class leading the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the superstructure was further deepened. Everyone unanimously said: The communiqué shines with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, and every sentence expresses our innermost thoughts. The communiqué is a call to arms, calling on us to continue our efforts and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution; the communiqué is a mobilization order, mobilizing us to launch a new high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation; the communiqué is a verdict, announcing the complete failure of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary conspiracy and his counter-revolutionary revisionist line; the communiqué is a guiding light, leading us forward on the revolutionary path of Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao sent us, the workers and People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, to enter institutions of higher learning to lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation. This is the greatest trust in us. Chairman Mao gave us the most precious gift of mangoes and received the representatives of the capital's workers. This is our greatest honor. Chairman Mao cares so much for us, raising the political status of the working class so high, and asking us to lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the superstructure. We will not disappoint Chairman Mao's sincere hopes. After raising our awareness, everyone actively sought out their shortcomings, examined where they did not meet the requirements of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and consciously engaged in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism to overcome their shortcomings. Everyone, through study, proudly declared: Chairman Mao supports us, and we will make Chairman Mao proud. We will resolutely carry out the various combat tasks proposed by the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and unite more closely around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, unify our thinking, steps, and actions with Mao Zedong Thought, follow the great leader Chairman Mao closely, and carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end.

    驻地质学院工人宣传队大办学习班
    党的八届十二中全会公报发表后，首都工人、解放军驻北京地质学院毛泽东思想宣传队，大办毛泽东思想学习班，认真学习党的十二中全会公报。
    学习班里，大家学习了毛主席最近发出的一系列重要指示，学习党的八届十二中全会公报。通过大摆国内外大好形势，大谈党的八届十二中全会公报的伟大意义，大议工人阶级肩负的伟大光荣的历史使命，进一步激发了广大队员对伟大领袖毛主席深厚的无产阶级感情，进一步激发了工人阶级实现无产阶级教育革命的光荣责任感，进一步提高了对工人阶级领导上层建筑斗、批、改这一伟大革命创举的认识，大家异口同声地说：公报字字闪耀着毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉，句句说出了我们的心里话。公报是号召书，它号召我们再接再厉，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利；公报是动员令，它动员我们掀起斗、批、改的新高潮；公报是宣判书，它宣告了刘少奇的反革命阴谋和他推行的反革命修正主义路线彻底完蛋；公报是指路明灯，它指引着我们在毛主席革命路线上阔步前进。毛主席派我们工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队进驻大专院校，领导斗、批、改，这是对我们的最大信任。毛主席给我们工人宣传队赠送最珍贵的礼物芒果，并接见了首都工人代表，这是我们的最大光荣。毛主席这样关怀我们，把工人阶级的政治地位提得这么高，叫我们来领导上层建筑的斗、批、改，我们决不辜负毛主席的殷切希望。认识提高后，大家都主动找差距，检查自己那些地方还不符合党的八届十二中全会公报对我们提出的要求，自觉地斗私批修，克服缺点。大家通过学习，豪迈地表示：毛主席给我们撑腰，我们要给毛主席争气。我们坚决执行党的八届十二中全会公报提出的各项战斗任务，更加紧密地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，用毛泽东思想统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底。
