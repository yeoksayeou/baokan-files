Jamaican Youth Publication Hails Great Victory of China's Cultural Revolution
Cultural Revolution Forges Chinese People into Steadfast Bulwark

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 8th, the Jamaican organization "Youth Struggling for National Liberation" published an article in the first issue of this year's "Unity" magazine, enthusiastically celebrating the great victory of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The article, titled "Youth Struggling for National Liberation Hails the Great Victory of China's Cultural Revolution," states: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, aims to purge those capitalist-roaders who have infiltrated the Chinese Communist Party, the government, the army, and various sectors of the cultural sphere."

The article states: "The victory of the Cultural Revolution is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for the Chinese people and all revolutionary people of the world; it is a tremendous defeat for modern revisionism centered around the Soviet ruling clique, imperialists, and all other reactionaries. The Cultural Revolution has forged the 700 million Chinese people into an iron wall that no imperialist or revisionist force can shake."

The article states: "Chairman Mao has clearly pointed out that the struggle between capitalist and socialist thought in China will continue for a very long time, and the class enemy will 'constantly attempt to restore capitalism in China every day and every hour.'"

The article states: "Modern revisionists are attempting to seize power in China, to gain control in various fields, to replace the dictatorship of the proletariat with the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and to restore capitalism in China."

The article emphasizes: "However, under the leadership of their glorious Communist Party and guided by the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time—Mao Zedong, the 700 million Chinese people have launched a profound and earth-shaking revolution against the scoundrels and revisionist counter-revolutionaries. This great revolutionary movement is a struggle between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the revisionist line of those in power who are taking the capitalist road."

The article states: "The celebration of the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1st took place as the Cultural Revolution was heading towards comprehensive victory. Revolutionary committees have been established in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions except Taiwan, and the revolutionary masses have taken power at all levels and in all sectors, striving to implement Chairman Mao's instructions on 'struggle, criticism, and transformation.' The working class is leading in all aspects, achieving great victories in class struggle, production, education, and culture in all sectors."

"The thought of Mao Zedong illuminates the path to liberation for all oppressed peoples—those oppressed by imperialism and neo-colonialism, those oppressed by monopoly capital, those oppressed by racism, and those oppressed by revisionism."

    牙买加青年刊物欢呼我国文化大革命伟大胜利
    文化大革命把中国人民锻炼成铜墙铁壁
    据新华社八日讯　牙买加“争取民族解放青年力量”组织的机关刊《团结报》在今年十月出版的第一期上发表文章，热烈欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。
    这篇题为《“争取民族解放青年力量”欢呼中国文化革命的伟大胜利》的文章说：“由伟大领袖毛泽东亲自发动和亲自领导的无产阶级文化大革命，目的在于把那些钻进中国共产党内、政府内、军队内和文化界各个领域内的走资本主义道路的人物清除掉。”
    文章说：“文化革命的胜利进展是毛主席思想的伟大胜利，是中国人民和全世界革命人民的伟大胜利；是以苏联统治集团为中心的现代修正主义、帝国主义者和其他一切反动派的巨大失败。文化大革命把七亿中国人民锻炼成没有任何帝国主义或修正主义力量能够动摇的铜墙铁壁。”
    文章说：“毛主席曾经明确地指出，（在中国）资本主义思想和社会主义思想之间的斗争将要继续一个很长的时期，阶级敌人‘将每日每时企图在中国复辟’。”文章说：“现代修正主义者们企图在中国夺取政权，夺取在各个领域的控制，以资产阶级（资本家的）专政代替工人（阶级）专政，在中国恢复资本主义。”
    文章强调说：“但是七亿中国人民在他们的光荣的共产党领导下，在当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者——毛泽东的指引下，对坏蛋和反革命修正主义者发动了一场深刻的、惊天动地的革命。”文章指出，这场伟大的革命运动是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和走资本主义道路的当权派的修正主义路线之间的一场斗争。
    文章说：“十月一日中华人民共和国成立十九周年的庆祝，是在文化革命走向全面胜利的时候举行的。除台湾省以外，全国各省、市、自治区都成立了革命委员会，革命群众已经在各级和各个领域内掌权，并且正在努力实现毛主席关于‘斗、批、改’的指示。工人阶级正在一切方面进行领导，在阶级斗争、生产、教育和文化各个领域内正在取得伟大的胜利。”
    “毛泽东思想为所有被压迫人民——被帝国主义和新殖民主义压迫的人民，被垄断资本压迫的人民，被种族主义压迫的人民，以及被修正主义压迫的人民——照亮了通向解放的道路。”
