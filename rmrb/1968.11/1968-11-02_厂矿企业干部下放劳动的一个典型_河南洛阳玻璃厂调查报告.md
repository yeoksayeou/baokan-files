A Typical Example of Factory and Mine Enterprise Cadres Going Down to Work
— An Investigation Report on the Luoyang Glass Factory

The Luoyang Glass Factory is a modernized large-scale enterprise. The entire factory has over 4,300 employees. In the past, due to a small clique of capitalist roaders pushing the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi’s revisionist line for managing enterprises, the factory had a bloated and cumbersome organization, with many people doing little work. The factory department had 22 sections, and there were 590 managerial staff. They implemented a set of old systems of "control, restrict, and oppress" on the workers. The cadres were high above, detached from labor and the masses. The torrents of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution washed away all the filth and mud, breaking the old system. In December of last year, after the revolutionary committee was established, they simplified the organization on the basis of streamlining the bureaucracy and sent down a batch of cadres. In August of this year, they studied the experience of the revolutionary committee of Yanshi County in streamlining the bureaucracy and adopted the methods of abolishing, merging, and sending down cadres to further simplify the organization. They also set up a study class for cadres to go down to work, focusing on sending down a large batch of cadres. Now, the entire factory has 112 managerial staff, accounting for 2.6% of the total number of employees. Under the inspiration of Chairman Mao’s latest instructions, it has become a common practice for cadres to participate in production labor.

This factory has two forms of cadres going down to work:

One form is to go down to the workshops and work in shifts. They assigned most of the cadres to 13 workshops according to their different situations, implementing fixed jobs and positions, working the same as the workers, adhering to the eight-hour workday, observing labor discipline, and implementing the labor assessment system. In this way, cadres can eat, live, work, study, and criticize together with the workers, which is beneficial for cadres to better accept the workers' re-education, learn anew, and reform their worldview in the labor process. At the same time, with a large number of section staff going down, the allocation of labor within the factory has changed, replacing some relatively skilled workers from auxiliary labor positions and deploying them to technical production positions.

Another form is to set up "May 7th Factories." They organized some cadres who are not suitable for shift work, under the leadership and participation of the workers, to use the factory's leftover materials to process various products, implementing large factories running small factories. In this way, not only can all cadres participate in labor within their capabilities and have the opportunity to accept the workers' re-education, but also fully tap into production potential, making full use of people and materials. Since this factory set up the "May 7th Factory," they have processed more than 800 boxes of various specifications of glass from the so-called unqualified large pieces of glass discarded in batch production, increasing national wealth by more than 100,000 yuan and meeting the market demand. They follow Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive," with production as the main focus, expanding various types of glass products in addition to developing sideline production. Some workers who enjoy labor protection benefits and have been on long-term leave also actively requested to participate in the "May 7th Factory," contributing their efforts.

The on-duty cadres of this factory also frequently participate in labor. The members of the revolutionary committee and the staff work collectively for one day a week, moving away a "glass mountain" in the factory, turning waste into useful materials. Usually, they leave the office and go to the production front line to participate in and lead production. The revolutionary committee also vacated the office building to be used as workers' dormitories and moved the office to the site. The members of the revolutionary committees of various workshops are basically non-full-time, and the directors and deputy directors all work in shifts. They follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions and are implementing the sending down of on-duty cadres in batches.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "A large number of cadres going down to work is a very good opportunity for cadres to learn anew. Except for the elderly, weak, sick, and disabled, all should do this. On-duty cadres should also go down to work in batches." The cadres of the Luoyang Glass Factory, through several months of labor practice, feel Chairman Mao's latest instructions particularly close to their hearts. They deeply feel that "Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the greatest concern and care for the broad cadres. Sending cadres down to work is a long-term strategy to prevent revisionism and is the necessary path to reforming one's worldview."

Through labor, the broad cadres have undergone a profound change in their spiritual outlook. Some old cadres have changed from preserving their positions and lives to preserving their integrity. An old cadre who used to herd cows for landlords and work as a farmhand in the old society said: "It is not difficult for a person to do a few good deeds, but it is difficult to do good deeds for a lifetime. In the past, I was not intimidated by enemies with guns, but after victory, I felt that even if I had no merit, I had suffered, and it was time to rest. This 'rest' brought laziness, greed, taking, and corruption. I always wanted to eat better, take better care of my body, and live a few more years. Working with the workers, I realized that I had forgotten my roots and truly let down Chairman Mao. In the future, I will never separate from labor and the masses, maintain revolutionary integrity, and follow Chairman Mao to the end of the revolution." A cadre who went from school gates to office gates, used to sit in the office all day, pampered, picky about food and clothing, always felt time passed slowly at work, and after going down to work, under the education and help of the workers, dared not be dirty or tired, quickly learned the technology of cutting glass, and worked diligently, feeling time passed quickly. Some technical personnel were deeply moved by the workers' deep class feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao and selfless, noble character, saying: "Learning technology and foreign languages is not difficult, but it is difficult to temper a red heart loyal to Chairman Mao." They expressed that they would unswervingly follow the path of combining with workers and peasants as indicated by Chairman Mao, honestly accept the workers' re-education.

Once the cadres participate in labor, they get rid of the four airs of officialdom, arrogance, conceit, and pampering, put down their cadre airs, both act as the workers' little students, humbly learn from the workers, and study Chairman Mao's works together with the workers, engage in technological innovation together, care for and help each other, and establish deep proletarian friendships in collective labor. An original deputy director who went down to work in the "May 7th Factory" said: "In the past, if the workers did not call me director, I felt my dignity was hurt. Now, when the workers call me Old Zhang, I feel very comfortable, feeling that the workers regard me as one of them." The workers also said: "Cadres have improved after labor, and the more such cadres there are, the better!" Currently, the broad cadres of the Luoyang Glass Factory, under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, are striding forward on the path of laborization and revolutionization.

    厂矿企业干部下放劳动的一个典型
    ——河南洛阳玻璃厂调查报告
    洛阳玻璃厂，是个现代化的大型企业。全厂共有职工四千三百多人。过去，由于厂内一小撮走资派推行叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇修正主义办企业的路线，机构臃肿庞大，人浮于事，厂部设有二十二个科室，管理人员达五百九十多人。对工人实行“管、卡、压”的一套旧制度。干部高高在上，脱离劳动，脱离群众。无产阶级文化大革命的洪流，冲刷了一切污泥浊水，打破了那一套旧制度。去年十二月，厂革命委员会成立之后，在精兵简政的基础上，下放了一批干部。今年八月，他们学习了灵宝县革命委员会实行精兵简政的经验，采取撤销、合并、下放的方法，进一步地进行了精简，并举办了下放干部毛泽东思想学习班，集中地下放了一大批干部。现在，全厂管理人员留下了一百一十二人，占职工总数的百分之二点六。在毛主席最新指示的鼓舞下，干部参加生产劳动已蔚然成风。
    这个厂，干部下放劳动，采取两种形式：
    一种是，下放车间，顶班劳动。他们根据干部的不同情况，把大多数干部分别下放到十三个车间，实行定工种、定岗位，和工人一样，坚持八小时工作制，遵守劳动纪律，实行劳动考核制。这样，干部同工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同批判，有利于干部更好地接受工人的再教育，在劳动过程中重新学习，改造世界观。同时，由于大批科室人员下放，使厂内劳力调配起了变化，把一部分比较熟练的工人从辅助劳动岗位上顶替出来，投入到技术性强的生产岗位上去。
    再一种是，开办“五·七”工厂。他们把一部分不宜于顶班劳动的干部组织起来，在工人的领导和参加下，利用厂里的边角废料加工各种产品，实行大厂办小厂。这样，不仅可以使所有的干部都能参加力所能及的劳动，有机会接受工人的再教育，而且可以充分挖掘生产潜力，做到人尽其能，物尽其用。这个厂，自开办“五·七”工厂以来，仅利用成批生产中丢下的所谓不合格的大块玻璃，就加工成各种规格的玻璃八百多箱，为国家增加财富达万元以上，供应了市场的需要。他们遵照毛主席的“五·七”指示，以工为主，除扩大各式各样的玻璃产品以外，还准备发展副业生产。一些享受劳保待遇、长期休养的职工，也积极要求参加“五·七”工厂，有一分热发一分光。
    这个厂的在职干部，也经常参加劳动，厂革命委员会成员和工作人员，每周集体劳动一天，搬掉了厂内的一个“玻璃山”，变废料为有用之物。平时走出办公室，深入到生产第一线，参加生产，领导生产。厂革委会还把办公大楼腾出来作为工人宿舍，把办公室搬到现场。各车间的革命委员会成员，基本上不脱产，正副主任都跟班劳动。他们遵照毛主席的最新指示，正在对在职干部实行分批下放劳动。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“广大干部下放劳动，这对干部是一种重新学习的极好机会，除老弱病残者外都应这样做。在职干部也应分批下放劳动。”洛阳玻璃厂的广大干部，通过几个月来的劳动实践，学习毛主席这一最新指示，感到特别亲切。他们深有体会地说：“毛主席的最新指示，是对广大干部的最大关怀，最大爱护。干部下放劳动，是反修防修的百年大计，是改造世界观的必由之路。”
    广大干部通过劳动，精神面貌发生了深刻的变化。一些老干部由保官保命，变成了保晚节。一位在旧社会给地主放过牛，当过长工的老干部说：“一个人做一两件好事并不难，难的是一辈子做好事。过去没有被拿枪的敌人所吓倒，胜利了，感到没有功劳也有苦劳，该休息休息了。这一‘休’，懒、馋、占、贪都来了。总想吃好一点，把身体养好一点，多活几年。同工人一起劳动，这才知道自己忘了本，真对不起毛主席。以后要永远不脱离劳动，不脱离群众，保持革命晚节，跟着毛主席革命到底。”一个从学校门到机关门的干部，过去光坐办公室，娇里娇气，讲吃讲穿，上班总嫌时间过得慢，下放劳动后，在工人的教育和帮助下，不怕脏，不怕累，很快学会了切玻璃的技术，干起活来闲不住，嫌时间过得快。一些技术人员在劳动中，为工人阶级无限忠于毛主席的深厚阶级感情和大公无私的高尚品德所深深感动，说：“学技术、学外文都不难，难的是锤炼一颗忠于毛主席的红心。”他们表示，要坚定不移地走毛主席指引的同工农结合的道路，老老实实地接受工人的再教育。
    干部一参加劳动，打掉了官、暮、骄、娇四气，放下了干部架子，既当工人的小学生，虚心向工人请教，又同工人一起学习毛主席著作，一起搞技术革新，互相关心，互相帮助，在共同劳动中建立了深厚的无产阶级友谊。一位下放在“五·七”工厂劳动的原副厂长说：“过去工人不称我厂长，就觉得伤了自己的尊严。现在工人叫我声老张，心里非常舒服，觉得工人把我当成自己人了。”工人们也说：“干部一劳动变好了，象这样的干部多来一些才好哩！”
      目前，洛阳玻璃厂的广大干部，在毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下，正在劳动化、革命化的大道上阔步前进。
