Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Artists and writers must ... move their standpoint to one side, to the side of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to the side of the revolutionary masses. They must go among the masses and not stand apart from them, keep close contact with them, learn from them, and serve them heart and soul. They must go among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, go into the heat of the struggle, go to the only source, the broad masses, of artistic creation. Only then can they create works of art that are truly for the masses and truly national, scientific, and revolutionary."

Yet, the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi's accomplice, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Tao Zhu, openly defies Chairman Mao's great teachings. He frantically opposes artists and writers wholeheartedly going among the workers, peasants, and soldiers to reform their thoughts. He brazenly tells artists and writers, "You just need to perform well, that's revolutionary. Don't be so tense, you can play around a bit!" He shamelessly says, "Your only goal is to perform well. You can play around a bit!"

Under the so-called "performing is revolutionary," "don't be so tense," and "you can play around a bit" black umbrella of Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices like Tao Zhu, some demons and monsters in the literary and artistic circles have become spiritual aristocrats of the bourgeoisie perched on the heads of the people. The master poisoners Ouyang Shan and Qin Mai, along with those reactionary art "authorities" who specialize in performing about emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties, pick up the leftover spittle of Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices like Tao Zhu. They openly oppose delving into the struggles of the workers, peasants, and soldiers and oppose reforming old thoughts. They have long lived in cities, drawing high salaries, and still shout for villas, cars, mansions, and ginseng to nourish their bodies!

After our great leader Chairman Mao severely criticized the literary and artistic circles in 1963 and 1964, these counter-revolutionary revisionists, in order to put on a show, had to go to the countryside for a superficial visit. They went to the countryside not to reform their thoughts but to "gold-plate" themselves and gain political capital. In 1964, Tao Zhu's black henchman Ouyang Shan went to Hailing Commune in Yangjiang County to participate in the Four Cleanups movement. Nominally, he engaged in the "three together" practice, but in reality, he stayed in a reception hall, ate at restaurants, and even had people serve him with shoes, socks, water, hand washing, and foot washing. For several months, he never picked up anything heavier than four taels. He sat on one side during meetings, remained silent when the masses asked him questions, and the commune members called him "door god." This arrogant bourgeois spiritual aristocrat is completely out of touch with the broad masses. Where is there any trace of combining with the poor and lower-middle peasants?

Obviously, if we slide down the counter-revolutionary revisionist path of the Chinese Khrushchev Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices like Tao Zhu, our literary and artistic workers will degenerate and change their nature. Then, "in a few years or a decade, or in a few decades, a nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration is inevitable. The Marxist-Leninist party will definitely become a revisionist party, a fascist party, and the whole of China will change color." History will regress, and the people will suffer.

The great proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao has timely prevented capitalist restoration and consolidated proletarian dictatorship. Chairman Mao recently issued instructions on re-educating intellectuals and sending cadres to labor in the countryside. We must continue to criticize the number one capitalist roader within the party, Liu Shaoqi, and his accomplices like Tao Zhu, who attempt to turn literary and artistic workers into revisionist spiritual aristocrats to serve their plot of restoring capitalism. Revolutionary literary and artistic workers must firmly follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, take the path of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers, go to factories, go to the countryside, go to the practical struggles, accept re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, thoroughly change old thoughts, and move their standpoint to the side of the proletariat.

    坚决走与工农兵相结合的道路
    解放军某部驻广东省革命委员会警卫连
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：文艺工作者“一定要把立足点移过来，一定要在深入工农兵群众、深入实际斗争的过程中，在学习马克思主义和学习社会的过程中，逐渐地移过来，移到工农兵这方面来，移到无产阶级这方面来。”可是，叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的同伙、反革命修正主义分子陶铸，却公然对抗毛主席的伟大教导。他疯狂地反对文艺工作者全心全意地到工农兵中去改造思想，明目张胆地对文艺工作者说什么：“你要专演戏就是革命化，不要那么紧张，别的（可以）搞不好，演不好戏不行！你们唯一的目的就是演好戏，可以去玩玩么！”
    文艺界的一些牛鬼蛇神在刘少奇及其同伙陶铸之流的所谓“演戏就是革命化”、“不要那么紧张”、“可以去玩玩么”的黑保护伞下，成为盘踞在人民头上的资产阶级精神贵族。炮制毒草的“能手”欧阳山、秦牧之流和那些专演帝王将相、才子佳人的反动艺术“权威”，拾着刘少奇和他的同伙陶铸之流的余唾，公然反对深入工农兵斗争生活，反对改造旧思想。他们长期住在城市里，拿着高薪，还大叫大嚷要什么洋房呀，小汽车呀，别墅呀，还要什么人参补身呀！
    在我们伟大领袖毛主席一九六三年和一九六四年两次对文艺界作了极其严厉的批评以后，这些反革命修正主义分子为了装点门面，才不得不下乡去走马看花。他们下乡完全不是为了改造思想，而是为了“镀金”，捞取政治资本。一九六四年，陶铸的黑干将欧阳山去阳江县海凌公社参加四清运动时，名义上搞三同，其实住在招待所，吃饭到饭馆，甚至穿鞋、穿袜、喝水、洗手、洗脚，样样都要别人服侍他。几个月内，从未拿过四两重的东西。他开会坐一边，群众问他不吭声，社员称他是“门神公”。这种派头十足的资产阶级精神贵族，同广大群众格格不入，那有半点同贫下中农相结合的味道。
    显然，如果按照中国赫鲁晓夫刘少奇以及他的同伙陶铸的这条反革命修正主义的路子滑下去，我们的文艺工作者就要蜕化变质，那就会“少则几年、十几年，多则几十年，就不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟，马列主义的党就一定会变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党，整个中国就要改变颜色了。”历史就会倒退，人民就要遭殃。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，非常及时地防止了资本主义复辟，巩固了无产阶级专政。毛主席最近又发出了对知识分子再教育和广大干部下放劳动的指示。我们必须继续批判党内头号走资派刘少奇和他的同伙陶铸之流，妄图把文艺工作者变成修正主义的精神贵族，去为他们复辟资本主义的阴谋服务。革命的文艺工作者必须坚定不移地沿着毛主席指引的方向，走与工农兵相结合的道路，到工厂中去，到农村中去，到实际斗争中去，接受工农兵的再教育，彻底改变旧思想，把立足点移到无产阶级这方面来。
