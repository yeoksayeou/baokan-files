The Soviet revisionist clique has long since degenerated into social imperialism. The "Warsaw Pact" is their tool for manipulating Eastern European countries politically and militarily, pushing forward their social imperialist policy of aggression. The "Council for Mutual Economic Assistance" (CMEA) has long since become a tool for them to control the finances and economies of these countries, enslaving and plundering the people of Eastern Europe.

Great Leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "The reactionary governments of imperialism, despite doing counter-revolutionary work every day, always speak of 'justice and morality' in their mouths and official documents, or at least some 'justice and morality,' and never tell the truth." The Soviet social imperialists are exactly like this. They clearly use the CMEA to push forward Great Power chauvinism, national selfishness, and neo-colonialism, carrying out ruthless exploitation and plunder of the people of Eastern Europe. However, in many official documents, they talk about how the CMEA is based on the principle of "international socialist division of labor," and how it is "completely equal, respecting sovereignty and national interests, mutual benefit, and fraternal aid," and how it is "cooperating comprehensively in the economic, scientific, and technological fields," and so on, with sweet words. But the Soviet people, the people of Eastern Europe, and the revolutionary people of the world are increasingly seeing through the fact that the Soviet revisionists are essentially of the same ilk as the American imperialists.

The Soviet revisionists, in order to push forward their so-called "international socialist division of labor," have created many counter-revolutionary public opinions. They say that the "increasingly rapid pace of technological development is limiting the possibility for relatively small countries to solve a large number of complex problems through their own strength"; that "many member countries of the CMEA cannot guarantee the establishment of a sufficient and effective national economy on the basis of high productivity, the extensive use of modern machinery, equipment, and technology," because these countries have "small domestic markets" and "lack scientists and designers." According to the logic of the Soviet revisionist clique, small countries should depend on big countries, should become economic satellites of big countries, should become colonies of big countries; small countries can only provide raw materials for big countries, and let big countries develop industry. Isn't this the logic of imperialist bandits through and through!

From a large number of facts, we can see: the so-called "international division of labor" that the Soviet revisionist clique is carrying out in Eastern Europe is essentially a "division of labor" of slavery and being enslaved, exploitation and being exploited, plunder and being plundered, a "division of labor" of the Soviet social imperialist metropolis and its colonies. This "division of labor" is exactly the same as the "division of labor" between the American imperialists and many colonial and semi-colonial countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

From a large number of facts, we can also see: the so-called "production specialization" that the Soviet clique is carrying out in Eastern Europe is essentially deformed production, colonial production. Their so-called "production cooperation" is actually the Soviet clique and the various revisionist cliques in Eastern Europe "comprehensively cooperating" in the oppression, exploitation, and plunder of the people of Eastern Europe. Their so-called "economic integration" is actually making the CMEA member countries colonialized. This is exactly the same as the "economic integration" that the American imperialists are carrying out in Latin America.

The tsars of the Russian Empire were the "gendarme of Europe." Today, a large number of facts prove that the Soviet revisionist clique is the greatest colonial ruler, the greatest exploiter, the new tsars riding roughshod over the people of Eastern Europe. The facts of their aggression, control, enslavement, and plunder of other member countries of the CMEA deeply expose the reactionary essence of the "international socialist division of labor," tearing to shreds the fig leaf they boast about of "respecting sovereignty and national interests" and "equality and mutual benefit." The Soviet revisionist clique, together with a gang of lackeys, blatantly occupied Czechoslovakia, completely exposing their lies about "defending the socialist family."

Great Leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with people's will. No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the forward march of the wheel of history, revolution will inevitably occur, and will certainly win victory, whether it is early or late." The Soviet revisionist clique, using the counter-revolutionary "Warsaw Pact" and the CMEA, is carrying out a capitalist restoration in various countries in Eastern Europe, turning these countries into their colonies and dependent states. The Soviet revisionists trample on the sovereignty and independence of other member countries of the CMEA in politics, brutally interfere in their internal and external policies; in economics, they enslave and plunder the people of these countries; in the military, they carry out armed control, even invading with troops, using bayonets to create puppets. These facts have educated the masses of the people, making the Soviet people and the people of Eastern Europe further see through the counter-revolutionary nature of the Soviet social imperialists and the revisionist ruling cliques in Eastern Europe, making the revolutionary people of the world further see through the reactionary face of the modern revisionist clique headed by the Soviet revisionists. The Soviet people and the people of Eastern Europe, who have a glorious revolutionary tradition, are in a new awakening. The modern revisionists headed by the Soviet revisionist clique, like the imperialists headed by the American imperialists, are full of contradictions, disintegrating, and increasingly falling into unprecedented isolation. The day when they are buried by the revolutionary people of the world will not be far off!

    苏修是骑在东欧人民头上的新沙皇
    永忠东
    苏修叛徒集团早已堕落成为社会帝国主义。“华沙条约”是他们从政治上、军事上摆布东欧国家，推行社会帝国主义侵略政策的工具，而“经济互助委员会”也早已成为被他们利用来控制这些国家的财政经济、奴役和掠夺东欧人民的工具。
    伟大领袖毛主席指出：“帝国主义政府的反革命事业尽管每天都在做，但是在嘴上，在官方的文书上，却总是满篇的仁义道德，或者多少带一些仁义道德，从来不说实话。”苏修社会帝国主义正是这样。他们明明是利用“经互会”来推行大国沙文主义、民族利己主义和新殖民主义，对东欧人民进行残酷的剥削和掠夺，却在许多官方文书上，大讲什么“经互会”是成员国之间“根据国际社会主义分工的基本原则”，“完全平等，尊重主权和国民利益，互利和同志式的援助的原则”，“在经济、科学和技术方面进行全面合作”等等甜言蜜语。但是，苏联人民、东欧人民和世界革命人民越来越看清苏修同美帝实质上是一路货。
    苏修为了推行他们的所谓“国际社会主义分工”，制造了许多反革命舆论。他们说什么“日益增长的技术发展速度，正在限制相对地小的国家，通过自己的力量来解决大量的复杂问题的可能性”；什么“经互会”的许多成员国“不能保证他们在高生产力、广泛利用现代机械、设备和技术的基础上，建立一个足够而有效的国民经济”，因为这些国家“国内市场狭小”，“缺少科学家和设计师”。按照苏修叛徒集团的逻辑，小国就应当依附大国，就应当成为大国的经济附庸，成为大国的殖民地；小国只能为大国提供原料，让大国来发展工业。这不是彻头彻尾的帝国主义的强盗逻辑吗！
    从大量的事实中，我们可以看到：苏修叛徒集团在东欧搞的所谓“国际分工”，实质上就是奴役和被奴役、剥削和被剥削、掠夺和被掠夺的“分工”，就是苏修社会帝国主义宗主国和它的殖民地的“分工”。这种“分工”同美帝和亚、非、拉美许多殖民地半殖民地国家的“分工”，是一模一样的。
    从大量的事实中，我们还可以看到：苏修集团在东欧搞的所谓“生产专业化”，实质上就是生产畸形化，就是生产殖民地化。他们搞的所谓“生产合作”，其实就是苏修集团和东欧各修正主义集团在压迫、剥削和掠夺东欧人民方面进行“全面合作”。他们搞的所谓“经济一体化”，实际上就是使“经互会”成员国殖民地化。这同美帝在拉美搞的“经济一体化”，是一模一样的。
    帝俄时代的沙皇是“欧洲的宪兵”，今天大量的事实证明，苏修叛徒集团是东欧人民最大的殖民统治者，最大的剥削者，是骑在东欧各国人民头上的新沙皇。他们对“经互会”其他成员国的侵略、控制、奴役和掠夺的事实，深刻地揭露了“国际社会主义分工”的反动实质，把他们所吹嘘的“尊重主权和国民利益”、“平等互利”的遮羞布撕得粉碎。苏修叛徒集团纠集一伙娄罗，赤裸裸地侵占捷克斯洛伐克，更是完全戳穿了他们所谓“保卫社会主义大家庭”的骗人鬼话。
    伟大领袖毛主席早就指出：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”苏修叛徒集团利用反革命的“华沙条约”和“经互会”，在东欧各国实行资本主义复辟，使这些国家变成他们的殖民地和附属国。苏修在政治上肆意践踏“经互会”其他成员国的主权和独立，粗暴地干涉这些国家的内外政策；在经济上奴役和掠夺这些国家的人民；在军事上实行武装控制，甚至出兵侵略，用刺刀制造傀儡。这些事实教育了人民群众，使苏联人民和东欧人民进一步认清苏修社会帝国主义和东欧各修正主义统治集团的反革命本质，使世界革命人民进一步看清以苏修为首的现代修正主义集团的反动面目。具有光荣革命传统的苏联人民和东欧人民正处于新的觉醒之中。以苏修叛徒集团为首的现代修正主义者和以美帝为首的帝国主义者一样，矛盾重重，分崩离析，日益陷于空前的孤立。他们被世界革命人民葬入坟墓的日子已经不会很远了！
