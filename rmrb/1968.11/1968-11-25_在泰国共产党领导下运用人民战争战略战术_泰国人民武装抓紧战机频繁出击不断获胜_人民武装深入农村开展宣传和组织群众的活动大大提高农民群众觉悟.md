Under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, the Thai people's armed forces have been seizing opportunities to launch frequent attacks and achieve continuous victories by employing Chairman Mao's strategy and tactics of people's war.

The "Voice of the Thai People" radio station recently broadcasted that the people's armed forces in northern and northeastern Thailand, under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, have been seizing favorable opportunities to launch frequent attacks, achieving one victory after another.

The radio station reported that, according to incomplete statistics, from the beginning of this year to the end of October, the people's armed forces in Chiang Rai and Nan provinces in the north have engaged in 120 battles with the enemy, annihilating a large number of enemy forces, shooting down or damaging more than 10 enemy helicopters, and dealing a heavy blow to the U.S.-Thai reactionaries.

Currently, the people's armed forces in Chiang Rai Province are actively carrying out anti-enemy activities in various counties. On the 10th, the people's armed forces in Thoeng County successfully ambushed an enemy jeep, annihilating seven enemy personnel. Recently, the people's armed forces in Thoeng County also attacked an enemy outpost and intercepted enemy forces sent to "suppress" the people's armed forces. The people's armed forces in Chiang Khan County have also launched multiple ambushes against enemy reactionary military police. Since March of this year, the people in Bang County, who have been carrying out armed struggle, have engaged in 15 battles with the enemy by October, killing and wounding many enemy personnel.

The radio station said that the people's armed forces in the northeast have also been seizing favorable opportunities to launch frequent attacks. According to incomplete statistics, from October 28 to November 3, the people's armed forces in Sa Wan, Sakhon Nakhon Province, launched three attacks on enemy outposts, killing and wounding a batch of enemy personnel; at the same time, they repelled three sudden enemy attacks and executed a traitor who betrayed the people.

The people's armed forces in Thoeng County, Chiang Rai Province, and Nakhon Phanom Province have also sent armed propaganda teams to rural areas to carry out propaganda and organizational work among the masses. Through these activities, the political awareness of the peasant masses has been greatly heightened, helping them understand who their friends and enemies are. Many peasants, after raising their awareness, have sent their children to join the people's armed forces.

The "Voice of the Thai People" radio station broadcasted on the 23rd that under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, the people's armed forces in Nakhon Chai Si County, Phitsanulok Province, employed flexible and mobile strategies and tactics, concentrated superior forces, and launched a night attack on an enemy camp, achieving complete annihilation of the enemy.

The radio station reported that at 4 a.m. on the 21st, the people's armed forces in Nakhon Chai Si County bravely attacked an enemy military police outpost four kilometers away from the county seat, burning down the enemy barracks, annihilating 12 military police, and seizing all enemy weapons and ammunition.

The radio station said that the people in Nakhon Chai Si County began organizing revolutionary armed struggle on September 30 this year. Due to their learning and application of Mao Zedong Thought under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, their armed struggle has rapidly developed and grown stronger. The people's armed forces and patriotic people in various parts of Thailand are thrilled by the significant victory achieved by the people's armed forces in Nakhon Chai Si County.
