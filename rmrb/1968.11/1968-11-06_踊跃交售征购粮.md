The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Tie Ling County, Liaoning Province, have actively sold state procurement grain as a practical action to enthusiastically celebrate the successful convening of the Twelfth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party; to enthusiastically welcome the publication of the communiqué of the Twelfth Plenary Session of the Party; to enthusiastically support the expulsion of the traitor, enemy agent, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever and the revocation of all his Party and state positions; and to enthusiastically celebrate the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

On the morning after the publication of the communiqué of the Twelfth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, more than 300 trucks and tractors loaded with state procurement grain, each adorned with Chairman Mao's portrait, each flying a red flag, each carrying a quote board with Chairman Mao's sayings, and each accompanied by drums and gongs, converged from all directions towards the city's grain storage. The revolutionary action of the poor and lower-middle peasants enthusiastically delivering state procurement grain was warmly welcomed by the workers, soldiers, Red Guards, and revolutionary masses in the city. The entire county was filled with a festive atmosphere celebrating the publication of the communiqué of the Twelfth Plenary Session of the Party. Shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!" echoed through the air. The poor and lower-middle peasants shouted, "Learn from the workers!" The workers shouted, "Salute to the poor and lower-middle peasants!" Together, they shouted, "Long live the great People's Liberation Army!" The entire county was united in a surge of loyalty to Chairman Mao. That day, a total of one million jin of grain was delivered, and the entire county was swept up in a wave of delivering grain.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Hou Ba Li Brigade, Long Shan Commune, were threshing in the evening when they heard the news of the publication of the communiqué of the Twelfth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. They immediately became excited, beating drums and gongs to celebrate in the streets, and then returned to the threshing floor without resting, preparing to load the grain onto the trucks overnight. The deputy head of the brigade revolutionary committee, Wei Shi He, discussed with the poor and lower-middle peasants how to deliver good grain. The poor and lower-middle peasants said, "In the past, we ate the state's return-sale grain, which was disloyal to Chairman Mao. This year, our brigade has a good harvest, so we not only have to deliver more grain but also deliver good grain. This is the way to be loyal to Chairman Mao!" Thus, everyone, young and old, was mobilized, carrying, winnowing, and working through the night, finally selecting the best beans to load onto the trucks. The grain delivery trucks set off at 5 a.m.

After hearing the publication of the communiqué of the Twelfth Plenary Session of the Party, the poor and lower-middle peasant members of the Seventh Production Team, Ping Ding Bu Brigade, Ping Ding Bu Commune, finished spreading the grain and held a criticism meeting in the watchtower, criticizing the traitor, enemy agent, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi's fallacies of "self-reliance, self-management, and self-sufficiency," "work points as the key," and "material incentives." They also criticized the erroneous thoughts of "less delivery, more consumption," "less retention, more distribution," and "only one side" in the autumn distribution in the past. The team leader, poor peasant Lin Feng Hai, said, "The decision of the Twelfth Plenary Session to expel Liu Shaoqi, this bad guy, from the Party forever is great. We must continue to criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist poison and definitely criticize him to the end." On the basis of raising ideological awareness, everyone unanimously decided to complete the task of 160,000 jin of state procurement grain while also selling an additional 60,000 jin of surplus grain to express loyalty to Chairman Mao.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have expressed that they will not forget Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, the construction of socialism, the support for disaster-stricken areas, and the support for the world revolution in times of good harvest. A revolutionary wave of actively delivering grain, economizing on grain, and preparing for grain and disaster is forming throughout the county.

    踊跃交售征购粮
    辽宁省铁岭县广大贫下中农，以积极交售征购粮的实际行动，热烈祝贺党的八届十二中全会胜利召开；热烈欢呼党的十二中全会公报的发表；热烈拥护把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外一切职务；热烈欢呼无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利！
    在党的八届十二中全会公报发表的第二天清晨，满载着征购粮的三百多台胶车和拖拉机，车车挂着毛主席像，车车插着红旗，车车带着毛主席语录板，敲锣打鼓，从四面八方向城内粮库涌去。贫下中农热情送交征购粮的革命行动，受到了城内工人、解放军、红卫兵小将和广大革命群众的夹道欢迎。县城内呈现出一片热烈欢呼党的十二中全会公报发表的欢腾景象。“毛主席万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”的口号声震天动地。贫下中农们高呼：“向工人阶级学习！”工人们高呼：“向贫下中农致敬！”他们共同高呼：“伟大的中国人民解放军万岁！”整个县城汇成了工农兵向毛主席献忠心的热潮。这一天一共送交了百万斤的征购粮，全县掀起了送粮的高潮。
    龙山公社后八里大队的贫下中农，头天晚上正在打场的时候，听到了党的八届十二中全会公报发表的消息，立刻沸腾起来，敲锣打鼓上街庆祝，然后大家都没有回家休息，又回到场院打场，准备连夜装车送粮。大队革委会副主任魏士和同贫下中农商量，怎样交好粮。贫下中农说：“咱们过去吃国家的返销粮，就对不起毛主席了。今年咱队丰收了，不但要多交粮，还要交好粮，这才是对毛主席忠呢！”于是，男女老少都动员起来了，挑的挑，簸的簸，干了一个通夜，终于选出最好的豆子装上了车，凌晨五点钟送粮车就出发了。
    平顶卜公社平顶卜大队第七生产队，听到党的十二中全会公报发表以后，贫下中农社员铺完场，在打更房子里开了个批判会，批判了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇“三自一包”、“工分挂帅”、“物质刺激”的谬论，批判了往年秋收分配中“少交多吃”、“少留多分”、“只顾一头”的错误思想。生产队长、贫农林凤海说：“十二中全会决议把刘少奇这个坏蛋永远开除出党，太好了。我们要继续批判刘少奇的反革命修正主义毒素，一定要把他批倒批臭。”在提高思想觉悟的基础上，大家一致决定，在完成十六万斤征购任务的同时，还要多卖余粮六万斤，向毛主席献忠心。
    广大贫下中农纷纷表示，丰收不忘毛主席，丰收不忘共产党，丰收不忘建设社会主义，丰收不忘支援灾区，丰收不忘支援世界革命。一个积极送粮、节约用粮、备粮备荒的革命热潮正在全县形成。
