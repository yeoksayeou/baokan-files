	On the Issue of the Scheduling of the 135th Sino-American Ambassadorial Talks
	Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Press Bureau Issues a Statement
	Xinhua News Agency, November 26th

	The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Press Bureau of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on November 26th regarding the issue of the scheduling of the 135th Sino-American Ambassadorial Talks. The full text of the statement is as follows:

	On November 18th, the U.S. State Department spokesperson and the U.S. Embassy in Poland issued statements, distorting facts to the utmost and revealing the process of Sino-American negotiations on the scheduling of the 135th Sino-American Ambassadorial Talks. They slandered the Chinese side for having no intention of holding the meeting on time and for not responding to the U.S. side's proposals for a long time. In response, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Press Bureau of the People's Republic of China is authorized to refute as follows:

	1. The Chinese side's position on the scheduling of the 135th Sino-American Ambassadorial Talks has been consistent, clear, and in accordance with the principle of mutual agreement. The 135th Sino-American Ambassadorial Talks were originally scheduled for May 29th. On May 18th, the Chinese side proposed to postpone this meeting to mid-to-late November, and this proposal was later agreed to by the U.S. side. Since then, the Chinese side has not changed its stance. The U.S. side's claim that the Chinese side had no intention of acting according to its own proposal is groundless and utterly absurd.

	2. The U.S. side has played many tricks on the issue of the scheduling of this meeting. On September 12th, it sent a letter insisting on setting the date firmly on November 20th. On November 8th, it issued another verbal notice, demanding that the Chinese side respond to its September 12th proposal within five days. This is a typical imperialist attitude. By November 15th, it sent another written notice, groundlessly "assuming" that China had no intention of acting according to the original proposal, suggesting that the meeting be postponed to February 5th or 11th of next year. Before the Chinese side could respond, on November 18th, the U.S. government unilaterally announced the postponement of the talks, violating the principle of mutual agreement.

	It must be pointed out that the days when American imperialism could run rampant and issue orders worldwide are long gone! To expect the Chinese government to accept such imperialist bullying is nothing but a pipe dream!

	3. The U.S. side, in just ten days, put on such a spectacular performance. Why? It is clear that the U.S. government has no intention of holding Sino-American talks this year but is trying to postpone the 135th Sino-American Ambassadorial Talks to next February and shift the blame for the postponement to the Chinese side. In short, this is because the U.S. is about to change presidents, and the U.S. government is in a transitional period between the old and the new, so it must find a way to drag out this period.

	4. Actually, why bother with such tricks? If you need to postpone the talks, just say so! The Chinese side can consider it. The Chargé d'Affaires of the People's Republic of China's Embassy in Poland, Chen Dong, has already sent a letter to Mr. Walter Stoessel Jr., the U.S. Ambassador to Poland, on November 25th, specifically proposing that Sino-American talks be held on February 20th of next year. By that time, the new U.S. president will have been in office for a month, and the U.S. side should be able to make a decision.

	5. For thirteen years, the Chinese government has consistently adhered to two principles in the Sino-American Ambassadorial Talks: First, the U.S. government must guarantee the immediate withdrawal of all its armed forces from the Taiwan Province of China and the Taiwan Strait region, and the dismantling of all its military facilities in Taiwan Province. Second, the U.S. government must agree to sign a treaty with China on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. However, for thirteen years, the U.S. government has consistently refused to reach an agreement with the Chinese government on these two principles, instead focusing on trivial issues. The Chinese government has repeatedly made it clear to the U.S. side that the Chinese government will not compromise on principles. If the U.S. side continues this approach, regardless of which government is in power, the Sino-American Ambassadorial Talks will not yield any results.

### 就第一三五次中美大使级会谈会期问题  我外交部新闻司发言人发表谈话

    就第一三五次中美大使级会谈会期问题
    我外交部新闻司发言人发表谈话
    新华社二十六日讯　中华人民共和国外交部新闻司发言人十一月二十六日就第一三五次中美大使级会谈会期问题发表谈话。谈话全文如下：
    十一月十八日，美国国务院新闻发布官和美国驻波兰大使馆发表声明，竭尽歪曲事实之能事，并且透露了中美双方商谈第一三五次中美大使级会谈会期问题的经过，诬蔑中国方面无意按期开会，长期没有响应美国方面的建议。对此，中华人民共和国外交部新闻司发言人奉命驳斥如下：
    一、中国方面关于第一三五次中美大使级会谈会期问题的态度，是一贯的，是明确的，是符合双方协商一致的原则的。第一三五次中美大使级会谈原定五月二十九日举行。五月十八日，中国方面建议将这次会谈延期到十一月中、下旬，这个建议后来得到了美国方面的同意。此后，中国方面并没有改变过自己的主张。美国方面说什么中国方面无意遵照自己的建议行事，是毫无根据的、非常荒谬的。
    二、美国方面在这次会谈的会期问题上耍了许多花招。九月十二日，它来信要把会期定死在十一月二十日。十一月八日，它又来了一个口头通知，限定中国方面在五天之内对它的九月十二日建议作出答复。这是典型的帝国主义态度。到了十一月十五日，它又来了一个书面通知，毫无根据地“假设”中国无意按原建议行事，建议会期推至明年二月五日或十一日。没等中国方面答复，十一月十八日美国政府又违反协商一致的原则片面宣布会谈延期。
    必须指出，美帝国主义在全世界横行霸道、发号施令的日子早已一去不复返了！指望中国政府接受美帝国主义这种横蛮作法，完全是白日作梦！
    三、美国方面，在短短的十天之内作出了如此精彩的表演，这是为了什么呢？很明显，美国政府根本不想在今年举行中美会谈了，而是力图将第一三五次中美大使级会谈延期到明年二月，并且把延期的责任反加在中国方面。说穿了，这是因为美国要换总统了，美国政府正处在新旧交替阶段，因此必须设法拖过目前这个时期。
    四、其实，美国方面何必这样呢？你们需要延期会谈，就照实说吧！中国方面可以考虑。中华人民共和国驻波兰大使馆临时代办陈东，已于十一月二十五日致函美国驻波兰大使小沃尔特·斯托塞尔先生，具体建议中美双方干脆到明年二月二十日开会。到那个时候，美国的新总统已经上任一个月了，美国方面大概就可以拿定主意了。
    五、十三年来，中国政府在中美大使级会谈中一贯坚持两项原则：第一、美国政府保证立即从中国领土台湾省和台湾海峡地区撤出它的一切武装力量，拆除它在台湾省的一切军事设施；第二、美国政府同意中美两国签订关于和平共处五项原则的协定。但是，十三年来，美国政府一直拒绝就这两项原则同中国政府达成协议，而是本末倒置，老在一些枝节问题上做文章。中国政府已经一再明白告诉美国方面，中国政府是绝不以原则作交易的。如果美国方面继续采取这种做法，不管美国是那个政府上台，中美大使级会谈决不会有什么结果。
