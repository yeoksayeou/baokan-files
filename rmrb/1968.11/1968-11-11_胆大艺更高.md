The revolutionary modern Beijing opera "Attack on the White Tiger Regiment" enthusiastically praises the revolutionary heroism of the volunteers, deeply reveals that Mao Zedong Thought is the source of courage, wisdom, and strength, and powerfully refutes the reactionary fallacy of "skill leads to boldness" advocated by the counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "This army possesses an indomitable spirit. It will vanquish all enemies and never be subdued by them." Yang Weicai, the reconnaissance platoon leader in "Attack on the White Tiger Regiment," is such a hero with a magnificent spirit of vanquishing all enemies. When Yang Weicai accepted the glorious and arduous task of leading the spearhead platoon to "attack the White Tiger Regiment," the so-called "elite" regiment was, in his eyes, "nothing but a paper tiger, strong on the outside but weak inside." He was filled with the belief of certain victory and was determined to fight to the death with the enemy, vowing to "completely annihilate the White Tiger Regiment." On the way to the heart of the enemy, Yang Weicai stepped on a landmine. At this moment, he did not think of his personal safety but of how to complete the mission and ensure the victory of the battle. With his fearless revolutionary spirit, he bravely and wisely defused the landmine. When the spearhead platoon reached the mountain opposite the enemy command post, they suddenly found that the enemy had destroyed the single-plank bridge across the deep ravine. At this critical moment, Yang Weicai decisively ordered: "Fly over the ravine to save time." They were like a sharp spear piercing the heart of the "White Tiger Regiment," ultimately achieving victory in the battle. The reason why Yang Weicai and the spearhead platoon he led could overcome obstacles, cross treacherous terrain, eliminate all difficulties, and achieve victory through unconventional means is that they had the fearless revolutionary spirit of "vanquishing all enemies" and the revolutionary daring of fearing neither heaven nor earth, even if they were to be "ground to powder, they would do so willingly."

Where does the "boldness" of revolutionary soldiers come from? Is it from "skill leads to boldness"? No! The revolutionary model opera "Attack on the White Tiger Regiment" vividly and powerfully proves that the "boldness" of revolutionary soldiers is not due to any "skill," but because their proletarian consciousness is high and their level of Mao Zedong Thought is high. Yang Weicai's boldness is the collective courage of revolutionary soldiers, the heroic courage of the proletariat. This revolutionary boldness comes from the great Mao Zedong Thought, from the revolutionary soldiers' unlimited loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, and from the great internationalist spirit.

On the battlefield filled with gunfire, Yang Weicai saw "half of Korea shrouded in dark clouds, wolves trampling and class brothers suffering"; he heard the soldiers' bitter accusations against the atrocities committed by the American and Li bandits; he thought of "how many people in the world are suffering." The clear class stance of "class hatred, national resentment" made him sworn enemies with the American imperialists. This clear class stance is the class root of Yang Weicai's daring to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire.

The counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing, in order to achieve his ambition of usurping the military and opposing the party, had tirelessly advocated the reactionary fallacy of "skill leads to boldness," attempting to lead our army down the path of the bourgeois military line. The great victory of "Attack on the White Tiger Regiment" thoroughly criticized the shameless lies of "skill leads to boldness." The great People's Liberation Army of China, from nothing to something, from small to large, from weak to strong, fighting south and north, undefeated in a hundred battles, relies on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the brave spirit of revolutionary soldiers who fear not death. Bold and even more skilled. Revolutionary soldiers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, can defeat any enemy that appears strong. Let the reactionary fallacy of "skill leads to boldness" advocated by Luo Ruiqing and his ilk go to hell!

　　胆大艺更高
　　空军某部  小兵
    革命现代京剧《奇袭白虎团》，热情地歌颂了志愿军战士的革命英雄主义精神，深刻地揭示了毛泽东思想是勇敢、智慧和力量的源泉，有力地驳斥了反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿鼓吹的“艺高人胆大”的反动谬论。
    毛主席教导我们：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。”《奇袭白虎团》中的侦察排长杨伟才，就是这样一个具有压倒一切敌人的豪迈气概的英雄。杨伟才接受率领尖刀班去“奇袭白虎团”这个光荣而艰巨的任务时，“白虎团”这个所谓“王牌”军，在他眼里“无非是纸老虎外强中干”；他对这次战斗充满着必胜的信念，决心同敌人血战到底，“定将它白虎团消灭光”。尖刀班在直插敌人心脏途中，杨伟才踩上了地雷，此时此刻，他想到的不是个人的安危，而是如何完成任务，保证战斗的胜利。他以大无畏的革命精神，勇敢机智地排除了地雷。当尖刀班到达敌指挥所对面的山上时，突然发现敌人把跨越深涧的独木桥破坏了。这时，时间紧迫，杨伟才当机立断地决定：“飞越深涧抢时间”。他们就象一把锋利的尖刀直插“白虎团”团部，取得了战斗的最后胜利。杨伟才和他率领的尖刀班之所以能够越障碍，跨天险，排除一切困难，出奇制胜，是因为他们有“压倒一切敌人”的大无畏革命精神和天不怕、地不怕、“粉身碎骨也心甘”的革命胆略。
    革命战士的“胆”从何而来？是“艺高人胆大”吗？不是！《奇袭白虎团》这出革命样板戏，生动有力地证明：革命战士的“胆大”决不是因为什么“艺高”，而是由于他们的无产阶级觉悟高，他们的毛泽东思想水平高。杨伟才的胆，是革命战士的群威群胆，是无产阶级的英雄虎胆。这种革命的胆量来源于伟大的毛泽东思想，来源于革命战士对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚，来源于伟大的国际主义精神。
    在战火纷飞的战场上，杨伟才看到的是“朝鲜半壁河山阴云弥漫，虎狼践踏阶级弟兄遭摧残”；听到的是战士对美李匪军残杀阿妈妮的血泪控诉；想到的是“全世界有多少人民受苦难”。“阶级仇，民族恨”，使他与美帝不共戴天。这爱憎分明的阶级立场，就是杨伟才刀山敢上，火海敢闯的阶级根源。
    反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿，为了达到篡军反党的野心，曾经不遗余力地鼓吹“艺高人胆大”的反动谬论，企图把我军引向资产阶级军事路线的泥坑。“奇袭白虎团”的伟大胜利，彻底批判了“艺高人胆大”的无耻谰言。伟大的中国人民解放军，所以能从无到有，从小到大，从弱到强，转战南北，百战不殆，靠的是战无不胜的毛泽东思想，靠的是革命战士的勇敢不怕死的牺牲精神。胆大艺更高。革命战士为毛泽东思想所武装，什么貌似强大的敌人统统都能够打败。让罗瑞卿之流的“艺高人胆大”的反动谬论见鬼去吧！
