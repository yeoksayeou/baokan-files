In July of this year, the Dongfanghong Commune Hongjiapeng Production Brigade in Zhuolu County, Hebei Province, established a peasant Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team composed of poor and lower-middle peasants, militiamen, and revolutionary cadres. Originally, this team was a unit for propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters. Later, following the example of the worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, it moved into some of the "hard-to-handle" units within the brigade to solve "hard-to-handle" problems. In just two months of practice, the peasant Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team played a tremendous role and achieved remarkable results, demonstrating its strong vitality.

New Situation, New Requirements

The working class has taken the stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation in various fields of the superstructure, greatly inspiring the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. They are determined to follow the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao and carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the countryside swiftly and effectively.

However, some production teams have "hard-to-handle" problems that have not been resolved for a long time. What should be done? Some people said, "If a regiment were sent here to help us, it would be great!" Others said, "If the worker propaganda team came to stay for a while, things would change dramatically." Still, others directly requested higher authorities to send cadres to solve the problems.

To carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation effectively and solve "hard-to-handle" problems, should we rely on our own strength or wait for external help? The leaders of the production brigade discussed this issue while studying Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao taught, "The masses are the real heroes," and "Without the poor peasants, there would be no revolution." Chairman Mao's teachings greatly inspired them. They decided to mobilize the masses, let them rise up in revolution, educate themselves, and liberate themselves.

They held a Mao Zedong Thought study class with the theme "How to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in our brigade?" The poor and lower-middle peasants repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Sixteen Points." They compared their thoughts with Chairman Mao's teachings and said, "The PLA is so busy; we can't add to their burden!" "The workers have heavier tasks than us; how can we drag them down?" Chairman Mao's teachings aroused a strong sense of proletarian political responsibility in them. They quickly realized that carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation is a glorious historical mission entrusted to us by Chairman Mao. Although the burden is heavy, we must take it upon ourselves. "Hard-to-handle" problems are tough nuts; we must crack them ourselves. With heightened awareness, their resolve grew stronger. They loudly proclaimed: Learn from the worker comrades, carry the heavy burden ourselves, follow Chairman Mao, and transform people's thinking! Under the active demand of the poor and lower-middle peasants, the brigade leadership seized the opportunity to reorganize the original propaganda team, taking the worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team as an example, and "moved into" the "hard-to-handle" units within the brigade.

Strong Vitality

The first unit that the peasant Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team "moved into" was the First Production Team. This team had a long-standing "hard-to-handle" problem: the cadres were not united and could not work together.

After the peasant Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team moved into this production team, they first posed a sharp question to the team's cadres: Is there class struggle behind the lack of unity among the production team cadres? This question shocked many cadres. Then, the members of the peasant propaganda team seriously helped the First Team's cadres to expose various complex class struggle phenomena, trace them back to their roots, and quickly uncovered a historical counter-revolutionary who had not been reformed. This person was a two-faced individual who stirred up trouble between cadres and between team members, causing mistrust and disunity. After this bad element was exposed, the "hard-to-handle" problem in this production team was also resolved.

The Fifth Production Team had long been plagued by a struggle between the "Xue" and "Liu" factions. This struggle was also strongly reflected in the new leadership. After the peasant Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team moved into this production team, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching that "in class society, everyone lives in a certain class position, and all thoughts are stamped with class characteristics," they focused on class education, fully mobilized the masses, and launched a campaign of open criticism and exposure of class struggle. The living examples of class struggle deeply educated the masses. They used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to blow open the lid of class struggle in the production team and exposed a traitor who had infiltrated the revolutionary ranks. This scoundrel had infiltrated the party before liberation and later surrendered and betrayed. In the early days of liberation, he infiltrated the party again and, relying on his authority, shielded counter-revolutionaries and continued to cause trouble. After the Four Clean-ups, he managed to sneak into the team committee and carried out feudal clan factional struggles behind the scenes. The masses, with deep hatred for the class enemy, severely criticized and struggled against this scoundrel. The class enemy's crimes of destroying unity among the masses greatly aroused the masses' class indignation and heightened their class consciousness. They said, "We won't be part of the Xue faction or the Liu faction; we will be part of the Mao Zedong Thought revolutionary faction; we won't listen to the ancestors or the fathers; we will only listen to the proletarian headquarters." Many people who shared the same surname or had close relationships with that scoundrel changed their previous attitude of harmony and launched a face-to-face struggle against him. They said, "Those with the surname Xue are not all one family; those with the surname 'Wu' (proletariat) are the real family." The feudal clan concepts that had been passed down for thousands of years in the countryside were smashed to pieces. The revolutionary masses of the "Xue" and "Liu" factions united under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

Through the active work of the peasant Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, the appearance of the Hongjiapeng Production Brigade has changed greatly. Mao Zedong Thought is widely spread, and people's spiritual state has greatly improved. Now, any speech or action that does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought will be criticized by the masses in a timely manner. The entire brigade has seen a new revolutionary atmosphere where good deeds are praised and bad deeds are criticized.

We Trust Such Propaganda Teams

The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team in Hongjiapeng Brigade propagates Mao Zedong Thought to the masses, organizes the masses, and arms the masses, and is warmly welcomed by the broad masses. The peasant Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team has established a high reputation among the masses. Sometimes, even when a couple quarrels, they say, "Neither you nor me, let the propaganda team come and settle it. They remember Chairman Mao's words well; see which rule you've broken?" The community members feel that the propaganda team speaks reasonably, and they are convinced by their words. The cadres also feel that with such a core force, work becomes much easier.

The members of the peasant Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team are selected from various production teams, have high political and ideological awareness, are upright and hardworking, and many are active learners and practitioners of Mao Zedong Thought. They diligently study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, always listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. They are not only propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought but also instructors for studying Chairman Mao's works.

In production, the members of the peasant Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team are also shock troops. All members of this propaganda team insist on "part-time revolution." They work in their respective production teams during the day and gather in the evening to hold study classes and solve problems in "hard-to-handle" units. Many of them take on heavy and dirty work in labor, always setting an example. The masses say, such propaganda team members, we trust them.

    农民毛泽东思想宣传队好
    ——河北省涿鹿县革委会的调查报告
    今年七月，涿鹿县东方红公社洪家房生产大队成立了一支由贫下中农、民兵和革命干部组成的农民毛泽东思想宣传队。它原先是一支宣传毛主席最新指示和无产阶级司令部战斗号令的队伍，后来仿照工人毛泽东思想宣传队，进驻了本大队的一些“老大难”单位，解决“老大难”问题。在短短两个月的实践中，农民毛泽东思想宣传队发挥了巨大的作用，收到了显著的效果，显示了强大的生命力。
    新形势下的新要求
    工人阶级登上上层建筑各个领域斗、批、改的政治舞台，给了广大贫下中农极大的鼓舞。他们决心紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略部署，把农村的斗、批、改搞得又快又好。
    但是，有一些生产队存在着“老大难”问题，长时间没有得到解决。怎么办？有的人说，“要是给开来一连队伍，帮助咱们好好搞搞，可就带劲啦！”有的人说，“要是工人宣传队来住一个时期，就会大变样。”还有的人直截了当地向上级要求派干部来解决。
    搞好斗、批、改，解决“老大难”问题，究竟是依靠自己的力量，还是等待外援？生产大队领导班子的同志们，带着这个问题学习了毛主席著作。毛主席教导说，“群众是真正的英雄”、“没有贫农，便没有革命。”毛主席的教导，给了他们以极大的教育，他们决心放手发动群众，自己起来闹革命，让群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己。
    他们举办了以“怎样搞好本大队的斗、批、改？”为专题的毛泽东思想学习班。贫下中农一遍又一遍地学习毛主席最新指示和《十六条》。他们用毛主席的教导对照了自己的思想，他们说：“解放军那么忙，咱可不能给亲人加重负担啊！”“工人老大哥肩负的任务比咱重，咋能拉老大哥的后腿？”毛主席的教导，激发起他们强烈的无产阶级政治责任感，他们很快意识到：搞好斗、批、改是毛主席交给我们的一项光荣历史任务，担子虽然重，也应当自己挑起来。“老大难”是硬骨头，我们一定要自己啃掉。认识提高了，决心就大了。他们响亮地提出：学习工人老大哥，千斤重担自己挑，紧跟领袖毛主席，要让人的思想换新貌！在贫下中农的积极要求下，大队领导班子因势利导，重新整顿了原来的宣传队，以工人毛泽东思想宣传队为榜样，“进驻”了本大队的“老大难”单位。
    强大的生命力
    农民毛泽东思想宣传队第一次“进驻”的单位是第一生产队。这个生产队较长时期存在着一个“老大难”问题：干部不团结，拧不成一股绳。
    农民毛泽东思想宣传队进驻这个生产队以后，首先给这个队的干部提出了一个尖锐的问题：生产队干部闹不团结，这里面有没有阶级斗争？这个问题一提出，许多干部的思想受到了震动。随后，农民宣传队的同志又认真帮助一队的干部，把各种复杂的阶级斗争现象摊开，顺蔓摸瓜，追根究源，很快挖出了一个躲在后面捣乱的没有改造好的历史反革命分子。这个家伙，当面是人，背后是鬼，挑拨干部与干部、社员与社员之间的关系，使他们互不信任，闹不团结。这个坏家伙揪出来以后，这个生产队的“老大难”问题也就随着解决了。
    第五生产队长期以来存在着“薛家”与“刘家”的两派斗争。这个斗争在新的领导班子里也反映很强烈。农民毛泽东思想宣传队进驻这个生产队以后，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印”的教导，狠抓阶级教育，充分发动群众，大鸣大放，大翻阶级斗争的老账。活生生的阶级斗争事实，使广大群众受到深刻的教育，他们用战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，炸开了生产队里阶级斗争的盖子，把一个混到革命队伍里的叛徒揪了出来。这个坏蛋，解放前混入党内，后来自首变节。解放初期，再次混入我党，并依仗职权，包庇反革命分子，继续为非作歹。四清以后，又削尖脑袋钻进了队委会，在背后大搞封建家族派别斗争。广大群众怀着对阶级敌人的刻骨仇恨，狠狠地批斗了这个坏蛋。阶级敌人破坏群众团结的罪恶事实，大大激发了群众的阶级义愤，提高了群众的阶级觉悟，他们说：“不当薛家派，刘家派，要当毛泽东思想革命派；不听祖辈户，父辈户，就听无产阶级司令部。”原来同那个坏家伙同姓或关系较亲的许多人，都一反过去的和和气气的态度，对他展开了面对面的斗争。他们说：姓薛的不全是一家人，“姓无”（无产阶级）的才是一家人。农村里几千年遗留下来的家族观念被砸了个稀巴烂。“薛家”和“刘家”的革命群众，在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下团结起来了。
    经过农民毛泽东思想宣传队的积极工作，洪家房生产大队的面貌发生了很大变化。毛泽东思想开始大普及，人的精神状态大大改变。现在，凡是不符合毛泽东思想的言行一露头，就会受到群众及时批判。全大队出现了“好人好事有人夸，坏人坏事有人抓”的革命新风气。
    这样的宣传队我们信得过
    洪家房大队的毛泽东思想宣传队，用毛泽东思想宣传群众，组织群众，武装群众，深受广大群众的欢迎。农民毛泽东思想宣传队在群众中建立了很高的威信。有时候两口子吵架也说：“不依你，不依我，让宣传队来给说一说。毛主席的话人家记得牢，看你犯了那一条？”社员群众觉得：宣传队说话在理，听了他们的话，口服心服。干部也觉得，有了这样一支骨干力量，工作起来省劲得多了。
    农民毛泽东思想宣传队的队员是从各生产队评选出来的，政治思想觉悟较高，正直肯干，不少人是活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子，他们刻苦地活学活用毛泽东思想，处处听毛主席的话，照毛主席指示办事，既是毛泽东思想宣传员，又是毛主席著作学习辅导员。
    在生产上，农民毛泽东思想宣传队的队员也是突击手。这个宣传队的所有队员，都坚持“业余闹革命”。他们白天分散在各自的生产作业组参加劳动，晚上集中起来办学习班，到“老大难”单位解决问题。许多人在劳动中抢重活，干脏活，处处起带头作用。群众说，这样的宣传队员，我们信得过。
