According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 2nd, news from Southwest Africa states that Southwest African nationalists recently attacked the South African military base in the Kaprivi region of Northeast Southwest Africa, killing twenty South African colonial soldiers and destroying five enemy military vehicles.

The South African colonial authorities hurriedly dispatched reinforcements to the Mpacha military base. However, when these enemy reinforcements arrived, the Southwest African nationalists had already safely retreated to the nearby jungle.

Enraged, the South African colonial authorities carried out mass arrests and suppression in nearby villages. According to reports, the South African colonial authorities shot and killed sixty-three Africans and arrested over three hundred people in these villages.

Southwest Africa was illegally occupied by South African colonial authorities in 1915.

In recent years, the people of Southwest Africa have continually taken up arms to resist the oppression of South African colonialists.

    西南非武装斗争传捷报
    民族主义战士袭击敌人基地，打死殖民军二十人，炸毁军车五辆
    据新华社二日讯　据来自西南非洲的消息报道：西南非洲民族主义者最近袭击了西南非洲东北部卡普里维地带的南非姆帕查军事基地，打死南非殖民军二十人，炸毁敌人军用车五辆。
    南非殖民当局慌忙向姆帕查军事基地派出增援部队，但是当这批增援的敌军赶到时，西南非洲民族主义者早已安全地转移到附近丛林了。
    南非殖民当局老羞成怒，大肆逮捕和镇压附近村庄里的当地居民，据报道，南非殖民当局在这些村庄中枪杀了六十三名非洲人，逮捕了三百多人。
    西南非洲在一九一五年被南非殖民当局非法武装占领。
    近几年来，西南非洲人民不断拿起武器反抗南非殖民主义者的压迫。
