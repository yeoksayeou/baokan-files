Hubei provinces urban and rural areas hold study classes to implement the communique of the twelfth plenary session of the eighth central committee

    Hubei Province's extensive urban and rural areas have established tens of thousands of study classes focused on learning the communique of the twelfth plenary session of the eighth central committee. The broad masses of revolutionary people, with profound proletarian feelings of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, have adopted a revolutionary learning style that combines theory with practice. They study, reflect, summarize, and apply what they learn, effectively promoting the in-depth development of the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

    Since the publication of the communique of the twelfth plenary session of the eighth central committee, Hubei Province has been filled with joy. Various levels of revolutionary committees and military leadership organs have issued notices overnight, responding resolutely to the great call of the plenary session and making the implementation of various combat tasks issued by the plenary session the top priority. They follow Chairman Mao's great instruction that "holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes," and regard holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes as an important method to quickly implement the spirit of the plenary session communique. The standing committee members of the provincial revolutionary committee held a study class on the night of the publication of the communique, studying and understanding the spirit of the communique repeatedly throughout the night. Following the lead of the provincial revolutionary committee, various levels of revolutionary committees also quickly held their own study classes. The heroic working class of Wuhan, with its glorious revolutionary tradition, held extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes in factories and workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams. In just a few days, every factory and team had a study class.

    The Mao Zedong Thought study classes held in various places in Hubei Province have adopted a revolutionary learning style that combines theory with practice, learning one point of the communique of the twelfth plenary session of the eighth central committee and applying it, focusing on the "application" aspect. The study classes have universally launched the "three loyalties" activity of being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and used this as a driving force to combine the learning of the communique with the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, with carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, with thoroughly criticizing the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, and with one's own ideological reality. This has made the learning requirements clearer and the implementation actions more conscious and quicker. Wuhan Steel Institute is the only higher education institution in Wuhan that has not established a revolutionary committee. Under the great inspiration of the plenary session communique, the broad masses of revolutionary teachers and students, under the leadership of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, quickly established 57 Mao Zedong Thought study classes focused on learning the communique. Through serious study, they thoroughly criticized Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and "theory of the tame tool," exposed deeply hidden bad elements, and successfully achieved the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Six days after the publication of the communique, they formally established a revolutionary committee. Various regions, departments, and units have also held various specialized study classes in conjunction with the specific tasks of each stage of the struggle, criticism, and transformation, such as study classes for cleaning up class ranks and study classes for rectifying and building the party. They have closely linked these classes with class struggle reality, truly learning and actively applying the communique, learning first what is urgently needed, and achieving immediate results.

    湖北城乡大办学习班贯彻十二中全会公报
    边学习边运用有力地推动斗批改深入发展
    据新华社武汉八日电　为了学习、宣传、贯彻党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报，湖北省广大城乡办起了数以万计的以学习全会公报为中心内容的毛泽东思想学习班。广大革命群众怀着无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，发扬理论联系实际的革命学风，边学习，边对照，边总结，边运用，有力地推动了斗、批、改的深入发展。
    党的八届十二中全会公报发表以来，湖北省到处一片欢腾，各级革命委员会和部队领导机关连夜发出通知，把坚决响应全会发出的伟大号召作为当前最大的政治，把落实全会发出的各项战斗任务作为压倒一切的中心工作。他们遵照毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的伟大教导，把办好毛泽东思想学习班当作迅速贯彻全会公报精神的重要办法。省革命委员会的常委们在公报发表的当夜，带头办起了学习班，通宵达旦地反复学习、反复领会公报精神。在省革委会的带动下，各级革委会也迅速举办了自己的学习班。具有光荣革命传统的武汉工人阶级，在工厂，在工人毛泽东思想宣传队里，大办毛泽东思想学习班，短短几天之内，就做到了厂厂、队队都有学习班。
    湖北各地举办的毛泽东思想学习班，发扬理论联系实际的革命学风，对党的八届十二中全会公报学一点，用一点，在“用”字上狠下功夫。学习班普遍开展了忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席革命路线的“三忠于”活动，并以此为动力，把学习公报同落实毛主席最新指示结合起来，同搞好斗、批、改结合起来，同狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇结合起来，同自己的思想实际结合起来，使学习要求更加明确，落实行动更加自觉、更加迅速。武汉钢铁学院是武汉地区大专院校中唯一没有建立革命委员会的单位。在全会公报的巨大鼓舞下，这个学院广大革命师生在工人毛泽东思想宣传队的领导下，迅速办起了五十七个以学习公报为中心内容的毛泽东思想学习班。广大革命师生通过认真学习，狠批了刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”和“驯服工具论”，挖出了隐藏得很深的坏人，胜利地实现了革命三结合，在公报发表六天后，正式成立了革命委员会。各地区、各部门和各单位还结合斗、批、改各个阶段的具体任务，分别举办了各种专题学习班，如清理阶级队伍学习班、整党建党学习班等等，紧密地联系阶级斗争实际，对公报真正做到带着问题学，活学活用，急用先学，收到了立竿见影的效果。
