	Throw the Philosophy of Self-Preservation into the Trash
	Vice Squad Leader of the "First Ship Across the Yangtze" in a Certain Unit of the PLA, Wu Shugen

	The traitor, spy, and capitalist roader Liu Shaoqi fervently advocates escapism and promotes the "philosophy of retreat." He rants about how "a good commander in battle talks about only winning and never retreating, but in reality, he has a plan to retreat if defeated." This is a gross slander against the broad masses of officers and soldiers in our army.

	The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "This army has an indomitable spirit, it will overcome all enemies and never be subdued by them. No matter how difficult the circumstances, as long as there is one person, that person must continue to fight." Revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, for the revolutionary cause and for the liberation of humanity, dare to climb mountains of knives and walk through seas of fire, and are willing to sacrifice their lives. In the battle of crossing the Yangtze, which shook the world, our company was tasked with the honorable mission of being the vanguard to cross the river. Our squad was the vanguard squad of the company. We rowed small wooden boats, braving the enemy's fierce artillery fire, facing strong winds and rough waves, and crossed the Yangtze River. At that time, all the comrades in the squad had only one belief: "Cross the Yangtze River and liberate all of China." When the small wooden boat was still tens of meters away from the southern bank, all the comrades in the squad immediately jumped into the water and rushed towards the shore without hesitation. Deputy Squad Leader Sun Huaiqian bravely charged forward without fear of sacrifice, consecutively blowing up two of the enemy's hidden fortresses, but unfortunately was hit by enemy bullets and seriously injured. However, Sun Huaiqian did not consider his personal safety, thinking only of liberating all of China and carrying the revolution to the end! Before his sacrifice, he shouted, "Comrades, charge ahead! Don't let a single enemy escape!" The comrades took over the red flag from the deputy squad leader, shouting the slogan "Annihilate Chiang Kai-shek, liberate all of China," and bravely advanced through the rain of bullets, annihilating the enemy on the frontline and completing the mission of crossing the river. After the battle, our squad was awarded the honorable title of "First Ship Across the Yangtze" by higher authorities. Deputy Squad Leader Sun Huaiqian was posthumously awarded the title of "Hero of Crossing the Yangtze." All of this fully demonstrates the noble quality of Communists and revolutionary soldiers who are not afraid to die for the revolution, giving Liu Shaoqi's escapism and "philosophy of retreat" a resounding slap in the face.

	Revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought have the reddest hearts and the brightest eyes. Liu Shaoqi attempts to poison us with his philosophy of self-preservation, attempting to turn us into cowards like himself who retreat on the revolutionary path, thereby achieving his evil goals of usurping the party, usurping political power, usurping the military, and restoring capitalism. This is all in vain.

### 把活命哲学扔进垃圾箱

　　把活命哲学扔进垃圾箱
　　解放军某部“渡江第一船”副班长　吴顺根
    刘少奇这个叛徒、内奸、工贼，狂热地宣扬逃跑主义，鼓吹活命的“开溜哲学”。他胡说什么“一个好的指挥官在作战时，口里讲的是只准打胜仗，不准后退，其实心里有个打算，万一打败了，还不是开溜。”这是对我军广大指战员的极大污蔑。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，为了革命事业，为了人类的解放，刀山敢上，火海敢闯，抛头颅，洒热血，也在所不惜。在威震中外的渡江战役中，我们连担负着渡江先遣的光荣任务，我们班是全连的先遣班。我们划着小木船，冒着敌人的猛烈炮火，顶着狂风恶浪，横渡长江。当时，全班同志只有一个信念：“打过长江去，解放全中国”。小木船离南岸还差十几米时，全班同志立即跳下水，不顾一切向岸上扑去。副班长孙怀先同志不怕牺牲，勇敢冲锋，连续炸毁了敌人两个暗堡，不幸被敌弹打中，伤势很重。但是孙怀先同志没有考虑个人的安危，一心想的是解放全中国，把革命进行到底！牺牲前他高呼：“同志们，冲啊！别让一个敌人跑掉！”同志们接过副班长的红旗，高呼“消灭蒋介石，解放全中国”的口号，迎着枪林弹雨，勇猛前进，消灭了前沿阵地上的敌人，完成了渡江任务。战后，我们班荣获了上级授予的“渡江第一船”的光荣称号。副班长孙怀先被上级追授为“渡江英雄”。这一切充分表现了共产党人和革命战士为革命不怕死的高贵品质，给了刘少奇的逃跑主义、“开溜哲学”一记响亮的耳光。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，心最红，眼最亮。刘少奇妄图以活命哲学来毒害我们，妄图把我们变成象他那样的怕死鬼，在革命征途上“开溜”，从而达到他篡党、篡政、篡军，复辟资本主义的罪恶目的，是枉费心机的。
