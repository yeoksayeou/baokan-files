A Potent Corrosive Agent

Beijing Railway Bureau Beijing Locomotive Section Political Instructor Tang Xiangchen

Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's thoughts on building the party, our party's broad cadre and party members, whether in the years of war or in the years of construction, have always been able to blend with the broad revolutionary masses, sharing joys and sorrows, and have achieved brilliant victories in revolution and construction.

However, the great traitor, great internal enemy, and great renegade Liu Shaoqi fiercely opposed the great leader Chairman Mao's proletarian party-building line. He peddled the revisionist black goods of the "join the party to become an official" theory, advocating that "in the past, if you passed the imperial examination, you could become an official, and now if you join the Communist Party, you can also become an official. Party members are the reserve list for cadres." This is completely a counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacy, a poisonous opium that corrupts Communist Party members!

The great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China is entirely for the liberation of the people and works thoroughly for the interests of the people. Communist Party members must closely connect with the masses, be willing to serve the people, understand the masses, believe in and rely on the masses, ensure the implementation of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and better serve the people. If one stands above the masses and becomes an official, they will detach themselves from the masses and fall into the quagmire of revisionism.

I come from a poor peasant family and joined the revolution at the age of eighteen. The nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought and the tempering of the revolutionary furnace quickly led me to join the great Communist Party of China. I worked with the masses, sharing joys and sorrows, following Chairman Mao in the revolution. In 1959, I entered the railway cadre school, learned a few characters, and could read books. However, under the deception of the capitalist roaders, I read the black "Cultivation of the Self," and was infected with revisionist thoughts. After coming out of school and serving as the party branch secretary, I thought: "'Suffer the hardest hardships to enjoy the sweetest sweets.' After doing the revolution for more than a decade, now I am the branch secretary, and it's time to enjoy some comfort!" Therefore, I usually floated above, sat in the office doing official work, not thinking about the revolution, but about how to eat better and dress like a cadre. Over time, I seriously detached myself from the masses and from class struggle. Therefore, at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, I once stood on the wrong side and executed the bourgeois reactionary line. With the timely help of the revolutionary rebels, I followed Chairman Mao's instructions: "You must put politics in command, go among the masses, and together with the masses, make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better." I carried the Red Book, participated in physical labor, went deep among the masses, actively checked and corrected my mistakes, and returned to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Every time I recall these events, I am filled with hatred and loathe Liu Shaoqi!

The "join the party to become an official" theory advocated by the great traitor Liu Shaoqi is a potent corrosive agent. With his counter-revolutionary methods of changing people before changing the sky, he attempted to gradually transform our broad party members into revisionist elements, turning them into officials who lord over the people, making them his "tame tools" to carry out his counter-revolutionary revisionist line, thus changing the proletarian nature of our party and state. If his counter-revolutionary plot succeeded, it would inevitably lead to a nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration. The Marxist-Leninist party would definitely become a revisionist party, a Fascist party, and the whole of China would change color. Liu Shaoqi's evil intentions are indeed very clear! However, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution finally destroyed the bourgeois headquarters represented by Liu Shaoqi, sweeping him into the dustbin of history. We firmly respond to the great call of the Twelfth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, continuing to deeply carry out the revolutionary criticism, and thoroughly criticize and expose the reactionary "join the party to become an official" theory!

　　一付烈性腐蚀剂
　　北京铁路局北京列车段政治指导员　唐相臣
    在毛主席光辉的建党思想照耀下，我们党的广大干部和党员不论在烽火连天的战争岁月里，还是在轰轰烈烈的建设年代里，都能和广大革命人民群众打成一片，同甘苦，共患难，取得了革命和建设的辉煌胜利。
    可是，大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇，却拚死反对伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级建党路线。他大肆叫卖“入党做官论”等修正主义黑货，极力鼓吹什么“过去考上秀才就可以做官，现在加入了共产党，也可以做官，这个党员就是干部的后备名单。”这完全是反革命修正主义的谬论，是毒害共产党员的鸦片！
    伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。共产党员只有紧密地联系群众，甘当人民的勤务员，才能了解群众，相信和依靠人民群众，保证执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，更好地为人民服务。高踞于群众之上，做官当老爷，就会脱离群众，就会跌入修正主义的泥坑。
    我出身于一个贫苦的农民家庭，十八岁参加了革命。毛泽东思想的哺育，革命熔炉的熏陶，使我很快加入了伟大的中国共产党。我和群众在一块儿，同甘共苦，跟着毛主席干革命。一九五九年，我进了铁路干校，认了几个字，能够看懂书，但在走资派的蒙蔽下，却读起黑《修养》来，受到了修正主义思想的侵蚀。我从学校出来担任党总支书记后就想：“‘吃得苦中苦，才得甜上甜’，干了十几年革命，现在又担任了总支书记，可该舒服一下了！”因此，平时尽浮在上面，坐在办公室里做官当老爷，不是想革命，而是想如何吃得好点儿，穿得象个干部的样子。这样，时间一长，就严重地脱离了群众，脱离了阶级斗争。所以，在文化大革命初期，我曾一度站错了队，执行了资产阶级反动路线。在革命造反派及时的帮助下，我遵照毛主席关于“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在
  一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好”的亲切教导，带上红色宝书，参加体力劳动，深入群众，主动检查错误，改正自己的错误，这才回到了毛主席的革命路线上来。每当提起这些事，我就满腔仇恨，恨透了刘少奇！
      大叛徒刘少奇宣扬的“入党做官论”，是一付烈性腐蚀剂。他以变天先变人，变人先变心的反革命手段，妄图把我们广大党员和平演变为修正主义分子，变成骑在人民头上的官老爷，做他推行反革命修正主义路线的“驯服工具”，从而改变我们党和国家的无产阶级性质。如果他的反革命阴谋得逞，就不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟，马列主义的党就一定会变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党，整个中国就要改变颜色了。刘少奇的恶毒用心，真是十分清楚！但是，无产阶级文化大革命，终于摧毁了以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级司令部，把刘少奇扫进了历史的垃圾堆。我们坚决响应党的十二中全会的伟大号召，继续深入地展开革命大批判，把反动的“入党做官论”批倒批臭！
