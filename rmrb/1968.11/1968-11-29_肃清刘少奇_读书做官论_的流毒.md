Publicly-run primary schools being relocated to production brigades to operate is a good thing. Based on my experience, this method is the most effective in thoroughly smashing the revisionist educational line and eradicating the poison of the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi's "study to become an official" theory.

In the past, some of our brigade members, due to being poisoned by Liu Shaoqi's "study to become an official" theory, developed some incorrect thoughts. Once, I visited a student's home, and the student's mother said, "I always tell him to study hard, learn more characters, and become a teacher in the future, so he won't have to work as hard as we do." Another time, I also visited a student's home, and the student's mother asked me to "teach" her son to study hard, learn more characters, and become a teacher so he can eat a "comfortable" meal. Look, how many people have been poisoned by Liu Shaoqi's "study to become an official" theory!

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us, "The working people should become intellectualized, and intellectuals should become laborers." We must act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, become "barefoot teachers," and wholeheartedly serve the poor and lower-middle peasants. We should be both brigade members and teachers, and also propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought. In this way, educating the younger generation and cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause will be ensured.

Relocating rural primary schools to brigades to operate is also very beneficial for the ideological transformation of teachers. In the past, our school, due to implementing Liu Shaoqi's revisionist educational line, had a clear distinction between "publicly-run" and "privately-run" schools, with significant differences. At the beginning of each new school year when enrolling new students, some people would say, "If they attend a privately-run school, we won't let them study." They thought that teachers in privately-run schools were barefoot and wore traditional Chinese clothing, which didn't look like "teachers"; while teachers in publicly-run schools wore shoes and socks, had Western-style collars, and looked like "teachers." Therefore, some people's minds were filled with erroneous thoughts of worshipping foreign things. The reason for this phenomenon is that teachers in publicly-run schools were detached from the poor and lower-middle peasants, their worldview was not well transformed, and their lives were special. Furthermore, they used these bad things to corrupt and influence some student parents. This fact also shows that rural publicly-run primary schools must be relocated to brigades to operate, to thoroughly eradicate the poison of Liu Shaoqi's revisionist educational line.

Relocating rural publicly-run primary schools to brigades to operate is also a test for intellectuals. Our great leader Chairman Mao says, "Intellectuals, if they want to serve the workers and peasants, must first understand the workers and peasants, and be familiar with their lives, work, and thoughts. We advocate that intellectuals go to the masses, go to the factories, and go to the countryside." Relocating publicly-run primary schools to brigades to operate is a good opportunity for intellectuals to receive re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants. We revolutionary teachers should actively respond to the initiative of comrades Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu.

    肃清刘少奇“读书做官论”的流毒
    公办小学下放到生产大队来办就是好。依我的体会，这个办法最能彻底砸烂修正主义的教育路线，肃清叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇“读书做官论”的流毒。
    过去，我们大队有的社员，由于受了刘少奇这个坏家伙“读书做官论”的毒害，产生了一些不正确的思想。有一次，我到一个学生家里访问，那个学生的母亲就说：“我天天都叫他用心读书，多识几个字，将来当个老师，省得象我们这些人这么辛苦。”又有一次，我也是到一个学生家里访问，那个学生的母亲要我好好“教”他的儿子用心读书，使他多识几个字，将来当老师能吃碗“自在饭”。我们大家看，刘少奇散布的“读书做官论”毒害了多少人！
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“劳动人民要知识化，知识分子要劳动化。”我们一定要按照毛主席的指示办事，当一个“赤脚教师”，全心全意为贫下中农服务，既当社员，又当教师，又是毛泽东思想宣传员。这样，对教育后一代，培养无产阶级革命事业的接班人，就有保证了。
    农村小学下放到大队来办，这对教师的思想改造也有很大好处。过去，我们学校由于贯彻了刘少奇的修正主义教育路线，“公办”和“民办”界线分明，隔阂甚大。每到新学年招收新生，有的人就说：“如果读民办的就不给他读了。”他们认为民办学校老师是光赤脚、着唐装衫的，这不象“老师”；而公办学校老师则穿鞋着袜，西装翻领，才象“老师”。因此，在有些人的头脑中产生了一种迷信“洋”的错误思想。产生这种现象的原因，就是公办学校的教师脱离了贫下中农，世界观没有得到很好的改造，生活上特殊化，并且反转来又通过这些坏东西腐蚀和影响了一部分学生家长。这一事实也说明，农村公办小学必须改为大队来办，才能彻底肃清刘少奇修正主义教育路线的流毒。
    农村公办小学下放到生产大队来办，也是对知识分子的一个考验。我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“知识分子既然要为工农群众服务，那就首先必须懂得工人农民，熟悉他们的生活、工作和思想。我们提倡知识分子到群众中去，到工厂去，到农村去”。公办小学下放到大队来办，这是知识分子接受贫下中农再教育的好机会，我们革命的教师应该积极响应侯振民、王庆余两同志的倡议。广东省增城县东风公社朱村大队民办小学教师  朱满堂
