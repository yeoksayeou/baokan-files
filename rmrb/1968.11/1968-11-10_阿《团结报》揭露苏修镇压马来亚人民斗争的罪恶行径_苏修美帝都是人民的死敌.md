The Unity Newspaper Exposes the Soviet Revisionists' Evil Deeds of Suppressing the People's Struggle in Malaya
The Soviet Revisionists and the U.S. Imperialists Are Both Enemies of the People

	According to a report from the New China News Agency in Tirana on the 7th, the Albanian newspaper "Unity" published a commentary on the 6th, praising the thriving armed struggle of the Malayan people and exposing and condemning the evil deeds of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists in supporting the Rahman-Li Sianlo puppet clique in suppressing the Malayan people's national liberation struggle.

	The commentary said that under the leadership of the Malayan Communist Party, the Malayan National Liberation Army is continuously growing and is waging a resolute struggle against the reactionary forces within the country, achieving great successes.

	The commentary exposed that the Soviet revisionists openly collude with the U.S. imperialists to sabotage the just struggle of the Malayan people. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique has established "diplomatic relations" with the Rahman-Li Sianlo clique. The Soviet revisionists even invited the head of the Malayan puppet government, Razak, to visit the Soviet Union and provided "military aid" to the puppet clique to suppress the anti-imperialist struggles of the people in North Kalimantan and Malaya. Not long ago, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique also claimed to provide comprehensive "economic aid" to the Rahman-Li Sianlo puppet clique.

	The commentary pointed out that whether it is the U.S. imperialists or the Soviet revisionists, they are all enemies of the people.

    阿《团结报》揭露苏修镇压马来亚人民斗争的罪恶行径
    苏修美帝都是人民的死敌
    据新华社地拉那七日电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》六日发表短评，欢呼马来亚人民武装斗争的蓬勃发展，揭露和谴责美帝苏修支持拉赫曼—李光耀傀儡集团镇压马来亚人民民族解放斗争的罪恶行径。
    短评说，在马来亚共产党的领导下，马来亚民族解放军不断发展壮大，正在同国内的反动势力展开坚决斗争，并且取得巨大的成就。
    短评揭露说，苏联修正主义者公开同美帝国主义者勾结，破坏马来亚人民的正义斗争。苏修叛徒集团同拉赫曼—李光耀集团建立了“外交关系”。苏修甚至邀请马来亚傀儡政权的头目拉扎克访问苏联，并向傀儡集团提供“军事援助”，镇压北加里曼丹和马来亚人民的反帝斗争。不久以前，苏修叛徒集团还声称将向拉赫曼—李光耀傀儡集团提供全面的“经济援助”。
    短评指出，无论是美帝国主义者，还是苏联修正主义者，都是人民的死敌。
