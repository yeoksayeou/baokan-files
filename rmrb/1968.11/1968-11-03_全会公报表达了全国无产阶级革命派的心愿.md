At the moment of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of our Party has been issued. This is a great victory for the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, and a great victory for Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line! At this joyous moment of national celebration, we enthusiastically shout: "Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!"

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! When we heard the news on the radio that you personally presided over the convening of this historic Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, which expelled the number one capitalist-roader, traitor, secret agent, and scab, the running dog of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, Liu Shaoqi, from the Party and revoked all his positions within and outside the Party, we were overjoyed. This not only declares the complete bankruptcy of the bourgeois headquarters represented by Liu Shaoqi, but also shatters the illusions of the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits who attempted to restore capitalism in China. The resolution of the plenary session fully expresses the common wish of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat nationwide and the revolutionary people of the world. I support it a thousand times, ten thousand times!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Looking back at the more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which victory was not achieved under your personal guidance? You personally wrote the great revolutionary document "Bombard the Headquarters" and personally presided over the formulation of the "Decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" and the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, pointing out the direction of victory for us. Then, according to the development of the situation, you issued a series of new instructions and new battle orders to the revolutionary masses of the entire country. Under your brilliant guidance, the revolutionary people of the entire country destroyed the bourgeois headquarters represented by Liu Shaoqi, seized back the power they had usurped, and established revolutionary committees in all 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions (excluding Taiwan Province).

In the early stages of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, due to the poisoning of the "tame tool" theory by the traitor, secret agent, and scab Liu Shaoqi, I once lost my way and carried out the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie. It was your "Bombard the Headquarters" and the great teaching of "It is reasonable to rebel against the reactionaries" that made me return to the proletarian revolutionary line, together with the revolutionary masses of the entire country and the entire Yunnan Province, to rebel against the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, Liu Shaoqi, and his agents in Yunnan, Yan Hongyan, Zhao Jianmin, and others, and to overthrow them and seize their power.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! In the future, I will definitely read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions for the rest of my life, and be a good soldier of yours. I will resolutely respond to your call, further carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and carry the Cultural Revolution to the end!

    全会公报表达了全国无产阶级革命派的心愿
    云南省革命委员会副主任　徐学惠
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的时刻，我们党的第八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表了，这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！在这举国欢腾的幸福时刻，我们尽情地高呼：“敬祝我们的伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    毛主席啊，毛主席！当我们在收音机里听到您老人家亲自主持召开的这次具有伟大历史意义的党的第八届扩大的十二中全会，把党内头号走资派、叛徒、内奸、工贼，帝国主义、现代修正主义和国民党反动派的走狗刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外一切职务的消息，真是高兴极了。这不仅宣告了以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级司令部的彻底破产，而且粉碎了美帝、苏修和蒋介石匪帮妄图在中国复辟资本主义的迷梦。全会的这个决议，完全表达了全国无产阶级革命派战士和全世界革命人民的共同心愿。我一千个拥护，一万个拥护！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！回顾两年多来无产阶级文化大革命的战斗历程，那一个胜利不是您老人家亲自指引的结果啊！您亲手写成了《炮打司令部》的伟大革命文献，亲自主持制定的《关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》以及党的八届十一中全会公报，为我们指出了胜利的航向。接着，您又根据形势的发展，向全国的广大革命人民群众发出了一系列的最新指示和新的战斗号令，在您老人家的光辉思想的指引下，全国革命人民摧毁了以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级司令部，夺回了被他们篡夺的那一部分权力，在全国（除台湾省外）二十九个省、市、自治区建立了革命委员会。
    在无产阶级文化大革命的初期，由于我受了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的“驯服工具论”的毒害，曾一度迷失方向，执行了资产阶级反动路线，正是您的《炮打司令部》和“对反动派造反有理”的伟大教导，才使我重新回到了无产阶级革命路线上来，同全国和全云南省的广大革命群众一起造了党内最大的走资派刘少奇及其在云南的代理人阎红彦、赵健民等的反，把他们打翻在地，夺了他们的权。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！今后我一定一辈子读您的书，听您的话，照您的指示办事，做您的好战士。坚决响应您的号召，进一步搞好斗、批、改，把文化大革命进行到底！
