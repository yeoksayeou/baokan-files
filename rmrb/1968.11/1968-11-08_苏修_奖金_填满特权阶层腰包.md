The Soviet revisionist renegade clique shamelessly boasts that they are currently vigorously promoting a so-called "new economic system" in the country, which uses capitalist profit principles to drive everything. They claim that this is of great benefit to the working masses. The more money a factory makes, the more bonuses workers will receive.

Do the bonuses used by the Soviet revisionists in factories as material incentives really increase workers' income? No, it is not like that at all. Two recent articles on the issue of workers' bonuses published in the Soviet revisionist magazine *Economic Problems* inadvertently admit that most of the bonuses in Soviet factories go into the pockets of the privileged class.

The article in *Economic Problems* states: "The experience of the first batch of enterprises that have adopted the new system of planned work and economic incentives shows that most enterprises use the material incentive funds drawn from profits mainly to increase the wages of engineering and technical personnel and staff. For example, in 1966, 704 enterprises that adopted the new working conditions allocated 18.1% of the funds drawn from profits as daily bonuses to workers, while engineering and technical personnel and staff received 81.7%."

As for the workers, the proportion of bonuses in their wages is much lower than that of technical personnel. The article in *Economic Problems* also mentions the situation in the "Lelya" and "Female Bolshevik" sewing joint ventures, which illustrates this point. After implementing the bonus system of the "new economic system," the average monthly wages of engineering and technical personnel in these two factories increased by 24.6% and 20% respectively in 1966 compared to 1965, while workers' wages only increased by 6.4% and 12.2% respectively. The article also reveals that although the proportion of bonuses in workers' wages is originally stipulated to be very low in various enterprises, even this meager amount of bonuses is often deducted and does not reach the workers' hands.

The wage system implemented by the Soviet revisionists in the country is originally a system by which a small clique of privileged classes further exploits workers. Now, the bonus system stipulated by the "new economic system" further plunders the fruits of labor of the broad masses of workers, making a small clique of privileged classes fatter and faster, accelerating the polarization of Soviet society.

However, the Soviet revisionist renegade clique still shamelessly claims that their bonus system is completely reasonable. The article in *Economic Problems* desperately seeks "theoretical basis" for the situation where the privileged class in enterprises takes away most of the bonuses, shouting that "reducing the bonuses of engineering and technical personnel is groundless," because their "contributions are different" from those of workers. This once again shows that the Soviet revisionist renegade clique, which sings high-pitched tunes about "representing the interests of the working class," is a thorough and thorough new bourgeoisie, the most vicious enemy of the Soviet working class.

    苏修“奖金”填满特权阶层腰包
    苏修叛徒集团无耻地吹嘘，他们目前正在国内大力推行用资本主义的利润原则带动一切的所谓“经济新体制”，对工人群众是大有好处的。因为，工厂赚钱越多，工人得的奖金也就越多。
    苏修在工厂里用来作为物质刺激手段的奖金，真的使工人增加了收入吗？不，决不是这样。最近苏修《经济问题》杂志发表的两篇关于职工奖金问题的文章，就不打自招地供认：目前苏联工厂里的奖金绝大部分入了特权阶层的腰包。
    《经济问题》杂志的文章写道：“首批改行计划工作和经济刺激新体制的企业的工作经验表明，大部分企业把从利润中抽出的物质奖励基金主要是用来提高工程技术人员和职员的工资。例如，一九六六年改行新工作条件的七百零四个企业，在从利润中抽出作为日常奖金的款项中工人得百分之十八点一，工程技术人员和职员得百分之八十一点七。”
    至于工人，奖金在工资中的比例就要比技术人员低得多。《经济问题》杂志的文章还谈到的“列利亚”和“女布尔什维克”两个缝纫联合企业的情况就说明了这一点。在实行了“经济新体制”的奖金制度后，这两个厂的“工程技术人员一九六六年月平均工资比一九六五年分别增加百分之二十四点六和百分之二十，而工人的工资只分别增加了百分之六点四和百分之十二点二。”文章还透露，尽管各个企业奖金在工人工资中的比重本来就规定得很低，可是就连这点微不足道的奖金还遭到克扣，而到不了工人手里。
    苏修在国内实行的工资制度，本来就是一小撮特权阶层加紧剥削工人的制度。现在，“经济新体制”规定的奖金制度，又使广大工人群众的劳动成果受到进一步掠夺，使一小撮特权阶层越养越肥，加速了苏联社会的两极分化。
    但是，苏修叛徒集团竟然还恬不知耻地声称，他们这种奖金制度是完全合理的。《经济问题》杂志在文章里就拚命为企业中特权阶层里拿走绝大部分奖金的情况寻找“理论根据”，叫嚷“降低工程技术人员的奖金是没有根据的”，因为他们与工人的“贡献不同”。这就又一次表明，嘴里唱着“代表工人阶级利益”高调的苏修叛徒集团，是彻头彻尾的新资产阶级，是苏联工人阶级最凶恶的敌人。
