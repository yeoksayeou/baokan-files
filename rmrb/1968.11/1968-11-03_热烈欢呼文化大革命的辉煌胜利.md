The communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Twelfth Enlarged Meeting of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, personally presided over and approved by our great leader Chairman Mao, provides the most profound, systematic, and comprehensive summary of the rich experience of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country since the Eleventh Plenum.

The brilliant victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has convincingly proven that the great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, on the theory, line, policy, and strategy of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, is a epoch-making new development of Marxism-Leninism. It is a powerful ideological weapon for the proletariat to seize power and carry the revolution through to the end. It is a long-term plan for a thousand years and ten thousand years to ensure that the state of the dictatorship of the proletariat will never change color.

Our great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "A proletarian party must also expel the old and absorb the new in order to be full of vigor. Without eliminating waste and absorbing fresh blood, the party will have no vigor." This is Chairman Mao's great development of the Marxist-Leninist theory of party building. The Eighth Plenary Session of the Twelfth Enlarged Meeting of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great directive, expelling the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever and revoking all his positions inside and outside the Party. This wise decision most concentratedly expresses the strong wishes of hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers. We firmly support it!

Liu Shaoqi, this bad guy, is a loyal running dog of imperialism and modern revisionism, a thoroughgoing reactionary, and a faithful spokesman for the interests of the reactionary Kuomintang and the landlord and bourgeoisie. For decades, he has used his usurped positions in the Party and the state to recruit and collude with traitors, form cliques, and establish a thoroughly reactionary bourgeois black command center hidden within the organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat. This black command center openly opposes our great leader Chairman Mao, brazenly opposes the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and madly resists Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, committing heinous crimes against the Party and the people. Expelling this black command center's reactionary head Liu Shaoqi from our Party has dug out a time bomb hidden next to our great teacher of the proletariat Chairman Mao, making the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China, personally founded by Chairman Mao, purer, stronger, and more full of vigor. This not only ensures that the ironclad dictatorship of the proletariat in our country will never change color but also has extremely profound significance for the international communist movement and the entire world revolution. This wise decision of the Plenum deeply reveals to us a great truth: A proletarian party can only maintain its nature as the vanguard of the proletariat and represent the interests of the proletariat and the broad masses of laboring people forever, and lead the broad revolutionary masses to fight against the class enemy and carry the socialist revolution through to the end by constantly "expelling the old and absorbing the new" and eliminating waste!

Celebrating victory, full of enthusiasm, looking forward to the future, full of ambition.

Following the great commander Chairman Mao is the direction and victory! Under the great command of the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao as the head and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy, we will definitely hold the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought higher and higher, stride faster and faster in the great strategic deployment of following Chairman Mao, implement Chairman Mao's latest directives better and better, and forge our red hearts loyal to Chairman Mao redder and redder! Following the victorious course indicated by the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Twelfth Enlarged Meeting of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, we will march forward with our heads held high, seize the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution, and welcome the victorious convening of the Ninth National Congress of the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China!

    热烈欢呼文化大革命的辉煌胜利
    北京部队工程兵活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会全体代表
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持通过的党的第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会公报，最精辟、最系统、最全面地总结了十一中全会以来我国无产阶级文化大革命的丰富经验。
    无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利，雄辩地证明：无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席关于在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，是对马克思列宁主义的划时代的新发展，是无产阶级取得政权以后，将革命进行到底的强大思想武器，是保证无产阶级专政的国家千秋万代永不变色的百年大计，万年大计。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“一个无产阶级的党也要吐故纳新，才能朝气蓬勃。不清除废料，不吸收新鲜血液，党就没有朝气。”这是毛主席对马克思列宁主义建党学说的伟大发展。党的第八届扩大的十二中全会最坚决地落实了毛主席的伟大指示，把埋藏在党内的叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党、撤消其党内外一切职务。这一英明决定，最集中地表达了亿万工农兵群众的强烈愿望。我们最最坚决地拥护！
    刘少奇这个坏家伙，是罪恶累累的帝国主义、现代修正主义的忠实走狗，是地地道道的国民党反动派和地主、资产阶级利益的忠实代言人，是一个货真价实的老反革命。几十年来，他利用窃据的党和国家的要职，招降纳叛，结党营私，组成了一个隐藏在无产阶级专政机构内部的反动透顶的资产阶级黑司令部。这个黑司令部，明目张胆地反对我们伟大领袖毛主席，肆无忌惮地反对战无不胜的毛泽东思想，疯狂地对抗毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，对党对人民犯下了滔天罪行。把这个黑司令部的反动头目刘少奇从我们党内清除出去，从而挖掉了埋藏在无产阶级伟大导师毛主席身边的一颗定时炸弹，使毛主席亲手缔造的伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党，更加纯洁，更加坚强，更加朝气蓬勃。这不仅保证了我国无产阶级专政的铁打江山永不变色，而且对于国际共产主义运动，对于整个世界革命，都有着非常深远的意义。全会这一英明决定，向我们深刻地揭示了一个伟大的真理：一个无产阶级的党，只有不断地“吐故纳新”，清除废料，才能永远保持党的无产阶级先锋队的性质，才能永远代表无产阶级和广大劳动人民的利益，永远带领广大革命人民群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗，把社会主义革命进行到底！
    欢庆胜利，豪情满怀，展望未来，壮志凌云。
    紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，就是方向，就是胜利！在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的伟大号令指引下，我们一定要把毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得更高更高，把紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署的步伐迈得更快更快，把毛主席最新指示落实得更好更好，把忠于毛主席的红心炼得更红更红！沿着党的第八届扩大的十二中全会公报所指出的胜利航向，昂首阔步向前进，夺取文化大革命的全面胜利，迎接伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党的第九次全国代表大会的胜利召开！
