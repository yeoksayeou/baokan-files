A reconnaissance platoon of a certain unit in the Chengdu Military Region of the People's Liberation Army actively responded to the battle call of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, overcame the "criticism has reached its peak" mentality, and continued to deeply carry out the revolutionary criticism, thoroughly purging the counter-revolutionary revisionist poison spread by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, such as Liu Shaoqi.

After the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee was issued, the reconnaissance platoon immediately organized a study session. All the soldiers enthusiastically hailed the great, decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. However, in this favorable situation, some comrades thought that Liu Shaoqi had been swept into the dustbin of history by the revolutionary broom, becoming a "dead tiger," and that after criticizing for a year or two, it was almost enough, thus developing the "criticism has reached its peak" mentality and feeling that the revolutionary criticism could not be deepened.

The Party branch of the reconnaissance platoon attached great importance to this ideological trend and promptly organized the entire platoon to repeatedly study the communiqué, guiding everyone to analyze the new trends of class struggle in the new situation. Everyone felt that the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee had politically and organizationally sentenced Liu Shaoqi to death, but Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist ideology had not been thoroughly purged, and his crimes of betraying the Party and the country needed to be further settled. The great task of struggle, criticism, and transformation given to us by Chairman Mao has not been completed. After discussion, all the soldiers in the platoon further understood the spirit of the communiqué, actively responded to the call of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, and decided to continue to deeply carry out the revolutionary criticism.

The Party branch of the reconnaissance platoon took the following three approaches to steadily deepen the revolutionary criticism:

Criticizing the reactionary bourgeois military line and purging Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist poison

The Party branch of the reconnaissance platoon believed that to deeply carry out the revolutionary criticism, the first step was to criticize the bourgeois military line and thoroughly purge Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist poison. Cadres and soldiers repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teachings on emphasizing proletarian politics, angrily criticizing the great schemer Peng Dehuai's attempt to promote bourgeois "regularization" and eliminate proletarian revolutionization. Everyone pointed out sharply: Peng Dehuai's so-called "regularization" and Liu Shaoqi's "tame tool theory" are of the same ilk. Peng Dehuai attempted to use the revisionist system and regulations to stifle the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, turning our revolutionary soldiers into "wooden men," opening the door for Liu Shaoqi to restore capitalism. Deputy Squad Leader Huang Haizhang said: "The Black 'Self-Cultivation' is opium, 'regularization' is a shackle, Liu Shaoqi is the black boss, Peng Dehuai is the black accomplice. Their evil purpose is to attempt to change the nature of our army and the color of the country. We must never forget to emphasize proletarian politics and to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize and denounce 'regularization,' and overthrow Liu Shaoqi!"

Many old soldiers and cadres also combined their personal experiences to expose and condemn the great conspirator Luo Ruiqing's "big competition" wind. Deputy Political Instructor Jin Hanjun angrily said at the criticism meeting: "Luo Ruiqing's 'big competition,' talking nonsense about 'red heads cannot overcome iron tanks,' and Liu Shaoqi's fallacies of 'technical center' and 'experts managing factories' are of the same tune. Their purpose is to eliminate proletarian politics, making our army deviate from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and become a tool for their restoration of capitalism."

Through the deep criticism of the bourgeois military line, everyone realized that the bourgeois military line is an important component of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist political line and must be thoroughly criticized and purged of its poison.

Fully utilizing the living teaching materials of class struggle to continuously improve the quality of criticism

As the communiqué said, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, after two years of complex and sharp class struggle, an unprecedentedly broad and deep mobilization of hundreds of millions of people has been achieved. Now, seven hundred million people are critics, and everywhere is a battlefield for revolutionary criticism, and everywhere there are living teaching materials of class struggle.

After the communiqué was issued, the Party branch immediately organized all the soldiers in the platoon, along with workers and Red Guards, to go deep into the countryside and study the communiqué with poor and lower-middle peasants, work together, and hold field criticism meetings, allowing cadres and soldiers to have more contact with the reality of class struggle, using more living teaching materials of class struggle, guiding the criticism to develop in depth. At the criticism meeting, poor and lower-middle peasants used a large number of facts to angrily accuse Liu Shaoqi of his heinous crimes of promoting "three freedoms and one contract" and "four freedoms" in the countryside and peddling the "Peach Garden Experience." After participating in the field criticism meeting, everyone had a more specific and profound understanding of Liu Shaoqi's crimes, and the firepower of the criticism became stronger, and the criticism became more profound.

The Party branch also organized the entire platoon to visit the class struggle exhibition hall of Sichuan Normal University. This exhibition hall, with a large number of exhibits, explained that due to Liu Shaoqi's promotion of the revisionist educational line and the organizational line of surrender and betrayal, the power of education had long been in the hands of a group of spies, traitors, counter-revolutionaries, and reactionary academic "authorities." Through the visit, all the soldiers in the platoon had a better understanding of Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes of restoring capitalism in the field of culture and education, and the criticism of Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and the revisionist educational line also had new content.

Closely combining ideological transformation, causing a revolution in the depths of the soul

In the process of deeply carrying out the revolutionary criticism, the Party branch also followed Chairman Mao's great teaching of "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," guiding cadres and soldiers to link their own problems in ideological transformation, bringing the revolutionary criticism to the depths of each person's soul.

The Party branch of the reconnaissance platoon adopted the method of "bringing one's own problems and actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought" to promote a revolution in the depths of everyone's soul. Some old soldiers saw that the national situation was getting better and better, and the units that the platoon was supporting had established revolutionary committees, and they began to have the idea of "thinking about personal issues." In the criticism, they linked this active thought, severely criticized Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the fusion of public and private interests." Some new soldiers who enlisted this year, while criticizing the "theory of joining the Party to become an official," actively fought against selfishness and corrected their motives for enlisting.

Because the criticism was combined with the personal ideological revolution, the forms became more diverse, and the methods became more flexible. Meetings could be held, hearts could be talked about, and self-education could be carried out. Each person, each squad, each class, and each individual could criticize, criticizing whenever there was an issue, at any time, and in any place, turning the criticism into a conscious action of the masses educating themselves, effectively purging Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist ideology's harm to oneself.

The cadres and soldiers of the reconnaissance platoon deeply realized: revisionism is a disaster, selfishness is the root. Only by thoroughly criticizing Liu Shaoqi in the depths of one's thoughts, eliminating the soil on which revisionism relies to grow, can one fundamentally overthrow the traitor Liu Shaoqi. They decided that in the process of deeply carrying out the revolutionary criticism, they would continuously promote the ideological revolution of cadres and soldiers, building the platoon into a fighting collective that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

    成都部队某部侦察连克服“批判到顶”思想
    把革命大批判步步引向深入
    本报讯　人民解放军成都部队某部侦察连，积极响应党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的战斗号召，克服“批判到顶”的思想，继续深入地展开革命大批判，彻底肃清刘少奇等党内最大的一小撮走资派所散布的反革命修正主义流毒。
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表以后，侦察连立即组织学习。全连同志热烈欢呼无产阶级文化大革命取得的伟大的、决定性的胜利。但是在大好形势下，也有一些同志认为，刘少奇被革命的铁扫帚扫进了历史垃圾堆，是一只“死老虎”了，批了一两年，批得差不多了，产生了“批判到顶”的思想，感到革命大批判深入不下去。
    侦察连党支部非常重视这个思想苗头，及时组织全连反复学习公报，引导大家分析新形势下阶级斗争的新动向。大家认为，十二中全会公报从政治上、组织上宣判了刘少奇的死刑，但是，刘少奇散布的反革命修正主义思想还没有彻底肃清，刘少奇叛党、叛国的累累罪行还需要进一步清算。毛主席交给我们的斗、批、改的伟大任务还没有最后完成。经过讨论，全连同志进一步理解了公报精神，积极响应十二中全会公报的号召，决心把轰轰烈烈的革命大批判继续深入地开展下去。
    侦察连党支部是从以下三个方面入手，把革命大批判步步引向深入的。
    批判反动的资产阶级军事路线，肃清刘少奇的反革命修正主义流毒
    侦察连党支部认为，深入开展革命大批判，首先是批判资产阶级军事路线，彻底肃清刘少奇的反革命修正主义流毒。干部、战士反复学习了毛主席关于突出无产阶级政治的伟大教导，愤怒地批判了大野心家彭德怀大搞资产阶级“正规化”，取消无产阶级革命化的滔天罪行。大家一针见血地指出：彭德怀的所谓“正规化”和刘少奇的“驯服工具论”是一脉相承的。彭德怀就是妄图用修正主义的那一套制度、条令，扼杀无产阶级革命精神，把我们革命战士搞成一个一个的“木头人”，为刘少奇复辟资本主义大开方便之门。副班长黄海章说：“黑《修养》是鸦片，‘正规化’是枷锁，刘少奇是黑掌柜，彭德怀是黑伙计，他们的罪恶目的，就是妄图改变我军性质，改变国家颜色。我们一定要念念不忘突出无产阶级政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底批臭‘正规化’，打倒刘少奇！”
    很多老战士和干部还结合亲身经历，揭露、声讨了大阴谋家罗瑞卿刮起的“大比武”妖风。副指导员金汉俊在批判会上愤怒地说：“罗瑞卿搞‘大比武’，胡说什么‘红脑袋撞不过铁坦克’，和刘少奇的‘以技术为中心’、‘专家治厂’等谬论是一个调子，其目的都是要取消无产阶级政治，使我军脱离毛主席的革命路线，变成他们复辟资本主义的工具。”
    通过对资产阶级军事路线的深入批判，大家认识到，资产阶级军事路线，是刘少奇反革命修正主义政治路线的重要组成部分，必须彻底批判，肃清其流毒。
    充分利用阶级斗争的活教材，不断提高大批判的质量
    正如公报所说，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下，经过两年来的复杂、尖锐的阶级斗争，空前广泛、深入地发动了亿万人民群众。现在，七亿人民都是批判家，到处都是革命大批判的战场，到处都有阶级斗争的活教材。
    公报发表后，党支部立即组织全连同志和工人、红卫兵小将一道，深入农村和贫下中农一同学习公报，一同劳动，一同开田头批判会，让干部、战士更多地接触阶级斗争实际，运用更多的阶级斗争活教材，引导大批判向纵深发展。在批判会上，贫下中农用大量事实愤怒地控诉了刘少奇在农村推行“三自一包”“四大自由”，兜售“桃园经验”的滔天罪行。参加田头批判会后，大家对刘少奇的罪行有了更具体、更深刻的了解，大批判的火力就更猛，批得也就更深透了。
    党支部还组织全连参观了四川师范学院的阶级斗争陈列馆。这个陈列馆以大量实物说明，由于刘少奇推行修正主义教育路线和招降纳叛的组织路线，使教育大权长期落到一伙特务、叛徒、反革命分子和反动学术“权威”手里。通过参观，全连同志对刘少奇在文化教育领域复辟资本主义的滔天罪行，有了更多的了解，批判刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”和修正主义教育路线，也就有了新的内容。
    紧密结合思想改造，在灵魂深处爆发革命
    在深入开展革命大批判中，党支部还遵照毛主席“要斗私，批修”的伟大教导，引导干部和战士联系自己思想改造中的问题，把革命大批判引向每个人的灵魂深处。
    侦察连党支部采取“带着自己的问题，活学活用毛泽东思想”的方法，促使大家在灵魂深处爆发革命。有的老战士看到全国形势越来越好，连队担负支左任务的单位都成立了革委会，思想上就出现了“该想一想个人问题”的松劲苗头。在大批判中，他们联系这个活思想，狠批了刘少奇的“公私溶化论”。有些今年入伍的新战士在批判“入党做官论”的同时，主动斗私，端正了入伍动机。
    由于把大批判和个人思想革命化结合起来，形式就更加多样，方法更加灵活。可以开会，可以谈心，也可以进行自我教育，连自为战，排自为战，班自为战，人自为战，遇事就批，时时可批，处处能批，把大批判变成群众自己教育自己的自觉行动，有力地肃清了刘少奇的反革命修正主义思想对自己的毒害。
    侦察连干部、战士深深认识到：修是祸，私是根，只有从思想深处把刘少奇批倒、批臭，铲除修正主义赖以生长的土壤，才能从根本上把叛徒刘少奇彻底打倒。他们决心在深入开展革命大批判的过程中，不断促进干部、战士的思想革命化，把连队建设成无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的战斗集体。
