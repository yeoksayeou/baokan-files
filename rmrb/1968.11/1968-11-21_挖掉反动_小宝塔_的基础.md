	Digging up the foundation of the reactionary "little pagoda"
	Moving the management of rural public primary schools to the brigade level is a major measure to thoroughly smash the feudal and capitalist old educational system and thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the great traitor, great spy, and great saboteur Liu Shaoqi. The old educational system is a "little pagoda," small at the top and big at the bottom. The old primary school education is the foundation of this reactionary "little pagoda." Now, we are fundamentally reforming rural primary school education, which means we are digging up the foundation of this reactionary "little pagoda."

    挖掉反动“小宝塔”的基础
    把农村公办小学下放到大队来办，这是彻底摧毁封建主义、资本主义旧的教育制度，彻底摧毁大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线的一个重大措施。旧的教育制度是个“小宝塔”，上头小，底下大。旧的小学教育就是这个反动“小宝塔”的基础。现在从根本上改革了农村小学教育，也就是挖了这个反动“小宝塔”的基础。
