Good News Reaches Hongqi Village (Shandong Folk Song)

	The red waves of the radio fly in all directions, the spring breeze blows into Hongqi Village. The Twelfth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee shines brightly, the poor and lower-middle peasants are all joyful. It tells of: On the evening of November 1st at 8:30, Hongqi Village was unusually lively, different from usual. A portrait of Chairman Mao hangs high on the big locust tree, and men, women, old, and young sit packed under the loudspeaker. Everyone's eyes look up at the portrait of Chairman Mao, and everyone's ears listen to the loudspeaker. Poor peasant Zhang Grandpa is so happy he can't close his mouth, his tears of excitement flow down. As soon as the bulletin finishes broadcasting, he loudly shouts slogans with a joyful heart: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand long lives! The waves of cheers merge into the waves of the Yangtze River. In an instant, a celebration meeting opens in front of the portrait of Chairman Mao, like golden sunflowers facing the sun. Zhang Grandpa holds the precious book to express his loyalty, words from the heart ring out loudly: The communiqué of the Twelfth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee is good, every word hits the old man's heart. Looking back on the two years of victorious steps, it's all thanks to Chairman Mao, the old man, steering the ship. Remembering the past, Liu Shaoqi, this traitor, spy, and capitalist roader, dared to try to block the car with his arms! Chairman Mao wrote the big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters," waving his giant hand to guide us. The sun rises, and the sky is red all over. Our poor and lower-middle peasants have bright eyes. We smashed Liu Shaoqi's black headquarters, and red flowers of great unity and the three-in-one combination bloom everywhere. The whole country turns red, making the old man sing with joy. All the victories are thanks to Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao is better than parents.

	As soon as Zhang Grandpa's words fell to the ground, suddenly a deep voice boomed from the crowd: "I'll speak!" Everyone turned to look, oh! It turns out to be the Revolutionary Committee Chairman Zhang Zhigang. Old Zhang's eyes gaze at the portrait of Chairman Mao, his oaths ring out clearly: Chairman Mao points out the path of victory for us, we march forward without hesitation. The Revolutionary Committee closely links with the masses and never forgets its roots, it will temper itself into pure steel in the fiery criticism and struggle. It will thoroughly clean up the class ranks and throw a handful of counter-revolutionaries into the trash can. "Purge the old and take in the new" is deeply ingrained, resolutely do a good job in rectifying and building the party. Chairman Mao tells us poor and lower-middle peasants to manage the schools, we vow to write a new chapter for the educational revolution. Grasp the revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness, and contribute to the all-around victory of the Cultural Revolution.

	Zhang Zhigang spoke more and more enthusiastically, but the supporting soldier Little Wang was getting anxious on the side. Little Wang pressed the precious book to his chest, standing in a posture ready to speak. As soon as Zhang Zhigang finished his last sentence, Little Wang hurried to continue: The soldiers of Chairman Mao are loyal to the party, unshaken by wind and waves. Pick up the pen, criticize the traitor Liu Shaoqi, pick up the gun, strengthen preparedness and defend the country. We must be models in supporting the government and loving the people, and we must be pioneers in opposing revisionism and preventing revisionism. If the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists dare to invade, we will resolutely, thoroughly, and completely annihilate them!

	Little Wang clenched his fist and wanted to continue, but the Red Guards student Jiang Xue had already taken over. After Jiang Xue finished, Wei Dong spoke, everyone was excited and full of fighting spirit. This meeting went on until three in the morning, the slogans shook the mountains:

	"Resolutely overthrow Liu Shaoqi! Defend our red sun in our hearts!"

	In the midst of the slogans, the team set out again. Look! The poor and lower-middle peasants are spreading the communiqué in the countryside! You see: Every portrait of Chairman Mao is held high, every red flag is carried on the shoulders, every precious book is held in the hands, and every battle song flies in all directions. This is truly: Follow the great leader Chairman Mao and bravely march forward, the song of victory resonates through the sky!

    喜讯传到红旗庄（山东快书）
    周明英红色电波飞四方，春风吹进红旗庄，八届十二中全会放异彩，贫下中农个个喜洋洋。说的是：十一月一日晚上八点半，红旗庄热闹非凡不同往常。大槐树上高挂毛主席像，大喇叭下男女老少坐满场。双双眼睛仰望毛主席像，双双耳朵听着喇叭讲。贫农张大爷乐得合不上嘴，那激动的老泪往下淌。喇叭里公报刚播完，他高呼口号心欢畅：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！阵阵呼声汇成长江浪。刹那间，毛主席像前开起庆祝会，象朵朵金葵向太阳。张大爷手捧宝书表忠心，出自肺腑的话儿多响亮：八届十二中全会公报就是好哟，句句说到老汉心坎上，回想两年走的步步胜利路，全靠毛主席他老人家把舵掌。想当初，刘少奇这个叛徒、内奸、
  大工贼，妄想螳臂把车挡！毛主席写下《炮打司令部》大字报，挥动巨手为咱指航向。太阳一出满天红，咱贫下中农眼睛明亮亮。捣毁了刘少奇黑司令部，大联合、三结合红花遍地开放。全国实现一片红，直乐得老汉把歌唱。胜利全归功于毛主席啊，毛主席胜过亲爹娘。张大爷的话音刚落地（儿），忽听人群里一声洪钟响：“我来讲！”大家扭头细观看，嗬！原来是革委会主任张志钢。老张双眼凝望毛主席像，声声誓言响叮当：毛主席为咱指出胜利路，咱大步前进不彷徨。革委会密切联系群众不忘本，要在大批判烈火中炼纯钢。清理阶级队伍搞彻底，把一小撮反革命分子扔进垃圾箱。
  “吐故纳新”刻心底，坚决搞好整党和建党。毛主席叫咱贫下中农管学校，我们誓让教育革命谱新章。抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备，为夺取文化大革命全面胜利贡献力
    量。张志钢越说越来劲，那一旁可急坏支农战士叫小王。小王把宝书紧贴胸膛上，扎着个架式要接腔。张志钢最后一句刚说完，小王急忙来接上：毛主席的战士心向党，风吹浪打身不晃。拿起笔，批臭叛徒刘少奇，拿起枪，加强战备保国防。拥政爱民咱要当模范，反修防修咱要当闯将。美帝苏修胆敢来侵犯，坚决彻底干净全部把它消灭光！小王握着拳头还要讲，红卫兵学江早就接了腔。学江说完卫东讲，个个欢欣鼓舞斗志昂。这个会直开到夜里下三点，口号声震得山摇晃：
  “坚决打倒刘少奇！保卫我们心中红太阳！”口号声中队伍又出发，嘿！贫下中农宣传公报走山乡！你看吧：张张毛主席像高高举，面面红旗肩上扛，本本红书手中捧，声声战歌飞四方。这真是：紧跟伟大领袖毛主席奋勇前进，胜利的战歌漫天扬！
