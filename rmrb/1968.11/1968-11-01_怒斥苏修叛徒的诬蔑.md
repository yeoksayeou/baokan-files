After the publication of the experiences of the "May Seventh" Cadres School in Liuhe, Heilongjiang regarding the placement of cadres for labor, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique went into a hysterical frenzy. The Soviet mouthpiece *Izvestia* launched a vicious attack on our "May Seventh" Cadres School, claiming that it aims to "direct the spearhead" at a large number of party and government cadres, "completely isolating them and severing any connection with the people," and so on. We, the revolutionary fighters of the "May Seventh" Cadres School, are filled with indignation at the Soviet revisionist traitors' shameless slander.

Cultivating and fostering what kind of cadre force is a matter of who holds power in the proletarian dictatorship. Our great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "We must insist on the system of cadres participating in collective productive labor. Our party and state cadres are ordinary laborers, not overlords riding on the backs of the people. Through participating in collective productive labor, cadres maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the laboring people. This is a fundamental matter in the socialist system, which helps to overcome bureaucratism, prevent revisionism and dogmatism." We follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, actively engage in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, and blend in with the workers and peasants, feeling immense joy and pride. Whether a cadre is an ordinary laborer or an official lord, this is a product of two opposing social systems. Cadres in a socialist country must emphasize proletarian politics, wholeheartedly serve the people, closely unite with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and be ordinary laborers; cadres in a revisionist country will inevitably serve a small clique of exploiters and oppressors of the people, bully the broad laboring masses, and become overlords riding on the backs of the people. For revolutionary cadres, is there a more glorious title than "ordinary laborer"?

The revolutionary fighters of the "May Seventh" Cadres School include old revolutionaries who have experienced the fires of war, as well as young revolutionary rebels who have made achievements during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Some old cadres were previously poisoned by the revisionism of the Chinese Khrushchev, long detached from productive labor and from the workers and peasants. But in this revolutionary furnace of the "May Seventh" Cadres School, they have regained their revolutionary youth. New cadres have also found an inexhaustible source to forever preserve their revolutionary youth. In labor, they wrote magnificent poems: "In the pigsty and sheep pen, we make revolution, with the goal of a red world across five continents and four seas." Because we labor together with the workers and peasants, accept their re-education, and gradually gain their trust, they praise us: "With cadres like you, we are at ease." The poor and lower-middle peasants treat us like brothers and sisters, like family. The Soviet revisionist traitors slander that we are "isolated" from the people and have "lost any connection with the people," which is absurd!

The Soviet revisionist traitor clique has fully restored capitalism within the Soviet Union, turning the proletarian dictatorship into a bourgeois dictatorship. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique is a small clique of representatives of the bourgeois privileged class that oppresses the broad laboring masses of the Soviet Union. They cruelly oppress and exploit the broad laboring masses of the Soviet Union, are bloodsuckers, and overlords riding on the backs of the people. The broad laboring masses of the Soviet Union hate this bunch of traitorous scoundrels to the core. They say: "Here, the leaders and the common people are two classes," "On the basis of the combination of the upper stratum of intellectuals and hereditary intellectuals with the upper stratum of party and government organs that have detached themselves from the people, a ruling clique representing bourgeois interests has been established," "The ruling upper stratum has long ceased to serve the people; it has become a tumor parasitic on the people, strangling the people's neck." It is precisely this small clique of Soviet revisionist traitors who have completely lost contact with the people and are strongly opposed by the broad masses of the Soviet people. Moreover, it will not be long before they will thoroughly cleanse these parasitic tumors from the body.

We study and labor at the "May Seventh" Cadres School. Here, we have the world's largest classroom—the practice of the three great revolutionary movements; the world's best teachers—the workers and peasants; and the world's best textbooks—the four volumes of the golden *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*. We bring the problems we encounter in the three great revolutionary movements, actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, learn from the workers and peasants, and rapidly raise our ideological awareness and skills. Our faces are tanned, and we are covered in mud, but our souls are purer, and our ideological realm is higher. We are determined to blaze a broad avenue of anti-revisionism and preventing revisionism in the wilderness of the Xiaoxinganling Mountains and the banks of the Liuhe River, and ensure that our descendants will forever stride forward on this broad avenue.

Regarding our great initiative of anti-revisionism and preventing revisionism, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique dare not let the broad masses of the Soviet people know about it. They have always been afraid of the truth, desperately blocking the voice of truth, and throwing revolutionaries who dare to resist Soviet rule into madhouses and prisons, turning the Soviet Union into a genuine concentration camp. Every step forward by the Chinese people draws their vicious curses. Their frenzied howls do not harm us in the slightest. We would rather quote the words of a poet that the great revolutionary leader Lenin once quoted in response:

	People slander him with lies,
	But the praise he wants to hear,
	Is not their sweet flattery,
	But their mad curses.

    怒斥苏修叛徒的诬蔑
    黑龙江柳河“五·七”干校战士
    我们黑龙江柳河“五·七”干校关于干部下放劳动的经验发表以后，引起了苏修叛徒集团歇斯底里大发作。苏修喉舌《消息报》大肆攻击我们“五·七”干校是要把“矛头”指向大批党政干部，“完全孤立他们，使他们失去同人民的任何联系”等等。对于苏修叛徒的无耻诬蔑，我们“五·七”干校全体革命战士感到无比的愤慨。
    培养和造就一支什么样的干部队伍，是关系到无产阶级政权掌握在什么人手里的问题。我们伟大领袖毛主席早已英明地指出：“必须坚持干部参加集体生产劳动的制度。我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷。干部通过参加集体生产劳动，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义。”我们遵照毛主席的伟大教导，积极投身阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动，与工农群众打成一片，感到无比的快乐和自豪。干部是一个普通劳动者还是做官当老爷，这是两种对立的社会制度的不同产物。社会主义国家的干部，必须突出无产阶级政治，全心全意为人民服务，紧密地同工农兵结合，做一个普通劳动者；修正主义国家的干部，必然是为一小撮剥削人民和压迫人民的资产阶级特权阶层服务，欺压广大劳动人民，成为骑在人民头上的官老爷。对于革命干部来说，难道有比“普通劳动者”更崇高的称号吗？
    我们“五·七”干校战士，有经历过战争烽火的革命老干部，也有在无产阶级文化大革命中建立了功勋的年青革命造反派。有的老干部过去由于受了中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义的毒害，长期脱离生产劳动，脱离工农群众。但在“五·七”干校这个革命熔炉里，他们恢复了革命的青春。新干部也找到了永葆革命青春的永不枯竭的源泉。他们在劳动中写出了豪迈的诗句：“身在猪舍羊圈闹革命，志在五洲四海一片红。”我们广大革命干部由于同工农群众一起劳动，接受工农的再教育，逐渐取得他们的信任，他们赞誉说：“有了你们这样的干部，我们就放心了”。贫下中农对我们情同手足，亲如一家。苏修叛徒诽谤我们“孤立”于人民之外，“失去同人民的任何联系”，岂不荒唐！
    苏修叛徒集团在苏联国内全面复辟资本主义，把无产阶级专政变成了资产阶级专政。苏修叛徒集团是一小撮压迫苏联广大劳动人民的资产阶级特权阶层代表。他们残酷压迫剥削苏联广大劳动人民，是一群吸血鬼，是骑在人民头上的官老爷。苏联广大劳动人民对这伙工贼叛徒恨之入骨。他们说：“我们这里领导人和普通人是两个阶级”，“在知识分子和世袭知识分子的上层人物同脱离了人民的党政机关的上层人物相结合的基础上，建立了当权的代表资产阶级利益的剥削集团”，“当权的上层集团早已不为人民服务了，它已成为寄生在人民身上的瘤，它掐着人民的脖子”。正是这一小撮苏修叛徒，完全失去了同人民的联系，遭到广大苏联人民的强烈反对。而且不要多久，他们就会把这些寄生的毒瘤从肌体上彻底清除掉。
    我们在“五·七”干校边劳动，边学习。这里有世界上最大的课堂——三大革命运动的实践；有世界上最好的老师——工农群众；有世界上最好的教材——四卷金光闪闪的《毛泽东选集》。我们带着三大革命运动中遇到的问题，活学活用毛泽东思想，向工农群众学习，使我们迅速提高了思想觉悟，增长了才干。我们的脸是晒黑了，滚了一身泥巴，但是我们的灵魂更干净了，思想境界更高了。我们立志要在小兴安岭下、柳河河畔的荒山僻野中踏出一条反修防修的康庄大道，并保证我们的子孙万代永远在这条大道上阔步前进。
    对于我们这个反修、防修的伟大创举，苏修叛徒集团是不敢让苏联广大人民知道的。他们从来害怕真理，拚命封锁真理的声音，并把敢于反抗苏修统治的革命者投进疯人院和监狱，把苏联变成了一座不折不扣的集中营。中国人民每前进一步，都引起他们恶毒的咒骂。这种疯狂的叫骂，无损我们一根毫毛。我们倒想引用伟大革命导师列宁当年曾经引用过的一个诗人的话来作回答：
    人们对他造谣诽谤，
    但是他要听到的赞扬，
    不是他们甜蜜的夸奖，
    正是他们的怒骂如狂。
