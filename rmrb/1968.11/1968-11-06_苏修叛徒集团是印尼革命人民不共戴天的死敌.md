The Soviet revisionist clique, like the U.S. imperialists, is a butcher madly suppressing the Indonesian people's revolutionary struggle, and a mortal enemy of the Indonesian revolutionary people. The Soviet revisionist clique has been doing everything it can to prop up the Indonesian fascist military regime, providing large amounts of money, guns, and "military advisors" to help the Indonesian reactionaries led by Suharto and Nasution suppress the Indonesian people's armed struggle. This has fully exposed the ugly face of this traitorous clique, which waves the banner of socialism while pursuing imperialist policies.

The Soviet revisionist clique, together with U.S. imperialism, has been propping up the Indonesian reactionaries and suppressing the Indonesian people's revolutionary armed struggle. This is a fact known to the world. The Japanese magazine "Military Problems Research" published an article in its July-August double issue this year stating: "The anti-guerrilla forces of the Suharto regime were trained in the Soviet Union, and this has been clearly proven by obvious facts. Moreover, the training expenses were borne by the Soviet Union, which is also well known. Not only that, high-ranking officers of the Soviet army went to East Java to support the anti-guerrilla operations. It was also decided to provide weapons (including aircraft) and ammunition to aid the anti-guerrilla forces." U.S. imperialism and the Indonesian reactionaries have also openly admitted this. The mouthpiece of U.S. monopolies, the "Christian Science Monitor," wrote in a report this September: "Indeed, some Indonesian intelligence officers have hinted to reporters that the Soviet Union has been helpful in eliminating some Indonesian communists."

A large amount of evidence shows that the Soviet revisionist clique is the supplier of guns and cannons for the Indonesian fascist military regime to suppress the Indonesian people's armed struggle, and also the drill sergeant for the Indonesian counter-revolutionary armed forces. The naval commander of the Indonesian fascist regime, Murjadi, admitted in August this year that the Soviet revisionist clique is still continuing to provide military "experts" to the Indonesian reactionary army. He also revealed that "90% of the Indonesian navy uses Soviet-made warships." It is reported that the air force of the Indonesian reactionary regime "has about 350 aircraft, at least half of which are made in Russia." The Japanese bourgeois newspaper "Mainichi Shimbun" revealed in August that the weapons provided by the Soviet revisionist clique to the Indonesian reactionary army include cruisers, destroyers, submarines, MiG fighter jets, bombers, and so on.

It is reported that the aircraft used by the Indonesian reactionaries to conduct counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" of the people's armed forces in West Kalimantan and East Java were all provided by the Soviet revisionists; the weapons used in the "new infantry training" organized by the reactionary military authorities in various provinces of Indonesia to suppress the people's armed forces were jointly provided by the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists. It is reported that the Soviet revisionist clique, in order to make these weapons that slaughter the Indonesian people fully effective, also provided the Indonesian fascist military regime with a large number of weapon parts and "technical guidance" for using these weapons. It is reported that "Soviet technicians and soldiers are still continuing to provide technical guidance in various places in Indonesia."

Since this year, military personnel from the Soviet revisionist clique and U.S. imperialism stationed in Indonesia have gone to the front lines of the fascist military regime's counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" operations three or four times to jointly plot with the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime to suppress the Indonesian people's armed struggle. At the beginning of this year, when the revolutionary people of East Java began armed revolutionary struggles in rural areas, the Soviet revisionist clique immediately sent military officials to East Java to "discuss the possibility of Soviet aid in providing aircraft parts" and other so-called "routine matters" with the local reactionary military authorities. In July and August, when the Indonesian fascist military regime mobilized a large number of troops to conduct counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" of the people's armed forces in East Java and Central Java, military attachés from the Soviet revisionist clique's embassy in Indonesia went to East Java and Central Java to "strengthen friendly relations" and understand the local "security situation." In September, the Soviet military attaché, together with the U.S. military attaché, "visited some military targets in Malang" in East Java under the "escort" of Indonesian reactionary officers.

To help the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime suppress the people's armed forces and prolong the life of this reactionary regime, the Soviet revisionist clique has repeatedly agreed to the delay in repayment of the huge military debt.

In July, when the Indonesian fascist military regime concentrated its forces to "encircle and suppress" the people's armed forces in East Java with Soviet-made weapons, the Soviet revisionist clique's ambassador to Indonesia, Sedyanko, and the foreign minister of the Indonesian fascist military regime, Malik, signed a "certificate of approval" in Jakarta regarding the delay in repayment of Soviet military loans. Malik expressed his gratitude for the Soviet revisionists' "warm concern" on the spot, saying that "agreeing to delay the repayment of the debt means the Soviet Union's great assistance, and also shows (the Soviet Union's) understanding of Indonesia's economy," which makes "Indonesia and the Soviet Union's relationship enter a new chapter."

The Soviet revisionist clique also signed new military aid agreements and contracts with the Indonesian fascist regime. Malik revealed in May that according to these agreements and contracts, the Soviet revisionist clique decided to "sell the parts needed by the Indonesian armed forces" and "bear the expenses of the Indonesian armed forces' trainees currently still in the Soviet Union." Soon after, the Soviet revisionist clique's ambassador to Indonesia, Sedyanko, also publicly stated in Jakarta that "the Soviet government is ready to provide political, economic, and financial aid" to the Indonesian fascist military regime to give it blood and encouragement.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out in his brilliant work "Farewell, Leighton Stuart": "The United States provides money and guns, Chiang Kai-shek provides men, to fight a war for the United States to kill Chinese people and turn China into a U.S. colony, which constitutes an important part of U.S. imperialism's policy of world aggression after the Second World War." Now, the Soviet revisionist clique and U.S. imperialism have joined forces, providing money and guns to slaughter the Indonesian people. The Soviet revisionist clique's barefaced policy of social-imperialist crimes will further promote the awakening of the Indonesian people.

The statement of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party recently said: "The Indonesian people, who are now waging revolutionary armed struggle under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party, are overcoming all difficulties and, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, will definitely smash the plots of Soviet modern revisionism against the Indonesian people, will definitely smash the Suharto-Nasution fascist regime, and will definitely achieve final victory."

    苏修叛徒集团是印尼革命人民不共戴天的死敌
    千方百计出钱出枪出“顾问”，帮助印尼法西斯军人政权镇压印尼人民武装斗争，彻底暴露出苏修打着社会主义旗号、推行帝国主义政策的丑恶面目
    新华社五日讯　本社记者报道：今年以来的大量事实进一步表明：苏修叛徒集团同美帝国主义一样，是疯狂镇压印尼人民革命斗争的刽子手，是印尼革命人民不共戴天的死敌。苏修叛徒集团千方百计地扶植印尼法西斯军人政权，大规模出钱出枪出“军事顾问”，帮助以苏哈托、纳苏蒂安为首的印尼反动派镇压印尼人民武装斗争，彻底暴露了这个叛徒集团打着社会主义旗号、推行帝国主义政策的丑恶面目。
    苏修叛徒集团同美帝国主义一道，扶植印尼反动派，镇压印尼人民革命武装，这已经是全世界众所周知的事实。日本《军事问题研究》杂志在今年七、八月双月刊上发表的一篇文章说：“苏哈托政权的反游击战部队是在苏联接受训练的，这已被明显的事实所证明，同时，由苏联负担了训练的经费，这也是尽人皆知的。不仅如此，苏联军队的高级将领还出差到东爪哇地区支援讨伐游击队的作战。还决定提供反游击队用的武器（包括飞机）、弹药援助。”美帝国主义和印尼反动派对这一点也是直认不讳的。美国垄断资本的喉舌《基督教科学箴言报》今年九月在一篇报道中写道：“的确，印尼的一些情报人员向记者们暗示过，在消灭一些印尼共产党人方面，苏联是有帮助的。”
    大量事实证明，苏修叛徒集团是印尼法西斯军人政权镇压印尼人民武装的枪炮供应者，也是印尼反革命武装的教练官。印尼法西斯政权的海军司令穆尔亚迪今年八月供认，苏修叛徒集团目前正在继续向印尼反动军队提供军事“专家”。他还透露，“印尼海军有百分之九十是使用苏联制造的战舰”。据报道，印尼反动政权的空军“拥有大约三百五十架飞机，其中至少一半是俄国造”。日本资产阶级报纸《每日新闻》八月间透露，苏修叛徒集团向印尼反动军队提供的武器中，包括巡洋舰、驱逐舰、潜水艇、米格战斗机、轰炸机等等。
    据透露，参加对西加里曼丹和东爪哇人民武装进行反革命“围剿”的印尼反动派的飞机都是苏修提供的；印尼各省的反动军事当局主办的、用来镇压人民武装力量的“新型步兵训练”所使用的武器，则是美帝、苏修联合提供的。消息透露，苏修叛徒集团为了使这些屠杀印尼人民的武器充分发挥作用，还向印尼法西斯军人政权提供了大量的武器零件和使用这些武器的“技术指导”。据透露，“苏联的技术人员和军人现在仍继续在（印尼）各地巡回进行技术指导。”
    今年以来，苏修叛徒集团和美帝国主义驻印尼的军事人员，曾三番五次到法西斯军人政权正在进行反革命“围剿”的前线，同苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权联合策划镇压印尼人民武装。今年年初，东爪哇革命人民在农村地区开始了革命的武装斗争，苏修叛徒集团急忙派出军事官员到东爪哇活动，并同当地反动军事当局“讨论了苏联向印尼提供飞机零件的援助的可能性”和一些所谓“例行公事”。七、八月间，正当印尼法西斯军人政权出动大批兵力对东爪哇和中爪哇人民武装进行反革命“围剿”的时候，苏修叛徒集团驻印尼大使馆的武官先后跑到东爪哇和中爪哇，去“加强友好关系”，并了解当地的所谓“治安情况”。九月，苏修武官还伙同美国武官，在印尼反动军官的“陪同”下到东爪哇“参观了玛琅的一些军事目标”。
    为了帮助苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权镇压人民武装，拖长这个反动政权苟延残喘的时日，苏修叛徒集团一再同意这个法西斯政权延期偿还巨额军事债务。
    今年七月，也就是印尼法西斯军人政权集中兵力用苏制武器“围剿”东爪哇人民武装的时候，苏修叛徒集团驻印尼大使塞坚科和印尼法西斯军人政权的外交部长马利克在雅加达签署了关于延期偿还苏修军事贷款的“批准书”。马利克当场感谢苏修的“热情关怀”，说“同意延期偿还债务，这意味着苏联的巨大援助，同时也表现出（苏联）对印尼经济的谅解”，这使“印尼和苏联的关系进入了新的篇章”。
    苏修叛徒集团还同印尼法西斯政权签订了新的军事援助协定和合同。马利克在五月间透露，根据这些协定和合同，苏修叛徒集团决定“向印尼出售武装部队所需要的零件”，并“负担目前还在苏联的印尼武装部队受训人员的经费”。随后不久，苏修叛徒集团驻印尼大使塞坚科还在雅加达公开表示，“苏联政府准备（向印尼）提供政治、经济和财政援助”，以便给印尼法西斯军人政权输血、打气。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席在《别了，司徒雷登》这篇光辉著作中指出：“美国出钱出枪，蒋介石出人，替美国打仗杀中国人，藉以变中国为美国殖民地的战争，组成了美国帝国主义在第二次世界大战以后的世界侵略政策的一个重大的部分。”现在，苏修叛徒集团和美帝国主义结成一伙，出钱出枪，屠杀印尼人民。苏修叛徒集团的这种赤裸裸的社会帝国主义的罪恶政策，必将进一步促进印尼人民的觉醒。
    印度尼西亚共产党中央代表团在最近的声明中说得好：“目前在印度尼西亚共产党领导下进行着革命武装斗争的印度尼西亚人民，正在排除万难，在毛泽东思想的指引下，一定能够粉碎苏联现代修正主义对印度尼西亚人民所进行的阴谋活动，一定能够粉碎苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权，并且一定能够取得最后胜利。”
