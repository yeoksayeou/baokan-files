The Hunan Financial and Commercial College Revolutionary Committee, with the help of the Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, has focused on the fundamentals and actively led teachers and students to study and apply Chairman Mao Zedong's Thought. Through study, the spiritual outlook of individuals and the entire college have been transformed. Many revolutionary teachers and students have voluntarily accepted re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and are determined to thoroughly change their old ideas. The entire college has rapidly launched a high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, November 22, the Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at Hunan Financial and Commercial College has helped the college's Revolutionary Committee focus on the fundamentals, placing the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought at the forefront. They use Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything and have rapidly launched a high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation throughout the college.

After the establishment of the Hunan Financial and Commercial College Revolutionary Committee, during a discussion on the committee's work, some members advocated for dividing responsibilities and seizing a few lines of work, controlling a department's "real power," and not being a "paper committee." The Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team addressed these active thoughts by timely helping the Revolutionary Committee members study Chairman Mao's works and relevant editorials from the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily. They discussed the question of what power the Revolutionary Committee should seize. Through study, everyone's thinking was elevated, and they realized that managing a few seals and issuing a few documents is not the main task of the Revolutionary Committee. The greatest power the Revolutionary Committee should seize is to use Mao Zedong Thought to lead everything. Based on the elevated understanding and unified thinking, the Revolutionary Committee members unanimously decided to place the leadership of the entire college in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and fully implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and more important than everything.

At the same time the college Revolutionary Committee was discussing its work, some revolutionary teachers and students were also offering suggestions to the new Revolutionary Committee and making demands. Some advocated for first rectifying organizational discipline; some advocated for first considering the demotion of cadres and the allocation of students; some advocated for first resolving the contradictions between the two factions of the masses; some advocated for first cleaning up the class ranks, etc. All these suggestions had their own reasons.

The Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team again helped the Revolutionary Committee members analyze the situation of the college and believed that the problems mentioned above are all issues that need to be resolved. Especially the cleaning up of class ranks, which is an important battle in the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, is part of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and must be fought well to lay the foundation for the rectification of the party. They believed that to resolve these problems, it is necessary to organize the masses to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought and fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. Based on the situation within the college, the Worker Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team proposed that the college Revolutionary Committee should focus on the fundamentals and first organize all revolutionary teachers and students to carry out the "Three Loyalty" activity of being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Through this activity, further stimulate everyone's deep proletarian feelings of unlimited love and loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, guide everyone to learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought well. In this way, all revolutionary teachers and students can use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to solve various specific problems and complete various specific tasks.

Through the "Three Loyalty" activity, the deep proletarian feelings of unlimited love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao were greatly stimulated among the broad revolutionary teachers and students. With these deep proletarian feelings, they launched a wave of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. Every morning, all revolutionary teachers and students gather by units in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, wishing Chairman Mao eternal life, singing "The East is Red," and studying Chairman Mao's instructions. "Daily listening" and "daily reading" have become unshakable voluntary actions. Mao Zedong Thought has the highest prestige and the greatest power. Once it is grasped by the masses, it produces boundless power, transforming people's spiritual outlook and the entire college's appearance, bringing about tremendous changes. The original antagonistic sentiments between the two factions have truly been eliminated from the mind; the two factions that were once "irreconcilable" now sit together and have heart-to-heart talks, forming a "red pair." Many revolutionary teachers and students voluntarily accept re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and are determined to thoroughly change their old ideas; activists who are determined to carry out the proletarian educational revolution to the end continue to emerge. Currently, the entire college presents a new atmosphere of unity, tension, seriousness, and liveliness.

    湖南财贸学院革委会在工人宣传队帮助下狠抓根本
    积极领导师生活学活用毛泽东思想
    通过学习，人的精神面貌和整个学院面貌焕然一新。许多革命师生自觉接受工农兵再教育，决心彻底改变旧思想。全院迅速掀起了斗、批、改的高潮
    据新华社长沙二十二日电　进驻湖南财贸学院的工人毛泽东思想宣传队帮助院革命委员会狠抓根本，把活学活用毛泽东思想放在首位，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，在全院迅速掀起了斗、批、改的高潮。
    湖南财贸学院革委会成立后，在研究革委会的工作时，有的成员主张分兵把口，要抓住几条线，掌握一个部门的“实权”，不当“空头委员”。工人毛泽东思想宣传队针对这些活思想，及时帮助革委会成员学习毛主席著作和《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》的有关社论，就革委会究竟要抓什么权的问题展开了一场讨论。通过学习，大家提高了思想，认识到管几颗章子，批几个条子，这不是革委会的主要任务。革委会要掌的最大的权，是用毛泽东思想去领导一切。革委会成员在提高认识、统一思想的基础上，一致决定，把领导全院活学活用毛泽东思想，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示摆在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的位置。
    就在院革委会研究工作的同时，一些革命师生也在为新诞生的革委会出主意，向革委会提要求。有的主张首先抓组织纪律的整顿；有的主张首先抓干部考虑下放，同学考虑分配的活思想；有的主张首先抓彻底解决两派群众之间的矛盾；有的主张首先抓清理阶级队伍，等等，各种各样的主张，各有各的道理。
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队又帮助革委会的同志对学院的情况进行了分析，认为上面提出的这些问题，都是需要解决的。特别是清理阶级队伍，这是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利中的一个重要战役，是毛主席的伟大战略部署，必须把这一仗打好，为整党建党打好基础。他们认为，要解决好这些问题，就必须组织群众活学活用毛泽东思想，全面落实毛主席一系列最新指示。根据学院内的情况，工人毛泽东思想宣传队提出，院革委会狠抓根本，首先要组织全院革命师生开展忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席革命路线的“三忠于”活动，通过这一活动，进一步激发大家对毛主席和毛泽东思想无限热爱、无限忠诚的深厚无产阶级感情，引导大家学好用好毛泽东思想，这样，全院革命师生就能以毛泽东思想为武器，去解决各项具体问题，完成好各项具体任务。
    通过开展“三忠于”活动，大大激发了广大革命师生对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱和无限忠诚的深厚的无产阶级感情。他们怀着这种深厚的无产阶级感情，掀起了活学活用毛泽东思想的热潮。每天清早，全院革命师生按单位分别聚集在毛主席像前，敬祝毛主席万寿无疆，高唱《东方红》，学习毛主席的指示。“天天听”、“天天读”已成为雷打不动的自觉行动。毛泽东思想威信最高，威力最大，一旦掌握了群众，就产生了无穷无尽的力量，使人们的精神面貌和整个学院的面貌焕然一新，发生了巨大的变化。原来两派对立的情绪，真正从思想上消除了；过去“势不两立”的两派群众，现在坐在一起促膝谈心，结成了“一对红”。许多革命师生自觉地接受工农兵的再教育，决心彻底改变旧思想；决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子不断涌现。目前，整个学院出现了一派团结、紧张、严肃、活泼的崭新气象。
