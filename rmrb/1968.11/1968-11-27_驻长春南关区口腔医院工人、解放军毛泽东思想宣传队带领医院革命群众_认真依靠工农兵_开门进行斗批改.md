The workers and the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at Changchun's Nanguan District Dental Hospital have led the revolutionary masses of the hospital to seriously depend on workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation (dou, pi, gai) with an open-door policy.

With the help of workers, peasants, and soldiers, the hospital has reformed unreasonable medical systems and established new regulations. Workers, peasants, and soldiers praised, "This is just like our hospital."

The following is a report:

The workers and the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at Changchun's Nanguan District Dental Hospital have enthusiastically responded to the call of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee's communiqué, followed Mao Zedong's great directive to "seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation," and led the broad revolutionary masses to rely on workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation with an open-door policy, pushing the movement to a new stage.

After the communiqué was issued, the dental hospital quickly launched a wave of studying and implementing the communiqué, and carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. However, how to truly implement the communiqué and push the hospital's struggle, criticism, and transformation to a new height? Just at this time, the hospital received a letter from a soldier who had been treated there. In this letter, the soldier, with a heart full of anger and irrefutable facts, exposed the heinous crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the hospital who fiercely promoted the revisionist medical line and fiercely opposed Mao Zedong's proletarian medical line. The soldier deeply criticized the original dental hospital's revisionist line of looking up but not down, towards the city but not the countryside, towards the bourgeoisie but not the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and put forward a series of rationalization suggestions on how the hospital should carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. This letter attracted the high attention of the workers and the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team. They followed the issues mentioned in the letter that had not been valued by the hospital in the past, reassessed the situation of the hospital's struggle, criticism, and transformation, found the gaps in the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and led the struggle, criticism, and transformation to develop in depth. This incident deeply educated the propaganda team and the broad revolutionary masses of the hospital. They pondered: Why could a soldier propose major issues in the struggle, criticism, and transformation that we had not thought of? With this question in mind, they studied Mao Zedong's teachings on "the masses are the real heroes," deeply feeling that workers, peasants, and soldiers are the most loyal to Mao Zedong, study Mao Zedong Thought the best, understand Mao Zedong's proletarian medical line the deepest, and see problems the most keenly. The hospital should know best how to conform to Mao Zedong's revolutionary medical line.

Subsequently, they linked the actual situation and repeatedly studied Mao Zedong's latest instructions: "The basic principle of the Communist Party is to directly rely on the broad revolutionary masses." They further realized that the main service objects of the hospital are workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the hospital's struggle, criticism, and transformation should serve the needs of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Whatever workers, peasants, and soldiers oppose, it should be thoroughly criticized and reformed; whatever workers, peasants, and soldiers need, it should be firmly established. Therefore, only by relying on workers, peasants, and soldiers and carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation with an open-door policy, can the hospital's struggle, criticism, and transformation be thoroughly carried out.

The dental hospital relied on workers, peasants, and soldiers and carried out the struggle, criticism, and transformation with an open-door policy in the following ways: First, they organized the workers, peasants, and soldiers who came to the hospital for treatment to help the hospital carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. The registration room of this hospital has dozens of people waiting to register every day. Before registration, the registrar first propagandizes the situation of the class struggle and the two-line struggle in the hospital to the registering masses, and then mobilizes the masses to carry out criticism. Second, they invited the workers, peasants, and soldiers who had been treated in the hospital before to help the hospital carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. These people had been treated in the hospital and were relatively familiar with it, helping the hospital to expose many problems that medical staff had not exposed and conducting very profound criticism. This hospital had a reactionary technical "authority" who was always considered a "good person" by some in the hospital. After carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation with an open-door policy, the propaganda team invited a worker who had been treated by him. This worker, upon seeing the reactionary technical "authority," was so angry that his lungs almost burst. He exposed many of his anti-Mao Zedong Thought crimes to his face, making people realize that he was not a "good person" but a "smiling tiger." Third, they actively went out to contact workers, peasants, and soldiers and solicit their opinions on the hospital's struggle, criticism, and transformation. They visited more than fifty times to factories, rural areas, military units, and schools, soliciting more than a hundred opinions. Fourth, they set up suggestion boxes and books for workers, peasants, and soldiers to comment on the hospital's struggle, criticism, and transformation.

The dental hospital absorbed a large number of opinions from workers, peasants, and soldiers, promoting the in-depth development of the struggle, criticism, and transformation. The registration room of this hospital was separated from the patients who came to register by a thick wall, with only a small hole for passing money and numbers. This wall cut off the communication between doctors and patients. The masses angrily said, "Registering at this registration room, you see money but not people, you see numbers but not hearts, it's like two separate families." After carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation with an open-door policy, the masses criticized this registration room sharply, helping medical staff to realize the danger of being detached from the masses. Medical staff immediately removed the wall and registered face-to-face with patients at the same table, and the masses reacted positively.

The dental hospital, according to the masses' requirements, thoroughly reformed all unreasonable regulations. In the past, coming to the dental hospital for dental implants, it took three days to register, ten days to extract teeth, fifteen days to bite a dental impression, and sixty days to implant teeth. The masses were very dissatisfied with this old regulation. In the process of carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation with an open-door policy, the revolutionary staff of the hospital listened to the opinions of workers, peasants, and soldiers, broke this old regulation, and now it takes only one day to register, one day to see a doctor, and one week to implant teeth.

With the help of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, the dental hospital's struggle, criticism, and transformation is surging higher and higher. They established new regulations to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers according to their needs. Workers, peasants, and soldiers enthusiastically praised, "If hospitals all carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation like the dental hospital, that would be great, it would be just like our hospital."

Now, under the guidance of Mao Zedong's proletarian medical line, more and more workers, peasants, and soldiers are concerned about and participating in the hospital's struggle, criticism, and transformation. The hospital's struggle, criticism, and transformation is becoming more and more extensive, and the steps are becoming bigger and bigger.

    驻长春南关区口腔医院工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队带领医院革命群众
    认真依靠工农兵　开门进行斗批改
    在工农兵的帮助下，改革了不合理的医疗制度，建立了新的规章制度。工农兵赞扬说：“这就象我们的医院了。”
    本报讯　驻长春市南关区口腔医院工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队，热烈响应党的八届十二中全会公报的号召，遵照毛主席“认真搞好斗、批、改”的伟大教导，带领广大革命群众，依靠工农兵，开门搞斗、批、改，把斗、批、改运动推向了一个新阶段。
    全会公报发表后，口腔医院迅速掀起一个学习公报、落实公报，搞好斗、批、改的热潮。但是怎样才能使公报真正落实，把医院斗、批、改推向一个新高潮呢？正在这时，医院收到一位曾在本院治过病的解放军战士的来信。在这封信里，这个战士以满腔愤怒的心情和无可辩驳的事实，揭露了刘少奇及其在口腔医院的代理人拚命推行修正主义医疗路线，疯狂对抗毛主席无产阶级医疗路线的滔天罪行，深刻批判了原口腔医院向上不向下，向城市不向农村，向资产阶级不向工农兵的修正主义路线，并就医院如何搞好斗、批、改的问题，提出了一系列合理化建议。这封信引起了工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的高度重视。他们按照信中提到的一些过去没有被医院重视的重大问题，对医院斗、批、改形势，重新作了估价，找到了斗、批、改的差距，把斗、批、改引向纵深发展。这件事深深教育了宣传队和医院广大革命群众。他们琢磨：一个解放军战士为什么能够提出我们想不到的斗、批、改中的重大问题呢？他们带着这个问题学习了毛主席关于“群众是真正的英雄”的教导，深深感到：工农兵对毛主席最忠，学习毛泽东思想最好，对毛主席的无产阶级医疗路线理解得最深，看问题最敏锐。医院怎样才能符合毛主席的革命医疗路线，他们心中最有数。
    接着，他们又联系实际，反复学习了毛主席的最新指示：“共产党基本的一条，就是直接依靠广大革命人民群众。”进一步认识到：医院服务的主要对象是工农兵，医院的斗、批、改，应该服从工农兵的需要。凡是工农兵反对的，就要大破大改，凡是工农兵需要的，就要大树大立。因此，只有依靠工农兵，开门搞斗、批、改，才能把医院的斗、批、改搞彻底。
    口腔医院依靠工农兵，开门搞斗、批、改是这样做的：第一，他们把前来看病的工农兵组织起来，帮助医院开展斗、批、改。这个医院的挂号室，每天都有数十人在这里等候挂号。挂号前，挂号员首先把医院两个阶级和两条路线斗争情况，向挂号的群众做宣传，然后发动群众开展批判。第二，他们把过去在本院看过病的工农兵请回来，帮助医院开展斗、批、改。这些人受过医院治疗，对医院比较了解，帮助医院揭发了很多医护人员没有揭发出来的问题，并做了极其深刻的批判。这个医院有一名反动技术“权威”，过去在院里一直被有些人认为是“老好人”。开门搞斗、批、改之后，宣传队请来了被他治过病的一个工人，这个工人一见这个反动技术“权威”，肺都要气炸了，当面揭发了他很多反毛泽东思想的罪行。这就使人们认清了他原来不是什么“老好人”，而是个“笑面虎”。第三，他们主动走出去，接触工农兵，征求工农兵对医院斗、批、改的意见。他们先后到工厂、农村、部队、学校访问了五十多次，征求了上百条意见。第四，设立了工农兵对医院斗、批、改的意见箱和意见簿。
    口腔医院吸收了工农兵对斗、批、改的大量意见，推动了斗、批、改的深入发展。这个医院的挂号室，同前来医院挂号群众之间隔着一道厚厚的墙，只有一孔之通，递钱传号。这道墙隔绝了医生和患者之间的联系。群众气愤地说：“到这个挂号室挂号，见钱不见人，见号不见心，内外两家人。”开门搞斗、批、改以后，群众对这个挂号室提出了尖锐的批评，帮助医护人员认识到了脱离群众的危险。医护人员立即扒掉了隔墙，同患者在一个桌子上对面挂号，群众反映很好。
    口腔医院按照群众的要求，对一切不合理的规章制度作了彻底的改革。过去来口腔医院镶牙，三天挂号，十天拔牙，十五天咬个牙印，六十天镶个牙。对这种旧规章制度群众很不满意。在开门搞斗批改的过程中，医院革命职工听取了工农兵的意见，打破了这个旧制度，现在是当天挂号，当天看，镶牙只用一周时间。
    口腔医院在广大工农兵的帮助下，斗、批、改一浪高一浪。他们按照工农兵的需要，建立了为工农兵服务的新的规章制度。工农兵热情赞扬说：“医院要都象口腔医院这样搞斗、批、改，那就好了，就象我们的医院了。”
    现在，口腔医院在毛主席无产阶级医疗路线的指引下，关心和参加医院斗、批、改的工农兵越来越多，医院斗、批、改的路子越走越宽，步子越迈越大。
