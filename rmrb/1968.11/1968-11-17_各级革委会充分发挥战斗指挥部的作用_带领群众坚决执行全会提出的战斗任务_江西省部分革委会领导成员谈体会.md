In the great inspiration of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the revolutionary committees at all levels in Jiangxi Province have led the 22 million children of Jinggangshan to high up the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely united around the headquarters of the proletarian revolution led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, resolutely carrying out the various great combat tasks proposed by the plenum, and fully playing the role of battle command posts. At a recent enlarged fifth meeting of the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee, many leaders of the revolutionary committees introduced the situation and experiences in this regard.

**Overthrowing the Reactionary "Multi-Center" Theory of the Bourgeoisie, Following the Great Leader Chairman Mao Forward Bravely**

Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee Chairman Cheng Shiqing said:

Under the combat order of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the revolutionary committees at all levels in Jiangxi Province are leading the heroic children of Jinggangshan with a hundredfold confidence and high fighting spirit, earnestly propagating and studying the communiqué of the plenum, resolutely carrying out the various combat tasks proposed by the plenum, and striving for the overall victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "All comrades in the Party must unite around the Central Committee. Any act that disrupts unity is a crime." In carrying out the various great combat tasks proposed by the plenum, we have reviewed Chairman Mao's great teaching, deeply realizing that closely uniting around the headquarters of the proletarian revolution led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, further carrying out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, earnestly carrying out Chairman Mao's every new directive and the combat orders of the headquarters of the proletarian revolution, is the fundamental guarantee for the revolutionary committees to lead the broad masses of the people to realize the combat tasks proposed by the plenum.

"One thousand conditions, ten thousand conditions, listening to Chairman Mao's words is the first condition; a thousand important things, ten thousand important things, uniting around the headquarters of the proletarian revolution is the most important." This is the practical experience of the people of the old revolutionary base in Jiangxi Province following Chairman Mao in revolution for more than forty years, from victory to victory. In those days, Chairman Mao came to Jinggangshan and led the workers and peasants to establish the first revolutionary base in the country. From then on, the people of Jiangxi had only Chairman Mao in their hearts. Whatever Chairman Mao said, we did; wherever Chairman Mao pointed, we fought. In this Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, we followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "carrying forward the revolutionary tradition and striving for greater glory," closely uniting around the headquarters of the proletarian revolution led by Chairman Mao, under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unifying our understanding, unifying our steps, and unifying our actions, we successfully smashed the stubborn stronghold of Liu Shaoqi in Jiangxi and won the decisive victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. This struggle practice made us understand that the headquarters of the proletarian revolution led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin most concentratedly represents the fundamental interests of the working class, poor and lower-middle peasants, and the broad revolutionary masses, and is the only correct highest command post leading the proletariat and revolutionary people in revolutionary struggles.

Therefore, to implement the various combat tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, we especially need to be absolutely loyal to the headquarters of the proletarian revolution led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and further carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. We must thoroughly overthrow the reactionary "multi-center" theory of the bourgeoisie, eliminate all kinds of interference, and for every combat order issued by the headquarters of the proletarian revolution, we must strive to study and resolutely carry it out. We must carry out what we understand and also carry out what we do not understand temporarily, deepening our understanding in the process of carrying it out. We must carry forward the revolutionary academic style that Chairman Mao has always advocated, establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and apply what we learn from the communiqué of the plenum, learning a little and applying a little, focusing on the "application" and putting all our actions into the revolutionary track of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, putting all revolutionary forces into realizing the combat tasks proposed by the plenum. As long as we do this, we will surely win the overall victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

**Carrying Forward the Spirit of Continuous Revolution, Launching a Greater Battle**

The leaders of the Pingxiang Mining Bureau Revolutionary Committee, Li Kaoli and Zhang Hongdi, said:

When we discussed how to lead the masses to realize the various combat tasks proposed by the plenum, we studied Chairman Mao's teaching: "Because of victory, the mood of arrogance in the Party, the mood of self-congratulation, the mood of stagnation and not seeking progress, the mood of indulging in enjoyment and not wanting to live a hard life, may grow." We used Chairman Mao's teaching to examine ourselves and felt that this is a very important issue at present. Some of our comrades only see the great victories that have been achieved and, in the midst of praise, unknowingly become complacent. Why is this? Ultimately, it is because we do not fully understand the great significance of this Cultural Revolution of the proletariat under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and have not seen or fully seen the depth, thoroughness, and arduousness of this political revolution against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. We seriously discussed this issue, thoroughly criticized and purged all stagnant moods, and unanimously realized that the revolutionary committee must lead the masses well to realize the various combat tasks proposed by the plenum, and must establish the spirit of continuous and thorough revolution of the proletariat. We have already achieved extremely great victories, but we should regard this as only "the first step of the Long March of ten thousand li." In this way, our momentum to move forward will be even greater, and our revolutionary spirit will be even more invigorated.

The Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party is a mobilization meeting for winning the overall victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. Under the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the revolutionary situation is developing rapidly. Our mine is located in the revolutionary tradition-rich red Anshan. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, establish the continuous revolutionary ideology of the proletariat among the broad masses, lead the masses to advance bravely, and strive for the victory of realizing the various combat tasks proposed by the plenum.

**Deepening the Revolutionary Criticism, Grabbing Class Struggle Without Relaxation**

The leader of the Xingguo County Revolutionary Committee, Zhang Fengxuan, said:

The communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party points out: "Against the sabotage activities of the exploiting classes and their agents, we must continue to be vigilant." We have seriously studied this directive and examined ourselves, realizing that, as the great leader Chairman Mao points out: "All reactionary forces, when they are about to perish, will definitely struggle desperately." Realizing the combat tasks proposed by the plenum and winning the overall victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat will inevitably encounter the desperate counterattack of a handful of class enemies and will inevitably be a fierce class struggle. Therefore, we must always, everywhere, and in everything grab class struggle without relaxation. We helped some comrades overcome the complacency and underestimation of the enemy, and the members of the revolutionary committee all went to the front line, together with the revolutionary masses, pushing the revolutionary criticism of the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi to a new high tide, and at the same time, together with the revolutionary masses, analyzing and grasping the new trends of class struggle, and smashing the new counterattacks of the class enemies at any time. We targeted the phenomenon that some units currently do not criticize the class enemies that have been investigated enough, and held a meeting in Changgang Commune to promote the experience of this commune in closely combining revolutionary criticism with strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat, raising the revolutionary criticism in the whole county to a new level. Now, when denouncing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary crimes in various places in the county, attention is paid to closely combining with the actual struggle of the unit, making the revolutionary criticism targeted and convincing, criticizing thoroughly and deeply. In the future, we will resolutely lead the broad revolutionary masses of Xingguo County, firmly grasp the key of class struggle, comprehensively implement the various combat tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, and win the overall victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

**Directly Relying on the Broad Masses of the People, Winning the Overall Victory of the Cultural Revolution**

The leader of the Ganzhou Special District Revolutionary Committee, Liu Yun, said:

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary war is the war of the masses. Only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, and only by relying on the masses can we wage war." "The basic principle of the Communist Party is to directly rely on the broad revolutionary masses of the people." The revolutionary committee must realize the combat tasks proposed by the plenum, and must mobilize the masses most extensively and rely on the broad masses of the people most directly. And to mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, we must first maintain close contact with the masses. Under the great inspiration of the communiqué of the plenum, we in the Ganzhou Special District Revolutionary Committee, in order to further strengthen our contact with the masses, recently, with the deepest proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, carried out an open rectification. In the process of rectification, everyone talked about the situation, set tasks, found gaps, and unanimously agreed that to lead the masses to win the overall victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, an important condition is that all the staff of the revolutionary committee must further break the old habits and styles of the old organs, firmly establish a new style of closely contacting the masses, making the revolutionary committee deeply rooted among the masses. To this end, everyone formulated the following specific measures: regularly have half to two-thirds of the standing committee members lead the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to go deep into the grassroots to conduct investigations and research, and stay for no less than half a month each time, and live, study, work, and fight with the poor and lower-middle peasants and workers; the standing committee members who stay at home participate in labor with the masses every Saturday, and work at the people's reception station for one day every month, personally receiving the visiting masses; the standing committee members participate in the democratic life of the masses, often carry out criticism and self-criticism, and actively accept the criticism and supervision of the masses. At the same time, everyone also proposed that to better contact the masses, we must fully play the role of the revolutionary masses' representatives in the three-in-one power structure, respect their opinions, and learn from their daring to think, daring to do, and vigorous revolutionary spirit and excellent style of closely contacting the masses. We recently also selected a batch of outstanding fighters from the revolutionary rebels from the industrial workers and grassroots cadres to supplement the revolutionary committee. This batch of new forces has long fought on the front line of the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, and has long lived among the workers and peasants, having a close connection with the broad masses. They came to the revolutionary committee, making the revolutionary committee more closely connected with the masses, greatly enhancing the fighting strength of the revolutionary committee, and thus ensuring that the revolutionary committee plays the role of the battle command post better in leading the masses to realize the various tasks proposed by the communiqué of the plenum.

　　各级革委会充分发挥战斗指挥部的作用
　　带领群众坚决执行全会提出的战斗任务
　　——江西省部分革委会领导成员谈体会
    新华社南昌十六日电　在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的巨大鼓舞下，江西省各级革命委员会带领二千二百万井冈山儿女，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧紧团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，坚决执行全会提出的各项伟大战斗任务，充分发挥了战斗指挥部的作用。最近举行的江西省革命委员会第五次扩大会议上，许多革委会的领导成员介绍了这方面的情况和体会。
    批倒资产阶级反动的“多中心论”，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席奋勇前进
    江西省革委会主任程世清说：
    在党的八届扩大的十二中全会的战斗号令下，江西省各级革委会正率领英雄的井冈山儿女，以百倍的信心，昂扬的斗志，认真宣传、学习全会的公报，坚决执行全会提出的各项战斗任务，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“全党同志必须团结在中央的周围，任何破坏团结的行为都是罪恶”。在执行全会提出的各项伟大战斗任务的时候，我们重温了毛主席的这一伟大教导，深刻认识到，紧密团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，进一步开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，认真执行毛主席的每项最新指示和无产阶级司令部的每个战斗号令，是革命委员会率领广大人民群众实现全会提出的战斗任务的根本保证。
      “一千条，一万条，听毛主席的话是第一条；千重要，万重要，团结在无产阶级司令部的周围最重要。”这就是四十多年来江西革命老根据地人民紧跟毛主席干革命，从胜利走向胜利的切身体验。当年，毛主席来到井冈山，领导工农群众建立了全国第一个革命根据地。从那时起，江西人民心中就只有毛主席。毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么干，毛主席指向那里，我们就打到那里。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，我们遵照毛主席“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的教导，紧紧地团结在以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部周围，在毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下，统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，胜利地摧毁了刘少奇在江西的顽固堡垒，夺得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。这一斗争实践，更使我们懂得，以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，最集中地代表了工人阶级、贫下中农和广大革命群众的根本利益，是领导无产阶级和革命人民进行革命斗争的唯一正确的最高指挥部。
    因此，要贯彻落实八届十二中全会提出的各项战斗任务，特别需要我们对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的无限忠诚，需要进一步开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。我们要彻底批倒资产阶级反动的“多中心论”，排除各种干扰，对无产阶级司令部发出的每一个战斗号令，一定要努力学习，坚决照办，彻底执行。理解的要执行，暂时不理解的也要执行，在执行的过程中加深理解。我们要发扬毛主席历来倡导的理论联系实际的革命学风，大办毛泽东思想学习班，对全会公报学了就用，学一点用一点，在“用”字上狠下功夫，把一言一行都纳入毛主席无产阶级革命路线的革命轨道，把一切革命力量都用到实现全会提出的战斗任务上去。只要我们这样做，就一定能夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    发扬不断革命精神，展开更伟大的战斗
    萍乡矿务局革委会主任李开碌、副主任张洪迪说：
    我们矿革委会在讨论如何率领群众去实现全会提出的各项战斗任务的时候，学习了毛主席的教导：“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。”我们用毛主席这一教导对照检查自己，觉得这在当前是一个极其重要的问题。我们有的同志，只看到已经取得的伟大胜利，在一片赞扬声中，不知不觉地就满足起来。为什么会这样？归根到底，还是对这场无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义认识不足，没有看到或者没有充分看到，这场在无产阶级专政下反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命的深刻性、彻底性和艰巨性。我们认真地讨论了这个问题，彻底地批判和肃清了一切停滞不前的情绪。一致认识到，革委会要很好地带领群众实现全会提出的各项战斗任务，必须树立无产阶级的不断革命和彻底革命精神。我们已经取得了极其伟大的胜利，但是我们应当把它看成这只是“万里长征走完了第一步”，这样，我们前进的劲头就会鼓得更足，革命的精神也就更加振奋了。
    党的八届十二中全会是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的动员会。在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，革命形势正在迅猛发展。我们矿是富有革命传统的红色安源的所在地。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在广大群众中大立无产阶级的不断革命思想，带领群众奋勇前进，为胜利实现全会提出的各项战斗任务而奋斗。
    深入开展革命大批判，狠抓阶级斗争不转向
    兴国县革委会主任张凤选说：
    党的八届十二中全会公报指出：“对于剥削阶级及其代理人的破坏活动，必须继续提高警惕。”我们认真学习了这一指示，并对照进行了检查，认识到，正如伟大领袖毛主席指出的：“一切反动势力在他们行将灭亡的时候，总是要进行垂死挣扎的。”实现全会提出的战斗任务，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，必然要遭到一小撮阶级敌人的疯狂反扑，必然是一场激烈的阶级斗争。因此，我们必须时时、处处、事事狠抓阶级斗争不转向。我们帮助一些同志克服了麻痹轻敌的思想，革委会成员都深入第一线，和革命群众一起把对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的革命大批判推向一个新的高潮，同时和革命群众一起分析、掌握阶级斗争的新动向，随时粉碎阶级敌人的新反扑。我们针对少数单位目前对清查出来的阶级敌人批得不够的现象，在长冈公社召开了现场会，推广了这个公社把革命大批判和加强无产阶级专政紧密结合起来的经验，使全县革命大批判又提高到了一个新的水平。现在，全县各地在声讨刘少奇的反革命罪行时，都注意紧密结合本单位的斗争实际，使革命大批判做到针对性强，说服力强，批得狠，批得深。今后，我们决心带领兴国县广大革命群众，紧紧抓住阶级斗争这条纲，全面落实八届十二中全会提出的各项战斗任务，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    直接地依靠广大人民群众，夺取文化大革命全面胜利
    赣州专区革委会主任刘云说：
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”“共产党基本的一条，就是直接依靠广大革命人民群众。”革委会要实现全会提出的战斗任务，就必须最广泛地发动群众，最直接地依靠广大群众。而要动员群众，依靠群众，首先必须与群众保持密切的联系。在全会公报的巨大鼓舞下，我们赣州专区革委会为了进一步密切与群众的联系，最近怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无比深厚的无产阶级感情，进行了一次开门整风。在整风过程中，大家谈形势，摆任务，找差距，一致认为要带领群众夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，很重要的一条就是革委会的全体工作人员，要进一步打破旧机关的旧习惯、旧作风，牢固树立起崭新的密切联系群众的新作风，使革委会深深扎根于群众之中。为此，大家制定了这样一些具体措施：经常有二分之一至三分之二的常委分别带领毛泽东思想宣传队，深入基层搞调查研究，下去一次不得少于半个月，并且与贫下中农、工人同吃、同住、同学习、同劳动、同战斗；留在家里的常委每星期六自觉和群众一起参加劳动，每月到群众接待站值班一天，亲自接待来访群众；常委分别参加群众的民主生活，经常开展批评与自我批评，主动接受群众的批评监督。同时，大家还提出，要更好地联系群众，还必须充分发挥三结合权力机构中革命群众代表的作用，尊重他们的意见，学习他们敢想、敢干、朝气蓬勃的革命精神和密切联系群众的优良作风。我们最近还从产业工人和基层干部中选拔了一批革命造反派的优秀战士充实到革委会中来。这批新生力量长期战斗在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动的第一线，长期生活在工农群众之中，与广大群众有着密切的联系。他们到革委会中来，使革委会更加密切了与群众的联系，大大增强了革委会的战斗力，从而保证了革委会在带领群众实现全会公报提出的各项任务中，更好地发挥了战斗指挥部的作用。
