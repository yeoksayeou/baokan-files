The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued the following statement on November 16:

	New China News Agency, Hanoi, November 17: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued the following statement on November 16:

	The spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam responds to the statement made by the spokesperson of the U.S. Department of State on behalf of the Acting U.S. Secretary of State on November 13, 1968, as follows:

	1. Regarding the issue of representatives at the upcoming conference to discuss the resolution of the Vietnam problem, the representative of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam participating in the formal dialogue in Paris has already rejected the U.S. representative's proposal for a bilateral meeting where "both sides will organize themselves as they choose." After the U.S. unconditionally stops all bombing and other acts of war against the entire territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam clarified in its statement on November 2: "In agreement with the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam declares its readiness at any time to participate in a conference including representatives of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the United States, and the Saigon regime. The participation of the Saigon regime in this conference does not imply recognition of this regime by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam."

	The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam once again stresses: The current Saigon regime is a tool used by U.S. imperialism to wage aggression in South Vietnam and to impose neo-colonialism. This regime does not represent anyone. The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is the organizer and leader of the South Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. It is the true representative of the South Vietnamese people and has the full authority to resolve all issues related to South Vietnam. A conference aimed at resolving the Vietnam problem must include the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam as an equal and independent party, just like the other parties.

	2. The U.S. Department of State announced that the U.S. is continuing reconnaissance activities in the airspace of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam "as needed." This means that the U.S. is granting itself the right to violate the sovereignty, territory, and security of an independent sovereign state—the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This is the arrogant and unreasonable argument of an aggressor, trampling on the 1954 Geneva Agreements on Vietnam and international law, and is a serious provocation to world opinion and U.S. public opinion.

	Over the past few years and during the formal dialogue in Paris, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently demanded that the U.S. must unconditionally stop bombing and all other acts of war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. After the U.S. unconditionally stopped bombing and attacking the entire territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam with its air force, navy, and artillery, on November 2, 1968, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam once again firmly demanded that the U.S. must stop its war of aggression against Vietnam and must permanently abandon all actions that violate the sovereignty and security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The U.S. Department of State's stance on this issue further exposes the aggressive and obstinate nature of the U.S. rulers.

	3. Regarding the so-called "military actions in or near the demilitarized zone and indiscriminate attacks on major cities in the South," the U.S. once again deliberately uses ambiguous language to try to make public opinion believe that the cessation of bombing and attacks on the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is based on certain conditions. This is a very cunning tactic by the U.S. The consistent position of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is to demand that the U.S. must unconditionally stop bombing and all other acts of war against the entire territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. After the formal dialogue in Paris reached a stalemate for five months, the U.S. government representative was forced to explain to the representative of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam that the U.S. cessation of bombing and attacks on the entire territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was unconditional.

	Over the past fourteen years, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently respected the 1954 Geneva Agreements on Vietnam, including the demilitarized zone, while the U.S. has systematically and completely violated this agreement. Even after the U.S. unconditionally stopped bombing and attacking the entire territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the U.S. continued to violate the Geneva Agreements, attacking the demilitarized zone on November 4, 6, and 13, 1968.

	The U.S. has sent more than 500,000 expeditionary forces to invade South Vietnam, along with more than 500,000 puppet troops and mercenary forces. The U.S. has used its air force, navy, artillery, and many modern weapons to brutally massacre the people of South Vietnamese villages and cities. Since the U.S. stopped bombing North Vietnam, the U.S. has further intensified its sweeps, heavy bombing, and attacks, killing South Vietnamese compatriots. The people of South Vietnam and the liberation armed forces are fighting fiercely against the U.S. imperialist aggressors. They have the right to take all necessary measures to counterattack the U.S. aggressors on any part of South Vietnamese territory. This is the inviolable right of self-defense of the South Vietnamese people. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam fully supports this sacred right of the South Vietnamese compatriots. As long as the U.S. continues to invade South Vietnam, the South Vietnamese people will fight to the end, achieving a complete victory to realize an independent, democratic, peaceful, neutral, and prosperous South Vietnam, and then peacefully reunify the Vietnamese homeland.

	The U.S.'s cunning arguments aim to justify its strengthening of the war of aggression against South Vietnam, continuing attacks on the demilitarized zone, and the daily intrusion of its aircraft into the sovereignty and security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. At the same time, they are intended to shift the blame for delaying the start of the Paris talks aimed at a political solution to the Vietnam problem.

	The Democratic Republic of Vietnam firmly rejects the blatant distortions of the U.S. on November 13, 1968. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam reaffirms its position stated in the November 2, 1968, statement. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam demands that the U.S. government must abandon all delaying tactics and ensure that the Paris talks on the Vietnam problem begin as soon as possible.

	November 16, 1968

### 越南民主共和国外交部十一月十六日的声明

　　越南民主共和国外交部十一月十六日的声明
    新华社河内十七日电　据越南通讯社报道，越南民主共和国外交部发言人十六日发表一项声明如下：
    越南民主共和国外交部发言人就一九六八年十一月十三日美国国务院发言人以美国代理国务卿的名义所发表的声明作如下声明：
    一、关于在即将举行的讨论解决越南问题的会议的代表问题，参加巴黎正式对话的越南民主共和国代表，已驳斥了美国代表关于“双方将按照它们的选择自行组织”的双边会议的建议。在美国无条件地停止对越南民主共和国全部领土的轰炸和其它一切战争行动之后，越南民主共和国政府在十一月二日的声明中已经阐明：“在同越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会取得一致意见的情况下，越南民主共和国政府宣布随时准备参加包括越南民主共和国代表、越南南方民族解放阵线代表、美国代表和西贡政权代表的会议。西贡政权代表参加这次会议，并不意味着越南民主共和国方面承认这个政权。”
    越南民主共和国政府再一次强调指出：目前的西贡政权是美帝国主义用来在越南南方进行侵略战争和推行新殖民主义的工具，这个政权代表不了任何人。越南南方民族解放阵线是越南南方人民抗美救国的组织者和领导者，是越南南方人民的真正代表，具有充分的权威解决同越南南方有关的各项问题。一个旨在解决越南问题的会议，必须有越南南方民族解放阵线作为同其它各方一样具有平等和独立的一方的资格参加。
    二、美国国务院宣布说，美国在越南民主共和国的领空“正根据需要继续侦察活动”，这就意味着，美国授予自己侵犯一个独立的主权国家——越南民主共和国的主权、领土和安全的权力。这是侵略者的蛮横无理的论调，践踏了一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议和国际法，是对世界舆论和美国舆论的严重挑衅。
    过去几年中和在巴黎的正式对话中，越南民主共和国方面坚决要求美国必须无条件地停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸和其他一切战争行动。在美国无条件地停止用空军、海军、炮兵对越南民主共和国全部领土的轰炸和袭击后，一九六八年十一月二日，越南民主共和国政府再次坚决要求美国必须停止侵略越南的战争，必须永远放弃一切侵犯越南民主共和国主权和安全的行动。美国国务院在这一问题上的论调更加暴露了美国当权者的侵略和顽固的面目。
    三、关于所谓“在非军事区或非军事区附近的军事行动和对南方主要城市的不分青红皂白的袭击”，美国再次蓄意用含糊其词的语言，以图使舆论相信停止轰炸、袭击越南民主共和国是根据某些条件达成协议的。这是美国方面的极其狡诈的手段。越南民主共和国政府始终如一的立场是，要求美国必须在越南民主共和国全部领土上无条件地停止轰炸和其他一切战争行动。在巴黎正式对话陷入僵局五个月之后，美国政府代表被迫向越南民主共和国政府代表说明，美国停止对越南民主共和国全部领土的轰炸、袭击是无条件的。
    在过去十四年中，越南民主共和国政府一贯尊重一九五四年关于越南问题、其中包括非军事区的日内瓦协议，而美国却有系统地、全部地违反了这一协议。就在美国无条件地停止对越南民主共和国全部领土的轰炸和袭击以后，美国仍然继续违反日内瓦协议，在一九六八年十一月四日、六日和十三日袭击了非军事区。
    美国派遣了五十多万远征军同五十多万伪军及帮凶军一起侵略越南南方。美国使用了空军、海军、炮兵和许多现代化武器极其野蛮地屠杀越南南方农村和城市的人民。自从美国停止对越南北方的轰炸和袭击以后，美国进一步加强了扫荡，进行剧烈的轰炸和袭击，残杀越南南方同胞。越南南方人民和解放武装力量正在为反对美帝国主义侵略者进行着激烈的战斗，他们有权在越南南方领土上的任何地方采取一切办法反击美国侵略者。这是越南南方人民不可侵犯的自卫权力。越南民主共和国政府彻底支持越南南方同胞的这一神圣权力。只要美国还侵略越南南方，越南南方人民就要战斗到彻底胜利，以实现一个独立、民主、和平、中立和繁荣的越南南方，进而和平统一越南祖国。
    美国的这些狡诈的论调，旨在为它正在强化侵略越南南方的战争，继续袭击非军事区和每天派遣飞机侵犯越南民主共和国主权和安全的非正义行动进行辩护，同时是为了推卸它拖延举行谋求政治解决越南问题的巴黎会谈的责任。
    越南民主共和国方面坚决驳斥美国一九六八年十一月十三日明目张胆的歪曲论调。越南民主共和国政府重申它一九六八年十一月二日声明的立场。越南民主共和国政府要求美国政府必须放弃一切拖延手段，使关于越南问题的巴黎会谈早日开始。
                      一九六八年十一月十六日
