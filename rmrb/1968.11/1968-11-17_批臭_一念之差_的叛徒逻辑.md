One of the most prominent traitors in the Chinese revolution, Liu Shaoqi, has repeatedly knelt before the reactionary forces of the Kuomintang and imperialism, betraying the revolution to save his own skin.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Communist Party members should be the most far-sighted and self-sacrificing," "in times of difficulty, they should remain steadfast and work loyally for the nation, the class, and the party." When the revolution calls, communists should "offer their lives for our cause." However, Liu Shaoqi shamelessly betrays Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, vigorously promoting a revisionist and capitulationist political line, and concocting a whole set of traitorous philosophies to provide "theoretical" justification for traitors. The so-called "a moment's hesitation" is one of these. This is a thoroughly reactionary logic that defends traitors.

True proletarian revolutionaries and steadfast communists have only one ideal: to dedicate themselves to the realization of communism, to work tirelessly and die in the process. Therefore, they do not retreat in the face of gunfire, and they remain calm when facing execution. Look at the internationalist hero Huang Jiguang, who, to support the world revolution, resolutely used his body to block the enemy's gunfire. Look at the good cadre Meng Hetong, who, while helping the masses set up a land mine, was blown up by an accidental explosion, sacrificing his life to protect his comrades. These heroes' brave deeds—are they just "a thought" or "a moment's hesitation"? No! The heroes' actions and thoughts come from the excellent qualities of the proletariat and the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. These proletarian revolutionaries, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, dedicate themselves to the revolution and to the people. Personal safety is never a concern for them. Their communist worldview is firmly established, so they can face danger without fear and face death with composure.

As for the traitor Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices, they have never been true revolutionaries but opportunists who infiltrated the revolutionary ranks. Their betrayal of the revolution is not due to "a thought" or "a moment's hesitation," but rather the complete exposure of their counter-revolutionary nature. Imagine, when Liu Shaoqi repeatedly knelt before the reactionary forces of the Kuomintang and imperialism, was it due to "a thought" or "a moment's hesitation"? No, absolutely not! They are the sons and grandsons of the bourgeoisie and landlords, always the running dogs of the Kuomintang reactionaries and imperialism. They have never had a bit of proletarian revolutionary spirit. Their minds are always filled with thoughts of "loving oneself" and "protecting one's head." When faced with difficulties, they inevitably betray the revolution and the people. In short, all these evil deeds come from their counter-revolutionary class nature and their deep hatred for the proletarian revolutionary cause. The reactionary fallacy of "a moment's hesitation" can never cover up their deeply rooted counter-revolutionary stance.

Liu Shaoqi desperately promotes the reactionary fallacy of "a moment's hesitation," actually trying to exonerate himself and all traitors. Under the cover of this fallacy, this great traitor, great spy, and great saboteur, along with his accomplices, have long been hiding, stirring up trouble, and continuing their evil deeds. The "a moment's hesitation" that Liu Shaoqi advocates is also a sedative. With this set of flowery words, he promotes the theory of the "extinction of class struggle," numbing the revolutionary spirit of the people, and attempting to use this to escape the struggle of the revolutionary people, hiding and waiting for an opportunity to seize the party, the government, and the army. It is extremely malicious. We absolutely will not allow Liu Shaoqi's conspiracy to succeed.

The great proletarian cultural revolution, personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao, has flushed out the great traitor Liu Shaoqi and a handful of traitors hiding in dark corners. The crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices in betraying the party and the nation are ironclad evidence, completely shattering his own manufactured fallacy of "a moment's hesitation."

　　批臭“一念之差”的叛徒逻辑
　　一级战斗英雄、特等功臣　胡修道
    刘少奇是中国革命的头号大叛徒。他多次跪倒在国民党反动派和帝国主义面前，背叛革命，以保存他的一条狗命。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“共产党员应该作到最有远见，最富于牺牲精神”，“在困难中不动摇，忠心耿耿地为民族、为阶级、为党而工作。”在革命需要时，共产党人应该“拿出自己的生命去殉我们的事业”。但是刘少奇却无耻地背叛马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，极力推行修正主义、投降主义的政治路线，炮制了一整套为叛徒提供“理论”依据的叛徒哲学。所谓“一念之差”，就是其中的一种。这是一种道道地地为叛徒辩护的反动逻辑。
    真正的无产阶级革命者、坚定的共产党人，只有一个理想，就是为了共产主义的实现，鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已。因此，枪林弹雨不退却，慷慨就义最镇定。看，国际主义英雄黄继光，为了支援世界革命，毅然用自己的身体挡住敌人的枪眼。看，无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部门合同志，在帮助群众安置土火箭发生意外爆炸的紧急时刻，以自己的生命保护了同志的安全。这些英雄的英勇行为，难道只是“一个想法”、“一念之差”吗？不！英雄的行为、英雄的思想完全来自无产阶级的优秀品质，来自毛泽东思想的哺育。这些用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命者，一心为革命，一切为人民，个人的生死安危在他们的头脑中从来没有地位，他们的共产主义世界观已经牢牢树立了，所以才能临危不惧，视死如归。
    至于刘少奇这个大叛徒及其同伙，从来就不是真正的革命者，而是混进革命队伍中的投机分子。他们背叛革命决不是什么“一个想法”，“一念之差”的缘故，而是他们反革命本质的彻底暴露。试想，当刘少奇屡次跪倒在国民党反动派和帝国主义面前的时候，难道是什么“一个想法”、“一念之差”吗？不是，绝对不是！他们本来就是资产阶级、地主阶级的孝子贤孙，他们一直就是国民党反动派和帝国主义的走狗。他们从来就没有一点无产阶级革命性，平时满脑子装的只是“钟爱自己”、“保护脑袋”，一遇风浪，必然是背叛革命、背叛人民。总之，这一切罪恶行为，都是来源于反革命的阶级本性，都是来源于对无产阶级革命事业的刻骨仇恨。“一念之差”的反动谬论绝对掩饰不了根深蒂固的反革命立场。
    刘少奇拚命鼓吹“一念之差”的反动谬论，实际上是给自己和所有叛徒开脱罪责。在这种谬论的掩护下，这个大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼及其同伙长期隐藏，兴风作浪，继续作恶。刘少奇所宣扬的“一念之差”又是一付麻醉剂。它以这套花言巧语鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭论”，麻醉人民革命斗志，妄图借此使自己及其同伙逃避革命人民的斗争，埋伏下来，伺机篡党、篡政、篡军。真是恶毒透顶。我们绝对不许刘少奇这种阴谋得逞。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，把大叛徒刘少奇和隐藏在各个阴暗角落里的一小撮叛徒统统冲刷出来了。刘少奇及其同伙叛党叛国的罪行铁证如山，彻底粉碎了他自己制造的所谓“一念之差”的反动谬论。
