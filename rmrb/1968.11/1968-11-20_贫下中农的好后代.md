At the study session on applying Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts in Houxinqiu Commune, Changwu County, Liaoning Province, there was a very active young man. He not only propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions but also read newspapers and documents, and taught everyone revolutionary songs, always busy. Everyone praised him, saying, "This is a good descendant of our poor and lower-middle peasants."

This young man is named Wang Fusheng, a son of a poor peasant. He loved labor very much when he was a child. However, after studying for a few years in an old-style school, he was corrupted by Liu Shaoqi's revisionist educational line. He became lazy and his heart changed; he no longer loved labor and spent all day just reading books. He complained about the dirt at home and found farm work too tiring. At the age of fifteen or sixteen, he couldn't even do simple farm work and didn't know the names of common farming tools. Once, Wang Fusheng went to work with a cart. The driver asked him to bring the "diao yang" (a farming tool), but he searched the house for half a day and didn't know which one was the "diao yang." He was so anxious that he was sweating all over and had no choice but to ask the driver. The driver told him, "The one with a bend is it." He looked at it and brought out a bent one. The driver took a look and said, "This isn't the 'diao yang,' this is the 'niu yangzi' (another farming tool)!" Wang Fusheng blushed with embarrassment. Finally, the driver himself went to get the "diao yang." After loading the cart, the driver told him to tie the "diao yang" to the "da cheng" (a part of the cart). Wang Fusheng thought this was easy and tied it with a large steelyard. The driver looked at it and was so angry that he couldn't help but laugh. He slapped his thigh and said, "This kind of school, the more it teaches students, the more stupid they become. After studying for a few years, they have become good-for-nothings."

In March of this year, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Gaojia Brigade, following Chairman Mao's great instruction, "The school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating our schools can no longer continue," seized back the power of the school. They established an educational revolution leadership group and changed the old practice of just reading books behind closed doors. They set up three classrooms: the first classroom is the production team, the second classroom is the field, and the third classroom is the original school. The curriculum is infused with Chairman Mao's policy of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor." It includes knowledge of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiments in rural areas. Whatever the countryside needs, the school teaches it, thus educating and training the former "foreign" students who couldn't record work points or do farm work. A few months passed, Wang Fusheng's face turned dark, his body became strong, his thoughts and feelings changed, and his heart was tempered red. He loves Chairman Mao and stands on the roof every day to broadcast, enthusiastically propagating Mao Zedong Thought, and conveying Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the hearts of every poor and lower-middle peasant as quickly as possible. He loves the collective, and when he sees the sorghum in the production team knocked down and trampled by pigs and chickens, he voluntarily cuts it down, ties it up, and sends it to the team. He is afraid that the bad road will damage the production team's rubber cart, so he uses his rest time to repair the road. He loves labor and participates in collective labor as soon as he returns from school, driving the cart, carrying manure, and always busy. Under the education of the poor and lower-middle peasants, he became an active element in studying the works of Chairman Mao.

　　贫下中农的好后代
    在辽宁彰武县后新秋公社活学活用毛泽东思想的讲用会上，有一个十分活跃的小青年。他既宣传毛主席最新指示，又读报纸、念文件，还教大家唱革命歌曲，忙个不停。大家都称赞说：“这是咱贫下中农的好后代。”
    这个小青年叫王福生，是个贫农的孩子，小时候挺热爱劳动。可是，在旧学校里念了几年书，让刘少奇的修正主义教育路线把这好孩子给教坏了，手懒了，心变了，不爱劳动了，一天到晚只知道啃书本。回家嫌家里脏，干活嫌活累。十五、六岁连一般农活都不会做，常用的农具也叫不出名来。有一回王福生跟车去干活，赶车的叫他把“吊样”拿来，他到屋里找了半天，也不知那个是“吊样”，急得满头大汗，没办法只得去问赶车的。赶车的告诉他说：“那个带弯的就是。”他瞅了瞅，就把一个带弯的拿出来了，赶车的一看说：“这哪是‘吊样’，这是‘牛样子’！”王福生臊得满脸通红，最后还是赶车的自己去把“吊样”拿了来。车装完了，赶车的叫他把“吊样”拴在“大橙”上，王福生一听这事好办，拿杆大秤就拴上了。赶车的一看，气得哭笑不得，拍着大腿说：“这号学校，越教学生越蠢。念了几年书，简直成了窝囊废。”
    今年三月，高家大队贫下中农遵照毛主席“学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了”的伟大教导，夺回了学校大权，建立了教育革命领导小组，改变了过去关起门来只啃书本的做法，建立了三个课堂：第一个课堂是生产队，第二个课堂是田间，第三个课堂是原来的学校。教材贯串了毛主席“教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针，把农村的阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验的知识都编到课本里去，农村需要啥，学校就教啥，使过去工分不会记，农活不会干的“洋”学生，受到了很好的教育和锻炼。几个月过去了，王福生脸晒黑了，身体结实了，思想感情变了，心也炼红了。他热爱毛主席，每天站在屋顶上广播，热情宣传毛泽东思想，把毛主席的最新指示以最快的速度传到每个贫下中农社员的心上。他热爱集体，看到生产队的高粱倒了，被猪鸡糟踏，就主动割下来捆好送到队里。他怕车道不好，颠坏了生产队的胶车，就利用休息时间，把车道修好。他热爱劳动，一从学校回来就参加集体劳动，又是赶车，又是倒粪，忙个不停。在贫下中农的教育下，他成了学习毛主席著作积极分子。
