Title: Reflections on a Soldier's Admission to the Party

Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "A proletarian party must also renew itself to remain vigorous." Studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, I was reminded of the process by which our company party branch admitted the old soldier Dong Alin.

Dong Alin joined the army from a factory in 1961. His entire family are workers. In terms of ideology, he eagerly studies Chairman Mao's works, learning and applying them. Every year when old soldiers retire, he is the first to volunteer for extended service. In terms of work, the young man has a fierce spirit. During construction, he always takes on the heaviest tasks. On extremely cold days, he works barefoot in the mud, his feet cut by ice shards, but he continues to work. However, he has a hot-tempered personality and likes to "blow up."

Dong Alin is very eager to join the party and has submitted three applications. Should we admit him to the party? There were two opinions in the branch committee meeting: one thought that Dong Alin has a good background and good ideology, and should be admitted to the party to bring in new blood; others were afraid that he would bring his "habit" of "blowing up" into the party, and advocated continuing to test him outside the party.

Which view is correct? The comrades in the branch committee, with this question in mind, studied Chairman Mao's teachings on how "the party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat, and should be a vigorous vanguard organization capable of leading the proletariat and revolutionary masses in the struggle against the class enemy." They discussed how to view Dong Alin's situation. Everyone analyzed his past criticisms point by point and found that most of his criticisms were correct, reflecting his loyalty to Chairman Mao and his revolutionary spirit of daring to uphold principles. This is his most precious quality. Once, he criticized me for not being thorough in my work and for not doing enough ideological work, which he saw as dereliction of duty. This criticism had a great impact on me and greatly promoted our work. Of course, his criticisms also had some one-sided and even incorrect aspects. Sometimes he criticized without considering the manner, which is his shortcoming, but this is not the main issue. Through analysis, everyone unanimously recognized: Dong Alin's criticisms sound "sharp," but this is only the surface; his criticisms are beneficial to the company's construction and helpful to comrades, which is the essence of the matter. "We must look at things from their essence." Daring to fight against all thoughts and behaviors that do not conform to Mao Zedong Thought is not a flaw, but rather, it is Dong Alin's outstanding virtue.

Some comrades raised the question: Dong Alin has many shortcomings, does he qualify as an advanced element of the proletariat? Everyone agreed: During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Dong Alin firmly stood on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. When propagating Mao Zedong Thought to the masses, he was fearless of threats and confrontations, and insisted on implementing the party's policies, demonstrating the selfless and fearless revolutionary spirit of a proletarian soldier. Comrades like him, who have a strong class struggle consciousness, a high awareness of the two-line struggle, and dare to stand up for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, are advanced elements of the proletariat and are the new blood we should absorb. With this understanding, everyone agreed to admit Dong Alin to the party.

Comrade Dong Alin did not disappoint his comrades. After joining the party, he maintained and developed his strengths, always setting an example, and gradually improved his shortcomings. To cultivate new forces, the organization decided to have him return from being a squad leader to a soldier, and he enthusiastically helped and supported the new squad leader, making the entire squad united and vigorous.

Reflecting on Dong Alin's experience of joining the party, I deeply feel: To thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "renewing oneself," we must thoroughly criticize the revisionist party-building line of the big traitor Liu Shaoqi and continuously eliminate the influence and poison of the revisionist party-building line in our minds. Only in this way can we ensure that we absorb true advanced elements of the proletariat into the party, continuously bring in new blood, and keep our party forever young and vigorous.

### 从一个战士的入党想到的

　　从一个战士的入党想到的
　　空军某部政治指导员　冯文发
    毛主席最近教导我们：“一个无产阶级的党也要吐故纳新，才能朝气蓬勃。”学习毛主席这一最新指示，我想起我们连党支部吸收老战士童阿林入党的前前后后。
    童阿林是一九六一年从工厂入伍的老战士，全家都是工人。论思想，他如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作，学一点用一点。每年老战士退役，他总是头一个要求超期服役。论工作，小伙子有股虎劲。部队施工，他专挑重活干。数九天光着脚和泥，两只脚被冰碴子划得一道道的，还照样干。可就是有个火爆脾气，爱“放炮”。
    童阿林要求入党很迫切，接连写过三次申请书。能不能吸收他入党呢？支委会上有两种意见：一种认为小童成份好，思想好，应该吸收他入党，增加新鲜血液；另外一些同志怕他把爱“放炮”的“毛病”带到党里来，主张还是先在党外考验考验。
    究竟那种看法对呢？支委会的同志带着这个问题学习了毛主席关于“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织”的教导，就怎样看待童阿林的问题进行了讨论。大家对童阿林过去提的意见逐条进行了分析，发现他的意见大多数是正确的，表现了他忠于毛主席，敢于坚持原则的革命精神，这正是他最可宝贵的品质。有一次，他曾批评我工作不深入，思想工作抓得不紧，是失职的行为。这一批评对我震动很大，大大促进了我们的工作。当然，他的意见也有不全面甚至不正确的地方，有时候提意见不讲方式，这是他的缺点，但这决不是主要方面。通过分析，大家一致认识到：童阿林的意见听起来“刺耳”，这只是现象；他的意见对连队建设有好处，对同志有帮助，这才是事情的实质。“我们看事情必须要看它的实质”。敢于向一切不符合毛泽东思想的思想和行为进行斗争，这不但不是毛病，相反地，正是童阿林的突出的优点。
    有的同志又提出，童阿林有不少缺点，算不算无产阶级先进分子？大家认为：童阿林在无产阶级文化大革命中，坚定地站在毛主席革命路线上。他在向群众宣传毛泽东思想时，不怕威胁，不怕围斗，坚持执行了党的政策，表现了一个无产阶级战士无私无畏的革命精神。象他这样阶级斗争观念比较强，两条路线斗争觉悟比较高，为保卫毛主席革命路线敢于挺身而出的同志，就是无产阶级的先进分子，就是我们应该吸收的新鲜血液。认识统一了，大家一致同意吸收童阿林同志入党。
    童阿林同志没有辜负同志们的期望。入党以后，他保持和发扬了自己的优点，处处起模范带头作用，一些缺点也渐渐改了。为了培养新生力量，组织上决定他由班长再当战士，他就满腔热情地帮助和支持新班长工作，使全班团结一致，朝气勃勃。
    回想一下童阿林入党的经历，我深深体会到：要很好地贯彻执行毛主席关于“吐故纳新”的最新指示，就要彻底批判大叛徒刘少奇的修正主义建党路线，就要不断地清除我们头脑里的修正主义建党路线的影响和流毒。只有这样，才能保证把真正的无产阶级先进分子吸收到党内来，才能不断增加新鲜血液，使我们的党永葆革命青春，永远朝气蓬勃。
