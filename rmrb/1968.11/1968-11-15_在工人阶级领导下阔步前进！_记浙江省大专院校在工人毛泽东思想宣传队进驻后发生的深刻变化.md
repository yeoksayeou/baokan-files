The working class must lead everything. At the command of the great leader Chairman Mao, the broad masses of industrial workers in Zhejiang Province, under the leadership of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, formed the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams. In early September, they marched into the "independent kingdom" of higher education institutions, which had long been dominated by bourgeois intellectuals, and took the stage of leading the educational revolution.

After the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams entered the schools, they used Chairman Mao's thoughts on educational revolution as their weapon. They firmly relied on the active elements within the schools who were determined to carry the proletarian educational revolution to the end. They united the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff, launching a total attack on the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, on all the black goods of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, and on a handful of class enemies. With the force of a thunderbolt and the momentum of a landslide, they "swept away a thousand troops like a mat," transforming people's thoughts and the appearance of the schools. Below are a few fragments of the profound changes that have taken place in higher education institutions since the arrival of the Workers' Propaganda Teams.

Following Chairman Mao is Victory

Zhejiang University was a stronghold where bourgeois intellectuals reigned supreme. In 1958, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff launched a storm of educational revolution, shaking it to its core. At that time, the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi rushed to Zhejiang University, directing a handful of capitalist roaders within the party to strangle the revolutionary fervor in its cradle.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution sounded the alarm, and the revolutionary teachers and students of Zhejiang University raised high the banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries." Like a volcanic eruption, they broke through the net of the bourgeois reactionary line, charging into society, sweeping away the "Four Olds," and directly attacking the lair of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee. Together with the Red Guards of the entire province, they played a vanguard role in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Zhejiang.

However, a handful of class enemies who refused to perish used every means to create divisions among the revolutionary youth, incite "internal wars," and stir up anarchist tendencies, resisting the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, opposing the proletarian educational revolution, and disrupting the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the schools.

Faced with this situation, the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at Zhejiang University, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "guide the petty-bourgeois mentality within our ranks to the path of proletarian revolution," spared no effort to arm the revolutionary youth with Mao Zedong Thought and to unify their understanding, steps, and actions with Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The team first led the revolutionary teachers and students to focus on the issue of their attitude towards Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They guided them to carry out extensive "three loyalties" activities, educating them to be forever loyal to Chairman Mao. Under the leadership of the Workers' Propaganda Team, the "three loyalties" activities were carried out vigorously throughout the school, and the phenomenon of "internal wars" disappeared. The campus of Zhejiang University presented a scene of unity, tension, seriousness, and liveliness. Every time the sun rose, the revolutionary teachers and students would gather on the playground in neat rows, holding the red book, singing "The East Is Red," and unanimously wishing the great leader Chairman Mao long life!

Following Chairman Mao is victory! After the Workers' Propaganda Team entered Zhejiang University, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation seriously," they mobilized the masses extensively and carried out a thorough criticism and repudiation of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist poison. The revolutionary criticism and repudiation struck a heavy blow to a handful of class enemies, greatly raising the class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff, consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. In the Class 651 of the Chemical Department's Chemistry Major, there were seven female students who lived in the same dormitory. In the early stages of the movement, they connected with each other, labored together, and marched together as close comrades. Due to the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line, they later split into two factions, drawing lines in the dormitory and not communicating with each other. When Zhang, the worker who propagated Mao Zedong Thought in this class, discovered this problem, he recalled the bitterness and sweetness with them, organized them to participate in labor training, and carried out revolutionary criticism and repudiation, concentrating their deep hatred on the number one capitalist roader within the party, Liu Shaoqi. Revolutionary criticism and repudiation made the class sisters, who had once split, hold hands again. One evening, in the room where they had once drawn lines, the seven students, holding Zhang's hand in front of the great leader Chairman Mao's portrait, with excited hearts, holding the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," pledged their loyalty, determined to unite under the leadership of the Workers' Propaganda Team and carry the educational revolution in the school to the end.

At 8:30 PM on November 1, a piece of exhilarating news was broadcast: the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was issued! The students listened repeatedly, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" from the bottom of their hearts. They absorbed drop by drop the sunshine and dew of happiness, and their bodies were filled with boundless strength. Many students organized themselves to write slogans, make pledges, send the good news, and work through the night. The entire campus was filled with a vibrant atmosphere. New Zhejiang University is sailing forward, breaking waves, and advancing bravely along the course charted by Chairman Mao!

Firmly Walk the Path of Integrating with Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers

When the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team first entered Zhejiang Medical University, they encountered a "persistent problem"—the distribution of over 300 graduates. Among these graduates, many reflected the thoughts of fearing mountains, fearing water, fearing distance, and fearing hardship, longing for the city, and not wanting to go to the countryside or the border areas.

Why did a large number of children from workers and peasants, after studying at the university for a few years, not want to integrate with workers and peasants and not want to serve workers and peasants?

The Workers' Propaganda Team, from the active thoughts reflected by the graduates in the distribution issue, once again deeply understood the evil consequences of bourgeois intellectuals dominating the schools. They said that it was necessary to carry out re-education for the broad teachers and students on the issues of serving whom and taking which path. They decided to take class education as a key course for implementing proletarian political leadership in the school.

At the meeting to recall bitterness and think of sweetness, the old worker Xu Chunlong, with tears in his eyes, recounted the bloody family history of the old society. He lost his mother when he was young, and his father was taken away by the Kuomintang reactionaries to be a soldier, becoming a helpless orphan. In the cold winter, he still went barefoot, struggling on the brink of death.... At this moment, a student angrily shouted: "Never forget class bitterness! Remember blood debt!" "Down with the public enemy Chiang Kai-shek!" "Down with the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi!" This was Lei Dong, the son of a poor peasant, who, thinking of his own bitter family history similar to that of the old worker, could no longer suppress the anger of deep hatred for the old society.

In that dark old society, when Lei Dong was three years old, his mother had just given birth to a younger sister, and she died of poverty and illness without any medicine. The poor younger sister, who had just been born for a few days, starved to death. His father, to avoid being conscripted, often hid in the deep mountains and dared not enter the village. The young Lei Dong was raised by the poor and lower-middle peasants in the village.

He also recalled that when he first entered the medical university, the poor and lower-middle peasants in the village were all happy that the son of a poor peasant could enter the university. They repeatedly instructed him to fight for the poor and lower-middle peasants, learn good medical skills, and return to the countryside to be a doctor. When he first entered the medical university, Lei Dong always kept in mind the instructions of the poor and lower-middle peasants and paid special attention to learning the treatment of common diseases in the countryside. However, under the poison of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, he gradually developed the thought of seeking fame and fortune and no longer wanted to return to the countryside. Thinking of this, Lei Dong felt that he had unknowingly forgotten his roots and, from the bottom of his heart, felt that he had let down Chairman Mao and the poor and lower-middle peasants. He wrote in his diary with a heart full of hatred for Liu Shaoqi's revisionist educational line:

"Lei Dong, Lei Dong! You are the descendant of a poor peasant. Chairman Mao saved you from the depths of suffering. The poor and lower-middle peasants raised you. Whose words do you listen to if not Chairman Mao's? For whom do you serve if not the poor and lower-middle peasants? You must not forget the pain after the wound has healed! Your head may be cut off, your blood may flow, but Mao Zedong Thought must not be discarded. The sea may dry up, the stones may rot, but the red heart loyal to Chairman Mao will never change!"

On the joyous day of the 19th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, after the baptism of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the future of the motherland is bright. Lei Dong felt a bright future ahead. He was filled with revolutionary enthusiasm and, with iron-like language, wrote a pledge to the county, commune, and production team in his hometown. He expressed his determination to be forever loyal to Chairman Mao, respectfully regard the working class as his teacher, and accept the re-education of workers, peasants, and soldiers. After graduation, he was determined to return to the countryside and serve the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the re-education of intellectuals by workers, peasants, and soldiers were like a strong east wind, making the entire campus of the medical university boil. The report on "barefoot doctors" published in the "Red Flag" magazine showed a broad road for the medical education revolution. "Walk the path of 'barefoot doctors,'" became the common vow of over 300 graduates to Chairman Mao. Graduate Chen Yutian wrote in the distribution wish book:

"Workers and peasants nurtured me for eighteen years,
Taught me skills to serve the people,
If you ask where my wish is,
It is where workers and peasants need it!"

They went to the countryside, to the border areas, to where the motherland needed them the most, with great enthusiasm and determination, happily embarking on a new revolutionary journey!

　　在工人阶级领导下阔步前进！
　　——记浙江省大专院校在工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻后发生的深刻变化
    “工人阶级必须领导一切”。伟大领袖毛主席一声号令，浙江省的广大产业工人，派出自己的优秀代表，在省革委会的领导下，组成工人毛泽东思想宣传队，于九月初浩浩荡荡地开进了一向为资产阶级知识分子所把持的“独立王国”——大专院校，登上了领导教育革命的政治舞台。
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻学校后，以毛主席的教育革命思想为武器，坚决依靠学校中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子，团结广大革命师生员工，向叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线，向一切封、资、修的黑货，向一小撮阶级敌人发起了总攻击，以雷霆万钧之力，排山倒海之势，“横扫千军如卷席”，使人的思想和学校的面貌焕然一新。下面是大专院校在工人宣传队进驻后发生的深刻变化的几个片断。
    紧跟毛主席就是胜利
    浙江大学是一所资产阶级知识分子称王称霸的顽固堡垒。一九五八年，在毛主席无产阶级教育路线的指引下，广大革命师生员工掀起教育革命风暴，把它震撼得摇摇晃晃。那时，叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇急急忙忙窜到浙江大学，指使党内一小撮走资派，把一场轰轰烈烈的教育革命扼杀在摇篮里。
    无产阶级文化大革命一声炮响，浙江大学的广大革命师生高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，象火山爆发一样冲决了资产阶级反动路线的罗网，杀向社会，横扫“四旧”，直捣浙江省委内一小撮走资派的老巢。他们和全省红卫兵小将一起，在浙江无产阶级文化大革命中起了先锋作用。
    可是，一小撮不甘心灭亡的阶级敌人，千方百计在革命小将中制造分裂，挑动“内战”，煽动无政府主义思潮，抵制毛主席的一系列最新指示的贯彻落实，反对无产阶级教育革命，破坏学校的斗、批、改。
    面对这种情况，进驻浙江大学的工人毛泽东思想宣传队遵照毛主席“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题”的教导，全力用毛泽东思想武装革命小将的头脑，用毛主席的最新指示统一他们的认识、步伐和行动。宣传队首先引导革命师生狠抓对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席革命路线的态度问题，带领他们广泛开展“三忠于”活动，教育他们要永远忠于毛主席。在工人宣传队领导下，“三忠于”活动在全校搞得轰轰烈烈，“内战”的现象不见了，浙大校园呈现一片团结、紧张、严肃、活泼的气氛。每当旭日东升的时候，革命师生就排着整齐的队伍，集合在操场上，手捧红色宝书，高唱《东方红》，同声敬祝伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！
    紧跟毛主席就是胜利！工人宣传队进驻浙江大学后，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“认真搞好斗、批、改”的伟大教导，广泛发动群众，深入开展革命大批判，彻底肃清刘少奇的反革命修正主义流毒。革命大批判狠狠打击了一小撮阶级敌人，大大提高了广大革命师生员工的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，巩固和发展了革命大联合、革命三结合。化工系化学专业六五一班有七位女同学，同住一个寝室，运动初期，是一起串连，一起劳动，一起长征的亲密战友。由于资产阶级反动路线的影响，后来分裂成两派，在寝室里也划线为界，不相往来。到这个班宣传毛泽东思想的张师傅发现这个问题，便同她们一起忆苦思甜，组织她们参加劳动锻炼，进行革命大批判，把深仇大恨集中在党内头号走资派刘少奇身上。革命大批判使得一度分开的阶级姊妹，重新携起手来。一天晚上，就在原来划线为界的房间里，这七位同学拉着张师傅在伟大领袖毛主席像前，怀着激动的心情，手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，共表忠心，决心团结起来，在工人宣传队的领导下，将学校的教育革命进行到底。
    十一月一日晚八点半，从广播里传出一个振奋人心的喜讯——党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表了！同学们一遍一遍地听着，从心底里发出“毛主席万岁！”的欢呼声，他们一点一滴地吸收着幸福的阳光、雨露，浑身增加了无穷的力量。许多同学自动组织起来，写标语，表决心，送喜报，通宵达旦，整个校园一派朝气蓬勃的景象。新浙大正沿着毛主席指引的航向，乘风破浪，奋勇前进！
    坚定地走同工农兵相结合的道路
    工人毛泽东思想宣传队刚进浙江医科大学，就碰上了一个“老大难”问题——三百多名毕业生分配问题。在这些毕业生中，有许多人反映了怕山、怕水、怕远、怕苦，留恋城市，不愿去农村、去边疆的思想。
    为什么大批来自工农的子弟，读了几年大学，就不愿意与工农结合，不愿意为工农服务？
    工人宣传队从毕业生在毕业分配问题上反映出来的活思想中，再一次深深地认识了资产阶级知识分子统治学校的恶果。他们说，必须对广大师生深入进行为谁服务，走什么道路的再教育。他们决定把阶级教育作为对学校实施无产阶级政治领导的一门主课来抓。
    在忆苦思甜大会上，老工人徐春龙含着眼泪，诉说了旧社会的血泪家史。他从小死去了母亲，父亲又被国民党反动派抓去当兵，成了一个无依无靠的孤儿，寒冬腊月还赤着脚，挣扎在死亡线上……。这时，一个学生愤怒地高呼：“不忘阶级苦！牢记血泪仇！”“打倒人民公敌蒋介石！”“打倒叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇！”这是贫农的儿子叶东同学，联想到自己和老工人同样的苦难家史，再也按捺不住对旧社会深仇大恨迸发出来的怒火。
    在那暗无天日的旧社会，叶东三岁的时候，母亲刚生下妹妹，贫病交迫，无医无药，爸爸只好眼睁睁地看着母亲死去。可怜的妹妹出生才几天，就活活饿死。爸爸为了逃避抓壮丁，经常躲在深山中不敢进村。年幼的叶东，是依靠村里的贫下中农抚养长大的。
    他又想起，自己刚刚考进医科大学的时候，村里贫下中农都为贫农的儿子能进大学感到高兴，他们千叮万嘱，要自己为贫下中农争口气，学好了医术，回农村当医生。刚进医大时，叶东心里还时刻想着贫下中农的嘱咐，特别重视学习农村常见疾病的治疗。可是，在刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线的毒害下，他渐渐滋长了成名成家的思想，不再想回农村了。想到这里，叶东觉得自己不知不觉地忘了本，从内心里感到对不起毛主席，对不起贫下中农。他怀着切齿痛恨刘少奇修正主义教育路线的心情，在日记本上写下了这样一段话：
      “叶东啊，叶东！你是贫农的后代，是毛主席把你从水深火热中救了出来，是贫下中农培养了你。你不听毛主席的话听谁的话？！你不为贫下中农服务为谁服务？！你决不能好了伤疤忘了痛啊！头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不可丢，海可枯，石可烂，忠于毛主席的红心永不变！”
    在全国山河一片红的国庆十九周年的大喜节日里，经过文化大革命战斗洗礼的祖国前程似锦，叶东感到眼前一片光明。他满怀革命豪情，用钢铁一般的语言，给家乡的县、公社、生产队各写了一份决心书。表示要永远忠于毛主席，恭恭敬敬拜工人阶级为师，接受工农兵的再教育。毕业后决心回农村，为贫下中农服务。
    毛主席关于知识分子要接受工农兵再教育的最新指示，象强劲的东风，使医大整个校园沸腾起来，《红旗》杂志发表上海市关于“赤脚医生”的调查报告，给医学教育革命展示了广阔的道路。“走‘赤脚医生’的道路”，成了三百多名毕业生向毛主席敬献忠心的共同誓言。毕业生陈玉蟾同学在分配志愿书上，写了这样一首诗：“工农栽培十八载，教我本领为人民，若问志愿在何方？工农所需志所向！”他们到农村去，到边疆去，到祖国最需要的地方去，满怀豪情壮志，愉快地走上了新的革命征途！
