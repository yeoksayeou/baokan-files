The entire nation's military and civilian population, inspired by the Party's Twelfth Plenum's communiqué, are brimming with enthusiasm and high morale. They are determined to follow the great strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, to achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Under the unified command of the Proletarian Headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, the entire nation's military and civilian population are determined to continue exposing the treasonous crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices, to thoroughly purge the reactionary revisionist thoughts of Liu Shaoqi and other top capitalist roaders within the Party, and to resolutely complete all the great battle tasks proposed by the Plenum. They will strive to make all aspects of work even more outstanding.

The victorious convening of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee and the publication of the communiqué have greatly inspired the hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers across the nation. On this joyous day of celebrating the communiqué, the vast land of our motherland, red everywhere, presents a festive scene. In recent days, 15 million people in Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin have taken to the streets to hold unprecedented grand celebrations. In Shenyang, Changchun, Harbin, Shijiazhuang, Hohhot, Taiyuan, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Changsha, Zhengzhou, Nanning, Xi'an, Urumqi, Xining, Lanzhou, Yinchuan, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Fuzhou, Nanchang, Hefei, Jinan, Chengdu, Kunming, Guiyang, and Lhasa, tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of people have gathered for rallies and parades. In vast rural areas, pastoral regions, mountain villages, and fishing towns, billions of poor and lower-middle peasants have gathered to celebrate. The shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!" and "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!" shake the earth and echo through the skies. Revolutionary committees in various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have held meetings, issuing notices or decisions to firmly support the Plenum's resolutions and enthusiastically respond to all the calls made by the Plenum. A mass movement to study the communiqué, propagate the communiqué, and implement all the tasks proposed by the Plenum has already begun to flourish across the nation's cities and countryside.

The broad masses of revolutionary people and the PLA soldiers firmly support the decision to expel the traitor, spy, and capitalist roader Liu Shaoqi from the Party permanently and to remove all his positions within and outside the Party. They continue to expose the treasonous crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices. They point out that in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Liu Shaoqi, a loyal running dog of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the Nationalist reactionaries, has been exposed and expelled from the revolutionary ranks. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The local military and civilian population firmly support the Plenum's serious criticism of the February Counterrevolutionary Wind of 1967 and the evil wind this spring that attempted to rehabilitate the February Counterrevolutionary Wind. They unanimously agree that smashing the February Counterrevolutionary Wind and the evil wind that attempted to rehabilitate it is a major victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line over the bourgeois reactionary line. They unanimously express their determination to heed the Party Central Committee's call to remain vigilant against the sabotage activities of the exploiting classes and their agents. With hearts full of joy and inspiration, the hundreds of millions of military and civilian population across the nation enthusiastically support the Party Central Committee's decision to convene the Ninth National Congress of the Party at an appropriate time and express their determination to welcome the victorious convening of the Ninth Congress with new battle achievements.

While deeply studying the Plenum's communiqué, the hundreds of millions of people across the nation have reviewed the great victories achieved in the Cultural Revolution over the past two years and have gained a deeper understanding of the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching that "This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is completely necessary and very timely for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist restoration, and building socialism." They firmly declare that they will more closely unite around the Proletarian Headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to unify their thoughts, steps, and actions. They will resolutely criticize the reactionary bourgeois "multi-centerism." The broad masses of revolutionary people in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and many other places have studied the communiqué word for word, deeply grasped its spirit, and with revolutionary enthusiasm, pledged to Chairman Mao: We have only one will—to firmly and unshakably use your brilliant thoughts to guide everything; we have only one step—to closely follow your great strategic deployment and advance bravely; we have only one action—to fully implement the battle calls issued by the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee under the leadership of the working class; we have only one determination—to solidly realize the tasks you proposed for each stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

Members of revolutionary committees at various levels, broad industrial workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, PLA soldiers, revolutionary Red Guards, and revolutionary students and teachers are determined to resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's teaching that "the working class must lead everything" and to realize "the dictatorship of the proletariat in the superstructure, including all cultural realms." They will thoroughly complete the tasks proposed by Chairman Mao for each stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation. The broad masses of workers in Beijing who are members of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams have repeatedly studied the communiqué, and their fighting spirit is even more ardent. They say, Chairman Mao has entrusted us with the great historical task; we will not leave the battlefield until we have completed the struggle, criticism, and transformation in all realms of the superstructure. Comrades from the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at Wuhan Institute of Iron and Steel say, the working class leading everything means using Mao Zedong Thought to lead everything. We workers must become models of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, leading revolutionary students to do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of schools, and letting the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly high and forever in the educational front. Revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary students across the nation have expressed their determination to honestly accept the leadership of the working class and follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao to integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers.

While enthusiastically celebrating the victorious convening of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee and the publication of the communiqué, the broad masses of revolutionary people and PLA soldiers across the nation have launched a new high tide of revolutionary criticism. They are determined to follow the great battle calls proposed by the Plenum, to thoroughly purge the reactionary revisionist thoughts of Liu Shaoqi and other top capitalist roaders within the Party, and to further clean up the class ranks in conjunction with revolutionary criticism, exposing the handful of counterrevolutionaries hidden among the broad masses.

Members of revolutionary committees at various levels, broad Party members, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and PLA soldiers are determined to continue carrying out Chairman Mao's great principles of revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination, seriously implementing Chairman Mao's great instructions on rectifying and building the Party, streamlining organizations, sending cadres down to labor, and reforming unreasonable regulations and systems. They will build the newly born revolutionary committees into revolutionary, close-to-the-masses battle command departments and build our great, glorious, and correct Party to be even stronger and more vigorous.

The hundreds of millions of military and civilian population across the nation are determined to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness." They will make all aspects of work even more outstanding. In recent days, from oil fields, from mines, from steel furnaces, and from transportation lines, reports of victories in grasping revolution and promoting production have been continuously coming in. The broad masses of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants are determined to make our country's industrial and agricultural production and all socialist construction undertakings achieve a new leap. The broad masses of PLA soldiers and revolutionary people have made a heroic vow: We will further consolidate national defense and continue to do a good job in supporting the army and loving the people. We will definitely liberate Taiwan! For the wolf-like Americans and Soviet revisionists, we will definitely be a hundred times more vigilant! If any enemy dares to invade, we will definitely, thoroughly, completely, and entirely annihilate them.

Students and teachers at Beijing Institute of Civil Engineering firmly support the decision to permanently expel the traitor, spy, and capitalist roader Liu Shaoqi from the Party. They firmly respond to the call issued by the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, continuing to deeply criticize and thoroughly expose the traitor, spy, and capitalist roader Liu Shaoqi's attempt to resist and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally directing the capitalist reactionary line in Beijing Institute of Civil Engineering, and purging all the poison left by Liu Shaoqi.
