The "soybean hometown" of the Songliao Plain—Yushu County, Jilin Province—has once again seen a bumper harvest of soybeans this year, with a yield per unit area increased by 28 percent compared to last year. Currently, the vast number of poor and lower-middle peasants across the county, inspired by the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, are eagerly selling high-quality soybeans to the state. This year, Yushu County experienced a severe drought, an occurrence not seen in many years. Following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, with the heroic spirit of "crushing all enemies," launched a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies while tenaciously fighting the drought. Ultimately, they overcame the drought and ensured the growth of crops.

The publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has greatly inspired the poor and lower-middle peasants of Yushu County. They have been working through the night to thresh and winnow the soybeans, sending the high-quality soybeans to the state as soon as possible. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    榆树县贫下中农踊跃交售上等大豆
    松辽平原的“大豆之乡”——吉林省榆树县，今年大豆又获得丰收，单位面积产量比去年增加百分之二十八。目前，全县广大贫下中农，在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报鼓舞下，正踊跃向国家交售上等大豆。今年，榆树县遭到了多年不遇的旱灾，广大贫下中农遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，以“要压倒一切敌人”的英雄气概，一面向一小撮阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，一面顽强地同旱灾展开英勇的搏斗，终于战胜了干旱，保证了农作物的生长。
    党的八届十二中全会公报的发表，极大地鼓舞了榆树县的广大贫下中农，他们连夜铺场打场，把上等大豆及早送交国家。（据新华社）
