Industrial production in the United States has continued to decline, according to official figures released, after a sharp drop in August, industrial production further decreased in September, falling to its lowest level since April this year.

The steel industry, which saw the largest decline, had its production index drop from 113.8 in August to 107.

The coal mining and petroleum industries also saw their production indices decrease by 4.8 and 2.9 respectively compared to August.

Price Index Rises

Official figures show that prices in the United States continued to rise in August, with the consumer price index reaching a new high. Among these, the prices of food and housing, which are essential for the lives of the broad masses of working people, saw the most significant increases.

Due to the continuous rise in prices, the actual purchasing power of the U.S. dollar is rapidly declining. The U.S. ruling class admits that in just over three years, from January 1965 to the present, the actual purchasing power of the dollar has decreased by nearly 15%.

In a speech in late September this year, Federal Reserve Chairman Martin anxiously acknowledged that if the actual purchasing power of the dollar continues to fall unchecked, it will inevitably cause "serious harm" to the U.S. domestic economy and international balance of payments.

    美国财政经济情况恶化
    工业生产下降
    美国官方公布的数字表明，美国的工业生产继八月份出现陡降之后，在九月份进一步下降，跌到了今年四月以来的最低水平。
    下降幅度最大的仍然是钢铁工业，生产指数由八月份的一一三点八降到了一○七。
    采煤工业和原油工业的生产指数也分别比八月份降低四点八和二点九。
    物价指数上涨
    据官方公布，八月份美国物价继续上涨，消费品价格指数涨到了新高峰；其中为广大劳动人民生活所必需的食品和住房涨价最为猛烈。
    由于物价不断上涨，美元的实际购买力正急遽降低。美国统治集团承认，自从一九六五年一月到现在，短短三年多的时间里，美元的实际购买力下降了将近百分之十五。
    美国联邦储备委员会主席马丁在今年九月下旬的一次讲话中不安地承认，如果听任美元的实际购买力继续无止境地跌落下去，将不可避免地对美国的国内经济和国际收支造成“严重危害”。
