Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our educational policy must enable the students to develop morally, intellectually, and physically, so that they will become socially conscious, cultured workers." The traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, in opposition to our great leader Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, stubbornly promotes the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, advocating the theory of "reading books to become officials," detaching from proletarian politics, from the workers and peasants, and from productive labor, and cultivating revisionist seedlings who cannot lift a hand or shoulder a burden.

I have two sons. My elder son, Bingqian, studies at the so-called key public school, Guangzong Middle School. My younger son, Bingchen, attends the elementary school's attached junior middle school class run by poor and lower-middle-class peasants. These two schools follow two different educational lines, walk two different paths, and cultivate two different types of successors. This difference is clearly evident in my two sons.

Bingqian has been studying in the city for three to four years of middle school and has developed a sweet tongue, speaking in a flowery and vague manner, but all talk and no action. Because he has been poisoned by Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, his thoughts have changed, becoming more bourgeois and lazy, turning into a "young master."

Bingchen studies at the junior middle school class in our village, living and working with the poor and lower-middle-class peasants, constantly receiving their education, and growing through the three great revolutionary movements. He has become a good successor to the poor and lower-middle-class peasants.

This spring, following Chairman Mao's instructions, we established a family Mao Zedong Thought study class. In the study class, Bingchen leads the whole family in studying Chairman Mao's works and takes the lead in criticizing and repudiating revisionism. Through the study class, we have changed the feudal old custom of the elders being in charge, and Mao Zedong Thought has taken charge. No matter who speaks, if it aligns with Mao Zedong Thought, we listen to them. Bingchen does everything according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and our family admires him. Bingqian, however, does not participate in the study class when he returns from the city; instead, he looks down on it. He mocks Bingchen, saying, "What kind of study class is this? With the elders still alive, a teenager of ten or so is already acting like the boss." Look! A middle school student says such things, even more backward than this old man in his fifties or sixties. This is all the result of the poison of the traitor Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, and this account must be settled with Liu Shaoqi.

Once, the brigade held a criticism meeting to criticize a Kuomintang member and rich peasant. Both Bingqian and Bingchen went on stage to criticize. Bingqian can talk well, with a lot of theory, but he only picks at words and phrases, failing to hit the point and missing the target. Bingchen found this intolerable and immediately went on stage to expose how this rich peasant went to Shijiazhuang to join the "Return to the Countryside Corps," aiming to rally reactionary forces to make a comeback and dream of a counter-revolution. Such an exposure frightened the enemy, making his legs tremble and his face sweat. Bingqian, detached from reality in school and rarely participating in class struggles, has been poisoned by Liu Shaoqi's theory of "the extinction of class struggle," failing to see the severity of class struggle, and not recognizing the true nature of class enemies. Therefore, his criticism is not fierce. This is another crime committed by the traitor Liu Shaoqi.

The two sons have two different thoughts and feelings. One day, the brigade sent Bingqian to the dung pit. Bingqian took the shovel and walked to the edge of the dung pit. Seeing it full of stench and filth, he circled the pit twice, unable to step in, circled it again, still unable to step in, and grumbled, "Bad luck, assigning me this job, I won't earn this work point." He dragged the shovel and left. Bingchen saw his brother unwilling to clean the dung pit, snatched the shovel from him, rolled up his pants, jumped into the pit, and started shoveling vigorously, getting dung on his legs and sweating profusely. The poor and lower-middle-class peasants praised him, saying, "It's still the students from our attached middle school class, put them anywhere, they are red in thought and covered in mud." Bingqian, in the so-called "standardized" school, detached from the poor and lower-middle-class peasants, the more years he studies, the farther he is from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and the more detached he becomes from the poor and lower-middle-class peasants, no longer resembling a son of a poor peasant.

Another time, after the wheat harvest, Bingqian and Bingchen both went to weed the cornfield. Bingchen, having learned corn thinning in the agricultural technology class, weeded quickly and well. Bingqian worked up a sweat, weeding slowly and poorly. What was amusing was that he cut the seedlings from above the five nodes, leaving the roots, and a few days later, one seedling grew into two or three, all becoming "double-headed" seedlings. This is all the result of the influence of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. The child has thrown away the poor and lower-middle-class peasants' precious tradition of being able to labor and loving labor.

From the above facts, it is not difficult to see that those so-called key schools are deeply influenced by Liu Shaoqi's revisionist educational line. After a few years of study, the children of poor and lower-middle-class peasants change, with bourgeois thoughts filling their minds. Over time, they will turn into revisionists. Schools managed by poor and lower-middle-class peasants follow Chairman Mao's instructions step by step. Whatever he says, we do. Education is closely linked to the three great revolutionary movements, never straying from the poor and lower-middle-class peasants. The students cultivated are both literate and martial, ready to take over the revolution and hold the revolutionary seal. Only then will we, the poor and lower-middle-class peasants, be at ease.

    两种学校培养两种接班人
    河北广宗县件只公社张尹村大队贫农社员　任永波
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。”叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇，同我们伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级教育路线大唱反调，顽固推行反革命修正主义教育路线，鼓吹“读书做官论”，脱离无产阶级政治，脱离工农群众，脱离生产劳动，培养手不能提，肩不能担的修正主义苗子。
    我有两个儿子，大儿子丙乾在所谓公办的重点学校广宗中学念书。二儿子丙臣上了俺贫下中农办的小学附设初中班。两个学校，执行的是两条教育路线，走的是两条路，培养了两种接班人。从我两个孩子身上，清楚地看出了这个问题。
    丙乾在城里上了三、四年中学，炼出一副甜嘴巴，说起话来一大套，云天雾地，就是光说不做，说做两张皮。因为受到刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线的毒害，思想上发生了变化，由土变洋，成了好吃懒做的“大少爷”。
    丙臣在本村附中班上学，和贫下中农实行五同（同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同批判），经常接受贫下中农的教育，在三大革命实践中锻炼成长，成了贫下中农的好后代。
    今年春天，我们遵照毛主席的教导，办起了家庭毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，丙臣领着全家学习毛主席著作，带头斗私批修。经过办学习班，改变了家长为正、长辈当家的封建旧习惯，毛泽东思想当了家，无论大人小孩，谁说的符合毛泽东思想，就听谁的。丙臣事事按毛主席指示办，俺家都佩服。丙乾从城里回来，不但不参加学习班，对这事还看不惯哩！他讽刺丙臣：“你们办的学习班是个啥？！有老人在世，十几岁的毛孩子，就当起掌柜的来了。”看！堂堂的中学生，竟说出这些话，比我这五、六十岁的老头子还落后哩。这都是大叛徒刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线的流毒造成的，这笔账一定要跟刘少奇清算。
    有一次，队里召开批判大会，批判一个国民党员、富农分子。丙乾、丙臣都上台批判，丙乾嘴倒是挺能说，理论一大篇，咬文嚼字，光钻字眼儿，批不到点子上，打不中要害。丙臣一听就不顺耳朵，立即上台揭穿这个富农分子跑到石家庄，加入还乡团，是为了纠集反动势力，卷土重来，梦想变天。这样一揭露，吓得敌人两腿打颤，脸上冒汗。丙乾在学校脱离实际，很少参加阶级斗争，受了刘少奇“阶级斗争熄灭论”的毒害，看不到阶级斗争的严重性，对阶级敌人的本质认不清，批得就不狠。这也是大叛徒刘少奇犯下的一宗罪行。
    两个儿子，两种思想感情。一天，队里派丙乾出粪坑，丙乾拿着铁锨走到粪坑边，看到里边沤得又臭又脏，围着粪坑转了两遭，没法下脚，又转了两遭，还是没法下脚，就嘟嘟囔囔地说：“真倒霉，派我干这活，我不挣这个工分了。”拉着铁锨就走。丙臣看到哥哥不愿意出粪，就从他手里夺过铁锨，挽了挽裤腿，跳到粪坑里，大锨大锨干起来，弄了两腿粪，出了满头大汗。贫下中农表扬说：“还是咱附中班的学生，搁到哪里哪里中，浑身泥巴思想红。”丙乾在所谓“正规化”的学校，脱离贫下中农，上学的年数越多，离毛主席革命路线越远，脱离贫下中农就越厉害，变得不象贫农的儿子了。
    还有一回，麦收后的一天，丙乾和丙臣都去锄玉米地，丙臣在农技课上学过玉米定苗，锄得又快又好。丙乾累得满头大汗，锄得慢质量差。使人发笑的是，他间去的苗从五茬骨上边截下来，根都剩下，过了几天，一棵又长出两三棵，都成了“二露头”。这都是受了刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线流毒的影响。孩子把贫下中农会劳动、爱劳动的传家宝都给扔到九霄云外去了。
    从以上事实，不难看出，那些所谓重点学校，刘少奇修正主义教育路线影响很深，贫下中农孩子上几年学就变了样，满脑子资产阶级思想，日久年多就会变修。贫下中农管理的学校，步步按毛主席指示办事，他老人家咋说，俺就咋做，教育紧密结合三大革命运动，步步不离贫下中农，培养的学生能文能武，让他们接革命的班，掌革命的印，俺贫下中农才放心。
