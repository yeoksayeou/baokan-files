Hebei's vast revolutionary masses, under the unified leadership of revolutionary committees at all levels, have adopted the method of studying, summing up, and fighting simultaneously to seriously implement the communiqué of the Twelfth Plenum of the Party. This has further developed the revolutionary situation in the province and promoted a new high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

After the communiqué was issued, the Hebei Revolutionary Committee and revolutionary committees at all levels immediately issued notices, requiring all places to promptly set up various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, quickly launching a wave of studying, propagating, and implementing the communiqué throughout the province. Within three days, Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the communiqué as the central content were set up in various places and industries across the province. The broad revolutionary masses used the communiqué as a mirror to summarize their work, find gaps, formulate measures, and take immediate action to launch new battles.

In cities such as Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, Zhangjiakou, and Handan, factories, mines, and enterprises had achieved significant results in revolutionary criticism and the cleansing of class ranks in the previous period. Some people developed a sense of complacency, feeling that "it's good enough." Broad revolutionary workers, in light of the communiqué, summarized their work, found gaps, and immediately carried out further revolutionary criticism, launching a deeper attack on class enemies. Across the province, broad poor and lower-middle peasants, inspired by the communiqué, took local walking capitalists, traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries as live materials. They criticized above the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi's "three selfs and one package," "four freedoms," "work points as the commander," and "theory of the extinction of class struggle," and below exposed the crimes of class enemies in their own units, quickly pushing the rural revolutionary criticism to a new high tide.

Under the impetus of the plenum communiqué, the construction of revolutionary committees at all levels has been further strengthened. Before the communiqué was issued, revolutionary committees at the provincial, municipal, and county levels in Hebei, under the unified leadership of the provincial revolutionary committee, seriously implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, focusing on criticizing the bourgeois reactionary "theory of multiple centers." After the communiqué was issued, revolutionary committees at all levels in various regions and counties had an even clearer direction for the construction of revolutionary committees, carried out rectification activities, and further achieved the revolutionization of thought and organization. The Baoding Revolutionary Committee, during its rectification meeting, used the communiqué as a weapon to examine thoughts and work, finding four gaps: not grasping the Mao Zedong Thought study classes in rural areas tightly enough, not carrying out revolutionary criticism deeply and persistently enough, not cleansing class ranks harshly enough, and not grasping revolutionary education forcefully enough. They immediately formulated measures, starting from strengthening the revolutionization of the revolutionary committees, to further carry out struggle, criticism, and transformation.

The communiqué further mobilized the broad revolutionary masses in cities and countryside to participate in the rectification and construction of the Party, accelerating the pace of rectification and construction. Broad workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, after studying the communiqué, further realized the great significance of carrying out the rectification and construction of the Party according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and participated in the rectification and construction of the Party more actively and enthusiastically. Many workers in factories and poor and lower-middle peasants in rural areas voluntarily formed part-time investigation teams, conducting thematic investigations on the influence of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line on the construction of the Party in their own units, as well as the problems in the current rectification and construction of the Party, promoting the progress of rectification and construction.

The communiqué greatly inspired the revolutionary enthusiasm of broad revolutionary cadres in Hebei to go down to the countryside for labor and receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers. In the past ten days or so, more than 4,000 cadres from the offices in Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, and Zhangjiakou have been approved to go down for labor.

After the communiqué was issued, cities and countryside across Hebei launched a new production high tide. Industrial production indicators in places such as Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, and Zhangjiakou have all increased significantly, and some factories have already completed this year's production tasks ahead of schedule. Broad poor and lower-middle peasants in rural areas have started water conservancy projects, land leveling, and fertilizer accumulation ahead of time, actively creating conditions for the great leap forward in agricultural production next year. Grain and cotton procurement work has also been greatly accelerated. Counties such as Xingtang and Xingtai have completed their grain procurement tasks ahead of schedule and in excess. The progress of cotton procurement in the province is faster than in any previous year, with more than 80% of the procurement tasks completed by November 10.

　　河北广大革命群众认真落实全会公报推动斗批改出现新高潮
　　边学习  边战斗  发展大好形势
    据新华社石家庄十四日电　河北省广大工人、贫下中农和革命群众在各级革命委员会的统一领导下，采用边学习、边总结、边战斗的方法，认真落实党的十二中全会公报，进一步发展了全省的革命大好形势，推动斗、批、改出现了新高潮。
    公报发表后，河北省革命委员会和各级革命委员会闻风而动，连夜发出通知，要求各地立即大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，在全省迅速掀起学习、宣传、落实公报的热潮。不到三天，以学习和落实公报为中心内容的毛泽东思想学习班就在全省各地各行各业普遍办起来。广大革命群众以公报为镜子，总结工作，找出差距，制订措施，立即行动，展开新的战斗。
    石家庄、唐山、张家口、邯郸等城市的厂矿企业，前一段革命大批判、清理阶级队伍等项工作取得了很大成绩，有些人就滋长了自满情绪，觉得“差不多了”，广大革命职工对照公报总结工作，找出差距，立即进一步开展革命大批判，更加深入地展开了对阶级敌人的进攻。全省各地广大贫下中农在公报的鼓舞下，纷纷以当地的走资派、叛徒、特务和反革命分子为活材料，上批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“工分挂帅”和“阶级斗争熄灭论”等反革命修正主义路线，下揭本单位阶级敌人的罪行，很快把农村的革命大批判推向一个新的高潮。
    在全会公报的推动下，各级革命委员会的建设也有了进一步加强。公报发表之前，河北省地、县各级革命委员会就在省革命委员会的统一领导下，认真落实毛主席一系列最新指示，集中地批判了资产阶级反动的“多中心论”。公报发表后，各地区、县的各级革命委员会更加明确了革委会建设的方向，开展了整风活动，进一步实现思想革命化和组织革命化。宝坻县革命委员会在整风会议上，以公报为武器，检查思想和工作，找出了对农村毛泽东思想学习班抓得还不紧，革命大批判开展得不够深入持久，清理阶级队伍还抓得不狠，教育革命还抓得不够有力等四条差距，立即制定措施，从加强革委会的革命化入手，进一步搞好斗、批、改。
    公报还进一步动员了城乡广大革命群众参加整党建党工作，加快了整党建党的步伐。广大工人、贫下中农学习了公报，进一步认识到按照毛主席的指示搞好整党建党工作的伟大意义，更加积极热情地参加整党建党工作。许多工厂的工人和农村的贫下中农，自动组成业余调查小组，对刘少奇的反革命修正主义建党路线在本单位的影响，以及当前整党建党工作中的问题，进行专题调查，推动了整党建党工作的进行。
    公报大大鼓舞了河北省广大革命干部下放劳动，接受工农兵再教育的革命热情。最近十多天来，仅石家庄、唐山、张家口三个地区，就有四千多名机关干部被批准下放劳动。
    河北各地城乡在公报发表后，普遍掀起了新的生产高潮。石家庄、唐山、张家口等地工业战线的各项生产指标都有大幅度增长，目前已有一批工厂提前完成今年全年的生产任务。农村广大贫下中农提前开始兴修水利工程、平整土地和积肥，积极为明年的农业生产大跃进创造条件。粮棉征购工作也大大加快。行唐、藁城等县已提前超额完成了粮食征购任务。全省棉花收购进度比历史上任何一年都快，到十一月十日已完成收购任务的百分之八十以上。
