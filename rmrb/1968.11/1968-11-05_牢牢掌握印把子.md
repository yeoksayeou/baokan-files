On the evening of November 1st, the radio broadcast a piece of exhilarating news: the Eighth Plenary Session of the Twelfth Enlarged Meeting of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party unanimously passed a resolution to expel the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi from the party permanently, revoke all his party and non-party positions, and continue to expose the crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices in betraying the party and the country. After hearing this wise decision of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Twelfth Enlarged Meeting of the Central Committee, we poor and lower-middle peasants were all overjoyed and clapped our hands in approval. We repeatedly shouted: Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power." Before liberation, we poor and lower-middle peasants suffered endless exploitation and oppression from the landlord class. Throughout the year, we could not eat enough or dress warmly. Many people were driven to desperation, separated from their families, and their homes destroyed. My father, Mao Fuxian, was one of the first batch of communists personally recruited by Chairman Mao in Shaoshan and served as the first secretary of the Shaoshan Party branch. Later, he was brutally murdered by the evil Kuomintang reactionaries in Nanjing's Rainflower Terrace. After my father's death, my mother was forced to work in Changsha as a female worker and suffered endless oppression from the capitalists. My three siblings and I followed our grandmother begging for food. When I was nine years old, I was forced to herd cows for the landlord. The evil landlord did not treat me like a human, beating and scolding me all day.

In the old society, why were we poor and lower-middle peasants treated like cattle and horses by the landlords? Why could the landlords act so arrogantly? The fundamental reason is that the seal of power was in the hands of the landlord class, and they monopolized our political power!

Our great leader Chairman Mao led the people to revolt, overthrowing the three big mountains that had been oppressing us. We poor and lower-middle peasants stood up. During the land reform, my family was allocated land and a house. After the cooperative and people's commune movements, my family's life improved day by day. Who gave us this happy life today? It was Chairman Mao who gave it to us. It was Chairman Mao who let us grasp the seal of power, and we have today. The heavens and the earth are not as great as Chairman Mao's kindness. Parents are not as dear as Chairman Mao. We poor and lower-middle peasants will never forget Chairman Mao's kindness, generation after generation, and will always follow Chairman Mao to make the revolution.

The clique of revisionists within the party led by Liu Shaoqi, representing the interests of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, have always opposed Chairman Mao, opposed Mao Zedong Thought, and opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They attempted to usurp the party, the army, and the government, aiming to restore capitalism. In the countryside, they vigorously advocated "three autonomies and one contract" and "four freedoms," attempting to make us poor and lower-middle peasants retrace our steps and suffer again. We poor and lower-middle peasants will never agree to this, not in a thousand ways, not in ten thousand ways!

I am a poor and lower-middle peasant from Chairman Mao's hometown. I will definitely inherit the will of the revolutionary martyrs, carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition of the people of Shaoshan, closely follow our great leader Chairman Mao, and bravely advance. I will resolutely respond to the battle call issued by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Twelfth Enlarged Meeting of the Central Committee, seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We will definitely firmly grasp the seal of power, making the socialist iron mountain unchangeable for generations.

    牢牢掌握印把子
    中共韶山支部第一任支部书记毛福轩烈士的儿子、共产党员、贫农社员　毛迪秋
    十一月一日晚上，广播里传来了一个振奋人心的特大喜讯：中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会一致通过决议，把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外的一切职务，并继续清算刘少奇及其同伙叛党叛国的罪行。听了党的八届十二中全会的这一英明决议以后，我们贫下中农无不欢欣鼓舞，拍手称快。大家一遍又一遍高呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”解放以前，我们贫下中农受尽了地主阶级的剥削和压迫，一年到头，吃不饱，穿不暖。多少人被逼得走投无路，妻离子散，家破人亡。我的父亲毛福轩，是毛主席在韶山亲自发展的第一批共产党员之一，担任过韶山党支部第一任支部书记，后来被万恶的国民党反动派残酷杀害在南京雨花台。父亲死后，我母亲被迫到长沙作女工，受尽了资本家的欺压。我们兄妹三人跟着祖母讨饭过日。我九岁的时候，就被迫给地主放牛。万恶的地主不把我当人看，整天打我骂我。
    在旧社会，为什么我们贫下中农被地主当作牛马？为什么地主能够横行霸道？根本的原因，就是因为印把子掌握在地主阶级手里，他们专了我们的政！
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席，领导人民起来闹革命，推翻了压在我们头上的三座大山，我们贫下中农翻了身。土改时，我家分得了土地和房屋。经过合作化和人民公社化以后，我家的生活一天比一天好起来。我们今天的幸福生活是谁给的？是毛主席给的，是毛主席让我们掌握了印把子，我们才有今天。天大地大不如毛主席的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲。我们贫下中农世世代代不忘毛主席的恩情，世世代代紧跟毛主席闹革命。
    以刘少奇为首的党内一小撮走资派，代表帝国主义、现代修正主义和国民党反动派的利益，一贯反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，妄图篡党、篡军、篡政，实现资本主义复辟。在农村，他们拚命鼓吹“三自一包”“四大自由”，妄图使我们贫下中农走回头路，吃二遍苦。我们贫下中农一千个不答应，一万个不答应！
    我是毛主席家乡的贫下中农，我一定要继承革命先烈的遗志，发扬韶山人民的光荣革命传统，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席奋勇前进，坚决响应党的八届扩大的十二中全会向我们发出的战斗号召，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。我们一定牢牢掌握印把子，使社会主义铁打江山千秋万代永不变色。
