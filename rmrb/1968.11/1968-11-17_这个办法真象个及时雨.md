	“This method is like a timely rain”

	Editor,

	We, the representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants, cadres of production brigades and communes, and revolutionary teachers attending the conference on the management of schools by the poor and lower-middle peasants in Jishan County, were immediately stirred up upon hearing the broadcast of the suggestion by comrades Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu to transfer the public primary schools to the production brigades for management. Everyone was overjoyed and applauded enthusiastically. This method is like a timely rain, expressing our innermost thoughts and solving a long-standing problem for us in managing schools. To seize the power of culture, we must first seize the power over personnel. Now that the public primary schools are transferred to the production brigades for management, we poor and lower-middle peasants not only manage politics and teaching but also personnel affairs. In this way, the power of education is truly in the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants. We are determined that upon returning to the communes and production brigades, we will establish various types of classes to study the thoughts of Mao Zedong, to fully implement the transfer of public primary schools to the production brigades for management, and to complete the great historical task of the educational revolution. We will follow the great leader Chairman Mao and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

　　“这个办法真象个及时雨”
　　编辑同志：
    我们稷山县贫下中农管理学校大会与会的贫下中农代表、社队干部和革命教师一听到侯振民、王庆余二同志将公办小学下放到大队来办的建议广播以后，立即沸腾起来。人人欢欣鼓舞，个个拍手叫好。这个办法真象个及时雨，说出了咱们心里话，把我们贫下中农管理学校的一个“老大难”问题解决了。要掌握文权，首先要掌握人权。这下可好了，公办小学下放到大队来办，我们贫下中农不仅管政治、管教学，而且管人事，这样作，教育大权就真正掌握在贫下中农手中了。我们决心回到公社和大队后，大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，为全面实行将公办小学下放到大队来办，为完成教育革命这个伟大的历史任务，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
