To achieve the proletarian education revolution, it is essential to have the leadership of the working class, the participation of the working masses, and the cooperation of the PLA soldiers with the students, teachers, and workers in the school who are determined to carry the proletarian education revolution through to the end. The worker-propaganda teams must stay in the schools for the long term, participate in all the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and permanently lead the schools. In the countryside, the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants—should manage the schools.

The Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Must Seize Control of Cultural Power

Editor's Note: The central issue in the rural education revolution is whether the poor and lower-middle peasants can seize control of educational power. The best thing about the people-run schools is that after the poor and lower-middle peasants take over the management of the schools, they can fundamentally put an end to the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling the schools and cultivate successors to the revolutionary cause according to the needs of the proletariat, ensuring the implementation of Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line. From the several critical articles from Guangzong County, Hebei Province, published below, one can clearly see this point.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction means criticism, means revolution." To truly manage the rural schools well, the poor and lower-middle peasants must thoroughly criticize the counterrevolutionary revisionist educational line pushed by the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi. Only by eliminating its poisonous influence in the course of criticism can one firmly seize control of the schools and run them better.

After liberation, although the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in our county had turned over in politics and economics, they were still in a position of being excluded and suppressed in culture. The great traitor Liu Shaoqi and his agents in our county installed a handful of exploiting class elements and remnants of the Kuomintang in the schools, excluding the children of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants from the school gates. In 1965, the Chengguan Primary School had a fifth-grade class with a total of 45 students, of which only 7 were children of poor and lower-middle peasants, accounting for 15% of the entire class. Many children of poor and lower-middle peasants left school in anger because they could not advance to the fifth grade. In the Sunzhuang Production Brigade of the Zhao Village People's Commune, in 18 years, not a single child of a poor and lower-middle peasant had attended middle school, and to this day, not even a poor and lower-middle peasant accountant can be found. Under the control of bourgeois intellectuals, the schools were seriously detached from proletarian politics, from the workers and peasants, and from production practice, using bourgeois ideology to poison the students. In the Chengguan Primary School, two children of cadres, because they did not participate in labor for a long time, went to the fields to cut grass and could not even tell the difference between grass and seedlings, resulting in cutting two baskets of sorghum seedlings for the production team. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants saw with their own eyes and hated with their hearts the counterrevolutionary revisionist educational line of Liu Shaoqi; they were even more indignant that their children were harmed by the revisionist educational line.

As the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution deepened, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary teachers and students in our county, following Chairman Mao's instructions on the education revolution, launched a fierce attack on Liu Shaoqi's counterrevolutionary revisionist educational line. The poor and lower-middle peasants recounted the bitterness of having no right to education and no culture in the old society and exposed with a large number of facts the heinous crimes of Liu Shaoqi's counterrevolutionary revisionist educational line. The poor and lower-middle peasants pointed out: the counterrevolutionary revisionist educational line opened the door for the children of landlords and rich peasants and set up numerous barriers for the children of poor and lower-middle peasants to enter school: age barrier, score barrier, promotion barrier, tuition barrier, distance barrier. One barrier after another, it is really difficult to pass. If one cannot pass a barrier, one is locked out of the school gate. In 1960, the Dongli Middle School admitted a total of 27 students from one commune and one brigade, but within a few days of enrollment, 17 poor and lower-middle peasant children were forced to drop out. In the Yancang Primary School of Chengguan People's Commune, a child of a poor and lower-middle peasant entered school at the age of seven, spent two years in each grade, and at the age of eighteen, still had not graduated from primary school. His grandfather said, "My child will have a beard by the time he goes to middle school." The poor and lower-middle peasants angrily said, "For whom is the school open? Isn't it clear?" The poor and lower-middle peasants sharply criticized the schools controlled by bourgeois intellectuals: "Children go to school for eight or nine years, cannot write a letter, cannot do accounts, become lazier the more they study, call them to work and they stare blankly, send them to college and they should be supported, such schools should be smashed!"

Our county has a total of 12 communes and 211 production brigades. Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the entire county had three middle schools, 23 junior high schools, and 179 primary schools. There were also 9 villages without schools. The enrollment rate of school-age children was only 69%, of which children of poor and lower-middle peasants accounted for 43% of the enrolled children. A large number of children of poor and lower-middle peasants were excluded from the school gates.

The shocking facts made the poor and lower-middle peasants clearly see the reactionary nature of Liu Shaoqi's counterrevolutionary revisionist educational line. They fiercely criticized in various types of study classes the reactionary ideas such as "grades first," "promotion first," "academics first," and "study to be an official" spread by Liu Shaoqi and his gang, and together with revolutionary teachers and students, they carried out criticism in the fields, on the streets, and in the families. Through criticism, they had an even deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's instruction that "the school system must be shortened, education must be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools must not be allowed to continue." The broader the poor and lower-middle peasants criticized the counterrevolutionary revisionist educational line, the more they hated it, the more they loved Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, and the more they were eager to seize control of cultural power and manage the schools well.

Following Chairman Mao's instructions, we combined the actual needs of the three great revolutionary movements in the countryside and implemented the policy of transferring primary and middle schools to be directly managed by the poor and lower-middle peasants. We boldly reformed the rural educational system, popularized primary education, and junior high education.

After Chairman Mao's latest instruction that "in the countryside, the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants—should manage the schools" was issued, the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams immediately moved into all the primary and middle schools in the county, and strengthened the leadership organs of the communes and brigades that manage the schools, changing the original education revolution committees into poor and lower-middle peasant school management committees. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants managed the schools according to Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, abolished the old system, smashed the old institutions, and carried out a series of reforms in school education. Recently, according to the demands of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary teachers and students, we have transferred all three public middle schools in the county to be directly managed by the poor and lower-middle peasants. The 12 communes in the county have set up 25 senior high school classes, so that the children of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants can go from primary school to high school without leaving the commune. School education is closely integrated with the three great revolutionary movements, directly serving proletarian politics, and cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. The poor and lower-middle peasants happily said, "Mao Zedong Thought has entered the school, people have changed spirit, the school has changed appearance, the poor and lower-middle peasants have seized cultural power, and the school has been brought to the doorstep. This is the kind of school we poor and lower-middle peasants like."

    实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加，配合解放军战士，同学校的学生、教员、工人中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子实行革命的三结合。工人宣传队要在学校中长期留下去，参加学校中全部斗、批、改任务，并且永远领导学校。在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。
    贫下中农一定要掌握文权
    河北广宗县革命委员会
    编者按：农村教育革命的中心问题，是贫下中农把教育大权掌握在自己手里的问题。民办学校千好万好，最根本的一好，就是贫下中农管理学校以后，从根本上结束了资产阶级知识分子统治学校的现象，能够按照无产阶级的需要，培养革命事业接班人，保证贯彻毛主席的无产阶级教育路线。我们从下面发表的河北省广宗县的几篇批判文章中，可以清楚地看到这点。
    毛主席教导我们：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。”贫下中农要真正把农村的学校管理好，必须彻底批判叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇所推行的反革命修正主义教育路线。只有在批判中肃清其流毒，才能牢靠地掌握学校的大权，才能把学校越办越好。
    我县在解放以后，广大贫下中农虽然在政治上、经济上翻了身，但在文化上仍然处于受排斥、遭打击的地位，大叛徒刘少奇及其在我县的代理人，把一小撮剥削阶级分子和国民党的残渣余孽安插在学校，把广大贫下中农子女排斥在学校大门之外。一九六五年城关完小一个高小班，共招收学生四十五名，其中贫下中农子女仅有七名，占全班学生的百分之十五，不少贫下中农子女因为升不上高小愤慨地离开了学校。赵寨公社孙庄大队，十八年来，没有一个贫下中农的子女上过中学，到现在连个贫下中农会计也找不到。在资产阶级知识分子把持下的学校，严重地脱离无产阶级政治，脱离工农群众，脱离生产实际，用资产阶级思想来毒害学生。城关完小有两个干部子女，因为长期不参加劳动，到地里去割草，连草和苗也分不清，结果割了生产队的两筐高粱苗回来了。对刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线，广大贫下中农看在眼里，恨在心里；对自己的子女遭受修正主义教育路线的毒害，贫下中农更加气愤。
    随着无产阶级文化大革命的深入开展，我县广大贫下中农，广大革命师生，遵照毛主席关于教育革命的指示，大造了刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线的反。贫下中农大诉旧社会无权受教育和无文化的苦，用大量的事实揭露了刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线的滔天罪行。贫下中农指出：反革命修正主义教育路线为地主富农子女开门，为贫下中农子女入学设置了重重关卡：年龄关，分数关，升学关，学费关，路程关。一关又一关，过关真是难。一关过不去，就被关到校门外边。件只公社件只大队一九六○年考上董里初中的共二十七人，入学不几天，就有十七名贫下中农子女被迫退了学。城关公社盐场小学，一个贫下中农的孩子七岁入学，每个年级上两年，上到十八岁小学还没毕业。他祖父说：“俺孩子上到中学就该长胡子了。”贫下中农气愤地说：“学校到底为谁开门，不是很清楚吗？”贫下中农对资产阶级知识分子统治的学校提出了尖锐的批评：“孩子上学八、九年，信写不成，账不会算，越上越懒，一叫干活白瞪眼，上到大学就该供起来啦，这样的学校早该砸烂！”
    我县共有十二个公社，二百一十一个大队。无产阶级文化大革命以前，全县共有三所中学，高完小二十三所，初小一百七十九所。还有九个未设学校的白点村。学龄儿童入学率仅达百分之六十九，其中贫下中农子女占入学儿童的百分之四十三。大批贫下中农子女被排斥在学校大门之外。
    触目惊心的事实，使贫下中农清楚地看到了刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线的反动本质。他们在各种类型的学习班里狠批了刘少奇一伙所散布的“分数挂帅”、“升学第一”、“智育第一”、“读书做官”等种种反动思想，并且在田间，在街头，在家庭，和革命师生一起进行批判。通过批判，更加深刻地认识到毛主席“学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了”指示的伟大意义。广大贫下中农越批对反革命修正主义教育路线越恨，对伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级教育路线越爱，越批对掌好文权、管理好学校的劲头越足。
    我们遵照毛主席的教导，结合农村三大革命运动的实际需要，实行了小学、中学下放由贫下中农直接管理，大胆地改革了农村教育体制，普及了小学教育，初中教育。
    毛主席的最新指示“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校”发表后，贫下中农毛泽东思想宣传队立即进驻了全县的农村中小学，并充实加强了社、队管理学校的领导机构，将原来的教育革命委员会，改为贫下中农管理学校委员会。广大贫下中农按照毛主席的无产阶级教育路线管理学校，废除了旧体制，砸烂了旧制度，对学校教育进行了一系列的改革。最近，根据广大贫下中农和革命师生的要求，我们将全县的三处公办中学全部下放由贫下中农直接管理。全县十二个公社分设了二十五个高中班，这样就可做到广大贫下中农子女从小学到高中全不出公社。学校教育紧密与三大革命运动相结合，直接为无产阶级政治服务，培养造就无产阶级革命事业接班人。贫下中农高兴地说：“毛泽东思想进了校，人换精神校换貌，贫下中农掌文权，学校办到家门口。这才是咱贫下中农喜欢的学校。”
