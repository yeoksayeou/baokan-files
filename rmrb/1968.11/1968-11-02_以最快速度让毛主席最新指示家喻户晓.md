Huaiyin County has established a "Red Line" (communication network) to convey Mao Zedong's latest instructions. The county and commune revolutionary committees have set up duty rooms, with personnel on duty around the clock, listening to important news broadcasts from the Central People's Broadcasting Station every day. They have also selected a group of revolutionary warriors who are absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong and full of vigor, forming a red communication team. As soon as they hear Mao Zedong's latest instructions, they immediately disseminate them downwards, ensuring that everyone is informed.

According to a report from our newspaper, in September of this year, the Huaiyin County Revolutionary Committee in Jiangsu Province established a "Red Line" (communication network) throughout the county to convey Mao Zedong's latest instructions and the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters from top to bottom.

Due to the dispersed nature of rural residences and poor broadcasting conditions, as well as the delayed arrival of newspapers, the previous method of relying solely on newspapers, telephones, and meetings to convey information could no longer fully meet the needs of the broad revolutionary masses to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought and keep up with Mao Zedong's great strategic deployments. The question of how to ensure that Mao Zedong's latest instructions are conveyed day and night, at any time, and passed down completely, without missing anyone, and keeping up without falling behind, is an urgent problem that needs to be solved. After repeated research and extensive consultation with the masses, the county revolutionary committee made a decision: to establish a "Red Line" throughout the county to convey Mao Zedong's latest instructions and the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters from top to bottom.

This "Red Line" is composed of four levels: county, commune, production brigade, and production team. The county and commune revolutionary committees have set up duty rooms, with personnel on duty around the clock, listening to important news broadcasts from the Central People's Broadcasting Station every day. They have also selected a group of revolutionary warriors who are absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong and full of vigor, forming a red communication team. As soon as they hear Mao Zedong's latest instructions, they immediately disseminate them downwards at the fastest speed. Each production brigade also established a duty system and, in nearby production teams, organized a strong red communication team with militia cadres as the backbone, ready to act swiftly. Upon receiving the latest instructions, they immediately go to the production teams with brigade cadres to convey the instructions. Each production team further established and improved the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, immediately conveying Mao Zedong's latest instructions to every household upon receipt.

After the establishment of the "Red Line," it was warmly welcomed and enthusiastically praised by the broad masses of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants throughout the county.

On the evening of October 15, the great leader Mao Zedong's two latest instructions on party rectification and party building were transmitted from Beijing via radio waves to Huaiyin County. The "Red Line" conveyed these two latest instructions to the 600,000 people of the entire county in just four or five hours, ensuring that everyone was informed. The red communication team from the county-level organs working in the Qianshu Commune's Forward Brigade and the county seed farm, upon hearing Mao Zedong's latest instructions, immediately set out despite the fatigue from a day's labor, beating drums and gongs, and rushing to over 200 production teams in more than 30 brigades across three communes to convey Mao Zedong's latest instructions to the broad poor and lower-middle peasants.

The broad poor and lower-middle peasants, seeing that the "Red Line" had promptly conveyed Mao Zedong's latest instructions, all excitedly said: "Mao Zedong issues instructions in Beijing, and we hear them very quickly. With this 'Red Line,' we can follow Mao Zedong's great strategic deployments more closely and more quickly." That night, a wave of studying, propagating, and implementing Mao Zedong's latest instructions swept across the entire county.

    以最快速度让毛主席最新指示家喻户晓
    淮阴县建成一条传达毛主席最新指示的“红色线路”（即通讯网）。县和公社革委会设立值班室，日夜不离人，每天按时收听中央人民广播电台的重要新闻节目，并挑选一批无限忠于毛主席、朝气蓬勃的无产阶级革命战士，组成红色通讯队伍，一听到毛主席最新指示，立即分头向下传达，做到人人皆知
    本报讯　今年九月，江苏省淮阴县革命委员会在全县范围内，从上到下建成了一条传达毛主席最新指示和无产阶级司令部战斗号令的“红色线路”（即通讯网）。
    由于农村居住分散，广播条件差，报纸到得迟，过去那种单纯靠报纸传，电话传，会议传的方法，已经不能完全适应广大革命人民群众活学活用毛泽东思想、紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的需要。如何确保毛主席的最新指示白天到白天传，夜里到夜里传，什么时间到什么时间传，并且一竿子传到底，做到传达不漏人，紧跟不掉队，是当前迫切需要解决的重要问题。县革委会经过反复研究，广泛征求群众意见以后作出决定：在全县范围内从上到下建立一条传达毛主席最新指示和无产阶级司令部战斗号令的“红色线路”。
    这条“红色线路”是由县、公社、大队和生产队四级组成的。县和公社革委会设立值班室，日夜不离人，每天按时收听中央人民广播电台的重要新闻节目，并挑选了一批无限忠于毛主席、朝气蓬勃的无产阶级革命战士，组成红色通讯队伍，一听到毛主席最新指示，就以最快的速度，分头向下传达。各大队也建立值班制度，并在就近生产队以基干民兵为骨干，组织一个召之即来、雷厉风行的坚强的红色通讯队伍，在接到最新指示后，就和大队干部一起分头到生产队传达。各生产队都进一步建立和健全了毛泽东思想宣传队，一接到毛主席最新指示，立即传达到各户社员。
    “红色线路”建成以后，受到了全县广大工人群众和广大贫下中农的热烈欢迎和热情赞扬。
    十月十五日晚上，伟大领袖毛主席关于整党、建党的两条最新指示，从北京通过电波传到淮阴县之后，“红色线路”仅在短短的四、五个小时之内，就把这两条最新指示传达给全县六十万人民，做到家喻户晓，人人皆知。下放在渔沟公社前进大队和县良种场劳动的县级机关的红色通讯队伍，一听到毛主席最新指示，就不顾白天劳动的疲劳，马上全部出动，敲锣打鼓，奔赴三个公社的三十多个大队二百多个生产队，向广大贫下中农传达了毛主席的最新指示。
    广大贫下中农看到“红色线路”及时地把毛主席最新指示传下来，都激动地说：“毛主席在北京发指示，我们很快就听到了。有了这条‘红色线路’，毛主席的伟大战略部署，我们就跟得更紧，跟得更快了。”当天夜里，在全县范围内，立即出现了一个学习、宣传、落实毛主席最新指示的热潮。
