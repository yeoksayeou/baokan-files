The poor and lower-middle peasants of the famous brigade for studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts, Hongjing Brigade of Shahe People's Commune in Taicang County, Jiangsu Province, while studying the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, linked the actual two-line struggle in their brigade, and severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the traitor, internal spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, further raising the consciousness of the revolutionary masses in the brigade in class struggle and two-line struggle.

Great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Historical experience is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, should be repeatedly spoken. It is not enough to speak to a few people; it must be made known to the broad revolutionary masses." Recently, while studying the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongjing Brigade once again reviewed the fierce struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in their brigade, further recognizing that the bourgeois headquarters represented by Liu Shaoqi spared no effort to cut down the red flag of Hongjing Brigade, which shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. Their evil purpose was to oppose the revolutionary people from mastering Mao Zedong Thought and to oppose the revolutionary masses from implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. This is a concrete manifestation of the two-line struggle.

In the autumn of 1965, the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao sent the People's Liberation Army to help Hongjing Brigade carry out the "Four Cleanups" movement and to initiate the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. However, Liu Shaoqi and his agents were terrified and hated the revolutionary masses studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. A small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Taicang County Committee, following Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods "Peach Garden Experience," created a "model" and another "model" emphasizing production, attempting to suppress Hongjing and sabotage the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. They also spread rumors and maliciously attacked the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Hongjing Brigade for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought as "formalism."

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongjing Brigade, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, stood firm against the vicious sabotage and attacks of the class enemies. They said, "Food can be skipped for a day, but Chairman Mao's books cannot be skipped for a day." "No matter how busy production is, studying Chairman Mao's works cannot be forgotten for a moment." They further carried out the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. They insisted on treating all time as time for studying Mao Zedong Thought and all occasions as classrooms for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. Illiterate poor and lower-middle peasants, in order to learn the "Three Articles," actively moved to the homes of literate poor and lower-middle peasants to live, using early and late hours to ask for help in learning. Elderly people with poor memory, in order to learn a line from Chairman Mao, repeatedly asked others to teach them until they understood and memorized it.

In October 1966, Vice Chairman Lin issued the important directive to "raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage." The poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongjing Brigade immediately implemented it upon hearing the news. At this time, the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party who had not yet been overthrown came to Hongjing to poison the atmosphere, exerting pressure on Hongjing Brigade by saying that Vice Chairman Lin's directive was for the military and that the local areas only needed to mention it in passing. They attempted to obstruct Hongjing Brigade from implementing Vice Chairman Lin's directive. Facing the pressure from the class enemies, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongjing Brigade carried out a head-on struggle. Under the leadership of the brigade Party branch, they launched a new high tide of studying and applying the "Three Articles" during the busy autumn season, pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to a new stage and shattering the class enemies' plot to sabotage the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

Under the warm care of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, this advanced collective of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, Hongjing Brigade, has been advancing in the storms of class struggle. Revolutionary people from all over the place flocked to Hongjing to learn from their advanced experience and draw revolutionary strength. Facing this revolutionary action of the revolutionary people, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party were again at a loss. They used their usurped power to arrogantly obstruct the active elements of Hongjing Brigade from going to other places to speak about their experiences; they blocked revolutionary people from other places from coming to Hongjing to visit and learn; they did not allow newspapers to publish the experiences of the poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongjing Brigade in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. What was even more outrageous was that they did not allow Comrade Gu Atiao to report to the broad masses the great news that the great leader Chairman Mao was in extremely good health. On National Day in 1966, Gu Atiao went to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebrations. Upon her return to Taicang, she was filled with boundless joy and wanted to share the great news of Chairman Mao's extremely good health with the broad revolutionary masses. However, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party maliciously obstructed Gu Atiao from reporting to the masses. They even did not allow Gu Atiao to pass through Taicang County town and issued an order prohibiting her from meeting with the broad revolutionary masses throughout the county. Comrade Gu Atiao paid no heed to this. She resolutely reported to several thousand revolutionary masses the great news that the great leader Chairman Mao was in extremely good health and conveyed Vice Chairman Lin's directive.

The communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party pointed out: "Over the past two years, the history of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has been permeated with the fierce struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines." In Hongjing, it was exactly like this. As soon as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongjing Brigade, following Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, first raised the revolutionary banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against the reactionaries" and launched a fierce attack on the bourgeois headquarters represented by Liu Shaoqi and their agents in the local area. Facing the surging revolutionary tide, the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the old Taicang County Committee sensed that their end was near. In order to maintain their reactionary rule, they frantically promoted their black master Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large number and protecting a small number," attempting to shift the direction of the struggle and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. At this critical moment, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongjing Brigade, who were infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, opened the red book and repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution." Chairman Mao's teachings gave them great courage and strength for the struggle. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, they, together with the revolutionary cadres, thoroughly smashed the plot of a small clique of class enemies in Hongjing to promote the bourgeois reactionary line.

The broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Hongjing Brigade, in light of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, reviewed the course of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in their brigade, and loved the great leader Chairman Mao even more infinitely and hated the traitor, internal spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi even more deeply. They deeply realized that only by thoroughly criticizing and exposing Liu Shaoqi and cleansing his counter-revolutionary revisionist thoughts could they consolidate the achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and ensure that the country would never change color. They implemented the battle call issued by the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to "continue to deeply carry out the revolutionary criticism and struggle." The entire brigade set up battlefields everywhere to criticize Liu Shaoqi. They combined the thorough criticism of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line with the thorough establishment of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and more consciously studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, launching a new high tide of the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

    洪泾大队贫下中农带着对大叛徒刘少奇无比仇恨的心情
    联系本大队两条路线斗争的实际  肃清刘少奇反革命修正主义思想
    据新华社南京二十六日电　著名的活学活用毛泽东思想先进集体——江苏省太仓县沙溪公社洪泾大队的广大贫下中农和革命干部，在学习党的八届十二中全会公报的时候，联系本大队两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的实际，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，进一步提高了全队革命群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”最近，洪泾大队的贫下中农在学习党的八届十二中全会公报的时候，又一次回顾了本大队两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争，进一步认识到以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级司令部千方百计要砍掉洪泾大队这面闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的红旗，其罪恶目的就是为了反对革命人民掌握毛泽东思想，反对革命群众贯彻毛主席的革命路线，这是两条路线斗争的一个具体表现。
    一九六五年秋天，以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部派来了亲人解放军，帮助洪泾大队开展“四清”运动，帮助洪泾大队掀起了活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动。但是，刘少奇及其代理人对革命群众活学活用毛泽东思想，怕得要死，恨得要命。太仓县委内的一小撮走资派，按照刘少奇的反革命修正主义黑货“桃园经验”制造了一个“典型”和另一个突出生产的“典型”，妄图压倒洪泾，破坏活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动。他们还在暗地里散布流言蜚语，恶毒攻击洪泾大队贫下中农和革命干部活学活用毛泽东思想是“形式主义”。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的洪泾大队的贫下中农顶住了阶级敌人的恶毒破坏和攻击，他们说，“饭可以一天不吃，毛主席的书不能一天不读。”“生产千忙万忙，学习毛主席著作一时一刻不能忘。”他们进一步开展了活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动。他们坚持把一切时间都当作学习毛泽东思想的时间，把一切场合都当作活学活用毛泽东思想的课堂。不识字的贫下中农为了学好“老三篇”，主动搬到识字的贫下中农家里去住，利用早晚时间请人帮助学习。记忆力较差的老年人，为了学好毛主席的一条语录，一次又一次地找人教，直到学懂记牢为止。
    一九六六年十月，林副主席发出“把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新的阶段”的重要指示。洪泾大队贫下中农闻风而动，立即贯彻。这时，还未被拉下马的党内一小撮走资派又到洪泾放毒，对洪泾大队施加压力，胡说什么林副主席“这个指示是给军内的，地方上只要结合讲讲就行了”，妄图阻止洪泾大队贯彻落实林副主席的这一指示。面对阶级敌人的压力，洪泾大队的广大贫下中农进行了针锋相对的斗争。他们在大队党支部的领导下，在秋季大忙中掀起了一个大学、大用“老三篇”的新高潮，把活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动推向了崭新的阶段，粉碎了阶级敌人破坏活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的阴谋。
    在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的亲切关怀下，洪泾大队这个活学活用毛泽东思想的先进集体，在阶级斗争的风浪中不断前进。各地革命人民纷纷到洪泾学习先进经验，吸取革命力量。面对革命人民的这一革命行动，党内一小撮走资派又慌了手脚。他们利用窃取的权力，狂妄地阻止洪泾活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子到外地去讲用；阻拦外地的革命群众到洪泾来参观学习；不让报纸发表洪泾大队的贫下中农活学活用毛泽东思想的经验。更令人愤慨的是他们不让顾阿桃同志向广大群众报告伟大领袖毛主席身体非常非常健康的大喜讯。一九六六年国庆节，顾阿桃到北京参加国庆观礼，她回到太仓后，满怀无限喜悦的心情，要把毛主席身体非常健康的喜讯告诉给广大革命群众。但是，党内一小撮走资派恶毒地阻挠顾阿桃向群众报告，他们居然不让顾阿桃经过太仓县城，并且下禁令，不准她同全县广大革命群众见面。顾阿桃同志根本不理这一套。她毅然决然地向好几千革命群众报告了伟大领袖毛主席身体非常非常健康的特大喜讯，传达了林副主席的指示。
    党的八届十二中全会公报指出：“两年多来无产阶级文化大革命的历史，贯串着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的剧烈斗争。”在洪泾，正是这样。文化大革命一开始，洪泾大队广大贫下中农按照毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，首先高举“对反动派造反有理”的革命大旗，向以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级司令部及其在本地区的代理人，发起了猛烈进攻。在气势磅礴的革命浪潮面前，旧太仓县委内一小撮走资派预感到末日已经来临。他们为了维持自己的反动统治，疯狂推行他们黑主子刘少奇“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，妄图转移斗争大方向，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。在这尖锐时刻，无限忠于毛主席的洪泾贫下中农，打开红色宝书，反复学习毛主席的教导：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”毛主席的教导，给了他们巨大的斗争勇气和力量。他们在毛主席革命路线指引下，和革命干部一起，彻底粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人在洪泾推行资产阶级反动路线的阴谋。
    洪泾大队广大贫下中农和革命干部，对照党的八届十二中全会公报，回顾了本大队两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的历程，更加无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席，无比仇恨叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇。他们深刻地认识到，只有把刘少奇彻底批深批透，肃清他的反革命修正主义思想，才能巩固无产阶级文化大革命的成果，保证国家永不变色。他们把党的八届十二中全会发出的“继续深入展开革命大批判”的战斗号召落实到行动上。全大队处处摆开了批判刘少奇的战场。他们把大破刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线与大立毛主席的革命路线结合起来，更自觉地活学活用毛泽东思想，掀起了活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动的新高潮。
