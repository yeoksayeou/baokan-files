On the evening of November 1, the joyous news of the publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Twelfth Central Committee of the Party reached the Ili grasslands on the northwestern border of the motherland. The entire grassland erupted in joy! The herdsmen played the dombra and danced the "Long Live Chairman Mao Forever" dance, celebrating the publication of the plenum communiqué throughout the night.

The poor herdsmen and representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants from the Red Star People's Commune in Xinyuan County, who were attending a meeting at the commune's revolutionary committee, immediately discussed the communiqué after listening to it, turning the meeting into a grand gathering to study the communiqué and implement the great battle calls of the plenum. That night, 63-year-old old herdsman Bulerhan rushed back from the commune to the production brigade to spread the good news. From the commune to the production brigade, one had to cross a snow-capped mountain, ford two rivers, and walk over thirty li. Someone suggested he go the next morning. He said, "In the old society, I worked as a long-term laborer for the landlord for 37 years. It was Chairman Mao who saved me from the pit of fire and made me the master. But the big villain Liu Shaoqi wanted us to suffer again and push us back into the pit of fire. I hate him to the core. Now that the big villain Liu Shaoqi has been thoroughly overthrown, I am so happy that my heart is about to jump out. How can such a heart-warming piece of news be delayed until tomorrow to tell everyone!"

The Red Star People's Commune's propaganda team, composed of poor herdsmen and lower-middle peasants, immediately picked up their instruments, braved the biting cold wind, and traversed mountains and rivers. Along the way, they composed performances and rushed to the pastures dozens of li away to perform for the herdsmen and propagate the plenum communiqué.

Bayinbulat, a Kazakh herdsman living in a remote mountain valley, heard the news of the publication of the communiqué in the afternoon of the 2nd. Without even eating, he rushed to the Mao Zedong Thought study class organized by the production brigade. He shouted as he ran, "Good news, good news! The communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Twelfth Central Committee, chaired by Chairman Mao, has been published!" The poor herdsmen, upon hearing the news, jumped for joy and enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" They recalled Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line of not allowing the struggle and division against the landlords in the pastoral areas, and everyone was filled with indignation, eagerly denouncing and exposing the crimes of the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi. The Mao Zedong Thought study class immediately became a battlefield for denouncing Liu Shaoqi.

Bayinbulat returned from the study class, but he could not contain his excitement. He thought of the bitter history of the old society and the happiness of becoming the master of the state in the new society, and the two times he had the fortune of seeing the great leader Chairman Mao. He stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and said excitedly, "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! It is you who gave Bayinbulat life, it is you who nurtured Bayinbulat to grow up. Bayinbulat will forever love you and follow you to revolution for life!"

Late at night, Bayinbulat's family was still discussing how to implement the battle tasks proposed by the plenum and re-planning the study plan for the family's Mao Zedong Thought study class.

The sun rose from the east, and sunlight bathed the grasslands. Under the inspiration of the plenum communiqué, the vast number of Kazakh herdsmen are striding forward to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    辽阔草原传喜讯
    十一月一日晚，党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表的喜讯传到祖国西北边境的伊犁草原，整个草原欢腾起来了！牧民们弹起东布拉，跳起了“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆”的舞蹈，通宵欢庆全会公报的发表。
    正在新源县红星公社革委会参加会议的贫苦牧民、贫下中农代表收听了公报以后，立即进行讨论，使会议变成了学习公报和落实全会提出的伟大战斗号召的大会。六十三岁的老牧工布勒尔汉当夜从公社赶回生产队去传达喜讯。从公社到生产队，途中要翻过一座雪山，趟两道河，走三十多里路。有人劝他第二天清早走。他说：“旧社会我给牧主当了三十七年长工，是毛主席把我从火坑里救了出来，翻了身，作了主人。可是刘少奇这个大坏蛋要让我们受二遍苦，把我们重新推入火坑。我恨透了他，现在刘少奇这个大坏蛋永远被打倒了，我高兴得心都要跳出来了，这样大快人心的消息，怎么能等到明天再告诉大家！”
    红星公社由贫苦牧民、贫下中农组成的毛泽东思想宣传队，听到喜讯，立即背起乐器，迎着凛冽的寒风，跋山涉水，一边走，一边编排节目，赶到几十里外的牧场，给牧民表演，宣传全会公报。
    住在一个偏僻的山谷里的哈萨克牧民巴音布拉特，二日下午听到公报发表的消息，连饭都顾不得吃，就向生产大队举办的毛泽东思想学习班跑去，他边跑边喊：“喜讯，喜讯！毛主席亲自主持召开的八届十二中全会公报发表了！”贫苦牧民们听到这一消息，高兴得又蹦又跳，热烈欢呼“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”他们想起刘少奇在牧区推行的对牧主不准斗、不准分的反革命修正主义路线，人人满腔怒火，争先恐后地批判控诉叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的罪行，毛泽东思想学习班立刻成了声讨刘少奇的战场。
    巴音布拉特从学习班回来，怎么也按捺不住内心的激动。他想起了在旧社会的苦难家史，想起了在新社会当了国家的主人，两次见到伟大领袖毛主席的幸福情景，他站在毛主席像前激动地说：“毛主席啊，毛主席！是您给了巴音布拉特生命，是您把巴音布拉特哺育成长，巴音布拉特永远热爱您，永远紧跟您干一辈子革命！”
    深夜，巴音布拉特一家还在讨论怎样落实全会提出的战斗任务，重新制订家庭毛泽东思想学习班的学习计划。
    旭日从东方升起，阳光普照着草原。广大哈萨克牧民在全会公报的鼓舞下，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利奋勇前进！
