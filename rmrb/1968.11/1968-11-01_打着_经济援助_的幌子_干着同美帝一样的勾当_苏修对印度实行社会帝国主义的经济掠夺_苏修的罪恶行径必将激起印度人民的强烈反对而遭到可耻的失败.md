Under the guise of so-called "economic aid," the Soviet revisionist clique ruthlessly exploits the Indian people and plunders India's rich resources. Their actions in India are no different from those of American imperialism, fully exposing their true colors as social imperialists.

American imperialism provides India with so-called "surplus food," controlling India's economic lifelines. The "aid to India consortium" controlled by the Americans reviews India's government plans, budgets, and policies every year to see if they align with American interests. The Soviet revisionists also provide loans, equipment, and technical personnel to the Indian government to build some state-owned factories. From design and equipment installation to the supply of raw materials, the Soviet "aid" industrial projects are all handled by the Soviet revisionists, who also interfere with or control the management. Thus, India's important industrial sectors fall under Soviet control. Recently, the Soviet revisionists have even incorporated India's next "Five-Year Plan" into their own planning framework, making India's state-owned industries' investments, layouts, and operations all subject to Soviet control.

Whether it's American "aid" or Soviet "aid," the aid goes to a small group of bloodsuckers in India—the bureaucratic comprador bourgeoisie and large landlords who sit on the backs of the people. Dollars and rubles fatten them up, propping up their shaky rule, while the broad masses of laboring people suffer increasingly cruel exploitation from American and Soviet imperialism, making their lives even more miserable.

American loans to the Indian government stipulate that 80-90% of these loans must be used to buy American goods. The Soviet revisionists also stipulate that all loans given to the Indian government must be used to purchase goods from the Soviet Union. American loans to India openly demand 5-7% high interest rates. The Soviet revisionists' loans to India appear to have only a 2.5% interest rate, but in reality, the goods they sell to India are priced 20-30% higher than world market prices and are of poor quality. Therefore, the Soviet revisionists' loans are also ruthlessly exploitative high-interest loans.

American imperialism invests in India's private enterprises, transportation, and other sectors, using these enterprises to squeeze high profits from the Indian people. The Soviet revisionists mainly lend money to the Indian reactionary government to run state-owned enterprises, and then the Indian government, through taxation and other means, extracts money from the Indian people to repay the Soviet revisionists' debts. These state-owned enterprises are poorly managed, have low operating rates, and incur significant losses. Just from the accumulation of products, the losses in the 1966-67 fiscal year amounted to $1 million. Ultimately, all these losses are compensated by the blood and sweat of the broad masses of Indian laboring people, making their burdens even heavier.

The Bhilai Steel Plant, built with Soviet aid, is one of the four state-owned steel plants controlled by the Indian bureaucratic bourgeoisie, with ownership belonging to the Indian President. The Soviet revisionists sold poor-quality refractory materials to the Bhilai Steel Plant, resulting in the consumption of 1-3 times more refractory materials per ton of steel produced compared to Soviet domestic steel plants. The dozens of diesel engines shoved into this plant by the Soviets are clumsy and faulty, with maintenance costs five times higher than normal. The Soviets also buy the products of the Bhilai Steel Plant at low prices and resell them abroad, making profits in the process. The Soviet-aided Lanco Heavy Machinery Plant, with an investment of over $20 million, produced only $1 million worth of products in the seven years since its completion, resulting in enormous waste.

Like American imperialism, the Soviet revisionists exploit Asian and African countries through low-price purchases and high-price sales, engaging in unequal trade.

This year, the Soviet revisionists, along with British imperialism, took advantage of the crisis in India's jute industry to force the Indian government to sell jute at reduced prices. The Soviet revisionists insisted on reducing the export tax on jute by 30% before agreeing to long-term purchases. Additionally, to meet Soviet demands, the Indian government lowered the export prices of steel to the Soviet Union by 10-20%. The Indian reactionary government then used deceitful and coercive methods to shift these losses onto the laboring people.

Currently, the Soviet revisionists and American imperialists are colluding more intensely, striving to expand their respective footholds in India, intensifying their plunder, and jointly dividing India. The Americans mainly dump grain and other agricultural products into India, controlling the transportation, power, and private fertilizer and chemical industries. The Soviets control India's state capital in heavy industries such as steel, machinery, and power. The Americans had previously agreed to invest in building a state-owned Bokaro steel plant in India, but due to unresolved conditions, it was taken over by the Soviets.

Despite the Soviet revisionists' desperate attempts to conceal the true nature of their "aid" to India, more and more Indian revolutionary people are seeing through their true colors as social imperialists. The Indian revolutionary magazine "Liberation" Monthly put it well: "When Soviet revisionists strive to build the Soviet economy on the basis of profit motives, how can Soviet 'aid' be selfless? If the economic relations within this country are governed by the principle of buying low and selling high, how can its economic relations with a foreign country be governed by a contrary principle?" This passage clearly points out: The Soviet revisionists have restored capitalism at home, and they must engage in imperialist plunder abroad. The Soviet revisionists' social imperialist actions will inevitably provoke strong opposition from the Indian people and meet with a shameful failure.

    打着“经济援助”的幌子　干着同美帝一样的勾当
    苏修对印度实行社会帝国主义的经济掠夺
    苏修的罪恶行径必将激起印度人民的强烈反对而遭到可耻的失败
    新华社三十一日讯　本社记者报道：苏修叛徒集团打着所谓“经济援助”的幌子，残酷剥削印度人民，掠夺印度的丰富资源。它在印度的所作所为同美帝国主义一模一样，完全暴露了它的社会帝国主义的真面目。
    美帝国主义向印度提供所谓“剩余粮食”，控制了印度的经济命脉。美帝控制的“援印财团”，每年要审查印度政府的计划、预算、政策，看看是否符合美帝的利益。苏修也向印度政府提供贷款、设备、技术人员，为印度建立一些官办工厂。苏“援”工业，从设计、安装设备到原材料供应，都由苏修一手包办，连经营管理都由苏修插手或掌握。这样，印度的重要工业部门就控制在苏修手中。最近，苏修干脆把印度下一个“五年计划”，纳入它自己的计划轨道，使印度官办工业的投资、布局和经营，都受苏修控制。
    不论美“援”或是苏“援”，援助的都是印度一小撮大吸血鬼——骑在人民头上的官僚买办资产阶级和大地主。美元和卢布养肥了他们，支撑着他们摇摇欲坠的统治，而广大劳动人民却受到美帝苏修越来越残酷的剥削，生活更加悲惨。
    美帝贷款给印度政府，规定必须使用这些贷款的百分之八九十来买美国货。苏修也规定，印度政府拿了它的贷款，全部都要在苏联采购。美帝给印度的贷款，明目张胆地要百分之五到七的高利息。苏修给印度的贷款，表面上只要百分之二点五的利息，但是实际上，它卖给印度的货物，价格比世界市场价格高百分之二三十，而且质量很差。所以苏修的贷款，同样也是残酷地剥削印度人民的高利贷。
    美帝国主义向印度私营企业、交通运输业等部门投资，利用这些企业，从印度人民身上榨取高额利润。苏修主要是通过借钱给印度反动政府办官办企业，然后由印度政府通过收税等办法，从印度人民身上搜刮钱财去还苏修的债。这些官办企业管理很糟，开工率很低，亏本很多，仅仅由于产品的积压，在一九六六——六七年度的亏损就达一千万美元。而这些亏损，到头来统统都要由印度广大劳动人民的血汗来补偿，使他们的负担更加沉重。
    苏修帮助印度建立的比莱钢厂，是印度官僚资产阶级手中的四家官办钢厂之一，所有权属于印度总统。苏修把质量很坏的耐火材料，卖给比莱钢厂，结果每炼一吨钢消耗的耐火材料，比苏联本国钢厂多一到三倍。苏联塞给这个工厂的几十辆柴油机，又笨又坏，维修费用比正常的多五倍。苏联还低价收买比莱钢厂的产品，转卖给外国，从中赚钱。苏“援”兰奇重型机械厂，投资两千多万美元，但是在苏修和印度官僚的经营下，建成后七年内只生产了价值一百万美元的产品，浪费极大。
    同美帝国主义一样，苏修剥削亚非国家还采取低价买入、高价卖出的手段，搞不等价贸易。
    今年，苏修利用印度黄麻工业的危机，同美英帝国主义一起，要印度政府压价卖给它们黄麻。苏修迫使印度黄麻出口税每包削减百分之三十才肯长期购买。此外，印度政府为了满足苏修的要求，向苏联出口的钢铁价格压低了百分之十到二十。造成的损失，印度反动政府则用巧取豪夺的卑劣手段转嫁给劳动人民。
    目前，苏修和美帝正在加紧勾结，竭力扩大它们各自在印度的地盘，加紧掠夺，共同瓜分印度。美帝主要向印度倾销粮食和其它农产品，控制交通、运输、电力部门，向私营肥料、化学等工业投资。苏修控制印度官僚资本的钢铁、机械、动力等重工业部门。美帝曾经同意在印度投资修建一座官办的波卡罗大型钢厂，由于条件没有谈妥，也由苏修接了过去。
    尽管苏修拚命地掩饰它“援助”印度的实质，但是越来越多的印度革命人民看清了它的社会帝国主义的真面目。印度革命刊物《解放》月刊说得好：“当苏联修正主义者竭力使苏联的经济建立在利润动机的基础上的时候，苏联的‘援助’怎么可能是无私的呢？如果这个国家内部的经济关系是受低价买进高价卖出的原则支配，那么，它同一个外国的经济关系怎能受一个性质相反的原则指导呢？”这段话，一针见血地说明：苏修在国内实现了资本主义复辟，它一定要在国外实行帝国主义掠夺。苏修的社会帝国主义行径，必将激起印度人民的强烈反对，而遭到可耻的失败。
