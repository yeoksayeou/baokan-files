The Revolutionary Committee of Shenyang People's Paper Mill led the broad revolutionary masses of workers to start from the actual class struggle in their unit and carry out a thorough criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods of the traitor, spy, and renegade Liu Shaoqi. The class struggle awareness of the workers has been greatly enhanced, strongly promoting the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

The Revolutionary Committee of Shenyang People's Paper Mill, holding high the banner of revolutionary criticism, fully played the leading role of the working class, and started from the actual class struggle in their unit to carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism. The class struggle awareness of the broad masses of workers has been greatly enhanced, and the entire mill has launched a new high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation. The workers said well: "Revolutionary criticism under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful driving force for implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, a combat weapon of the Cultural Revolution, and an important link in the establishment of Mao Zedong Thought."

Emphasize Revolutionary Criticism in the Struggle, Criticism, and Transformation

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism, is revolution." The broad revolutionary masses of the People's Paper Mill, through their struggle practice, deeply realized that the entire process of struggle, criticism, and transformation is a process of thoroughly criticizing bourgeois ideology, establishing Mao Zedong Thought, criticizing the revisionist line, and establishing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Emphasizing revolutionary criticism is the key to doing a good job in struggle, criticism, and transformation.

After the establishment of the revolutionary committee of this mill, it was decided to reform the old system of personnel surplus and redundant bureaucracy. However, some comrades did not completely break with the old system in their minds and kept studying and studying, always circling around specific issues. Facing this situation, the stationed military propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought and the members of the revolutionary committee repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "streamlining administration" and "breaking first, establishing in the process." They deeply realized that without thoroughly criticizing the revisionist line of the traitor, spy, and renegade Liu Shaoqi in the construction of political power and enterprise management, it would be impossible to break through the redundant administrative system and do a good job in streamlining administration. Without destruction, there can be no construction; without criticism, there can be no reform, otherwise, it would slip to the wrong path. The revolutionary committee immediately held a revolutionary criticism study class with the content of "streamlining administration," mobilizing the revolutionary workers of the entire mill to hold high the great banner of the "Anshan Constitution" and carry out a mass criticism of the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev Liu Shaoqi in using the old system to oppose Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, persecute the masses of workers, and sabotage the revolutionary cause. The workers said: "The old system is a hotbed for the restoration of capitalism, a mountain on the heads of the workers, if we do not overthrow it, we will suffer twice, we must smash it to pieces!" The workers' criticism pointed out the harm of the old system in a penetrating way, which deeply educated the revolutionary committee, further realizing the great significance of streamlining administration. Everyone expressed their determination: firmly follow the path indicated by the "Anshan Constitution," resolutely reform the old system, thoroughly reform it. Through revolutionary criticism, the problems that were originally thought to be unsolvable were all solved one by one. The more thorough the criticism, the clearer the direction of reform. After the masses repeatedly and fully discussed, a reform plan that is beneficial to the establishment of a revolutionary and people-oriented new system and meets the actual needs of the unit was quickly put forward. It was decided to reduce the original six departments and one office, thirty-six people, to seven people, and to recruit four outstanding workers, forming a new office with fresh blood and vigorous vitality. When the workers summarized their experience of streamlining the system through revolutionary criticism, they said: "This time the criticism is thorough, the reform is good! In the past, there were many people, and we could not see the people in the old system; now, although there are fewer people, we can still see the people in the new system in the workshop. Comparing the new system with the old system, one roots in the masses, and the other sets up 'home' in the office. Revolutionary criticism has turned the old system upside down, great!"

The broad revolutionary masses of this mill realized from the practice of closely combining revolutionary criticism with establishment and reform: every step forward in the struggle, criticism, and transformation, every victory in the struggle, cannot do without revolutionary criticism under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. Without revolutionary criticism, what is established has no root, what is reformed has no standard, and the direction is unclear. In revolutionary criticism, establish and reform, Chairman Mao's revolutionary line can occupy all positions.

In combination with the actual situation of workshops and teams, carry out revolutionary criticism thoroughly and persistently

The revolutionary criticism of this mill once mainly took the form of large-scale meetings and concentrated bombardment, gradually deviating from the actual class struggle of the unit, "reading reports to find materials, speeches not leaving the script, a few people busy, most people idle, firing blanks, and not eliminating poison." Some workers reflected: "Criticism with culture, illiterates watch from the side," and did not truly form a mass movement of revolutionary criticism. The revolutionary committee of the mill timely analyzed and studied the new situations and problems encountered in revolutionary criticism, learned from Chairman Mao's teachings on "the movement is developing, and there are new things ahead, new things are endless. Studying the overall development of this movement and its development is a major topic that we must pay attention to at all times," and unanimously believed that the task before us is to closely combine the practice of mass struggle, flexibly and actively carry out revolutionary criticism, fully mobilize the positive factors among the masses, and turn class struggle and the struggle between the two lines into something that workers can see and touch. They conducted in-depth investigations and research, discovered that the second workshop, with the team as the starting point, combined with the actual class struggle of the unit, started from the major issues of the struggle between the two lines, and the young and old workers fought side by side to carry out revolutionary criticism, which was very good. They quickly promoted the experience of the second workshop to the entire mill. Practice has proven that carrying out revolutionary criticism in workshops and teams is most suitable for the characteristics of industrial and mining enterprises. After revolutionary criticism developed to workshops and teams, the study classes also developed from the mill to the workshops and teams, further exposing the cover of class struggle within the mill, promoting the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit, and fully demonstrating the power of revolutionary criticism in workshops and teams. The workers dragged the class enemies to the workshops and teams for on-the-spot struggle and criticism, with everyone participating in the battle, criticizing the class enemies to the point of being disheveled and admitting their crimes.

The revolutionary workers of the second workshop brought the new products created under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought during the Cultural Revolution to the study class and opened the criticism of the traitor Liu Shaoqi's theory of "workers being backward and ignorant" with real objects. Last year, the state had an urgent task to trial-produce a batch of "drum gaskets." "Drum gaskets" are a kind of product with high requirements and quality, and revisionism used this to strangle us. The revolutionary workers of this workshop, upon hearing this, firmly requested to undertake this arduous task. However, the reactionary "technical authority" looked at the machine and shook his head, saying: "These broken-down machines want to produce this kind of paper? Impossible, absolutely impossible!"

However, the workers firmly said: Chairman Mao said we workers can do it; Chairman Mao supports us, we must make Chairman Mao proud, we must show the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries and the reactionary "technical authority" what we are made of! Several old workers voluntarily formed a trial-production team, after dozens of trials, the new product was finally successfully produced, and the quality far exceeded the imported products. This ironclad fact exposed the paper tiger's true colors of the reactionary "technical authority" and pronounced the death sentence on the "theory of workers being backward and ignorant" spread by Liu Shaoqi. The workers said at the criticism meeting, "We have grasped the technical leadership, not for fame, not for profit, but for socialism. What are the foreign 'experts' and technical 'authorities'? Without them, the earth still turns, and revolutionary production still develops. With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, we can create miracles."

The command post is set on the "front line," act as fighters, and take the lead in carrying out revolutionary criticism

The leading cadre standing on the front line of class struggle and taking the lead in carrying out revolutionary criticism is the key to making revolutionary criticism thorough and sustained, and it is also the fundamental way for the leading cadre to build a revolutionary organization. The busier the work, the more it is necessary to go deep among the masses; the more intense the struggle, the more it is necessary to go down to the grassroots; the deeper the revolutionary criticism, the more the leadership should take the lead. For a period of time, the entire mill's struggle against the enemy entered a high tide, and several standing committee members of the mill revolutionary committee were busy all day, more on the upper level and less among the masses; more arranging for the masses to criticize and less criticizing themselves; more as "observers" and less as fighters, and some committee members even developed bureaucratic tendencies. Revolutionary workers saw this and came to the door to give the revolutionary committee suggestions. The stationed military propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought found this problem and decided to help the revolutionary committee rectify it openly. During the open rectification, an old worker criticized, "In the past, you were at the forefront of the charge, fighting side by side with everyone, leading the masses forward, these we saw with our own eyes and were pleased in our hearts. But now, the battle against the enemy is so intense, we can't find you on the front line, you have laid down the front-line position of defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, taken off your work clothes, and entered the office. How can this go on?" The workers' frank and sharp criticism deeply educated the members of the revolutionary committee. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "we must not have a moment of separation from the masses," thoroughly criticized Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line of "high above" and "acting as officials and lords," deeply dug out the root of the problem, and immediately restored the system of taking turns on duty. Except for leaving one standing committee member to handle daily work, all other members went down to the workshops and teams, fighting side by side with the broad masses, and together carrying out revolutionary criticism.

　　把革命大批判贯穿于斗批改的全部过程中
    沈阳市人民造纸厂革委会带领广大革命职工，从本单位的阶级斗争实际出发，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义黑货。工人群众的两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高，有力地推动了斗批改
    沈阳市人民造纸厂革命委员会，高举革命的批判大旗，充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，从本单位的阶级斗争实际出发，深入持久地开展革命大批判，大大提高了广大工人的两条路线斗争觉悟，全厂掀起了斗、批、改的新高潮。工人群众说得好：“毛泽东思想指引下的革命大批判，是落实毛主席一系列最新指示的强大动力，是无产阶级文化大革命的战斗武器，是大立毛泽东思想的重要一环。”
    在斗批改中突出革命大批判
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。”人民造纸厂的广大革命职工通过斗争实践，深刻地认识到，全部斗、批、改的过程就是大破资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想，大破修正主义路线，大立毛主席的革命路线的过程。突出革命大批判，是搞好斗、批、改的关键。
    这个厂革委会成立后，决定对原来的一套人浮于事、重叠臃肿的旧机构进行改革。但是，有的同志没有从思想上同旧机构一刀两断，研究来研究去总是在具体问题上兜圈子。针对这种情况，驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队和革委会成员在一起反复学习了毛主席“精兵简政”和“破字当头，立也就在其中了”的教导，深刻地认识到，不彻底批臭叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇在政权建设上和企业管理上的修正主义路线，就不能打破重叠的行政机构，搞好精兵简政。不破就立，立不起来；不批就改，就得滑到邪路上去。革委会立即举办了以“精兵简政”为内容的革命大批判学习班，发动全厂革命工人，高举“鞍钢宪法”的伟大旗帜，对中国赫鲁晓夫刘少奇用旧机构反对毛主席革命路线，迫害工人群众，破坏革命事业的滔天罪行进行群众性大批判。工人们说：“旧机构是复辟资本主义的温床，是刘少奇压在工人头上的大山，不革它的命，我们就要受二遍苦，必须把它砸个稀巴烂！”革命工人的批判，一针见血地指出了旧机构的危害，使革委会受到了深刻的教育，进一步认识到精兵简政的伟大意义，大家纷纷表示：坚决走“鞍钢宪法”指引的道路，对旧的机构要坚决地改，彻底地改。通过革命大批判，原来认为没法解决的问题都一一得到了解决。破得彻底，改革就有方向。经过群众反复充分酝酿讨论，很快就提出了既有益于建立一个革命化联系群众的新机构，又符合本单位实际需要的改革方案，决定把原来六股一室，三十六人的旧机构减到七人，又吸收了四名优秀工人，组成了充满新鲜血液，朝气蓬勃的新的办事机构。工人们在总结通过革命大批判精简机构的体会时说：“这回批得透，改得好！过去人多，我们看不到旧机构的人；现在人虽少，我们在车间里还能经常看得到新机构的人。新机构和旧机构比，一个把根扎在群众中，一个把‘家’安到办公室里，是革命大批判把旧机构翻了个个儿，太好了！”
    这个厂广大革命职工从把革命大批判和大立大改紧密结合起来的实践中体会到：斗、批、改每向前推进一步，斗争每取得一个胜利，都离不开毛泽东思想指引下的革命大批判，离开了革命大批判，立的就没有根，改的就没有准，方向就不明确。在革命大批判中大立大改，毛主席的革命路线才能占领一切阵地。
    结合车间班组的实际，深入持久搞好革命大批判
    这个厂的革命大批判曾一度以大会批、集中轰为主要形式，这样逐渐脱离了本单位阶级斗争实际，“看报找材料，发言不离稿，少数人空忙，多数人闲着，空炮放的多，流毒肃不掉。”有的工人反映：“有文化的批判，不识字的旁边看”，没有真正形成革命大批判的群众运动。厂革委会对革命大批判遇到的新情况新问题，作了及时的分析研究，学习了毛主席关于“运动在发展中，又有新的东西在前头，新东西是层出不穷的。研究这个运动的全面及其发展，是我们要时刻注意的大课题”的教导，一致认为，摆在我们面前的课题是，必须紧密结合群众斗争的实践，机动灵活地开展革命大批判，把群众中的积极因素充分调动起来，把阶级斗争和两条路线斗争变成工人看得见摸得着的东西。他们深入实际调查研究，发现二车间以班组为基点，结合本单位的阶级斗争实际，从两条路线斗争的大是大非出发，青年工人和老工人协同作战，开展革命大批判的做法很好，就很快把二车间的经验推广到全厂。事实证明，车间班组开展革命大批判最适应工矿企业的特点。革命大批判发展到车间班组后，学习班也由厂办发展到车间班组办，进一步揭开了厂内阶级斗争盖子，推动了本单位的斗、批、改，充分显示了车间班组革命大批判的威力。工人们把阶级敌人揪到车间班组，火线批斗，人人参战，批得阶级敌人狼狈不堪，低头认罪。
    二车间革命职工把在文化大革命中高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗创造出来的新产品拿到学习班里，用实物展开了对叛徒刘少奇的“工人落后无知”论的批判。去年，国家有一批试制生产“缸垫纸”的紧急任务。“缸垫纸”是一种要求很严、质量很高的产品，修正主义用这个卡我们的脖子。这个车间革命职工听到这种情况，坚决要求承担这项艰巨任务。可是反动技术“权威”看了机器后，摇晃着脑袋说：“这些破烂不堪的土机器想生产这种纸？不行，根本不行！”
    可是工人们坚定地说：毛主席说我们工人阶级行；毛主席为我们撑腰，我们要为毛主席争气，非给帝、修、反和反动技术“权威”点颜色瞧瞧不可！几个老工人自动组成了一个试制小组，经过几十次的试验，新产品终于试制成功了，质量大大超过了进口产品。这一铁的事实，戳穿了反动技术“权威”纸老虎原形，宣判了刘少奇所散布的“工人落后无知论”的死刑。工人们在批判会上说，“我们掌握了技术领导权，不为名，不为利，为的是社会主义。什么洋牌的‘专家’、技术‘权威’，没有他们地球照样转动，革命生产照样发展。有战无不胜的毛泽东思想，我们就能创造出奇迹。”
    指挥部设在“火线”上，当好战斗员，带头搞好革命大批判
    领导班子站在阶级斗争的第一线，带头开展革命大批判，是使革命大批判深入持久的关键，也是领导班子革命化建设的根本途径。工作越忙越要深入群众，斗争越激烈越要下到基层，革命大批判越深入领导越要带头。有一段时间，全厂对敌斗争进入高潮，厂革委会的几名常委一天忙得脚不离地，在上面多了，深入群众少了；布置群众批判多了，自己批判少了；当“观察员”时候多了，当战斗员少了，有的委员还滋长了官僚主义作风。革命工人看到这些，就找上门来给革委会提意见。驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队同志发现了这个问题，决定帮助革委会开门整风。在开门整风中，有的老工人批评说：“你们前一段冲锋在前打头阵，和大家一道并肩战斗，带领群众前进，这些咱们是看在眼里，喜在心上。可是，现在对敌斗争仗打得这样激烈，第一线上找不到你们了，放下了捍卫毛主席革命路线的前沿阵地，脱下了工作服，走进了办公室，照这样下去怎么行？”工人群众中肯尖锐的批评，使革委会的同志受到了很大教育。他们反复学习了毛主席“我们不要有一时一刻脱离群众”的教导，狠批了刘少奇“高高在上”“做官当老爷”的反革命修正主义路线，深挖了思想根子，立即恢复了轮流值班制度，除留一名常委坚持日常工作外，其他成员全部下到车间班组，和广大群众并肩战斗，一起搞革命大批判。
