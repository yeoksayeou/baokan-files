I am filled with immense joy and excitement as I repeatedly study the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. Reflecting on the two years of struggle, we are filled with the joy of victory and the spirit of battle, ready to accept the new battle tasks proposed by the communiqué.

The communiqué solemnly declares: "Shaoqi Liu is to be permanently expelled from the Party, and all his positions within and outside the Party are to be revoked, and the treasonous crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices are to be continued to be settled." What a heartening resolution this is! Under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, we have been engaged in fierce struggles with the traitor Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the Inner Mongolia region for more than two years. Today, the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee has politically sentenced the traitor Liu Shaoqi to death, ensuring that he will never be able to turn over a new leaf. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, and a great victory for the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

The Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee is a mobilization meeting for the complete victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. The communiqué is our battle program. We must seriously study the communiqué, enthusiastically propagate the communiqué, and resolutely implement the communiqué. We must defend the spirit of the communiqué to the death, continue to deeply develop the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and fully implement, item by item, Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. We must launch a magnificent wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

To complete the various battle tasks proposed in the communiqué, we must grasp class struggle firmly and not relax. We must tighten our grip on class struggle and tighten it further. As the communiqué points out: "In the more than two years of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, the history is permeated with the fierce struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads." The class enemies will not accept their defeat and will undoubtedly use every means to launch a desperate counterattack. This counterattack is mainly manifested in the enemies' attempts to reverse the verdict and sabotage the Cultural Revolution. Faced with the class enemies' counterattack, we must not be lenient and must resolutely strike back, taking the initiative to launch an offensive.

Since the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region last November, we have followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasped class struggle, and mobilized the masses throughout the region. We have combined the cleansing of class ranks with revolutionary criticism and launched a fierce attack on the class enemies. In this year of struggle, we have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, continuously armed ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and finally overcome all the class enemies' desperate resistance. We have unearthed a batch of hidden traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, rightists, and national separatists. Through revolutionary criticism, we have further purged the reactionary revisionist ideology promoted by Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Inner Mongolia. In this class struggle, we have promoted revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, forming a powerful proletarian revolutionary force, and vigorously promoting work in all aspects. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has achieved decisive victory.

We must follow the direction indicated by the communiqué, further grasp class struggle, and seriously carry out the work of cleansing class ranks and revolutionary criticism. We must firmly grasp the line of struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, and promote all other work. We must unconditionally complete the great historical mission entrusted to us by Chairman Mao to "seriously carry out struggle, criticism, and transformation" and achieve a complete victory in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

    狠抓阶级斗争不转向
    内蒙古自治区革委会副主任、工人　霍道余
    我怀着无比幸福、无比兴奋的激情，一遍又一遍地学习了党的八届十二中全会公报。回顾两年来战斗的历程，我们充满着胜利的喜悦，满怀着战斗的豪情，迎接公报提出的新的战斗任务。
    公报庄严宣布：“把刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外的一切职务，并继续清算刘少奇及其同伙叛党叛国的罪行。”这是多么大快人心的决议啊！在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指引下，我们与叛徒刘少奇及其在内蒙古地区的代理人激烈搏斗了两年多，今天，党的八届十二中全会从政治上判处了叛徒刘少奇的死刑，使他永世不得翻身，这是毛泽东思想的一个伟大胜利，这是无产阶级文化大革命的一个伟大胜利。
    八届十二中全会是一次夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的动员会议，公报是我们的战斗纲领，我们一定要以认真学习公报，热情宣传公报，坚决执行公报，誓死捍卫公报的精神，继续深入开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，全面落实、条条落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，掀起波澜壮阔的斗、批、改新高潮。
    要完成公报中提出的各项战斗任务，必须狠抓阶级斗争不转向。要把阶级斗争抓紧，再抓紧。正如公报所指出的：“两年多来无产阶级文化大革命的历史，贯串着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的剧烈斗争。”阶级敌人决不甘心于他们的失败，必然会千方百计地进行疯狂反扑。这种反扑，集中表现为敌人的翻案活动和对文化大革命的破坏。面对阶级敌人的反扑，我们决不能手软，要坚决给予痛击，主动地打进攻战。
    从去年十一月内蒙古自治区革命委员会成立以后，我们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓阶级斗争，在全区范围内放手发动群众，把清理阶级队伍和革命大批判紧密结合起来，向阶级敌人猛烈地进攻。在这一年的搏斗中，我们活学活用毛主席著作，不断用毛泽东思想武装自己，终于战胜了一切阶级敌人的负隅顽抗，挖出了一批隐藏的叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派，地富反坏右分子，民族分裂主义分子。通过革命大批判，进一步肃清了刘少奇及其在内蒙古的代理人推行的反革命修正主义思想。在这场阶级斗争中，促进了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，形成了一支富有战斗力的无产阶级革命队伍，有力地推动了各方面的工作。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线取得了决定性的胜利。
    我们一定要按照公报指引的航向，进一步抓好阶级斗争，认真搞好清理阶级队伍工作和革命大批判，狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争这条纲，推动其他各项工作，不折不扣地完成毛主席交给我们的“认真搞好斗、批、改”的伟大历史使命，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
