The workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and the broad revolutionary masses of Shaanxi Province, with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, are carrying forward the revolutionary academic style of combining theory with practice as advocated by Chairman Mao. They are earnestly studying and enthusiastically propagating the public report of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, resolutely implementing all the great battle tasks proposed by the Plenum, and have swiftly launched a new high tide of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and earnestly carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. The revolution and production are presenting a thriving new scene.

After the public report of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was issued, workers and poor peasants in various parts of Shaanxi immediately organized tens of thousands of Mao Zedong Thought study classes with factory work teams and rural people's communes production teams as units, focusing on studying the report. Many workers and poor peasants said during the study of the report that the Plenum report shines with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought and is a beacon guiding the people of the whole country from victory to victory. We must carry forward the revolutionary academic style of combining theory with practice as advocated by Chairman Mao. We must not only study well and understand deeply but also implement resolutely and act swiftly. We must strive hard in implementation. In the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an, revolutionary workers and poor peasants who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao have launched a hot tide of "study the report and take action." They not only lead in studying and implementing but also organize large teams of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to go to the mountains and countryside, deeply into the grassroots and among the masses, to propagate the report. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Yangjialing, where Chairman Mao once resided, and the Zao Garden Production Brigade have enthusiastically responded to the call of the Plenum report, further carrying out the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works. They hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes before doing anything, bringing problems to study Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions and the Plenum report, arming their minds with Mao Zedong Thought and guiding their actions. They say, "Implement a thousand times, implement Mao Zedong Thought as the most fundamental implementation. A ship sailing on the sea relies on the helmsman; revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. Every step we advance on the revolutionary journey is the wise guidance of Chairman Mao, and it is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. To achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must push the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to a new high tide and let Mao Zedong Thought occupy all positions."

In the days since the public report was issued, the cities and countryside of Shaanxi are all battlefields for denouncing the traitorous, counter-revolutionary crimes of Liu Shaoqi. Liu Shaoqi, this traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader, in 1960, under the pretext of "inspection," went to the Xi'an Enamel Factory to peddle his counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods. In recent days, the revolutionary workers of the entire factory, with deep hatred for the traitor Liu Shaoqi, have continuously held meetings to criticize and denounce Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary crimes. The workers angrily pointed out that Liu Shaoqi, in 1960, came to our factory, peddling the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and the "theory of peace within the party," obscuring class struggle, and vigorously protecting unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, giving them support and encouragement. When he saw the factory's capitalist-roaders arranging for a rightist to perform so-called "technical demonstrations," he praised it highly and instructed the factory's capitalist-roaders, saying, "Rightists can also have their hats removed if they achieve results in technology." From then on, the factory's capitalist-roaders became even more unbridled in recruiting and accommodating traitors, spies, and capitalist-roaders, pulling them into the factory party committee and arranging them in offices. Half of the eleven offices in the factory were usurped by the remnants of the Kuomintang. The revolutionary workers of this factory angrily said that Liu Shaoqi and his agents' evil activities of opposing the great leader Chairman Mao, opposing Mao Zedong Thought, and opposing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line are all attempts to drag socialist New China back to the road of capitalist restoration. We must thoroughly criticize and expose Liu Shaoqi, eliminate all his poisonous influences, and turn the factory into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The broad masses of workers and poor peasants throughout the province, using the public report as a weapon, closely combine the great criticism of the revolution with struggle, criticism, and transformation, studying, criticizing, implementing, and rectifying simultaneously, achieving immediate results. The revolutionary miners of Weibei Coal Mine in Shaanxi combined studying the report, criticizing the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi with cleaning up the class ranks and reforming unreasonable regulations and systems, achieving new successes in struggle, criticism, and transformation. Recently, they exposed a small group of deeply hidden class enemies and further reformed the old habits that shackle the development of productive forces. The enthusiasm of the workers throughout the mine has increased, and production has continued to rise. The transportation area of this mine increased its daily coal transportation by six times compared to the average daily transportation in October during the days the report was issued. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Yangheba Production Brigade in Xixiang County, while studying the report, angrily exposed the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes of restoring capitalism. They said that in 1955, our great leader Chairman Mao, in the book "On the Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside," wrote a comment for the correct leadership of the mutual aid cooperation movement by the Party branch of Yangheba Township (now Yangheba Production Brigade). We followed Chairman Mao's words and took the road of cooperation and communalization. However, a small group of capitalist-roaders repeatedly came to our brigade to peddle Liu Shaoqi's "three freedoms and one contract" black goods, breaking up production from the brigade to the work team and from the work team to the household, three contracts and two contracts, destroying the collective economy. Our brigade's grain yield per mu decreased from 500 jin at the time of Chairman Mao's comment to over 200 jin. This is the evidence that Liu Shaoqi, this traitor, implemented the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, wanting us to suffer twice. We must follow the course set by Chairman Mao and resolutely take the socialist road. Recently, the poor and lower-middle peasants of this brigade have learned from Dazhai Brigade, establishing a complete set of management systems that highlight proletarian politics. At the same time, combined with the great criticism, they launched a fierce attack on a small group of class enemies, exposing a landlord who had not been reformed and was destroying the collective economy. The revolution and production of the entire brigade are booming.

Currently, the workers and poor peasants of Shaanxi Province are studying the report while summarizing experiences, determined to further launch a new high tide of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, comprehensively implementing all the battle tasks proposed by the Plenum, and carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

　　陕西广大工人、贫下中农在党的八届十二中全会公报的鼓舞下
　　掀起活学活用毛泽东思想新高潮
    新华社西安十二日电　陕西省的工人阶级、贫下中农和广大革命群众，怀着无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，发扬毛主席亲自倡导的“理论和实践相结合”的革命学风，认真学习、热情宣传党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报，坚决落实全会提出的各项伟大战斗任务，迅速掀起了活学活用毛泽东思想和认真搞好斗、批、改的新高潮，革命和生产出现一派欣欣向荣的新景象。
    党的八届十二中全会公报发表后，陕西各地的工人和贫下中农，立即以工厂班组、农村人民公社生产队为单位，办起数以万计的以学习公报为主要内容的毛泽东思想学习班。许多工人和贫下中农在学习公报时说，全会公报闪耀着毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉，是引导全国人民从胜利走向胜利的指路明灯。我们一定要发扬毛主席一贯倡导的“理论和实践相结合”的革命学风，不仅要学得好，领会得深，而且要执行得坚决，行动得迅速，要在落实上狠下功夫。在革命圣地延安，无限忠于毛主席的革命工人和贫下中农，掀起了一个“学公报，见行动”的热潮。他们不仅自己带头学，带头执行，还组成大批毛泽东思想宣传队，上山下乡，深入基层，深入群众，宣传公报。毛主席的旧居杨家岭和枣园大队的贫下中农，热烈响应全会公报的号召，进一步开展学习毛主席著作的群众运动，他们无论干什么，都要先开办毛泽东思想学习班，带着问题学习毛主席的一系列最新指示和全会公报，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，指导行动。他们说，千落实万落实，落实毛泽东思想是最根本的落实。大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。我们在革命的征途上每前进一步，都是毛主席的英明指引，都是毛泽东思想的胜利。我们要夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，就要把活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动推向一个新高潮，让毛泽东思想占领一切阵地。
    在全会公报发表的这些日子里，陕西城乡到处都是声讨刘少奇叛党叛国反革命罪行的战场。刘少奇这个叛徒、内奸、工贼，一九六○年曾以“视察”为名到西安人民搪瓷厂大肆推销其反革命修正主义黑货。连日来，全厂革命职工怀着对叛徒刘少奇的深仇大恨，不断举行集会，批判和声讨刘少奇的反革命罪行。工人们愤怒指出，刘少奇一九六○年到我们厂来，大肆兜售“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“党内和平论”，抹杀阶级斗争，竭力保护没有改造好的地富反坏右分子，为他们撑腰打气。当他看到厂内走资派安排一个右派分子摆弄所谓“技术表演”后，就赞不绝口，并指示厂内的走资派说：“右派分子在技术上搞出成绩，也可以摘帽子。”从此，厂内的走资派更加肆无忌惮地招降纳叛，结党营私，把一小撮叛徒、特务、工贼拉进厂党委和安排在科室内，全厂十一个科室有一半多被国民党的残渣余孽篡夺了领导权。这个厂的革命工人愤怒地说，刘少奇及其代理人这些反对伟大领袖毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，反对毛主席的革命路线的罪恶活动，就是妄图把社会主义新中国拉到资本主义复辟的道路上。我们一定要把刘少奇批倒批臭，肃清他的一切流毒，把工厂办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    全省广大工人和贫下中农，以全会公报为武器，把革命大批判同斗、批、改紧密结合起来，边学习、边开展革命大批判、边落实、边整改，收到了立竿见影的效果。陕西渭北煤矿的革命矿工，把学习公报，批判叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇同清理阶级队伍工作结合起来，同改革不合理的规章制度结合起来，使斗、批、改取得了新的成就。最近，他们挖出了一小撮隐藏很深的阶级敌人，同时进一步改革了束缚生产力发展的陈规旧习。全矿广大工人干劲倍增，产量不断上升。这个矿区的选运区在公报发表的这些日子里，每天的运煤量比十月份的平均每天的运煤量增长六倍。西乡县杨河坝大队的贫下中农在学习公报时，愤怒地控诉了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。他们说，一九五五年，我们伟大领袖毛主席在《中国农村的社会主义高潮》一书中，为杨河坝乡（现为杨河坝大队）党支部正确领导互助合作运动写过按语。我们听毛主席的话，走上了合作化、公社化的大道。可是，一小撮走资派却三番五次地来我们大队贩卖刘少奇“三自一包”的黑货，把生产从队包到作业组，从作业组又包到户，三包两包，破坏了集体经济，我们队粮食的亩产量由毛主席批示时的五百斤下降到二百多斤。这都是刘少奇这个叛徒推行反革命修正主义路线，要我们重受二遍苦的罪证。我们一定要按毛主席指引的航向大步前进，坚决走社会主义道路。最近这个大队的贫下中农向大寨大队学习，建立了一整套突出无产阶级政治的管理制度。同时，结合大批判，向一小撮阶级敌人展开猛烈进攻，揪出了一个破坏集体经济的没有改造好的地主分子。全大队的革命和生产搞得轰轰烈烈。
    当前，陕西省的工人阶级和贫下中农，正在一边学习公报，一边总结经验，决心进一步掀起活学活用毛泽东思想的新高潮，全面落实全会提出的各项战斗任务，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
