In the midst of the triumphant songs of the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the first chemical fiber textile factory in our country using hemp as raw material—the Zhangjiakou July 1st Chemical Fiber Textile Factory—has been completed at high speed and recently successfully started production.

This factory, using hemp stalks from the Zhangjiakou region as raw material, is a modernized medium-sized integrated enterprise with an annual spinning capacity of 900 tons and a weaving capacity of 6 million meters of fabric. Construction began on July 1st of this year, and in less than three months, the main factory buildings for the pulp, spinning, spinning, and weaving workshops were completed. Additionally, 360 sets of mechanical equipment were installed through self-reliance.

The entire construction process was a fierce struggle between two lines. Workers on the construction site and in the dormitories extensively held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, severely criticizing the "slave philosophy" and "creeping policy" of the number one capitalist roader within the Party, Liu Shaoqi, and exposing a handful of reactionary bourgeois technical "authorities." Before construction began, some technicians with conservative ideas said, "Just drawing the construction drawings will take three months, and even the fastest spinning will take three years!" However, the comrades from the construction site command center, with workers as the main force, studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "the masses are the real heroes," with unwavering confidence, and based on the opinions of the worker masses, boldly and decisively adopted the construction method of designing, procuring materials, constructing, installing, and testing production all at the same time, completing the construction in less than three months.

The machinery and equipment needed for this textile factory included some new projects with large models and high precision, which local factories had never manufactured before. Workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought launched a mass movement and carried out communist cooperation. With the support of revolutionary old workers from places like Shanghai, they overcame numerous difficulties with an unyielding heroic spirit. In just over forty days, they manufactured large, precise, and complete sets of equipment, including five-spindle machines and spinning machines. The Zhangjiakou Internal Combustion Engine Factory, with only 100 people and simple equipment, undertook the task of manufacturing large equipment—the drying machine. The iron conveyor belt on the machine had over 870,000 small holes, but they made do with what they had and worked meticulously, meeting all specifications. The machines of the July 1st Chemical Fiber Textile Factory were thus manufactured at an unprecedented speed through collective wisdom and effort.

### 张家口七一化学纤维纺织厂建成投产

    张家口七一化学纤维纺织厂建成投产
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，我国第一座胡麻纤维纺织厂——张家口市七一化学纤维纺织厂以高速度建成，最近胜利喷丝投产。
    这座工厂，是以张家口地区特产的胡麻秸为原料，年喷丝九百吨、织布六百万米的一座现代化中型联合企业。今年七月一日动工兴建，不到三个月时间就完成了浆沤、喷丝、纺纱、织布等车间的主体厂房建筑，并且自力更生地安装了机械设备三百六十多台（件）。
    整个建厂过程是一场两条路线的激烈斗争。工人们在施工现场、工棚内外，普遍举办了毛泽东思想学习班，狠批了党内头号走资派刘少奇的“洋奴哲学”、“爬行主义”，斗臭了一小撮反动的资产阶级技术“权威”。开工前，存有保守思想的个别技术人员说：“光绘制土建施工图纸就需三个月，要喷丝最快也得三年！”但是，以工人为主体的工地指挥部的同志们，学习了毛主席关于“群众是真正的英雄”的教导，信心百倍，根据工人群众的意见，大胆果断地采取边设计、边备料、边施工、边安装、边试车投产的建厂方法，不到三个月就建成了。
    这座纺织厂需要的机器设备，有的项目新，型号大，精密度高，当地工厂过去没有制造过。用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人们就大搞群众运动，开展共产主义大协作，在上海等地革命老工人的支援下，以无高不可攀的英雄气概，克服了重重困难，在短短的四十多天中，就把包括五合机、喷丝机等大型精密成套设备制造出来了。张家口市内燃机厂仅有一百人，设备简陋，他们承担了制造大型设备——烘燥机的任务，机器上的铁制传送带上有八十七万多个小眼，他们因陋就简，一丝不苟，做得完全合乎规格。七一化学纤维纺织厂的一台台机器，就是这样以前所未有的高速度群策群力地制造出来的。
