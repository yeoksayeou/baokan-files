Calcutta, India's largest city, saw approximately one thousand students and citizens stage an anti-U.S. protest on the 20th, vehemently opposing the visit of former U.S. Secretary of Defense and World Bank President Robert McNamara to the city.

According to reports, the reactionary authorities in Calcutta were terrified of the people's just actions and dared not announce McNamara's visit to the city in advance. When McNamara arrived in Calcutta, the reactionary authorities secretly used a helicopter to transport him from the airport to the Governor's residence in the city center. At this time, protesters gathered near the airport waved black flags and angrily shouted slogans such as "McNamara go back," "Butcher McNamara get out," firmly protesting against this butcher, whose hands are stained with the blood of the Vietnamese people, entering the city. The reactionary authorities in Calcutta immediately dispatched police to brutally suppress the protesters. However, the protesters, undaunted by the violence, bravely retaliated with stones and bricks against the police's savage suppression.

In the city center of Calcutta, protesters angrily set fire to three trams and erected barricades on the streets, persistently fighting against the reactionary police sent to suppress them for three hours.

According to reports, on the same day, protests against imperialism were held throughout West Bengal, opposing McNamara's activities in India.

    据报道，加尔各答反动当局对人民的正义行动怕得要命，不敢预先宣布麦克纳马拉要到加尔各答进行活动一事，当麦克纳马拉到达加尔各答时，反动当局偷偷地用直升飞机把麦克纳马拉从机场护送到市中心的邦长府。这时，聚集在机场附近的示威者挥舞黑旗，愤怒高呼“麦克纳马拉滚回去”、“刽子手麦克纳马拉”等口号，坚决抗议这个双手沾满越南人民鲜血的刽子手进入这个城市。加尔各答反动当局立即派警察进行残暴镇压。但是示威者不畏强暴，勇敢地用石头和砖头回击警察的野蛮镇压。
    在加尔各答市中心，示威者愤怒地烧毁了三辆电车，并且在街上垒起路障，坚持同前往镇压的反动警察斗争达三小时之久。
    据报道，在同一天，西孟加拉邦全邦各地举行“反帝日”示威，抗议麦克纳马拉到印度活动。
