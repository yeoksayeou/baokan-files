The communiqué of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Party has been issued. This joyous news reached the Tianhua Production Brigade of Guangfu People's Commune in Changsha County, Hunan, where the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi had personally implemented the revisionist line. The brigade immediately erupted with excitement. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants were extremely elated and spread the news to each other: "The communiqué of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee has been issued. The plenary session unanimously decided to expel Liu Shaoqi, this big bad guy, from the Party forever and to revoke all his Party and state positions. This is truly wonderful!"

A fifty-something-year-old poor peasant, Peng Haifan, upon hearing this news, repeatedly exclaimed, "Chairman Mao is truly wise and great!" Another poor peasant, Fan Shusheng, was extremely excited and said, "Good! Good! Our wish has been fulfilled! Exposing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary face and expelling him from the Party is a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line! We must shout a thousand and ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!"

The Tianhua Production Brigade is a red banner on the agricultural front in Hunan Province. The poor and lower-middle peasants here have resolutely followed Chairman Mao's words and walked the socialist path since liberation. By 1960, grain production had nearly doubled compared to the early days of liberation. In 1961, when our country faced severe natural disasters and domestic and foreign class enemies launched fierce attacks, the traitor Liu Shaoqi sneaked into this area, using the guise of "working in the countryside" to suppress and persecute the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, and to push for a capitalist restoration. He stayed here for 18 days and personally promoted a series of counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods such as "production responsibility system," "individual management of forests," "expansion of private plots," "decentralization of collective sideline production," "abolition of basic rations," and "opening of free markets." This caused the collective economy of the Tianhua Production Brigade to suffer severe losses and production to plummet. Liu Shaoqi, this big bad guy, labeled a group of good cadres who insisted on the socialist path as an "anti-Party clique" and subjected them to brutal political persecution. When the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants rejoiced over the issuance of the communiqué of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee, they recalled all this and were filled with indignation. The original women's director of the brigade, now a member of the Changsha Municipal Revolutionary Committee, Tong Yuebin, and the brother of the original brigade party branch secretary, Peng Meixiu, Peng Kunhuang, who had suffered persecution from Liu Shaoqi, denounced: Peng Meixiu, who was of poor peasant origin and had always insisted on the socialist path, was cruelly persecuted by Liu Shaoqi to death. It was under the leadership of our great savior Chairman Mao in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that we, the poor and lower-middle peasants who had suffered persecution, were able to stand up and be liberated, and Peng Meixiu was able to be completely exonerated. Now, the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee has unanimously passed a resolution to expel Liu Shaoqi, this big bad guy, from the Party forever. Our long-awaited wish has finally been fulfilled. We will forever follow Chairman Mao's words, closely follow Chairman Mao in revolution, and give Liu Shaoqi, this fallen dog, a thorough beating, so that he will never be able to rise again!

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the poor and lower-middle peasants of the Tianhua Production Brigade, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly exposed Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes of attempting to restore capitalism in the Tianhua Production Brigade, bringing about earth-shaking changes. Under the brilliant light of the great Mao Zedong Thought, in 1967, the grain production of the entire brigade increased by 220,000 jin compared to 1966, creating a record high. This year, grain production increased by another 80,000 jin or so compared to last year, exceeding the state procurement quota. Seeing these changes, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants were overjoyed. They said with great excitement that they would strive to complete all the combat tasks proposed by the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao as the leader and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy, and achieve even greater victories in revolution and production.

    “我们的心愿实现了！”
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表了。这一喜讯传到叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇亲自推行过修正主义路线的湖南长沙县广福公社天华大队时，这个大队立即沸腾起来了。广大贫下中农兴奋异常，奔走相告：“党的八届十二中全会公报发表了。全会一致决定把刘少奇这个大坏蛋永远开除出党，并且撤消其党内外的一切职务。这真是好极了！”五十多岁的老贫农彭海凡听了这个喜讯，连声说：“毛主席真英明，真伟大！”老贫农范树生无比激动地说：“好！好！我们的心愿实现了！把刘少奇的反革命面貌揭露出来，并把他清除出党，这是无产阶级文化大革命的一个伟大胜利，是毛主席革命路线的一个伟大胜利！我们要千遍万遍地高呼：毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    天华大队是湖南省农业战线上的一面红旗。这里的贫下中农解放后坚决听毛主席的话，走社会主义道路，到一九六○年，粮食产量比解放初期增长将近一倍。一九六一年，正当我国遭遇严重的自然灾害，国内外阶级敌人猖狂向我进攻的时候，刘少奇这个大叛徒窜到这里，打着“蹲点”的旗号，在这里压制、迫害贫下中农和革命干部，大搞资本主义复辟。他在这里“蹲点”十八天，亲自抛出什么“产量责任制”、“山林分户管理”、“扩大自留地”、集体副业“下放到户”、“取消基本口粮”、开放“自由市场”等一大堆反革命修正主义黑货，使天华大队的集体经济遭受严重损失，生产大幅度下降。刘少奇这个大坏蛋把一大批坚持走社会主义道路的好干部打成“反党集团”，对他们进行残酷的政治迫害。广大贫下中农在欢呼党的八届十二中全会公报发表的时候，回想起这一切，无不气愤填膺。曾经遭受刘少奇迫害的原大队妇女主任、现长沙市革委会委员童岳斌和原大队党总支书记彭梅秀的哥哥彭昆晃控诉说：贫农出身、一直坚持走社会主义道路的彭梅秀就是遭受刘少奇的残酷迫害致死的。在我们的大救星毛主席亲自发动和亲自领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们这些受迫害的贫下中农才得到了翻身解放，彭梅秀才得到了彻底平反。现在，党的八届十二中全会一致通过决议，把刘少奇这个大坏蛋永远开除出党，我们盼望已久的愿望终于实现了。我们要永远听毛主席的话，紧跟毛主席干革命，痛打刘少奇这条落水狗，叫他永世不得翻身！
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，天华大队的贫下中农，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，彻底清算了刘少奇在天华大队妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行，使天华大队发生了翻天覆地的变化。在伟大的毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉照耀下，一九六七年全大队粮食产量比一九六六年增加二十二万斤，创造了历史上的最高水平。今年粮食产量又比去年增加八万斤左右，超额完成了国家征购任务。广大贫下中农看到这些变化，笑在眉头喜在心。他们无比兴奋地说，我们决心在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下，为完成党的八届十二中全会所提出的各项战斗任务而奋斗，在革命和生产上夺取更大的胜利。
