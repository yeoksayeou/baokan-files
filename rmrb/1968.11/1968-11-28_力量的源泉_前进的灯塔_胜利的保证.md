At the moment when the entire nation, both military and civilian, is inspired by the spirit of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee and striding forward to seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenum of the Seventh Central Committee, this brilliant Marxist-Leninist document of epoch-making significance, has been reissued. The important editorial "Seriously Study the History of the Struggle Between the Two Lines" published by the central newspapers and journal conveys Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "Historical experience is worth noting. One line, one viewpoint, must be repeatedly emphasized. It is not enough to tell a few people; it must be made known to the broad revolutionary masses." Chairman Mao's extremely important instructions have pointed out the direction for us to deeply engage in the struggle between the two lines.

The struggle between the lines within the Party is a reflection of the class struggle in society. In Qinghai, over the nineteen years since liberation, there has always been a fierce struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines. In the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, this struggle has been particularly intense. It is the decisive battle of the long-term struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the counter-revolutionary revisionist line represented by Liu Shaoqi. In this struggle, the working class of Qinghai has followed Chairman Mao's great teachings, under the battle cry of "Bombard the Headquarters," with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, together with the August 18 Revolutionary Rebels and the broad revolutionary masses throughout the province, firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We have raised the revolutionary banner of "Rebellion against the reactionaries is justified" and launched a fierce attack on Liu Shaoqi, the most treacherous and vicious counter-revolutionary leader, and his agents in Qinghai. After a long, repeated, and arduous struggle, we finally exposed Liu Shaoqi's agents in Qinghai, removed their positions, seized their power, established a revolutionary committee with a three-in-one combination, and achieved a great and decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The intense struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in Qinghai proves: Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the source of our strength, the beacon of our progress, and the guarantee of our victory. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the lifeline of the Party, the lifeline of the state, and the lifeline of the proletarian revolutionary fighters and all revolutionary comrades. No matter how strong the winds and waves, we must firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. No matter how treacherous the journey, we must bravely struggle to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This is the greatest virtue of a revolutionary and the greatest loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. The glorious history of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Qinghai is a song of praise to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, composed by the proletarian revolutionary fighters and the broad revolutionary masses of Qinghai with the word "loyalty"!

Today, the great traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi, who has been hiding within the Party, has been overthrown, and his bourgeois headquarters has been completely destroyed. His and his accomplices' heinous crimes of betraying the Party and the country are being thoroughly exposed by the hundreds of millions of revolutionary people. However, we must clearly recognize that the struggle between the two lines has not ended but is continuing in more concealed and complex forms. There is no room for compromise in the struggle between the lines. Everyone will inevitably face the severe test of the struggle between the two lines and will have to declare their stance in this test. In our revolutionary ranks, there are a few comrades who have been blinded by the smoke of firecrackers and blocked by the good news, unable to smell the class struggle and the struggle between the lines, unable to see the class enemies sharpening their knives. They think they can sleep soundly without any worries; some even cannot distinguish between friends and enemies, unknowingly doing stupid things that hurt friends and please enemies, which is very dangerous.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Different thoughts and struggles within the Party are constantly occurring. This is the reflection of class contradictions and contradictions between new and old things within society in the Party." Therefore, we must never forget the struggle between the two lines within the Party, study, implement, and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line every day; criticize, deeply criticize, and thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois reactionary line and various erroneous tendencies every day. Only in this way can we continuously raise our awareness of the struggle between the two lines, continuously raise our consciousness in implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, effectively consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, prevent capitalist restoration, and ensure that our socialist state remains unchanged for thousands of generations.

As a representative of the working class participating in the Qinghai Revolutionary Committee, I will definitely take the lead in studying and applying Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenum of the Seventh Central Committee and his series of latest instructions, further arm myself with Chairman Mao's theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, continuously raise my class struggle awareness and awareness of the struggle between the two lines, never forget Chairman Mao's great teachings of "always maintaining a humble, prudent, modest, and unarrogant style, always maintaining a hardworking style," and always be alert to the attacks of the bourgeois "sugar-coated bullets." In the struggle, continuously raise my political awareness and forever preserve the revolutionary character of the working class.

The working class of Qinghai Province will definitely closely unite around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, actively respond to the battle calls of the proletarian headquarters, fully utilize Liu Shaoqi as a negative example, continue to deeply carry out the great criticism, and in the great criticism, seriously study the history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party. The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The correct political and military lines are not naturally and peacefully produced and developed, but are produced and developed through struggle." We will definitely, in the current high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation, even higher hold up the great banner of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, further deepen the struggle between the two lines, and seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

    力量的源泉　前进的灯塔　胜利的保证
    青海省革命委员会副主任  青海省交通厅汽车七厂工人  马集文
    正当全国亿万军民在党的八届扩大的十二中全会精神鼓舞下，昂首阔步为夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的时刻，毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告这一具有划时代意义的马克思列宁主义光辉文献重新发表了，中央两报一刊为此发表的重要社论《认真学习两条路线斗争的历史》中传达了毛主席的最新指示：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”毛主席这一极为重要的指示，为我们深入地进行两条路线斗争指明了方向。
    党内的路线斗争是社会上阶级斗争的反映。在青海，解放十九年来始终存在着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争。在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，这种斗争表现得尤其激烈。这是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线和以刘少奇为代表的反革命修正主义路线长期斗争的大决战。在这场斗争中，我们青海工人阶级遵循毛主席的伟大教导，在毛主席《炮打司令部》的战斗号召下，在中国人民解放军的有力支持下，同全省八·一八革命造反派以及广大革命群众一道，坚定不移地站在毛主席无产阶级革命路线一边，高举“对反动派造反有理”的革命大旗，向刘少奇这个最阴险、最凶恶的反革命头子及其在青海的代理人展开了猛烈的进攻。经过了长期的、反复的、艰苦的斗争，终于把刘少奇在青海的代理人挖了出来，罢了他们的官，夺了他们的权，建立了三结合的革命政权——革命委员会，取得了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大的、决定性的胜利。
    青海两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线惊心动魄的斗争实践证明：毛主席的无产阶级革命路线是我们力量的源泉，前进的灯塔，胜利的保证。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线是党的生命线，是国家的生命线，是无产阶级革命派战士和一切革命同志的生命线。不管风吹浪打，坚定不移地站在毛主席无产阶级革命路线一边，任凭刀山火海，为捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线而英勇奋斗，这就是一个革命者的最大的大节，是对伟大领袖毛主席的最大的忠。青海省无产阶级文化大革命的光辉史册，就是青海省无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众用“忠”字谱写的一支捍卫毛主席革命路线的响彻云霄的颂歌！
    今天，埋藏在党内的大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇垮台了，以他为首的资产阶级司令部全部摧毁了，他和他的同伙叛党叛国的滔天罪行，正在受到亿万革命人民的彻底清算。但是，我们应当清醒地认识到：两条路线的斗争并没有结束，而是以更隐蔽、更复杂的形式进行着。在路线斗争问题上是没有调和的余地的。每一个人都必然地要经历两条路线斗争的严峻考验，并在这个考验中表明自己的立场。在我们革命队伍里，有少数同志被鞭炮的硝烟呛住了鼻子，被喜报挡住了眼睛，闻不到阶级斗争和路线斗争的味道了，看不到在磨刀霍霍的阶级敌人了，他们以为可以高枕无忧地睡大觉了；还有的人甚至敌我不分，不自觉地干着亲者痛、仇者快的蠢事，这是十分危险的。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“党内不同思想的对立和斗争是经常发生的，这是社会的阶级矛盾和新旧事物的矛盾在党内的反映。”因此，我们要念念不忘党内两条路线的斗争，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线要天天学习，天天执行，天天捍卫；对刘少奇的资产阶级反动路线和各种错误倾向要天天批判，批深批透，批倒批臭。只有这样，才能不断提高我们的两条路线斗争觉悟，不断提高我们执行毛主席无产阶级革命路线的自觉性，才能有效地巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，保证我们社会主义江山千秋万代永不变色。
    我作为一个参加青海省革命委员会的工人阶级的代表，一定要带头学好用好毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告和一系列最新指示，进一步用毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的学说武装自己，不断地提高阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，永远不忘毛主席的“务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风”的伟大教导，时刻警惕资产阶级“糖衣炮弹”的袭击，在斗争中不断地提高自己的政治觉悟，永葆工人阶级的革命本色。
    我们青海省工人阶级一定紧密地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，积极响应无产阶级司令部的战斗号召，充分利用刘少奇这个反面教员，继续深入开展革命大批判，在大批判中认真地学习党内两条路线斗争的历史。伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“正确的政治的和军事的路线，不是自然地平安地产生和发展起来的，而是从斗争中产生和发展起来的。”我们一定要在当前的斗、批、改高潮中，更高地举起毛主席无产阶级革命路线的大旗，进一步深入开展两条路线的斗争，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
    毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！
