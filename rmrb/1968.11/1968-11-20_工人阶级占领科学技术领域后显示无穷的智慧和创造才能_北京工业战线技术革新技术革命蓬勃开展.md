The working class, after taking over the field of science and technology, has demonstrated boundless wisdom and creativity. The technological innovation and revolution in Beijing's industrial front are thriving.

Broad masses of workers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have severely criticized the capitalist-roaders and the reactionary "authorities" of the bourgeoisie who dared not create and suppressed workers' creativity, depriving workers of their rights to innovation. They have fully unleashed the revolutionary pioneering spirit of the working class, promoting a leap in production.

Xinhua News Agency, November 19th: As the struggle, criticism, and transformation movement deepens, a magnificent wave of mass technological innovation and revolution is surging on the industrial front in the capital. Workers in the capital, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have quickly shown boundless wisdom and creativity in the field of science and technology, promoting a leap in production.

For decades, the old framework of using firing methods to manufacture various refractory bricks has been broken. Workers in the capital have successfully experimented with a new type of cast iron brick that does not require firing, significantly improving product quality and saving coal, opening up a new path for the revolution in refractory brick production.

Steelworkers have broken through various unreasonable regulations and created experiences in rapid steel smelting in electric furnaces. This has reduced the average smelting time of electric furnace steel by one-fourth compared to the past, significantly increasing steel production.

A tall and precise distillation tower imported from a capitalist country as a patented device for the recovery of acetic acid from coal tar has been cleverly replaced by workers in the capital with a small gas-liquid separator. After the replacement, production is normal, the quality is qualified, and the output has increased by 25%.

The first set of flat-type silicon components and equipment in China, which catch up with or surpass the advanced level of similar foreign products, the first automatic pressure regulator, the first automatic spot welder, and other important new products are now all created by the army of technological innovation and revolution, with ordinary workers as the main force.

These outstanding creations and technological innovation achievements by workers in the capital have made the production level of a number of advanced factories and enterprises increase by several times or even ten times compared to before the Cultural Revolution, leaving capitalist philistines and right-wing conservatives dumbfounded. All this fully proves the irrefutable truth of the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching: "The lowly are the wisest! The noble are the most foolish!"

The movement of technological innovation and revolution on the industrial front in the capital has always been a fierce struggle between two lines. The traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of Peng Zhen have long promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods of "expert management," "crawling," and "slave philosophy" in Beijing's factories and enterprises, making the technical power of the factories seized by some unlearned bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities." These people, high above, detached from reality, clinging to foreign frameworks and old books, could not come up with any innovations. The capitalist-roaders and bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" also used various rules and regulations to shackle the workers' hands and feet, using methods of control, suppression, and restriction to stifle the workers' creativity. According to an investigation by the Beijing Xinhua Printing Factory, since 1958, out of the more than 420 technological innovation and revolution projects in this factory, more than 90% were done by workers, while the bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" did not contribute a single item. However, before the Cultural Revolution, to carry out a technological innovation in this factory, even to drill a hole on a machine, one had to go through twelve approval procedures and more than 150 regulations, making it impossible for workers to even touch the machines they operated. The plastic roller made by workers, which clearly surpassed foreign advanced levels in all aspects, was restricted by the capitalist-roaders and bourgeois technical "authorities," who continued to import from abroad. It was not until this Cultural Revolution that the capitalist-roaders and bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" collapsed, and the plastic roller created by workers was widely promoted. Such situations exist in many factories in Beijing.

Workers in the capital have deeply felt from a large number of practices: the key lies in leadership. Whether the leadership of factories and enterprises is in the hands of the working class or the bourgeoisie is the fundamental issue of whether the wisdom and talents of the worker masses can be fully utilized to carry out technological innovation and revolution.

In the great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the working class seized the leadership power of factories and enterprises from a handful of capitalist-roaders, opening up an endless broad road for technological innovation and revolution. Revolutionary workers and staff in the capital, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, severely exposed and criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents, seized the leadership of science and technology from the bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities," smashed the old rules and regulations that shackled the workers' creativity, and with the attitude of masters, started technological innovation and revolution from the needs of revolution and production. Many factories and enterprises, under such circumstances, established technological innovation small groups composed of workers as the main force, with revolutionary cadres and revolutionary technical personnel participating, achieving one brilliant victory after another. The reactionary capitalist-designed thyristor rectifier in the Beijing Transformer Factory was large in size, small in capacity, and low in utilization rate. Workers had long criticized it as a "paper tiger" that eats much but works little, and repeatedly requested its elimination and modification, but the capitalist-roaders in the factory praised it as a treasure, even exhibiting it abroad, and firmly opposed any changes. During the Cultural Revolution, workers seized the technical leadership power, resolutely adopted advanced technology, and carried out thorough reforms. They broke the conventions, designed, tested, and improved simultaneously, and only took eight days to successfully test the new thyristor rectifier, which had better quality, reduced volume to one-sixth of the original, and reduced weight to one-fourth of the original. With the same working hours and raw materials, they can now produce much more products for the state.

The process of testing the sixteen-roll rolling mill in the Beijing Third Rolling Mill also vividly shows that the working class, after seizing the technical leadership power, can create miracles. Our country urgently needs extremely thin steel strips. Previously, this factory could only produce steel strips as thin as 0.1 millimeters using a four-roll rolling mill. Revolutionary workers organized to experiment with converting the four-roll rolling mill into an eight-roll rolling mill, but a handful of capitalist-roaders, using the excuse that the experiment would affect production tasks, ordered the dismantling of the experimental equipment several times. During the Cultural Revolution, the worker masses, with the attitude of masters, actively participated in the testing work, made 18 major modifications to the original design, and finally successfully tested the eight-roll rolling mill that could roll 0.025-millimeter-thin steel strips. Subsequently, the worker masses, with great revolutionary daring, under the support of the factory revolutionary committee and the PLA Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, overcame numerous difficulties and successfully tested the sixteen-roll rolling mill with an even higher level that could roll 0.015-millimeter-thin steel strips. The thinness of this steel strip is less than one-fourth the diameter of a single hair.

In the high tide of technological innovation and revolution, every time a major innovation is achieved, the worker masses would bring a handful of capitalist-roaders and bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" to the site for criticism. The worker masses, on the one hand, enthusiastically shared their experiences in learning from and applying Mao Zedong Thought, exhibiting and demonstrating their innovative achievements on the spot, and on the other hand, severely criticized the capitalist-roaders and bourgeois reactionary "authorities" for not daring to create and suppressing the workers' creative spirit, depriving the workers of their innovation rights. These criticisms greatly boosted the morale of the working class and crushed the arrogance of the bourgeoisie, continuously pushing the mass technological innovation and revolution movement forward.

　　工人阶级占领科学技术领域后显示无穷的智慧和创造才能
　　北京工业战线技术革新技术革命蓬勃开展
    广大工人以毛泽东思想为武器，狠批走资派、资产阶级反动“权威”自己不敢创造还压制工人创造、剥夺工人革新权利的罪行，充分发挥了工人阶级的革命首创精神，促进了生产的飞跃发展
    新华社十九日讯　随着斗、批、改运动的深入发展，一个波澜壮阔的群众性技术革新和技术革命高潮正在首都工业战线蓬勃兴起。用毛泽东思想武装起来的首都工人阶级占领科学技术领域，很快就显示出无穷的智慧和创造才能，促进了生产的飞跃发展。
    多少年来国内外沿袭使用的用烧成方法制造各种耐火砖的老框框被冲破了，首都工人已经试验成功了一种不需要烧的新型浇钢砖，大大提高了产品质量，节约了煤炭，为耐火砖生产的革命开辟了一条新路。
    炼钢工人破除种种不合理的规章制度，创造了电炉快速炼钢经验，它使电炉钢的冶炼时间平均比过去缩短四分之一，显著地提高了钢产量。
    资本主义国家作为专利设备向我国推销的一座分离焦油回收醋酸的高大精馏塔，已被首都工人用一个小小的气液分离器巧妙地代替了。代替后生产正常，质量合格，产量还提高百分之二十五。
    赶上或超过国外同类产品先进水平的我国第一套平板型硅元件及装置、第一台调压变压器、第一台自动点焊机等重要新产品，现在都由以普通工人为主体的技术革新、技术革命大军创制出来了。
    首都工人的这些出色的创造和技术革新成果，使得一批先进工厂企业的生产水平比文化大革命前成倍地甚至成十倍地增长，使得资产阶级庸人和右倾保守主义者为之目瞪口呆。这一切充分证明了伟大领袖毛主席教导的“卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢”这个颠扑不破的真理。
    首都工业战线的技术革新、技术革命运动，一直存在着两条路线的激烈斗争。叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇和彭真反革命修正主义集团，长期以来在北京工厂企业推行“专家治厂”、“爬行主义”、“洋奴哲学”等反革命修正主义黑货，使工厂技术大权被一些不学无术的资产阶级反动技术“权威”所篡夺。这些人高高在上，脱离实际，死守着洋框框、旧书本，根本搞不出什么革新。走资派和资产阶级反动技术“权威”还利用各种条条框框来束缚工人的手脚，用管、压、卡的办法扼杀工人的创造。据北京新华印刷厂调查，从一九五八年以来，这个厂搞出的四百二十多项技术革新和技术革命项目中，工人搞的占百分之九十以上，而资产阶级反动技术“权威”搞出的一项也没有。但是，在文化大革命前，这个厂的工人要想搞一项技术革新，甚至在机器上打一个孔，都要经过十二道审批手续，一百五十多条规章制度，使工人连自己开的机器都不能动一动。工人冲破重重障碍试制成功的塑料胶滚明明在各方面都超过国外先进水平，走资派和资产阶级技术“权威”却限制使用，继续从国外进口，直到这次文化大革命，走资派和资产阶级反动技术“权威”纷纷垮台，工人创造的塑料胶滚才得到普遍推广。这种情况在北京不少工厂都有。
    首都工人阶级从大量的实践中深切体会到：关键在于领导权。工厂企业的领导权是掌握在工人阶级手里，还是掌握在资产阶级手里，这是能不能充分发挥工人群众的聪明才智，搞好技术革新、技术革命的根本问题。
    在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，工人阶级从党内一小撮走资派手里夺回了工厂企业的领导大权，为技术革新、技术革命开辟了无限宽广的道路。首都广大革命职工以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，狠揭狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其代理人推行的反革命修正主义路线，从资产阶级反动技术“权威”手里夺回了科学技术的领导权，大破束缚工人创造力的旧规章制度，以主人翁的姿态，从革命和生产的需要出发大搞技术革新和技术革命。许多工厂企业正是在这样的情况下，成立了以工人为主体、有革命干部和革命技术人员参加的三结合技术革新小组，取得了一个又一个的辉煌战果。北京变压器厂的一个反动资本家设计的可控硅整流器，体积大、容量小、利用率低。工人群众早就批评它是个吃饭多，干活少，华而不实的“纸老虎”，一再要求淘汰改制，厂内走资派却捧为至宝，甚至拿它到国外展出，坚决不同意修改。文化大革命中，工人夺回了技术领导大权，坚决采用先进技术，大刀阔斧地进行改革。他们打破常规，边设计边试制边改进，只用八天时间就把新型的可控硅整流器试制出来，质量比过去好，而体积缩小到原来的六分之一，重量只有原来的四分之一，用同样的工时和原材料现在可以为国家生产出多得多的产品。
    北京第三轧钢厂试制十六辊轧机的过程，也生动地表明，工人阶级掌握了技术领导大权，就能创造出奇迹。我国建设十分需要极薄的带钢。过去这个厂只能用四辊轧机生产薄到零点一毫米的带钢。革命职工组织起来试验把四辊轧机改造成八辊轧机，一小撮走资派却以试验影响生产任务为名，几次下令把试验装置拆去。在文化大革命中，工人群众以主人翁态度积极投入试制工作，对原设计作了十八处较大的修改，终于试制成功了能够轧制零点零二五毫米薄的带钢的八辊轧机。接着，工人群众又以大无畏的革命气概，在厂革委会和驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的支持下，克服了重重困难，试制成功了水平更高能够轧制零点零一五毫米带钢的十六辊轧机，这种带钢的薄度还不到一根头发丝直径的四分之一。
    在技术革新、技术革命高潮中，广大工人群众每当一项重大革新取得成功，就把一小撮走资派和资产阶级反动技术“权威”揪到现场进行批判。工人群众一面大讲特讲活学活用毛泽东思想取得胜利的心得体会，当场展出和表演自己的革新成果，一面狠揭狠批走资派、资产阶级反动“权威”自己不敢创造还压制工人创造精神、剥夺工人革新权利的罪行。这些批判，大长了工人阶级的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风，把群众性的技术革新、技术革命运动不断推向前进。
