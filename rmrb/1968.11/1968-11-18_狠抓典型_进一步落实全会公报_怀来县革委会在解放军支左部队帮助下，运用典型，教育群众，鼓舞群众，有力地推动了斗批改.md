The Huailai County Revolutionary Committee, with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army's support-leftist troops, has used typical cases to educate and inspire the masses, effectively promoting the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

The Huailai County Revolutionary Committee in Hebei Province, in the process of implementing the Twelfth Plenum Report, has followed Chairman Mao's instructions: "Any leading cadre who does not learn from the specific experiences of individual units, individuals, and specific events cannot provide universal guidance to all units." The committee has combined the study and implementation of the report's various combat tasks with the specific conditions of the region, further promoting the continuous development of the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

During the propaganda and implementation of the report, the county revolutionary committee, with the help of the support-leftist troops, followed Chairman Mao's teachings: "If one only makes general calls but does not implement the work called for in some organizations in a specific and direct manner, breaking through one point, gaining experience, and then using this experience to guide other units, one cannot verify the correctness of the general call, nor can one enrich the content of the general call, thus risking the general call becoming empty." The committee combined general calls with specific guidance, focusing on typical cases, setting up models, and using advanced typical cases to inspire and educate the masses. The committee, except for a few people on duty, all went to various communes and brigades to conduct investigations and research, summarizing experiences in studying and implementing the report.

Comrades on the front lines discovered that in the revolutionary criticism, a few people felt that the big piece of junk, Liu Shaoqi, had been removed and could no longer cause any trouble, so they could relax.

To solve this problem, members of the county revolutionary committee went to the Maojiahe Brigade, summarizing the brigade's typical experiences in revolutionary criticism. This brigade's criticism was deep and thorough, and they persisted. After the Twelfth Plenum Report was issued, they actively responded to the report's call, organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and earnestly implemented the Party's Eighth Central Committee Twelfth Plenum Report, quickly launching a powerful wave of revolutionary criticism. They created three experiences: first, using the report as a weapon, starting from recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, raising awareness of the importance of revolutionary criticism; second, implementing the report must focus on class struggle; third, focusing on key issues for criticism and transformation, breaking and establishing, fighting a decisive battle to eliminate Liu Shaoqi's revisionist thoughts. To solve the issues of "criticism to the end" and "only criticism, no transformation," they mobilized the masses to severely criticize Liu Shaoqi's mad opposition to Mao Zedong Thought, deeply carrying out the mass activity of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought; severely criticizing Liu Shaoqi and his agents' advocacy of "work points as the criterion" and "material incentives" and other fallacies, taking Dazhai as an example, establishing the advanced system of emphasizing proletarian politics; severely criticizing Liu Shaoqi and his agents' promotion of "self-management, self-reliance, and self-dependence" and "four freedoms," establishing the firm idea of taking the collective path of agricultural collectivization; severely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's theory of "class struggle extinction," establishing the concept of class struggle. The county revolutionary committee believed that the experiences created by the Maojiahe Brigade have great guiding significance for the county's in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism. Therefore, through various methods, they introduced and promoted their experiences. Some comrades with relaxation sentiments, after hearing their experiences, deeply felt: "The gap has been found, the direction is clearer." The entire county's communes, brigades, institutions, and schools quickly launched a mass movement of denouncing and criticizing Liu Shaoqi and other top walkers within the Party who attempted to restore capitalism.

The revolutionary committee selected twenty typical cases that created different advanced experiences in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the report. Then, through holding Mao Zedong Thought experience exchange meetings, broadcasting, and other methods, they conducted extensive propaganda, quickly making these experiences of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the report known to the broad masses of the county. In this way, the county's struggle, criticism, and transformation were carried out both vigorously and solidly.

　　狠抓典型　进一步落实全会公报
    怀来县革委会在解放军支左部队帮助下，运用典型，教育群众，鼓舞群众，有力地推动了斗批改
    本报讯　河北省怀来县革命委员会，在落实十二中全会公报的过程中，遵照毛主席关于“任何领导人员，凡不从下级个别单位的个别人员、个别事件取得具体经验者，必不能向一切单位作普遍的指导”的教导，把学习、落实公报提出的各项战斗任务和本地区的具体情况结合起来，进一步推动了斗批改高潮不断向前发展。
    在宣传、落实公报过程中，县革委会在支左解放军帮助下，遵照毛主席的教导：“如果只限于一般号召，而领导人员没有具体地直接地从若干组织将所号召的工作深入实施，突破一点，取得经验，然后利用这种经验去指导其他单位，就无法考验自己提出的一般号召是否正确，也无法充实一般号召的内容，就有使一般号召归于落空的危险。”把一般号召同具体指导结合起来，大抓典型，树立样板，运用先进典型鼓舞群众，教育群众。革委会除留少数人值班外，其余都深入各个社队去作调查研究，总结学习落实公报的经验。
    到第一线的同志发现，在革命大批判中，有少数人觉得刘少奇这块大废料被清除出去，再也成不了什么气候了，可以松口气了。
    为了解决这个问题，县革委会成员深入姚家河大队，总结了这个大队革命大批判的典型经验。这个大队革命大批判批得深，批得透，又能坚持不懈。十二中全会公报发表以后，他们积极响应公报的号召，大办毛泽东思想学习班，认真落实党的八届十二中全会公报，很快就掀起了声势浩大的革命大批判高潮。他们创造了三条经验：一是以公报为武器，从忆苦思甜入手，提高对革命大批判重要意义的认识；二是落实公报必须狠抓阶级斗争；三是抓住要害问题大批大改，大破大立，打一场肃清刘少奇修正主义思想的歼灭战。为了解决
  “批判到头”和“光批不改”的思想，他们广泛发动群众狠批刘少奇疯狂反对毛泽东思想的罪行，深入开展群众性活学活用毛泽东思想的活动；狠批刘少奇及其代理人鼓吹的“工分挂帅”、“物质刺激”等谬论，以大寨为榜样，大立突出无产阶级政治的先进制度；狠批刘少奇及其代理人推行的“三自一包”、“四大自由”等反革命修正主义黑货，大立坚定不移地走农业集体化道路的思想；狠批刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，大立阶级斗争观念。县革委会认为，姚家河大队创造的这些经验，对全县深入持久地开展革命大批判有很大的指导作用。于是，就通过各种方法，介绍推广了他们的经验。一些有松劲情绪的同志，听了他们的经验后，深有体会地说：“差距找到了，方向更明了。”全县社、队、机关、学校迅速掀起了一个人人口诛笔伐，狠批刘少奇等党内最大的一小撮走资派妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行的群众运动。
    县革委会共选择了二十个在落实毛主席最新指示、落实公报的过程中，创造了不同先进经验的典型。然后，通过召开活学活用毛泽东思想经验交流会，举办有线广播等方法，进行大张旗鼓的宣传，很快就使这些落实毛主席最新指示、落实公报的经验，同全县广大群众见面。这样就使全县的斗批改既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实地开展起来。
