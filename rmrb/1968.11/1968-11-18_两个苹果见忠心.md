At the welcome meeting for the National Day celebration representatives held in Liaoyuan City, Jilin Province, students from the Liaoyuan Deaf-Mute School, along with representatives from the workers and the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the school, presented a red paper package to the National Day celebration representatives.

Inside the red paper package were two ordinary apples. These two apples were filled with the proletarian feelings of boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao from the workers, the People's Liberation Army, and the deaf-mute students.

Since Chairman Mao sent the People's Liberation Army to cure the deaf-mute students' illnesses, enabling them to hear the voice of the great leader Chairman Mao and sing the most beautiful song "The East Is Red," the students' feelings towards the great leader Chairman Mao have been like a dam bursting after being held back for many years. They formed a Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, created dozens of cultural performances, and performed in streets, factories, military units, and schools, enthusiastically praising Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought.

Not long ago, this propaganda team was invited to perform in Changchun City. After more than ten consecutive performances, many students developed sore throats and hoarse voices. The leadership advised them to rest, but they refused. During one performance, due to excessive fatigue, a student fainted on stage. Upon regaining consciousness, he shouted, "Resolve to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory," and rushed back on stage. Their actions moved many audience members to tears. A soldier from the People's Liberation Army, seeing the deaf-mute students' touching scene of boundless love for Chairman Mao, was deeply moved. He ran onto the stage and gave the two apples from his pocket to the performing students as a token of encouragement. He said, "Comrades, you are right! You are doing the right thing! We must use the strongest voice in the world to sing for our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. Please take an apple to moisten your throats and sing to your heart's content!"

At that time, the students were very thirsty, but they passed the apples from one to another, none of them willing to eat. They said, "This is the care of the soldiers from the People's Liberation Army, the most precious proletarian feelings." The students held these two apples and solemnly swore in front of Chairman Mao's portrait: "We will not disappoint the expectations of the soldiers from the People's Liberation Army and will definitely do a better job in propagating Mao Zedong Thought." They also decided to present these two ordinary apples to the most loyal person to the great leader Chairman Mao. Thus, these two ordinary apples were respectfully handed over to the National Day celebration representatives.

　　两个苹果见忠心
    在吉林省辽源市军民欢迎国庆观礼代表大会上，辽源市聋哑学校的学生和驻校工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的代表，把一个红纸包献给了国庆观礼代表。
    红纸包里是两个普普通通的苹果。这两个苹果，饱含着工人阶级、人民解放军和聋哑同学对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的无产阶级感情。
    自从毛主席派来亲人解放军治好了聋哑同学的病，使他们听到了伟大领袖毛主席的声音，唱出了最美好的歌儿《东方红》，同学们对伟大领袖毛主席的感情，真象憋了多年的洪水猛地开了闸门一样。他们组成了一支毛泽东思想宣传队，编排了几十个文艺节目，到街头、工厂、部队、学校演出，热情地歌颂毛主席，歌颂伟大的毛泽东思想。
    不久前，这支宣传队被邀请到长春市宣传演出。连续十多场的紧张演出，使很多同学的喉咙发炎了，嗓子嘶哑了。领导上劝他们休息休息，他们怎么也不肯。一次演出中，由于过度的疲劳，有一个同学在台上昏倒了。他清醒过来，喊着“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，又跑上台去。他们的行动，感动得很多观众热泪盈眶。一位解放军战士看到聋哑同学这种无限热爱毛主席的动人情景，十分激动，跑上舞台，把兜里的两个苹果送给了演出的同学，作为慰问。他说：“同学们，你们做得对，做得好！我们就是要用世界上的最强音，歌唱我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席。请你们吃口苹果润润嗓子，尽情地唱吧！”
    当时，同学们都很干渴，但是，他们把苹果你传给我，我传给你，谁也舍不得吃。他们说：这是解放军叔叔对我们的关怀，是最珍贵的无产阶级感情。同学们拿着这两个苹果，在毛主席像前庄严宣誓：我们决不辜负解放军叔叔的期望，一定要更好地宣传毛泽东思想。并且决定：要把这两个苹果送给最忠于伟大领袖毛主席的人。于是，这两个普通的苹果，就被恭恭敬敬地送到国庆观礼代表的手里。
