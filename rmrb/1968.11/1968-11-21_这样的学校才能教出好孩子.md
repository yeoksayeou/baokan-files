The revolutionary suggestion made by comrades Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu in the *People's Daily* regarding the transfer of all public primary schools to the production brigades for administration has sparked heated discussions within our brigade's Revolutionary Committee and the group of poor and lower-middle peasants managing the school. Everyone unanimously agrees that the direction of this suggestion is completely correct, fully in line with Chairman Mao's latest directive to "have the most reliable allies of the working class in the countryside—the poor and lower-middle peasants—manage the schools," and fully in line with the wishes of us poor and lower-middle peasants. We believe that only in this way can we thoroughly carry out the educational revolution in the countryside, thoroughly change the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating our schools, and ensure that the leadership of rural schools is firmly in the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Our brigade's "May Seventh School" was established in August this year and transferred to the brigade for administration. Since the school has been managed by the poor and lower-middle peasants, the brigade has established a group of poor and lower-middle peasants to directly lead the school. The group decides on the courses to be offered and how they are to be taught. Among the eight teachers, two do not receive state salaries but are instead compensated by the brigade with work points as "barefoot teachers."

Although the school has only been under brigade administration for a short time, it has already shown many advantages. The most prominent benefit is that school education is closely linked to the actual class struggle and production struggle in the countryside, which is beneficial for cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

In the past, our school (a complete primary school) was under the leadership of the commune's central primary school, which in turn was under the leadership of the Changping County Education Bureau. Under the influence of the revisionist educational line, the school was seriously detached from the actual class struggle and production struggle in the countryside, and from the needs of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Our brigade engages in diversified operations, including agriculture and fruit trees. During the three autumn busy seasons, especially during the harvest and fruit-picking periods, it is very busy. At this time, all the poor and lower-middle peasants in the brigade hope that the school will close for the busy season, allowing the children to return to the brigade to participate in production. They have repeatedly suggested this to the school, but the school, citing "no orders from the Education Bureau," refused to close. The poor and lower-middle peasants were indignant, saying, "The school is in our village, the students are our poor and lower-middle peasants' children, but we poor and lower-middle peasants cannot manage it." In August this year, the school was transferred to the brigade for administration, and after we took control, the situation changed completely. During the three autumn busy seasons, the group of poor and lower-middle peasants managing the school immediately discussed and decided to close the school for two months for the busy season, with all teachers and students participating in the autumn harvest.

In the past, we poor and lower-middle peasants were also worried about another issue: the school being detached from politics and class struggle. Our brigade and production team's revolutionary criticism sessions were in full swing. However, the school was still spreading revisionist black goods. Now it's different. The group managing the school decided to establish courses on Mao Zedong Thought and revolutionary criticism. Students and teachers participate in the brigade and production team's criticism sessions, joining the poor and lower-middle peasants in criticizing the great traitor, great internal enemy, and great capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi's reactionary revisionist black goods in our village. This greatly aroused the students' hatred towards Liu Shaoqi and the handful of class enemies in our village. Now, even first and second-grade students in the "May Seventh School" can logically and convincingly criticize class enemies in criticism sessions, leaving them speechless. The poor and lower-middle peasants joyfully say, "This is the good children educated by us poor and lower-middle peasants."

Transferring primary schools to the brigades for administration, changing teachers' salaries to work points, and having them teach in their own brigades is a good way to thoroughly end the domination of schools by bourgeois intellectuals. We poor and lower-middle peasants are genuinely happy about this.

Transferring public primary schools to the brigades for administration first requires solving ideological issues. For example, whether changing teachers' state salaries to brigade work points increases the brigade's burden is a problem. We believe that the main consideration should be political. Because this relates to the big issue of who controls cultural power and what kind of successors our descendants will be. Once this issue is understood, the ideological problem will also be solved.

### 这样的学校才能教出好孩子

    这样的学校才能教出好孩子
    《人民日报》发表的侯振民、王庆余两同志关于把所有公办小学下放到大队来办的革命建议，我们大队革委会贫下中农管理学校小组展开了热烈的讨论。大家一致认为，这两位同志的建议大方向是完全正确的，完全符合毛主席“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校”的最新指示的精神，完全符合我们贫下中农的心愿，是个革命的倡议。我们认为，只有这样才能彻底搞好农村教育革命，才能“彻底改变资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象”，才能使农村学校的领导权完全掌握在贫下中农手里。我们大队的“五·七”学校，是今年八月下放到大队来办的。学校由贫下中农管理以后，大队成立了贫下中农管理学校小组进行直接领导。对学校设置什么课，怎样上课，全由咱管学小组讨论决定。八名教师中，有两名教师是不领取国家工资，而由大队记工的“赤脚教师”。
    学校下放到我们大队来办的时间虽然不长，但已显示出了许多好处。最突出的一个好处是：学校教育紧密结合农村阶级斗争、生产斗争的实际，有利于培养无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    过去，我们这个学校（完小）是受公社中心小学领导的，公社中心小学是受昌平县教育局领导的。在修正主义教育路线影响下，学校严重脱离了农村阶级斗争和生产斗争的实际，脱离了贫下中农的需要。我们大队是搞多种经营的，有农业，还有果树，每年到三秋大忙季节，收粮摘果特别忙。这时候，全队贫下中农都巴望学校放农忙假，让孩子回队参加生产，曾多次向学校提出建议，可是学校借口“教育局没有命令”，就是不放假。贫下中农气愤地说：“学校办在咱村，念书的是咱们贫下中农子女，可咱贫下中农却管不了。”今年八月，学校下放到大队来办，我们掌握了领导权后，情况就完全改变了。三秋大忙季节，贫下中农管学小组立即讨论决定，放两个来月的农忙假，教师、学生全部参加秋收。
    过去，咱贫下中农还担心一件事情，就是学校脱离政治，脱离阶级斗争。我们大队、生产队革命大批判搞得热火朝天。但是学校仍在灌输修正主义黑货。现在就不一样了。管学小组讨论决定，“五·七”学校设置毛泽东思想课、革命大批判课。让学生、教师参加大队、生产队的批判会，和贫下中农一起批判大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇在咱村推行的反革命修正主义黑货。这样大大激发了学生对刘少奇、对本村一小撮阶级敌人的无比仇恨。现在，在“五·七”学校，那怕是一、二年级的学生，在大批判会上，都能有理有据地把阶级敌人批斗得哑口无言。贫下中农高兴地说，这才是咱贫下中农管教出来的好孩子。
    把小学下放到大队来办，教师改为记工分，并回到本大队教学，这是彻底结束资产阶级知识分子统治学校的好办法，我们贫下中农从心坎里高兴。
    把公办小学下放到大队来办，首先要解决好思想问题。如教师由国家付工资改为大队记工分，是不是增加了大队的负担就是一个问题。我们认为，主要要算政治账。因为这关系到谁掌握文权和子孙后代成为什么样的接班人的大问题。这个问题认识清楚了，思想问题也就能解决了。
