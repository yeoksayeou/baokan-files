The Albanian people, who have been tempered by long years of struggle, are a heroic people standing tall and firm. Their glorious history of struggle shows that the Albanian people, who dare to struggle and dare to win, are invincible.

For more than two thousand years, the Albanian people have been waging a heroic struggle against foreign invaders and domestic class enemies. In the fifteenth century, when the Turks invaded, the Albanian people, under the leadership of the national hero Skanderbeg, fought a bloody battle for twenty-five years to resist Turkish aggression.

During the First World War, the Albanian people fought tenaciously against invaders from Greece, Yugoslavia, and Italy. In the Battle of Vlora in 1920, they drove the Italian invaders out of Albanian territory. In 1939, when the Italian Fascists attacked Albania, the people of the whole country rose up to fight against the occupiers.

On November 8, 1941, the Albanian Communist Party (today's Labor Party), led by the beloved leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, was founded. From then on, the struggle of the Albanian people entered a new and brilliant period. Under the leadership of the great Marxist-Leninist Comrade Enver Hoxha, the Albanian national liberation struggle quickly developed into an armed uprising. The National Liberation Army was established to fight bravely against foreign invaders and domestic reactionaries, and by 1944, the entire country was liberated. The flag of independence, won by the Albanian people through blood and sacrifice, once again flew over the motherland.

After liberation, under the leadership of the Labor Party headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, the Albanian people, surrounded by imperialism and modern revisionism, held high the revolutionary red flag of Marxism-Leninism and waged a resolute and uncompromising struggle against all kinds of enemies. Heroic Albania has become a great beacon of socialism in Europe.

The Tito clique has long harbored territorial ambitions against Albania. They cultivated agents, sent spies, and openly carried out armed provocations, plotting to overthrow the Albanian people's government and turn Albania into the "seventh republic of Yugoslavia." In 1960, the Tito clique, in collusion with the Greek reactionaries and the U.S. Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean, planned an armed attack on Albania. Against this revisionist neighbor that was eyeing Albania with greed, Albania not only resolutely repelled its aggressive activities and defended the independence and territorial integrity of the motherland but also exposed the traitorous face of the Tito clique.

Since the leaders of the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries degenerated into revisionism, the environment around Albania has undergone great changes. However, the heroic Albanian people, fearless of violence and difficulties, have waged an unyielding struggle against modern revisionism led by the Soviet revisionist clique.

At the 1960 Bucharest meeting, where the Soviet revisionist clique launched a sudden attack on the Communist Party of China, the Albanian Labor Party delegation insisted on Marxist-Leninist principles, refused to follow the orders of the Khrushchev clique, and resolutely opposed the sectarian activities of the Soviet revisionist clique. At the same year's meeting of the parties and workers' parties of various countries in Moscow, the Albanian Labor Party, together with the fraternal parties that insisted on Marxism-Leninism, waged a struggle against the Soviet revisionist clique, thwarting their various plots.

Since then, the Soviet revisionist clique has regarded the Albanian Labor Party as a thorn in their side, carrying out various evil activities and madly opposing Albania.

Since 1961, the Soviet revisionist clique has systematically and step-by-step expanded the ideological differences between the two parties into state relations with Albania.

In the spring of 1961, the Soviet revisionist clique unilaterally tore up agreements, withdrew experts from Albania, and expelled all Albanian students studying in the Soviet Union. Immediately afterward, it announced the cancellation of all loans to Albania through formal agreements, severing all diplomatic, economic, trade, scientific, technological, and cultural relations with Albania. The Soviet revisionist clique, together with its lackeys, imposed a comprehensive blockade on socialist Albania in political, economic, and military aspects.

However, the heroic Albanian people were not intimidated. Under the wise leadership of the great leader Comrade Enver Hoxha, they held a hoe in one hand and a gun in the other, carrying forward the spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle, smashing the blockade and sabotage by imperialism, the Soviet revisionist clique, and the Tito clique, and advancing victoriously on the road of building socialism.

Before withdrawing the experts, the Soviet revisionist clique concealed the true situation regarding oil geological exploration from the Albanian people and even wantonly destroyed Albania's oil geological exploration department. The Albanian people broke through numerous difficulties, forging their own path, and finally discovered new oil fields in areas where the Soviet "experts" claimed there would be "no oil at all," making new contributions to the development of the motherland's oil industry.

The Soviet "experts" maliciously spread the rumor that the "Bulqiza chromium mine has almost no future." However, the Albanian people did not believe this at all. Through their own efforts, they turned Bulqiza into a chromium mine area with great prospects, rapidly increasing Albania's chromium production.

In the construction of the "Stalin Hydroelectric Station," the Albanian people, under extremely difficult conditions, carved through mountains to build a nearly four-kilometer-long water diversion tunnel, once again smashing the revisionist "experts'" propaganda that "Mount Kloqi cannot be penetrated."

The Soviet revisionist clique attempted to "strangle" the Albanian people economically, but the Albanian people's determination to follow the socialist path is unshakable. They displayed boundless revolutionary enthusiasm, overcame countless difficulties and obstacles, and created countless miracles.

The great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, pointed out, "Our people have never been intimidated by the enemy, by difficulties and obstacles. They have not bowed to the Fascist occupiers, have not bowed to traitors, executioners, spies, and saboteurs who carry out diversionary attacks, have not bowed to the imperialists led by American imperialism, have not bowed to the Tito and Khrushchev revisionists, and have not bowed to terror, hunger, extortion, and blockade. Instead, they have always forged ahead bravely. They will do so in the future and will forever advance bravely."

Under the wise leadership of the Albanian Labor Party headed by the great Marxist-Leninist Comrade Enver Hoxha, the Albanian people are carrying out a magnificent revolutionization movement. This year, the educational revolution and worker supervision proposed by Comrade Enver Hoxha have given this movement even deeper content. The series of major measures taken by the Albanian Labor Party and the Albanian government in recent years, aimed at further strengthening and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration, have profound significance for ensuring Albania's victory on the socialist path.

Socialist Albania is a strong shock brigade against imperialism and revisionism. For a long time, the Albanian people have waged an uncompromising struggle against the Soviet revisionist clique's use of the Warsaw Pact for aggressive activities. Recently, Albania formally announced its withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact, which is a heavy blow to the Soviet revisionist clique and a great encouragement to the struggle of the peoples of Eastern European countries against the Soviet revisionist clique.

Currently, a new historical period of opposing U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism has arrived. The just struggle of the peoples of the world against U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism is surging.

The heroic Albanian people, holding high the revolutionary red flag of Marxism-Leninism, are advancing bravely on the road of revolutionization. They will certainly make even more brilliant contributions in this new revolutionary struggle.

    顶天立地的英雄人民
    郭边先
    久经斗争考验的阿尔巴尼亚人民，是顶天立地的英雄人民。他们的光荣斗争历史表明：敢于斗争、敢于胜利的阿尔巴尼亚人民是不可战胜的。
    两千多年来，阿尔巴尼亚人民不断对外国侵略者和国内阶级敌人进行英勇的斗争。十五世纪时，土耳其入侵，阿尔巴尼亚人民在民族英雄斯坎德培领导下，为反对土耳其的侵略，坚持了二十五年的浴血战斗。
    第一次世界大战期间，阿尔巴尼亚人民与来自希腊、南斯拉夫和意大利等国的侵略者进行了顽强的斗争。一九二○年的发罗那战役，把意大利入侵者赶出了阿尔巴尼亚国土。一九三九年，意大利法西斯进攻阿尔巴尼亚，全国人民奋起展开了反抗占领者的斗争。
    一九四一年十一月八日，以阿尔巴尼亚人民敬爱的领袖恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚共产党（即今天的劳动党）宣告成立，从此阿尔巴尼亚人民的斗争进入了光辉灿烂的新时期。在伟大的马克思列宁主义者恩维尔·霍查同志的领导下，阿尔巴尼亚民族解放斗争迅速发展成为武装起义，建立了民族解放军，同外国侵略者和国内反动派进行了英勇的斗争，于一九四四年解放了全部国土。阿尔巴尼亚人民经过流血牺牲赢得的独立旗帜，重新飘扬在祖国的上空。
    解放后，在帝国主义和现代修正主义的重重包围之中的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的劳动党领导下，高举马克思列宁主义的革命红旗，同一切形形色色的敌人展开了坚决的、毫不妥协的斗争。英雄的人民的阿尔巴尼亚，成为欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯。
    南斯拉夫铁托集团一直对阿尔巴尼亚抱有领土野心。他们培植代理人，派遣间谍，公开进行武装挑衅，阴谋颠覆阿尔巴尼亚人民政权，妄图把阿尔巴尼亚变成“南斯拉夫第七共和国”。一九六○年，铁托集团和希腊反动派，配合美国在地中海的第六舰队，策划过一次对阿尔巴尼亚的武装进攻。对于这个虎视眈眈的修正主义邻国，阿尔巴尼亚不但坚决地反击它的侵略活动，捍卫了祖国的独立和领土完整，而且有力地揭露了铁托集团的叛徒面目。
    自从苏联和一些东欧国家的领导集团堕落为修正主义以后，阿尔巴尼亚的周围环境起了很大的变化。但是，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民不畏强暴，不惧困难，同以苏修叛徒集团为首的现代修正主义进行了坚持不懈的斗争。
    在苏修叛徒集团对中国共产党发动突然袭击的一九六○年布加勒斯特会议上，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党代表团坚持马列主义原则，拒绝服从赫鲁晓夫集团的指挥棒，坚决反对苏修叛徒集团的宗派活动。在同年举行的各国共产党和工人党的莫斯科会议上，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党与坚持马列主义的兄弟党一道，对苏修叛徒集团进行了针锋相对的斗争，挫败了苏修叛徒集团的种种阴谋。
    从此，苏修叛徒集团把阿尔巴尼亚劳动党看作眼中钉，进行种种罪恶活动，疯狂地反对阿尔巴尼亚。
    一九六一年以来，苏修叛徒集团就有计划、有步骤地把苏阿两党的意识形态的分歧扩大到同阿尔巴尼亚的国家关系上。
    一九六一年春，苏修叛徒集团单方面地撕毁协议，从阿尔巴尼亚撤走专家，并且把阿尔巴尼亚的留苏学生全部赶走。紧接着，它又宣布取消通过正式协议规定给予阿尔巴尼亚的全部贷款，断绝了同阿尔巴尼亚的外交、经济、贸易、科学技术和文化等一切关系。苏修叛徒集团还伙同它的仆从，从政治、经济和军事等方面，对社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚进行全面的封锁。
    但是，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民并没有被吓倒。他们在伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志的英明领导下，一手拿镐、一手拿枪，发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的精神，粉碎了帝国主义、苏修叛徒集团、铁托叛徒集团的封锁和破坏，在建设社会主义的道路上胜利前进。
    苏修叛徒集团在撤走专家前对阿尔巴尼亚人民隐瞒了石油地质勘探方面的真实情况，甚至丧心病狂地对阿尔巴尼亚的石油地质勘探部门进行了大破坏。阿尔巴尼亚人民冲破了重重困难，走自己的道路，终于在苏修“专家”认为“根本不会有石油的地区”勘探出了新油田，为发展祖国的石油工业作出了新贡献。
    苏修“专家”心怀叵测地散播什么“布尔齐兹铬矿几乎没有任何发展前途”。但是，阿尔巴尼亚人民根本不信这一套，经过自己的努力，把布尔齐兹建设成为一个有很大发展前途的铬矿区，使阿尔巴尼亚的铬产量迅速提高。
    在建设“斯大林水电站”的工程中，阿尔巴尼亚人民在极端困难的条件下，劈山开岭，建成了近四公里长的引水大隧道，又一次粉碎了修正主义“专家”宣扬的“克洛基山不能打穿”的谰言。
    苏修叛徒集团妄想从经济上“卡”住阿尔巴尼亚人民，但是，阿尔巴尼亚人民走社会主义道路的决心是不可动摇的。他们发挥了冲天的革命干劲，克服了无数艰难险阻，创造出许多人间奇迹。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志指出，“我们人民从来没有被敌人所吓倒，被困难和障碍所吓倒。他们没有向法西斯占领者低头屈膝，没有向卖国贼、刽子手、进行牵制攻击的特务和破坏者低头屈膝，没有向以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义者低头屈膝，没有向铁托和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者低头屈膝，也没有向恐怖、饥饿、讹诈和封锁低头屈膝，而是一贯勇往直前。它将来也会如此，永远英勇向前。”
    在伟大的马克思列宁主义者恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的英明领导下，阿尔巴尼亚人民正在开展一场轰轰烈烈的革命化运动。今年上半年，恩维尔·霍查同志提出的教育革命和工人阶级监督，使这个运动具有更加深刻的内容。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚政府近几年来采取的旨在进一步加强和巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟的一系列重大措施，对于保证阿尔巴尼亚沿着社会主义道路胜利前进具有深远的意义。
    社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚，是一支反对帝国主义、反对修正主义的坚强的突击队。长期以来，阿尔巴尼亚人民对苏修叛徒集团利用华沙条约进行侵略活动展开了不妥协的斗争。最近，阿尔巴尼亚正式宣布退出华沙条约，这是对苏修叛徒集团一个沉重的打击，对于东欧各国人民反对苏修叛徒集团的斗争则是巨大的鼓舞。
    目前，一个反对美帝、苏修的历史新时期已经来到。世界各国人民反对美帝、苏修的正义斗争日益高涨。
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，高举着马克思列宁主义的革命红旗，正在革命化的道路上奋勇前进。他们一定会在这一场新的革命斗争中作出更加辉煌的贡献。
