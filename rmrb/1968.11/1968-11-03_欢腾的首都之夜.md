	At 8:30 PM on November 1, what an extraordinary moment it was! Countless people eagerly gathered around their radios and loudspeakers, waiting for this great moment to arrive. Many celebratory parades were ready to march out. On Chang'an Street, propaganda teams were pasting large sheets of colored paper on the walls, and brushes soaked in ink were also waiting for this extraordinary moment.

	At 8:30 PM, the red waves transmitted the joyous news of the successful conclusion of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the report of the plenary session personally presided over and approved by our great leader Chairman Mao. The entire capital was in a state of excitement. The lanterns for the festival at Tiananmen Square and Chang'an Street instantly lit up.

	“Most enthusiastically hail the convening of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China!” “Most resolutely implement all the combat tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China!” “Most resolutely support the expulsion of the great traitor, great spy, and great saboteur Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever!” … Giant banners instantly covered Beijing; countless celebratory parades surged from factories, rural areas, the army, government agencies, and schools towards Zhongnanhai.

	In front of the West Gate of Zhongnanhai, powerful spotlights turned the night into day. Here, it was a sea of red flags and a world of drums. Strings of firecrackers burst into the sky, and red and green paper snowflakes flew everywhere. The slogans from the celebratory parades rose and fell. All of this wove into a most touching scene and composed a most beautiful melody, expressing determination to the great Party and to the most beloved great leader Chairman Mao.

	The working class listens to Chairman Mao the most, and the working class is closest to Chairman Mao. The workers of the Beijing Motorcycle Factory, with their outstanding achievements in grasping the revolution and promoting production, were the first to arrive at Zhongnanhai to report their joy to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. The workers of the Xinhua Printing Factory, who have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and achieved great victories, came with immense excitement to express their determination to Chairman Mao. They said: “Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The red hearts of the 3,200 printing workers of the Beijing Xinhua Printing Factory are forever with you. We resolutely respond to your great call to thoroughly settle the accounts of Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices' crimes of betraying the Party and the country. We resolutely respond to your great call to ‘grasp the revolution and promote production,’ to print more and faster your red treasure book and your brilliant image, and to present the best results to the Ninth Party Congress…”

	Among the celebratory parade from the Beijing Power Supply Bureau was the old worker Jia Ziliang, who had recently joined the glorious Communist Party of China. At this moment, his heart was particularly excited. Chairman Mao personally issued the great call for the working class to lead everything, allowing the working class to take the stage of political struggle, criticism, and reform in various fields of the superstructure; and bestowed the great historical mission of leading everything upon the working class. He said with boundless affection: “Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You are forever heart-to-heart with us workers. Your wise decisions completely hit the mark in our hearts.”

	The representatives of the Second Four-Goods Regiment Conference of the People's Liberation Army Air Force, holding high the portrait of Chairman Mao and waving the red treasure book, came with vigorous steps to express their determination to Chairman Mao. They solemnly declared to Chairman Mao: “We will definitely study hard, understand thoroughly, implement resolutely, and comprehensively implement all the decisions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China…”

	In the flood of celebratory parades, there were also international friends from all continents. They held up the portrait of Chairman Mao, waving the red “Quotations from Chairman Mao,” and shouted in Chinese, “Long live Chairman Mao!” “Wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!” The heroic Albanian comrades, holding high the red flag, stood in front of the joyous platform, continuously shouting: “Wish Chairman Mao eternal life!” “Enver-Hoxha—Mao Zedong!” Another Albanian comrade excitedly said: We can celebrate the great victory of the Cultural Revolution with Chinese comrades and the publication of the report of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. This will be a day we will never forget. We Albanian people are as excited as you are because your victory is our victory…

	The sun rose in the east, and the sky was filled with radiant light. The workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, People's Liberation Army, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary Red Guards, and revolutionary intellectuals of the capital, despite the fatigue of staying up all night, were again, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and the leadership of the report of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, full of revolutionary enthusiasm, heading towards their respective battle stations!

    欢腾的首都之夜
    十一月一日下午八点三十分，这是一个多么不寻常的时刻啊！多少人怀着急切的心情，围坐在收音机旁，聚集在扩音器下，迎候着这个伟大时刻的到来。多少支贺喜的队伍等候着这个时刻，好整队出发。长安街上，一支支宣传队，把大张大张的彩纸，刷在墙上，蘸饱了墨汁的大笔，也在等候着这个不寻常的时刻。
    八点三十分，红色电波传来了中国共产党第八届扩大的十二中全会胜利闭幕的特大喜讯，传来了我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持通过的全会公报。首都全城沸腾了。天安门前，长安街上，节日的花灯，立时全开了。
    “最最热烈地欢呼党的八届扩大的十二中全会的召开！”“最最坚决地贯彻执行党的八届扩大的十二中全会提出的一切战斗任务！”“最坚决地拥护把大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇永远开除出党！”……巨幅的标语霎时写遍北京城；无数支贺喜的队伍，从工厂、农村，从部队、机关、学校，潮水似地涌向中南海。
    中南海西门前，强烈的聚光灯把夜晚变成白昼。这里是红旗的海洋，锣鼓的世界。一串串的花炮震破天空，红绿纸雪片似地飞扬。贺喜队伍中的口号声此起彼伏。这一切，织成一幅向伟大的党，向最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席表决心的最动人的画面，谱成了一曲最美妙的乐章。
    工人阶级最听毛主席的话，工人阶级跟毛主席最紧。北京摩托车厂的工人队伍带着他们抓革命、促生产的优异成绩，第一个来到中南海，向毛主席，向党中央报喜。在无产阶级文化大革命中紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，取得一个个伟大胜利的新华印刷厂工人，怀着无比激动的心情来向毛主席表决心，他们说：“毛主席啊，毛主席！我们北京新华印刷厂三千二百名印刷工人的红心，永远向着您，我们坚决响应您老人家的伟大号召，彻底清算刘少奇及其同伙叛党叛国的罪行。”“我们坚决响应您老人家‘抓革命，促生产’的伟大号召，多印、快印您老人家的红宝书和光辉形象，以最优异的成绩向党的第九次代表大会献礼……。”走在北京供电局贺喜队伍里的最近刚刚加入光荣的中国共产党的老工人贾自亮同志，此时此刻，心情特别兴奋。毛主席他老人家亲自发出“工人阶级必须领导一切”的伟大号召，让工人阶级大步登上了上层建筑各个领域斗、批、改的政治舞台；赋予工人阶级领导一切的伟大历史使命。他无限深情地说：“毛主席啊，毛主席！您永远和我们工人心连心，您的英明决定完全说到了我们工人阶级的心坎里。”
    中国人民解放军空军第二次四好连队代表大会的代表，高擎着毛主席的画像，挥动着红色的宝书，迈着雄健的步伐来了，来向毛主席表决心。他们庄严地向毛主席宣誓：“我们一定要努力学习、认真领会、坚决贯彻、全面落实党的八届扩大的十二中全会的一切决定……”
    在贺喜队伍的洪流中，还有来自世界各大洲的国际朋友，他们举着毛主席画像，挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，用汉语一遍遍地高呼“毛主席万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”英雄的阿尔巴尼亚战友，高举着红旗，站在报喜台前，不断地高呼：“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”“恩维尔—毛泽东！”另一位阿尔巴尼亚战友激动地说：我们能和中国同志一起欢庆文化大革命的伟大胜利，欢庆党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的发表，这将是我们终生难忘的日子，我们阿尔巴尼亚人民和你们一样的兴奋，因为你们的胜利，就是我们的胜利……。
    红日东升，霞光万道，首都的工人、贫下中农、人民解放军、革命干部、革命的红卫兵、革命知识分子，不顾通宵不眠的疲劳，又在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的指引下，满怀着革命的豪情，走向各自的战斗岗位！
