Workers' Propaganda Team Leads Art Workers in Deepening Revolutionary Criticism

The Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great directive on literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, together with the broad revolutionary art workers, has launched a fierce criticism of Liu Shaoqi's reactionary ideas of "professionalism first" and "fame and fortune," as reflected in the fallacy of "stage genius, off-stage genius." This has effectively promoted the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the entire troupe.

The Workers' Propaganda Team and the broad revolutionary art workers immediately launched a wave of learning and implementing the resolution of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee after its publication. During the study of the resolution, the Workers' Propaganda Team linked it with the history of class struggle in the literary and artistic circles, the battle course of the Cultural Revolution, and the revolutionary practice of leading the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the superstructure. They reviewed Chairman Mao's personally drafted "Sixteen Points," which states that "The bourgeoisie, although overthrown, is still trying to use the old ideas, culture, customs, and habits of the exploiting classes to corrupt the masses and win their hearts, aiming to achieve their goal of restoration." They deeply realized that the more than two years of the Cultural Revolution, although it had seized back the leadership from the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, Liu Shaoqi, and his accomplices, had not yet completely eliminated their reactionary revisionist thoughts. It is necessary to continue to deepen the revolutionary criticism, thoroughly eliminate the poisonous influence of Liu Shaoqi's reactionary revisionist thoughts, and complete the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the superstructure, including the cultural field, to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. The Workers' Propaganda Team and the broad revolutionary art workers unanimously agreed in their discussions that the fallacy of "stage genius, off-stage genius" advocated by the capitalist-roaders and reactionary "authorities" is a replica of Liu Shaoqi's ideas of "professionalism first" and "fame and fortune," and it is most prevalent in the Peking Opera Troupe. It is necessary to concentrate firepower to criticize it deeply and thoroughly.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the present world, all culture or literature and art belong to a certain class and a certain political line. Art for art's sake, classless art, and art that is parallel to or independent of politics do not exist in reality." During the revolutionary criticism, the Workers' Propaganda Team organized the broad revolutionary art workers to review, in light of Chairman Mao's teachings, their own experiences of carrying out the Peking Opera revolution under the leadership of Comrade Jiang Qing and creating the modern revolutionary Peking Opera "Sha Jianhuai." Everyone gained a clearer understanding that revolutionary literature and art are an important part of the proletarian revolutionary cause, that literature and art should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and that they should become "a powerful weapon for uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and annihilating the enemy." On this basis, everyone stood up to expose and denounce the reactionary nature of the capitalist-roaders and reactionary "authorities" in the troupe who had consistently advocated "art above all," "professionalism first," and "stage genius, off-stage genius." From the day they joined the troupe, these capitalist-roaders and reactionary "authorities" had relentlessly instilled the reactionary idea of "art is everything" into the young performers, claiming that "as long as the art is good, one can eat well, ride in cars, get promoted, have a raise, be in the newspapers and advertisements, and win awards abroad." Under this ideological poisoning, many young performers spent their days off-stage buried in their professional skills and on-stage fighting for that "one acre of land" (stage performance). As a result, the more they fought, the more politically confused they became, the more backward their thoughts were, and the more separated they were from their comrades. In 1963, when Comrade Jiang Qing instructed the Peking Opera Troupe to create the revolutionary model opera "Sha Jianhuai," the capitalist-roaders in the troupe wanted to perform "Si Lang Tan Mu" and "Yang Men Nu Jiang." In this extremely sharp and complex class struggle, some young performers could not distinguish the right direction, could not tell right from wrong, and fell into the trap of a handful of class enemies. Through the exposed facts, everyone clearly saw that a handful of capitalist-roaders and reactionary "authorities" in the Peking Opera Troupe had implemented Liu Shaoqi's reactionary revisionist literary and artistic black line, advocating the fallacy of "stage genius, off-stage genius." Their purpose was to seize the leadership of the literary and artistic front, to turn literary and art workers into politically confused individuals who only focus on their professional skills and do not care about state affairs, and to turn them into their "tame tools" for restoring capitalism.

In leading this criticism, the Workers' Propaganda Team also guided the broad revolutionary art workers to compare themselves with Comrade Jiang Qing's instructions on art workers to practice two basic skills, to link their own thoughts, to put themselves in the picture, and to combine the criticism of revisionism with the struggle against selfishness. A group of young performers, Li Guisen, came from a poor peasant family. In the old society, his grandfather had been a long-term laborer for the landlord for half his life, and his father had also suffered from the oppression and exploitation of the landlord. After liberation, he came to Beijing Kunqu Opera Troupe to study at the request of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and later worked in the Peking Opera Troupe. Under the poisoning of the reactionary revisionist literary and artistic line, he got up early and went to bed late, only focusing on practicing his skills, and his thoughts gradually changed, forgetting the bitterness of his class and losing the essence of the working people. Through studying the resolution, he actively participated in the revolutionary criticism, linked his thoughts, found the root cause of his recent lack of enthusiasm for practicing skills, which was the lingering poison of Liu Shaoqi's reactionary revisionist line of "fame and fortune" and "professionalism first," and decided to completely break with this reactionary thought, to practice hard skills for the revolution, and to perform revolutionary model operas for life.

The revolutionary criticism quickly raised the class struggle and line struggle awareness of the broad revolutionary art workers. Many comrades said: In the past, our goals were impure and our directions were wrong; the more "genius" we were on stage, the farther we were from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Now, under the leadership of Comrade Jiang Qing, we are carrying out the Peking Opera revolution, which is a struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, serving the proletariat. The more we practice, the clearer our minds become, the brighter our eyes become, and the more enthusiastic we are. The workers, peasants, and soldiers welcome us more. They are determined, under the leadership of the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, to follow the guiding principles of building the troupe pointed out by Comrade Jiang Qing: "Highly hoisting the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing proletarian politics, resolutely implementing the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line, uniting on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, completing the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and building the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe into a truly proletarianized and militarized revolutionary model troupe."

　　工人宣传队领导文艺工作者深入展开革命大批判
　　驻北京京剧团工人毛泽东思想宣传队遵循毛主席关于文艺为工农兵服务的伟大教导，同广大革命文艺工作者一起狠批刘少奇“业务第一”“成名成家”反动思想的翻版——“台上灵，台下就全灵”的谬论，有力地推动了全团的斗、批、改
    本报讯　驻北京京剧团工人毛泽东思想宣传队，领导广大革命文艺工作者，遵循毛主席关于文艺为工农兵服务的伟大教导，坚决响应党的八届十二中全会公报的号召，继续深入展开革命大批判，肃清刘少奇等党内最大的一小撮走资派的反革命修正主义的思想，狠批刘少奇在这个团的代理人及反动“权威”所鼓吹的“台上灵，台下就全灵”的反动谬论，彻底肃清刘少奇反革命修正主义文艺思想的流毒，从思想上夺取文艺阵地的领导权，推动了全团的斗、批、改。
    全会公报发表以后，工人宣传队和广大革命文艺工作者立即掀起了学习、执行公报的热潮。工人宣传队在学习公报过程中，联系文艺界阶级斗争的历史，联系文化大革命的战斗历程，联系领导上层建筑斗、批、改的革命实践，重温了毛主席亲自主持制定的《十六条》中关于“资产阶级虽然已经被推翻，但是，他们企图用剥削阶级的旧思想，旧文化，旧风俗，旧习惯，来腐蚀群众，征服人心，力求达到他们复辟的目的”的重要论述，深刻认识到：两年多的文化大革命，虽然夺回了党内最大走资派刘少奇及其同伙所篡夺的那一部分领导权，但是，他们的反革命修正主义思想还没有彻底肃清，必须继续深入开展革命大批判，彻底肃清刘少奇的反革命修正主义思想的流毒，才能完成上层建筑其中包括文化领域里的斗、批、改，巩固无产阶级专政。工人宣传队和广大革命文艺工作者，在讨论中一致认为，走资派和反动“权威”所鼓吹的“台上灵，台下就全灵”的反动谬论，是刘少奇“业务第一”“成名成家”思想的翻版，在京剧团流毒最广，必须集中火力把它批深批透。
    毛主席教导我们：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。为艺术的艺术，超阶级的艺术，和政治并行或互相独立的艺术，实际上是不存在的。”在革命大批判中，工人宣传队组织广大革命文艺工作者，对照毛主席的教导，回顾了自己在江青同志率领下，进行京剧革命，创造现代革命京剧《沙家浜》的战斗历程。大家更加明确认识到，革命文艺是无产阶级革命事业的重要组成部分，文艺要为工农兵服务，要成为“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器”。在提高认识的基础上，大家纷纷起来揭露和控诉了这个团的走资派和反动“权威”一贯鼓吹“艺术至上”“业务第一”“台上灵，台下就全灵”的反动本质。青年演员从进团第一天起，团里的走资派和反动“权威”就极力灌输“有了艺术就有了一切”的反动思想，胡说什么“只要艺术好，就可以吃好的，坐汽车，加级加奖，加工资，登报上广告，出国得奖章”，“要想人前显贵，必须背后受罪（指练技术功）。”在这种思想毒害下，许多青年演员每天台下埋头钻业务，台上拚命争那“一亩三分地”（舞台演出）。结果是越争政治上越糊涂，思想上越落后，同志之间越分离。一九六三年，江青同志指示京剧团创造革命样板戏《沙家浜》，这个团的走资派却要大演《四郎探母》《杨门女将》。在这极其尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，一些青年演员辨不清大方向，认不清是非，上了一小撮阶级敌人的当。通过揭发出来的活生生事实，大家清楚地看到：一小撮走资派、反动“权威”在京剧团推行刘少奇“成名成家”“业务第一”的反革命修正主义文艺黑线，鼓吹“台上灵，台下就全灵”的反动谬论，其目的就是要夺取文艺阵地的领导权，把文艺工作者培养成埋头业务、不关心国家大事的政治上的糊涂虫，变成他们复辟资本主义的“驯服工具”。
    在领导这场大批判中，工人宣传队还引导广大革命文艺工作者，对照江青同志对文艺工作者要练好两个基本功的指示，联系自己的活思想，把自己摆进去，把批修与斗私结合起来。一队青年演员李桂森是贫农家庭出身。旧社会爷爷给地主扛了大半辈子长工，父亲也受尽了地主的压迫和剥削。解放后，受贫下中农的委托来到北京昆剧院学习，后来到京剧团工作。在反革命修正主义文艺路线的毒害下，他起早睡晚只顾练业务，思想上慢慢起了变化，忘记了阶级苦，丢了劳动人民的本色。他通过学习公报，积极投入革命大批判，联系自己的思想，找到了最近练功劲头不大的根子，就是刘少奇“成名成家”“业务第一”的反革命修正主义路线的余毒没有彻底肃清的反映，决心和这种反动思想彻底决裂，为革命苦练硬功，演一辈子革命样板戏。
    革命大批判迅速提高了广大革命文艺工作者阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟。许多同志说：过去我们目的不纯、方向不正，台上越“灵”，离毛主席革命路线就越远。现在，我们在江青同志的率领下，进行京剧革命，是在和帝、修、反斗争，为无产阶级服务，我们越练心越明，眼越亮，劲头越足，工农兵越欢迎。他们决心在工人毛泽东思想宣传队的领导下，遵照江青同志指出的建团方针：“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，坚决贯彻执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的基础上团结起来，完成一斗、二批、三改的任务，把北京京剧团建设成为一个真正的无产阶级化的战斗化的革命样板团”。
