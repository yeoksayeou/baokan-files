The phrase “those who toil with their minds rule over others, those who toil with their strength are ruled by others” is a reactionary “philosophy” that has been advocated and practiced by all exploiting classes throughout history, from slave owners to capitalists, in order to maintain their reactionary rule and suppress the resistance of the laboring people. They cultivate or buy a group of “intellectual” intellectuals to help them rule and suppress the exploited and enslaved “laborers.” They also create reactionary public opinion, such as “all occupations are inferior, only reading is noble” and “learning leads to officialdom,” with the sole purpose of making intellectuals into tools of their reactionary rule to help them suppress and deceive the broad masses of laboring people.

The broad masses of laboring people are originally the creators of society’s material wealth and culture. However, the exploiting classes not only exploit the material wealth they create but also monopolize the cultural and educational front, making them the ruled. This is a great historical inversion, and it contains the blood and tears of generations of laboring people!

“Rouse the hundreds of millions of workers and peasants, and unite to work together.” Under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese people, after decades of arduous struggle, finally overthrew the three great mountains. The laboring people, who had always been ruled by others, suddenly became the masters of New China. This is a great change. Under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, the phenomenon of “those who toil with their minds rule over others, those who toil with their strength are ruled by others” must be thoroughly buried, and the inverted history must be inverted again!

However, the struggle is far from over. Those who exploit the labor of others, the landlords and capitalists, are still alive but their hearts are not dead. They always dream of a comeback, hoping to ride on the heads of the laboring people again. The traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi is their representative. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, led by Liu Shaoqi, particularly emphasize education, literature and art, ideology, and various fields of the superstructure, continuing to propagate the reactionary philosophy of “those who toil with their minds rule over others, those who toil with their strength are ruled by others.” They put forward extremely reactionary theories such as “reading books to become officials” and “going to the countryside to become officials,” attempting to cultivate intellectuals into new “rulers” of the “spiritual nobility,” plotting to open a breach from here to realize their dream of restoring capitalism.

Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters within the Party, headed by Liu Shaoqi. Now, the country is red all over, and a great wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation has arrived. It is necessary to thoroughly reform education, literature and art, and all superstructures that do not adapt to the socialist economic base, and thoroughly eradicate the poison of “those who toil with their minds rule over others, those who toil with their strength are ruled by others”!

How to fight this significant battle of struggle, criticism, and transformation? “The proletariat must transform the world according to its worldview, and the bourgeoisie also wants to transform the world according to its worldview.” Therefore, there is still a sharp struggle between the two classes and the two lines here. Under the great command of Chairman Mao that the working class must lead everything, with the People’s Liberation Army as the backing, the working class main force has taken the stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation of the superstructure. This is another great innovation in the international communist movement, and it is our heart’s reddest red sun, Chairman Mao, who has made another great development of Marxism-Leninism.

Fighting this battle of struggle, criticism, and transformation is to transform the various fields of the superstructure with the proletarian worldview. Ultimately, it is to strengthen the proletarian dictatorship and to make the superstructure adapt to the needs of the socialist economic base. The working class is most easily able to accept the worldview of its own class—Mao Zedong Thought, most able to learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought in struggle, and most able to unconditionally carry out the commands of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. The working class best understands the bitterness of the old society and the sweetness of the new society, best understands class struggle under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, is most thorough in revolution, and most able to completely break with all traditional and rotten ideas. The working class has accumulated the richest practical experience in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, has the most genuine talents and learning, best understands what kind of superstructure adapts to the needs of the socialist economic base, and best understands how to carry out struggle, criticism, and transformation to promote the leapfrog development of the socialist economy. Therefore, only the working class can lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the superstructure.

Under the socialist system, all intellectuals who are willing to accept reform under the leadership of the working class have a broad future. We sincerely hope that they will honestly accept the leadership of the working class, “receive re-education from the workers, peasants, and soldiers,” thoroughly eradicate the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the great traitor Liu Shaoqi, get rid of the influence of the reactionary and rotten idea of “those who toil with their minds rule over others, those who toil with their strength are ruled by others,” quickly catch up with the magnificent revolutionary steps of the workers and peasants, and resolutely “combine with the workers, peasants, and soldiers.” “Such intellectuals are welcomed by the workers, peasants, and soldiers.”

    肃清反革命修正主义教育路线的流毒
    群向阳
    “劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”，这是历史上一切剥削阶级，从奴隶主到资本家，为了维护他们的反动统治，镇压劳动人民的反抗，都无例外地宣扬和奉行的反动“哲学”。他们培植或收买一批“劳心”的知识分子，帮助他们统治镇压被剥削被奴役的“劳力者”。他们还大造反动舆论，什么“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”啦，什么“学而优则仕”啦，目的无非是要知识分子充当他们反动统治的工具，帮助他们镇压和愚弄广大劳动人民。
    广大劳动人民，本来是社会物质财富和文化的创造者，可是，剥削阶级不但剥削他们创造的物质财富，而且垄断着文化教育阵地，使他们处于“治于人”的被统治地位。这是一个极大的历史颠倒，其中包藏了世世代代劳动人民的多少血泪仇和阶级恨啊！
    “唤起工农千百万，同心干”。伟大领袖毛主席他老人家领导全国人民，经过几十年艰苦卓绝的斗争，终于推翻了三座大山，历来“治于人”的劳动人民，一跃而成为新中国的主人。这是一个翻天覆地的大变化。在无产阶级专政条件下，应当彻底埋葬“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的现象，把颠倒了的历史再颠倒过来！
    然而，斗争远远没有结束。那些“劳”剥削之“心”的地主资产阶级，人还在心不死，他们时刻梦想复辟，重新骑在劳动人民头上。叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇就是他们的总代表。以刘少奇为首的党内一小撮走资派，特别重视抓教育，抓文艺，抓意识形态，抓上层建筑的各个领域，继续宣扬“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的反动哲学，抛出反动透顶的“读书做官”论、“下乡做官”论等等谬论，妄想把知识分子培养成新的“治人”的“精神贵族”，阴谋从这里打开缺口，实现复辟资本主义的迷梦。
    毛主席他老人家亲自发动和领导了无产阶级文化大革命，把隐藏在党内的以刘少奇为首的资产阶级司令部彻底粉碎了。现在，全国山河一片红，一个伟大的斗、批、改的高潮已经到来。必须彻底改革教育、改革文艺、改革一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑，彻底肃清“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的流毒！
    怎样打好意义重大的斗、批、改这一仗？“无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。”因此，这里仍然存在着两个阶级、两条路线的尖锐斗争。在伟大领袖毛主席的工人阶级必须领导一切的伟大号令下，以人民解放军做后盾，工人阶级主力军登上了上层建筑斗、批、改的舞台。这是国际共产主义运动的又一伟大创举，这是我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席对马克思列宁主义的又一巨大发展。
    打好斗、批、改这一仗，就是用无产阶级世界观改造上层建筑各个领域。它归根到底，正是为了加强无产阶级专政，正是为了使上层建筑适应社会主义经济基础的需要。工人阶级最容易接受自己阶级的世界观——毛泽东思想，最能够在斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想，最能够不折不扣地贯彻执行以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的一切号令。工人阶级最懂得旧社会的苦、新社会的甜，最懂得无产阶级专政条件下的阶级斗争，最富于革命的彻底性，最能够同一切传统的腐朽的观念彻底决裂。工人阶级在阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动中积累了最丰富的实践经验，最有真才实学，最懂得什么样的上层建筑才适合社会主义经济基础的需要，最懂得怎样进行斗、批、改才能促进社会主义经济的飞跃发展。因此，只有工人阶级才能领导上层建筑的斗、批、改。
    在社会主义制度下，一切愿意在工人阶级领导下接受改造的知识分子都有着广阔的前途。我们热切期望他们，老老实实接受工人阶级领导，“由工农兵给他们以再教育”，彻底肃清大叛徒刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线的流毒，摆脱“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的反动腐朽观念的影响，尽快地跟上工农群众雄伟的革命步伐，下决心“同工农兵结合”，“这样的知识分子，工农兵是欢迎的。”
