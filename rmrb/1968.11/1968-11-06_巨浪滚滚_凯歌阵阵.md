The blue sky and white clouds are carrying
The great news, the green mountains and clear waters are echoing
A voice: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao! Closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao
March forward bravely,
March forward bravely! The unprecedentedly united meeting of the Party Central Committee
Inspires the seven hundred million revolutionary people. The vast and magnificent
Cultural Revolution of the proletariat,
Waves are rolling, the unyielding
Revolutionary line of Chairman Mao,
Songs of victory are resounding. The wise decision of the Party Central Committee is greatly satisfying. Resolutely overthrow
The traitor to the Party and the country, Liu Shaoqi, let him never rise again! Expel Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever, thoroughly settle their crimes of usurping the Party, the government, and the military! The brilliant directives of the Party Central Committee are deeply ingrained in people's hearts. The working class holds high the red flag, the movement of struggle, criticism, and transformation reaches a new high, the superstructure takes on a new look. Intellectuals pack their bags, go to factories and the countryside, transform their souls. The battle cry of the Party Central Committee is inspiring. The unity of military and civilians strengthens national defense, protects the red regime, and monitors the class enemy. The wolves of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism dare to take risks, we will completely annihilate them! Across rivers and mountains, the great news is carried,
Across the five continents and four seas, a voice echoes:
Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao! Closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao
March forward bravely,
March forward bravely!
