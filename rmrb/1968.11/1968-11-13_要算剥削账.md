Teachers at the Five Metal Primary School in Yu Lin County, Guangxi, encountered difficulties while discussing how to reform arithmetic teaching materials. Some teachers feared making mistakes and cited a lack of experience, advocating for waiting for higher authorities to make changes. Others believed that arithmetic, whether it involves addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, is essential and that reforming it is not a significant issue. Opinions varied, and no consensus was reached.

The deputy head of the school management committee, old poor peasant Zhou Chengshi, sat listening and thinking. The more he listened, the more he felt that the mindset of "eating ready-made meals" and "cooking old dishes" was wrong. If this continued, how could the school's educational revolution be thorough? How could Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line be implemented? He recalled that some graduates of primary schools in the past, upon returning to the production teams, did not want to be accountants and looked down on manual labor. The more he thought about it, the more he hated the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. The more he thought, the more he felt that Chairman Mao's teaching of "education must be revolutionized" was extremely wise and correct. If the old educational system was not thoroughly reformed, the descendants of the poor and lower-middle peasants would become revisionists, and the country would change color. Thinking of this, he decided to help the teachers correct their attitudes and improve arithmetic teaching reform.

How should arithmetic teaching reform be conducted?

With an excited heart, Zhou Chengshi shared his thoughts with everyone. He said, "In the old society, whenever the landlord's abacus clicked, the laboring people suffered. We toiled year after year, but in the end, it was all for nothing. In years of famine, we even had to sell our children. These 'accounts of exploitation' must be known to the children and taught to them frequently. Today, under Chairman Mao's wise leadership, we live a happy life. These 'accounts of liberation' must also be taught to the children, so they will not forget today's sweetness. In the past, these 'accounts' were not in arithmetic books. Today, we must add them."

Zhou Chengshi also said, "We must teach students addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, but more importantly, we must educate them to never forget class bitterness and to always remember today's sweetness, so they will forever be good students loyal to Chairman Mao."

The old poor peasant Zhou Chengshi's words deeply educated the teachers. Everyone agreed with his views from the bottom of their hearts and linked them to their own thoughts. They fiercely criticized the harm of the revisionist educational line on themselves, raising their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines.

Under the guidance and help of old poor peasant Zhou Chengshi, all the revolutionary teachers at Five Metal Primary School, with one heart, thought about cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause and, with one heart, fought to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line. They quickly compiled arithmetic teaching materials that highlighted Mao Zedong Thought and were relevant to local conditions. Using the new teaching materials, students not only learned arithmetic but also received profound class education. From a young age, students hated the old society, hated the exploiting classes, loved the new society, and loved the great leader Chairman Mao.

　　要算剥削账
    广西玉林县新桥公社五金小学的教师们，在研究算术教材如何进行改革的问题上碰到了困难。有的教师怕犯错误，说是没有经验，主张等上级去改。有的教师则认为：算术算术，加减乘除反正少不了，改不改问题不大。大家意见纷纷，得不出一个结果。
    学校管理委员会副主任、老贫农周承时坐在旁边一边听一边想，越听越感到这种吃“现成饭”和“炒旧饭”的思想不对头。这样下去，学校的教育革命怎能搞彻底，毛主席的无产阶级教育路线怎能得到贯彻。他联想到过去有些高小毕业生，回到生产队不想当会计，更看不起体力劳动，越想越痛恨叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线，越想越感到毛主席“教育要革命”的教导无比英明、无比正确。旧教育制度不彻底改革，贫下中农的后代就会变修，国家就会改变颜色。想到这里，他决心帮助教师们端正态度，搞好算术教学的改革。
    算术教学改革究竟怎么搞才好？
    周承时怀着激动的心情，把自己的想法告诉了大家。他说：“在旧社会，地主的算盘子一响，劳动人民就遭殃，我们长年累月辛辛苦苦地干活，到头来还是竹篮子打水一场空，遇到荒年还得卖儿卖女。这些‘剥削账’要让孩子们知道，教他们经常算。今天，在毛主席的英明领导下，我们过上了幸福生活，这些‘翻身账’，也要教孩子们算，才能不忘今日的甜。过去，这些‘账’算术书上是没有的，今天我们就要添上去。”
    周承时还说：“我们要教学生学加减乘除，但是更重要的是要在思想上教育他们不忘阶级苦，牢记今日甜，永远做忠于毛主席的好学生。”
    老贫农周承时的一席话，深深地教育了教师，大家从内心里赞成他的意见，并联系自己的思想，狠批了修正主义教育路线对自己的毒害，提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟。
    在老贫农周承时的指导、帮助下，五金小学全校革命教师，一心为培养无产阶级革命事业接班人着想，一心为捍卫毛主席的无产阶级教育路线出力，很快地编写出了突出毛泽东思想的、结合当地实际的算术教材。用新教材教学，使学生们既学了算术，又受到了深刻的阶级教育，学生们从幼小的时候起，就仇恨旧社会，仇恨剥削阶级，热爱新社会，热爱伟大领袖毛主席。
