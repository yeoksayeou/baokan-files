The Qindao Railway Bureau Vehicle Section, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great directive to "carry out struggle, criticism, and transformation thoroughly," has closely combined the revolutionary criticism with rectification and the cleansing of the class ranks. This has united the broad masses of Party members and the people, and has struck accurately and fiercely at a handful of class enemies. As a result, the awareness of the struggle between the two lines among Party members and the masses has been raised, and the achievements of the Cultural Revolution have been consolidated.

Before the Cultural Revolution, a handful of traitors, spies, and capitalist-roaders had long been in control of the Vehicle Section, making it impervious to outside influence. The storm of the Cultural Revolution destroyed this capitalist fiefdom, and the power of the Vehicle Section was seized by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. At this time, some people became complacent, thinking: "The situation is stable, it's time to take a breather." The revolutionary criticism also became lax. The military representative and the Revolutionary Committee of the Vehicle Section, in response to this ideological trend, started from class education. They guided the broad revolutionary masses to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest directives: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution under the conditions of socialism, a revolution by which the proletariat seeks to overthrow the bourgeoisie and all other exploiting classes. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its leadership and the broad revolutionary masses of the people on the one hand, and the Kuomintang reactionaries on the other. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." They also held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes according to the active thoughts of the masses. In these study classes, they invited old workers who had suffered deeply to recall their family history and the history of class struggle in the Vehicle Section. This helped the broad masses of Party members and the people to realize that the class struggle in the Vehicle Section is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its leadership and the broad revolutionary masses of the people on the one hand, and the Kuomintang reactionaries on the other. They realized that it is necessary to carry out a thorough and in-depth revolutionary criticism to thoroughly eliminate the poison of the revisionist line that Liu Shaoqi and his agents had promoted in the Vehicle Section, in order to consolidate and develop the newly born Revolutionary Committee and to develop the revolutionary situation.

To ensure that the revolutionary criticism is carried out thoroughly, the Revolutionary Committee focused on two main points:

First, mass participation. They adopted a combination of large, medium, and small criticism meetings, and a combination of criticism meetings for Party members, the masses, and family members, placing the basis of the revolutionary criticism in the work teams. This way, they could make use of all available time, with small meetings, concentrated targets, and opportunities for everyone to speak, fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary workers to participate in the revolutionary criticism and the struggle against the enemy. Every time they held a criticism meeting, they also invited the workers' family members and neighborhood residents to join in, holding struggle meetings together in the section, from the workshop to the dormitory. The revolutionary masses and the class enemies were face to face, and the class enemies became rats crossing the street, with everyone shouting to beat them, and each one in a miserable state.

Second, targeting. They linked the handful of class enemies that had been exposed and their counter-revolutionary crimes with Liu Shaoqi's "six black theories" for criticism. For example, they linked a person who had infiltrated the Party and stolen the position of union chairman, and had slipped through the cracks in every movement, with Liu Shaoqi's "good person party." They linked a person who had infiltrated the Party and was protected and promoted by the capitalist-roaders with Liu Shaoqi's "production party".... In this way, they linked everything from top to bottom and from left to right, making it visible and tangible, concentrating firepower, and criticizing thoroughly.

The thorough revolutionary criticism further exposed the cover of class struggle in the Vehicle Section, making the broad masses of Party members and the people deeply realize that traitors, spies, capitalist-roaders, and landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists are the social base for Liu Shaoqi's restoration of capitalism. Liu Shaoqi is the common backer of these class enemies. This further raised the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines among the broad masses of Party members and the people. Comrade Li Wenrong, a Party member, was initially poisoned by Liu Shaoqi's "tame tool theory" and stood on the opposite side of the rebels during the initial stage of the movement. After the seizure of power, he was also influenced by anarchist thoughts and committed serious errors, losing the trust of Party members and the masses. He was in a state of frustration and was in the position of being "struggled against," working unenthusiastically and not studying hard. Through the revolutionary criticism and class struggle education, he made a comeback and denounced the poisoning of Liu Shaoqi's "tame tool theory" on him. At the struggle-criticism-transformation meeting, he said excitedly: "The reason I took the road of protecting, attacking, and enjoying myself is that I did not listen to Chairman Mao's words and forgot the line of class struggle." There was also an old female worker with 20 years of Party membership who used to think that as long as she worked hard, did not offend anyone, listened to her superiors, and did whatever she was told to do, she could be a good Party member. Through the revolutionary criticism, she realized that this was the poisoning of Liu Shaoqi's "tame tool theory." From then on, she insisted on going to the class to bravely fight against the class enemies every day and was praised by the masses as a good Party member who dared to stand on the front line of the struggle against the enemy.

The broad masses of Party members and the people have raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. The entire section's struggle-criticism-transformation is carried out thoroughly and deeply, and production is booming. The cargo repair workshop's garage construction task was completed six days ahead of schedule. The passenger repair workshop completed the full-year production task two months and four days ahead of schedule.

### 彻底批臭叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇“驯服工具论”等修正主义黑货　青岛铁路分局车辆段紧密结合整党开展革命大批判

　　彻底批臭叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇“驯服工具论”等修正主义黑货
　　青岛铁路分局车辆段紧密结合整党开展革命大批判
    本报讯　青岛铁路分局车辆段遵照毛主席关于“认真搞好斗、批、改”的伟大教导，把大批判和整党、清理阶级队伍紧密地结合起来，团结了广大党员和群众，稳、准、狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人，从而提高了党员和群众两条路线斗争的觉悟，巩固了文化大革命的成果。
    文化大革命以前，一小撮叛徒、特务、走资派长期把持了车辆段的大权，使这个段水泼不进、针插不进。无产阶级文化大革命的风暴，摧毁了这个资产阶级独立王国，由无产阶级革命派掌握了车辆段的大权。这时，有些人就产生了麻痹思想，认为：“大局已定，该歇一歇喘口气了。”革命的大批判也松懈下来。车辆段军代表和革委会针对这一思想苗头，从阶级教育入手，引导广大革命群众反复学习毛主席的最新指示：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”并根据群众中的活思想举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，请苦大仇深的老工人忆家史、忆车辆段的阶级斗争史，使广大党员和群众认识到车辆段的阶级斗争，就是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续。认识到必须全面深入地开展革命大批判，从政治上、思想上彻底肃清刘少奇及其代理人在车辆段所推行的修正主义路线的流毒，才能巩固和发展新生的革命委员会，发展革命的大好形势。于是，全段革命群众个个挥戈上阵，找线索，摆敌情，开展了轰轰烈烈的革命大批判。
    为了使革命大批判深入开展，革委会主要抓了两点：
    一、群众性。采取大中小型批判会相结合，党员、群众和家属批判会相结合的方法，把革命大批判的基点放到班组。这样，可以利用一切可以利用的时间，会小，目标集中，人人可以得到发言的机会，充分调动了广大革命职工参加革命大批判和对敌斗争的积极性。他们每次开批判会，还把职工家属和街道居民请来，在段上一起开批斗会，从车间到宿舍，革命群众和阶级敌人短兵相接，阶级敌人成了过街老鼠，人人喊打，个个狼狈不堪。
    二、针对性。就是把揪出来的一小撮阶级敌人和他们的反革命罪行当成活材料与刘少奇的黑“六论”挂上钩进行批判。例如：把一个混入党内窃取了工会主任职务，在历次运动中滑了过去的所谓“老好人”与刘少奇的“好人党”挂上钩。把混入党内并被走资派包庇拉拢重用的“埋头生产”的坏家伙与刘少奇的“生产党”挂上钩……。这样上下挂钩，左右联系，看得见，摸得着，火力集中，批得狠，批得透。
    轰轰烈烈的革命大批判，进一步揭开了车辆段阶级斗争的盖子，使广大党员、群众深刻地认识到叛徒、特务、走资派和地富反坏右就是刘少奇复辟资本主义的社会基础，刘少奇就是这一小撮阶级敌人的总后台，从而进一步提高了广大党员、群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。共产党员李文荣由于受刘少奇“驯服工具论”的毒害，运动初期站到了造反派的对立面，夺权以后又受了无政府主义思潮的影响，犯了严重错误，失去了党员和群众的信任，他苦闷不安，处于“挨整”的地位，工作不积极，学习不起劲。通过革命大批判和阶级斗争教育，他大杀回马枪，控诉了刘少奇“驯服工具论”对他的毒害，在斗私批修会上，他激动地说：“我所以走上了一保二冲三逍遥的道路，千错万错就错在没有听毛主席的话，忘记了阶级斗争这条纲”。还有位有二十年党龄的女工，过去认为老老实实干活，不得罪人，听上级的话，叫干啥就干啥，就可以做一个好党员。通过革命大批判认识到，这是受了刘少奇“驯服工具论”的毒害，从此，她每天坚持到班上与阶级敌人勇敢战斗，被群众称为敢于站在对敌斗争最前线的好党员。
    广大党员和群众提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，全段斗批改搞得扎实深入，生产蒸蒸日上。货修车间车库修建任务提前六天完成。客修车间提前两个月零四天完成了全年生产任务。
