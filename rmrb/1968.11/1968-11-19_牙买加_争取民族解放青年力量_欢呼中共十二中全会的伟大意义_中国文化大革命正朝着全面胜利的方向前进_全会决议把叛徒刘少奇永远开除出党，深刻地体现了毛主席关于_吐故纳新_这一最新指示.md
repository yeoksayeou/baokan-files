The "Struggle for National Liberation Youth Force" of Jamaica recently issued a statement, enthusiastically hailing the great victory of historic significance achieved by the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

The statement pointed out that this plenary session "has great historic significance for the Chinese revolution and the revolutionary movements of the whole world."

The statement said that since the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people have achieved brilliant victories in their struggle against revisionism. Currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is advancing towards a nationwide, comprehensive victory.

The statement said: "Chairman Mao has steadfastly defended and creatively developed Marxism-Leninism, solving a series of extremely important problems of class struggle in the socialist period. Comrade Mao Zedong is the Lenin of our time."

The statement expressed its resolute support for the various resolutions adopted by the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, stating that "these resolutions are all based on Chairman Mao's correct revolutionary line."

The statement pointed out that the resolution to expel the traitor Liu Shaoqi from the Party permanently and to continue to expose the crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices in betraying the Party and the country "is a great victory for the proletariat over the bourgeoisie, a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought; it is also a great defeat for imperialism led by the United States and for the revisionist running dogs headed by the Soviet ruling clique."

The statement said: "We warmly congratulate the Chinese people and their glorious Communist Party on this great achievement in defending Marxism-Leninism, strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat, and building socialism in China. This resolution most profoundly embodies Chairman Mao's latest directive of 'discarding the old and taking in the new.'"

The statement said: "The communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is indeed a great source of inspiration for all revolutionary parties in the world. This is a brilliant victory for Mao Zedong Thought, the Communist Party of China, and the Chinese people. The Chinese people and the Communist Party of China are now firmly united under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. The Chinese people, armed with Chairman Mao's correct revolutionary line, have no difficulties they cannot overcome; the whole Party and the entire people, united under the call of the expanded Twelfth Plenum, will forge ahead courageously and achieve a thorough and comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."
