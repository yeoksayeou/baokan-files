	Chairman Ho Chi Minh's Proclamation of November 3

	Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 3: According to the Vietnam News Agency, Chairman Ho Chi Minh issued a proclamation on November 3, the full text of which is as follows:

	Fellow countrymen and soldiers!

	In the face of the great victories of our military and people in both the North and the South, especially the great victories achieved in the South since the New Year, on November 1, 1968, the U.S. government was forced to unconditionally stop bombing and attacking the entire territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

	Thus, after four years of extremely heroic struggle, our military and people have achieved glorious victories: shooting down more than 3,200 aircraft, damaging hundreds of large and small ships, and defeating the U.S. imperialists' destructive war in our North.

	This is a victory of great significance to our people's great cause of resisting America and saving the nation.

	The U.S. imperialists mistakenly believed that they could weaken the North, obstruct the support of the rear to the front, and reduce the fighting power of the South with the savage destructive power of their bombs. The fact is: the more the North fights against the American aggressors, the stronger it becomes in all aspects, and it continues to exert all its strength to support the liberation struggle of our heroic southern compatriots. The more the southern compatriots fight against the American aggressors, the more united they become, the stronger their power, and the greater their victories.

	This victory is the victory of our Party's correct revolutionary line, the victory of the strong patriotic spirit and the power of the whole nation's united struggle for decisive victory, and the victory of the fine socialist system. This is the common victory of our military and people in the North and the South. This is also the victory of the peoples of the brotherly countries and our friends from the five continents.

	On this occasion, on behalf of the Party and the government, I warmly commend all our compatriots and soldiers, and express my heartfelt thanks to the great support, sympathy, and assistance of all the socialist brotherly countries, distant and near friends, and the progressive people of the world, including the American people.

	Dear compatriots and soldiers!

	We have defeated the U.S. imperialists' destructive war in the North. But this is only an initial victory. The U.S. imperialists are extremely stubborn and cunning. They talk about "peace" and "negotiations," but they still refuse to give up their aggressive ambitions. More than a million U.S. and puppet troops and mercenary troops still commit countless barbaric crimes against our southern compatriots every day.

	Therefore, the sacred task of all our people at present is to carry forward the spirit of decisive struggle and victory, determined to liberate the South, defend the North, and achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

	As long as there is one aggressor on our soil, we will continue to fight and drive them all out.

	Heroic southern compatriots and soldiers, under the glorious banner of the National Liberation Front, continue to attack, rise up, advance resolutely, and achieve complete victory.

	The military and people of the North are determined to vigorously carry out patriotic emulation, build socialism, and fulfill their duties to our southern compatriots, constantly enhance vigilance, be self-reliant, and strengthen our readiness to fight at any time, and foil all the enemy's new conspiracies.

	We believe that our people's cause of resisting America and saving the nation will continue to receive the great sympathy, support, and assistance of the brotherly countries and the progressive people of the world, including the American people.

	Our people have experienced nearly a hundred years of slave life under colonial rule and more than twenty years of war against imperialist aggression, and we love peace more than anyone else to build our country. But this must be a true peace based on independence and freedom.

	For this reason, we firmly demand:

	—The U.S. government must stop the war of aggression against Vietnam and must forever abandon all actions that infringe upon the sovereignty and security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

	—All U.S. troops and mercenary troops must be withdrawn from South Vietnam.

	—The internal affairs of the South must be resolved by the southern people themselves according to the political program of the National Liberation Front, and foreign countries must not interfere.

	—The cause of reunifying Vietnam must be resolved by the people of the North and the South themselves, and foreign countries must not interfere.

	Dear compatriots and soldiers!

	There are still many hardships and sacrifices ahead of us, but our people's great cause of resisting America and saving the nation is marching towards victory in big strides. The motherland is calling on us to advance bravely and defeat the American aggressors thoroughly.

	The U.S. imperialists will be defeated!

	Our people will be victorious! November 3, 1968

    胡志明主席十一月三日的号召书
    新华社河内三日电　据越南通讯社报道，胡志明主席三日发表了号召书，全文如下：全国同胞和战士们！
    面对着我国南北两方军民的巨大胜利，特别是新春以来在南方所取得的巨大胜利，一九六八年十一月一日，美国政府被迫无条件地停止了对越南民主共和国全部领土的轰炸和袭击。
    这样，我国军民在经过四年无比英勇的战斗后，已经取得了辉煌的胜利：击落三千二百多架飞机，击伤上百艘大小舰艇，打败了美帝国主义在我国北方进行的破坏性战争。
    这是一个对我国人民伟大的抗美救国事业具有十分重要意义的胜利。
    美帝国主义错误地认为，它用炸弹的野蛮的破坏力，就能够削弱北方，阻止大后方对大前方的支援和减弱南方的战斗力。事实是：北方越是进行抗击美国强盗的战斗，在各方面就越是坚强，而且不断地竭尽全力支援英雄的南方同胞的解放斗争。南方同胞越是进行抗击美国强盗的战斗，他们就团结得更紧密，力量更强，胜利更大。
    这一胜利是我党的正确革命路线的胜利，是强烈的爱国精神和全民团结决战决胜威力的胜利，是美好的社会主义制度的胜利。这是我国南北两方军民共同的胜利。这也是各兄弟国家人民和我们的五大洲朋友们的胜利。
    借此机会，我代表党和政府，热烈表彰我全国同胞和战士，并衷心地感谢各社会主义兄弟国家、远近友邦和包括美国进步人民在内的全世界人民的巨大支持、同情和援助。
    亲爱的同胞和战士们！
    我们已经打败美帝国主义在北方进行的破坏性战争。但这只是初步的胜利。美帝国主义是非常顽固和狡猾的。它口谈“和平”、“协商”，但仍不肯放弃自己的侵略野心。一百多万美伪军和帮凶军每天还对我国南方同胞犯下无数的野蛮罪行。
    因此，当前我国全体人民的神圣任务就是，必须发扬决战决胜的精神，决心解放南方，保卫北方，进而和平统一祖国。
    只要在我国土地上还有一个侵略者，我们就要继续战斗，把它全部赶出去。
    英雄的南方同胞和战士们，在民族解放阵线光荣的旗帜下，连续进攻，连续奋起，坚决前进，夺取彻底的胜利。
    北方军民决心努力开展爱国竞赛，建设社会主义和完成自己对骨肉南方同胞的义务，不断提高警惕，自力更生，加强随时准备战斗的力量，粉碎敌人的一切新的阴谋。
    我们相信：我国人民的抗美救国事业，将日益得到各兄弟国家和包括美国进步人民在内的全世界人民的巨大同情、支持和援助。
    我国人民经历了近一百年殖民主义桎梏下的奴隶生活和二十多年反对帝国主义侵略的战争，比任何人都更加热爱和平，以便建设祖国。但这必须是在独立、自由基础上的真正的和平。
    为此，我们坚决要求：
    ——美国政府必须停止侵略越南的战争，必须永远放弃侵犯越南民主共和国主权与安全的一切行动。
    ——必须从越南南方撤出全部美军和帮凶军。
    ——南方的内部事务必须由南方人民根据民族解放阵线的政治纲领自行解决，外国不得干涉。
    ——统一越南的事业，必须由南、北两方人民自行解决，外国不得干涉。
    亲爱的同胞和战士们！
    在我们面前还有许多艰苦和牺牲，但我国人民伟大的抗美救国事业正在大踏步走向胜利。祖国正在召唤我们奋勇前进，彻底打败美国侵略强盗。
    美帝必败！
    我国人民必胜！　一九六八年十一月三日
