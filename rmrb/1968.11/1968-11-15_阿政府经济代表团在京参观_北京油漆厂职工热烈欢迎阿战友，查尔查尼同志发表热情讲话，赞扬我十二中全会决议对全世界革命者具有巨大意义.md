Albanian Government Economic Delegation Visits Beijing
Beijing Paint Factory Workers Warmly Welcome Albanian Comrades; Comrade Qia'erqianni Delivers an Impassioned Speech, Praising the Great Significance of the Decisions of Our Twelfth Plenum for Revolutionaries Worldwide

Xinhua News Agency, November 14th: Comrade Adil Qia'erqianni, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour and Vice Premier of the Albanian Council of Ministers, along with the Albanian government economic delegation he leads, visited and toured the Beijing Paint Factory this morning.

This morning, hundreds of revolutionary workers from the Beijing Paint Factory held high portraits of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, waving the national flags of China and Albania, and beating drums and gongs to warmly welcome the Albanian comrades. Albanian trainees who are practicing at the factory also enthusiastically greeted Comrade Qia'erqianni and others.

Comrade Adil Qia'erqianni delivered an impassioned speech during a discussion with worker representatives. He said, "You are implementing the decisions of the enlarged Twelfth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. This historic decision has great significance not only for China but also for revolutionaries worldwide, and it has great significance for Albania. The Albanian Party of Labour and people enthusiastically support this decision."

Comrade Qia'erqianni said, "The decisions of the enlarged Twelfth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China demonstrate the correctness of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and his series of directives, and demonstrate the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Twelfth Plenum's decision to expel the running dog of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, Liu Shaoqi, from the party forever, not only makes you happy, but also makes us and the people of the world happy. This is a major event of international significance. We firmly believe that China will always remain red."

Comrade Qia'erqianni said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great movement personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao. Revolutionaries around the world regard the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China not only as a victory for the Chinese people but also as a victory for the world communist movement. We sincerely wish Chairman Mao longevity! Longevity!"

The Albanian comrades listened to the responsible comrade of the revolutionary committee of the paint factory introduce the situation of the entire factory's workers responding to Chairman Mao's great call, conducting struggle, criticism, and transformation seriously, and promoting production during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They toured the hot melting, power, and nitrocellulose workshops. After the tour, the old worker representatives presented a banner they personally embroidered with the words "Long Live Sino-Albanian Friendship" to the Albanian comrades. At this moment, the Chinese and Albanian comrades present shouted, "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"

Comrade Xu Jinqiang, Acting Minister of the Chemical Industry of our country, accompanied the Albanian comrades to visit the paint factory.

　　阿政府经济代表团在京参观
　　北京油漆厂职工热烈欢迎阿战友，查尔查尼同志发表热情讲话，赞扬我十二中全会决议对全世界革命者具有巨大意义
    新华社十四日讯　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、阿尔巴尼亚部长会议副主席阿迪尔·查尔查尼同志，和由他率领的阿尔巴尼亚政府经济代表团，今天上午参观访问了北京市油漆厂。
    今天上午，北京市油漆厂数百名革命职工，高举中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的画像和阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志的画像，挥动着中、阿两国国旗，敲锣打鼓，热烈欢迎阿尔巴尼亚战友。在油漆厂实习的阿尔巴尼亚实习生也热烈迎接查尔查尼等同志。
    阿迪尔·查尔查尼同志在同工人代表座谈时发表了热情洋溢的讲话。他说，你们正在贯彻执行中国共产党八届扩大的十二中全会的决议，这个历史性的决议，不仅对中国而且对全世界革命者具有巨大意义，对阿尔巴尼亚也具有巨大意义，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和人民热烈支持这个决议。
    查尔查尼同志说，中国共产党八届扩大的十二中全会的决议，说明了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和毛主席一系列指示的正确性，说明了无产阶级文化大革命的胜利。十二中全会通过决议，把帝国主义、现代修正主义和国民党反动派的走狗刘少奇永远开除出党，不仅使你们高兴，我们和全世界人民都高兴，这是具有国际意义的重大事情。我们坚信，中国将永远保持鲜红的颜色。
    查尔查尼同志说，无产阶级文化大革命是伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的伟大运动。世界革命者把中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，不仅看成中国人民的胜利，而且看成世界共产主义运动的胜利。我们衷心祝福毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    阿尔巴尼亚战友听取油漆厂革命委员会负责人介绍了全厂工人响应毛主席伟大号召，在无产阶级文化大革命中认真进行斗、批、改和抓革命、促生产的情况，参观了热炼、动力和硝基等车间。参观后，工厂老工人代表把他们亲手绣制的有“中阿友谊万岁”字样的锦旗赠送给阿尔巴尼亚战友。这时，在场的中、阿同志高呼：“恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”
    我国化工部代理部长徐今强，陪同阿尔巴尼亚战友参观了油漆厂。
