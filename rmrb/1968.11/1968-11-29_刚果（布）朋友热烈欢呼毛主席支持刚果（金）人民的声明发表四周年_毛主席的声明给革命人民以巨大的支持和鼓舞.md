	Congolese (Brazzaville) friends warmly celebrate the fourth anniversary of the great teacher Chairman Mao's "Statement in Support of the Congolese (Leopoldville) People's Struggle Against U.S. Aggression."

	Chairman Mao's statement has given great support and encouragement to the Congolese people and all revolutionaries around the world. Four years later, this statement still has great practical significance.

	One Congolese (Brazzaville) friend named Mongongo told a Xinhua News Agency reporter that Chairman Mao Zedong's great statement is a document of great political significance in Marxism-Leninism. It has given great support and encouragement to the Congolese people and all revolutionaries around the world. Four years later, this statement still has great practical significance.

	He emphasized that today, we must raise the banner of struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism even higher, and respond to Chairman Mao's great call in the statement: "All the people of the world, unite and defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! The people of the world must dare to struggle, must not fear sacrifices, and must advance wave upon wave. Then the whole world will belong to the people. All the ghosts and monsters will be swept away."

	Another friend named Paul said: Chairman Mao's statement not only supports the Congolese (Kinshasa) people in their struggle against U.S. imperialism's aggression but also calls on the peoples of Africa, Asia, and Latin America to struggle against U.S. imperialism's aggression. We have always regarded this statement as the revolutionary line for the peoples of Africa, Asia, and Latin America to struggle against old and new colonialism, imperialism, and modern revisionism.

	He said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of the whole world." U.S. imperialism and its puppets in the Congo (Kinshasa) have always wanted to turn the Congo (Kinshasa) into a new type of colony and a military base for invading Africa, like Israel in the Middle East. The establishment of the so-called "Central African States Alliance" with the Congolese (Kinshasa) puppet group as its head is a typical example of U.S. imperialism's plot to control Africa.

	Paul pointed out: U.S. imperialism is also constantly expanding its aggression in various places in Asia and Latin America, suppressing national liberation movements. But the day when they are hanged by the revolutionary peoples of the whole world will surely come.

	Finally, these two Congolese (Brazzaville) friends enthusiastically shouted: Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!

    刚果（布）朋友热烈欢呼毛主席支持刚果（金）人民的声明发表四周年
    毛主席的声明给革命人民以巨大的支持和鼓舞
    决心响应毛主席在声明中所发出的伟大号召更高地举起反帝反殖斗争红旗
    新华社布拉柴维尔二十七日电　刚果（布）朋友热烈欢呼伟大导师毛主席《支持刚果（利）人民反对美国侵略的声明》发表四周年。
    一位名叫蒙蒙乔的刚果（布）朋友对新华社记者说，毛泽东主席的这个伟大声明，是具有重大政治意义的马克思列宁主义文献，它给了刚果人民和世界上所有的革命者以巨大的支持和鼓舞。在四年后的今天，这一声明仍然具有巨大的现实意义。
    他强调指出，今天，我们要更高地举起反对帝国主义、反对新老殖民主义的斗争红旗，响应毛主席在声明中所发出的伟大的号召：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”
    另一位名叫保罗的朋友说：毛主席的声明不仅支持刚果（金）人民反对美帝国主义的侵略，而且也是号召非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲各国人民反对美帝国主义的侵略。我们过去和现在都把这一声明看作是非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲各国人民同新老殖民主义、帝国主义、现代修正主义作斗争的革命的总路线。
    他说，毛主席教导我们：“美帝国主义是全世界人民的共同敌人。”美帝国主义及其在刚果（金）的傀儡，一直想把刚果（金）变成象中东的以色列那样的新型殖民地和侵略非洲的军事基地。建立以刚果（金）傀儡集团为首的所谓“中非国家联盟”，就是美帝国主义阴谋控制非洲的一个典型例子。
    保罗指出：美帝国主义也在亚洲和拉丁美洲各地不断扩大侵略，镇压民族解放运动。但是，他们被全世界革命人民处以绞刑的那一天必将到来。
    最后，这两位刚果（布）朋友热情高呼：伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！
