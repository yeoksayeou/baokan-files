The imperialists of the United States are militarily tightening their control over Indonesia and blatantly establishing military bases in Indonesia to invade Asia.

According to foreign news agencies and newspapers, as the fascist military regime in Indonesia becomes increasingly pro-American, the imperialists of the United States have already established three military bases in Indonesia. They are located in the strategically important areas of North Sumatra's Siau, North Sulawesi's Bitung, and Central Java's Cilacap. It is reported that the base in Siau is part of a series of U.S. bases in Thailand, "and thus has been included in the system of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization." According to the October issue of the Jakarta-based "Lampu Merah" Weekly, an organization called the "U.S.-Indonesia Defense Liaison Group" is engaged in counter-revolutionary activities in Indonesia.

In recent months, the military collusion between the imperialists of the United States and the fascist military regime in Indonesia has been extremely frequent. According to the Antara News Agency, in July this year, the U.S. military attaché at the U.S. Embassy in Indonesia "visited" the commander of the Indonesian fascist military regime's army, Panggabean, and other reactionary leaders of the Indonesian fascist army. Soon after, three U.S. military officers went to Central Java, where they held secret talks with local reactionary military authorities and "visited" the U.S. military base at the port of Cilacap in Central Java. According to the Antara News Agency, on the same day these three U.S. military officers arrived, a U.S. military plane landed at the airport in Semarang, the capital of Central Java. In August, the assistant military attaché of the U.S. Embassy in Indonesia and the assistant naval attaché, escorted by the reactionary military authorities in Indonesia, went to Central Java for conspiratorial activities. In September, the U.S. military attaché, accompanied by reactionary military leaders in Indonesia, "visited some military targets" in South Malang, East Java, and "participated in anti-aircraft exercises."

At the same time, the United States recently "invited" some leaders of the Indonesian fascist army to the United States for activities. It is reported that a delegation from the Indonesian Army, composed of reactionary generals and officers such as Dasono, the commander of the West Java Siliwangi Division, spent more than forty days in the United States. During their stay in the United States, this delegation held a series of secret talks with the U.S. Secretary of Defense and other military leaders, plotting new anti-communist conspiracies. This delegation shamelessly admitted that the Indonesian fascist military regime's mad implementation of anti-communist, anti-Chinese, and anti-people counter-revolutionary policies has received "full affirmation" from their American masters. According to the Antara News Agency, under the "U.S. Military Training Assistance Plan," batches of reactionary officers from the Indonesian Army, Navy, and Air Force have recently been continuously sent to the United States to receive various military trainings.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out that the U.S. military bases in foreign countries "are nooses around the neck of U.S. imperialism." The imperialists of the United States, in collusion with the fascist military regime in Indonesia, have established military bases in this archipelago nation, attempting to suppress the revolutionary movements of the people in Indonesia and other countries and regions in Asia. This has put another noose around their necks. The people of Indonesia, who have taken up arms for revolution, are tightly gripping the other end of the noose. One day, they will, together with the revolutionary people of the world, strangle U.S. imperialism to death!

### 加紧控制印度尼西亚　妄图镇压亚洲人民革命运动  美帝在印尼建立军事基地

    加紧控制印度尼西亚　妄图镇压亚洲人民革命运动
    美帝在印尼建立军事基地
    新华社一日讯　雅加达消息：美帝国主义正在军事上加紧控制印度尼西亚，并公然在印尼建立了侵略亚洲的军事基地。
    据外国通讯社和报纸透露，随着印尼法西斯军人政权变本加厉地实行卖国政策，美帝国主义已经在印尼建立了三个军事基地。它们分别设在具有战略意义的北苏门答腊的沙璜、北苏拉威西的比东和中爪哇的芝拉扎。消息说，美国在沙璜建立的基地属于美国在泰国的一系列基地的“环节”，“因此，已经包括在东南亚条约组织的体系内”。据雅加达《明灯周报》十月中旬透露，一个叫做“美国—印尼防务联络代表团”正在印尼从事反革命活动。
    几个月来，美帝国主义同印尼法西斯军人政权的军事勾结极为频繁。据安塔拉通讯社透露，今年七月，美国驻印尼大使馆武官“拜访”了印尼法西斯军人政权陆军司令庞加贝安和印尼法西斯军队的其他一些反动头目。随后不久，三个美国军官到中爪哇活动，同当地反动军事当局进行了密谈，并“参观”了美国在中爪哇的军事基地芝拉扎港口。据安塔拉通讯社的消息说，在这三个美国军官到达的同一天，一架美国军用飞机在中爪哇首府三宝垄机场着陆。八月，美国驻印尼大使馆的陆军武官和海军武官的助理在印尼反动军事当局的护送下到中爪哇进行阴谋活动。九月，美国武官在印尼反动军事头目的陪同下，到东爪哇“参观了玛琅南部的一些军事目标”和“防空演习”。
    与此同时，美国最近还“邀请”印尼法西斯军队的一些头目到美国活动。据透露，由西爪哇西利万吉师师长达索诺等反动将领和军官组成的印尼陆军代表团，前些时候到美国活动了四十多天。在美国期间，这个代表团曾同美国国防部长及其他军事头目进行了一系列密谈，策划新的反共阴谋。这个代表团无耻地供认，印尼法西斯军人政权疯狂推行反共、反华、反人民的反革命政策，博得了美国主子的“充分肯定”。据安塔拉通讯社透露，根据“美国军事训练援助计划”，一批又一批的印尼陆、海、空军的反动军官最近络绎不绝地被派往美国接受各种军事训练。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席早就指出，美国在外国的军事基地，“都是套在美帝国主义脖子上的绞索”。美帝国主义勾结印尼法西斯军人政权在这个千岛之国上建立军事基地，妄图镇压印尼和亚洲其他国家和地区的人民革命运动，这就在它的脖子上套上了新的绞索。已经走上武装革命道路的印度尼西亚人民，正在把绞索的另一端紧紧地握在手里，他们终有一天会同全世界革命人民一起，把美帝国主义绞死！
