The Sri Lankan Communist Party's *Red Flag* Weekly today published an editorial, enthusiastically hailing the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

The editorial points out that this communiqué is an extremely important document. The communiqué marks an important stage in the development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

"The communiqué marks the defense and consolidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat in China. China is the base of world revolution. It also marks the complete failure of the reactionary revisionist forces led by Liu Shaoqi in their attempt to restore capitalism in China, which has already occurred in the Soviet Union and in other countries ruled by modern revisionists."

The editorial points out, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has been able to achieve these victories because it has the wise and personal leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. This is a victory for contemporary Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought."

The editorial says, "The progressive revolutionary movements of the whole world hail these victories as their own and are further inspired and encouraged to carry out revolutionary activities in their own countries."

The editorial stresses, "Comrade Mao Zedong has brilliantly shown the Chinese people how to advance the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is an important lesson for all revolutionaries in countries now ruled by modern revisionists."

The editorial mentions that through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, China has become even stronger. The Chinese people have further strengthened their unity on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. The educational revolution led by the working class has begun, and a great industrial revolution is also underway.

The editorial says, "All revolutionaries hail these victories and hail the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party."

　　锡兰共产党《红旗》周刊欢呼中共十二中全会公报标志着
　　中国的无产阶级专政得到捍卫和巩固
　　妄图在中国复辟资本主义的以刘少奇为首的修正主义反动势力彻底失败
    新华社科伦坡十九日电　锡兰共产党《红旗》周刊今天发表社论，热烈欢呼中国共产党第八届扩大的十二中全会的公报。
    社论指出，这个公报是一个极其重要的文献。公报标志着中国的无产阶级文化大革命发展的一个重要阶段。
    “公报标志着中国的无产阶级专政得到了捍卫和巩固，中国是世界革命的基地。它同时标志着妄图在中国实现资本主义复辟的以刘少奇为首的修正主义反动势力的彻底失败，而这种复辟在苏联和现代修正主义者统治的其他国家已经发生了。”
    社论指出，“无产阶级文化大革命能够取得这些胜利，是因为无产阶级文化大革命有当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志的英明的和亲自的领导。这是当代的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想的胜利。”
    社论说，“全世界的进步革命运动把这些胜利当作他们自己的胜利来欢呼，并且受到进一步的鼓舞和激励，从而在本国展开革命活动。”
    社论强调说，“毛泽东同志天才地向中国人民指出了怎样在无产阶级专政条件下把革命推向前进。这是对现在被现代修正主义者统治的一切国家里的革命者的重要教益。”
    社论谈到中国通过无产阶级文化大革命变得更加强大，中国人民在毛泽东思想基础上进一步增强了团结，由工人阶级领导的教育革命已经开始，一场巨大的工业革命也在进行中。
    社论说，“一切革命者都欢呼这些胜利，都欢呼中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会的公报。”
