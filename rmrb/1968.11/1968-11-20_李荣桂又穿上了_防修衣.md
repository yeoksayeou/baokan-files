Li Ronggui is a student who recently entered the Qingxianshuang Agricultural Middle School in Hebei's Ding County. Ever since she arrived, she had been wearing a patched and mended old jacket. However, not long ago, she stopped wearing it. Was the jacket dirty? No.

What was the reason then? It turns out that before she entered the school, her mother specially patched up an old jacket that had been worn by several generations and gave it to her, telling her not to forget the past hardships and to always remember the essence of the laboring people. However, after entering the school, some classmates always looked at her jacket, and she developed incorrect thoughts. She thought, "A seventeen or eighteen-year-old girl wearing a jacket full of patches is too shabby," so she packed it away in a small bag.

Li Ronggui's act of changing her clothes was soon discovered by the poor peasant community member Han Fuguang, who was in charge of managing the school. He thought: What kind of attire to wear reflects the struggle between two lines of thought and two paths. The jacket Li packed away in her small bag was not just a piece of old clothing, but the spirit of hard work and simplicity of the proletariat and the essence of the laboring people. This is the poison of the revisionist thought that the traitor Liu Shaoqi promoted, affecting the younger generation! Therefore, Han Fuguang immediately found Li Ronggui and had a heart-to-heart talk with her, recalling the bitterness of the past and the sweetness of the present.

Chairman Mao taught us: "Class struggle, once grasped, is all-powerful." When Han Fuguang talked to Li Ronggui about how he had nothing to eat or wear in the old society and how he had to wear a broken straw mat to keep warm in a small temple during the cold winter months, Li Ronggui couldn't help but think of her own family's tragic past. At that time, her parents also relied on this jacket to go out begging for food in the heavy snow during the day and to keep warm at night. This jacket was filled with the blood and tears of the poor people, filled with the deep hatred of the poor people towards the old society. But now she had packed it away in a small bag, wasn't this forgetting the blood and tears of the poor people and forgetting the exploitation they suffered in the old society? Thinking of this, Li Ronggui shed tears, and she regretfully said to Han Fuguang, "Uncle Han, I was wrong. I shouldn't have forgotten the hardships and blood of the laboring people in the old society."

"Yes, it's good that you can recognize your mistake, but you should also see the root of this mistaken thought," Han Fuguang said, seeing that Li Ronggui had a deep understanding of her mistaken thought. "Think about it, the traitor Liu Shaoqi isn't using the revisionist educational line to poison us and using the bourgeoisie's methods to corrupt us? He wants to make our thoughts rusty, let the bourgeoisie's filth spread, and realize his dream of restoring capitalism." Han Fuguang's words hit Li Ronggui's heart, and she raised her fist in anger, denouncing the traitor Liu Shaoqi's poisoning of her.

From that day on, Li Ronggui put on the jacket full of patches again. She said, "This is to maintain the essence of the poor people, to prevent the infiltration of bourgeois thought. It is my 'anti-revisionist clothes,' and I will wear it for life."

　　李荣桂又穿上了“防修衣”
    李荣桂是刚进河北定县清松店农中的学生。入校来，她一直穿着那件补了又补、缝了又缝的旧衣服，可是不久以前，缝补过的衣服突然不穿了。是那件衣服脏了吗？不是。
    是什么原因呢？原来她入校前，妈妈特地把穿了几代的旧衣服补了补交给她，要她不忘过去苦，永记劳动人民的本色。可是，入校以后，有些同学老是看她的衣服，她就产生了不正确的想法。她想，十七、八岁的姑娘，穿一件补钉摞补钉的衣服，太寒酸了，所以便把它打进了小包。
    李荣桂换穿衣服这件事，不久被参加管理学校的贫农社员韩富全发现了。他想：要什么样的穿戴，这是两种思想、两条路线的斗争的反映。小李打进小包里的不只是件破衣服，而是无产阶级艰苦朴素的作风和劳动人民的本色。这是叛徒刘少奇推行的修正主义思想的毒素对后一代的影响啊！于是，韩富全立即找到李荣桂，和她一块谈心，一块忆苦思甜。
    毛主席教导我们：“阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”当韩富全向李荣桂谈了自己在旧社会没吃、没穿，十冬腊月披张破麻袋在小庙里过冬时，李荣桂也不禁想起了自己家里悲惨的过去。那时她的父母也是在大雪纷飞的冬季，白天靠着这衣服外出要饭，夜晚靠着这衣服取暖露宿。这一件衣服，写满了穷苦人民的血泪，写满了穷苦人民对旧社会的无比愤怒。可是现在自己把它打进了小包里，这不是忘记穷苦人民的血泪，忘了旧社会受的剥削？想到这里，李荣桂流下了泪水，她十分悔恨地对韩富全说：“韩大伯，是我错了，我不该忘了旧社会劳动人民的苦难和血泪。”
    “是啊，你能认识到自己错误这很好，但是更应该看到产生这种错误思想的根源哪。”韩富全见李荣桂对自己的错误思想有较深刻的认识，又接着说：“你想想，叛徒刘少奇不是用修正主义教育路线毒害我们，用资产阶级的一套腐蚀我们吗？他就是妄想让我们在思想上长锈，使资产阶级的臭东西泛滥成灾，实现他复辟资本主义的迷梦。”韩富全的话打中李荣桂思想深处，她举起拳头愤怒地控诉了叛徒刘少奇对自己的毒害。
    从那以后，李荣桂又穿起了这件补钉摞补钉的旧衣服，她说：“这是保持穷苦人民的本色，防止资产阶级思想侵蚀的‘防修衣’，我要穿它一辈子。”　向阳兵
