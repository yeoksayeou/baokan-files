Shandong's revolutionary committees at various levels are establishing extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes to swiftly implement and carry out the various combat tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee. Currently, Mao Zedong Thought study classes based on the plenary session's communique have sprung up like mushrooms after rain throughout the province. In the Tai'an region alone, over 40,000 such classes have been established. Revolutionary cadres and masses participating in these classes have, through serious study, unanimously recognized that the communique is the most scientific, profound, and comprehensive summary of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past two years. It is a great guideline for leading the people of the entire nation to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. They must, with the fastest speed, the highest enthusiasm, and the greatest determination, launch a tide of extensive study, propaganda, and implementation.

Many study classes, while studying the plenary session's communique, have linked it to the actual situations in their regions and departments, summarized and reviewed their work, identified gaps, and formulated measures. They have swiftly launched a new high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

Units in Jinan and Qingdao have used the study classes as battlefields and the communique of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee as a sharp weapon to continue the revolutionary criticism of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi. The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team and the revolutionary committee of the 16th Middle School in Jinan led the entire school's revolutionary teachers and students to examine the situation and identify gaps in light of the spirit of the communique. Through study, everyone recognized that, under the guidance of Mao Zedong's revolutionary line, although significant achievements had been made in the school's work in the previous period, there were also some shortcomings, mainly that the revolutionary criticism was not tight enough and there was a tendency to relax in the struggle against the enemy. Subsequently, the broad revolutionary teachers and students ignited the flames of revolutionary criticism, fiercely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's advocacy of the "theory of the extinction of class struggle," and further carried out the work of purging the class ranks.

The revolutionary masses of the Qingdao People's Hospital displayed the special wards and equipment that the hospital's capitalist-roaders had set up according to the instructions of their black master Liu Shaoqi for a few "masters" as negative teaching materials. They deeply criticized Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes of attempting to restore capitalism, giving the broad revolutionary masses a profound education in class struggle and the struggle between the two lines.

The revolutionary committees and masses at various levels in Heze and Linyi have, while studying in the classes, summarized and reviewed their work, formulated measures, and powerfully promoted the development of various tasks. The responsible comrades of the Chengwu County Revolutionary Committee compared their county's work with advanced units like Dongming County, identifying gaps such as some leading comrades not deeply entering the grassroots, not closely linking with the masses, and not sufficiently listening to the masses' opinions. In response to this situation, they formulated improvement measures, deciding to immediately and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instructions on conducting revolutionary criticism, streamlining organizations, sending cadres to labor, and reforming unreasonable regulations, making the revolutionary committee truly a revolutionary and closely linked with the masses combat command center. In the Mao Zedong Thought study classes held by the revolutionary committees of Yishan, Fei County, and Yishui, some revolutionary leading cadres who stood out used the communique as a mirror to examine and criticize their own "fear-first" and "self-first" erroneous thoughts in their work, determined to vigorously promote ideological revolutionization and achieve new merits for the people in completing the various combat tasks proposed by the plenary session. Some representatives of revolutionary mass organizations that had implemented the "three-in-one combination" examined the emerging arrogance and self-satisfaction in their thoughts, determined to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, remain humble and cautious, closely link with the masses, and strive to realize the various combat calls issued by the plenary session. Subsequently, they adopted the method of combining internal and external classes, focusing on both their own ideological revolutionization and the propaganda and implementation of the communique, promoting each other between internal and external classes, and swiftly launching a new high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

Through the establishment of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, Shandong has played a significant role in swiftly implementing the various combat tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee. The East Machine Factory of the Dongfanghong Mine in Zibo had some leadership members who were not united, leading to signs of "internal warfare" among the masses. In the study classes, these leadership members seriously studied the communique, examined their thoughts, carried out criticism and self-criticism, and unified their thoughts with Mao Zedong Thought, swiftly resolving the issue of lack of unity and further consolidating the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." The broad revolutionary workers of this mine bureau, with the communique as a great driving force, fully played the leading role of the working class, vigorously promoted the revolution, and vigorously promoted production. In recent days, they have produced an additional 3,000 tons of raw coal for the state each day. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants in many regions, inspired by the communique, have launched a tide of enthusiastically delivering autumn grain, cotton, and oil to the state. The amount of autumn grain purchased in the Jining region has increased by over 400,000 jin per day since the communique was issued. The regions of Qufu, Yanzhou, Zoucheng, Tengxian, and Jining City in this region have all completed their annual grain procurement tasks.

    山东各级革委会大办毛泽东思想学习班
    坚决执行全会提出的各项伟大战斗任务
    新华社济南八日电　山东省各级革命委员会大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，迅速贯彻、落实党的八届扩大的十二中全会提出的各项战斗任务。目前，在全省各地以全会公报为基本学习内容的毛泽东思想学习班已如雨后春笋纷纷举办起来，仅泰安地区，这样的学习班就办了四万多个。参加学习班的广大革命群众和革命干部通过认真学习，一致认识到，全会公报是对两年多来无产阶级文化大革命最科学、最精辟、最完整的总结，是指导全国人民将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的伟大纲领，一定要以最快的速度，最高的热情，最大的决心掀起大学习、大宣传、大落实的热潮。许多学习班在学习全会公报时，都联系本地区、本部门的实际，总结检查工作，找差距，订措施，很快掀起了斗、批、改的新高潮。
    济南、青岛等地的许多单位，以学习班为战场，以党的八届十二中全会公报为锐利武器，对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇继续展开了革命大批判。驻济南十六中的工人毛泽东思想宣传队和校革委会，带领全校革命师生对照公报精神，查敌情，找差距。通过学习大家认识到，在毛主席革命路线指引下，校内前段工作虽然取得了很大成绩，但也有些不足之处，主要的是对革命大批判抓得不够紧，对敌斗争有松口气的思想。接着，广大革命师生就把革命大批判的烈火猛烈燃烧起来，狠批了刘少奇鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，进一步开展了清理阶级队伍的工作。青岛人民医院的革命群众，把这个医院的党内走资派当年按照他的黑主子刘少奇的旨意，为少数“老爷”专设的病房、用具，照原样摆出来作为反面教材，深入批判刘少奇妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行，使广大革命群众受到了极为深刻的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争教育。
    菏泽、临沂等地的各级革委会成员和革命群众，在学习班里一边学习公报，一边总结检查工作，制订措施，有力地推动了各项工作的开展。成武县革委会负责同志对比东明县等先进单位，找出了本县工作中的差距。如：某些领导成员深入基层差，联系群众差，听取群众意见不够。针对这种情况，他们订出了改进措施，决定立即雷厉风行地贯彻执行毛主席关于进行革命大批判、精简机构、干部下放劳动、改革不合理的规章制度等指示，使革委会真正成为革命化的密切联系群众的战斗指挥部。在沂源、费县、沂水等县革委会举办的毛泽东思想学习班上，一些站出来的革命领导干部以公报为镜子，对照检查了自己在工作中“怕”字当头，资产阶级的“私”字领先的错误思想，决心狠抓思想革命化，在完成全会提出的各项战斗任务中，为人民立新功。一些参加了革命“三结合”的革命群众组织的代表，检查了在思想上开始滋长的骄傲自满情绪，决心遵照毛主席的教导，戒骄戒躁，密切联系群众，为实现全会发出的各项战斗号召而奋斗。接着，他们就采取班内班外相结合的办法，既抓自身的思想革命化，又抓宣传、落实公报的工作，班内班外相互促进，迅速掀起了斗、批、改新高潮。
    山东各地通过大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，对迅速落实党的八届十二中全会提出的各项战斗任务，起到了很大的推动作用。淄博矿务局东方红总厂东机二厂，由于少数领导成员不够团结，致使群众中出现打“内战”的苗头。在学习班上，这些领导成员认真学习公报，检查自己的思想，开展批评与自我批评，用毛泽东思想统一认识，很快解决了不团结的问题，进一步巩固了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。这个矿务局的广大革命职工还以公报为巨大动力，充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，狠抓革命，猛促生产，最近几天，每天都为国家多生产三千多吨原煤。许多地区的广大贫下中农在公报的鼓舞下，掀起了踊跃向国家交售秋粮、棉花、油料的热潮。济宁地区的秋粮收购量，在公报发表后每天增加四百多万斤。这个地区的曲阜、兖州、邹县、滕县和济宁市等都已完成了全年粮食征购任务。
