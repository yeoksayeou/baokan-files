The Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) warmly congratulates the success of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the CPC.

The victory of the Chinese people is a powerful support for the revolutionary people of the world.

Under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, hundreds of millions of people have smashed the bourgeois headquarters represented by the traitor Liu Shaoqi, consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat, and dealt a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism.

New China News Agency, November 7th: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China received a congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) on November 2nd, congratulating the successful convening of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Enlarged Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

Central Committee of the Communist Party of China:

The Italian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) warmly congratulates the convening of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Enlarged Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

The 12th Plenary Session marks a new historical period in the development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, initiated and led personally by Chairman Mao Zedong, is a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship in China.

Practice has proved, as Chairman Mao Zedong has emphasized, that this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is completely necessary for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist restoration, and building socialism.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Lin Biao, this class struggle has mobilized hundreds of millions of people in an unprecedentedly broad and deep manner, smashing the bourgeois headquarters represented by the traitor, spy, imperialist, and modern revisionist running dog of the Kuomintang reactionaries, Liu Shaoqi, who attempted to usurp the Party and the government and restore capitalism in China.

Today, the red flag of the revolutionary committees is flying high across China, proclaiming a great victory, a decisive victory. This great victory has been achieved because the broad revolutionary masses are increasingly mastering the contemporary Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought.

This victory is a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism and its number one accomplice, the Soviet revisionist leadership group, which are colluding to divide the world into spheres of influence.

This victory is a powerful support for the people and revolutionaries of all countries who are fighting against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries.

Our era is one in which imperialism and modern revisionism, beset by insurmountable contradictions, are heading towards comprehensive failure, and socialism is heading towards global victory.

Our era is the great era of Mao Zedong Thought.

The Italian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) draws new strength from the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to apply Mao Zedong Thought to the concrete realities of Italy, to carry out the struggle led by the proletariat and the people against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, to strive for the establishment of proletarian dictatorship and the achievement of socialism.

Long live the Chinese people and their glorious Communist Party led by Comrade Mao Zedong!

Long live the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Long live proletarian internationalism!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist)
Rome, November 2, 1968

    意共（马列）中央热烈祝贺中共八届十二中全会成功
    中国人民的胜利是对世界革命人民的强有力支持
    亿万群众在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部领导下，摧毁了叛徒刘少奇为代表的资产阶级司令部，巩固了无产阶级专政，最沉重地打击了美帝苏修
    新华社七日讯　中国共产党中央委员会收到了意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义）中央委员会二日发来的贺电，贺电热烈祝贺中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会的成功。贺电全文如下：中国共产党中央委员会：
    意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义）热烈祝贺中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全体会议的召开。
    十二中全会标志着无产阶级文化大革命发展到一个新的历史时期。毛泽东主席亲自发动和亲自领导的无产阶级文化大革命是在中国无产阶级专政的条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命。
    实践证明，正如毛泽东主席所强调的，这次无产阶级文化大革命，对于巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义，是完全必要的。
    在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，在以毛泽东同志为首、林彪同志为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下，在这场阶级斗争中，空前广泛、深入地发动了亿万群众，摧毁了以内奸、叛徒、帝国主义和现代修正主义及国民党反动派的走狗刘少奇为代表的妄图篡党、篡政和在中国复辟资本主义的资产阶级司令部。
    今天，革命委员会的红旗正在全中国飘扬，宣告取得了一个伟大的胜利，一个决定性的胜利。这一伟大胜利所以能够取得，是因为广大革命群众日益掌握了当代的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想。
    这一胜利对以美国为首的帝国主义及其头号帮凶——以苏联修正主义领导集团为中心的现代修正主义——是一次最沉重的打击。它们相互勾结划分世界势力范围。
    这一胜利对全世界正在进行反对帝国主义、反对修正主义和反动派的斗争的各国人民和革命者是一个强有力的支持。
    我们的时代是被不可克服的矛盾所困住的帝国主义和现代修正主义日益彻底走向全面失败、社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代。
    我们的时代是毛泽东思想的伟大时代。
    意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义）从无产阶级文化大革命的胜利中吸取了新的力量，以便把毛泽东思想运用到意大利的具体实际中，开展以无产阶级和人民群众为首的反对帝国主义、反对修正主义和反动派，争取建立无产阶级专政和争取社会主义的斗争。
    中国人民及其以毛泽东同志为首的光荣的共产党万岁！
    无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁！
    无产阶级国际主义万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
        意大利共产党（马克思列宁主义）中央委员会
