In the construction of the aviation industry, there has always been a struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads. The focus of this struggle has always been on the issue of power: whether the working class leads everything or the bourgeoisie leads everything; whether to adhere to the mass line or to implement “expert management.” This is a crucial issue of who the aviation industry relies on for construction, which class holds power, serves which class, and which road to take.

As early as 1926, Chairman Mao pointed out: “The industrial proletariat is the leading force of our revolution.” On the eve of national victory, at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, Chairman Mao again instructed: “We must wholeheartedly rely on the working class.” At the beginning of the establishment of the aviation industry, the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao dispatched a large number of veteran workers, soldiers of the People’s Liberation Army, and outstanding cadres to strengthen the workforce of the aviation industry, ensuring that the leadership was in the hands of the working class. However, at this very moment, the traitor Liu Shaoqi viciously said: “The working class may not be reliable at certain times.” So, who does he want to rely on? Not relying on the working class means relying on the bourgeoisie. Indeed, the traitor Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the aviation industry, under the guise of “returning to the ranks,” recruited a large number of bourgeois technical “authorities” and remnants of the Kuomintang to fiercely compete with the working class for the leadership of the aviation industry.

The traitor Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the aviation industry, in order to deny the leading position of the working class and to implement bourgeois “expert management,” fabricated various counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies that must be thoroughly criticized.

“There should be some people with engineering backgrounds to be factory directors,” “Workers lack knowledge and cannot solve problems.” This is the blatant counter-revolutionary propaganda they created to seize power for the bourgeoisie. A small clique of capitalist-roaders in the aviation industry, following the instructions of the traitor Liu Shaoqi, openly advocated, “In production and technology, we must rely on experts.” Under their protection, these reactionary “authorities” were promoted one after another, and some were even brought into the Party.

To elevate these bourgeois reactionary “authorities” to the heavens, they viciously slandered workers as lacking knowledge and being unable to solve problems. In reality, the bourgeois “authorities” only have knowledge of oppressing workers, controlling workers, and running capitalist enterprises. In the enterprise, the true knowledge and the true solvers of major problems are the worker masses. There was a product that encountered a technical bottleneck. At that time, the bourgeois “authorities” were at a loss and hastily brought out regulations from foreign books, saying, “It must use the hide from the buttocks of a three-year-old cow that has never been whipped to solve the problem,” forcing the supply personnel to search the entire country for this special cowhide. The worker masses were indignant and conducted experiments with ordinary cowhide, repeatedly improving it, and finally solved the technical bottleneck.

“Without systems, the masses will not care about production,” “Workers will not work hard if no one manages them.” This is a blatant exposure of the reactionary nature of a small clique of bourgeois lords, a vicious and shameless slander against the working class. The number one traitor Liu Shaoqi has always stood on the reactionary position of the bourgeoisie, seeing himself as “Zhuge Liang,” the manager, and the masses as “Liu Bei,” the managed. He is the most enthusiastic propagandist of the feudal reactionary philosophy of “the brainy rule over the brawny”!

Under the guidance of this reactionary ideology of “management first,” to control and suppress workers, a small clique of capitalist-roaders and reactionary technical “authorities” in the aviation industry’s Party, in enterprise management, racked their brains to import cumbersome regulations from capitalism and revisionism. Some factories had over 1.6 million characters of regulations, tying the workers’ hands tightly. To suppress the worker masses and allow them to be manipulated, they also issued an order that “work procedures are the law,” treating foreign books as sacred scriptures. Whoever violated it was considered a lawbreaker, and they would be suppressed.

The worker masses produce and work for the interests of their class. The working class is the true master of the enterprise. The worker masses have always firmly resisted the bourgeois “factory rules” and “factory laws” that control and suppress workers. They have always despised those outdated foreign books. Even under the heavy suppression of a small clique of capitalist-roaders and reactionary technical “authorities,” the worker masses’ technological innovations and technological revolutions have never stopped. However, the technological experiences summarized by the worker masses, kicking aside the impractical foreign books, were called “black materials” by the capitalist-roaders. The new tools created by the worker masses, discarding the unusable foreign tools, were called “black tools” by the capitalist-roaders. In one factory, in collusion with the capitalist-roaders at the department and factory levels, they did not clean out the ghosts and snakes during the “Four Cleanups,” but instead searched through the workers’ belongings, confiscating thousands of “black materials” and a large number of “black tools.” Despite the capitalist-roaders repeatedly confiscating them using their authority, the worker masses continued to innovate and create. Any reactionary system that does not allow revolution cannot eliminate the revolutionary spirit and creativity of the working class.

“Now there are many amateurs and few professionals, not understanding this, the aviation industry cannot be managed well.” The traitor Liu Shaoqi’s agents here refer to “amateurs” as technicians of worker origin; “professionals” refer to those bourgeois technical “authorities” who cling to foreign books and are willing to be lackeys of foreigners. They shout loudly that there are too many “amateurs” and too few “professionals,” attempting to maintain the hegemony of bourgeois technical “authorities” in the production and technology domain of the enterprise and to compete with the proletariat for successors.

Technicians of worker origin love Chairman Mao the most, love socialism the most, have knowledge, have abilities, do not pursue empty fame, and can do practical work. This team of technicians of worker origin is a major obstacle to the bourgeois reactionary “authorities” monopolizing the power of production and technology and implementing “expert management.” Therefore, they regard them as a great enemy and use various means to exclude and attack them. One factory implemented an engineer examination system, stipulating that “one must master a foreign language and be able to write papers in a foreign language” to become an engineer. In this way, more than 300 worker technical cadres who grew up during the Great Leap Forward were all deemed “unqualified” and eliminated.

Those bourgeois reactionary “authorities” vigorously spread the idea that “good technicians can solve problems without going to the workshop.” They poisoned young technical personnel, scheming to make them detached from politics, detached from the masses, detached from reality, and walk the path of becoming bourgeois successors. The struggle between “amateurs” and “professionals” is the fierce struggle between two lines in the aviation industry, a fierce struggle over which class to cultivate technical personnel. Chairman Mao recently instructed us: “Follow the path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in cultivating technical personnel from among workers.” This is the only correct path, an important guarantee for the working class to firmly grasp the power of production and technology in enterprises and prevent capitalist restoration.

In summary, the revisionist fallacies such as “workers lack knowledge,” “workers need to be managed,” and “there are many amateurs and few professionals” that the traitor Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the aviation industry have been vigorously spreading, boil down to one point: attempting to deny the leading position of the working class and seize the leadership of the enterprise. “Expert management” is the bourgeois dictatorship over the working class.

The working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought is the most revolutionary and thorough. When the traitor Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the aviation industry attempted to obstruct our country’s aviation industry from taking the path of self-reliance, through technological crawling, to achieve political dependence on American imperialism and Soviet revisionism, becoming their appendages, the aviation industry workers, from the very beginning, keenly exposed this small clique of class enemies’ conspiracy and engaged in a head-on struggle with them.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution thundered, and the working class, holding high the banner of “It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries,” thoroughly smashed the independent kingdoms controlled by the traitor Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the aviation industry. The revisionist black goods of “expert management” were swept into the dustbin of history. The working class became the true master of the aviation industry, and the appearance of the enterprise underwent a fundamental change. Mao Zedong Thought study classes were set up everywhere, and revolutionary criticism battlefields were laid out everywhere. The revolution was booming, and production was thriving. “Never have we seen the people so spirited, so full of vigor, so full of initiative.” The great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: “Our country has seven hundred million people. The working class is the leading class. We must fully bring into play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work.” This instruction greatly encouraged this previously suppressed industrial worker force, making them burst forth with tremendous revolutionary enthusiasm and extraordinary creative wisdom. Technological innovations and technological revolutions in many enterprises emerged like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, and a new high tide of all-around advancement has arrived!

Let the traitor Liu Shaoqi and his revisionist black goods of “expert management” go to hell! Let those domestic and foreign reactionaries say that we cannot do this or that! “The Chinese people have the spirit, have the ability, and will definitely catch up with and surpass the world’s advanced level in the not-too-distant future!”

    工人阶级永远是航空工业的主人
    ——彻底批判叛徒刘少奇推行“专家治厂”的滔天罪行
    国防工业毛泽东思想学习班第三班
    在航空工业建设的道路上，一直存在着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，斗争的焦点，始终集中在一个权字上面：是工人阶级领导一切，还是资产阶级领导一切；是坚持群众路线，还是实行“专家治厂”。这是航空工业依靠谁来建设，由那个阶级掌权，为那个阶级服务，走什么道路的头等重要问题。
    早在一九二六年，毛主席就指出：“工业无产阶级是我们革命的领导力量。”全国胜利前夕，在党的七届二中全会上，毛主席又教导说：“我们必须全心全意地依靠工人阶级”。航空工业建立之初，以毛主席为首的党中央就抽调大量的老兵工工人、解放军战士和优秀干部，加强航空工业的职工队伍，以保证领导权掌握在工人阶级手里，然而，就在这个时候，大叛徒刘少奇却恶狠狠地说：“工人阶级在一定时候也可能是不能依靠的。”那么他要依靠谁呢？不依靠工人阶级，当然就要依靠资产阶级。果然，大叛徒刘少奇及其在航空工业的代理人打着“航空归队”的幌子，大肆网罗资产阶级技术“权威”，国民党的残渣余孽，拚命地与工人阶级争夺航空工业的领导权。
    大叛徒刘少奇及其在航空工业的代理人为了否定工人阶级的领导地位，为了搞资产阶级“专家治厂”，专工人群众的政，制造了种种反革命修正主义的谬论，必须彻底批判。
    “应该有一些工程师出身的人当厂长”，“工人没有知识，解决不了问题。”这是他们明目张胆地为资产阶级篡权所制造的反革命舆论。航空工业的一小撮走资派秉承大叛徒刘少奇的意旨，公开鼓吹“在生产技术上要依靠专家”。在他们的庇护下，那些反动技术“权威”一个个加官晋爵，甚至设法把他们拉到党内来。
    他们为了把这些资产阶级反动“权威”捧上天去，就拚命地诬蔑工人没有知识，解决不了问题。实际上资产阶级“权威”有的只是压迫工人、管卡工人、办资本主义企业的知识。在企业里，真正有知识，真正解决大问题的是工人群众。有一种产品，曾经遇到一个技术关键，当时，资产阶级“权威”束手无策，赶忙把洋本本上的规定搬出来，说“要用三周岁的，没有挨过鞭子抽的牛屁股上那块牛皮作原料才能解决”，硬逼着供应人员跑遍全国去采购这种特殊的牛皮。工人群众气不过，自己用普通的牛皮作试验，经过反复改进，终于解决了这个技术关键。
    “没有制度，群众就不关心生产”，“工人没有人管，就不好好干活。”这是一小撮资产阶级老爷反动本性的大暴露，是他们对工人阶级恶毒的无耻的诬蔑。刘少奇这个头号大工贼向来就是站在资产阶级的反动立场上，把自己看成是“诸葛亮”，是管人的，把群众看成是“阿斗”，是被管的。他是“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的封建反动哲学最狂热的吹鼓手！
    在这种“管”字当头的反动思想指导下，为了管卡工人，航空工业的党内一小撮走资派和反动技术“权威”，在企业管理方面挖空心思地从资本主义、修正主义那里搬来了烦琐得惊人的规章制度。有的工厂各种规章就有一百六十多万字，把工人的手脚捆得死死的。为了压制工人群众，听任他们摆布，他们还颁发了一道“工艺规程就是法律”的命令，把洋本本奉为金科玉律，谁若违犯，就是犯了法，他们就要实行镇压。
    工人群众为自己的阶级利益而生产而工作，工人阶级是企业真正的主人。对于那些管卡工人的资产阶级“厂规”“厂法”，工人群众从来就是坚决抵制的。对于那些早已陈旧落后的洋本本，工人群众从来就是蔑视的。就是在一小撮走资派和反动技术“权威”的重重压制下面，工人群众的技术革新和技术革命从来也没有间断过。但是，工人群众踢开脱离实际的洋本本，总结出来的技术经验，被走资派叫做“黑资料”，工人群众扔掉不适用的外国工具，自己创造出来的新工具，被走资派叫做“黑工具”。有一个工厂，在部、厂走资派的勾结下，搞四清不去清牛鬼蛇神，却从工人那里翻箱倒柜，清走了几千项“黑资料”和大批“黑工具”。尽管走资派利用职权反复地清，工人群众还是不断地进行创造、革新，任何不准革命的反动制度，是消灭不了工人阶级的革命精神和创造能力的。
    “现在是票友多、科班少，不懂得这个，不能办好航空工业。”叛徒刘少奇在航空工业的代理人这里讲的“票友”，是指工人出身的技术员；“科班”，是指那些死抱洋本本，甘当洋奴才的资产阶级技术“权威”。他们大叫大嚷“票友”多了，“科班”少了，就是妄图在企业的生产技术领域里维持资产阶级技术“权威”的一统天下，与无产阶级争夺接班人。
    工人出身的技术员最热爱毛主席，最热爱社会主义，他们有知识，有能力，不务空名，会干实事。这支工人出身的技术队伍是资产阶级反动“权威”独霸生产技术大权、推行“专家治厂”的大障碍，因此，他们视如大敌，千方百计地进行排挤和打击。有个工厂搞了一个工程师考试制度，规定“要会一国外文，能用外文写论文”，才能当工程师。就这样，大跃进中成长起来的三百多名工人技术干部都“不合格”，都被刷掉了。
    那些资产阶级的反动“权威”，极力散布“好的技术员不下楼就能解决问题。”以此毒害青年技术人员，阴谋使他们脱离政治，脱离群众，脱离实际，走白专道路，成为资产阶级的接班人。“票友”与“科班”之争，就是航空工业两条路线的激烈斗争，就是培养那个阶级的技术人员的激烈斗争。毛主席最近指示我们：“走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。”这是一条唯一正确的道路，是工人阶级牢牢掌握企业生产技术大权，防止资本主义复辟的重要保证。
    总之，叛徒刘少奇及其在航空工业的代理人所竭力散布的“工人没有知识”、“对工人要管”、“票友多，科班少”等修正主义的谬论，集中到一点，就是妄图否定工人阶级的领导地位，篡夺企业的领导权。“专家治厂”，就是对工人阶级实行资产阶级专政。
    毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级最富于革命的彻底性。当着叛徒刘少奇及其在航空工业的代理人妄图阻挠我国航空工业走自力更生的道路，通过技术上的爬行，达到政治上投靠美帝、苏修，成为他们附庸的时候，航空工业工人一开头就敏锐地识破了这一小撮阶级敌人的阴谋，同他们进行了针锋相对的斗争。
    无产阶级文化大革命一声霹雳，工人阶级高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，彻底摧毁了叛徒刘少奇及其在航空工业的代理人把持的独立王国，“专家治厂”的修正主义黑货被扫进历史的垃圾堆。工人阶级成了航空工业真正的主人，企业的面貌发生了天翻地覆的变化，处处办起了毛泽东思想学习班，处处摆开了革命大批判的战场，革命热气腾腾，生产蒸蒸日上，“从来也没有看见人民群众象现在这样精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发。”伟大的领袖毛主席最近又教导我们说：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。”这一指示大大鼓舞了这一支过去受压抑的产业工人队伍，使他们迸发出巨大的革命积极性和非凡的创造智慧，许多企业的技术革新和技术革命象雨后春笋一般涌现出来，一个全面跃进的新高潮已经到来了！
    让叛徒刘少奇连同他的“专家治厂”的修正主义黑货一块见鬼去吧！让那些国内外反动派说我们这也不行，那也不行吧！“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平”。
