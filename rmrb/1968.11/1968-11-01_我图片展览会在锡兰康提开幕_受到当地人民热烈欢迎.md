The Chinese People's Republic Photo Exhibition opened on October 25 in Kandy, an inland city of Ceylon. It was warmly welcomed by the local people.

Workers and farmers from the nearby suburbs and plantations of this city highly praised the exhibition. Some visitors wrote in the visitors' book: "Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. We will forever follow the path he has shown us." Others wrote: "We should learn from the hardworking and brave Chinese people."

Professor Gunawadana of the University of Ceylon, a historian, spoke at the opening ceremony, warmly praising the great achievements made by the People's Republic of China since its founding under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China in the fields of agriculture, industry, and scientific research.

The exhibition is organized by the Kandy branch of the Ceylon-China Friendship Association. Earlier, the Ratnapura branch of the Ceylon-China Friendship Association had held a similar exhibition on October 20.
