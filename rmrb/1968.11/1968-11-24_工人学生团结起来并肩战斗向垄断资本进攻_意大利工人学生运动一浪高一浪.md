Workers and students in Italy, fighting for their fundamental rights and against the exploitation and oppression of the monopoly bourgeoisie, are waging a struggle that is surging higher and higher.

The port city of Livorno in the Tuscany region saw its workers go on a general strike on November 21, demanding full employment. The strike paralyzed the entire city.

The city's middle school students also went on a strike the same day to support the workers' struggle. Over 5,000 students joined the workers' march. Workers and students together chanted, "Workers and students, unite and fight!" They also held up banners opposing the bourgeoisie's rule over enterprises and schools.

On November 22, workers in the Emilia region's city of Forlì went on a general strike to protest the capitalists' cruel exploitation and demand higher wages. Nearly 50,000 workers participated in the strike.

On the same day, 45,000 telephone workers across Italy went on a 24-hour strike to protest layoffs.

On November 22, 7,000 sugar workers also went on a nationwide strike. Sugar workers had been occupying 12 sugar factories in recent days to protest the Eridania Sugar Company's plan to close numerous factories under the guise of "rationalization." According to this plan, half of the current 87 sugar factories will be shut down; hundreds of workers have already been laid off.

Meanwhile, the wave of Italian students opposing the corrupt educational system and protesting the authorities' suppression of the student movement continues to rise. On November 21, students from 27 middle schools, technical schools, and vocational schools in Turin persisted in their strike. Thousands of students took to the streets for the third consecutive day and held a demonstration outside the Turin Education Bureau.

In the city of Parma in the Emilia region, over 7,000 students held a demonstration. In Cagliari, the capital of Sardinia, 5,000 students also held a demonstration.

In Florence, all middle schools went on a general strike on November 21. Thousands of students held a demonstration, protesting the authorities' persecution of three workers and three students. In several departments of the University of Florence, which had been occupied by students, middle school students held protest meetings.

In cities like Rome and Milan, students also launched strikes, marches, and school occupations.
