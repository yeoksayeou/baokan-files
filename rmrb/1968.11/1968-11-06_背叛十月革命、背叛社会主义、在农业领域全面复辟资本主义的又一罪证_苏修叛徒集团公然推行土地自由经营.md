The Soviet revisionist clique, in order to adapt to the development of capitalist free competition and kulak economy in agriculture, has recently concocted a so-called "Draft Principles of Soviet Land Legislation." This draft, in some fundamental issues, emasculates and distorts the fundamental principles of land nationalization proposed by the great revolutionary leader Lenin, stipulating that the land in rural areas, which was nationalized after the October Revolution, can be freely transferred and leased in disguise, allowing a large amount of private plots to develop, and encouraging capitalist free management, etc. This is another serious step taken by the Soviet revisionist traitors to fully restore capitalism in the agricultural sector of the Soviet Union, and is another new crime of their betrayal of the October Revolution and socialism.

Destroying land nationalization and socialist land relations and solidifying them in legal form

After the great October Socialist Revolution in 1917, the Soviet government announced the abolition of private land ownership and the implementation of land nationalization. This policy was personally formulated by the great Lenin, the founder of the world's first socialist state. It is one of the most important achievements of the October Revolution. Later, during the period of Stalin's leadership, the Soviet Union issued a series of laws and decisions to maintain and develop the socialist land nationalization system. After the Soviet revisionist clique usurped the party and state power in the Soviet Union, they carried out the restoration of capitalism, turning the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, fundamentally changing the class content of the original socialist land nationalization system in the Soviet Union. On the fiftieth anniversary of the October Revolution, the Soviet revisionist traitors Brezhnev and Kosygin and the like openly proclaim that the fundamental principles of some land laws issued during the period when Lenin and Stalin led the Soviet Union are "outdated" and do not meet the "requirements of the times." The so-called "Draft Principles of Soviet Land Legislation" thrown out by the Soviet revisionists in June of this year has solidified their destruction of land nationalization and socialist land relations achieved after the October Revolution in the form of state laws.

As long as compensation can be obtained, land can be freely transferred and leased

After the October Revolution, the land laws issued by the Soviet state clearly stipulated that private land ownership is permanently abolished and that land is not allowed to be sold, leased, or "transferred in any other form." Later, the Soviet government, in order to ensure the victory of the collective farm system and to guarantee that the important fruit of the October Revolution—land nationalization—is not violated, issued a resolution prohibiting any redivision, sale, and lease of collective farm land, and strictly limiting the transfer of part of the land of this or that collective farm to other land users. However, the "Draft Principles of Soviet Land Legislation" recently thrown out by the Soviet revisionist clique stipulates that "an agricultural unit" can "transfer part of the arable land to another agricultural unit for fixed use"; it can also transfer part of the arable land fixed by the state to them to "another collective farm, state farm, and other agricultural units for temporary use," and the "agricultural unit using this land segment for a certain period" must provide "compensation" to the original land user "corresponding to the land use period." These twisted and obscure clauses actually mean: in the current Soviet Union, as long as a certain amount of "compensation" can be obtained, land can be freely transferred and leased between "collective farms" and "state farms." What is this if not a betrayal of the October Revolution?

Privately dividing and encroaching on public land, advocating the use of land according to capitalist profit principles

After seizing the leadership of the Soviet party and state, Khrushchev did everything possible to encourage and support the development of private agricultural economy, destroying and disintegrating the original collective farm economy and state farm economy. After Brezhnev and Kosygin and the like came to power, they went even further in this regard, and from the very beginning of their tenure, they passed a series of decisions to further encourage the development of "private plots" (i.e., private plots) and private livestock. With their support and encouragement, in recent years, the situation of privately dividing and encroaching on the land of "collective farms" and "state farms" and arbitrarily expanding "private plots" in many rural areas of the Soviet Union has become increasingly serious, and private economy and rural capitalist forces have swelled to an unprecedented degree of malignancy.

Now, the "Draft Principles of Soviet Land Legislation" passed by the Soviet revisionist clique not only stipulates that "collective farm members" and "permanent employees of state farms" can have "private plots," but also stipulates that "teachers, doctors, and other experts working and living in rural areas," "workers, employees, pensioners (i.e., retirees), and disabled persons living in rural areas," "maintenance personnel of transportation and trunk pipelines, communication lines, forestry stations, forestry areas, and state nurseries" are provided with "private plots."

According to the decisions and the "Model Constitution of the Soviet Agricultural Labor Associations" passed by the Soviet party and government during the Stalin period, the public land handed over to collective farms by the state for indefinite use is inviolable and "it is not allowed to reduce the collective farm's public land to expand the total amount of private plots." However, in order to encourage private economy and adapt to the need to continuously expand private "private plots," the Brezhnev and Kosygin clique openly abolished the past restrictions in their "Draft Principles of Soviet Land Legislation" and explicitly stipulated that "collective farms" can "allocate public-use land to expand the total amount of private plots." In this way, they have pushed their retrograde and reactionary practices of developing private economy and destroying collective economy in the past few years even further.

The Brezhnev and Kosygin clique also, under the name of "rational use of land," abandoned the socialist agricultural planning system and encouraged capitalist free management of agriculture. In order to adapt to the needs of the privileged class and the new kulaks in the countryside to engage in capitalist management, they fiercely attacked the socialist agricultural planning system as "bureaucratic" and "unnecessary." They advocated that "collective farms" and "state farms" should "develop production in areas where they make the most profit." Now, they are further advocating the use of land according to capitalist profit principles in the "Draft Principles of Soviet Land Legislation."

Capitalist forces are rampant, class differentiation is intensifying, and new kulaks are enthusiastically cheering

The fact that the Brezhnev and Kosygin clique has concocted such a so-called "Draft Principles of Soviet Land Legislation" is not accidental. In recent years, this group of traitors has vigorously promoted the "new economic system" with capitalist profit principles as the core in various sectors of the Soviet national economy and carried out the so-called "economic reform." As an important sector of the national economy, agriculture, like the industrial sector, has been deeply mired in the capitalist abyss. In the vast rural areas of the Soviet Union, capitalist forces are rampant, and class differentiation is intensifying. The Soviet revisionist clique's current revisionist "Draft Principles of Soviet Land Legislation" is formulated to adapt to the further restoration of capitalism in agriculture and to satisfy the interests of a small group of bourgeois privileged classes and new kulaks in the countryside.

Therefore, as soon as this "Draft Principles of Soviet Land Legislation" was published in Soviet newspapers, it was enthusiastically cheered by a small group of privileged classes and new kulaks in the Soviet countryside. They shouted that this is a solution to "many problems in land relations in a new way," and is a "more precise and fairer means" of "economic stimulation" in agriculture, "completely in line with the spirit of the ongoing economic reform," etc. This can be seen from what kind of thing the "Draft Principles of Soviet Land Legislation" is.

The Soviet people will further recognize the true face of the Soviet revisionist clique

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Revolutionaries who appear in disguise will give people a false appearance while hiding their true nature. But since they want to counter-revolution, they cannot completely hide their true nature." As soon as the Soviet revisionist clique's "Draft Principles of Soviet Land Legislation" was published, many Soviet laborers saw through its reactionary nature at a glance. A worker from a Soviet agricultural institution said: this "Draft Principles of Soviet Land Legislation" actually stipulates that "land should have a price, and this price should be reflected when changing the land user," which is "restoring the price-forming factors that operate in a society with private land ownership," destroying land nationalization. A collective farm cadre pointed out that a series of clauses in this "Draft Principles of Soviet Land Legislation" about the "transfer of land use" actually negate land nationalization. He also pointed out that the provision in the draft about "land users should use land rationally" is "contradictory to the planned task," and doing so is to engage in free land management.

It can be foreseen that this Soviet "Draft Principles of Soviet Land Legislation" will become another negative textbook for the revolutionary people of the Soviet Union, enabling them to further recognize the true face of the traitors Brezhnev and Kosygin and the like who destroy the fruits of the victory of the October Revolution.

    背叛十月革命、背叛社会主义、在农业领域全面复辟资本主义的又一罪证
    苏修叛徒集团公然推行土地自由经营
    新华社五日讯　本社记者述评：苏修叛徒集团为了适应在农业中发展资本主义自由竞争和富农经济的需要，最近炮制出一个所谓苏联《土地立法原则（草案）》。这个草案在一些根本问题上阉割和篡改了伟大的革命导师列宁当年提出的有关土地国有化的根本原则，规定十月革命后全部收归国有的农村土地可以自由转让、变相出租，允许大量发展自留地，鼓励资本主义的自由经营等等。这是苏修叛徒在苏联农业领域全面复辟资本主义的又一严重步骤，是他们背叛十月革命、背叛社会主义的又一新罪证。
    破坏土地国有化和社会主义土地关系，并以法律形式固定下来
    在一九一七年伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利之后，苏维埃政府就宣布了废除土地私有制、实现土地国有化的政策。这项政策是世界上第一个社会主义国家的缔造者伟大的列宁亲手制订的。它是十月革命最重要的成果之一。以后，在斯大林领导时期，苏联又颁布了一系列法令和决定，维护和发展土地国有制和社会主义土地关系。苏修叛徒集团篡夺苏联党政大权以后，在苏联实行资本主义复辟，把无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政，使苏联原来的社会主义土地国有制从阶级内容上发生了根本的变化。在十月革命过去半个世纪的今天，苏修叛徒勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流，公然叫嚷什么列宁、斯大林领导苏联时期颁布的土地法的一些根本原则，“早已过时”，不符合“时代的要求”。苏修叛徒于今年六月抛出的所谓苏联《土地立法原则（草案）》，把他们对十月革命后实现的土地国有化和社会主义土地关系的破坏，以国家法律的形式固定下来。
    只要能拿到“补偿”，就可以自由转让、出租土地
    十月革命后，苏维埃国家颁布的土地法令中明确规定，永远废除土地私有权，禁止出卖、出租或“以任何其他形式出让土地”。后来，苏联政府为保证集体农庄制度的胜利发展，保障十月革命的重要果实——土地国有化不受侵犯，又作出决议，禁止任何重新划分、买卖和出租集体农庄土地，严格限制把这个或那个集体农庄的土地的一部分转交给其他的土地使用者。然而，苏修叛徒集团最近抛出的《土地立法原则（草案）》却规定，“一个农业单位”可以“将部分可耕地转交另一农业单位固定使用”；也可以把国家固定交给他们的可耕地中的一部分“转交给需要这些土地的集体农庄、国营农场和其他农业单位临时使用”，而“在一定时期使用这一地段的农业单位”，必须向原土地使用者提供“与土地使用期限相应”的“补偿”。这些转弯抹角晦涩难懂的条文，实际上就是说：在现在的苏联“集体农庄”、“国营农场”之间，只要能拿到一定的“补偿”，就可以自由转让、出租土地。这不是对十月革命的背叛，又是什么呢？
    私分、侵占公共土地，鼓吹按资本主义利润原则使用土地
    赫鲁晓夫篡夺了苏联党和国家的领导权以后，就千方百计鼓励和扶植私有农业经济的发展，破坏和瓦解原来的集体农庄经济和国营农场经济。勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流上台后，在这方面走得更远，他们上台伊始就通过一系列决定，进一步鼓励发展“宅旁园地”（即自留地）和私有牲畜。在他们的支持和怂恿下，最近几年，苏联许多加盟共和国的农村中，私分和侵占“集体农庄”和“国营农场”的土地，任意扩大“宅旁园地”的情况日益严重，私有经济和农村资本主义势力，空前恶性地膨胀起来。
    现在，苏修叛徒集团通过的这个《土地立法原则（草案）》中，不仅规定“集体农庄庄员”和“国营农场的固定职工”可以拥有“宅旁园地”，而且还规定向“在农村地区工作和居住的教师、医生和其他专家”、“住在农村地区的工人、职员、领养老金者（即退休人员）、残废者”，“交通和干线管道、通讯线路的保养人员，林场、林业区、国营苗圃的工作人员”等提供“宅旁园地”。
    根据斯大林时期苏联党和政府通过的有关土地的决定和《苏联农业劳动组合标准章程》的规定，国家交给集体农庄无限期使用的公共土地是不可侵犯的，“不允许以缩小集体农庄公共土地来扩大宅旁园地总额”。而勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团为了鼓励私有经济，适应不断扩大私人“宅旁园地”的需要，在他们的《土地立法原则（草案）》中公然废除了过去的限制，明文规定“集体农庄”“可以拨出公共使用的土地来扩大宅旁园地的总额”。这样，就把他们过去几年发展私有经济、破坏集体经济的倒行逆施，又向前推进了一步。
    勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团还在“合理地使用土地”的名义下，抛弃社会主义农业计划制度，鼓励农业的资本主义自由经营。他们为了适应特权阶层和农村新富农分子搞资本主义经营的需要，大肆攻击社会主义的农业计划制度是“官僚主义的”，是“不必要的”。他们鼓吹“集体农庄”和“国营农场”“那方面赢利最多，就发展那方面的生产。”现在，他们又在《土地立法原则（草案）》中进一步鼓吹按资本主义的利润原则来使用土地。
    资本主义势力泛滥，阶级分化加剧，新富农分子狂热喝采
    勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团炮制出这样一个所谓《土地立法原则（草案）》，绝不是偶然的。最近几年来，这一伙叛徒在苏联各个国民经济部门大力推行以资本主义利润原则为核心的“新经济体制”，进行所谓“经济改革”。作为国民经济的一个重要部门的农业，和工业等经济部门一样，越来越深地陷入资本主义的深渊。在苏联广大农村中，资本主义势力空前泛滥，阶级分化日益加剧。苏修叛徒集团现在这个修正主义的《土地立法原则（草案）》，就是为适应进一步在农业中复辟资本主义，为满足农村中一小撮资产阶级特权阶层和新富农分子的利益而制定的。
    因此，这个《土地立法原则（草案）》在苏联报刊上一发表，就受到了苏联农村中一小撮特权阶层和新富农分子的热烈喝采。他们叫嚷这是对土地关系中的“许多问题按照崭新的方式予以解决”，是在农业中实行“经济刺激”的一种“更精密、更公正的手段”，“完全符合正在实现的经济改革的精神”，等等。这就可以看出，这个《土地立法原则（草案）》到底是什么货色。
    苏联人民将进一步认清苏修集团的叛徒真面目
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出：“以伪装出现的反革命分子，他们给人以假象，而将真象荫蔽着。但是他们既要反革命，就不可能将其真象荫蔽得十分彻底。”苏修叛徒集团这个《土地立法原则（草案）》一公布，不少的苏联劳动人民就一眼看穿了它的反动本质。一位苏联农业机构的职工说：这个《土地立法原则（草案）》实际上就是规定“土地应当有价格，而这个价格应当在更换土地使用者时表现出来”，这就是“恢复在土地私有制社会中起作用的价格形成因素”，破坏了土地国有制。一位集体农庄干部指出，这个《土地立法原则（草案）》中一系列关于“土地使用的转让”的条款，实际上否定了土地国有制。他还指出，草案关于“土地使用者应当合理地使用土地”的规定，是“同计划任务相矛盾的”，这样做就是搞土地自由经营。
    可以肯定，苏修这个《土地立法原则（草案）》将成为苏联革命人民又一个反面教材，使他们进一步认清勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流破坏十月革命胜利果实的叛徒真面目。
