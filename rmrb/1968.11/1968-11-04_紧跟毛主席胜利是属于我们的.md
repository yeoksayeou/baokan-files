In the face of a great situation both domestically and internationally, and amidst the triumphant songs of the great, decisive victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the communiqué of the enlarged 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Party has been issued. This communiqué is excellent! It greatly boosts the morale of the revolutionary people and crushes the arrogance of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries. We, the workers of Anhui and the people of the entire province, enthusiastically support it, actively propagate it, and resolutely carry it out! We sincerely wish our great leader Chairman Mao a long, long life! Long, long life! Long, long life!

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are aimed at seizing power and consolidating it." Since Chairman Mao issued the great revolutionary document "Bombard the Headquarters," the broad masses of soldiers and civilians across the country, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, have, after more than two years of extremely complex and sharp class struggles, finally smashed the bourgeois headquarters represented by Liu Shaoqi, which attempted to usurp the Party, the government, and the military. We have seized back the power that was usurped by them and have permanently expelled from the Party this traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, who is a running dog of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and has committed countless crimes. The resolution of the 8th Enlarged 12th Plenary Session of the Party speaks the words of our working class and expresses the wishes of the broad revolutionary people. Liu Shaoqi, this traitor, spy, and scoundrel, is our working class's sworn enemy. Expelling him from the Party is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought! It is a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

The 8th Enlarged 12th Plenary Session of the Party calls on the entire military and civilian population: "Resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instruction that the working class must lead everything, implement the dictatorship of the proletariat in the superstructure, including all cultural domains, and carry out the tasks of the stages of struggle, criticism, and transformation proposed by Chairman Mao, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" This is the great call of the Party to us, and it is the great and glorious combat mission before us. We, the working class, will definitely follow the instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao, lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation in all domains of the superstructure, shoulder the double burden of revolution and production, and contribute all our strength to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must not, because of victory, relax our vigilance against the crazy revenge plots of the imperialist elements and their running dogs." The agents of Liu Shaoqi in Anhui, such as Li Baohua and Huang Yan, are still alive, and their hearts are not dead. Therefore, we must always maintain revolutionary vigilance, be ready at any time to smash all the evil plots of a handful of class enemies, and eliminate the reactionary revisionist thoughts of the biggest handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, such as Liu Shaoqi.

In the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely unite around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and together with the broad military and civilian population of the entire province, resolutely implement the latest combat orders issued by the 8th Enlarged 12th Plenary Session of the Party. With greater achievements, we will welcome the convening of the 9th National Congress of the Party and present our loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao.

Let the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries tremble before us! Victory will definitely be ours!

    紧跟毛主席胜利是属于我们的
    安徽省革命委员会副主任、工人代表　张秀英
    在国内国际一片大好形势下，在无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大的、决定性胜利的凯歌声中，党的第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会公报发表了。这个公报好极了！它大长了革命人民的志气，大灭了帝修反的威风。我们安徽工人阶级和全省人民最热烈地拥护、最积极地宣传、最坚决地执行！我们最最衷心地祝愿伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”自从毛主席发表《炮打司令部》这个伟大的革命文献以后，全国广大军民在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的英明领导下，经过两年多极其复杂、极其尖锐的阶级大搏斗，终于摧毁了以刘少奇为代表的妄图篡党、篡政、篡军的资产阶级司令部，夺回了被他们篡夺的那一部分权力，并且把这个埋藏在党内的叛徒、内奸、工贼、罪恶累累的帝国主义、现代修正主义和国民党反动派的走狗刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外的一切职务。党的八届扩大的十二中全会决议，说出了我们工人阶级的心里话，表达了广大革命人民的心愿。刘少奇这个叛徒、内奸、工贼是我们工人阶级不共戴天的死对头。把他开除出党，这是毛泽东思想的一个伟大胜利！这是无产阶级文化大革命的一个伟大胜利！
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会号召全国军民：“坚决执行毛主席关于工人阶级必须领导一切的教导，实现无产阶级在上层建筑其中包括在各个文化领域的专政，实现毛主席提出的关于斗、批、改各个阶段的任务，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”这是党向我们发出的伟大号召，是摆在我们面前的伟大而光荣的战斗任务。我们工人阶级一定遵照伟大领袖毛主席的指示，领导好上层建筑各个领域的斗、批、改，把革命和生产两副重担挑起来，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利贡献出我们的一切力量。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们决不可因为胜利，而放松对于帝国主义分子及其走狗们的疯狂的报复阴谋的警惕性”，刘少奇在安徽的代理人李葆华、黄岩之流，人还在，心不死。因此，我们要始终保持革命的警惕性，随时准备粉碎一小撮阶级敌人的一切罪恶阴谋，肃清刘少奇等党内最大的一小撮走资派的反革命修正主义的思想。
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中，我们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧密团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，同全省广大军民一道，坚决贯彻执行党的八届扩大的十二中全会发出的最新的战斗号令，用更大的成绩，迎接党的第九次全国代表大会的召开，向我们伟大领袖毛主席敬献忠心。
    让帝、修、反在我们面前发抖吧！胜利一定是属于我们的！
