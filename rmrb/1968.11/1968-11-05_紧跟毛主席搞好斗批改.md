Under the personal leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, which has great historical significance, was successfully convened. This is a great joyous event in the political life of the people of the entire country. The success of this session has dealt a heavy blow to a handful of imperialists led by the United States, modern revisionists led by the Soviet revisionist renegade clique, and domestic and foreign reactionaries. It has greatly inspired the people of the entire country to continue along the path pointed out by Chairman Mao and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. The communiqué of the plenary session expounded on the brilliant thoughts of our great leader Chairman Mao on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. It summarized the basic experiences of the past two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country and fully conveyed Chairman Mao's instructions on the tasks for each stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation. We must firmly follow our great leader Chairman Mao and earnestly implement the various combat tasks proposed in the communiqué of the plenary session to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Through the tempering of the storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our Party is purer, more united, more consolidated, and stronger than ever before. The plenary session decided to convene the Ninth National Congress of the Communist Party of China at an appropriate time, which is extremely wise and correct. We are determined to do a good job in struggle, criticism, and transformation and to welcome the successful convening of the Ninth National Congress of the Party.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jiangsu Province, like in other parts of the country, is getting better and better. The intense class struggle over the past two years has made us deeply understand a great truth: closely following the great leader Chairman Mao is victory! No matter how great the difficulties or how great the interference, as long as we promptly, accurately, and comprehensively convey and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the broad revolutionary masses and turn them into conscious actions, we can move from victory to victory!

The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party calls on us to accomplish the tasks for each stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation proposed by Chairman Mao and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Under the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, our province has already achieved remarkable results in struggle, criticism, and transformation. However, we clearly recognize that Jiangsu and Nanjing were once the strongholds of the Kuomintang's bloody counter-revolutionary rule and the place where the Chinese bourgeoisie made their fortunes. Liu Shaoqi, the faithful running dog of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, had been engaged in counter-revolutionary activities in Jiangsu since the Anti-Japanese War. After liberation, he carried out a counter-revolutionary revisionist line through his agents in Jiangsu, Jiang Yiqing and Chen Guang and the like. Although Jiang Yiqing and Chen Guang and the like have been swept into the dustbin of history, the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism spread by the Liu Shaoqi clique in various fields has not been thoroughly eliminated. Therefore, we must guard against arrogance and impatience, continue to press ahead, and continue to deepen the revolutionary criticism. We must seriously do a good job in cleaning up the class ranks, root out all counter-revolutionaries, and place the work of rectifying and building the Party in a very important position. We must strive to achieve the proletarian educational revolution, promote revolution, production, work, and preparedness, and solidly fight the battle of struggle, criticism, and transformation to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all the work of the entire Party, the entire army, and the entire country. We are determined to unify our thinking, steps, and actions with Mao Zedong Thought and bravely advance under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao!

    紧跟毛主席搞好斗批改
    在我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持下胜利召开了有伟大历史意义的党的第八届扩大的十二中全会，这是全国人民政治生活中的一件大喜事。这次会议的成功，沉重地打击了一小撮以美国为首的帝国主义者、以苏修叛徒集团为首的现代修正主义者和国内外反动派，极大地鼓舞了全国人民继续沿着毛主席指引的道路，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。全会公报阐述了伟大领袖毛主席关于在无产阶级专政下继续革命的光辉思想，总结了两年来我国无产阶级文化大革命的基本经验，全面地传达了毛主席提出的关于斗、批、改各个阶段的任务。我们一定坚定不移地紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，认真落实全会公报提出的各项战斗任务，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
    经过无产阶级文化大革命风暴的锻炼，我们党比任何时候都更加纯洁，更加团结，更加巩固，更加强大。全会决定在适当的时候召开中国共产党的第九次全国代表大会，这是非常英明正确的。我们决心认真搞好斗、批、改，迎接党的第九次全国代表大会的胜利召开。
    江苏省的无产阶级文化大革命和全国各地一样，形势越来越好。两年多来激烈的阶级斗争实践，使我们深刻地认识到一条伟大的真理：紧跟伟大领袖毛主席就是胜利！不管遇到多大的困难，受到多大的干扰，只要把毛主席的每一个最新指示，迅速、准确、全面地传达贯彻到广大革命群众中去，变为他们的自觉行动，就能从胜利走向胜利！
    党的第八届扩大的十二中全会，号召我们实现毛主席提出的关于斗、批、改各个阶段的任务，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的英明领导下，我省的斗、批、改虽然已经取得了显著的成绩，但是，我们清楚地认识到，江苏、南京过去是国民党反动派进行血腥的反革命统治的老巢，也是中国资产阶级发家的地方；刘少奇这条帝国主义、现代修正主义、国民党反动派的忠实走狗，早在抗日战争时期就在江苏大干反革命勾当，解放后又通过他在江苏的代理人江渭清、陈光之流，推行了一条反革命修正主义路线；江渭清、陈光之流虽然已被扫进了历史的垃圾堆，但是刘少奇一伙在各个领域散布的反革命修正主义的流毒并没有彻底肃清。因此，我们一定要戒骄戒躁，再接再厉，继续深入搞好革命大批判，认真做好清理阶级队伍的工作，把一切反革命分子统统挖出来，并把整党建党工作放在非常重要的地位，努力实现无产阶级教育革命，抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备，扎扎实实打好斗、批、改这一仗，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    毛泽东思想是全党、全军和全国一切工作的指导方针。我们决心用毛泽东思想统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席奋勇前进！
