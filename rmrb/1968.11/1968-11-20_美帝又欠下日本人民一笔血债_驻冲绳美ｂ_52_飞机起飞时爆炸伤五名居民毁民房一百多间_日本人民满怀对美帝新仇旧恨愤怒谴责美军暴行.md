The U.S. imperialists have incurred another debt of blood to the Japanese people. A B-52 bomber stationed at the U.S. base in Kadena, Okinawa, exploded during takeoff early in the morning of the 19th, injuring five local residents and destroying 139 houses.

This is yet another blood debt that U.S. imperialism owes to the Japanese people.

According to reports, the American aggressor plane was loaded with bombs intended to massacre the Vietnamese people. During the explosion, it emitted a series of loud noises, followed by a towering column of fire, and the blaze continued for two hours.

In an attempt to cover up its crimes, the U.S. military authorities in Okinawa immediately sealed off the area around the base and the transportation between Okinawa and the Japanese mainland after the plane exploded. They also dispatched armed troops in an attempt to prevent local residents from protesting and demonstrating at the Kadena base.

Following the incident, the broad masses of people in Okinawa and the Japanese mainland immediately took action. Filled with new and old grievances against the U.S., they held various protest activities and strongly condemned the U.S. military's atrocities.

　　日本人民满怀对美帝新仇旧恨愤怒谴责美军暴行
    新华社十九日讯　东京消息：美帝驻在冲绳嘉手纳基地的一架Ｂ—52型轰炸机十九日凌晨在起飞时突然爆炸，伤害了五名冲绳居民，毁坏了当地居民的一百三十九间房屋。
    这是美帝国主义对日本人民欠下的又一笔血债。
    据报道，这架美国强盗飞机装载着屠杀越南人民的炸弹。它在爆炸时连续发出巨响，接着火柱冲天，熊熊大火持续两小时之久。
    冲绳美军当局为了掩盖它的罪行，在飞机爆炸后立即封锁了基地附近以及冲绳与日本本土之间的交通，并派出武装军队妄图阻止当地居民到嘉手纳基地去抗议和示威。
    冲绳和日本本土的广大人民在事件发生后立即行动起来。他们怀着对美帝的新仇旧恨，举行各种抗议活动，强烈谴责美军暴行。
