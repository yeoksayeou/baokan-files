This suggestion is in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought.

Who should run rural schools? This is a fundamental question. For many years, Liu Shaoqi has promoted a whole set of counter-revolutionary revisionist educational policies, doing everything possible to prevent us poor and lower-middle peasants from running schools. Under the guise of "full-time" and "standardized" education, they have suppressed private schools, turning most rural primary schools into "paradises" detached from the three great revolutionary movements, creating a rift between schools and the poor and lower-middle peasants.

If public schools are handed over to the production brigades to run, it will ensure that the power of rural education is firmly in the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants, truly integrating school education with the three great revolutionary movements, and thus cultivating reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

If public schools are handed over to the production brigades to run, it will also create extremely favorable conditions for the ideological transformation of the teaching staff. In the past, many teachers were poisoned by the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi, although they were in the countryside, they looked down upon the poor and lower-middle peasants and could not wholeheartedly serve them. Teacher Li Xue Mei, sent by the poor and lower-middle peasants to the school, has deep feelings about this. She once went to a poor peasant's home, and the peasant woman was very enthusiastic. She fried dumplings to treat her, and Li Xue Mei repeatedly declined, but the peasant woman insisted, saying, "You are a teacher sent by us poor and lower-middle peasants, so I sincerely want you to eat. If it were those who are not sincere with us, I would not let you."

Regarding the specific methods proposed by comrades Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu and the advantages of these methods, we basically agree. However, considering the actual situation of our brigade, some adjustments should be made. These are:

1. In Xishan Brigade, apart from the children of peasants, a considerable number of students are children of workers. According to preliminary calculations, the annual school funds for schools within the Xishan Brigade area are approximately between 30,000 and 40,000 yuan. If all of this is handed over to the brigade to bear, it would be too heavy a burden. We suggest that each place should adopt the method of public assistance to solve the problem according to different specific situations.

2. For teachers who have difficulty making a living after receiving work points, they should be helped and solved in the same way as the poor and lower-middle peasants by the brigade. If they are subsidized according to the original salary level of the teachers, they will still be detached from the poor and lower-middle peasants, which is not conducive to the ideological transformation of the teachers.

### 这个建议符合毛泽东思想

　　这个建议符合毛泽东思想
    农村学校到底应该由谁来办？这是一个根本性的问题。多少年来，刘少奇推行了一整套反革命修正主义教育路线，千方百计不让我们贫下中农办学。他们打着“全日制”、“正规化”的破旗，扼杀民办小学，把广大农村小学办成了脱离三大革命运动的“世外桃源”，造成了学校与贫下中农的对立。
    公办学校下放到大队来办，就可以保证农村教育大权最彻底地掌握在贫下中农手中，真正把学校教育和三大革命运动紧密结合起来，从而培养出无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。
    公办学校下放到大队来办，也为教师队伍的思想革命化创造了极为有利的条件。过去，不少教师中了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的毒，虽然身在农村，可是看不起贫下中农，不能全心全意为贫下中农服务。贫下中农派进学校的教师李雪梅深有体会地说：有一次，我到一位贫农大娘家里去，大娘热情得很，她用油煎饺子招待我，我再三推让，她非要我吃不可。她说：“你是咱贫下中农派去的教师，我才实心实意地要你吃，要是那些和咱不一心的，我就不让了。”
    关于侯振民、王庆余同志提出的一些具体办法和说明这些办法的好处，我们基本上同意。但按照我们大队实际情况，似应有些变通的做法。这就是：
    一、西山大队的学生中，除农民子女外，有相当大一部分是职工的子女。据初步计算，西山大队范围内的学校经费，每年大约在三万元到四万元之间，如果全部下放到大队负担，就有些过重。我们建议，各地应按照不同的具体情况，采取民办公助的办法解决。
    二、教师记工分后，生活实在有困难的，应当同贫下中农一样，由大队给予帮助解决。如果按教师原工资水平补助，仍然脱离贫下中农，不利于教师的思想改造。北京四季青公社西山大队贫下中农管理学校委员会
