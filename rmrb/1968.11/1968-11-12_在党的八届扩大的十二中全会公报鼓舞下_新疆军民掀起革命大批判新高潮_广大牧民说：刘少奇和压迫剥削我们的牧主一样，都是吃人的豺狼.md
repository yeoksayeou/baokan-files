Inspired by the communiqué of the Party's Eighth Plenum of the Twelfth Session, the military and civilians of Xinjiang, a region of thirteen ethnic groups, are launching a new high tide of revolutionary criticism. They are fighting on the front lines against imperialism and revisionism, deeply moved by the great leader Chairman Mao. They are determined to carry out the great battle tasks proposed in the communiqué.

Currently, from the foothills of the Karakoram Mountains to the snowy grasslands of Altay, from the oases of Hami to the valleys of the Ili River, every factory, village, tent, and outpost, revolutionary masses and PLA soldiers are earnestly implementing the great battle tasks proposed in the communiqué. They are angrily denouncing the heinous crimes of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his local agents. The Standing Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, along with leaders from the Xinjiang Military Region, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, and the 7335 Unit, led by the Chairman of the Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, Long Shujin, have been visiting factories, mines, villages, pastures, and military farms to explain the communiqué. They are holding various types of study sessions and revolutionary criticism meetings with workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, impoverished herdsmen, and military farmers. They discuss the excellent domestic and international situation, enthusiastically praise the great victories of the Cultural Revolution, and denounce the treasonous crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices. They also seriously discuss measures to implement the great battle tasks proposed in the plenary session.

The communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Twelfth Session has greatly inspired the 500,000 workers of various ethnic groups in Xinjiang. They have universally established Mao Zedong Thought study classes to learn the communiqué and implement the various battle tasks proposed in the plenary session. They have launched a new high tide of revolutionary criticism in front of the steel furnaces, beside the weaving machines, and on the construction sites. Workers of various ethnic groups have resolutely declared that they will forever follow Chairman Mao, remain steadfast even if the seas dry up and the rocks crumble. They will definitely carry out the requirements of the communiqué, earnestly implement the struggle, criticism, and transformation, achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, turn Xinjiang into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought, and build Xinjiang into an impregnable steel wall against imperialism and revisionism. Workers from the Xinjiang No. 1 Steel Plant and the Urumqi Automobile Repair Factory have established Mao Zedong Thought study classes to implement the battle tasks proposed in the plenary session immediately after the communiqué was issued. They also established revolutionary committees on the 9th, achieving the three-in-one combination of revolution.

The publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Twelfth Session has pushed the revolutionary criticism of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi in the vast rural and pastoral areas of North and South Tian Shan to a new high tide. Farmers and herdsmen of various ethnic groups say: The decision of the Eighth Plenum of the Twelfth Session to expel the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi from the Party and revoke all his positions within and outside the Party is truly satisfying. In the southern Xinjiang regions of Kashgar, Aksu, and Hotan, where the Uygur people reside, the poor and lower-middle peasants angrily denounced Liu Shaoqi's dissemination of the so-called "inappropriate cooperative movement in minority regions," aiming to sabotage the socialist path of minority nationalities. The Uygur poor and lower-middle peasants of the Seman Commune in Shufu County reviewed Chairman Mao's comments in the 1955 investigation report on the Seman District's cooperative society. Great Leader Chairman Mao highly praised the enthusiasm of Uygur farmers for the cooperative path in his comments. They said, Chairman Mao is the great savior of all ethnic groups. It is Chairman Mao who guided us Uygur poor and lower-middle peasants to persist on the socialist path, giving us today's happy life. Liu Shaoqi, this traitor, openly opposed Chairman Mao, claiming that cooperation cannot be implemented among minority nationalities. His wolfish ambition is to make minority nationalities take the capitalist path, allowing the Bai (landlords, rich peasants) to ride on our poor and lower-middle peasants again. We will never agree to this! The Tajik, Kyrgyz, and Kazakh herdsmen living on the Pamir Plateau and Altay Grassland angrily denounced Liu Shaoqi's dissemination of the reactionary fallacy of "no division, no struggle, no class distinction" in pastoral areas. They said: The friend of a wolf is still a wolf. Liu Shaoqi is just like the herdsmen who oppressed and exploited us, both are wolves that devour people. He implemented the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in pastoral areas to protect those herdsmen who whipped us, making us forget the deep hatred against the old society and class struggle, so that he can restore capitalism. We must remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle" and continue to thoroughly criticize and expose the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies spread by Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices in pastoral areas.

Soldiers of Chairman Mao listen to the Party's words the most. The broad masses of soldiers in Xinjiang have taken the serious study of the communiqué, enthusiastic promotion of the communiqué, resolute implementation of the communiqué, and brave defense of the communiqué as the top political task at present. Soldiers of a model station at an altitude of over 4,700 meters on the Karakoram Mountains said: We are on the snow mountains, looking at Beijing, facing the red sun, and thinking of the whole world. We will resolutely respond to the battle call of the communiqué. We must be highly vigilant against the wolf-like nature of American imperialism and the Soviet revisionist traitor clique. If the enemy dares to invade, we will definitely annihilate it completely. After the communiqué was issued, the Xinjiang troops sent tens of thousands of cadres and soldiers every day, carrying the communiqué, climbing mountains and crossing rivers, and entering factories, villages, pastures, and streets to promote it. The broad masses of military farmers established tens of thousands of promotion teams and small squads, promoting the communiqué in the fields, workshops, and courtyards, and holding various forms of criticism meetings with the revolutionary masses to denounce the counter-revolutionary crimes of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his agents. They resolutely declared that they, the military farmers loyal to Chairman Mao, will definitely earnestly implement the various battle tasks proposed in the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Twelfth Session and achieve new merits for the people in the struggle for a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

　　在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报鼓舞下
　　新疆军民掀起革命大批判新高潮
　　广大牧民说：刘少奇和压迫剥削我们的牧主一样，都是吃人的豺狼
    据新华社乌鲁木齐十一日电　战斗在反帝、反修斗争最前哨的新疆维吾尔自治区十三个民族的广大人民群众和驻疆部队指战员，在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报鼓舞下，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，正在掀起一个革命大批判的新高潮。
    目前，从喀喇昆仑山麓到阿尔泰风雪草原，从哈密绿洲到伊犁河谷，各个工厂、村落，每一处帐篷、哨所，革命群众和解放军指战员都在认真落实公报提出的各项伟大战斗任务，都在愤怒声讨叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其在本地区代理人的滔天罪行。新疆维吾尔自治区革命委员会的常委，新疆军区、新疆军区生产建设兵团和七三三五部队的负责同志，在自治区革委会主任龙书金同志的带领下，连日来分别深入厂矿企业、农村、牧场和军垦农场宣讲公报，和各族工人、贫下中农、贫苦牧民、军垦战士一起，开各种类型的学习座谈会和革命大批判会。他们在会上畅谈国内外的一派大好形势，热情歌颂无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，热情歌颂各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席，愤怒声讨帝国主义、现代修正主义和国民党反动派的走狗刘少奇及其同伙叛党叛国的罪行，并认真讨论了落实全会提出的各项伟大战斗任务的措施。
    党的八届十二中全会公报，极大地鼓舞了新疆五十万各族产业工人。他们普遍开办了学习公报和落实全会提出的各项战斗任务的毛泽东思想学习班，并且在炼钢炉前、织布机旁、建筑工地上掀起了革命大批判的新高潮。各族工人坚决表示，永远紧跟毛主席，海枯石烂不变心，一定要按照公报的要求，认真搞好斗、批、改，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，把新疆办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校，把新疆建成坚不可摧的反帝、反修的钢铁长城。新疆八一钢铁厂和乌鲁木齐汽车修配厂的各族工人，在公报发表后，立即办起了落实全会提出的战斗任务的毛泽东思想学习班，并在九日同时成立了革命委员会，实现了革命的三结合。
    党的八届十二中全会公报的发表，把天山南北广大农村和牧区对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的革命大批判推向了一个新的高潮。各族农民、牧民说：党的八届十二中全会决定把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党，并撤消其党内外一切职务，真是大快人心。在新疆南部维吾尔族聚居的喀什、阿克苏、和田等专区，广大维吾尔族贫下中农在批判会上愤怒地控诉了刘少奇散布的所谓在少数民族地区不适合搞合作化运动，妄图破坏少数民族走社会主义道路的反革命罪行。疏附县色满公社的维吾尔族贫下中农，在批判会上重温了毛主席在一九五五年为色满公社的前身色满区举办合作社的调查报告中所写的按语。伟大领袖毛主席在按语中高度赞扬了维吾尔族农民走合作化道路的积极性。他们说，毛主席是各族人民的大救星，正是毛主席指引我们维吾尔族贫下中农坚持走社会主义道路，我们才有今天的幸福日子。而刘少奇这个叛徒公然对抗毛主席，胡说什么在少数民族中不能实行合作化，他的狼子野心就是要少数民族走资本主义道路，让巴衣（地主、富农）重新骑在我们贫下中农头上，我们一千个、一万个不答应！居住在帕米尔高原和阿尔泰草原的塔吉克族、柯尔克孜族和哈萨克族广大牧民，以无比愤怒的心情，纷纷在牧场和毡房里召开声讨大会，狠批刘少奇散布的在牧区“不分不斗，不划阶级”的反动谬论。他们说：狼的朋友还是狼。刘少奇和压迫剥削我们的牧主一样，都是吃人的豺狼。他在牧区推行反革命修正主义路线，就是要保护那些用鞭子抽打过我们的牧主，要我们忘记对旧社会的深仇大恨，忘记阶级斗争，好让他复辟资本主义。我们一定要牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，继续把刘少奇及其同伙在牧区所散布的反革命修正主义谬论彻底批倒批臭。
    毛主席的战士最听党的话。驻新疆部队广大指战员，把认真学习公报、热情宣传公报、坚决执行公报、勇敢捍卫公报，作为当前头等重要的政治任务。驻守在拔海四千七百多米的喀喇昆仑山的某部四好站的边防战士说：我们身在雪山上，眼望北京城，心向红太阳，胸怀全世界。我们坚决响应公报的战斗号召，对于豺狼成性的美帝国主义和苏修叛徒集团，一定要百倍提高警惕。如果敌人胆敢来犯，我们就把它坚决、彻底、干净、全部地消灭之。公报发表后，驻疆部队每天都派出上万名干部、战士，带着公报，爬山涉水，深入工厂、农村、牧区和街道进行宣传。广大军垦战士建立起成千上万个宣传小组和小分队，在田头、车间、院落热情宣传公报，并且和广大革命群众一起举行各种形式的批判会，声讨叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其代理人的反革命罪行。他们坚决表示，永远忠于毛主席的军垦战士，一定要认真贯彻执行八届十二中全会公报提出的各项战斗任务，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的战斗中为人民立新功。
