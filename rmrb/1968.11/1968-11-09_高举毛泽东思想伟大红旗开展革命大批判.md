Workers of Wuhan's Fourth Cotton Textile Mill and Stationed Soldiers Denounce Liu Shaoqi's Heinous Crimes with Ironclad Facts

Workers say that when the traitor Liu Shaoqi came to our mill for an "inspection," he hated the workers so much and was so close to the capitalists, proving that he is a genuine loyal dog of the bourgeoisie and our class enemy! Expelling the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi from the party forever is exactly what we workers want.

On the joyous day when the communiqué of the enlarged 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee, chaired by Chairman Mao, was issued, the revolutionary workers of Wuhan's Fourth Cotton Textile Mill (formerly Yuhua Spinning Mill) and the comrades of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the mill responded resolutely to the great call of the plenary session. They immediately launched a powerful wave of revolutionary criticism. Armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, they exposed the numerous crimes committed by the loyal dog of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, Liu Shaoqi, at this mill. They thoroughly criticized the reactionary and counter-revolutionary revisionist trash he peddled, making it stink to high heaven. The workers and soldiers became more enraged and more energetic with each revelation and criticism, repeatedly raising their fists and shouting, "Firmly overthrow the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi!" "Firmly support expelling Liu Shaoqi from the party forever and revoking all his party and non-party positions!" "Long live the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand, ten thousand years!"

Below are excerpts from the speeches of some comrades at a criticism meeting.

Liu Shaoqi is the class enemy of the workers and a running dog of the bourgeoisie

Shen Guirong (old worker from the fine spinning workshop):

The 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee decided to expel the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi from the party forever and revoke all his party and non-party positions, announcing his complete downfall. This is a great relief and exactly what we workers want. We firmly support this decision.

Chairman Mao teaches us, "There is no such thing as love without cause, nor hatred without cause." From Liu Shaoqi's visit to our mill in 1956, when he showed such hatred towards the workers and such closeness to the capitalists, we can clearly see that the traitor Liu Shaoqi is not a member of the proletariat. He is a loyal running dog of the bourgeoisie!

That winter, when the socialist transformation of capitalism and industry was deeply underway nationwide, and when the proletariat was engaged in a life-and-death struggle against the bourgeoisie, this big bastard Liu Shaoqi, along with his wife, came to our mill for a so-called "inspection." I, representing all the workers of the mill, went to see this "big shot." He sat in a chair, crossed his legs like a judge, and asked me two questions. Before I could answer, he immediately changed the subject and eagerly wanted to see the capitalists, quickly summoning the biggest capitalist in the mill. As soon as this capitalist entered the room, the traitor Liu Shaoqi greeted him like a long-lost friend, smiling broadly, bowing, shaking hands, pouring tea, and offering cigarettes. He sat shoulder to shoulder with the capitalist, asking about the capitalist's past and present, and about the capitalist's personal life and family. When the capitalist mentioned receiving a monthly salary of over 130 yuan and an annual dividend of over 10,000 yuan, the traitor Liu Shaoqi repeatedly asked, "Isn't that enough?" "Isn't that enough?" Look! How warm and considerate Liu Shaoqi was towards the capitalists! But towards us workers, this big traitor showed nothing but deep hatred. At that time, many workers in our mill heard that this "big shot" had come, and out of love for the party, they all wanted to see him. But he ordered the doors and windows to be shut tight, refusing to see anyone. After he and the capitalist had finished their conversation, he pulled his hat down low, raised his collar high, and covered his face with a large white mask. He hurriedly slipped out of the mill.

From Liu Shaoqi's completely different attitudes towards workers and capitalists in just three hours, it is clear which class he belongs to! Thinking back to that situation, all the workers in our mill were extremely indignant. Liu Shaoqi and the capitalists were in perfect harmony, breathing through the same nostrils. He was a genuine running dog of the bourgeoisie!

Yuan Juying (retired old worker):

When the traitor Liu Shaoqi came to our mill for a so-called "inspection," on one hand, he spoke up for the capitalists, saying that they were "oppressed" in the past. On the other hand, he sang praises for the capitalists' exploitation of workers, boasting that the capitalists "were able to run the mill through hardships and twists and turns." In the dark old society, who was oppressed and exploited? It was the working class. My past experiences are a powerful testament to this. At the age of eight, I was sold as a child bride, and soon after, I started working in the mill. I suffered greatly from the capitalists' exploitation and oppression. In the old society, to work in the mill, one had to find a guarantor, and during festivals, one had to give the capitalists and feudal foremen silk stockings, satin shoes, and old hens. Because I couldn't afford these things, I was fired three times. Even when I managed to keep my job, enduring beatings, scoldings, and humiliation was a daily occurrence. Once, when I was sick and my movements were a bit slow while picking up yarn, the feudal foreman saw this and slapped me, making my eyes flash. Even so, every day I worked to the point of exhaustion, but my family still couldn't open the pot, worrying about the next meal, and the next day. It was Chairman Mao, the great savior, who rescued us from the sea of suffering. We became the masters of the state and the mill. From the bottom of our hearts, we shout ten thousand times, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand, ten thousand years!"

Under the leadership of the working class, our mill has undergone a tremendous transformation. From the few broken machines that could only spin yarn in the past, we have developed to today's complete set of equipment that can spin yarn and weave cloth. Production has increased several times, and quality has significantly improved. Ironclad facts prove that the wealth of the mill has always been created by the working class. We revolutionary workers are the masters of the mill. Chairman Mao respects us workers the most and trusts us the most, saying, "The working class must lead everything." Chairman Mao supports us, and we must make him proud. We must lead everything, and we are fully capable of leading everything. What about the capitalists? Before liberation, they relied on the power of the Kuomintang reactionaries to drink our workers' blood. After liberation, they still eat the bread of exploitation. Take the biggest capitalist in our mill, whom the traitor Liu Shaoqi praised as having "merits in running the mill." In the summer, he would go to Shanghai to escape the heat, and in the winter, he would go to Guangzhou to avoid the cold. He received a high salary and was plotting to restore capitalism. I want to ask Liu Shaoqi: Who oppressed the capitalists in the past? What merits did they have in running the mill? This is truly turning right into wrong and lying with one's eyes open.

Liu Shaoqi is the executioner of socialism and the vanguard of restoring capitalism

Xiong Guiyang (worker, member of the revolutionary committee), Liu Dunqing (revolutionary cadre of worker origin), Zhang Xiufeng (revolutionary cadre):

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out profoundly: "Socialism is a fairly long historical stage. In this historical stage of socialism, there still exist classes, class contradictions, and class struggle, there exist the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism, and there exists the danger of capitalist restoration."

After the great traitor Liu Shaoqi came to Wuhan, he came to our mill for an "inspection" to carry out activities to restore capitalism. Our mill was the Yuhua Spinning Mill before liberation, operated by the "Yuhua Textile Shareholding Company." This company had a lot of capital, not only in Wuhan but also in Chongqing, Chengdu, Xi'an, Shijiazhuang, Shanghai, and other places. After Liu Shaoqi came to our mill, he immediately became close with the biggest capitalist in the mill, boosting their morale and shamelessly saying, "You have experience in running mills, we should learn from you." He attempted to let the capitalists seize the leadership of the mill and restore capitalism. Liu Shaoqi also said that we should learn from the Soviet revisionists. In short, he used all his strength to try to turn our mill into a stronghold for restoring capitalism. The capitalist-roaders in the mill understood Liu Shaoqi's scheme to restore capitalism and immediately raised the salaries of the big capitalists. Soon, they promoted a landlord element to be the deputy director and promoted some traitors, spies, bourgeois reactionary "technical authorities," and capitalists to be chief and deputy chief engineers and many important department heads. Some capitalists even joined the union and became "people's representatives." They recruited traitors and colluded with each other, seizing the power of the party, government, finance, and culture in the mill, and carried out counter-revolutionary activities. They opposed emphasizing proletarian politics; they advocated "technical first," "material incentives," and "profit first" capitalist management methods. They secretly set up "small warehouses," hid from the state, and squandered and wasted extensively, living a decadent bourgeois life. They talked to the workers about money, money, money, and rewards, rewards, rewards, trying to lead the workers astray to pursue personal material interests.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we responded to Chairman Mao's great call and seized back the power that the capitalist-roaders in the mill had usurped. Now, the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee has unanimously passed a resolution to expel Liu Shaoqi from the party forever and revoke all his party and non-party positions. This announces the complete failure of Liu Shaoqi and his gang of counter-revolutionary plots, greatly boosting the morale of the proletariat and smashing the arrogance of the bourgeoisie. This is great! This is excellent!

Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and Thoroughly Settle Accounts with Liu Shaoqi's Counter-Revolutionary Crimes

Yuan Guangchun (worker, deputy director of the revolutionary committee):

Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin teaches us: Chairman Mao is the highest leader of our party, and Mao Zedong Thought is the eternal universal truth. Anyone who opposes Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, the whole party will exterminate them, and the whole nation will condemn them.

The traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi, with his black hands directly reaching into our mill, committed a series of counter-revolutionary activities, which can be summed up in one point: he fiercely opposed Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. During the three-hour "inspection," he did not mention Chairman Mao or Mao Zedong Thought at all but peddled his black "Self-Cultivation" instead. Under the traitor Liu Shaoqi's instructions, his agent in our mill soon bought a large batch of black "Self-Cultivation" books, giving one to each party member. This is the opium that corrupts people's revolutionary will! Their evil purpose is to try to make party members cultivate themselves in seclusion, not to revolutionize, not to engage in class struggle, not to have proletarian dictatorship, and to become their tame tools for restoring capitalism.

"The great ship sails with the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Whoever opposes Chairman Mao, we will overthrow them! Whoever opposes Mao Zedong Thought, we will overthrow them! The revolutionary masses exposed Liu Shaoqi, this big capitalist-roader, relying on Mao Zedong Thought; today, to further deepen the revolutionary criticism, we must also rely on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We workers are closest to Chairman Mao, follow Chairman Mao the most closely, and are most loyal to Chairman Mao. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and launch a more extensive and in-depth revolutionary criticism movement. We must thoroughly expose all class enemies sheltered by Liu Shaoqi, fight them down, and stink them up, and seize the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Deng Guangxue, Meng Qingzhu (members of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the mill):

Our great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is completely necessary and very timely for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist restoration, and building socialism." The sharp struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines experienced by Wuhan's Fourth Cotton Textile Mill fully proves the correctness of Chairman Mao's statement. The communiqué of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee is brilliantly illuminated by Mao Zedong Thought and is the great program for achieving the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must ride the mighty east wind of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, and launch a more extensive and in-depth revolutionary criticism movement. We must thoroughly sweep away the reactionary revisionist thoughts of Liu Shaoqi and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the mill. In this great struggle, we, the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the mill, vow to be the strong backing of all revolutionary workers in the mill and ensure the implementation of Chairman Mao's brilliant directive that the working class must lead everything. Let the invincible Mao Zedong Thought forever occupy this mill.

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗开展革命大批判
    武汉第四棉纺织厂工人和驻厂解放军用铁的事实愤怒声讨刘少奇的滔天罪行
    工人们说，工贼刘少奇来我厂“视察”时，对工人那样恨，对资本家那样亲，完全是货真价实的资产阶级的忠实走狗！是我们工人阶级的死敌！把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党，正合我们工人阶级的心意
    在毛主席亲自主持召开的党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表的大喜日子里，武汉市第四棉纺织厂（原裕华纱厂）的广大革命工人和驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的同志，坚决响应全会发出的伟大号召，闻风而动，掀起了声势浩大的革命大批判的新高潮。他们以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，清算了帝国主义、现代修正主义和国民党反动派的忠实走狗刘少奇在这个厂犯下的累累罪行；把他贩卖的一套反动透顶的反革命修正主义破烂货，批得臭不可闻。工人和解放军同志越揭越愤怒，越批越有劲，不断地振臂高呼：“坚决打倒叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇！”“坚决拥护把刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外一切职务！”“无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利万岁！”“毛主席万岁，万万岁！”
    下面是这个厂的一部分同志在一次批判会上的发言摘要。
    刘少奇是工人阶级的死敌、资产阶级的走狗
    沈桂英（细纱车间老工人）：
    党的八届十二中全会，决定把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党，并撤消其党内外一切职务，宣告了他的彻底垮台，真是大快人心，正合我们工人阶级的心愿，我们最坚决地拥护。
    毛主席教导我们说：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”我们从刘少奇一九五六年来我们厂“视察”时对工人那样仇恨，对资本家那样亲，就完全可以看出工贼刘少奇根本不是无产阶级的人，他是资产阶级的一条忠实走狗！
    那一年冬天，正当全国资本主义工商业的社会主义改造深入开展的时候，也正是无产阶级向资产阶级进行你死我活的斗争的关键时刻，刘少奇这个大坏蛋，带着他的老婆，来我们厂进行了三小时的所谓“视察”。我代表全厂工人先去见这位“大人物”。他坐在椅子上，翘起二郎腿，象审判官一样地问了我两句话，还没等回答，就马上转了话题，迫不及待地要见资本家，把厂里最大的资本家给请来了。这个资本家刚一跨进门，工贼刘少奇就象见到亲人一样，对他满脸堆笑，又躬身，又握手，又倒茶，又递烟，拉着这个资本家肩并肩地坐在沙发上，从资本家的过去问到资本家的现在，从资本家的个人问到资本家的全家。当资本家说到每月能拿工资一百三十多元，一年能拿定息一万多元时，工贼刘少奇还一再关心地问道：“不够用吧？”“不够用吧？”看！刘少奇对资本家是何等亲热和关怀备至呵！可是，这个大工贼对我们工人却是百般仇恨。当时，我们厂里许多工人听说这位“大人物”来了，出于对党的热爱，都想去见一见他，可是他却叫把门窗关得死死的，一个都不见。等他和资本家一唱一和，把话谈够了，他把帽子拉得低低的，把大衣领提得高高的，把白口罩戴得大大的，匆匆忙忙地溜出了工厂。
    从刘少奇这个大坏蛋三小时中对工人和资本家两种截然不同的态度里，他究竟是那一个阶级的人，不是看得一清二楚了吗！回想当时的情况，我们全厂工人真是无比愤慨，刘少奇这个家伙，和资本家心心相印，一个鼻孔出气，完全是个货真价实的资产阶级的走狗！
    袁菊英（退休老工人）：
    工贼刘少奇到我们厂进行所谓“视察”时，一方面为资本家鸣冤叫屈，胡说什么资本家在过去也是“受压迫的”呀，同时又为资本家剥削工人大唱赞歌，吹捧资本家“能把厂子办得这个样子，是经过一番艰难曲折的”。在黑暗的旧社会，受压迫、受剥削的是谁？是工人阶级。我过去的一段遭遇，就是有力的见证。我八岁当童养媳，不久进厂做工，吃尽了资本家剥削、压迫的苦头。旧社会做工，进厂要请保，逢年过节还要给资本家、封建把头送丝光袜、缎子鞋、老母鸡。我因为送不起这些东西，先后被开除过三次。就是一时勉强保住了饭碗，挨打挨骂受气，也是家常便饭。一次我生病，接纱头动作慢了一点，封建把头看到后就是一巴掌，打得我两眼发花。就是这样，每天做得死去活来，家里还是照样揭不开锅，吃了上顿愁下顿，吃了今天愁明天。是大救星毛主席把我们从苦海中救了出来，我们成了国家和工厂的主人。我们从心坎里千万遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    在我们工人阶级的领导下，我们厂的面貌发生了翻天覆地的变化。由过去只能纺纱的几台破机器，发展到今天有了能纺纱能织布的成套设备，生产成倍增长，质量显著提高。铁的事实证明，工厂的财富从来就是我们工人阶级创造的，我们革命工人是工厂的主人。毛主席最尊重我们工人，最相信我们工人，说“工人阶级必须领导一切”，毛主席为我们撑腰，我们要为毛主席争气，我们就是要领导一切，我们完全能够领导一切。资本家呢？解放前仗着国民党反动派的势力，喝我们工人的血。解放后，仍然吃的是剥削饭。就拿我们厂那个被工贼刘少奇称赞为“办厂有功”的最大的资本家来说，夏天他跑到上海去度暑，冬天他赶到广州去避寒，拿着高工资，搞的是复辟资本主义。我要质问刘少奇：资本家过去受谁的压迫？“办厂有功”，功在哪里？真是颠倒是非，睁着眼睛说瞎话。
    刘少奇是扼杀社会主义的刽子手、复辟资本主义的急先锋
    熊贵扬（工人，厂革委会工作人员）、刘敦卿（工人出身的革命干部）、张秀峰（革命干部）：
    我们伟大领袖毛主席深刻地指出：“社会主义社会是一个相当长的历史阶段。在社会主义这个历史阶段中，还存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，存在着资本主义复辟的危险性。”
    大叛徒刘少奇到武汉后，来我们厂“视察”，就是为了搞资本主义复辟活动。我们厂就是解放前的裕华纱厂，是“裕华纺织股份有限公司”开办的。这个公司的资本家钱多，不仅武汉有厂，在重庆、成都、西安、石家庄、上海等地也有厂。刘少奇来到我们厂后，就和厂里最大的资本家打得火热，给资本家撑腰打气，厚颜无耻地说什么“你们办厂是有经验的，我们要向你们学习”呀，妄图让资本家篡夺工厂的领导大权，放手复辟资本主义。刘少奇还说什么要向苏修学习。总之，他使尽了力量要把我们厂变成复辟资本主义的一个据点。厂里的走资派对刘少奇复辟资本主义的一套心领神会，马上给大资本家提了薪，不久，又提拔一个地主分子当副厂长，提拔一些叛徒、特务、资产阶级反动技术“权威”和资本家当正副总工程师以及许多重要科室的科长。有的资本家还加入了工会，当上了“人民代表”。他们就是这样招降纳叛，结党营私，篡夺了工厂里的党、政、财、文大权，大搞反革命的勾当。他们反对突出无产阶级政治；大搞“技术挂帅”、“物质刺激”、“利润第一”的资本主义管理方法；他们私设“小仓库”，向国家打埋伏，大肆挥霍浪费，过着资产阶级的腐朽生活。他们对工人开口闭口就是：钱、钱、钱，奖、奖、奖，妄图把工人引上追求个人物质利益的邪路。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们响应毛主席的伟大号召，从厂里走资派手中把他们窃踞的那部分权力夺了回来。现在，党的八届十二中全会一致通过决议，把刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外一切职务。这宣告了刘少奇及其大小娄罗们反革命阴谋的彻底破产，大长了我们无产阶级的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风。真是好得很！好极了！
    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗  彻底清算刘少奇的反革命罪行
    袁光春（工人、厂革命委员会副主任）：
    毛主席的亲密战友林副主席教导我们说：毛主席是我们党的最高领袖，毛泽东思想是永远的普遍真理。谁反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，全党共诛之，全国共讨之。
    叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇，把黑手直接伸进我们厂所干的一系列反革命勾当，集中到一点，就是疯狂地反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。在三小时的“视察”过程中，他闭口不提毛主席，只字不谈毛泽东思想，却拚命地兜售他的黑《修养》。在工贼刘少奇的示意下，他在我们厂的代理人，不久就买回了一大堆黑《修养》，给每个党员人手一本。这是腐蚀人们革命意志的鸦片烟！他们的罪恶目的就是妄图使党员闭门修养，不要革命，不要阶级斗争，不要无产阶级专政，成为他们复辟资本主义的驯服工具。
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。谁反对毛主席，我们就打倒谁！谁反对毛泽东思想，我们就打倒谁！革命人民群众揪出刘少奇这个大工贼，靠的是毛泽东思想；今天进一步深入开展革命的大批判，同样要靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想。我们工人阶级对毛主席最亲，跟毛主席最紧，对毛主席最忠，我们就是要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更加广泛深入地开展革命大批判的群众运动，坚决把被刘少奇包庇下来的一切阶级敌人统统挖出来，斗倒斗臭，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    邓光学、孟庆珠（解放军驻厂毛泽东思想宣传队成员）：
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“这次无产阶级文化大革命，对于巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义，是完全必要的，是非常及时的。”武汉市第四棉纺织厂经历的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的尖锐斗争，充分证明了毛主席这一论断的英明和正确。党的八届十二中全会公报，字字句句闪耀着毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大纲领。我们一定要乘八届十二中全会公报的浩荡东风，发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，掀起更加广泛、更加深入的革命大批判的群众运动，彻底肃清刘少奇等党内最大的一小撮走资派的反革命修正主义的思想，认真搞好工厂的斗、批、改。在这场伟大的斗争中，我们驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队，誓作全厂革命工人的坚强后盾，保证毛主席关于工人阶级必须领导一切这一光辉指示的贯彻落实，让战无不胜的毛泽东思想永远占领这个工厂。
