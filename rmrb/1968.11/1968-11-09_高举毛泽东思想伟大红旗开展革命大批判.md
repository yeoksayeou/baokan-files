Workers of Wuhan's Fourth Cotton Textile Mill and Stationed Soldiers Denounce Liu Shaoqi's Heinous Crimes with Ironclad Facts

Workers say that when the traitor Liu Shaoqi came to our mill for an "inspection," he hated the workers so much and was so close to the capitalists, proving that he is a genuine loyal dog of the bourgeoisie and our class enemy! Expelling the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi from the party forever is exactly what we workers want.

On the joyous day when the communiqu√© of the enlarged 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee, chaired by Chairman Mao, was issued, the revolutionary workers of Wuhan's Fourth Cotton Textile Mill (formerly Yuhua Spinning Mill) and the comrades of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the mill responded resolutely to the great call of the plenary session. They immediately launched a powerful wave of revolutionary criticism. Armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, they exposed the numerous crimes committed by the loyal dog of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, Liu Shaoqi, at this mill. They thoroughly criticized the reactionary and counter-revolutionary revisionist trash he peddled, making it stink to high heaven. The workers and soldiers became more enraged and more energetic with each revelation and criticism, repeatedly raising their fists and shouting, "Firmly overthrow the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi!" "Firmly support expelling Liu Shaoqi from the party forever and revoking all his party and non-party positions!" "Long live the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand, ten thousand years!"

Below are excerpts from the speeches of some comrades at a criticism meeting.

Liu Shaoqi is the class enemy of the workers and a running dog of the bourgeoisie

Shen Guirong (old worker from the fine spinning workshop):

The 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee decided to expel the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi from the party forever and revoke all his party and non-party positions, announcing his complete downfall. This is a great relief and exactly what we workers want. We firmly support this decision.

Chairman Mao teaches us, "There is no such thing as love without cause, nor hatred without cause." From Liu Shaoqi's visit to our mill in 1956, when he showed such hatred towards the workers and such closeness to the capitalists, we can clearly see that the traitor Liu Shaoqi is not a member of the proletariat. He is a loyal running dog of the bourgeoisie!

That winter, when the socialist transformation of capitalism and industry was deeply underway nationwide, and when the proletariat was engaged in a life-and-death struggle against the bourgeoisie, this big bastard Liu Shaoqi, along with his wife, came to our mill for a so-called "inspection." I, representing all the workers of the mill, went to see this "big shot." He sat in a chair, crossed his legs like a judge, and asked me two questions. Before I could answer, he immediately changed the subject and eagerly wanted to see the capitalists, quickly summoning the biggest capitalist in the mill. As soon as this capitalist entered the room, the traitor Liu Shaoqi greeted him like a long-lost friend, smiling broadly, bowing, shaking hands, pouring tea, and offering cigarettes. He sat shoulder to shoulder with the capitalist, asking about the capitalist's past and present, and about the capitalist's personal life and family. When the capitalist mentioned receiving a monthly salary of over 130 yuan and an annual dividend of over 10,000 yuan, the traitor Liu Shaoqi repeatedly asked, "Isn't that enough?" "Isn't that enough?" Look! How warm and considerate Liu Shaoqi was towards the capitalists! But towards us workers, this big traitor showed nothing but deep hatred. At that time, many workers in our mill heard that this "big shot" had come, and out of love for the party, they all wanted to see him. But he ordered the doors and windows to be shut tight, refusing to see anyone. After he and the capitalist had finished their conversation, he pulled his hat down low, raised his collar high, and covered his face with a large white mask. He hurriedly slipped out of the mill.

From Liu Shaoqi's completely different attitudes towards workers and capitalists in just three hours, it is clear which class he belongs to! Thinking back to that situation, all the workers in our mill were extremely indignant. Liu Shaoqi and the capitalists were in perfect harmony, breathing through the same nostrils. He was a genuine running dog of the bourgeoisie!

Yuan Juying (retired old worker):

When the traitor Liu Shaoqi came to our mill for a so-called "inspection," on one hand, he spoke up for the capitalists, saying that they were "oppressed" in the past. On the other hand, he sang praises for the capitalists' exploitation of workers, boasting that the capitalists "were able to run the mill through hardships and twists and turns." In the dark old society, who was oppressed and exploited? It was the working class. My past experiences are a powerful testament to this. At the age of eight, I was sold as a child bride, and soon after, I started working in the mill. I suffered greatly from the capitalists' exploitation and oppression. In the old society, to work in the mill, one had to find a guarantor, and during festivals, one had to give the capitalists and feudal foremen silk stockings, satin shoes, and old hens. Because I couldn't afford these things, I was fired three times. Even when I managed to keep my job, enduring beatings, scoldings, and humiliation was a daily occurrence. Once, when I was sick and my movements were a bit slow while picking up yarn, the feudal foreman saw this and slapped me, making my eyes flash. Even so, every day I worked to the point of exhaustion, but my family still couldn't open the pot, worrying about the next meal, and the next day. It was Chairman Mao, the great savior, who rescued us from the sea of suffering. We became the masters of the state and the mill. From the bottom of our hearts, we shout ten thousand times, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand, ten thousand years!"

Under the leadership of the working class, our mill has undergone a tremendous transformation. From the few broken machines that could only spin yarn in the past, we have developed to today's complete set of equipment that can spin yarn and weave cloth. Production has increased several times, and quality has significantly improved. Ironclad facts prove that the wealth of the mill has always been created by the working class. We revolutionary workers are the masters of the mill. Chairman Mao respects us workers the most and trusts us the most, saying, "The working class must lead everything." Chairman Mao supports us, and we must make him proud. We must lead everything, and we are fully capable of leading everything. What about the capitalists? Before liberation, they relied on the power of the Kuomintang reactionaries to drink our workers' blood. After liberation, they still eat the bread of exploitation. Take the biggest capitalist in our mill, whom the traitor Liu Shaoqi praised as having "merits in running the mill." In the summer, he would go to Shanghai to escape the heat, and in the winter, he would go to Guangzhou to avoid the cold. He received a high salary and was plotting to restore capitalism. I want to ask Liu Shaoqi: Who oppressed the capitalists in the past? What merits did they have in running the mill? This is truly turning right into wrong and lying with one's eyes open.

Liu Shaoqi is the executioner of socialism and the vanguard of restoring capitalism

Xiong Guiyang (worker, member of the revolutionary committee), Liu Dunqing (revolutionary cadre of worker origin), Zhang Xiufeng (revolutionary cadre):

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out profoundly: "Socialism is a fairly long historical stage. In this historical stage of socialism, there still exist classes, class contradictions, and class struggle, there exist the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism, and there exists the danger of capitalist restoration."

After the great traitor Liu Shaoqi came to Wuhan, he came to our mill for an "inspection" to carry out activities to restore capitalism. Our mill was the Yuhua Spinning Mill before liberation, operated by the "Yuhua Textile Shareholding Company." This company had a lot of capital, not only in Wuhan but also in Chongqing, Chengdu, Xi'an, Shijiazhuang, Shanghai, and other places. After Liu Shaoqi came to our mill, he immediately became close with the biggest capitalist in the mill, boosting their morale and shamelessly saying, "You have experience in running mills, we should learn from you." He attempted to let the capitalists seize the leadership of the mill and restore capitalism. Liu Shaoqi also said that we should learn from the Soviet revisionists. In short, he used all his strength to try to turn our mill into a stronghold for restoring capitalism. The capitalist-roaders in the mill understood Liu Shaoqi's scheme to restore capitalism and immediately raised the salaries of the big capitalists. Soon, they promoted a landlord element to be the deputy director and promoted some traitors, spies, bourgeois reactionary "technical authorities," and capitalists to be chief and deputy chief engineers and many important department heads. Some capitalists even joined the union and became "people's representatives." They recruited traitors and colluded with each other, seizing the power of the party, government, finance, and culture in the mill, and carried out counter-revolutionary activities. They opposed emphasizing proletarian politics; they advocated "technical first," "material incentives," and "profit first" capitalist management methods. They secretly set up "small warehouses," hid from the state, and squandered and wasted extensively, living a decadent bourgeois life. They talked to the workers about money, money, money, and rewards, rewards, rewards, trying to lead the workers astray to pursue personal material interests.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we responded to Chairman Mao's great call and seized back the power that the capitalist-roaders in the mill had usurped. Now, the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee has unanimously passed a resolution to expel Liu Shaoqi from the party forever and revoke all his party and non-party positions. This announces the complete failure of Liu Shaoqi and his gang of counter-revolutionary plots, greatly boosting the morale of the proletariat and smashing the arrogance of the bourgeoisie. This is great! This is excellent!

Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and Thoroughly Settle Accounts with Liu Shaoqi's Counter-Revolutionary Crimes

Yuan Guangchun (worker, deputy director of the revolutionary committee):

Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin teaches us: Chairman Mao is the highest leader of our party, and Mao Zedong Thought is the eternal universal truth. Anyone who opposes Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, the whole party will exterminate them, and the whole nation will condemn them.

The traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi, with his black hands directly reaching into our mill, committed a series of counter-revolutionary activities, which can be summed up in one point: he fiercely opposed Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. During the three-hour "inspection," he did not mention Chairman Mao or Mao Zedong Thought at all but peddled his black "Self-Cultivation" instead. Under the traitor Liu Shaoqi's instructions, his agent in our mill soon bought a large batch of black "Self-Cultivation" books, giving one to each party member. This is the opium that corrupts people's revolutionary will! Their evil purpose is to try to make party members cultivate themselves in seclusion, not to revolutionize, not to engage in class struggle, not to have proletarian dictatorship, and to become their tame tools for restoring capitalism.

"The great ship sails with the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Whoever opposes Chairman Mao, we will overthrow them! Whoever opposes Mao Zedong Thought, we will overthrow them! The revolutionary masses exposed Liu Shaoqi, this big capitalist-roader, relying on Mao Zedong Thought; today, to further deepen the revolutionary criticism, we must also rely on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We workers are closest to Chairman Mao, follow Chairman Mao the most closely, and are most loyal to Chairman Mao. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and launch a more extensive and in-depth revolutionary criticism movement. We must thoroughly expose all class enemies sheltered by Liu Shaoqi, fight them down, and stink them up, and seize the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Deng Guangxue, Meng Qingzhu (members of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the mill):

Our great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is completely necessary and very timely for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist restoration, and building socialism." The sharp struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines experienced by Wuhan's Fourth Cotton Textile Mill fully proves the correctness of Chairman Mao's statement. The communiqu√© of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee is brilliantly illuminated by Mao Zedong Thought and is the great program for achieving the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must ride the mighty east wind of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, and launch a more extensive and in-depth revolutionary criticism movement. We must thoroughly sweep away the reactionary revisionist thoughts of Liu Shaoqi and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the mill. In this great struggle, we, the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the mill, vow to be the strong backing of all revolutionary workers in the mill and ensure the implementation of Chairman Mao's brilliant directive that the working class must lead everything. Let the invincible Mao Zedong Thought forever occupy this mill.
