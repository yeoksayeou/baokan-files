Inspired by the great leader Chairman Mao's latest directive that intellectuals must receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, more than ten thousand graduates from colleges and universities in Tianjin in 1966 and 1967 have rushed to rural areas, border regions, factories, and grassroots levels to engage in labor and receive re-education from workers and peasants, taking the path of unity with workers and peasants.

Before taking up their labor posts, these college and university graduates held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, seriously studying Chairman Mao's series of latest directives and his brilliant "Three Articles," summarizing the tempering and experience gained in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past two years, severely criticizing the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies such as the "theory of merging public and private interests" and the "theory of reading books to become officials," and conducting "remembering bitterness and thinking of sweetness" activities. The graduates expressed their determination to resolutely take the path of unity with workers and peasants, thoroughly transform their worldview, and temper themselves into successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, November 13: More than six thousand graduates from colleges and universities in Hebei Province in 1967, following the great leader Chairman Mao's directive that intellectuals should receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, with revolutionary zeal, have all rushed to rural areas, factories, and grassroots units to engage in labor and work, taking the revolutionary path of unity with workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams stationed at various colleges and universities and the People's Liberation Army held Mao Zedong Thought study classes for the graduates before they went down. In the study classes, they enthusiastically carried out the "three loyalties" activity of being loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, severely criticizing the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, greatly raising the class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad masses of graduates. The graduates expressed their determination to, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's series of latest directives, sincerely receive re-education from workers, peasants, and soldiers, temper themselves in the great storms of class struggle, and strive to cultivate themselves into reliable successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, November 13: High school and junior high school graduates in Jiangsu Province in 1966 and 1967, with unwavering loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, resolutely took the path of unity with workers and peasants as guided by Chairman Mao. By the end of October, more than fifty thousand high school and junior high school graduates had gone to rural people's communes to work in production teams. Additionally, more than two hundred forty thousand revolutionary youth who live in rural areas have returned to their production teams to engage in labor. They are determined to humbly receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants in rural areas and grow through the three great revolutionary movements.

Before the broad masses of high school and junior high school graduates went down to the countryside, various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes were held everywhere. Through studying Chairman Mao's series of directives on educational revolution, recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, severely criticizing the great traitor Liu Shaoqi and his agents' dissemination of counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods such as the "theory of reading books to become officials," the class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of the graduates and their families were greatly raised.
