The Great Victory of Mao Zedong Thought: The Great Achievement of the Working Class Leading Everything

Our country's 10,000-ton ocean-going giant vessel, the "Gaoyang," has successfully launched.

In the midst of the triumphant songs of the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, another self-designed and self-built 10,000-ton ocean-going giant vessel, the "Gaoyang," has successfully launched. This is a victory for Mao Zedong Thought! This is another achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

The "Gaoyang" 10,000-ton ocean-going giant vessel is a product of the revolutionary workers of the Red Flag Shipyard, who, under Chairman Mao's great guidance that the working class must lead everything, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, grasped revolution, promoted production, and demonstrated a daring spirit of revolution. They relied on their own efforts, strove for self-improvement, and completed the construction task on the shipyard in just 39 days. Such a short time and such a fast pace to complete the construction task on the shipyard is rare in the history of world shipbuilding.

In the past, a handful of capitalist-roaders in this factory vigorously promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, severely restricting the enthusiasm and creativity of the working masses. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary masses of the Red Flag Shipyard, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist personnel, seized back the leadership usurped by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. At the same time, they deeply criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of Liu Shaoqi and his agents within the factory. The broad revolutionary masses were full of vigor and enthusiasm, determined to create outstanding production achievements under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and to achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

During the construction of the "Gaoyang," the shipbuilding workers followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "breaking superstitions and liberating thoughts," kicked out the bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities," fully mobilized the masses, carried out technological innovations and technological revolutions, greatly improved work efficiency, and shortened the shipbuilding cycle. In the past, workers had proposed using cement platforms to replace board mold frames, but this suggestion was rejected by bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities." Now, the workers boldly adopted the new technology of cement platforms and achieved success, not only realizing a major technological innovation but also saving the country more than 180 tons of steel. The new technologies, such as the welding of the ship's bow and stern columns, which those reactionary technical "authorities" did not even dare to think about, were also successfully implemented by the workers with great revolutionary spirit after repeated experiments, greatly improving work efficiency and the quality of the ship.

During the construction of this 10,000-ton giant vessel, the workers, with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, endured hardships and worked day and night. Some worked continuously for more than 20 hours in high temperatures without rest. They regarded sweating a drop more and welding a rod more as concrete expressions of their loyalty to Chairman Mao. When installing the large side plates, a level 7 gale blew, but experienced crane operators broke the foreign rule of not operating cranes in winds above level 6, overcame numerous difficulties, and finally, in the level 7 gale, accurately lifted and placed the heavy steel plates onto the ship's body. When the project entered the final stage of welding the stern column, a small slag leak suddenly occurred in the welding area. Within a few seconds, thousands of degrees of molten slag gushed down from the two-meter-high welding port. At this critical moment, veteran worker Lin Jiuying, remembering Chairman Mao's teaching of "resolving to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory," grabbed a piece of asbestos and bravely rushed towards the fire. The molten slag burned his arm, the high temperature scorched his clothes, and his skin blistered, but he continued to fight, ensuring the smooth progress of the project. The workers, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, built the 10,000-ton giant vessel with the fastest speed and the best quality.

After the publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the revolutionary workers building the "Gaoyang" 10,000-ton giant vessel were greatly inspired. They solemnly vowed to resolutely respond to the great battle call of the plenary session and to definitely complete the great historical task entrusted by Chairman Mao. After days and nights of hard work, they finally completed all preparations for the launch of the "Gaoyang" 10,000-ton giant vessel ahead of schedule. Currently, the broad shipbuilding workers of this factory, under the inspiration of the plenary session's communiqué, are determined to achieve new victories and present a gift to the Ninth National Congress of the Party.

    毛泽东思想的伟大胜利　工人阶级领导一切的巨大成果
    我国万吨级远洋巨轮“高阳号”胜利下水
    红旗造船厂的工人，发扬了敢想敢干的革命精神，只用三十九天时间完成了船台上的建造任务，这在世界造船史上是少有的。他们决心夺取新的胜利，向党的第九次全国代表大会献礼
    新华社二十日讯　在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，我国又一艘自行设计、自行建造的万吨级远洋巨轮——“高阳号”，于最近下水。这是毛泽东思想的胜利！是无产阶级文化大革命又一成果！
    “高阳号”万吨级远洋巨轮，是红旗造船厂的革命职工在毛主席关于工人阶级必须领导一切的伟大教导下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓革命，猛促生产，发扬了敢想敢干的革命精神，自力更生，奋发图强，只用了三十九天时间胜利地完成了在船台上的建造任务的。这样短短的时间，这样快的速度，完成船台上的建造任务，在世界造船史上是少有的。
    过去，这个厂的一小撮走资派，竭力推行叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义办企业路线，严重地束缚了工人群众的积极性和创造性。无产阶级文化大革命中，红旗造船厂的广大革命职工在人民解放军支左人员帮助下，夺回了被党内一小撮走资派窃踞的领导权，同时深入地批判了刘少奇及其在厂内代理人推行的反革命修正主义办企业路线。广大革命职工意气风发，斗志昂扬，决心在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，创造出色的生产成就，在无产阶级文化大革命中立新功。
    “高阳号”建造过程中，造船工人遵照毛主席关于“破除迷信，解放思想”的教导，踢开资产阶级反动技术“权威”，充分发动群众，大搞技术革新和技术革命，大大提高了工作效率，缩短了船体建造周期。过去工人曾提出用水泥平台代替板模胎架的建议，但是被资产阶级反动技术“权威”拒绝了。现在工人们大胆地采用了水泥平台的新工艺，获得了成功，不但实现了一项重大的技术革新，还为国家节省了一百八十多吨钢材。过去那些反动技术“权威”连想也不敢想的大船艏艉柱焊接等新技术，这次工人们也都以大无畏的革命精神，经过反复试验，获得了成功，大大提高了工作效率和轮船的质量。
    在这艘万吨巨轮建造过程中，工人们怀着无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的一颗红心，风餐露宿，日夜奋战。有的在高温下连续战斗二十多个小时不休息。他们把多流一滴汗水、多熔一根焊条，看作是向毛主席献忠心的具体表现。在安装大旁板时刮起了七级大风，经验丰富的起重工人打破了六级以上大风不准开动吊车的洋框框，克服了重重困难，终于在七级大风中把一块块沉重的钢板，准确地吊引到船体的位置上。工程进入焊接艉柱的最后阶段时，突然在焊接局部发现小漏渣，几秒钟内，上千度炽热的熔渣从两米多高的焊口处急泻下来。在这紧要关头，老工人林钧胜牢记毛主席的“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，拿起石棉灰，勇敢地向火口猛扑过去，熔渣烧伤了他的胳膊，高温烤着了他的衣服，他的皮肤烧起了血泡，但他一直坚持战斗，保证了工程的顺利进行。工人们就是这样怀着无限忠于毛主席的赤胆红心，以最快的速度，最好的质量，加速了万吨巨轮船体的建造。
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表后，建造“高阳号”万吨巨轮的革命职工受到极大的鼓舞，他们庄严宣誓：坚决响应全会发出的伟大战斗号召，一定要完成毛主席交给我们的伟大历史任务。他们经过日夜奋战，终于提前完成了“高阳号”万吨巨轮下水前的一切准备工作。目前，这个厂的广大造船工人正在全会公报的鼓舞下，决心夺取新的胜利，向党的第九次全国代表大会献礼。
