Resolved to Carry Forward the Struggle Against the Decayed Educational System to the End

Tokyo University Students in Japan Have Persisted in a Strike for Over 250 Days

Student Representative Denounces the Revisionist Group Led by Miyamoto as an Accomplice of the Reactionary Government, Sabotaging the Student Struggle

NEW DELHI, Nov. 20 (Xinhua) - According to a report from the Eastern News Agency, about 4,000 progressive students at Tokyo University in Japan, who have been on strike for over 250 days, held a meeting on November 18. They strongly condemned the evil deeds of the reactionary Sato government and the revisionist group led by Miyamoto of the Japanese Communist Party in their frenzied sabotage of the students' just struggle. They also expressed their determination to carry forward the struggle against the decayed and reactionary educational system to the end.

At the beginning of the meeting, all participants stood up and sang the "Internationale," and shouted seven just demands, including: the school authorities should admit their criminal collusion with the police in the savage suppression of students, and guarantee that no student participating in the student struggle since January this year will be punished.

A student representative spoke at the meeting, severely denouncing the plot by the revisionist group led by Miyamoto to sabotage the student struggle. He pointed out: "Every time the struggle reaches a new high tide, the traitorous clique of the Democratic Youth League (a youth organization controlled by the revisionist group of the Japanese Communist Party) jumps out to try to extinguish the flames of the struggle; every time a strike begins, they shout 'oppose the strike'; every time the occupation of school buildings begins, they shout 'oppose the occupation.' They have always used these methods to oppose the students' just struggle, standing on the side of the reactionary school authorities. The revisionist traitorous clique of the Japanese Communist Party has played a role that the police force cannot play. However, the broad masses of students have seen through the counter-revolutionary face of the Japanese Communist Party revisionists, and they will not allow these revisionists' plots to succeed."

Under the impact of the students' heroic struggle, the leadership of Tokyo University, headed by Ohkouchinichi, recently collapsed. To quell the students' struggle, the reactionary Sato government appointed the reactionary professor Kato Ichiro as the acting president.

In the afternoon of November 18, just as the students were holding a meeting, Kato Ichiro hypocritically walked into the meeting hall. At this time, the student representative on the platform, with a high-pitched voice, exposed through the loudspeaker the series of crimes committed by the reactionary university authorities against the student movement so far, and demanded that they bow their heads and confess. Kato tried to shift the blame, but the students immediately exposed him as a lackey of the reactionary Sato government, just like the former president Ohkouchinichi. The students repeatedly shouted angrily at Kato: "Go home, go home!" Kato was in a desperate situation and was driven out of the meeting hall.

After the meeting, the students held a magnificent demonstration in the campus, shouting battle slogans, and expressed their determination to carry the struggle to the end.

    决心把反对腐朽教育制度的斗争进行到底
    日本东京大学学生坚持罢课二百五十多天
    学生代表怒斥宫本修正主义集团充当反动政府帮凶破坏学生斗争
    新华社二十日讯　据东方通讯社报道：坚持了二百五十多天罢课斗争的日本东京大学进步学生约四千人，十八日举行集会，强烈谴责佐藤反动政府和日共宫本修正主义集团疯狂破坏学生正义斗争的罪恶行径，并表示，决心把反对腐朽、反动的教育制度的斗争进行到底。
    会议开始时，全体与会者起立高唱《国际歌》，并高呼七项正义要求，其中包括：学校当局承认他们勾结警察疯狂镇压学生的滔天罪行，保证不处罚自今年一月以来参加学生斗争的任何学生等。
    一位学生代表在会上发言，严厉谴责宫本修正主义集团策划破坏学生斗争的阴谋。他指出：“每当斗争发展到新的高潮时，民主青年同盟（日共修正主义集团控制下的青年组织）的卖国集团总是跳出来企图扑灭斗争的烈火；每当罢课开始时，他们总是叫嚷‘反对罢课’；每当开始占领学校大楼时，他们总是叫喊‘反对占领’。他们一贯用这种办法反对学生的正义斗争，站在学校反动当局一边。日共修正主义卖国集团充当了警察部队所不能充当的角色。但是，广大学生群众已经识破了日共修正主义分子的反革命嘴脸，他们决不允许这些修正主义分子的阴谋得逞。”
    在学生英勇斗争的冲击下，以大河内一男为首的东京大学的校领导最近宣告垮台。为了平息学生的斗争，佐藤反动政府新任命反动教授加藤一郎为代理校长。
    十八日下午，正当学生举行集会的时候，加藤一郎假惺惺地走进了会议厅。这时，主席台上的学生代表以高昂的声调通过扩音器揭露反动的大学当局迄今为止对学生运动所犯下的一系列罪行，并要求他们向学生们低头认罪。加藤妄图推卸罪责，学生们当场揭露，他同前任校长大河内一男一样，也是佐藤反动政府的走狗。学生们对着加藤不断地愤怒高呼：“滚回家去，滚回家去！”加藤狼狈不堪，被赶出了会议厅。
    会后，学生们在校园里举行了轰轰烈烈的示威游行，高呼战斗口号，表示要把斗争进行到底。
