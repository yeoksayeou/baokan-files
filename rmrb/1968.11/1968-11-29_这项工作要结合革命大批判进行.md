The revolutionary committee of Yushu County, with the assistance of the county military department and the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, has taken advantage of the discussion sparked by the People's Daily on the issue of public primary schools being managed by production brigades. We have fully mobilized the masses to launch a comprehensive criticism of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction means criticism, means revolution." For a long time, the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi has implemented a complete set of counter-revolutionary revisionist educational lines, poisoning young students and suppressing the enthusiasm of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to run schools. The poor and lower-middle peasants say: "In the past, we had complaints about schools but nowhere to voice them. Even if we voiced them, nothing was done. Not voicing them made us angry, and voicing them made us even more angry." We believe that if we do not carry out this criticism of the revisionist educational line, we cannot eliminate the long-standing poison it has spread, and we cannot fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the poor and lower-middle peasants to run schools. Even if public primary schools are managed by production brigades, there is still a possibility of a return to the old ways in rural education.

To carry out this criticism of the revisionist educational line, some members of the county revolutionary committee personally went to the masses, organizing the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to seriously study Chairman Mao's latest instructions on educational revolution. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, with deep class feelings for Chairman Mao, set up battlefields for criticism in production team offices, households, and courtyards. Facing real materials and using real facts, they launched a mass campaign to expose, denounce, and criticize the revisionist goods such as "intellectual education first," "grades first," "entrance exams first," and the "study to become an official" theory. An old poor peasant angrily said: "My family has been illiterate for generations. After liberation, we stood up, and our children had the opportunity to go to school. But the big traitor Liu Shaoqi extended his black hand into the schools, using his agents to poison our children with 'grades first' and 'entrance exams first.' My daughter studied for six years in primary school and got sick. Before the middle school entrance exam, she was already so sick she could hardly bear it. But the school thought my daughter had good grades and not participating in the exam would affect the admission rate, so they didn't care about my daughter's life and forced her to take the exam. My daughter passed the exam and got into middle school, but after this ordeal, her illness worsened, and she died a few days later. The revisionist educational line is truly deadly!" Many poor and lower-middle peasants said at the criticism meetings that before liberation, only the children of landlords and rich peasants could go to school. Chairman Mao led us to stand up, and our children had the opportunity to go to school and study. We hoped they would carry on the revolution, but unexpectedly, they were poisoned by Liu Shaoqi's 'study to become an official' theory. They studied and studied, but couldn't tell friend from foe, couldn't hold a sickle or a hoe, and didn't look like children of poor and lower-middle peasants at all! The more they criticized, the more they hated the revisionist educational line, and the more they loved Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Through the revolutionary criticism, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants further raised their class consciousness and truly realized that "the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools must not continue." If we don't carry out the educational revolution well, we poor and lower-middle peasants will suffer twice. They said, Chairman Mao trusts us and asks us to manage the schools well. We must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions, run the schools according to the brilliant "May 7th Directive," and let our children and grandchildren forever listen to Chairman Mao's words and carry on the revolution.

    这项工作要结合革命大批判进行
    我们榆树县革命委员会在县武装部和驻军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，借《人民日报》“关于公办小学下放到大队来办”的大讨论的东风，充分发动群众，展开对刘少奇反革命修正主义教育路线的大批判。
    毛主席教导我们：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。”长期以来，叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇推行了一整套反革命修正主义教育路线，毒害了青年学生，打击了广大贫下中农办学的积极性。贫下中农说：“过去对学校有意见没处提，提了也不管用。有意见不提生气，提了还惹气。”我们认为，如果不进行这场对修正主义教育路线的大批判，就不能肃清它长期以来的流毒，就不能充分发挥贫下中农办学的积极性，公办小学即便由生产大队来办了，农村教育仍然有复旧的可能。
    为了开展好这场对修正主义教育路线的大批判，县革委会部分常委和委员，亲自上阵，深入群众之中，组织广大贫下中农认真学习了毛主席关于教育革命的最新指示。广大贫下中农闻风而动，怀着对毛主席无比深厚的阶级感情，在生产队队部、家庭、场院，都摆开了大批判的战场。面对活材料，运用活事实，对“智育第一”、“分数第一”、“升学第一”和“读书做官论”等修正主义黑货，进行了群众性的大揭发、大控诉、大批判。一位老贫农气愤地说：“我家祖辈几代都没念过书，解放后翻了身，孩子才有机会上学读书。可是大叛徒刘少奇却把黑手伸到学校，通过他的代理人用‘分数第一’‘升学第一’毒害了我们的子女。我女儿在小学念了六年书，得了一身病。考初中前已病得难以支持，可是学校认为我女儿分数高，不参加考试影响升学率，就不顾我女儿的死活，硬要叫她去考试。我女儿考是考上了中学，可是经过这么一折磨，病更加重了，不几天就死了。修正主义的教育路线真是害死人！”许多贫下中农在批判会上说，解放前只有地主、富农的孩子能念书。毛主席他老人家领导我们翻了身，我们的孩子才有了上学读书的机会。满指望他们接好革命的班，哪曾想却中了刘少奇“读书做官论”的毒，念来念去分不清敌我，拿不起镰刀锄头，哪象个贫下中农子女的样子！大家越批判，对修正主义教育路线越恨，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线越爱。
    通过革命大批判，广大贫下中农进一步提高了阶级觉悟，真正认识到“资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。”不搞好教育革命，我们广大贫下中农还要受二遍苦。他们说，毛主席信任我们，叫我们管好学校，我们一定要坚决落实毛主席的指示，根据光辉的“五·七”指示办好学校，让子子孙孙永远听毛主席的话，接好革命的班。　吉林省榆树县革委会
