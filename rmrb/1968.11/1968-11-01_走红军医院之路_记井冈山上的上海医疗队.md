On the revolutionary old base area of Jinggangshan, there is a medical team highly welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants. This medical team, whether under the scorching sun of the day or in the midst of wind and rain at night, often climbs hills and valleys, entering the homes of the poor and lower-middle peasants. They carry an infinite red heart loyal to Chairman Mao, serving the poor and lower-middle peasants wholeheartedly, and saving many class brothers who were plagued by illness and in critical condition. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants affectionately call them "good doctors sent by Chairman Mao," and the older generation praises them as "just like the Red Army doctors of old," urging them to stay for a long time.

This medical team is composed of sixteen medical and nursing personnel from the Xuhui District Hospital and Minhang Workers and Peasants Hospital in Shanghai. They follow the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching to "shift the focus of medical and health work to the countryside" and came to the revolutionary holy land of Jinggangshan in March of this year.

Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice of leading the workers and peasants to make revolution on Jinggangshan in the past inspires every member of the medical team. The medical style of the Red Army Hospital established on Jinggangshan, which served the people wholeheartedly, and the revolutionary spirit of the Red Army doctors deeply inspire them. They are determined to follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao and stride forward on the glorious path of serving the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Making Do with Limited Resources to Establish a New-Type "Red Army Hospital"

A small medical team that came to Maoping lives to the left of the former Red Army Hospital.

Due to the influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist medical and health line pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, there is a severe shortage of medical personnel and medicines here. After the medical team arrived, they held a study class on Mao Zedong Thought in the former Red Army Hospital, studying Chairman Mao's brilliant directive to "shift the focus of medical and health work to the countryside," severely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, and inviting revolutionary elders to introduce the glorious deeds of the Red Army Hospital's hard work in the past. Through study, the medical team's awareness of the two-line struggle has greatly increased. They decided to take the Red Army Hospital as an example, start from scratch, and establish a new-type "Red Army Hospital." They borrowed a few benches and wooden planks, which they used as beds; without water, they took turns fetching it from a well a mile away; a simple wooden plank bed served as the operating table, a bamboo bed as the delivery bed, a teapot as the washing basin, and a washbasin as the sterilizing pot. In this way, without spending a single penny of the state's money, they set up a simple laboratory, operating room, and several wards.

In this small hospital, in this operating room that, in the eyes of those bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities," is "violating regulations and standards" and "unqualified," under conditions of no operating table, no surgical lamp, no blood supply, no oxygen, and no running water, the medical team members, with their deep class feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants, lit kerosene lamps and used flashlights to successfully perform dozens of major and medium-sized surgeries such as stomach resection, gallbladder removal, total hysterectomy, and appendectomy. The effects were very good, and there were no cases of wound infection. The poor and lower-middle peasants unanimously praised: This is truly our poor and lower-middle peasants' hospital, just like the Red Army Hospital of old!

Like the Red Army Hospital, Serving the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Wholeheartedly

The medical team members take the Red Army Hospital as an example in everything, always thinking of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and continuously improving their work. The poor and lower-middle peasants like the Red Army Hospital of old the most and are most resentful of the lordly attitude in today's urban hospitals. They say: "The Red Army Hospital of old was good, they saw patients as they arrived, with simple procedures. Now, we are afraid to enter urban hospitals. To see a doctor once, we have to queue up four or five times, sometimes standing for several hours. Farming is busy in the countryside, where do we have so much time to queue up!" The medical team members immediately, with the convenience of the masses in mind, improved the medical system, combining seeing patients, registration, payment, and dispensing medicines, so that patients could be seen as they arrived, greatly saving the poor and lower-middle peasants' time for seeing a doctor.

To be more convenient for the masses, they also established a mobile medical system, considering the characteristics of the mountainous area with vast land and scattered population. They traversed mountains and valleys, climbed hills and crossed gullies, and visited the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants who lived thirty or forty miles away from their residences.

The medical team members, taking the Red Army Hospital as an example, broke the old framework of overly specialized divisions, and better served the poor and lower-middle peasants. They are all doctors, each one a nurse, the anesthesiologist also a midwife, the pharmacist and nurse also prescribe medicines. In May of this year, a female peasant from Maoping Brigade had difficulty giving birth. A doctor from the local hospital who had not had his thoughts reformed refused to go out for a house call. At that time, the medical team only left one traditional Chinese medicine doctor and one nurse at home on duty. They had no clinical experience in delivering babies, but they thought of Chairman Mao's teaching of "saving the dying and helping the injured, practicing revolutionary humanitarianism," and the high sense of responsibility of the Red Army doctors who served the poor and lower-middle peasants wholeheartedly. Without hesitation, they picked up their medicine boxes and rushed to the pregnant woman's home. Upon arriving at the delivery room, they carefully examined the position of the fetus and enthusiastically propagated Mao Zedong Thought to the pregnant woman. After half a day of intense work, the pregnant woman finally gave birth safely. This delivery made the medical team members deeply aware: this division and that division, we medical personnel only have this one division of treating diseases for the people. As long as we have a red heart of serving the people wholeheartedly like the Red Army doctors, we can overcome any difficulty.

The Red Army doctors' spirit of being extremely responsible for their work in the past constantly inspired the medical team members to overcome numerous difficulties and rescue many critically ill patients. In May of this year, a small medical team stationed at the Bailu Reclamation Farm found that a pregnant woman's stomach was unusually large. After repeated careful examinations, they diagnosed her with an ovarian tumor. The small team members persuaded the pregnant woman to have surgery, but she had reservations and did not agree to be examined. The medical team members repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teaching of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, and to relieve her pain as soon as possible, visited the pregnant woman's home five times to persuade her. Finally, they convinced her and her family members, performed the surgery, removed a tumor weighing more than twenty pounds, and protected the fetus inside, making the pregnant woman quickly recover her health. This incident deeply moved the poor and lower-middle peasants. They said: "In the past, patients had to invite doctors, and even then, they might not come after three or five visits; now, doctors invite patients, patiently persuading patients to seek treatment. This is truly a good doctor taught by Chairman Mao, we poor and lower-middle peasants like such scholars."

The medical team members, to rescue critically ill patients, were not afraid of dirt or fatigue. Some members, while rescuing patients, performed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation with the patients. Some, to prevent infants from suffocating, used their mouths to suck out the amniotic fluid mouthful by mouthful. Some even donated their own blood to the poor and lower-middle peasants. The small medical team stationed at the Bailu Reclamation Farm, to meet the need for blood transfusion, repeatedly drew blood from their own bodies, and were called a "living blood bank" by the people.

The glorious deeds of the Red Army Hospital training doctors on the spot in the past greatly inspired and educated the medical team members. They took the Red Army Hospital as an example and, in practice, trained a batch of "barefoot doctors," making it possible for the poor and lower-middle peasants living in scattered residences to receive timely treatment when they fall ill. Now, most of the "barefoot doctors" they trained can already independently diagnose and treat common and frequently occurring diseases in the countryside. The poor and lower-middle peasants happily said: "Now we have our own doctors, minor illnesses can be treated without leaving the brigade. Chairman Mao has thought so much for us poor and lower-middle peasants!"

Receiving Re-education from the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants, Becoming True "Red Army Doctors"

The medical team members received profound education in their interactions with the poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants often gave them classes on recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, using their personal experiences to denounce the evil old society. The poor and lower-middle peasants also often told the medical team members about Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice of leading the workers and peasants to fight landlords and distribute land in the past, and about the hard work and rescue efforts of the Red Army doctors in the past. These were all vivid and profound classes on class education and revolutionary tradition education for the medical team members, greatly inspiring their infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao and their deep class feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants, and powerfully promoting their thought revolutionization. Once, a "barefoot doctor" came to the hospital to buy medicine, bought the medicine, and immediately picked up the medicine box and hurried back. An old poor peasant from the brigade asked him: "Why are you in such a hurry to go back?" The "barefoot doctor" replied: "To attend the brigade's Mao Zedong Thought study class." The old poor peasant heard this and happily said: "That's right, you must study Chairman Mao's works well. If you don't study Chairman Mao's works well, carrying the medicine box is of no use!" The poor and lower-middle peasants' limitless love for Chairman Mao and their eager desire to study Chairman Mao's works deeply moved the medical team members. From then on, they firmly put the study of Chairman Mao's works in the first place. They deeply felt: "We treat the poor and lower-middle peasants' physical illnesses, and the poor and lower-middle peasants treat our ideological illnesses. If our ideological illnesses are not cured, we cannot wholeheartedly serve the poor and lower-middle peasants."

Recently, all members of the medical team seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest directive: "Students trained in old schools, the majority or a large majority can unite with workers, peasants, and soldiers, some have made inventions and creations, but they must be under the leadership of the correct line, and workers, peasants, and soldiers must give them re-education to thoroughly change their old ideas. Such intellectuals are welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers." Chairman Mao's latest directive gave them the greatest encouragement. They decided to leave the hospital and live in the homes of the poor and lower-middle peasants, eating, living, working, studying, and criticizing and repudiating revisionism together with them, so as to better serve the poor and lower-middle peasants, better receive re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants, thoroughly change their old ideas, and become true Red Army doctors as praised by the poor and lower-middle peasants.

    走红军医院之路
    ——记井冈山上的上海医疗队
    在革命老根据地井冈山上，有一支深受贫下中农欢迎的医疗队。这支医疗队，不管是烈日当头的白天，还是风雨交加的黑夜，常常爬岭过坳，进出贫下中农的家门。他们怀着一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心，全心全意为贫下中农服务，挽救了不少病魔缠身、危在旦夕的阶级兄弟。广大贫下中农亲切地称呼他们是“毛主席派来的好医生”，老一辈的人赞扬他们“和当年的红军医生一样”，要求他们长期留下来。
    这支医疗队是由上海徐汇区医院和闵行工农医院的十六名医护人员组成的。他们遵循伟大领袖毛主席“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的教导，在今年三月间来到了革命圣地井冈山。
    毛主席当年在井冈山上领导工农大众闹革命的伟大革命实践激励着医疗队的每一个同志。当年设在井冈山上的红军医院全心全意为人民服务的医疗作风和红军医生的革命精神，深深地鼓舞着他们。他们决心遵照毛主席指引的方向，在为贫下中农服务的光荣道路上阔步前进。
    因陋就简，办一所新型的“红军医院”
    来到茅坪的一支医疗小分队，就住在当年红军医院的左侧。
    这里，由于中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的反革命修正主义的医疗卫生路线的影响，严重地缺医少药。医疗队的同志来到这里后，就在当年的红军医院办了一期毛泽东思想学习班，学习了毛主席“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的光辉指示，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，并请来革命老人介绍当年红军医院艰苦工作的光辉事迹。经过学习，医疗队同志的两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高了。他们决心以红军医院为榜样，白手起家，办起一所新型的“红军医院”。他们借来了几条板凳和几副木板，架起来就是病床；没有水，就天天轮流到一里路外的石井去挑；普通的小木板床就是手术台，竹榻就是产床，茶缸当作洗手桶，脸盆当作消毒锅。就这样，没有花国家一分钱，他们就建起了一个简易的化验室、手术室和几间病房。
    就在这个小小的医院里，在这个那些资产阶级反动学术“权威”们看来是“违反规章制度”、“不合格”的手术室里，在没有手术台，没有无影灯，没有血源，没有氧气，没有自来水的情况下，医疗队的同志们怀着对贫下中农的深厚的阶级感情，点着煤油灯，打着手电筒，成功地施行了胃切除、胆囊切除、子宫全切除、阑尾切除等几十例大中型手术，效果很好，并且没有出现过伤口感染的现象。贫下中农一致称赞：这真正是我们贫下中农的医院，是当年的红军医院！
  象红军医院那样，全心全意为贫下中农服务
    医疗队的同志处处以红军医院为榜样，事事为贫下中农着想，不断改进自己的工作。贫下中农最喜欢当年的红军医院，最恼恨现在城市医院里的老爷作风。他们说：“当年的红军医院就是好，随到随看，手续简便。现在的城市医院我们怕进门，看一次病要排四、五次队，有时站上几个钟头，农村生产忙，那有这么多时间去排队！”医疗队同志立即从方便群众着眼，改进了医疗制度，把看病和挂号、收费和发药合并起来，使病人能够随到随看，大大节省了贫下中农的看病时间。
    为了方便群众，他们还针对山区地广人稀，居住分散的特点，建立了巡回医疗制度。他们跋山涉水，爬岭过坳，踏遍了高山深沟，把医药送到远离住所三四十里的贫下中农家里去。
    医疗队的同志以红军医院为榜样，打破了分科过细的旧框框，更好地为贫下中农服务。他们人人是医师，个个当护士，麻醉医师也当助产士，药剂师、护士同样开处方。今年五月间，茅坪大队一位贫农女社员难产，当地医院一个思想没有改造好的医师拒绝出诊。当时，医疗队只留下一个中医师、一个护士在家值班。他们都没有接生的临床经验，但是他们想到毛主席“救死扶伤，实行革命的人道主义”的教导，想到红军医生全心全意为贫下中农服务的高度责任感，毫不犹豫地背起药箱赶到产妇家里。一到产房，他们就仔细地检查产妇的胎位，热情地向产妇宣传毛泽东思想。经过大半天的紧张工作，产妇终于安全分娩。这次接生，使医疗队同志受到深刻教育，他们深有体会地说：这科那科，我们医务人员只有为人民治病这一科，只要象红军医生那样，有一颗全心全意为人民服务的红心，就什么困难都可以克服。
    当年红军医生对工作极端负责的精神，时刻鼓舞着医疗队的同志战胜重重困难，抢救了不少垂危病人。今年五月间，驻白露垦殖场一支医疗小分队的同志在为一位孕妇看病时，发现她的肚子大得出奇，经过反复的仔细的检查，断定她患有卵巢肿瘤。小分队的同志就动员孕妇开刀切除，但这位妇女有顾虑，不肯就诊。医疗队同志反复学习了毛主席“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的教导，为了及早解除她的痛苦，先后五次到孕妇家中进行动员。最后说服了她本人和她的家属，施行了手术，切除了一个二十多斤重的肿瘤，并且保护了胎内婴儿，使这位孕妇很快恢复了健康。这件事，使贫下中农深受感动。他们说：“过去是病人请医生，三番五次还请不到呢；现在是医生请病人，耐心动员病人去治病。这真是毛主席教导的好医生，我们贫下中农就是喜欢这样的读书人。”
    医疗队的同志为了抢救危急病人，不怕脏，不怕累，有的同志在抢救病人时，同病人口对口呼吸，有的同志为了防止婴儿窒息，用嘴一口一口地把羊水吸出来，有的同志还把自己的血献给贫下中农。驻白露垦殖场的医疗小分队的同志，为了满足配血需要，多次把自己身上的血抽出来，被人们称为“活血库”。
    当年红军医院就地培训医生的光辉事迹，使医疗队同志受到很大的启发和教育。他们以红军医院为榜样，在实践中带教了一批“赤脚医生”，使居住分散的贫下中农有病能得到及时治疗。现在，他们带教的绝大多数“赤脚医生”已经能够独立诊断和治疗农村的多发病和常见病。贫下中农高兴地说：“现在有了我们自己的医生，小病可以不出大队，毛主席为我们贫下中农想得多周到！”接受贫下中农再教育，做真正的“红军医生”
    医疗队的同志在和贫下中农接触中，受到了深刻的教育。贫下中农常常向他们进行忆苦思甜，用切身经历控诉万恶的旧社会。贫下中农还常常给医疗队同志讲述毛主席当年领导工农群众打土豪、分田地的伟大革命实践，讲述当年红军医生艰苦奋斗、救死扶伤的工作情景。这些，都是对医疗队同志的一堂生动深刻的阶级教育和革命传统教育课，大大地激发了他们对毛主席的无限忠诚和对贫下中农的深厚阶级感情，有力地促进了他们的思想革命化。有一次，一位“赤脚医生”到医院来买药，买好药立即背起药箱往回走。大队的一位老贫农问他：“你这样急着赶回去做什么？”这位“赤脚医生”回答说：“赶去参加大队毛泽东思想学习班。”老贫农听了高兴地说：“对了，就是要好好学习毛主席著作，不学好毛主席著作，背着药箱也没有用！”贫下中农无限热爱毛主席，如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作的精神，深深地感动了医疗队的同志。从此，他们坚定不移地把学习毛主席著作摆在第一位。他们深有体会地说：“我们为贫下中农治身体上的病，贫下中农为我们治思想上的病，思想上的病没有治好，就不可能全心全意地为贫下中农服务。”
    最近，医疗队的全体同志认真学习了毛主席的最新指示：“从旧学校培养的学生，多数或大多数是能够同工农兵结合的，有些人并有所发明、创造，不过要在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想。这样的知识分子，工农兵是欢迎的。”毛主席的最新指示，给了他们最大的鼓舞。他们决心走出医院，分别住到贫下中农家里去，和贫下中农同吃同住同劳动同学习同斗私批修，以便更好地为贫下中农服务，更好地接受贫下中农的再教育，彻底改变旧思想，做一个象贫下中农所称赞的那样真正的红军医生。　　　　新华社通讯员（本报略有删节）
