At a criticism meeting, an elderly person angrily waved his fist, using ironclad facts to criticize the great traitor Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle." Instantly, the meeting hall echoed with thunderous roars: "Down with Liu Shaoqi!"

This elderly person is Li Meihu, a poor peasant from Li Dongjia Production Brigade, Lüjia Commune, Huimin County, Shandong Province. After Chairman Mao issued the latest directive on rectifying and building the Party, Li Dongjia Brigade, with the help of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in the village, bravely took the lead in criticizing Liu Shaoqi's revisionist line of building the Party. However, the only ones who did not show up were the five-guarantee household Li Meihu and his wife. This caught the attention of the propaganda team member Little Wang, who went to their home to study Chairman Mao's latest directive with Grandpa Li. Speaking earnestly, Little Wang said, "Party power is the core of political power. Caring about the Party's construction is the greatest politics and the greatest loyalty to Chairman Mao. Otherwise, the proletarian party will become a revisionist party. At that time, the working people will again have to suffer as slaves to the landlords!"

A single spark can start a prairie fire, and a little guidance can clear the path. Chairman Mao's teachings illuminated Grandpa Li's mind. Grandpa Li and his wife were both nearly seventy years old. In the old society, they had experienced the bitter life of being slaves. Looking up at Chairman Mao's portrait, with tears of excitement, Grandpa Li said, "Parents are dear, but the Party and Chairman Mao are dearer. The river is deep, the sea is deep, but the Party and Chairman Mao's kindness runs deeper. Chairman Mao! Without you, there would be no Li Meihu, and there would be no hope for the poor people of the world. I will follow you forever!"

At this moment, Little Wang thought: The fire needs more fuel! He said, "Grandpa, do you know? Someone wants to turn the Communist Party into a revisionist party!" Grandpa Li, upon hearing this, was filled with rage and insisted on understanding the whole story. Little Wang then took the opportunity to tell him about Liu Shaoqi's "six black theories" in detail. This made Grandpa Li even more enlightened. He said, "No wonder in recent years some Party members in the village have unclear class standpoints, causing the village to be filled with landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and the poor and lower-middle peasants are not respected. It's all because some Party members have been poisoned by Liu Shaoqi's 'theory of the extinction of class struggle.' Fortunately, Chairman Mao, with his high vision and foresight, personally launched the Cultural Revolution. Otherwise, who knows how things would have changed, and who knows how heads would have rolled. This is so dangerous! Whatever Chairman Mao says, I will do. I will actively participate in the revolutionary criticism, and eliminate the poison spread by this big villain Liu Shaoqi."

After that, every evening after dinner, Grandpa Li and his wife would bring their small stools to the criticism meeting, often being the first to arrive and the first to speak. His revolutionary spirit moved everyone. The poor and lower-middle peasants unanimously praised him: "A heart of red, loyal to the Party, a veteran of the revolutionary criticism."

　　大批判中的老将
    批判会上，有一位老年人愤怒地挥动着拳头，以铁的事实批判了大叛徒刘少奇散布的“阶级斗争熄灭论”。顿时，会场上激起阵阵春雷般怒吼声：“打倒刘少奇！”
    这老人是山东省惠民县吕家公社李栋家大队贫农社员李美湖。当毛主席发出了整党建党的最新指示后，李栋家大队在驻村解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，个个奋勇当先，大批刘少奇的修正主义建党路线。可是，唯有五保户李美湖老两口不露面。这事引起了宣传队小王的注意，他上门和李大爷一起学习毛主席的最新指示，语重心长地说：“党权是政权的核心，关心党的建设，是最大的政治，是对毛主席最大的忠。不然，无产阶级的党就会变成修正主义的党。到那时，劳动人民又要重给地主当牛做马！”灯亮只在一拨，路迷只要一点。毛主席的教导，使大爷的心豁然亮了。李大爷和老伴都年近七十了，在旧社会饱尝过当牛做马的苦难生活。他仰望着毛主席的画像，含着激动的眼泪说：“爹亲娘亲，没有党和毛主席亲，河深海深，没有党和毛主席的恩情深。毛主席啊！没有您老人家，就没有我李美湖，就没有天下穷人的一切。我跟您老人家走定了！”这时，小王心想：明火还得加把柴！便说：“大爷，你知道吗？有人要把共产党变成修正主义的党！”李大爷听了怒火万丈，一定要弄清来龙去脉。小王就趁势把刘少奇散布的黑“六论”，一五一十地告诉了他。这一说，大爷心里更亮了。他说：“怪不得这些年村里有些党员阶级观点不明，弄得村里地、富、反、坏、右不臭，贫下中农不香，就是有的党员中了刘少奇‘阶级斗争熄灭论’的毒。幸亏毛主席他老人家站得高，看得远，亲自发动了文化大革命，不然的话，天变了还不知道怎么变的，头掉了还不知怎么掉的。这是多么危险啊！毛主席咋说俺咋办。俺要积极参加革命大批判，把刘少奇这个大坏蛋散布的流毒肃清。”
    此后，李大爷和老伴每天吃过晚饭，提起小板凳便向批判会会场跑，常常是第一个到会，第一个发言。他这种革命精神，使大家很感动。贫下中农一致赞扬他：一颗红心向着党，是革命大批判中的老将。
