The primary schools in each village of our Wutai Commune use a set of teaching materials that are highly welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary teachers and students, and revolutionary cadres. These materials were created during the campaign to universalize primary education in July this year. Students say: "This book is easy to understand, easy to learn, and practical." Teachers say: "This book is easy to teach and learn, and it is beneficial for students' all-around development in terms of morality, intelligence, and physical fitness." Production team cadres say: "Our compiled teaching materials are politically strong, closely aligned with the movement, and serve production well." Many poor and lower-middle peasants say: "Our compiled teaching materials are truly excellent! From the first lesson, children learn 'Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!' They also remember the bitterness of class struggle, smash the characters of revisionism, and even include our farming experiences in the materials. If children read such books, the next generation will not become revisionists."

Dare to Tread New Paths

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on educational revolution, the communes of Wutai, Zhoulou, and Lizhuang took the lead in criticizing the revisionist educational line and promoting the universalization of primary education. The poor and lower-middle peasants took control of the pen, and primary education was rapidly universalized. The number of students enrolled increased from the original 587 to 1,034. They had no teachers, so they selected their own; they had no classrooms, so they cleared out their own; they had no desks and chairs, so they made their own. The most pressing problem was the lack of textbooks. What should they do? At that time, some suggested buying books from bookstores in other places; others suggested borrowing from students who had completed the first grade. Some proposed: "If we can't borrow enough or buy them, what then?" Others asked: "Do the books from before the Cultural Revolution have poison?" Some said: "Rooms and desks and chairs don't stop us, but without books, we have to rely on higher authorities!" Many people were both anxious and worried.

The leadership of Zhoulou Commune organized the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Management Committee for Schools (then called the Universal Primary Education Committee) to study the above problems with the guidance of Chairman Mao's great teachings: "Humanity must constantly summarize experience, make discoveries, inventions, and creations, and make progress. The theory of stagnation, pessimistic theory, the theory of doing nothing, and the theory of complacency and self-satisfaction are all wrong." Chairman Mao's teachings illuminated everyone's thoughts and inspired everyone's revolutionary enthusiasm. County poor peasant representative Yang Xianwu said: "In the past, we thought that books were compiled by 'scholars' and 'experts,' and we ordinary people couldn't do it. It was only after studying Chairman Mao's instructions that we realized that the books compiled by bourgeois intellectuals in the past were poison, serving the exploiting classes. We poor and lower-middle peasants know best what to use to cultivate successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, and we have the deepest feelings for Chairman Mao's proletarian thoughts and the right to compile teaching materials." Brigade cadre Zhang Chongguang said: "We will do as Chairman Mao says. Since there are no textbooks, we will compile our own. It's not enough for just a few of us; we need to consult with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. They have the most methods and the most experience. We should also invite teachers to participate." In this way, the poor and lower-middle peasants, cadres, and teachers all worked together, and with many hands, the problem was solved.

The People Are the True Heroes

Following the lead of Zhoulou Commune, the communes of Wutai and Lizhuang also compiled teaching materials based on Chairman Mao's teachings on self-reliance. They closely followed Chairman Mao's series of instructions on educational revolution, focusing on the needs of the current three great revolutionary movements. They mobilized the masses and implemented the method of compiling teaching materials through the combination of revolutionary cadres, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary teachers. In a short period, they compiled and selected a volume of language teaching materials, totaling 30 lessons. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants said: "The pen is in our hands, and peasants are compiling books. This is truly unprecedented."

Their main experiences are:

1. **Break First, Then Establish**: They first studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "not breaking means not establishing" and used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to criticize old teaching materials. The poor and lower-middle peasants said: "In the past, books were about 'school starts, school starts, carrying a schoolbag to school, greeting the teacher with a bow, and greeting classmates with a hello.' It didn't emphasize proletarian politics at all. _The Cat Fishing_, _The Crow Drinking Water_, _Sima Guang_, and all sorts of nonsense were included in the books. 'In front of the house and behind the house, planting melons and beans,' isn't this the black goods of China's Khrushchev's 'three freedoms and one contract'? Chairman Mao's teaching 'education must be revolutionized' is correct! If it weren't for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we poor and lower-middle peasants would still be in the dark, and China's Khrushchev would lead the next generation to revisionism, and we wouldn't know the difference. Now that Chairman Mao has given us the pen, we must eliminate the black goods from the old teaching materials and select Chairman Mao's words to let the children read Chairman Mao's books from a young age, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions to become good students of Chairman Mao."

2. **Chairman Mao's Instructions as the Highest Principle**: They further recognized that to cultivate successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, they must use the most revolutionary content. Chairman Mao's words are all truths and must be the fundamental teaching materials. At the same time, they must follow Chairman Mao's educational policy, the "May 7th Directive," and teachings on "thoroughly reforming teaching materials," being concise and precise, and making class struggle a main course. They must closely follow the needs of the three great revolutionary struggles in rural areas and consider the students' age characteristics for selection and compilation. The first lesson is "Long live Chairman Mao!" Other lessons must cultivate students' unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, unlimited loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Chairman Mao's quotations on consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat occupy a major position. The teaching materials also select quotations according to the current situation, tasks, and class struggle in the region, such as "Revolutionary Committees are good," and the heroic words of Comrade Deng. They also selected and compiled songs reflecting the masses' unlimited love for the great leader Chairman Mao and extreme hatred for the landlord class and China's Khrushchev, such as "Standing on Zhoulou looking at Beijing, with unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao. Sweep away all harmful insects, and defend Mao Zedong to the death." "The old society was full of bitterness, and the poor and lower-middle peasants had no culture. The landlord bosses controlled the pen, and a stroke of the pen was worth tens of thousands of yuan." There are also heroic words and agricultural proverbs for revolutionary farming, such as "Learn from Dazhai to farm for the revolution," "The first heatwave is for radishes, the middle heatwave is for mustard greens, and the last heatwave is for cabbages."

3. **Adhere to the Mass Line, Mobilize the Masses, and Implement the "Three-Combination"**: When selecting teaching materials, they let the poor and lower-middle peasants discuss, and the materials came out. No matter how difficult the problems were, relying on the masses made them easy to solve. Using the "three-combination" method to compile teaching materials is good! Zhoulou Commune's Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Management Committee for Schools Director Zhang Chongguang said with deep feelings: "The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are the most loyal to Chairman Mao, have the richest experience in the three great revolutionary struggles, and know best what is needed to cultivate successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. This once again proves that Chairman Mao said, 'the lowly are the wisest,' 'the people have boundless creativity,' and 'the people are the true heroes.'"

4. **Teach, Revise, and Supplement Simultaneously**: The comrades of Zhoulou Commune's Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Management Committee for Schools said: "Even if a book of teaching materials is compiled, it cannot be taught lesson by lesson. It must be supplemented according to the situation and tasks. For example, when Chairman Mao issued the latest instructions such as 'seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform,' they were immediately included as compulsory courses, organizing students to learn and guiding them to study and apply what they have learned. They also mobilized students to teach the poor and lower-middle peasants. In this way, they could quickly learn and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and make school work serve the center, serving proletarian politics.

### 贫下中农自编新教材好得很

    贫下中农自编新教材好得很
    河南郸城县吴台公社革命委员会
    我们吴台公社各村的小学，使用一种深受贫下中农、革命师生、革命干部欢迎的教材。这个教材，是在今年七月份普及小学教育的过程中产生的。学生说：这书好懂、好学、好用。教师说：这书好教、易学，有利于学生在德智体诸方面得到发展。生产队干部说：咱编的教材政治性强，配合运动紧密，服务生产好。许多贫下中农说：咱编的教材真好！小孩子头一课就学“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”还有不忘阶级苦，砸烂修字货，连咱种庄稼的经验，教材里也写上啦。能念这样的书，下代就不会变修。
    敢于走前人没有走过的路
    在毛主席教育革命光辉思想的指引下，吴台、周楼、李庄三个大队首先掀起了批判修正主义教育路线，普及小学教育的高潮。贫下中农掌握了文权，小学迅速普及，入学人数由原来的五百八十七人猛增到一千零三十四人。他们没有教师，自己选，没有房子自己腾，没有桌凳自己做，摆在面前的一个突出问题是没有课本，怎么办？当时，有的主张到外地书店买；有的主张向读过一年级的学生借。有的提出：如果借不够，买不到，又怎么办？有的提出：无产阶级文化大革命以前的书有没有毒？也有的说：房子桌凳难不住咱，没书可得上级解决呀！许多人又急又愁。
    周楼大队领导班子组织贫下中农管理学校委员会（当时叫普及小学委员会），带着以上问题学习了毛主席的伟大教导：“人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。停止的论点，悲观的论点，无所作为和骄傲自满的论点，都是错误的。”毛主席的这些教导，照亮了大家的思想，鼓舞了大家的革命热情。县贫农代表杨显武说：“过去认为书是由‘大学问人’、‘专家’编的，咱老百姓干不了。一学毛主席的指示才明白，过去资产阶级知识分子编的书是黑货，是为剥削阶级服务的。我们贫下中农最懂得用什么培养无产阶级革命接班人，对毛主席的无产阶级感情最深，也最有权力编教材。”大队干部张崇光说：“毛主席咋说咱咋办，没有教材自己编。光咱们几个还不够，要和广大贫下中农商量，他们最有办法，最有经验。也叫老师参加。”这样，贫下中农、干部、老师一齐动手，人多力量大，问题就解决了。
    人民群众是真正的英雄
    在周楼大队的带动下，吴台、李庄两个大队也本着毛主席关于“自力更生”的教导，编写教材了。他们根据毛主席对教育革命的一系列指示，紧紧围绕当前三大革命运动的需要，放手发动群众，实行了革命干部、贫下中农和革命教师三结合编写教材的办法，在短短的时间里，编选了一册语文教材，共三十课。广大贫下中农说：“文权在手，农民编书，这真是开天辟地没有过的事。”
    他们的主要经验是：
    一、破字当头，敢字领先。他们在选编教材时，首先学习了毛主席关于“不破不立”的教导，以毛主席的思想为武器，批判了旧教材。贫下中农说：过去的书是“开学了，开学了，背着书包到学校，见了老师敬个礼，见了同学问声好。”一点也不突出无产阶级政治。《小猫钓鱼》、《乌鸦喝水》、《司马光》，乌七八糟的东西都上了书。“房前屋后，种瓜种豆”，能不是中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”的黑货吗！毛主席的教导“教育要革命”，就是对！要不是无产阶级文化大革命，咱们贫下中农还在鼓里坐，中国赫鲁晓夫把下一代引到修正主义，咱也分不清。现在毛主席把文权交给咱，咱一定要把旧教材的黑货除掉，把毛主席的话选上去，让小孩从小就读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，成为毛主席的好学生。
    二、以毛主席的指示为最高原则。他们在学习毛主席的指示，批判旧教材的基础上，经过编选工作，进一步认识到培养无产阶级革命事业接班人，必须用最革命的内容。毛主席的话句句是真理，必须以毛主席语录为最根本的教材，同时还必须遵照毛主席的教育方针、“五·七”指示以及关于“教材要彻底改革”、少而精、阶级斗争是一门主课等教导，紧密围绕农村三大革命斗争需要，照顾学生年龄特点进行选编。第一课就是“毛主席万岁！”其他课文，都要培养学生无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。毛主席关于巩固无产阶级专政的语录占主要地位。教材还结合当前形势、任务和本地区的阶级斗争情况，选了“革命委员会好”等语录，以及门合同志的豪言壮语。又选编了“站在周楼望北京，对毛主席无限忠。扫除一切害人虫，誓死捍卫毛泽东。”“旧社会苦处大，贫下中农没文化。地主老财掌文权，笔尖一勾几万元。”等反映群众对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱，对地主阶级、中国赫鲁晓夫极端憎恨的歌谣。还有“学大寨为革命种田”，“头伏萝卜末伏芥，中伏里头种白菜”等为革命种田的豪言壮语和农谚。
    三、坚持群众路线，放手发动群众，实行贫下中农、干部、教师“三结合”。编选教材时，让贫下中农讨论，你说一条，他说一条，教材就出来了。困难再大，依靠群众就不难，用“三结合”的办法编写教材就是好！周楼大队贫下中农管理学校委员会主任张崇光同志深有体会地说：“广大贫下中农最忠于毛主席，三大革命斗争的经验最丰富，最懂得培养无产阶级革命事业接班人需要讲什么，再一次证明了毛主席说的‘卑贱者最聪明’，‘人民群众有无限的创造力’，‘群众是真正的英雄’。”
    四、边教、边改、边补充。周楼大队贫下中农管理学校委员会的同志说：“教材编了一本，也不能一课一课接着讲，要结合形势、任务，边教边补充。譬如毛主席发表了“认真搞好斗、批、改”等最新指示，随即作为必修课，组织学生学习，引导学生活学活用，并发动学生教给贫下中农学。这样，既能对毛主席的最新指示做到学习快，落实快，又能使学校工作配合中心，为无产阶级政治服务。
