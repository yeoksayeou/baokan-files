I heard from the radio about the letter from teachers Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu of Maji Elementary School in Jiaxiang County, Shandong Province, and the important editorial note from the People's Daily, and I am very excited. It is wonderful that village-run elementary schools are managed by poor and lower-middle peasants.

I was born into a poor peasant family. For generations, we lived in the northern hills of Xuanhua, in the "three gullies and two bays" of the desert. Before liberation, my grandfather and father worked as long-term laborers and did odd jobs for the landlords, but they could not eat enough or keep warm throughout the year. After I was born, because of poor food, my health was weak, and I fell ill, which seriously damaged my health. We waited for the stars and the moon, and finally, we waited for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao to lead us to overturn our fate. When I was eight years old, my father, seeing that I was weak and not very handy, wanted to send me to school to learn some skills to serve the poor and lower-middle peasants. Unexpectedly, that morning, as soon as my father took me to school, the principal saw my appearance and frowned at my father, saying, "Go back quickly. This is a state-run regular school. We don't accept disabled people like you." I heard this and started crying. My father saw me like this and felt very sad. At that time, the poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres in the team were very sympathetic to me and wanted to persuade the principal to take me in, but they had no power to manage the school, and their words were useless. Therefore, the principal still insisted on not taking me in. Finally, my father gritted his teeth and said, "Child, this is not our school. When we poor and lower-middle peasants run a school, Father will send you to school."

A thunderous spring thunder rolled across the sky, and in 1966, our great leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the poor and lower-middle peasants in our village, together with the revolutionary teachers, seized the educational power from the hands of the bourgeois intellectuals and established their own schools, first setting up people-run classes and farming-reading classes, and one batch after another of class sisters entered their own schools.

Chairman Mao said, "Once the power of the landlords is overthrown in the countryside, the cultural movement of the peasants begins."

September 1, 1966, is the most unforgettable day of my life. I never dreamed that this day would come. I walked into the school gate for the first time.

Over the past two years, under the nurturing of the great thought of Mao Zedong and the care of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary teachers, I have made significant progress in both my thoughts and studies.

Looking back at this segment of my life, the more I think about it, the more I feel that Chairman Mao's teaching, "In the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants," is the most brilliant and the greatest. The more I think about it, the more I feel that Chairman Mao cares the most about us poor and lower-middle peasants and is the closest to us.

Teachers Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu suggested that all public elementary schools be run by the production brigades. This is a revolutionary suggestion to further implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. If we act according to this suggestion, the children of poor and lower-middle peasants will no longer be excluded from school.

### 贫下中农子女再也不会受排斥了

　　贫下中农子女再也不会受排斥了
    我从广播里听到了山东省嘉祥县马集小学侯振民、王庆余老师的一封倡议信和《人民日报》的重要编者按，心情十分激动。农村公办小学交给大队办，由贫下中农管理学校好极了。
    我出生在一个贫农的家庭里，祖祖辈辈居住在塞外三沟两湾的宣化北山坡上。解放前，我祖父和父亲整天给大地主扛长工，打短活，一年到头吃不饱，穿不暖。我出生后因为饭食差，体格弱，得了病，严重地损害了我的健康。盼星星，盼月亮，好容易才盼来了共产党，毛主席领导我们翻了身。当我长到八岁的时候，我爹看着我身体差，干活不灵便，想把我送到学校里学点为贫下中农服务的本事。没想到，那天早上，我爹刚把我送到学校，校长一见我的样子，便拧着眉眼对我爹说：“快回去吧，我们这是国家办的正规学校，不收这号残废人。”我一听这话，就呜呜地哭开了。我爹见我这个样子，心里十分难过。当时队里的贫下中农和干部虽然都对我十分同情，想劝说校长把我收下，可是他们并没有管理学校的权力，说话也不顶用，因此那个校长依然坚持不收。最后，我爹咬着牙说了声：“孩子，这不是咱们的学校，啥时咱贫下中农办了学校，爹再送你上学校。”
    春雷一声震天响，一九六六年我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命开始了，我们村里的贫下中农，在毛主席革命路线的指引下，大造了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇在公社的代理人和一小撮牛鬼蛇神的反，从资产阶级知识分子手里夺回了学校教育大权，贫下中农管理了学校，先后办起了民办班和耕读班，一批又一批的阶级姐妹进了自己的学校。
    毛主席说：“农村里地主势力一倒，农民的文化运动便开始了。”
    一九六六年九月一日，这是我一生最难忘的日子，我做梦也想不到的事实现了，我第一次走进了学校的大门。
    两年来，我在伟大的毛泽东思想哺育下，在广大贫下中农和革命教师的关怀下，无论在思想上和学习上都有了明显的长进。
    回想起我的这一段经历，越想越觉得毛主席“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校”的教导，最英明，最伟大，越想越觉得毛主席最关心我们贫下中农，对我们贫下中农最亲。
    侯振民、王庆余老师建议所有公办小学下放到大队来办，这是一个进一步落实毛主席最新指示的革命的建议，如果按照这个建议去办，我们贫下中农子女就再不会被排斥在校外了。
