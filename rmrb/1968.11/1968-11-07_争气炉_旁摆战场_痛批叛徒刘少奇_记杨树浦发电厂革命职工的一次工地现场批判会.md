The sun shone brightly over the Huangpu River. At the Yangshupu Power Plant by the river in Shanghai, power workers gathered in front of China's first advanced high-pressure boiler. They angrily denounced the traitor, inside spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the power industry who promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of "crawling philosophy" and "expert management," strangling the installation of China's first self-designed, self-manufactured advanced high-pressure boiler.

This boiler, which has reached world advanced levels, was installed successfully at high speed and high quality by the workers of the Yangshupu Power Plant with unwavering loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. With the cooperation of more than 160 sister units across the city, they fought hard and installed it. This boiler has boosted the spirit for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and for the Chinese working class. The workers proudly named it the "Spirit-Boosting Furnace." At this moment, the "Spirit-Boosting Furnace" roared with flames, and the machinery hummed. The workers gathered around it, continuously raising their fists and shouting, "Follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and thoroughly carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform!" "Thoroughly settle accounts with the traitor, inside spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes!" The slogans echoed through the entire construction site.

At the criticism meeting, the first to speak was a representative from the electrical workshop. He pointed out to the number one capitalist-roader in the party, Liu Shaoqi's agent at the Yangshupu Power Plant, to open his eyes and see the advanced high-pressure boiler designed and installed by the working class. He angrily exposed the crimes of this small group of capitalist-roaders and bourgeois reactionary "technical authorities" who strangled the installation of this boiler. The revolutionary workers angrily said, "You and Liu Shaoqi are the same, all running dogs of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. You fundamentally do not believe that the Chinese working class has the spirit and ability to catch up with and surpass the world's advanced scientific and technological levels. You bow down to foreigners, promoting the treacherous 'crawling philosophy,' attempting to sabotage socialist construction!" He continued to expose, "This advanced high-pressure boiler was completed as early as 1960. However, Liu Shaoqi's agents in the power industry did not believe in the creativity of the workers, nor did they believe we could install and operate it. They left it in an open field, exposed to the sun and rain, rusting and rotting. At that time, we workers were very saddened, repeatedly requesting installation, but these people, using their usurped power, did not allocate funds or equipment, attempting to strangle this new thing. These people, on the one hand, strangled the enthusiasm of the working class, and on the other hand, traveled to many capitalist countries, trying to import foreign machinery. Some capitalist countries not only demanded high prices but also imposed technological blockades, proposing many unreasonable conditions. Could the working class agree to this?"

"No!" the workers shouted in unison.

"Right! The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The Chinese people have the spirit and ability, and we must catch up with and surpass the world's advanced levels in the not-too-distant future.' Chairman Mao spoke the words of the working class. This time, in the process of installing China's first advanced high-pressure boiler, we encountered many difficulties. However, we workers have a heart that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. We are fearless, daring to trample difficulties underfoot. The entire factory's workers and revolutionary workers from sister units, together, displayed sky-high revolutionary enthusiasm and a high degree of communist cooperative spirit. After 23 days and nights of hard work, we finally successfully installed the 'Spirit-Boosting Furnace.'"

At this moment, the entire venue resonated with thunderous slogans: "Thoroughly criticize the treacherous 'crawling philosophy,' take the road of self-reliance!" "Long live Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!" "Overthrow the running dog of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, Liu Shaoqi!"

"Tell me, how do you control the pressure and temperature of the advanced high-pressure boiler?" an operating worker questioned a bourgeois reactionary "technical authority."

"I... I don't know," the reactionary "technical authority" replied in a trembling voice.

"Tell me, what is the flow rate during water treatment for the advanced high-pressure boiler?" a heat treatment worker questioned another bourgeois reactionary "technical authority."

"I... I don't know," the reactionary "technical authority" replied, shaking his head.

These unlearned bourgeois reactionary "technical authorities" were either loyal running dogs of imperialism, long-term exploiters and oppressors of workers, or traitors and capitalist-roaders. In the past, due to Liu Shaoqi's promotion of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of "expert management," a small group of capitalist-roaders relied on these people to run the enterprise, allowing them to hold technical power and implement bourgeois dictatorship over the workers. The workers angrily pointed out, "Fish love fish, shrimp love shrimp. Liu Shaoqi and his henchmen love these junk! Liu Shaoqi's promotion of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of 'expert management' is to prepare conditions for him to usurp the party, usurp politics, usurp the military, and restore capitalism."

"The working class must lead everything," "The humble are the wisest! The noble are the most foolish." Chairman Mao's great teachings greatly boosted the spirit of the working class and greatly dampened the arrogance of the bourgeoisie. The working class, with heads held high, stepped onto the stage of science and technology, seizing back the technical power from a small group of bourgeois reactionary "technical authorities," breaking through their "control" and "restrictions" over the workers, and displaying boundless creative power.

The revolutionary cadres proudly said: This time, the installation of China's first advanced high-pressure boiler was completed by a technical team composed of workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres, without a single bourgeois technical "authority" or "expert." The facts prove that we, the working class, can trample the bourgeois technical "authorities" and "experts" underfoot in the field of science and technology. In the past, installing a foreign-made boiler, there were several foreign "experts" alone, and various bourgeois technical "authorities." These people did not allow workers to touch technology at all. As a result, it took more than two years to install just one boiler. After the boiler was installed, it exploded shortly after, and the welded joints of the pipes leaked multiple times. In the end, it was the workers who repaired and reworked it, making the boiler operational. This time, the installation of China's first advanced high-pressure boiler, the design, construction, command, and operation were all in the hands of the working class. The result was that the workers, with unprecedented speed, installed it successfully in one go and put it into operation in one go.

The miracles created by the working class, shining with the great thoughts of Mao Zedong, like cannon shells, shattered Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line of "expert management," and thoroughly criticized the small group of capitalist-roaders and bourgeois reactionary "technical authorities" in the factory, leaving them speechless.

Through the revolutionary criticism, the revolutionary workers' spirits were more invigorated, and their fighting spirit was more ardent. They, with victorious enthusiasm, decided to follow the direction indicated by the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee and launch new battles.

    “争气炉”旁摆战场　痛批叛徒刘少奇
    ——记杨树浦发电厂革命职工的一次工地现场批判会
    黄浦江上阳光灿烂。江畔的上海杨树浦发电厂里，电业工人们齐集在我国第一台新式高压锅炉前面，愤怒声讨叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇和他在电业系统的代理人推行“爬行哲学”、“专家治厂”的反革命修正主义路线，扼杀我国第一台自己设计、自己制造的新式高压锅炉的安装工程的罪行。
    这台具有世界先进水平的新式高压锅炉，是杨树浦发电厂工人怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚，经过艰苦奋战，在全市一百六十多个兄弟单位的共同协作下，高速度、优质量地安装成功的。这台锅炉，为毛主席革命路线争了气，为中国工人阶级争了气，工人们自豪地把它称为“争气炉”。此刻，“争气炉”烈火熊熊，机声隆隆，聚集在炉旁的工人们不断振臂高呼：“紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，认真搞好斗、批、改！”“彻底清算叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的滔天罪行！”口号声一浪高过一浪，响彻了整个工地的上空。
    在批判会上，电气车间的革命职工代表第一个上台发言。他要被揪到会场的党内头号走资派刘少奇在杨树浦发电厂的代理人睁开眼睛看看工人阶级自己设计、安装的这台新式高压锅炉，并且愤怒地揭发了这一小撮走资派和资产阶级反动技术“权威”扼杀这台锅炉的安装工程的罪行。革命职工愤怒地说：“你们和刘少奇一样，都是帝、修、反的走狗。你们根本不相信中国工人阶级有志气、有能力赶上和超过世界先进科学技术水平。你们拜倒在洋人的脚下，推行卖国主义的‘爬行哲学’，妄想破坏社会主义建设！”他继续揭发说，“这台新式高压锅炉，早在一九六○年已经出厂。但是刘少奇在电业系统的代理人，不相信我们工人的创造能力，更不相信我们能够安装和操作，把它丢在露天场地里，任它日晒雨淋，生锈变烂。当时，我们工人看了十分痛心，三番五次要求安装上马，但这些家伙利用他们窃取的权力，就是不拨资金，不给设备，妄图扼杀这个新生事物。这些家伙一方面扼杀工人阶级的积极性，一方面却周游不少资本主义国家，千方百计想进口洋机器。有些资本主义国家，不但索取高价，而且在技术上进行封锁，提出了许多不合理的条件。我们工人阶级能答应吗？”
    “不答应！”工人们齐声回答。
    “对！伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：‘中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平。’毛主席说出了我们工人阶级的心里话。这次，在安装我国第一台新式高压锅炉的过程中，我们曾经遇到许多困难，但是，我们工人有一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心，天不怕、地不怕，敢于把困难踩在脚底下。全厂工人和兄弟单位革命职工一起，发扬冲天的革命干劲和高度的共产主义协作精神，经过二十三个日日夜夜的奋战，终于胜利地把这台‘争气炉’跃上了马。”
    这时，全场响起了响彻云霄的口号声：“彻底批判卖国主义的‘爬行哲学’，走自力更生的道路！”“毛主席的革命路线胜利万岁！”“打倒帝国主义、现代修正主义和国民党反动派的走狗刘少奇！”
    “我问你：新式高压锅炉气压气温怎样控制？”运行工人考问一个资产阶级反动技术“权威”。
    “我……我不知道。”反动技术“权威”用颤抖的声音回答。
    “我问你：新式高压锅炉水处理时流速多少？”热化工人考问另一个资产阶级反动技术“权威”。
    “我……我不知道。”反动技术“权威”摇晃着脑袋回答。
    这些不学无术的资产阶级反动技术“权威”，有的是帝国主义的忠实走狗，有的是长期剥削、压迫工人的资本家，有的是叛徒、工贼。过去，由于刘少奇推行“专家治厂”的反革命修正主义路线，一小撮走资派就是依靠这些家伙办企业，让他们掌握技术大权，对工人实行资产阶级专政。工人们愤怒地指出，“鱼爱鱼，虾爱虾，刘少奇和他的爪牙爱的就是这些废料！刘少奇推行反革命修正主义的‘专家治厂’路线，就是为他篡党、篡政、篡军，复辟资本主义准备条件。”
    “工人阶级必须领导一切”，“卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢”。毛主席的伟大教导，大长了工人阶级的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风。工人阶级昂首阔步登上了科学技术舞台，从一小撮资产阶级反动技术“权威”手里夺回了技术大权，冲破了他们“管”“卡”工人的条条框框，发挥了无穷的创造伟力。
    无产阶级革命派自豪地说：这次，安装我国第一台新式高压锅炉，没有一个资产阶级技术“权威”、“专家”，完全是由用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人和革命知识分子、革命领导干部结合的技术小组来完成的。事实证明，我们工人阶级在科学技术上能够把资产阶级技术“权威”、“专家”踩在脚下。过去，安装一台外国制造的锅炉，光是洋“专家”就有好几个，还有各色各样的资产阶级技术“权威”。这些人不让工人在技术上沾一点边。结果，光一台锅炉就安装了两年多时间。炉子上去后没多久，炉膛爆炸，管子的焊口发生多次漏水，最后还是由工人把它返工重做，才使炉子能够运行。这次安装我国第一台新式高压锅炉，设计、施工、指挥、操作的大权统统掌握在工人阶级手里，结果，工人们以从来没有过的高速度，一次安装成功，一次投入运行。
    工人阶级创造的这些闪耀着伟大的毛泽东思想光辉的奇迹，象一发发炮弹，把刘少奇反革命修正主义的“专家治厂”路线打得稀烂，把厂里的一小撮走资派和资产阶级反动技术“权威”批得体无完肤，哑口无言。
    通过革命大批判，革命职工精神更加振奋，斗志更加昂扬，他们满怀着胜利的豪情，决心沿着党的八届扩大的十二中全会所指引的航向，投入新的战斗。
