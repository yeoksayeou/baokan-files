	Strikes and Protests, Occupying Campuses, and Armed Resistance
	Progressive Students in the U.S. Intensify Their Struggle Against Racial Discrimination
	Peasants in Some Latin American Countries Continue to Fight Against Exploitation by the U.S. and Local Landlords

	Xinhua News Agency, November 22nd: Washington reports that recently, black and white students from various colleges and universities across the United States have bravely conducted strikes, protests, occupied campuses, hunger strikes, and armed resistance against the savage suppression by the police. They are protesting against the capitalist educational system's racial discrimination against blacks and the U.S. imperialist aggression in Vietnam.

	Students from San Francisco State College in California began a continuous strike on November 6th, protesting the dismissal of a black lecturer who defended the self-defense rights of black students. On the 13th, striking students engaged in a fierce battle with the fascist police who came to suppress them. The entire college was forced to close for a week. On the 21st, the college administration held talks with student representatives. During the talks, the administration unreasonably rejected the students' legitimate demands, further exposing its reactionary nature. Subsequently, thousands of black students, with the support of many white students, held a massive protest on campus and bravely fought against the large number of police who entered the campus to suppress the protest. The students' resistance shattered the reactionary authorities' plan to force them back to class.

	At the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, over a hundred black students occupied the president's office on the 21st, demanding that the president meet their reasonable demands, including recognizing black student organizations and hiring black teachers. After their demands were rejected, the black students held a protest and smashed the windows and typewriters in the president's office, expressing their strong indignation against the school administration's unreasonable actions.

	Students at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana have been holding continuous protests in recent days, opposing the school's collusion with the Central Intelligence Agency and Dow Chemical Company, which manufactures napalm for the Vietnam War. Over thirty students went on a hunger strike for this cause. On the 20th, several dozen students lay down at the school gate, blocking CIA personnel from entering the campus. Students at the University of Colorado have also recently launched a struggle against Dow Chemical Company's recruitment activities on their campus.

	According to Xinhua News Agency on the 20th, peasants in some Latin American countries have recently been waging a tenacious struggle against the brutal enslavement and exploitation by the U.S. and local landlords.

	At the end of October, in various places in Guayas Province, Ecuador, large-scale peasant land seizures occurred. On October 28th, six hundred landless peasants occupied part of the "Solidad" plantation in Naranjal County, owned by American capital "Ecuador Plantations." At the same time, in El Enpalme, Guayaquil, Milagro, and Guabo, peasants also carried out a series of land seizures.

	During the same period, agricultural workers in the "Prospect," "Pimocha," and "Guajara" farms in Guayas Province held strikes, protesting against the exploitation and oppression by the landlords.

	At the end of October, in the Cospan region of Cajamarca Province, Peru, peasants occupied the "Culquimarca" plantation. They used stones and other means to resist the armed suppression by the reactionaries, shattered the reactionaries' attacks, and defended the land they had occupied.

	In Chile, over six thousand agricultural workers in O'Higgins Province recently announced an indefinite strike, demanding land.
