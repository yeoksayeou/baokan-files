The enlarged Twelfth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, presided over by Chairman Mao Zedong, was held in Beijing from October 13 to 31, 1968. This session is of great historical significance for the future of the Chinese people and for the revolutionary and socialist cause of the world.

The session was held at a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution had achieved great victories, and the thought of Mao Zedong, representing Marxism-Leninism, had also achieved great victories. It was held at a time when the revolutionary movements of the people of all countries were developing vigorously and fundamentally shaking the imperialist camp headed by U.S. imperialism and the modern revisionist camp headed by the Khrushchevite renegade clique.

The communiqué already issued indicates that at this enlarged plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chairman Mao made a very important speech on the question of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution since the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee in August 1966, and Vice Chairman Lin Biao made an important speech. The plenary session unanimously adopted a series of resolutions. For the glorious Communist Party of China, these are extremely important documents and are also new and extremely powerful weapons in the hands of the Communist Party members and the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses to push the revolution forward in China, to further strengthen and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, to block the channels for the restoration of capitalism and revisionism, and to advance courageously on the road to socialism and communism.

Since the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have achieved great victories in all fields. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has achieved great and decisive victories. Now, except for Taiwan Province, revolutionary committees, which are new organs of proletarian dictatorship, have been established in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. This historic victory has made China ten times stronger and ensured that China will forever remain red. The People's Republic of China is now a great power with strong economic and military potential. Her international prestige is growing day by day, and she is playing an increasingly important role in the world. As the communiqué of the enlarged Twelfth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China points out, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great driving force for socialist production in our country. It is promoting and will continue to promote a new leap in our socialist construction."

The two years since the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China have been a glorious period in the history of the Communist Party of China and all the Chinese people. This period has been marked by fierce struggles between two classes, two lines, and two roads. The essence of this struggle is the question of power, the question of whether the leadership of the Party and the state is in the hands of Marxist-Leninists or revisionists. In the course of this fierce class struggle, hundreds of millions of revolutionary workers, peasants, and soldiers and intellectuals of the Chinese people have unreservedly supported the Marxist-Leninist thought of Comrade Mao Zedong. They have been educated and tempered politically and ideologically and have raised their revolutionary consciousness.

Through this great revolutionary struggle, the headquarters of the bourgeoisie, represented by Liu Shaoqi—the mad and dangerous enemy of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people—has been thoroughly exposed and smashed. Liu Shaoqi and his agents in various places had tried to usurp the Party, the government, and the army. The enlarged Twelfth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China expressed the wishes and will of the Communist Party members and the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses, unanimously adopting a resolution to expel Liu Shaoqi, the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, the traitor and splitist hidden in the Party, the running dog of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, from the Party forever, to remove him from all his posts inside and outside the Party, and to continue to settle accounts with Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices for their crimes of betraying the Party and the nation.

To expose the counter-revolutionary features of this traitor and enemy of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people and his accomplices is a great victory for Mao Zedong's thought, a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and a smashing blow to the counter-revolutionary dreams and plots of U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries against China.

According to the instructions of Chairman Mao and the tasks put forward by this plenary session, the Party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat and should be a vigorous vanguard organization capable of leading the proletariat and the revolutionary masses in the struggle against the class enemy. The instructions of Chairman Mao and the tasks put forward by the plenary session have made the ranks of the glorious Communist Party of China—the indispensable leading force for carrying the revolution and the socialist cause through to the end in China—more closely united. The plenary session's principles on the leadership of the working class in everything, on the dictatorship of the proletariat in the superstructure, on the tasks of the struggle, criticism, and transformation in each stage, and on the implementation of revolutionary great alliances and the three-in-one combination are powerful and reliable weapons for the Communist Party members and all the revolutionary masses of China to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end and to achieve victory in all fields.

In the course of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Communist Party of China has purged alien elements. The Party has weathered the storms of class struggle, has become more ideologically firm, and has undergone greater tempering. After the storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, conditions have been created in terms of ideology, politics, and organization for the convening of the Ninth National Congress of the Party. The plenary session decided to convene the Ninth National Congress of the Party at an appropriate time. This congress will sum up the victories already achieved and open up new, brilliant prospects.

The great victories achieved by the 700 million Chinese people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the historic decisions made by the enlarged Twelfth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China have great significance not only for the People's Republic of China but also for the Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary forces of all countries. The enlarged Twelfth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was convened at a time when the world revolution has entered a great new era. Today, the People's Republic of China, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has become a strong bastion of world socialism and communism, a strong base for world revolution, a standard-bearer of Marxism-Leninism, and a staunch and unyielding defender of the struggles of the peoples of all countries for freedom and national independence. In the face of the giant of China, in the face of the resolute struggle of China for the revolutionary and socialist cause, all the counter-revolutionary anti-China plots of the two so-called superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, have met with and will continue to meet with miserable failure.

The Party of Labor of Albania and the entire Albanian people resolutely support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by the great Marxist-Leninist Mao Zedong. Comrade Enver Hoxha has expressed the feelings of our Party and people towards the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. He said: "The establishment of the revolutionary committees marks the victory of Mao Zedong's thought and revolutionary line over the reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev, the victory of the dictatorship of the proletariat and socialism over revisionism and capitalism. The counter-revolutionary plots have been thoroughly smashed and destroyed, and the dreams and plots of the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and international reactionaries to seize the fortress from within and invade have turned to ashes."

Our Communist Party members and the entire people sincerely rejoice in and congratulate these great victories and the bright prospects facing the fraternal Chinese people. The historic decisions made by the enlarged Twelfth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China indicate that under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China headed by the great Marxist-Leninist Mao Zedong, the Chinese people will forever hold high and gloriously the red flag of revolution and socialism, marching with firm steps towards more brilliant new victories.

    中国人民革命和社会主义事业的伟大的历史性事件
    阿《人民之声报》发表社论热烈欢呼中国共产党第八届扩大的十二中全会的成功
    新华社地拉那三日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》三日发表题为《中国人民革命和社会主义事业的伟大的历史性事件》的社论，热烈欢呼中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会的成功。社论全文如下：
    由中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东同志主持的，一九六八年十月十三日至三十一日在北京举行的中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会，对于中国人民的前途，对于世界的革命和社会主义的事业来说，是具有伟大历史意义的重大事件。
    这次全会是在无产阶级文化大革命取得了伟大胜利、毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义思想取得了伟大胜利的大好形势下举行的，是在世界各国人民的革命运动正在蓬勃发展并从根本上动摇了以美帝为首的帝国主义、以苏修叛徒集团为首的现代修正主义的时刻举行的。
    已经发表的公报指出，在中国共产党这次扩大的中央委员会全会上，毛泽东主席就一九六六年八月党的八届十一中全会以来无产阶级文化大革命运动的问题，作了极其重要的讲话，林彪副主席作了重要的讲话，全会一致通过了各项决议。对于光荣的中国共产党来说，这些都是意义极为重大的文献，也是掌握在中国共产党人和亿万革命群众手中的新的非常强大的武器，以便在中国把革命不断推向前进，进一步加强和巩固无产阶级专政，杜绝出现修正主义和资本主义复辟的渠道，在社会主义和共产主义的道路上奋勇前进。
    中国共产党第八届第十一次中央委员会全会以来的两年中，中国人民在各方面所取得的胜利是伟大的。毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命取得了伟大的、决定性的胜利。现在，中国除台湾省外，各省、市、自治区都成立了无产阶级专政的新的革命权力机构——革命委员会。这一具有历史意义的胜利，使中国百倍地强大了，使中国永远保持鲜红的颜色。中华人民共和国现在是一个拥有强大的经济和军事潜力的大国，她的国际威望日益增长，在国际上起着越来越重大的作用。正如中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会公报所指出的，“无产阶级文化大革命是我国社会主义生产的伟大推动力。它正在促进并将继续促进我国的社会主义建设出现新的飞跃。”
    中国共产党第八届第十一次中央委员会全会以来的两年，是中国共产党和全中国人民的一个光荣的历史阶段。这个时期贯串着两个阶级、两条道路和两条路线的剧烈斗争。这场斗争的实质，是政权问题，是党和国家的领导权掌握在马克思列宁主义者或修正主义者手里的问题。在这场剧烈的阶级斗争过程中，中国亿万工农兵革命群众和人民知识分子无保留地拥护毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义思想，他们在政治上和思想上受到了教育，得到了锻炼，提高了革命觉悟。
    经过这场伟大的革命斗争，彻底揭露和摧毁了以刘少奇——中国共产党和中国人民的疯狂而危险的敌人——为代表的资产阶级司令部，刘少奇及其在各地的代理人曾竭力篡党、篡政、篡军。中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会表达了中国共产党人和亿万革命群众的愿望和意志，一致通过决议：把党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，埋藏在党内的叛徒和分裂主义者，帝国主义、现代修正主义和国民党反动派的走狗刘少奇，永远开除出党，撤消其党内外的一切职务，并继续清算刘少奇及其同伙叛党叛国的罪行。
    把中国共产党和中国人民的这个叛徒和敌人及其同伙的反革命面貌揭露出来，这是毛泽东思想的一个极其伟大的胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的一个极其伟大的胜利，是对美帝、苏修和各国反动派反华的反革命迷梦和计划的粉碎性打击。
    根据毛泽东主席的指示和这次全会提出的任务，党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。毛泽东主席的指示和全会提出的任务，使光荣的中国共产党——将革命和社会主义事业在中国进行到底的必不可少的领导力量——的队伍团结得更加紧密。全会关于工人阶级必须领导一切，关于在上层建筑实行无产阶级专政，实现斗、批、改各个阶段的任务，以及关于实行革命大联合和革命三结合的原则，是中国共产党人和全中国革命群众把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，直到在各个领域里取得胜利的强大和可靠的武器。
    在无产阶级文化大革命的过程中，中国共产党清洗了异己分子。党经历了阶级斗争的风浪，思想上更加坚强了，受到了更大的锻炼。经过无产阶级文化大革命的风暴，已经从思想上、政治上、组织上为召开党的第九次全国代表大会准备了条件，全会决定在适当的时候召开党的第九次全国代表大会。这次代表大会将对已经取得的胜利进行总结，开辟新的光辉灿烂的前景。
    七亿中国人民在无产阶级文化大革命中所取得的伟大胜利，中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会所作出的具有历史意义的决定，不仅对人民中国，而且对各国马克思列宁主义者和革命力量都具有伟大的意义。中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会是在世界革命进入了一个伟大的新时代的时候召开的，今天，经受了无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的人民中国，已成为世界社会主义和共产主义的强大堡垒，成为世界革命的强大基地，成为马克思列宁主义的旗手，成为各国人民争取自由和民族独立的斗争的坚决的毫不动摇的捍卫者。在中国巨人面前，在中国为革命和社会主义事业所进行的坚决斗争面前，两个所谓的世界超级大国美国和苏联的一切反革命的反华阴谋，统统遭到了并且必将继续遭到悲惨的失败。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和全体阿尔巴尼亚人民坚决支持由伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志领导的无产阶级文化大革命。恩维尔·霍查同志表达了我们党和我国人民对中国无产阶级文化大革命胜利的思想感情。他说：“革命委员会的建立，标志着毛泽东同志的思想和革命路线对中国赫鲁晓夫反动路线的胜利，标志着无产阶级专政和社会主义对修正主义和资本主义的胜利。反革命阴谋被彻底打垮和粉碎了，美帝国主义者、苏联修正主义者和国际反动派企图从内部夺取堡垒的反华梦想和侵略阴谋化成灰烬了。”
    我国共产党人和全体人民对这些伟大的胜利和展现在兄弟的中国人民面前的光辉的前景，表示由衷的高兴和祝贺。中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会所作出的具有历史意义的决定表明，在以伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党的领导下，中国人民将永远更高地和光荣地举起革命和社会主义的红旗，迈着坚定的步伐，向着更加辉煌的新的胜利前进。
