My family has twelve members. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, through the active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, especially through the establishment of a Mao Zedong Thought family study class, the spiritual outlook of the entire family has undergone profound changes.

In the past, my father was unhappy that my younger brother and I were busy with collective work and did not manage household affairs. We were also dissatisfied with my father and second brother's attitude of only caring for themselves and not the collective. We must arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, so that the whole family will always listen to Chairman Mao and follow him in the revolution. Once, the brigade reduced the work points for each fruit basket made by the members in their spare time by two points. My second brother, feeling it was too little, in a fit of anger, kept all 140-plus baskets he had made and refused to hand them over to the brigade. I asked him, "Are you working for work points or for the collective?" He said, "Without work points, what do we eat? We'll starve!" I said, "You are putting the 'self' first and the work points first. You are deeply poisoned by the traitor Liu Shaoqi!" He angrily said, "In the future, when you speak, you must consider the seniority."

My father and second brother tried to use the old family tradition of "respecting the elderly" to suppress us. My younger brother, I, and fifth brother made efforts to propagate Mao Zedong Thought to them. The ideological struggle became more intense, and the situation became more deadlocked.

One day, I said, "The matters in our family cannot be resolved through argument. Let's establish a Mao Zedong Thought study class and consult Chairman Mao on any issues." My father and second brother agreed.

After the study class was organized, we led the whole family to recall past sufferings and think of present happiness, arousing everyone's class feelings for Chairman Mao. At the beginning, I said to my father, "Dad, you are always thinking about earning work points and making money. You have long forgotten the sufferings of the past." This remark aroused my father's memories. He said, "Even if I am buried in the yellow earth, I will never forget the sufferings of the old society." Then he began to recount everything in detail. The more he talked, the more sad he became, and the more we listened, the more excited we became. After recalling the sufferings, our whole family studied Chairman Mao's teaching that "only socialism can save China" and discussed the principle that not listening to Chairman Mao, harming the public interest for personal gain, would lead to double suffering. This way, my father's mind began to change. After a long silence, he said, "Listening to you, I realize that I have gone astray in the past few years." My second brother also realized his mistake and expressed his willingness to study Chairman Mao's works and hand over the fruit baskets he had kept to the collective.

Not long ago, the poor and lower-middle peasants saw that our family studied Chairman Mao's works well and selected my father as the livestock keeper. However, my father listened to bad words from others and soon refused to do the job. My siblings and I discussed it and decided to help him through the family study class. When my father found out, he got very angry: "Are you trying to rebel against your father? Your father stood guard and sent messages for the Eighth Route Army during the Anti-Japanese War, and was an active member during the land reform. Although I had a bit of 'self' in the past few years, I have corrected my mistakes after studying Chairman Mao's works. What else do you want me to do?" At this time, my second brother calmly recited a quotation from Chairman Mao: "Do not rely on past merits, but strive to create new ones." Chairman Mao's teaching made my father immediately realize that his attitude was wrong. He should not rely on past merits but continuously reform his thoughts and make progress. Then, we helped him analyze the pros and cons of being or not being a livestock keeper. After this analysis, my father said, "I was really confused. I took bad words as good ones and almost fell into the trap. This is my disloyalty to Chairman Mao. I will correct my mistakes." He also said, "In the past, two people fed the pigs and donkeys. This time, I will take care of everything."

Later, we felt that my father's thoughts often fluctuated, one of the reasons being that the roots of revisionism were not thoroughly uprooted. Therefore, we held a special criticism meeting to sweep away the poison of Liu Shaoqi's "work points first" and "material incentives." First, we studied Chairman Mao's teaching that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," and then we criticized Liu Shaoqi.

Through the criticism meeting, our whole family greatly raised our awareness of the struggle between the two lines, realized that competing for work points was wrong, and established the new trend of honoring labor. My father not only did a good job as a livestock keeper but also tried to find time to work for the collective, such as plowing fields, building walls, and pruning fruit trees. Now, our family has put forward a slogan with three honest words: honestly loyal to Chairman Mao, honestly listen to Chairman Mao's words, and honestly act according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

### 毛泽东思想在我家扎下了根

专栏：在毛泽东思想学习班里

    毛泽东思想在我家扎下了根
    我家有十二口人。在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，通过活学活用毛泽东思想，特别是通过办毛泽东思想家庭学习班，全家人的精神面貌发生了深刻的变化。
    早先，我父亲对我和四哥忙于集体的事，不大管家里的事，心里窝了一肚子火。我们对父亲和二哥那种只顾自己，不管集体的态度，也早就不满意了。一定要用毛泽东思想武装他们的头脑，使全家永远听毛主席的话，紧跟毛主席干革命。有一次，队里把社员利用业余时间编的水果篓子每个降了两分工，二哥嫌少，一赌气把编好的一百四十多个篓子全扣下，说啥也不交给队里了。我问他：“你是为工分干活，还是为集体干活？”他说：“没有工分吃什么，喝西北风去！”我又说：“你这是私字当头，工分挂帅，真是受叛徒刘少奇的毒太深了！”他气呼呼地说：“你今后说话，眼睛里得有个老少大小。”
    我父亲和二哥想用“以老压小”的旧家风来压我们；我和四哥、五弟就努力向他们宣传毛泽东思想。思想斗争越来越激烈，越闹越僵。
    有一天，我说：“咱们家里的事，一时半晌辩论不清。咱们成立一个毛泽东思想学习班，有事请教毛主席。”父亲和二哥也同意。
    学习班组织起来后，我们就组织全家忆苦思甜，激发大家对毛主席的阶级感情。开始，我对父亲说：“爸爸，你整天想捞工分发家，过去的苦早就忘干净了。”这一说，引起了父亲的回忆。他说：“你爸入了黄土，旧社会的苦也忘不掉。”接着，他就一五一十地说开了。他越说越伤心，全家人越听越激动。忆苦之后，我们全家学习了毛主席“只有社会主义能够救中国”的教导，还谈了不听毛主席的话，损公利己，就得吃二茬苦的道理。这么一来，我父亲的脑筋就活动开了。他沉闷了好久以后说：“听你们这么一说，这几年我走偏了道了。”我二哥也认识到自己错了，表示要好好学习毛主席著作，把原来扣下的水果篓交给集体。
    不久前，贫下中农看我家学习毛主席著作不错，就选我父亲当饲养员。可是，父亲听信了别人的坏话，干了一阵就说啥也不干了。我兄妹几个一商量，就想通过家庭学习班帮助他。父亲知道了，就大发脾气：“你们要造老子的反吗？你爸在抗日战争时给八路军站过岗，送过信，土改的时候又是积极分子。这几年虽然有点‘私’字，经过学习毛主席著作早就认错改错了，你们还叫我怎么样？”这时，我二哥平心静气地念了一条毛主席语录：“不要吃老本，要立新功。”毛主席的教导，使我父亲立刻意识到自己的态度不对，不应该吃老本，应该不断改造自己的思想，不断进步。随后，我们又帮助他摆了当与不当饲养员的利害关系。这么一摆，父亲就说：“我真是老糊涂了，把坏话当好话听，又差一点上了当，这是我对毛主席不忠。我要知错就改。”他还说：“过去喂猪喂驴两个人，这一回我全包了。”
    后来，我们感到，父亲思想时常反复，原因之一是修根挖得不狠。于是，我们根据家里人的活思想，搞了一次肃清叛徒刘少奇散布的“工分挂帅”、“物质刺激”的专题批判会。我们首先学习了毛主席“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，然后向叛徒刘少奇开了炮。
    通过批判会，使我们全家大大提高了两条路线斗争觉悟，认识到争工分不对，树立了劳动光荣的新风尚。我父亲不光当好饲养员，还尽量抽出时间为集体耧地、垒坝墙、剪接果树，放下这样活就干那样活。现在，我们家提出了一个口号，叫三句老实话：老老实实忠于毛主席，老老实实听毛主席的话，老老实实照毛主席指示办事。
