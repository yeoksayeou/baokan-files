The news of the issuance of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has spread like a mighty east wind across the country. The entire nation is in high spirits.

The heroic soldiers guarding the frontlines against imperialism and revisionism on the great motherland's frontlines are also in a state of excitement. Along the thousands of miles of coastal defenses and the ten thousand miles of borders, everywhere is filled with the sound of drums and gongs, and the fluttering of battle flags. "Warmly hail the issuance of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Ten thousand years of long live Chairman Mao!" The cheers drown out the rolling waves of the southeastern coast and overwhelm the howling winds and snow of the northern borders.

Excitement on the Cannon Positions

On the coastal defense lines of the motherland, the cannons stand tall, facing the Taiwan Strait and the possible invasion routes of the American and Chiang Kai-shek bandits. In the night, they appear even more majestic and imposing. To defend the coastal defenses, to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to defend Chairman Mao, the artillery soldiers vigilantly guard their battle stations.

The loudspeaker broadcast the joyous news: The communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has been issued. Immediately, the positions erupted in excitement, and cheers and slogans reverberated through the skies. The coastal defense soldiers, moved, repeatedly shouted: "Firmly respond to the great battle call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party!" "We must further consolidate national defense!" "We must liberate Taiwan!"

On the frontline positions along the Gulf of Tonkin, the soldiers of a certain anti-aircraft artillery company, who have been honored as "Four Goods" for seven consecutive years, immediately held a discussion after hearing the broadcast. Deputy Commander Chen Wei and Deputy Squad Leader Pang Yueying, whose homes are near the Sino-Vietnamese border, angrily exposed the heinous crimes of the American aggressors based on what they had heard and seen. The soldiers, with high morale, declared: If the American aggressors dare to stretch out their claws, we will definitely crush them under the Five Fingers Mountain!

On the frontline in Fujian, as soon as the radio finished broadcasting the communiqué, from the positions of the high-angle cannons pointing skyward to the radar stations and observation posts that vigilantly monitor and search for enemy activities day and night, cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years of long live Chairman Mao!" erupted from all directions. The soldiers of the Third Artillery Company also invited workers and poor and lower-middle peasants to study the communiqué on the cannon positions, to jointly denounce the crimes of the American and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and to jointly condemn the traitor, spy, and scab Siu Ming. The workers and poor and lower-middle peasants stood on the cannon platforms, caressing the cannons, and excitedly told the soldiers: "This cannon is given to us by Chairman Mao. Now, the American imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek clique are still harming the people. You must deal with this pack of wolves fiercely!" The soldiers, filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, loudly recited Chairman Mao's quotations and solemnly swore in front of the high-angle cannons: "Our cannon muzzles and gun barrels will definitely be aimed at the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries and all class enemies. We will definitely liberate Taiwan!"

Building the Anti-Revisionist Frontline into an Iron Wall

The joyous news of the issuance of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party reached the border defense troops stationed on the anti-revisionist frontline, greatly encouraging the border defense soldiers. The border defense soldiers, with excited hearts, neatly copied the communiqué into their notebooks, carried the communiqué on patrol and sentry duty, and felt an endless surge of strength.

On the evening of November 1, the soldiers of a certain "Four Goods" border defense station in Heilongjiang Province listened to the broadcast and immediately held a meeting to pledge their loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. Then, they took the communiqué they had just recorded and went to the nearby production brigade militia company at night to spread the joyous news to the poor and lower-middle peasants and militia. The military and civilians jointly warmly hailed the issuance of the communiqué, jointly formulated measures to implement the communiqué, and decided to further launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's thoughts, and to build an iron wall against revisionism with the invincible thoughts of Chairman Mao. Squads of military-civilian patrols set out. They faced the cold wind, carefully patrolled, and were ready to annihilate any invading enemy at any time.

The soldiers of a certain border defense detachment in Inner Mongolia, after listening to the communiqué, reviewed the great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past two years, and their hearts surged with emotion and blood boiled. The soldiers, holding the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and made a steel oath: They would definitely study the communiqué seriously, enthusiastically propagate the communiqué, firmly implement the communiqué, and bravely defend the communiqué; they would definitely heighten their revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, defend the borders, defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and defend the socialist mountains and rivers of the motherland for eternity. That night, the border defense soldiers went from one pastoral point to another to spread the joyous news to the pastoral masses, armed the masses with the invincible thoughts of Chairman Mao, and further built an iron wall of Chairman Mao's thoughts on the anti-revisionist frontline.

Snow Mountain Soldiers Forever Loyal to Chairman Mao!

The joyous news reached the snowy mountain pass in the southwestern border of the motherland. The soldiers of the Eighth Company of a certain unit stationed here gathered in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and held a grand celebration. "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Ten thousand years of long live Chairman Mao!" The cheers echoed through the snowy mountain valleys.

The soldiers came to the iron wire fence, fortress, and shell casings left by the British imperialists when they invaded China and the shell casings left by the Japanese imperialists when they massacred the Chinese people, and repeatedly studied the communiqué, angrily denounced the traitor, spy, and scab Siu Ming. Squad Leader He Yanliang, holding a shell casing and pointing at the iron wire fence, angrily said: "Siu Ming, this big villain, peddles the theory of 'class struggle extinction,' trying to make us lose class vigilance and achieve his evil goals of usurping the Party, usurping the government, and usurping the military. Siu Ming is a heinous criminal and a running dog of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries. Down with Siu Ming!"

To express their firm response to the great call of the communiqué, "We must continuously strengthen the great People's Liberation Army of China and further consolidate national defense," the soldiers inscribed on the snowy mountain pass with stones the words "Heart Turned to Chairman Mao, Rooted on the Snowy Mountain Top" in characters tens of meters high. Facing Chairman Mao's portrait, they solemnly swore: Dear Chairman Mao, the snow mountain soldiers are forever loyal to you! We will definitely remember your great teachings of "never forget class struggle," heighten our vigilance a hundredfold, firmly grasp the guns in our hands, stand guard and keep watch on the snowy mountain pass to defend the motherland's borders. If the enemy dares to invade, we will definitely annihilate them completely and thoroughly!

    无限忠于伟大统帅毛主席  随时准备歼灭敢于来犯之敌
    ——反帝反修前哨战士热烈欢呼公报发表
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表的喜讯，有如浩荡东风，迅速传遍全国各地。举国上下，一片欢腾。
    警惕地守卫在伟大祖国反帝反修前哨阵地上的英雄战士们也沸腾起来了。千里海防，万里边疆，到处锣鼓喧天，战旗飘扬。“热烈欢呼党的八届十二中全会公报的发表！”“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”的欢呼声，盖过了东南海疆的滚滚波涛，压倒了北国边防的风雪狂啸。
    炮阵地上的欢腾
    祖国千里海防的炮阵地上，一尊尊大炮对着台湾海峡，对着美蒋飞贼可能入侵的方向，在夜色中显得格外威武雄壮。为了保卫海防，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，保卫毛主席，炮兵战士警惕地守卫在战斗岗位上。
    广播喇叭传来了特大喜讯：党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表了。顿时，阵地上一片欢腾，欢呼声、口号声响彻云霄。海防战士激动地不断高呼：“坚决响应党的八届十二中全会提出的伟大战斗号召！”“我们一定要进一步巩固国防！”“我们一定要解放台湾！”
    在北部湾沿岸的前哨阵地，连续七年荣获“四好”的某部高炮三连指战员，听了广播以后，立即举行座谈讨论。家在邻近中越边界的副连长陈威和副班长庞跃英，以他们耳闻目睹的事实，愤怒揭发美国侵略强盗的滔天罪行。战士们斗志昂扬地表示：美国强盗胆敢伸一伸它的魔爪，我们就坚决把它压在五指山下！
    在福建前线，电台刚播送完一遍公报，从一门门昂首迎空的高炮的阵地到日夜百倍警惕地监视和搜索敌人活动的雷达站、观察哨，四面八方顿时爆发出一片“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”的欢呼声。炮三连指战员还请来工人、贫下中农，在炮阵地上一起学习公报，和工人、贫下中农一起愤怒控诉美蒋罪行，一起愤怒声讨叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇。工人、贫下中农站在炮盘上，抚摸着大炮，激动地对战士们说：“这炮是毛主席交给咱们的。现在，美帝、苏修和蒋介石反动派还在残害人民，你们要狠狠地对付这群豺狼！”战士们满怀革命豪情，高声背诵毛主席语录，并且列队站在高炮前庄严宣誓：“我们的炮口和枪口一定对准帝、修、反和一切阶级敌人，我们一定要解放台湾！”
    把反修前哨建成钢铁长城
    党的八届十二中全会公报发表的喜讯传到驻守在反修前哨的边防部队，给边防战士带来了巨大鼓舞。边防战士们怀着激动的心情，把全会公报端端正正地抄在笔记本上，带着公报巡逻放哨，浑身增添了无穷的力量。
    十一月一日晚，黑龙江省某四好边防站的战士们，收听完广播，马上举行向伟大统帅毛主席敬献忠心的大会。接着，又带着刚记录下来的公报全文，连夜来到附近生产大队民兵连，把这个喜讯传给贫下中农和民兵。军民一起热烈欢呼公报的发表，一起制定落实公报的措施，决心进一步掀起活学活用毛泽东思想的新高潮，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想建起一道反修防修的钢铁长城。一支支军民巡逻队出发了。他们迎着寒风，细心进行巡逻，随时准备歼灭敢于来犯的敌人。
    内蒙古某边防分队战士，收听了公报，回顾两年多来无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，心潮滚滚，热血沸腾。指战员们手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，列队站在毛主席像前发出钢铁誓言：一定要认真学习公报，热情宣传公报，坚决执行公报，英勇捍卫公报；一定要百倍提高革命警惕，保卫边疆，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，保卫祖国社会主义江山千秋万代永不变色。当夜，边防战士又一个牧业点一个牧业点地向牧民群众传播喜讯，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装群众，在反修前哨进一步筑起毛泽东思想的铜墙铁壁。
    雪山战士永远忠于毛主席！
    喜讯传到祖国西南边疆的风雪丫口，驻宿在这里的边防部队某部八连指战员，集合在毛主席像前，隆重举行庆祝活动。“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”的欢呼声，震荡雪山峡谷。
    指战员们来到过去英帝国主义侵略中国时在丫口留下来的铁丝网、碉堡和日本帝国主义残杀中国人民留下来的炮弹皮的罪证前，反复学习公报，愤怒声讨叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇。三班长和演良拿着炮弹皮，指着铁丝网，愤怒地说：“刘少奇这个大坏蛋，贩卖‘阶级斗争熄灭论’，妄想使我们失去阶级警惕性，达到他篡党、篡政、篡军的罪恶目的。刘少奇是罪恶累累的帝、修、反的走狗，打倒刘少奇！”
    为表达坚决响应公报提出的“我们必须不断加强伟大的中国人民解放军，进一步巩固国防”的伟大号召，指战员们在风雪丫口上用石头镶了“心向毛主席，扎根雪山顶”几个十几米高的大字。大家面向毛主席像庄严宣誓：敬爱的毛主席，雪山战士永远忠于您！我们一定牢记您的“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，百倍提高警惕，紧握手中枪，为保卫祖国边疆，在风雪丫口站好岗，放好哨。敌人如果胆敢来犯，我们就坚决、彻底、干净、全部地把他们消灭掉！（据新华社）
