Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Take the Stage: School Appearance Transformed

In Ningyang County, Shandong Province, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Houheshan have directly taken control of the local education, forming a part-time teaching team composed of active learners of Mao Zedong Thought and old poor peasants with deep grievances. This has led to significant changes in the appearance of both students and teachers.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, November 11th: Since March of this year, the Houheshan Primary School in Ningyang County, Shandong Province, has been managed by the local poor and lower-middle peasants. However, because the poor and lower-middle peasants did not directly control the teaching, the original teachers still dominated the lectern, and the teaching content and methods remained the same. Shortly after the school reopened, the teachers lectured on stage, while the students sang "It's Right to Rebel" below; the poor and lower-middle peasants were even more frustrated, saying: "If the teachers continue to teach students according to the methods of the counter-revolutionary revisionist Liu Shaoqi, I will immediately take my child back home!"

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants strongly demanded that the school fully implement Chairman Mao's instruction: "Students should also learn in this way, with learning as the main focus, while also learning other subjects, that is, not only learning literature but also learning industry, agriculture, and military affairs, and also criticizing the bourgeoisie." However, relying solely on the original few teachers could not solve this problem.

The poor and lower-middle peasants felt that to thoroughly change the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating the school, it was necessary to firmly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line. Merely participating in the general administrative management of the school was not enough; they must directly control the teaching authority. The brigade revolutionary committee firmly supported the revolutionary demands of the poor and lower-middle peasants. In late April, they invited an old poor peasant, the first party branch secretary of Houheshan Brigade, to take the stage at the school and deliver a vivid and moving class struggle lesson. This lesson was well-received and enthusiastically welcomed by the revolutionary teachers and students. Subsequently, through the recommendation of the poor and lower-middle peasants and the approval of the brigade revolutionary committee, a part-time teaching team of 42 poor and lower-middle peasants was established. Active learners of Mao Zedong Thought took the stage to teach the active learning of Mao Zedong Thought, old poor peasants from the old society taught class struggle, militia cadres taught military lessons, poor peasants who loved the collective and had rich production experience taught agricultural lessons, pump operators, carpenters, and bricklayers taught industrial lessons, and accountants taught abacus lessons. These part-time poor peasant teachers have given over 300 lessons in the past half year.

The poor and lower-middle peasants took the stage with high enthusiasm and a strong sense of responsibility. They often gathered to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's relevant instructions, criticizing the revisionist educational line, and continuously summarizing experiences and lessons from their work. They also organized mutual lesson observations, learning from each other's strengths and weaknesses, and jointly improving. They also prepared lessons with revolutionary teachers, continuously researching teaching content, and improving teaching methods.

The poor and lower-middle peasants taking the stage brought about a series of changes:

(1) They broke the monopoly of intellectuals on the lectern, making the teaching content and methods completely new. The poor and lower-middle peasants took the stage, making the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought and the tempering of unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao the fundamental teaching content, vividly and concretely educating students to be unconditionally loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao. They brought class enemies into the classroom, criticizing as they lectured; when teaching industrial and agricultural lessons, they led the students to the pumps and experimental fields, lecturing as they worked. The students happily said: "The poor and lower-middle peasants' lectures are easy to understand, see, remember, and apply. The more we listen, the more we like it, and the more we learn, the more enthusiastic we become!"

(2) Through the poor and lower-middle peasants' words and deeds, the students' class feelings of unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao became deeper, and their enthusiasm for actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works became higher. Out of 304 students in the school, 44 were evaluated as brigade active learners of Chairman Mao's works. Now, most students can use Chairman Mao's instructions as weapons to criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi. Mao Zedong Thought has illuminated the children's eyes, and good people and good deeds emerge in layers. Under the direct education of the poor and lower-middle peasants, the students' practical knowledge has become richer.

(3) It promoted the thought revolution of the teachers. After the poor and lower-middle peasants entered the school and took the stage, they broke through the "national borders" of this "independent kingdom" of the school. The poor and lower-middle peasants' lectures, the teachers and students listened together. The deep proletarian feelings of the poor and lower-middle peasants educated the teachers, and the remarkable effects of the poor and lower-middle peasants' lectures made the teachers extremely admiring. They gradually realized that the poor and lower-middle peasants were indeed the main force of the rural educational revolution and indeed good teachers for them to receive re-education. Under the education of the poor and lower-middle peasants, many revolutionary teachers walked out of the school gates, fixed themselves in the production teams, taught in the morning, worked in the fields in the afternoon, and studied Mao Zedong Thought with the poor and lower-middle peasants in the evening, criticizing and transforming themselves. The poor and lower-middle peasants warmly welcomed revolutionary teachers who firmly united with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, praising them as "good teachers of the school, good members of the people's commune, good propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought, good tutors for commune members to study culture, and good students of the poor and lower-middle peasants."

　　贫下中农登上讲台学校面貌焕然一新
　　山东省宁阳县后合山贫下中农直接掌握当地的教学大权，由活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子和苦大仇深的老贫农组成兼职教师队伍，使学生和教师面貌发生很大变化
    据新华社济南十一日电　山东省宁阳县后合山小学，从今年三月开始就由当地贫下中农进行管理。但是，由于贫下中农没有直接掌握教学大权，仍然是原有的教师独霸讲台，教学内容、教学方法还是老一套，开课不久，就复旧了。结果教师在台上讲课，学生在台下大唱《造反有理》歌；贫下中农更恼火，说：“老师要再按照刘少奇这个大坏蛋的办法教学生，我就马上把孩子领回家！”
    广大贫下中农强烈要求学校全面落实毛主席“学生也是这样，以学为主，兼学别样，即不但学文，也要学工、学农、学军，也要批判资产阶级”的指示。可是，单靠原来的几个教师，解决不了这个问题。
    贫下中农感到，要彻底改变资产阶级知识分子统治学校的现象，坚决贯彻毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，光参与学校的一般行政管理是不行的，必须直接掌握教学大权。大队革委会坚决支持贫下中农的革命要求，在四月底请一位老贫农、后合山大队的第一任党支部书记登上学校讲台，讲了一堂生动感人的阶级斗争课。这一课讲得很好，受到了广大革命师生的热烈欢迎。接着，经过贫下中农推荐、大队革委会批准，建立了一支由四十二名贫下中农组成的兼职教师队伍，由活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子上台讲活学活用毛泽东思想课，由旧社会苦大仇深的贫下中农讲阶级斗争课，民兵干部教军事课，热爱集体、生产经验丰富的贫下中农讲学农课，抽水机手、木工、瓦工等教学工课，会计教珠算课。这些贫下中农兼职教师，半年来已先后到校讲了三百多堂课。
    贫下中农登台讲课，热情很高，责任心很强。他们经常凑在一起，办毛泽东思想学习班，反复学习毛主席的有关教导，批判修正主义教育路线，不断总结工作中的经验教训。平时还组织互相听课，取长补短，共同提高。还和革命的教师一道备课，不断研究教学内容，改进教学方法。
    贫下中农登上讲台引起了一系列的变化：
      （一）打破了知识分子垄断讲台的一统天下，使教学内容、教学方法焕然一新。贫下中农登上讲台，把宣传毛泽东思想，锤炼对毛主席的无限忠心，作为最根本的教学内容，生动形象地向学生进行无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的教育。他们把阶级敌人揪进课堂，边讲边批判；讲学工、学农课，把学生领到抽水机旁、试验田里，边讲边干。学生高兴地说：“贫下中农讲课，听得进，看得见，记得住，用得上，越听越爱听，越学越带劲！”
      （二）通过贫下中农言传身教，这个学校的学生无限忠于毛主席的阶级感情越来越深，活学活用毛主席著作的积极性越来越高。全校三百零四名学生，有四十四人被评为大队活学活用毛主席著作积极分子。现在，大部分学生都能以毛主席的教导为武器批判叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义谬论。毛泽东思想照亮了孩子们的眼睛，好人好事层出不穷。在贫下中农的直接教育下，学生的实际知识也越来越丰富。
      （三）促进了教师的思想革命化。贫下中农进入学校后，登上讲台，冲破了学校这个“独立王国”的“国界”。贫下中农讲课，教师和学生一块听。贫下中农深厚的无产阶级感情使教师受到教育，贫下中农讲课收到的显著效果使教师极为钦佩，他们逐步认识到贫下中农确实是农村教育革命的主力军，也确实是自己接受再教育的好教师。在贫下中农的教育下，许多革命教师走出校门，固定到生产队，上午到校讲课，下午到队劳动，晚上和贫下中农在一起活学活用毛泽东思想，斗私批修。贫下中农对坚决同工农兵结合的革命教师十分欢迎，赞誉他们是“学校的好教员，人民公社的好社员，毛泽东思想的好宣传员，社员学习文化的好辅导员，贫下中农的好学员。”
