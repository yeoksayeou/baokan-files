The communiqué of the historic and significant Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, personally presided over by our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, has been issued. The joyous news has arrived, and we raise our arms high to shout: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years of life to Chairman Mao!

The great helmsman Chairman Mao personally initiated and led this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It not only has extremely great significance for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat in our country and preventing capitalist restoration but also has extremely profound significance for the international communist movement. Chairman Mao's brilliant thesis on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat is a great development and contribution to Marxism-Leninism. The practice of the Cultural Revolution over the past two years has proven that following Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is victory!

When the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Fujian, Ye Fei, Fan Shiren, and Hou Zhenya, usurped part of the leadership, our working class suffered all kinds of persecution from them. Taking our factory as an example: before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the power over party affairs, administration, finance, and culture in the factory was seized by a handful of traitors, spies, and diehard capitalist-roaders. They vigorously promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, spreading the theory of the "extinction of class struggle" and "slavery," advocating "profits first," "material incentives," and "experts in charge of the factory." Anyone who dared to rebel against them would immediately suffer cruel persecution. Hats like "troublemaker" and "backward element" were arbitrarily slapped on people. In the caustic soda workshop, some excellent workers who loved Chairman Mao dearly had submitted many applications to join the Party. However, because they dared to fight against a handful of class enemies, they were rejected from the Party's gates time and time again, while some bad people were pulled into the Party. This is intolerable!

In August 1966, the great helmsman Chairman Mao issued the brilliant and radiant "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster at the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, pointing out the direction for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We, the working class, responded to the great call of Chairman Mao and rose up to rebel against the bourgeois headquarters. With Chairman Mao as our leader and supporter, we, together with the Red Guards, exposed the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi's agents in Fujian. This plenary session unanimously decided to expel Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever and remove all his positions within and outside the Party, which is truly a great relief. This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and it is a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

The issuance of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party marks the entry of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into a new stage. The communiqué fully reflects Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts and is our great program for struggle to further carry out the struggle of criticism, struggle, and transformation and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. We, the working class, firmly support it and will definitely carry it out. We are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and carry out a deeper and more thorough criticism of the revolution, thoroughly eliminating the poison of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionism. We will also resolutely fight the battle to clean up the class ranks, rooting out all traitors, spies, diehard capitalist-roaders, and all counter-revolutionaries to consolidate our socialist ironclad fortress.

Great leader Chairman Mao! On this joyous day, we workers, with profound proletarian feelings, swear to you: We will definitely take Comrade Lin Biao as our shining example, forever be loyal to you, forever be loyal to your brilliant thoughts, and forever be loyal to your proletarian revolutionary line!

    把大叛徒刘少奇永远开除出党大快人心！
    福建省革委会常委、福州第二化工厂工人　张益飞
    我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持的、具有伟大历史意义的党的第八届扩大的十二中全会的公报发表了。喜讯传来，我们振臂高呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！
    我们的伟大统帅毛主席亲自发动、亲自领导的这场无产阶级文化大革命，不仅对巩固我国无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟有着极其伟大的意义，而且对国际共产主义运动也有极其深远的意义。毛主席关于在无产阶级专政的条件下继续革命的天才学说，是对马克思列宁主义的伟大发展和伟大贡献。两年多来的文化大革命运动的实践证明，紧跟毛主席的无产阶级革命路线前进，就是胜利！
    当叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其在福建的代理人叶飞、范式人、侯振亚篡夺了一部分领导权的时候，我们工人阶级受尽了他们的种种迫害。以我们厂为例：在无产阶级文化大革命前，厂里的党、政、财、文大权，被一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派把持了。他们极力推行反革命修正主义路线，散布“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“奴隶主义”，鼓吹“利润挂帅”、“物质刺激”、“专家治厂”。谁敢造他们的反，就会马上遭到残酷的迫害。“调皮捣蛋”、“落后分子”的帽子就乱扣下来。烧碱车间有些优秀工人，无限热爱毛主席，曾经打了好多次报告申请入党。但是由于他们敢于同一小撮阶级敌人作斗争，一次又一次地被拒绝于党的大门外，而有些坏人则被他们拉入党内。是可忍，孰不可忍！
    一九六六年八月，伟大统帅毛主席在党的八届十一中全会上，发表了光辉灿烂的《炮打司令部》的大字报，指明了无产阶级文化大革命胜利前进的航向。我们工人阶级，响应毛主席他老人家的伟大号召，起来造资产阶级司令部的反。有毛主席作主、撑腰，我们同红卫兵小将一起，把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇在福建的代理人揪了出来。这次全会一致决定，把刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外一切职务，真是大快人心。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的一个伟大胜利，这是无产阶级文化大革命的一个伟大胜利！
    党的第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会公报的发表，标志着无产阶级文化大革命进入了一个新阶段。公报充分体现了毛主席的光辉思想，是我们进一步搞好斗、批、改，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的伟大斗争纲领。我们工人阶级坚决拥护，坚决照办。我们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，更加深入地展开革命大批判，彻底肃清刘少奇反革命修正主义的流毒；我们还要坚决打好清理阶级队伍这一仗，把一切叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派和一切反革命分子统统挖出来，巩固我们的社会主义铁打江山。
    伟大的领袖毛主席啊！在这大喜的日子里，我们工人怀着无比深厚的无产阶级感情，向您老人家宣誓：一定以林副主席为光辉榜样，永远忠于您，永远忠于您的光辉思想，永远忠于您的无产阶级革命路线！
