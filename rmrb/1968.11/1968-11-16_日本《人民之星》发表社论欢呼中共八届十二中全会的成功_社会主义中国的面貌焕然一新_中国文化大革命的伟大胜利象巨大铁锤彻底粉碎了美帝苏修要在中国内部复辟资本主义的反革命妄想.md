The Japanese "People's Star" publishes an editorial hailing the success of the Twelfth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the CCP

	Socialist China's appearance has been completely transformed
	The great victory of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, like a massive hammer, has thoroughly smashed the counter-revolutionary delusions of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism to restore capitalism within China

	New China News Agency, November 15th: Tokyo News: The organ of the National Coordinating Committee of the Japanese Communist Party (Left Wing), the "People's Star," published an editorial on the 15th, enthusiastically hailing the success of the Enlarged Twelfth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

	The editorial pointed out that the communique of this plenum summarized the great historical significance of the victories achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Comrade Mao Zedong, and pointed the way forward for the people of the world. The publication of the communique of the plenum announced new great victories for the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world, and announced new great victories for Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. The communique dealt a new heavy blow to U.S.-led imperialism, Soviet-led modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries.

	The editorial said: The great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has struck a revolutionary hammer blow at U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist traitor clique. The U.S. and the Soviet Union had pinned their hopes on the bourgeois reactionaries hidden within the great socialist country of China, hoping that these bourgeois elements could, like Khrushchev, usurp the power of the proletarian dictatorship in China, transforming it into a bourgeois dictatorship, thereby changing the color of socialist China and restoring capitalism. However, their counter-revolutionary delusions have been thoroughly smashed by the great struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

	The editorial pointed out that under the brilliant leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China not only exposed and smashed the bourgeois headquarters of the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices who attempted to usurp the power of the Chinese proletariat, making the appearance of socialist China completely transformed and the proletarian dictatorship more invincible, but also solved a series of theoretical and practical problems in the transition from socialism to communism, opening up a broad road to the ideal society of mankind, and making China a reliable and strong bastion for the people of the world in their struggle against U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and their lackeys, and in their struggle for national liberation.

	The editorial pointed out that this is a great contribution of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people led by Comrade Mao Zedong to the revolutionary struggle of the people of the world, and a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

	The editorial pointed out that the great storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has widely spread Mao Zedong Thought among the Japanese people. Under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary people of Japan have exposed the true colors of the Japanese Communist Party's Miyamoto revisionist clique, which hides behind the banner of Marxism-Leninism, and have revealed their cunning and treacherous revisionist deceptive tactics. True communists in Japan have risen up to oppose the Miyamoto revisionist clique, making the Japanese revolution present a completely new appearance.

	The editorial said that the great storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Comrade Mao Zedong has powerfully promoted the Japanese revolutionary people to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Japanese people have found the true path to break the chains of oppression and rule by U.S. imperialism and the treacherous monopoly capitalists of Japan.

	The editorial went on to say that once the great truth of Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses, it produces an increasingly powerful material force.

	The editorial said that the great process of victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has made the broad revolutionary masses increasingly clearly recognize that Comrade Mao Zedong is the Lenin of our time, that Mao Zedong Thought is Marxism-Leninism in the era when imperialism is heading towards total collapse and socialism towards world victory, and that it is the guiding ideology that guarantees the victory of the Japanese revolution.

	The editorial said that the great process of victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has made the broad masses increasingly clearly recognize that the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people led by Comrade Mao Zedong are forever the most reliable backing for the Japanese people in their struggle to overthrow U.S. imperialism, the treacherous monopoly capitalists of Japan, and their accomplices, Soviet revisionism, and the Miyamoto revisionist clique, and to win the victory of the Japanese revolution.

	The editorial quoted Chairman Mao's inscription to Japanese worker friends: "As long as we seriously achieve the combination of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Japanese revolution, the victory of the Japanese revolution is beyond doubt." The editorial said that this inscription points out the direction of the current struggle of the revolutionary people of Japan. The revolutionary people of Japan are deeply studying the profound significance of this important inscription.

	The editorial condemned the U.S., Soviet revisionism, the Sato reactionary government, and the Miyamoto revisionist clique for their shameless slanders against the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. The editorial said that the facts clearly show that they are all accomplices of the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi. As the communique of the Enlarged Twelfth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out: "The number one capitalist-roader in the Party, Liu Shaoqi, is a traitor, spy, and scab buried within the Party, and a lackey of the imperialists, modern revisionists, and the Nationalist reactionaries, who is riddled with crimes."

	The editorial said that in the current situation where the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has achieved great victories, while exposing the conspiracy of the U.S. and the Soviet Union to re-divide the world, the communique of the Enlarged Twelfth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a powerful call: "All peoples oppressed by U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and their lackeys should form a broad united front to thoroughly smash the conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism to dominate the world, so as to achieve their own victories and liberation more quickly." The editorial went on to point out: Let us combine this battle call with the line of the Japanese revolution and march forward bravely!

　　日本《人民之星》发表社论欢呼中共八届十二中全会的成功
　　社会主义中国的面貌焕然一新
    中国文化大革命的伟大胜利象巨大铁锤彻底粉碎了美帝苏修要在中国内部复辟资本主义的反革命妄想
    新华社十五日讯　东京消息：日本共产党（左派）全国协议会机关报《人民之星》十五日发表社论，热烈欢呼中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会的成功。
    社论指出，这次全会公报对于伟大领袖毛泽东同志亲自发动和亲自领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命所取得的具有伟大历史意义的胜利，进行了总结，并且给全世界人民指出了前进的方向。全会公报的发表宣告了中国人民和全世界革命人民取得了新的伟大胜利，宣告了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的新的伟大胜利。全会公报给予以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏修为首的现代修正主义和各国反动派以新的沉重的打击。
    社论说：无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，把革命的巨大的铁锤打在美帝国主义和苏联修正主义叛徒集团身上。美帝、苏修曾经把希望寄托在埋藏在伟大的社会主义中国内部的资产阶级反动分子身上，它们希望这些资产阶级分子也能象赫鲁晓夫那样篡夺中国的无产阶级专政的政权，把它变为资产阶级专政，从而使社会主义中国改变颜色，复辟资本主义。但是，它们的这种反革命妄想，已被中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大斗争彻底粉碎了。
    社论指出，在毛泽东同志的天才领导下，中国的无产阶级文化大革命，不仅把妄图篡夺中国无产阶级政权的叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其同伙揪了出来，并粉碎了他们的资产阶级司令部，使社会主义中国的面貌焕然一新，无产阶级专政变得更加坚不可摧，而且解决了由社会主义向共产主义过渡的一系列理论和实践问题，开辟了走向人类理想社会的广阔道路，并使中国成为世界人民反对美帝、苏修及其走狗的压迫、争取民族解放的斗争的最可靠的坚强堡垒。
    社论指出，这是毛泽东同志和毛泽东同志领导下的中国共产党和中国人民对世界人民革命斗争的伟大贡献，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    社论指出，无产阶级文化大革命的伟大风暴使伟大的毛泽东思想在日本人民中广泛地传播。在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，日本革命人民剥开了打着马克思列宁主义幌子的日共宫本修正主义集团的画皮，使它们狡猾、阴险的修正主义欺骗手段现了原形。日本真正的共产主义者纷纷起来造了宫本修正主义集团的反，使日本革命出现了完全崭新的面貌。
    社论说，毛泽东同志亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命的风暴，有力地推动了日本革命人民活学活用毛泽东思想。日本人民在毛泽东思想指引下，找到了斩断美帝国主义和卖国垄断资产阶级压迫和统治日本人民的锁链的真正途径。
    社论接着说，毛泽东思想的伟大真理，一旦被亿万革命人民群众所掌握，就产生了越来越强大的物质力量。
    社论说，中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利过程，使广大革命人民越来越清楚地认识到，毛泽东同志是当代的列宁，毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义，是保证日本革命胜利的指导思想。
    社论说，无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利过程，使广大人民越来越清楚地认识到伟大领袖毛泽东同志领导的中国共产党和中国人民，永远是日本人民在打倒美帝国主义、日本卖国垄断资产阶级及其帮凶苏联修正主义和宫本修正主义集团，争取日本革命胜利的斗争中的最可靠的后盾。
    社论引用了毛主席书赠日本工人朋友们的伟大题词：“只要认真做到：马克思、列宁主义的普遍真理与日本革命的具体实践相结合，日本革命的胜利就是毫无疑义的。”社论说，这一题词指出了当前日本革命人民的斗争方向。日本革命人民正在深入学习这一重要题词的深刻意义。
    社论谴责美帝、苏修、佐藤反动政府和宫本修正主义集团对中国无产阶级文化大革命进行无耻的诬蔑。社论说，事实清楚地表明，它们都是叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的同伙。正如中国共产党第八届扩大的十二中全会公报所指出的：中国“党内头号走资本主义道路当权派刘少奇，是一个埋藏在党内的叛徒、内奸、工贼，是罪恶累累的帝国主义、现代修正主义和国民党反动派的走狗。”
    社论说，在当前中国无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大胜利的形势下，中国共产党第八届扩大的十二中全会公报在揭露美苏妄图重新瓜分世界的阴谋的同时，发出了强有力的号召：“一切被美帝国主义、苏联修正主义和他们的走狗所压迫的人民，应当结成一个广泛的统一战线，彻底粉碎美帝、苏修妄图霸占世界的阴谋，以便更迅速地取得自己的胜利和解放。”社论接着指出，让我们把这个战斗号召与日本革命的路线紧紧地结合起来，奋勇前进！
