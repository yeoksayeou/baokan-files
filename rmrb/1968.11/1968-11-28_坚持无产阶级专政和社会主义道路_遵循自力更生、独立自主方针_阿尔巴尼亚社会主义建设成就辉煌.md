The heroic Albanian working class and the broad masses of laboring people, under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Albanian Party of Labor, have persisted in proletarian dictatorship and the socialist path, achieving brilliant results in the construction of modern socialist industry.

Before liberation, impoverished and backward Albania had no modern industry. The few mining areas that existed were exploited by foreign capital, plundering Albania's underground resources and exploiting the blood and sweat of Albanian workers. After liberation, Albania implemented industrial nationalization, relying on its own resources, tapping into internal potential, and developing modern industry. Now, new factories and mines can be seen everywhere in Albania. The total industrial output value for 1968 is expected to be 51 times that of 1938, the year before the war.

In recent years, especially since Albania implemented the fourth five-year plan for economic and cultural development (1966-1970), Albanian socialist industry has developed even more rapidly. The fourth five-year plan stipulates an average annual growth of 8.7% in total industrial output value, but the results of the first three years show an average annual growth of 14%. The three-year industrial output value plan has been completed by 106%. During this period, Albania has established new industrial sectors such as fertilizers, steel rolling, and copper refining. With the development of socialist industry, the ranks of the Albanian working class and technical cadres are continually expanding.

The development of Albanian industry, especially its rapid development in recent years, is the result of the Albanian people, under the leadership of Comrade Hoxha and the Party of Labor, persisting in proletarian dictatorship and the socialist path, and implementing correct policies.

The Albanian Party, government, and people have smashed the evil deeds of the Soviet modern revisionist traitor clique, which attempted to obstruct socialist Albania from achieving genuine industrialization and to impose an economic blockade on socialist Albania. They adhere to the policy of relying primarily on their own strength, relying on domestic wealth and resources, and independently developing socialist industry. At the same time, the Albanian Party of Labor, before and after the Fifth Congress, has taken a series of measures in industrial and mining enterprises aimed at promoting the revolutionization of national life and people's thinking. They have launched a revolutionization movement, opposed bureaucratism, streamlined administrative organs, reduced high salaries, strengthened the supervision of the working class, strengthened party building, recruited new party members from among the workers, promoted worker cadres, advocated that cadres participate in physical labor, strengthened political and ideological education for employees, and advocated putting spiritual encouragement above material rewards, among other things.

Through the revolutionization movement, the broad masses of workers have greatly enhanced their socialist consciousness, and many heroic collectives and individuals have emerged. For example, the miners of the third section of the Mborje-Drenova coal mine in the Korça region once encountered a flood of underground water while excavating a tunnel. Some workers jumped into the water to block the underground water and rescue the workers in the mine, while the workers mining coal in the mine did not stop working for a moment. Many Party members and young workers in the Krabë coal mine in Tirana region do not fear difficulties or calculate rewards and voluntarily go to work in new mines and backward production teams. The miners of the Manz coal mine in the Durrës region do not fear sacrifice and jump into the fire to extinguish a forest fire. In addition, heroes such as Adam Reka, a harbor worker and Party member who sacrificed his life to save socialist property, and Qazim Hasimaj, a miner, as well as Muharrem Shehu, an oil engineer, and Murtaz Kepi, a technician, who sacrificed their lives for technological innovation, are praised everywhere and serve as examples for everyone to learn from.

The revolutionization movement has promoted the revolutionization of people's thinking and mobilized the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers for production. A fervent socialist production competition is continuing. Many workers in industrial and mining enterprises propose to "race against time." They continuously improve the utilization rate of machinery and equipment, reasonably arrange labor time and organization, increase labor productivity, and increase production for the state. The geological exploration companies in Pogradec, Gjirokastër, and Burrel have already completed the entire fourth five-year plan for exploring coal and chromium mines. The initiator of increasing labor productivity, the Tirana Stalin Textile Combine, has already had 1,400 workers reach or exceed the labor productivity planned for the last year of the fourth five-year plan—1970. All the workers in the Tirana Brick and Tile Factory have reached the labor productivity planned for 1970.

The broad masses of workers, in accordance with the Party's instructions on "self-reliance," "cooperation and technological revolution," tap into internal potential, promote cooperation between industrial and mining enterprises, unify and rationally use machinery and equipment, exchange production experience, carry out technological innovation and rationalization proposals, save raw materials, reduce costs, increase new products, and improve product quality. In recent years, Albanian geological explorers have found oil in limestone layers that were previously considered oil-free by revisionist experts and have begun production. The Krabë coal mine area in the Tirana region, which was previously considered exhausted by foreign experts, has found new coal mines nearby through the efforts of Albanian geologists. Workers in various Albanian industrial and mining enterprises also cooperate with each other, designing and building some mines and large-scale hydroelectric power stations, refineries, and other projects themselves.

Now, the heroic Albanian working class, together with the entire people, is further deepening the movement to revolutionize national life and people's thinking under Comrade Hoxha's instructions this year on "working-class supervision" and "further revolutionizing schools," and is striving with revolutionary vigor to complete and overfulfill the fourth five-year plan formulated by the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labor.

Albanian people have achieved brilliant results in building socialism through self-reliance, transforming Albania from a backward agricultural country into an advanced socialist country with modern industry and collective agriculture. The picture shows a new large-scale hydroelectric power station, the Vau i Dejës Hydroelectric Power Station, under construction.

    坚持无产阶级专政和社会主义道路　遵循自力更生、独立自主方针
    阿尔巴尼亚社会主义建设成就辉煌
    新华社地拉那二十七日电　英雄的阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级和广大劳动人民，在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，坚持无产阶级专政和社会主义道路，在建设社会主义的现代化工业中取得了辉煌的成就。
    解放以前贫穷落后的阿尔巴尼亚没有现代化的工业，仅有的几处用手工业方式开采的矿区是外国资本掠夺阿尔巴尼亚地下资源和剥削阿尔巴尼亚工人血汗的场所。解放以后，阿尔巴尼亚实现了工业国有化，依靠本国资源，发掘内部潜力，发展了现代化的工业。现在在阿尔巴尼亚到处可以看到新建的厂矿。一九六八年全国工业总产值预计将比战前的一九三八年增长五十一倍。
    近年来，特别是阿尔巴尼亚执行发展经济和文化的第四个五年计划（一九六六——一九七○年）以来，阿尔巴尼亚的社会主义工业更加迅速发展。第四个五年计划规定工业生产总值平均每年增长百分之八点七，而头三年执行的结果是，平均每年增长百分之十四。头三年工业总产值计划已完成百分之一百零六。在此期间，阿尔巴尼亚还建立了化肥、轧钢和铜的精炼等新的工业部门。随着社会主义工业的发展，阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级和技术干部的队伍也正在不断壮大。
    阿尔巴尼亚工业的发展，特别是近年来的迅速发展，是由于阿尔巴尼亚人民在以霍查同志为首的劳动党的领导下坚持无产阶级专政和社会主义道路，执行正确政策的结果。
    阿尔巴尼亚党、政府和人民，粉碎了苏联现代修正主义叛徒集团企图阻碍社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚实现真正的工业化、对社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚进行经济封锁等罪恶行径，坚持首先依靠自己的力量，依靠国内的财富和资源，独立自主地发展社会主义工业的方针。同时，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党在第五次代表大会前后，在工矿企业中采取了一系列旨在促进国家生活和人的思想革命化的措施，开展了革命化运动，反对官僚主义，精简行政机构，降低高工资，加强工人阶级的监督，加强党的建设，从工人中吸收新党员，提拔工人干部，提倡干部参加体力劳动，对职工加强政治思想教育，提倡把精神鼓舞放在物质奖励之上等等。
    广大职工通过革命化运动，大大提高了社会主义觉悟，涌现出许多英雄集体和个人。例如，科尔察区姆博雷—德雷诺瓦煤矿第三工区的矿工有一次在掘进坑道时遇到了泛滥成河的地下水，一部分工人奋身跳入水中，堵塞了地下水，抢救正在矿井里的工人，而在矿井里采煤的工人却一刻也没有停止工作。地拉那区克拉巴煤矿的许多劳动党党员和青年工人不怕困难，不计报酬，自愿到新矿和后进的生产队去工作。都拉斯区的曼兹煤矿的矿工不怕牺牲，纵身跳入火海，去扑灭森林中的大火。此外，象为抢救社会主义财富而英勇牺牲的海港工人、劳动党党员亚当·雷卡和矿工恰齐姆·哈西马伊，为技术革新忘我劳动而因公牺牲的石油工程师穆哈梅特·希胡和技术员穆尔特扎·凯皮等英雄形象更是到处传颂，成为人人争学的榜样。
    革命化运动促进了人的思想革命化，调动了广大职工的生产积极性。一个热火朝天的社会主义生产竞赛正在持续地展开。许多工矿企业的职工提出要“同时间赛跑”。他们不断提高机器设备的利用率，合理安排劳动时间和劳动组织，提高劳动生产率，为国家增加生产。波格拉德茨、吉诺卡斯特、布尔奇泽等地质勘探公司的职工已经完成了整个第四个五年计划的勘探煤矿和铬矿的任务。提高劳动生产率的倡议者地拉那斯大林纺织联合工厂已经有一千四百名工人达到或超过了第四个五年计划最后一年——一九七○年计划规定的劳动生产率。地拉那砖瓦厂全厂职工都已达到一九七○年计划规定的劳动生产率。
    广大职工遵照劳动党关于“自力更生”、“协作和科技革命”的指示，发掘内部潜力，开展工矿企业之间的协作，统一和合理使用机器设备，交流生产经验，开展技术革新和合理化建议运动，节约原材料，降低成本，增加新产品，提高产品质量。近年来，阿尔巴尼亚地质勘探工作者在过去被修正主义专家认为没有石油的石灰层里面找到了石油，而且开始了生产。地拉那区克拉巴煤矿区过去被外国专家认为是已经开采尽了的地区，经过阿尔巴尼亚地质工作者的努力，在这个地区附近又找到了新的煤矿。阿尔巴尼亚各工矿企业的职工还互相协作，自己设计和建设了一些矿井和大型水电站、炼油厂等工程。
    现在，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级同全体人民一道，在霍查同志今年关于“工人阶级监督”和关于“学校进一步革命化”的指示下，正在更加深入开展国家生活和人的思想革命化运动，并以在这一运动中焕发出来的革命干劲，为完成和提前完成阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会所制订的第四个五年计划而奋斗。
