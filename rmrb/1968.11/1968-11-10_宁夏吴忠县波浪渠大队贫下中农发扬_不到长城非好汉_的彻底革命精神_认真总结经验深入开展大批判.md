Since the start of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Wulangqu Brigade, Wuzhong County, Ningxia, have consistently adhered to revolutionary criticism and struggle. Inspired by the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, they have followed Chairman Mao's great teaching of "carrying the revolution through to the end." They have carried forward the spirit of "not a hero until you reach the Great Wall," seriously summed up the experience of revolutionary criticism, identified gaps, and taken measures. They have launched a more vigorous attack on Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist ideology, powerfully promoting the work of purging the class ranks and rectifying and strengthening the Party. As a result, winter production has been carried out with great enthusiasm.

Wulangqu Brigade is a Muslim brigade, with the vast majority of its members being poor and lower-middle peasants with deep hatred and bitterness.

When the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee reached Wulangqu Brigade, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants heard the decision to expel the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever and to remove all his Party and government posts. They clapped their hands in approval. Amidst the celebrations, some people had confused ideas, thinking that the biggest piece of junk, Liu Shaoqi, had been thrown into the garbage heap, his posts removed, and his Party membership revoked forever. They thought he could no longer cause any trouble, and they could breathe a sigh of relief.

In the new situation, how to guide the broad revolutionary masses to channel their great revolutionary indignation against Liu Shaoqi into an unrelenting and in-depth revolutionary criticism? The brigade revolutionary leading group analyzed and studied the active thoughts of the masses and believed that the key issue was to make the broad masses fully realize that class struggle is long-term and tortuous. The collapse of the bourgeois headquarters represented by Liu Shaoqi and their agents in various places is not the end of revolutionary criticism but a new starting point. Whether or not to continue to deepen the revolutionary criticism is a major issue of loyalty to Chairman Mao, of whether or not to carry out the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and of whether or not to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

After raising their awareness, the members of the revolutionary leading group immediately went to various production teams and, together with the masses, studied the communiqué and repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teaching: "The current cultural revolution is only the first one; there will inevitably be more in the future. The victory or defeat of the revolution will be decided over a very long historical period. If things are not handled well, capitalist restoration may occur at any time. All Party members and the people of the whole country should not think that one or two, three or four cultural revolutions will ensure lasting peace. Be extremely vigilant and never relax."

Following this, they mobilized the masses to thoroughly review the achievements made in the revolutionary criticism over the past year and to investigate the new moves of the class enemies. This process of study, review, and investigation greatly raised the awareness of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. They said: As long as the class enemies exist, revolutionary criticism must be carried out every day.

On the basis of raising awareness, they also identified the problems that existed in the previous period of revolutionary criticism and, targeting these problems, proposed measures for further deepening the criticism: further establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes, combining criticism with implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, combining criticism with carrying out the "three loyalties" activities, combining criticism with purging the class ranks and rectifying and strengthening the Party; strengthening leadership and fully playing the role of the backbone of the old poor peasants with deep hatred and bitterness.

In recent days, revolutionary criticism battlefields have been set up everywhere in Wulangqu Brigade. In the Mao Zedong Thought study classes held by the brigade, everyone criticized Liu Shaoqi's revisionist party-building line; in various production teams, they fiercely fought against the class enemies and criticized Liu Shaoqi's theory of the "extinction of class struggle"; at the autumn grain distribution meeting, they criticized Liu Shaoqi's "material incentives"; on the construction site of the irrigation channels, they criticized Liu Shaoqi's "work points in command." In the evenings, every household held family criticism meetings, with people from six to seventy years old all participating. Under the powerful promotion of revolutionary criticism, winter production in Wulangqu Brigade has seen a new leap forward, with the progress of fertilizer accumulation, land plowing, winter irrigation, and canal repair far exceeding that of previous years.

    宁夏吴忠县波浪渠大队贫下中农发扬“不到长城非好汉”的彻底革命精神
    认真总结经验深入开展大批判
    本报讯　文化大革命以来，始终坚持革命大批判的宁夏吴忠县波浪渠大队贫下中农，在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的鼓舞下，遵循毛主席“将革命进行到底”的伟大教导，继续发扬“不到长城非好汉”的彻底革命精神，认真总结革命大批判的经验，找差距，提措施，对刘少奇的反革命修正主义思想，发起了更猛烈的进攻，有力地推动了清理阶级队伍、整党建党工作，使冬季生产搞得热气腾腾。
    波浪渠大队是个回民队，绝大多数是苦大仇深的贫下中农。
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报传到波浪渠大队时，广大贫下中农听到把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外一切职务的英明决定，人人拍手称快。在欢庆声中，少数人也产生了一些糊涂思想，认为刘少奇这块最大的废料，已被扔进了垃圾堆，官也罢了，职也撤了，党籍也永远开除了，再也成不了什么气候，可以松口气了。
    在新的形势下，怎样才能把广大革命群众对刘少奇的极大的革命义愤引导到不停顿地、持久深入地展开革命大批判上去，大队革命领导小组分析研究了群众中的活思想，认为关键的问题是要使广大群众充分认识到阶级斗争是长期的、曲折的。以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级司令部及其在各地代理人的垮台，决不是革命大批判的终结，而是革命大批判的新的起点。是不是继续深入展开革命大批判，是忠不忠于毛主席的大问题，是执行不执行以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令的大问题，是要不要将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的大问题。
    革命领导小组成员思想提高后，立即深入到各个生产队，和群众一起学习公报，并反复学习了毛主席的伟大教导：“现在的文化大革命，仅仅是第一次，以后还必然要进行多次。革命的谁胜谁负，要在一个很长的历史时期内才能解决。如果弄得不好，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的。全体党员，全国人民，不要以为有一二次、三四次文化大革命，就可以太平无事了。千万注意，决不可丧失警惕。”接着，又发动群众大摆一年多来开展革命大批判取得的成绩，大查阶级敌人的新动向。这一学一摆一查，大大提高了广大贫下中农的认识。他们说：只要阶级敌人存在一天，就要开展一天革命大批判。
    在提高认识的基础上，他们还找出了前一时期革命大批判中存在的问题，并针对这些问题，提出了进一步开展大批判的措施：进一步大办毛泽东思想学习班，把大批判和落实毛主席最新指示结合起来，把大批判和开展“三忠于”活动结合起来，把大批判和清理阶级队伍、整党建党工作结合起来；加强领导，充分发挥苦大仇深的老贫农的骨干作用。
    这几天来，在波浪渠大队，处处摆下了革命大批判的战场。在大队举办的毛泽东思想学习班里，大家大批刘少奇的修正主义建党路线；在各个生产队，他们狠斗阶级敌人，批判刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”；在秋粮分配会上，他们大批刘少奇的“物质刺激”；在整修渠道的工地上，他们大批刘少奇的“工分挂帅”。夜晚，家家户户举行家庭批判会，六、七十岁的老人和刚刚懂事的娃娃，一齐上阵。在革命大批判的有力推动下，波浪渠大队冬季生产出现了新的跃进，积肥、翻地、冬灌、修渠的进度大大超过往年。
