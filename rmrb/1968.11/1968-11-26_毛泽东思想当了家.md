Edition: 4

My name is Chen Wuhu. I am a member of Kongchi Brigade in Taitou Commune, Yangcheng County. My family consists of seven people. My eldest son is a soldier in the People's Liberation Army. Besides my wife and me, there are two daughters and two sons. My eldest daughter, Chen Huaru, is a militia member. Since the great leader Chairman Mao issued the call to establish study classes, one day my eldest daughter and my third child, Xiaozhu, said to me, "Chairman Mao has called on us to establish study classes. Let's set up a family study class!"

I am a selfish person. As soon as I heard this, I quickly said, "Yes! Let's set up a family study class. We can study a bit when we have time and work more when we have the chance." Before I finished speaking, my second child, Liuzhu, interrupted me, saying, "Father is wrong. Setting up a family study class is to better study Mao Zedong Thought. We can't just do it for the sake of it." Huaru and Xiaozhu also chimed in, saying, "Father is putting personal interests first and setting up the study class with selfish motives. It will never be successful."

I never expected the children to be so aware. They criticized me so much that my face turned red. At this point, the children proposed to elect a leader. When I heard that they wanted to elect a leader, I thought: In terms of age, I am the oldest in the family; in terms of generation, I am the father. How could the leader be anyone but me? So I said, "Whether to elect or not, as the head of the family, I should be the leader." However, my eldest daughter, Huaru, said, "That won't do. The leader must meet certain conditions. Whoever speaks and acts in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought should be the leader." After a discussion, the children all agreed that my third child, Xiaozhu, studies Chairman Mao's works well and has made progress in his thinking, so he was elected as the leader. My eldest daughter, Huaru, who is a militia member and also a propagandist for Mao Zedong Thought in the brigade, was elected as the instructor.

After our family study class was established, we started by reading the "Five Articles." Later, my eldest daughter, Huaru, returned from the militia camp study class and said, "The militia members are all engaged in self-criticism and criticizing revisionism. Our family study class should also focus on the 'use' of Mao Zedong Thought and not just learn without applying it." She also led the whole family to study Chairman Mao's teachings: "Regarding Marxist theory, one must be able to master it and apply it. The purpose of mastering it is entirely for application." At that time, I said, "Good, we must use what we learn. If we don't use it, it's as if we haven't learned it. Let's discuss how to use it!"

As soon as I finished speaking, Xiaozhu said, "My sister said that the militia members are all engaged in self-criticism and criticizing revisionism. We should also do the same in our family. Father has a lot of selfish thoughts, so let's start with Father's self-criticism." Xiaozhu is thirteen years old and a fifth-grade student. I didn't take him seriously and said, "What do you know, kid? What selfish thoughts do I have?" My eldest daughter, Huaru, continued, "We discussed in the militia that everyone should engage in self-criticism and criticize revisionism. If there are selfish thoughts, they must be criticized. Since Father has selfish thoughts, why not criticize them?" She added, "You said you have no selfish thoughts to criticize, so let me give you some advice. Last autumn, the brigade cadres returned from Dazhai and promoted the system of public labor and self-reported work points. You said that implementing this system would not allow us to earn more money from sideline work, so we won't make ropes for the brigade next year. Isn't this just thinking for yourself? Isn't this selfishness?"

After hearing her advice, I said, "Father did say that, but that was last autumn. Self-criticism and criticizing revisionism aren't about settling old scores!" At this point, Xiaozhu also gave me some advice, saying, "If we don't settle old scores, let's talk about new ones. The other day, the brigade held a meeting to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, but you didn't let me attend. You kept me at home to spin ropes. You even said that if I spun ropes well at home, you would give me 10 fen to buy rock sugar. Isn't this selling Liu Shaoqi's black goods of material incentives?" My second child, Liuzhu, who is sixteen years old and in the sixth grade, usually doesn't talk much, but at this time he also chimed in, saying, "You just talk about listening to Chairman Mao's words, but if you have selfish thoughts and don't criticize them, you are a revolutionary in words only." The children kept pointing out my mistakes, and I was breathless. Seeing that I was silent, my wife quickly said, "You kids don't know the difference between heaven and earth. Your father gets up at dawn and goes to bed at midnight, all for you to have food and clothes." Huaru said, "In the old society, why was Father so poor that he couldn't walk?" This question made her mother speechless for a moment. Huaru then asked her mother, "Mom, last year my brother wrote in a letter that the army was holding a remembrance of bitterness and sweetness session. He didn't know about the hardships our family endured in the past. You told me to write to him about the pants you wore in the old society. Can you tell us about that again?"

Huaru's question touched my sore spot, reminding me of the bitter old society. Before her mother could speak, I started talking, "In the evil old society, we poor people suffered endless exploitation and oppression from the landlords. We had nothing to eat and nothing to wear. Mother wore a pair of pants for over ten years, mending and patching it until the original shape was gone. I started working for the landlord at the age of thirteen, herding cows and working as a farmhand. From morning to night, I did the work of oxen and dogs, ate the food of pigs and dogs, and still had to endure beatings and scoldings. Once, I went to Qinshui County to work for half a month, and Mother had nothing to cook at home. She couldn't borrow even half a jin of grain from her neighbors, so she had to go to the landlord's house to borrow grain. She borrowed half a jin of chaff from them and had to work for them for ten days. Mother walked out of the landlord's door with tears dripping from her clothes, thinking that the strength of the poor was truly worthless. Later, the Japanese invaders came, driving the people to flee east and west, making life even harder and endangering our lives. Once, the Japanese invaders raided the village, and I fled to the southern mountains with my elder brother and sister-in-law. My sister-in-law was carrying an eight-month-old baby and couldn't keep up. The despicable Japanese invaders stabbed my sister-in-law to death with their bayonets and took the eight-month-old baby, who was your brother, away on their bayonets..."

At this point, I couldn't say any more, tears streaming down my face. My wife and children were all crying. After a while, I said to them, "Since the Communist Party led by Chairman Mao came to power, we poor people have been liberated and have land and houses. We have established people's communes and are living a happy life. Truly, parents' love is not as great as Chairman Mao's love, and the party's kindness is greater than heaven and earth."

At this point, my eldest daughter asked me, "Father, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao are our saviors. Shouldn't we listen to Chairman Mao's words?" I said, "Of course, we should listen. Whatever Chairman Mao tells us to do, we will do." My eldest daughter said, "Then, since Chairman Mao calls on us to engage in self-criticism and criticize revisionism, why do you say that our family has no selfish thoughts to criticize and no revisionism to criticize? Is that right?" My daughter's question left me speechless. I thought about it and felt that I was wrong. I said, "Father was wrong before! After liberation, our family's life has been getting better and better. Who would have thought that I always wanted to build a few more rooms and make our family's foundation stronger, thinking less about collective matters. Father has been fooled by Liu Shaoqi, poisoned by his ideas. All mistakes, the biggest mistake is not studying Chairman Mao's books and listening to Chairman Mao's words."

Through establishing the study class and engaging in self-criticism and criticizing revisionism, we solved many problems and promoted the ideological transformation of the whole family. Even my four-year-old youngest daughter joins us every day to wish Chairman Mao long life and can recite more than twenty quotations from Chairman Mao.

Loyalty to Chairman Mao cannot just be in words; it must be in our thoughts and actions every day, in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao teaches us, "When we make plans, do things, and think about problems, we must start from the fact that our country has six hundred million people. We must never forget this point." I am a poor peasant. In the past, when I did things and thought about problems, I thought more for myself and less for the collective and everyone. In recent years, as a military family, the brigade gives me 130 work points and relief funds every year. After establishing the study class, I thought that the children going to the army is to fulfill their duty to the country, and everyone taking care of military families is to respond to Chairman Mao's call. However, our family of six, except for the four-year-old youngest daughter, can all work. A year's income can support the whole family's life. If we receive additional work points and relief funds, it would be redundant. We should contribute this strength to the development of socialist collective production. I mentioned this idea in our family study class and asked everyone to discuss it. Everyone said that Chairman Mao led us to liberation and a happy life. We must not forget that there are still class brothers who have not been liberated in the world! The whole family unanimously decided to give up all 130 work points given by the brigade. Our family did this and was praised and encouraged by the brigade revolutionary committee.

Since our family established the study class, everything has changed. Now, our family is guided by the spirit of "public interest." This summer, our brigade built more than ten animal sheds. Halfway through the construction, it rained continuously, and the walls that were already built were about to be damaged by the rain. Huaru returned home and took the mat from my bed to cover the walls. During the summer harvest, suddenly there was thunder and rain. Huaru and Liuzhu dropped their spinning wheels and rushed to the threshing floor with everyone else to collect the wheat in the rain. In the past, my wife always thought that after suffering in bitterness, we should now let the children support themselves. This year, after learning Mao Zedong Thought, she also actively participated in collective production labor. Our courtyard has a total of six households. I and my eldest daughter, Huaru, also mobilized the militia and poor and lower-middle peasants in the courtyard to study Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, criticize Liu Shaoqi's theory of "extinguishing class struggle," sharpen our eyes, and expose a hidden class enemy.

Recently, my wife heard that I was going out to share my experiences and said, "You shouldn't boast about yourself first and like to praise yourself, fearing that others don't know!" I said, "Our family's progress is the result of Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts. This is not about boasting about ourselves; it is about promoting the great power of Mao Zedong Thought!"

    毛泽东思想当了家
    山西阳城县台头公社孔池大队贫农社员　陈五虎　口述
    我叫陈五虎，是阳城县台头公社孔池大队社员。我全家七口人，大儿子当了解放军，家里除我和老伴外，还有两个女孩、两个男孩，大女儿陈花肉是个基干民兵。自从伟大领袖毛主席向全国人民发出办学习班的伟大号召后，一天大女儿和我的三孩子小柱对我说：“毛主席号召我们办学习班，咱们家里也办个学习班吧！”我这个人私心重，一听，就急忙说：“对！咱办起家庭学习班，搭空儿学一学，抽出时间来多干点活吧！”没等我说完，二孩子刘柱就冲着我说：“爸爸说的不对，办家庭学习班，是为了更好地学习毛泽东思想，可不能挂名儿。”花肉和小柱也抢着说：“爸爸私字当头，抱上私心办学习班，永办不好。”我真没想到孩子们觉悟这么高，批评得我脸上直发烧。这时，孩子们又提出要选个组长。我一听要选组长，心想：说年龄，全家人就数我大；论辈数，我又是爸爸，这组长还能离了我！就说：“选不选吧，我当家长还能不当组长。”可是，大女儿花肉却说：“那可不行，当组长还得有个条件。谁说话办事符合毛泽东思想，就选谁当组长。”几个孩子一讨论，都说我三孩子小柱学习毛主席著作好，思想进步，就选他当了组长。大女儿花肉，是基干民兵，又是大队毛泽东思想宣传员，被选成了辅导员。
    我家学习班办起以后，开始只是念“老五篇”，后来大女儿花肉从民兵营学习班回来说：“民兵们都开展斗私批修了，咱们家的学习班也要在‘用’字上狠下功夫，不能光学不用。”她还领着全家学习了毛主席的教导：“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”当时我说：“好，学了就要用，不用等于没学，咱们讨论讨论怎么用！”我的话音刚落，三孩子小柱说：“我姐姐不是说民兵都开展斗私批修了吗，咱家里也要斗私批修，爸爸的私心重，就让爸爸先斗斗私吧！”小柱今年十三岁，是小学五年级学生，我就没把他看在眼里，就说：“你小娃家懂得甚？我有什么私好斗？”大女儿花肉接着说：“我们民兵讨论说，人人都要斗私批修，有私就得斗，爸爸既然有私，为什么不斗？”她又接着说：“你说没私可斗，我就先给你提个意见。去年秋天，大队干部从大寨参观回来，推广大寨人一心为公劳动，自报公议工分的制度，你说实行了这个制度，搞副业就不能多挣钱，咱明年就不给队里打绳了。你这不是光为自己打算，不是‘私’字是什么？”听了她提的这么个意见，我就说：“爸爸是说过这话，可这是去年秋天的话了，斗私批修，也不是叫你跟我算老账呀！”说到这里，我小柱也给我提开意见了，他说：“不算老账就说新的吧。前些天大队开会贯彻毛主席的最新指示，你不让我去参加，硬把我关在家里纺绳。你还说好好在家里纺绳，给我一角钱叫买冰糖。你这不是贩卖刘少奇‘物质刺激’的黑货？”我的二孩子刘柱，今年十六岁，念六年级了，平时不多说话，这时也插上嘴说：“光说听毛主席的话，有私不斗是口头革命派。”孩子们这个提一条，那个说几句，闹得我喘不上气。他妈看见我闷着不说话，怕我生气，就赶紧说：“你们小娃家不知道天高地厚，你爸爸起五更睡半夜，不都是为你们有吃有穿？”花肉说：“在旧社会，爸爸为什么穷得不能行？”这一问，她妈一时答不上来。花肉又问她妈：“妈，去年我哥哥来信说，部队搞忆苦思甜，他不知道咱家过去受的苦，你叫我在信上给他说过你在旧社会穿的那条裤子的事，你能不能再给我们说一说？”
    花肉这一问，捅到了我的伤心处，使我想起了吃人的旧社会。没等她妈开口，我就先说起来了：“在万恶的旧社会，咱们穷人受尽了地主的剥削和压迫，吃没吃，穿没穿，你妈一条裤穿了十几年，缝了又缝，补了又补，裤子的原样都没有了。我从十三岁就给地主放牛，当长工，一天从早到晚，做的是牛马活，吃的是猪狗食，还要挨打受骂。一次我到沁水县打短工走了半个月，你妈在家里掀开锅没米下，东邻西舍借不下三合半升，只好到地主家里去借粮，借了人家半升秕豆，要我给人家干十天活。你妈走出地主家的门，泪珠滴在衣襟上，想着穷人的力气真不值钱呀！后来，日本侵略军来了，把老百姓撵得东跑西散，生活更难过，生命也保不住。有一次日本侵略军来村扫荡，我跟你大伯、大娘往南山上跑，你大娘抱着八个月的小婴儿跑不动，掉在后头，可恨的日本侵略军就用刺刀把你大娘活活挑死了，把八个月的小孩也就是你的哥哥挑在刺刀上走了多远……。”说到这里，我再也说不下去了，眼泪一直往外流，她妈和孩子们都哭成了泪人。停了一会，我又对他们说：“自从来了毛主席领导的共产党，打倒了地主恶霸和国民党反动派，咱们穷人翻身得解放，分了土地分了房，又办起了人民公社，才过上了幸福生活。真是爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，天大地大不如党的恩情大。”
    这时，大女儿就问我：“爸爸，共产党、毛主席是咱穷人的救命恩人，咱们该不该听毛主席的话？”我说：“那当然要听呀，毛主席他老人家叫咱干啥咱就干啥。”大女儿又说：“那毛主席号召咱们斗私批修，你却说咱家没有私可斗，没有修可批，你这对吗？”女儿这么一问，可把我问住了。我思前想后，越想越觉得自己错了。我说：“爸爸以前错了！解放后，咱们家生活一天比一天过得好，谁知道我总想着多修几间房子，把家底闹厚实些，集体的事情就想得不多了。爸爸这是上了刘少奇的当，中了刘少奇的毒。千错万错，以前没有好好读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，是最大的错。”
    我们通过办学习班斗私批修，解决了很多问题，促进了全家人的思想革命化。就连我四岁的小闺女，每天都跟着我们一起敬祝毛主席万寿无疆，还能熟背二十多条毛主席语录。
    忠于毛主席不能说在嘴上，要心里想的，每天做的，都符合毛泽东思想才行。毛主席教导我们：“我们作计划、办事、想问题，都要从我国有六亿人口这一点出发，千万不要忘记这一点。”我是个贫农社员，过去办事情、想问题，为自己打算的多了，为集体、为大家想的少了。这几年当军属，队里每年优待我一百三十个工，还发给救济款。经过办学习班，我想，孩子去参军是为国家尽义务，大家优待军属是响应毛主席的号召。可是，我一家六口人除了四岁的小女儿外，都能劳动，一年的收入满顾住全家人的生活，再受优待工，再要救济款，就成了多余的了，应该把这点力量投入到发展社会主义集体生产上去。我把这个主意在我家的学习班上说了，要全家人讨论。大家都说，毛主席领导咱们翻了身，过上了幸福生活，咱可不能忘了世界上还没有翻身解放的阶级兄弟呀！全家人一致决定，大队优待的一百三十个工全都不要了。我们家这样做，受到了大队革命委员会的表扬和鼓励。
    我家自从办起学习班，就和以前大不一样。现在，我家是“公”字当家，大家时时想着集体。今年夏天，我们队里修了十几间牲口圈，修到半中间，正遇上连阴雨下个不停，上了墙的土坯眼看就要淋坏了，花肉回来，就把我床上的席子揭了去盖在墙上。夏天打麦时，突然又打雷又下雨，花肉和刘柱扔下纺车就往场上跑，跟大家一起冒雨收麦。孩子他妈过去总认为从苦水里熬到了甜水里，现在该让孩子们养活自己了，今年学了毛泽东思想，也主动参加集体生产劳动了。咱家那个院子里一共住着六户人家。我和大女儿花肉还发动院里的民兵和贫下中农，通过学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，狠批刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，擦亮眼睛，挖出了一个暗藏的阶级敌人。
    最近，我老伴听说我要到外边去讲用，就说：“你可不要先说自家好，喜欢自吹，生怕别人不知道呀！”我说：“咱家的进步，是毛主席的光辉思想教育出来的，这不是说自家好，是宣传毛泽东思想的威力大呀！”
