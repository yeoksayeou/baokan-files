In the Italian countryside, the exploitation of feudalism and the encroachment of capitalism have left the majority of peasants landless and forced them to wander abroad, living in misery.

Today, in Italy, a small group of landlords own vast amounts of farmland, while the majority of peasants have no land or very little. For example, in Sardinia, 1.8% of landlords own 43.9% of the land, while 82.8% of the people only own 56.1% of the land. Many peasants have to rent land from landlords and suffer their exploitation.

Those who suffer the most exploitation are the herdsmen. Landlords rent out their land to herdsmen, who have to hand over 35% to 70% of the gross value of their products to the landlords. This figure accounts for half of the total income from animal husbandry. The dairy products produced by herdsmen are also exploited by capitalists. Capitalists monopolize everything, and they use price reductions to plunder the herdsmen. When faced with natural disasters and poor harvests, herdsmen have to borrow money to get by. These debts cannot be repaid even with a year's income.

Capitalists and feudal landlords ruthlessly exploit the peasants, forcing them into bankruptcy, selling their land, and leaving their hometowns to work as laborers in cities or abroad. From 1951 to 1967, more than four million peasants were forced to leave their villages.

　　丧失土地　深受剥削　流落异乡
    意大利农民处境悲惨
    本报讯　在意大利农村，封建主义的剥削和资本主义的吞并，使广大农民失去土地，流落异乡，生活困苦。
    今天的意大利，一小撮地主占有大量耕地，而广大农民无地或少地。例如在撒丁地区，百分之一点八的地主占有百分之四十三点九的土地，百分之八十二点八的人则只占有百分之五十六点一的土地。许多农民不得不向地主租地，受地主的剥削。
    受剥削最重的是牧民。地主把土地租给牧民，牧民们要向地主交出他们出售的产品毛值的百分之三十五到百分之七十。这一数字占牧业生产总收入的一半。牧民生产的奶制品卖出去还要受资本家的剥削。资本家垄断着一切，他们用压低价格来掠夺牧民。碰到天灾歉收，牧民们只得借债度日。而这些债用一年的收入也偿付不了。
    资本家和封建地主穷凶极恶地压榨农民，迫使农民破产卖地，离乡背井到城市或外国去当苦力。从一九五一年到一九六七年被迫离开农村的农民，就有四百万以上。
