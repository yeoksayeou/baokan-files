The reprinted report by Chairman Mao on March 5, 1949, at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, is a landmark Marxist-Leninist document. It profoundly summarizes the struggle between the two lines within the Party during the democratic revolution period, analyzes the new situation of class struggle after the basic victory of the democratic revolution, and proposes the great program of transforming the democratic revolution into a socialist revolution, establishing and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and building socialism. It is a sharp ideological weapon against revisionism and against the right and "left" opportunist lines in the entire transitional period. This great revolutionary program has illuminated the entire process of socialist revolution and socialist construction over the past nineteen years. Studying this report is of great significance for implementing the tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, for deeply understanding the history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party, for understanding Chairman Mao's theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, for thoroughly criticizing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist ideology, for thoroughly exposing the treacherous crimes of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, and for carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out: Historical experience is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, should be constantly and repeatedly discussed. It is not enough to discuss it with a few people; it should be made known to the broad revolutionary masses. Chairman Mao's extremely important instruction points out that we must repeatedly and deeply conduct education on the struggle between the two lines among the masses, so that the broad revolutionary masses can firmly grasp Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and consciously criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line and various erroneous tendencies.

The struggle between the lines within the Party reflects the class struggle in society. The history of our Party is the history of the struggle between the two lines. The correct proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao has developed in the struggle against various erroneous bourgeois reactionary lines. Our Party has gone through struggles against the erroneous lines of Chen Duxiu, Qu Qiubai, Li Lisan, Wang Ming, and especially against the bourgeois reactionary line represented by Liu Shaoqi. It can be said that the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the bourgeois reactionary line represented by Liu Shaoqi have engaged in sharp struggles at every important moment and on every major issue in the development of the Chinese revolution.

At the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Liu Shaoqi, together with Wang Ming, opposed Chairman Mao's proposal for the independent and autonomous principle within the Anti-Japanese National United Front, opposed the leadership of the proletariat, and adopted the tactics of a counter-revolutionary two-faced person, attempting to help the Kuomintang reactionaries extinguish the Communist Party and the liberated areas. The correct line represented by Chairman Mao smashed the right-opportunist line of Wang Ming and Liu Shaoqi, thus achieving victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan. After the defeat and surrender of Japanese imperialism, Liu Shaoqi immediately came out to oppose the line proposed by Chairman Mao at the Seventh National Congress of the Party, which was to mobilize the masses, strengthen the people's forces, and under the leadership of our Party, defeat the invaders and build a new China. He falsely advocated a so-called "peaceful democratic new stage," attempting to disintegrate the People's Liberation Army, hand China over to American imperialism, continue the rule of the Kuomintang bandits, and turn China into a colony of American imperialism. Chairman Mao opposed Liu Shaoqi's treacherous line, calling on the people of the entire nation to smash the Kuomintang reactionaries' attacks, carry out a new people's revolution, wage a great people's liberation war, and resolutely struggle to thoroughly overthrow the reactionary rule of American imperialism and the Kuomintang. The brilliant victory of Chairman Mao's line gave birth to the great People's Republic of China.

The Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, held on the eve of the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, marked the beginning of a new stage in the struggle between the two lines.

After the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, overthrew the Kuomintang reactionary rule, what was the principal contradiction within the country? What kind of country should we build? Which path should we take? On these issues, the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the bourgeois reactionary line represented by Liu Shaoqi engaged in extremely fierce struggles.

In his report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, Chairman Mao used Marxist-Leninist class analysis to scientifically and profoundly analyze the classes, class contradictions, and class struggles after the national victory, pointing out the fundamental differences between the correct line and the erroneous line on various issues, and pointing out that the basic contradiction within the country would be between the working class and the bourgeoisie. He emphasized the need to rely wholeheartedly on the working class, emphasized the state power of the People's Republic led by the working class, which, after the victory of the people's democratic revolution, should not be weakened but strengthened. He emphasized that the People's Liberation Army is forever a fighting force and at the same time a working force, which must always be closely linked with the masses. The report pointed out the need to follow the socialist path under the leadership of the proletariat and specifically pointed out the necessary path for China to achieve socialist transformation, setting out a clear line, policy, and direction for gradually achieving national industrialization, gradually achieving national socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce.

The turning point of the revolution is the time when the true face of the revisionists can be most clearly seen. After the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, Liu Shaoqi quickly rushed to Tianjin, where he became very friendly with the bourgeoisie, loudly advocating that China had "too few capitalists" and that the working class was "unreliable," advocating reliance on the bourgeoisie, development of capitalism, and taking the capitalist path. Liu Shaoqi fiercely opposed Chairman Mao's report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, attempting to erase the basic contradiction within the country after the basic conclusion of the democratic revolution stage, which was between the working class and the bourgeoisie, and advocating that capitalists "deserve exploitation," fiercely opposing agricultural cooperation, and striving to prevent the democratic revolution from transforming into a socialist revolution. This proved that he was a loyal slave of imperialism and its running dogs.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "We must learn to fight against imperialists, the Kuomintang, and the bourgeoisie in cities in political, economic, and cultural struggles, and against imperialists in diplomatic struggles. We must learn to fight against them both openly and covertly. If we do not pay attention to these issues, do not learn to fight against these people and achieve victory in the struggle, we will not be able to maintain our power, we will not be able to stand firm, and we will fail. After the enemies with guns are eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist, and they will inevitably fight to the death with us. We must not underestimate these enemies. If we do not raise and recognize these issues in this way, we will make a great mistake."

Chairman Mao's extremely important judgment, with the penetrating power of Marxism-Leninism, foresaw the entire process of the socialist revolution over the past nineteen years, which can be said to be the general guideline for all our work. After nineteen years of practice, looking back at Chairman Mao's instructions, we feel an inexplicable closeness, as if they were spoken specifically about our current struggles. The history of the nineteen years is the history of the working class and the broad revolutionary masses continuing to fight against imperialists, the Kuomintang, and the bourgeoisie in political, economic, and cultural struggles after the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The center of the struggle, as Chairman Mao pointed out, is the issue of power, and around the issue of power are the issues of attitude towards the masses, whether to acknowledge or deny the great socialist initiative hidden among the broad masses, whether to support or suppress the proletariat, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals in their struggle against the bourgeoisie. The counter-revolutionary Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices have fiercely opposed the dictatorship of the proletariat in politics, economics, and culture, suppressed the socialist revolution, and are the agents of imperialism, the Kuomintang, and the bourgeoisie within the Party.

Over the past decade, on the issue of the principal contradiction within the country, on the issue of whether to take the socialist path or the capitalist path, on the issue of fighting against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, during the various socialist transformation movements after entering the cities in 1949, during the basic completion of the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce in 1956, during the rightist onslaught in 1957, during the Lushan Conference in 1959, during the temporary difficulties in the national economy from 1960 to 1962, during the socialist education movement in 1964, and during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in 1966, Liu Shaoqi and his clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party have always represented the interests of the bourgeoisie and the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and have struggled "to the death" against Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line from the right or in the form of "left" but right.

Liu Shaoqi and his clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party have spread a set of counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies, attempting to stop the advance of the socialist revolution in our country and attempting to make our country regress from the socialist path to the capitalist path. In the cities, they opposed Chairman Mao's line of relying on the working class and carrying out socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, advocating the revisionist theory of class cooperation, and utilizing the advantages of the bourgeoisie in cultural departments to recruit a group of traitors and spies, fiercely carrying out counter-revolutionary dictatorship against the proletariat in the cultural field and preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. In the countryside, they failed to oppose Chairman Mao's line of socialist cooperation, and then came up with a so-called "massive reduction of cooperatives"; after their "massive reduction" plot was smashed by Chairman Mao's line, they waited for an opportunity, fabricated excuses, attempted to strangle the fruits of socialism, and disintegrate the collective economy, regressing to the so-called "responsibility system to the household" and "land to the household." The great regression they attempted to implement could only regress to the darkest semi-colonial, semi-feudal path of old China.

It is clear that Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices denied the class contradictions and class struggles in the transitional period, precisely because they needed a counter-revolutionary theoretical basis to support the landlords, bourgeoisie, and various reactionaries in their cruel and ruthless suppression of the working class, peasant class, and revolutionary intellectuals.

Every time such a turning point in class struggle comes, Chairman Mao's report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee is like a magic mirror that reveals the counter-revolutionary faces of these demons and monsters, making us wake up. We need to seriously review the history of these struggles, further thoroughly criticize and expose Liu Shaoqi and his counter-revolutionary revisionist line, eliminate its poison, and at the same time learn from the history of the struggle between the two lines, raise our awareness of executing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao and participated in by hundreds of millions of people, is the decisive battle between the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the counter-revolutionary revisionist line represented by Liu Shaoqi. At the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, Chairman Mao issued the great big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters," which exposed the long-existing struggle between the two lines and two headquarters within the Party, tore off Liu Shaoqi's revolutionary disguise, and declared the failure of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. The military and people of the entire nation, following the revolutionary course indicated by Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters," went through repeated class struggles and finally dug out Liu Shaoqi, the most treacherous and vicious counter-revolutionary leader, dug out his small group of counter-revolutionary accomplices, and smashed his bourgeois headquarters.

The waves of class struggle follow one after another, and the agents of the bourgeoisie always come to the stage to perform and throw out their reactionary lines. It is impossible for them not to perform. Liu Shaoqi is no exception. No matter how many times Chairman Mao warns him, no matter how many times his plots are defeated by Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, he never gives up, always opposes the line set by Chairman Mao in his report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, always does not deviate from the logic of making trouble, failing, making trouble again, failing again, until annihilation. Like all reactionaries, Liu Shaoqi always overestimates his own strength and underestimates the strength of the masses. However, Mao Zedong Thought is invincible, and the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are invincible. The traitor Liu Shaoqi will inevitably meet his complete downfall.

Chairman Mao recently taught us: "This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is completely necessary and very timely for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist restoration, and building socialism."

From Chairman Mao's report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee in 1949 to the "Bombard the Headquarters" in 1966, this is the red thread running through the socialist revolutionary period until the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Looking back at the decades, especially since the founding of the nation, the Party and the revolutionary people have engaged in heart-pounding struggles against Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, making us see more clearly the great historical significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, and more deeply understand the correctness of the theory, line, policy, and direction of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, which Chairman Mao laid the foundation for in his report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee and later continuously enriched and developed.

At that time, Chairman Mao pointed out to the broad revolutionary cadres: "Because of the victory, the people thank us, and the bourgeoisie will also come to praise us. The enemy's military force cannot conquer us, which has been proven. The bourgeoisie's praise may conquer the weak-willed among our ranks." Chairman Mao's instruction is so wise and correct, and so caring for revolutionary cadres! Chairman Mao pointed out the need to "prevent" the attacks of the bourgeoisie's sugar-coated bullets, which has been completely proven by the history of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. At present, at the time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved great and decisive victories, everyone should review Chairman Mao's instruction, draw great lessons, and arouse our high revolutionary vigilance. "We must make our comrades continue to maintain the style of being modest, prudent, and free from arrogance and impetuosity, and we must make our comrades continue to maintain the style of hard struggle." All revolutionary comrades must never forget Chairman Mao's teaching.

We must closely unite around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, fully utilize the counter-revolutionary revisionist Liu Shaoqi as a negative example, continue to deeply carry out the great criticism, and in the great criticism, seriously study the historical experience of the struggle between the two lines within the Party, study Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, further arm ourselves with Chairman Mao's theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and raise our awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. We must clearly see that the struggle between the two classes, the two paths, and the two lines will continue for a long time. The ongoing struggle, criticism, and transformation, to reform the superstructure that does not adapt to the socialist economic base, is the continuation of the struggle between the two lines. We must raise it to the height of consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration, and must do it well and thoroughly. In such learning, struggle, criticism, and reform, Chairman Mao's report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee and Chairman Mao's many other important works are our best textbooks, best guides, and best weapons.

Let us carry out the movement to study the history of the struggle between the two lines more deeply throughout the country!

Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

    认真学习两条路线斗争的历史
    《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》社论
    今天重新发表的毛主席一九四九年三月五日《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》，是一个具有划时代意义的马克思列宁主义文献。它深刻地总结了民主革命时期党内两条路线的斗争，分析了民主革命获得基本胜利后阶级斗争的新形势，提出了从新民主主义革命转变为社会主义革命、建立和巩固无产阶级专政、建设社会主义的伟大纲领，是在整个过渡时期反对修正主义、反对“左”右倾机会主义路线的锐利的思想武器。这个伟大的革命纲领，照耀着十九年来社会主义革命和社会主义建设的整个历史进程。学习这个报告，对于贯彻执行第八届扩大的十二中全会提出的各项任务，对于深刻理解党内两条路线斗争的历史，理解毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的学说，对于彻底批判刘少奇的反革命修正主义思想，彻底清算叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇叛党、叛国的滔天罪行，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，具有十分重大的意义。
    毛主席最近指出：历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。毛主席这个极其重要的指示，指出了我们必须在群众中反复地、深入地进行两条路线斗争的教育，使广大革命群众都能够牢牢地掌握毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，自觉地批判刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线和各种错误倾向。
    党内的路线斗争，反映了社会上的阶级斗争。我们党的历史，就是两条路线的斗争史。以毛主席为代表的正确的无产阶级革命路线，是在同各种错误的资产阶级反动路线作斗争中发展起来的。我们党经历了同陈独秀、瞿秋白、李立三、王明的右的或“左”的错误路线的斗争，特别是同以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级反动路线作了反复的长期的斗争。可以说，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，和以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级反动路线，在中国革命发展的每一个重要时刻、每一个重大问题上，都进行了尖锐的斗争。
    抗日战争开始，刘少奇同王明一起，反对毛主席提出的抗日民族统一战线中独立自主的原则，反对无产阶级的领导权，他采取反革命两面派的手法，妄图帮助蒋介石反动派扑灭共产党和解放区。以毛主席为代表的正确路线粉碎了王明、刘少奇的右倾机会主义路线，因而获得了抗日战争的胜利。在日本帝国主义侵略战争失败、宣告投降以后，刘少奇马上跳出来，反对毛主席提出的在党的第七次全国代表大会上通过的放手发动群众，壮大人民力量，在我们党的领导下，打败侵略者，建设新中国的路线，胡说所谓“和平民主新阶段”，妄图瓦解人民解放军，把中国送给美帝国主义，妄图继续保留蒋介石匪帮的统治，使中国成为美帝国主义的殖民地。毛主席反对刘少奇这样一个亡国路线，号召全国人民粉碎国民党反动派的进攻，进行新的人民大革命，举行伟大的人民解放战争，为彻底推翻美帝国主义和蒋介石反动统治而坚决斗争。毛主席这条路线的光辉胜利，诞生了伟大的中华人民共和国。
    在中国人民大革命即将取得全国胜利前夕召开的党的七届二中全会，标志着两条路线的斗争进入了新的阶段。
    中国人民在中国共产党领导下推翻国民党反动统治以后，国内的主要矛盾是什么？我们要建设一个什么样的国家？要走什么道路？在这个问题上，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，和以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级反动路线进行了极其剧烈的斗争。
    毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告，用马克思列宁主义的阶级分析，科学地、深刻地分析了全国胜利后的阶级、阶级矛盾、阶级斗争，指出了正确路线同错误路线在各个问题上的根本分歧，指出国内的基本矛盾将是工人阶级和资产阶级的矛盾，强调必须全心全意地依靠工人阶级，强调工人阶级领导的人民共和国的国家政权，在人民民主革命胜利以后，不是可以削弱，而是必须强化。强调人民解放军永远是一个战斗队，同时人民解放军又是一个工作队，要永远密切联系群众。报告指出了必须在无产阶级领导下走社会主义道路，并且具体指出了中国实现社会主义改造的必由之路，为逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，逐步实现国家对农业、对手工业和对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，规定了极其明确的路线、方针和政策。
    革命的转折关头，最能够识别修正主义者的真面目。刘少奇在七届二中全会以后，很快跑到天津，同资产阶级打得火热，大肆叫嚣中国资本家“太少”，工人阶级“不可靠”，主张依靠资产阶级，发展资本主义，走资本主义道路。刘少奇疯狂地反对毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告，妄图抹杀在民主革命阶段基本结束之后国内的基本矛盾是工人阶级和资产阶级的矛盾，鼓吹什么资本家“剥削有功”，疯狂地反对农业合作化，拚命地反对民主革命向社会主义革命转变，恰恰证明他是帝国主义及其走狗的忠实奴才。
    毛主席指出：“必须学会在城市中向帝国主义者、国民党、资产阶级作政治斗争、经济斗争和文化斗争，并向帝国主义者作外交斗争。既要学会同他们作公开的斗争，又要学会同他们作荫蔽的斗争。如果我们不去注意这些问题，不去学会同这些人作这些斗争，并在斗争中取得胜利，我们就不能维持政权，我们就会站不住脚，我们就会失败。在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。如果我们现在不是这样地提出问题和认识问题，我们就要犯极大的错误。”
    毛主席这个极其重要的论断，以马克思列宁主义的洞察力，预见到这十九年来社会主义革命的整个进程，可以说是我们一切工作的一个总纲。经过了这十九年的实践，再回过头去读毛主席这段指示，感到无比的亲切，就好象是针对我们当前的斗争讲的一样。十九年的历史，就是无产阶级专政建立之后，工人阶级和广大革命群众继续同帝国主义者、国民党、资产阶级进行政治斗争、经济斗争、文化斗争的历史。斗争的中心，正如毛主席指出的，是政权问题，而围绕着政权问题的，是对待人民群众的态度问题，是承认或者否认广大人民群众中蕴藏着极大的社会主义积极性的问题，是支持或者镇压无产阶级、贫下中农、革命知识分子进行反对资产阶级的社会主义革命的问题。刘少奇这个反革命分子及其同伙，在政治、经济、文化各方面，都疯狂地反对无产阶级专政，镇压社会主义革命，他们是帝国主义、国民党、资产阶级在党内的代理人。
    十多年来，在国内主要矛盾的问题上，在走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路的问题上，在同帝、修、反作斗争的问题上，在一九四九年进城以后各项社会主义改造运动中、一九五六年基本完成对农业、手工业、资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的时候、一九五七年右派猖狂进攻的时候、一九五九年庐山会议、一九六○年到一九六二年国民经济遇到暂时困难的时候、一九六四年的社会主义教育运动、一九六六年无产阶级文化大革命运动等各个重大历史时期，刘少奇及其一伙党内的走资派，都曾经代表了资产阶级和地富反坏右的利益，从右的方面或以形“左”实右的形式，向毛主席的无产阶级革命路线进行过
  “拚死的斗争”。刘少奇同他一伙党内的走资派，散布了整套的反革命修正主义谬论，妄图阻止我国社会主义革命的前进，妄图使我国从社会主义道路大倒退到资本主义道路。在城市，他们反对毛主席的依靠工人阶级、对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的路线，鼓吹修正主义的阶级合作论，并且利用资产阶级在文化部门的优势，搜罗了一批叛徒特务，疯狂地在文化领域中向无产阶级进行反革命的专政，为资本主义复辟作舆论准备。在农村，他们反对毛主席的社会主义合作化路线没有得逞，随后就来一个所谓“大砍合作社”；他们的“大砍”阴谋被毛主席的路线粉碎以后，就又等待时机，制造借口，妄图扼杀社会主义的果实，瓦解集体经济，大倒退为所谓“包产到户”、“分田到户”。他们妄图实行的这种大倒退，只能是大倒退到旧中国最黑暗的半殖民地、半封建的道路。
    很清楚，刘少奇及其同伙否认过渡时期的阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，正是为了建立一个支持地主、资产阶级和各种反动派残酷无情地镇压工人阶级、农民阶级和革命知识分子的反革命理论根据的需要。
    每当这种阶级斗争转折关头，毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告，就象照妖镜一样照出了这群牛鬼蛇神的反革命面貌，使我们头脑清醒起来。我们需要认真重温这些斗争的历史，进一步把刘少奇及其反革命修正主义路线彻底批臭，批透，清除它的毒素，同时从两条路线的斗争史中吸取历史教训，提高我们执行毛主席无产阶级革命路线的自觉性。
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的、有亿万群众参加的无产阶级文化大革命，是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线和以刘少奇为代表的反革命修正主义路线长期斗争的大决战。毛主席在八届十一中全会上，发表了具有伟大历史意义的《炮打司令部》的大字报，揭开了党内长期存在的两条路线、两个司令部斗争的盖子，撕下了刘少奇伪装革命的画皮，宣告了刘少奇反革命修正主义路线的破产。全国军民按照毛主席《炮打司令部》大字报指引的革命航向，经过反复的阶级较量，终于把刘少奇这个最阴险、最凶恶的反革命头子挖出来了，把他的一小撮反革命同伙挖出来了，把他的资产阶级司令部摧垮了。
    阶级斗争一个浪潮接着一个浪潮，资产阶级的代理人总是要登台表演，抛出他们的反动路线。要他们不表演是不可能的。刘少奇也不例外。不管毛主席怎样一次又一次地警告他，不管他的阴谋怎样一次又一次地被毛主席的革命路线所击败，他总是不死心的，总是要反对毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告中所规定的路线的，总是不会违背捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡这个逻辑的。刘少奇同一切反动派一样，总是过高地估计自己的力量，过低地估计人民群众的力量。但是，毛泽东思想是战无不胜的，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民是无敌的，叛徒刘少奇终究逃脱不了彻底垮台的命运。
    毛主席最近教导我们：“这次无产阶级文化大革命，对于巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义，是完全必要的，是非常及时的。”
    从一九四九年毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告到一九六六年《炮打司令部》，这就是直到无产阶级文化大革命开始时贯串在社会主义革命时期的一条红线。
    回顾几十年来，特别是建国以来党和革命人民群众同刘少奇反革命修正主义路线所进行的惊心动魄的斗争，使我们更清楚地看到毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的伟大历史意义，更深刻地认识到毛主席在七届二中全会的报告中就奠定了基础的、后来又不断丰富和发展的无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论、路线、方针、政策的无比正确。
    毛主席在当时就向广大革命干部指出：“因为胜利，人民感谢我们，资产阶级也会出来捧场。敌人的武力是不能征服我们的，这点已经得到证明了。资产阶级的捧场则可能征服我们队伍中的意志薄弱者。”毛主席这个指示是何等英明、何等正确、对革命干部是何等爱护啊！毛主席指出要“预防”资产阶级糖衣炮弹的攻击，以后完全为阶级斗争、两条路线斗争的历史所证实。在当前，在无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大的、决定性的胜利的时候，大家都要重温毛主席这个指示，吸取极大的教益，唤起我们高度的革命警惕。“务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。”一切革命的同志们，千万不可忘记毛主席这个教导。
    我们一定要紧紧团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，充分利用中国赫鲁晓夫刘少奇这个反面教员，继续深入地展开革命大批判，在大批判中认真地学习党内两条路线斗争的历史经验，学好毛主席的一系列最新指示，进一步用毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的学说武装起来，提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟。应当清醒地看到：两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，还将长期继续下去。现在正在进行的斗、批、改，改革不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑，就是两条路线斗争的继续。我们一定要把它提到巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟的高度来认识，务必把它搞好、搞彻底。在这种学习、斗争、批判和改革中，毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告和毛主席许多其他重要著作，就是我们最好的教材，最好的指南，最好的武器。
    让我们在全国更深入地开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动！
    毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！
