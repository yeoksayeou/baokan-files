We have tasted the sweetness of running schools at the brigade level. The suggestion by Comrades Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu to transfer public primary schools to the brigade level is a direction-setting suggestion for the revolution in rural education. It is a good measure to firmly implement Chairman Mao's latest directives. This suggestion resonates deeply with us. Our commune started doing this in September this year. Below, we share our experiences from a few months of practice:

Firstly, the fundamental issue in the rural education revolution is who controls the power of education. The poor and lower-middle peasants of our commune began managing the schools in April and started paying teachers' salaries in work points in September. By transferring public primary schools to the brigade level, the power over personnel, finances, and administration has been fully delegated, ensuring that the poor and lower-middle peasants truly control the power of education. Now, all 21 schools in the commune have established education revolution committees. In most brigades, the deputy head of the revolutionary committee and outstanding representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants serve as the leaders of the education revolution committee. The poor and lower-middle peasants make up 60% of the members of the education revolution committee.

Secondly, transferring public primary schools to the brigade level is a struggle between two educational lines. To win this struggle, we must thoroughly criticize and repudiate the revisionist educational line, completely eliminating the poisonous influence of "exams first" and "grades first." Through revolutionary criticism, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary teachers and students have taken control of rural education in their minds, creating a new situation where everyone cares about the schools.

Thirdly, changing from salary to work points has many advantages. An old poor peasant said: We poor and lower-middle peasants can control the power of education, and we can also afford the teachers' salaries. The educational funds are entirely borne by the production teams, and the grain supply is not requested from the state. Changing from salary to work points is not just about a few dollars; it is about changing the revisionist educational system.

Fourthly, transferring public primary schools to the brigade level and reforming the salary system and other unreasonable regulations is beneficial for teachers to directly receive re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants. This changes the past situation where teachers, although living in the countryside, were detached from the poor and lower-middle peasants, politics, reality, and labor.

Fifthly, by transferring public primary schools to the brigade level, we can cultivate successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause according to the wishes of the poor and lower-middle peasants. In practice, we have implemented a nine-year continuous education system according to the wishes of the poor and lower-middle peasants, ensuring that students do not leave the brigade to attend middle school. Within nine years, we must study and apply the first four volumes of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" well. This is the fundamental course in education. We poor and lower-middle peasants controlling the power of education means controlling who the school doors are open to, who is being cultivated, and what is being taught.

After our commune implemented the transfer of public primary schools to the brigade level, we also encountered some specific problems. We solved them in practice as follows:

① Regarding the burden on the masses. The educational funds for schools are entirely borne by the production teams. Will this increase the burden on the masses? We believe that the poor and lower-middle peasants can fully afford the appropriate increase in educational funds. However, according to Chairman Mao's brilliant "May 7th Directive," we organize revolutionary teachers and students to participate in labor and engage in agricultural and sideline production, which can increase a considerable portion of income for the brigade. Thus, the burden on the masses will not increase significantly.

② Regarding the teachers' living conditions after changing to work points. We believe that the suggestion by Comrades Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu is correct. Work points should be evaluated based on the teachers' thoughts and work. For those with difficulties in living conditions, appropriate subsidies should be provided, ensuring that their living standards are not lower than those of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

③ Regarding the teacher shortage in the nine-year continuous education system. How to solve the teacher shortage? Based on our actual situation, the commune can basically solve the teacher shortage. In our 21 schools, every team has a middle school, and every school has selected part-time teachers from the poor and lower-middle peasants. They are both farmers and teachers, giving classes to the schools on a regular basis. If there are not enough teachers, we can also adjust a small number of teachers between teams and communes, thus completely solving the teacher shortage.

④ Regarding the funding issue. We adhere to the thorough revolutionary spirit, changing the salaries of middle school teachers to work points, and not relying on the state for funds. Currently, nine brigades have middle school classes with few students, so we temporarily implement joint operation between brigades, with the funds borne by each brigade.

⑤ Regarding the adjustment of teachers. Our commune currently has 260 teachers, and we plan to gradually transfer them to the brigades to become commune members in batches, so they can receive re-education from the poor and lower-middle peasants. We plan to transfer 58 teachers in the first batch. The principle for adjusting teachers is based on the needs of the poor and lower-middle peasants running the schools.

　　我们尝到了大队办学的甜头
    侯振民、王庆余两同志关于公办小学下放到大队办的建议，是农村教育革命方向性的建议，是坚决落实毛主席最新指示的好措施，这个建议说到我们心坎上了。我们公社从今年九月就开始这样做了，下面谈谈我们几个月实践的体会：
    第一，农村教育革命的根本问题，就是教育大权由谁来掌握的问题。我们水源公社贫下中农今年四月开始管理学校，九月开始教师工资全部改为记工分。公办小学下放到大队来办，学校的文权、人权、财权统统下放，保证了贫下中农真正掌握教育大权。现在，全公社二十一所学校都成立了教育革命委员会，多数大队由革委会副主任和优秀的贫下中农代表担任教育革委会的第一把手，贫下中农在教育革委会成员中占百分之六十。
    第二，公办小学下放到大队来办，是一场两条教育路线的斗争，要想在这场斗争中取得胜利，必须把修正主义教育路线批倒批臭，彻底肃清“升学第一”“分数第一”等修正主义流毒。通过革命大批判，使广大贫下中农、革命干部、革命师生，从思想上掌握了农村教育大权，出现了人人关心学校的新局面。
    第三，工资制改为工分制，好处很多。老贫农说：我们贫下中农能够掌握教育大权，教师的工资也能负担得起。教育经费全部不向国家伸手，粮食供应不向国家要。由工资制改为工分制，不是为了几个钱的问题，而是改掉了修正主义的教育制度。
    第四，公办小学下放到大队来办，并对工资和其他不合理的规章制度进行改革，有利于教师直接接受贫下中农再教育，改变了过去教师身在农村，脱离贫下中农，脱离政治，脱离实际，脱离劳动的现象。
    第五，公办小学下放到大队来办，就能按照贫下中农的心意培养无产阶级革命事业的接班人。我们在实践中，按照贫下中农的心愿作到了上中学不出大队，实行九年一贯制。九年内要把《毛泽东选集》一至四卷学好用好，这是根本的教育课。我们贫下中农掌握教育大权，就是掌握学校为谁开门、培养什么人、教什么书的问题。
    我们水源公社实行公办小学下放到大队来办以后，也遇到了一些具体问题。我们在实践中是这样解决的：
    ①关于群众负担问题。学校教育经费，完全由生产队包下来，是否加重了群众的负担呢？我们认为，适当地增加群众办学的经费，贫下中农是完全负担得起的。但是，我们按照毛主席光辉的“五·七”指示，组织革命师生参加劳动，搞农副业生产，可以为大队增加相当一部分收入。这样，群众负担不会有较大的增加。
    ②教师的工资改为记工分后，生活上是不是会发生问题。我们认为，侯振民、王庆余两位同志建议是正确的。工分要根据教师的思想、工作来评定，对生活上有困难的适当予以补助，原则上是不低于贫下中农的生活水平。
    ③七年一贯制的师资问题。缺少师资怎么办？根据我们的实际情况看，师资问题公社基本上是可以解决的。我们二十一所学校，队队有中学，校校都从贫下中农中选拔了兼职教员，他们既是农民，又是教员，定期给学校上课。教师不足，我们队与队之间，社与社之间还可作少量的调整，就完全解决了师资问题。
    ④经费问题。我们本着彻底革命的思想，把中学的教师的工资也一律改为工分，不由国家负担经费。目前九个大队有中学班，人数少，就暂时实行队与队之间的联办，经费由各大队负担。
    ⑤关于教师调整问题。我们公社现有二百六十名教师，计划用分批分期下放到大队当社员的办法，使他们接受贫下中农再教育。我们第一批准备下放五十八名。教师调整原则，根据贫下中农办学的需要来定。
