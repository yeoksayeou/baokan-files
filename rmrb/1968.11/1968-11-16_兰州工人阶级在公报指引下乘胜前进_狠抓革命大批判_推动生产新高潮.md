Inspired by the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the working class of Lanzhou, with boundless proletarian affection for the great leader Chairman Mao, has launched a new wave of revolution and production. The broad masses of revolutionary workers are determined to strive with the spirit of "seizing the day" for fifty days, to complete and overfulfill the annual production plan, and to make new contributions to the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

After the communiqué was issued, the working class of Lanzhou immediately placed the study, propaganda, and implementation of the various great combat tasks proposed by the plenary session in the most important position. During the study of the communiqué, they reviewed the more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, re-examined the series of latest instructions given by the great leader Chairman Mao in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and gained a deeper understanding that "this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is completely necessary and very timely for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist restoration, and building socialism." With boundless proletarian affection for the great leader Chairman Mao, they enthusiastically praised the great achievements of the great leader Chairman Mao, praised the correct leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, praised the important role played by the Central Cultural Revolution Group in implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and praised the great and decisive victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They resolutely declared that they would follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, earnestly implement the various combat tasks proposed by the plenary session, and strive for the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Under the guidance of the communiqué, in recent days, revolutionary workers in all factories and enterprises across the city, with boundless hatred for the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, have launched a high tide of revolutionary criticism. From the factory area to the dormitory, from the workshop to the dining hall, everywhere is a battlefield for denouncing Liu Shaoqi. Criticism meetings, denunciation meetings, and accusation meetings are held day and night, and big-character posters and blackboard newspapers are everywhere. The broad masses of revolutionary workers deeply expose and criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by Liu Shaoqi and his agents, and angrily denounce the heinous crimes of Liu Shaoqi and other top capitalist-roaders within the party who attempted to restore capitalism. They declared that they would definitely criticize the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi to the point where he stinks to high heaven and can never rise again.

The revolutionary workers in various factories, mines, and enterprises in the Lanzhou region have set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes focusing on studying the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee. They use the various combat tasks proposed by the plenary session as a yardstick to examine and summarize the situation of revolution and production since this year, and have revised the production plans from the bottom up and formulated production increase measures, quickly launching a new wave of revolution and production. The revolutionary workers in many factories and mines such as Lanzhou General Machinery Factory, Lanzhou Refinery, Dongfanghong Glass Factory, Lanzhou Measuring Tools and Cutting Tools Factory, Agang Town Coal Mine, and Lanzhou May 1st Chemical Factory, who have completed the production plan ahead of schedule every month, have carried forward the thorough revolutionary and continuous revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, overcome complacency, advance in victory, and are determined to create new achievements and strive for the goal of "building our socialist industry, socialist agriculture, and all socialist undertakings even better" proposed by the plenary session. Some factories with relatively poor performance have decided, under the inspiration of the communiqué, to redouble their efforts to seize the revolution and promote production, striving to complete the annual production plan.

In recent days, the entire industrial front in Lanzhou has seen a great revolutionary situation, with production booming and good news coming in frequently. Revolutionary workers in many factories and enterprises have challenged each other and launched a revolutionary competition. The revolutionary workers of Agang Town Coal Mine, after six days of struggle following the issuance of the communiqué, completed the annual coal production plan 54 days ahead of schedule on the 7th of this month. The members of the revolutionary committee of Lanzhou Dongfanghong Glass Factory and the military support personnel stationed in the factory went deep into the workshops, studied, propagated, and implemented the communiqué with the workers, and with greater revolutionary enthusiasm, threw themselves into the battle of seizing the revolution and promoting production, making the production increase significantly. The glass output of the entire factory increased by more than 80% compared to the same period last month. The broad masses of revolutionary workers in Lanzhou Refinery, following Chairman Mao's teaching that the working class must lead everything, organized extensive worker amateur investigation teams to conduct in-depth and detailed investigations into many "old and difficult" problems in the entire factory, and with the spirit of "seizing the day," investigated, summarized, and proposed reform measures while investigating, effectively promoting the struggle, criticism, and transformation and various production developments in the entire factory.

　　兰州工人阶级在公报指引下乘胜前进
　　狠抓革命大批判  推动生产新高潮
    据新华社兰州十四日电　在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的鼓舞下，兰州地区的工人阶级怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限深厚的无产阶级感情，掀起了抓革命、促生产的新高潮。广大革命工人决心以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，奋战五十天，完成和超额完成全年生产计划，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利作出新贡献。
    全会公报发表以后，兰州地区的工人阶级立即把学习、宣传公报和落实全会提出的各项伟大战斗任务，摆在最重要的地位。他们在学习公报时，回顾了两年多来无产阶级文化大革命的战斗历程，重温了伟大领袖毛主席在无产阶级文化大革命中所作的一系列最新指示，更加深刻地认识到“这次无产阶级文化大革命，对于巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义，是完全必要的，是非常及时的。”他们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无比深厚的无产阶级感情，热情地歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的丰功伟绩，歌颂以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的正确领导，歌颂中央文革在贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的斗争中所起的重要作用，歌颂无产阶级文化大革命取得的伟大的、决定性的胜利，坚决表示要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，认真落实全会提出的各项战斗任务，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而奋斗。
    在全会公报的指引下，连日来，全市各工厂企业广大革命职工怀着对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的无比仇恨，掀起了革命大批判的高潮。从厂区到宿舍，从车间到饭厅，到处是声讨刘少奇的战场。批判会、声讨会、控诉会昼夜不断，大字报、黑板报到处都有。广大革命职工深揭狠批刘少奇及其代理人推行的反革命修正主义路线，愤怒声讨刘少奇等党内最大的一小撮走资派复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。他们表示，一定要把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇批得臭不可闻，叫他永世不得翻身。
    兰州地区各厂矿、企业的革命工人，大办以学习八届十二中全会公报为内容的毛泽东思想学习班。他们以全会提出的各项战斗任务为尺子，对照检查今年以来抓革命、促生产的情况，总结经验，并且自下而上地修订了生产计划，制订了增产措施，迅速掀起了一个抓革命、促生产的新高潮。月月超额完成生产计划的兰州通用机器厂、兰州炼油厂、东方红玻璃厂、兰州量具刃具厂、阿干镇煤矿、兰州五一化工厂等许多工矿企业的革命职工，发扬无产阶级的彻底革命和不断革命精神，克服自满情绪，乘胜前进，决心再创新成绩，向全会提出的“把我国的社会主义工业、社会主义农业和一切社会主义事业建设得更加出色”的目标奋斗。一些任务完成得较差的工厂，革命职工在全会公报的鼓舞下，决心以百倍的努力来狠抓革命，猛促生产，努力完成全年生产计划。
    连日来，兰州市整个工业战线革命形势大好，生产蒸蒸日上，捷报频传。许多工厂企业的革命职工互相挑战，展开了革命竞赛。阿干镇煤矿革命职工在公报发表以后，经过六天奋战，于本月七日提前五十四天完成了全年煤炭生产计划。兰州东方红玻璃厂革委会成员和驻厂解放军支左人员深入车间，和工人一起学习、宣传、落实公报，以更大的革命干劲投入抓革命、促生产的战斗，使生产大幅度增长。全厂玻璃产量比上月同期增长百分之八十以上。兰州炼油厂广大革命职工遵照毛主席工人阶级必须领导一切的教导，广泛组织工人业余调查组，对全厂许多“老大难”问题进行深入细致的调查研究，并且以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，边调查，边总结，边提出改革措施，有力地促进了全厂斗、批、改和各项生产的发展。
