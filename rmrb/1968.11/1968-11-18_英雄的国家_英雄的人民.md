Heroic Nation, Heroic People

On the heroic land of Albania, wherever you go, you will hear many inspiring stories of heroes. When you live among a people brimming with revolutionary heroism and patriotism, inspired by the brilliant deeds of countless heroes, you will further understand the profound significance of the great leader Chairman Mao's words: "Heroic Albania, a great beacon of socialism in Europe." Whenever I chat with enthusiastic Albanian comrades, they always passionately introduce to me the story of Adam Reka, who sacrificed his life to defend socialist property at the port of Durres, the fearless spirit of Mehamed Hyshu and Milbejza Kepi, who fought against the flames at the Linas oil mine for the people, and the moving deeds of Skuta Vata and her daughter at the LogjcÃ«n-Fieri railway construction site.

Once, a worker comrade from the "Mihal Duri" Printing Factory told me: "Since the revolutionary movement, there have been so many heroes! Our factory's model custodian, the famous revolutionary veteran Uncle Matis, is a truly remarkable figure. Everyone in Tirana knows about him!"

One day, accompanied by Comrade Bulqiza, I came to the factory warehouse. As soon as I entered, a white-haired old man in his fifties, smiling warmly, greeted me from beside the stack of paper. "Ah! Isn't this the old man I met the other day in the wilderness near the factory, who personally taught a little girl how to shoot a gun?" I joyfully shook the old man's hand. After Comrade Bulqiza introduced him, I learned that he was indeed the "respected revolutionary veteran" and model custodian, Uncle Matis, whom the worker comrades praised.

The old man led me to the office and even brewed a cup of Chinese green tea for me. He was a very talkative old man. Originally, I had asked him to share his own deeds, but he always steered the conversation elsewhere.

"Young man! I have nothing much to say about myself. Let's talk about the revolutionary heroism of the Albanian people!" The old man took a deep puff of his cigarette, paused for a moment, and then began to speak with great emotion:

"In the socialist spring garden of our country, so many brilliant revolutionary flowers have bloomed! These flowers are nurtured by the Party of Labor and Comrade Enver Hoxha. They bloom on every front of building the motherland, defending the motherland, and the revolutionary movement. Names like Reka and Skuta are already famous nationwide; you will know about them even if I don't mention them. Now, let me tell you about the heroic deeds of the soldier Marashi and the agricultural cooperative member Bajdimi!"

Matis continued: "Marashi grew up in the rugged mountains and has worked in the ranks of the working class for many years. The life of the working class has instilled in him a high sense of collectivism. Later, he became a soldier of the people's army, fearlessly overcoming difficulties and hardships, and growing stronger in the intense life of battle.

"Bajdimi is an outstanding member of the Banaja Agricultural Cooperative near Fier. He treats the local garrison as his own family and has formed a brotherly bond with Marashi.

"One day, an order came to Marashi and Bajdimi to carry out an important mission together. In our Albania, the military and the people are one family. Although Bajdimi is a member of the agricultural cooperative, he can also shoot a gun. When it comes to carrying out missions, he is just as capable as a soldier. The platoon leader said to everyone: 'Comrades! From today, we will undergo several days of military training to complete an important task: to blow up a fortress just like in real combat. To successfully complete this task, we need explosives experts. Who is willing to go?'

"The platoon leader's words were not yet finished when everyone shouted in unison: 'Me! Me!' Among these people were Marashi and Bajdimi.

"For several days of military training, the explosives experts encountered many difficulties. Their shared revolutionary ideals deepened their brotherly combat friendship.

"In the dead of night, a fierce wind swept through the wilderness, followed by a torrential downpour. It was a rare night of storm and rain. The wind uprooted corn stalks, and even some trees were uprooted. The platoon leader ordered everyone: 'Comrades! There is a livestock pen over there. Let's go in and take shelter from the rain!' The explosives experts, upon hearing the order, immediately ran towards the livestock pen. Comrades huddled together for warmth and rest. When the rain stopped, the soldiers returned to the small river where they were to carry out their mission. At this time, everyone noticed that someone was standing motionless in the field. It was Marashi. The rain had soaked his military coat. Everyone asked him: 'Why didn't you come with us to take shelter from the rain?' Marashi replied naturally and honestly: 'There are many materials here that need to be guarded.' Comrades looked at him with admiration and praised: 'Marashi is great, he is always our good example!'

"At dawn, the sound of cannon fire rumbled in the distance, smoke and dust filled the air. Tanks and infantry launched an attack on the 'enemy' positions. The explosives experts were all sweating profusely. After a night of intense battle, they rested briefly in the field to recover from fatigue, as new battle tasks awaited them. Soon, the explosives team leader issued an order to complete the explosives mission ahead of schedule.

"The platoon leader was an experienced old soldier. He knew that to complete such a task, the explosives force needed to be significantly increased. However, the number of people was limited, and others could not help. The platoon leader had developed a habit: whenever he encountered difficulties, he would always recall the guerrilla life of the war years. He called the explosives experts together and spoke.

"The platoon leader's speech aroused the soldiers' determination to overcome difficulties. After hearing the platoon leader's words, Marashi's enthusiasm soared, and he jumped up like a soldier charging towards the enemy in the trenches, shouting: 'We are glorious soldiers nurtured by the Party of Labor. There is no difficulty we cannot overcome!' 'Firmly complete the mission, do not leave the battlefield until the mission is accomplished!' Everyone responded enthusiastically. However, only Bajdimi was frowning, with his head down, lost in thought, because the platoon leader had already informed him not to participate in this battle but to stand guard. Bajdimi had always regarded standing guard as a glorious duty, but on this night, he had another idea: everyone was going to participate in this glorious and arduous explosives mission. An Albanian youth league member should go to the most difficult battle position! He requested the platoon leader, insisting on fighting alongside his comrades. The platoon leader knew this young man's stubbornness and immediately decided to let him participate in the battle with Marashi."

Matis paused for a moment and then continued: "Like other explosives experts, Bajdimi and Marashi made all the preparations. At the platoon leader's command, the two young men leaped forward and ran towards their designated battle positions. 'You pass me the explosives, and I'll light the fuse!' Marashi said. Bajdimi followed his instructions, passing him packet after packet of explosives. Marashi lit the explosives, but because of the speed, one packet of explosives was lit and not pushed out in time. When Bajdimi discovered this packet of explosives, the fuse was almost burned out. In this critical moment, Bajdimi's mind flashed with only one thought: firmly push the explosives packet out and definitely save Marashi. He did not consider his own safety at all, with the composure and calmness characteristic of a revolutionary soldier, thinking about what he had to do. He did not tell Marashi about the impending danger because he knew that if he told Marashi, this soldier who loved the people would sacrifice himself to save him.

"The fuse was about to burn out, and a disaster was about to occur. In these precious seconds, the outstanding member of the agricultural cooperative, Bajdimi, with his eyes shining with heroic light, bravely and accurately hugged the explosives packet and threw it far away. A loud explosion echoed, and Bajdimi felt his hands trembling, his vision blurring, and stars dancing before his eyes. He struggled to stand for a moment before collapsing, and then he knew nothing more. When he woke up in a room, the first thing he asked was: 'Where am I? Where is my gun?' The platoon leader nodded repeatedly, signaling Bajdimi to rest quietly. Bajdimi grabbed the platoon leader's hand and said: 'There is something I need to tell the platoon leader. My gun and gas mask are forgotten in the grass. Please forgive me for not...' The platoon leader walked to Bajdimi's side, carefully examining the face of this wounded soldier, and thought to himself: 'Where do our people draw such great strength from? Bajdimi, to save his comrade, lost both his eyes, yet he still worries about his gun. Respected Party of Labor! You have nurtured tens of thousands of such heroes. Glory belongs to you!'

Matis lit another cigarette and stared intently at the girls on the street, who were marching proudly to the shooting range.

"Uncle Matis, Bajdimi's father must be an old guerrilla fighter, right?" I asked with great respect.

The old man extinguished his cigarette and proudly continued: "Of course! Bajdimi's father, Nazepi, like Skuta's father, upon hearing the news of his son's injury, not only did not shed tears but felt immense pride for the Party and the great leader Comrade Enver Hoxha. In our Albania, those who sacrifice for the motherland will never die. They will forever live in the hearts of the people nationwide. Villagers told Nazepi about Bajdimi's injury, and the old man proudly said: 'Well done! My Bajdimi! Only a hero can be injured like this!'

Uncle Matis's words deeply moved us. Comrade Bulqiza, sitting next to me, sighed: "This is the true spirit of our brave mountain people. Under the nourishment of the Party of Labor, how many new heroes like Marashi, Bajdimi, and their fathers emerge every day!" Comrade Bulqiza's words immediately reminded me of the enthusiastic praise of Uncle Matis by the printing factory workers. I once again invited the old man to share his revolutionary family, but he refused, saying: "My family is an ordinary Albanian worker's family. What little we have done is far from meeting the Party's expectations for us." The old man's humble and simple words aroused even greater respect for him in me. Just as we were having a heated conversation, three fully armed female workers suddenly burst in. A tall girl smiled and said to Uncle Matis: "All the soldiers in our company have lined up, requesting you to teach them bayonet practice!" The old man, upon hearing the words, quickly stood up and said: "I'll go!" Then he turned to me and said: "Look! Our Albanian people are always ready with their guns against the enemy!" Saying this, he kissed me and strode out.

I and Comrade Bulqiza saw the old man off to the door. I was still unsatisfied with not hearing the old man's advanced deeds. Suddenly, I noticed a newspaper under a glass plate on the corner of the table with a portrait of a female comrade. Curiously, I asked Comrade Bulqiza who was in the picture. She took the newspaper from under the glass plate and exclaimed: "Ah! This is Uncle Matis's heroic daughter. Not long ago, all the newspapers reported their advanced deeds!" I took the newspaper, tears of excitement welling up, and read it in one breath.

It turned out that Uncle Matis had a seventeen-year-old daughter named Adelina. She was a worker at the "Enver Hoxha" Factory in Tirana. To respond to the Party of Labor's call, she actively volunteered to build the Tirana-Saranda highway. On the construction site, she displayed boundless revolutionary enthusiasm and was repeatedly awarded the honorable title of labor hero. She organized young people to propagate the Party's various policies for further promoting the revolutionary movement. Once, she fell seriously ill but did not rest. The doctor advised her to go to Tirana for treatment, but she firmly refused, saying: "I came to participate in voluntary labor, not to stay in the hospital to recuperate!" The next day, while blasting a huge rock on a mountain, she bravely sacrificed herself to protect her comrades.

After Adelina's death, Uncle Matis did not shed tears. Instead, he voluntarily requested to take over his daughter's work on the construction site. The heroic deeds spread like lightning across Albania. People rushed to write to newspapers and radio stations, praising Adelina as the "good daughter of the working class" and Uncle Matis as the "respected revolutionary veteran."

I was stunned, not knowing what to say. Sometimes I looked at Adelina's portrait with blazing eyes in the newspaper, and sometimes I looked out the window at Uncle Matis teaching female workers bayonet practice in the distant field. My heart surged with emotion, and I could not find more beautiful words to express my boundless respect for the heroic Albanian people.
