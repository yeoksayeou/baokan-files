Heroic Nation, Heroic People

On the heroic land of Albania, wherever you go, you will hear many inspiring stories of heroes. When you live among a people brimming with revolutionary heroism and patriotism, inspired by the brilliant deeds of countless heroes, you will further understand the profound significance of the great leader Chairman Mao's words: "Heroic Albania, a great beacon of socialism in Europe." Whenever I chat with enthusiastic Albanian comrades, they always passionately introduce to me the story of Adam Reka, who sacrificed his life to defend socialist property at the port of Durres, the fearless spirit of Mehamed Hyshu and Milbejza Kepi, who fought against the flames at the Linas oil mine for the people, and the moving deeds of Skuta Vata and her daughter at the Logjcën-Fieri railway construction site.

Once, a worker comrade from the "Mihal Duri" Printing Factory told me: "Since the revolutionary movement, there have been so many heroes! Our factory's model custodian, the famous revolutionary veteran Uncle Matis, is a truly remarkable figure. Everyone in Tirana knows about him!"

One day, accompanied by Comrade Bulqiza, I came to the factory warehouse. As soon as I entered, a white-haired old man in his fifties, smiling warmly, greeted me from beside the stack of paper. "Ah! Isn't this the old man I met the other day in the wilderness near the factory, who personally taught a little girl how to shoot a gun?" I joyfully shook the old man's hand. After Comrade Bulqiza introduced him, I learned that he was indeed the "respected revolutionary veteran" and model custodian, Uncle Matis, whom the worker comrades praised.

The old man led me to the office and even brewed a cup of Chinese green tea for me. He was a very talkative old man. Originally, I had asked him to share his own deeds, but he always steered the conversation elsewhere.

"Young man! I have nothing much to say about myself. Let's talk about the revolutionary heroism of the Albanian people!" The old man took a deep puff of his cigarette, paused for a moment, and then began to speak with great emotion:

"In the socialist spring garden of our country, so many brilliant revolutionary flowers have bloomed! These flowers are nurtured by the Party of Labor and Comrade Enver Hoxha. They bloom on every front of building the motherland, defending the motherland, and the revolutionary movement. Names like Reka and Skuta are already famous nationwide; you will know about them even if I don't mention them. Now, let me tell you about the heroic deeds of the soldier Marashi and the agricultural cooperative member Bajdimi!"

Matis continued: "Marashi grew up in the rugged mountains and has worked in the ranks of the working class for many years. The life of the working class has instilled in him a high sense of collectivism. Later, he became a soldier of the people's army, fearlessly overcoming difficulties and hardships, and growing stronger in the intense life of battle.

"Bajdimi is an outstanding member of the Banaja Agricultural Cooperative near Fier. He treats the local garrison as his own family and has formed a brotherly bond with Marashi.

"One day, an order came to Marashi and Bajdimi to carry out an important mission together. In our Albania, the military and the people are one family. Although Bajdimi is a member of the agricultural cooperative, he can also shoot a gun. When it comes to carrying out missions, he is just as capable as a soldier. The platoon leader said to everyone: 'Comrades! From today, we will undergo several days of military training to complete an important task: to blow up a fortress just like in real combat. To successfully complete this task, we need explosives experts. Who is willing to go?'

"The platoon leader's words were not yet finished when everyone shouted in unison: 'Me! Me!' Among these people were Marashi and Bajdimi.

"For several days of military training, the explosives experts encountered many difficulties. Their shared revolutionary ideals deepened their brotherly combat friendship.

"In the dead of night, a fierce wind swept through the wilderness, followed by a torrential downpour. It was a rare night of storm and rain. The wind uprooted corn stalks, and even some trees were uprooted. The platoon leader ordered everyone: 'Comrades! There is a livestock pen over there. Let's go in and take shelter from the rain!' The explosives experts, upon hearing the order, immediately ran towards the livestock pen. Comrades huddled together for warmth and rest. When the rain stopped, the soldiers returned to the small river where they were to carry out their mission. At this time, everyone noticed that someone was standing motionless in the field. It was Marashi. The rain had soaked his military coat. Everyone asked him: 'Why didn't you come with us to take shelter from the rain?' Marashi replied naturally and honestly: 'There are many materials here that need to be guarded.' Comrades looked at him with admiration and praised: 'Marashi is great, he is always our good example!'

"At dawn, the sound of cannon fire rumbled in the distance, smoke and dust filled the air. Tanks and infantry launched an attack on the 'enemy' positions. The explosives experts were all sweating profusely. After a night of intense battle, they rested briefly in the field to recover from fatigue, as new battle tasks awaited them. Soon, the explosives team leader issued an order to complete the explosives mission ahead of schedule.

"The platoon leader was an experienced old soldier. He knew that to complete such a task, the explosives force needed to be significantly increased. However, the number of people was limited, and others could not help. The platoon leader had developed a habit: whenever he encountered difficulties, he would always recall the guerrilla life of the war years. He called the explosives experts together and spoke.

"The platoon leader's speech aroused the soldiers' determination to overcome difficulties. After hearing the platoon leader's words, Marashi's enthusiasm soared, and he jumped up like a soldier charging towards the enemy in the trenches, shouting: 'We are glorious soldiers nurtured by the Party of Labor. There is no difficulty we cannot overcome!' 'Firmly complete the mission, do not leave the battlefield until the mission is accomplished!' Everyone responded enthusiastically. However, only Bajdimi was frowning, with his head down, lost in thought, because the platoon leader had already informed him not to participate in this battle but to stand guard. Bajdimi had always regarded standing guard as a glorious duty, but on this night, he had another idea: everyone was going to participate in this glorious and arduous explosives mission. An Albanian youth league member should go to the most difficult battle position! He requested the platoon leader, insisting on fighting alongside his comrades. The platoon leader knew this young man's stubbornness and immediately decided to let him participate in the battle with Marashi."

Matis paused for a moment and then continued: "Like other explosives experts, Bajdimi and Marashi made all the preparations. At the platoon leader's command, the two young men leaped forward and ran towards their designated battle positions. 'You pass me the explosives, and I'll light the fuse!' Marashi said. Bajdimi followed his instructions, passing him packet after packet of explosives. Marashi lit the explosives, but because of the speed, one packet of explosives was lit and not pushed out in time. When Bajdimi discovered this packet of explosives, the fuse was almost burned out. In this critical moment, Bajdimi's mind flashed with only one thought: firmly push the explosives packet out and definitely save Marashi. He did not consider his own safety at all, with the composure and calmness characteristic of a revolutionary soldier, thinking about what he had to do. He did not tell Marashi about the impending danger because he knew that if he told Marashi, this soldier who loved the people would sacrifice himself to save him.

"The fuse was about to burn out, and a disaster was about to occur. In these precious seconds, the outstanding member of the agricultural cooperative, Bajdimi, with his eyes shining with heroic light, bravely and accurately hugged the explosives packet and threw it far away. A loud explosion echoed, and Bajdimi felt his hands trembling, his vision blurring, and stars dancing before his eyes. He struggled to stand for a moment before collapsing, and then he knew nothing more. When he woke up in a room, the first thing he asked was: 'Where am I? Where is my gun?' The platoon leader nodded repeatedly, signaling Bajdimi to rest quietly. Bajdimi grabbed the platoon leader's hand and said: 'There is something I need to tell the platoon leader. My gun and gas mask are forgotten in the grass. Please forgive me for not...' The platoon leader walked to Bajdimi's side, carefully examining the face of this wounded soldier, and thought to himself: 'Where do our people draw such great strength from? Bajdimi, to save his comrade, lost both his eyes, yet he still worries about his gun. Respected Party of Labor! You have nurtured tens of thousands of such heroes. Glory belongs to you!'

Matis lit another cigarette and stared intently at the girls on the street, who were marching proudly to the shooting range.

"Uncle Matis, Bajdimi's father must be an old guerrilla fighter, right?" I asked with great respect.

The old man extinguished his cigarette and proudly continued: "Of course! Bajdimi's father, Nazepi, like Skuta's father, upon hearing the news of his son's injury, not only did not shed tears but felt immense pride for the Party and the great leader Comrade Enver Hoxha. In our Albania, those who sacrifice for the motherland will never die. They will forever live in the hearts of the people nationwide. Villagers told Nazepi about Bajdimi's injury, and the old man proudly said: 'Well done! My Bajdimi! Only a hero can be injured like this!'

Uncle Matis's words deeply moved us. Comrade Bulqiza, sitting next to me, sighed: "This is the true spirit of our brave mountain people. Under the nourishment of the Party of Labor, how many new heroes like Marashi, Bajdimi, and their fathers emerge every day!" Comrade Bulqiza's words immediately reminded me of the enthusiastic praise of Uncle Matis by the printing factory workers. I once again invited the old man to share his revolutionary family, but he refused, saying: "My family is an ordinary Albanian worker's family. What little we have done is far from meeting the Party's expectations for us." The old man's humble and simple words aroused even greater respect for him in me. Just as we were having a heated conversation, three fully armed female workers suddenly burst in. A tall girl smiled and said to Uncle Matis: "All the soldiers in our company have lined up, requesting you to teach them bayonet practice!" The old man, upon hearing the words, quickly stood up and said: "I'll go!" Then he turned to me and said: "Look! Our Albanian people are always ready with their guns against the enemy!" Saying this, he kissed me and strode out.

I and Comrade Bulqiza saw the old man off to the door. I was still unsatisfied with not hearing the old man's advanced deeds. Suddenly, I noticed a newspaper under a glass plate on the corner of the table with a portrait of a female comrade. Curiously, I asked Comrade Bulqiza who was in the picture. She took the newspaper from under the glass plate and exclaimed: "Ah! This is Uncle Matis's heroic daughter. Not long ago, all the newspapers reported their advanced deeds!" I took the newspaper, tears of excitement welling up, and read it in one breath.

It turned out that Uncle Matis had a seventeen-year-old daughter named Adelina. She was a worker at the "Enver Hoxha" Factory in Tirana. To respond to the Party of Labor's call, she actively volunteered to build the Tirana-Saranda highway. On the construction site, she displayed boundless revolutionary enthusiasm and was repeatedly awarded the honorable title of labor hero. She organized young people to propagate the Party's various policies for further promoting the revolutionary movement. Once, she fell seriously ill but did not rest. The doctor advised her to go to Tirana for treatment, but she firmly refused, saying: "I came to participate in voluntary labor, not to stay in the hospital to recuperate!" The next day, while blasting a huge rock on a mountain, she bravely sacrificed herself to protect her comrades.

After Adelina's death, Uncle Matis did not shed tears. Instead, he voluntarily requested to take over his daughter's work on the construction site. The heroic deeds spread like lightning across Albania. People rushed to write to newspapers and radio stations, praising Adelina as the "good daughter of the working class" and Uncle Matis as the "respected revolutionary veteran."

I was stunned, not knowing what to say. Sometimes I looked at Adelina's portrait with blazing eyes in the newspaper, and sometimes I looked out the window at Uncle Matis teaching female workers bayonet practice in the distant field. My heart surged with emotion, and I could not find more beautiful words to express my boundless respect for the heroic Albanian people.

### 英雄的国家　英雄的人民

　　英雄的国家　英雄的人民
    在英雄的阿尔巴尼亚国土上，不论你走到哪里，都会听到许多激动人心的英雄故事。当你生活在洋溢着革命英雄主义和爱国主义精神的人民中间，受到千千万万英雄的光辉事迹鼓舞的时候，你就会进一步体会到，伟大领袖毛主席所指出的“英雄的人民的阿尔巴尼亚，成为欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯”这句话，具有何等深远的意义啊！每当我和热情的阿尔巴尼亚同志攀谈起来的时候，他们总是满怀激情地向我介绍都拉斯海港为保卫社会主义财产英勇牺牲的亚当·雷卡的故事，里纳斯油矿与烈火搏斗、为人民献出宝贵生命的默哈迈德·希胡、米尔带札·凯皮的大无畏精神，洛格齐恩—费里铁路建设工地上斯库塔·瓦塔父女的动人事迹。
    有一次“米哈尔·杜里”印刷厂工人同志向我说：“革命化运动以来，英雄人物可多啦！我们厂的模范保管员，有名的革命老前辈玛蒂斯大叔就是一个很了不起的人物，全地拉那没有不知道他的！”
    一天，我在布谷丽同志的陪同下，来到了印刷厂仓库。一进门，一位五十出头的白发老人笑容满面地从纸垛旁边迎上来。“呀！这不是我前天在工厂附近的旷野里遇到的那位亲自教小女孩打枪的老人吗？”我惊喜地握着老人的手，经过布谷丽同志的介绍，得知原来他就是工人同志们赞颂的“可敬的革命老人”、模范保管员玛蒂斯大叔。
    老人把我让到办公室，还给我泡了一杯中国绿茶。这是一位十分健谈的老人。本来我是请求他讲述自己的事迹的，可是他总是把话题转到别处去。
    “小伙子！我个人没有什么好讲的，还是讲讲我们阿尔巴尼亚人民的革命英雄主义精神吧！”老人深深地吸了一口烟，想了一会儿，然后便异常激动地讲起来了：
      “在我国社会主义春天的大花园里，开放出多少鲜艳的革命之花啊！这些花是劳动党和霍查同志亲手培育的，这些花盛开在建设祖国、保卫祖国、革命化运动的各条战线上。雷卡、斯库塔这些名字早已闻名全国，我不讲你也会知道的。现在我给你讲讲人民军战士玛拉希和农业社社员巴依底姆的英雄事迹吧！”
    玛蒂斯接着说：“玛拉希是在丛山峻岭中长大的，在工人阶级的队伍里工作了好多年，工人阶级的生活，使他养成了高度的集体主义精神。后来当了人民军战士，他不惧艰难险阻，在紧张的战斗生活中锻炼成长。
    “巴依底姆是发罗拉附近巴纳亚农业社的优秀社员，他把当地驻军看作自己的亲人，与玛拉希结成了兄弟。
      “一天，传来命令，要玛拉希与巴依底姆一起去执行重要任务。在我们阿尔巴尼亚，军民一家不可分，别看巴依底姆是农业社社员，同样会打枪，执行起任务来，就跟战士一样。连长对大家讲：‘同志们！从今天起，我们要进行几天军事训练，完成一项重要任务：象战斗中真的爆破那样，炸毁堡垒，为了胜利完成此项任务，最重要的是需要有爆破员，谁愿意去啊？’连长的话还未讲完，人们就异口同声地喊起来：‘我！…我！…’在这些人中间就有玛拉希和巴依底姆两个人。
      “连续几天的军训中，爆破员遇到了不少困难。共同的革命理想使他们结下的兄弟般的战斗友谊更加深厚了。
      “深夜，旷野里卷起了大风，紧接着滂沱的大雨，这是一个罕见的暴风雨之夜。狂风刮断了玉米秆子，甚至有的树木也都连根拔起了。连长对大家发出命令：‘同志们！那边有一个牲口圈，我们一起进去躲躲雨吧！’爆破员听到命令，立刻向牲口圈跑去，战友们互相依偎着取暖休息。当雨停下来的时候，战士们又回到执行任务的小河旁。这时候，同志们发现一个人一动也不动地站在田野里，他就是玛拉希。雨水把他的军用大衣全淋透了。大家问他：‘你为什么不跟我们一起去避雨啊？’玛拉希自然憨厚地回答：‘这里有很多材料，需要人看守。’同志们向他投去热情赞佩的目光，夸奖道：‘玛拉希就是棒，任何时候都是我们的好榜样！’
    “清晨，远处传来隆隆的响声，炮火连天，烟尘弥漫。坦克、步兵一起向‘敌人’的阵地发起攻击。爆破员们个个汗流满面，经过一夜的紧张战斗之后，在田野稍停片刻，恢复疲劳，因为新的战斗任务正在等待他们完成。不大一会儿，爆破员负责人发出命令，要提前完成爆破任务。
    “连长是一个具有丰富经验的老战士，他知道，完成这样的任务，需要大大增加爆破力量。但是人数有限，别的人是帮不上忙的。连长已经养成了这样的习惯：每当遇到困难的时候，总是回忆起战争年代游击队员的战斗生活。他把爆破员召集到一起讲话。
    “连长的讲话唤起了战士们战胜困难的决心，玛拉希听了连长的话之后，干劲倍增，就象当年战壕里向敌人冲锋的战士那样，高跳起来说：‘我们是光荣的劳动党抚育的战士，没有克服不了的困难！’‘坚决完成任务，完不成任务不下火线！’人们七嘴八舌地响应道。不过，唯有巴依底姆一个人愁眉不展，低着头，想心事，因为连长早已通知不要他参加这次战斗，而让他去站岗值勤。巴依底姆一向把站岗值勤看作是光荣的职责，可是这天夜里，他却有另外一种想法：大家都要去参加这项光荣而又艰巨的爆破任务，一个阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟的成员，应该到最困难的战斗岗位上去！他向连长提出请求，坚决和同志们一起参加战斗。连长很了解这个小伙子的犟劲，立刻决定让他和玛拉希一起参加战斗。”
    玛蒂斯大叔停了一会儿又说：“象其他爆破员一样，巴依底姆和玛拉希二人做好了一切准备，连长一声令下，两个小伙子就一跃而去，跑向指定的战斗岗位。‘你给我递炸药，我来点火！’玛拉希讲道。巴依底姆听从他的吩咐，把一包包炸药递到玛拉希手中，玛拉希把炸药点燃，可是由于速度太快，有一包炸药点燃后来不及推出去了。当巴依底姆发现这包炸药时，导火线已经差不多快烧完了。在这千钧一发的时刻，巴依底姆的脑海里只闪过一个念头：坚决要把炸药包推出去，一定要舍身救玛拉希脱险。他根本没有考虑个人生命的安危，以革命战士所特有的沉着和冷静，思考着所要做的一切。他没有把将要发生的危险告诉玛拉希，因为他知道，如果告诉玛拉希，这个一心爱民的战士反倒会舍身救他。
      “导火线眼看就要烧尽，一场灾祸马上就要发生，在这宝贵的几秒钟里，优秀的农业社社员巴依底姆两眼闪烁着英雄的光芒，神勇而准确地抱起炸药包向远处抛去。轰隆一声巨响，炸药包爆炸了，巴依底姆只觉得双手颤抖，天昏地暗，金花乱窜，他竭尽全力站了一会儿，就倒了下去，随后就什么都不知道了。当他在一所房间里醒来的时候，首先问道：‘我是在哪里啊？我的枪在什么地方？’连长连连点头，示意巴依底姆安静休息。巴依底姆抓住连长的手说：‘有一件事情要告诉连长，我的枪和防毒面具忘在草丛里啦，请原谅我没有……’连长走到巴依底姆身旁，仔细地打量着这位受伤的战士的面颊，心里暗暗地说道：‘我们的人民是从哪里吸取了这样伟大的力量啊？巴依底姆为了抢救同志，失去了一对眼睛，反倒惦记着自己的枪。敬爱的劳动党啊！培育了这样成千上万的英雄，光荣属于您啊！’”
    玛蒂斯老人重新点着一支烟，目不转睛地望着大街上打靶去的雄赳赳、气昂昂的姑娘们。
    “玛蒂斯大叔，巴依底姆的父亲一定是个老游击队员吧？”我怀着十分敬佩的心情问道。
    老人灭了烟头，自豪地继续说道：“那当然罗！巴依底姆的爸爸奈泽比象斯库塔的父亲一样，得到儿子受伤的消息，不但没有流泪，反而为党和伟大领袖霍查同志感到无比的骄傲。在我们阿尔巴尼亚，为祖国而捐躯的人，永世不会死亡，他将永远活在全国人民的心中。乡亲们把巴依底姆受伤的情况告诉奈泽比，老人自豪地讲道：‘好样的！我的巴依底姆啊！只有勇士才能这样的受伤！’”
    玛蒂斯大叔的话深深地感动了我们。坐在我旁边的布谷丽同志感叹地说：“这就是我们勇敢的山民所具有的本色。在劳动党雨露的滋润下，每天有多少象玛拉希、巴依底姆和他们的父亲这样新时代的英雄人物涌现出来啊！”布谷丽同志的话使我立刻想起印刷厂工人们热情赞扬玛蒂斯大叔的话语，我再一次邀请老人讲讲他的革命家庭，可是他怎么也不肯，只是说：“我的家是个普通的阿尔巴尼亚工人家庭，我们所做的那一点事情远远达不到党对我们的要求。”老人谦逊质朴的谈话唤起了我对他更大的敬意。正在我们热烈地交谈时，突然闯进来三位全副武装的女工人，其中一个高个子姑娘笑呵呵地对玛蒂斯大叔说：“我们全连战士已排好队伍，恳求您去教她们练习刺杀！”老人听罢讲话，赶忙站起来说：“我就去！”然后转过身来对我讲：“瞧！我们阿尔巴尼亚人民对待敌人，任何时候都备好了枪弹！”说着亲吻了我一下就大步地走出去了。
    我和布谷丽同志把老人送到门口，我总为没有听到老人家的先进事迹感到不太满足。突然我发现桌子一角的一块玻璃板下面有一张画有一个女同志头像的报纸，我好奇地问布谷丽同志报上画的是谁，她把报纸从玻璃板下取了出来，惊喜地喊道：“呀！这就是玛蒂斯大叔的英雄女儿，不久前，各家报纸都登了他们父女俩的先进事迹！”我接过报纸含着激动的热泪，一口气把它读完了。
    原来事情是这样的：玛蒂斯大叔有个十七岁的女儿，名叫阿黛丽娜，她是地拉那“恩维尔·霍查”工厂的工人，为了响应劳动党的号召，她积极报名参加修筑地拉那—申巴里公路。在工地上，她发挥了冲天的革命干劲，多次荣获劳动突击手的光荣称号。她组织青年到处宣传劳动党关于进一步开展革命化运动的各项政策。有一次她得了重病也不休息，医生叫她到地拉那医治，她坚决地拒绝了，说道：“我是来参加义务劳动的，不是来住医院养身体的！”第二天，在爆破一座山头的巨型岩石时，为了掩护同志，英勇地牺牲了。
    阿黛丽娜死后，玛蒂斯大叔并没有流泪，相反却主动要求到工地接女儿的班。英雄的事迹象闪电一样传遍了阿尔巴尼亚，人们纷纷给报纸、电台写信，称阿黛丽娜为“工人阶级的好女儿”，称玛蒂斯大叔为“可敬的革命老人”。
    我呆了，不知说什么才好，一会儿看看报纸上阿黛丽娜目光灼灼的画像，一会儿通过窗户望望玛蒂斯大叔在远处的田野手持刺刀教女工人练刺杀的雄姿，我心潮澎湃，简直找不到更美好的语言表达我对英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民的无限敬意。
