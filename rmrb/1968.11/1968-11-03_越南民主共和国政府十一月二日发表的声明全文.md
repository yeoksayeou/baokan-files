The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the Unconditional Cessation by the U.S. Government of Bombing and Attacks on the Entire Territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam

For fourteen years, the United States has ignored its commitments under the Geneva Agreements on the Vietnam issue, continuously interfering with and invading our South, aiming to turn the South into a new type of U.S. colony and military base, and to permanently divide Vietnam. Since early 1965, the United States has dispatched its expeditionary forces and their mercenaries to intensify the war of aggression in the South, while using its air and naval forces to bomb and attack the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, in a vain attempt to rescue its failing situation in the South and to force the Vietnamese people to surrender.

Under the wise leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the people of the South have fought bravely and heroically, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy and achieving ever-greater victories. Especially since the general offensive and uprising in the spring of 1968, U.S. imperialism has been forced into a passive defensive position, and the puppet regime and puppet army have become increasingly shaky and weak.

The people of the North have fought bravely, resisting U.S. imperialism's destructive war, preventing it from achieving its war objectives, and suffering extremely heavy losses, with over 3,200 modern aircraft shot down. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam, under wartime conditions, has continued to grow stronger, with its economic and military strength continually increasing, and national unity reaching unprecedented levels.

The socialist brother countries, the people of the world who love peace, and the progressive people of the United States all stand on the side of justice, firmly supporting the Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression, further isolating U.S. imperialism.

Facing the hopeless situation in Vietnam and the severe difficulties caused by the Vietnam War, under the pressure of world and U.S. public opinion, the U.S. government was forced to announce the complete cessation of air, naval, and artillery bombing and attacks on the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

Over four years, the U.S. has committed heinous crimes against the people of North Vietnam, and after causing the Paris talks to stall for the past five months, it was forced to unconditionally stop bombing and attacking the entire territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This marks a great victory for the people of North and South Vietnam. It is also a great victory for the socialist camp, the national liberation movement, and the peace movement, and for the people of the world, including the progressive people of the United States.

After the U.S. unconditionally stops bombing and attacking the entire territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will discuss with the U.S. side "other issues related to both sides" to seek a political solution to the Vietnam issue. In agreement with the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam announces its readiness at any time to participate in a conference including representatives of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the United States, and the Saigon regime. The participation of the Saigon regime in this conference does not mean that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam side recognizes this regime.

The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is the organizer and leader of the South Vietnamese people's struggle against the U.S. and for national salvation, having liberated four-fifths of the South's land with a population of over 10 million, possessing a powerful armed force, and enjoying high prestige both domestically and internationally. The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is the true representative of the South Vietnamese people and has the right to resolve all issues related to South Vietnam.

The current Saigon regime is obviously a tool used by U.S. imperialist aggressors to implement neocolonialism in South Vietnam. This regime goes against all the legitimate wishes of the South Vietnamese people. This regime represents no one.

The Vietnamese people's stance on resolving the Vietnam issue is the four-point proposal of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the political program of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. This is a stance of independence and peace in accordance with the basic principles of the 1954 Geneva Agreements on the Vietnam issue. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people firmly demand that the United States must stop the war of aggression against Vietnam, must permanently abandon all actions that infringe upon the sovereignty and security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people firmly demand that the United States must withdraw all U.S. troops and mercenaries from South Vietnam, dismantle all U.S. military bases in the South, and allow the South Vietnamese people to resolve their internal affairs without foreign interference, in accordance with the political program of the National Liberation Front.

To seek a correct political solution to the Vietnam issue, the U.S. government must abandon all its schemes of interference and aggression against Vietnam, and must respect the basic national rights of the Vietnamese people. As long as the United States continues to invade Vietnam, the Vietnamese people will fight until they achieve complete victory.

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam warmly praises all our compatriots for their unity, solidarity, and heroic struggle, and for the glorious victories they have achieved. The U.S. being forced to unconditionally stop bombing and attacking the entire territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is a great victory, but it is only an initial victory in our people's struggle against the U.S. and for national salvation. The more U.S. imperialism fails, the more cunning and vicious it becomes. It still threatens the North, still intensifies its aggression in the South, and continues to commit more crimes against the people of the South. All the Vietnamese people are determined to strengthen unity, heighten vigilance, be ready to overcome all difficulties, and make every sacrifice to thoroughly implement the call for a decisive battle and victory by President Ho Chi Minh and the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, to liberate the South, defend the North, and move towards the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, and to contribute to the maintenance of peace in Asia and the world.

The people of the North must uphold the glorious fighting traditions, be ready at any time to foil all the schemes of U.S. imperialism against the North, and strive to fulfill the duties of the rear to the front, so as not to be unworthy of the revolutionary base of the entire nation.

The heroic people of the South must uphold the advantages of the general offensive and uprising, overcome all difficulties and obstacles, and resolutely achieve complete victory, building an independent, democratic, peaceful, neutral, and prosperous South Vietnam, and moving towards the peaceful reunification of the fatherland.

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam expresses deep gratitude to the socialist brother countries that have consistently supported and aided the Vietnamese people in their struggle against the U.S. and for national salvation, to the governments and peoples of countries that love peace and uphold justice, to the progressive people of the United States, and to all democratic organizations in the world.

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam calls on brothers and friends from the five continents to strengthen their support and aid to the Vietnamese people until they achieve complete victory, and to wage a resolute struggle, demanding that the United States must stop its aggression against Vietnam, must permanently abandon all actions that infringe upon the sovereignty and security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, must withdraw all U.S. troops and mercenaries from South Vietnam, dismantle all U.S. military bases in the South, and allow the South Vietnamese people to resolve their internal affairs without foreign interference, in accordance with the political program of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

The Vietnamese people will surely win!

The U.S. imperialist aggressors will surely fail!

Long live a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam!

    越南民主共和国政府十一月二日发表的声明全文
    新华社河内二日电　据越南通讯社报道，越南民主共和国政府二日发表一项声明，全文如下：
    越南民主共和国政府关于美国政府无条件地停止对越南民主共和国全部领土的轰炸和袭击的声明
    十四年来，美国无视它对关于越南问题的日内瓦协议所作的保证，连续地干涉和侵略我国南方，目的在于把南方变成美国的新型殖民地和军事基地，长期分割越南。从一九六五年年初以来，美国派遣它的远征军及其帮凶军强化侵略南方的战争，同时用空军和海军轰炸、袭击越南民主共和国，妄图挽救它在南方的失败和深陷泥潭的处境，并迫使越南人民向它屈服。
    南方同胞在越南南方民族解放阵线的英明领导下，进行了英勇卓绝的战斗，连续给予敌人以沉重的打击，取得了日益巨大的胜利，特别是自一九六八年春季的总进攻和一致奋起斗争以来，使美帝国主义深陷被动防御的处境，使伪政权和伪军更加动摇、衰弱。
    北方人民英勇战斗，抗击美帝国主义的破坏性战争，使它无法达到这场战争的目的，而且遭到了十分惨重的损失，三千二百多架现代化飞机被击落。越南民主共和国在战争条件下继续壮大，经济和军事力量不断得到增强，全民团结空前坚强。
    各社会主义兄弟国家、全世界爱好和平人民和美国进步人民都站在正义一边，坚决支持越南人民抗击美帝国主义的侵略，使美帝国主义更加孤立。
    面对在越南的无可挽救的处境，面对由越南战争所造成的严重困难，在世界舆论和美国舆论的压力下，美国政府被迫宣布完全停止空军、海军和炮兵对越南民主共和国的轰炸和袭击。
    美国在四年中对越南北方人民犯下了累累的滔天罪行，并使巴黎对话在过去五个月里陷于僵局之后，它不得不无条件地停止对越南民主共和国全部领土的轰炸和袭击，这标志着越南南、北两方人民的巨大胜利。这也是社会主义阵营、民族解放运动与和平运动的巨大胜利，是包括美国进步人民在内的全世界人民的巨大胜利。
    在美国无条件地停止对越南民主共和国全部领土的轰炸和袭击之后，越南民主共和国政府将与美国方面讨论“同双方有关的其它问题”，以便为越南问题寻求一项政治解决办法。在同越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会取得一致意见的情况下，越南民主共和国政府宣布随时准备参加包括越南民主共和国代表、越南南方民族解放阵线代表、美国代表和西贡政权代表的会议。西贡政权代表参加这次会议，并不意味着越南民主共和国方面承认这个政权。
    越南南方民族解放阵线是越南南方人民抗美救国的组织者和领导者，已经解放了拥有一千多万人口的南方五分之四的土地，拥有强大的武装力量，在国内外享有很高的威信。越南南方民族解放阵线是越南南方人民的真正代表，有权解决同越南南方有关的一切问题。
    现在的西贡政权，显然是美帝国主义侵略者用以在越南南方实现新殖民主义的工具。这个政权违背南方人民的一切正当愿望。这个政权代表不了任何人。
    越南人民解决越南问题的立场，是越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的政治纲领。这是符合一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议基本原则的独立与和平的立场。越南民主共和国政府和越南人民坚决要求美国必须停止侵略越南的战争，必须永远放弃侵犯越南民主共和国的主权和安全的一切行动。越南民主共和国政府和越南人民坚决要求美国必须把美军及其帮凶军全部撤出越南南方，撤除美国在南方的一切军事基地，让南方人民在没有外国干涉的情况下，按照南方民族解放阵线的政治纲领自己解决自己的内部事务。
    为了寻求一个关于越南问题的正确的政治解决办法，美国政府必须放弃对越南的一切干涉和侵略阴谋，必须尊重越南人民的各项基本民族权利。只要美国还侵略越南，越南人民就要进行战斗，直到取得彻底胜利。
    越南民主共和国政府热烈表彰我全国同胞团结一致，万众一心，进行无比英勇的战斗和所取得的辉煌胜利。美国被迫无条件地停止对越南民主共和国全部领土的轰炸和袭击，是一个巨大胜利，但仅仅是我国全体人民在抗美救国事业中的初步胜利。美帝国主义越失败就越凶恶和狡猾。它仍然威胁北方，仍然加紧侵略南方，不断地对南方同胞犯下更多的罪行。全体越南人民决心加强团结，提高警惕，随时准备克服一切困难，不惜一切牺牲，彻底实现胡主席和越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会的决战决胜的号召，解放南方，保卫北方，进而和平统一祖国，为维护亚洲和世界和平作出贡献。
    北方军民要发扬光荣的战斗传统，随时准备粉碎美帝国主义对北方的一切阴谋，努力完成大后方对大前线的义务，以不愧为全国的革命根据地。
    英雄的南方同胞要发扬总进攻和奋起斗争时期的胜利优势，克服一切困难和阻碍，坚决夺取彻底的胜利，建设独立、民主、和平、中立和繁荣的越南南方，进而和平统一祖国。
    越南民主共和国政府对一贯支持和援助越南人民抗美救国的各社会主义兄弟国家，爱好和平与主持公理的各国政府和人民，美国进步人民以及世界上各民主组织表示深切的感谢。
    越南民主共和国政府呼吁五大洲的兄弟和朋友加强对越南人民的支持和援助，直到取得彻底胜利，并且进行坚决斗争，要求美国必须停止对越南的侵略，必须永远放弃侵犯越南民主共和国的主权和安全的一切行动，必须把美军及其帮凶军全部撤出越南南方，撤除美国在南方的一切军事基地，让南方人民在没有外国干涉的情况下，按照越南南方民族解放阵线的政治纲领自己解决自己的内部事务。
    越南人民必胜！
    美帝国主义侵略者必败！
    和平、统一、独立、民主和富强的越南万岁！
                          一九六八年十一月二日
