"The Theory of Intra-Party Peace" is a Shield for Class Enemies

Liu Shaoqi, in order to cover up his crimes as a traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader, spread the "theory of intra-party peace." He maliciously attacked comrades who insisted on intra-party struggle, calling them "absolutists of Lenin's principles" and "deniers of intra-party peace."

Marxism-Leninism holds that all things in the world have contradictions and struggle, and develop through contradictions and struggle. The Communist Party, as a tool of class struggle, has also grown and strengthened through struggle. "If there are no contradictions and no struggle to resolve contradictions within the party, the party's life would come to a halt."

Chairman Mao deeply pointed out: "The contradiction between correct and incorrect ideas within the Communist Party... is a reflection of class contradictions within the party as long as classes exist." As long as class struggle exists, the struggle between the two lines within the party will never cease. So-called "intra-party peace" is nothing but a deception!

Qingdao Vehicle Section has long been under the rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang, making it a place where all sorts of elements mix. After liberation, under the protection of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, some Kuomintang secret agents and key members infiltrated the party, some even holding important positions. During political movements, they protected each other and passed through unscathed. Whenever there was a hint of trouble, they would stir up trouble, engaging in anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought activities. Many old workers saw these ghosts and demons in power and were furious. Many worker party members fought resolutely against them. This small group of bad elements picked up Liu Shaoqi's "theory of intra-party peace," deceiving party members and saying that this was a matter of understanding and methods of handling issues, that everyone makes mistakes. They threatened workers, saying that opposing them was opposing the party and the revolution! They used the "theory of intra-party peace" to protect themselves. Once party members and revolutionary masses fought against them, touching the interests of these Kuomintang remnants, they would engage in naked class revenge. In the early days of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a party member stood firmly on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line and resolutely fought against their implementation of the bourgeois reactionary line and their savage suppression of the masses. This time, they stirred up a hornet's nest, immediately labeling him as "inciting the masses against the party committee" and branding him as a "counter-revolutionary"!

The struggle between the two lines within the party is not subject to human will. Whoever does not acknowledge this is not a true Communist Party member. Liu Shaoqi's "theory of intra-party peace" is, in essence, allowing traitors, spies, and Kuomintang remnants who have infiltrated the party to impose bourgeois dictatorship on the proletariat, while not allowing the proletariat to strike back. It is to use the "theory of intra-party peace" to lull party members into complacency and protect class enemies.

Great Leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Even a proletarian party needs to expel the old and take in the new to stay vigorous. Without cleaning out the dross and absorbing fresh blood, the party will lose its vigor." The process of expelling the old and taking in the new is the process of intra-party struggle. Together with the revolutionary masses, the party members of our vehicle section used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to severely criticize the "theory of intra-party peace," and resolutely fought against a small group of class enemies, exposing the traitors and Kuomintang secret agents who had hidden within the party for many years. The intense class struggle practice made everyone deeply realize that there is no peace within the party, and we must maintain high revolutionary vigilance, never stopping the struggle against all fallacies and heresies that do not conform to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Through struggle, we expel the old and take in the new, building our party into a vigorous vanguard organization that can lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses in the struggle against class enemies.

### “党内和平论”是阶级敌人的保护伞

　　“党内和平论”是阶级敌人的保护伞
　　柳齐
    刘少奇为了掩盖他叛徒、内奸、工贼的罪恶行径，就散布“党内和平论”。他恶毒地攻击坚持党内斗争的同志是：“把列宁的原则绝对化”，是“否定了党内和平”。
    马列主义认为，世界上一切事物都存在着矛盾和斗争，在矛盾和斗争中发展。作为阶级斗争工具的共产党，也是在斗争中发展壮大起来的，“党内如果没有矛盾和解决矛盾的思想斗争，党的生命也就停止了。”
    毛主席深刻指出：“共产党内正确思想和错误思想的矛盾，……在阶级存在的时候，这是阶级矛盾对于党内的反映。”只要有阶级斗争存在，党内两条路线的斗争就一天不会止息。所谓“党内和平”，只能是一种欺骗！
    青岛车辆段受过帝国主义和国民党的长期统治，是鱼龙混杂之地。解放后，在刘少奇反革命修正主义路线的包庇下，一些蒋匪中统特务、国民党骨干分子混入党内，有的窃踞了党内重要职务。他们在历次政治运动中，互相包庇，蒙混过关。一有风吹草动，他们就跳出来兴风作浪，进行反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的活动。许多老工人看到这些牛鬼蛇神当道，肺都要气炸了。许多工人共产党员和他们进行了坚决的斗争。这一小撮坏家伙拣起了刘少奇“党内和平论”的破烂，蒙蔽党员，胡说这是认识问题，是处理问题的方法问题，谁还没有点错误？并恶狠狠地威胁工人，说反对他们就是反党，就是反革命！他们用“党内和平论”把自己包庇起来。一旦共产党员和革命群众向他们作斗争，触及这一小撮国民党残渣余孽的利益的时候，他们就进行赤裸裸的阶级报复。无产阶级文化大革命初期，有一个共产党员坚决站在无产阶级革命路线一边，对他们执行资产阶级反动路线、疯狂镇压群众的反革命行为进行了坚决的斗争，把斗争的矛头对准了走资派，这一下，可捅了马蜂窝，立即被他们扣上“煽动群众，反对党委”的帽子，被打成“反革命”！
    党内两条路线的斗争是不以人的意志为转移的。谁不承认这点，谁就不是一个真正的共产党员。刘少奇的“党内和平论”，说穿了就是让钻进党内的叛徒、特务、国民党残渣余孽对无产阶级实行资产阶级专政，而不允许无产阶级有丝毫反击，就是要用“党内和平论”麻痹党员斗志，把阶级敌人保护起来。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“一个无产阶级的党也要吐故纳新，才能朝气蓬勃。不清除废料，不吸收新鲜血液，党就没有朝气。”吐故纳新的过程，就是党内斗争的过程。我们车辆段的共产党员和革命群众一起，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想狠狠批判了“党内和平论”，向一小撮阶级敌人作了坚决的斗争，把隐藏在党内多年的出卖我党员多人的叛徒、国民党中统特务揪了出来。激烈的阶级斗争的实践使大家深深认识到党内并不和平，必须保持高度革命警惕，永不停息地向一切不符合毛主席革命路线的谬论邪说作斗争，在斗争中吐故纳新，把我党建设成能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。
