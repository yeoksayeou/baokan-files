The people's armed struggle led by the Communist Party of Thailand is rapidly developing in the northern, northeastern, and southern regions. The local people's armed forces are employing the strategy and tactics of people's war, repeatedly smashing the enemy's counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression," growing and strengthening their own forces, and increasingly taking the initiative to strike the enemy.

Currently, the flames of the people's armed struggle in northern Thailand have spread to six provinces: Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Phrae, Nan, Phetchabun, and Phitsanulok. In Chiang Mai, since the end of last year until the beginning of this year, the enemy mobilized eight fully armed reinforced battalions, using various brutal methods to massacre the people and destroy their property. However, the enemy could not defeat the people's armed forces. Instead, they were met with brave and resolute counterattacks by the people's armed forces using the strategy and tactics of people's war, resulting in hundreds of enemy casualties. After the people in Chiang Rai launched armed struggles in the Thoeng district in May last year, the enemy launched savage suppression, attempting to eliminate the people's armed forces from the outset. The people's armed forces, in their struggle against the enemy's suppression, have grown and strengthened, and are now heavily striking the enemy in five districts. Since March this year, the people's armed forces in Phrae's Pong district have engaged in fifteen battles with the military and police of the Thanom–Praphas forces, killing and wounding many enemies. The people's armed forces have also infiltrated enemy airfields to attack helicopters.

In the northeastern region, the people's armed forces in Nakhon Phanom province flexibly employ Chairman Mao's strategy and tactics of people's war, dividing their forces to mobilize and organize the masses, and concentrating their forces to strike the enemy. In their work to mobilize and organize the masses, they mainly send armed propaganda teams to various villages. According to preliminary statistics, from the beginning of this year to October, the people's armed forces in Nakhon Phanom province have sent out armed propaganda teams twenty times. In their work, the people's armed forces fear no difficulties, helping the broad masses of peasants raise their political consciousness, distinguish between enemies and friends, and fight to rid themselves of American imperialist oppression, exploitation, and occupation. Recently, the U.S.-Thanom regime has continuously sent military and police to "sweep" the people's armed forces in Sa Kaeo province, but they have been met with brave counterattacks. According to preliminary statistics, from October 28 to November 3, the people's armed forces in Sa Kaeo's Wang Sam Mo district have consecutively defeated three enemy attacks. At the same time, the people's armed forces launched three night attacks on the enemy, killing and wounding many enemy soldiers. In addition, the people's armed forces, together with the local masses, executed a notorious spy from the U.S.-Thanom regime.

In southern Thailand, the people's armed struggle in Pattani province has expanded to three districts. Since this year, the people's armed forces in Pattani province have engaged in approximately twenty battles with the military and police of the U.S.-Thanom regime. According to the regime's own admissions, more than fifteen reactionary military and police have been killed and wounded. The people's armed forces have also sent armed propaganda teams to various villages multiple times to mobilize and organize the masses, helping the peasants punish spies and notorious officials.

On November 6, the "Voice of the Thai People" radio station broadcasted a commentary analyzing the rapid development of the people's armed struggle in northern Thailand. The commentary stated that the people's armed struggle in Thailand is just, led by the Communist Party of Thailand, and implements the political and military lines of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. The people's armed forces are the true people's army, serving the people wholeheartedly, and receiving the wholehearted support of the people. Therefore, the U.S.-Thanom regime will never be able to suppress the people's armed forces; instead, they will be completely annihilated by the people's armed forces.

　　运用人民战争战略战术粉碎“围剿”　主动打击敌人壮大自己力量
　　人民战争烈火燃遍泰国大片地区
　　人民武装在战斗的同时派出武装宣传队深入乡村，动员和组织群众给敌人沉重打击
    新华社十三日讯　据“泰国人民之声”电台广播，泰国共产党领导的人民革命武装斗争，正在北部、东北部、南部各地迅速发展。各地人民武装运用人民战争的战略战术，一次又一次地粉碎了敌人的反革命“围剿”，发展和壮大了自己的力量，正在日益主动地打击敌人。
    现在，泰国北部人民武装斗争的烈火已经蔓延到了六个府，即难府、清莱、达府、程逸、碧差汶和彭世洛。在难府，从去年底到今年初，敌人出动了全副武装的八个加强营，采用了各种野蛮手段，残酷地屠杀人民和破坏人民的财产。但是，敌人无法战胜人民武装，相反，它们遭到人民武装用人民战争的战略战术进行的英勇果敢的反击，死伤了几百人。清莱府人民去年五月在汤县地区开展武装斗争以后，敌人曾疯狂镇压，妄图从一开始就把人民武装消灭掉。人民武装在反对敌人镇压的斗争中日益发展壮大，目前正在五个县的地区沉重地打击敌人。今年三月以来，清莱府磅县人民武装曾同他侬—巴博集团的军警作战十五次，打死打伤敌人多名。人民武装还曾潜入敌人机场袭击直升飞机。
    在东北部，那空拍侬府人民武装灵活运用毛主席关于人民战争的战略战术，分兵以动员组织群众，集中以打击敌人。他们在动员和组织群众的工作中采取的主要形式是派武装宣传队到各乡村开展工作。据初步统计，从今年初到十月份，那空拍侬府人民武装曾派出武装宣传队达二十次。人民武装在开展工作当中不怕困难，帮助广大农民提高政治觉悟，分清敌友，为摆脱美帝的压迫、剥削和占领而斗争。最近，美国—他侬集团不断派出军警对沙功那空府人民武装进行“扫荡”，遭到人民武装的英勇反击。据初步统计，从十月二十八日到十一月三日，沙功那空府沙汪铃辇县人民武装曾连续三次击败了敌人的进攻。同时，人民武装在夜间袭击敌人三次，打死打伤敌军多名。此外，人民武装还协同当地群众，处决了一个罪大恶极的美国—他侬集团的特务。
    在泰国南部，博他仑府人民的革命武装斗争，已扩展到三个县。今年以来，博他仑府人民武装曾经同美国—他侬集团的军警作战约二十次，仅就他侬集团供认的情况看，反动军警被打死打伤十五人以上。人民武装还多次派出武装宣传队到各乡村动员组织群众，帮助农民惩办特务和罪大恶极的官吏。
    “泰国人民之声”电台六日广播一篇评论，就泰国北部局势分析了人民武装斗争迅速发展的情况。评论说，泰国的人民武装斗争是正义的，是在泰国共产党领导下执行了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的政治、军事路线的人民战争。人民武装是真正的人民军队，全心全意为人民服务，并得到人民全心全意的支持。因此，美国—他侬集团永远无法把人民武装镇压下去，相反他们将被人民武装彻底消灭。
