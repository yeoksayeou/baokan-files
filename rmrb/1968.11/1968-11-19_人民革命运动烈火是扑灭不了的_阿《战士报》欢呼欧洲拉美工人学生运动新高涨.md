The fire of the people's revolutionary movement cannot be extinguished
Albanian *Warrior* newspaper hails the new upsurge of workers' and students' movements in Europe and Latin America

	NEW DELHI, Nov. 17 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian newspaper *Warrior* published a commentary on Nov. 17, enthusiastically hailing the new upsurge of workers' and students' movements in Europe and Latin America.

	The commentary said that the political and economic crises of capitalism and modern revisionism are deepening. The tide of the students' movement in Europe and Latin America is surging again, sweeping across more countries. This movement is increasingly combining with the workers' movement, constantly shaking the reactionary rule in these countries. In these countries, demonstrations, rallies, and strikes have a pronounced political character, making the ruling authorities panic. They use deception and violence to suppress the movement. However, the fire of this revolutionary movement cannot be extinguished.

	The commentary pointed out that the revolutionary tide of workers and students is surging because the working people can no longer tolerate the oppression and exploitation of the reactionary ruling class. This movement is developing because students and workers, as class struggle develops, are increasingly aware, recognizing their friends and enemies, recognizing the true face of the reactionary ruling class and revisionists, and exposing them. They are increasingly understanding that the great student movement, combined with the workers' movement, led by the working class, and guided by the invincible Marxist-Leninist ideology, can achieve complete victory.

　　人民革命运动烈火是扑灭不了的
　　阿《战士报》欢呼欧洲拉美工人学生运动新高涨
    新华社地拉那十七日电　阿尔巴尼亚《战士报》十七日发表评论，热烈欢呼欧洲和拉丁美洲各国工人和学生运动的新高涨。
    评论说，资本主义世界和现代修正主义的政治、经济的巨大危机，正在日益加深。整个欧洲和拉美各国的学生运动的浪潮重新高涨，席卷着更多的国家。这一运动正在日益紧密地同工人运动相结合，不断地动摇着这些国家的反动统治。在这些国家，示威、集会和罢工具有显著的政治性质，使这些国家的统治当局惊慌失措。他们采取欺骗手段和使用暴力进行镇压。但是这一革命运动的烈火是扑灭不了的。
    评论指出，工人和学生的革命浪潮之所以日益高涨，是由于劳动人民再也不能忍受反动统治阶级的压迫和剥削。这一运动之所以日益发展，是因为学生和工人随着阶级斗争的发展，日益提高觉悟，认清了自己的朋友和敌人，认清了反动统治阶级和修正主义者的嘴脸，正在揭穿他们。他们愈来愈懂得，伟大的学生运动同工人运动结合起来，由工人阶级领导，并在战无不胜的马克思列宁主义思想的指引下，才能取得彻底胜利。
