Egypt Shoots Down an Invading Israeli Aircraft

	New China News Agency Cairo, November 3rd

	According to a battle report issued by the Egyptian Armed Forces Command on the 3rd, the Egyptian Air Force shot down an Israeli aircraft in the skies over the Suez Canal region on the 3rd.

	The battle report stated that on the 3rd, four Israeli aircraft were intercepted and attacked by Egyptian fighter jets and anti-aircraft artillery in the skies over the Suez Canal region. One Israeli aircraft was hit, exploded in mid-air, and crashed in the Kap region east of Ismailia.

	According to an earlier official statement from Egypt, the imperialist tool of the United States, Israel, has recently repeatedly carried out military provocations against Egypt. On October 23rd, four Israeli aircraft invaded the skies over Ismailia, Egypt. The Egyptian Air Force shot down three of them and damaged one. On the 26th, Israeli forces shelled Taufiq Port and Suez City with rockets and artillery. On the 31st, an Israeli aircraft invaded the Upper Egypt region of Nag Hammadi, bombing a bridge near the town of Kanayis and damaging part of a power station in Nag Hammadi City.

	Reports from local newspapers indicate that approximately one hundred Israeli pilots and technical personnel have recently gone to U.S. Air Force bases to receive training to use the "Phantom" fighter jets that the United States is to provide to Israel. It is clear that U.S. imperialism is determined to arm Israel for further aggression against Arab countries.

    阿联击落入侵的以色列飞机一架
    新华社开罗三日电　据阿联武装部队司令部三日晚发表的战报，阿联空军三日在苏伊士运河地区上空击落了一架以色列飞机。
    战报说，三日，四架以色列飞机在苏伊士运河区上空被阿联战斗机配合高射炮部队予以截击。一架以色列飞机被击中在空中爆炸，坠于伊斯梅利亚以东的卡普地区。
    据阿联官方早些时候发表的公报，美帝国主义的侵略工具以色列最近曾一再对阿联进行军事挑衅。十月二十三日，四架以色列飞机侵入阿联伊斯梅利亚上空。阿联空军击落其中三架，打伤一架。二十六日，以色列军队用火箭和大炮轰击陶菲克港和苏伊士市。三十一日，一架以色列飞机侵入上埃及的纳格哈马迪地区，轰炸卡内克镇附近的一座桥梁，并炸坏了纳格哈马迪市的一个变电站的一部分。
    这里的报纸报道，大约一百名以色列飞行员和技术人员已在最近前往美国空军基地，接受训练，以使用美国将送交以色列的“鬼怪式”战斗机。很明显，美帝国主义决心武装以色列对阿拉伯国家进行进一步的侵略。
