A certain chemical defense platoon of the Jinan Military Region has, since 1961, taken in 15 high school graduates, of whom 14 have been rated as five-good soldiers, 13 have been admitted to the Communist Party, and 10 have become officers in the army. The young intellectuals, together with the workers and peasants, have powerfully promoted the construction of the platoon, which has consecutively been rated as a four-good platoon for seven years. Recently, in order to further carry out Chairman Mao's great instructions on reeducating intellectuals and train more successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution, they have summarized some experiences in reeducating young intellectuals by using Chairman Mao's brilliant philosophical thought.

Viewing Young Intellectuals with the One-Divides-into-Two Approach

The chemical defense platoon took in a batch of young intellectuals, which not only infused the platoon with fresh blood but also brought new problems to the platoon's work. These students, who had been educated under the revisionist line, were detached from class struggle, from the workers and peasants, and from reality. After coming to the army, they exposed various problems. Some felt that serving as an ordinary soldier was a waste of talent and had no future; some were afraid of hardship and fatigue and were not contented with their work in the army. One young intellectual joined the army with the personalistic motive of becoming an officer. However, after arriving at the army, he became an infantryman and was assigned to a production task in a harsh environment with heavy labor, so he was always gloomy. Some people said of him: "He lives a loose life," "He speaks in a pedantic way," "He cannot endure hardship in farm work," "He cannot distinguish weeds from crops when holding a hoe." They thought he was beyond redemption.

How should one view young intellectuals with many faults? The party branch of the chemical defense platoon repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on the one-divides-into-two approach: "One must look at problems from all sides, not from one side only." "These comrades' method of looking at problems is wrong. They do not look at the essential and principal aspects of problems, but emphasize non-essential and non-principal aspects." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, they conducted thorough investigations and research and found: these young intellectuals are basically good. They are of worker-peasant origin and have grown up in the new society. They love the Party, love Chairman Mao, and love socialism. They actively applied to join the People's Liberation Army, which shows that they are willing to integrate with the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serve the people. On the other hand, these young intellectuals do have some shortcomings, which shows that the struggle between the bourgeoisie and us for the younger generation is fierce. This requires us to make efforts to reeducate them, so that they will walk the path of integrating with the workers, peasants, and soldiers and become revolutionary intellectuals of the proletariat. The party branch, on the one hand, organized the whole platoon to study Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Absorb a Large Number of Intellectuals," raising their understanding of the significance of intellectuals participating in the revolution and grasping the Party's policy toward intellectuals; on the other hand, with great enthusiasm, they armed the young intellectuals with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, helping them to criticize bourgeois thought and the revisionist educational line, arousing their initiative in tempering and reforming themselves, thus greatly promoting the ideological revolutionization of the young intellectuals. That young intellectual who was originally thought to be beyond redemption also quickly raised his consciousness and was praised by his comrades. He was unanimously rated as a five-good soldier and was proudly admitted to the Communist Party.

Through this fact, they deeply felt: toward intellectuals, especially those with many faults, one must view them comprehensively and see their positive factors. This is the prerequisite for doing a good job in reeducating intellectuals. Only from this point of view can one enthusiastically help them get rid of the shackles of old ideas and advance along the path of integrating with the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Awakening the Initiative of Young Intellectuals in Accepting Reeducation

The party branch repeatedly educated the young intellectuals to integrate well with the workers and peasants and learn from the workers, peasants, and soldiers. However, some comrades said: "We are also of worker-peasant origin and have grown up under the red flag. Why should we still learn from the workers and peasants?"

How to overcome the self-righteousness of some young intellectuals?

Chairman Mao said: "...External causes are the conditions of change, internal causes are the basis of change, external causes become operative through internal causes." Chairman Mao's teachings made the cadres of the chemical defense platoon realize that awakening the initiative of young intellectuals to integrate with the workers, peasants, and soldiers is the key to doing a good job in reeducation. Only by helping them raise their class struggle consciousness and awareness of line struggle, recognize the harm of the bourgeois educational line to themselves, arouse their hatred toward the revisionist educational line, can one mobilize their initiative. Otherwise, no matter how many requirements the leadership puts forward, they will not hit the mark and will not touch their hearts. Therefore, the party branch organized them to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune," conduct education through comparing the new and old societies, making the young intellectuals deeply understand that their knowledge is entirely given by the Party and Chairman Mao and should be used to serve the people wholeheartedly.

The line is the fundamental issue; what kind of line cultivates what kind of people. The party branch led them to trace the root and fiercely criticize the revisionist educational line. Everyone angrily denounced: "The traitor Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line instilled in us the theory of 'studying to become an official,' holding a literature textbook to want to become a literary figure, holding a physics or chemistry textbook to want to become an engineer or expert. It made us, the children of workers and peasants, full of bourgeois ideas, forget our roots, lose the feelings of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and cultivate the stinky airs of intellectuals. If we do not accept the reeducation of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, we will become successors of the bourgeoisie. What a dangerous situation this is!"

Establishing Models to Indicate the Direction of Effort

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In carrying out any work, we Communists must adopt two methods: one is the combination of the general and the individual, the other is the combination of leadership and the masses." The party branch of the chemical defense platoon, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings, believed that to reform the young intellectuals according to the worldview of the proletariat, one must establish models with proletarian qualities and the integration of workers and peasants, so as to guide the young intellectuals onto the correct path. Therefore, they first established the worker-peasant soldier Guo Yutai as a model for learning.

The cook Guo Yutai is a son of a poor peasant. He has deep proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao. He studies Chairman Mao's works, doing what he learns, not talking empty words. He has one heart for revolution and loves whatever he does. When he was a cook, he was in the kitchen but had his heart on the country and eyes on the world. To save coal for the country, after hundreds of experiments, he finally invented the composite stove, reducing coal consumption from one jin per person per day to two liang. Guo Yutai's model deeds, once publicized, shocked every young intellectual. They all voluntarily launched a comparison with Guo Yutai on proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao, the good learning style of learning and using in unity, the thought of serving the people, and the spirit of self-revolution. The platoon saw a wave of learning from and catching up with Guo Yutai, walking the path of integrating with the workers and peasants. The young intellectual Tian Degan paired up with Guo Yutai in a red duo. He took Guo Yutai as his model in everything, actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the "use" aspect, which helped him overcome personalistic thoughts of fame and gain, jump out of the small circle of "I," correct his attitude towards service, and love his job of raising pigs. Lacking experience in pig raising, he sought teachers everywhere and asked for advice. He cleaned the pigpen several times a day. When pigs got sick, he guarded by their side, feeding them medicine. When sows gave birth, he held a lantern and stayed in the pigpen all night. At the year-end evaluation, Tian Degan and Guo Yutai were both rated as five-good soldiers and both were awarded third-class merit citations.

　　引导知识青年沿着工农化道路前进
　　济南部队某连运用毛主席“一分为二”的光辉思想，搞好对知识青年再教育工作
    济南部队某部防化连从一九六一年以来，补入连队的十五名高中以上学生，有十四名被评为五好战士，有十三名被发展为共产党员，有十名成了部队干部。知识青年同工农同志紧密结合在一起，有力地推动了连队建设，防化连连续七年荣获四好连队称号。最近他们为了进一步落实毛主席关于对知识分子进行再教育的伟大指示，培养出更多的无产阶级革命事业接班人，总结了运用毛主席的光辉哲学思想，搞好知识青年再教育的一些经验。
    用一分为二的观点看待知识青年
    防化连接收了一批知识青年，它给连队增添了新鲜血液，同时也给连队工作带来了新问题。这些从旧学校培养的学生，由于受了修正主义教育路线的毒害，很多人脱离阶级斗争，脱离工农群众，脱离实际，他们来到部队后暴露出各种各样的问题。有的感到当普通战士是“大材小用”，没有前途；有的怕苦怕累，不安心在部队工作。有个知识青年抱着当“官”的个人主义动机当了兵，那知到部队后当了一名步兵，又赶上执行生产任务，环境艰苦，劳动繁重，因而整天闷闷不乐。有的人说他：“生活吊儿郎当”，“说话咬文嚼字”，“下地劳动不能吃苦”，“拿起锄头草苗不分”，认为是不可改造了。
    怎样看待毛病比较多的知识青年？防化连党支部反复学习了毛主席关于一分为二的教导：“看问题要从各方面去看，不能只从单方面看。”“这些同志看问题的方法不对。他们不去看问题的本质方面，主流方面，而是强调那些非本质方面、非主流方面的东西。”按照毛主席的教导，认真地进行了调查研究，大家看到：这些知识青年本质都是好的。他们出身工农，又是在新社会长大的，热爱党，热爱毛主席，热爱社会主义，积极要求参加解放军，说明他们是愿意和工农兵结合的，愿意为人民服务的。另一方面，这些知识青年身上的确存在一些缺点，这说明资产阶级和我们争夺青年一代的斗争很激烈，这就要求我们努力对他们进行再教育，使他们走同工农兵结合的道路，成为无产阶级的革命知识分子。党支部一方面组织全连学习毛主席的光辉著作《大量吸收知识分子》，提高对知识分子参加革命意义的认识，掌握党对知识分子的政策；另一方面，满腔热情地用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装知识青年的头脑，帮助他们批判资产阶级思想，批判修正主义教育路线，启发他们锻炼改造自己的自觉性，因而大大促进了知识青年的思想革命化。原来被认为不可改造的那个知识青年，也迅速地提高了觉悟，受到同志们的好评，一致评他五好战士，并光荣地加入了共产党。
    通过这个事实，使他们深刻体会到：对知识分子，特别对于毛病较多的人，要全面地看，要看到他们的积极因素，这是搞好对知识分子再教育的前提，从这点出发，才能满腔热情地帮助他们摆脱旧思想的束缚，沿着同工农兵相结合的道路阔步前进。
    启发知识青年接受再教育的自觉性
    党支部一再教育知识青年很好地同工农相结合，向工农兵学习。但是有的同志却说：“我们也是工农出身，长在红旗下，怎么还要向工农学习呢？”
    怎样克服一些知识青年的这个自来红思想呢？
    毛主席说：“……外因是变化的条件，内因是变化的根据，外因通过内因而起作用。”毛主席的教导使防化连的干部们认识到，启发知识青年同工农兵相结合的自觉性，是搞好再教育的关键。只有帮助他们提高阶级斗争观念和路线斗争觉悟，认清资产阶级教育路线对自己的毒害，激发起对修正主义教育路线的仇恨，才能调动起他们的积极性。否则，尽管领导上提出的要求再多，也说不到点上，打动不了他们的心。于是，党支部就组织他们学习《为人民服务》，进行新旧社会回忆对比的教育，使知识青年深深懂得了自己的知识完全是党和毛主席给的，应当用到全心全意为人民服务之中去。
    路线问题是根本问题，什么样的路线培养什么样的人。党支部因势利导，让大家挖根追源，狠批修正主义教育路线。大家愤怒地控诉说：“叛徒刘少奇推行的反革命修正主义教育路线，向我们灌输的是‘读书做官’论，拿起文学课本想当文学家，拿起物理、化学课本想当工程师、专家。使我们这些工农子弟满脑袋资产阶级思想，忘了本，丢掉了工农兵的感情，养成了知识分子的臭架子。我们如果不接受工农兵的再教育，就会变成资产阶级接班人。这是多么危险的情景啊！”
    树立典型，指明努力方向
    毛主席教导我们说：“我们共产党人无论进行何项工作，有两个方法是必须采用的，一是一般和个别相结合，二是领导和群众相结合。”防化连党支部根据伟大领袖毛主席的教导，认为，要按照无产阶级的世界观改造知识青年，就必须树立具有无产阶级品质的工农化的典型，才能把知识青年引向正确的轨道。于是他们首先树立了工农战士郭玉太作为学习的榜样。
    炊事员郭玉太同志是个贫农的儿子，他对毛主席怀有深厚的无产阶级感情。他学习毛主席著作做到学一点，用一点，说到做到，不放空炮，他一个心眼干革命，干一行爱一行。当炊事员时，身在灶旁，心怀祖国，放眼世界。为了给国家节省煤炭，经过几百次试验，终于创造了综合灶，用煤由每人每天一斤降到二两。郭玉太的模范事迹一宣扬，就震动了每一个知识青年。他们都自觉地展开了与郭玉太同志比对毛主席的无产阶级感情，比学用一致的好学风，比为人民服务的思想，比自我革命的精神。连队出现了学赶郭玉太，走工农化道路的热潮。知识青年田德根和郭玉太结成了一对红，他处处以郭玉太同志为榜样，活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，使他克服了个人主义名利思想，跳出了“我”字的小圈子，端正了服役态度，爱上了饲养工作。没有饲养经验，就到处求师请教，猪圈一天打扫好几次。猪有了病，他就守在猪身旁，灌药喂食。母猪生小猪，他就提着马灯，整夜侍候在猪圈里。年终总评，田德根和郭玉太双双被评为五好战士，都立了三等功。
