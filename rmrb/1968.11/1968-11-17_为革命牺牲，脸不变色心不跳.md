Title: Sacrifice for the Revolution, Unfazed and Unshaken

Millions of outstanding Party members and countless revolutionary martyrs have sacrificed themselves for the great cause of communism. On the battlefield amidst gunfire and bullets, in the enemy's prison, when the revolution called for their sacrifice, they remained "unfazed and unshaken." They thought of the revolution and acted for the revolution, never considering themselves. The traitor Liu Shaoqi attempted to poison Party members with bourgeois individualism, claiming that a Party member sacrificing for the Party's cause is to "gain the admiration of others" and to be "remembered and praised by future generations." How can a toad understand the aspirations of an eagle? How can a traitor who crawled out of a doghole understand the noble spirit of heroes who sacrifice themselves for the cause of communism!

Living to fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, dying to dedicate oneself to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line—this is the oath of our Communist Party members and revolutionary fighters. Remembering a sniper battle in Korea, thousands of American devils, under the cover of planes, tanks, and artillery, continuously attacked our position defended by only about ninety of us. The battlefield became a sea of fire, and every comrade faced the possibility of sacrifice at any moment. However, no one thought about their own life or death, nor did they think about being "admired by others" or "remembered and praised by future generations" after sacrifice. Everyone had only one belief: to defend the motherland and the Korean people, and to resolutely annihilate the enemy! We concentrated our hatred on the muzzles of our guns and bayonets, engaging in fierce combat with the enemy. This was not just a battle between two armies but also a moment of intense struggle between the ideas of "public" and "private" in our minds. Seeing the three thousand miles of Korean land trampled by the iron hooves of the American imperialists, we thought of the responsibility of an internationalist fighter. Comrades were all filled with fighting spirit. When an American tank approached the second platoon's position, I rushed forward to within about ten meters, and as the devil opened the hatch to look at our firing point, I threw a grenade into it. The tank immediately broke down. Platoon Leader Zhao Wenkuang wrote the ironclad oath "As long as I am here, the position is here," and in close combat, he bayoneted six American devils, demonstrating the revolutionary fighter's intense hatred for the enemy and the spirit of fearlessness and bravery. Such Communists who are absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao—there are countless thousands of them!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Chinese Communists, who take as their starting point the greatest interests of the broadest masses of the Chinese people, believe that their cause is completely just, and are ready to sacrifice their personal interests and even their lives for it." Our Communist Party members and revolutionary fighters, whether in times of war or during the socialist revolution and socialist construction, have always been single-minded in fighting for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, for the liberation of all mankind. Liu Shaoqi, this extreme individualist, values his own dog's life above all else and is unwilling to sacrifice himself for the people's interests. Facing the enemy's threats and temptations, he betrayed the Party and the people's interests to save his own skin, becoming a despicable traitor. The reactionary bourgeois worldview advocated by the traitor Liu Shaoqi will never deceive us.

　　为革命牺牲，脸不变色心不跳
　　战斗英雄　黄丑和
    千千万万个党的优秀儿女，无数革命先烈，为了伟大的共产主义事业，在枪林弹雨的战场上，在敌人的囚牢里，当革命需要他们牺牲的时候“脸不变色心不跳”。他们想的是革命，为的也是革命，唯独没有想自己。大叛徒刘少奇极力用资产阶级利己主义来毒害共产党员，胡说什么：一个党员为党的事业牺牲，是为了“引起别人的敬仰”，是为“万世子孙所怀念所歌颂”。癞蛤蟆怎么能理解雄鹰的志向，从狗洞里爬出来的叛徒怎么能体会到为共产主义事业而英勇献身的英雄们的高尚精神境界！
    活着为毛主席革命路线而战斗，牺牲也是为毛主席革命路线献身，这是我们共产党员和革命战士的誓言。记得在朝鲜战场的一次狙击战中，上千个美国鬼子，在飞机、坦克、大炮的掩护下，连续向我们只有九十多个人坚守的阵地上进攻，阵地成了一片火海，每个同志随时都有牺牲的可能。但是所有的同志谁也没有想到自己的生和死，更没有想到“牺牲以后”能“引起别人的敬仰”、“为万世子孙所怀念所歌颂”。大家心中只有一个信念：为了祖国，为了朝鲜人民，坚决消灭敌人！我们把仇恨凝结在枪口上，刀尖上，同敌人进行英勇搏斗。这是两军对战，也是头脑里“公”和“私”两种思想激烈斗争的时刻。我们看到朝鲜三千里的江山遭到美帝铁蹄的践踏，想到一个国际主义战士肩负的责任。同志们个个斗志昂扬。当美国鬼子的一辆坦克冲到二排阵地时，我毫不犹豫奔向离坦克十来米远的地方，趁鬼子打开顶盖看我们的火力点的一刹那，照准它投进一个手雷，坦克立即瘫痪了。四班长赵文广写了“人在阵地在”的钢铁誓言，在白刃搏斗中，用刺刀一连挑了六个美国鬼子，表现了革命战士对于敌人的无比憎恨和有我无敌、视死如归的英雄气概。象这样无限忠于毛主席的共产党员，何止成千上万！
    毛主席教导我们说：“以中国最广大人民的最大利益为出发点的中国共产党人，相信自己的事业是完全合乎正义的，不惜牺牲自己个人的一切，随时准备拿出自己的生命去殉我们的事业”。我们的共产党员和革命战士，不论是在战火纷飞的年代，还是在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期，都是一个心眼为着中国革命和世界革命，为着全人类的解放而战斗。刘少奇这个极端的利己主义者，把保全自己的狗命看得高于一切，哪里舍得为人民的利益而牺牲自己，在敌人的威胁利诱面前，为了保住自己的狗命出卖党和人民的利益，成为可耻的叛徒。大叛徒刘少奇所鼓吹的反动的资产阶级人生观，绝对迷惑不了我们。
