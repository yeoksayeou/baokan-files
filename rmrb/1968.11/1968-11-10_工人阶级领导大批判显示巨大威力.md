The workers and soldiers of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at Beijing Petroleum Institute have led revolutionary teachers and students to implement the communiqué of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Party. They have closely combined the class struggle in their unit with the great criticism, which is being carried out with great momentum.

	New China News Agency, November 9th: The workers and soldiers of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at Beijing Petroleum Institute have led the broad revolutionary teachers and students to seriously study the communiqué of the expanded 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Party. They have launched a new high tide of the great criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi.

	The entire institute's revolutionary teachers, students, and staff have set up battlefields for the great criticism everywhere. Inside and outside high buildings, along both sides of the roads, there are battlefields for the great criticism everywhere. Denunciation meetings, criticism meetings, and condemnation meetings follow one after another. From students to teachers, from staff to family members, everyone is denouncing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary crimes with their mouths and pens. The slogans "Down with Liu Shaoqi!", "Firmly support the communiqué of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee!", and "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" resound everywhere. The content of the great criticism is also richer and deeper than before. The broad revolutionary teachers and students, in conjunction with the specific circumstances of their unit, use the method of recalling and comparing to concentrate on criticizing Liu Shaoqi's revisionist educational line and bourgeois reactionary line. They recall the bitterness of the old society and compare it with the sweetness of the new society, criticizing Liu Shaoqi's crimes of restoring capitalism; they recall the bitterness of being persecuted by the revisionist educational line and bourgeois reactionary line, and compare it with the greatness of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, criticizing Liu Shaoqi's crimes of pushing the revisionist educational line and bourgeois reactionary line. Through the great criticism, the broad revolutionary teachers and students have greatly improved their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. Some teaching classes in the Mechanical Department listed the facts of workers and children of poor and lower-middle peasants being persecuted and forced to drop out of school by the revisionist educational line over the years, and angrily denounced Liu Shaoqi's crimes. A student from a poor peasant family was once intentionally harassed by a bourgeois professor during a foreign language exam, who said she "usually had poor academic performance," giving her only 59 points and forcing her to repeat a year. Some teachers and students denounced a handful of traitors, spies, and landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who, under the protection of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, climbed to the positions of professors and lecturers, spreading poison and harming the youth. Some teachers and students criticized Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the institute for pushing the bourgeois reactionary line during the Cultural Revolution, suppressing the revolutionary mass movement. Through the great criticism, the broad revolutionary teachers and students deeply realized: The traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi pushed the revisionist educational line to seize the younger generation from the proletariat and restore capitalism. Only by thoroughly criticizing Liu Shaoqi's revisionist educational line can we thoroughly establish Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and carry the proletarian educational revolution to the end.

	The broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff, in conjunction with the great criticism, have carried out the work of cleaning up the class ranks and deeply digging out a handful of class enemies hidden among the masses. The revolutionary masses of the General Affairs Department, through exposing the enemy situation, further sharpened their eyes and exposed a Kuomintang spy who had been long protected and employed by the capitalist-roaders within the institute, had been evaluated as a "five-good worker" for consecutive years, and was listed as a candidate for party membership. The revolutionary masses, with burning indignation, severely criticized this counter-revolutionary's crimes of wantonly sabotaging the Cultural Revolution. The broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff have expressed their determination to smash Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle," thoroughly eliminate its poison, seriously clean up the class ranks, and definitely dig out the hidden class enemies.

    工人阶级领导大批判显示巨大威力
    驻北京石油学院工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队领导革命师生落实党的八届十二中全会公报，紧密结合本单位阶级斗争实际，革命大批判搞得轰轰烈烈
    新华社九日讯　进驻北京石油学院的工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队，领导广大革命师生认真学习党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报，斗志昂扬地掀起了一个狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇反革命修正主义路线的革命大批判新高潮。
    全院革命师生员工在院里到处摆开了革命大批判的战场。高楼内外，大路两旁，到处是革命大批判的阵地，控诉会、批判会、声讨会一个接着一个。从学生到教师，从职工到家属，人人口诛笔伐刘少奇的反革命罪行，“打倒刘少奇！”“坚决拥护八届十二中全会公报！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”的口号声，此起彼伏。革命大批判的内容也比过去更加丰富、深刻。广大革命师生结合本单位的具体情况，用回忆对比的方法，集中地批判了刘少奇推行的修正主义教育路线和资产阶级反动路线。他们忆旧社会的苦，比新社会的甜，批判刘少奇复辟资本主义的罪行；忆受修正主义教育路线、资产阶级反动路线迫害的苦，比毛主席无产阶级革命路线的英明伟大，批判刘少奇推行修正主义教育路线和资产阶级反动路线的罪行。通过革命的大批判，广大革命师生的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟有很大提高。机械系有的教学班的师生，列举历年来工人和贫下中农子女被修正主义教育路线迫害而退学的事实，愤怒控诉了刘少奇的罪行。有一个出身于贫农家庭的学生一次考试外国语时，资产阶级教授有意刁难，说她“平时学习成绩不好”，只给五十九分，硬逼她留了一级。有的师生声讨了一小撮叛徒、特务和地、富、反、坏、右分子在刘少奇反革命修正主义路线包庇下爬上了教授、讲师的位子，大肆放毒，毒害青年的罪行。有的师生批判了刘少奇及其在院里的代理人在无产阶级文化大革命中推行资产阶级反动路线，镇压革命群众运动的罪行。通过大批判，广大革命师生深刻地认识到：叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇推行修正主义教育路线，就是为了向无产阶级争夺青年一代，复辟资本主义。只有彻底批判刘少奇的修正主义教育路线，才能大立毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底。
    广大革命师生员工结合革命大批判，深入开展清理阶级队伍的工作，深挖混在广大群众中的一小撮阶级敌人。院总务处广大革命群众，通过大摆敌情，进一步擦亮眼睛，揪出了一个被院内走资派长期包庇重用，连续数年被评为“五好职工”，并列为党员发展对象的国民党特务。革命群众怀着满腔怒火，狠批了这个反革命分子猖狂破坏文化大革命的罪行。广大革命师生员工纷纷表示，坚决砸烂刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，彻底肃清其流毒，认真清理阶级队伍，一定要把暗藏的阶级敌人挖出来。
