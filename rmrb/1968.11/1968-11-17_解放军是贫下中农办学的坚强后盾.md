We heard from the radio that comrades Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu suggested that public primary schools be transferred to the management of production brigades. Our hearts are filled with indescribable joy.

Our unit is stationed in Xishuangbanna, Jinghong County, Mengsong Township, among the Hani people. For generations, not a single person among the Hani people has had the opportunity to study. After liberation, the Hani people stood up and became masters of their own land. In 1954, we, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants of the Hani ethnic group, built the first primary school for the Hani people with our own hands. Since its establishment, this school has been managed by the poor and lower-middle peasants. Students and teachers spend half of their time participating in productive labor, and the curriculum is arranged according to the actual needs of the border agricultural villages. After graduation, the vast majority of students return to the countryside to engage in production, studying Chairman Mao's thoughts alongside the poor and lower-middle peasants and building the border defenses together. Practice has proven that community-run primary schools are excellent.

We, the border defense soldiers, will firmly hold our rifles and resolutely stand as a strong backing for the poor and lower-middle peasants. Together with them, we will ensure that the power over rural education remains firmly in the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants forever.

　　解放军是贫下中农办学的坚强后盾
　　编辑同志：
    我们从广播里听到侯振民、王庆余两同志将公办小学下放到大队来办的建议，心里有说不出的高兴。
    我连驻地——西双版纳景洪县勐宋乡哈尼族人民，祖祖辈辈没有一个人读过书。解放后，哈尼族人民翻身作了主人。一九五四年，我们和哈尼族贫下中农一起，自己动手，办起了哈尼族人民第一座小学校。这所小学从建立起，就由贫下中农进行管理。学生和教师半天参加生产劳动，并根据边疆农村的实际需要来安排课程。学生毕业后，绝大部分都回到农村参加生产，和贫下中农一同学习毛泽东思想，一同建设边防。实践证明，民办小学就是好。
    我们边防战士，一定紧握枪杆子，誓做贫下中农的坚强后盾，和贫下中农一起，把农村教育大权永远牢牢地掌握在贫下中农手中。
