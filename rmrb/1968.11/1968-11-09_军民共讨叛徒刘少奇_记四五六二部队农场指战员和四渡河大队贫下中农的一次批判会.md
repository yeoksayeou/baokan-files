The Party's Twelfth Plenum communiqué was published, and all the soldiers and workers of the 4562nd Army Farm were overjoyed and immediately held serious discussions. The Party branch, in order to implement the communiqué, decided to intensify the revolutionary criticism in the units and organized the soldiers and workers to visit the class education exhibition in Siduerhe Brigade, Huairou County.

At one in the morning, the soldiers and workers, holding high the portraits of Chairman Mao, with their backpacks on, marched continuously for six hours to reach Siduerhe Brigade, which was fifty to sixty li away. After the exhibition, all the soldiers and workers held a joint criticism meeting with the poor and lower-middle peasants on the spot, fiercely criticizing the traitor, internal spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi's advocacy of the theory of the extinction of class struggle.

The director of the brigade revolutionary committee, Wen Xianhao, holding up a piece of broken sackcloth, angrily said, "In the old society where people were exploited, the old poor peasant Wu Jinguang's family of seven had three laborers working for the landlord all year round, but they still couldn't make ends meet. The whole family covered themselves with this piece of sackcloth. Unable to make a living, the whole family fled to the outskirts to beg for food, working for the landlord for three years, but still owed the landlord 120 yuan. He was forced to sell two daughters first, then a son, and finally his wife..."

Before Wen Xianhao finished speaking, the soldiers' indignation could no longer be suppressed. "Remember the bitterness of class struggle, never forget the blood debt!" "Down with the traitor Liu Shaoqi!" "Criticize the theory of 'exploitation is beneficial'!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" The slogans echoed through the sky.

New soldier Liu Zengfu pushed his way through the crowd, holding up the bowl that poor peasant Jiao Grandma used to beg with, pointing to the ragged quilt that her family of five used, and said excitedly, "In the evil old society, which poor and lower-middle peasant family did not have a history of blood and tears? Which poor and lower-middle peasant family was not exploited by the landlords? Liu Shaoqi shamelessly said that 'exploitation is beneficial' and that the poor 'like to be exploited.' This is sheer nonsense! The Twelfth Plenum of the Party unanimously passed a resolution: to expel Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever and to remove all his Party and non-Party positions. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought!" As soon as Liu finished speaking, the political instructor Luo Buyun followed up, "The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us, 'The fundamental question of revolution is the question of state power.' Why did we suffer in the past? It was because we did not have state power; why are we sweet now? It is because state power is in the hands of the proletariat. This traitor Liu Shaoqi advocates the theory of 'exploitation is beneficial' precisely because he wants to make us coexist peacefully with the exploiting class, forget class struggle, and achieve his evil goal of restoring capitalism in China and turning the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. This is just a pipe dream! We must never forget class struggle, thoroughly criticize and expose the traitor Liu Shaoqi's revisionist thoughts, and completely eliminate all his poisonous influences!"

At this time, the number of people in the venue increased, and the meeting became more lively. "Firmly support the communiqué of the Twelfth Plenum of the Party!" "Never forget class struggle!" "Forever loyal to Chairman Mao!" "Carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end!" The slogans echoed like thunder, resonating through the sky.

    军民共讨叛徒刘少奇
    ——记四五六二部队农场指战员和四渡河大队贫下中农的一次批判会
    党的十二中全会公报发表后，四五六二部队农场全体指战员，欢欣鼓舞，立即进行了认真地讨论。党支部为了落实公报，把连队革命大批判的烈火烧得更旺，决定让同志们到怀柔县四渡河大队参观阶级教育展览。
    凌晨一点，同志们高举毛主席的画像，背起背包，经过六小时的连续行军，赶到五、六十里外的四渡河大队。参观刚结束，全体指战员就和贫下中农在现场召开了军民批判会，狠批大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇所鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭论”。
    大队革委会主任温显浩，捧起一张破麻袋片，愤怒地说：“在那吃人的旧社会，老贫农吴进桂一家七口人，就有三个劳动力成年给地主扛长活，还揭不开锅。一家人就盖这条麻袋片。家里没法混，全家到口外去逃荒，给地主扛了三年的活，倒欠下地主一百二十块钱的账。他被迫先卖了两个闺女，又卖了一个儿子，最后又卖了自己的老婆……”。温显浩还没讲完，同志们的满腔怒火再也抑制不住了。“牢记阶级苦，不忘血泪仇！”“打倒叛徒刘少奇！”“狠批‘剥削有功论’！”“毛主席万岁！”的口号声，震天动地。
    新战士刘增福从人群里挤出来，拿起贫农焦大娘过去讨饭用的瓢，指着她一家五口人盖的一床烂棉花套，激动地说：“在万恶的旧社会，我们贫下中农哪家没有血泪斑斑的家史？哪户贫下中农不受地主的剥削？刘少奇胡说什么‘剥削有功’，穷人‘喜欢剥削’，简直混蛋透顶！党的十二中全会一致通过决议：把刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外一切职务，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！”小刘刚说完，指导员骆步年同志接上去说：“伟大领袖毛主席教导我们，‘革命的根本问题是政权问题’。过去我们穷人为什么受苦？就是因为我们没有政权；现在又为什么甜？就是因为政权掌握在无产阶级手里。刘少奇这个叛徒所以鼓吹‘剥削有功论’，就是妄想叫我们和剥削阶级‘和平共处’，忘掉阶级斗争，以达到他在中国复辟资本主义、变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政的罪恶目的。这真是白日做梦！我们要念念不忘阶级斗争，把叛徒刘少奇的反革命修正主义思想批深批透，彻底肃清他的一切流毒！”
    这时，会场上人越来越多，会越开越热烈。“坚决拥护党的十二中全会公报！”“千万不要忘记阶级斗争！”“永远忠于毛主席！”“把文化大革命进行到底！”的口号声象阵阵雷鸣，响彻云霄。
