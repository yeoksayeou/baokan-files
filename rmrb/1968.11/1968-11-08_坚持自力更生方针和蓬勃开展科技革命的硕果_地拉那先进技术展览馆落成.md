The Advanced Technology Exhibition Hall in Tirana, the capital of Albania, held its opening ceremony on November 3rd. The exhibition hall showcases the rich fruits of the workers of Tirana city who have adhered to the policy of self-reliance and vigorously carried out the scientific and technological revolution.

Since last October, when the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, delivered the report "On Cooperation and the Scientific and Technological Revolution" at the Third Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, the workers of Tirana, like the people of the whole country, have launched a fiery, mass movement of technological innovation and rationalization proposals, and have achieved remarkable results. This year alone, the Dajeti Factory has produced 137 types of relatively complex machines and parts that were previously imported. The Stalin Textile Combine has manufactured printing and dyeing machines and other equipment with its own strength, and the "Partisan" Machinery Factory has produced a large number of mechanical equipment for new factories.

Members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, Chairman of the State Planning Commission Koliqi, Political Bureau member and First Secretary of the Tirana City Committee Muftiu, Political Bureau alternate member and Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Tirana City People's Council Kelaçi, Minister of Transportation Kirko, Minister of Construction Dragoti, and General Secretary of the Central Council of Albanian Trade Unions Jakova, as well as the city's technological innovators, technical personnel, and responsible persons of factories and enterprises, attended the opening ceremony of the exhibition hall.

In the exhibition hall, there are displays of small excavators manufactured by the Tirana Industrial Installation Company, semi-automatic lathes produced by the "Partisan" Machinery Factory, and telephone exchanges designed and manufactured by the postal and telecommunications department, among many other new machines and products.

The exhibition hall is organized by the Executive Committee of the Tirana City People's Council. Its establishment will help to further promote the scientific and technological revolution and facilitate the exchange of advanced production and design experiences among various factories, enterprises, schools, and design units in Tirana.
