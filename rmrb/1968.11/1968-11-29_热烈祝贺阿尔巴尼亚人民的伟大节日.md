The glorious holiday of the heroic Albanian people, the 24th anniversary of Albania's liberation, has arrived! Our entire unit of soldiers and officers, along with the people and soldiers of the entire nation and army, are celebrating the great holiday of the Albanian people with hearts full of excitement. We extend our warm holiday greetings and combat salutes to the glorious Albanian Labor Party, the heroic Albanian people, and the brave soldiers and officers of the Albanian People's Army!

Over the past 24 years, under the wise leadership of the great Marxist-Leninist Comrade Enver Hoxha, the Albanian people have traversed an extraordinary path. The Albanian Labor Party and the Albanian people have endured the severe tests of class struggle at home and abroad, surrounded by imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries. In the great struggle against imperialism and revisionism, they have forged ahead, establishing great merits. As the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, has pointed out, "The Albanian people, with swords in hand, have blazed a trail through history."

The heroic Albanian people, following Comrade Hoxha's great teaching of "building socialism with one hand holding a hoe and the other holding a gun," have displayed a revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle. They have achieved brilliant successes in the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

Albania's rural areas have rapidly achieved electrification, and agricultural production is thriving. By emphasizing proletarian politics and promoting the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking, this year's agricultural production has again yielded a gratifying harvest. The industrial production value for the first nine months of this year has increased by 51% compared to 1960. This is a great victory for the Albanian Labor Party's policy of national industrialization.

In recent years, the Albanian Labor Party, to consolidate proletarian dictatorship and prevent the restoration of capitalism, has launched a vigorous revolutionary transformation movement and proposed a series of major revolutionary measures. This year, Comrade Enver Hoxha wisely proposed educational revolution and worker supervision, further enriching the content of the revolutionary transformation movement and more powerfully promoting the revolutionary transformation of the people's thinking. This revolutionary transformation movement has further consolidated Albania's proletarian dictatorship and provided valuable experience for the history of international proletarian dictatorship.

In the entire revolutionary transformation movement, the heroic Albanian People's Army, as a pillar of proletarian dictatorship, has become even stronger and more combat-ready. Under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha, the Albanian People's Army has raised high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism, emphasized proletarian politics, and implemented revolutionary measures such as the abolition of military ranks and others, achieving significant successes in revolutionary construction. The Albanian People's Army has bravely stood at the forefront of the struggle to defend Albania's socialist revolution and socialist construction, becoming a steel wall to defend Albania's proletarian dictatorship.

The Albanian Labor Party and the Albanian people have always held high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism, engaging in unyielding, principled struggles against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism led by the Soviet revisionist clique and their lackeys. The Albanian Labor Party and the Albanian people have stood firmly at the forefront of the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle, supporting the struggles of all oppressed peoples and nations around the world for liberation. They have made outstanding contributions to defending Marxism-Leninism and advancing the international proletarian revolutionary cause!

Not long ago, the heroic People's Republic of Albania solemnly announced its withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact, which was controlled by the Soviet revisionist clique and was aggressive in nature. This revolutionary action dealt a heavy blow to Soviet social-imperialism, greatly encouraging the revolutionary peoples of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries in their struggle against modern revisionism led by the Soviet revisionist clique. It also greatly encouraged the revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in their struggles against imperialism, against modern revisionism, and for national liberation. It has greatly boosted the morale of revolutionary peoples around the world and struck a heavy blow to the arrogance of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries.

Today, the Albanian people are stronger than ever, and the light of socialism shining from Albania is more brilliant than ever! The Albanian Labor Party is truly a great Marxist-Leninist party; the Albanian people are truly heroic; the People's Republic of Albania is truly a strong bastion of socialism standing on the European continent.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "'Though we are separated by mountains and seas, our hearts are close.' Although China and Albania are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, our hearts are connected." In the great struggle against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism led by the Soviet revisionist clique and their lackeys, the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Albania have established an extremely deep revolutionary friendship. Our friendship is personally forged by the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha. It is based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. We have common revolutionary goals and lofty revolutionary ideals. Our friendship is the greatest friendship in the world.

The peoples of China and Albania are bound by blood and fate. We support each other, help each other, and inspire each other. The struggle of the Albanian people is our struggle; the victory of the Albanian people is our victory. No matter what storms may arise in the world, the Chinese people will forever stand shoulder to shoulder with the brotherly Albanian people, advancing together. The seven hundred million Chinese people, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will forever stand together with the Albanian people, fight together. All Marxist-Leninists of the world, all revolutionary peoples of the world, unite! Let us strive to overthrow imperialism, overthrow modern revisionism, overthrow the reactionaries of all countries, and fight to the end for a new world without imperialism, without capitalism, without an exploitative system. The final victory will surely be ours!

    热烈祝贺阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大节日
    北京卫戍区某部　怀军
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民的光辉节日，阿尔巴尼亚解放二十四周年来到了！我们部队全体指战员和全国人民、全军指战员一道，以无比兴奋的心情，热烈庆祝阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大节日。我们向光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民和英勇的阿尔巴尼亚人民军指战员致以节日的亲切问候和战斗敬礼！
    二十四年来，阿尔巴尼亚人民在以伟大的马克思列宁主义者恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的英明领导下，走过了不平凡的道路。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民在帝国主义、现代修正主义和反动派的重重包围中，经历了国内外阶级斗争大风浪的严峻考验，在反帝反修的伟大斗争中披荆斩棘，建立了伟大的功勋。正如阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志所指出的，“阿尔巴尼亚人民手执宝剑开辟了历史的道路。”
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民遵照霍查同志“一手拿镐，一手拿枪建设社会主义”的伟大教导，发扬自力更生，艰苦奋斗的革命精神，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中取得了辉煌的成就。
    阿尔巴尼亚农村加速了实现电气化，农业生产欣欣向荣。由于突出无产阶级政治，促进人的思想革命化，今年的农业生产又获得了可喜的丰收。今年头九个月的工业生产产值比一九六○年增加了百分之五十一。这是阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的国家工业化政策的一个伟大胜利。
    近几年来，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党为了巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，开展了轰轰烈烈的革命化运动，提出了一系列革命化的重大措施。今年，恩维尔·霍查同志又英明地提出了教育革命和工人阶级监督，从而进一步丰富了革命化运动的内容，更加有力地推进全国人民的思想革命化。这个革命化运动，进一步巩固了阿尔巴尼亚的无产阶级专政，并为国际无产阶级专政的历史提供了宝贵经验。
    在整个革命化运动中，作为无产阶级专政的柱石的英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民军更加强大，更加战斗化了。在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和恩维尔·霍查同志领导下，阿尔巴尼亚人民军高举马克思列宁主义的伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，采取了取消军衔制度和其它一系列的革命化措施，在革命化建设上取得了重大成就。阿尔巴尼亚人民军在保卫阿尔巴尼亚社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中，英勇地站在斗争的最前列，成为捍卫阿尔巴尼亚无产阶级专政的钢铁长城。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民，一贯高举马克思列宁主义的伟大红旗，同以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏修叛徒集团为首的现代修正主义及其走狗进行了针锋相对的、毫不妥协的斗争。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民坚持真理，坚持原则，不畏强暴，不怕困难，敢于顶逆风，战恶浪，坚定地站在反帝反修斗争的最前列，积极地支持世界上一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取解放的斗争，为捍卫马克思列宁主义，推进国际无产阶级革命事业做出了卓越贡献！
    不久前，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国庄严宣布退出被苏修叛徒集团一手控制的、侵略性的华沙条约。这一革命行动给了苏修社会帝国主义以沉重打击，大大鼓舞了苏联和东欧各国革命人民反对以苏修叛徒集团为首的现代修正主义的斗争，也大大鼓舞了亚非拉各国革命人民反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义、争取民族解放的斗争。它大长了世界各国革命人民的志气，大灭了帝修反的威风。
    今天，阿尔巴尼亚人民比任何时候都更加坚强，阿尔巴尼亚这盏社会主义明灯放射出来的光芒，比任何时候都更加灿烂辉煌！阿尔巴尼亚劳动党不愧为一个伟大的马克思列宁主义的党；阿尔巴尼亚人民不愧为顶天立地的英雄人民；阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国不愧为屹立在欧洲大陆上的社会主义的坚强堡垒。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“‘海内存知己，天涯若比邻’。中阿两国远隔千山万水，我们的心是连在一起的。”在反对以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏修叛徒集团为首的现代修正主义及其走狗的伟大斗争中，中阿两党、两国、两国人民建立了无比深厚的革命友谊。我们的友谊，是中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席和阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志亲手缔造的，是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的原则基础上的。我们有共同的革命目标和崇高的革命理想。我们的友谊是世界上最伟大的友谊。
    中阿两国人民血肉相连，休戚相关。我们两国人民互相支持，互相援助，互相鼓舞。阿尔巴尼亚人民的斗争，就是我们的斗争；阿尔巴尼亚人民的胜利，就是我们的胜利。不管世界上发生什么样的惊涛骇浪，中国人民都将永远和兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民并肩战斗，共同前进。用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的、经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的七亿中国人民，永远同阿尔巴尼亚人民团结在一起，战斗在一起。全世界马克思列宁主义者联合起来，全世界革命人民联合起来，誓为打倒帝国主义、打倒现代修正主义、打倒各国反动派，为实现一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界而奋斗到底。最后胜利一定是属于我们的！
