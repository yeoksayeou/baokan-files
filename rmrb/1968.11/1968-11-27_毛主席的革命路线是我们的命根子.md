In the midst of the nationwide revolutionary masses earnestly implementing the various combat tasks proposed by the Party's Eighth Plenum of the Twelfth Central Committee, seizing the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao's report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is being reissued. The important editorial by the two newspapers and one magazine has conveyed Chairman Mao's latest instructions, providing us with the best teaching materials and powerful ideological weapons to study and understand the history of the two-line struggle within the Party, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. We shout a thousand times, ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!

Chairman Mao's latest instructions teach us: "Historical experience is worth noting. A line, a viewpoint, must be constantly and repeatedly emphasized. It is not enough to tell a few people; it must be made known to the broad revolutionary masses." In his report to the Seventh Plenum of the Second Central Committee, Chairman Mao deeply analyzed the classes, class contradictions, and class struggles in China after the victory of the democratic revolution. He pointed out the differences between the correct and incorrect lines on various issues, providing us with a very clear theory, line, policy, and direction for continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Over the past decade since liberation, the struggle between the two classes and the two lines has fully proven that Chairman Mao's brilliant judgment is absolutely correct.

The people have boundless creativity. The revolutionary people of various ethnic groups in the border regions of Yunnan, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, began a magnificent socialist revolution and socialist construction after liberation. However, whenever a crucial moment in history arrived, the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, Liu Shaoqi, and his agents in Yunnan, Yan Hongyan and Zhao Jianmin, would always collude with a handful of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in society, crazily resisting and sabotaging. They would say things like, "The border is special," "The nationalities are backward," and that socialism cannot be implemented. They would say that "capitalism in the border regions is not too much but too little," vigorously maintaining the reactionary rule of the local chieftains, slave owners, and feudal lords, and engaging in restoration activities. But the revolutionary masses of various ethnic groups still followed Chairman Mao's affectionate instructions, actively establishing agricultural production cooperatives and setting up people's communes, embarking on the socialist road. During periods of temporary difficulties in the national economy, Liu Shaoqi repeatedly went to Kunming, supporting his agents in Yunnan, Yan Hongyan and Zhao Jianmin, to cut down cooperatives and promote "three self-reliances and one contract," "contracting production to households," and "dividing land to households," attempting to restore capitalism. The revolutionary masses of various ethnic groups firmly believed in Chairman Mao's affectionate instructions that "only socialism can save China," smashed Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary plots, resolutely learned from the spirit of Dazhai, took Old Yu the Foolish as an example, and engaged in a struggle to change the heavens and the earth, making the collective economy continuously develop and grow stronger.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary people of various ethnic groups once again raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and conducted in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism against Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Yunnan, raising their awareness of the line struggle, and becoming even more determined to follow the socialist road. They were spirited, full of vigor, and seized the revolution while vigorously promoting production, achieving one great victory after another.

Countless ironclad facts have eloquently proven that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is our lifeline. With the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we achieved the great victory of the democratic revolution, the great victory of the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. With Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we have everything. We must emphasize and repeatedly emphasize Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, making Chairman Mao's revolutionary line deeply rooted in the hearts of the broad revolutionary masses. We must forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, fighting to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in life, and sacrificing to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in death.

In his report to the Seventh Plenum of the Second Central Committee, Chairman Mao said: "Seizing victory nationwide is only the first step of the long march of ten thousand li." "We must always maintain the style of being modest, prudent, and free from arrogance and impatience, and we must always maintain the style of hard struggle." We must always remember Chairman Mao's great teachings, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, thoroughly expose and criticize the great traitor, great spy, and great saboteur Liu Shaoqi, and completely eliminate the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism that Liu Shaoqi has spread in various aspects, seizing the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    毛主席的革命路线是我们的命根子
    云南省革命委员会副主任、女英雄　徐学惠
    在全国广大革命群众认真贯彻党的八届十二中全会提出的各项战斗任务，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大好形势下，重新发表毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》，两报一刊的重要社论传达了毛主席的最新指示，为我们学习和领会党内两条路线斗争史，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，提供了最好的教材和强大的思想武器。我们一千遍一万遍地高呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！
    毛主席的最新指示教导我们：“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道。”毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告，深刻地分析了我国民主革命胜利以后的阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，指出了正确路线和错误路线在各个问题上的分歧，为我们在无产阶级专政条件下继续革命制定了极其明确的理论、路线、方针和政策。解放后十多年来，两个阶级、两条路线的斗争完全证实了毛主席的英明论断无比正确。
    人民群众有无限的创造力。地处云南边疆的各族革命人民群众，解放后在毛主席的革命路线指引下，开始了轰轰烈烈的社会主义革命和社会主义建设。可是每当历史的关键时刻，党内头号走资派刘少奇及其在云南的代理人阎红彦、赵健民之流，总是要勾结社会上一小撮地、富、反、坏、右，疯狂地进行反抗和破坏。他们胡说什么：“边疆特殊”、“民族落后”，不能搞社会主义，胡说什么“边疆资本主义不是太多，而是太少”，极力维护边疆的土司、头人、奴隶主的反动统治，大搞复辟活动。但各族革命群众仍然遵照毛主席的亲切教导，积极建立农业生产合作社和大办人民公社，走上了社会主义道路。在国民经济遇到暂时困难的时期，刘少奇几次窜到昆明，支持他在云南的代理人阎红彦、赵健民之流，大砍合作社，推行“三自一包”、“包产到户”、“分田到户”，妄图复辟资本主义。各族革命群众坚信毛主席“只有社会主义能够救中国”的亲切教导，粉碎了刘少奇的反革命阴谋，坚决学习大寨精神，以老愚公为榜样，进行改天换地的斗争，使集体经济不断发展壮大。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，各族革命人民又高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，对刘少奇及其在云南的代理人开展了深入持久的革命大批判，提高了路线斗争觉悟，更加坚定了走社会主义道路的决心。他们精神振奋，意气风发，狠抓革命，猛促生产，取得了一个又一个的伟大胜利。
    无数铁的事实，雄辩地证明了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线是我们的命根子。有了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引，我们取得了民主革命的伟大胜利，取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利，取得了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。有了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就有了我们革命人民的一切。我们要大讲特讲毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，使毛主席的革命路线在广大革命群众心上牢牢地扎下根子。我们要永远忠于毛主席的革命路线，生为捍卫毛主席的革命路线而战斗，死为捍卫毛主席的革命路线而献身。
    毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告中说：“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。”“务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。”我们应当永远记住毛主席的这一伟大教导，在毛主席革命路线的指引下，把大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇批臭批透，彻底肃清刘少奇在各个方面所散布的反革命修正主义流毒，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利！
