	Malaya (including Singapore) some political parties and organizations strongly protest the puppet regime's persecution of patriotic fighters

	BEIJING, Nov. 21 (Xinhua) — According to reports from Singapore, the Malayan (including Singapore) some political parties and organizations have recently issued statements strongly condemning the atrocities committed by the puppet regime of Rahman and Lee Kuan Yew, who are lackeys of U.S. and British imperialism, in Malaya. They have been wildly arresting anti-imperialist patriots and revolutionary masses.

	The statement from the Malayan Socialist Front pointed out that on the night of November 9, the puppet regime of Rahman and Lee Kuan Yew in Singapore brutally arrested members of the Malayan Socialist Front and students. By November 12, more than 150 anti-imperialist patriots and revolutionary masses had been illegally arrested by the reactionary regime in Malaya and Singapore.

	The statement said that for decades under the rule of U.S. and British imperialism, tens of thousands of anti-imperialist patriots in Malaya have been arrested, exiled, and killed. The statement demanded that the puppet regime of Rahman and Lee Kuan Yew immediately and unconditionally release all illegally arrested patriots and unconditionally release all political prisoners.

	Revolutionary cadres from some local organizations of the Malayan Labor Party stated that the people of Malaya, who have long been living in poverty and cold, have, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, grasped the correct line of struggle and launched various forms of mass struggles, effectively striking at the reactionaries; especially the armed struggle of the Malayan people, which has shaken the reactionary rule of the puppet regime.

	The statement said that for the series of fascist crimes committed by the puppet regime of Rahman and the blood debts owed, the revolutionary people of Malaya will surely give a powerful response.

	The statement said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our comrades must see achievements in difficulties, see light in darkness, and boost our morale." The growth of any new thing must go through a tortuous process. As long as we believe in the masses, organize the masses, and educate the masses, relying on the strength of the masses, all reactionary currents will eventually be overcome. "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are doomed to destruction—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic." Revolution is always advancing, the future is bright, and this historical trend cannot be changed by anyone. No matter how hard the enemy tries to carry out bloody suppression and arrests, it will only be digging their own graves.

	The left-wing cultural and artistic organizations in Singapore issued a statement on the 10th, saying, Chairman Mao has long pointed out wisely: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with people's will. No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the forward march of the historical wheel, revolution will inevitably occur, sooner or later, and will surely achieve victory." Today, the revolutionary flames in northern Malaya have already ignited, and this spark of revolution will surely spread like wildfire.

    马来亚人民必将向反动派讨还血债
    马来亚（包括新加坡）一些政党团体强烈抗议傀儡集团迫害爱国志士
    新华社二十一日讯  新加坡消息：据在新加坡出版的马来亚报纸《阵线报》报道，马来亚（包括新加坡）一些政党和团体最近分别发表声明，强烈谴责美英帝国主义的走狗拉赫曼、李光耀傀儡集团在马来亚各地疯狂逮捕反帝爱国志士和革命群众的滔天罪行。
    马来亚社会主义阵线的声明指出，拉赫曼、李光耀傀儡集团十一月九日凌晨在新加坡对马来亚社会主义阵线的成员和学生进行野蛮的逮捕，截至十二日为止，在马来亚大陆和新加坡被反动集团非法逮捕的反帝爱国志士和革命群众已超过一百五十人。
    声明说，几十年来，在美英帝国主义统治下的马来亚，有成千上万的反帝爱国志士被逮捕、被放逐和被杀害。声明说，拉赫曼、李光耀傀儡当局必须立即、无条件地释放所有被非法逮捕的爱国人士，必须无条件释放所有政治犯。
    马来亚劳工党的一些地方组织的革命干部在声明中说，长期生活在饥寒交迫之中的马来亚人民，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，掌握了正确的斗争路线，大力开展各种形式的群众斗争，有力地打击了反动派；特别是马来亚人民的武装斗争，震撼了傀儡政权的反动统治。
    声明说，对于拉赫曼傀儡集团犯下的一系列法西斯罪行，欠下的一笔笔血债，马来亚革命人民必将给予有力的还击。
    声明说，毛主席教导我们说：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”任何新生事物的成长都要经过艰苦曲折的过程。只要我们相信群众、组织群众、教育群众，依靠群众的力量，一切反动的逆流终归是会被克服的。“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”革命总是向前发展的，前途是光明的，这个历史的总趋势是任何人也改变不了的。尽管敌人千方百计地进行血腥镇压和逮捕，但这只能是自掘坟墓。
    新加坡左翼文化艺术团体十日发表声明说，毛主席早就英明地指出：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”今天，马来亚北方的革命战火已经燃烧起来，这一场革命的星星之火，必将燎原。
