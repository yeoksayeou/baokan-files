Chairman Mao Sent Us Good Doctors
— The People of Mali Praise the Chinese Medical Team

“Chairman Mao sent us good doctors. We sincerely thank Chairman Mao!” This is the heartfelt praise from millions of Malian people for the Chinese medical team working in Mali.

Closer Than Family

The Chinese medical team, invited by the Malian government, arrived in Mali in February this year. According to the arrangements of the Malian government, they went to the small town of Markala in the Segou region near the countryside to serve the Malian people.

The news of the Chinese medical team's arrival quickly spread throughout Markala. The Markala Hospital, where the Chinese medical team is stationed, immediately became a bustling center. People streamed in to the outpatient department of the hospital. A Malian medical staff member said that since the arrival of the Chinese medical team, the number of people coming to see the doctor has increased by two to three times. In half a year, the Chinese medical team has treated about 30,000 patients and performed approximately 350 surgeries.

In the hospital courtyard, the reporter met some patients who were about to be discharged. They eagerly praised the Chinese doctors to the reporter. A patient named Sedu Diallo said, “Two weeks ago, I was carried into this hospital with severe acute pneumonia. The Chinese doctors cured my illness. The Chinese doctors are truly closer to us than family.” He continued, “I am an agricultural worker from Dugabugu. I know that Chairman Mao sent technical personnel to help Mali successfully cultivate sugarcane and helped us build a sugar factory. Now he has sent doctors to treat our illnesses. Chairman Mao has done so much for the people of Mali! We will forever be grateful to Chairman Mao!”

A Malian medical staff member said that the Malian people have great trust in the Chinese doctors sent by Chairman Mao. Many patients who have been ill for decades have come to seek treatment since they heard that the Chinese medical team had arrived. An elderly farmer had a large hernia, making it very difficult for him to move and causing him years of pain. As soon as he heard that the Chinese medical team had arrived in Mali, he immediately traveled from several hundred kilometers away to seek treatment. Seeing that the Chinese medical staff not only took their medical work seriously but also visited patients day and night, showing great care, he was moved to say, “In my life, this is the first time I have seen a foreign doctor care so much for our working people. You are truly good doctors sent by Chairman Mao.” When he was discharged from the hospital, he wore a shining Mao badge on his chest and held a portrait of Mao, excitedly saying, “I will hang the portrait of Chairman Mao in my home so that I can always see Chairman Mao.”

Doctors Never Seen Before

One Saturday, Markala Hospital admitted an emergency patient. The Chinese medical staff immediately sprang into action for rescue. The patient had a severe incarcerated hernia, with part of the intestine trapped in the hernia sac, causing the hernia orifice to close, blood circulation to be obstructed, and the intestine to rot. The condition was very critical. The Chinese medical staff immediately performed surgery on the patient. However, during the surgery, the patient went into shock, blood pressure was unmeasurable, pulse was undetectable, and only the heart was weakly beating. After the Chinese medical staff's meticulous rescue, the surgery was completed. But the patient was still in a critical condition. Even slight movement would put the patient in danger, so the patient was left in the operating room. The Chinese medical staff took turns on duty for two days and two nights until the patient's condition improved before transferring them to the ward for further treatment.

The patient's family members and Malian medical staff who witnessed this scene were deeply moved. Some of them said they had seen doctors from many countries, but they had never seen doctors who would do everything possible to save a seemingly hopeless patient.

To better and more effectively serve the Malian people, the Chinese medical staff began learning the Malian national language, Bambara, as soon as they arrived in Mali. They wrote down the Bambara words used in conversations with patients in small notebooks and studied them diligently whenever they had time. Now they can independently communicate with patients in Bambara and treat common illnesses.

The director of Markala Hospital, Kanté, said, “The Chinese doctors have all learned Bambara, their treatment efficiency is high, and the patients are very satisfied. From this point, one can also see the spirit of serving the people of the Chinese medical staff.”

Due to long-term colonial rule, Mali is severely short of medical staff. Before independence, French colonial doctors ruled here with impunity. The Malian people often compare Chinese doctors with those colonial “doctors.”

A patient's family member told the story of their family's three generations seeking medical treatment.

This family member is named Paul. His mother suffers from severe hypertension and has been bedridden for a long time. After multiple home visits and treatments by Chinese doctors, her condition has significantly improved, and her blood pressure has gradually returned to normal. Every time the Chinese doctors braved the heat and walked to his home for treatment, he was deeply moved. He said, “I have never seen doctors who care so much for patients.”

Paul recounted his own and his daughter's experiences of being harmed by colonial “doctors” while seeking treatment: his eldest daughter became disabled due to treatment, and he himself was tortured after surgery.

An elderly man named Asana Diallo had suffered from bladder stones for twenty years. Because he did not trust Western doctors, he had not sought treatment. But when he heard the news of the arrival of the Chinese medical team, he took a three-day car ride from his distant hometown to Markala. When he arrived at the medical team's station, his condition had worsened to the point where he could no longer walk. The Chinese doctors performed surgery on him, removing two stones the size of eggs. His condition improved. He excitedly said, “I will forever remember that it was the doctors sent by Chairman Mao who cured the illness that had tormented me for twenty years.”

To the Countryside

Following the teachings of Chairman Mao, the Chinese medical team actively went to the countryside to serve the broad masses of Malian farmers.

Massina is a remote province in the Segou region, lacking medical staff and with inconvenient transportation. To better serve the farmers there, the Chinese medical team, despite the difficulties, sent six medical staff members to Massina Hospital to establish a new medical point before the rainy season. The living conditions in Massina are harsh, with no running water, so the Chinese medical staff went to the Niger River to fetch water. There are no cooks, so they cook for themselves. When there are emergency patients, they often work until eight or nine in the evening before eating. After the medical team arrived in Massina, not only did nearby farmers come for treatment, but farmers from neighboring provinces also braved the muddy roads during the rainy season to seek treatment. The Chinese medical staff, following Chairman Mao's teaching of “selflessly serving others,” showed great enthusiasm for the Malian farmers. In the first two weeks after arriving in Massina, they treated more than 2,000 patients.

A doctor at Massina Hospital highly praised the spirit of serving the Malian people shown by the Chinese medical staff. One day, he pointed to a colorful statue of a Dai ethnic female doctor treating farmers on his bookshelf, saying, “Under the guidance of Chairman Mao, even female doctors go to the countryside to serve the farmers. This is our example. We should also inspire and educate ourselves and our Malian colleagues to serve the farmers.”

The Chinese medical staff in Markala and Massina also regularly go to villages dozens of kilometers away from their stations for mobile medical services. The Malian farmers were deeply moved by the Chinese medical staff coming from afar to treat them. Once, after the Chinese medical staff finished treating patients in the village of Manebe, the local medical station director hung a portrait of Chairman Mao on the wall, and the people shouted in unison, “Long live Chairman Mao!” “The doctors sent by Chairman Mao are good!”

Long Live Chairman Mao!

In the ward of Markala Hospital, there is a patient named Lassana. The story of the Chinese doctors treating him moved many hospitalized patients. Lassana suffers from spinal meningitis, with paralysis of the limbs and incontinence. The Chinese doctors, without hesitation, came to treat him multiple times a day. After a period of treatment, his condition significantly improved. When the Chinese doctors came to treat him again, he looked at a portrait of Chairman Mao and said, “Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao's words are the best, and the Chinese doctors listen to Chairman Mao's words the most.” His sister, who was accompanying him in the hospital, added, “We will hang the portrait of Chairman Mao in our home, and every morning our whole family will wish him long life.”

Many patients who were cured by the Chinese doctors, when bidding farewell to the Chinese doctors, wore Mao badges on their chests, held portraits of Mao in their hands, and unanimously said, “The Chinese doctors sent by Chairman Mao are good!” “Long live Mali-China friendship!” “Long live Chairman Mao!”

    毛主席派来了好医生
    ——马里人民赞扬中国医疗队
    “毛主席给我们派来了好医生，我们衷心地感谢毛主席！”这是成千上万的马里人民对在马里工作的中国医疗队发自内心的赞扬。
    比亲人还亲
    中国医疗队应马里政府邀请，在今年二月来到马里以后，根据马里政府的安排，到达塞古大区靠近农村的小城马尔加拉，开始为马里人民服务。
    中国医疗队到达的喜讯，立即传遍了马尔加拉。中国医疗队所在的马尔加拉医院，立刻变成了一个热闹的中心。人们川流不息地来到马尔加拉医院门诊部。这个医院的马里医务人员说，自从中国医疗队到达后，来看病的人比以前增加了二、三倍。半年来，中国医疗队已诊治了约三万人次，动手术约三百五十多例。
    在医院的院子里，记者遇到一些病愈快要出院的病人。他们争先恐后地对记者热情赞扬中国医生。一位名叫塞杜·迪亚洛的病人说：“两个星期前，我是被抬进这个医院来的，患着严重急性肺炎，中国医生治好了我的病，中国医生对我们简直比亲人还亲啊”。他接着说：“我是杜加布古的农业工人，我知道毛主席派了种甘蔗的技术人员帮助马里试种成功了甘蔗，还帮助我们建设了糖厂，现在又派了医生来给我们治病，毛主席为我们马里人民作了多少好事啊！我们永远感谢毛主席！”
    一位马里医务人员说，马里人民十分信赖毛主席派来的中国医生。有许多病人患病几十年，这次听说中国医疗队来了，他们都赶来治病。有一位老农民，患巨大型的疝气，行动非常不便，受了多年的痛苦。他一听到中国医疗队到了马里，立即从几百公里外赶来治病。他看到中国医务人员不仅在医疗上认真负责，而且不分昼夜多次探视病人，关怀备至。他感动地说：“我活到这么大年纪，第一次看到一个外国的医生对我们劳动人民这样关心。你们不愧是毛主席派来的好医生。”当他病愈出院时，他胸前戴上金光闪闪的毛主席像章，手捧毛主席像，兴奋地说：“我要把毛主席像挂在我的家里，使我经常看到毛主席。”
    从没见过的好医生
    一个星期六，马尔加拉医院收了一个急诊病人，中国医务人员立刻投入战斗，进行抢救。病人患的是严重的箝闭性疝，一部分肠子，由于漏入疝囊，疝口箝闭，血液循环受到障碍，而发生腐烂，病情十分危重。中国医务人员立即为病人动手术，但在手术过程中病人又发生了休克，血压量不出，脉搏摸不到，只有心脏在微弱地跳动，经过中国医务人员精心抢救，手术完成了。但病人仍处于危急状态，稍稍搬动，病人就会发生危险，因此就把病人留在手术室内，中国医务人员轮流值班两天两夜，直到病人转危为安后，才转到病房继续治疗。
    病人的家属和在医院工作的马里医务人员看到这种情景，非常感动。他们当中有的人说：他们见过好多国家的医生，从来没有见过这样千方百计抢救一个看来是无望的病人的好医生。
    为了更好地更有效地为马里人民服务，中国医务人员一到达马里就努力学习马里的民族语言——邦巴拉语。他们把同病人交谈用的邦巴拉语的词汇抄在小本上，一有时间就刻苦学习。现在他们都已能够独立地用邦巴拉语同病人对话，诊治一般的病。
    马尔加拉医院院长康特说：“中国医生都学了邦巴拉语，看病效率高，病人很满意。从这一点上也可以看出中国医务人员为人民服务的精神。”
    由于遭受过长期的殖民统治，马里十分缺乏医务人员，独立以前是法国殖民主义者的医生在这里横行霸道。马里人民常常把中国医生同那些殖民主义“医生”加以对比。
    一个病人家属讲了他们一家三代患病求医的故事。
    这个家属名叫保尔，他的母亲患着严重的高血压，长期卧床不起。经过中国医生多次的出诊治疗，病势大为减轻，血压逐步恢复正常。每当中国医生冒着酷热，步行到他家出诊时，他非常感动。他说：我从未见过这样关心病人的医生。
    保尔讲述了他本人和他的女儿因为治病而遭受殖民主义“医生”残害的经历：他的大女儿因为治病成了残废，他自己也因为开刀而遭到折磨。
    有一个名叫阿萨纳·迪亚洛的老人，患膀胱结石病已有二十年，因为他不相信那些西方国家的医生，一直没有诊治。但当他听说中国医疗队来到的消息，就坐上汽车走了三天，从遥远的家乡来到马尔加拉。当他到达医疗队驻地时，他的病已使他走不动路。中国医生给他做了手术，取出了两块鸡蛋大小的石头。他的病好了。他激动地说，我将永远记着是毛主席派来的医生给我治好了折磨了我二十年的病。到农村去
    中国医疗队根据毛主席的教导，积极到农村去，为广大的马里农民服务。
    马西那是塞古大区的一个边远的省份，医务人员很缺，交通不便。为了便于给那里的农民服务，中国医疗队不怕困难，在今年雨季到来以前，派出了六名医务人员，到马西那的医院设了一个新的医疗点。马西那的生活条件是艰苦的，没有自来水，中国医务人员自己到尼日尔河里去打水来用；没有炊事员，自己动手做饭吃。遇到有急诊病人时，经常忙到夜晚八、九点钟才吃饭。医疗队到达马西那后，不仅附近的农民来看病，邻近省份的农民们也不顾雨季道路泥泞纷纷前来看病。中国医务人员根据毛主席“毫不利己专门利人”的教导，对马里农民满腔热忱，在到达马西那的头两个星期就诊治了两千多名病人。
    马西那医院的一位医生十分赞扬中国医务人员为马里人民服务的精神。一天，他指着放在他的书架上的中国医务人员送给他的一个傣族女医生为农民出诊的彩色塑像说：“中国医生在毛主席的教导下，就连女医生也到农村为农民服务，这是我们的榜样，我们也要鼓舞和教育我自己和我的马里同事们，要为农民服务。”
    在马尔加拉和马西那的中国医务人员还定期到驻地以外几十公里的农村去进行巡回医疗。马里农民对中国医务人民远道来为他们看病很受感动。有一次中国医务人员在茅内贝村看完病后，当地的医疗站站长把一幅毛主席像挂在墙上，人们齐声说：“毛主席好”“毛主席派来的医生好”。
    祝毛主席万寿无疆！
    马尔加拉医院的病房里有一位名叫拉萨那的病人，中国医生为他治病的故事感动了许多住院的病人。拉萨那患了脊髓炎，四肢瘫痪，大小便失禁。中国医生不嫌脏、不怕臭，每天多次来给他诊治。经过一段时间的治疗，病情大大减轻。中国医生再次去给他治病时，他看着一张毛主席像说：“毛主席啊，毛主席！毛主席的话最好，中国医生最听毛主席的话。”陪他住院的他的姐姐接着说：“我们要把毛主席像挂在我们家中，每天早晨我们全家敬祝他老人家万寿无疆。”
    许多经过中国医生治好了病的病人，在向中国医生告别时，把毛主席像章戴在胸前，把毛主席像捧在手中，异口同声地说：“毛主席派来的中国医生好！”“马中友谊万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”
                          新华社记者（附图片）
    在桑给巴尔工作的中国医疗队坚持每周到农村巡回医疗，受到广大劳动人民的热烈欢迎和高度赞扬。这是中国医生到桑给巴尔农民家里，为老农治伤。
