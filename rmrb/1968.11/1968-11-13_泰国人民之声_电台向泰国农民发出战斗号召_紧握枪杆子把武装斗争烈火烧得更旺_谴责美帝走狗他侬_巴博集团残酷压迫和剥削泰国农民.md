"The Voice of the Thai People" radio station broadcast an article on the 5th, exposing the brutal oppression and exploitation of Thai farmers by the U.S. imperialist puppet, the Thanom-Babbo group. It called on the broad masses of farmers to unite under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, grasp their guns firmly, and use revolutionary armed struggle to overthrow the reactionary rule of the Thanom-Babbo puppet clique.

The article said that recently, the Thanom-Babbo group has been deceiving farmers with extensive propaganda, attempting to extinguish the flames of armed struggle among the farmers and divert the direction of their struggle towards "peaceful struggle" and "parliamentary struggle." The political parties of the Thanom-Babbo group and so-called "farmers' organizations" have all been active in propaganda, claiming to "help farmers solve problems such as land, rent, debt, and agricultural product prices," thereby deceiving the farmers.

The article said that the Thanom-Babbo group is the vicious enemy of the entire nation. They brutally exploit the farmers and are also the vicious enemies of the farmers. Farmers, from their own experiences, clearly know that the Thanom-Babbo group has not only not "helped" the farmers but has made the farmers even more impoverished and miserable.

The article said that during the Thanom-Babbo regime, the problem of farmers having no land has become even more severe, which is the most fundamental problem facing farmers. According to statistics from the Thanom-Babbo group, the number of landless and land-poor farmers has increased from about 25% of the total number of farmers in the past to 85%, and rents have increased by about 80% compared to the past. Loan interest rates have reached 100% to 300%, and the total debt of farmers nationwide is as high as 100 billion baht, while the price of rice is shockingly low. It is precisely the exploitative system implemented by the Thanom-Babbo group that has caused farmers to go hungry and cold, working hard all year round, but their labor fruits are all plundered.

The article said that the Thanom-Babbo group has also barbarically and on a large scale seized farmers' land, either for themselves or to provide to their American masters to build invasion military bases, causing hundreds of thousands of farmers to become homeless and unable to make a living. According to incomplete statistics, in 1967 alone, there were 60 incidents of farmers rising up to fight against the dark rule of the Thanom-Babbo group to defend their land, with more than 100,000 farmers participating in the struggle.

The article said that the Thanom-Babbo group also brutally exploits farmers through taxation, such as land tax, which has increased by hundreds of times. In some areas, such as the Bang Krathum district of Nakhon Pathom province, land tax has increased by 1,000 times. This is a very brutal exploitation.

The article said that the Thanom-Babbo group intimidates farmers who resist empty-handed, labeling them with false charges such as "crime" and "believing in communism," and even carries out brutal suppression, arrest, and massacre.

The article said that under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, farmers, in order to fight for national independence and liberate themselves, have taken up arms to fight against the Thanom-Babbo group. This is the only correct path for farmers' struggle. The Communist Party of Thailand truly represents the interests of the oppressed and exploited people. Farmers should unite under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, firmly grasp their guns, persist in people's war, and make the flames of people's war burn even more fiercely; establish rural bases, use the countryside to surround the cities, and ultimately seize national power, thoroughly solve the problems of the nation and the people, which is the path to farmers' true liberation.

　　“泰国人民之声”电台向泰国农民发出战斗号召
　　紧握枪杆子把武装斗争烈火烧得更旺
　　谴责美帝走狗他侬—巴博集团残酷压迫和剥削泰国农民
    新华社八日讯　“泰国人民之声”电台五日广播一篇文章，揭露美帝走狗他侬—巴博集团对泰国农民的残酷压迫和剥削，号召广大农民在泰国共产党的领导下团结起来，紧握手中枪，用革命武装斗争推翻他侬—巴博傀儡集团的反动统治。
    文章说，最近以来，他侬—巴博集团对农民大肆进行欺骗宣传，企图扑灭农民武装斗争的火焰，扭转农民斗争的方向，使其走上“和平斗争”和“议会斗争”的道路。他侬—巴博集团的政党和所谓“农民组织”纷纷出动进行宣传，说什么要“帮助农民解决如土地、地租、债务和农产品价格问题”，借此来欺骗农民。
    文章说，他侬—巴博集团是全国人民的凶恶敌人。他们对农民进行残酷剥削，因此也是农民的凶恶敌人。农民从自己的经历中清楚知道，他侬—巴博集团非但没有“帮助”过农民，反而使农民变得更加贫困和痛苦。
    文章说，在他侬—巴博统治时期，农民没有土地的问题，变得更加严重了，这是农民面临的最根本的问题。据他侬—巴博集团的统计，无地和少地的农民已从过去占全国农民总数大约百分之二十五增加到百分之八十五，地租也比过去增加了大约百分之八十，贷款利率竟达百分之一百到百分之三百，全国农民的债务总数高达百亿铢，而稻谷价格则低得惊人。正是他侬—巴博集团所推行的这种剥削农民的制度，使得农民吃不饱穿不暖，一辈子整年累月辛勤劳动，但劳动果实却全被掠夺光。
    文章说，他侬—巴博集团还空前野蛮地大规模强占农民的土地，或据为己有，或提供给他们的美国主子作建立侵略军事基地之用，造成数十万农民流离失所，无法谋生。据不完全统计，仅仅在一九六七年，农民为了保卫自己的土地而奋起同他侬—巴博集团的黑暗统治进行斗争的事件，就有六十起，参加斗争的农民达十多万人。
    文章说，他侬—巴博集团还通过征税向农民进行残酷压榨，如土地税竟增加了几百倍，有些地区如北榄坡府的打克里县，土地税竟增加了一千倍。这是十分残酷的剥削。
    文章说，他侬—巴博集团对赤手空拳进行反抗的农民肆意进行恫吓，给加上“犯法”、“信仰共产主义”等莫须有的罪名，甚至实行残酷镇压、逮捕和屠杀。
    文章说，在泰国共产党的正确指导下，农民为了争取国家的独立和解放自己，他们纷纷拿起武器同他侬—巴博集团进行斗争。这是农民唯一正确的斗争道路。泰国共产党真正代表了被压迫被剥削人民的利益，农民要在泰国共产党领导下团结起来，紧紧地握住枪杆子，坚持人民战争，把人民战争的火燃烧得更加炽烈；建立农村根据地，以农村包围城市，最后夺取全国政权，彻底解决国家和人民的问题，这是农民能够获得真正解放的途径。
