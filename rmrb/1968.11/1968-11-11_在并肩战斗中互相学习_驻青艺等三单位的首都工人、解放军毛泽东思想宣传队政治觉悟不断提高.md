The motherland's mountains and rivers are red, and the capital is bathed in the morning sun.

On September 25 this year, a group of outstanding workers from the Beijing No. 3 Cotton Mill and all the soldiers from the Fourth Company of a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region, following Chairman Mao's great directive that "the working class must lead everything," marched into the China Youth Art Theatre and two other units. They took to the stage of the struggle to criticize, repudiate, and reform the superstructure. The workers and soldiers in the propaganda teams repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great directive that "our country has a population of 700 million, and the working class is the leading class," and their hearts were filled with excitement. From the depths of their hearts, they voiced a common resolve: resolutely make Chairman Mao proud!

In their work, the workers and soldiers learned from each other, supported each other, and helped each other. They forged a close combat friendship in their side-by-side struggle, continuously raising their political consciousness.

Chairman Mao said, "The working class has the most foresight, is selfless, and is the most thorough in revolution." The soldiers in the propaganda teams, following Chairman Mao's instructions, always took the workers as their example and wholeheartedly became students of the working class. As soon as they entered the China Youth Art Theatre and the other two units, they extensively launched activities to learn from the working class. Whenever they arranged work, they would arrange for studying the noble qualities of the working class's unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao; whenever they inspected work, they would pay attention to the situation of learning from the working class; whenever they summarized work, they would seriously summarize their experiences of learning from the working class; and whenever they commended advanced individuals, they would commend those who learned well from the working class. Every weekend, during the company's meeting, each class would discuss: "What have we learned from the worker comrades this week?" In the evenings, one could often see the soldiers studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the worker comrades, humbly listening to the worker comrades share their experiences of studying Chairman Mao's works. The soldiers heard that the Beijing No. 3 Cotton Mill had representatives who participated in the National Day celebrations this year, and they were all overjoyed. They beat drums and gongs to invite the representatives from the factory, listening to them describe their happy experience of seeing the great leader Chairman Mao. The soldiers saw that the workers dared to speak out and were clear in their stance, and wherever they went, the "old difficult problems" were quickly solved. They were greatly inspired and educated. The soldiers said, "The working class is the most loyal to Chairman Mao, the working class has the reddest heart, learning from the working class is the most worthwhile, and being a student of the working class is forever without end."

In the China Youth Art Theatre and the other two units, one could see everywhere the soldiers treating the workers as their teachers, and one could hear at any time the workers' stories of learning from the soldiers. One evening, a worker responsible comrade had already gone to bed but still asked the army's Li Political Instructor, "Old Li, can you tell me how the army deals with active thoughts?" Li Political Instructor, seeing the worker comrade so humble, couldn't calm his heart. So, he sincerely talked with the worker comrade until late at night, introducing to the worker comrade, bit by bit, the army's experiences in creating a four-good company.

The workers from the Beijing No. 3 Cotton Mill, with their deep love for the army, specially presented the soldiers with a replica of the mango given by the great leader Chairman Mao to the workers of the capital and a Chairman Mao badge made by their factory. The soldiers immediately held an exhibition in the entire company and convened a meeting to distribute Chairman Mao badges, inviting the worker comrades to speak on the stage. The army officers and soldiers, seeing the workers' gift of the mango replica and wearing the golden Chairman Mao badges, all pledged their loyalty to Chairman Mao, expressing their determination to be the strong backbone of the working class and to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end. All this also deeply educated the worker comrades, who said, "The army always puts Mao Zedong Thought in the forefront and insists on the Four Firsts, truly a good example for us to learn from."

After the Beijing No. 3 Cotton Mill sent a large number of outstanding workers to join the propaganda teams, they still overfulfilled their production tasks. The soldiers immediately sent people to the factory to congratulate them. After returning from the factory, Company Commander Liu Jixue promptly propagated to the soldiers and the masses the advanced deeds of the workers in the factory in seizing the revolution and promoting production. In this way, both the entire cadre and soldiers were inspired, and the revolutionary masses were educated.

The workers' propaganda teams entering the superstructure to lead the struggle to criticize, repudiate, and reform is a serious class struggle. In the China Youth Art Theatre and the other two units, a few people with ulterior motives spread rumors and slander. The soldiers immediately responded with counterattacks. The soldiers vigorously propagated to the masses the great significance of the working class leading the struggle to criticize, repudiate, and reform the superstructure, helping the intellectuals consciously accept re-education by the working class.

The soldiers always acted as the strong backbone of the working class. The worker comrades also paid attention to strengthening military-civilian unity at any time, vigorously praising the People's Liberation Army as the great army personally led by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, and specially speaking highly of the People's Liberation Army's great achievements in the "three supports and two militaries" work. The worker comrades and the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army intertwined their proletarian feelings, and their red hearts loyal to Chairman Mao were tightly bound together. They forged deep affection in their struggle to do a good job in the struggle to criticize, repudiate, and reform the superstructure.

The ship sails with the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. The comrades in the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams of workers and soldiers stationed in the China Youth Art Theatre and the other two units, with revolutionary enthusiasm, are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, shoulder to shoulder and hand in hand, seriously implementing the various battle calls issued by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, realizing the dictatorship of the proletariat in the superstructure, including all cultural fields, and turning the China Youth Art Theatre and the other two units into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

　　在并肩战斗中互相学习
　　驻青艺等三单位的首都工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队政治觉悟不断提高
    祖国山河一片红，首都处处尽朝晖。
    今年九月二十五日，北京国棉三厂的部分优秀工人和北京部队某部四连的全体指战员，遵照毛主席关于“工人阶级必须领导一切”的伟大教导，浩浩荡荡开进了中国青年艺术剧院等三个单位，登上了上层建筑斗、批、改的舞台。宣传队的每一个工人同志和解放军战士一遍又一遍地学习毛主席关于“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级”的伟大教导，心情格外激动，从内心迸发出一个共同的声音：坚决为毛主席争气！
    工人和解放军同志在开展工作中，互相学习，互相支持，互相帮助，在并肩战斗中结下了亲密的战斗友谊，不断提高着自己的政治觉悟。
    毛主席说：“工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。”宣传队的解放军同志，遵照毛主席的教导，处处以工人同志为榜样，一心一意当工人阶级的小学生，他们一进驻中国青年艺术剧院等三个单位，就广泛开展了向工人阶级学习的活动。每当安排工作的时候，都要安排学习工人阶级无限忠于毛主席的高贵品质；每当检查工作的时候，都注意检查向工人阶级学习的情况；每当总结工作的时候，都认真总结向工人阶级学习的体会；每当表扬先进的时候，都大力表扬向工人阶级学习的好同志。每周的周末班务会上，各班都要座谈讨论：“这一周我们向工人同志学到了什么？”每当傍晚，常常可以看到解放军战士们和工人同志一起学习毛主席最新指示，虚心听工人同志介绍学习毛主席著作的体会。战士们听说国棉三厂有参加今年国庆观礼的代表，无不欢欣鼓舞。他们敲锣打鼓把代表从厂子里请来，听代表们叙述见到伟大领袖毛主席的幸福情景。部队同志看到工人同志敢说敢干，旗帜鲜明，所到之处，“老大难”问题迅速解决，受到了很大的鼓舞和教育。解放军战士们说：“工人阶级对毛主席最忠，工人阶级心最红，向工人阶级学习最有学头，当工人阶级的小学生永远没有头。”
    在中国青年艺术剧院等三个单位，到处可以看到部队同志拜工人为老师的事迹，也随时可以听到工人同志向解放军学习的故事。一天晚上，一位工人负责同志已经躺下了，还问部队的李教导员：“老李，你给讲讲部队抓活思想怎么个抓法？”李教导员看到工人同志这样谦虚，心里怎么也不能平静。于是，他就诚恳地和工人同志直谈到深夜，把部队创造四好连队的体会，一点一滴地介绍给工人同志。
    国棉三厂的工人同志们怀着对解放军的无比热爱，特意把伟大领袖毛主席赠送给首都工人阶级的芒果的复制品和本厂制做的毛主席像章，送给部队同志。部队同志立即在全连进行展览，并召开颁发毛主席像章大会，请工人同志登台讲话。解放军干部战士看到工人同志赠送的芒果复制品，戴上金光闪闪的毛主席像章，纷纷向毛主席敬献忠心，表示坚决当好工人阶级的坚强后盾，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。这一切也使工人同志受到了深刻教育，他们说：“解放军事事突出毛泽东思想，处处坚持四个第一，真是我们学习的好榜样。”
    国棉三厂抽出大批优秀工人参加宣传队后，仍超额完成生产任务，部队同志立即派人到厂里贺喜。连长刘继学从工厂回来后，及时把厂里工人同志抓革命、促生产的先进事迹向战士和广大群众宣传。这样，既激励了全体干部战士，又教育了广大革命群众。
    工人宣传队开进上层建筑领域领导斗、批、改，这是一场严重的阶级斗争。中国青年艺术剧院等三个单位少数别有用心的家伙，散布流言蜚语，战士们听到后立即给以还击。解放军同志向群众大力宣传工人阶级领导上层建筑斗、批、改的伟大意义，帮助知识分子自觉接受工人阶级的再教育。
    战士们处处做工人阶级的坚强后盾，工人同志们也随时注意加强军民团结，大力宣扬人民解放军是毛主席亲自领导的、林副主席直接指挥的伟大军队，大讲特讲人民解放军在“三支”“两军”工作中的丰功伟绩。工人同志和解放军战士的无产阶级感情交织在一起，忠于毛主席的红心紧紧联在一起，他们在为搞好上层建筑的斗、批、改的战斗中结下了深情厚谊。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。驻中国青年艺术剧院等三个单位的工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的同志们，满怀革命豪情，决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，肩并肩，手挽手，认真落实党的八届扩大的十二中全会发出的各项战斗号召，实现无产阶级在上层建筑其中包括在各个文化领域的专政，把中国青年艺术剧院等三个单位办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
