The agricultural middle school in Cunmao, Laoguan Commune, Laian County, Anhui Province, has, under the management of poor and lower-middle peasants, cultivated a batch of laborers with socialist consciousness and education for the countryside.

In the high tide of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Laoguan Commune, with great revolutionary enthusiasm, built on the foundation of the permanent people's school in the original Cunmao Production Brigade. They used three thatched houses as classrooms, door panels as blackboards, and mud bricks as desks. They did not spend a single penny of state funds and self-reliantly established the Cunmao Agricultural Middle School. They joyfully said, "The threshold of this school is not high, and it is right at our doorstep. It can cultivate our own successors." A handful of class enemies were extremely hostile to this, spreading rumors and slandering behind the scenes, saying things like, "The agricultural middle school is like a sore leg watching a play, it can't last long." The poor and lower-middle peasants saw through the class enemies' schemes at a glance and resolutely struck down their sabotage activities. The party branch secretary, who was born into a poor peasant family, personally lectured to the masses on Chairman Mao's instructions regarding the education revolution. They took "Should the agricultural middle school be run? By whom?" as the topic and carried out mass discussions. Under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions on the education revolution, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants expressed, "Chairman Mao is supporting us, we must make Chairman Mao proud and run the agricultural middle school well!" They eagerly sent their children to the agricultural middle school.

From 1960 to 1962, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Anhui Province madly opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian education line and tried to cut down the Cunmao Agricultural Middle School several times. The poor and lower-middle peasants stood firm against this evil wind and resolutely said, "The product of the Great Leap Forward is good! Whoever dares to touch our agricultural middle school even a little, we will not agree!" Some teachers who had once thought of giving up also regained their confidence. They said, "Chairman Mao has shown us the way, the poor and lower-middle peasants are supporting us, the more we do, the clearer our minds become, and the more enthusiastic we are."

For a period, the school, under the influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist education line, had once taken the graduating class students into the city to review for exams, pursuing "admission rates" and the bourgeois so-called "teaching quality." On this major issue of where the agricultural middle school should go, the poor and lower-middle peasants pointed out bluntly: The people we cultivate should be laborers with socialist consciousness and education, not those "scholars" who are detached from proletarian politics, detached from the working-class and peasant masses, and detached from production practice. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Laoguan Commune, based on Chairman Mao's teachings on "Our educational policy should enable those who receive education to develop morally, intellectually, and physically, and become laborers with socialist consciousness and education," broke away from old frameworks and actively carried out the education revolution in the agricultural middle school.

In establishing a new type of teaching staff, they planned to invite workers, peasants, and soldiers to the school's lectern. They invited activists who actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works to teach courses on studying Chairman Mao's works; invited old poor peasants who had suffered deeply in the old society to lecture on family history, village history, and commune history; invited revolutionary cadres from the commune and production brigade to give reports on the situation, lecture on new characteristics, new trends, and new problems in rural class struggle; invited workers to lecture on agricultural machinery; invited accountants from the commune and production brigade to teach abacus and accounting methods; invited soldiers and militia cadres to lecture on the Four Firsts and the Three-Eight Style, and conduct military training, etc. The workers, peasants, and soldiers' lectures were closely related to the actual situation of the three great revolutionary movements, simple and easy to understand, deep and vivid, enabling students to learn many things that cannot be learned from books.

In terms of teaching content, the poor and lower-middle peasants put studying and applying Chairman Mao's thoughts and changing one's worldview in the first place, with the first class being a lecture and application meeting on studying and applying Chairman Mao's thoughts, and the first thing being participating in labor. Under the premise of emphasizing proletarian politics and adapting to the needs of the three great revolutionary movements, they reformed Chinese, mathematics, and agricultural technology courses. For example, in Chinese classes, they wrote "three histories," wrote revolutionary critical articles, and wrote application documents; in mathematics classes, they taught accounting and surveying knowledge, and learned to use the abacus; in agricultural technology classes, they combined teaching content with production content, classroom teaching with on-site teaching. They also combined agricultural technology classes to carry out scientific experiments, spread advanced technology to the communes and production brigades, and ensured that "before the season arrives, the technology is taught, and when the season arrives, comprehensive guidance is provided." Over the years, the school has provided more than 20,000 pounds of high-quality rice seeds to the communes and production brigades.

This school is closely linked to production practice, serves the production struggle, and solves problems in agricultural production. For example, preventing and treating livestock diseases is a long-standing difficult problem in the local area. The poor and lower-middle peasants suggested that the agricultural middle school cultivate some veterinarians. The school immediately recruited a batch of junior high school graduates and opened a veterinary class. They invited veterinarians from the county agricultural bureau to be teachers and invited "local veterinarians" to give lectures at the school. They also set up a veterinary clinic on campus, combining classroom teaching with on-site teaching, and practicing while teaching. Since April 1965, they have treated more than 170 large livestock and nearly 9,000 sick pigs, and given preventive injections to 600,000 livestock and poultry, greatly reducing the incidence of livestock diseases, and are very popular among the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Over the past decade, the Cunmao Agricultural Middle School has been highly praised by the poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants praised it as "our agricultural middle school," saying, "The young people cultivated by the agricultural middle school love Chairman Mao, love labor, are both literate and martial, and are our good descendants." After graduating from the agricultural middle school, the students returned to the production teams. They are not only laborers with socialist consciousness and education but also instructors in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, propagandists of the party's policies, and news readers. Through practice, many of them have become accountants, work-point recorders, commune and production brigade cadres, militia backbone members, and part-time primary school teachers. Many have become technical personnel, water pump operators, etc., in the production teams.

    贫下中农管理学校　一代新人茁壮成长
    储茂农业中学培养出一批革命接班人
    据新华社合肥三十一日电　安徽省来安县相官公社储茂农业中学在贫下中农的管理下，为农村培养出一批有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。
    在一九五八年大跃进高潮中，相官公社的广大贫下中农以极大的革命热情，在原储茂大队的常年民校的基础上，用三间草屋做教室，用门板做黑板，用土坯砌成课桌，没花国家一分钱，自力更生地办起了储茂农业中学。他们欣喜地说：“这个学校门槛不高，又办在家门口，可以培养我们自己的接班人了。”一小撮阶级敌人对此极端仇视，在背后煽阴风、点鬼火，说什么“农中是臁疮腿看戏，站不长”。贫下中农一眼就看穿了阶级敌人的阴谋，坚决打击了他们的破坏活动。贫农出身的党支部书记亲自向群众宣讲毛主席有关教育革命的指示，以“农中要不要办？靠谁办？”为题，开展了群众性的讨论。广大贫下中农在毛主席关于教育革命的光辉指示鼓舞下，纷纷表示：“毛主席给我们撑腰，我们一定要为毛主席争气，把农中办下去，办好！”他们争先恐后把自己的子女送到农中去。
    一九六○年到一九六二年，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在安徽的代理人，疯狂反对毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，几次要砍掉储茂农中。贫下中农顶住了这股妖风，坚定地说：“大跃进的产物就是好！”“谁要动我们农中一根毫毛，我们坚决不答应！”有些曾经想打退堂鼓的教师，也坚定了信心。他们说：“毛主席给我们指明了道路，贫下中农为我们撑腰，我们越干心越明，越干劲越大。”
    有一个时期，学校受反革命修正主义教育路线的影响，曾经把毕业班的学生带进城里温课迎考，追求“升学率”，追求起资产阶级的所谓“教学质量”。在这一关系到农中向何处去的大是大非的问题上，贫下中农一针见血地指出：我们培养的人，应该是有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，不要那种脱离无产阶级政治、脱离工农群众、脱离生产实践的“洋秀才”。相官公社的贫下中农根据毛主席关于“我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”的教导，打破旧框框，在农中积极进行教育革命。
    在建立一支新型的教师队伍问题上，他们有计划地请工农兵登上学校的讲台。他们请活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子讲学习毛主席著作课；请在旧社会苦大仇深的老贫农讲家史、村史、社史；请公社、大队革命干部作形势报告，讲农村阶级斗争的新特点、新动向、新问题；请工人讲农业机械；请社、队会计教打算盘、记账方法；请解放军和民兵干部讲四个第一、三八作风，进行军训等。工农兵讲课紧密结合三大革命运动的实际，通俗易懂，深刻生动，使学生学到很多书本上学不到的东西。
    在教学内容上，贫下中农把活学活用毛泽东思想，改造世界观摆在首位，开学的第一堂课是活学活用毛泽东思想讲用会，第一件事是参加劳动。在突出无产阶级政治和适应三大革命运动需要的前提下，改革语文、数学和农业技术课。例如，语文课，写“三史”，写革命大批判文章，写应用文；数学课，讲会计、测绘等知识，学打算盘；农业技术课，采取教学内容与生产内容、课堂教学与现场教学相结合的方法。他们还结合农业技术课，大搞科学实验，向社队传播先进技术，并且做到“季节未到，技术先教，季节一到，全面指导”。几年来，学校兑换给社、队的水稻良种有二万多斤。
    这所学校密切联系生产实际，为生产斗争服务，解决农业生产中的问题。例如，当地防治牲畜疾病是个“老大难”问题，贫下中农建议农中培养一些兽医。学校当即招收了一批初中毕业生，增开了兽医班。从县农业局请来兽医当教员，并请“土兽医”来校讲课，又在校内开设兽医门诊部，实行课堂教学与现场教学相结合，边教学边实践。从一九六五年四月以来，共医治大牲畜一百七十多头，病猪近九千头，还给六十万头家畜、家禽打了防疫针，大大减少了牲畜发病率，很受贫下中农欢迎。
    十年来，储茂农业中学深受贫下中农的欢迎。贫下中农称赞它是“我们的农中”，“农中培养出来的青年娃子，热爱毛主席，热爱劳动，能文能武，是我们的好后代。”农中学生毕业后回到生产队，既是有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，又是活学活用毛主席著作的辅导员，党的方针政策的宣传员，读报员。经过实践锻炼，他们当中不少人当了会计、记工员、社队干部、民兵骨干和民办小学教师，不少人成为生产队的技术员、抽水机手。
