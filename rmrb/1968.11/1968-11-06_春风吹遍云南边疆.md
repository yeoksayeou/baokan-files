The communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Twelfth Central Committee of the Party, like a strong spring breeze, swept across the Yunnan borderlands of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, reaching the hearts of the Dai, Lahu, and Jingpo people along the Lancang River. People of all ethnic groups sang the most beautiful praises to the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

On the evening of November 1, after the people of all ethnic groups in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture listened to the communiqué on the radio, the entire prefecture's towns and villages immediately burst into joy. The poor and lower-middle peasants of all ethnic groups immediately left their bamboo houses, beating drums and gongs, enthusiastically cheering. The Jingpo people in Mengsong Township spontaneously lit lanterns and torches, carrying portraits of Chairman Mao, holding up Chairman Mao's revolutionary books and quotations, crossing mountains and villages, holding parades, enthusiastically cheering the release of the communiqué, and quickly spreading this great news. The parade, like a long dragon of fire, moved from one hill to another, from one village to another. The revolutionary committee of Bada District in Menghai County printed the communiqué overnight, and the Dai propaganda team in the district quickly spread this great news to the villages where the Lahu and Dai people live.

That night, the entire prefecture echoed with cheers, and a wave of propaganda, celebration, and study swept across the entire prefecture. After studying the communiqué, the Dai poor and lower-middle peasants of Dongfanghong Commune in Jinghong County said, "The communiqué speaks to our hearts. We firmly support it." The chairman of Dongfanghong Cooperative in Mengsong Township, A Zhen, studied while recalling past sufferings and present joys. He said, "In the past, we Jingpo people were exploited by the Kuomintang reactionaries and local tyrants, working as slaves and beasts of burden all year round, even deprived of the right to live as humans. Because I couldn't pay the rent, the headman drove me out of the village, forcing me to spend five whole years in the deep mountains and dense forests. After liberation, Chairman Mao led us on the socialist road, but Liu Shaoqi, this traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader, and his agents in Yunnan, dared to say that 'the conditions for minorities to form cooperatives are not ripe,' slashing cooperatives and promoting individual farming, attempting to let the local tyrants trample us again. We Jingpo people, following the course set by Chairman Mao, resisted this countercurrent and greatly changed the face of poverty and backwardness. Today, this harmful creature Liu Shaoqi is thoroughly finished, which is a great relief to our hearts and fulfills the wishes of the Jingpo people, lifting the hatred from our hearts."

While studying the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Twelfth Central Committee of the Party, the people of all ethnic groups in the Dai Autonomous Prefecture had so much to say to Chairman Mao! They excitedly said, "Thousands of words condense into one voice: Dearest Chairman Mao, the hearts of all ethnic groups in our borderlands beat for you! Our hearts are loyal to you! We will resolutely follow you, march forward bravely, and vow to turn every village in our borderlands into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought, building an iron wall to defend our great socialist motherland."

    春风吹遍云南边疆
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报，象一阵强劲的春风，吹遍了云南边疆西双版纳傣族自治州，吹到了澜沧江畔傣族、拉祜族、僾伲族等各族人民的心田。各族人民用最美好的赞歌歌颂毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。
    十一月一日晚上，西双版纳傣族自治州各族人民从广播里收听了全会公报以后，整个自治州的城镇和村寨顿时欢腾起来。各族贫下中农立即走出竹楼，敲锣打鼓，热情欢呼。僾伲人居住的孟宋乡的贫下中农，不约而同地点燃了灯笼、火把，抬着毛主席画像，高举毛主席的革命宝书和语录牌，翻山岭，串村寨，举行游行，热烈欢呼公报的发表，迅速传播这个特大的喜讯。游行队伍象一条长长的火龙，从这个山头走向另一个山头，从这个村寨宣传到另一个村寨。勐海县八达区革命委员会连夜翻印公报，区里的傣族宣传队连夜用最快的速度，把这个大喜报传送到拉祜族、傣族等各族人民居住的村寨。
    这天晚上，全自治州欢呼声不绝，全州掀起了宣传、庆祝、学习的热潮。景洪县东方红公社傣族贫下中农学习了全会公报以后说，公报句句说出了我们的心里话。我们坚决拥护。孟宋乡东方红合作社社长阿甄一边学习，一边进行忆苦思甜。他说，我们僾伲人过去受国民党反动派和土司头人的压榨，成年累月当奴隶，做牛马，连做人的权利也被他们剥夺了。因为我缴不起租税，头人把我赶出寨子，逼得我在深山密林里整整度过了五个年头。解放后，毛主席领导我们走社会主义道路，可是刘少奇这个叛徒、内奸、工贼和他在云南的代理人，却狗胆包天，胡说什么“少数民族办合作社的条件不成熟”，大砍合作社，大刮单干风，妄图让土司头人重新把我们踩在脚底下。我们僾伲人沿着毛主席指引的航向，顶住了这股逆流，极大地改变了贫穷落后的面貌。今天，刘少奇这个害人虫彻底完蛋了，真是大快人心，实现了我们僾伲人的心愿，解了我们僾伲人心头的恨。
    傣族自治州各族人民在学习党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的时候，有多少贴心的话要对毛主席讲啊！他们激动地说，千言万语凝结成一个心声：最敬爱的毛主席啊，我们边疆各族人民颗颗红心向着您！颗颗红心忠于您！我们坚决紧跟您奋勇前进，誓把我们边疆每一个村寨办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校，建设成为保卫伟大社会主义祖国的铜墙铁壁。
