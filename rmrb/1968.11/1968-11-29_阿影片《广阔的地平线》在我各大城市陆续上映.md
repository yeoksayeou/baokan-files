The film "Broad Horizons" from Albania is premiering in major cities across China.

Xinhua News Agency, November 27th: To celebrate the 24th anniversary of Albania's liberation, the Albanian feature film "Broad Horizons" has been completed by our country's dubbing team. Starting today, it will be shown in the capital and major cities nationwide.

"Broad Horizons" is based on the heroic deeds of Adam Reka, a communist warrior from Albania. The film successfully portrays the heroic Albanian working class, who stand at the forefront of Europe's anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle, under the leadership of the Labor Party headed by the great Marxist-Leninist Enver Hoxha. It showcases their leadership role in the thriving revolutionary movement.

The protagonist of the film, Uran, is an excellent worker on the floating crane at the port of Durres. The film begins with a scene of Labor Party member Uran jumping into the sea to rescue a drowning sailor, Azim, demonstrating his selfless and heroic qualities. Subsequent scenes depict Uran and his comrades daring to think, speak, and act, breaking through unreasonable regulations and fighting against conservative ideologies. These scenes illustrate the boundless loyalty of this glorious Labor Party member and his comrades to the party and the people, as well as their selfless revolutionary spirit. In a critical moment when a storm threatens the safety of the hundred-ton floating crane, Uran steps forward, bravely rescues the situation, and sacrifices his young life for the party, the people, and the cause of socialism. The Albanian working class takes great pride in the fact that the Labor Party has nurtured such heroic sons for the people.

Through this film, the Chinese people will gain a deeper understanding of the great victories achieved by Albania's revolutionary movement, and will be greatly inspired.
