Last November, our An-tu County Shi-men Commune Bei-da Brigade in Yan-bian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, Jilin, took over the management of the public primary school from the commune and ran it ourselves. Over the past year, we have deeply felt that Chairman Mao's great teaching on "in the countryside, schools should be run by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants" is extremely wise and correct.

After we poor and lower-middle peasants took control of rural education, we thoroughly criticized the revisionist educational line, established an educational revolution leadership group with the brigade revolutionary committee members as the core, and implemented a "nine-year continuous" system for primary and secondary schools. To truly open the school doors to the children of the poor and lower-middle peasants, the educational revolution leadership group decided that children could attend school regardless of age, and the brigade would cover all tuition, book fees, and heating fees.

Over the past year, we have also felt that we must follow Chairman Mao's teaching on "the most important thing is to select principals and teachers and determine the educational policy," and focus on the ideological transformation of teachers. Managing the school starts with managing people, and managing people starts with managing their ideology. The production brigade actively organized teachers to participate in the class struggle in the production teams, go to the production teams to engage in collective labor, hold study sessions with the community members, criticize and repudiate revisionism together, and criticize the revisionist educational line. After thorough preparation, teachers no longer receive state salaries but are evaluated and paid like community members. To better control rural education, we selected seven outstanding poor and lower-middle peasant community members to enter the school and stand on the lectern; school teachers were sent in batches to the production teams to work and obtain community member status before returning to teach. In this way, the gap between teachers and community members gradually narrowed, and their feelings grew closer, laying the foundation for building a new type of teacher team.

Over the past year, we have also felt that we must follow Chairman Mao's teaching on cultivating "socialist-conscious, cultured laborers," be bold and revolutionary, and thoroughly smash the bourgeois framework, destroy the old school's "intellectual education first," "grades first," and other revisionist junk, and abolish all bourgeois rules and regulations. Now, students study Chairman Mao's works, read the genealogy of the proletariat. In addition, courses such as medicine, veterinary medicine, masonry, carpentry, tractor operation, fruit cultivation, and accounting have been added. Over the past year, we have trained more than seventy professionals who understand class struggle and have practical skills. Such trained students speak the truth, are reliable in their work, and are successors that Chairman Mao and the poor and lower-middle peasants are satisfied with.

Over the past year, we have also deeply felt that we must follow Chairman Mao's teaching on thrift in all undertakings, be self-reliant, and run schools in a thrifty manner, following the path of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University. We severely criticized the idea of running Western-style schools and showing off. When the school buildings were damaged, we repaired them ourselves; when there were not enough desks and chairs, we made them ourselves. The brigade's carpenters and students repaired and made more than one hundred desks and chairs and repaired more than fifty doors and windows. Students combined studying with farming and learned both industry and agriculture. This year, our brigade bought a tractor, and it was driven by a tractor operator trained by our school to plow the fields. We poor and lower-middle peasants are overjoyed. Such trained students will not forget their roots, will not turn into revisionists, and will always be of one mind with us.

    “敢”字当头，砸烂资产阶级“正规化”的框框
    去年十一月，我们吉林延边朝鲜族自治州安图县石门公社北山大队，把公办小学改由大队来办。一年来我们深深体会到，毛主席关于“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校”的伟大教导，是非常英明，非常正确的。
    我们贫下中农掌握了农村教育大权后，大造了修正主义教育路线的反，成立了以大队革委会领导成员为核心的教育革命领导小组，实行了中小学“九年一贯制”。为了真正向贫下中农子女敞开校门，教育革命领导小组决定，孩子上学不受年龄限制，学杂费、书费、取暖费由大队全部包下来。
    一年来的实践，我们还体会到，必须遵照毛主席关于“最重要的问题，是选择校长教员和规定教育方针”的教导，狠抓教师的思想革命化。管学校先管人，管人先管思想。生产大队积极组织教员参加生产队的对敌斗争，到生产队参加集体生产劳动，同社员一起办学习班，一起斗私批修，一起批判修正主义教育路线。经过充分酝酿以后，教员不拿国家工资，和社员一样评工记分。为了更好地掌握农村教育大权，我们选拔了七名优秀的贫下中农社员开进了学校，登上了讲台；学校教员实行了分期分批到生产队劳动，取得社员资格以后，再回学校当教员。这样，教员和社员之间的鸿沟逐渐填平了，感情也越来越接近了，为建立起一支新型的教师队伍打下了基础。
    一年来的实践，我们还体会到，必须按照毛主席培养“有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”的教导，“敢”字当头，“革”字当头，彻底砸烂资产阶级洋框框，摧毁旧学校的“智育第一”“分数挂帅”等等修正主义黑货，把资产阶级的陈规旧章等统统废除掉。现在，学生学的是毛主席著作，读的是无产阶级家谱。此外还增设了医师、兽医、瓦工、木工、拖拉机、果木、会计等课目，一年来共培养了既懂得阶级斗争又有实践的各种专业人材七十多名。这样培养出来的学生说话实在，办事牢靠，是毛主席放心、贫下中农满意的好接班人。
    一年来的实践，我们也深深体会到，必须遵照毛主席关于勤俭办一切事业的教导，自力更生，勤俭办学，走抗大式的道路。我们狠狠地批判了那种办洋学堂、摆阔气的思想。校舍坏了自己修，桌椅不够自己动手做，大队的木工和学生修理、新做了一百条桌椅，修门窗五十多个。学生做到了读书兼种地，学工也学农。今年我们大队买来一台拖拉机，就是由我们学校自己培养出来的拖拉机手驾驶翻地，我们贫下中农打心眼里往外高兴。这样培养出来的学生，忘不了本，变不了修，永远和我们一个心眼。
