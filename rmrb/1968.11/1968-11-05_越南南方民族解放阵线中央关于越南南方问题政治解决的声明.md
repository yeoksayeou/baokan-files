The Central Committee of the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam on the Political Settlement of the South Vietnamese Issue

	New China News Agency, Hanoi, November 3rd: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam today issued a declaration on the political settlement of the South Vietnamese issue. This declaration was broadcast by the Liberation News Agency, and the full text is as follows:

	Declaration of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam on the Political Settlement of the South Vietnamese Issue

	For fourteen years, the United States imperialists have attempted to turn South Vietnam into a new colonial and military base for the United States, carrying out the most brutal policy of aggression against the Vietnamese people in history, and grossly violating the independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of Vietnam recognized in the 1954 Geneva Agreements.

	The United States imperialists have set up a highly brutal puppet regime in South Vietnam, attempting to force the people of South Vietnam to endure their rule through iron and fire.

	However, the people of South Vietnam have united as one, with a single heart and mind, bravely rising up to wage a fierce and unyielding struggle against the aggressors and traitors. Under the glorious banner of the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam, the sacred resistance of the South Vietnamese people has received the full-hearted support of their fellow countrymen in the North and the resolute, powerful sympathy and support of the governments of friendly countries and the people of the world, achieving ever-greater victories.

	To save itself from complete collapse, the United States imperialists have dispatched a large number of their expeditionary forces to directly invade South Vietnam, while also waging a destructive war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, committing countless barbaric crimes in both the North and the South.

	However, no amount of brutality can save the United States aggressors and their puppets from their heavy defeat!

	The people and soldiers of the North have fought with unparalleled bravery, shooting down more than 3,200 American aircraft, defeating the United States' destructive war, and fulfilling their duty to support the front lines from the rear.

	The people and soldiers of the South have thwarted all plans by the United States to intensify the war of aggression and, since the beginning of this year, have launched continuous attacks and united struggles, striking the United States and its puppets with thunderous blows in their various strongholds, achieving unprecedented great victories in all aspects, changing the situation of the war, and making the United States and its puppets increasingly fall into a passive and collapsing situation, unable to recover.

	Facing the brave and tenacious struggle of our entire people and the significant victories achieved in all aspects, under the strong demand of the people of the world, including the progressive people of the United States, the United States government was forced to accept and implement the unconditional cessation of bombing and attacks on all the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This is a tremendous victory for our entire people and the peace-loving people of the world.

	However, the United States imperialists have not abandoned their ambitions to invade Vietnam. They continue to stubbornly strengthen the war in South Vietnam, tightly holding onto the puppet regime, attempting to maintain their neo-colonial rule in South Vietnam and long-term division of our country. They continue to stubbornly carry out actions that violate the sovereignty and security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. They continue to demand that our people must pay a price for their cessation of destructive warfare in the North.

	The people of South Vietnam and the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam firmly demand that the United States must permanently cease all actions that violate the sovereignty and security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, must stop the war of aggression in South Vietnam, and implement all the guarantees made by the United States at the 1954 Geneva Conference on the Vietnamese issue, respecting the inviolable national rights of the people of South Vietnam.

	The people of South Vietnam love peace, but it must be peace based on independence and freedom. To express this wish and resolve, the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam, based on its political program, solemnly declares its position on the political settlement of the South Vietnamese issue as follows:

	1. South Vietnam is determined to struggle for its sacred rights—independence, democracy, peace, neutrality, and prosperity—and to achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

	2. The United States imperialists must stop the war of aggression in Vietnam, withdraw all U.S. troops, mercenary troops, and their various war tools from South Vietnam, and dismantle all U.S. military bases in South Vietnam.

	3. The internal affairs of South Vietnam must be resolved by the South Vietnamese people without foreign interference, based on the political program of the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam. A broad national and democratic united government must be established; free and general elections must be held in South Vietnam.

	4. The reunification of the Vietnamese nation will be gradually resolved through peaceful means, based on discussions and agreements between the North and the South, without foreign interference.

	5. South Vietnam will pursue a policy of peace and neutrality in foreign affairs: it will not enter into any form of military alliance with any foreign country; it will establish friendly relations with all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. It will establish friendly and neighborly relations with the Kingdom of Cambodia on the basis of respecting Cambodia's independence, sovereignty, neutrality, and territorial integrity within its existing borders, and with Laos on the basis of respecting the 1962 Geneva Agreements on the Laotian issue.

	The United States imperialists are the aggressors in South Vietnam. The National Liberation Front for South Vietnam is the organization and leader of the South Vietnamese people's resistance against the U.S. aggressors and their achievements of one victory after another. The National Liberation Front is building and developing the revolutionary government of the South Vietnamese people. Many governments and people of the world have recognized the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam and have provided it with great support and assistance. The National Liberation Front for South Vietnam is the true representative of the legitimate aspirations of the South Vietnamese people and has the full authority to resolve all issues related to South Vietnam.

	The National Liberation Front for South Vietnam reaffirms its complete support for and agreement with the four-point proposal of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. These proposals reflect the wishes and will of our entire people and are the correct basis for resolving the Vietnamese issue.

	In the situation where the United States has unconditionally stopped bombing and attacking North Vietnam, the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam firmly supports the position explained in the declaration issued by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on November 2, 1968, aimed at seeking a political solution to the Vietnamese issue. After discussing and reaching a consensus with the Central Committee of the National and Democratic Forces Alliance of Vietnam, the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam agrees to participate in the four-party conference including the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam, the United States, and the Saigon regime; the representative of the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam will speak for the voice of the South Vietnamese people—the voice of justice—at this conference.

	The current Saigon regime is merely a group of traitors serving as the running dogs of the U.S. aggressors, and it goes against the legitimate wishes of all the people of South Vietnam. They have been firmly opposed by our people and despised by the progressive people of the world. They do not represent anyone! The participation of the Saigon regime's representatives in the aforementioned conference does not mean that the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam recognizes this regime.

	The failure of the United States is already apparent, but it has not yet abandoned its ambitions to invade Vietnam. The closer the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against the United States approaches victory, the more difficulties there will be. All South Vietnamese compatriots and soldiers of the people's liberation armed forces enthusiastically respond to the sacred call of Chairman Hu on November 3, 1968, to strengthen their resolve and continue to fight unyieldingly until they achieve the final victory.

	“As long as there is still one aggressor on our land, we will continue to fight and drive them all out.” We must raise the banner of victory, advance bravely, and carry on the momentum of continuous attacks and continuous struggles, defeat the U.S. war of aggression, overthrow the traitorous and sellout clique, seize all power back into the hands of the people, and gloriously fulfill the sacred duty of liberating the South, defending the North, and achieving the peaceful reunification of the motherland, contributing to the maintenance of peace in Asia and the world!

	Soldiers of the puppet army and personnel of the puppet regime must quickly recognize the situation, return to the embrace of the motherland and the people, and wage a struggle to save the country, save the family, and save themselves, opposing the U.S. aggressors and their running dogs! The National Liberation Front and compatriots are always ready to welcome you.

	The Central Committee of the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam appeals to the governments of all countries, organizations, democrats, and progressive people of the world, including the progressive people of the United States, to strongly support the correct position of the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam and to more actively assist the South Vietnamese people's war of resistance against the United States until they achieve complete victory.

	South Vietnam will definitely be liberated!

	The Vietnamese people's war of resistance against the United States will definitely be victorious!

	November 3, 1968, in South Vietnam

    越南南方民族解放阵线中央关于越南南方问题政治解决的声明
    新华社河内三日电　据越南通讯社报道，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会今天发表一个关于越南南方问题的政治解决的声明。这个声明由解放通讯社播发，全文如下：
    越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会关于越南南方问题的政治解决的声明
    十四年来，美帝国主义妄图实现把越南南方变为美国新型殖民地和军事基地的阴谋，推行了历史上最残暴的反对越南人民的侵略政策，粗暴地践踏了一九五四年日内瓦协议所公认的越南的独立、主权、统一和领土完整。
    美帝国主义在越南南方扶植了一个极其残暴的走狗政权，妄图用铁和火迫使越南南方人民忍受它们的统治。
    但是越南南方人民团结一致，万众一心，英勇奋起，同侵略者和卖国贼进行了激烈和坚持不懈的斗争。在越南南方民族解放阵线的光荣旗帜下，越南南方人民的神圣的抗战得到了北方同胞的全心全力的支援，并得到了各友好国家政府和全世界人民的坚决的、强有力的同情和支持，不断取得日益巨大的胜利。
    美帝国主义为了挽救它的彻底崩溃，大规模地派遣了它的远征军直接侵略越南南方，同时对越南民主共和国进行了破坏性战争，在越南南北两方到处犯下了无数的野蛮罪行。
    但是，任何残暴的力量都挽救不了美国侵略者及其走狗的惨重失败！
    北方军民进行了无比英勇的战斗，击落了三千二百多架美国飞机，打败了美国的破坏性战争，完成了大后方对大前线的义务。
    南方军民挫败了美国强化侵略战争的一切计划，并且从今年初春以来，连续发起进攻和一致奋起斗争，就在美国及其走狗的各个巢穴里给予它们以雷霆般的打击，在各个方面都取得了空前巨大的胜利，改变了战争的局面，使美国及其走狗日益深陷于被动和崩溃的处境，一蹶不振。
    面对着我全国军民英勇顽强的斗争和在各个方面所取得的具有重大意义的胜利，在包括美国进步人民在内的世界人民的强烈要求下，美国政府被迫接受和实现无条件地停止对越南民主共和国全部领土的轰炸和袭击。这是我们全国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的极其巨大的胜利。
    然而，美帝国主义并没有放弃侵略越南的野心。它仍然顽固地加强在越南南方的战争，紧紧抓住走狗伪政权不放，妄图维持它在越南南方的新殖民主义的统治并长期分割我国。它仍然顽固地继续进行侵犯越南民主共和国主权和安全的行动。它仍然要求我国人民必须对它停止在北方进行破坏性战争付出代价。
    越南南方人民和越南南方民族解放阵线坚决要求美国必须永远放弃侵犯越南民主共和国主权和安全的一切行动，必须停止侵略越南南方的战争，实现美国在一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦会议上所作的一切保证，尊重越南南方人民不可侵犯的各项民族权利。
    越南南方人民十分爱好和平，但必须是在独立、自由基础上的和平。为了表达这种愿望和决心，越南南方民族解放阵线根据自己的政治纲领，就越南南方问题的政治解决办法的立场郑重声明如下：
    一、越南南方决心为实现自己的神圣权利——独立、民主、和平、中立和繁荣，进而和平统一祖国而奋斗。
    二、美帝国主义必须停止侵越战争，把美军、帮凶军以及它们的各种战争工具全部撤出越南南方，撤除美国在越南南方的一切军事基地。
    三、越南南方的内部事务必须由南方人民在没有外国干涉的情况下，根据越南南方民族解放阵线的政治纲领自行解决。成立广泛的民族、民主联合政府；在越南南方举行自由普选。
    四、越南国家的统一，将在南北两方之间进行讨论和协商一致的基础上，由越南南北两方人民在没有外国干涉的情况下，通过和平方法逐步解决。
    五、越南南方奉行和平中立的外交政策：不同外国缔结任何形式的军事联盟；在和平共处五项原则的基础上同所有国家建立友好关系。在尊重柬埔寨的独立、主权、中立和现有边界线内的领土完整的基础上同柬埔寨王国建立友好睦邻关系，在尊重一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议的基础上同老挝建立友好睦邻关系。
    美帝国主义是对越南南方的侵略者。越南南方民族解放阵线是越南南方人民抗击美国侵略者并取得一个又一个胜利的组织者和领导者。民族解放阵线正在建立和发展越南南方人民的革命政权。许多国家政府和世界人民已经承认越南南方民族解放阵线，并且给予民族解放阵线以巨大的支持和援助。越南南方民族解放阵线是南方人民的各种正当愿望的真正代表者，具有充分的权威解决同越南南方有关的各项问题。
    越南南方民族解放阵线重申完全赞同和支持越南民主共和国政府的四项主张。这些主张体现了我全国人民的愿望和意志，是解决越南问题的正确基础。
    在美国已经无条件地停止对越南北方的轰炸和袭击的情况下，越南南方民族解放阵线坚决支持越南民主共和国政府在一九六八年十一月二日发表的旨在为越南问题寻求政治解决办法的声明中所阐明的立场。越南南方民族解放阵线在同越南民族、民主及和平力量联盟中央委员会讨论并取得一致意见之后，同意参加包括越南民主共和国、越南南方民族解放阵线、美国和西贡政权的四方会议；越南南方民族解放阵线的代表将在这个会议上说出南方人民的声音——正义的声音。
    现在的西贡政权，只不过是一群充当美国侵略者走狗的卖国贼，它违背了全体越南南方人民的正当愿望。它们遭到了我国人民的坚决反对和世界进步人民的唾弃。它们代表不了任何人！西贡政权的代表参加上述会议，并不意味着越南南方民族解放阵线承认这个政权。
    美国的失败已经是明显的了，但是它仍没有放弃侵略越南的野心。越南人民的抗美战争越接近胜利，困难就越多。全体南方同胞和人民解放武装力量战士热烈响应胡主席一九六八年十一月三日的神圣号召，要增强决心，坚持不懈地战斗，直到取得最后胜利，
  “只要在我国土地上还有一个侵略者，我们就要继续战斗，把它全部赶出去”。要高举胜利的旗帜，勇猛前进，发扬连续进攻和连续奋起斗争的气势，打败美国的侵略战争，打倒越奸卖国集团，把全部政权夺回到人民手中，光荣地完成解放南方、保卫北方、进而和平统一祖国的神圣义务，为维护亚洲和世界和平作出贡献！
    伪军士兵和伪政权机构人员，必须及时认清形势，回到祖国和人民的怀抱，进行救国、救家、救自己的斗争，反对美国侵略者及其走狗！民族解放阵线和同胞随时准备欢迎你们。
    越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会呼吁全世界各国政府、各个组织、民主人士和包括美国进步人民在内的全世界进步人民，强有力地支持越南南方民族解放阵线的正确立场，更加积极地援助越南南方人民的抗美救国战争，直到取得彻底胜利。
    越南南方一定要获得解放！
    越南人民的抗美救国事业一定胜利！
    一九六八年十一月三日　于越南南方
