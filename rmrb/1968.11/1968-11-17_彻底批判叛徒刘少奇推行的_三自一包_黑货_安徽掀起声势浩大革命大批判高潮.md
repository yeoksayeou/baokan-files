Poor and lower-middle peasants unanimously say that Liu Shaoqi relentlessly promoted "Three Selfs and One Package" and "responsibility fields," attempting to restore capitalism and make us suffer twice. This big villain is our sworn enemy, and we will resolutely criticize him thoroughly and expose his crimes.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, November 16th — Under the inspiration of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Anhui Province have launched a massive revolutionary criticism campaign. They angrily denounce the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Anhui, who frantically promoted "Three Selfs and One Package," "responsibility fields," and other counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods in Anhui's rural areas. They are determined to thoroughly eliminate all his poisonous influences and turn Anhui's rural areas into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

After the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee was issued, Anhui Province, from the Huaihe Plain to the Dabie Mountains, from the shores of Lake Chaohu to the banks of the Xin'an River, all local revolutionary committees dispatched large propaganda teams to rural and mountainous areas for propaganda. Various places extensively organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the content of studying and implementing the great combat tasks proposed in the communiqué. A wave of studying, propagating, and implementing the communiqué quickly swept across the rural areas of the entire province. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants studied the communiqué word by word in the study classes. Through studying the communiqué, they loved the great leader Chairman Mao even more deeply and hated the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi even more intensely. Filled with class hatred, they set up revolutionary criticism battlefields in the fields and by the roadsides, fiercely exposing and criticizing Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Anhui for promoting "Three Selfs and One Package," "responsibility fields," and "work points as the commander" and other counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants unanimously said that Liu Shaoqi relentlessly promoted "Three Selfs and One Package" and "responsibility fields" in Anhui, attempting to restore capitalism and make us suffer twice. This big villain is our sworn enemy, and we will resolutely criticize him thoroughly and expose his crimes.

Some poor and lower-middle peasants in communes and production brigades angrily exposed and denounced the disasters brought by Liu Shaoqi and his agents promoting "Three Selfs and One Package" and "responsibility fields" at criticism meetings. A poor peasant from Xiaobangbu Commune in the suburbs of Bengbu City, Wu Yanhai, said that a small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party, following the black orders of the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi, used their usurped power to forcibly promote "responsibility fields" and "Three Selfs and One Package" here. Landlords and rich peasants were especially active and rampant. In our brigade, there is a landlord surnamed Wu who "overproduced" more than a thousand yuan in a year while promoting "responsibility fields"; a poor peasant, due to having less labor power and other reasons, ended up owing more than one hundred and eighty yuan. The dog landlord proudly said, "I was happy in the past, and I am still happy now." From this, it can be seen whom Liu Shaoqi's "Three Selfs and One Package" and "responsibility fields" are serving! This fact also best explains that Liu Shaoqi, this big villain, is a faithful running dog of imperialism, revisionism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Daqin Commune in Suzhou County also exposed that local capitalist roaders, following the black orders of their master Liu Shaoqi, concocted a poisonous weed called "Ten Superiorities of Responsibility Fields," falsely claiming that "responsibility fields" are a new development of Marxism-Leninism. The poor and lower-middle peasants said that this is indeed turning right into left and confusing black with white. "Responsibility fields" are fields for restoring capitalism, sweet for landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and bitter for poor and lower-middle peasants.

After thoroughly criticizing "Three Selfs and One Package," "responsibility fields," and "work points as the commander" and other revisionist black goods, the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants in many places has soared to an unprecedented height, and their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines has been further enhanced. Many production brigades have taken the road of emphasizing proletarian politics and implemented the labor management methods of Dazhai. The entire province's rural areas have universally launched a wave of seizing revolution and promoting production. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are determined to achieve even greater harvests in agricultural production and welcome the convening of the Ninth National Congress of the Party.

　　彻底批判叛徒刘少奇推行的“三自一包”黑货
　　安徽掀起声势浩大革命大批判高潮
    贫下中农异口同声地说，刘少奇拚命推行“三自一包”“责任田”，妄图复辟资本主义，让我们吃二遍苦。这个大坏蛋是我们不共戴天的仇人，我们坚决把他批透、批臭
    新华社合肥十六日电　安徽省广大贫下中农，在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报鼓舞下，掀起了一个声势浩大的革命大批判高潮，他们愤怒声讨叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其在安徽的代理人，在安徽农村疯狂推行“三自一包”、“责任田”等反革命修正主义黑货的滔天罪行，决心彻底肃清其一切流毒，把安徽农村办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    党的八届十二中全会公报发表后，安徽省从淮北平原到大别山区，从巢湖湖滨到新安江畔，各地区革委会都派出了大批宣传队，深入农村、山区进行宣传。各地普遍举办了以学习、落实全会公报提出的各项伟大战斗任务为内容的毛泽东思想学习班，在全省农村迅速出现了学习、宣传、落实公报的热潮。广大贫下中农在学习班上逐字逐句地学习公报，通过对公报的学习，他们对伟大领袖毛主席更加无限热爱，对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇更加无比愤恨。他们满怀阶级仇恨，在田头、地边摆开了革命大批判的战场，大揭狠批刘少奇及其在安徽的代理人推行“三自一包”、“责任田”、“工分挂帅”等反革命修正主义黑货的滔天罪行。广大贫下中农异口同声地说，刘少奇在安徽拚命推行“三自一包”、“责任田”，妄图复辟资本主义，让我们吃二遍苦，受二遍罪。这个大坏蛋是我们不共戴天的仇人，我们要坚决把他批透、批臭。
    一些社、队的贫下中农在批判会上愤怒地揭发、控诉了刘少奇及其代理人推行“三自一包”、“责任田”给贫下中农带来的灾难。蚌埠市郊小蚌埠公社贫农社员吴延海说，党内一小撮走资派秉承叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的黑旨意，利用他们窃踞的权力，在我们这里强迫推行“责任田”、“三自一包”时，地主、富农特别活跃，特别猖狂。我们队有个姓吴的地主，在推行“责任田”时，他一年就得“超产”金额一千多元；有个贫农却因劳力少等原因，年终赔了一百八十多元，狗地主得意洋洋地说：“过去我快活，现在还是我快活。”从这一点就可以看出刘少奇推行的“三自一包”、“责任田”究竟是为谁服务的！这一事实也最好地说明了刘少奇这个大坏蛋，道道地地是帝国主义、修正主义、国民党反动派的一条忠实走狗。宿县大秦公社的贫下中农，还揭发了当地的走资派，秉承其黑主子刘少奇的旨意，炮制了大毒草“责任田的十大优越性”，胡说“责任田”“是马列主义的新发展”。贫下中农们说，这真是颠倒是非，混淆黑白。“责任田”是资本主义复辟田，甜的是地富反坏右，苦的是贫下中农。
    很多地方通过彻底批判“三自一包”、“责任田”、“工分挂帅”等修正主义黑货后，广大社员社会主义积极性空前高涨，阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟进一步提高。不少生产队走突出无产阶级政治的道路，实行了大寨式劳动管理办法。全省农村普遍掀起了抓革命、促生产的高潮，广大贫下中农决心夺取农业生产的更大丰收，迎接党的第九次全国代表大会的召开。
