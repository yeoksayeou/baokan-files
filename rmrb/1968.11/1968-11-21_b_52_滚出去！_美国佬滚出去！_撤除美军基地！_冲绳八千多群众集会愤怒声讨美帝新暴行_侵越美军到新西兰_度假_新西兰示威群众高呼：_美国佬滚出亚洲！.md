“Get out, B-52s!” “Yankees, go home!” “Remove U.S. military bases!”

Thousands of Okinawans gather to condemn new U.S. atrocities

U.S. troops invading Vietnam “vacation” in New Zealand; protesters shout: “Yankees, get out of Asia!”

	BEIJING, Nov. 20 (Xinhua) — TOKYO — More than 8,000 people from various walks of life in Okinawa gathered on the evening of the 19th in the village of Kadena to strongly protest the serious harm caused to local residents by the explosion of a U.S. B-52 bomber. They resolutely demanded the withdrawal of U.S. military bases and the return of Okinawa.

	The participants in the rally included not only residents of Kadena but also many workers and residents from nearby villages. They carried placards reading “Get out, B-52s!” “Yankees, go home!” “Remove U.S. military bases!” and “Immediately and unconditionally return Okinawa!” as they entered the venue. The entire rally was filled with a combative atmosphere of condemning U.S. imperialist atrocities.

	A worker representative firmly declared at the rally: “We will fight to the end until the U.S. withdraws its military bases!”

	The rally adopted a declaration and resolution demanding that the U.S. immediately withdraw its B-52 bombers from Okinawa and remove its military bases, and expressing the determination to recover Okinawa.

	The rally ended with the singing of the stirring song “Return Our Okinawa.”

	On the same evening, more than 300 young students held a rally in a square near the Kadena base, shouting anti-U.S. slogans and holding a demonstration march. The students demanded the smashing of the U.S.-Japan “Security Treaty,” the removal of U.S. military bases, and the return of Okinawa.

	The U.S.-Japan reactionaries were terrified by the protesters and immediately dispatched a large number of armed police to brutally suppress the demonstrators, injuring many people and arbitrarily arresting one protester. At the same time, officials from the Sato government’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs hurriedly issued a statement on the 19th, blustering that the B-52 bombers stationed in Okinawa were for “guaranteeing” the “security” of the Far East, so the Sato reactionary government “does not intend to request the withdrawal of B-52 bombers” and so on, thereby once again exposing the ugly face of the Sato reactionary government as a henchman of U.S. imperialism.

	The fascist actions of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries further enraged the residents of Okinawa and the broad masses of the Japanese people, who are now launching a fierce struggle to protest against the fascist atrocities of the U.S. occupiers and the Sato reactionary government.

	WELLINGTON, Nov. 20 (Xinhua) — A group of people in Wellington, the capital of New Zealand, held a demonstration at the dock on the 19th to protest against U.S. troops invading Vietnam “vacationing” on the U.S. aircraft carrier “America.”

	When the U.S. invading troops came ashore, the demonstrators set up a picket line at the dock to express their protest. The demonstrators held up placards reading “Yankees, get out of Asia!” and “The U.S. and its allies must immediately get out of Vietnam!” The demonstrators also distributed leaflets. The leaflets strongly demanded the withdrawal of U.S. invading troops and other accomplices from Vietnam and supported the people of South Vietnam in continuing their struggle until the last U.S. invader is driven out.

	After the U.S. warship arrived in Wellington, leaflets and placards were posted all over the city, reading: “Yankees and New Zealand (soldiers) must immediately get out of Vietnam!” “The U.S. invaders will be defeated!”

    冲绳八千多群众集会愤怒声讨美帝新暴行
    侵越美军到新西兰“度假”　新西兰示威群众高呼：“美国佬滚出亚洲！”
    新华社二十日讯　东京消息：冲绳各阶层人民八千多人十九日晚上在嘉手纳村举行大会，强烈抗议由于美帝B—52型轰炸机爆炸给当地居民造成的严重危害，坚决要求撤除美军基地和收复冲绳。
    参加大会的群众，除嘉手纳村居民外，还有许多工人和邻近村庄的居民。他们举着“B—52滚出去！”“美国佬滚出去！”“撤除美国军事基地！”“立即全面无条件地归还冲绳！”等标语牌走进会场。整个大会充满着声讨美帝国主义暴行的战斗气氛。
    一个工人代表在大会上坚定地说：“我们一定要斗争到底，直到美帝撤除它的军事基地！”
    大会通过了宣言和决议，要求美帝立即从冲绳撤走B—52型轰炸机和撤除军事基地，并表示一定要收复冲绳。
    大会在高唱《还我冲绳》的雄壮歌声中结束。
    同一天晚上，三百多名青年学生在嘉手纳基地附近广场上集会，高呼反美口号，并举行了示威游行。学生们要求粉碎日美“安全条约”、撤除美国军事基地和收复冲绳。
    美日反动派被示威群众吓破了胆，立即出动大批武装警察野蛮镇压示威群众，打伤了许多人，并无理逮捕了一名示威者。与此同时，佐藤卖国政府外务省官员赶忙在十九日发表谈话，叫嚣什么驻扎在冲绳的美军B—52型轰炸机是为了“保障”远东的“安全”，所以佐藤反动政府“不打算要求美国撤除B—52型轰炸机”云云，从而再一次暴露了佐藤反动政府充当美帝帮凶的丑恶嘴脸。
    美日反动派的这些法西斯行为进一步激起了冲绳居民和日本广大人民的愤怒，他们正在开展猛烈的斗争，抗议美国占领者和佐藤反动政府的法西斯暴行。
    新华社惠灵顿二十日电　新西兰首都惠灵顿的一批群众，十九日在码头举行示威，抗议美国航空母舰“美利坚号”上的侵越美军到新西兰“度假”。
    当美国侵略军上岸时，示威者在码头上布置纠察线表示抗议。示威者高举着标语牌，上面写道：“美国佬滚出亚洲！”“美国及其盟国立即滚出越南！”示威者还散发了传单。传单强烈要求美国侵略军及其他帮凶军撤出越南，支持越南南方人民继续战斗，直到最后一个美国侵略者被赶出去为止。
    在美国军舰到达惠灵顿后，这个城市到处都张贴了传单和标语，上面写着：“美国佬和新西兰（士兵）立即滚出越南！”“美国侵略者必败！”
