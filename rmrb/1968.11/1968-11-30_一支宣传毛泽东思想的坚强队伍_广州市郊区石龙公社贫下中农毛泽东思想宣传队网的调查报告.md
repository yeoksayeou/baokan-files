In the great mass movement of the Cultural Revolution, Shilong Commune in the northern suburbs of Guangzhou established a force of over 3,700 people, based on the militia organization, dedicated to promoting Mao Zedong Thought among the poor and lower-middle peasants. All ten production brigades and 169 production teams in the commune have their own propaganda teams. On average, one in every seven people is a member of a propaganda team, forming a widespread network throughout the commune.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The spread of political propaganda in the countryside is a great achievement of the Communist Party and the peasant associations. Simple slogans, pictures, and speeches have made the peasants feel as if they have all attended a political school, with broad and rapid effects." The propaganda army of poor and lower-middle peasants in Shilong Commune has played such a role.

With boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, this force, with high political enthusiasm and a resolute and painstaking style, frequently and openly, yet practically, promotes and implements Chairman Mao's latest instructions, spreading the battle cries of the proletarian headquarters. They have made significant contributions to advancing the ideological revolution among the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, achieving a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, and widely promoting the great Mao Zedong Thought in the countryside. Now, from the market towns to the villages in this commune, every household, both inside and outside, can see the portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao. Every family has a copy of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." During the day, revolutionary songs echo through the fields, and at night, the village squares are alive with activity. Teams of Red Guards, carrying red flags and precious books, march through the alleys and houses, singing revolutionary songs and reciting Chairman Mao's quotations, conducting propaganda activities. On the fifth and tenth of every month, the members of each production team gather voluntarily to study Chairman Mao's works collectively. The "Three Loyalties" campaign—loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line—is being carried out vigorously, and the spiritual face of the commune members has undergone significant changes.

The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Network of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants in Shilong Commune has the following main characteristics and experiences:

Main Characteristics:

1. Swift and decisive action upon receiving Chairman Mao's latest instructions, spreading them widely and ensuring their implementation. Whenever Chairman Mao issues new instructions or the proletarian headquarters issues new battle cries, day or night, the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams of the poor and lower-middle peasants quickly spread the word to every village and household. Thus, the over 20,000 people in the entire commune can promptly hear Chairman Mao's voice and the battle cries of the proletarian headquarters. Before the broadcast of the communiqué of the enlarged 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee, chaired by Chairman Mao, the propaganda teams, based on the radio's announcement, organized commune members to listen to the wired broadcast. Within an hour, over 6,000 people rushed to the commune to participate in the celebration rally and parade for the issuance of the communiqué. The entire commune was filled with the sound of drums and gongs, and cheers echoed everywhere, creating a wave of enthusiasm for the communiqué.

Based on the widespread promotion of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the propaganda teams, under the unified leadership of the commune revolutionary committee, organize study classes, give lectures, and hold discussion meetings to ensure that all commune members repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions. At the same time, they focus on implementation. Under the unified organization of the commune revolutionary committee, the propaganda teams go to production teams and commune-enterprise units where class struggle is most intense. They study, work, and recall bitterness together with the revolutionary masses in these units, raising the class consciousness of the masses and uncovering the lid of class struggle. The masses praise them for their quick promotion, good implementation, and practical actions, saying, "They don't just talk; they follow through."

2. Skilled in addressing living thoughts, conducting regular political and ideological work, and promoting the ideological revolution among the commune members. This propaganda team in Shilong Commune is also a powerful political and ideological work team. The masses praise their work for being thorough in two ways: closely linking it with various tasks and deeply penetrating every household, ensuring that ideological work reaches every individual. Under the guidance of the propaganda teams, Shilong Commune has seen a lively and vibrant political atmosphere, with a strong focus on revolution and production.

3. Widely using artistic forms to promote Mao Zedong Thought and occupy the cultural front in the countryside. Whenever Chairman Mao issues new instructions, many propaganda teams can quickly create and rehearse artistic performances to accompany the promotion. Now, brigade propaganda teams generally have 30 to 80 small performances ready to be performed at any time. These artistic performances have a strong political atmosphere and combativeness, closely aligning with the current struggles. Recently, the propaganda team of Yangshan Brigade created and performed the song and dance drama "Never Forget Class Bitterness" based on the history of the village's suffering under Japanese invasion. After the performance in Xiaoshi Village, it strongly influenced and educated the masses, turning the artistic performance evening into a denunciation meeting of the old society.

4. Setting an example of leading by example and striving hard. In the production teams, they are the first to start work and the last to finish. They voluntarily take on the heaviest and dirtiest farm work. During the summer harvest this year, more than 20 mu of ripe rice in the 12th production team of Brigade 8 were submerged in water. The propaganda team members, guided by Chairman Mao's teachings of "making a firm decision, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," led the way into the water, diving into the deepest parts of the fields to harvest the rice. They inspired the entire team to work in the water for three consecutive days, rescuing over 10,000 jin of rice.

These propaganda team members of the poor and lower-middle peasants, with their boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, often go from household to household in the production teams on rainy and muddy nights to conduct propaganda. Although they are often busy until late at night preparing lessons, rehearsing performances, and studying and attending meetings, they are still the first to start work with the commune members the next morning. They say, "Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeblood of us poor and lower-middle peasants. Promoting Mao Zedong Thought is our highest duty. Missing a meal or sleeping a little less is nothing."

Main Experiences:

1. Emphasizing proletarian politics, adhering to the principle of political construction, and focusing on the ideological revolution within the propaganda teams. Taking the People's Liberation Army as an example, actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing proletarian politics, adhering to the four firsts, and promoting the spirit of self-reliance and hard work, the commune's propaganda teams have been built into red Mao Zedong Thought schools. This is the basic policy for the construction of propaganda teams in this commune. The commune and brigades have helped various propaganda teams establish systems for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, conducting criticism and self-criticism, and praising good deeds. They have prevented deviations from proletarian politics and overcome the tendency to focus solely on cultural entertainment, cultivating the propaganda teams as a backbone force for spreading Mao Zedong Thought in the countryside. This has fundamentally ensured the correct political direction of this propaganda force.

2. Establishing the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams of the poor and lower-middle peasants based on the core militia organizations (brigade militia battalions and production team militia squads). This makes the organization more solid, the team more streamlined, the leadership more unified, and the mass nature more evident. It can better play the role of the four teams (Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, political and ideological work teams, combat teams against enemies, and production struggle shock teams), making the propaganda teams a powerful force driving all work in the countryside.

3. The commune and brigades have incorporated the work of the propaganda teams into the regular political work track, strengthened leadership, and consistently focused on it. The commune revolutionary committee has held two training classes for all propaganda team members, organizing them to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and his teachings on propaganda work. They have focused on ideological construction, enhanced the proletarian feelings of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line among the propaganda team members, and their sense of responsibility in promoting Mao Zedong Thought. They have also summarized and promoted experiences and praised advanced collectives and individuals.

4. Adhering to the principles of part-time team building and thrift. This propaganda force conducts all propaganda activities in their spare time and, based on the principle of thrift, strives to achieve more with less or no money. The necessary items and instruments are mainly brought or made by the team members themselves. The small amount of necessary expenses is generally solved through the team's voluntary labor, without using collective funds or asking for money from the state.

    一支宣传毛泽东思想的坚强队伍
    ——广州市郊区石龙公社贫下中农毛泽东思想宣传队网的调查报告
    在无产阶级文化大革命的伟大群众运动中，广州市北郊石龙公社，建立了一支拥有三千七百多人的以民兵组织为基础的贫下中农毛泽东思想宣传队。全公社的十个生产大队、一百六十九个生产队，都有自己的宣传队，平均每七个人中就有一个宣传队员，在全公社形成了一个星罗棋布的宣传网。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“政治宣传的普及乡村，全是共产党和农民协会的功绩。很简单的一些标语、图画和讲演，使得农民如同每个都进过一下子政治学校一样，收效非常之广而速。”石龙公社的贫下中农宣传大军，正是起了这样一种作用。
    这支队伍怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠心，以高度的政治热情，以雷厉风行和艰苦深入的作风，经常地、大张旗鼓而又扎扎实实地宣传和落实毛主席的最新指示，传播无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，对促进广大贫下中农的思想革命化，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，在农村广泛传播伟大的毛泽东思想，作出了贡献。现在，这个公社从墟镇到村庄，家家户户，屋里屋外，到处可以看到伟大领袖毛主席的画像，家家都有《毛泽东选集》，白天，田野里革命歌声嘹亮，入夜，村头一片沸腾，一队队红小兵，举红旗，捧宝书，穿巷过屋，高唱革命歌曲，齐诵毛主席语录，展开宣传活动。逢五逢十的日子，各生产队的社员群众都自动集合起来，集体学习毛主席著作。忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席革命路线的“三忠于”活动开展得轰轰烈烈，社员的精神面貌有很大变化。
    石龙公社贫下中农毛泽东思想宣传队网主要有如下几个特点和经验：
    几个主要的特点
    一、对毛主席的最新指示，闻风而动，雷厉风行，迅速传播，狠抓落实。每当毛主席最新指示一发表，每当无产阶级司令部一发布新的战斗号令，不论白天、黑夜，贫下中农毛泽东思想宣传队都以最快的速度，深入到各村各户，广泛地、大张旗鼓地进行宣传，使全公社二万多群众，都能及时听到毛主席的声音和无产阶级司令部的战斗号令。这次毛主席亲自主持的党的八届扩大的十二中全会的公报广播前，各宣传队就根据电台的预告，组织社员收听有线广播，在一个小时以内就有六千多群众赶到公社参加欢呼公报发表的庆祝大会和游行。全公社锣鼓喧天，欢声四起，形成一片欢呼公报的热潮。
    宣传队员在广泛宣传毛主席最新指示的基础上，还在公社革委会的统一领导下，通过办学习班、上辅导课和开讲用会、座谈会等方法，组织全体社员反复学习毛主席的最新指示，同时狠抓落实。在公社革委会统一组织下，宣传队到阶级斗争最尖锐的生产队和社队企业单位，和这些单位的革命群众同学习、同劳动、同忆苦思甜，提高群众的阶级斗争觉悟，揭开阶级斗争的盖子。广大群众赞扬他们对毛主席的最新指示和无产阶级司令部的战斗号令“宣传快，落实好，讲到做到，不放空炮。”
    二、善于抓住活的思想，开展经常性的政治思想工作，促进社员群众的思想革命化。石龙公社的这支宣传队，又是一支强大的政治思想工作队。群众称赞他们的思想工作有两个深入：一是密切结合各项工作，二是深入各家各户，把思想工作落实到人。在宣传队的带动下，石龙公社出现了广泛开展思想互助的生动活泼的政治局面，农村的政治空气非常浓厚，革命、生产热气腾腾。
    三、广泛运用文艺形式，宣传毛泽东思想，占领农村文化阵地。每当毛主席的最新指示一发表，许多宣传队都能迅速创作和排练出文艺节目配合宣传。现在大队宣传队一般都有三四十个至七八十个小节目可以随时演出。这些文艺演出，政治气氛浓厚，战斗性强，紧密配合了当前的斗争。杨山大队宣传队最近为了配合农村开展的“三忠于”活动和忆苦思甜的阶级教育，根据硖石村在日本侵略军侵占这个村时农民的血泪史，编演了《不忘阶级苦》的歌舞剧，在硖石村演出后，强烈地感染和教育了群众，使文艺演出晚会变成了对旧社会的控诉大会。
    四、树立了模范带头、艰苦奋斗的好队风。在生产队里，他们出工走在前面，收工留在后头，最重最脏的农活，他们主动承担。中八大队十二生产队，今年夏收时有二十多亩已成熟的稻子被水淹没，宣传队员学习了毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”等教导，带头下水，到水最深的田里潜水捞割，带动了全队社员连续三天下水劳动，抢收回一万多斤稻谷。
    这些贫下中农毛泽东思想宣传队员怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的一片忠心，常常在雷雨交加、道路泥泞的夜晚到生产队挨家逐户地进行宣传。他们虽然经常为准备讲课、排练节目和学习、开会忙到深夜，但第二天一早又和社员一起出勤劳动。他们说：“毛泽东思想是我们贫下中农的命根子，宣传毛泽东思想是我们的最高职责，少吃一餐，少睡一点觉不算什么。”
    几条主要的经验
    第一、突出无产阶级政治，坚持政治建队的原则，狠抓宣传队自身的思想革命化。以解放军为榜样，活学活用毛泽东思想，突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，把宣传队办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校，是这个公社宣传队建设的基本方针。公社和大队帮助各宣传队建立了活学活用毛主席著作，开展批评与自我批评，表扬好人好事等政治工作制度，防止脱离无产阶级政治的错误倾向，克服单纯文化娱乐的观点，把宣传队作为在农村传播毛泽东思想的一支骨干队伍来培养。这就从根本上保证了这支宣传队伍正确的政治方向。
    第二、以基干民兵组织（大队民兵营、生产队民兵排）为基础建立贫下中农毛泽东思想宣传队。这就使组织比较落实，队伍比较精干，领导比较统一，又能体现群众性；能较好地发挥四队（既是毛泽东思想宣传队，同时又是政治思想工作的工作队，对敌斗争的战斗队，生产斗争的突击队）的作用，使宣传队成为带动农村一切工作的巨大力量。
    第三、公社、大队把宣传队的工作，纳入经常政治工作的轨道，加强领导，经常抓紧。公社革委会曾两次举办全体宣传队员的毛泽东思想学习班，组织他们学习毛主席的最新指示和毛主席有关宣传工作的教导，大抓思想建设工作，增强宣传队员忠于伟大领袖毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的革命路线的无产阶级感情和宣传毛泽东思想的责任感，并且总结推广了经验，表扬了先进集体和个人。
    第四、坚持业余办队、勤俭办队的原则。这支宣传队伍都是利用业余时间进行各项宣传活动，并且本着勤俭办队的原则，力求做到不花钱、少花钱、多办事。所需的用品、乐器，主要由队员自带或自制，少量必要的开支，一般都通过宣传队本身义务劳动的办法解决，不动集体的资金，也不向国家要钱。广东省、广州市革委会政工组宣传办公室调查组
