A batch of cadres, teachers, and educated youth sent down to Jiangxi have played an active role in the socialist revolution and socialist construction in rural areas after seriously accepting re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants and accelerating their own thought revolutionization. They have received warm praise from poor and lower-middle peasants.

This batch of sent-down personnel, including 11 cadres and 9 teachers from Jiangxi provincial-level organs and 126 educated youth, were sent down to Jiangxi Yiyang County Qianjin Commune in August this year to settle down. They have studied from the People's Liberation Army, established platoons, squads, and squads, adopted the form of collective accommodation and meals, and dispersed to production teams for labor and work in five brigades. After arriving in the countryside, poor and lower-middle peasants first used village and family histories to educate them on class struggle. Poor and lower-middle peasants also targeted the thought of fearing hardship and fatigue among the sent-down personnel, educating them to establish a thorough revolutionary spirit and patiently teaching them farming with their hands. Many old poor peasants even invited the sent-down personnel to their homes to eat, live, work, and talk together, educating them to follow Chairman Mao's words and serve the people wholeheartedly.

Some cadres and teachers originally thought they had "knowledge" and considered being farmers a "waste of talent." After two months in the countryside, their understanding changed. Once, a production team's gasoline engine broke down, and a teacher who had taught advanced physics came to repair it. He talked about the structure of the machine, very "knowledgeable," but when he got to the machine, he didn't know where to start. Later, he had to send it to the county to have a worker repair it. The teacher said shamefully, "The real knowledgeable ones are workers and peasants. I have to start learning from scratch." A young woman, after picking manure for the first time in the countryside, stood in front of a pile of manure and stared blankly. An old poor peasant told her, "Manure is a treasure for increasing production, and crops cannot do without it." She returned and repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings, realizing that it was not the manure that was dirty, but her own thoughts. From then on, she would pick up manure whenever she saw it.

This batch of sent-down personnel deeply felt that labor is an antidote to revisionism and prevention of revisionism. A cadre who originally came from a poor background but later became an "official" in the city and forgot his roots, this time picked up the hoe and carried the manure bucket, deeply moved, saying, "This time going down to the countryside is my second liberation. Chairman Mao pulled me out of the revisionist quagmire." Poor and lower-middle peasants praised him, saying, "The hoe has dug out his labor nature, and farming has removed his official airs." Some cadres, teachers, and educated youth who had never done farm work before learned three to five kinds of farm work through a short period of labor training. They also made more than 300 pieces of furniture, chopped more than 100,000 pounds of firewood, picked more than 12,000 pounds of manure, and basically achieved self-sufficiency in vegetables.

Many production teams in Qianjin Commune are located in remote areas. As soon as the sent-down personnel arrived, they took it as their primary political task to convey Chairman Mao's voice to the poor and lower-middle peasants. Whenever Chairman Mao's latest instructions were issued, they promptly spread them and quickly organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Usually, the sent-down personnel would use Chairman Mao's quotations as textbooks every evening in the production teams to teach poor and lower-middle peasants to read and learn Chairman Mao's teachings, helping them to establish a daily reading system. The sent-down personnel also organized various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes with poor and lower-middle peasants, totaling 66 sessions so far; they also held a lecture meeting once a month. At the same time, they used field rest time and evenings to read newspapers, teach revolutionary songs, and organize propaganda teams to perform in various production teams. The sent-down personnel also widely formed "red pairs" with poor and lower-middle peasants.

Under the leadership of the commune and brigade revolutionary committees, this batch of sent-down personnel, together with poor and lower-middle peasants, studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, and carried out in-depth revolutionary criticism. They organized various forms of struggle meetings with poor and lower-middle peasants, totaling 115 times, with more than 14,000 participants. They combined revolutionary criticism with the purification of class ranks, exposed hidden class enemies, achieved significant victories in the struggle against enemies, and consolidated the socialist position in rural areas.

    认真接受贫下中农再教育  加速自己思想革命化
    江西一批下放人员在农村发挥积极作用
    据新华社南昌二十一日电　今年八月下放到江西宜黄县前进公社安家落户的江西省级直属机关的十一名干部、九名教师、一百二十六名知识青年，认真接受贫下中农的再教育，加速了自己的思想革命化，在农村社会主义革命和社会主义建设中发挥了积极作用，受到贫下中农的热烈赞扬。
    这批下放人员，学习解放军，建立连、排、班，采取集体住宿起伙，分散到生产队劳动、工作的形式，分别在五个大队落户。他们到农村后，贫下中农首先用村史、家史，对他们进行阶级教育。贫下中农还针对下放人员中存在怕苦怕累的思想，教育他们树立彻底革命的思想，并且手把着手，耐心地教他们种田。许多老贫农还把下放人员接到自己家里同吃、同住、同劳动、同谈心，教育他们要听毛主席的话，全心全意为人民服务。
    一些干部、教师，原来觉得自己“有知识”，当农民是“屈才”。下乡两个多月后，他们的认识改变了。有一次，生产队的一台汽油发动机坏了，一位教过高级物理学的教师来修理。他讲机械的结构，很有“知识”，可是到了机器旁，不知从何修起。后来，不得不抬到县里请工人去修。这位教师惭愧地说：“真正有知识的是工人、农民，我要老老实实从头学起。”有一位女青年，下乡后第一次拾粪时，她走到一堆粪前，站着发呆，一位老贫农对她说：“粪是增产的宝，庄稼少不了。”她回来后，反复学习了毛主席的教导，认识到不是粪脏，而是自己的思想脏。从此以后，她看到粪就自觉地去拾。
    这批下放人员到农村后，深深感到劳动是反修防修的抗毒剂。一位原来出身贫苦，后来进城当“官”忘了本的干部，这回拿起锄头，挑上粪桶，深有感触地说：“这次下乡是我第二次得到解放，是毛主席把我从修正主义的泥坑里拉出来。”贫下中农称他“锄头挖回了劳动本色，种田整掉了‘官’气”。一些从来没有干过农活的干部、教师、知识青年，通过短时间的劳动锻炼，普遍学会了三到五门农活。他们还自制家具三百多件、砍柴十万多斤、捡粪一万二千多斤，蔬菜基本做到自给。
    前进公社很多生产队地处偏僻，下放人员一到，就把向贫下中农传达毛主席的声音当作首要的政治任务。每当毛主席最新指示一发表，他们就及时传播，迅速地办起毛泽东思想学习班。平时，下放人员每天晚上以生产队为单位，用毛主席语录作教材，一字一句教贫下中农识字，学习毛主席的教导，帮助贫下中农健全天天读的学习制度。下放人员还和贫下中农一块办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，到目前共办了六十六期；每个月还召开一次讲用会。同时利用田间休息和晚上时间读报，教唱革命歌曲，并组织宣传队，到各生产队进行文艺演出。下放人员还广泛和贫下中农结成“一对红”。
    这批下放人员在社、队革委会的领导下，和贫下中农一道学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，深入开展革命大批判。他们和贫下中农一起组织各种形式的批斗会达一百一十五次，有一万四千多人次参加。他们把革命大批判和清理阶级队伍结合起来，挖出了暗藏的阶级敌人，夺得了对敌斗争的重大胜利，巩固了农村社会主义阵地。
