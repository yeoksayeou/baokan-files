Running schools at the brigade level is excellent. Upon hearing the suggestion from comrades Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu, "Suggesting that all state-run primary schools be transferred to brigades for management," and the important editorial note from the People's Daily, we immediately held a discussion. Participants included representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants and teachers from primary schools. Everyone unanimously agreed that this suggestion is excellent. Our commune has, since March of this year, transferred all state-run primary schools to brigades for management. The nine months of practice have proven that brigades are fully capable of managing schools in terms of political leadership, economics, and teacher resources, and can indeed manage them well.

Transferring state-run primary schools to brigades for management is more beneficial for poor and lower-middle peasants to re-educate teachers, helping them to follow the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers. In the past, when teachers taught in rural areas, they were always separated from poor and lower-middle peasants by a gap, with differing thoughts and feelings. The main reason was that they could not put down their airs, looking down on poor and lower-middle peasants. However, this also has something to do with the school management system. Because the schools were state-run, even if poor and lower-middle peasants discovered political, ideological, or work-related flaws and errors in teachers, they felt that these teachers were on the state payroll, so it was difficult for them to manage or intervene. After transferring to brigade management, the situation is completely different. Poor and lower-middle peasants regard the school as their own and see teachers as members of the brigade, making the relationship closer. They constantly and sincerely care about the teachers' thoughts and work, and promptly and patiently help them correct any flaws or errors. Teachers, as members of the brigade, actively participate in the brigade's class struggle and production struggle. They are not only teachers but also commune members and fighters in the struggle against enemies, becoming increasingly close to poor and lower-middle peasants.

Transferring state-run primary schools to brigades for management is an excellent way to rapidly and efficiently develop rural education. Before carrying out the rural education revolution, the seventh brigade in our commune had only one agricultural and reading class with twenty students. This year, they followed Chairman Mao's instructions to establish schools at the commune and brigade levels, did not ask the state for a single cent, and through self-reliance and collective effort, established a complete primary school with six classes and over 250 students in less than half a month. The school buildings and desks were all made by commune members themselves, and the teachers' salaries are fully borne by the brigade. If relying on the state to manage, first, it would not be possible to do it so quickly, and second, it would require state investment, increasing the state's burden.

The suggestion by comrades Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu that, after transferring state-run primary schools to brigades for management, teachers' work points should be recorded by the brigade and no longer paid by the state, we fully agree with. Recording work points by the brigade not only reduces the state's burden but, more importantly, from the distribution system, makes teachers completely the same as commune members. In the future, teachers will care about the collective, love labor, regard themselves as ordinary commune members, and not separate from the masses, which is beneficial for their ideological transformation.

The suggestion by comrades Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu that teachers from this brigade should return to work in their own brigade is also very good. This not only solves the living difficulties of teachers' families but also, because they are local people, poor and lower-middle peasants know their background, making it more convenient to manage and educate them, which is beneficial for their ideological transformation. It is also beneficial for cleaning up bad elements within the teacher ranks. Regarding the issue of teacher surplus and shortage, from our situation, generally, there is a surplus in urban and plain areas and a shortage in mountainous areas. We suggest that the state can organize and mobilize some teachers in urban and plain areas to go to those places to settle down.

　　大队办学就是好
    从广播里听到侯振民、王庆余两同志《建议所有公办小学下放到大队来办》和《人民日报》的重要编者按，我们连夜就进行了座谈讨论。参加讨论的有贫下中农代表和小学教师代表，大家一致认为，这个建议好得很，我们公社从今年三月起，就已经把所有公办小学下放到大队办了。九个月来的实践证明，大队在政治领导、经济、师资等条件上完全能够办学，完全能够办好。
    公办小学下放到大队办，更有利于贫下中农对教师进行再教育，帮助他们走同工农兵相结合的道路。过去教师在农村教书，同贫下中农总是隔着一条沟，思想感情格格不入。主要原因是他们放不下架子，轻视贫下中农，但是，与学校管理体制也有一定的关系。因为学校是公办的，贫下中农就是发现了教师政治上、思想上、工作上有缺点、错误，但觉得他们是吃公粮的，不好管，也管不着。下放到大队办以后，情况就完全不一样了。贫下中农把学校看成是自己的学校，把教师看成是大队的一员，关系就密切了，随时随地关心他们的思想和工作，有什么缺点、错误，就及时耐心地进行帮助；教师作为大队的一员，积极参加大队的阶级斗争和生产斗争。既是教员，又是社员，又是对敌斗争的战斗员，同贫下中农越来越亲密了。
    把公办小学下放到大队来办，是多快好省地发展农村教育事业的好办法。我们公社第七大队在开展农村教育革命以前，全大队只有一个二十名学生的耕读班，今年他们遵照毛主席关于社、队办学校的指示，没有要国家一分钱，自力更生，群策群力，不到半个月就办起了一所有六个班、二百五十多个学生的完全小学。学校房子和桌凳，都是社员自己动手做的，教师工资完全由大队负担。如果依靠国家办，第一办不了这么快，第二需要国家投资，增加国家负担。
    侯振民、王庆余两同志提的公办小学下放到大队办以后，教师由大队记工分，不再要国家发工资，这个建议我们完全同意。由大队记工分，除了减轻国家负担以外，更重要的是，从分配制度上让教师完全同社员一样。以后，教师就能关心集体，热爱劳动，把自己当作普通社员，不脱离群众，有利于他们的思想改造。
    侯振民、王庆余两同志提出本大队教师调回本大队工作，这个建议也非常好。这不仅可以解决教师家属的生活困难，而且因为是本乡本土人，贫下中农知他们的底，更便于对他们进行管理教育，有利于他们的思想革命化，同时也有利于清理教师队伍中的坏人。关于教师的余缺调济问题，从我们这里的情况看，一般是城市、平原地区有余，山区不足。我们建议，国家可在城市和平原地区，组织动员一部分教师去到那里插队落户。
