The poor and lower-middle peasants of Baoshan Brigade in Xinzhou People's Commune, Danzhou County, Hainan Island, have been running schools for ten years. The ten-year practice of running schools has fully proved that Chairman Mao's great teaching, "In the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants," is extremely wise and correct.

In 1958, during the high tide of the commune movement, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Baoshan Brigade, following Chairman Mao's great directive, "Regarding the issue of commune-run and brigade-run schools, those with conditions should be allowed to run them," overcame numerous difficulties and, after a fierce class struggle, established Baoshan Brigade's people-run primary school. They smashed the revisionist educational system, seized the pen with Mao Zedong Thought, and criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line pushed by the traitor Liu Shaoqi. This primary school managed by the poor and lower-middle peasants has been consolidated and developed in the struggle between the two educational lines, from a primary school to a complete primary school, with students increasing from over fifty to over one hundred. Practice has proved that Baoshan Brigade's people-run primary school is more welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants than the local state-run primary school. The enrollment rate of school-age children in Baoshan Brigade has reached over 95% every year, while the highest enrollment rate of poor and lower-middle peasant children in the nearby state-run primary school in Taiyanghong Brigade is only 35%; after ten years of effort, Baoshan Brigade has basically eliminated illiteracy among its youth, while Taiyanghong Brigade still has over 50% of its youth who cannot read a single word; it costs Baoshan Brigade only about 30 yuan to cultivate a primary school graduate, while the state-run primary school needs over 200 yuan.

The two different schools have a clear class line on the issue of serving whom! The poor peasant Guo Laohan from Baoshan Brigade has six children. Except for the two youngest who are not yet of school age, the other four all went to school with the help of the brigade and school's economic assistance. However, the state-run primary school strictly controls the tuition fees for the children of the poor and lower-middle peasants, resulting in a batch of poor and lower-middle peasant children being unable to enroll or dropping out of school every year.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Baoshan Brigade not only popularized primary education but, more importantly, cultivated a batch of "laborers with socialist consciousness and culture." Most of the graduates from Baoshan Brigade's primary school have been content to participate in agricultural production. After a few years of labor tempering, some have joined the People's Liberation Army and been rated as five-good soldiers; some have taken on leadership roles in production teams. These students love Chairman Mao and are loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. During classes, they actively study Chairman Mao's works, and outside of school, they enthusiastically propagate Chairman Mao's latest directives. In the fierce and complex class struggle, they stand firm, withstand tests, and see clearly. For a period, the class enemies used methods such as distributing work points and subsidies to bribe students to engage in armed struggles. Some students from state-run schools were deceived and followed the bad elements to do bad things, but not a single student from Baoshan Brigade was fooled. They lead a simple and frugal life, mending their clothes themselves, and wearing them even when patched.

The main experiences of this brigade in running schools are:

(1) Occupying the school battlefield with Mao Zedong Thought

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Baoshan Brigade, armed with Chairman Mao's great teaching, "We should make the educated develop morally, intellectually, and physically, and become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture," conduct teaching. They say: "Our happiness is all thanks to Chairman Mao, and our liberation is all thanks to the Communist Party. We must educate our descendants to be forever loyal to Chairman Mao." In the early days of the school's establishment, the brigade leadership especially emphasized: Do not teach students about flowers and grass; teach them more about Chairman Mao's great achievements and the deeds of revolutionary heroes. The school, based on the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants, adopted a critical attitude towards old textbooks, removing the poison of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, and highlighting proletarian political content. Since Vice Chairman Lin issued the great call to "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao," Baoshan Primary School has always treated Chairman Mao's works as the main course.

(2) The poor and lower-middle peasants must directly hold the power of the school

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power and consolidating power." The poor and lower-middle peasants clearly understand that the leadership issue is the fundamental issue. In the past, the leadership of schools was mostly in the hands of bourgeois intellectuals. To ensure that the leadership of the school is firmly in the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants, they established a "Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' School Management Committee" under the leadership of the brigade party branch, with the poor and lower-middle peasants as the main body, directly holding the power of the school. The appointment and dismissal of teachers, teaching content, teaching equipment, school opening and closing, and financial income and expenditure are all decided by the committee after mobilizing the masses to discuss and solve. After the poor and lower-middle peasants seized the pen, their enthusiasm for running schools was very high. Seeing that the school's propaganda team lacked instruments for performing items praising Chairman Mao, they pooled money to buy a set and sent it over. A 59-year-old poor peasant, Grandma Xie Xiangrui, found that the classroom was leaking, and immediately sent the money prepared for repairing the house to the school for repairs.

(3) Education must be combined with productive labor

From the beginning of the school's establishment, the brigade party branch, following Chairman Mao's teaching, "Education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor," arranged teaching as follows: classes in the morning, participating in collective productive labor at noon, and helping parents study Chairman Mao's works after class. The school also set up a small farm of two mu, which not only solved part of the school's expenses, reducing the burden on the brigade and the poor and lower-middle peasants, but more importantly, allowed teachers and students to frequently participate in labor, strengthening their feelings for the laboring people. The students regard labor as an honor, carrying a manure basket to school, and collecting manure for the collective on the way. The poor and lower-middle peasants are satisfied and say: "Such children are reliable successors of the poor and lower-middle peasants."

(4) Establishing a revolutionary teaching staff

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Baoshan Brigade, following Chairman Mao's brilliant educational thought, "The most important problem for a military school is to select the principal and teachers and to formulate the educational policy," established a revolutionary teaching staff. The principal is the brigade secretary or deputy secretary, and the teachers are selected locally, living and eating at home, teaching at school, and returning to the brigade for labor. The poor and lower-middle peasants' treatment of teachers is the same as that of commune members, with additional work points, roughly equivalent to the income of a middle to upper-level labor force, plus a monthly living allowance of two yuan. This ensures that teachers do not become detached from the masses, labor, or the reality of class struggle.

The poor and lower-middle peasants attach great importance to the ideological construction of the teaching staff. Some teachers once had some wrong ideas, thinking that people-run teachers are like temporary workers with no future. The poor and lower-middle peasants, targeting this active thought, enthusiastically helped them study the "Three Articles," inspiring them to use Zhang Zedong, Bai Qien, Lei Feng, and Wang Jie as mirrors to examine and check themselves. The bitter and deep-hated old poor peasants also gave the teachers lessons on recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, criticizing bourgeois ideas of fame, wealth, and position. The poor and lower-middle peasants said earnestly: "Do not look down on yourselves, this is for the poor and lower-middle peasants to run schools! If you do not run this school, can it be run by the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists?" This raised the political awareness of the teachers and corrected their teaching attitude. They said: "To ensure that the children of the poor and lower-middle peasants can all go to school and study, we are willing to be 'barefoot teachers' for life."

### 宝山大队贫下中农办学十年

　　宝山大队贫下中农办学十年
    海南岛儋县新州公社宝山大队，贫下中农办学已经有十年的历史。十年办学的实践，充分证明了毛主席“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校”的伟大教导，无比英明，无比正确。
    一九五八年在公社化运动高潮中，宝山大队贫下中农，根据毛主席“关于社办、队办学校问题，有条件的应该允许办”的伟大指示，克服了重重困难，经过了一番激烈的阶级斗争，创建了宝山大队民办小学。他们破除了修正主义教育制度，用毛泽东思想掌了文权，对叛徒刘少奇推行的反革命修正主义教育路线进行了批判。贫下中农管理的这所小学，在两条教育路线斗争中，不断巩固和发展，由初小到完小，学生由五十多人发展到一百多人。实践证明，宝山大队的民办小学，要比当地的公办小学受贫下中农欢迎。宝山大队贫下中农的适龄儿童，每年入学率均达百分之九十五以上，而附近的一所公办小学所在的太阳红大队，贫下中农子女入学率最高只有百分之三十五；宝山大队经过十年努力，已在青少年中基本上消灭了文盲，而太阳红大队还有百分之五十多的青少年，一字不识；宝山大队贫下中农培养一个高小毕业生，只用三十元左右，而公办小学却需要二百元以上。
    两个不同的学校，在为什么人服务的问题上，阶级路线非常鲜明！宝山大队贫农郭老汉有六个孩子，除最小的两个不到入学年龄外，其余四个都是在大队和学校给予经济上的帮助后，进学校读书的。但公办小学对贫下中农子女的学费卡得很死，致使每年都有一批贫下中农子女不能入学或中途退学。
    宝山大队贫下中农管理学校，不仅普及了小学教育，更重要的是培养了一批“有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”。宝山大队小学历届毕业生，绝大多数安心参加农业生产。他们经过几年的劳动锻炼后，有的参加了人民解放军，被评为五好战士；有的担任了生产队领导工作。这些学生无限热爱毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想。上课时，积极学习毛主席著作，到校外热情宣传毛主席最新指示。在激烈复杂的阶级斗争风浪中，他们站得稳，顶得住，看得清。有一个时期，阶级敌人以记工分发补助等经济主义手段来收买学生搞武斗，一些公办学校的部分学生受了蒙蔽，跟着坏人干坏事，但宝山大队的学生却没有一个人上当。他们日常生活艰苦朴素，衣服破了自己补，补钉累累还在穿。
    这个大队贫下中农办学的主要经验是：
    （一）用毛泽东思想占领学校阵地
    宝山大队贫下中农以毛主席“应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”的伟大教导为武器，进行教学。他们说：“幸福多亏毛主席，翻身全靠共产党。我们要教育子孙后代，永远忠于毛主席。”建校初期，大队领导特别强调指出：不要给学生讲那些花花草草的东西，要多讲毛主席的伟大功绩，多讲革命英雄人物的事迹。学校根据贫下中农的意见，对旧课本采取了批判的态度，去掉封、资、修的毒素，突出无产阶级政治内容。自林副主席发出“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士”的伟大号召后，宝山小学就一直把毛主席著作当主课。
    （二）贫下中农要直接掌握学校大权
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”贫下中农清楚地认识到，领导权问题是根本问题，过去学校的领导权，大多数都是落在资产阶级知识分子手中。为了保证学校的领导权牢牢掌握在贫下中农手里，他们成立了在大队党支部领导下，以贫下中农为主体的“贫下中农管理学校委员会”，直接掌握学校大权。教师任免、教学内容、教学设备、开学放假、经费收支等都由管委会发动群众讨论解决。贫下中农掌握文权后，办学热情很高。看见学校宣传队演出歌颂毛主席的节目缺乏乐器，便凑钱买一套送去。五十九岁的贫农老大娘谢香桂发现教室漏雨，立即把准备修房用的钱送给学校修补。
    （三）教育必须同生产劳动相结合
    建校一开始，大队党支部遵照毛主席“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合”的教导，教学安排是：上午上课，中午参加集体生产劳动，下课后帮助父母学习毛主席著作。学校还办了二亩地的小型农场，这不仅能解决学校部分经费，减轻大队和贫下中农负担，更重要的是使师生经常参加劳动，增强对劳动人民的思想感情。学生视劳动为荣，上学时提着粪筐，来回路上为集体积肥。贫下中农满意地说：“这样的孩子，是我们贫下中农可靠的接班人。”
    （四）建立一支革命化的教师队伍
    宝山大队贫下中农按照毛主席“一个军事学校，最重要的问题，是选择校长教员和规定教育方针”的光辉教育思想，建立了一支革命化的教师队伍。校长是大队支书或副支书兼任，教员都是就地选择，吃住在家，教学在校，劳动回队。贫下中农对教师的待遇，和社员一样，再补助一些工分，大体相当于一个中上等劳力的工分收入，外加每月二元钱的生活补助。这就从生活上和制度上保证了教师不脱离群众，不脱离劳动，不脱离阶级斗争实际。
    贫下中农十分重视教师队伍的思想建设。有的教师曾一度产生过一些错误观点，认为民办教师象个临时工，没出息。贫下中农就针对这种活思想，热情地帮助他们学习“老三篇”，启发他们以张思德、白求恩和雷锋、王杰等英雄人物作镜子，对照检查自己。苦大仇深的老贫农还给教师上忆苦思甜课，批判资产阶级名利地位思想。贫下中农语重心长地说：“你们不要小看了自己，这是为贫下中农办学啊！这个学你们不办，能让地富反坏右分子去办吗？”从而提高了教师的政治觉悟，端正了教学态度。他们说：“为了贫下中农子女都能上学读书，我们愿意当一辈子‘赤脚教师’。”
