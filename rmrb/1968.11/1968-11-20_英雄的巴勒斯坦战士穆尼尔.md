In the ranks of the "Fatah" (Palestine National Liberation Movement) guerrillas, there are countless heroic fighters. Munir Wadiyeh Abdullatif, who sacrificed his life for the liberation of Palestine in February this year, is just one of the many Palestinian heroes.

On the night of February 8, Munir led 35 guerrillas to ambush and annihilate 12 Israeli invading soldiers on the West Bank of the Jordan River. When they returned to their base, they encountered the enemy in the Uga area. In a situation where the enemy outnumbered them, Munir decisively ordered his soldiers to retreat, leaving himself and four other guerrillas to provide cover. The soldiers all wanted to stay and have him lead the retreat. In this critical moment, Munir resolutely issued the order: "Retreat quickly! Don't worry about us! The burden of liberating Palestine needs you to continue to bear it."

Thirty soldiers, under the cover of Munir and his comrades, broke through the enemy's encirclement and safely returned to their base. Munir and the other four, after completing their covering mission, could no longer retreat. They used the advantageous terrain to fight the enemy for nearly two hours, killing more than a dozen enemy soldiers and destroying two half-track military vehicles. It was only after the enemy's reinforcements, including tanks, arrived that Munir and the four Palestinian guerrillas shouted, "Revolution until victory!" and spilled their last drop of blood for the liberation of the Palestinian people.

After Munir's heroic sacrifice, a responsible person from the "Fatah" strike force headquarters, while sorting through Munir's belongings, found a letter he had left for his family, encouraging his family to continue fighting the enemy and instructing them not to accept any compensation, because the Palestinian revolution was in a difficult period and needed every patriot to endure hardships and make sacrifices for the revolutionary cause.

One hero falls, and thousands of heroes rise. Munir's revolutionary heroism has greatly inspired his comrades and the Palestinian people. Many young "Fatah" strike force members have expressed their determination to follow Munir's example and dedicate everything to the national liberation cause of Palestine. His former comrades in the guerrilla unit have turned their grief into strength and are now striking the enemy even more fiercely. Munir's cousin, upon hearing the news of Munir's sacrifice, immediately joined the "Fatah" strike force and has also shown great bravery in battle.

Munir was born into a peasant family in the village of Alar in the central Palestinian region of Tukarim. In 1948, the American and British imperialists created an "Israel" in Palestine, seizing Munir's homeland. The nine-year-old Munir and his family were forced to leave their homeland and wander to the Arab area on the West Bank of the Jordan River, beginning a miserable life as refugees.

To save his country and people, the young Munir joined the "Fatah" underground organization after graduating from middle school. Soon, he gave up his job as an elementary school teacher and threw himself into the struggle to liberate Palestine. He was one of the earliest members of the "Storm" strike force under "Fatah."

In the fiery battle life, Munir found the great truth of Mao Zedong Thought and began to study Mao's brilliant works and the experiences of the Chinese revolution with great enthusiasm. He had a set of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in Arabic, and during moments of battle, he often opened this treasure and studied it seriously. Munir greatly respected the great leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong, and loved New China. He often told his comrades: "China is the most reliable friend of the Palestinian people. The Palestinian revolution can only rely on the great Mao Zedong Thought, follow the path of the Chinese revolution, and persist in a protracted people's war to ultimately defeat the Israeli Zionists supported by American imperialism and liberate Palestine."

When he was the commander of a detachment of the "Storm" strike force, Munir often propagated Mao's brilliant expositions on guerrilla warfare to his comrades and local residents, inspiring their fighting spirit. Munir deeply understood Mao's teachings: "Revolutionary war is the war of the masses; it can be waged only by mobilizing the masses and can be waged only by relying on the masses." Based on the specific situation of the place, he organized, armed, and trained the masses and mobilized them to dig tunnels for self-defense. In the battles against enemy attacks, many residents in his area fought side by side with the guerrillas, effectively striking the enemy.

The invincible Mao Zedong Thought gave Munir boundless courage and wisdom. The guerrilla unit he led often appeared in the enemy-occupied areas, from the Mediterranean coast of Tel Aviv to the Besan Valley by the Jordan River, repeatedly striking the enemy.

The "Fatah" guerrilla fighters often discuss Munir's heroic deeds with reverence. A political commissar of the "Storm" strike force said: "Munir is a revolutionary fighter nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. He, with the noble quality of serving the people wholeheartedly as taught by Chairman Mao, has set an example for us young guerrillas." The magazine "Palestine Revolution" recently wrote in an article commemorating Munir: "Munir is an example of those determined to fight for the liberation of Palestine. His death has made the Palestinian revolution lose a hero. However, millions of Arab people will surely, like Munir, be determined to take up arms and fight until victory!"

### 英雄的巴勒斯坦战士穆尼尔

　　英雄的巴勒斯坦战士穆尼尔
    在巴勒斯坦“法塔赫”（巴勒斯坦民族解放运动）所属的游击队里，有着许许多多英雄的战士。今年二月为巴勒斯坦解放斗争献出自己生命的穆尼尔·瓦第叶·阿卜杜拉蒂夫，就是无数巴勒斯坦英雄战士中的一个。
    今年二月八日夜晚，穆尼尔率领三十五名游击队员在约旦河西岸伏击歼灭了十二名以色列侵略军。当他们返回基地的时候，在乌加地区和敌军遭遇。在敌众我寡的情况下，穆尼尔果断地命令他的战士撤退，留下他自己和另外四名游击队员打掩护。战士们都争着要留下，而要他率领转移。在危急的关头，穆尼尔毅然决然地下达命令：“快撤！不要管我们！巴勒斯坦解放的重担需要你们继续承担。”
    三十名战士在穆尼尔等战友的掩护下，冲出了敌人的包围圈，安全地返回了基地。穆尼尔等五人在完成掩护任务后，已经来不及转移了。他们利用有利的地形，和敌人激战了将近两小时，打死了十几名敌军，击毁了两辆半履带式的军车，直到敌人增援的坦克冲上来以后，穆尼尔等五名巴勒斯坦游击战士，才最后高呼：“革命，直到胜利！”为巴勒斯坦人民的解放事业，流尽了最后一滴鲜血。
    穆尼尔壮烈牺牲后，“法塔赫”突击队总部的一位负责人在清理穆尼尔的遗物时，发现他给家属留下的一份遗书，鼓励他的家属继续和敌人战斗，并且嘱咐家属千万不要领取抚恤金，因为巴勒斯坦革命正处于困难时期，需要每一个巴勒斯坦爱国者为革命事业忍受困难和牺牲。
    一个英雄倒下去，千万个英雄站起来。穆尼尔的革命英雄事迹，给了他的战友和巴勒斯坦人民以巨大鼓舞。很多年轻的“法塔赫”突击队员，表示决心以穆尼尔为榜样，为巴勒斯坦的民族解放事业贡献出自己的一切。他生前所在的游击队的战友化悲痛为力量，正在更猛烈地打击敌人。穆尼尔的堂弟在知道穆尼尔牺牲的消息后，立即参加了“法塔赫”突击队，在战斗中表现得也很英勇。
    穆尼尔出生于巴勒斯坦中部图卡里姆地区的阿拉尔村的一个农民家庭里。一九四八年，美英帝国主义者在巴勒斯坦制造出一个“以色列”，霸占了穆尼尔的家园。九岁的穆尼尔和他的一家被迫离开了自己的故乡，流浪到约旦河西岸阿拉伯区，开始过着悲惨的难民生活。
    为了拯救自己的祖国和人民，年轻的穆尼尔在中学毕业后，就参加了“法塔赫”地下组织。不久，他又放弃了小学教师的职务，投身到解放巴勒斯坦的斗争激流中去。他是“法塔赫”所属的“暴风”突击队最早的队员之一。
    在火热的战斗生活中，穆尼尔找到了毛泽东思想的伟大真理，开始如饥似渴地学习毛主席的光辉著作和中国革命斗争的经验。他有一套阿拉伯文版的《毛泽东选集》，在战斗空闲的时刻，他常常打开这部宝书，认真学习。穆尼尔十分尊敬中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席，热爱新中国。他常常对他的战友说：“中国是我们巴勒斯坦人民最可信赖的朋友。巴勒斯坦革命只有依靠伟大的毛泽东思想，走中国革命的道路，坚持持久的人民战争，才能最后战胜美帝国主义支持的以色列犹太复国主义者，解放巴勒斯坦。”
    在他担任“暴风”突击队一个支队队长的时候，穆尼尔经常向他的战友和驻地的群众宣传毛主席关于游击战争等光辉论述，鼓舞人们的斗志。穆尼尔深深地理解到毛主席的教导：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”他根据当地的具体情况，在群众中进行组织、武装和训练工作，并且发动群众挖掘地道，进行自卫。在反击敌人袭击的战斗中，他所在地区的很多群众同游击队并肩战斗，有力地打击了敌人。
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想，给了穆尼尔以无穷的勇敢和智慧。他领导的这支游击队经常出没在敌占区，从地中海岸的特拉维夫到约旦河畔的贝桑河谷，多次英勇地打击敌人。
      “法塔赫”游击队战士，常常怀着崇敬的心情，谈论着穆尼尔的英雄事迹。一位“暴风”突击队的政委说：“穆尼尔是在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的一个革命战士。他以毛主席教导的全心全意为人民服务的高贵品质，为我们年青的游击队员树立了一个榜样。”《巴勒斯坦革命》刊物最近在一篇悼念穆尼尔的文章中写道：“穆尼尔是决心为解放巴勒斯坦而战斗的榜样。他的死使巴勒斯坦革命失去了一个英雄。但是，千百万阿拉伯人民肯定会象穆尼尔那样，决心拿起武器进行战斗，直到胜利！”
