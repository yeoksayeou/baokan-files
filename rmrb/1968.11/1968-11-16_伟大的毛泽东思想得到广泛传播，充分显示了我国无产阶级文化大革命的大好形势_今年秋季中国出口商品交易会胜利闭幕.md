The great thoughts of Mao Zedong are widely spread, fully reflecting the excellent situation of China's proletarian cultural revolution. The 1968 autumn China export commodities fair successfully concludes. Friends from the trade circles of the five continents have been unprecedentedly enthusiastic, and the transaction amounts for exports and imports have surpassed those of previous fairs.

Despite the attempts by imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries to sabotage the fair during its period, their conspiracies have met with shameful failure.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, November 15 - The 1968 autumn China export commodities fair held in Guangzhou concluded successfully today. The fair, which lasted for a month, has achieved great victories in spreading the great thoughts of Mao Zedong, expanding China's international friendly exchanges, and promoting mutual exchange of goods with various countries and regions on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. The fair has been bustling with activity throughout, and the transaction amounts for exports and imports have surpassed those of previous fairs.

Friends from the trade circles of the five continents have been unprecedentedly enthusiastic in participating in this fair. The number of government trade officials, representatives of state-owned companies, and national traders from many Asian and African countries, as well as trade and business people from Western European countries, has increased compared to previous fairs. Japanese friendly trading companies, overseas Chinese, and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao have also been very enthusiastic in participating. Trade delegations from countries such as Tanzania, Guinea, Congo (Brazzaville), Nepal, Cambodia, and Iraq have also come to participate in the fair. The fair has negotiated tens of thousands of trade contracts with the participating trade friends. Despite the continuous slander and attempts at sabotage by imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries during the fair, their conspiracies have met with shameful failure. The great victory of the fair has confirmed the statement in the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee: "We are not isolated; more than 90% of the world's population who want revolution are our friends."

The fair has also received friends from several countries and regions, including political, economic, military, cultural, and diplomatic friendly organizations, as well as a large number of foreign sailors, compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao, and overseas Chinese, who came to visit the exhibition of industrial and agricultural products. After visiting the fair, the head of the Albanian government's economic delegation, Adil Charchani, enthusiastically praised, "At the fair, we saw a large number of new products created by the Chinese working class with their hands and wisdom, which have reached an internationally advanced level. We also saw the creative labor achievements of Chinese farmers and herdsmen. The great achievements of the Chinese people are a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists." He said, "The fair we saw is not only a place for trade, but more importantly, the fair has made a great contribution to spreading Mao Zedong Thought to the world."

During the fair, the publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee has greatly encouraged some foreign friends participating in the fair. An African friend excitedly said, "The communiqué is a summary of the victories of the proletarian cultural revolution in China over the past two years, and it will have a great encouraging effect on the struggles of the revolutionary people of the world." Some Japanese friends, after hearing about the communiqué, held a discussion meeting, and some even went out to celebrate its publication.

During the fair, foreign friends from the five continents also visited our factories, rural people's communes, and schools, and had extensive contact with our workers, peasants, Red Guards, and revolutionary intellectuals. Through visits and inspections, foreign friends have gained a further understanding and knowledge of our country's working class's enthusiastic response to the great leader Chairman Mao's call for the working class to lead everything, and their revolutionary practice of fighting, criticizing, and reforming the superstructure, as well as the excellent situation of our country's proletarian cultural revolution nearing overall victory. The new variety of proletarian revolutionary art - piano accompaniment "The Red Lantern," as well as revolutionary modern Beijing operas "The Red Lantern," "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," "The Red Detachment of Women," "The Red Guard," and revolutionary modern ballet "The White-Haired Girl," and revolutionary symphony "The Red Detachment of Women," have been highly praised and evaluated by friends from the five continents.

Tonight, the fair held a closing banquet. More than 3,000 people attended the banquet. Jia Shi, deputy minister of China's Ministry of Foreign Trade, attended the banquet. Chen Yu, deputy chairman of the Guangdong Revolutionary Committee and chairman of the China Export Commodities Fair, spoke at the banquet. He said: The fair, which lasted for a month, has achieved great success, which is another victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Chen Yu said: The unprecedented scale of the fair has dealt a heavy blow to our enemies and thoroughly smashed all their sabotage conspiracies. The current international situation is excellent, and the world revolution has entered a great new era. The imperialists led by the United States and the modern revisionists led by the Soviet revisionist traitor clique are full of contradictions, disintegrating, and in great difficulties both internally and externally, with no way out, and are in unprecedented isolation. As the great leader Chairman Mao pointed out, "It can be said for sure that the thorough collapse of colonialism, imperialism, and all exploitative systems, and the thorough liberation of all oppressed peoples and nations in the world, are not far away." Chen Yu finally expressed that the Chinese people will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, better fulfill their internationalist duties, continue to implement the policy of equal and mutually beneficial foreign trade, actively develop international friendly trade exchanges, and enhance friendship with the people of all countries in the world.

After the banquet, a celebration evening was held, and the Shanghai Ballet School's ballet troupe performed the revolutionary modern ballet "The White-Haired Girl."

　　今年秋季中国出口商品交易会胜利闭幕
　　来自世界五大洲的贸易界朋友空前踊跃，出口和进口的成交额超过了历届交易会
　　尽管帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派在交易会期间不断企图进行破坏，但是它们的阴谋遭到了可耻的失败
    新华社广州十五日电　在广州举办的一九六八年秋季中国出口商品交易会，今天胜利闭幕。历时一个月的交易会，在传播伟大的毛泽东思想，扩大我国的国际友好往来和同各国、各地区在平等互利基础上互通有无方面，都取得了巨大的胜利。交易会始终呈现着繁荣兴旺的景象，出口和进口的成交额超过了历届交易会。
    前来参加这次交易会的来自世界五大洲的贸易界朋友空前踊跃。到会洽谈贸易的亚非许多国家的政府贸易官员、国营公司代表和民族贸易商，以及西欧各国的贸易界、企业界人士，都比历届多。日本友好商社和海外华侨、港澳同胞到会的也非常踊跃。坦桑尼亚、几内亚、刚果（布）、尼泊尔、柬埔寨、伊拉克等国家还派了贸易代表团前来参加交易会。交易会同到会的贸易界朋友洽谈了数万笔交易合同。尽管帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派在交易会期间不断进行无耻的造谣、诬蔑，企图进行破坏，但是它们的阴谋遭到了可耻的失败。交易会的巨大胜利证实了党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报指出的：“我们决不孤立，占世界人口百分之九十以上要革命的人民都是我们的朋友。”
    交易会还接待了几十个国家和地区包括政治、经济、军事、文化、外交友好团体等方面的国际朋友，以及大批外国海员、港澳同胞和海外华侨，前来参观交易会展出的工农业产品。阿尔巴尼亚政府经济代表团团长阿迪尔·查尔查尼参观了交易会后热情地赞扬说：“在交易会上，我们看到了中国工人阶级用双手和智慧创造出来的大量具有国际先进水平的新产品，同时也看到了中国农民、牧民创造性的劳动成果。中国人民的伟大成就是对美帝、苏修的沉重打击。”他说：“我们看到的交易会不仅是一个贸易场所，更重要的是，交易会为向全世界传播毛泽东思想作出了巨大的贡献。”
    交易会期间，党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的发表，使参加交易会的一些外国朋友受到巨大鼓舞。一位非洲朋友兴奋地说：“公报是中国两年多无产阶级文化大革命胜利的总结，它对世界革命人民的斗争将产生巨大的鼓舞。”一些日本朋友听到公报后，还举行了座谈会，有的还上街游行欢呼公报的发表。
    在交易会期间，来自五大洲的外国朋友还参观了我国的工厂、农村人民公社和学校，广泛接触了我国的工人、农民、红卫兵小将和革命知识分子。通过参观访问，各国朋友对我国工人阶级热烈响应伟大领袖毛主席关于工人阶级必须领导一切的号召，登上上层建筑斗、批、改历史舞台的革命实践，以及我国无产阶级文化大革命接近全面胜利的大好形势，有了进一步的认识和了解。在交易会期间演出的无产阶级革命文艺的新品种——钢琴伴唱《红灯记》，以及革命现代京剧《红灯记》、《智取威虎山》、《沙家浜》、《海港》，革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》、《红色娘子军》，革命交响音乐《沙家浜》等革命样板戏，受到了五大洲朋友的热烈赞扬和高度评价。
    今晚，交易会举行了闭幕酒会。参加酒会的有三千多人。我国对外贸易部副部长贾石出席了酒会。广东省革命委员会副主任、中国出口商品交易会主任委员陈郁在酒会上讲了话。他说：历时一个月的交易会取得了巨大的成就，这是毛泽东思想的又一胜利。陈郁说：交易会的空前盛况给我们的敌人以沉重打击，彻底粉碎了它们的一切破坏阴谋。当前国际形势一片大好，世界革命进入了一个伟大的新时代。以美国为首的帝国主义者和以苏修叛徒集团为首的现代修正主义者，矛盾重重，分崩离析，内外交困，走投无路，陷入空前的孤立。正如伟大领袖毛主席指出的：“可以肯定，殖民主义、帝国主义和一切剥削制度的彻底崩溃，世界上一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族的彻底翻身，已经为期不远了。”陈郁最后表示，中国人民将更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更好地履行国际主义义务，继续贯彻平等互利、互通有无的对外贸易政策，积极发展国际友好贸易往来，增进同世界各国人民的友谊。
    酒会结束后，举行了庆祝晚会，由上海芭蕾舞蹈学校芭蕾舞剧组演出了革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》。
