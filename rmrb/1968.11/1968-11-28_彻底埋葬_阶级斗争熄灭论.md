The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party is a meeting of great historical significance. The communiqué of the session is the voice of our great leader Chairman Mao. Every word and sentence resonate deeply with our working class. We wholeheartedly support it and fully agree with it! The session decided to expel Liu Shaoqi, the arch-enemy of the working class, from the Party permanently and to remove all his Party and non-Party positions. This expresses the wishes of the working class and the broad revolutionary people, and it clears away the greatest harm for us, making us feel greatly relieved. All this is due to the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao!

In the past two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, there has been extremely complex and sharp class struggle. As an ordinary worker and Party member, I have been tempered and tested in this great revolution. I have come to understand more deeply the greatness and correctness of Chairman Mao's theory on class, class contradictions, and class struggle in socialist society.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Socialist society is a fairly long historical stage. In this historical stage of socialism, there are still classes, class contradictions, and class struggle, there is the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism, and there is the danger of capitalist restoration." Chairman Mao's great directive is a powerful ideological weapon for us to carry out class struggle and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat under socialist conditions.

For a long time, the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi has been fiercely opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. He has been vigorously advocating the theory of the extinction of class struggle, claiming that "the principal contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie has been resolved," "the bourgeoisie has been basically eliminated," and that capitalists "no longer want to resist socialism." They can even "join the Party." In short, classes and class struggle no longer exist.

We workers understand from our own experiences of being exploited and oppressed before liberation, and from the sharp and complex class struggle practices after liberation, what kind of goods Liu Shaoqi's theory of the extinction of class struggle is!

In the old society, Tianjin Sanjiao Stone was a living hell for workers. Countless apprentices, once they entered the factory, were forced to sign "indenture contracts" and suffered brutal exploitation and torture. Countless workers under the reactionary capitalists' whips, in the dark and dilapidated foundry sheds, and next to the primitive and heavy machinery, were exploited without day or night, "getting up at dawn, sleeping at one in the morning, swinging the hammer in the dead of night." In Sanjiao Stone, how many of our class brothers were drained of their vitality and driven out of the factory! How many of our class brothers were frozen and starved to death!

The East is red, the sun rises. Chairman Mao, the old man, liberated us workers of Sanjiao Stone from this living hell. The cattle of the old society became the masters of the new society. We workers have stood up, and the bourgeoisie gnash their teeth in hatred, dreaming of restoring their lost paradise. The talk of "class struggle being extinguished" is all nonsense!

Since liberation, class struggle has never stopped. Taking our factory as an example, some reactionary capitalists who used to exploit and oppress us once again held the reins of production under the protection and promotion of the capitalist-roaders within the Party. The capitalist-roaders trusted the capitalists and relied on them, while suppressing us workers, saying that "Party members and workers are not as obedient as capitalists, easier to manage." They openly asked workers to learn from the capitalists, even saying in meetings to the capitalists, "Let's not talk about politics, you introduce your business experience, and we can learn from it." Look, this is how the capitalist-roaders in our factory peddled the black goods of the big scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices, the theory of the extinction of class struggle.

The capitalist-roaders in our factory, according to Liu Shaoqi's black directives, did everything they could to pull the capitalists into the Party, even letting the capitalists attend Party branch meetings. They did not allow Party members and the broad masses of workers to study Chairman Mao's works, weakening the revolutionary will of Party members and the broad masses of workers to fight against class enemies. They advocated that "good production, good work, obedience, is a good Party member," poisoning some Party members to ignore politics and focus on production. As for those advanced elements of the proletariat who had high awareness of the two-line struggle, strong class struggle consciousness, and dared to fight against class enemies, they were suppressed and attacked, not allowing them to join the Party.

Living class struggle facts tell us that under socialist conditions, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is extremely sharp and complex. The bourgeoisie tries every means to restore the exploitative system of eating people. A small handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party are their agents. Liu Shaoqi fabricated that set of theories of the extinction of class struggle precisely to lull our working class into complacency, helping the bourgeoisie to launch a fierce attack on us, allowing the bourgeoisie to ride on our heads again, and rule arbitrarily. He attempted to turn the proletarian dictatorship we have won under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, after countless sacrifices of blood, into a bourgeois dictatorship, to achieve capitalist restoration in China, making us workers suffer twice and receive twice the punishment, falling back into hell. This is something that will never happen, and we workers will never allow it!

Liu Shaoqi desperately covered up class struggle and vigorously peddled his black goods of the theory of the extinction of class struggle. This precisely shows that he is a thorough traitor and a loyal running dog of the bourgeoisie.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, we workers, through fierce and complex struggles, seized back from the hands of the capitalist-roaders in our factory the part of power they had usurped. Vice Chairman Lin pointed out: "With power, the proletariat and the laboring people have everything. Without power, everything is lost." Without the dictatorship of the proletariat, we workers have nothing. If the bourgeoisie laughs, we workers will cry. Class struggle is a struggle to the death. If we relax, the enemy will attack. We must always remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," thoroughly eliminate the poison of Liu Shaoqi's theory of the extinction of class struggle, consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and make the proletarian iron mountain last forever without changing color.

    彻底埋葬“阶级斗争熄灭论”
    天津三条石衡器厂工人　焦兆海
    党的第八届扩大的十二中全会是一次具有伟大历史意义的会议。全会公报是伟大领袖毛主席的声音，字字句句都说到了我们工人阶级的心坎上，我们一千个拥护，一万个赞成！全会决定，把刘少奇这个工人阶级的死敌永远开除出党，撤消他的党内外一切职务，这表达了我们工人阶级和广大革命人民的心愿，给我们清除了一个最大的祸害，真是大快人心。这都是伟大领袖毛主席英明领导得好啊！
    两年多来的无产阶级文化大革命，充满了极其复杂、极其尖锐的阶级斗争。我一个普通的工人党员，在这场伟大的革命中经受了锻炼和考验，我更深刻地认识到了毛主席关于社会主义社会中的阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争理论的伟大和正确。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“社会主义社会是一个相当长的历史阶段。在社会主义这个历史阶段中，还存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，存在着资本主义复辟的危险性。”毛主席的这一伟大指示，是我们在社会主义条件下进行阶级斗争、巩固无产阶级专政的强大的思想武器。
    长期以来，叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇猖狂反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，大肆鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭论”，胡说什么“无产阶级与资产阶级的主要矛盾也解决了”，“资产阶级也基本上消灭了”，资本家“已经不愿意反抗社会主义了”，他们也可以“入党”了。一句话，阶级和阶级斗争，都没有了。
    我们工人阶级从自己解放前被剥削、被压迫的亲身体会中，从解放后尖锐复杂的阶级斗争实践中，完全懂得刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”是一种什么样的货色！
    在旧社会，天津三条石是工人的一座活地狱。无数徒工一进工厂就被迫立下了“卖身契”，受尽了残酷的剥削和折磨。无数工人在反动资本家的皮鞭下，在阴暗破旧的翻砂棚里，在简陋笨重的机器旁，没有黑夜白日地受资本家的压榨，“早晨五更起，半夜一点睡，深更半夜抡大锤”。在三条石，不知有多少我们的阶级弟兄被榨干了筋血，被赶出了工厂！不知有多少我们的阶级弟兄被活活冻饿而死！
    东方红，太阳升。毛主席他老人家把我们三条石的工人从活地狱里解放了出来。旧社会的牛马成了新社会的主人。我们工人翻了身，资产阶级咬牙切齿，恨得要命，时刻梦想恢复他们已经失去了的天堂。什么“阶级斗争熄灭”了，完全是骗人的鬼话！
    解放以来，阶级斗争哪一天也没有停止过。拿我们厂来说，原来一些剥削欺压我们工人的反动资本家，在党内走资派的包庇、重用下，一度又掌握过生产大权，控制和摆弄我们工人。走资派相信的是资本家，依靠的是资本家，对我们广大工人则进行压制，还胡说什么“党员、工人，不如资本家听话，好使唤”。他们公然要工人拜资本家为师，甚至在会上对资本家说：“咱们不谈政治，你把你做买卖时的经验介绍介绍，我们也好学习学习。”看，我厂的走资派就是这样贩卖大工贼刘少奇及其同伙“阶级斗争熄灭论”的黑货的。
    我们厂的走资派还按照刘少奇的黑指示，千方百计地要把资本家拉入党内，甚至叫资本家参加党支部的会议。他们不许党员和广大工人群众学习毛主席著作，削弱党员和广大工人群众向阶级敌人进行战斗的革命意志，宣扬什么“生产好，工作好，听话，就是好党员”，使一些党员受到毒害，不问政治，埋头生产。而对于那些两条路线斗争觉悟高，阶级斗争观念强，敢于向阶级敌人进行斗争的无产阶级先进分子，却进行排挤和打击，不让他们入党。
    活生生的阶级斗争事实告诉我们，在社会主义条件下，无产阶级和资产阶级之间的斗争是非常尖锐、复杂的。资产阶级千方百计地想恢复吃人的剥削制度，党内一小撮走资派就是他们的代理人。刘少奇编造那一套“阶级斗争熄灭论”，就是为了麻痹我们工人阶级，帮助资产阶级向我们猖狂进攻，让资产阶级重新骑在我们头上，作威作福。他妄图把我们在伟大领袖毛主席领导下，经过无数流血牺牲得来的无产阶级专政，变为资产阶级专政，在中国实现资本主义复辟，使我们工人阶级吃二遍苦，受二遍罪，重新掉进地狱。这是永远也办不到的，我们工人阶级决不答应！
    刘少奇拚命掩盖阶级斗争，极力推销他的“阶级斗争熄灭论”的黑货，这正好说明，他是一个十足的叛徒，是资产阶级的一条忠实走狗。
    在伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们工人经过激烈、复杂的斗争，从我厂走资派的手里夺回了被他们篡夺的那一部分权力。林副主席指出：“有了政权，无产阶级，劳动人民，就有了一切。没有政权，就丧失一切。”没有无产阶级专政，就没有我们工人阶级的一切。资产阶级笑，我们工人阶级就得哭。阶级斗争是你死我活的斗争，我们松一松，敌人就攻一攻。我们必须牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，彻底肃清刘少奇“阶级斗争熄灭论”的流毒，巩固和加强无产阶级专政，使无产阶级的铁打江山，千秋万代永不变色。
