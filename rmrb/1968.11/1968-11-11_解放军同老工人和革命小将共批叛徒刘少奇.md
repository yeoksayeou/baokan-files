Soldiers from the Third Company of a certain unit of the PLA stationed in Tianjin, during the study of the communiqué, invited old workers from the Tianjin Third Woolen Mill and revolutionary youth from Nankai University to the company to hold a criticism meeting, thoroughly denouncing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist trash.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 9th — The soldiers of the Third Company of a certain unit of the PLA stationed in Tianjin have enthusiastically responded to the great battle call issued by the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and together with revolutionary workers and revolutionary youth, launched a powerful revolutionary criticism against the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi. They are determined to thoroughly denounce this faithful running dog of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and his counter-revolutionary revisionist trash, making him a pile of filth despised by all humanity.

The soldiers of this company, during the study of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, further launched a high tide of revolutionary criticism against the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi. In recent days, everyone in the company has written denunciation letters, every squad has held criticism meetings, and special columns for criticism have been set up. They have also successively invited old workers from the Tianjin Third Woolen Mill (formerly Dongya Woolen Mill) and revolutionary youth from Nankai University to the company to hold criticism meetings, jointly denouncing Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes and cleansing the counter-revolutionary revisionist poison spread by Liu Shaoqi. They listened to the revolutionary youth from Nankai University exposing Liu Shaoqi's multiple acts of betraying the party and selling out the revolution, and one by one, they were filled with hatred, repeatedly shouting, "Down with the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi!" Soldier Wang Yishou and others said, Liu Shaoqi is a thorough enemy of the people. He and our revolutionary people have never been on the same path. We must raise high the mighty club of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly expose and criticize this big villain, denounce him thoroughly, and make sure he never rises again.

The old workers from the Third Woolen Mill, with their personal experiences, denounced Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes of favoring capitalists and hating the working class, ruthlessly suppressing the workers' movement. They said, the predecessor of the Third Woolen Mill was the Dongya Woolen Mill. The big boss and capitalist of this mill, Song Qicheng, was a bloodsucking vampire who made his fortune by exploiting workers. After liberation, he should have been punished by the people. However, less than three months after liberation, Liu Shaoqi, this big capitalist-roader, hurriedly came to this mill and sat on the same bench with Song Qicheng, spreading the fallacy of "exploitation is meritorious." Later, he personally wrote a letter to Song Qicheng, encouraging this bloodsucking vampire to strive to expand production and freely exploit workers. The soldiers listened to the workers' blood-curdling denunciations, their chests burning with anger, and raised their fists high, shouting, "Down with the enemy of the working class, Liu Shaoqi!" They said: Chairman Mao teaches us, "There is no love without reason, nor hatred without reason." Liu Shaoqi, this son of a landlord, loves capitalists and hates workers, representing the interests of the reactionary bourgeoisie. He is a faithful running dog of the bourgeoisie!

In the criticism, the soldiers' hatred for Liu Shaoqi deepened. Everyone unanimously expressed their firm support for the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee's decision to permanently expel the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi from the party and revoke all his party and non-party positions, and to continue to settle accounts with Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices' crimes of betraying the party and the country. They said, the decision of the plenum is timely, wise, and correct. It speaks for our revolutionary soldiers' hearts. It proclaims the thorough downfall of Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices. We must respond to the great call of the plenum, continue to deeply launch revolutionary criticism, and thoroughly cleanse the counter-revolutionary revisionist thoughts of Liu Shaoqi and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party.

　　解放军同老工人和革命小将共批叛徒刘少奇
    驻天津部队某部三连指战员在学习公报过程中，请天津第三毛纺厂老工人和南大的革命小将来连队一起开批判会，把刘少奇的反革命修正主义破烂货批得臭不可闻
    新华社天津九日电　人民解放军驻天津部队某部三连指战员，热烈响应党的八届扩大的十二中全会发出的伟大战斗号召，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同革命工人和革命小将一起，对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇展开了声势浩大的革命大批判，决心把这个帝国主义、现代修正主义和国民党反动派的忠实走狗及其贩卖的一套反动透顶的反革命修正主义破烂货，批得臭不可闻，成为不齿于人类的狗屎堆。
    这个连的指战员是在学习党的八届十二中全会公报的过程中，进一步掀起声讨叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的革命大批判的高潮的。连日来，全连人人写了声讨书，班班开了批判会，办了大批判专栏。他们还先后请天津第三毛纺厂（原东亚毛纺厂）老工人和南开大学的革命小将来连队一起开批判会，共同愤怒声讨刘少奇的滔天罪行，肃清刘少奇所散布的反革命修正主义毒菌。他们听了南开大学革命小将揭发刘少奇多次叛党、出卖革命的罪恶活动，一个个恨得咬牙切齿，不断高呼：“打倒叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇！”战士王意修等说，刘少奇是个地地道道的人民公敌，他和咱们革命人民从来走的就不是一条道。我们一定要高举起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，狠揭猛批这个大坏蛋，把他批得臭臭的，叫他永世不得翻身。
    第三毛纺厂的老工人以亲身经历控诉刘少奇对资本家亲、对工人阶级恨，拚命镇压工人运动的滔天罪行。他们说，第三毛纺厂的前身是东亚毛纺厂。这个厂的大洋奴、大资本家宋棐卿是一个靠剥削工人发家的吸血鬼，解放后本应受到人民的惩罚。可是解放不到三个月，刘少奇这个大工贼就匆匆来到这个厂，和宋棐卿坐在一条板凳上，大放“剥削有功”的谬论，以后，他又亲笔写信给宋棐卿，鼓励这个吸血鬼努力扩大生产，放手剥削工人。指战员们听了工人同志的血泪控诉，怒火烧胸，挥动铁拳高呼：“打倒工人阶级的死敌刘少奇！”他们说：毛主席教导我们：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”刘少奇这个出身地主阶级的狗崽子，他爱的是资本家，恨的是工人，代表的是反动资产阶级的利益。他是资产阶级的一条忠实走狗！
    在批判中，指战员们越批对刘少奇的仇恨越深。大家一致表示，坚决拥护党的八届十二中全会把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外一切职务，并继续清算刘少奇及其同伙叛党叛国的罪行的决定。他们说，全会这个决定太及时，太英明，太正确了。它说出了我们革命战士的心里话，它宣告了刘少奇及其同伙的彻底完蛋。我们一定要响应全会的伟大号召，继续深入展开革命大批判，把刘少奇等党内最大的一小撮走资派的反革命修正主义的思想彻底肃清。
