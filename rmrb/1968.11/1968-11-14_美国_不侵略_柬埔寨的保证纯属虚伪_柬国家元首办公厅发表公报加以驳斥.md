The U.S.'s "Non-Aggression" Assurances to Cambodia Are Purely Hypocritical
Cambodian Royal Office Refutes with a Statement

	NEW DELHI, Nov. 13 (Xinhua) — According to a report by the Cambodian News Agency on the 12th, the Royal Office of Cambodia issued a statement on the 12th, refuting the hypocritical assurances made by the U.S. government in a note to the Royal Government of Cambodia.

	In the note to the Royal Government of Cambodia, the U.S. government hypocritically claimed that it had taken all necessary precautions to limit military actions near the Cambodian border and assured that the U.S. military had made every effort to avoid incidents that would cause damage to Cambodia. The statement, after summarizing the incident where U.S. helicopters invaded Cambodian airspace on November 6, killing and injuring 26 Cambodian civilians, emphasized, "The hypocritical assurances made by the U.S. government are in stark contrast to the various crimes committed by the U.S. military against Cambodian civilians. Therefore, the entire Cambodian people are outraged by the arrogant attitude in the U.S. note."

	The statement said, "The recent air raids by the U.S. Air Force on Cambodian territory are clear evidence of the two-faced tactics of U.S. leaders, proving that it is impossible to have any trust in U.S. leaders."

　　美国“不侵略”柬埔寨的保证纯属虚伪
　　柬国家元首办公厅发表公报加以驳斥
    新华社金边十三日电  据柬埔寨新闻社十二日报道，柬埔寨国家元首办公厅十二日发表一项公报，驳斥美国政府在给柬埔寨王国政府的照会中所提出的虚伪保证。
    美国政府在给柬埔寨王国政府的照会中，虚伪地表示什么它已经采取一切预防措施，以限制柬埔寨边境附近的军事行动，并保证美军已竭力避免发生使柬埔寨遭受损失的事件。公报在概述了美国直升飞机十一月六日两次侵入柬埔寨领空打死打伤柬埔寨居民二十六人的侵略事件之后强调指出，“美国政府所提出的伪善保证，同美军对柬埔寨平民犯下的种种罪行对照，是明显的矛盾。”“因此，全体柬埔寨人民对美国照会的蛮横态度感到愤慨。”
    公报说：“美国空军最近对柬埔寨领土的袭击，是美国领导人的两面派手法的明证，已经证明不可能对美国领导人有丝毫的信任。”
