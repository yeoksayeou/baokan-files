The fundamental question of the revolution is the question of political power. In his report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, our great leader Chairman Mao clearly addressed the fundamental issue of the proletariat seizing and consolidating political power nationwide. At that time, we were on the verge of achieving national victory. After seizing political power, could we consolidate it? How would we consolidate it? Chairman Mao provided clear answers to these questions in this report.

Chairman Mao taught us: "We must learn to wage political, economic, and cultural struggles against the imperialists, the Kuomintang, and the bourgeoisie in the cities, and diplomatic struggles against the imperialists. We must learn to fight them openly and secretly. If we do not pay attention to these issues, do not learn to fight these people in these ways, and do not achieve victory in these struggles, we will not be able to maintain political power, we will not be able to stand firm, and we will fail." Chairman Mao profoundly expounded the laws of class struggle and pointed out the new characteristics and trends of class struggle in the new situation. The practice of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines over the past nineteen years has fully proven that Chairman Mao's judgments are extraordinarily wise and correct.

The history of the past nineteen years is the history of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses continuing to wage political, economic, and cultural struggles against the imperialists, the Kuomintang, and the bourgeoisie after the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The imperialists and the reactionaries at home and abroad are unwilling to accept their defeat. In addition to openly engaging in sabotage and disruption, they have adopted the policy of "Sun Wukong entering the belly of Princess Iron Fan to cause trouble," using their agents within our party and state power organs to promote a counter-revolutionary revisionist line that suits their needs, attempting to achieve a capitalist restoration in China and drag China back into darkness. The number one capitalist-roader in the party, Liu Shaoqi, is a loyal running dog of the domestic and foreign reactionaries who has infiltrated our party. This great traitor and his clique, using the part of the political power they have usurped, have vigorously promoted capitalist restoration activities. A handful of capitalist-roaders who have infiltrated the party in our county and commune, following the orders of their master Liu Shaoqi, have used the banner of restoring and developing production to vigorously promote Liu Shaoqi's advocacy of "self-management, self-reliance, and self-sufficiency," "dividing land to households," and "dividing livestock to households," and other black goods aimed at restoring capitalism, crazily sabotaging the collective economy. They also use the banner of "strengthening unity" to vigorously promote Liu Shaoqi's theory of "the extinction of class struggle," sheltering and promoting bad elements, and conspiring to change the situation.

The practice of class struggle has made us deeply realize: political power is the right to exist, the right to life. With political power, the proletariat and the laboring people have everything; without political power, they lose everything. We must always remember the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao. No matter how complex the situation, we must never forget political power. Although the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has reclaimed part of the political power usurped by a handful of capitalist-roaders, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie over seizing and counter-seizing power has not ended, and the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines will continue for a long time. To re-study this extremely important report by Chairman Mao and learn from the historical experience of the two-line struggle in our party, we must firmly remember this point.

    永远不要忘记政权
    河北省青县邓庄子公社革委会主任  李玉如
    革命的根本问题是政权问题。伟大领袖毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告，就是讲的无产阶级在全国夺取政权和巩固政权这个根本问题。当时，我们即将取得全国的胜利。夺取了政权以后，能不能巩固？怎样巩固？毛主席在这篇报告里，对这些问题作了十分明确的回答。
    毛主席教导我们：“必须学会在城市中向帝国主义者、国民党、资产阶级作政治斗争、经济斗争和文化斗争，并向帝国主义者作外交斗争。既要学会同他们作公开的斗争，又要学会同他们作荫蔽的斗争。如果我们不去注意这些问题，不去学会同这些人作这些斗争，并在斗争中取得胜利，我们就不能维持政权，我们就会站不住脚，我们就会失败。”毛主席极其深刻地阐明了阶级斗争的规律，指出了在新的形势下，阶级斗争的新特点、新动向。十九年来阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的实践，完全证明了毛主席的论断无比英明，无比正确。
    十九年来的历史，就是无产阶级专政建立之后，工人阶级和广大革命群众继续同帝国主义者、国民党、资产阶级进行政治斗争、经济斗争和文化斗争的历史。帝国主义者和国内外反动派，决不甘心他们的失败，他们为了篡夺人民的政权，除了明火执仗地进行破坏和捣乱以外，还“采用孙行者钻进铁扇公主肚子里兴妖作怪的政策”，利用他们在我们党内和国家政权机构内的代理人，推行一条适应他们需要的反革命修正主义路线，妄图在中国实现资本主义复辟，重新把中国引向黑暗。党内头号走资派刘少奇，就是一个钻进我们党内的国内外反动派的忠实走狗。这个大叛徒和他的一伙，利用被他们窃取的部分政权，大搞资本主义复辟活动。混入我县和我公社党内的一小撮走资派，就秉承其主子刘少奇的旨意，打着恢复和发展生产的旗号，极力推行刘少奇鼓吹的“三自一包”，“分田到户”，“分畜到户”等复辟资本主义的黑货，疯狂破坏集体经济。他们还打着“加强团结”的旗号，极力鼓吹刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，包庇重用坏人，拼凑反革命势力，阴谋变天。
    阶级斗争的实践，使我们深深体会到：政权就是生存权、生命权。有了政权，无产阶级、劳动人民就有了一切；没有政权，就丧失一切。我们一定要牢记伟大领袖毛主席的教导，无论怎样千头万绪，永远不要忘记政权。无产阶级文化大革命虽然夺回了被一小撮走资派篡夺去的一部分政权，但是，无产阶级和资产阶级之间的夺权和反夺权的斗争并没有结束，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争还将长期继续下去。重新学习毛主席这篇极为重要的报告，学习我们党的两条路线斗争的历史经验，就要牢牢地记住这一点。
