The reactionary film "Visit to Indonesia" is a black monument painstakingly erected by the traitor, spy, and saboteur Liu Shaoqi to glorify himself. It is also an ironclad piece of evidence of his betrayal of the party, the nation, and the proletarian revolution.

In this film, Liu Shaoqi portrays himself as the "great envoy" of the Chinese people, falsely claiming that his treacherous acts were "great achievements" in promoting friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples.

"Fake is fake, and the disguise must be stripped away." Let us examine two such scenes, one on the screen and one off the screen:

On the screen, Liu Shaoqi bows down before the leading figures of the Indonesian bourgeoisie, fraternizing with fascist reactionary soldiers, shaking hands and exchanging greetings. When he meets butchers like Nasution, who have blood on their hands, he winks and smiles, becoming thick as thieves. Not only does he shake hands warmly, but he also expresses concern, wishing them to "take care of their health."

What attitude did Liu Shaoqi adopt towards the Indonesian people? There is an incident that was not filmed: When Liu Shaoqi was about to return to China, an Indonesian worker, out of boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and sincere friendship with the Chinese people, wanted to shake hands with Liu Shaoqi to say goodbye. Liu Shaoqi immediately revealed his true colors as a saboteur, arrogantly declaring, "I am the Chairman of the State. Why should I shake hands!"

From these two scenes of shaking hands and not shaking hands, we can clearly see Liu Shaoqi's love and hate: he loves the Indonesian bourgeoisie reactionaries and hates the broad revolutionary people of Indonesia. He was not promoting unity between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples in Indonesia; instead, he was following the world's largest group of saboteurs—the Soviet modern revisionists—to collude with the Indonesian reactionaries and extinguish the flames of the Indonesian people's revolutionary struggle.

This treacherous act is nothing new for Liu Shaoqi, the great saboteur. As early as 1922, when the workers of Anyuan Coal Mine, following the teachings of Chairman Mao, were fighting with increasing fervor, was it not the saboteur Liu Shaoqi who, using "civilized strikes" and "don't cause trouble," collaborated with the reactionaries to suppress the workers' movement? In 1927, at the critical moment of the first domestic revolutionary war, when the workers' revolutionary movement in Hubei Province was thriving and developing, Liu Shaoqi, as the Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, colluded with the warlords and bureaucrats to suppress our workers' movement, disband our workers' picket teams, and order the surrender of guns and ammunition. As a result, when the Kuomintang reactionaries launched a counter-revolutionary rebellion, our workers were unarmed and defenseless, suffering a bloody massacre. This time, the great saboteur Liu Shaoqi visited Indonesia and became thick as thieves with the Indonesian reactionaries, betraying the interests of the Indonesian working class and laboring people.

Liu Shaoqi is a criminal who serves imperialism, modern revisionism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries. He is a traitor, spy, and saboteur hidden within the party. He and his accomplices, in order to contend with the proletariat for power, inevitably harbor hatred towards revolutionary masses both domestically and internationally, and fiercely suppress the revolutionary struggles of the people.

The Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, in a political sense, has sentenced the great traitor, spy, and saboteur Liu Shaoqi to death. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We, the working class, firmly support the decision to expel Liu Shaoqi from the party permanently and to strip him of all his positions within and outside the party. We resolutely respond to the great call of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, carrying the great criticism to the end, thoroughly criticizing and exposing Liu Shaoqi's reactionary revisionist thoughts along with the reactionary film "Visit to Indonesia," and eliminating all its poisonous influences. Let the black monument of the great traitor Liu Shaoqi go to hell!

    反动影片《访问印度尼西亚》，是大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇为了吹捧自己所苦心经营的一块黑碑，也是他叛党叛国、背叛无产阶级革命的一个铁证。
    在这部影片里，刘少奇把自己打扮成中国人民的“伟大使者”，硬把他的叛徒行径说成是促进中国和印尼人民友好的“丰功伟绩”。
    “假的就是假的，伪装应当剥去。”让我们来看看银幕上和银幕外的这样两个镜头：
    在银幕上，刘少奇拜倒在印尼资产阶级头面人物脚下，和法西斯反动军人拉拉扯扯，握手言欢。当他见到双手沾满人民鲜血的刽子手纳苏蒂安之流的时候，眉来眼去，打得火热。不但紧紧地握手表示亲热，还关怀地祝愿他“保重身体”。
    刘少奇对印尼人民采取的又是什么度态呢？有这样一件事，是没有拍进电影的：当刘少奇将要回国的时候，一位印尼工人出于对伟大导师毛主席的无限热爱，出于对中国人民的真挚友谊，要求和刘少奇握手告别，刘少奇立刻露出了大工贼的狰狞面目，竟然狂妄地说：“我是国家主席，握什么手！”
    从这两个握手和不握手的小镜头，我们清楚地看出了刘少奇的爱和恨：他爱的是印尼资产阶级反动派，恨的是印尼广大革命人民。他在印尼根本不是促进中国和印尼人民的团结，而是追随世界上最大的工贼集团——苏联现代修正主义集团去勾结印尼反动派，扑灭印尼人民的革命斗争烈火。
    这种叛卖行径，对于刘少奇这个大工贼来说，并不是什么新鲜事。早在一九二二年，安源煤矿工人遵照毛主席的教导，斗争烈火越烧越旺时，不正是工贼刘少奇用“文明罢工”“不要瞎搞乱动”和反动派一起镇压工人运动的吗？一九二七年，正当第一次国内革命战争中革命与反革命大搏斗的紧急关头，湖北省的工人革命运动轰轰烈烈，蓬勃发展，刘少奇在武汉却以湖北省总工会秘书长的身分，和军阀官僚勾结在一起镇压我们工人运动，解散我们工人纠察队，下令把枪枝弹药拱手交出；以致国民党反动派发动反革命叛变时，我们工人赤手空拳、手无寸铁，遭到血腥屠杀。这次大工贼刘少奇访问印尼，又和印尼反动派打得火热，出卖了印尼工人阶级和劳动人民的利益。
    刘少奇是罪恶累累的帝国主义、现代修正主义和国民党反动派的走狗，是一个埋藏在党内的叛徒、内奸、工贼。他和他的同伙为了同无产阶级争夺政权，必然地仇视国内外革命群众，疯狂地镇压人民群众的革命斗争。
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会，在政治上宣判了大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇的死刑。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。我们工人阶级坚决拥护把刘少奇永远开除出党，并撤消他党内外一切职务的决定。我们坚决响应党的八届扩大的十二中全会的伟大号召，把革命的大批判进行到底，把刘少奇的一切反革命修正主义思想连同反动影片《访问印度尼西亚》一起，彻底批倒批臭，肃清它的一切流毒。让大叛徒刘少奇的这块黑碑见鬼去吧！
