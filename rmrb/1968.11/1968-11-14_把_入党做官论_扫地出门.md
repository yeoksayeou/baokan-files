	Sweep Away the "Join the Party to Become an Official" Theory
	Worker Wang Shichang, Dan Dong Pharmaceutical Factory, Liaoning Province

	Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "We Communists are not seeking office, but are seeking revolution. We must have a thorough spirit of revolution. We must never for a moment detach ourselves from the masses." Chairman Mao's wise teachings have struck a chord in my heart. We Communist Party members should dedicate our lives to revolutionary struggle and sacrifice ourselves for the revolution. We should wholeheartedly serve the people and strive for the magnificent cause of communism throughout our lives.

	The traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi deliberately corrupts the souls of Party members and shamelessly peddles the reactionary "join the Party to become an official" theory. He blathers on about how "in the past, one took the imperial examination to become a scholar, now one takes the examination to join the Communist Party," and "in the past, passing the examination to become a scholar meant becoming an official, now joining the Communist Party also means becoming an official." He brazenly advocates the idea of becoming an official and living like a lord.

	The question of whether to become an official and live like a lord or to be a servant of the people is the touchstone for distinguishing true revolutionaries from false ones. Communist Party members armed with Mao Zedong Thought, from the day they join the Party, dedicate their lives to the revolution and to the Party. Such Communist Party members have only one thought: wholeheartedly for the revolution, wholeheartedly for the people, and unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao; they have only one goal: to liberate all of humanity and to carry the Chinese revolution and the world revolution through to the end. Heroes like Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Li Wenzhong, Jiao Ruyu, and Meng He are such Communist Party members. Their heroic deeds are the most powerful refutation of Liu Shaoqi's "join the Party to become an official" theory and are also the examples for every Communist Party member to learn from.

	I joined the Communist Party of China in 1949. From the day I joined, I dedicated my life to the revolution and to the Party, determined to be a servant of the people for life. Over the past twenty years, under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, I have moved from the military to the local area, from the countryside to the factory, from a gunner to a cook, from a peasant to a worker. My job has changed many times, but my spirit of serving the people has not changed, and my red heart loyal to Chairman Mao has not changed. When I see colleagues who have worked with me or who joined the revolution later than me taking on positions such as section chief or workshop director, I think this is a division of labor in the revolution and a need of the work. The faster their political awareness improves and the more they contribute to the revolution, the happier I am. Someone asked me, "Old Wang, you have worked hard at the revolution for so many years, why are you still just an ordinary worker?" At first, hearing these rumors, I had some fluctuations in my thoughts, but I immediately realized that this was the bourgeois "self" at work. I then opened my red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and studied it repeatedly, comparing it to my own thoughts. Chairman Mao teaches us: "All our cadres, regardless of their rank, are servants of the people, and everything we do is for the people." Chairman Mao's words are like a bright lamp illuminating my heart. I thought: I am a cowherd by origin, and it is Mao Zedong Thought that has nurtured me to grow. I am a Communist Party member and a member of the working class. To be a faithful servant of the people is my duty, and to be a loyal ordinary worker to Chairman Mao is my honor. I should always do this.

	The great traitor Liu Shaoqi's evil purpose in vigorously promoting the "join the Party to become an official" theory is to attempt to use fame, wealth, and position as bait to lure our Party members to degenerate into bourgeois individualists, to become his docile tools for counter-revolution, to make our Party degenerate into a revisionist party, and to make our country take the capitalist road. The great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has already turned Liu Shaoqi's evil plot into a forever unrealizable dream.

	I will certainly enthusiastically respond to the great call of the Party's Twelfth Plenum, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi's "philosophy of selfishness," and firmly establish the proletarian worldview of selflessly serving the public. I will be a proletarian vanguard fighter who is unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao, unconditionally loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. I will be a servant of the people who serves the public, serves everything, and serves for life.

### 把“入党做官论”扫地出门

　　把“入党做官论”扫地出门
　　辽宁省丹东制药厂工人　王世昌
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命，我们人人要有彻底的革命精神，我们不要有一时一刻脱离群众。”毛主席的这一英明教导，字字说到了我的心坎里。我们共产党员就是要生为革命战斗，死为革命献身，全心全意地为人民服务，为实现壮丽的共产主义事业奋斗终生。
    刘少奇这个叛徒、内奸、工贼，蓄意腐蚀党员的灵魂，无耻地兜售反动的“入党做官论”。他胡说什么：“过去是考秀才，现在是考共产党员”，“过去考上秀才就可以做官，现在加入了共产党，也可以做官”。他赤裸裸地鼓吹做官当老爷的思想。
    是做官当老爷，还是当人民的勤务员，是鉴别真革命还是假革命的试金石。用毛泽东思想武装起来的共产党员，从入党那天起，就把自己的一生交给革命，交给党。这样的共产党员只有一个思想，就是一心为革命，一心为人民，无限忠于毛主席；只有一个奋斗目标，就是解放全人类，把中国革命和世界革命进行到底。雷锋、王杰、李文忠、焦裕禄、门合等英雄人物，就是这样的共产党员。他们的英雄事迹，是对刘少奇“入党做官论”的最有力的批判，也是我们每一个共产党员学习的榜样。
    我是在一九四九年加入中国共产党的。从入党那天起，我就把我的一生交给了革命，交给了党，决心当一辈子人民的勤务员。二十年来，在毛泽东思想哺育下，我从部队到地方，从农村到工厂，从炮手到炊事员，从农民到工人，工作岗位不断变，但为人民服务的思想没有变，忠于毛主席的红心没有变。当我看到和我一起工作过的同志或比我晚参加革命的同志担任了科长、车间主任等职务，我认为这是革命的分工，工作的需要。他们政治觉悟提高越快，为革命贡献越大，我就越高兴。有人问我：“老王头，你兢兢业业干了这么多年革命，怎么还是个普通工人呢？”开始时，听了这些风言风语，，思想上也有些波动，但我马上意识到这是资产阶级“私”字在作怪。我便翻开红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，反复学习，反复对照。毛主席教导我们说：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务”。毛主席的话象一盏明灯照亮了我的心。我想：我是放牛娃出身，是毛泽东思想哺育我不断成长。我是共产党员，是工人阶级的一员，做人民的忠实勤务员，是我的本分，当忠于毛主席的普通工人，是我的光荣。我应该永远这样做。
    大叛徒刘少奇大肆宣扬“入党做官论”的罪恶目的，就是妄图用名利地位作诱饵，引诱我们的党员蜕变为资产阶级的个人主义者，去做他的反革命的驯服工具，使我们的党蜕变为修正主义的党，使我们的国家走到资本主义的邪道上去。无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，已经使刘少奇的这一罪恶阴谋变成了永远不会实现的南柯一梦。
    我一定热烈响应党的十二中全会的伟大号召，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，大破刘少奇的“唯私哲学”，大立一心为公的无产阶级世界观，做一个无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的无产阶级先锋战士，做一个一心为公、一切为公、一生为公的人民勤务员。
