Edition: 2

The revolutionary workers of the Casting Plant of the First Automobile Works in Changchun are actively responding to the call of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. They are continuing to carry out the great criticism and struggle, thoroughly purging the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionism of Liu Shaoqi and a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. This is a scene of the militia and the propaganda team of the Red Ninth Company stationed in the factory together exposing the heinous crimes of Liu Shaoqi's betrayal of the Party.
