When we discussed Comrades Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu's suggestion to "transfer public primary schools to the management of production brigades," some comrades were concerned that if public primary schools were transferred to production brigades, students would spend more time on labor and less time on academic studies, which might affect the "quality of education." I would like to share some of my views and experiences on this issue.

The issue of "quality of education" can be viewed from two different standpoints, leading to two completely different opinions. From the standpoint of the revisionist educational line, one might think that "high or low test scores," "high or low admission rates," and "the amount of book knowledge" are the standards for measuring "quality of education." From the standpoint of Mao Zedong's proletarian educational line, one would think that whether the students trained in schools can wholeheartedly serve the people and serve proletarian politics is the only correct standard for measuring "quality of education."

Take, for example, the students trained in the Donggang Private Primary School in Donggang Township, Duerbet Mongol Autonomous County, Heilongjiang Province, where I was before joining the army. Every one of them is a young person that poor and lower-middle peasants genuinely like. Donggang Primary School conducts its teaching work under the direct leadership of the brigade party branch. Poor and lower-middle peasants, in order to personally raise their next generation to be reliable revolutionary successors, specially allocated more than ten acres of "anti-revisionist fields" to the school and arranged for "labor classes" every day. During the busy farming season, they let the students participate in the labor of the production teams. When building school buildings, the children also carried bricks and tiles. When desks and chairs were broken, they learned to repair them themselves. From a young age, they underwent tempering and maintained the character of the working people. They had less time for classes, but less time for "closed-door book-reading classes," more time for class education, and more classes on studying Chairman Mao's works. The school often invited old poor peasants who had suffered greatly to give students lessons on remembering bitterness and thinking of sweetness, and organized them to visit class education exhibitions, study village history, and family history, etc. The children learned from a young age what exploitation and oppression were, and planted the roots of class and class struggle in their young hearts. The students read books according to the textbooks compiled in line with Chairman Mao's educational line. The students who graduated from this primary school listened to Chairman Mao's words the most and acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions. After graduation, they actively participated in the three great revolutionary movements. One graduating class, the brigade wanted to retain some students to be instructors and accountants for studying Chairman Mao's works, and all the students in the class eagerly volunteered. Poor and lower-middle peasants often praised, "The young people trained by Donggang Primary School are our own poor and lower-middle peasants'." Is this "quality of education" high or low? We believe that the "quality of education" is very high.

However, in 1962, one fourth-grade class of our Donggang Primary School was ordered by the county education bureau to merge into the public Dongsheng Primary School, and five children of poor and lower-middle peasants were expelled from school because they could not afford the tuition fees and their grades were not up to standard. Even the students who did not drop out of school gradually changed after entering the public primary school. There was a student named Wang Lin. When he was in the private Donggang Primary School, he was such a good child! After school, he either collected manure for the team or chopped firewood for the five-guarantee households, loving the collective and labor, often using his rest time to help the production team with work, and did not let them record his work points. Poor and lower-middle peasants praised him as a "little five-good member." However, after entering the public primary school, he soon became a bookworm, with his mind full of scores. Before, he helped his parents study Chairman Mao's works every evening. After entering the "public" primary school, he came home every day to either recite books or do math problems. When his family asked him to do some chores, he was afraid it would affect his studies. His father angrily said, "How did our child change so quickly!" Look, this is the "quality of education" of the public primary school!

What kind of vine produces what kind of grapes, and what kind of school under what kind of line will train what kind of people. The great traitor Liu Shaoqi, in order to achieve his evil goal of restoring capitalism, frantically seized the educational front, using the name of "improving the quality of education" to cut down private primary schools, attempting to train the next generation of poor and lower-middle peasants into successors of the bourgeoisie. Comrades Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu's suggestion is a good suggestion to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instruction that "in the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants." It is a good suggestion to train successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

### 我们不要修正主义的“教学质量”——公办变民办会影响“教学质量”吗？

    我们不要修正主义的“教学质量”
    ——公办变民办会影响“教学质量”吗？
    我们在讨论侯振民、王庆余两同志关于“公办小学下放到大队来办”的建议时，有的同志认为少年时代正是学文化、长知识的时候，因而担心公办小学下放到大队来办，劳动的时间多了，学习功课的时间少了，是否会影响到“教学质量”。现在对这个问题，谈谈我的一些看法和体会。
    关于“教学质量”的问题，站在两种不同的立场上，就会有两种截然不同的看法。站在修正主义教育路线的立场上，就会认为“分数高低”、“升学率高低”、“书本知识的多少”是衡量“教学质量”的标准；站在毛主席无产阶级教育路线的立场上，就会认为，从学校里培养出来的人，能否全心全意地为人民服务，为无产阶级政治服务，才是衡量“教学质量”的唯一正确的标准。
    就拿我入伍前所在的黑龙江省杜尔伯特蒙古族自治县东岗民办小学培养的学生来说吧，个个都是贫下中农打心眼里喜欢的后生。东岗小学是在大队党支部的直接领导下进行教学工作的。贫下中农为了亲手把自己的后一代培养成为可靠的革命接班人，专门给小学拨了十几亩“防修田”，每天都有“劳动课”。到了农忙季节，就让学生参加生产队的劳动。修建校舍，孩子们也搬砖运瓦。桌凳坏了，他们自己学着钉。他们从小就经受着锻炼，保持劳动人民的本色。他们上课的时间少了，是上“闭门死读书”课的时间少了，而上阶级教育课的时间多了，学习毛主席著作的课多了。学校里经常请苦大仇深的老贫农给学生进行忆苦思甜教育，并且组织他们参观阶级教育展览，学习村史、家史等等。孩子们从小就懂得什么叫剥削，什么叫压迫，在幼小的心灵里就扎下了阶级和阶级斗争的根子。学生读的书是按照毛主席教育路线自编的课本。从这所小学毕业出来的学生，最听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，毕业后积极投入到三大革命运动中去。有一期毕业生，大队想留下一部分人，当学习毛主席著作的辅导员和记工员，全班同学都争先恐后地报名。贫下中农常常称赞说：“东岗小学培养的后生是咱贫下中农自己的。”这“教学质量”是高还是低呢？我们认为“教学质量”是很高的。
    但是，在一九六二年，我们东岗小学一个四年级班被县文教局下令合并到公办的东升小学去了，有五名贫下中农的子女因为缴不起学费，成绩不合格，被撵出了学校。就是没有失学的学生，到了公办小学后，也慢慢地变了。有个叫汪林的同学，在民办东岗小学的时候，是个多么好的孩子啊！他放学回家后，不是给队里拾粪，就是给五保户打柴，热爱集体，热爱劳动，常常利用休息时间帮助生产队干活，还不让给自己记工分。贫下中农夸奖他是个“小五好社员”。可是到了公办小学后，不久就变成了个书呆子，满脑子的分数。以前，他每天晚上帮助爸爸妈妈学习毛主席著作，到了“公办”小学后，每天回来不是背书，就是算题，家里让他干点活，他怕耽误了功课。他父亲气愤地说：“咱这孩子变得怎么这么快！”大家看，这就是公办小学的“教学质量”！
    什么藤上结什么瓜，什么样的路线控制下的学校就会培养出什么样的人来。大叛徒刘少奇为了实现他复辟资本主义的罪恶目的，疯狂地争夺教育阵地，以“提高教学质量”为名，大砍民办小学，妄图把贫下中农的后代培养成为资产阶级的接班人。侯振民、王庆余两同志的建议，是一个全面落实毛主席最新指示“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校”的好建议，是一个培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的好建议。解放军某部  吴财
