Private schools are indeed good. I, Fan Zhongxing, a poor peasant from Zhangyin Village, Guangzong County, Hebei Province, want to say a few words about this.

When it comes to Liu Shaoqi, that traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader, it makes us poor and lower-middle peasants so angry that our teeth ache. This is because he usurped the right to education, preventing us from rising culturally. I am illiterate, and for generations, no one in my family has been able to read or write. We have lived our entire lives in ignorance. After liberation, a school was established in our village. It should have been the time for us poor and lower-middle peasants to rise culturally. However, Liu Shaoqi, in opposition to our great leader Chairman Mao, vigorously promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, advocating "intellectual education first" and implementing the "score-first" policy. These barriers have caused immense suffering for us poor and lower-middle peasants.

My eldest son, Wen Bing, was in elementary school. To help with household chores, he would return home from school to gather firewood and do some work, missing some of his studies. When the exam results were posted, he was ranked last. The teacher would call him early in the morning to recite texts, and he had to recite entire passages. My child often missed out, couldn't recite them, and was frequently scolded, punished to stand, and sometimes even beaten. This way, he couldn't pass the score barrier. After more than a year, he was labeled a "naughty and bad student" and was expelled from school. Whenever I think of Liu Shaoqi and his gang calling our poor and lower-middle peasants' children "bad students," it makes my eyes spark with anger. This is a disgrace to us poor and lower-middle peasants. My eldest son couldn't continue his studies, so I sent my second son, Wen Ke, to school. However, after graduating from primary school, because he didn't pass the entrance exam for middle school, he too was expelled. When my third son finished primary school and it was time for the middle school entrance exam, they simply rejected him because he was too old and tall. Age and height also became conditions for admission to school—what nonsense! This is how they used every possible means to keep our poor and lower-middle peasants' children out of school.

The traitor Liu Shaoqi deprived us poor and lower-middle peasants of our right to education, intending to keep us in a state of cultural illiteracy and subjugation, so as to realize his dream of restoring capitalism. After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, we carried out an educational revolution. Admission to schools was no longer based on exams or scores but mainly on political stance. This way, my fourth son, Wen Ling, was recommended to attend high school in Guangzong City. However, new problems arose. The school was far from home, and after two months, it cost us more than ten yuan. Just as we were feeling the strain and seeking a solution, it was Chairman Mao who solved the problem. Chairman Mao instructed, "In the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants." This allowed us poor and lower-middle peasants to truly grasp the power of education. Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we established the principle that peasant children should study nearby and return home to work after graduation. We set up junior and senior high school classes in our own village, managed by the poor and lower-middle peasants. My son Wen Ling returned to the village to attend high school. Chairman Mao always thinks of us poor and lower-middle peasants. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, respond to the great call of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, and carry out a thorough and extensive revolutionary criticism. We will smash Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, manage the schools well, and complete the great task of the educational revolution.

    民办学校就是好
    河北省广宗县张尹村大队贫农社员　樊中行
    提起刘少奇这个叛徒、内奸、工贼，就气得我们贫下中农牙根痛，就是因为他篡夺了教育权，使我们贫下中农在文化上翻不了身。我不识字，我们家上几辈子也没有一个识字的，成年累月地过着睁眼瞎的日子。解放后村里有了学校，本该我们贫下中农在文化上翻身了。可是刘少奇跟我们伟大领袖毛主席唱对台戏，大力推行反革命修正主义教育路线，鼓吹“智育第一”，实行“分数挂帅”，一道道关卡，害苦了我们贫下中农。
    我大儿子文丙，上小学时，为了顾家里活，下学回家就帮助拾点柴禾、做点活，耽误了些功夫，考试贴榜，考了个倒数第一。学校老师每天早起叫背书，一背就是通篇，咱孩子不断耽误，背不下来，挨骂、罚立正是常事，有时还挨打。就这样分数关过不了，上了一年多，说是“调皮坏学生”，便给关在学校外边。现在我想起刘少奇这一伙说我们贫下中农是坏学生，就气得我眼里直冒火星子，这是对我们贫下中农的污辱。我老大没上得了学，叫二儿子文科上学，可是上到了高小毕业，因为没考上中学，过不了升学关，又给关在学校外边。等老三文章上完了小学，到考高小时，又嫌他岁数大，个子高，就干脆不要。人的岁数、个子也成了上学的条件，真是奇谈！就这样，他们想尽各种办法把我们贫下中农的孩子关在学校外边。
    叛徒刘少奇剥夺我们贫下中农享受教育的权利，目的就是使贫下中农永远处于没文化被统治的地位，以便实现他复辟资本主义的美梦。无产阶级文化大革命开始以后，在毛主席他老人家的英明领导下，开展教育革命，升学不考，不依分数，主要看思想，这样我的第四个儿子文岭被保送上了广宗城里的高中。可是新问题又来了，学校离家远，上了两个月就花了十几块钱。就在我们感到困难要求解决问题的时候，还是毛主席他老人家给解决了。毛主席指示说：“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”让我们贫下中农真正掌握了文权。我们贫下中农，按照毛主席教导的农民子女就近上学，将来毕业以后，好回家生产的原则，在本村办起了由贫下中农管理的初中班、高中班，俺文岭回到村里上了高中。毛主席他老人家时刻想着我们贫下中农，我们一定紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，响应八届十二中全会的伟大号召，深入广泛地展开革命大批判，彻底砸烂刘少奇的反革命修正主义教育路线，管理好学校，完成教育革命的伟大任务。
