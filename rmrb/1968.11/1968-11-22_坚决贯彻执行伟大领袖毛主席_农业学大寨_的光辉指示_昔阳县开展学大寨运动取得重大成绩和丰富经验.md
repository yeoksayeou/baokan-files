In the great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary committee of Xiyang County in Shanxi Province has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's brilliant directive of "Agriculture Learns from Dazhai," and firmly grasped class struggle. They have carried out a thorough and sustained criticism of the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi and his agents, and launched a mass movement to learn from Dazhai across the county. This movement has achieved great successes and accumulated rich experiences.

After the revolutionary committee of Xiyang County was established in February last year, it quickly led the revolutionary people of the entire county to launch the mass movement to learn from Dazhai. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members, taking the people of Dazhai as their example, placed the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, prior to everything, and more important than everything. They studied and applied it in struggle, raising their consciousness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines to an unprecedented level. They smashed the bourgeois "self" and established the proletarian "public," fostering the thought of farming for revolution. Thousands upon thousands of new-type socialist farmers who wholeheartedly serve the revolution emerged. Because the broad masses of commune members established the thought of farming for revolution, all 415 production brigades in the county fully promoted the labor management system of Dazhai Brigade, which emphasizes proletarian politics and public-spirited labor. This brought about a profound socialist revolution in rural management. The broad masses of grassroots cadres in the countryside, taking Comrade Chen Yonggui as their example, fearlessly faced hardships and difficulties, dared to make revolution and struggle, and wholeheartedly served the poor and lower-middle peasants. Over the past two years of learning from Dazhai, agricultural production in the county has developed rapidly. Last year, the total grain output increased by 43 percent compared to 1966, the highest in history, and exceeded the state procurement quota by 7.4 percent. This year, despite suffering from drought, pests, hail, wind, and floods, the broad revolutionary masses displayed the revolutionary spirit of the people of Dazhai in fighting against nature, overcoming natural disasters, and achieving another bumper harvest.

The victory of the power seizure struggle by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat is the fundamental prerequisite for the vigorous development of the mass movement to learn from Dazhai. After the revolutionary committee of Xiyang County was established, it immediately decided to launch the mass movement to learn from Dazhai across the county. The county revolutionary committee believed that the red flag of Dazhai, personally raised by Chairman Mao, is an advanced collective in our rural areas under the dictatorship of the proletariat and a shining example for carrying out socialist revolution and socialist construction in our rural areas. They regarded leading the movement to learn from Dazhai as an important task of the revolutionary committee and took learning from Dazhai as an important content of the struggle, criticism, and transformation in rural areas during the Proletarian Cultural Revolution, thus closely linking learning from Dazhai with the struggle, criticism, and transformation in rural areas. Their specific approach was as follows:

First, they held high the great banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, carried out thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, and used revolutionary criticism as a driving force to promote learning from Dazhai. Chairman Mao taught us: "One of our important tasks on the ideological front at present is to carry out a criticism of revisionism." Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Xiyang County, during the period when our country suffered three consecutive years of severe natural disasters and temporary economic difficulties, vigorously promoted counter-revolutionary revisionist goods, attempting to turn Xiyang County into a base for their capitalist restoration. This was the biggest obstacle to the movement to learn from Dazhai. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Xiyang County, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and taking Dazhai as their example, closely linked with the actual class struggle and the struggle between the two lines in their locality, conducted reminiscences, comparisons, and criticisms. They first saw how Chairman Mao said it, how the people of Dazhai acted according to Chairman Mao's teachings, and how their own production team did it; then they saw how Liu Shaoqi poisoned, how the people of Dazhai resisted with Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, and whether their own production team resisted or was poisoned. In this way, they clearly remembered the past of their own village and production team, period by period, compared and contrasted with Dazhai, found the gaps and problems, and then they compared the problems they found with Liu Shaoqi's advocacy of the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies such as "the theory of the extinction of class struggle," "three freedoms and one contract," "four freedoms," "work points as the commander," "material incentives," "the Peach Garden experience," and "the theory of the fusion of public and private." They followed the problems, presented facts, discussed harms, followed the clues to hang the accounts on the reactionaries, complained to the reactionaries, and settled accounts with the reactionaries, digging out the roots and aiming directly at Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Shanxi. Such criticism made the broad masses of commune members see clearly, touch concretely, hit accurately, and criticize thoroughly, feeling deeply educated and more enthusiastic. They hated Liu Shaoqi more and more, hated the bourgeois reactionary line more and more; they loved the great leader Chairman Mao more and more, loved Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line more and more; they had greater confidence in learning from Dazhai and more enthusiasm for walking the path of Dazhai.

Second, they eliminated the poison of a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party who distorted, belittled, and opposed Dazhai, educating the broad masses of commune members that learning from Dazhai means learning the essence, learning the ideology, and learning the spirit. What to learn from Dazhai and how to learn it is a sharp class struggle. They used the despicable means of setting up false models to suppress Dazhai, trying in every possible way to distort, belittle, and slander the spirit and experience of Dazhai, attempting to demolish the red flag of Dazhai. The distortion and slander of the spirit and experience of Dazhai by a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party had deep poison in the countryside. In some places, learning from Dazhai was not about learning from the people of Dazhai to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought actively, emphasizing proletarian politics, grasping class struggle, and promoting the smashing of the bourgeois "self" and the establishment of the proletarian "public," but about learning from the people of Dazhai to build roads, build houses, and build new villages. Therefore, after the black roots of anti-Dazhai, Liu Shaoqi and his agents, were dug out, if their anti-Dazhai poison was not eliminated, the movement to learn from Dazhai could not be carried out. To eliminate the poison and clear the obstacles, the revolutionary committees at all levels in Xiyang County, on the one hand, mobilized the broad masses of commune members to expose the heinous crimes of a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party who opposed Dazhai, using their anti-Dazhai fallacies as negative teaching materials to carry out thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism; on the other hand, the county revolutionary committee printed a large number of materials on the spirit and experience of Dazhai, using all occasions and all propaganda tools to publicize the spirit of Dazhai, and organized poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres to visit Dazhai many times, hold on-site meetings, and set up study classes. Through criticism, elimination of poison, and positive publicity of the spirit of Dazhai, the broad masses of commune members further deeply realized that learning from Dazhai means first learning the spirit and the essence. In the past two years of learning from Dazhai, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Xiyang County concretized the spirit of Dazhai into the following five aspects for study: (1) Learning from the people of Dazhai to be forever loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, regarding the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought as their first need, working hard on the "use" aspect, smashing the bourgeois "self" and establishing the proletarian "public," achieving ideological revolutionization, farming for revolution, and laboring for revolution; (2) Learning from the people of Dazhai to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, firmly grasp the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, resolutely oppose capitalist evil winds, resolutely resist bourgeois ideological influences, resolutely criticize revisionist thoughts, resolutely strike at the sabotage activities of class enemies, resolutely struggle against the bourgeois reactionary line, consciously implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and bravely defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; (3) Learning from the people of Dazhai to be self-reliant, strive hard, rely on the masses, and create wealth through hard work, changing the sky and the earth with revolutionary spirit; (4) Learning from Comrade Chen Yonggui and other cadres of Dazhai to emphasize proletarian politics, firmly grasp political and ideological work, learning from them to be public-spirited, not seeking personal gain, wholeheartedly serving the revolution, completely and thoroughly for the people, not separating from labor, not separating from the masses, and striving hard; (5) Learning from the people of Dazhai to be selfless, help others, have a national perspective, consider the overall situation, stand on Tiger Head Mountain, and look at the world.

Third, learning from Dazhai must launch a thought revolution to smash the bourgeois "self" and establish the proletarian "public." The growth process of Dazhai is a history of using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to transform people's worldview, smashing the "self," establishing the "public," and fiercely criticizing "revisionism." Comrade Chen Yonggui said: "Dazhai is a change that promotes three changes, that is, as thoughts change, land, technology, and output all change." "When people's thoughts change, any miracle in the world can be created." Therefore, to learn well from Dazhai, one must, like the people of Dazhai, smash the bourgeois "self," establish the proletarian "public," and achieve ideological revolutionization. The revolutionary committee of Xiyang County, with "fighting the self and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline, firmly grasped the thought revolution of the broad masses of commune members to smash the bourgeois "self" and establish the proletarian "public," guiding the commune members to take the people of Dazhai as their example, daring to expose and fight their "self," sparking a revolution in their souls, achieving ideological revolutionization, thus changing people's spiritual appearance, promoting the movement to learn from Dazhai, and promoting the great development of agricultural production and the construction of new rural areas.

Fourth, the key to learning well from Dazhai is to firmly grasp the construction of the leading cadre team, building it into a command center that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, proletarianized, revolutionized, and militarized. Chairman Mao taught us: "After the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor." The cadres of Dazhai, through many years of practical struggle, deeply felt: "A village looks at its cadres, a household looks at its cadres, and the commune members look at the cadres." "To forge iron, one must first harden oneself; to make a revolution, one must first revolutionize oneself." To truly master the spirit of Dazhai, cadres must first become Dazhai-style cadres. The revolutionary committee of Xiyang County, in leading the masses to carry out the movement to learn from Dazhai, paid great attention to the revolutionization of the grassroots leading cadre teams in rural areas. They required all grassroots cadres in rural areas to, like Comrade Chen Yonggui and other cadres of Dazhai, not separate from the masses, firmly grasp class struggle, firmly grasp political and ideological work, set an example, take the lead in participating in production labor, and always maintain the character of the working people. For this purpose, the county revolutionary committee, taking the commune as a unit, held study classes on Mao Zedong Thought to learn from Dazhai in Dazhai, actively training cadres and backbone members of communes, production brigades, and production teams. The county has trained a total of 19 batches, more than 2,000 people, greatly enhancing the combat effectiveness of the leading cadre teams. Most of these people have become strong backbones leading and inspiring the masses to learn from Dazhai.

Recently, the revolutionary committee of Xiyang County summarized the movement to learn from Dazhai across the county. They decided to better lead the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres, and commune members to hold higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, push the mass movement of "Agriculture Learns from Dazhai" to a new high, welcome the new leap in agricultural production and construction, and strive to build Xiyang County into a red Dazhai County of Mao Zedong Thought as soon as possible.

    坚决贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席“农业学大寨”的光辉指示
    昔阳县开展学大寨运动取得重大成绩和丰富经验
    全县所有的生产大队都推广了大寨大队突出无产阶级政治的劳动管理制度，去年粮食总产量是历史上最高的一年，今年农业生产在遭受旱、虫、雹等多种灾害的情况下又获大丰收
     据新华社太原二十日电　在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，山西省昔阳县革命委员会高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“农业学大寨”的光辉指示，狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其代理人的革命大批判，在全县范围内开展走大寨路，学大寨人，立大寨志，兴大寨风的学大寨的群众运动，取得了很大的成绩和丰富的经验。
    昔阳县革委会在去年二月成立以后，很快领导全县革命人民展开了学大寨的群众运动。全县广大贫下中农和社员群众以大寨人为榜样，把活学活用毛泽东思想放在高于一切，大于一切，先于一切，重于一切的地位，在斗争中学，在斗争中用，阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟空前提高。他们大破资产阶级“私”字，大立无产阶级“公”字，树立为革命种田的思想，一心一意为革命的大寨式的社会主义新型农民成千上万地涌现出来。由于广大社员群众树立了为革命种田的思想，全县四百一十五个大队全部推广了大寨大队突出无产阶级政治、一心为公劳动的劳动管理制度，从而在农村经营管理上实现了一场深刻的社会主义大革命。广大农村基层干部在学大寨运动中以陈永贵同志为榜样，不怕艰苦，不怕困难，敢于革命，敢于斗争，全心全意为贫下中农服务。全县的农业生产在近两年的学大寨运动中有了迅速的发展。去年粮食总产量比一九六六年增长百分之四十三，是历史上产量最高的一年，同时超额百分之七点四完成了国家征购任务。今年全县遭受了旱、虫、雹、风、洪水等自然灾害，由于广大革命群众发扬大寨人战天斗地的革命精神，终于战胜了自然灾害，使全县农业生产又获得了大丰收。
    无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的胜利，是学大寨群众运动蓬勃发展的根本前提。昔阳县革命委员会成立后，立即作出了在全县开展学大寨群众运动的决定。这个县的革命委员会认为，毛主席亲自树立起来的大寨红旗，是我国农村在无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的先进集体，是我国农村进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的光辉榜样。他们把领导学大寨运动当作革命委员会的重要任务，把学大寨当作农村无产阶级文化大革命斗、批、改的一个重要内容来抓，从而把学大寨和农村的斗、批、改紧密结合起来。他们的具体作法是：
    一、高举毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，深入持久地开展革命大批判，以革命大批判为动力，推动学大寨。毛主席教导我们说：“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。”刘少奇及其在昔阳县的代理人，在我国由于连续遭受三年严重自然灾害经济发生暂时困难时期，大肆推行反革命修正主义黑货，妄图把昔阳县变成他们复辟资本主义的一个基地，这是开展学大寨运动的最大障碍。昔阳县广大贫下中农以毛泽东思想为武器，以大寨为榜样，紧紧结合当地阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的实际，进行了回忆、对比、批判。他们先看毛主席是怎么说的，大寨人是怎样按照毛主席的教导办事的，自己那个生产队又是怎样做的；再看刘少奇是怎样放毒的，大寨人是怎样以毛泽东思想为武器进行抵制的，自己那个生产队是抵制还是中毒了？这样，一个时期一个时期的回忆本村本队过去的道路是怎么走过来的，和大寨比较、对照，差距在哪里，问题是什么，就清清楚楚。然后，他们再把找出来的问题，和刘少奇鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“工分挂帅”、“物质刺激”、“桃园经验”、“公私溶化论”等反革命修正主义谬论相对照，按照问题，摆事实，谈危害，顺藤摸瓜，号往走资派身上挂，苦往走资派身上诉，账往走资派身上算，根往走资派身上挖，矛头直指刘少奇及其在山西的代理人。这样的大批判，使广大社员看得见，摸得着，打得准，批得透，感受深刻，受教育大，越批越有劲。他们越批越恨刘少奇，越恨资产阶级反动路线；越爱伟大领袖毛主席，越爱毛主席的无产阶级革命路线；越批学大寨的信心越大，走大寨道路的劲头越足。
    二、肃清党内一小撮走资派歪曲、贬低和反对大寨的流毒，教育广大社员群众学大寨要学根本，学思想，学精神。学大寨学什么，怎么学，是一场尖锐的阶级斗争。他们采用树假典型的卑鄙手段压大寨，千方百计地歪曲、贬低和诬蔑大寨精神和大寨经验，企图搞垮大寨红旗。党内一小撮走资派对大寨精神和大寨经验的歪曲和诬蔑，在农村流毒很深。有一些地区学大寨不是学大寨人活学活用毛泽东思想，大力突出无产阶级政治，大抓阶级斗争，大搞破私立公，而是学大寨人修地、修房、盖新村庄。因此，在把反大寨的黑根子刘少奇及其代理人挖出来以后，如果不把他们反大寨的流毒肃清，学大寨的运动就开展不起来。为了肃清流毒，扫清障碍，昔阳县各级革委会一方面发动广大社员群众揭露党内一小撮走资派反对大寨的滔天罪行，把他们反大寨的谬论作为反面教材，开展深入持久的革命大批判；另一方面，县革命委员会又大量印发大寨精神和大寨经验的材料，利用一切场合和一切宣传工具，宣传大寨精神，并且多次组织贫下中农和革命干部到大寨参观，开现场会，办学习班。通过大批判、肃流毒和正面宣传大寨精神，广大社员群众进一步深刻地认识到，学大寨要首先学精神，学根本。在近二年的学大寨运动中，昔阳县广大贫下中农把大寨精神具体化为以下五个方面去学习：（1）学习大寨人永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，把活学活用毛泽东思想当作自己的第一需要，在“用”字上狠下功夫，大破资产阶级“私”字，大立无产阶级“公”字，实现思想革命化，为革命种田，为革命劳动；（2）学习大寨人以毛泽东思想为武器，狠抓两个阶级、两条道路和两条路线的斗争，对于资本主义的歪风邪气坚决反对，对于资产阶级的思想影响坚决抵制，对于修正主义思想坚决批判，对于阶级敌人的破坏活动坚决打击，对于资产阶级反动路线坚决斗争，自觉地执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，勇敢地捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线；（3）学习大寨人自力更生，艰苦奋斗，依靠群众，勤俭创业，改天换地的革命精神；（4）学习陈永贵和大寨其他干部突出无产阶级政治，狠抓政治思想工作，学习他们一心为公，不谋私利，全心全意为革命，完全彻底为人民，不脱离劳动，不脱离群众，艰苦奋斗的革命精神；（5）学习大寨人大公无私，助人为乐，以国为怀，顾全大局，站在虎头山，放眼全世界的共产主义精神。
    三、学大寨，必须开展一场破私立公的思想大革命。大寨的成长过程，就是以毛泽东思想为武器，改造人的世界观，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，猛批“修”字的历史。陈永贵同志说：“大寨是一变促三变，就是随着思想变，土地、技术、产量都在变。”“人的思想变了，什么人间奇迹都可以创造出来。”因此，要学好大寨就必须象大寨人那样，大破资产阶级“私”字，大立无产阶级“公”字，实现思想革命化。昔阳县革命委员会以“斗私，批修”为纲，狠抓广大社员群众的破私立公，引导社员以大寨人为榜样敢于亮私斗私，在灵魂深处爆发革命，实现思想革命化，从而改变了人们的精神面貌，推动了学大寨运动，促进了农业生产和新农村建设的大发展。
    四、学好大寨的关键，是狠抓领导班子的建设，把它建设成为一个高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的无产阶级化、革命化、战斗化的指挥部。毛主席教导我们说：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”大寨的干部在多年的实践斗争中深深体会到：“村看村，户看户，社员看的是干部。”“打铁先得本身硬，革命先革自己命。”要把大寨精神真正学到手，干部首先要成为大寨式的干部。昔阳县革命委员会在领导群众开展学大寨的运动中，非常重视农村基层领导班子的革命化建设。他们要求所有农村基层干部都要象陈永贵和大寨其他干部那样不脱离群众，狠抓阶级斗争，狠抓政治思想工作，以身作则，带头参加生产劳动，始终保持劳动人民的本色。为此，县革命委员会以公社为单位，在大寨举办学大寨毛泽东思想学习班，积极培训公社、生产大队、生产队干部和贫下中农骨干分子。全县先后培训十九批，共二千多人，大大增强了领导班子的战斗力，这些人绝大部分成了领导和带动群众学大寨的坚强骨干。
    最近，昔阳县革命委员会对全县的学大寨运动进行了总结。他们决心更好地带领广大贫下中农、革命干部和社员群众，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把“农业学大寨”的群众运动推向新的高潮，迎接农业生产建设的新跃进，为早日把昔阳县建设成为红彤彤的毛泽东思想大寨县而奋斗。
