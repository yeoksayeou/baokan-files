Autumn harvest and planting work is being hurriedly carried out in the countryside throughout Albania.

By October 26, 43 percent of the wheat planting area had been completed. In the Dibra region, wheat planting has been fully completed.

So far, 57 percent of the corn harvest work has been completed nationwide. The harvest of other late autumn crops is also being carried out intensively.

According to another report from the Albanian News Agency, in the Durres region, reclamation workers are reclaiming and draining land in the Rrushkul Plain, turning 2,500 hectares of land into fertile fields.

In recent years, state farms and agricultural cooperatives in Albania have increased the production of poultry, meat, and eggs to meet the needs of the people. In 1967, compared to 1965, the number of poultry in state farms increased by more than 62 percent, and in agricultural cooperatives by 16 percent. This year, the number of poultry nationwide is expected to increase by 40 percent compared to 1967.

To develop poultry production, the Albanian government has established chicken hatcheries in some regions, resulting in increased production of poultry meat and egg products.
