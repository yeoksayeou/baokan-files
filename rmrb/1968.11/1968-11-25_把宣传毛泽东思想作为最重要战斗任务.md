The revolutionary workers of the Chongli County New China Bookstore in Hebei Province have established the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly and made propagating Mao Zedong Thought the most important battle task. They have become a red vanguard active in the mountainous areas.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers of the Chongli County New China Bookstore severely criticized the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi and his local agents for their heinous crimes of obstructing the distribution of Chairman Mao's works and opposing the service of books to workers, peasants, and soldiers. They allowed Mao Zedong Thought to occupy the book distribution front. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Old Three Articles" and "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," establishing the idea of serving the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the mountainous areas. The eight revolutionary workers of this bookstore, except for one who stays to guard the store, all go to the vast rural areas of the mountains to distribute books. With boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, to meet the urgent needs of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses in the mountainous areas, they carry revolutionary treasures, traverse mountains and rivers, and cover all 15 communes, over 200 production brigades, and all factory and military station locations in the county. In two years, they distributed over 90,000 copies of Chairman Mao's works (the total population of the county is 90,000), 110,000 portraits of Chairman Mao, and 62,000 copies of Chairman Mao's quotations, meeting the demands of the masses. Because they actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, they have become an advanced collective in studying Chairman Mao's works in the Zhangjiakou area.

Recently, with the help of the military's support-left team, the revolutionary workers of the Chongli County New China Bookstore seriously studied Chairman Mao's works, summarized the experiences of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers over the past two years, and further carried out revolutionary criticism. They studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "The Red Army's fighting is not merely for fighting but to propagate among the masses, organize the masses, arm the masses, and help the masses build revolutionary political power. Without these goals, fighting loses its meaning, and the Red Army loses its significance." They also studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation thoroughly," severely criticizing Liu Shaoqi and his local agents for promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist goods of "profit-first" and "business-first." They realized that although they had achieved the goal of going to the mountains and countryside to deliver revolutionary treasures, the single-minded business viewpoint had not been completely overcome, and Mao Zedong Thought had not been well propagated to the masses. Therefore, they further proposed new requirements: to deliver revolutionary treasures to the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants and help them master Mao Zedong Thought, and to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin in the hearts of poor and lower-middle peasants. From then on, they further broke away from the single-minded business viewpoint, acting as both distributors of Chairman Mao's works and propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought.

When the bookstore's revolutionary workers go to the countryside to distribute Chairman Mao's works, they eat, live, work, study, and criticize and transform with the poor and lower-middle peasants. They help production teams set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. When they go to remote mountainous villages to distribute books, they see that there are few literate people, so they help establish Mao Zedong Thought study guidance groups and repeatedly read Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the poor and lower-middle peasants. When they go to backward teams, they propagate the advanced teams' experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works and help improve work. They also bring barber tools to give the poor and lower-middle peasants haircuts.

The revolutionary workers of the Chongli County New China Bookstore climb high mountains and enter deep valleys to deliver revolutionary treasures to the poor and lower-middle peasants, enthusiastically propagating Mao Zedong Thought, and have received enthusiastic praise from the poor and lower-middle peasants: "You thought of what we were thinking and did what we urgently wanted to do. You are truly Chairman Mao's good workers, the intimate friends of us poor and lower-middle peasants!"

    把宣传毛泽东思想作为最重要战斗任务
    崇礼县新华书店革命职工，既当毛主席著作的发行员，又当毛泽东思想的宣传员，成为活跃在山区的一支红色尖兵
    新华社石家庄二十四日电　位于河北省山区的崇礼县新华书店的革命职工，树立全心全意为人民服务的思想，把宣传毛泽东思想作为最重要的战斗任务，成为活跃在山区的一支红色尖兵。在无产阶级文化大革命中，崇礼县新华书店的革命职工，狠批了叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其在当地代理人阻挠发行毛主席著作、反对图书发行为工农兵服务的滔天罪行，让毛泽东思想占领了图书发行阵地。他们反复学习了毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”和《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，树立了为山区广大贫下中农服务的思想。这个书店八名革命职工，除留一人在书店值班外，其余都到山区广大农村做发行图书工作。他们怀着无限忠于毛主席的赤胆忠心，为了满足山区广大贫下中农和革命群众的迫切需要，身背革命宝书，跋山涉水，走遍了全县十五个公社、二百多个大队和所有的工厂、部队驻地。他们两年来发行毛主席著作九万多册（全县总人口九万人），毛主席画像十一万多张，毛主席语录六万二千多张，满足了广大群众的要求。由于他们活学活用毛主席著作好，成为张家口地区学习毛主席著作的先进集体。
    最近，崇礼县新华书店革命职工在解放军支左部队的帮助下，认真学习毛主席著作，总结了两年多来为工农兵服务的经验，并且进一步开展革命的大批判。他们学习了毛主席的教导：“红军的打仗，不是单纯地为了打仗而打仗，而是为了宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众，并帮助群众建设革命政权才去打仗的，离了对群众的宣传、组织、武装和建设革命政权等项目标，就是失去了打仗的意义，也就是失去了红军存在的意义。”同时学习了毛主席“认真搞好斗、批、改”的最新指示，狠批了刘少奇及其在本县代理人推行的“利润挂帅”“业务第一”等反革命修正主义黑货。他们认识到：以前虽然做到了坚持上山下乡送革命宝书，但是单纯业务观点还没有完全克服，还没有做到很好地向广大群众宣传毛泽东思想。于是，他们进一步提出了新的要求：把革命宝书送到贫下中农家里，同时，帮助贫下中农把毛泽东思想学到手，把毛主席的最新指示和以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令落实到贫下中农的心坎上。从此，他们就进一步破除了单纯业务观点，既当毛主席著作的发行员，又当毛泽东思想的宣传员。
    书店革命职工下乡发行毛主席著作时，就和贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同斗私批修，帮助生产队办毛泽东思想学习班，落实毛主席的最新指示。他们到偏僻山村发行时，看到那里识字的人少，就帮助建立起学习毛主席著作辅导组，给贫下中农反复宣读毛主席最新指示。到了后进队，他们就宣传先进队学习毛主席著作的经验，帮助改进工作。他们还带着理发用具，给贫下中农理发。
    崇礼县新华书店革命职工们爬高山、进深沟，给贫下中农送革命宝书，满腔热情地宣传毛泽东思想，受到了贫下中农的热烈赞扬：“你们想了我们心里所想的，做了我们急着要做的。你们真是毛主席的好职工，是咱贫下中农的贴心人！”
