Xinhua News Agency, November 23rd: Albanian Ambassador to China Natanaeli held a reception in Beijing today to celebrate the 19th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Albania and China.

Vice Premier Xie Fuzhi, officials from relevant government departments, the People's Liberation Army, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, and other relevant officials such as Ji Pengfei were invited to attend the reception.

Ambassador Natanaeli and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei both spoke at the reception.

Ambassador Natanaeli praised the fraternal and friendly cooperative relationship between Albania and China over the past 19 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations. He said, "In the 19 years since our two countries have been victorious in building socialism, the combative friendship, the close and comprehensive cooperation, and the great unity between the peoples of Albania and China have developed and strengthened, setting a brilliant example for the revolutionary peoples of the world. The unity of thought and action between the Marxist-Leninist parties of our two countries and the glorious peoples, as well as their unyielding struggle against imperialism led by the United States and against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist clique, is a historic victory for the great principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism."

Ambassador Natanaeli said, "The 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, chaired by Comrade Mao Zedong, is of great historical significance for the destiny of the Chinese people, for the world revolution, and for the socialist cause. It is a thorough victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao over the bourgeois reactionary line of the traitor Liu Shaoqi and his agents within the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people."

Vice Minister Ji Pengfei said in his speech, "The friendship between China and Albania was personally initiated and cultivated by the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha. This friendship is the most precious and greatest. Over the past 19 years, in the great cause of opposing imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism led by the Soviet revisionist clique, and reactionaries in various countries, our two parties and peoples have consistently supported and inspired each other, fighting side by side. The Chinese people always feel the fraternal support and help from the Albanian people. The Albanian Labor Party, led by the great Marxist-Leninist Enver Hoxha, and the Albanian people have highly valued and firmly supported our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution from the very beginning. Recently, the public report issued by the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of our Party was the first to receive enthusiastic praise from the Albanian Labor Party."

Vice Minister Ji Pengfei said, "Under the wise leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the heroic Albanian people have raised the banner of Marxism-Leninism high, carried out a magnificent revolutionization movement, promoted the revolutionization of people's thoughts, prevented the restoration of capitalism, consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat; you rely on your own efforts, strive for self-improvement, and insist on the socialist path; you adhere to principles, fear no might, and dare to fight against imperialism led by U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism led by the Soviet revisionist clique in a resolute and unyielding struggle. The brotherly Albanian people have won the admiration of the revolutionary peoples of the world with their heroic struggle and brilliant achievements. The Chinese people are proud to have such close comrades-in-arms."

    纳塔奈利大使和我外交部副部长姬鹏飞在招待会上讲了话。
    纳塔奈利大使赞扬阿中两国建交十九周年来在各方面的兄弟般的友好合作关系。他说，在我们两国胜利进行社会主义建设的十九年来，阿中两国人民之间的战斗友谊、兄弟般的亲密的全面合作、钢铁般的伟大团结，得到了发展和加强，并为世界革命人民树立了光辉的榜样。我们两国马克思列宁主义的党、两国光荣的人民之间的这种友谊及其思想行动的十分一致，以及他们为反对以美国为首的帝国主义和反对以苏联叛徒集团为中心的修正主义而进行的坚持不懈的斗争，是马克思列宁主义学说和无产阶级国际主义伟大原则的具有历史意义的胜利。
    纳塔奈利大使说，由毛泽东同志亲自主持召开的中国共产党第八届扩大的十二中全会，对中国人民的命运，对世界革命和社会主义事业来说，是一件具有伟大历史意义的事情，是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，对中国共产党和中国人民的叛徒刘少奇及其代理人的资产阶级反动路线的彻底胜利。
    姬鹏飞副部长在讲话中说，中阿友谊是由中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席和阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志亲自缔造和培育起来的，这种友谊是最珍贵、最伟大的。十九年来，在反对以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏修叛徒集团为首的现代修正主义和各国反动派的伟大事业中，我们两党和两国人民一贯互相支持，互相鼓舞，并肩战斗。中国人民无时不感到阿尔巴尼亚人民所给予的兄弟般的支持和帮助。以伟大的马克思列宁主义者恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民，从一开始就高度评价和坚决支持我国的无产阶级文化大革命。最近，我们党召开的第八届扩大的十二中全会和全会发表的公报，又最先得到阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的热情赞扬。
    姬鹏飞副部长说，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在恩维尔·霍查同志的英明领导下，高举马克思列宁主义大旗，开展轰轰烈烈的革命化运动，促进人的思想革命化，防止资本主义复辟，巩固无产阶级专政；你们自力更生，奋发图强，坚持走社会主义道路；你们坚持原则，不畏强暴，敢于同以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义和以苏修叛徒集团为首的现代修正主义进行针锋相对和不屈不挠的斗争。兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民以自己的英勇斗争和光辉成就，赢得了全世界革命人民的敬佩。中国人民以有你们这样的亲密战友而感到自豪。
