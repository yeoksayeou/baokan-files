The 330,000 people of Ping Mountain County listened to the communiqué of the 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Party on the radio and immediately burst into excitement. Everyone held a red copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," raised portraits of Chairman Mao, beat drums and gongs, and rushed onto the streets, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" a thousand times, ten thousand times.

Ping Mountain County's Xibaipo was the location of the Party Central Committee during the War of Liberation and the place where our great leader Chairman Mao once lived. Nineteen years ago, Chairman Mao personally presided over the historic 2nd Plenary Session of the 7th Central Committee here, issuing a series of important directives that guided the people of the entire country to thoroughly bury the Chiang Kai-shek regime. Nineteen years later, today, amidst the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution heading towards all-around victory and the excellent situation both internationally and domestically, our great leader Chairman Mao once again personally presided over the historic 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee. The session deeply summarized the great achievements and experiences of the Cultural Revolution over the past two years, announcing the expulsion of the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever, and the revocation of all his positions within and outside the Party. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The convening of this session will surely accelerate the all-around victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country.

"To sail the seas depends on the helmsman, to carry out revolution depends on Mao Zedong Thought." The revolutionary people of Ping Mountain County, who have received Chairman Mao's personal instructions, deeply feel from their struggle practice that following Chairman Mao means victory. Twenty years ago, under Chairman Mao's leadership, the people of the entire county had waged a tenacious struggle against Liu Shaoqi. During the land reform, out of his counter-revolutionary needs, Liu Shaoqi promoted the "moving stones" campaign, striking at the poor and lower-middle peasants, attempting to strangle the surging land reform movement. At this critical moment, it was Chairman Mao who corrected the revolutionary course. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants smashed Liu Shaoqi's evil plots and achieved victory in the revolution. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary masses of our county have maintained and carried forward the revolutionary tradition, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, launching a fierce attack on a handful of capitalist-roaders within the old county committee, breaking through the numerous obstacles of Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois reactionary line, exposing Liu Shaoqi's agents in our county, and achieving decisive victories. In May last year, the Ping Mountain County Revolutionary Committee was established, firmly grasping the reins of power in the hands of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat.

The newly born revolutionary power, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, responds to every new directive from Chairman Mao and every battle command from the proletarian headquarters with swift action and earnest implementation. This year, following the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, we have streamlined the organization, with 86% of the cadres sent down to labor, reformed unreasonable regulations, and held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Mao Zedong Thought has been widely popularized, and the people of the entire county are all concerned about national affairs. The flames of the revolutionary criticism are burning more fiercely, and the poison of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line is being further purged.

The 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee, presided over by Chairman Mao, is like a lighthouse with rays of light, illuminating our path forward. The glorious and arduous task before us is to carry forward the spirit of thorough proletarian revolution, closely unite around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, march forward to victory along the path indicated by the plenary session, fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest directives, deeply carry out the revolutionary criticism, firmly grasp class struggle, do a good job in purging the class ranks, and according to Chairman Mao's directive of "discarding the old and taking in the new," do a good job in rectifying and building the Party, carrying out the educational revolution, speed up our steps, and seize the all-around victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    沿着全会指引的方向胜利前进
    河北省平山县革委会副主任　曾从
    我们平山县三十三万人民从广播里听到党的八届十二中全会公报后，顿时沸腾起来，人人手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高举毛主席画像，敲锣打鼓，纷纷拥上街头，一千遍一万遍地欢呼：毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    平山县西柏坡在解放战争期间曾经是党中央所在地，是我们伟大领袖毛主席居住过的地方。十九年前，毛主席曾经在这里亲自主持召开了具有伟大历史意义的党的七届二中全会。毛主席在这次会议上作了一系列重要指示，引导全国人民彻底埋葬了蒋家王朝。十九年后的今天，在无产阶级文化大革命走向全面胜利的凯歌声中，在国际国内一片大好形势下，我们伟大领袖毛主席又亲自主持召开了具有伟大历史意义的党的八届十二中全会，深刻地总结了两年来文化大革命的伟大成就和经验，宣布把隐藏在党内的叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外一切职务，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，这是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利。这次会议的召开，必将加速我国无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的步伐。
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”受过毛主席亲自教诲的平山县革命人民，从斗争实践中深深体会到，紧跟毛主席就是胜利。早在二十年前，全县人民在毛主席领导下，就曾经和刘少奇作过顽强的斗争。土地改革时，刘少奇出于他反革命的需要，大搞什么“搬石头”，打击贫下中农，妄图扼杀轰轰烈烈的土地改革运动。在这关键时刻，是毛主席拨正了革命航向，广大贫下中农在毛主席革命路线的指引下，粉碎了刘少奇的罪恶阴谋，使革命取得了胜利。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我县广大革命群众，保持和发扬革命传统，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，向旧县委内一小撮走资派发起了猛烈的进攻，冲破了刘少奇的资产阶级反动路线的重重障碍，揪出了刘少奇在我县的代理人，取得了决定性的胜利。去年五月成立了平山县革命委员会，把印把子重新牢牢掌握在无产阶级革命派手里。
    新生的革命政权，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，对毛主席的每个最新指示，对无产阶级司令部发出的每一个战斗号令，都是闻风而动，认真贯彻。今年以来，我们遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，精简了机构，百分之八十六的干部下放劳动，改革了不合理的规章制度，举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，毛泽东思想空前大普及，全县人民人人关心国家大事，革命大批判的烈火越烧越旺，刘少奇散布的反革命修正主义路线的流毒，正在进一步肃清。
    毛主席亲自主持召开的八届十二中全会，象光芒万丈的灯塔，照亮了我们前进的道路。当前摆在我们面前的任务是光荣而艰巨的，我们一定要发扬无产阶级彻底革命的精神，紧紧团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，沿着全会指引的方向胜利前进，全面落实毛主席一系列最新指示，深入开展革命大批判，狠抓阶级斗争，搞好清理阶级队伍的工作，按照毛主席“吐故纳新”的指示，搞好整党建党，搞好教育革命，加快步伐，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
