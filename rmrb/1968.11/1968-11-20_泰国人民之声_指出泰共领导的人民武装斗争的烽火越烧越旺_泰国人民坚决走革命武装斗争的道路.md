"The Voice of the Thai People" radio station broadcasted an article on the 18th, stating that the Thai people can only achieve revolutionary victory and complete liberation under the leadership of the Thai Communist Party by resolutely taking the path of revolutionary armed struggle.

The article said, the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao Zedong, teaches us: "The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally applicable, whether in China or abroad, it is universally correct." The article said, the Thai Communist Party, which adheres to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, has summarized the experiences and lessons learned from the Thai people's arduous struggles with their blood: the Thai revolution can only seize power through armed struggle.

The article said, the Thai Communist Party has led the Thai people in revolutionary armed struggle for more than three years. The revolutionary practice of the past three years has fully proven that the path of armed struggle is the only correct way to liberate the country and the people. At present, the flames of people's war have spread to thirty-one provinces. The people's armed forces are growing stronger with each battle and have become an invincible force that no enemy can defeat. The Thai people's armed struggle has a bright future, and it is the hope of the Thai people to drive out the American imperialists and overthrow the Thanon-Phap selling-out regime. More and more Thai people are participating in and supporting the people's armed struggle. The revolutionary people of the world, especially the 700 million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, stand on our side and firmly support us.

The article pointed out that the rapid development and growth of the Thai people's revolutionary armed struggle has seriously shaken the reactionary rule of the U.S.-Thanom group. Although the U.S.-Thai reactionaries are carrying out large-scale military suppression, they cannot stop the victorious development of the Thai people's armed struggle. Therefore, they are playing political tricks, issuing a false constitution, and preparing to hold false elections, attempting to deceive the people into abandoning armed struggle and engaging in so-called "peaceful struggle" and "parliamentary struggle," thereby prolonging the life of their reactionary rule. However, the despicable political conspiracy of the U.S.-Thanom group will not succeed.

The article said, the spokesperson of the Thai Communist Party timely exposed the enemy's political deception plot to the people, emphasizing that armed struggle is the only way for the Thai people to expel American imperialism, overthrow the Thanon-Bap selling-out regime, and strive for true national independence and democracy. The article called on the Thai people to resolutely wage people's war and smash the political trickery of the U.S.-Thanom group.

The article said, the selling-out, fascist dictatorship, and reactionary nature of the Thanon-Bap group, which harms the country and the people, not only has not changed at all but has become even more rampant. The broad masses of the Thai people have seen through the reactionary face of the U.S.-Thanom group and are rising up to fight them resolutely. The Thai people are united around the Thai Communist Party and resolutely advance along the path of armed struggle indicated by the Thai Communist Party. The article finally emphasized that in such a good revolutionary situation, as long as the Thai people unite more closely, follow the Thai Communist Party, and resolutely carry out the armed struggle to the end, victory will definitely belong to the Thai people.

　　“泰国人民之声”指出泰共领导的人民武装斗争的烽火越烧越旺
　　泰国人民坚决走革命武装斗争的道路
    据新华社十九日讯　“泰国人民之声”电台十八日广播一篇文章指出，泰国人民只有在泰国共产党领导下，坚决走革命武装斗争的道路，才能取得革命的胜利，获得彻底的解放。
    文章说，世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席教导我们：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的，不论在中国在外国，一概都是对的。”文章说，坚持马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的泰国共产党，总结了泰国人民经过顽强斗争用鲜血换来的经验教训：泰国的革命只有用人民武装斗争的方式去夺取政权。
    文章说，泰国共产党领导泰国人民进行革命武装斗争已经三年多了。三年来的革命实践充分证明，武装斗争道路是解放国家和人民的唯一正确道路。目前，人民战争的烽火已经蔓延到三十一个府的广大地区。人民武装越战越强，已经成为任何敌人不可战胜的强大力量。泰国人民武装斗争有着光明的前途，这是泰国人民赶走美帝、推翻他侬—巴博卖国集团的希望。参加和支持人民武装斗争的泰国人民日益广泛，世界革命人民，特别是用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民站在我们一边，坚决支持我们。
    文章指出，泰国人民革命武装斗争的迅速发展壮大，严重地动摇了美国—他侬集团的反动统治。尽管美泰反动派进行大规模的武力镇压，但它们无法阻挡泰国人民武装斗争的胜利发展。因此，它们又玩弄政治大骗局，颁布伪宪法，准备举行伪选举，妄图诱惑人民放弃武装斗争，去进行什么“和平斗争”和“议会斗争”，从而延长它们的反动统治的寿命。但是，美国—他侬集团卑鄙的政治阴谋是不能得逞的。
    文章说，泰国共产党发言人及时地向人民揭露了敌人的政治欺骗阴谋，强调指出，武装斗争才是泰国人民驱逐美帝国主义、推翻他侬—巴博卖国集团和争取国家真正独立民主的唯一出路，并且号召泰国人民坚决进行人民战争，粉碎美帝—他侬集团的政治大骗局。
    文章说，他侬—巴博集团的卖国、法西斯专制，祸国殃民的反动本质不但丝毫没有改变，而且日益变本加厉。广大泰国人民看清了美国—他侬集团的反动面目，纷纷起来同它们进行坚决的斗争。泰国人民团结在泰国共产党周围，坚决沿着泰国共产党指出的武装斗争道路前进。文章最后强调指出，在这样大好的革命形势下，只要泰国人民更加紧密地团结起来，紧跟泰国共产党，坚决把武装斗争进行到底，胜利就一定属于泰国人民。
