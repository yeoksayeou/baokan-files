After the letters from comrades Hóu Zhènmín and Wáng Qìngyú were published, they sparked a significant reaction in our school. Most students firmly support the revolutionary suggestions made by comrades Hóu Zhènmín and Wáng Qìngyú. However, a small number of students emphasize that "teachers earn work points, and rural incomes are low"; some say that public primary schools being transferred to the production brigades for management "increases the burden on the poor and lower-middle peasants," and that "the poor and lower-middle peasants cannot afford it," and so on. We believe that these students' approach to looking at problems is incorrect. They do not first consider how to implement Chairman Mao's latest directive of "the poor and lower-middle peasants managing the schools," but rather first consider the issue of their own future salaries. This is entirely due to the "self" factor, and it is also a manifestation of being poisoned by the traitor Liu Shaoqi's "study to become an official" ideology.

After public primary schools are transferred to the production brigades for management, can the poor and lower-middle peasants afford the teachers' work points? We suggest discussing this in the newspapers, allowing the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, rural cadres, and primary school teachers to talk about it, to see what the actual situation is and how to handle the issue of changing salaries to work points.

    贫下中农真正负担不起教师的工分吗？
    侯振民、王庆余两同志的信发表后，在我校引起很大的反应。大多数同学，坚决支持侯振民、王庆余两同志的革命建议，但也有少部分同学强调“教师挣工分，农村收入低”；有的说公办小学下放大队来办，“增加了贫下中农负担”、“贫下中农负担不起”等等。我们认为这些同学看问题的方法不对，他们不是首先考虑怎样落实毛主席“贫下中农管理学校”的最新指示的问题，而是首先考虑将来自己的工资问题。这全是私字作怪，也是中了叛徒刘少奇“读书做官论”流毒的表现。
    公办小学下放到大队来办以后，教师的工分贫下中农是否负担得起？我们建议在报纸上讨论一下，让广大贫下中农、农村干部、小学教师都来谈谈，看看实际情况究竟是不是这样，以及应当怎样处理工资改工分的问题。辽宁省朝阳专区师范学校学生  于桂芝  李玉枝
