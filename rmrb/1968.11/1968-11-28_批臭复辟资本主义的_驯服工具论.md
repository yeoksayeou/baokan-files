The great leader Chairman Mao personally presided over and approved the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, which expressed the wishes of we poor and lower-middle peasants. The plenary session decided to expel the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi from the Party. We are truly overjoyed. We shout: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years of long life to Chairman Mao!

Liu Shaoqi, the number one capitalist-roader within the Party, madly opposed our great leader Chairman Mao, opposed the great Mao Zedong Thought, and opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. His crimes are heinous, and we must thoroughly settle his accounts for his counter-revolutionary crimes.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us that communists must have a thorough revolutionary spirit. However, Liu Shaoqi concocted a "Tame Tool Theory" to deceive us, preventing us from making a revolution and opposing the class enemy. His fallacies are aimed at opposing Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, suppressing revolutionary masses, and causing deep harm. We must thoroughly criticize and denounce them.

Liu Shaoqi viciously "admonished" Party members: "If not a tool, then what?" "Is it good to be a tame tool? Very good." How does one become a "tame tool"? According to him, "even if it's wrong, one must obey," and one must "unconditionally and absolutely obey." He also wants Party members to "firmly grasp this organizational principle." These words are all genuine counter-revolutionary jargon.

Liu Shaoqi wants us communists to be "tame tools," meaning he wants us to move as he, the counter-revolutionary, manipulates us. Can we do that? No! Chairman Mao teaches us: "Communists must question everything, think it over carefully, and see if it conforms to reality and has real logic. One must never blindly follow and never advocate slavishness." We must resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's teachings, and be revolutionary fighters of the proletariat, never becoming slaves manipulated by counter-revolutionaries and capitalist-roaders.

Liu Shaoqi rants about "even if it's wrong, one must obey." Where in the world is there such logic? Farming requires looking at whether the rows are straight, and listening requires seeing if it is reasonable. Chairman Mao often teaches us: harmful revolutionary leadership should not be unconditionally accepted but should be firmly resisted. Whether the leadership is right or wrong depends on whether it conforms to Mao Zedong Thought. Whatever conforms to Mao Zedong Thought is correct leadership, and we will resolutely support it; whatever goes against Mao Zedong Thought is wrong leadership, and we will resolutely resist it.

Liu Shaoqi shouts about "unconditional and absolute obedience," which means he doesn't want us to listen to Chairman Mao's words and follow Chairman Mao on the socialist path. He wants us to "unconditionally and absolutely" follow his counter-revolutionary revisionist line, leading us blindly into the capitalist dead end.

The "Tame Tool Theory" is not something new. In the old society, landlords and capitalists treated the poor as cattle and machines, wanting the laboring people to be "obedient subjects." Liu Shaoqi's "Tame Tool Theory" is in tune with the landlords and capitalists, picked up from them. Liu Shaoqi truly is a filial son and worthy grandson of landlords and capitalists.

False theories fear truth, and the masses have the sharpest eyes. Through years of struggle, I deeply feel that as long as we firmly grasp Mao Zedong Thought and rely closely on the broad poor and lower-middle peasants who are loyal to Chairman Mao, we can see through Liu Shaoqi's tricks to restore capitalism, not fall for his poison, not be deceived by him, and not be tricked by him.

In 1960, Liu Shaoqi and another major capitalist-roader blew the black wind of "three freedoms and one contract" to our place, and the county sent someone to force us to allocate more private plots. At that time, I thought: the account is clear, more private plots mean competing with collective land for labor and fertilizer, enriching individuals and weakening the collective. This is a struggle between two paths. At this time, I remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: agricultural collectivization is our "necessary path to go from poverty to prosperity," "only socialism can save China." Before liberation, our village had sixty-four households, twenty-eight begging households, forty-eight begging sticks, twenty-one laborers, and seventeen people who had no choice but to go to the Northeast. When the poor and lower-middle peasants heard that they were to be allocated more private plots, they were all furious. They said: "To allocate more private plots to us is to make us take the backward path. We cannot suffer twice. Whoever wants us to do this will not succeed. We will listen to Chairman Mao's words and walk the socialist path." We resisted this black wind.

In 1962, the old county committee again, according to Liu Shaoqi's line, sent people to demand that we divide the mountains, saying that "dividing them among the members is good for afforestation." This time we were not firm, and we divided some of them. In a few days, many trees in the mountains were cut down. The poor and lower-middle peasants saw this situation and criticized us severely: "What you did is wrong. Chairman Mao teaches us to walk the socialist path, but you are dismantling the socialist platform. Quickly take back the mountains." The opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants conform to Mao Zedong Thought, so we followed them and blocked this perverse wind again.

In the past, some people became "tame tools" of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line because they had too much selfishness, were afraid of being burned, were afraid of being scalded, did not distinguish right from wrong, and dared not uphold principles. To thoroughly eliminate the poison of the "Tame Tool Theory," we must fiercely fight selfishness and uproot its roots. Only in this way can we withstand storms and waves, bravely defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

We resolutely oppose the "Tame Tool Theory." However, we resolutely obey the leader of the proletariat, the command of the proletariat, and the great truth of the proletariat. We oppose the reactionary anarchist thought of "doubt everything." Chairman Mao is the great leader of the proletariat, the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is our highest command center, and Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding ideology for all work of the entire Party, the entire army, and the entire country. For every instruction from Chairman Mao and every battle command from the proletarian headquarters, we must follow step by step and implement it item by item. For the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, we must pass it down from generation to generation and act according to it forever. Whoever dares to oppose Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, we will resolutely fight them to the end.

We must use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to thoroughly eliminate the poison of Liu Shaoqi's "Tame Tool Theory," raise the awareness of the struggle between the two lines, carry forward the vigorous revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, and forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever march forward on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

    批臭复辟资本主义的“驯服工具论”
    山东省农业劳动模范　张富贵
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持通过的党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报，表达了俺贫下中农的心愿。全会决定，把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇这个反革命头子清除出党。我们真是高兴极了。我们高呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！
    刘少奇这个党内头号走资派，疯狂反对我们伟大领袖毛主席，反对伟大的毛泽东思想，反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，真是罪恶滔天，我们必须彻底清算他的反革命罪行。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们，共产党人要有彻底的革命精神。可是，刘少奇制造了一套“驯服工具论”，来蒙骗我们，不让我们革命，不让我们造阶级敌人的反。他这套谬论，是为了反对毛主席和毛泽东思想，镇压革命群众，毒人不轻，害人不浅，非批透、批臭不可。
    刘少奇恶狠狠地“教训”党员：“不做工具，做什么？”“作驯服的工具好不好？很好。”怎么才算“驯服工具”呢？照他的说法，“就是不对也要服从”，要“无条件的、绝对的服从”。他还要党员“拿稳这个组织原则”。这些话，都是地地道道的反革命黑话。
    刘少奇要我们共产党员做“驯服工具”，就是要我们听他这个反革命分子怎么拨弄就怎么动弹。我们能那样干吗？不能！毛主席教导我们：“共产党员对任何事情都要问一个为什么，都要经过自己头脑的周密思考，想一想它是否合乎实际，是否真有道理，绝对不应盲从，绝对不应提倡奴隶主义。”我们就是要坚决听毛主席的话，按照毛主席的教导，做无产阶级的革命战士，决不当任反革命分子和走资派摆弄的奴隶。
    刘少奇胡说什么“不对也要服从”，天下哪有这样的道理？种地要看顺垄不顺垄，听话要看顺理不顺理。毛主席经常教导我们：危害革命的错误领导，不应当无条件接受，而应当坚决抵制。看领导对和不对，就是看符合不符合毛泽东思想。凡是符合毛泽东思想的，就是正确的领导，我们就坚决拥护；凡是违背毛泽东思想的，就是错误的领导，我们就坚决抵制。
    刘少奇叫嚷什么“无条件的、绝对的服从”，就是不让咱听毛主席的话，跟着毛主席走社会主义道路，要咱“无条件的、绝对的”跟着他的反革命修正主义路线跑，迷迷糊糊地走进资本主义死胡同。
    “驯服工具论”并不是什么新玩艺。旧社会，地主、资本家就是把穷人当牛马，当机器，要劳动人民当“顺民”。刘少奇的“驯服工具论”，和地主、资本家那一套是一个调，是从他们那里拣来的。刘少奇真算是地主、资本家的孝子贤孙。
    谬论怕真理，群众眼最亮。经过多年的斗争，俺深深体会到，只要牢牢掌握住毛泽东思想，紧紧依靠无限忠于毛主席的广大贫下中农，就可以看穿刘少奇复辟资本主义的鬼计，不中他的毒，不受他的骗，不上他的当。
    一九六○年，刘少奇和另一个最大的走资派“三自一包”的黑风刮到俺那里，县里有人硬逼着俺多分自留地。当时俺想：一笔账明摆着，自留地多了，非得跟集体的地争工争粪不可，肥了个人，就瘦了集体。这是两条道路的斗争。这时俺想起毛主席的教导，农业集体化是我们“由穷苦变富裕的必由之路”，“只有社会主义能够救中国”。解放前，俺村六十四户，二十八户要饭的，四十八条要饭棍，二十一个扛活的，还有十七个人走投无路下了关东。贫下中农一听说要多分自留地，都气得不得了。他们说：“叫咱多分自留地，就是想叫咱走回头路。咱不能遭二茬罪。谁想叫咱这么搞都不行。咱就是听毛主席的话，社会主义道路走定了。”我们顶住了这股黑风。
    一九六二年，旧县委又按照刘少奇的一套，派人来要俺分山林，说什么“分给社员好造林”。这一回我们没有拿得稳，分了一部分。没几天，山林的树刨了不少。贫下中农看到这种情况，把我们好一顿批评：“你们这样做是错误的。毛主席教咱走社会主义道路，可你们偏拆社会主义的台，赶快把山林给收回来。”贫下中农的意见符合毛泽东思想，我们就照办了，又一次把这股歪风堵了回去。
    过去有些人当了刘少奇反革命修正主义路线的“驯服工具”，就是因为私心太重，怕烧着，怕烫着，不分是非，不敢坚持原则。要彻底肃清“驯服工具论”的流毒，就得狠斗私心，狠挖私根。只有这样，才能经得起大风大浪的考验，勇敢地捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    我们坚决反对“驯服工具论”。但是，我们坚决服从无产阶级的领袖、无产阶级的司令部和无产阶级的伟大真理。我们反对“怀疑一切”的反动的无政府主义思想。毛主席是无产阶级的伟大领袖，以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部是我们的最高战斗指挥部，毛泽东思想是全党、全军和全国一切工作的指导思想。对于毛主席的每一个指示、无产阶级司令部的每一项战斗号令，我们就是要步步紧跟，条条落实。对于战无不胜的毛泽东思想，我们就是要世世代代往下传，祖祖辈辈照着办。谁胆敢反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，我们就要誓死同他斗争到底。
    我们一定要用毛泽东思想作武器，彻底肃清刘少奇“驯服工具论”的流毒，提高两条路线斗争的觉悟，发扬生气勃勃的无产阶级革命精神，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线朝前走。
