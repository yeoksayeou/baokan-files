Approximately one thousand Australian citizens demonstrated outside the prison in the capital, Melbourne, on the 10th, demanding the release of a youth named Zapp. He was recently imprisoned by the Australian reactionary authorities for refusing to serve as a mercenary in South Vietnam.

The demonstrators outside the prison shouted slogans such as "Free Zapp, Imprison Gorton (Australian Prime Minister)" which frightened the Australian reactionary authorities into hastily dispatching a large number of police to guard the prison.

Due to an increasing number of Australian youths refusing to serve as mercenaries in South Vietnam for the Australian government, which follows the lead of U.S. imperialism, the reactionary authorities recently amended the "National Service Act." Zapp was arrested and imprisoned under this fascist decree. The Australian reactionary authorities, following the lead of U.S. imperialism, are committing crimes against the people by persecuting them, which is increasingly facing strong opposition from the Australian people.

Sydney News: Four thousand three hundred dock workers in Sydney went on a twenty-four-hour strike on the 6th to protest the management's unreasonable increase in labor intensity.

This strike caused chaos at the docks, with twenty million tons of cargo piled up.

　　要求释放被反动当局无理监禁的青年
　　澳一千群众在监狱外面示威
    新华社墨尔本十一日电　约一千名澳大利亚群众十日在首都墨尔本的监狱外举行示威，要求释放一名叫作扎布的青年，他是因为拒绝充当澳大利亚在越南南方的帮凶军而最近被澳大利亚反动当局监禁的。
    示威群众在监狱外高呼“释放扎布，监禁戈顿（澳大利亚总理）”的口号，吓得澳大利亚反动当局急急忙忙派出大批警察守卫在监狱周围。
    由于越来越多的澳大利亚青年拒绝充当澳大利亚派往越南南方的帮凶军，追随美帝国主义的澳大利亚反动当局，最近修订了“国家兵役法”。扎布就是澳大利亚反动当局根据这个法西斯法令拘捕监禁的。澳大利亚反动当局追随美帝，倒行逆施地迫害人民的罪行，正在遭到澳大利亚人民日益强烈的反对。
