The broad revolutionary masses of Changsha, the city where our great leader Chairman Mao first engaged in revolutionary activities, have been studying the communiqué of the Twelfth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee. They have been enthusiastically praising Chairman Mao's unparalleled wisdom and greatness, and have resolved to launch a new high tide of the mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's thoughts. They will resolutely fulfill the various great combat tasks proposed by the plenary session and forever follow Chairman Mao in marching forward bravely through stormy seas.

A Xinhua News Agency report from Changsha, dated November 13, states: The broad revolutionary masses of Changsha, the city where our great leader Chairman Mao first engaged in revolutionary activities, have been studying the communiqué of the Eighth Central Committee's enlarged Twelfth Plenary Session. With boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, they have been enthusiastically praising Chairman Mao's unparalleled wisdom and greatness, and enthusiastically praising the brilliant victories of Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They have resolved to launch a new high tide of the mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, and to resolutely fulfill the various great combat tasks proposed by the plenary session. They will forever follow Chairman Mao in marching forward bravely through stormy seas.

In Changsha, a city with a glorious revolutionary tradition, there are currently more than twenty sites commemorating Chairman Mao's revolutionary activities, each of which serves as an excellent classroom for learning and spreading the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. On the joyous day of the publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Twelfth Plenary Session, the broad masses of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, Red Guards, and revolutionary masses were overjoyed and their spirits soared. They held rallies to celebrate the publication of the communiqué, pledging their loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. At the same time, they held various discussion meetings, experience-sharing meetings, and organized various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They earnestly studied the communiqué, enthusiastically sang the praises of the great leader Chairman Mao, and enthusiastically sang the praises of the great victories of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They happily recalled how the great leader Chairman Mao organized the Marxist-Leninist Study Society, established the Communist Group, personally founded and nurtured the great Chinese Communist Party, and led the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They said, history has proven that Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, our great teacher, great leader, great helmsman, and great commander. All the victories of the Chinese revolution are the result of Chairman Mao's wise leadership, the great victories of Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts, and the great victories of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We must launch a new high tide of the mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, truly master Mao Zedong Thought, and ensure that our proletarian dictatorship remains unshakable.

The broad masses of bricklayers and carpenters in Changsha are currently studying, propagating, and implementing the communiqué and the various combat tasks proposed by the plenary session with unparalleled enthusiasm. They said, in the bitter days of the old society when "the night was long and the dawn was distant," the great leader Chairman Mao led the workers of Anshan Mine, Yuehan Railway, Changsha bricklayers, and Shuikou Mountain in launching a magnificent general strike, forming the first great high tide of the Chinese workers' movement. Forty-six years ago, the bricklayers of Changsha, under Chairman Mao's personal leadership, launched a general strike and achieved a great victory. This powerfully struck at the reactionary ruling forces, greatly boosted the morale of the working class, and greatly dampened the arrogance of the class enemies. Decades of revolutionary struggle have proven that it is only with Chairman Mao's wise and great leadership that we have the working class of today. In the suburbs of Changsha, where Chairman Mao conducted revolutionary activities in his early years and inspected in 1959, the poor and lower-middle peasants immediately organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes after the publication of the communiqué. In the study classes, they enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao's great achievements in leading the Chinese revolution with their personal experiences. A poor peasant, Zhang Jin Yun, who had the fortune of shaking hands with Chairman Mao during his inspection in 1959, said, before liberation, Juzi Zhou was a paradise for imperialists, bureaucrat capitalists, and landlords, and a living hell for the poor and lower-middle peasants. The great leader Chairman Mao led us to overthrow the three big mountains that had been weighing down on the Chinese people, allowing us to stand up and be liberated. However, Liu Shaoqi, this faithful dog of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, attempted to usurp the party, the army, and the government, and restore capitalism, dragging us back to the old path of exploitation and oppression. It was Chairman Mao who personally initiated and led this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, exposing Liu Shaoqi, this black hand behind the restoration of capitalism. We cheer a thousand times, ten thousand times for the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We vow to turn Juzi Zhou into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The broad masses of Red Guards and revolutionary students of the First Normal School of Hunan, under the leadership of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at the school, recently held a school-wide meeting to share experiences in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary students, with boundless reverence, discussed Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practices in his youth. They expressed their determination to, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, earnestly study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and cultivate themselves into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

The broad masses of residents of Qing Shui Tang, the former site of the CPC Hunan District Committee personally established by Chairman Mao, enthusiastically celebrated the publication of the communiqué of the plenary session. They recalled the decades-long course of the Chinese revolution and deeply felt that only Mao Zedong Thought could save China. Today, Chairman Mao has personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, smashing the bourgeois headquarters hidden within the party represented by Liu Shaoqi, consolidating the proletarian dictatorship, and preventing the restoration of capitalism. We must turn our boundless love for Chairman Mao into action in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, continue to vigorously organize Mao Zedong Thought study classes, carry forward the good study style of combining theory with practice advocated by Chairman Mao, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The broad revolutionary masses of Changsha have enthusiastically praised the great achievements of our great leader Chairman Mao, further igniting their deep proletarian feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao. Currently, a new high tide of the mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works is surging across the city. Many revolutionary workers and students in factories and schools have organized propaganda teams to go deep into the countryside and streets, enthusiastically propagating Mao Zedong Thought and the communiqué of the Eighth Twelfth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, and singing the praises of the great leader Chairman Mao. The various great combat tasks proposed by the Eighth Twelfth Plenary Session of the Central Committee are being earnestly implemented. The mass movement of struggle, criticism, and transformation is surging higher and higher, and both revolution and production have entered a new high tide.

　　紧跟伟大领袖毛主席在大风大浪中前进
    毛主席从事革命活动最早的光荣城市——长沙市的广大革命群众，在学习十二中全会公报中，热烈赞颂毛主席的无比英明伟大，决心掀起活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动的新高潮，坚决完成全会提出的各项伟大战斗任务
    新华社长沙十三日电　我们伟大领袖毛主席从事革命活动最早的光荣城市长沙市的广大革命群众，在学习党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报中，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠心，热烈赞颂毛主席的无比英明伟大，热烈赞颂毛泽东思想和毛主席无产阶级革命路线的光辉胜利。他们决心掀起活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动的新高潮，坚决完成全会提出的各项伟大战斗任务，永远紧跟毛主席，在大风大浪中奋勇前进。
    在具有光荣革命传统的长沙市，目前已经发现的毛主席革命活动纪念地达二十多处，处处都是学习和传播战无不胜的毛泽东思想的最好课堂。在党的八届十二中全会公报发表的大喜日子里，广大工人、贫下中农、红卫兵小将和革命群众，欢欣鼓舞，群情振奋。他们纷纷举行大会欢庆公报的发表，向伟大领袖毛主席表忠心；同时举行各种座谈会、讲用会，举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，认真学习公报，热情歌颂伟大领袖毛主席，热情歌颂战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。他们幸福地回顾了伟大领袖毛主席从在长沙组织马列主义研究会，成立共产主义小组，亲手缔造和培育伟大的中国共产党，一直到亲自发动和领导这次无产阶级文化大革命的光辉革命实践。他们说，历史事实证明，毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，是我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手，中国革命所取得的一切胜利，都是毛主席英明领导的结果，都是毛主席光辉思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利。我们一定要掀起活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的新高潮，把毛泽东思想真正学到手，保证我们无产阶级专政的铁打江山永不变色。
    长沙市广大泥木工人，正以无比的热情认真学习、宣传公报和落实全会提出的各项战斗任务。他们说，在旧社会那“长夜难明赤县天”的苦难岁月里，伟大领袖毛主席领导安源路矿、粤汉铁路、长沙泥木工人和水口山工人等，举行了轰轰烈烈的大罢工，组成了中国工人运动的第一个伟大高潮。四十六年前，我们长沙泥木工人在毛主席亲自发动、亲自领导下举行大罢工，获得伟大胜利，有力地打击了反动统治势力，大长了工人阶级的志气，大灭了阶级敌人的威风。几十年的革命斗争实践证明，有毛主席英明伟大的领导，才有我们工人阶级的今天。在毛主席早年从事过革命活动、一九五九年六月二十四日又来进行过视察的长沙市郊桔子洲的贫下中农，公报发表以后立即举办了毛泽东思想学习班。他们在学习班里以亲身的经历，热情赞颂毛主席领导中国革命的丰功伟绩。一九五九年毛主席视察这里时曾幸福地同毛主席握过手的贫农社员张紧云说，解放前的桔子洲，是帝国主义者、官僚资本家和地主的天堂，是贫下中农的活地狱。伟大领袖毛主席领导我们，推翻了压在中国人民头上的三座大山，才使我们翻身得到解放。但是，刘少奇这条帝、修、反的忠实走狗，妄图篡党、篡军、篡政，复辟资本主义，把我们拖回到受剥削、受压迫的老路上去。又是毛主席亲自发动和领导了这场无产阶级文化大革命，把刘少奇这个复辟资本主义的黑后台给挖了出来。我们一千遍一万遍地欢呼毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，一定要永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，誓把桔子洲头办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    湖南第一师范学校的广大红卫兵小将和革命师生，在驻校工人毛泽东思想宣传队的领导下，最近召开了全校活学活用毛泽东思想的讲用大会。革命师生怀着无限崇敬的心情，畅谈了毛主席青年时代的伟大革命实践。他们表示，一定要怀着对毛主席无限忠诚的红心，认真学好用好毛主席著作，把自己培养成无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。
    毛主席亲自创建的中共湘区委员会旧址——清水塘的广大街道居民，在欢呼全会公报发表的时候，回顾了几十年来中国革命的战斗历程，深深感到只有毛泽东思想才能救中国。今天，毛主席又亲自发动和领导了无产阶级文化大革命，摧毁了以刘少奇为代表的隐藏在党内的资产阶级司令部，巩固了无产阶级专政，防止了资本主义复辟。我们要把对毛主席无限热爱的颗颗忠心，用在活学活用毛泽东思想上，继续大力办好毛泽东思想学习班，发扬毛主席亲自倡导的理论联系实际的好学风，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    长沙市广大革命群众热烈赞颂我们伟大领袖毛主席的丰功伟绩，更加激发了他们永远忠于毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情。目前，一个活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动新高潮正在全市兴起。许多工厂、学校的革命职工和革命师生，纷纷组织宣传队深入农村、街道，热情宣传毛泽东思想，宣传党的八届十二中全会公报，纵情歌颂伟大领袖毛主席。党的八届十二中全会提出的各项伟大战斗任务，正在认真得到落实，全市斗、批、改的群众运动一浪高过一浪，革命和生产都出现了新的高潮。
