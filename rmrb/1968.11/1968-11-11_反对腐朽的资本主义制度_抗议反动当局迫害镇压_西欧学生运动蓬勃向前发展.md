Students in many Western European countries have launched a vigorous struggle against the decaying capitalist education system and to protest the authorities' persecution and suppression of students. The wave of students' just struggles has surged, striking at the dying capitalist system.

The tide of student struggle in France is rising again.

In the French capital Paris, hundreds of students from the Paris School of Fine Arts reoccupied the school buildings on the 6th and 7th to protest against the unreasonable graduation system. The French authorities sent a large number of police to violently suppress the students and force them out of the campus. The students sang the "Internationale" and shouted slogans against the bourgeois reactionary rule, bravely fighting back against the police.

In the western French port city of Nantes, over 600 students occupied the law school of Nantes University on the 7th. In the southeastern city of Grenoble, 200 university students occupied the science college of Grenoble University on the 6th and 7th, opposing the decaying capitalist education system. The reactionary school administration immediately cut off water and electricity supplies, but the students continued their struggle, forcing the dean of the science college to resign.

In Paris, Marseille, and Corsica, middle school students also went on strike and demonstrated, protesting the reactionary authorities' persecution of students.

In addition, in Strasbourg, when the U.S. Ambassador to France was conducting reactionary propaganda in a hotel, some students rushed into the hotel, shouting slogans condemning U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam.

Students across Italy launched large-scale struggles on the 8th to oppose the decaying capitalist education system.

In the northern Italian city of Bologna, students bravely occupied the law school, economics school, and political science school, expressing their opposition to the decaying capitalist education system.

In Milan, the second-largest city in Italy, students from the Catholic University, known for its strict reactionary rule, also joined the student struggle wave. Many students held protest meetings, demanding the abolition of the unreasonable entrance examination system.

In the Italian cities of Imola and Bari, student crowds held demonstrations on the streets, protesting the reactionary measures of the school authorities. The students fought fiercely with the police who came to suppress them.

In Palermo, the capital of the Italian region of Sicily, 10,000 students from primary and secondary schools held a massive demonstration in the city center on the 5th, defying the heavy rain. They protested against the brutal persecution of students by the Italian reactionary ruling clique and opposed the decaying capitalist education system, causing all schools from primary to university in the city to suspend classes.

The students in Palermo, despite the repeated persecution and suppression by the Italian reactionary ruling clique, have been persistently fighting. Last month on the 25th, students in Palermo held a citywide strike and raised a red flag on the roof of the main post office in the city center.

Over 100 students from Oxford University held a demonstration on the 5th, opposing the decaying bourgeois education system.

The demonstrating students started from All Souls College of Oxford University and marched to the university's administrative office, demanding to submit a statement to the school authorities to reform the decaying British education system. The students' reasonable demands were rudely rejected by the reactionary school authorities. The demonstrating students bravely fought against the reactionary school authorities, linking arms and charging towards the meeting room where the school heads were holding a meeting, making the meeting impossible to continue. The participants had to slip away through a side door.

The demonstrating students persisted in their struggle, surrounding the office of the proctor who was in charge of monitoring students. The students' struggle forced the proctor to come out and accept the statement against the decaying education system submitted by the student representatives.

About 1,000 students from the University of Madrid in Spain defied the reactionary authorities' ban and held a mass meeting in the philosophy and literature departments on the 5th, protesting against the fascist rule of the Franco regime.

This meeting was held after the Spanish reactionary authorities sent a large number of police into the campus to suppress the students who persisted in their struggle. At the meeting, students mourned a Spanish poet who had recently been unjustly exiled and died. Students from the law school of the University of Madrid also held a protest meeting on the same day. The University of Madrid authorities were terrified and sent two emergency reports to the reactionary government within a day, requesting the immediate dispatch of more police to the school to suppress the students.

Students at the University of Madrid persisted in their struggle.

Following the strong protests and demonstrations held by thousands of students on November 5th and October 31st, students from many departments of this university continued their strike struggles. By the 9th, veterinary students had been on strike for five days, opposing the unreasonable textbooks prescribed by the school authorities; law students also announced a strike, protesting the school authorities' unreasonable ban on student representatives entering the school; economics students also went on strike, supporting their fellow students who were fighting and protesting the authorities' dispatch of police into the campus to suppress them.
