Inspired by the spirit of the Party's Eighth Plenary Session of the Twelfth Central Committee, comrades from a certain artillery company's wireless platoon stationed at the Hengyang Railway Station in Hunan Province were overjoyed upon hearing the great news of the session's public report over the radio. They repeatedly raised their arms and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!" They unanimously praised the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led and initiated by Chairman Mao. The more they discussed, the more excited they became. Platoon leader Huang Minglong said excitedly, "Chairman Mao is the great savior of the Chinese people. Following Chairman Mao means victory. Today, he has issued a new battle order. We must march forward swiftly and charge into battle. Shall we express our loyalty to Chairman Mao now?" The platoon leader's words resonated with everyone's hearts. The comrades had long harbored this wish and unanimously replied, "Good!" The company commander Zhao Jingfeng, who was on duty with the wireless platoon, said, "We love Chairman Mao, and billions of people love Chairman Mao. Why not organize the passengers to express their loyalty to Chairman Mao together?" The company commander's words received unanimous agreement from everyone.

In the waiting room, passengers were gathered in groups discussing the great significance of the session's public report. The comrades from the wireless platoon entered the waiting room, and the platoon leader raised his voice, saying, "Revolutionary passengers, the Party's Eighth Plenary Session of the Twelfth Central Committee, presided over by Chairman Mao, has concluded successfully. This is a great joy for the people of the entire country and the people of the whole world." The entire waiting room immediately buzzed with excitement, and the shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" grew louder and louder. The platoon leader, unable to contain his extreme joy, continued, "Chairman Mao is far-sighted and great. He leads us in revolution, from one victory to another. The Party's Eighth Plenary Session of the Twelfth Central Committee, presided over by Chairman Mao, scientifically summarized the great victories of the Cultural Revolution over the past two years, expelled the traitor, spy, and capitalist roader Liu Shaoqi from the party forever, and revoked all his positions within and outside the party. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. Now, Chairman Mao has pointed out a new direction for us and issued a new order. To express our heartfelt wishes, shall we express our loyalty to Chairman Mao?" The waiting room erupted in excitement. People held up the Little Red Book and lined up in an orderly manner in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, singing "The East Is Red." As the song ended, a group of organized workers were the first to solemnly pledge to Chairman Mao, "Chairman Mao, you are the great teacher of the working class. The working class will forever be loyal to you. Today, the Eighth Plenary Session of the Twelfth Central Committee, presided over by you, has issued a new order for us. We will carry it out one thousand times and follow it one million times! We promise you that we will strive to make the revolution better and push production to new heights, answering your concern." A group of poor and lower-middle peasants, preparing to visit Chairman Mao's hometown of Shaoshan, solemnly pledged, holding up red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," "Trees have roots, water has a source. We poor and lower-middle peasants have risen because of Chairman Mao. Our happy life comes from the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants, will forever be loyal to you. We will resolutely carry out the various combat tasks proposed in the public report, launch an even greater agricultural production high tide, produce more grain, support the country, and support the world revolution, and express our loyalty to you with practical actions."

A group of students from Guangzhou, who were passing through, followed Chairman Mao's teachings to walk the path of integrating with workers and peasants, and with revolutionary enthusiasm rushed to the countryside. Seeing everyone expressing their loyalty to Chairman Mao, they also lined up and rushed over. With tears of excitement, they solemnly pledged to Chairman Mao, "Chairman Mao, you have pointed out the correct revolutionary path for us young intellectuals. This public report has once again shown us the direction. We feel even happier. In the future, in the countryside, we will resolutely unite with the poor and lower-middle peasants, fight shoulder to shoulder, and in the struggle, get a body full of mud, thoroughly clean up the poison of the revisionist educational line, and become a genuine revolutionary successor." People expressing their loyalty to Chairman Mao came one after another. The comrades from the wireless platoon also expressed their loyalty to Chairman Mao together with everyone. The waiting room was filled with a joyful atmosphere, and the shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" echoed continuously.

    在党的八届十二中全会公报的鼓舞下
    无限热爱毛主席，候车室里表忠心
    正在湖南省衡阳火车站担任执勤的某部迫炮一连无线班的同志们，从广播里听到党的八届十二中全会公报发表这一特大喜讯后，无不欢喜若狂，不断振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”他们共同衷心颂扬毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利，颂扬毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。大家在一起越谈心情越激动。班长黄明长兴奋地说：“毛主席是中国人民的大救星，紧跟毛主席就是胜利，今天他老人家又发出了新的战斗号令，我们要飞步前进，冲锋陷阵。现在我们向毛主席表忠心好不好？”班长的话说到了大家的心坎里，同志们早有这个心愿，异口同声地回答：“好！”和无线班一块执勤的连长赵京峰说：“我们热爱毛主席，亿万人民都热爱毛主席，咱们组织旅客们一块向毛主席表忠心不更好吗？”连长的话得到了大家的一致同意。
    候车室里旅客们正三三两两地围在一块谈论全会公报的伟大意义。无线班的同志走进候车室，班长提高嗓子说：“革命的旅客同志们，毛主席他老人家亲自主持召开的党的八届十二中全会胜利结束了，这是全国人民的大喜事，全世界人民的大喜事。”整个候车室立即沸腾起来，“毛主席万岁！”的欢呼声一阵高过一阵。班长抑制不住万分喜悦的心情，接着说：“毛主席高瞻远瞩，英明伟大，领导我们闹革命，从一个胜利走向一个胜利。他老人家亲自主持召开的党的八届十二中全会，科学地总结了两年来文化大革命的伟大胜利，把刘少奇这个叛徒、内奸、工贼永远开除出党，并撤消其党内外一切职务，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。如今他老人家又给我们指出了新的方向，发出了新的号令，为了表达我们的衷心愿望，大家来向毛主席表忠心好不好？”候车室里一片欢腾。人们手捧宝书，有秩序地列队在毛主席像前，高唱《东方红》。歌声刚落，一队有组织的工人首先向毛主席庄严宣誓：“毛主席啊，毛主席！您是我们工人阶级的伟大导师，工人阶级永远忠于您。今天您老人家亲自主持召开的八届十二中全会，给我们发出了新号令，我们一千个执行！一万个照办！我们向您老人家保证，誓把革命抓得更好，把生产推向高峰，回答您老人家的关怀。”正准备前往毛主席家乡韶山参观的一队贫下中农，高举着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，庄严宣誓：“树有根，水有源，我们贫下中农翻身全靠毛主席，幸福生活来自战无不胜的毛泽东思想，我们贫下中农世世代代忠于您的红心永不变。我们坚决执行公报提出的各项战斗任务，掀起更大的农业生产高潮，多打粮食，支援国家，支援世界革命，以实际行动向您老人家敬献忠心。”
    路经这里的一批广州市的中学生，他们遵照毛主席的教导走与工农相结合道路，满怀革命豪情奔赴农村，看到大家向毛主席表忠心，也列队赶来。他们含着激动的泪水，庄严地向毛主席宣誓：“毛主席啊，毛主席！您老人家给知识青年指出的革命道路无比正确。这次全会公报再次给我们指明了方向，我们感到更加幸福。今后在农村里，我们坚决和贫下中农打成一片，并肩战斗，在斗争中滚一身泥巴，把修正主义教育路线的流毒彻底肃清，做一个名副其实的革命接班人。”向毛主席表忠心的人一个接一个，无线班的同志也同大家一起向毛主席表了忠心。候车室里一片欢乐气氛，不断响着“毛主席万岁！”的欢呼声。
