Title: To Occupy, Not to Decorate

During the high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation, groups of workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams have marched into various departments of the ideological and cultural realm, leading the struggle, criticism, and transformation there.

The working class occupying all ideological and cultural positions fully demonstrates the leadership role of the working class. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres of the proletariat cheer and applaud. However, a small handful of class enemies have been whispering behind the scenes, sneering and saying, "Hmm! Bringing in a few workers to decorate the place is fine, but if they really want to lead, we'll just have to see about that!"

The working class must occupy all ideological and cultural positions and transform the superstructure in accordance with the image of the working class. On this issue, there has always been a fierce struggle between two classes and two lines. For a long time, the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev have used the ideological and cultural positions as their forward positions for restoring capitalism. They have long controlled the schools, and on the socialist stage of literature and art, there are weeds everywhere and demons dancing wildly, "never advocating to be led by the proletariat, never approving of it."

The bourgeoisie resists the leadership of the working class. Their usual tactics are: three "removals." First, "cannot enter": under the rule of the revisionist literary black line, workers, peasants, and soldiers have no hope of entering the political stage of the superstructure. Those bourgeois reactionary "authorities" play tricks, setting up various rules and regulations to keep workers, peasants, and soldiers out. Second, "drive out": out of their anti-party and anti-socialist needs, for the sake of decoration, they sometimes borrow the name of "cultivation" to stuff a few workers and peasants into the high towers and deep courtyards they control. But, "when Jian dances with his sword, his intention is towards Pei." When these workers and peasants insist on transforming the superstructure with the image of the working class, they reveal their ferocious faces and try every means to drive you out. Third, "pull over": besides openly resisting the leadership of the working class, they use fame and success as bait to "pull you over." Some writers of worker and peasant origin sliding into the revisionist quagmire day by day are evidence of this. Looking back at the past deeds of those bourgeois lords and listening to their various slanders and curses today about the working class entering the ideological and cultural positions, their intentions are indeed malicious.

The working class entering various departments of the superstructure is a great strategic deployment of our great leader Chairman Mao, not just a decoration, but to occupy permanently, to use Mao Zedong Thought to transform those places, and to turn the upside-down history back to its rightful place. Those who were once despised by the bourgeois lords as "big roughnecks," workers, peasants, and soldiers, are a hundred times, a thousand times, ten thousand times better than "foreign scholars." The workers, peasants, and soldiers who live every day in the front lines of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation are the "most intelligent, most talented, and most experienced warriors." They have boundless love for our great leader Chairman Mao and deep hatred for China's Khrushchev. Their strength is invincible, and their wisdom is boundless.

"Ask the vast land, who controls the rise and fall?" Now the world has entered an era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner. The working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought will definitely and completely be able to occupy all ideological and cultural positions and become the masters of the great new era.

    是“占领”不是“点缀”
    上海工总司工人业余大批判组　林深
    在斗、批、改高潮中，一支支工人毛泽东思想宣传队，昂首阔步开进思想文化领域各部门，领导那里的斗、批、改。
    工人阶级占领一切思想文化阵地，充分显示出工人阶级的领导作用，广大无产阶级革命派为此欢呼叫好。可是，一小撮阶级敌人，却在阴山背后窃窃私语，掩鼻嗤笑说：“嗯！弄几个工人来点缀点缀还可以，真的要领导，那可要等着瞧啦！”
    工人阶级要占领一切思想文化阵地，按工人阶级的面貌去改造上层建筑各个领域，在这个问题上历来就存在着两个阶级、两条路线的激烈斗争。长期以来，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，把思想文化阵地作为他们复辟资本主义的前哨阵地。他们长期统治着学校，在社会主义的文艺舞台上，也是毒草丛生，群妖乱舞，“从不提倡要受无产阶级的领导，从来也不要批准。”
    资产阶级抗拒工人阶级的领导，他们惯用的手法是：三个“去”，其一是：“进不去”，在修正主义文艺黑线的统治下，工农兵是休想进入上层建筑各个领域政治舞台的，那些资产阶级反动“权威”故弄玄虚，订出种种清规戒律，把工农兵拒之门外；其二是：“赶出去”，出于他们反党反社会主义的需要，为了装点门面起见，有时也借“培养”之名，在他们所把持的高楼深院里，塞进几个工农分子。可是，“项庄舞剑，意在沛公。”当这些工农群众坚持用工人阶级面貌去改造上层建筑时，他们就露出凶相，想尽办法把你赶出门去；其三是：“拉过去”，资产阶级除了明目张胆地排斥工人阶级领导以外，他们以成名成家为诱饵，把你“拉过去”。一些工农出身的作家，一天天滑进修正主义泥坑就是明证。回顾那些资产阶级老爷过去的所作所为，听听他们今天对于工人阶级进驻思想文化阵地的种种污蔑、谩骂，居心何其毒也。
    工人阶级进驻上层建筑各个领域，是伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略部署，决不是什么点缀，而是要永远占领，要用毛泽东思想去改造那些地方，把颠倒的历史重新颠倒过来。被那些资产阶级老爷轻蔑为“大老粗”的工农兵，就是胜过“洋秀才”百倍，千倍，万倍。整天生活在阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验第一线的工农兵群众，就是“最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”他们对我们伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱，对中国赫鲁晓夫刻骨仇恨。他们的力量是无敌的，他们的智慧是无穷无尽的。
    “问苍茫大地，谁主沉浮？”现在世界正进入一个以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的时代。由毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级，一定要而且完全有能力去占领一切思想文化阵地，成为伟大新时代的主人。工农兵论坛
