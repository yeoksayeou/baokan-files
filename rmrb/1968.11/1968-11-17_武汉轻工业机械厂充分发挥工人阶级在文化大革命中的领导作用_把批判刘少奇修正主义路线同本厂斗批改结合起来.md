The Wuhan Light Industry Machinery Factory has fully played the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution, combining the criticism of the revisionist line of the traitor Liu Shaoqi with the factory's struggle, criticism, and transformation. The workers have taken control of the struggle, criticism, and transformation, using Mao Zedong Thought to criticize and transform everything. They have not only criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the traitor Liu Shaoqi but have also pushed the factory's struggle, criticism, and transformation to a deeper level. Recently, the factory revolutionary committee, inspired by the report of the 12th Plenary Session of the Party's 8th Central Committee, has summarized the experiences of the previous stage and decided to further play the leading role of the working class, implementing the great battle tasks proposed in the report.

The factory revolutionary committee, with the help of the PLA's support-left personnel stationed in the factory, has followed the great teachings of Chairman Mao Zedong on "the working class must lead everything." They have allowed the workers to take control of the struggle, criticism, and transformation, using Mao Zedong Thought to criticize and transform everything, achieving good results. Currently, the struggle, criticism, and transformation movement led by the working class in this factory is advancing step by step along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao.

The working class must take control of the power of the great criticism to play a leading role in the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

After the establishment of the Wuhan Light Industry Machinery Factory Revolutionary Committee, under the guidance of Chairman Mao Zedong's latest instructions, the entire factory launched a struggle, criticism, and transformation movement. However, at the beginning, due to an insufficient understanding of the importance of the working class taking control of the power of the struggle, criticism, and transformation, it was limited to a few "eloquent and literate" cadres and intellectuals. Therefore, the revolutionary criticism was cold and lifeless.

At this critical moment, Chairman Mao Zedong's latest instructions came: "Our country has 700 million people. The working class is the leading class. We must fully play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work. The working class should also continuously improve its political awareness in the struggle." Everyone repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and realized that to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation well, we must fully play the leading role of the working class. Based on this understanding, the factory revolutionary committee, on the one hand, absorbed a number of workers into the factory and workshop leadership teams for the struggle, criticism, and transformation; on the other hand, held Mao Zedong Thought study classes to organize workers to deeply study Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Many workers said with revolutionary enthusiasm: "We have an account of bitterness against the old society; we have a blood debt against the class enemies. The power of the factory's struggle, criticism, and transformation, we must take control of, and the working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought has the most say."

The working class took control of the power of the struggle, criticism, and transformation, leading the broad masses of workers to take active action, criticizing the poison spread by the traitor Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and criticizing the crimes of the factory's capitalist roaders and reactionary "technical authorities," making the revolutionary criticism flourish.

This factory had a bourgeois reactionary "technical authority" who was also a spy infiltrating the revolutionary ranks. Before the Cultural Revolution, the factory's capitalist roaders, following Liu Shaoqi's black instructions of "experts running the factory" and "technology in command," elevated him to the skies, allowing this bad guy to ride roughshod over the workers for a long time, acting arrogantly. When workers occasionally sought his help to solve production problems, he waved his hand and said harshly, "Even if I explain, you won't understand. You are useless!" During the great criticism, veteran workers used their lunch break to hold an on-site criticism meeting. This on-site criticism meeting greatly boosted the morale of the working class and crushed the arrogance of the bourgeoisie, shaking the entire factory.

The factory revolutionary committee enthusiastically promoted the experience of veteran workers' revolutionary criticism to the entire factory. Thus, various forms of revolutionary criticism flourished throughout the factory.

Only by carrying forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the working class can we achieve thorough criticism, deep excavation, and quick transformation.

The revolutionary criticism hit the vital points of the class enemies, disrupting their plans. A small handful of class enemies spread the word everywhere: "They have been criticized, struggled against, and transformed. It's almost enough." They attempted to shift the focus of the struggle and sabotage the struggle, criticism, and transformation. The PLA support-left personnel and revolutionary committee members in the study class, together with the workers, further studied the great teachings of Chairman Mao Zedong: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not resign themselves to their defeat. They will make their last struggle. After the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways every day and every hour, trying to restore their rule in China. This is inevitable and beyond doubt. We must never relax our vigilance." They also analyzed the new situation, new characteristics, and new trends of class struggle in the factory, realizing that although some class enemies have been exposed, the work of cleaning up the class ranks still needs to be further deepened. They combined this with the work of cleaning up the class ranks, thoroughly criticized Liu Shaoqi's advocacy of the "theory of the extinction of class struggle," greatly raising the class struggle awareness of the broad masses of workers and greatly strengthening their determination to carry the revolution through to the end.

The oil painting group in the third workshop had a bad element who often made reactionary remarks, which did not attract much attention. This time, after everyone sharpened their eyes and analyzed the situation, it turned out to be a current counter-revolutionary who insisted on a reactionary stance, consistently opposed the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought. Following this, the entire factory's workers concentrated their efforts, pursuing and attacking, focusing on this bad element's counter-revolutionary fallacies, and carried out struggle and criticism. The workers in the construction group compared this bad element's crimes with the situation in their group and immediately exposed another current counter-revolutionary. At this time, the class struggle atmosphere in the entire factory became more intense, big-character posters and big slogans covered the walls, struggle meetings followed one after another, and a small handful of class enemies were isolated. Chairman Mao Zedong taught us: "Counter-revolutionaries who appear in disguise hide their true nature but reveal their false nature. But since they are counter-revolutionaries, they cannot completely hide their true nature." The broad masses of workers studied Chairman Mao's teachings, based on these elements' crimes, and further enriched the content of the revolutionary criticism by criticizing Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and "theory of the tamed tool," becoming more critical and exposing three deeply hidden counter-revolutionaries in a short period.

Only by using the advanced thoughts of the working class to criticize everything can we transform everything in the image of the proletariat.

For a long time, the capitalist roaders in this factory stubbornly pushed Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, handing over the technical power in the factory to a Kuomintang spy and reactionary "technical authority." They also set up a large number of departments and unreasonable regulations to serve the revisionist line, seriously restricting the initiative and creativity of the workers. Since the establishment of the factory revolutionary committee this January, they have tried many times to reform unreasonable regulations but have not succeeded. Some committee members still spend their days in the office building. The workers saw this situation and had many opinions. "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism, is revolution.... Destruction comes first, and construction is within it." The great voice of Chairman Mao awakened them. With the help of the PLA support-left personnel stationed in the factory, the factory revolutionary committee seized this key point, mobilized the masses, and launched a deep and sustained revolutionary criticism. During the great criticism, combined with the history of the two-line struggle since the founding of the factory, they repeatedly criticized Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the factory who stubbornly pushed the counter-revolutionary revisionist goods of "experts running the factory," etc. In this way, they not only exposed and criticized the counter-revolutionary crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his agents but also made the broad masses of workers more consciously use Chairman Mao's great teachings as weapons, seeing through the confusing phenomena and understanding the essence of revisionism, further clarifying the direction of reform. The workers said: The advanced thoughts of the working class are Mao Zedong Thought. Using proletarian thoughts to transform everything is to use Mao Zedong Thought to transform everything. In the revolutionary criticism, we must more consciously grasp Mao Zedong Thought.

The first workshop is one of the workshops with the worst production equipment in the factory. In the past, workers, in order to change this backward situation, used old scrap materials and took the initiative to innovate a soil hoist and an electric sand screening machine. However, the capitalist roaders in this factory, pushing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line of "experts running the factory," obstructed and destroyed the workers' innovations in every possible way. The workers in this workshop held an on-site criticism meeting, through a clear contrast, further aroused the workers' great indignation against the capitalist roaders, reactionary "technical authorities," and their backer Liu Shaoqi, greatly mobilizing the workers' revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity, and strongly promoting the development of production.

Inspired by the first workshop, the workers of the entire factory launched a fierce attack on the superstructure that did not adapt to the socialist economic base. The broad masses of workers seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings on streamlining administration, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, concentrating on the crimes of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the construction of political power, and carried out extensive exposure, criticism, and struggle. Through these activities, everyone deeply realized that whether to reform the old institutions or not is a big issue related to the direction of the enterprise and a big issue related to whether the proletarian heaven changes color, thus promoting the smooth progress of the factory's streamlining work. The new administrative structure was streamlined from the original seven departments, four offices, and one section with 109 people to two groups with 32 people, establishing systems such as cadres participating in labor and workers participating in management. The technical personnel who used to have their heads against the ceiling, feet on the floor, and faces against the drawing board also all walked out of the office, going to the front line of class struggle and production struggle, receiving re-education from the working class.

The experience of the Wuhan Light Industry Machinery Factory in combining the criticism of the traitor Liu Shaoqi with the struggle, criticism, and transformation has attracted the attention of many units in Wuhan. Not long ago, the Wuhan Municipal Revolutionary Committee introduced their experience to the entire city. Recently, the factory revolutionary committee, greatly inspired by the report of the 8th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee, is following Chairman Mao's great teachings, using the dialectical view of one divides into two, mobilizing the masses, summarizing the experiences of the previous stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation, determined to further rely on the workers in the great wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation, more firmly play the leading role of the working class, deeply and sustainably carry out revolutionary criticism, thoroughly eliminate the poison of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, achieve the battle tasks proposed by the plenary session, and seize the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution.

　　武汉轻工业机械厂充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中的领导作用
　　把批判刘少奇修正主义路线同本厂斗批改结合起来
    工人群众掌握斗、批、改的大权，用毛泽东思想批判一切，改造一切，既批判了叛徒刘少奇反革命修正主义办厂路线，又推动本厂斗、批、改向纵深发展。最近，厂革委会在党的十二中全会公报鼓舞下，总结前阶段的经验，决心进一步发挥工人阶级的领导作用，实现公报提出的伟大战斗任务
    本报讯　怎样把批判叛徒刘少奇反革命修正主义路线，同本单位斗、批、改结合起来？武汉轻工业机械厂革委会在解放军驻厂支左人员的帮助下，遵循伟大领袖毛主席关于“工人阶级必须领导一切”的伟大教导，让工人群众掌握斗、批、改的大权，用毛泽东思想去批判一切，改造一切，收到了很好效果。目前，这个厂以工人阶级为主力军的斗、批、改群众运动，正沿着毛主席指引的方向，步步向纵深发展。
    工人阶级只有掌管革命大批判的大权，才能在斗、批、改中发挥领导作用
    武汉轻工业机械厂革委会成立后，在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，全厂掀起了斗、批、改群众运动。但是，开始时，因为对工人阶级掌管斗、批、改的大权的重要性认识不足，只局限在少数“能说会写”的干部和知识分子身上，因此，革命的大批判搞得冷冷清清。
    在这个关键时候，传来了伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”大家反复学习了毛主席的最新指示，认识到搞好斗、批、改，必须充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用。在提高认识的基础上，厂革委会一面吸收一部分工人参加厂和车间斗、批、改的领导班子；一面举办毛泽东思想学习班，组织工人群众深入学习毛主席的最新指示。许多工人满怀革命豪情地说：“对旧社会，我们有一本苦情账；对阶级敌人，我们有一笔血泪仇。工厂斗、批、改的大权我们要掌，用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级最有发言权。”
    工人阶级掌握斗、批、改的大权，领导广大工人群众积极行动起来，既批判叛徒刘少奇反革命修正主义路线所散布的流毒，又批判本厂走资派和反动技术“权威”的罪行，使革命大批判如火如荼地开展起来。这个厂有个资产阶级反动技术“权威”，又是个混进革命队伍的特务分子。无产阶级文化大革命前，厂里的走资派按照刘少奇“专家治厂”、“技术挂帅”的黑指示，把他捧上了天，使这个坏家伙长期骑在工人头上，作威作福。工人偶尔找他解决生产中的问题，他把手一扬，恶狠狠地说：“我讲了你们也不懂，你们没有用！”在大批判中，老工人利用中午休息时间，开了个现场批判会。这个现场批判会大长了工人阶级的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风，震动了全厂。
    厂革委会满腔热情地及时向全厂推广了老工人进行革命大批判的经验。于是，全厂多种多样形式的革命大批判蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来。
    只有发扬工人阶级的彻底革命精神，才能做到狠批，深挖，快改
    革命的大批判，击中了阶级敌人的要害，打乱了他们的阵脚，一小撮阶级敌人到处散布说：“揪也揪了，批也批了，改也改了，差不多了。”妄图转移斗争目标，破坏斗、批、改。解放军驻厂支左人员和革委会的同志在学习班里，和工人一起进一步学习伟大领袖毛主席的伟大教导：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”并且结合本厂阶级斗争实际，具体分析了阶级斗争的新形势，新特点，新动向，他们认识到：阶级敌人虽然挖出来一些，但清理阶级队伍的工作还需要进一步深入开展。他们结合清理阶级队伍工作，狠批刘少奇鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，大大提高了广大工人群众阶级斗争觉悟，大大增强了将革命进行到底的决心。
    三车间油漆组有个坏家伙，平时有些反动言论，没有引起人们注意。这次大家擦亮眼睛一分析，原来是个坚持反动立场，一贯反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的现行反革命分子。接着，全厂工人集中力量，穷追猛打，针对这个坏家伙的反革命谬论，开展了批斗。基建组的工人们拿这个坏家伙的罪行一对照组里的情况，马上挖出了另一个现行反革命分子。这时，全厂阶级斗争空气越搞越浓，大字报，大标语铺天盖地，斗争会一个接一个，一小撮阶级敌人陷于孤立。伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“以伪装出现的反革命分子，他们给人以假象，而将真象荫蔽着。但是他们既要反革命，就不可能将其真象荫蔽得十分彻底。”广大工人群众学习毛主席的教导，根据这些家伙的罪行，又结合批判了刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”和“驯服工具论”，进一步丰富了革命大批判的内容，越批，眼睛越亮，在短短几天之内，挖出了三个隐藏很深的反革命分子。
    只有用工人阶级的先进思想批判一切，才能按照无产阶级面貌改造一切
　　长期以来，这个厂的走资派顽固推行刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，把厂里的技术大权交给了一个国民党特务、反动技术“权威”。他们还搞了一套为修正主义路线服务的庞大的科室和不合理的规章制度，严重地束缚了工人群众的积极性和创造性。今年元月，厂革委会成立以来，多次想改革不合理的规章制度，但都没有实现，革委会一些干部仍然成天蹲在办公楼里。工人群众看到这种状况，意见很多。“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。……破字当头，立也就在其中了。”伟大领袖毛主席的声音唤醒了他们，厂革委会在解放军驻厂支左人员帮助下，抓住这个要害，放手发动群众，开展了一场深入持久的革命大批判。在大批判中，结合建厂以来两条路线斗争的历史，反复批判刘少奇及其在本厂代理人顽固推行的“专家治厂”等反革命修正主义黑货。这样，既揭露和批判了刘少奇及其代理人的反革命罪行，又使广大工人群众更加自觉地以毛主席的伟大教导为武器，透过纷纭的现象，看出了修正主义的实质，进一步明确了改革的方向。工人们说：工人阶级的先进思想就是毛泽东思想，用无产阶级的思想改造一切，就是用毛泽东思想改造一切，在革命大批判中，我们要更加自觉地掌握好毛泽东思想。
    一车间是全厂生产设备最差的车间之一。过去工人们为了改变这种落后状态，曾利用旧废料，自己动手，先后革新了一台土吊车和电动筛砂机。但是，这个厂的走资派推行刘少奇“专家治厂”的反革命修正主义路线，对工人的革新创造百般阻挠，横加破坏。这个车间的工人开了个现场批判会，通过鲜明的对比，更加激起了工人群众对走资派、反动技术“权威”以及他们的总后台刘少奇的无比愤慨，大大调动了工人群众的革命积极性和创造性，有力地推动了生产的发展。
    全厂工人群众在一车间的带动下，向不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑，发动了猛烈的冲击。广大工人群众认真学习了毛主席有关精兵简政的教导，以毛泽东思想为武器，集中地对刘少奇在政权建设方面推行的反革命修正主义路线的罪行，展开了大揭发、大批判、大斗争。通过这些活动，使大家深刻认识到：旧的机构改还是不改，是关系到企业走什么道路的大问题，是关系到无产阶级江山变不变色的大问题，从而推动了全厂精简工作的顺利进行。新的办事机构由原来七科、四室、一处一百零九人，精简为两个组三十二人，建立了干部参加劳动以及工人参加管理等制度。原来头顶天花板、脚踏地板、面对图板的技术人员，也都全部走出办公室，到阶级斗争和生产斗争第一线，接受工人阶级的再教育。
    武汉轻工业机械厂把批判叛徒刘少奇和斗、批、改结合起来的经验，引起了武汉许多单位的重视。前不久，武汉市革委会向全市介绍了他们的经验。最近，这个厂的革委会在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的极大鼓舞下，正遵循毛主席的伟大教导，运用一分为二的辩证观点，发动群众，总结前段斗、批、改的经验，决心在伟大的斗、批、改高潮中，更加坚定不移地依靠工人群众，进一步发挥工人阶级的领导作用，深入持久地开展革命大批判，彻底肃清刘少奇反革命修正主义路线的流毒，实现全会提出的战斗任务，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
