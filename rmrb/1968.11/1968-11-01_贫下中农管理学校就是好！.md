Recently, I read the series of investigative reports published in the newspaper about the poor and lower-middle peasants managing schools. Seeing that we poor and lower-middle peasants have taken control of the schools and become the main force of the rural proletarian cultural revolution, we have resolutely implemented the latest directive of our great leader Chairman Mao: "In the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants." I am genuinely overjoyed. These investigative reports are vivid and clear, expressing the hearts of the broad laboring masses. The poor and lower-middle peasants managing schools is great! It is excellent!

The children of us poor and lower-middle peasants, before liberation, could not even eat enough, so how could they go to school? Even if the elders went without food and clothing to save money to send us to school, we were still discriminated against and bullied in school. Our dearest leader, Chairman Mao, liberated us, enabling us to stand up politically and economically. However, due to the dominance of the revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev, we poor and lower-middle peasants have not been able to stand up culturally for over a decade.

Just take the situation I saw in 1965 when I participated in the rural "Four Cleanups": among the twelve households of poor and lower-middle peasants in the fourth brigade of Tongyu, more than half of the youth had never been to school. Of the few who had gone to school, even reading a newspaper was difficult. I asked a poor peasant why she did not let her children go to school. She said, "The teachers in school say our children are stupid and mischievous, and they do not have the fortune to study." At that time, I was shocked. Why were the words previously used by landlords and rich peasants to insult the poor now being used by teachers to insult us poor and lower-middle peasants? I felt a knot in my heart. Saying that the children of poor and lower-middle peasants are stupid, from my interactions with the children of poor and lower-middle peasants, I found that they are very intelligent. Organizing them to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, perform cultural programs, they learn quickly and perform well, and are very popular among the poor and lower-middle peasants. Saying they are mischievous, in labor, they observe socialist labor discipline, with boundless enthusiasm. When delivering public grain and surplus grain, everyone rushes to the front, each one is an active builder of socialism. Why are such good youths seen as the most stupid and mischievous by some people? This knot is now untied. Originally, it was the revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev that excluded and attacked our poor and lower-middle peasant youth. It was the Chinese Khrushchev who usurped the educational power and desperately fought with the proletariat for the younger generation, attempting to cultivate successors for the restoration of capitalism. This is intolerable!

Today, our great leader Chairman Mao supports us poor and lower-middle peasants, allowing us to take control of the school leadership. We must make Chairman Mao proud. Chairman Mao pointed out in the brilliant "May 7th Directive": "The phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools can no longer continue." The broad poor and lower-middle peasants have raised the thousand-pound hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, smashed the bourgeois revisionist educational line, and seized back the rural educational power from the hands of the Chinese Khrushchev. They have broken the monopoly of the bourgeois intellectuals and become the masters of culture. Now, the school is ours. The history that was overturned has been overturned again.

I am a soldier of the People's Liberation Army of China. I will definitely follow the words of our great leader Chairman Mao, firmly support and cooperate with the poor and lower-middle peasants in managing the educational power in the countryside, and strive to cultivate a new generation of communists. I will make our socialist iron-clad mountains and rivers, red for a thousand generations and ten thousand years.

### 贫下中农管理学校就是好！

    贫下中农管理学校就是好！
    最近，我读了报上连续发表的有关贫下中农管理学校的调查报告，看到我们贫下中农掌握了学校的大权，成了农村无产阶级教育革命的主力军，坚决落实了伟大领袖毛主席“在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校”的最新指示，打心眼里感到高兴。这些调查报告写得生动鲜明，说出了广大劳动群众的心里话，贫下中农管理学校就是好！好极了！
    我们贫下中农的子女，解放前，饭都吃不上，哪能进学堂？即使老人们不吃不穿，省出点钱来供我们念书，在学校里也是受歧视受欺侮的。我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，解放了我们，使我们从政治上、经济上翻了身。但是由于中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线的统治，我们贫下中农在文化上，十几年来并没有翻过身来。
    就拿我一九六五年参加农村“四清”时看到的情况来说吧：同裕四队十二户贫下中农的子女，就有大半数青少年没上过学，少数几个上过学的，连报纸也读不下来。我问一位贫农社员为什么不让孩子们上学，她说：“学校老师嫌我们的孩子脑子笨，又淘气，没有读书的福份。”我当时听了这些话，很吃惊，为什么过去地主、富农骂我们穷人的话，如今教师也用来骂起我们贫下中农来了呢？心中结下了一个疙瘩。说贫下中农孩子脑子笨吧，从我接触的贫下中农子女来看，他们脑子非常灵活。组织他们宣传毛泽东思想，演出文艺节目，学得快，演得好，很受贫下中农的欢迎。说淘气吧，他们在劳动中遵守社会主义劳动纪律，干劲冲天。交送公粮、余粮，人人都抢在前头，个个都是社会主义建设的积极分子。为什么这样好的青年，却被有些人看成是最笨、最淘气的呢？这个疙瘩现在解开了。原来就是中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线排斥打击我们贫下中农的青少年，就是中国赫鲁晓夫篡夺了教育大权，拚命地在和无产阶级争夺青年一代，企图为他培养复辟资本主义的接班人，是可忍，孰不可忍！
    今天，伟大领袖毛主席为我们贫下中农撑腰，让我们掌管学校领导大权，我们就要为毛主席争气。毛主席在光辉的“五·七”指示中指出：“资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。”广大的贫下中农奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，砸烂了资产阶级修正主义教育路线，从中国赫鲁晓夫手里夺回了农村教育大权，打破了资产阶级知识分子独霸的一统天下，贫下中农当了文化的主人，现在学校是咱们的学校了，使颠倒了的历史又重新颠倒了过来。
    我是中国人民解放军战士，一定要听伟大领袖毛主席的话，坚决支持和配合贫下中农掌好农村的教育大权，决心为培养共产主义的新一代作出最大的努力，使我国社会主义的铁打江山，千秋万代永不变色。
