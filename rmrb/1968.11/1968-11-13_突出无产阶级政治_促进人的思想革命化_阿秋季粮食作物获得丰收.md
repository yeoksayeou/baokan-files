The broad masses of agricultural laborers in Albania, by emphasizing proletarian politics, have overcome the difficulties caused by unfavorable weather this year. After securing a bumper harvest of summer grain crops, they have now also achieved a bumper harvest of autumn grain crops. The harvesting of corn, rice, and potatoes and other autumn crops is about to be completed.

This year, the corn yield in various parts of Albania has increased to varying degrees compared to last year. The average yield of corn in the famous corn-producing region of Dibra, specifically in the Klozi Agricultural Cooperative, is 170 hundredweight per hectare. In some high-yielding corn areas of Fier and Saranda, the average yield per hectare ranges from 100 to 150 hundredweight, setting new records for corn production in these regions. Potatoes across the country and rice planted in coastal areas have also seen bumper harvests. The total potato yield in the Korça region has already surpassed the target set for the last year of the Fourth Five-Year Plan (1970). The 2,990-plus hectares of potatoes in the entire region have been harvested, with an average yield of 130 hundredweight per hectare. The state-owned Maliqi Farm in this region has an even higher yield, averaging 230 hundredweight per hectare.

The bumper harvest of autumn grain crops in Albania is primarily due to the broad masses of agricultural laborers following the guidance of the Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha, emphasizing proletarian politics, and focusing on the ideological revolution of the state and the people.

Since the beginning of this year, under the leadership of Party organizations at various levels, workers in state farms, members of agricultural cooperatives, and workers in state tractor stations have studied Party documents and Comrade Hoxha's important speeches on the ideological revolution of the state and the people. Based on raising proletarian socialist consciousness, they have extensively discussed this year's grain production plans, fought against conservative thoughts that grain production cannot be increased, and formulated specific measures to increase grain production. Through these studies, the revolutionary enthusiasm and production vigor of the broad masses of agricultural laborers have been further heightened, leading to a nationwide fervent high-yield grain movement.

This year, as soon as spring arrived, many regions in Albania experienced severe cold and drought, the likes of which had not been seen in many years. However, the broad masses of workers in state farms, members of agricultural cooperatives, and workers in state tractor stations were not deterred by these difficulties. They braved the cold to cultivate wasteland, deep plow the land, build reservoirs, dredge canals, collect organic fertilizer, transport chemical fertilizer, select high-quality seeds, practice strip sowing, and apply fertilizer to individual plants, among other tasks, laying a solid foundation for the bumper harvest of autumn grain crops. In May, many regions in Albania experienced continuous heavy rainfall, and farmers braved the rain to open canals and drain water. In June, during the peak of the summer harvest, farmers, in order to race against time for grain, worked tirelessly day and night, rushing to harvest wheat and prepare the soil for corn and potatoes. Many state farms and agricultural cooperatives in plains and hilly areas immediately plowed the land after harvesting early corn and planted late corn to make up for the unmet targets in some areas for wheat and early corn. The area planted with late corn nationwide has increased by 50 percent compared to the original plan.

Currently, the broad masses of agricultural laborers are focusing on threshing corn and rice, as well as selecting, transporting, and storing seeds for various crops. (Photo attached)

　　突出无产阶级政治  促进人的思想革命化
　　阿秋季粮食作物获得丰收
    新华社地拉那八日电　阿尔巴尼亚广大农业劳动者，突出无产阶级政治，克服了今年气候不利所造成的困难，在夺取今年夏季粮食作物丰收以后，又夺取了秋季粮食作物的丰收。现在，玉米、水稻和土豆等秋季作物的收割工作即将完毕。
    今年，阿尔巴尼亚全国各地的玉米产量都在不同程度上比去年有所增长。全国著名的玉米产区迪布拉地区的克洛西农业合作社的玉米平均每公顷可收获一百七十公担。费里和萨兰达等区的一些玉米高产地区平均每公顷收获玉米一百公担到一百五十公担，出现了这些地区玉米生产的最高纪录。全国各地的土豆和沿海地区所种的水稻也获得了丰收。科尔察区的土豆总产量已超过第四个五年计划的最后一年（一九七○年）的指标。全区所种的二千九百九十多公顷土豆现已收获完毕，平均每公顷收获一百三十公担。这个区的国营马利奇农场种的土豆，平均每公顷单位产量高达二百三十公担。
    阿尔巴尼亚秋季粮食作物的丰收，首先是由于阿尔巴尼亚广大农业劳动者遵循劳动党和霍查同志的教导，突出无产阶级政治，抓国家生活和人的思想革命化的结果。
    今年以来，在各级党组织的领导下，广大国营农场工人、农业合作社社员和国营拖拉机站工人学习了党的文件和霍查同志关于国家生活和人的思想革命化的重要讲话，在提高无产阶级的社会主义觉悟的基础上，广泛讨论了今年的粮食生产计划，同认为粮食不能再增产的保守思想进行了斗争，订出了增产粮食的具体措施。通过学习，广大农业劳动者的革命热情和生产干劲更加高涨，在全国范围内开展了一个轰轰烈烈的粮食高产运动。
    今年一开春，阿尔巴尼亚许多地区遇到了多年来罕见的严寒和干旱。但是广大国营农场工人、农业合作社社员和国营拖拉机站工人并没有被困难吓倒。他们冒着严寒，开垦荒地，深翻耕地，修建水库，疏浚渠道，收集有机肥、运输化肥，精选良种，实行条播，就株施肥等，为秋季粮食作物的丰收打下了坚实的基础。今年五月，阿尔巴尼亚许多地区又连日大雨，广大农民冒雨开渠排水。六月以后，正当夏收大忙的时候，广大农民为了同时间争粮，不怕疲劳，连日作战，抢收小麦，并为玉米和土豆松土。许多平原地区和丘陵地区的国营农场和农业合作社在收完早玉米的土地上，立即翻耕，抢种晚玉米，以弥补有些地段的小麦和早玉米未完成计划的数字。全国晚玉米播种的面积比原计划扩大了百分之五十。
    目前，广大农业劳动者正在抓紧玉米和水稻的脱粒，以及各种作物的选种、运输和保管等工作。（附图片）
