	Invite workers and peasants in, send station staff out
	Zhaodong County Production Materials Supply Station opens doors for struggle-criticism-transformation

	Now, the entire station is filled with a strong socialist management ideology. All commodity supplies are based on the convenience of workers and peasants, changing the previous five steps of procurement, inspection, warehousing, outbound, and transportation to direct allocation from the station and direct allocation from the factory.

	According to a report, the Zhaodong County Production Materials Supply Station in Heilongjiang Province has adopted the method of opening doors for struggle, criticism, and transformation. They invited workers and peasants into the station and sent their own staff to factories and villages. They closely relied on workers and poor and lower-middle peasants to launch a mass movement for a commercial revolution, implementing a combination of commercial work with industrial and agricultural work. They became commercial workers who are both industrial and agricultural workers, and were praised by the broad masses of workers and peasants as "our good logistics."

	Commercial departments must rely on workers and peasants for struggle-criticism-transformation

	Since the establishment of the revolutionary committee in January this year, the Zhaodong County Production Materials Supply Station has followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and seriously carried out struggle, criticism, and transformation. However, due to insufficient understanding of the role of workers and peasants as the main force in the commercial revolution at that time, they closed the doors and carried out struggle, criticism, and transformation by themselves. As a result, no matter how they changed, they still could not break free from the old cycle of procurement, sales, allocation, storage, and transfer in the commercial sector.

	The poor and lower-middle peasants criticized their approach of closing the doors for struggle, criticism, and transformation, saying, "You sit in the room and carry out struggle, criticism, and transformation, but you don't know our difficulties. Can you change it to the right place?" The poor and lower-middle peasants' criticism hit the nail on the head. With this question in mind, they held a study class on Mao Zedong Thought, seriously studying Chairman Mao's teachings: "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ignorant, not understanding this point, we cannot obtain even the most basic knowledge." They realized that closing the doors for struggle, criticism, and transformation, not hearing the opinions of workers and peasants, being deaf and blind, would only lead to more confusion. The struggle, criticism, and transformation in the commercial sector must go out of the office, to factories and villages, and learn from workers and poor and lower-middle peasants. Only then can they grasp what to struggle against, what to criticize, and what to transform. Only then can they use proletarian ideology to transform commerce, and workers and peasants can truly grasp the power of socialist commerce.

	Therefore, they adopted the method of inviting in and sending out. They invited more than twenty workers and poor and lower-middle peasants into the station and sent more than fifty of their own staff to more than ten factories and more than twenty production teams. Together with workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, they studied and applied Chairman Mao's proletarian commercial work line, thoroughly criticized and exposed the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist commercial line of "profit-first" and "selling money first." Broad revolutionary workers and poor and lower-middle peasants all helped them expose and criticize the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist commercial line based on their own experiences.

	A poor peasant from Chengwu Commune's Minzhu Production Team said, "A watch costs more than two hundred yuan, we peasants don't care about it. A rubber tire valve core costs only a few fen, but if you can't buy it, the car can't turn, and it will affect production. But when we go to buy a valve core, some clerks don't even bother to answer, this is putting money first and not people, such a commercial door is not open for us poor and lower-middle peasants." The staff of the production materials station deeply felt that the revisionist commercial line closed people in the room, selling commodities all day, issuing invoices, and calculating, detached from workers and peasants, not understanding workers and peasants, lacking the thoughts and feelings of workers and peasants, unable to speak with workers and peasants, and unable to work together with workers and peasants. This road is very dangerous.

	Establishing a new commercial system for serving workers and peasants

	The revolutionary committee of Zhaodong County Production Materials Supply Station, following Chairman Mao's instruction "Since we are to serve the people, we must learn from the people," divided the current fifty-one staff members, who went from the family door to the school door and then to the commercial door, into batches to go to factories and villages to participate in production labor. They worked, ate, lived, and studied with workers and poor and lower-middle peasants for three months each year, familiarizing themselves with workers and peasants, understanding workers and peasants, implementing a combination of commercial work with industrial and agricultural work, and becoming commercial workers who are both industrial and agricultural workers. Ten staff members who came from workers and peasants to the commercial sector go to factories and villages to work for one month each year, not detaching from production labor, so that they can always maintain their worker and peasant nature and serve workers and peasants wholeheartedly. Now, twelve salespersons, warehouse keepers, and administrative management personnel have gone to factories and villages to participate in production labor.

	They also, based on the opinions of workers and peasants, followed the bright path of Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive," organizing revolutionary cadres and staff to go to workers and peasants, participate in the three great revolutionary struggles, and rely on workers and peasants to carry out struggle, criticism, and transformation in their own departments. After four salespersons, including Wang Shaohua, went to Changwu Commune's Jin'an Production Team, they reformed the unreasonable system of scattered commodity collection, cumbersome procedures, and time-consuming processes according to the opinions of poor and lower-middle peasants. In the past, peasants had to stay overnight in the city to buy fertilizer, but now they can return to their production teams on the same day, which is very popular among the peasants. Now, all commodity supplies in the entire station are based on the convenience of workers and peasants, changing the previous five steps of procurement, inspection, warehousing, outbound, and transportation to direct allocation from the station and direct allocation from the factory, reducing the three steps of procurement, outbound, and warehousing.

	New changes, new atmosphere

	Due to relying on workers and peasants for struggle, criticism, and transformation, Zhaodong County Production Materials Supply Station has initially achieved some results and shown new changes and a new atmosphere.

	Now, all revolutionary staff in the station actively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, and the socialist management ideology is flourishing. In the practice of class struggle and production struggle, they have established deep class feelings with workers and poor and lower-middle peasants. They have achieved the goal of thinking what workers and peasants think, urgently addressing what workers and peasants urgently need, and helping workers and peasants with what they need. The second production team of Songzhan Commune's Songzhan Production Team had a broken rubber tire valve core, and it was not available for purchase at the time. They came to the production materials supply station, and this commodity had not been operated for several years, but considering the need for production, they sent a special person to the factory to purchase the valve core, ensuring the need for production. Large water bags used for irrigation had been emphasized for several years to be managed by the relevant department and were not willing to be operated, pushing them out. This spring and summer, Zhaodong experienced a severe drought, and peasants needed anti-drought tools. They sent special personnel to purchase large water bags, meeting the needs of the peasants.

	Through participating in industrial and agricultural production labor, they became familiar with industrial and agricultural production, learning the common knowledge of using agricultural tools and fertilizers, and better serving industrial and agricultural production. Now, 30% of the staff basically can install, use, and repair the commodities they operate themselves. When the vegetable field of Minzhu Production Team of Zhaodong Town Commune had insect pests, the peasants called the production materials supply station and asked for the "doctor of crops." They immediately sent people to use pesticides to eliminate the pests, making the cabbages grow vigorously, and quickly promoted the method of using pesticides to eliminate pests to the entire county. To do a good job in the supply and use of fertilizers, the staff worked with poor and lower-middle peasants, summarized the experience of using fertilizers in different soil types in various regions of the county, and then went deep into the twenty-five communes and various production teams in the entire county to guide the use of fertilizers, using the limited fertilizers to the fullest, and fully playing the role of fertilizers.

### 肇东县生产资料供应站开门进行斗批改

    请工农群众进来　派本站职工出去
    肇东县生产资料供应站开门进行斗批改
    现在，全站社会主义经营思想蔚然成风，所有商品供应都从方便工农群众出发，把过去进货、验收、入库、出库、运输五个环节改为就站直拨，就厂直拨
    本报讯　黑龙江省肇东县生产资料供应站，采取开门搞斗、批、改的办法，把工农群众请进来，把自己的职工派到工厂、农村去，紧紧依靠工人和贫下中农，开展一场商业革命的群众运动，实行同工农结合，成为亦工亦农的商业工作人员，被广大工农群众誉为我们的“好后勤”。
    商业部门斗批改必须依靠工农群众
    肇东县生产资料供应站，自今年一月革命委员会建立后，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，认真开展斗、批、改。但是由于当时对工农群众在开展商业革命中的主力军的作用认识不足，他们就自己关起门来搞，结果改来改去，还是没有跳出商业部门购、销、调、存、转的旧圈子。
    贫下中农对他们关起门来搞斗、批、改的作法提出批评说：“你们坐在屋里搞斗、批、改，我们的难处你们不晓得，能改到正地方吗？”贫下中农一针见血的批评，击中要害。他们带着这个问题，举办毛泽东思想学习班，认真学习毛主席的教导：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”认识到关门搞斗、批、改，听不到工农群众意见，耳聋眼瞎，会越改越糊涂。商业部门的斗、批、改必须走出办公室，到工厂、农村去，拜工人和贫下中农为师，才能抓住斗什么，批什么，改什么，才能用无产阶级思想改造商业，工农群众才能掌好社会主义商业的大权。
    于是，他们采取请进来、派出去的办法，把工农群众请到站里，把自己的职工派到工厂、农村去，充分依靠工人阶级和贫下中农搞好斗、批、改。从今年初开始，他们请进二十多人次工人和贫下中农到站里来，派出职工五十多人次，到十几个工厂和二十多个生产队，同工人和贫下中农一起，大学大用毛主席的无产阶级商业工作路线，大揭大批中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义商业路线。广大革命工人和贫下中农都以自己切身经历，帮助他们揭发、批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“利润挂帅”、“卖钱第一”的修正主义商业路线的罪恶。
    肇东镇公社民主大队一位老贫农说：“一块手表二百来元，我们农民不稀罕它，一个胶皮车气门芯，才几分钱，买不到车就不能转，就要影响生产。可是我们去买气门芯有的营业员都怠答不理，这就是认钱不认人，这样的商业大门就不是为我们贫下中农开的。”生产资料站的同志们深有感触地说：修正主义商业路线，把人关在屋子里，整天卖商品，开发票，打算盘，脱离工农，不了解工农，缺乏工农思想感情，和工农话说不到一起，事做不到一块，这条路是十分危险的。
    创建为工农群众服务的新的商业体制
    肇东县生产资料供应站革命委员会遵照毛主席“既然要为工农群众服务，那就首先必须懂得工人农民，熟悉他们的生活、工作和思想”的教导，将现在五十一名由家门到学校门又到商业门的营业员、保管员、采买员、加工员、财会人员分期分批轮流到工厂、农村参加生产劳动，每年劳动三个月，同工人和贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习，熟悉工农群众，了解工农群众，实行同工农结合，成为亦工亦农的商业工作者。十名从工农群众来到商业部门的工作人员，每年到工厂和农村劳动一个月，不脱离生产劳动，使他们永远保持工农本色，全心全意为工农群众服务。现在已有十二名营业员、保管员和行政管理人员去工厂、农村，参加生产劳动。
    他们还根据工农群众的意见，走毛主席“五·七”指示的光辉道路，组织革命干部和职工，到工农群众中去，参加三大革命斗争，依靠工农群众搞好本部门的斗、批、改。营业员王绍华等四人到昌五公社金安大队后，根据贫下中农意见，改革了取货交款分散、手续繁琐、耽误时间等不合理制度。过去社员到街里买化肥得住一宿，现在当天就可以回到生产队，很受社员欢迎。现在全站所有商品供应，都从方便工农群众出发，把过去进货、验收、入库、出库、运输五个环节，改为就站直拨，就厂直拨，减少进货、出库、入库三个环节。
    新变化，新气象
    肇东县生产资料供应站，由于依靠工农群众搞斗批改，已初步取得一些成绩，出现了新变化，新气象。
    现在全站革命职工活学活用毛泽东思想，社会主义经营思想蔚然成风。他们在阶级斗争、生产斗争实践中，同工人和贫下中农建立了深厚的阶级感情。做到了想工农之所想，急工农之所急，帮工农之所需。宋站公社宋站大队第二生产队胶皮车胡芦头坏了，一时买不到，就来到生产资料供应站，这个商品几年来就没经营，但想到生产需要，就派专人到工厂联系，买到了胡芦头，保证了生产需要。浇地用的大水口袋，几年来都强调归口，不愿经营，往外推。今年春夏两季肇东大旱，社员需要抗旱工具，他们就派专人采购大水口袋，满足社员需要。
    在参加工农业生产劳动中，熟悉工农业生产，使他们学会农具、化肥等生产资料使用常识，更好为工农业生产服务。现在百分之三十的职工，基本做到自己经营的商品，会安装，会使用，会修理。肇东镇公社民主大队菜地长了虫子，社员就给生产资料供应站挂电话，请“庄稼大夫”，他们立即去人用农药把害虫消灭，使白菜茁壮生长，并把使用农药消灭害虫的方法很快推广到全县。为了搞好化肥供应和使用，职工们同贫下中农一起劳动，总结全县各地区不同土质使用化肥的经验后，就分别深入全县二十五个公社各生产队指导使用化肥，把有限的化肥用在刀刃上，充分发挥了化肥的作用。
