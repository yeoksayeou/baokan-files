Ten thousand workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, and Red Guards from Changsha City and Changsha County held a grand celebration in front of the memorial hall. They resolved to take Comrade Lei Feng as their model, to love Chairman Mao, to believe in Chairman Mao, to admire Chairman Mao, and to be loyal to Chairman Mao.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, November 20th - The "Chairman Mao's Good Soldier Lei Feng Memorial Hall" was successfully completed today in Lei Feng's hometown - Leifeng People's Commune, Leifeng Production Brigade, Changsha County, Hunan Province. Ten thousand workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, and Red Guards from Changsha City and Changsha County held a grand celebration in front of the memorial hall today.

The construction of the Lei Feng Memorial Hall was a process of intense struggle between two classes, two lines, and two paths. In 1963, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao issued the great call to "Learn from Comrade Lei Feng." Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, called for "all soldiers in the army to learn from Comrade Lei Feng's example and become Chairman Mao's good soldiers." The entire army and the nation launched an unprecedented movement to learn from Comrade Lei Feng's example and actively apply Chairman Mao's works. However, the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, along with his agents in Hunan and Changsha, were terrified and enraged by the nation's military and civilians learning from Comrade Lei Feng and applying Chairman Mao's works. They used various means to sabotage the effort. In the construction of the Lei Feng Memorial Hall, they restricted funds, scale, manpower, materials, transportation, and content, and resisted the effort. After the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and Red Guards angrily exposed and criticized the heinous crimes committed by Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Hunan and Changsha. With the support of the People's Liberation Army, the revolutionary masses of Lei Feng's hometown launched the construction of the Lei Feng Memorial Hall. After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committees of Hunan Province, Changsha City, and Changsha County, they paid great attention to the construction of the memorial hall. The leaders of the provincial and municipal Revolutionary Committees and the leaders of the Hunan garrison all personally directed the construction of the memorial hall.

Upon entering the "Chairman Mao's Good Soldier Lei Feng Memorial Hall," one first sees the full-body statue of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, as well as a large photo of Chairman Mao with his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin. The hall is divided into four sections: "Class Bitterness, National Hatred," which recounts Lei Feng's bitter childhood; "Growing Up Under the Nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought," which recounts how Lei Feng, under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, became a reliable successor to the cause of the proletarian revolution in the great storms of class struggle; "Chairman Mao's Good Soldier - Lei Feng," which recounts how Lei Feng, in the great school of Mao Zedong Thought that is the People's Liberation Army, became a soldier who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao; and "Learning from Comrade Lei Feng," which recounts how the military and civilians across the nation actively responded to Chairman Mao's great call and launched a movement to learn from Comrade Lei Feng.

The celebration was held in front of the Lei Feng Memorial Hall. Comrade Li Yuan, the head of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, spoke on behalf of the provincial and municipal Revolutionary Committees. He said, "Comrade Lei Feng's life was a life that shone with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought and is forever worth learning from. We should take Comrade Lei Feng as our model, love Chairman Mao infinitely, believe in Chairman Mao infinitely, admire Chairman Mao infinitely, and be loyal to Chairman Mao infinitely. We must resolutely implement the set of principles and methods for studying Chairman Mao's works proposed by Vice Chairman Lin, carry forward the revolutionary academic style of combining theory with practice advocated by Chairman Mao, and continuously push the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to new heights and new levels."

Comrade Wei Kaijiang, a responsible comrade of the People's Liberation Army in Hunan Province, said in his speech that we must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings, forever "learn from Comrade Lei Feng," hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and, together with the revolutionary people of the entire province of Hunan, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to completion.

Representatives from the Changsha City Workers' Congress, Farmers' Congress, Red Guards' Congress, and poor and lower-middle peasants from Lei Feng's hometown also spoke at the meeting. Comrade Fu Huaxian, a representative of the People's Liberation Army Shenyang Garrison who came specially from Shenyang to attend the meeting, read a congratulatory telegram from the Shenyang Garrison at the meeting. Lei Feng's former deputy platoon leader, He Shaoyong, and a representative from Anshan Chemical Industry General Plant also spoke at the meeting.

Representatives from the poor and lower-middle peasants of Shaoshan Commune, where the red sun rises, Comrade Ou Yanghai's former platoon leader, Ou Yanghu, and Lei Feng's relatives also attended the meeting.

    “毛主席的好战士雷锋纪念馆”建成
    长沙市和长沙县工人、贫下中农、解放军指战员和红卫兵小将一万人，在纪念馆前举行了隆重庆祝大会。他们决心以雷锋同志为榜样，对毛主席无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，无限忠诚
    新华社长沙二十日电　“毛主席的好战士雷锋纪念馆”今天在雷锋同志的家乡——湖南省长沙县雷锋人民公社雷锋大队胜利建成。长沙市和长沙县工人、贫下中农、解放军指战员与红卫兵小将一万人，今天在纪念馆前举行了隆重的庆祝大会。
    雷锋纪念馆的建设过程，贯串着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的剧烈斗争。一九六三年，我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席发出了“向雷锋同志学习”的伟大号召，毛主席的亲密战友林彪副主席号召“全军同志都应当学习雷锋同志的榜样做毛主席的好战士”，全军、全国蓬勃兴起了一个空前规模的以雷锋同志为榜样，活学活用毛主席著作的伟大群众运动。可是，以叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇为首的党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在湖南、长沙的代理人，对全国军民向雷锋同志学习，象雷锋那样活学活用毛主席著作，怕得要死，恨得要命，他们采取各种手段进行破坏。在雷锋纪念馆的建设上，他们卡经费、卡规模、卡人力、卡物资、卡运输、卡内容，进行抵制。无产阶级文化大革命开始以后，广大工农兵和红卫兵小将，愤怒揭发和批判了刘少奇及其在湖南、长沙的代理人所犯下的滔天罪行。雷锋家乡的广大革命群众，在中国人民解放军的支持下开展了雷锋纪念馆的筹建工作。湖南省、长沙市和长沙县革命委员会成立后，对纪念馆的建设非常重视，省、市革命委员会的负责人和湖南驻军负责人都先后亲自到雷锋大队指导纪念馆的建设。
    走进“毛主席的好战士雷锋纪念馆”，首先看到的是我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的全身塑像，以及毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席在一起的大型照片。馆里分四部分：阶级苦，民族恨，记述雷锋同志苦难的童年；在毛泽东思想哺育下成长，记述雷锋同志在毛泽东思想哺育下，在阶级斗争大风大浪中锻炼成为无产阶级革命事业最可靠的接班人；毛主席的好战士——雷锋，记述在中国人民解放军这所毛泽东思想大学校里，雷锋同志锻炼成为无限忠于毛主席的好战士；向雷锋同志学习，记述全国军民积极响应毛主席的伟大号召，掀起向雷锋同志学习的群众运动。
    庆祝大会在雷锋纪念馆前举行。省革命委员会主任黎原同志代表省、市革命委员会在大会上讲话。他说，雷锋同志的一生，是闪烁着毛泽东思想光辉的一生，永远值得我们学习。我们要以雷锋同志为榜样，对毛主席无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，无限忠诚。我们要坚决贯彻林副主席提出的一整套学习毛主席著作的方针、原则和方法，发扬毛主席亲自倡导的理论联系实际的革命学风，不断把活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动推向新的高潮，提高到新的水平。
    人民解放军驻湖南省部队负责人魏凯江同志在讲话中表示，一定要牢记毛主席的教导，永远“向雷锋同志学习”，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席一系列最新指示，同湖南全省革命人民一道，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    长沙市工代会、农代会、红代会和雷锋同志家乡的贫下中农代表等也在大会上讲了话。由沈阳专程赶来参加大会的人民解放军沈阳部队代表符华先同志，在会上宣读了沈阳部队祝贺雷锋纪念馆落成的贺电。雷锋生前所在班副班长何绍勇和鞍钢化工总厂的代表也在会上讲了话。
    来自红太阳升起的地方——韶山公社的贫下中农代表，欧阳海生前所在班班长欧阳湖，以及雷锋同志的亲属等参加了大会。
