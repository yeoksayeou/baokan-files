New Delhi, Oct. 1 (New China News Agency) -- The Indian monthly "Liberation" published an article in its October issue, enthusiastically congratulating the Chinese people on their splendid victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao.

The article says: "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese revolution has advanced from one epoch-making victory to another. After completing the new democratic revolution, the Chinese revolution has entered the socialist stage." The article points out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao is a great revolution in ideology and culture, and fundamentally, a great political revolution. "This revolution has shattered the imperialists' and revisionists' dream of restoring capitalism in China."

The article says: "Chairman Mao Tse-tung has not only taught us how to carry out revolution in colonial, semi-colonial and other countries, not only solved the problem of transition from new democracy to socialism, but also solved the problem of carrying out revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat to prevent the restoration of capitalism. The world has entered a new era, the era of Mao Tse-tung's thought."

The article says: "Today, one's attitude towards China, towards Mao Tse-tung's thought, is the touchstone of a Communist, a revolutionary. Whoever opposes China, whoever opposes the Communist Party of China, whoever opposes Mao Tse-tung's thought, is a contemptible accomplice of the counter-revolutionaries. There is no middle road between the revolutionary camp and the counter-revolutionary camp."

The article exposes and condemns the Dange renegade clique and the Indian Communist revisionists for vigorously advocating the "parliamentary road." The article says, whenever the Indian people rise up to fight against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic comprador capital, the Indian reactionaries and the foreign imperialists, including the Soviet revisionists, within the Indian working-class movement, these cunning agents, launch a campaign of slander and vilification against China. This is what their masters want; their masters want them to do their utmost to isolate the Indian people from the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world.

The article says, now the Indian people have finally cast off these swindlers -- the lackeys of the imperialists, the Soviet revisionists, and the Indian reactionaries. The armed struggle of peasants led by the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India has broken out in some parts of India. The Indian peasants, who suffer from extremely severe exploitation, have rejected the "parliamentary road" and are advancing, fighting against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic comprador capital. The article says: "Only by learning from Chairman Mao and the masses can the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party fulfill the glorious task entrusted to them by history."

The article concludes by saying that the victory of the Chinese revolution has inspired the people of the world, igniting their new enthusiasm and courage to strike and destroy all reactionary things and build new and great glorious things. The article points out that the forces of world revolution are growing stronger every day. The day of the complete failure of imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries is not far off.

    印度《解放》月刊热情欢呼我国文化大革命的辉煌胜利
    中国人民在伟大的领袖毛主席领导下
    从一个划时代胜利走向又一划时代胜利
    中国革命的胜利鼓舞世界人民斗争　帝修反彻底失败的日子已经不远
    新华社一日讯　新德里消息：印度《解放》月刊在十月份出版的一期上刊登了一篇文章，热烈祝贺中国人民在伟大领袖毛主席领导下，进行无产阶级文化大革命，取得辉煌胜利。
    文章说：“在毛主席领导下，中国革命从一个划时代的胜利走向又一个划时代的胜利。在完成了新民主主义革命之后，中国革命过渡到社会主义阶段。”文章指出，在毛主席领导下开展的无产阶级文化大革命，是一场思想大革命和文化大革命，而从根本上说，是一场政治大革命。“这场革命打破了帝国主义者和修正主义者在中国复辟资本主义的美梦。”
    文章说：“毛泽东主席不仅教导我们在殖民地、半殖民地和其它国家如何进行革命，不仅解决了从新民主主义过渡到社会主义的问题，而且也解决了在无产阶级专政下进行革命以防止资本主义复辟的问题。世界已经进入一个新时代，即毛泽东思想的时代。”
    文章说：“今天，对中国的态度，对毛泽东思想的态度，是对一个共产党人、一个革命者的试金石。谁反对中国、谁反对中国共产党、谁反对毛泽东思想，谁就是反革命派的可鄙的同伙。在革命阵营和反革命阵营之间没有中间道路可走。”
    文章揭露和谴责了丹吉叛徒集团和印共修正主义分子极力鼓吹“议会道路”。文章说，每当印度人民起来进行反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚买办资本的斗争的时候，印度反动派和包括苏修在内的外国帝国主义者在印度工人阶级运动内部的这些狡猾的代理人，便对中国进行一场造谣污蔑的运动。这是他们的主子的需要，他们的主子就是要他们竭力把印度人民同中国人民和世界革命人民隔离开来。
    文章说，现在，印度人民终于抛弃了这些骗子——帝国主义者的、苏修的和印度反动派的走狗。印度共产党革命派领导下的农民武装斗争在印度的一些地区爆发了。遭受极端严重的剥削的印度农民拒绝了“议会道路”，正在前进，同帝国主义、封建主义、官僚买办资本战斗。文章说：“只有向毛主席和群众学习，共产党革命派才能完成历史赋予他们的光荣任务。”
    文章最后说，中国革命取得的胜利鼓舞了世界人民，激发了他们的新的热情和勇气，去打击和摧毁一切反动的东西，建立起新的伟大和光荣的事物。文章指出，世界革命力量一天天发展壮大。帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动派彻底失败的日子已经不远了。
