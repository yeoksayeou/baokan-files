The suburban counties of Shanghai have completed the state's cotton procurement plan ahead of schedule. The broad masses of people's commune members in the suburbs of Shanghai, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "grasp cotton production tightly," have been vigorously promoting revolution and production. This has led to a significant increase in the output of lint cotton compared to last year's bumper harvest. They have been selling new cotton to the state as they harvest it. By the end of October, the amount of lint cotton procured by each county had exceeded last year's total annual procurement by 2%, thus completing the state's procurement plan ahead of schedule. Currently, the newly processed cotton is being continuously transported to textile mills.

Since the new cotton has been harvested, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, with hearts full of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, have been carrying large portraits of Chairman Mao, holding up red flags, and beating drums as they deliver their best cotton to the procurement stations, selling "loyalty cotton" to the state. The staff at the procurement stations have also been studying Chairman Mao's works together with the poor and lower-middle peasants who come to sell cotton, holding study sessions and engaging in revolutionary criticism. Some procurement stations have even organized small teams to go to the communes and production brigades to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, explain the cotton procurement policy, work and study with the commune members, and discuss the excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, thereby fundamentally changing the previous simple buying and selling relationship between the procurement stations and the commune members.

This year, in the cotton procurement work in the suburbs of Shanghai, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have been widely relied upon, and the mass line has been thoroughly implemented. The supply and marketing departments have universally promoted the method of credit sales, where production teams themselves sample, weigh, and pack the cotton, and then send it to the procurement stations for inspection. This has greatly enhanced the poor and lower-middle peasants' sense of responsibility as masters of their own affairs and has also reduced the time farmers have to wait to sell their cotton, saving manpower. The poor and lower-middle peasants excitedly said, "Chairman Mao trusts us poor and lower-middle peasants so much. We must grow good cotton, harvest good cotton, and sell good cotton."

Now, under the inspiration of the communiqué of the enlarged 12th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Party, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the suburbs of Shanghai are urgently attending to the late-stage management of their cotton fields, striving to produce more cotton, and make greater contributions to the socialist construction of the motherland.

    上海郊区各县提前完成棉花收购计划
    上海郊区广大人民公社社员遵循伟大领袖毛主席“必须把棉花抓紧”的教导，狠抓革命，猛促生产，使全郊区皮棉产量比大丰收的去年有了大幅度的增长。他们边采摘边向国家交售新棉，到十月底，各县收购的皮棉，已超过去年全年收购总数的百分之二，提前完成了国家收购计划。目前，经过加工的新棉正源源不断地调往纺织厂。
    新棉登场以来，广大贫下中农怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的一片忠心，抬着毛主席的巨幅画像，高举红旗，敲锣打鼓，把最好的棉花送到收购站，向国家交售“忠”字棉。收购站的工作人员还和前来交售棉花的贫下中农一起学毛主席著作，一起开讲用会，一起搞革命大批判。有的收购站还组织小分队下社、队宣传毛泽东思想，宣传棉花收购政策，与社员同劳动，同学习，大讲文化大革命的大好形势，彻底改变了过去收购站与社员的单纯买卖关系。
    上海郊区今年在棉花收购工作中，广泛依靠贫下中农，大走群众路线。供销部门普遍地推行由生产队自己检样、自己过磅、自己打包、送收购站检验的信用交售方法，大大激发了贫下中农当家作主的责任感，也减少了农民交售棉花的等候时间，节约了人力。贫下中农激动地说，毛主席这样信任我们贫下中农，我们一定要种好棉，收好棉，售好棉。
    现在，上海郊区广大贫下中农在党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的鼓舞下，正抓紧棉田后期管理，争取生产更多的棉花，为祖国社会主义建设作出更大的贡献。（据新华社讯）
