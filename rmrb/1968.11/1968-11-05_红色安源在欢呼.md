The bulletin of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Twelfth Central Committee of the Party, transmitted through red radio waves, reached the great leader Mao Zedong's personally initiated birthplace of the workers' movement—Red Anshun.

Anshun Mountain is boiling! From the workshops to the mine shafts, from the dormitories to the streets, above and below the mine, crowds cheering the publication of the bulletin flow endlessly. In an instant, the streets and alleys were plastered with large banners cheering the bulletin. Letters of resolve and messages of joy, responding enthusiastically to the great battle call of the plenary session's bulletin, flew to the revolutionary committee like snowflakes. The miners of Anshun cheer loudly: "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

The miners of Anshun, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, harbor deep hatred for the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi. As early as the 1920s, they had directly suffered from Liu Shaoqi's cruel persecution. After liberation, this great ambitious man, for the needs of his counter-revolutionary plot to usurp the Party, the government, and the military, shamelessly distorted history, stole credit from heaven, and attempted to turn Anshun into a base for him to gain political capital and restore capitalism. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the miners of Anshun responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "Bombard the Headquarters" and launched a fierce attack on Liu Shaoqi and his agents, smashing their counter-revolutionary plot. Now, as the miners of Anshun study the bulletin of the plenary session, they recall their battle journey and say excitedly: "The Eighth Plenary Session of the Twelfth Central Committee unanimously passed a resolution to expel Liu Shaoqi from the Party permanently and revoke all his positions within and outside the Party. We firmly support this!"

Under the inspiration of the bulletin of the plenary session, the battlefields to criticize Liu Shaoqi are set up everywhere on Anshun Mountain. People point out that the revolutionary flames of the Anshun Great Strike were personally ignited by Chairman Mao, and the victory of the strike was the victory of the great Mao Zedong Thought. Liu Shaoqi's attempt to erase Chairman Mao's great achievements is absolutely impossible. Sweeping the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi into the dustbin of history is truly a great relief!

The old workers who participated in the Anshun Great Strike know best the ugly face of the scoundrel Liu Shaoqi. On the evening of November 1, they gathered around the radio, listening over and over again to the bulletin of the plenary session. Xu Shengyuan, an old worker over seventy, personally witnessed Liu Shaoqi's shameful behavior of colluding with foreign devils and capitalists in Anshun in those days. Now, after studying the bulletin, he is even more filled with boundless hatred for the scoundrel Liu Shaoqi. Based on his memories, he asked someone to write a list of charges titled "The Ugly Face of the Scoundrel Liu Shaoqi." He said: Liu Shaoqi is a close brother of the capitalists. During the strike, he and the capitalists wore the same pants, breathed through the same nostril. He is a great scoundrel who betrayed the interests of the workers of Anshun and sabotaged the workers' movement in Anshun. Today, the scoundrel Liu Shaoqi has been swept into the dustbin of history, which is excellent!

In front of the martyrs' tombs who were betrayed by Liu Shaoqi and sacrificed, the old workers exposed the heinous crimes of the scoundrel Liu Shaoqi. It was this Liu Shaoqi who betrayed the workers of Anshun, allowing the enemy to suddenly surround the workers' club in September 1925, shooting and injuring more than thirty workers, and arresting more than seventy people, causing the infamous "September Massacre." The old workers' exposure aroused the people's boundless hatred for Liu Shaoqi. People angrily shouted: "Down with the scoundrel Liu Shaoqi!"

The miners of Anshun, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are determined to respond to the great battle call proposed by the plenary session, continue to deeply carry out the revolutionary criticism, and thoroughly eliminate the reactionary revisionist thoughts of Liu Shaoqi and other top cliques of capitalist roaders within the Party. The miners say: We are Chairman Mao's good miners. The battle orders issued by the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin are firmly executed by us. We closely follow Chairman Mao, and victory will always be ours!

    红色安源在欢呼
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报，通过红色的电波，传到了伟大领袖毛主席亲手开创的工人运动策源地——红色安源。
    安源山在沸腾！从工房到井口，从宿舍到街头，井上井下，欢呼公报发表的人群川流不息。顷刻间，街头巷尾贴满了欢呼公报的大幅标语。热烈响应全会公报伟大战斗号召的决心书、报喜信，象雪片似地飞到革命委员会。安源矿工热烈欢呼：“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！”“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    无限忠于毛主席的安源矿工，对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇有着刻骨的仇恨。早在二十年代，他们就直接遭受过刘少奇的残酷迫害。解放以后，刘少奇这个大野心家为他篡党、篡政、篡军的反革命阴谋的需要，无耻地颠倒历史，贪天功为己有，妄图把安源变成他捞取政治资本、复辟资本主义的阵地。无产阶级文化大革命中，安源矿工响应毛主席《炮打司令部》的伟大号召，向刘少奇及其代理人发起了猛烈进攻，粉碎了他们的反革命阴谋。如今，安源矿工在学习全会公报时，回顾了战斗历程，激动地说：“党的八届扩大的十二中全会一致通过决议，把刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外的一切职务，我们坚决拥护！”
    在全会公报的鼓舞下，安源山上，到处摆开了批判刘少奇的战场。人们指出，安源大罢工的革命烈火是毛主席亲手点燃的，大罢工的胜利是伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利。刘少奇妄想抹煞毛主席的丰功伟绩，这绝对办不到。把刘少奇这个叛徒、内奸、工贼扫进历史的垃圾堆，真是大快人心！
    参加过当年安源大罢工的老工人，对刘少奇这个工贼的丑恶嘴脸最清楚。十一月一日晚，他们围坐在收音机旁，一遍又一遍地收听全会公报。七十多岁的老工人徐胜远，亲眼见过刘少奇当年在安源和那些洋鬼子、资本家勾勾搭搭，出卖工人的丑态，如今学了公报，更加激起他对刘少奇这个工贼的无比仇恨。他根据自己的回忆，请人写了一份《刘少奇工贼嘴脸》的罪状。他说：刘少奇跟资本家是亲兄弟。在大罢工中，他和资本家穿的是连裆裤，一个鼻孔喘气。他是出卖安源工人利益、破坏安源工人运动的大工贼。今天，刘少奇这个工贼被扫进了历史垃圾堆，真是好极了！
    在被刘少奇出卖而牺牲的烈士墓前，老工人揭露了工贼刘少奇的累累罪行。就是这个刘少奇，出卖了安源工人，使敌人在一九二五年九月，突然包围工人俱乐部，开枪打死、打伤三十多个工人，七十多人被捕，造成了闻名的“九月惨案”。老工人的揭露，激起了群众对刘少奇的无比仇恨。人们愤怒地高呼：“打倒工贼刘少奇！”
    经历了无产阶级文化大革命锤炼的安源矿工决心响应全会提出的伟大战斗号召，继续深入展开革命大批判，彻底肃清刘少奇等党内最大的一小撮走资派的反革命修正主义的思想。矿工们说：我们是毛主席的好矿工。以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部发出的战斗号令，我们坚决执行。我们紧紧跟着毛主席，胜利永远属于我们！
