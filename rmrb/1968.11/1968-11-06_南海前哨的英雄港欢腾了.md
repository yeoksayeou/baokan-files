The heroic port on the frontline of the South China Sea, Wushi in the Beibu Gulf, was filled with joy on the evening of November 1. The news of the publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party spread throughout the port, and the entire area erupted in celebration. People waved red flags, carried portraits of Chairman Mao, brandished red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," beat drums and gongs, and flooded the streets, enthusiastically cheering the publication of the communiqué, celebrating the great victory of the Cultural Revolution, and celebrating the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! Shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long, long live Chairman Mao!" and "Wishing Chairman Mao a long life!" echoed across the night sky of the Beibu Gulf.

Leading the procession were the heroes of the anti-American struggle—the militia camp of the Wushi Fishery Brigade. The militiamen marched forward with determination and vigor, repeatedly raising their fists and shouting, "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Down with the reactionary Kuomintang!" "Down with the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi!"

The heroic militiamen held an all-night meeting to study the communiqué and recall their battle experiences: After liberation, the militiamen fought against landlords, struggled against fishery tyrants, eliminated remnants of bandits, and crossed the Qiongzhou Strait to help the People's Liberation Army liberate Hainan Island, earning immortal merits for the people! However, the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices, in order to realize their evil plot to restore capitalism, opposed the policy of universal military training and attempted to dismantle the militia. At this critical moment, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the great call to "establish militia regiments." Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the militiamen displayed revolutionary heroism and engaged in hundreds of head-on struggles with the vicious enemies of the people of the world—American imperialism—in the Beibu Gulf, achieving one victory after another and repeatedly exposing the paper tiger nature of American imperialism. The heroic militiamen deeply felt from their own battle experiences that following Chairman Mao means victory! Huang Dacong, a model in studying Chairman Mao's works, a member of the Revolutionary Committee of Zhanjiang District, and deputy commander of the militia camp of the Wushi Fishery Brigade, said: We must follow the great leader Chairman Mao and march forward bravely, achieve comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, and remain highly vigilant, strengthen militia work, and strengthen preparedness. We will turn the frontline of the South China Sea into an iron fortress. If the enemy dares to invade, we will decisively, thoroughly, completely, and utterly annihilate them.

The militiamen fishing in the Beibu Gulf, upon hearing the news of the publication of the communiqué, stood on the deck, facing the waves, and looked towards the north, their hearts filled with emotions. Zhang Daimei, a third-class merit awardee in the anti-American struggle and a female militiaman, said: We must implement the great battle call of the plenary session with practical actions and carry the Cultural Revolution to the end.

    南海前哨的英雄港欢腾了
    十一月一日晚，党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表的喜讯传到了南海前哨北部湾的英雄港——乌石。全港顿时一片欢腾。人们高举红旗，抬着毛主席画像，挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，敲锣打鼓，涌上街头，热烈欢呼公报发表，欢呼无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，欢呼毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！”的欢呼声震荡着北部湾的夜空。
    走在游行队伍最前列的是反美斗争的英雄集体——乌石渔业大队民兵营。民兵们雄赳赳，气昂昂，阔步前进。他们不断振臂高呼：“打倒美帝！”“打倒苏修！”“打倒国民党反动派！”“打倒叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇！”
    英雄的民兵们连夜召开座谈会，结合学习公报，回忆了自己的战斗经历：解放以后，民兵们打土豪、斗渔霸、剿残匪、横渡琼州海峡，配合人民解放军解放了海南岛，为人民立下了不朽的功勋！可是，叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其同伙，为了实现其复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋，反对全民皆兵，妄想砍掉民兵。在这个关键时刻，我们的伟大统帅毛主席，发出了“大办民兵师”的伟大号召。民兵们在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，发扬革命英雄主义精神，在北部湾上同世界人民的凶恶敌人——美帝国主义，进行了几百次针锋相对的斗争，取得了一次又一次的胜利，使美帝国主义一次又一次地现出了纸老虎的原形。英雄的民兵们，从亲身的战斗经历中，深刻体会到：紧跟毛主席就是胜利！学习毛主席著作积极分子、湛江专区革命委员会常委、乌石港渔业大队民兵营副营长黄大聪说：我们一定紧跟伟大领袖毛主席奋勇前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，并百倍提高警惕，加强民兵工作，加强战备，把南海前哨筑成铜墙铁壁，如果敌人胆敢来犯，我们就坚决、彻底、干净、全部地把他们消灭掉。
    正在北部湾海上捕鱼的民兵们，听到公报发表的喜讯以后，站在船头，迎着波涛，仰望着北方，心情久久不能平静。反美斗争三等功臣、女民兵张带妹说：我们一定要用实际行动来落实全会提出的伟大战斗号召，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
