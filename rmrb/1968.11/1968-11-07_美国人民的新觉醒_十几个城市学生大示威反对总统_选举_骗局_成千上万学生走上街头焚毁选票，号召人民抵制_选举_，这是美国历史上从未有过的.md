	Washington, Nov. 6 (Xinhua) — As the monopolistic capitalist class of the United States, beset by crises, staged the farce of the presidential "election" on Nov. 5, tens of thousands of young students in more than ten cities, including Washington, New York, Chicago, Boston, Newark, and San Francisco, took to the streets to hold protest demonstrations. They burned American flags and ballots, and called on the American people to boycott the "election." This is something that has never happened in the history of U.S. presidential "elections." It shows that more and more Americans have begun to see through the fraud of the U.S. elections and the hypocrisy of bourgeois democracy. The political awareness of the American people is steadily rising.

	In the U.S. capital, Washington, more than a thousand young students held a mass rally at the Lincoln Memorial. At the meeting, many students denounced the U.S. aggression in Vietnam and exposed the fraud of the U.S. presidential "election." After the meeting, the students marched to Lafayette Park opposite the White House to hold a demonstration.

	In New York, more than 500 young students held a protest rally at Union Square and widely exposed to the people that the U.S. presidential candidates are all agents of the monopolistic capitalist class and are all of a feather. They called on everyone to boycott the "election" and not to vote. After the meeting, the students also held a demonstration march.

	In San Francisco, more than 1,500 young students held a rally in the city center square and burned an American flag on the spot to express their opposition to U.S. aggression in Vietnam and the staging of the presidential "election" farce. After the meeting, the students held a massive demonstration, carrying placards opposing the Vietnam War and the presidential "election" fraud. The demonstrators also carried a black-and-white pig, calling it the presidential candidate, to ridicule the U.S. presidential "election."

	In Columbus, Ohio, the demonstrators carried a coffin to mock the U.S. "democratic" system. They also burned many ballots on the spot to express their indignant protest.

	In Boston, more than 2,000 students held a massive demonstration in the city, denouncing the presidential "election" as a fraud. In Maine, the demonstrators surrounded the Democratic vice-presidential candidate Muskie, who was going to vote, shouting slogans against the presidential "election" and making him look ridiculous. In addition, in Newark, Chicago, Ann Arbor, and Rutland in Vermont, young students also held protest demonstrations against the U.S. presidential "election" farce.

	Faced with the protests and demonstrations of young students across the United States, the U.S. reactionary ruling clique sent out large numbers of police, secret agents, and thugs everywhere to suppress the students with various despicable and brutal means. In Newark, the U.S. reactionaries sent out a large number of fascist thugs to beat up the demonstrating students; in San Francisco, a large number of secret agents were sent to monitor the students; in Washington, New York, and other places, police were sent out to arrest students on a large scale.

	However, the U.S. students, undaunted by the violence, continued to hold demonstrations. Many cities' young students fought bravely with the police and secret agents. (Photo attached)

    美国人民的新觉醒
    十几个城市学生大示威反对总统“选举”骗局
    成千上万学生走上街头焚毁选票，号召人民抵制“选举”，这是美国历史上从未有过的
    新华社六日讯　华盛顿消息：正当危机重重的美国垄断资产阶级筹划的总统“选举”丑剧五日在美国正式上演的时候，美国华盛顿、纽约、芝加哥、波士顿、纽瓦克、旧金山等十几个城市的成千上万名青年学生，走上街头，举行示威游行，焚毁美国星条旗和许多选票，号召美国人民抵制“选举”。这种情况在美国总统“选举”的历史上还是从来没有过的，这说明越来越多的美国人民已开始识破美国大选的骗局和资产阶级民主的虚伪性，美国人民的觉悟程度正在不断提高。
    在美国首都华盛顿，一千多名青年学生在林肯纪念碑前举行了群众大会。会上，许多学生发言谴责美国侵略越南的战争，并揭露美国的总统“选举”的骗局。会后，这些学生又游行到美国总统府对面的拉斐特公园举行了示威。
    在纽约，五百多名青年学生在联合广场举行抗议集会，并广泛地向人民群众揭发美国总统候选人都是垄断资产阶级的代理人，都是一丘之貉，号召大家抵制“选举”，不要去投票。会后，这些学生还举行了示威游行。
    在旧金山，一千五百多名青年学生在市中心的广场上举行了集会，当场焚毁一面美国星条旗，表示他们反对美国侵略越南和上演总统“选举”丑剧。会后学生们高举反对侵越战争和总统“选举”骗局的标语牌举行了声势浩大的示威。示威群众还抬了一头黑白相间的花毛猪，把它称作总统候选人，来讽刺美国总统“选举”。
    在俄亥俄州的哥伦布市，示威群众抬了一口棺材，用以挖苦美国的“民主”制度。他们还当场烧毁了许多选票，来表示他们的愤怒的抗议。
    在波士顿市，二千多名学生在市区举行声势浩大的示威，谴责总统“选举”是个骗局。在缅因，示威群众包围了去投票的民主党副总统候选人马斯基，高呼反对总统“选举”的口号，把他搞得狼狈不堪。此外，在纽瓦克，芝加哥，安阿伯，以及在佛蒙特州的拉特兰等城市，都爆发了青年学生反对美国总统“选举”丑剧的示威游行。
    面临美国各地青年学生的抗议和示威，美国反动统治集团到处派出大批警察、特务和打手，用各种卑鄙、残酷的手段去镇压学生。在纽瓦克，美国反动派出动了大批法西斯打手，对示威的学生大打出手；在旧金山，出动了大批特务对学生进行监视；在华盛顿、纽约等地，更出动了警察，大规模逮捕学生。
    但是，美国学生不畏强暴坚持举行示威，许多城市的青年学生同警察、特务进行了英勇搏斗。（附图片）
