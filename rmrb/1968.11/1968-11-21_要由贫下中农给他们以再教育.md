The revolutionary suggestions by comrades Hou Zhenmin and Wang Qingyu fundamentally solve the major issue of ensuring that the control of rural primary school education is permanently in the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants. This is a directionally sound suggestion for the rural educational revolution. All of us, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and rural revolutionary cadres, wholeheartedly applaud it.

The proletarian educational revolution aims to completely end the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating our schools. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to reform the old educational system, as well as the old teaching principles and methods. Some issues in the educational revolution have already been resolved, and others are in the process of being resolved. Currently, what deserves our attention is the issue of transforming the educators, that is, the teacher corps.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The key to educational reform lies in the teachers." Teachers are an extremely important component of schools and are the direct educators of people. What books are taught and what kind of successors are cultivated depend, to a certain extent, on the educators. To completely change the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating our schools, we must resolve the issue of the ideological transformation of the teacher corps.

The working people are the driving force behind the creation of world history and are also the creators of culture. The poor and lower-middle peasants are the most loyal to Chairman Mao, the most attentive to Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and the most proficient in learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought. They are the most knowledgeable about proletarian education and the most hostile to bourgeois education. They have experienced long-term complex class struggles and production practices, accumulating rich experience, and are a crucial force in rural education. In contrast, the situation in old China has always been that teachers educate people, while students and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are the ones being educated. The number one capitalist-roader within the Party, Liu Shaoqi, and his accomplices frenziedly promoted the revisionist educational line of "those who labor with their minds rule over others, and those who labor with their strength are ruled over by others." For a long time, bourgeois intellectuals have monopolized a part of the superstructure, including the domination of schools. The proletariat must carry out proletarian education, that is, education based on Mao Zedong Thought, class struggle education, and education that combines theory with labor practice.

To carry out proletarian education, relying solely on the original school teachers is not enough. Because a significant portion of them have received bourgeois education in the past and are deeply influenced by it; some come from exploiting class families and are deeply influenced by exploiting class ideology. Their thoughts and teaching methods are basically bourgeois. Therefore, under the correct leadership, the workers, peasants, and soldiers must re-educate them, thoroughly changing their old thoughts, and on this basis, organize a new revolutionary teacher corps that is united with the poor and lower-middle peasants and armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

School teachers who are currently in service should not only engage in teaching work but should mainly go deep into the poor and lower-middle peasants, take the poor and lower-middle peasants as their teachers, learn class struggle and labor production from them, accept the re-education of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and thoroughly transform their bourgeois worldview. Educational work should change from the past patriarchal, injective teaching method to a mass discussion-style teaching method where teachers teach students, students teach teachers, and students teach students. This will have profound significance for the teachers themselves and for cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    要由贫下中农给他们以再教育
    侯振民、王庆余两位同志的革命建议，从根本上解决了农村小学教育大权永远掌握在贫下中农手中这个大问题，是农村教育革命的方向性的好建议。我们广大贫下中农、农村革命干部无不为之叫好。
    无产阶级教育革命，就是要彻底结束资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，用毛泽东思想改革旧的教育制度，改革旧的教学方针和方法。教育革命中有些问题已经得到了解决，有的正在解决。目前，摆在我们面前值得引起重视的，是教育者即教师队伍的改造问题。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“教改的问题，主要是教员问题。”教员是组成学校的一个极其重要的部分，是直接教育人的。教什么样的书，培养什么样的接班人，在某种程度上取决于教育者。要彻底改变资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，必须解决好教师队伍的思想革命化问题。
    劳动人民是创造世界历史的动力，也是文化的创造者。贫下中农对毛主席最忠，对毛主席的最新指示跟得最紧，对毛泽东思想学得最好、用得最活，最懂得无产阶级教育，最痛恨资产阶级教育。他们经历过长期的复杂的阶级斗争和生产实践，积累了丰富的经验，是农村教育的重要骨干力量。而旧中国历来的情况是：教员是教育人的，学生以及广大贫下中农是被教育的。党内头号走资派刘少奇及其同伙疯狂推行“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的修正主义教育路线。长期以来，资产阶级知识分子独霸一部分上层建筑，其中包括对学校的统治。无产阶级就是要进行无产阶级的教育，即进行毛泽东思想的教育，阶级斗争的教育，理论与劳动实践相结合的教育。
    要进行无产阶级的教育，单靠原来的学校教师是不行的。由于他们中的相当一部分人，在过去受的是资产阶级教育，中毒较深；有的则出身于剥削阶级家庭，受剥削阶级的思想影响较深，这些人的思想和教育方法基本上还是资产阶级的。因此，必须“在正确路线领导之下，由工农兵给他们以再教育，彻底改变旧思想”，并在这个基础上组织一支与贫下中农相结合的、用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命化的崭新的教师队伍。
    学校中在职的革命教员，不仅要从事教学工作，更主要的是要深入到贫下中农中间去，拜贫下中农为师，向贫下中农学阶级斗争，学劳动生产，接受贫下中农的再教育，彻底改造自己的资产阶级世界观。教育工作要改变过去那种家长式、注入式的教育法，采取教员教学生、学生教教员、学生教学生的群众性的讨论式的教育方法。这样，对教师本人和培养无产阶级革命事业的接班人，都有深远意义。
