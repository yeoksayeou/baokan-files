The People's Voice of Albania publishes an editorial highly praising the ever-deepening friendship between Albania and China

The friendship between Albania and China is a genuine revolutionary and combat-ready friendship

The friendship between Albania and China, built on the foundations of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, is unbreakable and will last for eternity.

November 23, 1968, New China News Agency, Tirana: The People's Voice of Albania published an editorial on November 23 to commemorate the 19th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Albania and China and the recent signing of the economic and trade agreement between the two countries. The editorial highly praises the ever-deepening friendship between Albania and China.

The editorial points out that in the 19 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between Albania and China, the friendship and comprehensive brotherly relations between the peoples, parties, and governments of the two countries have been continuously developing and strengthening in all areas.

The editorial states that the recent visit of the Albanian People's Republic's government economic delegation to China, the enthusiastic reception by the Chinese people, the very friendly and cordial talks between the Chinese party and government leaders and the delegation, and the new economic and trade agreement signed between the two countries are all new and powerful manifestations of the revolutionary friendship and comprehensive, brotherly cooperation between the peoples of the two countries.

The editorial states that the sincere friendship and brotherly relations between the peoples of Albania and China are built on the immortal principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. The founders of this combat-ready friendship and revolutionary unity are the Marxist-Leninist parties led by Comrade Enver Hoxha and Comrade Mao Zedong. Comrade Enver Hoxha has said: "The genuine revolutionary and combat-ready friendship, the pure and steel-like friendship built on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, binds our two parties, peoples, and socialist countries together. This friendship, forged and strengthened in the common struggle for the victory of the revolutionary and socialist cause, tested in the revolutionary storms and in the heroic struggle against our common enemies—imperialism and modern revisionism, in defense of Marxism-Leninism and for the victory of Marxism-Leninism, is unbreakable and will last for eternity, bringing benefits to our two peoples and to the great communist cause that unites us. No stormy waves can shake its rock-solid foundation."

In discussing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, the editorial notes that the Albanian people and the Albanian Party of Labor fully support this revolution, which has great historical significance not only for the Chinese people but for all revolutionary forces around the world.

The editorial states: The communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China shows that under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China headed by the great Marxist-Leninist Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have achieved decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters represented by the most dangerous enemy Liu Shaoqi and their agents in various places who attempted to usurp the party, the government, and the military. This historic victory of the Chinese people has great international significance.

The editorial states that the People's Republic of China, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has become a powerful bastion of socialism, a strong base for world revolution, a standard-bearer of Marxism-Leninism, and a steadfast and resolute defender of the struggles of the peoples of all countries for freedom and national independence. No force in the world can stop the people of China from advancing victoriously along the revolutionary, socialist, and communist path.

The editorial states that the Albanian people are proud to have 700 million Chinese people as their comrades-in-arms and loyal friends. In every moment of successfully building socialism and defending the freedom and independence of the motherland, the Albanian people have directly felt the power of the Albanian-Chinese combat friendship and the internationalist aid of the brotherly Chinese people. When our enemies—the imperialists and the Khrushchev revisionists—were doing everything in their power to sabotage our economy and force the Albanian people to surrender, when they were plotting conspiracies and carrying out brutal blockades, it was at these difficult times that our true and loyal friends were the Chinese people and the glorious Communist Party of China led by Comrade Mao Zedong.

The editorial states that the Albanian people and the Chinese people will forever stand shoulder to shoulder. Our people will never forget that when socialist Albania took the revolutionary and historic action of withdrawing from the aggressive and enslaving Warsaw Pact, the great people of China gave us very enthusiastic and resolute support. The congratulatory telegrams from the outstanding leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, Comrade Lin Biao, and Comrade Zhou Enlai to our party and government leaders are another new and brilliant manifestation of the friendship and revolutionary unity between our two socialist countries. This is a serious warning to the enemies of our people. This is a powerful support and great encouragement for our people, strengthening our forces in the struggle to defend the freedom and independence of our socialist motherland.

The editorial points out that the recent economic and trade agreement signed in Beijing is another great example of proletarian internationalism that characterizes our friendship, an important symbol of Albanian-Chinese friendship. The Albanian-Chinese economic and trade agreement is a new and great encouragement for the Albanian people who are striving to successfully complete the historic tasks set by the Fifth Party Congress, to complete the Fourth Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and to further promote the economy of our socialist motherland.

The editorial concludes by expressing heartfelt wishes that the unbreakable revolutionary friendship and unity between the peoples of Albania and China will last for eternity in the struggle to build socialism and communism, to achieve the victory of Marxism-Leninism, and to fight against imperialism and revisionism.

    阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》发表社论热烈赞扬阿中友谊不断发展
    阿中友谊是真正的革命战斗友谊
    建立在马列主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的阿中友谊，是牢不可破的，它将万古长青
    新华社地拉那二十三日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》二十三日就阿尔巴尼亚和中国建立外交关系十九周年和阿中两国最近签订经济贸易协定发表社论，热烈赞扬阿中友谊不断发展。
    社论指出，阿中建交十九年来，阿中两国人民之间、两党之间和两国政府之间的友谊和全面的兄弟关系在一切领域中日益发展和巩固。
    社论说，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府经济代表团最近对中国的访问、中国人民对代表团的热情接待、中国党政领导人同代表团举行的十分亲切友好的会谈以及阿中两国之间签订的新的经济贸易协定，都是阿中两国人民之间革命友谊和全面的、兄弟般的合作关系的新的强有力的体现。
    社论说，阿中两国人民之间的真诚友谊和兄弟般的关系，是建立在不朽的马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则基础上的。这种战斗友谊和革命团结的缔造者，是以恩维尔·霍查同志和毛泽东同志为首的我们两个马克思列宁主义的党。恩维尔·霍查同志说过：“建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的真正的革命战斗友谊，纯洁的和坚如钢铁的友谊，把我们两党、两国人民和两个社会主义国家连结在一起。在争取革命和社会主义事业胜利的共同斗争中建立和巩固起来的、在革命风暴和反对共同敌人——帝国主义和现代修正主义、捍卫马克思列宁主义和争取马克思列宁主义胜利的英勇斗争中经受了考验的这一友谊，是牢不可破的，它将万古长青，以造福于我们两国人民，造福于把我们团结在一起的伟大的共产主义事业。任何惊涛骇浪都不能动摇它的坚如磐石的基础。”
    社论在谈到中国无产阶级文化大革命时指出，阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党完全支持这场革命，它不仅对中国人民而且对全世界所有革命力量具有重大的历史意义。
    社论说：中国共产党第八届扩大的十二中全会公报表明，中国人民在以伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党的领导下，在无产阶级文化大革命中取得了决定性的胜利，彻底粉碎了以最危险的敌人刘少奇为代表的妄图篡党、篡政、篡军的资产阶级司令部及其在各地的代理人。中国人民的这一历史性胜利具有重大的国际意义。
    社论说，经受了无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的中华人民共和国，已经成为社会主义的强大堡垒，成为世界革命的强大基地，成为马克思列宁主义的旗手，成为各国人民争取自由和民族独立斗争的坚强的和坚定的捍卫者。世界上没有任何力量能够阻挡人民中国沿着革命的、社会主义的和共产主义的道路胜利前进。
    社论说，阿尔巴尼亚人民为有七亿中国人民作为他们的战友和忠实的朋友而感到自豪。阿尔巴尼亚人民在成功地建设社会主义、维护祖国的自由和独立的每一个时刻，都直接感受到了阿中战斗友谊的力量和兄弟的中国人民的国际主义援助的力量。当我国的敌人——帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者千方百计地破坏我国经济，要阿尔巴尼亚人民屈膝投降的时候，当他们在策划阴谋和实行粗暴封锁的时候，正是在这种困难的时刻，站在我们一边的真正的和忠实的朋友是中国人民和以毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党。
    社论说，阿尔巴尼亚人民和中国人民将永远并肩站在一起。我国人民将永远不会忘记，在社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚采取了革命的具有历史意义的行动——宣布退出侵略性的和奴役性的华沙条约的时候，伟大的人民中国给了我们十分热烈的和坚决的支持。阿尔巴尼亚人民最好的忠实朋友，中国人民的杰出领袖毛泽东主席以及林彪同志和周恩来同志给我们党和政府领导人的贺电，是我们两个社会主义国家之间的友谊和革命的团结的又一新的光辉的体现。这对我国人民的敌人是一个严重的警告。这对我国人民是一种强大的支持和巨大的鼓舞，使我们为维护社会主义祖国的自由和独立而斗争的力量得到了加强。
    社论指出，最近在北京签订的阿中经济贸易协定是标志着我们之间友谊的特点的无产阶级国际主义的又一伟大榜样，是阿中友谊的重要标志。阿中经济贸易协定对正在为胜利完成第五次党代表大会所制订的历史任务、为提前完成第四个五年计划、为进一步促进我们社会主义祖国的经济而斗争的阿尔巴尼亚人民，是一个新的极大的鼓舞。
    社论最后表示衷心祝愿阿中两国人民之间的牢不可破的革命友谊和团结在建设社会主义和共产主义、争取马克思列宁主义的胜利的斗争中、在反对帝国主义和修正主义的斗争中万古长青。
