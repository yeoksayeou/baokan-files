The red waves of radio transmission, crossing over countless mountains and rivers, on one evening brought the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to the northernmost part of China, the Hezhe ethnic village of Jietoukou in Tongjiang County, Heilongjiang Province. This smallest ethnic minority village in the country immediately boiled over. The soldiers and officers of a certain border defense station of the People's Liberation Army stationed at this anti-revisionist outpost, together with the revolutionary masses of the Hezhe ethnicity, rushed to the celebration rally in front of the commune revolutionary committee.

In front of the commune revolutionary committee, a scene of jubilation unfolded. People cheered for the issuance of the communiqué, celebrated the great and decisive victory of the Cultural Revolution, and repeatedly shouted, "Long live the great leader of all ethnic peoples, Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" At the celebration, the commander of the border defense station, Zhao Guangshan, spoke first. When he mentioned that the plenary session decided to expel the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever, everyone clapped in approval. An 78-year-old Hezhe ethnic poor peasant, Old Man Peng, shakily walked out from the crowd. He recounted the bitterness of the old society and the sweetness of the new society. He said, "Chairman Mao is our Hezhe people's great savior. The Hezhe people will never forget Chairman Mao's kindness for generations! But Liu Shaoqi tried to make us suffer twice, but now Chairman Mao has led us to overthrow him, which is truly heartwarming!"

Old Man Peng's words stirred the hearts of every Hezhe person. The deputy commander of the Hezhe ethnic women's militia, Fu Xiu Lan, could not suppress her inner excitement. She stood up and said, "The issuance of the communiqué is a great joy for us Hezhe people. We women militia members will definitely respond to the call of the plenary session and build the northern border of our motherland into an impregnable fortress against imperialism and revisionism. If the enemy dares to invade, we will definitely annihilate them!"

The night deepened, but the enthusiasm of the people grew even higher. The Hezhe compatriots sang songs praising Chairman Mao, danced ethnic dances, 72-year-old Old Man Yue He played the trumpet, and joyfully played "The East Is Red." 60-year-old Aunt Qiao sang "Wishing Chairman Mao a Long Life." The border defense soldiers sang "The Ship Sails on the Sea Depends on the Helm." The enthusiastic praises of the great leader of all ethnic peoples, Chairman Mao, echoed like the waves of the Heilongjiang River, shaking the night sky of the northern border of the motherland.

    沸腾的赫哲族山村
    红色的电波，越过千山万水，在一日晚，把党的八届扩大的十二中全会的公报传到了祖国最北部的黑龙江省同江县街津口；这个全国最小的少数民族赫哲族居住的山村，立刻沸腾起来了。驻守在这个反修前哨的解放军某部边防站的指战员与赫哲族革命群众，一起涌向公社革委会门前的庆祝大会会场。
    公社革委会门前一片欢腾。人们欢呼公报的发表，欢呼文化大革命的伟大的、决定性的胜利，不断高呼：“各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    庆祝会上，边防站站长赵广山首先讲话，当他讲到全会决定把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党时，人人拍手称快。七十八岁的赫哲族贫农彭老大爷从人群中颤颤巍巍地走了出来，他诉了旧社会的苦，讲了新社会的甜。他说：“毛主席是我们赫哲人的大救星，赫哲人世世代代忘不了毛主席的恩情！可是刘少奇硬想叫我们吃二遍苦，受二遍罪，现在毛主席领导我们把他打倒了，真是大快人心！”
    彭老大爷的话，激动着每一个赫哲人的心。赫哲族女民兵连副指导员傅秀兰怎么也抑制不住内心的激动，她站起来说：“公报的发表是我们赫哲人的大喜事，我们女民兵一定坚决响应全会的号召，把祖国北部边疆建成反帝反修的铜墙铁壁。如果敌人胆敢进犯，就把他们坚决消灭干净！”
    夜深了，可是人们的兴致却越来越高。赫哲族同胞们，有的唱起了歌颂毛主席的民歌，有的跳起了民族舞蹈，七十二岁的岳和老大爷吹起了喇叭，纵情高奏《东方红》，六十多岁的乔大娘唱起了《祝福毛主席万寿无疆》，边防战士高唱《大海航行靠舵手》……，热情颂扬各族人民伟大领袖毛主席的阵阵歌声，犹如黑龙江的涛声，震动着祖国北部边疆的夜空。　新华社通讯员　新华社记者
