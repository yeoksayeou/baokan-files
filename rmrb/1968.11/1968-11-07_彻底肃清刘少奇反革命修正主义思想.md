At the great and historic Party's Eighth Plenum of the Twelfth Central Committee, chaired by our great leader Chairman Mao, a resolution was unanimously adopted to expel the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever, to remove all his Party and state positions, and to continue to expose the crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices in betraying the Party and the country. This resolution expresses the wishes of us revolutionary soldiers. We are filled with revolutionary fervor and shout a thousand times, ten thousand times, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!"

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is completely necessary and very timely for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist restoration, and building socialism." We are stationed on a small island far from the mainland, where the realities of class struggle have made us deeply understand the great wisdom and correctness of Chairman Mao's teachings. Before the Cultural Revolution, due to the promotion of "three freedoms and one contract" and other counter-revolutionary revisionist goods by the top capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi, a wind of capitalist restoration also blew through this small fishing village. The village has 29 households and 85 mu of mountain land. In a short time, more than 50 mu were divided up, seriously damaging the collective socialist economy. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, our unit responded to Chairman Mao's call to "support the leftist masses" and joined the peasants in the struggle. Here, we used Chairman Mao's instructions as our weapon and Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies as our target, combining the class struggle in our village with the broad masses of commune members to launch a vigorous mass movement of revolutionary criticism. Through revolutionary criticism, we raised everyone's awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. People voluntarily returned the more than 50 mu of land that had been divided up to the production team, smashing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary plot. Now, in this small fishing village, every household hangs a portrait of Chairman Mao, everywhere is a classroom for studying Chairman Mao's works, and terraced fields like those in Dazhai rise layer upon layer, with various grains growing on the slopes.

The Party's Eighth Plenum of the Twelfth Central Committee has issued a great battle call, which we will resolutely carry out. We are determined to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of Comrade An Yemin, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants of the fishing village, to continue to deepen the revolutionary criticism, thoroughly eliminate the counter-revolutionary revisionist thoughts of Liu Shaoqi and other top capitalist-roaders within the Party, and to be highly vigilant and strengthen our preparedness. We will closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and achieve new victories in the great struggle to win a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    彻底肃清刘少奇反革命修正主义思想
    海军某部安业民生前所在连五好战士　许忠杰
    在我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持的有伟大历史意义的党的八届扩大的十二中全会上，一致通过决议：把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇永远开除出党，撤消其党内外的一切职务，并继续清算刘少奇及其同伙叛党叛国的罪行。这个决议，表达了我们革命战士的愿望。我们满怀革命豪情，千遍万遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”
    伟大领袖毛主席指出：“这次无产阶级文化大革命，对于巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，建设社会主义，是完全必要的，是非常及时的。”我们驻守在远离祖国大陆的一个小岛的渔村里，这里阶级斗争的实际，使我们深刻认识到毛主席的这一教导无比英明、无比正确。文化大革命以前，由于党内头号走资派刘少奇推行“三自一包”等反革命修正主义黑货，这个小渔村也刮起了一股复辟资本主义的黑风。小渔村共有二十九户，八十五亩山地，不长时间内就分掉了五十多亩，使社会主义集体经济受到了严重破坏。在毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们连响应毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，和贫下中农一起投入了无产阶级文化大革命的洪流。在这里，我们以毛主席的指示为武器，以刘少奇的反革命修正主义谬论为靶子，结合本村的阶级斗争实际，同广大社员一道，开展了轰轰烈烈的革命大批判的群众运动。通过革命大批判，提高了大家的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，人们主动把分掉的五十多亩地全部交回了生产队，粉碎了刘少奇的反革命阴谋。如今，这个小渔村，家家挂起毛主席像，处处是学习毛主席著作的课堂，大寨梯田层层起，五谷杂粮长满坡。
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会提出了伟大的战斗号召，我们坚决贯彻执行。我们决心发扬安业民同志的革命精神，同渔村贫下中农一道，继续深入展开革命大批判，肃清刘少奇等党内最大的一小撮走资派的反革命修正主义的思想，并百倍提高警惕，加强战备，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中立新功。（新华社）
