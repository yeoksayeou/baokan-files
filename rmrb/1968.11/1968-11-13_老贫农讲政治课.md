In the classroom of Zhao Jia Ling Primary School in He Tao Commune, Laoshan County, Shandong Province, an old poor peasant stood on the podium. Using his own bitter family history as teaching material, he gave a political lesson to the students. As the students listened to his denunciation of the old society, they were filled with boundless hatred towards the exploiting classes, repeatedly shouting, "Never forget the bitterness of class oppression, always remember the blood debt!" "Down with the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi!"

This school used to give political lessons, but the teachers were "three-separated" educators lacking proletarian feelings, and their teaching methods were rote memorization. The students couldn't understand a thing. After the poor and lower-middle peasants, the most reliable allies of the working class, took over the management of the school, they hoisted the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and took to the school podium themselves.

The old peasant on the podium today was Zhao Shouzan, who had begged for food for generations. He brought his broken basket and bowl from the old society onto the podium. Holding the broken basket and bowl in both hands, with tears welling up in his eyes, he recounted to the students the deep hatred and grievances of the poor and lower-middle peasants under the brutal oppression of the landlord class, one by one, one incident after another. The more he spoke, the more excited he became, and the students listened with increasing hatred towards the wicked old society.

On the podium, Grandpa Zhao read aloud a passage from the great leader Chairman Mao: "Class struggle has not ended. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, and the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm are all long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very intense." He continued, "Children! We poor and lower-middle peasants have risen up and taken power. We must never forget the Communist Party when we rise up, and we must never forget Chairman Mao when we are happy. We must remember Chairman Mao's teaching to 'never forget class struggle.' The class enemies who have been overthrown are like the green onions in December, with dry skin, rotten leaves, but a living heart. Although they appear to be obedient on the surface, they are always thinking of 'reversing the sky' behind the scenes."

Grandpa Zhao, using a living example from the village, continued to educate the students on class struggle. This living example was originally a fake village head. In the old society, he committed countless crimes against the people. After liberation, he fled in fear of punishment for over ten years and was caught and put under control by the revolutionary masses in 1964. This scoundrel appeared to be very obedient on the surface but continued to oppose the people in his heart, spreading reactionary remarks. Grandpa Zhao used this fake village head as a living example to thoroughly explain the importance of never forgetting class struggle. Then, the students stood up one by one to speak, criticizing Liu Shaoqi's theory of the "extinction of class struggle."

The old peasant taking to the school podium made the classroom truly a place for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, a battlefield for revolutionary criticism!

　　老贫农讲政治课
    山东崂山县河套公社赵家岭小学的讲台上，站着一位老贫农。他以自己的苦难家史做教材，给学生们上政治课。学生们听着他对旧社会的控诉，激起了对剥削阶级的无比仇恨，不停地高呼：“不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇！”“打倒叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇！”
    这所学校，过去也上政治课，但讲课人是缺乏无产阶级感情的“三脱离”教师，讲课的方法是照本宣科，学生们根本听不出个道道来。工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校后，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，自己登上了学校的讲台。
    这天上讲台的老贫农，是几辈子要饭的赵守赞大爷。他把在旧社会要饭时用的破篮子、破碗带上了讲台。赵大爷双手拿起破篮子、破碗，含着满眶热泪，把贫下中农受地主阶级残酷压迫的深仇大恨，一件件、一桩桩讲给学生们听。他越讲越激动，学生们越听越痛恨万恶的旧社会。
    在讲台上，赵大爷朗读了伟大领袖毛主席的一段语录：“阶级斗争并没有结束。无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。”他接着说：孩子们！咱们贫下中农翻了身，掌了大权，一定要翻身不忘共产党，幸福不忘毛主席；要牢记毛主席的“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导。被打倒的阶级敌人，象腊月的大葱，皮焦叶烂心不死。别看他们表面上装得老实，背地里却时刻都在想着“变天”。
    赵大爷讲到这里，用本村一个活教材，继续向学生进行阶级斗争的教育。这个活教材，原来是一个伪保长。在旧社会，他无恶不作，对人民犯下了滔天罪行。解放后，他畏罪潜逃十几年，一九六四年被革命群众揪回，管制起来。这个坏蛋表面上装得挺老实，骨子里却继续与人民为敌，散布反动言论。赵大爷以这个伪保长做活教材，详细地讲述了要念念不忘阶级斗争的道理。接着，学生们纷纷起立发言，痛批刘少奇的“阶级斗争熄灭论”。
    老贫农登上学校讲台，使课堂真正成了活学活用毛泽东思想的课堂，成了革命大批判的战场！
