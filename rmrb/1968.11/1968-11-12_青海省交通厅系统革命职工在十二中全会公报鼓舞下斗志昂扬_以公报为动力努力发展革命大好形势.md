Revolutionary workers of the Qinghai Provincial Transportation Department, inspired by the communiqué of the Twelfth Plenum, are fighting spirit soaring. With the communiqué as their driving force, they are striving to develop the great revolutionary situation. They have launched a mass movement of "study the communiqué, find gaps, formulate measures, and take action," achieving excellent results. Revolutionary and production victories are frequently reported, presenting a vibrant and prosperous scene.

The Qinghai Provincial Transportation Department's revolutionary committee, in the midst of the fervor of studying, promoting, and implementing the communiqué of the Twelfth Plenum, has launched a mass movement of "study the communiqué, find gaps, formulate measures, and take action," achieving excellent results. Their specific measures are as follows:

1. Study the communiqué, take action, and grasp the "speed" factor. In recent days, the Qinghai Provincial Transportation Department has held celebration meetings, discussion meetings, and mobilization meetings, carrying out activities to study, promote, and implement the communiqué. Broad masses of transportation workers unanimously declared: We must ride the strong east wind of the Twelfth Plenum communiqué to complete the great combat mission entrusted to us by Chairman Mao. The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at the Qinghai People's Press rushed to print the full text of the communiqué on the night of November 1st and distributed it to various fronts. The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at the Humeng Pastoral School, on the day after the communiqué was issued, led revolutionary teachers and students of five ethnic groups to form propaganda squads, carrying backpacks, climbing mountains, and wading through rivers to reach pastoral and rural areas, propagating the communiqué to the broad masses of commune members. The commune members joyfully said: "The workers, big brothers sent by Chairman Mao, have brought us the greatest good news from Beijing." When the communiqué reached the top of Tanggula Mountain, the Tibetan workers of the 107th station, fighting at an altitude of over 5,000 meters above the snow line, were particularly moved. They repeatedly shouted in high spirits: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" The Tibetan worker Zhu Zhu, born a slave, heard the good news and, although the high mountain was shrouded in wind and snow, he decided to quickly spread this heart-warming news to the nearby herdsmen. Comrades advised him to wait until the wind and snow stopped before going, but Zhu Zhu said: "I am a slave who grew up under the whip of the landlord and headman. It was Chairman Mao who saved me from the fire pit, but the big villain Liu Shaoqi wanted us to go back on our path and suffer twice. I hate him to the core. Now that the big villain Liu Shaoqi has been thoroughly overthrown, such heart-warming good news, how can I wait until the wind and snow stop to tell my Tibetan class brothers!" The rapid implementation of the communiqué has produced tremendous material force in the Qinghai Provincial Transportation Department system. Workers of the Highway Bureau's truck team, who have completed the 1968 production plan 70 days ahead of schedule, have decided to work hard for 50 days to complete the first quarter's production task for next year. Workers of the Second Automobile Repair Factory, the Eighth Automobile Depot, the Tire Retreading Factory, and other revolutionary units, who have completed this year's production tasks more than two months ahead of schedule, have unanimously declared that they will overfulfill production again and again, and achieve meritorious deeds again and again.

2. Study the communiqué, find gaps, formulate measures, and grasp the "practicality" factor. The Qinghai Provincial Transportation Department and its subordinate highway and transportation bureaus have not fully understood the great significance of cadres going down to labor, resulting in some ideological issues that have affected the work of cadres going down to labor. After the communiqué was issued, they found the gaps and unanimously agreed: "There are thousands and tens of thousands of gaps, but the most fundamental one is the lack of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao." Inspired by the communiqué, the transportation system has launched a wave of cadres going down to labor. On November 7th, the first batch of 132 section-level cadres went down to labor. During the process of cadres going down to labor, the Qinghai Provincial Transportation Department system, with the communiqué as the driving force, organized a three-in-one leadership team consisting of revolutionary leading cadres, support-left personnel, and revolutionary rebels, and firmly grasped the three implementations: the ideological implementation of cadres going down to labor, organizational implementation, and material preparation implementation. They also, in conjunction with the combat tasks proposed by the communiqué, reviewed the various aspects of revolutionary and production work in the previous stage, further formulated the arrangements and implementation measures for the work of cleaning up class ranks, rectifying the party, reforming unreasonable regulations and systems, and streamlining organizations, and further promoted the struggle, criticism, and transformation throughout the system.

3. Study the communiqué, grasp education, and grasp the "criticism" factor. The transportation system, with the communiqué as a weapon, has fiercely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods of the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi, further raising the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the workers. In recent days, various units of the Qinghai Provincial Transportation Department system have held multiple criticism meetings. Broad masses of revolutionary workers have expressed their indignation against the number one capitalist-roader in the party, Liu Shaoqi. Comrade Chen Qilin, an old Red Army soldier who followed Chairman Mao in battles for forty years, the head of the revolutionary committee of the Transportation Department, used his personal experience to enthusiastically praise the greatness of Chairman Mao and the invincibility of Mao Zedong Thought; angrily denounced the heinous crimes of Liu Shaoqi in betraying the working class and revolution. A batch of "three-doors" cadres who have long been stationed in the office of the Qinghai Provincial Transportation Department, in the process of studying the communiqué, have stood up to criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that Liu Shaoqi promoted in the cadre line. Through the revolutionary criticism, these "three-doors" cadres have resolutely declared: They will definitely put down their airs, take the road of integrating with workers and peasants, and wash away the dirt and stench of Liu Shaoqi's revisionist poison that has stained their bodies with the sweat of labor. Broad masses of revolutionary workers have also, with their own blood-stained family histories, bitterly denounced Liu Shaoqi's fallacies such as "exploitation is meritorious." The revolutionary enthusiasm of broad masses of revolutionary workers in fighting against the enemy has reached an unprecedented height, promoting the work of cleaning up class ranks to be carried out in depth.

4. In the fervor of studying and implementing the communiqué, the Qinghai Provincial Transportation Department system has firmly grasped the "four leads," that is, Communist Party members, support-left personnel of the People's Liberation Army, members of the revolutionary committee, and revolutionary rebel warriors taking the lead, playing a model role in executing the various combat tasks proposed by the communiqué. For example, in the process of cadres going down to labor, Communist Party members and revolutionary rebel warriors have taken the lead in signing up, requesting to be the first batch to go down to labor. Due to the firm grasp of the four leads, the Qinghai Provincial Transportation Department system has quickly implemented the section-level cadres going down to labor.

At present, the broad masses of revolutionary workers and support-left soldiers of the Qinghai Provincial Transportation Department system are studying, promoting, and implementing the communiqué of the Twelfth Plenum more deeply. With their boundless proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, they have unanimously declared: They will resolutely advance along the revolutionary course indicated by the communiqué, seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

　　青海省交通厅系统革命职工在十二中全会公报鼓舞下斗志昂扬
　　以公报为动力努力发展革命大好形势
    他们掀起一个“学公报，找差距，订措施，见行动”的群众运动，取得了很好效果。革命和生产捷报频传，呈现一派生气勃勃的兴旺景象
    本报讯　青海省交通厅系统广大革命职工和支左人民解放军指战员，在党的八届十二中全会公报鼓舞下，意气风发，斗志昂扬，以公报为动力，努力发展大好形势。连日来，革命生产捷报频传，整个交通运输战线，呈现一派生气勃勃的兴旺景象。
    青海省交通厅系统革命委员会，在认真学习、宣传和落实党的十二中全会公报的热潮中，掀起了一个“学公报，找差距，订措施，见行动”的群众运动，取得了很好的效果。他们的具体措施是：
    一、学公报，见行动，狠抓一个“快”字。最近几天来，青海省交通厅系统纷纷举行庆祝大会、座谈会和誓师大会，开展了对公报的学习、宣传和落实的活动，广大交通运输产业工人一致表示：我们一定要借八届十二中全会公报的强劲东风，胜利完成毛主席他老人家交给我们工人阶级的伟大的战斗任务。交通厅进驻青海人民出版社的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，十一月一日当晚，就把公报全文翻印成册，送到各条战线。这个厅派驻湟源牧校的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，在公报发表的第二天，就带领学校五个民族的革命师生，组成宣传小分队，背起背包，爬山涉水，奔赴牧区农村，向广大社员宣传公报。社员高兴地说：“毛主席派来的工人老大哥，给我们传来了北京城里的最大福音。”当公报传到唐古拉山顶时，战斗在海拔五千多米雪线上的一○七道班藏族工人，心情特别激动，他们连声激昂高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”农奴出身的藏族工人朱珠听到喜讯后，虽然高山风雪弥漫，但他决心把这个大快人心的消息，迅速传给附近的牧民。同志们劝他等风雪停了以后再去，朱珠说：“我是牧主、头人皮鞭下长大的奴隶，是毛主席把我从火坑里救了出来，可是刘少奇这个大坏蛋，要我们走回头路，受二遍苦，我恨透了他。现在刘少奇这个大坏蛋永远被打倒了，这样大快人心的好消息，怎么能等风雪停了再告诉藏族阶级兄弟！”公报的迅速落实，在青海省交通厅系统产生了巨大的物质力量。已经提前七十天完成一九六八年生产计划的公路局汽车队革命职工，决心大干五十天，完成明年第一季度的生产任务。提前两个多月完成今年生产任务的汽修二厂、汽车八场、轮胎翻修厂等广大革命职工纷纷表示，要超产再超产，立功再立功。
    二、学公报，找差距，订措施，狠抓一个“实”字。青海省交通厅及其所属的公路、运输两局的机关干部，过去对干部下放劳动的伟大意义认识不足，存在不少活思想，致使干部下放劳动的工作受到影响。公报发表后，他们找出了差距，一致认为：“差距有千条万条，最根本的一条，就是对伟大领袖毛主席的不忠。”在公报的鼓舞下，交通运输系统机关掀起了一个干部下放劳动的热潮。十一月七日，一百三十二名科室干部首批下放劳动。在干部下放劳动过程中，青海省交通厅系统，以公报为动力，组织了一个有革命领导干部、支左人员和革命造反派参加的三结合领导班子，狠抓三落实，即干部下放劳动的思想落实、组织落实、物质准备落实。他们还结合公报提出的战斗任务，检查了前一阶段革命和生产方面的各项工作，进一步制订了清理阶级队伍、整党建党、改革不合理的规章制度和精简机构等项工作的安排计划和落实措施，更加深入地推动了全系统的斗、批、改。
    三、学公报，抓教育，狠抓一个“批”字。交通运输系统以公报为武器，狠批叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义黑货，进一步提高了职工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。连日来，青海省交通厅系统各单位召开了多次批判会，广大革命职工同仇敌忾，表示了对党内头号走资派刘少奇最大的革命义愤。曾跟随毛主席南征北战四十年的老红军战士、交通厅革委会主任陈其林同志，用亲身经历，热烈颂扬了毛主席的英明伟大，颂扬了战无不胜的毛泽东思想；愤怒地控诉了刘少奇出卖工人阶级、背叛革命的滔天罪行。青海省交通厅一批长期蹲在机关的“三门”干部，在学习公报中，纷纷起来批判刘少奇在干部路线上推行的反革命修正主义路线。通过革命大批判，这些“三门”干部坚决表示：一定放下架子，走与工农相结合的道路，用劳动的汗水洗刷刘少奇修正主义毒素染在自己身上的污垢和臭气。广大革命职工还用自己血泪斑斑的家史，对刘少奇“剥削有功”等谬论，进行了血泪的控诉。广大革命职工对敌斗争的积极性空前高涨，推动了清理阶级队伍工作深入地开展。
    四、在学习公报、落实公报的热潮中，青海省交通厅系统，狠抓“四带头”，即共产党员、解放军支左人员、革委会成员、无产阶级革命造反派战士首先带头，在执行公报提出的各项战斗任务中，起到了模范作用。例如在干部下放劳动中，共产党员、革命造反派战士首先带头报名，要求第一批下放劳动。青海省交通厅系统由于狠抓了四个带头，使科室干部下放劳动很快落实。
    目前，青海省交通厅系统广大革命职工和支左解放军指战员正在更深入地学习、宣传、落实党的十二中全会公报，他们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限深厚的无产阶级感情，一致表示：决心沿着公报指引的革命航道奋勇前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
