The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "We cannot follow the old path of technological development of all countries in the world, crawling behind others step by step." The great feat in the history of world bridges, the completion of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge in our country, radiates the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, proving the absolute correctness of Chairman Mao's proletarian scientific and technological line, and fully demonstrates the revolutionary heroism of our country's working class, daring to climb peaks and forge new paths. At the same time, in the face of the completion of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, it also declares the complete bankruptcy of the "crawling philosophy" of the traitor Liu Shaoqi's promotion of the revisionist scientific and technological line. Look, one train after another roars across the majestic Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge. The traitor Liu Shaoqi and his ilk, who are servile and slavish, worship foreign countries and imitate them, completely kneel at the feet of the "foreigners," and only know how to crawl, will they not quietly admit defeat? The facts are so merciless!

To eliminate the poison of the revisionist scientific and technological line promoted by the traitor Liu Shaoqi, the representatives of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge workers recently held a meeting to criticize his "crawling philosophy."

Below is a summary of the speeches made by the bridge workers who participated in this criticism meeting.

Long Live Chairman Mao's Self-Reliance Policy

Li Shaofeng (a revolutionary cadre of worker origin):

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We advocate self-reliance. We hope to have foreign aid, but we cannot rely on it. We rely on our own efforts and the creative power of the entire army and people."

Chairman Mao's self-reliance policy is the only correct policy for our country's construction. However, the traitor Liu Shaoqi and his ilk, attempting to restore capitalism, openly sing the opposite tune to Chairman Mao's policy. They peddled a whole set of revisionist goods in the bridge construction, following the "foreigners" and advocating the "crawling philosophy." The traitor Liu Shaoqi said, "Others do high and fast, we temporarily do low and slow." His agent in the Ministry of Railways arrogantly said, "Self-reliance is creating difficulties for oneself." This is extremely reactionary!

"Self-reliance is creating difficulties for oneself"? Tell the revisionist lords, you are right. The Chinese working class, to change the face of poverty and backwardness in the country, must work hard, make a revolution, and strive in every possible way to build socialism. The Chinese working class is determined not to be bullied by imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries again, and has the courage to face difficulties head-on! "Knowing there are tigers in the mountain, we still go to the tiger mountain," and we will not rest until we achieve our goal! We built the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge by our own hands and through invention and creation. We will not be like you, bowing down to the "foreigners," content to do low and slow work, and willing to crawl.

What is the purpose of the traitor Liu Shaoqi and his ilk in promoting the "crawling philosophy" in the scientific and technological line? In a nutshell, it is to serve their restoration of capitalism. They are afraid that China will rapidly become strong, and proletarian dictatorship will become more consolidated, destroying their dream of restoring capitalism. If they do "low and slow," do not "create difficulties for oneself," and remain in a backward state for a long time, they will have an easier time. The problem is clear: we must implement the self-reliance policy, while they want to promote the "crawling philosophy." This is a struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads. We, the working class, must not be fooled. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words and act according to his instructions. "The Chinese people have the spirit and ability to catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future," and have the ability to stand independently among the nations of the world." Now, we have designed, constructed, and installed the world-class Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge by ourselves! We did not use a single "foreigner" or foreign equipment; it was all done through "self-reliance." We shout: Long live Chairman Mao's self-reliance policy!

With the Leadership of the Working Class, Self-Reliance is Possible

Song Chuanfu (rigging worker) and Luo Xiaohua (concrete worker):

In building socialism, the question of whether to rely on the working class and launch a mass movement or to rely on the bourgeoisie and follow the "expert line" is an important issue in the struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads. The traitor Liu Shaoqi advocates the "crawling philosophy," sabotages Chairman Mao's self-reliance policy, and vigorously promotes the "expert line," opposing the leadership of the working class and the mass movement. He said, "Do not think that relying on the working class means there are no problems," and "especially rely on managers, engineers, and technicians." He also shouted, "The chief engineer... is fully responsible for the technical work of the enterprise." The walking capitalists in the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau followed their master's lead, vigorously implementing the "expert line," and everything was decided by the "experts" and "authorities," excluding the working class. A walking capitalist even arrogantly said, "In terms of technology, if you violate the 'authority's' regulations, party members will be expelled from the party, league members will be expelled from the league, and the masses will be punished." This greatly suppressed the wisdom and creativity of the worker masses and dealt a severe blow to the revolutionary enthusiasm of the worker masses.

In theory, workers are the creators of social wealth. Workers work on the construction site day in and day out, facing wind and rain, and are most familiar with and have the most practical knowledge of engineering technology. However, those bourgeois "authorities" simply do not listen to the workers' opinions. What the workers think should be done, they do not allow; what they think should not be done, they force them to do. Take the piling of a certain pier, for example. The "experts" decided to drive the piles without water injection, and the workers thought this method was difficult and would break the piles. The walking capitalists in the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau still insisted that the workers follow the "experts'" decision, resulting in the breaking of more than twenty piles. We workers saw this and felt heartbroken, so we submitted our opinions. However, the walking capitalists still called in a group of "experts" and "authorities" to study the matter. Those reactionary technical "authorities" filled with bourgeois ideology could only come up with nonsense like "the more you drive, the more you break; the less you drive, the less you break; the less you drive, the less you break." They even shamelessly said, "Breaking piles is a normal phenomenon, and it is written in foreign books." A walking capitalist did not dare to say a word against these absurd arguments but instead told the workers, "Today, all the 'authorities' are sitting here! The engineers' decision is very good, and you should listen to the engineers." We workers heard this and got angry, pointing at their noses and shouting, "Good! Let you do it. If you don't break the piles, then you really have the ability!" This silenced them. The working class has this temper: anything that does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought must be opposed, even if it means losing one's head! However, at that time, the leadership of engineering technology was in the hands of those bourgeois lords, who implemented bourgeois dictatorship over the workers, suppressing dissenting opinions. Many good suggestions were suppressed.

What kind of people are these arrogant and overbearing "experts" and "authorities"? Among them, many are either remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries or reactionary technical "authorities" of the bourgeoisie. Some have even infiltrated the Communist Party and become "red experts." They take the people's money and do anti-people things. The traitor Liu Shaoqi insisted on relying on this bunch of riffraff, saying that capitalists are "politically reliable in more than ninety percent of cases." The walking capitalists in the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau, following their master's black instructions, implemented the organizational line of surrender and collusion, protecting, employing, and recruiting this bunch of bad people, forming a bourgeois engineering and technical team as an organizational guarantee for promoting the "crawling philosophy." They controlled the power of engineering technology and did everything possible to exclude workers from participating in the engineering and technical team, opposing the leadership of the working class. Worker engineers were never employed, and they had positions but no power. Major technical issues were never discussed with them but were taken to the bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities," who were only asked to do errands and odd jobs.

The traitor Liu Shaoqi's reliance on these bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" had another "reason": they said these people were "very capable," "understood technology," and even that their management capabilities exceeded those of the Communist Party members. Is this really the case? We have seen enough of it! For example, our country has its own high-strength steel wire, whose quality is stronger than imported steel wire from foreign countries. Workers proposed using our own products, but a slave who controlled technical power insisted on using foreign products. He even shamelessly said, "They have passed international certification and have export certificates, so they are reliable!" Look at this slave's face! He actually does not believe in our country's own products! This is what the traitor Liu Shaoqi praises as "very capable" and "understanding technology"!

Chairman Mao said, "The lowly are the wisest! The noble are the most foolish." Through the practice of building the bridge, we deeply feel that Chairman Mao's words are absolutely true! By kicking out a small group of bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities," we, the working class, followed Chairman Mao's self-reliance policy and walked our own path, and is it not the world-class bridge that we built? Let the "expert line" black goods of the traitor Liu Shaoqi and his ilk go to hell!

Technology Must Serve Proletarian Politics

Hu Baolin (diver) and Jiu Yuanyi (foreman):

The walking capitalists in the bridge engineering bureau, to promote the "crawling philosophy," vigorously opposed highlighting proletarian politics and vigorously advocated "technology first." Their tune was exactly the same as that of the traitor Liu Shaoqi. The traitor Liu Shaoqi said "technology decides everything," and they proposed the reactionary slogan of "technology decides, administrative commands, and the party committee guarantees." They also shouted, "Politics must follow technology," and "engineering is politics." This is extremely reactionary!

Can technology really "decide everything"? No, absolutely not. Chairman Mao teaches us: politics is the commander, the soul. "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." Only by highlighting proletarian politics, arming the mind with Mao Zedong Thought, raising proletarian political awareness, and having the thought of serving the people wholeheartedly, can boundless power be generated. A person without proletarian political enthusiasm, even if they have some technology, cannot exert their strength and cannot make a leap forward. As for a small group of politically reactionary bad guys, the more technology they have, the more conditions they have to sabotage. Therefore, technology serves politics. The same technology, when grasped by different classes, has different results. This shows that politics is the commander, and technology follows politics. Technology cannot "decide everything."

The walking capitalists in the bridge engineering bureau and their master, the traitor Liu Shaoqi, really advocate "technology first" and "technology decides everything"? Whoever believes this lie will be fooled. They play tricks with technology on the surface, but in reality, they are plotting political conspiracies. A small group of reactionary technical "authorities" and walking capitalists together usurped the power of the project, doing whatever they wanted. They held "technical assessments," setting up theoretical questions from foreign frameworks to make trouble for old workers. Many experienced foremen were discriminated against and excluded because they could not answer their foreign theoretical exam questions. More viciously, they tried to shift the attention of the broad masses of workers to technology, separating them from proletarian politics. In the engineering bureau, they also implemented the dictatorial system of reactionary technical "authorities." The walking capitalists in the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau announced that if party members and league members did not listen to the reactionary technical "authorities," they would be expelled from the party and league, showing how crazy they were! From these facts, it is clear that the walking capitalists in the bridge engineering bureau, the reactionary technical "authorities," and their master, the traitor Liu Shaoqi, emphasized technology as a cover, highlighting bourgeois politics as the real goal. "Technology decides everything" is essentially bourgeois politics deciding everything. They acted arbitrarily, saying one thing and doing another, not allowing workers to highlight proletarian politics, suppressing the initiative and creativity of workers, and implementing bourgeois dictatorship over workers. We have seen through this. They shout "technology first" with the purpose of opposing the highlighting of proletarian politics, opposing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, promoting the revisionist line, and carrying out counter-revolutionary restoration.

The walking capitalists in the bridge engineering bureau and those bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" talk about technology all the time, as if their technology is very advanced. In fact, they are at most some foreign frameworks. In practice, they are the most incompetent. For example, using ordinary diving equipment for deep-water operations, those reactionary technical "authorities" flipped through many foreign books but had no solution, saying that the "warning line" set by foreigners must not be exceeded, otherwise, people would be squeezed into meat patties by the water pressure. However, we workers thought of a new method and successfully carried out deep-water operations. The great creation of workers completely exposed the incompetence of reactionary technical "authorities."

The Working Class is the Master of Invention and Creation

Wang Chaozhu (worker engineer):

The walking capitalists in the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau colluded with bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" to promote the "crawling philosophy" of the traitor Liu Shaoqi. They praised American bridges, Japanese bridges, and Soviet revisionist bridges, and in the project, they often moved foreign frameworks. They were: "What foreigners have not said cannot be done, what foreign books have not written cannot be done," using this method to restrict the hands and feet of workers and not allowing workers to exert their creativity. Workers wanted to create and make a leap forward, and they would use their power to "control," use regulations and systems to "restrain," and even use big hats to "press." They used "safety" as a cover, spreading the fallacies of the biggest walking capitalist in the party, saying that "slow has its advantages, cars drive fast and crash, donkeys walk slow but are safe," and saying, "it doesn't matter if it's a bit slow."

What foreigners have not said, and what foreign books have not written, can we not do it? This is ridiculous! The world's largest and most famous Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, without a single "foreigner," was not built? In the bridge construction project, there were many things that "foreigners" had not said and that "foreign books" had not written, and we workers created them all. For example, when driving test piles, the situation was special, with no steam and no electricity, how to drive the piles? The reactionary technical "authorities" who rigidly followed foreign books said there was no solution. However, we workers thought of a solution. Could divers use ordinary equipment for deep-water operations? The reactionary technical "authorities" said, "It is written in foreign books that it is absolutely not possible." However, we workers were not intimidated by them, broke through the foreign frameworks, and achieved astonishing results in diving history. We should walk our own path and not always follow in others' footsteps. Following the "donkey-riding" method to always crawl and be content with backwardness, our country cannot control its own destiny, and that is the greatest instability. To catch up with others, we do not reject learning from foreign experience, but we must learn critically, combine it with reality, and learn what is useful to us. We resolutely oppose the "slave philosophy."

We workers do not buy foreign frameworks, and the reactionary technical "authorities" slander us, saying that workers "do not understand science" and that workers are "stupid." Who really does not understand science and who is stupid? Chairman Mao teaches us: "The correct thoughts of people can only come from social practice, only from the three kinds of social practice of production struggle, class struggle, and scientific experiment." He also said, "The most intelligent and talented are those with the most practical experience." In the bridge construction project, this truth was fully proven. Once, when installing the gantry crane, we workers used our brains to speed up the process, changing the old method of three merges into a new method of one merge. A reactionary technical "authority" insisted that this method had never been used before, calculating the "coefficient" according to foreign frameworks, saying it was not possible. He even pretended to be Zhuge Liang, saying to me, "If you do it this way, it will definitely collapse!" We did not listen to his nonsense, and the experiment was successful, completing the task half a month earlier than their "foreign method." Another time, when we were lifting the horizontal beam of the gantry crane, he calculated again, gesturing and saying this was not possible and that was not possible. I said, "If there is a problem, I will be beheaded!" When lifting, this "authority" who liked to "ride donkeys" was so scared that he hid far away, fearing for his life. When we quickly and safely lifted the beam, he silently hung his head and slipped away. The facts prove that the ones who do not understand science and are stupid are them, not the workers. Workers have Mao Zedong Thought and practical experience and can accomplish earth-shaking feats!

Those reactionary elements slander us workers, saying we "do not understand science" and "have no book knowledge." Right, we workers do not have those dead frameworks and foreign frameworks, and we do not have that slave mentality. We workers have the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, which is the best science in the world. The working class must lead science and technology. Money cannot corrupt the revolutionary will of workers

Han Guangyuan (waterway worker) and Liu Jiafa (carpenter):

The walking capitalists in our Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau, to promote the "crawling philosophy" and oppose self-reliance, also peddled the traitor Liu Shaoqi's "give first, take later" philosophy, vigorously promoting material incentives. They implemented many types of bonuses, such as "safety bonuses," "comprehensive bonuses," "innovation bonuses," "apprentice bonuses," "piecework bonuses," "cultural study bonuses," "saving bonuses," "practical training bonuses," and "technical study bonuses," totaling more than twenty types. In addition to giving bonuses, they also gave various material rewards, such as bedding, sheets, shirts, sportswear, basins, pens, notebooks, towels, etc., all of which became prizes.

The walking capitalists in our bridge engineering bureau "gave" us workers these money and goods, but what was their intention, and what did they want to "take" from us? Now it is very clear. The walking capitalists in our bridge engineering bureau implemented various bonuses and gave us workers this money and that money, all of which were poisonous drugs wrapped in sugar coats to corrupt workers' thoughts, all serving their sinister purposes:

First, they used these small favors to win people's hearts, making us worker brothers take the money and be deceived, saying they are "good secretaries" and "good experts," and be comfortably enslaved by them, consolidating their revisionist rule.

Second, they used money to instill bourgeois worldviews into us worker brothers, corrupting our souls, trying to shift our attention to a few dollars, squeezing out the time to study Chairman Mao's works, forgetting class struggle, forgetting revolution, and bowing our heads to become their tools for restoring capitalism.

Third, they tried to create discord among us worker brothers through various award activities, inciting our relationships, and destroying our unity.

In short, the traitor Liu Shaoqi and the walking capitalists in our bridge engineering bureau implemented this scheme to use economic means to make us become "slaves," ensuring the implementation of their counter-revolutionary revisionist line and sabotaging our socialist construction. If their plot succeeds, our country will change color. The traitor Liu Shaoqi and his ilk "gave" us a little money but wanted to "take" our entire red land from our hands. This plot is so sinister!

Chairman Mao recently taught us: "The working class is the leading class." We are old workers and should make Chairman Mao proud. We must study Chairman Mao's works even better, be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Together with worker brothers across the country, we will thoroughly eliminate the poison of the "crawling philosophy" spread by the traitor Liu Shaoqi and his ilk through various means.

The Power of Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line is Limitless

Zhou Yefu (representative of the PLA stationed at the bridge site):

The great leader Chairman Mao said: "Our country has 700 million people, and the working class is the leading class. We must fully exert the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all work." During the days of supporting the left in the bridge site, we saw with our own eyes the leading role of the working class who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao.

Take the construction of the pier, for example. A so-called "construction authority" said, "Even if workers exert their sky-high enthusiasm, it will take half a year." However, the broad masses of workers said, the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge is a self-reliant bridge, an anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist bridge, a "spirit bridge," and it must be built to make Chairman Mao proud and for the working class to shine! They would rather not sleep than not complete it before the opening. They said and did, treating the construction site as a battlefield, launching a revolutionary great criticism, severely criticizing the traitor Liu Shaoqi and his agent in the Ministry of Railways for promoting a set of counter-revolutionary revisionist scientific and technological lines in the bridge construction. The more they criticized, the higher their political awareness; the more they criticized, the greater their revolutionary enthusiasm; the more they criticized, the less they cared about difficulties. Due to the efforts of the broad masses of workers, the majestic pier was finally completed before the opening. This pier, which is as high as a 25-story building, was completed in just 27 days.

The history of the completion of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge is the history of the working class adhering to Chairman Mao's self-reliance policy and overcoming the "crawling philosophy" of the traitor Liu Shaoqi. The completion of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge deeply illustrates that only with the leadership of the working class can Chairman Mao's self-reliance policy be implemented. In the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of workers seized the power of a small group of walking capitalists and bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" in the bridge engineering bureau, criticized the revisionist line, and the wisdom and creativity of the worker masses were fully exerted. Chairman Mao said, "Among all things in the world, man is the most precious. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any miracle in the world can be created." Once the working class grasps the great Mao Zedong Thought and implements Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, any miracle in the world can be created.

专栏：七亿人民都来做批判家

    南京长江大桥工人狠批大叛徒刘少奇“爬行哲学”
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“我们不能走世界各国技术发展的老路，跟在别人后面一步一步地爬行。”世界桥梁史上的伟大创举、我国南京长江大桥的建成，放射着毛泽东思想的光辉，证明毛主席的无产阶级科技路线的无比正确，也充分显示了以毛泽东思想武装起来的我国工人阶级敢于攀险峰、闯新路的革命英雄气概。同时，在南京长江大桥建成的事实面前，也宣告了叛徒刘少奇推行修正主义科技路线的“爬行哲学”的彻底破产。请看，一列列隆隆的火车飞奔在雄伟的南京长江大桥上，叛徒刘少奇之流那些奴颜婢膝，崇洋仿外，完全跪倒在“洋人”脚下，只会爬行的“洋奴”，还不乖乖地认输吗？事实就是这样无情！
    为了清除叛徒刘少奇推行的修正主义科技路线的流毒，南京长江大桥工人代表最近开会，批判了他所推行的“爬行哲学”。
    现把参加这次批判会的大桥工人同志的发言，摘要发表。
    毛主席的自力更生方针万岁
    李绍峰（老工人出身的革命干部）：
    毛主席教导我们说：“我们是主张自力更生的。我们希望有外援，但是我们不能依赖它，我们依靠自己的努力，依靠全体军民的创造力。”
    毛主席的自力更生方针是我们国家建设唯一正确的方针。可是叛徒刘少奇之流，妄图复辟资本主义，公开与毛主席的方针唱反调。他们在大桥建设上推销了一整套的修正主义黑货，跟着“洋人”屁股后面转，大肆宣扬“爬行哲学”。叛徒刘少奇胡说：“人家搞高的、快的，我们就暂时搞低的、慢的。”他在铁道部的代理人狂妄地说：“自力更生是自己给自己出难题。”真是反动透顶！
    “自力更生是自己给自己出难题”吗？告诉修正主义的老爷们，你们说对了。中国工人阶级要改变国家的一穷二白的面貌，就是要干，要革命，要千方百计地建设社会主义。中国工人阶级立志不再受帝、修、反的欺侮，就是有勇气，迎着困难上！“明知山有虎，偏向虎山行”，不达目的，誓不罢休！我们建设南京长江大桥，就是自己动手，创造发明。我们绝不象你们那样，拜倒在“洋人”脚下，甘愿搞低的、慢的，安心爬行。
    叛徒刘少奇之流在科技路线上推行“爬行哲学”的目的是什么？说穿了，就是为他们复辟资本主义服务。他们害怕中国迅速强大起来，无产阶级专政越来越巩固，破坏了他们的复辟资本主义美梦。如果搞“低的、慢的”，不“自己出难题”，长期处于落后状态，他们就好下手了。问题很明白：我们要贯彻自力更生方针，他们要推行“爬行哲学”，这是一场两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。我们工人阶级决不能上当。我们坚决听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平”，“有自立于世界民族之林的能力。”现在我们自己设计、自己施工、自行安装的世界上第一流的南京长江大桥又快又好地造起来了！这里没有用一个“洋人”，没有用洋设备，就是靠“自力更生”，我们高呼：毛主席的自力更生方针万岁！
    有工人阶级领导　才能自力更生
    宋传富（装吊工）、罗效华（混凝土工）：
    搞社会主义建设，是依靠工人阶级，大搞群众运动，还是依靠资产阶级，走“专家路线”，这是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的一个重要问题。叛徒刘少奇鼓吹“爬行哲学”，破坏毛主席“自力更生”方针，拚命推行“专家路线”，反对工人阶级领导，反对大搞群众运动。他胡说什么“不要以为依靠工人阶级就没有问题”，“特别要依靠厂长、工程师和技师”。他还叫嚷：“总工程师……对企业的技术工作负全部责任”。南京长江大桥工程处的走资派，一股劲儿跟着主子屁股后面转，极力实行“专家路线”，一切都是“专家”、“权威”说了算，把我们工人阶级排斥在外。有个走资派竟蛮横地说：“在技术上，如果违犯‘权威’规定，是党员要开除党籍，是团员要开除团籍，是群众要受处分。”使工人群众的聪明才智受到很大压制，工人群众的革命积极性受到很大打击。
    按理说，工人是创造社会财富的主人，工人整天在工地上风里来，雨里去，对工程技术最熟悉，最有实践知识，可是那些资产阶级“权威”就是不听工人的意见。工人认为该干的，偏不叫干；不该干的，偏要你干。就拿某号桥墩打桩来说吧，“专家”决定不射水干打桩，工人认为这样干打，既难打，又要断桩。大桥工程处的走资派还是要工人按“专家”的决定办，一连打断了二十几根桩。我们工人看了真心疼，于是，就把意见往上提，那知走资派还是找一批“专家”、“权威”研究。那些装满一脑袋资产阶级思想的反动技术“权威”，又能研究出什么道道来？他们胡扯什么“多打多断，少打少断，不打不断”，还不知羞耻地说：“断桩是正常现象，外国书上有的。”有个走资派对这些不值一驳的谬论，不但不敢吭一声，反而对工人说：“今天‘权威’都在这儿坐着呢！工程师决定的很好嘛，你们要听工程师的。”我们工人一听火了，指着他们的鼻子大声说：“好！让你们来干。如果不断桩，才算你们真有本事！”直驳得他哑口无言。工人阶级就是这个脾气，凡是不符合毛泽东思想的，就是要顶，砍掉脑袋也不怕！但是由于那时工程技术的领导大权掌握在那些资产阶级老爷们手里，对工人实行资产阶级专政，压制不同意见，有很多好的意见被扼杀了。
    这些神气活现、不可一世的“专家”、“权威”，又是一些什么货色呢？他们中间有不少人不是国民党反动派的残渣余孽，就是资产阶级的反动技术“权威”。有的人还混进共产党，成了“红色专家”。他们拿着人民的钱，干着反人民的事。叛徒刘少奇硬是要依靠这一批乌七八糟的人物，他胡说什么资本家“百分之九十几政治上是可靠的”。大桥工程处的走资派按照主子的黑指示，推行了招降纳叛、结党营私的组织路线，包庇、重用、收罗了这批坏人，组成了一套资产阶级的工程技术班子，作为他们推行“爬行哲学”的组织保证。他们掌握了工程技术大权，千方百计排挤工人参加工程技术队伍，反对工人阶级领导。工人工程师从不被重用，有职无权。重大的技术问题，根本不找他们，而去找资产阶级反动技术“权威”，让他们做些跑腿打杂的事。
    叛徒刘少奇重用这些资产阶级反动技术“权威”，还有一个“理由”，说他们“很能作事”，“既懂得技术”，“甚至他们的管理能力超过我们的共产党员。”果真是这样吗？我们对这一点是领教够了！譬如，我国有自己制造的高强度钢丝，质量比外国进口的钢丝强度高，工人提出要用自己制造的，有个掌握技术大权的洋奴才，偏偏不准用，硬要用外国的。他还厚着脸皮说：“人家是经过国际鉴定的，有出口证，靠得住！”看，这一副十足的奴才相！居然不相信我们国家自己的产品！这就是叛徒刘少奇所吹捧的“很能作事”，“懂得技术”！
    毛主席说：“卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢”。通过建设大桥的实践，我们深深感到毛主席这句话千真万确！踢开了一小撮资产阶级反动技术“权威”，我们工人阶级遵照毛主席“自力更生”方针，走自己的道路，不是把世界第一流的大桥建成了吗？让叛徒刘少奇之流的“专家路线”黑货见鬼去吧！
    技术必须为无产阶级政治服务
    胡宝林（潜水工）、酒远义（领工员）：
    大桥工程处的走资派为了推行“爬行哲学”，极力反对突出无产阶级政治，拚命鼓吹“技术第一”。他们的腔调和叛徒刘少奇一模一样。叛徒刘少奇说“技术决定一切”，他们就提出“技术决定，行政命令，党委保证”的反动口号。还叫嚷“政治要落在技术上”，“工程就是政治”。真是反动透顶！
    技术真能“决定一切”吗？不，绝对不能。毛主席教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂。“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”只有突出无产阶级政治，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，提高无产阶级政治觉悟，有了全心全意为人民服务的思想，才能产生无穷无尽的力量。一个人没有无产阶级政治热情，就是有点技术，也使不出劲来，不能跃进。至于政治上反动的一小撮坏家伙，越是有技术，就越有条件搞破坏。因此，技术是为政治服务的，同样的技术，掌握在不同阶级手里，结果就不同。这就说明政治是统帅，技术是跟着政治跑的，技术决不能“决定一切”。
    大桥工程处的走资派和他们的主子叛徒刘少奇，真是主张“技术第一”、“技术决定一切”吗？谁要相信这个鬼话，那就要上当。他们口头上玩的技术把戏，实际上搞的是政治阴谋。一小撮反动技术“权威”和走资派一起篡夺了工程大权，爱怎么干就怎么干。他们举行什么“技术考核”，出一些洋框框里的理论题目，来和老工人为难。不少有丰富经验的老师傅，因为答不上他们的洋教条考试题目，被歧视、排挤。更恶毒的是，他们妄想把广大工人的注意力都吸引到技术方面来，脱离无产阶级政治。在工程处，还实行反动技术“权威”独裁的制度，大桥工程处走资派宣布党员、团员如果不听反动技术“权威”的话，就要开除党籍、团籍，说明他们疯狂到什么地步！从这些事实来看，大桥工程处走资派和反动技术“权威”，以及他们的主子叛徒刘少奇，强调技术是假，突出资产阶级政治是真，“技术决定一切”，实质上就是资产阶级政治决定一切。他们横行霸道，说一不二，不准工人突出无产阶级政治，压制工人的积极性和创造性，对工人实行资产阶级专政。这一点我们看透了，他们大叫“技术第一”，目的就是反对突出无产阶级政治，反对毛主席的革命路线，推行修正主义路线，搞反革命复辟。
    大桥工程处的走资派和那些资产阶级反动技术“权威”，张口技术，闭口技术，好象他们的技术高明得很，其实，他们充其量不过是一些本本上的洋教条。在实践中，他们最没有本事。比如说，用一般潜水装置搞深水作业，那些反动技术“权威”翻了好多洋书，毫无办法，还说绝对不能超过“洋人”规定的“警戒线”，要不，人就被水的压力挤成肉饼。可是，我们工人想出新办法，胜利地进行了深水作业。工人的伟大创举，完全暴露了反动技术“权威”的无能。
    工人阶级是创造发明的主人
    王超柱（工人工程师）：
    南京长江大桥工程处的走资派，勾结资产阶级反动技术“权威”，推行叛徒刘少奇的“爬行哲学”。他们吹捧什么美国桥、日本桥、苏修桥，在工程中动不动就搬洋教条，他们是：“洋人没说过的不能动，洋书没写过的不能搞”，拿这个办法框住工人的手脚，不准工人发挥创造性。工人要创造，要跃进，他们就凭权来“管”，以规章制度来“卡”，甚至拿大帽子来“压”。他们用“安全”作幌子，散布党内另一个最大的走资派的“慢也有慢的好处，汽车开得快，摔就摔死了，骑毛驴走得慢，但却稳当”的谬论，胡说“慢一点不要紧”。
    “洋人”没说的，“洋书”没写的，我们就不能做到吗？真是笑话！世界桥梁史上罕见的、全国最大的南京长江大桥，没有一个“洋人”，不是造成了吗？在造桥的工程中，有许多事情，“洋人”没说过，“洋书”没写过，我们工人都创造出来了。比方说，打试桩时，情况特殊，没有蒸气，没有电，怎么打桩？死搬“洋书”的反动技术“权威”说没办法。可是，我们工人就想出了办法。潜水员用一般装置能不能搞深水作业？反动技术“权威”说：“洋书上写着，绝对不行。”可是，我们工人没有被他们吓唬住，冲破了洋框框，取得了潜水史上的惊人成就。我们应该走自己的路，不能老踩着别人的脚印跟着跑。按照“骑毛驴”的办法老是爬行，甘心落后，我们国家掌握不住自己的命运，那就是最大的不稳当。为了赶上人家，我们并不拒绝学习外国经验，但是要批判地学，要结合实际学，要学习对我们有用的东西。我们坚决反对“洋奴哲学”。
    我们工人就是不买洋教条的账，反动技术“权威”就胡说工人“不懂科学”，说工人“蠢”。到底是谁不懂科学，谁蠢？毛主席教导我们：“人的正确思想，只能从社会实践中来，只能从社会的生产斗争、阶级斗争和科学实验这三项实践中来。”又说：“最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”在建桥工程中，完全证明了这个真理。有一次，安装门式吊机，我们工人动脑筋加快速度，把三次合拢的老办法改为一次合拢的新办法。有个反动技术“权威”硬说过去没有用过这个办法，根据洋教条计算“系数”，说不行。他还冒充“诸葛亮”，对我说：“你们这样搞，肯定要倒的！”我们不理他那一套，试验成功了，比他们的“洋办法”提前半个月完成任务。还有一次，我们吊门式吊机的横梁时，他又计算一通，指手划脚，说这也不行，那也不行。我说：“要是有问题，砍脑袋我去！”吊的时候，这个爱“骑毛驴”的“权威”吓得躲在老远，生怕送了命，等我们把大梁迅速安全地吊了上去，他哑口无言地搭拉着脑袋溜走了。事实证明，最不懂得科学、最蠢的是他们，不是工人。工人有毛泽东思想，有实践经验，能够做出惊天动地的事业来！
    那些反动家伙诬蔑我们工人“不懂科学”，“没有书本知识”。对了，我们工人就是没有那些死教条、洋框框，没有那个奴隶劲。我们工人有战无不胜的毛泽东思想，这是世界上最好最好的科学。我们工人阶级必须领导科学技术。金钱腐蚀不了工人的革命意志韩光远（水道工）、刘家法（木工）：我们南京长江大桥工程处的走资派，为了推行“爬行哲学”，反对自力更生，他们还贩运了叛徒刘少奇“将欲取之，必先予之”的市侩哲学，大搞物质刺激。他们大搞奖金，就是一个突出的例子。
    我们大桥工程处的走资派，搞了很多名目的奖金，如“安全奖”、“综合奖”、“革新奖”、“带徒弟奖”、“计件奖”、“文化学习奖”、“节约奖”、“劳动实习奖”、“技术学习奖”，等等，不下二十多种。除去发奖金之外，还发了名目繁多的实物奖，如被面、被单、衬衣、球衣、脸盆、钢笔、笔记本、毛巾，等等，都成了奖品。
    我们大桥工程处的走资派“予”了我们工人这些钱和物，究竟他们安的是什么心，要向我们“取”些什么呢？现在看得很清楚了。我们大桥工程处的走资派搞这样奖、那样奖，发给我们工人这笔钱、那笔钱，都是包着糖衣腐蚀工人思想的毒药，都是为了妄图实现其不可告人的目的服务的：
    第一、他们以这点小恩小惠笼络人心，让我们工人兄弟拿了钱，受蒙蔽，说他们是“好书记”、“好专家”，“舒舒服服”地被他们奴役，以巩固他们的修正主义统治。
    第二、他们通过钞票，给我们工人兄弟灌输资产阶级世界观，腐蚀我们的灵魂，妄图把我们工人兄弟的注意力吸引到为着几个钱上，挤掉学习毛主席著作的时间，忘记阶级斗争，忘记革命，俯首帖耳地做他们复辟资本主义的工具。
    第三、他们还妄图通过繁多的评奖活动，在我们工人兄弟之间制造不和，挑拨我们的关系，破坏我们的团结。
    总之，叛徒刘少奇和我们大桥工程处的走资派搞这一套，就是为了利用经济手段，让我们做“洋奴”，以保证推行其反革命修正主义路线，破坏我们社会主义建设。如果让他们的阴谋得逞，我们的国家就要变色。叛徒刘少奇之流“予”我们一点钱，而要从我们手中“取”去整个红色江山，这个阴谋多么毒辣啊！
    毛主席最近教导我们：“工人阶级是领导阶级”。我们是老工人，应该为毛主席争气。我们要更好地学习毛主席著作，无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，和全国工人兄弟一起，彻底清除叛徒刘少奇之流利用种种手段所散布的“爬行哲学”的流毒。
    毛主席革命路线威力无穷
    周业全（解放军驻大桥工地代表）：
    伟大领袖毛主席说：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。”在大桥工地支左的日子里，我们亲眼看到了无限忠于毛主席的工人阶级的领导作用。
    以建造桥头堡来说吧。有个所谓“建筑权威”说：“就是工人发挥了冲天的干劲，也要半年时间。”可是广大工人说，南京长江大桥是自力更生的大桥，是反帝、反修的大桥，是“志气桥”，一定要为毛主席争气，为工人阶级争光！宁愿不睡觉，也要在通车前完成。他们说到做到，把工地当战场，开展革命的大批判，狠批叛徒刘少奇及其在铁道部的代理人，在大桥建设上所推行的一整套反革命修正主义科技路线。越批，政治觉悟越高；越批，革命干劲越大；越批，就越把困难看得不在话下。由于广大工人的努力，巍峨的桥头堡终于在通车前完工。这个有二十五层楼高的桥头堡，只用了二十七天时间就完成了。
    南京长江大桥建成的历史，是工人阶级坚持毛主席“自力更生”方针，战胜叛徒刘少奇“爬行哲学”的历史。南京长江大桥的建成，深刻地说明了只有工人阶级领导，才能贯彻毛主席“自力更生”方针。在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，广大工人夺了大桥工程处一小撮走资派和资产阶级反动技术“权威”的大权，批判了修正主义路线，工人群众的聪明才智得到了充分发挥。毛主席说：“世间一切事物中，人是第一个可宝贵的。在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来。”工人阶级一经掌握了伟大的毛泽东思想，贯彻毛主席的革命路线，任何人间奇迹都可以创造出来。
