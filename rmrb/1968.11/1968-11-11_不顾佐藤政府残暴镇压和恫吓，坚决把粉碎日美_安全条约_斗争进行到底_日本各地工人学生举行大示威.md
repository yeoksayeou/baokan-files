In defiance of the brutal suppression and intimidation by the Sato government, workers and students in various parts of Japan held large-scale demonstrations on November 7 to resolutely carry forward the struggle to smash the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and demand the return of Okinawa.

New China News Agency, November 8: Tokyo — Workers and progressive students in Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Hiroshima, and other cities held large-scale rallies and demonstrations on November 7 to oppose the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and demand the return of Okinawa.

This struggle by workers and youth against U.S. imperialism, in defiance of the Sato reactionary government's brutal suppression and intimidation of the people, was a resolute and courageous act. The demonstrators bravely fought against the reactionary government's armed police.

In Tokyo, from the afternoon of November 7 until late at night, about 6,000 young workers and students held rallies and demonstrations in three different locations within the city. They engaged in fierce battles with reactionary police in front of the Prime Minister's official residence. During the rallies, young workers and students strongly protested against U.S. imperialism's occupation of Okinawa and its use of Okinawa as a base for invading Vietnam. They condemned the Revisionist group led by Komoto for disrupting the Japanese people's struggle to recover Okinawa and for enthusiastically supporting bourgeois parliamentary elections under the rule of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries in Okinawa.

After the rallies, the participants, holding banners reading "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought" and many red flags, sang "The Internationale" and marched proudly and determinedly.

The Sato reactionary government, terrified by the demonstrators, deployed more than 7,500 armed police and a large number of plainclothes agents around the Prime Minister's official residence, the Diet building, the U.S. Embassy, the Japanese "Foreign Ministry," and the Tokyo "Metropolitan Police Department" on November 7. They also mobilized a large number of armored vehicles and water cannons to brutally suppress the demonstrators, fully exposing the reactionaries' ferocious nature and the paper tiger's weak essence.

The patriotic students who first arrived at the Prime Minister's official residence bravely threw stones and swung sticks to destroy the police barricades amid shouts. The police used tear gas and water cannons in an attempt to suppress the students' just struggle, but the students continued their fight with unyielding spirit.

In Osaka, on the evening of November 7, about 1,000 young workers and students held a rally in Tennoji, Osaka City, expressing their resolute support for the Okinawan people's struggle against U.S. imperialism's rule over Okinawa. They vowed to strengthen unity among the people and resolutely carry forward the struggle to smash the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

After the rally, the participants held a massive demonstration. The demonstrators, holding red flags, repeatedly shouted slogans to smash the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and overthrow U.S. imperialism, and sang "The Internationale."

The brave demonstrators, undeterred by the threats of reactionary police, fearlessly carried out the demonstrations to the end.

In Kyoto and Hiroshima, rallies and demonstrations against U.S. imperialism were also held on November 7.

　　不顾佐藤政府残暴镇压和恫吓，坚决把粉碎日美“安全条约”斗争进行到底
　　日本各地工人学生举行大示威
    新华社八日讯　东京消息：日本东京、大阪、京都、广岛等城市的青年工人和进步学生，七日分别举行粉碎日美“安全条约”和要求收回冲绳的大规模集会和示威游行。
    这次工人和青年学生的反美爱国斗争，是在不顾佐藤反动政府对人民进行残暴镇压和恫吓的情况下举行的。示威群众同佐藤反动政府的武装警察进行了英勇的搏斗。
    在东京，从七日下午直到深夜，青年工人和学生共六千多人，分别在市内三个地方举行了集会和示威游行，并在首相官邸同反动警察进行了激烈的搏斗。在集会上，青年工人和学生强烈抗议美帝国主义占领冲绳和利用冲绳作为侵略越南的基地，谴责宫本修正主义集团破坏日本人民收复冲绳的斗争，热衷于在美日反动派统治下在冲绳搞资产阶级议会选举。
    会后，与会者高举“毛泽东思想万岁”的横幅标语和许多面红旗，高唱《国际歌》，雄赳赳气昂昂地举行了示威游行。
    被示威群众吓破了胆的日本佐藤反动政府，七日在首相官邸、国会大厦、美国大使馆、日本“外务省”和东京“警视厅”附近布置了七千五百多名武装警察和大批便衣特务，出动了大批装甲车、水龙车等，对示威群众进行残酷镇压，充分暴露了反动派的狰狞面目和纸老虎的虚弱本质。
    首先到达首相官邸前的爱国学生，在呐喊声中英勇地投掷石头和挥动木棍来毁坏警察设置的路障。警察使用催泪弹和水龙，企图把学生的正义斗争镇压下去，但是，学生们以不屈不挠的战斗精神继续进行了战斗。
    在大阪，七日晚上，一千名青年工人和学生在大阪市天王寺举行集会，表示坚决支持冲绳人民反对美帝统治冲绳的英勇斗争，加强人民之间的团结，坚决把粉碎日美“安全条约”的斗争进行到底。
    会后，与会者举行了声势浩大的示威游行。示威者高举红旗，一再高呼粉碎日美“安全条约”和打倒美帝等口号，并高唱《国际歌》。
    英勇的示威群众，不顾反动警察的威胁，毫不畏惧地把游行示威进行到底。
    在京都和广岛等城市，七日也举行了反美集会和示威游行。
