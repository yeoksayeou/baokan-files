In the 1920s, our great leader Chairman Mao had repeatedly come to Anshan, descended into the mines, slept in grass huts, and had heart-to-heart talks with us workers, teaching us that we must resolutely struggle against the capitalists. He personally initiated, organized, and led the Anshan Railway and Mining Workers' Great Strike. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts, the revolutionary movement of Anshan workers burned more and more fiercely.

The traitor Liu Shaoqi has always harbored hatred and suppressed our workers' revolutionary movement. Two days before the Anshan Railway and Mining Workers' Great Strike, this guy sneaked into Anshan. After arriving in Anshan, he threw himself into the arms of the capitalists, frequenting banquets and brothels, and becoming thick as thieves with the bloodsuckers. He willingly became the capitalists' faithful running dog. He maliciously slandered the Anshan workers' revolutionary movement, falsely accusing it of being "premature," and defaming the workers' strike as "reckless" and "adventurism," doing everything he could to obstruct our strike. We Anshan workers immediately saw that Liu Shaoqi was no good, and no one listened to his lies. We firmly followed Chairman Mao's wise decisions and carried out the strike struggle.

The strike began. Chairman Mao taught us, "Revolution is an insurrection, an act of violence by one class over another." Against the bourgeoisie's counter-revolutionary rule, our working class has always been determined to smash it and overthrow it. Liu Shaoqi hated our working class's revolutionary actions so much that he gnashed his teeth. He couldn't wait to wield the "civilized strike" stick, scolding the workers not to "cause trouble," shouting to "maintain order," and tying the workers' hands in every way. Liu Shaoqi's so-called "civilized strike" was nothing but kneeling at the capitalists' feet, trying to "build relationships" and "cultivate virtue" with the capitalists, betraying and selling out the fundamental interests of our working class.

During the fierce strike struggle, Liu Shaoqi was very eager to engage in "peaceful negotiations" with the capitalists, repeatedly lowering the conditions for resuming work. He also organized a surveillance team, specifically tasked with spying on, restricting, and prohibiting our workers' political struggles, attempting to lead the political strike, personally initiated, organized, and led by Chairman Mao, down the path of economism. What was particularly intolerable was that he dared to brazenly cut four items and alter five items from the "seventeen demands" for the strike personally drafted by Chairman Mao for the Anshan workers, blatantly selling out the fundamental interests of our working class. However, Liu Shaoqi's betrayal activities were met with resolute opposition from the broad revolutionary workers. We remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, persisted in the struggle, and finally achieved a great victory.

In 1922, when the great strike achieved a great victory, we Anshan workers, following Chairman Mao's wise instructions, prepared to ride the revolutionary momentum and push the workers' revolutionary movement to new heights. However, Liu Shaoqi, the son and grandson of the bourgeoisie, insisted that we obey the foremen's "legitimate commands" and produce more coal, clean coal, and good coal for the capitalists. He also concocted a reactionary theory of "exploitation is beneficial" for the capitalists. He said, "The capitalists' profits are like water in a bottle, the more you pour out, the less there is, if the water is too low, the capitalists have no profit," "We should let the water in the capitalists' bottle slowly flow out, and our workers' lives will improve too." This is completely the tone of landlords, capitalists, and other bloodsuckers, a philosophy of cannibalism that maintains the system of exploitation. Here, the ugly face of the great scoundrel Liu Shaoqi has been completely exposed! But our Anshan workers' bloody history has given Liu Shaoqi a resounding slap in the face. We Anshan workers deeply understand that the bottle of the capitalists is not filled with water, but with the blood and tears of our working class. If we do not overthrow the bourgeoisie's reactionary rule, we have no way out, no future.

The great scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, because of his betrayal, was highly appreciated by imperialism and capitalists. The former deputy manager of Pingxiang Mine, Shu XiuTai, once presented Liu Shaoqi with a "labor-capital cooperation" banner. Even after liberation, this old bloodsucker still wrote a letter to Liu Shaoqi expressing his "gratitude": "In the past four years of living in Pingxiang Coal Mine, whenever there were difficult times, I was always helped by you and Comrade Li Lisan to solve difficulties and provide guidance. I still remember it with gratitude." This is the ironclad evidence that Liu Shaoqi, who was called the "leader of the workers' movement," was actually a scoundrel!

For a long time, the great scoundrel Liu Shaoqi has appropriated the credit of heaven as his own, dressing himself up as the "leader" of the Anshan workers' revolutionary movement, creating conditions for his usurpation of the party, usurpation of power, and restoration of capitalism. However, the great and decisive victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat has completely stripped Liu Shaoqi of the mask of the "leader of the workers' movement," and his true face as a great scoundrel has been fully exposed in broad daylight.

    真工贼　假“领袖”
    安源煤矿革命委员会
    早在二十年代，我们的伟大领袖毛主席曾经多次来到安源，下矿井，睡草棚，和我们工人促膝谈心，教导我们必须同资本家进行坚决斗争，并亲自发动、组织和领导了安源路矿工人大罢工。在毛主席的光辉思想指引下，安源工人革命运动的烈火越烧越猛。
    刘少奇这个大叛徒一贯仇视和压制我们工人阶级的革命运动。在安源路矿工人大罢工的前两天，这个家伙鬼鬼祟祟地溜进了安源。他到安源以后，一头栽到资本家怀里，出没于宴会花楼，和吸血鬼打得火热，甘心情愿地做资本家的忠实走狗。他对安源工人革命运动信口雌黄，横加指责，胡说什么“罢工条件还不成熟”，污蔑工人罢工是“铤而走险”，是“冒险主义”等等，极力阻挠我们举行罢工。我们安源工人一看就知道刘少奇不是个好东西，谁都不听他的鬼话，仍然坚定地遵照毛主席的英明决策，举行了罢工斗争。
    罢工开始了。毛主席教导我们说：“革命是暴动，是一个阶级推翻一个阶级的暴烈的行动。”对于资产阶级的反革命统治，我们工人阶级从来就是要冲击它，推翻它。刘少奇对我们工人阶级的革命行动，恨得直咬牙。他迫不及待地挥舞着“文明罢工”的大棒，训斥工人“不要瞎搞乱动”，叫喊要“维持秩序”，百般地束缚工人的手脚。刘少奇的所谓“文明罢工”，说穿了，就是跪倒在资本家的脚下，跟资本家搞什么“联络感情，涵养德性”，背叛和出卖我们工人阶级的根本利益。
    在轰轰烈烈的罢工斗争中，刘少奇非常热衷于同资本家搞“和平谈判”，一再降低复工条件。他还组织一种监察队，专门负责侦察、束缚和禁止我们工人的政治斗争，力图把毛主席亲自发动、组织和领导的这场政治大罢工，引向经济主义的邪途。特别令人不能容忍的是，他竟狗胆包天，把毛主席亲手为安源工人拟定的罢工“十七条”要求砍去了四条，篡改了五条，明目张胆地出卖我们工人阶级的根本利益。但是，刘少奇的叛卖活动，遭到广大革命工人的坚决反对。我们牢记毛主席的教导，坚持斗争，终于取得重大胜利。
    在大罢工取得重大胜利的一九二二年，我们安源工人遵照毛主席的英明指示，准备乘革命的大好形势，把工人革命运动推向新高潮。但是，刘少奇这个资产阶级的孝子贤孙，却硬要我们服从工头的“正当指挥”，为资本家“多出煤，出净煤，出好煤”。他还为资本家编造一种“剥削有功”的反动谬论。他胡说什么“资本家的利润好比瓶子里的水，倒一点就少一点，水太低了，资本家无利可图”，“我们应尽力让资本家瓶子里的水慢慢淌出来，我们工人的生活也就好了。”这完全是地主、资本家等吸血鬼的腔调，是维护剥削制度的吃人哲学。在这里，大工贼刘少奇的丑恶嘴脸，已经赤裸裸地暴露出来了！但是，我们安源工人的血泪史，给了刘少奇一记最响亮的耳光。我们安源工人深深懂得，资本家瓶子里装的根本不是水，而是我们工人阶级的血和泪，不推翻资产阶级的反动统治，我们就没有活路，就没有出头之日。
    大工贼刘少奇由于叛卖有功，深得帝国主义和资本家的欣赏。当年萍矿的伪副矿长舒修泰，就曾把一面“劳资合作”锦旗赠送给刘少奇。直到解放以后，这个老吸血鬼还写信给刘少奇述说“感激”之情：“前在萍乡煤矿居住四年，每逢艰难时会，多蒙钧座与立三先生排难解纷，指示机宜，至今追想，犹切感激。”这就是刘少奇名为“工人运动领袖”，实为工贼的铁证！
    长期以来，大工贼刘少奇贪天之功为己功，把自己打扮成为安源工人革命运动的“领袖”，为他篡党、篡政、复辟资本主义创造条件。但是，无产阶级文化大革命的伟大的、决定性的胜利，完全剥去了刘少奇身上披着的“工人运动领袖”的画皮，他的大工贼的真面目完全暴露在光天化日之下。
