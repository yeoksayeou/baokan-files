Nationwide military and civilians are seriously studying the latest instructions of Great Leader Chairman Mao. They solemnly celebrate the re-publication of Chairman Mao's epoch-making brilliant document. They enthusiastically acclaim the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

Inspired by the great call of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, the hundreds of millions of military and civilians of our country are advancing bravely. With hearts filled with great excitement, they enthusiastically acclaim the publication of Great Leader Chairman Mao's latest instruction: "Historical experience is worth noting. One line, one viewpoint, should be repeatedly discussed. It is not enough to discuss it with a few people; it should be known to the broad revolutionary masses." They enthusiastically acclaim the re-publication of Chairman Mao's epoch-making Marxist-Leninist document, "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China," and the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

The hundreds of millions of military and civilians have studied Chairman Mao's latest instruction with great seriousness. They have reviewed Chairman Mao's report at the Seventh Plenum of the Second Central Committee. They have enthusiastically discussed the important editorials of the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily, "Seriously Study the History of the Struggle Between the Two Lines," and have been greatly inspired and educated. They unanimously believe that Chairman Mao's report at the Seventh Plenum of the Second Central Committee is a guiding beacon for the revolutionary people of the whole country to advance from victory to victory. It is a great program for establishing and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and building socialism. It is a sharp ideological weapon against revisionism and against the "left" and "right" opportunist lines in the entire transitional period. At this time of seizing the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution, it is of great significance to re-study this brilliant document. They unanimously expressed that they would definitely follow the teachings of Great Leader Chairman Mao, seriously study the historical experience of the struggle between the two lines within the Party, further arm themselves with Chairman Mao's theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, raise the awareness of the struggle between the two lines to a new height, thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist ideology, thoroughly settle the accounts with the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes of betraying the Party and the country, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully implement the various combat tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenum of the Twelfth Central Committee, and carry the Cultural Revolution to the end!

Chairman Mao's latest instruction and the re-publication of Chairman Mao's report at the Seventh Plenum of the Second Central Committee have quickly spread throughout the country. The hundreds of millions of military and civilians are in high spirits. In the capital Beijing, in the industrial cities of Shanghai and Tianjin, hundreds of thousands of military and civilians have poured into the streets and squares, drumming and beating gongs, setting off firecrackers, and holding various celebrations throughout the night. In the cities where the revolutionary committees of the provinces and autonomous regions are located, and in other large, medium, and small cities, tens of thousands of military and civilians have carried giant portraits of Chairman Mao and banners with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, gathering in streets and squares, holding grand meetings and parades. The good news has reached the vast rural areas, pastures, mountain fortresses, and fishing villages of the motherland. The poor and lower-middle peasants have gathered around the radio and under the loudspeakers, listening again and again to Chairman Mao's latest instructions and brilliant documents. The heroic sons and daughters of Shaoshan, Jinggangshan, Zunyi, Yan'an, and Anshan have listened to the broadcast, singing and dancing, enthusiastically praising the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The border guards stationed in the grasslands of Inner Mongolia and the Pamir Plateau have formed propaganda teams overnight, mounted their horses, braved the wind and snow, and quickly spread the good news to their brother nationalities. The officers and soldiers stationed at the coastal frontiers have held celebrations after listening to the broadcast, enthusiastically praising Chairman Mao's wise leadership and the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The hundreds of millions of military and civilians have unanimously agreed that the re-publication of Great Leader Chairman Mao's latest instruction and Chairman Mao's report at the Seventh Plenum of the Second Central Committee is a great strategic deployment of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. Chairman Mao's latest instruction and Chairman Mao's report at the Seventh Plenum of the Second Central Committee are great programs for deepening the struggle between the two lines, powerful ideological weapons for greatly raising the awareness of the struggle between the two lines among the hundreds of millions of revolutionary people and thoroughly criticizing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. The history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party fully proves that Chairman Mao's theory, line, policies, and tactics of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, which were established at the Seventh Plenum of the Second Central Committee and later enriched and developed, are absolutely correct.

Revolutionary masses in various places unanimously believe that Chairman Mao's report at the Seventh Plenum of the Second Central Committee and Chairman Mao's other brilliant works are the best textbooks, best guides, and best weapons for the struggle between the two lines. Chairman Mao's latest instruction fully embodies Chairman Mao's consistent belief in and reliance on the masses. We must seriously study and deeply understand the history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party, and resolutely defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We will fight for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and die for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The revolutionary workers, soldiers, and poor peasants of the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an excitedly said, "Let the broad revolutionary masses directly participate in the struggle between the two lines within the Party. This is Chairman Mao's great innovation. When Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is grasped by the masses, it will become a spiritual atomic bomb against revisionism and prevent revisionism, ensuring that our Party and state will never change color for thousands of generations. The broad masses understand the history of the struggle between the two lines within the Party, their minds are clearer, and their eyes are brighter. Whoever tries to restore capitalism will not succeed." The members of the revolutionary committees in various places emphasized in their study that historical experience tells us that the closer the Cultural Revolution is to comprehensive victory, the more profound and complex the struggle between the two lines will be, and the more necessary it is to grasp the education of the struggle between the two lines and continuously raise the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines among the broad revolutionary people. The broad revolutionary masses said: "Our line is Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; the viewpoint we must adhere to is the Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought on class and class struggle, on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must talk about it every day, every month, every year, and every generation, so that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line can deeply take root among the hundreds of millions of revolutionary people, thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois reactionary line, and seize the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution, continuously consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat."

In studying Chairman Mao's teaching that "historical experience is worth noting," the masses in various places deeply felt that decades of revolutionary struggle have proven that Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the lifeline of our proletariat and a red line leading to communism. Historical facts have also fully proven that the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line is a black line that attempts to restore capitalism and a black line that attempts to push us back to the old semi-feudal, semi-colonial society. The workers of the Third Cotton Textile Mill in Tianjin (formerly Dongya Cotton and Hemp Textile Mill) said, "Soon after the Seventh Plenum of the Second Central Committee, Liu Shaoqi rushed to Tianjin and eagerly embraced the capitalists, vigorously advocating the reactionary fallacy of 'exploitation is meritorious,' fully exposing Liu Shaoqi's traitorous face. The workers said, "Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us to rely wholeheartedly on the working class, but Liu Shaoqi relies on capitalists everywhere, attempting to restore capitalism. Today, we re-study Chairman Mao's teachings and feel particularly close to our hearts." The comrades of the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters excitedly said, "All the victories achieved by the working class of Shanghai in the Cultural Revolution are great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line over Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois reactionary line." The poor and lower-middle peasants of Jiaxing County, Zhejiang Province, said, "After the land reform, we firmly responded to Chairman Mao's great call to 'organize,' quickly launched the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement. Just as the agricultural cooperation movement was flourishing, the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi issued a black directive to 'slash the cooperatives,' seriously disrupting our county's agricultural cooperation movement. However, we poor and lower-middle peasants remember Chairman Mao's teachings and insist on setting up cooperatives, and the collective economy has been continuously consolidated and developed. Facts have proven that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is extremely wise and correct." At a symposium held by the leadership of Taoyuan Brigade in Luwang Commune, Funing County, Hebei Province, the brigade leader Feng Aizhong excitedly said, "Chairman Mao's latest instruction hits the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants. Our Taoyuan Brigade has gone through a fierce struggle between the two classes and two lines. Every step of our struggle against Liu Shaoqi's bourgeois reactionary line shines with the brilliance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In the more than two years of the Cultural Revolution, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants have implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, carried out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, smashed the infamous Taoyuan black experience concocted by the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi, and re-seized the leadership power usurped by a small handful of class enemies led by Guan Jingdong, and seized their political power. The soldiers of the revolutionary model troupe in the capital, as well as the workers and soldiers of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams leading the struggle, criticism, and reform in these art units, reviewed the battle experience of creating and performing revolutionary model operas under the leadership of Comrade Jiang Qing, further exposed and criticized Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices' heinous crimes of vigorously promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line, madly carrying out counter-revolutionary dictatorship in the cultural field, and preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. Everyone deeply realized that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary literary line is a powerful weapon for cultural struggle against the class enemy. They said, "Every model opera created under the leadership of Comrade Jiang Qing is a brilliant fruit of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary literary line. For Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line, we must talk about it every day. For Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist literary line, we must criticize it every day, criticize it deeply and thoroughly." The officers and soldiers of the "Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road" reviewed the company's battle history of following Great Leader Chairman Mao and entering Shanghai's Nanjing Road, using Chairman Mao's report at the Seventh Plenum of the Second Central Committee as a weapon to fight against various class enemies, deeply feeling that the People's Liberation Army is a fighting force in the face of armed enemies and a fighting force in the face of unarmed enemies. They said, "For nineteen years, our Eighth Company has relied on the great Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to win great victories against armed enemies and also win great victories against unarmed enemies. The more they talked about Great Leader Chairman Mao, the more they felt close to him, and the more they felt the invincible power of Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Members of revolutionary committees at all levels and soldiers across the country, while enthusiastically acclaiming the publication of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, have reviewed Chairman Mao's great teachings: "Because of victory, the people thank us, and the bourgeoisie will also come to praise us. The enemy's military force cannot conquer us, this has been proven. The bourgeoisie's praise may conquer the weak-willed in our ranks... We must make our comrades continue to maintain a humble, prudent, modest, and unhurried style, and we must make our comrades continue to maintain a style of hard struggle." They have deeply realized that this is Great Leader Chairman Mao's greatest concern and greatest care for the broad revolutionary cadres.

At this time when the Cultural Revolution has achieved great and decisive victories, remembering Chairman Mao's great teachings is a major issue related to firmly standing on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in the struggle between the two lines, and a major issue related to forever maintaining the proletarian nature and properly exercising power. They unanimously expressed that they would definitely remember Chairman Mao's great teachings, be highly vigilant against the bourgeois sugar-coated bullets, and forever advance along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!

The military and civilians across the country have resolutely expressed that they will closely unite around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, deeply carry out the study of the history of the struggle between the two lines, further raise the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, fully implement the various combat tasks proposed by the Eighth Plenum of the Twelfth Central Committee, and in the great upsurge of struggle, criticism, and reform, take Chairman Mao's report at the Seventh Plenum of the Second Central Committee and Chairman Mao's other important works as the best textbooks, best guides, and best weapons, to seize the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution.

    全国军民决心更深入地开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动，学习两条路线斗争的历史经验，彻底批判和肃清刘少奇的反革命修正主义思想，完成斗、批、改的伟大历史任务
    新华社二十五日讯　在党的八届扩大的十二中全会伟大号召鼓舞下奋勇前进的我国亿万军民，怀着万分兴奋的心情，热烈欢呼伟大领袖毛主席“历史的经验值得注意。一个路线，一种观点，要经常讲，反复讲。只给少数人讲不行，要使广大革命群众都知道”的最新指示的发表，热烈欢呼毛主席的具有划时代意义的马克思列宁主义文献《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》的重新发表，热烈欢呼毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！
    亿万军民极其认真地学习了毛主席的最新指示，重温了毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告，热烈地讨论了《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志和《解放军报》的重要社论《认真学习两条路线斗争的历史》，受到了极大的鼓舞和教育。他们一致认为，毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告，是引导全国革命人民从胜利走向胜利的指路明灯，是建立和巩固无产阶级专政、建设社会主义的伟大纲领，是整个过渡时期反对修正主义、反对“左”右倾机会主义路线的锐利思想武器，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的时候重新学习这一光辉文献，具有十分重大的意义。他们一致表示，一定要遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，认真地学习党内两条路线斗争的历史经验，进一步用毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的学说武装起来，把两条路线斗争觉悟提到新的高度，彻底批判刘少奇的反革命修正主义思想，彻底清算叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇叛党叛国的滔天罪行，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实党的八届十二中全会提出的各项战斗任务，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    毛主席的最新指示和重新发表的毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告迅速传遍全国城乡，亿万军民一片欢腾。在首都北京，在大工业城市上海和天津，都有上百万军民涌向街头和广场，通宵达旦地敲锣打鼓，燃放鞭炮，举行各种庆祝活动。在各省、自治区革命委员会所在地的城市和其他大、中、小城市，成千上万的军民抬着毛主席巨幅画像，举着刚写好的毛主席最新指示语录牌，纷纷欢聚街头、广场，举行了盛大的集会和游行。喜讯传到祖国的广大农村、牧场、山寨和渔村，广大贫下中农围坐在收音机旁，聚集在广播喇叭下，一遍又一遍地收听毛主席的最新指示和光辉文献。韶山、井冈山、遵义、延安和安源等地的英雄儿女听了广播，载歌载舞，热情歌颂毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利。驻守在内蒙古草原、帕米尔高原的边防战士，连夜组成宣传队，跨上战马，顶风冒雪，把喜讯迅速传给兄弟民族。驻守在海防前哨的指战员听完广播，立即举行庆祝集会，热烈赞颂毛主席的英明领导，赞颂毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利。
    全国亿万军民在学习时一致认为，伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示和毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告这一划时代光辉文献的重新发表，是以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的又一个伟大战略部署。毛主席的最新指示和毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告，是深入开展两条路线斗争的伟大纲领，是大大提高亿万革命人民的两条路线斗争觉悟、彻底批判刘少奇反革命修正主义路线的强大的思想武器。党内两条路线斗争的历史，充分地证明了毛主席在七届二中全会的报告中就奠定了基础的、后来又不断丰富和发展的无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论、路线、方针、政策的无比正确。
    各地广大革命群众一致认为，毛主席在七届二中全会的报告和毛主席的其他光辉著作，是进行两条路线斗争的最好教材，最好指南，最好武器。毛主席的最新指示，最充分地体现了毛主席一贯相信群众、依靠群众的伟大思想。我们一定要认真学习、深刻理解党内两条路线斗争的历史，誓死捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，生为毛主席的无产阶级革命路线而战斗，死为毛主席的革命路线而献身。革命圣地延安的革命工人、驻军指战员和贫下中农激动地说，让广大革命人民群众直接参加党内两条路线的斗争，这是毛主席的伟大创举。毛主席的革命路线被广大群众掌握，就会变成反修、防修的精神原子弹，保证我们党和国家千秋万代永不变色。广大群众懂得了党内两条路线斗争的历史，心更明，眼更亮，谁要搞资本主义复辟都不能得逞。各地革委会成员在学习时着重指出，历史的经验告诉我们，无产阶级文化大革命越接近全面胜利，两条路线斗争就越深刻复杂，就越需要狠抓两条路线斗争的教育，不断提高广大革命人民群众阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟。广大革命群众说：我们的路线，就是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线；我们要坚持的观点，就是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想关于阶级和阶级斗争的观点，关于无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的观点。我们要天天讲，月月讲，年年讲，代代讲，让毛主席的无产阶级革命路线在亿万革命人民中深深扎根，把刘少奇的资产阶级反动路线批深批臭，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，不断地巩固无产阶级专政。
    各地广大军民在学习毛主席“历史的经验值得注意”这一教导时，深有体会地说，几十年革命斗争的历史证明，毛主席的革命路线是我们无产阶级的生命线，是一条通向共产主义的红线。历史事实也充分证明，叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的反革命修正主义路线，是一条妄图复辟资本主义的黑线，是一条妄图把我们推到半封建、半殖民地社会老路上去的黑线。天津第三毛纺织厂（原东亚毛麻纺织厂）的工人们说，党的七届二中全会开过不久，刘少奇就迫不及待地窜到天津，一头投进资本家的怀抱，大肆鼓吹“剥削有功”的反动谬论，充分暴露了刘少奇的工贼嘴脸。工人们说，伟大领袖毛主席教导要全心全意地依靠工人阶级，刘少奇却处处依靠资本家，妄想复辟资本主义。今天我们重新学习毛主席的教导，感到特别亲切。上海工人革命造反总司令部的同志们兴奋地说，上海工人阶级在无产阶级文化大革命中取得的一切胜利，都是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线战胜刘少奇的资产阶级反动路线的伟大胜利。浙江省嘉兴县的贫下中农说，土地改革后，我们坚决响应毛主席“组织起来”的伟大号召，迅速开展了农业互助合作运动。正当农业合作化运动蓬勃发展的时候，叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇下了个“大砍合作社”的黑指示，使我县农业合作化运动遭受了严重破坏。但是，我们贫下中农牢记毛主席的教导，坚持办起了合作社，集体经济不断得到了巩固和发展。事实雄辩地证明，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线无比英明，无比正确。在河北省抚宁县卢王庄公社桃园大队召开的座谈会上，大队领导班子负责人冯爱忠激动地说，毛主席的最新指示，句句说到我们贫下中农的心坎上。我们桃园大队就是在两个阶级、两条路线的激烈搏斗中走过来的。我们同刘少奇的资产阶级反动路线作斗争所走过的道路，步步都闪耀着毛主席革命路线的光辉。在两年多来的无产阶级文化大革命中，广大贫下中农条条落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，深入持久地开展革命大批判，把叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇炮制的、臭名昭著的桃园黑经验砸了个稀巴烂，把被以关景东为首的一小撮阶级敌人篡夺的领导权重新夺了回来，并专了他们的政。首都革命文艺样板团的战士，以及在这些文艺单位领导斗、批、改的工人、解放军毛泽东思想宣传队，回顾了在江青同志率领下创作和演出革命样板戏的战斗经历，进一步揭露和批判了刘少奇及其同伙大肆推行反革命修正主义文艺黑线，疯狂地在文化领域向无产阶级进行反革命的专政，为资本主义复辟作舆论准备的滔天罪行。大家深刻认识到，毛主席的无产阶级革命文艺路线是向阶级敌人作文化斗争的强大武器。他们说，在江青同志率领下创作的每个样板戏，都是毛主席无产阶级革命文艺路线的胜利硕果。对毛主席的革命文艺路线，我们就是要天天讲。对刘少奇的反革命修正主义文艺路线，我们就是要天天批，批深批臭。“南京路上好八连”的指战员们，回顾了连队紧跟伟大领袖毛主席、进驻上海南京路后，以毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告为武器，同形形色色的阶级敌人作斗争的战斗历程，深刻体会到，人民解放军在拿枪的敌人面前是战斗队，在不拿枪的敌人面前同样是战斗队。他们说，十九年来，我们八连就是靠伟大的毛泽东思想，靠毛主席的革命路线，在拿枪的敌人面前打了大胜仗，在不拿枪的敌人面前也打了大胜仗。指战员们越谈对伟大领袖毛主席越亲，越谈越感到毛泽东思想、毛主席的革命路线威力无比。
    全国各地各级革委会的成员和解放军指战员在热烈欢呼毛主席最新指示发表的时候，重温了毛主席“因为胜利，人民感谢我们，资产阶级也会出来捧场。敌人的武力是不能征服我们的，这点已经得到证明了。资产阶级的捧场则可能征服我们队伍中的意志薄弱者”“务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风”的伟大教导，更深刻地体会到，这是伟大领袖毛主席对广大革命干部的最大关怀，最大爱护。
    在无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大的、决定性胜利的时候，牢记毛主席的伟大教导，是关系到在两条路线的斗争中永远、坚定地站在毛主席革命路线一边的大问题，是关系到永远保持无产阶级的本色，掌好权、用好权的大问题。他们一致表示，一定要牢牢记住毛主席的伟大教导，高度警惕资产阶级糖衣炮弹的攻击，永远沿着毛主席的革命路线奋勇前进！
    全国各地军民坚决表示，一定要紧紧团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，深入地开展两条路线斗争史的学习运动，进一步提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，全面落实党的八届十二中全会的各项战斗任务，在伟大的斗、批、改高潮中，把毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告和毛主席其他重要著作，做为最好的教材，最好的指南，最好的武器，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
