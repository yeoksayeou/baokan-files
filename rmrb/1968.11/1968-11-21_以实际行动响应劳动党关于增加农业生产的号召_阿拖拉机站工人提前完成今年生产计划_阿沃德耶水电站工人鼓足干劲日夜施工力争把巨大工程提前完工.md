	BEIJING, Nov. 21 (Xinhua) -- According to a report by the Albanian News Agency, the tractor drivers and workers at the tractor stations in Albania have completed this year's production plan two months ahead of schedule.

	To develop agriculture and increase grain production, the Albanian government has continuously added tractors and other agricultural machinery to the tractor stations, strengthening them. Currently, Albania's tractor stations and state farms have 9,700 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower).

	Due to the continuous expansion of tractor stations, the area of mechanized plowing and harvesting by agricultural cooperatives has increased unprecedentedly this year. Now, with the help of tractor stations, they are timely carrying out autumn sowing.

	The tractor drivers and workers at the tractor stations actively responded to the Labor Party's call to increase agricultural production and launched a competition. The amount of work they completed in the first ten months of this year is 42 percent more than the total work done in 1965. Now, they are continuing their efforts to carry out autumn sowing while also paying attention to cultivating new land.

	BEIJING, Nov. 21 (Xinhua) -- According to a report by the Albanian News Agency, workers at the Avrodye Hydroelectric Station in Albania are working day and night to speed up construction and strive to complete this new giant project ahead of schedule.

	The Avrodye Hydroelectric Station is located on the Drin River in northern Albania and is one of the largest projects in Albania's Fourth Five-Year Plan. Its generating capacity is nine times larger than that of the Karl Marx Hydroelectric Station, one of Albania's largest hydroelectric stations.

	Inspired by the decision of the Albanian Labor Party to achieve full electrification of the countryside, the workers building the Avrodye Hydroelectric Station are determined to put this project into production ahead of schedule. Under the efforts of the workers and technical personnel, the important project of the 300-meter-long, 13-meter-wide, and 13-meter-high bypass tunnel has been completed, and concrete pouring is underway. Although the bypass tunnel is one of the most technically challenging projects in the entire hydroelectric station construction, Albanian workers and technical personnel have overcome many difficulties to ensure the project's acceleration.

	Another project of this engineering endeavor—the concrete wall to prevent water seepage at the Zadya clay and gravel dam—is also under construction.

	After the completion of the bypass tunnel project and the concrete wall, some cofferdams will be built next year to block the river flow, forming an artificial lake with a capacity of about 600 million cubic meters of water.

    以实际行动响应劳动党关于增加农业生产的号召
    阿拖拉机站工人提前完成今年生产计划
    阿沃德耶水电站工人鼓足干劲日夜施工力争把巨大工程提前完工
    新华社地拉那十八日电　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道，阿尔巴尼亚拖拉机站的拖拉机手和工人，已经提前两个月完成了一九六八年的生产计划。
    为了发展农业，增加粮食产量，阿尔巴尼亚政府不断给拖拉机站增添拖拉机和其他农业机器，使拖拉机站得到加强。现在，阿尔巴尼亚的拖拉机站和国营农场已经拥有九千七百台拖拉机（每台按十五马力计算）。
    由于拖拉机站的不断扩大，今年农业合作社机耕和机械收割面积空前增加了。现在它们正在拖拉机站的帮助下，适时地进行秋播。
    拖拉机站的拖拉机手和工人，积极响应劳动党增加农业生产的号召，开展了竞赛运动。他们在今年头十个月完成的工作量，比一九六五年全年的工作量还多百分之四十二。现在，他们正在继续努力，在进行秋播的同时，注意开垦新的土地。
    新华社地拉那二十日电　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道，阿尔巴尼亚沃德耶水电站的工人正日夜加紧施工，力争提前建立这个新的巨大的工程。
    沃德耶水电站位于阿尔巴尼亚北部德林河上，是阿尔巴尼亚第四个五年计划中最大的工程之一，它的发电容量比阿尔巴尼亚目前最大的水电站之一的卡尔·马克思水电站大九倍。
    在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党关于全部农村实现电气化决定的鼓舞下，建设沃德耶水电站的工人们，立志要使这个工程提前投入生产。在工人和技术人员的努力下，现在，这一工程的重要项目——长三百米、宽、高各十三米的旁通隧洞已经打通，正在进行浇灌混凝土。虽然旁通隧道是整个水电站建设中最困难的技术项目之一，但是阿尔巴尼亚的工人和技术人员克服了许多困难，保证了工程加速进行。
    这个工程的另一个项目——在扎德亚修建的粘土砾石坝的防止水渗的混凝土墙也正在修建。
    旁通隧洞工程和混凝土墙等工程建成后，明年将开始修建一些围堰，以截住河流，形成一个蓄水六亿立方米左右的人工湖。
