The Unity Newspaper Exposes the Soviet Revisionists' Intensified Collusion with the U.S. Imperialists After Nixon's Election as U.S. President

The Soviet Revisionists Are Enemies of the World's People

The Albanian Newspaper Points Out That Nixon, Like His Predecessors, Is a Faithful Dog of the U.S. Monopoly Capitalist Group

	New China News Agency, Tirana, November 17th - The Albanian newspaper "Unity" published a commentary on the 17th, exposing the Soviet revisionist clique's intensified collusion with U.S. imperialism after Nixon's election as U.S. President.

	The commentary said, the change of the White House watchdog does not change the U.S. foreign and domestic policies at all. Whether it is the former Democratic President Johnson or the new Republican President Nixon, they are all of a kind, representing the U.S. big bourgeoisie. Nixon has already publicly stated that he will continue Johnson's policies. The Soviet Khrushchev revisionist clique is speeding up measures to continue and further strengthen its alliance with U.S. imperialism. In fact, Nixon is an old friend of the Soviet Khrushchev revisionist clique. When the head of this clique, Khrushchev, was plotting the general line of the Soviet-U.S. alliance with Eisenhower at Camp David, Nixon was the U.S. Vice President.

	The commentary pointed out that the exchange of heart-to-heart telegrams between Podgorny and Nixon, the Soviet proposal for negotiations on the so-called prevention of nuclear proliferation, and the harmonious meetings between the Soviet Ambassador to the U.S., Dobrynin, and high-ranking officials in charge of foreign affairs in the U.S. Congress, clearly show the Soviet revisionists' stance of strengthening the U.S.-Soviet collusion.

	The commentary further pointed out that the actions of the Soviet Khrushchev revisionist leadership clique once again clearly show that they are traitors to Marxism-Leninism and enemies of the people of all countries, socialism, and communism.

	New China News Agency, Tirana - The Albanian newspapers "Unity" and "Warrior" published commentaries on the 10th, exposing the U.S. presidential "election" farce, and pointing out that the newly elected President Nixon, like his predecessors, is a faithful dog of the U.S. monopoly capitalist group in implementing policies of oppression and exploitation against the people of all countries.

	The commentary in "Unity" said, Nixon is no different from his predecessors. The U.S. imperialists' heinous crimes against the freedom and independence of the people of all countries, and their brutal oppression of American workers and blacks, are all inseparable from Nixon's name.

	The commentary said, Nixon's election made the reactionaries of all countries happy. The Soviet revisionist traitors could not help but feel satisfied. No matter who is in charge of the White House, the main target of the Soviet revisionist counter-revolutionary policy has been and will continue to be to strengthen comprehensive cooperation with U.S. imperialism. As a faithful representative of U.S. imperialism, Nixon has repeatedly expressed his willingness to further strengthen his collusion with the Kremlin traitors.

	The commentary in "Warrior" said, Nixon will continue to follow the old path of imperialist hegemony, aggression, oppression, and exploitation of the people of all countries, both domestically and internationally.

	The commentary said, the change of the White House watchdog reflects that U.S. imperialism is in deep crisis internationally and that class struggle and contradictions among monopoly capitalist groups are intensifying domestically. U.S. imperialism, in its desperate struggle to find a way out, is making its dying struggles. However, U.S. imperialism's dying struggles cannot save its crisis, and what awaits it are new failures.

　　阿《团结报》揭露苏修在尼克松当选美国总统后加紧同美帝勾搭
　　苏修是世界人民的敌人
　　阿尔巴尼亚报纸指出尼克松同他的前任一样是美国垄断资本集团的忠实走狗
    新华社地拉那十七日电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》十七日发表短评，揭露苏修叛徒集团在尼克松当选美国总统后正在加紧同美帝勾搭。
    短评说，白宫的看家狗的更换，丝毫也没有改变美国对外和对内的政策。无论是旧总统民主党的约翰逊，还是新总统共和党的尼克松，都是一丘之貉，都是美国大资产阶级的代表。尼克松已经公开声称今后将继续执行约翰逊的政策。苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团则加速采取措施，以继续保持和进一步加强同美帝的联盟。实际上，尼克松是苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团的老朋友。当这一集团的头子赫鲁晓夫在戴维营同艾森豪威尔策划苏美联盟总路线的时候，尼克松就是美国的副总统。
    评论指出，波德戈尔内和尼克松之间交换推心置腹的电报，苏联关于在所谓防止核扩散方面举行谈判的建议，苏联驻美国大使多勃雷宁同美国国会中负责外交事务的高级官员的心投意合的会晤，清楚地表明了苏修加强美苏勾结的立场。
    短评接着指出，苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义领导集团的行径，再一次清楚地表明，他们是马克思列宁主义的叛徒，是各国人民、社会主义和共产主义的敌人。
    新华社地拉那电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》、《战士报》十日分别发表评论，揭露美国总统“选举”丑剧，并且指出，新当选的总统尼克松同其前任一样，是美国垄断资本集团推行压迫和剥削各国人民的掠夺政策的忠实走狗。
    《团结报》的评论说，尼克松同其前任毫无差别。美帝国主义者反对各国人民的自由和独立的滔天罪行，以及它对美国工人和黑人进行残酷压迫，都是同尼克松的名字分不开的。
    评论说，尼克松当选，使各国反动派感到高兴。苏修叛徒们也不能不感到满意。不管白宫的主持人是谁，苏修反革命政策的主要目标过去是，现在仍然是同美帝国主义者加强全面合作。作为美帝忠实代表的尼克松，不止一次地表示准备进一步加强同克里姆林宫叛徒们的勾结。《战士报》的评论说，尼克松在国内外将进一步沿着侵略、压迫和剥削各国人民的帝国主义霸权政策的老路走下去。
    评论说，白宫“看家狗”的更换，反映了美帝在国际上正陷入深刻危机之中，反映了美国国内阶级斗争和各垄断资本集团之间的矛盾加剧。美帝为了寻找出路正在进行垂死的挣扎。但是，美帝的垂死挣扎挽救不了它的危机，等待着它的是新的失败。
