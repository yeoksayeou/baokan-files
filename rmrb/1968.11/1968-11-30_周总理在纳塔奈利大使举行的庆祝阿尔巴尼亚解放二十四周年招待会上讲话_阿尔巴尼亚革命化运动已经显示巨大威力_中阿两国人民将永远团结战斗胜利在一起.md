Xinhua News Agency, November 29th

Premier Zhou's speech at the reception celebrating the 24th anniversary of Albania's liberation, hosted by Albanian Ambassador to China Vasili Nataneli, is as follows:

Dear Comrade Vasili Nataneli, Comrades, Friends:

Today, we are very happy to celebrate the glorious 24th anniversary of Albania's liberation together with Albanian comrades. Please allow me, on behalf of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Cultural Revolution Group, the Chinese government, and the Central Military Commission, and on behalf of all the Chinese people, to extend our warmest congratulations and highest respects to the great leader of the Albanian people, our closest friend, Comrade Enver Hoxha, to the Albanian Party of Labor, the government of the People's Republic of Albania, the Albanian People's Army, and to the fraternal Albanian people.

The 24 years since Albania's liberation have been 24 years of continuous socialist revolution under the wise leadership of the Albanian Party of Labor, headed by the great Marxist-Leninist Comrade Enver Hoxha. It has been 24 years of vigorous socialist construction, 24 years of heroic struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, and 24 years of marching from victory to victory under the banner of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism.

In recent years, the glorious Albanian Party of Labor has launched a widespread and sustained revolutionary movement throughout the country. This movement has already demonstrated tremendous power in consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, promoting the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking, and advancing socialist construction. The recent Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labor further emphasized the need to carry out class struggle and implement the mass line, calling on intellectuals to unite with workers and peasants, and proposing tasks for deepening the socialist revolution. This will greatly promote the further development of the revolutionary movement. We believe that Albania's revolutionary movement will make increasingly greater contributions to enriching the historical experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat and to developing Marxism-Leninism.

The heroic Albanian people despise imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist clique, and resolutely fight against them. You have resolutely condemned the Soviet revisionist clique's armed occupation of Czechoslovakia, a heinous crime, and have withdrawn from the Warsaw Pact, which has become a tool for Soviet aggression. You have continuously denounced the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, exposing their conspiracy to collude and compete with each other in an attempt to redivide the world. The heroic Albanian people are a strong shock troop in the struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries.

The Chinese people heartily congratulate the Albanian people on the great achievements and glorious victories they have won over the past 24 years.

Comrades: The current world revolutionary situation is excellent. The national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America continue to develop. Revolutionary mass movements in Europe, North America, and Oceania are surging. These two revolutionary currents have merged into a mighty revolutionary torrent, fiercely assaulting the old world. In the struggle, the revolutionary consciousness of the people of all countries is constantly rising, and the true forces of Marxism-Leninism are constantly growing. As Chairman Mao has pointed out, the world revolution has entered a great new era. A new great upsurge in the struggle against U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism is on the horizon.

The Soviet revisionist clique, with the tacit support and backing of U.S. imperialism, has committed the heinous crime of armed occupation of Czechoslovakia, declaring the complete bankruptcy of modern revisionism. The imperialists led by the United States are in an extremely serious political and economic crisis. The U.S. monopoly capitalist clique has kicked out the Democratic Party and brought in the Republican Party, but this has done nothing to help them escape their dire internal and external predicaments. U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism will not voluntarily exit the historical stage. The more they are cornered, the more desperately they will struggle. But their struggles will only deepen their internal and external contradictions and provoke greater resistance from their own people and the people of other countries. U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism are rotting away day by day, and their days are numbered.

U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism are frantically shouting anti-China and anti-Albania slogans, trying to direct their aggression towards China and Albania, which uphold the banner of Marxism-Leninism revolution. This is nothing to be afraid of. The more they oppose us, the more it proves that we are right. In the future, our two countries will continue to do so. We will also do so together with the true Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people of the world. We will unite with all the people oppressed by U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism and their lackeys, forming a broad united front, to thoroughly smash the evil conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism to redivide the world, and to carry the struggle against imperialism and revisionism through to the end!

Comrades: Your revolutionary movement is in good shape. Our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is also in good shape. Our revolutionary friendship is developing and strengthening more and more. As Comrade Enver Hoxha has pointed out, our unity is strong and unbreakable, our friendship is eternal, because our unity and friendship are built on the solid foundation of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, because our two parties and two peoples, in their struggle on all fronts against imperialism and revisionism, are guided by the same goals and the same Marxist-Leninist ideology. In the common struggle, our two parties, two governments, and two peoples have always supported, encouraged, and learned from each other, fighting side by side. The Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people sincerely thank the Albanian Party of Labor, the Albanian government, and the Albanian people for their great support in all aspects. The Chinese people will forever follow the teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong, "No matter what happens in the world, our two parties and two peoples will definitely unite, fight, and win together."

Down with U.S. imperialism!

Down with Soviet revisionism!

Long live the great, unbreakable friendship between the peoples and parties of China and Albania!

Long live the heroic Albanian people!

Long live the glorious Albanian Party of Labor!

Long live the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha!

Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong!

    周总理在纳塔奈利大使举行的庆祝阿尔巴尼亚解放二十四周年招待会上讲话
    阿尔巴尼亚革命化运动已经显示巨大威力  中阿两国人民将永远团结战斗胜利在一起
    新华社二十九日讯　周恩来总理在阿尔巴尼亚驻华大使纳塔奈利举行的庆祝阿尔巴尼亚解放二十四周年招待会上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的瓦西里·纳塔奈利大使同志，同志们，朋友们：
    今天我们非常高兴，和阿尔巴尼亚同志一起，欢庆阿尔巴尼亚解放二十四周年的光辉节日。请允许我，代表中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席，代表中共中央、中央文革、中国政府和中央军委，代表全体中国人民，向阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖、中国人民最亲密的朋友恩维尔·霍查同志，向阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府、阿尔巴尼亚人民军，向兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民，表示最热烈的祝贺和最崇高的敬意。
    阿尔巴尼亚解放后的二十四年，是英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民在以伟大的马克思列宁主义者恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的英明领导下，不断推进社会主义革命的二十四年，是社会主义建设蓬勃发展的二十四年，是同帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派英勇斗争的二十四年，是高举马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的革命大旗从胜利走向胜利的二十四年。
    近几年来，光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党在全国深入持久地开展了一场广泛的革命化运动。这个运动，对于巩固无产阶级专政，促进人的思想革命化，推进社会主义建设，已经显示了巨大的威力。不久前召开的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第六次中央全会，进一步强调开展阶级斗争和贯彻群众路线，号召知识分子同工农相结合，提出深入进行社会主义革命的任务。这将大大推动革命化运动的进一步发展。我们相信，阿尔巴尼亚的革命化运动，必将对丰富无产阶级专政的历史经验，对发展马克思列宁主义，作出越来越大的贡献。
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，藐视以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义，坚决同他们进行针锋相对的斗争。你们坚决谴责苏修叛徒集团武装侵占捷克斯洛伐克的滔天罪行，毅然退出已经变成苏修侵略工具的华沙条约。你们不断痛斥美帝、苏修，揭露他们互相勾结，又互相争夺，妄图重新瓜分世界的罪恶阴谋。英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，是反对帝国主义、反对修正主义和反对各国反动派的一支坚强的突击队。
    中国人民对兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民二十四年来所取得的巨大成就和光辉胜利，表示最热烈的祝贺。
    同志们：目前世界革命形势很好。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族民主运动继续发展。欧洲、北美、大洋洲的革命群众运动此伏彼起。这两股革命运动汇合成一支革命洪流，猛烈地冲击着旧世界。在斗争中，世界各国人民的革命觉悟不断提高，真正的马克思列宁主义力量不断发展。这正如毛泽东主席所指出的，世界革命进入了一个伟大的新时代。一个反对美帝、苏修的新的伟大的斗争高潮，正在到来。
    苏修叛徒集团在美帝的默契和支持下武装侵占捷克斯洛伐克的滔天罪行，宣告了现代修正主义的总破产。以美国为首的帝国主义者，陷入了极其严重的政治经济危机。美国垄断资本集团踢开民主党，换上共和党，丝毫也不能帮助他们摆脱内外交困、走投无路的处境。美帝和苏修是不会自行退出历史舞台的。他们越是日暮途穷，就越要进行疯狂挣扎。但是他们的挣扎只能加深他们的内外矛盾，激起本国人民和各国人民的更大反抗。美帝、苏修正在一天一天烂下去，他们的寿命不长了。
    美帝和苏修疯狂地叫嚣反华反阿，力图把他们的侵略矛头指向坚持马克思列宁主义革命旗帜的中国和阿尔巴尼亚。这没有什么了不起。他们越是反对我们，就越证明我们做对了。今后，我们两国要继续这样做下去。我们还要同各国真正的马列主义者和世界革命人民一起这样做下去。我们要和一切被美帝国主义和苏联修正主义及他们的走狗所压迫的人民团结起来，结成一条广泛的统一战线，彻底粉碎美帝和苏修妄图重新瓜分世界的罪恶阴谋，把反帝反修斗争进行到底！
    同志们：你们的革命化运动的形势很好。我们的无产阶级文化大革命的形势也很好。我们之间的革命友谊越来越发展，越来越巩固。正如恩维尔·霍查同志指出：我们的团结是坚强的，牢不可破的，我们的友谊是永恒的，因为我们的团结和友谊是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的牢固基础上的，因为我们两党和两国人民在各条战线上进行的反对帝国主义和修正主义的共同斗争，都是以共同的目标和共同的马克思列宁主义思想为指导的。我们两党、两国政府和两国人民在共同的斗争中，一贯互相支持、互相鼓舞、互相学习，并肩战斗。中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民，衷心感谢阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、阿尔巴尼亚政府和阿尔巴尼亚人民在各方面给予我们的巨大支持。中国人民将永远遵循毛泽东同志的教导，“不管世界上发生什么事情，我们两党、两国人民，一定团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。”
    打倒美帝！
    打倒苏修！
    中阿两党、两国人民的伟大的、牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民万岁！
    光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党万岁！
    阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！
