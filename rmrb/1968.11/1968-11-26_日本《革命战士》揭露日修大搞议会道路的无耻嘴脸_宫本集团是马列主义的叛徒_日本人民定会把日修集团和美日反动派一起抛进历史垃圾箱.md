Japanese "Revolutionary Warrior" Exposes the Shameless Face of the Japanese Revisionists Pursuing the Parliamentary Road

The Miyamoto Group is a Traitor to Marxism-Leninism

The Japanese People Will Surely Throw the Japanese Revisionist Group and the U.S.-Japanese Reactionaries into the Dustbin of History

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 23rd, Tokyo: The 20th issue of the Japanese magazine "Revolutionary Warrior" published an article exposing the traitorous face of the Miyamoto revisionist group of the Japanese Communist Party, which insists on the parliamentary road.

The article states: The Miyamoto revisionist group is a group of traitors. They wave the banner of Marxism-Leninism but in reality oppose the most fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism. They talk about fighting against U.S. imperialism but in reality act as the running dogs of U.S. imperialism. They spread the fallacies of the Soviet revisionist leadership, the biggest accomplice of U.S. imperialism, and regard serving the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries as their sole mission.

The article condemns Miyamoto Kenji and others as the chief culprits who have betrayed Marxism-Leninism and turned the Japanese Communist Party into a "bourgeois labor party." They are demons and monsters disguised as "communists," the best assistants of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, and enemies of the Japanese people.

The article points out: The Miyamoto revisionist group has all the rotten "theories" of revisionism, and their central issue is to oppose Marxism-Leninism's universal truth under the pretext of opposing "dogmatism," that is, to oppose the principles of the dictatorship of the proletariat and violent revolution. They peddle the illusion of "revolution through the bourgeois parliament" to corrupt the revolutionary spirit of the people.

The article emphasizes: The proletarian revolution can only smash the bourgeois state machine with the revolutionary violence of the proletariat and seize state power with the armed proletariat as the ruling class. This is the theory of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." This is the Marxist-Leninist theory of the state and revolution.

The article points out: The "democratic united government" in Miyamoto Kenji's mind is a government dreamed up by parliamentary illusions that completely abandon the Marxist-Leninist theory of the state. He attempts to lead the "bourgeois labor party" under the banner of the "communist party" to establish a bourgeois government called the "democratic united government" together with other social democratic parties under the rule of the state power of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries.

The article exposes: On August 4th, Miyamoto Kenji openly took a stand of surrender to the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries on the Kanto Broadcasting Station, saying: "We stand on the position of obtaining a majority in the Diet and then forming a government. We have not considered changing the nature of the government by force." Miyamoto Kenji is a typical "parliamentary illusionist" who openly abandons the principles of the dictatorship of the proletariat and violent revolution, and a traitor to Marxism-Leninism.

The article further exposes: The Miyamoto revisionist group constantly spreads illusions, saying that a "democratic united government" can be established through bourgeois elections, and that this government can "cancel" the U.S.-Japan "security treaty" by issuing a "notice of invalidation."

The article points out: The Miyamoto group's "prescription" not only cannot "cancel" the U.S.-Japan "security treaty," but on the contrary, it is to "cancel" the revolutionary struggle of the Japanese people to abolish the U.S.-Japan "security treaty" in the activities of bourgeois elections, making a great contribution to the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. Now, the anti-U.S. and patriotic struggle of the Japanese people to abolish the U.S.-Japan "security treaty" and oppose the revival of militarism is developing rapidly. The Miyamoto revisionist group's theory of "democratic united government" and "notice of invalidation of the security treaty" is to "cancel" the surging revolutionary struggle of the Japanese people into the world of illusions.

The article emphasizes: The Japanese people will not allow U.S. imperialism and the traitorous monopoly capitalists to ride roughshod over them for long. No matter how much the Miyamoto revisionist group blows the traitor's whistle, the broad revolutionary masses will still take action and march forward bravely. The Japanese people will surely throw the traitorous Miyamoto revisionist group and the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries into the dustbin of history and achieve the victory of the people's liberation revolution through their own strength.

    日本《革命战士》揭露日修大搞议会道路的无耻嘴脸
    宫本集团是马列主义的叛徒
    日本人民定会把日修集团和美日反动派一起抛进历史垃圾箱
    据新华社二十三日讯　东京消息：日本《革命战士》杂志第二十期发表文章揭露日共宫本修正主义集团坚持议会道路的叛徒嘴脸。
    文章说：宫本修正主义集团是叛徒集团，他们打着马克思列宁主义的旗帜，实际上反对马克思列宁主义最根本的东西，口头上说要同美帝国主义斗争，实际上充当美帝国主义的走狗，散布美化美帝国主义的最大帮凶苏联修正主义领导集团的论调，把为美日反动派效劳当作自己唯一的工作。
    文章谴责宫本显治等是背叛马克思列宁主义，使日本共产党变为“资产阶级工党”的罪魁祸首。他们是披着“共产党”的外衣的牛鬼蛇神，美日反动派最好的助手，日本人民的敌人。
    文章指出：修正主义的破烂“理论”，宫本修正主义集团一应俱全，而他们的中心问题，则是以反对“教条主义”为名反对马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，即反对无产阶级专政和暴力革命的原则，兜售“通过资产阶级议会”进行“革命”的幻想，腐蚀人民群众的革命精神。
    文章强调说：无产阶级革命只能是用无产阶级的革命暴力砸烂资产阶级的国家机器，由武装的无产阶级作为统治阶级来掌握国家权力。这就是“枪杆子里面出政权”。这就是马克思列宁主义关于国家和革命的学说。
    文章指出：宫本显治心目中的“民主联合政府”，是完全抛弃马克思列宁主义国家学说的议会迷所空想的“政府”。他企图带领打着“共产党”招牌的“资产阶级工党”，同其他社会民主主义政党一道，在美日反动派的国家权力统治下建立名为“民主联合政府”的资产阶级政府。
    文章揭露：今年八月四日在关东电台表演的宫本显治，公然向美日反动派立下了投降誓言，他说：“我们是站在在国会取得多数而后建立政府的立场上。没有考虑用暴力的方法改变政府的性质。”宫本显治是公然抛弃了无产阶级专政和暴力革命的原则的典型“议会迷病”患者，是马克思列宁主义的叛徒。
    文章还揭露：宫本修正主义集团不断地散布幻想，说什么通过资产阶级选举的投票能够建立“民主联合政府”，而这个政府发出一纸“安全条约失效通知”，就能够“取消”日美“安全条约”。
    文章指出：宫本集团的这个“处方”非但不能“取消”日美“安全条约”，相反是要在资产阶级选举的投票活动中“取消”日本人民争取废除日美“安全条约”的革命斗争，为美日反动派作出巨大贡献。现在，反美爱国的日本人民争取废除日美“安全条约”、反对复活军国主义的斗争正在以迅猛之势向前发展。宫本修正主义集团的“民主联合政府”和“安全条约失效通知”论，是要把高涨起来的日本人民的革命斗争“取消”于幻想世界之中。
    文章强调说：日本人民决不允许美帝国主义和卖国垄断资本长期骑在自己的头上。不管宫本修正主义集团怎样再吹起叛徒的口哨，广大革命人民还是要行动起来，奋勇前进。日本人民一定会把叛徒宫本修正主义集团同美日反动派一道抛进历史的垃圾箱，靠人民自己的力量取得人民解放革命的胜利。
