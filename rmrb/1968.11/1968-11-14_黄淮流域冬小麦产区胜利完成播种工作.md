The main winter wheat-producing region of China—the Huang-Huai River Basin—has successfully completed its winter wheat sowing. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in various provinces of the region have resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production." With the revolutionary spirit of "moving mountains like Yu Gong," they have overcome drought and flood disasters, making this year's winter wheat sowing both swift and good. According to incomplete statistics, the sowing area has slightly increased compared to last year. At the same time, the areas of deep plowing, high-yielding varieties, dense planting, ridge cultivation, and high-yield fields have all increased compared to previous years. Now, the wheat has sprouted and is generally growing well, with full and robust seedlings. The poor and lower-middle peasants in Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Shanxi, Northern Anhui, and Northern Jiangsu have begun the initial field management of wheat, striving for a bumper harvest next summer.

This year's winter wheat sowing work was carried out during the great upsurge of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, entering the stage of struggle, criticism, and transformation. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have carried forward the spirit of thorough revolution, deeply and persistently conducting revolutionary criticism. At the most critical time for sowing, many communes held Mao Zedong Thought study classes and criticism meetings in the fields. The revolutionary criticism has greatly raised the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, powerfully promoting the progress of sowing work.

During the sowing period, the revolutionary committees at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels in the winter wheat-producing regions, following the great teachings of Chairman Mao on "streamlining administration" and "the reform of state organs, the most fundamental point is to link up with the masses," sent large numbers of cadres to the production teams. They ate, lived, worked, studied, and carried out revolutionary criticism together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, fighting side by side on the front line of autumn sowing. Members of the revolutionary committees at various levels also went deep into the grassroots, through grasping typical examples and setting models, greatly promoting the enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary masses for sowing, thus ensuring the timely completion of the autumn sowing task.

    黄淮流域冬小麦产区胜利完成播种工作
    我国冬小麦主要产区——黄淮流域各省广大贫下中农和革命干部，坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，以“愚公移山”的革命精神，战胜旱涝灾害，使今年的冬小麦播种得又快又好。据不完全统计，播种面积比去年略有增加。同时，深翻土地、良种密植、畦田化和丰产田的面积也都多于往年。现在，小麦已经出土，普遍生长良好，苗全苗壮。河南、山东、河北、山西、皖北、苏北等地的贫下中农已开始小麦初期田间管理，为争取明年夏季丰收而奋斗。
    今年的冬小麦播种工作，是在无产阶级文化大革命进入伟大的斗、批、改高潮中进行的。广大贫下中农和革命干部发扬彻底革命精神，深入持久地开展革命大批判。在种麦最紧张的时候，许多公社就在田间办起毛泽东思想学习班、开批判会。革命的大批判，大大提高了广大贫下中农和革命干部的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，有力地推动了播种工作的进行。
    在播种期间，冬小麦产区的省、专区、县各级革命委员会，遵循伟大领袖毛主席“精兵简政”、“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众”的伟大教导，派出大批干部深入生产队，和广大贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同开展革命大批判，并肩战斗在秋种第一线上。各级革命委员会成员还深入基层，通过抓典型，树样板，大大推动了广大革命群众的种麦积极性，从而保证了小麦秋种任务的适时完成。
