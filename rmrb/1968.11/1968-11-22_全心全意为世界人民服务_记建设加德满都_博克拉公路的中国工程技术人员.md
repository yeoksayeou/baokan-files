In November 1965, a group of Chinese road construction engineers and technicians arrived in Nepal in accordance with the agreement signed in August 1965 between China and Nepal to build the Kathmandu-Bhaktapur Road. They shouldered the heavy responsibility of the Chinese people and wholeheartedly served the Nepalese people, contributing to the friendship between the peoples of China and Nepal.

The road from Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, to the important city of Bhaktapur in the west is 176 kilometers long, with treacherous and complex terrain, passing through many overlapping mountain ranges and raging rivers. For a long time, due to the inconvenient transportation along the route, the agricultural products and necessities produced in this region had to be transported entirely by human labor. Therefore, the construction of this road has long been the common wish of the broad masses of the Nepalese people.

The Chinese engineering and technical personnel, remembering the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings of "serving the people of the whole of China and the whole world," traversed thousands of mountains and rivers, walked hundreds of kilometers, fearing neither hardship nor fatigue, and worked together with the Nepalese people to complete the entire route survey of the road at the fastest speed in April 1966. The construction of the road officially began at the end of May 1967. The Chinese engineering and technical personnel worked together with the Nepalese workers and technicians. Whether in the scorching summer or the rainy season with heavy rains, they worked from dawn to dusk with the Nepalese workers, clearing mountains, felling trees, and building bridges, fighting on the construction site. Whenever they encountered heavy work and dangerous engineering tasks, the Chinese engineering and technical personnel always stepped forward. During the construction process, they discussed with the Nepalese workers and technicians to solve the problems encountered in the project, humbly learning from the strengths of their Nepalese friends, and at the same time, teaching their own technology to them without reservation. The builders of the two countries thus learned from and helped each other, forging a deep friendship in their joint labor. Many Nepalese workers were deeply moved and said, "The people sent by Chairman Mao are really good!"

The Chinese engineering and technical personnel cared for the hardships of the Nepalese people everywhere. One night in April, a house near the construction site caught fire. The Chinese engineering and technical personnel living nearby heard the call for help and immediately rushed to the scene. They braved the thick smoke and flames, risking their lives, and fought intensely to extinguish the fire. They had only one common wish: to definitely save the lives and property of the Nepalese people. Some, although injured, still insisted on fighting the fire with everyone. After a tense battle, the fire was finally extinguished. Their spirit deeply moved the local residents. The residents expressed their gratitude to the Chinese engineering and technical personnel, saying: "If it were not for the Chinese friends helping to put out the fire, the entire village would have been burned down."

Another family living near the residence of the Chinese engineering and technical personnel had seven people. One day, their house caught fire. The Chinese engineering and technical personnel immediately rushed over, braved the danger, and rushed into the burning house to rescue over a hundred pounds of grain and clothes. However, the house had already burned down. The Chinese engineering and technical personnel then discussed with the Nepalese road builders and decided to build them a new house. The Chinese engineering and technical personnel used their holidays and spare time to pick stones, dig mud, and find wood, while the Nepalese workers went up the mountain to cut grass. Everyone worked together, and soon built a new house. The family was very excited to see the new house. The eldest of the family often said to others, "Chairman Mao is good, the people sent by Chairman Mao saved our family." To express their family's love for Chairman Mao, they hung a portrait of Chairman Mao in the new house.

The medical personnel working along the line enthusiastically treated the local residents, curing many patients, including some who were critically ill or had long-term untreated diseases.

A farmer named Bahadur had a severe abscess and had been bedridden for half a year, his life hanging by a thread. The local people carried him from more than twenty miles away to the residence of the Chinese engineering and technical personnel to seek treatment from the Chinese doctors. The Chinese doctors received the patient with great enthusiasm and immediately set up an operating table in the residence to drain the pus from the patient's body and perform surgery. After more than a month of treatment, the farmer recovered his health. He excitedly told others, "The Chinese doctors gave me a second life." After recovering from his illness, he often visited the residence of the Chinese engineering and technical personnel to see the Chinese doctors.

The spirit of the Chinese engineering and technical personnel, who wholeheartedly serve the Nepalese people, has been highly praised by the Nepalese people. Nepalese friends said with emotion: "Chinese friends help us build, only the people sent by Chairman Mao can do this." Not long ago, newspapers such as the *New Society* and the *Nepalese Language Newspaper* published editorials praising, "The Chinese engineering and technical personnel are truly here to help us build." "China is Nepal's true friend."

    全心全意为世界人民服务
    ——记建设加德满都—博克拉公路的中国工程技术人员
    一九六五年十一月，一批中国公路工程技术人员，根据一九六五年八月中国和尼泊尔两国签订的关于修建加德满都—博克拉公路议定书，肩负着祖国人民的重托来到了尼泊尔。他们全心全意为尼泊尔人民服务，为增进中国和尼泊尔两国人民之间的友谊作出了贡献。
    从尼泊尔首都加德满都通往西部重要城市博克拉的这条公路长一百七十六公里，沿线地势险要复杂，通过许多峰峦重叠的大山和急流滚滚的河川。长期以来，由于沿线的交通十分不便，这个地区出产的农产品和必需品的运输，不得不全靠人力背运。因此，修建这条公路早就是尼泊尔广大人民的共同心愿。
    中国工程技术人员牢记伟大领袖毛主席关于“为全中国人民和全世界人民服务”的教导，跋涉千山万水，步行几百公里，不怕苦，不怕累，和尼泊尔人民一起，以最快的速度在一九六六年四月间完成了公路全线的勘探工作。一九六七年五月底，公路的建设工程正式开始了。中国工程技术人员与尼泊尔工人、技术人员一起投入了辛勤的劳动。无论在骄日似火的盛夏，还是暴雨如注的雨季，他们从早到晚和尼泊尔工人一起开山劈岭，伐木架桥，奋战在工地上。每当遇到重活和危险工程时，中国工程技术人员总是挺身而出。他们在施工过程中，与尼泊尔工人和技术人员一起商量解决工程中碰到的问题，虚心学习尼泊尔朋友的长处，同时也把自己的技术毫无保留地教给他们，中尼两国建设者就这样互学互帮，在共同的劳动中结成了深厚的友谊。很多尼泊尔工人深受感动地说：“毛主席派来的人真好！”
    中国工程技术人员，处处关心尼泊尔人民的疾苦。今年四月的一个深夜，工地附近的一间民房起火，住在附近的中国工程技术人员听到救火的呼叫声，立即奔向现场。他们不顾浓烟和烈火，冒着生命危险，紧张地投入灭火战斗。他们只有一个共同的愿望：一定要保住尼泊尔人民的生命财产。有的人虽然受伤了，仍然坚持和大家一起救火。经过一场紧张的战斗，终于把大火扑灭了。他们的这种精神，深深感动了当地居民。居民们对中国工程技术人员表示感谢。他们说：如果没有中国朋友帮助救火，整个村子有被烧掉的危险。
    另有一户住在中国工程技术人员驻地附近的居民，全家七口人。一天，房子失火了，中国工程技术人员立即赶去，冒着危险，闯入大火燃烧的屋子里，把一百多斤粮食以及衣服等抢救了出来。但是房子已经烧掉了。中国工程技术人员就同尼泊尔筑路工人一起研究，决定给他们盖一间新房子。中国工程技术人员利用假日、工余时间拣石头，挖泥，找木料，尼泊尔工人也上山割草，大家一起动手，很快地盖起了新房。这一家人看到新房子，非常激动。这家的老大爷逢人就说：“毛主席好，毛主席派来的人救了我们一家”。为了表示他们一家对毛主席的热爱，他们在新屋里挂起了一张毛主席像。
    在沿线工作的中国医务人员热心地给当地居民治病，医好了很多病人，其中，有的是生命垂危的或长期治疗不愈的病人。
    一位叫巴哈杜尔的农民，患着严重脓肿，已经卧床半年，生命垂危。当地群众从二十多里远的地方把他抬到中国工程技术人员住地，找中国医生给治疗。中国医生满腔热情地接待了这位病人，并且立即在住地的屋子里搭起了手术台，从病人身上挤出了脓水，动了手术，经过一个多月的治疗，这位农民恢复了健康。他激动地对别人说：“是中国医生给了我第二次生命。”他病愈回家后，还经常到中国工程技术人员住的地方看望中国医生。
    中国工程技术人员这种全心全意为尼泊尔人民服务的精神深受尼泊尔人民的赞扬。尼泊尔朋友感动地说：中国朋友帮助我们建设，这只有毛主席派来的人才能做到。不久以前，《新社会报》和《尼泊尔语言报》等报刊都发表社论赞扬说：“中国工程技术人员是真正来帮助我们建设的。”“中国是尼泊尔的真正的朋友”。　　　　　　　新华社记者
