The great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin personally approved, and the Central Military Commission issued an order, conferring the title of "Model Company for Loving the People" upon the Fourth Company of a certain unit in the Guangzhou Military Region. This is a great encouragement and great concern for the revolutionary construction of our army!

The Fourth Company has been rated as a four-good company for five consecutive years. In a recent battle to extinguish a mountain fire this year, they used their blood and lives to protect state property and the safety of the people's lives, achieving new merits for the people and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Fourth Company, such a formidable heroic collective, is a model for company construction and a glorious achievement of the four-good company movement.

Their political and ideological standards are firm. They have only Chairman Mao in their hearts and are "completely" and "thoroughly" for the people. In the face of raging flames, they issued a steel-like vow: "As long as we are here, we will not let state property be damaged." Even after being burned, they continued to fight. Some comrades sacrificed their lives for the people, and before their martyrdom, they still held high the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" repeatedly.

Their style is firm. They act swiftly and bravely, charging into the fiercest fires and daring to face the greatest dangers. They resolutely defend their battle positions, even to the point of death.

As the great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "This army has an indomitable spirit. It will vanquish all enemies and never be subdued by them. No matter how difficult and dangerous the situation, as long as there is one person, that person will continue to fight."

The heroic deeds of the Fourth Company fully prove that our companies, as long as they seriously implement Chairman Mao's proletarian military line and build according to the four-good standards, will have the strongest combat effectiveness and be able to withstand any severe tests.

Vice Chairman Lin pointed out: "The Chinese People's Liberation Army is an army armed with Mao Zedong Thought, an army that serves the people wholeheartedly, and therefore an invincible army."

The reason why the Fourth Company is so firm is that they insist on using Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle and carry out the ideological revolutionization of the people. They "study and implement Chairman Mao's instructions without any deviation. They respond to Chairman Mao's battle orders with swift action and unyielding spirit." With such unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao and a revolutionary learning style of action matching words, Mao Zedong Thought deeply takes root in the company.

The reason why the Fourth Company is so firm is that they follow Chairman Mao's teachings, always love the people, and maintain close ties with the masses. In times of war, they fight bravely for the people's interests; in peacetime, they always care for the masses and help them solve difficulties; during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they firmly support and protect the broad revolutionary masses. The glorious tradition of loving the people makes the thought of serving the people wholeheartedly become the action of the broad cadre and soldiers.

All companies in our army should learn from the "Model Company for Loving the People" that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and the people, further carry out the four-good company movement, strive to create more heroic collectives like the Fourth Company, and make the brilliant flower of the four-good company movement bear even more abundant fruits.

　　四好连队运动的光辉成果
    伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席亲自批准，中央军委发布命令，授予广州部队某部四连“爱民模范连”光荣称号。这是对我军革命化建设的巨大鼓舞，巨大关怀！
    四连是连续五年被评为四好的连队。在今年一次扑灭山火的战斗中，他们用鲜血和生命保护了国家财产和人民生命安全，为人民、为无产阶级文化大革命立下了新功。四连这样一个过硬的英雄集体，是连队建设的好榜样，是四好连队运动的光辉成果。
    他们的政治思想过得硬。心中只有毛主席，“完全”“彻底”为人民。在熊熊烈火面前，他们发出“有我们在，就不能让国家财产受到损失”的钢铁誓言。烧伤了，还继续坚持战斗。有的同志为人民献出了自己的生命，在牺牲之前，还高举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，连连高呼“毛主席万岁！”
    他们的作风过得硬。动作迅速，勇敢顽强。哪里火猛就往哪里冲，哪里危险就往哪里闯。宁死坚守战斗岗位。
    正如伟大领袖毛主席教导的那样：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”
    四连的英雄事迹充分证明，我们的连队，只要认真贯彻毛主席的无产阶级建军路线，按照四好的要求去进行建设，就有最坚强的战斗力，就能够经得起任何严峻的考验。
    林副主席指出：“中国人民解放军是毛泽东思想武装起来的队伍，是全心全意为人民服务的队伍，因而是战无不胜的队伍。”
    四连之所以过得硬，就是因为他们坚持用毛泽东思想挂帅，搞好人的思想革命化。他们“对毛主席的指示，学到做到，决不两样。对毛主席的战斗号令，闻风而动，一往无前”。有了这种对毛主席的无限忠诚和言行一致的革命学风，毛泽东思想就在连队深深扎根。
    四连之所以过得硬，就是因为他们遵循毛主席的教导，一贯热爱人民，始终保持和人民群众的密切联系。在战时，他们为人民利益出生入死，英勇作战；在平时，他们时刻关心群众，帮助群众解决困难；在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们坚决支持和保护广大革命人民群众。光荣的爱民传统，使全心全意为人民服务的思想化为广大指战员的行动。
    我军所有连队都要向无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于人民的“爱民模范连”学习，进一步开展四好连队运动，为创造更多的象四连那样的英雄集体而奋斗，使灿烂的四好连队运动之花，结出更加丰硕的成果。
