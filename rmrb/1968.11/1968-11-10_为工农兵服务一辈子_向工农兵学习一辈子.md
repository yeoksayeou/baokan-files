For a long time, I have been torn between the ideas of "going" and "staying." In 1967, I graduated from the Military Medical University. I thought: my academic performance was not bad, and my other conditions were not bad either. At the very least, I should be assigned to a military hospital. To my surprise, when the list was announced, I was assigned to work in a certain regiment's medical team. This was a big disappointment. I found all sorts of excuses not to go to the medical team. However, as a soldier, I could not disobey orders. Reluctantly, I arrived at the medical team.

The comrades in the medical team were very enthusiastic in welcoming me. They all said: "Our team now has a female doctor, which makes it more convenient to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers." However, I was cold and distant, spending the whole day sulking in the room, waiting for night to fall and dreading the morning. I had no intention of interacting with the people around me. I kept thinking: "Sending a college graduate to work in a small medical team, cleaning toilets, and swatting flies, isn't this a waste of talent?" "Six years of hard work in college, all for nothing in the regiment." The more I thought about it, the more unhappy I felt.

The old comrades in the medical team were very concerned about me. Whenever they had free time, they would tell me stories about the war years and how they had saved brave soldiers. Listening to the heroic deeds of the predecessors and seeing my own actions, I felt a bit ashamed. Later, I studied the brilliant "Three Articles." Chairman Mao's great teachings greatly raised my consciousness. I came to the army to defend the motherland and support the world's revolutionary people. How could I be picky about my work? Chairman Mao taught us: "Intellectuals, if they do not combine with the workers and peasants, will accomplish nothing." I have already come to the grassroots level, to the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Why am I still unwilling to serve them, learn from them, and unite with them? I always say I listen to Chairman Mao's words and act according to his instructions, but looking at my performance, how much of it aligns with Chairman Mao's teachings? The more I thought about it, the more I felt I had no reason to leave. I decided to stay in the medical team, understand the workers, peasants, and soldiers, get to know them, and learn from them.

In the process of getting close to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, many touching stories deeply moved my soul. Once, a soldier from the Fifth Company, who came from a poor peasant family, was hospitalized for lymphadenitis. After a few days, he insisted on returning to work. I was a bit puzzled and asked him, "Why are you in such a hurry to go back?" The soldier was very excited and said, "I am carrying out the great task given to me by Chairman Mao. The whole company is working day and night to complete the task so that Chairman Mao can rest easy. How can I stay here?" This soldier's deep love for Chairman Mao and his noble character of selflessness educated me. Comparing myself to the soldier, I felt that my class consciousness was far inferior to the soldier's, and my class feelings for Chairman Mao were far less profound. Thinking about the daily situations I saw, every time there was a rest day, the most patients came to see the doctor. After inquiring, I found out that they were all afraid that seeing a doctor during work hours would affect the work. The soldiers endured the pain of the disease and did not want to delay the work for a single minute. This selfless spirit was what I lacked. To be able to serve such soldiers was a great happiness! At this moment, I began to realize that the gap between me and the soldiers was too big, and there were too many things I needed to learn from them. Working here, not only could I improve my skills in serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, but more importantly, I could often receive education from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, raise my ideological awareness, and establish the idea of wholeheartedly serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. These selfless soldiers were my best teachers.

With the desire to learn from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, there were learning opportunities everywhere. This year in January, during the task of receiving new recruits, I encountered another incident: New recruit Wang Zhilin's mother had just sent her elder son to support the construction of the border, and she brought her younger son to enlist. At that time, I thought: with her sons gone, how would she live? Curiously, I asked her, "Do you not miss your son?" The old lady cheerfully told me, "The people's mountains, if we poor and lower-middle peasants do not defend them, who will? For the sake of defending Chairman Mao, I am willing to give up everything! As long as the revolution needs it, I will even let my two daughters go." The old lady's deep proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao moved me greatly. Thinking about the situation I saw during this recruitment, where parents sent their children, wives sent their husbands, and brothers and sisters encouraged each other to enlist, I deeply felt that the poor and lower-middle peasants loved Chairman Mao the most and loved the cause of socialist construction in our motherland. They were also my good teachers. I could only honestly learn from the workers, peasants, and soldiers in the three great revolutionary practices to thoroughly transform my bourgeois worldview.

In the past, I envied the large hospitals. I always thought that the medical equipment there was complete, and there were many famous doctors and experts. Working in such a hospital, one's skills would improve quickly. After working in the medical team for a period, I had more contact with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and my thoughts and feelings gradually changed. I began to dislike the large hospitals.

Once, a worker comrade brought his child to the medical team for treatment. The child had septicemia, which we could not treat in the medical team, so I accompanied the worker to Beijing. We went to several large hospitals, but they all refused to admit the child. One hospital said, "We only accept patients with epidemic encephalitis B"; another said, "We only accept patients with dysentery." At that time, I was very puzzled. Why did these large hospitals have such detailed divisions? Later, I found out that their scientific research projects were what determined the types of patients they accepted. It turned out that they were not treating diseases to relieve patients' suffering, nor were they saving lives, but were treating diseases for research. They were not serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, but making the workers, peasants, and soldiers serve them. Seeing this situation, I felt very angry. This was the result of the revisionist medical line pushed by the traitor Liu Shaoqi. Under this revisionist line, who knows how many poor and lower-middle peasants and class brothers have lost their precious lives. Although these hospitals had good medical equipment, due to their lack of a red heart to serve the people wholeheartedly, even the best conditions could not be fully utilized. I have seen a university hospital with good conditions, but it often had medical accidents; our small medical team, with relatively poor conditions, had performed over four hundred surgeries in three years, but had not had a single accident.

Through these living facts, I deeply felt that technology is used by people. If technology is in the hands of the bourgeoisie, in the hands of those with bourgeois ideas, it will not be able to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Chairman Mao taught us: "The question of for whom is a fundamental question." If this fundamental question is not solved, the higher the technology, the worse it will be. The higher the technology, the easier it will be to go astray.

With the ideological problem solved, my actions changed. I no longer stayed in the room. I worked with the comrades in the team, climbing mountains and crossing rivers, doing everything possible to treat the workers, peasants, and soldiers, often not resting even on Sundays. No matter if it was internal medicine, surgery, gynecology, or obstetrics, as long as the workers, peasants, and soldiers needed it, I would do it. If I didn't know how, I would learn. I also actively participated in feeding pigs, raising chickens, and planting medicinal herbs during my free time, trying to increase my opportunities to learn from the soldiers.

In the process of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, I began to establish class feelings with them, began to see them as my class brothers, and began to see their pain as my own. Once, new recruit Wang Qingxin was injured, and I rushed to the scene with my comrades. Seeing my class brother injured while completing the task given by Chairman Mao, I felt very sad and decided to treat him well. Because blood and phlegm blocked his throat, Wang Qingxin had difficulty breathing, so I, without hesitation, gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to clear the blood and phlegm. Another time, new recruits were practicing grenade throwing, and I was on the scene doing first aid. Suddenly, an unexpected situation occurred: a soldier threw a grenade that was still armed in front of the shelter. In the moment before it exploded, I, without regard for my own safety, shouted for the soldiers to quickly lie down. The soldiers escaped safely, but my buttocks were injured. After the surgery to remove the shrapnel, the leadership told me to rest, but I thought: the soldiers do not leave the construction site even with minor injuries, what is this little injury of mine? So, I endured the pain and continued to work.

I have been in the medical team for just over a year. In this year, I learned more than I did in eighteen years of school. Looking back at the school life of more than ten years, under the poison of the revisionist educational line of the traitor Liu Shaoqi, I was long detached from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, detached from reality, and had many bourgeois ideas in my mind. In school, I participated in the Cultural Revolution for a year, basically rebelling against the capitalist roaders and class enemies; but I did not touch my own bourgeois ideas in my mind. Vice Chairman Lin said: "We must regard ourselves as a force of the revolution, and at the same time, we must constantly regard ourselves as the object of the revolution." In the medical team for a year, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's teachings, my bourgeois ideas have been initially transformed, and I have initially established the idea of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. However, I have not done enough and need to continue to work hard. I am determined to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers for life and learn from them for life in this great school of Mao Zedong Thought in the People's Liberation Army.

### 为工农兵服务一辈子　向工农兵学习一辈子

    为工农兵服务一辈子　向工农兵学习一辈子
    北京部队某团卫生队军医　朱泓
    “去”“留”之间的矛盾
    一九六七年，我从军医大学毕业了。我想：在学校里，我的学习成绩不差，其他方面的条件也不差，起码得分配到驻军医院。没想到一宣布名单，我被分配到某团卫生队工作。这下子凉了半截。我找了各种借口不想到卫生队。可是，一个军人又不能不服从命令。在不得已的情况下，我来到了卫生队。
    卫生队的同志们非常热情地接待我。他们都表示：我们队里有个女医生，为工农兵服务就更方便了。但是，我却冷冰冰的，整天闷在屋子里，天亮盼天黑，天黑怕天明，根本不想接触周围的同志。心里老嘀咕：让大学生到小卫生队工作，管厕所，打苍蝇，这不是“大材小用”吗？“六年大学苦用功，到了团里一场空。”越想越不是滋味。
    卫生队的老同志非常关心我，一有空就向我介绍战争年代，他们是怎样抢救英勇杀敌的战士的。听听先辈的英雄事迹，看看自己的行动，心里也有点惭愧。后来，我又学习了光辉的“老三篇”。毛主席的伟大教导，大大提高了我的觉悟。我是为了保卫祖国和支援世界人民革命来到部队的，怎么能对工作挑肥拣瘦呢？毛主席教导我们：“知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。”我已经来到基层，来到了工农兵中间，为什么还不愿意为他们服务，向他们学习，和他们相结合呢？口口声声说听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，再看看我的表现，那一点符合毛主席的教导呢？越想越觉得没有任何理由离开这里。我决心留在卫生队工作，了解工农兵，熟悉工农兵，学习工农兵。
    一心为公的人是我最好的老师
    在深入工农兵的实践中，许多生动感人的事迹，深深触及了我的灵魂。有一次，五连一个贫农出身的战士，因为患淋巴腺炎住队治疗，没住几天，他就坚决要求回去施工。我有点不理解，就问他：“为什么急着要回去？”这个战士很激动地说：“我执行的是伟大领袖毛主席交给的建设任务。全连同志为了早日完成任务，让毛主席他老人家早日放心，日夜奋战，我怎么能呆得下去呢？早回去一分钟，就是多向毛主席献一分忠心。”这位战士无限热爱毛主席，一心为公的高贵品质教育了我。想想战士，比比自己，我觉得自己的阶级觉悟远远没有战士高，热爱毛主席的阶级感情远远不如战士深厚。再联系到日常看到的情况，每逢公休日，来看病的战士最多，经过了解才知道：他们都是怕平时看病影响施工，才利用星期天来看病的。战士们宁愿忍受疾病的痛苦，也不愿耽误点工作时间，这种公而忘私的精神正是我所没有的。能为这样的战士服务是多么幸福啊！这时，我开始认识到：我和战士之间的差距太大了，需要向他们学习的东西太多了。在这里工作，不仅能提高为工农兵服务的本领，更重要的是能经常接受工农兵的教育，提高思想觉悟，树立全心全意为工农兵服务的思想。这些一心为公的战士就是我最好的老师。
    有了向工农兵学习的愿望，随时随地都有学习的机会。今年一月，在执行接新兵的任务时，我还遇到这样一件事：新兵王植林的母亲刚把大儿子送去支援边疆建设，她又领着小儿子来报名参军。我当时想：她把儿子都送走了，生活怎么办？我好奇地问她：“让儿子参军，舍得吗？”大娘爽朗地告诉我：“人民的江山，我们贫下中农不保，让谁保？为了保卫毛主席，我什么都舍得！只要革命需要，连我的两个姑娘也让她们去。”老大娘对毛主席深厚的无产阶级感情，使我非常感动，联想到这次接新兵中看到的父送子、妻送夫、兄妹互相鼓励报名参军的情况，使我深深感到：贫下中农最热爱毛主席，热爱祖国社会主义建设事业。他们同样是我的好老师。我只有在三大革命的实践中，老老实实地向工农兵学习，才能彻底改造自己的资产阶级世界观。
    为什么人的问题是个根本的问题
    过去，我对大医院那一套很羡慕。总觉得那里的医疗设备齐全，“名医”、“专家”多，在这样的医院工作，技术提高得快。在卫生队工作一段时间以后，接触工农兵多一些了，思想感情慢慢有了变化，对大医院那一套就有点看不惯了。
    有一次，一位工人同志带着小孩来卫生队看病。孩子得的是败血病，我们卫生队治不了，我就和这位工人一起把病儿送到北京。跑了几家大医院，他们都不收，这家说：“只收流行性乙型脑炎病人”；那家说：“只收痢疾病人”。当时我很纳闷，为什么这些大医院分工这样细呢？后来一打听才知道：他们的科学研究项目是什么，他们就只收这种病人。原来，他们不是为解除病人疾苦而治病，不是救死扶伤，而是为科研治病。他们根本不是为工农兵服务，而是要工农兵为他们服务。看到这种情况，我感到非常气愤。这就是大叛徒刘少奇推行的修正主义医疗路线的结果。在这条修正主义路线统治下，不知有多少贫下中农，有多少阶级兄弟丧失了宝贵的生命。尽管这些医院的医疗设备很好，由于他们缺乏全心全意为人民服务的红心，就是再好的条件，也发挥不了作用。我见过一个大学的医院，设备条件也很好，可就是经常发生医疗事故；我们这个小小的卫生队，设备条件比较差，三年来，大小手术做了四百多例，却没有出一个事故。
    通过这些活生生的事实，我深深体会到：技术是靠人掌握的，技术掌握在资产阶级手里，掌握在满脑袋资产阶级思想的人手里，就不可能为工农兵服务。毛主席教导我们：“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题”。这个根本问题不解决，技术越高越糟糕，技术越高，越容易走到邪路上去。
    工农兵需要的我就干
    思想问题解决了，行动上就变了。我再也不闷在屋子里了。我和队里的同志一起，跋山涉水，千方百计地为工农兵治病，常常星期天也不休息，再苦再累，心里也痛快。不管是内科、外科、妇科、产科，只要是工农兵需要的，我就干，不会就学。我还利用休息时间，积极参加喂猪、养鸡、种药材等劳动，尽量多和战士们接触，增加向他们学习的机会。
    在为工农兵服务的过程中，我和工农兵之间开始建立了阶级感情，开始把他们看作自己的阶级兄弟，把他们的痛苦看作自己的痛苦。有一次，新战士王清新被压伤，我和同志们一起赶到现场，看到阶级兄弟为完成毛主席交给的施工任务，不幸受伤，我心里很难过，决心要把他治好。由于血痰堵住喉咙，王清新呼吸很困难，我就不顾一切，嘴对嘴地给他吸血吸痰。还有一次，新战士进行手榴弹投掷，我到现场做救护工作。突然发生了意外情况：一个战士把拉着的手榴弹投在掩体跟前。在即将爆炸的一瞬间，我不顾个人的安危，呼喊战士快点卧倒，战士们安全脱了险，自己臀部却受了伤。经过手术，取出弹片，领导上让我休息，我想：战士们轻伤不下施工现场，我这点伤算什么，就忍着伤痛坚持工作。
    我来到卫生队刚刚一年。这一年里学到的东西，胜过学校十八年。回想十几年来的学校生活，在大叛徒刘少奇修正主义教育路线的毒害下，我长期脱离工农兵，脱离实际，脑子里有许多资产阶级思想。我在学校参加了一年文化大革命，基本上是造走资派的反，造阶级敌人的反；对自己头脑里的资产阶级思想，却没有怎么触动。林副主席说：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。”在卫生队的一年，在毛主席的教导指引下，我的资产阶级思想得到了初步改造，初步树立了为工农兵服务的思想。但是，我做得还很不够，还要继续努力。我决心在人民解放军这个毛泽东思想大学校里，为工农兵服务一辈子，向工农兵学习一辈子。
