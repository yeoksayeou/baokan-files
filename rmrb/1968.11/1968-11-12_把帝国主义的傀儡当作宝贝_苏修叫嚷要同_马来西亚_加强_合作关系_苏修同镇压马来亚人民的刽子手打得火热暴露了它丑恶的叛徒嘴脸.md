The Soviet Revisionists Treat the Puppets of Imperialism as Treasures
The Soviet Revisionists Shout to Strengthen "Cooperation" with "Malaysia"
The Soviet Revisionists' Close Ties with the Butchers Suppressing the Malaysian People Expose Their Ugly Traitor Faces

	NEW DELHI, Nov. 11 (Xinhua) -- The Soviet revisionist clique, in collusion with U.S. and British imperialism and the Malaysian reactionaries to suppress the national liberation movements in Malaysia and North Borneo and to oppose socialist China, is stepping up its collusion with the U.S. and British imperialists' tool and product of neo-colonialism, "Malaysia." This further exposes its ugly traitor face.

	According to reports, recently, the Soviet revisionist clique's "ambassador" to "Malaysia," Kuznetsov, shamelessly delivered a broadcast speech on the "Malaysian" radio, openly shouting that the Soviet revisionists attach great importance to the "good cooperative relations" with "Malaysia." He bluntly said that this is the stand of the Soviet revisionists.

	This "ambassador" also boasted that the Soviet revisionists and "Malaysia" have opened up new opportunities to promote mutual beneficial trade, economic, scientific, and cultural cooperation between the two sides.

	The Soviet revisionist clique as early as last year openly proposed to establish "diplomatic relations" with "Malaysia." In March this year, it dispatched its first "ambassador" to Kuala Lumpur, getting along very well with the Rahman puppet clique. Subsequently, the Soviet revisionists and this puppet clique sent various "delegations" to each other, frequently contacting each other. In May this year, the Soviet revisionist clique even "invited" an important figure of the Rahman puppet clique, Razak, to the Soviet Union for a "visit," and promised to provide "military aid" to "Malaysia" to suppress the national liberation struggles of the Malaysian and North Borneo peoples.

	The Soviet revisionist clique, together with the "Malaysia" Rahman puppet clique, which has long been spat upon by the Malaysian and North Borneo peoples and the revolutionary people of the world, is trying to develop "good cooperative relations." In the end, they will only lift a stone to drop it on their own feet.

　　把帝国主义的傀儡当作宝贝
　　苏修叫嚷要同“马来西亚”加强“合作关系”
　　苏修同镇压马来亚人民的刽子手打得火热暴露了它丑恶的叛徒嘴脸
    新华社十一日讯　吉隆坡消息：苏修叛徒集团出于伙同美、英帝国主义和马来亚反动派镇压马来亚与北加里曼丹的民族解放运动和反对社会主义中国的反革命目的，正在加紧同美、英帝国主义的工具、新殖民主义的产物“马来西亚”勾结，这进一步暴露了它的叛徒的丑恶嘴脸。
    据报道，最近，苏修叛徒集团驻“马来西亚”“大使”库兹涅佐夫，竟无耻地在“马来西亚”电台发表广播讲话，公开叫嚷苏修非常重视与“马来西亚”的“良好合作关系”。他露骨地说，这是苏修的立场。
    这位“大使”还扬言，苏修与“马来西亚”已经开辟了新的机会以促进双方“互惠的贸易、经济、科学与文化合作。”
    苏修叛徒集团早在去年就公开提出与“马来西亚”建立“外交关系”。今年三月，派遣了它的第一任“大使”到达吉隆坡，与拉赫曼傀儡集团搞得火热。随后，苏修与这个傀儡集团互派各种“代表团”，进行频繁接触。今年五月间，苏修叛徒集团甚至“邀请”了拉赫曼傀儡集团的重要头目拉扎克到苏联“访问”，并答应对“马来西亚”进行“军事援助”，以镇压马来亚和北加里曼丹人民的民族解放斗争。
    苏修叛徒集团与早已为马来亚和北加里曼丹人民以及世界革命人民所唾弃的“马来西亚”拉赫曼傀儡集团称兄道弟，竭力发展“良好合作关系”，到头来只能搬起石头打自己的脚。
