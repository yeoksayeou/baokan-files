	Promoting "intra-party peace" is essentially an attack on the Party.
	Red Guards  Zhong Yidong

	"Different ideologies and struggles within the Party are constantly occurring, reflecting the class struggles and contradictions between new and old things within the Party." Chairman Mao's great teachings are the most powerful criticism of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi's "intra-party peace theory."

	Liu Shaoqi verbally acknowledges but in reality denies that different ideologies and struggles within the Party reflect class struggles. He blathers on about how "intra-party struggles" are due to "different ways of looking at problems" and "different methods of handling problems." According to this logic, intra-party struggles are merely about resolving contradictions in "methods of looking at problems." He deliberately avoids mentioning that intra-party struggles are primarily struggles between two lines, which is a thoroughgoing counter-revolutionary fallacy.

	At every critical moment in the democratic revolution and socialist revolution, Liu Shaoqi and his agents have repeatedly emerged to oppose Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Isn't this a life-and-death struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines?

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Socialist society is a very long historical stage. In socialist society, classes and class struggles still exist, and there is a struggle between the paths of socialism and capitalism." The Party must lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses in their struggle against class enemies. Class enemies use every vile method to corrupt our Party, attempting to undermine it from within. Therefore, class struggles in society must be reflected within the Party.

	Our Party members do not live in a vacuum but in a society where classes and class struggles still exist. If proletarian ideology does not occupy their minds, bourgeois ideology will. In the struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines, you are either on the side of the proletariat or the bourgeoisie; you are either on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line or the bourgeois reactionary line. Intra-party struggles are always closely linked to class struggles in society.

	Our Party members come from all directions. Some, due to the influence of exploiting class ideology from their families, schools, and society, although they have joined the Party organizationally, have not joined ideologically. If these people do not strive to transform their bourgeois worldview, they will eventually take the path of anti-Party and anti-socialism. Moreover, class enemies use every means to infiltrate the Party, secretly causing trouble. When the opportunity arises, they jump out to struggle with us, even to seize power and usurp the Party. They never stop attacking the proletariat, and their struggle against us has never ceased. To defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, true Communists must engage in a head-on struggle with them until they are completely smashed.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Class struggle, once grasped, is effective." The class standpoint is the fundamental standpoint of Marxism, Leninism, and Mao Zedong Thought. Grasping class struggle is our Party's legacy and the fundamental principle of our Party's construction. Grasping class struggle and using the standpoint of class and class struggle to analyze everything can criticize revisionism, allowing Mao Zedong Thought to occupy all positions; grasping class and class struggle education can enhance Party members' class and class struggle awareness, keeping them alert and combative; grasping class struggle can expose the true colors of class enemies and expel them from the Party. Thus, the Party organization can become a vigorous vanguard organization leading the proletariat and revolutionary masses in their struggle against class enemies. Our grasp of class struggle is the biggest obstacle to Liu Shaoqi's usurpation of the Party and restoration of capitalism, so he is so afraid of talking about class struggle and tries to portray intra-party class struggle as "a struggle of methods" and "a struggle of understanding."

	Liu Shaoqi's promotion of the "intra-party peace theory" is an attempt to make the broad masses of Party members forget about class struggle and the struggle between two lines in a peaceful atmosphere, to coexist peacefully with the bourgeoisie, and to coexist peacefully with all opportunist lines, becoming numb and unable to distinguish right from wrong. In this way, a Party member completely loses the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat and becomes a "tame tool" for his restoration of capitalism; our vigorous and combative proletarian Party will turn into a revisionist Party serving the bourgeoisie. Liu Shaoqi's promotion of "intra-party peace" is essentially an attack on the Party!

	As long as class and class struggle have not been eliminated, intra-party struggles will never cease. We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching to "never forget class struggle," and continuously carry out intra-party struggles, so that our great Party will forever advance swiftly on the track of Mao Zedong Thought!

　　鼓吹“党内和平”的实质是向党进攻
　　红铁兵  钟以冬
    “党内不同思想的对立和斗争是经常发生的，这是社会的阶级矛盾和新旧事物的矛盾在党内的反映。”毛主席这一伟大教导，是对叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的“党内和平论”最有力的批判。
    刘少奇口头上承认实际上否认党内不同思想的对立和斗争是阶级斗争在党内的反映。他胡说什么“党内斗争”，是“因为各种党员看问题”和“处理问题的方法不同”。按照这种逻辑，党内斗争就是解决“看问题的方法”的矛盾了。他故意不提党内斗争首先是两条路线的斗争，这是彻头彻尾的反革命谬论。
    在民主革命和社会主义革命的每一个关键时刻，刘少奇及其代理人，一再跳出来反对毛主席的革命路线，这难道不是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的生死搏斗吗？
    毛主席教导我们说：“社会主义社会是一个很长的历史阶段。社会主义社会还存在着阶级和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义和资本主义这两条道路的斗争。”党要领导无产阶级和革命群众对阶级敌人进行斗争，阶级敌人则用尽一切卑劣的手法，腐蚀我们党，妄图从内部来搞垮我们党。所以社会上的阶级斗争，就一定要反映到党内来。
    我们的党员不是生活在真空里，而是生活在还有阶级和阶级斗争的社会里。在党员的头脑中，无产阶级思想不占领，资产阶级思想就要去占领。在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中，你不是站在无产阶级一边，就是站在资产阶级一边；你不站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上，就是站在资产阶级反动路线上。党内斗争，总是和社会上阶级斗争紧密地联系着的。
    我们的党员来自四面八方。有些人由于从家庭、学校以及社会上受到剥削阶级思想的影响，虽然组织上入了党，思想上并没有入党。这些人如果不努力改造资产阶级世界观，终究要走上反党反社会主义的道路。此外，阶级敌人千方百计混进党内，暗中捣鬼。一有时机，他们便跳出来，与我们展开斗争，以至夺权篡党。他们无时无刻不在向无产阶级进攻，他们对我们的斗争从未停止过。为了捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，真正的共产党员必须和他们进行针锋相对的斗争，直到把他们彻底粉碎。
    毛主席教导我们：“阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”阶级观点是马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想的基本观点。狠抓阶级斗争是我们党的传家宝，也是我党建设的根本。狠抓阶级斗争，用阶级和阶级斗争的观点分析一切，就能批判修正主义，让毛泽东思想占领一切阵地；狠抓阶级、阶级斗争教育，就能增强党员的阶级和阶级斗争观念，使党员保持清醒的头脑，保持高度的革命警惕性和战斗性；狠抓阶级斗争，就能使阶级敌人的原形毕露，把他们从党内清除出去。这样，党组织才能成为领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。我们狠抓阶级斗争，是刘少奇篡党、复辟资本主义的最大障碍，所以他才那样害怕讲阶级斗争，竭力把党内的阶级斗争说成“方法之争”、“认识之争”。
    刘少奇鼓吹“党内和平论”，就是妄图使广大党员在和平气氛中忘记阶级斗争，忘记两条路线斗争，同资产阶级和平共处，同一切机会主义路线和平共处，麻木不仁，是非不分。这样，一个党员就完全丧失了无产阶级的革命精神，成为他复辟资本主义的“驯服工具”；我们无产阶级朝气蓬勃的战斗的党，就会变成为资产阶级服务的修正主义党。刘少奇鼓吹“党内和平”的实质是向党进攻！
    在阶级和阶级斗争没有消灭之前，党内斗争永远不会停息。我们要牢牢记住毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，不断地开展党内斗争，才能使我们伟大的党，永远在毛泽东思想的轨道上迅猛前进！
