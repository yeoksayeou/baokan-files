According to a report by the Pakistan News Agency on November 6, the East Pakistan government protested against the Assam government of India for rebuilding trenches and bunkers along the Pakistani border in Behani Bazar, opposite the Sylhet district, with the intention of aggression.

The East Pakistan government stated in its protest note that these actions have brought danger to the border areas of East Pakistan.
