This article is a compilation of speeches by nine veteran workers from Wuhan: Wan Nengshan, Wu Dongshan, Zhong Chenghou, Liu Chuanfu, Huang Zhengxing, Chen Dengwen, Wu Guanghua, Yang Guangshuang, and Cheng Heqing. They are all veteran workers from the workers' self-defense corps and participated in the heroic struggle to reclaim the British concession in 1927.

As early as 1927, Liu Shaoqi was already a traitor to the working class, a criminal who collaborated with imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionary Kuomintang. We are witnesses to this history. We must expose and denounce Liu Shaoqi's collusion with imperialism, the reactionary Kuomintang, and the old right-opportunist Chen Duxiu in brutally suppressing the workers' revolutionary movement in Hankou.

During the First Great Revolution, we all toiled as laborers for the British and French imperialists and sold our lives to bureaucratic capitalists, enduring endless oppression and exploitation. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we workers decided to organize, unite, and overthrow the three great mountains weighing down on us.

In 1926, the revolutionary movements of workers and peasants across the country surged. Chairman Mao, in his brilliant work "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," pointed out: "The industrial proletariat is the leading force of our revolution." Later, Chairman Mao, while directing the Central Peasant Movement Training Institute in Wuchang, wrote another brilliant document, "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," which stated: "Revolution is an uprising, a violent act by one class overthrowing another." He called on the peasants to "overthrow the landlords' armed forces and establish peasant armed forces." Great Leader Chairman Mao supported our revolution and rebellion, greatly inspiring us. Chairman Mao's instructions spoke to our hearts and powerfully guided the surging workers' and peasants' revolutionary movements at that time.

Thus, the workers' revolutionary movement in the Wuhan region of Hubei province surged like a storm. We all joined the trade unions in the railway system and the workers' self-defense corps. The number of union members grew to 300,000, and even children formed labor youth leagues, launching a massive attack on imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. By the end of 1926, a nationwide general strike erupted. On January 3, 1927, British imperialist sailors brutally shot and killed our compatriots, creating the "January 3 Massacre." The workers of Wuhan were outraged, and we in the railway workers' self-defense corps were the first to take up sticks and stones, leading the revolutionary masses to shout slogans like "Down with British Imperialism!" and "Reclaim the British Concession!" We charged towards the British concession. At the time, British police tried every means to block us, and the gates of the concession were fortified with bunkers and machine guns aimed at the workers' self-defense corps. But we were fearless and charged in, eventually breaking into the British concession, driving out the police, and reclaiming the concession. We greatly humiliated imperialism and boosted the morale of the proletariat. The workers' self-defense corps became famous in Wuhan, and all revolutionary masses praised us, feeling proud and vindicated. British imperialism was terrified by the revolutionary actions of our workers' self-defense corps and was in a state of panic. The Kuomintang rightists, led by the tyrant Chiang Kai-shek, hated this revolutionary action and arrogantly claimed it would "lead to serious consequences" and that "violent actions must be absolutely avoided," attempting to strangle the burgeoning workers' movement. The old right-opportunist Chen Duxiu and Liu Shaoqi within the party parroted the imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek, acting as accomplices, and criticized the workers' movement in Hankou. The scoundrel Liu Shaoqi openly ordered the workers' self-defense corps to completely withdraw from the British concession. On January 7, 300 members of the workers' self-defense corps withdrew from the British concession with tears in their eyes. The hard-won victory we achieved with our blood and lives was thus handed over to the reactionary Kuomintang by the great traitor, spy, and labor tycoon Liu Shaoqi as a gift for his surrender to imperialism and the reactionary Kuomintang. This fully proves that Liu Shaoqi was already an old counter-revolutionary standing on the side of imperialism and the reactionary Kuomintang, and an early "Chiang Kai-shek" who had infiltrated our party.

Even more infuriating events followed.

Great Leader Chairman Mao taught us: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." From our long experience of oppression and exploitation, we deeply understood that we were oppressed and exploited by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism because the working class did not hold political power, and seizing power required guns. In the spring of 1927, Chairman Mao, while directing the Central Peasant Movement Training Institute in Wuchang, paid great attention to military training. We in the workers' self-defense corps, following Chairman Mao's instructions, also took up guns and conducted military training. At that time, out of over 5,000 members of the workers' self-defense corps, more than 3,000 had guns, and there were over 10,000 labor youth league members armed with sticks. However, after the revolutionary action to reclaim the Hankou British concession, imperialism and the reactionary Kuomintang hated and feared this workers' armed force, eager to destroy it. At this critical moment of the decisive battle between revolution and counter-revolution, on the fundamental issue of who controls the guns, Liu Shaoqi completely fell into the embrace of imperialism and the reactionary Kuomintang, fully exposing his traitorous face. At that time, Liu Shaoqi not only personally mobilized the workers' self-defense corps to surrender their guns but also, in the name of the "Hubei Provincial General Union," issued continuous telegrams such as "To the Workers" and "To the Soldiers" to disarm the self-defense corps. He even said that the workers' self-defense corps "affected the worker-soldier united front" and that disarming the workers' self-defense corps was "for the sake of revolutionary interests" and that there was "no need to be surprised." Even more shamelessly, he requested protection from the reactionary Kuomintang "government." On June 28, 1927, we heard Liu Shaoqi's order to completely disband the workers' self-defense corps and surrender all weapons and ammunition, and we were so angry that our lungs almost burst. We deeply understood the importance of guns and knew that once the workers' self-defense corps surrendered their guns, imperialism would once again run rampant, and the reactionary Kuomintang would again be arrogant, while we workers would once again suffer their trampling and slaughter. Sure enough, soon after the self-defense corps surrendered their guns, the reactionary Kuomintang began a bloody massacre in Wuhan. Under their counter-revolutionary policy of "rather kill a thousand innocents than let one guilty person escape," countless Communist Party members and members of the workers' self-defense corps were brutally murdered. We faced the danger of sacrifice at any time in the factories, and with a mere twist of the foreman's mouth, some of our comrades were dragged out and killed. The thriving workers' revolutionary movement was thus destroyed by the Chen Duxiu and Liu Shaoqi clique. The blood of the martyrs proves that Liu Shaoqi is the enemy of the working class, a loyal dog of imperialism and the reactionary Kuomintang, and a traitor to the workers' revolutionary movement.

Liu Shaoqi claimed that disarming the self-defense corps was to "protect revolutionary interests," which is complete nonsense. Guns are the lifeline of the laboring people. Once the lifeline is given up, what "revolutionary interests" are there to protect? The public enemies Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei, holding the guns surrendered by the self-defense corps, shot and killed members of the workers' self-defense corps, clearly showing that Liu Shaoqi was not "protecting revolutionary interests" but was instead protecting counter-revolutionary interests and currying favor with the reactionary Kuomintang. What he said about disarming the self-defense corps not being a "big deal" was clearly helping imperialism and the reactionary Kuomintang. When we surrendered our guns, we were so angry that our eyes sparked with fire, but the labor traitor Liu Shaoqi slandered us as "making a big deal out of nothing" and wanted us to be as submissive to the reactionary Kuomintang as he was. Bah! The working class has always been tough in the face of the enemy. We will still rule the world and trample on imperialism, the reactionary Kuomintang, and the dog Liu Shaoqi. What he said about requesting protection from the Kuomintang "government to show our sincerity in support" is the confession of Liu Shaoqi and his clique betraying revolutionary interests and surrendering to the public enemies Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei, a confession of this traitor. These facts are like a sharp sword, ruthlessly stripping off Liu Shaoqi's long-disguised cloak of "old revolutionary," "Marxist-Leninist," and "leader of the workers' movement," revealing the counter-revolutionary face of an old counter-revolutionary, old right-opportunist, traitor, spy, and labor tycoon who betrayed the workers' movement.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has exposed this thoroughly reactionary, counter-revolutionary revisionist Liu Shaoqi to the world, which makes us old workers both satisfied and vengeful. Our long-awaited wish has finally been realized. This is a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! It is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought! It is a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!

    我们是历史的见证人
    ——九位老工人愤怒控诉叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇一九二七年在武汉叛变革命，出卖工人运动，投降敌人的滔天罪行
    这篇文章是武汉市老工人万能山、吴东山、钟成厚、刘传福、黄正兴、陈登文、吴光华、杨光双、程和清等九位同志，在一次座谈会上的综合发言。他们都是老工人纠察队员，曾参加过一九二七年收回英租界的英勇斗争。
    早在一九二七年，刘少奇就是一个背叛工人阶级、罪恶累累的帝国主义、修正主义和国民党反动派的忠实走狗。我们是这段历史的见证人。我们要揭发控诉刘少奇伙同帝国主义、国民党反动派和老右倾机会主义分子陈独秀，血腥镇压汉口工人革命运动的滔天罪行。
    在第一次大革命的年代里，我们都给英、法帝国主义做过苦工，给官僚资本家卖过命，受尽了压迫和剥削。在毛主席革命路线的指引下，我们工人阶级决心组织起来，团结一致，推翻压在我们头上的三座大山。
    一九二六年，全国工农群众革命运动蓬勃兴起。毛主席在《中国社会各阶级的分析》这一光辉著作中指出：“工业无产阶级是我们革命的领导力量。”后来，毛主席在武昌主办中央农民运动讲习所时写的另一篇光辉文献《湖南农民运动考察报告》中又指出：“革命是暴动，是一个阶级推翻一个阶级的暴烈的行动。”并号召农民起来“推翻地主武装，建立农民武装”。伟大领袖毛主席支持我们起来革命，起来造反，极大地鼓舞了我们。毛主席的指示，说出了我们的心里话，有力地指导了当时高涨着的工农革命运动。
    于是，湖北武汉地区工人革命运动风起云涌，我们都参加了铁路系统的工会组织，参加了工人纠察队，工会会员一下发展到三十万人，儿童也成立了劳动童子军，向帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义发动了声势浩大的进攻，并于一九二六年年底，爆发了震动全国的大罢工。一九二七年一月三日，英帝国主义的水兵蛮横枪杀我国同胞，制造了“一·三惨案”。武汉工人阶级无不义愤填膺，我们铁路工人纠察队首先拿起木棒、石头，带领革命群众，高呼“打倒英帝国主义！”“收回英租界！”等革命口号，冲向英租界。当时，英国巡捕百般阻拦，租界门口碉堡林立，黑洞洞的机关枪口对准工人纠察队。但是，我们不怕死，一个劲地往里面冲，终于冲进了英租界，驱逐了租界的巡捕，夺回了租界，大灭了帝国主义的威风，大长了无产阶级志气，工人纠察队威震武汉，广大革命群众见了无不拍手赞扬，扬眉吐气。英帝国主义被我们工人纠察队的革命行动吓破了狗胆，慌作一团。以独夫民贼蒋介石为代表的国民党右派，对这一革命行动也恨之入骨，狂妄地叫嚣这“将引起严重后果”，“暴力行为则绝对回避”，妄图扼杀蓬勃兴起的工人运动。党内的老右倾机会主义分子陈独秀和刘少奇，也跟在帝国主义和蒋介石后面鹦鹉学舌，为虎作伥，责骂汉口的工人运动。刘少奇这个大坏蛋公然下令工人纠察队从英租界完全撤退。一月七日，三百名工人纠察队员含着眼泪，从英租界撤出来，我们用鲜血和生命奋斗得来的胜利果实，就这样被大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇拱手送给了国民党反动派，作为他投降帝国主义和国民党反动派的见面礼。这就充分地证明了刘少奇早就是一个站在帝国主义和国民党反动派立场上的老反革命，早就是一个钻进我们党内的“蒋介石”。
    更气愤的事还在后面。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“枪杆子里面出政权”。我们从长期受压迫、受剥削的痛苦经历中深深体会到，我们之所以受帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的压迫和剥削，是因为工人阶级没有掌握政权，而夺取政权只有靠枪杆子。毛主席一九二七年春在武昌主办中央农民运动讲习所时，就很重视军事训练。我们工人纠察队按照毛主席的指示，也拿起了枪杆子，进行军事训练。当时五千多人的工人纠察队，就有三千多支枪，还有一万多手执木棒的劳动童子军。可是，在夺回汉口英租界的革命行动发生以后，帝国主义和国民党反动派对这支工人武装恨得要死，怕得要命，巴不得马上把它消灭掉。就在这革命与反革命决战的关键时刻，在这枪杆子归谁掌握的大是大非的原则问题上，刘少奇完全倒在帝国主义和国民党反动派的怀抱里，充分地暴露出他的一副叛徒嘴脸。当时，刘少奇不仅亲自出马动员工人纠察队缴枪，并且以“湖北全省总工会通电”的名义，为纠察队解除武装连续发表了“告工人”、“告军士同志”等通电，还胡说什么工人纠察队“影响工兵联合战线”，解除工人纠察队武装是“为了顾全革命利益”，用不着“大惊小怪”。更无耻的是，他还请反动的国民党“政府保护”。一九二七年六月二十八日，我们听到刘少奇关于工人纠察队全部解散，枪支弹药全部上缴的勒令后，一个个肺都要气炸。我们深深懂得枪杆子的重要作用，知道工人纠察队把枪一缴，帝国主义就会又横行霸道，国民党反动派就会又气焰嚣张，而我们工人就会又横遭他们的摧残和蹂躏。果然，在纠察队缴枪不久，国民党反动派就在武汉开始了血腥的大屠杀。在他们“宁可错杀一千，不可漏掉一人”的反革命政策下，无数共产党员和工人纠察队队员惨遭杀害，我们在工厂里做工随时有牺牲的危险，工头嘴巴一歪，我们的一些同志就被拉出去杀害了。轰轰烈烈的工人革命运动，就这样被陈独秀、刘少奇一伙葬送了。烈士的鲜血足以证明，刘少奇是我们工人阶级的死敌，是帝国主义和国民党反动派的忠实走狗，是工人革命运动的叛徒。
    刘少奇胡说什么解除纠察队武装，是为了“顾全革命利益”，这完全是骗人的鬼话。枪杆子是劳动人民的命根子，把命根子都交出去了，还有什么“革命利益”可顾？人民公敌蒋介石、汪精卫拿着纠察队交出的枪杆子，枪杀工人纠察队员，最有力地说明了刘少奇不是“顾全革命利益”，恰恰是顾全了反革命利益，是拿劳动人民的命根子向国民党反动派献媚。什么解除纠察队武装用不着“大惊小怪”，这分明是在给帝国主义和国民党反动派帮腔。我们在缴枪时，气愤得眼睛直冒火星，工贼刘少奇却诬蔑我们是“大惊小怪”，也要我们象他这条走狗那样俯首贴耳地依从国民党反动派。呸！我们工人阶级在敌人面前从来是硬骨头，我们还要主宰世界，把帝国主义和国民党反动派连同刘少奇这条走狗统统踩在脚下，什么请国民党“政府保护，以示拥戴之诚意”，这是刘少奇一伙叛卖革命利益，投降人民公敌蒋介石、汪精卫的供词，是这个叛徒的自白书。这些事实象一把利剑，无情地剥去了刘少奇长期伪装“老革命”、“马列主义者”、“工人运动领袖”的外衣，露出了一副老反革命、老右倾机会主义分子、出卖工人运动的大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼的反革命嘴脸。
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，把这个恶贯满盈、一贯反动透顶的反革命修正主义分子刘少奇揪出来示众了，这使我们老工人解气又解恨，我们盼望好久的心愿终于实现了。这是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利！是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利！
