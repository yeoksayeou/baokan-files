		BEIJING, Nov. 11 (Xinhua) -- A Pakistani military friendship delegation led by General Yahya Khan, Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistani Army, held a farewell banquet here on the evening of the 10th.

		General Huang Yongsheng, Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and responsible officials from the Ministry of National Defense, the General Staff Department, the General Logistics Department, various military branches, and relevant departments, including Xiao Jingguang, Li Tianyou, Zhang Xianyao, Wu Ruilin, Tan Jiashu, Han Nianlong, Xiang Qian, and Ding Xilin, as well as representatives of the Five Good Soldiers of the PLA garrison in Beijing, were invited to attend the banquet.

		General Yahya Khan and General Huang Yongsheng both spoke at the banquet.

		In his speech, General Yahya Khan said, "Your great leader, Chairman Mao Zedong, and other leaders received us this evening. We feel greatly honored and grateful, and we deeply understand the great significance of this reception for Sino-Pakistani friendship. In our conversation with Chairman Mao, we gained tremendous benefits, and this reception will forever be in our memory. He said, "We have eagerly hoped to see some of the great achievements of the Chinese people in various fields, and what we have seen that impressed us the most is that these achievements are all the result of a policy of self-reliance. Your experience in this regard is a great inspiration to us."

		He said, "Under the leadership of President Muhammad Ayub Khan, the Pakistani people are making great efforts to rapidly develop the national economy."

		General Yahya Khan said, "Our two countries and peoples have forged a deep friendship. This friendship is based on sincerity and mutual respect for territorial integrity and mutual benefit. This friendship and cooperation between us are beneficial and positive developments and are important for the peace and prosperity of our region. He said, "We gratefully recall that when India invaded Pakistan in 1965, we received assistance from your great country."

		General Yahya Khan said, "The main purpose of the delegation I lead is to promote friendship and understanding between our two countries' armed forces. We bring greetings and good wishes from the Pakistani armed forces to the Chinese People's Liberation Army."

		General Huang Yongsheng then spoke. He said, "The visit of the Pakistani Military Friendship Delegation to our country has strengthened the friendly relations between our two peoples and armies and has increased our mutual understanding. During the visit, you were received by our great leader, Chairman Mao, and had a cordial conversation with him."

		Huang Yongsheng pointed out that the Chinese people and the Pakistani people are victims of the Indian reactionaries, who, under the protection of U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism, are recklessly expanding their military forces and strengthening their war machine, threatening the security of our two countries. Our great leader, Chairman Mao, pointed out: "Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor. The decisive factor is people, not things. The balance of power is not only a comparison of military and economic strength but also a comparison of manpower and popular support. The military and economic strength must be wielded by people." The Indian reactionaries' policy of military expansion and war preparations has deepened India's economic and political crisis. Under the pressure of neo-colonialism, India's economy is on the brink of bankruptcy, and public resentment is boiling over. The Indian reactionaries are so unpopular and isolated that they foolishly rely on a few weapons to stir up trouble, which can only lead to self-destruction like a moth flying into a flame.

		He said, "You have seen with your own eyes that our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved great and decisive victories. This is a great victory won by the hundreds of millions of Chinese people and the PLA under the wise leadership of our great leader, Chairman Mao; it is a great victory of invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The seven hundred million Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will certainly follow the teachings of our great leader, Chairman Mao, to better fulfill our internationalist duties, resolutely support the just struggle of all oppressed nations and peoples for national independence and liberation, resolutely support the heroic struggle of the Albanian people against imperialism and revisionism, resolutely support the heroic Vietnamese people in carrying out the anti-American, national salvation war to the end, resolutely support the just struggle of the Pakistani people to maintain national independence and oppose foreign aggression, and resolutely support the just struggle of the Kashmiri people for the right to national self-determination."

		Pakistan's Ambassador to China, Sultan M. Khan, and other diplomatic officials from the embassy, including Colonel Haidar and Colonel Kayum, attended the banquet. Invited to the banquet were also military attachés from various countries' embassies in China.

		BEIJING, Nov. 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Ambassador to China, Sultan M. Khan, hosted a reception here today for the Pakistani Military Friendship Delegation's visit to China.

		General Huang Yongsheng, Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and responsible officials from the Ministry of National Defense, the General Staff Department, the General Logistics Department, various military branches, and relevant departments, including Xiao Jingguang, Li Tianyou, Zhang Xianyao, Wu Ruilin, Tan Jiashu, Han Nianlong, Xiang Qian, and Ding Xilin, were invited to attend the reception. General Yahya Khan and the entire delegation he led attended the reception.

		Military attachés from some countries' embassies in China were also invited to the reception.

　　巴武装部队友好代表团举行告别宴会
　　叶海亚·汗团长说：毛泽东主席接见我们对中巴友谊有重大意义黄永胜总参谋长说：访问加强了两国人民和军队之间的友好关系
　　巴驻中国大使为代表团访问中国举行酒会
    新华社十一日讯　由巴基斯坦陆军总司令叶海亚·汗上将率领的巴基斯坦武装部队友好代表团，十日晚在这里举行告别宴会。
    中国人民解放军总参谋长黄永胜，国防部、总参谋部、总后勤部、各军种、兵种和有关方面负责人萧劲光、李天佑、张贤约、吴瑞林、谭家述、韩念龙、向前、丁西林等，以及人民解放军驻京部队五好战士代表应邀出席了宴会。
    叶海亚·汗团长和黄永胜总参谋长先后在宴会上讲了话。
    叶海亚·汗团长在讲话中说，你们的伟大领袖毛泽东主席和其他领导人，今天晚上接见了我们。这使我们感到非常荣幸和感激，并深深体会到这次接见对中巴友谊的重大意义。在与毛主席的交谈中，我们得到了巨大的益处，这次接见将永远留在我们记忆里。他说，我们曾经迫切期望看到中国人民在各方面所取得的一些巨大成就，而我们所见到的给我们印象最深的是，这些成果都是通过自力更生政策取得的。你们这一方面的经验是对我们的巨大鼓舞。
    他说，在穆罕默德·阿尤布·汗总统的领导下，巴基斯坦人民正以极大的努力来迅速发展国家经济。
    叶海亚·汗团长说，我们两个国家和两国人民结成了深厚的友谊，这种友谊是基于真诚和两国互相尊重领土完整和互相受益的根本利益之上的。这种友谊和我们之间的合作是一种有益和积极的发展，并且对我们这一地区的和平和繁荣是重要的。他说，我们感激地回忆我们在一九六五年印度侵略巴基斯坦的时候得到了你们伟大国家的援助。
    叶海亚·汗团长说，我所率领的代表团访问的主要目的是促进我们两国武装部队的友好和了解。我们带来了巴基斯坦武装部队对中国人民解放军的问候和良好的祝愿。
    黄永胜总参谋长接着讲话。他说，巴基斯坦武装部队友好代表团这次对我国的访问，加强了我们两国人民和两国军队之间的友好关系，增进了我们之间的相互了解。访问期间，你们受到了我国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的接见并进行了亲切的会谈。
    黄永胜指出，中国人民和巴基斯坦人民的手下败将印度反动派，在美帝国主义和现代修正主义的卵翼下，不顾本国人民的死活，仍在疯狂地扩充军备，加强它的战争机器，威胁我们两国的安全。我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。力量对比不但是军力和经济力的对比，而且是人力和人心的对比。军力和经济力是要人去掌握的。”印度反动派的扩军备战政策，加深了印度的经济和政治危机。在新殖民主义的压榨下，印度的经济濒于破产，民怨沸腾。印度反动派如此不得人心，众叛亲离，妄想依靠几件武器，就蠢蠢欲动，只能是飞蛾扑火，自取灭亡。
    他说，你们已经亲眼看见我国无产阶级文化大革命取得了伟大的、决定性的胜利。这是我国亿万军民在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下英勇奋斗的伟大胜利；是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的七亿中国人民和中国人民解放军，一定遵循我们伟大领袖毛主席的教导，更好地履行我们的国际主义义务，坚决支持全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民争取民族独立和解放的正义斗争，坚决支持英勇的阿尔巴尼亚人民的反帝、反修斗争，坚决支持英勇的越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底，坚决支持巴基斯坦人民维护民族独立、反对外来侵略的正义斗争，坚决支持克什米尔人民争取民族自决权利的正义斗争。
    巴基斯坦驻中国大使苏尔坦·穆·汗，以及大使馆武官海达上校、卡尤姆上校和其他外交官员出席了宴会。应邀出席宴会的还有各国驻中国大使馆武官。
