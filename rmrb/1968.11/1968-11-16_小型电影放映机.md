	Workers at the Wuhan Optical Instrument Factory, with a spirit of "seizing the day," have successfully developed a small film projector using 8.75mm film.

	The poor and lower-middle peasants in the mountainous areas of Hubei hope to have a small film projector suitable for mountain areas, so they can frequently see the glorious image of Great Leader Chairman Mao on the screen without leaving their production brigades. The workers of the Wuhan Optical Instrument Factory, in response to the urgent needs of the poor and lower-middle peasants in the mountainous areas, have been racing against time to develop a small film projector. In just three months, they successfully developed an 8.75mm film projector. This projector is small in size, and one person can carry it. The projector itself weighs no more than five kilograms, and with a small generator, the total weight does not exceed thirty kilograms. Although the projector is small, the screen is large, and each screening can accommodate five hundred viewers. Moreover, it is multifunctional, capable of projecting films and slides, serving as a radio, and broadcasting and transmitting sound. The cost is also low, making it affordable for every production brigade. Therefore, it is highly suitable for production brigades in mountainous and island areas, small factories, military barracks, and frontline outposts.

    小型电影放映机
    武汉光学仪器厂的革命工人以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，试制成功一种八点七五毫米的小型电影放映机。
    湖北山区的贫下中农希望能有一种适用于山区的小型电影放映机，以便不出大队就能经常从银幕上看到伟大领袖毛主席的光辉形象。武汉光学仪器厂的工人，根据山区贫下中农的迫切愿望，争分夺秒地进行了小型电影放映机的试制工作，仅仅用三个月时间就试制成功了。这种八点七五毫米的电影放映机，机体小，一个人就能携带。放映机自重不超过五公斤，加上小发电机，全重不超过三十公斤。机子虽小，但银幕较大，放映电影每场能容纳五百名观众。而且一机多用，既可放电影，又可放幻灯；既可当收音机用，又可播音送话。造价也低，每个大队都能购置。因此，很适合山区、海岛的生产大队、小型工厂和部队营房、前线哨所的需要。
