The brigade revolutionary committee meeting has concluded. Wang Yunting, the production team leader of Dafang, was still thinking about the comrades' speeches on his way back to the team: the urban youth coming down to the countryside this time are sent by Chairman Mao from the cities to us. We must welcome them warmly and make them feel the concern of us poor and lower-middle peasants. At this moment, Wang Yunting recalled the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao: "We all come from the rivers and lakes, for a common revolutionary goal, we have come together." He immediately felt his heart brighten. He took three steps at a time and returned to the team headquarters. The meeting to criticize and repudiate revisionism was still going on. As soon as he entered the room, he shared this good news with everyone. The comrades heard this, looked at the portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, and everyone was overjoyed. Everyone said in unison: "We must welcome the new comrades sent by Chairman Mao." How should we welcome them? The militia platoon leader, Wang Jizhong, said: "Before the new comrades arrive, we should prepare the best gifts to give them. I will give my most beloved, shining gold Mao badge to my new comrade." As soon as Wang Jizhong finished speaking, the meeting hall immediately buzzed with excitement. One person said: "I will offer the Red Book of Chairman Mao, so that these new peasants can read Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime and resolutely follow the path of integrating with workers and peasants." Another said: "I will paste the portrait of Chairman Mao in the new room, so that the new comrades' dormitory will always have the rising red sun." The women's team leader, Wang Junjie, eagerly said: "We will take over the revolutionary transformation of their dormitory environment." Finally, the representative of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Association, Wang Yunhai, expressed: "First, send the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, second, pass on the good style of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and third, teach agricultural labor knowledge." Everyone talked and laughed, continuing until late into the night.

The next day, the comrades took action in different directions, cleaning the new room brightly, waiting for the new comrades to arrive.

　　新社员到来之前
    大队革委会会议结束了。大房申生产队长王云廷在回队的路上，还在考虑会上同志们的发言：这次下乡的知识青年，是毛主席从城市给我们派来的，我们一定要很好地迎接他们，使他们感到咱们贫下中农对他们的关心。这时，王云廷想起了伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。”顿时心里感到格外亮堂。他三步并作两步，回到队部，社员们斗私批修的会还没有散。他一进屋，就把这个喜讯告诉大家。社员们听了，眼望伟大领袖毛主席的画像，个个喜笑颜开。大家异口同声地说：“我们一定要接待好毛主席给我们派来的新社员。”怎样迎接他们呢？民兵排长王继忠说：“在新社员到来之前，我们要准备好最好的礼物献给他们。我把我最心爱的金光闪闪的毛主席像章赠送给新战友。”王继忠话音刚落，会场上顿时沸腾起来。这个说：“我要把毛主席的红书献上，让这些新农民读一辈子毛主席的书，坚决走与工农相结合的道路。”那个说：“我要把毛主席画像贴在新房里，让新社员的宿舍里升起不落的红太阳。”妇女队长王俊杰抢着说：“我们要把他们宿舍环境革命化包下来。”最后，贫协代表王云海表示：一送战无不胜的毛泽东思想，二传贫下中农的好作风，三教农业劳动知识。大家谈哪，笑哪，一直开到深夜。
    第二天，社员们分头行动，把新房里收拾得亮堂堂的，等待着新社员到来。
