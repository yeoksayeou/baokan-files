The day after the communiqué of the enlarged 12th Plenum of the 8th Central Committee of the Party was issued, in Zunyi, in front of the "Zunyi Conference Site," crowds of revolutionary masses gathered from all directions, just like on a festival day. They solemnly held a rally to celebrate the issuance of the communiqué and to express their loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, and to the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. The broad revolutionary masses declared: We, the people of Zunyi, will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and will never waver, generation after generation.

The workers of the Zunyi City People's Printing Factory, with their profound proletarian feelings of boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, solemnly declared at the meeting: We fully support the resolutions of the plenary session and will resolutely carry out the great call issued by the plenary session. We will definitely do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation and present it as a gift to the 9th Party Congress!

The Zunyi City People's Printing Factory, with only 147 people, had 108 people labeled as "counter-revolutionaries" by the capitalist-roaders at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. The "Sixteen Articles" personally drafted by the great leader Chairman Mao at the 11th Plenum of the 8th Central Committee of the Party gave them the greatest support and strength, guiding them to break free from the white terror of the capitalist-reactionary line of the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi. Through their own struggles, they deeply realized: Following the great leader Chairman Mao means victory!

The issuance of the communiqué of the enlarged 12th Plenum of the 8th Central Committee of the Party made the entire factory's workers boil with excitement. They cheered, they sang, celebrating the great victory of the Cultural Revolution! They praised the most red, most red sun in their hearts, Chairman Mao, for his unparalleled wisdom and greatness! They looked at Chairman Mao's portrait and said excitedly, "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We, the red printing workers, will print your books for a lifetime, listen to your words for a lifetime, and forever follow you in revolution!"

Thirty-three years ago, veteran worker Yan Jisheng risked his life to print leaflets, notices, maps, and documents for the Red Army. He happily saw the great leader Chairman Mao at a mass rally. For thirty-three years, the great image of Chairman Mao has been deeply engraved in Yan Jisheng's mind, and every teaching of Chairman Mao has been deeply imprinted in Yan Jisheng's heart. At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, when the white terror of Liu Shaoqi's capitalist-reactionary line engulfed the entire factory, Yan Jisheng thought of Chairman Mao and firmly believed that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line would definitely win; when he and the revolutionary rebels together rebelled against the capitalist-reactionary line, he thought of Chairman Mao and firmly believed that the bourgeois headquarters represented by Liu Shaoqi would definitely be destroyed. Today, under the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the Cultural Revolution has achieved great, decisive victories, and the traitor, spy, and scoundrel Liu Shaoqi has been permanently expelled from the Party. When Yan Jisheng participated in the rally in front of the "Zunyi Conference Site" to celebrate the issuance of the communiqué of the enlarged 12th Plenum of the 8th Central Committee of the Party, he thought of all this, and his heart was filled with excitement! He said, "Thirty-three years ago, it was here at the Zunyi Conference that Chairman Mao's leadership over the entire Party was established. Chairman Mao is the supreme commander of our entire Party, army, and nation, leading us to one great victory after another. Sailing the seas relies on the helmsman, and making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. With Chairman Mao, there is victory!"

    遵义儿女永远忠于毛主席
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表的第二天，在遵义的“遵义会议会址”门前，象节日一样排满了从四面八方汇集来的革命群众，隆重举行了欢庆公报发表，向伟大领袖毛主席，向以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部表忠心大会。广大革命群众表示：我们遵义儿女永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，世世代代不变心。
    遵义市人民印刷厂的工人怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的深厚无产阶级感情，在会上庄严表示：完全拥护全会的决议，坚决执行全会发出的伟大号召，一定认真搞好斗、批、改，向党的九大献礼！
    遵义市人民印刷厂这个仅有一百四十七人的工厂，在文化大革命初期，就有一百零八人被走资派打成“反革命分子”。伟大领袖毛主席在党的八届十一中全会上亲自主持制定的“十六条”给了他们以最大的支持和力量，指引他们从叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇的资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖下冲杀了出来。他们从自己的斗争实践中，深刻地认识到：紧跟伟大领袖毛主席就是胜利！
    党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的发表，使全厂工人群众沸腾起来了。他们欢呼，他们歌唱，欢呼无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利！歌颂心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席无比英明、无比伟大！他们对着毛主席的画像，激动地说，毛主席啊，毛主席！我们红色印刷工人，要印一辈子您的书，听一辈子您的话，永远跟着您干革命！
    三十三年前，老工人晏继圣曾冒着生命危险，给红军印过传单、布告、地图、文件，在万人大会广场上幸福地看到了伟大领袖毛主席。三十三年来，毛主席的伟大形象，一直牢记在晏继圣的脑海里，毛主席的每一句教导，一直深深印在晏继圣的心坎上。在文化大革命初期，当刘少奇的资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖笼罩全厂的时候，晏继圣想起毛主席，就坚信毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一定会胜利；当他和革命造反派一起造资产阶级反动路线的反的时候，他想起毛主席，就坚信以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级司令部一定能被摧毁。今天，在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了伟大的、决定性的胜利，叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇已被永远开除出党。当晏继圣在“遵义会议会址”门前参加大会，欢庆党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表的时候，他想起这一切，心情是何等激动啊！他说，三十三年前，就是在这里，在遵义会议上，确立了毛主席对全党的领导。毛主席是我们全党、全军、全国的最高统帅，领导我们取得了一个接一个的伟大胜利。大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想，有了毛主席就有了胜利！
