Japanese farmers in the foothills of Mount Fuji hold a rally to resist the U.S.

	NEW DELHI, Nov. 19 (Xinhua) — More than 300 households of farmers in Yamanashi Prefecture's Shinano Village in Japan are continuing their struggle to demand that the U.S. military return the North Fuji training ground to them.

	On the afternoon of the 18th, farmers in the foothills of Mount Fuji held a rally. Young people, students, and women representatives from Tokyo, Osaka, and Kofu came to the rally full of fighting spirit. The farmers at the meeting unanimously emphasized that they would not be afraid of sacrifices and would persist in the struggle to reclaim the land.

	A leader of the farmers' movement spoke at the rally. He said: The struggle of the North Fuji farmers is an integral part of the struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." We must concentrate all our strength to carry the struggle to reclaim the land to the final victory.

	The rally issued a statement saying that Mount Fuji is a symbol of the dignity of the Japanese people. The U.S. military's arbitrary military exercises here trample on this sacred place, which is a great insult to the Japanese people. We cannot tolerate such crimes.

	A representative of students from Yamanashi University spoke at the meeting, supporting the farmers' just struggle.

	This rally is a continuation of the anti-U.S. struggle by farmers in the foothills of Mount Fuji. Last July, local farmers built a house inside the U.S. military training ground. Since then, regardless of wind or rain, day or night, a few farmers' wives have taken turns to stay in this small house to protest against the U.S. military's occupation of the land. Recently, local farmers, in response to the growing anti-U.S. military base struggle across the country, built a larger and more solid house inside the U.S. military training ground. A large red flag with the words "Demand the return of the North Fuji training ground to the farmers" was erected in front of the house. The rally on the 18th was held in front of this new house, demonstrating the firm will of the local farmers in their anti-U.S. struggle.

	The struggle of the Japanese people has forced the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to suspend their plan to conduct exercises at the North Fuji training ground from the 17th to the 23rd. At the same time, more than 200 households of farmers in Fujiyoshida City, adjacent to Shinano Village, have recently built a house inside the training ground and are preparing to launch an anti-U.S. struggle.

	WELLINGTON, Nov. 19 (Xinhua) — New Zealand sailors recently refused to transport U.S. troops invading Vietnam to New Zealand for a "vacation," expressing their protest against U.S. aggression in Vietnam.

	The U.S. aircraft carrier "America" arrived at Wellington Port on the 18th, carrying about 5,000 U.S. troops invading Vietnam. New Zealand sailors, in accordance with their decision made on the 14th, refused to use tugboats to transport these U.S. troops ashore from this aircraft carrier. The sailors' actions made the U.S. aggressors look ridiculous, and the New Zealand reactionary authorities had to temporarily mobilize some very small motorboats to transport them ashore.

	ROME, Nov. 19 (Xinhua) — The wave of mass struggles in Italy continues to rise. More than one million Italian workers and employees hired by the government went on a 24-hour general strike on the 19th, demanding wage increases.

	Those who participated in the strike included railway and postal workers, central and local government agency employees, and primary school teachers. This strike caused all government agencies in Italy to close, and railway transportation and postal communications were paralyzed.

　　不准美帝蹂躏日本土地　要求美军归还演习场
　　北富士山麓农民举行奋起大会
　　新西兰海员采取行动反对侵越美军到新西兰“度假”
    新华社十九日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本山梨县忍野村的三百多户农民继续进行顽强的斗争，要求美军把北富士演习场归还给他们。
    十八日下午，北富士山麓的农民举行奋起大会。东京、大阪和甲府等地的青年、学生和妇女代表斗志昂扬地赶来参加大会。农民们在会上一致强调说，为了夺回土地，不怕牺牲，坚持斗争。
    一位农民运动领导人在大会上讲话。他说：北富士农民的斗争，是反对日美“安全条约”斗争的一个组成部分。我们要集中一切力量，把夺回土地的斗争进行到最后胜利。
    大会发表声明说，富士山是日本民族尊严的象征。美国军队恣意在这里进行军事演习，蹂躏这个神圣的地方，这是对日本人民的重大侮辱。我们绝不能容忍这种罪行。
    山梨大学学生代表在会上讲话，支持农民的正义斗争。
    这次大会，是北富士山麓农民反美斗争的继续。去年七月，当地农民在美军演习场内修建了一所房屋。从那时起，不论刮风下雨，白天黑夜，总有几位农民妇女轮流到这个小屋里进行抗议美军霸占土地的斗争。最近，当地农民为了同全国各地日益高涨的反对美军基地的斗争相呼应，在美军演习场内又修建了一所更大、更坚固的房屋。屋前竖起了写着“要求把北富士演习场归还给农民”的大红旗。十八日的大会就是在这座新房屋的前面召开的，显示了当地农民反美斗争的坚强意志。
    日本人民的斗争，使美日反动派原定从十七日到二十三日在北富士演习场进行演习的计划被迫暂停。与此同时，邻近忍野村的富士吉田市的二百多户农民，最近也在演习场内修建了一间房屋，准备展开反美斗争。
    新华社十九日讯　惠灵顿消息：新西兰海员最近拒绝把乘美国军舰到新西兰“度假”的侵越美军运送上岸，以表示抗议美帝侵略越南。
    美国航空母舰“美利坚号”十八日载着大约五千名侵越美军到达惠灵顿港口。新西兰海员们按照他们十四日作出的决定，拒绝用拖船从这艘航空母舰上运送这些美军上岸。海员们的行动使美国侵略者狼狈不堪，新西兰反动当局不得不临时调拨一些很小的游艇来运送他们上岸。
    新华社十九日讯　罗马消息：意大利群众斗争的浪潮继续高涨。被政府雇用的意大利工人和职员一百多万人十九日举行二十四小时总罢工，要求提高工资。
    参加罢工的有铁路、邮电工人，中央和地方政府机构的职工以及小学教师。这次罢工使意大利全国的政府机构不得不关门，铁路运输和邮电交通陷于瘫痪状态。
