	Smash the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty"! Overthrow the Sato Government!
	Tokyo Workers and Students Hold Vigorous Anti-U.S. Protest March

	New China News Agency, November 1st

	According to a report from the Oriental News Agency, five thousand young workers and students gathered in Hibiya Park in Tokyo on the evening of the 30th, determined to further intensify the struggle to remove U.S. military bases, oppose the transport of U.S. military supplies, and smash the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and to carry the struggle through to the end.

	A worker representative at the meeting said, "The recent development of the anti-U.S., pro-patriotic struggle has opened a new chapter in the history of the Japanese people's struggle. We must learn from the experience of people's war, wage a protracted struggle, oppose all U.S. military bases, and oppose the transport of U.S. military supplies."

	The worker, in his speech, also severely condemned the crimes of the revisionist clique led by Muryo of the Japanese Communist Party, who have been slandering the anti-U.S. struggle and more brazenly acting as lackeys of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries.

	Kazumasa Uemura, a representative of the farmers of Chiba Prefecture who have been fighting against the construction of a new Tokyo International Airport by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, said at the meeting, "Our struggle is not isolated. We farmers are determined to unite closely with the workers and students who are at the forefront and carry the struggle against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries through to the end."

	A student at the meeting said that the enemy's brutal suppression of the people exposes their weakness and shows that they are terrified of the people's large-scale struggle. We students must unite with the workers and farmers and advance our struggle.

	The meeting ended with the rousing "Internationale." The participants then began a protest march.

	On this day, the reactionary Sato government mobilized a large number of armed police to suppress the demonstrators. The demonstrators fought back against the armed police. The demonstrators repeatedly shouted, "Smash the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty'!" "Overthrow the Sato government!" "Return Okinawa to Japan!" During the protest march, five students were arrested by the police without reason.

	On the 29th, about seven hundred young people and students also held a similar meeting in Hibiya Park in Tokyo.

	After the meeting, they defied the brutal suppression by the armed police and held a protest march with high spirits. (Photo attached)

  　粉碎日美“安全条约”！打倒佐藤政府！
    东京工人学生斗志昂扬举行反美示威游行
    新华社三十一日讯  据东方通讯社报道，东京的青年工人和学生五千人三十日晚在日比谷公园举行集会，决心进一步展开撤除美国军事基地、反对运输美国军需品和粉碎日美“安全条约”的斗争，并把斗争进行到底。
    一位工人代表在会上说：“最近反美爱国斗争的发展，打开了日本人民斗争历史的新局面。我们要学习人民战争的经验，开展持久的斗争，反对一切美国军事基地，反对运输美国军需品。”
    这位工人在讲话中还严厉谴责了日共宫本修正主义集团大肆诬蔑反美斗争和更加明目张胆地充当美日反动派的帮凶的罪行。
    坚持反对美日反动派提出要修建新东京国际机场而进行斗争的千叶县三里塚农民代表户村一作在会上说：“我们的斗争决不是孤立的。我们农民决心同站在最前列的工人和学生紧密团结在一起，把反对美日反动派的斗争进行到底。”
    一位学生在会上讲话时说，敌人大肆镇压人民，暴露了他们是虚弱的，他们对人民大规模的斗争怕得要命。我们学生必须同工人和农民团结一致，推进我们的斗争。
    与会者在高昂的《国际歌》声中结束了大会。然后开始举行示威游行。
    这一天，佐藤反动政府出动了大批武装警察镇压示威群众。示威者同武装警察进行了搏斗。示威群众不断高呼：“粉碎日美‘安全条约’！”“打倒佐藤政府！”“把冲绳归还日本！”在示威游行的路途中，有五名学生被警察无理逮捕。
    二十九日，在东京日比谷公园，大约七百名青年和学生也举行了同样的集会。
    会后，他们不顾武装警察的残暴镇压，斗志昂扬地举行了示威游行。（附图片）
