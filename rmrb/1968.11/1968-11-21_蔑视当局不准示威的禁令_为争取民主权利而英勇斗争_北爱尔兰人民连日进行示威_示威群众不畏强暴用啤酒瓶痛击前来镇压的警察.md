The people of Derry, the second-largest city in Northern Ireland, have been continuously holding protests and rallies in recent days to demand democratic rights and protest against the authorities' ban on demonstrations.

On the evening of the 19th, approximately three thousand workers and other residents, defying the government's order prohibiting demonstrations in the old city area of Derry for one month, gathered in the city hall square to protest against the fascist decree imposed by the authorities. After the meeting, as the crowd began to disperse, the authorities dispatched so-called "riot control" special police, who used high-pressure water hoses to attack a group of several hundred protesters. The demonstrators, undeterred by the violence, engaged in a struggle with the police, injuring nine officers.

On the same day, the people of Derry also formed lines and entered the old city area or held protests around the city walls. A group of several hundred dockworkers and male and female factory workers, formed a protest march near the city walls and fought against the police who came to suppress them. The protesters used beer bottles and other items to resist the police.

Since the 16th, when eight thousand protesters bravely fought with the police to demand democratic rights, Derry has been in the midst of a high tide of people's struggles. On the 18th, the authorities, under the pretext of "disrupting public order," tried ten participants of the large demonstration on October 5th in court, attempting to intimidate the people and suppress their struggle. However, the crowd was fearless. As the trial proceeded, about a thousand people held a protest outside the courthouse, and then fought with a large number of police in front of the city hall. Dockworkers near the city hall also went on strike immediately. They defied the government's reactionary ban, marched in lines, and passed through the old city area.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Stockholm on the 17th, more than three thousand Swedish people held a protest march and rally in Stockholm on the 17th to protest against U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam.

The protesters sang the "Internationale" as they marched through the streets towards the city center. Their banners read: "U.S. out of Vietnam!" "Smash U.S. imperialism!"

    示威群众不畏强暴用啤酒瓶痛击前来镇压的警察
    新华社伦敦十九日电　英国北爱尔兰第二大城市德里的人民群众，连日来不断举行示威和集会，争取民主权利，抗议当局颁布的禁止示威的法令。
    十九日晚上，约三千名工人及其他人民群众不顾政府当局关于一个月内不准在德里老城区举行示威的禁令，在这个区的市政厅广场举行大会，抗议当局实行这种法西斯法令。会后，当群众正在散去时，当局派出所谓镇压“暴乱”的特种警察，并出动了高压水龙去袭击一支好几百人的群众队伍。示威群众不畏强暴，同警察进行了搏斗，打伤九名警察。
    同一天德里的人民群众也纷纷列队进入老城区，或在城墙周围举行示威。由码头工人和工厂男、女工人组成的一支好几百人的示威队伍，在城墙附近同前来镇压的警察进行斗争，示威者用啤酒瓶等抗击了警察。
    自从十六日争取民主权利的八千名示威群众同警察英勇搏斗以来，德里一直处在人民群众斗争的高潮中。十八日，当局用“破坏公共秩序”的罪名开庭审讯十月五日大示威的参加者，妄图以此恐吓人民群众，把他们的斗争浪潮压下去。但是，群众毫不畏惧，当审讯进行时，约一千人在法庭外面举行示威，接着又在市政厅前同大批警察搏斗。在市政厅附近的码头工人也随即罢工，他们不顾政府当局的反动禁令，列队游行穿过了老城区。
    据新华社斯德哥尔摩十七日电　三千多瑞典群众十七日在斯德哥尔摩举行示威游行和集会，抗议美帝国主义侵略越南。
    示威群众高唱着《国际歌》，通过大街走向市中心。他们的标语牌上写着：“美国滚出越南！”“粉碎美帝国主义！”
