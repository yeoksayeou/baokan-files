The news of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party reached the southern coastal city of Zhanjiang, where the Albanian ship "Vlorë" was docked. The entire crew of the ship was overjoyed and spread the word. They, along with the workers of Zhanjiang Port, the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, and revolutionary cadres, enthusiastically celebrated the publication of the communiqué of the Twelfth Plenum, the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

The entire crew and cadres of the Albanian ship "Vlorë" held a meeting to discuss the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. They excitedly said: The publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought! Under the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have thoroughly smashed the evil plot of the traitor Liu Shaoqi and his clique to seize the Party, seize political power, and seize the military. They have thoroughly destroyed the bourgeois headquarters represented by Liu Shaoqi. The Albanian sailors pointed out that the decision to expel the traitor, spy, and scab Liu Shaoqi from the Party forever and to revoke all his positions within and outside the Party is "extremely wise and extremely correct. This is not only a great victory for the Chinese people but also a victory for the revolutionary people of the world."

Political Commissar Nelo Someda of the "Vlorë" said with revolutionary fervor: "The Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, led by Chairman Mao, summarized the experience of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and clearly pointed out the new tasks in the new situation. The communiqué shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, illuminating the path forward for the Chinese people and enabling them to advance with even greater strides. The Albanian Labor Party regards the victory of the Chinese revolution as a victory for the Albanian people and for all revolutionary people of the world. This victory of the Chinese people will undoubtedly have a tremendous impact on the world. Today, all revolutionary people of the world place their hopes in China and in the great teacher Mao Zedong." He added: "The great achievements of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in China, as well as revolutionary cadres and revolutionary intellectuals, also inspire the Albanian people to study more enthusiastically the works of Comrade Enver Hoxha and Comrade Mao Zedong and to engage more resolutely in the heroic struggle against imperialism and revisionism."

Party Secretary Riber Mukaj of the "Vlorë" continued: "Now, the international class struggle is very intense and extremely complex. Let us, under the leadership of the great leader of the Albanian people and the closest friend of the Chinese people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, and the great leader of the Chinese people and the closest friend of the Albanian people, Comrade Mao Zedong, unite more closely. Together with the revolutionary people of the world, let us carry the world revolution to the end and wipe out all imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries!"

Union Chairman Sami Ducaj of the "Vlorë" finally said: "The publication of the communiqué is a great encouragement to all people of the world and a heavy blow to imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries. Its impact on the world is immeasurable."

He also said: "Taiwan is sacred territory of China. The Albanian people firmly support the just struggle of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan."
