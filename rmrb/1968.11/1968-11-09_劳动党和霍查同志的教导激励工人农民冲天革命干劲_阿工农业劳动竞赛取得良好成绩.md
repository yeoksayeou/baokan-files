The Central Council of Trade Unions of Albania recently issued a communiqué stating that the Albanian working people, with a pickaxe in one hand and a gun in the other, have achieved very good results in the socialist labour competition in the first nine months of this year.

The communiqué pointed out that the working class, cooperative farmers, and other working people, inspired by the guidance of the Party of Labour and Comrade Enver Hoxha, have launched a decisive battle to turn 1968 into a year to complete the tasks of the Fourth Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

The communiqué said that most industrial and mining enterprises have successfully and ahead of schedule completed this year's production plan for the first nine months, and some have already started production tasks for next year. The working people, with redoubled efforts, have thrown themselves into the scientific and technological revolution, and initiatives to promote production have emerged everywhere. Agricultural workers, through selfless labour, have also achieved satisfactory results in increasing agricultural and livestock production.

The communiqué said that the Central Competition Committee of the Central Council of Trade Unions of Albania, in view of the achievements made so far in the development of socialist competition, decided to award the red banners and certificates of the Central Council of Trade Unions of Albania and relevant departments of the government to some advanced industrial and mining enterprises, state farms, and machine-tractor stations. The communiqué called on all workers nationwide to achieve new results in completing this year's production plan, especially in completing the autumn sowing and planting work as quickly as possible, so as to create a good start for the implementation of next year's production tasks.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Tirana, the production of grain, livestock products, and vegetables in state farms in Albania is increasing.

Under the inspiration of the vigorous movement to further revolutionize national life and people's thinking, many state farms in Albania have already completed and exceeded the planned output for the last year of the Fourth Five-Year Plan—1970— ahead of schedule. Currently, state farms are harvesting autumn grain crops. By the end of September, the grain delivered to the state by state farms has exceeded the plan by 21 percent, an increase of 52 percent over the same period last year. Although the state agricultural sector only has about 20 percent of the national cultivated land, it is a major supplier of vegetables, potatoes, fruits, rice, and other products in the market. Various state farms in the country have provided 7 percent more vegetables to the commercial sector in the first nine months of this year than in the same period last year, and 33 percent more potatoes.

	The workers in the tool workshop of the Tirana Tractor Parts Factory are grinding five-tooth milling cutters on a milling machine. This complex gear cutter, which was previously imported, is now produced in Albania.

    劳动党和霍查同志的教导激励工人农民冲天革命干劲
    阿工农业劳动竞赛取得良好成绩
    新华社地拉那六日电  阿尔巴尼亚工会中央理事会最近发表公报说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动群众一手拿镐，一手拿枪，在今年头九个月的社会主义劳动竞赛中，取得十分良好的成绩。
    公报指出，工人阶级，合作社农民和其他劳动群众在劳动党和霍查同志教导的鼓舞下，投入了把一九六八年变成为提前完成第四个五年计划任务的决定性一年的战斗。
    公报说，大部分工矿企业都已顺利和提前完成了今年头九个月的生产计划，其中一部分已经在进行明年的生产任务。劳动群众以加倍的努力投入到科学技术革命，到处出现促进生产的倡议。农业劳动者由于进行忘我的劳动，在提高农业和畜牧业的生产中，也取得了令人满意的成果。
    公报说，阿尔巴尼亚工会中央理事会中央竞赛委员会考虑到在开展社会主义竞赛中迄今取得的成就，决定把阿尔巴尼亚工会中央理事会和政府有关各部的流动红旗和奖状授给一些先进的工矿企业、国营农场和机器拖拉机站。公报号召全国职工在完成今年的生产计划，特别是全力尽速完成秋种秋播工作方面，取得新的成绩，以便为执行明年的生产任务创造良好的开端。
    据新华社地拉那电阿尔巴尼亚国营农场生产的粮食、畜产品、蔬菜的数量不断增长。
    在轰轰烈烈的国家生活和人的思想进一步革命化运动的鼓舞下，阿尔巴尼亚许多国营农场已提前超额完成了第四个五年计划最后一年——一九七○年的计划产量。目前国营农场正在收获秋季粮食作物，到九月底止，国营农场上缴给国家的粮食已超过计划百分之二十一，比去年同期增加百分之五十二。国营农业部门虽然只拥有约占全国百分之二十的播种面积的土地，然而却是市场上蔬菜、土豆、水果、大米等产品的巨大供应者。各地国营农场在今年的头九个月内向商业部门提供的蔬菜，比去年同期增加了百分之七；提供的土豆则增加了百分之三十三。（附图片）
