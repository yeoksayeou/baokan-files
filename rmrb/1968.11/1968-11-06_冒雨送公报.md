All the comrades at the Cheng'an County Post and Telecommunications Bureau are inspired and full of fighting spirit after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee's bulletin. During the enthusiastic study of the bulletin, Deputy Director of the Revolutionary Committee Zhao Yuncheng said: "Comrades! We must quickly deliver the newspapers to the poor and lower-middle peasants!" Before the words were finished, the deliverers said, "I'll take two thousand copies," "I'll take three thousand copies." In less than two minutes, they had reported a total of 23,000 copies. Before the discussion ended, the deliverers were already calling various communes to see how many newspapers were needed. According to incomplete statistics, the entire county needs to subscribe to 48,000 copies of the People's Daily.

November 2nd was originally the deliverers' rest day, but to deliver the newspapers with the bulletin to various communes on time, most comrades did not go home and were waiting to deliver the bulletin on Sunday. Waiting, waiting! Hoping, hoping! Finally, the newspapers arrived. As soon as the newspapers arrived at the bureau, the intense battle began. Some were making phone calls, some were loading the carts, and some were loading the bicycles. The front yard of the post and telecommunications bureau was like a market. In less than an hour, all 48,000 copies of the newspapers with the bulletin were delivered. We went to Xucun Commune to deliver the bulletin. Not far from the door, it started raining. We walked quickly, saying, "Hurry up, it's okay if we get wet, but it's not okay if the bulletin gets wet. If the bulletin gets wet, we can't effectively convey the voices of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. This is a big problem!" We walked very fast and arrived at the commune. They welcomed us very much and immediately called to notify each production brigade to pick up the bulletin at the commune, and also requested that it be immediately distributed to each poor and lower-middle peasant.

This is the fastest time Cheng'an County Post and Telecommunications Bureau has conveyed the voices of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, the result of the support of all levels of revolutionary committees in the county to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and the result of the revolutionary rebels of the post and telecommunications bureau actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

Long live the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Long live the great Chinese Communist Party!

Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!

    冒雨送公报
    成安县邮电局的全体同志，在党的八届十二中全会公报鼓舞下，人人意气风发，个个斗志昂扬。大家在热烈学习公报时，局革委会副主任赵运成说：同志们！咱们要赶快把报纸送到贫下中农手里去！话音未落，投递员就这个说我要两千份，那个说我要三千份。不到两分钟就报了二万三千份。讨论会未散，投递员又往各公社打电话联系，看需要多少份报纸。据不完全统计，全县要订阅四万八千份《人民日报》。
    十一月二日本来是投递员的休息日，但他们为了把刊登公报的报纸及时送往各公社，绝大部分同志都不回家，等着星期日往公社送公报。等呀，等呀！盼呀，盼呀！好不容易盼来了报纸。报纸一进局，紧张的战斗开始了。打电话的，装排子车的，装自行车的，邮电局前院真象赶集一样。四万八千份刊登公报的报纸不到一个小时全部分送出去。我们俩往徐村公社去送公报，出门不远，天就下起雨来。我们俩一面走一面说：赶快走啊，淋了我们不要紧，淋了公报可不行，淋了公报就不能很好地传达毛主席和党中央的声音，这可是个大问题呀！我们走得飞快，到了公社后，他们都非常欢迎，马上打电话通知各生产大队到公社取公报，并且要求立即发到各个贫下中农手里。
    这是成安县邮电局传达毛主席、党中央声音最快的一次，这是全县各级革命委员会高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗大力支持的结果，这是邮电局无产阶级革命造反派活学活用毛泽东思想的结果。
    无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
