Monopolists Chase Profits, Disregard Lives, Hearts as Cold as Snakes

A Coal Mine Explosion in the U.S. Leaves Miners in Misfortune

Eight Thousand Workers in the U.S. Die or Become Disabled in Accidents Daily

	NEW YORK, Nov. 21 (Xinhua) — Due to the intensified exploitation of workers by monopolists who disregard their lives, a serious explosion occurred in a coal mine in West Virginia, U.S., on Nov. 20.

	After the accident, the vice chairman of the coal mine company, knowing that more than 70 miners were trapped inside the mine and in grave danger, callously declared that “due to the concentration of fire and smoke,” any rescue attempt was impossible and “we can only wait for the smoke to clear.” He showed no intention of saving lives.

	It is reported that this coal mine has long had poor safety equipment, with coal gas permeating the mine. This year alone, the mine has experienced 18 major accidents.

	The explosion at this coal mine and the monopolists' disregard for workers' lives are typical examples of the current brutal exploitation of workers by the U.S. monopolist class. According to recent admissions by U.S. bourgeois newspapers, due to the intensified exploitation by monopolists, the intensity of labor has been increasing, and work-related accidents are on the rise.

	According to incomplete statistics, an average of 55 workers die in accidents daily in the U.S. due to the monopolists' disregard for lives, 8,500 workers become disabled due to accidents, and 27,000 workers are injured in accidents.

	American workers have enriched the monopolists with their blood and sweat, but many workers have been forced out of factories, left without a means of livelihood, and ended up on the streets.

    垄断资本家追逐利润玩忽人命心如蛇蝎
    美一煤矿爆炸矿工惨遭不幸
    美国每天有八千多工人因事故死亡或残废
    新华社二十一日讯　华盛顿消息：由于垄断资本家加紧剥削工人，不顾工人死活，美国西弗吉尼亚州的一家煤矿二十日发生了严重的爆炸事故。
    事故发生后，这家煤矿公司明知有七十多名矿工陷在矿内，生命危殆，但是这家公司的副董事长竟狠毒地宣称“由于火和烟的浓度”，“任何营救的企图都是不可能的”，“我们只能等烟消下去”，而见死不救。
    据报道，这家煤矿长期来安全设备极差，矿内煤气充斥，今年，这家煤矿就已经发生了十八次重大事故。
    这家煤矿的爆炸事故和资本家漠视工人生命的态度，是当前美国垄断资产阶级残酷剥削工人的一个典型例子。据美国资产阶级报刊最近招认，由于垄断资本家加紧剥削，劳动强度不断提高，工伤事故与日俱增。
    据不完全统计，每天美国平均有五十五名工人由于资本家玩忽人命而在事故中死亡，有八千五百名工人因事故而残废，两万七千名工人因事故而受伤。

    美国劳动人民用血汗养肥了垄断资本家，而许多工人却被赶出工厂，生活无着，流落街头。
