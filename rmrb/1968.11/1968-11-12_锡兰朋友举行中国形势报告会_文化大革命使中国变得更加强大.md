More than five hundred people attended a seminar on the current great situation in China held here on the 10th. Several individuals who had visited China were invited to give reports, and they enthusiastically hailed the great victory of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution in their speeches.

The chairman of the Sri Lankan Afro-Asian Solidarity Association, Mrs. Tega Gunawadana, presided over the seminar. In her opening remarks, she enthusiastically hailed the publication of the communiqué of the enlarged 12th plenary session of the 8th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. She said that under the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao and under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, the hundreds of millions of Chinese people have finally overthrown the bourgeois headquarters represented by Liu Shaoqi and its agents in various places. She quoted a passage from the communiqué: "Now, this magnificent proletarian cultural revolution has achieved great and decisive victories." Her opening remarks were met with enthusiastic applause.

Sennanayaka, the secretary-general of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau, who had personally witnessed the cultural revolution in China over the past two years and had just returned from China to Sri Lanka, said in his speech that the victory of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution is a victory of Mao Zedong Thought. It was Chairman Mao who pointed out the victorious course of this proletarian cultural revolution. Due to this revolution, China has become stronger than ever before. If the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists dare to invade China, they will surely be thoroughly annihilated.

A lawyer from Sydney, who had visited China in May, gave a report titled "Impressions of Today's China." He highly praised the role played by the Chinese workers, peasants, and soldiers in the cultural revolution and enthusiastically sang the praises of their deeds of wholeheartedly serving their country.

After the seminar, a Chinese film was shown.

　　锡兰朋友举行中国形势报告会
　　文化大革命使中国变得更加强大
    新华社科伦坡十一日电　五百多名群众十日在这里参加了以中国当前大好形势为题的报告会。一些访问过中国的人士应邀作了报告，他们在报告中热烈欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。
    锡兰亚非团结协会主席特加·古纳瓦达纳夫人主持了这个报告会。她在开幕词中热烈欢呼中国共产党第八届扩大的第十二次中央委员会全会公报的发表。她说，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下，亿万中国人民终于推翻了以刘少奇为代表的资产阶级司令部及其在各地的代理人。她引用了公报的一段话说：“现在，这个波澜壮阔的无产阶级文化大革命，已经取得了伟大的、决定性的胜利。”她的开幕词博得了热烈的掌声。
    亲眼看到中国两年来的这场文化大革命、刚从中国回锡兰的亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克在发言中说，中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利是毛泽东思想的胜利。正是毛主席指出了这次无产阶级文化大革命的胜利航向。由于这场革命，中国变得比以往任何时候都更加强大了。如果美帝和苏修胆敢侵略中国，它们定将被彻底消灭。
    今年五月间曾经访问过中国的悉尼亚律师，作了一个题为“今日中国访问观感”的报告。他高度赞扬了中国工农兵在文化大革命中所发挥的作用，热情歌颂了他们全心全意为祖国服务的事迹。
    报告会结束后，放映了中国电影。
