	Albanian "People's Voice" Praises the Brave Struggle of the People in Capitalist Countries
	The People's Movement Struggles Against the Capitalist System
	The Attempts by the Bourgeoisie and Their Lackeys, Various Revisionists, to Extinguish This Movement Are Futile

	NEW YORK, Nov. 11 (Xinhua) — The editorial board of Albania's "People's Voice" published an article on November 10, enthusiastically praising the recent brave struggles of the broad laboring masses, especially the students, in capitalist countries against the tyranny and brutal oppression of the reactionary authorities. The article exposes and condemns the schemes of the bourgeoisie and their lackeys, the revisionists, to sabotage and extinguish the revolutionary student movement.

	The article states that in recent times, the struggle of students against tyranny and social inequality has been more intense than ever in many capitalist countries.

	The article points out that the oppressed and exploited masses, revolutionary students, are raising their consciousness and strengthening their belief through struggle: only through persistent struggle and united combat, under the leadership of the working class and guided by proletarian ideology, can they achieve their aspirations and demands.

	The article states that the struggles of students and youth in capitalist countries reflect the decay of capitalist society. Young people now understand that it is the capitalist system that oppresses them, exploits them, and ruins their future. Therefore, the youth in capitalist countries are directing their struggle against this system that leads to disaster, suffering, unemployment, and humiliation.

	The article reveals that the bourgeoisie, flustered by the youth's rebellious movement, has received support from the revisionist parties in these countries. These revisionist parties, when the masses rise up to struggle, try their best to act as fire fighters and saboteurs. They use every means to separate the student movement from the working class, isolate the student movement, and thus easily suppress it. The Soviet revisionists are particularly active in opposing the student movement, and their propaganda machine attacks and curses the participants of these movements in a bourgeois tone.

	The article points out that the attempts by the bourgeoisie and their lackeys, various revisionists, to extinguish the youth student revolutionary movement are futile.

	The article concludes that the combination of the student movement with the workers' movement is an obvious trend. The youth of the capitalist world are gradually realizing that without concentrating their attacks on the root of all evil—the ruling bourgeois regime, and without combining their struggle with the most revolutionary and advanced struggle of the working class, even the most basic political demands cannot be realized. Therefore, the rebellious movement of students in capitalist countries should accept the leadership of proletarian ideology and the organized, revolutionary vanguard of the proletariat, and combine with the struggle of the working class within the country and internationally.

　　阿《人民之声报》赞扬资本主义国家人民的英勇斗争
　　人民运动斗争矛头指向资本主义制度
　　资产阶级及其仆从形形色色的修正主义者妄想扑灭这个运动的企图是徒劳的
    新华社地拉那电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》一日发表编辑部文章，热烈赞扬资本主义国家的广大劳动群众，特别是青年学生最近为反对反动当局的暴政和残酷压迫而进行的英勇斗争，揭露和谴责资产阶级及其仆从修正主义者企图破坏和扑灭青年学生革命运动的阴谋。
    文章说，最近，在许多资本主义国家里，比以往任何时候更为剧烈地爆发了学生反对暴政和社会不平等现象的斗争。
    文章指出，被压迫和被剥削的群众，革命的学生，通过斗争正在提高觉悟，加强这样的信念：只有以坚持不懈的斗争和战斗的团结，在工人阶级的领导下，在无产阶级思想的指引下，才能实现自己的愿望和要求。
    文章说，资本主义国家中爆发的学生和青年的斗争，反映了资本主义社会的腐朽。青年们现在懂得，压迫他们，剥削他们，葬送他们前途的是资本主义制度。因此，资本主义国家的青年把斗争矛头指向了导致灾难、痛苦、失业和耻辱的这一制度。
    文章揭露说，被青年的造反运动弄得狼狈不堪的资产阶级却得到这些国家的修正主义党的支持。这些修正主义党在群众起来斗争的时候，竭力充当消防队员和破坏者的角色。他们千方百计地使学生运动离开工人阶级，孤立学生运动，从而使学生运动轻易地被镇压下去。苏修在反对学生运动中十分卖力，他们的宣传机器用资产阶级的语调攻击和咒骂这些运动的参加者。
    文章指出，资产阶级及其仆从形形色色的修正主义者妄想扑灭青年学生革命运动的企图是徒劳的。
    文章最后说，学生运动同工人运动的结合是这些运动的一个明显的趋势。资本主义世界的青年正在逐渐懂得：不把打击矛头集中在万恶的根源——当政的资产阶级政权，不把自己的斗争同最革命、最先进的工人阶级的斗争结合起来，即使是最起码的政治要求也无法实现。为此，资本主义国家的青年学生的造反运动应当接受无产阶级思想和无产阶级有组织的、革命的先锋队的领导，同国内和国际范围内的工人阶级的斗争结合起来。
