	Officers of the Tibet Military Region who have long been stationed on the southwestern border of the motherland, while studying the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, were filled with revolutionary fervor. They enthusiastically hailed the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, which has opened up a new situation where millions of former serfs directly grasp Mao Zedong Thought!

	Everyone excitedly said: Today's Tibet, after the storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has thoroughly broken through the blockade by the great traitor Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Tibet against Chairman Mao's voice. With the help of the PLA's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams, from cities to mountain villages, from rural areas to pastoral regions, Mao Zedong Thought has never been as widely spread as it is today, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line has never been as deeply ingrained in people's hearts as it is today. The brilliant sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought shines over the vast plateau, illuminating the hearts of millions of former serfs. Mao Zedong Thought has mobilized the millions of former serfs more broadly and deeply than ever before.

	Comrades listed many vivid contrasts between things before and after the Cultural Revolution, illustrating the tremendous and profound changes in Tibet's social and spiritual landscapes. In the past, every household had clay idols; now every household hangs a portrait of Chairman Mao. In the past, there were "Mani piles" for gods and ghosts at every village entrance and roadside; now there are golden Mao Zedong Quotations towers, pavilions, and monuments at every village entrance and roadside. In the past, everyone carried prayer wheels; now everyone carries the Little Red Book. In the past, everyone carried amulets seeking blessings from the Buddha; now everyone carries a red bag containing "Quotations from Chairman Mao." In the past, people greeted each other with "Tashi Delek" (good luck); now people greet each other by wishing Chairman Mao eternal life and giving a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao." In the past, the masses burned incense, worshipped Buddha, and chanted scriptures every day; now the masses report to Chairman Mao every morning and evening, and sing "The East Is Red" every day...

	Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought has flourished extensively in the vast urban and rural areas of Tibet. The millions of former serfs, who suffered greatly in the past, have, through the baptism of the Cultural Revolution, developed a particularly deep class sentiment towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. Reading Chairman Mao's books has become their voluntary demand. The wife of Gongga, the chairman of the agricultural cooperative in the Diedong Township of Metok County, was blinded by the evil landlords in the old society. Now she often asks others to read Chairman Mao's works and the latest directives to her. She said excitedly, "Chairman Mao is our great savior. Although my eyes are blind, my ears can still hear Chairman Mao's teachings." Since last spring, Party, a former serf from Gelin Village, has been going to the PLA's station every morning, crossing mountains and valleys for over an hour, to participate in the "Daily Reading" sessions, regardless of wind or rain. Every evening, the family of Xorlang Doji, the team leader of the second production team in the Red Flag Commune of Chayu County, studies Chairman Mao's works together before going to bed. Sometimes Xorlang Doji goes out to work and comes back late, but they insist on waiting for him to come back, studying Chairman Mao's works, and then going to sleep. They say, "We can sleep less, but we cannot study Chairman Mao's works less." Budai, the party branch secretary of a township in Baqing County, had his eyes gouged out by traitorous bandits in 1959 while delivering a message to the PLA. Now, after diligent study, he can recite the entire "Quotations from Chairman Mao." He said passionately, "The traitors can gouge out my eyes, but they cannot gouge out my heart that is eternally loyal to Chairman Mao!"

	The broad masses of former serfs are the most loyal to Chairman Mao. They study and apply Chairman Mao's books and follow Chairman Mao's words to the letter. A member of a mutual aid team in Youka Township, Anduo County, had a few salt-carrying cowhide bags at home. In the past, he was afraid of damaging them and would not lend them out even if others offered money; after studying the "Three Articles," he followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, casting aside selfishness, and voluntarily lending the cowhide bags to class brothers without charge. For example, in the Caier District of Zhanang County, there is an old woman in her sixties who is physically disabled. In the past, she relied on the state for old-age support, but after studying the "Three Articles," she insisted on going to the fields to participate in labor, saying, "I also want to contribute to socialism!"

	Mao Zedong Thought, when grasped by the broad masses, produces tremendous material force. During the trial of the commune in Qüxü County, some farmers and herdsmen sold their cattle and sheep, seriously affecting production. What was the problem? It was not clear. During the Cultural Revolution, the PLA's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams helped the masses hold study classes. The masses studied Chairman Mao's latest directives on class struggle and "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," quickly raising their class consciousness and awareness of the two-line struggle. At that time, the masses who sold cattle and sheep bravely exposed the crimes of class enemies spreading rumors to sabotage the people's commune and severely criticized Liu Shaoqi's reactionary theory of "the extinction of class struggle," exposing hidden counter-revolutionaries and finally solving the mystery. The Monba ethnic group in the border areas, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, dared to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire. In the struggle to support the front line and capture spies, they took the lead, and some even crossed paths that goats could not pass. They said proudly, "With Mao Zedong Thought, there is no path we cannot pass!" Located by the Jinsha River, Gelangxi Township has a 70-meter-high, 200-meter-long cliff on the road to the district and county. Travelers had to climb a very high single-log bridge, making it very difficult to pass. During the Cultural Revolution, all the former serfs in the township studied the "Three Articles," their fighting spirit soared, and they said, "Yu Gong can move mountains, and we will also make the high mountains give way!" With the support of the county revolutionary committee, they, with the red sun in their hearts, shouting "Resolutely, we are not afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," fought for more than two weeks and built a road. On the day the road was completed, the masses shouted thousands of times, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!" The elderly were moved to tears, patting the flat road and repeatedly saying, "This is the happiness Chairman Mao has given us!"

	On the northern Tibetan plateau, a miracle occurred where the broad masses of herdsmen used Mao Zedong Thought to overcome a rare, severe snow disaster that lasted for fifty years: The Nagqu region of northern Tibet experienced a severe snow disaster last winter and this spring, lasting for three months, with temperatures dropping to minus forty degrees Celsius, and snow depths of over one meter in some places. In the old society, poor herdsmen either fled for food or faced certain death; this time, with the help of the PLA's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams, the broad masses of herdsmen studied the "Three Articles," fearing neither heaven nor earth, organized themselves, and fought a "people's war" to smash ice and sweep snow, battling against nature. They finally overcame this rare snow disaster, achieving prosperity for both people and livestock. An old herdsman, 75 years old, sighed, "Victory is all thanks to Chairman Mao! With Mao Zedong Thought, we dare to fight against the heavens and can defeat the heavens."

　　百万翻身农奴掌握毛泽东思想的新时代
　　——毛泽东思想在西藏地区空前大普及，毛泽东思想的灿烂阳光普照万里高原
    长期坚守在祖国西南边防的西藏军区部分团以上干部，在学习党的八届十二中全会公报时，满怀革命激情，以大量的生动事实，热烈欢呼毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，开辟了百万翻身农奴直接掌握毛泽东思想的新局面！
    大家兴奋地说：今天的西藏，经过无产阶级文化大革命的风暴，已经彻底打破了大叛徒刘少奇及其在西藏的代理人对毛主席声音的封锁。在驻藏解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，从城市到山寨，从农村到牧区，毛泽东思想从来没有象今天这样普及，毛主席的革命路线从来没有象今天这样深入人心。毛泽东思想的灿烂阳光普照万里高原，把百万翻身农奴的心照亮，毛泽东思想把百万翻身农奴空前广泛、深入地发动起来了。
    同志们列举了文化大革命前后许多事物的鲜明对比，说明西藏社会面貌和人们精神面貌的巨大、深刻的变化。过去家家供着泥菩萨，现在家家高挂毛主席像；过去村头路旁到处是为神鬼树碑的“玛尼堆”，现在村头路旁到处是金光闪闪的毛主席语录塔、语录亭、语录碑；过去人人手摇转经筒，现在人人手捧红宝书；过去人人身背祈求菩萨保佑的神符，现在人人身背着装有《毛主席语录》的红书包；过去人们见面第一句话是祝“扎西德勒”（吉祥如意），现在人们见面首先是祝毛主席万寿无疆，送一条《毛主席语录》；过去群众天天烧香拜佛念喇嘛经，现在群众天天向毛主席早请示晚汇报，天天高唱《东方红》……
    无产阶级文化大革命以来，一个活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，已经在西藏广大城乡空前广泛地蓬勃开展起来。过去苦大仇深的百万翻身农奴，经过文化大革命的洗礼，对毛主席和毛泽东思想的阶级感情特别深厚，读毛主席的书成为他们的自觉要求。墨脱县地东乡农会主任贡嘎的妻子，在旧社会被万恶的农奴主折磨得双目失明，现在经常请人念毛主席著作和最新指示给她听，她万分激动地说：“毛主席是我们的大救星。我的眼睛虽然看不见了，但耳朵还能听毛主席的教导。”葛林村的翻身农奴党真，从去年春天开始，天天早上翻山越岭，走一个多小时，赶到解放军的驻地，参加部队的“天天读”，风雨无阻。黑河县红旗公社第二生产队队长索朗多吉一家，每天晚上都要共同学习毛主席著作以后才休息。有时索朗多吉出去工作，回来得很晚，他们硬是要等他回来，学习了毛主席著作，才肯睡觉。他们说：“觉可以不睡，毛主席著作不能不学。”巴青县乡党支部书记布德，一九五九年给解放军送信时，被豺狼成性的叛匪挖掉双眼，现在他经过刻苦学习，已能把一本《毛主席语录》全部背下来。他慷慨激昂地说：“叛匪可以挖掉我的眼睛，但挖不掉我无限忠于毛主席的红心！”
    广大翻身农奴对毛主席最忠，他们对毛主席的书，学了就用，对毛主席的话，句句照办。安多县油卡乡一位互助组员，家里有几个驮盐巴的牛毛口袋，过去他怕损坏，别人出钱租，他也不借；学了
  “老三篇”以后，他就按照毛主席“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的教导，斗掉“私”字，主动无偿地把牛毛口袋借给阶级兄弟使用。比如县才仁区有个六十多岁的老阿妈，身体残废，过去依靠国家养老，现在学了“老三篇”，就要人带她到地里去参加劳动，她说：“我也要为社会主义出把力！”
    毛泽东思想被广大人民群众所掌握，就产生了巨大的物质力量。类乌齐县在试办公社时，发生了一些农牧民纷纷出卖牛羊的现象，严重影响了生产。问题在那里？一直没有搞清。文化大革命中，解放军毛泽东思想宣传队帮助群众办学习班，群众学了毛主席关于阶级斗争和“要斗私，批修”的最新指示，很快提高了阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，当时出卖牛羊的群众，勇敢地起来揭发了阶级敌人造谣破坏人民公社的罪行，狠批了刘少奇反动的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，挖出了暗藏的反革命分子，终于解开了这个谜。用毛泽东思想武装起来的边境地区的门巴族群众，刀山敢上，火海敢闯。他们在支援前线、捕歼特务的斗争中，奋勇当先，有些连山羊也过不去的险路，他们都闯过去了。他们豪迈地说：“有了毛泽东思想，就没有过不去的路！”位于金沙江边的葛良西乡，在通往区、县的路上，有一段七十多米高、二百多米长的悬崖险道，来往要爬很高的独木桥，非常难走。文化大革命中，全乡翻身农奴学了“老三篇”，斗志昂扬，他们说：“愚公能移山，我们也要叫高山让路！”在县革委会的支持下，他们胸怀红太阳，高喊着“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，奋战了两个多星期，修成了一条大路。在大路修成的日子，群众千遍万遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”老人们感动得热泪盈眶，一边摸着平坦的大路，一边连声说：“这是毛主席给我们的幸福啊！”
    在藏北草原，还出现了一个广大牧民用毛泽东思想战胜五十年来罕见的特大雪灾的奇迹：藏北草原的那曲地区，去冬今春遇到一场特大雪灾，持续三个月，气温降到零下四十多度，有的地方雪深一米多。要在旧社会，穷苦的牧民不是逃荒要饭，就是死路一条；这一次，在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，广大牧民学了“老三篇”，天不怕，地不怕，组织起来，大打一场砸冰扫雪、战天斗地的“人民战争”，终于战胜了这场罕见的雪灾，人畜两旺，欣欣向荣。一位七十五岁的老牧民感叹道：“胜利全靠毛主席！有了毛泽东思想，我们才敢和老天爷斗，才能斗赢老天爷。”《高原战士》报记者（附图片）
