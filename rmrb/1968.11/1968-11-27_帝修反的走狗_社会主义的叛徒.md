In the midst of the enthusiastic celebration by the hundreds of millions of military and civilian people across the nation over the release of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and as we earnestly study the history of the struggle between the two lines, we are also continuing to expose the heinous crimes of the traitor, spy, and capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi and his accomplices in betraying the Party and the nation. The reactionary film "Liu Shaoqi Visits Indonesia," once again, has been shown to the workers, peasants, and soldiers to expose it.

This poisonous film, "Liu Shaoqi Visits Indonesia," directed and performed by the traitor Liu Shaoqi himself, and supervised by his wife Wang ××, is a negative example. Through this film, we can see how China's Khrushchev, Liu Shaoqi, used the opportunity of a state visit to Indonesia to vigorously advocate for the "parliamentary road," peddle the black goods of Khrushchev's revisionism, and engage in frenzied anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought activities. Many scenes in the film prove that Liu Shaoqi, the number one capitalist-roader within the Party, is a running dog of U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, and a henchman of the reactionaries.

In 1963, the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world and Indonesia were surging. U.S. imperialism and its running dogs suffered heavy blows. To extinguish the flames of struggle of the Indonesian people, U.S. imperialism, together with its running dogs, plotted to establish the "Malaysia Federation" and tried to lure Indonesia into the "Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia Federation," attempting to piece together Malaysia, the Philippines, and Indonesia as part of a new crescent-shaped anti-China encirclement. Faced with these facts, as the leader of a socialist country, Liu Shaoqi, who usurped the position of "Chairman of the People's Republic of China," did not expose the evil plots of U.S. imperialism in his entire speech during his "visit" to Indonesia. He did not mention that U.S. imperialism is the most vicious enemy of all the people of the world. When discussing South Vietnam, Laos, Congo, and Cuba, he avoided the essence of the issues, never exposed the aggressive and war policies of U.S. imperialism, and never expressed support for the anti-U.S. struggles of the people in these regions. Even regarding U.S. imperialism's occupation of our territory Taiwan, he remained silent, fearing to touch even a hair of U.S. imperialism. Even Western bourgeois newspapers expressed surprise and "appreciation" for this.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power and consolidating power." "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." "The whole world can only be changed by the gun." The traitor Liu Shaoqi, however, openly praised the bourgeois government of Indonesia, flattered the leaders of the Indonesian bourgeoisie, attempting to deceive the Indonesian people and undermine their revolutionary will. What is even more intolerable is that Liu Shaoqi peddled the black goods of the Soviet Khrushchev revisionist clique, vigorously advocating the revisionist fallacies of the "parliamentary road" and "peaceful transition." He said that "leftists holding a few ministerial positions in the government can accumulate some experience in managing the state," blatantly suppressing the struggles of the Indonesian people and opposing the Indonesian revolution. This is the most shameful betrayal and sellout of the Indonesian revolutionary people.

During his visit to Indonesia, Liu Shaoqi also had a very ugly performance, fully exposing his role as a henchman of the Soviet revisionists and the Indonesian reactionaries in suppressing the Indonesian revolution. When visiting the crater of the Krakatoa volcano, the leading figures of the Indonesian bourgeoisie deliberately took the straw hat Liu Shaoqi was wearing and put it on their own heads, saying, "Khrushchev also wore a hat like yours when he came here." Liu the traitor showed no disgust and readily agreed, even taking the small black cap from the leading figure of the Indonesian bourgeoisie and putting it on his own head. The leading figure of the Indonesian bourgeoisie, delighted, pointed at Liu Shaoqi and said, "You have become a Muslim." Liu the traitor heard this and smiled broadly, overjoyed. This ugly performance clearly shows that Liu the traitor is indeed a Khrushchev-like figure. Like Khrushchev, he is a thoroughgoing running dog of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries, and a common enemy of the revolutionary people of the world.

The traitor Liu Shaoqi also betrayed our great socialist motherland during his "visit" to Indonesia.

Around 1963, the Soviet modern revisionist clique colluded with U.S. imperialism and the Indian reactionaries to form a counter-revolutionary "holy alliance," fiercely opposing communism, China, and the people. At this time, the traitor Liu Shaoqi, taking the opportunity of his "visit" to Indonesia, mimicked the tone of Soviet Khrushchev, viciously cursing our great leader Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and frenziedly attacking our great socialist motherland, acting as a echo of the international anti-China chorus. During his "visit" to Indonesia, Liu Shaoqi, under the banner of "Chairman," used the pretext of introducing China's socialist construction to viciously attack the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, the three red banners personally established by Chairman Mao. To cater to the needs of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries, he ignored the fact that China's national economy had fully recovered by 1963 and did not mention how, under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese people, with their revolutionary spirit of hard struggle, self-reliance, and striving for progress, overcame the temporary difficulties caused by the sabotage of the Soviet revisionist clique against China's economic construction and conquered the severe natural disasters rarely seen in history, achieving great successes in the construction of socialism. On the contrary, he picked up the words of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, viciously slandering that China's socialist construction had "spread the net too wide and the front too long," causing "economic imbalance," and engaged in shameless attacks and slanders against our great socialist construction.

The representatives of the Indonesian bourgeoisie, to show off the "strength" of the Indonesian reactionary army, specially rescheduled the "Indonesian Aviation Festival" to let the Indonesian Air Force perform for Liu the traitor, resulting in a mishap where a Soviet-made MiG aircraft crashed nose-first into the ground. At this time, the traitor Liu Shaoqi fabricated facts and blurted out, "It's okay, our air force also has such incidents." Liu Shaoqi, to comfort the leaders of the Indonesian bourgeoisie, fearing that his close friends would be angry, went so far as to attack our heroic People's Liberation Army and our great socialist motherland in such a heartless manner, which is intolerable!

During the "visit," the reactionary leaders of Indonesia repeatedly provoked the great Chinese people. They used the reactionary Malthusian population theory to hint at and attack socialist China for having "too many people and easily expanding outward." Liu Shaoqi did not refute or counter this but instead said, "Many people, of course, is a problem, but you don't need to be afraid.... We also use birth control to solve it." Liu Shaoqi, wearing the crown of "Chairman," such nonsense, is not intentionally helping the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, and collaborating with them to attack socialist China, what else could it be!

At a welcome banquet, Liu Shaoqi and his wife Wang ××, in the guise of "Chairman" and "Chairman's wife," joyfully followed the instructions of the leading figures of the big bourgeoisie, picked up the Indonesian bamboo instrument "angklung," and together with the right-wing generals of Indonesia, frenziedly played the tune "Mountain Alliance, Sea Vow, Never Change," jointly blaring the noise of anti-communism, anti-China, and anti-people. Every Chinese person who sees these scenes cannot but feel indignant and hateful.

Liu Shaoqi and the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries sat on the same bench and sang the same tune. Their evil deeds of colluding and conspiring were once again exposed to the revolutionary people of the world, revealing the reactionary face of the great traitor, great spy, and great capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi.

For a long time, Liu Shaoqi used every means to collude with imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries to sabotage the revolutionary struggles of the Chinese people and the people of the world. However, the forward march of the wheel of history is irresistible. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, the evil plots of the great traitor, great spy, and great capitalist-roader Liu Shaoqi have been thoroughly defeated. The great struggle of the Chinese people and the people of the world against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries will surely achieve final victory! Let us hold high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly uproot the big poisonous weed "Liu Shaoqi Visits Indonesia," and expose Liu Shaoqi thoroughly, so that he will be reviled for eternity and never be able to rise again!

    帝修反的走狗　社会主义的叛徒
    陈牟
    在全国亿万军民热烈欢呼党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报的发表，认真学习两条路线斗争的历史的时候，在继续清算叛徒、内奸、工贼刘少奇及其同伙叛党叛国的滔天罪行的时候，反动影片刘少奇《访问印度尼西亚》，再次被拿到工农兵群众中来示众了。
    这部由叛徒刘少奇自导自演，并通过他的老婆王××出马督阵炮制出来的毒草影片——《访问印度尼西亚》，是一个反面教材。通过影片，我们可以看到中国赫鲁晓夫刘少奇利用出国访问的机会，拚命鼓吹“议会道路”，大肆贩卖赫鲁晓夫修正主义黑货，疯狂地进行反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的罪恶活动。影片中的许多事实证明，刘少奇这个党内头号走资派是美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义的走狗，反动派的帮凶。
    一九六三年，世界人民和印尼人民革命斗争的浪潮正在不断高涨，美帝国主义及其走狗遭到了沉重的打击。美帝国主义为了扑灭印尼人民的斗争烈火，伙同他的走狗策划建立“马来西亚”联邦；并竭力诱使印尼参加“马、菲、印尼联邦”，妄图把马来亚、菲律宾和印尼拼凑在一起，作为新月形反华包围圈的一个组成部分。面对这些事实，作为社会主义中国的国家领导人应该在外交活动中充分揭露美帝国主义反共反华反人民的罪恶阴谋。可是，窃踞中华人民共和国“国家主席”职务的刘少奇，在“访问”印尼的全部讲话中，根本不去揭露美帝国主义的阴谋诡计，只字不谈美帝国主义是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。他在谈到南越、老挝、刚果、古巴问题时，处处回避问题的实质，从不揭露美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，从不表示对这些地区人民的反美斗争的支持。甚至对于美帝国主义霸占我国领土台湾，也绝口不谈，生怕触动美帝国主义的一根毫毛。对此，连西方资产阶级报刊也纷纷表示惊讶和“赞赏”。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”“枪杆子里面出政权”，“整个世界只有用枪杆子才可能改造。”工贼刘少奇却公然替印尼的资产阶级政权涂脂抹粉，吹捧印尼资产阶级的头目，妄图欺骗印尼人民，瓦解印尼人民的革命斗志。更令人不能容忍的是，刘少奇大肆贩卖苏联赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义集团的黑货，拚命鼓吹“议会道路”“和平过渡”等反革命修正主义谬论。他胡说什么“左派在政府里当几个部长，可以积累一些管理国家的经验”，明目张胆地扼杀印尼人民的斗争，反对印尼人民的革命，这是对印尼革命人民最无耻的背叛和出卖。
    在访问印尼过程中，刘少奇还有一场极其丑恶的表演，完全暴露了他充当苏修和印尼反动派镇压印尼人民革命的帮凶的反动嘴脸。在参观复舟山火山喷火口的时候，印尼大资产阶级的头面人物故意把刘少奇戴的草帽拿去戴在自己的头上说：“（苏联）赫鲁晓夫来这里戴的也是你这样的帽子。”刘贼毫无反感，欣然默认，而且还顺手将那个印尼大资产阶级头面人物的小黑帽子抢过来扣在自己头上。印尼大资产阶级的头面人物得意忘形地指着刘少奇说：“你成了伊斯兰教徒了。”刘贼听了眉开眼笑，欣喜若狂。这场丑恶的表演，正好表明了刘贼的的确确是个赫鲁晓夫式的人物。他同赫鲁晓夫一样，是个不折不扣的帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的走狗，是世界革命人民共同的敌人。
    内奸刘少奇在“访问”印尼的期间，对我们伟大的社会主义祖国又进行了一次叛卖。
    一九六三年前后，苏联现代修正主义集团勾结美帝国主义和印度反动派拼凑成反革命的“神圣同盟”，大肆反共反华反人民，其反动气焰极为嚣张。这时，叛徒刘少奇借“出访”印尼的机会，学着苏联赫鲁晓夫的腔调，恶毒咒骂我们伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，疯狂地攻击伟大的社会主义祖国，充当了国际上反华合唱队的应声虫。在“访问”印尼期间，刘少奇打着“国家主席”的招牌，以介绍中国社会主义建设为幌子，大肆攻击毛主席亲自树立起来的总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗。他为了迎合帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的需要，竟然不顾我国国民经济在一九六三年已经全面好转的事实，闭口不谈我国人民在伟大领袖毛主席英明领导下，发扬艰苦奋斗、自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神，克服了苏联修正主义集团对我国经济建设进行种种破坏所造成的暂时困难，战胜了历史上罕见的严重的自然灾害，在建设社会主义事业中已取得的伟大成就。恰恰相反，他却拾着帝、修、反的牙慧，恶毒污蔑我国社会主义建设“摊子铺得太大，战线拉得太长”，造成了“经济失调”等等，对我国伟大的社会主义建设，进行了无耻的攻击和诽谤。
    印尼大资产阶级的代表人物为了显示印尼反动军队的“实力”，特地把“印尼航空节”改期，让印尼空军专为刘贼作一次表演，结果弄巧成拙，一架苏制米格机来了个倒栽葱，嘴啃地。这时，叛徒刘少奇竟然信口雌黄，捏造事实，胡诌什么：“不要紧，我们的空军也常有这样的事。”刘少奇为了安慰印尼资产阶级的头目，生怕他的这群亲密朋友恼羞成怒，竟然如此丧心病狂地攻击我们英雄的人民解放军，攻击我们伟大的社会主义祖国，是可忍，孰不可忍！
    在“访问”期间，印尼的反动头子处处向伟大的中国人民挑衅。他们以反动的马尔萨斯人口论，含沙射影地攻击社会主义的中国“人口多，容易向外扩张”。刘少奇对此不仅不加以批驳和回击，还胡说什么：“人多嘛，当然是个问题，不过你们不要害怕，……我们还用节制生育来解决。”头戴“国家主席”桂冠的刘少奇，这样的胡说八道，不是有意为帝、修、反帮腔，配合帝、修、反攻击社会主义的中国又是什么！
    在一次欢迎晚会上，以“国家主席”和“主席夫人”身份出面的刘少奇和他的老婆王××，竟然眉飞色舞地在大资产阶级头面人物的指挥下，拿起印尼的竹制乐器“昂格隆”，和印尼右派将领一起，疯狂地合奏起“山盟海誓，永不变心”的乐曲，共同鸣奏反共反华反人民的噪音。每一个中国人民看到这些镜头，无不感到气愤和痛恨。
    刘少奇和帝、修、反同坐一条板凳，同唱一个调子。他们同流合污，臭味相投的罪恶事实，再一次在世界革命人民的面前暴露了大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼刘少奇的反动嘴脸。
    长期以来，刘少奇千方百计地勾结帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派破坏中国人民和世界人民的革命斗争。但是历史车轮的前进是不可阻挡的，在这场由我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，刘少奇这个大叛徒、大内奸、大工贼的罪恶阴谋已经彻底失败了。中国人民和世界人民的反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的伟大斗争，必将赢得最后的胜利！让我们高举毛泽东思想的革命旗帜，彻底铲除大毒草刘少奇《访问印度尼西亚》，把刘少奇批深、批透，叫他遗臭万年，永世不得翻身！
