In the joyous days of celebrating the publication of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, great news came from Jinggangshan, the first revolutionary base area in China personally founded by Chairman Mao: the heroic people of Jinggangshan, following the unprecedented bumper harvest of early rice this year, have achieved the best late rice harvest in history. Other crops also had good yields. The total grain production of some communes and production brigades for one season exceeded the total production of the previous year. Now, the people of Jinggangshan, inspired by the plenum's communiqué, are actively launching winter production to prepare for an even greater agricultural harvest next year.

Jinggangshan's bumper agricultural harvest this year is a victory achieved by the people of Jinggangshan through studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's Thought, emphasizing proletarian politics. They followed Chairman Mao's great teachings of "grasp revolution, promote production" and "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," insisting on studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's Thought, and vigorously emphasizing proletarian politics. Since this spring, they have held more than 280 sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with over 32,000 participants. The study classes, taking Chairman Mao's great revolutionary struggle practice as a shining example, extensively discussed the glorious struggle history of Jinggangshan, raised the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the participants, and used Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members, through studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's Thought, carried out in-depth activities of being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. At the same time, they fiercely grasped the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, seriously carried out revolutionary criticism and struggle, thereby greatly promoting the revolutionization of people's ideology and further establishing the ideology of farming for revolution and farming well with revolutionary spirit.

    井冈山人民获晚稻历史上最好收成
    在热烈欢呼党的八届扩大的十二中全会公报发表的大喜日子里，伟大领袖毛主席亲手创建的我国第一个革命老根据地井冈山传来喜讯：英雄的井冈山人民继今年早稻获得空前大丰收之后，晚稻又夺得了历史上的最好收成。其它农作物的收成也很好。不少公社、生产队的一季粮食产量，就超过了去年全年的总产量。现在，井冈山人民正在全会公报的鼓舞下，积极开展冬季生产，为夺取明年农业更大丰收做好准备。
    井冈山今年农业大丰收，是井冈山人民活学活用毛泽东思想，突出无产阶级政治的胜利成果。他们遵循毛主席“抓革命，促生产”和“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的伟大教导，坚持活学活用毛泽东思想，大力突出无产阶级政治，今春以来，先后举办了二百八十多期毛泽东思想学习班，有三万二千多人次参加了学习。学习班以毛主席的伟大革命斗争实践为光辉榜样，大讲井冈山的光荣斗争历史，提高学员的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，用毛泽东思想统帅一切。广大贫下中农和社员群众在活学活用毛泽东思想中，深入开展忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席革命路线的“三忠于”活动，同时狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，认真开展革命大批判，从而极大地促进了人的思想革命化，进一步树立了为革命种田和用革命精神种好田的思想。　　　（据新华社）
